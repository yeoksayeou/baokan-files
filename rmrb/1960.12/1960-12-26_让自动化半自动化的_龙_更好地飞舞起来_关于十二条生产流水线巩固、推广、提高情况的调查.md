Let Automated and Semi-Automated "Dragons" Fly Better
-- An Investigation into the Consolidation, Promotion, and Improvement of Twelve Production Lines
Working Group of the Industry Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

Recently, we investigated the consolidation, promotion, and improvement of twelve automated and semi-automated production lines that were realized during the technical revolution movement in the first half of this year. Since automated and semi-automated production lines are based on single-machine automation and concentrate various "four modernizations" achievements, we can see the various problems encountered in the consolidation, promotion, and improvement of many other "four modernizations" projects from the consolidation, promotion, and improvement of automated and semi-automated production lines, thus exploring ways and methods to solve these problems.

The Current Situation of Twelve "Dragons"

The working masses call automated and semi-automated production lines "dragons." These twelve "dragons" are: the semi-automatic steel rolling production line of Lianhua Steel Strip Factory, the automatic welding rod production line of Bincheng Welding Material Manufacturing Factory, the automatic biscuit production line of Yimin Food Factory No. 4, the semi-automatic cardboard box production line of Huasheng Box Factory, the semi-automatic toothpaste production line of China Chemical Industry Society, the semi-automatic injection production line of Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory, the automatic aspirin production line of Taishan Organic Chemical Factory, the automatic roller production line of Shanghai Petroleum Machinery Parts Factory, the automatic production line of Shanghai Automobile Parts Factory, the automatic tape recorder calibration line of Shanghai Recording Equipment Factory, the semi-automatic pin production line of Synthetic Hardware Factory, and the semi-automatic steel rolling production line of Shanghai Rolling Mill. These twelve "dragons" have undergone practical production tests through more than half a year of consolidation, promotion, and improvement work. The vast majority have now been basically consolidated and are in use, with relatively significant results. Only individual processes and individual projects cannot be used normally in production or have been dismantled. The specific situation is:

I. The production lines of five factories, including Lianhua, Bincheng, Yimin, Huasheng, and China Chemical Industry Society, have basically consolidated and are using all processes normally. After these five "dragons" were put into production, they significantly expanded equipment capacity, saved labor, and improved workers' working conditions. For example, the welding rod production "dragon" of Bincheng Welding Material Manufacturing Factory connects the original more than ten processes of manufacturing welding rods, including blanking, weighing, mixing powder, batching powder, sieving powder, wire drawing, wire cutting, powder coating, and drying, and implements semi-automatic production on a "dragon." Now, the production capacity has increased by one time compared to the past, and the number of workers has decreased from the original 202 to 175. Moreover, it has freed workers engaged in powder mixing, drying, and other work from heavy physical labor.

II. Most processes have realized automated and semi-automated production, but the technical key problems of individual processes have not yet been resolved, thus becoming a "broken dragon," which still needs to be reformed. This includes the production lines of five factories, including Xinyi, Taishan, Petroleum Accessories, Automobile Accessories, and Rolling. After these five "dragons" were put into production, they also achieved relatively significant results. For example, inspired and driven by the "seven-day revolution" of Lianhua Steel Strip Factory, Shanghai Rolling Mill caught up later and built a steel rolling production "dragon." After more than three months of consolidation, promotion, and improvement work, except for the steel turning process, where the technical key was not resolved and manual steel clamping was still used, the remaining processes were automated and semi-automated, and the monthly output level increased from the original 700 tons to 1,000 tons.

III. Two have been dismantled and are no longer in use: one is the tape recorder calibration "dragon" of Shanghai Recording Equipment Factory. After this "dragon" was built, it could only test and not calibrate. It could only test whether the product was qualified or not, but could not test where the problem was. It was completely dismantled before being put into production. The other is the pin production "dragon" of Synthetic Hardware Factory. Because the factory originally planned to change production tasks and no longer make pins, it was dismantled. Now, because there are still some pin production tasks, it is being reinstalled.

Technical Hurdles and Ideological Hurdles

Judging from the situation of the twelve "dragons," whether they have been consolidated and used or not, after the realization of innovation projects, they must go through two hurdles: one is the technical hurdle, and the other is the ideological hurdle.

The so-called technical hurdle refers to certain technical defects that have not been resolved after the innovation project is realized. The reasons for these defects are nothing more than two types: one is that the basic design principle is correct, but the design of certain specific structures is not perfect, or the manufacturing of certain parts is not precise enough; the other is that the materials selected for the innovative equipment are not ideal. For example, the automatic ampoule cutting machine in the injection production "dragon" of Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory. The basic design principle was practical, but because the ampoule feed channel was too large and the rotation speed of the transfer and cutting disc was inconsistent, the ampoule crushing rate was as high as 40% or more, making it unusable. The quenching furnace in the roller production "dragon" of Shanghai Petroleum Machinery Parts Manufacturing Factory and the baking chamber climbing chain in the welding rod production "dragon" of Bincheng Welding Material Manufacturing Factory required alloy steel materials resistant to high heat for some parts, but they only used ordinary seamless steel pipes and ordinary iron sheets, which could not be used for a long time because they were not resistant to high heat. Once these technical defects are resolved, the innovation project can be consolidated and used; if these defects are not resolved, it cannot be used normally.

The so-called ideological hurdle refers to the recognition and attitude of cadres and the masses towards newly realized innovation projects, which is actually the problem of recognizing and treating certain defects in innovation projects. Judging from the process of consolidating, promoting, and improving the twelve "dragons," when the "dragon" was first built, there was generally insufficient recognition of the arduousness and complexity of the consolidation, promotion, and improvement work, and it was thought that "there are not many problems left," so they breathed a sigh of relief, and the consolidation, promotion, and improvement work was not grasped tightly enough. When certain defects were exposed after the innovation project was put into production, especially when these defects directly affected the completion of the production plan, and the problems could not be solved all at once, a fear of difficulties arose again, thinking that "the fat meat has been eaten up, and the remaining bones are not easy to gnaw." In the face of these difficulties, a "struggle between indigenous and foreign methods" and a "struggle between relying on the majority or relying on a few people" arose again in many units. Wherever the correct ideology prevailed, adhering to the principle of "combining indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous methods as the main focus," and adhering to the policy of boldly mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses, the innovation project was consolidated and promoted quickly. Wherever there was doubt about the principle of "combining indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous methods as the main focus" and the mass line was not firmly implemented, the innovation project was consolidated and promoted slowly, and even could not be consolidated and promoted.

The technical hurdle and the ideological hurdle are mutually influencing and interconnected, and the good or bad passage of the ideological hurdle plays a decisive role. Because the technical hurdle was not passed, it made some comrades doubt and waver about the still imperfect innovation project, resulting in a fear of difficulties. And if the ideological hurdle cannot be passed, they will not go back and forth to overcome the technical key.

Several Basic Experiences in Consolidation, Promotion, and Improvement Work

Judging from the consolidation, promotion, and improvement of the twelve "dragons," in the process of passing the technical hurdle and the ideological hurdle, there are generally two different attitudes and methods in the following aspects. The ways and means to effectively solve the problems in these aspects are actually the several basic experiences in consolidating, promoting, and improving technical innovation projects since this year.

Before becoming a "dragon," it is necessary to rely on the masses to draw "dragons" and the masses to build "dragons"; after the "dragon" is formed, it is equally necessary to rely on the masses to manage "dragons." This is the first point.

Boldly mobilizing the masses and fully relying on the masses is the most basic experience in vigorously engaging in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on the "four modernizations" at the beginning of this year, and it is also the most basic experience in consolidating, promoting, and improving the achievements of the technical revolution. The welding rod production "dragon" of Bincheng Welding Material Manufacturing Factory relied on the method of "masses drawing dragons, masses building dragons," and became a "dragon" in nine days. Later, in the process of use, they mobilized the masses to "find" (find the key), "discuss" (discuss measures to solve the key), and "do" (take action to overcome the key), and one by one, they overcame technical key problems such as the landing of welding rods and hairiness on the surface, effectively curing the "dragon's" problems. Judging from the situation of this "dragon" and many other "dragons," innovation projects that are out of the masses' requirements, are conducive to production, and are conducive to improving the working conditions of the masses are easy to mobilize the masses to quickly realize. Innovation projects that are realized by relying on the wisdom and strength of the masses are also easy to mobilize the masses to continuously improve, so that they can be consolidated and improved. In fact, fully mobilizing the masses to carry out consolidation, promotion, and improvement work not only makes technical key problems solved quickly and effectively, but also makes the mass movement to overcome technical key problems a mass ideological education movement to educate the masses. It is passing the technical hurdle, and it is also passing the ideological hurdle. Some people no longer emphasize relying on the masses after the innovation project is realized, thinking that "the technical requirements for consolidation, promotion, and improvement work are high, and relying on ordinary workers will not solve the problem." After the realization of the cardboard box production "dragon" in Huasheng Box Factory, some people thought that "the earth equipment made by female workers is not good" and "wooden machines cannot solve the problem," so that the movement once appeared deserted. As a result, the cardboard box production "dragon" changed from a "living dragon" to a "broken dragon," and then from a "broken dragon" to a "dead dragon." Many workers returned to manual operation, and their thinking was once confused. Later, because the leading cadres improved their work style and insisted on relying on the female workers making cardboard boxes to overcome the defects of the machines they made themselves, they not only effectively overcame key problems such as glue lap joints and automatic gluing, and the "dead dragon" became a "living dragon," but also newly created equipment with a higher degree of "four modernizations" such as automatic roll cutters and automatic box painting machines. After a "dragon" was used normally, the work that originally required 40 people now requires only 16 people, achieving "one person is worth two and a half people." Some people who originally looked down on "indigenous" methods and could not see the creativity of the masses now sincerely admire and recognize the facts, improved their understanding; the broad masses were also encouraged, and the enthusiasm for technical innovation was even higher.

Relying on the masses means relying on the majority of the masses, including technicians, repair workers, and operating workers who use innovative equipment. Some comrades often fail to see the important role of operating workers who use innovative equipment in the process of consolidating, promoting, and improving innovation projects. They do not understand that operating workers, through frequent use, know best where the defects of the innovative equipment are and how to improve it to better meet actual production needs. Moreover, after the innovation project is consolidated, it is necessary to rely on them to change their operating habits and insist on using it. Therefore, any idea and practice that underestimates the role of operating workers in consolidation, promotion, and improvement work is wrong. When Xinyi Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory solved the key problem of the high crushing rate of ampoules in the automatic ampoule cutting machine, it initially relied only on technicians and repair workers to study and improve it. When technicians and repair workers came to the site to study and improve it, the operating workers left the machine to do manual operations; after the equipment was repaired and adjusted, the operating workers came back to operate it, but the repair workers left again, and the two aspects of repair and use were not well combined. As a result, after three months of work, the key problem was still not solved. Later, they organized technicians, repair workers, and operating workers to "combine," and the repair workers first became students of the operating workers, to understand the specific key problems of the innovation project from the operating workers; then they became teachers of the operating workers and improved it together with the operating workers, helping the operating workers to master mechanical repair technology. In this way, more than 30 key problems were solved within a month, so that the automatic ampoule cutting machine was officially put into production.

Secondly, after the innovation project is realized, it is necessary to insist on using it. Constantly discover problems in the process of use, so that it can be constantly improved and perfected.

After the twelve "dragons" were built and put into production, there was a process of abnormal use and production not being significantly improved, and even declining compared to before the innovation. In this process, as long as the innovation project has been tested and proved to be in the right direction and basically effective, it should be insisted on using it in production. In this way, the innovation project can be deeply observed, analyzed, and studied in the process of use, and the key and improvement methods can be found. Conversely, if the innovation project is abandoned and not used when it is not mature and perfect, and an attempt is made to wait until it is perfect before using it, then we will have no way to accurately identify the key problems and how to solve them. Even if you have the subjective desire to consolidate and improve the innovation project, in reality, the innovation project will not have the opportunity to be tested in practice, so it will not be possible to effectively discover defects and improve defects, and even some defective, immature innovation projects that have not fully shown their effects in production will be stifled in the bud. Of course, emphasizing the persistence of using imperfect innovation projects must also ensure the completion of the national plan. Emphasizing these two aspects at the same time will certainly bring many problems in actual work, which is also an objective reason why some comrades are prone to develop a fear of difficulties in grasping consolidation, promotion, and improvement work. Judging from the situation of the twelve "dragons," it is not impossible to implement simultaneous use and improvement, so as to consolidate and promote innovation projects and ensure the completion of the national plan at the same time. The key lies in the leading cadres establishing a comprehensive view of grasping production with one hand and grasping innovation with the other, and properly arranging the two tasks. When Bincheng Welding Material Manufacturing Factory improved the automatic baking chamber and automatic powder mixing equipment on the welding rod production "dragon," they used one machine for testing, concentrated their efforts to overcome the key, and temporarily produced the other two machines according to the old method, and mobilized the masses to tap potential, using two machines to complete the tasks of three machines. As a result, the technical key of one innovation equipment was broken through, and it could be promoted on the remaining two machines, and the production task was not affected at all, achieving "grasping production well with one hand and grasping innovation well with the other."

Third, focusing on the weak links on a "dragon," constantly engage in new innovation and creation, and constantly improve the production capacity of the entire "dragon."

A "dragon" is connected by single-machine automation on each process. Because the degree of single-machine automation and the effect of each process are different, although a "dragon" has connected several or dozens of processes and realized continuous and automated production, the capabilities of each process are not the same, and the production capacity of the entire "dragon" can only be balanced at the level of single-machine automation with lower production capacity. For example, the filling and sealing processes of the toothpaste production "dragon" of the China Chemical Industry Society have a very high daily production level, but the production capacity of printing and packaging is very low. Therefore, when this "dragon" was first put into production, some people once proposed to reduce the single-machine speed of the filling and sealing processes to adapt to the low level of printing and packaging, and to use this as a specific task for consolidation, promotion, and improvement. This is obviously a passive balance, not the balance we require, so it was immediately opposed by many comrades. Another balancing method is an active balance, that is, according to actual needs, constantly improve the single-machine production capacity on weak processes, so that a "dragon" can be balanced towards processes with high production levels. Implementing this balance is the correct policy for consolidating, promoting, and improving a "dragon" innovation project. The China Chemical Industry Society adopted this active balancing method, and mobilized the workers to adopt innovation projects such as quick-drying coatings and shortening the drying time on the printing process to improve the printing capacity. Now, on this process, they are trying to make a "three-in-one" single-machine automation, which originally used three machines to perform the three actions of cutting tail tubes, applying base color, and printing color. After this project is realized, it will further improve the printing production capacity. At the same time, efforts are also being made to improve the production level in the packaging process. In this way, not only will the "dragon" fly faster and save more labor, but by working in this direction, it will be possible to overcome a weak link and then grasp the newly emerging weak links, and then study and overcome them. In this way, from imbalance to balance, and then from balance to imbalance, and then from imbalance to balance, so repeatedly, it can adapt to objective needs and promote technical innovation projects to continuously consolidate, improve, and continuously develop forward.

Fourth, improve enterprise management to promote the consolidation, promotion, and improvement of technical innovation projects.

After the production line is officially put into production, it will definitely put forward new requirements for all aspects of enterprise management. If enterprise management keeps up accordingly, it will promote the consolidation, promotion, and improvement of technical innovation projects; if enterprise management cannot keep up accordingly, it will drag the technical revolution back, making it unable to consolidate quickly. After a "dragon" is built, the first requirement put forward for enterprise management is to adjust the labor organization. After a "dragon" is realized, it will save labor. If the surplus labor is not arranged in time, and the workers' work posts are not fixed according to the new process methods, it will become a negative factor in consolidating a "dragon's" production. When the cardboard box production "dragon" of Huasheng Box Factory was first built, because the surplus labor was not transferred out, some workers were idle and had nothing to do. When the machine broke down, the idle workers scrambled to find something to do, restoring manual operation, and no one cared about the problem of repairing the machine. Later, they adjusted the labor organization, fixed the workers' work posts according to the requirements of a "dragon's" production, and reduced the number of people from the original 40 to 26, cutting off the way to restore manual operation. The workers took the initiative to study and master machine technology, and actively repaired and adjusted the equipment when it broke down, so that the innovation project was consolidated. The semi-automatic box painting machine was also improved and upgraded several times to become fully automated after the workers mastered the mechanical performance and structure. After the production line was built, the maintenance work of mechanical equipment was required to be more timely and more frequent than in the past. During single-machine production, if one machine broke down, it only affected local production; after realizing assembly line production, if one machine broke down, it could stop several or dozens of processes on the entire "dragon" at the same time. Therefore, timely mobilizing the masses to learn and master mechanical repair technology can have a very significant effect on the consolidation, promotion, and improvement of a "dragon." After realizing automatic and semi-automatic production lines, the specifications of materials and packaging materials are also more stringent. Different specifications of shaped steel cannot be produced on a steel rolling production line at the same time, different sizes of ampoules cannot be produced on an injection production line at the same time, and different paper quality paper blanks and cardboard boxes cannot be produced on a box production automatic line and toothpaste packaging machine at the same time, and so on. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen raw material management and raw material incoming quality inspection work.

The improvement and strengthening of enterprise management can also powerfully promote the development and improvement of technical innovation projects. After the toothpaste production "dragon" of Shanghai Chemical Industry Society was put into production, because there were defects in the mechanical equipment, the percentage of toothpaste caps screwed on toothpaste tubes was very low. They established a toothpaste cap consumption quota system on the mechanical screwing toothpaste cap process, and the workers were very concerned about the percentage of toothpaste tubes screwed on by the machine. If the percentage was low, the workers would carefully observe and identify, analyze the mechanical defects, and study improvements; if the percentage was high, the workers would also carefully observe and identify and summarize experience. In this way, constantly observing and identifying, and constantly studying and improving, now the percentage of toothpaste tubes screwed on by the machine has been more than 80%.

These experiences prove that the relations of production must be suitable for the development of productive forces. Technical innovation and technical revolution have developed productive forces. When productive forces develop to a certain extent, it is necessary to adjust the way of enterprise management and labor organization, otherwise it will be detrimental to the continued development of productive forces. Of course, adjusting the way of enterprise management and labor organization only changes certain links in the relations of production. The relations of production have relative stability, and this stability is also necessary for developing productive forces within a certain range.

Leading cadres treating innovation projects with full enthusiasm and developing a down-to-earth and meticulous work style is the main key to ensuring the consolidation, promotion, and improvement of technical innovation projects. This is the last and most important point.

Leading cadres must first adopt a fully enthusiastic and actively supportive attitude towards the innovative achievements created by the masses, especially innovation projects with certain technical defects. If a cold attitude is taken towards innovation projects that cannot show great effects in production for a while, and the masses are not mobilized to identify, summarize, and continuously study and improve them, and even dismantle them, it will certainly not be possible to quickly grow up temporarily imperfect and immature innovation projects. When the cardboard box production "dragon" of Huasheng Box Factory was first built, it was imperfect and immature, and it stopped and started from time to time and could not be used normally. At that time, some leading comrades in the factory suspected that the wooden machine made by the workers was not good, and they had the idea of "cutting it off with one knife." If it had been cut off at that time, there would be no achievement of a one-and-a-half-fold increase in production now. Later, because they studied the article "How Marxists Treat New Things," improved their understanding, enhanced their confidence, checked their wrong ideas with the masses, went deep into the front line of production, analyzed the key with the masses, and besieged the key together, they consolidated and promoted the innovative achievements in just four days. This shows how important the ideological understanding and attitude of the leadership towards new things are to supporting the innovative and creative spirit of the masses and to the consolidation, promotion, and improvement of innovation projects.

In the process of consolidating, promoting, and improving technical innovation projects, leading cadres must also do a lot of specific ideological work and organizational work in a down-to-earth and meticulous manner. After Lianhua Steel Strip Factory's "seven-day revolution" succeeded in building an automatic steel strip production line, because accidents and shutdowns occurred frequently, some of the masses were a little discouraged, but they did not see the great achievements of their vigorous technical revolution. Therefore, the task facing the factory at that time was not only to pass the technical hurdle, but also to help the masses improve their understanding and fully mobilize their enthusiasm for innovating technology. However, at the beginning, the secretary of the factory's party branch did not persist in carrying forward the fine style of sharing weal and woe with the masses at the beginning of this year, and subjectively believed that the accidents were caused by the workers' improper operation, and simply criticized and blamed the workers. In this way, the enthusiasm of the workers was affected, and the technical key was not solved for a long time. Later, the branch secretary improved his work style, went deep into the front line of production, worked, consulted, and discussed with the masses, and discovered the cause of the accidents. After mobilizing the masses to improve the parts, no accidents have occurred since then, and the production level has also improved rapidly. The achievements of the technical revolution showed its superiority in production, the thinking of the masses was also improved, and the enthusiasm for innovation and creation was further fully mobilized.

Now, these twelve factories have preliminary plans for further consolidating, promoting, and improving the innovative achievements of the twelve "dragons" in the future. Synthetic Hardware Factory and Shanghai Recording Equipment Factory, which had dismantled a "dragon" in the previous period, have reinstalled the "dragon." Shanghai Recording Equipment Factory also plans to organize forces to further identify, summarize, study, and improve the automatic tape recorder calibration line after it is rebuilt. These twelve factories will, in accordance with the requirements of production development, make the twelve "dragons" even more refined, continuously improve the degree of automation, continuously improve production capacity, and universally engage in the consolidation, promotion, and improvement of innovation projects in all other production links, promote the wheels of the technical revolution to continuously roll forward, and ensure the continuous leap forward in production.

    让自动化半自动化的“龙”更好地飞舞起来
    ——关于十二条生产流水线巩固、推广、提高情况的调查
    中共上海市委工业工作部工作组
    最近，我们调查了今年上半年技术革命运动中实现的十二条自动化半自动化生产流水线的巩固、推广、提高的情况。由于自动化半自动化生产流水线是以单机自动化为基础，集中了各种“四化”成就，因此，从自动化半自动化生产流水线的巩固、推广、提高过程中，很可以看出其他许多“四化”项目在巩固、推广、提高过程中遇到的各类问题，从而摸索出如何解决这些问题的途径和方法。
    十二条“龙”的现状
    工人群众把自动化半自动化生产流水线称之为“龙”。这十二条“龙”是：联华带钢厂轧钢半自动生产流水线、斌诚电焊材料制造厂电焊条自动生产流水线、益民食品四厂饼干自动生产流水线、华生制盒厂纸盒半自动生产流水线、中国化学工业社牙膏半自动生产流水线、信谊化学制药厂针剂半自动生产流水线、泰山有机化工厂阿斯匹林自动生产流水线、上海石油机械配件厂自动化滚柱生产流水线、上海汽车配件厂自动化生产流水线、上海录音器材厂自动化录音机校验线、合成五金厂半自动化别针生产流水线、上海压延厂半自动轧钢生产流水线。这十二条“龙”经过半年多来的巩固、推广、提高工作，经受了生产上的实际考验，现在极大多数都已基本巩固、使用，效果也较显著，至今还不能在生产上正常使用或者被拆除不用的只是个别工序和个别项目。具体情况是：
    一、各道工序都已经基本巩固、使用正常的有联华、斌诚、益民、华生和中国化学工业社等五厂的生产流水线。这五条“龙”投入生产以后，都显著地扩大了设备能力，节约了劳动力，改善了工人劳动条件。例如，斌诚电焊材料制造厂的电焊条生产一条“龙”，把原来制造电焊条要经过落料、过磅、拌粉、配粉、筛粉、拉丝、切丝、上粉、烘干等繁多的十多道工序联接起来，在一条“龙”上实行半自动化生产。现在生产能力比过去提高了一倍，工人从原来的二百零二人减少到一百七十五人，而且使原来从事配粉、烘干等工作的工人从繁重的体力劳动中解放出来。
    二、大部分工序都实现了自动化、半自动化生产，个别工序的技术关键问题还没有解决，因而成为一条“断龙”，还须继续改革的，有信谊、泰山、石油配件、汽车配件和压延等五厂的生产流水线。这五条“龙”投入生产后，也取得了比较显著的效果。例如，上海压延厂在联华带钢厂“七天革个命”的启发和带动下，后来居上，建成轧钢生产一条“龙”以后，经过三个多月的巩固、推广、提高工作，除翻钢一道工序的技术关键没有解决，仍采用手工箝钢以外，其余工序都实现了自动化半自动化，月产量水平从原来的七百吨提高到一千吨。
    三、已被拆除不用的有二条：一条是上海录音器材厂的录音机校验一条“龙”。这条“龙”建成后，因只能验不能校，只能验出产品合格不合格，不能验出毛病在哪里，未投入生产就被全部拆掉；一条是合成五金厂的别针生产一条“龙”。因为这个厂原计划改变生产任务，不做别针了，因此被拆除。现在因仍有部分别针生产任务，又在重新安装中。
    技术关和思想关
    从十二条“龙”的情况看来，不论是现在已经巩固、使用了的，还是没有巩固的，在革新项目实现以后，都要经过这样两个关：一个是技术关，一个是思想关。
    所谓技术关，就是革新项目实现以后，在技术上还没有解决的某些缺陷。造成这些缺陷的原因，不外是两种：一种是设计的基本原理正确，但某些具体结构的设计不够完善，或者某些零件制造不够精密；另一种是由于革新设备所选用的材料不够理想。例如，信谊药厂针剂生产一条“龙”中有一台自动割瓶机，设计的基本原理是切合实际的，但是因为进瓶路规太大，传送与割瓶盘的转速不一，因此安瓿挤碎的比率曾高达40％以上，无法使用。上海石油机械配件制造厂滚柱生产一条“龙”中的淬火炉，斌诚电焊材料制造厂电焊条生产一条“龙”中的烘房爬链，部分零件需要耐高热的合金钢材，但他们只用普通无缝钢管和普通铁皮，都因不耐高热，不能持久使用。这些技术上的缺陷问题解决了，革新项目就能巩固、使用了；这些缺陷不解决，就不能正常使用。
    所谓思想关，就是干部和群众对新实现的革新项目的认识和态度，实际上也就是对待革新项目的某些缺陷的认识和态度问题。从十二条“龙”的巩固、推广、提高的过程来看，在“龙”刚建成时，一般都对巩固、推广、提高工作的艰巨性和复杂性认识不足，认为“留下来的问题不多了”，因而松了一口气，巩固、推广、提高工作也就抓得不紧了。等到革新项目投入生产以后暴露了某些缺陷，特别是这些缺陷直接影响到生产计划的完成，而问题又不是一下子可以解决时，就又产生了畏难情绪，认为“肥肉吃光了，剩下来的骨头不好啃了”。在这些困难面前，不少单位里又一次产生了“土洋之争”和“依靠多数人还是依靠少数人之争”。凡是正确的思想占据了上风，坚持“土洋结合、土法为主”，坚持放手发动群众、依靠群众的，革新项目就巩固、推广得快，凡是对“土洋结合、土法为主”的方针和对群众路线发生怀疑，贯彻执行不坚定的，革新项目就巩固、推广得慢，甚至得不到巩固、推广。
    技术关和思想关是相互影响、相互联系的，而思想关过得好与不好，则起着决定性的作用。因为技术关没有过，就使一部分同志对还不怎么完善的革新项目怀疑、动摇，产生畏难情绪。而思想关过不去，就不会百折不回地去攻克技术关键。
    巩固、推广、提高工作的几条基本经验
    从十二条“龙”巩固、推广、提高的情况看来，在过技术关和思想关的过程中，一般地都从以下几个方面表现出两种不同的态度和方法来。切切实实地解决这几个方面的问题的办法和途径，实际上也就是今年以来巩固、推广、提高技术革新项目的几个基本经验。
    成“龙”以前要依靠群众画“龙”，群众造“龙”；“龙”成以后同样要依靠群众治“龙”。这是第一条。
    放手发动群众，充分依靠群众，是今年年初大搞以“四化”为中心的技术革新技术革命运动的一条最基本的经验，也是巩固、推广、提高技术革命成果的一条最基本的经验。斌诚电焊材料制造厂电焊条生产一条“龙”，依靠“群众画龙，群众造龙”的办法，九天就成了“龙”。以后，又在使用过程中发动群众“找”（找关键）、“议”（讨论解决关键的措施）、“干”（动手攻关键），一个一个地攻克了焊条落地、表面发毛等技术关键问题，把一条“龙”的毛病有效地治好了。从这条“龙”和其他许多条“龙”的情况看来，凡是出于群众的要求，有利于生产，有利于改善群众劳动条件的技术革新项目，就易于动员群众迅速实现。凡是依靠群众的智慧和力量实现的革新项目，又易于动员群众不断加以完善，使之巩固、提高。实际上，充分发动群众搞巩固、推广、提高工作，不仅使技术关键问题解决得又快又有效，而且还可以使攻技术关键的群众运动，成为群众教育群众的思想教育运动。是过技术关，同时也是过思想关。有些人在革新项目实现后，就不再强调依靠群众了，认为“巩固、推广、提高工作的技术要求高，依靠一般工人不解决问题了”。华生制盒厂制盒生产一条“龙”实现后，就有人认为：“女工做的土设备不行”，“木头机器不解决问题”，以致运动一度出现冷冷清清的局面。结果，制盒生产的一条“龙”从“活龙”变成“断龙”，又从“断龙”变成“死龙”。很多工人都恢复手工操作，思想也曾一度陷于混乱。后来，由于领导干部改进作风，坚持依靠制盒女工动手克服她们亲手制造的机器的缺陷，结果不仅有效地克服了胶水搭头、自动加浆等关键问题，“死龙”变成了“活龙”，而且还新创造了自动割卷刀、自动漆盒机等“四化”程度更高的设备。一条“龙”正常使用以后，原来要四十个人做的活，现在十六个人就够了，做到“一个人顶两个半人”。原来有些看不起“土”法、看不到群众创造力的人，现在在事实面前也口服心服，提高了认识；广大群众也受到了鼓舞，技术革新的积极性更为高涨。
    依靠群众是依靠群众中的多数，包括技术人员、机修工人和使用革新设备的操作工人。有些同志却往往看不到使用革新设备的操作工人在革新项目巩固、推广、提高过程中的重要作用。他们不了解，操作工人通过经常使用，最了解革新的设备缺陷在哪里，最懂得怎样改进才更切合生产实际要求。而且革新项目巩固以后，还要依靠他们改变自己的操作习惯，坚持使用，因此，任何低估操作工人在巩固、推广、提高工作中的作用的想法和做法，都是错误的。信谊化学制药厂在解决自动割瓶机安瓿轧碎率高的关键问题时，起初只依靠技术人员和机修工人去研究改进。技术人员、机修工人来到现场研究改进时，操作工人离开机台，去做手工操作；等设备修好、调整好了以后，操作工人再回来操作，机修工人却又走了，修理和使用两方面的人没有很好地结合起来。结果，搞了三个月，关键问题还是没有解决。后来，他们组织技术人员、机修工人和操作工人“三结合”，机修工人先做操作工人的学生，向操作工人了解革新项目的具体关键问题；然后再做操作工人的先生，和操作工人一起改进，帮助操作工人掌握机械修理技术。这样，一个月之内就解决了三十多个关键问题，使自动割瓶机正式投入了生产。
    其次，革新项目实现后，就要坚持使用。在使用过程中不断发现问题，使之不断改进，不断完善。
    十二条“龙”刚建成投入生产以后，都有一个使用不正常和生产不能显著提高，甚至比革新以前还要下降的过程。在这个过程中，只要革新项目经过试验，证明方向对头，基本有效，就应该在生产中坚持使用。这样，就可以在使用过程中，对革新项目进行深入的观察、分析、研究，找出关键所在和改进办法。相反，如果在革新项目还不成熟、还不完善时就放弃不用，企图等到十全十美时再用，这样就使我们无从确切地摸清关键问题在哪里，应该怎样去解决，即使你有巩固和提高革新项目的主观愿望，而在实际上却使革新项目得不到实践考验的机会，因而就不能有效地发现缺陷，改进缺陷，甚至使一些有缺陷的、还不成熟的、在生产上还没有充分显示效果的革新项目，在萌芽时期就被扼杀了。当然，强调坚持使用还不完善的革新项目，必须同时保证完成国家计划。同时强调这两个方面，当然会在实际工作中带来很多问题，这也正是有些同志在抓巩固、推广、提高工作中容易滋长畏难情绪的一个客观原因。从十二条“龙”的情况看来，实行边使用、边改进，做到既巩固推广革新项目、又保证完成国家计划，并不是不可能的。关键在于领导干部确立一手抓生产、一手抓革新的全面观点，把两个工作妥善安排。斌诚电焊材料制造厂在改进电焊条生产一条“龙”上的自动烘房、自动配粉等设备时，以一台做试验，集中力量攻关键，另两台暂时按老办法生产，并且发动群众挖掘潜力，以二台设备完成三台设备的任务。结果一台革新设备的技术关键突破了，就可以在其余两台机台上推广，同时生产任务也一点不受影响，做到了“一手抓好生产，一手抓好革新”。
    第三，针对一条“龙”上的薄弱环节，不断从事新的革新创造，不断提高整条“龙”的生产能力。
    一条“龙”是由各个工序上的单机自动化联结起来的。由于各个工序单机自动化的程度不同，效果不同，因此，虽然一条“龙”已经把几道、十几道工序联结起来，实现了连续化、自动化生产，但是各个工序的能力并不相同，整条“龙”的生产能力，则只能在生产能力较低的单机自动化水平上求得平衡。例如，中国化学工业社牙膏生产一条“龙”，灌装、封口二道工序日产水平很高，但印色和包装的生产能力却很低。因此，这条“龙”刚投入生产时，曾经有人提出要减低灌装、封口两道工序的单机转速，使之与印色、包装的低水平相适应，并以此作为巩固、推广、提高的具体任务。这显然是一种消极平衡，而不是我们所要求的平衡，因此立即受到了许多同志的反对。另外一种平衡方法是积极的平衡，就是根据实际需要，不断提高薄弱工序上的单机生产能力，使一条“龙”向高生产水平的工序平衡。实行这种平衡，才是巩固。推广、提高一条“龙”革新项目的正确方针。中国化学工业社采取了这种积极平衡的方法，发动工人群众在印色一道工序上采用快干涂料、缩短烘燥时间等革新项目，提高印色能力，现在又在这道工序上把原来由三台机器进行割尾管、涂本色、印彩色三个动作，试制成“三合一”单机自动化。这个项目实现后，又将进一步提高印色生产能力。同时，在包装工序上也设法提高生产水平。这样，就不仅使“龙”飞舞更快，劳动力更省，而且朝着这个方向努力，就可以在克服了一个薄弱环节以后，又去抓新出现的薄弱环节，再去研究克服，这样从不平衡到平衡，又从平衡到不平衡，再从不平衡到平衡，如此循环往复，就可以适应客观需要，推动技术革新项目不断巩固、提高，不断向前发展。
    第四，改进企业管理工作，推动技术革新项目的巩固、推广、提高。
    生产流水线正式投入生产以后，就一定会向企业管理的各方面工作提出新的要求。如果企业管理工作相应地跟上去，就会推动技术革新项目的巩固、推广、提高；如果企业管理工作不能相应跟上，就会拖技术革命的后腿，使它不能迅速巩固下来。一条“龙”建成以后，首先向企业管理工作提出的要求是调整劳动组织。一条“龙”实现后，就会节约出劳动力来。如果多余劳动力不及时安排好，不根据新的工艺方法固定工人的工作岗位，就会成为巩固一条“龙”生产的消极因素。华生制盒厂制盒生产一条“龙”刚建成时，因为没有把多余劳动力抽调出来，有些工人闲着没有事做。机器坏了，没事做的工人都抢着找事做，恢复了手工操作，修机器的问题倒反而没有人关心了。后来，他们调整劳动组织，根据一条“龙”生产的要求，固定工人工作岗位，人数从原来四十人减少到二十六人，断了恢复手工操作的后路，工人就主动钻研掌握机器技术，设备坏了就积极修理、调整，使革新项目巩固下来。半自动化漆盒机，还在工人掌握了机械性能和结构以后，几次作了改进、提高，改成了全自动化。生产一条“龙”建成后，机械设备的维修工作，要求比过去更及时、更经常。单机生产时，一台机械坏了，还只使局部生产受到影响；实现流水生产后，一台机械坏了，却可以使整个“龙”上的几道、十几道工序同时停下来。因此，及时发动群众学习和掌握机械修理技术，对一条“龙”的巩固、推广、提高就能发生十分显著的作用。实现自动半自动生产流水线以后，对材料和包装材料的规格要求也更严格了。不同规格的型钢不能同时在一条轧钢流水线上进行生产，不同大小的安瓿不能同时在一条针剂生产流水线上生产，不同纸质的纸坯和纸盒不能同时在制盒生产自动线和牙膏包装机上生产，等等。因此，就要求加强原材料管理和原材料的进厂质量检验工作。
    企业管理工作的改进和加强，还可以有力地促进技术革新项目的发展、提高。上海化学工业社牙膏生产一条“龙”开始投入生产后，由于机械设备存在缺陷，牙膏帽拧在牙膏管上的百分率很低，他们在机械拧牙膏帽这道工序上建立了牙膏帽消耗定额制度，工人们很关心机械拧上的牙膏管百分比率是多少。比率低了，工人就要仔细观察鉴定，分析机械缺陷，研究改进；比率高了，工人也仔细观察鉴定，总结经验，这样，不断观察鉴定，不断研究改进，现在机械拧上的牙膏管比率已在80％以上。
    这些经验证明，生产关系必须适合生产力的发展。技术革新和技术革命发展了生产力，生产力发展到一定程度，就需要调整企业管理的方式和劳动组织，否则就会不利于生产力的继续发展。当然，调整企业管理的方式和劳动组织，只是改变生产关系中的某些环节。生产关系具有相对的稳定性，这种稳定在一定范围内对于发展生产力也是必要的。
    领导干部满腔热情地对待革新项目，发扬踏踏实实、深入细致的工作作风，是保证技术革新项目巩固、推广、提高的主要关键。这是最后一条，也是最重要的一条。
    领导干部对待群众创造的革新成就，特别是技术上还有某些缺陷的革新项目，首先必须采取满腔热情、积极支持的态度。如果对一时在生产上还不能显示巨大效果的革新项目采取冷淡的态度，不去发动群众加以鉴定、总结，不断加以研究、改进，甚至拆掉了事，当然就不能使暂时还不完善、不成熟的革新项目迅速成长起来。华生制盒厂制盒生产一条“龙”，刚建成时，因为不完善、不成熟，时停时开，不能正常使用。当时厂里有些领导同志怀疑工人做的木头机器不顶事，动过“一刀砍掉”的念头。如果当时砍掉，就不会有现在生产提高一倍半的成果。后来，由于他们学习了《马克思主义者怎样对待新生事物》的文章，提高了认识，增强了信心，向群众检查了自己的错误想法，深入生产第一线，同群众一起分析关键，一起围攻关键，结果仅四天时间就巩固、推广了革新成就。这就说明，领导上对待新生事物的思想认识和采取的态度，对支持群众的革新创造精神，对革新项目的巩固、推广、提高，起着多么重要的作用。
    在技术革新项目的巩固、推广、提高工作过程中，领导干部还必须脚踏实地、深入细致地做许多具体的思想工作和组织工作。联华带钢厂“七天革个命”搞成了带钢生产自动流水线以后，因为经常发生事故停车，部分群众就有些泄气，却看不到自己大搞技术革命的巨大成就。因此，当时这个厂面临的任务就是既要过好技术关，又要帮助群众提高认识，把革新技术的积极性充分调动起来。但在开始的时候，这个厂的党支部书记没有坚持发扬今年年初同群众同甘苦的优良作风，主观地认为事故是工人操作不当心而造成的，一味批评、责备工人。这样就使工人的积极性受到了影响，技术关键很久得不到解决。后来，支部书记改进了作风，深入生产第一线，同群众同劳动、同商量，才发现了发生事故的原因，经过发动群众改进了机件，从此再未发生事故，生产水平也迅速提高了。技术革命成就在生产上显示了它的优越性，群众的思想也提高了，革新创造的积极性进一步充分地调动了起来。
    现在，这十二家工厂对今后进一步巩固、推广、提高十二条“龙”的革新成就，都有了初步规划。前一时期曾经把一条“龙”拆掉的合成五金厂和上海录音器材厂，已重新把“龙”安装起来。上海录音器材厂对录音机自动校验流水线也准备在重新建立起来以后，组织力量进一步加以鉴定、总结、研究、改进。这十二家工厂都将根据生产发展的要求，使十二条“龙”精益求精，不断提高自动化程度，不断提高生产能力，并且在其他各个生产环节上普遍地大搞革新项目的巩固、推广、提高工作，推动技术革命的车轮不断滚滚向前，保证生产持续跃进。
