U.S. Neo-Colonialism Threatens the African People
(South Africa) Bila

　　It is necessary to constantly explain and expose to the broadest working masses of all countries, especially backward countries, the deceptive policies consistently pursued by the imperialist powers, who, under the guise of establishing politically independent states, create states that are completely dependent on them economically, financially, and militarily. —Lenin: "Draft Theses on National and Colonial Questions"

　　Shortly after the South African police massacre of peaceful demonstrators in Sharpeville and Langa, the U.S. State Department issued a statement expressing "regret" over the atrocity and the deaths.

　　This statement is intriguing because it was issued just five months after a radio address by the U.S. Ambassador to South Africa, Philip Crowe. In the broadcast, Philip stated that "the United States and the South African government are partners in Africa," which indicates that the United States and the South African authorities are aligned in their bloody suppression of the people.

　　How do we explain these seemingly contradictory statements?

　　Two-Faced Policy

　　In fact, the United States is pursuing a conspiratorial policy in Africa. On the one hand, the United States pretends to be a "friend" of all African countries, expressing "sympathy" and "understanding" for the African people's demands for freedom and independence. On the other hand, it actively supports the old colonial powers and white minority immigrants in their suppression of the people.

　　U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Joseph C. Satterthwaite admitted in a speech before a congressional committee this March that the United States should control the direction of development of African countries. In his mind, there is a plan to promote U.S. neo-colonialism by greatly increasing economic, military, and cultural "aid." According to this spokesman for U.S. imperialism, it is necessary to make the strong tide of nationalism conform to "an orderly way of transition from the past to the future."

　　The United States learned from the failure to prevent the liberation movements carried out by the Asian people after the war. Therefore, it supports the view: "...the correct approach for the West is not to retreat or 'get out,' but to find satisfactory ways to stay" (Stahler-Sholk and Hazard: *Colonialism Thoughts*, pp. 42-43, New York, 1958).

　　Aid with Shackles

　　Satterthwaite said: The United States' current "aid" program to Africa "is not sufficient in scale or quantity to adapt to the remarkable changes taking place (in Africa)." He requested that "aid" to Africa be increased to $157.5 million in the (U.S.) 1961 fiscal year.

　　One of the main purposes of U.S. "aid" to Africa is to turn Africa into an appendage providing raw materials for its military economy. The 1956 *Wall Street Business Almanac* magazine wrote to incite the greedy desires of U.S. corporations: "Africa is...the world's largest untapped treasure trove of natural resources."

　　The long-term struggle by European powers to control these mythical resources has led to the division and colonization of most of the African continent. The development of national liberation movements has already opened a large gap in the colonial system in Africa. However, the African people are now facing a new and most dangerous threat, namely the threat of U.S. neo-colonialism.

　　John Gunther, the author of "Inside Africa," wrote: "This legendary and formidable continent is extremely important to the Western world, not only because it is strategically important and full of extremely important raw materials, but also because it is our last line of defense. A large part of Asia has already been lost, and only Africa remains. Africa is like a vacuum, wide open...it is the most precious target of contention on earth." Africa has thus become a "treasure" coveted by U.S. monopoly companies.

　　The goal of U.S. imperialism is to ultimately expel the old-line imperialists and gain exclusive control over Africa. Currently, U.S. imperialism is infiltrating Africa economically, politically, and militarily.

　　Economic Penetration

　　The economic penetration of the United States (into Africa) takes a form that is considered very good. The United States attempts to appear as a benefactor of the African people by bestowing "aid." In reality, the United States is trying to maximize the expansion of monopolies with the least amount of government capital expenditure. "U.S. aid" is not directly used to serve the African people, but serves the economic, financial, and military interests of U.S. imperialists. "U.S. aid" labeled "strategic and basic materials" is only used directly to finance strategic raw materials for military purposes.

　　Money obtained from the "Overseas Development Fund" is also largely used to build railways, strategically important highways, ports, and airports, which are indispensable for U.S. corporations to obtain super profits and are also needed for its military purposes.

　　The "Technical Cooperation" fund has been used to conduct a geological survey of Africa (thereby discovering its mineral resources) and to train Africans who are essential to the Americans. The "Development Assistance" fund, another form of "U.S. aid," is used to finance certain so-called African economic sectors. The United States has a special interest in these sectors, and these sectors will only push African countries towards economic subservience to the United States as a raw material supply base. As for the "aid" provided to North African countries, special emphasis is placed on using it to build strategically important airports and seaports.

　　In the first stage of U.S. economic penetration into certain African countries, U.S. diplomats, banks, and other institutions conduct a thorough survey of the country's economy and prospects, and then formulate a general plan. The local government that accepts "U.S. aid" is then responsible for managing basic services, such as railways, seaports, and transportation, according to this plan. In some cases, the World Bank and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which are controlled by the United States, also inject large amounts of capital into the country to facilitate the progress of the initial stage of U.S. penetration.

　　This paves the way for U.S. manufacturers to make direct investments to establish their own factories or agencies. The United States also buys shares in the companies being opened.

　　Large Influx of Capital

　　U.S. direct investment has spread throughout Africa. However, its most important investments are still in South Africa and Central Africa, because these regions are good suppliers of some raw materials that the West urgently needs, such as uranium, gold, cobalt, and copper ore.

　　Let's take South Africa first—because it has the largest and most important amount of U.S. capital. According to official figures, the face value of U.S. assets in South Africa was less than 90 million U.S. dollars in 1943. By 1950, U.S. direct investment (in South Africa) had almost tripled. In the following two years, the total value of U.S. investment in South Africa increased by another 50 million U.S. dollars. Since then, U.S. investment in the mining, manufacturing, and petroleum industries has grown significantly.

　　The profits that the United States has obtained in South Africa are so large that the United States has more U.S. dollars in South Africa than in the Philippines, or more than the sum of U.S. dollars in Italy, Belgium, and Turkey. According to the U.S. Ambassador to South Africa last October, U.S. investment in South African industry totaled 200 million pounds.

　　Liberia is second in importance only to South Africa, and the United States has always had very close ties with it. The United States' main interests there are in mining and commerce. After Liberia, the next most important is the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. In 1952, U.S. direct investment there reached 26 million U.S. dollars. In the following two years, the total investment increased to 43 million U.S. dollars. The United States also directly invests in the traditional British "spheres of influence" along the west coast, such as Ghana, Nigeria, and similarly, the United States has investment in Ethiopia.

　　From 1951 to 1958, the United States obtained annual profits as high as 21-25% from its more than 2 billion U.S. dollars of private investment in Africa.

　　Diplomats and Generals Are Also Very Busy

　　Politically, U.S. big industrial capitalists are making full use of their embassies, legations, and consulates to promote their expansion plans.

　　The Cairo African Association's Kenya Bureau had to accuse some Americans of "suggesting ideas" behind the scenes to some Kenyan representatives who attended the recent constitutional round table conference in London. The Kenyan authorities pointed out that it is very obvious that the Americans' purpose is to divide the African ranks and tempt African representatives to betray their national demands.

　　Other "Cold War" institutions, such as the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, have been painstakingly spreading anti-communist ideas in Africa in an attempt to split the working-class movement.

　　Militarily, the United States is spending large amounts of government funds to militarize the African continent under the pretext of strengthening the "security" of the United States and its Atlantic Treaty allies. *U.S. News & World Report* magazine once said: "You only need to take a short, hurried trip to Africa to be deeply impressed by the importance of Africa to the U.S. defense plan." U.S. imperialists fantasize about using Africa, with its human and natural resources, as a bridgehead to launch aggression against socialist countries and independent countries that oppose U.S. conspiracies.

　　The United States is spending large sums of money to build military and naval bases. The U.S. "aid" for the 1961 fiscal year will focus on Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia because the United States has special military interests in these countries. Since South Africa produces more uranium than the United States and Canada combined, South Africa is of vital military importance to the United States.

　　The evidence is clear. The U.S. statement on Sharpeville is by no means "accidental," and it is by no means a sincere message of sympathy and support for the oppressed people of South Africa. U.S. monopoly capital has its investments in racial segregation and the continuation of the brutal exploitation of the working people.

　　In order to more effectively penetrate affiliated countries and colonies, the United States has deliberately adopted a policy of playing with the slogan of "anti-colonialism" as a preparatory condition for the expansion of U.S. monopoly companies in Africa. It is using this "anti-colonialism" to force Western colonial countries to make important concessions to the United States. Even Michel Debré, a proponent of so-called Franco-American "solidarity," had to admit: "U.S. anti-colonialism actually serves to cover up the very despicable interests of (U.S.) dynamic corporations."

　　This analysis of U.S. policy proves that behind these conspiracies lies a deliberate purpose: to permanently maintain Africa's colonial status, exploit and plunder its people, and turn Africa into a base for aggression.

    美国新殖民主义威胁着非洲人民
    （南非）比拉
    必须向一切国家、特别是落后国家的最广大的劳动群众不断地说明和揭露帝国主义列强一贯实行的欺骗政策，帝国主义列强打着建立政治上独立的国家的幌子，来建立在经济、财政和军事方面都完全依赖于它们的国家。　——列宁：《民族和殖民地问题提纲初稿》
    在南非警察对沙佩维尔和兰加地区的和平示威者进行屠杀的事件发生后不久，美国国务院曾经发表了一个声明，对这次暴行和死难表示“遗憾”。
    这个声明耐人寻味，因为它是在美国驻南非大使菲立浦·克劳发表广播演说仅仅五个月后发表的。菲立浦在广播中说：“美国和南非政府在非洲是合伙者”，这就表明了美国和南非当局在对人民进行血腥镇压这个方面是一致的。
    我们如何来解释这些显然矛盾的声明呢？
    两面政策
    事实上，美国在非洲正执行着一个阴谋政策。美国一方面假装是所有非洲国家的“朋友”，对非洲人民争取自由和独立的要求表示“同情”和“谅解”，另一方面，它又积极支持老牌殖民国家和少数白种移民对人民实行镇压。
    美国非洲事务助理国务卿约瑟夫·西·萨脱斯威特今年3月在国会委员会上的演说便供认美国应该控制非洲各国的发展方向。在他的心目中，存在着一个用大量增加经济的、军事的和文化的“援助”来推行美国新殖民主义的计划。根据这个美帝国主义代言人的说法，那就是：有必要使坚强的民族主义浪潮顺从于“有秩序地从过去向未来过渡的方式”。
  美国从阻止亚洲人民在战后所进行的解放运动的失败中得到了教训。因此它支持这样一种观点：“……西方正确的方针不是退却或‘滚蛋’，而是去寻找令人满意的办法，以便留下来”（斯托士—希博和哈撒德合著：《殖民主义思想》第42—43页。1958年，纽约）。
    附有枷锁的援助
    萨脱斯威特说：美国目前对非洲的“援助”计划“在规模上或数量上都不足以适应（非洲）正在发生的令人注目的变化”。他要求在（美国）1961财政年度中把对非洲的“援助”增至一亿五千七百五十万美元。
    美国对非洲的“援助”的主要目的之一，是把非洲变成为它的军事经济提供原料的附属地。1956年的《华尔街商业年鉴》杂志就曾为煽动美国大公司的贪婪愿望而写道：“非洲是……世界上最大的未经开发的自然资源宝库。”
    欧洲列强为着控制这些神话般的资源而进行的长期争夺，使得非洲大陆的大部分被分割和殖民地化了。民族解放运动的发展已经在非洲的殖民制度中打开了一个大缺口。但是，非洲人民现在又面临着一个新的和最危险的威胁，即美国新殖民主义的威胁。
    “非洲内幕”的作者约翰·根室写道：“这个传奇般的令人不敢等闲视之的大陆对西方世界极其重要，不仅因为它在战略上是重要的，充满了极其重要的原料，而且因为它是我们最后的防线。亚洲很大部分已经丧失，仅非洲还存留着。非洲像一个真空地带一样，大门洞开……它是地球上最珍贵的争夺目标。”非洲，就这样成为美国垄断公司垂涎的“珍品”了。
    美帝国主义的目标是要最终地驱逐老牌帝国主义而取得对非洲的独霸权利。目前，美帝国主义正在经济上、政治上和军事上渗入非洲。
    经济渗透
    美国在经济上（对非洲）的浸透采取了一种被认为是很好的方式。美国企图通过赐给“援助”而以非洲人民的恩人的面目出现。实际上，美国却试图以支出最少的政府资本来达到最大限度的扩张垄断的目的。“美援”并不直接用来为非洲人民服务，而是服务于美国帝国主义分子经济的、财政的和军事的利益。标上“战略和基本物资”字样的“美援”只是直接用来为谋取军事目的的战略原料而提供资金的。
    从“海外发展基金”中取得的金钱也都被大量地用来修建铁路、有战略意义的公路、港口和飞机场，这些对美国大公司获取超额利润是不可缺少的，也是它的军事目的所需要的。
  “技术合作”基金已被用来对非洲进行一次地质调查（从而发现它的矿产资源），和用来训练对美国人说来十分必要的非洲人。作为另一项“美援”的“开发援助”基金，则是用来为某些所谓的非洲经济部门提供资金。在这些部门中，有着美国的特殊利益；而且，这些部门只会把非洲国家推向美国经济的从属地位，作为原料供应基地。至于为北非各国提供的“援助”，人们特别强调要用来修建有战略意义的飞机场和海港。
    在美国对某些非洲国家进行经济渗透的第一阶段，美国的外交官、银行以及其他机构就对这个国家的经济和前景作了彻底的调查，然后订出一个大体上的计划。接受“美援”的当地政府再根据这个计划来负责管理基本的服务事业，如铁路、海港和交通运输等等。在有些情况下，由美国控制的世界银行和国际建设和开发银行也把大量资财输入这个国家，以有利于美国渗透的初级阶段的进展。
    这些就给美国制造商来建立他们自己的工厂或代理机构而进行直接投资的阶段扫清了道路。美国同时也在开设的公司中买进股票。
    资本的大量输入
    美国的直接投资已遍及全非洲。但是它的最重要的投资仍在南非和中非，因为这些地区是西方迫切需要的一些原料如铀、黄金、钴石和铜矿石的良好的供应者。
    先就南非来说吧——因为这里的美国资本数量最多并且最重要。据官方数字估计，美国在南非的资产的票面价值1943年还不到九千万美元，到1950年，美国（在南非）的直接投资几乎已增加了三倍。以后两年中，美国在南非的投资总值又增加了五千万美元。从那时起，美国在采矿业、制造业和石油业的投资便大大增长了。
    美国在南非取得的利润是如此之多，因此美国在南非的美元已多于菲律宾，或者说比在意大利、比利时和土耳其的美元的总和还多。据美国驻南非大使去年10月透露，美国在南非工业中的投资共计有两亿英镑之多。
    利比里亚的重要性仅次于南非，美国与它的联系一向是非常紧密的。美国在那里的主要利益是在采矿业和商业中。次于利比里亚的，是罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰联邦。1952年，美国在那里的直接投资已达二千六百万美元。在以后两年中，投资总额又增为四千三百万美元。美国还直接投资于沿着西海岸的传统的英国“势力范围”，如加纳、尼日利亚，同样在埃塞俄比亚也有美国的投资。
    在1951年到1958年期间，美国从它在非洲的二十多亿美元的私人投资中每年所取得的利润高达21—25％。
    外交官和将军们也十分忙碌
    政治上，美国的大工业资本家正在充分利用它的大使馆、公使馆和领事馆来推行他们的扩张计划。
    开罗非洲人协会怯尼亚局曾不得不指责一些美国人在幕后给某些参加最近在伦敦召开的制宪圆桌会议的怯尼亚代表“出主意”。怯尼亚当局指出：十分明显，美国人的目的是要分裂非洲人的队伍，并诱惑非洲代表背叛他们的民族要求。
    其他“冷战”机构，如国际自由工联已在非洲辛辛苦苦地散布了反共产主义的思想，企图以此来分裂工人阶级的运动。
    在军事上，美国正打着加强美国及其大西洋公约盟国的“安全”的幌子，花费大量政府基金来把非洲大陆军事化。美国《新闻与世界报道》杂志曾说：“你只要到非洲去作一次短期的匆匆旅行，就会对非洲对美国的防御计划的重要性产生深刻的印象”。美国帝国主义分子妄想把拥有人力和自然资源的非洲用来作为对社会主义国家和对那些反对美国阴谋的独立国家发动侵略的桥头堡。
    美国正花费着大量金钱来建造军事和海军基地。美国1961财政年度的“美援”就将把重点放在利比亚、摩洛哥和突尼斯，因为美国在这些国家中有着特殊的军事利益。由于南非出产的铀比美国和加拿大出产的总和还多，因此南非对美国有着非常重要的军事意义。
    证据是明显的。美国关于沙佩维尔的声明，决不是“偶然的”，它决不是给南非被压迫人民以同情和支持的真诚的咨文。在种族隔离和延续对劳动人民的残酷剥削中，美国垄断资本是有着它的投资的。
    为了更有效地渗入附属国和殖民地，美国处心积虑地采取了一种玩弄“反殖民主义”口号的政策，以此作为美国垄断公司在非洲进行扩张的准备条件。它正在利用这种“反殖民主义”来迫使西方殖民国家对美国作出重要的让步。就连所谓法一美“团结”的鼓吹者米歇尔·德勃雷也不得不承认：“美国的反殖民主义实际上是为掩盖（美国）动力公司的十分卑鄙的利益服务的”。
    对美国政策的这个分析，证明了在这些阴谋的背后隐藏着一个处心积虑的目的：那就是永远维持非洲的殖民地地位，剥削和掠夺它的人民，并使非洲变成一个侵略基地。
