Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch from Tokyo: Prominent figures in Japanese society have emphasized the significance of the joint communiqué issued by representatives of the Chinese and Cuban governments and the signing of the economic cooperation agreement.

Japanese journalist and expert on Cuban affairs, Kan Toku Ikegami, pointed out that the joint communiqué issued by Chinese Vice Premier Li Xiannian and Cuban Revolutionary Government Economic Delegation Leader Guevara, as well as the signing of the economic cooperation agreement, will greatly encourage the Cuban people and the people of Latin America who are engaged in an uncompromising struggle against U.S. imperialism.

He pointed out that the Cuban people and government are engaged in economic construction under various forms of oppression and intimidation by the United States, and they are looking forward to selfless assistance. At this time, the governments of China and Cuba signed an economic cooperation agreement and a trade protocol, which is a precious gift from the Chinese people to the Cuban people, and it will play a beneficial role in helping Cuba's economic construction and the greater victory of the Cuban revolution.

Kenjiro Yanagida, a leader of the Japan Peace Committee, emphasized that this event once again proves the great role China plays in uniting oppressed peoples to launch a struggle against U.S. imperialism. At the same time, it proves that the selfless assistance of socialist countries is fundamentally different from the so-called "aid" of capitalist countries. Yanagida pointed out that this will have a great impact not only on the Cuban people but also on the people of other Latin American countries, and will further promote the common struggle of the people of all countries against U.S. imperialism.

    日本社会著名人士评中古联合公报和经济合作协定
    中古经济合作鼓舞了拉丁美洲人民
    新华社1日讯　东京消息：日本社会著名人士强调中国和古巴政府代表发表联合公报和签订经济合作协定的重要意义。
    日本著名记者、古巴问题专家池上干德指出，中国国务院副总理李先念同古巴革命政府经济代表团团长格瓦拉发表联合公报和签订经济合作协定，这将对正在同美帝国主义进行不妥协的斗争的古巴人民和拉丁美洲人民给予莫大的鼓舞。
    他指出，古巴人民和政府在美国各种压迫和恫吓下进行着经济建设，他们盼望无私的援助。在这个时候，中古两国政府签订了经济合作协定和贸易议定书，这是中国人民给予古巴人民的珍贵的礼物，它将在帮助古巴经济建设和古巴革命取得更大胜利方面起有益作用。
    日本和平委员会领导人柳田谦十郎强调说，这件事情又一次证明了中国在团结受压迫人民展开反对美帝国主义的斗争方面所起的伟大作用，同时证明，社会主义国家的无私援助在本质上与资本主义国家的所谓“援助”完全不同。柳田指出，这不仅对古巴人民而且对其他拉丁美洲各国人民将产生很大影响，并将促使各国人民反对美帝国主义的共同斗争进一步高涨。
