    Old Hero Tian Huapei Achieves New Merit in Vigorously Developing Agriculture
    Qinghai Cadres Take Him as an Example and Go to the Front Lines
    (Our Newspaper News) The vast number of cadres and workers in the industrial, transportation, and capital construction departments of Qinghai Province, fully demonstrating the spirit of hard struggle of Nanniwan in the Yan'an era, have launched a mass movement to learn from, catch up with, and surpass Tian Huapei, further promoting a new upsurge in offices vigorously developing agriculture and grain production.
  Fifty-one-year-old Tian Huapei is the deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Highway Engineering Bureau. He joined the Red Army thirty years ago and participated in the Long March; during the large-scale production movement of the troops in the Yan'an era, he was selected as a labor hero. This spring, when the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the call to vigorously develop office farms, the Party Committee of the Highway Engineering Bureau decided to establish an office farm on the Gangcha Grassland by Qinghai Lake. Following the instructions of the Bureau's Party Committee, he led a group of cadres and workers to the Gangcha Grassland to run the farm, overcoming numerous difficulties and completing the tasks of land reclamation, farm construction, sowing, field management, and harvesting. His exemplary actions played a positive role in promoting the movement throughout the province, especially in the industrial and transportation systems. After the autumn harvest, when the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a call to the whole province to further vigorously develop office farms, the vast number of cadres and workers in the industrial and transportation systems further launched a movement to learn from, catch up with, and surpass Tian Huapei, demanding to become advanced figures like Tian Huapei in vigorously developing agriculture and applying to participate in agricultural production. Cadres and workers' families also requested to move to the office farms to settle down. In the Highway Engineering Bureau, where Tian Huapei works, Zhang Jinlan, a family member of a worker and a Communist Party member, applied five times to go to the office farm.
    Currently, in the Qinghai Provincial Department of Transportation and its subordinate units alone, more than six thousand six hundred cadres, workers, and their families have arrived at various units' office farms to participate in agricultural production. Xu Xianzhang, Deputy Director and Party Secretary of the Department of Transportation, and leading comrades from various bureaus and factories, have gone deep into the office farms, eating, living, and working together with the farm's cadres and workers, consulting with the masses on all matters, grasping both production and life, arranging labor, and innovating tools, greatly encouraging the farm workers' enthusiasm for labor.
    In the upsurge of vigorously developing office farms, Comrade Tian Huapei, who is highly respected and loved by the masses, after successfully completing the autumn harvest of the Gangcha Farm, led a group of cadres and workers to Tongde County in the Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in September, building a new office farm on a thousand-year-old dormant grassland. The day after arriving, he led the workers to declare war on the grassland, reclaiming more than five thousand mu of land in less than a month. In this new office farm, the workers launched a labor competition to "be Tian Huapei-style pacesetters," and a new scene of catching up with each other emerged in production. A women's production team composed of thirty family members of cadres, unafraid of difficulties and full of energy, quickly mastered land reclamation techniques, increasing their daily output from one fen per person to more than three fen, becoming a red flag team for the whole farm.
    In order to improve office production, the various units of the industrial and transportation systems of Qinghai Province are, in the spirit of "increasing production without increasing personnel, and increasing production while reducing personnel," drawing out more labor to support the office farms through vigorously engaging in technical revolution, improving enterprise management, and adjusting labor organization. Batch after batch of cadres and workers are rushing to the front lines of agricultural production. They are determined to take Comrade Tian Huapei as an example and make contributions in vigorously developing agriculture and grain production.

    老英雄田华培在大办农业中再立功
    青海干部以他为榜样纷赴第一线
    本报讯　青海省工业、交通运输和基本建设部门的广大机关干部和职工，充分发挥延安时代南泥湾的艰苦奋斗精神，掀起了学、赶、超田华培的群众运动，进一步推动了机关大办农业、大办粮食的新高潮。
  五十一岁的田华培，是青海省公路工程局的副局长。三十年前参加红军，经过二万五千里长征；在延安时代部队大生产运动中，他曾经被选为劳动英雄。今年春天，当中共青海省委发出大办机关农场的号召以后，公路工程局党委决定在青海湖畔的刚察草原建立机关农场，他又根据局党委指示，率领一部分干部职工赶到刚察草原办农场，克服了重重困难，完成了开荒、建场和播种、田间管理、收割任务。他的模范行动，在全省特别是工业和交通运输系统，起了积极的推动作用。当秋收完毕，中共青海省委向全省发出进一步大办机关农场的号召时，工业和交通运输系统的广大干部、职工，进一步掀起了学、赶、超田华培的运动，要求作田华培式的大办农业的先进人物，申请参加农业生产。干部和职工家属也纷纷要求搬到机关农场去安家落户。在田华培同志所在的公路工程局，职工家属、共产党员张金兰，五次申请要求去机关农场。
    现在，仅青海省交通厅及所属单位，先后已有六千六百多名干部、职工和家属，到达各单位的机关农场参加农业生产。交通厅的副厅长、党组书记徐宪章和各局、各厂的领导同志，都深入到机关农场，同农场的干部、职工同吃、同住、同劳动、遇事同群众商量，既抓生产，又抓生活，既抓劳动力安排，又抓工具革新，大大鼓舞了农场人员的劳动热情。
    在大办机关农场的热潮中，倍受群众尊敬和爱戴的田华培同志，在胜利完成了刚察农场的秋收任务以后，又于9月带领一部分干部、职工到果洛藏族自治州同德县，在一片千年沉睡的草原上兴建起新的机关农场。他在到达的第二天，就率领职工向草原宣战，在不到一个月的时间内，就开荒五千多亩。这个新的机关农场里，职工们开展了“作田华培式的标兵”的劳动竞赛，生产上出现了你追我赶的新景象。由三十名干部家属组成的妇女生产小队，不怕困难，干劲十足，很快掌握了开荒技术，由开始时每人每日开生荒一分提高到三分以上，成为全场的红旗小队。
    为了把机关生产搞得更好，青海省工业和交通运输系统的各单位，正在本着“增产不增人，增产又减人”的精神，通过大闹技术革命、改进企业管理、调整劳动组织的途径，抽调出更多劳动力增援机关农场，一批又一批的干部和职工，正纷纷奔赴农业生产前线。他们决心以田华培同志为榜样，在大办农业、大办粮食中立功。
