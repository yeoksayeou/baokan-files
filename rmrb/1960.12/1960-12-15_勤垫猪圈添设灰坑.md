    Diligently Pad Pigsties and Add Ash Pits
    While vigorously promoting collective manure accumulation, the Leijiabao Production Team of the Shatangchuan People's Commune in Huzhu Tu Autonomous County, Qinghai Province, also actively leads its members in carrying out household manure accumulation. Household manure accumulation by members is an important source of fertilizer. The leading cadres of the production team first explained to the members the principle of "grasping fertilizer first to achieve a great leap in grain production," and called on every household to accumulate fertilizer. Then, they helped the members to formulate fertilizer accumulation plans and broaden the sources of fertilizer. There are many ways for members' families to accumulate fertilizer, such as managing toilets well, diligently padding pigsties, adding ash pits, and picking up scattered manure, etc. With the help of the production team, the entire team implemented separate pit management of manure and ash, and every household used stove fire to smoke the soil. In order to make it convenient for members to use soil, the production team also specially allocated three donkey carts to haul padding soil and soil for fertilizer smoking. On the basis of the implementation of the fertilizer accumulation plan, the production team signed fertilizer purchase contracts with the members. The members expressed that they must overfulfill the fertilizer accumulation task. Now the entire team has accumulated 16.5 million catties of fertilizer, of which household manure accumulation by members accounts for 42 percent.

    勤垫猪圈添设灰坑
    青海互助土族自治县沙塘川公社雷家堡生产队在大搞集体积肥的同时，还积极领导社员开展家庭积肥。社员家庭积肥是肥料的重要来源之一，生产队的领导干部首先向社员讲了大办粮食先抓肥料的道理，号召家家户户都积肥。接着，就帮助社员制订积肥计划，广开肥源。社员家庭积肥的门路很多，如管好厕所、勤垫猪圈、添灰坑和零星拾粪等等。在生产队的帮助下，全队都实行了粪、灰分坑管理，家家利用灶火熏土。为了使社员用土方便，生产队还专拨了三辆驴车拉送垫脚土和熏肥用土。在积肥计划落实的基础上，生产队与社员订了购肥合同，社员表示一定要超额完成积肥任务，现在全队已积肥一千六百五十万斤，其中社员家庭积肥占百分之四十二。  刘之力
