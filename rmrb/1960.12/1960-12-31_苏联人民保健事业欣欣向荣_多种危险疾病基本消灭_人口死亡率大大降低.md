The People's Health Undertakings in the Soviet Union are Thriving
Many Dangerous Diseases Basically Eliminated　Population Mortality Rate Greatly Reduced
Americans Find it Difficult to See a Doctor When Sick
Thirty Million People Have No Medical Insurance
Cancer Patients Rank First in the World
Number of Mentally Ill Reaches 850,000

The Soviet Union's health undertakings have developed rapidly, presenting a scene of booming population. Currently, there are 380,000 doctors in the Soviet Union, accounting for one-third of the world's doctors, equal to half of the total number of doctors in Europe, and 15 times more than the total number of doctors in Russia before the revolution. The total output value of the pharmaceutical industry this year has increased to more than 13 times that of 1940.

Currently, there are 17.3 doctors and approximately 60 secondary medical workers for every 10,000 residents in the Soviet Union. In contrast, there are only 12 doctors per 10,000 residents in the United States, 10.3 in France, and 8.8 in the United Kingdom.

In the Soviet Union, everyone enjoys free medical care. The state attaches great importance to the development of medical education and scientific research. Currently, the Soviet Union has established 283 medical science research institutes, 80 higher medical colleges, and 11 advanced training colleges for physicians. In 1960, the number of people studying in higher medical colleges was 160,000, which is more than 30,000 more than the total number of students in all higher education institutions in Russia before the revolution.

Due to the efforts of Soviet medical workers and the improvement of living conditions, dangerous diseases such as cholera, plague, smallpox, and relapsing fever, which were widespread in Russia before the revolution, have now been completely eliminated. Diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria have been drastically reduced. The mortality rate of the Soviet population has decreased by three-quarters compared to before the revolution, 20% lower than the United States, and the infant mortality rate has decreased by about six-sevenths.

In the most developed capitalist country, the United States, the picture is completely different. According to the *New York Times*, due to the lack of organized national health institutions in the United States in 1959, 30 million Americans did not receive medical care, and the United States' plan to train medical personnel could only guarantee 6.4% of the required number. According to *Harper's Magazine*, the number of cancer patients in the United States ranks first in the world. At the beginning of 1959, there were 850,000 mental patients in the United States, with only 11,000 psychiatrists, while the actual number of doctors needed should be more than three times that number.

    苏联人民保健事业欣欣向荣
    多种危险疾病基本消灭　人口死亡率大大降低
    美国人有病就医难
    三千万人没有医疗保证
    癌病患者居世界第一位
    精神病人数达八十五万
    苏联保健事业发展迅速，呈现一片人口兴旺景象。目前苏联全国共有医生三十八万名，占全世界医生人数的三分之一，等于欧洲医生总数的一半，比革命前俄国医生总和增加了十五倍。今年医药工业总产值已增加为1940年的十三倍以上。
    现在苏联每一万个居民中就有十七点三名医生及约六十名中等医务工作者。而美国每一万居民中只有十二名医生，法国只有十点三名，英国只有八点八名。
    在苏联，每一个人都享受免费医疗。国家极重视医学教育和科学研究工作的发展。目前苏联已经建立了二百八十三所医学科学研究所，八十所高等医学院校，十一所医师进修学院。1960年在高等医学院校学习的人数为十六万人，这比革命前俄国全部高等学校学生的总和还要多三万多名。
    由于苏联医务工作者的努力和生活条件的改善，在革命前俄国广泛流行的霍乱、鼠疫、天花、回归热等危险疾病现在已被完全消灭。肺结核、疟疾等，已急剧减少。苏联人口的死亡率比革命前降低四分之三，比美国低20％，儿童死亡率降低约七分之六。
    而在资本主义最发达的国家——美国，完全是另外一幅景象。据《纽约时报》消息，美国1959年由于缺乏有组织的国家保健机构，三千万美国人得不到医疗，美国培养医务工作人员的计划只能保证所需培养人数的6.4％。又据美国《哈泼斯》杂志消息，美国的癌病患者居于世界第一位，美国1959年初共有精神病患者八十五万人，精神病医生只有一万一千名，而实际上所需要的医生人数应是这个数字的三倍以上。
