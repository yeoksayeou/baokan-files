Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 25th: The industrial departments of Yangzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, are closely focusing on the three major aspects of agricultural production: field operations, manure collection and application, and threshing on the threshing ground, to carry out a small and medium-sized farm tool supporting repair and manufacturing campaign.

The central requirements of this campaign are: field operation tools should have five pieces: large shovels, hoes, rakes, sickles, and seedling rakes; manure collection and application tools should have five pieces: manure forks, manure baskets, manure scoops, mud shovels, and shoulder poles; threshing ground tools should have six pieces: forks, rakes, brooms, shovels, baskets, and sieves. At the same time, each farm boat should be equipped with two punting poles, one fishing net, and one oar; each small cart should be equipped with one manure box and one ash basket; each waterwheel should be equipped with thirty paddles and ten awls; each head of draught cattle should be equipped with one plow, two sets of forehead yokes, and two sets of plowshares, and two cattle should be equipped with one harrow. This was proposed by the prefectural industrial departments after investigating farmers' opinions on farm tool supply, reviewing and summarizing past experiences in supporting agriculture, and conducting research with relevant departments in the beginning of the fourth quarter. The specific quantitative standards for the complete sets are determined based on the characteristics of different regions. For example, in miscellaneous grain areas, due to the large variety of crops and the large area of intercropping, the amount of weeding is large, so each laborer is required to have a hoe for the field operation tools such as shovel and hoe; while in water network areas, because only one crop is grown a year, it is required that each household has one on average.

The prefectural industrial departments and relevant departments held a collaboration meeting, arranged the raw materials and small and medium-sized farm tool repair and manufacturing tasks according to the requirements of complete sets, and implemented them to the repair and manufacturing units. At the same time, according to the characteristics of farm tools and the different quality requirements, the county, commune farm tool factories and the production brigade's farm tool repair stations made clear divisions of labor. For example, the repair and manufacturing of farm boats and the plowshares and plow ears used for cattle plow sets have relatively high technical and quality requirements, so they are all the responsibility of the county and commune farm tool factories; simple iron, wood, and bamboo farm tools are repaired and matched by the production brigade's farm tool repair stations. In order to strengthen the leadership of this work, a one-line special leadership organization was established from the prefecture and county to the commune and production brigade.

At present, the total number of small and medium-sized farm tools repaired and manufactured in the entire district has exceeded 1.2 million, and the small and medium-sized farm tools used for field operations and spring plowing and planting are basically complete sets. For example, more than 80% of the repair and manufacturing plan has been completed for the five types of tools used for field operations, such as hoes and rakes; the plows and harrows matched with cattle have exceeded the repair and manufacturing plan by 17%.

    扬州专区抓住修造农具的一个重要环节
    把耕作积肥收打工具配套齐全
    据新华社南京25日电　江苏省扬州专区工业部门紧紧围绕农业生产上的田间作业、积肥施肥、场头收打三大项目，开展中小农具配套修造运动。
    这个运动的中心要求是：田间作业工具，要求具有大锹、锄头、钉耙、镰刀、秧耙五件；积肥施肥工具，要求具有粪叉、粪箕、粪勺、戽锨、扁担五件；场头工具，要求具有叉、耙、扫帚、锨、箩、筛六件。同时，每条农船要配齐两篙、一罱、一桨；每辆小车要配齐一只粪箱、一只灰篮；每部水车要配齐三十片拂板、十只椎子；每头耕牛要配齐一部犁、两套额头、两套犁头，两头牛配上一部耙。这是专区工业部门在第四季度初，调查了农民对农具供应的意见，检查总结了以往支援农业的经验，并同有关部门研究以后提出来的。配套的具体数量标准，根据不同地区的特点来确定。如田间作业工具中的锹、锄，在杂谷地区，由于农作物品种多，套种幅度大，锄草量大，因而要求每个劳动力要有一把；而水网地区因一年只种一熟，则要求平均每户有一把。
    专区工业部门和有关部门召开了协作会议，根据成龙配套的要求，安排了原料材料和中小农具修造任务，落实到修造单位。同时，根据农具的特点和质量要求的不同，县、社农具厂和生产大队的农具修配站作了明确的分工。如农船修造和牛犁配套用的犁头、犁耳等，技术要求和质量要求都比较高，就都由县和公社农具厂负责修造配套；简易的铁木竹农具，则由生产大队的农具修配站修造和配套。为了加强对这项工作的领导，从专区、县到公社、生产大队，建立了一条线的专线领导组织。
    目前，全区中小农具的修造总数已经有一百二十多万件，田间作业和春耕春种用的中小农具基本上成龙配套。如田间作业用的锄头、钉耙等五种工具，完成了修造计划的80％以上；耕牛配套的犁和耙超额17％完成了修造计划。
