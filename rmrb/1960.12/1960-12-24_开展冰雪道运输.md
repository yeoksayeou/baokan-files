    Develop Ice and Snow Road Transportation
    *People's Daily* Commentator
    The winter solstice has arrived, and the severe cold season is here. In most parts of the northern provinces, rivers have been frozen for miles, and many places are covered with snow. This is a great season to develop ice and snow road transportation. All areas with suitable conditions in the northern provinces should seize the opportunity, and according to needs and possibilities, immediately, rapidly, and extensively develop ice and snow road transportation work.
    The vigorous development of the production increase and conservation movement centered on grain and steel urgently requires the transportation departments to provide a large amount of transport capacity to meet the needs of the current sustained development of the national economy. Especially on the short-distance transportation front, large quantities of grain need to be transferred to warehouses, various agricultural and sideline products purchased need to be transported in a timely manner, and raw materials for light and heavy industries such as coal, ore, cotton, and sugar beets, as well as the supply of the peak season market, have increased the volume of short-distance freight. What is the best way to complete such arduous transportation tasks while saving labor and transport capacity? The best way is to utilize all possible means of transport and modes of transport in accordance with local conditions and the timing.
    Ice and snow road transportation is originally a traditional folk transportation method in northern regions. Its main advantages are: low cost, less material, fuel-saving, easy to manufacture, and at the same time, it carries more than general folk transportation tools, and the method of use is simple, so it can be promoted quickly. In short, ice and snow road transportation is a mass transportation method that is economical, fast, good, and saves. According to the experience of Heilongjiang Province, a horse-drawn sled that can carry about two tons only costs more than 200 yuan to manufacture, is about twice as fast as an animal-powered vehicle, and can be used for two or three years. Last winter and this spring, more than 3 million tons of materials were transported through ice and snow roads in Heilongjiang Province. From this, it can be seen that fully utilizing the excellent natural conditions of ice and snow sealing roads in northern regions, and vigorously developing ice and snow road transportation, can not only transport a large amount of materials, but also save fuel, automobiles, animal power, and manpower. This is an effective measure to complete the current extremely heavy short-distance transportation tasks.
    No matter what we do, we must not seek appearance, but pay attention to effectiveness. Some ice transportation tools created by the masses look very simple, but they are very useful when used. The "earth sled" created by the people of Inner Mongolia is made of willow branches and twigs woven into baskets, mixed with cattle dung, horse dung, and mud, and pasted tightly to the bottom of the basket, watered and frozen. It is light and flexible, economical, and practical to drive on ice and snow roads or dirt roads. After thawing in the spring, it can also be used as fertilizer. Therefore, all ice transportation tools that can be made and used locally should be manufactured; all reform methods that can improve the efficiency of ice transportation tools should be adopted.
    Combining indigenous methods with foreign methods, using indigenous methods where possible, and using foreign methods where possible, is the long-term policy for developing transportation work, and traditional folk transportation tools and methods should never be underestimated. Of course, these tools also need to be gradually improved. Various ice transportation tools have been improved in recent years. The ice transportation tools created in some areas last winter and this spring, such as train towing, cable sliding, and animal power plus sails, have not only improved the efficiency of ice transportation, but also saved labor. Our task is to summarize and promote these advanced experiences, and to create more and better ice transportation tools in the ice and snow road transportation this winter and next spring, so that the efficiency of ice transportation will be further improved.
    Ice and snow road transportation is highly seasonal. In our northeast, north China, and northwest, there is roughly one month to four months of freezing season every year. During this period, whether it is short-distance handling or longer-distance transportation; whether there are rivers and lakes, or mountainous areas and forest areas; no matter what kind of cargo is transported, as long as there are natural ice and snow roads or places where artificial ice and snow roads can be created, a large amount of transport capacity can be obtained from ice and snow. We must seize the opportunity, make preparations, and make full use of the ice and snow to serve socialist construction. At present, ice and snow road transportation in Heilongjiang Province has been widely carried out, and 370,000 sleds of various types are running on hundreds of newly repaired ice and snow roads. Other areas in Northeast, North China, and Northwest China should also prepare sleds, repair ice roads, and organize manpower according to the local climate development, and develop ice and snow road transportation without missing the opportunity.

    开展冰雪道运输
    本报评论员
    时届冬至，严寒季节来临，北方各省大部分地区的河流，已经千里冰封，许多地方都铺满了积雪，正是开展冰雪道运输的大好季节。北方各省一切有条件的地区，应抓紧时机，根据需要和可能，立即迅速地广泛地开展冰雪道运输的工作。
    以粮钢为中心的增产节约运动的蓬勃开展，迫切要求交通运输部门提供大量的运输力量，以适应当前国民经济持续发展的需要。尤其在短途运输战线上，大量的粮食要调运入库，收购的各种农副产品要及时调运，煤炭、矿石、棉花、甜菜等各种轻、重工业原料，以及旺季市场的供应，都增加了短途运输货运量。用什么办法才能既完成这样繁重的运输任务，又节约劳动力和运输力呢？最好的办法，是把一切可能利用的运输工具和运输方式，都因地制宜、因时制宜地利用起来。
    冰雪道运输本来是北方地区一种传统的民间运输方式。它的主要优点是：成本低，用材少，省燃料，易制造，同时比一般民间运输工具载量多，使用方法简易，因而推广起来也快。总之，冰雪道运输是一种具有广泛群众性的多快好省的运输方式。根据黑龙江省的经验，一张载重二吨左右的马拉爬犁，只需二百多元制造费，速度比畜力车要快一倍左右，还可以使用两三年。去冬今春，黑龙江省有三百多万吨物资是通过冰雪道来运输的。由此可见，北方各地充分利用冰雪封道的大好自然条件，大搞冰雪道运输，既可大量运输物资，又可节约油料、汽车、畜力和人力，这是完成当前极为繁重的短途运输任务的一项有效措施。
    我们不论办什么事情，都要不图外表，讲究实效。群众创造的一些冰上运输工具看起来很简陋，用起来却很顶用。内蒙古人民创造的一种“土爬犁”，用柳条、树枝编成箩筐，将牛粪马粪和泥水混合，贴紧筐底，浇水结冰，不论在冰雪道或土路上行驶都很轻便灵活，经济适用。春天化冻后，还可用它作肥料。因此，凡是能够就地取材、就地使用的冰上运输工具，都应当制造；凡是能够提高冰上运输工具效率的改革办法，都应当采取。
    土洋结合，能土则土，能洋则洋，是发展交通运输工作的长远方针，绝不可轻视那些传统性的民间运输工具和方法。当然，这些工具，也是需要逐步改进的。各种冰上运输工具近年来已经有了改进。去冬今春一些地区创造的冰上运输工具，如列车拖挂、绞索滑溜、畜力加风帆等办法，既提高了冰上运输效率，又节约了劳动力。我们的任务是总结、推广这些先进经验，并且在今冬明春的冰雪道运输中，创造更多、更好的冰上运输工具，使冰上运输效率进一步提高。
    冰雪道运输具有很强的季节性。我国东北、华北和西北每年大体有一个月到四个月的冰冻季节。在这个期间，不论是短途搬运或较长途的运输；不论是有河流、湖泊的地方，还是山区、林区；不论是运输什么货种，只要有天然冰雪道或能够用人工创造冰雪道的地方，都能向冰雪索取到大量的运力。我们要抓紧时机，做好准备，充分利用冰天雪地为社会主义建设服务。目前，黑龙江省的冰雪道运输已经广泛开展起来了，三十七万张各式各样的爬犁正在几百条新整修的冰雪道上奔驰着。东北、华北、西北其他地区也应根据当地气候发展情况，备好爬犁，修好冰道，组织好人力，不失时机地把冰雪道运输开展起来。
