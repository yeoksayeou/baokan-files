    From Repairing Fountain Pens to Repairing Farm Tools
    Gong Fuhou is a service worker at the Comprehensive Service Department of the Oils and Fats Management Area of the Siping City Urban People's Commune in Jilin Province. He originally specialized in repairing fountain pens. However, in the movement of all trades and industries supporting agriculture, he became an expert in repairing farm tools. One day in the summer of this year, he led a few people as usual to Team 1 of the Qinyie Production Brigade in the suburbs to repair tools for the commune members. As soon as they arrived, they heard that the water pump at the pumping station here was broken, and after contacting the repair factory several times, they believed that it could not be repaired for the time being. The weather was getting drier day by day, and more than ten hectares of paddy fields urgently needed irrigation. Gong Fuhou thought: This is no small matter! So, he resolutely stated in front of the commune members: "I guarantee to help repair the water pump." Gong Fuhou immediately inspected the water pump with the workers of the miscellaneous repair team and used manual methods to make a wrought iron water reversing wheel, which he installed on the water pump and tried. It worked perfectly. However, upon closer inspection, it was found that a 5-fen reverse threaded screw was missing inside. He returned to the shop and discussed it with his comrades, but they couldn't think of a solution for a while. Gong Fuhou was restless with anxiety. Later, he consulted an old worker, who told him: "There are reverse threaded screws on bicycle pedals." This made him very happy. He quickly found an old bicycle and removed a 4-fen reverse threaded screw. A 4-fen screw was still unusable. He and his co-workers used a tap to make the 4-fen reverse threaded screw into a 5-fen one. Gong Fuhou took the fitted reverse threaded screw to the production team and immediately installed it. Unexpectedly, when installing the screw, another problem arose: it couldn't be tightened no matter how hard they tried. It turned out that the screw thread on the water pump had been worn smooth. Based on his experience in repairing fountain pens, Gong Fuhou found a small hacksaw and carefully carved the screw thread, stroke by stroke. He worked for four days straight, repairing the water pump. When he turned it on, the water flowed out gurglingly again.
    In this way, in order to support agricultural production, Gong Fuhou, starting from the beginning of last year, pushed a mobile service cart with four or five comrades, traveled all over the three production brigades in the suburbs, and diligently and enthusiastically repaired various farm tools for the commune members. Every time, they left early and returned late, which was deeply welcomed by the commune members. (Attached picture)

    从修钢笔到修农具
    巩福厚是吉林省四平市城市人民公社油脂化管理区综合服务部的服务员。他原来是专门修理钢笔的。但在各行各业支援农业的运动中，他却成了修理农具的行家。今年夏季的一天，他照例带领几个人到城郊勤业生产大队一小队为社员修理用具。刚到，就听说这里抽水站的水泵坏了，而且经过与修理厂多次联系，都认为暂时修不好了。天气一天比一天旱起来，十多公顷水田急需灌溉。巩福厚想：这可不是一件小事儿！于是，他在社员面前坚决表示：“我保证帮助把水泵修好”。巩福厚马上和杂修组的工人一起检查了水泵，用手工方法做了一个熟铁反水轮，安在水泵上一试，正好。可是又仔细一检查，里边还缺一个五分的反扣螺丝。他又回到店里和同志们合计，一时也没想出办法来。巩福厚急的坐立不安。后来，他去请教一位老工人，老工人告诉他说：“自行车脚蹬子上有反扣螺丝”。这可把他乐坏了，他连忙找来一台旧自行车，拆下一个四分的反扣螺丝。四分的还是用不上。他就和工友们用丝锥把四分的反扣螺丝做成五分的。巩福厚拿着套好的反扣螺丝到生产队去，连忙进行安装。没想到安螺丝的时候，又出了问题，怎么拧也拧不紧。原来是水泵上螺丝扣被磨秃了。巩福厚根据修理钢笔的经验，找来一把小钢锯，一下一下地刻螺丝扣。他连夜修了四天，把水泵弄好了，一开车，水又澕澕地流了出来。
    就这样，巩福厚为了支援农业生产，从去年年初开始，他和四、五个同志一起推着游动服务车，走遍了城郊三个生产大队，认真热情地为社员修理各种农具，每次都是早出晚归，深受社员们欢迎。（附图片）
