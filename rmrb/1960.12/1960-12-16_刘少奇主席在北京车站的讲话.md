Chairman Liu Shaoqi's Speech at Beijing Railway Station

Your Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Distinguished Cambodian Guests, Friends, Comrades:

Today, we feel extremely happy and honored that Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the distinguished Cambodian statesman, a respected friend of the Chinese people, and Head of State of Cambodia, is once again gracing our capital, Beijing, with his presence. On behalf of the Chinese people and the Government of the People's Republic of China, and in my personal capacity, I extend the warmest welcome to His Royal Highness the Prince, as well as to His Excellency Prince Penn Nouth, Vice-President of the High Council of the Throne of Cambodia, His Excellency Prime Minister Pho Proeung of the Royal Government of Cambodia, His Excellency Nhiek Tioulong, Deputy Prime Minister, and other distinguished guests who have come to visit our country along with His Royal Highness.

China and Cambodia are both peace-loving countries and close neighbors. The people of our two countries share a traditional and profound friendship and have always lived in harmony. We are very pleased to see that since the Chinese people achieved liberation and the Cambodian people achieved independence, the traditional friendship between the people of our two countries and the friendly relations of cooperation between the two countries have continued to develop on a new basis. This is the result of the joint efforts of the people and governments of our two countries, and it is also proof of the great vitality inherent in the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit. His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk has visited China twice, and each visit has brought the Chinese people the kinship-like friendship of the Cambodian people, making the relations between the two countries even closer. Your Royal Highness, I firmly believe that this visit to our country by Your Royal Highness and the distinguished Cambodian guests will definitely make new contributions to further strengthening the friendship between the people of the two countries and enhancing friendly cooperation between the two countries.

The Chinese people deeply admire the remarkable achievements made by the Cambodian people in their cause of striving for national prosperity and strength and defending national independence. We are pleased to see that the Royal Government of Cambodia, which has consistently pursued a policy of peace and neutrality, is playing an increasingly active role in international affairs, and is therefore increasingly supported and praised by peace-loving countries and peoples. The Chinese people are willing to further join hands with the Cambodian people and work closely together and support each other in the common cause of building our respective motherlands, defending national independence, and safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.

Long live the profound friendship between the people of China and Cambodia!

Long live the great unity of the people of Asia and the world!

Long live world peace!
