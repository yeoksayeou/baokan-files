The head of the delegation said: "In all these cities, we have seen the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great Chairman Mao, carrying out extraordinary labor for socialist construction.

"We admire your socialist construction very much. We have seen your glorious revolutionary past, and we have also seen your achievements in all aspects today."

José de Aguiar Dias said: "The development of heavy industry has made China's economy completely independent."

He visited a trial in a people's court. He said: "The defendant has full guarantee of defense. The verdict is very fair. Chinese legal workers have left a very good impression on me." He also praised China's marriage law as one of the best laws in the world.

He said that the delegation also saw the achievements of the Chinese government in enabling workers and peasants to receive cultural education. He praised the efforts of the Chinese people for the cause of peace.

When talking about the friendship between the Chinese and Brazilian people, José de Aguiar Dias said: "Brazilians think Brazil is very similar to China. We Brazilians think the Chinese people are our brothers. The friendly reception the delegation received in China proves that our idea is completely correct. We hope that Brazil can treat you in the same way."
