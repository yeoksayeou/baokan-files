    Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: The "Ten Thousand People Relay Advanced Experience Promotion Team," organized by the First Ministry of Machine Building, the National Committee of the China Machinery Trade Union, and the Mechanical Engineering Society, has conducted extensive activities in 1,677 factories across 23 provinces (autonomous regions) and 38 cities nationwide. This has enabled the nationwide blossoming and fruition of major new technologies, new processes, and new experiences emerging from the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the machinery industry.

    The "Ten Thousand People Relay Advanced Experience Promotion Team" organized by the machinery industry departments was established in August of this year, comprising 23 advanced experience promotion teams focused on large machine tools, small and medium-sized motors, hoisting and transport machinery, mining equipment, and industrial boilers, among other areas. Each promotion team was composed of personnel familiar with production, technology, management, and scientific research. Carrying sets of advanced experiences, they closely integrated with production during their promotional activities, targeting key technical problems and weak links in the production of the factories they visited. They promoted various effective new technologies, new processes, and new experiences, achieving significant results. For example, the multi-wire rope winches they promoted require over 1,000 fewer parts per unit compared to simple winding-type ordinary winches, saving two-thirds of the steel and more than 5,700 processing man-hours.

    The promotion teams helped many factories master the manufacturing technologies of new products, enabling 72 new products, such as cast iron commutator motors, tube-frame boilers, cement machine tools, triangular truss cranes, and high-speed grinding machines, to be put into production as early as possible. During their activities in various regions, the promotion teams promoted 1,449 advanced experiences and helped relevant factories solve 1,668 major production bottlenecks.

    The promotion teams also adopted a "mother hen leading chicks" approach, providing comprehensive guidance and training, to help various regions organize and cultivate 145 relay teams or seed teams. During their activities in various regions, the promotion teams coordinated and cooperated with these relay teams, jointly researching and performing demonstrations, enabling the relay team members to master the technical innovation experiences skillfully. Subsequently, these relay team members took the advanced experiences they had learned to other cities to continue promoting them, allowing the advanced experiences to blossom and bear fruit on a larger scale.

    To prepare for next year's production, the machinery industry departments organized another 14 relay advanced experience promotion teams in early November, which are now深入deeply involved in key factories across the country to continue promoting and exchanging experiences in technical innovation and technical revolution.

    “万人接力先进经验推广队”广泛传播先进种子
    机械业重大革新成果遍地开花
    据新华社12日讯　第一机械工业部、中国机械工会全国委员会和机械工程学会联合组织的“万人接力先进经验推广队”，在全国二十三个省（区）、三十八个城市、一千六百七十七个工厂的广泛活动，使机械工业技术革新和技术革命运动中出现的一些重大的新技术、新工艺、新经验在全国开花、结果。
    机械工业部门组织的“万人接力先进经验推广队”是今年8月间成立的，其中包括大型机床、中小型电机、起重运输机械、矿山设备、工业锅炉等方面先进经验推广队二十三个。每个推广队都是由熟悉生产、技术、管理、科学研究的各方面人员组成，他们带着成套的先进经验，在推广活动中，密切结合生产，针对所到工厂生产中的技术关键问题和薄弱环节，推广各种行之有效的新技术、新工艺、新经验，收到显著效果。例如，他们推广的多钢丝绳卷扬机，比单纯缠绕式普通卷扬机每台少一千多个零件，可以节省三分之二的钢材和五千七百多个加工工时。
    推广队帮助许多工厂掌握了新产品的制造技术，使铸铁片电动机、管架式锅炉、水泥机床、三角桁架起重机、高速磨矿机等七十二种新产品，及早投入生产。推广队在各地活动时，共推广先进经验一千四百四十九项，帮助有关工厂解决重大生产关键一千六百六十八项。
    推广队还采取“母鸡代小鸡”，包教包学的办法，帮助各地组织和培养了一百四十五个接力队或种子队。推广队在各地活动时都和这些接力队挂钩配合，共同研究、共同操作表演，使接力队的队员们熟练地掌握技术革新经验。而后，这些接力队员又把学到的先进经验带到其他城市继续推广，使先进经验在更大范围内开花结果。
    为了给明年生产做好准备，11月初机械工业部门又组织了十四个接力先进经验推广队，深入全国各地重点工厂，继续推广交流技术革新与技术革命的经验。
