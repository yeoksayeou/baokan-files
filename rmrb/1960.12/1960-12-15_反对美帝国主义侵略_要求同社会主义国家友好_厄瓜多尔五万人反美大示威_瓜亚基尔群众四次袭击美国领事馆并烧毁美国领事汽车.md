Xinhua News Agency, Guayaquil, December 12th: The Ecuadorian public's anti-American struggle continues to develop. Following a large anti-American demonstration by students in the capital, Quito, another massive anti-American demonstration involving 50,000 people broke out this afternoon in Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city.

The demonstration, initiated by the Law School Association of the University of Guayaquil, lasted for three hours, with students, workers, social groups, and people's organizations from the city of Guayaquil participating. During the demonstration, stores closed, factories took holidays, banks were not open for business, and all primary, secondary, and higher education institutions suspended classes. Demonstrators held tens of thousands of placards strongly condemning imperialism, the Organization of American States, and Pan-Americanism, and demanding the establishment of diplomatic and trade relations with socialist countries. The demonstrating masses continuously shouted slogans for Ecuador's national independence, demanding the expulsion of American institutions operating in Ecuador, such as the Point Four Program Cooperation Office.

The call for establishing relations and friendship with the socialist camp was very strong. There is a strong atmosphere of opposition to American imperialism throughout the country.

This morning, thousands of Guayaquil students were emotionally charged. They burned the car of the American Consul in the city, Ward Alan. The people angrily shouted, "Down with the Yankees!"

At the end of today's grand demonstration, the President of Ecuador, Velasco Ibarra, who was present, gave a speech. In his speech, Velasco vehemently criticized Pan-Americanism.

After the demonstration, groups of people attacked the American Consulate building and the business premises of the American monopoly organization, the Electric Power Company, for the fourth time with stones.
