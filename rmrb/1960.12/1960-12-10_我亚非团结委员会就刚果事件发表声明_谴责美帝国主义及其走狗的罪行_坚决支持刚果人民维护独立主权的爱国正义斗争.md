Xinhua News Agency, 9th: The Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee of China today issued a statement on the atrocities of U.S. imperialism and its stooges in persecuting Congolese Republic Prime Minister Lumumba. The full text of the statement is as follows:
Recently, the Mobutu rebel group in the Congo, with the connivance and collusion of U.S. imperialism and the "United Nations Forces" command it manipulates, armed and kidnapped national leaders of the Congolese Republic, including Prime Minister Lumumba, and subjected Prime Minister Lumumba to savage insults and imprisonment. This atrocity by U.S. imperialism and its stooges has aroused great indignation among the people of Asian and African countries and all justice-upholding people in the world. The Chinese people fully endorse the statement issued by our government on December 8 on the Congo situation, strongly condemn and protest the serious crimes committed by U.S. imperialism and its stooge, the Mobutu rebel group, and call on the people of Asian and African countries and all peace-loving people to take immediate action to stop the persecution of Prime Minister Lumumba by U.S. imperialism and its stooges, and to stop the aggression and interference by U.S. imperialism and the "United Nations Forces" it manipulates in the Congolese Republic.
The atrocity of kidnapping and persecuting Prime Minister Lumumba shows that U.S. imperialism is the main culprit in creating the chaotic situation in the Congo. U.S. imperialism has been painstakingly trying to strangle the independence of the Congo, continuing to intensify its aggression against the Congo in all aspects, attempting to impose the shackles of American neo-colonialism on the Congolese people, and then to invade and enslave the people of other African countries.
The atrocity of kidnapping and persecuting Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba has once again profoundly educated the people of all countries, making them more aware that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of the whole world. The increasingly awakened Congolese people and African people will understand even more through this incident that in order to win national independence and freedom, they must strengthen the unity of their own ranks and wage a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism and its stooges.
The Chinese people will forever stand on the side of the Congolese people, resolutely support the patriotic and just struggle of the Congolese People to safeguard national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, support the legitimate government of the Congo headed by Prime Minister Lumumba, and support all patriotic and democratic forces in the Congo. We are deeply convinced that as long as the Congolese people unite and carry the struggle through to the end with renewed efforts, and with the strong support of the people of Asia and Africa and the people of the world, they will certainly be able to smash the aggression and interference of imperialism headed by the United States, and will certainly be able to defeat any conspiracy of imperialism and its stooges, thereby achieving the complete victory of national liberation.

    我亚非团结委员会就刚果事件发表声明
    谴责美帝国主义及其走狗的罪行
    坚决支持刚果人民维护独立主权的爱国正义斗争
    新华社9日讯　中国亚非团结委员会今天就美帝国主义及其走狗迫害刚果共和国总理卢蒙巴的暴行发表声明。声明全文如下：
    最近，刚果蒙博托叛乱集团在美帝国主义和它所操纵的“联合国军”司令部的怂恿和合谋下，武装绑架了刚果共和国总理卢蒙巴等国家领导人，并且对卢蒙巴总理施加野蛮的凌辱和监禁。美帝国主义及其走狗的这种暴行引起了亚非各国人民和世界上一切主持正义的人民的极大愤慨。中国人民完全拥护我国政府12月8日就刚果局势所发表的声明，严厉谴责和强烈抗议美帝国主义及其走狗蒙博托叛乱集团所犯下的严重罪行，并且向亚非各国人民和一切爱好和平的人民呼吁，立即采取行动，制止美帝国主义及其走狗对卢蒙巴总理的迫害，制止美帝国主义和它所操纵的“联合国军”对刚果共和国的侵略和干涉。
    绑架和迫害卢蒙巴总理的暴行，表明美帝国主义是造成刚果混乱局势的罪魁祸首。美帝国主义处心积虑地要绞杀刚果的独立，继续加紧从各方面侵略刚果，企图把美国新殖民主义的枷锁套在刚果人民的身上，并进而侵犯和奴役非洲其他国家的人民。
    绑架和迫害刚果总理卢蒙巴的暴行又一次深刻地教育了各国人民，使他们更加认清美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。日益觉醒的刚果人民和非洲人民通过这次事件将更加懂得，要争取民族独立和自由，就必须加强自己队伍的团结，同美帝国主义及其走狗进行坚决的斗争。
    中国人民永远站在刚果人民一边，坚决支持刚果人民维护民族独立、主权和领土完整的爱国正义斗争，支持以卢蒙巴总理为首的刚果合法政府，支持刚果一切爱国民主的力量。我们深信，只要刚果人民团结起来，再接再厉地把斗争进行到底，在亚非人民和世界人民的强大支援下，一定能够粉碎以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略和干涉，一定能够击败帝国主义及其走狗的任何阴谋，从而取得民族解放的彻底胜利。
