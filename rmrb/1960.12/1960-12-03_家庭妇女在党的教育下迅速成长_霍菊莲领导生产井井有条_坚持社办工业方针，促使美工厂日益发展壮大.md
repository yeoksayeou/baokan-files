    This newspaper reports: Huo Julian, a housewife who had been occupied with cooking for twenty years, has made rapid progress after participating in the urban people's commune, undergoing training through collective labor, and receiving education from the Party. She has now become a capable female factory director and has honorably joined the Communist Party of China.
    The Mei (Beautiful Arts) Factory of the Beijing Chunshu People's Commune, where Huo Julian works, is a factory mainly producing gypsum art products, with more than sixty production personnel. Last year, when the commune Party committee sent her to be the factory director, she thought: "I don't understand production technology, nor do I know how to manage. Can a housewife lead a factory?" The commune Party committee encouraged her, saying: "As long as you listen to the Party, rely on the masses, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome." When she returned home and talked about becoming the factory director, her husband—a veteran railway worker—also encouraged her, saying: "Listen to the Party in everything, rely on the masses everywhere, and work hard yourself. Anything can be done well. That's how I was trained from a worker to a stationmaster."
    Huo Julian came to the commune's Mei Factory in February 1959, just before the Spring Festival. She took advantage of the Spring Festival holiday to visit the production personnel's homes, understand their ideological situation, and also talk about the factory's production management issues. In the factory, she worked wherever there was dirt or hard work. Seeing Huo Julian taking the lead in everything, the production personnel were willing to approach her and talk about everything. After a period of work, Huo Julian quickly became familiar with the factory's production management. She then used her spare time to visit relevant stores, inquiring about the opinions of salespersons and customers on their products, as a basis for improving their work.
    As production developed, the factory's scale expanded day by day. She gradually realized that as a factory leader, she could not handle things like she used to handle firewood, rice, oil, and salt at home in a "mishmash," without division of labor or rules. She still held onto the attitude of "learning" first, and with the help of the commune Party committee, she absorbed the experience of other community-run factories and established a management system. From workshop production to finance and warehouse management, a dedicated person was responsible for each. Through mass discussions, systems such as team accounting, administrative expense approval procedures, and material requisition and return were established, and a group of workers' family members was selected from among the activists to participate in management. Her own cultural level was low, so she humbly learned from the accountant, from bookkeeping to financial management, leaving no stone unturned. In a very short time, a normal production order was established in the factory, and all work was carried out in an orderly manner.
    Huo Julian firmly remembered the instructions of the commune Party committee: the key to leading production is to master the Party's policies. At one time, the market urgently needed chalk for schools to use when school started. The commune Party committee designated the Mei Factory to produce it in a timely manner, and Huo Julian accepted this production task without hesitation. The family members of the workers who participated in the production were also very excited to hear the news. However, several technicians who had been transferred from small business owners felt that giving up the high-value gypsum art products to make chalk was both labor-intensive and had low value, and expressed their unwillingness to do it. Huo Julian said to the production personnel: "Our factory is run to serve socialism. Now that the market needs chalk, we will produce chalk." When production began, there was a lack of equipment and they did not understand the technology, so Huo Julian personally led the production personnel to borrow a full set of tools from a chalk factory outside Yongdingmen, and then went to a chalk factory in Xicheng to learn the technology, so that production exceeded the plan every month. From then on, they set aside some people to specialize in producing small commodities needed in the market, such as oilcloth raincoats, envelope pasting, and small iron shovels. Because of adhering to the policy of community-run industry serving large-scale industry and serving the people's lives, the factory's production has also developed day by day. (Attached picture)

    家庭妇女在党的教育下迅速成长
    霍菊莲领导生产井井有条
    坚持社办工业方针，促使美工厂日益发展壮大
    本报讯　二十年来一直围着锅台转的家庭妇女霍菊莲，在参加城市人民公社后，经过集体劳动的锻炼和党的教育，进步很快，现已成为一个能干的女厂长，并光荣地参加了中国共产党。
    霍菊莲所在的北京椿树人民公社美工厂，是一个主要生产石膏美工品的工厂，全厂有六十多名生产人员。去年，公社党委派她当厂长时，她想：“自己既不懂生产技术，又不会经营管理，一个家庭妇女能领导一个工厂吗？”公社党委鼓励她说：“只要听党的话，依靠群众，没有克服不了的困难。”当她回家谈起当厂长的事，她的丈夫——一位铁路老工人也这样鼓励她说：“事事听党的话，处处依靠群众，加上自己努力干，什么事都能办好，我就是这样从一个工人锻炼成车站值班站长的。”
    霍菊莲来到公社美工厂，正是1959年2月快过春节的时候。她利用春节放假的机会，挨门沿户到生产人员家中去访问，了解生产人员的思想情况，也谈工厂的生产管理问题。在厂里，她看到哪里脏哪里累，就到哪里干活。生产人员看见霍菊莲事事都带头干，因此都愿意接近她，无话不谈。经过一段时期的工作以后，霍菊莲很快就熟悉了工厂生产管理方面的情况。于是她又利用休息时间到有关商店，探听售货员和顾客对她们产品的意见，作为改进工作的依据。
    生产发展了，工厂的规模一天天扩大。她逐渐发现自己作为一个工厂领导人，绝不能像过去在家里管柴米油盐那样“一锅粥”，没有分工，没有制度。她还是抱定“学”字当先的态度，在公社党委帮助下，吸取其他社办工厂的经验，建立经营管理制度。从车间生产到财务、仓库管理都实行专人负责制，又通过群众讨论，建立了班组核算、行政开支批准手续和领料退料等制度，并且从积极分子中选拔一批职工家属参加经营管理工作。她自己文化水平低，就虚心向会计学习，从记账到财务管理，无所不钻。在很短时间内，厂内就建立了正常的生产秩序，各项工作井井有条。
    霍菊莲牢牢记住公社党委的指示：领导生产的关键是掌握好党的政策。有个时期，市场上急需供应学校开学使用的粉笔，公社党委指定美工厂及时生产，霍菊莲毫不迟疑地接受了这个生产任务。参加生产的职工家属，听到这个消息也非常兴奋。但是，几个从小业主转业来的技术人员，感到放下产值高的石膏美工品做粉笔，既费工，产值又低，表示不愿干。霍菊莲对生产人员说：“咱们办工厂就是为社会主义服务，现在市场需要粉笔，咱们就生产粉笔。”生产开始时缺乏设备，又不懂技术，霍菊莲就亲自带领生产人员，到永定门外粉笔厂借来全套的工具，随后又到西城一个粉笔厂学习技术，使生产月月超额完成计划。从此，她们就抽出一些人专门生产市场上需要的小商品。如油雨布、糊信封和小铁铲等加工活。由于坚持社办工业为大工业服务、为人民生活服务的方针，全厂生产也日益发展起来。（附图片）
