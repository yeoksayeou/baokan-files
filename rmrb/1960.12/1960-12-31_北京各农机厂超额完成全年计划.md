Beijing agricultural machinery factories have exceeded the annual plan by 29% two months ahead of schedule. By the end of October, Beijing's agricultural machinery factories had produced a large number of agricultural machines for cultivation, irrigation, processing, and harvesting, equipping agriculture and enabling the city's mechanized cultivation area to reach more than 50% of the cultivable area this year, a twofold increase over last year; the machine-sown area increased tenfold over last year. At present, half of the rural people's communes in the city have basically realized the mechanization of grain processing, freeing up a large amount of manpower and animal power to strengthen the front line of agricultural production. The city's machine irrigation benefited area reached more than 2 million mu.

While vigorously manufacturing agricultural machinery, Beijing's agricultural machinery department has stepped up the repair work of agricultural machinery. The city has formed an agricultural machinery repair and fitting network composed of 87 municipal, county, and commune agricultural machinery repair and fitting units, which can basically achieve on-the-spot repairs of transportation machinery and irrigation machinery as soon as they arrive.

    北京各农机厂超额完成全年计划
    本报讯　北京各农业机械厂已提前两个月超额29％完成了全年计划。到10月底，北京市各农业机械厂生产了大批耕作、排灌、加工和收获等农业机械，装备了农业，使今年全市机耕面积达到可机耕面积的50％以上，比去年提高两倍；机器播种面积比去年增长十倍。目前，全市有一半农村人民公社基本上实现了粮食加工机械化，腾出大量人力和畜力加强农业生产第一线。全市机器排灌受益面积达到二百多万亩。
    北京农业机械部门在大造农业机械的同时，抓紧了农业机械的修理工作。全市已由八十七个市、县和公社的农业机械修配单位组成农业机械修配网，可以基本做到运输机械、排灌机械随到随修和就地修理。
