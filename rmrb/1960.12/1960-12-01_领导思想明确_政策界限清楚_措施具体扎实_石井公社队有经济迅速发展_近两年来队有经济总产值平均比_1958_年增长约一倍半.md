This newspaper Zhengzhou, 30th reported: The Shijing People's Commune in Xin'an County, Henan Province, has seen rapid development and growth in its commune-owned economy, based on vigorously helping the development of team-owned economies.

The Shijing Commune is located in a mountainous area with abundant mineral resources and a wide range of diversified business opportunities. Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery all have favorable conditions for development. Based on these characteristics, the Commune Party Committee made an overall plan for the comprehensive development of the economy, paying particular attention to the development of the production brigade (basic accounting unit) economy. All projects that were small in scale, required little investment, yielded quick returns, had relatively simple technology, could utilize local materials, and whose products were directly needed for agricultural production and commune members' lives, such as farm tool repair and assembly, weaving, agricultural and sideline product processing, logging, pastures, and short-distance transportation, were organized and managed by the production brigades with active assistance from the commune. For larger-scale projects whose products were basically needed by several brigades, joint management by brigades could be organized based on specific circumstances. Projects that were large in scale, required a lot of investment, had relatively complex technology, and whose products were needed by the entire commune or needed to be sold in large quantities outside the commune, such as ceramics and machinery factories, were managed by the commune. This division of labor not only fully utilized the superiority of the commune's unified leadership but also greatly mobilized the enthusiasm of the production brigades in developing their economies. Based on the above principles, the commune devolved twelve enterprises originally operated by the commune but suitable for operation by the production brigades last spring, and assisted twenty-three production brigades in establishing farm tool repair factories and local fertilizer factories. The commune only operated four backbone factories and mines, such as ceramics (industrial ceramics) and machinery. There were two factories and mines jointly operated by the commune and brigades and five jointly operated by brigades. Under the leadership and assistance of the commune, more than one hundred industrial and sideline production units were established by the brigades last year, powerfully supporting the development of agricultural production.

In the past two years, the commune has also helped the development of team-owned economies in the following aspects:

First, helping poor teams develop agricultural production. In the past two years, more than 250,000 yuan has been allocated from the commune's own accumulation to support poor teams in purchasing machines, livestock, fertilizers, and farm tools. The Xiwu Brigade used to suffer from disasters and lacked grain every year. Last year, with the help of the commune, it purchased four diesel engines, a steam engine and water pumps, enabling a part of the land to be irrigated, and agriculture achieved a bumper harvest. This year, grain is more than self-sufficient. In addition, the commune also invested in the construction of eight small reservoirs, irrigating more than 5,000 mu of land, and the income of all five poor teams in the commune has caught up with the level of ordinary teams this year.

Second, enriching the leadership backbone of team-run enterprises and strengthening organizational leadership. Last year, the commune selected fifteen cadres from commune-run enterprises who had been trained, were politically strong, and had certain leadership abilities to serve as the leadership backbone in team-run enterprises. At the same time, the Commune Party Committee organized the responsible cadres of commune-affiliated commercial and grain departments to form a special leading group to regularly study and support and help production brigades develop their economies, and organized various departments to serve the development of team-owned economies.

Third, supporting the economic development of brigades with technology and equipment. Commune-run factories and mines regard brigade-run enterprises as their own "satellite factories," and brigade-run enterprises regard commune-run factories and mines as their own "mother factories." In the past two years, the commune machinery factory has manufactured 22,115 pieces of various equipment and production tools for the brigade factories, helping the brigades build twenty-three farm tool repair factories (groups). At the same time, the commune and commune-run enterprises have also adopted methods such as holding short-term training courses to train 580 technicians for the brigades, strengthening the technical force of brigade-run enterprises.

Fourth, helping brigades sell products from diversified operations. Last spring, the sale of wicker baskets and charcoal produced by various brigades was not smooth, so the commune sent experienced cadres to help the brigades sell them in other places.

Under the unified leadership and assistance of the commune, the economic undertakings of the brigades have developed rapidly. In the past two years, the total output value of team-owned economies has increased by approximately 150% on average compared to 1958, of which the total output value of industry and sideline production increased by 50.4% in 1959 compared to 1958.

Because the team-owned economy has developed rapidly, they can all turn over public accumulation funds to the commune in accordance with regulations, which has also strengthened the strength of the commune-owned economy. Last year, the nineteen production brigades in the commune turned over more than 54,000 yuan in public accumulation funds. At the same time, the commune also relied on the accumulation of commune-run enterprises to develop the commune-owned economy. For example, the commune-run porcelain factory used its own accumulation to build small brick and tile factories, lime factories, and small coal kilns. Because this commune implemented the three-level ownership system with the team as the foundation, the economies at all levels have developed rapidly. (Attached picture)

Under the unified leadership of the commune, the Shengshi Brigade of the Shaxi Commune in Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, has resolutely implemented the "three guarantees and one reward" system for several years. Every year, it has successfully completed its production tasks, enabling the team-owned economy to develop and grow rapidly. This year's late rice crop has also been increased.

    领导思想明确　政策界限清楚　措施具体扎实
    石井公社队有经济迅速发展
    近两年来队有经济总产值平均比1958年增长约一倍半
    本报郑州30日电　河南新安县石井人民公社在大力帮助队有经济发展的基础上，社有经济也迅速发展壮大起来。
    石井公社地处山区，矿藏资源丰富，多种经营门路广，农、林、牧、副、渔都具备有利的发展条件。公社党委根据这一特点，对全面发展经济进行了通盘规划，特别是对生产大队（基本核算单位）经济的发展更加重视。凡是规模较小、投资少、收益快、技术较简单、能够就地取材、产品为本队农业生产和社员生活直接需要的，如农具修配、编织、农副产品加工、伐木、牧场、短途运输等二十多个项目，都组织生产大队经营，公社积极给以帮助。对于规模较大、产品基本上是供给几个大队需要的，根据具体情况，可以组织大队与大队联营。规模大、投资多、技术较复杂、产品属于全社需要或者需要大量外销、大队无力经营的，如陶瓷、机械厂等，就由社经营。这样分工以后，既充分发挥了公社统一领导的优越性，又大大调动了生产大队发展经济的积极性。根据以上原则，公社把原来由社营的、而适合生产大队经营的十二个企业，在去年春天就下放给生产大队经营，并协助二十三个生产大队建立了农具修配厂和土化肥厂，公社只经营陶瓷
  （工业用瓷）、机械等四个骨干厂矿。社、队联营的厂矿两个，大队与大队联营的五个。在公社的领导和帮助下，去年一年中，各大队举办的工业、副业生产单位共有一百多个，有力地支援了农业生产的发展。
    近两年来，公社还从以下几个方面帮助队有经济的发展：
    一、帮助穷队发展农业生产。两年来从公社本身的积累中拨出现金二十五万余元，支援穷队购买机器、牲畜、肥料和农具。西沃大队过去由于常遭灾，年年缺粮，去年在公社帮助下，购买了四部柴油机、一部锅驼机和水泵，使一部分土地得到灌溉，农业获得丰收，今年粮食自给有余。另外，公社还投资修了八个小型水库，灌溉面积五千多亩，全社五个穷队今年收入赶上了一般队的水平。
    二、充实队办企业的领导骨干，加强组织领导。去年，公社从社办企业中，抽出经过培养、政治坚强、具有一定领导能力的干部十五人，派到队办企业中充任领导骨干。同时，公社党委并把社属商业、粮食等部门的负责干部组织起来，成立专门的领导小组，定期研究支持和帮助生产大队发展经济的有关问题，组织各部门为发展队有经济服务。
    三、从技术、设备上扶持大队经济发展。社办厂矿把队办的企业当成自己的“卫星厂”，队办企业又把社办厂矿当成自己的“母厂”。两年来，公社机械厂为大队各厂制造了各种设备和生产工具二万二千一百一十五件，帮助大队兴建了二十三个农具修配厂（组）。同时，公社和社办企业还采取举办短期训练班等办法，为大队培训了五百八十名技术员，壮大了队办企业的技术队伍。
    四、帮助大队推销多种经营的产品。去年春季各大队生产的荆条筐和木炭销路不畅，公社就派出有经验的干部帮助大队到外地推销。
    在公社的统一领导和帮助下，各大队的经济事业得到了迅速发展。近两年来，队有经济总产值平均比1958年增长约一倍半，其中工业、副业总产值，1959年比1958年增长了50.4％。
    由于队有经济迅速发展，他们都能按照规定上缴公社公积金，也就壮大了社有经济的力量。去年一年，全社十九个生产大队上缴公积金五万四千多元。同时，公社还依靠社办企业本身的积累，发展了社有经济，如社办瓷厂利用自己的积累，办了小砖瓦厂、石灰厂、小煤窑等。这个公社由于执行了队为基础的三级所有制，因而使各级经济都得到了迅速的发展。（附图片）
