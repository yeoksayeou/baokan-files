Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 8th. The government of the United Arab Republic announced tonight that the UAR has decided to withdraw its battalion of troops sent to the Congo under the command of the "United Nations Force."

The statement issued by the UAR government said that "some units of the United Nations Force Headquarters actually participated in actions aimed at enabling colonialism and its servants to eliminate nationalists, they participated in arresting nationalist leaders and handing them over to the servants of colonialism," and "we saw Lumumba, who invited the United Nations to the Congo, being bound with ropes, beaten and bleeding."

The statement pointed out that "all this happened while the United Nations flag was flying over the Congo, as if the United Nations sent troops to eliminate the independent, nationalist rule there and restore imperialist rule over the Republic of the Congo."

The statement concluded, "Because of the current attitude taken by the United Nations Force Headquarters in the Congo, the UAR cannot allow its battalion of troops to continue under its command. The UAR made this decision with sadness for the fate of the freedom of the Congo, and regrets that, under the control of imperialist countries, the United Nations Force Headquarters has degenerated to the point of threatening peace."

Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, December 8th. Ceylonese Prime Minister Mrs. Bandaranaike announced tonight that the Ceylonese government has decided to immediately recall the Ceylonese soldiers in the United Nations forces in the Congo to protest the kidnapping of Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba and imperialist interference in the Congo.

She said that this measure was taken to "express our deep dissatisfaction with the development of the situation."

The Prime Minister said in a press release that the United Nations General Assembly's decision to allow Kasavubu's delegation to obtain a seat in the United Nations "deeply shocked us." She accused the decision of being full of "Cold War atmosphere and colonial spirit."

The Prime Minister reiterated Ceylon's position that "the Lumumba government is the legitimate government of the Congo, and Kasavubu's dismissal of him is invalid." She said that the Ceylonese government fully believes that, in the situation in the Congo, Lumumba has the support of the people, and he advocates the progressive proposition of Congolese unity and independence.

Mrs. Bandaranaike condemned imperialist interference in the Congo and the Mobutu group's kidnapping and imprisonment of Lumumba and torturing him in an inhuman way. (Attached picture)

    抗议“联合国军”充当帝国主义侵略刚果工具
    阿联锡兰宣布撤出在刚果的军队
    新华社开罗8日电　阿拉伯联合共和国政府今晚宣布，阿联已决定撤出它派到刚果受“联合国军”司令部指挥的一营军队。
    由阿联政府发表的声明说，“联合国军司令部的一些部队实际上参加了目的在使殖民主义和殖民主义的仆从清除民族主义者的行动，他们参加逮捕民族主义领袖，并把他们移交给殖民主义的仆从”，而且“我们看到邀请联合国来刚果的卢蒙巴被绳子缚着遭受殴打并流了血”。
    声明指出，“这一切都发生在联合国的旗帜在刚果上空飘扬的时候，仿佛联合国派出军队是为了消除那里的独立的、民族主义统治和恢复帝国主义对刚果共和国的统治。”
    声明最后说，“由于联合国军司令部目前在刚果所采取的态度，阿联不能让它的一营军队继续置于它的指挥之下。阿联作出这项决定时，对刚果自由的命运怀着忧伤的心情，同时引为遗憾的是，在帝国主义国家的控制下，联合国军司令部已堕落到威胁和平的地步。”
    据新华社科伦坡8日电　锡兰总理班达拉奈克夫人今天晚上宣布，锡兰政府已经决定立即召回在刚果联合国部队中的锡兰军人，以表示抗议绑架刚果总理卢蒙巴和帝国主义对刚果的干涉。
    她说，采取这项措施是“表示我们对事态发展的深刻不满”。
    这位总理在一份新闻公报中说，联合国大会关于使卡萨武布的代表团在联合国中取得席位的决定“使我们深为震惊”。她指责这项决定充满“冷战气息和殖民主义精神”。
    这位总理重申锡兰的立场，认为“卢蒙巴政府是刚果的合法政府，卡萨武布解除他的职务是无效的。”她说，锡兰政府完全认为，在刚果的形势下，卢蒙巴受到人民的支持，他拥护刚果统一和独立的进步主张。
    班达拉奈克夫人谴责帝国主义干涉刚果和蒙博托集团绑架和监禁卢蒙巴以及用不人道的方式折磨他。（附图片）
