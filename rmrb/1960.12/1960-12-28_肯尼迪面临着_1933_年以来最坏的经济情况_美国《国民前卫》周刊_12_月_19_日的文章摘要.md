When Kennedy enters the White House next month, he will encounter an economic crisis more severe than any new president since Roosevelt took office. No incoming administration has faced a more serious economic problem than the current one since the dark days of March 1933.

As Kennedy ascends to the presidency, the nation will be in the midst of its fourth post-war recession. Almost all economic indicators – from the declining Gross National Product to the rising spring sales – show that the situation is deteriorating.

Although the current recession is similar to the first three post-war recessions in many ways, it differs in one important aspect. Due to the huge international balance of payments deficit in the United States, this recession is much more severe. Historically, the country's foreign economic policy has never had such a significant impact on the domestic economy. Therefore, the Kennedy administration in 1961 may face even more difficult problems than Roosevelt faced in 1933. The drain of the Cold War: The current decline is merely a symptom of a more fundamental imbalance. This imbalance is that the Cold War has not brought sustained prosperity to the American people. The Cold War has developed to such an extent that it has not only failed to superficially eliminate the country's economic ills, but has actually acted as a poison that worsens these ills.

Due to the adverse effects of the Cold War on international payments, the U.S. economy can no longer maintain both the Cold War and a high standard of living. The Cold War has not brought the American people both guns and butter; it has made them face a choice between guns and butter.

To better understand the problems Kennedy will face, let's examine the current economic situation. Decline: The Gross National Product has been declining since this summer. This decline is occurring despite rising military spending, which is intriguing. According to official reports, military spending this summer was at an annual rate of $45.1 billion, compared to $44 billion in the winter of 1958, and $44.7 billion at an annual rate in the spring of this year when the Gross National Product reached an unprecedented high.

According to the Federal Reserve Board, industrial production has been declining since January. Increased military spending has not been able to stop this decline, and there is good reason to believe that industrial production will decline further in the coming months.

Business inventories are now higher than at the start of the 1957-1958 recession. However, sales are unlikely to rise sharply because new orders are decreasing.

In addition, wholesale prices for many commodities are falling. Therefore, there is no incentive for entrepreneurs to stockpile large inventories in the hope of profiting from rising prices. They are now more likely to face ruin due to falling prices. Therefore, they will keep inventories at the lowest possible level, i.e., below what has hitherto been considered normal. The situation facing the steel industry: The overall decline in industrial production began with a decline in steel production. After breaking all previous records in January, steel production fell to 50% of capacity for most of this year. Production in November 1960 was more than one million tons lower than in November 1959, even though steel mills were closed for nearly two weeks in November 1959 due to a steel strike.

A recent article in "The Wall Street Journal" (November 28th) stated that most steel companies expect production to decline even further. The prospects for the main markets for steel (automobiles, machinery, and construction) are not very bright. Unsold Cars: Automobile factories produce approximately 30,000 cars per day. However, dealers only sell 20,000 cars per day. And sales have been declining.

Therefore, automobile inventories have been rising rapidly. By the end of November, dealers had approximately one million unsold cars, an unprecedentedly high number for this time of year.

Therefore, automobile production will be cut unless dealers experience some miraculous surge in sales. Even if such a miracle occurs, its benefits to the steel industry will be limited. Today, approximately 35% of cars produced are compact cars, which use less steel than standard cars.

However, the possibility of such a miracle occurring is slim. Sales of new cars mainly depend on the ups and downs of old car prices and the ease of obtaining loans. Old Car Prices: Since most people who might buy a new car already have one, their decision to buy a car in many cases depends on how much they get for their old car. The trade-in allowance offered by the dealer to his customer will depend on the price at which he sells the old car on the open market.

Currently, old car prices are at their lowest post-war levels. Cars imported from abroad and American compact cars have taken away a large portion of the market for old cars, thereby causing dealers to accumulate large stocks of old cars.

Since old car prices are low, new car sales will decline unless loan terms are greatly eased. In 1955, the easing of loan terms brought new car sales to record levels. Loan situation: In that year, the down payment for purchasing a new car was reduced from one-third to one-quarter or one-fifth of the new car's value, and the repayment period was extended from twenty-four months to thirty-six months.

This method, which was very successful in 1955, cannot work today. Due to the drop in old car prices, no bank or finance company would agree to greatly reduce the down payment or greatly extend the repayment period, say, from thirty-six months to forty-eight months.

However, loan terms can be eased in another way, that is, by lowering interest rates.

Although the incoming Kennedy administration can take steps to lower interest rates, its ability to do so will be limited by the extent to which it pursues the Cold War. As long as the Cold War continues, loan terms cannot be eased to the extent necessary to raise car sales to new heights.

Therefore, the prospects for the automobile industry, which are better than those of any other major industry, are not very good. Capital expenditure: Another discouraging sign is that capital expenditure is expected to decline. McGraw-Hill Publishing Company noted in its annual survey of business spending that companies plan to reduce spending by 3% next year. According to McGraw-Hill Publishing Company economist Greenwald, corporate spending may decrease by as much as 7%.

If capital expenditure really decreases, this will not only hit the machinery manufacturing industry, the steel industry, the construction industry, and many related industries, but more importantly, it will slow down the rate of economic development, perhaps even reverse it. And the slowdown in the rate of development will seriously increase the serious problems already faced by the Kennedy administration.

Unless the overall economic outlook improves, capital expenditure cannot increase. As long as interest rates are high, the overall outlook cannot be good enough to stimulate capital expenditure and promote economic development. Moreover, the Cold War limits the extent to which interest rates can be lowered. Housing construction: Housing construction is another sluggish sector. Housing construction is significantly lower than in 1959.

Interest is a major factor in the cost of housing construction. As long as interest rates are high, housing construction will be strictly limited to high-income families. In the past few recessions, interest rates have fallen significantly. Therefore, housing construction has grown rapidly. In the current recession, mortgage rates have fallen very little, so the number of housing construction projects has not increased. In housing construction, as in other industries, the Cold War has had adverse effects through its impact on interest rates.

The prospects for unemployment are even worse. Unemployment: In October of this year, the number of people officially reported as unemployed full-time increased by 191,000. This is the largest increase in unemployment in October since the end of World War II. Usually, unemployment falls significantly in October. There have only been two previous occasions when unemployment has risen in October, once during the coal miners' strike in 1949 and once during the steel strike in 1959. And in both of these cases, the increase in unemployment was much lower than the unemployment in October 1960.

In October, the number of full-time unemployed was 3.6 million, accounting for 6.4% of the labor force, the highest percentage of unemployment since December 1958. The large number of unemployed in October is very significant because unemployment usually rises rapidly between October and February. According to the Labor Department, seasonal layoffs will typically cause unemployment to reach 5.3 million in February. "The Wall Street Journal" (November 8th) indicated that this year's layoffs will be more than usual. In a survey of 200 large companies in major cities across the country, the newspaper found that most companies intend to lay off more workers this winter than usual.

Therefore, when the Kennedy administration is sworn in, unemployment may exceed six million. Regardless of whether unemployment reaches this post-war record level, it will be a number high enough to require the President's immediate attention.

    肯尼迪面临着1933年以来最坏的经济情况
    美国《国民前卫》周刊12月19日的文章摘要
    当肯尼迪下个月进入白宫时，他所碰到的经济危机将比罗斯福担任总统以来任何一个新总统所碰到的经济危机都要严重。自从1933年3月那些阴暗的日子以来，任何一个上台的政府都没有碰到过比目前更严重的经济问题。
    在肯尼迪登上总统宝座的时候，全国将处在战后第四次衰退中间。几乎所有的经济指标——从正在下降的国民生产毛值到正在上升的春季销售量——都表明情况在日益恶化。
    虽然目前的衰退在许多方面同战后的头三次衰退是一样的，但是在一个重要方面是不同的。由于美国出现巨额的国际支付逆差，因此这次衰退要严重得多，在历史上这个国家的对外经济政策从来没有对国内经济产生这么大的影响的。因此，1961年的肯尼迪政府要解决的问题可能比罗斯福在1933年所面临的问题还要棘手。冷战的消耗：目前的下降只是一种更为基本的失调情况的征象。这种失调情况就是冷战没有给美国人民带来持续的繁荣。冷战已经发展到了这样一种程度，它不仅没有能够起到表面上消除这个国家经济上的病痛的作用，而且实际上起了使这些病痛恶化的毒药的作用。
    由于冷战对国际支付所产生的不良影响，美国的经济不再能够同时保持冷战和保持高度的生活水平，冷战没有给美国人民同时带来大炮和奶油，冷战使他们面临要大炮还是要奶油的选择。
    为了更清楚地了解肯尼迪将面临的问题，让我们来研究一下目前经济究竟是什么情况。下　降：国民生产毛值从今年夏天开始下降。这种下降是在军事开支上升的情况下发生的，这一点是耐人寻味的。据官方报道，今年夏天的军事费用的年率是四百五十一亿美元，而1958年冬是四百四十亿美元，而在国民生产毛值达到空前高度的今年春季，军事费用为年率的四百四十七亿美元。
    据联邦储备委员会统计，自1月以来工业生产一直是下降的。增加军事开支并没有能够制止这种下降，而且有充分理由相信，在今后几个月内工业生产将会进一步下降。
    企业存货现在比1957—1958年的衰退开始时要多。但是销售量大概不会急剧上升，因为新的订货在减少。
    此外，许多商品的批发价格正在下降。因此没有刺激力量使企业家们储存大量存货以期从价格上升中大赚其钱。他们现在更可能碰到的情况是由于价格下降而弄得倾家荡产。因此，他们将把存货保持在最低的水平，即低于到目前为止认为是正常的水平。钢铁业面临的情况：工业生产的全面下降是由钢铁生产下降开始的。钢铁生产在1月份突破了所有以前的纪录以后，在今年的大多数时间内下降到了生产能力的50％。1960年11月的产量比1959年11月的产量减少一百多万吨，虽然在1959年11月由于钢铁罢工，钢铁厂还停工了将近两星期。
    最近《华尔街日报》（11月28日）发表的一篇文章说，据大多数钢铁公司预计，生产甚至将进一步下降。钢铁的主要市场（汽车、机器和建筑业）前景并不太妙。没有出售的汽车：汽车工厂每天生产汽车大约三万辆。但是，经售商每天出售的汽车只有两万辆。而且销售量也一直在下降。
    因此，汽车存货一直在迅速上升。到11月底经售商手里的汽车大约有一百万辆没有卖出去，照每年这个时候的汽车存货来说，这是空前高的数字。
    因此，汽车生产将会削减，除非经售商的出现某种奇迹销售量能急剧增加。如果出现这种奇迹的话，它对钢铁工业的好处也将是有限的。在今天，生产的汽车中大约有35％是小型汽车，而这种汽车所用的钢铁比标准的汽车要少。
    但是，出现这种奇迹的可能性是微乎其微的。新汽车的销售量主要决定于旧汽车价格的上落和获得贷款的难易。旧汽车的价格：由于可能购买新汽车的大多数人都是本来有汽车的，所以他们决定买不买汽车在许多情况下取决于他们旧汽车折价多少，经售商向他的顾客提出的折价将取决于他在公开市场上出售旧汽车的价格。
    目前旧汽车的价格是战后最低的。从外国进口的汽车和美国的小型汽车抢走了旧汽车很大一部分市场，从而使经售商手里积存了大量的旧汽车。
    由于旧汽车价格很低，新汽车的销售量将会下降，除非贷款的条件大大放宽。在1955年，贷款条件的放宽使新汽车的销售量达到创记录的水平。贷款情况：在那一年，购买新汽车的第一次的付款从新汽车价值的三分之一减少到了四分之一和五分之一，而偿还时间从二十四个月延长到三十六个月。
    这种在1955年十分成功的办法今天不能起作用了。由于旧汽车价格下跌，没有一家银行或金融公司会同意大大降低第一次付款的条件或者大大延长偿还时间，比方说，从三十六个月延长到四十八个月。
    但是贷款条件可以用另一种方法来放宽，那就是降低利率。
    虽然即将上任的肯尼迪政府可以采取降低利率的步骤，但是它这样作的能力将会受到它要进行冷战的程度的限制。只要冷战继续下去，贷款条件就不可能放宽到足以使汽车销售量提高到新的高度的程度。
    因此，现在比其他任何重要工业的情景都好的汽车工业的前景并不是太好的。资本开支：另一个令人泄气的迹象是，预计资本开支将下降。麦格劳—希耳出版公司在对企业开支的年度调查报告中注意到，各公司计划在明年把开支减少3％。据麦格劳—希耳出版公司的经济学家格林沃耳德的估计，企业的开支可能减少7％之多。
    如果资本开支真的减少的话，这将不仅会使机器制造业、钢铁工业、建筑工业和许多有关工业受到打击，而且更重要的是将会减慢经济发展的速度，也许甚至是开倒车。而发展速度的下降将会严重增加肯尼迪政府已经面临的严重问题。
    除非总的经济前景好了，否则资本开支不可能增加，只要利率很高，总的前景就不可能好到足以刺激资本开支和促进经济发展的地步。而且，冷战限制了利率能够降低的程度。房屋建筑：房屋建筑是另一个不景气的部分。房屋建筑大大低于1959年的水平。
    利息是房屋建筑成本中的一个主要因素。只要利率很高，房屋建筑将严格限于收入很高的人家。在过去几次衰退中，利率下降了许多。因此房屋建筑迅速增长。在目前的衰退中，抵押利率下降得很少，因此房屋建筑幢数没有上升。在房屋建筑中像其他工业一样，冷战通过它对利率的影响也产生恶果。
    失业的前景甚至更坏。失　业：今年10月，据官方报道全日失业的人数增加了十九万一千人。这是自从第二次世界大战结束以来10月份失业人数增加得最多的一个月。通常失业人数在10月是大大下降的。以前只有两次，10月份的失业人数是上升的，一次是1949年煤矿工人罢工，另一次是1959年钢铁罢工。而这两次，增加的失业人数都比1960年10月的失业人数少得多。
    10月全日失业人数有三百六十万，占劳动力的6.4％，这是1958年12月份以来最高的失业人数百分比。10月份失业人数这么多是很有意义的，因为在10月份到2月份之间，失业人数通常是迅速上升的。据劳工部估计，通常在2月份由于季节性的解雇将使失业人数达到五百三十万。《华尔街日报》（11月8日）表示，今年的解雇将比通常要多。这家报纸在对全国各大城市二百家大公司的调查报告中发现大多数公司都打算在今年冬天解雇比通常多的工人。
    因此，当肯尼迪政府宣誓就职时，失业人数可能超过六百万。不管失业人数是否会达到这个战后创纪录的水平，这总归是一个高得足以要求总统立即加以注意的数字。
