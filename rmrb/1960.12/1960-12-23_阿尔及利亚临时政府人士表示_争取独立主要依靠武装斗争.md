Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 22nd: According to Kyodo News Agency reports from Cairo, figures from the Algerian Provisional Government told their reporters on the 20th that Algeria's struggle for independence will mainly rely on armed struggle in the future.

The person made these remarks while commenting on the United Nations' discussion of the Algerian question. He said that, originally, the struggle at the United Nations was secondary, and that armed struggle would be the main thing in the future.

Speaking of the propaganda that De Gaulle had changed his policy to negotiate with the Algerian Provisional Government after his visit to Algeria, the person said, "This is a tactic to deceive public opinion, and we have absolutely no expectations." He said that the Algerian nationalists' distrust of France is growing stronger. During De Gaulle's visit to Algeria, the demonstrations held by (Algerian) Muslims showed that Algerian "autonomy" that excludes the Algerian National Liberation Front is meaningless, and showed that it is impossible to express free will under French rule.

The Provisional Government figure emphasized, "Whether it is President De Gaulle or the far-right colonists, they are only different in tactics, and there is no difference in essence."

    阿尔及利亚临时政府人士表示
    争取独立主要依靠武装斗争
    新华社22日讯　东京消息：据共同社自开罗报道，阿尔及利亚临时政府人士20日对这家通讯社的记者发表谈话时指出，阿尔及利亚争取独立的斗争今后主要还是武装斗争。
    这位人士是在评论联合国关于阿尔及利亚问题的讨论时说这番话的。他说，本来，在联合国的斗争是次要的，今后主要还是武装斗争。
    这位人士在谈到所谓戴高乐在访问阿尔及利亚以后已经转变要采取同阿尔及利亚临时政府谈判的方针的宣传时说，“这是企图欺骗舆论的策略，我们完全没有寄予期望。”他说，阿尔及利亚民族主义者不信任法国的念头越来越强烈了。在戴高乐访问阿尔及利亚的时候，（阿尔及利亚）穆斯林举行的示威表明，把阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线排斥在外的阿尔及利亚“自治”是没有意义的，并且表明在法国统治下表示自由意志是不可能的。
    这位临时政府人士强调指出，“戴高乐总统也好，极右派的殖民者也好，他们只是策略上的不同，在本质上是没有两样的。”
