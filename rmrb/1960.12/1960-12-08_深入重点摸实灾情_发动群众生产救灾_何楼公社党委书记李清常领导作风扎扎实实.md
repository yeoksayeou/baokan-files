    This newspaper reports: In the in-depth development of the production and disaster relief campaign, Li Qingchang, First Secretary of the Helou Commune Party Committee in Heze City, Shandong Province, used the method of "dissecting a sparrow" to delve into two small teams of the Zimus shu (Mother-tree) Brigade, one of the commune's most severely affected teams. He consulted with team cadres to check and understand the situation of each household, ascertain the real situation, and further promote the in-depth development of the commune's production and disaster relief campaign.
    Helou Commune is a heavily affected commune in Heze City. This summer and autumn, the commune experienced three heavy rainfalls in succession, and more than 90% of the land suffered from varying degrees of waterlogging. After the disaster, under the leadership of party organizations at all levels, the masses were mobilized to rely on the people's commune to carry out a tenacious struggle against the flood. More than 30,000 mu of crops were rescued, a large amount of autumn vegetables were replanted, and more than 90,000 mu of wheat were planted in a timely manner, thereby laying a certain material foundation for production and disaster relief work. At the same time, the state supplied a considerable amount of grain and some relief funds to support the commune in overcoming the disaster. Under this situation, cadres developed a sense of complacency. They remained at the level of calculating the overall accounts, saying, "A portion of the missing grain has been supplied by the state, and some vegetables have been planted, so life is not difficult." In reality, many people did not understand what the real situation was.
    The Zimus shu Production Brigade is one of the most severely affected teams in Helou Commune. After the disaster, the party branch led the masses to rescue 750 mu of sweet potatoes and replant a batch of autumn vegetables. By early October, the sweet potatoes had been harvested and stored, and the autumn vegetables had also been harvested well. At the same time, the wheat planting plan was overfulfilled. Chao Yueliang, the secretary of the team branch, reported to Li Qingchang, secretary of the commune party committee, "Secretary Li, rest assured! This year will be a good year!" He also said that grain, salt, vegetables, firewood, etc., had all been arranged. However, Comrade Li Qingchang was not satisfied with these reports. He came to the thirteenth small team, which was the most severely affected, and visited fields, canteens, and commune members' homes. He also held a forum attended by cadres, poor peasants, and lower-middle peasants, and sorted out and investigated the living problems of the team's sixty commune members household by household. In the household-by-household investigation, he learned that although most households in the team could manage after the previous arrangements, there were still some households with more serious difficulties. They generally had more people, fewer laborers, and a weaker foundation, so they had more difficulties. For example, the Chao Chunhuan family of five, with two female laborers (one of whom had a long-term illness), still had some difficulties in life. Under the leadership of Comrade Li Qingchang, the following production methods were immediately found to help this family: 1. The Chao Chunhuan family, big and small, can all paste matchboxes. During the slack winter season, calculated at 500 boxes per person per day, they can earn 25 cents per day, for a total income of 25 yuan in 100 days; 2. Organize participation in collective sideline production of sweeping soil for saltpeter, which can earn more than 5 yuan; the remaining portion will be subsidized by social relief funds. By calculating detailed accounts household by household, not only was the financial situation of each commune member's household clarified, but also the financial situation of the team was further clarified: of the team's 217 people, the vast majority of their grain needed to be supplied by the state, and more than 2,000 yuan was still needed to purchase grain, firewood, vegetables, and salt; firewood was also still a problem. Under the help of Comrade Li Qingchang, relying on the policy of production for disaster relief, this was also resolved.
    Were there any problems in the better teams? Comrade Li Qingchang went to the fourth small team to conduct investigation and research. This small team was less affected by the disaster, and the team leaders had also made preliminary arrangements for the grain, vegetables, firewood, and grass needed by the team's 47 commune members after the disaster. However, after sorting out household by household, it was also found that some households also had some difficulties in housing, cotton clothing, and heating.
    In the process of in-depth investigation, Comrade Li Qingchang mobilized the masses according to the party's policies and principles, and solved the problems specifically. For example, on the issue of insufficient firewood, some commune members had a mentality of dependency, waiting for the state to supply coal. In order to solve this problem, he not only visited commune members, but also specially convened a meeting of commune members, publicized the party's production and disaster relief policy, and explained that coal not only had to be supplied for the people's livelihood, but also had to guarantee steel production and other industrial uses, so it was necessary to mainly rely on their own methods to solve the firewood problem. As a result, the commune members came up with many ways to collect firewood. For example, commune member Chao Dairang suggested that there was wasteland full of wild grass on the Yellow River beach near Gaozhuang, which could be cut; Chao Yuejun suggested changing the existing ventilation stoves to bellows stoves to save firewood. By organizing a team to collect firewood, 100,000 jin of grass were cut in just half a month. After the remodeling of bellows stoves in each canteen, the amount of coal used was also reduced from 14 liang per person per day to half a jin. Because of the unity of purpose from top to bottom, clarifying the situation, and formulating specific production and disaster relief measures, the commune members strengthened their confidence in overcoming the famine.
    Now, Helou Commune has successively held three enlarged meetings of the commune party committee, using the facts of the Zimus shu Production Brigade as a basis to systematically examine and overcome the complacent mood in the minds of the cadres; the commune's cadres have gone deep into 331 small teams, and are sorting out and investigating household by household according to the method of the Zimus shu Production Brigade; the problems found are being solved in every possible way by mobilizing the masses.

    深入重点摸实灾情  发动群众生产救灾
    何楼公社党委书记李清常领导作风扎扎实实
    本报讯　在深入开展生产救灾运动中，山东菏泽市何楼公社党委第一书记李清常，运用“解剖麻雀”的方法，深入全社重灾队之一——子母树大队的两个小队，会同队干部逐户检查了解情况，摸实底细，从而进一步推动了全社生产救灾运动的深入开展。
    何楼公社是菏泽市的一个重灾社。今年夏秋，这个社连降三次暴雨，90％以上土地遭受了不同程度的涝灾；受灾后，在各级党组织领导下，发动群众，依靠人民公社，向水灾进行了顽强的斗争，抢救出三万多亩庄稼，抢种了大量秋菜，适时种好九万多亩小麦，从而为生产救灾工作打下了一定的物质基础。同时，国家供应了相当数量的口粮和一部分救济款，支援这个社抗灾度荒。在这种形势下，干部产生了自满情绪。他们停留在笼统地算大账上，说：“缺一部分口粮由国家供应了，又种上了一些菜，日子不难过”。实际上到底怎么样，很多人都搞不清楚。
    子母树生产大队是何楼公社受灾较重的一个队。这个队遭灾以后，党支部领导群众救出了七百五十亩甘薯，抢种了一批秋菜；到10月上旬，甘薯已收获入库，秋菜收获也很好，同时超额完成了种麦计划。队支部书记晁月良向公社党委书记李清常汇报情况时说：“李书记，放心吧！今年日子好过。”并说粮、盐、菜、柴等都已安排好。但是李清常同志没有满足这些汇报。他来到受灾最重的十三小队，深入田间、食堂、社员家庭访问，并召开了由干部、贫农和下中农参加的座谈会，对全队六十户社员生活问题逐户进行了排队和摸底。在逐户摸底中，他了解到这个小队虽然大部分户经过前段的安排都可以过得去，但也还有少部分户仍然存有比较严重的困难。他们一般是人口多、劳力少、底子薄，因此困难较多。如晁春环家五口人，两个女劳力（一个长年有病），生活还存有一些困难。在李清常同志的领导下，立即帮助这家人找出以下的生产门路：一、晁春环一家大小都会糊火柴盒，冬闲时，按每人每天糊五百盒计，每天可收入二角五分，一百天共可收入二十五元；二、组织参加扫土硝集体副业，可收入五元以上；其余部分决定由社会救济款给予补助。通过逐户算细账，不但摸清了每户社员的家底，也进一步澄清了这个小队的家底：全队二百一十七口人，口粮绝大部分都要国家供应，购买粮、柴、菜、盐尚需两千多元；烧柴也还是个问题。在李清常同志的帮助下，依靠生产救灾的方针，也得到了解决。
    较好的队有没有问题呢？李清常同志又到第四小队去进行调查研究。这个小队受灾较轻，灾后小队领导上对全队四十七户社员所需粮、菜、柴、草也作过初步安排；但经逐户排队，也发现有一部分户，在住房、棉衣、取暖等方面也有些困难。
    在深入摸底过程中，李清常同志就根据党的方针政策，发动群众，加以具体解决。如烧柴不足问题，一部分社员存在着依赖思想，等待国家供应煤炭。为了解决这个问题，他不但访问了社员，还专门召开了社员会，宣传了党的生产救灾方针，说明煤炭不仅要供应群众生活用，也还要保证钢铁生产及其他工业用，因此必须主要靠自己想办法解决烧柴问题。结果社员们想出了很多打柴的办法。如社员晁岱让提出高庄一带黄河滩上遍地是荒草，可以去割；晁月军提议把现有的通风灶改为风箱灶，节约烧柴。经组织远征拾柴队，仅半个月就割草十万斤。各个食堂改建风箱灶后，用煤量也由每人每天十四两降低到半斤。由于上下一心，摸清了情况，订出了具体生产救灾措施，社员们都增强了度荒的信心。
    现在，何楼公社已连续召开了三次社党委扩大会，以子母树生产大队的事实为据，系统地检查与克服干部思想上的自满情绪；全社干部已深入到三百三十一个小队，按照子母树生产大队的办法逐户排队摸底；摸到的问题，就发动群众千方百计加以解决。
