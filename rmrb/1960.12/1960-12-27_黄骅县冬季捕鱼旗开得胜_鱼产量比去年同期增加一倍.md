    Huanghua County's Winter Fishing Achieves Initial Success
    Fish Production Doubles Compared to the Same Period Last Year
    (Our dispatch) Hebei's Huanghua County, in its winter fishing efforts, has conscientiously implemented the Party's policies and adopted a "three-pronged approach" to further mobilize the enthusiasm of commune members for fishing, resulting in an auspicious start to winter fishing production. From the beginning of December to the 19th, more than 10,000 commune members have participated in fishing activities, catching a total of 200,000 jin of fish, more than double the amount compared to the same period last year.
    Huanghua County has 900,000 mu of water surface, with abundant aquatic resources. In order to fully utilize these resources and supply the needs of urban and rural people, the Huanghua County Party Committee adopted a "three-pronged approach" (combining large-scale fishing with small-scale fishing, combining large nets with small nets, and combining professional teams with mass fishing) to mobilize more commune members to engage in fishing production. In terms of fishing area, the fishing grounds and areas of activity have been re-divided. Currently, more than 4,000 people have formed 130 professional teams, engaged in collective fish management activities. In addition, more than 11,000 people are engaged in small-scale fish management, utilizing more than 2,300 nets of various types, including fine nets, seine nets, and nylon nets. At the same time, 46 units from other places have come to Dagang to engage in fish management. (Attached picture)

    黄骅县冬季捕鱼旗开得胜
    鱼产量比去年同期增加一倍
    本报讯　河北黄骅县在冬季捕鱼当中，认真贯彻党的政策，采取“三结合”的办法，进一步调动起社员的捕鱼积极性，使冬季捕鱼生产旗开得胜。从12月初到19日，已有一万多名社员参加了捕鱼活动，共捕鱼二十万斤，比去年同期增加一倍以上。
    黄骅县有九十万亩水面，水产资源很丰富。中共黄骅县委为了充分利用水产资源，供应城乡人民需要，采取了“三结合”（大宗捕鱼和零星捕鱼结合、大网具和小网具结合、专业队和群众捕捞结合）的办法，发动更多的社员投入捕鱼生产。在捕捞面积上，重新划分了鱼场和活动范围。现在有四千多人组成了一百三十个专业队，投入集体治鱼活动。并有一万一千多人搞起了零星治鱼，共利用起了细网、拉网、尼龙网等网具二千三百多条。同时，外地已有四十六个单位来到大港治鱼。（附图片）
