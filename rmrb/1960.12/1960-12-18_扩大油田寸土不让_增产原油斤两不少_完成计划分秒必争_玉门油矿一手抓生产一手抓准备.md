    Expanding the Oilfield Without Giving Up an Inch, Increasing Crude Oil Production Without Missing an Ounce, Completing the Plan by Cherishing Every Second
    Yumen Oil Mine Grasps Production with One Hand and Preparation with the Other

    (Our newspaper’s Lanzhou dispatch, December 17th) The Yumen Petroleum Administration, while vigorously grasping current crude oil production, is also greatly focusing on production preparation work for next year.

    In order to increase oil production by every possible means, the Party Committee of this bureau put forward the battle cry of "not giving up an inch for expanding the oilfield, not missing an ounce for increasing crude oil production, and cherishing every second for completing the plan ahead of schedule" as early as the end of June. On the one hand, it concentrated superior forces to vigorously engage in oil extraction; on the other hand, it adopted four main measures to actively prepare for next year's production and meet the sustained leap forward in oil production next year.

    An important measure to achieve a sustained leap forward in crude oil production next year is to quickly find new oilfields. To this end, an exploration headquarters has been established to vigorously conduct exploration work in key areas. At present, this work has achieved significant results. In order to move forward as much as possible and prepare some of next year's work in advance this winter, more than a dozen exploration teams from this bureau are still persisting in winter construction in the field to speed up the progress of exploration work. In addition, this bureau has also arranged a certain amount of manpower to strengthen the exploration work on the edges of existing oilfields, further expanding the oilfield area, and providing a strong guarantee for completing next year's crude oil production plan.

    Another important measure to ensure a sustained leap forward in production next year is to comprehensively promote technical measures and advanced experiences that directly play a role in solving key production problems. This year, through the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the Yumen Petroleum Administration has enabled thousands of workers to get rid of heavy manual labor, and 74% of oil wells have promoted new technologies. In order to further promote the achievements of the technical revolution, in the past two months, the factories, departments, and companies under the bureau, closely combined with the current production and preparation work for next year, under the leadership of the Party committee, adopted the "three-way combination" method and, according to different types of work such as oil extraction, drilling, oil refining, machinery manufacturing, and capital construction, further carried out centralized sorting, review, and appraisal of the achievements of the technical revolution, and summed up 421 technical measures and advanced experiences, of which 115 were major advanced experiences. In the past, Well No. 6 in the Ya'erxia Oilfield had to overhaul its pump once a month. After the promotion of new technology, the overhaul time of the oil pump can be extended to three months, and the daily crude oil production has increased from the original 13 tons to about 20 tons. Next year, after the universal promotion of this experience, the entire bureau can increase production by thousands of tons of crude oil.

    The third measure to ensure a leap forward in production next year is to rely on self-reliance, start early, and strive to develop small-scale raw material industries, vigorously engage in comprehensive utilization and diversified operations. Up to now, the Yumen Petroleum Administration has established more than 30 "Second Group" material factories, of which steel, iron, cement, welding rods, etc. have begun to be produced in batches. Sulfuric acid used for refined oil products and hydrofluoric acid necessary for oil extraction and well prevention have now achieved self-sufficiency or partial self-sufficiency. Unified arrangements have also been made for the machinery and equipment needed for industrial development next year.

    While doing a good job in the above preparations, the Yumen Petroleum Administration also adopted methods such as short-term advanced studies, on-the-job training, and school training to prepare technical forces for a sustained leap forward in production next year.

    扩大油田寸土不让　增产原油斤两不少　完成计划分秒必争
    玉门油矿一手抓生产一手抓准备
    本报兰州17日电　玉门石油管理局在狠抓当前原油生产的同时，大抓明年的生产准备工作。
    为了千方百计增产石油，这个局的党委早在6月底，就提出了“为扩大油田寸土不让，为增产原油斤两不少，为提前完成计划分秒必争”的战斗口号。一方面集中优势兵力大搞采油；一方面采取四项主要措施，积极为明年生产作准备，迎接明年石油生产的持续跃进。
    实现明年原油生产持续跃进的一项重要措施，是迅速找到新油田。为此，成立了勘探指挥部，大力进行对重点地区的勘探工作。目前这一工作已获得了显著成果。为了尽量往前赶，将明年的部分工作提前到今年冬天作好准备，这个局还有十多个勘探队在野外坚持冬季施工，以加快勘探工作的进度。另外这个局还安排了一定的力量，加强原有油田的探边工作，进一步扩大了油田面积，对完成明年原油生产计划提供了有力的保证。
    保证明年生产持续跃进的另一项重要措施，是全面推广对解决生产关键起直接作用的技术措施和先进经验。今年，玉门石油管理局通过技术革新和技术革命运动，使数千名工人摆脱了繁重的手工操作，74％的油井推广了新技术。为了进一步推广技术革命的成果，最近两个月来，这个局所属厂、处、公司紧密结合当前生产和明年准备工作，在党委的领导下，采用三结合的办法，按采油、钻井、炼油、机械制造、基本建设等不同工种，对技术革命的成果，又进一步作了集中的整理、审查和鉴定，总结出了四百二十一项技术措施和先进经验，其中重大的先进经验有一百一十五项。鸭儿峡油田六号油井，过去每月要检修一次泵，推广新技术后，检修油泵时间可以延长到三个月，原油日产量由原来的十三吨提高到二十吨左右。明年，普遍推广这个经验后，全局就可以增产成千上万吨原油。
    保证明年生产跃进的第三项措施，是自力更生，及早动手，努力发展小型原材料工业，大搞综合利用和多种经营。到目前为止，玉门石油管理局已经办起三十多个“二群”材料厂，其中钢、铁、水泥、电焊条等已开始成批生产。精制油品使用的硫酸、采油和防井上必需的氢氟酸等，现已做到自给或部分自给。关于明年工业发展所需要的机械设备，也作了统一安排。
    玉门石油管理局在做好上述各项准备的同时，各单位还采取短期进修、岗位培训、学校培养等办法，为明年生产持续跃进准备技术力量。
