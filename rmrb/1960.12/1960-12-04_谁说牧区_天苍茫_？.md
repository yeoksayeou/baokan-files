Who Says Pastoral Areas are "Boundless and Desolate"?

\tZheng Boquan

\tThe pasture is boundless with beautiful scenery,
\tRed, purple, yellow, and blue, a fragrant array of flowers.
\tYurts dotted like stars on a chessboard,
\tEverywhere now feels like home.

\tTen thousand miles of clear sky, white clouds floating,
\tGrass waves rise and fall like a sea tide.
\tHerds like boats chasing the waves,
\tIn the distance, a lasso pole resembles a mast.

\tThe sun shines brightly, intoxicatingly,
\tThe air is fresh and free from dust.
\tCows and sheep, mothers and offspring, respond to each other,
\tShepherds sing the praises of the earth's spring.

\tScenery like a painting, comparable to southern China,
\tStrong and robust, yet gentle and beautiful.
\tThe people's commune leads to paradise,
\tWho says pastoral areas are "boundless and desolate"?

    谁说牧区“天苍茫”？
    郑伯权牧场无垠好风光，红紫黄蓝百花香，星点棋布蒙古包，而今到处是家乡。万里晴空白云飘，草浪起伏似海潮，畜群如舟逐浪进，遥望套杆一桅梢。阳光明媚欲醉人，空气清香不染尘，牛羊母仔相呼应，牧人高歌大地春。景色如画赛江南，刚健柔美可比肩，人民公社通天堂，谁说牧区“天苍茫”？
