Produce as Much Coal as Possible, Transport as Much Coal as Possible
Beijing Railway Bureau Concentrates Efforts to Maintain High Efficiency in Coal Transportation

    (Our report) Under the guidance of the principle of "concentrating forces and ensuring key points," the Beijing Railway Bureau is actively transporting coal. For several consecutive months, the volume of coal transported has been continuously increasing, ensuring that the five major coal mines within the bureau's management scope—Kailuan, Fengfeng, Jingxi, Jingxing, and Xinglong—produce as much coal as they can and transport as much coal as they produce. In the first half of December, the average daily coal transportation volume increased by another 67 train cars compared to the second half of November, and at the same time, more than 68,000 tons of stockpiled coal were transported out, powerfully supporting the production of key iron and steel enterprises nationwide.

    The Beijing Railway Bureau's coal transportation volume this year accounts for 41% of the total number of cars loaded by the bureau, equivalent to one-sixth of the national railway coal transportation volume. The vast majority of this coal is supplied to key iron and steel enterprises such as Anshan Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, Baotou Iron and Steel, and Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel for production.

    In order to organize high-efficiency transportation, ensure more and faster coal transportation, and promote increased iron and steel production, the Beijing Railway Bureau has established a strong and unified command headquarters to centrally lead and coordinate coal transportation work. Subordinate railway offices and stations have also established joint offices with local coal mines, establishing corresponding connections at each level to closely cooperate in coal transportation. Each month, the goods to be shipped are prioritized according to their importance and urgency, with coal and coke being listed as the most important and urgent goods. Then, from the bureau, offices, and stations to each locomotive, daily coal transportation plans are formulated. In coal transportation, the bureau's employees have displayed tremendous enthusiasm.

    Currently, the Beijing Railway Office has completed its annual coal transportation plan 18 days ahead of schedule. As of December 28, it had transported 340,000 tons more raw coal than the state plan. The total coal transportation volume of the entire railway bureau has increased by 30.1% compared to last year.

    产多少煤　运多少煤
    北京铁路局集中力量保持运煤高效率
    本报讯　北京铁路局在“集中力量、保证重点”的方针指导下，积极运送煤炭，连续几个月煤炭运输量不断增长，保证了全局管理范围内的开滦、峰峰、京西、井陉、兴隆五大煤矿产多少煤、运多少煤。12月上半月平均每天运煤量又比11月下半月增加六十七车，同时运出六万八千多吨存煤，有力地支援了全国重点钢铁企业的生产。
    北京铁路局今年的运煤量占全局总装车数的41％，相当于全国铁路运煤量的六分之一。这些煤炭绝大部分都是供应给鞍钢、武钢、包钢、石钢等重点钢铁企业生产用的。
    为组织高效率运输，确保多运快运煤炭，促进钢铁增产，北京铁路局建立强有力的统一指挥部，集中领导和统筹安排运煤工作。所属各铁路办事处、各个车站，也分别和当地的煤矿成立联合办公室，层层对口挂钩，紧密协作运煤。每月对托运物资分别轻重缓急进行排队，把煤和焦炭列为重中之重、急中之急的物资，然后从局、办事处、车站到每台机车都制订出运煤日计划。在运煤中，全局职工发挥了极大的干劲。
    目前，北京铁路办事处已经提前十八天完成全年运煤计划，到12月28日止，比国家计划多运了三十四万吨原煤。全铁路局运煤总量比去年增加30.1％。
