Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 4th. The Cuban Revolutionary Government Economic Delegation, led by Major Guevara, President of the National Bank of Cuba, accompanied by Han Xiangdou, the Minister of Finance of North Korea, and General Xu Fengxue, Director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, visited Pyongyang and its vicinity on the 2nd and 3rd. They left Pyongyang by train on the evening of the 3rd to visit Hamhung.

On the afternoon of the 2nd, Major Guevara and other distinguished Cuban guests visited the Korean Fatherland Liberation War Memorial Hall with great interest. During the visit, Major Guevara repeatedly expressed his admiration and respect for the victory of the Korean people, and ridiculed and despised the failure of American imperialism's aggression against Korea. After the visit, Major Guevara wrote in the memorial hall's book of thoughts that the memorial hall showed the world's people the honor of the Korean people in striving for freedom and the fierce and brutal nature of imperialism. The memorial hall particularly shows us Cubans what methods we should use to stop imperialism when it invades our country, and how a united people can resist aggression.

On the morning of the 3rd, the delegation visited the Huanghai Iron and Steel Works, currently the largest iron and steel industrial base in North Korea. When Guevara and other Cuban guests arrived at this steel plant located in Songlim City, Huanghai North Road, thousands of workers waved the national flags of North Korea and Cuba and bouquets, repeatedly shouting the slogan "Yes to Cuba, no to the Yankees," warmly welcoming the Cuban guests. The welcoming crowd formed a welcoming queue about one mile long on both sides of the road leading to the factory gate, and the band played the "July 26th" Movement song. Kim Bong-shik, the factory's Labor Party Committee Secretary, told Major Guevara that all the workers in the factory actively support the Cuban people's struggle against American imperialism. Although North Korea and Cuba are thousands of miles apart, the hearts of the two peoples are connected.

Major Guevara and other Cuban guests, led by Kim Hyung-sam, the factory director, visited the factory's magnificent blast furnace, steelmaking workshop, coking workshop, and rolling mill.

That afternoon, the delegation also visited the Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition Hall in Pyongyang.

After the visit, Major Guevara left an inscription in the exhibition hall's book of thoughts, which read that the Korean people are invincible and they will surely achieve peaceful reunification. The South Korean people will one day understand the truth, and the truth cannot be blocked by a line or artificial obstacles.

    古巴政府经济代表团
    继续在朝鲜各地参观访问
    据新华社平壤4日电　由古巴国家银行行长格瓦拉少校率领的古巴革命政府经济代表团在朝鲜财政相韩相斗和朝鲜人民军总政治局局长许凤学上将的陪同下，于2、3两日在平壤和平壤附近参观访问后，已于3日晚离开平壤乘火车前往咸兴访问。
    格瓦拉少校等古巴贵宾2日下午怀着极大的兴趣，参观了朝鲜祖国解放战争纪念馆。参观过程中，格瓦拉少校不断对朝鲜人民的胜利表示赞许和敬佩，并嘲笑和蔑视美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的失败。参观后，格瓦拉少校在纪念馆的感想簿上写道，纪念馆向世界人民显示了朝鲜人民争取自由的荣誉和帝国主义凶恶残暴的本质。纪念馆特别向我们古巴人表明了当帝国主义对我们国家进行侵略的时候，我们应该用什么方法来阻挡它，一个团结起来的人民能够怎样来抵抗侵略。
    3日上午代表团参观了目前朝鲜最大的钢铁工业基地——黄海制铁所。当格瓦拉等古巴贵宾到达这个位于黄海北道松林市的钢铁厂时，数千名工人拿着朝古两国国旗和花束，连声高呼“要古巴，不要美国佬”的口号，热烈欢迎古巴客人。欢迎群众在通往工厂大门的道路两旁，排成了约一里多长的夹道欢迎的队列，乐队奏着“七·二六”运动之歌。这个工厂的劳动党委员长金邦植对格瓦拉少校说，全厂的工人都积极支持古巴人民反对美帝国主义的斗争。朝古两国虽然相隔万里，但两国人民的心是相连在一起的。
    格瓦拉少校等古巴客人，在工厂厂长金衡三的引导下参观了工厂的宏伟的高炉、炼钢车间、炼焦车间、轧钢车间等。
    当天下午，代表团在平壤还参观了工农业展览馆。
    格瓦拉少校参观后在展览馆的感想簿上留下了题词，题词写道，朝鲜人民是不可征服的，他们一定能实现和平统一。南朝鲜人民总有一天会了解真相，真理不是用一条线或人为的障碍所能够阻挡得住的。
