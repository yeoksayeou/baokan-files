    Promoting Common Economic Prosperity and Ensuring Rapid Production Growth
    Economic Cooperation Between Brotherly Countries of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and East Germany is Increasingly Strengthened
    (Reported by this newspaper) Czechoslovakia is actively strengthening economic cooperation with various socialist countries. In the recently passed Czechoslovak Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965) bill, specific plans were made for developing economic cooperation with brotherly countries.
    Economic cooperation with brotherly countries plays an important role in accelerating Czechoslovakia's production development. For example, the iron ore, petroleum, and non-ferrous metals supplied by the Soviet Union will ensure the smooth development of Czechoslovakia's metallurgical industry, machinery manufacturing industry, and chemical industry. Modern machinery imported from the Soviet Union will contribute to the growth of production in a series of important industrial sectors.
    In addition, Romania will supply Czechoslovakia with the heavy oil necessary for its national economy, Bulgaria, Poland, and Romania will supply lead and zinc, and the German Democratic Republic will supply raw materials for the chemical industry.
    Czechoslovakia will contribute its own resources and technology to the economic development of the socialist camp. For example, an agreement was signed based on the recommendation of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance: Czechoslovakia will provide a loan of 250 million rubles to help Poland develop anthracite coal mining and will provide some equipment for mining and sulfur production. In addition, it will supply other brotherly countries with coal, coke, and pig iron.
    Czechoslovakia is expanding the production of power equipment, forging and pressing equipment, rolling equipment, electric locomotives, and metal-cutting machine tools to meet the needs of various brotherly countries.
    Due to the development of economic cooperation, the trade volume between Czechoslovakia and brotherly countries will further expand. It is expected that during the Third Five-Year Plan, its trade volume with other European socialist countries will increase by 50%.
    (Reported by this newspaper) Poland's economic cooperation with various brotherly countries is expanding daily. Since the beginning of this year, Poland has signed long-term trade agreements with many brotherly countries from 1961 to 1965. According to the agreements, the trade volume between each other will achieve significant growth.
    By 1965, the trade volume between Poland and the member states of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance will increase by 37.1% compared to the expected trade volume this year.
    In the next five years, Poland will provide more machinery, equipment, and transportation vehicles to other socialist countries. The export value of these products in 1965 will increase by approximately 76% compared to the present.
    Expanding economic cooperation with brotherly countries is of great significance for promoting Poland's economic prosperity and vigorous development. First of all, this guarantees a stable foreign market for Polish industrial products, which will accelerate industrial development. In particular, the machinery manufacturing industry will further expand production due to export needs. The main products include complete sets of industrial equipment for producing sugar refineries, cement factories, and coal washing plants. Secondly, through trade agreements, Poland will obtain reliable raw materials from brotherly countries. Most of the raw materials needed by Poland, such as cotton, iron ore, petroleum, nickel, aluminum, etc., are supplied by other socialist countries. Using imported materials, Poland will build and expand many industrial enterprises, such as the construction of the Turów giant power station and the Płock refinery, and the expansion of the Turów lignite mine and the Lenin Metallurgical Combine.

    促进经济共同繁荣　保证生产迅速增长
    捷波同兄弟国家经济合作日益加强
    本报讯　捷克斯洛伐克积极加强同各社会主义国家的经济合作。在最近通过的捷克斯洛伐克第三个五年计划（1961—1965年）法案中，作出了同兄弟国家发展经济合作的具体规划。
    同兄弟国家的经济合作，对于加速捷克斯洛伐克的生产发展有重要作用。例如，苏联供给的铁矿砂、石油和有色金属将保证捷克斯洛伐克冶金工业、机械制造工业和化学工业顺利的发展。从苏联进口的现代化机器将有助于一系列重要工业部门生产的增长。
    此外，罗马尼亚将供应捷克斯洛伐克国民经济所必需的重油，保加利亚、波兰和罗马尼亚将供应铅和锌，德意志民主共和国将供应化学工业原料。
    捷克斯洛伐克将以自己的资源和技术对社会主义阵营经济的发展作出贡献。例如，根据经济互助委员会的建议签订了一项协定：捷克斯洛伐克将提供二亿五千万卢布的贷款帮助波兰发展无烟煤的开采，并将提供开采和生产硫磺的一部分设备。此外，它还将以煤、焦炭和铸铁来供应其他兄弟国家。
    捷克斯洛伐克正在扩大动力设备、锻冶、锻压和压延设备、电力机车和金属切削机床等方面的生产，以供应各兄弟国家的需要。
    由于经济合作的发展，捷克斯洛伐克同兄弟国家的贸易额将进一步扩大。预计在第三个五年计划期间，它同欧洲其他社会主义国家的贸易量将增加50％。
    本报讯　波兰同各兄弟国家的经济合作正在日益扩大。今年以来，波兰同许多兄弟国家签订了从1961年到1965年的长期贸易协定，根据协定，彼此的贸易额将获得显著的增长。
    到1965年时，波兰同经济互助委员会成员国之间的贸易额将比今年预计的贸易额增加37.1％。
    在未来五年内，波兰将向其他社会主义国家提供更多的机器设备和交通工具。1965年这些产品的出口额将比目前增加约76％。
    同兄弟国家扩大经济合作，对于促进波兰经济繁荣高涨具有重要的意义。首先，这保证了波兰工业品的稳定的国外市场，从而将加速工业的发展。特别是机械制造工业，由于出口的需要，生产将进一步扩大。其中主要的有生产制糖厂、水泥工厂、洗煤工厂等的成套工业设备。其次，通过贸易协定，波兰将从兄弟国家获得可靠的原料。波兰所需要的大部分原料如棉花、铁矿砂、石油、镍、铝等都是由其他社会主义国家供应的。利用进口物资，波兰将兴建和扩建许多工业企业，如兴建图鲁夫巨型发电站和普沃茨克炼油厂，扩建图鲁夫褐煤矿和列宁冶金联合企业等。
