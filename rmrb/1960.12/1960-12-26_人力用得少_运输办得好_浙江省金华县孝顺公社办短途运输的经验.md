Less Manpower, Better Transportation
    -- The Experience of Xiaoshun People's Commune, Jinhua County, Zhejiang Province, in Handling Short-Distance Transportation
    By Our Reporter Cheng Min
    Xiaoshun People's Commune, Jinhua County, is located in the semi-mountainous area of central Zhejiang, and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway passes through it. This commune mainly produces grain, but also has a considerable abundance of cotton, timber, charcoal, fruit, and other products. Before communization, these materials were mainly transported by manual labor, occupying up to one-third of the labor force. After communization, with the development of industrial and agricultural production, the volume of transport increased year by year. The entire commune transports out more than 40,000 tons of agricultural and sideline products and transports in means of production and consumer goods throughout the year. The commune once organized a professional transportation team of 217 people to undertake transportation tasks. In 1959, a transportation management station was established to manage the commune's transportation business under the leadership of the commune's Party committee.
    In line with the spirit of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, the professional transportation team of this commune recently saved 41% of its manpower to support the front line of agricultural production; at the same time, production teams developed a part-time transportation force that engaged in both agriculture and transportation, according to their needs. After this adjustment, a group of strong laborers was added to agricultural production, and the transportation tasks were completed even better. The monthly output per vehicle of the professional transportation team reached more than 200 ton-kilometers, creating a new record that had never been achieved before. Goods are shipped as soon as they arrive, with no backlog.
    Establishing the Idea of Supporting Agricultural Production, Striving to Reduce Manpower and Increase Production
    In September of this year, all the staff of the Xiaoshun People's Commune Transportation Management Station, under the leadership of the commune's Party committee, earnestly studied the documents on vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, and further established the idea that the national economy should be based on agriculture. They actively requested to support the front line of agricultural production. The staff found shortcuts, tapped potential, and, focusing on the key to production, put forward many rationalization proposals that could improve transportation efficiency and save labor, striving to reduce manpower and increase production.
    After 89 people were transferred from the station to support the front line of agricultural production, labor emulation campaigns were launched comprehensively between work teams and between individuals, comparing enthusiasm, cleverness, and mutual assistance. The youth shock brigade put forward the conditions of "everyone reaching one top two, and the whole class achieving full red" and challenged other work teams. Workers in the seventh work team, which previously had a lower volume of transport, also actively responded to the challenge. After two months of back-and-forth competition in October and November, the average monthly output of the seventh work team increased to 205 tons, a 10% increase compared to September, and the volume of transport exceeded that of the youth team. The youth team also achieved full red. Driven by the mass labor emulation campaign, the volume of transport of various vehicles such as wheelbarrows and oxcarts throughout the station has generally increased since October, and the turnover rate has generally accelerated. 20% of the wheelbarrows with lower transport volume have also caught up with the advanced level one after another.
The Combination of the Commune's Professional Transportation Team and the Production Team's Part-time Transportation Team
    The commune's professional transportation team and the production team's part-time transportation team are closely combined to jointly complete transportation tasks, which not only saves labor for transportation but also strengthens the transportation force.
    From the perspective of this commune, the establishment of a lean and efficient professional transportation team by the commune has the following functions: First, it can promptly transport large quantities of key materials needed for industrial and agricultural production, and serve as a hub for the collection and distribution of materials on the main line; second, it is convenient to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, and help the transportation teams of various production teams to innovate technology and improve labor efficiency; third, it can carry out regular work such as repairing bridges and roads throughout the commune; fourth, it can increase the commune's accumulation.
    The establishment of part-time transportation teams by various production teams, based on the principle of focusing on farming during busy seasons and transportation during slack seasons, mainly serving agriculture, and working together with the commune's professional transportation team to jointly complete transportation tasks, is beneficial to both agricultural production and transportation. First, the part-time transportation team of the production team undertakes the transportation tasks of various scattered materials, so that the professional transportation team can concentrate its efforts to ensure key materials, and achieve that both key materials and general materials can be transported as soon as they are entrusted, without backlog. The part-time transportation team can also help the professional team transport batches of materials during slack seasons. Second, the production team can save a lot of labor for field transportation after establishing a transportation team. After the Xietang Production Team established a transportation team, it only took ten days in October to use wheelbarrows to transport all of more than 2,000 dan of pond mud and pig manure to the fields, which increased work efficiency by five times compared with manual carrying, and the entire team saved more than 500 workdays. Third, the production team can increase its income. The transportation income of the Xietang Production Team accounts for about 10% of the total agricultural income, which increases production funds for the production team.
    The Transportation Management Station of this commune, under the leadership of the commune's Party committee, uniformly arranges important transportation work related to the entire commune. They have established a quarterly and monthly consignment plan system, and reasonably arrange transportation according to the principle of ensuring key materials and taking into account general materials. They are also responsible for unifying freight rates in accordance with state regulations. In this way, it can be ensured that key materials and general materials are properly arranged, without causing confusion, and labor can be saved. The Transportation Management Station also helps production teams to do a good job in transportation from the aspects of technology and equipment.
    Innovate Technology in Many Ways, Load Cleverly and Carry More, and Accelerate Transportation Speed
    In order to reduce manpower and increase production, the Party branch of the Xiaoshun People's Commune Transportation Management Station launched a mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement among transportation workers.
    After repeated research, the workers of the Xing Zhidao wheelbarrow work team improved the loading method and lengthened the rope, which not only increased the volume of transport but also reduced the load on the workers by about 30%; this method was immediately promoted in various work teams. The workers carried out operation innovations aimed at key problems such as crossing ridges and ditches, which were the most difficult for pulling carts. From Xietang to Yuandong, it used to be possible to transport goods only once a day across mountains and ridges, but now it is possible to transport them twice, and it is also less strenuous than before.
    When loading and transporting some difficult-to-load, lightweight goods and liquid materials, the workers adopted many clever loading methods to increase the volume of transport. Once, one hundred double-sized coir beds had to be transported from Fucun to the railway station fifteen miles away. The dispatcher originally planned to send a work team to complete the task in two days; after the seventh work team, known as the "clever loading work team," accepted the task, the work team leader, Communist Party member Liu Shou Rong, and all the workers studied together, added horizontal bars to the cart to tie them, and increased the number of beds loaded on one cart from four to ten. One hundred coir beds were transported in half a day.
    The staff improved the transportation scheduling work and route arrangement, and tried to be careful and economical, without wasting labor. Long-distance transportation and short-distance transportation are reasonably arranged in terms of time, and the source of goods is carefully arranged at the same time, carrying goods back and forth as much as possible, and trying not to leave empty carts. They also use wheelbarrows and oxcarts in relays to transport goods in stages according to the route conditions, which saves labor and accelerates transportation speed.
    Establish and Improve Management Systems to Ensure Regular High Production
    The transportation team of the Xiaoshun People's Commune has gradually established a set of management systems that can improve transportation efficiency and promote regular high production. In terms of tools, the system of guaranteeing the service life and guaranteeing safekeeping is implemented; for the oxen of oxcarts, the system of assigning people to raise them, assigning vehicles, assigning volume of transport, assigning routes, and assigning feed is implemented.
    These systems are jointly formulated and jointly observed by the staff, ensuring the improvement of transportation efficiency. For example, after the tool management system was implemented, the workers took great care of the tools, repaired them themselves at any time, and checked, repaired, and oiled them diligently in the morning and evening, so that minor repairs did not enter the factory. The carrying capacity of vehicles has generally increased by 40% compared with the past, while the vehicle loss rate has decreased compared with the past.

    人力用得少　运输办得好
    ——浙江省金华县孝顺公社办短途运输的经验
    本报记者　程敏
    金华县孝顺公社位于浙中半山区，浙赣铁路经过这里。这个社以粮食生产为主，棉花、木材、木炭、水果等产品也相当丰富。公社化以前，这些物资主要由人工运输，最多时要占用三分之一的劳动力。公社化以后，随着工农业生产的发展，运量逐年增加。全公社一年四季运出的农副产品和运入的生产资料和生活资料，约有四万多吨。公社曾组织了二百一十七人的专业运输队，担负运输任务。1959年成立了交通运输管理站，在公社党委领导下管理全社运输事业。
    根据大办农业、大办粮食的精神，这个公社的专业运输队不久以前节约出41％的人力，支援了农业生产第一线；同时，生产队根据需要发展了一部分一面搞农业一面搞运输的副业运输队伍。经过这一调整，农业生产方面增加了一批强劳动力，而运输任务完成得更好。专业运输队单车月产达到二百吨公里以上，创造了过去没有过的新纪录。物资一到，马上起运，没有积压现象。
    确立支援农业生产的思想，力争减人增产
    今年9月，孝顺公社交通运输管理站全体职工在公社党委领导下，认真学习了关于大办农业、大办粮食的文件，进一步树立了国民经济以农业为基础的思想，纷纷要求支援农业生产第一线。职工们找窍门、挖潜力，针对生产关键，提出了许多可以提高运输效率，节约劳动力的合理化建议，力争减人又增产。
    全站抽调出八十九人支援农业生产第一线以后，工班与工班，个人与个人全面开展了比干劲、比巧干、比互助的劳动竞赛。青年突击班提出“人人达到一顶两，全班做到满堂红”的条件，向各工班挑战。原来运量较低的第七工班的工人也积极应战。经过10、11两个月的你追我赶，第七工班平均月产量提高到二百零五吨，比9月份提高10％，运量超过了青年班。青年班也实现了满堂红。在群众性劳动竞赛的推动下，10月份以来，全站独轮手车、牛拉车等各种车辆的运量普遍提高，周转速度普遍加快。20％的运量较低的手车，也先后赶上了先进水平。公社专业运输队和生产队的副业运输队相结合
    公社专业运输队和生产队的副业运输队紧密结合，共同完成运输任务，既节约了用于运输的劳动力，又加强了运输力量。
    从这个公社的情况来看，公社建立一支精干的专业运输队，有以下作用：一、可以及时调运工农业生产需要的大批重点物资，为干线集散物资；二、便于开展技术革新和技术革命运动，帮助各生产队的运输队革新技术，提高劳动效率；三、可以在全公社内进行经常性的修桥铺路等工作；四、可以增加公社的积累。
    各个生产队建立副业运输队，根据农忙务农，农闲搞运输，为农业服务为主的原则，和公社的专业运输队一起共同完成运输任务，对于农业生产、对于运输都有好处。一、生产队的副业运输队担负了各种零星物资的运输任务，使专业运输队可以集中力量保证重点，做到重点物资和一般物资都能随托随运，不积压。副业运输队在农闲时还可以帮助专业队运输成批物资。二、生产队有了运输队，可以节约大量用于田间运输的劳动力。鞋塘生产队建立运输队以后，10月份只花十天时间就用手车把二千多担塘泥和猪粪全部运到田间，比用人工挑提高工效五倍，全队节约了五百多个劳动日。三、生产队可以增加收入。鞋塘生产队运输收入约占农业总收入的10％左右，给生产队增加了生产资金。
    这个公社的交通运输管理站在公社党委领导下统一安排关系全社的重要运输工作。他们建立了季度和月度托运计划制度，根据保证重点、兼顾一般的原则，合理安排运输。他们还负责按照国家规定统一运价。这样，可以保证重点物资和一般物资妥善安排，不至于发生混乱，又能节省劳力。交通运输管理站还从技术、设备等方面帮助生产队搞好运输。
    多方革新技术，巧装多载，加快运输速度
    孝顺人民公社交通运输管理站的党支部为了实现减人增产，发动运输工人开展了群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动。
    独轮车邢知道工班的工人经过多次研究，改进了装货方法，放长了绳子，不仅可以增加运量，而且使工人的负重量减轻30％左右；这一办法立即在各个工班推广开来。工人们针对拉车最困难的过岭、过沟等关键问题，大搞操作革新。从鞋塘到源东翻山过岭，过去一天只能运一次货，现在能运两次，而且比过去省力。
    工人在装运一些难装的体轻货和液体物资时，采取许多巧装的办法，提高运量。有一次，有一百张双人棕床要从傅村运到十五里路外的火车站，调度员原计划派一个工班用两天运完；被人们称为“巧装工班”的第七工班接受这项任务以后，工班长、共产党员柳守荣和全班工人一起研究，在车上加横棍捆绑，一部车由装四张增加到装十张，一百张棕床半天就运完了。
    职工们改进了运输调度工作和线路安排，尽量做到精打细算，不浪费劳动力。远路运输和近路运输在时间上作合理搭配，同时周密安排货源，来回带货，尽量不放空车。他们还根据线路情况，分段用手车、牛拉车接力运输，既省劳力又加快了运输速度。
    建立和健全管理制度，保证经常高产
    孝顺人民公社的运输队逐步建立了一套能够提高运输效率、促进经常高产的管理制度。在工具方面，实行包使用年限，包保管等；对牛拉车的牛，实行定人饲养，定车辆，定运量，定路程，定饲料等。
    这些制度由职工共同制订，共同遵守，保证了运输效率的提高。如实行工具管理制度以后，工人对工具十分爱护，自己随时整修，早晚勤检查，勤修理，勤加油，做到小修不进厂。车辆载重量普遍比过去提高40％，而车子损耗率却比过去下降了。
