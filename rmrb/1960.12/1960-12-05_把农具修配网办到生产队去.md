The experience of the Jiangdu County, Jiangsu Province, and its commune industrial departments in helping production brigades (in some places called production teams) establish farm implement repair stations is worth paying attention to.

Many people's communes have their own farm implement manufacturing or repair factories. However, at present, agricultural production is mainly manual labor, and the most widely used are small and medium-sized simple iron and wooden farm implements. There are many varieties and different specifications. With the expansion of cultivated area and multiple cropping area, and with the improvement of the degree of intensive cultivation, the demand for farm implement repair and manufacturing is increasing day by day. It is not enough to rely solely on a farm implement factory in the county or commune. Helping production teams establish farm implement repair stations can better meet the requirements of agricultural production and ensure that medium and small farm implements are repaired in a timely manner.

Since the farm implement repair station belongs to the production team and is under the unified command of the production team, the production team can uniformly arrange, manage, and conduct economic accounting for agricultural production and farm implement repair work. After this team-based farm implement repair network is established, it not only has the advantages of adapting to local conditions and facilitating the masses, but also can strengthen and maintain the ownership of the production team from both top-down and bottom-up aspects, and further promote the development of the team's economy.

    把农具修配网办到生产队去
    江苏江都县、社工业部门，帮助生产大队（有的地方叫生产队）兴办农具修配站的经验值得重视。
    不少人民公社都有了自己的农具制造或修理厂。但是目前农业生产主要是手工操作，普遍的大量使用的还是中小型的简易铁木农具。它们的品种繁多，规格不一。随着耕作面积和复种面积的扩大，随着精耕细作程度的提高，农具修配和制造的需要量日益增多，只依靠县的或公社的一个农具厂是不行的。帮助生产队建立农具修配站，就可以更好地满足农业生产的要求，使中、小型农具及时地得到修理。
    由于农具修配站属于生产队所有，由生产队统一指挥，生产队便可以把农业生产和农具修配工作给以统一安排，统一经营管理，进行经济核算。这种以队为基础的农具修配网兴办起来以后，不但具有因地制宜、方便群众的优点，而且还能从上下两个方面加强和维护生产队所有制，进一步促进队有经济的发展。
