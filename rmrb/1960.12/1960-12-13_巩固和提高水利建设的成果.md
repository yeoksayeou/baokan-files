Consolidating and Improving the Achievements of Water Conservancy Construction

With the progress of the entire socialist construction and agricultural technical transformation, China's water conservancy construction has entered a new period of consolidation and improvement. The hallmark of this new period is the further systematization of water conservancy projects and the further mechanization and semi-mechanization of water conservancy facilities.

In recent years, China's water conservancy construction, as an extremely important component of the entire socialist construction, has launched an unprecedented large-scale mass movement under the glorious banner of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, achieving unprecedented brilliant achievements. The great achievements of water conservancy construction, in an important aspect, demonstrated the unparalleled superiority of the rural People's Communes and enhanced the strength of the Chinese people in their struggle against nature. Last year and this year, vast areas of China suffered continuous serious natural disasters that were rare or unseen for decades, but the proportion of affected areas was greatly reduced compared to the past. The cultivated land area that suffered a production reduction of more than 30% due to disasters this year accounted for only one-third of the disaster-affected area. Without the achievements of large-scale water conservancy construction in recent years, it would be unimaginable what would have happened in the face of two consecutive years of major disasters!

The great achievements of water conservancy construction have created favorable material conditions for the sustained leap forward in China's agricultural production in the future. The potential of existing water conservancy projects has not yet been fully exploited. We must cherish all the achievements of large-scale water conservancy construction in recent years, and we must consolidate the great victory of large-scale water conservancy construction in recent years, so that future water conservancy construction can improve on the original basis and play a greater role in achieving a bumper agricultural harvest next year. After rapidly developing a batch of projects, we must immediately consolidate and improve a batch; after consolidating and improving, we will develop again, and after developing, we will consolidate and improve again. This is the objective law of development of all things. In the entire process of realizing agricultural water conservancy in China, we must be good at grasping the timing and making our actions conform to this law. For water conservancy construction itself, and for the promotion of agricultural production by water conservancy construction, this is the road of more, faster, better, and more economical results.

According to predictions, a considerable area of China may still encounter spring and summer droughts next year. We must have sufficient material and mental preparation for this, start from the worst-case scenario, and strive for the best results. To ensure that we can achieve a bumper harvest in the summer and even the whole year of next year, even if we continue to suffer from serious natural disasters, how should we carry out this preparation? It should be recognized that the number of water conservancy projects built in the past few years is already quite considerable. For disaster prevention and increased production next year, what is urgently needed is not to start new projects, but to complete, continue, and repair existing water conservancy projects. In particular, it is important to complete supporting facilities. Whether water conservancy projects can give full play to their role mainly depends on whether the projects have been systematized and whether they have been fully equipped. Having a reservoir also requires canals, having main canals also requires branch canals and capillary canals, and having all kinds of canals also requires leveling the land. After the earth and stone works are completed, there must also be mechanical equipment and irrigation and drainage tools. If one link is missing in a series of projects, the entire project will not be able to play its role or will not be able to play its role fully. Although some projects do not lack any links, the diameters are not correct, they are not connected, or the quality of some sections is not good, which will greatly hinder the potential of the project. These situations are unavoidable during the stage of great development, due to lack of experience or restrictions of various objective conditions. This is also the inevitable process of development from rough to refined and from low-level to high-level.

In addition to supporting facilities, the continuation of unfinished projects and the maintenance and management of existing projects should also be properly arranged this winter and next spring. In particular, we must focus on dangerous projects and projects that can be used for winter and spring irrigation, in order to ensure safety, expand benefits, promote production most quickly, and save labor most effectively. Water conservancy projects that can store water in advance should store water as early and as much as possible under the condition of ensuring safety; all places that need to implement winter irrigation should carry out water storage and irrigation as much as possible under the condition of overall planning. In areas prone to flooding, the inspection, maintenance, reinforcement, and management of flood control and drainage projects should not be ignored. Each region has its current main key points. When arranging the water conservancy construction tasks for this winter and next spring, it is necessary to conduct investigations and research, take into account the overall situation, and seize the main key points according to local conditions and time conditions, and concentrate main forces to fight annihilation wars.

This winter and next spring, the mechanization and semi-mechanization of water conservancy projects and water conservancy facilities should be further promoted. Water conservancy construction teams should be equipped with certain construction machinery, adopt new technologies, and further improve work efficiency. All heavy labor should be mechanized and semi-mechanized as much as possible, or at least improved tools should be used. It is also necessary to universally apply the principles of linear programming in operations research, rationally use terrain, and rationally arrange work, in order to save labor, materials, and land to the greatest extent. Irrigation and drainage machinery should be actively developed, and improved waterwheels are still the main water lifting tool at present, which should be actively manufactured and fully utilized. All localities should also, according to specific conditions, use hydropower to build power stations and hydropower stations as much as possible, to serve agricultural production and welfare undertakings, in order to save labor and fuel.

The labor force required for water conservancy construction this winter and next spring must be arranged on the premise of first satisfying the labor force required for winter and spring agricultural production and sideline production. The labor force used in water conservancy projects can be roughly divided into three parts: one part is a professional mechanical construction team, which has been formed in the water conservancy construction in recent years. At present, it should not only not be expanded, but should also be appropriately streamlined and adjusted, and gradually increase certain mechanical equipment as the backbone force in water conservancy construction. Another part is a migrant worker team that temporarily leaves its original food unit in winter and spring. Because the main task this winter and next spring is to carry out supporting projects, the workload is much smaller than in the past, and people's skills have been improved. They should also try to use machinery and new technologies in construction, so the number of people in this team will be greatly reduced compared to the past few years. The other part is those who do not leave their original food unit at all. Their task is only to level the land and engage in other field projects within their own production team. They should be properly arranged under the principle of being conducive to winter and spring agricultural production and truly combining work and rest. They should also try to improve technical measures, save labor, and improve work efficiency. The labor force used in water conservancy does not need to be rushed all at once. A part can be started first, and preparatory work and a part of the project can be done. When a large amount of manpower is needed, the manpower will be added; and at the end of the project, arrangements should be made to gradually withdraw them. This requires careful calculation in advance and flexible scheduling on a temporary basis.

The allocation of labor from the various production teams and production brigades of the People's Commune to engage in water conservancy construction must be planned comprehensively and arranged properly, and the relevant policies must be strictly and conscientiously implemented. All projects must determine personnel, determine sections, determine tasks, determine time, determine quality, and determine remuneration, and be contracted by temporary professional teams, groups, or the original production teams of the People's Commune. Basically, it should be done which team benefits, which team contributes manpower; the more benefits, the more labor, the less benefits, the less labor. If it is really necessary to transfer the labor force of the production team that does not benefit, it should be democratically consulted, mutually beneficial, equal exchange, and paid according to work. The labor remuneration for water conservancy construction, except for projects that directly benefit in the current year, should be paid by the sponsoring commune and team from their own public accumulation, and should not be calculated and paid from the production income of the current year. When counties and above levels carry out water conservancy and other capital construction, and must transfer labor from the commune, in addition to strictly controlling the number of people according to regulations, the sponsoring unit must also issue the wages that should be paid. Only in this way is it in line with the fundamental system of the People's Commune at the current stage as stipulated by the Party—three-level ownership, with the team as the basis. This is very beneficial to the further consolidation of the People's Commune and the faster development of production and construction.

In terms of living arrangements, the work should also be done better. For the part of the people who need to leave their original food unit, arrangements should be made for the supply of staple and non-staple foods and the location of accommodation on the construction site. Special attention should be paid to planting vegetables on all vacant land near the construction site (including land within the reservoir area that will not be storing water temporarily). This can save transportation capacity and make full use of land, and ensure that people on the construction site can often eat fresh vegetables. The political learning, cultural learning and entertainment activities on the construction site, as well as labor protection, fire safety, and medical and health work should also be properly arranged. For the part of the people who leave their original food unit, the working time should generally not exceed eight hours per day; for the part of the people who do not leave their original food unit at all, the working time should generally not exceed four to five hours per day, and in some areas, it can sometimes be eight hours, depending on the specific situation. In short, it is necessary to ensure that the people participating in water conservancy construction eat well, sleep well, have both work and rest, are high-spirited, and are happy.

The entire situation of large-scale agriculture and large-scale grain production is very favorable, and the enthusiasm of the broad masses to further fight against nature is even higher; at the same time, this year's water conservancy work has already had a strong foundation laid in the past few years, and has entered a new period of consolidating victory and completing supporting facilities. The arrangement of tasks is in line with the overall situation and the requirements of the masses. Although the manpower used in water conservancy this winter and next spring is relatively small, as long as we are good at absorbing and applying past experiences, as long as we further improve leadership methods and promote technological reforms, labor efficiency can be greatly improved. On the premise of ensuring greater victories in winter agricultural and sideline production, and in the better implementation of the principle of combining work and rest, we will certainly be able to achieve new and great victories on the water conservancy front, and create more favorable material conditions for resisting natural disasters and striving for better harvests next year.

    巩固和提高水利建设的成果
    随着整个社会主义建设和农业技术改造的进展，我国的水利建设进入了一个巩固和提高的新时期。这个新的时期的标志，就是水利工程的进一步系统化和水利设施的进一步机械化、半机械化。
    几年来，我国的水利建设，作为整个社会主义建设的一个极其重要的组成部分，在党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉旗帜下，开展了史无前例的大规模的群众运动，取得了史无前例的辉煌的成就。水利建设的伟大成就，在一个重要方面显示了农村人民公社的无比优越性，增强了我国人民同大自然作斗争的力量。去年和今年，我国广大地区连续遭受到几十年没有或少有的严重的自然灾害，而成灾的比例却比过去大为缩小，今年因灾减产三成以上的耕地面积只占受灾面积的三分之一。如果没有几年来大兴水利的成就，遇到连续两年的大灾害，那真是何堪设想！
    水利建设的伟大成就，更为今后我国农业生产的持续跃进创造了有利的物质条件。已有的水利工程的潜力，还远远没有充分发挥出来。我们一定要十分珍视几年来大兴水利的一切成就，一定要巩固几年来大兴水利的伟大胜利，使今后的水利建设在原有的基础上提高一步，使它为明年的农业大丰收发挥更大作用。迅速地发展一批之后，紧接着就要切实地巩固一批、提高一批；巩固了、提高了再发展，发展了再巩固、再提高。这是一切事物发展的客观规律。在实现我国农业水利化的全部过程中，必须善于掌握时机，使我们的行动适合于这样的规律。就水利建设本身来说，就水利建设对于农业生产的促进来说，这都是多快好省的道路。
    根据预测，明年我国相当大的地区仍然可能遭遇春旱、夏旱，我们必须对这一点有足够的物质准备和精神准备，从最坏的情况出发，为争取最好的结果努力。要保证在继续遭受严重的自然灾害的情况下夺取明年夏季以至全年的大丰收。怎样来进行这个准备工作呢？应当看到，过去几年兴修水利工程的数量已经相当可观了，为了明年的防灾、增产，迫切需要的不是举办新的工程，而是对已有的水利工程的配套、续建、维修。特别重要的是配套。水利工程能否充分发挥作用，主要决定于工程是不是实现了系统化，是不是已经配成了套。有了水库还要有渠道，有了干渠还要有支渠和毛渠，各种渠道都有了还要平整土地。土石工程完成了还要有机械设备、排灌工具。一系列工程中，缺少一个环节，整个工程就不能发挥作用或不能充分发挥作用。有些工程虽然各个环节都不缺少，但口径不对，没有衔接起来，或者其中某些段落质量不好，也会大大妨碍工程潜力的发挥。这些情况，在大发展的阶段，在经验不足或者种种客观条件的限制下，是不可避免的。这也是事物发展由粗到精、由低级到高级的必然的过程。
    除了配套之外，对于未完工程的续建和原有工程的维修管理，在今冬明春也要妥善安排。特别要抓紧险工和能够用于冬灌、春灌的工程，以求保证安全，扩大效益，最迅速地促进生产，最有效地节约劳力。能够提前蓄水的水利工程，要在确保安全的条件下尽可能早蓄水、多蓄水；需要实行冬灌的一切地方，要在通盘筹划的条件下尽可能边蓄水、边灌溉。在易受水患的地区，对防洪、排涝工程的检查、维修加固、管理，也不可忽视。每个地区都有当地当前的主要关键，在安排今冬明春的水利建设任务的时候，务必要经过调查研究，统筹全局，因地制宜、因时制宜地抓住主要关键，集中主要力量打歼灭战。
    在今冬明春，要把水利工程和水利设施的机械化、半机械化推进一步。要把水利施工队伍，用一定的施工机械装备起来，采用新的技术，进一步提高工效。一切笨重的劳动，都要力求做到机械化、半机械化，至少也要使用改良工具。还要普遍应用运筹学的线性规划原理，合理利用地形、合理安排工作，以求最大限度地节约人力、物力和土地。排灌机具要积极发展，改良水车仍然是当前主要的提水工具，要积极制造，充分利用。各地还要根据具体条件，尽可能利用水力建立发电站和水力站，为农业生产和生活福利事业服务，以利于节约劳动力，节约燃料。
    今冬明春水利建设所需要的劳动力，必须在首先满足冬春农业生产、副业生产所需要的劳动力的前提下来安排。在水利工程上使用的劳动力，大体上可以分作三个部分：一部分是专业机械施工队伍，这一支队伍已在几年来的水利建设中形成，目前不仅不应再扩大，而且应该适当精简调整，并逐步增加一定的机械设备，作为水利施工中的骨干力量。又一部分是在冬春季节临时脱离原伙食单位的民工队伍，因为今冬明春的主要任务是搞配套工程，工作量比过去小得多，而且人们的技术有所提高，他们在施工中，也要尽量利用机械和新技术，所以这支队伍的人数也就要比过去几年大为减少。再一部分是完全不脱离原伙食单位的，他们的任务只是在本生产小队范围内平整土地和从事其它田间工程，更要在有利于冬春农业生产和切实做到劳逸结合的原则下妥善安排，也要尽量改进技术措施，节约人力，提高工效。用在水利方面的劳动力，也不必一拥而上，可以先上一部分，做好准备工作和一部分工程，到恰好需要较多人力的时候再把人力上足；到工程尾期也要做好安排，逐批抽调下来。这需要事先作好精细的计算，临时又作好灵活的调度。
    从人民公社各个生产队和生产小队抽调劳动力从事水利建设，必须通盘筹划、妥善安排，并且要严格地认真地执行有关的政策。各项工程都要定人员、定地段、定任务、定时间、定质量、定报酬，由临时组成的专业队、组或者由人民公社原来的生产小队包工。基本上应当做到哪个队受益，哪个队出人；受益多的多出工，受益少的少出工。确有必要抽调不受益的生产队的劳动力，应当民主协商，自愿互利，等价交换，按工付酬。水利建设的劳动报酬，除了当年直接受益的工程以外，要由主办的社、队从自己的公共积累中开支，不要从当年的生产收入中计工付酬。县和县以上各级兴办水利和其它基本建设，必须从公社抽调劳动力的时候，除了按规定严格控制人数以外，还必须由主办的单位发给应得的工资。这样做，才符合于党所规定的现阶段人民公社的根本制度——三级所有、队为基础。这对于人民公社的更加巩固和生产建设的更快发展是十分有利的。
    在生活安排方面也要把工作做得更好。对于需要脱离原伙食单位的一部分人，要安排好主副食品供应和工地住宿地点。特别要注意在工地附近利用一切空闲土地（包括水库区域内暂时不会蓄水的土地），大种蔬菜，这既可以节约运输力和充分利用土地，又可以保证在工地上的人们经常吃到新鲜的蔬菜。工地的政治学习、文化学习和娱乐活动，以及劳动保护、安全防火、医疗卫生工作，也要妥善安排。劳动时间，脱离原伙食单位的一部分人，一般每天不要超过八小时；完全不脱离原伙食单位的一部分人，一般每天不要超过四小时到五小时，有些地区有时也可以劳动八小时，看具体情况而定。总之，要保证参加水利建设的人们吃好、睡好，有劳有逸，斗志昂扬，精神愉快。
    大办农业、大办粮食的整个形势十分有利，广大群众进一步同大自然作斗争的积极性更加高涨；同时，今年的水利工作又已经有了过去几年打下的强大的基础，进入了巩固胜利、配套成龙的新时期，任务的安排符合全局的形势和群众的要求。虽然今冬明春用在水利方面的人力比较少了，但是，只要善于吸取和运用过去的经验，只要进一步改进领导方法和推行技术改革，劳动效率就能大大提高。在确保冬季农业和副业生产取得更大胜利的前提下，在更好地贯彻执行劳逸结合的原则的情况下，也一定能在水利战线上取得新的巨大的胜利，为明年抗御自然灾害争取更好收成创造更有利的物质条件。
