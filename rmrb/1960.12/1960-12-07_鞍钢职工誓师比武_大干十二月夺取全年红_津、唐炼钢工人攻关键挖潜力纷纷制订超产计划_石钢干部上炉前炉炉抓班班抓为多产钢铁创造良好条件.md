    This newspaper reports Anshan Iron and Steel Company's broad masses of workers, at a vow-taking and competition radio rally, resoundingly put forward: Resolutely exert full energy, work hard in December, not lacking a single ounce or allowing a single inch of steel to be missed, to complete this year's steel production plan and seize the final victory in steel production.
    Li Dongye, Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee, and Yang Shijie, First Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee, spoke at the meeting. Comrade Yang Shijie said: The current situation is like a ten-thousand-meter race. We have already run nine thousand meters, run very fast and well, and achieved great results. Only a short distance remains ahead. Whether we can reach the finish line better depends on our degree of effort. Then, the competition began. These warriors fighting on the front line of steel production wanted to compete in this final decisive battle in the last month of this year to see who is a hero. Guo Baozhu, the representative of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant, said: We guarantee to exert full energy and skill in this final, to complete the state plan by shift, by day, by ten-day period, by month, and by quantity and quality, and with this condition, we challenge the No. 2 and No. 3 Steelmaking Plants! Han Defeng, the representative of the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant, who had just won the Red Flag for winning the competition among the three major steel plants, immediately stepped onto the stage to accept the challenge, saying: We resolutely want to compete with the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant! We must fully explain the situation and hand over tasks to the masses, conduct extensive propaganda and mobilization, and firmly weld the red flag to No. 2 Steelmaking! The No. 3 Steelmaking Plant was not to be outdone. Ma Yufa, a famous municipal model worker and deputy director, said: Our plant has already launched a heat wave of learning from, catching up with, and surpassing No. 2 Steelmaking, and is determined to seize the red flag. Everyone is comparing themselves with the advanced experience of No. 2 Steelmaking, checking and comparing their thoughts, checking and comparing their energy, and checking and comparing their work. We are determined to over fulfill the annual plan ahead of schedule and move the red flag from No. 2 Steelmaking to No. 3 Steelmaking!
    Representatives from various units of the ironmaking system unanimously expressed their determination to "overcome the severe cold and guarantee iron to protect steel." The workers of the Ironmaking Plant specially wrote their speeches into literary forms and came to the conference to perform. They recited loudly: Blast furnaces are lined up, red waves surge with brilliance, a final decisive battle in the last month, compete to seize iron and protect steel. The representative of Dagushan Mine brought the miners' determination. He said: We guarantee that the daily production level of ore, concentrate, and overburden removal will be comprehensively improved in December, so that the blast furnaces will be full, well-fed, and never get enough!
    "Steel must be made into materials to ensure the completion of this year's steel production tasks ahead of schedule!" This is the voice of rolling steel workers. The representative of the large plant guaranteed: We must adhere to putting politics in command, strengthen enterprise management, eliminate accidents, and further increase the output of steel in the decisive battle of December, and improve the first-grade product rate of section steel to above the state-specified indicators, and excellently complete the important task of supporting the whole country.
    Family members of the staff and workers also sent representatives to the conference to express their determination to arrange the lives of the staff and workers, combining the inside and outside of the factory, and do a good job as "logistical" soldiers in seizing steel with all their strength.
    This newspaper reports that the broad masses of staff and workers on the Tianjin steelmaking front are determined to go all out to the end and seize a complete victory for the whole year. In recent days, the staff and workers of various factories have actively attacked key problems, tapped potential, mustered troops and prepared horses, and carried out the final battle of this year.
    In order to lead the city's steelmaking staff and workers to win the last battle of this year, the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee recently convened a meeting attended by steel plants and relevant units throughout the city to deploy the tasks for December. The Party committees of various steel plants then convened cadre meetings to communicate and discuss, and went to the production front line to convey to the workers on duty, quickly bringing the call of the Provincial Party Committee and the Municipal Party Committee to the broad masses of workers. The leading cadres of Tianjin No. 2 Steel Plant also went to various branch plants to organize night-shift cadres and workers to conduct discussions. As early as late November, Tianjin No. 3 Steel Plant mobilized its staff and workers to carefully calculate and tap potential, and set an overproduction plan to overproduce 5,000 tons of steel for the whole year. Now, the enthusiasm for competition is even greater.
    The staff and workers of various steel plants are in high spirits and full of energy, determined to answer the call of the Party with practical actions. The staff and workers of the No. 3 Steel Plant proposed: "Go all out to the end, and don't stop until we win a complete victory." Each workshop and team specifically formulated an overproduction plan for the decisive battle in December to seize a complete victory for the whole year.
    This newspaper reports that the staff and workers of Tangshan Steel Plant have set off a competitive upsurge of "fighting the last month and completing the annual task ahead of schedule."
    In order to win the battle in December, the Party Committee of Tangshan Steel Plant mobilized all the staff and workers to summarize the experience of the previous steel-grabbing war, and further laid the foundation for the workers' confidence in winning the final victory. On the basis of summarizing experience and improving thinking, all the staff and workers discussed and formulated plans and measures to complete the annual steel production task ahead of schedule. The staff and workers of each team and each type of work focused on the key points of production in their workshops and groups, and carried out a major campaign to tackle key issues. The workers of the converter steelmaking team, aiming at the key problem of the short life of the converter and the long smelting time, generally promoted the management experience of Wang Yiyuan's furnace contracting team and the advanced operation methods of small-angle surface blowing and less lime addition, which generally shortened the smelting time by five or six minutes.
    In the steel-grabbing competition movement, the responsible cadres of the Tangshan Municipal Party Committee and the Tangshan Steel Plant Party Committee personally went to the production site and worked with the staff and workers to break through key issues. They took the good management of the staff and workers' lives as an important measure to complete the annual task ahead of schedule in the major battle in December. The Party Committee Secretary took the lead in specifically grasping the lives of the staff and workers and transferred more than two hundred cadres to enrich the living front.
    This newspaper reports that staff and workers of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company have held rallies and competitions for consecutive days, determined to work hard in the last month of this year to ensure the completion of the state plan ahead of schedule and strive to increase the production of more steel, pig iron, and steel materials for the country.
    Leading cadres, technical cadres, and professional management cadres of various factories and mines under the company continue to go deep into the production front line, implement the shift duty system, grasp every furnace, and grasp every shift, from zero o'clock to twenty-four o'clock, to ensure that key problems do not pass the shift and solve problems in time, creating conditions for continuous leap forward in production.
    The steelmaking workers of the Experimental Factory continue to implement the smelting method that focuses on extending furnace life and achieving more opening, fast smelting, and less blowing loss. They launched a red flag competition for the entire process from brickmaking, furnace repair to steelmaking. The factory's leading cadres also went deep into the steelmaking team, mobilized workers to strictly implement the furnace repairing and air vent measuring systems, adhered to the correct blowing angle, eliminated post-blowing phenomenon, and the average furnace life in recent days has greatly improved, reaching a maximum of fifty-seven furnaces in one day.
    The blast furnace workers of the Ironmaking Plant further implement the methods of fine materials, large wind, and high temperature, and do everything possible to ensure the smooth operation of the furnace conditions.
    The staff and workers of all other auxiliary departments also actively took measures to fully support high steel production. The transportation department further strengthened the loading and unloading force, organized a dragon collaboration competition to seize iron and steel, to ensure the timely supply of raw materials and the transportation of slag and iron pots, ensuring smooth flow of molten iron and high converter production.
