Erhard Reiterates that West Germany Cannot Provide Funds to Help the United States

(Reported by this newspaper) West German Economics Minister Erhard stated in Munich on the 3rd that the idea that West Germany should provide funds to help the United States resolve the dollar crisis is a "ridiculous notion."

Erhard made this statement while speaking to a group of West German Christian Democratic Party members. He believes that the U.S. balance of payments deficit crisis is mainly due to excessive U.S. capital outflow. However, Erhard also mentioned West Germany's "contribution." He said that during the recent West German-American financial talks, West Germany expressed its willingness to provide various funds totaling at least $1.2 billion, including advance debt payments and sharing the military expenses of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

    艾哈德再次表示
    西德不能出钱帮助美国
    本报讯　西德经济部长艾哈德3日在慕尼黑说，认为西德应该出钱帮助美国解救美元危机，是一种“可笑的主张”。
    艾哈德是在对一批西德执政党基督教民主党人讲话时这样表示的。他认为，美国国际收支逆差的危机，主要是由于美国资本输出过多而引起的。但是，艾哈德又谈到了西德的“贡献”。他说，在不久以前举行的西德美国财政会谈中，西德曾经表示愿意提供总数至少达十二亿美元的各种款项，其中包括预先缴付的债款和分担北大西洋集团的军事费用。
