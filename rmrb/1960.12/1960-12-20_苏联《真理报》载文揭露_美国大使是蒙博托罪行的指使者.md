Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th. TASS reports: The Soviet newspaper *Pravda* published on the 16th an article by Pomnyashchy titled "Mr. Timberlake, Teacher of a Gang of Bandits," exposing the criminal activities of U.S. Ambassador to the Congo, Timberlake, in the Congo, particularly in the arrest of Prime Minister Lumumba.

The article states that shortly before the arrest and maltreatment of Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba, Timberlake telephoned the U.S. *New York Mirror* and said, "Mobutu has an interesting idea." The ambassador did not say at the time that this idea originally belonged to him. But now, no one considers it a secret.

Timberlake found Mobutu in the list of agents of the Belgian secret police, summoned him to the embassy, scrutinized him carefully, and expressed his own ideas. A few days later, Mobutu accepted this idea and immediately began to implement it.

The article says, we know how things got started. According to American newspaper reporters, when the gangsters were preparing to seize power, their leader ran to the American embassy two or three times a day. When the Mobutu gang unscrupulously attacked foreign diplomatic envoys in Leopoldville, many observers pointed out that the Mobutu elements did not attack any American diplomatic personnel. Moreover, Timberlake became an advisor to the Congolese traitorous gang and their open instigator.

However, this did not prevent Timberlake from swearing to Prime Minister Lumumba during their meetings that he had "friendly feelings" towards the government of the young republic. During meetings with Congolese parliamentarians, the American ambassador even promised to provide "selfless economic assistance." At the time, few Congolese suspected that the real purpose of these meetings was to probe which Congolese parliamentarians could be bought and become traitors.

The abominable nature of neo-colonialism lies precisely in: verbally recognizing the independence of young countries that have just freed themselves from foreign rule, while in fact implementing a policy of "tying their hands," buying, intimidating, and persecuting honest people.

The author also wrote about the ignominious activities of UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld in the Congo.

### 苏联《真理报》载文揭露  美国大使是蒙博托罪行的指使者

    苏联《真理报》载文揭露
    美国大使是蒙博托罪行的指使者
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联《真理报》16日发表了?波姆尼亚希写的一篇题为《廷伯累克先生，亡命匪帮的老师》的文章，揭露美国驻刚果大使廷伯累克在刚果，特别是在逮捕卢蒙巴总理的过程中所进行的罪恶活动。
    文章说，在逮捕和虐待刚果总理卢蒙巴之前不久，廷伯累克曾给美国《纽约镜报》打电话说，“蒙博托有一个有趣的想法”。这位大使当时没有说，这种想法本来是属于他本人的。但是，现在谁也不认为这是秘密了。
    廷伯累克从比利时秘密警察的特务名单中找到了蒙博托，把他召到大使馆，对他仔细端详了一番，谈出了自己的想法，过了几天蒙博托就接受了这种想法，并立即着手实现这种想法了。
    文章说，我们知道事情是怎么搞起来的。据美国报纸的记者们证明，在匪徒们准备夺取政权的时候，他们的头子曾一天两、三次地跑到美国大使馆。当蒙博托匪帮在利奥波德维尔肆无忌惮地攻击各国外交使节时，很多观察家都指出，蒙博托分子没有攻击任何一个美国外交人员。不仅如此，廷伯累克成了刚果卖国匪帮的顾问，成了他们的公开的鼓动者。
    但是，这并不妨碍廷伯累克在同卢蒙巴总理会晤时指天发誓地表示他对年轻的共和国政府的“友好感情”。在同刚果议员会晤时，这位美国大使还曾答应提供“无私的经济援助”。当时，刚果人中很少有人猜到，这种会晤的真正目的是，试探一下，有哪些刚果议员可以收买，成为卖国者。
    新殖民主义的可恶本质正是在于：在口头上承认刚刚摆脱外国统治的年轻国家的独立，而事实上却是实行“倒剪二臂”的政策，收买、恐吓和迫害诚实的人们。
    作者还写到了联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德在刚果的不光彩的活动。
