    Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd, Tokyo Dispatch: Okakura Koshishiro, Chairman of the Japan-Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee, issued a statement today welcoming the signing of the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression between China and Cambodia. He emphasized that the fact that China has successively signed similar treaties with Burma, Nepal, Afghanistan, and Cambodia this year proves that China consistently adopts a peaceful coexistence foreign policy between countries with different social systems.
    Okakura pointed out that experience has proven that only by relying on the establishment of friendly relations with socialist countries can the independence, security, and neutrality of newly independent countries be guaranteed. He said that this is the trend of history. Okakura also pointed out that Japan's independence, peace, and neutrality can only be guaranteed if Japan breaks away from the Japan-US military alliance and establishes friendly relations with all countries.
    He also said that the conclusion of the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression between China and Cambodia is of great significance to the Asian people's struggle against imperialist aggression, for national independence, and for the cause of Asian peace. He pointed out that especially at a time when US imperialism is interfering in Laos, China's establishment of peaceful coexistence and friendly relations with Cambodia, a neighbor of Laos, is a heavy blow to the US imperialists.
    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, December 23rd: The weekly "Cambodia Today" published an article today welcoming the signing of the Sino-Cambodian Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression, and emphasized that this is a big step towards peace.
    The commentary said that maintaining friendship with the socialist camp is not only a matter of prudence, but also an act of justice. "For many years, some people have been carrying out propaganda to try to make us believe that socialism is bad and capitalism is good, that we should avoid the 'devil', even if it is smiling at us; we should believe in the 'angel', even if it is cold to us." The commentary said that Cambodians no longer listen to this kind of talk.

    欢迎中柬签订友好条约
    日本冈仓古志郎说条约对亚洲和平具有重要意义
    新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本亚非团结委员会理事长冈仓古志郎今天发表谈话，表示欢迎中国和柬埔寨签订友好和互不侵犯条约。他强调说，今年中国相继同缅甸、尼泊尔、阿富汗和柬埔寨签订了类似的条约这些事实证明，中国一贯采取不同社会制度国家之间的和平共处外交政策。
    冈仓指出，经验证明，只有依靠同社会主义国家建立友好关系，新近取得独立的国家的独立、安全和中立才有保证。他说，这是历史潮流。冈仓并且指出，日本的独立、和平、中立只有使日本摆脱日美军事同盟，同所有国家建立友好关系才有保证。
    他还说，中国和柬埔寨缔结友好和互不侵犯条约对于亚洲各国人民反对帝国主义侵略、争取民族独立和亚洲和平事业具有重要意义。他指出，尤其是在目前美帝国主义干涉老挝的时候，中国同老挝邻国柬埔寨确立和平共处友好关系，对于美帝国主义者是一次沉重的打击。
    据新华社金边23日电“柬埔寨现状”周刊今天发表文章，欢迎中柬友好和互不侵犯条约的签订，并且强调这是向和平迈进了一大步。
    评论说，保持同社会主义阵营的友谊不仅是出于审慎，也是正义的行为。“好多年来，有些人所进行的宣传企图使我们相信：社会主义不好，资本主义好，我们应该回避‘魔鬼’，即使它在向我们微笑；我们应该相信‘天使’，即使它对我们冷淡。”评论说，柬埔寨人再也不听信这一套话了。
