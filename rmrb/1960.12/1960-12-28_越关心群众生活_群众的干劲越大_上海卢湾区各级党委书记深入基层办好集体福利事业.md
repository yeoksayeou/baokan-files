Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 27th: The Luwan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Party Committee Secretaries of each street have been going deep into neighborhood public canteens, life service stations, and nurseries, focusing on running the canteens well and grasping the masses' lives, making these collective welfare and social service undertakings better and better.

Luwan District has over two hundred neighborhood canteens, more than seventy life service stations, and over one hundred and thirty nurseries and kindergartens. The service objects of these units are many women participating in production and factory workers. In order to run these collective welfare undertakings well and support street and factory production, twenty-two secretaries of the eight street Party committees, fifty-six neighborhood branch secretaries, and the broad masses of neighborhood cadres, led by the secretary of the Luwan District Party Committee of the CCP, have gone deep into canteens, service stations, and nurseries. Through eating, working, and consulting with the masses, they help these units solve problems in a timely manner and improve the quality of their work. Lu Hongzhang, Deputy Secretary of the Dapulu Bridge Street Party Committee, while working in the relatively poor Zhaojiabang Road Neighborhood Committee First Canteen, found that the canteen staff lacked methods for doing a good job and the management system was not sound enough. He transferred dedicated personnel to strengthen the leadership of the canteen and held a symposium to study improvement methods with the canteen staff, helping them establish and improve various management systems, which quickly changed the canteen's face. Ma Yushan, Deputy Secretary of the Ruijin Road Street Party Committee, when working in the Renminfang Central Canteen, was told by the cooks that the stoves were old and broken, causing slow cooking and high coal consumption; the kitchen floor was uneven, the sewers leaked, and the ground was very damp. He immediately mobilized the neighborhood masses and organized relevant departments to help the canteen build new stoves, repair the underground sewers, and level the foundation, greatly boosting the enthusiasm of the canteen staff.

In addition to running the canteens well, Party organizations at all levels in Luwan District also regard running service stations and nurseries as an important part of improving the masses' lives. Zhu Chuanhui, Secretary of the Songshan Road Street Party Committee, found that the service stations lacked manpower, and a large number of cotton clothes and cotton shoes entrusted by the masses were backlogged. He immediately transferred more than one hundred people who could make clothes and more than twenty sewing machines from other production groups to strengthen the street and neighborhood service stations. At the same time, he organized master craftsmen from commercial departments to provide guidance to improve sewing and tailoring techniques, so that the service stations quickly met the needs of the masses.

After the District Committee grasped the masses' lives vigorously, the neighborhood public canteens, service stations, and nurseries throughout the district showed a new atmosphere. The neighborhood canteens further improved and established management systems, improved service attitudes, and generally achieved enthusiasm (referring to the service attitude of the staff), hot meals, hot dishes, and hot soup; some canteens delivered hot night meals to the workshops of night shift workers, and some canteens delivered breakfast to vegetable market salespersons early in the morning. Many service stations also proactively provided door-to-door service to factories and street production organizations.

    越关心群众生活　群众的干劲越大
    上海卢湾区各级党委书记深入基层办好集体福利事业
    新华社上海27日电　中共上海市卢湾区委和各街道党委书记深入里弄公共食堂、生活服务站和托儿所，以办好食堂为中心，大抓群众生活，使这些集体福利和社会服务事业越办越好。
    卢湾全区有二百多个里弄食堂，七十多个生活服务站，还有一百三十多个托儿所和幼儿园。这些单位的服务对象有许多是参加生产的家庭妇女和工厂职工。为了办好这些集体福利事业，支援街道和工厂生产，全区八个街道党委的二十二个书记、五十六个里弄支部书记以及广大里弄干部，在中共卢湾区党委书记带头下，都深入食堂、服务站和托儿所，通过和群众同吃、同劳动、同商量，帮助这些单位及时解决问题，提高工作质量。打浦桥街道党委副书记陆鸿章在比较差的肇嘉浜路里弄委员会第一食堂劳动中，发现这个食堂的工作人员缺少搞好工作的办法，经营管理制度也不够健全。他就抽调专人加强这个食堂的领导，并且召开座谈会和食堂工作人员一起研究改进办法，帮助他们建立和健全了各种经营管理制度，使食堂很快改变了面貌。瑞金路街道党委副书记马玉山在人民坊中心食堂劳动的时候，炊事员们向他反映炉灶因使用日久坏了，烧饭慢，用煤多；厨房里的地面高低不平，下水道漏水，地面上很潮湿。他马上发动里弄群众和组织有关部门协助食堂新砌炉灶，修理地下水道，平整地基，大大鼓舞了食堂工作人员的积极性。
    除了办好食堂外，卢湾区各级党组织还把办好服务站和托儿所作为搞好群众生活的一个重要环节。嵩山路街道党委书记朱传慧发现服务站力量不够，群众交做的棉衣、棉鞋积压不少，就马上从其他生产组中抽调出会做衣服的人员一百多人、缝纫机二十多部，加强街道和里弄服务站，同时组织商业部门老师傅来指导提高缝纫、裁剪技术，使服务站很快就满足了群众的需要。
    区委大抓群众生活以后，全区里弄公共食堂、服务站和托儿所都出现了新的气象。里弄食堂进一步健全和建立了经营管理制度，改善服务态度，普遍做到热心（指工作人员的服务态度）、热饭、热菜、热汤；有的食堂把热腾腾的夜餐送到夜班工人的车间里，有的食堂清早把早点送给菜场的营业员。许多服务站还主动到工厂和街道生产组织上门服务。
