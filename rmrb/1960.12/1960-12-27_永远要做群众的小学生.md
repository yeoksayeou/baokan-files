    Always Be a Pupil of the Masses
    Wang Weixuan Chen Ji Zeng Zheng

    Two years ago, there was a report in "Chinese Women" entitled "Chairman Mao Comes to Our Pig Farm," in which a passage lingered in people's minds.

      "When we got to the pig farm, we were afraid that Chairman Mao would be tired, and asked
  him to take a break, but he didn't rest.
  He saw the cow dung being cooked in the pot, walked over, scooped up a ladle
  and looked at it, asking: 'What is this? Is it cow dung?'
      'Yes, it's cow dung, it's saccharified cow dung.' Chun Lanzi
  rushed to answer: 'It's used to feed the pigs, and the pigs love it!'
      'That's really something new, cow dung can also be used to feed pigs!' Chairman Mao
  said with great interest. He personally scooped two ladles to feed the pigs, and seeing
  that the pigs were eating so enthusiastically, he was even more
  happy, and asked me: 'How is it made? Can you introduce it?'
      As I introduced it, he took out a notebook
  and said to Comrade Jingquan: Comrade Jingquan, come, we
  should all write this down, this is the creation of the masses! We have never
  heard of it before. It seems that the old Chinese saying: "Live and learn,"
  is really true!'"

    This is just a small anecdote among the many moving stories about Chairman Mao. However, as Lenin said, "The sun is reflected in a drop of water," Chairman Mao's spirit of cherishing the various creations of the broad masses and absorbing beneficial factors from them is vividly reflected here.

    Marxists believe that only by first being a good "student" of the masses can one be a good "teacher" of the masses. "Teacher" is the development of "student," but not the end of "student." If one is unwilling to appear as a "student" again, one cannot continue to be a "teacher." This relationship between "teacher" and "student," according to Chairman Mao's most scientific summary, is: from the masses, to the masses, concentrate it, and persevere.

    The basic point of the mass line is to believe that the people are the real creators of history, and that the people can only liberate themselves by relying on their own strength. The people are the ocean of human wisdom. The cause of people's liberation can only be accomplished by fully developing the wisdom and energy of the masses. It is precisely because of this that the essence of our Party's general line for building socialism is to maximize the enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of the people. Revolutionaries must be good at mobilizing this great, infinite force to serve the cause of socialist construction.

    If we want to concentrate the wisdom of the people and draw strength from it, we must have the spirit of "not being ashamed to ask." Chairman Mao said: "We must never pretend to know what we do not know, we must 'not be ashamed to ask,' and we must be good at listening to the opinions of the cadres below. First be a student, then be a teacher; first consult the cadres below, and then issue orders." ("Methods of Work of Party Committees") "Not being ashamed to ask" is the key to doing all work well, and it is also the concrete application of our Party's mass line working method. There are many examples in real life to prove this.

    Comrade Li Junqing, the leader of the Seventh Team of Zaoergou in Chengchuan Commune, Huicheng County, Gansu, led the entire team to turn a poor family into a rich family, and from a production-reducing team into an over-production team. The reason for this, in addition to resolutely listening to the Party, is to humbly learn from the masses and "not be ashamed to ask." No matter what task is assigned by the higher authorities, he takes it to discuss with the masses and ask for their advice. Mountain slopes, the soil quality of shady and sunny slopes are different; on the same slope, the upper and lower halves are different; on the same piece of land, the edges and the middle are sometimes different. These lands have been cultivated by the old farmers for most of their lives, and they know where they are willing to grow and where they are not. Comrade Li Junqing squats down to ask the masses for advice whenever he has time. With this "family heirloom," the plans he makes are often more correct and often successful in practice.

    When the Fifth Engineering Company of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation was building the No. 1 blast furnace charging car pit, the Party committee decided to use the caisson construction method. Comrade Han Xi, a member of the Party committee, considered that if the old method of digging soil from all around was used, the work surface would become smaller and smaller, people would have to sit idle, and the caisson could not sink more than thirty centimeters each time, then the task would take forty-five days to complete. Could the construction period be shortened? So, he went to discuss it with the workers. Two veteran workers suggested the method of taking soil from the middle, which overcame the shortcomings of the old method. There was no glass leveling instrument for sinking the caisson, so he went to ask the workers for advice. Two other veteran workers suggested the method of hanging a plumb bob, which maintained the balanced sinking of the caisson. In this way, the project that would have taken forty-five days was completed in twelve days.

    For every leading cadre, only by humbly learning from the people can one improve oneself, and then fulfill one's obligations to the people and victoriously guide the people's struggle. Today, more and more people understand this truth. In addition to the examples mentioned above, many people who are praised by the broad masses as "confidant secretaries" and "living keys" are all filled with the spirit of "not being ashamed to ask." However, it is not so easy to truly achieve "not being ashamed to ask." Some people shout about believing in the masses, but draw "frames" in their hearts. For example, in the implementation of the "three guarantees," the area must fall into this "frame," and the output must also fall into this "frame." Those that fit their own "frame" are kept, and those that do not are discarded. How can we talk about "not being ashamed to ask" if these "frames" are not broken? Even if we "ask," what kind of result will we "ask" for? There are also people who are "ashamed" to "ask." They are afraid of "losing face" if they "ask." All of these are nothing more than the result of bourgeois ideology at work. They always think that they are superior to the masses, look down on the masses, and do not trust the masses. However, according to true proletarian revolutionaries, "the masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often naive and ridiculous" (Chairman Mao: "Preface and Postscript to 'Rural Survey'"). They do not see the masses as being lower than themselves, but see themselves as being lower than the masses. Therefore, they are respectful, sincere, and humbly learn from the masses, first as students, then as teachers. Chairman Mao said: Any work, "without full enthusiasm, without the determination to look downwards, without the desire for knowledge, without putting down airs and being willing to be a pupil, cannot be done well." (Ibid.) Therefore, there is a class consciousness divide between "shame" and "not shame." Whether or not one is "not ashamed to ask" is not only a matter of working style, but also a matter of worldview. The reason why Li Junqing, Han Xi, and many other comrades can do their work well is because they have a strong mass viewpoint. This style, this attitude, is a fundamental point that distinguishes proletarian revolutionaries from bourgeois revolutionaries.

    The process of "not being ashamed to ask" is also a process of self-education. Will our advocacy of "not being ashamed to ask" affect the prestige of the "asker"? Not only will it not, but on the contrary. Only by humbly learning from the masses and "not being ashamed to ask" can the leadership's prestige be raised even higher. This is because the result of "not being ashamed to ask" is that we can correctly absorb the opinions of the broad masses, and the policies and guidelines formulated can truly reflect the vital interests and requirements of the broad masses, and therefore these correct policies and guidelines can be resolutely implemented. This can not only truly exert the power of the policy, but also greatly enhance the prestige of the leadership. Conversely, if one is afraid of affecting one's own prestige and is unwilling to "not be ashamed to ask," pretends to know what one does not know, and makes decisions easily, the result will truly affect one's own prestige.

      "Not being ashamed to ask" is also a manifestation of the scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts. The socialist construction we are carrying out is an extremely arduous task. No matter how capable a person is, he cannot know everything. Take agricultural production as an example, to achieve a great leap forward in agricultural production, we must understand the temperament of various crops, we must master the natural conditions of the different climates, soil qualities, and terrains of each region, and we must try our best to make each of our reforms and measures adapt to the objective laws; and to achieve this, we must honestly ask the masses for advice, and we must "not be ashamed to ask" at all times. Chairman Mao said: "We must learn what we do not understand." ("On the People's Democratic Dictatorship") He also said: "The proletariat has only one sharpest and most effective weapon, and that is a serious and combative scientific attitude. The Communist Party does not rely on frightening people to eat, but on the truth of Marxism-Leninism, on seeking truth from facts, and on science." ("Oppose Party Stereotypes") "Not being ashamed to ask" is precisely the embodiment of this "relying on the truth of Marxism-Leninism to eat," "relying on science to eat," and "relying on seeking truth from facts to eat." Those who are unwilling to listen to the opinions of the masses, those who are unwilling to be pupils and want to stand on the heads of the masses as teachers, can only run into walls everywhere in the work they lead and delay the work.

    Today, the spirit of "not being ashamed to ask" has been unprecedentedly developed. The "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" have been widely carried out in factories and enterprises, and the system of cadres and the masses eating, living, working, and discussing together has been firmly established in rural areas. Through "not being ashamed to ask," the relationship between superiors and subordinates, between leaders and those led, and between cadres and the masses has undergone a new change. Further promoting these fine styles can enable our Party to gather the opinions of the broad masses more timely and comprehensively, and enable our Party's policies to be communicated more timely and comprehensively to the end, so that our socialist and communist cause will be invincible!

    永远要做群众的小学生
    王威宣　陈济　曾铮
    两年前，《中国妇女》有篇《毛主席来到我们的养猪场》的报道，其中有一段话使人久久不忘。
      “到了养猪场里，我们怕毛主席累，请
  他老人家休息一会，可他老人家没有休息，
  一眼看见锅里煮的牛粪，走过去舀起一瓢来
  看了看问：‘这是什么？是不是牛粪？’
      ‘是的，是牛粪，是糖化牛粪。’春兰子
  抢着作了回答：‘拿来喂猪的，猪很爱吃！’
      ‘真是新鲜事儿，牛粪也能喂猪！’毛主
  席很感兴趣地说。亲自舀了两瓢去喂猪，见
  猪都抖起抖起地吃得怪上劲，他老人家更加
  高兴了，问我：‘怎么个制法，介绍一下好吗？’
      我一边介绍，他老人家一边摸出笔记本
  来，向井泉同志说：井泉同志，来，我们
  都记上吧，这是群众的创造！从前我们就没
  听见说过。看来我们中国那句老话：“做到
  老，学到老，实在不错！”
    这不过是有关毛主席的许多动人事迹中的一小桩。但是，正像列宁所说的“太阳在一滴水珠里反映出来”一样，毛主席珍视广大群众各方面的创造并从中吸取有益的因素的精神，在这里栩栩如生地反映出来了。
    马克思主义者认为，只有先做好群众的“学生”，才能做好群众的“先生”。“先生”是“学生”的发展，却不是“学生”的终结。如果不愿再以“学生”的姿态出现，便不能继续再当“先生”。这种“先生”与“学生”的关系，按照毛主席最科学的概括，那就是：从群众中来，到群众中去，集中起来，坚持下去。
    群众路线的基本点，就是相信人民群众是真正的历史的创造者，人民群众只有依靠自己的力量才能解放自己。人民群众是人类智慧的海洋。人民解放事业只有在充分发挥群众的智慧和干劲的条件下，才能完成。正是因为如此，我们党的建设社会主义总路线的实质就是最大限度地发挥人民群众的积极性、自觉性和创造性。革命者就是要善于把这种伟大的无穷无尽的力量动员起来，为社会主义建设事业服务。
    我们若要集中人民群众的智慧，从中吸取力量，便要有“不耻下问”的精神。毛主席说：“我们切不可强不知以为知，要‘不耻下问’，要善于倾听下面干部的意见。先做学生，然后再做先生；先向下面干部请教，然后再下命令。”（《党委会的工作方法》）“不耻下问”，这是做好一切工作的关键所在，也是我们党的群众路线的工作方法的具体运用。关于这一点，在实际生活中有许多事例可以证明。
    甘肃徽成县成川公社枣儿沟第七小队的队长李俊清同志，他领导全小队把穷家变成了富家，由减产队变成了超产队。究其原因，除了坚决听党的话之外，就是虚心向群众学习，“不耻下问”。不管上级布置什么任务下来，他都拿去同群众商量，向群众请教。山坡地，阴坡和阳坡土质不一样；同一片坡上，上半截和下半截不一样；同一块地，边上和中间有时也不一样。这些土地在老农的手里盘了大半辈子，哪里肯长，哪里不肯长，他们全知道。李俊清同志一有空就蹲下来向群众请教。有了这个“传家宝”，他订的计划常是比较正确的，在实践中常是能够成功的。
    武钢第五工程公司修建一号高炉料车坑时，党委决定采用沉箱的施工方法。党委委员韩喜同志考虑，如果按照老办法，从四周挖土，越挖工作面就越小，人就要窝工，而且沉箱每次不能超过三十公分，那末任务要四十五天才能完成。能不能缩短工期呢？于是，他就去找工人商量。有两个老工人提出从中间取土的办法，这就克服了老办法的缺点。下沉箱没有玻璃的测量水平仪，他又去向工人请教。又有两个老工人提出吊线锤的办法，这就保持了沉箱的平衡下沉。这样一来，十二天便完成了四十五天才能完成的工程。
    对于每个领导干部来说，只有虚心地向人民群众学习，才能提高自己，然后才能履行自己对人民群众的义务，胜利地指导人民群众的斗争。今天，懂得这个道理的人是越来越多了。除了上面举的例子以外，许多被广大群众誉之为“知心书记”和“活钥匙”的人，都是充满着“不耻下问”的精神的人。但是，要真正地做到“不耻下问”，也还不是那末容易的。有的人口里喊相信群众，心里却画“框框”。比方说，在“三包”落实中，面积要落到这个“框框”里，产量也要落到这个“框框”里，合乎自己的“框框”则留，不合则去。这样的“框框”不打破，怎么谈得上“不耻下问”？即使“下问”了，又会“问”出个什么结果？还有的人是“耻”于“下问”的。他们生怕“下问”了，“丢人”，“失面子”。所有这些，无非是资产阶级思想在作祟的缘故。他们总认为自己比群众高出一头，瞧不起群众，不信任群众。但是，按照真正的无产阶级革命者看来，“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己往往是幼稚可笑的”（毛主席：《《农村调查》的序言和跋》）。他们不是把群众看得低自己一头，而是把自己看得比群众低一头。因此，他们恭恭敬敬，诚诚恳恳，拜群众为师，先当学生，后当先生。毛主席说：任何工作，“没有满腔的热忱，没有眼睛向下的决心，没有求知的渴望，没有放下臭架子、甘当小学生的精神，是一定不能做，也一定做不好的。”（同上）因此，在“耻”同“不耻”之间，是有一道阶级意识的鸿沟的。是不是“不耻下问”，不仅是一个工作作风的问题，而且是一个世界观的问题。李俊清、韩喜和其他许多同志之所以能做好工作，就在于他们有着强烈的群众观点。这种作风，这种态度，正是无产阶级革命家区别于资产阶级革命家的一个根本点。
    “不耻下问”的过程，也是一个自我教育的过程。我们提倡“不耻下问”，会不会影响“下问”者的威信呢？不仅不会，而且恰恰相反。只有虚心地向群众学习，“不耻下问”，领导威信才会提得更高。这是因为“不耻下问”的结果，便能正确地吸收广大群众意见，制订出的方针政策便能真正地反映广大群众的切身利益和要求，因而这些正确的方针政策便能够坚决地贯彻下去。这就不仅可以真正地发挥政策的威力，而且可以大大地提高领导的威信。相反的，如果怕影响自己的威信，因而不愿“不耻下问”，强不知以为知，轻易决定，其结果才真正要影响自己的威信。
      “不耻下问”也是实事求是的科学精神的表现。我们进行的社会主义建设，是一个极其艰巨的事业。一个人任凭有多大本领，也是不能无所不晓的。就拿农业生产来说吧，要取得农业生产上的大跃进，就要摸透各种作物的脾气，就要掌握每一个地区千差万别的气候、土质、地形的自然条件，就要极力使我们的每一项改革、每一项措施适应客观的规律；而要达到这一点，就非得老老实实地请教群众不可，就非得时时刻刻“不耻下问”不可。毛主席说：“我们必须学会自己不懂的东西。”（《论人民民主专政》）他又说：“无产阶级的最尖锐最有效的武器只有一个，那就是严肃的战斗的科学态度。共产党不靠吓人吃饭，而是靠马克思列宁主义的真理吃饭，靠实事求是吃饭，靠科学吃饭。”（《反对党八股》）“不耻下问”正是这种“靠马克思列宁主义真理吃饭”、“靠科学吃饭”、“靠实事求是吃饭”的体现。那些不愿意倾听群众意见的人，那些不愿意当小学生就要站在群众头上当先生的人，他们只能在自己所领导的工作中四处碰壁，贻误工作。
    今天，“不耻下问”的精神已经得到了空前巨大的发扬。在工厂企业中已经广泛地开展了“两参一改三结合”，在农村中已经巩固地建立了广大干部与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量的制度。通过“不耻下问”，上下级之间、领导者同被领导者之间、干部同群众之间的关系，已经有了一个新的变化。进一步发扬这些优良的作风，能使我们党更及时更全面地集中广大群众的意见，使我们党的政策更及时更全面地一通到底，从而使我们的社会主义和共产主义事业无往而不胜！
