Xinhua News Agency, December 9th, Washington dispatch: Many economists from the US government and private institutions unanimously acknowledge that the US economy has fallen into another cyclical crisis since the war.

According to the Associated Press, the economic committees of both houses of the US Congress held a panel discussion on the US economic problems on the 7th. The economists from government and private institutions who attended the discussion all believed that the United States is in a new "recession" (this is the American bourgeoisie's euphemism for economic crisis), and this "recession" is continuing to develop.

Senator Douglas, chairman of the economic committees of the two houses of Congress, who presided over the discussion, pointed out that the number of people applying for unemployment relief in the United States has been increasing, which shows that the number of unemployed people in the United States, which reached 6.4% of the total labor force in October, continues to rise. He estimated that by January next year, the number of unemployed people in the United States will be as high as 5.5 million. Douglas's opinion was supported by Wolfbein, Assistant Secretary for Labor.

Paradiso, head of statistics at the Bureau of Enterprise Economics of the Department of Commerce, said worriedly, "At present, there is no significant force that can provide the upward impetus necessary to restore economic development." However, "unfavorable factors" include "reduced consumer goods purchases," "a sharp reduction in housing construction," "reduced corporate spending on new plants and equipment," and "a large international payment deficit," among others.

Pechman, a representative of the Brookings Institution, called the current US economic crisis the "1960-1961 recession." He said that changes in some important indicators such as the decline in department store sales were "by no means reassuring." He also said, "Perhaps the most disturbing thing about this recession is that it began when the economy had not fully recovered from the previous recession."

Schultz, an associate professor in the economics department at Indiana University, admitted that the current "recession" in the US economy is continuing, and that this "recession" is the fourth since the end of World War II. Schultz also talked about the dilemma currently faced by the US government: a deepening economic crisis and a deteriorating financial situation.

Xinhua News Agency, December 9th, Washington dispatch: US Secretary of Commerce Mueller vigorously advocated that the United States expand exports on the 7th in order to shift the US economic crisis and international payment crisis to other countries.

Speaking at a meeting of the "National Export Expansion Committee" established by the US government specifically to stimulate exports, Mueller emphasized that the United States should intensify its export expansion in the future in order to further seize foreign markets and strengthen foreign economic expansion. He said: "Our obligations to our overseas friends (referring to the United States' control and infiltration of other countries) are extremely important to our foreign policy and our national security. In addition, we need to increase private investment and participate in the development work of underdeveloped countries." He said, "In order to pay for our many international programs, our export trade must increase by at least three billion dollars as soon as possible, and continue to increase on a long-term basis." He also said that only if US exports increase by three billion dollars each year can the foreign payment deficit be "maintained at a manageable level."

Mueller pointed out that the US government has recently taken a series of measures to try to expand exports and further penetrate the markets of other countries. He said that in recent years, the United States has sent 84 trade delegations to 49 countries in order to make "more overseas businessmen want to buy American goods." The first international trade center hosted by the United States for a full year will open in London in 1961. The offices established by the Department of Commerce in 33 cities are providing American manufacturers with information about opportunities to sell their products overseas. At the same time, foreign affairs staff and commercial groups in their regions are also working closely together to promote US export trade. Mueller encouraged large American companies to seize the opportunity to work hard to expand exports, and he especially asked those "manufacturers who only sell goods in the United States to sell to foreign markets."

Mueller also advocated that American companies should strengthen their competitiveness in the domestic market and strive to exclude goods from other countries.

    美国政府和私人机构的很多经济学家一致承认
    美国经济危机正在不断加深
    商业部长鼓吹大力增加出口加紧对外扩张转嫁危机恶果
    据新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府和私人机构的许多经济学家一致承认，美国经济已陷入战后又一次周期性的危机当中。
    据美联社报道，美国国会两院的经济委员会7日就美国的经济问题举行了一次小组讨论会，出席讨论会的政府和私人机构的经济学家全都认为，美国正处于一次新的“衰退”（这是美国资产阶级关于经济危机的代名词）当中，而且这次“衰退”还在继续发展。
    主持讨论会的参众两院经济委员会主席、参议员道格拉斯指出，目前美国申请失业救济的人一直在增加，这说明美国失业人数在10月份达到的占全部劳动力的比例6.4％的数字继续在上升。他估计，到明年1月，美国的失业人数将高达五百五十万人。道格拉斯这个意见得到劳工部助理部长帮办沃尔夫宾的赞同。
    商务部企业经济局主管统计的帕拉迪索忧心忡忡地说，“目前还看不到有什么重要的力量可以提供恢复经济发展所必需的向上的推动力”。可是“不利因素”却有“消费品购买减少”、“房屋建筑剧烈减少”、“企业用于新工厂和设备的开支减少”以及“国际支付逆差很大”等等。
    布鲁金斯学院的代表皮契曼把美国当前的经济危机称为“1960—1961年的衰退”。他说像百货公司销售额下降这样一些重要指标的变化“决不是令人安心的”。他还说，“这次衰退最令人感到不安的也许在于：它是在经济还没有完全从前一次衰退恢复过来的时候开始的。”
    印第安那大学经济系副教授舒尔茨承认，美国经济当前的“衰退”正在继续中，这次“衰退”已经是第二次世界大战结束以来的第四次。舒尔茨还谈到了美国政府目前面临的经济危机加深和财政情况恶化的两难局面。
    据新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：美国商务部长米勒7日大力鼓吹美国扩大出口，以便向其他国家转嫁美国的经济危机和国际支付危机。
    米勒在美国政府专门为刺激出口而设立的“全国扩大出口委员会”的一个会议上讲话时强调，美国今后要加紧扩大出口，以进一步夺取国外市场，加强对外经济扩张。他说：“我们对我们海外朋友的义务（指美国对其他国家的控制和渗入）对我们的外交政策和我们国家的安全是极其重要的。此外，我们还需要增加私人投资，参加不发达国家的发展工作。”他说，“为了支付我们许多的国际计划的款项，我们的出口贸易必需尽快至少一年增加三十亿美元，并且在长期的基础上继续增加。”他还说，只有美国的出口每年增加三十亿美元，才可以使对外支付差额“保持在可以驾驭的水平上”。
    米勒指出，美国政府近来已经采取了一系列的措施来设法扩大输出，进一步打入其他国家的市场。他说，最近几年来美国已经有八十四个贸易代表团对四十九个国家进行了访问，以便使得“更多的海外商人希望购买美国货”。美国主办的第一个整年活动的国际贸易中心将在1961年在伦敦开幕。商务部在三十三个城市设立的办事处正在为美国的制造商们提供关于在海外销售他们的产品的机会的情报。同时，外事工作人员和他们所在地区的商业团体，也正在进行着密切合作以促进美国的出口贸易。米勒鼓吹美国的大企业要抓紧机会努力扩大输出，他并且特别要求那些“仅仅是在美国销售商品的制造商们到外国市场去销售。”
    米勒同时鼓吹美国企业在国内市场要加强竞争能力，努力排斥其他国家的商品。
