This Dispatch from Chongqing, December 11th: The Liu Jia Yan Production Team Mess Hall of Chengjiang People's Commune in the suburbs of Chongqing, Sichuan, has formulated and adhered to a mess hall covenant, concretizing and systematizing the Party's policy of running mess halls well, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of all parties, and making the mess hall better and better.

In order to run the mess hall well, last winter, the Party branch of the Wuyi Production Brigade of Chengjiang People's Commune rectified the mess hall of the Liu Jia Yan Production Team. From the work of rectifying the mess hall, they realized that the key to running a mess hall well lies in earnestly implementing the Party's policy on mess halls and fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of every member. How can the enthusiasm of everyone be mobilized so that the Party's policy on mess halls takes root in everyone? They researched the form of formulating a mess hall covenant. The production team adopted a combination of team cadres, mess hall staff, and commune members, and wrote the requirements for all parties into the covenant. For example, the main requirements for production team cadres are: to eat in the mess hall and spend some time personally in the kitchen to jointly manage the mess hall with the mess hall staff and do a good job in mess hall sideline production; strengthen the leadership of the mess hall work, adhere to the system of electing mess hall staff once every six months, and hold a mess hall management committee once a month, etc.; adhere to the principles and policies of planned grain use, running the mess hall diligently and frugally, and running the mess hall democratically. The main requirements for mess hall staff are: to establish the idea of a red housekeeper, carefully arrange the lives of the commune members, and arrange the grain according to month, ten-day period, and per person; do a good job in mess hall sideline production, save on management expenses; keep financial accounts clear on a daily and monthly basis, and announce them to the commune members every month; eat the same food as the commune members, etc. Each commune member also made a covenant to actively participate in mess hall management, supervise the implementation of policies in the mess hall, actively participate in public welfare activities to improve the mess hall, and cherish mess hall public property.

In order to make the mess hall covenant more in line with the specific requirements for running the mess hall well at various times, and to make the covenant truly a program of action for everyone to run the mess hall well, in addition to the mess hall staff adhering to a weekly inspection of the implementation of the covenant, the Liu Jia Yan Production Team also took a combined approach every quarter to conduct an inspection, revision, and short-term arrangement for the mess hall covenant. This not only rectified the mess hall work but also facilitated the mobilization of the masses to supervise the implementation of policies. For example, at the beginning of September, based on the requirements for doing a good job in winter life, they made specific revisions to the mess hall covenant on winter ration arrangements, mess hall production, and the people's living requirements such as hot water and hot water supply, and timely mobilized the enthusiasm of all parties to prepare for winter life. For example, during the revision of the covenant, according to the requirements of the masses, it was determined that in addition to the mess hall actively engaging in sideline production, the commune members should also be mobilized to plant a season of short-term vegetables in the gaps between the field ridges and some small spring crops. The team's thirty-two households immediately took active action according to the regulations, and this item alone could yield more than 100,000 catties of vegetables.

Practice over the past year has proved that the Liu Jia Yan Production Team's formulation and continuous revision and adherence to the implementation of the mess hall covenant has provided a successful experience for running the mess hall well. First of all, after the mess hall covenant clearly stipulated the responsibilities of the cadres for running the mess hall well, it strengthened the specific leadership of the production team cadres over the mess hall, achieved the goal of cadres going down to the kitchen and politics entering the mess hall, and enabled the production team leaders to promptly discover and deal with the mess hall staff's thinking and various problems in the implementation of the mess hall policy. For example, after delving into the mess hall, the production team leader discovered that the mess hall staff was afraid of trouble and was not firmly implementing the ration policy of "quantifying according to people, eating with vouchers, and saving for oneself," which made some people worry about whether saving grain would be returned to them. The production team leader immediately dealt with this issue. The concerns of the commune members were dispelled, and the atmosphere of thrift became prevalent.

The mess hall staff has specific goals and responsibilities, etc., determined in the covenant, so they try their best to implement various policies and act according to the requirements of the masses. For example, in order to make the commune members save grain, eat enough, and eat well, they actively grow vegetables, raise livestock and poultry, and also collect sweet potato noses to grind starch, etc., which the commune members are very satisfied with.

With the mess hall covenant, the commune members can also better supervise the mess hall work, and at the same time, each person can also play an active role in running the mess hall well. Since the beginning of this year, the masses have put forward more than 250 suggestions to the mess hall, which has effectively improved the mess hall work. Because the mess hall staff and the masses actively do a good job in the mess hall sideline production and save mess hall expenses, all the cash expenses such as oil, salt, firewood, and vegetables for more than 200 people to eat are solved by the mess hall itself. The good operation of this mess hall has greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the commune members. All sixty-nine laborers in the team have maintained full attendance without illness this year, and all production tasks have been completed ahead of schedule. This year's grain output has increased compared to last year, and the sowing area of small spring crops has increased compared to last year. This production team has been praised and rewarded several times by Sichuan Province and Chongqing City.

### 刘家岩生产小队制订食堂公约加强民主管理  公约不断充实　伙食越办越好

    刘家岩生产小队制订食堂公约加强民主管理
    公约不断充实　伙食越办越好
    本报重庆11日电　四川重庆市郊澄江人民公社刘家岩生产小队食堂，通过制订和坚持执行食堂公约，把党的办好食堂的政策具体化、制度化，充分调动了各方面的积极性，食堂越办越好。
    为了把食堂办好，去年冬天，澄江人民公社五一生产大队党支部对刘家岩生产小队的食堂进行了整顿。从整顿食堂工作中，他们体会到：要把食堂办好，关键在于认真贯彻党对食堂的政策，充分调动每个群众的积极性。如何把每个人的积极性都调动起来，使党对食堂的政策在每个人身上生根落脚呢？他们研究出制订食堂公约这种形式。生产小队采取小队干部、食堂工作人员和社员群众三结合的办法，把对各方面人员的要求都订在公约上。例如，对生产小队干部的主要要求是：参加食堂吃饭，并以一部分时间亲自下厨房与食堂工作人员共同管理食堂和搞好食堂家底生产；加强对食堂工作的领导，坚持半年选举一次食堂工作人员的制度，每月召开一次食堂管理委员会等；坚持执行计划用粮、勤俭办食堂、民主办食堂等方针政策。对食堂工作人员的要求主要是：树立红管家思想，认真安排好社员生活，粮食要按月、按旬、按人安排；搞好食堂家底生产，节约管理费用；财务账目日清月结，每月向社员公布；与社员吃一样饭菜等。每个社员群众也订了主动参加食堂管理，监督食堂贯彻执行政策，积极参加改善食堂的公益活动，以及爱护食堂公物等公约。
    为了使食堂公约更加切合各个时期对办好食堂的具体要求，使公约真正成为每个人办好食堂的行动纲领，刘家岩生产小队除了食堂工作人员坚持了每周检查一次执行公约的情况以外，一个季度还采取三结合的办法对食堂公约进行一次检查、修订和订立执行公约的短安排。这样既整顿了食堂工作，又便于发动群众监督执行政策。例如，9月初，他们根据搞好冬季生活的要求，对冬季的口粮安排、食堂生产以及群众对开水、热水供应等生活要求都在食堂公约中作了具体修订，及时调动了各方面的积极性，作好了冬季生活准备。又如，修订公约中，根据群众的要求，确定除了食堂积极搞好家底生产，并发动社员在田坎和一些小春作物间隙种一季短期蔬菜。全队三十二户社员立即根据规定积极行动起来，仅这一项就可以多收蔬菜十万斤左右。
    一年来的实践证明，刘家岩生产小队制定和不断修订、坚持贯彻食堂公约，为办好食堂提供了成功经验。首先，食堂公约明确规定了干部对办好食堂的职责以后，加强了生产小队干部对食堂的具体领导，做到了干部下厨房、政治进食堂，使生产小队的领导及时发现和处理了食堂工作人员的思想以及贯彻执行食堂政策中的各项问题。例如，生产队长在深入食堂以后，发现了食堂工作人员怕麻烦，对“以人定量、凭证吃饭、节约归己”的口粮政策执行不坚决，使一些群众对节约粮食是不是归己产生顾虑。生产队长立即处理了这个问题。社员顾虑解除了，节约之风大兴。
    食堂工作人员有了公约上确定的具体的努力目标和职责范围等，所以他们就千方百计执行各项政策和按照群众要求办事。例如，他们为了使社员用粮省、吃得饱、吃得好，积极种好蔬菜、喂好家畜家禽，还收集了红薯鼻子磨淀粉等，社员很满意。
    有了食堂公约，社员群众也能更好地监督食堂工作，同时每个群众也发挥了办好食堂的主动性。今年以来，群众就给食堂提出了二百五十多项建议，有效地改进了食堂工作。由于食堂工作人员和群众积极搞好食堂家底生产和节约食堂开支，二百多人吃饭的油、盐、柴、菜等一切现金费用，食堂都自己解决了。这个食堂办得好，大大鼓舞了社员的生产积极性。全队六十九个劳动力，今年一直保持了无病全勤，生产任务项项提前完成。今年粮食产量较去年增加，小春播种面积比去年增加。这个生产队先后受到了四川省和重庆市的几次表扬和奖励。
