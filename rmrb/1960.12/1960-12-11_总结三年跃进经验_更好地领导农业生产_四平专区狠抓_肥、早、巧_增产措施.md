This article reports that the Siping Prefecture of Jilin Province, based on the comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," focused on fertilizer, earliness, and skill as key measures to increase production according to local conditions. The "Three Great Revolutions" were carried out in fertilizer work, effectively promoting agricultural production increase.

(Dispatch from this newspaper) Siping Prefecture has fertile land, abundant fertilizer sources, and other favorable conditions, suitable for developing agricultural production. However, the whole region has a large land area and a small population, and the frost-free period is only about 135 days. At the same time, most of the annual rainfall is concentrated in July and August. In the past, cultivation was relatively extensive, with frequent waterlogging and frost damage. In order to promote favorable conditions and overcome unfavorable factors to further increase grain production, the CPC Siping Prefectural Committee seriously summarized the experience of agricultural production since the Great Leap Forward, analyzed the characteristics of agricultural production in the region, and found a better way to implement the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" in accordance with local conditions, that is, to focus on "fertilizer, early, and skill" three measures to increase production.

Placing fertilizer work in the primary position of all measures to increase production is the correct conclusion drawn by the CPC Siping Prefectural Committee after analyzing the farming habits of the farmers in the region, the natural characteristics, and the current new situation. Due to the large land area and a small population, there has always been a habit of applying fertilizer once every three years. Although fertilizer work has made great progress in recent years, it still cannot meet the needs, which will affect the comprehensive implementation of the policy of multiple varieties and multiple harvests, as well as high yields and multiple harvests. More than 20% of the low-yielding fields in the entire region require rapid application of fertilizer. Places where summer floods and autumn frosts occur almost every year also need more fertilizer to ensure that crops grow quickly and mature early, overcoming natural disasters. Since the Great Leap Forward, reasonable close planting has been widely promoted, and the area of multiple high-yielding crops and replanting has continued to expand, all of which urgently require fertilizer work to keep up. And there are large amounts of peat everywhere here, natural fertilizer sources are extremely abundant, and the potential of farm fertilizer sources is very large. On the basis of continuously carrying out mass fertilizer accumulation and fertilizer production movements in the whole region in recent years, making fertilizer accumulation work a further step forward, the whole region has universally carried out the "Three Great Revolutions" of fertilizer accumulation and fertilizer production, that is, vigorously carrying out field fertilizer accumulation, over-the-circle fertilizer, and winter warm manure heaps.

In the "Three Great Revolutions," Dongfeng, Liaoyuan, Yitong and other cities and counties in the eastern mountainous area of the prefecture put forward the slogan of "wild manure does not enter the house, and household manure is sent up the mountain," setting off a craze for building circles on mountain slopes and digging manure pits in the fields. Shuangliao County in the west and Huaide, Lishu, Siping and other cities and counties in the central area also carried out a movement to build mobile livestock circles and accumulate over-the-circle manure. As of the beginning of November, the whole region had established 7,800 field livestock circles, more than 21,000 field fertilizer pits, and more than 15,000 manure heaps. A total of about 5 million man-days and about 6 million animal-days of fertilizer transportation labor can be saved this winter, accounting for about 20% of the annual production labor. In this way, some arable land that was not fertilized in the past can also be fertilized. Since the beginning of winter, various places have actively dug and pounded manure, and piled it into insulated manure heaps to further ferment and mature the fertilizer, and also create conditions for saving the labor of digging frozen manure and sending fertilizer early. Various places have also further promoted the combination of pig raising and fertilizer accumulation, year-round fertilizer accumulation and surprise fertilizer accumulation, and the combination of collective fertilizer accumulation and individual fertilizer accumulation.

While grasping fertilizer, according to the characteristics that the frost-free period in this area is shorter than the growth period of crops, and also in order to make the continuously increased fertilizer truly play a role in increasing production, Siping Prefecture also grasped the word "early." Make every effort to make appropriate early planting and early arrangement and early start of various production, so as to further give play to people's subjective initiative and promote grain production increase. Since 1958, the whole region has universally promoted timely early planting, which is 7 to 10 days earlier than in the past. The harm of early frost has been basically overcome. Last year and this year, timely early planting was done even better. Due to early planting, it also achieved early weeding and multiple weeding, early top dressing and multiple top dressing. Therefore, the phenomena of less sunshine, low temperature and weedy wasteland in the rainy season were basically overcome, ensuring the rapid growth and early maturity of crops. In addition, frost damage was further prevented, and the harvest was guaranteed. The broad masses of cadres and the masses have experienced the benefits of "early" from early planting, so they consciously act in the spirit of looking at the next step after taking a step, and "planting a year's crops for two years." They grasp everything early according to the specific situation, and do the work that needs to be advanced and can be advanced. For example, after the autumn harvest this year, they actively prepared for next year's production. In this way, the phenomenon of excessively concentrated farm work is effectively overcome, the tension of the busy farming season is eased, and it is beneficial to overcome the bad habit of extensive cultivation and strive to be perfection. For example, this year's summer weeding and autumn harvest were done more timely and meticulously than in any previous year.

The shortage of labor and animal power is the main difficulty in realizing the two measures of fertilizer accumulation and grasping early, and other measures to increase production. The main way to overcome this difficulty is to vigorously engage in "skillful" work. The CPC Siping Prefectural Committee strengthened the leadership of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and put forward the slogan of asking new tools for labor. In accordance with the policy of combining local and foreign methods and walking on two legs, various localities launched a mass movement to reform agricultural tools and tools, aiming at projects that consume a lot of labor and have high labor intensity. In the past three years, the whole region has reformed more than 331,000 various tools, of which the agricultural tools reformed this year exceeded the sum of the previous two years. While vigorously reforming field tools, reforms were also implemented in grain and rice processing, feed crushing, pig raising, and cafeteria utensils that consume a lot of labor. At present, more than 1,300 canteens in the region, as well as more than 220 management districts and 510 production teams, have achieved semi-mechanization of grain and rice processing and feed crushing. Due to the reform of the above-mentioned agricultural tools and tools, the whole region has saved a total of 8.7 million labor days in the past three years.

    总结三年跃进经验　更好地领导农业生产
    四平专区狠抓“肥、早、巧”增产措施
    本报讯　吉林省四平专区在全面贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”的基础上，因地制宜地重点抓住肥料、早、巧等三项措施，并在肥料工作中开展“三大革命”，有效地推动了农业的增产。
    四平专区土地肥沃，有丰富的肥源等有利条件，适合发展农业生产。但是，全区地多人少，无霜期只有一百三十五天左右，同时，全年雨水多集中在7、8月份。过去耕作比较粗放，内涝、霜冻较多。为了发扬有利条件，克服不利因素，进一步增产粮食，中共四平地委认真总结了大跃进以来农业生产的经验，分析了本区农业生产的特点，找出更好地因地制宜的贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”的办法，即着重抓住“肥、早、巧”三项增产措施。
    把肥料工作摆在各项增产措施的首要地位，是中共四平地委分析了全区农民的耕作习惯、自然特点和当前的新形势，得出的正确结论。由于地多人少，这里一向有三年施一次肥的习惯，虽然近几年来肥料工作有很大发展，但至今仍然不能满足需要，这就将影响到多种多收和高产多收同时并举方针的全面贯彻。全专区占20％以上的低产田，要求迅速增施肥料。几乎年年发生的夏涝、秋霜等灾害的地方，也需要多施肥，以保证作物快长、早熟，克服自然灾害。大跃进以来普遍推广了合理密植，多种高产和复种面积也不断扩大等，所有这些都迫切要求肥料工作跟上去。而这里到处蕴藏着大量草炭，自然肥源极为丰富，农家肥源的潜力很大。在全区几年来不断开展群众性积肥造肥运动的基础上，使积肥工作再前进一步，全区普遍开展了积肥造肥的“三大革命”，即大搞田间积肥、过圈肥和冬季暖粪堆。
    在“三大革命”中，专区东部半山区的东丰、辽源、伊通等市县，提出了“野粪不进家、家粪送上山”的口号，掀起了山坡建圈、田间挖粪坑的热潮。西部双辽县和中部怀德、梨树、四平等市县，也都开展了建流动畜圈、积攒过圈粪的运动。到11月上旬止，全区共建立田间畜圈七千八百处，田间沤肥坑两万一千多个，积造粪堆一万五千多个。一共可使今冬节省运肥人工约五百万个，畜工约六百万个，共占一年生产用工的20％左右。这样可使一些过去不施肥的耕地也施上肥。入冬以来，各地都积极挖粪和捣粪，并堆成保温的大粪堆，使肥料进一步发酵腐熟，也为节省刨冻粪用工和提早送肥创造了条件。各地还进一步推行了养猪积肥、常年积肥和突击积肥相结合，集体积肥和个人积肥相结合等经验。
    在抓肥料的同时，根据本区无霜期短于农作物生长期的特点，也为了使不断增施的肥料真正起到增产作用，四平专区还抓了“早”字。尽力作到适当的早种和各项生产的早安排，早动手，从而进一步发挥了人的主观能动性，促进了粮食增产。从1958年起全区普遍推行了适时早种，比过去提前七至十天。基本上克服了早霜的危害。去年和今年适时早种搞得更好。由于早种，也做到了提早铲趟和多铲多趟，提早追肥和多追肥等。因而基本战胜了日照少、气温低和雨季草荒现象，保证了作物快长早熟。此，进一步防止了霜害，保证了收成。广大干部和群众从早种中体验到“早”的好处，于是都自觉地本着走上步看下步，“一年庄稼二年种”的精神，根据具体情况时时事事抓早，把需要提前和可能提前做的活计都提前做。如今年秋收结束后，就积极为明年生产作了准备。这样，就有效地克服了农活过于集中的现象，缓和了农忙季节的紧张程度，并有利于克服耕作粗放的不良习惯，尽量作到精益求精。例如今年的夏锄和秋收，都比过去任何一年做得及时细致。
    劳力、畜力不足，是实现积肥和抓早两项措施和其他增产措施的主要困难。克服这一困难的主要办法是大搞“巧”干。中共四平地委加强了对技术革新和技术革命运动的领导，提出了向新工具要劳动力的口号。各地本着土洋结合、两条腿走路的方针，针对费劳动力多和劳动强度高的项目，展开了群众性的农具和工具改革运动。三年来，全区共改革各种工具三十三万一千多件，其中今年改革的农具超过前两年的总和。在大力改革田间工具的同时，也实行了费工多的粮米加工，饲料粉碎，养猪和食堂用具的改革。目前全区已有一千三百多个食堂，以及二百二十多个管理区、五百一十个生产队的粮米加工和饲料粉碎实现了半机械化。由于以上各项农具和工具的改革，三年来全区共节省劳动日达八百七十万个。
