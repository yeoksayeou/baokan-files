Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, December 29th: The Yingcheng Coal Mine Party Committee in Jilin Province has correctly handled the relationships between production and construction, production and preparation, production and transportation, and production and living in coal mine production. By November 20th this year, it had overfulfilled the planned targets for output, quality, tunneling, and sales.

　　While focusing on production and actively transforming the original mines to expand production as much as possible, the Yingcheng Mine Party Committee boldly mobilized the masses to conduct geological exploration. Adopting the principle of exploring, designing, and constructing simultaneously, it started the construction of five new pairs of mine shafts in just over two years. Once these mine shafts are all put into production, the mine's production capacity will be doubled compared to the existing level.

　　As a result of grasping production and construction simultaneously, the average annual increase in the mine's output since 1958 has been 32.4%. This year, it increased by another 36.5% compared to last year.

　　Using coal mining to promote tunneling and tunneling to guarantee coal mining is another relationship that the leaders of the Yingcheng Coal Mine constantly adjust in their work. Regularly maintaining two to three tunneling faces for each mining face is an important measure taken by the mine to correctly handle the relationship between mining and tunneling. However, not all leading cadres were clear about how to correctly handle the relationship between mining and tunneling at the beginning. Some people worried: "If coal mining is too fast, tunneling will not keep up. What should we do if we deplete our resources?" They advocated waiting for tunneling before mining. The Yingcheng Coal Mine Party Committee continuously criticized this passive balancing idea and adhered to the active policy of "using mining to drive tunneling and tunneling to guarantee mining" and of giving equal importance to both. As a result, the number of tunneling teams in the entire mine increased from 53 last year to more than 100 this year, and the total tunneling footage in the mine increased by 29.4% compared to last year. The recoverable reserves of the preparation workface have been maintained at around six months, meeting the needs of continuous leap-forward production.

　　In order to gain time to produce more coal for the country, this coal mine has also explored an experience to resolve the contradiction between production and equipment maintenance.

　　In the past, maintenance was carried out during festivals or at the scheduled time each month. Production had to be stopped during maintenance, which resulted in a reduction of more than 100,000 tons of coal per year. Moreover, because all units rushed to carry out maintenance during the New Year, there were many projects and the scope was wide, making it impossible to concentrate manpower and resources, which inevitably resulted in long maintenance times and low quality. Since May of this year, the mine Party Committee has carefully analyzed this contradiction. In order to ensure that maintenance and production do not interfere with each other, it always meticulously arranged the maintenance plan and made all preparations before maintenance during each maintenance period. On the one hand, the workers were mobilized to concentrate their efforts on producing coal the day before the maintenance, postponing the production preparation work for that day to the maintenance period, so that there was sufficient time to focus on output before the maintenance. On the day of maintenance, the production workers used the maintenance gap to prepare for high output, and then organized high output after the maintenance. During the maintenance period, they used the maintenance as a driving force and launched a mass movement of "You maintain, I support; I move, you achieve high output; vow to win high output for the entire mine," breaking the convention that equipment maintenance and workface relocation inevitably reduced production, and achieving no reduction in production during maintenance and workface relocation. From May to December, the maintenance time in the entire mine increased more than fourfold compared to January to April, while the production level increased by 11% compared to January to April.

　　Due to the substantial increase in coal production, it is necessary to continuously increase transportation capacity and promptly adjust and resolve the contradiction between production and transportation in order to guarantee the increase in coal production. Therefore, the mine Party Committee has consistently regarded improving transportation capacity as the central link in ensuring good coal production in the past two years. In each period, it has regarded the weak links between production and transportation as the main direction of the technological revolution. From improving the hoisting capacity of the wellhead to reforming ground transportation, and from ground transportation reform to underground transportation, one link is connected to another, and the overall transportation capacity is comprehensively improved. At present, the daily transportation capacity is more than 2,200 tons higher than in the past, ensuring that as much as is produced is transported out.

　　While focusing on production, arranging the lives of the workers is a task that the Yingcheng Coal Mine Party Committee often values in leading coal production.

　　With the high-speed development of the mine's production, the enterprise leadership is paying more detailed and thorough attention to the lives of the workers. As early as the beginning of this year, the mine Party Committee drew a deputy secretary, a deputy mine manager, and the chairman of the trade union to form a leading group to specifically focus on the workers' lives and education. In order to build more housing for the miners, the Party Committee used all the investment approved by the state for building offices to build workers' dormitories. Now, the main leading comrades of the Party Committee are still crammed into a few narrow rooms that used to be used as substations for office work. In dealing with the lives of the workers, the coal mine Party Committee shared weal and woe with the workers, especially in the most difficult times. This greatly stimulated the labor enthusiasm of the workers. (Attached picture)

### 正确处理生产和基建、掘进、运输、生活四方面的关系  营城煤矿优质高产庆丰收

    正确处理生产和基建、掘进、运输、生活四方面的关系
    营城煤矿优质高产庆丰收
    据新华社长春29日电　吉林省营城煤矿党委正确处理了煤矿生产中的生产和建设、生产和准备、生产和运输、生产和生活等方面的关系，今年11月20日，已超额完成了产量、质量、掘进、销售等计划指标。
    营城矿党委在抓生产，积极改造原有矿井，尽量扩大生产的同时，放手发动群众，进行了地质勘探，并采取边勘探、边设计、边建设的方针，在两年多的时间内，开工新建了五对矿井。这些矿井全部投入生产后，可使全矿生产能力比现有水平提高一倍。
    生产建设同时抓的结果，1958年以来，这个矿平均年产量的递增率是32.4％。今年又比去年增长36.5％。
    以采煤推动掘进，以掘进保证采煤，是营城煤矿领导工作上经常调整的又一个关系。经常以两个到三个掘进掌子保一个采煤掌子，这是这个矿正确处理采掘关系的重要措施。但是如何正确处理采掘之间的关系，开始并不是所有领导干部都很明确的。有人担心：“采煤太快了掘进跟不上，吃掉老本怎么办”。他们主张以采等掘。营城煤矿党委不断批判了这种消极平衡思想，坚持了
  “以采带掘，以掘保采”采掘并举的积极方针。结果今年全矿的掘进组数由去年的五十三个增到一百多个，全矿掘进进米比去年增长了29.4％，准备工作面的可采量一直保持在六个月左右，适应了生产持续跃进的需要。
    这个煤矿为了争取时间给国家多产煤炭，还摸索出一条解决生产和设备检修之间存在矛盾的经验。
    过去都是逢年过节或每个月规定的时间进行检修，检修时就要停产，为此，一年就要少产十万多吨煤。而且因为各单位都赶到年节检修，项目多，面又广，人力物力无法集中使用，结果必然是检修时间长，质量低。从今年5月份起，矿党委仔细地分析了这个矛盾，为了做到检修、生产两不误，在每次检修中都是一面周密安排检修计划，做好检修前一切准备工作；一面在检修前一天发动工人集中全力出煤，把当天的生产准备工作推迟到检修期间进行，使检修前有充分时间抓产量。检修当天，生产工人又利用检修空隙作高产准备，检修后再组织高产。在检修期间，他们又以检修为动力，发动了“你检修，我支援，我搬家，你高产，誓夺全矿高产”的群众运动，破除了过去设备检修、工作面搬家必减产的常规，做到了检修和掌子面搬家不减产。全矿5月至12月，检修时间比1至4月份增加了四倍多，而生产水平却比1至4月提高了11％。
    由于煤炭生产大幅度增长，必须不断增加运输能力，及时调整和解决生产和运输之间的矛盾，才能保证煤炭的增产。因此矿党委这两年一直把提高运输能力当作搞好煤炭生产的中心环节。每个时期都把生产和运输之间出现的薄弱环节，作为技术革命的主攻方向。从提高井口提升能力到改革地面运输，又从地面运输改革到井下运输，一环扣一环，进行全面提高运输能力。目前，每天的运输能力比过去提高两千二百多吨，做到了生产多少，就运出多少。
    在抓生产的同时，安排好职工生活，是营城煤矿党委在领导煤炭生产中经常重视的工作。
    随着全矿生产事业的高速度发展，企业领导上对职工生活的关心也更加细致和更加周密。矿党委早在今年年初，就抽出一名副书记、一名副矿长和工会主席组成领导小组专门抓职工生活和职工教育工作。为了给矿工们修建更多的住宅，党委把国家批准盖办公室的投资，全部用于修建工人宿舍，到现在党委各个主要领导同志还挤在过去用做变电所的几间狭窄的房子里办公。在处理职工生活过程中，这个煤矿党委越是在最困难时，越和职工同甘共苦。因而大大激发了广大工人的劳动热情。（附图片）
