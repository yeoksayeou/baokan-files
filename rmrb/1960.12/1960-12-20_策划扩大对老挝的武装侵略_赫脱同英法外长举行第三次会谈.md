    Herter Holds Third Meeting with British and French Foreign Ministers
    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 19th: U.S. Secretary of State Herter continued his talks with the British and French foreign ministers in Paris on the 18th regarding the situation in Laos. This is the third meeting held by the three Western foreign ministers on the same issue within four days.
    According to the Associated Press, the United States raised the issue of how to "help" America's "friends in Laos" and how to obstruct the resumption of work by the International Commission for Laos, which was established in accordance with the Geneva Accords. The American news agency pointed out that the series of meetings between the three foreign ministers clearly shows that "the United States is determined to fully support" the traitorous Phoumi-Boun Oum clique's illegal government.

    策划扩大对老挝的武装侵略
    赫脱同英法外长举行第三次会谈
    据新华社19日讯　巴黎消息：美国国务卿赫脱18日在巴黎继续同英、法两国外交部长就老挝局势进行了会谈。这是西方三国外长在四天内就同一个问题举行的第三次会谈。
    据美联社透露，会谈中美国曾经提出如何“帮助”美国“在老挝的朋友”和如何阻挠根据日内瓦协议而建立的老挝国际委员会恢复工作的问题。这家美国通讯社指出，三国外长一系列的会谈清楚表明，“美国决定全力支持”富米—文翁叛国集团的非法政府。
