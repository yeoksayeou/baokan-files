    匈男女乒乓球队结束在上海的访问比赛
    新华社上海10日电　匈牙利布达佩斯男女乒乓球队9日晚在上海与上海市男、女乒乓球二队举行访沪的最后一次友谊比赛，结果客队男女队分别以五比二和三比一获胜。
    女子团体赛比较紧张，四场中有两场打了三局才分胜负。其中匈牙利名将玛特对李赫男的一场打得很精彩。横握球拍的玛特一开始就不断用正、反手抽球展开进攻，以五比二占先。李赫男一面把对方抽过来的球回过去，一面见机进攻，比数逐渐上升，最后以二十二比二十的接近比分取胜。第二局李赫男以同样的战术又赢了玛特。
    主队的林慧卿在对今年欧洲女子单打亚军克雷克斯和玛特的两场单打，分别以一比二和零比二失败。李赫男和沈爱如同玛特和高基安的双打，也是以一比二失败。
    在男子团体赛中，客队经验丰富的去年世界男子单打亚军西多一共打了三场，以二比一的比数分别胜了屠汉刚和刘国璋，但以零比二败给了我国著名的乒乓球选手王传耀的弟弟王传琪。
    今年的欧洲男子单打亚军福尔迪打了两场，以一比二败于刘国璋；而以二比一胜了屠汉刚。
    客队的另一名选手、匈牙利单打第四名皮格尼茨基，分别以二比零和二比一赢了王传琪和屠汉刚。
    客队已经结束了在上海的访问比赛，10日离开上海回北京，预定13日和14日在北京举行访华最后两次友谊比赛。截至目前，客队男女队已经在我国分别进行了七次友谊比赛，男子队的战绩是二胜五负；女子队是五胜二负。
