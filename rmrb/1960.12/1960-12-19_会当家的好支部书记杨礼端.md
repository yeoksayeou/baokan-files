    Yang Liduan, a Good Party Branch Secretary Who Knows How to Manage a Household
    By Our Correspondent Lǐ Jìntǐng
    I lived with the commune members in the Tenth Production Team of the Huangshajie Commune's Golden Brigade in Yueyang, Hunan, for a few days. During those days, I heard many stories from the masses praising the Party Branch Secretary Yang Liduan. Everyone said that Yang Liduan is a good cadre who is good at implementing the Party's policies, consults with everyone about matters, and knows how to manage a household.

    Relying on Experienced Farmers for Advice
    One morning, I went to the fields to dig sweet potatoes with the commune members. While digging sweet potatoes, we talked about sweet potatoes. The commune members said: "The autumn sweet potatoes are growing so well, all thanks to Lao Yang's leadership." But Yang Liduan said: "No, it's mainly thanks to the Party and the commune members. If the Party hadn't proposed discussing production plans and technical measures with everyone, getting their ideas, and listening to the experienced farmers, we wouldn't have such good autumn sweet potatoes!"
    From the conversation between the commune members and Yang Liduan, I learned a story about sweet potatoes: It turned out that since the beginning of June this year, they had been fighting drought, achieving a bumper harvest of early and mid-season rice. After harvesting the mid-season rice, they had to immediately transplant late-season rice, but it still didn't rain. It looked like they wouldn't be able to complete the planned thirty mu of late-season rice. What to do? Yang Liduan consulted with the commune members. The commune members all advocated continuing to fight the drought. They used waterwheels to fight the drought and managed to transplant a portion of the late-season rice. There were still more than twenty mu that were too dry and couldn't be transplanted. What to do? Experienced farmer Zhou Futao said: "More rice if it rains, sweet potatoes if it doesn't rain." He even took a hoe and dug dozens of times in the fields, and every hoe-full was hard, dry soil. Zhou Futao pointed to the hard, dry soil and said to the cadres: "It's so dry, we'll have to fight the drought when transplanting late-season rice, and we'll have to continue fighting the drought after transplanting. It takes more labor, and we won't have enough time. If we plant sweet potatoes, we only need to fight the drought when planting. Three thousand seedlings per mu, yielding two thousand jin of potatoes, equivalent to five hundred jin of grain, how good!" Most people agreed with this well-founded proposal from the experienced farmer. The team committee adopted this suggestion and expanded the autumn sweet potato planting by twenty-eight mu, and every mu grew well.
    There are several experienced farmers like Zhou Futao who are united around Yang Liduan. They are all Yang Liduan's good advisors, and Yang Liduan relies on them in everything. This spring, Yang Liduan convened a meeting of experienced farmers. Before the meeting, he first invited them to inspect the production. The experienced farmers saw that the rape, wheat, and broad beans were all growing well, and everyone was smiling. At the same time, they made many suggestions. They said: "There is too much rain in the spring, and drainage ditches should be opened in the broad bean and rape fields, otherwise the seedlings will be in danger of being waterlogged; when it rains and we can't work, we should seize the time to repair the farm tools in preparation for emergencies," and so on. Yang Liduan took these suggestions to the team committee for discussion, and everyone said that the experienced farmers' suggestions were good and timely. They immediately worked out some solutions and implemented them.

    Patiently Helping Cadres Improve Their Leadership Level
    Inviting experienced farmers to be consultants is not the only trick to Yang Liduan's good work. In his work, he is also good at cultivating cadres and helping them improve their work abilities. The production team he is in has two work groups, and the leaders are all young people. Their advantages are that they listen to the Party and are highly motivated, but their working methods are relatively simple, and sometimes they are a bit impatient.
    For example, the first group leader, Ma Shanxian, can do the work of two people; however, he is not careful enough in his work, and he only says a few words when explaining policies. During the spring plowing this year, he arranged for a young woman, Zhou Shuhua, to spread fertilizer in the paddy field. Zhou Shuhua said: "I can't go today, I need to ask for leave." Ma Shanxian didn't ask for the reason and insisted that Zhou Shuhua go to the field to spread fertilizer. When Zhou Shuhua was in a dilemma, Yang Liduan happened to arrive. When he heard Zhou Shuhua's tone, he knew that she was having her period, so he arranged for her to help the canteen cook, and he himself carried the harrow to spread fertilizer. Ma Shanxian didn't understand the situation and was angry in the field, blaming Zhou Shuhua for disobeying orders. At that time, Yang Liduan didn't criticize Ma Shanxian. After spreading the fertilizer and plowing the field, on the way back from work, he asked Ma Shanxian: "Why didn't Zhou Shuhua go to spread fertilizer?" Ma Shanxian couldn't answer. When Yang Liduan explained the reason to him, he regretted not understanding the situation. Yang Liduan patiently told him: "A work group leader, to lead production well, must understand everyone's thoughts and concerns, and care about their specific difficulties. You must never be simplistic. Only by caring for everyone can you lead well and win battles."
    Another time, Yang Liduan went to the first group to inspect production and found that commune member Wu Hongnan was plowing the field quickly but not focusing on quality. When he came back, he asked Ma Shanxian: "How many mu did Wu Hongnan plow?" He replied eight mu; but when asked about the quality, he couldn't answer. Yang Liduan then led Ma Shanxian to inspect the field in person. After seeing it, he became impatient and advocated holding a meeting to criticize him, but Yang Liduan stopped him. Later, the two of them invited Wu Hongnan to inspect the field together. When Wu Hongnan saw that the quality of others' plowing was better than his own, he automatically offered to rework the field the next day. Through this incident, Yang Liduan told Ma Shanxian again that leading production not only requires taking the lead, but also being meticulous and thorough; when dealing with the shortcomings of commune members, don't criticize at every turn, but persuade with reason and solve problems ideologically. With Yang Liduan's help, Ma Shanxian's working methods have changed. Now, he consults with the masses about everything, inspects production once a day, is kind to people, and is praised by the commune members.
    Thanks to Yang Liduan's patient help, the leadership level and work ability of the cadres in this production team have improved to varying degrees. The bookkeeper Yin Zhenhua, for example, couldn't keep accounts well a year ago, but now he can not only keep clear accounts, but also takes the initiative in his work, announcing the commune members' completion of labor quotas at noon and in the evening. All eleven team committee members have received Yang Liduan's help, and Yang Liduan has also learned many things from everyone.

    Seriously Studying the Party's Policies
    One evening as I was leaving this production team, after the bookkeeper had clarified the day's work points, Yang Liduan invited the team cadres to his home to study the Party's policies. That day, they read the Party's various policies on the people's communes. The one reading the policies to everyone was their team's "intellectual," Liu Zhongcheng. He is twenty-one years old, finished elementary school, is the militia platoon leader, and is also responsible for reading newspapers and other work. After each policy is announced, he copies it into his notebook one by one, and explains it to the cadres and commune members whenever he has time.
    They read each one, and connected each one to reality for discussion. The more they discussed, the clearer everyone became. Yang Liduan said with emotion: "In the past, the Party wanted us to do something, and we did it; but we often didn't understand clearly why we were doing it. Therefore, when we encountered difficulties in our work, we felt overwhelmed; sometimes, although the work tasks were completed, the masses were not satisfied. Where was the reason? We couldn't figure it out for a long time. Through this study, we finally understood." Everyone nodded in agreement with this remark.
    After everyone left, I asked Yang Liduan: "Do you have such study meetings often?" He smiled and said: "Since this year, there have always been one or two every ten days. How can we work without studying the policies?"

### 会当家的好支部书记杨礼端

    会当家的好支部书记杨礼端
    本报记者　李进挺
    在湖南岳阳黄沙街公社黄金大队第十生产队，和社员一起生活了几天。几天中，听到了不少群众夸赞支部书记杨礼端的故事。大家说杨礼端是个善于贯彻执行党的政策、有事跟大家商量、会当家的好干部。
    依靠老农出谋划策
    一天早上，到地里去和社员一道挖红薯。挖着红薯，也就谈起红薯的事来。社员们说：秋红薯长得这样好，这都是老杨领导有方。而杨礼端却说：“不，主要是靠党，靠社员。要不是党提出把生产计划和技术措施交给大家讨论、出主意，听老农的话，就不会有这样的好秋红薯！”
    从社员与杨礼端的谈话中，我打听到一个关于红薯的故事：原来从今年6月初起，他们就抗旱，取得了早中稻的丰收。收完中稻，紧接着就得插晚稻，但天还是不下雨，眼看包产的三十亩晚稻完不成计划。怎么办？杨礼端便与社员商量。社员们都主张继续抗旱。用车水抗旱的办法，抢插了一部分晚稻。还有二十多亩，实在无水，插不下。怎么办？老农周福涛说：“落雨多插谷，不落雨插红薯。”他还拿了锄头，到田间挖了几十锄，锄锄都是干硬的泥土。周福涛指着干硬的泥土，对干部说：“干旱成这样了，插晚稻时要抗旱，插上了还要抗旱，多花工，时间又来不及。要是插红薯，插时抗一下旱就行了。一亩插三千蔸，收两千斤薯，折五百斤谷，多好！”老农这种有根有据的主张，大多数人都同意。队委会采纳了这一意见，扩大了二十八亩秋红薯，亩亩长得都好。
    团结在杨礼端周围，像周福涛这样的老农，有好几个。他们都是杨礼端的好参谋，杨礼端也处处依靠他们。今年春天，杨礼端召开了一次老农会。会前，先请他们参观了一下生产。老农们看见油菜、小麦、蚕豆样样长得好，个个喜笑颜开，同时提出了许多意见。他们说：春天雨水太多，蚕豆和油菜田里要开排水沟，不然，苗就有浸坏的危险；雨天出不了工，要抓紧时间检修好农具，以备急用，等等。杨礼端把这些意见，拿到队委会上讨论，大家都说老农们的意见提得好，提得早，随即研究出了一些办法，付诸实施。
    耐心帮助干部提高领导水平
    聘请老农当顾问，并不是杨礼端工作搞得好的全部窍门。在工作中，他还善于培养干部，帮助他们提高工作能力。他所在的生产队，有两个作业组，组长都是青年人。他们的优点是听党的话，干劲大，但工作方法比较简单，有时有点性急。
    比如一组组长马山仙，干起活来一人顶两人；做起工作来却不够细致，讲政策也只有几句话。今年春耕时，他安排女青年周淑华去水田撒粪。周淑华说：今天去不得，要请假。马山仙不问清原因，硬要周淑华下田撒粪。周淑华正在左右为难时，碰巧杨礼端来到。他一听周淑华的口气，知道她是来了月经，便安排她去帮食堂作菜，自己扛起耙头去撒粪。马山仙不明白情由，一直在田间生气，怪周淑华不听指挥。当时，杨礼端没有批评马山仙。等撒完粪，犁完田，在收工的路上，才问马山仙：周淑华为什么不去撒粪？马山仙回答不出。当杨礼端给他说明原因时，他才后悔自己不了解情况。杨礼端耐心地告诉他：一个作业组长，要领导好生产，就得了解每个人的思想情况，关心他们的具体困难，决不能简单从事。只有关心大家，才能带好兵，打胜仗。
    又一次，杨礼端到一组去检查生产，发现社员吴红南犁田只图快，不讲质量。他回来问马山仙：吴红南犁了多少田？他回答是八亩；但问到质量，便答不上来。杨礼端便领马山仙亲自去看。他看了以后，便急躁起来，主张开会批评，但被杨礼端制止了。后来，他们两个人邀请吴红南一道到田里检查，当吴红南看到别人犁的质量比自己好时，便自动提出第二天返工。通过这件事，杨礼端又告诉马山仙，领导生产不仅要带头干，而且要细致深入；对待社员的缺点，不要动不动就批评，而要以理服人，从思想上解决问题。经过杨礼端的帮助，马山仙的工作方法改变了。现在，他遇事都和群众商量，每天检查一次生产，待人和气，受到社员称赞。
    由于杨礼端的耐心帮助，这个生产队干部的领导水平和工作能力，都有不同程度的提高。像记工员尹振华，一年前还记不好账，现在他不但能记清账，而且工作主动，每天中午和晚上，分别公布社员完成劳动定额的情况。十一个队委，个个都得到杨礼端的帮助，而杨礼端也向大家学习了许多东西。
    认真学习党的政策
    我离开这个生产队的一个傍晚，等记工员把当天的工分弄清楚以后，杨礼端便邀请队干部到他家里去学习党的政策。这天，读的是党关于人民公社的各项政策。读政策给大家听的，是他们队里的“文化人”柳忠诚。他二十一岁，读过完小，是民兵班长，同时负责读报等工作。每项政策公布后，他都一条条抄在本子上，有空就讲给干部和社员听。
    一条条读，一条条联系实际进行讨论。越讨论，大家心里越亮。杨礼端感慨地说：“过去，党要我们做甚么，我们就做甚么；可是为什么要这样做，我们心里往往不大明确。因此，当工作中遇到困难，就感到压头；有时工作任务虽然完成了，但群众不满意。原因在哪里呢？很久闹不清。通过这次学习，才明白了”。这一席话，大家都点头赞成。
    人散了，我问杨礼端：“这样的学习会经常开吗？”他笑着说：“今年以来，每十天总有一两次。不学习政策，怎么能工作呢？”（附图片）
