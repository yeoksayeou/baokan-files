    A Street in Lhasa
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Bi Yuehua
    Hebalin Street, an ordinary street in Lhasa, has undergone tremendous changes in the past year, just like other streets.

    This street, more than four miles long, stretches from the Bajiao Street intersection in the city center to the Lhasa River Bridge. The north and south sides of the street are managed by two residents' committees, with a total of more than 180 households and more than 900 residents. Walking along the street, one sees a scene of peace, prosperity, and vigor. The streets are swept very clean by the residents, and the former muddy pools and sewage pits are now shaded by green trees, and various flowers have been planted in many places. The rhythmic sound of sewing machines, the crisp sound of blacksmithing, and the joyful labor songs of the residents are heard from both sides of the street and from the alleys. All this may seem unremarkable to those who do not understand the past of Lhasa, but the old residents here say: "Our place has changed from hell to heaven."

    More than a year ago, more than 20 large aristocratic families lived on this street. Traitorous ringleaders such as Suokang Wangqing Geller, Xianka Jumei Dorje, Yutuo Zashi Dunzhu, and Pala Tuben Weideng all gathered on this street. They were tyrannical and oppressed the people, turning this place into the darkest corner of feudal serf society. On one side were the stone buildings of these reactionary large serf owners and their extravagant and licentious lives; on the other side were the groans of beggars under the walls and the screams of slaves from deep inside the houses. Children and stray dogs competed for food on the garbage heaps. The triangular area in front of the mosque, the main trading market on this street, used to be the most noisy and chaotic place, with more than 20 opium dens, taverns, and brothels. People passing by could smell the alcohol from drunkards from afar, hear the scolding of pedestrians whose property had been stolen, and the clinking of silver dollars from speculative merchants.

    A great democratic revolution washed away all these dark and filthy things. What is presented to people today are new people, new lives, and the new spiritual outlook of the people.

    As soon as the rebellion in the Lhasa area was quelled, the masses on this street, with the help of the staff of the People's Government, established a residents' committee. More than 30 former slaves and serfs were elected as group leaders and members of the residents' committee to manage the street's production, civil affairs, culture, education, health, and public welfare. They are all new figures who emerged after the democratic reform. Losang Dengba, who had been a "Lang Sheng" (domestic slave) for landlords for more than 30 years, is now 58 years old. Since becoming a member of the residents' committee, he has either been publicizing the Party's policies or going deep into the masses to conduct family visits to help the masses arrange their lives and solve difficulties. In July of this year, on a rainy day, he accidentally slipped and fell down the stairs, bruising his back and unable to straighten up. Even at this time, he was still thinking about the unfinished work. Unable to get out of bed, he propped himself up with a pillow and helped the masses with writing and calculations. When other committee members advised him to rest, he always replied: "The Communist Party helped me stand up and become the master. As long as I have a bit of strength, I will contribute it to the Party and the people without reservation."

    The area in front of the mosque, which used to be the most noisy and chaotic, has now become the most concentrated place for handicraft production, with eleven mutual aid groups in eight industries closely adjacent to each other. All of the more than 350 handicraft workers here have joined mutual aid groups. Under the leadership and support of the Party and the People's Government, they have developed production and improved their lives. Former thieves, prostitutes, etc., now also have legitimate occupations. In early July, the first handicraft production cooperative on the Tibetan plateau, the "July 1st" Iron and Wood Production Cooperative, appeared. This cooperative was developed from a group of five goldsmiths and silversmiths. In the old society, these goldsmiths and silversmiths bent over all year round to make jewelry for the nobles, living in cold and solitude, unable to maintain a basic living. The current cooperative faces production and the working people, and its production has developed extremely rapidly. When the cooperative was first established on "July 1st" this year, it had only more than 50 people, but now it has increased to 88 people.

    In just over three months, the workers have trial-produced nearly a hundred new products and manufactured and repaired 30,000 pieces of agricultural tools. The cooperative's storefront is undergoing its fifth expansion since its establishment.

    While handicraft production is developing rapidly, the cultural and welfare undertakings on this street are also constantly being established. Under the guidance and help of the People's Government, the street residents' committee has established three primary schools, and almost all school-age children have enrolled. Adults also have places to learn culture. As soon as it gets dark, women go in groups to women's literacy classes to study, and men go more often to the reading room on this street to read books and newspapers. Young men and women also participate in amateur song and dance troupes. Public welfare facilities such as bathhouses and barber shops have also been established one after another, and residents have begun to develop the habit of cleanliness.

    But the biggest change is in the spiritual outlook of the people. Now here, mutual care in case of illness and mutual assistance in case of difficulties have become commonplace. During a stormy night in August, at the home of Silang Dajie at No. 111 Hebalin Street, the long-neglected and unrepaired houses had water accumulation of two or three inches deep, and there was a danger of collapse. Just at this critical moment, neighbors Solang Duobuje and Baima Lamu and others rushed to the scene upon hearing the news. Seven or eight people, some with basins and some with ladles, worked until midnight to remove the accumulated water. Early the next morning, they came to help carry soil to repair the house, and soon the house was repaired. Among these neighbors who came to help, there was one named Solang Duobuje, who had been on bad terms with Silang Dajie for the past few years and did not speak to each other when they met. This time, he came to help voluntarily and was very active, as if he were working for his own family.

    拉萨一条街
    新华社记者  毕月华
    拉萨市的一条普通街道——河坝林街，和其他街道一样，一年来已经发生了巨大的变化。
    这条四里多长的街道，从市中心的八角街口一直伸延到拉萨河大桥，街道南北分别属于两个居民委员会管理，共有居民一百八十多户，九百多人。沿街走去，看到的是一片安居乐业欣欣向荣的景象。街道被居民们打扫得十分干净，过去的烂泥塘和污水坑，如今已绿树成荫，不少地方还栽培了各种花卉。缝纫机有节奏的响声、清脆的打铁声和居民们欢乐的劳动歌声，从街道两侧和小巷里阵阵传来。这一切，对于不了解拉萨的过去的人，看起来平淡无奇，但是这里的老住户说：“我们这里从地狱变成了天堂。”
    一年多以前，这条街上住着二十多户大贵族。叛国头子索康·旺清格勒、先喀·居美多杰、宇妥·扎西顿珠、帕拉·土登为登等等大贵族都聚居在这条街上，他们横行霸道，欺压人民，把这里造成了封建农奴社会里最黑暗的一角。一方面是这些反动大农奴主的石砌高楼，和他们荒淫奢侈的生活；另方面是墙角下乞丐的呻吟，深宅里传出的奴隶们的惨叫声。垃圾堆上，孩子和野狗争食。在这条街上的主要交易市场——清真寺门前的三角地带，过去是最嘈杂混乱的地方，烟馆、酒馆、妓院等就有二十多家。人们走过这里，远远就能闻到醉汉的酒气，听到被窃财物的行人的叫骂以及投机商人敲大洋的叮当声。
    一场伟大的民主革命，把这些黑暗、污浊的东西都冲洗掉了，今天展现在人们眼前的，是新生的人，新的生活，和人们新的精神面貌。
    拉萨地区的叛乱一平息，这条街的群众便在人民政府工作人员的帮助下，成立了居民委员会，三十多个原来的奴隶和农奴，被选为居民委员会的组长和委员，管理这条街的生产、民政和文教卫生、公共福利等。他们都是在民主改革后涌现出来的新的人物。曾经给领主当了三十多年“朗生”（家奴）的洛桑登巴，今年已经五十八岁了，自从当了居民委员以后，不是宣传党的政策，就是深入群众进行家庭访问，帮助群众安排生活，解决困难。今年7月一个雨天，他不慎失足从楼梯上滑下，背上摔得青一块、紫一块，直不起腰来。就在这时，他还念念不忘当时未做完的工作。他不能下床，就把枕头垫得高高的，半躺在床上帮助群众写和算。别的委员劝他休息，他总是这样回答：“共产党帮助我翻身做了主人，只要我有一分力量，也要毫无保留地贡献给党，贡献给人民。”
    过去最嘈杂混乱的清真寺门前一带，现在变成了手工业生产最集中的地方，八个行业的十一个互助组紧紧挨着。这里的三百五十多个手工业工人全部参加了互助组，他们在党和人民政府的领导和扶持下，发展了生产，改善了生活。过去的小偷、娼妓等，现在也都有了正当的职业。7月初，这里出现了西藏高原上第一个手工业生产合作社——“七一”铁木生产合作社，这个合作社是由五个金银匠组成的一个小组发展起来的。在旧社会，这些金银匠终年弯腰驼背地为贵族作首饰，冷冷清清，不能维持温饱。现在的合作社，面向生产，面向劳动人民，生产发展异常迅速。今年“七一”刚建社时还只有五十多人，现在已经增加到八十八人。
    工人们在三个多月中就试制成功了近百种新产品，制造和修理了三万多件农具。合作社的门面正在进行建社后的第五次扩建。
    在手工业生产迅速发展的同时，这条街的文化福利事业也不断创办起来。街道居民委员会已在人民政府的指导和帮助下，办起了三所小学，几乎所有的学龄儿童都入了学。成人们也有了学习文化的地方，一到天黑，妇女们就成群结队地到妇女识字班里学习，男人们更多的是到这条街上的阅览室里阅读书报，青年男女们还参加了业余歌舞队。洗澡堂、理发馆等公共福利设施也相继建立起来了，居民们都开始养成了爱清洁的习惯。
    但是变化最大的，还是人们的精神面貌。现在在这里，有病互相关怀，有困难互相帮助，已成为常事。8月间一个暴风雨的夜里，河坝林街一百一十一号的斯朗达杰家里，一间年久失修的房屋积水二、三寸深，眼看有倒塌的危险。正在这危急的时候，邻居索朗多不杰和白玛拉姆等闻讯赶来，七、八个人有的拿盆，有的拿瓢，一直忙到半夜才把积水除完。第二天一早，他们又来帮助背土修房，很快就把房子修好。在这些前来帮忙的邻居中，有一位名叫索朗多不杰，过去几年一直和斯朗达杰不和睦，见面不说话。这次他自动前来帮助，而且非常积极，就像为自己家里干活一样。
