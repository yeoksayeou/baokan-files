Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 12th: According to the magazine "Soviet Screen," the Moscow Film Studio in the Soviet Union attaches importance to filming movies that reflect the current lives of Soviet people. In the subject plan for the film production of 1961, which was recently drafted by the studio, it is stipulated that twenty out of the twenty-five feature films to be shot next year will adopt modern themes.

The magazine pointed out that these films will reflect the most important processes in Soviet social life. For example, "Communist Labor Brigade," directed by Yutkevich and written by Kapler, will reflect this broad movement of treating labor with a communist attitude; the film "How Could Such a Thing Happen," directed by Raizman and written by Olianski, will reflect the moral and ethical outlook of modern young people; and the film "Girls," written by Bedney and directed by Chuliukin, will focus on young lumberjacks.

Next year, the studio will also shoot films reflecting the current life of collective farms. The famous director Periev is preparing to shoot the film "She and Love Are For This" based on Loginov's novella, which narrates the life of the Kuban collective farm and reflects the important changes that have taken place in collective farm construction in recent years. The screenplay "Alenka," adapted from Antonov's novella, will be directed by Bar Ter, and is a film depicting land reclaimers.

In addition, the Moscow Film Studio will also shoot films on the theme of modern international issues. The famous director Roshal will direct the film "The Court of the Madmen," exposing the danger of neo-fascism in some capitalist countries. "Night Without Mercy," adapted from the novel by the West German writer Zandaniel, is also against the danger of a new war. The writer Leonov has finished writing the screenplay "Mr. Mark Kenry's Escape." This film reveals that it is futile for residents of a certain Western country to try to stand outside the active struggle against atomic and hydrogen weapon warfare.

    苏联莫斯科电影制片厂制订明年影片生产计划
    新华社莫斯科12日电　据《苏维埃银幕》杂志报道：苏联莫斯科电影制片厂重视拍摄反映苏联人当前生活的电影。这个制片厂在最近拟订的1961年影片生产的题材计划中规定，在明年拍摄的二十五部故事片中将有二十部采用现代题材。
    杂志指出，这些影片将反映苏联社会生活中最重要的过程。例如，尤特克维奇导演、卡普列尔创作的《共产主义劳动队》，将反映这个以共产主义态度对待劳动的广泛运动，由拉伊兹曼导演、奥利尚斯基编写的影片《怎么能发生这样的事》，将反映现代青年人的道德伦理面貌，别德内伊编剧、丘柳金导演的影片《姑娘们》则以青年伐木工人为主题。
    明年这个制片厂还将拍摄反映集体农庄当前生活的影片。著名导演佩里耶夫正根据洛吉诺夫的中篇小说准备拍摄影片《她和爱情是为了这》，影片叙述库班集体农庄的生活，反映最近几年在集体农庄建设中发生的重要变化。根据安东诺夫的中篇小说改编的电影剧本《阿连卡》将由巴尔?特导演，这是一部描写垦荒者的影片。
    此外，莫斯科电影制片厂还将拍摄以现代国际问题为主题的影片。著名导演罗沙尔将导演影片《狂人的法庭》，揭露在某些资本主义国家中出现的新法西斯主义的危险。根据西德作家桑达聂尔的长篇小说改编的《没有慈悲的夜》也是反对新战争危险的。作家列昂诺夫结束了电影剧本《马克·肯里先生的逃亡》的写作。这部影片揭示，某一个西方国家的居民企图站在反对原子和氢武器战争的积极斗争的外边是徒然的。
