Xinhua News Agency, December 25th. According to a TASS report on the 23rd, the Presidium of the Soviet Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee held an enlarged meeting in Moscow on the 23rd.

    The meeting reiterated its demand that imperialist countries cease their interference in the internal affairs of the Congo, immediately release Prime Minister Lumumba, and create conditions for the normal work of the Congo's legitimate government and parliament.

    The meeting condemned the United States and its Southeast Asia Treaty Organization partners for their blatant interference in the internal affairs of Laos. Participants at the meeting pointed out that the United States and Thailand have created a threat to peace in the Far East in this country.

    The resolution adopted at the meeting also demanded an immediate end to the bloody war being waged in Algeria and the granting of freedom and independence to the Algerian people.

    Soviet Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee supports the proposal of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization meeting held in Beirut in November of this year: namely, to advocate holding the Afro-Asian People's Conference in 1961.

    The Presidium of the Soviet Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee also decided to establish separate Asian and African committees. The chairmen of the two committees are Academician Gavrov, Corresponding Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and Potekhin, respectively.
