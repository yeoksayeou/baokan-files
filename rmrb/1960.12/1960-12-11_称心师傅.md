Attentive and Meticulous

	"Satisfactory Master"
	One day in October, as the workers of Tianjin Leather Factory arrived at the canteen, the cook Li Xuesheng was already delivering plates of stir-fried dishes, steaming hot steamed buns, jujube cakes, and hot noodle soup to them. The canteen was filled with laughter. However, Li Xuesheng noticed that the worker Ma Dahe hadn't come to eat. Upon inquiring, he learned that Ma Dahe was suffering from a cold. He immediately rushed to the workers' dormitory, kindly asking him at his bedside what he would like to eat. After returning to the canteen, he made a bowl of noodle soup with some added ginger and sent it to Ma Dahe.
	Li Xuesheng is a Communist Party member. Under the guidance of the Party, he deeply understands the importance of his work, wholeheartedly strives to run the canteen well, and is considerate and caring towards every worker. During the increase production and practice economy campaign, Li Xuesheng thought that the weather was getting colder, and workers who brought food from home needed someone to help them heat it up. One day at noon, he went to the workshop and saw some people using hot water to heat their meals. In his heart, he questioned himself: "Li Xuesheng, Li Xuesheng, you haven't done the work the Party entrusted to you very well!" From that moment on, he carried a basket to the workshop every day to collect the food brought by the workers, steamed it in the canteen, and then delivered it to everyone. Sometimes, the workers were busy with technical innovations and often didn't come to the canteen to eat on time, so he brought the food to the workshop and delivered it to the workers' hands. The workers were all happy to have such a "satisfactory master."

    “称心师傅”
    10月的一天，天津制革厂的职工们刚刚来到食堂，炊事员李学圣就把一盘盘的炒菜，热腾腾的馒头、小枣丝糕和热面汤，送到他们面前。食堂里笑语满堂。可是，李学圣发现工人马大河没有来吃饭。一打听，原来马大河正患感冒。他连忙奔向职工宿舍，到马大河床前亲切地询问他想吃什么。回到食堂后，他就做了一碗汤面，还加了点姜丝，送给马大河。
    李学圣是共产党员，他在党的教导下，深深地了解自己工作的重要意义，一心一意把食堂办好，体贴关心每个职工。增产节约运动中，李学圣想到天气越来越凉，从家中带饭的职工需要有人帮着热饭。一天中午，他到车间一转，果然看到有的人用开水冲热饭菜吃。他内心里就责问自己：“李学圣，李学圣，党交给你的工作没有很好完成啊！”从这时候起，他每天提着篮子到车间收集职工带来的饭菜，到食堂蒸热以后又给大家送去。有时，工人们大闹技术革新，往往不按时到食堂吃饭，他又把饭菜送进车间，送到工人们手里，工人们都因为有这样一位“称心师傅”而感到高兴。
