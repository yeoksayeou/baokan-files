    On "Protagonist" and "Supporting Role"
    Ding Chuqiao, Young Cook at Hankou Battery Factory

    In any play, there are protagonists and supporting roles. A play cannot be performed with only protagonists and no extras, and it cannot be performed well with only extras and no protagonists. This is a truth that everyone knows.

    However, some people only want to be protagonists and do not want to be supporting roles; they only want to be experts and engineers and do not want to be cooks and service personnel. Why is this? This is because their bourgeois worldview has not been well transformed, and they always divide people into "superior people" and "inferior people," and divide work into "important" and "unimportant." What they call important is when there is more money and greater fame.

    We revolutionaries believe that all revolutionaries are members of the revolutionary family, and there is no distinction between "noble" and "lowly" or "superior" and "inferior." Because socialist undertaking is a collective undertaking, and no aspect of the work can be lacking. Just like a machine cannot lack a screw. Take our cooking work, for example, which some people consider unimportant. But if there were no cooks to make meals for people in various positions, could they work without any worries? The old cook in the film "Ten Thousand Waters, Thousand Mountains," carried the pot for cooking for his comrades throughout the arduous march, and finally fell off a cliff and sacrificed his life for this pot. He is a person with a noble communist spirit, and therefore he is respected by the people. Wasn't Comrade Shi Chuanxiang, a Beijing sanitation worker, also present at the National "Congress of Heroes"? These are all jobs that people with bourgeois ideas consider to have no future, but for ordinary soldiers with communist ideas, no matter what job they are assigned, as long as the Party needs it and the revolutionary cause needs it, they feel supremely honored and give it their all.

    Chairman Mao said in "In Memory of Norman Bethune": "A man's ability may be great or small, but if he has this spirit, he is a noble person, a pure person, a moral person, a person who is free from vulgar interests, and a person who is beneficial to the people." The spirit that Chairman Mao referred to is the "spirit of utter devotion to others without any thought of self" of Bethune. Therefore, whether one is glorious or important does not depend on whether he is a "protagonist" or a "supporting role," but on whether he has eliminated "selfishness" and established a sense of responsibility as a master. If a person has not eliminated selfishness and has not established a sense of responsibility as a master, even if he is in the position of "protagonist" and is responsible for important work, he will still mess things up; conversely, if he has eliminated selfishness and established a sense of responsibility as a master, even if he is in the position of "supporting role" and is responsible for the most ordinary work, he can still achieve brilliant results.

    "Protagonist" and "supporting role" are relative terms, and the two are a unity of opposites, which can be transformed into each other under certain conditions. Our entire revolutionary cause is full of this repeated and frequent transformation process. For example, in the production of our factory, the workers in the production workshop play the "protagonist," and the cooks in the canteen play the "supporting role," but when people go to the canteen to eat, the cooks become the "protagonist" of the canteen. Therefore, it can be said that in our revolutionary cause, everyone is a "protagonist," and everyone should establish a sense of responsibility as a master. At the same time, everyone is a "supporting role," and everyone serves the people. Therefore, the most critical issue is to transform our standpoint and worldview, and truly establish the "spirit of utter devotion to others without any thought of self" like Bethune.

### 论“主角”与“配角”

    论“主角”与“配角”
    汉口电池厂青年炊事员　丁楚桥
    不管演什么戏，都有主角和配角。光有主角没有跑龙套的，戏就演不成，光有跑龙套的没有主角，同样是演不好戏的。这是人人都知道的道理。
    但是，有些人却只愿当主角，不愿当配角；只愿当专家和工程师，不愿当炊事员和服务员。这是什么缘故呢？这是因为他们的资产阶级世界观还没有得到很好的改造，他们总是把人分成“上等人”和“下等人”，把工作分成“重要的”和“不重要”的。他们所说的重要，就是钱多名气大。
    我们革命者却认为，所有的革命者都是革命大家庭中的一员，根本没有什么“贵贱”和“上下”之分。因为社会主义事业是集体的事业，缺少那一个方面的工作也不行。就像一部机器不能缺少一颗螺丝钉一样。就拿我们炊事工作来说，在有些人看来是不重要的。但是，假使没有炊事员给在各个岗位上的人做饭吃，他们能无牵无挂的工作吗？电影《万水千山》中的老炊事员，在艰苦的行军过程中，他一直背着那口给同志们做饭的锅子，最后终于为了这口锅坠下山崖，牺牲了自己的生命。他是具有高尚的共产主义风格的人，因而也就受到人民的尊敬。北京的粪便清除工人时传祥同志，不是也出席过全国的“群英会”吗？这都是具有资产阶级思想的人认为没有出息的工作，可是对于具有共产主义思想的普通战士，不论担负什么工作，只要党需要，革命事业需要，他们都感到无上光荣，都是全力以赴的。
    毛主席在《纪念白求恩》一文里说过：“一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”毛主席所指的那种精神，就是白求恩那种“毫无自私自利之心的精神”。因此，是不是光荣，是不是重要，关键并不在于他是“主角”还是“配角”，而在于他是不是清除了“自私自利之心”，是不是树立了主人翁的责任感。一个人，要是他没有去掉自私自利之心，没有树立主人翁的责任感，他就是站在“主角”的岗位上，担负着重要的工作，也会把事情办糟的；反之，如果去掉了自私自利之心，树立了主人翁的责任感，就是站在“配角”的岗位上，担负着最平凡的工作，也能做出光辉的成绩来。
    “主角”与“配角”，是相对而言的，两者是对立的统一，在一定的条件下是会互相转化的。在我们整个革命事业中，就充满着这种反复的频繁的转化过程。譬如在我们工厂的生产中，唱“主角”的是生产车间的工人，唱“配角”的是食堂的炊事员，但是，当人们到食堂吃饭的时候，炊事员就变成了食堂的“主角”。因此可以说，在我们的革命事业中，人人都是“主角”，人人都应该树立起主人翁的责任感。同时，人人又都是“配角”，人人都是为人民服务的。因此，最关键的问题，还是改造我们的立场和世界观，真正树立像白求恩那种“毫无自私自利之心的精神”。
