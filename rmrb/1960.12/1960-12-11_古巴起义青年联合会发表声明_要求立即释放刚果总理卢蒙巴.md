Xinhua News Agency, Havana, December 9th. The Cuban Revolutionary Youth Union today issued a statement demanding "respect for Lumumba's life and his immediate release." The statement also protested the imperialist plot to maintain its exploitative rule over the African people.

The statement pointed out that "the oppression and exploitation of the African people maintained by privileged and monopoly groups has been directly manifested in actions endangering the person of Lumumba, who represents the Congolese people's desire for liberation from being turned into a colony and occupied by imperialist armies." The statement emphasized that "Cuban youth are watching the struggle of the African and Congolese people. We want to support the struggle of African youth for liberation and complete independence." The Cuban Revolutionary Youth Union also sent a telegram to the Secretary-General of the United Nations to protest to him.
