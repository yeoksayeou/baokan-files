Comrade Chairman, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, Bainqen Erdini Qoigyijabu, and esteemed members:

I now represent the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region in reporting to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on the main progress of various tasks in Tibet in 1960.

1960 was the third year of continuous leap forward in China's socialist construction. Over the past year, under the wise and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of all fraternal nationalities across the country, holding high the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, have been working hard, relying on their own efforts, and with greater revolutionary vigor, engaging in technical revolution and technical innovation on all fronts of socialist construction, enabling China's socialist construction to achieve sustained high-speed development and enter a new stage of development. Over the past year, various tasks in the Tibet region, like those in other parts of the country, have achieved a sustained leap forward on the basis of the great achievements made in various tasks last year.

In April this year, the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region held the Fourth Enlarged Session of the Committee, reviewed and summarized the work in various aspects such as quelling the rebellion and democratic reform in 1959, and discussed and formulated the work tasks for 1960. According to the instructions of the Central Committee and the actual situation in Tibet, the work tasks in the Tibet region in 1960 were: while continuing to fully mobilize the masses, completing the democratic reform, and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, vigorously develop agricultural production, conscientiously do a good job in establishing people's democratic power, training ethnic minority cadres, developing financial and trade, transportation and communication, and various construction undertakings in culture, education, and health. Over the past year, under the wise and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, and Party committees and people's governments at all levels, conscientiously implemented the Party's various policies; cadres at all levels and people of all strata united as one, carried forward the spirit of hard struggle, and actively and diligently carried out various tasks, successfully completing the above-mentioned work tasks and achieving new and greater achievements.

(I)

In terms of democratic reform, the specific tasks for 1960 were: in agricultural areas where democratic reform had not yet been carried out in 1959, continue to carry out the democratic reform movement and complete the land reform work in a planned and step-by-step manner. In areas where land reform has already been carried out, in conjunction with vigorously developing agricultural production, adopt the principle of "no delay in production review," conduct a review of democratic reform, to further fully mobilize the masses, handle the outstanding issues in the reform, consolidate the achievements of the democratic reform, and create the necessary good conditions for future development of production and construction and gradually carrying out socialist transformation. The guiding principle of reform review is to check and correct simultaneously, and build while correcting. The content of the reform review is: 1. Check whether the land distribution is not reasonable enough; 2. Check whether the feudal serf system has been thoroughly destroyed; 3. Check whether the advantage of the masses has been completely established; 4. Check whether the production mutual aid movement is developing normally; 5. Check whether the work style of some cadres is not thorough enough and whether their position is not firm enough; 6. Check whether the "three antis and three calculations" of the monasteries are thorough; 7. Check the implementation of the redemption policy.

In continuing to carry out democratic reform and reform review, we continued to implement the various policies of the Central Committee for democratic reform in Tibet. That is, while fully mobilizing the masses, conscientiously do a good job in the united front work of the upper strata, protect and help patriotic and progressive upper strata figures to pass the democratic reform test well; treat serf owners and serf owner agents who rebelled and did not rebel differently; thoroughly abolish the feudal privileges, feudal exploitation, and feudal oppression system of monasteries in monasteries, conscientiously implement the Party's policy of freedom of religious belief, protect patriotic and law-abiding Buddhists, protect legitimate religious activities, and protect the political rights and the right to freedom of religious belief of monks and nuns; protect the cultural relics and historical sites of monasteries; resolutely combat counter-revolutionary activities and all sabotage activities that use religion. At the same time, we deeply implemented the class line of democratic reform, that is, relying on poor serfs and slaves, uniting middle serfs (including wealthy serfs), uniting all forces that can be united, resolutely打击rebelling and the most reactionary serf owners and their agents, to thoroughly eliminate the feudal serf system and thoroughly complete democratic reform.

Over the past year, democratic reform and reform review work has achieved great results. As of the end of November, in agricultural areas with a population of 800,000, land reform work has been carried out in areas with a population of 760,000, and land has been distributed, most of which have completed reform review work and issued land certificates. The reform review and land certificate issuance work in a small number of areas can also be completed this winter. Land reform work is currently underway in areas with a population of 20,000.

The reform review work has been carried out successively since the third quarter of this year. From the situation learned from the review, it proves that the development of the democratic reform movement in Tibet since last year is normal and healthy. Due to the conscientious implementation of the Party's various policies and the implementation of the class line of democratic reform, after the "three antis and double reductions" and land distribution, the vast majority of rural areas have basically fully mobilized the masses, destroyed the feudal serf system, the prestige of the serf owner class has been basically defeated, the political advantage of the people has been basically established, and the development of the production mutual aid movement is also normal. In a few areas, the mobilization of the masses is not sufficient, the feudal serf system has not been completely destroyed, and the prestige of the serf owner class has not been completely defeated. A small number of the most reactionary serf owners and serf owner agents who are unwilling to see the death of the feudal serf system, adopt various insidious and malicious means, buy over, rope in, threaten, and assassinate cadres and activists among the masses, spread rumors among the masses, incite ethnic relations, and carry out various sabotage activities. The sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements are also relatively rampant. The people hate them to the bone.

In the reform review, the broad masses of working people further raised their class consciousness. They were high-spirited and militant, thoroughly exposing all the conspiracies and evil deeds of the reactionary elements attempting to sabotage the democratic reform and the people's revolutionary cause, and waged a resolute struggle against them, further打击the remaining reactionary forces in Tibet and suffering another shameful defeat, thereby consolidating the achievements of the democratic reform and promoting a new upsurge in rural production. Facts have proved that the reform review work is very necessary and fully meets the wishes of the broad masses of working people to carry out the democratic reform thoroughly.

Through the democratic reform and reform review movement, the three antis movement against rebellion, feudal privileges, and feudal exploitation and oppression systems was carried out in the vast majority of monasteries and among the broad masses of monks and nuns throughout the region. The harsh facts of feudal exploitation and feudal oppression revealed from within the monasteries profoundly educated the broad masses of monks and nuns and raised their political consciousness; a democratic management system was implemented within the monasteries, the political rights and the right to freedom of religious belief of the masses of monks and nuns were guaranteed, and the religious beliefs of the broad masses of people were truly free. At the same time, the patriotism and political understanding of patriotic and law-abiding religious figures have been further improved. They warmly support the Party's policy of freedom of religious belief and are grateful to Party and the People's Government for their care and concern.

Tibet has vast pastoral areas and a large number of livestock. According to preliminary statistics, there are about 10 million head of livestock in the region. During the democratic reform in agricultural areas, the Party's policy for pastoral areas was not to divide cattle and sheep, not to classify classes, and not to struggle against herd owners; to carry out the three antis movement against rebellion, against Ula corvee, and against personal dependence; and to implement a policy of mutual benefit for both herders and herd owners. On the basis of developing animal husbandry production, appropriately and gradually improve the lives of herders. Properly arrange the production and life of the herders, protect livestock, and develop animal husbandry production, requiring that both people and livestock are safe. Over the past year, in pastoral areas with a population of 300,000, the "three antis" movement has been carried out in areas with more than two-thirds of the population, and the "two benefits" policy has been implemented, changing the feudal servitude relationship between herd owners and herdsmen into an employment relationship, and taking care of and protecting the legitimate interests of herd owners. In these areas, the class consciousness and production enthusiasm of the broad masses of herders have been unprecedentedly high, and the enthusiasm of herd owners to operate animal husbandry production has also been improved, basically achieving safety for both people and livestock.

(II)

This year, Tibet's agricultural production achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with grain output generally increasing by about 15% compared with the bumper harvest of 1959. Some counties increased by more than 15%, and individual places even saw high-yield fields with an increase of more than 50%. In Zhangda Township, Mailing County, Nyingchi Prefecture, 2,216 grams (one gram is about equal to one mu) of highland barley and wheat produced 14 grams per gram (one gram is 28 jin) due to sowing with selected seeds, applying nearly 10,000 jin of base fertilizer per gram of land, and weeding and irrigating multiple times during field management, an increase of nearly double compared with 1959. The bumper harvest in Tibet's agricultural production this year is not accidental. This is an inevitable result of the implementation of democratic reform, the abolition of the old relations of production, the establishment of new relations of production, the liberation of rural productive forces, the fact that the broad masses of farmers have become the masters of the land and the new society, and the increase in class consciousness and production enthusiasm.

In the past, under the rule of the feudal serf system in Tibet, all land and other major means of production were occupied by serf owners. The broad masses of serfs and slaves, who accounted for more than 90% of the region's population, not only had no means of production, but were also completely occupied by serf owners. They worked like cattle and horses on the land of serf owners all year round, but ate pig and dog food. More than 70% of their labor income was plundered by serf owners. "After the autumn harvest, the zanba is cut off," making it impossible to maintain life, and they often had to borrow usury from serf owners, accumulating "descendant debts" that could not be repaid for generations. In addition, serfs and slaves had to bear various corvee and numerous exorbitant taxes for serf owners. This cruel exploitation and oppression made the broad masses of serfs and slaves live in human hell and struggle on the verge of death. Of course, there would be no enthusiasm for production. The serf owners used the wealth plundered from serfs and slaves entirely to satisfy their licentious and decadent lives, and did not care about developing production at all. Therefore, for thousands of years, the tools and farming techniques of agricultural production in Tibet have been very backward. Even today, many places still use wooden plows and wooden harrows to cultivate land, turning the soil two or three inches, unable to plow out grass roots or break up soil clumps; some places even use a wooden stick to plow the land, which can only scratch the soil. Harvesting tools are also very backward. Some places do not have sickles and have long used wooden spikes to cut spikes or use fingers to pick spikes, and threshing is almost entirely done by herding a group of yaks to tread the field. In such circumstances, although farmers work hard on the land all year round, grain yields are very low.

In the three antis and double reductions movement, due to the implementation of policies such as "whoever plants harvests" "reducing rent and interest" and abolishing usury, the masses benefited by more than 1 billion jin of grain, an average benefit of more than 1,500 jin per person. In the land reform movement, due to the implementation of the peasant land ownership system, the land occupied by feudal serf owners was distributed to the peasants, so that each person received an average of three grams of land and a certain amount of draught animals and farm tools. Serfs and slaves who had no foothold for thousands of years, for the first time had their own land and became masters of the land; for the first time, they worked on their own land for their own happy life, so they rejoiced, sang and danced, and their enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high, and they eagerly demanded to develop production and change their living conditions. In response to this situation, last winter and this spring, an patriotic and abundant production movement centered on production mutual aid was launched in areas where democratic reform had been carried out. Based on the principle of "voluntary mutual benefit", more than 15,000 production mutual aid groups were organized in the vast rural areas, with more than 100,000 households joining the groups. With soaring revolutionary enthusiasm, the broad masses of farmers vigorously engaged in accumulating fertilizer, creating fertilizer, deeply plowing the land, building water conservancy, improving old farm tools, and manufacturing new farm tools, forming a vigorous mass movement for vigorously engaging in agricultural production. Party committees and people's governments at all levels promptly grasped the leadership of production and mutual aid groups, and helped farmers solve various difficulties in production, greatly encouraging the enthusiasm of the masses for production. Last winter and this spring, the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region twice issued instructions on vigorously engaging in agricultural production, calling on farmers in various places to implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production in accordance with local conditions, and put forward specific requirements for increasing production measures. People's governments at all levels issued 900,000 various large and small farm tools to farmers, including new-style walking plows and other farm tools. Under the leadership and arrangement of the People's Government, various regions organized iron and woodworking groups to repair and manufacture farm tools. For example, in Zhag'nang County in Shannan Prefecture, 34 iron and woodworking groups were organized this spring, repairing more than 70,000 old farm tools and manufacturing nearly 60,000 new farm tools. Last winter and this spring, significant achievements were made in water conservancy construction throughout the region. According to statistics from five regions including Lhasa City, a total of 10,400 canals were repaired, with a total length of more than 5,000 kilometers, and more than 1,500 reservoirs and ponds were built entirely by indigenous methods and using local materials, thereby greatly expanding the irrigated area. In some prefectures, the irrigated area has reached more than 90% of the cultivated land area. In this year's production, the broad masses of cadres went deep into the fields, participated in production, led production, worked with farmers, jointly studied and improved farming techniques, improved farm tools, and promptly solved various problems in production and mutual aid groups. Many county and district cadres also planted high-yield experimental fields, explored experience, and conducted demonstrations of advanced farming techniques. Lhasa and other regions also regularly held on-site meetings in the fields and on the threshing grounds to promptly summarize and exchange experience and promote advanced technologies. All of this is an important condition for achieving a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year. As the farmers said when summarizing this year's production experience, the bumper harvest this year is due to: first, the good leadership of the Party; second, the fact that they have been liberated and are working for themselves, so their enthusiasm for production is high; third, the mutual aid groups are organized; and fourth, the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production is implemented.

It is particularly worth mentioning that with the vigorous production movement, social customs and the mental outlook of the broad masses have undergone new changes. Due to the mass movement of accumulating and creating fertilizer, the garbage that used to pile up like mountains everywhere along the roadsides in many places has now been cleaned up, thereby promoting a mass patriotic health movement. Many places have generally established indigenous fertilizer plants. Resourceful and intelligent farmers have used animal bones, weeds, excrement, ashes, and other materials to make "Six-Combination Fertilizer," "Seven-Combination Fertilizer," and other fertilizers with good fertilizer effects. Some places have also used various poisonous weeds to make indigenous pesticides with strong insecticidal power. In order to protect the bumper harvest, the masses of farmers have changed many old habits and eliminated pests, harmful birds, and harmful animals.

In terms of animal husbandry production, in pastoral areas where the three antis movement has been carried out and the two benefits policy has been implemented, on the basis of mobilizing the masses of herders, planned and rational use of pastures was initially carried out, and measures such as seasonal rotation, timely fattening, protecting fetuses and delivering lambs, building sheds and pens, and storing feed were taken, as well as epidemic prevention work, which has received great results, so that the survival rate of young animals has greatly increased, and the number of livestock dying from diseases has been greatly reduced.

In terms of industrial production, Tibet only had some very backward handicrafts in the past, and no modern industry at all. In the past few years since the peaceful liberation, thanks to the care of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, and thanks to the support and assistance of the people of all fraternal nationalities, some small factories that were urgently needed in the life and production of the Tibetan people have been established one after another. However, because the feudal serf system at that time had not been reformed, and because the former Tibetan local government had obstructed it in every possible way, the role of these factories could not be brought into play. For example, the Lhasa Iron and Wood Factory hardly carried out production after it was built. Since last winter, the People's Government has actively supported the recovery and expansion of handicraft production that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood; and on the basis of the voluntary participation of handicraftsmen, handicraft production mutual aid groups have been established in the cities; the People's Government has helped them solve the raw materials and product sales problems, organized and led them to improve production technology, improve product quality, and trial-produce new products, playing a good role in meeting the production and living needs of the masses. At the same time, some small-scale industries serving agricultural and animal husbandry production, such as iron and woodworking farm tool manufacturing plants and serum factories, have been built in accordance with the principles of necessity and feasibility. The first modern hydropower station, with a power generation capacity of 7,500 kilowatts, was completed this spring. The steel plant under construction took three months to build a blast furnace, and the first furnace of molten iron flowed out on October 1. Now Tibet has new industries such as steel, hydropower, automobile repair and assembly, farm tool manufacturing, and serum veterinary medicine.

(III)

Over the past year, we have actively carried out the work of political power construction and training ethnic minority cadres. Tibet's original administrative divisions were formed under the rule of the three major lords to meet the interests of the three major lords, which was extremely unreasonable. In order to facilitate the people's democratic power to serve the interests of the people, with the approval of the State Council, we appropriately adjusted the original administrative divisions this year while establishing people's democratic power organs at all levels. The entire region is divided into seven prefectures, one city, and seventy-two counties. Now the administrative organs at the prefectural and county levels have been basically established, and most of the district and township political power have also been established. Although the political power organs in some places are not perfect enough, they truly represent the interests of the people, serve the Tibetan people, and are the political power of the broad masses of Tibetan people themselves.

With gradual establishment of people's governments at all levels, people's democratic dictatorship has been further strengthened and consolidated. Over the past year, while leading and organizing the masses, people's governments at all levels have continued to carry out democratic reform and vigorously engage in agricultural and animal husbandry production, and in conjunction with the central work, based on the policy of "combining leniency with suppression", further打击the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries and various bad elements, defended the victorious achievements of democratic reform, and protected the safety of the masses' production and life and property.

The work of training cadres has made great progress since this year. More than 3,000 children of working people who were sent to Xianyang Tibet Public School in 1957 have improved in terms of political awareness, policy, and cultural level after more than two years of study. Most of them returned to Tibet one after another last year and this year to participate in the democratic reform work. After practical training in the class struggle of democratic reform, the class awareness and policy level of these cadres have been significantly improved, and they have accumulated work experience and improved their work ability. They work actively, have a firm position, closely contact the masses, and serve the masses wholeheartedly. They have now been assigned to work in various work posts throughout the region. Some have served as leaders in county and district government agencies. At the same time, since last year, a large number of activists have emerged in this sharp class struggle of democratic reform. They stood at the forefront of the struggle in reform and production, led the masses, and completed various tasks together with the masses, and were deeply supported by the masses. Among them, outstanding elements with high awareness and resolute struggle have been trained and improved through short-term training and other methods, and have served as leading positions in township political power and agricultural associations at all levels. Now the newly born revolutionary cadre team in Tibet is growing rapidly. These cadres are the valuable property of the Tibetan people. They have not only played an important role in the democratic reform, but will certainly play a greater role in the great cause of building a democratic and socialist new Tibet.

The development of various tasks in Tibet requires the support of the people of all fraternal nationalities led by the Han nationality, and a considerable number of Han cadres and cadres of other fraternal nationalities must work in Tibet. In addition to the cadres who have successively entered Tibet in the past few years, since last year, the Central Committee has transferred a group of backbone cadres above the district level from various fraternal provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country to work in Tibet. The vast majority of Han cadres and cadres of various fraternal nationalities working in Tibet have demonstrated the noble qualities of hard work, wholeheartedly serving the Tibetan people, and being loyal to the liberation cause of the Tibetan people in their work. After more than a year of practical work, these cadres have basically understood the situation in Tibet, accumulated experience in working in Tibet, and established close feelings with the Tibetan people. They have played an important role in the revolutionary cause of the Tibetan people and will continue to play an important role. The Tibetan people will never forget the great support and help given to them by the people of all fraternal nationalities led by the Han eldest brother. Vigorously carrying out the study of Tibetan and Chinese languages among cadres is an important task in the work of training cadres in Tibet. In the work of the past two years, many Han cadres and cadres of other nationalities have actively studied the Tibetan language, and some have learned general daily expressions. At the same time, many Tibetan cadres are also actively learning Chinese. Over the past year, Party committees and people's governments at all levels have also attached importance to the study of Tibetan and Chinese languages by cadres, which has achieved certain results. In the future, we must better strengthen the planning of this work, take effective measures, organize regular Tibetan and Chinese language learning among cadres, so that most Han cadres can master the Tibetan language tools so that they can play a greater role in their work; so that most Tibetan cadres can learn Chinese so that they can better learn various knowledge and improve more quickly. At the same time, this is of great significance for Tibetan and Han cadres to better help each other in their work and do their work together.

Culture, Education, Health and Other Aspects: After democratic reform, the broad masses of people, having achieved liberation politically and economically, urgently demanded cultural liberation. Adapting to this situation, since last year, a large number of people-run primary schools have appeared in the vast rural areas. Since this year, people-run primary schools have had new and further development. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 1,500 people-run and people-run with government assistance primary schools throughout the region, with more than 30,000 students. In developing school education, we have implemented the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and education combined with productive labor", and according to the current actual situation, we have adopted the principle of "people-run as the mainstay, government-run as a supplement", and strengthened the leadership, consolidation and improvement of a large number of people-run primary schools. After a large number of people-run primary schools developed rapidly, teachers were extremely scarce. Over the past year, various places have reformed and used a number of old private school teachers and lamas to serve as teachers in people-run primary schools. In order to gradually help the masses solve the difficulty of lacking teachers, the Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region has opened teacher training classes in Lhasa. The first group of 102 people graduated in September and were assigned to various places to serve as primary school teachers. In terms of teaching materials, the nationally used primary school textbooks have been basically translated into Tibetan and are being printed and distributed to various places for use. At the same time, temporary language and arithmetic teaching materials have also been compiled and printed.

Judging from the actual situation in Tibet, adopting the principle of people-run as the mainstay and people-run with government assistance to develop primary school education is a good way to mobilize the masses to run education for all. In the future, we plan to further strengthen the leadership of people-run primary schools on a regular basis, and help solve the difficulties that the masses cannot solve in running schools as conditions permit, so that people-run primary schools will continuously improve in quality and gradually become perfect.

There are currently 13 government-run primary schools in Tibet, with more than 3,000 students. These primary schools are relatively perfect. Currently, on the basis of further improving the quality of teaching, through teaching practice, we are studying how to develop education undertakings in Tibet in a more, faster, better, and more economical way according to the actual situation in Tibet, in order to guide the development of education undertakings in the entire region in a more, faster, and better way.

In terms of secondary education, there is one junior high school in Lhasa, which graduated its first batch of 40 students this year. Middle school classes have been established in Shigatse, Qamdo, Gyantse and other places, with a total of more than 400 students.

In terms of cultural and artistic undertakings, with the care of the Central Committee and the support of fraternal provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, Tibet currently has 70 professional film projection teams, with about 200 projectionists; there are also some professional song and dance troupes and theater troupes. These film teams and theater troupes often go deep into rural and pastoral areas for touring performances. They have achieved good results in coordinating with the central work, publicizing the Party's policies to the broad masses, carrying out patriotism and socialist education, as well as education on ethnic unity. The broad masses of people have also organized many amateur Tibetan opera troupes, dance troupes, and drama troupes themselves. They write, direct, and perform and watch themselves, exposing and accusing the crimes of the feudal serf system and the three major lords, praising the great Communist Party of China, praising the great leader Chairman Mao, and singing happily about their new life. Now in the vast rural areas and cities of Tibet, no longer hear the moans of suffering, but everywhere is a new atmosphere of singing and dancing, and rejoicing.

Medical and health undertakings have had new development this year. Currently, there are 118 medical institutions of various sizes throughout the region. Most counties have established health centers, and people's hospitals have been established in each prefecture. Over the past year, mobile medical services have been universally strengthened, effectively coordinating with democratic reform, autumn harvest, reform review and other work. Patients in many remote and isolated areas can also receive medical treatment, which is deeply welcomed by the masses. At the same time, health and epidemic prevention work has been carried out. Various places have combined with production and fertilizer accumulation to carry out mass patriotic health movements, which have achieved significant good results. Over the past year, a group of Tibetan health cadres has also been trained. More than 100 Tibetan primary health cadres trained in Shannan and Gyantse prefectures have taken up their work posts; more than 200 primary health workers in Lhasa and other places are in training. According to incomplete statistics, more than 500 non-full-time health workers and midwives have also been trained throughout the region. In addition, people's hospitals in various places have also conducted investigations and studies on plateau diseases.

Over the past year, financial, trade, transportation and other aspects of work have also had new development.

The above-mentioned achievements have been obtained due to the wise and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. The various policies on democratic reform and production in Tibet stipulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are completely in line with the actual situation in Tibet and are completely correct. Over the past year, the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China and Party committees at all levels, the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region and people's governments at all levels have correctly implemented the various guidelines and policies stipulated by the Central Committee, so that various tasks in Tibet have continued to develop forward more, faster, better, and more economically on the basis of the great victory of suppressing the rebellion and reform in 1959, and have achieved new and great victories. At the same time, over the past year, the people of all fraternal nationalities, all fraternal provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country have given great support and assistance to the Tibetan people in terms of manpower and material resources. Therefore, the achievements made in various tasks in Tibet over the past year are a victory of the unprecedented great unity of the people of all fraternal nationalities in our country under the brilliant illumination of the Chinese Communist Party's ethnic policy.

Through the work of the past year, we have further deeply realized that the leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of all our work. Of all the thousands of things, the leadership of the Party is the first. In our work, as long as we closely rely on the leadership of the Party, conscientiously implement the Party's guidelines and policies and various instructions, we can have a clear direction and be invincible. Departing from the leadership of the Party and violating the guidelines and policies stipulated by the Party, our work will be defeated. Mao Zedong Thought is the red flag that guides us to forever move towards victory. Chairman Mao often taught us that no reactionary faction will automatically withdraw from the stage of history, they always want to make trouble; make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are completely dead. We must not have any unrealistic illusions about the reactionaries, we must mobilize the masses and resolutely fight them until they are completely overthrown. Numerous facts have proved that Chairman Mao's teaching is completely correct and wise. The reactionary faction in Tibet suffered a fundamental failure last year, but they will make trouble whenever they have the opportunity. We must always be vigilant against their conspiracies and resolutely fight them until they completely fall down and are no longer able to make trouble. Chairman Mao also taught us that all revolutionary work and revolutionary movements are movements of self-liberation by the broad masses of people, and we must adopt the method of the mass line and fully mobilize the masses to carry them out. The practice of Tibet's work over the past year has proved that wherever the masses are fully mobilized, the consciousness of the masses is raised, the reform, production, and various tasks are turned into the conscious actions of the masses, and the masses are relied on in the work to form a broad mass movement, the counter-revolutionary elements there have no foothold, the democratic reform there is carried out thoroughly, the production is carried out very well, and all the work seems to be vigorous and full of vitality. On the contrary, everything seems cold and desolate, without any vitality. In the future, we must conscientiously organize all cadres to study Chairman Mao's works, arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and in practical work, we must more conscientiously and better implement the instructions of the Party and Chairman Mao.

In the work of the past year, we have more deeply realized that strengthening the unity of the people of all fraternal nationalities in the motherland and the mutual support and assistance between the people of all nationalities is an important guarantee for the common development, common prosperity, and common progress of the people of all nationalities in our country. It is unimaginable that the Tibetan people would be able to completely get rid of poverty and backwardness and embark on the road of prosperity and happiness without the mutual support and assistance of the people of all fraternal nationalities. The Tibetan people will always cherish the unity of the motherland and the unity of nationalities as they cherish their own lives, and will constantly strive to strengthen and consolidate this unity.

The practice of the past year has further proved that the hardworking and brave Tibetan people, like the people of all fraternal nationalities in the motherland, have abundant and endless wisdom. The Tibetan people, who have been liberated through democratic reform, have demonstrated amazing enthusiasm and creative talent in the production and construction of the past year. Now the Tibetan people are fighting to build a democratic and socialist new Tibet.

In short, the current situation in Tibet is excellent. In the vast rural areas and cities, there is a flourishing scene of labor production everywhere. This is the main stream of Tibet's work. But on the other hand, there are still many shortcomings in our work due to lack of experience. The main problem is that the masses in a few places have not been mobilized sufficiently, and the work in the vast pastoral areas has not yet explored a set of experiences suitable for the characteristics of the pastoral areas, such as the large area, sparse population, scattered residential areas, and high mobility. At the same time, there are still many problems, such as the fact that the people's government organs at all levels need to be further enriched and the various systems need to be gradually established and improved, the people's democratic dictatorship needs to be continuously strengthened and consolidated, and transportation conditions need to be greatly improved. All these problems need to be further resolved.

According to the current actual situation in Tibet, our main tasks in the next period are to thoroughly complete democratic reform, further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, carry out the people's democratic revolution thoroughly, and vigorously develop agricultural and animal husbandry production. In carrying out these tasks, we will also encounter new difficulties. However, under the wise and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the brilliant illumination of the three red flags of the General Line, the Great leap Forward and the People's commune , with the support and assistance of the people of all fraternal nationalities across the country, we have the confidence and determination to continue to carry forward the fine style of hard struggle, guard against arrogance and rashness, closely contact the masses, unite the people of all strata, raise political vigilance, boost greater revolutionary enthusiasm, conscientiously implement the Party's various guidelines and policies, actively overcome all difficulties, constantly overcome the shortcomings in our work, and strive to do a good job in order to build a democratic and socialist new Tibet.

The above is for deliberation, and please criticize and correct any inappropriate points. (Attached picture)

    一年来西藏工作的报告
    1960年12月14日在第二届全国人民代表大会常务委员会第三十三次会议扩大会议上
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞委员长、各位委员：
    现在我代表西藏自治区筹备委员会，向人大常委会汇报一下1960年西藏各项工作进展的主要情况。
    1960年是我国社会主义建设持续跃进的第三年。一年来，全国各兄弟民族人民，在党中央和毛主席英明正确的领导下，高举着总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗，发愤图强，自力更生，以更大的革命干劲，在社会主义建设各个战线上，大闹技术革命和技术革新，使我国社会主义建设实现了持续的高速度发展，进入了一个新的发展阶段。一年来，西藏地区各项工作，同全国各地一样，在去年各项工作获得伟大成绩的基础上，实现了持续的跃进。
    今年4月间，西藏自治区筹备委员会举行了第四次委员会议扩大会议，检查总结了1959年平息叛乱、民主改革等各方面的工作，讨论制定了1960年的工作任务。根据中央的指示和西藏的实际情况，1960年西藏地区的工作任务是：在继续充分发动群众，完成民主改革，巩固人民民主专政，大力发展农业生产的同时，认真做好建立人民民主政权，培养民族干部，发展财经贸易、交通运输和文教卫生等各项建设工作。一年来，在党中央和毛主席的英明正确的领导下，中共西藏工委和西藏自治区筹备委员会和各级党委、各级人民政府，认真贯彻执行了党的各项方针政策；各级干部和各阶层人民团结一致，发扬了艰苦奋斗的精神，以冲天的革命干劲，积极努力地进行了各项工作，胜利地完成了上述工作任务，取得了新的更大的成绩。
    （一）
    在民主改革方面，1960年的具体任务是：在1959年尚未进行民主改革的农业地区，继续开展民主改革运动，有计划、有步骤地完成土地改革工作。在已经进行了土地改革的地区，结合大搞农业生产，采取“生产复查两不误”的原则，进行民主改革的复查工作，以进一步充分发动群众，处理改革中的遗留问题，巩固民主改革的成果，并为今后发展生产建设和逐步进行社会主义改造创造必要的良好条件。改革复查的方针是边查边改，边改边建。改革复查的内容是：1．查土地分配是否有不够合理的地方；2．查封建农奴制度是否已被彻底摧垮；3．查群众优势是否完全树立；4．查生产互助运动是否正常发展；5．查某些干部的工作作风是否有不够深入和立场是否有不够坚定的地方；6．查寺庙的“三反三算”是否彻底；7．查赎买政策贯彻执行情况。
    在继续进行民主改革和进行改革复查中，继续贯彻了中央规定的西藏民主改革的各项方针政策。即在充分发动群众的同时，认真做好上层统战工作，保护和帮助爱国进步的上层人士过好民主改革关；对叛乱和没有叛乱的农奴主和农奴主代理人实行区别对待；在寺庙中彻底废除寺庙的封建特权、封建剥削和封建压迫制度，认真执行党的宗教信仰自由政策，以及保护爱国守法的佛教徒，保护正当的宗教活动，保护僧尼群众的政治权利和信教自由的权利；保护寺庙的文物古迹；坚决打击利用宗教进行的反革命活动和一切破坏活动。同时，深入贯彻了民主改革的阶级路线，即依靠贫苦农奴和奴隶，团结中等农奴（包括富裕农奴），团结一切可以团结的力量，坚决打击叛乱的和最反动的农奴主及其代理人，以彻底消灭封建农奴制度，彻底完成民主改革。
    一年来民主改革和改革复查工作取得了很大的成绩。截至11月底，在八十万人口的农业地区，已有七十六万人口的地区进行了土地改革工作，分配了土地，其中大部分已完成了改革复查工作，并发了土地证。少部分地区的改革复查和发土地证工作在今冬亦可全部完成。有两万人口的地区目前正在进行土地改革工作。
    改革复查工作，是从今年第三季度以来先后开展的。从复查中了解的情况来看，证明去年以来西藏民主改革运动的发展是正常的、健康的。由于认真执行了党的各项政策，贯彻了民主改革的阶级路线，经过“三反双减”和土地分配的农村绝大部分地区，基本上充分发动了群众，摧毁了封建农奴制度，农奴主阶级的威风已基本上被打垮，人民群众的政治优势已基本树立起来，生产互助运动发展也是正常的。在少数地区，群众发动的还不够充分，封建农奴制度还没有彻底摧毁，农奴主阶级的威风还没有彻底打垮。人民群众的政治优势还没有树立起来。少数不甘心于封建农奴制度死亡的最反动的农奴主和农奴主代理人，采取各种阴险毒恶的手段，收买拉拢、威胁暗害干部和群众中的积极分子，在群众中散布谣言，挑拨民族关系，进行各种破坏活动。反革命分子的破坏活动也比较猖狂。人民群众对他们恨之入骨。
    在改革复查中，广大劳动群众进一步提高了阶级觉悟，他们意气风发，斗志昂扬，彻底揭发了一切反动分子企图破坏民主改革，破坏人民革命事业的阴谋诡计和罪恶行为，并与之进行了坚决的斗争，使西藏残余反动势力受到进一步打击，再一次遭到可耻失败，从而巩固了民主改革的成果，推动了农村新的生产高潮。事实证明，改革复查工作是十分必要的，是完全符合广大劳动人民要求把民主改革进行彻底的愿望的。
    经过民主改革和改革复查运动，全区绝大多数寺庙和广大僧尼中进行了反叛乱、反封建特权、反封建剥削压迫制度的三反运动。从寺庙内部揭发出来的苛重的封建剥削和封建压迫事实，深刻地教育了广大僧尼，提高了他们的政治觉悟；寺庙内部实行了民主管理制度，僧尼群众的政治权利和信教自由的权利得到保障，广大人民的宗教信仰得到了真正的自由。同时，爱国守法的宗教界人士的爱国主义思想和政治认识也有了进一步提高，他们热烈拥护党的宗教信仰自由政策，感激党和人民政府对他们的关怀和照顾。
    西藏有广大的牧区和大量的牲畜。据初步统计，全区共有牲畜约一千万头。在农区民主改革期间，党对于牧区的政策是不分牛羊，不划阶级，不斗争牧主；开展反对叛乱、反对乌拉差役、反对人身依附的三反运动；实行牧工牧主两利政策。在发展牧业生产的基础上，适当地逐步地改善牧民生活。妥善安排牧民群众的生产和生活，保护牲畜，发展牧业生产，要求做到人畜两安。一年来，在三十万人口的牧区，有三分之二以上人口的地区开展了“三反”运动，实行了“两利”政策，把牧主和牧奴之间的封建奴役关系改变为雇工关系，并照顾和保护了牧主的合法利益。在这些地区，广大牧民群众的阶级觉悟和生产积极性空前高涨，牧主经营牧业生产的积极性亦有所提高，基本上达到了人畜两安。
    （二）
    今年西藏的农业生产取得了空前的大丰收，粮食产量比丰收的1959年一般的增产15％左右。有些县增产15％以上，个别地方还出现了增产50％以上的高额丰产田。林芝专区米林县章达乡的二千二百一十六克（一克约等于一市亩）青稞、小麦，由于用穗选良种播种，每克地施底肥近万斤，田间管理期间多次拔草和灌水，平均每克产青稞、小麦十四克（一克二十八市斤），比1959年增产近一倍。今年西藏农业生产取得大丰收，不是偶然的。这是实行民主改革，废除了旧的生产关系，建立了新的生产关系，解放了农村生产力以后，广大农民成了土地和新社会的主人，提高了阶级觉悟和生产积极性的必然结果。
    西藏过去在封建农奴制度统治下，全部土地和其他主要生产资料都被农奴主霸占，占全区人口90％以上的广大农奴和奴隶，不仅没有生产资料，连人身也完全被农奴主所占有。他们常年在农奴主的土地上作的是牛马活，吃的却是猪狗食，劳动收获的70％以上都被农奴主掠夺了去，“打完秋场，断了粘粑”，无法维持生活，又不得不经常向农奴主借高利贷，积累成了世世代代无法还清的“子孙债”。此外，农奴和奴隶还要为农奴主负担各种差役和名目繁多的苛捐杂税。这种残酷的剥削、压榨，使广大农奴和奴隶在人间地狱中生活，在死亡线上挣扎，当然不会有生产积极性。农奴主们把从农奴和奴隶那里掠夺去的财富，完全用于满足他们荒淫糜烂的生活上，根本不关心发展生产。所以千百年来西藏农业生产的工具和耕作技术都十分落后，至今有不少地方还使用木犁、木耙耕地，翻土两三寸，草根犁不掉，土块耙不碎；有的地方还用一根木棒犁地，只能划破土皮。有的地方甚至还实行“刀耕火种”。收割工具也很落后，有些地方没有镰刀，长期使用木头切穗或用手指摘穗，打场几乎全是哄一群牦牛踩场。在这样的情况下，农民们尽管终年不息地在土地上进行沉重的劳动，但是粮食产量很低。
    在三反双减运动中，由于实行“谁种谁收”“减租减息”和废除高利贷等政策，群众得益约折合粮食十亿多斤，每人平均得益一千五百多斤。在土地改革运动中，由于实行农民的土地所有制，把封建农奴主占有的土地分配给农民，使每人平均分得了三克土地和一定数量的耕畜、农具。千百年来无立足之地的农奴和奴隶，第一次有了自己的土地，成了土地的主人；第一次在自己的土地上为自己的幸福生活而劳动，所以他们欢天喜地，载歌载舞，生产积极性空前高涨，迫切要求发展生产，改变自己的生活境况。适应此一形势，去年冬季和今年春季在已经进行了民主改革的地区掀起了以生产互助为中心的爱国丰产运动。根据“自愿互利”的原则，在广大农村中组织了一万五千多个生产互助组，入组农户达到十万户以上。广大农民在生产中以冲天的革命干劲，大搞积肥、造肥，深翻土地，修建水利，改良旧农具，制造新农具，形成了轰轰烈烈的大搞农业生产的群众运动。各级党委和人民政府及时抓紧了对生产和互助组的领导，并帮助农民解决生产中的各项困难，大大地鼓舞了群众的生产热情。去年冬季和今年春季，中共西藏工委和西藏自治区筹委会曾两次发出关于大搞农业生产的指示，号召各地农民因地制宜，贯彻农业生产“八字宪法”，提出了增产措施的具体要求。各级人民政府向农民发放各种大小农具九十万件，其中包括有新式步犁等农具。在人民政府领导和安排下，各地区组织了修理和制造农具的铁木工小组，比如山南专区的札囊县，在今年春季组织了三十四个铁木工小组，修补旧农具七万余件，制造新农具将近六万件。去年冬季和今年春季，全区在兴修水利方面，取得了显著的成绩，据拉萨市等五个地区统计，共修水渠一万零四百条，全长达五千多公里，并完全采用土法上马，就地取材，兴建了一千五百多个水库和水塘，从而大大地扩大了灌溉面积。有些专区的灌溉面积，已达到耕地面积的90％以上。在今年的生产中，广大干部深入到田间，参加生产，领导生产，同农民一起劳动，共同研究改进耕作技术，改良农具，及时解决生产和互助组中的各种问题，有不少县区干部还种了丰产试验田，摸索经验，进行先进耕作技术示范。拉萨等地区还经常在田头、场边召开现场会议，及时总结交流经验，推广先进技术。这一切都是今年取得农业生产丰收的重要条件。正如农民们在总结今年的生产经验时说的，今年能丰收，一是党领导的好；二是得到翻身解放，为自己劳动，生产劲头大；三是组织了互助组；四是贯彻了农业生产“八字宪法”。
    值得特别提出的是随着大搞生产运动，社会风尚和广大群众的精神面貌有了新的改变。由于开展了群众性的积肥造肥运动，过去在许多地方村边路旁到处堆积如山的垃圾，现在被清除得干干净净，从而推动了群众性的爱国卫生运动。许多地方普遍建立了土化肥厂，智慧丰富的农民，用兽骨、杂草、屎便、草木灰等制成了肥效良好的“六合肥”“七合肥”等肥料。有的地方还用各种毒草制成了杀虫力很强的土农药。为了保丰收，农民群众改变了许多旧的习惯，大除害虫、害鸟、害兽。
    在牧业生产方面，在已进行了三反运动和实行了两利政策的牧业区，在发动牧民群众的基础上，初步进行了有计划的合理使用牧场，采取四季轮放，及时抓膘，保胎接羔，修筑棚圈，储藏饲料等措施，以及开展了防疫工作，已收到了很大的效果，使幼畜成活率大有增加，因病害死亡的牲畜大大减少。
    在工业生产方面，西藏过去仅有一些很落后的手工业，没有任何现代工业。和平解放后几年来，由于中央人民政府和毛主席的关怀，由于各兄弟民族人民的支援帮助，曾先后建立了一些在西藏人民的生活、生产上迫切需要的小型工厂。但由于当时封建农奴制度没有改革，加之原西藏地方政府百般阻挠，这些工厂的作用得不到发挥，如拉萨的铁木工厂建成以后，几乎没有进行生产。去年冬季以来，人民政府积极扶持有利于国计民生的手工业恢复和扩大生产；并在手工业者自愿的基础上，在城市中建立了手工业生产互助组；人民政府帮助他们解决原料及产品销路，组织领导他们改进生产技术，提高产品质量，试制新产品，在满足群众生产、生活需要上起了良好的作用。在此同时，根据必需和可能的原则，建设了一些小型的为农、牧业生产服务的工业，如铁木工农具制造厂、血清厂等。今年春季建成了第一座现代化水电站，发电能力为七千五百瓩。正在建设中的钢铁厂，用了三个月的时间，建成了一座高炉，并于10月1日流出了第一炉铁水。现在西藏已有了钢铁、水电、汽车修配、农具制造、血清兽药等新的工业。
    （三）
    一年来，我们积极进行了政权建设和培养民族干部的工作。西藏原有的行政区划是在三大领主统治下，适应三大领主的利益而形成的，极不合理。为了便于人民民主政权为人民利益服务，经请示国务院批准，我们在今年建立各级人民民主政权机构的同时，对原有的行政区划进行了适当调整。全区共划为七个专区，一个市，七十二个县。现在专区和县两级的行政机构已基本建立，大部分区、乡政权也已建立起来。尽管有些地方的政权机构还不十分完善，但是它是真正代表人民利益、为西藏人民服务的、西藏广大人民自己的政权。
    随着各级人民政权的逐步建立，人民民主专政有了进一步的加强和巩固。一年来，各级人民政府在领导和组织群众，继续进行民主改革和大搞农牧业生产的同时，结合中心工作，本着“宽大与镇压相结合”的方针，进一步打击了反革命和各种坏分子的破坏活动，保卫了民主改革的胜利成果，保卫了群众的生产和生命财产的安全。
    培养干部的工作，今年以来有很大的进展。1957年送到咸阳西藏公学学习的三千余名劳动人民子弟，经过两年多的学习，在政治觉悟、政策和文化水平方面均有提高，其中大部分在去年和今年先后回到西藏，参加了民主改革工作。这批干部经过民主改革阶级斗争的实际锻炼，阶级觉悟和政策水平显著提高，并积累了工作经验，提高了工作能力。他们工作积极，立场坚定，密切联系群众，全心全意为群众服务。现已分配到全区各地的各个工作岗位上去工作。有的已担任了县、区政府机关的领导工作。同时，去年以来，在民主改革这场尖锐的阶级斗争中，涌现出了大批积极分子。他们在改革中、生产中站在斗争的前列，带领群众，同群众一道完成了各项工作，深得群众拥护。其中觉悟高、斗争坚决的优秀分子，经过短期训练等方式培养提高之后，担任了乡政权和各级农会的领导职务。现在西藏藏族中新生的革命干部队伍，正在迅速成长。这些干部是西藏人民的宝贵财产。他们不仅在民主改革中起了重要作用，在建设民主和社会主义新西藏的伟大事业中，必将发挥更大的作用。
    西藏各项工作的发展，需要汉族为首的各兄弟民族人民的支援，必须有相当数量的汉族干部和其他兄弟民族干部在西藏工作。除过去几年来陆续进藏工作的干部外，去年以来中央从全国各兄弟省、市、自治区抽调了一批区以上骨干干部到西藏工作。在藏工作的绝大多数汉族干部和各兄弟民族干部，在工作中表现了吃苦耐劳，全心全意为藏族人民服务，对西藏人民的解放事业忠心耿耿的高贵品质。这些干部经过一年多实际工作，已基本了解了西藏的情况，积累了在西藏工作的经验，同藏族人民建立了亲密的感情。在西藏人民的革命事业中已经起了并且必将不断起到重要的作用。西藏人民永远忘记不了以汉族老大哥为首的各兄弟民族人民给予自己的大力支援和帮助。在干部中大力进行藏、汉语文学习，这是西藏培养干部工作中的一项重要任务。在近两年的工作中，许多汉族干部和其他民族干部，都积极学习藏语文，有部分人已学会了一般的日常用语。同时许多藏族干部也积极地学习汉文汉语。一年来，各级党委和人民政府也重视了干部的藏、汉语文学习，收到一定成效。今后我们必须更好地加强这方面工作的计划性，采取有效措施，在干部中组织经常性的藏、汉语文学习，使汉族干部大多数掌握藏语文工具，以便在工作中发挥更大的作用；使藏族干部大多数学会汉语文，以便他们更好地学习各种知识，更快地提高。同时，这对于藏、汉族干部在工作中更好地互相帮助和共同做好工作是有重大意义的。
    （四）
    文教卫生及其他方面：经过民主改革，广大人民群众在政治上、经济上获得翻身解放后，迫切要求文化翻身，适应此一形势，从去年以来，在广大农村中就出现了大批民办小学。今年以来，民办小学又有了新的进一步发展。据不完全统计，全区民办和民办公助的小学有一千五百多所，学生三万余人。在发展学校教育方面，我们贯彻了党的“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针，并根据目前的实际情况，采取“民办为主，公办为辅”的原则，加强了对大批民办小学的领导和巩固提高工作。在大批民办小学迅速发展起来之后，教师极为缺乏。一年来，各地改造、使用了一批旧的私塾教师和喇嘛等担任民办小学的教师。为了逐步帮助群众解决缺少教师的困难，自治区筹委会在拉萨开办了师资训练班，第一批一百零二人已于9月份毕业，分配到各地担任小学教师。在教材方面，全国通用的小学课本已基本上译成藏文，正在印发各地使用，同时还编印了临时性的语文和算术教材。
    从西藏的实际情况来看，采取民办为主、民办公助的原则，发展小学教育，是发动群众全民办教育的一个好办法。今后我们拟进一步经常加强对民办小学的领导，视条件可能帮助解决群众在办学中无力解决的困难问题，使民办小学不断提高质量，逐步趋于完善。
    西藏现有公办小学十三所，学生三千多人。这些小学是比较完善的。目前在进一步提高教学质量的基础上，通过教学实践，研究如何根据西藏实际情况，多、快、好、省地发展教育事业的经验，以指导全区教育事业更多更快更好地发展。
    在中等教育方面，拉萨有初级中学一所，今年毕业了第一批学生四十人。日喀则、昌都、江孜等地均已成立了中学班，共有学生四百余名。
    文化艺术事业方面，在中央的关怀和各兄弟省、市、自治区的支援下，西藏现有七十个专业电影放映队，放映人员二百人左右；还有些专业歌舞团和剧团。这些电影队和剧团，经常深入到农村、牧区巡回演出。在配合中心工作，向广大群众宣传党的政策，进行爱国主义和社会主义教育，以及民族团结的教育方面，收到很好的效果。广大群众还自己组织了许多业余藏戏队、舞蹈队、话剧队，他们自编、自演、自看，揭发控诉封建农奴制度和三大领主的罪恶，歌颂伟大的中国共产党，歌颂伟大领袖毛主席，欢唱自己的新生。现在西藏广大的农村和城市，再也听不到苦难的呻吟，到处是一片歌声洋溢，喜地欢天的新气象。
    医疗卫生事业在今年有了新的发展，目前全区已有大小医疗机构一百一十八个。大部分县建立了卫生院，各专区都建立了人民医院。一年来普遍加强了巡回医疗，有力地配合了民主改革、秋收、改革复查等工作。使不少边远偏僻地区的病人也能得到医药治疗，深受群众欢迎。同时还开展了卫生防疫工作，各地结合生产积肥，开展了群众性的爱国卫生运动，收到显著的良好效果。一年来还培养了一批藏族卫生干部。山南、江孜两个专区培养的一百多名藏族初级卫生干部已走上了工作岗位；拉萨等地的二百多名初级卫生人员正在训练中。据不完全统计，全区还培养了不脱产的保健员和接生员五百余人。此外，各地人民医院还对高原疾病进行了调查和研究。
    一年来财经贸易、交通运输等各方面的工作也均有新的发展。
    上述成绩的取得，是由于党中央和毛主席的英明正确领导而得来的。党中央和毛主席所规定的对西藏民主改革和生产的各项政策，完全符合西藏实际情况，是完全正确的。一年来，中共西藏工委和各级党委，西藏自治区筹备委员会和各级人民政府，正确地贯彻执行了中央规定的各项方针和政策，使西藏各项工作在1959年平叛、改革取得伟大胜利的基础上，多快好省地继续向前发展，取得了新的巨大胜利。同时一年来全国各兄弟民族人民，各兄弟省、市、自治区，从人力、物力各个方面，给了西藏人民巨大的支援和帮助。所以一年来西藏各项工作中取得的成绩，是在中国共产党民族政策光辉照耀下，我国各兄弟民族人民空前大团结的胜利。
    通过一年来的工作，我们进一步深刻地体会到党的领导是我们一切工作取得胜利的根本保证。千条万条，党的领导是第一条。在工作中只要紧紧依靠党的领导，认真贯彻执行党的方针政策和各项指示，就能够方向明确，无往不胜。脱离了党的领导，违背党所规定的方针和政策，工作就要遭到失败。毛泽东思想是引导我们永远走向胜利的红旗。毛主席经常教导我们，任何反动派都不会自动退出历史舞台，他们总是要捣乱的；捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，一直到他们完全死亡。对于反动派不能抱任何不切实际的幻想，必须发动群众，坚决地向他们进行斗争，一直到把他们彻底打倒。无数事实证明毛主席的这个教导是完全正确的，英明的。西藏反动派在去年遭到根本性的失败，但他们稍有机会就要捣乱，我们一定要时刻警惕他们的阴谋，坚决同他们进行斗争，一直到他们完全倒下去，再也无力捣乱。毛主席还教导我们，一切革命工作、革命运动都是广大群众自我解放的运动，必须采取群众路线的方法，充分发动群众去进行。一年来，西藏工作的实践证明，凡是充分发动群众，提高群众觉悟，把改革、生产以及各项工作变成群众的自觉行动，并在工作中依靠群众，形成广大群众运动的地方，那里的反革命分子就没有立足之地，那里的民主改革就搞得彻底，生产就搞得很好，一切工作都显得轰轰烈烈，生气勃勃。反之，则一切显得冷冷清清，毫无生气。今后我们必须在全体干部中认真组织学习毛主席的著作，用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，并在实际工作中切切实实地更好地贯彻执行党和毛主席的指示。
    在一年来的工作中，我们更深刻地体会到加强祖国各兄弟民族人民的团结，各民族人民之间互相支援帮助，是我国各民族人民共同发展、共同繁荣、共同进步的重要保证。西藏人民要彻底摆脱贫苦落后的状况，走上繁荣幸福的道路，没有各兄弟民族人民的互相支援和帮助，是不可想像的。西藏人民将永远像保护自己的生命一样，维护祖国的统一和民族团结，并不断地努力加强和巩固这种团结。
    一年来的实践进一步证明，勤劳勇敢的西藏人民，同祖国各兄弟民族人民一样，有着丰富的无穷无尽的聪明智慧。经过民主改革获得翻身解放了的西藏人民，在一年来生产建设中，表现了惊人的积极性和创造才能。现在西藏人民正在为建设民主和社会主义的新西藏而奋斗。
    总之，目前西藏的形势是大好的。在广大农村中和城市中，到处呈现着劳动生产欣欣向荣的景象。这是西藏工作的主流。但是另一方面，我们的工作中由于缺乏经验，还有不少缺点。主要是在少数地方群众发动得还不够充分，广大牧区工作还没有摸索出一套适合牧区地大人少、群众居住分散而且游动性很大等特点的经验等。同时，还有许多问题，如各级人民政权机构还有待进一步充实并逐步建立和健全各项制度，人民民主专政还需要继续加强和巩固，交通运输条件还需大力改善等等问题，都需要我们进一步加以解决。
    根据目前西藏的实际情况，我们在今后一个时期的主要任务是彻底完成民主改革，进一步巩固人民民主专政，把人民民主革命进行彻底，并大力发展农业和牧业生产。在进行这些工作中，我们还将会遇到新的困难。但是在党中央和毛主席英明正确领导下，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀下，在全国各兄弟民族人民支援帮助下，我们有信心和决心，继续发扬艰苦奋斗的优良作风，戒骄戒躁，密切联系群众，团结各阶层人民，提高政治警惕，鼓足更大的革命干劲，认真执行党的各项方针政策，积极地克服一切困难，不断克服工作中的缺点，努力做好工作，为建设民主和社会主义的新西藏而努力。
    以上请审议，不妥处请批评指正。（附图片）
