    The mass line is the Party's fundamental line. Whether we are doing work or engaging in production, we need to truly believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and humbly learn from the masses. There is no disagreement on this point.
    However, the opinions of the masses come from all sides and are not completely the same. This requires us to be good at listening to all sides in order to be comprehensive. We should not only accept the positive, but also consider the negative. We should not be prejudiced, nor should we ignore the opinions of a few. Only by adopting a humble attitude can we achieve "heeding all sides"; by "heeding all sides," we can distinguish right from wrong and concentrate the correct opinions of the masses.
    Why were the winter wheat field management measures of the Mengpai Brigade of the Pohu Commune in Changge County formulated so solidly and practically? One of the important reasons is that they valued the differing opinions of individuals. It is conceivable that if the Mengpai Brigade had not listened to the opinion that watering late-sown wheat was not good when mobilizing commune members to discuss winter watering of wheat fields, how could they have conducted a comparative experiment? Without comparative experiments, how could they have improved their understanding and found more scientific methods of managing wheat fields?

    兼听则明
    群众路线是党的根本路线。不论做工作还是搞生产，都需要真正相信群众，依靠群众，虚心向群众学习。对于这一点，人们没有异议。
    但是，群众意见来自各方，不完全相同，这就要求我们要善于倾听各方面的意见，才能做到全面。不但接受正面的，也要考虑反面的。不要先入为主，也不可忽视少数人的意见。只有抱着虚心的态度，才能作到“兼听”；“兼听”中能明辨是非，才能集中起群众正确的意见。
    长葛县坡胡公社孟排大队冬前小麦田间管理措施为什么能制订得如此扎扎实实、切合实际呢？其中重要原因之一，就是重视了个别人的不同意见。可以设想，孟排大队在发动社员讨论冬浇麦田的时候，如果不听听认为晚茬麦浇水不好的说法，怎么会进行一次对比试验呢？不经过对比试验，又怎能提高认识，找出更科学的管理麦田的方法呢？
