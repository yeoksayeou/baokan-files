Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 23rd - Jilin Province, from the Changbai Mountain area in the east to the Baicheng Grassland in the west, is universally launching winter sideline production activities such as hunting wild animals, catching fish and shrimp, collecting wild plants, weaving baskets and mats, refining nitrate and alkali, and raising poultry and livestock. Commune members, unafraid of the severe cold and hardship, have already harvested a large amount of sideline products. According to preliminary statistics up to December 20, the total sideline income in various parts of the province has reached more than 57.98 million yuan.

In the eastern Changbai Mountain area, logging and hunting activities have been widely carried out this winter. In the Yanbian area alone, more than 20,000 people have gone to the mountains for logging. In Dunhua County, in addition to more than 5,000 people engaged in timber production, 57 professional hunting teams have been organized. They have now hunted more than 4,500 wild boars and black bears, more than 1,700 pairs of pheasants, and more than 80,000 jin of fish. With other projects added, the income has exceeded one million yuan. In the western grassland areas, activities such as alkali refining, nitrate refining, reed harvesting, firewood gathering, hunting, and fishing have been widely carried out. In this area, Sheli Commune in Da'an County refined 430 tons of alkali and harvested 646 tons of reeds in twelve days. Recently, Sanhe and Qingshan Communes in Baicheng City mobilized more than 80 people after the snowfall and hunted more than 1,000 wild rabbits in just over four days. In the central plain areas, which are rich in grain and beans, weaving and other activities have been actively carried out. In addition, various localities have organized short-distance transportation according to needs and labor conditions.

This year, Jilin Province has reasonably divided the business scope for winter sideline production in various places. Under the unified leadership and planning of the commune, projects with concentrated raw materials and production are managed uniformly by the management district (the basic accounting unit of the commune); projects with smaller quantities and more scattered distribution are managed by the production team; and sporadic and small-scale projects are managed by individual commune members. At the same time, attention is paid to implementing the principle of distribution according to work, implementing labor quotas and over-quota rewards, and sideline income is distributed reasonably and promptly. These have further mobilized the enthusiasm of commune members to participate in sideline production.

This year, agricultural production in Jilin Province has suffered relatively severe natural disasters. According to the spirit of "making up for agricultural losses with sideline production," various localities have universally strengthened leadership over sideline production. Counties and cities have established sideline production headquarters or diversified management offices; communes and management districts have a secretary, president, or director specifically in charge of sideline production. Commercial departments are also stepping up procurement, supplying tools, and adjusting raw materials to support sideline production. The commercial department of Liaoyuan City has adjusted more than 600,000 jin of apricot branches and 30,000 bundles of sorghum stalks for Lishu Commune, and supplied more than 20,000 jin of "old fat grass." The supply and marketing cooperative of this commune sent 21 employees to the front line of production to sign transaction contracts with various production teams. At the same time, it adopted the method of organizing production while purchasing, and in half a month, it purchased a large number of sideline products such as earthen baskets, reed mats, wild fowl, and raw hides.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha - While doing a good job in current agricultural production, various parts of Hunan Province are properly arranging labor and carrying out winter sideline production. According to statistics from the beginning of November to December 9, the cash income from sideline production in various places has reached more than 30 million yuan. This has not only increased social wealth and the income of commune members, but also prepared funds for agricultural production.

Hunan Province has many mountains and rivers and abundant resources. In carrying out sideline production, various localities have proceeded from the actual local conditions, adhering to the principle of relying on mountains for sustenance and relying on water for sustenance, adapting to local conditions and using local materials, carrying out unified planning and comprehensive arrangements. Nian County in the Dongting Lake area, based on the characteristics of many lakes and abundant aquatic products, organized more than 20,000 people and more than 2,000 small boats throughout the county to engage in more than 40 kinds of sideline production such as fishing, digging lake lotus roots, hunting wild ducks, and cutting willow branches. Lukou Commune in Linxiang County, located in a mountainous area, organized more than 1,100 commune members with hunting experience to go hunting in the mountains this winter. In the first six days of December, they captured more than 210 wild animals such as tigers, wild boars, and goats.

In sideline production, various localities have clearly divided the business scope, adopted the method of large collectives grasping large-scale sideline industries and small collectives engaging in small-scale sideline industries, and organized commune members to carry out sporadic sideline production in their spare time, so as to give full play to the enthusiasm of organizations at all levels and commune members in managing sideline production. Wutong Brigade (basic accounting unit) of Tieshan Commune in Yueyang County conducted comprehensive planning for diversified management projects in sideline production. In view of the amount of labor, the size of costs, the amount of income, and the strength of seasonality, it determined that large-scale projects such as mining sand, extracting porcelain clay, and burning bricks and tiles should be operated by the brigade, while small-scale sideline industries such as short-distance transportation, hunting, and weaving grass bags should be operated by the small team. At the same time, commune members are encouraged to use their spare time and holidays to make straw sandals, catch fish and shrimp, dig medicinal materials, and collect various wild plants and other sideline industries, and all income belongs to individual commune members.

Commercial and financial departments in various places have actively organized sources of goods and strengthened the procurement of agricultural and sideline products. The supply and marketing department of Pujie Commune in Liuyang County sent cadres to the teams, fields, and factories to provide technical guidance and help them carry out 48 sideline production projects such as papermaking and nitrate refining. Since November, the entire commune has purchased more than 3,000 dan of various wild oilseeds, starch, etc., which has increased the entire commune's cash income by more than 240,000 yuan.

    全面妥善安排劳力　合理划分经营范围
    吉林湖南积极开展冬季副业生产
    靠山打猎近水捕鱼增加了社员收入准备了生产资金
    新华社长春23日电　吉林省从东部长白山区，到西部白城草原，普遍展开围打野物、捕捞鱼虾、采集野生植物、编织筐席、熬炼硝碱、饲养禽畜等冬季副业生产活动。公社社员们不畏严寒，不怕艰苦，已收获大量的副业产品。到12月20日为止的初步统计，全省各地副业收入已达五千七百九十八万多元。
    东部长白山区，今冬普遍展开了采伐、打猎等活动，仅延边地区上山采伐木材的就有两万多人。敦化县除有五千多人从事木业生产外，还组织了五十七个打猎专业队，现已猎获野猪、黑熊等四千五百多只、野鸡一千七百多对、打鱼八万多斤，加上其他项目，已收入一百多万元。西部草原地区，普遍地展开了熬碱、熬硝、打苇子、打柴、打猎、捕鱼等活动。这个地区的大安县舍力公社十二天就熬碱四百三十吨，打苇子六百四十六吨。白城市三河、青山两个公社最近在雪后出动八十多人，四天多就猎获野兔一千多只。盛产粮豆的中部平原地区，积极地展开了编织等活动。此外，各地还根据需要和劳动力等情况，组织了短途运输。
    今年吉林省各地冬季副业生产都合理地划分了经营范围，在公社的统一领导和规划下，对于原料和生产集中的项目，由管理区（公社基本核算单位）统一经营；数量较少和较分散的项目，由生产队经营；零星的、小宗的由社员个人经营。同时，注意贯彻按劳分配的原则，实行劳动定额和超额奖励制度，副业收入都及时合理地进行分配。这些都进一步调动了社员参加副业生产的积极性。
    吉林省今年农业生产遭受自然灾害比较严重，各地根据“农业受灾、副业补上”的精神，普遍加强了对副业生产的领导。各县、市成立了副业生产指挥部或多种经营办公室；公社、管理区都有一名书记、社长或主任专抓副业生产。商业部门也抓紧收购，供应工具，调剂原料，来支援副业生产。辽源市商业部门已为梨树公社调剂了杏条六十多万斤、秫秸三万捆，并且供应“老膘草”两万多斤。这个公社供销部抽出二十一名职工深入生产第一线，和各生产队签订交易合同，同时采取边组织生产，边收购的办法，半个月时间就收购了大量土篮子、席茓、野禽、元皮等副业产品。
    据新华社长沙电　湖南省各地在搞好当前农业生产的同时，妥善安排劳力，开展冬季副业生产。从11月上旬到12月9日统计，各地副业生产收入的现金已达三千多万元。不仅增加了社会财富和社员收入，还为农业生产准备了资金。
    湖南省山多水多，资源丰富，各地在开展副业生产中，都根据当地的具体情况，本着靠山吃山，靠水吃水，因地制宜，就地取材的原则，进行统一规划、全面安排。洞庭湖区的南县，根据境内湖泊多、水产丰富的特点，全县组织了二万多人和二千多只小船，大搞捕鱼、挖湖藕、打野鸭、砍柳条等四十多种副业生产。地处山区的临湘县路口公社，今冬组织了一千一百多个有打猎经验的社员，上山打猎，在12月的头六天中，就捕获老虎、野猪、山羊等野兽二百一十多只。
    在副业生产中，各地明确划分经营范围，采取大集体抓大宗副业，小集体搞小项副业的办法，并组织社员利用业余时间进行零星副业生产，以充分发挥各级组织和社员经营副业生产的积极性。岳阳县铁山公社五通大队（基本核算单位）在副业生产中，按多种经营项目，进行全面规划，针对花工多少，成本大小，收入多少，季节性强弱等情况，确定挖矿砂、掏瓷土、烧砖瓦等大宗项目由大队经营，短途运输、打猎、编草袋等小项副业由小队经营。同时，鼓励社员利用业余时间和假日打草鞋、捉鱼虾、挖药材和采集各种野生植物等副业，收入全部归社员个人。
    各地商业、财贸部门都积极组织货源，加强农副产品的收购工作。浏阳县普迹公社供销部门派出干部深入到队、到场、到厂进行技术指导，帮助他们开展了造纸、熬硝等四十八项副业生产。11月以来，全社共收购各种野生油料、淀粉等三千多担，使全社增加二十四万多元现金收入。
