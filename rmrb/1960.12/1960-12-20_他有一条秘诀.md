    He Has a Secret
    Kuang Jizhi, the leader of the Wanghui Production Team in the Foukǒu Management Area of our commune, excels in completing various work tasks. He has a secret: he acts according to the Party's policies, patiently educates the masses, and turns the Party's policies into the actual actions of the masses. This spring, the commune party committee called for reclaiming lakeshore wasteland to expand the planting area. After the task was assigned, some commune members said, "It's better to plant less than to plant more, and it's better to plant well than to plant more." Kuang Jizhi believed that this opinion had some merit, but it was not comprehensive, so he convened a forum of veteran farmers and commune member representatives, explaining the Party's policy of combining planting more with reaping more and high yield with reaping more. Through discussion, the commune members realized that to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, it was necessary to cultivate the existing land well and continuously improve the yield per unit area; however, this was only one important aspect of increasing grain production. As the saying goes, "Without thousands of acres of land, it's difficult to harvest ten thousand piculs of grain." If we want to increase grain production further, we must also expand the planting area. The commune members carefully calculated the increased yield from reclaiming wasteland, as well as the labor and animal power involved. They realized that the production team had the conditions to reclaim some wasteland on the basis of cultivating the existing land well, and they strengthened their confidence in reclaiming more wasteland and increasing production. Then, Kuang Jizhi made comprehensive arrangements for the team's labor, animal power, and farm implements, preparing for spring planting on the one hand and vigorously reclaiming wasteland on the other. The entire team completed the spring planting task on more than 470 mu of cultivated land five days ahead of schedule. At the same time, they also reclaimed 68 mu of lakeshore wasteland. This year, the crops on both the original land and the newly reclaimed land are growing very well, with a total increase of more than 15,000 jin of grain compared to last year.

    他有一条秘诀
    我们公社副口管理区王汇生产小队的小队长匡继芝，完成各项工作任务都很出色。他有一条秘诀就是按着党的政策办事，耐心教育群众，把党的政策变成群众的实际行动。今年春天，公社党委号召开垦湖荒，扩大种植面积。任务布置下来以后，有的社员就说：“多种不如少种，种多不如种好。”匡继芝认为这种意见有一方面的道理，但是，看法不全面，就召开了老农和社员代表开座谈会，说明了党的多种多收和高产多收相结合的方针。通过讨论，社员认识到了要大办农业、大办粮食，必须种好现有的地，不断地提高单位面积产量，但这只是增产粮食的一个重要方面；常言说：“没有千顷地、难收万石粮”，要想增产更多的粮食，还要扩大种植面积。社员们细致地算了开垦荒地增加产量的账，算了劳力畜力账，认识到这个生产小队有在种好现有土地的基础上再开垦一些荒地的条件，便坚定了多开荒、多增产的信心。接着匡继芝就全面安排了小队的劳力畜力和农具，一面做好春播准备，一面大力开荒。全队四百七十多亩耕地的春播任务，提前五天完成了，同时，又开垦了湖荒六十八亩。今年原有的土地和新开荒的土地上的庄稼都长得很好，比去年共增产粮食一万五千多斤。
