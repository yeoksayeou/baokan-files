    New Year's Gongs and Drums on the Red Land
    Ge Song
    These days, the newspapers are filled with good news from brotherly countries. With only a few days left until the New Year, the spring of 1961 is already revealing great news.
    In 1960, the Soviet Union's steel production increased by five million tons, oil extraction increased by eighteen million tons, and electricity increased by 30 billion kilowatt-hours. Many industrial and mining enterprises in Czechoslovakia completed the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule; Romanian steelworkers completed this year’s production task—the first year of the Six-Year Plan—ahead of schedule; Hungary’s Three-Year Plan will be overfulfilled; the socialist transformation in North Vietnam has achieved a decisive victory; Bulgaria’s total industrial output value next year will increase by 7.8% compared to this year…
    In this burst of jubilant gongs and drums, all we see are red characters of joy: ahead of schedule, overfulfilled, increased, and victory. These exciting words, these odes to numbers, show the growth of material wealth in the socialist camp, the infinite power of the socialist system, and even more so, the improved ideological awareness and soaring revolutionary enthusiasm of the socialist workers who have become masters of their country.
    Aren't we very familiar with the resounding name of the Soviet female worker Gaganova? Not only is she advanced in production herself, but she is also happy to work hand in hand with others to help them move forward with her. What kind of tree bears what kind of fruit? Only in the soil of socialism can such new people be created. In other socialist countries, the socialist labor competition is also developing vigorously, and Gaganova-style new people and Gaganova-style labor are appearing everywhere.
    In Albania, more than 10,000 workers across the country have participated in the "One Plus Two" socialist labor competition movement. Each member of the work team and workshop participating in this movement must take two apprentices, and each of these two apprentices must in turn take two apprentices. In this way, the accumulated production knowledge and experience are widely passed on to others. The scope of the Chollima Work Team movement in North Korea is also expanding. The slogan put forward by Korean workers is so loud: "Strive to go to the work teams that are lagging behind!" "For the next shift!" Don't leave accidents and problems to the next shift!
    In Poland, more than 100,000 people are participating in the competition for the title of "Socialist Labor Team"; in Hungary, more than 15,000 labor teams across the country are participating in the "Socialist Labor Team" competition; in Mongolia, the movement to strive for the title of "Socialist Labor Team" has also become a huge force to promote the progress of various undertakings!...
    Sunshine fills the land, and the east wind blows vigorously. The torrent of labor galloping forward not only promotes the rapid development of the socialist countries' economies, but also becomes a communist school for cultivating new people in socialist countries.
    This new communist spirit and quality is our most valuable treasure. The people of socialist countries understand that every ton of steel, every ton of grain, and every piece of labor product we produce is related to the strength of our entire camp and to the fate of all mankind. All the working people outside the socialist camp on Earth are yearning for this vast red land from the Elbe River to the East Korean Bay, seeing it as their tomorrow and their hope. Each of our good news, each advancing number, and each new victory takes a step towards our common goal—the victory of socialism in the world.
    These twelve brothers on the red land are moving forward hand in hand. In a chorus of triumph, I was attracted to another piece of news: on the Volga River in the Soviet Union, a great oil pipeline with a journey of thousands of miles has begun construction. It will cross borders and lead to Eastern European brotherly countries. By the end of next year, the Soviet Union will be able to transport oil to brotherly countries through this oil pipeline.
    The important issue is not oil. As the "Statement of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of All Countries" pointed out: The achievements of socialist countries and the entire socialist camp are due not only to the correct application of the common laws of socialist construction in accordance with the historical characteristics of each country and the interests of the entire socialist system, and the efforts of the people of these countries, but also to their close fraternal cooperation and internationalist mutual assistance, and first and foremost to the fraternal internationalist assistance of the Soviet Union.
    On the vast and fertile land of our socialist countries, this flower of internationalist brotherly friendship and mutual assistance is in full bloom. This flower, irrigated with the blood of countless proletarian fighters, has experienced wind, frost, rain, and snow, and will never wither. It has a long history and is endless, and it is needed at all times, just like the ancient Chinese saying, "Even if the seas run dry and the rocks crumble, this affection will not change." This force is enough to move mountains and seas, enough to make imperialism tremble and collapse!
    Let the New Year's gongs and drums on the red land beat even louder!

    红色土地上的新年锣鼓
    戈松
    这些天的报纸上，从兄弟国家来的捷报连翩飞舞。新年还有几天，1961年的春光却已经透露大好消息了。
    1960年，苏联的钢产量增加了五百万吨，石油开采量增加了一千八百万吨，电力增加了三百亿度。捷克斯洛伐克许多工矿企业提前完成第二个五年计划；罗马尼亚钢铁工人提前完成今年——六年计划头一年的生产任务；匈牙利三年计划将要超额完成；越南北方的社会主义改造取得了决定性的胜利；保加利亚明年的工业总产值将要比今年增加7.8％……
    在这一阵阵欢腾的锣鼓声中，我们见到的尽是提前、超额、增加、胜利这些红色的喜字。这些激动人心的字眼，这些数字的颂歌，表明了社会主义阵营物质财富的增长，表明了社会主义制度的威力无穷，更表明了做了国家主人的社会主义劳动者思想觉悟的提高，革命热情的高涨。
    我们不是很熟悉苏联女工加干诺娃的响亮的名字吗？她不仅自己在生产上先进，还乐于携手助人，让别人和她一道前进。什么样的树结什么样的果，只有社会主义的土壤里才能造就出这样的新人。在其他社会主义国家里社会主义劳动竞赛也正蓬蓬勃勃地发展，加干诺娃式的新人、加干诺娃式的劳动，正在到处出现。
    在阿尔巴尼亚全国已有一万多工人参加了“一加二”社会主义劳动竞赛运动，参加这个运动的工作队和车间，每个成员都要带两名徒弟，而这两名徒弟每人又分别另带两名徒弟。这样就把人们所积累的生产知识和经验广泛地传授给别人了。朝鲜千里马作业班运动发展的范围也越来越广。朝鲜工人提出的口号是这样响亮：“争取到工作落后的作业班去！”“为了下一班！”不把事故和问题留给下一班！
    在波兰单是参加争取“社会主义劳动队”称号竞赛运动的就有十几万人；在匈牙利全国有一万五千多个劳动队参加了“社会主义劳动队”竞赛；在蒙古争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的运动，也已成为推动各项事业前进的巨大力量！……
    阳光满地，东风劲吹。快马齐奔的劳动洪流，不仅推动着社会主义国家的经济迅速发展，而且也成为培养社会主义国家新人的共产主义学校。
    这种新的共产主义精神品质，是我们最宝贵的财富。社会主义国家的人民懂得：我们的每一吨钢，每一吨粮食，每一件劳动产品，都是关系着我们整个阵营的力量的，都是关系全人类命运的。地球上社会主义阵营以外的所有劳动人民，都在向往着从易北河到东朝鲜湾这一大片红色土地，把它看作自己的明天，自己的希望。我们的每一个捷报，每一个前进的数字，每一个新的胜利，都朝我们的共同目标——社会主义在全世界的胜利跨进了一步。
    在这红色土地上的十二个兄弟，正在携手前进。在一片凯歌声中，我又被一条消息吸引住了：在苏联伏尔加河，一条千万里行程的伟大的石油管开始建筑了，它将越过国境，通向东欧兄弟国家。到明年年底，苏联就可以通过这条石油管向兄弟国家输送石油。
    重要的问题不在于石油。正像《各国共产党和工人党代表会议声明》所指出的：社会主义各国和整个社会主义阵营所以获得成就，除了由于根据每个国家的历史特点和整个社会主义体系的利益正确地运用了社会主义建设的共同规律，由于这些国家人民的努力之外，很重要的一点是由于它们密切的兄弟般的合作和国际主义的相互援助，首先是由于苏联的兄弟般的国际主义的援助。
    在我们社会主义各国辽阔肥沃的土地上，盛放着这种国际主义兄弟友谊和相互援助的花朵。这种用无数无产阶级战士鲜血灌溉出来的花朵，经历过风霜雨雪，是永远开不败的。它源远流长，无穷无尽，到什么时候都需要，真像中国古语说的“海枯石烂，此情不移”。这个力量足以移山倒海，足以使帝国主义发抖直到崩溃！
    红色土地上的新年锣鼓，敲得更响亮吧！
