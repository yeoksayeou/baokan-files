Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 18th: More than 800 faculty and students from the mathematics departments of universities such as Jinan University and Zhongshan University in Guangdong Province, under the leadership of the Guangdong Provincial Science and Technology Commission and the Science and Technology Association, have gone to rural communes in Shantou, Foshan, Zhanjiang, Jiangmen and other regions, as well as counties on Hainan Island, and the suburbs of Guangzhou City, to promote linear programming in agricultural and farm machinery production, achieving certain results.

In October, when the teachers and students arrived in the countryside, it was the busy season of autumn harvest and winter planting. They used linear programming to help commune production teams formulate plans for the rational allocation of labor. Teachers and students from Jinan University helped the Sixth Team of the Yingnan Brigade of the Lile Commune in Xinhui County to develop a "one-dragon" program for autumn harvesting and winter planting (i.e., a coordinated process for cutting, threshing, drying, transporting, and managing). This enabled the team to complete the harvest volume, which originally took ten days, three days earlier. Teachers and students from Zhongshan University helped the Guipai and Mianqie Brigades of the Xindong Commune in Gaozhou County formulate a winter plowing cattle power allocation plan, and the implementation of the results increased work efficiency by 30%.

Teachers and students from various schools also assisted communes in formulating rational layout plans for various crop plantings. Vegetable production in the Linhe Brigade of the Shahe Commune in the suburbs of Guangzhou City had been poorly planned in the past, failing to meet the requirements for multiple varieties and balanced market supply. Teachers and students from Guangzhou Normal College, based on the principles of linear programming, used graphical operation methods to help them formulate a winter planting plan for vegetables, planting various vegetables in reasonable proportions and layouts, gradually achieving multiple varieties and balanced market supply on the basis of the original manpower and materials.

The teachers and students also helped local farm machinery factories apply linear programming in production. Teachers and students from Zhongshan University used linear programming principles to help the Gaozhou County Farm Machinery Factory achieve a 100% steel plate utilization rate. Teachers and students from Guangdong Normal College, using linear programming principles to help the Shantou Farm Machinery Factory improve the method of cutting materials for hoe production, also achieved a significant increase in material utilization. Previously, the farm tool factory of the Lile Commune in Xinhui County used a bundled work method to produce hoes, producing only 25 hoes per day. Teachers and students from Jinan University, based on linear programming principles, helped them adopt an assembly line operation method, which enabled them to produce 50 hoes per day under the same equipment conditions.

The teachers and students also applied linear programming to local transportation work, playing a certain role in accelerating the circulation of rural commodities.

Under the leadership and support of party committees at all levels, teachers and students from various schools vigorously carried out the popularization of linear programming. In more than a month, these schools assisted in training more than 11,000 students in various places.

This newspaper reports: The "July 1st" People's Commune in Shanghai County, with the help of teachers and students from the Mathematics Department of East China Normal University, vigorously promoted operations research and linear programming in the three-autumn battle, saving a large amount of labor. The Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Association has introduced their experience to more than 100 communes in the suburbs of Shanghai, promoting it in a comprehensive and active manner.

The promotion of linear programming in the "July 1st" Commune is closely integrated with the implementation of the "major contracting and small assessment" system in agricultural production. In promoting linear programming, the eighteen production teams of the commune conducted detailed investigations and research on the three-autumn tasks, formulated plans, and implemented each task down to the team, group, and even each plot of land. At the same time, the technical strengths and weaknesses of the labor force in each team were also ranked, and the work was rationally divided according to the task requirements, so that each labor force was used effectively. Each team formulated "small-stage plans" according to the production team's plan, formulated "ten-day, three-day" action plans based on the principle of the "table operation method" of linear programming, and implemented the working method of arranging tomorrow's work today, changing the past method of allocating work based on the total number of people and estimating percentages. The Mingxing Production Team assigned commune members with experience in rice harvesting to harvest rice, and selected rice harvesting experts to harvest the difficult-to-cut rice on both sides of the ridges, pairing weaker laborers behind them. On the first day of harvesting, efficiency increased by more than 50%.

In this three-autumn period, the "July 1st" Commune, through the promotion of linear programming, rationally set up the locations of threshing grounds and warehouses, realized the alignment of threshing grounds and paddy fields, and linked threshing grounds, warehouses, and transportation lines, which also saved a lot of labor. According to the principles of linear programming, the location and size of warehouses and threshing grounds were adjusted and arranged, and some temporary threshing grounds were added, so that the paddy fields and threshing grounds were aligned, and the distance for carrying rice was greatly shortened. Warehouses were also set up next to the threshing grounds, so that the threshed grain could be stored nearby. In this way, the commune could save 12,500 man-days in the task of carrying rice alone. In terms of autumn planting, the method of harvesting one piece and planting one piece was adopted, and the labor force was also rationally arranged. Due to the adoption of linear programming principles, the idle time of the 14 tractors in the commune was reduced, and each tractor could plow eight more mu per day, thereby expanding the area of mechanized farming and saving the labor force used for manual plowing. The three-autumn (harvesting, planting, and management) tasks of the commune this year originally required more than 536,000 man-days, but now only 324,000 man-days are needed, saving a total of more than 212,000 man-days and increasing work efficiency by about 40%.

    暨南、中山大学帮助公社制定线性规划
    上海县推广“七一”公社使用运筹学经验
    据新华社广州18日电　广东省暨南、中山大学等高等学校的数学系八百多名师生，在广东省科学技术委员会和科学技术协会的领导下，分赴汕头、佛山、湛江、江门等专区和海南岛各县，以及广州市郊的农村公社，在农业和农械厂的生产中推广线性规划，取得一定的成绩。
    10月间，各校师生来到农村的时候，正值秋收冬种的农忙季节。他们运用线性规划，协助公社生产队制定合理安排劳动力的方案。暨南大学师生帮助新会县礼乐公社英南大队第六小队拟出了秋收冬种一条龙（即割、打、晒、运、管理等作业的配套成龙）的方案，使这个小队原来要十天才能完成的收割量提前三天完成。中山大学师生帮助高州县新垌公社贵牌和缅茄大队制定的冬耕牛力分配方案，实行结果，提高工效30％。
    各校师生还协助公社制定了各种农作物种植合理布局方案。广州市郊沙河公社林和大队的蔬菜生产，过去计划性差，不能达到多品种和均衡上市的要求。广州师范学院师生根据线性规划的原理，用图表作业法帮助他们制定了蔬菜冬种规划，按合理的比例和布局种植各种蔬菜，在原有人力、物力的基础上，使生产逐渐达到多品种和均衡上市的要求。
    师生们还帮助当地农械厂在生产中应用线性规划。中山大学师生运用线性规划原理，帮助高州县农械厂，使钢板利用率达到100％。广东师范学院师生，采用线性规划原理帮助汕头农械厂改进生产锄头下料办法后，使材料利用率也有较明显的提高。新会县礼乐公社农具厂以前用一揽子工作方法生产锄头，每天只生产二十五张，暨南大学师生根据线性规划原理帮助他们采用流水作业法，在同样设备条件下，每天能生产锄头五十张。
    师生还把线性规划应用在当地交通运输工作上，对加速农村商品流转方面起了一定作用。
    各校师生在各级党委的领导和支持下，大力开展了线性规划的普及工作。在一个多月的时间里，这些学校分别协助各地训练了一万一千多个学员。
    本报讯　上海县“七一”人民公社在三秋战斗中，在华东师范大学数学系的师生帮助下，大力推行运筹学线性规划，节省了大批劳动力。上海市科学技术协会已把他们的经验介绍给上海市郊区一百多个公社，全面积极推广。
    “七一”公社推行线性规划是与贯彻农业生产中的“大包小评”制度密切结合进行的。全社十八个生产队推行线性规划中，对三秋任务进行了详细的调查研究，订出计划，把每项任务落实到小队、小组以至每块田里；同时对各队劳动力的技术特长和劳力强弱的情况也排了队，根据任务要求合理分工，使每个劳动力都用在刀口上。各小队按照生产队的计划订出“小段计划”，根据线性规划“表上作业法”的原理，订出“每十天、每三天”行动计划，实现明日工作今天安排的工作方法，改变了过去只是根据人力总数，以百分比推算“毛估估”的派工方法。明星生产队把对割稻有经验的社员分配去割稻，而且选择割稻的能手去收割畦地两边难割的稻子，把劳力较弱的搭配在他们的后面，收割第一天，效率就提高了50％以上。
    在这次三秋中，‘七一’公社通过线性规划的推行，合理设置打谷场和仓库的地点，实现了打谷场和稻田对号，打谷场、仓库和运输线联结在一起，也节省了大量劳动力。按照线性规划原理，把仓库和打谷场的位置、大小进行调整和安排，并且增设了一些临时打谷场，使稻田和打谷场对起号来，挑稻距离也大大缩短，还在打谷场旁边设置仓库，使脱粒的谷子可就近储存，这样全社仅挑稻一项任务就可以节省一万二千五百个人工。在秋种方面，采取收一块、种一块，劳动力也得到了合理安排。由于采用线性规划原理，减少全社十四辆拖拉机空驶的时间，每辆每天可以多耕八亩，从而扩大了机耕面积，可以节省使用人工翻土耕种的劳动力。全社今年三秋（收、种、管）任务原来需要五十三万六千多人工，现在只需要三十二万四千多人工就可以了，共可节约二十一万二千多人工，提高工效40％左右。
