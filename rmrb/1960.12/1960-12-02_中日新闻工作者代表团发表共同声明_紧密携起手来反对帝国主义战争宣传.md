Joint Statement

The Japanese Journalists' Delegation visited the People's Republic of China again after attending the Second Meeting of World Journalists in Baden, Austria, in October 1960.

The Chinese and Japanese Journalists' Delegations held friendly talks on the achievements of the Baden meeting and the issue of cooperation between the journalists of the two countries, and reached a completely unanimous opinion.

1. The Baden meeting achieved brilliant success in holding high the banner of peace, anti-imperialism, democracy, and national independence, and in consolidating the unity of world journalists. The Chinese and Japanese delegations expressed their complete satisfaction with the achievements of the meeting. The victory of the meeting is the result of the united efforts of journalists from all over the world, and the cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese journalists' delegations was also an important factor. Most of the speakers at the meeting, especially the representatives from Asia,Africa, andLatin America, pointed out the crimes of the imperialists and colonialists, headed by the United States. They reported on the struggles of the people of all countries to win peace, independence, prosperity, and to develop national independent journalism. They emphasized that it is more important than ever today for journalists to provide truthful reports, expose the hypocrisy and distortion of imperialism, and this reflects the common aspiration of journalists around the world.

2. Both sides expressed their full support for the resolutions of the Baden meeting and believe that these resolutions should be the basis for the unity and cooperation of the vast number of journalists in the world today. The journalists of the two countries are willing to do their utmost to firmly implement these resolutions, strengthen contact with colleagues from all countries, and support all concrete actions taken by journalists from all countries to implement these resolutions.

3. It is of particular importance to work hard to promote the convening of the Asian-African Journalists' Conference proposed at the Baden meeting. The success of this conference will contribute to the struggle of the people of all countries against imperialism, colonialism, and their agents, and will also be very beneficial in resolving the professional difficulties of journalists in this region and in strengthening mutual cooperation and support. At present, the struggle against the imperialist news monopoly in this region is rapidly expanding. The development of the international situation is increasingly favorable to the cause of the people of all countries in striving for world peace, national independence, democracy and progress, and increasingly unfavorable to the imperialists and colonialists headed by the United States. Under such a favorable situation, the development and consolidation of an independent and autonomous journalistic undertaking that meets the aspirations of the people has become a common demand of the people and journalists of many countries. Mutual support and promotion of the development of this cause is an extremely important task for journalists in this region. The Japanese delegation stated that it is prepared to provide as much convenience as possible for the convening and success of the Asian-African Journalists' Conference, and the Chinese delegation welcomed this. Both sides fully support the patriotic and just struggle of the people and journalists of Latin America against imperialism, and highly appreciate the efforts of honest journalists in North America and Europe to report truthfully under difficult circumstances.

4. Both sides are extremely satisfied to see the positive results produced by the close cooperation between Chinese and Japanese journalists in the past, and unanimously believe that new and favorable conditions have now been created for expanding and strengthening cooperation. Journalists of the two countries should unite more closely to support the people's struggle to ease tensions in Asia and the world, safeguard peace, establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Asia and the Pacific region, withdraw U.S. troops from all parts of Asia, and crush the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, and should strive to oppose imperialist war propaganda and eliminate the "Cold War."

Chinese journalists express their full support for the struggle of Japanese journalists to resist the oppression of the Japanese and U.S. reactionaries, safeguard democratic rights, improve their social and economic status, expand and strengthen unity, and for the struggle to restore diplomatic relations between the two countries.

The Japanese Journalists' Delegation's visit to China and the cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese delegations in Baden prove that they are the closest comrades-in-arms. Both sides guarantee to support and encourage each other and work hand in hand in future common struggles. Based on the above satisfactory consensus, in order to further strengthen the cooperation between the journalists of the two countries, the Japanese delegation, entrusted by the Japan Congress of Journalists, invited the Chinese Journalists' Delegation to visit Japan at an appropriate time, and the Chinese side gladly accepted this invitation.

The Chinese press expresses its highest respect for the heroic efforts of Japanese journalists to faithfully report on the historical struggle of the Japanese people against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The Japanese delegation expresses its heartfelt gratitude to the All-China Journalists Association for its reception.

    共同声明
    日本新闻工作者代表团在出席1960年10月于奥地利巴登举行的世界新闻工作者第二次会见大会之后，再次访问了中华人民共和国。
    中国新闻工作者代表团和日本新闻工作者代表团就巴登会见的成就和两国新闻工作者的合作问题进行了友好的会谈，取得了完全一致的意见。
    1、巴登会见在高举和平、反帝、民主、民族独立的旗帜，巩固世界新闻工作者的团结方面取得了光辉的成就。中日两国代表团对会见的成就表示十分满意。会见的胜利是世界各国新闻工作者团结努力的结果，而中日两国新闻工作者代表团的合作也是重要因素之一。参加会见的大多数发言者，特别是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的代表指出了以美国为首的帝国主义和殖民主义者的罪恶，报告了各国人民为争取和平、独立、繁荣和为发展民族的独立的新闻事业而斗争的情况，强调新闻工作者进行真实报道，揭破帝国主义的虚伪和歪曲的宣传，在今天比以往任何时候更为重要。这反映了目前全世界新闻工作者的共同愿望。
    2、双方对巴登会见各项决议表示完全支持，认为这些决议应当是目前世界广大新闻工作者团结合作的基础。两国新闻工作者愿意尽自己最大的努力坚定地执行这些决议，并加强同各国同业的接触，支持各国新闻工作者为执行这些决议所采取的一切具体行动。
    3、努力促成巴登会见大会上建议召开的亚非新闻工作者会议，具有特别重要的意义。这个会议的成功必将对各国人民反对帝国主义、殖民主义及其代理人的斗争，作出贡献，同时在解决这一地区的新闻工作者的职业上的各种困难，在加强相互合作和支援方面极有好处。现在这一地区反对帝国主义者的新闻垄断的斗争，正在迅速扩大。国际形势的发展，越来越有利于各国人民争取世界和平、民族独立、民主与进步事业，越来越不利于以美国为首的帝国主义者和殖民主义者。在这样有利的形势下，发展和巩固符合人民愿望的独立自主的新闻事业，成为许多国家人民和新闻工作者的共同要求。相互支持和促进这一事业的发展，是这一地区新闻工作者的一项极其重要的任务。日本代表团表示为了亚非记者会议的召开和成功，准备尽可能地提供方便条件，中国代表团对此表示欢迎。双方完全支持拉丁美洲人民和新闻工作者反对帝国主义的爱国正义斗争，并对北美和欧洲各国的正直的新闻工作者在困难情况下为报道真实而进行的努力，给予很高的评价。
  4、双方极其满意地看到，中日两国新闻工作者在过去由于紧密的合作所产生的积极的结果，并一致认为：现在已经产生了为扩大和加强合作的新的有利条件。两国新闻工作者更紧密地携起手来，支持人民为缓和亚洲和世界紧张局势、维护和平、在亚洲和太平洋地区建立无核武器区、使美军从亚洲各地撤走、粉碎日美军事同盟条约的斗争，并且要为反对帝国主义的战争宣传和消除“冷战”而努力。
    中国新闻工作者对日本新闻工作者为了反抗日美反动派的压迫、维护民主权利、提高他们的社会和经济地位和扩大加强团结而进行的斗争，以及为恢复两国邦交而进行的斗争，表示全面的支持。
    日本新闻工作者代表团这次访问中国和中日两国代表团在巴登的合作，证明他们是最亲密的战友，双方保证在今后的共同斗争中，互相支持，互相鼓舞，携手并进。根据上述令人满意的一致意见，为了进一步加强两国新闻工作者的合作，日本代表团受日本记者会议的委托，邀请中国新闻工作者的代表团在适当的时期访问日本，中国方面高兴地接受了这一邀请。
    中国新闻界对日本新闻工作者为忠实报道日本人民反对日美“安全条约”的历史性的斗争而进行的英勇努力，表示崇高的敬意。日本代表团对中华全国新闻工作者协会的接待表示衷心的谢意。
