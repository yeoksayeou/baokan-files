Xinhua News Agency, Havana, December 20th. Cuban Premier Castro, at the closing session of the All-Cuba Sugar Workers' Congress held here this morning, called on 500,000 sugar agriculture workers to sharpen their machetes and prepare to welcome the next sugar harvest season. At the same time, he called for strengthening militia battalions to prevent sabotage activities by counter-revolutionaries and imperialists.

He condemned the United States' cancellation of Cuba's sugar import quota as an "imperialist act of cowardice and barbaric aggression." He said, "In order to oppose the revolution, imperialism is also using blood-stained dollars to buy off the worst elements in an attempt to bring down Cuba." However, Castro said, "The answer will definitely not be what they expect: the surrender of our people. Our answer is: Prepare to struggle, fight, work, and win victory! They will continue to be defeated."

Castro said that Cuba will harvest and process all planted sugarcane next year and continue to supply the world market. He pointed out that socialist countries will purchase four million tons of sugar from Cuba according to agreements, along with 300,000 tons for the domestic market and over one million tons allocated on the world market.

Speaking of Cuba's 1961 production plan, Castro said that the government will continue to invest 200 million pesos in agriculture and strive to eliminate the "dead season" in monoculture and production. He said that the number of newly employed people in rural areas next year will reach approximately 200,000.

He talked about the Cuban government's plans to overcome monoculture, saying that this will be done through sugarcane cooperatives and people's farms. He said that the existing 614 sugarcane cooperatives, in addition to growing sugarcane, have also planted nearly 4,000 caballerías of land with other crops. In addition, each sugarcane cooperative has an average of 59 dairy cows and 7 caballerías of pasture. Next year, construction will also begin on 1,000 pig farms.

He said that 300,000 caballerías of land will be freed up in the future to develop diverse crops.

He said that Cuba's agriculture will be divided into three sectors, three production systems: cooperative production, with sugarcane cooperatives as its basic core; people's farm production, with the former livestock estates, which have become technological production centers, as its basic core; and small peasant production, with the former sugarcane, coffee, and cocoa tenant farmers and tobacco sharecroppers as its basic core.

He said that the government will not force any small farmers to establish cooperatives. If they are willing to organize cooperatives, the government will provide them with assistance.

Castro said that soon Cuba's agricultural production will move forward through three huge organizations: the National Sugarcane Cooperative Administration, the National People's Farm Administration, and the Small Farmers Association. He pointed out, "In this stage, agriculture is developing much faster than industry, and in the development of agriculture, industry will also begin to receive tremendous development."

Castro finally called on the Cuban people to prepare for a long and arduous struggle. He said that they should not exchange future benefits for current temporary gains, but should exchange present sacrifices for future benefits. He emphasized, "The Cuban people will continue to shatter the enemy's delusions and consolidate the revolution next year."

    卡斯特罗总理号召人民进行长期艰苦斗争
    古巴人民决心用战斗和劳动赢得胜利
    农业将通过合作社、人民农场和小农生产三种形式获得迅速发展
    新华社哈瓦那20日电　古巴总理卡斯特罗今天早晨在这里举行的糖业工人全体大会闭幕会上号召五十万糖业农业工人磨利砍刀，准备好迎接下一个榨糖季节。他同时号召加强民兵营，防止反革命分子和帝国主义者的破坏活动。
    他谴责美国取消从古巴进口的食糖分额是“帝国主义式的懦怯和野蛮的侵略行动”。他说，“为了反对革命，帝国主义还用沾满血污的美元收买最坏的家伙企图来搞垮古巴。”但是，卡斯特罗说，“回答决不是他们所期望那样：我国人民投降。我们的回答是：准备进行斗争，战斗，劳动和赢得胜利！他们将继续遭到失败。”
    卡斯特罗说，古巴明年将砍收和压榨所有种植的甘蔗，继续供应世界市场。他指出，社会主义国家将根据协定向古巴购买四百万吨糖，同时还有三十万吨的国内市场和一百多万吨世界市场上的分额。
    在谈到古巴1961年的生产计划时，卡斯特罗说，政府将继续在农业上投资二亿比索，并且努力消除单一种植和生产上的“死季”。他说，明年在农村新就业的人数将达二十万人左右。
    他谈到古巴政府在克服单一种植方面的计划时说，这将通过甘蔗合作社和人民农场来进行。他说，已有的六百一十四个甘蔗合作社除了种植甘蔗以外，还播种了近四千卡瓦耶里亚土地的其他作物。此外，每个甘蔗合作社平均拥有五十九头乳牛和七卡瓦耶里亚的牧场。明年还将开始建设一千个养猪场。
    他说，今后要腾出三十万卡瓦耶里亚的土地用来发展多种作物。
    他说，古巴的农业将分为三个部门，三个生产体系：合作社生产，其基本核心是甘蔗合作社；人民农场的生产，其基本核心是已经变成技术化生产中心的过去的畜牧业庄园；小农生产，其基本核心是过去的甘蔗、咖啡和可可佃农以及烟草伙耕农。
    他说，政府不会强迫任何小农建立合作社。如果他们愿意组织合作社，政府将给他们提供援助。
    卡斯特罗说，不久古巴的农业生产就将通过三个巨大的组织向前发展：全国甘蔗合作社管理局、全国人民农场管理局和小农协会。他指出，“在这个阶段中，农业比工业发展快得多，而在农业发展中，工业也将开始得到巨大的发展”。
    卡斯特罗最后号召古巴人民准备进行长期的艰苦斗争。他说，不应用将来去换取目前暂时的利益，而要用现在的牺牲来换取将来的利益。他强调指出，“古巴人民将在明年继续粉碎敌人的妄想和巩固革命”。
