Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 2nd: Despite the government's attempts to entice them, an increasing number of Japanese youth are unwilling to enlist and sacrifice themselves for the American and Japanese reactionaries.

    The Japanese "Defense Agency" submitted information to the Senate Cabinet Committee on December 1st, admitting that fewer and fewer Japanese youth are enlisting in the army, navy, and air force. Coupled with the increasing number of retirements from the military, the shortfall in personnel in the three Japanese services has reached over 20,000.

    The information stated that the personnel shortage is particularly serious in the army, with a shortfall of over 18,000, marking the highest record of personnel shortages since the establishment of the Ground "Self-Defense Force" ten years ago.

    新华社2日讯　东京消息：尽管政府千方百计地诱骗，但是日本越来越多的青年不愿当兵为美日反动派流血卖命。
    日本“防卫厅”1日向参议院内阁委员会提出的资料承认，日本青年应募参加陆、海、空军的越来越少。再加上军队中退职者增多，日本三军兵员缺额已达两万多人。
    这项资料说，兵员缺额现象尤以陆军最为严重，共缺额一万八千多名，为陆上“自卫队”创立十年以来兵员缺额的最高纪录。
