    Promote the Spirit of Long-Term Planning, Thrift, and Entrepreneurship

    On December 21, the Hebei Daily published an editorial entitled "Promote the Spirit of Long-Term Planning, Thrift, and Entrepreneurship," praising the glorious achievements made by the peasants of Nanwangzhuang, Shen County, Hebei Province, who were praised by Chairman Mao as "the direction of 500 million peasants," for their five years of thrift and entrepreneurship. The following is an excerpt:

    The three poor peasant households of Wang Yukun, Wang Xiaoqi, and Wang Xiaopang, known throughout the country as "the direction of 500 million peasants," together with the members of their team, have made glorious achievements in thrift and entrepreneurship over the past five years.

    The moving deeds of this production team in long-term planning and thrift reflect the heroic spirit of our country's working people who are unafraid of difficulties. Their victory in changing their poor and backward appearance is a victory for the Party's general line for socialist construction, a victory for the Party's leadership, and also a victory for their long-term planning and hard work.

    What enlightenment does the glorious deeds of the Nanwangzhuang production team give us, and what valuable experiences does it provide for us to learn?

    Long-term planning and thrift require a clear goal to strive for. The reason why Nanwangzhuang has been able to win victory after victory and take the initiative step by step over the past five years is that they have both lofty goals to strive for and steps and practical measures to achieve these goals. In this way, they can withstand the test of any difficulty. Although it is the same Nanwangzhuang, some people were once worried about the future of this poor village, but Wang Yukun, Wang Xiaoqi, Wang Xiaopang, and others saw great hope in the Party's leadership and the members of the commune. When the flood attacked Nanwangzhuang, those who were not firm enough felt that "if we don't flee the famine, we will only starve to death." However, they did not borrow money from the state, did not spend a penny, and organized eighteen kinds of sideline occupations, overcame the disaster, and laid a material foundation for a bumper harvest in the coming year. It is also because the cadres and commune members are armed with the idea of persistent and thrifty entrepreneurship under the predetermined goal, they did not waver in their determination to achieve the "National Program for Agricultural Development" eight years ahead of schedule in the event of a disaster. After achieving the program, they immediately made plans to completely turn over agricultural production. This spirit of continuous revolution, in which the previous stage prepares for the next stage, and the practice of constantly increasing concrete measures to achieve the established goals, is the reason why Nanwangzhuang is invincible in the struggle for production, and it is also the reason why the production appearance of Nanwangzhuang is changing day by day and year by year, and the revolutionary enthusiasm hidden in the people is being more and more fully developed.

    The fundamental change in the natural appearance of Nanwangzhuang, the substantial increase in grain and cotton production year after year, is also the result of long-term planning and the most economical use of human, material, and financial resources. Many people have been to Nanwangzhuang, and when they see the uneven land turned into flat square fields, the mechanical wells and canals where there is no land that cannot be irrigated, and the prosperous scene of grain production achieving the program target and crossing the Yellow River, they all feel surprised and admire it. However, these changes did not happen overnight, but were accumulated bit by bit, month after month, and year after year. It is the result of the struggle to use the most economical use of human, material, and financial resources to strive for the greatest results. The experience of Nanwangzhuang tells us that there will be struggles to do this. There is a struggle between long-term planning and no planning, and there is a struggle between thrift and waste. During the period when Nanwangzhuang was catching up with the level of wealthy middle peasants, it fought against the idea of simply relying on state loans. When achieving the targets of the "National Program for Agricultural Development," it fought against the phenomenon of not cherishing human, material, and financial resources.

    All production teams should learn from Nanwangzhuang's experience of long-term planning and thrift, combine it with the current practical activities of implementing policies, improving work style, and doing a good job in production and life, and transform the idea of long-term planning and thrift into the masses, so that it becomes a driving force to promote production teams and small teams to manage their own production and life better, and to do a better job in this year's winter production and preparations for winning a bumper harvest next year.

### 发扬持久打算勤俭创业精神

    发扬持久打算勤俭创业精神
    12月21日，河北日报发表题为“发扬持久打算勤俭创业精神”的社论，表扬了为毛主席誉为“五亿农民的方向”的河北深县南王庄农民五年来勤俭创业所取得的光辉成就。摘要如下：
    以“五亿农民的方向”闻名全国的三户贫农王玉坤、王小其和王小庞，和他们队的社员一起，五年来在勤俭创业方面做出了光辉的成就。
    这个生产队持久打算、勤俭创业的动人事迹，反映了我国劳动人民不怕困难的英雄气概。他们改变穷困落后面貌的胜利，是党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利，是党的领导的胜利，也是他们持久打算、艰苦奋斗的胜利。
    南王庄生产队的光辉事迹给了我们哪些启示，提供了哪些值得学习的经验呢？
    持久打算、勤俭创业需要有一个明确的奋斗目标。南王庄五年来所以能够节节胜利，步步主动，就在于他们既有远大的奋斗目标，又有实现这个目标的步骤和切实可行的措施。这样，就使得他们经得起任何困难的考验。同是一个南王庄，曾经有人为这个穷村的前途担忧，王玉坤、王小其、王小庞等却从党的领导和社员身上看到了伟大的希望。大水袭击了南王庄，不够坚定的人觉得“不逃荒只有饿死”。他们却不向国家贷款，没有花一元钱，便组织起十八种副业，渡过了灾荒，还为来年丰收打下了物质基础。也正是因为在预定目标下面，以坚韧不拔的勤俭创业思想武装了干部和社员，在遇到灾荒的情况下没有动摇提前八年实现农业发展纲要的决心。在实现了纲要以后，紧接着又作出了让农业生产彻底翻身的打算。这种前一段为下一段作好准备的不断革命精神，和不断增加实现既定目标的具体措施的作法，是南王庄在生产斗争中所向披靡的原因所在，也是南王庄的生产面貌天天在变，年年在变，蕴藏在人民群众中的革命积极性愈来愈得到充分发挥的原因所在。
    南王庄根本改变自然面貌，粮食、棉花连年大幅度增产，又是一切作长期打算、最节省的使用人力物力财力的结果。很多人到过南王庄，看到起伏不平的土地变成平坦的方田，看到无地不可浇的机井和渠道，看到粮食生产实现纲要指标又越过黄河的繁荣景象，莫不感到惊奇和佩服。可是，这些变化，不是一个早晨变来的，而是一文钱一点物、月复一月、年复一年的点滴积累起来的。是以最节省的使用人力物力财力，力求换取最大成效的斗争换来的。南王庄的经验告诉我们：要这样做是会有斗争的。持久打算和毫无打算两者之间有斗争，节约和浪费两者之间有斗争。南王庄在赶上富裕中农水平期间，与单纯依赖国家贷款的思想做了斗争，在实现农业发展纲要指标时，和不珍惜人力、物力、财力的现象做了斗争。
    所有的生产队都应该很好地学习南王庄持久打算勤俭创业的经验，结合当前贯彻政策、改进作风、搞好生产生活的实际活动，把持久打算、勤俭创业的思想化到群众中去，使之成为一种动力，推动生产队和小队把自己的生产生活办得更好，把今年的冬季生产和明年夺取大丰收的准备工作搞得更好。
