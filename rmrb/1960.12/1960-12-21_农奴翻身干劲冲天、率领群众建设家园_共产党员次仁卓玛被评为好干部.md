Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 20th – Tsering Drolma, a Tibetan female cadre and Communist Party member in the Woka District of Sangri County, Tibet, has been diligently implementing the Party's policies in her work, caring for the production and lives of the farmers, and adhering to the principles of eating, living, laboring, and consulting with the masses. She is known by the people as a "good cadre" and a "confidante."

Four years ago, Tsering Drolma was still a slave who suffered greatly under the oppression of the lords. In 1956, she broke free from the shackles of the serf owners, began working, and was later sent to the Tibetan Public School in Xianyang, Shaanxi, for study. After the armed rebellion launched by the reactionary upper strata of Tibet was quelled, she returned to Tibet in June of last year and immediately plunged into the great democratic reform movement. Under the Party's cultivation and education, her class consciousness and working ability have continuously improved, and she has honorably joined the Communist Party of China. She has been commended and rewarded three times by the Sangri County Party Committee and the Sangri County People's Government, and was recently named an advanced worker, attending the Tibet Autonomous Region's Conference of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers.

During the democratic reform movement last year, Tsering Drolma often used her past experience as a *langsheng* (slave) for the serf owners to inspire and guide the poor serfs and slaves to pour out their bitterness and dig out the roots of their poverty. Under the leadership of the Party, the local masses launched a vigorous democratic reform movement, destroying the rule of the feudal serf system. In February of this year, when the farmers of Sangri County carried out activities to prepare for spring plowing, the Woka District Party Committee transferred Tsering Drolma to this area. As soon as she arrived in Heilong Township, she moved her luggage into the home of Qimei Pingcuo, a poor serf, and worked in the fields with the mutual aid team members every day, while also learning about the situation and publicizing the Party's policies to the team members. When she was working with the members of Qimei Yangji's mutual aid team, she learned that the team's implementation of the principle of mutual benefit was not good enough. She then convened a meeting of team members, fully promoting democracy, so that the issue of mutual benefit was reasonably resolved, strengthening unity within the team, and bringing the team's labor attendance rate to 100%, making the spring plowing preparation work a resounding success.

Last winter, Tsering Drolma went from Xie Village to Mo Village. She found that more than seventy *ke* of land (one *ke* is approximately equal to one *mu*) in this village were all on the hillside, without irrigation. The masses were only busy accumulating fertilizer and not building water conservancy projects. Some farmers told her: "Even the water for people to drink has to be carried from a very far place, and growing crops can only rely on the heavens." Tsering Drolma thought to herself: "It all depends on human effort. Emancipated farmers, under the leadership of the Party, will certainly be able to create miracles that predecessors never dreamed of." She said to everyone: "If the water in the ditch can't be lifted up, can't we divert the water from the mountain down?" In order to convince everyone with facts, she led activists Danzeng and Mingjiu to climb mountains and cross ridges to explore for water. They discovered seven small natural streams on Mount Ge'a. Although the water volume was small, it could still be used to irrigate the fields if diverted down the mountain. Tsering Drolma then actively helped the masses design a plan based on the water source situation, using the spring water from Mount Ge'a and the snow water from Mount Liji Ling to irrigate the land. On the second day of exploring the water source, eighteen young men and women in the village braved the severe cold to repair the canal. In just fifteen days, they built a large canal on Mount Ge'a and built a dam at the foot of Mount Liji Ling, so that the water that originally flowed into the river in vain flowed into the village along the repaired canal. Seeing the water flowing into the fields, the farmers were very excited. Eighty-five-year-old Sangzhu Gemu said: "The life-saving water that could not be solved for thousands of years has now been solved. Our descendants will always remember the kindness of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and will always remember the good cadres sent by the Party and Chairman Mao."

Tsering Drolma not only loves labor but also attaches great importance to learning production technology and improving production efficiency. In more than a year, she has learned production techniques such as plowing, sowing, making fine fertilizer, and field management. In order to implement the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture and promote new technologies, she planted an experimental plot, took the lead in learning to use new-style walking plows, and changed from broadcasting to row sowing. Local farmers did not have the habit of applying topdressing fertilizer, so she educated the farmers with typical examples and learned from foreign fertilizer-making experiences, creating a fertilizer-making craze throughout the township.

Wherever Tsering Drolma lives, she carries water, sweeps the floor, boils water, and holds children for the family. When villagers get sick, whether day or night, and no matter how far the distance, she helps to invite doctors. Because she can share weal and woe with the masses, people miss her after not seeing her for a few days. Whether they are old or young, everyone likes to confide in her.

    农奴翻身干劲冲天、率领群众建设家园
    共产党员次仁卓玛被评为好干部
    新华社拉萨20日电　西藏桑日县沃卡区藏族女干部、共产党员次仁卓玛，在工作中认真贯彻执行党的政策，关心农民群众的生产和生活，坚持和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，被群众称为“好干部”和“知心人”。
    次仁卓玛在四年前还是一个受尽领主折磨的奴隶。1956年，她挣脱了农奴主的锁链，参加了工作，以后并被送到陕西咸阳的西藏公学学习。在西藏上层反动集团发动的武装叛乱被平息以后，她在去年6月间回到西藏，立即投入了伟大的民主改革运动。在党的培养教育下，她的阶级觉悟和工作能力不断提高，并光荣地参加了中国共产党。她曾经三次受到中共桑日县委和桑日县人民政府的表扬、奖励，最近还被评为先进工作者，出席了西藏全区先进集体和先进生产者代表大会。
    在去年民主改革运动中，次仁卓玛经常以她过去给农奴主当朗生
  （奴隶）的经历，启发引导贫苦农奴和奴隶吐苦水、挖穷根，在党的领导下，当地群众掀起了轰轰烈烈的民主改革运动，摧毁了封建农奴制度的统治。今年2月间，桑日县农民开展备耕生产活动，中共沃卡区委把次仁卓玛调到这里。她一到黑龙乡，就把行李搬到贫苦农奴其美平措的家里，每天和互助组员们一起下田劳动，并且一边劳动一边了解情况，向组员们宣传党的政策。她在和其美央吉互助组组员一起劳动时，了解到这个组贯彻互利原则不够好，她便召开组员大会，充分发扬民主，使互利问题得到了合理解决，加强了组内的团结，使全组的劳动出勤率达到了百分之百，春耕准备工作搞得热火朝天。
    去年冬季，次仁卓玛从歇村到了莫村。她发现这个村的七十多克地（一克地约等于一亩）全在山坡上，没有水浇，群众只忙积肥不修水利。有的农民告诉她：“这里连人吃的水都要到很远的地方去背，种庄稼只能靠天。”次仁卓玛心想：“事在人为。翻身农民在党的领导下，一定能够创造出前人梦想不到的奇迹。”她就向大家说：“沟里的水提不起来，不能把山上的水引下来吗？”为了用事实说服大家，她带领积极分子旦增、明久，爬山越岭探水。他们探索到格阿山上有七条小自然流水沟，虽然水量少，但引下山来还可以灌田。次仁卓玛便根据水源情况，积极帮助群众设计图案，利用格阿山上的泉水和丽机灵山上的雪水浇地。在探清水源的第二天，村里的十八个男女青壮年就冒着严寒修渠，只用十五天时间就在格阿山上修成了一条大水渠，并在丽机灵山脚下筑起拦水坝，使原来白白流往江里的水顺着修好的水渠流到村里。见到地里流来了水，农民都非常兴奋。八十五岁的桑珠格姆说：“几千年不能解决的救命水，现在解决了，我们的子孙后代将永远记住共产党和毛主席的恩情，永远记住党和毛主席派来的好干部。”
    次仁卓玛不但热爱劳动，还十分重视学习生产技术，提高生产效率。在一年多时间中，她就学会了耕地、播种、造细肥和田间管理等生产技术。为了贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，推广新技术，她种了一块试验田，带头学习使用新式步犁，改撒播为条播。当地农民没有施追肥的习惯，她就用典型事例教育农民，并且学习外地的造肥经验，在全乡掀起了造肥热潮。
    次仁卓玛住在谁家里，就给谁家背水、扫地、烧水和抱孩子。村里人得了病，不管是白天或黑夜，也不管有多远的路程，她都帮助去请医生。由于她能和群众同甘共苦，人们几天不见她就想念她，不管老年人或年轻人都喜欢和她谈心。（附图片）
