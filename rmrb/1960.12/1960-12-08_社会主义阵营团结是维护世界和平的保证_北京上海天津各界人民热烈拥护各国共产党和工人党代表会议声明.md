Xinhua News Agency, 7th December:
    The Solidarity of the Socialist Camp is a Guarantee for World Peace
    People from All Walks of Life in Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin Warmly Support the Statement of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of All Countries
    Xinhua News Agency, 7th – Today, many workers, students, and cadres in the capital continued to hold symposiums, warmly supporting the statement of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries, expressing their determination to further strengthen the solidarity of the socialist camp, especially between China and the Soviet Union, and to contribute to the realization of the goals set forth in the statement.
    Wen Guibao, the driver of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship" locomotive group, read the statement before departure. He said: "Imperialism fears the unity of the socialist camp most when pushing its policy of aggression, especially the unity between China and the Soviet Union. Therefore, they always try every means to destroy the close friendship between our two parties and two countries. This meeting statement thoroughly shattered their shameless fantasy. The solidarity between China and the Soviet Union is based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism. No matter what kind of disturbances occur in the world, the people of our two countries will always stand together."
    Yang Shiming, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of the Sino-Soviet Friendship People's Commune in Shijingshan, said: "The fighting tasks outlined in the statement express the wishes of our commune members. Each of us bears a significant responsibility for realizing these tasks." He stated that the members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship People's Commune would protect the great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union like the apple of their eye, and would forever stand with the Soviet people to fight to the end against the imperialist policies of aggression and war, and to safeguard world peace.
    Wang Zhiguo, a national model worker and head of the blast furnace section of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, said at the symposium that the statement pointed out that the strength of socialism is increasingly and obviously surpassing the strength of imperialism, and the forces of peace are increasingly and obviously surpassing the forces of war. This once again proves the correctness of Chairman Mao's thesis that the East wind prevails over the West wind. He said that the publication of the document is only the beginning of a new common struggle, and we are determined to work with the working class of the world to fight for the realization of the goals set forth in the statement. Li Jiude, a representative of the National Heroes' Congress and a miner from Jingxi Coal Mine, said that the statement pointed out that a new world war could be prevented by relying on the joint effort of the socialist camp, the international working class, the national liberation movement, all countries opposed to war, and the combined efforts of all peace-loving forces. He said that in order to achieve this goal and effectively safeguard world peace, it is necessary to concentrate our efforts and aim the spearhead of struggle at the most vicious enemy of the people of the world, U.S. imperialism. Guo Dezhong, a former artillery squad leader of the Volunteer Army who fought against the American aggressors on the Korean battlefield and a worker at the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, said that the statement said that the nature of imperialism will not change, and as long as imperialism exists, there will be soil for wars of aggression. This is absolutely true. All peace-loving people must maintain the greatest vigilance, unite, and resolutely struggle. If U.S. imperialism insists on imposing a new world war on the people, we will resolutely wipe out these pieces of trash from the earth and bury capitalism.
    Du Jinfang, a Peking opera actress from the Chinese Art Troupe who had just returned from performing in Latin America, said: "The Latin American friends we met during this tour, whether they were militia fighters from Cuba, university students from Venezuela, or peace activists from Colombia, all voiced an angry cry: 'No Americanos!' They said: 'Cuba is not just six million people, and Latin America is not just two hundred million people. The Soviet Union, China, the entire socialist camp, and all peace-loving people around the world stand with us. We are more than two billion people!'" Du Jinfang said that the national liberation movement is a great force against imperialism and for safeguarding world peace in modern times. This meeting statement gives high praise and great support to the national liberation movement, which will be a new encouragement to the oppressed people all over the world.
    Zhou Xiquan, Vice Chairman of the Peking University Student Union, said: "This statement is a weapon for the people of all countries who love peace to fight against imperialism and strive for national independence, democratic freedom, and socialism. All the students of Peking University fully support this statement and, under the leadership of the Party, will bravely advance along the fighting goals pointed out in the statement."
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th December: People from all walks of life in Shanghai warmly support the statement of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries, believing that this statement will play a significant role in mobilizing all the communists and all peace-loving people in the world, and encourage them to take further action to defend world peace, strive for national liberation, democratic freedom, and achieve socialism.
    Today, all newspapers in Shanghai published the full text of the statement. Newspapers sold at post offices, newspaper and magazine shops, newspaper vendors, and street newsstands in various districts were sold out in just over an hour. Many units constantly called the newspaper distribution departments, requesting an increase in circulation.
    Workers in many factories such as Jiangnan Shipyard, Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, and National Cotton Factory No. 2 all took advantage of rest time to carefully read the statement and hold discussions. Wu Xiankang, the leader of the Wu Xiankang group, a national advanced collective at Jiangnan Shipyard, said that after reading this statement, one feels more and more that the strength of the socialist camp is growing stronger and stronger, and the world socialist system is becoming a decisive factor in the development of human society. The statement points out that U.S. imperialism is an international gendarme and the enemy of the people of the world. We must wage unremitting struggles against U.S. imperialism and support the anti-colonial struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Yi Shijuan, an advanced producer at National Cotton Factory No. 2, and Jin Xingtao, a newly promoted worker engineer at Shanghai Automotive Electric Motor Factory, said at the symposium that the statement calls on all socialist countries to protect the solidarity of the socialist camp as they would protect the apple of their eye. This is very important. Imperialists and reactionaries attempt to undermine the friendship and solidarity between the socialist countries, especially between the people of China and the Soviet Union. This statement completely shatters their illusions, and their conspiracy will never succeed.
    The heads of various Shanghai people's organizations unanimously believe that this statement, like the Moscow Declaration issued in 1957, is a guideline for the common actions and a program for strengthening unity for the communists and the working class of all countries, as well as all peace-loving people. Zhong Min, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, said that the statement is of great significance for further strengthening the unity of the socialist camp's big family and for further promoting the development of the international communist movement. He expressed that the workers of Shanghai, together with the people of the country, will firmly and closely unite around the great Communist Party of China, hold high the revolutionary banner of Marxism-Leninism, strengthen solidarity with the working classes of all countries, take joint action and strengthen struggles against imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, and for the liberation of the working class and the cause of all mankind. Guo Jian, Director of the Shanghai Women's Federation, said that this statement will play a huge mobilizing role for women, inspiring their determination and confidence in defending peace. Li Qitao, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, said that the statement pointed out that after the establishment of the socialist system, capitalist remnants will remain in people's minds for a long period of time. This correct thesis is of particularly important significance for the cause of cultivating a new generation of communists. Imperialism, reactionaries, and revisionists are trying every means to spread bourgeois ideological poisons to poison the youth, attempting to carry out a "peaceful evolution" within socialist countries. We must unremittingly strengthen socialist and communist education, and educate the youth to make the most thorough break with all kinds of bourgeois ideas in all fields.
    Jin Zhonghua, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, said: We can clearly see from this statement that the current situation is unprecedentedly favorable for the struggle of the people all over the world to defend world peace, and a new world war can be prevented. However, we must awaken the people to constantly raise their vigilance and resolutely oppose the imperialist policies of aggression and war headed by U.S. imperialism in order to effectively prevent the outbreak of a new world war.
    Zhao Zukang, Liu Jingji, Lu Yudao, Zhou Gucheng, Wu Ruoan, Liao Shicheng and other heads of the Shanghai local organizations of various democratic parties pointed out that the statement of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries is the program for the current struggle of the people of the world to unite and resolutely oppose the imperialist policies of aggression and war and safeguard world peace. They expressed their firm support for this statement.
    Teachers and students of various universities and colleges in Shanghai also held discussions. Shen Guorong, Chairman of the East China Normal University Student Union, said: We fully support the statement that the aggressive nature of imperialism has not changed. Only by persisting in the struggle against imperialism and exposing their war conspiracies can we defend world peace. Qi Qisheng, a professor of the Department of Economics at Fudan University, said that the statement correctly pointed out that the world capitalist system is in a state of profound decline and disintegration, and that U.S. imperialism has become the largest world exploiter and the main fortress of world reactionary forces. However, no matter how it supports the decaying foundation of capitalism, the result can only be to make its internal and external contradictions more acute and worsen, and it will never be able to stop the wheels of history from advancing.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 7th December: People from all walks of life in Tianjin warmly support the statement of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries, expressing that they will work with the people of the world to support and realize the goals of the struggle outlined in the statement with practical actions.
    When the newspapers carrying this statement were delivered to factories and enterprises in Tianjin, workers scrambled to read them. Many factories, such as the No. 2 Steel Plant, the No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory, the Bicycle Factory, the Refractory Materials Factory, and the No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, also used radio broadcasts and blackboards to widely publicize the statement to their employees, so that every shift and every person could understand the content of the statement in a timely manner. After reading the statement, the employees held discussions one after another. At the symposium held by the workers of the No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory, Zhu Wujing, a Tianjin model worker, said: This statement shows that the solidarity of the socialist camp and the solidarity of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries in the world have been further strengthened. This rock-solid unity is the fundamental guarantee for preventing imperialist wars of aggression and maintaining world peace. At the symposium held by the Lu Shan Youth Shock Brigade of the Sixth Construction Company, Lu Shan, the leader of this team, and others pointed out: The solidarity between China and the Soviet Union, two great socialist countries, and the solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, are the powerful pillars for maintaining world peace. We will work with the working class of the country, as in the past, to resolutely safeguard the eternal and unbreakable friendship and unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union, and further strengthen the strength of the socialist camp.
    Members of many urban people's communes, such as Gansu Road, Guozhuangzi, and Xing'an Road, also held discussions one after another, expressing their warm support for this statement. Twenty-five units, including the factories and service stations under the Gansu Road People's Commune, held symposiums separately. Wu Guodong, the Party Branch Secretary of the hardware factory of this commune, said: This statement exposes the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to undermine world peace, and points out that U.S. imperialism is the main fortress of world reactionary forces, the international gendarme, and the enemy of the people of the world. This will be of extremely important significance for the anti-imperialist struggle currently being carried out by the people of all countries. National "March 8th" Red Banner holders and provincial and municipal advanced workers of the Xing'an Road People's Commune held a symposium. Famous advanced workers such as Xu Guilan, Zhou Wenjuan, and Pang Xiuzhu expressed at the meeting that they would resolutely respond to the call of the statement and contribute their strength to opposing the imperialist policies of aggression and maintaining world peace.
    Teachers and students of universities and colleges such as Tianjin University, Nankai University, and Hebei University also repeatedly read the statement and held discussions. Zhang Guofan, President of Tianjin University, said that this statement is a great document for safeguarding world peace, realizing national liberation and democratic freedom, and promoting the rapid development of socialism throughout the world. It is a serious blow to the war conspiracy of U.S. imperialism.
    Members of the Tianjin local organizations of various democratic parties also expressed their warm support for this statement.

    社会主义阵营团结是维护世界和平的保证
    北京上海天津各界人民热烈拥护各国共产党和工人党代表会议声明
    新华社7日讯　首都许多工人、学生、机关干部今天继续举行座谈会，热烈拥护各国共产党工人党代表会议声明，表示要进一步加强社会主义阵营尤其是中苏两国的团结，并且为实现声明所规定的目标贡献自己的力量。
    中苏友好号机车组司机温贵宝在发车前阅读了声明。他说：帝国主义要推行侵略政策，最怕社会主义阵营的团结，尤其是中苏两国的团结，所以他们总是千方百计妄想破坏我们两党两国间的亲密友谊。这次会议声明彻底粉碎了他们的无耻妄想。中苏团结，是建立在马克思列宁主义思想原则基础上的，不论世界上会发生什么样的风波，我们两国人民将永远站在一起。
    石景山中苏友好公社党委副书记杨世明说：声明中所规定的各项战斗任务，都道出了我们社员的心意。为了实现这些任务，我们每一个人都肩负着重大责任。他表示，中苏友好人民公社的社员，将像保护眼珠一样，保卫中苏两国人民的伟大友谊，永远和苏联人民一起，为反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，维护世界和平而奋斗到底。
    全国劳动模范、石景山钢铁公司化铁炉工段长王治国在座谈会上说，这个声明指出社会主义力量日益明显地超过帝国主义的力量，和平力量日益明显地超过战争力量，这再一次证明了毛主席关于东风压倒西风的论断的正确。他说，文件的公布只是新的共同斗争的开始，我们决心同全世界工人阶级一起，为实现声明中规定的目标而斗争。全国群英会代表、京西煤矿矿工李九德说，声明指出，依靠社会主义阵营、国际工人阶级、民族解放运动、所有反对战争的国家以及一切爱好和平力量的联合努力，新的世界战争是能够防止的。他说，为了达到这个目的，切实维护世界和平，必须集中力量，把斗争锋芒对准全世界人民最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义。曾经在朝鲜战场上同美国侵略军较量过的前志愿军炮兵班长、北京第一机床厂工人郭德仲说，声明说帝国主义的本性不会改变，只要帝国主义还存在，就有侵略战争的土壤，这话千真万确。一切爱好和平的人民，必须保持最大的警惕，团结起来，坚决斗争。如果美帝国主义硬要把新的世界大战强加在人民的头上，我们就坚决把人类中的这些垃圾从地球上扫除干净，把资本主义埋葬掉。
    刚刚结束在拉丁美洲等地演出归来的中国艺术团京剧演员杜近芳说：这次访问演出中接触到的拉丁美洲朋友，无论是古巴的民兵战士，委内瑞拉的大学生，或者是哥伦比亚的和平人士，他们都发出了一个愤怒的声音：“不要美国佬！”他们说：“古巴不是六百万人，拉丁美洲也不是两亿人，苏联、中国、整个社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平的人民都同我们站在一起、我们有二十多亿人！”杜近芳说，民族解放运动是当代反对帝国主义和维护世界和平的伟大力量，这次会议声明对于民族解放运动给以很高评价和极大支持，这对于全世界被压迫人民将是一个新的鼓舞。
    北京大学学生会副主席周希权说：这个声明是世界各国爱好和平人民反对帝国主义，争取民族独立、民主自由和社会主义的斗争武器。我们北京大学全体学生，全力支持这个声明，并在党的领导下，沿着声明所指引的斗争目标奋勇前进。
    据新华社上海7日电　上海市各界人民热烈拥护和支持各国共产党和工人党代表会议声明，认为这个声明对于全世界共产党人和一切爱好和平的人民将发挥重大的动员作用，鼓舞他们进一步行动起来，为保卫世界和平，争取民族解放、民主自由和实现社会主义而进行坚决的斗争。
    今天，上海各报都刊登了声明的全文。各区邮局、报刊门市部、售报员和街头书报摊上出售的报纸，一个多小时内就销售一空，很多单位不断打电话给报刊发行部门，要求增加发行量。
  江南造船厂、上钢三厂、国棉二厂等许多工厂的工人，都利用休息时间认真阅读声明并进行座谈。江南造船厂全国先进集体邬显康小组组长邬显康说，读了这个声明以后，愈使人感到社会主义阵营的力量越来越强大，世界社会主义体系正在成为人类社会发展的决定因素。声明指出美帝国主义是国际宪兵，全世界人民的敌人。我们要进行不懈的斗争，反对美帝国主义、支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的反殖民主义斗争。国棉二厂先进生产者裔式娟、上海汽车电机厂新提拔的工人工程师金兴涛等人在座谈会上说，声明中号召所有社会主义国家像保护眼珠一样，保护社会主义阵营的团结。这是很重要的。帝国主义者和反动派妄图破坏社会主义各国特别是中苏两国人民的友谊和团结，这个声明彻底粉碎它们的妄想，它们这种阴谋是永远不会得逞的。
    上海各人民团体的负责人一致认为，这个声明同1957年发表的莫斯科宣言一样，是各国共产党人和工人阶级以及一切爱好和平的人民今后共同行动的准则和加强团结的纲领。上海市总工会主席钟民说，声明对于进一步加强社会主义阵营大家庭的团结，对于进一步促进国际共产主义运动的发展，具有重大意义。他表示，上海工人和全国人民一起，坚决紧密地团结在伟大的中国共产党的周围，更高地举起马克思列宁主义的革命大旗，加强同各国工人阶级的团结，为反对帝国主义特别是美帝国主义，为实现工人阶级和全人类的解放事业，共同行动，加强斗争。上海市妇女联合会主任郭建说，这个声明对妇女们将发挥巨大的动员作用，鼓舞她们保卫和平的决心和信心。共青团上海市委书记李琦涛说，声明指出在社会主义制度建立以后，在一个长时期内，人们意识中还会有资本主义的残余。这个正确的论点对于培养共产主义新一代的事业，具有特别重要的意义。帝国主义、反动派和修正主义正在千方百计地散播资产阶级思想毒素来毒害青年，企图在社会主义国家内部来一个“和平演变”。我们一定要不懈地加强社会主义、共产主义教育，教育青年在一切领域中同形形色色的资产阶级思想作最彻底的决裂。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会上海市分会主席金仲华说：我们从这个声明中可以清楚地看到，当前形势对于全世界人民保卫世界和平的斗争空前有利，新的世界战争是可以防止的，但是，必须唤起人民不断地提高警惕，坚决反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策，才能有效地防止新的世界战争的爆发。
    各民主党派上海地方组织的负责人赵祖康、刘靖基、鲁于道、周谷城、吴若安、廖世承等人指出，各国共产党和工人党代表会议声明，是当前世界人民团结起来坚决反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策、维护世界和平的斗争纲领。他们表示坚决拥护和支持这个声明。
    上海各高等院校的师生也纷纷举行座谈会。华东师范大学学生会主席沈国荣说，我们完全拥护声明指出的帝国主义的侵略本性没有改变的论点。只有坚持不懈地同帝国主义进行斗争，揭露它们的战争阴谋，才能保卫世界和平。复旦大学经济系教授漆琪生说，声明正确地指出世界资本主义体系正处在深刻的衰落和瓦解过程中，美帝国主义成了最大的世界剥削者，而且是世界反动势力的主要堡垒。但是，不管它怎样支撑资本主义的腐朽基础，其结果只能是愈使它的内部矛盾和外部矛盾更加尖锐化和恶化，绝不能阻挡历史的车轮前进。
    据新华社天津7日电　天津市各界人民热烈拥护各国共产党和工人党代表会议声明，表示将同全世界人民一起，以实际行动支持和实现声明中所规定的斗争目标。
    当刊载这个声明的报纸送到天津各工厂企业时，工人们争相阅读，第二钢厂、第三棉纺织厂、自行车厂、耐火器材厂、第一机床厂等许多工厂还通过广播、黑板报等，向职工进行了广泛的宣传，使班班、人人都及时了解了声明的内容。职工们在读了声明以后，纷纷进行座谈。第三棉纺织厂的工人们举行的座谈会上，天津市劳动模范祝五经说：这个声明表明，社会主义阵营的团结和全世界各国共产党和工人党的团结进一步增强了。这种坚如磐石的团结，是制止帝国主义侵略战争，维护世界和平的根本保证。在第六建筑公司卢珊青年突击队举行的座谈会上，这个队队长卢珊等人指出：中国和苏联两个伟大社会主义国家的团结，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，是维护世界和平的强大支柱。我们将和全国工人阶级一道，像过去一样，坚决维护中苏两国人民永恒的、牢不可破的友谊和团结，进一步加强社会主义阵营的力量。
    甘肃路、郭庄子、兴安路等许多城市人民公社的社员，也纷纷举行座谈，表示热烈拥护和支持这个声明。甘肃路人民公社所属工厂、服务站等二十五个单位分别举行了座谈会。这个公社五金厂党支部书记吴国栋说：这个声明揭露了美帝国主义破坏世界和平的阴谋，指出美帝国主义是世界反动势力的主要堡垒，是国际宪兵，是全世界人民的敌人。这对于当前各国人民正在进行的反帝斗争，将有极为重要的意义。兴安路人民公社的全国“三八”红旗手和省、市先进工作者举行了座谈会，著名的先进工作者许贵兰、周文娟、庞秀珠等在会上表示坚决响应声明的号召，为反对帝国主义的侵略政策、维护世界和平，贡献出自己的力量。
    天津大学、南开大学、河北大学等高等院校的师生，也反复阅读声明并举行座谈。天津大学校长张国藩说，这个声明是保卫世界和平、实现民族解放和民主自由、促进社会主义在全世界迅速发展的伟大文献，是对美帝国主义战争阴谋的一个严重打击。
    各民主党派天津市地方组织的成员也表示热烈拥护这个声明。（附图片）
