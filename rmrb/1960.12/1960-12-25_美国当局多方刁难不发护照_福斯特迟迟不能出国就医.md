Xinhua News Agency, December 24th, New York Dispatch: Due to various obstructions by the U.S. authorities, the honorary chairman of the Communist Party of the United States, Foster, has been unable to obtain the passport necessary for seeking medical treatment abroad.

Earlier, under the demand of righteous public opinion, the U.S. Supreme Court had to approve the seriously ill Foster to go to the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia for medical treatment.

The General Secretary of the Communist Party of the United States, Hall, issued a statement to the press regarding the authorities' repeated delays in issuing the passport, saying that the State Department's Passport Office initially shuffled the matter around, passing it from one person to another. Now, the State Department has even transferred the handling of Foster's passport application to officials in charge of "security affairs." Hall emphasized that this is a continued barbaric persecution by the U.S. authorities against Foster, who urgently needs to receive treatment and care.

    美国当局多方刁难不发护照
    福斯特迟迟不能出国就医
    新华社24日讯　纽约消息：由于美国当局多方刁难，美国共产党名誉主席福斯特迟迟不能获得为出国治病所需的护照。
    早些时候，美国最高法院在正义的舆论要求下面，不得不批准身患重病的福斯特去苏联和捷克斯洛伐克就医。
    美国共产党总书记霍尔就当局一再拖延颁发护照向报界发表谈话说，国务院护照科最初把这件事推来推去，让它从一个人手中转到另一个人手中。现在，国务院甚至把办理福斯特出国护照的事转交给负责“安全事务”的官员去处理。霍尔强调指出，这是美国当局对急需获得治疗和护理的福斯特继续进行的野蛮迫害。
