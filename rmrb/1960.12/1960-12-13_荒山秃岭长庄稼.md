　　Crops Grow on Barren Hills
　　By our reporter Jiang Heyuan
　　In the early winter evening, snowflakes fluttered, and from the dining hall of the public canteen, a loud and impassioned song was heard: "Chairman Mao is like the sun, shining on Gashijiano, phoenixes emerge from barren hills, and the commune members are overjoyed...". Gashijiano is a new village with only twelve households and thirty-three commune members.
　　It is located deep in the Kari Gang Mountains, which stretch for dozens of kilometers, and is a small team of the Shalianbao Production Team of the Dehenglong Commune in the Hualong Hui Autonomous County of Qinghai Province. Who would have imagined that this village, filled with the joy of harvest, was a barren and uninhabited place just over a year ago! Whenever people talk about the changes in Gashijiano, they all give a thumbs up to the heroes who developed Gashijiano, praising their determination to become stronger and their firm revolutionary will to dare to struggle and dare to win.
　　Exploring the Barren Mountains Alone
　　One morning in the spring of 1959, a farmer in his forties rode a black horse, braving the biting mountain wind, and traveled over mountains and ridges to Gashijiano. He hobbled the horse and grabbed a handful of the just-thawed black soil, looked at it, rubbed it, smelled it, and a smile appeared on his face. He ran down the gully, walking towards the faint sound, staring at the slow-flowing spring water with a smile. He climbed a small hill, looked around at the land dotted with new buds of grass on the surrounding slopes, and was happy from the bottom of his heart. He said to himself: "What good land this is!". In the evening, he appeared in the production team's office. When the commune party secretary Chen Hu and the production team branch secretary Ma Muhua saw him, they almost simultaneously asked: "Ma Chengyun, how is Gashijiano?" "It's a good place to grow crops!" Ma Chengyun replied. It turned out that a few days ago, Chen Hu and Ma Muhua had been to Gashijiano and were very interested in the barren hills there. They did some calculations: if Gashijiano could be reclaimed, the Shalianbao Production Team could increase its cultivated land by 1,000 to 2,000 mu, opening up a new grain production base. However, who would develop it? How to develop it? They approached Ma Chengyun, the leader of the fourth team's work group, and asked him to take a look at Gashijiano first... "How about giving you the task of reclaiming Gashijiano?" "If you two secretaries can make up your minds, I can accept the task!" Ma Chengyun said firmly. After accepting the task, Ma Chengyun further realized the arduousness of the task. "The wasteland cannot be opened up by one person, and the land cannot be planted by one person. Can I lead the commune members well?" That night, he first told his sixty-year-old mother about it. This was an old woman who had lived in hardship for most of her life and only began to enjoy a happy life after liberation. Her two sons were a deputy party branch secretary and a work group leader. From her own life experience, she believed in the Party's wisdom and correctness. The Party entrusted her son with the task of reclaiming wasteland, and she felt honored. Therefore, she firmly said to her son: "With the leadership of the Party, you can lead the commune members well. Listen to the Party and go ahead, Gashijiano is a good place to grow crops!"
　　Four Brave Generals Conquer the Land
　　The next day, Ma Chengyun invited his good friend Ma Hailu, and with a yak hair tent, a felt blanket, and some dry food, came to Gashijiano. As soon as the tent was set up, it got dark. The mountain wind became more and more fierce. They ate some dry food, lay on the hay, and started talking. They talked about the present of Gashijiano and also its future. Ma Chengyun became more and more excited as he talked, and casually asked Ma Hailu: "Are you willing to live here long term?" "As long as the production team agrees, we'll do it together!" The next morning, Ma Chengyun sent Ma Hailu back to the production team to report the situation, and to bring a pot and grain. He started building a stove with stones. At this time, Chen Hu and Ma Muhua came, inquiring about Ma Chengyun's difficulties with concern, and informed him that in addition to leaving Ma Hailu, they had decided to send two Communist Youth League members—the demobilized soldier Ye Chengzhang and Ma Sofia, the female cook from the fifth team. At this time, discussions started in the village. Some old people even advised the cadres to think carefully. Old Han Muhang said to Ma Muhua: "Gashijiano is a vast mountain range, with no blockage from any direction. Even if you build two houses, they will be blown away by the wind!" While people were talking, the four people on Gashijiano Mountain were holding their first meeting. This was on the evening of the fourth day. They unanimously passed a resolution: to take root, blossom, and bear fruit in Gashijiano! Everyone also divided up the work. As the drums of conquering Gashijiano sounded, difficulties followed one after another. In May, the Kari Gang area was continuously rainy, and the tent dripped small drops of rain, making it impossible to find a dry place. What was worse was that the firewood was all wet, making it impossible to cook. Under these circumstances, they had to mobilize everyone to cook one meal a day. Some kneaded the dough, some pumped the sheepskin bellows. The smoke in the tent choked people, making them cough and tear up. It took one or two hours to cook a meal. This was a test of people! But it didn't break them down. The rainy May tempered these four people to be even stronger. They used all the time they could to reclaim wasteland, accumulate fertilizer, and build livestock pens. A month later, they had opened up 26 mu of wasteland, accumulated more than 40,000 jin of fertilizer, and built two livestock pens. The land was conquered, but people were still living in yak hair tents...

　　Overcoming Difficulties and Establishing a Foothold
　　The land was conquered, and the number of people increased to eleven. By November, they had opened up more than 400 mu of land. In order to plant all these lands and increase grain production, they had to fight more complex and arduous struggles with nature and the land. Although they had accumulated some human and animal manure, it was far from meeting their needs. What to do? Burning ash fertilizer is an important measure to ensure increased production in mountainous areas, which can not only supply nutrients for crop growth, but also increase soil temperature. However, according to the previous method of burning ash, a pile of ash could only be applied to one mu of land, requiring one hundred jin of firewood. Where to find so much fuel? Ma Chengyun and the commune members decided to break with convention and save fuel by burning large piles of ash. They did what they said, and using the terrain, they set up more than 30 fire pits on a hillside with a slope of more than 40 degrees, occupying an area of 2.5 mu. The firewood was lit, and the fire burned stronger and stronger with the northwest wind. People hurried to add sod and soil blocks on the hillside. The sod and soil blocks rolled down from above, which was not very laborious. They filled it for four days and four nights, raising the ground by 3.5 chi, and smoldered it for 15 days. During these days, although the mountainous area was already covered with ice and snow, a few of them took turns working. This time, they burned and smoked 1.5 million jin of ash fertilizer. The crops were planted and grew very well. However, there were countless blind mice and *hala* (likely referring to some local rodent) in the barren mountains that came out to eat the crops. They had no choice but to protect them day and night. Young and strong commune members patrolled the mountains day and night in shifts. Older commune members carried cans of rat poison made of antu and walked around the surrounding mountain valleys and ravines, placing poisoned bait in each rat hole to poison and kill harmful rats and protect the crops. While one struggle was still going on, another struggle came. The wheat and highland barley on the newly cultivated land grew particularly tall due to the abundance of manure and fertile soil, and began to lodge as soon as they headed. Seeing the crops falling in pieces, the commune members mobilized to apply grass ash to the fields, and at the same time cut *malien* (likely some kind of local grass), twisted straw ropes, and propped up and tied all the fallen crops. The wind was strong in the high mountains, and the crops that had just been propped up fell again in a gust of wind. They propped them up again and again, expending a lot of effort to ensure that the crops matured.

　　Phoenixes Emerge from Barren Hills
　　After more than a year of hard struggle, golden phoenixes flew out of Gashijiano, this barren and uninhabited place. This year, 410 mu of grain crops were planted here, producing more than 100,100 jin of wheat, highland barley, and beans, averaging more than 3,760 jin per person. In addition to selling public grain and keeping enough seeds, rations, and feed, there was also a portion of reserve grain; here, 61 head of draft animals and more than 170 sheep were raised, as well as many pigs, chickens, and rabbits; here, the first batch of poplar and willow trees were planted, and the barren hills will be covered with greenery; here, more than 70 houses, as well as grain warehouses and public canteens, were built, forming a new residential area; here, there are already 12 households and 33 commune members, becoming a new team of the Shalianbao Production Team!

    荒山秃岭长庄稼
  　本报记者　江河沅
    初冬的傍晚，雪花纷飞，从公共食堂的餐厅里，传出了一阵高吭激昂的歌声：毛主席像太阳，光芒照在尕什加诺，荒山秃岭出凤凰，社员们喜洋洋……。尕什加诺，是一座只有十二户、三十三名社员的新村庄。
    这里位于绵延几十公里的卡日岗山的深处，是青海省化隆回族自治县德恒隆公社沙连堡生产队的一个小队。谁想像得到这个洋溢丰收的喜悦的村庄，在一年多以前竟是一个荒山秃岭、渺无人烟的地方！人们一谈起尕什加诺的变化，无不翘起大姆指赞誉开发尕什加诺的英雄们，称赞他们那股发愤图强和敢于斗争、敢于胜利的坚定的革命意志。
    单人匹马探荒山
    1959年春天的一个早晨，一个四十多岁的农民骑着一匹黑马，迎着凛冽刺骨的山风，翻山越岭来到尕什加诺。他绊住马，就地抓起一把刚刚解冻的黑土，瞧瞧、揉揉、闻闻，脸上涌现出笑容。他跑下山沟，迎着轻微的响声走去，眼盯着一般缓缓的泉水微笑。他爬上一个小山峰，环视周围山坡上点缀着草儿新芽的土地打心眼里高兴，他自言自语：“多么好的土地啊！”。傍晚他出现在生产队的办公室里。公社党委书记陈琥、生产队支部书记马木华看到他，几乎同时问道：“马成云，尕什加诺怎样？”“是种庄稼的好地方！”马成云回答。原来在几天以前，陈琥和马木华曾经到过尕什加诺一趟，对这里的荒山秃岭很感兴趣。他们算了一笔账：如果把尕什加诺开垦出来，沙连堡生产队就可以增加一、二千亩耕地，开辟一个新的粮食生产基地。然而，由谁来开发？怎么开发？他们找上了第四小队作业组长马成云，请他先到尕什加诺看看……“把尕什加诺开荒任务交给你怎样？”“你们两位书记能下决心，我就能接受任务！”马成云说的很坚定。任务接受下来以后，马成云才进一步意识到任务的艰巨。“荒不能一个人开，地不能一个人种，我能领导好社员吗？”当天晚上，他先把这事告诉了自己的六十多岁的母亲。这是一个在苦难中生活了大半辈子的老太太，解放后才过上幸福的日子，她的两个儿子，一个是党支部副书记、一个是作业组长，她从自己的生活体验中相信党的英明正确。党把开荒任务交给自己的儿子，她感到光荣，因此坚定地对儿子说：“有党的领导，你就能带好社员，听党的话，去吧，尕什加诺是个长庄稼的好地方！”
    四员虎将闯江山
    第二天，马成云约了自己的好朋友马海禄，带着一顶牛毛帐篷、一条毡和一些干粮，来到了尕什加诺。刚支好帐房，天就黑了。山风越刮越猛烈。他俩吃了点干粮，躺在干草上就谈开了。他们谈尕什加诺的现在，也谈它的将来。马成云越谈越兴奋，顺口问马海禄：“长期住下来愿意吗？”“只要生产队同意，我们就一起干吧！”第三天早晨，马成云打发马海禄回生产队去汇报情况，并带一口锅和粮食来，自己就动手找石头搭炉灶。这时陈琥和马木华来了，关心地询问马成云有没有困难，并通知他除了把马海禄留下来外还确定派来两个共青团员——复员军人冶成章和第五小队的女炊事员马索菲亚。这时，村子里议论开了，有些老年人甚至劝干部要好好思谋。韩木罕老汉对马木华说：“尕什加诺空山大岭，东西南北风都没堵挡，盖上两间房子也要被风刮走的！”当人们议论纷纷的时候，尕什加诺山上的四个人正在举行第一次会议。这是第四天晚上的事情。他们一致通过一个决议：在尕什加诺扎根、开花、结果！大家还分了工。征服尕什加诺的锣鼓刚打响，困难也接踵而来。5月份，卡日岗山区阴雨连绵，帐篷里也滴滴嗒嗒下起小雨来，简直找不到一块干地方。更糟糕的是柴火都弄湿了，做不成饭。在这种情况下，他们只好每天总动员做一顿饭，和面的和面，打羊皮风箱的打羊皮风箱，帐篷里的烟呛的人们咳嗽、流泪，做一顿饭得花一两个钟头。这是考验人的时候啊！但是并没有考验垮他们。阴雨连绵的五月，把这四个人锻炼得更加坚强了。他们利用一切可以利用的时间，开荒、积肥、修畜圈。一个月以后，就开了二十六亩荒地，积攒了四万多斤肥料，修了两个畜圈。江山闯开了，可是人还是住在牛毛帐篷里……
    战胜困难立定脚跟
    江山闯开了，人也增加到十一个，到11月，他们已经开辟了四百多亩地。为了把这些地全部种上，增产粮食，还得与天、与地作更复杂更艰巨的斗争。他们虽然积攒了一些人、畜粪，还是远远满足不了需要。怎么办？烧灰肥，这是保证山区增产的重大措施，不仅可以供给作物生长的养分，而且可以提高地温。但是，按照以前烧灰的办法，一堆灰只能上一亩地，得用一百斤柴草。到那里去找这么多的燃料呢？马成云和社员们一合计，决定突破常规，节省燃料烧大堆灰。说干就干，他们利用地形在一片倾斜四十多度的山坡上摆下了三十多个火眼，足足占了二亩五分地的面积。柴草点着了，火借着西北风越烧越旺，人们赶着在山坡上面添草皮、土块，草皮和土块从上面滚下来，并不很费劲，整整添了四天四夜，把地面填高了三尺五寸，熏烧了十五天。在这些日子里，尽管山区已经是冰天雪地，他们几个人还是轮流着干。这次烧灰，熏制了一百五十万斤灰肥。庄稼种上了，而且长得很好。可是，荒山里有数不胜数的瞎老鼠、哈拉出来吃庄稼。他们又不得不昼夜防护。年青力壮的社员，白天黑夜分班在山岭巡逻，年纪较大的社员，提着一罐罐用安妥制成的毒鼠药，走遍周围的山塆、间壑，一个鼠洞、一个鼠洞地放置毒饵，毒杀害鼠，保护庄稼。一场斗争还在进行，另一场斗争又来了。新垦地上的小麦、青稞，由于粪多土肥，长得特别高，刚刚抽穗就开始倒伏。眼看着成片庄稼倒下去，社员们总动员往地里追施草木灰，同时割马莲、搓草绳，把倒下去的庄稼统统扶起来捆扎好。山高风大，刚扶起来的庄稼，一阵风又倒下去了。他们扶了一次再一次，费了很大精力，才保证了庄稼成熟。
    荒山秃岭出凤凰
    经过一年多含辛茹苦的斗争，尕什加诺，这个荒山秃岭、渺无人烟的地方，飞出了金色的凤凰。这里，今年播种了四百一十亩粮食作物，生产了十万零一千多斤小麦、青稞和豆类，平均每人生产三千七百六十多斤，除了交售公购粮和留足种子、口粮、饲料外，还有一部分储备粮；这里，饲养了六十一头耕畜、一百七十多只羊，还有许多猪、鸡、兔；这里，栽种了第一批白杨、柳树，荒山秃岭将披上绿装；这里，盖起了七十多间房子，以及粮食仓库、公共食堂，形成一个新的居民点；这里，已经拥有十二户、三十三个社员，成为沙连堡生产队的一个新的小队！
