Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, December 22nd. As Anshan Iron and Steel Company workers complete this year's plan, they are pushing the rapid steelmaking movement to a new climax. In the first half of December, the smelting time for each furnace of steel was shortened by another ten to twenty minutes compared to the average for the entire month of November, and the daily steel output increased by 4.9% compared to the average for the entire month of November.

Every day as soon as the steelworkers came to work, they would compete to see the competition indicators for each open-hearth furnace announced by the factory. If they found that someone's smelting time was short and they produced more steel, they would immediately try to catch up, and wherever there was advanced experience, they would go to learn from it. The No. 1 Steelmaking Plant fell behind its brother plants in the November competition. The secretary of the plant's Party committee personally led a team to the No. 2 and No. 3 Steelmaking Plants to learn from the experience of accelerating the turnover of large ladles. They launched a campaign to produce six furnaces of steel, pour six furnaces of molten iron, and remove six trucks of waste per shift, and to operate without accidents. This greatly shortened the steelmaking time, enabling the production level in December to rise rapidly, making it the best unit. The secretary of the Party committee of the No. 3 Steelmaking Plant immediately led relevant personnel to the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant to study. They immediately applied what they had learned, enabling each open-hearth furnace to achieve rapid steelmaking one after another, with high yields every day, and finally won the competition banner.

In the rapid steelmaking movement, workers of all trades serving steelmaking fully demonstrated the spirit of communist cooperation. The raw material workers of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant, in order to supply more raw materials to the open-hearth furnaces in a timely manner and to make the raw material mix more accurate, adopted the method of dividing and assigning responsibility to control the composition ratio of ore and scrap steel, so that the qualification rate of raw materials increased by 10% compared to the end of November. As the steelmaking time continued to shorten in the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant, more and more steel ladles and slag ladles were needed. In order to accelerate the turnover of large ladles, the ladle repair workers put forward the slogan of "Rather sweat more ourselves than delay the open-hearth furnace for a minute." Without waiting for the steel ladles and slag ladles to cool down, they repaired the damaged parts of the ladles bit by bit, so that the number of large ladle turnovers increased from eighteen to twenty-seven, thirty, and thirty-two, constantly meeting the needs of rapid open-hearth steelmaking.

While steelworkers at various steelmaking plants were racing against time to increase steel production, they were always paying attention to maintaining the furnace bodies. Each plant has drawn experienced old workers, technicians, and leading cadres to form furnace protection inspection teams, and steelworkers have also launched furnace protection competitions, with dedicated personnel responsible for each part. As a result, the furnace bodies have become stronger and stronger, the furnace repair time has been greatly reduced, and the production time has been greatly increased. Taking the No. 3 Steelmaking Plant as an example, the effective operating rate of open-hearth furnaces in the first half of December increased by 5% compared to November, effectively ensuring the healthy development of the rapid steelmaking movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 22nd. Wuhan Iron and Steel Company's steelworkers launched a rapid steelmaking competition, and steel production continued to rise. In the first ten days of December, the average daily steel production level increased by 14% compared to November, and in the middle ten days, it increased by another 14.5% compared to the first ten days.

Strengthening planning management and vigorously implementing measures are the guarantees for the continuous growth of steelmaking production. Several deputy managers of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company went deep into the steelmaking plants and took turns on duty day and night to vigorously implement work plans and measures, and quickly discovered and solved problems in production. After the steel production increased, the demand for ore raw materials increased greatly. The company immediately organized the mines and transportation departments to increase the volume and storage of open-hearth lump ore. The Raw Materials and Fuel Department, in addition to sending special personnel to organize the source of goods, also organized its own forces to recover old magnesia bricks and process them into magnesia sand to meet the large demand for magnesia used in repairing the furnaces. In order to supply more and faster calcined dolomite needed for steelmaking, workers at the refractory materials plant built two calcining kilns within five days.

In order to ensure the safe operation of equipment and ensure the smooth progress of the rapid steelmaking competition, the steelmaking plant recently also launched a safe and accident-free movement. In addition to mobilizing operators to strengthen equipment maintenance and repair, it also organized a special force to stand guard and patrol for inspections and repairs. The No. 1 branch of the Open-hearth Furnace, in response to the fact that the open-hearth furnace was about to enter the overhaul period and the furnace roof was relatively weak, adopted eight major measures such as appropriately reducing gas, avoiding excessively high or low temperatures, and strengthening the blowing and inspection of the furnace roof, and worked hard to maintain the furnace roof. Since the implementation, the furnace roof has been blown very clean and maintained very well.

Under the unified leadership of the Party committee of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, the workers of various affiliated and auxiliary units of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company took the initiative to serve the main factories and mines, worked together to increase steel production, and made remarkable achievements. The workers of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Power Plant, who have always been at the forefront of the cooperation competition, have proactively helped to inspect and eliminate hundreds of defects and hidden dangers in power equipment in the past month. According to the urgent needs of these factories, they have rushed to manufacture and send more than 200 types and more than 5,000 pieces of electrical spare parts, ensuring that the water, electricity, wind, and gas supply of all production factories and mines are sufficient and non-stop. Transportation department staff took the initiative in everything, tried every means to ensure the timely transportation of blast furnace raw materials and products. The major spare parts and components for open-hearth furnaces and blast furnaces manufactured by the General Machinery Plant have recently increased sharply by one to three times, and they have taken the initiative to send people to the site to assist in the maintenance and repair of related equipment. Because these departments have served the main factories and mines well, they have promoted the increase in steel production throughout the company.

Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, December 22nd. The workers of Baotou Iron and Steel Company have worked hard to strengthen cooperation and improve operating skills, and have achieved new achievements in production. In mid-December, the average daily output of pig iron increased by 22.4% compared with the first ten days of the month, and the coke ratio decreased by 17.9%; the average daily steel production level increased by 41.8% compared with the first ten days of the month, and the smelting time was greatly shortened.

In order to further increase pig iron production, the workers of the Baotou Iron and Steel Plant further carried out high-quality and high-yield competitions in mid-December. They also worked with the transportation department to concentrate their efforts to solve the problem of transportation within the plant. The workers of the transportation department, focusing on the key to transportation, adopted the method of "fixed machine, fixed area, fixed line", and the three shifts carried out a competition of catching up with each other. In the ten days of mid-December, the transportation station created seven new records, and produced one advanced collective, two excellent locomotives, and forty-three advanced producers. The strengthening of transportation within the factory effectively guaranteed the high production of pig iron.

In order to achieve safe production and shorten smelting time, the Party committee of the steelmaking plant continued to lead the workers to carry out the "three-fix" furnace body maintenance movement of fixing people, fixing parts, and fixing responsibilities, and the "checking hidden dangers, eliminating hidden dangers, and ensuring high production" mechanical equipment maintenance movement since mid-December. Focusing on the key problem of the excessively long open-hearth furnace smelting cycle, the workers, based on the specific conditions of open-hearth furnace smelting, and after on-site experimental summary, revised the operational essentials of open-hearth furnace smelting twice. Workers in various units carried out extensive cooperation around producing more steel to support steelworkers. The workers in the raw materials workshop carried out a material supply cooperation competition. The ingot casting workshop carried out a post-furnace protection of the furnace cooperation competition. The mold-making section carried out a one-stop cooperation performance competition centered on "five fasts" (fast demolding, fast mold sweeping, fast brick laying, fast mold pouring, fast mold matching), which shortened the time for circulating a set of steel ingot molds by more than an hour than before.

Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, December 22nd. The production level of converter steel in Benxi Iron and Steel Company has continued to rise. The average daily output in the first half of December increased by 12.9% compared with the substantially increased November, and the iron consumption per ton of steel smelted also decreased significantly.

At the beginning of December, the Party committee of Benxi Iron and Steel Company further strengthened its specific leadership over converter production, and from the company to the factory and workshop, it strengthened the leadership force in converter production. The company established a night shift duty system, with the Party secretary and manager taking turns on duty; and organized a spare parts and accessories working team, went deep into the machinery and repair departments, and helped arrange the production of key spare parts and accessories such as steel ingot molds, crane gear handles, water tanks, and furnace caps one by one. The transportation department adopted the method of dedicated personnel, dedicated vehicles, dedicated materials, and dedicated use to ensure the supply of materials needed for converter production.

The workers, with the converter as the center, carried out a collaborative covenant competition, and quickly strengthened the weak processes and weak teams. The communist spirit of cooperation was also greatly promoted. Workers at the molten iron furnace accelerated the slag removal process and improved quality, making the molten iron suitable for steelmaking requirements. The ingot makers tried their best to extend the service life of steel ingot molds to ensure the needs of converter steel. The collaborative covenant competition powerfully reversed the past passive situation of "five waiting" in converter production, such as waiting for raw materials, waiting for ingot making, waiting for cranes, waiting for furnace repair, and waiting for transportation, and brought into play the potential of converter production.

In order to smelt more and better steel with less iron, steelworkers carried out technological innovations, saving 105 kilograms of molten iron per ton of steel smelted compared to the past.

    炉前炉后一条心
    多炼好钢迎新春
    鞍钢武钢包钢本钢年终再夺高产
    钢铁工人提高操作技术缩短冶炼时间
    辅助部门发挥协作精神保证增产钢铁
    新华社鞍山22日电　鞍山钢铁公司职工在完成今年计划的最后时刻，把快速炼钢运动推向了新的高潮。12月上半月，各炼钢厂每炉钢的熔炼时间又比11月份全月平均缩短十到二十分钟，钢的日产量比11月份全月平均增长4.9％。
    各厂炼钢工人每天一上班，就争看工厂公布的各座平炉的竞赛指标。发现谁的熔炼时间短、多产钢，立即设法赶上去，哪里有先进经验，就到哪里去学习。第一炼钢厂在11月份竞赛落在兄弟厂后面，这个厂党委书记亲自带队到第二、第三炼钢厂学习加快大罐周转的经验，开展了每班出六炉钢、兑六炉铁水、运出六车废物和无事故运动，大大缩短了炼钢的时间，使12月份生产水平迅速上升，一跃而为最好的单位。第三炼钢厂党委书记立即率领有关人员到第一炼钢厂学习，取经回来马上运用，使各座平炉一个接着一个达到快速炼钢，天天高产，终于又获得了竞赛优胜红旗。
    在快速炼钢运动中，为炼钢服务的各工种职工充分发挥了共产主义协作精神。第一炼钢厂原料工人为给平炉及时供应更多的原料，和使原料配比更准确，采取分兵把口的办法，掌握矿石、废钢的成分配比，使原料合格率比11月末提高10％。第二炼钢厂由于炼钢时间不断缩短，需要的钢水罐和渣罐越来越多。修罐工人为了加速大罐周转，提出了宁肯自己多流汗，不耽误平炉一分钟的口号。他们不等钢水罐和渣罐冷却，就把罐里残损的地方一点一点地修补好，使大罐周转数由十八个增加到二十七个、三十个、三十二个，不断地满足了平炉快速炼钢的需要。
    各炼钢厂职工在争分夺秒地增产钢的同时，时刻注意维护炉体。各厂都抽调有护炉经验的老工人、技术人员和领导干部组成护炉检查组，炼钢工人也展开了护炉竞赛，各个部位都有专人负责，因而炉体越来越健壮，修炉时间大大减少，生产时间大大增加。以第三炼钢厂为例，12月上半月平炉有效作业率比11月份提高5％，有效地保证了快速炼钢运动的健康发展。
    据新华社武汉22日电武汉钢铁公司炼钢职工开展快速炼钢竞赛，钢产量持续上升。12月上旬，钢的平均日产水平比11月份增长了14％，中旬又比上旬提高14.5％。
    加强计划管理、狠抓措施，是炼钢生产不断增长的保证。武钢公司的几位副经理深入炼钢厂，日夜轮流值班，狠抓作业计划和措施，迅速发现和解决生产中的问题。钢产量增长后需要的矿石原料大大增加，公司立即组织矿山和运输部门增加平炉块矿的运量和储量。补炉需要大量镁砂，原燃料处除派专人组织货源外，还自己组织力量回收旧镁砖，加工成镁砂。耐火材料厂职工为了更多更快地供应炼钢所需的焙烧白云石，在五天内就建起了两座焙烧窑。
    为了确保设备安全运转，保证快速炼钢竞赛顺利进行，炼钢厂最近还开展了安全无事故运动，除发动操作人员加强设备维护检修外，还专门组织力量，站岗放哨和巡回检查修理。平炉一支部职工针对平炉即将到检修期、炉顶较薄弱的情况，采取适当减少煤气、避免温度过高过低、加强炉顶吹扫检查等八大措施，努力维护炉顶，执行以来，炉顶吹扫得很干净，维护得很好。
    武汉钢铁公司各附属、辅助单位职工，在公司党委统一领导下，主动为主体厂矿服务，同心协力增产钢铁，作出了显著成绩。一直走在协作竞赛前头的武钢动力厂职工，一个多月来，主动帮助检查和消除了几百个动力设备的缺陷和隐患，并且根据这些工厂的急需，赶制和送上电器备品二百多种五千多件，保证全部生产厂矿的水、电、风、气供应充足，分秒不停。运输部门职工事事主动，多方设法，保证了高炉原料和产品的及时运输。机械总厂制造的平炉、高炉主要备品备件，最近猛增一倍到三倍，并且主动派人到现场协助维护检修有关设备。由于这些部门为主体厂矿服务得好，促进了全公司的钢铁增产。
    新华社包头22日电包头钢铁公司职工努力加强协作，提高操作技术，生产上取得新成就。12月中旬，生铁日产量平均比上旬提高22.4％，焦比下降17.9％；钢的平均日产水平平均比上旬提高41.8％，冶炼时间大大缩短。
    为了进一步提高生铁产量，包钢炼铁厂职工在12月中旬进一步开展了优质高产竞赛。他们还同运输部门一起集中力量解决厂内运输问题。运输部职工针对运输关键，采取了“定机、定区、定线”的办法，三班开展了你追我赶的竞赛。在中旬的十天中，运输站共创造了七次新纪录，涌现出一个先进集体，两个优秀机车和四十三个先进生产者。厂内运输的加强，有效地保证了生铁高产。
    炼钢厂党委为了作到安全生产和缩短冶炼时间，中旬以来继续领导职工开展了定人、定部位、定责任的“三定”维护炉体运动和“查隐患、灭隐患、保高产”的维护机械设备运动。职工们针对平炉冶炼周期过长这一关键，根据平炉冶炼的具体条件，经过现场试验总结，两次修改了平炉冶炼的操作要点。各单位职工围绕多产钢大搞协作，支援炼钢工人。原料车间职工开展了供料协作赛。铸锭车间开展了炉后保炉前的协作赛。整模工段开展了以“五快”（脱模快、扫型快、下砖快、倒型快、配模快）为中心的一条龙协作表演赛，使周转一套钢锭模的时间比以前缩短了一个多小时。
    新华社本溪22日电本溪钢铁公司转炉钢的生产水平连续上升，12月上半月的平均日产量又比大幅度增长的11月提高了12.9％，每炼一吨钢的耗铁量也有了显著下降。
    12月份一开始，本溪钢铁公司党委进一步加强了对转炉生产的具体领导，从公司到厂、车间，都充实了转炉生产的领导力量。公司建立夜班值班制度，由党委书记和经理轮流值班；并组织备品配件工作队，深入机械、修配部门，一个品种一个品种地帮助安排好钢锭模、天车齿轮按手、水箱、炉帽等关键性备品配件的生产。运输部门采取专人、专车、专料、专用的办法，保证了转炉增产所需物资的供应。
    职工们以转炉为中心，开展了协作公约赛，把炉前炉后、左邻右舍拧成一股劲，很快地加强了薄弱工序和薄弱班组。共产主义的协作风气也大大发扬。混铁炉工人加速除渣进度，提高质量，使铁水适合炼钢的要求。造块工人千方百计地延长钢锭模使用寿命，保证转炉钢的需要。协作公约赛，有力地扭转了过去的转炉生产等原料，等造块，等天车，等修炉，等运输的“五等”被动局面，发挥了转炉生产的潜力。
    为了用更少的铁，炼更多更好的钢，炼钢工人进行了技术革新，使每炼一吨钢比过去节约了一百零五公斤铁水。
