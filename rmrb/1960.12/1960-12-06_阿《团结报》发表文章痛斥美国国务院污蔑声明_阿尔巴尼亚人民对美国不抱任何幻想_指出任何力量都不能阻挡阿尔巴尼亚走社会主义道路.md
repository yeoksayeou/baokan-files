Xinhua News Agency, December 4th News: According to the Albanian News Agency on December 3rd, the newspaper "Unity" published an article on December 3rd sternly condemning the despicable statement made by the U.S. State Department during the Albanian people's great festival. The article pointed out that the Albanian people believe that the U.S. State Department's statement is a crude interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign country, violating the principles of international law regarding relations between countries.

The article said that the provocations of the U.S. imperialists cannot scare the Albanian people. The Albanian people have repeatedly recognized the true face of the U.S. imperialist aggressors and provocateurs. Therefore, the Albanian people are not afraid, but feel angry and resolutely despise this new provocative action by the U.S. government.

The article said that the Albanian people have never harbored any illusions about the nature and aims of the U.S. imperialists. They recognize the true face of these imperialists, knowing that they are the vicious enemies of socialist countries and the enemies of people's freedom and peace. The article emphasized that the Albanian people are proud of the just and correct Marxist-Leninist policies of their party and government. Albania's party and government have always condemned the aggressive policies of the United States and pointed out that it is the main danger to world peace.

"The Albanian people will unite more closely around their party and government, raise revolutionary vigilance, in order to ruthlessly strike and shatter every attempt by the imperialist aggressors and their running dogs to undermine their victory. No force in the world can stop the Albanian people from taking the road to socialism. The U.S. imperialists and their various lackeys who are daydreaming must firmly remember this."

    阿尔巴尼亚人民对美国不抱任何幻想
    指出任何力量都不能阻挡阿尔巴尼亚走社会主义道路
    新华社4日讯　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社3日讯：《团结报》3日发表了一篇文章严厉谴责美国国务院在阿尔巴尼亚人民伟大的节日时发表的卑鄙声明。文章指出，阿尔巴尼亚人民认为，美国国务院的声明是对一个主权国家的内政的粗暴干涉，违反了关于国与国之间关系的国际法的原则。
    文章说，美帝国主义者的挑衅是吓不倒阿尔巴尼亚人民的。阿尔巴尼亚人民已经多次认识到美帝国主义侵略者和挑衅者的真面目。因此阿尔巴尼亚人民并不害怕，而是感到愤怒，坚决鄙视美国政府这种新的挑衅行动。
    文章说，阿尔巴尼亚人民对美帝国主义者的本性和目的从来不抱丝毫幻想。他们认识这些帝国主义者的真面目，知道他们是社会主义国家的凶恶敌人，是人民自由与和平的敌人。文章强调说，阿尔巴尼亚人民为他们的党和政府的正义和正确的马克思列宁主义政策而感到自豪。阿尔巴尼亚的党和政府一向谴责美国的侵略政策并指出它是世界和平的主要危险。
    “阿尔巴尼亚人民将更加紧密地团结在他们党和政府的周围，提高革命警惕性，以便无情地打击和粉碎帝国主义侵略者及其走狗破坏他们的胜利的每一个企图。世界上没有任何力量能够阻止阿尔巴尼亚人民走向社会主义的道路。睁着眼睛做梦的美帝国主义者及其各色走狗必须牢牢地记住这一点。”
