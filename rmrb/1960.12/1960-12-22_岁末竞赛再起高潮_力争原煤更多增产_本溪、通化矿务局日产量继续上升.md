Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, 21st:  Workers at the Benxi Mining Bureau have launched a new high tide of coal production competition as the year draws to a close. From December 1st to 15th, the average daily output of raw coal for the entire mine increased by 7.9% compared to November, with prime coking coal increasing by 9.8%.

A high tide of competition has emerged between mining areas, between coal mining teams, and between individuals. Mining Area One of the Caitun Coal Mine is a small mining area with a thin coal seam and poor conditions. In the competition, the workers adopted new technologies of blasting and coal extraction and combine coal cutting, enabling the daily output of the mining area to catch up with the large Mining Area Three, which has a thick coal seam. The workers of Mining Area Three were not to be outdone, and everyone chased after them fiercely, increasing the average daily output since December by 65.2% compared to November. Some mines, such as the Niuxintai Coal Mine, have also developed the single coal mining face competition into a collaborative competition of mechanical and electrical, transportation, and maintenance trades. All trades actively guaranteed the supply of mine cars and pit props and the safe operation of mechanical equipment, providing conditions for high raw coal production.

With the rapid growth of production, insufficient underground transportation capacity has become a key problem. In order to solve this problem, in addition to continuing to make full use of existing mine cars to carry out the "full load" movement, each mine also established and improved management systems, and adopted chart-based car allocation and planned car allocation, which improved the turnover rate of mine cars. A blitz repair was carried out on old and broken mine cars to quickly put them into the transportation battle, increasing transportation capacity.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 21st: A large number of cadres and auxiliary workers at the Tonghua Mining Bureau in Jilin Province have strengthened the front line of mining and tunneling, promoting the continuous increase in the production of coking coal. From December 1st to 14th, the average daily output of raw coal of the entire bureau increased by 9.8% compared to the second half of November. Among them, coking coal has exceeded the production target by 176,500 tons, and refined coal has exceeded the production target by 54,000 tons, completing the annual state plan ahead of schedule.

In December, the workers of various mines under the Tonghua Mining Bureau launched a large team competition centered on "coking, washing, and transporting" to advance into 1961 ahead of schedule. In order to strengthen the leadership of this competition and replenish the strength of the production front line, starting in late November, each mine further rectified the labor organization and drew more than 1,900 cadres and auxiliary workers to support the front line. In adjusting the labor organization, the Party committee of Zhazi Coal Mine thoroughly explained the current excellent situation to all employees and transferred 154 laborers from auxiliary and service departments to replenish the front line. The Bureau's basic construction company adopted the method of tapping internal potential and transferred 600 laborers from the second and third lines to the mining and tunneling front line. Cadres of various agencies under the Bureau also responded to the call of the Bureau Party Committee, resolutely went to the front line to participate in production, assist production, and lead production. At present, 750 cadres have entered the mine, eating, living, working, and discussing with the workers.

    岁末竞赛再起高潮
    力争原煤更多增产
    本溪、通化矿务局日产量继续上升
    新华社本溪21日电　本溪矿务局职工岁末掀起了煤炭生产竞赛新高潮。12月1日至15日，全矿平均原煤日产水平比11月份提高了7.9％，其中主焦煤提高了9.8％。
    各矿采区与采区、采煤队与采煤队、个人与个人之间都出现了竞赛高潮。采屯煤矿的一采区是一个煤层薄、条件差的小采区，职工们在竞赛中采用了放炮落煤和康拜因截煤的新技术，使采区的日产水平赶上了厚煤层的大采区——三采区。三采区职工不甘示弱，大家猛追猛赶，使12月以来的平均日产量比11月份提高65.2％。有的矿井，如牛心台煤矿，还把单一的采煤掌子的对手赛发展为机电、运输、维修等工种的协作赛，各个工种都主动保证矿车、坑木的供应和机械设备的安全运转，为原煤高产提供条件。
    随着生产的迅速增长，井下运输能力不足成为关键问题。为了解决这一问题，各矿除继续充分利用现有矿车开展装满车运动以外，还建立和健全了管理制度，采用了图表配车和计划配车，提高了矿车的周转率；对旧有的坏矿车进行了突击修理，使之迅速投入运输战线，增加了运输力量。
    新华社长春21日电　吉林省通化矿务局大批干部和辅助工人加强采掘第一线，促进焦煤不断增产。12月1日到14日，全局原煤平均日产量比11月下半月平均提高9.8％，其中焦煤已超产十七万六千五百吨，精煤已超产五万四千吨，提前完成了全年国家计划。
    通化矿务局各矿井职工，在12月份开展了以“焦、洗、运”为中心的提前跨进1961年的班组大竞赛。为了加强对这一竞赛的领导，充实生产第一线的力量，各矿井从11月下旬开始，又进一步整顿了劳动组织，抽出一千九百多名干部和辅助工人支援了第一线。砟子煤矿党委在调整劳动组织中，向全体职工深入讲解了当前大好形势，从辅助部门和服务部门中调动一百五十四名劳动力，充实了第一线。局属基本建设公司采取挖掘内部潜力的办法，从第二、第三线调出六百名劳动力，开到采掘第一线。全局各机关干部也纷纷响应局党委的号召，坚决到第一线参加生产，帮助生产和领导生产。现在，全局已有七百五十名干部进入井下，与工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。
