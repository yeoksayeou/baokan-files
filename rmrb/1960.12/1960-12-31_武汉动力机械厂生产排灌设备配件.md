Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan Electric: Wuhan Power Machinery Plant has comprehensively launched preparations for the first quarter of next year's production.

    The factory has completed this year's production tasks for two main products—gas generators and air compressors—and most of the parts production tasks. In November, all factory workers discussed the issues of the whole Party and all people running agriculture in a big way, running grain in a big way, and strengthening agricultural machinery repair and supporting work. They clarified that the main focus of production in the first quarter of next year will be on manufacturing agricultural irrigation and drainage equipment parts and improving the quality of gas generators, while also doing a good job in equipment maintenance. According to this requirement, the factory's Party committee led various functional departments in formulating plans and specific measures, and assigned the parts production tasks for the first quarter of next year to the teams and machines. Among them, fifteen types of parts have already started production.

    In order to meet the needs of expanding parts production tasks, all factory workers are seizing the opportunity to improve the achievements of technical innovation and increase the production capacity of equipment. In the past month and a half, they have improved six indigenous equipment items, such as hydraulic sand cleaning machines, sand falling machines, and crankshaft mold loss molding machines, and also newly manufactured twelve sets of indigenous equipment for one-stop processing of clutches and rocker arms, and four special indigenous lathes.

    武汉动力机械厂生产排灌设备配件
    据新华社武汉电  武汉动力机械厂全面开展了明年第一季度生产的准备工作。
    这个厂已经完成今年两种主要产品——煤气机和空气压缩机的生产任务，配件生产任务也大部分完成。十一月份，全厂职工讨论了全党全民大办农业、大办粮食和加强农业机械修理配套工作的问题，明确了明年第一季度的生产，以制造农业排灌设备配件和提高煤气机的质量为主攻方向，同时做好设备维修工作。根据这个要求，工厂党委领导各职能科室订出了计划和各项具体措施，将明年第一季度的配件生产任务落实到班组、机台，其中有十五种配件已下料生产。
    适应配件生产任务扩大的需要，全厂职工正在抓紧提高技术革新成果，增加设备的生产能力。近一个半月来，他们已经把水力清砂机、落砂机、曲轴漏模造型机等六项土设备加以改进、提高，还新制了十二台离合器和摇臂一条龙加工的土设备，四台专用土车床。
