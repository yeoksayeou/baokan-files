    Manage Replanted Wheat First

    The Mawei Production Team of the Mawei Commune in Xingping County, Shaanxi, put forward the slogan "Take fertilizer as the commander, manage replanted wheat first" in the winter management of wheat fields. This slogan gave us great inspiration: to win a bumper harvest of wheat next year, we must first manage replanted wheat; to manage replanted wheat well, we must take fertilizer as the commander.

    Why must we manage replanted wheat first? This year, replanted wheat in Shaanxi Province accounts for more than half of the total wheat field area. Whether the replanted wheat can increase production next year, and how much it will increase, has a decisive significance for the balanced high yield of summer fields next year and the increase in total summer grain income. The number of tillers of wheat before winter largely determines the number of effective tillers after returning to green and jointing in the spring. At present, the tillering situation of many replanted wheat is not very good, with an average of only one or two per plant, and some even have no tillers. This shows that it is imperative to rush to manage replanted wheat.

    Why must we take fertilizer as the commander when managing replanted wheat first? This year, the sowing situation of replanted wheat in various places is very inconsistent. Some applied little base fertilizer, some sowed white seeds, and some sowed on hard stubble. The growth of wheat seedlings is also uneven, some are yellow, and some are thin and weak. To turn wheat seedlings from yellow to green, fertilizer must catch up; to turn weak seedlings into strong seedlings, fertilizer plays a decisive role; to have more tillers and good roots for wheat, fertilizer is even more indispensable.

    How can we achieve taking fertilizer as the commander and managing replanted wheat first? Various places have adopted many effective measures. These measures can be summarized into four words: early, fast, more, and skillful. Early means seizing the time and applying fertilizer early. According to records: the nitrogen fertilizer required by wheat from tillering to booting generally accounts for the vast majority of the total nitrogen, and the tillering period requires nearly half. This winter, the weather is cold early, and the ground temperature is getting lower and lower, and the time is getting more and more limited. Early topdressing seizes the vigorous opportunity for wheat tillering and rooting, so that fertilizer can be quickly dissolved and absorbed by plants, promoting tillering and rooting.

    With early, we must also be fast. Early and fast are complementary dialectical relationships. Only fast can make it play a more significant role early. We must actively organize forces, concentrate tools, and accumulate, transport, and spread at the same time; accumulate quickly, transport quickly, spread quickly, and fight a quick battle to achieve a quick victory.

    Next year, if we want to win a better harvest of replanted wheat than in any previous year, we must apply more fertilizer than in previous years. Applying more fertilizer is also good for controlling the rapid growth of wheat plants in the early stage and preventing premature aging in the later stage.

    Having achieved early, fast, and more, we must also pay attention to skillful. Grasping skillful can use steel on the blade, so that limited fertilizer can play a greater role, and also avoid many man-made losses.

    In order to rapidly launch and win a complete victory in the winter wheat field management campaign centered on taking fertilizer as the commander and managing replanted wheat first, we must also strengthen investigation and research work. Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, absorb local and foreign experts, go deep into the fields, check field by field, plot by plot, classify and view, view and discuss at the same time, and we will find the key points of local wheat field management and grasp the main contradictions. Once the key points are found and the main contradictions are grasped, powerful measures can be taken to concentrate superior forces, capture positions one by one, and accumulate small victories into big victories. The Mawei Production Team did this. It is precisely because they did this that all the replanted wheat was fertilized quickly once, the regular wheat was fertilized, and the replanted wheat's irrigation, pest control, and harrowing to preserve moisture were also carried out vigorously.

### 先管回茬麦

    先管回茬麦
    陕西兴平县马嵬公社马嵬生产队在麦田越冬管理中，提出了“以肥为帅，先管回茬”的口号。这个口号给了我们很大启示，就是要夺得明年小麦大丰收，眼前必须先管回茬麦；要管好回茬麦，又必须以肥为帅。
    为什么必须先管回茬麦呢？今年，陕西全省的回茬麦占到麦田总面积的一半以上。来年的回茬麦能不能增产，增产多少，对于明年夏田均衡高产和增加夏粮总收入，有着决定性的意义。小麦冬前分蘖多少，在很大程度上决定着明春返青拔节后有效分蘖的多少。现在，不少回茬麦分蘖的情况不很好，平均每株只不过一、二个，有的甚至没有分蘖。这说明抢管回茬麦，已到了刻不容缓的时候。
    先管回茬麦又为什么必须以肥为帅呢？今年各地回茬麦播种情况很不一致，有的施底肥不多，有的白籽下种，有的硬茬下种。麦苗生长也很参差不齐，有的发黄，有的细弱。要麦苗由黄转绿，肥料必须赶上去；要弱苗变壮苗，肥料起着决定作用；要麦子分蘖多，盘好根，离了肥料更不行。
    怎样才能做到以肥为帅，先管回茬？各地采取了很多行之有效的措施。这些措施归纳起来，不外是早、快、多、巧四个字。早，就是抢时间，早施肥。根据记载：小麦从分蘖到孕穗需要的氮肥一般要占到总氮量的绝大部分，而分蘖时期则需要将近一半。今冬天气冷得早，地温越来越低，时间越来越有限。早追肥，就抢住了小麦分蘖、盘根的旺盛时机，能使肥料很快溶解，被植株吸收，促进分蘖，盘根。
    有了早，还得快。早和快，是相辅相成的辩证关系。只有快，才能使之早发挥更显著的作用。我们一定要积极组织力量，集中工具，边积、边拉、边撒；积快、拉快、撒快，速战速决。
    明年，我们要夺得回茬麦比以往任何一年都要好的收成，就要比往年施更多的肥料。多施肥对控制麦株前期陡长，防止后期早衰也有好处。
    做到了早、快、多，还要注意巧。抓住了巧，就能把钢用到刀刃上，使有限的肥料发挥更大的作用，也可避免许多人为的损失。
    为了使以肥为帅，先管回茬为中心的麦田越冬管理运动在最短时间内迅速开展起来，并取得全胜，还必须加强调查研究工作。在各级党的领导下，吸收土洋专家，深入田间，逐方、逐块，分类查看，边查看、边议，就会找出当地麦田管理的重点，抓住主要矛盾。找到了重点，抓住了主要矛盾，就能采取强有力的措施，集中优势兵力，一个一个夺取阵地，集小胜为大胜。马嵬生产队这样做了。也正是由于这样做了，所有回茬麦施肥，很快施完一次肥，给正茬麦施肥，回茬麦的灌水、防虫、耙耱保墒也做得有声有色。
