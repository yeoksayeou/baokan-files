    Extracting Steel from Time
    Chen Tao
    Recently, I visited a steel plant and was deeply moved by the steelmaking scene. Steel flowers flew, molten iron flowed, and the steelmaking heroes fought fiercely in front of the furnace. The blazing fire illuminated their excited faces, and their hearts also leaped with the steel flowers. Their slogan is: Time is steel! Seize every minute and second, and firmly grasp the time!
    The workers are seizing time, and the responsible comrades of the plant's Party committee are also seizing time. Some are focusing on production, some on living conditions, and some are specifically addressing key issues in production. The goal is the same: to extract steel from time and better complete this year's steelmaking task. From top to bottom, everyone is seriously and diligently grasping things tightly. We must turn ambitious goals and specific measures into steel products. We feel their drive and appreciate their determination, and we are completely confident that they will definitely get the steel!
    This "grasping" is very important, both in steelmaking and in any other work. Only by taking action to grasp, and grasping tightly without letting go, and grasping to the end, can we achieve our goals. "Grasping to the end" has two meanings: one is to grasp with a beginning and an end, and never give up until the goal is achieved. The other is to grasp down to the "bottom layer," so that our tasks and resolutions do not remain at the top but become the actual actions of everyone, so that everyone grasps together, from top to bottom and left to right, giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. This way, we can grasp well, grasp accurately, and grasp effectively.
    Many tasks are waiting for us to do, and many missions are waiting for us to complete. Where there is work, there are contradictions. To do a good job, we must study the contradictions in the work and discover the regularity of doing a good job, which requires us to grasp. If we grasp these things correctly, things will be easier. However, this is only half of the problem. Work is done by people. Discovering objective laws and grasping the key to the problem is certainly important, but if we do not grasp the organization of work tightly, and do not grasp the work of "people" tightly, grasping to the end, and fully utilize everyone's subjective initiative, this cannot be called grasping tightly, and the work will still not be done well. Chairman Mao taught us: "Anything can only be grasped if it is grasped tightly and not relaxed at all. Grasping without tightening is the same as not grasping. Sticking out your palm, of course, you can't grasp anything. Even if you clench your hand, but don't clench it tightly, it looks like you are grasping, but you still can't grasp anything." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume IV, page 1443)
    Our steelworkers are seizing time to extract steel; our rural commune members are seizing nature to extract grain; our builders on all fronts are seizing all available conditions to increase the power of socialism. We also encounter such and such difficulties, but we are not only not intimidated by them, but instead grasp them tightly and turn unfavorable conditions into favorable conditions, and turn difficulties into the driving force for our progress. Let us all learn from the steelworkers and the heroic figures from all walks of life their drive and determination, and spur our horses to move quickly toward 1961!

    向时间要钢
    陈涛
    最近参观了一个钢铁厂，深深地被炼钢的场面所感动。钢花飞舞，铁水奔流，炼钢好汉们一个个奋战炉前，熊熊的炉火照亮了他们兴奋的脸庞，他们的心也随着钢花欢腾跳跃，他们的口号是：时间就是钢！分秒必争，紧紧抓住时间！
    工人们在抓时间，厂党委的负责同志们也在抓时间，有的抓生产，有的抓生活，有的专门抓生产中的关键问题。目的都是一个：向时间要钢，更好地完成今年的炼钢任务。从上到下，都在认真踏实地抓紧。要把雄心大志、具体措施都变成一根根钢材。我们感受到他们的干劲，体会到他们的抓劲，也就完全确信：他们一定能把钢要到手！
    这个“抓”很要紧，炼钢是这样，做其他任何工作也是这样。只有动手去抓，而且抓住不放，一抓到底，才能达到目的。“一抓到底”，有两层意思：一个是要抓得有始有终，不达目的决不罢休。一个是要抓到“底层”去，使我们的任务、决议，不停留在上面，成为每一个人的实际行动，让大家都来抓，上下左右一齐抓，发挥群众的积极性和创造性，这样就能抓得好，抓得准，抓得有成效。
    许多工作等着我们去做，许多任务等着我们去完成。有工作就有矛盾，要做好工作，就要研究工作中的矛盾，发现做好工作的规律性，这就要靠我们去抓。这些都抓对了，事情就好办了。然而这还只是问题的一半。工作是靠人做的，发现了客观规律，抓住了问题的关键，这当然是很重要的，但是如果不抓紧组织工作，不抓紧做好“人”的工作，一抓到底，充分发挥大家的主观能动性，这也还不能叫做抓紧，工作也还会做不好。毛主席教导我们说：“什么东西只有抓得很紧，毫不放松，才能抓住。抓而不紧，等于不抓。伸着巴掌，当然什么也抓不住。就是把手握起来，但是不握紧，样子像抓，还是抓不住东西。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷1443页）
    我们的炼钢工人正在抓紧时间要钢；我们的农村公社社员正在抓紧自然要粮食；我们的各个战线上的建设者正在抓紧一切可以利用的条件，为社会主义增加威力。我们也遇到这样那样的困难，但是我们不但没被它吓倒，反而抓住它不放，使不利条件转化成有利条件，使困难转化成推动我们前进的力量。让我们大家都来学习炼钢工人和各行各业英雄好汉们的干劲和抓劲，快马加鞭地奔向1961年！
