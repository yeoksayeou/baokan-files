Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 23rd: According to a broadcast by the "Voice of Laos" radio station today, the Lao Kingdom government has recently received many letters and telegrams from people in various parts of the country expressing support for the legitimate government and opposition to the aggression of US imperialism in Laos.

The radio station said that since Kou Abhay launched a riot in Vientiane, especially since the US imperialists, the Thai reactionaries, and the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Nacjamphone traitorous clique attacked Vientiane, the Kingdom government has received more than 300 letters, proposals, and telegrams from the people of Luang Prabang, Phongsaly, Saravane Province, and many other places.

In these letters, proposals, and telegrams, people from all over expressed their support for the Souvanna Phouma legitimate government, opposition to the interference and aggression of US imperialism and Thai reactionaries in Laos, and opposition to the traitorous actions of the Phoumi-Boun Oum clique.

The radio station said that the Kingdom government welcomes this patriotic spirit of the people across the country in caring about the fate of their motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 23rd: According to a broadcast by the Lao Fighting Forces radio station on the 22nd, more than 200 representatives of the Lao Theung and Lao Long ethnic groups in Muang Houn district, Phongsaly province, including 65 women representatives, held a national unity conference on the 16th. The meeting passed a resolution expressing firm opposition to the aggression of US imperialism and the reactionaries of Thailand, South Vietnam, and the Philippines against Laos, and opposition to the traitorous behavior of the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Nacjamphone group. The resolution also expressed praise for the heroic spirit of the military and civilians of Vientiane in recently repelling enemy attacks.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 23rd: The Lao Fighting Forces radio station broadcast tonight: The Lao Kingdom government representative, Minister of Propaganda, Quinim Pholsena, arrived in Khang Khay on December 22nd. Quinim and his entourage were warmly and solemnly welcomed by Prince Souphanouvong, leader of the Lao Patriotic Front, and the people of Khang Khay.

The broadcast said that Quinim's purpose in coming to Khang Khay is to hold talks with Prince Souphanouvong on the current important issues in Laos, given the interference and aggression of US imperialism and Thai reactionaries in Laos, and the expansion of the Lao civil war by the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Nacjamphone traitorous clique.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 23rd: The Lao Fighting Forces radio station published a commentary today, sternly criticizing the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Nacjamphone traitorous clique's clamor to "punish" Lao patriots, and pointed out that the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique must be punished by the Lao people.

The commentary said that according to foreign news agencies, the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique recently slandered Prince Souvanna Phouma and blatantly announced that it would "punish" Quinim Pholsena, the Minister of Propaganda of the Phouma government, Captain Kong Le, Lieutenant Thoun, and those who participated in the August 9th coup.

The commentary pointed out that the arrogant attitude of the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique has caused immense indignation among the Lao people. The commentary pointed out that this once again clearly proves that it is the traitorous clique that has committed the heinous crime of selling out the interests of the motherland and the people to the United States in exchange for US dollars that will be punished as they deserve by the Lao people.

The commentary pointed out, after listing the traitorous crimes of the Phoumi-Boun Oum group, that the fate of Nuri as-Said of Iraq and Adnan Menderes of Turkey awaits them.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 23rd: According to a war report issued today by the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces of the Lao Fighting Forces broadcast by the Lao Fighting Forces radio station, the armed forces of the Lao Fighting Forces attacked the two strongholds of Chong Ka Da and Pa Bop in Phongsaly province on December 19th. The two companies of rebels entrenched in these two strongholds were routed and fled in all directions, with many killed and wounded, and two captured. The Lao Fighting Forces seized 50 various types of guns, two tons of rice, and some military supplies from the rebels.

Faced with the offensive of the Lao Fighting Forces, the rebels entrenched in the Muong Dai stronghold were also panic-stricken and abandoned the stronghold and fled.

The Lao Fighting Forces radio station broadcast on the 22nd another war report issued by the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces of the Lao Fighting Forces, saying that on December 19th, the armed forces of the Lao Fighting Forces intercepted a group of rebels who were crossing the Nam Ngum River preparing to go to Vientiane. Part of the rebels were annihilated on the water, and part were annihilated on the shore, and the remnants fled in disarray.

The Lao Fighting Forces also attacked a part of the rebels in the Hep Keo area on Route 13, causing them serious losses. In addition, on the North Xan to Vientiane road, the government forces also repeatedly ambushed the rebels.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 23rd: The Lao Fighting Forces radio station broadcast today: When the armed forces of the Lao Fighting Forces attacked Luang Prabang city on December 18th, ten soldiers from a certain rebel stronghold (including four sergeants first class, four sergeants, and two privates) came out to surrender with five carbines and two rifles. These soldiers have volunteered to join the armed forces of the Lao Fighting Forces to resist the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Nacjamphone traitorous clique. (Attached picture)
