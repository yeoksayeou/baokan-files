Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 16th: The supply of many famous brand small commodities in the Shanghai market has increased, and new varieties and designs are also emerging continuously.

　　In order to develop the production of traditional famous brand small commodities, Shanghai commercial departments, in addition to organizing the original factories producing famous brand goods to continue production, have also adopted a combination of factories and stores. One is that famous stores have attached workshops to produce famous brand small commodities. There are now dozens of such "both factory and store" workshops in the city. The other is that related factories are directly linked to stores to produce the characteristic commodities operated by these stores. In this regard, there are currently more than 1,000 street and alley workshops and more than 35,000 residents specializing in processing and producing various small commodities. Some of them, with the guidance of commercial departments in technology and support in equipment, have begun to produce distinctive products such as plastic hair clips, bone buttons, and rattan walking sticks.

　　Producing famous brand small commodities, especially handicrafts, generally requires higher skills. Shanghai commercial departments have made proper arrangements for old workers with high skills and experience in terms of production and life, allowing them to concentrate on producing small commodities they are good at. Some workers who have changed careers are also being gradually organized to return to their original posts. At the same time, methods such as master-apprentice teaching and learning-by-doing are adopted to train "successors."

　　Shanghai's relevant materials departments, in the spirit of overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement, allocate a considerable amount of raw materials for the production of famous brand products. This year, hundreds of mao bamboo poles with green color, thick branches, and long sections have been supplied specifically for the production of well-known products such as water-milled bamboo chopsticks, high-grade fishing rods, and large dance fans. In addition, a batch of high-quality steel is allocated monthly for the special needs of opening the "cutting edge" of vegetable knives. Some waste and substandard steel, small pieces of wood, and scrap cloth needed for handicrafts are also uniformly arranged for dedicated use. Relevant industries have also strengthened cooperation with production areas in other provinces. This year, people have been sent to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian and other places to purchase a batch of bamboo materials, glass beads, boxwood comb blanks and other small commodity raw materials.

　　After adopting the above measures, the supply of famous brand small commodities in the Shanghai market is more abundant, and the varieties and designs are more diverse. The Old City God Temple, a commercial district that deals in traditional small commodities, now operates more varieties and designs of commodities than ever before. Since the beginning of this year, the mall's supply of various toys, hair clips, buttons and other famous small commodities has increased by more than half compared with the same period last year. The quality of some famous brand small commodities has also been further improved. For example, the famous "Wang Da Long" knives and scissors factory has launched a technological revolution this year, using air forging hammers instead of manual forging, making the black steel on the blade exceptionally uniform and smooth, and more sharp and durable. Many distinctive stores have implemented a combination of factory and store, and production and sales linkage, and are producing new varieties of small commodities at any time according to market needs. "Le Yuan Chang," a famous hardware store for daily use in Shanghai, has recently produced a batch of new products such as glass ironing spray bottles, aluminum alloy shoehorns, and stainless steel eyebrow tweezers by its affiliated workshop, which are very popular. Now, this store operates more than 700 varieties of hardware small commodities, an increase from more than 400 in the past. Guo Zhiji Store, Shanghai's only store specializing in interior decoration hardware, is directly linked to more than 20 small commodity factories and more than 10 street and alley production organizations, and has also produced many products with special specifications.
　
Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou: Anyang City, Henan Province, has vigorously developed the production of short-supply small commodities. Since the beginning of this year, in addition to restoring the production of more than 1,500 old products, it has also successfully trial-produced more than 400 new products. Products that have always relied on external supply, such as paper umbrellas, porcelain bowls, bamboo shell water bottles, iron-clad locks, stapler staples, shoe nails, soap, and valve needles, have been supplied to the market in large quantities and have achieved self-sufficiency. Some products have also supported the needs of brother counties and cities in the province. In order to vigorously develop the production of small commodities, especially the production of short-supply products, the Anyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China organized relevant departments to establish a Small Commodity Production Collaboration Committee, established a Small Commodity Production Office, strengthened specific leadership, and formulated a production plan for short-supply products.

　　Many factories have universally established new product trial production teams, sent people to other places to visit and learn production technology, and in the spirit of "making do with whatever is available and relying on our own efforts," they have tried every means to overcome difficulties such as lack of equipment, technology, and raw materials. In order to meet the urgent market demand for stapler staples, thumbtacks, and paper clips, the stationery factory sent people to Shanghai Xingchang Machinery Factory to learn technical experience. After returning to the factory, it successfully trial-produced stapler staples in two days, which have been put into production in large quantities. Thumbtacks and paper clips will also be available in batches to the market before the end of the year.

    传授技艺　增辟原料　革新技术　精益求精
    上海积极增产名牌小商品
    安阳大力生产缺门小商品部分产品自给有余
    新华社上海16日电　上海市场上许多名牌小商品的供应量增加，新的花色品种也陆续出现。
    为了发展传统的名牌小商品生产，上海商业部门除组织原来生产名牌货的工厂继续生产以外，还采取了工场和商店结合的形式。一种是著名商店附设工场生产名牌小商品，现在全市这种“亦工亦商”工场已有数十家。另一种是有关工场同商店直接挂钩，生产这家商店经营的有特色的商品。这方面，目前已有一千多个街道、里弄工场，三万五千多居民专门加工生产各种小商品，其中一部分经过商业部门辅导技术、支援设备，已开始生产塑料发夹、牙骨纽扣、藤手杖等有特色的产品。
    生产名牌小商品，特别是手工业品，一般需要较高的技艺。上海商业部门对手艺高、有经验的老工人，在生产和生活上给予妥善安排，让他们专心生产擅长的小商品，有些改了行的工人也正在陆续组织归队。同时，采取师傅带徒弟、边教边干的方式，培训“接班人”。
    上海有关物资部门本着统筹兼顾、全面安排的精神，为名牌产品的生产调拨相当数量的原料材料。今年已经供应数百支色青、枝粗、节长的毛竹，专门生产水磨竹筷、高级钓鱼竿、大型舞蹈扇等著名产品。另外还按月分配一批优质钢材用于菜刀开“刀刃”的特殊需要。对手工业需要的一部分废次钢材、小木料、碎布等，也统一安排，实行专料专用。有关行业又加强同外地产区的协作，今年已先后派人到江苏、浙江、福建等地，采购了一批竹料、玻璃珠子、黄杨梳篦料坯等小商品原料。
    采取上述措施以后，上海市场上名牌小商品供应更加充裕，花色品种更加繁多。老城隍庙这个经营传统小商品的商场，目前经营的商品花色品种已经超过历史上的最高水平。今年以来，商场供应的各式玩具、发夹、纽扣等著名小商品，比去年同期增加一半以上。有些名牌小商品的质量也有进一步提高。例如有名的“王大隆”刀剪，今年工场大闹技术革新，采用气磅鎯头代替手工打铁，刀刃上的乌钢打得分外均匀平整，更加锋利耐用。许多有特色的商店实行场店结合、产销挂钩以后，都随时根据市场需要，生产新花色的小商品。上海著名的日用五金商店“乐源昌”，最近由附属工场生产了一批玻璃烫衣喷水壶、铝质合金鞋拔、不锈钢眉毛镊子等新产品，很受欢迎。现在这家商店经营的五金小商品，花色规格从过去的四百多种增加到七百多种。上海唯一专营室内装璜五金的郭志记商店，同二十多家小商品工场、十多个街道里弄生产组织直接挂钩，也生产了许多规格特殊的产品。
    新华社郑州电　河南省安阳市大力发展缺门小商品生产，今年以来，除恢复一千五百多种老产品生产以外，还试制成功新产品四百多种。历来依靠外地供应的纸伞、瓷碗、竹壳水瓶、铁包锁、订书针、鞋钉、香皂、汽门针等产品，都已经大批供应市场，作到自给。一些产品还支援了省内兄弟县、市需要。为了大力发展小商品生产，特别是缺门产品的生产，中共安阳市委组织有关部门成立小商品生产协作委员会，建立小商品生产办公室，加强了具体领导，制定了缺门产品的生产规划。
    许多工厂普遍建立新产品试制小组，派人到外地参观学习生产技术，并本着“因陋就简，自力更生”的精神，千方百计战胜缺乏设备、技术和原料等困难。文具用品厂为满足市场对订书针、大头针、曲别针的迫切需要，派人到上海兴昌机器厂学习技术经验，回厂后两天中就试制成功订书针，已经大批投入生产。大头针、曲别针年底以前也可成批供应市场。
