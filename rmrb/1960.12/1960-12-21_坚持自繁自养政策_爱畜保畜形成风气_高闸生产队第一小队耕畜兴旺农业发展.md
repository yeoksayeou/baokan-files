Adhering to the Policy of Self-Breeding and Self-Raising, Cherishing and Protecting Livestock Becomes a Common Practice
The First Team of Gaozha Production Brigade Prospers in Livestock and Develops Agriculture
The number of draught animals has increased by one and a half times in three years, all tasks are completed on time, and the intensity of labor is greatly reduced.
Our newspaper, Yinchuan, 20th dispatch: The First Team of Gaozha Production Brigade, Malianqu Commune, Wuzhong City, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, due to its adherence to self-breeding and self-raising of draught animals, and constant education of its members to cherish and protect livestock, establishing the idea of "using livestock to ensure grain," has seen its draught animals rapidly develop from 36 heads to 92 heads in the past three years. This has continuously provided strong animal power for large-scale agriculture and grain production, and effectively promoted the development of agricultural production.
In 1957, the first team of Gaozha had 36 draught animals, both large and small, of which only 23 were able to work, with each animal bearing an average burden of more than 16 mu of cultivated land. Cultivation was extensive and grain yield was not high. At that time, field transportation and most farm work had to rely on human backs and shoulders, and there was no strength to cultivate large areas of nearby wasteland. After communization, in order to change the backward state of agricultural production caused by insufficient animal power, the team put forward the slogan of "self-breeding and self-raising of livestock, using livestock to ensure grain," and educated its members to raise and use livestock well. At the same time, it formulated and improved the livestock breeding and management system: (1) Establish a specialized breeding group, with fixed personnel for feeding and management. All types of draught animals are fed in separate pens and troughs according to gender, size, and strength; pregnant animals are subject to a "three prohibitions" (prohibiting the use of pregnant animals to grind flour, mill rice, or pull large carts); (2) A cart work professional group is established for work tasks, with fixed personnel for use, to ensure that draught animals can combine work and rest. At the same time, the daily working hours and work quotas for horses, cattle, and donkeys are stipulated.
In the implementation of the above-mentioned breeding and management system, the team also particularly strengthened organizational leadership and regularly conducted education on cherishing and protecting livestock among its members to ensure the realization of various systems. Among the team's four captains, one is often assigned to be in charge of livestock breeding and management. No matter how busy the farm work is, when the team committee discusses, inspects, and summarizes the team's production work, it often lists livestock breeding and management as an important agenda item. If members or breeders are found to be not cherishing livestock or not implementing the breeding and management system, criticism and education are promptly carried out. Due to the constant attention to ideological education on cherishing and protecting livestock, a good atmosphere of "everyone is responsible for cherishing and protecting livestock" has been formed in the team. Regardless of day or night, wind or rain, once it is discovered that a livestock is sick, the members immediately report to the team committee and actively and voluntarily try to treat it. Once, when a cow became ill, the secretary of the team's Party branch, after learning about it, led the cow to the Wuzhong City Livestock Hospital, dozens of miles away, for treatment. Shi Xiao, the leader of the team's breeding professional group, is a person praised by the members as "loving livestock as his own children." He carefully fed a thin calf that lost its mother only seven days after birth for dozens of days and finally raised it. Since taking on the work of a breeder, he has been commended and rewarded by the commune and the production team nine times. Shi Fu, a young member of the cart work professional group, has also been commended by the commune this summer for his care for livestock over the years.
Due to everyone's love for livestock and the serious implementation of the breeding and management system, the team has increased its draught animals by more than one and a half times in three years through the method of "self-breeding and self-raising." Among the existing 92 draught animals, the number that can be used for work has increased from 23 in 1957 to 59. While the team's cultivated land area has expanded by more than 70% compared to 1957, the average cultivated land burden per animal has decreased from more than 16 mu in 1957 to more than 10 mu. The continuous increase in animal power has brought new changes to the team's production. The first is that the arrangement of farm work is more proactive. Since the beginning of this year, the planting of various crops, from fertilizer application, sowing, harvesting and transportation to threshing and storage, has all been completed on time; plowing was completed ahead of neighboring teams. Secondly, the short-distance transportation and long-distance transportation of fuel and urban manure, which used to occupy the most labor, are now mostly borne by animal power, freeing a large number of laborers from the heavy labor of carrying on their backs and shoulders. Thirdly, due to the large number of livestock and fertilizer, the average amount of fertilizer applied per mu of land this year has reached about 16 carts, and the amount of fertilizer applied to wheat, rice, hemp, and vegetables is even greater. Currently, the animal manure accumulated for next year's spring plowing accounts for more than 50% of the total amount of accumulated manure.
The team has made preparations for the safe wintering of livestock in advance. The stored forage grass has been arranged to have a surplus even when summer crops are on the market next year; the feed for each draught animal has also been reserved according to the prescribed standards and is kept in special warehouses. The breeders also have a clear idea after classifying and ranking which livestock need to be fed more to gain weight in winter. Now, the livestock in the team are all in good condition, and 24 of the team's 28 female livestock of reproductive age are pregnant. The members are full of confidence in the increased production of livestock next year and the bumper harvest of crops due to the increased strength of the livestock.

    坚持自繁自养政策　爱畜保畜形成风气
    高闸生产队第一小队耕畜兴旺农业发展
    三年耕畜增加一倍半，各项活路不违农时，劳动强度大大减轻
    本报银川20日电　宁夏回族自治区吴忠市马莲渠公社高闸生产队第一小队，由于坚持自繁自养耕畜和经常教育社员爱畜保畜，树立以畜保粮思想，三年来全队耕畜由三十六头迅速发展到九十二头，为大办农业、大办粮食不断提供了雄厚的畜力，有力地促进了农业生产的发展。
    高闸第一小队在1957年有大小耕畜三十六头，其中能够使役的只有二十三头，平均每头役畜负担耕地十六亩多，耕作粗放，粮食产量不高；当时田间运输和绝大部分农活，只得靠人背肩挑；附近大片荒地无力开垦。公社化后，这个小队为了改变畜力不足而造成的农业生产的落后状况，提出了“自繁自养牲畜，以畜保粮”的口号，教育社员养好用好牲畜。与此同时并制定和健全了牲畜饲养管理制度：（1）建立饲养专业组，固定专人饲养管理。各类耕畜都按照公母、大小、强弱，实行分圈分槽喂养；对孕畜实行
  “三禁”（禁止用孕畜推磨、碾米或拉大车）；（2）使役上设有车工专业组，固定专人使用，保证耕畜做到劳逸结合。同时规定了马、牛、驴每天使役时间和工作定额。
    这个小队在执行以上饲养管理制度中，还特别加强组织领导工作和对社员经常进行爱畜保畜教育，以保证各项制度实现。小队的四个队长中，经常有一人分工专管牲畜饲养管理工作。队里不管农活多忙，队委会讨论、检查和总结全队的生产工作时，经常把牲畜饲养管理工作列为一项重要议程。如果发现社员或饲养员中有不爱护牲畜和不执行饲养管理制度的行为，便及时进行批评教育。由于经常抓紧爱畜保畜的思想教育，这个队形成了一种“爱畜保畜人人有责”的良好风气。不管白天黑夜、风里雨里，一旦发现那个牲畜有病，社员就当即报告队委会并积极主动地设法治疗。有一次，一头牛得了病，小队党支部书记知道后，牵上牛，到几十里外的吴忠市家畜病院去医治。这个队的饲养专业组的组长石孝是一位被社员赞誉为“爱畜如子”的人物。他把一头产后只有七天就失去母牛的瘦弱牛犊，经过几十天的精心饲养，终于把它养活了。他从担任饲养员工作以来，已经先后受到公社和生产队的九次表扬和奖励。车工专业组的青年社员石福，几年来由于爱护牲畜，今年夏天也受到公社的表扬。
    由于人人爱畜保畜和对饲养管理制度的认真执行，这个小队在三年之间以“自繁自养”的办法，使耕畜增加了一倍半以上。现有的九十二头耕畜中，能够使役的已由1957年的二十三头增加到五十九头。全队在耕地面积比1957年扩大70％多的情况下，平均每头役畜负担的耕地已由1957年的十六亩多下降到十亩多。畜力不断增加，给这个小队的生产带来的新的变化，首先是农活安排更加主动。今年以来，各种农作物的种植从送肥、播种、收运到打场、入仓，全都不违农时；翻地比邻队提前完成了任务。其次是过去占用劳力最多的短途运输和拉运燃料、城粪等远距离运输，现在绝大部分都由畜力担负起来了，使大批劳动力从人背肩挑的繁重劳动中解放出来。再次，由于畜多肥多，今年平均每亩田的施肥量达到十六车左右，小麦、水稻、大麻、蔬菜的施肥量更多。目前为明年春耕积攒的畜肥，已占到全部积肥总量的50％以上。
    这个小队已提前作好了牲畜安全过冬的准备工作。储备的饲草已经安排到明年夏季作物上场时节还有剩余；每头耕畜的饲料也按规定标准留足，实行了专仓保管。饲养员对那头牲畜需要在冬季加料增膘，经过分类排队以后也做到了胸中有数。现在这个小队头头耕畜膘满体壮，全队二十八头适龄母畜中，有二十四头都已怀胎，社员们对明年牲畜的增产和由于牲畜力量增加农作物的丰收更有保证，都充满着很大的信心。
