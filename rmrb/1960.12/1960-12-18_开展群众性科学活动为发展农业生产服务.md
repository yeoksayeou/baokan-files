Launching Mass Scientific Activities to Serve the Development of Agricultural Production
Liu Yunzhong, Deputy Director of the Gansu Provincial Science and Technology Commission

(I)

The establishment of science and technology undertakings by the People's Communes has great and far-reaching significance for better implementing the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation for developing the national economy, rapidly developing grain production, and promoting the leap-forward development of the national economy.

The object of agricultural production is living plants, which are largely subject to natural conditions. Complex and multifaceted factors influence the growth and development of crops, and some of these factors are currently beyond human control or cannot be fully controlled. In order to rapidly improve the level of agricultural production and stabilize and continuously increase grain output, it is necessary to develop the science and technology undertakings of the People's Communes, strengthen agricultural scientific research, and ensure that science and technology keep pace with production and even precede it, thus promoting production.

In recent years, the science and technology departments of Gansu Province have conscientiously implemented the Party's complete set of policies for developing science and technology undertakings by "walking on two legs." As a result, the province's scientific research activities have developed vigorously. Organizationally, it has grown from scratch, from small to large, from top to bottom. Currently, People's Communes, factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, and schools across the province have established 2,253 grassroots science and technology association organizations, and 20,000 mass scientific and technological research groups organized by production teams, workshops, and work sections, with more than 220,000 members. We already have a mass scientific research team and a group of worker-peasant scientists.

Science and technology association organizations and personnel at all levels throughout the province are, based on the characteristics of their respective regions, closely integrating with production and engaging in various scientific research experiments using various methods. In particular, the research and experimentation on the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture." For example, a lot of comparative experimental research work has been done in aspects such as cultivating new crop varieties, reasonable close planting density, appropriate depth of soil deep plowing, prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, irrigation technology, pig and sheep breeding, and tool reform. Facts have proved that People's Communes that attach importance to research in this area can propose specific production-increasing measures suitable for local conditions. The Shanwei Brigade of the Dunhuang People's Commune has carried out extensive cotton planting experiments and written the book "Compilation of Cotton Production Increase in Dunhuang," which theoretically summarizes cotton production increase measures and guides the county's cotton production increase efforts. The "Ten Women Research Group" of the Xiguan Production Team of the Shanhe People's Commune in Ning County conducted comparative experiments on 93 kinds of crops in a ten-mu experimental field this year and created new varieties through hybridization. They have already ensured that new varieties of major crops and new cultivation techniques are tested before being promoted and applied to large-field production. Problems encountered in large-field production are also brought to the experimental field for testing. The results of the experiments are used to guide large-field production, so that the pulse of large-field management beats with the pulse of the experimental field. In the technical innovation and technical revolution movements, the broad masses, with a spirit of continuous revolution, have created and improved many new tools, generally increasing work efficiency by one to dozens of times, greatly saving labor.

(II)

In recent years, the scientific and technological research work of the People's Communes in Gansu Province has achieved great success. In practice, we also have some experience on how to do this work well:

1.  We must adhere to putting politics in command and strengthening the leadership of the Party Committee. The process of scientific and technological development is also a process of fighting against various erroneous ideas. Erroneous ideas come from two aspects: some people believe that science is a foreign thing and that peasants cannot do it because they are clumsy; what peasants research is not academic and has little value. Among the peasant masses, some people also oppose scientific research and production, fearing that research will delay production. Strengthening the Party's specific leadership ensures encouragement and support for new things; it can criticize and refute all kinds of erroneous ideas and opinions, thereby educating the broad masses. Facts have proved that the peasant masses can not only carry out scientific research, but also have great potential. Because the working masses are practitioners of production and creators of science and technology, they can of course carry out scientific research. Conducting experimental fields is by no means a waste. If the experiment is successful and promoted and applied, the economic benefits will be very significant. Even the experimental field itself generally produces much more than the large fields.

2.  Closely integrate with production and serve production. The basic source of science is production practice, and production is the fundamental driving force for scientific progress. Without production, science cannot truly develop. Therefore, we must firmly establish the view that science serves production. This spring, the Jiaojiazhuang Commune in Yongchang conducted detailed investigations and research on the problem of winter wheat seedling death, found the causes of seedling death, summarized the experience, and proposed specific remedial measures, providing a set of technical measures for this year's winter wheat development. When the key problems in production are truly solved, scientific and technological work can win the support of the masses and achieve great development.

3.  Implement the "three-way combination" of leading cadres, the masses, and technical personnel, and launch mass movements. This is a good way to combine the leadership's strength with the masses' strength, and to combine the technical personnel's scientific and technological knowledge with the masses' practical experience. It is also an important method of implementing the Party's mass line and leading the movement onto the correct, scientific, and all-people track. In People's Communes that adopt this method, the work proceeds smoothly and the results are very outstanding. In the Mubo Production Team of the Quzi People's Commune in Huan County, the branch secretary Yao Zhengjie has been with the masses from beginning to end to jointly research the sorghum experimental field. Under the guidance of technical cadres and experienced production experts, the experimental results increased by four times compared with ordinary fields, and a set of high-yield sorghum experience was summarized.

4.  Establish scientific research organizations, organize professional teams, train worker-peasant experts, and establish research bases. This is one of the important keys to ensuring the smooth development of work. Therefore, the commune should establish a science and technology committee, and grassroots units such as production teams, factories, schools, and hospitals should set up science and technology leading groups to conscientiously study and implement the Party's policies. The commune establishes a scientific research institute, and the production team establishes a research group, widely absorbing the participation of the peasant masses to carry out specific research and experiments.

(III)

Now, the idea that the development of the national economy must be based on agriculture has armed the entire people. Running agriculture and grain production well has become the top priority of the entire Party and all the people. The current scientific and technological work of the People's Communes should do everything possible to serve the continuous increase in grain production and the development of agricultural production. Taking grain as the key link and the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" as the center, focusing closely on increasing grain production, extensively and deeply exploring the laws of production increase, and placing the focus of work on the following aspects:

(1) Clarify the main direction of attack. The "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" is a scientific summary of agricultural production experience by Comrade Mao Zedong over many years. It correctly summarizes the objective requirements for the normal growth of agricultural crops and the increase in production. Our task is to study how to implement the "Eight-Point Charter" in accordance with local conditions. At present, we must especially focus on studying how to use the latest technology and promote advanced experience to shorten agricultural time and increase yield per unit area. For example, the introduction and selection of improved varieties of early-maturing crops with short growing seasons, research on winter sowing and early germination of crops. In addition, we must study and solve scientific and technological problems such as the source of livestock feed, livestock feeding management, improving the reproduction rate, and preventing livestock diseases, develop animal husbandry, and promote the development of agricultural production. Saving labor is also an important issue in current agricultural production. To solve this problem, within the scope of science and technology, on the one hand, we must carry out experimental research on agricultural mechanization and semi-mechanization according to different regions and different natural conditions, and find solutions from labor tools. On the other hand, we must study and master operations research, rationally allocate labor, and do a good job in crop planting, land use, channel distribution, fertilizer transportation, and the planning of the distribution of wheat fields, processing plants, and breeding farms, so as to achieve the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical under the existing conditions.

(2) Vigorously carry out on-site technical activities. Various forms of on-site technical activities are active, proactive, closely collaborative, and more effective forms of activity for serving production. The grassroots science and technology associations of Gansu Province will widely organize technical guidance groups, promotion groups, advanced experience promotion teams, and service teams, etc., and use various lively forms to universally promote and summarize new technologies and experiences, and solve key problems in production in various regions, especially the current problems on the front line of agricultural production, and gradually make this work regular, institutionalized, and systematic.

(3) Extensively carry out mass theoretical summary activities and scientific and technological research group activities, and encourage workers, peasants, and soldiers to write papers. If they cannot write themselves, they should ask others to record. Through mass theoretical summaries, the advanced experiences and inventions and creations emerging from the technical revolution movement are conscientiously summarized and improved theoretically to further guide production.

In order to realize the continued leap forward in scientific and technological work and continuously increase grain production, scientific workers must improve their work style, go deep into the grassroots, go deep into the masses, and eat, live, labor, and discuss with the masses. Scientific workers must have a down-to-earth work style, maintain close ties with the masses, care about the lives of the masses, work hard, and overcome difficulties. Let us hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, under the leadership of the Party, bravely advance along our own path of science and technology!

    开展群众性科学活动为发展农业生产服务
    甘肃省科学技术委员会副主任　刘允中
    （一）
    人民公社大办科学技术事业，对于更好地贯彻执行发展国民经济以农业为基础的方针，迅速发展粮食生产，促进国民经济的飞跃发展，有着巨大的深远的意义。
    农业生产的对象是有生命的植物，在很大程度上受着自然条件的支配。复杂的、多方面的因素影响着农作物的生长发育，这些因素在目前来说，有些还是人力不能控制或是不能完全控制的。为了迅速提高农业生产水平，稳定和不断提高粮食产量，必须发展人民公社的科学技术事业，加强农业科学研究工作，使科学技术跟上生产，并抢先一步走在生产的前头，促进生产。
    甘肃省的科学技术部门，几年来，认真地贯彻执行党的发展科学技术事业的一整套两条腿走路的方针政策，因而全省的科学研究活动，蓬勃向前发展。从组织上说，从无到有，从小到大，由高到低，发展到现在，全省各人民公社、厂矿企业、机关学校，已经建立了基层科协组织二千二百五十三个，由生产队、车间、工段等组织的各种形式不同的群众性科学技术研究小组二万个，拥有会员二十二万多名。我们已经有了一支群众性的科学研究队伍和一批工农的科学家。
    全省各级科协组织和人员，正在根据本地区的特点，紧密结合生产，用各种方法，从事多项科学研究试验。特别是对农业“八字宪法”的研究和试验。例如，在培育作物新品种、合理密植幅度、土壤深翻适宜深度、防治病虫害、灌溉技术、养猪养羊、工具改革等方面，做了不少对比试验研究工作。事实证明，凡是重视这方面研究的人民公社，都能提出适合于本地区条件的具体增产措施。敦煌人民公社山危大队大搞植棉试验工作，写出了“敦煌棉花增产汇编”一书，从理论上总结了棉花增产的措施，指导全县棉花的增产工作。宁县山河人民公社西关生产队的“十女研究组”，今年在十亩试验田里，进行九十三种作物的对比试验，用杂交的方法创造新的品种。她们已经做到对主要作物新品种、新的耕作技术，都经过试验，然后推广应用到大田生产中去。在大田生产中碰到的问题，也都拿到试验田来试验，用试验结果指导大田生产，使大田管理的脉搏随着试验田的脉搏跳动。广大群众在技术革新和技术革命运动中，用不断革命的精神，创造和改进了许多新工具，一般地提高工效一倍到几十倍，大大节约了劳动力。
    （二）
    甘肃省人民公社的科学技术研究工作，几年来是取得了巨大成绩的。在实践中，对于如何做好这项工作，我们也有一些体会：
    一、必须坚持政治挂帅，加强党委领导。科学技术发展的过程，也就是同各种错误思想斗争的过程。错误思想来自两个方面：有的人认为，科学是洋东西，农民粗手笨脚搞不了；农民研究的东西，学术性不强，价值不大。在农民群众中间，也有人把科学研究和生产对立起来，怕研究科学，耽误生产。加强党的具体领导，就保证了对新鲜事物的鼓励和扶植；就可以批判、驳倒形形色色的错误思想和言论，从而教育广大群众。事实证明，农民群众不但能进行科学研究，而且大有可为。因为劳动群众是生产的实践者，也是科学技术的缔造者，当然可以进行科学研究。搞试验田也绝不是浪费。试验成功了，推广应用后，经济效益非常显著，就是试验田本身，一般地要比大田增产许多。
    二、密切结合生产，为生产服务。科学的基本来源是生产实践，生产是推动科学前进的根本动力，离开了生产，科学是不能真正有所发展的。因此，必须牢固地树立科学为生产服务的观点。今年春天，永昌焦家庄公社，针对冬麦死苗问题进行细致的调查研究，找出了死苗原因，总结了经验，提出了补救的具体办法，为今年发展冬麦提供了一套技术措施。真正解决了生产上的关键问题，科学技术工作也就能够得到群众的拥护，获得巨大的发展。
    三、实行领导干部、群众和技术人员三结合，大搞群众运动。这是把领导力量同群众的力量结合起来，把技术人员的科学技术知识同群众的实践经验结合起来的好办法。它又是贯彻执行党的群众路线，把运动引向正确的、科学的、全民的轨道上的一个重要方法。凡是采用这个方法的人民公社，工作就进行得很顺利，成绩也非常突出。环县曲子人民公社木钵生产队，培育高粱试验田，支部书记姚正杰自始至终和群众在一起共同研究，由技术干部和有丰富经验的生产能手指导，试验结果比一般田增产四倍，并总结出了一套高粱丰产经验。
    四、建立科学研究组织机构，组织专业队伍培养工农专家，建立研究基地。这是保证工作顺利开展的重要关键之一。因此，公社要成立科学技术委员会，生产队、工厂、学校、医院等基层单位要设立科学技术领导小组，认真研究和贯彻执行党的方针政策。公社建立科学研究所，生产队成立研究小组，广泛地吸收农民群众参加，具体进行研究试验。
    （三）
    现在，发展国民经济必须以农业为基础的思想，武装了全体人民；大办农业，大办粮食成了全党全民的头等重要的任务。当前人民公社的科学技术工作，应当千方百计地为不断提高粮食产量，发展农业生产服务。以粮为纲，以农业“八字宪法”为中心，紧紧围绕增产粮食，广泛深入地探索增产的规律，把工作重点放在下列几个方面：
    （一）明确主攻方向。农业“八字宪法”是毛泽东同志多年来对农业生产经验的科学总结，它正确地概括了农业作物正常生长和增加生产的客观要求。我们的任务就在于研究如何因地制宜地贯彻执行“八字宪法”。当前，尤其要着重研究如何使用最新技术和推广先进经验，以缩短农时，提高单位面积产量。例如，引进与选育生长期短的早熟作物的优良品种，作物冬播和提早发芽的研究。另外，要研究解决牲畜饲料来源，牲畜饲养管理，提高繁殖率，防止牲畜疫病等科学技术问题，发展畜牧业，以促进农业生产的发展。节约劳动力也是当前农业生产上的一个重要问题，要解决这一问题，在科学技术的范围内，一方面要根据不同地区、不同自然条件，进行农业机械化、半机械化的试验研究，从劳动工具上想办法，一方面要研究与掌握运筹学，合理调配劳动力，做好作物种植、土地利用、水渠分布、肥料运送，以及麦场、加工厂、饲养场分布的规划，使在现有条件下，达到多快好省的要求。
    （二）大搞技术上门活动。各种形式的技术上门活动，是积极主动、密切协作，更有效地为生产服务的活动形式。甘肃省的各基层的科协组织，将广泛地组织技术指导组、促进团、先进经验推广队和服务队等，用各种生动活泼的形式来普遍地推广与总结新的技术和经验，解决各地区生产中的关键问题，特别是当前农业生产第一线的问题，并且逐步要把这个工作经常化，制度化和系统化。
    （三）广泛开展群众性的理论总结活动和科学技术研究小组的活动，提倡工农群众写论文，不能自己写的就请别人记。通过群众性的理论总结，把技术革命运动中涌现出来的先进经验和发明创造，认真从理论上加以总结和提高，进一步指导生产。
    为了实现科学技术工作的继续跃进，使粮食产量不断增长，科学工作者必须改进工作作风，深入基层，深入群众，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。科学工作者必须具备踏踏实实的作风，密切联系群众，关心群众生活，埋头苦干，克服困难。让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想红旗，在党的领导下，沿着我国自己的科学技术道路奋勇前进！
