This paper Zhengzhou, 11th - In Yu County, Henan Province, most of the 277 public canteens of the May Fourth People's Commune have implemented a system of commune member representatives helping in the kitchen. Those that are doing a better job have achieved monthly planning for grain use, vegetable consumption, and coal burning, arrangements for three meals a day, daily clearing of accounts, settlement every five days, and monthly publication. According to statistics, 95% of the 277 canteens in the commune have reached first-class and second-class management levels. Among the more than 1,700 catering management personnel, 41% have been rated as "Three Good" (good planning and management, good service attitude, and good food hygiene) cooks and administrators.

Before the implementation of the system of commune member representatives helping in the kitchen, the public canteens of the May Fourth Commune had already generally established life and welfare committees with representatives from team leaders, food administrators, cooks, commune members, and life and welfare cadres. However, because life and welfare work involves a wide range of areas and complex matters, it is often impossible to conduct specific research on canteen management work separately. In order to effectively run the canteen, the commune Party committee, based on the opinions of commune members and the experience of some canteens in the past where food committee members took turns helping in the kitchen on a daily basis, decided to implement a system of commune member representatives helping in the kitchen throughout the commune, while appropriately reducing the number of cooks.

The specific method of the system of commune member representatives helping in the kitchen is as follows: the production team is the unit, and a commune member meeting is held once a month. Commune members elect people who are of good background, fair in their work, able to connect with the masses, pay attention to hygiene, love collective welfare undertakings, and have certain cooking management technical experience as commune member kitchen helper representatives. Each canteen elects six at a time, and each representative takes turns helping in the kitchen for five days. After the helper representatives are elected, they go to the work groups to collect opinions in a concentrated manner. Under the leadership of the life team leader and the canteen director, they work with catering management personnel, vegetable professional team leaders, and other relevant personnel to jointly study and formulate the canteen's monthly and semi-monthly grain use, vegetable consumption, and coal burning plans, and the main measures to improve canteen operation and management. During their duty, the helper representatives participate in catering management work, receive the same labor, the same remuneration, and the same study as the cooks and administrators, and participate in the cook and administrator group evaluation of work and scorekeeping. Through participating in catering management work during their duty and field production during their off-duty time, they publicize and implement the Party's principles and policies and specific regulations on running canteens well and caring for the lives of commune members to the catering management personnel and commune members; assist them in arranging the grain, vegetable, coal, oil, and salt plans for the five days, cooking and weighing grain according to the number of people; introduce the canteen management situation to the commune members, collect suggestions from commune members on improving canteen management and adjusting food at any time, and actively assist in solving problems in a timely manner. During handover, the duty representative, the administrator, and the cook jointly hand over accounts, objects, situations, and experience to the incoming representative. The life team leader and the canteen director are responsible for reporting the canteen management situation to the commune members at the next commune member meeting, and the administrator is responsible for announcing the accounts to the commune members.

Since the public canteens of the May Fourth Commune began implementing the system of commune member representatives helping in the kitchen this autumn, the atmosphere of democratic management of canteens has greatly increased. Commune members are proud to be elected as helper representatives, and consider helping run the canteen well as their own responsibility. Therefore, a new atmosphere has emerged in which everyone cares about the canteen and works together to run it well.

Zhai Ruisheng, Yao Baocang, Yao Huani and other six helper representatives of the second production team canteen of the Changzhuang Brigade, in order to ensure the completion of the tasks entrusted to them by the commune members, established a liaison convention among themselves, widely absorbed the opinions of the commune members, and studied and solved them one by one.

In promoting the system of commune member representatives helping in the kitchen in various canteens, in addition to making full use of this form, the Party committee and brigade Party branch of the May Fourth Commune vigorously publicized and implemented the Party's principles and policies on running canteens well to the masses through the commune member representatives, and educated the commune member representatives to lead by example, take the lead in their work, and unite the catering management personnel to improve canteen management, they also specifically organized the catering management personnel and helper representatives to study policies, sum up and exchange experiences, improve the ideological level and political level of the catering management personnel, and enhance their policy concept and mass viewpoint.

### 推行社员代表帮厨制度  五四公社群策群力办好食堂

    推行社员代表帮厨制度
    五四公社群策群力办好食堂
    本报郑州11日电　河南省禹县五四人民公社二百七十七个公共食堂，大部分实行了社员代表帮厨制度。其中执行较好的已经做到了用粮、吃菜、烧煤月月有计划，一天三餐有安排，账目一日一清，五日一结，一个月一公布。据统计，全社二百七十七个食堂中，已经有95％达到一类和二类管理水平。一千七百余名炊事管理人员中，有41％被评为“三好”（计划管理好，服务态度好，饭菜清洁卫生好）炊事员、管理员。
    五四公社的公共食堂，在实行社员代表帮厨制度以前，已经普遍建立了吸收有队长、伙食管理员、炊事员代表、社员代表和生活福利干部参加的生活福利委员会。但是，由于生活福利工作涉及面广、事情复杂，往往对食堂管理工作不能单独进行具体研究。为了切实把食堂办好，公社党委根据社员意见和有些食堂以往伙食委员按日轮流进食堂帮厨的经验，决定除各生产队选派一位称职能干的队干部担任生活队长专门负责管理生活外，在全社推行社员代表帮厨制度，同时适当减少炊事员。
    社员代表帮厨制度的具体作法是：以生产队为单位，每月召开一次社员会，由社员选举成分好、办事公道、能联系群众、讲究卫生、热爱集体福利事业和具有一定炊事管理技术经验的人为社员帮厨代表。每个食堂一次选举六个，每个代表轮流帮厨五天。帮厨代表选出后，便分头到作业组集中征求意见，在生活队长和食堂主任的主持下，与炊事管理人员、蔬菜专业队长等有关人员，共同研究订出食堂全月、分旬的用粮、吃菜、烧煤计划和改进食堂经营管理的主要措施。社员代表参加帮厨期间，与炊事员、管理员同劳动、同报酬、同学习，参加炊事员、管理员小组评工记分。他们通过值班期间参加炊事管理工作和不值班时间的田间生产，向炊事管理人员和社员宣传贯彻党对办好食堂，关心社员生活的方针政策和具体规定；协助他们安排五天内的粮、菜、煤、油、盐计划，按人做饭、称粮下锅；向社员介绍食堂管理情况，随时搜集社员对改进食堂管理和调剂饭菜建议，发现问题，及时向食堂反映并积极协助解决。交接班时，值班代表与管理员、炊事员共同向接班代表交账目，交实物，交情况，交经验。生活队长和食堂主任负责在下一次社员会上，向社员报告食堂管理情况，管理员负责向社员公布账目。
    五四公社的公共食堂，自从今年秋季开始实行社员代表帮厨制以来，民主管理食堂之风大兴。社员以当选帮厨代表为荣，以帮助办好食堂为自己的责任。因而出现了人人关心食堂，同心协力办好食堂的新气象。
    苌庄大队第二生产队食堂帮厨代表翟锐生、姚保仓、姚华妮等六人，为了保证完成社员委托的任务，互相间订立了联系公约，广泛吸收社员意见，一项一项研究解决。
    五四公社党委和大队党支部在各食堂推行社员代表帮厨制度中，除了充分利用这种形式，通过社员代表向群众大力宣传贯彻党对办好食堂的方针政策，和教育社员代表以身作则，带头工作，团结炊事管理人员改进食堂管理以外，还专门组织炊事管理人员和帮厨代表一块学习政策，总结交流经验，提高炊事管理人员的思想水平、政治水平和增强政策观念、群众观点。
