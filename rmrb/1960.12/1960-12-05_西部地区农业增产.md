    Increased Agricultural Production in Western Regions
    The proportion of agricultural output from the western regions of Poland in the country's total agricultural output is constantly increasing. Between 1955 and 1958, the average yield per hectare of the four major grains in the western regions increased by 1.5 quintals, reaching 15 quintals. During this period, the national average yield per hectare of the four major grains increased by 0.5 quintals, reaching 14.8 quintals.
    The province of Olëc achieved the best results, with an average yield of 17.4 quintals per hectare in 1958 and 19.6 quintals in 1959. In some areas of this province, the average yield increased by 3 quintals compared to pre-war levels. Due to the high level of agriculture, these areas have become a base for supplying seeds to neighboring provinces.

    西部地区农业增产
    波兰西部地区的农业产量在全国农业总产量中所占的比重正在不断增加。1955年至1958年期间，西部地区四种主要谷物每公顷平均产量增加了一点五公担，达到十五公担。全国在这一期间四种主要谷物每公顷平均产量增加了零点五公担，达到十四点八公担。
    奥列省的成绩最好，1958年每公顷平均产量为十七点四公担，1959年达到十九点六公担。这个省有些地区产量平均比战前增加三公担。由于高度的农业水平，这些地区成了向邻近各省供应种子的基地。
