    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 19th: Salumu, a member of the Congolese central government and Lumumba's assistant, strongly condemned yesterday upon his arrival in Cairo the U.S. imperialist plot to once again place the Congo under colonial rule.
    He pointed out that Mobutu and his mercenary army are financed by Americans, Belgians, and Britons in order to restore imperialism in the Congo. He said that Lumumba refused to sell out his country, while Mobutu and others greedily accepted imperialist money and sold out their country, showing no consideration for their fourteen million Congolese compatriots.
    He continued, saying that Mobutu and others have acquired large quantities of weapons in an attempt to subdue the Congolese people by force. However, their attempts will never succeed because Lumumba has the support of 90% of the Congolese people, and once the country restores democratic rule, Lumumba will surely return to power through the will of the people.
    He said that Lumumba wrote to him from his prison cell, asking him to go to Stanleyville to request Gizenga to form a cabinet, with Gizenga serving as acting prime minister. He continued, saying that therefore, the government in Stanleyville is a continuation of the former Leopoldville government, and it is the only legitimate government of the Congo.
    He also explained that the Stanleyville government will be fully responsible for the administration of the country. Salumu also said, "We will repel any attempt by the colonialists to forcibly occupy the Congo."
    Earlier, the United Front Party of Kasai Province, Congo, had sent a telegram to UAR President Nasser requesting support for the Lumumba government. The telegram stated:
  “We request firm intervention from all Asian and African countries to seek the release of Prime Minister Lumumba.”
    The telegram pointed out, “All imperialist policies are the same, and they should be condemned and despised by all African countries.”
    Xinhua News Agency, December 20th: According to TASS, London: The Secretariat of the World Peace Council issued a statement on the 19th regarding the situation in the Congo, calling on all peace advocates to take resolute action to strive for "the release of Lumumba and other officials of the legitimate government, the restoration of the normal activities of the parliament, the disarmament of Mobutu's mercenaries, and the cessation of all imperialist conspiracies and interference."
    The statement pointed out that the situation in the Congo has further deteriorated after the illegal arrest of the Prime Minister of the Republic of the Congo, Lumumba. Belgian military personnel and "technical experts" have flooded back into the Congo, and imperialist countries are plotting open military intervention in the Congo.
    The Secretariat of the World Peace Council emphasized that the situation in the Congo seriously threatens peace in Africa and the world.

    萨卢谬重申卢蒙巴政府是刚果唯一合法政府
    刚果人民终将击退帝国主义
    世界和平理事会号召制止帝国主义对刚果的军事干涉
    新华社开罗19日电　刚果中央政府成员、卢蒙巴助手萨卢谬昨天到达开罗时，强烈谴责美帝国主义企图把刚果重新置于殖民主义统治下的阴谋。
    他指出，蒙博托和他的雇佣军队是由美国人、比利时人和英国人出钱供养的，为的是在刚果恢复帝国主义。他说，卢蒙巴拒绝出卖他的国家，而蒙博托等人却贪得无厌地接受帝国主义的钱而出卖他们的国家，他们丝毫不考虑他们的一千四百万刚果同胞。
    他继续说，蒙博托等人取得大量的武器，企图用武力来使刚果人民屈服。但是，他们的企图决不会得逞，因为卢蒙巴获得90％的刚果国民的支持，一当这个国家恢复民主统治，卢蒙巴一定会通过人民的意志重新执政。
    他说，卢蒙巴从他的囚室里写信给他，要他前往斯坦利维尔要求基赞加成立一个内阁，并由基赞加担任代理总理。他继续说，因此，在斯坦利维尔的政府是前利奥波德维尔政府的继续，它是刚果唯一合法的政府。
    他还解释说，斯坦利维尔政府将对国家的行政负完全的责任。萨卢谬又说，我们将击退殖民主义者强行占领刚果的任何企图。
    早些时候，刚果开赛省统一阵线党曾打电报给阿联总统纳赛尔要求支持卢蒙巴政府。电报中说：
  “我们要求来自所有亚非国家的坚决干预，以谋求释放卢蒙巴总理。”
    电报指出，“一切帝国主义的政策都是一样的，它们应该遭到所有非洲国家的谴责和蔑视”。
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社伦敦讯：世界和平理事会秘书处19日就刚果局势发表声明，号召所有和平拥护者采取坚决行动，争取“释放卢蒙巴和合法政府的其他官员，恢复议会的正常活动，解除蒙博托雇佣兵的武装，并且制止帝国主义的一切阴谋和干涉”。
    声明指出，在刚果共和国总理卢蒙巴被非法逮捕后，刚果的局势已经更加恶化。比利时军事人员和“技术专家”重新充斥刚果，帝国主义国家正在策划对刚果的公开的军事干涉。
    世界和平理事会秘书处强调，刚果的局势严重地威胁了非洲和全世界的和平。
