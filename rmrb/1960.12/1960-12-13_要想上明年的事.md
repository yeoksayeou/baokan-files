    "Thinking About Next Year's Matters"
    Xie Zuozu
    The Zengjia Production Team of the Wuzhangyuan Commune in Zhouzhi County, Shaanxi, led by Comrade Du Xinxu, had the highest yields in the surrounding area in 1958, regardless of the crop. Consequently, some commune members became overly complacent. Comrade Du Xinxu said:
    "Although we harvested a good amount of wheat this year, we didn't meet our target. We need to study where our measures were insufficient, and we can't repeat the same mistakes next year. We must strive for 800 catties."
    The commune members listened and said admiringly, "Hey, you're already thinking about next year's matters!"
    (From the People's Daily, November 13, second page)
    "Thinking about next year's matters!" That’s excellent. This is precisely the true character of a revolutionary!
    Revolution means transforming the world. For us revolutionaries, the cause of transforming the world is endless. Therefore, we never rest on our laurels in the face of achievements, never content with the status quo, but further raise higher demands, "Next year cannot be the same!"
    When we think of tomorrow, of next year, we are filled with confidence and hope. Our ultimate goal is to realize communism. All the work we are doing now—no matter how big or small—is for the communism of tomorrow, and is carried out under the glorious light of the great ideal of communism. A revolutionary stands firmly on the "realistic" ground, works on "realistic" tasks, but must not forget tomorrow in his heart at every moment. Forgetting the ultimate goal will turn us into political mediocrities. We must be like Du Xinxu, in this year, "thinking about next year's matters"; "next year's matters" are this year's ideals, next year's reality, and when next year comes, we must think about the year after next. This means never standing still, always looking ahead.
    Lenin once exclaimed in 1905, "Dare to dream!" Some people are unwilling and dare not to "dream." They are the donkey-like figures ridiculed by Mayakovsky, who only care about lowering their heads to graze, only seeing what is in front of them, not seeing what is above them.
    Of course, our dreams are not detached from reality or wild fantasies, but a combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. On the one hand, we are down-to-earth, working hard, and calmly analyzing; on the other hand, we have a long-term vision, set lofty aspirations, and have great ambitions. We must resolutely oppose those who have no interest in and no analysis of the current work and difficulties, but devote themselves to impractical fantasies. Next year is this year's next year, the future is the present's future. Throwing away this year means there will be no next year, throwing away the present means there will be no future.
    We must not only earnestly do the work of "this year" but also "think about next year's matters."

    “要想上明年的事”
    谢作祖
    杜新绪同志领导的陕西盩厔县五丈原公社曾家生产队，在1958年，不管哪一样，产量在周围都是最高的。因而有些社员过分得意，杜新绪同志说：
    “虽然今年麦子打得不少，可是没达到咱们的指标。要研究一下，是啥地方措施不到，明年可不能还是这些，要向八百斤上进。”
    社员们听了非常敬佩地说：“嘿，你倒又想上明年的事了！”
    （《人民日报》11月13日第二版）
    “想上明年的事了！”好得很。这正是一个革命者的本色！
    革命就是改造世界。对于我们革命者来说，改造世界的事业是永远没有止境的。因此，我们在已经取得的成就面前从不踌躇满志，从不满足现状，而是进一步提出更高的要求，“明年可不能还是这些！”
    当我们一想到明天、明年，就会满怀信心和希望。我们的最终目的是实现共产主义，我们当前所作的一切工作——无论巨细，都是为了明天的共产主义，都是在共产主义的伟大理想的光辉照耀下进行的。一个革命者脚踏的是“现实”的实地，手干的是“现实”的工作，但心里却时时刻刻分分秒秒不能忘掉明天。忘掉了最终目的，就要变成政治上的庸人。我们要像杜新绪那样，在今年，要“想上明年的事”；“明年的事”，是今年的理想，是明年的现实，而到了明年，又要想上明年之明年的事。这就是说，永远不原地踏步，两眼总是朝前看。
    列宁在1905年曾经大声疾呼：“要幻想！”有些人就是不愿意、不敢于“幻想”，他们是马雅可夫斯基所讥笑的那种只顾低着脑袋啃草的驴子式的人物，他们只看到眼下，看不到头上。
    自然，我们的幻想，并不是脱离实际的胡思乱想，而是把革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义结合起来，一方面，我们脚踏实地，埋头苦干，冷静分析，另一方面，高瞻远瞩，树雄心立大志。那种对现实的工作和困难，没有兴趣，没有分析，而一心驰鹜于不切实际的空想，我们是要坚决反对的。明年是今年的明年，将来是现在的将来，扔掉今年也就没有明年，扔掉现在也就没有将来。
    我们既要切实干“今年”的工作，又要“想上明年的事”。
