Xinhua News Agency, Havana, December 1st. This afternoon, the funeral of Major Manuel Fajardo, a militia leader of Escambray, Cuba, was held in Manzanillo, Oriente Province. He sacrificed himself on November 29 while searching for counter-revolutionaries in the aforementioned area.

President Dorticos, Premier Castro, and other members of the Cuban government attended the funeral. Countless workers, peasants, students, women, soldiers, and militiamen mournfully and solemnly carried the remains from the home of this revolutionary martyr to the burial site.

In his speech in front of the martyr's tomb, Premier Castro praised Major Fajardo's achievements during his lifetime. He said, "Fajardo's name will always be felt with affection." Castro emphasized that the criminals who killed Fajardo were primarily thugs from the Pentagon and the US intelligence agencies, who dropped weapons to the counter-revolutionaries in Escambray to resist the clearing operations of the peasant militia.

Castro also said, "We are saddened by the sacrifice of a comrade who was fulfilling his duty, but those who attempt to hinder the progress of our people will have to face a disgraceful execution."

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, November 30th. The Information Bureau of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces issued an announcement today, announcing the sacrifice of Major Manuel Fajardo, a farmer militia leader of Camagüey Province, in the battle to search for armed counter-revolutionaries.

The announcement said that on the evening of November 29, when five counter-revolutionaries were transferring from the city of Trinidad to Cienfuegos City through the jungle with a bag of weapons, Major Fajardo led some people to the scene of the incident to search and arrested two counter-revolutionaries. Major Fajardo was shot and killed in the process of pursuing the counter-revolutionaries. His body has been transported to Manzanillo, where a funeral will be held for him.

Before the victory of the Cuban Revolution, Fajardo was a famous surgeon. He fought heroically in the anti-dictatorial struggle in the Sierra Maestra mountains. He was deeply loved by the people.
