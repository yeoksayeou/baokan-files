    We Must Resolutely and Thoroughly Implement the Party's Policies
    Wu De
    Policy is the basis for a political party's actions. With correct policies, the entire Party can have correct actions, defeat the enemy, overcome difficulties, and achieve victory in revolution and construction. Conversely, without correct policies, or even with correct policies that cannot be correctly implemented, the victory of the revolution and construction will be delayed, or even suffer temporary setbacks. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong taught us that the task of leading organs is to understand the situation and grasp policies. He said: "Policy is the starting point of all actual actions of a revolutionary party and is manifested in the process and outcome of action. Any action of a revolutionary party is the implementation of policy. It is either implementing correct policies or implementing wrong policies; it is either consciously or blindly implementing some kind of policy." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol. IV, p. 1284. Subsequent quotations from this volume will only be marked with the page number.) To educate the entire Party to deeply understand the importance of policy, Comrade Mao Zedong further pointed out that "policy and strategy are the life of the Party, and leading comrades at all levels must pay full attention and never be careless." "Only when the Party's policies and strategies are all on the right track will the Chinese revolution be possible to win." (p. 1296) It can be seen that policy is a major issue related to the success or failure of revolution and construction.
    Party policies are divided into general policies and specific policies. The general policy determines the overall direction of a revolutionary stage, and we usually call this general policy the general line. Specific policies in various tasks are specific guidelines and measures formulated to achieve the general line or general policy. These policies are subordinate to the Party's line and serve the Party's line. To guide the revolutionary struggle, a correct line is not enough, and correct specific policies are also necessary. Without a general line, the direction of advance will be lost in the process of revolutionary struggle; similarly, without specific policies, the general line will be empty talk. Policy is determined by the line. During the period when right-leaning or "left"-leaning opportunist lines dominated our Party's history, the reason why their policies were wrong was primarily due to the errors of their lines. The Party Central Committee, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, formulated correct lines at every stage of our country's revolution and, based on the general line, formulated a series of important and correct policies. However, if errors or deviations occur in the implementation of policies, the cause of revolution and construction will also suffer undue losses. Therefore, it is necessary to correctly understand the relationship between the Party's line and policies, and to correctly implement the Party's policies in actual work. Only by fully understanding the Party's policies from the Party's line, deeply understanding the basis for formulating the Party's policies, and understanding the overall situation and overall tasks in each revolutionary stage, can we truly understand the essence of the Party's policies and improve the consciousness of implementing policies. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, "If we truly forget our Party's general line and general policy, we will be blind, incomplete, and unclear revolutionaries, and we will lose our way, waver from left to right, and delay our work when we implement specific work lines and specific policies." (p. 1314) This means that the line must be correct, the policies must be correct, and they must be correctly implemented. All achievements in work are the result of the correct implementation of the Party's policies, and errors in work are a manifestation of violating the Party's policies.
    The Party's policies are formulated based on the level of social productive forces in a certain period, the development of the class struggle situation and the changes in the balance of class forces, and the degree of awareness and organization of the masses. The development and changes in the revolutionary situation require the formulation of new policies that are adapted to this realistic revolutionary situation. Comrade Mao Zedong was good at discerning all the developments and changes in the revolutionary situation, good at discovering all the new things and new problems that appeared in the mass movement, and always stood at the forefront of the revolutionary development situation, formulating new policies suitable for the new situation without missing the opportunity, and guiding the revolutionary movement to continuously advance victoriously. In the stage of the democratic revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong formulated a correct line, and based on this line, he formulated various specific policies and strategies regarding land reform, industry and commerce, the united front, Party rectification, and work in new areas. The victory of the Chinese democratic revolution was precisely the result of the correct implementation of the Party's policies. After the victory of the democratic revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong promptly formulated the general line for socialist revolution and socialist construction, and a series of specific policies adapted to it. When the new social organizational form of the people's commune appeared, Comrade Mao Zedong immediately analyzed and summarized it, and based on the theory of productive forces and relations of production, the economic base and the superstructure, formulated a set of systematic policies related to the people's commune, such as the three-level ownership system based on the production team, thereby guiding the people's commune to embark on the road of consolidation and sound development, and finding the best social organizational form for building socialism and transitioning to communism in the future. Obviously, to correctly understand and implement the Party's policies, it is necessary to grasp the spirit of combining the theory of continuous revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development, correctly understand the situation of the revolutionary struggle, and neither lag behind the objective situation nor transcend the stage of revolutionary development. A certain stage of social development has a correct policy adapted to it. Policies that were correct in the past may not be applicable today due to changes in circumstances; similarly, policies that are applicable to future society are also not in line with the actual situation if they are used prematurely today. Of course, in the previous stage of the revolution, we should also consciously prepare the necessary conditions for the next stage of the revolution.
    The Party's policies are the concrete manifestation of the combination of Marxism-Leninism and our country's revolution and construction, and are the embodiment of Mao Zedong Thought in various tasks. It is the basis and guide for all cadres to carry out their work. The implementation of the Party's policies must be carried out with a firm attitude, without any hesitation or wavering. Of course, the correct implementation of the Party's policies must proceed from reality. The so-called reality is the specific situation at that time and place. Only by studying these situations clearly and determining appropriate steps based on these situations can the Party's policies be better implemented. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Deciding on work policies according to the actual situation is the most basic working method that all Communist Party members must firmly remember. The reason why we have made mistakes is that we have departed from the actual situation at that time and place and subjectively decided on our own work policies. This should be taken as a lesson by all comrades." (p. 1306) An important reason why "left" or right errors occur in the implementation of policies is the lack of in-depth investigation and research, and the failure to proceed from reality, thus either mistaking the opinions of a few backward elements among the masses as the opinions of the broad masses, ideologically lagging behind the situation and the masses, committing tailism errors or right errors; or exceeding the scope permitted by objective conditions, exceeding the degree of awareness of the masses, and violating the principle of voluntary participation by the masses, committing commandism or "left" errors. Correctly implementing policies requires carrying out a two-line struggle, opposing "left" or right deviations. To avoid making "left" or right errors in the implementation of policies, in addition to seriously studying and researching the Party's line and policies and improving theoretical levels, an important method is to frequently go deep into reality, deep into the masses, systematically conduct investigation and research, especially to carefully and meticulously listen to the various opinions of the masses, and use the method of class analysis to specifically analyze the trends of various classes.
    The Party's policies are a unity of the interests of the state and the interests of the masses, the long-term interests and immediate interests of the masses, and the overall interests and local interests, and are a complete summary of the correct opinions of the masses. "From the masses, to the masses" is our Party's consistent leadership method. Our Party's various policies are precisely formulated by concentrating the opinions of the masses, analyzing and improving them. To ensure the correct implementation of the Party's policies, it is necessary to bring the Party's policies to the broad masses, so that they are grasped by the masses, and in the process of implementing policies, to enable cadres to be supervised by the masses. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Our policies should not only be known to the leaders and cadres, but also to the broad masses." "When the masses know the truth and have a common purpose, they will work together wholeheartedly." "The basic principle of Marxism-Leninism is to make the masses realize their own interests and unite to fight for their own interests." (p. 1317) Comrade Mao Zedong also said, "Being good at turning the Party's policies into the actions of the masses, being good at making every one of our movements and every struggle understood and grasped not only by leading cadres but also by the broad masses is a Marxist-Leninist leadership art. The boundary of whether our work makes mistakes or not lies here." (p. 1318) Here, Comrade Mao Zedong made a profound exposition of the relationship between the Party's policies and the masses, and regarded whether the Party's policies are understood and grasped by the masses as the boundary of whether mistakes are made in the work. Revolution is the collective cause of the masses and must rely on the broad masses to complete it; and the masses need the leadership of the Party. The leadership of the Party is mainly realized through the Party's policies. Our ideological mobilization of the masses is also mainly based on policies. We must fully believe that the broad masses are capable of understanding and grasping policies. Countless past experiences have proved that only by handing over the Party's policies to the masses and letting them be grasped by the masses can the enthusiasm of the broad masses be fully mobilized, so that the masses, under the leadership of the Party, can consciously strive to realize the Party's policies, and turn the Party's policies into an invincible material force.
    To enable the Party's policies to be grasped by the masses, it is necessary to frequently and faithfully publicize and explain the Party's policies to the broad masses, promptly listen to the opinions and demands of the masses, check the implementation of policies, and overcome the shortcomings in the implementation of policies. Those practices of not listening enough to the opinions of the masses, especially not willing to listen to different opinions, acting arbitrarily, and affecting the enthusiasm of the masses must be corrected. To correct these shortcomings, it is necessary to emphasize among the broad cadres the need to carefully listen to the opinions of the masses and consciously accept the supervision of the masses. We must never refuse to listen to the opinions of the masses and cover up the shortcomings in our work because the masses may have some incorrect opinions; and it is even more impermissible to adopt an attitude of ignoring or even retaliating against the opinions of the masses. It should be understood that cadres are the bridge for implementing the Party's policies among the masses, and the Party's policies are implemented to the masses through the cadres. If the cadres' work style is not good, it will seriously affect the correct implementation of the policies, because cadres with a bad work style cannot gain the trust of the masses. Therefore, cadres must consult with the masses on everything and listen to their opinions. No matter what opinions the masses have, they must listen patiently and carefully, and then analyze and treat them differently. Correct ones should be followed, and incorrect ones should be patiently persuaded and explained.
    Many comrades often only pay attention to tasks, but do not pay attention to policies, and some even oppose policies and tasks. They do not understand that the Party's policies in a certain period serve the Party's political tasks in a certain period. Policies and tasks are consistent. Only by correctly implementing the Party's policies can tasks be completed satisfactorily. Therefore, implementing the Party's policies is the primary task of all cadres. In fact, the tasks these comrades are talking about are just the indicators of various tasks. Of course, the indicators of various tasks must also be strived to be completed. Correctly implementing policies and widely mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses are reliable guarantees for the smooth completion of various work indicators. Only by correctly implementing the policies and satisfactorily completing the work indicators can it be considered as completing the work task. Completing specific work indicators in violation of policies cannot be considered as completing the work task. Of course, some leading organs, due to the existence of subjectivism and bureaucracy, only assign tasks but do not assign policies and methods, and demand too high and too urgent for specific tasks, which also creates some difficulties for the cadres below. This should be resolved by improving the leadership style, and we must never oppose tasks and policies because of this.
    The Party's policies are the fundamental guarantee for revolutionary victory and successful construction. Without correct policies, or if policies are not implemented correctly, it is impossible to achieve the complete victory of the revolution and great achievements in construction. We study and research the Party's policies, and implement the Party's policies, which is to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in actual work. Combining with the current work, seriously studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works, and further improving the Marxist-Leninist ideological level of all Party cadres will enable the broad cadres to better implement the Party's policies, hold high the three red banners of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune, and accelerate the victorious advance of our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction.

    必须坚决、彻底地执行党的政策
    吴德
    政策是一个政党行动的根据。有了正确的政策，全党才可能有正确的行动，才会打倒敌人，克服困难，取得革命和建设的胜利。反之，如果没有正确的政策，或虽有正确的政策，而不能正确地实现这种政策，就会推迟革命和建设胜利的期限，或者竟使它遭受暂时的失败。所以，毛泽东同志教导我们，领导机关的任务就是了解情况，掌握政策。他说：“政策是革命政党一切实际行动的出发点，并且表现于行动的过程和归宿。一个革命政党的任何行动都是实行政策。不是实行正确的政策，就是实行错误的政策；不是自觉地，就是盲目地实行某种政策。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷第1284页。以下引语凡引自本卷的只注明页数）为了教育全党深刻认识政策的重要性，毛泽东同志又进一步地指出，“政策和策略是党的生命，各级领导同志务必充分注意，万万不可粗心大意。”“只有党的政策和策略全部走上正轨，中国革命才有胜利的可能。”（第1296页）可见，政策是关系到革命和建设成败的重大问题。
    党的政策，分为总的政策和具体政策。总的政策是确定一个革命阶段的总的方向的，通常我们称这种总的政策为总的路线。各项工作中的具体政策，则是为了实现总路线或总政策而制订的具体方针和具体措施。这些政策是服从于党的路线，服务于党的路线的。指导革命斗争，有了正确的路线还不够，还必须有正确的具体政策。没有总的路线，在革命斗争过程中就会迷失前进的方向；同样的，如果没有具体的政策，总的路线就会落空。政策决定于路线。我党历史上右倾或“左”倾机会主义路线占统治地位的时期，其政策之所以错误，首先是由于其路线的错误而产生的。以毛泽东同志为首的党中央在我国革命各个阶段都制定了正确的路线，并根据总的路线，制定了一系列重要的正确的政策。但是如果执行政策发生了错误或偏向，也会使革命和建设事业受到不应有的损失。因此，必须正确理解党的路线和政策的关系，并且在实际工作中正确执行党的政策。也只有从党的路线上来充分地认识党的政策，深刻理解制订党的政策的依据，理解每一个革命阶段中的总的形势和总的任务，才能真正理解党的政策的实质，提高执行政策的自觉性。毛泽东同志指出，“如果真正忘记了我党的总路线和总政策，我们就将是一个盲目的不完全的不清醒的革命者，在我们执行具体工作路线和具体政策的时候，就会迷失方向，就会左右摇摆，就会贻误我们的工作。”（第1314页）这就是说，路线要对，政策也要对，还要执行得对。工作中的一切成就，是正确执行党的政策的结果，工作中的错误，是违反党的政策的表现。
    党的政策是根据一定时期社会生产力的水平，根据阶级斗争形势的发展和阶级力量对比关系的变化，根据群众的觉悟程度和组织程度而制订的。革命形势的发展变化，要求制订同这种现实的革命形势相适应的新的政策。毛泽东同志善于洞察革命形势的一切发展变化，善于发现群众运动中所出现的一切新事物和新问题，总是站在革命发展形势的前面，不失时机地制订出适合于新形势的新政策，指导革命运动不断胜利前进。在民主革命阶段，毛泽东同志制订了一条正确的路线，根据这条路线，又制订了关于土地改革，关于工商业，关于统一战线，关于整党，关于新区工作等等方面的各项具体政策和策略。中国民主革命的胜利，正是正确执行党的政策的结果。在民主革命胜利后，毛泽东同志又及时地制订了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的总路线，及与之相适应的一系列的具体政策。当人民公社这种新的社会组织形式出现后，毛泽东同志又立即加以分析总结，根据生产力和生产关系、经济基础和上层建筑的理论，制订了以生产队为基础的三级所有制等有关人民公社的一套系统的政策，从而指导人民公社走上巩固和健全发展的道路，为建设社会主义和将来过渡到共产主义找到了最好的社会组织形式。显然，要正确理解和执行党的政策，必须掌握不断革命论和革命发展阶段论相结合的精神，正确地认识革命斗争的形势，既不落后于客观形势，又不超越革命发展的阶段。一定的社会发展阶段，有一定的与之相适应的正确的政策。以前是正确的政策，由于情况发生变化，有些在今天就不一定适用；同样，适用于将来社会的政策，过早地在今天就拿来使用，也是不合乎实际情况的。当然，在革命的前一阶段，也应当自觉地为革命的下一阶段准备必要的条件。
    党的政策是马克思列宁主义和我国革命和建设相结合的具体表现，是毛泽东思想在各项工作中的体现。它是一切干部进行工作的依据和指针。执行党的政策必须采取坚定不移的态度，不能有任何犹豫或动摇。当然，正确执行党的政策必须从实际出发。所谓实际，就是当时当地的具体情况。只有把这些情况都研究清楚，并根据这些情况确定适当的步骤，党的政策才能更好地贯彻执行。毛泽东同志说，“按照实际情况决定工作方针，这是一切共产党员所必须牢牢记住的最基本的工作方法。我们所犯的错误，研究其发生的原因，都是由于我们离开了当时当地的实际情况，主观地决定自己的工作方针。这一点，应当引为全体同志的教训。”（第1306页）执行政策所以会发生“左”的或右的错误，很重要的一点，就是缺乏深入的调查研究，不从实际出发，因而或者把群众中少数落后分子的意见误认为广大群众的意见，思想落后于形势，落后于群众，犯了尾巴主义错误或右的错误；或者超过客观条件所许可的范围，超过群众的觉悟程度，违反群众自愿的原则，犯了命令主义或“左”的错误。正确执行政策必须进行两条战线的斗争，反对“左”的或右的偏向。在执行政策中要避免犯“左”的或右的错误，除了认真学习和研究党的路线和政策，提高理论水平之外，一个很重要的方法，就是经常深入实际，深入群众，系统地进行调查研究，特别是要认真地细心地听取群众的各种意见，运用阶级分析的方法，具体分析各阶层的动向。
    党的政策，是国家利益和群众利益、群众的长远利益和眼前利益、整体利益和局部利益的统一，是群众正确意见的完满概括。“从群众中来，到群众中去”，是我党一贯的领导方法。我党各项政策正是集中了群众意见加以分析提高而制订的。而要保证党的政策的正确执行，又必须使党的政策同广大群众见面，为群众所掌握，并且在执行政策的过程中，使干部得到群众的监督。毛泽东同志说，“我们的政策，不光要使领导者知道，干部知道，还要使广大的群众知道。”“群众知道了真理，有了共同的目的，就会齐心来做。”“马克思列宁主义的基本原则，就是要使群众认识自己的利益，并且团结起来，为自己的利益而奋斗。”（第1317页）毛泽东同志又说，“善于把党的政策变为群众的行动，善于使我们的每一个运动，每一个斗争，不但领导干部懂得，而且广大的群众都能懂得，都能掌握，这是一项马克思列宁主义的领导艺术。我们的工作犯不犯错误，其界限也在这里。”（第1318页）这里，毛泽东同志对党的政策同群众的关系作了深刻的论述，而且把党的政策是否为群众所了解和掌握，看作工作中犯不犯错误的界限。革命是群众的集体事业，必须依靠广大群众来完成；而群众又需要党的领导。党的领导，主要是依靠党的政策来实现的。我们所说的对群众的思想发动，也主要是依靠政策。必须完全相信，广大群众是能够理解和掌握政策的。过去无数的经验证明，只有把党的政策交给群众，为群众所掌握，才能充分调动广大群众的积极性，使群众在党的领导下，为实现党的政策而自觉地努力奋斗，把党的政策变成为不可战胜的物质力量。
    要使党的政策为群众所掌握，必须经常地原原本本地向广大群众宣传和解释党的政策，及时听取群众的意见和要求，检查执行政策的情况，克服执行政策中的缺点。那些听取群众的意见不够，特别是不愿意听取不同的意见，独断专行，影响群众的积极性的做法，是必须改正的。为了改正这些缺点，必须在广大干部中，强调细心听取群众的意见，自觉地接受群众的监督，决不能因为群众可能有某些不正确的意见，而拒绝听取群众的意见，掩盖自己工作中的缺点；更不允许对群众的意见采取不闻不问，置之不理，以至打击报复的态度。应该了解，干部是在群众中贯彻党的政策的桥梁，党的政策是通过干部贯彻到群众中去的。干部作风不好，就会严重地影响政策的正确贯彻，因为作风不好的干部是不能取得群众的信任的。因此干部必须遇事同群众商量，听取群众意见。不管群众有些什么意见，都要耐心地认真地听完，然后加以分析，区别对待。正确的照办，不正确的加以耐心的说服解释。
    许多同志常常只重视任务，而不注意政策，有的甚至把政策和任务对立起来。他们不了解，党在一定时期的政策，是为党在一定时期的政治任务服务的。政策和任务是一致的。只有正确执行党的政策，才能完满地完成任务。因此，贯彻执行党的政策，正是所有干部的头等任务。其实，这些同志所说的任务，只是各项工作的指标。当然，各项工作的指标也是必须努力完成的。正确地贯彻政策，广泛地发挥群众的积极性，正是顺利地完成各项工作指标的可靠保证。也只有正确地贯彻执行了政策，又完满地完成了工作指标，才能算是完成了工作任务。违反政策而完成具体工作指标，是不能算完成工作任务的。当然，有的领导机关由于存在着主观主义和官僚主义的作风，只交代任务，不交代政策和办法，对具体任务要求过高过急，也给下边干部造成一些困难。这要从改进领导作风上来解决，决不能因此而把任务和政策对立起来。
    党的政策是革命胜利和建设成功的根本保证。没有正确的政策，或者对政策执行得不正确，就不可能取得革命的全部胜利和建设的伟大成绩。我们学习和研究党的政策，执行党的政策，就是在实际工作中学习和运用毛泽东思想。结合当前工作，认真学习毛泽东同志的著作，进一步提高全党干部的马克思列宁主义思想水平，就会使广大干部更好地执行党的政策，更高地举起总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗，加速推动我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业胜利前进。（摘自吉林《奋进》1960年第十一、十二期合刊）
