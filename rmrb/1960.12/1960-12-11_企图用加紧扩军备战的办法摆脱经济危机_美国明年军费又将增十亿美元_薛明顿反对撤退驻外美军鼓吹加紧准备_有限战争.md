　　Attempting to Get Rid of the Economic Crisis by Intensifying Military Expansion and War Preparations
    U.S. Military Spending to Increase by Another $1 Billion
    Symington Opposes Withdrawing U.S. Troops Stationed Abroad, Advocates Stepping Up Preparations for "Limited War"

    (Reported by this newspaper) In the face of the deepening economic crisis, the American ruling group is attempting to get rid of its difficulties by intensifying military expansion and war preparations. According to the *New York Herald Tribune*, the U.S. military has increased its huge military budget for 1961-1962 by $1 billion, bringing the total military spending to over $42 billion.

    The newspaper reported from Washington on the 7th that the U.S. military is adding to its military budget to step up preparations for nuclear war and "limited war." The report noted that the army accounts for the largest proportion of military spending in the current year and the new year, stating that future military development in the United States is "shifting emphasis from aircraft to missiles, and more emphasis on the ability to fight limited wars."

    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 9th: Symington, a key military advisor to U.S. President-elect Kennedy, said at a press conference on the 8th that he opposes withdrawing any U.S. troops from foreign territories.

    The former Secretary of the Air Force under the Truman administration said, "I don't know anyone who wants to bring (U.S.) troops stationed abroad back." He also expressed disagreement with Eisenhower's recent measures to reduce the number of dependents accompanying U.S. troops stationed abroad.

    Referring to a plan he submitted to Kennedy a few days ago to reorganize the U.S. Department of Defense, Symington reiterated that the plan is "not for saving money," but to improve the efficiency of the U.S. military machine and use the approximately $8 billion that might be saved by reorganizing the Department of Defense to "obtain more effective armaments" so that the U.S. "defense" can meet the requirements of the "nuclear space age." He also said that he is in favor of perfecting and using the "B-70" bomber, which is "three times the speed of sound."

    Symington also advocated that the United States should step up preparations for "limited wars."

    企图用加紧扩军备战的办法摆脱经济危机
    美国明年军费又将增十亿美元
    薛明顿反对撤退驻外美军鼓吹加紧准备“有限战争”
    本报讯　在经济危机日益加深的情况下，美国统治集团企图用加紧扩军备战的手段摆脱困难。据《纽约先驱论坛报》透露，美国军方已把1961—1962年度的庞大军事预算增加十亿美元，使军费总数将超过四百二十亿美元。
    这家报纸在7日从华盛顿发回的一条消息中说，美国军方追加军事预算，是为了加紧准备发动核战争和“有限战争”。消息谈到陆军在本年度和新的年度的军费中所占比例最大时说，美国今后的军事发展是“不再强调飞机而强调导弹，以及更多地强调打有限战争的能力。”
    新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：美国当选总统肯尼迪的主要军事顾问薛明顿8日在记者招待会上说，他反对从外国领土上撤回任何美国军队。
    这个杜鲁门政府时期的空军部长说，“我不知道有谁希望把（驻在外国的美国）军队调回来”。他还表示不同意艾森豪威尔最近采取的要减少驻外美军随军家属的措施。
    在谈到他几天前向肯尼迪提交的一份改组美国国防部的计划时，薛明顿再次强调说，这项计划“不是为了省钱”，而是要提高美国军事机器的效率，并把因改组国防部而可能节省出来的大约八十亿美元用来“取得更为有效的军备”，使美国的“防务”适应“核空间时代”的要求。他还说，他赞成使“三倍于音速”的“B—70”轰炸机趋于完善并加以使用。
    薛明顿还鼓吹美国要加紧准备“有限战争”。
