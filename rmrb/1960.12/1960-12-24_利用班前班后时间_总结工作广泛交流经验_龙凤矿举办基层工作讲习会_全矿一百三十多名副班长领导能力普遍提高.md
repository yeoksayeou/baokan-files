Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, December 23rd: The Longfeng Coal Mine in Fushun held a grassroots work experience lecture meeting, effectively improving the work ability and leadership level of grassroots cadres through the method of "everyone summarizing, everyone introducing, everyone learning."

More than 90% of the grassroots cadres at Longfeng Mine who command production day and night with the shift - the deputy squad leaders - have been newly promoted from workers. These deputy squad leaders are rich in practical production experience and full of drive, but generally lack experience in organizing and leading production. The grassroots work experience lecture meeting held by the mine's Party committee was a measure taken to quickly improve the leadership level of these cadres. At the lecture meeting, in addition to the cadres responsible for the Party committee and administration explaining the domestic and international situation and current tasks, as well as the responsibilities of the deputy squad leaders, special emphasis was placed on organizing grassroots cadres to summarize their own work experience, using practical examples from their own personal experience, and exchanging ideas with each other through reports, seminars, discussions, and other forms. The mine first started with direct production units, organizing 136 deputy squad leaders from nine departments, including mining areas and tunneling coal excavation, to study during their pre-shift and post-shift spare time. Before the meeting, the mine leaders helped several excellent deputy squad leaders who had consistently had good production and safety records in the past, such as Chen Yong of the Dalian Pit No. 3 and Sun Jinglin of the Repair Team No. 3 in the Tunneling Area, to summarize their experiences in organizing workers and leading meticulous work, and then asked them to share their experiences and introduce them to other grassroots cadres at the lecture meeting. In addition, it also organized several symposiums with the joint participation of new and old deputy squad leaders and outstanding deputy squad leaders, widely exchanging grassroots work experience through everyone summarizing and everyone introducing.

Through this method, Fushun Longfeng Mine quickly improved the leadership ability of the deputy squad leaders, effectively promoting production. For example, Zhang Junfu, who was newly promoted from worker to deputy squad leader, still worked with the workers like he did when he was a worker in the past, and if the task was not completed, he would not leave the well for one or two days. After listening to the experiences introduced by Chen Yong and others this time, he realized that to be a good deputy squad leader, one cannot rely solely on oneself; it is more important to mobilize the enthusiasm of all the workers in the squad. After that, he followed the learned experience, first understanding the equipment, materials, and workface conditions before going to work every day, deploying tasks, arranging manpower, and explaining measures at the pre-shift meeting according to the specific production situation of the day, and then focusing on the most vulnerable key links to help the workers break through them one by one. This not only made the leadership work well-organized, but also gave full play to the enthusiasm of each worker. In the past, Shao Jinsheng, the deputy squad leader of the Fifth District, had a relatively simple leadership method, only knowing how to assign tasks to the workers and asking them how many carts of coal to produce. After hearing the experience of excellent deputy squad leader Sun Jinglin introducing how to grasp the thoughts of each worker and help backward workers work hard to learn from the advanced, thereby promoting the continuous improvement of the entire squad's production during the study, he realized that to be a good deputy squad leader, one must not only manage production but also do a good job in ideological and political work. He applied the leadership experience of Sun Jinglin and others in practice. In addition to grasping production, he also kept abreast of the ideological trends of all the workers in the squad. If he found that any worker's thinking was fluctuating, he immediately helped solve the problem through individual conversations and other methods, and frequently reported to the Party organization to obtain the Party organization's instructions and assistance. After that, all the workers in the squad maintained full labor enthusiasm as always and excellently completed the production tasks. More than 130 deputy squad leader-level grassroots leading cadres throughout the mine, like Zhang Junfu and Shao Jinsheng, after exchanging experience and learning from each other, quickly overcame the different degrees of weaknesses in their previous leadership work, such as individual hard work, lack of knowledge, chaotic work, and failure to grasp the key points, and universally improved their leadership level, providing favorable conditions for the continuous rise in coal production throughout the mine.

    利用班前班后时间　总结工作广泛交流经验
    龙凤矿举办基层工作讲习会
    全矿一百三十多名副班长领导能力普遍提高
    据新华社抚顺23日电　抚顺龙凤煤矿举办基层工作经验讲习会，通过基层干部“人人总结、人人介绍、人人学习”的办法，有效地提高了基层干部的工作能力和领导水平。
    龙凤矿昼夜随班指挥生产的基层干部——副班长，90％以上都是陆续从工人中新提拔起来的。这些副班长富有实际生产经验，干劲十足，但一般都缺乏组织领导生产的经验。这个矿的党委举办的基层工作经验讲习会，就是为了迅速提高这些干部的领导水平而采取的措施。在讲习会上，除由党委、行政负责干部讲解国内外形势和当前任务、以及副班长工作职责外，特别着重组织基层干部总结自己的工作经验，以自己亲身经验的实际事例，通过报告、座谈、讨论等形式，互相交流。这个矿首先从直接生产单位入手，组织了采区和井巷煤掘进等九个部门的一百三十六名副班长，利用班前、班后业余时间进行了学习。在开会前，矿领导人帮助过去一贯生产好、安全好的搭连坑三井陈勇、井巷区维修三班孙景林等几个优秀的副班长，一一总结了他们的善于组织工人、领导工作细致等经验，然后请他们现身说法，在讲习会上，向其他基层干部做了介绍。并且还多次组织有新、老副班长和优秀副班长共同参加的座谈会，通过人人总结、人人介绍，广泛地交流了基层工作经验。
    抚顺龙凤矿通过这种办法，使副班长很快地提高了领导工作的能力，有效地推动了生产。例如，新由工人提升为副班长的张俊福，在开始做基层工作时，还像过去当工人时一样，和工人一起干，任务完不成，就一天、两天不离开井下。这次在听了陈勇等人介绍的经验后，认识到要做好副班长，不能光靠自己一个人，更重要的是把全班工人的积极性调动起来。此后他就按照学来的经验，每天上班前，先把设备、材料和掌子情况了解清楚，在班前会上，根据当天生产具体情况，部署任务，安排力量，交清措施，然后自己抓住重点，到最薄弱的关键环节上去，帮助工人一一突破，这样既使领导工作做得有条不紊，每个工人的干劲也都得到了充分发挥。过去五区副班长邵金生领导方法比较简单，只知向工人布置任务，要求工人出多少车煤。在学习中听到优秀副班长孙景林介绍怎样掌握每个工人思想，帮助后进工人发愤学习先进，从而促进全班生产不断提高的经验后，使他认识到当好副班长，不仅要管生产，还必须做好思想政治工作。他在实践中运用了孙景林等的领导经验，除抓生产外还把全班工人的思想动向掌握在心里，发现哪个工人思想有波动，立即通过个别谈心等办法，帮助解决，并且经常向党组织汇报，取得党组织的指示和帮助，这以后，全班工人个个始终如一地保持着饱满的劳动热情，出色地完成生产任务。全矿一百三十多名副班长级基层领导干部就像张俊福、邵金生一样，经过相互交流经验学习后，迅速克服了已往个人实干、心中无数、工作忙乱、抓不住重点等轻重不同的领导工作上的弱关，普遍提高了领导水平，为全矿煤炭生产的持续上升提供了有利的条件。
