    Ample Livestock, Meticulous Cultivation, Continuous Increase in Production
    Tongxin Production Team Improves Feeding and Herding Methods, Doubles the Number of Draft Cattle in Two Years
    (Our Shanghai, December 29th dispatch) Since communization, the Tongxin Production Team of Huanglu Commune in Nanhui County, Shanghai, has thoroughly and meticulously implemented the Party's relevant policies in all aspects of draft cattle feeding, use, and breeding. It has fully mobilized the enthusiasm of production teams and breeders, so that the team's draft cattle are not only well-fed and well-used, giving full play to their potential and powerfully promoting the development of agricultural production, but also breeding rapidly, becoming a red flag in cattle raising in the suburban countryside. At present, this team is carefully tending to its draft cattle, ensuring pregnancy and fattening, to welcome the great spring production.
    Under the unified leadership of the commune, this production team first earnestly adhered to the small-scale ownership of the small teams. In the winter of 1958, when the commune was first established, the right to use draft cattle was handed over to the small teams, and the feeding and breeding were also the responsibility of the small teams. On this basis, the Party branch of the production team insisted on implementing the Party's principle of combining political command with material guarantees. On the one hand, it continuously strengthened the political and ideological education of cadres and commune members, so that they fully recognized the great significance of raising draft cattle well for developing agricultural production and carefully managing them. On the other hand, it meticulously formulated and implemented a rational system of distribution according to labor, more work, more gain, thus forming a style of everyone cherishing cattle and caring for cattle. In the past two years, every head of draft cattle in this team has been fat and strong, with the average fat score maintained above 70% year-round. No cattle have ever died. The strong, weak, old, and young draft cattle have all been used rationally, and the farming efficiency has increased by more than 20% compared with the period of the advanced cooperative. At the same time, the total number of draft cattle in the team rapidly increased from 82 at the beginning of communization to 238. It not only met the needs of the team but also sold 120 head, powerfully supporting the neighboring communes and production teams that lacked cattle. This year, all 72 of the team's eligible cows continued to be fully bred, and 24 have already given birth to calves.
    The Tongxin Production Team is located in the far suburbs of Shanghai, and the land mainly relies on cattle power for plowing and irrigation. In the period of the advanced cooperative, due to lack of experience, the team's draft cattle were uniformly dispatched by the cooperative and temporarily distributed to the small teams for use. The small teams often competed for strong cattle and overused them. Since the small teams were not responsible for draft cattle breeding, they also relaxed the supervision and inspection of the breeders in this regard, resulting in a low breeding rate of draft cattle at that time, and insufficient cattle power affected farming. After the establishment of the commune, production developed more rapidly, and farming required more refinement. The original feeding, use, and breeding of draft cattle in this team seemed even more incompatible with this situation. On the basis of summing up past cattle raising experience, the Party branch of the production team, after full consultation with the small team cadres, rationally allocated draft cattle according to the size of the cultivated land of each small team, matching them according to their physical strength, age, and size, and fixed them for the small teams to use, with breeding also being the responsibility of the small teams, in order to mobilize the enthusiasm of the small teams. At the same time, the branch appointed the deputy secretary to be specifically responsible for leading the cattle raising work, and established a draft cattle management committee composed of the deputy secretary, the captains of each small team, two old farmers, and four breeders to lead the team's cattle raising work, thus ensuring that the draft cattle were both distributed to the small teams for fixed use and had centralized unified leadership.
    In leading the cattle raising work, the Party branch of the production team first grasped the political and ideological work, constantly improving the cadres' and commune members' understanding of the importance of raising draft cattle well. The branch has always insisted on checking draft cattle while checking production, and regards raising draft cattle well as an important content for measuring the quality of the work of the production team and production team cadres. At the same time, grasping certain incorrect ideological tendencies that appear among the cadres, they are corrected in a timely manner by discussing the actual situation and expounding the principles. In terms of ideological education for breeders, the branch appointed the draft cattle management committee to hold "study sessions," once every half month during normal times and once a month during busy farming seasons. The three members of the branch took turns giving political lessons, talking about the situation, explaining the overall picture, and also talking about the importance of raising draft cattle well for promoting production, enhancing their sense of responsibility for raising draft cattle well. In the past two years, this team has also created a lively and vivid form of political work that combines the education of cadres, breeders, and general commune members, that is, through small monthly appraisals of draft cattle, large quarterly appraisals, and two concentrated large "cattle comparisons" before spring plowing and autumn planting, organizing "learning, comparing, catching up, and helping" competitions between small teams and between breeders.
    At the same time, the Tongxin Production Team reasonably stipulated the labor remuneration and rewards for breeders and farmers in accordance with the Party's principles of distribution according to labor and more work, more gain in all aspects of draft cattle feeding, use, and breeding. In addition to giving rewards to breeders for breeding calves, the small team is also rewarded.
    In order to ensure that draft cattle are well-raised, well-used, and bred quickly, this team has also stipulated various meticulous responsibility systems, including: a planned grass-use system, a draft cattle handover system between breeders and farmers, and a planned breeding system.
    With the Tongxin Production Team raising draft cattle well, using them well, and breeding them quickly, the entire team not only relies on draft cattle for all heavy labor such as plowing, harrowing, and irrigation, but also uses animal-powered machinery for rice and wheat harvesting and threshing. Even the construction of canals uses cattle to pull stone rollers and transport earth, so that this production team, which originally lacked labor, can not only engage in intensive farming, continuously increase the multiple cropping index, and open up wasteland along the river to expand the cultivated area, but also complete each season's production tasks faster and with higher quality than any other production team in the commune. In the past two years, the newly added cultivated area of this team accounted for 11% of the original cultivated area, and the grain yield per unit area has increased year by year. It has changed from a grain-deficient team in the period of the advanced cooperative to a team with surplus grain every year. Commune members proudly call it the "commune's granary."

    畜力充裕  耕作细致  连年增产
    同心生产队改善饲养和使役方法，两年来耕牛繁殖一倍多
    本报上海29日电　上海市南汇县黄路公社同心生产队公社化以来，在耕牛喂养、使用、繁殖各个环节上，一直深入、细致地贯彻执行党的各项有关政策，充分调动了生产小队和饲养员的积极性，使全队耕牛不仅养得壮、用得好，发挥了潜力，有力地促进了农业生产的发展，而且繁殖迅速，成为市郊农村养牛的一面红旗。目前，这个队正在精心养护耕牛，保胎保膘，迎接明春大生产。
    这个生产队在公社的统一领导下，首先认真坚持了小队的小部分所有制。1958年冬季公社刚成立，就把耕牛使用权交给小队，喂养、繁殖也由小队负责。在这基础上，生产队党支部坚持执行党的政治挂帅和物质保证相结合的原则，一面不断加强对干部和社员的政治思想教育，使他们充分认识养好耕牛对发展农业生产的重大意义，仔细经管，一面周密制定和实行了合理的按劳分配制度，多劳多得，从而形成人人爱护牛、关心牛的风尚。这个队在两年多内，头头耕牛膘足力大，平均膘分常年保持在七成以上，从来没有死过一头牛；耕牛强弱老小都得到合理使用，耕作效率较高级社时期提高20％以上。同时，全队耕牛迅速由公社化初期的八十二头繁殖到二百三十八头，不仅满足了本队的需要，还出售了一百二十头，有力地支援了邻近缺牛的公社和生产队。今年全队适龄的七十二头母牛继续头头全配满怀，有二十四头已产下小牛。
    同心生产队地处上海远郊，土地主要依靠牛力翻耕和车水灌溉。高级社时期由于缺乏经验，这个队耕牛都由社里统一调度，临时分配给小队使用，小队间往往出现互争强牛和使役过度现象；小队由于对耕牛繁殖没有责任，在这方面也放松了对饲养员的检查督促，以致当时耕牛繁殖率不高，并因牛力不足，影响耕作。公社成立后，生产发展更加迅速，耕作要求更加精细，这个队原来的耕牛喂养、使用、繁殖情况和这一形势显得更加不相适应。生产队党支部在总结过去养牛经验的基础上，经过和小队干部充分协商，根据各小队耕地面积的大小，将耕牛按体力强弱，年龄老小合理搭配，固定给小队使用，繁殖也由小队负责，以调动小队的积极性。与此同时，支部指定副书记专责领导养牛工作，并成立由副支书、各小队队长、两个老农和四个饲养员组成耕牛管理委员会，领导全队的养牛工作，这样就保证了耕牛既分散给小队固定使用，又有集中的统一领导。
    这个生产队党支部在领导养牛工作中，首先抓紧政治思想工作，不断提高干部和社员对养好耕牛重要意义的认识。支部一直坚持检查生产同时检查耕牛，把养好耕牛作为衡量生产队和生产小队干部工作好坏的一个重要内容。同时抓住干部中出现某些不正确的思想倾向，就实论虚，及时加以纠正。在对饲养员的思想教育方面，支部指定耕牛管理委员会举办“学习会”，平时半月一次，农忙一月一次，由支部的三个委员轮流上政治课，谈形势、讲大局，又讲养好耕牛对促进生产的重要性，增强他们养好耕牛的责任感。两年多来，这个队还创造了一种把对干部、饲养员和一般社员教育结合起来的、生动活泼的政治工作形式，这就是通过耕牛一月一小评、一季一大评、一年春耕秋种前两次集中大“比牛”，组织小队与小队、饲养员与饲养员间，开展“学、比、赶、帮”竞赛活动。
    与此同时，同心生产队在耕牛喂养、使用和繁殖各方面都根据党的按劳分配和多劳多得的原则，合理规定饲养员和耕田手的劳动报酬和奖励。其中繁殖小牛除了给饲养员以奖励外，还规定奖励小队。
    这个队为了保证耕牛养好、用好、繁殖快，还规定了各种周密的责任制度，其中有：计划用草制度、饲养员和耕田手间的耕牛交接制、计划繁殖制等。
    同心生产队耕牛养得好、用得好、繁殖快，全队不仅耕耙、灌溉等繁重劳动全部由耕牛负担，稻麦收割、脱粒使用了畜力机具，甚至兴修水渠也用牛拉石?和运土，使这个原来劳动力不足的生产队，不仅能够从事精耕细作、不断增加复种指数和开辟河边荒地扩大耕地面积，而且每季生产任务完成之快、质量之高都在公社各生产队的最前列。这个队两年多时间内新增耕地面积占原耕地面积的11％，粮食单位面积产量逐年增加，由高级社时期的缺粮队，一变为年年余粮，社员骄傲地称它为“公社的粮仓”。
