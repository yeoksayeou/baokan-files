    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 11th December: According to a broadcast by the Lao Fighting Units Radio tonight, Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, issued a call urging the Lao people to unite and jointly defend the capital Vientiane, defend the legitimate government, and defend the path of peace, neutrality, and national harmony.

    The call stated that after the failure of the riots launched by the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak traitorous clique on December 8th, and after Captain Kong Le, together with the army and the people, occupied the capital Vientiane and defended Prince Souvanna Phouma's legitimate government, U.S. imperialism and the Thai reactionaries are stepping up arrangements for the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique to launch a large-scale offensive against Vientiane. Their malicious aim is to attempt to occupy Vientiane, the administrative center of the country, overthrow Prince Souvanna Phouma's legitimate government, and establish a puppet government, in order to undermine the policies of peace, neutrality, and national harmony, continue to expand the civil war, return Laos to its previous dark state, and transform Laos into a military colony and war base for U.S. imperialism. Currently, their cunning scheme is to use deceptive methods, with false slogans of peace, neutrality, and national harmony, to paralyze the vigilance of the troops and people in Vientiane, so that they can take advantage of the people's relaxation of vigilance to quickly surround and attack Vientiane.

    The call stated that our country is facing a serious threat, and the current situation is more critical than ever. The urgent task of the Lao people is to fight resolutely to save the nation's destiny. Everyone must rise up to jointly defend Vientiane, the central capital of the Kingdom of Laos, defend the legitimate government, and defend the path of peace, neutrality, and national harmony. The call pointed out that the dangerous enemies of the Lao nation, and the chief culprits who have brought us the above disasters, are U.S. imperialism and its lackey, the Thai reactionaries, and the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique, which is determined to sell out the country and the people to U.S. imperialism.

    The call urged all Lao people, as well as officers and soldiers of the Kingdom's army, to unite and fight resolutely to defend Prince Souvanna Phouma's legitimate government's policies of peace, neutrality, and national harmony, and to resolutely oppose all divisive and deceptive schemes of the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique.

    The call especially urged the troops and people of Vientiane to carry forward the tradition of unity and struggle, make the ranks more consolidated and stronger, and jointly and bravely resist the enemy's offensive, and absolutely not allow them to occupy the capital.

    The call expressed confidence that the cadres and fighters of the Lao Fighting Units and the people's armed forces will fight shoulder to shoulder with the national army, fight heroically, and complete the task of resolutely defending the capital Vientiane and defeating the traitorous clique. The call said that although our struggle will still encounter difficulties and obstacles, and although we will have to endure prolonged hardship, we must at all times safeguard the supreme rights of the survival of the nation and the people, and defend the country, religion, the King, and the Constitution.

    The call concluded by saying that we have the unity of the whole people, and our just struggle of the Lao people is warmly supported by peace-loving people all over the world. Victory will surely belong to us.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 12th December: According to a broadcast by the Lao Fighting Units Radio today: More than 2,000 people from all walks of life in Sam Neua City held a rally and parade on the afternoon of December 9th, warmly welcoming and supporting the Second Parachute Battalion and the coup committee headed by Captain Kong Le, as well as the youth, civil servants, army, police and other people of Vientiane, in their resolute struggle and their heroic spirit in crushing the riots created by the rebels in Vientiane.

    People from all walks of life also firmly expressed their opposition to the interference and aggression of U.S. imperialism and the Thai reactionaries in Laos, and firmly opposed the conspiracy of the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique, which is concentrating its forces and preparing to attack Vientiane, in an attempt to overthrow the legitimate government of Phouma, destroy the path of peace and neutrality, and turn Laos into a colony and military base of U.S. imperialism.

    The rally demanded that the government take a firm stance against the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique, and called on the coup committee, the Second Parachute Battalion, and the youth, students, civil servants, and other people of Vientiane to unite and fight resolutely to eliminate the traitorous clique, defend the legitimate government of Phouma, and defend the capital of Laos.

    新华社河内11日电　据寮国战斗部队电台今晚广播，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王发表号召书，号召老挝人民团结起来，共同保卫首都万象，保卫合法政府，保卫和平中立和民族和睦路线。
    号召书说，在富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞叛国集团12月8日发动的暴乱失败、贡勒大尉同军队和人民一起占领了首都万象并保卫了梭发那·富马亲王的合法政府以后，美帝国主义和泰国反动派正加紧布置富米—文翁叛国集团对万象进行大规模的进攻。他们的恶毒目的是企图占领国家的行政中心万象，推翻梭发那·富马亲王的合法政府，建立傀儡政府，以便破坏和平中立和民族和睦政策，继续扩大内战，使老挝重新陷入以前的黑暗状态，把老挝变为美帝国主义的军事殖民地和战争基地。目前，他们的狡猾阴谋是，利用以虚假的和平中立和民族和睦为口号的欺骗方法，来麻痹万象部队和人民的警惕性，以便利用人们放松警惕的时候，迅速包围和进攻万象。
    号召书说，我国正在遭到严重的威胁，目前形势比任何时候都严重。当前老挝人民的迫切任务是坚决斗争，拯救民族的命运。大家起来共同保卫老挝王国的中心首都万象，保卫合法政府，保卫和平中立和民族和睦路线。号召书指出，老挝民族的危险敌人、给我们带来上述灾难的主犯是美帝国主义及其走狗泰国反动派，是决心把国家和人民出卖给美帝国主义的富米—文翁叛国集团。
    号召书号召所有老挝人民，以及王国军队的官兵们团结起来，坚决为保卫梭发那·富马亲王的合法政府的和平中立和民族和睦政策而斗争，坚决反对富米—文翁叛国集团的一切分裂和欺骗阴谋。
    号召书特别号召万象的部队和人民发扬团结斗争的传统，使队伍更加巩固和坚强，共同起来英勇地反对敌人的进攻，绝对不能让他们占领首都。
    号召书表示确信，寮国战斗部队的干部、战士和人民武装力量，将同全国军队并肩一起，英勇战斗，完成坚决保卫首都万象、战胜叛国集团的任务。号召书说，我们的斗争尽管还会遇到困难和阻碍，尽管还要承受长时间的艰苦，但是我们在任何时候都一定要维护民族和人民的生死存亡的最高权利，保卫国家、宗教、国王和宪法。
    号召书最后说，我们有全民的团结，我们老挝人民的正义斗争得到全世界爱好和平人民的热烈支持，胜利一定属于我们。
    新华社河内12日电　据寮国战斗部队电台今天广播：老挝桑怒市各阶层人民二千多人12月9日下午举行集会和游行，热烈欢迎和支持第二伞兵营和以贡勒大尉为首的政变委员会以及万象青年、公务员、军队、警察和其他阶层人民坚决斗争，粉碎叛乱分子在万象制造的暴乱的英勇精神。
    各阶层人民还坚决表示反对美帝国主义和泰国反动集团对老挝的干涉和侵略，坚决反对富米·诺萨万叛国集团正在集中兵力，准备进攻万象，企图推翻富马合法政府，破坏和平中立路线把老挝变成美帝国主义的殖民地和军事基地的阴谋。
    集会要求政府对富米·诺萨万叛国集团采取坚决态度，并呼吁政变委员会、第二伞兵营同万象青年、学生、公务员和其他阶层人民团结一致，坚决斗争，以消灭叛国集团，保卫富马合法政府和保卫老挝首都。
