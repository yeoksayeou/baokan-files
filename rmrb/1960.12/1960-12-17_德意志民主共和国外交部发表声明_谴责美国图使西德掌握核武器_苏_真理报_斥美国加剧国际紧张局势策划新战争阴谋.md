Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 14th: The Foreign Ministry of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement on the evening of December 14th regarding the upcoming meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Council, condemning the U.S. aggressive bloc for attempting to allow former Hitlerite generals in West Germany to control atomic weapons, aggravating the international situation, and threatening peace.

The statement pointed out that the Supreme Commander of the European Forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, U.S. General Norstad, requested that the upcoming meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council endorse the establishment of a NATO "mobile task force" equipped with atomic weapons. Norstad has formally requested the West German government to participate in the establishment of this force. In this way, the United States has met the demand of Bonn's Minister of War Strauss to arm the West German Federal Defense Forces with atomic weapons without restriction.

The statement pointed out that the Bonn government is systematically implementing the "Memorandum" of the Federal Defense Forces General Staff in August of this year on accelerating the armament of the West German army with atomic weapons. The statement said that Hitler's generals demanded that the West German Federal Defense Forces be armed without restriction with the most modern rockets and nuclear weapons. Bonn's militarists demanded that the West German Federal Defense Forces participate in the "mobile task force" with atomic equipment and participate in the work of expanding the North Atlantic Group into a "fourth atomic power."

The statement said that handing over atomic weapons to Hitler's generals means a serious aggravation of the international situation, especially the situation in Germany. This will make all disarmament efforts more difficult, pose a serious threat to peace, and threaten the people of European countries with atomic war.

The statement said: "European security urgently requires: Do not hand over atomic weapons to Hitler's generals! All peace-loving people and countries must rise up against the West German militarists who, regardless of the wishes of the West German residents and the interests of the people of European countries, are trying to launch an atomic war. Whoever helps to satisfy the demands of Hitler's generals must bear full responsibility for the consequences that will inevitably arise from this."

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow: The Soviet newspaper *Pravda* said in a commentary on December 13th entitled "New Conspiracy Against the Cause of Peace" that the dangerous plan of U.S. imperialism to arm NATO troops with nuclear weapons is a conspiracy that the Pentagon has been planning for a long time. Norstad, Commander-in-Chief of the NATO Armed Forces in Europe, has more than once publicly advocated the implementation of this plan. The proposal of this dangerous plan shows that U.S. imperialism is afraid of the growth of the strength and prestige of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp, and is afraid of the upsurge of the struggle of the broad masses of the people for democracy, national liberation, and socialism.

The commentary pointed out that the U.S. reactionary group, in realizing its plan, first wants to rely on Bonn. This plan will lead to the establishment of a direct military alliance between Washington and Bonn. Its purpose is to aggravate international tensions, step up the nuclear arms race, and implement an adventurous plan to prepare for a new war in the center of Europe, turning Western Europe into an outpost of the North Atlantic Group.

    谴责美国图使西德掌握核武器
    苏“真理报”斥美国加剧国际紧张局势策划新战争阴谋
    据新华社柏林14日电　德意志民主共和国外交部14日晚间就即将召开的北大西洋公约集团理事会会议发表声明，谴责美国侵略集团力图让西德的前希特勒将领掌握原子武器，加剧国际局势，威胁和平。
    声明指出，北大西洋公约组织欧洲部队最高司令、美国将军诺斯塔德，要求即将召开的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议赞同建立一支用原子武器装备起来的北大西洋集团“机动作战部队”。诺斯塔德已经正式请求西德政府参加建立这支部队。这样，美国就满足了波恩战争部长施特劳斯用原子武器无限制地武装西德联邦国防军的要求。
    声明指出，波恩政府正在有系统地实现今年8月联邦国防军参谋部关于加速用原子武器武装西德军队的“备忘录”。声明说，希特勒将军们要求用最现代化的火箭和核武器无限制地武装西德联邦国防军。波恩的军国主义者要求西德联邦国防军参加有原子装备的“机动作战部队”，和参加把北大西洋集团扩建为“第四原子国”的工作。
    声明说，把原子武器交到希特勒将军们的手中，意味着国际局势、特别是德国的局势的严重加剧。这将使一切裁军努力变得更加困难，使和平遭到严重威胁，使欧洲各国人民遭到原子战争的威胁。
    声明说：“欧洲安全迫切要求：不要把原子武器交到希特勒将军的手中！一切爱好和平的人民和国家都必须起来反对不顾西德居民的愿望和欧洲各国人民的利益而力图发动原子战争的西德军国主义者。谁帮助满足希特勒将军的要求，谁就必须对由此而不可避免地产生的后果承担全部责任。”
    新华社莫斯科电　苏联《真理报》13日在一篇题为《反对和平事业的新阴谋》的评论中说，美帝国主义用核武器武装北大西洋集团军队的危险计划是五角大楼策划已久的阴谋。北大西洋集团驻欧武装部队总司令诺斯塔德曾不止一次地公开主张实现这一计划。这一危险计划的提出，说明了美帝国主义害怕苏联和社会主义阵营力量和威信的增长，害怕广大人民群众争取民主、民族解放和社会主义的斗争的高涨。
    评论指出，美国反动集团在实现自己的计划时，首先是想依靠波恩。这个计划将导致华盛顿—波恩的直接的军事同盟的成立。其目的是加剧国际紧张局势，加紧进行核武装竞赛，并在欧洲中心执行准备新战争的冒险计划，把西欧变成北大西洋集团的前哨阵地。
