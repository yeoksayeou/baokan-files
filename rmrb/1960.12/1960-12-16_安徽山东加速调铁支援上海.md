Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, December 15th: Anhui Province's steel production surged in early December. The average daily steel production increased by 29.5% compared to late November, and iron production increased by 17.4%. The increase in external transfer of pig iron was even greater, rising by 25% in early December compared to late November. Various regions are determined to complete the pig iron transfer plan to Shanghai ahead of schedule, ensuring that every ton of pig iron transferred to Shanghai is smelted into steel this year, fulfilling the glorious obligation to complete the state's annual steel production plan.

Since the beginning of December, many steel plant workers have further launched competitions, striving to complete the state plan ahead of schedule. After the Anqing Steel Plant launched mutual assistance and cooperation competitions among its blast furnaces, the daily pig iron production in the first five days of December increased by 18.21% compared to the last five days of November, and the state's annual pig iron plan was completed twenty days ahead of schedule. Many steel plants in Hefei, Ma'anshan, Wuhu, and other places have completed the state's annual pig iron plan and are currently striving to produce more pig iron. The crushing workers in the provincial party committee's steel plant strengthened the maintenance of the crushers, increasing the ore crushing efficiency of each machine per shift to 70 tons. Transportation workers at the Zhengfa No. 1 Iron Plant increased daily transportation volume by 70% after changing the labor organization. These plants not only ensured that the blast furnaces were "fed well and fed fully" but also guaranteed that the blast furnaces had several days of reserves, ensuring a continuous increase in pig iron production. Wuhu City's steel plants further launched a movement for high blast temperature, high load, high coefficient, and low consumption. The various indicators of the Wencjiao Iron Plant's No. 1 blast furnace have exceeded those of the city's original most advanced Jiangdong No. 1 furnace. Twenty-nine blast furnaces in nearby steel plants adopted the advanced ash removal method of the Wencjiao Iron Plant's No. 1 blast furnace and the improved multi-nozzle combustion experience, generally increasing daily output by 8%. Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company adopted nine major measures, including further launching labor competitions and focusing on the production and transfer of raw materials, increasing the daily steel production in early December by 28.2% and iron production by 11.9% compared to late November.

While striving to produce more steel, Anhui Province is also transferring most of the pig iron produced daily to Shanghai for steelmaking as quickly as possible. Fuyang Prefecture and Tongling City, which have larger ironmaking scales, are transferring all of the pig iron they have recently produced to Shanghai for steelmaking, without using a single ton for themselves.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, December 15th: Shandong is transferring more and better-quality pig iron to Shanghai to support key enterprises in increasing the production of high-quality steel.

In early November, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee issued instructions requiring responsible cadres from various localities, municipal party committees, and key iron-producing area party committees to personally take charge and strengthen the transfer of pig iron while focusing on current pig iron production, ensuring the on-time, high-quality, and full-quantity completion of the external transfer task of pig iron. The Provincial Party Committee also established seven iron transfer teams to provide specific assistance to seven key iron-producing areas, including Jinan, Changwei, Yantai, and Linyi, which significantly increased the external transfer quantity of pig iron. In order to quickly transfer the large amount of pig iron produced, various localities strengthened short-distance transportation and loading and unloading forces. Jinan City fixed more than 30 trucks, more than 200 horse-drawn carts, and a large number of rickshaws to transport iron. In less than ten days, all 7,500 tons of pig iron accumulated in Laiwu were transported to the railway station for transfer to Shanghai.

The railway department has also listed pig iron transfer as one of the current key materials. Stations and sections with pig iron transportation tasks are finding out about the source of goods in advance, sending vehicles wherever there is iron, and giving priority to transportation.

The employees of various ironmaking units have tried every possible means to increase the production and quality of pig iron. The average daily pig iron production in the province in early December increased by more than 14% compared to late November, and the quality of pig iron has generally improved.

    安徽山东加速调铁支援上海
    据新华社合肥15日电  安徽省12月上旬钢铁产量猛增，钢的平均日产量比11月下旬增长29.5％，铁增长17.4％；外调生铁量增长更多，12月上旬比11月下旬增长了25％。各地决心提前完成对上海的调铁计划，使调往上海的生铁吨吨都能在今年内炼成钢，为完成国家全年钢铁产量计划尽到光荣的义务。
    进入12月以后，很多钢铁厂的职工，都进一步展开竞赛，力争提前完成国家计划。安庆钢铁厂各个高炉展开互助协作赛后，12月前五天生铁日产量比11月后五天提高18.21％，并提前二十天完成了国家全年生铁计划。合肥、马鞍山、芜湖等地许多钢铁厂已经完成全年国家生铁计划，目前正在争取增产更多的生铁。省委机关钢铁厂破碎工人加强破碎机的保养工作，使每台每班矿石破碎工效提高到七十吨。政法一铁厂运输工人改变劳动组合后日运量提高了70％。这些厂不仅做到让高炉“吃饱、吃好”，而且保证高炉有几天的储备，保证了生铁产量不断上升。芜湖市各个钢铁厂进一步展开高风温、高负荷、高系数、低消耗运动。文教铁厂一号高炉的各项指标，都已超过全市原来最先进的江东一号炉。附近钢铁厂的二十九座高炉采用文教铁厂一号高炉的先进清灰办法和改革多嘴燃烧的经验，日产量一般都提高了8％。马鞍山钢铁公司采取了进一步开展劳动竞赛，狠抓原料的生产和调运等九大措施，使12月上旬钢的日产量比11月下旬增加28.2％，铁增加11.9％。
    安徽省各地一方面力争多产钢铁，一方面又尽快地把每天生产的大部分生铁调给上海炼钢。炼铁规模较大的阜阳专区和铜陵市，最近生产出的生铁一吨都不用，全部调往上海炼钢。
    新华社济南15日电　山东各地把数量更多、质量更好的生铁调往上海，支援重点企业增产好钢。
    中共山东省委，在11月初发出指示，要求各地、市委和重点产铁地区党委负责干部，亲自动手，在狠抓当前生铁生产的同时，加强生铁调运工作，保证按时、按质、按量地完成生铁外调任务。省委还成立七个调铁小组，分别到济南、昌潍、烟台、临沂等七个重点产铁地区，进行具体帮助，从而使生铁外调数量显著增加。为了把生产出来的大量生铁迅速地调出，各地都加强了短途运输和装卸力量。济南市固定了三十多部汽车，二百多辆马车和大批的人力车运铁，不到十天时间，就把莱芜积存的七千五百多吨生铁，全部运往火车站，转运上海。
    铁路部门也把生铁调运列为当前的重点物资之一。有生铁运输任务的站、段，都事先了解货源，那里有铁就往那里送车，优先运输。
    各炼铁单位的职工，千方百计地提高了生铁的产量和质量。全省12月上旬生铁的平均日产量比11月下旬提高14％以上，生铁质量普遍有所提高。
