In Our Commune

    This Opinion is Correct
    Li Jingchun, the Party Branch Secretary of the Luozhuang Production Team in our commune, is adept at transforming the Party's policies into the conscious actions of the masses in leading production. At the beginning of each task, Li Jingchun and the branch committee members would divide the work, assigning tasks to the commune members and explaining the policies. For example, when implementing the Party's policy of "vigorously developing agriculture, vigorously developing grain production," Li Jingchun organized a propaganda team to go deep into the production teams, organizing commune members to discuss the key issues in vigorously developing grain production. During the discussions, the commune members presented facts, identified key points, and proposed that the production team should transfer young and strong laborers to strengthen the front line of agricultural production, due to insufficient manpower for field labor. Li Jingchun said: This opinion is correct; the Party is calling for more than 80% of the labor force to participate in field labor during the busy farming season. Li Jingchun then helped the production team transfer ten laborers from logistical departments such as the canteen, nursery, and feed yard, and adopted the method of exchanging weaker laborers for stronger laborers and half-laborers for full laborers to strengthen field production, increasing the labor force on the agricultural front line from the original 70% to over 85%. This ensured meticulous harvesting and threshing during the autumn harvest. For example, during the spring planting this year, Li Jingchun presented the production plan to the commune members for discussion. Old farmer Bai Zeng suggested changing the original plan to plant sweet potatoes on more than 30 mu of land in Huaizhuangdao to planting corn. He said: "This piece of land is low-lying and prone to waterlogging, and it is also alkaline. Planting sweet potatoes is afraid of waterlogging and is easily killed by alkali, so it is better to plant corn to ensure a good harvest." Li Jingchun thought: The Party is calling for planting according to the production plan and planting corn in alkaline and waterlogged land is reasonable, so he accepted this suggestion and changed to planting corn, and indeed achieved a bumper harvest.

    这个意见很对
    我们公社罗庄生产队党支部书记李景春，在领导生产中，长于把党的政策变成群众的自觉行动。每项工作开始的时候，李景春总是和支部委员分工向社员交任务、讲政策。如在贯彻执行党的“大办农业、大办粮食”方针的时候，李景春就组织了宣传小组，深入到各生产小队，组织社员讨论大办粮食的关键问题是什么？在讨论中，社员们摆事实，找关键，提出了参加田间劳动的人力不足，建议生产队抽调青壮劳动力加强农业生产第一线。李景春说：这个意见很对，党就是号召农忙时要有百分之八十以上的劳力参加田间劳动。李景春就帮助生产队从食堂、托儿所、饲养场等后勤部门，抽调了十个劳动力，并采取以弱劳力换强劳力，以半劳力换整劳力的办法加强了田间生产，使农业第一线的劳动力由原来的百分之七十增加到百分之八十五以上。在秋收时期做到了精收细打。又如，今年春播的时候，李景春把生产计划交给社员讨论，老农白增建议把原计划在槐庄道三十多亩地栽的甘薯改成种玉米。他说：“这块地地势洼容易涝，又有碱，栽甘薯怕涝，又容易被碱死，不如种玉米能保收成。”李景春想到：党号召按着生产计划因地种植，在碱洼地种玉米是合理的，就接受了这个建议，改种了玉米，果然获得了丰收。
