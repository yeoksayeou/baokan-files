    Regularly Convene Commune Member Congresses to Discuss Improvements in the Cafeteria Work
    Banyuashan Cafeteria's Democratic Management is Getting Better and Better
    Building a Foundation, Conserving Grain, Diverse Meals, and Satisfied Commune Members
    (Reported by our newspaper) The Banyuashan Team Cafeteria of the Hexi Production Team in the Yongyang Commune of Weng'an County, Guizhou Province, regularly convenes commune member congresses and commune member representative meetings to study commune members' living problems and inspect and improve cafeteria work, ensuring that the cafeteria is run by everyone and is getting better and better.
    More than two hundred people eat at the Banyuashan Cafeteria. Although there is only one accountant and two cooks, due to the conscientious implementation of democratic management and the insistence on regularly convening commune member congresses to listen to the opinions of the masses to improve cafeteria work, a solid cafeteria foundation has been established, achieving planned grain use, grain conservation, diverse meals, and satisfied commune members.
    The Banyuashan Team Cafeteria holds a commune member congress once a month. The powers of the commune member congress are, first, to democratically elect the cafeteria management committee, which is re-elected every six months. Another power of the commune member congress is to discuss major issues related to the cafeteria, form resolutions, and hand them over to the cafeteria management committee for implementation. The cafeteria management committee meets every five days to collectively discuss measures for implementing the resolutions of the commune member congress and then reports to all commune members at the next commune member congress.
    Elect Reliable "Heads of the Household"
    Through democratic elections by the commune member congress, those with good character, good style, good class background, fair dealings, and trusted by the majority of commune members are elected to the cafeteria management committee to be the "heads of the household." The current seven members are all poor and lower-middle peasants, including four Party members and one League member. The cafeteria management committee is trusted by the commune members and can also conscientiously work for all commune members. Among these seven members, the "four experts" are praised by the commune members. These are Yang Fuxing (Party member), the director of the management committee and team leader known as the "planning expert"; Shang Xiuzhang (League member), the "insurance accountant"; Shang Qinzhang, the "caring member" and deputy women's team leader; and Li Bizhong (Party member), the "leading captain" and cook.
    Yang Fuxing, the "planning expert," grasps the overall planning of production and life for the entire team. Under the premise of completing the production team's contracted production tasks, he tightly grasps the important link of developing cafeteria household production. The vegetables grown by the cafeteria, in addition to meeting daily needs, also have a surplus. Shang Xiuzhang, known as the "insurance accountant," manages the accounts, ensuring that the accounts match the funds, with receipts for disbursements and vouchers for receipts, and conscientiously accepts the supervision of the masses. Commune members say that the accounts she announces are "detailed and clear." Shang Qinzhang is the deputy women's team leader of the team. She is considerate to the female commune members. When someone's menstrual period arrives, she takes the initiative to notify them to take a break. If someone is pregnant and wants to eat something sour, she brings zao la zi (fermented chili) and pickled cucumbers from the cafeteria.
    Commune Members' Opinions are Fully Reflected
    Because of the insistence on convening commune member congresses to discuss cafeteria work, commune members' opinions are fully and widely reflected; the management committee collectively discusses and implements the resolutions of the commune member congress, so that many problems in life are resolved in a timely and good manner, and a series of systems have been established. In March of this year, the commune member congress discussed how to implement planned grain use to ensure that the cafeteria is well-run and grain is conserved. Dai Bingquan, the commune member in charge of milling rice, proposed changing from water-powered rice mills to stone roller rice mills. After this suggestion was implemented, the rice yield per hundred jin of paddy rice increased by about 5% compared to the original requirement. At this commune member congress, everyone also made a resolution on "diversifying meals" based on the opinions of the commune members. After this was implemented, the commune members not only ate diverse meals, but also had a surplus of grain. According to the principle that savings belong to the cafeteria, the cafeteria handed over the surplus grain to the commune members for their own disposal, and the commune members were very satisfied. After the cafeteria foundation developed, the commune member congress discussed and decided to adhere to running the cafeteria diligently and frugally, and to strictly control expenditures. Based on this, the cafeteria management committee stipulated the authority to approve expenditures. Larger expenditures must be approved by the management committee and the commune member congress respectively. Because expenditures are democratic and control is strict, this cafeteria has never wasted money.
    Accepting Commune Member Supervision and Correcting Shortcomings in a Timely Manner
    In addition to convening a commune member congress once a month to make decisions on cafeteria-related issues, the Banyuashan Cafeteria also convenes a commune member representative meeting every half month to reflect commune members' opinions in a timely and better manner and improve cafeteria work. The commune member representative meeting of this cafeteria is composed of eleven people. In addition to the members of the cafeteria management committee who are natural representatives, one representative is selected from each of the four work teams to participate. In addition, this cafeteria also frequently solicits opinions from commune members individually and encourages commune members to directly raise opinions, absorbing the correct opinions of commune members at any time and accepting the supervision of commune members. In the spring of this year, the cafeteria engaged in technological innovation. The management committee had a dispute over whether to spend about 100 yuan on equipment costs and brought it to the representative meeting for discussion. Commune member representative He Guangxian disagreed as soon as he heard that he would spend hundreds of yuan. He said: "Technological innovation requires doing it yourself." He Guangxian made a suggestion and, together with carpenter Wang Guomin, implemented the innovation plan and saved the equipment cost. Commune member representative Lü Dekai is a model for sanitation work and emphasizes that the cafeteria should pay attention to hygiene. All forty households in the team have thermos bottles, but the cafeteria did not pay much attention to boiling water at the beginning, and the commune members had opinions. Based on the opinions of the commune members, Lü Dekai proposed at the commune member representative meeting that the cafeteria should pay attention to the work of boiling water. After the representative meeting made a decision, every household's thermos bottle was filled with boiled water. Because the management personnel of the cafeteria have a democratic style, the commune members are very enthusiastic about participating in the management of the cafeteria, can point out the shortcomings in the cafeteria work in a timely manner, and put forward rationalization proposals.
    The result of the implementation of democratic management in the Banyuashan Cafeteria not only played a great role in improving the work of the cafeteria and improving the lives of the commune members, but also greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the commune members and promoted production.

    定期召开社员大会讨论改进食堂工作
    半月山食堂管理民主越办越好
    建立家底，用粮节约，饭菜多样，社员满意
    本报讯　贵州瓮安县雍阳公社河西生产队半月山小队食堂，定期召开社员大会、社员代表会议，研究社员生活问题，检查改进食堂工作，做到大家的食堂大家办，使食堂越办越好。
    半月山食堂有两百多人吃饭，虽然只有一个会计两个炊事员，但由于认真实行民主管理，坚持定期召开社员大会，听取广大群众意见改进食堂工作，建立了雄厚的食堂家底，做到了计划用粮、节约用粮，饭菜花样多，社员满意。
    半月山小队食堂一月召开一次社员大会。社员大会的职权，首先是民主选举食堂管理委员会，半年改选一次。社员大会的另一个职权是讨论有关食堂方面的重大问题，形成决议，交给食堂管理委员会负责贯彻执行。食堂管理委员会五天开一次会，按照社员大会的决议，集体讨论贯彻执行的措施，然后在下一次社员大会上向全体社员报告。
    选出可靠的“当家”人
    经过社员大会民主选举，那些品质好、作风好、成分好、办事公平、为大多数社员所信任的人被选到食堂管理委员会中去“当家”。现在的七个委员，都是贫农、下中农，其中党员四人、团员一人。食堂管理委员会受到社员群众的信赖，也能认真地为全体社员办事。这七个委员中，为社员津津乐道的有“四把手”。这就是号称“计划能手”的管理委员会主任、小队长杨福兴（党员），“保险会计”商秀章（团员），“贴心委员”、妇女副队长商琴章，“带头队长”、炊事员李碧中（党员）。
    “计划能手”杨福兴，掌握着全小队的生产生活大计，在完成生产队的包产任务的前提下，他紧紧地抓住了发展食堂家底生产这个重要环节。食堂种的蔬菜，除部分供日常生活必需外，还有节余。有“保险会计”称号的商秀章管的账，账款相符，出账有单据、入账有凭证，认真接受群众的监督。社员说她公布的账目是“报得出点点，指得出眼眼”。商琴章是小队的妇女副小队长，她对女社员体贴入微，谁的月经期到了，她就主动通知休假，谁怀孕了想吃点酸的，她就从食堂里端点糟辣子、泡黄瓜送去。
    社员意见得到充分反映
    由于坚持召开社员大会讨论食堂工作问题，社员的意见得到充分、广泛的反映；管理委员会集体讨论贯彻执行社员大会的决议，使生活上的许多问题得到及时的、很好的解决，并建立了一系列的制度。今年3月，社员大会讨论如何实行计划用粮，保证既把食堂办好，又节约粮食。负责碾米的社员戴丙全，提出改水碾碾米为?子碾米，这个建议实现以后，每百斤稻谷的出米率比原来要求的提高5％左右。在这次社员大会上，大家还根据社员意见作出了“饭菜多样化”的决议。照此实行以后，社员们不仅吃到了多样的饭菜，而用粮也有了节余。食堂根据节约归己的精神，把节余的粮食交给社员自行支配，社员们都很满意。食堂家底发展以后，社员大会讨论决定要坚持勤俭办食堂，对开支控制要严。食堂管理委员会据此规定了开支批准权限，对于较大的开支，分别由管理委员会和社员大会批准。由于开支民主、控制严格，这个食堂没有乱花过钱。
  接受社员监督及时改正缺点
    除了一月召开一次社员大会，对有关食堂问题作出决定外，半月山食堂还半月召开一次社员代表会议，以便及时地、更好地反映社员的意见，改进食堂工作。这个食堂的社员代表会议，由十一个人组成，除食堂管理委员会委员是当然代表外，另外由四个作业组各选一名代表参加。此外，这个食堂还经常向社员个别征求意见和发动社员直接提意见，随时随地吸收社员的正确意见，接受社员的监督。今年春季，食堂搞技术革新，管理委员会对是否开支一笔一百元左右的器材费有争论，就拿到代表会议上来讨论。社员代表何光先一听要花百把元钱，就不同意。他说：“技术革新要自己动手。”何光先提出建议，并和木匠王国民一起，实现了革新计划，省掉了这笔器材费。社员代表吕德开，是个卫生工作模范，很强调食堂讲卫生。全小队四十多户，家家都有开水瓶，但是食堂开始不大注意烧开水，社员有意见。吕德开根据社员的意见，在社员代表会议上提出食堂要重视烧开水的工作。代表会议作出决定后，社员家家开水瓶都灌上了开水。由于食堂管理人员作风民主，社员们参加食堂管理工作的积极性都很高，能够及时指出食堂工作中的缺点，并且提出合理化建议。
    半月山食堂实行民主管理的结果，不仅对提高食堂的工作、改善社员的生活起了很大作用，而且对社员的生产情绪鼓舞很大，促进了生产。
