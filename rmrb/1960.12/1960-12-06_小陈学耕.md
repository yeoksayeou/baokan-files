After the commune Party committee meeting adjourned, I headed home in the silvery moonlight. As I approached the village, I noticed someone bending over and tethering an ox by the paddy field. How strange! The village was quiet, everyone was asleep. Could someone be stealing an ox? I shouted, "Who's there?"

The person didn't answer but ran towards me. By the moonlight, I saw it was Xiao Chen. Xiao Chen is a high school graduate, a good young man. Although he grew up in the city, he has a pioneering spirit in the countryside. The day after he arrived in our team from the city, he wanted to learn to plow. I assigned him to weed the carrot patch, and he reluctantly agreed. By the fifth evening, he was "protesting" to me, waving his pale but sturdy arms and saying, "When will I stop weeding carrots? Even when eating, you change the flavor!" To be honest, I wanted him to practice behind the ox, but I knew from experience how stubborn the plow handle could be. For a young student, that thing would never be as obedient as a pen. So, I comforted him, saying, "Take it slowly. Even studying literature goes from simple to complex. Working also needs to progress from light to heavy." He nodded "uh-huh" at the time.

The Xiao Chen standing before me now seemed like a different person. Although the moonlight tried its best to paint his pale face, I could still see a red glow on it. His hair was messy, sweat on his forehead shone in the moonlight, and he was panting as if he had just been in a fight. I was startled and quickly asked him:

"Xiao Chen, what happened?"
"Alas, I shouldn't have ignored your advice."
"What? You secretly tried to learn to plow?"
"Yes," he lowered his head in admitting his mistake and murmured, "The big water buffalo looked down on me, bucked with the yoke, plowed a few crooked furrows in the field, and accidentally plowed old man Liu Er's vegetable plot from beginning to end, making it one plow-width wider…"
"Oh! You've caused trouble!" I thought. Old man Liu Er grew these vegetables after work. Peasants are like that; they especially cherish the fruits of their labor, even a grain or a blade of grass. Last autumn, his grandson crushed a few cabbages in his vegetable garden while catching crickets, and he scolded his grandson fiercely. To ease the young man's mind, I pretended to be unconcerned and said, "These vegetables are nothing. I'll go and talk to Liu Er. He's definitely not a petty person. Okay, forget about this and go back to sleep…"

To avoid disturbing old man Liu Er's sleep, I didn't knock on his door. I was afraid that Liu Er would start shouting and make Xiao Chen uncomfortable. The next day, I got up at the crack of dawn and hurried to Liu Er's house while buttoning my shirt. But his family said, "Someone called him out in the middle of the night; something must be up." I was taken aback. I walked west towards the field and saw someone plowing the field where the young man had messed up. Through the thin morning mist, I saw that the one holding the plow was Xiao Chen, and right behind him was Liu Er! I heard Liu Er constantly giving Xiao Chen pointers: "Right, higher, more slanted, squeeze the handle tighter!…"

Later, I learned that when I went to Liu Er's house that night, Xiao Chen had been secretly following me. When he saw that I hadn't done my job properly, he was still anxious and felt uneasy. After I left, he paced back and forth in front of Er's house, reaching out to knock on the door several times but pulling back. Until the middle of the night, seeing that dawn was not far away, he thought that the truth would come out sooner or later, and if he knew he was wrong, he should admit it. So, he plucked up his courage and knocked on the door. Liu Er listened to Xiao Chen's account and laughed heartily, "Oh, my good young man, these vegetables are nothing! Good, consider it tuition for agricultural college…" As he said this, he looked at Xiao Chen affectionately and nodded his head outward, "That's right, young people need to have this kind of drive and determination. Come on, I'll teach you how to plow!"

    小陈学耕
    葛玉莹
    在公社党委会开罢会，我踏着银亮的月光回家。快进村时，发现村边那块稻板田边上，有个人在弯着腰拴牛。多怪呀，村里静悄悄的，人们都睡了，难道有人偷牛吗？我大喝了一声：“谁？”
    那人没有回话，向我奔来了。我借着月光一看，啊，是小陈。小陈是个中学毕业生，是个好小伙子。别看他是在城里长大的，在农村倒有一股子闯劲。他从城里到我们队第二天就要学耕田，我安排他锄胡萝卜草，他噘着嘴答应了。到第五天晚上，便跟我“抗”起来，甩甩白白的倒还结实的胳膊说：“我锄胡萝卜草到啥时候？吃东西还换换口味呐！”说实话，我也想让他跟在牛后头锻炼锻炼，可我小时候领教过犁梢的那股硬脾气，对于青年学生来说，那家伙决不会像使笔杆那样听话。于是我劝慰他说：“慢慢来吧，攻书文还由浅入深哩，干活儿也得要由轻到重啊。”当时他“嗯嗯”地点点头。
    此刻站在我面前的小陈，似乎变成另一个人了。尽管这时月光尽量粉饰着他那白白的脸，但，我还是看清了他脸上正泛着红光。他头发乱蓬蓬的，额上汗水映着月光发亮，口里气喘吁吁，好像同什么人刚刚撕打过一般。我吓了一跳，忙问他道：
    “小陈，出了什么事啦？”
    “唉，不该把你的话当耳边风。”
    “怎么？你偷偷学耕田了？”
    “是呀，”他认错地低下头，喃喃地说：“大水牛瞧不起我，驾上轭头乱撞，田里歪歪斜斜犁了几条沟，倒把刘二老家的小菜地由头耕到尾翻了一犁宽……”
    “呀！你惹了祸啦！”我心里想。刘二老这点青菜是他收工回来种起来的。庄稼人都是这样，对自己劳动出来的果实，哪怕粒粮寸草都是特别珍惜的。去年秋天他孙子在他菜地里捉蟋蟀踏烂了几棵青菜，他吹胡子瞪眼睛地把孙子一顿好“熊”。为了宽宽小伙子的心，我假装若无其事地说：“这点菜算得什么，我替你去打招呼，刘二老决不是小气的人。好了，丢了这件心事回去好好睡觉吧。”……
    为了不妨碍刘二老的睡眠，我走到他家门口没有喊门，我怕刘二老起来乱吵嚷，弄得小陈也受不住。第二天鸡叫时我便起床了，边扭衣扣边往刘二老家奔。哪晓得他家里人说：“他大半夜光景被一个人喊出去有什么事了。”我不由得一怔，走到屋西朝田一望，啊，小伙子出事的田里有人耕田哩。透过薄薄的晨雾看去，那个掌犁的正是小陈，紧跟着小陈的是刘二老！我听到刘二老不时地还给小陈指点：“对，高些，斜些，手再捏得紧一点！……
    后来我才知道，当晚我去刘二老家时，小陈一直悄悄尾追着我，他见我没有尽到职，心仍吊在半空中，很不是味儿。我走了以后，他在二老家门口踱来踱去，几次伸手去敲门又缩了回来。直到大半夜，看离天亮不远了，反正这个盖子迟早要揭的，既知错就要认错，于是鼓足勇气敲开门。刘二老听了小陈的叙述，爽朗地笑了：“哎呀，我的好小伙子，这点菜算得什么呢？好啊，算你给农业大学缴的学费吧……”说着他疼爱地瞅了瞅小陈，嘴朝外一呶：“对呀，年轻人就要有这股子干劲加钻劲。走，我教你耕田去！”
