Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 16th. Our correspondent reports: The Albanian people, engaged in socialist construction with a pick in one hand and a rifle in the other, have achieved new and remarkable victories on the economic front this year. Compared with 1938 before liberation, Albania's total industrial output value has increased 23 times this year, and the total agricultural output value has increased by about one time. The entire economic front across the country presents a scene of vigorous development.

Recently, frequent production success stories have been reported on the industrial front throughout the country. As early as November, more than 140 factories, mines, and enterprises across the country had completed their production tasks for the Second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960) ahead of schedule. The production level of various economic sectors has greatly improved. According to statistics from the Ministry of Mining and Geology, this year, the total output value of Albania's mining and petroleum industries will reach 3.8 billion leks, more than twice that of 1955. After completing the Second Five-Year Plan's targets in four years and seven months ahead of schedule, the mining and geological departments are expected to complete 100% of this year's mining plan; the petroleum industry will complete 102.6% of the plan, and the geological drilling department will complete 113% of the plan. Currently, the production of various mineral products in Albania has exceeded this year's original targets. It is estimated that by the end of this year, mining and petroleum workers will produce 27,000 more tons of oil, 3,500 tons of chromium ore, 9,000 tons of iron ore, 1,900 tons of asphalt, and 69,000 tons of coal for the country. And drilling workers are expected to over-drill more than 18,000 meters.

By the end of this year, the output of major industrial products across Albania will reach new heights, with coal being about 79 times more than in 1938, chromium ore 41.1 times more, electricity 20 times more, and oil 6.8 times more.

Albania's construction sector has also achieved great success. Throughout the year, construction workers carried out more than 30 capital construction projects, accounting for almost 60% of all projects in the Second Five-Year Plan. Now, they only need nine days to complete the total annual construction volume of 1938. Thanks to the hard work of construction workers, a new batch of factories in Albania has been put into production in 1960, including a copper concentrator, a brewery, four brick and tile factories, and six fruit processing factories.

On the agricultural front, Albania's agricultural cooperative movement has embarked on a path of greater expansion and consolidation this year. According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, to date, the cultivated land of agricultural cooperatives has accounted for 86.5% of the country's total cultivated land area, an expansion of 6% compared with 1959; Durrës, Sarandë, and other districts have reached over 95%. In many districts, not only have cooperatives been established in every village, but the collective wealth of agricultural cooperatives and the income of their members are constantly increasing. For example, the public accumulation fund of agricultural cooperatives in Berat District in central Albania has increased from 160 million leks in 1958 to more than 370 million leks now.

In the process of consolidating and developing the agricultural cooperative movement, various places have also begun to merge small cooperatives into larger ones. At present, among the 1,620 agricultural production cooperatives in the country, 270 cooperatives are formed by merging more than 600 small cooperatives. In order to strengthen the leadership of the large cooperatives, the Albanian Labor Party has sent a large number of outstanding cadres to serve as leaders in the large cooperatives. The large cooperatives have demonstrated even greater superiority in production; the welfare undertakings of many large cooperatives have been newly developed, and they have established public bakeries, kindergartens, and nurseries for busy farming seasons. Some large cooperatives have also begun to implement a pension system.

This year, Albanian agriculture has suffered from cloudy and rainy weather and drought, but it is precisely because the broad countryside has realized cooperation that farmers, under the leadership of the Party, have more effectively fought against natural disasters. On the one hand, they drained water and rushed to plant, carrying out soil and water conservation projects; on the other hand, they expanded the planting area and carried out deep plowing and meticulous cultivation. In Shkodër, Lushnjë, and four other districts alone, the ditches dug and renovated in 1960 stretched for 676,000 meters. During the month of soil and water conservation activities, a total of more than 9,500 square meters of large and small stone dams and more than 14,000 meters of wooden fence dams were built across the country.

This autumn, Albania's agricultural cooperatives have again undergone a severe test in the autumn sowing work. This year, the national wheat sowing area has expanded by nearly 40%, and some districts have even increased it by nearly one time. Since the beginning of autumn, Albania has been experiencing continuous cloudy and rainy weather, which has brought certain difficulties to the autumn sowing work. However, thanks to the various measures taken by the broad masses of farmers, such as draining water and rushing to cultivate, sowing before plowing, and increasing wheat seeds, according to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, as of December 10, the autumn sowing of wheat had completed 95% of the expanded plan. Many districts also actively promoted deep plowing and fertilization during the rush to cultivate and sow. For example, Korçë District deep-plowed more than 3,000 hectares this year, and farmers in Shkodër District collected more than 79,000 metric tons of organic fertilizer.

At the same time, Albania has also achieved great success this year in improving livestock breeds and expanding fruit cultivation. This spring, the country added 3.41 million fruit trees, 540,000 olive trees, and 80,000 citrus trees.

The tremendous achievements Albania has made on the economic front this year are the result of the vigorous labor of the broad masses of the Albanian people under the leadership of the Labor Party. From the beginning of the year, workers and farmers enthusiastically responded to the Party's call, launched socialist labor competitions, and participated in various movements with a lofty communist style. To date, 960 production teams and 10,800 people across the country have participated in the "Socialist Labor Team" and "Socialist Labor Shock Worker" movements; more than 10,000 workers have participated in the "One Plus Two" (one master teaching two apprentices) movement, which aims to improve production technology. The drivers and tractor drivers who participated in the two movements of safe driving of automobiles for 100,000 to 600,000 kilometers without major repairs and plowing of tractors for 10,000 hectares of land without major repairs, have exceeded 2,400 people. In these movements, more than 3,400 advanced workers emerged in the country in the first half of this year alone. At present, 28 people across the country have been awarded the title of "Socialist Labor Hero," and more than 14,000 people have won various medals for their outstanding labor achievements.

    广大人民在劳动党领导下奋勇劳动
    阿尔巴尼亚经济战线取得新的卓越胜利
    一百四十多个厂矿提前完成五年计划　农业合作化运动进一步扩大和巩固
    新华社地拉那16日电　本社记者报道：一手拿镐、一手拿枪进行社会主义建设的阿尔巴尼亚人民，今年又在经济战线上取得了新的卓越的胜利。同解放前1938年相比，阿尔巴尼亚今年的工业总产值增加了二十三倍，农业总产值约增长一倍。全国整个经济战线上呈现出一片蓬勃发展的景象。
    最近以来，全国各地的工业战线上频频传来生产捷报。还在11月份，各地就有一百四十多个厂矿企业提前完成了第二个五年计划
  （1956—1960年）的生产任务。各经济部门的生产水平都有很大的提高。根据矿产地质部的统计，今年，阿尔巴尼亚采矿工业和石油工业的生产总值将达三十八亿里克，即比1955年增长两倍多。采矿和地质部门在以四年零七个月的时间提前完成第二个五年计划的指标后，预计将100％地完成今年的采矿计划；石油工业将以102.6％完成计划，而地质钻探部门将完成计划的113％。目前，阿尔巴尼亚各种矿产品的生产都超过了今年的原订指标。预计，到今年年底，采矿和石油工人将为国家多生产石油二万七千吨，铬矿石三千五百吨，铁矿石九千吨，沥青一千九百吨，煤六万九千吨。而钻探工人预计将可以超额钻井一万八千多米。
    到今年年底，阿尔巴尼亚全国主要工业产品的产量将达到新的高度，其中煤将比1938年约多七十九倍，铬矿石——四十一点一倍，电力——二十倍，石油——六点八倍。
    阿尔巴尼亚的建筑部门也取得了很大的成绩。在整个一年里，建筑工人进行了三十多项基本建设工程，几乎占第二个五年计划全部工程的60％。现在，他们只要九天的时间就可以完成1938年全年建筑总量。由于建筑工人的辛勤劳动，1960年阿尔巴尼亚又有一批新的工厂投入了生产，其中包括选铜厂、啤酒厂、四个砖瓦厂和六个水果加工厂等。
    在农业战线上，今年阿尔巴尼亚的农业合作化运动走上了更加扩大和巩固的道路。根据农业部的统计，到目前为止，农业合作社的耕地已占全国耕地总面积的86.5％，比1959年扩大了6％；都拉斯、萨兰达等区则达到了95％以上。在很多区，不仅村村建社，而且农业合作社的集体财富和社员收入正在不断增长。例如，中部培拉特区农业社的公积金就从1958年的一亿六千万里克增加到现在的三亿七千多万里克。
    在农业合作化运动的巩固和发展的过程中，各地还开始进行小社并大社的工作。现在，全国一千六百二十个农业生产合作社中，有二百七十个社是由六百多个小社合并而成的。为了加强大社的领导，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党派出了大批优秀干部到大社担任领导职务。大社在生产上发挥了更加巨大的优越性；不少大社的福利事业有了新的发展，它们建立了公共面包房、幼儿园和农忙托儿所等。有些大社还开始实行养老金制度。
    今年，阿尔巴尼亚农业曾经遭受到阴雨和干旱，但正是由于广大农村实现了合作化，农民们在党的领导下，更加有效地同自然灾害展开了斗争。他们一方面排水抢种，进行水土保持工程，另一方面又扩大播种面积，进行深耕细作。单是斯库台和卢什?等六个区，1960年开凿和整修的水渠就长达六十七万六千米。在开展水土保持月中，全国兴修的大小石坝共九千五百多平方米，栅栏木坝长一万四千多米。
    今年秋天，阿尔巴尼亚农业合作社又经受了秋播工作的严重考验。今年全国小麦播种面积扩大了近40％，有的区更增加了近一倍。入秋以来，阿尔巴尼亚阴雨绵绵，这给秋播工作带来了一定的困难。但是，由于广大农民采取了排水抢耕、先播后犁、增加麦种等各种措施，根据农业部的统计，到12月10日，秋播的小麦已完成了扩大后的计划的95％。很多区在抢耕播种中，还积极推广深耕施肥。如科尔察区今年就深耕了三千多公顷，斯库台区的农民收集了七万九千多公担有机肥料。
    与此同时，今年阿尔巴尼亚在改良牲畜品种和扩大水果培植方面也取得了很大的成就。今年春季，全国增种了三百四十一万株果树、五十四万株橄榄和八万株柑橘等。
    今年，阿尔巴尼亚在经济战线上所取得的巨大成就，是阿尔巴尼亚广大人民在劳动党的领导下奋勇劳动的结果。从年初一开始，工人和农民们就热情地响应党的号召，展开了社会主义劳动竞赛和参加具有崇高的共产主义风格的各种运动。到目前为止，全国已有九百六十个生产队、一万零八百多人参加了“社会主义劳动队”和“社会主义劳动突击手”运动；有一万多工人参加了以提高生产技术水平为目的的“一加二”（一个师傅带两个徒弟）运动。而参加汽车安全行驶十万至六十万公里不大修和拖拉机耕作一万公顷土地不大修的这两个运动的司机和拖拉机手，已有二千四百多人。在这些运动中，仅今年上半年，全国就涌现了三千四百多名先进工作者。目前，全国有二十八人荣获了“社会主义劳动英雄”称号，一万四千多人由于劳动成绩卓著获得了各种奖章。（附图片）
