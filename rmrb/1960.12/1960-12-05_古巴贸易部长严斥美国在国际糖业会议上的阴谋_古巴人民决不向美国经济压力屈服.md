Latin American People Oppose US Economic Plunder
    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, December 2nd. Cuban Trade Minister Cepero Bonilla, upon returning from the recent eighth meeting of the International Sugar Council in Mexico, gave a speech in Havana, accusing the United States of manipulating the formulation of the International Sugar Agreement. He said that the United States is not only an aggressor against Cuba but also an aggressor against the International Sugar Organization.
    As reported, the International Sugar Council made a temporary decision on November 30th to reduce the export quotas of sugar-producing countries, including Cuba, to the world market by 15% to 10% next year. As is well known, the United States has the voting power to sway the situation in the formulation of the International Sugar Agreement.
    Cepero Bonilla accused the United States of "launching an economic war, attempting to subdue the people who are determined to gain freedom and independence." He said, "We have stated in Mexico that our government is not worried about the United States canceling (sugar) quotas because the people know that this is the price to be paid for carrying out the revolution." He said that the US representatives at the meeting purposefully spread the idea that the Cuban government was not interested in the American market. "Our answer is emphatic: if enjoying this quota means treating the United States as the master, I can tell the council with complete certainty that the United States will not buy even a pound of sugar from Cuba in 1961."
    Bonilla said that if the United States, as Cuba expects, does not buy a ton of sugar from Cuba next year, Cuba will actively promote its sales policy and sell its past quota of three million tons to the US to the world market. He said that Cuba will not be at a disadvantage in the fierce competition to sell sugar.
    Bonilla said that the eighth meeting of the International Sugar Council stipulated a preliminary quota of 2,052,000 tons for Cuba to sell on the world market. However, about 3.5 million tons of sugar from Cuba's next sugar season already has its own reliable market, excluding the United States.

### 古巴贸易部长严斥美国在国际糖业会议上的阴谋  古巴人民决不向美国经济压力屈服

    拉丁美洲人民反对美国经济掠夺
    古巴贸易部长严斥美国在国际糖业会议上的阴谋
    古巴人民决不向美国经济压力屈服
    新华社哈瓦那2日电　参加最近在墨西哥举行的国际糖业理事会第八次会议以后归来的古巴贸易部长塞佩罗·博尼利亚在哈瓦那发表谈话，指责美国操纵国际糖业协定的制定。他说，美国不仅是对古巴的侵略者，也是对国际糖业组织的侵略者。
    据报道，国际糖业理事会已经在11月30日作出暂时决定，把包括古巴在内的生产食糖较多的国家明年向世界市场的食糖出口限额削减15％到10％。如所周知，美国在制定国际糖业协定方面拥有能够左右局势的投票权。
    塞佩罗·博尼利亚指责“美国发动经济战，企图使这个决心获得自由和独立的人民屈服。”他说，“我们已经在墨西哥申明，我国政府并不担心美国取消（食糖）定额，因为人民知道，这是进行革命应该付出的代价。”他说，美国代表在这次会议上别有用心地散布这种说法：古巴政府对美国市场不感兴趣。“我们的回答是斩钉截铁的：如果为了享受这个定额就得把美国当作主人，我可以告诉理事会，完全肯定的是，美国1961年从古巴连一磅糖也买不走。”
    博尼利亚说，如果美国像古巴所预期的那样，明年不从古巴购买一吨糖，古巴将积极推行它的销售政策，把它过去销往美国的三百万吨定额销到世界市场上去。他说，在销售糖的激烈竞争中，古巴不会处于劣势。
    博尼利亚说，国际糖业理事会第八次会议规定古巴在世界市场上销售二百零五万二千吨的初步定额。但是，古巴下一个榨糖季节的生产已经有大约三百五十万吨糖有了自己的可靠市场，其中不包括美国。
