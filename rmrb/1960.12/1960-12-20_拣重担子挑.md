A Glorious Post, Glorious People

    Communist Youth League member Zhang Fucheng, unafraid of poor mountains and bad waters, worked with the people of Dajiashan to turn "Poor Stick Gully" into a rich gully.
    Zhang Fucheng lived near Dajiashan in the eastern suburbs of Liaoyuan City, Jilin. During the enemy and puppet regime period, the trees on Dajiashan were plundered. The Dongliao River flows around Dajiashan. Every rainy season, mountain floods erupt, scouring countless gullies on the slopes, and large amounts of mud, sand, and rocks are pressed down from the mountain, often causing floods in the farmland. Therefore, people call this place "Poor Stick Gully."
    "Don't think the place is bad; as long as you work hard, you can build it successfully." Zhang Fucheng firmly remembered the Party's instructions and persisted in building Dajiashan with the commune members for three years. An important project for transforming Dajiashan was water and soil conservation construction to control soil erosion. Among them, the arduous task of hydrological measurement and flow required hydrometry technology. Zhang Fucheng thought, "Do it," but was afraid he couldn't handle it and would delay the work. If he didn't do it, who else would do such an arduous task? But he asked himself, "Can you bow your head in the face of difficulties? Can you pick the easy and avoid the heavy in the face of difficulties? Can you push the difficulties to others? No." Zhang Fucheng finally undertook this glorious and arduous task. He humbly learned from others and worked hard. After ten days of painstaking effort, he not only mastered hydrometry technology but also successfully completed the task.

    拣重担子挑
    共青团员张福成，不怕穷山恶水，和大架山人民一道，把“穷棒子沟”变成富沟。
    张福成家住吉林辽源市东郊的大架山附近。大架山在敌伪统治时期，山上树木被掠夺净尽。东辽河绕大架山流过，每逢雨季，山洪暴发，坡地冲出无数沟壑，大量泥沙石块压下山来，良田里经常被泛滥成灾。因此，人们把这里叫做“穷棒子沟”。
    “别看地方不好，只要下苦功夫，就能够建设成功。”张福成牢牢地记住了党的指示，三年如一日和社员们一起坚持在大架山建设。改造大架山的重要工程是进行水土保持工程建设，控制水土流失。其中水文测流这个艰苦的任务，还要有测流技术才行。张福成想，干吧，又怕拿不起来，耽误了工作；不干吧，这样艰巨的工作又让谁干呢？但他又自己问自己：“能在困难面前低头吗？能在困难面前挑轻躲重吗？能把困难推给别人吗？不能。”张福成终于承担起光荣而又艰巨的任务。他虚心向别人学习，刻苦钻研，经过十天煞费苦心的努力，不仅掌握了测流技术，还顺利地完成了任务。
