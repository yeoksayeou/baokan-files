    The Experience of the Wanrong County Jiacun Commune Party Committee in Helping Production Team Cadres Improve Their Leadership Skills

    The Wanrong County Jiacun People's Commune Party Committee in Shanxi Province, recognizing that the production team is the frontline of agricultural production, has vigorously helped production team cadres improve their leadership skills and improve agricultural production. Over the past year, it has achieved great results and explored some experiences.

            Finding the Reason

    Last year, the wheat production of Jiacun People's Commune was lagging behind in Wanrong County. After checking and summarizing the work, the commune Party committee found that the main reason was the imbalance in the work of each production team. The backward teams dragged down the "legs" of the advanced teams, reducing the average yield. Therefore, it was considered that improving the backward teams, raising the intermediate teams, and making them catch up with the advanced teams was the key; and improving the leadership level of the production teams was a decisive link.

    How to improve the leadership level of the production team? The captain is the head of the team, so we must start with the captain first. Therefore, Yao Xiaoxian, the first secretary, personally led the production team leaders to visit the advanced communes to learn from their experience. After visiting for a few days, after discussion, some captains still had no confidence in striving for advancement. Li Zhengbao, the captain of the third team of the Wu Xue Management District, said: "No, no, our conditions are much worse. It is reasonable that the wheat yield is low."

    Yao Xiaoxian felt that Li Zhengbao's thinking was not clear, so he launched a debate among the production team leaders on this issue. Li Dongshan, also the captain of the Wu Xue Management District, said to Li Zhengbao: "The conditions of our two teams are similar, but why did our team produce 166 jin per mu, while your third team only produced 132 jin, a full 20% less. What is the reason for this?" Facts are more powerful than anything else. Li Dongshan's two sentences left Li Zhengbao speechless for a while. He thought seriously for a while and said: "You, as the captain, are energetic and your feet are on the field; I, as the captain, am not energetic and my feet are on miscellaneous things. I didn't focus on production, which is a big shortcoming." After a pause, he said: "The help from the leadership is also important. Deputy Secretary Li Yaoxian often goes to the team to help you plan; no one helps my team, and there are really not many ways to do it." The captains compared the teams with each other, and everyone felt that the two points Li Zhengbao said were of universal significance. In the future, to be a captain, one must learn from Li Dongshan and first put his feet on the field; the commune and district cadres must learn from Li Yaoxian and go down to the teams to lead production, then there will be no worry that grain production will not increase.

  	Improving the System

    The commune Party committee accepted the captains' suggestions and immediately implemented the method of sending commune and district cadres to the teams as "advisers." All 145 production teams in the commune sent 145 cadres as advisers. The captains were very happy, and they grasped production even more tightly. However, problems arose again: Xue Jingyi, the captain of the first team of the North Xue Management District, almost every day pushed the bowl with one hand and rang the bell to urge people to go to the field with the other. He hated that the cattle plowed the land too slowly, and he whipped them hard; when he saw the commune members, he often criticized them for talking and forgetting to work. He thought: As long as I work hard and keep a close watch on the commune members, I will definitely be able to improve production. Unexpectedly, it was not enough to only focus on production without solving various specific problems related to production and without caring about the commune members' thoughts and lives. As a result, some commune members could not keep up, and production work still fell behind. He was anxious and whipped the cattle even harder, and criticized people even more severely. The commune members were dissatisfied and gave him their opinions face to face. He was so angry that he couldn't help saying: "It's really difficult to be a captain!"

    Xie Hengfa, the stationed cadre, saw Xue Jingyi's difficulties, and the commune Party committee also found that the leadership method of only managing production and not taking care of the overall situation was a common problem in the leadership of most production teams at that time. They summarized the "three grasps" experience of the third production team of Wang Yazhuang Management District in grasping production, grasping life, and grasping political and ideological education, and required production team leaders to learn three sets of skills and production teams to have three sets of systems, and specially trained the captains. During the training, on the one hand, they imparted specific experience and introduced specific methods, and on the other hand, they organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's article "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work." Since then, each production team quickly implemented a production management system of making a plan every ten days and checking every five days, based on the problems existing in production; and based on the problems existing in life, formulated a democratic management of life system and a system for strengthening political and ideological work. Once the system was improved and the leadership methods of the captains were improved, the production enthusiasm of the commune members was greatly improved, and they rushed to work ahead of the captains. Xue Jingyi's leadership of the production team also improved, and he happily said: "Personal effort is limited, and the 'three grasps' system turns dirt into gold. Everyone must work hard."

          Grasping Preparations Early

    The commune members' enthusiasm was boosted. The labor attendance rate has been greatly improved. With more people working, there is a greater need for tools, but the production team did not guard against this. As a result, many production teams had the phenomenon of "finding a gun before the battle" and "sharpening a gun before the battle" in important farm work. The sixth team of the Tongai Management District organized 60% of the labor force to prepare the land, but as soon as they went to work, the commune members came to the captain one by one to ask for hoes and mattocks. Captain Niu Jiao was anxious for a while, and loudly questioned: "Do you still want the captain to prepare the furniture for your use?" The captain's criticism was reasonable, and the commune members' feedback was also true. Commune member Liu Suotong said: "In the past, those who went to the fields to work were mostly men and women with full labor power. Now everyone's awareness has been improved, and all the full and half labor power have gone to the battle. However, tools cannot be bought for a while. Who do you want the commune members to turn to?" Captain Niu Jiao felt that it was indeed reasonable.

    Yao Xiaoxian, the first secretary of the commune, was also the deputy captain of the sixth team. After learning about this situation, he felt that industrial production should grasp both production and preparation. Why shouldn't agricultural production grasp preparation early? If we only make plans and systems without preparing all the material resources needed to realize the plans, how can the work not be passive? He said: "We must grasp the preparation link."

    Yao Xiaoxian then said to Captain Niu Jiao: "I'm thinking that in addition to the ten-day short-term arrangement, there must also be a long-term plan. As the saying goes, 'A man who has no long-term considerations must have near worries.' Right now, production tools are hindering us, but in a few days, some other problems may arise!" He put forward a set of long-term plans and proposed the idea of preparing early. The commune members immediately discussed it. First, they started with production and calculated what work needed to be done based on the year's leap-forward targets, how much production material needed to be added, when it would be used, and how much would be used. They also calculated the breeding work and believed that although there was no need to add things often in this area, they had to "store soil and accumulate grass"; if they didn't store soil, they wouldn't be able to cushion the pens on cloudy and rainy days, and the livestock wouldn't be able to lie down and rest well, which would affect manure accumulation; they also had to chop more grass to prevent the troughs from being empty during busy farming seasons. In addition, the canteen's charcoal and finished grain, and the commune members' personal supplies, such as shoes, socks, and clothing, should also be prepared early, so that they can be set aside in slack seasons and used in busy seasons. In order to comprehensively prepare, the team also added a logistics deputy captain to specifically lead this work.

    The commune Party committee promoted Captain Niu Jiao's approach, and leaders of all 145 production teams formulated such long-term plans and added logistics captains. In order to ensure the realization of the production team's logistics supply plan, the commune Party committee also held a contact meeting between the supply and marketing general store, the commune-run industry, and the production team to implement the items that the production team needed to purchase one by one. This spring, the production team needed to harrow eighty fans, but the supply and marketing general store could not purchase them, so the commune-run industry went up the mountain to cut branches and quickly wove them for timely supply. The commune-run industry produced summer harvesting sickles, but lacked pig iron, so the supply and marketing general store purchased scrap copper and iron to ensure the timely supply of eight thousand sickles.

	  Agriculture as the Main Focus

    Soon, the contradiction between diversified management and agriculture as the main focus was discovered. The production team is the frontline of the people's commune for realizing comprehensive development of five industries, comprehensively organizing production and life. Usually, the labor force is divided into different areas, each managing its own line, which can cope, but during the busy farming season, there are too few people in the fields, unable to keep up with the season. The commune Party committee knew that this problem was important, and every time during the important seasons of spring planting, summer management, and autumn harvest and autumn planting, they put forward the call of "adding troops and generals" or "going all out" to the production teams based on Chairman Mao's idea of "concentrating superior forces to fight annihilation battles." The production team leaders also felt that the leadership was right. The four production teams of Wang Yazhuang Management District counted and found that the number of strong male full-laborers in non-field production was almost as many as those in the fields, but it was very difficult to transfer these people to the fields for production. It always felt that although the industries were different, none of them could be spared! Later, after careful analysis, they clarified that the various industries in non-field production also had several different situations: some could be temporarily suspended, some could be done by everyone in passing, and some could be handled by weak labor after comprehensive "storing grain and accumulating grass." Based on this analysis, experiments were first conducted in the eighth production team of Yangguo Management District, and it worked. When repairing the land to catch up with the sowing season, the work of the sewing, milling, and straw cutting groups, which had already been ahead of schedule, was temporarily suspended, and eight people were transferred out; four strong laborers were replaced from the canteen and breeding group, which had stored grain (into flour) and accumulated grass (chopped grass); and three laborers were freed up for carrying water and cutting grass by having everyone do it in passing. In this way, excluding the four people who were replaced by weaker labor, the field production increased by more than 33%. If only the strong labor force was counted, it increased by almost half. Therefore, the work that was originally planned to be completed in ten days was completed in five days. The commune Party committee felt that this was a good way to correctly implement the policy of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing, so they comprehensively promoted this method according to the different situations of the busy, very busy, and extremely busy farming seasons. That is, in less busy times, comprehensively develop diversified management and actively "store grain and accumulate grass" to advance the work; in busy times, do some in passing and suspend some to support agricultural production; and in extremely busy times, go all out to ensure agricultural production. The production team leaders said that this system was a "good method" after it had been implemented for half a year.

          Collective Leadership

    The production team's work became more and more detailed, and the amount of work that needed to be specifically planned and arranged by the captains also increased. The political and ideological education of the commune members also needed to be further strengthened. Therefore, it was common for the production captain to be unable to manage everything alone. The commune and district cadres who went to the team could not "advise" very comprehensively either. In order to further strengthen the Party's leadership over the production teams and further improve the leadership level of the production teams, the commune Party committee began to adjust the Party member cadres of each production team in a planned way from March of this year, and strengthened the work of developing Party members and League members. Party and League groups were established with the team as a unit. Deep propaganda and education were carried out by reading newspapers on the ground, Party and League members making close friends, and individual visits and connections to improve the masses' thinking. At the same time, each production team, with the captain and deputy captain as the core, absorbed experienced old farmers to establish and improve the collective leadership of the team committee, thereby further improving the leadership level of the production team. Over the past year, twenty-eight backward teams have been completely upgraded, and six have jumped to become advanced teams; twenty production teams in the intermediate state have also been upgraded to advanced teams. At present, the number of advanced production teams in the entire commune has increased from 40% at the beginning of the year to 66%.

### 到前线指挥所去  万荣县贾村公社党委帮助生产队干部提高领导水平的经验

    到前线指挥所去
    万荣县贾村公社党委帮助生产队干部提高领导水平的经验
    山西万荣县贾村人民公社党委，认定生产队是农业生产的第一线，就大力帮助生产队干部提高领导水平，搞好农业生产，一年来，取得了很大成绩，也摸索到一些经验。
            找到原因
    去年，贾村人民公社的小麦生产，在万荣县是落后的。公社党委经过检查总结工作，发现主要原因是各生产队工作不平衡，后进队拉了先进队的“腿”，降低了平均产量。因此认为改进落后队，提高中间队，使它们都赶上先进队是个关键；而提高生产队的领导水平，又是决定的一环。
    怎样提高生产队的领导水平呢？队长是一队之长，先得从队长着手。于是，第一书记姚孝先同志就亲自带领生产队长们一块到先进的公社去参观取经。参观了几天，回来一讨论，好些队长对争先进仍然没有信心。吴薛管理区三队队长李正保说：“不行，不行，咱的条件差得多，小麦产量低，也有道理。”
    姚孝先觉得李正保思想不通，就发动生产队长们辩论这个问题。李东山也是吴薛管理区的队长，他向李正保说：“咱们两个队的条件差不多，可为啥我们一队每亩产了一百六十六斤，你们三队才产了一百三十二斤，整整少产了20％。这是什么道理？”事实比什么都有力，李东山两句话问得李正保一时答不上来。他认真地想了一会，说：“你当队长干劲大，两只脚踩在田里；我当队长干劲小，两只脚踩在零杂事里，没狠抓生产，这是个大缺点。”停了一会，他又说：“领导上帮助也要紧，副支书李耀先常下队帮助你们谋划；我这队没人帮助，自己的办法实在不多。”队长们把队与队对比了一下，大家也觉得李正保说的那两点有普遍意义，今后当队长要学李东山，先得把脚踩在田里；社、区干部要学李耀先下队领导生产，那就不愁粮食不增产了。
  	健全制度
    公社党委接受了队长们的建议，立即实行了社、区干部一律下队当“参谋”的办法。全公社一百四十五个生产队，就派了一百四十五个干部当参谋。队长们满心高兴，生产也就抓得更紧了。可是问题又发生了：北薛管理区一队队长薛敬义，几乎每天都是一只手推碗，一只手就打钟催人下地。犁地嫌牛慢，鞭上使劲打；见了社员又常批评他们光顾说话，忘了干活。他心想：只要自己出力，再把社员们抓紧，就定能把生产搞好。没料到光抓生产不解决与生产有关的各种具体问题，不关心社员们的思想和生活，还是不行。结果，有的社员跟不上来，生产工作还是落在后头。他心里着急，打牛打的更凶，批评人也批评的更重。社员不满意，当面给他提意见。他气得没法，说：“这个队长真难当呀！”
    驻队干部谢恒发看出了薛敬义的难处，公社党委也发现了只管生产、不顾全面的领导方法，是当时多数生产队领导上的通病。就总结了王亚庄管理区第三生产队抓生产、抓生活、抓政治思想教育的“三抓”经验，要求生产队长们都要学会三套本领，生产队都要有三套制度，并专门集训了队长。在训练中，一面传授具体经验，介绍具体办法，一面又组织大家学习毛主席《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》的文章。此后，各生产队就很快地针对生产上存在的问题，实行了十天一计划、五天一检查的管理生产制度；又根据生活上存在的问题，订出了民主管理生活的制度和加强政治思想工作等制度。制度一健全，队长们的领导方法一改进，社员的生产积极性就大大提高了，不等队长说话，就抢在前头干活。薛敬义领导的生产队，工作也有了起色，他高兴的说：“个人发狠，力有限，‘三抓’制度土变金，要大家都发狠才行。”
          早抓准备
    社员们的劲头鼓起来了。劳动出勤率大大提高了，干活的人多了，需要的工具也就多，这一点生产队又没有防住。结果好些生产队在重要的农活上，又出现了“临阵找枪”和“临阵磨枪”的现象。通爱管理区第六队，组织了60％的劳力上阵整地，可是一出工社员们一个个都来向队长要锄要镢头。队长牛角一时发急，就大声责问：“手头用的家具，还叫队长给你们预备。”队长批评的有理，社员们反映的情况也是实情，社员刘锁同说：“往年下地干活的多是男女全劳力，现在大伙的觉悟都提高了，全、半劳力都出了阵，工具又一时买不到，你说这事该叫社员找谁去？”牛角队长一听确实有理。
    公社党委第一书记姚孝先兼着六队副队长，他了解了这种情况，觉得工业生产要一手抓生产，一手抓准备，农业生产为什么就不早抓准备呢？只订计划、订制度，而不准备实现计划所需要的一切物质资料，工作怎能不被动呢？他说：“一定要抓住准备这一环。”
    姚孝先接着对牛角队长说：“我寻思除了十天的短安排，还得有长计划，俗话说‘人无远虑，必有近忧’，眼下是生产工具挡了手，过几天还不定又冒出什么问题来呢！”他说出了一套长计划，并提出早准备的意见，社员们当场就合计起来。先从生产上算起，根据全年的跃进指标，需要做那些工作，需要增添多少生产资料，什么时候用，用多少。从饲养工作上也合计了一番，认为这方面虽不需要常添东西，可也得“屯土积草”；不屯土，天阴下雨垫不了圈，牲口卧不下，歇不好，又影响积肥；草也得多铡一些，以防农忙时空了槽。另外，对食堂的烧炭和成品粮，社员个人的生活用品，诸如鞋袜衣服等等，也要早备好，做到闲时置下忙时用。为了全面做好准备，队里又增添了后勤副队长，专门领导这项工作。
    公社党委推广了牛角队长的做法，领导一百四十五个生产队都订了这样的长计划，增设了后勤队长。为了保证生产队后勤供应计划的实现，公社党委还召开了供销总店、社办工业和生产队的联系会议，把生产队需要购买的东西一一落实下来。今年春天，生产队需要耱八十扇，供销总店采购不来，社办工业就上山割荆条，迅速编制，及时供应。社办工业生产夏收镰刀，缺乏生铁，供销总店就收购了废铜废铁，保证了八千张镰刀按时供应。	  农田为主
    不久，又发现了多种经营和农田为主的矛盾。生产队是人民公社实现五业并举，全面组织生产和生活的最前线，行行业业或大或小样样俱全。平时，劳动力分兵把口，各管一行，还能对付，可农忙时却显得田间人少，赶不上节令。公社党委知道这个问题重要，每逢春种、夏管和秋收秋种的重要节令上，就根据毛主席“集中优势兵力，打歼灭战”的思想，向生产队提出“添兵添将”或“全力以赴”的号召。生产队长们也觉得领导说得对。王亚庄管理区四个生产队统计了一下，非田间生产的精壮男全劳力差不多和田间一样多，可是要抽这些人下田生产，又十分难办，总觉得行行业业虽不一样，可哪个也少不了呀！后来，仔细一分析，摸清了非田间生产的各行各业，也有几种不同的情况：有些能暂时停办，有些能众人捎办，还有些是全面“屯粮积草”以后，用弱劳动力也能代办。根据这种分析，在杨郭管理区第八生产队先进行了试验，果然能行。在整修土地赶下种节令时，就暂时停办了工作已经赶前一步的缝纫、磨面和铡草组的工作，调出了八个人；又用以弱换强的办法，从屯了粮（已成面粉）积了草（切碎的草）的食堂和饲养组里，换出了四个强劳力；又用大家动手捎带干的办法，腾出了担水的、割草的等三个劳动力。这一来，田间生产除去以弱换强的四个人不计外，还净增加了33％多，如果单以精壮劳动力来计算，差不多就增添了一半。因此，原计划十天完成的活计，五天就全部完成。公社党委觉得这是一种正确贯彻执行以粮为纲全面发展方针的好办法，便根据农时季节小忙、大忙和特忙等几种不同情况，全面推广了这种办法。这就是小忙时全面发展多种经营，并积极“屯粮积草”，把工作赶前一步；大忙时，则捎办一些，停办一些，支援农田生产；特忙时则全力以赴，保证农田生产。这制度执行了半年，生产队长们都说是“好法子”。
          集体领导
    生产队工作越来越细，需要队长具体计划安排的工作也越来越多，对社员的政治思想教育工作也需要进一步加强。因此，生产队长一人全拿，就常常顾此失彼。下队的社、区干部也不能“参谋”的很周全。公社党委为了进一步加强党对生产队的领导，进一步提高生产队的领导水平，从今年3月开始，就有计划地给各生产队调整了党员干部，加强了发展党员和团员的工作。并以队为单位，建立了党小组和团小组。通过地头读报，党团员广交知心朋友，个别访问串联等方式，进行深入的宣传教育，提高群众的思想。同时，各生产队以正副队长为核心，吸收有经验的老农参加，建立与健全了队委会的集体领导，从而进一步提高了生产队的领导水平。一年来，二十八个落后队已完全升级，并有六个跃为先进队；中间状态的生产队也有二十个升为先进队。现下，全公社的先进生产队，已由年初的40％，提高到66％。
