    The introduction of the concept of "population" into the field of plant physiology, and the gradual development of research on crop population physiology, is one of the major achievements we have gained in the revolution of research direction. In the past, the objects of plant physiology research were individual plants, or even parts of individuals (individual detached organs, tissues, or cells). The materials were randomly selected, and rarely were they crops; even if crops were used, the methods were limited to pot experiments or so-called "field experiments" on very small areas. In such research, individuals were often isolated, ignoring the mutual influence between individuals. Crops in large-scale field production are dense populations. Although a population is composed of individuals, it has produced new qualitative characteristics and is no longer a simple sum of individuals. Studying only individual physiology often cannot solve problems in agricultural production because it is extremely one-sided, a practice of "seeing only the part, not the whole, seeing only the trees, not the forest."

    A population is composed of individuals, and the structure and characteristics of the population are determined by the number of individuals and their growth and development. The growth and development of individuals, in turn, fully reflects the influence of the population, because the environmental conditions within the population, such as light, temperature, humidity, air composition and wind speed, soil conditions, etc., change with the change in the number of individuals and their growth. The change in environmental conditions, in turn, affects the growth and development of individuals.

    A population is not simply the sum of individuals. There are many specific examples of this. For example, the yield of a population per unit area does not increase indefinitely with the increase in the number of individuals. Ignoring this point will lead to the illusion of infinitely increasing the sowing rate. The water consumption pattern of a population is the same. When the density increases several times, the water consumption does not increase several times, and in some cases, it does not even increase. This is because when the density increases, the transpiration intensity per unit leaf area decreases, the diurnal process of transpiration changes, and the ground evaporation between plants also decreases. Furthermore, the light energy function of a population is also different from that of an individual, producing many new characteristics and new problems. The distribution of light energy in the upper and lower layers of the population, the structural characteristics of the population (such as the distribution of total leaf area in each layer, the size, arrangement, angle, reflection, and transmission characteristics of the leaves) are all important factors determining the overall light energy utilization in the field.

    Thus, it can be seen that from individuals to populations, quantitative changes lead to qualitative changes. Under the concept of "population," at least the following four aspects are included: First, the number of individuals and the growth and development of individuals; Second, the environment inside the population, including the microclimate between plants above ground and the soil environment underground, which is the indirect influence between individuals; Third, the direct influence between individuals, such as interaction through root secretions; Fourth, the relationship between the population and external environmental conditions. The latter three are new qualitative characteristics of the population, and the first is also deeply influenced by them.

    The contradiction between population and individuals is specifically manifested in the contradiction between the number of ears and the size of ears in rice and wheat fields, which is a well-known fact. Their contradiction is also reflected in the requirements for cultivation conditions.

    How much does the contradiction between population and individuals play a role in production and cultivation? This depends on the specific cultivation conditions. Generally speaking, three basic contradictions run through the field production process from beginning to end: the contradiction between plants and environmental conditions, the contradiction between population and individuals, and the contradiction between various organs within the individual. Which contradiction plays a leading role in it varies with different locations, cultivation conditions, and different times.

    First, let's talk about the nature of contradictions under different cultivation conditions. General field production conditions and high-yield experimental field conditions are different. In general fields, the main contradiction lies between the plants' requirements for environmental conditions and the actual environmental conditions. Here, fertilizer and water are often insufficient, even lacking, and the sowing rate is often low rather than high. The actual density in the field has not yet reached the appropriate range, so the contradiction between population and individuals does not become the main contradiction. The solution to the above main contradiction is to appropriately increase the sowing rate, explore all possible sources of fertilizer and water, universally increase fertilizer application, and supply water in a timely manner; in a word, it is to continuously promote and improve step by step. The situation in high-yield experimental fields is different. Fertilizer and water are basically guaranteed. In order to maximize the yield-increasing potential of close planting, the sowing rate is often increased to near the upper limit of the reasonable range. In this way, light becomes a limiting factor for obtaining high yields, and the contradiction between population and individuals becomes the main contradiction. How to use fertilizer and water in high-yield fields is mainly carried out around overcoming the contradiction between population and individuals. Measures should be taken to combine promotion and control, not only in the relationship between population and individuals, but also in the relationship between various parts and organs of the individual.

    The necessity of adapting to local conditions and treating them differently is very clear in the issue of reasonable close planting. Practice has proven that appropriately increasing the sowing rate in the field is an effective measure to increase yield. However, when fertilizer and water are relatively guaranteed, the appropriate range of the sowing rate is widened, and high yields can be obtained with a lower sowing rate. This is because sufficient fertilizer and water conditions can increase tillering and improve the tillering rate. In general, experimental institutions conduct close planting experiments mostly on fields with relatively sufficient fertilizer and water conditions. As a result, the yields of lower sowing rates and higher sowing rates are often leveled or differ little. If this result is promoted to field production regardless of the conditions, it will be a mistake of "sparse planting theory."

    In the process of plant growth and development, the nature of the main contradiction is different in different developmental stages. Taking the case of high-yield rice and wheat fields as an example, from the time the seeds are sown in the field, there is opposition between population and individuals in the cultivation process, but their contradiction has not yet surfaced and intensified. At this time, the main contradiction lies in the contradiction between seed germination and the moisture, temperature, and ventilation conditions in the soil environment. The solutions are pre-sowing irrigation, soil loosening, and the use of appropriate sowing periods and appropriate sowing depths. After emergence, with the consumption of nutrients in the seeds, the plants' demand for fertilizer increases day by day. If we meet their requirements in this regard, the individuals will gradually grow larger, and the population will also develop accordingly. Then, the contradiction between individuals and populations gradually emerges. In the contradiction between population and individuals, the individual occupies the main aspect of the contradiction in the early stage, because promoting the growth of individuals also promotes the development of the population. After that, around the jointing stage, the individuals rapidly increase in size, and mutual shading becomes increasingly serious. The situation changes significantly, and finally, a situation emerges where factors that are beneficial to individual growth become unfavorable to individual growth, and conditions that promote population development become conditions that limit population development. For example, the large leaf area of a single plant was originally a tool for individuals to fully utilize light energy, and the result of its work was that the individuals grew rapidly, thereby also promoting the growth of the population. However, at this time, the excessive leaf area caused shading and closure, showing many unfavorable effects, and finally became a factor limiting the growth and development of individuals and populations. In this way, the contradiction between individuals and populations intensifies to the most acute form and becomes the main contradiction in the field. The contradiction between plants and environmental conditions and the contradiction between various organs of plants are all under its control. In the contradiction between individuals and populations, the main aspect of the contradiction lies in the population. When resolving the contradiction, we should focus more on the population and maintain the population at a relatively stable and prosperous level, and sometimes we need to appropriately limit the growth of individuals. In the later stage of growth, because the vegetative organs of the individuals gradually stop growing, the population is basically stable, and the contradiction between them temporarily eases. The main contradiction often shifts to the contradiction between internal organs of the individual. At this time, an important issue is how to concentrate the substances created and stored in the vegetative organs to the reproductive organs in a timely and greater manner. At this time, a specific contradiction arises: the reproductive organs require more nutrients, while the vegetative organs still require to maintain certain functions. If the leaves or stems get less nutrients and output more, it will cause the plant to "lose strength" in the later stage, senesce prematurely, which is not conducive to grain filling, or the stems are thin and easily lodging. If there is too much nitrogen fertilizer at this time, it will cause the plant to "grow excessively lush," and the grains cannot develop fully.

    农作物的群体和个体的辩证关系
    把群体概念引进植物生理学领域中，逐步开展了作物群体生理的研究，这是我们在研究方向的革命中所获得的重大成果之一。过去植物生理学研究的对象都是植物个体，甚至是个体的某一部分（个别离体的器官、组织或细胞），在材料上是随意选择的，极少是农作物；即使用了农作物，而在方法上也局限于盆栽或极小面积的所谓“田间试验”。在这样的研究中，往往把个体孤立起来，忽视了个体和个体之间的相互影响。大田生产中的作物，是密集在一起的群体。群体虽由个体组成，但已产生了新的质的特点而不再是单纯的个体总和。只研究个体生理，常不能解决农业生产中的问题，因为它带有极大的片面性，是“只看见局部，不看见全体，只看见树木，不看见森林”的做法。
    群体由个体组成，群体的结构及特性是由个体的数量及其生长发育状况所决定的，而个体的生长发育状况又充分地反映了群体的影响，这是因为群体内部的环境条件，如光照、温度、湿度、空气成份和风速、土壤条件等，是随着个体数目及其生长量的变化而变化，环境条件的改变又反过来影响个体的生长发育。
    群体不单是个体的单纯相加，这点，具体的例证很多。如单位面积上群体的产量并不是随着个体数目的增加而无限度的增加。忽视这一点，就会引起无限增加播种量的幻想。群体耗水的规律也一样，当密度成倍增加时，耗水量不是成倍增加，有的情况下甚至并不增加。这是因为，当密度提高时，以单位叶面积计算的蒸腾强度减低了，蒸腾作用日进程改变了，株间的地面蒸发也减少了。再如，群体的光能作用，也不同于个体，产生了许多新的特性和新的问题，群体上下层光能的分布、群体的结构特性（如总叶面积在各层的分配、叶子的大小、排列、角度、反光和透光特性等）都是决定大田整个光能利用问题的重要因素。
    由此可见，从个体到群体，量变产生了质变。在群体的概念下，至少包含了下列四个内容：一、个体的数量和个体的生长发育状况；二、群体内部的环境，包括地上的株间小气候和地下的土壤环境，是个体之间的间接影响；三、个体和个体的直接影响，例如通过根的分泌物相互作用；四、群体和外界环境条件的关系。后面这三条，都是群体新的质的特点，而第一条也深受它们的影响。
    群体和个体的矛盾，在稻田和麦田中，具体表现在穗多和穗大的矛盾上，这是大家都已知道了的事实。它们的矛盾，也表现在对栽培条件的要求上。
    群体和个体的矛盾，在生产栽培中起着多大的作用？这要看具体的栽培条件而定。总的说来，田间的生产过程中自始至终贯穿三种基本的矛盾：植物和环境条件的矛盾，群体和个体的矛盾，个体内部各器官间的矛盾。哪一种矛盾在其中起着主导的作用，是随着不同的地点栽培条件和不同的时间而有所不同的。
    先谈谈不同栽培条件下的矛盾性质。一般的大田生产条件和高产试验田的条件是不相同的。在一般的大田中，主要的矛盾在于植物对环境条件的要求和现实的环境条件之间的矛盾上。这里，肥、水常常不够充足、甚至是缺乏的，播种量常常是偏低而不是偏高，田间实际的茂密度还没有到达合适的范围，所以群体和个体的矛盾不成其为主要的矛盾。解决上述主要矛盾的办法是适当增加播种量，发掘一切可能发掘的肥源和水源，普增肥料，及时供水；一句话，是要不断促进，步步提高。高产试验田的情况就不同了，肥、水基本上是保证了的，为了尽量发挥密植的增产潜力，播种量往往提高到合理范围的上限附近，这样光照成为获得高产的限制因素，群体和个体的矛盾也就成为主要的矛盾了，高产田中的如何用肥用水，主要是围绕着克服群体和个体的矛盾而进行的，要采取促进和控制相结合的办法，既有促进，又有控制，不仅在群体和个体的关系上，而且在个体各部位、各器官的关系上也都是如此。
    因地制宜、分别对待的必要性，在合理密植问题上看得很明白。实践证明，大田中适当增加播种量是一个增产的有效措施，但是当肥、水较有保证的时候，播种量的合适范围放宽了，用较低的播种量也可以得到丰产，这是因为充足的肥水条件能增加分蘖并提高分蘖成穗率的缘故。一般试验机构进行密植试验，大都是在肥水等条件比较充足的田地上，结果常常是较低播种量和较高播种量的在产量上拉平或者相差无几。假使把这种结果不问条件如何就推广到大田生产中去，就会犯“稀植论”的错误。
    在植物的生长发育过程中，在不同的发育时期，主要矛盾的性质是有区别的。以稻麦高产田的情况为例，从种子播在田中起，栽培过程中就有了群体和个体的对立，但是它们的矛盾还没有表面化和激化，这时主要的矛盾在于种子萌芽和土壤环境中的水分、温度、通气条件的矛盾，解决的方法是播前灌水、松土、采用合适的播种期和合适的播种深度等。出苗后随着种子中养料的消耗，植物对肥料的要求日益增加了，假使我们满足了它们对这方面的要求，个体就逐渐长大，群体也跟着发展起来，于是个体和群体的矛盾逐渐显示出来。在群体和个体的矛盾中，初期个体占着矛盾的主要方面的地位，因为促进个体的生长从而也就促进了群体的发展。此后，大约到拔节期前后，个体迅速增大，彼此互相遮荫日趋严重，情况发生了显著的变化，终于出现了这样的局面，利于个体生长的因素转化为不利于个体生长的因素，促进群体发展的条件变成为限制群体发展的条件，比如原先单株具有广大的叶面积是个体充分利用光能的工具，靠它工作的结果，使个体快速生长，从而也促进了群体的生长，但是到了这时候，过大的叶面积造成遮光郁闭，显出了许多不利的影响，终于成为限制个体和群体生长、发育的因素。这样，个体和群体的矛盾激化到最尖锐的形式，成为田间主要的矛盾。植物和环境条件的矛盾、植物诸器官之间的矛盾都处在它支配之下。在个体和群体的矛盾中，矛盾的主要方面在于群体了。解决矛盾时要更多地把着眼点放在群体一方，维持群体在一个比较稳定而且繁荣的水平上，有时需要适当限制个体的生长。到了生长后期，由于个体营养器官逐渐停止生长，群体也基本上稳定了，它们之间的矛盾暂时缓和下来，主要的矛盾常转移到个体内部器官间的矛盾上，这时一个重要的问题是如何使营养器官中所造成和贮积的物质及时地更多地向生殖器官集中。这时具体出现的一个矛盾是：生殖器官要求吸取较多的养料，而营养器官也仍要求维持一定的功能，假如叶子或茎秆中获得的养料少，输出多，则会引起后期植株“脱力”，过早衰老，不利灌浆，或茎秆细弱，容易倒伏。如此时氮肥过多，又会引起植株的“贪青”，谷粒不能发育饱满。
