Sink the Roots of Leadership Deep into the Groups
Kunming Iron and Steel Plant's Iron Smelting Plant Improves the Leadership Level of Groups in Terms of Strength Allocation, Work Methods, and Business Capabilities

(Reported by Yunnan Daily) The Party Committee of Kunming Iron and Steel Company's Iron Smelting Plant earnestly focuses on groups, giving full play to the role of groups in production, and powerfully promoting the sustained leap forward in production.

When the Iron Smelting Plant Party Committee began to focus on group work, it organized a dedicated force to conduct a general investigation and understanding in various workshops and teams. As a result, they grasped the overall picture of all production groups in the plant. Through repeated and careful investigation and ranking, they could be roughly divided into three types. The first type: the leadership core has basically formed; the second type: the leadership core is not strong enough, lacks management systems, and although some new atmospheres have emerged in ideology and production, they are not solid enough; the third type: the leadership core has not been formed, and ideology and production are still in a backward state. In response to the specific situation of the groups, the Iron Smelting Plant Party Committee made appropriate adjustments to the leadership strength of the groups on the basis of investigation and ranking; the new group leaders are mostly Party members, Communist Youth League members, and activists who connect with the masses. They are ideologically advanced, care about the collective, and are supported by the masses. At the same time, a group leadership core with activists as the backbone was also formed.

Through investigation and ranking, they also found that although the vast majority of group leaders were very enthusiastic and had close ties with the masses, they lacked experience in leading groups, and their work methods were relatively simple and crude. Therefore, the Party's resolutions could not be quickly implemented among the masses, and the masses' wishes could not be reflected in a timely manner. In response to this actual situation, after adjusting and strengthening the group leadership and improving the organization, the Iron Smelting Plant Party Committee, in order to generally improve the ideological level and leadership ability of the group leaders, and help them correctly understand the importance of group work, held five group leader training classes one after another, training all group leaders in the plant in batches, while ensuring that production was not affected. During the training, the Party Committee Secretary and the Plant Director respectively gave reports on "The Importance of Group Work" and "How to Be a Good Group Leader", and organized the study of the experience of advanced groups such as He Xiaozhang. Through short-term training, their ideological awareness has been improved to varying degrees compared with the past, and they have clarified that the reason why group work was not done well in the past was mainly due to the lack of in-depth and thorough political and ideological work. At the same time, they also learned many methods and experiences in doing a good job in group work, and established the confidence to do a good job in group work, and expressed that they must bring what they have learned this time to actual work, and aspire to become advanced groups. Group leader Li Chang, through study, reversed the past work method of only managing production and not managing people, and changed from "one person carrying a thousand pounds" to "everyone carrying a thousand pounds."

On the basis of grasping group work, the Iron Smelting Plant Party Committee immediately launched an activity throughout the plant from the Party Committee to the branch, from the workshop to the office, universally linking with groups and focusing on cultivating groups. Leading cadres at all levels respectively selected two typical groups, advanced and backward, went deep down, dissected sparrows, summarized experience, promoted the general, and through concrete help, quickly improved the work ability of group leaders and further strengthened group work. The Deputy Secretary of the Party General Branch of the Third Workshop, after going deep into Zhao Xiang's group in this workshop, found that the core leadership of this group had not been formed, the labor organization was not reasonable enough, the attendance rate was low, and the tasks were often not completed. Therefore, he specifically helped the group leader unite a group of activists and form a core. As a result, this group quickly changed from a backward group to an advanced group.

After earnestly grasping group work, the Iron Smelting Plant Party Committee deeply realized that group work is an all-encompassing and extremely complex work, and it must be done well only after a long period of continuous efforts.

    把领导的根子扎到小组去
    昆钢炼铁厂从力量配备工作方法业务能力等方面提高小组领导水平
    本报讯　据云南日报消息：昆明钢铁公司炼铁厂党委认真抓小组，充分发挥小组在生产中的作用，有力地推动了生产的持续跃进。
    炼铁厂党委在开始抓小组工作的时候，便组织了专门力量，深入到各车间、班组作了一次普遍的调查了解。由此，他们就掌握了全厂所有生产小组的全貌。通过反复认真地摸底排队，大体上可以划为三种类型。第一类，领导核心基本形成的；第二类，领导核心不够坚强，缺乏管理制度，虽然在思想上、生产上出现了一些新气象，但尚不够巩固；第三类，领导核心没有形成，思想上、生产上仍处在落后状态。针对小组的具体情况，炼铁厂党委在摸底排队的基础上，对小组的领导力量做了适当的调整；新的小组长多是党员、共青团员和联系群众的积极分子。他们思想先进，关心集体，为群众所拥护。与此同时，还组成了以积极分子为骨干的小组领导核心。
    通过摸底排队，他们也发现尽管绝大多数小组长干劲很足，与群众也有密切的联系；但是，由于缺乏领导小组的经验，加上工作方法比较简易粗糙，因此，党的决议不能很快贯彻到群众中去，群众的愿望也不能及时反映上来。针对这一实际情况，炼铁厂党委在调整和加强小组领导力量，健全组织之后，为了普遍提高小组长的思想水平和领导能力，帮助他们正确认识小组工作的重要性，在保证生产不受到影响的情况下，先后举办了五次小组长训练班，将全厂所有小组长分批训练了一遍。在训练中，由厂党委书记、厂长分别作了“小组工作的重要性”和“如何当好小组长”的报告，组织学习了何小章等先进小组的经验。通过短期训练，他们的思想觉悟较前有了不同程度的提高，明确了过去小组工作搞不好主要是由于政治思想工作不深不透，同时，也学会了不少搞好小组工作的方法和经验，树立了搞好小组工作的信心，纷纷表示一定要把这次所学到的东西带到实际工作中去，立志成为先进小组。小组长李昌，通过学习，扭转了过去只管生产不管人的工作方法，变过去“千斤担子一人挑”为“千斤担子众人挑”。
    炼铁厂党委在抓小组工作的基础上，紧接着在全厂又开展了一个从党委到支部，从车间到科室，普遍与小组挂钩重点培养小组的活动。各级领导干部都分别选择了先进与落后两种典型的小组，深入下去，解剖麻雀，总结经验，推动一般，通过具体帮助，迅速提高了小组长的工作能力，进一步加强了小组工作。三车间党总支副书记，深入到这个车间的赵祥小组后，发现这个小组的核心领导没有形成，劳动组织不够合理，出勤率也低，经常完不成任务。于是，他就具体帮助小组长团结了一批积极分子，形成了核心。结果，这个小组迅速由落后小组变为先进小组。
    经过认真抓小组以后，炼铁厂党委深刻体会到小组工作是一项包罗万象、异常复杂的工作，必须经过较长时期不断努力，才能做好。
