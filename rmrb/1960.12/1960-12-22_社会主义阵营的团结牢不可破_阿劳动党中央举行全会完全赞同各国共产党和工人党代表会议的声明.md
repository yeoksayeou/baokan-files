Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, December 21st: This newspaper published today the communique of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party.

The communique said that the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party held a plenary session from December 19th to 20th, presided over by First Secretary Enver Hoxha.

The meeting heard, discussed and unanimously adopted the report made by the delegation of the Albanian Labor Party, represented by Hoxha, who attended the meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties of all countries held in Moscow in November 1960, approved all the activities of the Albanian Labor Party delegation during the meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties of all countries, and passed the corresponding resolutions.

The plenary session fully endorsed the Moscow meeting's statement and appeal to the people of the world.

The meeting decided that the Fourth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party will be held on February 13, 1961.

The resolution adopted at the meeting pointed out that the statement of the eighty-one communist and workers' parties is a program document of the international communist movement. Based on the immortal doctrine of Marxism-Leninism and the collective experience of all communist and workers' parties, it defines the principled position on the most important issues of the current situation and their further struggle for peace, national independence, democracy and socialism. This statement fully embodies the correct Marxist-Leninist line consistently followed by the Albanian Labor Party on issues such as foreign policy, peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems, ensuring and maintaining peace, socialist construction, and defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism and consolidating the unity of the socialist camp and the international communist movement .

The resolution stated that the meeting of representatives of eighty-one communist and workers' parties once again proved that it is beneficial and necessary for representatives of communist parties of all countries to hold meetings, jointly discuss issues through consultation to reach consensus, and coordinate joint actions in the struggle for common goals.

The resolution stated that the Albanian Labor Party will take the Moscow meeting’s statement as the cornerstone of all its work, and will strictly implement this statement as it strictly implemented the 1957 Moscow Declaration.

The resolution stated that the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party emphasized that the statement's evaluation of the role of the Soviet Union in the socialist camp and the Soviet Communist Party as the most experienced and time-tested party in the international communist movement expresses objective reality and the sentiments of Albanian communists. Our party has always regarded the Soviet Communist Party as the recognized vanguard of the international communist movement. Our people regard the Soviet Union as their precious friend, just as the Albanian people will always be loyal friends of the Soviet people. In the most difficult years of struggle for liberation and socialist construction, this friendship, built on the basis of Marxist-Leninist doctrine, has been strengthened in the hearts of the Albanian people. Our party, with the Central Committee headed by Comrade Hoxha, forged this friendship. No force in the world can destroy Soviet-Albanian friendship.

The resolution emphasized that the communist and workers' parties of all countries protect their unity as they protect their most precious possessions, and continuously strengthen this unity on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and the principles of proletarian internationalism. The unity of the communist and workers' parties of socialist countries and the unity of the socialist camp are the foundation of the unity of the international communist movement. The unity between the two largest parties—the Soviet Communist Party and the Chinese Communist Party—and the unity between the two largest countries in the socialist camp—the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China—are of particular significance to the unity of the international communist movement and the unity of the socialist camp. The plenary session believes that the statement of the eighty-one Parties is a basic document for further strengthening the unity of the communist and workers' parties of all countries and the unity of the socialist camp. The Albanian Labor Party will continue to do its best to make our unity unbreakable.

The resolution said that imperialism is trying to split the socialist camp and the international communist movement, but the hopes of the imperialists headed by the United States are doomed to bankruptcy. The Moscow meeting in November 1960 gave their plans a powerful and devastating blow. The statement is an important weapon for communists all over the world in the struggle against imperialism and in defense of peace.

The resolution stated that the meeting of representatives of the eighty-one parties also condemned the concentrated expression of the international opportunist Yugoslav variant—the "theory" of modern revisionists. The statement pointed out the true face of the Yugoslav revisionists as traitors to Marxism-Leninism who carry out sabotage activities against the socialist camp and the international communist movement. The plenary session of the Central Committee believes that the conclusion in the statement that it is necessary to further expose the leaders of the Yugoslav revisionists is of great significance and regards it as an important task for every Marxist-Leninist party in the future.

The resolution said that the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party instructed all party organizations to seriously study the historic documents of the meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties of all countries—the statement and the appeal to the people of the world, to widely publicize them among the masses during the preparations for the Fourth Congress of the Party, and to use these documents as the basis for all their work.

    社会主义阵营的团结牢不可破
    阿劳动党中央举行全会完全赞同各国共产党和工人党代表会议的声明
    新华社地拉那21日电　此间报纸今天公布了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会全体会议的公报。
    公报说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会在第一书记恩·霍查主持下，于12月19日到20日举行了全体会议。
    会议听取、讨论并一致通过了霍查代表参加1960年11月在莫斯科举行的各国共产党和工人党代表会议的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党代表团所作的报告，对阿尔巴尼亚劳动党代表团在各国共产党和工人党代表会议期间的全部活动表示赞同，并通过了相应的决议。
    全会完全赞同莫斯科会议的声明和告世界人民书。
    会议决定，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第四次代表大会于1961年2月13日举行。
    会议通过的决议指出，八十一个共产党和工人党的声明是国际共产主义运动的纲领性文件，它在马克思列宁主义的不朽学说和所有共产党和工人党的集体经验的基础上，确定了对当前最重要的问题以及它们进一步为争取和平、民族独立、民主和社会主义而斗争的原则立场。在这个声明中充分地体现了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党所一贯遵循的在对外政策、不同制度国家间和平共处、保障和维护和平、社会主义建设以及保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性和巩固社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结等问题上的正确的马克思列宁主义的路线。
    决议说，八十一个共产党和工人党代表会议再一次证明，各国共产党代表之间举行会晤，通过协商途径来共同商讨问题以取得一致的观点，协调在争取共同目标的斗争中的共同行动，是有利的和必须的。
    决议说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党将把莫斯科会议声明作为整个工作的基石，并像严格地执行1957年的莫斯科会议宣言一样，严格执行这一声明。
    决议说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会全体会议强调指出，声明对苏联在社会主义阵营中的作用和苏联共产党是国际共产主义运动最有经验和久经考验的党的评价，表达了客观现实和阿尔巴尼亚共产党人的情感。我们党始终把苏联共产党看作是国际共产主义运动的公认的先锋队。我国人民把苏联看作是他们的珍贵朋友，正如阿尔巴尼亚人民永远是苏联人民的忠实朋友一样。在争取解放和建设社会主义的最艰难的斗争岁月里，这个建立在马克思列宁主义学说基础上的友谊，在阿尔巴尼亚人的心里得到了加强，我们的党，它以霍查同志为首的中央委员会锤炼了这个友谊。世界上没有任何力量能够破坏苏阿友谊。
    决议强调说，各国共产党和工人党像保护最珍贵的东西一样地保护着他们的团结，并在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上日益加强这个团结。社会主义各国共产党和工人党的团结、社会主义阵营的团结是国际共产主义运动的团结的基础。两个最大的党——苏联共产党和中国共产党之间的团结，社会主义阵营最大的两个国家——苏联和中华人民共和国之间的团结对国际共产主义运动的团结和社会主义阵营的团结具有特别的意义。全会认为，八十一个党的声明是进一步加强各国共产党和工人党以及社会主义阵营的团结的基本文件。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党在今后仍将竭尽全力使我们的团结牢不可破。
    决议说，帝国主义力图使社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动分裂，但是，以美国为首的帝国主义者的希望是注定要破产的。1960年11月的莫斯科会议对它们的计划，给予了有力的毁灭性的打击。声明是全世界共产党人在反对帝国主义和保卫和平的斗争中的重要武器。
    决议说，八十一个党的代表会议也谴责了国际机会主义的南斯拉夫变种——现代修正主义者的“理论”的集中表现。声明指出了南斯拉夫修正主义者作为马克思列宁主义的叛徒，对社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动进行破坏活动的真面目。党中央全会认为，声明中关于必须进一步揭露南斯拉夫修正主义者的领导人的这一结论具有非常重要的意义，并把它看作是每个马克思列宁主义政党今后的一项重要任务。
    决议说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央全会指示所有的党组织，要十分认真地学习各国共产党和工人党代表会议的历史性文件——声明和告世界人民书，在党的第四次代表大会筹备期间，在群众中广泛进行宣传，并以这些文件作为自己全部工作的依据。
