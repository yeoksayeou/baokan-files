    On Zhuangzi's Relativism
    Lenin said: “For objective dialectics, there is the absolute in the relative. For subjectivism and sophistry, the relative is only the relative, excluding the absolute.” We know that Zhuangzi's philosophy is relativism, that is to say, in his philosophy, it is precisely: "The relative is only the relative, excluding the absolute."
    Zhuangzi’s "having dependence" is the relative, and "having no dependence" is the absolute. In his philosophy, the relationship between "having dependence" and "having no dependence" is separated. Within the scope of "having dependence," the absolute is excluded. He believes that the differences, such as size, lifespan, self and other ... "are only relative, excluding the absolute." He denies that there is an absolute, essential difference in size, lifespan, and self and other in the relative sense, and thus concludes: "There is nothing greater than the tip of an autumn hair, and Mount Tai is small. There is no one who lives longer than a stillborn child, and Peng Zu died young," "Regarding death and life as one, regarding acceptable and unacceptable as consistent" ... This is Zhuangzi's relativism. Relativism is the inevitable result of the view that the relative excludes the absolute.
    On the other hand, Zhuangzi admits the "absolute." However, since he excludes the absolute in the relative, the absolute he admits is an independent absolute, which is his "having no dependence" "Dao." This "Dao" is "what everything relies on for transformation," that is, everything that changes depends on it, but it itself is "having no dependence," depending on nothing.
    To separate the absolute and the relative in cosmology, believing that the absolute exists outside of the relative, logically there are two possibilities: (1) to believe that this absolute is a certain substance occupying time and space, such as atoms or electrons. This is metaphysical materialism; (2) to believe that this absolute is the non-material - spirit - that creates things. This is idealism. Laozi reached idealism by finding the absolute "Dao" outside of all relative things, and so did Zhuangzi. But in Zhuangzi's book, this logic is even more obvious.
    Zhuangzi admits that things are constantly changing (but he denies the relative stillness of things), but he wants to find a master and initiator of change, that is, to find something that initiates change outside of all relative changing things and their processes, while itself being absolutely unchanging. Who exactly initiated it? He replied that it is the True Master, namely "Dao." The change of things is "dependent" on this initiator's "Dao," rather than "self-movement" (see "On Levelling All Things"). So who initiated the "Dao" that serves as the initiator? If it is admitted that there is something that initiates "Dao", then who initiated that thing? ... To keep asking like this, that would be "as if there is an initiator, as if there is an initiator, endlessly." But Zhuangzi said: "Dao" is the "having no dependence" absolute. It is the ultimate master, the ultimate initiator, it is an eternal, absolutely unchanging thing. Denying the "self-movement" of things, the source of "self-movement," and looking for an initiator, this initiator must be absolutely unchanging.
    Metaphysical materialism, for example, believes that the "atom" is absolute, but the atom is still an individual thing, that is, the "absolute" it admits is not actually beyond all individuals, but is itself a certain individual (or "origin," "atom," "qi," etc.). However, believing that there is an independently existing "absolute" outside of all individuals, it must be spirit. It is obvious that finding the absolute outside of all relatives and finding the general outside of all individuals is a logical path to falling into idealism.
    The above-mentioned logical path of Zhuangzi's thinking is related to his denial of the relative stillness and relativity of movement. He believes that there is no relative stillness within the scope of "having dependence," "just being born and just dying, just dying and just being born, just possible and just impossible, just impossible and just possible," and everything has no qualitative determinacy. Denying the qualitative determinacy of things is the basic characteristic of relativism. But on the other hand, he also denies the absoluteness of movement, believing that there is an absolutely unchanging thing (namely the "having no dependence" "Dao"); moreover, since he excludes the source and absoluteness of movement from various movement processes, he can only take the absolutely unchanging "Dao" as the "basis" for why movement processes move. From this, it can be seen that splitting the relative and the absolute in the problem of movement, reaching relativism at one extreme, will reach the denial of the absoluteness of movement at the other extreme.
    To sum up the above, it comes down to one point: separating the relative and the absolute, finding the absolute outside of all relatives, finding the general (commonality) outside of all individuals (individuality), and finding the absoluteness or source of movement outside of all movement processes, is the epistemological root of idealism. As a lesson of theoretical thinking, it has practical significance.

    Lenin said: "Only a sophist would obliterate the difference between imperialist wars and national wars on the grounds that one kind of war can be transformed into another. Dialectics has more than once served - as has been the case in the history of Greek philosophy - as a bridge to sophistry. But we are always dialecticians, and in our struggle against sophistry, we do not fundamentally deny any possibility of transformation, but rather conduct a concrete analysis of a thing and its environment and development." Zhuangzi also obliterates the difference between "self and other" on the grounds that "this" can be transformed into "that". Laozi's dialectics also happened to serve as a bridge to sophistry - relativism - in the history of pre-Qin philosophy.
    Laozi's philosophy has a rather rich content of naive dialectics, but his dialectics has a fundamental flaw, that is, he regards the struggle of opposites as relative and exaggerates unity as absolute and unconditional, thereby leading to circular reasoning (that is, metaphysics), leading to the conclusion of passive inaction that resolves contradictions and denies subjective initiative. Regarding the transformation of opposites as absolute and unconditional contains the seeds of relativism. Zhuangzi started from here, developing the seeds and turning them into relativism.
    Regarding the mutual transformation of opposites as absolute and unconditional: 1. Logically contains the seeds of relativism. For example, the transformation of misfortune and fortune is absolute, and their difference is relative, then it is not difficult to derive: there is no principled essential difference between misfortune and fortune, denying the relative stillness of things, the qualitative determinacy of things; thus, misfortune and fortune are only temporary superficial phenomena, thus going to relativism and nihilism; 2. Logically excludes subjective initiative. Since the mutual transformation of misfortune and fortune is unconditional, then in this transformation, people cannot exert any subjective initiative.
    Laozi's dialectics regards the transformation of positive and negative as absolute and unconditional; and Zhuangzi is moving "forward" from here, denying the relative stillness of things and their qualitative determinacy, the qualitative difference of things, and regarding self and other, object and self, life and death, lifespan and premature death, right and wrong, misfortune and fortune, etc., as the same and equivalent. In this way, relativism is reached. He is bound to deny human subjective initiative more thoroughly than Laozi, writing off the difference between man and nature in one stroke.
    Synthesizing the above discussion, we can summarize it as the following point: Admitting that the struggle of opposites is absolute and unconditional, and that unity is relative and conditional, logically inevitably admits human subjective initiative, and logically blocks the path to transformation to relativism; conversely, if it is admitted that the struggle of opposites is relative and conditional, and that unity is absolute and unconditional, then logically excludes human subjective initiative, and contains the opportunity to transform to relativism. From this, it can be seen that: to adhere to thorough materialist dialectics and avoid relativism, it is necessary to adhere to the principle that the struggle of opposites is absolute and unconditional, and that unity is relative and conditional.

### 关于庄子的相对主义

专栏：学术论文摘要

    关于庄子的相对主义
    列宁说：“对于客观的辩证法说来，相对之中有着绝对。对于主观主义和诡辩说来，相对只是相对的，是排斥绝对的。”我们知道，庄子哲学是相对主义，就是说，在他那里正是：“相对只是相对的，是排斥绝对的”。
    庄子的“有待”即是相对，“无待”即是绝对。在他那里，“有待”和“无待”的关系是分割的。在“有待”的范围内是排斥绝对的，他认为，例如大小、寿夭、彼此……的差别“只是相对的，是排斥绝对的”，他否认相对而言的大小、寿夭、彼此之中有绝对，有本质的差别，于是得出结论：“天下莫大于秋毫之末，而泰山为小，莫寿乎殇子，而彭祖为夭”，“以死生为一条，可不可为一贯”……这就是庄子的相对主义。相对主义，是相对排斥绝对这种观点的必然结果。
    另一面，庄子却承认“绝对”。但是，他既然排斥了相对之中有着绝对，他承认的绝对就是独立自存的绝对了，这就是他的“无待”的“道”。这个“道”是“一化之所待”，即一切变化所依赖的东西，而它自己却是“无待”，无所依赖的。
    在宇宙论上把绝对和相对割裂开来，认为在相对的东西之外存在着绝对，从逻辑上看有两种可能：（一）认为这个绝对是占有时空的某种物质，例如原子、电子，这是形而上学的唯物主义；（二）认为这个绝对是创造物的非物——精神，这是唯心主义。老子是从在所有的相对的东西之外找到了绝对的“道”，而达到唯心主义的，庄子也是如此。但在庄子书里，这条逻辑则是更加明显的。
    庄子承认事物是变化无常的（但他否认事物的相对静止），但他要找一个变化的主使者、发动者，也就是从所有相对的变化着的事物及其过程之外找一个发动变化的、而本身绝对不变的东西。究竟是谁发动的呢？他回答说，是真宰，即“道”。事物的变化即“有待”于这个发动者的“道”，而不是“自己运动”（见《齐物论》）。那么作为发动者的“道”，又是谁发动它的呢？如果承认有一个发动“道”的东西，那么那个东西又是谁发动的呢？……如此追问下去，那就是“犹其有发动者，犹其有发动者，无已”了。而庄子却是这样说的：“道”是“无待”的绝对，它是最后的主宰者，最后的发动者，它是永恒的绝对不变化的东西。否认事物的“自己运动”，“自己运动”的源泉，而要找出一个发动者来，这个发动者必须是绝对的不变的。
    形而上学的唯物主义，例如认为“原子”是绝对，但原子仍是个别的物，即它所承认的“绝对”实际上并不是超乎所有个别的，而是它自己即是某种个别（或“原”、“原子”、“气”等等）。但是，认为在所有个别之外有一个独立存在的“绝对”，它却必然是精神。很显然在所有相对之外找绝对、在所有个别之外找一般，这是陷入唯心主义的一条逻辑路径。
    上述庄子的思维的逻辑路径，是同他否认相对静止和运动的相对性相联系的。他认为“有待”的范围内是没有相对静止的，“方生方死，方死方生，方可方不可，方不可方可”，一切都没有质的规定性可言。否认事物的质的规定性，这是相对主义的基本特征。但是，另一方面，他又否认运动的绝对性，认为有绝对不变的一种东西（即“无待”的“道”）；而且，既然他把运动的源泉、绝对性从各个运动过程中排斥出来，那么，他也就只能以绝对不变之“道”作为运动过程之所以运动的“根据”了。由此可见，在运动问题上割裂相对和绝对，在一个极端上会达到相对主义，在另一个极端上又会达到否认运动的绝对性。
    以上所说，归结到一点就是：割裂相对和绝对，从所有相对之外找绝对、从所有个别（个性）之外找一般（共性）、从所有运动过程之外找运动的绝对性或运动的源泉，是唯心主义的认识论根源。作为理论思维的教训，是有现实意义的。

    列宁说过：“只有诡辩家才会根据一种战争可以转化为他种战争的理由，来抹杀帝国主义战争和民族战争之间的差别。辩证法曾不止一次地作过——在希腊哲学史上就有过这种情形——通向诡辩法的桥梁。但是，我们始终是辩证论者，我们同诡辩论作斗争时，所使用的手段不是根本否认任何转化的可能性，而是对某一事物及其环境和发展进行具体的分析。”庄子也是以“此”可以转为“彼”为理由，来抹杀“彼此”之间的差别的。老子的辩证法，在先秦哲学史上也恰好作了通向诡辩法——相对主义的桥梁。
    老子哲学具有内容相当丰富的朴素辩证法，但他的辩证法却有根本缺陷，即把对立面的斗争看成相对的，把统一夸大为绝对的、无条件的，从而引出了循环论（亦即形而上学），引出了消解矛盾、否认主观能动性的消极无为的结论。把对立面的转化看成是绝对的、无条件的，这里就包含了相对主义的萌芽。庄子正是从这里出发，把萌芽发展起来，变成了相对主义。
    把对立面的相互转化看成绝对的无条件的，就：一、逻辑地包含着相对主义的萌芽。例如祸和福的转化是绝对的，它们的差别则是相对的，那么也就不难引出：祸和福没有原则的本质上的差别，否认事物的相对静止、事物的质的规定性；于是祸福云云不过是暂时的表面的现象罢了，这样就走到了相对主义和虚无主义；二、逻辑地排斥主观能动性。既然祸福相互转化是无条件的，那末，在这个转化当中，人们就是不可能发挥什么主观能动作用的。
    老子的辩证法把正反转化看成绝对的无条件的；而庄子正是从这里向“前”走，否认事物的相对静止及其质的规定性、事物的质的区别，把彼此、物我、生死、寿夭、是非、祸福等等，看作是一样的等同的。这样，就走到了相对主义。他就必然比老子更彻底地否认人的主观能动性，把人和自然界的区别一笔勾销。
    综合以上的论述，我们可以归结为下面一点：承认对立面的斗争是绝对的、无条件的，统一是相对的、有条件的，也就逻辑地必然承认人的主观能动性，也就从逻辑上堵塞了向相对主义转化的通路；相反的，如果承认对立面的斗争是相对的、有条件的，而统一是绝对的、无条件的，也就逻辑地排斥人的主观能动性，并包含着向相对主义转化的契机。由此可见：坚持彻底的唯物辩证法，避免相对主义，必须坚持对立面的斗争是绝对的无条件的、统一是相对的有条件的原理。
