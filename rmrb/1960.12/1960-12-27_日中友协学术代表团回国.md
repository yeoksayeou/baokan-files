Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 26th: The academic delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association, which came to China at the invitation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, left Guangzhou today to return home.

	Fukushima Yoichi, the head of the delegation, spoke to Guangzhou reporters on the eve of his departure from Guangzhou about his impressions of his visit to China. In his remarks, Fukushima Yoichi expressed satisfaction that the delegation's desire to further develop academic exchanges between Japan and China had been fulfilled during their stay in China.

	Fukushima Yoichi said that he was deeply moved to see the scene of China's Great Leap Forward during his visit to China. He believes that the reason for China's Great Leap Forward achieving such great success is due to its close reliance on the broad masses of the people.
