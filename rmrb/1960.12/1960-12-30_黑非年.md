    Black African Year
    Chen Hansheng
   (In commemoration of the independence of sixteen African nations in 1960)
    Africa, cradle of humanity, holds a total population of slightly under two hundred million. Their skin is dark, their hair curly, limbs stout, and jaws protruding. Western European colonialists, under the guise of spreading Christianity, invaded. People were slaughtered and land seized, with natural and man-made disasters descending together. They spared no effort in plundering resources: pepper, ivory, and gold. They trafficked living people as black slaves, cruelly capturing them amidst mournful cries. Alas, toiling all day without enough to eat, poverty and illness combined to send them to the grave. Pitifully, the population did not flourish; growth has been minimal for three hundred years. Colonialism is heartless, sucking the marrow and recklessly slaughtering.
    The call for independence began in Accra, inspiring all the people of Black Africa. Lay down arms to safeguard peace, and establish a democratic political system with dignity. Revitalize production to promote construction, and rely on our own strength to resist foreign aggression. You ask what is key? A nation's sovereignty must be obtained first. If colonialism is not eradicated, comprador puppets will act without restraint. As long as colonialism exists, freedom and happiness will dissipate like smoke.
    Vast and boundless are the sixteen nations, from the Tropic of Cancer to the Tropic of Capricorn; an island, a corner, a coastline, each nation distinctly known as Black Africa. Trampled under iron heels successively, dependencies of Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium; now, together in this year, declaring independence, national flags flying, truly joyous. Refusing to be oppressed again, relying on the power of our sovereign rights. The year 1960, the Black African Year, will forever be engraved in world history.

    黑非年
    陈翰笙
   （纪念一九六○年非洲十六国之独立）
    人类摇篮黑非洲，元元总数二亿弱。肤色深浓头发卷，四肢粗短高突颚。西欧殖民主义者，借传基督来相侵。人遭屠杀地被夺，天灾人祸同降临。搜括物资无遗力，胡椒象牙与黄金。远贩生人充黑奴，哀哀残酷被生擒。吁嗟乎，竟日劳动不一饱，贫病交加入黄泉。可怜人口不繁衍，三百年来增殖鲜。殖民主义无心肝，吸尽膏血侈诛殄。
    倡议独立阿克拉，黑非人民齐鼓舞。载戢干戈保和平，政治堂堂创民主。振兴生产谋建设，自力更生御外侮。君问何者是枢机？一国主权应先取。殖民主义不铲除，买办傀儡无忌惮。殖民主义一日存，自由幸福烟云散。
    莽莽苍苍十六国，北回归至南回归；一岛一角一海岸，诸邦历历称黑非。铁蹄先后践踏下，附属英法与意比；而今同岁告独立，国旗飞扬真可喜。拒不受人再欺压，发皇主权有所恃。一九六零黑非年，永将镂入世界史。
