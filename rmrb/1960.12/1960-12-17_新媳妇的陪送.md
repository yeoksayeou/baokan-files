The fresh, tender kohlrabi leaves shimmer in the early winter sun, truly delightful. Secretary Wang, looking at the five mu of kohlrabi with satisfaction, said meaningfully, "This is the new bride's dowry!" I found this very novel. Because in our area, since ancient times, a new bride's dowry has always been things like chests, tables, quilts, clothes, washbasins... things like that. I'd never heard of dowries of vegetables. So, I curiously asked Secretary Wang about it, and this is what I learned.

This new bride is Chang Yue'e, the production team leader of the Fifth Team. She only married into this team this summer. It was said she was going to marry last year, but the brigade in her natal village wouldn't let her. When she came, her husband, Wang Yusheng, was the one who greeted her. Her entire dowry was a bamboo basket she carried and one jin of kohlrabi seeds.

"At that time, our team couldn't buy kohlrabi seeds anywhere, so we were overjoyed to see the seeds she brought," Secretary Wang said with a smile. "With this one jin of seeds, we can not only ensure that our canteen has vegetables to eat this winter and spring, but also supply the city in the future!"

The cadres in her natal team called her a "tractor," and that's really no exaggeration. She could do the work of one and a half people, and even strong young men couldn't keep up with her. She was skilled at needlework and even more adept at fieldwork, not only good at plowing and hoeing, but also excellent at operating the seed drill. When she first came, it was during the wheat harvest. Young men competed with her and were exhausted and sweating, but they still couldn't beat her. Her work skills were so great that mischievous young men stuck out their tongues in amazement, and the elderly also gave her a thumbs-up in praise.

During the autumn harvest battle, this team lacked draught animals. To deliver the public grain as soon as possible, they used both animals and human labor to pull carts. One cart could carry over a thousand jin, and the distance to the warehouse was eight li. She and another woman worked together and could pull four trips a day. Stories like this could go on for three days.

In the first month after she came to this team, she earned 4.5 yuan in wages. She didn't spend it. Instead, she bought seven chi of black cloth for her mother-in-law and made a cloth shirt, with tight and dense stitches. After finishing it, she gave it to her mother-in-law and said, "Mother, I made a cloth shirt for you. I wonder if it fits?" She tried it on, and it was just right. Her mother-in-law was so happy that she couldn't close her mouth, and she told everyone, "My daughter-in-law's hands are worth more than gold; they are better than any dowry!"

Didn't she also have a bamboo basket as part of her dowry? Her basket is very useful. From the day she married in, she carried it with her everywhere. When she went to the fields, the basket was empty; when she came back, it was full. She either picked up wheat ears, sweet potato heads, or bean grains on the road, or she gathered broken firewood, which she would then give to the canteen. The team calculated that in this autumn season alone, she had picked up more than forty jin of beans, more than five hundred jin of sweet potatoes, more than six hundred jin of sweet potato leaves, and more than nine hundred jin of sweet potato vines and firewood. She picked up whatever she saw, and her basket was truly a "treasure basket!"

Later, the women in our team all learned from her. These baskets, who knows how much income they added to the team.

"Ah! Look, their team is coming back. The one leading them is her," Secretary Wang said.

I looked in the direction Secretary Wang was pointing. A group of women, all carrying rake-hoes and baskets full of firewood, were walking towards the village, talking and laughing. From a distance, I couldn't see her appearance clearly, but from her tall figure and vigorous steps, I could tell that she was a very capable rural woman!

Secretary Wang sighed again and said, "Seeing her, I think of this kohlrabi. She's so young, how did she think so far ahead? This is truly a new person doing new things!" After pausing, he said, "We're preparing for a bumper kohlrabi harvest. The canteen will definitely make a few dishes to supplement the wedding feast. You must come and drink the wedding wine then!"

### 新媳妇的陪送

    新媳妇的陪送
    程明
    鲜嫩鲜嫩的苤兰叶子，在初冬的阳光下闪耀着，真正喜人。王书记很欣慰地看着这五亩见方的苤兰，意味深长地说：“这是新媳妇的陪送呀！”我感到很新奇。因为俺们这儿，自古以来，凡是新媳妇的陪送，都是箱子、桌子、被子、衣服、脸盆……之类的东西，从来没听说过陪送菜的。于是，我好奇地问起王书记，原来是这么回事。
    这新媳妇，是五队的生产队长常月娥。她是今年夏天才嫁到这队来的。去年就说要过门的，只是她娘家的大队里不放。她来时，他们的大队书记还恋恋不舍地说：“俺们的‘拖拉机’被你们拉跑了。”
    她往这村嫁时，是她丈夫王玉生接着来的。她的全部陪送，是她随身挎的一个竹篮和一斤苤兰种籽。
    “那时，俺队到处打听也买不着苤兰种籽，看到她带来的种籽，俺们喜欢的没法说了。”王书记边说边笑：“有这么一斤种籽，不仅能保证俺们食堂今冬明春有菜吃，将来还能供应城市呢！”
    她娘家队里的干部说她是“拖拉机”，那真是一点不假，干活真是一个抵个半，强壮的小伙子也不在她手上。她针线活巧，地里活更拿手，不仅犁地锄地在行，就连摇耧播种也呱呱叫。她初来时，正赶上割麦，小伙子跟她较量过，累得汗流浃背，还没有赢她。她的干活本领大，调皮的小伙子见了直伸舌头，老人们也都直伸大拇指称赞。
    在三秋战斗中，这队畜力差，为了早日送完公粮，他们除了用牲口拉，还用人拉。一架车能拉一千多斤，这里离仓库八里路，她和另一个妇女合伙，一天能拉四趟。像这样的事，说三天也说不完。
    她来这队头一个月，得工资四元五角，她没舍得花，给她婆婆扯了七尺黑布，做了一件布衫，针脚缝得密密的，做好后，她拿给婆婆说：“娘，给你做个布衫，不知可合身？”穿上试试，不大不小，不肥不瘦正合身。她婆婆喜欢得嘴也合不住了，见人就说：“俺那媳妇的手啊，是个金不换，比什么陪送都好！”
    她的陪送不是还有一个竹篮子吗？她的篮子用处可大了。自过门那天起，她就不离身地挎着。上地，是个空篮；回来，满满一篮。不是在路上拾麦头、红芋头、豆粒，就是拾碎柴草，回来就交给食堂。队里给她统计一下，光这一秋季，她就拾豆子四十多斤，红芋五百多斤，红芋叶六百多斤，红芋秧、柴草九百多斤。她见啥拾啥，她的篮子真是个“聚宝篮”呀！
    以后，俺队的妇女都学她。这些篮子呀，不知给队里增加了多少收入。
    “啊！你看，她们队回来了，领头的那个就是她。”王书记说。
    我顺着王书记手指的方向看去，一群妇女，都扛着钉把，挎着装满柴草的篮子，边说边笑往村里走来。离得很远，我看不清她的模样，但从她那高高的身材、矫健的步伐上，可以断定，她是个多么能干的农村妇女！
    王书记又感叹地说：“看见她，我就想起这苤兰了。她年轻轻的，怎么想得这样远呢？这真是新人做新事呀！”停了停，他又说：“俺们准备苤兰丰收了，食堂一定做几样菜，补补喜酒。到那时，你可要来喝喜酒呀！”
