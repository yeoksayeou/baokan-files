"Soup Drop"
    Yang Su

    Gangpo Head, with its verdant pines and cypresses, forests of oaks and chestnuts, and red kapok trees sprouting jade-like buds. From the jungle, a few Jingpo youths emerge, among them Lela, the head of the joint defense team. On their white headscarves are sewn fiery red pompoms, and they wear glittering hero knots strung with yuan beads. Blowing their "Sangbi" (note), they are full of vigor and confidence. Bathed in sunlight, they sing mountain songs and nimbly head towards Mangang.

      "Bang... crack," suddenly a burst of crisp gunfire rings out. The people of the border village, highly vigilant, immediately begin to discuss. Some say:
    "It's the joint defense team doing target practice!" Others say, "It's 'Soup Drop'!"

    "Soup Drop" is a shooting skills competition for Jingpo youth, and also a most joyful and captivating game. Whoever shoots down the thin hemp string tied to a packet of beef at the tip of a bamboo pole becomes a hero in the eyes of the people. He will receive especially warm hospitality from the host and also receive affectionate glances from the girls. But "Soup Drop" also evokes many painful memories for the young joint defense team leader Lela...

    Lela will always remember: In the early spring when the wild cherry blossoms bloomed like rosy clouds, he shot down the target tied by Muna, the prettiest girl in Gongnian Village. On that hemp string, a small red butterfly was woven from fine grass. That night, the two of them leaned close at a bonfire in the forest, exchanging red threads and talking about the happiness of their married life. Unexpectedly, the next day, Muna was snatched away by the mountain official to be his wife. Muna was an ambitious girl. She escaped from the mountain official's house that night and has not been seen since. In those years, what could Lela do? He could only play his melancholy "Sangbi" day and night, wandering near the bonfire where he and Muna had sat...

    Now, Lela is both production team leader and joint defense team leader in the first people's commune of the Jingpo people. Every night, the young joint defense team members, after dinner, come one after another to the fireside in his home. The orange-red firelight dances, illuminating the swarthy, purplish-red faces of a dozen Jingpo youths. The gunstocks and scabbards clink. Bitter tea is simmering on the hearth, emitting a strong aroma. When everyone is there, Lela sits in the middle, holding a commemorative album with gold lettering on red cloth, and, with a happy smile on his face, says to everyone:

    "Comrades, our study begins. Today our lesson is 'Long Live the Three Red Banners'!" The joint defense team members huddle closer together, listening attentively as Lela gives a political lesson.

    He begins to tell the joint defense team members about the great changes in the motherland, talking about the towering iron smelting furnaces, the patterned cloth flowing like the Mangshi River in textile factories. He speaks of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao who formulated the Three Red Banners. Speaking of Chairman Mao, he can't help but open the commemorative album to the picture and pass it around for the people to see. The joint defense team members look at it again and again, asking questions as if they were seeing a long-lost relative, pressing it to their chests. They discuss, saying: "Chairman Mao, who lives in Beijing, can hear the beating of the hearts and pulses of the Jingpo people at any time, listening to the voices of the Jingpo people!" The joint defense team members beat elephant-foot drums and loud bronze gongs, joyfully singing:

    Why is the spotted flower especially fragrant?
    Because Chairman Mao lives in Daiwa's home!
    Why doesn't the sun set on the mountain?
    Because Chairman Mao's brilliance forever illuminates the frontier!

    After singing the song and drinking the first round of bitter tea, they begin to discuss the work of the team. Lela raises a new question to the members:

    "Comrades, today the branch secretary gave our joint defense team a new task, asking us to build a nursery. What do you all think?"

    Everyone is first stunned, then they begin to discuss in a confused manner. Someone shouts:

    "What? Asking us to kill weevils, hunt wild boars and leopards, we can do very well. But now, asking us to build a nursery. How can you ask us to use our rifles to deal with the shit cloths of women and little children!"

    Lela listens and looks at the members. Everyone nods, indicating agreement with what was just said, also hoping for Lela to answer the question. Lela adds firewood to the fire, letting it burn even more brightly and warmly, and then says to everyone:

    "Comrades, I already said these things to the branch secretary. Guess how the branch secretary answered?"

    "How did the branch secretary answer?"

    "He said, 'Do you think that building socialism only requires killing weevils, hunting wild boars, and catching leopards? You joint defense team members are all spirited young men of Chairman Mao's era. If you don't build it for the next generation, should we let the old folks do it?' Comrades, what do you say, to let the children of the Jingpo people grow like flowers, growing as beautiful as flowers, how can we oppose this task?"

    "Yes! Let the children of the Jingpo people grow like flowers, growing as beautiful as flowers, we cannot refuse this task!" Several people said in unison:

    "Right, we cannot refuse. Tomorrow we will build a house for the nursery."

    Lela stands up and says to the members:

    "What everyone says is right, we must make sure that these flowers cannot be blown away by the wind, or rotted by the rain, or struck down by lightning. Ah! The branch secretary said that there will also be a nursery worker who studied in Beijing!"

    "Who is she?"

    Lela smiles and says to the members:

    "She is a Jingpo girl!"

    "Oh, which family's girl is it!" Many people ask each other.

    From then on, every morning, Lela blows his silver whistle, and the joint defense team members take advantage of the morning gap to cut bamboo and grass, making time to rush to build the nursery, quickly completing it. In the verdant mountain village, the bamboo pillars, with their green faded, are as ivory-like, creamy yellow and smooth.

    After the house is built, women with children are eager to send their children in, but after Lela and the team committee discuss, they decide that in the past the Jingpo people had no choice but to get their children drunk with wine and leave them at home, but now they have a nursery, what a big thing this is! They should hold a meeting to celebrate, also take the opportunity to welcome the new nursery worker, and also play "Soup Drop".

    One night, Lela takes his rifle and long knife to guard the grain stack and hunt wild boars. The next morning, it is not until the sun is overhead that he sets out for home. As soon as he reaches the village entrance, he hears the loud and resounding sound of elephant-foot drums and bronze gongs, "Guang... Weng..." coming from the village, accompanied by the sound of gunshots, "Bang... Crack..." from time to time.

    He rushes into the village. From afar, he sees a cluster of green bamboo tips under the blue sky, with a "Soup Drop" wrapped in bamboo shoots hanging from it. A fine hemp string is also tied with a small red butterfly dyed with fine grass, swaying in the breeze. Lela sees it and his heart stirs. This kind of tying is so much like Muna! Which girl has learned this craft now! While he is thinking, he runs over, pushes through the crowd, and with one shot, hits the little red butterfly. The hemp string is broken, and the bamboo shoots fall to the ground. Everyone sees that it is Lela and shouts:

    "Look, Lela shot it down again."

    Just then, a girl with a red face is standing in front of him, a pair of bright, watery eyes gazing at him, wearing a Jingpo girl's costume, so much like Muna from more than a decade ago! Lela cannot suppress his excitement, runs forward and tightly grasps her hand, saying:

    "Welcome you to support us!"

    "No, I'm not here to support, I'm back to build our own home together with you!" After saying that, the girl giggles... Her laughter, like plucked strings, harmonizes with the enthusiastic drumbeats and gong sounds, filling this ancient, verdant mountain top with an atmosphere of happiness and pride.

Note: Sangbi: A bamboo musical instrument with a quiet sound like a flute.

    “汤跌”
    杨苏
    岗坡头，松柏苍翠，栎粟成林，红木树吐出了紫玉般的嫩芽。丛林中，闪出几个景颇族青年，其中有联防队长勒拉。在他们白色的包头上，缝着火一样红的绒球，插上用元珠串成的闪亮的英雄结，吹着“桑比”（注），充满朝气和自信。他们披着阳光，唱着山歌，轻捷地向蛮岗的方向奔去。
      “呯……叭，”突然传来一阵清脆的枪声。具有高度警惕的边寨的人们，立即议论开了。有的说：
    “这是联防队在打靶！”有的说：“这是汤跌！”
    “汤跌”，这是景颇族青年的一种射击技术竞赛，也是一种最愉快最迷人的游戏。只要谁打断竹梢上那根系着一包牛肉的细细的麻线，谁就在人们心目中成为英雄，他将受到主人特别殷勤的招待，也会收到姑娘们脉脉含情的眼光。可是“汤跌”也引起了年青的联防队长勒拉许多痛苦的回忆……
    勒拉永远记得：在那野樱桃花开得像朝霞一般美丽的初春，他一枪打下了供念村里最漂亮的姑娘木娜系上的靶子，那根麻线上用细草编成一只小红蝴蝶。当天晚上，他俩在山林里的篝火旁，偎倚着交换红线，交谈着婚后的幸福。不料，第二天，木娜就被山官抢去做妻子了。木娜是个有志气的姑娘，她当晚从山官家逃跑出去，至今也不知去向。在过去那些年头，勒拉有什么办法呢？他只能日日夜夜地吹着忧郁的“桑比”，徘徊在他和木娜坐过的篝火堆旁……
    如今，勒拉在景颇族第一个人民公社里担任了生产队长和联防队长。每天晚上，年青的联防队员们，吃了晚饭，就陆续来到他家的火塘边。桔红色的火光跳跃着，照亮了十来个景颇族青年黝黑紫红的面孔，枪托和刀鞘碰得乒乓响，火塘上煨着苦茶，散发着浓烈的香味。人来齐了，勒拉坐在正中间，手里拿着红布烫金的纪念册，嘴上露出幸福的微笑向大伙说：
    “伙伴们，我们的学习开始了，今天我们的功课是三面红旗万岁！”联防队员们互相靠得更紧一点，竖着耳朵开始听勒拉讲政治课。
    他开始向联防队员们讲述祖国的巨大变化，谈着高耸入云的炼铁高炉，纺织厂里像芒市河水一样流出的花布，又讲到制定三面红旗的共产党和毛主席，说到毛主席，他忍不住翻开纪念册上的像片，递给周围的人们看。联防队员们像看见久别的亲人似的，反复地看着问着，贴在自己的胸口，他们在议论说：“住在北京的毛主席，随时可以听到景颇人心脏和脉搏的跳动，倾听着景颇人的声音！”联防队员们敲起象脚鼓和响亮的铜铓，欢乐地唱起歌来了：
    斑色花为什么特别香？
    因为毛主席住在戴瓦家！
    山上为什么太阳不落？
    因为毛主席的光辉永远照亮着边疆！
    唱完了歌，喝了第一道苦茶，开始讨论队里的工作，勒拉向队员们提出了一个新的问题：
    “伙伴们，今天支部书记给我们联防队一个新任务，叫我们队上盖一个托儿所，大家意见怎么样？”
    大家先是一楞，接着就乱哄哄地议论起来。有人嚷着：
    “什么？叫我们杀蟊贼，打野猪、豹子，我们都可以干得很出色。呶，现在叫我们盖托儿所。怎么叫我们用火枪去和婆娘、小娃娃的屎布打交道啊！”
    勒拉听了，望了望队员们。大家都点点头，表示同意刚才的话，也希望勒拉回答这个问题。勒拉往火堆里添了柴，让火烧得更旺更温暖，然后才对大家说：
    “伙伴们，这些话我早就对支书说过了，你们猜支书怎么回答？”
    “支书怎么回答？”
    “他说，你以为建设社会主义只要杀蟊贼、猎野猪、捉豹子就够了吗？你们联防队个个都是毛主席时代的精精干干的小伙子，你们不来给下一代盖，难道让老爹老妈来盖？伙伴们，你们说，要让景颇家的孩子像花一样生长，长得像花一样好看，这任务怎么能反对呢？”
    “是啊！让景颇族小孩个个像花一样生长，长得像花一样好看，这个任务可不能拒绝呀！”好几个都不约而同地说：
    “对，不能拒绝，明天我们就给托儿所盖房子。”
    勒拉站起身来，对队员们说：
    “大伙说的对，我们要让这朵花风吹不散，雨淋不烂，雷打不掉。啊！支书说，还要来个到北京学习过的保育员呢！”
    “她是谁呢？”
    勒拉笑着对队员们说：
    “是个景颇族姑娘！”
    “哦，哪一家的姑娘呀！”好多人都互相询问。
    从此，每天清晨，勒拉吹起了银哨，联防队员就趁早上的空隙去砍竹子割草，抽空抢盖托儿所，很快完工了。在青翠的山村里，那褪了青的竹柱，就像象牙一样鹅黄光滑。
    房子盖好后，有小孩的妇女，都急着要把孩子送进去，可勒拉和队委会商量后决定，以前景颇人没办法，把小孩用酒灌醉丢在家里，现在却有了托儿所，这是多么大的事情啊！应该开一个会来庆祝，也趁这机会欢迎新来的保育员，同时还要玩玩“汤跌”。
    一天晚上，勒拉带着火枪长刀，去守谷垛打野猪去了。第二天上午，直到太阳当头的时候，他才动身回家，一到村子口，就听见村里响起了象脚鼓和铜锛响亮雄浑的“咣……嗡……”声，不时伴着“呯……叭……”的枪响。
    他急急跑进村子里，远远就见蓝天下一丛翠绿的竹梢头，挂了一个笋叶包着的“汤跌”，细细的麻线上还系着一个细草染成的小红蝴蝶，随着微风摇荡，勒拉看了，心里一动，这种系法多像木娜啊！现在哪个姑娘也学会了这个手艺啊！他一边想，一边飞跑过去，挤开人群，一枪，正打在小红蝴蝶上，麻线被打断了，笋叶掉在地上，大家一看是勒拉，就大喊：
    “看，还是勒拉打下来了。”
    正在这时，他前面站着一个脸孔红红的姑娘，一对亮汪汪的眼睛注视着他，穿着一身景颇族姑娘的服装，多么像十几年前的木娜啊！勒拉抑制不住兴奋，跑上前去紧紧握着她的手说：
    “欢迎你来支援我们！”
    “不，我不是来支援，我是回来要和你们一块建设自己的家乡！”说罢，姑娘咯咯……笑起来了，那笑声像被拨动的琴弦一样，和着热烈的鼓声和锛声，使这苍青古老的山头，充满了幸福和自豪的情调。注：桑比：竹制乐器，声音幽静如洞箫。
