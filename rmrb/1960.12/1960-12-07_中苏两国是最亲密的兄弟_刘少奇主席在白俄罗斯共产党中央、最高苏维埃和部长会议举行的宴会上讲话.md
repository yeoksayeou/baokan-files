Xinhua News Agency, Minsk, December 5th: The following is the full text of Chairman Liu Shaoqi’s speech at the banquet held by the Central Committee of the Belorussian Communist Party, the Supreme Soviet of the Belorussian Republic, and the Council of Ministers on December 5th: Dear Comrade Brezhnev! Dear Comrades Mazurov, Kozlov, and Kiselev! Dear Comrades!

　　Our Chinese Party and Government Delegation is very pleased and honored to be here in Minsk, the capital of the Belorussian Socialist Republic, one of the important member republics of our great ally, the Soviet Union, for a friendly visit. First of all, please allow me to express our brotherly and heartfelt gratitude to you, the responsible comrades of the Belorussian Party and government, and the working people of Minsk, for your warm welcome and gracious reception. (Warm applause)

　　Although our delegation's stay here is short, this visit has left us with a deep impression. What we admire most is that your people are heroic people. Many of your leading comrades, together with your people, carried out extensive guerrilla warfare during the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union, heroically and stubbornly, severely打击[dǎ jī, strike] the invaders, powerfully coordinated with the Soviet army's frontal operations, until the final victory over Hitler fascism was achieved. The deeds of your heroic struggle are particularly close to us, the Chinese people. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the Chinese people also mainly adopted the form of guerrilla warfare to fight against the Japanese invaders. In those difficult days, every victory of yours in guerrilla warfare, like every victory of the Soviet army's frontal operations, was a great encouragement to the Chinese people. We regard your victory as our own victory. (Warm applause)

　　What also deeply moved our delegation is that the people of Belorussia, with the assistance of all the Soviet people, have not only rapidly healed the wounds of war in the short period after the war, but have also built Belorussia into a collective agricultural-industrial country, greatly exceeding the pre-war levels in your industrial and agricultural production and cultural and educational undertakings. You were indomitable warriors in the war, and you are also skilled laborers in peaceful construction. The brand-new and beautiful city of Minsk, built by you on the ruins destroyed by the fascist bandits, is a symbol of the brilliant achievements you have made in peaceful construction. This year, the Belorussian Republic has overfulfilled its industrial production plan and has also achieved outstanding results in fulfilling the task of selling grain to the state ahead of schedule. Our people are delighted and encouraged by the great achievements made by the fraternal Belorussian people and the Soviet people in carrying out communist construction, and we sincerely congratulate you on your new and greater achievements. (Warm applause)

　　Comrades, the countries of our socialist camp are a close-knit family. China and the Soviet Union are the closest brothers in this big family. The unity of the Chinese and Soviet parties, the two countries, and the two peoples is the cornerstone of the unity of the socialist camp, the cornerstone of the unity of the international communist movement, and the cornerstone of the great unity of the people of the world. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The unity of the Chinese and Soviet peoples is extremely important. If the people of these two countries are united, the unity of the people of the world will not be difficult." At present, the people of all countries in the world are facing the great task of striving for lasting world peace, striving for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and striving for the victory of national liberation, democratic freedom, and the socialist cause. Our common enemy—the imperialist group headed by the United States—is ferocious and cunning. They want to undermine our unity at all times. But their conspiracy will never succeed. The Sino-Soviet unity, built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, cannot be destroyed by any force. The Chinese people will, together with the Soviet people, make every effort to further consolidate and develop our great friendship. In this regard, I believe that our visit will definitely be able to make a contribution. (Warm applause)

　　May the great Sino-Soviet unity last forever!

　　Long live the great Soviet union!

　　Long live the unity of the great socialist camp!

　　Long live the great unity of the people of the world!

　　Long live world peace!

　　Comrades, I propose a toast:

　　To the brilliant achievements of the Belorussian people and all the Soviet people in communist construction,

　　To the health of the Belorussian Party and government leaders headed by Comrade Mazurov,

　　To the health of the leading comrades of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Khrushchev! (Warm applause)

    中苏两国是最亲密的兄弟
    刘少奇主席在白俄罗斯共产党中央、最高苏维埃和部长会议举行的宴会上讲话
    新华社明斯克5日电　刘少奇主席5日在白俄罗斯共产党中央、白俄罗斯共和国最高苏维埃和部长会议举行的宴会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的勃列日涅夫同志！亲爱的马祖罗夫同志、科兹洛夫同志、基谢廖夫同志！亲爱的同志们！
    我们中国党政代表团来到我们伟大盟邦苏联的重要加盟共和国之一白俄罗斯社会主义共和国首都明斯克，进行友好的访问，感到十分高兴和荣幸。请允许我首先为你们，白俄罗斯党政负责同志和明斯克劳动人民对于我们的热烈欢迎和盛情接待，表示兄弟般的衷心的感谢。（热烈鼓掌）
    我们代表团在这里逗留的时间虽然很短，但是这次访问给我们留下深刻的印象。首先使我们感到敬佩的是，你们的人民是英勇的人民。你们的许多领导同志和你们的人民一起，在伟大的苏联卫国战争期间，英勇顽强地进行了广泛的游击战争，狠狠地打击了侵略者，有力地配合了苏军的正面作战，直到最后取得战胜希特勒法西斯的伟大胜利。你们这种英勇斗争的事迹，对于我们中国人民是特别亲切的。在八年的抗日战争中，中国人民主要地也是采用游击战争的斗争方式，同日本侵略者进行战斗的。在那些困难的日子里，你们在游击战争中的每一个胜利，同苏军正面作战的每一个胜利一样，对于中国人民都是巨大的鼓舞。我们把你们的胜利看成就是我们自己的胜利。（热烈鼓掌）
    还使我们代表团非常感动的是，你们白俄罗斯人民在全体苏联人民的援助下，在战后短短的时期内，不但迅速地医治了战争的创伤，而且已经把白俄罗斯建设成为一个集体农业—工业的国家，使你们的工农业生产和文化教育事业大大超过了战前的水平。你们在战争中是英勇不屈的战士，在和平建设中又是劳动的能手。你们在法西斯匪徒破坏的废墟上建设了一个崭新的美丽的明斯克城，就是你们在和平建设中所取得的辉煌的成就的标志。今年，白俄罗斯共和国已经超额完成了工业生产计划，在提前完成向国家交售粮食任务方面也取得了出色的成就。我国人民为兄弟般的白俄罗斯人民和苏联人民在开展共产主义建设中取得的巨大成就感到欢欣鼓舞，并且衷心地祝贺你们取得新的更大的成就。　（热烈鼓掌）
    同志们，我们社会主义阵营各国是一个亲密的大家庭。中苏两国是这个大家庭中最亲密的兄弟。中苏两党、两国和两国人民的团结，是社会主义阵营团结的基石，是国际共产主义运动团结的基石，也是全世界人民大团结的基石。毛泽东同志说过：“中苏两国人民的团结极为重要，这两国人民团结一致了，世界人民的团结就不困难了。”目前，世界各国人民面临着争取世界持久和平，争取不同社会制度国家和平共处，争取民族解放、民主自由和社会主义事业胜利的伟大任务。我们的共同敌人——以美国为首的帝国主义集团是凶恶的、狡猾的。他们无时无刻不想破坏我们的团结。但是它们的阴谋永远不会成功。建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的基础上的中苏团结是任何力量也破坏不了的。中国人民将同苏联人民一起，作出一切努力，进一步巩固和发展我们之间的伟大友谊，在这方面，我相信，我们这次访问一定能够作出贡献。（热烈鼓掌）
    伟大的中苏团结万古长青！
    伟大的苏联万岁！
    伟大的社会主义阵营的团结万岁！
    全世界人民的大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    同志们，我提议：
    为白俄罗斯人民和全体苏联人民在共产主义建设中的辉煌成就，
    为以马祖罗夫同志为首的白俄罗斯党政领导同志们的健康，
    为以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏共中央领导同志们的健康，干杯！　（热烈鼓掌）
