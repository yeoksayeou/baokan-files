Riding Horses and Loving Horses
　　Xin Feng Processing Factory　Lü Shufang

　　To make a thoroughbred horse travel a thousand *li* a day, it must be well fed. If it is not fed and watered well daily, and not given baths and vaccinations, the horse will not be healthy and cannot travel a thousand *li* a day. Therefore, "riding a horse" requires "loving the horse." We use machines in production, and we must also take care of them. This is the same as riding a horse and loving the horse. As the saying goes, "A craftsman must sharpen his tools if he wants to do his work well." To keep the "tools" "sharp," we must take care of machinery and equipment and do a good job of machinery and equipment maintenance. Good equipment maintenance can not only extend the life of the machine, but also enable us to win high production speed and improve product quality.

　　Machines are constantly running, and there will always be wear and tear. Paying attention to maintenance can reduce wear and tear. Maintenance is daily upkeep. Machines are the production tools for building socialism. The state entrusts the use of machines to us producers, which is a great trust in us. Therefore, we should protect machinery and equipment, and regularly lubricate, clean oil stains, dust, and iron filings, so that it is always clean. In this way, the machine will not get sick, or get sick less often. Repair is overhaul. If the machine is worn, it should be repaired as soon as possible to restore the worn parts and maintain the original precision. If you only seek a moment of pleasure and do not repair the machine when it breaks down, small problems will become big problems. "A stitch in time saves nine." This saying applies to mending clothes, and it also applies to the maintenance of machinery and equipment. If a small problem is discovered and can be repaired with very little manpower and material resources in a very short period of time, but is not repaired, and the small problem becomes a big problem, requiring "nine stitches" to repair, it will take more manpower, material resources and time.

　　Although machinery and equipment have no life and cannot speak, they understand "human feelings" very well. If you treat it well, often lubricate it, bathe it, remove dust and iron filings, and carry out regular maintenance, it will be at your disposal, play a high efficiency, and help you win high production speed; otherwise, it will get sick, drag you back, and make it impossible to complete the production plan. A comrade in our workshop used a milling machine, and he only cared about creating a high production record for a while, and did not maintain the machine tool well. Later, this bed got sick, and he was eager to produce, so this bed had to work while sick, and as a result, it worked and rested intermittently, three days of fishing, two days of drying nets. This practice of riding a horse without loving the horse made it impossible to keep up with the quantity and quality of production. Recently, we concentrated our superior forces to overhaul this milling machine. The overhauled milling machine is like a new one. The shift output has doubled compared with before the overhaul, and the product quality has also been greatly improved.

　　The attitude towards machines is one of the important aspects of testing our attitude towards social wealth. People with a high degree of socialist consciousness always appear in the posture of masters everywhere, always take the interests of the country and the people as the most important, and take extra care of public property. Therefore, a machine can only be used for five years by others, but they can use it for ten or even fifteen years, and the machine is always good, sometimes not even a piece of paint is worn off. People with low ideological consciousness are just the opposite. Their principle of handling affairs is to put private interests before public interests, or even forget public interests for private interests. They always think that their own tools and other things are lovely, and public things can be casual, even arbitrarily ruined. Therefore, a new machine that could have been used for five years is broken in one year when it is put in their hands. Two attitudes and two results reflect two different ideological styles. We workers are the masters of the country and the masters of machines. What we want to promote is the former ideological style, and what we oppose is the latter ideological style. Only when everyone takes good care of machinery and equipment can it exert greater power in socialist construction.

    骑马和爱马
    新风加工厂　吕树芳
    要想使千里马日行千里，就必须把它饲养好。如果日常不让它吃好、喝足，不给它洗澡和打预防针，马的身体不健康，就不能日行千里。所以说“骑马”就要“爱马”。我们生产使用的是机器，也要爱护机器。这和骑马要爱马一样。俗语说：“工欲善其事，必先利其器”。要使“器”保持“利”，就必须爱护机器设备，作好机器设备维修，设备维修的好，不但能延长机器的寿命，还能使我们赢得生产的高速度，提高产品的质量。
    机器经常运转，总会有磨损的。注意维修，就可以磨损得轻一些。维，就是日常维护。机器是建设社会主义的生产工具，国家把机器交给我们生产者使用，这是对我们的莫大信任。因此，我们应该保护机器设备，经常给它润滑、清擦油泥、灰尘、铁屑，使它总是干干净净的。这样，就可以使机器不生病，或者少生病。修，就是检修。机器磨损了，就要及早修理，使磨损部分恢复，保持原有的精度。如果只图一时干个痛快，出了毛病不修理，就会使小毛病变成大毛病。“小洞不补，大洞一尺五”。这话是说补衣服，对机器设备维修也是一样。发现了小毛病，用很少的人力、物力，在很短的时间内能修理好而不去修理，待小毛病变成了大毛病，来个“一尺五”再修理，就要费更多的人力、物力和时间。
    机器设备虽然没有生命，不会说话，但是，它很懂得“人情”。你对它好，常常给它润滑、洗澡，清除灰尘、铁屑，定期检修，它就会随你使用，发挥高效率，帮助你赢得生产高速度；反之，它就要生病，拖住你的后腿，使生产计划不能完成。我们车间有个同志使用一台铣床，他只顾一时创高产记录，对机床维修的不好。后来这台床子就生了病，他又急于生产，这台床子只好带病干活，结果干一干、歇一歇，三天打鱼，两天晒网。这种骑马又不爱马的作法，使生产的数量和质量都跟不上去。最近，我们集中优势兵力，检修了这台铣床，检修后的铣床像新的一样，班产量比检修前提高一倍，产品质量也大大提高了。
    对待机器的态度，是检验我们对社会财富的态度的重要方面之一。有高度社会主义觉悟的人，总是处处以主人翁的姿态出现，总是以国家和人民的利益为重，对公共财产备加爱护，因而一台机器在别人只能使用五年，他们却可以使用十年甚至十五年，而且机器总是好好的，有时甚至连一块漆皮也没有磨掉。思想觉悟低的人就恰好相反，他们处事的原则是先私后公，甚至私而忘公，总是觉得自己的工具等物可爱，公家的东西就可以漫不经心，甚至任意糟蹋，因而一台新机器本来可以使用五年的，但是放到他们手里，一年就坏了。两种态度、两种结果，反映了两种不同的思想作风。我们工人是国家的主人，也是机器的主人，我们要提倡的是前一种思想作风，而反对后一种思想作风，人人都精心爱护机器设备，才能使它在社会主义建设中发挥更大的威力。
