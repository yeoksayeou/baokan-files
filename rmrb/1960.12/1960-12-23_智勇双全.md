Wise and Courageous

Tao Youzhi, worker at Shanghai Tongxing Industrial Cooperative

Huang Xianhui, the Party Branch Secretary of the Xixi Brigade in Hedi Commune, Longquan County, Zhejiang Province, consistently performed well in labor but wasn't good at discussing issues with the masses. The commune members said he was "courageous but lacking in wisdom." Later, he changed his leadership style, consulting with the masses on everything. He successfully completed tasks such as harvesting sweet potatoes and accumulating fertilizer, and the masses praised him with satisfaction, calling him a "wise and courageous" good cadre.

"Courage" means that we can step forward in the face of danger and emergencies, unafraid of difficulties, with the ambition to dare to struggle and dare to win; "wisdom" means that in specific struggles and work, we must study combat methods, work steps, and leadership art. Courage and wisdom are like our hands and brain, inseparable and indispensable. If there is courage without wisdom, no matter what, we still cannot achieve victory. Conversely, if there is no courage, there is naturally nothing to speak of in terms of wisdom.

"Courageous but lacking in wisdom"—the masses' criticism is very apt. The work we are doing now is an unprecedented revolutionary undertaking to completely change the "poor and blank" face of our motherland. Facing such a magnificent revolutionary cause, can we succeed by relying solely on the hard work of one, two, or a few people? Can we be competent with only the wisdom and great courage of a few of us? No! The power of a few is always limited. Only when the masses are mobilized can this force move mountains and overturn seas, can it make high mountains bow and rivers give way. Chairman Mao said, "When the masses are of one heart, everything becomes easy to handle." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol. IV, p. 1317)

From this, it is evident that to complete this magnificent revolutionary undertaking, to victoriously accomplish the glorious tasks assigned to us by the Party, relying solely on one person's courage is not enough; we should also be good at "wisdom." How to "devise"? It is to rely on the masses, trust the masses, consult with the masses on everything. We must both lead the masses, be teachers of the masses, and, more importantly, be students of the masses, learning from the masses. Understand the pain of the masses, grasp the trends of the masses, and at any time implement the Party's policies among the masses, so that they are understood and mastered by the masses. Once the Party's policies are understood and mastered by the masses, they can generate infinite material strength. Whether we can "devise" well depends on whether we can mobilize the masses, especially whether we can deliver the Party's policies to the masses in a timely manner.

    智勇双全
    上海同兴实业社工人  陶友之
    浙江龙泉县荷地公社西溪大队有位总支书记黄先辉，他劳动一贯很好，就是不善于和群众商量问题。社员说他“有勇无谋”。后来他改变了领导方法，凡事和群众商量，胜利地完成了收薯积肥等工作，群众都很满意地称赞他，说他是“智勇双全”的好干部。
    “勇”，是指我们凡遇险事、急事能挺身而出，不畏艰巨，不畏困难，有敢于斗争，敢于取胜的雄心壮志；“谋”是指我们在具体斗争中，具体工作中要研究作战方法，工作步骤，领导艺术。勇与谋好似我们的手和脑一样，是不能分割的，缺一不行。如果有勇无谋，任何事情仍然不能取得胜利，反之，如果没有勇，当然谈不上什么谋。
    “有勇无谋”，群众批评得很对。现在我们所做的工作是史无前例的革命工作，是要彻底改变祖国“一穷二白”的面貌。面对这样宏伟的革命事业，单靠我们一个人，两个人，少数人的埋头苦干能干得了吗？单有我们少数人的智慧和天大的勇气能胜任了吗？不！少数人的力量总是有限的，只有群众发动起来，这股力量才能移山倒海，才能使高山低头，河水让路。毛主席说：“群众齐心了，一切事情就好办了。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷1317页）
    由此可见，我们要完成这个宏伟的革命事业，要胜利地完成党所交给我们的光荣任务，单靠一人的勇是不够的，而我们应该同时善于“谋”。怎样“谋”？就是要依靠群众、相信群众，有事和群众多商量，既要领导群众，做群众的先生，但更应做群众的学生，向群众学习。了解群众的痛痒，抓群众的动向，随时把党的政策贯彻到群众中去，为群众所了解，所掌握。党的政策一旦为群众所了解所掌握，就能产生无穷的物质力量，我们能不能“谋”好，就看我们能不能发动群众，特别是能不能把党的政策及时地交给群众。
