    Protest Against the Bloody Atrocities of the French Colonialists

    The people in the French-occupied area of Algeria have risen up. In Algiers, Oran, Orléansville, Constantine, and other places, mass demonstrations against French colonial rule have erupted since December 9th. Tens of thousands of Algerian patriotic people have taken to the streets, braving the bullets of the colonialists, shouting "Long live the Algerian National Liberation Front," "Abbas in power," and "Algeria for the Algerians!" They raised the sacred flag of the Republic of Algeria high on buildings in the heart of Algiers, where the French colonialists are entrenched.

    The struggle of the people in the French-occupied area of Algeria for independence is taking place precisely when the head of the French colonialists, De Gaulle, went to Algeria to peddle the conspiracy of a so-called "referendum." The French colonialists attempted to impose a so-called "public administration" on the Algerian people through this "referendum," and thereby divide the territory of Algeria, curb the Algerian national independence movement, and continue to maintain its colonial rule in Algeria. However, no matter what tricks De Gaulle, representing the French colonialists, plays, he cannot deceive the Algerian people. The patriotic mass demonstrations that erupted in Algiers and other cities have once again shown the world the unwavering will of all Algerian patriotic people to strive for national independence.

    However, the brutal French colonialists妄想 attempt to drown the patriotic and just struggle of the Algerian urban residents, which is rising powerfully, in blood. The French colonial authorities dispatched paratroopers, police, and even armored vehicles to carry out bloody suppression of the patriotic residents of Algerian cities. According to figures from French Radio Paris, which are obviously greatly reduced, in Algiers alone, eighty Algerians were massacred and one thousand five hundred were wounded on December 11th. Now, the French government is still sending more paratrooper regiments to Algiers, and the massacre is still continuing. This atrocity of the French colonialists cannot but arouse more resolute resistance from the Algerian people, and cannot but arouse the indignation and strong protests of all peace-loving people in the world.

    Abbas, the Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, and Algerian trade unions, university students, youth, and women's organizations have made an urgent appeal to peace-loving countries and people around the world, demanding that immediate measures be taken to stop the barbaric crimes of the French colonialists. Africa and all peace-loving countries and people around the world are taking action to respond to the just call from Algeria. The Moroccan government has lodged a strong protest against the bloody massacre carried out by the French colonialists in Algerian cities. The Moroccan Cabinet meeting issued a communiqué expressing support for the Algerian people's struggle for independence and freedom. The Moroccan News Agency and *Al Anoual* published editorials pointing out that the new outbreak of the patriotic struggle of Algerian city residents "shows the Algerian people's desire to obtain independence, freedom, and liberation from the shackles of colonialism." Some people in Tunisia and Algeria have also emphasized that the unarmed Algerian people exposed their chests to the automatic weapons aimed at them and once again held a referendum in front of the whole world, showing their determination to win their independence.

    The Chinese people angrily condemn the bloody atrocities of the French colonialists in Algeria, and firmly support the just struggle of the people in the French-occupied area of Algeria for independence and freedom. In his reply to Prime Minister Abbas on December 13th, our Premier Zhou Enlai expressed the infinite indignation and strongest protest of the 650 million Chinese people against the atrocities of the French colonialists in massacring Algerian people on a large scale in Algiers and other cities, and expressed the greatest respect to the Algerian people who are bravely resisting French colonialism.

    The Chinese people believe that the French colonialists can neither use deceptive conspiracies nor bloody suppression to save themselves from their doomed fate in Algeria. The blood of Algerian patriotic heroes will never be shed in vain, and the heroic Algerian people will surely follow in the footsteps of the martyrs and fight to the end for independence and freedom!

### 抗议法国殖民者的血腥暴行

    抗议法国殖民者的血腥暴行
    阿尔及利亚法国占领区的人民起来了。在阿尔及尔、奥兰、奥尔良维尔、君士坦丁等地，从12月9日起爆发了反抗法国殖民统治的具有广泛群众性的示威游行。成千成万的阿尔及利亚爱国人民走上街头，他们冒着殖民者的枪林弹雨，高呼“阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线万岁”、“阿巴斯执政”、“阿尔及利亚人的阿尔及利亚！”他们在法国殖民者盘踞的心脏——阿尔及尔的建筑物上高高地升起了阿尔及利亚共和国的神圣的国旗。
    阿尔及利亚法国占领区人民争取独立的斗争，正是发生在法国殖民者的头子戴高乐到阿尔及利亚去兜售什么“公民投票”的阴谋诡计的时候。法国殖民者企图通过这个“公民投票”把一个所谓阿尔及利亚的“公共行政机构”强加于阿尔及利亚人民，并以此来分裂阿尔及利亚的领土，遏制阿尔及利亚的民族独立运动，继续维护它在阿尔及利亚的殖民统治。但是，戴高乐所代表的法国殖民主义者不管玩弄什么花招，都瞒不过阿尔及利亚人民。阿尔及尔等城市爆发的人民爱国大示威，再一次向全世界表明了全体阿尔及利亚爱国人民争取民族独立的不可动摇的意志。
    但是，残暴成性的法国殖民者妄想把正在强大地兴起的阿尔及利亚城市居民的爱国正义斗争淹没在血泊里。法国殖民当局出动伞兵、警察、甚至出动了装甲车对阿尔及利亚的城市爱国居民进行血腥镇压。据法国巴黎电台显然是大大缩小了的数字，仅在阿尔及尔，12月11日一天中就有八十名阿尔及利亚人被屠杀，一千五百人被打伤。现在，法国政府还在增派伞兵团到阿尔及尔，大屠杀仍在继续着。法国殖民者的这一暴行，不能不激起阿尔及利亚人民更坚决的反抗，不能不激起全世界一切爱好和平人民的义愤和强烈的抗议。
    阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯和阿尔及利亚的工会、大学生、青年、妇女组织已经向全世界爱好和平的国家和人民紧急呼吁，要求立即采取措施，以制止法国殖民者的野蛮罪行。非洲和全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民，正在行动起来，响应来自阿尔及利亚的正义的呼吁。摩洛哥政府已就法国殖民主义者在阿尔及利亚城市进行的血腥大屠杀提出了强烈的抗议。摩洛哥内阁会议发表公报，表示支援阿尔及利亚人民争取独立和自由的斗争。摩洛哥通讯社和《黎明报》发表社论指出，阿尔及利亚城市居民爱国斗争的新爆发，“表明了阿尔及利亚人民渴望从殖民主义的桎梏下取得独立、自由和解放”。突尼斯和阿尔及利亚的一些人士也强调指出：徒手的阿尔及利亚人民把自己的胸脯暴露在瞄准他们的自动武器之前，再一次在全世界面前举行了公民投票，表明他们决心要赢得他们的独立。
    中国人民愤怒地谴责法国殖民者在阿尔及利亚的血腥暴行，并且坚决支持阿尔及利亚法国占领区人民争取独立和自由的正义斗争。我国周恩来总理在12月13日致阿巴斯总理的复电中，表达了六亿五千万中国人民对于法国殖民主义者在阿尔及尔和其他城市大规模屠杀阿尔及利亚人民的暴行，表示无限愤慨和最强烈的抗议，并且对于英勇反抗法国殖民主义者的阿尔及利亚人民表示极大的敬意。
    中国人民相信，法国殖民者既不能用欺骗的阴谋，也绝不能用血腥镇压的手段来挽回它在阿尔及利亚灭亡的命运。阿尔及利亚爱国志士的鲜血决不会白流，英勇的阿尔及利亚人民必将踏着烈士们的血迹，为独立和自由战斗到底！
