	Caring for Teachers' and Students' Lives, Properly Arranging Teaching

	The Hebei University Party Committee, on the basis of actively improving the school's cafeteria work, recently adjusted the curriculum and class hours. Many courses have been carefully selected, and some minor content has been removed. At the same time, while ensuring key courses, the phenomenon of advancing on all fronts has been overcome. The weekly study time for students has been reduced from the original 54 class hours to 48 class hours, with eight class hours per day. This ensures students have sufficient rest and self-study time. After the adjustment, students generally reflected that this allows them to study in depth, complete assignments on time, and improve the quality of their studies.

	Northwest Nationalities Institute Has Good Living Management

	Leading cadres of the Northwest Nationalities Institute Party Committee go into the kitchen and personally take charge of living management; class teachers go deep into the dormitories to conduct ideological work among students, further boosting the morale of teachers and students and promoting teaching work.

	The Northwest Nationalities Institute Party Committee, in order to truly run the cafeteria well and ensure that teachers and students from different regions of the Northwest with different ethnic living habits eat well, eat hot food, and eat hygienically, first strengthened specific leadership over the cafeteria. Many students wrote big-character posters praising: "Politics to the cafeteria, the food has greatly changed, cadres go down to the kitchen, the food is hot and fragrant!"

	Advance Arrangements for Next Year's Scientific Research Work

	In order to meet the needs of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, and strive for a bumper harvest in agricultural production next year, the Shenyang Agricultural College, with increased grain production as the center, concentrates manpower and material resources to vigorously carry out winter scientific research, so that the 1961 scientific research work can start ahead of schedule.

	After the start of winter, the Shenyang Agricultural College Party Committee, according to the needs of agricultural production development, organized teachers and students to repeatedly discuss from top to bottom and from bottom to top, and determined the main task of the college's scientific research work in 1961. In order to complete the design and trial production tasks of inter-tillage and weeding machinery for field crops, harvesting machinery for tall-stalk crops, and vegetable cultivation machinery as soon as possible, teachers and students of the Agricultural Machinery and Electrical Engineering Department have formed four three-way combination groups with teachers, students, and workers participating, and are actively carrying out design and trial production using indigenous methods and a combination of indigenous and foreign methods.

	Scientific Workers Deliver Technology to the Door

	Scientific departments at all levels in the Yichun Special Zone of Jiangxi Province have dispatched and delegated a large number of scientific and technical personnel to the front line of agricultural production, focusing on production needs, to help grassroots production units carry out mass scientific research activities.

	After scientific and technical cadres went to the front line of production, they participated in technical design and experimental research as ordinary laborers and achieved great results. The scientific and technical personnel of the Qingjiang County Academy of Sciences, in order to help the commune open up new fertilizer sources, successfully experimented with extracting oil from the seeds of daylilies in the comprehensive utilization of wild plants. They also helped the commune train more than 20 artificial rainfall technicians, which was welcomed by the commune members.

	Small Hospital Does Big Things

    西北民族学院生活管理好
    西北民族学院党委领导干部下厨房，亲自动手抓生活管理工作；班主任深入宿舍，向学生进行思想工作，进一步鼓舞了师生们的情绪，推动了教学工作。
    西北民族学院党委，为了确实办好食堂，使来自西北不同地区、具有不同民族生活习惯的各族师生吃好、吃热、吃的卫生，首先加强对食堂的具体领导。许多学生写大字报歌颂道：“政治到食堂，伙食大变样，干部下伙房，饭菜热又香！”
    提前安排明年科学研究工作
    为了适应大办农业、大办粮食的需要，争取明年农业生产大丰收，沈阳农学院以增产粮食为中心，集中人力物力，大搞冬季科学研究，使一九六一年科学研究工作提前上马。
    入冬后，沈阳农学院党委，根据农业生产发展的需要，组织广大师生，经过自上而下和自下而上的反复讨论，确定了一九六一年学院科学研究工作的主攻任务。农业机电系师生为了尽快完成大田作物中耕除草机械、高秆作物收获机械、蔬菜栽培机械的设计与试制任务，已分别组成四个有教师、学生、工人参加的三结合小组，采取土法上马、土洋结合的方法积极进行设计和试制。
    科学工作者送技术上门
    江西宜春专区各级科学部门，派出和下放了大批科学技术人员，到农业生产第一线，围绕生产需要，帮助基层生产单位开展群众性的科学研究活动。
    科学技术干部到生产第一线后，以普通劳动者的身分，参加技术设计、参加试验研究，取得了很大成绩。清江县科学院的科学技术人员，为帮助公社开辟新肥源，在大搞野生植物综合利用中，用黄花子榨油试验成功。他们还帮助公社培养了人工降雨技术员二十多名，受到社员们的欢迎。
