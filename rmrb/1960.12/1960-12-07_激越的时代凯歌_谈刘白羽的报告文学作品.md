    The Passionate Paean of the Era
    ——On Liu Baiyu's Reportage Works
    Yi Zheng
    As a new and original literary style, reportage's formal birth and development are closely intertwined with our people's revolutionary struggles in recent decades. Especially from the League of Left-Wing Writers period to the great War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, and up to the eleven years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, it has always galloped across our vast era's life like a light cavalry and commando team, increasingly demonstrating its high combat effectiveness. Comrade Liu Baiyu, known for his reportage and familiar to a wide readership, can be said to be one of the outstanding soldiers in this light cavalry and commando team. His works have given readers a great deal of encouragement.

    Like many of our other excellent works, the author's works are like a raging fire, igniting the hearts of our contemporary heroic warriors, and encouraging them to seize victory in their heroic struggles against the enemy. In these works, we not only feel a strong motivating force and see the surging, intense waves of combat between the lines, but also see the serious political responsibility of a revolutionary writer.

    The author has always placed himself at the forefront of the great era, wholeheartedly acting as a soldier, and constantly honing the weapons in his hands to serve the great cause of socialist revolution and construction, acting as a "correspondent for the broad readership" of our era (Preface to "The Morning Sun"). It is on the basis of this lofty purpose that the author has always held a passionate pen tightly in the long years of struggle from the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation to the founding of the People's Republic of China, tirelessly galloping on the front line of battle. "We should always go to the front! That's where a creator's place is." ("Answering Questions from Wenyi Bao") That's right. You can see him in the artillery convoys on the snowy, windy nights of the Songhua River; you can see him in the trenches on the smoke-filled Korean front; you can see him in the soaring flames on the Fujian coast; and you can also see him on the silver-gray torpedo boats speeding ahead.

    This very valuable revolutionary spirit and combat enthusiasm have made the author's works not only of high quality but also highly productive. The fresh, progressive currents of life on the front lines of struggle, the great power of overcoming difficulties, and the happiness of labor creation are so intensely exciting to the writer that he yearns to express them and sing their praises quickly and in large quantities. This is why reportage occupies such a prominent position in the author's creative work. The reportage works of his that we have read, from the War of Liberation alone, include the following individual publications: "Impressions of the Era" (1948), "Fighting for the Motherland" (1953), "Swearing Allegiance to Peace" (1954), "Raging Flames" (1957), "Ten Thousand Cannons Rock Jinmen" (1959), "The Morning Sun" (1959), "Moscow Visit" (reprinted in 1960), "Torch and Sun" (Sixteen Years of Selected Works, 1956). This does not even include all of the author's reportage works. It is naturally not enough to judge a writer's labor achievements and significance solely by the quantity of works. However, this quantity can also tell us how diligent and enthusiastic the author is in creating reportage. Our era has many excellent writers who not only capture readers with quality but also write diligently and continuously, and Comrade Baiyu is one of them.

    In an article discussing his creative experiences, the author wrote a very profound and moving passage. He said:

    "In mythology, Prometheus stole fire to bring fire to mankind; our real-life heroes, however, are eliminating the fire of disaster from the world and raising the flames of victory..."

    This noble feeling can be said to be the keynote of his reportage works. It is not only a manifestation of the author's profound grasp of the essence of the great people's revolutionary struggle, but also explains why the author can reflect the rich content and profound significance of our real-life struggle in his works, and encourage people to fight heroically to create a new world. This characteristic runs like a red thread through the author's entire reportage creation, especially in a series of character sketches.

    Here, we must first mention "Raging Flames." This is a medium-length feature on the famous legless tractor driver Li Laicai. In my opinion, compared to the author's early character sketches such as "Lu Kang's Song," this work is obviously much more mature and full. Li Laicai's heroic deeds were already well known to the general readership several years ago, and many newspapers and magazines have introduced him to us. However, this does not prevent us from reading "Raging Flames" again and again. The achievement of this medium-length feature lies not only in vividly portraying the demeanor of a hero of the times, but also in guiding people to think about many serious issues in life with accurate generalization and strong lyricism. The author does not simply write a biography of the character, but rather delves deep into the hero's heart to grasp and express the prominent spirit of the times and the beautiful sentiments of the working class that he embodies.

    From the protagonist of "Raging Flames," the young Volunteer Army soldier Li Laicai, who is only twenty-two years old, the author not only sees the most beautiful spirit and sentiments of our era, but also sees how this spirit and sentiment can be generated, and the indestructible power that it derives. Li Laicai has suffered deeply from the old society, and even more so, he has the infinite joy brought to him by the new world. From an orphan who lost his mother at an early age and drifted around in the old society to a glorious Communist Party member and a first-class meritorious soldier of the Volunteer Army who has won military medals, the entire content of this drastic change in life is so magnificent, profound, and rich. Therefore, in order to prevent the work from becoming a general character sketch and to achieve accurate generalization, it is very necessary for the writer to have a high degree of observation and a generalization method that is adapted to it. On the one hand, the author does not let go of the main processes of Li Laicai's gradual awakening and maturation in the struggle; on the other hand, he focuses on highlighting the hero's great revolutionary determination in the face of severe tests, highlights the hero's communist fearless spirit, and highlights the hero's broad revolutionary mind.

    Especially from the sixth section onwards, the hero Li Laicai unfortunately falls down in a long period of struggle against the enemy. The peculiar cold of the Korean battlefield caused him to suffer severe and incurable frostbite: if the lower limbs are not amputated in time, then his life will be in danger. The young hero is very painful at this time, and he deeply misses his troops: "Where are the comrades? Where are they now? In Pyongyang? In Seoul? Are they fighting? Or camping? Anyway, no matter what, he is no longer one of them." - Although Li Laicai is very painful, he is even more sober. He fully realizes that his injury is glorious. For a Communist, physical torment and pain only prompt him to become more firm and prepare to meet new storms with even stronger perseverance. Therefore, Li Laicai was able to sing "The East is Red" in the midst of great pain that ordinary people could not endure, and when others said to him, "Lao Li! You are still happy, your legs will be amputated tomorrow morning!" His answer was so loud and firm: "Even if we are completely amputated, we should still be happy, comrades!" The author deeply loves our heroes and deeply understands our heroes. He does not avoid the hero's fierce psychological conflict in his tenacious struggle against difficulties and pain, on the contrary, he reproduces it with a high degree of truth. Through a series of struggle descriptions, he shows that the hero has victoriously reached the height of Party spirit and the height of his own life. We can see this kind of description that shines with ideological light in many chapters of the work. After Li Laicai was amputated, he only had half of his left leg and half of his right foot left. At this time, there was a moving conversation in the ward:

    Doctor Xu: Don't think too much, comrade! You were disabled for the sake of the motherland, and the motherland will naturally be responsible to the end... The motherland will support you for the rest of your life...

    Li Laicai: Yes, for the rest of my life, eating and wearing, but is that all I'm for? I'm only twenty-two years old, and I'll live my life like this...

    Little Xue: That's what should happen. You are people who have made contributions.

    Li Laicai: You go now! - You all go now!...

    If the medical staff is doing it with a "good heart," then this "good heart" obviously cannot understand our heroes, nor can it comfort our heroes. It is our Party and old Bolsheviks like Director Xu of the hospital who truly deeply understand the heroes. When Li Laicai found that his legs were not the same length after being amputated, and that he could not move freely even after being fitted with prosthetic legs, he was not discouraged, but a new and very brave decision was brewing in his heart. He firmly requested the hospital leaders to re-amputate his intact right leg! He said: "If I don't amputate it, I can only walk on crutches forever. If both legs are amputated equally, I can install prosthetic feet and truly stand up..." He "hoped that he could still work like an ordinary person." Li Laicai finally stood up with the care and support of the Party. Such a hero can do not only driving a tractor, but also things that are ten thousand times more difficult. The author deeply saw this. He wrote: "What he recovered was two feet? No, he recovered his entire life, an entire life burning like a flame." Because it is a life burning like a flame, the light and heat it emits are the strongest and highest. Because the author has poured all his enthusiasm into "Raging Flames," it can powerfully move readers, and readers also love this work and draw from it the strong strength to encourage themselves to move forward.

    Comrade Baiyu's reportage creation has diverse and wide-ranging themes. However, the vast majority of them are works depicting war. The people's revolutionary war is an extremely great and solemn theme. He strives to express this theme. In his 1950 "Answering Questions from Wenyi Bao," he said: "Take war for example! For some people, it is only death and fear. For us, the just people's war we are waging is an act of heroism and glory." This belief became the force that encouraged the author to depict the people's war. In the People's War of Liberation, the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and the artillery battles on the Fujian front that severely punished the Chiang army, the author wrote a considerable number of vibrant reportage works. They are collected in "Impressions of the Era," "Torch and Sun," "Ten Thousand Cannons Rock Jinmen," and "Swearing Allegiance to Peace."

    Even though the long river of time has passed, these works depicting war still read so fresh, vigorous, and rich. The reason for this lies in the fact that the writer profoundly wrote about the essence of the people's war, the rich and colorful spiritual world of the people in the war, and the heroes' heroic revolutionary optimism. Whether it is the three heart-stirring trips to the western front in "The Light of the New Society" or the magnificent scenes of struggle in "The Heroic Defense of Siping Street"; whether it is the large corps galloping across the Central Plains in "Crossing the Central Plains" or the joy of victory when "The Torch Lights Up the Yangtze River"... we can all see this characteristic of the author's depiction of war life. Its bright colors, its strong sense of being on the scene, and the writer's surging combat enthusiasm are unified.

    In order to further understand this characteristic of the author, we can focus on the collection "Ten Thousand Cannons Rock Jinmen," which he wrote in 1958-1959. Because this collection clearly marks a new level reached by the author in depicting war.

    This book, which includes eleven features and reports all depicting the war life on the Fujian front, is filled with the writer's irrepressible combat enthusiasm. The bright red artillery fire, the heroic struggle, the intense love and hate, impacted the author and prompted him to pick up his pen without delay. The author made this clear in "Firelight Illuminates the Ocean." He wrote: "Of course, when it comes to the spirit of the Weitou front, it is worth writing a huge book about it, and I think the person who writes this book will be the happiest person. But I think: at such a moment, when the artillery is shaking the earth and the flashes of artillery fire are shining on the faces of people all over the world, it brings hope to those who are fighting for freedom, liberation and other beautiful ideals in the forests and on the disaster-stricken lands; it sends the tolling of funeral bells to those who are trying to make a final struggle in the dark caves of Wall Street, at such a moment, let the people of the Weitou front stand in front of everyone immediately!" How passionate is this voice! It can be seen that the collection "Ten Thousand Cannons Rock Jinmen" is the product of this surging combat enthusiasm!

    A prominent feature of "Ten Thousand Cannons Rock Jinmen" is its skill in revealing the great achievements of our contemporary heroes and their magnificent spiritual world in the broad struggle life, and it is very faithful, without adding or subtracting anything. In the well-organized descriptions with varying degrees of detail, the writer wrote about both the "mountains" and highlighted the "main peak"; and he rendered those brand-new things in the struggle life all the more. We know that in his "Biography of Xiang Yu," which is about ten thousand characters long, Sima Qian devoted one thousand two hundred to three hundred characters to writing about the "Hongmen Banquet," and the battles of Julu and the defeat at Wujiang were also depicted with all his strength; because these three events were very capable of expressing Xiang Yu's character, Sima Qian did not spare his ink. And how many times more ink should be needed to express even a fraction of our real-life heroes.

    Following the author's pen, we came to the hot land of the Fujian front. Here, unfolded before our eyes is a heart-stirring picture of the iron fist of justice severely hammering the enemy; it is also a picture of the sunset of imperialism. Ringing in our ears is the thunderous roar of the punishing Chiang army and the roar of the heroic people. And the author poured so much passionate emotion into the many heroes in this turbulent and broad background. They are so unforgettable. Artillery commander Cui Deheng and ammunition handler Zhang Shifa both rushed out of the position holding the shells when they were so hot they were burning, risking their lives to ensure the continuous firing of the heavy artillery against the enemy; artillery commander Yin Daan pounced on the battalion commander who was making a phone call in the midst of enemy artillery shrapnel, protecting the lives of his class brothers with his blood; loader Guan Cichong loaded more than 300 shells in one breath on the artillery position, fainted, then poured some cold water on himself and got up again; and the immortal communist fighters An Yemin and Wang Bangde burned out a bright and clear sky with their own bright red blood... In the author's pen, these heroic figures appear one after another, endlessly. They are like steel, which can be knocked and ringed; they are the leading figures of our times. To the point that on the artillery positions filled with artillery fire, "it is impossible to tell clearly: whether the fire is brighter than the people, or the people are brighter than the fire!" Facing these tall and unparalleled heroes, the author wrote: "People who don't have this kind of spirit here will be ashamed and unable to live."

    However, the author still did not stop at this step. He wrote about the heroes' arduous battles, the ecstasy of victory, the joy of the sun on the front line, the wind and waves of the sea, the endless smoke and fire of war, and everything that was exciting on the front line, but at any time, he cleared away the smoke of war to discover the heroes' broad and magnificent spiritual world. The author believes that he must "see the treasures on the seabed of life through the waves, not only see them but also grasp them, not only grasp them but also express them." (Preface to "The Morning Sun")

    For example, in the days when ten thousand cannons shook Jinmen, the author knew that our heroes were not only firing out hatred, but also opening up buds of ideals at the same time. In his pen, they are all people with bright red hearts, courage and resourcefulness, noble feelings, and rich thoughts. Listen to the artillery officer in the opening "Ten Thousand Cannons Rock Jinmen" giving the order to fire on the phone:

    Don't touch that tower, the tower is a historic site. We will have to take a good look at it when we go there in the future! Aim at military targets, don't hit civilian houses and barracks, there is too much smoke, wait for the smoke to clear, and then aim at the target!

    What a heroic spirit! This strong voice, full of confidence in victory and the proletarian revolutionary humanitarian spirit, profoundly reflects the essence of the great people's war, and also profoundly writes about the powerful power of our army and the beautiful and rich emotional world of the heroes. In fact, this spirit and power are shared by the military and civilians on the Fujian front. On the beautiful Weitou front, although it is full of rubble, roofless houses, and numerous shell craters, the author saw that this "is only the surface phenomenon of Weitou Village's life, and the real life is fiery, shining with the light of youth, and full of laughter." Because standing on the Fujian front are not only the cannons that give the enemy a headache, but also batches of brand-new people, batches of young soldiers who are infinitely loyal to the socialist motherland. A front-line political department director talked about them like this:

    Do you remember! In the past, there were some soldiers like this, who were very brave on the front line, but usually they were sloppy. (Such soldiers had appeared in Comrade Baiyu's novels in the early years. Isn't Li Fahe, the "old fritter" in "The Invincible Three Warriors," one of them! - Author) It's not like that now. Go and see, they are so pure and lovely, even a little shy in front of you, but when they act, they are so brave, and they will hit wherever you point them!

    It is these new generations of the motherland who inherit and carry forward the spirit of Dong Cunrui, Huang Jiguang, Qiu Shaoyun, and An Yemin - the heroic figures of the Mao Zedong era, that constitute the basic scope of the content of Comrade Baiyu's works.

    The author not only reflected the people's war with great revolutionary enthusiasm and hard creative labor, and praised the great historical achievements of the people in successfully destroying the old world under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, but also showed a strong sense of responsibility as a revolutionary writer in reflecting the people's creation of a new world and a new life. For this purpose, the author ran to many places to welcome the "morning sun," to "pursue the footprints of heroes," to visit those people who are flying bravely, the grasslands of the Horqin Right Wing Rear Banner where the wind howls, the vast white wilderness of the Great Northern Wilderness covered with thousands of miles of ice and snow, the Jiangnan where orioles fly and grass grows, the singing forests, and the noisy collective farms...

    People who have personally participated in the arduous struggle to build a new China, and who have been tempered in the fire and blood of many years, will deeply understand the joy and preciousness of entrepreneurship! Comrade Baiyu wrote many new reportage works in the boiling Great Leap Forward years of 1958-1959 with this cheerful and exuberant mood. The collection "The Morning Sun" is a collection of them. In this book, what first attracts me is "A Splendid Picture of Life."

    The gray and tall dam of the Meishan Reservoir stands towering in a valley of the Dabie Mountains. Whoever comes here cannot be moved by its majesty and charm! But the author loves this reservoir from such a deep place: he sees that "doesn't the bright electric light also contain the sparkle of our history?" His emotional torrent rushes into the revolutionary flames of the Dabie Mountains in the early years, and into the days when the Dabie Mountains first accepted the fire of truth. The pearl-like glittering lights on the reservoir, the silver-like electric wires on the trestles, the roar of the machines in the power station, such a beautiful scene is certainly intoxicating; but the people on the reservoir, such as Zhang Shangjiu, a former female Red guerrilla fighter who is infinitely loyal to the Party, are even more lovable. This female hero sacrificed her own son here in order to protect her comrades. The author wrote: "Yes, we are people who have struggled out of blood and fire, we not only know what slavery is, but we also know how to crush the imperialists' enslavement of the people. History is always educating us, and the tragic past is constantly giving us strength; it is precisely those who have passed through the storm who are advancing on our own land today with an incomparably comfortable mood and enthusiastic steps. ..."

    This is the accurate answer to why our picture of life can be so splendid. It is very noteworthy that the author always summarizes the lofty significance of our cause through those colorful pictures of life in reality, and is good at profoundly linking the growth and expansion of all fresh things in real life with the traditions of the Party and the history of arduous revolutionary struggle. His works never stop at simply writing about things and superficially and shallowly praising, because this is not commensurate with the magnificence and depth of our real life; but reveals the beauty deep in our reality with great enthusiasm, showing its incomparable richness.

    In fact, why is it just the Meishan Reservoir that is so moving! In "The Morning Sun," how lovable is the "Yang Midnight" who sleeps in the sick horse shed and gets up in the middle of the night to shovel manure; and how inspiring is the enthusiasm of the Youli Society's men, women, old and young in the nearly "all-out" fertilizer accumulation movement! And how moving is the enthusiasm of the members of the Zhaoyuan County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China in studying agricultural science... The author only wrote a few things, and immediately led us into a boiling, joyful, and rosy world. And this was the place where the flames of war were the reddest more than ten years ago. Its drastic change is not a microcosm of our country's Great Leap Forward!

    The characteristics of Comrade Baiyu's reportage creation are also manifested in many aspects. For example, his tentacles for observing things extend very widely; in addition to focusing on depicting characters, his works are filled with sincere poetry, strong lyricism, and vigorous creative spirit. However, what is particularly worthy of our attention here is the spirit of combining revolutionary romanticism and revolutionary realism in his reportage creation. This is seen more clearly in his works since the Great Leap Forward in 1958.

    The author strives to view, observe, and reflect our real life and struggle from the height of the communist world view; this is the lofty revolutionary ideal, the great class enthusiasm, the heroic and optimistic tone expressed in his works, and the infinite enthusiasm for praising the fresh things in our life, praising the buds of communism, and making them shine brighter and more prominently, thereby not only reflecting our great era, but also playing a role in promoting the progress of the era. And all this is based on the author's correct understanding and analysis of real life.

    This extremely valuable characteristic can be seen in many of the author's other works in addition to those that we have already discussed in the previous sections. Although it is impossible for him to "shape" revolutionary ideal figures and "shape" various typical images in reportage works like creating novels and dramas, this does not hinder the writer's revolutionary romantic spirit from being brought into play at all. On the contrary, this enables the author to have his own characteristics in applying the artistic methods of combining revolutionary romanticism and revolutionary realism.

    "Firelight Illuminates the Ocean," the proposition itself is rich. In this feature, the author depicts a magnificent scene seen on the Fujian front - the firelight of the shelling of Jinmen and the firelight of the front-line steelmaking are intertwined. In this red firelight, he saw something much brighter than the firelight, that is, our heroic artillerymen. In the author's pen, their firm confidence in victory and strong revolutionary optimism are manifested from the solemn and arduous battle. They are both realistic heroes who are conscientious in their posts and go through fire and water in fierce battles; and they are also revolutionary idealists with a communist heroic mind, despising all difficulties and dangers, and striding forward. "Advancing in the face of the enemy's artillery fire" is by no means an ordinary thing, but a fierce struggle and a severe test. However, when the enemy's rain-like shells exploded violently on the front line, what our heroes thought of was: "The Chiang army officers and soldiers are all fools, using artillery to hit the earth, if they fire a few more shells like this, we will save digging deep when planting next year." They ridiculed how humorous the enemy was: "The Jinmen Chiang army is messing around, firing cannons randomly without a target, a lot of steel is sent here, and the comrades laugh when they see it." When the enemy's artillery groups were silenced, they ridiculed the enemy for "losing both the wife and the army"! Look at this spirit, is it not precisely the manifestation of a strong revolutionary romantic spirit rooted in the deep soil of struggle! Their heroic words, their laughter, arise from a deep understanding of the nature of the US-Chiang enemy; arise from full confidence in their own powerful strength; arise from the great communist ideals deep in their hearts. And all this is integrated with the writer's deep observation of reality and surging combat enthusiasm. It is precisely because of this that in the various firelights on the front line that are "more fascinating than the colorful aurora borealis," Comrade Baiyu saw "that what is surging and shining is not only the flame of iron, the flame of steel, but more importantly the flame of people."

    Having a broad perspective, a cheerful style, and making every effort to highlight the revolutionary optimism of the heroes in the arduous struggle and their magnificent feelings, this is the prominent feature of the revolutionary romantic spirit in Comrade Baiyu's reportage works. This feature is of the times, and is also reflected in the author's works.

    I think the achievements made by the author in the creation of reportage are of profound inspiration to us. First of all, the achievement was made because the writer kept the Party's teachings in mind and treated the solemn cause he was engaged in with seriousness. He said:

    Let our writers become the most active fighters in building the cause of socialism! It is particularly worth mentioning: let our writers use great enthusiasm and energy to cultivate young people! This is the basic responsibility of a person who believes in Marxism-Leninism. Because people cannot live forever, but everyone can make his due contribution to the communist tomorrow. ("Literary Miscellany" pp. 18-19)

    This is the most valuable revolutionary consciousness of a literary worker; this is the manifestation of the Party spirit of a literary worker. And after Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" was published, the direction of his literary creation became clearer, his thinking became more mature, and his steps became more firm. He said: "Revolution not only transforms people's social life system, but more importantly, it transforms the human soul. A writer must also be one who is transformed himself in the process from revolution to revolutionary victory. Not only that, but precisely because he is a writer, a mouthpiece of the times, he should transform himself more sensitively and thoroughly in order to guide others and transform others. ...Readers demand heat and strength from you, and you must always pursue the light and then spread that fragrant heat and strength. You must walk in front, your path must be correct, so that your path will become wider and wider." (May 3, 1942, Yan'an "Liberation Daily" fourth edition: "Combining with the Struggle Life of Reality") For more than ten years, the author has been advancing on such a correct and broad path guided by the Party, earnestly practicing it, and radiating light and heat with his works in the unremitting struggle. I think we can learn a lot from Comrade Baiyu's creation, but only this one is the most important and most precious.

    激越的时代凯歌
    ——谈刘白羽的报告文学作品
    易征
    报告文学作为一个新型的、具有独创性的文学样式，其正式的诞生和发展，是和近几十年来我国人民的革命斗争密切锲合在一起的。特别是从左联时期起，到伟大的抗日战争和解放战争，直到建国十一年来，它始终以轻骑兵和突击队的姿态，在我们广阔的时代生活中纵横驰骋，愈来愈发挥其高度的战斗力。以报告文学著称而为广大读者所熟悉的刘白羽同志，可以说正是这支轻骑兵和突击队中出色的战士之一。他的作品曾给予读者以很大的鼓舞力量。
    作者的作品，正像我们许多其它优秀作品一样，有如一团熊熊烈火，点燃我们同时代的英雄战士的心，鼓舞他们在和敌人进行英勇的格斗中夺取胜利。在这些作品里面，我们不仅感受到了强劲的鼓动力量，看到了字里行间那奔腾往来的浓烈战斗气浪，同时也看到了作为一个革命作家严肃的政治责任感。
    作者始终是把自己置身在大时代的前列，全身心地充当一名战士的，并且不懈地磨炼自己手中的武器，为伟大的社会主义革命和建设事业服务，给我们时代的“广大读者作个通讯员”（《早晨的太阳》序）。正是基于这种崇高的目的，从抗日战争和解放战争直到建国以来，在漫长的斗争岁月中，作者总是握紧着一支热情的笔，从不疲倦地奔驰在战斗的第一线。“永远应该到前面去！一个创作者的位置在那里。”（《答文艺报问》）正是这样。你可以在松花江那风雪深夜的炮车群里看到他；你可以在烽烟匝地的朝鲜前线坑道里看到他；你可以在福建海岸的冲天火光中看到他；你也可以在那昂头飞驰着的银灰色鱼雷快艇上看到他。
    这种非常可贵的革命精神和战斗热情，使得作者的作品，不仅优质，而且高产。斗争前哨上新鲜的、锐进的生活激流，战胜困难的巨大热力和劳动创造的幸福，是如此剧烈地激动着作家，渴望迅速而大量地表现它们，讴歌他们。这也就是为什么在作者的创作中，报告文学占据着一个十分突出的位置的原因。我们所读到的他的报告文学作品，仅仅从解放战争以来，就有这样一些单行本：《时代的印象》（1948年），《为祖国而战》（1953年），《对和平宣誓》（1954年），《熊熊的火焰》（1957年），《万炮震金门》（1959年），《早晨的太阳》（1959年），《莫斯科访问记》（1960年再版），《火炬与太阳》（十六年选集，1956年）。这还没有包括作家的全部报告文学作品。如果仅仅从作品的数量上去看一个作家劳动的成就和意义，那自然是不够的。但是这个数量也可以告诉我们，作者对报告文学的创作，是多么勤奋，多么热忱。我们时代有着许多优秀作家，已经不仅仅凭质量抓住读者，而且也勤奋地源源不绝进行写作，白羽同志就是这样的一个。
    作者在一篇谈自己的创作体会的文章里，有一节话写得非常深沉感人。他说：
    “在神话中说，普罗米修士盗火使人间有了火种；我们现实中的英雄，却是从人间消除那灾难的火，而升起胜利的火焰。……”
    这种高尚的感情，可以说也就是他的报告文学作品的基调。它不仅仅是作者深刻把握了伟大人民革命斗争的本质的表现，并且也说明了，为什么作者能够在自己的作品里，反映出我们现实生活斗争的丰富内容及其深刻意义，鼓舞人们为创造新世界而英勇战斗。这个特色，像一根红线贯穿在作者的全部报告文学创作、特别是一系列人物特写中。
    在这里，我们要首先提到《熊熊的火焰》。这是一部关于著名无脚拖拉机手李来财的中篇特写。我以为，较之作者早年的人物特写如《陆康的歌声》等等，这部作品显然是大大的成熟了，丰满了。李来财的英雄事迹，早在几年前已为广大读者所熟知，许多报刊杂志曾经为我们介绍过。但是，这并不妨碍我们一读再读《熊熊的火焰》。这部中篇特写的成就不特在于出色地勾画了一位时代英雄的生动风貌，而且贵在以准确的概括和浓重的抒情引导人们去思考生活中许多严肃的问题。作者不是一般地为人物立传，而是突进了英雄的心灵深处，去把握并表现他所包孕的突出的时代精神和工人阶级的美的情操。
    从《熊熊的火焰》的主人公，年仅二十二岁的青年志愿军战士身上，作者不光看到了我们时代最美好的精神和情操，而且看到了这种精神和情操何以能够产生，以及它所派生出来的无坚不摧的强大力量。李来财经受过旧社会的深重苦难，更有着新世界给他带来的无限欢乐。从一个在旧社会里自幼失去母亲、辗转漂流的孤儿，成长为一个光荣的共产党员，一个荣获军功章的志愿军一等功臣，这个激变的全部生活内容是多么瑰丽、深广和丰富。因此，要使得作品不流于一般的人物草图，而达到准确的概括，就非常需要作家具有高度观察力和与之相适应的概括手段。作者一方面不放过李来财在斗争中的逐步觉醒和走向成熟的那些主要过程；另一方面，更着力地突出了英雄在严峻考验面前的巨大的革命坚定性，突出了英雄共产主义大无畏的精神品质，突出了英雄人物博大的革命胸襟。
    特别是从第六节开始，英雄李来财在长时期的对敌斗争中不幸倒了下来。朝鲜战地奇特的酷寒，使他受了严重不治的冻伤：下肢如果不及时截掉，那么生命就危在旦夕。年轻的英雄这时是非常痛苦的，他深深怀恋自己的部队：“同志们呢？现在在哪里？在平壤？在汉城？是作战？还是宿营？反正，不管怎么样他再也不是他们中间的一个了。”——尽管李来财十分痛苦，但是他更是十分清醒的。他完全意识到自己的负伤是光荣的。肉体的折磨和痛楚，对于一个共产党人说来，只是促使他更加坚定，更加以刚强的毅力去准备着迎接新的风暴。所以，李来财才能在常人难以忍受的巨大痛苦中高唱“东方红”，而当别人向他说：“老李！你还高兴，明天早晨，腿就要截掉了！”他的回答是如此响亮和坚定：“就是把我们全身截掉，我们也要高兴呀，同志！”作者深深地热爱我们的英雄，也深深地了解我们的英雄。他没有回避英雄向艰难痛苦作顽强斗争的激烈的心理冲突，恰恰相反，是高度真实地再现了它。通过一连串斗争的描写，表现了英雄胜利地达到了党性的高度，达到了自己生命的高度。这种闪耀着思想光芒的描写，我们在作品的许多章节里都可以看到。李来财被截肢以后，只剩下半条左腿和半个右脚。这个时候，在病房里有一段动人的谈话：
    徐医生：不要想得太多，同志！你自己是为了祖国才残废的，祖国当然会负责到底……祖国会养着你一辈子……
    李来财：是，一辈子，吃、穿，可是，我难道就为这个吗？我才二十二岁，一个人就这样过一辈子……
    小薛：那也是应该的，你们是有功劳的人。
    李来财：你们快走吧！——你们都快走吧！……
    如果说，医护人员是怀着一片“好心”，那么，这种“好心”显然不能理解我们的英雄，也不能安慰我们的英雄的。真正深刻地了解英雄的是我们的党，是像医院徐主任那样的老布尔什维克。当李来财发现自己截肢以后两腿不一般齐，装上了假腿也不能行动自如的时候，他不但不灰心，而且，一个新的、非常勇敢的决定，在他的心里酝酿成熟了。他坚决地向医院领导要求：重新把那条完好的右腿也截掉！他说：“不截掉我永远只能架着双拐，要是双腿截齐就能装上假脚，就能真正站起来……”他多么“希望自己还能像一个普通人那样工作。”李来财终于在党的关怀支持下站立起来了。这样的英雄，慢道是开拖拉机，就是再困难千万倍的事情，也同样能够办到。作者深刻地看到了这一点。他写道：“他恢复的是两支脚吗？不，他恢复了整个的生命，整个像火焰一样熊熊燃烧的生命。”惟其是像火焰一样熊熊燃烧的生命，它发射的光和热，才是最强烈的，最高度的。由于作者在《熊熊的火焰》中贯注了自己的全部热情，所以它也就能够强有力地打动读者，而读者也酷爱这部作品，从它里面汲取鼓舞自己前进的坚强的力量。
    白羽同志报告文学创作的题材，是多样而广泛的。但是其中绝大部分是描写战争的作品。人民革命战争，这是一个极其伟大庄严的主题。他努力表现了这个主题。他在1950年《答文艺报问》这篇谈话里说：“就拿战争来说吧！对某些人只是死亡与恐惧。对我们来说，我们所进行的正义的人民的战争，正是英雄与光荣的行动。”这种信念成为鼓舞作者描写人民战争的力量，在人民解放战争、抗美援朝战争，以及福建前线严惩蒋军的炮战中，作者写下了为数很可观的富有生命力的报告文学作品。它们分别收在《时代的印象》《火炬与太阳》《万炮震金门》《对和平宣誓》等集子里。
    尽管时间的长河飞逝而去，但是这些描写战争的作品，读来仍然是那么新鲜、刚劲和丰腴。其原因，还在于作家深刻地写出了人民战争的本质，写出了人们在战争中丰富多采的精神世界，写出了英雄们豪迈的革命乐观主义。无论是《新社会的光芒》中三次激荡人心的西线旅行或者《英雄的四平街保卫战》中壮阔的斗争图景；也无论是《横断中原》里的大兵团纵横驰骋，或者在《火炬映红了长江》的时候的胜利的欢乐……我们都可以从中看出作者描写战争生活的这个特点。它的鲜艳的色采，它的强烈的现场感，与作家澎湃的战斗热情是浑然统一着的。
    为了进一步了解作者这个特色，我们可以集中到他1958—1959年写下的一册《万炮震金门》来谈。因为，这个集子显然是标志着作者在描写战争方面所达到的新的水平的。
    这本包括了十一篇全部描写福建前线战争生活的特写和报告，处处都翻滚着作家无法抑制的战斗热情。鲜红的炮火，英雄的斗争，浓烈的爱和恨，冲击着作者，促使他迫不及待地提起笔来。这种心情，在《火光照红海洋》里，作者说得非常明白。他写道：“当然哪，讲到围头前线的精神，这是值得专门写一部巨大的书的，而且我认为写这部书的人将是最幸福的人。可是我觉得：在这样的时刻，当大炮正在震撼着天地，炮火的闪光正在全世界人民的面孔上闪亮着，它为那些为自由、解放等美好理想而在森林中，在灾难的土地上，奋战的人们带去希望；它为那些在华尔街阴暗的洞窟里，妄图最后挣扎的人们传去送丧的钟声，在这样的时刻，还是让围头前线的人立刻站在所有人的面前吧！”这声音何等激越！可以看出，一册《万炮震金门》正是这种澎湃汹涌的战斗热情的产儿！
    《万炮震金门》一个突出的特色，是善于在广阔的斗争生活中去揭示我们当代英雄的丰功伟业和他们壮丽的精神世界，而且非常信实，不妄加增损。在繁简浓淡安排有致的描写中，作家既写了“群山”，又突现了“主峰”；而对于斗争生活中那些崭新的事物，更是倍加渲染。我们知道，司马迁在一万字左右的《项羽本记》中，光写“鸿门宴”就占了一千二三百字，其他如巨鹿之战，乌江之败，也都莫不倾全力描摹；因为这三件事很能够表现项羽的为人，所以司马迁不吝惜他的笔墨。而我们现实中的英雄，该需要多少倍于此的笔墨才能表现他们于万一啊。
    我们跟随着作者的笔尖，来到了福建前线烫热的土地。在这里，拓展在我们眼前的是一帧正义的铁拳狠狠捶击敌人的大快人心的画卷；也是一幅帝国主义落日图。轰响在我们耳鼓的是惩罚蒋军的隆隆巨炮和英雄人民的怒吼。而作者就在这样激浪滔滔的宽广背景上，把多少炽热的感情向众多的英雄倾注。他们是那样令人难忘。炮长崔德恒和弹药手张仕发，都是在炮弹烤得发烫的时候抱着它冲出阵地，用生命的危险来保证重炮对敌的连续发射的；炮长尹大安是在敌炮的弹片飞迸中，扑向正在打电话的营首长，用鲜血保护了阶级兄弟的生命的；装填手管祠聪，在炮位上一口气装添了三百多发炮弹，昏厥了，然后在身上浇上点冷水又爬了起来；而不朽的共产主义战士安业民、王邦德，以自己鲜红的热血燃烧出了一片灿烂的晴空……在作者的笔下，这些英雄人物一个接一个，层出不穷。他们像钢，可以敲得铮铮作响；他们就是我们时代的尖端人物。以至于在炮火弥天的阵地上，“无法分辨清楚：是火比人亮，还是人比火亮！”面对这些高大无匹的英雄，作者这样写道：“人，在这儿要不具有这种精神，他会耻辱的不能生活下去。”
    然而，作者依然没有停留在这一步。他写英雄们艰苦的战斗，写胜利的狂喜，写第一线阳光的欢乐，写天风海涛，写滚滚不绝的硝烟烽火，写前线一切叫人振奋的东西，但是，他在任何时候，都是拨开了战争的烟雾，去发掘英雄们广阔而富丽的精神世界的。作者认定自己必须“透过波澜看到生活之海底的宝藏，不但看到而且把握到，不但把握到而且表现出来。”（《早晨的太阳》序）
    举一个例子。在万炮震金门的日子里，作者深知：我们的英雄们不仅是在把一股股仇恨打出去，而且在同时还把一朵朵理想的花蕾开放。在他的笔尖下，他们都是亮着红心，胆略兼备，情愫高尚，思想丰富的人。听听开篇《万炮震金门》里面这位炮兵高级指挥员在电话里下达的开炮命令吧：
    不要碰那个塔，塔是个古迹。将来我们去了还要好好看一看呢！对准军事目标打，民房和营房不要打，烟太大，等烟消了，看准目标再打！
    这是何其豪迈的气魄！这充满了胜利信心和无产阶级革命人道主义精神的强音，深刻地反映了伟大人民战争的实质，也深刻地写出了我军强大的威力和英雄们美丽而丰富的感情世界。事实上，这种气魄和力量已为福建前线军民所共有。在秀丽的围头前线，虽然是遍地瓦砾，透天屋顶和累累弹坑，但是作者看出了，这“只不过是围头村生活的表面现象，而真正的生活是火热的，是闪烁着青春光芒的，是洋溢着笑声的。”因为屹立在福建前线的不光是叫敌人头痛的大炮，而更有着一批批崭新的人，一批批对社会主义祖国无限赤诚的、年青的战士。一位前线政治部主任这样谈到了他们：
    你还记得吧！从前有些这样的兵，他们在火线上非常勇敢，但是平时却吊儿郎当。（这样的兵，早年就曾经在白羽同志的小说里出现过。那个《无敌三勇士》里面的“老油条”李发和不就是吗！——笔者）现在可不是这样了，你去看看，他们是那样纯洁，可爱，在你面前甚至还有点儿腼腆，可是行动起来是那样勇敢，你指到哪儿就打到哪儿！
    就是这些继承着和发扬着董存瑞、黄继光、丘少云、安业民精神的祖国的新生代，——毛泽东时代的英雄群像，构成了白羽同志作品内容的基本范围。
    作者不仅以极大的革命热忱和辛勤的创作劳动，反映了人民战争，歌颂了人民在党和毛主席领导下胜利地摧毁旧世界的伟大历史功勋，同时在反映人民群众缔造新世界，新生活上，也同样地表现了一个革命作家的强烈责任感。为着这个，作者跑过许许多多的地方，去迎接那“早晨的太阳”，去“追寻英雄的足迹”，去遍访那些勇猛飞翔着的人们，大风呼啸的郭尔罗斯后旗草原，千里冰雪的白茫茫的北大荒，莺飞草长的江南，欢唱的森林，喧闹的集体农庄……
    亲身参与了缔造新中国的艰巨斗争，而在长年的火与血里锻炼出来的人们，会多么深刻地理解创业的欢乐与可贵呵！白羽同志就是怀着这种开朗而奔放的心情，在1958年—1959年沸腾的大跃进岁月里，写下了许多新的报告文学作品的。一册《早晨的太阳》就是它们的结集。在这本作品里，首先吸引我的是那《一幅灿烂的生活图画》。
    梅山水库灰白色的高大水坝，在大别山的一条河谷里摩天而立。谁个来到这里，能不为它的雄伟和妩媚而动情呢！但是作者是从这样的深处来爱这个水库的：他看到了“雪亮的电灯光里不也包含着我们历史的闪光吗？”他的感情激流，闯进了早年大别山区的革命烽火，闯进了大别山区最初接受真理火种的日子。水库上珍珠般晶亮的灯火，高架上银丝般的电线，发电站的机器轰鸣，这样的良辰美景固然叫人陶醉；但是水库上的人，像对党无限忠诚的昔日红色女游击队员张尚久这样的人，则更加叫人热爱。这位巾帼英雄，当年正是在这里为了保护自己的同志而献出了自己的亲生儿子。作者写道：“不错，我们是从血里、火里斗争出来的人，我们不但懂得什么叫奴隶，我们更懂得怎样粉碎帝国主义者对人民的奴役。历史总是在教育着我们，悲壮的往事不断给我们以力量；正是穿过暴风雨的人，今天，在我们自己的大地上，以无比舒畅的心情、热情奔放的脚步前进。……”
    这就是我们的生活图画何以能如此灿烂的准确的回答。十分值得注意的是，作者总是透过现实中那些色彩缤纷的生活画幅，概括出我们事业的崇高意义，并且善于把现实生活中一切新鲜事物的成长壮大，同党的传统，同艰苦的革命斗争历史深刻地联结起来的。他的作品从不停留在就事写事，表面和浅薄地歌颂的地步，因为这是和我们现实生活的壮丽、深厚不相称的；而是以巨大的热情揭示我们现实深处的美，显示它的无比丰富。
    其实，又何止一个梅山水库如此叫人动情！在《早晨的太阳》里，那个睡在病马棚里，三更起来刨粪的社主任“杨半夜”，是多么可爱；那有利社的男女老少几几乎是“倾巢而出”的积肥运动，其热情又是多么振奋人心！而肇源县的中共县委委员们，钻研农业科学的劲头何等叫人动容，……。作者只写了不多的几件事，便立即把我们引进了一个沸腾的，欢乐的，朝霞绚烂的天地。而这里十多年前正是烽火最红的地方。它的激变，何尝不是我国大跃进的一幅缩影！
    白羽同志报告文学创作的特色，还表现在许多方面。例如他观察事物的触角，延伸得十分宽广；他的作品除了着力描摹人物而外，那真挚的诗意和浓烈的抒情，那生气勃勃，创造精神，都融贯在他的作品里。但是，在这里特别值得我们重视的是，他的报告文学创作中革命浪漫主义和革命现实主义相结合的精神。这从1958年大跃进以来，在他的作品中是看得更清楚了。
    作者努力站在共产主义世界观的高度来看待、观察和反映我们的现实生活和斗争；这就是他的作品表现的崇高革命理想，巨大的阶级热情，豪迈乐观的基调，无限热忱地歌颂我们生活中的新鲜事物，歌颂共产主义的萌芽，把它们照得更亮，更突出，从而不只是反映了我们伟大的时代，并且起了推动时代前进的作用。而这一切，又都是立脚在作者对现实生活正确的认识和分析上的。
    这个极其可贵的特色，除了显然见之于我们在前面已经谈到的一些作品而外，还可以在作者其他的不少作品里看到。他固然不可能像创作小说、戏剧那样，在报告文学作品中去“塑造”革命的理想人物，去“塑造”各种典型形象，但是，这丝毫也不妨碍作家的革命浪漫主义精神的发挥。相反，这使得作者在运用革命浪漫主义和革命现实主义相结合的艺术方法上，具有了自己的特点。
    《火光照红海洋》，这个命题本身就是丰富的。在这篇特写里，作者描绘了在福建前线看到的一种壮丽的景象——炮击金门的火光和前线大炼钢铁的火光交映在一起了。就在这一片通红的火光里，他看到了一种比火光还明亮得多的事物，那就是我们的英雄炮手。在作者笔下，他们坚定的必胜信心和浓烈的革命乐观主义精神，是从庄严而又艰巨的战斗中表现出来的。他们既是在自己的岗位上一丝不苟，在激战中赴汤蹈火的现实的英雄；更是具有共产主义豪迈胸襟，蔑视一切困难和艰险，高视阔步的革命理想主义者。“冒着敌人的炮火前进”，这决不是一件平常的事情，而是剧烈的搏斗和严酷的考验。然而，当敌人雨点般的炮弹在前线猛烈爆炸的时候，我们的英雄想到的是：“蒋军官兵净傻瓜，用炮光打大地瓜，像这样炮弹多打几炮，明年下种省深挖。”他们嘲笑敌人是多么富有风趣：“金门蒋军瞎胡闹，没有目标乱打炮，钢铁送来真不少，同志们见了哈哈笑。”他们在敌人的炮弹碎片还没有冷却下来的时候，就大批大批地收拾起来，投入了炼钢炉；而在把美蒋的炮群揍得哑口无言之后，他们尽情地奚落敌人“赔了夫人又折兵”！你看这气概，难道不正是植根于深厚的斗争土壤中强烈的革命浪漫主义精神的表现吗！他们的豪言壮语，他们的哈哈大笑，是产生自对美蒋敌人的本质的深刻认识；是产生自对自己强大力量的充分自信；是产生自心灵深处伟大的共产主义理想。而这一切，又都是和作家对现实深湛的观察、奔腾的战斗热情溶为一体的。正是因为如此，在前线上那“比彩色缤纷的北极光还引人入胜的”各种火光里，白羽同志看见了“那奔腾、闪耀的不仅仅是铁的火焰，钢的火焰，而更重要的是人的火焰。”
    高瞻远瞩，格调爽朗，全力突出英雄们在艰苦斗争中的革命乐观主义和他们壮美的情怀，这就是白羽同志报告文学作品里革命浪漫主义精神的突出特征。这个特征是时代的，也在作者的作品里体现出来了。
    作者在报告文学创作上所取得的成就，我想对于我们是具有深刻的启发的。首先是，这种成就的取得，是因为作家牢记着党的教导，严肃地对待自己所从事的庄严事业。他说：
    让我们的作家成为建设社会主义事业最积极的战士吧！特别值得提出的是：让我们的作家都用巨大的热情和精力去培养青年吧！这是一个信仰马克思列宁主义的人的起码的责任。因为人是不能永生的，但每个人却都能够为共产主义明天作出他应有的贡献。（《文学杂记》18—19页）
    这就是一个文学工作者最可贵的革命自觉；这就是一个文学工作者党性的表现。而当毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表以后，他文学创作的方向才更加明确，思想才格外成熟，步子才越加坚定了。他说：“革命不仅仅改造人们的社会生活制度，更重要的是改造人类的灵魂。一个作家，在从革命到革命胜利的过程，自己也一定是被改造的一个。不但如此，同时正因为他是作家，时代的喉舌，他应该更敏感，更彻底地改造自己，才好引导旁人，改造旁人。……读者向你要求热与力，你必需永远追求光明，然后播散那芬芳的热与力。你必需走在前面，你的路必需正确，才能使你的路愈走愈广阔。”（1942年5月3日延安《解放日报》四版：《与现实斗争生活结合》）十多年来，作者正是在这样一条党所指引的正确广阔的道路上前进，踏踏实实地身体力行，在不懈的斗争中以自己的作品放射出光和热的。我想，我们可以从白羽同志的创作中学到不少东西，而惟独这一条才是最为重要的和最足珍贵的。
