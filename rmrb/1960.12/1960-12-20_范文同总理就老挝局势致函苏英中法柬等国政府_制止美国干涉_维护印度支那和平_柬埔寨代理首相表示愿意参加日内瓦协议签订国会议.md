Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 19th: According to reports here, on December 15th, the Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Pham Van Dong, wrote letters regarding the current situation in Laos to the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, the Premier of China, the Prime Minister of France, the Prime Minister of Cambodia, the Prime Minister of India, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Poland, the Prime Minister of Canada, and the Prime Ministers of Mongolia, North Korea, Burma, Indonesia, Nepal, Afghanistan, Ceylon, Singapore, Guinea, Ghana, Iraq, Yemen, the United Arab Republic, Mali, Algeria, and Cuba. The letter stated that world public opinion is well aware of how serious the situation in Laos is. This is the consequence of U.S. imperialist interference in Laos' internal affairs.

The letter traced the evolution of the recent situation in Laos and pointed out, "The current situation in Laos is extremely dangerous. Peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia is once again seriously threatened. The 1954 Geneva Agreements on Laos are being wantonly violated by U.S. imperialism and its servants."

The letter stated that the blatant interference of U.S. imperialism in Laos and its consequences are causing great concern to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The consistent foreign policy pursued by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is to contribute to the maintenance of peace in Indochina, Southeast Asia, and the world, and to strengthen friendship with all nations, especially with neighboring countries. Regarding the Kingdom of Laos, we have repeatedly reiterated the need to thoroughly implement the Geneva Agreements on Laos, and on our part, we always respect this agreement."

The letter pointed out, "Faced with the U.S. imperialists and their servants invading Laotian territory and directly threatening the security of our country, we cannot remain indifferent."

The letter said, "The current situation in Laos confronts us with a crisis of war that is extremely harmful and likely to spread. The current task of all good people is to strive to find ways to extinguish the flames of war, and the only way is to stop U.S. imperialist interference in Laos and allow the Kingdom of Laos to freely embark on the path of peace and neutrality chosen by the Laotian people."

In his letters to the two Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference and the Prime Ministers of the participating countries of the Geneva Conference, Premier Pham Van Dong said, "We appeal to Your Excellency, in your capacity as leaders of the Geneva Conference participating countries, to take active and effective actions to salvage the current situation in Laos, to ensure that the government of the Kingdom of Laos implements a policy of peace and neutrality in accordance with the wishes of the Laotian people, and to contribute to ensuring the security of all countries in the region."

In his letter to the Prime Ministers of Asian and African countries, Premier Pham Van Dong said, "We appeal to Your Excellency, with your prestige and influence as leaders of Asian and African countries, to take active and effective actions to salvage the current situation in Laos, to ensure that the government of the Kingdom of Laos implements a policy of peace and neutrality in accordance with the wishes of the Laotian people, and to contribute to ensuring the security of all countries in the region."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 18th: According to reports here today, the Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Pham Van Dong, and the Acting Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia, Thai Phan, exchanged telegrams regarding the Laotian issue.

The Acting Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia, in his reply on December 14th to the telegram of December 10th from the Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Pham Van Dong, said, "Cambodia, in accordance with the Bandung spirit and the principle of neutrality, reiterates its determination not to interfere in the internal affairs of the Kingdom of Laos."

The telegram said, "Our country is vigilantly watching the serious developments taking place on its borders." The telegram stated that, in order to help re-establish peace in Laos and ensure the security of Southeast Asia, the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia, as it has done before, declares that it is willing to participate in a conference of the signatory countries of the 1954 Geneva Accords, invited by the majority of the Geneva Conference participating countries or convened by the two Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference.

This telegram from the Acting Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia, Thai Phan, is a response to the letter of December 10th from the Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Pham Van Dong, to twelve Southeast Asian countries. In his letter, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong requested these twelve Southeast Asian countries to take urgent and effective measures to stop foreign, especially U.S., interference in the internal affairs of Laos.

Premier Pham Van Dong, in replying to the telegram from the Acting Prime Minister of Cambodia, Thai Phan, on December 17th, informed the Cambodian government that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has proposed reconvening a conference of the participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference and restoring the activities of the International Commission in Laos, in order to re-establish peace in Laos and ensure the security of Southeast Asia.

    制止美国干涉　维护印度支那和平

    新华社河内19日电　据此间公布，越南民主共和国总理范文同12月15日就老挝当前局势写信给苏联部长会议主席、英国首相、中国总理、法国总理、柬埔寨首相、印度总理、波兰部长会议主席、加拿大总理和蒙古、朝鲜、缅甸、印度尼西亚、尼泊尔、阿富汗、锡兰、新加坡、几内亚、加纳、伊拉克、也门、阿拉伯联合共和国、马里、阿尔及利亚和古巴等国家政府总理。信中说，世界舆论都很清楚，老挝目前局势是如何地严重。这是美帝国主义干涉老挝内政所带来的后果。
    信中追溯了老挝最近局势的演变经过，并且指出，“老挝当前的局势非常危险。印度支那和东南亚的和平再一次受到严重的威胁，1954年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议正在受到美帝国主义及其仆从国的恣意破坏。”
    这封信说，美帝国主义对老挝明目张胆的干涉及其后果，使越南民主共和国非常担忧。越南民主共和国政府奉行的始终不渝的外交政策是，为维护印度支那、东南亚和世界和平，加强同各民族、特别是同各邻邦的友谊作出贡献。对于老挝王国，我们曾经多次重申有必要彻底履行关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，在我们方面，我们时刻尊重这个协议。”
    信中指出，“面临美帝国主义及其仆从正在侵犯老挝领土，直接威胁我们国家的安全，我们不能置若罔闻。”
    信中说，“当前的老挝局势使我们面临着危害极大和有蔓延可能的战争的危机。所有善良的人们当前的任务是，努力寻求扑灭战争火焰的办法，而唯一的办法是，必须制止美帝国主义对老挝的干涉，让老挝王国自由地走上老挝人民所选择的和平中立的道路。”
    范文同总理在写给日内瓦会议两位主席和日内瓦会议参加国总理的信中说，“我们呼吁阁下以日内瓦会议参与国的领导人的身份，采取积极的和有效的行动，为挽救老挝当前局势，保证老挝王国政府实现符合老挝人民愿望的和平中立政策，保证这个地区的所有国家的安全而作出贡献。”
    范文同总理在写给亚非国家总理的信中说，“我们呼吁阁下，以您作为亚非国家领导人的威信和影响，采取积极和有效的行动，为挽救老挝目前的局势，保证老挝王国政府实现符合老挝人民愿望的和平中立政策，保证这个地区的所有国家的安全而作出贡献。”
    新华社河内18日电　据此间今天报道：越南民主共和国总理范文同和柬埔寨王国政府代理首相泰潘就老挝问题互相交换了电报。
    柬埔寨王国政府代理首相在12月14日答复越南民主共和国政府总理范文同12月10日的电报时说，“柬埔寨按照万隆精神和中立原则重申不干涉老挝王国内政的决心。”
    电报说，“我们的国家正在警惕地注视着在它的边境发生的严重的事态发展。”电报表示，为了有助于在老挝重新建立和平和保障东南亚的安全，柬埔寨王国政府像它以前曾经做过的那样宣布，它愿意参加由大多数日内瓦会议参加国邀请或由日内瓦会议的两位主席召集的1954年日内瓦协议签订国的会议。
    柬埔寨王国代理首相泰潘的这份电报是对于越南民主共和国总理范文同12月10日写给十二个东南亚国家的信件的答复。范文同总理在他的信中要求这十二个东南亚国家采取紧迫的和有效的措施以制止外国、特别是美国对老挝内政的干涉。
    范文同总理17日在回答柬埔寨代理首相泰潘的电报时通知柬埔寨政府说，越南民主共和国政府已经建议重新召开1954年日内瓦会议的参加国会议并恢复在老挝的国际委员会的活动，以便在老挝重新建立和平和保障东南亚的安全。
