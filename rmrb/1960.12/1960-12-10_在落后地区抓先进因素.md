Grasping Advanced Factors in Backward Areas
Xiong Jinming, Party Branch Secretary of Chadian Management District, Qianling Commune, Guiyang

After the start of the "Three Autumns" production, our management district party branch decided to send me to the Shahe Production Team to take full responsibility for the work of this team.

The Shahe Team was a relatively backward team in its work. After arriving there, the first problem I discovered was that some cadres and party members didn't have enough enthusiasm. I didn't criticize them. The next day, I went to the Third Team. I knew that the Third Team was a relatively advanced team in this production team. When I got there, it was indeed the case. This team had a high political atmosphere, and the cadres and members were full of enthusiasm for production, each digging more than 270 jin of sweet potatoes per day. Then, I looked for the reasons why this team was advanced. After finding the reasons, I consulted with the cadres of the production team and convened a meeting of all the members of the team to promote the practices of the Third Team: we carried out political education, established an attendance system, and checked the participation of cadres in labor; in the production team, we rectified financial work. Afterwards, I went deep into the backward First Team, grasped the advanced figures in their team and praised them, and also gave specific help. The team leader, Zhao Zhenjiang, is now very enthusiastic about his work, and the work of this team has also improved.

From this incident, I realized that it is very important to grasp advanced factors in backward areas. In the past, we also often called on the Shahe Production Team to catch up with the Chadian Production Team, but they were never able to catch up. This time, I helped them discover advanced factors, cultivated activists, and established models, which strengthened the cadres' confidence and encouraged their courage to catch up with the advanced.

    在落后地区抓先进因素
    贵阳黔灵公社茶店管理区党总支书记　熊金明
    “三秋”生产开展以后，我们管理区党总支确定我到沙河生产队去，包干这个队的工作。
    沙河队是个工作比较落后的队。我到那里后，首先发现的问题，是有的干部和党员的干劲不够足。我没有批评他们。第二天，就到第三小队去。我知道第三小队是这个生产队比较先进的小队。到那里一看，果然不错。这个队政治空气高，干部和社员生产情绪饱满，每人每天挖红薯二百七十多斤。接着，我就找这个小队先进的原因。找到原因后，我就和生产队的干部商量，召开了全队的社员大会，推广了第三小队的作法：进行了政治教育，建立考勤制度，检查了干部参加劳动的情况；在生产队整顿了财务工作。随后，我又深入到落后的第一小队，抓住他们队的先进人物进行表扬，还做了具体帮助。小队长赵振江现在工作情绪非常高，这个小队的工作也有了起色。
    从这件事，我体会到：到落后地区抓先进因素很重要。以前我们也经常号召沙河生产队赶茶店生产队，但始终赶不上去。这次，我帮助他们发现了先进因素，培养了积极分子，树立了典型，使干部们增强了信心，鼓舞了他们赶先进的勇气。（附图片）
