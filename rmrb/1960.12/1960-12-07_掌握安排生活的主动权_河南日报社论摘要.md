    Take the Initiative in Arranging Life
    -- Abstract of Henan Daily Editorial
    "Extravagance leaves wealth wanting, diligence and thrift leave poverty with surplus," this is an instructive experience summed up by our working people in their long-term life practice. It is not only applicable to the past individual life of single households, but also has important guiding significance in today's collective life under the People's Commune system. The experience of the Weizhuang Brigade of Shangji Commune in Xuchang City vividly illustrates this point.
    Chairman Mao has always taught us to strive for initiative in battle and avoid passivity; and one of the important methods to gain the initiative is to think of the worst and strive for the best. Since liberation, especially after the people's communes, our industrial and agricultural production has achieved great development, and the lives of the broad masses have also been significantly improved. However, it should be seen that because the foundation left to us by the old society was too poor, our country has not yet escaped the situation of "poor and blank," and the foundation of the People's Commune is far from being strong enough; it should also be seen that although we are increasingly deeply understanding and mastering the laws of nature, we have not completely controlled nature, agricultural production is still unstable, and therefore collective life is often subject to fluctuations. Under such circumstances, we should think of the possibility of poor harvests next year when we have a good harvest this year, think of the possibility of poor harvests in autumn when we have a good harvest in summer, and think of the possibility of poor harvests in other places when we have a good harvest locally. That is to say, starting from the overall situation, thinking of the worst, striving for the best, prudently estimating all possibilities, while having several preparations, establishing several lines of defense, and fully exerting our energy, working steadfastly from all aspects. In this way, we can advance and attack, retreat and defend. In the case of continuous good harvests, we can make life more comfortable; in the case of encountering disasters or even continuous disasters, we can also get through it calmly, and always maintain a proactive position in production and life, and always maintain the speed of the Great Leap Forward.
    The reason why the Weizhuang Brigade can resolutely implement the policy of running the commune with diligence and thrift and rapidly change the face of production and life is because they have a strong Party branch, a good tradition of adhering to the Party's policies, and a set of practical and feasible systems. What is particularly valuable is that the cadres there have a high degree of awareness of caring for the lives of the masses. The Party branch of the Weizhuang Brigade understands that policies must rely on cadres to publicize and implement them among the masses, and many methods must also rely on cadres and the masses to come up with. Therefore, in implementing the policy of running the commune with diligence and thrift and arranging the lives of the masses, they first and foremost focused on the education of cadres. Because the cadres shared weal and woe with the masses, worked steadfastly, cared for people everywhere, and cherished the enthusiasm of the masses at all times, the political atmosphere there was particularly lively and the mass movement was particularly vigorous and powerful. Just imagine, what kind of difficulties cannot be overcome in the face of such a collective?
    In implementing the policy of running the commune with diligence and thrift, we should also pay close attention to taking practical measures. The experience of the Weizhuang Brigade tells us that the key to managing a thrifty life lies in starting early. We must not only publicize early, but also arrange early. We must know early in the year and always have a plan in mind. We must save at the top of the granary and leave some in the jar. We must start in summer and autumn and focus on spring and summer, and continue to conserve grain and plan grain consumption even after the grain is harvested. In this way, there is something to save, and it can be truly saved. Secondly, we must grasp firmly and practically. "Grasping without tightening is equivalent to not grasping." It cannot be a light grasp, nor can it be an occasional grasp, but it must be grasped to the end. After formulating practical measures, we must always go deep into inspection and supervision, with dedicated personnel in charge. Among them, we should especially grasp the leadership of the livelihood front, so that the leadership of the canteen is firmly in the hands of the Party branch and the poor and lower-middle peasants. We should also grasp the problems of grain and vegetables, so that the output is implemented, the rations are implemented, weighed and stored, managed by dedicated personnel, and can be used with emphasis, closely serving production. The key to grasping firmly and practically lies in conscientiously implementing the Party's policies and the working style of the mass line. Without the mobilization and education on policies and timely fulfillment, it is impossible to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses; and without the enthusiasm of the broad masses, even the most thoughtful plans, systems and methods will inevitably become a mere formality. Therefore, no matter what methods are adopted, they must be based on the conscientious implementation of policies.
    Arranging the lives of the masses is a serious and complex task related to the continued leap forward in production. As long as the broad masses of cadres and people act together, truly achieve diligence and thrift, careful calculation, considering the past and the future, and making the water flow slowly and steadily, we will definitely be able to take the initiative in arranging life and achieve results in a short period of time.

    掌握安排生活的主动权
    ——河南日报社论摘要
    “破费富不足，勤俭贫有余”，这是我国劳动人民在长期生活实践中总结出来的一条富有教益的经验。它不仅适用于过去单门独户的个体生活，而且在今天人民公社制度下的集体生活中，同样具有重要的指导意义。许昌市尚集公社魏庄大队的经验就生动地说明了这一点。
    毛主席历来教导我们，在战斗中要力争主动，力避被动；而争得主动权的重要方法之一，就是要从最坏处着想，向最好处努力。解放以来，特别是人民公社化以后，我们的工农业生产获得了巨大的发展，广大群众的生活也有了显著的改善。但是，应该看到，由于旧社会给我们留下的基础太差，我们的国家还没有摆脱“一穷二白”的状况，人民公社的底子也远不够雄厚；还应当看到，虽然我们越来越深刻地认识与掌握了自然规律，但是还没有完全控制住自然，农业生产还是不稳定的，因而集体生活也就经常有波动的可能。在这种情况下，就应该是今年丰收想到明年可能歉收，夏季丰收想到秋季可能歉收，本地丰收想到外地可能歉收。也就是说，从全局出发，向最坏处着想，向最好处努力，审慎地估计到一切可能性，同时有几手的准备，建立好几道防线，并且充分鼓足干劲，踏踏实实地从各方面努力。这样，才能进可以攻，退可以守，在连续丰收的情况下，使生活过得更舒适；在遇到灾害甚至是连续遭灾的情况下，也能从容度过，始终在生产、生活上居于主动地位，始终保持住跃进的速度。
    魏庄大队所以能够坚决贯彻执行勤俭办社的方针，迅速改变了生产和生活的面貌，是因为他们有一个坚强的党支部，有坚持执行党的政策的好传统，有一套切实可行的制度。特别可贵的是，那里的干部有着高度关心群众生活的自觉性。魏庄大队的党支部懂得，政策是要依靠干部宣传贯彻到群众中去的，办法也有很大一部分是要依靠干部和群众想出来的。所以，他们在贯彻执行勤俭办社方针、安排群众生活方面，首先突出地抓好了对干部的教育。由于干部作到了与群众同甘共苦，踏踏实实，处处关心人，时时珍惜群众的积极性，因而，那里的政治气氛就特别生动活泼，群众运动也就格外有生气、有力量。试想，在这样的集体面前，还有什么样的困难不能克服呢？
    在贯彻勤俭办社方针的时候，还应该十分注意采取踏踏实实的措施。魏庄大队的经验告诉我们，抓好勤俭过日子的关键在于早动手。既要早宣传，又要早安排。要做到一年早知道、心中经常有数。要省在囤尖、留在瓮口。要从夏秋入手、春夏着眼，收获下粮食仍然不放松节约用粮和计划用粮。这样，才有啥可省，并能真正省下来。其次，还要抓紧抓实。“抓而不紧，等于不抓”。不能是轻轻一抓，也不能是偶尔一抓，而必须是一抓到底。在制订了踏踏实实的措施后，一定还要经常地深入检查督促，有专人负责。其中，应该特别抓紧对生活战线的领导，使食堂的领导权牢固地掌握在党支部和贫农、下中农的手里。还应该抓紧粮食和蔬菜问题，做到产量落实，口粮落实，过秤入仓，专人保管，而且能够有重点地使用，紧密地服务生产。抓紧抓实的关键，又在于认真贯彻执行党的政策和群众路线的工作作风。没有关于政策的发动教育和及时兑现，就不可能把广大群众的积极性充分调动起来；而没有广大群众的积极性，再周到的计划、制度和办法，也不免流于形式。所以，不管采取什么办法，都必须以认真贯彻执行政策为前提。
    安排群众生活，是有关生产继续跃进的一项严肃而复杂的工作。只要广大干部和群众一齐行动起来，真正做到克勤克俭，精打细算，瞻前顾后，细水长流，就一定能够掌握安排生活的主动权，在短时间内做出成绩。
