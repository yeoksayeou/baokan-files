    Mom Changed Her Name
    Liberation Army Soldier Li Jixiang
    The room was quiet and empty. I gently placed my luggage on the kang. The room was clean, with whitewashed walls and a floral ceiling. A portrait of Chairman Mao hung directly opposite the door, and beneath it hung bright red certificates of merit and literacy graduation certificates, all framed in glass. On the small table in the center of the kang were newspapers and books. The graduation certificate had Mom's photo on it, and the name Wang Xuemin was written below. Who was this? I was puzzled.
    Mom had made so many jokes because she was illiterate! It was a headache. I remember when I was eight years old during the Spring Festival, every household put up couplets. That day, Mom actually pasted "Fat pigs fill the sty" on the wall facing the door of the main room. Neighbors and villagers came to pay their respects for the New Year, and everyone burst into laughter. It was supposed to be a happy occasion, but it ended unpleasantly.
    With a "creak," the door opened, and Yaqin came in. As soon as she entered, she shouted with a smile, "Ah! It's you!" She hurried over to pour me water, saying, "What, has the house changed after you've been away for three years?" Then, she pointed to the bright red certificate of merit and said as if she were announcing good news, "This is Mom's graduation certificate and award. Our mom has become a literate person!" After she finished, she giggled. With that laugh, she opened the floodgates of her conversation. One thing after another was mentioned like a string of firecrackers. She said, "After the establishment of the People's Commune, Mom initially worked as a nursery worker in the kindergarten. Later, the commune said that Mom was old and frail and let her stay in the nursing home for recuperation. Who knew that after she arrived at the nursing home, she complained all day that she had nothing to do, that she felt pain all over her body, and she insisted on being a cook! The commune had no choice but to agree. After less than a month, the commune developed the pig-raising industry and needed feeders. Mom again actively requested to be a feeder." I immediately interrupted Yaqin and asked, "That book 'How to Be a Good Feeder' was bought by Mom, right?" "Yes! After becoming a feeder, there were even more things to do, like development plans for pig raising, feeding techniques... you have to have a solid understanding of everything. You can imagine that without education, how can you do it! Mom remembered the suffering of being illiterate in the past, and her enthusiasm for learning is great! She arrives at school first every night, and when she comes home, she asks me to be her teacher, just like a primary school student." As Yaqin spoke, she took out Mom's homework from the drawer for me to see. From the initial crooked handwriting to the neat and orderly rows, it goes without saying that Mom put a lot of effort into learning to read. Yaqin finally said, "Mom got her graduation certificate, received an award, and everyone also elected her as a part-time work point recorder. She is very active in her work! Mom gave a speech at the county's conference of activists. That letter I sent you a few days ago, it wasn't written by me, it was written by Mom herself! And she thought her old name was too old-fashioned, so she gave herself a new name, Wang—Xue—Min. What a great name!" After she finished speaking, she giggled again.
    I felt as sweet as if I had eaten honey. I was about to speak when the door "creaked" again, and Mom came in. She was carrying a satchel. When she saw me, she happily stuttered and froze, but she quickly regained her composure. Then, she asked this and that with warmth and concern. I couldn't help but ask Mom with a tone of complaint, "Why didn't you tell me about your learning to read in your letters!" Mom smiled and said, "This little achievement is nothing! It's still far from enough! In the future, your Mom might even become a college student!..." Hearty laughter echoed in the room. Mom first smiled with her mouth, then with her eyebrows and eyes, all at once.
    After lunch, Mom put on her work clothes, put on her work hat, and went to the pig farm with a book in her hand, smiling. When she came home in the evening, Mom said to me, "The teacher didn't come back from the meeting tonight, so you give me a lesson!" As she spoke, she took the satchel off the wall and wrote something in her notebook skillfully. Yaqin chimed in, "You've learned all about the feed storage problem I told you about yesterday, right?" Mom replied, "I've learned it all. Today we're going to learn the lesson on developing the pig-raising industry." Then, Mom read it carefully word by word. I watched from the side. Mom only didn't recognize ten new words in this lesson, and she could clearly distinguish between "qing" and "qing," "jian" and "wen." Mom carefully wrote the new words. It was already past ten o'clock at night. I urged Mom to rest, but Mom put on her reading glasses and opened Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," saying, "This is my happy golden key!"
    I stared blankly at Mom's wrinkled face, and a feeling of respect couldn't help but arise in my heart. I said excitedly, "Mom has really found the golden key!"

    妈妈改了名字
    解放军战士  李吉祥
    屋里静悄悄地没有人。我轻轻把行李搁在炕上。屋里干干净净，白灰墙，花顶棚，迎门挂着毛主席的像，像底下挂着鲜红鲜红的奖状和扫盲毕业证书，外面全用玻璃框镶着。炕中央的小桌上放着报纸和书，毕业证上面贴着妈妈的像片，下面写着王学敏，这是谁呢？我在纳闷。
    妈妈因为不识字曾经闹出多少笑话呀！这是令人感到头疼的事。我记得八岁那年过春节，家家户户贴对联，这天，妈妈竟把“肥猪满圈”贴在堂屋的迎门墙上。邻居乡亲们来拜年，逗得大家哄堂大笑，本来是件高兴的事，却闹了个不痛快。
    “吱”的一声门开了，进来的是雅琴，她一进门满面笑容地喊：“啊！是你呀！”她忙跑过来给我倒水，嘴里说：“怎么，出去三年家里变了吧？”说完，她指着那鲜红的奖状像报喜一样地说：“这是妈妈得的毕业证书和奖状，咱妈妈变成文人啦！”说完，便咯咯咯地笑起来。这一笑，她的话匣子可打开了。事情一个跟着一个像点着鞭炮似地提了出来。她说：“人民公社成立以后，妈妈起初在幼儿园里当保育员，后来公社里说咱妈妈年老力衰，让她住敬老院休养。谁知她到了敬老院，却整天嚷没事干，呆得浑身疼，非要求当炊事员不可！公社只好答应了。过了没有一个月，公社发展养猪事业，缺少饲养员，妈妈又积极要求当饲养员。”我立刻打断雅琴的话问：“那本《怎样当好饲养员》的书是妈妈买的吧？”“是呀！当了饲养员事可更多了，什么发展养猪计划啦，什么饲养技术啦……都要心里有底，你想这没有文化哪行呀！妈妈想起从前不识字的苦处，学习劲头可大啦！每天晚上第一个到学校，回家来还让我当她的老师，真像个小学生。”雅琴一边说，一边从抽屉里拿出妈妈的作业本让我看，从开始歪歪斜斜的字到整整齐齐排成行，不用详说，妈妈学文化确实是费了一番脑筋的。雅琴最后说：“妈妈得了毕业证，受了奖，大家还选她兼职记工员，工作可积极啦！县里开积极分子大会，妈妈在大会上讲了话。前两天给你去的那封信，不是我写的，那是妈妈亲手写的呀！又嫌老名太不时兴了，自己还起了个新名，叫王—学—敏，这名字多好！”说完，她又咯咯咯地笑起来。
    我像吃了蜜似的那样甜，正想开口，门又“吱”的一声，进来的就是妈妈。她手里提着书包，见了我，高兴地扎撤着两只手楞住了，但又立刻清醒过来，于是，亲热、关切地问这问那。我不由得带有埋怨的口气问妈妈：“您学文化的事怎么不在信上告诉我！”妈妈笑着说：“这点成绩算个啥！还差的远着呢！将来呀，你妈我说不定还能当个大学生呢！……”爽朗的笑声在屋里回响着，妈妈先是嘴，后是眉毛和眼睛，一齐都笑起来。
    吃过午饭，妈妈穿上工作衣，戴上工作帽，手里拿着书笑迷迷地去猪场了。晚上回家来，妈妈向我说：“今天晚上教员开会没回来，你就给我讲一课吧！”说着从墙上摘下书包，熟练地在笔记本上写了一阵。雅琴一旁搭讪说：“昨天我给您讲的饲料保管问题都会了吧？”妈妈回答道：“全会了，今天该学发展养猪事业这一课了。”接着妈妈认真地一字字地读起来。我在一旁看着，妈妈在这一课上只有十个生字不认识，就连“清”和“青”、“间”和“问”都分得清清楚楚。妈妈仔细地写着生字，时间已经是夜里十点多了。我催妈妈休息，妈妈却戴上老花镜打开毛主席著的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，嘴里说：“这是我开心的金钥匙！”
    我呆呆地望着妈妈那布满皱纹的脸，心里不由得泛起一阵敬爱的感情，兴奋地说：“妈妈真的找到金钥匙啦！”
