Reported by our newspaper: The Party branch of the Nanben Management Area (basic accounting unit) of the Chengqu People's Commune in Lincang County, Yunnan Province, fully mobilized and relied on the masses to harvest, distribute, manage, and use the spring grain effectively.

The Nanben Management Area Party branch regards managing grain well as an important measure for distributing and using grain effectively, arranging the lives of commune members, and ensuring the sustained leap forward in production next year. They believe that the key to doing this work well lies in conscientiously implementing policies and strengthening ideological education, so that harvesting, distributing, managing, and using grain well becomes a conscious action of the masses. Therefore, around the start of the autumn harvest, the Party branch repeatedly explained the relevant policies on grain distribution and storage to the masses, inspired the masses to recall and compare the grain consumption situation before and after liberation, and educated the masses on balancing the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual, and on managing and saving grain. In the process of implementing policies, the focus was on publicizing four points: First, production teams must complete the production targets uniformly allocated by the management area and manage the centrally stored grain, so as to achieve "two guarantees" (guaranteeing the completion of the tasks of delivering public grain and selling surplus grain, and retaining sufficient rations, seeds, and fodder) and "three considerations" (considering the interests of the state, the collective, and the commune members). Second, the management area retains sufficient rations for commune members and the necessary seeds and fodder for each team according to standards, which are then stored separately by each team. Third, the management area resolutely implements the policy of rewarding excess production; the grain awarded for excess production belongs to the production team, and the management area will never transfer it. Fourth, on the premise of ensuring the completion of production targets, the small miscellaneous grains planted by each team on scattered land along the fields mainly belong to the team. Through repeated publicity, the policies were deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and known to every household. At this time, the management area announced the grain production situation to the masses, mobilized commune members to discuss and formulate a grain distribution plan, and, according to the principle of overall consideration, comprehensive arrangement, looking ahead and behind, and leaving room for maneuver, implemented the public grain, surplus grain, rations, seeds, fodder, and reserve grain one by one, so that everyone had a clear understanding. Because the grain distribution policy was implemented and fulfilled, it mobilized the enthusiasm of the broad masses for harvesting, distributing, managing, and using grain well.

Adhering to weighing and storing grain, and grasping the grain situation realistically, is an important link in this management area to ensure the effective distribution and management of grain. At the beginning of the autumn harvest, the grain co-management committee, according to the grain distribution plan passed by the commune member representative meeting, led the commune members to harvest and distribute grain simultaneously. Whether it was grain reserved for public use or rations, seeds, and fodder distributed to each team, the principle of weighing and storing grain was strictly adhered to, and a three-part storage receipt was issued to achieve "three alignments," that is, the grain harvested matched the warehouse; the total amount of grain matched the warehouse; and the accounts of the storekeeper, the production team, and the management area matched. Due to the adherence to harvesting and distributing simultaneously, and weighing and storing grain, the distribution policy was thoroughly fulfilled, which further mobilized the enthusiasm of the masses. Each team insisted on weighing and storing the grain harvested on the same day, plugging loopholes for spillage and loss. The Zhong Changmei work group of the seventh team had three loads of rice still uncarried back from the field at the end of one day's work. Some commune members suggested going back to carry it the next day, but Zhong Changmei said: That won't do. We must harvest and manage the grain well without loss in order to guarantee the completion of the co-management task and achieve the "two guarantees," so that the team will have excess grain. After she said this, two commune members immediately volunteered to go with her to carry the grain back and weigh it for storage. When each team was harvesting, distributing, weighing, and storing grain simultaneously, members of the management area's grain management committee, the production team's grain management group, and the grain storekeeper were all present to classify and record the accounts, so that after harvesting and distribution, all five types of retained grain were weighed and stored.

During storage, each team insisted on storing specific grains in specific warehouses, with fixed personnel responsible for storage. For example, the sixth team had eight warehouses, with one fixed warehouse temporarily used to store public grain and surplus grain; four fixed warehouses to store rations; one warehouse to store seeds; and the remaining two warehouses to store fodder and reserve grain respectively. The warehouses were numbered and assigned to eight active and responsible commune members for storage, so as to achieve "three non-confusion," that is, non-confusion of grain varieties, non-confusion of grain for different uses, and non-confusion of grain accounts.

The combination of establishing systems and mass supervision is one of the important reasons why the Nanben Management Area manages and uses grain well and reduces spillage and waste. The management area and the production teams jointly formulated grain management and consumption systems, and the management area cadres regularly went to the teams, entered the warehouses and canteens to check the grain management and consumption situation, and promptly solved any problems found. The broad masses of commune members also automatically participated in and supervised the management of grain, and planned to save grain. They said: This is everyone's business, and we cannot rely solely on the cadres. The second team harvested more than 4,000 catties of corn, which was piled up on the canteen building without being turned over and dried in time. Commune member Li Faxing said to the captain: Corn is more difficult to dry than rice, so we must turn it over and dry it quickly, otherwise it will mold if piled up for too long. The captain immediately arranged for six and a half laborers to thresh and dry the corn at the same time, so that the corn was not damaged.

    交代政策  建立制度  明确责任  过秤入仓
    南本管理区依靠群众分仓管好粮食
    本报讯　云南临沧县城区公社南本管理区（基本核算单位）党支部充分发动和依靠群众，收好、分好、管好、用好大春粮食。
    南本管理区党支部把管好粮食，作为分好和用好粮食、安排好社员生活、保证明年生产持续跃进的一项重要措施来抓。他们认为做好这一工作的关键，在于认真执行政策，加强思想教育，使收好、分好、管好、用好粮食变成群众的自觉行动。因此，在秋收开始前后，党支部反复向群众讲解有关粮食分配和保管政策，启发群众回忆对比解放前后的吃粮情况，对群众进行国家、集体、个人三者利益兼顾和管好粮食、节约用粮的教育。在执行政策当中，着重宣传了四点：一、生产队必须完成管理区统一分配的包产任务，把集中保管的粮食管理起来，这样才能实现“两保证”（保证完成交公粮售余粮任务和留足口粮、籽种、饲料）、“三兼顾”（国家、集体、社员三者利益兼顾）；二、管理区按标准留足社员的口粮和各队必需的籽种、饲料，由各队分仓保管；三、管理区坚决执行超产奖励政策，超产得奖的粮食归生产队，管理区绝不调用；四、在保证完成包产任务的前提下，各队利用田边地角零星土地扩种的小杂粮主要归队所有。经过反复宣传，做到政策深入人心，家喻户晓。这时，管理区向群众公布了粮食生产情况，发动社员讨论制定出粮食分配方案，根据统筹兼顾、全面安排、瞻前顾后、留有余地的原则，一一落实了公余粮、口粮、籽种、饲料、储备粮，做到大家心中都有底。由于粮食分配政策落实兑现，调动了广大群众收好、分好、管好、用好粮食的积极性。
    坚持过秤入仓，实事求是地掌握粮食底子，是这个管理区保证分好、管好粮食的重要一环。秋收一开始，粮食共管委员会就根据社员代表会通过的粮食分配方案，领导社员边收边分。不论是留作公粮或分给各队的口粮、籽种、饲料，一律坚持过秤入仓，填发入库三联单，做到“三对口”，就是收上场的粮食与仓库对口；粮食总数与仓库对口；保管员、生产队和管理区三方的账目对口。由于坚持边收边分，过秤入仓，分配政策彻底兑现，进一步调动了群众的积极性，各队都坚持当天收的粮食当天过秤入仓，堵塞了抛撒损失漏洞。第七队钟常妹作业组，有一日到收工的时候了，田里还有三挑谷子未挑回来，有的社员主张第二天再去挑，钟常妹说：要不得，我们要把粮食收好管好不损失，才能保证完成共管任务，实现“两保证”，队上也才会有超产粮。经她这样一讲，当即就有两个社员，自动跟她去把粮食挑回来，过秤入仓。各队在边收边分、过秤入仓时，都有管理区粮食管理委员会、生产队粮食管理小组的成员和粮食保管员三方面的人在场，分类上账，这样就做到收完分完，五种留粮全部过秤落实入仓。
    在入仓当中，各队都坚持专粮专仓，固定专人负责保管。例如，第六队有八间仓，固定一间暂时保管公粮余粮；固定四间装口粮；一间装籽种；其余两间分别装饲料和储备粮。仓库编了号，固定给八个积极负责的社员保管，做到“三不乱”，即粮食品种不混乱，不同用途的粮食不混乱，粮食账目不混乱。
    建立制度与群众监督相结合，是南本管理区管好、用好粮食和减少抛撒浪费的重要原因之一。管理区与生产队共同订立了管粮、用粮制度，管理区干部还定期深入到队，进仓库、上食堂检查管粮、用粮情况，发现问题，及时解决。广大社员也自动参加和监督管好粮食，计划节约用粮，他们说：这是大家的事，不能单靠干部。第二队收了四千多斤包谷，堆在食堂楼上，未及时翻晒，社员李发兴就对队长说：包谷比稻谷难干，要赶紧翻晒，堆长了就会发霉。队长马上安排六个半劳力，边脱粒、边晒，使包谷未受损失。
