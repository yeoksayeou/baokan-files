Xinhua News Agency, Anshan – Workers at the Anshan Iron and Steel (Anshan Iron and Steel) Power Plant, which has continuously won the Anshan Iron and Steel inter-factory competition safety production red flag, have entered December and are insisting on carrying out safety inspections on all equipment item by item every day, solidly doing a good job in safety work, and timely preventing possible accidents, strongly supporting steel production.

The power plant is one of the main units of Anshan Iron and Steel's power system. The plant's Party committee regards safe power supply as the most important central task for all employees. In addition to regularly conducting ideological education on safe production for all employees, it also appointed Deputy Director Tang Demian to specifically focus on safe power supply. Entering December, on the basis of continuous safe power supply for eleven consecutive months, the Party committee further mobilized employees to launch discussions on continuous safe power supply, implemented safety measures to every workshop, every piece of equipment, and every person, so that everyone consciously strengthened safety work.

This plant pays special attention to strengthening daily equipment maintenance and repair work. The maintenance section responsible for line maintenance recently mobilized all members of the section to conduct a comprehensive inspection of all lines, conducted safety assessments for each line, solved problems that needed to be solved at the time on the spot, and included problems and weak links that needed to be solved in the future in the maintenance plan, and assigned dedicated personnel to solve them regularly. In order to enable everyone to skillfully master the equipment they are responsible for and eliminate operational accidents, the power supply section also organized a performance competition to implement safety regulations, which improved the technical operating level of the entire section.

While strengthening equipment maintenance and repairs, the power plant also concentrated its efforts on the maintenance of key power supply equipment and lines supplying Anshan Iron and Steel's open-hearth furnaces and blast furnaces. On these lines, from 0:00 to 24:00 every day, dedicated personnel are responsible for inspecting and maintaining them section by section, preventing all accidents.

The Anshan Iron and Steel Power Plant also anticipated the unfavorable conditions that the winter climate might bring to equipment maintenance and took timely measures. Since most of the equipment in each substation is located outdoors, metallic dust in the air can easily accumulate on the surface. When it comes into contact with the melting snow in early winter, it will cause a "grounding" phenomenon and burn out the equipment. In light of this situation, as early as November, the plant organized a large number of personnel to conduct a major inspection and cleaning of all substation equipment, rushed to deal with a large number of equipment defects, and established a regular cleaning system, assigning dedicated personnel to be responsible, preventing possible accidents after snowfall.

### 安全供电保证炼钢  鞍钢供电厂职工扎扎实实做好安全工作

    安全供电保证炼钢
    鞍钢供电厂职工扎扎实实做好安全工作
    新华社鞍山电　曾连续获得鞍钢厂际竞赛安全生产红旗的鞍钢供电厂职工，进入12月份，每天都坚持逐项逐件地对所有设备进行安全检查，扎扎实实做好安全工作，及时防止了可能发生的事故，有力地支援了钢铁生产。
    供电厂是鞍钢动力系统主要单位之一，厂党委把安全供电看做是全厂职工最重要的中心任务，除了经常向全体职工进行安全生产的思想教育以外，并指定副厂长汤德绵专门抓安全供电。进入12月，党委在连续十一个月安全供电的基础上，又进一步发动职工对持续安全供电展开讨论，把安全措施落实到每个车间、每项设备和每个人身上，使人人自觉地加强了安全工作。
    这个厂特别注意加强日常设备维护检修工作。负责线路维护的检修工段，最近发动全段职工，对所有线路进行了一次全面大检查，对每一条线路都做了安全鉴定，需要当时解决的问题，就地解决，需要以后解决的问题和薄弱环节，就纳入检修计划，定期定专人进行解决。为了使每个人都能熟练地掌握自己所负责的设备，消灭操作事故，供电工段还组织了贯彻安全规程的表演赛，使全工段都提高了技术操作水平。
    在加强设备维护检修的同时，供电厂还集中力量抓供给鞍钢各平炉、高炉的重点供电设备和线路的维修。在这些线路上每天从零点到二十四点，都有专人负责，逐段进行检查、维护，防止了一切事故。
    鞍钢供电厂还估计到冬季气候可能给设备维修带来的不利条件，及时地采取了措施。由于各变电所的绝大部分设备都设在室外，空气中的金属灰尘很容易堆积在表面上，它们和初冬的融雪接触时，就会发生“接地”现象，把设备烧坏。根据这一情况，这个厂早在11月份就组织了大批力量对所有变电所设备进行大检查、大清扫，突击处理了大量设备缺陷，并且建立了定期清扫制度，指定专人负责，防止了降雪后可能带来的事故。
