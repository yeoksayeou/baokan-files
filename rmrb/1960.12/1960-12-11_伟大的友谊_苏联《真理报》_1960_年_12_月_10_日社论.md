Great Friendship
Soviet "Pravda" Editorial, December 10, 1960

Yesterday, the Soviet people warmly saw off the Chinese Party and Government Delegation headed by Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China and Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the ChineseCommunist Party, to return home. The Chinese Party and Government Delegation celebrated the 43rd anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution with us on Soviet soil. It participated in the historic meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries.

The visit of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation to the Soviet Union vividly demonstrates the unbreakable friendship between the Soviet Union and China. The warm and sincere meetings in Moscow, Leningrad, Minsk, Omsk, and Irkutsk eloquently illustrate this.

Unprecedented mutual relations in human history have been formed between countries of the world socialist system. The basis of this relationship is the principles of complete equality, comprehensive economic, political, and cultural cooperation, mutual benefit and fraternal mutual assistance, and the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. As pointed out in the declaration of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries, the socialist camp is a social, economic, and political association of free and sovereign peoples united by close socialist international solidarity and a unity of common interests and goals, advancing along the path of socialism and communism. Socialism organically combines the development of its own economy, culture, and national system with the interests of strengthening and developing the entire world socialist system, and with the increasing unity of all nations. The political and moral unity of the people of the socialist camp arises on this basis and is constantly consolidated on this basis. The unbreakable friendship between the great peoples of the Soviet Union and China is also constantly strengthened and developed on this basis.

The declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries made a profound theoretical argument on the law of development of the fraternal friendship of the peoples of the socialist camp. This historic document states that one of the greatest achievements of the world socialist system is that it has proven in practice the Marxist-Leninist principle that national antagonism disappears with the disappearance of class antagonism. Antagonistic contradictions between classes and classes, nations and nations, and countries and countries, which lead to military conflicts, are inherent in the capitalist system. Contrary to the laws of the capitalist system, the socialist system essentially has no objective reasons that can cause contradictions and conflicts between the people and countries of this system. The development of this system makes all countries and nations more and more united, and strengthens the various forms of cooperation between them.

Comrade Khrushchev pointed out: "Soviet-Chinese friendship is in the fundamental interests of our two countries and the entire socialist camp, and in the interests of world peace. The unbreakable fraternal friendship between the people of our two great countries and the people of all countries of the entire socialist camp is an unbreakable fortress of peace and the security of all peoples, and a guarantee of the future victory of socialism and communism."

The Chinese often say that friendship with the Soviet people is as strong and unbreakable as the Himalayas, as deep as the Pacific Ocean, and as vast as the Yangtze River and the Volga River. Comrade Mao Zedong emphasized: "Consolidating unity with the Soviet Union and consolidating unity with all socialist countries is our basic policy and where our basic interests lie."

The Soviet and Chinese people have a common goal—to guarantee peace and build communism; they have common interests—the happiness and well-being of the working people; and they have a common solid foundation—Marxism-Leninism.

Our friendship enhances the giant-like strength of the people of the two countries. This friendship is expressed in economic mutual assistance, cultural exchanges, joint research by scientists, and exchange of production, technology, and scientific experience. This friendship is expressed every day in thousands of large and small matters.

Chinese friends are happy for the achievements of the Soviet people, who, led by their Communist Party and its Leninist Central Committee headed by Comrade Khrushchev, are enthusiastically building a material and technological foundation for communism. And we Soviet people are also happy for the outstanding achievements of our Chinese brothers, who, under the leadership of their Communist Party and its Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, are victoriously implementing socialist construction plans.

The significance of Soviet-Chinese friendship is enormous. It not only plays an increasingly important role in the lives of the two countries and the entire socialist camp. It also has a positive impact on the development of international events, and it helps to improve the international situation. The Soviet Union, People's China, and all socialist countries steadfastly and consistently pursue a policy of peaceful coexistence and resolutely defend world peace.

The government of People's China agrees with and supports the Soviet Union's proposals on complete and thorough disarmament and on the prohibition of the production, use, and testing of nuclear weapons. The Soviet and Chinese peoples are united in supporting the national liberation movement unfolding with great force in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and in the struggle against colonialism.

Not long ago, Comrade Liu Shaoqi emphasized at the mass rally of the working people of Moscow that the Chinese people would like to thank Comrade Khrushchev, head of the Soviet government, because at the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly, he firmly advocated the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations and sternly refuted the shameless slander made by the United States against China.

The Soviet Union and China vigilantly defend world peace. They have more than once jointly worked to block the path of war that the international imperialist aggressive forces attempted to launch. This is clearly not in the interests of our common enemies, who have spent a lot of effort trying to sow seeds of distrust between the great peoples of the two countries and weaken our unity. This is a waste of effort! No force in the world can shake the unbreakable friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China!

Our friendship—the friendship between the Soviet Union and China, the friendship between the people of all socialist countries—will continue to be strengthened in the future. It is a model of true fraternal relations, an example of unity in the struggle to achieve common goals, to achieve a bright future for all mankind, and to achieve world peace.

    伟大的友谊
    苏联《真理报》1960年12月10日社论
    昨天，苏联人热情地欢送以中华人民共和国主席、中国共产党中央委员会副主席刘少奇同志为首的中国党政代表团团员回国。中国党政代表团同我们一起在苏联的国土上庆祝了伟大的十月社会主义革命43周年。它参加了具有历史意义的各国共产党和工人党代表会议。
    中国党政代表团对苏联的访问鲜明地表明苏中两国牢不可破的友谊。在莫斯科、列宁格勒、明斯克、鄂木斯克和伊尔库次克的热烈而诚挚的会见就雄辩地说明了这一点。
    世界社会主义体系各国间形成了人类历史上前所未有的相互关系。这种关系的基础是完全平等、全面的经济、政治和文化合作、互利和兄弟般的相互援助的原则，是马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则。正像各国共产党和工人党代表会议的声明所指出的，社会主义阵营是由紧密的社会主义国际团结以及共同利益和目的的一致所联合起来的、沿着社会主义和共产主义道路前进的、自由而享有主权的各国人民在社会、经济和政治方面的结合。社会主义把本国的经济、文化、国家体制的发展，同整个世界社会主义体系的加强和发展的利益，同各民族的日益团结，有机地结合在一起。社会主义阵营各国人民在政治道义上的一致，就是在这个基础上产生的，并且在这个基础上不断巩固。苏中两国伟大人民的牢不可破的友谊也是在这个基础上不断加强和发展的。
    在各国共产党和工人党的声明中，对社会主义阵营各国人民兄弟友谊的发展规律作了深刻的理论性论证。在这个历史性文件中说，世界社会主义体系的最伟大的成就之一，是它在实践中证明了马克思列宁主义关于民族对抗随着阶级对抗的消失而消失的原理。阶级和阶级、民族和民族、国家和国家之间的对抗性的、导致军事冲突的矛盾是资本主义制度所固有的。同资本主义制度的规律相反，社会主义体系在本质上没有能使这个体系的人民间和国家间发生矛盾和冲突的客观原因。这个体系的发展，使各国和各民族越来越团结，使它们之间的合作的各种形式越来越巩固。
    赫鲁晓夫同志指出：“苏中友谊符合我们两国、整个社会主义阵营的根本利益，符合世界和平事业的利益。我们两个伟大国家人民、整个社会主义阵营各国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊，是和平和各国人民安全的牢不可破的堡垒，是社会主义、共产主义未来胜利的保证。”
    中国人常说，同苏联人民的友谊像喜马拉雅山一样的坚固和牢不可破，像太平洋一样的深，像长江和伏尔加河一样辽阔无际。毛泽东同志着重指出：“巩固同苏联的团结，巩固同一切社会主义国家的团结，这是我们的基本方针，基本利益所在。”
    苏联和中国人民有着共同的目标——保证和平和建设共产主义，有着共同的利益——劳动人民的幸福和福利，有着共同的坚实基础——马克思列宁主义。
    我们的友谊增强着两国人民的巨人般的力量。这种友谊表现在经济互助、文化交流、科学家的共同研究和交流生产、技术和科学经验中。这种友谊每天都表现在成千上万的大小事情中。
    中国朋友们为苏联人民的成就感到高兴，苏联人民在自己的共产党及其以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的列宁主义中央委员会的领导下，热情地建立着共产主义的物质技术基础。而我们苏联人也为中国兄弟们的卓越成就感到高兴，中国兄弟们在自己的共产党及其以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会的领导下，胜利地实现着社会主义建设计划。
    苏中友谊的意义是巨大的。它不仅仅在两国和整个社会主义阵营的生活中起着越来越大的作用。它对国际事态的发展也有着良好的影响，它有助于国际局势的健康化。苏联、人民中国和所有社会主义国家坚定而一贯地执行着和平共处政策，坚决地保卫着世界和平。
    人民中国政府赞同并支持苏联关于全面彻底裁军、关于禁止生产、使用和试验核武器的建议。苏中两国人民在支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲以巨大的力量展开的民族解放运动方面和在反对殖民主义的斗争中是一致的。
    不久前，刘少奇同志在莫斯科劳动人民群众大会上特别强调指出，中国人民要感谢苏联政府首脑赫鲁晓夫同志，因为他在第十五届联合国大会上，坚决地主张恢复中国在联合国的合法权利，严正地驳斥了美国对于中国所作的无耻的污蔑。
    苏联和中国警惕地捍卫着世界和平。它们不止一次地共同努力堵塞了国际帝国主义侵略势力企图发动的战争的道路。这显然不合我们的共同敌人的心意，他们花了不少力气，企图在两国伟大人民之间散布不信任的种子和削弱我们的团结一致。这是枉费心机的！世界上没有任何力量能够动摇苏中两国人民的牢不可破的友谊！
    我们的友谊——苏联同中国的友谊，所有社会主义国家人民的友谊，今后仍将不断加强。它是真正兄弟关系的典范，是在争取达到共同目标、争取全人类光辉未来、争取世界和平的斗争中团结一致的范例。
