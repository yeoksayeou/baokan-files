    Shenyang Mechanical Industry Steelmaking Furnaces Simultaneously Increase Production
    Cooperating with Specialized Steel Plants to Produce More and Better Steel
    (Our dispatch from Shenyang, December 7th) The Shenyang city mechanical industry sector is actively making steel. The average daily steel production of various factories increased sharply by 26.8% in October compared to September, and has increased by more than 20% since November compared to October. The continuous increase in steel production has provided a more ample guarantee for the cast steel needed for manufacturing mechanical equipment in various factories, and orders for key equipment have been completed ahead of schedule. The city's steel production has also increased rapidly.
    Many mechanical factories in Shenyang have electric furnaces, converters, or open-hearth furnaces for producing cast steel. In addition to supplying their own enterprises, a portion of the steel produced is also supplied to fraternal enterprises. The total cast steel production of various mechanical factories accounts for about 80% of the city's total steel production. The steelmaking production of these enterprises is not only related to the completion of their own equipment production plans, but also to the realization of the city's steel production plan. Since September, while vigorously grasping the production of specialized steel plants, the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has also vigorously grasped the steelmaking production of the mechanical industry. Mechanical factories with steelmaking equipment have generally established steelmaking headquarters or leading groups headed by the party committee secretary or factory director, and have transferred cadres and workers to strengthen the front line of steelmaking. Leading cadres at all levels have gone deep into the steelmaking furnace, and together with the workers, they have formulated and implemented various effective measures. Leading cadres at all levels of the Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant have adopted the method of "fixed point settlement," dividing up areas of responsibility, and vigorously grasping the work of groups, achieving political and technical work together in front of the furnace. Steel production in October increased by 25.4% compared to September, and continued to increase in November. Leading cadres at all levels of the Shenyang Metallurgical Machinery Repair and Manufacturing Plant worked together with workers and summarized the experience of advanced groups, establishing model workers and inserting red flags throughout the plant. The entire plant completed its annual steel production plan two months ahead of schedule.
    The workers of various mechanical factories vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution, and actively promoted various effective advanced steelmaking experiences. The steelmaking workers of the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, in response to the key production problem of high sulfur content and long smelting time of local iron, after hard research, created a set of advanced experiences in fluxing, desulfurization, and rapid steelmaking, shortening the steelmaking time of each electric furnace from 2 hours and 50 minutes to 2 hours; at the same time, they created an advanced method of rapid furnace repair, shortening the furnace repair time from 10 hours to 2 hours. After learning the rapid steelmaking experience of the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, the workers of the electric furnace workshop of the Shenyang General Machinery Plant, under the leadership of the workshop party branch, held a "three-in-one" research meeting, integrating the learned experience with the plant's existing eleven experiences to create a new record of making one furnace of steel in 1 hour and 36 minutes. When many units rushed to catch up, the steelmaking workers of the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant seriously learned from the experience of fraternal units and created a new record of making one furnace of steel in 1 hour and 22 minutes.
    In order to fully utilize the waste steel within the plant, the mechanical factories in Shenyang City launched a mass campaign to excavate waste steel. Through methods such as digging, checking, and searching, the workers of the Shenyang Transformer Factory recovered more than 740 tons of waste steel in a short period of time. Due to the mechanical industry's large-scale excavation of steelmaking potential, the city's steel production has also increased significantly. The city's average daily steel production in October increased by 24.9% compared to September, and increased by 14.7% in the first twenty days of November compared to October. Seven enterprises in the city have already completed their annual steel production plans ahead of schedule.
    The increase in steel production in various mechanical factories has promoted the leap forward in equipment production. After vigorously grasping steelmaking production, the Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant increased the output of freight car cast steel parts by 49% compared to the past, and the scrap rate of cast steel parts was also reduced. The plant's annual production plan for manufacturing new freight cars and repairing locomotives has been completed ahead of schedule. Due to the full utilization of waste steel within the plant, the steel utilization rate has been increased, and product costs have also been reduced.

    沈阳机械工业炼钢炉齐闹增产
    配合专业钢铁厂多产钢产好钢
    本报沈阳7日电　沈阳市机械工业部门积极炼钢。各厂钢的平均日产量，10月比9月猛增26.8％，11月份以来又比10月份增加20％以上。钢产量不断增加，使各厂制造机械设备的铸钢有了更充分的保证，重点设备订货计划纷纷提前完成。全市钢产量也迅速提高。
    沈阳市许多机械工厂都有生产铸钢的电炉、转炉或平炉。生产的钢除供应本企业以外，有一部分还供应兄弟企业。各机械厂铸钢总产量约占全市钢产量的80％左右。这些企业的炼钢生产，不仅关系到完成本厂设备生产计划，也关系到全市产钢计划的实现。9月份以来，中共沈阳市委在大抓专业钢铁厂生产的同时，狠抓机械工业的炼钢生产。有炼钢设备的各机械厂普遍建立了由党委书记或厂长挂帅的炼钢指挥部或领导小组，抽调干部和工人充实了炼钢第一线。各级领导干部纷纷深入炼钢炉旁，同工人一起制订和贯彻各种有效措施。沈阳机车车辆厂各级领导干部，采取“定点落户”的办法，分片包干，狠抓小组工作，做到了政治、技术一齐上炉前，10月份钢产量比9月提高了25.4％，11月份又步步提高。沈阳冶金机械修造厂各级领导干部同工人一起劳动，并总结先进小组的经验，在全厂大树标兵，大插红旗。全厂提前两个月完成了全年产钢计划。
    各机械厂职工大搞技术革新和技术革命，积极推广各种行之有效的先进炼钢经验。沈阳重型机器厂炼钢职工针对土铁硫高，熔炼时间长的生产关键，经过艰苦钻研，创造出助熔、脱硫、快速炼钢等方面的一套先进经验，使电炉每炉炼钢时间由过去的两点五十分钟缩短到两点钟；同时创造了快速修炉的先进操作方法，使修炉时间由过去的十小时缩短到两小时。沈阳通用机械厂电炉车间职工学习沈阳重型机器厂快速炼钢经验以后，在车间党支部领导下，召开“三结合”研究会，把学到的经验同本厂已有的十一项经验配套成龙，进一步创造了一点三十六分钟炼一炉钢的新纪录。当许多单位纷纷赶上来以后，沈阳重型机器厂的炼钢工人又认真学习兄弟单位的经验，创造了一点二十二分钟炼一炉钢的新纪录。
    沈阳市各机械厂为了充分利用厂内的废钢铁，开展了群众性的挖掘废钢铁的活动。沈阳变压器厂职工通过挖、查、找等办法，短时间内就回收废钢铁七百四十多吨。由于机械工业大挖炼钢潜力，全市钢产量也显著提高。10月份全市钢的平均日产量比9月份提高了24.9％，11月份头二十天又比10月份提高了14.7％。全市已有七个企业提前完成了全年产钢计划。
    各机械厂钢产量增加，促进了设备生产的跃进。沈阳机车车辆厂狠抓炼钢生产以后，全厂货车铸钢件产量比过去猛增49％，铸钢件废品率也降低了。全厂新造货车和机车修造的全年生产计划已经提前完成。各厂由于充分利用厂内的废钢铁，提高了钢铁利用率，产品成本也有所降低。
