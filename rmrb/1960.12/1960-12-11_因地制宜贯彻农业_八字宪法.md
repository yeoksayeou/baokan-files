Implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for Agriculture According to Local Conditions
Dong Yukun, First Secretary of the CPC Siping Prefectural Committee

The Siping Prefecture of Jilin Province is located in the heart of the Songliao Plain and is one of the main grain-producing areas of Jilin Province. It is rich in crops such as soybeans, corn, sorghum, and millet. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Jilin Provincial Party Committee, agricultural production has greatly developed. In 1959, the total agricultural output value increased by 76.3% compared with 1949. Since 1958, a new situation of continuous leap forward has emerged in agricultural production. In the three years of the Great Leap Forward, we suffered major natural disasters every year. In 1958, we encountered the worst drought in a century; in 1959, there was spring drought and autumn flooding, which brought great difficulties to spring plowing and summer hoeing; in the spring and summer of 1960, insect plagues spread everywhere, and continuous rain severely threatened summer hoeing and weeding. In the face of such severe natural disasters, the people of the entire prefecture, under the leadership of the Party, held high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and carried out a tenacious and continuous struggle against natural disasters, greatly reducing the harm caused by natural disasters and achieving relatively good harvests. Over the past three years, Party organizations at all levels and the broad masses of the people, in the process of fighting against natural disasters, have further understood some of the characteristics and laws of developing agricultural production in Siping Prefecture, and based on these characteristics and laws, have repeatedly explored and studied the ways to increase agricultural production in our prefecture, thereby further bringing into play the subjective initiative of the people. What are the characteristics of Siping Prefecture? First, due to the historically large land area and small population, cultivation has always been relatively extensive, especially in terms of fertilizer. In the past, there was an old habit of applying fertilizer once every three years. Although the area fertilized and the amount of fertilizer applied have increased year by year since liberation, as of this year, about 20% of the cultivated land has still not been fertilized. There are also many problems with the quality of fertilizer and the methods of accumulating, transporting, and applying fertilizer. Second, the frost-free period is short. The frost-free period in Siping Prefecture is only about 135 days each year (the growing period of general crops is about 140 days). Therefore, until now, crops are basically planted only once a year. Moreover, the entire prefecture has historically been characterized by spring drought, summer flooding, and early autumn frost, which brings many difficulties to spring plowing, summer hoeing, and crop growth. Third, there is a large land area and a small population, and there is a serious shortage of labor. The average rural area per person in the prefecture is more than 8.5 mu, and each laborer bears more than 23.8 mu of cultivated land, and agricultural work is concentrated. Both labor and animal power feel extraordinarily strained.

Based on the above characteristics of Siping Prefecture, in recent years, on the basis of conscientiously and comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, we have focused on the three measures of fertilizer, early planting, and skillful management.

In grasping fertilizer, we started from two aspects. First, we solved the ideological problem of fertilizer work, that is, overcoming the remaining thoughts of underestimating fertilizer application. Since the Great Leap Forward, we have continuously adopted methods such as carrying out mass democratic discussions from top to bottom to improve the correct understanding of fertilizer application among the broad masses of cadres and the people, and formulated a fertilizer work plan. Second, in terms of technical measures, in addition to comprehensively grasping the five links of accumulating fertilizer, making fertilizer, preserving fertilizer, transporting fertilizer, and applying fertilizer rationally, we also focused on carrying out the "three major revolutions" of fertilizer work, that is, vigorously engaging in field fertilizer accumulation, vigorously engaging in pen manure, and vigorously engaging in warm manure piles in winter. Vigorously engaging in field fertilizer accumulation is a revolutionary measure to ensure more fertilizer application. According to typical surveys, the amount of labor used for accumulating and transporting fertilizer accounts for more than 30% of the total agricultural labor in the year. In the Chengren Brigade of the Lishu Commune in Liaoyuan City, it takes 15 workdays to accumulate one hectare of fertilizer, and 17 workdays to transport the fertilizer. In the past, wild soil was pulled to the village to pad the pens, and then transported to the fields, which wasted a lot of labor and animal power in round-trip transportation. How to reduce the labor force for transporting fertilizer is the first problem that should be solved in order to increase the amount of manure fertilizer in the future. After full deliberation, we proposed vigorously engaging in field fertilizer accumulation, which was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the people. In addition, livestock pens and composting pits with suitable conditions are built in the fields and on the slopes. After doing this, according to preliminary calculations, the labor for transporting fertilizer can be reduced by one-third next year, opening up a new way for more fertilizer application.

Vigorously engaging in pen manure and green manure composting, rationally utilizing fertilizer sources, and improving fertilizer quality are the second revolution in fertilizer work. About one-third of our entire prefecture has the habit of padding livestock pens, and most places do not pad livestock pens, so there is less accumulated fertilizer and the fertilizer effect is low. In order to improve fertilizer quality, all localities actively eliminate soil fertilizer, vigorously engage in large livestock and pig pen fertilizer accumulation, and vigorously grasp green manure composting. Vigorously engaging in winter warm manure piles is mainly for preserving fertilizer. In late autumn and early winter, the accumulated fertilizer is finely turned over and piled into large piles, with an insulation layer added to allow the fertilizer soil to dissolve, ferment, and decompose, thereby greatly enhancing the fertility.

Through the above series of work, the fertilizer work of the entire prefecture has achieved remarkable achievements, creating material conditions for further increasing grain production.

While vigorously grasping fertilizer, we also grasped timely early planting according to the characteristics of the short frost-free period in Siping Prefecture, and focused on early action in various aspects around early planting. Grasping early is firstly to win time to fight against nature, and with time, we have the initiative; secondly, to alleviate the tension of insufficient labor during the busy agricultural season. Last year, due to timely early planting, crops increased their growing period by more than half a month, ensuring that 150,000 hectares of late-maturing crops were protected from frost damage. In 1960, from grasping timely early planting in the past, it developed into grasping early in a series of agricultural seasons, thereby greatly reducing the harm of insect plagues and waterlogging. The essence of grasping early is to guide agricultural production with the thought of continuous revolution. A series of agricultural activities such as early sowing, early weeding, early harvesting, and early threshing are better early than late at the appropriate time, which has been recognized by the broad masses of cadres and the people. However, there are also two different kinds of early in actual action. One is that the previous stage has not prepared for the later stage. Although it also starts early when the time comes, it is slow and clumsy, resulting in "more haste, less speed." The other is early with planning and preparation. Everything is prepared and arranged early, and when the opportunity comes, the superior forces are concentrated to fight a war of annihilation. Our experience is that only early with planning can truly achieve the purpose of early. Starting from the theory of the stages of revolutionary development, we divide the year's agricultural production into five strategic stages, namely: preparation for farming, spring plowing, summer hoeing, later field management, and autumn harvest. According to the principle of having battles, having rest, having labor, and having leisure, each strategic stage is divided into several battles, with phased assaults and appropriate rest. Because of grasping early, it is also possible to cleverly arrange agricultural work, look at the next step while walking, and rush forward in everything, thereby alleviating the concentration of agricultural work and the tension of labor; it also creates conditions for realizing the early accumulation, early start, and early delivery proposed in fertilizer work.

Grasping hard and skillfully not only greatly alleviated the difficulty of insufficient labor, but also created conditions for further developing agricultural productive forces. Skillful management, in addition to cleverly arranging time, agricultural work, labor, and animal power, the most important thing is to vigorously engage in agricultural tool reform. The achievements of the mass agricultural tool reform movement in our prefecture in 1960 are enormous. The main characteristics are that it has developed from single-piece reform in the past to complete-set reform; from agricultural tool reform to comprehensive reform of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, fishery, and logistics tools. This year, a total of 142 kinds of agricultural tools have been reformed in the entire prefecture, with more than 193,000 pieces. Due to the reform of agricultural tools, about 15.76 million workdays have been saved, greatly alleviating the contradiction of insufficient labor. The remarkable achievements made in agricultural tool reform have further educated and encouraged the broad masses of the people, making them more determined to take the road of agricultural mechanization, and have made the necessary preparations for the comprehensive realization of agricultural mechanization. For example, the Fanjiatun People's Commune in HuaiDe County has created and modified more than 40 kinds of tractor-drawn agricultural implements. There are already 654 standard tractors in the entire prefecture, and 27 communes and 23 management areas have begun to use mechanized operations on some land. In addition to ensuring that the existing agricultural machinery is used well, managed well, and its mechanical efficiency is fully utilized, we are also creating various conditions and training technical forces to welcome the arrival of comprehensive mechanization, so that agriculture can gradually move towards the direction of modernization.

We resolutely use the spirit of continuous revolution to make rural tools fully matched and systematic in the long run, so that it develops towards systematization. Past practical experience has proved that the finalization and matching of improved tools must be grasped early and practically. All tools that are widely promoted should be carried out one season in advance to be sure. We are now starting to grasp the finalization and manufacturing of tillage tools for next spring to ensure the needs of tillage next spring.

Rural tool reform is not only a matter for farmers themselves, but also requires the support of all walks of life. In order to better realize industrial support for agriculture, the entire prefecture takes the three cities of Siping, Liaoyuan, and Gongzhuling as the backbone, divides the seven cities and counties into three cooperation areas, and implements factory-commune linkage to vigorously support agriculture. The commune agricultural machinery factory has now been initially built, increasing the commune's ability to regenerate itself, and has and will play a huge role in accelerating agricultural technological transformation.

Practice has proved that the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture is a universal law for increasing agricultural production, and no one of its contents can be absolutized. However, in the actual work of comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture in recent years, we have also deeply felt that universal laws must be combined with specific conditions. The reason why we focused on the three measures of fertilizer, early planting, and skillful management is because in Siping Prefecture, fertilizer has always been the weak link in increasing grain production. Solving the fertilizer problem must also be considered in conjunction with solving the problem of insufficient labor on the agricultural front. Therefore, while vigorously grasping fertilizer, we also firmly grasped the two measures of early planting and skillful management. Early planting and skillful management are not only measures to increase production, but also measures to solve the problem of insufficient labor. Without increasing agricultural labor, we mainly guarantee the realization of the production increase plan through the measures of early planting and skillful management.

Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Jilin Provincial Party Committee, we must unswervingly implement the policy of "taking agriculture as the foundation," fully utilize all favorable conditions, and ensure further increases in grain and soybean production, so as to make greater contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland.

    因地制宜贯彻农业“八字宪法”
    中共四平地委第一书记  董玉昆
    吉林省四平专区位于松辽平原的腹部，是吉林省主要产粮区之一。这里盛产大豆、玉米、高粱、谷子等农作物。解放以后，在党中央和吉林省委的领导下，农业生产有了很大发展，1959年农业总产值比1949年增长了76.3％。1958年以来，农业生产呈现出持续跃进的新形势。在大跃进的三年中，每年都遭受到较大的自然灾害。1958年遭遇到百年来未有过的大旱灾；1959年春旱秋涝，给春耕和夏锄带来了极大困难；1960年春夏，虫灾到处蔓延，阴雨连绵，严重地威胁着夏锄铲趟。在这样严重的自然灾害面前，全专区人民在党的领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，向自然灾害进行了顽强持续的斗争，大大减轻了自然灾害的危害程度，夺得了较好的收成。三年来，各级党的组织同广大人民群众，在与自然灾害斗争的过程中，进一步认识了在四平专区发展农业生产的一些特点和规律，并根据这些特点和规律，反复地摸索、研究了我们专区的农业增产的途径，从而进一步发挥了人的主观能动作用。四平专区的特点是什么呢？第一，由于历年来地多人少，耕作一贯比较粗放，尤其在肥料方面，过去有三年施一次肥的旧习惯。解放后施肥面积和施肥量，虽然逐年增加，但是到今年为止，仍有20％左右的耕地未施肥。在肥料质量和积、送、施肥方法上，也还存在不少问题。第二，无霜期短。四平专区每年的无霜期只有一百三十五天左右（一般农作物生长期为一百四十天左右）。因此，直到现在，基本上还是一年种一次庄稼。而且全专区历来还有春旱、夏涝、秋霜早的特点，给春耕、夏锄和作物生长，带来很多困难。第三，地多人少，劳动力严重不足。全区农村平均每人占有耕地八亩半以上，每个劳动力负担耕地二十三亩八分多，而且农活集中。劳力和畜力都感到异常紧张。
    根据四平专区的上述特点，几年来，我们在认真全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”的基础上，紧紧抓住了肥、早、巧三项措施。
    在抓肥料中，我们是从两方面着手的。首先解决对肥料工作的思想问题，即克服轻视施肥的思想残余。自从大跃进以来，我们不断地采取自上而下，开展群众性的民主讨论等方法，提高了广大干部和群众对施肥的正确认识，制定出肥料工作规划。其次是在技术措施方面，除了全面抓了积肥、造肥、保肥、送肥、合理施肥等五个环节外，还着重开展了肥料工作的“三大革命”，即大搞田间积肥，大搞圈肥，冬季大搞暖粪堆等。大搞田间积肥是保证多施肥的一项革命性措施。根据典型调查，积肥、运肥的用工量，占全年农业用工量的30％以上。辽源市梨树公社成仁大队积一公顷的肥料，用十五个工，而运肥料则用十七个工。过去将野土拉到屯里垫圈，然后再运到地里，往返运输浪费了许多劳力和畜力。如何减少运肥的劳动力，是今后增加粪肥数量首先应当解决的问题。经过充分酝酿，我们提出了大搞田间积肥，受到广大群众的热烈欢迎。另外把有条件的畜圈、沤肥坑建立在田间和山坡上，这样做了以后，据初步计算，明年可减少三分之一的运肥用工，为多施肥开辟了一条新的道路。
    大搞圈肥和沤绿肥，合理利用肥源，提高肥料质量，是肥料工作第二项革命。我们全专区约有三分之一的地方，有牲畜垫圈的习惯，大部地方牲畜不垫圈，因此积肥少肥效底。为了提高肥料质量，各地积极消灭土肥，大搞大牲畜和猪圈积肥，大抓沤绿肥。大搞冬季暖粪堆，主要是为了保肥。在秋末冬初，把积出的肥料倒细，并堆成大堆，加上保温层，使肥土溶合，醱酵和分解，从而大大增强了肥力。
    经过上述一系列工作，全专区的肥料工作，已经取得显著成就，为进一步增产粮食创造了物质条件。
    在大抓肥料的同时，我们根据四平专区无霜期短的特点，还抓了及时早种，并围绕早种抓各个环节的早动手。抓早，一是为了赢得与自然斗争的时间，有了时间，便有了主动权；一是为了缓和农忙季节劳动力不足的紧张程度。去年由于适时早种，使作物增加了半个多月的生育期，保证了十五万公顷晚熟作物免受霜害。1960年由过去抓适时早种，发展到在一系列农业季节上抓早，从而大大减少了虫灾和水涝的危害程度。抓早的实质，是以不断革命论的思想去指导农业生产。早播种、早铲趟、早收、早打场等一系列农事活动，适时的早都比晚好，这点已经被广大干部和群众所承认。但是，在实际行动中也有两种不同的早，一是前阶段没有为后阶段作好准备，到时候虽然也动手早，但是拖泥带水，手忙脚乱，结果是“欲速则不达”，另一种是有计划有准备的早，万事早准备早安排，等时机一到，就集中优势兵力打歼灭战。我们的体会是只有有计划的早，才能真正达到早的目的。从革命发展阶段论出发，我们将全年农业生产划分为五个战略阶段，即：备耕、春耕、夏锄、后期田间管理和秋收。根据有战斗、有休整，有劳有逸的原则，又把每个战略阶段分成若干战役，分段突击，适当休整。由于抓早，也做到了巧安排农活，走上步看下步，事事往前赶，从而缓和了农活集中和劳动力紧张的程度；也为实现肥料工作中提出的早积、早起、早送等创造了条件。
    狠抓巧干，不仅大大缓和了劳动力不足的困难，而且为进一步发展农业生产力创造了条件。巧干除了在时间、农活、劳力和畜力等方面巧安排以外，最重要的还是大搞农具改革。我们专区1960年群众性的农具改革运动的成绩是巨大的，主要特点是已经由过去单件改革发展到成套改革；从农业工具改革发展到林、牧、副、渔和后勤工具的全面改革，今年全区共改革农具一百四十二种，十九万三千多件。由于农具的改革大约节省一千五百七十六万多个工日，大大缓和了劳力不足的矛盾。农具改革所取得的显著成就，又进一步教育和鼓舞了广大群众，使他们更加坚定了走农业机械化道路的意志。并为全面实现农业机械化，做了必要的准备。例如，怀德县范家屯人民公社，已经创造与改制出四十多种机引农具。全专区已有六百五十四标准台拖拉机，有二十七个公社和二十三个管理区，开始在部分土地上利用机耕作业。我们除了保证把现有农业机械使好、管好，充分发挥机械效能外，并正在为迎接全面机械化的到来，创造各种条件，培养技术力量，使农业逐步向现代化的方向迈进。
    我们坚决以不断革命的精神，使农村工具全面配套成龙，使它向系统化方向发展。过去的实践经验证明，改良工具的定型配套工作必须抓早、抓实，凡大量推广的工具，应提前一季进行才有把握。我们现在已经着手抓明春整地工具的定型制造工作，以保证明春整地的需要。
    农村工具改革不只是农民自己的事情，还需要各行各业的支援。为了更好的实现工业对农业的支援，我们全专区以四平、辽源、公主岭三个城市为骨干，将七个市、县划为三个协作片，实行厂社挂钩，大力支援农业。现在已经初步建成了公社农业机械厂，增加了公社自力更生的能力，对于加速农业技术改造已经和将要起巨大作用。
    实践证明，农业“八字宪法”是农业增产的普遍规律，不能把其中任何一项内容绝对化。但是在几年来全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”的实际工作中，我们也深深感到，普遍规律必须与具体条件相结合。我们所以狠抓肥、早、巧三项措施，因为四平专区，肥料始终是增产粮食的薄弱环节。解决肥料问题，又必须同解决农业战线劳动力不足的问题统一起来考虑。因此我们在大抓肥料的同时，又紧紧抓住了早和巧两项措施。早和巧既是增产的措施，也是解决劳动力不足的措施。在没有增加农业劳动力的情况下，我们主要是通过早和巧的措施，保证了增产措施计划的实现。
    在党中央和吉林省委的正确领导下，我们要坚定不移地贯彻“以农业为基础”的方针，充分运用一切有利条件，保证粮、豆进一步增产，为祖国的社会主义建设事业，作出更大的贡献。
