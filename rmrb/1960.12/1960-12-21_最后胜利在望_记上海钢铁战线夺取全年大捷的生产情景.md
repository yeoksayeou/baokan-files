    Final Victory in Sight
    -- Recording the Production Scene of Shanghai's Steel Front Seizing All-Round Victory for the Year
    By Our Shanghai Correspondent
    As the year draws to a close, the banks of the Huangpu River are ablaze with furnace fires and dancing steel sparks. Shanghai's ten thousand steelworkers are launching a final all-out assault. To achieve an even greater victory in the nation's steel production for 1960, Shanghai's steelworkers have gloriously shouldered an even heavier steelmaking task, determined to make even more brilliant contributions!
    They are demanding steel from the severe cold, demanding steel from time! Entering December, new records have been reported one after another from the steelmaking furnaces, with many workshops achieving consistently high yields. The Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, the largest steel producer, has seen high production almost daily in its three converter workshops; the famous Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant's No. 2 Converter Workshop has even more impressive records, still leading the way. The city's daily steel production is rising steadily, reaching the highest levels since the beginning of this year. Victory is in sight, and the fruits of this year's steel leap forward are right before our eyes!

    Two Brothers Tie
    The labor emulation campaign to seize year-end victory is being carried out fiercely at the steelmaking furnaces. Especially between the two brothers, the No. 2 and No. 3 Converter Workshops of the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, the competition is particularly intense.
    On December 1st, at the plant-wide decisive battle mobilization meeting, the representative of the No. 2 Converter Workshop, which had won the red banner twice in a row, proposed: to use molten steel to cast the red banner onto their furnace. As soon as he finished speaking, Xu Xianglin, a worker from the No. 3 Converter Workshop, jumped onto the stage and said: "Our workshop has more than three thousand people, and we will seize the red banner and plant it on our furnace!"
    Indeed, a match of equals: In terms of equipment conditions, the two workshops are roughly the same; in terms of drive, both had overfulfilled their steelmaking plans ahead of schedule in November. However, the No. 2 Converter Workshop produced a few hundred tons more steel, taking a temporary lead. Now, both sides are determined to continue to compete, to see who contributes the most in the final decisive battle to complete the plant's annual plan.
    After the meeting, the workers of the No. 3 Converter Workshop took a breath and took the lead. In the first two days, December 1st and 2nd, they exceeded their opponents by more than one hundred tons of steel. Starting on the 3rd, the No. 2 Converter Workshop immediately chased hard, narrowing the gap to only a few dozen tons. Then, the No. 3 Converter Workshop took the lead again. Every shift, every hour, there was a possibility of being overtaken by the opponent. From the workshop's Party Branch Secretary and Director to the furnace workers and broadcasters, they constantly called to inquire about the other side's production. At mealtime, the "war report" was crowded with steelworkers, looking, discussing, and calculating how much steel they still had to produce today to maintain their advantage.
    On the 7th, the competition reached its most intense moment. Suddenly, the No. 4 and No. 5 pig iron furnaces in the No. 3 Converter Workshop malfunctioned. Immediately shut down the furnace? No! If the pig iron furnaces are running less, the molten iron supply to the converter will not be enough, and they will be overtaken by the opponent, affecting the plant's plan. In this tense moment, the workshop director and the Party Branch Secretary immediately went to the furnaces and discussed with the workers. The workers immediately took emergency measures: blocking the air and water leaks in the No. 4 and No. 5 furnaces, strengthening maintenance at all times, and holding on until the other two furnaces were repaired before shutting down the furnace! At the same time, they organized forces to rush to repair the other two furnaces. When the two furnaces were repaired, the No. 4 and No. 5 furnaces were still producing normally, ensuring the continued rise in workshop production. By the 9th, the No. 3 Converter Workshop still exceeded its opponents by more than one hundred tons. As long as they held on for one more day, they could achieve victory in the first ten days of the month.
    The workers of the No. 2 Converter Workshop were not willing to easily lose the red banner. On the last day, the 10th, they launched a fierce offensive. The workers of the upper, middle and lower shifts immediately snatched back more than one hundred tons of steel. At the end of the ten-day period, they had produced eight tons more steel than the No. 3 Converter Workshop!
    The two brothers basically tied.
    Unexpectedly, the No. 1 Converter Workshop "killed" from the side and took the red banner. It turned out that while the two workshops were chasing each other hotly, the workers of the No. 1 Converter Workshop were working hard silently for ten days. In a plant-wide comparison, the No. 1 Converter Workshop completed 37.39% of the entire month's plan in ten days, the highest.

    Discussions on the Production Front Line
    At the moment when the decisive battle was fiercely underway, the commanders of each factory and workshop went to the front line to discuss strategies for seizing victory with the workers.
    On the night of the 9th, a large truck was speeding from the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant to the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant on the highway. The people in the truck were discussing intensely. The Party Branch Secretary and the duty director of the No. 2 Converter Workshop of the No. 3 Plant and other leaders were seizing the time to discuss how to catch up with the No. 1 Plant. It turned out that the competition a few days ago between the No. 2 and No. 3 Converter Workshops of the No. 1 Plant had left their famous old red banner workshop behind. Now, they had just returned from the No. 1 Plant to learn from their experience. The discussion in the truck shifted from making determination and boosting morale to studying the advanced ideas and advanced experiences of the No. 1 Plant, and how to apply them to their own production. The cadres and workers of Class A studied the most seriously and discussed the most fiercely.
    The workers of the red banner workshop were truly bursting with energy. On the 12th, the workers of Class A were determined to create an amazing achievement: a shift output of 500 tons of steel, exceeding the target by 100 tons!
    Before the shift, the workshop deputy Party Branch Secretary, the foreman, the furnace chief, and the workers had discussions separately, analyzing the favorable and unfavorable conditions of the day, and determining the measures. After a brief discussion, the battle to climb the peak was launched in Class A. In the workshop, rows of converters swayed their huge bodies and roared, spitting flames and thick smoke, and the blowing time of each furnace was shorter than the last. The demand for molten iron increased hour by hour, and the workers of the pig iron furnaces used all their skills to continuously deliver molten iron to the converters.
    Half a shift had passed, and the workshop loudspeaker announced: "Four hours of steel production, 271 tons, a great victory has been achieved in the first half of the shift!" Yuan Honghai, the deputy Party Branch Secretary of the workshop, immediately summoned the duty director, the foreman of the pig iron furnace and converter sections to hold a mid-shift meeting in the broadcasting room in front of the furnace to study the battle for the next four hours.
    To the left of the broadcasting room were rows of converters, and opposite were rows of pig iron furnaces, and the battle was still in full swing. The mid-shift meeting was brief and powerful. Everyone unanimously agreed to raise the shift production plan from 500 tons to 560 tons. The broadcaster moved the microphone from the deputy Party Branch Secretary's mouth to the mouths of the duty director and the foremen. Immediately, the Party Branch Secretary's call, the duty director's battle plan, and the foremen's loud guarantees were broadcast in the workshop.
    The loudspeaker announced the foremen's guarantee to the deputy Party Branch Secretary: "Yes, we will definitely exceed 560 tons!" The workers in front of and behind the furnace were all excited and full of energy. The loudspeaker announced the foreman of the pig iron furnace's report to the deputy Party Branch Secretary: "The pig iron furnace is eating a lot, and the materials are not keeping up. The material trucks are loaded shallowly and must be loaded fully immediately." The material transportation workers and the material loading workers immediately responded to the foreman's call, and the material yard was fighting even more intensely. By the time the meeting ended and the foreman returned to the pig iron furnace section, each of the material trucks was fully loaded.
    After eight hours of battle, the entire shift produced 571 tons of steel, creating the highest shift output record of large converter workshops in the city since this year.

    One Furnace, One Battle
    In the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant's open-hearth furnace workshop, the national red banner of small open-hearth steelmaking, each furnace was a battle, and they were fighting for every second, step by step.
    In November, they created the highest monthly production record since the Great Leap Forward. The steelmaking heroes made a grand pledge: to exceed November again in December! However, two furnaces had to undergo major and intermediate repairs at the beginning of the month, and the originally planned repair time for each furnace was 105 hours, shortening the operation time compared to the previous month. This was truly a tough nut to crack, a great difficulty. The primary task was to shorten the furnace repair time and squeeze out more time for steelmaking.
    To repair quickly, we must dismantle quickly. The key to dismantling quickly is blasting. However, there were only two blasters in our workshop, which was not enough. Hearing the news, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army immediately selected nine blasting experts to support us.
    At midnight on December 1st, the No. 2 open-hearth furnace released its last heat of steel. The blasters Gao Shengfa, Pan Ayu, and the blasting heroes of the People's Liberation Army had already prepared the blasting holes. As soon as the furnace fire stopped, they quickly buried the detonators. Boom, boom, boom... a series of explosions, and the battle to repair the furnace was fully launched. After only 78 hours of assault, the No. 2 furnace was repaired ahead of schedule, creating an unprecedented new record for major and intermediate repairs. Immediately afterwards, the No. 1 furnace created an even higher record of 73 and a half hours.
    As soon as the furnace repair battle ended, the workers immediately ignited and baked the furnace and began the battle to seize steel. As soon as the furnace was started, the furnace workers created a miracle in the furnace's youth: the smelting time averaged less than six hours, producing eight to nine heats of steel every day.
    Everyone calculated: If we continue to maintain this high level of "eight heats in two days, nine heats in one day," we can steadily exceed November in December. However, on the night of the 11th, when they were nervously adding materials for the eighth heat of steel of the day - the last heat of steel, the charging machine broke down. There were still five hours and eighteen minutes until midnight, and they had to rush out this heat of steel in such a short time.
    On the furnace platform, Wang Chi, the Party Branch Secretary of Class A, immediately summoned the duty director and the furnace chief for an emergency meeting.
    As soon as the meeting dispersed, more than one hundred people had already poured onto the platform from who knows where, forming a long line, throwing scrap steel and iron filings at the blazing furnace fire.
    Wang Chi, the Party Branch Secretary, went to Meng Xianbao, the crane navigator, to ask for their assistance. Old Meng patted his chest and said: "No problem, as long as the pig iron furnace has molten iron, I guarantee it will be there whenever you need it." Wang Chi rushed to find Zhang Jifei, the furnace operator of the pig iron furnace. Zhang Jifei said before Wang Chi could open his mouth: "Our molten iron is ready, just waiting for the crane to lift it away!" When Wang Chi had just returned to the furnace, the crane was already carrying the molten iron package, and it was delivered on time.
    Before twelve o'clock at night, the furnace released the last heat of molten steel on time, ensuring eight heats of steel for the day.

  "A Bowl of Ginger Soup Warms the Heart!"
    Late at night, when people were sound asleep in their warm quilts, the workers fighting on the open-air material yard of the steel plant were busy sending pig iron, coke, and lime to the pig iron furnace. Located on the wilderness at the end of the Huangpu River, the material yard of the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant's No. 3 Converter Workshop was particularly empty at this time, and waves of cold air fiercely attacked the people. How wonderful it would be to have a hot bowl of ginger soup!
    Suddenly, the loudspeaker announced: "Please go and drink ginger soup!" Before long, the workers wearing white capes came to the material yard's rest room in groups of three or five. Raising their heads, they couldn't help but be surprised: "Oh, Secretary Zhang, is that you!"
    At this coldest moment, more than three o'clock in the morning, Zhang Changsheng, the deputy secretary of the logistics branch of the No. 3 Converter Workshop, and the catering staff, delivered the ginger soup in large buckets in time. Everyone took off their gloves, smiling, and held the bowls with both hands, slowly drinking. The ginger soup, made with ginger, pepper, brown sugar, etc., was steaming hot, spicy and sweet. The workers drank it into their stomachs and felt bursts of heat bursting out of their bodies, and their faces gradually turned red.
    For a month, whenever it rained heavily or was particularly cold at night, the deputy Party Branch Secretary and the deputy director of the No. 3 Converter Workshop, etc., brought cadres and cooks to deliver ginger soup to the workers. The ginger soup warmed the workers' bodies, and the Party's concern warmed their hearts even more. As they wiped their mouths, they began to discuss:
      "A bowl of ginger soup warms the heart!"
      "After drinking this bowl of ginger soup, I have a clear idea in my mind!"
    The weather is getting colder and colder, the production is getting more and more intense, and the leading cadres and logistics staff of all steel plants in the city are also paying more and more attention to the lives of the masses. They have taken out the same drive as they did in grasping heatstroke prevention and cooling during the high temperature battle, and have done a good job in winter cold prevention and warmth preservation. They have made the canteens even better, delivering hot meals to the rest rooms in front of the furnace, building bamboo sheds for cold protection on the open-air material yards, and lighting fire stoves for heating... The workers eat well, dress warmly, and fight with extra vigor. (Attached picture)

They often "look, touch, and knock" to prevent the water tank from being blocked in time and to keep it unobstructed forever.

    最后胜利在望
    ——记上海钢铁战线夺取全年大捷的生产情景
    本报驻上海记者
    岁末，黄浦江两岸炉火熊熊，钢花飞舞，上海十万钢铁工人最后的总攻击正在全线展开。为了夺得1960年全国钢铁生产的更大胜利，上海钢铁工人光荣地肩负了更繁重的炼钢任务，决心作出更辉煌的贡献！
    他们，向严寒要钢，向时间要钢！进入12月，新纪录从炼钢炉前接踵传来，很多车间普遍地连续地高产。钢产量最大的上钢一厂，三个转炉车间几乎天天高产；著名的上钢三厂第二转炉车间，纪录更为惊人，成绩仍然领先。全市钢的日产量步步上升，接连达到今年以来最高水平。胜利在望，摘下今年钢的跃进果子就在眼前了！
    两兄弟打成平手
    夺取全年胜利的劳动竞赛，在炼钢炉前进行得十分激烈。特别是在上钢一厂第二和第三转炉车间两兄弟之间，更是赛得难分难解。
    12月1日，在全厂决战誓师大会上，连续两次夺得红旗的第二转炉车间工人代表提出：要用钢水把红旗浇在自己的炉子上。话音刚落，第三转炉车间工人徐祥林跳上了台，说道：“我们车间三千多人，要把红旗夺过来插到我们的炉子上！”
    正是，棋逢对手：论设备条件，两个车间大体差不多；论干劲，11月份都提前超额完成了炼钢计划。不过第二转炉车间稍稍多生产了几百吨钢，暂时领了先。现在，双方都决心继续比一比，看谁在完成全厂全年计划的最后决战中贡献最大。
    会后，第三转炉车间工人一鼓作气，开头就占优势，1日、2日两天，超过对手一百多吨钢。3日开始，第二转炉车间立即狠狠追赶，把差距缩短到只有几十吨。接着，又是第三转炉车间领先。每班每小时都有被对手赶上的可能，从车间党总支书记、主任到炉前工人、广播员，不断打电话询问对方的生产情况。吃饭的时候，“战报”前面站满了炼钢工人，边看、边议论、边盘算着今天还要生产多少钢，才能保住优势。
    7日，竞赛到了最紧张的时刻，突然，第三转炉车间四号和五号化铁炉发生了故障。马上打炉？不行！化铁炉开得少了，铁水就供应不上转炉，就要被对手超过，就要影响全厂计划。在这紧张当儿，车间主任和总支书记立即分头到炉前和工人商量，工人们马上采取紧急措施：把四号和五号炉子漏风、漏水的地方堵住，随时加强维护，先顶住，待另外两只炉子修好后再打炉！与此同时，又组织力量突击抢修另外两只炉子。当两只炉子抢修好的时候，四号和五号炉子还在正常生产，从而保证了车间生产继续上升。到9日止，第三转炉车间仍然超过对手一百多吨。只要再过一天，上旬就可以取得胜利了。
    第二转炉车间工人，岂肯轻易失去红旗。就在10日最后这天，发起了猛烈的攻势。上下三班工人一下子就把百多吨钢抢了回来。十天一结算，反比第三转炉车间多了八吨钢！
    两兄弟基本上打成平手。
    冷不防，第一转炉车间从旁“杀”来，把红旗夺了就走。原来，在两个车间你追我赶赛得正热烈的时候，第一转炉车间工人闷声不响，猛干了十天。全厂一评比，第一转炉车间十天就完成了全月计划的37.39％，最高。
    生产第一线上的议论
    在决战激烈进行的时刻，各厂各车间的指挥员身临前线，和工人们一起议论夺取胜利的良策。
    9日夜里，一辆大卡车正在从上钢一厂通向上钢三厂的公路上奔驰。车厢里人们议论纷纷，三厂第二转炉车间党总支书记、值班主任等领导人员抓住时间，和工人们正在商讨着如何赶上一厂。原来，一厂第二、第三转炉车间前几天的一场竞赛，把他们这个全市著名的老红旗车间抛在后面了；现在，他们刚从一厂取经回来。车厢里的议论，从下决心、鼓干劲，转到了研究一厂有那些先进思想和先进经验，如何用到自己的生产上。甲班的干部和工人学习得最认真，议论得最激烈。
    红旗车间的工人，干劲真是大得冲天。12日，甲班工人决心要创造一个惊人的成绩：班产钢五百吨，超指标一百吨！
    班前，车间总支副书记、工长、炉长和工人们分头展开了议论，分析了今天的有利条件和不利条件，确定了措施。一阵简短的商量以后，攀高峰的战斗就在甲班揭开了。车间里，成排的转炉摇摆着庞大的身躯猛吼起来，口里喷吐着烈火浓烟，吹炼时间一炉比一炉短。铁水需要量一小时比一小时多了，化铁炉工人使出了浑身本领，源源不断地把铁水送到了转炉。
    半个班的时间过去了，车间的喇叭里响起了：四小时产钢二百七十一吨，上半班夺得了很大胜利！车间总支副书记袁洪海，马上召集甲班值班主任、化铁炉和转炉工段的工长，就在炉前的广播室里开了一个班中会议，研究后四小时的战斗。
    广播室左边是一座连着一座的转炉，对面是成排的化铁炉，战斗尚在紧张进行。班中会议开得简短有力，大家一致同意把班产计划从五百吨再提高到五百六十吨。广播员把话筒从总支副书记嘴边移到值班主任和工长们嘴边，顿时，总支书记的号召，值班主任的作战布置，工长们的响亮保证，马上就在车间里广播开了。
    喇叭里响起了工长们向总支副书记的保证：能，一定能超过五百六十吨！炉前炉后的工人都兴高采烈，浑身格外有劲。喇叭里响起了化铁炉工长向总支副书记汇报的声音：化铁炉吃得多，料跟不上了，料车装得浅，马上要装满。运料工人和上料工人马上响应工长号召，料场上更紧张地战斗起来。等到会议结束，工长回到化铁炉工段时，一个个的料车都装得满满的。
    八小时战斗下来，全班产钢五百七十一吨，创造了今年以来全市大型转炉车间班产量的最高纪录。
    一炉一个战斗
    在全国小型平炉炼钢红旗——上钢一厂平炉车间里，更是一炉一个战斗，一步紧扣一步地争分夺秒。
    11月份，他们创造了大跃进以来月产最高纪录。炼钢英雄们立下雄心：12月份再超11月！可是，两只炉子月初都要大中修，原计划每只拆修时间是一百零五小时，作业时间比上月缩短了。这真是硬钉子，大困难。首要的任务，是缩短修炉时间，挤出更多的时间来炼钢。
    要修得快，先要拆得快，拆得快的关键是爆破。而自己车间里一共只有两个爆破手，力量不够。解放军某部闻讯，马上选派了九名爆破能手前来支援。
    12月1日子夜，二号平炉放出了最后一炉钢。爆破手高胜法、潘阿玉和解放军的爆破英雄们早已打好了爆破眼，炉火一停，迅速地埋下了雷管。轰，轰，轰……一阵爆炸声，修炉的战斗全面打开。仅仅经过七十八小时的突击，二号炉提前修好了，创造了空前未有的大中修新纪录。紧接着，一号炉更以七十三小时半创造了更高纪录。
    修炉战役刚结束，工人马上点火烘炉，开始夺钢战斗。一开炉，炉前工人又创造了炉子在青年期的奇迹：冶炼时间平均不到六小时，每天出八炉到九炉钢。
    大家盘算：一直保持这样“两天八炉、一天九炉”的高水平前进，12月可稳超11月。可是，到了11日夜里，当他们在为这天的第八炉钢——最后一炉钢紧张加料的时候，加料机坏了。这时到零点还有五小时十八分钟，必须在这样短的时间里抢出这炉钢。
    在炉前平台上，甲班党支部书记王迟立即召集了值班主任、炉长开个紧急会议。
    会一散，平台上不知从哪儿已经涌来了一百多人，排成一字长蛇阵，冲着熊熊的炉火，投掷废钢、铁屑了。
    支部书记王迟呢，赶到行车领航员孟献宝面前，请他们协助。老孟把胸脯一拍：没问题，只要化铁炉有铁水，保证什么时间要就什么时候到。王迟又赶去找化铁炉开炉工张继飞，张继飞不等王迟开口，就说：我们铁水已经准备好了，只等行车来吊走！当王迟刚刚回到炉前，行车已经吊着铁水包，当，当地送来了。
    深夜十二点钟不到，炉子准时放出了最后一炉钢水，全天保证出了八炉钢。
  “一碗姜汤暖人心！”
    夜深，当人们在温暖的被窝里酣睡的时候，战斗在钢铁厂露天料场上的工人们正忙着给化铁炉送去生铁、焦炭和石灰。座落在黄浦江尾旷野上的上钢一厂第三转炉车间，这时料场上显得格外空荡，一阵阵寒气猛烈地袭击着人们。能有一碗热热的姜汤喝喝该又是多好呵！
    突然，喇叭里传出了：“请大家去喝姜汤！”不一会，头戴白色披风帽的工人们，三五成群地来到料场的休息室。猛一抬头，不由得惊奇起来：哎哟，张书记，是你呀！
    在这深夜三点多钟最冷的时刻，第三转炉车间后勤支部副书记张长生和炊事人员，用大桶及时送来了姜汤。大家拉下了手套，笑盈盈地双手捧着碗，慢慢喝着。用生姜、胡椒、红糖等做成的姜汤，热气腾腾，又辣又甜，工人们喝进肚里，只感到阵阵热气从体内迸出，面庞渐渐发红了。
    一个月来，每当下大雨或深夜特别寒冷的时候，第三转炉车间的党总支副书记、车间副主任等人，就这样带着干部和炊事员，给工人们送姜汤。姜汤暖着工人们的身体，党的关怀更温暖了他们的心。他们边揩嘴，就边议论起来：
      “一碗姜汤暖人心！”
      “喝了这碗姜汤，我心里有数！”
    天气越来越寒冷，生产越来越紧张，全市各钢铁厂的领导干部和后勤工作人员也越来越关心群众的生活。他们拿出了奋战高温时抓防暑降温那样的劲头，做好了冬令防寒保暖工作。他们把食堂办得更好了，把热腾腾的饭菜送到炉前的休息室，在露天料场上搭起了防寒的竹棚，生起了烤火用的火炉……。工人们吃得好，穿得暖，战斗起来精神格外饱满。（附图片）
    全国大型化铁炉标兵、上钢三厂第二转炉车间一号化铁炉炉长李宗佑（前右二），和工人们一起研究维护好化铁炉水箱的问题。他们经常做到“看看、摸摸、敲敲”，及时防止水箱堵塞，永保畅通
