How to Do a Good Job in Rural Short-Distance Transportation
The Yuechi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Sichuan Province

In the spring of 1959, with the consolidation and improvement of the communes and the development of diversified operations, people's communes in our county began to engage in transportation. We now have 59 professional transportation teams in the communes, with 905 team members, 629 carts, 819 draft animals, and 62 wooden boats totaling 1,614 tons. Production teams have also organized an auxiliary transportation force that combines farming and transportation, with 510 carts and 524 head of cattle available for transportation, participating in transportation for at least eight months of the year. Although the special district has a motor vehicle team stationed in our county, we have not relied on motor vehicles to solve the county's short-distance transportation problems. From January to October this year, people's commune transportation teams transported a total of 994,000 tons of agricultural, light industrial, chemical, and export goods, accounting for 57% of the county's short-distance freight volume, completing the transportation tasks focused on agriculture. Thanks to the continuous improvement of transportation efficiency, the average monthly output per cart reached 8,389 ton-kilometers, saving 1,095 transportation laborers and enriching the front line of agricultural production.

In the process of running rural short-distance transportation, we mainly focused on the following tasks:

Oriented Towards Agriculture, Combining Professional and Auxiliary Operations, Vigorously Organizing Incidental Transportation

Strengthening the leadership of the Party and firmly establishing the idea of agriculture as the foundation is the fundamental guarantee for running the commune's professional transportation teams well. Two years of practice have proven that transportation is an indispensable part of the commune's production and life, and the development of transportation can promote agricultural leap forward. The county Party committee has consistently educated commune cadres to grasp transportation work while grasping agricultural production. The county Party committee also pointed out that, through overall planning, extracting a small number of laborers to form a professional transportation team can achieve transportation results equivalent to several times the labor force engaged in crash transport. Communes quickly established professional transportation teams. The district and commune Party committees regularly supervised and inspected, consolidated and improved professional transportation teams, and educated team cadres and members to firmly establish the concept of serving agriculture, prioritizing the transportation of agricultural materials, transporting whatever agriculture needed, and transporting it whenever it was needed. For example, the Pingtan district urgently needed more than 110,000 catties of wheat seeds during the autumn planting season, requiring them to be transported to the management area within three days. After receiving the notice, the professional transportation team transported the wheat seeds to the production team in just two days and nights, ensuring timely sowing.

While giving full play to the role of the commune's professional transportation teams and the production teams' auxiliary transportation teams, we also vigorously organized incidental transportation on the premise of not affecting agricultural production and being conducive to agricultural production. Under the unified leadership of the district Party committee and the commune Party committee's finance and trade secretary, transportation and finance and trade departments sent cadres deep into the production teams to prepare for concentrating scattered products and stocking up on transportation tools; then they mobilized cadres and members to use holidays to go to market, attend meetings, and carry manure to the streets, etc., to transport materials incidentally. More than 200,000 tons of materials were transported incidentally in ten months, saving more than 20,000 professional transportation laborers.

Since the communes started running transportation, they first ensured the timely transportation of agricultural production materials, without delaying the farming season. In ten months, the transportation team transported a total of 377,000 tons of seeds, fertilizers, lime, and agricultural machinery for the communes, accounting for 31.5% of the commune transportation team's total freight volume. Secondly, various agricultural products produced by the communes could be transported out in a timely manner, promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. A total of 175,635 tons of various materials were transported out in ten months, accounting for 17% of the freight volume. Thirdly, the daily necessities of commune members were supplied in a timely manner. During this period, a total of 171,205 tons of daily necessities such as coal for canteens were transported, accounting for 17% of the freight volume. Fourthly, 170,000 tons of raw materials and fuels for light industry and chemical industry were transported out, promoting the development of industry. Fifthly, the income of communes and commune members increased. Sixthly, a large number of laborers were saved.

Vigorously Carry Out Tool Reform Centered on Animal-Powered Trains, Improve Transportation Efficiency, and Save Labor

After the establishment of the commune's professional transportation teams, they vigorously reformed transportation tools, improved transportation efficiency, and saved labor. In vehicle manufacturing, the main direction was to realize animal-powered trains, vigorously changing small cars to large cars, changing light cars to heavy cars, changing two wheels to four wheels, changing single cars to trains, changing fixed-frame cars to turntable-frame cars, changing earth brakes to soil-modern combined rack-and-pinion brakes, changing steel wire wheels to iron strip electric welded wheels, changing sliding rings to ball bearings, changing wooden wheels to iron rubber wheels, and changing human pulling to cattle pulling. Three hundred and ninety-five four-wheeled large cars were manufactured, and the average load capacity of each car increased from the original 0.4 tons to 1.5 to 2 tons.

In the activities of building and reforming vehicles, we resolutely followed the mass line and relied on our own efforts. For example, if there was a lack of technical strength, we sent people to iron and woodworking factories to learn, taking those who were capable as teachers and skilled workers leading new hands. Twenty-five vehicle manufacturing and repair factories were established throughout the county, and the county could manufacture vehicles, and each commune could also repair and manufacture vehicles.

Reasonably Distribute Income, Improve Various Systems, and Consolidate the Transportation Team

The reasonable distribution of income is directly related to the consolidation and development of the transportation team. We determined the proportion of income distribution in accordance with national policies, with the goal of developing production and being conducive to consolidating the transportation team.

In order to improve transportation efficiency and give full play to the enthusiasm of transportation team members, in terms of production management, we implemented unified management, unified dispatch, unified freight rates, and unified distribution, fixed tools, fixed tasks, fixed routes, and fixed time, contracted tool maintenance, contracted livestock feeding, contracted transportation volume, contracted safety, contracted loading and unloading, as well as overproduction bonuses and cattle fattening bonuses. The Pingtan district used penicillin and chlorella to feed cattle, which not only saved feed grain, but also made the cattle strong, with sufficient pulling power, ensuring high transportation output. In terms of financial planning management, each commune's professional transportation team was equipped with an accountant and established a system of planning, finance, and quota management, ensuring that expenses were based on vouchers, reimbursements were based on accounts, materials were managed by designated personnel, accounts were cleared daily and monthly, and announced in the current month. This effectively consolidated the transportation team.

Establish a Political Work Network and a Transportation Service Network to Promote Continuous Improvement in Transportation Efficiency

We paid attention to continuously improving the political enthusiasm of the transportation team members. According to the mobile and dispersed situation of the transportation team, we established a ideological and political work network, under the leadership of the local Party committee and the commune Party committee, with stations and vehicle gathering points as the base, with Party member cadres as the backbone, setting up points by line, by area, and by section, dividing labor and contracting, cooperating with each other, and doing a good job in ideological and political work. Wherever the vehicles went, the points were set up there, and everyone received education everywhere. At the same time, we combined political, cultural, and technical education. We also established a transportation service store with the political work network as the center. As soon as employees entered the base point of the service network, there was food, water, books, newspapers, and dormitories; there was also prepared forage, cowsheds, cow hooves, and straw sandals; if they were sick, someone would see a doctor at any time; if the tools were broken, someone would repair them at any time. This ensured that transportation was always booming. For example, within two months of establishing the transportation service network, the Luodu district not only ensured that transportation personnel had relatively comfortable food and lodging conditions, but also repaired more than 80 carts coming and going, equipped with more than 400 spare parts, treated more than 100 sick cattle, and supplied a large number of cow hooves, straw sandals, and forage. The masses praised: With the transportation service store, people and animals have everything they need to eat and live, convenient transportation is praised by everyone, and the enthusiasm is never exhausted.

    怎样办好农村短途运输
    中共四川省岳池县委员会
    1959年春季，随着公社的巩固提高，多种经营的发展，我县人民公社开始办运输。现有公社专业运输队五十九个，队员九百零五人，架车六百二十九部，运输畜力八百一十九头，还有木船六十二只，一千六百一十四吨。生产队也组织了一支亦农亦运的副业运输队伍，拥有架车五百一十部，可以参加运输的耕牛有五百二十四头，一年至少有八个月的时间参加运输。虽然专区在我们县内设有一个汽车队，但我们没有依靠汽车来解决县内短途运输问题。今年1至10月，人民公社运输队共运输农业、轻工、化工、出口物资九十九点四万吨，占全县短途运输货运量的57％，完成了以农业为主的运输任务。由于运输效率不断提高，架车平均月产达到八千三百八十九吨公里，节约运输劳力一千零九十五人，充实了农业生产第一线。
    我们在办农村短途运输的过程中，主要抓了以下几项工作：
    面向农业，专业和副业结合，大力组织捎脚运输
    加强党的领导，坚定不移地树立以农业为基础的思想，是办好公社专业运输队的根本保证。两年来的实践证明，运输是公社生产、生活不可缺少的组成部分；运输的发展，可以促进农业跃进。县委自始至终教育公社干部在抓农业生产的同时，要抓好运输工作。县委还指出，经过统筹安排，抽出少数劳动力，组成专业运输队，其运输效果可以相当于数倍的劳动力突击抢运。各公社迅速把专业运输队建立了起来。各区和公社党委都经常督促检查，巩固提高专业运输队，教育队干部和社员牢固地树立为农业服务的观念，优先运输农业物资，农业要什么就运什么，什么时候要就什么时候运。例如，平滩区在秋种中急需十一万多斤小麦种，要求三天运到管理区，专业运输队接到通知以后，仅两昼夜就把小麦种运到生产队，保证了及时播种。
    在充分发挥公社专业运输队和生产队副业运输队作用的同时，我们还在不影响农业生产、有利于农业生产的前提下，大力组织捎脚运输。在区委、公社党委财贸书记统一领导下，交通、财贸部门派干部深入生产队，做好集中零星产品、备足运输工具等准备工作；然后发动干部、社员等利用假期赶场、参加会议、上街挑粪等机会，捎运物资。十个月捎运的物资有二十多万吨，节约了二万多个专业运输劳动力。
    公社办运输以来，首先保证了农业生产物资及时运输，不误农时。十个月运输队为公社运送的种子、肥料、石灰、农业机械，共计三十七点七万吨，占公社运输队总货运量31.5％。其次，公社生产的各种农产品，能及时运出去，促进了城乡物资交流。十个月运出各类物资一十七万五千六百三十五吨。占货运量的17％。第三，社员生活用品及时得到供应。这一时期共运送了食堂用煤等生活用品一十七万一千二百零五吨，占货运量的17％。第四，运出轻化工原料燃料十七万吨，促进了工业的发展。第五，增加了公社和社员的收入。第六，节约了大批劳动力。
    大搞以畜力列车化为中心的工具改革，提高运效，节约劳力
    公社专业运输队成立以后，大力改革了运输工具，提高运输效率，节约劳动力。在车辆制造方面，以实现畜力列车化为主要方向，大搞改小车为大车、改轻型车为重型车、改双轮为四轮、改单车为列车、改固定架车为转盘架车、改土刹车为土洋结合的排齿刹车、改钢丝轮为铁条电焊轮、改滑圈为滚珠轴承、改木轮为铁胶轮、改人拉为牛拉，改制成了三百九十五部四轮大车，每车载重量平均由原来的零点四吨，提高到一点五至二吨。
    在造车改车活动中，我们坚决走群众路线，自力更生。如技术力量不足，就派人去铁木工厂学习，以能者为师，熟手带新手。全县办起了二十五个车辆制造修配厂，县上能造车，各公社也能修制车辆。
    合理分配收益，健全各种制度，巩固运输队伍
    合理地分配收益，直接关系到运输队的巩固和发展。我们以发展生产、有利于巩固运输队为目标，按照国家政策确定了收益分配的比例。
    为了提高运输效率，充分发挥运输队员的积极性，在生产管理方面，实行了统一管理、统一调度、统一运价、统一分配，定工具、定任务、定路线、定时间，包工具维修、包牲畜饲养、包运量、包安全、包装卸，以及超产得奖、牛长膘得奖的制度。平滩区用青霉素、小球藻喂牛，不仅节约了料粮，而且牛吃了头头健壮，拉力足，保证了运输高产。在财务计划管理方面，公社专业运输队都配备了会计，建立了计划、财务、定额管理制度，做到开支有凭，报销有账，材料有专人管理，账目日清月结，当月公布。这都有力地巩固了运输队伍。
    建立政治工作网和交通服务网，促进运输效率不断提高
    我们注意不断地提高运输队员的政治热情。根据运输队流动分散的情况，建立了思想政治工作网，在当地党委和公社党委领导下，以车站和车辆汇集点为基地，以党员干部为骨干，分线分片、分段设点，分工包干，互相协作，做好思想政治工作。车辆到哪里，点就设在哪里，人人受教育，处处受教育。同时，把政治、文化、技术教育结合起来。我们还以政治工作网为中心，建立了交通服务店。职工一进服务网的基点，就有饭、有水，有书、有报，有宿舍；又有备好的草料、牛棚、牛掌、草鞋；病了随时有人医；工具坏了随时有人修。这就保证了运输月月红。如罗渡区在建立交通服务网的两个月内，不仅保证了运输人员有较舒适的食宿条件，并且修理了来往的架车八十多部，配零件四百余副，医治病牛一百多头，供应了大量的牛掌、牛草鞋、草料等。群众赞扬道：有了交通服务店，人畜吃住样样全，方便运输人人赞，干劲永远使不完。
