Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, December 23rd: Our correspondent reports: The working people of the Mongolian People's Republic have achieved remarkable successes in implementing the Three-Year Plan (1958-1960). During this period, socialist construction has been flourishing, and the pace of socialist transformation has greatly accelerated.

According to the latest information, more than 30 large-scale factories and mines have been newly built, renovated, and expanded nationwide over the past three years. It is estimated that the total industrial output value this year will increase by 65% compared to 1957, thereby greatly exceeding the original growth target of 52% set by the Three-Year Plan.

At the same time, the task stipulated in the Three-Year Plan of realizing collectivization for the majority of herders nationwide has been completed nearly a year ahead of schedule, and the targets for expanding cultivated land area and increasing grain yield per unit area have also been greatly exceeded. Currently, more than 99% of herding households nationwide have joined agricultural and pastoral cooperatives, and the cultivated land area has more than doubled compared to 1957.

Over the past three years, Mongolian industrial workers have rapidly advanced capital construction and production work. During this period, the state's investment in industry was equivalent to 1.5 times the investment in this area during the Second Five-Year Plan (1953-1957). In the three years, in addition to expanding and renovating the Nalaikh Coal Mine and the Ulan Bator Central Thermal Power Plant, new thermal power plants in Sukhbaatar, automated brick and tile factories, Sukhbaatar prefabricated wood structure housing factories, as well as a large number of light industrial enterprises such as wool textile mills, glass factories, paper mills, flour mills, and dairy processing plants, were built. The total output value of these newly built, expanded, and renovated factories and mines is equivalent to about one-third of the total industrial output value of the country in the first ten months of this year. Now, the number of industrial products produced in Mongolia has increased from more than 900 in 1957 to more than 3,000, and the country's power generation capacity has more than doubled compared to three years ago. Many industrial products that Mongolia could not manufacture in the past or relied on imports for are now able to be manufactured and can meet the country's needs. Moreover, Mongolian-produced wool textiles and other products are now exported to several countries.

As a result of the implementation of the Three-Year Plan, Mongolia's young economic sector—agricultural production—has greatly advanced. Mongolia has vast wilderness areas, and the northern, northwestern, and eastern regions have many rivers and arable land. However, in the past, because the people had lived a nomadic life since ancient times, the use of land was limited to pastures; at the same time, because Mongolia is located in a high-altitude and cold region, crop growth encountered many difficulties, so agricultural production developed slowly. In order to change this situation and build the country into an industrial-agricultural and pastoral country, the Mongolian people have taken vigorous measures to develop agricultural production over the past three years, such as vigorously reclaiming wasteland, building water conservancy projects, improving seeds, implementing crop rotation, and increasing yield per unit area. Over the past three years, Mongolia has completed the Kharakhorum water conservancy and irrigation project, which can irrigate 8,000 hectares of cultivated land, and various provinces have also mobilized the masses to build small-scale water conservancy and irrigation projects. The three provinces of Zavkhan, Bayan-Ölgii, and Govi-Altai alone have dug more than 1,000 kilometers of canals, which can irrigate 35,000 hectares of cultivated land. Now, there are 25 state-owned farms nationwide, and the cultivated land area has expanded from more than 82,000 hectares in 1957 to more than 250,000 hectares. The grain yield per hectare has also increased from 7.7 metric tons in 1957 to 12.3 metric tons, and the total grain output has reached 253,500 tons.

During these three years, Mongolia's socialist transformation cause has also greatly developed. The task stipulated in the Three-Year Plan to achieve collectivization for the majority of herders by 1960 was completed ahead of schedule at the end of 1958 and the beginning of 1959. Now, because more than 99% of herding households nationwide have joined agricultural and pastoral cooperatives, and the number of collectively owned livestock has reached about 75% of the total number of livestock in the country, the socialist economic component has an absolute advantage in agriculture and animal husbandry. After merging small cooperatives into large cooperatives, there are now 365 agricultural and pastoral cooperatives nationwide, basically achieving one cooperative per county. Each cooperative has also implemented the integration of government and society.

On the basis of completing collectivization, large-scale settlement work has also been carried out in various pastoral areas. Now, the vast majority of cooperatives across the country have established fixed centers, enabling members to basically settle down. The nomadic lifestyle left over from history is changing. At the same time, due to the implementation of collective labor and unified management, livestock production has also greatly developed. The output of milk and wool has increased year by year. In 1960, the state purchased more than 1,800 tons more of various animal wools than in 1959. Some provinces, such as Bulgan, have also overfulfilled the Three-Year Plan target for increasing the number of livestock.

Now, on the basis of the great achievements of the Three-Year Plan, the Mongolian working people are preparing to work hard to double the total industrial output value and expand the cultivated land area by two times during the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965).

    蒙古人民执行三年计划获新成就
    新建、改建和扩建三十多个大型厂矿，今年工业总产值将比一九五七年增长百分之六十五；百分之九十九以上牧户加入了农牧业合作社，耕地面积比一九五七年扩大了两倍多。
    新华社乌兰巴托23日电　本社记者报道：蒙古人民共和国的劳动人民在执行三年计划（1958—1960年）中取得了显著的成就。在这期间，社会主义建设事业蒸蒸日上，社会主义改造的速度大大加快了。
    根据最新的材料，三年来，全国共新建、改建和扩建了三十多个大型的厂矿企业。预计，今年工业总产值将比1957年增长65％，从而大大超过三年计划原订的增长指标——52％。
    和这同时，三年计划规定的全国大部分牧民实现合作化的任务已经提前将近一年完成，扩大耕地面积和提高谷物单位面积产量的指标也大大超额完成。目前，全国99％以上的牧户都加入了农牧业合作社，耕地面积比1957年扩大了两倍多。
    蒙古工业劳动者三年来把基本建设和生产工作迅速地向前推进。在这期间，国家用于工业的投资相当于第二个五年计划（1953—1957年）这方面投资的一点五倍。在三年中除扩建和改建那来河煤矿、乌兰巴托中央热电站外，还新建了苏赫巴托尔热电站、自动化砖瓦厂、苏赫巴托尔木结构房屋预制厂，以及毛纺织厂、玻璃厂、造纸厂、面粉厂和奶品加工厂等大批轻工业企业。这些新建、扩建和改建的厂矿企业的生产总值，相当于今年头十个月全国工业总产值的三分之一左右。现在，蒙古国内生产的工业品已从1957年的九百多种增加到了三千多种，全国的发电设备能力已增加为三年前的两倍以上。蒙古原来不能制造或者依靠进口的许多工业品，现在已经能够制造，并且能够满足本国的需要。而蒙古生产的毛纺织品等现在还向好几个国家出口。
  由于三年计划执行的结果，蒙古的年轻的经济部门——农业生产大大向前发展了。蒙古有广阔的原野，北部、西北部和东部地区都有很多河流和可耕地。但是，过去由于人民自古以来过着游牧生活，对土地的利用仅限于作牧场；同时，由于蒙古处于高寒地带，农作物的生长遇到很多困难，因此，农业生产发展较慢。为了改变这种情况，把国家建设成为工业—农牧业国，三年来蒙古人民采取了大力开垦荒地、兴修水利、改良种籽、实行轮作和提高单位面积产量等措施，大力发展农业生产。三年来，蒙古已经建成了可灌溉八千公顷耕地的哈拉和林水利灌溉工程，各省也发动群众兴修小型的水利灌溉工程。仅匝盆汗、巴彦乌列盖、戈壁阿尔泰三个省便开凿了一千多公里的水渠，可以灌溉耕地三万五千公顷。现在，全国已有二十五个国营牧场，耕地面积已从1957年的八万二千多公顷扩大到二十五万多公顷，每公顷的谷物产量也从1957年的七点七公担提高到十二点三公担，谷物总产量达到了二十五万三千五百吨。
    在这三年中，蒙古的社会主义改造事业也大大发展了。三年计划规定的到1960年要使大部分牧民实现合作化的任务，在1958年底和1959年初就提前完成了。现在，由于全国99％以上的牧户都加入了农牧业合作社，社有牲畜已达到全国牲畜总头数的75％左右，社会主义经济成分在农牧业中已占绝对优势。经过小社并大社，现在全国共有农牧业合作社三百六十五个，基本上实现了一县一社。各个社内还实行了政社合一。
    在完成合作化的基础上，各地牧区还开展了大规模的定居工作。现在，全国绝大多数合作社都建立了固定的中心，使社员们基本上定居下来。历史上遗留下来的游牧生活状况正在改变。同时，由于实行集体劳动和统一经营，畜牧业生产也获得了很大的发展。奶类和毛类的产量逐年增加，1960年国家收购的各种畜毛便比1959年增加了一千八百多吨。布尔干等省还超额实现了增殖牲畜头数的三年计划指标。
    现在，蒙古劳动人民正在三年计划取得巨大成就的基础上，准备为在第三个五年计划（1961—1965年）期间把工业生产总值提高一倍、耕地面积扩大两倍而奋勇劳动。
