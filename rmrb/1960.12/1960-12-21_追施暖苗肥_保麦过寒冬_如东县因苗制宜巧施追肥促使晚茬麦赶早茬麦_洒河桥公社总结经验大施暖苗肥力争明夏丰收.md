Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: Rudong County, Jiangsu Province, is vigorously grasping the cultivation and management of late-planted wheat, striving to make it catch up with early-planted wheat.

This year, Rudong County has sown 1.16 million mu of three wheat crops and two bean crops, of which late-planted wheat accounts for 63%. Managing this late-planted wheat well is of great importance to the county's overall bumper harvest of the three wheat crops. To this end, the county party committee organized more than 1,500 cadres at three levels in late November to go deep into the teams to help team cadres vigorously grasp the field management of late-planted wheat.

After the cadres at all levels went deep into the teams, they first cooperated with the team cadres to do a good job in ideological work and mobilized the masses to manage the late-planted wheat well. The responsible comrades of the commune party committee who went to the 15th team of the 7th brigade of the Xianmin Commune helped the team cadres mobilize the masses to summarize the experience of managing late-planted wheat last year. Everyone recalled and compared the different harvests of two late-planted wheat fields due to different management. One piece of late-planted wheat was managed early and cultivated well, and fertilizer was applied once before winter; the other piece was managed late and no fertilizer was applied before winter. As a result, the former yielded 30 jin more per mu than the latter. Through the summary, the cadres and commune members improved their understanding and immediately assigned 22 laborers to manage the late-planted wheat, applying fertilizer to 139 mu of late-planted wheat in ten days.

After the cadres at all levels went deep into the grassroots, they, together with the team cadres and experienced farmers, observed the seedling conditions and formulated management measures plot by plot, helping the team cadres manage the late-planted wheat well according to the time, place, and seedling conditions. The responsible comrades of the Chabei Commune Party Committee, together with the team cadres and commune members of the 2nd team of the 8th brigade, observed all 64 mu of late-planted wheat in the team and formulated different management measures for the late-planted wheat of different stubble fields. For the 20 mu of carrot stubble wheat with particularly poor growth, sufficient human manure and urine were applied to promote tillering and strong seedlings, and plant ash was added to keep it warm and prevent frost; for the 32 mu of cotton stubble wheat and buckwheat stubble wheat with thin seedlings and no tillering, plant ash was added to the human manure and urine applied per mu; for the late rice stubble wheat with better growth and one or two tillers, the same method as managing early-planted wheat was adopted, and sufficient river mud was applied per mu.

The county's late-planted wheat management work has been done meticulously and practically. At present, 150,000 mu of late-planted wheat have been topdressed with quick-acting fertilizer, more than 35,000 mu have been covered with plant ash, and more than 100,000 mu of late-planted wheat have basically caught up with the growth of early-planted wheat.

Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang: The Saheqiao Commune in Zunhua County, Hebei Province, mobilized commune members in each production team to sum up their experiences in strengthening the winter management of wheat, apply warm seedling fertilizer to wheat in large quantities to ensure that the wheat safely overwinters, and strive for a bumper harvest next year.

All of the more than 1,200 mu of wheat planted in Saheqiao Commune this year are planted on hillside terraces. According to the characteristics of high terrain and cold climate, the commune party committee put forward the slogan "No ridge of wheat should be frozen, and strive for a bumper harvest next year," and helped each production team mobilize commune members to sum up their experiences in strengthening winter management. The commune members of the Erdaochengzi Production Team summed up the experience of last year's high-yield wheat fields, where the wheat seedlings were not damaged by frost and the yield per mu reached 500 jin because they were covered with a mixed fertilizer of donkey, horse, and sheep manure in winter. After this, each team decided to generally cover all wheat with fertilizer this year. Some production teams also adopted the method of first watering the wheat with urine to promote the development of wheat seedling roots, and then covering it with donkey, horse, and sheep manure according to their own experience. Through summarizing and promoting advanced experience, the commune members further realized the role of fertilizing this winter in winning a bumper wheat harvest next year, so they actively and voluntarily collected urine and fertilizer. The cadres of the commune and production teams also took the lead in accumulating and delivering fertilizer. Li Zhanyi, the secretary of the party branch of the Xiahongzhai Production Team, never left the manure basket when walking. He has collected more than 2,000 jin of manure in the recent period. Under his leadership, more than 80 commune members carried manure baskets on their backs. In order to meet the needs of wheat covering fertilizer, each team adopted the method of pricing and purchasing the existing fertilizer of commune members in cash according to quality. In this way, the general production team has prepared enough two or three carts of fertilizer and about 1,000 jin of urine fertilizer for each mu of wheat. Recently, the whole commune has watered 340 mu of wheat with urine and covered 280 mu with fertilizer.

    追施暖苗肥　保麦过寒冬
    如东县因苗制宜巧施追肥促使晚茬麦赶早茬麦
    洒河桥公社总结经验大施暖苗肥力争明夏丰收
    本报讯　据南京新华日报消息：江苏省如东县狠抓晚茬麦的培植管理，力争晚茬麦赶上早茬麦。
    如东县今年播种三麦、二豆一百一十六万亩，其中晚茬麦占63％，管好这些晚茬麦，对全县夺取三麦全面丰收关系极大。为此，县委在11月下旬就组织三级干部一千五百多人深入小队，帮助小队干部狠抓晚茬麦的田间管理。
    各级干部深入小队后，首先配合小队干部做好思想工作，发动群众管好晚茬麦。深入到先民公社七大队十五小队的公社党委负责同志，帮助小队干部发动群众总结了去年管理晚茬麦的经验。大家回忆对比了两块晚茬麦由于管理不同而收成不同的情况。这两块晚茬麦一块管得早，培植好，冬前施了一遍肥；另一块动手管理晚，冬前又没有施肥，结果前者比后者每亩多收了三十斤。通过总结，干部、社员提高了认识，立即划出二十二个劳动力管理晚茬麦，在十天中就给一百三十九亩晚茬麦追上一遍肥料。
    各级干部深入基层后，都会同小队干部、老农察看了苗情，逐丘逐块订出管理措施，帮助小队干部做到因时因地因苗制宜地管好晚茬麦。岔北公社党委负责同志在八大队二小队和小队干部、社员一道察看了全小队六十四亩晚茬麦后，和社员一起根据不同茬口的晚茬麦订出不同的管理措施。对长势特别差的二十亩胡萝卜茬麦子，施足人粪尿，促使分蘖壮苗，并加盖草木灰，防冻保暖；对苗较瘦弱，还没有分蘖的三十二亩棉茬麦和荞麦茬麦，每亩除施人粪尿外，还加施了草木灰；对长势较好、已有一两个分蘖的晚稻茬麦，采用和管理早茬麦一样的办法，每亩追施足够的河泥。
    全县晚茬麦管理工作做得细致踏实，目前，已有十五万亩晚茬麦追了速效肥，三万五千多亩铺了草木灰，有十万多亩晚茬麦基本上赶上了早茬麦的长势。
    本报讯　据河北日报消息：河北省遵化县洒河桥公社各生产队发动社员总结加强小麦越冬管理的经验，给小麦大施暖苗肥，保证小麦安全过冬，力争明年丰收。
    洒河桥公社今年种植的一千二百多亩小麦全部种在山坡梯田。根据地势高、气候冷的特点，公社党委提出了“小麦一垅不受冻，力争明年大丰收”的号召，并帮助各生产队发动社员总结加强越冬管理的经验。二道城子生产队的社员们，总结了去年小麦丰产田因为冬天盖了骡、马、羊粪混合肥料，保证了麦苗未受冻害、亩产达到五百斤的经验以后，各小队决定今年所有小麦普遍盖肥。还有些生产小队根据自己的经验，采取了先给小麦浇一次尿，促使麦苗根系发育，然后再盖骡、马、羊粪的办法。通过总结推广先进经验，使社员们进一步认识到今冬盖肥对夺取明年小麦大丰收的作用，因而都积极主动地收集尿、肥。公社和生产队的干部也都带头积肥送肥。下洪寨生产队党总支书记李占一走路不离粪筐，最近一个时期拾粪二千多斤，在他的带动下，有八十多名社员背起了粪筐。为了满足小麦盖肥的需要，各小队对社员个人现存的肥料，采取了以质论价，现金收购的办法。这样，一般生产队都为每亩小麦备足了二、三车肥料和一千斤左右的尿肥。最近，全社已有三百四十亩小麦浇了尿，二百八十多亩盖了肥。
