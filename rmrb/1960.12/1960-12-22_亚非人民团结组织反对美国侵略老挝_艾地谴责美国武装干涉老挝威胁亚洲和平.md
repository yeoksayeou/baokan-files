    The Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization Opposes U.S. Aggression Against Laos
    Aidit Condemns U.S. Armed Intervention in Laos as Threatening Asian Peace
    Australian "Tribune" Weekly Points Out that the War in Laos is a Blatant Imperialist Aggressive Intervention
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 20th - The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization issued a statement here today entitled "Stop the Aggression of the United States and SEATO in Laos," strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys for interfering in the internal affairs of Laos.
    The statement called on the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Committees of all countries to support the just struggle of the Lao people against foreign aggression and to strongly protest and condemn the crimes of the U.S. imperialists in Laos.
    The statement demanded that the peoples and governments of Asian and African countries take urgent steps to stop the aggression of the United States and SEATO against the Lao people.
    The statement also called on the supporters of the 1954 Geneva Accords on Indochina to take immediate steps, at this critical juncture in Laos, to stop the aggression of the United States and SEATO against Laos.
    The statement pointed out that "the imperialists and their servants have crudely violated the 1954 Geneva Agreements on Indochina, plotting to turn Laos into their military base, thereby threatening the security of its neighbors."
    The statement also said that the acts of aggression by imperialism and its lackeys against Laos endanger the peace and security of Southeast Asia.
    The statement pointed out, "The actions of the imperialists in Laos once again expose their true face as the most brutal and dangerous enemies of the people of all countries and world peace."
    The statement said, "The peoples of Asia and Africa, who have learned from their own painful experiences, will not be deceived by imperialist conspiracies, and they angrily condemn the intervention and aggression of the United States and SEATO in Laos."
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 20th - In a statement to the press published in today's *People's Daily*, Indonesian Communist Party Chairman D.N. Aidit protested and demanded an end to imperialist aggression in Laos. He also demanded that the Geneva Agreements on Laos be adhered to and implemented.
    Aidit said that the current situation in Laos poses a great threat to peace in Asia and the world. U.S. imperialism is carrying out very blatant interference in the internal affairs of Laos. Aidit pointed out that the United States and members of SEATO are using their military bases in Thailand not only to provide military aid and equipment to their puppet Phoumi-Boun Oum clique, but also to directly send their armed forces to Laos.
    Aidit said that this action by the United States violates the United Nations Charter and the 1954 Geneva Agreements on Laos. Therefore, this destructive action must be condemned by the people of the world who are fighting for independence and peace.
    Aidit said that the Indonesian people unreservedly sympathize with and support the Lao people.
    Xinhua News Agency, December 20th - Sydney News: The Australian *Tribune* Weekly said today that democracy in Laos is being ravaged by U.S. artillery. The weekly pointed out that the war in Laos is a complete and utter imperialist aggressive intervention.
    The weekly said that Prince Souvanna Phouma's only "crime" in the eyes of the United States is that he declared that his country would adhere to neutrality in accordance with the 1954 Geneva Agreements. And this does not suit the United States, which is supporting the rebellion with weapons and money.
    The *Tribune* Weekly called on the people to be vigilant against the Menzies government of Australia's use of the aggressive SEATO to intervene in Laos. It condemned the Menzies government's policy, saying that it seems clear that the Menzies government has entrusted the lives of Australians to the adventurous undertakings of the U.S. imperialists on the Asian continent.

    新华社开罗20日电　亚非人民团结组织书记处今天在这里发表题为“制止美国和东南亚条约组织在老挝的侵略”的声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义者及其走狗干涉老挝内政。
    声明号召各国的亚非人民团结委员会支持老挝人民反对外国侵略的正义斗争，强烈抗议和谴责美帝国主义者在老挝的罪行。
    声明要求亚、非各国人民和政府采取紧急步骤制止美国和东南亚条约组织对老挝人民的侵犯。
    声明还呼吁1954年关于印度支那的日内瓦协议的支持者，在此老挝局势严重之际，立即采取步骤，以制止美国和东南亚条约组织对老挝的侵略。
    声明指出，“帝国主义者和他们的仆从粗暴地违反了1954年关于印度支那的日内瓦协议，策划把老挝变成他们的军事基地，从而威胁其邻国的安全。”
    声明还说，帝国主义及其走狗对老挝的侵略行动，危害了东南亚的和平和安全。
    声明指出，“帝国主义者在老挝的行动，再一次暴露出他们作为各国人民和世界和平的最残暴和最危险的敌人的真面目。”
    声明说，“已经从自己惨痛的经验中获得了教训的亚非各国人民将不会受帝国主义阴谋的欺骗，他们愤怒地谴责美国和东南亚条约组织在老挝进行的干涉和侵略。”
    新华社雅加达20日电　印度尼西亚共产党主席艾地在《人民日报》今天刊载的一篇向报界发表的谈话中抗议并要求制止帝国主义在老挝的侵略。他还要求恪守并执行关于老挝的日内瓦协议。
    艾地说，老挝目前的局势对亚洲和世界和平形成极大的威胁。美帝国主义者正对老挝内政进行非常露骨的干涉。艾地指出，美国和东南亚条约组织成员国利用它们设在泰国的军事基地，除了向它们的傀儡富米—文翁集团提供军事援助和装备以外，还直接派遣它们的武装部队前往老挝。
    艾地说，美国的这种行动破坏了联合国宪章和1954年关于老挝的日内瓦协议。因此，这种破坏行动必须受到争取独立与和平的全世界人民的谴责。
    艾地说，印度尼西亚人民毫无保留地同情并支持老挝人民。
    据新华社20日讯　悉尼消息：澳大利亚《论坛》周报今天说，老挝的民主遭到美国大炮的摧残。这家周报指出，老挝的战争是帝国主义者彻头彻尾的侵略干涉。
    这家周报说，在美国眼中，富马亲王的唯一的“罪行”是他宣布，他的国家将根据1954年的日内瓦协议恪守中立。而这不合用武器和金钱支持叛乱的美国的胃口。
    《论坛》周报号召人民警惕澳大利亚孟席斯政府利用侵略性的东南亚条约组织干涉老挝。它谴责孟席斯政府的政策说，看来很清楚，孟席斯政府已经把澳大利亚人的生命托付给美帝国主义者在亚洲大陆进行的冒险事业。
