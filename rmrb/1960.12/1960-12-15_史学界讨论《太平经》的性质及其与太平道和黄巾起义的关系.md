    Historical Circles Discuss the Nature of the *Taiping Jing* and its Relationship with the Taiping Dao and the Yellow Turban Uprising

    Regarding the nature of the *Taiping Jing* (*Taiping Qingling Shu*) by Yu Ji of the Eastern Han Dynasty and its relationship with Zhang Jiao's Taiping Dao and the Yellow Turban Uprising, there have been different views in Chinese historical circles in recent years.

    One view holds that the *Taiping Jing* reflects the socio-political ideals of the peasant uprising, and is a "classic of peasant Taoism" or a "theoretical work of peasant revolution." *A General History of Chinese Thought*, Volume 3, edited by Hou Wailu et al. and published by Sanlian Bookstore in 1957, argues that the "teachings" of Zhang Jiao's Taiping Dao "can be found in the existing *Taiping Jing* to some extent." The *Taiping Jing* also reveals fragments of the rebellious consciousness of the uprising peasants and their curses and hatred towards the ruling class. *The Ideal of Great Harmony in Chinese Dynasties*, edited by Hou Wailu and written by Zhang Qizhi et al., published by Science Press in April 1959, explicitly calls the *Taiping Jing* a "classic of peasant Taoism," believing that the program of Zhang Jiao's Taiping Dao is "vaguely reflected through religious doctrines." In discussions about the historical evaluation of Cao Cao, some articles also hold this view. Yuan Liangyi, in his article "The Role of the Yellow Turban Uprising and Cao Cao's Historical Status" (People's Daily, May 22, 1959), and Xu Zhi, in his article "The Peasant Uprising at the End of the Han Dynasty and Cao Cao" (Guangming Daily, June 25, 1959), also stated that the ideal of a peaceful world in the Taiping Dao, as reflected in the *Taiping Jing*, is one without exploitation, equal labor, and distribution according to needs. Yang Kuan, in his article "On the *Taiping Jing* – China's First Theoretical Work of Peasant Revolution," published in *Academic Monthly* in the ninth issue of 1959, believes that the existing *Taiping Jing* in the *Daozang* is the classic *Taiping Qingling Shu* of the Taiping Dao. The Yellow Turban Uprising led by Zhang Jiao was theoretically based on the *Taiping Jing*. The *Taiping Jing*'s "Taiping" social thought calls for the realization of "great equality." The *Taiping Jing* also proposes the idea of "people as the foundation."

    Prior to this, Lü Zhenyu, in his book *A History of Chinese Political Thought* (Sanlian Bookstore, 1955 edition), had already stated that Yu Ji's *Taiping Qingling Shu* was the "bible" of the peasant class at that time, which is why it became the doctrine of Zhang Jiao's Taiping Dao. However, Lü Zhenyu believes that the existing *Taiping Jing* is unreliable. Later, Lü Zhenyu, in his *A Concise History of China*, said that from the existing, tampered and forged *Taiping Qingling Shu*, some elements of primitive socialist thought can still be seen.

    Contrary to the above view, one opinion holds that the *Taiping Jing* is full of reactionary religious doctrines and is not a "theoretical work of peasant revolution." Rong Sheng, in his article "A Preliminary Discussion on the *Taiping Jing*" (*Historical Research*, No. 11, 1959), said: "Besides a large number of religious superstitions that advocate the following of Heaven and Earth and the Five Elements, what the *Taiping Jing* directly involves in human life is nothing more than promoting the idea of loyalty to the monarch, advocating contentment with poverty and pleasure in humility, defending the exploitation system, paralyzing the masses' consciousness of struggle with religious doctrines, and advocating the use of force to suppress peasant uprisings. Therefore, this book cannot be called a 'theoretical work of peasant revolution.'" Furthermore, Rong Sheng believes that although the "Taiping" world in the *Taiping Jing* has certain positive significance, it cannot be interpreted as an ideal society of "no exploitation, equal labor, and distribution according to needs." In addition, Rong Sheng believes that Zhang Jiao may not have had the book *Taiping Jing*. Even if Zhang Jiao did have the *Taiping Jing*, he might not have used it as a classic. The real reason for the peasant uprising lies in the intensification of class contradictions. The reason why the Yellow Turban Uprising was cloaked in Taoism was merely to borrow the influence of Taoism among the masses, to use the factors that could be used, and to cover up the activities of its leaders.

    Prior to this, Fan Wenlan's revised edition of *A Brief History of China* (People's Publishing House, 1958 edition) also touched on the above issues. Fan Wenlan said: The *Taiping Qingling Shu* "specializes in following Heaven and Earth and the Five Elements as its foundation." There are no remarks in it that resist the ruling class. Although Zhang Jiao's Taiping Dao played a role in launching the Yellow Turban Uprising, it cannot be said to be a religion that resisted dark rule; although the Yellow Turban Army was covered in the dust of Taoism, its essence was still a just peasant war.

    In addition to the above two opposing views, some people believe that the *Taiping Jing* was not written by one person at one time, so its content is mixed, impure, and self-contradictory. Wang Ming, in the preface to his book *Taiping Jing: Collated and Annotated Edition*, published by Zhonghua Book Company in February 1960, said: "Most of the *Taiping Jing*'s space is devoted to promoting theism, religious idealism, and the ideology of the ruling class of feudal society, but some of its chapters also reflect the progressive ideas and correct views of the time." The reason is that the *Taiping Jing* was not written by one person at one time. As for the relationship between the *Taiping Jing* and the Yellow Turban Uprising, Wang Ming said that its progressive ideological part "also provided some inspiration" for Zhang Jiao, Zhang Lu, and others.

### 史学界讨论《太平经》的性质及其与太平道和黄巾起义的关系

    史学界讨论《太平经》的性质及其与太平道和黄巾起义的关系
    关于东汉于吉的《太平经》（《太平清领书》）一书的性质及其同张角的太平道和黄巾起义的关系，近年来我国历史学界有不同的看法。
    一种意见认为，《太平经》反映了起义农民的社会政治理想，是“农民道教的经典”或“农民革命的理论著作”。1957年三联书店出版的侯外庐等著的《中国思想通史》第三卷中，认为张角的太平道的“教法”在现存的《太平经》中“多少可以找到一些影子”。在《太平经》中，也片断地透露出起义农民的反抗意识及其对统治阶级的咒诅与仇恨。1959年4月科学出版社出版的侯外庐主编、张岂之等执笔的《中国历代大同理想》一书中，更明确地称《太平经》为“农民道教的经典”，认为张角的太平道的纲领“通过宗教的教义模糊地折射出来”。在关于曹操的历史评价的讨论中，有的文章也有这种观点。袁良义在其《黄巾起义的作用和曹操的历史地位》一文（1959年5月22日《人民日报》）中，徐知在其《汉末农民起义与曹操》一文（1959年6月25日《光明日报》）中，也说太平道的太平世界的理想，在《太平经》中反映出来，就是没有剥削，同等劳动，各取所需。杨宽在《学术月刊》1959年第九期发表的《论《太平经》——我国第一部农民革命的理论著作》一文中认为，现存《道藏》中的《太平经》就是太平道的经典《太平清领书》。张角所领导的黄巾起义，在理论上就是根据《太平经》的。《太平经》的“太平”社会思想，是要求实现“大平均”。《太平经》还提出了“民为本”的说法。
    在此以前，吕振羽在其《中国政治思想史》一书（三联书店1955年版）中就已经说，于吉的《太平清领书》是当时农民阶级的“圣经”，所以它成了张角的太平道的教义。但是，吕振羽认为现存的《太平经》是不足凭信的。后来吕振羽又在其《简明中国通史》一书中说：从现存的被篡改和伪造的《太平清领书》中，还可以看出一些原始社会主义思想的因素。
    与上述看法相反，一种意见认为，《太平经》充满着反动内容的宗教教义，不是一部“农民革命的理论著作”。戎笙在其《试论《太平经》》一文（《历史研究》1959年第十一期）中说：《太平经》除了大量的奉天地顺五行的宗教迷信之外，直接涉及到人间生活的，无非是宣扬忠君思想，宣扬安贫乐贱，为剥削制度作辩护，用宗教教义麻痹群众的斗争意识，并主张采用武力镇压农民起义。因此，这部书是不能称之为“农民革命的理论著作”的。并且，戎笙认为《太平经》的“太平”世界虽有一定的积极意义，但它是不能解释为“没有剥削，同等劳动，各取所需”的理想社会的。此外，戎笙认为张角不一定有过《太平经》这部书。即使张角确实有了《太平经》，他也未必就以它作为经典。农民起义的真正原因在于阶级矛盾的尖锐化。黄巾起义之所以披上了道教的外衣，不过是因为借道教在群众中的影响，利用其中可以利用的因素，并掩护其领袖的活动。
    在此以前，范文澜的《中国通史简编》修订本（人民出版社1958年版）中也曾经涉及上述问题。范文澜说：《太平清领书》“专以奉天地顺五行为本”。其中是没有反抗统治阶级的言论的。张角的太平道虽然起着发动黄巾军起义的作用，但它不能说是反抗黑暗统治的宗教；黄巾军虽然蒙着道教的灰尘，但它的本质依然是正义的农民战争。
    除了上述两种对立的意见以外，还有人认为《太平经》并非一人一时所作，所以其内容是杂糅不纯、自相矛盾的。王明在1960年2月中华书局出版的《太平经合校》一书的前言中说：《太平经》的“大部分篇幅是宣扬有神论、宗教唯心论和封建社会统治阶级的思想的，但其中一些篇章也反映了当时的进步思想和正确的观点”。其原因是《太平经》并非一时一人所作。至于《太平经》同黄巾起义的关系，王明说，它的进步的思想部分对张角、张鲁等“也有所启发”。
