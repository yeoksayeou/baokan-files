Saving coal and increasing steel production, that is, producing more steel with the same amount of coal, is a long-term task for the steel industry. Under the premise of ensuring product quality, how much coal can be saved per ton of steel and per ton of iron is related not only to the development of the steel industry, but also to the development of the entire national economy.

Why is saving coal a long-term task for the steel industry?

This is not only because the potential for saving coal in the steel industry is great, but also because it is a regular and effective measure to increase steel production. In October this year, the large blast furnace with the lowest coke consumption per ton of iron in the country was Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 7 blast furnace, with an average coke ratio of 630 kilograms, while the average was over 700 kilograms. Compared with Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 7 blast furnace, ordinary blast furnaces consume more than 100 kilograms of coke per ton of iron. The difference between advanced and backward is even more significant in small and medium-sized blast furnaces. The output of pig iron from small and medium-sized blast furnaces accounts for more than half of the country's total pig iron output. They were all built since the Great Leap Forward, and management experience and technical experience are gradually being accumulated. Some small and medium-sized blast furnaces have made rapid progress, with not only high pig iron output and good quality, but also low coke consumption. In October, the average coke ratio of small blast furnaces in Wanshui Iron Plant in Sichuan, Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory, Linfen Hedi Iron Plant in Shanxi, and Lianong Iron Plant in Ma'anshan City, Anhui, reached the level of 600 to 800 kilograms. The coke consumption of these small blast furnaces is not only much lower than the national standards, close to the level of large blast furnaces, and some even exceed the level of advanced large blast furnaces. However, at present, there are only a few such small and medium-sized blast furnaces. The coal consumption of most small and medium-sized blast furnaces is higher than that of large blast furnaces, and the coke consumption of many small and medium-sized blast furnaces far exceeds the national standards. If the national average of small and medium-sized blast furnaces is reduced by 300 kilograms on the existing level, then according to the existing pig iron output, 3 to 4 million tons of coke can be saved in one year, which is equivalent to saving more than 6 million to 8 million tons of coal. How much wealth can the state create by using this coal for light industrial production or other industries! How big a problem can be solved by the railway saving more than 6 million to 8 million tons of transportation capacity to transport other materials!

Saving coal is of particularly important significance to the development of the steel industry. Ore and coke (processed coking coal) are the two main raw materials for ironmaking, and they are smelted together in a blast furnace. The volume of blast furnaces is limited. If more coke is loaded, less ore is loaded, and the iron produced is relatively reduced. Conversely, if less coke is loaded, more ore is loaded, and the iron produced will be relatively increased. That is to say, saving coal can not only use the saved coal to refine more steel, increase the total output, but also create conditions for improving the output of each furnace of iron, that is, increasing the output per unit area—the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace. At the same time, using less coke is also conducive to improving the quality of pig iron. Therefore, by saving coal and reducing the amount of coal used per ton of iron and per ton of steel as much as possible, it can not only reduce the cost of steel, but also directly promote high yield and high quality. Workers on the steel front should regard saving coal as a long-term task for developing the steel industry in a faster, better and more economical way, and as a positive and important measure to further comprehensively improve the technical level of China's steel industry.

Coal is the main raw material or fuel for heavy industry, light industry, transportation and people's lives. In the past three years, China's coal production has continuously increased substantially. However, due to the rapid development of China's steel industry, power industry, light industry and transportation industry, the country's demand for coal has also increased greatly. Now, coal production has become the central link in current industrial production. The growth of coal production not only affects the growth of steel production, but also affects the growth of other heavy industry and light industry production, and affects the arrangement of transportation and people's lives. In order to ensure the needs of continuous development of various departments, we must firmly grasp this central link. On the one hand, all coal mining enterprises are required to do everything possible to increase coal production under the premise of rational mining, protecting resources, paying attention to both coal mining and tunneling; on the other hand, all units and enterprises that use coal are required to practice strict economy. Steel enterprises use the largest and most frequent amount of coal, and they should pay special attention to saving and strive to reduce the coal consumption per ton of iron and per ton of steel.

Saving coal in the steel industry is not only necessary and possible, but also truly achievable. Since the launch of the increased production and thrift campaign centered on grain and steel in August this year, the amount of coke used per ton of iron has been significantly reduced, and great achievements have been made. However, for our future production, the most valuable thing is not how many kilograms of coke have been saved, but the successful experience of saving coke has been accumulated and summarized in some large, medium and small enterprises. The road to ensuring product quality and saving coal has been opened up. The problem now is how to take solid and effective measures to universally apply the advanced experience of saving coal (coke) in all steel enterprises, and to be determined to increase steel production in a period of time without increasing or even reducing coal.

In order to achieve this goal, a necessary measure is to include saving coal in the production plan. Make saving coal an important part of technical innovation and labor competition. When learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced, we must not only learn from the advanced in terms of output and quality, but also in terms of saving coal. In order to make the existing coking coal play a greater role, every steel enterprise must consciously supply coking coal first to those blast furnaces that use less coke per ton of iron, and give full play to their production potential, in accordance with the principle of concentrating forces to fight annihilation battles. For those small blast furnaces whose coke consumption per ton of iron exceeds the national standard by too much, active measures should be taken, and a time limit should be set to reach an appropriate level of coal consumption. If it is impossible to reach this level temporarily due to poor conditions, then it should be considered to temporarily stop these furnaces and wait until the conditions are available before production. This is the overall view that every enterprise should have, and it is also the guarantee for each enterprise to strictly complete the national plan in terms of quality, quantity and variety.

Ensuring steel quality and using less coal, of course, not only depends on people's understanding and mental state, not only depends on ideological and political work, but also depends on a series of technical and management work. Among them, the most important is the work of carefully selecting raw materials. Fine materials, large air volume, and high temperature are our ironmaking policy. However, these three are not parallel, and should be based on fine materials. After the raw materials are carefully selected, the ore grade is improved and the particles are uniform, which can save coke and produce more iron. In order to ensure that the blast furnace can eat fine materials, the mines must continue to vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, and vigorously engage in mechanization and semi-mechanization. Once the problem of fine materials is solved, the problems of improving iron quality, improving the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces, and saving labor will be easily solved, and the cost will be reduced.

In addition to carefully selecting raw materials, the size of the air volume, the height of the air temperature, the amount of ash in the coke, the size of the coke block, the amount of loss during transportation, and whether the management is strict, etc., all directly affect the consumption of coke. Why did Bajie Long Iron Plant, one of the red flags for saving coke on the ironmaking front in Sichuan Province, only use an average of more than 700 kilograms of coke per ton of iron from September last year to September this year? The main reason is that in addition to carrying out extensive and in-depth education on saving coke among employees, the plant also did a series of meticulous work from coke entering the factory to smelting in the furnace. They pay great attention to improving the ore grade. In the past, people were careless when getting on and off the bus during transportation, and many coke were broken into debris; now they use baskets to pack them and put them down gently. In the past, the two-hammer crushing method was used to crush broken coke blocks, which produced a lot of debris. Now, the coke grains are cut with specially-made knives, which greatly reduces the debris. After the coke enters the furnace, they also conscientiously implement operating procedures and various responsibility systems. Jielong Iron Plant is a small enterprise with general equipment and technical conditions. Its experience tells us that as long as we combine the revolutionary spirit of daring to fight with the down-to-earth style of solving specific problems, on the one hand, we will focus on ideological and political work, and on the other hand, we will focus on the specific technical work and management work in all links, we will be able to achieve a large-scale harvest in saving coal. The goal of saving coal and producing more steel will surely be achieved!

### 节约煤炭是钢铁工业的长期任务

    节约煤炭是钢铁工业的长期任务
    节约煤炭，增产钢铁，即用同样多的煤炭生产更多的钢铁，是钢铁工业一项长期的任务。在保证产品质量的前提下，每炼一吨钢、一吨铁，能节约多少煤炭，不只关系着钢铁工业生产的发展，也关系着整个国民经济的发展。
    为什么节约煤炭是钢铁工业的长期任务呢？
    这不但因为钢铁工业节约煤炭的潜力很大，而且因为它是增产钢铁的一项经常的有效的措施。今年10月份，全国大型高炉中炼一吨铁使用焦炭最少的是鞍钢七号高炉，平均入炉焦比是六百三十公斤，而一般的是七百多公斤。与鞍钢七号高炉相比，一般的高炉每炼一吨铁，要多用焦炭一百多公斤。先进与落后的差别，在中小型高炉里更为显著。中小型高炉的生铁产量，占全国生铁总产量的一半以上。它们都是大跃进以来才建设起来的，管理经验和技术经验都正在逐步积累。有些中小型高炉进步很快，不但生铁产量高，质量好，焦炭消耗量也很低。10月份，四川的万水铁厂、济南市印染厂、山西临汾河底铁厂、安徽马鞍山市联农铁厂等的小高炉的平均入炉焦比，都达到了六百到八百公斤水平。这些小高炉的焦炭消耗量，不但大大低于国家规定的指标，接近了大型高炉的水平，有的甚至超过了先进大型高炉的水平。但是，目前这一类中小型高炉为数不多。大多数中小型高炉的耗煤量，都比大型高炉的高，不少中小型高炉的焦炭消耗量还远远地超过了国家规定的指标。如果全国的中、小型高炉在现有水平上平均降低三百公斤，那么按照现有的生铁产量估计，一年就可节约三、四百万吨焦炭，就等于节约六百多万到八百万吨煤。国家将这些煤用于轻工业生产或其他工业，将能创造多么大的财富啊！铁路将节约出的六百多万到八百万吨的运输力量来运输别的物资，又能解决多么大的问题啊！
    节约煤炭，对钢铁工业的发展，具有特别重要的意义。矿石和焦炭（加工后的焦煤），是炼铁的两种主要原料，一起放在高炉里冶炼。高炉的容积都是有限度的。焦炭装得多了，矿石就装得少些，出的铁也就相对地减少。相反地，焦炭装得少了，矿石就装得多，出的铁就会相对地增加。就是说，节约煤炭，不但可以利用节约下来的煤炭炼更多的钢铁，增加总产量，还可以为提高每一炉铁的产量，即提高单位面积产量——高炉利用系数创造条件。同时，少用焦炭还有利于提高生铁质量。因此，通过节约煤炭，尽可能降低每吨铁、每吨钢的用煤量，不只能够降低钢铁的成本，而且能够直接促进高产和优质。钢铁战线上的职工们，应当把节约煤炭看做多快好省地发展钢铁工业的一个长期任务，看做进一步全面地提高我国钢铁工业技术水平的一个积极的重要的措施。
    煤炭是重工业、轻工业、交通运输业和人民生活的主要原料或燃料。近三年来，我国煤炭产量连续地大幅度增长。但是，由于我国钢铁工业、电力工业、轻工业和交通运输业等也在高速度地发展，国家对煤炭的需要量也大大地增加了。现在，煤炭的生产已经成为当前工业生产的中心环节。煤炭生产的增长，不仅影响着钢铁生产的增长，也影响着其他重工业、轻工业生产的增长，影响着交通运输事业和人民生活的安排。为了保证各个部门继续发展的需要，我们必须紧紧地抓住这个中心环节。一方面，要求所有煤矿企业，都要在合理开采、保护资源、既注意采煤又注意掘进的前提下，千方百计地增加煤炭生产；另一方面，要求一切使用煤炭的单位和企业，都要厉行节约。钢铁企业用煤数量最大，最经常，更要特别注意节约，努力降低每一吨铁、每一吨钢的煤炭消耗量。
    钢铁工业节约煤炭，不只是必要的和可能的，而且是确实办得到的。今年8月开展以粮钢为中心的增产节约运动以来，每吨铁的用焦量，已有了显著降低，成绩很大。但是，对我们今后的生产来讲，最宝贵的还不是已经节约了多少公斤焦炭，而是在一些大中小型的企业里，已经积累和总结了节约焦炭的成功经验。既保证产品质量，又节约用煤的道路已经开辟了。现在的问题，就看我们如何踏踏实实，采取有效措施，把节约煤炭（焦炭）的先进经验在一切钢铁企业中普遍运用起来，并且下定决心在一个时期内不增加煤炭甚至减少煤炭也要增产钢铁。
    为了达到这个目的，一个必要的措施是把节约用煤列入生产计划。把节约用煤作为技术革新和劳动竞赛的一个重要内容。在学先进、比先进、赶先进的时候，不但要在产量和质量方面，还要在节约用煤方面向先进者看齐。为了使现有的焦煤发挥更大的效果，每一个钢铁企业都要本着集中力量打歼灭战的原则，自觉地把焦煤首先供应那些每吨铁用焦少的高炉先用，充分发挥它们的生产潜力。对于那些每吨铁用焦量超过国家规定标准过多的小高炉，要积极采取措施，并且要规定限期达到适当的耗煤水平。如果因为条件太差，一时不可能达到这种水平，那末就应当考虑把这类炉子暂时停下来，等到条件具备时再生产。这是每一个企业应有的全局观点，也是每个企业严格按质按量按品种地完成国家计划的保证。
    既保证钢铁质量，又少用煤，当然不仅仅决定于人们的认识和精神状态，不仅仅决定于思想政治工作，而且还决定于一系列的技术工作和管理工作。其中特别重要的是精选原料的工作。精料、大风、高温，是我们生铁冶炼的方针。但这三者又不是并列的，应当以精料为基础。原料经过精选，提高了矿石品位，颗粒均匀，就能少用焦炭，多出铁。为了保证高炉能吃到精料，矿山必须继续大力开展技术革新、技术革命运动，大搞机械化半机械化。精料问题解决了，提高铁的质量、提高高炉利用系数、节约劳动力等问题，也就容易解决，成本也就降低了。
    除了精选原料以外，风量的大小，风温的高低，焦炭灰分的多少，焦炭块的大小，运输过程损失的大小，管理是否严格等等，都直接影响着焦炭的消耗量。四川省炼铁战线上节约焦炭的红旗之一——巴县接龙铁厂，为什么从去年9月到今年9月，平均每吨铁只用七百多公斤焦？主要就是由于这个厂除了在职工中广泛地深入地进行节约焦炭的教育外，同时在焦炭进厂到入炉冶炼做了一系列细致的工作。他们十分注意提高矿石品位。在运输过程中，过去上下车不小心，很多焦炭被摔成碎屑；现在他们用篓子装好，轻放轻下。过去破碎焦块采用二锤打碎法，碎末多，现在顺着焦炭纹路用特制的刀砍，大大减少了碎末。焦炭入炉后，他们又认真执行操作规程和各种责任制度。接龙铁厂是个小型企业，设备技术条件是一般的。它的经验告诉我们，只要把敢于斗争的革命精神和踏踏实实地解决具体问题的作风结合起来，一方面抓紧思想政治工作，一方面抓紧各个环节的具体的技术工作和管理工作，就一定能够在节约用煤方面实现大面积丰收。节约煤炭，多产钢铁的奋斗目标，一定能够达到！
