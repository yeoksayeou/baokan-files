    Fertilizer is the Foundation of Increased Grain Production
    ——An Investigation of Fertilizer Work in the Lingdong Management Area of Gujiao Commune, Lingchuan County, Shanxi

    Fertilizer is the "grain" of grain. With more fertilizer, plus diligent management and skillful application, coupled with intensive cultivation, grain production will inevitably increase year after year. The Lingdong Management Area of Gujiao Commune in Lingchuan, Shanxi, has been a banner unit for high grain production in the county for the past three years due to its focus on fertilizer.

    The Lingdong Management Area, historically known as "Old Dongshan," is nestled between Wangmang Mountain to the north and Ma Wu Mountain to the south, with forty-eight large and small hills stretching across the region. The area has 310 households with a population of 1,205. The 2,640 mu of cultivated land are divided into over 11,000 plots, with the thickest soil layer being no more than one meter and the thinnest being only half a foot. Before liberation, the highest annual yield of grain fields averaged only about 100 jin per mu. After liberation, especially since the establishment of the people's communes, grain production has increased year after year on the same land. In 1957, the total grain output of the area increased by 1.4 times compared to 1949. After the establishment of the people's commune in 1958, the total grain output increased by 30.9% compared to 1957. Although 1959 suffered a severe drought, the total grain output still increased by 2.7% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. This year's crops are growing even better than last year.

    Good crops can grow on this land of thick stone and thin soil, and yields increase year after year, mainly because of the good leadership of the Party, the great strength of the people's communes, and the good implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. But there is also a special feature in this management area, which is the emphasis on fertilizer.

    Before liberation, the amount of pen manure from large livestock and pigs and sheep was very small, with only about 30 dan of fertilizer applied per mu (1 dan is calculated as 100 jin, same below). After liberation, especially during the process of cooperation, the number of large livestock and pigs and sheep increased, and the avenues for accumulating fertilizer were greatly expanded. By 1957, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu reached 153 dan. After the establishment of the people's commune in 1958, the level of fertilization was further improved, and full bottom fertilization once plus topdressing twice was achieved (one base fertilizer application, two topdressing applications), and the amount of fertilizer applied per mu increased to 198 dan. In 1959, a major innovation of "three pens" (large livestock pen, pig pen, sheep pen) was realized, with fertilizer pits set up locally, combining the accumulation of soil fertilizer with the creation of chemical fertilizer, and the amount of fertilizer applied per mu continued to increase to 234 dan. This year, an average of 1.5 head of large livestock per household and 1.3 sheep per person, and one pig for every two households have been achieved. In addition, the broad masses of commune members have widely opened up fertilizer sources, greatly accumulated and created fertilizer, and the amount of fertilizer applied per mu has increased by 12% compared to 1959.

    With the increase in large livestock and pigs and sheep, the strengthening of fertilizer accumulation and the continuous innovation of fertilizer accumulation and production technology, the quality of fertilizer is also constantly improving. According to their classification standards and comparisons: first-class high-quality fertilizer accounted for 30.1% of the total amount of fertilizer applied in 1957, and 52.1% this year; second-class fertilizer accounted for 43.3% in 1957, and 41.8% this year; third-class fertilizer accounted for 26.6% in 1957, and 6.1% this year.

      Widen Fertilizer Sources, Accumulate and Produce Fertilizer
    "It's just a waste of effort to farm without fertilizer," this is an important experience accumulated by farmers over thousands of years. However, this was not given enough attention before 1957. At that time, not only was there very little artificial fertilizer production, but little attention was also paid to pen manure from livestock, pigs and sheep, and the accumulation of fertilizer by commune members' families was in a state of laissez-faire. The lessons of the past few years have corrected people's understanding, and the management area Party branch began to put a lot of effort into fertilizer starting in the spring of 1958. After continuous research and repeated exploration, they finally found the "accumulation, creation, composting, smoking, exchange (exchanging old kang for new kang), burning (burning asphalt), digging (digging thatch bottoms, well bottoms, pond bottoms), pressing (green manure), sweeping (road soil), picking up (miscellaneous fertilizer)" ten-character fertilizer accumulation method, and achieved "three improvements and eight cleans." The three improvements are: improving livestock pens, improving fertilizer pits, and improving latrines. The eight cleans are: cleaning land, cleaning threshing grounds, cleaning slopes, cleaning roads, cleaning courtyards, cleaning streets, cleaning millstone paths, and cleaning field ridges. Due to the wide opening of fertilizer sources, the amount of fertilizer accumulated and applied has increased year after year since then. They also found out the laws of fertilizer accumulation according to seasonal changes and the busy and idle seasons of agricultural work, and adopted a combination of professional fertilizer accumulation and seasonal surprise attacks, so the fertilizer accumulated was large in quantity and good in quality.

    Secondly, in fertilizer accumulation, they grasped both the collective and the individual. In order to encourage commune members' families to accumulate fertilizer, they adopted a combination of ideological education and material encouragement. Commune members who value family fertilizer accumulation and actively invest fertilizer in the commune are commended, and the methods of pricing according to quality, cash purchase, and bonus for exceeding the quota are implemented. In order to solve the contradiction between commune members selling fertilizer to the commune and fertilizing their own private plots, the "basic fertilizer system" was generally implemented. Commune members can dispose of the portion exceeding the basic fertilizer quota themselves. This not only facilitated the masses but also avoided the contradiction of competing for fertilizer between the collective and the individual, so that the accumulation of fertilizer by commune members' families has been increasing along with the growth of the total amount of fertilizer applied to the land in the entire area. In 1957, commune members' families accumulated only 73,000 dan of fertilizer, and this year it has reached 203,000 dan, accounting for 23.5% of the total amount of fertilizer applied in the whole area throughout the year.

    While greatly accumulating natural fertilizer, they also relied on the masses, used local methods, and built a small-scale local chemical fertilizer plant. In addition to using the local method of boiling nitrate to produce a large amount of brine fertilizer, the local chemical fertilizer plant also absorbed the experience of manufacturing local chemical fertilizer from other places and successfully trial-produced urea, bone meal, ammonium sulfate, cypress leaf fertilizer and other local chemical fertilizers. In the year or so from last year to the present, it has produced more than 60,000 jin of various local chemical fertilizers.

      Three Pens to the Fields, Saving Labor
    The potential of fertilizer is inexhaustible. As long as you are diligent, it can be found everywhere. However, with the increase in the quantity of fertilizer and the improvement in quality, a major problem arose in the use of labor. In 1958, the number of workdays invested in accumulating and transporting fertilizer in this management area reached more than 44,000, equivalent to the workload of more than 140 laborers for the whole year. However, the full and half labor force of men and women in the entire area is only 226 at most, so how can there be so much labor to accumulate and transport fertilizer all year round? In order to solve this problem, they adopted the method of "adapting to local conditions, rational layout, and the combination of the three major aspects." This method is:

    First, the fertilizer accumulation team and the livestock breeders are combined into one. Fertilizer is the "grain" of grain, and animal husbandry is an important source of fertilizer. To have more and better fertilizer, there must be a large number of pigs, sheep, and large livestock. Therefore, while vigorously grasping grain production, they also grasped the development of animal husbandry, and put forward the slogan of "asking for fertilizer from animal husbandry." It was decided that Dong Yinbao, deputy secretary of the Party branch, would be in charge of animal husbandry and also serve as the captain of the fertilizer accumulation team. The original fertilizer accumulation team was disbanded, and the existing forty sheep workers and pig and sheep breeders in the area were concurrently in charge, realizing the integration of fertilizer accumulation and animal breeding. They also adopted the method of "determining livestock by people and determining fertilizer by livestock" and stipulated fertilizer quotas. The breeders and sheep workers are rewarded for exceeding the fertilizer accumulation task, provided that the quality of the fertilizer is not affected. The masses say that this has four major benefits: (1) further improving the enthusiasm of breeders for livestock breeding and fertilizer accumulation; (2) saving a large amount of manpower and directly participating in field production; (3) ensuring the continuous improvement of fertilizer quality and quantity; (4) facilitating the management area to plan and manage the use of fertilizer.

    Second, fertilizer accumulation and transportation are combined into one. In order to completely solve the contradiction of difficulty in transporting fertilizer and insufficient labor in mountainous areas, at the beginning of 1958, a comprehensive plan was made for fertilizer sources, and the effective method of "major innovation in the three pens and building fertilizer pits on the spot" was adopted. According to the fertilizer needs of abundant fields, ridges, and ditches, cattle farms, pig farms, and sheep farms were built on the spot. At the same time, according to the size of the plots and the adjacent conditions of the plots, 412 fertilizer pits were built at the head of the fields. In this way, the labor used for fertilizer transportation alone is reduced by about 20,000 each year.

    Third, slope repair and fertilizer smoking are combined into one. Here, slopes and trees are repaired every spring and autumn, but in the past, slopes were repaired only for slope repair, regardless of fertilizer accumulation. If tree branches and neck shoots cut down from repairing slopes were used to smoke fertilizer, the team had to send additional people. After the comprehensive utilization of labor, the tree repairers are the fertilizer smokers. They smoke the tree branches and neck shoots that are repaired into uncultivated fertilizer nearby, which increases fertilizer and saves labor.

      Equal Emphasis on Accumulation and Management, Improving Quality
    While vigorously grasping fertilizer accumulation, they also paid great attention to the management of fertilizer. If organic matter is not decomposed, composted, and matured by microorganisms, no matter how much fertilizer there is, crops cannot absorb and utilize it. Based on this principle, the Party branch of Lingdong Management Area paid attention to strengthening fertilizer management while accumulating fertilizer. Led by Cheng Xilong, the secretary of the Party branch, they absorbed the technical director Cheng Suogui and seven veteran farmers to form a fertilizer accumulation technical guidance committee and trained thirty-four technicians. Each production team also formed a fertilizer research group composed of two to three technicians to conduct key experiments and research on the characteristics, quality, management, and application of fertilizer. In this way, the previous practice of accumulating fertilizer without managing it was changed to equal emphasis on accumulation and management. The method is to grasp the characteristics and manage them separately: (1) Implement three turns and two pressures for composting fertilizer. The so-called "two pressures" means pressing straw in spring and artemisia in summer. Each time you press, you must mix a small amount of livestock fertilizer, so that it will ferment early. The so-called "three turns" means turning the pile three times in May, July, and August to mix the inside and outside to accelerate the decomposition of straw. (2) For livestock, pig, and sheep fertilizer, implement accumulation with turning, sealing when removed from the pen, removing the pen once every half month, turning the pen once a day, and padding the pen once. After removing the pen, pile it up in large piles, cover it with soil and mud to preserve moisture and temperature, accelerate decomposition, and reduce the loss of fertilizer effect. (3) For the uncultivated fertilizer smoked, try to smoke as much as possible. Generally, one jin of firewood smokes five jin of soil, and the smoking time must last at least about ten days. After the uncultivated fertilizer is smoked and the fire is extinguished, it should be compacted at any time, and applied as soon as it is opened to prevent fertilizer effect from flowing out. (4) For the livestock fertilizer picked up, all of them are mixed with soil, mixed with human fertilizer and urine, piled up and sealed for composting to improve fertilizer effect.

      Rational Use of Fertilizer, Maximizing Fertilizer Effect
    Fertilizer application is the most technical job. It is not only necessary to accumulate it well and manage it well, but also to use it well. How do they use it well? The main thing is to seize the season, find the law, and implement "eight wants and eight don'ts." These "eight wants and eight don'ts" are: want to apply mixed (mix slow-acting fertilizer and quick-acting fertilizer, mix organic fertilizer and inorganic fertilizer), don't apply alone; want to apply concentrated (apply in holes, apply in ditches), don't apply scattered; want to apply in layers, don't apply on the surface; want to apply separately as base fertilizer and topdressing fertilizer, don't apply at once; want to apply according to the land (according to soil performance), don't apply blindly; want to apply according to the time (according to the timing of crop sowing, jointing, booting, and grain filling), don't apply out of time; want to apply according to the crop, don't apply regardless of the crop; want to apply in appropriate amounts, don't apply too much or too little. Here, slow-acting fertilizers such as sheep fertilizer, horse fertilizer, cattle fertilizer, and soil fertilizer are generally used as base fertilizer, not as topdressing fertilizer; quick-acting fertilizers such as thatch fertilizer, pig fertilizer, sesame cake, bean cake, kang soil, road soil, smoked fertilizer, and chemical fertilizer are generally used as topdressing fertilizer.

    In terms of fertilizer application methods, this management area also paid special attention to applying sufficient base fertilizer, which is very important for increasing production. This year, 80% of their fertilizer was used as base fertilizer.

      Weak Links, Need to be Strengthened
    At present, in order to further implement the policy of vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain, through summarizing experience and reviewing the results of the battle, they have also found that there are still some problems in fertilizer work that need to be solved. These problems are:

    First, vigorously grasping the development of animal husbandry can further solve the source of fertilizer. However, the development speed of large livestock and pigs and sheep here is not fast enough, especially the development of pigs is even slower. To this end, the management area has made a plan to accelerate the development of animal husbandry in the new year, so that livestock fertilizer accounts for more than 70% of all fertilizers, becoming the basic fertilizer for farmland.

    Second, "three pens" to the field, building farms according to the field, this is a good way to solve the accumulation and transportation of fertilizer, but this must be based on rational layout and strengthened management to better play its role. To this end, they plan to: (1) The three pens (pig, sheep, and cattle pens) and the fertilizer pits at the head of the field will be comprehensively planned again by each production team to achieve one pit for three mu and one farm for one hundred mu. (2) The fertilizer pits at the head of the field are independently controlled by each production team, and the responsibility system is fully implemented.

    Third, the proportion of farm fertilizer and chemical fertilizer is somewhat unbalanced. Taking this year as an example, chemical fertilizer only accounts for 0.75% of the total amount of fertilizer applied, which seems too little. Therefore, they plan to build two more small chemical fertilizer plants.

    Fourth, at present, in the entire management area, except for the thirty-four technicians who have just entered the door, the science of fertilizer has not been mastered by the broad masses of commune members. Therefore, they plan to form more fertilizer research groups so that commune members can all understand the scientific knowledge of accumulating fertilizer, creating fertilizer, managing fertilizer, and applying fertilizer.

    Fifth, there is no complete written record of fertilizer application, which makes it difficult to scientifically summarize experience and continuously improve. Therefore, the management area has proposed that production teams establish a fertilizer use record system so that a comprehensive study can be made from it to obtain a more reliable and practical fertilizer application standard.

    肥料是增产粮食的基础
    ——山西陵川县古郊公社岭东管理区肥料工作调查
    中共陵川县委第一书记　邢德勇　书记处书记　张庆余、冯胜宝
    肥料是粮食的“粮食”。肥料多了，加上勤管巧用，再加上精耕细作，粮食产量就必然会连年上升。山西陵川古郊公社岭东管理区，由于近三年来大抓肥料，连年都是全县的粮食高产红旗单位。
    岭东管理区，历来号称“老东山”，北依王莽岭，南连马武山，四十八个大小山头绵延起伏，纵贯全境。全区共有三百一十户，一千二百零五口人。所种的两千六百四十亩耕地，大小就有一万一千多块，土层最厚的也不过一米多，最薄的仅为半尺多一点。解放前，每亩粮田最高年产量只平均百斤左右。在解放以后，特别是人民公社化以来，就在这同样的土地上，粮食产量连年增加。1957年全区的粮食总产较1949年增长一点四倍。1958年人民公社化以后，粮食总产量又比1957年增长30.9％。1959年虽然遭受了严重大旱，粮食总产量仍比大跃进的1958年增长2.7％。今年的庄稼又比去年长得好。
    在这石厚土薄的小块地上，能长出好庄稼，产量连年增加，主要是由于党的领导好，由于人民公社力量大，由于“八字宪法”贯彻执行的好。但在这个管理区还特别有一条，就是大抓肥料。
    解放前，这里的大牲口和猪羊等圈肥很少，每亩施肥量仅达三十担左右（一担均以百斤计，下同）。解放后，特别是在合作化的过程中，大牲口和猪羊增加了，积肥门路也大大开阔了，到1957年亩施肥料达到一百五十三担。1958年人民公社化后，施肥水平进一步提高了，全面实现了底一追二（即上底肥一次，追肥二次），亩施肥量增加到一百九十八担。1959年实现了“三圈”（大牲畜圈、猪圈、羊圈）大革新，就地设肥坑，积土肥和造化肥相结合，亩施肥量继续增加到二百三十四担。今年又实现了每户平均一点五头大牲口，每人平均一点三只羊，两户一口猪，再加上广大社员广开肥源，大积大造，亩施肥量比1959年又提高12％。    随着大牲口和猪羊的增加，积肥力量的加强和积造肥料技术的不断革新，肥料的质量也在不断提高。按照他们的划分标准和比较看：一等高质肥1957年占施肥总量的30.1％，今年占52. 1％；二等肥1957年占43. 3％，今年占41.8％；三等肥1957年占26.6％，今年占6.1％。
      广开肥源　积肥造肥
    “种地不上肥，就是胡打混”，这是农民几千年来积累的一条重要经验。但是，对于这一条，在1957年以前却没有引起他们的足够重视。当时不仅人工造肥很少，就是对于牲口猪羊的圈肥也很不注意，社员家庭积肥处于自流状态。几年来的教训，端正了人们的认识，管理区党支部从1958年春季开始，就在肥料上打过很多主意。他们经过不断研究，反复摸索，终于找到了“积、造、沤、熏、换（拆旧炕换新炕）、烧（烧柏油）、挖
  （挖茅底、井底、池底）、压（压青）、扫（路土）、拾（杂肥）”的十字积肥法，并做到了“三改八净”。三改是：改良畜圈、改良肥坑、改良茅坑。八净是：地净、场净、坡净、路净、院净、街净、碾道净、堎堰净。由于广开肥源，此后每年的积肥和施肥量年年增长。他们还根据季节转换、农活忙闲，找出积肥的规律，依照规律，采取了专业积肥和抓季节搞突击相结合的办法，所以肥料积得多，质量好。
    其次，在积肥中他们既抓集体，又抓个人。为了鼓励社员家庭积肥，他们采取了思想教育和物质鼓励相结合的办法。对重视家庭积肥并积极向社投资肥料的社员进行表扬，并实行了按质论价、现款收购和超额奖励的办法。为了解决社员向社交售和社员自留地施肥的矛盾，又普遍实行了“基本肥料制”，社员在交够基本肥料定额以外的部分，均可以自行处理。这样既便利了群众，又避免了集体与个人之间争肥的矛盾，使社员家庭积肥随着全区土地施肥总量的增长而节节向上。1957年社员家庭积肥仅为七万三千担，今年已达到二十万三千担，占全区全年施肥总量的23.5％。
    这里在大积自然肥的同时，又依靠群众，土法上马，建成了小型土化肥厂一座。土化肥厂除采用本地固有的熬硝办法，大量熬制卤水肥以外，并吸取了其它各地制造土化肥的经验，试制成功了尿素、骨粉、硫酸氨、柏叶化肥等多种土化肥。从去年到现在的一年多，已造出各种土化肥六万多斤。
      三圈到田　节省劳力
    肥料的潜力是无穷尽的，只要勤动手，到处都能有。但是随着肥料数量的增长，质量的提高，在劳动力的使用上就出现了一个大问题。1958年这个管理区积肥运肥的投工数即达四万四千多个，相当于一百四十多个劳力全年的工作量。而全区男女全半劳动力满打满算才二百二十六个，哪会有这样多的劳力来常年积肥运肥呢？为了解决这一问题，他们又采取了“因地制宜、合理布局，三大合一”的办法。这办法是：
    一、积肥专业队和牲畜饲养员合而为一。肥料是粮食的“粮食”，而畜牧业又是肥料的重要源泉。要有更多更好的肥料，就得有大量的猪、羊、大牲口。因而他们在大抓粮食生产的同时，又狠狠地抓住了畜牧业的发展，提出了“向畜牧业要肥料”的行动口号。确定支部副书记董银保专管畜牧业，并兼任积肥专业队队长。把原来组织的积肥专业队解散，由全区现有的四十个羊工和养猪、养羊的饲养员兼管，实现了积肥养畜合一。他们还采取了“以人定畜、以畜定肥”办法，规定积肥定额。饲养员、羊工在不影响肥料质量的原则下，超过积肥任务者给奖。群众说这样做有四大好处：（一）进一步提高了饲养员的养畜、积肥积极性；（二）节省了大批人力，直接参加了田间生产；（三）保证了肥料质量与数量的不断提高；（四）便于管理区有计划的管肥用肥。
    二、积肥运肥合而为一。为了彻底解决山区运肥困难和劳力不足的矛盾，1958年一开春，就对肥源进行了一次通盘规划，采取了“三圈大革新，就地建肥坑”的有效办法。根据丰产方、梁、沟的需肥情况，就地建成了养牛场、猪场和羊场。同时并根据地块的大小与地块的毗邻状况，建成了地头肥坑四百十二个。这样每年仅运肥一项用工就节省两万个左右。
    三、修坡与熏肥合而为一。在这里，每年春秋两季都要修坡、修树，但是，以往修坡的光修坡，不管积肥。如果用修坡砍下的树枝、脖稍熏肥，队里还得另外派人。在大搞劳力综合利用以后，修树人员就是熏肥人员，他们把修下的树枝、脖稍就近熏成荒肥，既增加了肥料，又节省了劳力。
      积管并重　提高质量
    这里在大抓积肥的同时，还十分注意肥料的管理。有机物质不经过微生物的分解沤制腐熟，肥料再多，庄稼还是不能吸收利用。岭东管理区党支部根据这个道理，在积肥当中就同时注意加强肥料管理。他们由支部书记程喜龙挂帅，吸收技术主任程锁贵以及技术老农等七人，组成了积肥技术指导委员会，并训练了技术员三十四人。每个生产小队也由二至三个技术员组成肥料研究小组，对肥料的特点、质量、管理、施用进行重点试验和研究。这样，就把以往的光积不管，变成了积管并重。其办法是掌握特点，分别管理：（一）对沤肥实行三翻两压。所谓“两压”，就是春压秸秆夏压蒿，每压一次都要掺杂少许牲口肥，这样便会提早发酵。所谓“三翻”，就是在5月、7月、8月三次翻堆，使内外混合加速秸秆腐熟。（二）对牲口猪羊肥实行随积随刨，出圈密封，每半个月除圈一次，每天刨圈一次，垫圈一次。在除圈以后，大堆堆积，盖土糊泥，以保存水分和温度，加速腐熟，减少肥效的丢失。（三）对于所熏的荒肥，要尽量多熏。一般是一斤柴禾熏五斤土，熏肥时间最少也要延续到十天左右。荒肥熏好灭火以后，要随时砸实，随开堆随施，以免肥效外流。（四）对于拾来的牲口肥，全部采用掺土、掺人肥尿，大堆密封沤制，提高肥效。
      合理用肥　发挥肥效
    施肥是技术性最强的活计，不仅要积好管好，而且还要用好。他们是如何做到用好呢？主要是抓季节、找规律、实行“八要八不要”。这“八要八不要”是：要混合施（迟效肥速效肥混合、有机肥无机肥混合），不要单一施；要集中施（穴施、沟施），不要分散施；要分层施，不要表面施；要分底肥、追肥分期施，不要一次施；要因地施（根据土壤性能），不要盲目施；要因时施（根据作物的播种、拔节、孕穗、灌浆等时机），不要失时施；要看作物施，不要不分作物施；要适量施，不要多施或少施。这里还做到羊肥、马肥、牛肥、土肥等迟效肥料，一般都作底肥，不作追肥；茅肥、猪肥、麻饼、豆饼、炕土、路土、熏肥、化肥等等速效肥料，一般作追肥用。
    在施用肥料方法上，这个管理区还特别注意了施足底肥，这对增产关系很大。今年他们80％的肥料都作了底肥。
      薄弱环节　有待加强
    目前，他们为了进一步贯彻执行大办农业、大办粮食的方针，通过总结经验，检阅战果，也发现了肥料工作中还有一些需要解决的问题。这些问题是：
    一、大抓畜牧业的发展，才能更进一步解决肥料来源。但这里的大牲口和猪羊的发展速度还不够快，其中尤其是猪的发展更慢。为此，管理区已经作出规划，要在新的一年中，加速发展畜牧业，使牲畜肥在全部肥料中占到70％以上，成为农田的基本肥料。
    二、“三圈”到田，依方建场，这是一条解决积肥、运肥的好办法，但这又必须在合理布局加强管理的前提下，才能更好地发挥作用。为此，他们计划：（一）对三圈（猪、羊、牛圈）与地头肥坑再由各生产小队作一次全面规划，做到三亩一坑，百亩一场。（二）地头肥坑由各生产小队自行支配，全面推行责任制。
    三、农家肥与化学肥的比重有些失调。就拿今年来看，化肥仅占施肥总量的0.75％，显得太少。因而他们计划再增建小型化肥厂两座。
    四、目前对于肥料这门科学，在全管理区除了三十四个技术员刚刚入门以外，还没有被广大社员群众所掌握。因而他们计划要组成更多的肥料研究小组，使社员都懂得积肥、造肥、管肥、施肥的科学知识。
    五、在肥料的施用上，还没有完整的文字记载，这就难于科学总结经验，不断提高。因之，管理区已经提出以生产小队建立用肥记录制度，以便从中再作全面研究，得出一套更可靠、更切合实际的施肥标准。
