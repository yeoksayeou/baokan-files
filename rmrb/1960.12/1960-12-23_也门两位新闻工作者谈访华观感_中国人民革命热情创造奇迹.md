Two articles recently published in the Yemeni newspaper *Al-Nasr* highly praised China's construction achievements. The authors are Mohammed Hussein Musa, editor-in-chief of *Al-Nasr*, and Mohammed Ghalib Mubanin, another member of the delegation, who both participated in a Yemeni journalist delegation's visit to China not long ago.

In his article, Musa said that he had the opportunity to see the progress China had made in the new era, the dreams that had been realized in China, and the countless projects, buildings, colleges, and factories that the Chinese people had diligently built in various important aspects. These were all built very well, perfectly, and admirably, and in a very short time.

The article pointed out, "It is worth mentioning that we were warmly welcomed and received everywhere. Undoubtedly, this shows the friendly feelings of the Chinese people towards the Yemeni people, and the Yemeni people also have the same good feelings based on genuine and honest cooperation with the Chinese people."

The article talked about the Chinese people's enthusiastic celebration of National Day, saying, "The Chinese people are all delighted with their country's excellent achievements in all aspects, and with the Great Leap Forward in workshops, factories, cities, and rural people's communes." The article emphasized, "This scene clearly illustrates the unity, cooperation, and solidarity of the Chinese people around their leaders to build their country."

Another article written by Mubanin stated that the progress China has made in construction, economy, military, culture, agriculture, health, and society in these few years shows that China is leaping forward rapidly.

The article said, "Indeed, wishes alone are not enough to create miracles; money cannot accomplish great undertakings either. But these miracles are created by the great revolutionary drive and enthusiasm of the Chinese people."

    也门两位新闻工作者谈访华观感
    中国人民革命热情创造奇迹
    最近一期也门《胜利报》刊载了两篇文章，盛赞中国的建设成就。文章的作者是不久前参加也门新闻工作者代表团访问过中国的《胜利报》主编穆罕默德·侯赛因·穆萨和代表团另一位团员穆罕默德·加利卜·穆巴宁。
    穆萨在文章中说，他有机会看到中国在新时代中取得的进展，在中国已经实现的梦想，中国人民努力在各个重要方面修建的无数工程、建筑、学院和工厂，这些都建造得非常优良、完善和令人钦佩，而且修建的时间很短。
    文章指出，“值得一提的是，我们到处受到热烈的欢迎和招待。无疑，这表明中国人民对也门人民的友好感情，也门人民也怀有基于同中国人民真正的、正直的合作的同样的良好感情。”
    文章谈到中国人民热烈庆祝国庆的情况说，“中国人民都对自己国家在一切方面的优良成就，对车间、工厂、城市和农村人民公社的大跃进感到欢欣鼓舞”。文章强调说，“这种景象清楚地说明中国人民的团结一致、合作和他们团结在他们领袖的周围来建设他们的国家。”
    穆巴宁所写另一篇文章说，这几年内，中国在建设、经济、军事、文化、农业、卫生和社会方面所取得的进展，说明中国正在迅速跃进。
    文章说，“的确，光是愿望不足以产生奇迹；金钱也不能完成伟大的事业。但是这些奇迹是中国人民伟大的革命动力和热情所创造的。”
