    Aunt Ding Knits Net Bags
    On the third floor of "Small World" in Shanghai's Old City God Temple, a group of women knitting net bags surrounds a spirited old woman. Some ask her to teach the quick shuttle method, others ask her to teach the new knitting method. This old woman is named Ding Wending, a housewife from the neighborhood, and now serves as the technical instructor for the net bag production group of the City God Temple neighborhood committee. There's a story about how she joined the net bag production group.
    Aunt Ding saw that there were many customers buying net bags in the City God Temple's stores, and some people couldn't buy them immediately. She went to inquire and learned that these net bags were purchased from Suzhou and other places. The neighborhood committee was planning to establish a net bag production group, but couldn't find a skilled knitter.
    Aunt Ding remembered that she had knitted hairnets when she was a young woman forty years ago. Isn't knitting hairnets the same as knitting net bags? So she bought a net bag and three pounds of yarn, and tried to knit one by following its example. For several days, the old woman knitted and undid, undid and knitted, and finally knitted a decent net bag. When the neighborhood committee learned of this, they immediately invited Aunt Ding to be the technical instructor for the net bag production group. Now, this group has more than fifty women, producing three hundred dozen net bags a month, with the same style and quality as those produced in Suzhou. The supply of net bags in the City God Temple market is now more abundant.

    丁妈妈结网袋
    上海老城隍庙“小世界”三楼上，有一群结网线袋的妇女围着一个精神饱满的老妈妈。有的要她教快速穿梭法，有的要她教新式编结法。这位老妈妈叫丁文定，是附近的一个家庭妇女，现在担任了城隍庙里弄委员会网袋生产小组的技术指导。说起她参加网袋生产小组，还有一段故事。
    丁妈妈看到城隍庙的商店里，买网袋的顾客很多，有的人一时买不到。她跑去一打听，才知道这种网袋是向苏州等地采购来的。里弄委员会正打算成立一个网袋生产组，就是找不到一个会编结的熟手。
    丁妈妈想起自己四十年前做姑娘的时候，曾经编结过发网。结发网和结网袋不是一样吗？于是她就去买了一只网袋和三斤纱线，照着试编起来。一连好几天，老妈妈编了拆，拆了编，终于编出一只像样的网袋。里弄委员会知道这个消息，立即请丁妈妈当网袋生产小组的技术指导。现在，这个组有五十多个妇女，一个月生产三百打网袋，式样、质量和苏州产的一样。城隍庙市场供应的网袋更加充裕了。
