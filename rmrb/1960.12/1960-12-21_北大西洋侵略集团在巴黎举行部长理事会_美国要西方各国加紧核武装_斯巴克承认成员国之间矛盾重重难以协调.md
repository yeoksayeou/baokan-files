Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 19th: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Ministerial Council concluded on the 18th after holding a three-day meeting. The revealed proceedings of the meeting and the final communiqué issued once again demonstrated the aggressive nature of this group. The United States representatives at the meeting made every effort to drive the member states of this aggressive military bloc, pieced together by the U.S., to follow the U.S. in expanding armaments and preparing for war, especially accelerating nuclear armaments, and to build this group into a so-called "fourth atomic power."

U.S. Secretary of State Herter proposed a plan at the beginning of the meeting to accelerate the arming of NATO forces with nuclear missiles. According to this plan, the United States will provide its NATO "allies" with five nuclear submarines each equipped with sixteen "Polaris" intermediate-range missiles in 1963. By 1964, Western European countries will spend money to purchase another one hundred intermediate-range missiles from the United States to strengthen nuclear armaments. Herter also guaranteed that the United States will continue to store some of its nuclear weapons in Western Europe in the future as part of NATO's "deterrent force."

Herter also strongly advocated at the meeting to strengthen the conventional military equipment of this group. In this regard, the communiqué stated that, in addition to nuclear weapons, "the Council unanimously agreed that it is equally important to strengthen the defense capabilities of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in other aspects." The communiqué stated that "the nuclear and conventional forces of the Alliance must maintain an appropriate balance to provide the necessary flexibility."

In a statement summarizing the work of the meeting after the meeting, Herter pointed out that "one of the most important issues discussed at this meeting was the long-term (arms expansion and war preparation) plan of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." He said that this organization "is engaged in important long-term planning to determine how it can most effectively achieve its major military and non-military goals in the future."

In order to conceal the aggressive and bellicose face of NATO, the meeting communiqué, under a series of hypocritical slogans such as NATO seeking "peace," "hoping to resume negotiations at an early date," and "respecting national independence," reiterated that the West continues to adhere to the position of wanting supervision without disarmament on the disarmament issue. On the West Berlin issue, the communiqué reiterated the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's declaration of December 16, 1958, once again stating that the West will continue to赖 [lài; to rely on; to depend on; to hang around] in West Berlin, oppose the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and resolutely maintain the abnormal state of West Berlin.

The communiqué did not specify the extent to which agreement was reached on the U.S. plan to turn NATO into a "fourth nuclear power" and what measures would be taken to implement the U.S. plan. According to Reuters reporter Earl, apart from the West Germans, who "seemed the most enthusiastic," the U.S. plan "failed to receive very enthusiastic support from all European allies." Some European countries were happy to have five U.S. nuclear submarines at their disposal at no cost, but rejected the U.S.'s further suggestion to sell them one hundred intermediate-range missiles.

It is reported that the British side is worried that the establishment of NATO's nuclear force under the U.S. plan will weaken Britain's power in the region as the only Western European country with nuclear weapons. It is particularly afraid that West Germany will therefore achieve nuclear armament through the back door and further compete with Britain for hegemony in Western Europe. The French side is concerned that the implementation of the U.S. proposal will subordinate itself to the United States, which will affect the efforts of the de Gaulle government to develop France's "independent nuclear force" in order to enhance France's status. According to the meeting communiqué, the meeting finally decided to hand over the U.S. plan and "related issues" to the permanent representatives for "detailed discussion and research."

The meeting communiqué also mentioned the issue of strengthening "political consultations" among the member states of the group, which also reflects the increasingly sharp contradictions between the NATO countries. It was revealed that British Foreign Secretary Home expressed concern in his speech about the exclusion of British influence by the six "Common Market" countries in Western Europe. France continues to vie for equal footing with the United States and Britain in NATO, and proposed reorganizing NATO's naval headquarters and establishing an Iberian Peninsula naval headquarters commanded by a Frenchman. Belgian Foreign Minister Wigny complained that the United States excluded Belgian colonial forces in the Congo. Even NATO Secretary-General Spaak had to admit at a press conference today that, in the face of numerous contradictions among the member states, it is "not easy" to achieve "coordination in views and consistency in actions" among the member states, because "experience has proven that this coordination of views among the North Atlantic countries is not always achieved."

The meeting communiqué stated that the next meeting of the NATO Council will be held in Oslo in May next year to continue discussions on various issues facing the group.

### 北大西洋侵略集团在巴黎举行部长理事会  美国要西方各国加紧核武装  斯巴克承认成员国之间矛盾重重难以协调

    北大西洋侵略集团在巴黎举行部长理事会
    美国要西方各国加紧核武装
    斯巴克承认成员国之间矛盾重重难以协调
    据新华社巴黎19日电　北大西洋集团部长理事会在举行了三天会议后已经在18日结束。透露出来的会议进程和会议发表的最后公报，再一次表明了这个集团的侵略本性。美国代表在会上竭力驱使它拼凑的这个侵略性军事集团的成员国，追随美国扩军备战，特别是加紧核武装，要把这个集团建成所谓“第四原子力量”。
    美国国务卿赫脱在会议一开始就提出了一项加紧用核导弹来武装北大西洋集团军队的计划。根据这项计划，美国在1963年将向它的北大西洋集团“盟国”提供五艘各装备有十六枚“北极星”式中程导弹的核潜艇，到1964年再由西欧国家出钱向美国购买另外一百枚中程导弹以加强核武装。赫脱还保证：美国今后将继续把它的一些核武器存放在西欧，以作为北大西洋集团的“威慑力量”的一部分。
    赫脱在会上还大力鼓吹要加强这个集团的常规军备。在这方面，公报说，除了核武器以外，“理事会一致认为，在其他方面加强北大西洋公约组织的防御力量也是同样重要的。”公报说，“联盟部队的核力量和常规力量必须保持适当的平衡，以提供必要的灵活性”。
    赫脱在会议结束后发表关于总结会议工作的一项声明中指出，这次会议“所讨论的问题中最重要的一项，是北大西洋公约组织的长期（扩军备战）计划”。他说，这个组织“正在从事重要的长期规划，以决定它怎样才能最有效地达到它今后在军事和非军事方面的重大目标”。
    为了掩盖北大西洋集团的侵略和好战面目，会议公报在所谓北大西洋集团谋求“和平”，“希望早日恢复谈判”和“尊重民族独立”等一连串伪善口号下，重新强调在裁军问题上，西方继续坚持要监督不要裁军的立场。在西柏林问题上，公报重申北大西洋公约组织1958年12月16日的声明，再一次表示西方要继续赖在西柏林，反对缔结对德和约，坚决要保持西柏林的不正常状态。
    对于美国的变北大西洋集团为“第四核力量”的计划，公报没有说明，究竟在多大程度上取得了协议以及采取什么措施来实现美国的计划。据路透社记者厄尔报道，对于美国的这项计划，除了西德人“显得最热心”之外，“未能得到全体欧洲盟国十分热情的支持”。一些欧洲国家乐于不付任何代价地把五艘美国核潜艇交它们支配，但是拒绝美国要卖给它们一百枚中程导弹的进一步建议。
    据报道，英国方面担心，根据美国计划建立北大西洋集团的核力量，将削弱作为西欧唯一拥有核武器的国家英国在这个地区的势力。它特别害怕西德会因此而从后门实现核武装，进一步在西欧同英国争霸。而法国方面则担心，实现美国的建议会使自己从属于美国，从而将影响戴高乐政府为抬高法国地位而发展法国的“独立核力量”的努力。据会议公报说，会议最后决定把美国的计划以及“有关问题”通通交给常驻代表“详细讨论研究”。
    会议公报还谈到加强集团各成员国之间的“政治磋商”的问题，这也反映了北大西洋集团国家之间的矛盾日益尖锐化。据透露，英国外交大臣霍姆在发言时对西欧大陆六国“共同市场”排斥英国的势力表示不安。法国继续在争夺在北大西洋集团中同美、英平起平坐的地位，并且提出了改组北大西洋公约组织的海军司令部，设立一个由法国人指挥的伊比利亚半岛海军司令部的建议。比利时外交大臣维尼抱怨美国在刚果排斥比利时殖民势力。甚至北大西洋集团秘书长斯巴克今天在记者招待会上也不得不承认，在各成员国矛盾重重的情况下，要达到各成员国的“观点上的协调和行动上的一致”是“不容易”的，因为“经验证明，这种北大西洋国家间观点的协调并不经常实现”。
    会议公报说，北大西洋集团理事会下次会议将在明年5月在奥斯陆举行，继续就这个集团面临的各项问题进行讨论。
