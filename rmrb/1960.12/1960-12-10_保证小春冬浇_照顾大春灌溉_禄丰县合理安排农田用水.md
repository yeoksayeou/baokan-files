    Ensuring Winter Irrigation for Early Spring Crops, Taking Care of Irrigation for Major Spring Crops
    Lufeng County Rationally Arranges Farmland Water Use
    (Our dispatch) Yunnan's Lufeng County, with a forward-thinking spirit, rationally arranges water use for early spring irrigation. They strive to both fully satisfy the water needs of early spring crops and conserve water, preparing for major spring irrigation next year.
    Lufeng County's more than 5,000 ponds, dams, and reservoirs have mostly closed for the winter, and the water volume has increased compared to last year. They have also used water-retaining dams and winter paddy fields to store some water. The county party committee recently put forward the requirement of "using one mu of water as two mu, and making every effort to tap the potential of natural water," and led the communes to make scientific arrangements for early spring water use, to ensure that they can both meet the needs of early spring irrigation as much as possible and reserve more water for major spring next year. The measures they have taken are: First, use long-flowing streams and water stored in river-blocking dams, winter paddy fields, and groundwater (well water), because most of this water will be lost if it is not used; then use water stored in small ponds, small dams, shallow ponds, and shallow dams that are not easy to store, because the ponds are small, and if they are not used in early spring, a lot of them will evaporate when major spring needs them; reservoirs and large dams with large storage capacity and large benefit areas are easy to preserve, and are generally not used to irrigate early spring. When it is absolutely necessary, a part of it can be taken out to supplement early spring water use.
    All communes have conducted a ranking and accounting, and formulated water use plans, trying to save water as much as possible. Dunren Commune has a total of 149 large and small long-flowing streams. Calculated over two months, they can irrigate 7,084 mu of early spring crops; 350 river-blocking dams store water that can irrigate 12,446 mu of early spring crops; and the water stored in 622 small ponds and small dams that are not easy to store is also used to irrigate early spring crops. In this way, of the 37,887 mu of early spring crops in all production teams in the entire commune, all but the more than 6,200 mu that are inconvenient to irrigate due to geographical conditions can be irrigated. The water in the remaining reservoirs and large dams can be left unused, and all of it can be reserved for major spring use. At the same time, starting from January, while using the river-blocking dams, the unused long-flowing streams can be accumulated to further increase the water for major spring. Nanping Management Area of Luochuan Commune, based on the favorable conditions of many natural springs in the mountainous area, first used spring water and water stored in winter paddy fields, and then used water stored in 38 river-blocking dams, leaving all 79,000 cubic meters of stored water in nine ponds and dams for major spring use. Caiyun Management Area of this commune took advantage of the current abundance of groundwater and dug nine hanging ponds to draw water to irrigate rape. During irrigation, all communes insisted on shallow irrigation from the beginning of watering early spring crops. Generally, they ensured that the water wet the soil evenly without overflowing, and used ladles to water when all four ditches had water. This avoids excessive flooding affecting the growth of early spring seedlings and saves water. Commune members of Luochuan Commune generally reflected that: "This year's approach ensures that early spring crops have enough water; otherwise, the ponds will be emptied once or twice, and when the mountain streams have less water, there will be no water in the ponds. Not to mention that there will be no water for major spring, even the water for early spring will not be guaranteed."

    保证小春冬浇　照顾大春灌溉
    禄丰县合理安排农田用水
    本报讯　云南禄丰县各人民公社以瞻前顾后的精神，合理安排小春灌溉用水，尽量做到既保证小春饮饱喝足，又节约用水，为明年大春灌溉做好准备。
    禄丰县的五千多塘坝、水库，大部分已关了冬水，水量比去年增加，还利用拦水坝和冬水田关了一部分水。县委最近提出了“一亩水当两亩用，千方百计挖掘自然水潜力”的要求，并且领导各公社对小春用水作出科学安排，以保证既尽量满足小春灌水需要，又为明年大春多储备一些水。他们采取的办法是：先用长流水和拦河坝、冬水田里蓄的水，以及地下水（井水），因为这部分水不用也会大部分流失；再用不易保蓄的小水塘、小坝、浅塘、浅坝的蓄水，这部分水塘因为塘小，如果小春不用，到大春需用时也会蒸发不少；蓄水量多而受益面积大的水库、大坝塘里的水，易于保存，一般不用来润小春，十分必要时，可以拿出一部分来补足小春用水。
    各公社都进行了排队算账，订出用水计划，尽可能地节约用水。敦仁公社各队共有大小长流水一百四十九股，以两个月计算可灌小春七千零八十四亩；拦河坝三百五十道，蓄的水可以灌小春一万二千四百四十六亩；又把六百二十二个不易保蓄的小塘小坝的蓄水也利用起来灌溉小春。这样，全公社各生产队三万七千八百八十七亩小春，除因为地理条件不便浇灌的六千二百多亩以外，都可以得到浇灌。其余的水库、大坝塘中的水可以不用，全部留作大春用水。同时，从1月起，利用拦河坝边用边蓄，再把浇灌小春用不完的长流水积起来，还可再增加大春用水。罗川公社的南平管理区根据山区自然泉水多的有利条件，先用泉水和冬水田蓄的水，再用三十八道拦河坝蓄的水，把九个塘坝的七万九千多立方米蓄水全部留作大春用水。这个公社的彩云管理区趁目前地下水多，挖了吊塘九个，提水润油菜。在浇灌时，各公社一开始给小春灌水就坚持浅水浇灌，一般都做到了水润平墒不润满墒，四沟都有水时就用瓢浇。这样做既避免了淹水过多影响小春幼苗成长，又节约了水。罗川公社的社员普遍反映说：今年这样做，小春泡水有把握了；不然，一次两次就把塘子放光，到箐水少的时候塘子里也没水了，莫说是没有大春用水，就连小春用水也没有保证。
