Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 25th. It was announced here today that the Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Pham Van Dong, sent a letter to the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina. The letter points out the seriousness of the current situation in Laos and suggests that a meeting of the participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference be convened immediately, and that the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos be resumed. The full text of the letter is as follows:

The Right Honorable Mr. Home, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom,
The Honorable Mr. Gromyko, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,
Your Excellencies,

The current situation in Laos is particularly serious. A source of war that seriously threatens the peace and security of the peoples of Indochina and Southeast Asia has emerged. The profound root and direct cause of this situation is the direct interference of U.S. imperialism in the internal affairs of the Kingdom of Laos, attempting to turn Laos into a U.S. military base in preparation for launching a new war, trampling on the Geneva Agreements on Laos, and hindering the legitimate government of Laos headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma from pursuing a policy of peaceful neutrality and national harmony. U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in Thailand and South Vietnam have given full military assistance to the Phoumi-Nosavan rebel elements. They have directly participated in military activities against the government of Prince Souvanna Phouma, attempting to overthrow this government and establish a puppet government as a docile tool of U.S. imperialism's aggressive policy. Just as the rebel elements were launching an attack on Vientiane, the capital of the Kingdom of Laos, the United States and its followers had engaged in extremely blatant interference.

The above actions are extremely serious violations of the Geneva Agreements, especially Article 12 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference on Indochina: "Each participating country of the Geneva Conference, in relation to Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, undertakes to respect the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of the aforementioned countries, and to refrain from any interference in their internal affairs."

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, in its statement of December 17, 1960, regarding the situation in Laos, expressed deep concern about the changes taking place in its neighboring country of Laos. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has stated its position that the current tense situation in Laos must and can only be resolved on the basis and within the scope of the Geneva Agreements. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that it is necessary and urgent for the participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference to reconvene and for the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos to be resumed.

At present, the war in Laos is in danger of spreading. U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in Thailand and South Vietnam are intensifying their interference in Laos, and the aggressive forces of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization are preparing for large-scale intervention. Any delay in resolving the Laotian issue will have unfortunate consequences for the peace and security of Indochina and Southeast Asian countries.

Faced with the increasingly deteriorating situation in Laos, I, in the name of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as a signatory to the Geneva Agreements on Laos, solemnly propose that the two chairmen immediately convene a meeting of the participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference and resume the activities the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos, as stipulated in Article 25 of the Decision on the Cessation of Hostilities in Laos.

I hope that the two chairmen will promptly take the measures mentioned above in order to extinguish the flames of war in Laos, stop the aggression of U.S. imperialism and its allies against the Kingdom of Laos, stabilize the situation in Laos, and protect the basic national rights of the Laotian people.

I extend my highest respects to Your Excellencies.

Pham Van Dong
Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
December 24, 1960, in Hanoi

    范文同总理要求日内瓦会议两位主席采取措施
    制止美国侵略　稳定老挝局势
    建议立即召开日内瓦会议参加国会议和恢复老挝国际委员会活动
    新华社河内25日电　此间今天公布了越南民主共和国外交部部长范文同给1954年讨论关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议两位主席的信。信中指出老挝目前局势的严重性，并建议立即召开1954年日内瓦会议参加国的会议和恢复老挝国际监察和监督委员会的活动。信件全文如下：大不列颠联合王国外交大臣霍姆先生苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟外交部部长葛罗米柯先生两位主席先生，
    老挝目前的局势是特别严重的。一个严重威胁印度支那和东南亚各族人民和平与安全的战争策源地已经出现了。造成这一局势的深远根源及其直接原因是由于美帝国主义直接干涉老挝王国内政，企图把老挝变成美国的一个军事基地，准备发起一次新的战争，蹂躏关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，并阻挠以梭发那·富马亲王为首相的老挝合法政府实行和平中立、民族和睦的政策。美帝国主义和它在泰国和南越的走狗，曾经对富米—文翁叛乱分子全力给予军事上的援助，它们已直接参与了反对梭发那·富马亲王政府的军事活动，企图推翻这个政府，并建立一个作为美帝国主义侵略政策的驯服工具的傀儡政府。正当叛乱分子向老挝王国首都万象发起进攻的时候，美国及其仆从已作了极其明目张胆的干涉。
    上述行动极其严重地违反日内瓦协议，特别是关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的最后宣言的第十二条：“日内瓦会议的每个与会国家在对柬埔寨、老挝和越南三国的关系上，保证尊重上述各国的主权、独立、统一和领土完整，并对其内政不予任何干涉。”
    越南民主共和国政府1960年12月17日关于老挝局势的声明中，曾经对自己的邻国老挝所发生的变化表示深切忧虑。越南民主共和国政府曾经表明自己的立场是，老挝目前的紧张局势必须而且只能够在日内瓦协议的基础上和范围内加以解决。越南民主共和国政府认为1954年日内瓦会议参加国重新举行会议和恢复老挝国际监察和监督委员会的活动是必要的和迫切的。
    目前，老挝战争有正在蔓延的危机，美帝国主义和它在泰国和南越的走狗正在加紧干涉老挝，东南亚军事集团的侵略势力正在准备进行大规模干涉。在解决老挝问题中不论任何迟缓，都将会给印度支那和东南亚各国的和平和安全带来不幸的后果。
    面临老挝局势正在日益恶化的情况，我以作为签订关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议一方的越南民主共和国政府的名义，郑重建议两位主席立即召开1954年日内瓦会议参加国的会议和恢复老挝国际监察和监督委员会的活动，正如关于老挝停止敌对行动决定第二十五条所规定的那样。
    我希望两位主席要迅速采取上述所提出的措施，以便扑灭老挝战争的火焰，阻止美帝国主义和它的同盟国对老挝王国的侵略，稳定老挝局势，以保障老挝人民的基本民族权利。
    我谨向两位主席致以最高敬意
    越南民主共和国外交部部长    范文同
                　1960年12月24日于河内
