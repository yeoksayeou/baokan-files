  Cutting through thorns and brambles,
  Climbing clouds and crossing mists, we follow the footprints of wild boars, for the sake of everyone walking on broad roads. How many shovels have been broken, how many steel axes have been split, what does it matter if there are more, the reclamation team has plenty of iron smelters! The shovels become more pure and hard with each strike, the steel axes become more solid with each strike; the calluses on our hands become more firm, we use sweat as ink to write poems. From afar, the mountains are high and the forests are dense and serene, a closer look reveals red flags dancing deep in the white clouds, what is that red-walled, green-tiled place? The illustrious name is “Reclamation Mansion.”
    Two
  No need to open your eyes, no need to stick out your tongue, pumpkins may be large but they can climb trees, carp climbing mountains are not strange, there is an artificial lake on the mountaintop. Yellow cattle fill the mountains but do not plow the fields, fresh milk flows like a river; sparrows fly from thousands of miles away, the mountains are full of rice paddies. Otters are raised so tame, and even feed fat wild boars, without the breeder’s introduction, you might mistake the chicken coop for a bed. A fertilizer factory has been built, its chimney is like a pillar reaching the sky; a chemical factory is about to be completed, it will weave silk brocade like a waterfall.

  If you ask for the reclamation team’s address, Daqingshan is the post office; welcome to visit, you can stay for a long time if you like. Parents send their sons, wives send their husbands; “Come and pick us up soon!” This is the common request. Painters come and forget to paint, standing on the mountaintop and raising their arms in a shout: students come and forget to go home, busy writing applications to find the branch secretary. People have so many beautiful ideals, the happiest thing is to embark on the long road of struggle; ah, we follow the footprints of wild boars, for the sake of everyone walking on broad roads.

    大青山垦荒队
    柯炽
    一披荆斩棘，
  登云跨雾，我们沿着野猪足迹走，为的大家走大路。挖断多少洋铲，劈断多少钢斧，再多一些又何妨呀，垦荒队有的是炼铁炉！洋铲越打越纯硬，钢斧越打越牢固；手茧越起越结实啊，汗珠当墨写诗书。远看山高林密静悠悠，细看白云深处红旗舞，红墙绿瓦是何处？赫赫大名“垦荒府”。
    二不必睁眼不必把舌吐，南瓜虽大能上树，鲤鱼上山不为怪呀，山顶出了人工湖。黄牛满山不犁田，鲜奶流如注；麻雀千里飞来了，山山是稻谷。水獭养得多纯熟，还喂头头肥野猪，不是饲养员的介绍，会把鸡屋做卧铺。化肥厂建起来，烟囱好似顶天柱；化工厂快落成，要织绸锦似瀑布。
  三若问垦荒队的住址，大青山便是通讯处；欢迎你们来参观，喜欢的可以来长住。父母送来儿子，妻子送来丈夫；“去了快来接我们呀！”这是共同的嘱咐。画家来了忘画画，站在山头振臂高呼：学生来了忘回家，忙写申请找支书。人们有多少美好的理想，最幸福的是踏上斗争长途；啊，我们沿着野猪足迹走，为的大家走大路。
