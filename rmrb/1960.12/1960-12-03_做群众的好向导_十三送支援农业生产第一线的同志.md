    Be a Good Guide for the Masses
    -- Thirteenth Send-off to Comrades Supporting the Agricultural Production Frontline
    Ge Song
    Chairman Mao said: "The revolutionary party is the guide of the masses." ("Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society") Party cadres should resolutely implement the Party's class line and the Party's policies. This is the glorious duty of every comrade who goes to the forefront of agricultural production, and it is also a fundamental guarantee for changing the face of the countryside and winning the great march towards agriculture.
    Comrades going to the countryside, you will personally feel the excellent situation in the countryside and the infinite power of the Three Red Banners. You will also personally experience that the flames of class struggle have not been extinguished. The struggle between the two roads is still frequently reflected in various rural tasks. This struggle is manifested not only in politics and production but also permeates all aspects of rural life. Building rural people's communes and developing agricultural production, in some places, is not only a struggle against nature but also a matter of adhering to the struggle between the two roads. Therefore, who to rely on, who to unite with, and who to strike at must be clarified first when going to the countryside. This concerns whether the socialist revolution can be carried through to the end and whether socialist construction can develop rapidly.
    The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants say: "The Three Red Banners are very good!" "The People's Communes are very good!" "Public canteens are very good!" "The three-level ownership system based on the team is very good!" Some well-to-do middle peasants' answers are the opposite: "Terrible..." Whose opinion do you listen to regarding such opposite opinions? Do you enthusiastically support the former or secretly agree with the latter? This is a test and exercise of the revolutionary steadfastness of every comrade who goes to the forefront of agricultural production. In the struggle between the two roads, it is necessary to stand clearly on one side and be brave in the struggle. The interests of the revolution require you to use the courage and wisdom that a working-class fighter should have, firmly stand on the side of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, firmly rely on them, establish their advantages, enhance their morale, and extinguish the prestige of capitalist spontaneous forces. Because only they are the reliable allies of the Party and the working class in the countryside. Only by fully mobilizing their enthusiasm for production, resolutely striking at the remnants of feudal forces and constantly fighting against various reflections of bourgeois ideology, can production be successful and all rural work be done well. Every comrade who goes to the countryside can only be effective in their work if they unswervingly implement the Party's class line; if they deviate from it, they will lose their way and go astray.
    An article published on page 8 of the November 22nd People's Daily, "Old He Arrives at 'Xiao Geng's Home'" is a good example. Comrade He Wenjie, a brigade party secretary, because he adhered to the Party's class line, resolutely relied on the poor and lower-middle peasants, united the broad masses, and carried out a tit-for-tat struggle with a few bad elements in the local area, the production team of Xiao Gengjia changed its backward state, production changed from deserted to vigorous, and it jumped from a backward team to an advanced team.
    In the current tens of millions of production teams in rural areas, although the bad elements like Geng Jingyi of Xiao Gengjia are extremely few, they are not unique. Some class enemies are very well hidden, but they are not asleep. As long as there is an opportunity, a gap to exploit, they will make trouble, harm the masses, and sabotage production. We must be vigilant and resolutely strike at them! The capitalist spontaneous forces in the countryside are also unwilling to be eliminated and will come out whenever they have the opportunity. As soon as they come out, we should resolutely struggle against them. One more point is also very important: those hostile thoughts and actions are not expressed directly but often through hidden and tortuous forms. Everything must be analyzed and thought about from a class point of view, and simplification must not be allowed. Our victory today comes from struggle. Tomorrow's greater victory must also be developed from struggle. Only by adhering to the Party's class line and adhering to the struggle between the two roads can we be good guides for the masses and build rural people's communes better.

    做群众的好向导
    ——十三送支援农业生产第一线的同志
    戈松
    毛主席说过：“革命党是群众的向导”。（《中国社会各阶级的分析》）党的干部，应当坚决贯彻党的阶级路线和党的方针政策。这是每个走向农业生产第一线的同志的光荣职责，也是改变农村面貌，向农业大进军取得胜利的根本保证。
    到农村去的同志们，你们会亲身感受到当前农村的大好形势，感受到三面红旗的无穷威力。你们也会亲身体会到：阶级斗争的火焰并没有熄灭。在农村各项工作中还经常会反映出两条道路的斗争。这种斗争，既表现在政治上、生产上，也渗透在农村生活的各个方面。建设农村人民公社，发展农业生产，在某些地方说来，不仅是向大自然作斗争，而且也是坚持两条道路斗争的问题。因此，到农村去，依靠谁？团结谁？打击谁？都必须首先弄清楚。这是关系着是否把社会主义革命进行到底，能否使社会主义建设飞速向前发展的问题。
    广大的贫农、下中农说：“三面红旗好得很！”“人民公社好得很！”“公共食堂好得很！”“队为基础的三级所有制好得很！”有些富裕中农的回答则相反：“糟……”诸如此类的相反议论，你听谁的？是热烈拥护前者呢？还是暗暗赞成后者？这是对每一个到农业生产第一线去的同志的革命坚定性的考验和锻炼。在两条道路的斗争中，要明确地站在一边，要勇于斗争。革命的利益，要求你以一个工人阶级战士应有的勇敢和机智，坚定地站到广大贫农和下中农一边，坚决依靠他们，树立他们的优势，长他们的志气，灭资本主义自发势力的威风。因为只有他们才是党和工人阶级在农村中可靠的同盟者。只有充分地把他们的生产积极性调动起来，坚决打击封建残余势力并和资产阶级思想的各种反映进行不断斗争，生产才能搞得好，农村一切工作才能做得好。每个到农村去的同志，只有坚定不移地贯彻党的阶级路线，工作才有成效；离开了它，就会迷失方向，走入歧途。
    11月22日《人民日报》八版刊载的一篇文章：《老贺到了“小耿家”》是个好的例证。一位大队支部书记贺文杰同志，由于坚持了党的阶级路线，坚决依靠贫农和下中农，团结广大群众，同当地少数坏分子进行了针锋相对的斗争，小耿家这个生产队才改变了落后面貌，生产上由冷冷清清变为蓬蓬勃勃，由落后队一跃而为先进队。
    在目前农村数以千万计的生产队里，像小耿家耿景宜那样的坏分子，虽然是极少的，但也不是独一无二的。有些阶级敌对分子虽然隐蔽得很深，但他们并没有睡觉。只要有机可乘，有隙可钻，他们就会进行捣乱，祸害群众，破坏生产。我们必须警惕，坚决打击他们！农村的资本主义自发势力，也并不甘心被消灭，一有机会就会钻出来的。一钻出来，就应坚决斗争。还有一点也很重要：那些敌对的思想及行动，并不是直截了当地表达出来的、往往通过隐蔽的、曲折的形式。凡事要用阶级观点去分析和思考，切不可简单化。我们今天的胜利是从斗争中得来的。明天的更大胜利，还要从斗争中去发展，只有坚持党的阶级路线，坚持两条道路的斗争，才能当好群众的向导，把农村人民公社建设得更好。
