Victory Certainly Belongs to the Latin American People with Revolutionary Struggle Traditions

This year marks the 150th anniversary of the Latin American people's struggle for national liberation. As the wave of national democratic revolution in Latin America is surging to unprecedented heights, commemorating this great historical festival is of particularly significant importance. The Chinese people are launching the "Friendship Week to Commemorate the 150th Anniversary of Latin American Countries' Struggle for National Independence and Celebrate the Second Anniversary of the Cuban Revolution" starting today, expressing our deep friendship with the people of all Latin American countries, and supporting the heroic Cuban people and the people of all Latin American countries in their struggle against U.S. imperialism's aggression, for national independence, and for world peace.

One hundred and fifty years ago, a storm of struggle for national independence against Spanish colonial rule broke out in various parts of Latin America. After more than ten years of repeated and arduous struggle, the people of all ethnic groups in Latin America finally drove away the Spanish colonialists, and independent countries were established on this new continent, ushering in a new chapter in Latin American history.

Reviewing this period of Latin American people's struggle for national independence, what new insights can people gain from it?

First, cruel national oppression and colonial exploitation inevitably arouse resistance from the oppressed people. The Spanish colonialists implemented the most barbarous rule in the Latin American colonies, using every means to plunder the wealth of the colonies, monopolize colonial trade, and levy exorbitant taxes and cruel exploitation on the local people. It is estimated that in the three centuries from the 16th century to the beginning of the 19th century, Spanish colonialists extracted 2.5 million kilograms of gold and 100 million kilograms of silver from Latin American colonies. The colonial people were in a state of extreme poverty and backwardness. This could not but arouse strong hatred and resistance from the Latin American people. Once they awakened and rose up to fight for independence, they would inevitably develop into an irresistible wave.

Second, as long as the oppressed people unite and persist in struggle, they will surely achieve victory. More than a century ago, the Spanish colonial empire was seemingly powerful, and it carried out bloody suppression of the national independence movement in the Latin American colonies. However, the Indians, black slaves, and native whites of Latin America united under the common goal of fighting for liberation and independence, made persistent efforts, and persevered in the liberation war for more than ten years. After a tortuous road, they finally overthrew the dark rule of the Spanish colonialists.

Third, the Latin American people have a tradition of revolutionary struggle. Since the end of the 15th century, when they fell into colonial servitude, the Latin American people have never ceased their struggle against the colonialists. The large-scale revolution that broke out in 1815 and the new revolutionary upsurge that followed a few years later fully demonstrated that the Latin American people fighting for independence and freedom are unconquerable and invincible.

However, the revolutionary storm that arose one hundred and fifty years ago did not bring true liberation to the Latin American people. With the collapse of Spanish colonial rule, the imperialist forces of Britain, the United States, France, and Germany invaded. U.S. imperialism has stepped up its expansion, striving to exclude the forces of other imperialists, and making the Latin American countries its controlled semi-colonies. The history of Latin America over the past century has actually been a history of U.S. imperialism's aggression, oppression, and enslavement of the people of Latin American countries. U.S. imperialism replaced the Spanish colonialists and became the main oppressor and exploiter of the Latin American people. In just the past half-century, U.S. imperialism has plundered more than tens of billions of U.S. dollars in profits from Latin America (equivalent to several million kilograms of gold). The history of Latin America over the past century has also been a history of the people of Latin American countries struggling to get rid of new shackles of enslavement. The glorious revolutionary tradition of fighting against Spanish colonialists in the past has been inherited by the descendants of revolutionaries such as Bolivar, Hidalgo, Juarez, San Martin, Voikins, Sucre, and Jose Marti, who resolutely demand to control their own destiny.

Latin America is now in a new revolutionary period, and the storm of national democratic revolution is sweeping the entire continent. The Latin American people call their ongoing struggle the second great historical revolution for the liberation of Latin America, and they regard today's revolutionary struggle as a continuation of the anti-colonialist struggle of 1810. A century and a half ago, the Latin American people carried out a joint struggle against Spanish colonial rule and for national independence, and now they are facing a new common enemy: U.S. imperialism. The basic goal of their revolution today is to get rid of U.S. imperialism's various controls and restrictions, to safeguard national independence, defend national sovereignty, and to promote the country's economy, improve people's lives, and strive for the complete victory of the national democratic revolution. Such a magnificent national democratic revolutionary movement is unfolding on an even larger scale than the revolutionary struggle more than a century ago, and it will inevitably end U.S. imperialism's neo-colonial rule in Latin America.

At present, the situation of the national democratic revolution in Latin America is very good. The flames of the Cuban revolution have illuminated the path of the people of all Latin American countries. The level of awareness of the Latin American people has been raised to an unprecedented level. They not only increasingly clearly recognize that U.S. imperialism and the dictatorial regimes that serve it are their mortal enemies, but also realize that only by rising up and carrying out resolute struggles can they achieve the victory of national liberation. In many countries, patriotic people of all strata have increasingly united to form a broad national united front, and the people of all countries have increasingly strengthened their unity and supported each other in the common struggle. The entire international situation in which the East wind prevails over the West wind is also greatly conducive to the development of the Latin American people's struggle for national democratic revolution. In the recent period, the revolutionary movement in Latin America has further surged: the Cuban people are firmly carrying out the struggle against U.S. interference and pushing the revolution forward; the anti-dictatorial armed struggles of the people of Nicaragua, Paraguay, and Dominica continue to persist; the U.S.-backed dictator Lemus in El Salvador was overthrown; in Guatemala, which is under the strictest U.S. control, armed resistance against the puppet government has also broken out; the Venezuelan people's struggle to defend democracy is in full swing; unprecedented anti-American demonstrations have been launched throughout Ecuador; and in Argentina, Chile, Brazil, especially in the countries of Central America, large-scale strikes that are actually against the plunder of U.S. monopoly capital are constantly occurring. All these facts show that the Latin American people's national democratic revolutionary struggle will continue to move towards a new climax. It is no wonder that an Associated Press reporter recently worriedly predicted: "In 1961, revolution will spread like wildfire throughout Latin America."

However, it must be noted that U.S. imperialism is still trying its best to contain the progress of the Latin American national democratic revolutionary movement. The U.S. conspiracy to launch an armed invasion of Cuba is still being stepped up. According to U.S. news agencies, the U.S. State Department recently peddled a four-point plan to other Latin American countries to subvert the Cuban revolution, including forcing them to "collectively sever diplomatic relations" with Cuba, imposing a trade blockade on Cuba, and establishing a "Pan-American Security Force" to carry out armed intervention in Cuba. Although U.S. warships have been forced to withdraw from the Caribbean, it has not abandoned its conspiracy to interfere in the internal affairs of Guatemala and Nicaragua. The U.S. authorities are secretly building large airports in Guatemala, preparing them as bases for invading Cuba and other Latin American countries. In short, various facts show that U.S. imperialism is absolutely unwilling to lose its "backyard." This means that the people of all Latin American countries still need to go through arduous struggles to achieve victory. But there is no doubt that just as the Spanish colonialists could not save the collapse of their colonial rule in Latin America one hundred and fifty years ago, U.S. imperialism will never be able to stop the advance of the wheels of Latin American history.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out as early as 1947 that "the people of Latin America are not submissive slaves of U.S. imperialism." Now, the Latin American people have stood up heroically. The Latin American people, supported by the entire socialist camp and the people of the world, will surely be able to complete the revolutionary cause that their ancestors did not complete one hundred and fifty years ago, and create a truly free new Latin America.

    胜利一定属于富有革命斗争传统的拉丁美洲人民
    今年是拉丁美洲人民争取民族解放斗争一百五十周年。在拉丁美洲民族民主革命浪潮空前高涨的今天，我们来纪念这个伟大的历史节日，有着特别重大的意义。中国人民从今天起举行“纪念拉丁美洲各国争取民族独立一百五十周年和庆祝古巴革命胜利二周年友好周”，表达我们对拉丁美洲各国人民的深厚友谊，并且支持英雄的古巴人民和拉丁美洲各国人民为反对美帝国主义侵略、争取和维护民族独立、保卫世界和平所进行的斗争。
    一百五十年前，拉丁美洲各地爆发了反对西班牙殖民统治、争取民族独立的斗争风暴。拉丁美洲各族人民经过了十多年反复而艰巨的斗争，终于赶走了西班牙殖民者，而在这个新的大陆上成立了各个独立的国家，揭开了拉丁美洲历史新的篇章。
    重温拉丁美洲人民这一段争取民族独立的斗争史，人们能够从中得到什么样的新的启示呢？
    第一、残酷的民族压迫和殖民剥削，必然要激起被压迫人民的反抗。西班牙殖民者在拉丁美洲的殖民地上施行最野蛮的统治，用尽一切手段掠夺殖民地的财富，垄断殖民地的贸易，横征暴敛，残酷剥削当地的人民。据估计，在从十六世纪到十九世纪初的三个世纪中，西班牙殖民者就从拉丁美洲殖民地榨取了二百五十万公斤的黄金和一亿公斤的白银。殖民地人民处于极端贫困和落后的状态。这就不能不激起拉丁美洲人民强烈的仇恨和反抗。他们一旦觉醒，为争取独立而起来斗争，就必然会发展成为不可抗拒的浪潮。
    第二、被压迫的人民，只要团结起来，坚持斗争，他们就一定能够取得胜利。一个多世纪以前的西班牙殖民帝国是貌似强大的，它对拉丁美洲殖民地的民族独立运动进行了血腥的镇压。但是拉丁美洲的印第安人、黑人奴隶和土生的白人在争取解放和独立的共同目标下联合起来，再接再厉，把解放战争坚持了十几年，经过了曲折的道路，终于推翻了西班牙殖民者的黑暗统治。
  第三、拉丁美洲人民是具有革命斗争传统的。拉丁美洲人民自十五世纪末陷于殖民地奴役之日起，就从来没有停止过反对殖民者的斗争。1815年爆发的大规模的革命以及几年后再次掀起的新的革命高潮，充分显示了为独立自由而战的拉丁美洲人民是不可征服的、不可战胜的。
    但是，在一百五十年前兴起的革命风暴，并没有给拉丁美洲人民带来真正的解放。随着西班牙殖民统治的崩溃，却是英、美、法、德等帝国主义势力的侵入。美帝国主义更是步步加紧扩张；并竭力排斥其他帝国主义的势力，而使拉丁美洲各国成为它所控制的半殖民地。拉丁美洲近一百多年的历史，实际上是美帝国主义侵略、压迫和奴役拉丁美洲各国人民的历史。美帝国主义取代了西班牙殖民者而成了拉丁美洲人民最主要的压迫者和剥削者。仅仅是近半个世纪中，美帝国主义从拉丁美洲掠夺走的利润就有上百亿美元（折合成黄金也有好几百万公斤）。拉丁美洲近一百多年的历史，同时也是拉丁美洲各国人民为争取摆脱新的奴役枷锁而进行斗争的历史。当年反对西班牙殖民者的光荣的革命斗争传统，被博利瓦尔、伊达尔哥、胡亚雷斯、圣马丁、沃伊京斯、苏克雷和何塞·马蒂等革命者的后裔继承了下来，他们坚决要求掌握自己的命运。
    拉丁美洲今天又处在一个新的革命时期当中，民族民主革命的风暴正席卷着整个大陆。拉丁美洲人民把他们正在进行的斗争称之为争取拉丁美洲解放的第二次伟大的历史性的革命，他们把今天的革命斗争看成是1810年反殖民主义斗争的继续。一个半世纪以前，拉丁美洲人民为了反对西班牙的殖民统治，争取民族独立而进行了共同斗争，现在他们又面对着新的共同敌人美帝国主义。他们今天革命的基本目标是摆脱美帝国主义各种的控制和束缚，以维护民族独立、保卫国家主权、并繁荣本国经济、改善人民生活，争取民族民主革命的彻底胜利。这样一个气势磅礴的民族民主革命运动，正以远比一百多年前的革命斗争更为巨大的规模展开着，它必然以结束美帝国主义在拉丁美洲的新殖民主义统治而告终。
    目前，拉丁美洲民族民主革命的形势好得很。古巴革命的火焰，照亮了拉丁美洲各国人民的道路。拉丁美洲人民的觉悟程度已经空前提高，他们不但愈来愈清楚地认识到美帝国主义以及为它服务的独裁政权是他们的死敌，而且认识到，只有起来进行坚决的斗争，才能使斗争取得民族解放的胜利。在许多国家，各阶层的爱国人民已经日益团结起来，结成广泛的民族统一战线，而且各国人民在共同斗争中也日益加强团结，互相支持。东风压倒西风的整个国际形势，也大大有利于拉丁美洲人民争取民族民主革命的发展。最近一个时期，拉丁美洲的革命运动又有了进一步的高涨，古巴人民坚定地进行反对美国干涉的斗争，把革命往前推进；尼加拉瓜、巴拉圭和多米尼加人民的反独裁武装斗争继续在坚持中；萨尔瓦多受美国支持的独裁者莱穆斯被推翻；在美国控制最严的危地马拉，也爆发了反对傀儡政府的武装反抗行动；委内瑞拉人民保卫民主的斗争方兴未艾；厄瓜多尔全国各地掀起了规模空前巨大的反美示威；在阿根廷、智利、巴西，特别是在中美洲各国，不断发生实际上是反对美国垄断资本掠夺的大罢工。所有这些事实都表明，拉丁美洲人民的民族民主革命斗争，将继续走向新的高潮。难怪美联社记者最近忧心忡忡地预计到：“在1961年革命将像燎原之火一样遍及整个拉丁美洲。”
    但是，不能不看到，美帝国主义仍然竭力想要遏止拉丁美洲民族民主革命运动的进展。美国对古巴进行武装侵略的阴谋仍然在加紧策划。据美国通讯社透露，美国国务院最近还向拉丁美洲其他国家兜售颠复古巴革命的四点计划，包括迫使它们同古巴“集体断绝邦交”，对古巴实行贸易封锁和建立一支“泛美安全部队”来对古巴进行武装干涉。美国的军舰虽然被迫从加勒比海撤走，但是它并没有放弃干涉危地马拉和尼加拉瓜等国内政的阴谋。美国当局最近正在危地马拉秘密修筑大型机场，准备作为侵略古巴和其他拉丁美洲国家的基地。总之，各种事实说明，美帝国主义是绝不甘心失去它的“后院”的。这也就是说，拉丁美洲各国人民要取得斗争的胜利，还需要经过艰巨的斗争。但是毫无疑问，正如西班牙殖民者在一百五十年前无法挽救它在拉丁美洲的殖民统治的崩溃一样，美帝国主义也绝不能阻挡拉丁美洲历史车轮的前进。
    毛泽东同志早在1947年就已经指出，“拉丁美洲的人民，并不是顺从美国帝国主义的奴隶”。现在，拉丁美洲人民已经英勇地站起来了。有着整个社会主义阵营和全世界人民支持的拉丁美洲人民，他们一定能够完成他们的祖先在一百五十年前所未完成的革命事业，缔造出一个真正自由的新拉丁美洲。
