    新华社平壤19日电　据这里的报纸19日报道，朝鲜在匈牙利人民支援下建设的一座具有年产九百吨染料能力的本宫化学染料工厂，18日举行竣工仪式，即将正式投入生产。
    朝鲜党政领导人李钟玉、李克鲁等参加了竣工仪式。参加竣工仪式的还有以匈牙利驻朝鲜大使普拉特·卡罗伊为团长、前来朝鲜进行友好访问的匈牙利政府代表团，以及帮助建设这个工厂的匈牙利技术人员。
    李钟玉副首相和普拉特·卡罗伊大使在竣工仪式上的讲话中一致指出，这座现代化工厂是朝匈两国人民间的国际主义友谊的产物。
    本宫化学染料工厂是从1958年4月开始动工兴建的，它除了生产各色染料以外，还能生产大量的安息油、海波驱虫剂、樟脑等二十多种化学药品。这对进一步发展朝鲜的染料工业、制药工业和食品工业将起很大的作用。
