    Following the Path Forged by the Anti-Japanese United Army
    PLA Soldier Hou Xuechun
    Wild geese fly south to find warmth,
    We climb Changbai Mountain,
    Braving wind and frost.
    Following the path forged by the Anti-Japanese United Army,
    To reclaim wasteland in the deep mountains and old forests.
    Towering ancient trees are lush and green,
    Under the trees, an old shack gleams,
    In a waist-high weed patch,
    A pair of roe deer pricks up their ears, startled.
    Twenty years ago, the Anti-Japanese United Army reclaimed land here,
    Producing with one hand,
    Fighting the Eastern Ocean devils with the other!
    In spring, golden seeds are sown,
    In autumn, wheat waves replace the desolation.
    The Anti-Japanese United Army soldiers created miracles through self-reliance,
    Changbai Mountain offers food with both hands!
    Following the path forged by the Anti-Japanese United Army,
    We repair the shack and reclaim wasteland here!
    The heroic flame is passed on by heroes,
    Galloping on the road to communism,
    Next year, the spring breeze arrives at the shack,
    With green wheat waves and yellow rape flowers...

    沿着抗日联军踏出的道路
    解放军战士　侯学纯
    大雁南飞去找温暖的地方，
    我们攀上长白山，
    冒着风霜。
    沿着抗日联军踏出的道路，
    到深山老林里去开荒。
    参天的古树郁郁葱葱，
    树底下闪出个古旧的窝棚，
    在一片没腰的杂草丛中，
    一对黄羊正竖起耳朵发楞。
    廾年前抗日联军就在这儿开荒，
    一手生产，
    一手打东洋！
    春天播下金黄的种子，
    秋天麦浪代替了荒凉。
    抗日联军战士自力更生创奇迹，
    长白山双手捧出了食粮！
    沿着抗日联军踏出的道路，
    我们修葺好窝棚在这儿开荒！
    英雄的火种英雄接，
    奔驰在通向共产主义的大道上，
    来年春风到窝棚，
    麦浪青青菜花黄……。
