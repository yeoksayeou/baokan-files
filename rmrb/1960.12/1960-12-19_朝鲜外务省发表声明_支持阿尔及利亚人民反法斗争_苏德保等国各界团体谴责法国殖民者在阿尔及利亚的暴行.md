Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 17th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement today, strongly condemning the French colonialists' barbaric massacres of the Algerian people and expressing active support for the Algerian people's just struggle.

The statement first pointed out that French imperialists continue to wage a brutal war of aggression in Algeria. Recently, French invading troops and police inhumanely massacred and are massacring Algerian people in Algiers and other cities who are engaged in a just struggle for national independence, opposing the deceptive "referendum" by French imperialists aimed at prolonging their colonial rule. This fact fully exposes that after the bankruptcy of the imperialists' aggressive policy, they are struggling even more savagely, suppressing the people engaged in just struggles.

The statement said: The colonial plundering policy and atrocities carried out by French imperialists in Algeria today rely on the systematic support and assistance of US imperialists. US imperialism continues to supply French imperialism with various weapons to massacre the Algerian people and helps French imperialists wage war.

However, the statement emphasized: Any barbaric actions and atrocities by French imperialists, protected by US imperialists, cannot frustrate the Algerian people's will to fight resolutely for national independence and freedom, and such barbaric actions and atrocities will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat.

The statement expressed that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the entire Korean people angrily and firmly condemn and protest the crimes of the French imperialists in Algeria and will continue to actively support and support the just struggle of the Algerian people and the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria against French imperialism and for national independence and freedom.

The statement concluded by emphasizing: "The Korean people strongly assert that the French imperialists' criminal acts of aggression in massacring the Algerian people must be stopped immediately, and the French invading troops must get out of Algeria. The Korean people are convinced that the Algerian people will defeat the French colonialists and achieve victory in their sacred struggle for national independence and freedom."

Xinhua News Agency, December 17th: Various groups in the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and Bulgaria have condemned the French authorities' atrocities in Algeria.

The Presidium of the Soviet Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee issued a statement saying that the Soviet people demand severe punishment for the criminals who carried out the bloody suppression of the Algerian residents.

The statement emphasized that the Soviet people stand entirely on the side of the struggling Algerian people. The Soviet people firmly condemn the new crimes of the French colonialists and demand an end to the atrocities.

The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, in the name of 55 million Soviet trade union members, issued a statement strongly protesting the bloody terror and lawless acts perpetrated by the French authorities in Algeria. The statement said, "The working people of the Soviet Union express sympathy for the Algerian people, deep sorrow for the victims of the terrorist activities, and angrily condemn the French reactionary groups who have caused this tragic consequence through their policies."

The National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany also wrote to the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization, expressing sympathy and support for the Algerian people.

Participants in a conference of cultural workers in the Dresden district of the German Democratic Republic sent a telegram to the President of the United Nations General Assembly, expressing indignation at the French atrocities in Algeria.

The Bulgarian National Peace Committee, in a telegram to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, demanded an immediate end to the unbridled massacres of the Algerian people.

    新华社平壤17日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省今天发表声明，严厉谴责法国殖民主义者野蛮屠杀阿尔及利亚人民的暴行，并表示积极支持阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争。
    声明首先指出，法帝国主义者继续在阿尔及利亚进行着野蛮的侵略战争，最近法国侵略军队和警察又在阿尔及利亚的阿尔及尔等几个城市惨无人道地屠杀了并正在屠杀着为反对法帝国主义者以延续其殖民统治为目的的骗人的“公民投票”、为民族独立而进行正义斗争的阿尔及利亚人民。这一事实充分暴露了帝国主义者的侵略政策破产以后，越发野蛮地挣扎，镇压进行正义斗争的人民。
    声明说：法帝国主义者今天在阿尔及利亚实行的殖民掠夺政策和暴行，是依靠着美帝国主义者的有系统的支持和援助的。美帝国主义继续供给法帝国主义以屠杀阿尔及利亚人民的各种武器等，帮助法帝国主义者进行战争。
    但是，声明强调说：受到美帝国主义者庇护的法帝国主义者的任何野蛮行动和暴行，也挫折不了为民族独立和自由而坚决斗争的阿尔及利亚人民的斗争意志，这种野蛮行动和暴行必将遭到可耻的惨败。
    声明表示，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民愤怒地坚决谴责和抗议法帝国主义者在阿尔及利亚的罪行，并将继续积极支持和声援阿尔及利亚人民和阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府为反对法帝国主义、争取民族独立和自由而进行的正义斗争。
    声明最后强调说：“朝鲜人民强硬主张，法帝国主义者屠杀阿尔及利亚人民的犯罪的侵略行为必须立即停止，法国侵略军队必须从阿尔及利亚滚出去。朝鲜人民确信，阿尔及利亚人民在争取民族独立和自由的神圣斗争中，必将打败法国殖民主义者，取得胜利。”
    新华社17日讯　苏联、德意志民主共和国和保加利亚等国各界团体纷纷谴责法国当局在阿尔及利亚的暴行。
    苏联亚非团结委员会主席团发表的声明说，苏联人民要求严厉惩办对阿尔及利亚居民进行血腥镇压的罪犯。
    声明着重指出，苏联人民完全站在正在斗争的阿尔及利亚人民一边。苏联人民坚决谴责法国殖民主义者的新罪行，要求停止暴行。
    全苏工会中央理事会以苏联工会五千五百万会员的名义发表声明，坚决抗议法国当局在阿尔及利亚制造的血腥恐怖和无法无天的行为。声明说，“苏联劳动人民表示同情阿尔及利亚人民，对恐怖活动的受害者深表悲痛，并愤怒斥责通过自己的政策造成这种悲剧后果的法国反动集团。”
    民主德国全国阵线全国委员会也写信给亚非人民团结组织，对阿尔及利亚人民表示同情和支持。
    德意志民主共和国德累斯顿专区文化工作者会议的参加者曾打电报给联合国大会主席，对法国在阿尔及利亚的暴行表示愤慨。
