Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 15th: The Soviet "Labor News" published an editorial today entitled "Eternal, Unbreakable Friendship," stating that "Sino-Soviet friendship is higher than the sky and deeper than the sea." This is how millions of builders in New China feel, and this is how millions of Soviet people feel. The unity of our two peoples strengthens our heroic strength. The unity, fraternal friendship, and comradely cooperation between the Soviet Union and China enrich our two countries and accelerate our progress towards socialism and communism.

The editorial pointed out that the socialist camp is great and powerful. The socialist countries in Asia and Europe have more than one billion people, accounting for one-third of humanity. This is a united, friendly, and truly fraternal family, all members of which are walking the same path and have common goals. The recent meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties of various countries is a brilliant proof of the strong unity of the people of the socialist camp.

The editorial said that socialist countries, jointly building a new life, are united in their foreign policy, and they consistently implement the policy of peaceful coexistence left to us by the great Lenin. The powerful socialist camp is now experiencing a period of unprecedented upsurge and prosperity of people's power. The enemy has tried more than once to undermine the friendship between brotherly countries, attempting to sow seeds of distrust among them. This is a waste of effort. The unity of socialist countries on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism is eternal and unbreakable. The editorial emphasized that the friendship and unity of brotherly countries are a guarantee of new victories in the great battle for the bright future of mankind, for peace, and for the victory of the cause of socialism.

    苏联《劳动报》发表社论
    中苏友谊比天还高比海还深
    兄弟国家的团结是社会主义事业新胜利的保证
    新华社莫斯科15日电　苏联《劳动报》今天以《永恒的、牢不可破的友谊》为题发表社论说，“中苏友谊比天还高，比海还深”，千百万新中国的建设者们是这样体会的，千百万苏联人民也是这样体会的。我们两国人民的团结一致，增强了我们的勇士般的力量。苏中两国的团结一致、兄弟般的友谊和同志式的合作，使我们两国富强，加快我们向社会主义和共产主义前进的速度。
    社论指出，社会主义阵营是伟大的，强有力的。亚欧两洲的社会主义国家有十亿多人民，占人类的三分之一。这是团结的、友好的、真正的兄弟大家庭，所有的成员走着同一的道路，有着共同的目标。不久前召开的各国共产党和工人党代表会议就是社会主义阵营人民坚强团结的光辉证明。
    社论说，共同建设新生活的社会主义国家在对外政策上团结一致，他们一贯执行伟大列宁遗留给我们的和平共处政策。强大的社会主义阵营现在正经历着空前高涨和人民力量繁荣的时期。敌人不止一次地想破坏兄弟国家间的友谊，企图在兄弟国家间散布不信任的种子。这真是白费气力。社会主义国家在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的团结是永恒的、牢不可破的。社论强调说：兄弟国家的友谊和团结是在为人类光辉未来、为和平和社会主义事业胜利的伟大战斗中获得新胜利的保证。
