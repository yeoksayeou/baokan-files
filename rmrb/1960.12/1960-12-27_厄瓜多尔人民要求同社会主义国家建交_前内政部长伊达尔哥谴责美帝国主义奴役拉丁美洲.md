Xinhua News Agency, Guayaquil, 23rd -- Recently, the call for Ecuador to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and various socialist countries has been growing louder. When the General Secretary of the Ecuadorian Communist Party, Pedro Saad, spoke to the "Review" magazine in Guayaquil about this matter, he pointed out that establishing diplomatic and trade relations with socialist countries would undoubtedly be very beneficial to us, because only in this way can Ecuador get rid of its economic dependence on the United States for selling products and purchasing materials.

Jose Hanna Musse, leader of the Ecuadorian People's Concentrated Force, pointed out in an interview with the aforementioned magazine that the lack of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union is a mistake in Ecuadorian foreign policy. This mistake has kept us away from one of the world's leading powers for a long time and has caused serious losses to our economy.

Salas Mancheno, a Velasco-affiliated congressman, said in a speech that the people's proposals must be studied so that our country can establish diplomatic relations with socialist countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Guayaquil, 23rd -- Araujo Hidalgo, the Ecuadorian Minister of Interior who was recently removed from office under pressure from the United States, told reporters yesterday that he believes "Pan-Americanism" is useless to the people of Latin America and only benefits US imperialism, which plunders the wealth of the Latin American people and enslaves Latin American countries in all aspects.

Araujo said: "We are facing the birth of a great Latin American revolution, and the national liberation struggles of our people, especially the heroic Cuban people, prove this."

Araujo also stated that it is absolutely urgent for Ecuador to establish the broadest possible relations with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries. He emphasized, "We should sever all ties with the Taiwan traitors and recognize the firm will of the Chinese people who have established a legitimate government." He said, "Six hundred and fifty million people cannot be forgotten outside organizations like the United Nations if these organizations truly hope to maintain world peace and have worldwide representation."

    厄瓜多尔人民要求同社会主义国家建交
    前内政部长伊达尔哥谴责美帝国主义奴役拉丁美洲
    据新华社瓜亚基尔23日电　最近一个时期来，厄瓜多尔人民要求与苏联和各社会主义国家建立外交关系的呼声日益高涨。厄瓜多尔共产党总书记佩德罗·萨德就这件事对瓜亚基尔的《评论》杂志谈话时指出，毫无疑问，同社会主义国家建立外交和贸易关系将是对我们非常有利的，因为只有这样，才能使厄瓜多尔摆脱在经济上出售产品和购买物资方面单单依赖美国的状态。
    厄瓜多尔人民力量集中党领导人何塞·安纳·穆塞在向上述杂志谈话时指出，没有同苏联建立外交关系，是厄瓜多尔外交政策上的一个错误。这个错误使我们长期远离世界上的头等强国之一，并给我们的经济带来严重的损失。
    贝拉斯科派的众议员萨拉斯·曼切诺在一次讲话时说，必须研究人民的建议，以便使我国和社会主义国家建立外交关系。
    据新华社瓜亚基尔23日电　最近在美国压力下去职的厄瓜多尔内政部长阿劳霍·伊达尔哥昨天对记者发表谈话说，他认为“泛美主义”对拉丁美洲各国人民毫无用处，而只是有利于掠夺拉丁美洲人民财富和从各个方面奴役拉丁美洲各国的美帝国主义。
    阿劳霍说：“我们正面临着伟大的拉丁美洲革命的诞生，我们各国人民，首先是英勇的古巴人民的民族解放斗争就证明了这一点。”
    阿劳霍还表示，对厄瓜多尔来说，绝对迫切地需要与苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家建立尽可能广泛的关系。他强调说，“我们应该断绝与台湾卖国贼的一切联系，承认已经建立了合法政府的中国人民的坚决意志。”他说，“六亿五千万人不能被遗忘在像联合国这样的组织之外，如果这些组织真正希望维护世界和平和具有世界范围的代表性的话。”
