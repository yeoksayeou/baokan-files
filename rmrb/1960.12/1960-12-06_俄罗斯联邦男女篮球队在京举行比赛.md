Xinhua News Agency, December 5th – The Soviet Russian Federation men's and women's basketball teams held their seventh friendly matches in China tonight in Beijing. The men's team defeated the "Avant-Garde" Sports Association team, which ranked fourth in this year's national basketball A-League, with a score of 81 to 67. The women's team won against the Shanghai First team, which ranked sixth in the national basketball A-League, with a score of 64 to 53.

    In the men's game, the visiting team, with its tall players, consistently held an advantage and maintained a leading score. By the end of the first half, they led by ten points with a score of 40 to 30. Although the "Avant-Garde" team adopted a full-court press and man-to-man defense in the second half to try to reverse the situation, their players' shooting accuracy was insufficient, especially in rebounding, which left them at a disadvantage in the face of the opponent's frequent fast breaks. The visiting team's top scorer tonight was center Borodin (No. 4), a member of the Soviet national youth team, who scored a total of 23 points. Scoring expert Kanteli (No. 7) only played for half the game but scored 11 points. Novikov (No. 10)'s accurate long-distance shots and Yin Guoliang (No. 15) of the home team’s clever cut-in layups also left a deep impression on the audience.

    In tonight's women's game, the two sides engaged in a seesaw battle in the first half. After the tenth tie at 30-30, the visiting team's score began to consistently lead, with the score at the end of the first half being 34-31. In the second half, the visiting team had the advantage in rebounding (the visiting team grabbed 18 rebounds, while the home team only had five), which allowed them to launch many fast breaks, leaving the Shanghai First team unable to defend. The visiting team's athletes Yegreleva (No. 8) and captain Vikshnina (No. 7) scored a total of 41 points, accounting for more than 64% of the visiting team's total score.

    The visiting men's and women's teams will play their last friendly match in China against the Chinese combined men's and women's basketball teams in Beijing on the evening of the 6th.

    俄罗斯联邦男女篮球队在京举行比赛
    新华社5日讯　苏联俄罗斯联邦男女篮球队今晚在北京进行访华第七次友谊比赛，男子队以八十一比六十七战胜了我国今年全国篮球甲级队联赛第四名“前卫”体育协会队；女子队以六十四比五十三赢了全国篮球甲级队联赛第六名上海一队。
    在男子队的比赛中，队员身材高大的客队始终占着优势，得分一直领先。上半场比赛结束时，他们以四十比三十领先了十分。下半场“前卫”队虽然采用全场紧逼人盯人的防守战术，力争扭转局势，但队员在进攻时投篮不够准确，尤其是篮板球抢不过对方，因而多次遭到对方快速反击处于被动。客队今晚得分最多的是中锋、苏联国家青年队队员鲍罗丁（四号），全场共得了二十三分。得分能手坎捷利（七号）只打了半场，得了十一分。十号诺维科夫的准确的远距离投篮，以及主队尹国梁（十五号）的巧妙切入上篮动作，也给观众留下很深的印象。
    今晚女子队的上半场比赛双方展开拉锯战，打到第十次平局——三十平后，客队得分才开始一直领先，上半场结束时的比数是三十四比三十一。下半场客队在抢篮板球方面占了优势（客队抢到十八次，主队只五次），因而多次发动快攻使上海一队防守不及。客队运动健将叶格列娃（八号）和队长维克申娜（七号）全场共得了四十一分，占客队得分总数的64％以上。
    客队男女队6日晚将在北京同我国的联队男女篮球队进行访华最后一场友谊赛。
