Xinhua News Agency, December 25th, Oran Dispatch: On the eve of Christmas, in Oran, the second largest city in French-occupied Algeria, mass patriotic demonstrations by Algerian residents erupted again, opposing French colonial rule and protesting the French colonial army's search and arrest of leaders of the Algerian national liberation movement. This demonstration started on the evening of the 23rd, lasted for two consecutive nights, and was still ongoing at 2:30 this morning.

On the 23rd, when the French colonial authorities were searching for leaders of the Algerian national liberation movement in Oran, Algerian Muslims in the Victor Hugo district and the slum area of Petit Lac, including many women, poured into the streets to hold protest demonstrations. Enraged demonstrators brandished knives, axes, and the flags of the Algerian National Liberation Front, shouting slogans such as "Long Live Algeria" and "Long Live the National Liberation Front," and demolished some colonial buildings. This all-night demonstration lasted from the evening of the 23rd to the morning of the 24th.

The frightened French colonial authorities immediately dispatched mobile gendarmerie units on the morning of the 24th to participate in the suppression, as the colonial police could no longer prevent the demonstrators from reorganizing.

However, the colonialists' intensified armed suppression could not stop the Algerian people's demonstration struggle for independence. On the evening of the 24th, Algerians launched an even more intense struggle. The struggle was particularly fierce in the Victor Hugo district and the Petit Lac slum area. Algerian Muslims, divided into demonstration teams of fifty to one hundred people, overwhelmed the French colonial army. In the Petit Lac area, three hundred Muslims surrounded the police station on Victor Hugo Avenue at 2:30 this morning, damaging the facade of the police station with stones. Colonial police and mobile gendarmerie units opened fire on the demonstrators, and one Muslim was injured.

At the same time, Edward Herriot Avenue in the new urban area was once controlled by demonstrators.

According to Western news agencies, some colonial police officers there believe that this demonstration is more serious than the demonstrations that broke out not long ago during de Gaulle's "inspection" of Algeria.

It is reported that on the eve of Christmas, the situation is also tense in Algiers and other French-occupied areas of Algeria.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 21st: The "Voice of the Algerian Republic" radio station said in a broadcast tonight that de Gaulle's speech yesterday revealed his true imperialist colors.

In a televised broadcast in Paris on December 20th, de Gaulle continued to promote his "referendum" fraud, which was firmly opposed by the Algerian people, clamoring for a so-called "ceasefire" in an attempt to use it as a guise to get the Algerian National Liberation Army to surrender.

The radio station continued, even if de Gaulle asked the armies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to help him carry out this imperialist war against the Algerian people, Algeria would never continue to be a French colony.

The radio station said that the Algerian people's struggle will shatter the dreams of extreme colonialists who attempt to permanently maintain French rule over Algeria. The radio station emphasized that the Algerian people are determined to continue the fight until the imperialists withdraw from Algeria.

    法国殖民者扑灭不了阿尔及利亚人民的斗争火焰
    奥兰群众再次举行反法爱国示威
    示威者挥舞刀子斧头捣毁警察派出所
    新华社25日讯　奥兰消息：圣诞节前夕，在被法国占领的阿尔及利亚第二大城奥兰，再次爆发阿尔及利亚居民的群众性爱国示威，反对法国殖民统治，抗议法国殖民军队搜捕阿尔及利亚民族解放运动领袖。这次示威从23日晚开始，举行了两个通宵，到今天清晨二点半还在继续进行。
    23日，当法国殖民当局在奥兰市内搜捕阿尔及利亚民族解放运动领袖时，这个城市的维克多·雨果区和小湖贫民区的阿尔及利亚的穆斯林们，包括许多妇女，纷纷拥向街头举行抗议示威。激怒的示威者挥舞着刀子、斧头和阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的旗帜，高呼：“阿尔及利亚万岁”、“民族解放阵线万岁”等口号，并且捣毁了一些殖民者的建筑物。这次通宵示威一直从23日晚进行到24日上午。
    心惊胆战的法国殖民当局24日清早立即调来了宪兵别动队参加镇压，因为殖民警察已无法阻止示威者重新组织起来。
    但是，殖民者的加紧武装镇压并不能阻止阿尔及利亚人民争取独立的示威斗争。24日晚上，阿尔及利亚人展开了更加激烈的斗争。在维克多·雨果区和小湖贫民区，斗争尤为激烈。阿尔及利亚的穆斯林分成五十人到一百人的示威队伍，使法国殖民军狼狈不堪。在小湖区有三百名穆斯林在今天清晨二点半包围了维克多·雨果大街的警察派出所，用石块打坏了派出所的门面。殖民警察和宪兵别动队向示威者开了枪，有一名穆斯林受伤。
    与此同时，沿新市区的爱德华·赫里欧大街曾一度被示威者所控制。
    据西方通讯社报道，那里某些殖民警官认为，这次示威比不久前戴高乐“巡视”阿尔及利亚时爆发的示威更加严重。
    据报道，在圣诞节前夕，在阿尔及尔和阿尔及利亚其他法国占领的地方也局势紧张。
    新华社开罗21日电　“阿尔及利亚共和国之声”电台今晚在一篇广播中说，戴高乐昨天发表的演说揭示了他的帝国主义真面目。
    戴高乐20日在巴黎发表的电视广播演说中，继续鼓吹他的遭到阿尔及利亚人民坚决反对的“公民投票”的骗局，叫嚷所谓“停火”，企图以此作为幌子要阿尔及利亚民族解放军投降。
    电台接着说，即使戴高乐要求北大西洋公约组织的军队来帮他进行这场反对阿尔及利亚人民的帝国主义战争，阿尔及利亚也决计不会继续作法国的殖民地。
    电台说，阿尔及利亚人民的斗争将使极端殖民主义分子企图永久保持法国对阿尔及利亚的统治的梦想破灭。电台强调说，阿尔及利亚人民决心把战斗继续下去，直到帝国主义者撤出阿尔及利亚为止。
