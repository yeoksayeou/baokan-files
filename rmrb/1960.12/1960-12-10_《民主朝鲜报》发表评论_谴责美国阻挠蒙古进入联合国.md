Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 9th:

    "Minzhu Chao Xian Bao" published a commentary today stating that the Korean people express indignation at the provocative actions of the United States and its followers in trying every possible means to obstruct the entry of the Mongolian People's Republic into the United Nations. The Korean people fully support the statement issued by the Mongolian People's Republic on this matter on the 7th.
    The commentary said that today, anyone with a little ability to think cannot deny the fact that the Mongolian People's Republic exists and that its international status is rising. The Mongolian People's Republic should and must have its own seat in the United Nations.
    The commentary said that, in fact, for the sake of its own aggressive interests, American imperialism uses the United Nations as its tool of aggression. American imperialism once used the banner of the United Nations to carry out armed aggression against Korea; today, under the banner of the United Nations, it is brutally trampling on the independence and freedom of the Congolese people. We, together with the people of the world, must not tolerate this criminal behavior of American imperialism and its followers.

    谴责美国阻挠蒙古进入联合国
    新华社平壤9日电　《民主朝鲜报》今天发表评论说，朝鲜人民对美国和它的走卒千方百计地阻挠蒙古人民共和国进入联合国的挑衅行为，表示愤慨。朝鲜人民完全支持蒙古人民共和国7日就此发表的声明。
    评论说，今天不论是谁，只要有一点点思考能力的人都不能否认蒙古人民共和国的俨然存在和它的国际地位日益提高的这一事实。蒙古人民共和国应当而且必须在联合国内有自己的席位。
    评论说，事实上美帝国主义为了自己侵略的利益，把联合国当作自己的侵略工具。美帝国主义曾经盗用联合国的旗帜对朝鲜进行武装侵略；今天又在联合国的旗帜下，残酷地践踏刚果人民的独立和自由，我们同全世界人民决不能容许美帝国主义及其追随者的这种犯罪行为。
