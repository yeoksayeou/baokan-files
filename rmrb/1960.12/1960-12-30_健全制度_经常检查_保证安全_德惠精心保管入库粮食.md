    Sound Systems, Regular Inspections, Ensure Safety:
    Dehui Meticulously Manages Grain Entering Storage
   This newspaper reports that while vigorously promoting grain storage, the grain departments of Dehui County, Jilin Province, have universally strengthened grain storage management to ensure the safety of the grain entering storage.

    Currently, 83% of the grain purchased by Dehui County has been put into storage. Due to the large quantity of grain entering storage, large grain piles, high moisture content, and much open-air storage, it is necessary to pay close attention to storage management. To ensure grain safety and prevent even a single grain from becoming moldy, the grain departments of Dehui County, from top to bottom, have universally strengthened leadership in grain storage management. The County Grain Bureau established a Grain Protection Committee and convened two meetings of grain depot directors and grain management station chiefs in a row, analyzed the new situation in grain storage management, and made specific arrangements for winter grain storage management. At the same time, more than a dozen grain storage workers were transferred to form four mobile inspection teams, which went deep into various grain storage units to conduct circular inspections and provide guidance. Each grain storage unit also had a leading comrade in charge, specifically grasping grain storage management, and, under the leadership of the local Party committee, established a Grain Protection Committee and a grain inspection team to inspect grain in a timely manner and comprehensively do a good job in covering the grain. At present, hundreds of cargo spaces in the county's grain storage units have been completely covered.

    Now, while grasping the storage of purchased grain, all grain storage units are fully mobilizing employees to carry out a comprehensive survey and sorting of grain moisture and quality, focusing on checking moisture content, quality, grain temperature, inspection systems, and responsibility systems. According to the quality of the grain, moisture content, grain type, and category, the grain is sorted by cargo space and categorized into safe grain (moisture content below 15%), semi-safe grain (moisture content below 20%), and dangerous grain (moisture content above 20%), and signs have been established and different measures have been taken. Dangerous cargo spaces with early storage, high grain temperature, high moisture content, and large grain piles have all been subjected to turning piles, checking by cutting the waist and digging the pile, digging the core and bottom, and bagging around the pile. All treatments have been completed, and dangerous cargo spaces have been turned into safe cargo spaces. High-moisture grain found in the general survey has also been promptly frozen and dried to reduce the moisture content to below 20%, so that this part of the grain will not become moldy.

    All grain storage units have established and improved grain storage inspection systems, stipulating that all high-moisture grain, easily perishable corn, and dangerous grain piles stored in the open air must be checked daily for minor issues and every two days for major issues, while other grains must be checked every three days for minor issues and every five days for major issues. Every warehouse must be visited, every grain must be checked, and the inspection must be thorough, discovering and addressing problems during the inspection process. All grain storage units have also universally established and improved storage responsibility systems, implementing a system of assigning specific personnel to be responsible for grain piles, grain stacks, grain bins, and grain warehouses. At the same time, all localities have strengthened the four preventions for grain, ensuring that stored grain does not suffer from mold, theft, fire, or other losses.

    健全制度　经常检查　保证安全
    德惠精心保管入库粮食
   本报讯　吉林省德惠县粮食部门在大抓粮食入库的同时，普遍加强了粮食保管工作，保证入库粮食安全。
    现在，德惠县83％的征购粮已经入库。由于入库的粮食数量大、粮堆大、水分大，露天存放的多，所以，要求十分注意保管。为了保证粮食安全、不霉一粒粮食，德惠县粮食部门由上到下普遍加强了粮食保管工作的领导，县粮食局成立了护粮委员会，一连召开两次粮库主任、粮食管理所长会议，分析了粮食保管工作的新情况，对冬季粮食保管工作作了具体布置。同时，抽调十几名粮食保管员，组成四个流动检查小组，分别深入各储粮单位，循环检查、指导。各储粮单位也都有一名领导同志挂帅，专门抓粮食保管工作，并且在当地党委领导下建立了护粮委员会，成立了粮食检查组，及时检查粮食，全面作好了粮食苫盖工作。目前，全县储粮单位的几百个货位，已经全部苫盖好。
    现在，各储粮单位正在抓征购粮入库的同时，充分发动职工对库存粮食开展了以查水分、查质量、查粮温、查检查制度、查责任制度为内容的粮食水分、质量大普查、大排队工作。根据粮食质量优劣，水分大小，按货位、分粮种、分类排队，区分了安全粮（水分在15％以下）、半安全粮（水分在20％以下）、危险粮（水分在20％以上），并且建立了标志，采取了不同措施。入库早、粮温高、水分大、粮堆大的危险货位，都采取翻堆倒动、断腰扒堆检查、挖心掏底、围堆灌袋等处理措施，全部处理完毕，由危险货位变为安全货位。对普查出的高水分粮食，也及时采取冻晒办法，把水分降到20％以内，使这部分粮食不致发生霉变。
    各储粮单位都建立与健全了粮食保管检查制度，规定凡是高水分粮食，容易变质的苞米以及露天堆放的危险粮堆，都必须作到一天一小查、两天一大查，其它粮食三天一小查、五天一大查。有仓必到，有粮必查，查必彻底，边检查发现问题，边作处理。各储粮单位还都普遍建立与健全了保管责任制度，实行了粮堆、粮垛、粮囤、粮仓专人负责制度。同时，各地还都加强了粮食四防工作，保证库存粮食不遭到霉坏、盗窃、火烧等损失。
