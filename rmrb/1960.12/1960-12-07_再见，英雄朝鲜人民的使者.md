Goodbye, Envoys of the Heroic Korean People

Xinhua News Agency reporters Tong Xiwen, Li Jianyu

On the evening of December 3rd, the Shenyang "August 1st" Theater was brightly lit and filled with thunderous applause. As the purplish-red curtain slowly fell, the audience, immersed in the warm atmosphere of the profound friendship between China and North Korea, stood beside their seats with reluctance, unwilling to leave. This was the scene after the closing performance of the Korean People's Army Ensemble's visit to China. The distinguished guests, laden with accolades and friendship, were about to return home.

On the day the Korean People's Army Ensemble arrived in Shenyang for their visit and performance, how excited were the former Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers in Shenyang, the old stretcher-bearers from the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the literary and art workers who had visited North Korea for performances, and the millions of people of Shenyang! Wearing the medals and awards bestowed upon them by the Korean government, they braved the morning chill, holding bouquets, colorful flags, and carrying gongs and drums, to welcome their loved ones at the station. On the evening of the 1st, they once again watched the wonderful performance of their comrades with unparalleled joy in the theater. When the moving scene of the dance "Comrades-in-Arms," reflecting the Chinese and North Korean soldiers supporting each other with blood and persevering in their counterattack against the American imperialist aggressor troops, appeared on the stage, the eyes of Zheng Qi, a former second-class combat hero of the Volunteer Army, welled up with tears. He recalled the scene in the spring of 1953 when he and a North Korean People's Army anti-aircraft artillery unit jointly guarded Mangyongdae, the hometown of Marshal Kim Il-sung. In those unforgettable days, they were as close as brothers and cooperated with each other. During the day, the People's Army vigilantly defended the sky; at night, the Volunteer Army patrolled the camps of both units all night long. Whenever there was an enemy air raid, the People's Army always invited the Volunteer Army to their air raid shelters. Zheng Qi said: "Today, after watching the 'Comrades-in-Arms' performed by my comrades, I felt as if I was there, it was so touching!" Indeed, at such a moment, no one could remain calm! Jin Kezhi, a former Volunteer Army hero, excitedly wrote a poem: "The friendship between China and North Korea is as deep as the sea, the hearts of the people of the two countries are linked; closer than siblings, higher than the Kunlun Mountains; higher than the sky and deeper than the sea, forever and ever!" Many actors from the Liaoning Provincial Song and Dance Troupe, who had performed in North Korea for the Korean People's Army, wrote articles recalling those unforgettable scenes of friendship.

The distinguished guests of the Korean People's Army Ensemble paid special attention to the former Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers who had shed blood on Korean soil and their families. On the second day of the Ensemble's arrival in Shenyang, they braved the cold wind to pay their respects and lay a wreath at the Shenyang Beiling Volunteer Army Martyrs Cemetery. When all the members of the delegation observed a moment of silence in front of the martyrs' tombs, many shed tears in front of the portraits and relics of martyrs such as Yang Gensi, Yang Lian, Sun Zhanyuan, Qiu Shaoyun, and Huang Jiguang. That evening, the comrades of the Ensemble met with the families of the former Volunteer Army martyrs. They surrounded Mother Cai, the mother of a martyr, expressing endless affection with thousands of words. Some pointed to their hearts and said: "I am your son!" Some female comrades told Mother Cai: "I am your daughter!"

On the day before leaving Shenyang, the Korean People's Army Ensemble also took advantage of the gaps in their tight performance schedule to visit a hospital in a certain place to extend their regards to the recuperating former Volunteer Army soldiers. When Major General Zhang Ruihuan personally covered Sun Guihai, a recuperating former Volunteer Army soldier, with a blanket in the ward, Sun Guihai said excitedly: "I will never forget all the care the Korean people gave me. Now, whenever I think of this friendship, I gain strength." Major General Zhang Ruihuan said: "The Korean people will never forget you!"

On the morning of December 4th, the Korean People's Army Ensemble was about to return home by train from Shenyang. On the square of Shenyang Railway Station, gongs and drums were beating, and firecrackers were set off; the guests and hosts warmly embraced and danced hand in hand. As the train whistled and slowly left the station, the slogans "Goodbye, comrades!" and "The people of China and North Korea will advance side by side in the great cause of socialist construction and in the common struggle to continue opposing American imperialist aggression!" resounded throughout the station.

    再见，英雄朝鲜人民的使者
    新华社记者　佟希文　李健羽
    12月3日傍晚，沈阳“八一”剧场灯火通明，欢声雷动。当紫红色的帷幕徐徐落下时，浸沉在中朝骨肉情谊热烈气氛中的观众们，一面热情地鼓掌，一面带着依依惜别的心情伫立在座席旁，人人舍不得离去。这是朝鲜人民军协奏团访华演出闭幕式演出后的情景。贵宾们满载着盛誉和友谊即将回国了。
    在朝鲜人民军协奏团到达沈阳访问演出的那天，在沈阳的前中国人民志愿军战士、抗美援朝中的老担架员、曾经到过朝鲜访问演出的文艺工作者们，以及沈阳市千千万万的人民多么激动呀，他们佩戴着朝鲜政府授予自己的勋章、奖章，一早就冒着清晨的寒风，手执花束、彩旗，带着锣鼓，来到车站欢迎亲人。1日晚上，他们又以无比喜悦的心情，在剧场里欣赏着战友们的精彩演出。当舞台上出现了反映中朝两国战士用鲜血互相支持坚持反击美帝国主义侵略军的舞蹈“战友”的动人场面时，前志愿军二级战斗英雄郑起的眼睛湿润了。他想起了1953年春天，他们与朝鲜人民军的一支高射炮部队共同守卫金日成元帅故乡万景台时的情景。在那难忘的日子里，他们亲如兄弟，相互配合。白天，人民军警惕地保卫着天空；晚上，志愿军彻夜在两支部队的营地巡逻。遇有敌机空袭，人民军总是请志愿军到他们的防空洞去。郑起说：“今天，看了战友们演出的‘战友’，我好像身临其境，太感动人了。”是的，在这样的时刻，谁的心情也不能平静啊！一位前志愿军英雄金克智激动地挥笔写诗道：“中朝友谊似海深，两国人民心连心；说亲胜过亲兄弟，说高高过山昆仑；比天高来比海深，千年万年永不分！”曾经到过朝鲜给朝鲜人民军演出的辽宁省歌舞团，许多演员写了文章回忆那些难忘的友谊情景。
    朝鲜人民军协奏团的贵宾们，特别关怀在朝鲜土地上留过鲜血的前中国人民志愿军战士和他们的家属。协奏团到沈阳的第二天，他们便冒着寒风到沈阳北陵志愿军烈士陵园去凭吊并敬献花圈。全体团员在烈士墓前致默哀时，许多人在杨根思、杨连弟、孙占元、丘少云、黄继光等烈士的遗像、遗物前，洒下了热泪。当天晚上，协奏团的同志们与前志愿军烈士的家属会面了。他们围着烈士的母亲蔡老大娘，表示了千言万语说不尽的无限深情，有的人指着自己的心说：“我就是你的儿子！”有的女同志告诉蔡老妈妈说：“我就是你的女儿！”
    朝鲜人民军协奏团在离开沈阳的前一天，还利用紧张演出的空隙，到了某地医院慰问前志愿军的休养员。当张瑞焕少将在病房里亲手给前志愿军战士休养员孙桂海盖被子时，孙桂海激动地说：“我始终不忘朝鲜人民给我的一切照顾。现在，我一想起这种友谊，就增加了力量。”张瑞焕少将说：“朝鲜人民永远也忘不了你们！”
    12月4日清晨，朝鲜人民军协奏团从沈阳乘车即将归国了。在沈阳车站的广场上，锣鼓喧天，鞭炮齐鸣；宾主热情地拥抱，携手起舞。当列车一声长鸣徐徐驶离车站时，“再见吧，战友！”“中朝两国人民在社会主义建设的伟大事业中，在继续反对美帝国主义侵略的共同斗争中并肩前进！”的口号声响彻车站上空。
