One Year

Although the Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant is a relatively large factory, in the past, almost half of the processes were done by hand. Since the beginning of this year, all the workers in the factory have been vigorously engaged in the technical revolution and technical innovation, which has brought about significant changes in the factory's production outlook. From January to November, the output of transformers, electric motors, DC motors, steam turbine generators, and capacitors produced to support grain and steel increased by 32% to 100% compared to the same period last year. Every product leaving the factory was up to standard. This year, the factory also successfully trial-produced 89 new products, of which high-grade, large-scale, precision, and cutting-edge products accounted for 47 items.

	This is the first assembly line built by workers in the shearing and punching workshop - the automatic assembly line for transformer cores. It replaces eight manual operation processes, increases output by two and a half times, reduces workers by three-quarters, and ensures quality, quantity, and safety.

	A DC generator with advanced level, supporting a large-scale 825 rolling mill, is being created. Workshop leaders and workers are studying on-site the use of wrapped wire instead of bakelite pads to manufacture rotors, saving man-hours and materials.

	A large number of workers in this factory have been promoted to engineers this year. Ge Zhicheng (third from left) and Shang Qiang (first from left), engineers from worker backgrounds, are discussing with design engineers how to improve the structure of new generators.

	Workers in the steam turbine generator workshop participate in production management, strengthening the coordination of various processes, reducing the production cycle of 25,000 kW steam turbine generators from 80 days to 14 days. Workers are studying and formulating plans with planners to shorten the production cycle of steam turbine generators.

	Zhu Shude, a female worker in the wiring workshop, was previously considered unable to speak, unable to use her brain, unable to do her job, and unable to return to Shanghai after leaving. After a year of training, she has become capable in every aspect. This year, she and her comrades have researched and developed more than 20 innovation projects. They are also creating a new machine.

    一年间
    上海电机厂虽然是一个比较大的工厂，但过去用手工操作的工序几乎占一半。今年以来，全厂职工大搞技术革命和技术革新，使工厂生产面貌起了重大的变化。1至11月，他们为支援粮钢而生产的变压器、电动机、直流电机、汽轮发电机和电容器，产量分别比去年同期增长百分之三十二至百分之百。出厂的产品台台合格。这个厂今年还试制成功了八十九项新产品，其中高级、大型、精密、尖端产品就占四十七项　新华社记者　杨溥涛、左家忠、张　萍摄
    这是剪冲车间工人建成的第一条流水线——变压器铁芯自动流水线。它代替了八道手工操作工序，产量提高两倍半，工人减少四分之三，并且做到保质、保量、保安全
    具有先进水平的、为大型八二五轧钢机配套的直流发电机正在创造中。车间领导和工人正在现场研究用扎腊线代替胶木垫块来制造转子，节省了工时和材料
    这个厂今年已有一大批工人被提拔为工程师。工人出身的工程师戈智诚（左三）、商强（左一）等正在和设计工程师们一起讨论改进新型发电机的结构
    汽轮发电机车间的工人参加生产管理，加强了各道工序的配合，使两万五千瓩汽轮发电机的生产周期由八十天缩短到十四天。工人们正和计划员一起研究、制订缩短汽轮发电机的生产周期计划
    线图车间女工朱淑德，过去大家说她话讲不来，脑筋动不来，工作做不来，上海去了回不来。经过一年的锻炼，已经变成样样来了。今年她和同志们研究成革新项目二十多个。她们又在创造一台新的机器
