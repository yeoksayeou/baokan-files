Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, 15th: The people of the French-occupied areas of Algeria, defying the bloody suppression by the French colonial military and police for days, are shouting slogans of "Fight to the death" and persisting in the patriotic and just struggle against French colonial rule.

In the Casbah district of Algiers, which has been surrounded by heavy French colonial forces and subjected to days of frantic suppression, Algerians gathered several times on the 14th to fight bravely against the colonial military and police. In the early morning, more than 5,000 patriots held a demonstration at the foot of the Casbah mountain. They fearlessly raised the Algerian flag in front of the guns and grenade launchers of the colonial military and police, shouting slogans such as "Algeria for Algerians," "Abbas in power," and vowing "Rather die unyielding than give up the struggle!" The colonial army dispatched helicopters, used tear gas and grenades, and savagely beat and slaughtered patriots. Demonstrators fought bravely against the colonial military and police with wooden sticks. Many veiled Arab women also participated in the struggle.

Large numbers of French colonial military and police conducted "house-to-house searches" and frantic arrests in the Casbah district for the second consecutive day. They brutally beat patriots and even rushed into hospitals to arrest patriots who had been injured in the demonstrations in previous days. People resolutely fought back against the atrocities of the colonial military and police. On the afternoon of the 14th, Casbah residents gathered again in a group of more than 2,000 people and fought with the colonial military and police. They planned to break through the blockade of the colonial military and police and join Algerian workers in another nearby district.

The colonial authorities adopted inhuman means, cut off the food supply to the Casbah district, and prohibited all reporters from entering, strictly blockading the news. But the residents of Casbah did not yield. They painted over the reactionary slogans written by the colonial army on the walls and wrote revolutionary slogans such as "Long live the National Liberation Front." They built roadblocks with stones and wood to confront the machine guns and barbed wire of the colonial military and police, and held a general strike to protest the atrocities of the colonial army. On the evening of the 14th, Casbah patriots held demonstrations and parades all night for the second consecutive night. On the morning of the 15th, more than 1,500 people broke through the obstacles of the military and police, raised the Algerian flag, and held a demonstration against French colonial rule in Algiers' Government Square. Facing the large number of fully armed French paratroopers and twelve armored vehicles hastily dispatched by the colonial authorities, they shouted slogans such as "Long live the National Liberation Front." Algerians in other areas of Algiers also continued their patriotic struggle on the 14th. In the Bab El Oued district, demonstrators fought with the colonial military and police. In the Government Square in the city center, several thousand patriots held a demonstration. They shouted slogans such as "Algeria for Algerians," "Long live Abbas," in response to the military and police's order for the masses to "disperse." The colonial military and police used grenades and tear gas to suppress the demonstrating masses and opened fire on the patriots.

In Bone, a seaport in eastern Algeria, the French colonial army once again opened fire to massacre demonstrating crowds. More than 2,000 Algerians held a funeral on the 14th for the three martyrs who had been killed by the colonialists two days earlier. They buried the bodies of the martyrs, raised the Algerian flag, and marched again from the cemetery to the city center, where the colonial army opened fire to suppress them and made arrests. According to Agence France-Presse, two demonstrators were killed and four were injured. The colonial military authorities in Bone announced on the 15th that they were prohibiting gatherings of more than ten people on the streets and limiting funeral processions to no more than one hundred people.

In addition, in Oran, the second largest city in Algeria, under the military control of the colonial military and police, patriotic Algerians continue to strike.

The just struggle of the Algerian people has received the support and solidarity of the French working people. The French General Confederation of Labor called on French workers on the 15th to organize demonstrations and hold strikes to force the French government to immediately end its bloody colonial rule in Algeria. The French "League for Human Rights" and the "National Federation of Exiled Political Prisoners and Resistance Fighters" issued statements respectively, condemning the De Gaulle government's massacre of the people in the French-occupied areas of Algeria. The statement of the "League for Human Rights" expressed "angry protest against the bloody reprisals taken against Algerian demonstrators and demands that the culprits be punished." The French Communist Party's newspaper *L'Humanité*, in an editorial, condemned the French government's policy toward Algeria, and pointed out that recent events in Algeria show that the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic has the support of the vast majority of the Algerian people.

    阿尔及利亚法占区人民宁死不屈斗争到底
    各地群众继续示威游行罢工反击殖民军警血腥镇压
    新华社15日讯　阿尔及尔消息：阿尔及利亚法占区的人民不顾法国殖民军警连日的血腥镇压，高呼“誓死战斗”的口号，坚持反抗法国殖民统治的爱国正义斗争。
    在法国殖民者以重兵包围、连日疯狂进行镇压的阿尔及尔卡斯巴区，阿尔及利亚人14日几次集结起来与殖民军警英勇搏斗。清晨，五千多爱国者在卡斯巴山下举行示威。他们在殖民军警的枪口和掷弹筒前，毫无畏惧地高举阿尔及利亚国旗，高呼“阿尔及利亚人的阿尔及利亚”、“阿巴斯执政”等口号，并宣誓“宁死不屈，斗争到底！”殖民军出动了直升飞机，使用了催泪弹和手榴弹，野蛮地殴打屠杀爱国者。示威者以木棍与殖民军警英勇战斗。许多戴面纱的阿拉伯妇女也参加了斗争。
    大批法国殖民军警在卡斯巴区接连第二天进行“逐屋搜查”和疯狂的逮捕。他们残酷地殴打爱国者，甚至冲进医院逮捕在前几天示威中受伤的爱国者。人们对殖民军警的暴行给予坚决反击。14日下午，卡斯巴居民又集结起二千多人的队伍，同殖民军警进行搏斗。他们打算冲破殖民军警的封锁同附近另一个区的阿尔及利亚工人会合。
    殖民当局采取灭绝人性的手段，断绝了对卡斯巴区食物的供应，并且禁止一切记者入内，严密封锁了消息。但卡斯巴居民并没有屈服，他们涂掉了殖民军队在墙壁上写的反动标语，而写上“民族解放阵线万岁”等革命的标语，他们用石块木头筑起路障同殖民军警的机关枪和铁丝网对峙，并且举行总罢工抗议殖民军的暴行。14日晚上，卡斯巴爱国者又连续第二夜通宵举行示威游行。15日上午，有一千五百多人突破军警的阻拦，高举阿尔及利亚国旗，在阿尔及尔政府广场举行反对法国殖民统治的示威。他们面对着殖民当局慌忙调来的大批全副武装的法国伞兵和十二辆装甲车，高呼“民族解放阵线万岁”等口号。阿尔及尔市其他地区的阿尔及利亚人14日也继续坚持爱国斗争。在巴布艾乌区，示威者同殖民军警进行搏斗。在市中心政府广场好几千爱国者举行示威。他们高呼“阿尔及利亚人的阿尔及利亚”、“阿巴斯万岁”的口号，来回答军警要群众“解散”的命令。殖民军警使用手榴弹、催泪弹镇压示威群众，并且向爱国者开枪。
    在阿尔及利亚东部海港波尼，法国殖民军又一次开枪屠杀示威群众。两千多阿尔及利亚人14日为前两天被殖民者杀害的三位烈士举行葬礼。他们埋葬了烈士的尸体，举起了阿尔及利亚的国旗，从墓地向市区再次举行示威游行，殖民军队开枪镇压，并进行逮捕。据法新社承认，打死了两个示威者，打伤了四人。波尼殖民军当局15日宣布，禁止街头上十人以上的聚合，并限制送葬的行列不得超过一百人。
  此外，在殖民军警军事管制下的阿尔及利亚第二个大城市奥兰，爱国的阿尔及利亚人仍然坚持罢工。
    阿尔及利亚人民正义的斗争得到法国劳动人民的支持和声援。法国总工会15日号召法国工人组织示威游行和举行罢工，迫使法国政府立刻结束对阿尔及利亚的血腥殖民统治。法国“人权联盟”和“被流放政治犯和抵抗战士全国联合会”分别发表声明，谴责戴高乐政府对阿尔及利亚法占区人民的屠杀。“人权联盟”的声明表示“愤怒地抗议对阿尔及利亚示威者所采取的血腥报复行为，并要求惩办祸首”。法国共产党机关报《人道报》在社论中谴责法国政府对阿尔及利亚的政策，并指出，阿尔及利亚最近发生的事件表明阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府获得阿尔及利亚广大人民的支持。
