Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao Dispatch: The Qingdao light industrial system is actively purchasing, transporting, and producing raw materials to prepare for producing more products next year.

The Qingdao Municipal Bureau of Light Industry convened a meeting of supply and marketing cadres, specifically deploying the raw material preparation work for next year, and urging various factories to formulate plans and measures for preparing raw materials. The Qingdao Paper Mill organized more than thirty employees, led by the factory director, to seize the good opportunity after the "Three Autumns" to vigorously carry out the acquisition of raw materials and the production of pulp. From November to early December, it had already acquired more than 3,100 tons of various raw materials. The factory also organized cadres and veteran workers to go deep into the various pulping points in the pulping base to study and improve the quality of grass pulp. After more than a month of efforts, the impurities in the grass pulp have been reduced by more than 50% compared to the original, and the pulp recovery rate has increased from about 30% to 40% to 50%. They are also actively trying to increase new pulping bases and strive to put them into production ahead of schedule.

Various factories are also vigorously carrying out short-distance transportation to transport raw materials to the factories in a timely manner. Many factories have established professional and shock transportation teams. The Qingdao Brewery organized a professional transportation team and vigorously carried out mass shock transportation. Factory and workshop cadres took the lead and engaged in transportation with the workers. Xu Chenglong, deputy director and engineer of the Wood Comprehensive Processing Plant, worked with the workers to successfully trial-produce a winch for transporting materials within the factory, which greatly improved transportation efficiency and ensured that materials were transported to the workshop in a timely manner.

While ensuring the completion of current production tasks, various factories are also actively increasing production and saving raw materials through technical innovation and technical revolution. The polyvinyl chloride workshop built by the employees of the No. 9 Rubber Factory with their own hands has been put into production. Recently, they started to build a new synthetic rubber workshop. The Wood Comprehensive Processing Plant took various measures and saved 116 cubic meters of wood in November alone.

    青岛轻工业系统积极准备原料材料
    据新华社青岛电　青岛市轻工业系统积极采购、调运、生产原料材料，为明年生产更多的产品作好物资准备。
    青岛市轻工业局曾召开供销干部会议，对明年原料材料准备工作进行了专门部署，并督促各厂制定了准备原料的计划和措施。青岛造纸厂组织了三十多名职工，由厂长挂帅，抓住“三秋”以后的大好时机，大搞原料材料收购和纸浆生产，从11月到12月上旬，已收购各种原料材料三千一百多吨。这个厂还组织干部和老工人深入制浆基地各个制浆点，研究改进草浆质量。经过一个多月努力，草浆的杂质已比原来减少了50％以上，收浆率由30％左右提高到40％至50％。他们还积极设法增加新的制浆基地，并力争提前投入生产。
    各厂还大搞短途运输，及时地把原料材料运到厂内。不少工厂成立了专业性和突击性的运输队伍。青岛啤酒厂组织了专业运输队和大搞群众性的突击运输。厂和车间的干部带头和职工一起搞运输。木材综合加工厂副厂长兼工程师徐呈龙和工人一起，试制成功了厂内运料用的绞车，大大提高了运输效率，保证了材料及时运进车间。
    各厂在保证当前生产任务完成的同时，还通过技术革新和技术革命，积极增产节约原料材料。橡胶九厂职工自己动手，建立的聚氯乙烯车间，已投入生产。最近他们又动手新建合成橡胶车间。木材综合加工厂采取各种措施，11月份一个月就节约木材一百一十六立方米。
