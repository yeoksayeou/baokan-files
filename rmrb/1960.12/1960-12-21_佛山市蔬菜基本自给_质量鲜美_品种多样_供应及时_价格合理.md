    Foshan City Basically Achieves Self-Sufficiency in Vegetables
    High Quality and Freshness, Diverse Varieties, Timely Supply, Reasonable Prices
    (Our newspaper, Guangzhou, 20th) The Foshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has taken measures from various aspects to develop vegetable production in the suburbs and do a good job in the purchase and supply of vegetables, so that the city's vegetable supply has achieved basic self-sufficiency, and the quality is high and fresh, the varieties are diverse, the supply is timely, and the prices are reasonable, which satisfies both producers and consumers.
    Before 1958, more than 90% of the vegetables consumed by residents of Foshan City were supplied by neighboring counties, and last year only 70% could be self-sufficient. This year, the Municipal Party Committee has, on the one hand, conscientiously implemented the policy of suburban production serving the city, vigorously developing suburban vegetable production while vigorously engaging in grain production; on the other hand, it has mobilized urban residents to reclaim wasteland and plant vegetables. Therefore, since the beginning of this year, there has been a fundamental change in the production and supply of vegetables. The city's vegetable market volume from January to October increased by more than 40% compared with the same period last year. In addition to ensuring market supply, commercial departments have also carried out a large amount of processing and storage. By the end of October, the vegetables processed and stored in the urban area alone had reached four million catties, which is close to the city's population's need for one month.
    In order to earnestly grasp vegetable production and supply work, the Foshan Municipal Party Committee decided that the secretary in charge of agriculture should personally take charge and see things through to the end. It also decided that the suburban communes, brigades, and production teams should have a secretary or production team leader specifically in charge of vegetable production, and each production team also established a specialized vegetable production team. In terms of production management, the Municipal Party Committee emphasized intensive cultivation to greatly improve land use efficiency, advocating intercropping, interplanting, overlapping planting, and crop rotation. Vegetable arable land is generally required to be replanted five to six times, and in many cases seven to eight times; each vegetable field is interplanted with two to four kinds of vegetables to ensure that another kind is planted immediately after one is harvested, so that vegetable production is constant throughout the year. At the same time, the rotation of rice and vegetables is widely promoted, which can not only ensure high yields of grain and vegetables, but also reduce pests and diseases. After these measures were taken, the potential of the land was fully utilized, and the unit area yield of vegetables increased by 44% compared with last year.
    With the increase in the quality requirements of cultivation and the increase in the number of plantings, the existing labor force for vegetable production is far from meeting the needs of production development. Therefore, the Municipal Party Committee concentrated its efforts on carrying out technical transformation of agriculture this spring, vigorously developing self-flowing irrigation and mechanical irrigation, and built twelve large-scale irrigation and drainage stations with a total power generation capacity of more than 1,900 kilowatts. In addition, 25 24-horsepower water pumps were assembled, so that more than 80% of the arable land in the suburbs has realized mechanical irrigation and self-flowing irrigation. In terms of transportation, the Municipal Party Committee mobilized all industries in the city to support the suburbs in engaging in transportation vehicle and boat modernization, which solved the transportation problems of fertilizer to the fields and vegetables to the market. This has freed more than 4,000 laborers from the heavy labor of watering and carrying, and invested them in field management to implement intensive cultivation. Moreover, it has basically solved the drought and flood disasters that threaten vegetable production the most, ensuring the development of vegetable production.
    While strengthening the leadership of vegetable production, the Foshan Municipal Party Committee has also strengthened the leadership of vegetable supply and storage work, achieving a balanced supply throughout the year and adjusting between peak and slack seasons. Commercial cadres stationed in the teams, based on the vegetable production of the communes and brigades and the needs of the market, contacted the purchasing stations and the market to plan the varieties and quantities of vegetables to be put on the market each month and each day; and adopted the methods of field purchase and direct allocation to transport vegetables directly to the market or canteens. In this way, the vegetables on the market are balanced in quantity, high in quality and fresh, diverse in variety, and timely in supply. The Foshan Municipal Party Committee has also formulated a plan for the year's vegetable supply work based on the characteristics of the peak and slack seasons of vegetable production, so as to achieve a balanced supply and adjust between peak and slack seasons, so that the vegetable supply is not affected by seasonal factors. In the peak season of vegetable production, the Municipal Party Committee adopted the method of "supplementing the slack with the peak," proposed reasonable arrangements for supply, a large amount of processing, and a planned organization of processing and storage of vegetables. In addition to the processing and storage by commercial departments and commune canteens, the city's organs, schools, factories, etc. are widely mobilized to carry out processing and storage. At present, the processed and stored vegetables have laid a material foundation for the supply of vegetables in the coming off-season. (Attached picture)

They have already planted various vegetables such as cucumbers, cowpeas, tomatoes, and celery in the 53 greenhouses built on the sunny slopes of the mountains.

    佛山市蔬菜基本自给
    质量鲜美　品种多样　供应及时　价格合理
    本报广州20日电　中共佛山市委从多方面采取措施发展郊区蔬菜生产，做好蔬菜的收购供应工作，使全市蔬菜供应达到基本自给，而且质量鲜美，品种多样，供应及时，价格合理，生产者和消费者都很满意。
    佛山市在1958年以前，居民食用的蔬菜90％以上靠邻县供应，去年也仅能自给70％。今年开始，市委一方面认真贯彻了郊区生产为城市服务的方针，在大搞粮食生产的同时，大力发展郊区蔬菜生产；另一方面发动市区居民开荒种植蔬菜。因此，今年以来，蔬菜生产和供应情况有了根本改变。全市1至10月份的蔬菜上市量，比去年同期增长40％以上。除保证市场供应外，商业部门还大量进行加工储存，到10月底为止，仅市区内加工储存的蔬菜已达四百万斤，接近全市人口一个月的需要量。
    为了认真抓好蔬菜生产和供应工作，中共佛山市委除决定由农业书记亲自挂帅，一手抓到底外，并决定郊区公社、大队和生产小队，都有一个书记或生产队长专门抓蔬菜生产，各生产队还建立了蔬菜生产专业队伍。在生产管理方面，市委强调精耕细作，大力提高土地使用效率，提倡复种、间种、套种、轮种。蔬菜耕地一般要求复种五至六次，多的七至八次；每块菜地都间种、套种二至四种蔬菜，做到收割了一种紧接着再种上另一种，使蔬菜生产常年不断。同时，普遍推行水稻与蔬菜轮种，这样既可保证粮菜高产，又可减少虫害。采取这些措施以后，土地潜力得到了充分发挥，蔬菜单位面积产量比去年增长44％。
    随着耕作质量要求的提高，和种植次数的增加，生产蔬菜的现有劳动力，远不能满足生产发展的需要。因此，市委在今年春季就集中力量对农业进行技术改造，大搞自流排灌和机械排灌，建设了十二个大型排灌站，发电能力共一千九百多瓩。另外还装配了二十五部二十四马力的抽水机，使郊区80％以上的耕地都实现了机械排灌和自流排灌。在运输方面，市委动员了全市各行业支援郊区搞运输车船化，解决了肥料下地和蔬菜上市的运输问题。这样就使四千多个劳动力从繁重的车水和挑运的劳动中解放出来，投入田间管理，实行精耕细作。而且基本上解决了威胁蔬菜生产最大的旱、涝灾害，保证了蔬菜生产的发展。
    佛山市委在加强蔬菜生产领导的同时，还加强了对蔬菜供应和贮存工作的领导，做到了常年供应均衡，旺淡调剂。驻队的商业干部根据公社、大队蔬菜生产的情况和市场需要情况，与收购站和市场取得联系，有计划地安排每月、每天蔬菜上市的品种和数量；并且采取田头收购、直线调拨的办法，把蔬菜直接调运到市场或食堂。这样，就使上市蔬菜做到数量均衡，质量鲜美，品种多样，供应及时。佛山市委又根据蔬菜生产有旺、淡季节的特点，制订了全年蔬菜供应工作的规划，做到供应均衡，旺淡调剂，使蔬菜供应不受季节影响。在蔬菜生产旺季，市委采取“以旺补淡”的办法，提出合理安排供应，大量加工，有计划地组织加工储备蔬菜。除商业部门和公社食堂加工储备以外，还广泛发动市内机关、学校、工厂等进行加工储存。目前，加工贮存的蔬菜，已为明年淡季的蔬菜供应打下了物质基础。（附图片）
