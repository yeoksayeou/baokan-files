Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai dispatch: Workers at the Shanghai First Transportation Bureau's truck repair factory have rejuvenated over 600 automobiles that were due to be scrapped in the past two years, increasing transportation capacity.

　　Since liberation, the Shanghai First Transportation Bureau has continuously increased its number of new freight trucks. However, many of the original old and dilapidated vehicles have not been thoroughly renovated. Most of them have been in use for more than 20 years, and some for over 30 years. Their load-carrying capacity has been continuously weakening, and they often require repairs, resulting in a vehicle availability rate as low as 70%. These old vehicles come in dozens of brands and nearly a hundred model years, with a wide variety of parts. Workers at the truck repair factory manufacture their own standardized engine, transmission, steering gear and other automotive assemblies to replace the corresponding assemblies in the old vehicles. At the same time, they fully utilize the chassis, beams, front and rear axles, etc. on the old vehicles that can still be used, after repairing and standardizing them, and only replace them with new ones when they can no longer be used.

　　Vigorously renovating old vehicles has significant meaning. First, the renovated vehicles, due to their powerful engines, not only restore their original carrying capacity but also expand their towing capacity, rapidly increasing transport capacity. Many old vehicles that originally struggled to carry 3.5 tons of cargo can now carry 4 tons after renovation and can also tow trailers carrying more than 10 tons of cargo. Second, standardizing the renovation of old vehicles with self-made automotive assemblies allows each assembly to be interchangeable, greatly facilitating vehicle maintenance and repair work and increasing the overall vehicle availability rate to over 96%. At the same time, it changes the past phenomenon of complex vehicle brands and model years, which is conducive to achieving complete self-sufficiency in vehicle parts. Third, more vehicles can be produced with less materials, time, equipment, and manpower. Calculating only the materials, an average renovation of an old vehicle saves more than two-thirds of the steel required to manufacture a new vehicle.

    上海积极更新旧汽车
    据新华社上海电　上海市第一交通运输局货车修理厂职工，两年来使六百多辆应该报废的汽车返老还童，增加了运力。
    解放后，上海市第一交通运输局新的货运汽车不断增加。但是不少原有破旧车辆没有得到彻底改造，其中大部分已经使用二十年以上，有的超过三十年，载货能力不断减弱，经常需要修理，车辆完好率低至70％。这些旧车分为数十种厂牌、近百种年型，配件各式各样。货车修理厂的职工就自己制造规格统一的发动机、变速箱、方向机等各种汽车总成，调换旧车的相应总成；同时对旧车上可以继续利用的底盘、大梁、前后桥等，经过整修、统一规格，加以充分利用，直到不能再用时才换新的。
    大搞旧车更新具有重大意义。首先，更新后的汽车，由于发动机功率大，不仅恢复了原有自载重，还扩大了拖载能力，使运力迅速增加。很多原来装载三吨半货物就跑不动的旧车，更新后能装四吨，还能拖带载货十吨多的挂车。第二，统一以自制汽车总成改造旧车，各总成可以互换，大大便利了车辆保修工作，使全局车辆完好率提高到96％以上；同时改变了过去车辆厂牌和年型繁杂的现象，有利于实现车辆配件全部自给。第三，可以用更少的材料、时间、设备、人力造出更多的车辆。仅以材料计算，平均更新一辆旧车比造一辆新车节约钢材三分之二以上。
