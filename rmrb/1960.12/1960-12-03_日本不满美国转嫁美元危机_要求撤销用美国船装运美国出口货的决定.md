    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd. Japanese monopoly capital is dissatisfied with the US practice of passing on the dollar crisis to Japan. On December 1st, the Japanese government protested to the United States against the US government's forcing Japan to use American ships to transport American goods it purchases.

    According to Kyodo News, the US Department of Commerce recently required Toyota Motor Corporation of Japan to use American ships to transport the complete set of machinery and equipment it purchased from the United States.

    The *Asahi Shimbun* reported today that the Japanese government's protest was submitted to the US government through the Japanese Embassy in the United States. The Japanese government demanded that the US government rescind this unreasonable request.

    According to the *Yomiuri Shimbun* today, this measure by the US government to pass on the dollar crisis has made people in the Japanese shipping industry feel uneasy. They worry that, in order to solve the dollar crisis, the United States will demand the comprehensive use of American ships to transport goods purchased from the United States. In this way, the Japanese shipping industry will suffer serious losses, because shipping revenue on the Japan-US route accounts for a quarter of Japan's total shipping revenue. The *Yomiuri Shimbun* said that people in the Japanese shipping industry have agreed that if the United States formally decides to comprehensively use American ships, they will unite and call on Western European countries to take the same steps and resolutely confront the United States.

    日本不满美国转嫁美元危机
    要求撤销用美国船装运美国出口货的决定
    新华社2日讯　东京消息：美国向日本转嫁美元危机的做法已引起日本垄断资本的不满。日本政府1日向美国提出抗议，反对美国政府强迫日本在购买美国货物时必须用美国轮船运输。
    据共同社报道，美国政府商务部最近要求日本丰田汽车公司必须使用美国轮船运输它从美国购买的全套机械设备。
   《朝日新闻》今天报道，日本政府的抗议是通过日本驻美国大使馆提交美国政府的。日本政府要求美国政府撤销这种无理的要求。
    据《读卖新闻》今天报道，美国政府这种转嫁美元危机的措施使日本船运界人士感到惶恐不安。他们担心，美国为了解救美元危机将要求全面使用美国轮船运输向美国购买的货物的措施。这样，日本船运界将遭受严重损失，因为日美航线的船运收入占日本全部船运收入的四分之一。《读卖新闻》说，日本船运界人士已经商定，如果美国正式决定全面使用美国轮船时，他们将团结起来，呼吁西欧各国采取同一步骤，坚决同美国对抗。
