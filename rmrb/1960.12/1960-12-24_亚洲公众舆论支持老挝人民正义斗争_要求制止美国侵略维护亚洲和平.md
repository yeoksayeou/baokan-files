Asian Public Opinion Supports the Lao People's Just Struggle
Demands a Halt to U.S. Aggression and Upholds Asian Peace

    (By this newspaper's staff reporter) Asian countries' public opinion has widely condemned the crimes of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in their aggression and interference in Laos, and supports the Lao people's just struggle to win peace, neutrality, defend national unity.

    The Japan Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee, the Japan Peace Committee, and the Japan-Vietnam Friendship Association issued a joint statement on the 20th, strongly protesting the U.S. imperialists' provocation of the Lao civil war and interference in Laos.

    The statement condemned that the U.S. imperialists have not only trampled on the Lao people's desire for peace, neutrality, and independence, but also created a dangerous international tension in Southeast Asia, especially in Indochina.

    The statement expressed heartfelt support for the Lao patriotic people led by the Phouma government, Captain Kong Le, and the Lao fighting forces.

    The All-India Peace Council issued a statement on the Lao situation, pointing out that the United States and members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization are interfering in Lao internal affairs, threatening peace in Asia and the world.

    The All-India Peace Council called on the governments and peoples of all countries to support the Phouma government and prevent peace in Asia and the world from being threatened.

    The statement said that the imperialist elements support the Lao rebel groups, attempting to overthrow the legitimate government of Prince Phouma, which implements a policy of peaceful neutrality in accordance with the spirit of the Geneva Accords. The statement said that the consolidated unity of Lao patriotic forces is contrary to the interests of imperialist countries, especially the United States and its Southeast Asia Treaty Organization partners. The statement pointed out that the Southeast Asia Military Group Organization is a constant source of tension, threatening the freedom and security of the people of Southeast Asian countries.

    The National Council of the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union Federation, in its statement, representing 2.7 million members and all Indonesian workers, strongly condemned the U.S. and members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization for their interference and military aggression against Laos.

    The statement called for a meeting of the participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference and the resumption of the activities of the Lao International Commission.

    The statement said that the U.S. intervention and armed aggression against Laos further exposed the true face of the U.S. aggressive policy. The U.S. has been implementing this aggressive policy against those countries that are unwilling to yield to the interests of U.S. imperialism.

    The statement pointed out that the U.S. and members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization not only command the Phoumi-Nosavan counter-revolutionary rebel group and arm them with modern weapons, but also send their troops to Laos. The statement said that, therefore, the current actions of the U.S. and members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in Laos not only violate the right of other countries to decide their own internal and foreign policies, but also violate the Bandung Principles and the 1954 Geneva Accords on the Lao issue.

    The Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace issued a statement on the 21st regarding the current serious situation in Laos, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization countries for their aggressive activities and interference in Laos.

    The statement pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' provision of weapons and ammunition to Lao rebels and the direct participation of Southeast Asia Treaty Organization countries in the war of aggression are the root cause of escalating tension in the region and undermining peace in Southeast Asia.

    The statement called on the participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference and the International Commission for Supervision and Control to be concerned about safeguarding peace in Laos. The statement pointed out that the Burmese people always support the Lao people who are fighting for peace.
