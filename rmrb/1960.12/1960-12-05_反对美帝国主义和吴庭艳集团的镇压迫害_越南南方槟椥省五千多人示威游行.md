    Opposing U.S. Imperialism and the Repression and Persecution by the Ngo Dinh Diem Clique
    More Than 5,000 People in Ben Tre Province, South Vietnam, Demonstrate
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 3rd: People in various parts of South Vietnam are continuously launching massive waves of struggle against the barbaric massacres and persecutions by U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique.
    According to a report in today's Vietnamese newspaper "Nhan Dan," more than 5,000 people in Ben Tre Province (including 1,500 family members of South Vietnamese soldiers) held a vigorous demonstration on October 15th against the U.S.-Ngo group. Faced with the people's demonstration, the U.S.-Ngo group's henchmen were extremely panicked. They sent military police to suppress and arrest some people. The demonstrators were even more indignant and flocked to the residence of the pseudo-"Provincial Governor," angrily demanding that the pseudo-"Provincial Governor" agree to "stop the terror 'sweeps'; stop shelling villages; guarantee that the people can live in peace; allow the husbands and sons who have been forced into the army to return home; and allow the people to freely visit the imprisoned," and also demanded the release of the arrested masses.
    Under the pressure of the people's struggle, the pseudo-"Provincial Governor" was forced to accept the people's protest letter and promised to resolve the demands raised by the people. According to incomplete statistics, in the past three months, more than 100,000 people in various parts of Ben Tre Province have participated in the struggle against the U.S.-Ngo group.

    反对美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团的镇压迫害
    越南南方槟椥省五千多人示威游行
    据新华社河内3日电　越南南方各地的人民接连不断地掀起声势浩大的斗争浪潮，反对美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团的野蛮屠杀和迫害。
    据越南《人民报》今天报道，槟椥省五千多人（其中包括南越士兵的家属一千五百人）在10月15日举行了轰轰烈烈的反对美吴集团的示威游行。在群众的示威面前，美吴集团的爪牙们极为惊慌，他们派来宪兵镇压并逮捕了一些人。示威群众因此更加愤慨，一齐拥到伪“省长”的住宅，愤怒地要求伪“省长”答应“停止恐怖‘扫荡’；停止炮击村庄；保证让人民过安宁生活；让被迫当兵的丈夫和儿子回家；让人民自由探望被囚禁的人”，并且要求释放被捕的群众。
    在人民群众斗争的压力下，伪“省长”被迫接受了人民的抗议书，并答应将解决人民所提出的要求。据不完全统计，在过去的三个月中，槟椥省各地有十万以上的人参加了反美吴集团的斗争。
