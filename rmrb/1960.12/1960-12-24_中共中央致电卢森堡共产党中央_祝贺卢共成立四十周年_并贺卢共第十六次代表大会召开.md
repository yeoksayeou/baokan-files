Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Luxembourg to congratulate it on the 40th anniversary of its founding (January 2nd, 1961) and on the convening of its 16th Congress (December 24th, 1960). The full text of the congratulatory telegram is as follows:
To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Luxembourg, and to the 16th Congress of the Communist Party of Luxembourg, dear comrades:

    On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of Luxembourg and the convening of its 16th Congress, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, on behalf of all members of the Communist Party of China, extends warm fraternal congratulations to all comrades of the Communist Party of Luxembourg and to the Congress.

    The Communist Party of Luxembourg is the vanguard of the working class of Luxembourg. For forty years, it has consistently fought to safeguard the vital interests and democratic rights of the working class and working people of Luxembourg, to defend national independence, and to strive for socialism. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people have always been concerned about your struggle with fraternal feelings and are happy for your achievements.

    At present, in the excellent international situation where the world capitalist system is declining and decaying, the strength and influence of the socialist camp is increasing day by day, the liberation movement of oppressed nations is flourishing, and the forces of peace are increasingly surpassing the forces of war, we firmly believe that through your efforts, in Luxembourg, as in other regions, the struggle to maintain world peace and strive for a socialist future will surely achieve final victory.

    We wish the Congress complete success.

                        The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
                                                December 20, 1960
