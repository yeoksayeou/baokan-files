Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 4th. The Korean People's Army Ensemble, accompanied by Major General Wei Chuantong, representative of the Chinese Ministry of National Defense, left Shenyang by special train this morning and will return home via Andong.

Those who came to Shenyang Railway Station to see them off included Lieutenant General Zeng Siyu, Lieutenant General Zeng Shaoshan, and Lieutenant General Du Ping, leaders of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Shenyang Military Region; Che Xiangchen, Deputy Governor of Liaoning Province; Hu Yimin, Standing Committee Member and Secretary-General of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party; Tang Hongguang, Vice President of the Liaoning Branch of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association; Wu Tieming, Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party; and Song Guang, Deputy Mayor of Shenyang.

Jeong Bong-gyu, the Korean Consul General in Changchun, also came to the station to see them off.

At dawn today, more than three thousand well-wishers gathered in the Shenyang South Railway Station Square, which was fluttering with colorful flags. When the Korean People's Army Ensemble, led by Major General Zhang Ruihuan, arrived at the station, firecrackers and drums sounded in unison, and cheers resounded. A group of young female art workers presented flowers to the guests. With reluctance to part, people danced Korean dances and Chinese Yangko dances to the sound of friendship music. Guests and hosts held hands and stood shoulder to shoulder, stepping onto the platform amidst the colorful confetti. The guests hung Sino-Korean friendship commemorative badges on the chests of the well-wishers. When the guests boarded the train, colorful ribbons connected the hands of the Chinese and Korean people. As the train was about to depart, the sound of "Goodbye!" echoed on and off the train. The Chinese people asked the heroic envoys from the fraternal country to convey the warm greetings of the Chinese people and army to the Korean people and army.

The Korean People's Army Ensemble visited and performed in Beijing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, Shenyang and other places for more than forty days. They were warmly welcomed everywhere, further enhancing the fraternal and militant friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. (Attached picture)
