    Iron Bucket and Tea Mug
    These two rusty iron buckets and broken tea mug record an epic poem of arduous struggle...
    In the winter of 1943, the Japanese invaders mobilized all their forces stationed in Shandong and launched a frenzied "mopping-up" campaign. In order to contain the enemy and allow our main forces to transfer to the outer lines for combat, our army used a company of soldiers to defend the North and South Daigu Mountains, resisting enemies forty times our strength.
    North and South Daigu are strategically located, with many steep cliffs. Our soldiers, surrounded by the enemy on all sides, faced extremely difficult and arduous conditions. Persisting on Daigu Mountain was not for a day, but for fifteen days. It was not just the fatigue of battle, but mainly the lack of water; thirst threatened the heroes who were fighting fiercely all day long. They could only risk their lives in the dead of night, using straps to lower people from the cliffs to bring back a little water in this iron bucket. Each soldier could only be given half a mug of water from this small tea mug each day. Even this half a mug of water, the soldiers were reluctant to drink, passing it around, only moistening their lips, reluctant to swallow.
    After half a month of fierce fighting, more than a hundred enemies were killed or wounded. The Japanese invaders, under the pressure of our powerful main forces on the left, right, and outer lines, retreated in disarray. Before leaving Daigu Mountain, the heroes handed this iron bucket and tea mug to the local Party organization. This was a precious souvenir they left on Daigu Mountain.

    铁水桶和茶缸
    这两个锈铁桶和破茶缸，记载着一篇艰苦战斗的英雄诗篇……
    1943年的冬天，日寇调动了驻山东的全部兵力，发动了疯狂的“扫荡”战。为了牵制敌人、让我军主力转移到外线作战，我军用一个连的兵力坚守在南北岱固山上，抗击着四十倍于我的敌人。
    南北岱固，地势险要，陡崖很多，在受到敌人四面包围下的我军战士，环境极端困难和艰苦。坚持在岱固山上，不是一天，而是十五天，不仅是战斗的疲劳，而最主要的是没有水，干渴威胁着终日激战的英雄们。他们只有在深夜，冒着生命危险，把人从山崖上用绑带吊下去，就用这只铁桶带上一点水来。每天每个战士仅能用这个小茶缸分到半缸水，就是这半缸水，战士们也舍不得喝，让来让去，只沾沾唇边谁都舍不得咽下。
    经过半个月的激战，共杀伤敌人一百多名。日寇在我左右外线强大主力的压制下，狼狈溃退了。英雄们在离开岱固山前，把这一只铁桶和茶缸交给了当地党组织，这是他们在岱固山留下的珍贵纪念品。
