Xinhua News Agency, Differdange, 26th - TASS reported from Differdange today: The Luxembourg Communist Party held its Sixteenth Congress in Differdange, a major industrial city in Luxembourg, on the 24th and 25th.

Dominique Urbany, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Luxembourg Communist Party, delivered a general political report at the meeting, analyzing the current domestic and international situation of Luxembourg. He pointed out that the recent meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties in Moscow was of great significance for strengthening the unity of the workers' movement and for the struggle to safeguard peace and prevent a new war. Urbany emphasized that the unremitting struggle of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries to defend peace has played a great educational role for the working people, making it increasingly difficult for the ruling groups to use anti-communist scare tactics. He said that the Luxembourg government is blindly following the will of the major Western powers. However, the general trend of world development and the struggle waged by the Communists for the interests of the Luxembourg people have greatly changed the understanding of many Luxembourgers. On behalf of the Central Committee, Urbany called on the Luxembourg government to adopt a policy of neutrality. He pointed out that a policy of neutrality is in the national interest of Luxembourg and can spare the country unnecessary military spending.

Uscharding, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Luxembourg Communist Party, delivered a report on strengthening the Party's organizational work at the meeting.

Representatives of fraternal Communist and Workers' Parties from the Soviet Union and European countries also spoke at the meeting. They congratulated the Luxembourg Communist Party on its new achievements in the struggle to strengthen peace and for a better future for the working people of Luxembourg.

The congress unanimously adopted a resolution expressing the Luxembourg Communist Party's unanimous support for the historically significant document adopted by the Moscow meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries. The resolution stated that the Luxembourg Communist Party considers itself obligated to mobilize the Luxembourg working people to fight for peace, peaceful coexistence, universal disarmament, Luxembourg's withdrawal from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other aggressive blocs, and the restoration of a neutral and independent policy. The resolution said that the Luxembourg Communist Party believes that pursuing such a policy will guarantee a peaceful future for our country and will make a great contribution to the struggle for peace, progress throughout the world, and mutual understanding among peoples.

The congress unanimously elected Dominique Urbany to continue serving as the General Secretary of the Luxembourg Communist Party.

    卢森堡共产党召开代表大会
    通过决议支持莫斯科会议文件
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社迪弗当日讯：卢森堡共产党24日和25日在卢森堡的大工业城市迪弗当日举行了第十六次代表大会。
    卢森堡共产党中央委员会总书记多米尼克·欧班尼在会上作了总的政治报告，分析了当前卢森堡的国内外形势。他指出最近在莫斯科举行的各国共产党和工人党代表会议对加强工人运动的团结，对维护和平和防止新战争的斗争具有重大意义。欧班尼着重指出，苏联和其他社会主义国家保卫和平的不懈斗争对劳动人民起了很大的教育作用，使统治集团越来越难于使用反共的吓人把戏。他说，卢森堡政府一味秉承西方大国的意旨行事。但是，世界总的发展趋向和共产党员为卢森堡人民利益而进行的斗争已经大大改变了许多卢森堡人的认识。欧班尼以中央委员会的名义要求卢森堡政府采取中立政策。他指出中立政策符合卢森堡的民族利益，可以使国家免于不必要的军费负担。
    卢森堡共产党中央委员会书记乌撒尔丁格在会上作了在组织上加强党的工作的报告。
    苏联和欧洲国家的兄弟共产党和工人党代表也在会上讲了话。他们祝卢森堡共产党在争取加强和平和卢森堡劳动人民美好未来的斗争中取得新的成就。
    大会一致通过了一项决议，表示卢森堡共产党一致支持各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议所通过的有历史意义的文件。决议说，卢森堡共产党认为自己有义务动员卢森堡劳动人民进行争取和平、实现和平共处、普遍裁军、争取卢森堡退出北大西洋集团和其他侵略集团、恢复中立和独立政策的斗争。决议中说，卢森堡共产党相信，奉行这种政策将会保障我国和平的未来，将为和平、全世界的进步和各国人民之间相互了解的斗争作出巨大的贡献。
    大会最后一致选出多米尼克·欧班尼继续担任卢森堡共产党总书记。
