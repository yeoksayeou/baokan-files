    The No. 3 Machine Tool Plant in Shenyang has a famous "Treasure Trove." This was established by "Old Steward" Su Baoyuan, who collected waste materials bit by bit. Inside, there are metal materials, tools, equipment, rags, waste paper... truly a colorful assortment. Su Baoyuan used to be a service worker and is now the assistant to the factory director. He cherishes every plant and tree in the factory, day in and day out for ten years.

    Once, the factory was rushing to produce steam turbines for a power station, but the casting workshop ran out of screen mesh, and it was impossible to buy any in the city for a while. Everyone was worried. At a factory-wide production scheduling meeting, Lao Wei, the deputy director of the General Affairs Section, remembered the "Old Steward's" "Treasure Trove" and suggested checking there. He rushed to the "Treasure Trove" and saw: Ho, not only did they have it, but they had a lot of it!

    The reputation of the "Treasure Trove" has not only spread throughout the city but also far into the rural areas surrounding it. Not long ago, a diesel engine in a people's commune in Tieling County stopped running because the tungsten alloy bearing shell had burned out. What to do? The commune members couldn't think of a solution. Suddenly, a commune member suggested: Let's go to the No. 3 Machine Tool Plant in the city for help. We heard there's a "Treasure Trove" there. Soon, they arrived at the machine tool plant. "Old Steward" warmly welcomed them and took out five tungsten alloy bearing shells from the warehouse, letting them take them back happily.

    The palm-sized pieces of waste abrasive cloth used for wiping machines, the factory workers used to throw away countless numbers of them every year. "Old Steward" picked them up one by one, accumulating several sacks of them in a few days. When he processed this batch of abrasive cloth, he first soaked it in cold water, but it didn't work. He switched to hot water. After the glue that held the sand dissolved, all the sand came off. After a scrub, the cloths were all clean and white. This made "Old Steward" very happy. After that, every Saturday, he would wash the waste abrasive cloth he had collected during the week, clean it, and hand it over to the factory, increasing its income. (Attached picture)

### “老管家”的“万宝库”

    “老管家”的“万宝库”
    沈阳第三机床厂有个著名的
  “万宝库”。这是“老管家”苏宝元一点一滴地收集废物废料设立的，里面有金属材料、工具、设备、破布、碎纸……真是五光十色。苏宝元以前是个勤务工，现在是厂长助理。他爱护厂里一草一木，十年如一日。
    有一回，工厂赶制电站汽轮机，不料铸造车间没有了筛网，市上一时又买不到，大家正着急。在一次全厂的生产调度会上，总务科副科长老魏想起了“老管家”的“万宝库”，建议去查查。他赶到“万宝库”一看：嗬，不仅有，而且多得很哩！
    “万宝库”的名声，不仅流传在市内，还远播四郊农村。不久前，铁岭县一个人民公社有一台柴油机因钨金瓦烧坏停止转动了。怎么办呢？社员们想不出一点门路。忽然一个社员建议：咱们进城到第三机床厂去求援，听说那里有个“万宝库”。不久，他们就来到了机床厂。“老管家”热情地接待了他们，又从库里取出五块钨金瓦，让他们高高兴兴地带了回去。
    擦机器用的巴掌大的废砂布，厂里工人们每年不知要扔掉多少。“老管家”一块块地拣起来，几天工夫就积聚了几麻袋。他在处理这批砂布时，先拿凉水泡，不济事，改用热水泡，粘砂子的胶溶化后，砂子统统脱光了，再把砂布一搓洗，全是白净净的好布，这可把“老管家”乐坏了。以后，他每到星期六，就将一周来收集的废砂布洗刷干净，交给工厂增加了收入。（附图片）
