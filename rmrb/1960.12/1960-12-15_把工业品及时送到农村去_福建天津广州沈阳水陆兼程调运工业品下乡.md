Fujian, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Shenyang Transport Industrial Products to Rural Areas by Land and Water

(Reported by our newspaper) Commercial departments in Fujian Province are actively organizing the supply of industrial products to rural areas, giving priority to meeting the needs of the peak season market in the countryside. According to statistics from eleven department store wholesale stations in Fuzhou, Xiamen, Nanping, Zhangzhou, and other locations alone, industrial products worth more than 45 million yuan have been organized for distribution to rural areas in the past two months. These commodities include cotton cloth, rubber shoes, cotton sweaters and trousers, wool yarn, as well as daily-use industrial products such as thermos bottles, cups, buttons, and hairpins.

In order to prepare for the peak season market in the countryside after the autumn harvest, commercial departments throughout the province sent special personnel to various communes and production teams as early as the third quarter to investigate and understand the needs of the commune members and actively organize sources of goods. Therefore, the supply of industrial products to rural areas throughout the province this year started earlier than in previous years, and the quantity and variety of commodities transferred to rural areas have also increased significantly. In the process of organizing the distribution of daily-use industrial products to rural areas, commercial departments in various locations actively organized manpower to deliver the goods to the forefront of agriculture. The Longxi Special Zone commercial department organized a large number of peddlers to carry out delivery and sales activities. In just ten days, more than 3,600 peddlers delivered more than 400,000 yuan worth of goods to nearly 500 production teams. The Jinjiang Special Zone used forms such as commodity exchange meetings, commodity exhibitions, and rural night markets to release commodities that are suitable for rural sales in a timely manner. Jinjiang County also organized a production and living service network based on the supply and marketing cooperatives of production brigades and centered on the canteen service department, transferring more than 150 kinds of commodities that commune members like to the supply and marketing cooperatives and service departments, making it convenient for commune members to purchase them at any time.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin: Since the fourth quarter, Tianjin has been transporting hundreds of tons of daily-use industrial products to rural areas every day via land and water routes to meet rural needs. According to statistics from the city's five purchasing and supply stations for textiles, department stores, knitwear, and medicine, the total value of daily-use industrial products such as cotton cloth, batteries, matches, rubber shoes, thermos bottles,绒衣裤 (rong yi ku - fleece lined clothing) and medicines for treating colds and flu supplied to rural areas in the city in October and November has reached more than 180 million yuan.

In order to further improve the supply to the rural market after the autumn harvest, the Tianjin Municipal Commercial Department sent people to the countryside in the early third quarter to investigate and understand the changes in farmers' demand for daily-use industrial products, assist industrial departments in organizing production, and expand the source of goods. Among the commodities transported to various places, there are hundreds of new varieties, including newly added sturdy and durable coarse twill cloth, wear-resistant khaki cloth, high-top labor rubber shoes that use less glue and are light to wear, and novel绒衣 (rong yi - fleece lined clothing).

In order to deliver commodities to the countryside in a timely manner, the Tianjin Municipal Commercial Department, in addition to adopting the method of prioritizing the shipment and supply of commodities needed for agriculture, also worked closely with the transportation department to focus on transportation. The department store and knitwear purchasing and supply station reformed the allocation method, delivering the goods directly to the end, reducing the links in the circulation of goods, and shortening the time for goods to be transported in transit by about ten days compared with the past.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 14th: The Guangzhou Municipal Commercial Department is actively organizing the supply of industrial products to rural areas to meet the needs of farmers for industrial products after they sell their autumn harvest agricultural products.

Because of early preparation, many of the autumn and winter daily-use industrial products transferred to rural areas by the commercial department this year were one to two months earlier than last year, and the quantity and variety of commodities have also increased compared with last year. The cotton sweaters, cotton felt, toothpaste, gold pens, and bicycles transferred to rural areas in the city in August and September increased by 11% to seven times compared with the same period last year. Since the fourth quarter, various commercial units have continued to increase the supply of various winter industrial products to rural areas.

In order to quickly transfer various industrial products suitable for rural needs to the countryside, various commercial departments have taken the initiative to contact and cooperate with relevant transportation departments, and have been working hard to do a good job in the warehousing, loading, and shipping of commodities, and accelerating the speed of transportation.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 14th: The Shenyang Municipal Department Store Company has vigorously organized the transfer of daily-use industrial products to rural areas. By the end of November, nine major varieties, including cotton rubber shoes, leather hats, cups, and socks, had completed the annual supply plan ahead of schedule.

Among the commodities transferred to rural areas, a large number of new varieties of products needed to support farmers in developing winter sideline production such as hunting, fishing, and firewood cutting after the autumn harvest have been added this year. In order to increase the source of goods, the department store company has tried every means to solve the problems of fuel, raw materials, and equipment for the industrial departments, thereby increasing the source of goods. At the same time, the department store company has paid special attention to giving play to the enthusiasm of county-run industries. Now the company has helped nine counties expand the production of casual shoes, towels, thread blankets, socks, thread gloves, pillowcases, and other commodities, with output increasing by 20% to 80% compared with last year.

    把工业品及时送到农村去
    福建天津广州沈阳水陆兼程调运工业品下乡
    本报讯　福建省商业部门积极组织工业品下乡，优先供应农村旺季市场需要。仅据福州、厦门、南平、漳州等十一个百货批发站统计，近两个月来，组织下乡的工业品已达四千五百多万元。这些商品包括棉布、胶鞋、棉毛衫裤、毛线及热水瓶、口杯、钮扣、发卡等日用工业品，应有尽有。
    为了迎接秋后农村旺季市场，全省各地商业部门早在第三季度就派专人深入农村各公社和生产队调查了解社员需要，积极组织货源。所以今年全省工业品下乡时间比往年都要早，调往农村的商品数量和品种也有显著增加。在组织日用工业品下乡的过程中，各地商业部门积极组织力量把商品送到农业第一线。龙溪专区商业部门组织大批货郎担开展送售运动，仅十天就有三千六百多副货郎担把四十多万元的商品送到了近五百个生产队。晋江专区通过召开物资交流会、商品展览会和农村夜市等形式把适销农村的商品及时放下去。晋江县还组织了一个以生产大队供销部为基地、食堂服务部为中心的生产、生活服务网，把社员喜爱的大小一百五十多种商品调拨到供销部、服务部，便利社员随时购买。
    据新华社天津电　天津市从第四季度以来每天都有数以百吨计的日用工业品，从水陆两路运往各地农村，供应农村需要。据这个市的纺织品、百货、针棉织品、医药等五个采购供应站的统计：在10、11两个月里全市供应农村的棉布、电池、火柴、胶鞋、暖水瓶、绒衣裤和医治伤风感冒等冬令病的药品等日用工业品的总值，已达一亿八千多万元。
    天津市商业部门为了进一步作好秋收后农村市场的供应工作，早在第三季度初就分别派人下乡调查了解农民对日用工业品需求的变化，协助工业部门组织生产，扩大货源。在运往各地的商品中，有新增添的坚固耐穿的粗斜纹布、耐磨卡其布、用胶少穿着轻便的高筒劳动胶鞋，以及式样新颖的绒衣等数以百计的新品种。
    为了及时把商品下放到农村，天津市商业部门除了对农业需要的商品采取优先发运、优先供应的方法外，并与交通运输部门密切配合，狠抓调运工作。百货、针棉织品采购供应站改革调拨方法，将商品一放到底，减少商品流转环节，使商品在途运输时间一般比过去缩短十天左右。
    据新华社广州14日电　广州市商业部门积极组织工业品下乡，适应农民出售秋收农产品以后对工业品的需要。
    因为准备得早，今年商业部门调运到农村的秋冬日用工业品，很多都比去年提早一至二个月，而且商品数量和品种也比去年有所增加。全市8、9月份调往农村的棉毛衫裤、棉毡、牙膏、金笔和自行车等，分别比去年同期增加11％至七倍。第四季度以来，各商业单位调往农村的各种冬令工业品续有增加。
    为了迅速地把各种适合农村需要的工业品调往农村，各商业部门主动地同有关交通运输部门联系配合，抓紧做好商品出库、装车和发运工作，加速调运速度。
    据新华社沈阳14日电　沈阳市百货公司大力组织调运日用工业品下乡，到11月底，棉胶鞋、皮帽子、口杯、袜子等九个主要品种都提前完成了全年供应计划。
    在调往农村的商品中，今年增加了大批支援农民在秋后开展狩猎、捕鱼、砍柴等冬季副业生产需要的新品种产品。为了增加货源，百货公司千方百计为工业部门解决燃料、原料材料和设备等问题，从而增加了货源。同时，百货公司特别重视了发挥县办工业的积极性。现在这个公司已经帮助九个县扩大了便鞋、毛巾、线毯、袜子、线手套、枕套等商品的生产，产量比去年分别增长20％到80％。（附图片）
