    (Reported by this newspaper) The CCP Hubei Luotian County Committee, in implementing the "3-7 System" leadership method, conscientiously summarized its experiences and resolved the contradictions of inconsistent paces between upper and lower-level cadres and the failure to combine specific points with the overall situation, making this leadership system more perfect.

    Luotian County began implementing the "3-7 System" in July this year. Initially, some people reflected that "there are fewer meetings, making it difficult to combine specific points with the overall situation" and that "a management area has dozens of production teams, how can one understand the overall situation by squatting in one team?" In response to this situation, the county party committee promptly studied and summarized the problems that emerged in the implementation of the "3-7 System." After analysis and research, it was believed that the main reason was that some cadres did not understand the essence of the "3-7 System." In addition to repeatedly publicizing the important significance of implementing the "3-7 System" at all levels of cadre meetings, especially among leading cadres at all levels, the county party committee also promptly summarized the experiences of some communes in implementing the "3-7 System," going deep into one point, deep into the masses, and combining specific points with the overall situation, clearing ideological obstacles for some cadres and enabling the majority of cadres to master working methods.

    On the basis of unified thinking, the county party committee, in response to the phenomenon that the county party committee and the commune were not aligned, causing meetings at the top to disrupt the system at the bottom, and the contradiction between specific points and the overall situation, adopted the following measures: From the county party committee to the management area, alignment was established and time was fixed. Generally, the first four days of every ten days were spent participating in production labor and helping the team solve problems; the middle three days were spent half a day in labor and half a day in turning to the overall situation, so that specific points and the overall situation were combined; the last three days were spent studying, summarizing work, researching problems, and arranging the next stage of work. After this arrangement, cadres at all levels reflected: "There is a unified arrangement for squatting at a point and turning to the overall situation, and there are clear requirements for work and study, so the work will not be chaotic."

    After the contradictions of upper and lower alignment and the combination of specific points and the overall situation were resolved, the superiority of the "3-7 System" became more apparent. The number of large and small meetings in the county has been reduced by two-thirds compared with the past. According to a survey of 144 commune party committee members, after conscientiously implementing the "3-7 System," the average number of work points earned by each person per month increased from 77 to 112. In the past, the masses said that cadres had "three mores" (more meetings, more visits, more speeches), but now they say that cadres have "three goods" (good at participating in production labor, good at going deep into the team to help with work, and good at implementing policies and contacting the masses).

    认真总结经验　及时解决矛盾
    罗田县改进“三七制”领导方法
    本报讯　中共湖北罗田县委在实行“三七制”领导方法中，认真总结经验，解决了上下级干部之间步调不一致、点面不结合的矛盾，使这一领导制度更趋完善。
    罗田县今年7月开始实行“三七制”，开始有人反映“开会少了，点面难结合”，“一个管理区有几十个生产小队，蹲在一个小队，怎样了解全面情况”。针对这种情况，县委及时研究总结了执行“三七制”过程中出现的问题。经过分析研究，认为主要是有些干部不了解“三七制”的精神实质，县委除在各级干部会上，特别是在各级领导干部中反复宣传实行“三七制”的重要意义外，并及时总结了一些公社在执行“三七制”中，深入一点、深入群众，点面结合的经验，扫清了一部分干部的思想障碍，使多数干部掌握了工作方法。
    在统一思想的基础上，县委又针对由于县委与公社上下不对口，造成上面开会打乱下面制度的现象，以及点面结合的矛盾，又采取如下办法：从县委到管理区上下对口，固定时间，即每十天当中，一般是前四天参加生产劳动，帮助小队解决问题；中间三天半天劳动，半天转面，使点面结合；最后三天学习、总结工作、研究问题，布置下段工作。这样安排后，各级干部反映：“蹲点、转面有了统一安排，工作、学习有了明确要求，工作就不会打乱仗了。”
    上下对口、点面结合的矛盾解决后，“三七制”的优越性更加显示出来。县的大小会议较过去减少了三分之二，据在一百四十四个公社党委委员中调查，认真执行“三七制”后，每人每月由平均做七十七个工分上升到一百一十二个工分。以前群众说干部“三多”（会议多、参观多、讲话多），现在说干部“三好”（参加生产劳动好、深入小队帮助工作好，执行政策联系群众好）。
