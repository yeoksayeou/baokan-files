    Wholeheartedly Serving the Livelihood of Chongqing Steel Workers
    Dadukou Commune's Various Undertakings Develop Rapidly

    (Our report) Chongqing’s Dadukou People's Commune actively carries out work to serve the livelihood of the large factory's workers, which promotes the factory's production and accelerates the development of the commune's various undertakings.
    The Dadukou People's Commune is mainly composed of the family members of Chongqing Steel Company's workers. To clarify the commune's production direction, the commune specifically organized a work team to conduct concrete investigations and research in the factory, and discovered that Chongqing Steel urgently needed to strengthen the service work for the workers' livelihood. Although Chongqing Steel and Dadukou People's Commune had continuously strengthened this work in the past, it had not been thoroughly resolved. For example, because the commune's sewing, shoemaking, and repair industries were not developed enough, some workers had to take a bus to Chongqing city to have clothes and shoes made, which was extremely inconvenient. Based on this situation, the commune's Party committee decided to take serving the livelihood of Chongqing Steel's workers as the commune's central task, and strengthened the welfare department's cadre force. At the same time, they also extensively and deeply conducted ideological education among the commune members on "wholeheartedly serving the livelihood of Chongqing Steel workers," so that the commune members firmly established the idea that "doing a good job in serving the livelihood of workers is directly serving the steel industry." Based on this, the commune focused on strengthening the service to the workers' livelihood in the following three aspects.
    First, all of the commune's original twenty-three commune-run factories were gradually adopted methods such as shifting, expanding, and increasing, to turn their main energy to the production and processing of workers' daily necessities. For example, the workers of the past eight commune-run factories such as screw manufacturing, water glass, refractory materials, and asbestos have turned to the production of daily necessities, and vigorously replenished and expanded the sewing, children's shoes, slippers, and repair industries that workers urgently need. A batch of industries needed for workers' lives were also newly built, such as clothing knitting, small hardware, and vegetable and bean processing, and brewing production. After this adjustment, the commune members engaged in the production and processing of daily necessities for Chongqing Steel workers increased from the original four hundred to more than one thousand two hundred, and the main varieties of daily necessities produced and processed increased from the original nine to thirty-four. In October alone, the main products reached more than 158,000 pieces, an increase of more than six times compared with July before the rectification. It greatly solved the needs of workers' daily necessities. The commune can also process a large number of vegetables, beans and other non-staple foods every day, and only tofu, dried tofu, and bean sprouts reach six to seven thousand catties. In addition, the commune also transferred a large number of laborers to other life-oriented production work. For example, in the past, there was no fixed transportation force responsible for transporting daily necessities in this area, which often affected the timely supply of workers' daily necessities. Now the commune has sent more than 800 commune members to specialize in transporting grain, non-staple food, department stores and other daily necessities. Recently, the commune organized more than 200 commune members to form a coal cinder production team, which can pick more than 2 million catties of coal cinder every month from the coal residue after Chongqing Steel's steelmaking and ironmaking, which can solve the living coal for more than 40,000 people.
    Second, reasonably adjust and vigorously strengthen the worker's livelihood service network centered on the canteen, and universally build or expand nurseries, vegetable gardens, hot water stations, laundry groups, sewing and mending groups, and consignment shops and other livelihood service organizations. In the past, Chongqing Steel's workers ate at the workshop canteen, but the workshop canteen was far away from the workers' family area, and the workers had to go to the workshop to eat after get off work and holidays, which was very inconvenient. The Dadukou Commune actively tried to help the workers solve this difficulty. Nine canteens were added and expanded so that workers could eat at the workshop canteen or the commune canteen according to the principle of voluntariness, which was very convenient for workers when they went to work and returned home. The number of people eating at the canteen increased by more than 8,000. The number of children of Chongqing Steel workers is very large, and the company's nursery cannot meet the requirements. The Dadukou Commune strengthened the nursery business according to the workers' requirements, established twenty-two nurseries, and widely organized temporary nurseries. It has now helped the workers solve the problems of nearly 2,000 children. The commune also transferred more than 400 commune members to establish 103 laundry groups and sewing and mending groups, and established two livelihood service streets in areas where workers live in concentrated areas. The main livelihood service items increased from the past 15 to 51, which greatly facilitated the workers' eating, living, using, rest, and recreation.
    The Dadukou People's Commune also established family mutual aid groups among the workers' families, based on residential groups. Each group selected two to three enthusiastic service workers, who were trusted by the masses but could not participate in production due to housework, as family service workers. The Xinshancun branch of this commune established ninety-eight family service workers, who contracted the housework of more than 200 workers, and also helped more than 1,000 workers with some sporadic housework, which made the workers who had no one to take care of their families feel extremely convenient.
    After the Dadukou People's Commune actively served the workers' livelihood, it received enthusiastic support from the Chongqing Steel Party Committee and the broad masses of workers. The commune's labor potential was further brought into play, and the development of the commune's various undertakings was greatly accelerated.

    一心一意为重钢职工生活服务
    大渡口公社各项事业迅速发展
    本报讯　重庆大渡口人民公社，积极开展为大厂职工生活服务的工作，既促进了大厂的生产，又加速了公社各项事业的发展。
    大渡口人民公社是以重庆钢铁公司的职工家属为主要成员组成的。为明确公社的生产方向，公社专门组织工作组深入工厂进行具体的调查研究，发现重钢迫切需要加强职工生活的服务工作。过去重钢和大渡口人民公社虽然不断加强这方面的工作，但一直没有彻底解决。例如由于公社的缝纫、做鞋修补等行业发展不够，有的职工要做一套衣服、一双鞋子也要乘车到重庆市区加工，感到极不方便。根据这一情况，公社党委决定把为重钢职工生活服务作为公社的中心任务，并增强了福利部门的干部力量。同时，还在社员中广泛深入地进行
  “一心一意为重钢职工生活服务”的思想教育，使社员牢固地树立了“搞好职工生活服务工作就是直接为钢铁服务”的思想。在这个基础上，这个公社着重从以下三个方面加强为重钢职工生活服务。
    首先，将全社原有的二十三个社办工厂都逐步采取转向、扩大、增加等办法，把主要精力转向为职工生活资料的生产和加工。例如，过去的螺丝制造、水玻璃、耐火材料、石棉等八个社办工厂的职工都转向为生活资料生产、大力充实和扩大职工生活极需的缝纫、童鞋、便鞋、修补等行业。又新建了一批职工生活需要的行业，如衣物针织、小五金以及蔬菜豆类加工、酿造等生产。经过这样调整以后，全社为重钢职工生活资料生产和加工的社员已由原来的四百多人增加为一千二百多人，生产和加工的生活资料的主要品种由原有的九种增加为三十四种。仅10月份的主要产品就达到十五万八千多件，比整顿前的7月份增加六倍以上。大大解决了职工生活用品的需要。公社每天还可以加工大批蔬菜豆类等副食品，仅豆腐、豆干、豆芽就有六、七千斤。此外，公社还将大批劳动力转为作其他生活性的生产工作。例如，过去这个地区没有固定负责运输生活资料的运输力量，经常影响职工生活资料的及时供应。现在公社派了八百多社员专门运输粮食、副食品、百货等生活资料。最近公社组织了二百多社员组成炭花生产组，每月就可以在重钢的炼钢炼铁用后的炭渣里拣炭花二百多万斤，可以解决四万多人的生活用煤。
    其次，合理调整和大力加强以食堂为中心的职工生活服务网，普遍新建或扩建了托儿站、菜园、开水站、洗衣组、缝补组，以及代销店等等生活服务组织。过去重钢的职工在车间食堂搭伙，车间食堂离职工家属区很远，职工下班和假期回家后又要到车间吃饭，很不方便。大渡口公社便积极设法帮助职工解决这个困难。增加和扩大九个食堂，使职工根据自愿的原则，既可以在车间食堂搭伙又可以在公社食堂搭伙，职工在上班和回家时都很方便了。全社搭伙人员增加了八千多人。重钢职工小孩数量很大，公司托儿所远不能满足要求，大渡口公社根据职工要求又加强了托儿所事业，建立了二十二个托儿所，并广泛组织临时托儿站，现已帮助职工解决了将近二千个儿童的问题。公社还抽调了四百多个社员建立了一百零三个洗衣组、缝补组，在职工居住集中的地区建立了两条生活服务街，主要的生活服务项目由过去的十五项增加为五十一项，使职工的吃、住、用和休息，文娱都大大方便了。
    大渡口人民公社还在职工家属中，采取以居民小组为基础建立了家庭互助组，每个组选择二至三个热心服务工作、群众信任但又因家务拖累不能参加生产的家庭妇女作家庭服务员。这个公社的新山村分社建立了九十八个家庭服务员，包干了二百多个职工的家务外，还帮助一千多户职工做一些零星家务工作，使家中无人照料的职工感到了极大的方便。
    大渡口人民公社积极为职工生活服务以后，受到了重钢党委和广大职工的热烈支持，公社的劳动潜力也进一步发挥了作用，并大大加速了公社各项事业的发展。
