This Winter We Must Vigorously Grasp Fertilizer
    ——Several Problems in the Fertilizer Accumulation and Production Movement Led by the Leadership of Each Production Team in the Xiesheng Brigade
    Li Changchun
    Fertilizer is one of the important contents of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. "A phoenix doesn't land on barren land, high yields come from fertile fields," and "Crops are flowers, all relying on fertilizer as the foundation." These proverbs profoundly express the significant role of fertilizer in increasing yield per unit area.
    In early November, the Party General Branch of the Xiesheng Brigade in Maqiu People's Commune, Nanchang County, Jiangxi, took advantage of the victorious momentum of the autumn harvest and winter planting, and called on all cadres in the brigade to put forth the energy to run agriculture and grain production in a big way, and to produce fertilizer in a big way this winter. Now, a large-scale winter fertilizer accumulation and production movement has been launched.
    How much fertilizer is needed?
    As the saying goes: "Success or failure depends on water, high or low yield depends on fertilizer." Water used to be a serious problem in the area where the Xiesheng Brigade is located. Under the leadership of the Party, the diligent and brave people used their own hands to build the Ganfu Plain Comprehensive Development Project. The third branch of the fourth main canal reached here, realizing flow irrigation, so that "highlands are not droughty, and lowlands are not waterlogged." Therefore, striving for increased agricultural production next year and solving the problem of "high or low yield depends on fertilizer" has been placed on an important agenda.
    How much fertilizer should be produced this winter? The situation here is as follows:
    1.  The red flower grass (green manure) in the Xiesheng Brigade suffered a hailstorm in the first half of this year. There was a severe shortage of red flower seeds during the autumn sowing. Only more than 2,200 mu of red flowers were sown throughout the brigade, which was 2,200 mu less than last year. Although the red flower grass fields have decreased, the winter crop planting area has increased by more than 2,000 mu compared to last year, requiring an additional application of more than 200,000 dan of fertilizer. This has led to the phenomenon of "this winter occupying the fertilizer for next year's early rice crops, and the fertilizer reserves this winter being less than 80% of the same period last year." On the other hand, with the reduction of red flower fields, the area for applying base fertilizer next year will expand, and the task of accumulating fertilizer this winter will greatly increase. According to the requirements for fertilizer application per mu of early rice in the Xiesheng Brigade next year, one million more dan of fertilizer must be accumulated this winter than last winter.
    2.  With the development of cattle farming, the widespread adoption of new agricultural tools, especially the transformation of drainage and irrigation in the entire brigade from waterwheels to gravity irrigation, and the establishment of public canteens, kindergartens, nurseries, and other collective welfare undertakings, a large number of laborers have been saved, creating good conditions for appropriate deep plowing, rational close planting, and soil improvement. However, with the reform of cultivation systems and techniques, the quantity and quality of fertilizer application must be greater and better than in previous years. The 7,000 mu of early rice in the entire brigade require 2.8 million dan of fertilizer, an increase of nearly three times the amount of fertilizer applied per mu in 1960.
    3.  According to the principle of combining multiple planting for more yield and high yield for more yield, each production team initially plans to use "ten sides" vacant land, idle land, and wasteland to plant more than 300 mu next year, which will require an additional 120,000 dan of fertilizer.
    4.  With the great development of pig raising, the amount of green and coarse feed has greatly increased. Next year, the entire brigade needs to use water surfaces to propagate water hyacinths and water lilies and other feed on 100 mu. Calculating 10 dan of fertilizer per mu, this will require an additional 1,000 dan of fertilizer.
    5.  Next year, we will continue to mobilize commune members to use field edges, corners, and the areas in front of and behind villages to plant pig feed, miscellaneous grains, and other crops. The entire brigade will increase the planting area by 340 mu, requiring approximately 10,000 dan of fertilizer, calculated at 30 dan of fertilizer per mu.
    The above series of new circumstances indicates that the entire brigade will need 3.3 million dan of fertilizer in the first half of next year, an increase of more than twice the amount of fertilizer used in the same period this year. At present, the entire brigade not only has no reserves of fertilizer needed for next year, but also the existing fertilizer cannot meet the needs of winter crops this winter.
    After presenting the facts and calculating the details, the understanding of the cadres and the masses has been improved. Everyone unanimously demands that fertilizer be produced in a big way this winter and early.
    Seize Favorable Opportunities and Start Early
    There are many favorable conditions for producing fertilizer in a big way in winter: 1. Winter labor is relatively abundant; 2. The time for accumulating and producing fertilizer in winter is long, and weeds, fallen leaves, and straw that are difficult to rot and decompose can be fermented in cellars early to improve fertilizer efficiency; 3. Winter fertilizer sources are wide, and the efficiency of accumulating and producing fertilizer is high; 4. There are more sunny days and fewer rainy days in winter here, and the water in lakes and ponds is low, making it easy to pump dry, which is convenient for loading, unloading, and transporting fertile mud, saving labor.
    These indicate that time is equally valuable for fertilizer accumulation work. To produce fertilizer in a big way, we must start as early as possible.
    Fully Mobilize the Masses
    Producing fertilizer in a big way is a mass movement. In order to mobilize the production enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses, we must repeatedly publicize and implement the Party's policies, so that the masses can master the Party's policies and turn them into material forces.
    Currently, to mobilize the broad masses of commune members to participate in the fertilizer accumulation movement, we must seriously and conscientiously implement the policies of work point evaluation, reasonable remuneration, and equal pay for equal work while strengthening political and ideological work. In this autumn and winter fertilizer accumulation, the No. 1, No. 2, and No. 5 production teams fully implement the reward system that combines "graded quota responsibility system and quality-based pricing and cash-out system" for both large-scale fertilizer and scattered sporadic fertilizer, whether it is labor going out to cut grass or the elderly and children sweeping garbage and picking up wild manure at home. Specifically, for large-scale fertilizers such as cutting lake grass, picking pond mud, and shoveling sod, the task is assigned to the production team, or a professional team is organized. According to the size of the fertilizer effect, the difficulty of fertilizer accumulation, the size of labor intensity, and the distance of the journey, reasonable grading and fixed fertilizer are carried out, and the "five fixed" (fixed task, fixed remuneration, fixed time, fixed quality, fixed reward) are fully implemented. For personnel raising pigs, cattle, and ducks, adopt the method of "contracting fertilizer based on the number of heads" for different livestock, set a deadline for submitting tasks, and implement a reward and punishment system. For sporadic and scattered fertilizer, put forward requirements, price according to quality, and purchase in cash.
    According to the experience of these three teams, the benefits of fully promoting the "graded quota responsibility system and quality-based pricing and cash-out system" are: First, it can achieve "six combinations": year-round fertilizer accumulation and shock fertilizer accumulation, collective fertilizer accumulation and private fertilizer accumulation, large-scale fertilizer and sporadic fertilizer, domestic fertilizer and wild fertilizer, environmental sanitation and fertilizer accumulation, and breeding and fertilizer accumulation, fully tapping and utilizing fertilizer sources; Second, all positive factors are mobilized, making fertilizer accumulation work a mass movement; Third, more people produce "Han Xin," more inventions and creations, more advanced experience, and more, faster, better, and more economical fertilizer accumulation.
    Promote Advanced Experience
    In the movement to produce fertilizer in a big way, frequently paying attention to summarizing, improving, and promoting advanced experience is an important link in promoting more, faster, better, and more economical fertilizer accumulation. At the beginning of this autumn fertilizer accumulation movement, every fertilizer production cellar in the Second Production Team was "clear soup under the sod." What should be done? Team leader Li Run'gou consulted with production team cadres Fan Tuo'di and Fan Tao'yuan, and old farmers Hu Jianchang and Zhang Niu'zai, inquired about the experience and methods of making cellars, and excavated the method of composting in integrated fertilizer cellars in the fields that had been used for many years. Once this effective experience was promoted, it immediately showed its effect: First, the method is simple, everyone can do it, no cost is required, and it conforms to the spirit of increasing production and saving; Second, materials are convenient and abundant. In addition to sod, lake grass, and straw, tree leaves, melon rinds, fruit peels, sugarcane dregs and leaves, bean roots and shells, withered sweet potato vines, lime, human manure, pig and cattle manure, ditch sludge, and garbage can all be used in cellars; Third, the fertilizer effect is high and the quality is good. According to tests, each dan of fertilizer from a comprehensive fertilizer production cellar can抵上 one dan of manure fertilizer; Fourth, materials are obtained locally, manufactured locally, and applied locally, greatly saving labor for transportation. Especially for remote fields, the situation of less fertilizer due to the difficulty of transporting fertilizer over long distances can be changed; Fifth, sod, lake grass, straw, pig and cattle manure, etc. are all organic fertilizers. Continuous application makes the soil loose; Sixth, shoveling the light field embankments in winter and putting them into cellars can eliminate overwintering rice borers; Seventh, sending pig and cattle manure, garbage, etc. into comprehensive fertilizer production cellars is conducive to rural hygiene; Eighth, digging cellars to produce fertilizer can preserve the fertilizer effect.
    The experience gained by the Second Production Team in promoting integrated fertilizer cellars in the fields points out an undeniable truth: if advanced experience is treated enthusiastically and actively, advanced experience will be well used in production. (Attached picture)

    今年冬季必须狠抓肥料
    ——协成大队各生产队领导积肥造肥运动中的几个问题
    李长春
    肥料，是农业“八字宪法”重要内容之一。“凤凰不落无宝地，高产出在肥田里”、“庄稼是枝花，全靠肥当家”，这些谚语深刻地表达了肥料对提高单位面积产量的重大作用。
    11月上旬，江西南昌县麻丘人民公社协成大队党总支，乘秋收冬种全胜之风，号召全队干部拿出大办农业、大办粮食的劲头，冬季大办肥料。现在，大规模的冬季积肥造肥运动已经展开。
    需要多少肥料？
    常言说：“有收无收在于水，收多收少在于肥。”水，曾经是协成大队所在地区的一个严重问题。在党的领导下，勤劳勇敢的人民用自己的双手，修起了赣抚平原综合开发工程，四干渠三分渠通到了这里，使这里实现了流灌化，从此“高地不旱，低地不涝”了。因此，要争取明年农业增产，解决“收多收少在于肥”的问题，就提到重要的议事日程上来了。
    今冬要办多少肥料呢？这里的情况是这样：
    一、协成大队今年上半年红花草（绿肥）遭到雹灾，秋种时红花种子奇缺，全大队只播种红花二千二百多亩，比去年少二千二百亩。红花草田减少了，但冬作物播种面积比去年增加二千多亩，需增施肥二十余万担，这就发生了
  “今冬占用了明年早稻作物的肥料，今冬肥料储备少于去年同期的80％”的现象；另一方面，随着红花田的减少，明年施基肥面积扩大，今冬积肥任务随之大增。根据协成大队明年每亩早稻施肥量的要求，今冬要比去冬多积一百万担肥料。
    二、随着耕牛的发展，新式农具的广泛采用，特别是全大队的排灌已由车水变为自流灌溉，办起了公共食堂、幼儿园、托儿所等集体福利事业，节省出了大批劳动力，给适当深耕、合理密植、改良土壤等耕作技术创造了良好的条件。但随着耕作制度和技术的改革，施肥数量与质量都比往年要多要好。全大队七千亩早稻需肥二百八十万担，比1960年每亩施肥量增加近三倍。
    三、根据多种多收和高产多收相结合的方针，各生产队初步计划明年利用“十边”空地、闲土和荒地种植三百亩以上，这又需要肥料十二万担。
    四、随着养猪事业大发展，青粗饲料大量增加，全大队明年需要利用水面繁殖水浮莲、水葫芦等饲料一百亩，每亩以施肥十担计算，就需增加肥料一千担。
    五、明年继续发动社员利用田边地角、村前屋后种植猪饲料、杂粮等作物，全大队将增加三百四十亩种植面积，以每亩施肥三十担计算，需用肥一万担左右。
    上述一系列新情况表明，全大队明年上半年需肥三百三十万担，比今年同期用肥量增加二倍多。目前，全大队不仅没有储备明年需要的肥料，而且现有肥料尚不能满足今冬作物的需要。
    经过摆事实，算细账，干部和群众的认识提高了，大家一致的要求是：今冬必须大办肥料，早办肥料。
    抓紧有利时机早动手
    冬季大办肥料，有很多有利条件：一、冬季劳力较为充裕；二、冬季积肥造肥时间久，那些难于腐烂、分解的杂草、落叶、秸秆能早下窖沤制，提高肥效；三、冬季肥源广，积肥造肥工效高；四、这里历年冬天晴日多、雨日少，湖水、塘水少，容易车干，便于肥泥的装卸运输，省劳力。
    这些说明，时间对积肥工作同样是十分宝贵的。大办肥料，必须及早动手。
    充分发动群众
    大办肥料，是一个群众性的运动。为了调动广大群众的生产积极性与创造性，必须反复地宣传、贯彻执行党的方针政策，让群众掌握党的政策，变成物质力量。
    当前发动广大社员投入积肥运动，一定要在加强政治思想工作的同时，严肃地、认真地执行评工记分、合理计酬、同工同酬的政策。今年秋冬积肥中，一、二、五三个生产队，无论大宗肥料或分散的零星肥料，劳力出外打草或老人、小孩在家扫垃圾、拾野粪，全面实行“分等定额责任制和按质论价兑现制”相结合的奖励制度。具体来说，对打湖草、挑塘泥、铲草皮等大宗肥料，实行任务分到生产组，或者组织专业组，根据肥料的肥效大小、积肥的难易、劳动强度大小与路途的远近，进行合理分等定肥，全面实行“五定”（定任务、定报酬、定时间、定质量、定奖励）。饲养猪、牛、鸭的人员，根据不同的牲畜，采取“按头数定工包肥料”的办法，限期交任务，实行奖罚制度。对于零星分散的肥料，提出要求，按质论价，现金收购。
    根据这三个队的经验，全面推行“分等定额责任制和按质论价兑现制”办法的好处是：第一，可以做到常年积肥与突击性积肥、集体积肥与私人积肥、大宗肥料与零星肥料、家肥与野肥、环境卫生与积肥造肥、饲养与积肥“六结合”，充分挖掘与利用了肥源；第二，调动了一切积极因素，使积肥工作形成了群众运动；第三，人多出“韩信”，发明创造多，先进经验多，积肥造肥多、快、好、省。
    推广先进经验
    在大办肥料的运动中，经常地注意总结、提高、推广先进经验，是推动积肥造肥多、快、好、省的重要一环。今年秋季积肥运动开始时，第二生产队每一个造肥窖都是“清汤下草皮”，怎么办呢？大队长李润苟便请教了生产队干部樊佗弟、樊桃元和老农胡建昌、张牛仔，询问作窖的经验与方法，挖掘出多年来搞田头综合肥窖沤肥的办法。这项行之有效的经验一经推广，立刻显示出它的作用：第一，作法简单，人人可搞，不要什么成本，符合增产节约的精神；第二，取材方便，用材丰富。草皮、湖草、秸稿等之外，树叶、瓜皮、果壳、甘蔗渣与叶、豆根豆壳、枯薯藤和石灰、人粪尿、猪牛屎、阴沟污泥、垃圾等，都可以下窖利用；第三，肥效高，质量好，据试验，每担综合造肥窖的肥料可抵上一担粪肥；第四，就地取材，就地制造，就地施用，大大节省搬运的劳力。特别是边远田，可以改变过去因路远送肥料难而少肥的情况；第五，草皮、湖草、秸稿、猪牛粪等都是有机质肥料，连年施用，土壤疏松；第六，冬天铲光田塍下窖，可以消灭过冬螟虫；第七，猪牛粪、垃圾等送进综合造肥窖，有利于农村卫生；第八，挖窖造肥，可以保存肥效。
    第二生产队推广田头综合肥窖所取得的经验，给人们指出了一个不可辩驳的真理：热情地、积极地对待先进经验，先进经验才会很好地用于生产。（附图片）
