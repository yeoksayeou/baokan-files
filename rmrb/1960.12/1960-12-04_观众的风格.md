    The level of a person's style can be shown at any time and any place in his words and deeds, even watching ball games is no exception.
    Discipline, order, enthusiasm, humility, and fairness are the qualities that a good spectator should possess. When we watch ball games, it is not only for entertainment, to satisfy our interests and curiosity, to see who wins and who loses, and who wins the championship. In the game, we can also learn many other things.
    Superb performances often make us excited, applaud, and cheer; the unity and friendship of the players on both sides, their spirit of learning from each other with humility, and their good sportsmanship are even more touching. "Opponents on the field," each side displays their full skills in the battle, not yielding to each other; "friends off the field," after the game, regardless of who wins or loses, they shake hands and talk happily, full of enthusiasm, expressing admiration for each other. This emotion often warmly infects the audience, making the inside and outside of the field a surge of warmth. ... This kind of scene can often be seen especially in some friendly matches with foreign teams, which moves us and also gives us a vivid lesson in internationalism.
    Our spectators are enthusiastic, fair, and also humble. They cheer and applaud the winning team's wonderful performances, and also applaud the losing team's superb skills. Our spectators are also disciplined and orderly. For a ball game to proceed smoothly from beginning to end, it not only depends on the players of both sides, with strong fighting spirit and good sportsmanship, but also on the spectators' discipline, order, enthusiastic cooperation and support. And our spectators generally do this.
    However, we sometimes see that a few spectators still lack the above-mentioned noble style. They are preoccupied with the gains and losses and victories and defeats of every ball and every point, emphasizing winning or losing over friendship. They don't know that in ball games, we certainly hope that one side's athletes will win, but more importantly, it is to exchange experience, deepen understanding, and enhance friendship through the game. In the course of the game, these people often shout loudly in the stands because of individual mistakes and misjudgments by the referees, or fouls and inappropriate actions by individual athletes, which affect the progress of the game and cause bad consequences. This style is contrary to the inherent enthusiasm, humility, and politeness of the Chinese people. It should be resolutely eliminated.
    Everything should be politically oriented, and watching ball games is no exception. Don't think that watching ball games is a trivial matter, and it doesn't matter if you are careless. On the contrary, small things often contain big things. If the friendship between the two sides is affected by the unfriendly behavior of a few spectators, isn't that a big deal?

    观众的风格
    凌佩
    一个人风格的高低，在他的一言一行中，随时随地都可以表现出来，就是看球类比赛也不例外。
    守纪律，守秩序，热情、谦逊，公正，这是一个好的观众所应具备的风格。我们看球类比赛，不单是为了娱乐，为了满足自己的兴趣和好奇心，看谁输谁赢，谁得了冠军，在比赛中，我们还可以学到其他许多东西。
    精湛的表演常使我们兴奋，鼓掌，喝采；交战双方的队员们的那种团结友爱，彼此虚心学习的精神，以及良好的体育道德作风，更使我们感动。“场上是对手”，交战中各自施展出全副本领，互不相让；“场下是朋友”，比赛完毕，不管谁胜谁负，握手言欢，热情洋溢，互道仰慕之忱。这种情绪时常热烈地感染了观众，使场内场外一片暖流激荡。……这种情景尤其是在一些与外国球队的友谊比赛中可以经常见到，使我们感动，也使我们受到一次生动的国际主义教育。
    我们的观众是热情的，公正的，也是谦逊的。他们为胜队的精采表演欢呼鼓掌，也为负队的一些精湛技艺喝采连声。我们的观众也是守纪律，守秩序的。一场球赛要顺利进行，善始善终，不单靠比赛双方的队员，有顽强的斗志和良好的体育道德作风，也要靠观众守纪律，守秩序，热情地配合和支持。而我们的观众一般是做到了这点的。
    但是，我们有时也看到有少数观众，还缺少以上所说的这种高尚的风格，他们斤斤计较一球一分的得失和胜败，以比赛胜负为重，不以友谊为重。他们不知道在球类比赛中，我们固然希望一方的运动员获胜，但更重要的是为了通过比赛，交流经验，加深了解，增进友谊。在比赛过程中，这些人往往因为裁判员的个别失误和错判，或个别运动员的犯规和不当的动作，而在看台上高声喧嚷，以致影响球赛的进行，造成不好的后果。这种风格是和我国人民所固有的那种热情，谦逊，有礼貌的优秀作风背道而驰的。应当坚决肃清。
    一切都应当政治挂帅，看球类比赛也不例外。不要以为看球赛是件小事情，马虎一点没有什么，恰恰相反，小事情中往往包含着大事情。如果因为少数观众的不友好行为而影响比赛双方的友谊，那还不是大事情么？
