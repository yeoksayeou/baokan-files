According to Zhejiang Daily, regarding agricultural production, how to achieve both positive leadership and allow the masses to fully be masters of their own affairs; how to adhere to the Party's policies, act according to the national plan, and also be realistic and adapt to local conditions. The Caijia Production Team of Qinghu Commune, Jiangshan County, Zhejiang Province, provides a very good example.

Absorb Experiences and Lessons, Improve Ideological Understanding

When the Caijia Production Team's Party branch was fully mobilizing the masses to discuss and formulate the 1961 production plan, it first launched a discussion among the cadres on "How can we make the plan take root and blossom among the masses and truly play a guiding and promoting role in production?" During the discussion, everyone recalled the experience of leading production in recent years and summarized the experiences and lessons learned from the formulation of plans by the Fuqiaotou and Xintangdi sub-teams. Last year, when the Fuqiaotou sub-team was formulating the 1960 production plan, the cadres first consulted with experienced farmers, classified the land according to soil quality, water conservancy, and other conditions, and proposed arrangements for crop area and variety according to local conditions, and then mobilized the members to fully discuss and implement the plan to the plot. The members truly regarded the plan as their own business and tried their best to achieve it. As a result, this year the sub-team's early and mid-season rice and after-ripening crops exceeded the contracted production targets and received overproduction rewards. The Xintangdi sub-team did not fully discuss the production plan with the masses, and the members did not implement the plan seriously enough. As a result, they did not complete the contracted production targets this year. Through discussion, everyone realized that to make a good plan, it is necessary to act in accordance with the Party's policies and the national plan; at the same time, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses, let the masses be masters of their own affairs, be realistic, and adapt to local conditions.

Explain Principles and Tasks, Analyze Favorable Conditions

The Party branch especially carried out education among the members on vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, put forward the requirement that next year's agricultural production should strive to be better than any previous year, and repeatedly explained that agricultural production must adhere to the principles of taking grain as the key link, comprehensive development, and multiple high-yield and high-harvest. In the discussion, the members carefully analyzed the excellent situation that has emerged after the full implementation of the policies and the favorable conditions for striving for a bumper agricultural harvest next year, which are: First, the members have grasped the Party's policies, and their enthusiasm for production is getting higher and higher; second, after three consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward, rich experience in increasing production has been accumulated; third, the labor force invested in the front line of agricultural production has greatly increased; fourth, this year's spring planting area is large, planted in a timely manner, and growing well; fifth, the cadres' work style has improved, and they insist on implementing the "four togethers." After analysis and discussion, the members unanimously realized that as long as these favorable conditions are fully utilized and greater efforts are made, next year's agricultural production will definitely be better than any previous year.

Summarize High-Yield Experiences, Find Key to Increase Production

After fully carrying out ideological mobilization, the Party branch further mobilized the members to show output, compare highs and lows, summarize high-yield experiences, and find the key to increase production. The members displayed the grain output of each sub-team over the years. After comparison, the output in 1958 was the highest in terms of years; in terms of production sub-teams, the Satellite sub-team had the largest increase in output. Everyone summarized the experience of 1958 and the experience of the Satellite sub-team, mainly in three aspects: First, conscientiously implement the policy of multiple high-yield and high-harvest, increase the multiple cropping index, and grow multiple high-yield crops. The Satellite sub-team's annual grain multiple cropping index reached 256%, which was 67% higher than the average multiple cropping index of the entire production team. Of the 64 mu of land in the entire sub-team, 53 mu were planted with double-season late rice or high-yield crops such as corn and sweet potatoes. Second, implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture according to local conditions, achieve rational close planting, apply sufficient base fertilizer, and manage to high standards. In 1958, the entire production team's rice generally reached a close planting density of 25,000 to 30,000 plants per mu, and all early rice was planted before "Lixia" (Beginning of Summer), with sufficient base fertilizer applied to each mu. The Satellite sub-team also built three automatic ash kilns to burn ash and accumulate fertilizer all year round, and the base fertilizer for early rice was even more sufficient. In terms of management, the entire production team generally carried out three or four times of weeding and fertilization for early and mid-season rice. Third, crop varieties were well matched. The Satellite sub-team's wheat was all "Dwarf Grain Many," the barley was all "Lixia Yellow," and the early and late rice were also excellent varieties. After discussion, everyone clarified the main ways to increase production next year: First, increase the multiple cropping index, second, expand the area of high-yield crops, and third, implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture according to local conditions and without violating agricultural time.

Members Discuss Plans as Masters, Implement According to Local Conditions to the Field

On the basis of summarizing high-yield experiences and finding the key to increase production, the Party branch adopted the mass line method of combining from bottom to top and from top to bottom to formulate the 1961 production plan. The Party branch organized cadres, experienced old farmers, and some members to go deep into the fields to classify the land of the entire team, and according to soil quality, water conservancy, labor, and other conditions, put forward arrangements for crop area and variety for each sub-team, and then fully mobilized the members by sub-team to implement the plan to the field by arranging land, labor, and seasons. Finally, the Party branch, according to the opinions discussed by the members of each sub-team, put forward revised opinions after comprehensive balance, and then handed them over to the members for discussion and decision. The discussion results were: of the team's 2,100 mu of land, the grain area was 1,940 mu, accounting for 92.5%; the area of economic crops such as vegetables, peanuts, and sesame was 160 mu, accounting for 7.5%. Among the area planted with grain, according to soil quality, water conservancy, and other conditions, it was divided into four categories: 855 mu with good soil quality and guaranteed water conservancy, planted with wheat and early and late rice, three crops a year; 675 mu with good soil quality and poor water conservancy conditions, planted with wheat, early and mid-season rice, and corn and sweet potatoes, also three crops a year; 20 mu of thin soil and rain-fed land, planted with wheat and summer sweet potatoes, two crops a year; 390 mu of cold water and deep mud rotten paddy fields, most of which have been improved in soil, planted with two or three crops, and a small number of which are difficult to improve planted with single-season late rice. As a result of this arrangement, the annual grain sowing area is 4,849 mu, and the multiple cropping index reaches 250%, which is 10% higher than the commune's original idea. Everyone believes that as long as we work hard according to the plan, the annual grain production increase plan can be fully realized. The members said with satisfaction: "This plan truly reflects everyone's opinions. We will do what we say and guarantee its realization!" Now, after discussion by the members of each sub-team, specific measures for implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture have been formulated according to local conditions.

Plan Takes Root and Blossoms, Everywhere is Full of Vitality

The implementation of the production plan has further mobilized the enthusiasm of the members. A competition to surpass the contracted production and exceed the plan immediately started between sub-teams and between operating groups, with vigorous expansion of planting, accumulation of fertilizer, and cultivation of spring flowers. At present, the entire team has planted 1,335 mu of wheat and barley, more than double the amount of last year; 360 mu of green manure have been fully ditched and drained, covered with grass to prevent frost; 400 mu of rotten winter fields have also begun to be plowed early; the winter fertilizer accumulation campaign has begun; field management is adhering to high standards, and spring flowers are growing well. While doing a good job in collective production, the members are also raising more piglets and vigorously developing "100 jin of grain" by using field corners, wasteland, and grave mounds. A prosperous and lively scene has emerged throughout the team.

    蔡家生产队制订明年生产规划经验好
    群众当家作主计划落脚生根
    制订增产措施重视因地制宜
    据浙江日报消息　在农业生产上，如何做到既有积极领导、又让群众充分当家作主；既坚持党的方针政策，根据国家计划办事，又实事求是，因地制宜。浙江江山县清湖公社蔡家生产队提供了一个很好的范例。
    吸取经验教训提高思想认识
    蔡家生产队党支部在充分发动群众，讨论制订1961年生产规划时，首先在干部中开展了“怎样才能使计划在群众中落脚生根，真正起到指导和推动生产的作用”的讨论。讨论中，大家回忆了几年来领导生产的经验，总结了浮桥头小队和新塘底小队制订计划的经验教训。去年，浮桥头小队在制订1960年的生产计划时，首先由干部同老农商量，根据土质、水利等条件，对土地进行分类排队，因地制宜地提出作物面积、品种的安排意见，然后发动社员充分讨论，把计划落实到丘。社员们真正把计划当作自己的事，千方百计努力实现。结果，今年这个小队的早中稻和后熟作物都超过包产指标，得到了超产奖励。新塘底小队在制订生产计划时，没有经过群众充分讨论，社员执行计划不够认真，结果，今年没有完成包产指标。经过讨论，大家认识到要订好计划，首先要按照党的方针政策和国家计划办事；同时，必须充分发动群众，由群众当家作主，实事求是，因地制宜。
    交代方针任务分析有利条件
    党支部特别对社员进行了大办农业、大办粮食的教育，提出明年农业生产要力争比以往任何一年都好的要求，并反复说明农业生产必须坚持以粮为纲、全面发展和多种高产多收的方针。社员们在讨论中认真分析了全面贯彻执行政策以后出现的大好形势和力争明年农业大丰收的有利条件，这就是：一，社员掌握了党的政策，生产热情越来越高；二，经过连续三年的大跃进，积累了丰富的增产经验；三，投入农业生产第一线的劳动力大大增加了；四，今年春花面积大，种得适时，生长好；五，干部作风改进，坚持实行“四同”。经过分析讨论，社员们一致认识到只要充分利用这些有利条件，鼓足更大干劲，明年农业生产一定能够搞得比以往任何一年都好。
    总结高产经验  找出增产关键
    在充分进行思想发动以后，党支部又进一步发动社员摆产量、比高低，总结高产经验，找出增产关键。社员们摆出了历年来各小队的粮食产量，经过比较，从年份上看，以1958年产量最高；从生产小队看，以卫星小队增产幅度最大。大家就总结了1958年的经验和卫星小队的经验，主要有三条：一，认真贯彻执行多种高产多收的方针，提高复种指数，多种高产作物。卫星小队全年粮食复种指数达到256％，比全生产队平均复种指数高出67％；全小队六十四亩田，有五十三亩种了双季晚稻或玉米、番薯等高产作物。二，因地制宜地贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，做到合理密植，施足基肥，高标准管理。1958年全生产队水稻普遍达到每亩密植二万五千丛至三万丛以上，早稻在“立夏”前全部插下，亩亩施足基肥。卫星小队还做了三个自动灰窑，常年烧灰积肥，早稻基肥更足。在管理方面，全生产队早、中稻普遍做到三、四次耘田施肥。三，作物品种搭配好。卫星小队小麦都是“矮粒多”，大麦都是“立夏黄”，早、晚稻也是优良品种。经过讨论，大家明确了明年增产的主要途径：一是提高复种指数，二是扩大高产作物面积，三是因地制宜贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，不违农时。
    社员当家讨论规划  因地制宜落实到田
    在总结高产经验、找出增产关键的基础上，党支部就采取由下而上和由上而下相结合的群众路线方法，制订1961年的生产计划。党支部组织干部、有经验的老农和部分社员深入田间，对全队土地进行分类排队，根据土质、水利、劳力等条件，提出各小队作物面积、品种的安排意见，然后以小队为单位充分发动社员，通过排土地、排劳力、排季节，把规划具体落实到田。最后，党支部根据各小队社员讨论的意见，经过综合平衡，提出修正意见，再交给社员讨论决定。讨论结果是：全队二千一百亩土地，粮食面积一千九百四十亩，占92.5％；蔬菜、花生、芝麻等经济作物面积一百六十亩，占7.5％。在种植粮食的面积中，根据土质、水利等条件，又分成四类：土质好、水利有保证的八百五十五亩，种麦和早、晚稻，一年三熟；土质好、水利条件较差的六百七十五亩，种麦、早中稻和玉米、番薯，也是一年三熟；土质瘠薄的靠天田二十亩，种麦和夏番薯，一年两熟；水冷泥深的烂水田三百九十亩，大部分经过改良土壤，种两熟或三熟，少数不易改良的种单季晚稻。这样安排的结果，全年粮食播种面积为四千八百四十九亩，复种指数达到250％，比公社原来的设想提高10％。大家认为，只要踏踏实实照规划干下去，全年粮食增产计划完全有可能实现。社员满意地说：“这个规划真正反映了大家的意见，我们说到做到，保证实现！”现在，各小队经过社员讨论，已因地制宜地订出了执行农业“八字宪法”的具体措施。
      计划落脚生根  到处生气勃勃
    生产计划落实，进一步调动了社员的积极性。各小队与小队、操作组与操作组之间立即掀起了超包产、超计划的竞赛，大搞扩种，大积肥料，大力培育春花。目前，全队已种了大小麦一千三百三十五亩，比去年扩大一倍多；三百六十亩绿肥已经全部开沟排水，盖草防冻；四百亩烂冬田也开始提早冬耕；冬季积肥运动已经开展起来；田间管理坚持高标准，春花生长很好。在搞好集体生产的同时，社员们还增养小猪，利用田头地角、荒滩坟墩大搞“百斤粮”。全队出现一片生气勃勃的兴旺景象。
