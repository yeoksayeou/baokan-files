　　Four Things to Note for Pigs Overwintering

　　In winter, pigs are generally weak and have reduced cold resistance due to insufficient feed and nutritional imbalances. Therefore, extra attention should be paid to the insulation conditions, feeding management, and disease prevention of pigsties during the cold season. Now, let's talk about these aspects separately.
　　Preventing Pigs from Huddling Together Due to Cold
　　If the insulation conditions of the pigsty are poor in winter and there are too many pigs in each pen, the phenomenon of pigs huddling together for warmth will occur. Weak weaned piglets have poor cold resistance. Due to the cold, they climb on top of other pigs. When the pigs below move, they fall down and are crushed or killed. Pigs that huddle together easily sweat. When they suddenly disperse after sweating, they are prone to catching a cold.
　　In the Beijing area, the phenomenon of huddling generally begins when the sty temperature drops to three or four degrees Celsius. Huddling is most likely to occur in the evening and is most severe before dawn.
　　In addition to improving the cold-proofing and insulation work in the pigsty, some effective methods used by the masses can also be adopted to prevent deaths from huddling. The masses' methods for preventing huddling include: 1. Separate feeding. Each pen should contain no more than four adult pigs and no more than six newly weaned piglets. This way, even if they huddle, it is not easy for them to pile up. 2. Check on the pigs at night. Starting when the temperature reaches zero degrees, the night shift feeder should get up twice a night to check on the pigs. The purpose of this is to prevent the pigs from huddling for a long time, and to encourage them to move around and excrete feces and urine outside the nest. 3. Add a feeding at night. Starting in December, add a feeding of hot food with a temperature above thirty-five degrees every night. This hot food does not necessarily need to fill the pigs up, its function is to increase body heat after eating.
　　Cold Protection and Insulation of Pigsties
　　Cold protection and insulation of pigsties should focus on the following aspects: 1. Repair and build pens. First, check whether the pigsties are sufficient, and quickly build more if there are shortages. For the original pens, check their insulation performance and block any air leaks. If the north wall is too thin, it should be thickened with earth. If the original door opened to the north, it should be changed to open to the south. 2. Remodel warm pens. Choose the better original single-row, single-compartment pigsties, raise the sides of the south-facing pen into a sloping surface, and cover it with a straw curtain that can be rolled up and down. This type of warm pen is suitable for farrowing sows, suckling piglets, and sick or weak pigs. Open it during the day (on sunny days) and cover it at night and during windy or snowy weather. 3. Lay bedding straw. When the lowest temperature reaches zero degrees, bedding straw should be laid for piglets. Boars and adult pigs can be laid with sand before December, and straw can be laid after December, depending on the specific situation. Rice straw and tree leaves have better insulation properties, followed by general weeds. 4. Make a fire or use a stove. During the severely cold "third nine" period, fires can be made in pig pens where sows are giving birth. This allows the piglets to be dried quickly after birth.
　　Stockpiling Winter Feed
　　There is very little food to eat in pastures in winter. If the quantity and quality of feed cannot meet the needs of pigs, they will lose weight, weaken, and even become ill and die. Many areas have suffered disasters this year, and both concentrated feed and roughage are in short supply, so more attention should be paid to solving this problem. In order to reserve enough winter feed, each pig farm must widely collect wild grass, wild vegetables, tree leaves, and agricultural processing by-products. Due to the lack of concentrated feed, more emphasis should be placed on processing coarse feed carefully to improve the palatability and digestibility of the feed.
　　There are many ways to process coarse feed carefully. The specific method for slurry feed is: cook and ferment feeds such as skins, shells, branches and leaves, and then grind them into a slurry with a water mill. When feeding the slurry, it should be heated or mixed with hot water to a suitable temperature.
　　Winter Pig Food Temperature
　　The temperature of pig food in winter should be kept at a suitable level. The temperature of pig food can be determined based on the average daily temperature. 1. When the average daily temperature is five to six degrees, the food temperature can be maintained at twenty-five to thirty degrees (higher in the morning and lower in the afternoon), which makes it easier for them to gain weight. The food temperature can be slightly higher for pregnant sows and supplementary piglets. 2. When the average daily temperature reaches below zero degrees, the food temperature should be raised to above thirty degrees. 3. In order to maintain the food temperature, it is best to use wooden troughs for feeding.

    猪只越冬应注意的四件事
    中国农业科学院农业气象研究室　黄世劻
    冬季，由于饲料不足和营养失调等原因，猪只一般比较瘦弱，抗寒能力减低。因此在寒冷季节，应该格外注意猪舍的保温条件、饲养管理和防疫等。现在围绕这些方面分别谈谈。
    防止猪只畏寒压堆
    如果冬季猪舍的保温条件不好，每栏养猪的头数过多，就会发生猪只畏寒拥挤压堆取暖的现象。瘦弱的断奶小猪抗寒力较差，由于畏寒而爬到其他猪的上面，当下面的猪翻动时，就落到下面而被压伤或压死。拥挤压堆猪只容易出汗，在出汗以后突然散开的时候，就会着凉感冒。
    北京地区，压堆现象一般是在舍温降到摄氏三到四度的时候开始出现。每天压堆是从天黑时开始，天亮前最严重。
    防止压堆致死的办法，除作好猪舍内的防寒保温工作外，还可以采用一些群众行之有效的办法。群众防止压堆的办法：1、分圈饲养。每圈成年猪不多于四头，刚断奶的小猪不多于六头，这样即使拥挤，也不易压堆起来。2、夜晚哄猪。从气温到达零度时开始，值夜班的饲养员每夜要起来哄猪两次。哄的目的一方面是不让猪长时间压堆；另一方面是促其活动并到窝外去排泄粪尿。3、夜间加一次喂食。从12月开始，每天夜间加喂一次食温在三十五度以上的热食。这次热食不一定让猪吃饱，作用在于吃后增加身体热量。
    猪舍的防寒保温
    猪舍的防寒保温，应抓这样几个方面：1、修盖栏舍。首先检查猪舍是否够用，缺少的赶紧增建。对原有圈舍，应检查它的保温效能，堵塞好透风的缝孔。北边墙过薄的，要用土加厚。原来北面开门的，应改为南面开门。2、改装暖圈。选择原来较好的单列式单仓的猪舍，南面栏两侧加高成斜面，上面搭上可以上下卷放的草帘。这种暖圈适宜给分娩母猪、哺乳仔猪和病弱猪使用。使用时白天（晴好天气时）打开，夜间和风雪天气盖上。3、铺褥草。在最低温度到达零度时，就要开始给仔猪铺褥草。克郎猪和成年猪，根据具体情况可以在12月以前铺沙子，12月以后开始铺草。褥草以稻草、树叶的保温性较好，其次是一般杂草。4、生火或生炉子。在天气严寒的“三九”期间，产仔的猪栏可以生火取暖。这样可以使出生后的仔猪能马上烤干湿毛。
    贮备好越冬饲料
    冬天放牧地能吃的食物很少，如果饲料的量和质不能适应猪只的需要，猪只就会掉膘、衰弱，甚至染病死亡。今年不少地区受灾，精料粗料都较缺乏，更应该注意解决这个问题。为了储备足够的越冬饲料，每个猪场，必须广泛收集野草、野菜、树叶和农业加工的副产品。由于精料缺乏，在饲料加工上更应当提倡粗料细作，以提高饲料的适口性和消化率。
    粗料细作的办法很多，浆汁饲料的具体做法是：把皮壳枝叶类的饲料煮熟并发酵，然后用水磨磨成浆汁。喂用浆汁的时候，应加热或兑热水到适宜的温度。
    冬季的猪食温度
    冬季的猪食，应当掌握适宜的温度，猪食温度可依日平均温度而定。1、日平均气温五度到六度时，食温可保持二十五到三十度（早上高些，下午低些），这样容易上膘。对怀孕母猪和补料仔猪，食温可稍高些。2、日平均气温到达零度以下时，食温的温度应提高到三十度以上。3、为了保持食温，最好采用木槽喂食。
