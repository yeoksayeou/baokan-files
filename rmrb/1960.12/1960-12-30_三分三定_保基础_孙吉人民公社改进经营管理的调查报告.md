"Three Divisions and Three Fixes" Guarantee the Foundation
—An Investigative Report on Improving Business Management in Sunji People's Commune
Bai Xinghua, Sha Yin, Ren Zhihao

Since April of this year, Sunji People's Commune in Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, has comprehensively implemented a labor management and financial management system of "Three Divisions and Three Fixes."

The basic content of "Three Divisions and Three Fixes" includes: taking the management area (i.e., production team, the basic accounting unit) as a unit, comprehensive and reasonable planning is done at the beginning of the year for the whole year's production labor and non-production labor, production costs and non-production costs; dividing by front (agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, culture, education, health, etc.), by item (or unit), and by time (by season and month), the labor force, expenses, and tasks are specifically assigned to each production team (i.e., production brigade, the basic unit for contracting production and organizing production) and each unit that uses labor and spends money. Then, a "Planned Expenditure Handbook" and a "Planned Labor Handbook" are established for each unit, to be managed by the负责人 in charge of each front or unit. The "Planned Labor Handbook" and "Planned Expenditure Handbook" have annual, seasonal, and monthly labor and expenditure plans. Each unit must record every work point used and every dime spent in the handbook, and calculate how much balance is left according to the plan. It is also stipulated that if there is no balance, no labor or money can be used in the future; expenditures that cross months or items will not be reimbursed; no work points can be recorded without a voucher, and work points that are recorded incorrectly will not be distributed as dividends.

The "Three Divisions and Three Fixes" plan is formulated annually by each management area separately, passed by the representative assembly of commune members or the commune members' assembly of the area, and then announced for implementation.

The Generation and Formation of "Three Divisions and Three Fixes"

The "Three Divisions and Three Fixes" management system of Sunji People's Commune originated in the Sunji Management Area. It was generated and formed in the mass economic activity analysis. At the beginning of this year's spring plowing production, the Sunji Management Area discovered two problems: one was that all trades and professions were starting at the same time, all reaching out for people and money. In the first quarter, non-production labor exceeded the plan by 12%, while production labor only completed 96% of the plan. In terms of the use of funds, in January alone, culture and education expenses cost more than 100 yuan more than last year, and management fees cost 120 yuan more, while production funds felt insufficient. Another problem was that too much production fund was spent in the first quarter. The ninth production team's total small-scale procurement fee for the whole year was only 120 yuan, but they spent 87 yuan at once. Because the third production team overspent on management fees, they挪用 production funds, which affected agricultural production. The commune members and production team leaders all had opinions on this matter.

What to do? After discussion, the Party General Branch of the Management Area decided on the following: hand over the family property, everyone share the burden, and carry out mass economic activity analysis. The Party branch brought out the year's production plan indicators, agricultural work arrangements, and labor and expense requests put forward by various parties, all in one package. Everyone first calculated the labor account based on the family property: at that time, 220,000 work points were contracted in agriculture. Calculated on the basis of 300 work points per year for full and semi-laborers, 700 laborers were needed every day; animal husbandry and canteens needed to arrange 130 laborers; and basic construction required another 246 laborers. Adding these together, 1,076 laborers had to be arranged every day. But the entire management area actually only had 890 laborers, and if the work points occupied by kindergartens, spare-time middle schools, and health departments were removed, there wouldn't even be that many laborers. Then calculate the expenditure account: the total income planned at the beginning of the year was 660,000 yuan, with 20% allocated for production investment, totaling 132,000 yuan, 84,100 yuan was allocated for public accumulation fund, 10,395 yuan was planned for public welfare fund, and 2,640 yuan was planned for management fees. The total calculation was 229,135 yuan. The entire expenditure plan was higher than last year. Spending money in this way would inevitably lead to deficits.

Having found the problem, the solution followed. Based on the year's production plan, everyone first arranged the year's labor investment plan, resulting in: agricultural labor accounting for 58% of the total annual labor investment, animal husbandry accounting for 11%, sideline occupations accounting for 10.02%, cultural education accounting for 0.4%, welfare accounting for 8.2%, forestry accounting for 0.4%, and other accounting for 11.98% of the total annual labor investment.

With this plan, production was guaranteed, other aspects were taken care of, and the problem of insufficient labor was resolved. On this basis, everyone also proposed: the management area and production teams sign three-guarantee contracts. The work points allocated to each team only had a large number, with no arrangement for priorities, and only planned by front. The total annual labor investment plan of each front wasn't assigned separately to each unit and project that used labor, and wasn't divided by time, other fronts could still impact the agricultural front. The Party branch felt that everyone's opinion was very good, so they adopted it. They made detailed plans for the labor investment of each front by unit or project, by season, and by month, and then passed it at the commune members' meeting and issued a "Planned Labor Handbook" to each unit that used labor.

Everyone also re-rationally planned production costs, management fees, public accumulation fund, and public welfare fund from the implemented annual income plan, and reduced the allocated expenses by 30 percent, assigning them by front, by unit (project), and by time (season, month). A "Planned Expenditure Handbook" was also issued to each unit.

As a result, each unit acted in accordance with the "Planned Expenditure Handbook" and the "Planned Labor Handbook." The commune members felt it was good, the team leaders also said it was good, the cadres of the management area had a bottom line in their minds, and it was convenient to指挥. The Commune Party Committee immediately summarized their experience and held an on-site meeting of the entire commune in Sunji Management Area to promote it.

Three Boundaries, Decentralized Management, Basic Stabilization, Consistent Implementation

This method has seen new developments in the process of promotion. After the Zhao Village Management Area separated and assigned the number of labor points, it found that implementation was still quite difficult. All industries and professions were afraid that their plans would not be completed, so they all organized "specialized teams." The Party General Branch Committee discussed this situation in a timely manner, believing that merely controlling the labor investment plan in labor management and not basically stabilizing the labor force needed by the agricultural front, the "three-guarantee contract" was still in danger of being disrupted; if the production team's contracting plan could not be completed, the policy of basing on agriculture could still not be well implemented. Therefore, everyone discussed and set three boundaries in the allocation of labor: one was that when conflicts occurred between production and non-production, non-production unconditionally obeyed production; the second was that when conflicts occurred between agricultural production and forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fisheries, and basic construction, other production obeyed agricultural production; the third was that agriculture used busy times to exchange for idle times, and other sectors avoided busy times and took idle times. At the same time, a two-level separate management system for labor use was also determined. According to the indicators stipulated by the "Three Divisions and Three Fixes," the fixed labor force belonging to the production team was mobilized and managed by the production team; the small amount of labor force belonging to the management area, such as the labor force used in sideline occupations, was mobilized by the management area. However, the management area also had the power to supervise the production team's use of labor to prevent the production team from using labor casually for non-production purposes, affecting the completion of contracting tasks. After determining the two-level management, three specific forms of labor arrangement were found: one was that if specialized teams could and should be fixed, they should be fixed. The second was not to build specialized teams, but to have basic troops, such as on the main offensive front—agriculture, a basic team of more than 1,600 people was determined. This team accounted for 80% of the total labor force. The third was a mobile force, which participated in agricultural labor during normal times and supported other fronts during idle times.

The basic stabilization of the labor force and the implementation of the "Three Divisions and Three Fixes" for the number of labor points are mutually causal. Without the basic stabilization of the labor force, the "Three Divisions and Three Fixes" would easily miscarry; without the "Three Divisions and Three Fixes," the basic stabilization of the labor force would have no basis. At the same time, the basic stabilization of the labor force by front made the promotion of the "Four Fixes" and "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system more reliably guaranteed. In terms of achieving the labor investment plan, the basic stabilization of the labor force was the first line of defense for the "Three Divisions and Three Fixes." However, the basic stabilization of the labor force was different from the "Three Divisions and Three Fixes," and it should be more flexible. Therefore, the number of people fixed by the Zhao Village Management Area in the basic stabilization of the labor force was the minimum number necessary for each production and work.

Three boundaries, decentralized management, basic stabilization, and appropriate flexibility form a chain to guarantee the implementation of the "Three Divisions and Three Fixes" in labor management in the Zhao Village Management Area.

However, this method only solved the problem of mutual competition for labor between production and non-production in the management area, and between agricultural production and other production. The Zhao Village Management Area encountered new problems in the process of implementing the "Three Divisions and Three Fixes": from the arrangement point of view, the labor force was up, but the attendance rate and labor efficiency of each production team could not complete the plan, resulting in the total labor investment plan not being completed. Therefore, they adopted the "four-day continuous set" method: according to the labor investment indicators of the "Three Divisions and Three Fixes" for the labor force, the monthly labor investment of each production team was divided into grades and levels and assigned to the names of the commune members. Each commune member was assigned a basic attendance day and a basic work day for each month. At the end of the month, the actual work day and actual attendance day were calculated. If both exceeded the quota, an appropriate reward was given for the excess; if both indicators were not completed and there was no legitimate reason, an appropriate penalty was given. In conjunction with this method, a monthly pre-payment of wages system was implemented, plus group work and small-section contracting, forming another chain to guarantee the implementation of the "Three Divisions and Three Fixes" in labor management. This chain扎根 the root of the "Three Divisions and Three Fixes" from the management area to the production team, from the production team to the work group, and from the work group to the commune members. The "Three Divisions and Three Fixes" had a guarantee for implementation, and the provisions on labor in the "Four Fixes" and "Three Guarantees and One Reward" were also implemented. The labor investment plan for the second quarter of the entire management area was completed very well.

Two Principles, Mass Supervision, Both Open Source and Cost Reduction

In financial management, if there is only "Three Divisions and Three Fixes" and no effective measures for implementation, the "Three Divisions and Three Fixes" will become a formality, or at least damage the role it should play in directing production.

In this regard, the practices of the Jia Village Management Area are worth introducing. They stipulated two principles: overspending will not be reimbursed, and cross-item expenditure is not allowed. In implementing these two principles, they explored a set of methods to attract the masses to participate in supervision. That is: each production team and money-spending unit should regularly explain their底细 to the commune members, accept the criticisms and suggestions of the commune members, and let everyone take on the burden of managing funds. As a result of this mass supervision, many things that should have been done by spending money in the entire area were done without spending money or spending less money. For example, the eight large carts originally planned to be repaired in the machine factory by the management area were repaired by the commune members themselves, saving 480 yuan; the large rope originally planned to be bought was replaced with waste products, saving 162 yuan. There were no more overspending phenomena in the entire area. Of the eight production expenses originally ordered, six items in the first quarter exceeded the plan by 33%, while the actual expenditure from April to September was 11.4% lower than the plan. Management fees in the second and third quarters were 15% lower than the plan. The actual expenditure of the four public welfare fund projects in the second and third quarters was 46.3% lower than the plan. The expenditure of the public accumulation fund in the second and third quarters was 22% lower than the plan.

Grasping open source mainly relies on economic activity analysis. The Jia Village Management Area has at least six relatively large-scale economic activity analyses a year. At the beginning of the year, during spring plowing production, before and after summer harvest, and before and after autumn harvest, each economic activity analysis must calculate the accounts to see if the income can complete the plan. If loopholes are found, they must start early to find ways. Before the summer harvest this year, they organized an economic activity analysis. At that time, the management area estimated that the average yield of wheat was 128 jin per mu. Everyone analyzed and said: the estimated wheat yield is not realistic. There were quite a lot of wheat planted last year, which did not grow well, and there were also three types of fields, and there was also "spotted wheat," with incomplete seedlings, at most 104 jin per mu on average. According to this calculation, the total wheat production for the whole year may be reduced by more than 144,000 jin, equivalent to more than 15,800 yuan. This loophole must be filled. Therefore, everyone started to find measures to increase production; at the same time, they also found two ways to increase income in sideline occupations. Sideline occupations plus grain, fully accounted for, the net income was more than 18,000 yuan, which made up for the hole pulled by wheat. With income in place, the "Three Divisions and Three Fixes" are naturally guaranteed.

The "Three Divisions and Three Fixes" are determined by the management area, and the main implementing unit is still the management area, but the commune must also be responsible. Therefore, two regulations were made: one was that the commune's departments should strictly limit the dispatch of work to the management area. The second was that no department of the commune was allowed to dispatch money-spending matters outside of the "Three Divisions and Three Fixes" to the management area. If any department dispatches it, the management area has the right to refuse to implement it.

At the same time, the Wanrong County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also set three disciplines, namely: First: All money-spending and labor-using matters arranged by county-level departments to the lower levels must not exceed the original labor investment and expenditure plans of the lower levels. Second: For all approved transfers of rural labor, the travel expenses, living expenses, and wage subsidies of the dispatched personnel shall be borne by the unit that transfers the labor. Third: No matter what department holds any on-site meeting, it is not allowed to ask the management area for people and money.

The commune's two articles and the county's three articles have established a solid line of defense for the management area's "Three Divisions and Three Fixes."

The benefits of "Three Divisions and Three Fixes" are many, the most important of which is to ensure agriculture as the main focus and to ensure the implementation of the three-level ownership system

It has been more than eight months since Sunji People's Commune comprehensively promoted the "Three Divisions and Three Fixes" system in April this year, and its role has been fully demonstrated. It has guaranteed agricultural production, adhered to the basic ownership of the management area, adhered to the small part of the ownership of the production team, mobilized the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members, and promoted the all-round great leap forward of various productions and works centered on agriculture.

The core of "Three Divisions and Three Fixes" is to protect production and protect the foundation. It can concentrate superior forces and financial resources in a planned way according to the spirit of "taking agriculture as the main focus and making overall arrangements," and strengthen the front line of agricultural production. After the "Three Divisions and Three Fixes" were promoted in April this year, the number of people participating in agricultural labor accounted for 80.05% of the total labor force. The labor investment for the entire agricultural production plan in the second and third quarters was 5.7% more than the plan, accounting for 85% of the total actual labor investment. In terms of the use of funds, the management fees of the ten management areas of the entire commune decreased by 26% compared with the plan. The expenditure of the public accumulation fund decreased by 33.9% compared with the plan, and the expenditure of the public welfare fund decreased by 44% compared with the plan. All departments saved funds to ensure production, and production was carefully calculated, without spending any idle money. As a result, the production costs of the entire commune decreased by 12.8% compared with the plan. As a result, funds were available as a reserve.

The basic task of the management area is to grasp production. Only by grasping production can we guarantee income, and then guarantee the expansion of reproduction and continuously improve the living standards of commune members. The "Three Divisions and Three Fixes" has played a particularly obvious role in this regard since its implementation. Because it guarantees that the front line of production is strong and well-equipped, and that funds are sufficient. This year, although we have encountered a severe drought that has not occurred in nearly a century, and the field management tasks for wheat and cotton have increased by at least half compared to previous years, and the replanting area has expanded by 15,000 mu compared to last year, the inter-tillage and moisture conservation of wheat and cotton fields throughout the year have been done better than in any previous year, the replanting task was completed four days ahead of schedule, the cotton field management was more meticulous than in any year, and the late autumn crops broke the historical habit and applied fertilizer twice and inter-tilled three times. As a result, the growth and harvest of crops are still very good, especially cotton and late autumn crops, which are incomparable to those in previous years.

The "Three Divisions and Three Fixes" itself guarantees the active role of the basic ownership of the management area. In addition, the five systems stipulated by the county and commune levels to guarantee the smooth implementation of the "Three Divisions and Three Fixes" meant that the temporary and unplanned money-spending and labor-using matters dispatched by the county and commune to the management area were almost gone.

The "Three Divisions and Three Fixes" not only promoted the planned management of finance and labor in various management areas, and placed the financial and labor management of the entire area under the supervision of the broad masses of commune members, reducing waste, but also made cadres and commune members understand the family property, and promoted their enthusiasm to open up new ways, increase production, and increase income. It played a role in promoting poor management areas to catch up with rich areas at high speed and rich areas to become richer and richer. Last year, the average income of commune members in Sunji People's Commune was below 80 yuan. This year, because more ways to produce were found and more expenses were saved, the average income of commune members throughout the year was above 90 yuan. The commune has repaid 44% of the loans from the state, and all the debts owed to the commune members have been paid off. In May and June, the management areas began to implement the monthly payment of wages system one after another, and everyone was satisfied. The commune members said: "The Three Divisions and Three Fixes are a treasure, every production is leaping forward, managing affairs diligently and frugally saves money, and life is getting better and better."

The entire spirit of "Three Divisions and Three Fixes" lies in the fact that it can take care of other aspects while guaranteeing agriculture as the foundation. Although there have only been a few "润皮皮雨" in the past nine months or so, and the drought has been really tough, the crops of Sunji People's Commune are still growing quite well. In terms of grain crops, in addition to the reduction in wheat production due to severe disasters, the total grain output of autumn crops increased by 10% compared to last year. There has also been a great increase in other production. The great development of forestry, sideline occupations, and animal husbandry has provided sufficient funds for agriculture. This mutual cause and effect, and mutual promotion, has led to a great leap forward in all industries and professions with agriculture as the main focus.

    “三分三定”保基础
    ——孙吉人民公社改进经营管理的调查报告
    白兴华、莎荫、任志浩
    山西省万荣县孙吉人民公社从今年4月开始，全面推行了“三分三定”的劳动管理和财务管理制度。
    “三分三定”的基本内容包括：以管理区（即生产队，基本核算单位）为单位，在年初就对全年生产用工和非生产用工、生产费用和非生产费用，做出全面合理的规划；分战线（农、林、牧、副、文教卫生等）分项目（或单位）、分时间（分季分月），把劳力、费用、任务，具体定到各个生产队（即生产小队，包产和组织生产的基层单位）和各个用工、花钱单位。然后，给各单位建立“计划开支手册”和“计划用工手册”，由各条战线或单位的负责人掌握。“计划用工手册”和“计划开支手册”上有全年、分季、分月的用工、花钱计划，各单位用一个工、花一角钱，都要记入手册，并且算出按照计划还有多少余额。同时还规定：没有了余额，以后就不能用工、花钱；跨月跨项开支，不予报销；没有凭证不能用工，乱记的工分不给分红。
    “三分三定”方案在每年年初由各个管理区分别制定，由本区社员代表大会或社员大会通过，然后公布执行。
    “三分三定”的产生和形成过程
    孙吉人民公社的“三分三定”管理制度最早出在孙吉管理区。它是在群众性经济活动分析中产生和形成的。今年春耕生产刚刚开始，孙吉管理区发现了这么两个问题：一个是行行业业齐上马，都伸手要人要钱。第一季度下来，非生产用工超过计划12％，而生产用工却只完成计划的96％。在资金使用上，1月份光文教费就比去年多花了一百多元，管理费多花了一百二十元，而生产资金却感到不足。另一个问题是：第一季度生产资金也花得太多，第九生产队全年包干的小型购置费不过一百二十元，可是他们一次就花了八十七元。第三生产队因为管理费用超支，把生产费用都挪用了，使农业生产受到了影响。社员、生产队长们对这事儿都有意见。
    怎么办？管理区党总支经过讨论，决定了这么一条：交代家底子，大家担担子，开展群众性的经济活动分析。党支部把今年的生产计划指标、农活安排，各方面提出的劳力要求、费用要求，一盘子托了出来。大家根据家底先算了劳力账：当时农业上包出二十二万个工，按全、半劳动力每年做三百个工算，每天需要有七百个劳动力；畜牧业、食堂要安排一百三十个劳力；基本建设还得二百四十六个劳力。把这些加起来，每天就得安排一千零七十六个劳力。但全管理区实际上只有八百九十个劳力，如果再把幼儿园、业余中学和卫生部门占用的工除了，连这么多的劳力也没有。再算开支账：年初规划的总收入是六十六万元，生产投资抽20％，总共是十三万二千元，公积金抽八万四千一百元，公益金计划了一万零三百九十五元，管理费计划了二千六百四十元。一总计算是二十二万九千一百三十五元。整个开支计划比去年高。这样用钱，必然入不敷出。
    找到毛病，办法也跟着出来了。大家根据全年的生产计划，先安排了全年的投工计划，结果是：农业用工占全年总投工的58％，畜牧业占11％，副业占10.02％，文化教育占0.4％，生活福利占8.2％，林业占0.4％，其它占全年总投工的11.98％。
    这么一规划，生产保证了，其它也照顾了，劳力不够用的问题解决了。在这个基础上，大家又提出：管理区和生产队签订三包合同，各队用工光有大数，没有轻重缓急的安排，光分战线规划，不把各战线的全年投工计划分别定到各个用工单位和项目上，不分开时间，其他战线还有可能冲击农业战线。党支部觉得大家的这条意见很好，就采纳了。他们把各战线的投工分单位或项目，分季、分月作了详细的规划，然后在社员大会上通过，给各个用工单位发了一本“计划用工手册”。
    大家还按照实际情况，把全年总收入指标落实为四十七万元。从落实的全年收入计划中，重新合理地规划了生产费、管理费、公积金和公益金。然后，把提取的费用打了个七折，分战线、分单位（项目）、分时间季、月）定下去。也给各单位发了一本“计划开支手册”。
    这么一来，各单位都按“计划开支手册”和“计划用工手册”办事，社员觉得好，队长们也说不错，管理区的干部心里有了底，指挥起来也方便了。公社党委马上总结了他们的经验，在孙吉管理区开了全社的现场会议予以推广。
    三条界线，分级管理，基本固定，一竿到底
    这个办法在推广的过程中又有了新的发展。赵村管理区把投工数量分开来，定下去以后，发现执行起来还是挺费劲。各行各业都怕自己的计划完不成，都组织个
  “专业队”。党总支委员会及时地讨论了这一情况，认为在劳动管理上仅仅控制投工计划，而不把农业战线需要的劳力基本固定下来，“三包合同”仍然有被打乱的危险；如果生产队的包工计划不能完成，以农业为基础的方针仍然不能很好贯彻。于是，大家商量着在调配劳力上定了三条界线：一条是生产与非生产发生矛盾时，非生产无条件服从生产；第二条是农业生产和林、牧、副、渔、基本建设发生矛盾时，其它生产服从农业生产；第三条是农业以忙换闲，其它避忙就闲。同时又确定了劳力使用上的两级分别管理制度。根据“三分三定”所规定的指标，属于生产队的固定劳力，由生产队调动与管理；属于管理区的少许劳力，如副业方面用的劳力，由管理区调动。但是，管理区也有对生产队使用劳力的监督权力，以防止生产队把劳力随便用于非生产方面，影响包产任务完成。确定两级管理以后，又找出了具体安排劳力的三种形式：一种是可以也应该固定专业队的，就固定专业队。第二种是不建专业队，但是有基本部队，如在主攻战线——农业上，就确定了一支基本队伍，总共一千六百多人。这支队伍占劳力总数的80％。第三种是机动部队，平时参加农业劳动，闲时支援其它战线。
    基本固定劳力和投工数量实行“三分三定”是互为因果的，没有劳力的基本固定，“三分三定”就容易流产，没有“三分三定”，劳力的基本固定就没有凭据。同时，分战线实行劳力基本固定，又使“四固定”、“三包一奖”制度的推行得到了更可靠的保证。就实现投工计划来说，基本固定劳力是“三分三定”的第一道防线，但是，基本固定劳力又和“三分三定”不同，它应该更灵活些。因此，赵村管理区在基本固定劳力中，所固定的人数都是属于各项生产、工作所必需的最低限度的。
    三条界线，分级管理，基本固定，适当灵活，这就结成了赵村管理区保证劳动管理“三分三定”贯彻执行的一条锁链。
    但是，这办法只解决了管理区生产和非生产之间、农业生产和其它生产之间的互争劳力的问题。赵村管理区在执行“三分三定”过程中又遇到了新的问题：从安排上看，劳力是上去了，可是各个生产队的劳动出勤率和劳动效率完不成计划，结果总的投工计划也完不成。于是，他们采取了“四日连环套”的办法：根据劳力的
  “三分三定”的投工指标，把各个生产队每月投工量分等分级定到社员的名下。给每个社员确定每月的基本出勤日和基本劳动日，月终结算实际劳动日和实际出勤日，两项都超过定额的，超额部分给予适当奖励；两项指标都完不成，又没正当理由的，给予适当处罚。配合这个办法，又实行了按月预发工资的制度，再加小组作业、小段包工，就结成了保证实现劳动管理“三分三定”的又一条锁链。这条锁链使“三分三定”的根子一下从管理区扎到生产队，从生产队扎到作业组，从作业组扎到社员身上去了。“三分三定”有了贯彻执行的保证，“四固定”、“三包一奖”中关于劳力的规定，也落实了。全管理区第二季度的投工计划完成得很好。
    两个原则，群众监督，既抓开源，又抓节流
    在财务管理上，仅仅有“三分三定”，而没有一套贯彻执行的得力措施，“三分三定”也会流于形式，至少会损害它在指挥生产中应该发挥的作用。
    在这方面，贾村管理区的作法是值得介绍的。他们规定了两个原则：超支不予报销，跨项不准开支。在执行这两条原则中，他们又摸索出一套吸引群众参加监督的办法。这就是：各个生产队和花钱单位，经常地给社员交代家底，接受社员的批评和建议，让大家担起管理资金的担子。这样大闹群众监督的结果，全区有不少该花钱办的事，没有花钱或只花较少的钱就办好了。例如管理区原计划在机厂修理的八辆大车，社员自己修好了，少花了四百八十元；原计划买的大绳，用废品代替了，少花了一百六十二元。全区没有再发生超支现象，生产费用原来订的八个项目，第一季度有六项比计划超支33％，而4至9月份实际开支比计划降低了11.4％。管理费二、三季度比计划降低了15％。公益金的四个项目，二、三季度实开支比计划降低了46.3％。公积金的开支二、三季度比计划降低了22％。
    抓开源，主要是依靠经济活动分析。贾村管理区一年至少有六次规模比较大的经济活动分析。年初、春耕生产、夏收前后、秋收前后，每次经济活动分析都要算算账，看看收入能不能完成计划，如果发现漏洞，就要早点动手找门路。今年夏收前，他们就组织了一次经济活动分析，当时管理区给小麦估产是平均亩产一百二十八斤。大家分析说：小麦估产不实际，去年回茬麦挺多，长得不好，又有三类田，又有“花脸麦”，苗不全，至多平均一亩打一百零四斤，按这么算，全年光小麦可能少收十四万四千多斤，折合一万五千八百多块钱。这个漏洞必须填起来。于是，大家动手找增产措施；同时在副业上也找了两个门路，增加收入。副业加上粮食，满打满算纯收入一万八千多元，就把麦子拉下的窟窿全补起来了。收入有了着落，“三分三定”自然也就有了保证。
    “三分三定”由管理区定，主要执行单位仍然是管理区，但是公社也必须负责。因此作了两条规定：一条是公社各部门向管理区派工要严加限制。第二条是公社任何部门都不许向管理区派“三分三定”以外的花钱事。如果哪一部门派下去，管理区有权拒绝执行。
    与此同时，中共万荣县委也定了三条纪律，这就是：第一条：凡是县级各部门给下边布置花钱、用工的事，不许超过下边原订的投工和开支计划。第二条：凡是批准调用农村的劳力，被派人的旅差费、生活费、工资补助费都由调用劳力的单位负担。第三条：不论任何部门召开任何现场会议，都不许向管理区要人要钱。
    公社两条，县里三条，给管理区的“三分三定”建立起了一条牢靠的防线。
    “三分三定”的好处很多，最主要的是保证以农业为主，保证三级所有制的贯彻实现
    孙吉人民公社从今年4月全面推行“三分三定”制度，到现在共八个多月时间，它的作用已经充分地显示出来。它保证了农业生产，坚持了管理区的基本所有制，坚持了生产队的小部分所有制，调动了广大社员的生产积极性，促进了以农业为中心的各项生产和工作全面跃进。
    “三分三定”的核心是保生产、保基础，它能够按照“以农为主，全面安排”的精神，有计划地集中优势兵力和财力，加强农业生产第一线。今年4月“三分三定”推行以后，参加农业劳动的人数占到总劳力的80.05％，二、三两季度整个农业生产计划投工比计划多了5.7％，占到实际投工总数的85％。在资金使用上，全公社十个管理区的管理费比计划下降了26％。公积金支出比计划降低了33.9％，公益金支出比计划降低了44％。各部门都节约资金保证生产，而生产又精打细算，不花一个闲钱。结果，全公社的生产费用比计划降低了12.8％。这么一来，资金就有了后备。
    管理区的基本任务是抓生产，只有抓好生产，才能保证收入，进而保证扩大再生产和不断提高社员的生活水平。“三分三定”推行以后，在这方面起了特别明显的作用。因为它保证了生产第一线兵强马壮，资金充足。今年，虽然遇上了近百年来没有过的大旱，小麦和棉花的田间管理任务至少比往年增大一半，复播面积又比去年扩大了一万五千亩，可是，全年麦田和棉田的中耕保墒比以往任何一年做得都好，复播任务比计划提前四天完成，棉田管理比哪一年都细致，晚秋作物还一破历年的习惯，追了两次肥，中耕了三次。结果，庄稼的生长情形和收获情形还都挺好，特别是棉花和晚秋作物，是历年来所比不了的。
    “三分三定”本身就保证了管理区基本所有制的积极作用，再加上县、公社两级为保证“三分三定”顺利执行而规定的五条制度，县、公社分派给管理区的临时性的和计划以外的花钱、用工的事儿差不多没有了。
    “三分三定”既促进了各管理区财务、劳动的计划管理，使全区的财务、劳动管理置于广大社员监督之下，减少了浪费，也使干部、社员人人了解家底，促进了他们广开门路，增加生产，增加收入的积极性。对于穷管理区高速度赶上富区和富区越过越富起了促进作用。去年孙吉人民公社社员的平均收入在八十元以下，今年因为生产门路找得多，开支节约得多，全年社员的平均收入在九十元以上，全公社贷国家的款已经还了44％，欠社员的款全部还清了。5、6月，各管理区开始陆续实行了月月发工资制度，人人满意。社员们说：“三分三定是个宝，样样生产都飞跃，勤俭办事花钱少，日子越过越美好。”
    “三分三定”的全部精神在于：它在保证农业为基础的前提下，能够兼顾其它。虽然过去九个多月中只下过几场“润皮皮雨”，旱得实在够呛，可是孙吉人民公社的庄稼还是长得挺不错。粮食作物方面，除小麦因为受灾过重而减产外，大秋作物的粮食总产量比去年增加了10％。其它生产也有很大的增长。而林、副、牧业的大发展，又给农业提供了足够的资金。这样互为因果，互相促进，就来了个以农为主的行行业业齐跃进。
