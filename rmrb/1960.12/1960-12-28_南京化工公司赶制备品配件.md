Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing - Workers at the Nanjing Chemical Industry Company's machinery repair and manufacturing division are rushing to produce spare parts and accessories for various production equipment, striving to complete the reserve task of major spare parts and accessories required for the first quarter of next year ahead of schedule within the year, laying the foundation for continued leaps forward in production next year.

The Nanjing Chemical Industry Company is a chemical joint enterprise mainly producing chemical fertilizers. With the continuous expansion of the production scope, the production equipment has become more and more numerous, and the number of spare parts and accessories required for each equipment has greatly increased. When arranging next year's production preparation work in the fourth quarter, the company took the production of spare parts and accessories as the primary task of the machinery manufacturing department, requiring that more than 20 kinds of commonly used and critical spare parts and accessories should have a quarterly reserve volume within this year. For this reason, according to the technical, equipment and other conditions and the specifications requirements of spare parts and accessories, responsibilities were divided, items were contracted out, materials were put into production in batches, and production was carried out in batches. Therefore, the production efficiency of various spare parts and accessories has been rapidly improved, and the reserve volume has been greatly increased. For example, the spare parts and accessories required by the mineral fertilizer plant in the second half of this year have increased by more than double compared with the first half of the year, but by the end of November, the reserve volume of major spare parts and accessories has increased from 25% in the past to 50%.

    南京化工公司赶制备品配件
    据新华社南京电 南京化学工业公司机械修造职工，突击赶制各种生产设备的备品、配件，力争在年内提前完成明年一季度所需主要备品、配件的储备任务，为明年生产继续跃进打下基础。
    南京化学工业公司是一个以生产化肥为主的化工联合企业。随着生产范围的不断扩大，生产设备越来越多，所需的各项设备的备品、配件数量大大增加。第四季度安排明年的生产准备工作时，这个公司就把备品、配件生产作为机械制造部门的首要任务，要求在今年内使二十多种常用的、关键性的备品配件，能有一个季度的储备量。为此，根据技术、设备等条件和备品、配件的规格要求，分工负责，分项包干，成批投料，成批生产。因此，各种备品、配件的生产效率迅速提高，储备量大大增加。例如矿肥厂今年下半年需要的备品、配件比上半年增加了一倍多，到十一月底主要备品配件的储备量却由过去的百分之二十五增加到百分之五十。
