Xinhua News Agency report: The Party branch of Guozishi Street Elementary School in Xianyang City, Shaanxi Province, in order to cultivate children's love for agricultural labor, farmers, and the countryside, has been educating children about agriculture as the foundation of the national economy. Since the beginning of this year, it has been helping teachers reform teaching content and methods.

The school's socialist education classes and weekly meetings have compiled new teaching materials centered on "vigorously developing agriculture and grain production," and merged natural science and agricultural knowledge courses into general knowledge courses, adding content such as "local fertilizers" and "local pesticides." Many reforms have also been made in teaching methods. For example, lessons related to rural life and agricultural production are moved to the actual sites for teaching whenever possible. When teaching about pig farming, they go to the nearby commune's breeding room and invite the breeders to lecture; when teaching about "winter apple orchards," they go to the nearby orchards and invite workers to lecture. In this way, children not only learn production knowledge but also see how the farmers work diligently to increase grain and apple production. In addition, the school also uses school meetings, class meetings, morning meetings, and other opportunities to explain to children in simple terms the significance of "vigorously developing agriculture and grain production," and introduce advanced deeds of model figures on the agricultural front. They also organize children to visit communes, and invite commune cadres to introduce typical examples so that the children can understand the changes in agricultural production and people's lives before and after liberation. In order to obtain parental assistance, school teachers also conduct home visits in a planned way after the start of the school year. Combining the understanding of students' family life, they promote the Party's policies to parents.

Organizing children to participate in on- and off-campus production labor is another important aspect of Guozishi Street Elementary School's agricultural education. In addition to organizing teachers and students to plant some crops in scattered open spaces on and off campus according to the teaching plan for agricultural knowledge education, the school also pays special attention to continuously conducting ideological and political education for students through labor practice. Before each labor activity, teachers give the children some education and try to increase the opportunities for children to contact farmers. Through the above series of educational activities, the ideological outlook of the school's children has also undergone significant changes. Many children love agriculture and labor more than before, and the students' labor viewpoints have also been strengthened. They often automatically water and fertilize the crops in their small gardens during after-school hours and manage them carefully. Through labor practice, the children have also mastered certain agricultural scientific knowledge and production skills. Some of the older children have learned agricultural techniques such as grafting, breeding, and soil improvement.

    讲授政治教育课程参加校内外生产劳动
    果子市街小学教育儿童热爱农村
    据新华社讯　陕西省咸阳市果子市街小学党支部，为了培养儿童热爱农业劳动、热爱农民、热爱农村的思想感情向儿童进行农业是国民经济基础的教育，今年以来，帮助教师改革了教学内容和教学方法。
    学校的社会主义教育课、周会课都以“大办农业、大办粮食”为中心编写了新的教材，并把自然、农业常识课合并为常识课，增添了“土化肥”、“土农药”等内容。在教学方法上也进行了许多改革。例如，把与农村生活、农业生产有关的课文，尽可能地搬到现场去教学。讲养猪就到附近公社饲养室，请饲养员讲课；讲“冬天的苹果园”就到附近的果园请工人讲课。这样，儿童不仅学习了生产知识，而且看到了农民伯伯如何为增产粮食增产苹果进行着辛勤的劳动。此外，学校还利用校会、班会、晨会等各种机会，通俗地给儿童讲解“大办农业、大办粮食”的意义，介绍农业战线上模范人物的先进事迹；并组织儿童到公社参观、访问，请公社干部介绍一些典型事例使儿童们了解到解放前后农业生产和人民生活的变化。为了取得家长协助，学校教师在开学后还有计划地进行家庭访问，结合了解学生家庭生活，向家长宣传党的方针政策。
    组织儿童参加校内外生产劳动，是果子市街小学向儿童进行热爱农业教育的另一重要内容。学校除了按教学计划组织师生在校内外零星空地种植一些农作物，进行农业知识教育以外，还特别注意通过劳动实践不断对学生进行思想政治教育工作。每次劳动前，教师都给儿童进行一些教育，并尽量增加儿童与农民接触的机会。通过上述一系列的教育活动，这个学校的少年儿童的思想面貌也发生了显著的变化，许多孩子比以前更热爱农业热爱劳动了，学生的劳动观点也加强了，他们常在课余自动地给自己的小园地的农作物浇水、施肥，认真管理。通过劳动实践，还使儿童们掌握了一定的农业科学知识和生产技能，高年级部分儿童已学会嫁接、育种、改良土壤等农业技术。
