Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The China-Korea Friendship Association held a report meeting this afternoon in the Great Hall of the People, attended by 10,000 people from all walks of life in the capital. General Luo Ruiqing, Deputy Head of the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to Korea, Vice Premier of the State Council, and Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, delivered a report on the delegation's visit to Korea (full text on page four).

In his long report, General Luo Ruiqing warmly praised the friendship between the people of China and Korea, which is built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. He emphasized that the militant friendship between the people and armies of China and Korea, cemented with blood, will last forever. No matter what the circumstances, the Chinese people will stand with the fraternal Korean people. If the imperialists dare to invade us again, the people of China and Korea will once again join hands, fight side by side, and completely, cleanly, and thoroughly eliminate the invaders.

Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Marshal Chen Yi, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Peng Zhen and Chen Shutong, and Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Bao Erhan, attended today's report meeting.

Invited to attend the report meeting were Korean Ambassador to China Li Yonghao and diplomatic officials from the embassy.

In his report, General Luo Ruiqing vividly described the delegation's visit to Korea, expressed warm praise for the Korean Workers' Party and the Korean people's resolute opposition to imperialism, their active construction of socialism, and their firm implementation of internationalism. He also once again expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, the government of the Republic, the Korean people, and the Korean People's Army.

General Luo Ruiqing pointed out that the delegation's visit to Korea was a very pleasant, very satisfactory, and very beneficial visit, which gave us a profound education in proletarian internationalism.

General Luo Ruiqing said that the current situation in Korea is still in a state of north-south division due to the U.S. imperialism's insistence on implementing policies of aggression and war. The sinister purpose of U.S. imperialism is to turn southern Korea into a base for its military adventures, attempting to re-launch an offensive against northern Korea at a time it deems appropriate, annex the entire Korea, and undermine peace in the Far East and the world. The U.S. imperialist crimes in Korea prove that U.S. imperialism is the common vicious enemy of the Korean people, the Chinese people, and the people of the world.

He said that we are very excited to see that the Korean Workers' Party and the government resolutely expose the U.S. imperialist aggressive plots, constantly educate the people against U.S. imperialism, and raise the people's vigilance. At the same time, the Korean Workers' Party and the government have been conducting a consistent and unremitting struggle to achieve the peaceful reunification of their motherland, and have repeatedly put forward reasonable proposals for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. From their own experience, the Korean people have deeply realized that there can be no illusions about imperialism, and as long as the U.S. aggressor troops do not withdraw from southern Korea, the Korean people's anti-imperialist struggle will not stop. He said that the Korean Workers' Party and the heroic Korean people, who have undergone severe tests, are not only unafraid of imperialism and will not be intimidated by the U.S. imperialist atomic threats, but also are fully prepared for the U.S. imperialist attempt to re-launch a war of aggression. They have the firm determination and confidence to repel any provocations and aggressions by U.S. imperialism.

General Luo Ruiqing said that we believe that under the persistent and unyielding heroic struggle of the Korean people, and in the excellent situation where socialist forces are growing stronger and imperialist forces are weakening, the Korean people's cause of opposing imperialism and striving for the peaceful reunification of their motherland will surely achieve final victory. He said that during our visit, we also saw that Korea's post-war reconstruction and socialist construction have achieved astonishing and tremendous achievements in a short period of several years. After a three-year recovery period after the war, Korean industry began its first five-year economic construction plan in 1957. The industrial output value target of this plan was completed ahead of schedule in just two and a half years. This year's industrial output value has increased 2.5 times compared to 1956, 5.4 times compared to 1949 before the war, and 6.7 times compared to 1944 before liberation. Agriculture has fully realized cooperation, with one million households in the north organized into more than 3,800 cooperatives, and has basically realized water conservancy and electrification, and is vigorously striving to realize mechanization. Agriculture completed the grain production target of the first five-year plan one year ahead of schedule. Korea's cultural and educational undertakings are also relatively developed. The living standards of the people have also been significantly improved and raised. At the same time, he also praised the Korean people's fine style of hard work, simplicity, diligence and courage.

General Luo Ruiqing pointed out that the reason why Korea's socialist construction has achieved such great achievements is mainly the correct leadership of the Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, and the full enthusiasm of the entire Korean people; at the same time, the assistance of various fraternal countries to the Korean people has also played a certain role. He said that facts have proved that the line of building socialism at high speed put forward by the Korean Workers' Party is completely correct. Now, the Workers' Party has put forward a seven-year plan for the development of the national economy. The implementation of the seven-year plan will make Korea a developed socialist industrial country.

General Luo Ruiqing said that during the visit, we were pleased to see that our closest comrades-in-arms, the heroic Korean People's Army, have achieved great achievements in the struggle to defend peace and defend the motherland, and in further strengthening the army's construction. He said that the People's Army attaches great importance to the Party's leadership over the army, implements the Party committee system in the army; attaches great importance to political and ideological work, puts forward the call of "political and ideological work goes first," emphasizes the need to strengthen combat and political training in every possible way, further improve military and technical levels; and emphasizes the principle of unity between officers and soldiers, unity between the army and the people, often conducts in-depth anti-imperialist education, requires the Korean People's Army to never relax its vigilance against the U.S. imperialist aggressive plots, resolutely prepares to repel the aggressors at any time, and gloriously performs the task of defending the socialist motherland. General Luo Ruiqing said that we believe that having such a heroic people's army, standing firmly on the eastern frontier of the socialist camp, is our glory and pride.

When General Luo Ruiqing recounted the combat friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, who are as close as lips and teeth, he said that we also saw during the visit that the Korean Workers' Party and the Korean people have a high degree of proletarian internationalist spirit. It should be said that the Korean people's help to our people came earlier and lasted longer. The Chinese people will never forget this sincere fraternal assistance from the Korean people. He said that in the Korean people's war of liberation against U.S. imperialist aggression, the Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the Korean people and army, defeated the U.S. aggressors. In this glorious and great struggle, our friendship has been developed unprecedentedly. The Chinese People's Volunteers have also left an extremely deep friendship among the Korean people.

In his report, General Luo Ruiqing recounted many vivid and touching examples of the friendship between China and Korea that they personally experienced. He said that these examples cannot be fully told for a while. These examples are enough to show that the friendship between the people and armies of China and Korea, cemented with blood, is deeply rooted, flourishing, and evergreen. It will last forever like Changbai Mountain and the Yalu River, and will develop with each passing day as the sun and moon revolve.

General Luo Ruiqing said that our visit not only enhanced the combat friendship between the people and armies of China and Korea, and further consolidated the close unity between our two countries, but also increased our knowledge and learned many useful experiences.

General Luo Ruiqing said that the Korean Workers' Party is a Marxist-Leninist party that has grown and strengthened in battle, a united, broadly mass-based, and combat-capable party. The Korean Workers' Party and its leader, Comrade Kim Il-sung, have a very high prestige among the Korean people. Every call made by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Kim Il-sung is unanimously supported and resolutely implemented by the entire Party and the people of the country. He said that our Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao often teach us that we must respect the Korean Party, the Korean government, the Korean people, and the Korean people's leader at all times. This is a very wise and insightful instruction. We have done this in the past, we are doing this now, and we will definitely do this in the future.

He said that the Korean people have full enthusiasm and a spirit of overcoming difficulties in socialist construction. They have always been a nation known for their hard work, endurance, diligence and courage. After liberation, this fine quality has been further developed in socialist construction. The spirit and enthusiasm of the Korean people are well worth learning from us.

He said that the Korean People's Army's firm determination and confidence in the struggle against U.S. imperialism, their courage to carry out a tenacious and unyielding struggle against the most powerful imperialism in the world, their firm will to refuse to be demobilized and return home until the U.S. imperialists are driven away, their constant vigilance against the possible aggression of imperialism and its lackeys, their infinite confidence in victory, and their most sincere friendship and good wishes for our army are all worthy of our good learning.

General Luo Ruiqing emphasized that the people of China and Korea are peace-loving and opposed to wars of aggression. The governments of our two countries have always made unremitting efforts to strive for world peace and to realize peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. However, U.S. imperialism insists on being an enemy of the people of China and Korea and the people of the world. Although it was forced to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement and admit defeat, it did not learn a lesson from the failure of the war of aggression against Korea. It now not only continues to occupy the southern half of Korea and our country's territory of Taiwan, but also continues to adhere to a policy of aggression and actively prepares to launch a new war of aggression. He said that in the tit-for-tat struggle against U.S. imperialism, the people of China and Korea have the clearest understanding of the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism, its ferocious face, and its seemingly strong but actually weak nature. U.S. imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the people of China and Korea and the people of the world. Opposing the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression and war, and defending peace in the Far East and the world, is the common task of the people of China and Korea and the people of the world.

General Luo Ruiqing said that U.S. imperialism is doing its utmost to pursue its policy of arms expansion and war preparation, attempting to launch local wars and preparing for a full-scale war against the entire socialist camp. However, we should point out that the united efforts of the world socialist camp, the international working class, the national liberation movement, all countries that oppose war, and all peace-loving forces can prevent world war. In the face of the powerful forces of the people of the world defending peace, if the imperialist warmongers dare to ignite the flames of war, then these flames will burn them to ashes.

He said that in order to oppose U.S. imperialist aggression, drive the U.S. aggressor troops out of Taiwan and southern Korea, realize the reunification of our respective motherlands, defend peace in the Far East and the world, and defend our socialist construction, we must further strengthen the unity between the people of our two countries, strengthen the unity between the people of all socialist countries, and strengthen the unity with the peace-loving people of the world. General Luo Ruiqing finally solemnly stated that no matter what the circumstances, the Chinese people will stand with the fraternal Korean people. If the imperialists dare to invade us again, the people of China and Korea will once again join hands, fight side by side, and completely, cleanly, and thoroughly eliminate the invaders. Our cause is just, and final victory must be ours.

During General Luo Ruiqing's report, the entire audience repeatedly burst into enthusiastic applause. The report meeting was presided over by Li Dequan, president of the China-Korea Friendship Association.

Also attending the report meeting were Zhang Xiruo, Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Ji Pengfei, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Director of the General Office of the Ministry of National Defense, Lao She and Wei Chuantong, Vice Presidents of the China-Korea Friendship Association, Xu Zhizhen, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Liu Qingyang, Vice Director of the All-China Women's Federation, Zhang Chao, Vice Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, and Wu Han, Vice Mayor of Beijing.

    新华社11日讯　中国朝鲜友好协会今天下午在人民大会堂举行有首都各界群众一万人参加的报告会，由中国访朝军事友好代表团副团长、国务院副总理、中国人民解放军总参谋长罗瑞卿大将作了代表团访问朝鲜的报告（全文见第四版）。
    罗瑞卿大将在他的长篇报告中，热烈称颂建筑在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的中朝两国人民的友谊。他强调指出，中朝两国人民和军队之间以鲜血凝成的战斗友谊是永世长存的，不论在什么情况下，中国人民都要同兄弟的朝鲜人民站在一起，如果帝国主义胆敢再来侵犯我们，我们中朝两国人民必将再一次携起手来，并肩作战，把侵略者彻底、干净、全部地消灭掉。
    国务院总理周恩来、副总理陈毅元帅，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长彭真、陈叔通，政协全国委员会副主席鲍尔汉，出席了今天的报告会。
    应邀出席报告会的有朝鲜驻中国大使李永镐和大使馆外交官员。
    罗瑞卿大将在报告中生动地描述了代表团访问朝鲜的经过，对朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜人民坚决反对帝国主义，积极建设社会主义和坚决执行国际主义，表示热烈的赞扬，他并且再一次向以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府、朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军，表示衷心的感谢。
    罗瑞卿大将指出，代表团这次访问朝鲜是一次非常愉快，非常满意，而且得益甚多的访问，使我们受到了一次深刻的无产阶级的国际主义教育。
    罗瑞卿大将说，目前朝鲜的形势，在美帝国主义坚持实行侵略政策和战争政策的情况下，仍然处在南北分割的状态。美帝国主义的罪恶目的，就是要把朝鲜南部变成它进行军事冒险的策源地，企图在他们认为适当的时机，重新发动向朝鲜北部的进攻，吞并整个朝鲜，破坏远东与世界的和平。美帝国主义在朝鲜的侵略罪行，证明美帝国主义是朝鲜人民、中国人民以及全世界人民共同的凶恶的敌人。
    他说，我们很兴奋地看到，朝鲜劳动党和政府，坚决地揭露了美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，经常不断地向人民群众进行反对美帝国主义的教育，提高人民的警惕性。同时，朝鲜劳动党和政府，为了实现自己祖国的和平统一，进行了始终一贯的、坚持不懈的斗争，多次提出了和平解决朝鲜问题的合理建议。朝鲜人民从自己的亲身经历中，已经深切地认识到：对帝国主义是不能有丝毫幻想的，只要美国侵略军一天不从朝鲜南部撤走，朝鲜人民的反帝斗争也就一天不会停止的。他说，经过严重考验的朝鲜劳动党和英雄的朝鲜人民，不仅不怕帝国主义，不会被美帝国主义的原子威胁所吓倒，而且，对于美帝国主义企图重新发动侵略战争的阴谋，也是做了充分的准备的，他们有坚定的决心和信心，准备打退美帝国主义的任何挑衅和进犯。
    罗瑞卿大将说，我们相信，在朝鲜人民的坚持不屈的英勇斗争下，在社会主义力量日益强大，帝国主义力量日益衰弱的大好形势下，朝鲜人民的反对帝国主义和争取祖国和平统一的事业，是一定会获得最后胜利的。他说，我们在访问中也看到，朝鲜的战后恢复工作和社会主义建设事业，在短短的几年时间之内，已经取得了惊人的、巨大的成就。朝鲜的工业，经过战后三年的恢复时期，于1957年开始了第一个五年经济建设计划。这个计划的工业产值指标，仅仅用了二年半的时间就提前完成了。今年的工业产值，比1956年增长了二点五倍，比战前的1949年增长了五点四倍，比解放前的1944年增长了六点七倍。农业已经全部实现了合作化，北部的一百万农户组织在三千八百多个合作社里，并基本上实现了水利化和电气化，正在大力为实现机械化而努力。农业提前一年完成了第一个五年计划的粮食生产指标。朝鲜的文化教育事业也比较发达。人民群众的生活水平，也有显著的改善和提高。同时，他还赞扬了朝鲜人民艰苦朴素、勤劳勇敢的优良作风。
    罗瑞卿大将指出，朝鲜的社会主义建设事业能够取得这种巨大成就的原因，主要是以金日成同志为首的劳动党的正确领导，全体朝鲜人民的充沛干劲；同时，各兄弟国家对朝鲜人民的援助，也起到了一定的作用。他说，事实证明：朝鲜劳动党所提出的、高速度建设社会主义的路线是完全正确的。现在，劳动党又提出了人民经济发展的七年计划，七年计划的实现，将使朝鲜成为一个发达的社会主义工业国家。
    罗瑞卿大将说，在访问中，我们高兴地看到了我们最亲密的战友——英雄的朝鲜人民军，在保卫和平、保卫祖国的斗争中，在进一步加强军队建设事业中，都获得了巨大的成就。他说，人民军十分重视党对军队的领导，在军队中实行了党委制；很重视政治思想工作，提出了“政治思想工作先行”的号召，强调要千方百计地加强战斗和政治训练，进一步提高军事技术水平；并强调官兵一致、军民一致的原则，经常进行深入的反帝教育，要求朝鲜人民军一刻也不放松对美帝国主义侵略阴谋的警惕，坚决地准备着在任何时候都能给侵略者以反击，光荣地执行保卫社会主义祖国的任务。罗瑞卿大将说，我们认为，有着这样一支英雄的人民军队、坚定地站在社会主义阵营东方的前哨，这是我们的光荣和骄傲。
    罗瑞卿大将在追述唇齿相依的中朝两国人民的战斗友谊时说，我们在访问中还看到，朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜人民，具有高度的无产阶级国际主义精神。应该说，朝鲜人民对我国人民的帮助更早，时间也更长，对于朝鲜人民的这种真诚的兄弟的援助，我国人民将永志不忘。他说，在朝鲜人民反抗美帝国主义侵略的祖国解放战争中，中国人民志愿军同朝鲜人民和军队一起，打败了美国侵略者。在这个光荣、伟大的斗争中，我们之间的友谊，得到了空前的发展。中国人民志愿军在朝鲜的人民中也留下了极为深厚的友谊。
    罗瑞卿大将在报告中讲述了他们亲身感受到的许多表现中朝友谊的生动感人的事例。他说，这些事例一时是说不完的。这些例子足以说明，中朝两国人民和军队之间以鲜血凝成的友谊，是根深叶茂、万古长青的。它将像长白山和鸭绿江一样，与世永存。并将随着日月的运转而日益发展。
    罗瑞卿大将说，我们的访问，不仅增进了中朝两国人民和军队之间的战斗友谊，进一步巩固了我们两国之间的亲密团结，同时也使我们增加了许多知识和学到了许多有益的经验。
    罗瑞卿大将说，朝鲜劳动党是一个从战斗中成长壮大起来的马列主义的政党，是一个团结的、具有广泛群众性的、具有战斗力的党。朝鲜劳动党和它的领袖金日成同志，在朝鲜人民中有很高的威信，党中央和金日成同志，所提出的每一个号召，都受到全党和全国人民的一致拥护和坚决贯彻。他说，我们党中央和毛主席经常教导我们，任何时候我们都要尊重朝鲜的党、朝鲜的政府、朝鲜的人民和朝鲜人民的领袖，这是非常英明和真知灼见的指示。过去我们是这样做的，现在我们也是这样做的，将来我们也一定还要这样做。
    他说，朝鲜人民在社会主义建设中具有充沛的干劲和克服困难的精神，他们从来就是以刻苦耐劳、勤劳勇敢著称的民族，在获得解放以后，这种优良的品质，在社会主义建设中又得到更高度的发展。朝鲜人民的这种精神和干劲，是十分值得我们学习的。
    他说，朝鲜人民军在反对美帝国主义斗争中的坚强决心和信心，他们敢于和世界上最强大的帝国主义进行顽强不屈的斗争，他们抱着不赶走美帝就不复员回家的坚决意志，他们时刻警惕着帝国主义和它的走狗的可能侵犯，他们对胜利抱有无限的信心，他们对我国军队具有最真诚的友谊和良好的祝愿，这些都是值得我们很好学习的。
    罗瑞卿大将强调指出，我们中朝两国人民是热爱和平、反对侵略战争的，我们两国政府历来为争取世界和平、为实现不同社会制度国家之间的和平共处，作了坚持不懈的努力。但是，美帝国主义坚持同中朝两国人民和全世界人民为敌，它虽然在朝鲜停战协定上被迫签字认输，但并没有从侵朝战争的失败中接受教训，它现在不仅仍然霸占着朝鲜的南半部和我国的领土台湾，而且仍然坚持侵略政策，积极准备发动新的侵略战争。他说，中朝两国人民在同美帝国主义进行针锋相对的斗争中，对美帝国主义的侵略本质、它的凶恶面貌和外强中干，有最清楚的认识。美帝国主义是中朝两国人民和全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，保卫远东和世界和平，是中朝两国人民和全世界人民的共同任务。
    罗瑞卿大将说，美帝国主义正在极力推行它的扩军备战政策，企图发动局部战争，并且准备反对整个社会主义阵营的全面战争。但是，我们应该指出，世界社会主义阵营、国际工人阶级、民族解放运动、所有反对战争的国家以及一切爱好和平力量的联合努力，能够防止世界战争。在世界人民保卫和平的强大力量的面前，如果帝国主义战争狂人胆敢煽起战争的火焰，那么，这个火焰将把他们自己烧得干干净净。
    他说，为了反对美帝国主义侵略，把美国侵略军从台湾、从朝鲜南部赶出去，实现我们各自祖国的统一，保卫远东和世界的和平，保卫我们的社会主义建设事业，必须进一步加强我们两国人民间的团结，加强社会主义各国人民之间的团结，加强同全世界爱好和平人民之间的团结。罗瑞卿大将最后庄严表示，不论在什么情况下，中国人民都要同兄弟的朝鲜人民站在一起，如果帝国主义胆敢再来侵犯我们，我们中朝两国人民必将再一次携起手来，并肩作战，把侵略者彻底、干净、全部地消灭掉。我们的事业是正义的，最后胜利一定是我们的。
    罗瑞卿大将在报告的时候，全场不断地发出一阵又一阵的热烈鼓掌声。报告会由中朝友好协会会长李德全主持。
    出席报告会的，还有对外文委主任张奚若，外交部副部长姬鹏飞，国防部办公厅主任萧向荣中将，中朝友好协会副会长老舍、魏传统，全国总工会副主席许之桢，全国妇联副主任刘清扬，全国青联副主席张超，北京市副市长吴晗等。（附图片）
