Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, December 12th. Workers of the No. 2 Youth Furnace at Benxi Iron and Steel Company Steel Plant, one of the nation's advanced electric furnaces, have broken the old convention that "cross-shift steel" smelting time must be long, reducing the average smelting time for a furnace of steel jointly smelted by two shifts (cross-shift steel) by 15 minutes compared to the past.

Electric furnace steelmaking, like open-hearth or converter steelmaking, has the characteristic of strong production continuity. Therefore, there are always several furnaces of steel smelted during the shift change process each day. In the past, the smelting time of "cross-shift steel" in this factory usually took 15 to 20 minutes longer than the time it took each shift to smelt a furnace of steel independently, and this "inevitably long" phenomenon was considered normal. In October of this year, after the First Steelmaking Workshop of Benxi Steel Plant launched a collaboration competition centered on electric furnaces, the No. 2 electric furnace saw several days of "cross-shift steel" smelting time not only not being extended but even shortened. As soon as this new phenomenon emerged, the Party Branch Secretary, the Communist Youth League Branch Secretary, and others went to the No. 2 furnace to help summarize experience. Their experience consists of three points. First, the earlier shift prepares for the next shift. In the past, some people thought that the experience of preparing for the next shift was good, but it could not be promoted because the current shift's production was very tight, and there was no extra time to prepare for the next shift. The No. 2 Youth Furnace, in response to this problem, carefully calculated the "busy but with leisure" details. Through careful analysis of the operating time of each type of work, they identified the time for preparing for the next shift and established a system for preparing for the next shift. For example, furnace workers use loading time to prepare all steelmaking tools for the next shift; loading workers use the time from finishing loading to tapping to gradually prepare raw materials for the next shift. This enables the incoming shift workers to concentrate on steelmaking as soon as they start work, thus effectively shortening the smelting time of "cross-shift steel" and increasing the mutual solidarity of the shifts.

Second, the practice of having only the shift leader of the previous shift hand over to the shift leader of the next shift was changed to a method of handovers where generals hand over to generals, and soldiers hand over to soldiers. The workers call this method of handover according to work type and specific job a mass line handover method. This allows the next shift workers to take their positions and start operations as soon as they start work, saving the shift leader the time of re-arranging things. In order to make the incoming shift workers fully familiar with the entire furnace's production situation, they also implemented a five to ten minute "small cross-operation" method, that is, the two shifts work together for five to ten minutes until the newly incoming workers are completely comfortable with the operation before the previous shift workers leave their posts.

Third, change the unreasonable evaluation methods and establish a scientific responsibility system for "cross-shift steel". In the past, in competition evaluations, this factory only compared output, not time. On the other hand, it was vaguely stipulated that "cross-shift steel" should be counted as the output of the later shift, which was not conducive to giving play to the enthusiasm of the previous shift workers and affected the smelting time of the next shift. The workers believed that this management system was unreasonable. With the approval of the leadership, the No. 2 electric furnace changed this practice. They not only compared output, but also made smelting time an important indicator for competition evaluation. At the same time, they scientifically stipulated the responsibility system for "cross-shift steel": if it is found that "cross-shift steel" has extended the smelting time, a specific analysis will be conducted to find out the reason; the extended time will be counted as that shift's if it is that shift's responsibility. This further mobilized the enthusiasm of the three shifts, enabling everyone to work together to shorten smelting time.

Now, this experience of the No. 2 furnace has been fully promoted in the Benxi Steel Plant and has achieved remarkable results. The smelting time of "cross-shift steel" in the entire plant has been generally shortened.

    本钢二号青年炉三班工人同心协力闹增产
    “跨班钢”冶炼时间显著缩短
    他们的经验是：上一班利用生产间隙，为下一班作好生产准备；实行按工种、按专职对口交接班和两班“小交叉作业”；改进评比方法，建立科学的责任制度
    新华社本溪12日电　全国先进电炉之一——本溪钢铁公司钢厂二号青年炉职工，破除了“跨班钢”冶炼时间必然长的旧常规，使由两班共同炼一炉钢（跨班钢）的冶炼时间，平均比过去缩短十五分钟。
    电炉炼钢，同平炉或转炉一样，具有生产连续性强的特点，因而每天总有几炉钢是在两班交替过程中炼的。过去，这个厂“跨班钢”的冶炼时间通常都比每班独自冶炼一炉钢的时间多用十五分到二十分钟，而且这种“必然长”的现象已被人们认为是正常的现象。今年10月，本钢钢厂第一炼钢车间开展以电炉为中心的协作赛以后，二号电炉出现了一连几天“跨班钢”冶炼时间没有延长甚至还缩短了的事迹。这一新事物一露苗头，党总支书记、团总支书记等人就深入到二号炉，帮助总结经验。他们的经验有三条。第一，上班为下班做好生产准备。过去，有的人认为给下班做好生产准备的经验好是好，但不能推广。因为本班生产很紧，没有多余时间为下一班做好生产准备。二号青年炉针对这个问题，算了“忙中有闲”的细账。通过仔细地分析各工种的作业时间，找出了为下一班作准备工作的时间，并建立了为下班做好生产准备的制度。如，炉前工人利用装料时间，为下班准备好一切炼钢工具；装料工人利用从装完料到出炉这一段时间，陆续地为下班准备好原料材料。这样就使接班工人一上班就集中精力去炼钢，因而有效地缩短了“跨班钢”的冶炼时间，并增进了各班工人互相的团结。
    第二，把过去只由上班班长向下班班长交班的作法，改为将对将，兵对兵的交接班的方法。职工们把这种按工种，按专职对口交接班，称为群众路线的交接班方法。这样下一班工人一上班就各守岗位进行操作，省去了班长重新布置的时间。为了使接班工人充分熟悉全炉的生产情况，他们还实行了五分钟到十分钟的“小交叉作业”的办法，即两班工人共同操作五分钟到十分钟，直到新接班工人完全操作自如后，上班工人才离开岗位。
    第三，改变不合理的评比方法，建立科学的“跨班钢”责任制度。这个厂过去在竞赛评比中，只比产量，不比时间。另方面，又笼统地规定“跨班钢”算作后一个班的产量，因此不利于发挥上班工人的积极性，影响下一班的冶炼时间。职工们认为这种管理制度是不合理的。经过领导批准，二号电炉改变了这种作法。他们不仅比产量，而且也把冶炼时间做为竞赛评比的重要指标。同时科学地规定了“跨班钢”的责任制：如果发现“跨班钢，延长了冶炼时间，就进行具体分析”找出原因，属于那个班的责任，延长的时间就算是那个班的。这样就进一步调动了三个班的积极性，使大家同心协力缩短冶炼时间。
    现在，二号炉的这个经验已在本钢钢厂全面推广，并收到了显著效果。全厂“跨班钢”的冶炼时间已普遍缩短。
