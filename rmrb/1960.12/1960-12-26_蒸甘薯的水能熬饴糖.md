The public canteens and collective mess units in the Berlin District of Jiangjin County, Sichuan Province, are widely using the water from steaming sweet potatoes to make maltose syrup. This kind of maltose syrup is very sweet, and the production method is simple, so it can be promoted in all canteens that steam sweet potatoes for consumption. After all public canteens in the Fuxing Commune of this district implemented this method, they have produced more than 25,000 jin of maltose syrup since the autumn consumption of sweet potatoes began. In addition to the canteens and commune members using it themselves, they have also sold part of it to the supply and marketing departments.

This method of making maltose syrup without using grain was summarized and promoted by the Berlin District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party based on the experience of the masses. According to the experience of the Berlin District, the method of making sweet potato maltose syrup is: put the sweet potatoes used by the canteen for each meal into a steamer with a steamer mat. After the sweet potatoes are steamed and taken out, the water at the bottom of the steamer remains in the pot. Continue to steam five to six times to increase the sugar content in the water at the bottom of the steamer. Then, filter out the impurities and put it back into the pot to boil, with the heat being high first and then low. If some germinated grain or malt water is added before boiling to saccharify it, the quality of the syrup will be even better.

    蒸甘薯的水能熬饴糖
    四川江津县柏林区各公共食堂和集体伙食单位，普遍利用蒸红苕（甘薯）的甑脚水熬制饴糖。这种饴糖，味道很甜，制作方法也简单，凡蒸吃红苕的食堂都能推广。这个区的复兴公社各公共食堂全部推行这个办法后，自秋季食用红苕以来，已熬制饴糖二万五千多斤，除食堂和社员自用以外，还出售了部分给供销部门。
    这个不用粮食熬制饴糖的办法，是中共柏林区委根据群众的经验加以总结和推广的。根据柏林区的经验，熬制红苕饴糖的办法是：把食堂每顿吃用的红苕放入置有甑篾的甑内，红苕蒸熟取出后，甑脚水仍留在锅内，连续蒸五至六次，使甑脚水内糖分加浓，然后滤去杂质，再放进锅里熬，火势先大后小。在熬前如果放入一些谷芽或麦芽水，使之发酵糖化，糖质就更好。
