    Reporting from this newspaper: Party committees at all levels in Yushu County, Jilin Province, are focusing on weak links, strengthening leadership over backward management areas and production teams, and widely organizing advanced teams and backward teams to carry out linked, mutually supportive competitions, enabling a large number of third-category management areas and third-category production teams to rapidly upgrade.
    This spring, the Yushu County Party committees at all levels, through various forms, clarified and analyzed the situation of third-category management areas and production teams. They believed that these management areas and production teams were backward for various reasons. However, the common reason was weak leadership, a lack of backbone forces, and the failure to quickly and correctly implement the Party's policies. Therefore, the entire county first strengthened leadership over the backward management areas and production teams. Starting in the spring of this year, a batch of cadres were successively sent to third-category management areas to serve in leadership positions. In the summer, the county sent another 3,466 cadres to concurrently serve as deputy leaders of production teams, including secretaries of the county Party committee secretariat, secretaries of commune Party committees, and secretaries of management area branches. Party committees at all levels also paid attention to establishing Party and League organizations and developing Party and League members in weak areas, and paid attention to cultivating five-good cadres and five-good commune members. Now, most of the production teams have established Party and League branches or groups, and almost all production teams have Party and League members. Due to the adoption of these measures, the third-category management areas and production teams have strengthened their leadership forces, forming a strong leadership core, and creating favorable conditions for rapidly changing their backward status. For example, among the 78 production teams in the Xinzhuang People's Commune, there were originally ten third-category production teams with only 20 Party members. After the commune Party committee sent 13 cadres, equivalent to deputy secretaries of management area branches, to concurrently serve as deputy leaders, over the past year, the number of Party members in the third-category teams has increased to 44, 173 activists have been cultivated, eight teams have established Party branches, ten branch secretaries have been appointed, and 36 five-good cadres and 169 five-good commune members have emerged.
    In the process of helping backward management areas and production teams rapidly upgrade, Yushu County also paid attention to using the method of mobilizing the masses to help and learn from each other to encourage cadres and commune members of backward teams to catch up with the advanced. Since the summer hoeing, the county has developed the competition between teams into a linked, mutually supportive competition between advanced teams and backward teams. This type of competition has played a significant role in helping backward teams upgrade.
    First, it enabled cadres and commune members of backward teams to establish ambitious goals for catching up with the advanced. For example, teams six and seven of the Fuan Management Area of the Fuan Commune were adjacent to each other, with similar land, population, labor, and tools. However, due to different subjective efforts, production has varied greatly over the years, with team seven harvesting more than 100,000 jin of grain more than team six each year. After Comrade Pei Huanzhen, the secretary of the management area branch, concurrently served as the deputy leader of team six, he encouraged the commune members to compete with team seven. On the second day of the competition, more than 180 people from team six went out to accumulate manure and deliver fertilizer, increasing the fertilizer application per hectare from 18 tons to 30 tons. Second, advanced teams introduced advanced experiences to backward teams. For example, since the advanced team three and the backward team four of the Shuangjingzi Commune launched a linked, mutually supportive competition, Wang Dianchen, the leader of team three, often participated in the team committee of team four to introduce the experience of team three in leading production. According to the experience introduced by team three, and based on the specific circumstances of their team, team four rationally adjusted the labor force, organizing men and women separately, matching strengths and weaknesses, and selecting a quality inspector for each group. As a result, the work progressed quickly and the quality was good. When harvesting crops, team three first had skilled workers cut two ridges as an example, organized everyone to visit and discuss how to ensure quality, and then started harvesting, so the quality of the cutting was good; when pinching sorghum, sacks were laid underneath so that no sorghum grains were wasted. When Wang Dianchen saw that team four was not doing this, and the quality was not as good as team three, he took the initiative to introduce these experiences to the leader of team four during the rest periods. When pulling the land, team four used sugar beet boxes to pull corn, which could hold more, and the leader of team four promptly introduced this experience to team three. The two teams helped and encouraged each other, and production was very good. When evaluating after the summer hoeing, team four was rated first in the entire management area, and team three was rated second; during the autumn harvest, team three rose to first place, and team four was second.

Because he handled everything in accordance with the Party's policies, humbly learned from basic-level cadres, and adhered to the "Four Togethers," this originally backward team has become an advanced team. This is him publicizing the Party's policies to the masses. (Photo by Wang Xinzhu, reporter of Xinhua News Agency)

    充实基层干部　建立党团组织　开展携手竞赛
    榆树各级党组织加强后进单位领导
    大批三类管理区和生产队升级，推动生产持续跃进
    本报讯　吉林省榆树县各级党委，大抓薄弱环节，加强对后进管理区和生产队的领导，并且广泛组织先进队和后进队开展有赛有帮的挂钩携手赛，使大批三类管理区和三类生产队迅速升级。
    今年春天，榆树县各级党委通过各种形式摸清和分析了三类管理区、生产队的情况，认为这些管理区和生产队之所以落后，是有各种原因的。但是，共同的原因是领导弱，缺少骨干力量，党的政策在这里不能迅速地、正确地贯彻。因此，全县首先对后进的管理区和生产队加强了领导。从今年春季开始，陆续下放一批干部到三类管理区担任领导职务。夏季，全县又派了三千四百六十六名干部兼任生产队副队长。其中有县委书记处书记，公社党委书记，管理区支部书记等。各级党委还注意在薄弱地区建立党、团组织和发展党、团员，注意培养五好干部和五好社员。现在，绝大部分生产队都建立了党、团支部或小组，几乎所有的生产队都有了党、团员。由于采取了这些措施，使三类管理区、生产队加强了领导力量，形成坚强的领导核心，为迅速改变后进面貌创造了有利条件。比如新庄人民公社的七十八个生产队中，原来有十个三类生产队，只有二十名党员。公社党委派了十三个相当于管理区支部副书记的干部，到这里兼任副队长后，一年来，三类队的党员发展到四十四名，培养了一百七十三名积极分子，有八个队建立了党支部，配备了十名支部书记，涌现出三十六名五好干部，一百六十九名五好社员。
    榆树县在帮助后进管理区和生产队迅速升级的过程中，还注意运用发动群众互帮互学的方法，来鼓励后进队的干部和社员赶先进。从今年夏锄以来，全县把队与队之间的竞赛，发展成先进队与后进队挂钩的携手赛。这种竞赛对帮助后进队升级作用很大。
    第一，使后进队的干部和社员，树立了赶先进的雄心壮志。比如福安公社福安管理区六队和七队地挨地，土地、人口、劳力、工具都差不多，但由于主观努力不同，几年来生产相差很大，七队每年都比六队多收十多万斤粮食。管理区支部书记裴焕珍同志到六队兼任副队长以后，就鼓励社员和七队竞赛。开展竞赛的第二天，六队就出动了一百八十多人积肥送粪，每公顷土地施肥量由历年的十八吨提高到三十吨。第二，先进队向后进队介绍先进经验。比如双井子公社先进的三队和后进的四队开展挂钩携手赛以来，三队队长王殿臣经常参加四队的队委会，介绍三队领导生产的经验。四队按三队介绍的经验，又根据本队具体情况，合理调整劳动力，男女分别编组，搭配强弱，各组都选出一名质量检查员。结果工作进度很快，质量也好。开始割庄稼时，三队先由好手割两垅作样子，组织大家参观，讨论如何保证质量，然后再开镰，因此割的质量好；掐高粱时，下面铺麻袋，掉下的高粱粒一点也不糟踏。王殿臣看四队没这样作，质量不如三队好，就在休息的时候，主动向四队队长介绍这些经验。在拉地时，四队用甜菜箱子拉玉米，装得多，四队队长及时把这一经验介绍给三队。两个队互相帮助、互相鼓舞，生产都搞得很好。夏锄结束后评比的时候，四队在全管理区评为第一，三队评为第二；秋收时三队上升为第一，四队第二。（附图片）
