Xinhua News Agency, December 21st dispatch from New York: New York's *Worker's Weekly* published an editorial on December 18th entitled "A Call to Struggle for Peace," supporting the statement of the Moscow meeting of eighty-one Communist and Workers' Parties.

The editorial pointed out that the statement affirms the correct conclusions made in the 1957 Moscow Declaration and the Peace Manifesto regarding the issues of war and peace. The editorial wrote, "The statement says that 'the united efforts of the world socialist camp, the international working class, the national liberation movement, all countries opposing war, and all peace-loving forces can prevent' a world war.

"The world's Communists, based on current reality, conclude that war is not inevitable. But they do not diminish the danger of war."

The editorial emphasized that "the main emphasis is on struggle. Struggle will determine this issue. In this regard, the peace movement is called 'the broadest movement of our time,' a movement including people 'with different political and religious beliefs, belonging to different social classes.' But this view of the vast potential of the peace movement does not in any way diminish the enormous responsibility borne by the working class, especially the Communists, in the struggle for peace."

The editorial said that the American people have a special responsibility in the struggle for peace, "because, as the world's Communists have concluded—American imperialism is 'the main fortress of world reaction…the main fortress of colonialism' and 'the main force of aggression and war.' This can be seen in the arming of Adenauer and former Hitler generals with atomic weapons, the continued rule of the Franco fascist regime in Spain, intervention in Cuba, or support for the traitors of the Congo. It is clear that all these policies are against the interests of our people and endanger peace."

*Worker's Weekly* called on the American people, especially the American working class, to unite and fight against the reactionary policies of the American government and to defend peace.

Xinhua News Agency, December 21st dispatch: The Canadian Communist Party's organ *The Tribune* published an editorial on the 19th entitled "A Call to Action" on the letter from the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries to the people of the world.

The editorial said: This is the voice of the Communist parties and Communists of all countries united together, "their unity is unbreakable, and they are the most influential political force of our time. They call for greater and more concerted efforts for peace, and people from all walks of life will hear and heed this call."

The editorial pointed out that even in politically backward North America, more and more people are abandoning the malicious slanders of so-called "Communist aggression" that the enemies of peace are still clamoring about. Many who once blindly believed that the socialist countries were the main threat to peace are now gradually realizing that this threat actually comes from American imperialism.

The editorial concluded by expressing confidence that the Canadian people, who have consistently upheld peace, will be inspired by the letter to the people of the world, thereby greatly strengthening their efforts.

Xinhua News Agency, Santiago: The Chilean Communist Party organ *El Siglo* published an editorial on the 7th on the statement of the Moscow meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries, saying that this "statement reaffirms the unbreakable unity of the socialist countries, reaffirms the ideological, tactical, and strategic unity of the parties of all countries as the vanguard of the international proletariat, regardless of whether these parties are struggling to overthrow the oppression of imperialism, or have already defeated the oppression of imperialism and are building the road to a communist society without classes, without oppressors and oppressed."

The editorial emphasized that "the position on peace reaffirmed by the international workers' movement is completely in line with the needs and hopes of the people of all countries in the world. The Soviet Union, China, the people's democracies, and all the people in the so-called Western world who are fighting for liberation clearly know that in the peaceful competition between capitalism and socialism, it is clear that socialism will win."

The editorial said, "This meeting shows that the friendship and brotherhood of the socialist countries are becoming more and more dynamic."

The editorial quoted Chairman Liu Shaoqi's remarks that the results of the meeting have further strengthened the unity of the entire communist movement and strengthened the unity between the Chinese and Soviet parties and countries.

    兄弟党报纸评各国共产党和工人党代表会议声明
    美国《工人周报》
    据新华社21日讯　纽约消息：纽约《工人周报》12月18日发表了题为《为和平而斗争的号召》的社论，支持八十一个共产党和工人党莫斯科会议的声明。
    社论指出，声明确认1957年莫斯科宣言及和平宣言关于战争与和平问题所作的正确论断。社论写道，“声明说，‘世界社会主义阵营、国际工人阶级、民族解放运动、所有反对战争的国家以及一切爱好和平力量的联合努力能够防止’世界战争。
    “世界共产党人以当前现实为基础得出结论说，战争不是不可避免的。但是他们并不缩小战争的危险。”
    社论强调说，“主要的着重点是在斗争上。斗争将决定这个问题。在这方面，和平运动被称为‘当代最广泛的运动’，是包括‘具有不同政治信仰和宗教信仰，属于不同社会阶级’的人们的运动。但是，这种对和平运动广大潜力的看法丝毫也不缩小工人阶级，特别是共产党人在争取和平的斗争中所担负的巨大责任。”
    社论说，美国人民在争取和平的斗争中负有特别的责任，“因为正如世界共产党人所下的结论——美国帝国主义是‘世界反动势力的主要堡垒……殖民主义的主要堡垒’和‘侵略和战争的主要力量。’这可以从用原子武器武装阿登纳和前希特勒将领、使佛朗哥法西斯政权继续在西班牙当权、干涉古巴或支持刚果的卖国贼等方面看出来。很明显，所有这些政策都是违反我国人民的利益，危及和平的。”
    《工人周报》号召美国人民、特别是美国工人阶级，团结起来为反对美国政府的反动政策和保卫和平而斗争。
    加拿大《论坛报》
    新华社21日讯　加拿大共产党机关报《论坛报》19日以《行动的号召》为题，就各国共产党和工人党代表会议告世界人民书发表社论。
    社论说：这是团结在一起的各国共产党和共产党人的呼声，“他们的团结是牢不可破的，他们是我们时代最有影响的政治力量。他们号召为和平作出更大的和更联合一致的努力，各地各阶层的人民将会听到并注意这个号召。”
    社论指出，即使是在政治上落后的北美，也有越来越多的人摈弃和平的敌人仍然在叫嚷的所谓“共产党侵略”的恶毒的诽谤。曾经盲目地认为社会主义国家是和平主要威胁的很多人现在逐渐认识到，这种威胁实际上来自美帝国主义。
    社论最后表示相信，一贯维护和平的加拿大人民将从告世界人民书得到鼓舞，从而大大地加强他们的努力。
    智利《世纪报》
    新华社圣地亚哥电　智利共产党机关报《世纪报》7日就各国共产党和工人党莫斯科代表会议的声明发表社论说，这个“声明重申了社会主义各国牢不可破的团结，重申了作为国际无产阶级先锋队的各国党在思想、战术和战略上的一致，不管这些党是正在为推翻帝国主义的压迫而斗争，还是已经击溃了帝国主义的压迫，正在建设通向没有阶级、没有压迫者和被压迫者的共产主义社会的道路。”
    社论强调说，“国际工人运动重申的和平立场完全符合于世界各国人民的需要和希望。苏联、中国、各人民民主国家和所谓西方世界的一切为争取解放而斗争的人民清楚地知道，在资本主义和社会主义的和平竞赛中，显然社会主义将取得胜利。”
    社论说，“这次会议表明，社会主义各国的友谊和兄弟之情越来越富有活力。”
    社论引用了刘少奇主席关于会议的结果更加加强了整个共产主义运动的团结，加强了中苏两党、两国之间的团结的讲话。
