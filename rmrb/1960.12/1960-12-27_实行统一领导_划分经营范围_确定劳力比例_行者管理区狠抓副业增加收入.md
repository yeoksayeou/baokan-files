    Implement Unified Leadership, Divide Business Scope, Determine Labor Ratio
    Xingzhe Management Area Vigorously Develops Sideline Production to Increase Income
    Total income of fifteen reduced production teams reaches the level of normal or surplus production teams.

    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an: The five production teams of the Xingzhe Management Area of the Huaqing People's Commune in Lintong County, Shaanxi Province, have adopted a combination of collective and individual management methods to actively develop winter sideline production.

    These five production teams suffered from two hundred-day droughts in spring and summer this year, followed by autumn rain and flooding, resulting in agricultural losses. Among the forty-three sub-teams, twenty-four had surplus production, four had normal production, and fifteen had reduced production. In response to this situation, after the autumn harvest and planting were basically completed, these five production teams, in accordance with the commune's policy of compensating for agricultural losses with sideline production, convened meetings of sub-team cadres to study and formulate sideline production plans. During the discussion and formulation of the plans, production team and sub-team cadres mobilized the commune members to come up with ideas, and consulted with experienced farmers and sideline production experts, identifying seventeen major sideline avenues and dozens of minor ones.

    The production teams and sub-teams jointly studied the supply and repair of required raw materials and tools, labor arrangements, and product sales, and implemented unified leadership, decentralized operations, and rational division of the business scope among production teams, sub-teams, and individual commune members. Projects with larger scales and requiring certain equipment or raw materials, such as cottonseed oil extraction, cotton processing, iron and woodworking, reed weaving, and short-distance transportation, were managed by the production teams. Activities such as nailing pots, sewing shoes, repairing small agricultural tools, and cutting thorn branches for weaving baskets were managed by the sub-teams. For some other projects, such as weaving bamboo cages and baskets, the production teams were responsible for supplying raw materials and selling finished products for the sub-teams to process, or several sub-teams could cooperate on a voluntary basis, with income distributed according to the labor and raw materials provided by each sub-team.

    In addition, small-scale sideline activities such as braiding straw hat braids, peeling cotton stalks, bundling brooms, and catching shrimp, or sporadic work in collective projects, were undertaken by commune members' families, or the sub-teams supplied raw materials for commune members to process, with the production income belonging to the commune members themselves.

    To effectively ensure that there was sufficient strong labor for managing overwintering crops, the proportion of labor allocated to sideline businesses operated by the production teams was determined, requiring full utilization of auxiliary and semi-labor. At the same time, the production teams also properly arranged the commune members' time for rest, study, entertainment, and household chores, implementing a combination of work and rest.

    Currently, collective sideline businesses such as reed mat factories, iron and woodworking groups, cotton ginning factories, and oil mills in the production teams and sub-teams have all started production. The four production teams of Xianfeng, Xingfeng, Shui Liu, and Cangtou have also collaborated to form a transportation team using their rubber-wheeled carts and frame carts to undertake short-distance transportation, transporting more than 900 tons of coal to the Tongchuan mining area and hauling 2,700 large carts of urban fertilizer. The hauling of urban fertilizer alone can save nearly 3,000 yuan in production costs.

    The system of evaluating work points and rewarding over-fulfillment has been implemented in all sideline production. In the Cangtou Production Team's reed mat factory, fourteen mat weaving workers engaged in competition, and within three days of starting work, they had generally exceeded the quota of weaving one mat per work shift. In the Xianfeng Production Team's iron and woodworking group, in early December, three blacksmiths used local steel and iron to make nearly one hundred pieces of hoes, shovels, adzes, sickles, and ladles, generating an income of more than 200 yuan. The production teams have also taken various measures to actively support the sub-teams in developing sideline businesses. For example, the loading and unloading team organized by the sub-teams under the Shui Liu Production Team has loaded and unloaded more than 90 tons of goods for the Lintong Railway Station.

    While doing a good job in collective sideline production, the production teams and sub-teams are also actively organizing commune members to engage in household sideline production. The Xianfeng Team sold more than 3,000 jin of wheat straw to commune members for braiding straw hat braids. The Xingzhe Management Area also held a technical training conference in the Ma'e Commune, which is famous for straw hat braids, to train several technicians for each sub-team and widely impart the technique of braiding straw hat braids. The Xihe Sub-team also organized women and children to peel cotton stalk fibers, planning to peel 10,000 jin, and now the entire team can collect 200 to 300 jin of cotton stalk bark every day.

    Due to the increase in sideline income, the total income of ten reduced production sub-teams in the management area has reached the level of surplus or normal production teams. The relevant production teams are now actively trying to help the remaining five reduced production sub-teams further develop sideline production in an effort to reach their original income level.

    实行统一领导　划分经营范围　确定劳力比例
    行者管理区狠抓副业增加收入
    十五个减产小队有十个队的总收入达到平收队或超产队水平
    据新华社西安讯　陕西省临潼县华清人民公社行者管理区的五个生产队，采取集体经营与个人经营相结合的办法，积极开展冬季副业生产。
    这五个生产队今年连遭春夏两个百日大旱和后秋雨涝，农业歉收。四十三个小队中有二十四个超产，四个平收，十五个减产。针对这种情况，在秋收秋播基本结束后，这五个生产队按照公社提出的农业减产副业补的方针，召集小队干部研究制定副业生产计划。在讨论制定计划的过程中，生产队和小队的干部深入发动社员想办法，并同老农和副业生产能手商量，找到副业门路大宗的有十七项，零碎的有几十种。
    生产队和小队共同研究所需原料、工具的供应修配、劳力安排和产品销售等问题，并实行统一领导，分散经营，合理划分了生产队、小队和社员个人的经营范围。像棉籽榨油、棉花加工、铁木业、芦苇编织和短途运输等规模较大、需要一定设备或原料的项目，由生产队经营；钉锅、绡鞋、修补小型农具、砍荆条编筐等由小队经营；还有一些项目如编竹笼、竹筐等由生产队负责供应原料、销售成品交小队加工，或由几个小队根据自愿原则协作经营，收入按各小队所出的劳力和原料进行分红。
    此外如编草帽辫、剥棉秆皮、缚条帚、捞虾等小型副业或集体经营项目中的零星活由社员家庭来搞，或小队供应原料由社员加工，生产收入归社员自己。
    为切实保证管理越冬作物有足够的精壮劳力，决定了生产队经营的副业所占用的劳力的比例，要求充分利用辅助劳力和半劳力。与此同时，各生产队还妥善安排了社员休息、学习、娱乐和处理家务的时间，实行劳逸结合。
    现在各生产队和小队的集体副业如芦席厂、铁木业组、弹花厂、油坊等，均已开工生产。先锋、行丰、水刘、苍头等四个生产队还以自己的胶轮大车和架子车协作组成运输组承担短途运输，已给铜川矿区运了九百多吨煤炭，并拉城肥二千七百大车，仅拉城肥一项，即可节省生产费用近三千元。
    在全部副业生产中，实行了评工记分超额奖励制度，苍头生产队芦席厂，十四个编席工人展开竞赛，开工后三天就普遍打破了每工编织一张席的定额。先锋生产队铁木业组12月上旬三个铁匠就用土钢土铁打制锄、铣、镢头、镰、杓子等近一百件，收入二百多元。各生产队并采取了多种措施，积极扶持小队搞副业。如水刘生产队组织所属各小队协作组成的装卸队，已为临潼火车站装卸货物九十多吨。
    生产队和小队在搞好集体副业的同时，并积极组织社员们搞家庭副业。先锋队卖给社员麦秆三千多斤，由社员来编草帽辫，行者管理区并在以出草帽辫著名的马额公社开了技术传授会议，为每个小队训练了几个技术员，普遍传授了编草帽辫的技术。西河小队还组织妇女儿童剥棉秆纤维，计划剥一万斤，现在全队每天都可收到二、三百斤棉秆皮。
    由于副业收入的增加，管理区有十个减产生产小队的总收入，达到了超产或平收队的水平。有关生产队现正积极设法帮助其余的五个减产小队进一步开展副业生产，力争达到原定的收入水平。
