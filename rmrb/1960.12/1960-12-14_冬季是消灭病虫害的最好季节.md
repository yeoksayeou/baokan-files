Winter is the Best Season to Eliminate Pests and Diseases
Commentator of this newspaper

    To strive for a great harvest next year, we must first strive for a better summer harvest. To achieve the goal of a great summer harvest, we must do a good job in field management of overwintering crops in all aspects.
    Eliminating pests and diseases is an important task in managing winter crops well.
    Winter is the most favorable season to eliminate pests and diseases. Some pests and diseases breed and develop on winter crops, but in small numbers and limited areas, making it easier to eradicate them. Other pests and diseases are dormant overwinter, not eating or moving, and their hiding places are relatively concentrated, making it easier to capture and eliminate them. Eliminating one insect in winter, preventing it from continuing to breed and develop, is equivalent to eliminating millions of insects in summer and autumn. Preventing pests and diseases in winter requires less effort but yields greater results, achieving twice the result with half the effort. At the same time, agricultural work is relatively idle in winter, and labor is easier to arrange. By eradicating many pests and diseases in winter, we can greatly reduce the labor tension caused by spending more manpower on preventing pests and diseases during the busy summer and autumn seasons. Therefore, seizing the winter to eliminate pests and diseases is not only a good strategy for fighting pests and diseases, but also a good way to take the initiative in agricultural production, plan the use of labor in a planned way, and adjust between busy and idle periods.
    Eliminating pests and diseases is an important aspect of fighting natural disasters. We must "know ourselves and know our enemy" in order to prescribe the right medicine and strive for complete victory. All localities should go deep into the fields to investigate the development of insect pests, mobilize the masses in a timely manner, organize forces, and adopt the method of dedicated personnel taking specific responsibility for specific areas to carry out thorough eradication. After discovering wheat stem fly damage, the Bafu Production Team of Chengguan Commune in Pucheng County, Shaanxi Province, under the personal command of the county party secretary and the production team leader, organized fifty laborers and spent one day eliminating the pests in more than ninety mu of wheat fields, stopping the development of the wheat stem fly. In another wheat field, because fewer pests were initially discovered, the masses believed that "small fish cannot make big waves, and a few pests are not important before the big freeze," and did not take action to prevent them early. As a result, the area of damage expanded from sixty mu to one thousand five hundred mu in ten days. To treat it at this point requires twenty to thirty times more manpower and medicine.
    We must plan and prevent pests and diseases such as rice borers and corn borers that are overwintering, and eradicate the root of the problem as early as possible. These overwintering pests and diseases are generally hidden in crop stalks and field weeds. In conjunction with winter production activities such as accumulating and composting fertilizer, collecting fuel and feed, plowing land, and cleaning up fields, we can systematically collect crop stalks, stubble, and field weeds that harbor pests, and carry out appropriate treatment to eliminate pests, achieving two goals at once. Chengnan Commune in Yizhang County, Hunan Province, adopted several different methods to eliminate rice borers hidden in rice stubble, based on the pupation and emergence patterns of rice borers: For some winter-planted fields and some fields that cannot be flooded and plowed before the emergence of borers in March next year, all rice seedlings were pulled out and used for composting fertilizer; for other fields that can be flooded and plowed in winter or before the emergence of borers in spring, the rice seedlings were trampled into the water in conjunction with plowing to kill the borers. The Jiangpotou Production Team of Chengnan Commune used these methods to eliminate borers, using an average of only 0.3 workdays per mu; the Pailou Shui Production Team used the method of pulling rice seedlings to eliminate borers in all types of rice fields, requiring an average of nearly one workday per mu, which is twice as much labor as the former method. From this, it can be seen that preventing pests and diseases requires not only grasping the favorable opportunity to treat them early according to the development patterns of pests and diseases, but also combining with winter production and adopting various clever methods to achieve twice the result with half the effort.

    冬季是消灭病虫害的最好季节
    本报评论员
    争取明年大丰收，首先要争取明年有一个更好的夏收。要达到夏季大丰收的目的，就要从各方面作好越冬作物的田间管理。
    消灭病虫害是管好冬作物的一项重要工作。
    冬季是消灭病虫害最为有利的季节。有些病虫，在冬作物上繁殖发展，数量少，范围小，扑灭起来比较容易；有些病虫则在潜伏越冬，不食不动，躲藏的地方比较集中，也便于捕杀消灭。冬季消灭了一条虫，使其不能继续繁殖发展，就等于为明年夏秋消灭了上百万条虫。冬季防治病虫害费力小，收效大，事半功倍。同时，冬季农活较闲，劳力也好安排。在冬季把许多病虫害根除了，就可以大大减少在夏秋大忙时，由于花费更多的人力防治病虫害所造成的劳力紧张。所以，抓紧冬季消灭病虫害，不但是和病虫害作斗争的良策，同时也是农业生产上争取主动，有计划地安排使用劳力，调剂忙闲的一个好办法。
    消灭病虫害是同自然灾害作斗争的一个重要方面，必须“知己知彼”才能对症下药，争取全胜。各地要深入田间，查清虫害发展情况，及时动员群众，组织力量，采用专人专责、分片包干的办法，进行彻底根治。陕西蒲城县城关公社八福生产队，在发现麦秆蝇危害后，由县委书记和生产队长亲自挂帅，组织五十名劳力，一天时间，就在九十多亩麦田里消灭了虫害，制止了麦秆蝇的发展。而在另一处麦田里，开始由于发现虫害较少，群众认为“小鱼翻不了大浪，大冻前有几个虫害也不要紧”，没有及早动手防治，结果，十天之后，危害面积就由六十亩发展到一千五百亩。这时再治，就要多用二三十倍的人力和药剂。
    对稻螟虫、玉米螟虫等正在潜伏越冬的病虫害，要有计划地进行防治，及早铲除祸根。这类越冬病虫，一般都潜藏在农作物的秆秸和田间杂草里，可以结合积肥沤肥、收集燃料、饲料、翻耕土地和清洁田园等冬季生产活动，有计划地把寄藏虫害的作物秆秸根茬和田间杂草搜集起来，分别进行适当的处理，消灭虫害，作到一举两得。湖南省宜章县城南公社，根据水稻螟虫的蛹化、羽化规律，对消灭寄藏在水稻根茬里的螟虫，分别采取了几种不同的办法：对一部分冬种田和一部分到明年三月螟虫羽化以前不能浸水翻耕的田，就全部拔掉禾蔸，沤制肥料；对另一部分在冬季或春季螟虫羽化以前可以进行浸水翻耕的田，则结合翻田，把禾蔸踩在水里，杀死螟虫。城南公社江坡头生产队用这些办法消灭螟虫，平均每亩田只用零点三个工；排楼水生产队则不论哪种稻田，一律用拔禾蔸的办法灭螟虫，平均每亩田就需用近一个工，较前一种办法多用两倍的劳力。由此可见，防治病虫害不但要根据病虫的发展规律，抓住有利时机早治；还要结合冬季生产，采用多种办法巧治，才能更好地达到事半功倍的效果。
