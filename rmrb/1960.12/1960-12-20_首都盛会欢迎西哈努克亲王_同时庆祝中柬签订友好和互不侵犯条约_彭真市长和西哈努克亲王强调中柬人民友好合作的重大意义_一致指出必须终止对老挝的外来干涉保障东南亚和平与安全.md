Xinhua News Agency, 19th December: More than 10,000 people from all walks of life in the capital held a grand meeting at the Great Hall of the People this afternoon, warmly welcoming Cambodian Head of State Prince Norodom Sihanouk and celebrating the solemn signing of the Sino-Cambodian Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression by the two governments today.

Today's grand gathering demonstrated that the friendly relations between China and Cambodia have entered a new stage, and the signing of the Sino-Cambodian Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression has become a major joyous event in the political life of the two peoples. When the news of the signing of the treaty by the two governments this afternoon was announced at the meeting, prolonged thunderous applause erupted in the hall.

The Great Hall of the People was filled with jubilation. The rostrum was decorated with colorful flowers. In the center of the rostrum, the huge national flags of China and Cambodia were hung side by side, connected at the bottom and topped with a large cluster of bright flowers, symbolizing that the friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian people has blossomed more and more brilliantly. The hall was also hung with huge banners written in both Chinese and Cambodian: "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian people!" "Long live world peace!"

At 4:10 PM, Prince Sihanouk and his wife, as well as Cambodian Vice-Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Throne, Penn Nouth, Prime Minister Phou Proeung, First Deputy Prime Minister Nhiek Tioulong, and other distinguished guests, accompanied by Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Vice-Chairman Dong Biwu, Chairman Zhu De, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice-Premier Chen Yi, Mayor of Beijing Peng Zhen, and other leaders, ascended the rostrum. At this moment, the entire audience of ten thousand people stood up and burst into thunderous applause.

Distinguished guests who also ascended the rostrum with them included Prince Sihanouk's princesses and princes, some high-ranking Cambodian officials, and Cambodian Ambassador to China, Leng Ngeth. Children from the capital presented flowers to Prince Sihanouk and all the Cambodian distinguished guests.

After the start of the meeting, the band played the national anthems of Cambodia and China.

Mayor Peng Zhen delivered an enthusiastic speech at the meeting. First, on behalf of the people of all walks of life in the capital and the entire Chinese people, he expressed heartfelt thanks and warm congratulations to Prince Sihanouk and all the Cambodian distinguished guests. He said, "The long-standing traditional friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian people has now been fixed in the form of a treaty. This marks that the friendly relations between our two countries have entered a new stage. This is a victory for the friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Cambodian people, and also a victory for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence." He pointed out that "the signing of the Sino-Cambodian Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression is inseparable from the efforts of His Royal Highness the Prince."

Peng Zhen emphasized, "The Chinese people are proud to have a friend like Cambodia, and the Cambodian people can believe that in the struggle to safeguard national independence and world peace, the Chinese people will always be their friends!" Peng Zhen's words were warmly applauded.

Peng Zhen further pointed out in his speech, "Our two peoples have long suffered from colonial oppression, and we are both resolutely opposed to colonialism. Our two peoples both love peace and need a peaceful international environment to build our own countries. It is precisely because of this that both of our countries steadfastly adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the spirit of the Bandung Conference."

Peng Zhen said that His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk and the Royal Government of Cambodia have consistently supported our country's peaceful diplomatic policy and the proposition of striving for peaceful coexistence among countries with different social systems. The development of friendly and cooperative relations between China and Cambodia in international affairs, based on mutual respect, mutual trust, and mutual support, is a good example of the implementation of peaceful coexistence among countries with different social systems.

Peng Zhen pointed out, when talking about the signing of treaties of friendship and non-aggression or treaties of peace and friendship with a series of Asian and African countries by our government in the past year, "Our friends are becoming more and more numerous, while those who oppose us are becoming increasingly isolated."

Peng Zhen praised the Cambodian people, under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk, for waging continuous struggles against the sabotage and subversion plots of imperialism and its followers, and for defending national independence and state sovereignty. He said, "His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk and the Royal Government of Cambodia advocate the immediate and complete elimination of colonialism, which is a strong support for all countries and peoples who are striving for national independence."

Peng Zhen said that the imperialist colonial system is now collapsing. The day to completely and finally bury colonialism is not far off. Peng Zhen also pointed out that imperialism and colonialism are by no means reconciled to their failure, and they are carrying out frantic struggles and counterattacks.

Peng Zhen pointed out, "The current situation in Laos is particularly disturbing. U.S. imperialism openly supports the Laotian rebel group, provoking and expanding the civil war in Laos. This action by the United States has grossly interfered in the internal affairs of Laos, violated the 1954 Geneva Agreements on the Laotian issue, and seriously threatened peace and security in the Indochina region."

Peng Zhen emphasized, "The Chinese people resolutely support the just struggle of the Laotian people against the interference and aggression of U.S. imperialism, and resolutely support their patriotic proposition of peace, neutrality, national independence, and national unification. The Chinese people will always stand together with all oppressed nations and oppressed peoples in the world, and with all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world, to fight to the end against the aggressive policies and war policies of new and old colonialism, and to safeguard world peace."

Peng Zhen's words constantly aroused thunderous applause from the audience.

Prince Sihanouk spoke amidst warm applause. He expressed his extremely warm gratitude to Mayor Peng Zhen for his enthusiastic words about Cambodia and the Cambodian people.

Prince Sihanouk said that the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression just signed by Cambodia and China clearly stipulates that our two countries will be forever friendly, and both sides guarantee never to participate in aggressive organizations against the other. He pointed out, "This treaty declares to all countries that the friendly relationship that links Cambodia and China is unbreakable, and it is futile for anyone who wants to undermine this friendship."

When talking about the long history of friendly relations between Cambodia and China, Prince Sihanouk said, "I should especially express my gratitude to China for the effective support she gave us when Cambodia was in the most critical moment of national survival. When we faced foreign threats, China has always, through the voices of her leaders, loudly and clearly stated her determination to support Cambodia's independence and territorial integrity. This support from China, combined with our will to defend freedom and territorial integrity and oppose aggression, is of paramount importance to our country's future."

Prince Sihanouk said that China's assistance to our country's construction has two characteristics: First, the People's China provides direct assistance to Cambodia, which has direct and great benefits for our country and our people, and prepares conditions for our country's complete economic independence, for which we express our utmost gratitude. Second, the example set by the Chinese people in the cause of building their own country is also an assistance to us, that is, moving forward bravely, persevering, uniting as one, and full of confidence. The People's China has innovated some effective inherent methods, which our country has borrowed and achieved satisfactory results.

When talking about Cambodia's position on certain major international issues of concern to the entire human race, especially Asian countries and peoples, Prince Sihanouk stated, "Cambodia is neutral. She firmly believes that the path of peaceful coexistence is in the interests of all countries and peoples. She endorses the resolutions of the Bandung Conference, and despite threats, unreasonable demands, and attacks from certain countries and governments, she has consistently respected the letter and spirit of these resolutions."

He also expressed support for the Soviet Union's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament and advocated the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

When talking about the situation in Laos, Prince Sihanouk said that the serious events currently developing in Laos threaten the stability and peace of Southeast Asia. He said, "We believe that for the benefit of the Laotian people and for the benefit of the whole world, it is imperative to seek a way to extinguish this war."

Prince Sihanouk believes that the only solution that can bring peace to the Kingdom of Laos and the Laotian people is to recognize and guarantee the neutrality of Laos and to end all foreign interference.

Prince Sihanouk emphasized, "Only a conference like the 1954 Geneva Conference can enable Laos to regain peace and enable the Laotian people to enjoy the right to choose policies and governments that conform to their interests. We ask China, the Soviet Union, the United States, India, Thailand, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Republic of Vietnam to consider holding such a conference with us and our Laotian brothers aimed at saving Laos, Southeast Asia, and world peace."

Prince Sihanouk also said that on the issue of the final elimination of colonialism, Cambodia's position and China's position are not fundamentally different, because their positions are based on the principle of the people's right to freedom and progress.

He also expressed his wish that China could soon recover that part of its territory that is still arbitrarily and unreasonably placed outside its legitimate sovereignty.

Prince Sihanouk finally said, "We are also very grateful to China because, although she is one of the most powerful countries in the world, she has not adopted a chauvinistic attitude towards our country. For some large countries, medium-sized countries, and even some small countries, they actually cannot do this. However, we are convinced that only if all large and small countries, rich and poor countries respect each other and treat each other equally, can the peoples of all countries approach each other and serve the cause of peace."

Prince Sihanouk's speech was constantly interrupted by warm and friendly applause.

After the speech, Mayor Peng Zhen presented a flag and gifts to Prince Sihanouk on behalf of the people of all walks of life in the capital. Prince Sihanouk accepted the silk banner embroidered with golden characters amidst the thunderous applause of the entire audience. The banner read: "The signing of the Sino-Cambodian Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression is a great victory for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence! The friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian people will last forever!"

Also seated on the rostrum at today's meeting were Vice-Premier of the State Council Ulanhu, Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Panchen Erdeni Qoigyi Gyaincain, Lin Feng, Vice-Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Li Siguang, Burhan, Vice-Chairmen of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong, Fu Zuoyi, President of the Supreme People's Court Xie Juezai, and Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng. Also on the rostrum were Minister of Foreign Trade Ye Jizhuang, Vice-Ministers Li Qiang, Vice-Ministers of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Ji Pengfei, Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Wang Youping, Chairman of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee Liao Chengzhi, President of the China-Cambodia Friendship Association Qi Yanming, Beijing leaders Liu Ren, Feng Jiping, Wu Han, Wang Kunlun, Jia Tingsan, Yue Songsheng, as well as responsible persons from various aspects of Beijing.

    首都盛会欢迎西哈努克亲王  同时庆祝中柬签订友好和互不侵犯条约
    彭真市长和西哈努克亲王强调中柬人民友好合作的重大意义
    一致指出必须终止对老挝的外来干涉保障东南亚和平与安全
    新华社19日讯　首都各界人民一万多人今天下午在人民大会堂隆重集会，热烈欢迎柬埔寨国家元首诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王，并且庆祝中柬两国政府今天庄严签订中柬友好和互不侵犯条约。
    今天的盛会显示了中柬两国友好关系进入了一个新的阶段，中柬友好和互不侵犯条约的签订，成为两国人民政治生活中的一件大喜事。当会上宣布今天下午两国政府签订条约的消息时，会场上响起了长时间的暴风雨般的掌声。
    人民大会堂呈现一片欢腾的景象。主席台上被各色鲜花装饰得五彩缤纷。主席台正中并排高悬着巨大的中国和柬埔寨两国的国旗，两国国旗的下端连结一起，上面托着一大簇艳丽的鲜花，象征着中柬两国人民的友谊开出了愈来愈多的灿烂的花朵。会场上还悬挂着用中柬两国文字书写的巨幅标语：“中国和柬埔寨人民友好万岁！”“世界和平万岁！”
    四时十分，西哈努克亲王和夫人，以及柬埔寨王位最高委员会副主席宾努，首相福·波伦，第一副首相?·刁隆等贵宾，由刘少奇主席、董必武副主席、朱德委员长、周恩来总理、陈毅副总理、北京市市长彭真等领导人陪同，走上主席台。这时，全场万人起立，发出了春雷般的热烈掌声。
    同他们一起登上主席台的贵宾，还有西哈努克亲王的公主、王子，柬埔寨的一些高级官员，柬埔寨驻中国大使兰·?特等。首都少年儿童向西哈努克亲王和全体柬埔寨贵宾献了鲜花。
    大会开始以后，乐队高奏柬埔寨和中国国歌。
    彭真市长在会上发表了热情的讲话。他首先代表首都各界人民和全中国人民，向西哈努克亲王和柬埔寨全体贵宾们表示衷心的感谢和热烈的祝贺。他说：“中柬两国人民之间源远流长的传统友谊，现在用条约的形式固定下来了。这标志着我们两国的友好关系已经进入了一个新的阶段。这是中柬两国人民友好合作的胜利，也是和平共处五项原则的胜利。”他指出，“中柬友好和互不侵犯条约的签订是和亲王殿下的努力分不开的。”
    彭真强调说：“中国人民因为有柬埔寨这样的朋友而感到自豪，柬埔寨人民可以相信，在维护民族独立和世界和平的斗争中，中国人民永远是他们的朋友！”彭真的这些话，受到了热烈的鼓掌欢迎。
    彭真在讲话中还进一步指出：“我们两国人民长期遭受过殖民主义的压迫，我们都坚决反对殖民主义。我们两国人民都热爱和平，都需要一个和平的国际环境来建设自己的国家。正是因为这样，我们两国都坚定不移地信守和平共处五项原则和万隆会议精神。”
    彭真说，西哈努克亲王殿下和柬埔寨王国政府一贯支持我国的和平外交政策和争取不同社会制度国家和平共处的主张。中柬两国在国际事务中互相尊重、互相信赖、互相支持的友好合作关系的发展，是不同社会制度国家实行和平共处的良好榜样。
    彭真在谈到一年来我国政府同一系列的亚非国家签订友好和互不侵犯条约或者和平友好条约时指出：“我们的朋友越来越多，而反对我们的人却越来越孤立”。
    彭真赞扬说，柬埔寨人民在西哈努克亲王领导下，同帝国主义及其追随者的破坏和颠复阴谋进行了不断的斗争，捍卫了民族独立和国家的主权。他说，“西哈努克亲王殿下和柬埔寨王国政府主张刻不容缓地彻底消灭殖民主义，这是对一切正在争取民族独立的国家和人民的有力支持。”
    彭真说，现在帝国主义殖民体系正在土崩瓦解。彻底和最后地埋葬殖民主义的日子已经不远了。彭真同时指出，帝国主义和殖民主义决不甘心自己的失败，它们正在进行疯狂的挣扎和反扑。
    彭真指出：“当前老挝局势特别令人不安。美帝国主义公开支持老挝叛乱集团，挑起并扩大老挝内战。美国这一行动，粗暴地干涉了老挝的内政，破坏了1954年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，严重地威胁着印度支那地区的和平和安全。”
    彭真强调说：“中国人民坚决支持老挝人民为反对美帝国主义的干涉和侵略而进行的正义斗争，坚决支持他们的和平中立、民族独立和国家统一的爱国主张。中国人民将始终同全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民一起，同全世界爱好和平的国家和人民一起，为反对新旧殖民主义的侵略政策和战争政策、维护世界和平而斗争到底。”
    彭真的这些话，不断地激起了全场暴风雨般的掌声。
    西哈努克亲王在热烈的掌声中讲话。他对彭真市长对柬埔寨和柬埔寨人民所说的热情洋溢的话表示极其热烈的感谢。
    西哈努克亲王说，刚才柬埔寨和中国所签订的友好和互不侵犯条约明确规定，我们两国将永远友好下去，双方并保证决不参加针对另一方的侵略性的组织。他指出：“这一条约向各国宣告，把柬埔寨和中国联结在一起的友好关系是牢不可破的，谁想破坏这种友谊那是枉费心机的。”
    西哈努克亲王在谈到柬中两国友好关系的悠久历史时，他说：“我特别应该对中国表示感激，感谢她在我们柬埔寨在民族生存最危急的时刻所给予的有效的支持。当我们面临着外来威胁的时候，中国一贯通过她的领导人的呼声，响亮地和明确地表明她对支持柬埔寨独立和领土完整的决心。中国的这一支持和我们维护自由与领土完整及反对侵略的意志结合在一起，对我国的未来具有头等重要的意义。”
    西哈努克亲王说，中国对我国建设的援助具有两个特点：第一，人民中国向柬埔寨提供直接的援助，对我国和我国人民有着直接的巨大的利益，并且为我国经济上的完全独立准备条件，我们表示万分感谢。第二，中国人民在建设自己国家的事业中所树立的榜样，也是对我们的一种援助，这就是说，勇往直前，坚韧不拔，团结一致，信心十足。人民中国对某些行之有效的固有的办法进行了革新，我国借用了这些办法，并且获得了圆满的结果。
    西哈努克亲王在谈到柬埔寨对整个人类特别是亚洲国家和人民所关心的某些重大国际问题的立场时，他表示：“柬埔寨是中立的。她坚决相信，和平共处的道路是符合所有国家和人民的利益的。她赞同万隆会议的各项决议，并且尽管某些国家和政府对她的威胁、无理要求和攻击，她依然一贯尊重这些决议的文字和精神。”
    他还表示支持苏联提出的全面彻底裁军的建议和主张恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位。
    在谈到老挝的局势时，西哈努克亲王说，目前在老挝发展着的严重事件，威胁着东南亚的稳定与和平。他说：“我们认为，为了老挝人民的利益，为了全世界的利益，必须刻不容缓地寻求扑灭这场战火的办法。”
    西哈努克亲王认为，唯一能够使老挝王国和老挝人民获得和平的解决办法，是承认和保证老挝的中立，并终止一切外来干涉。
    西哈努克亲王强调说：“只有像1954年日内瓦会议那样的会议才能使老挝有可能重新获得和平，才能使老挝人民享有选择符合自己利益的政策和政府的权利。我们要求中国、苏联、美国、印度、泰国、越南民主共和国以及越南共和国同我们和我们的老挝兄弟一起考虑举行这样一次旨在拯救老挝以及东南亚和世界和平的会议。”
    西哈努克亲王还说，关于最后消灭殖民主义的问题，柬埔寨的立场和中国的立场是没有基本上的分歧的，因为她们的立场都是以人民对自由和进步的权利的原则为基础的。
    他还表示：愿中国能够早日恢复仍然被横蛮无理地置于她的合法主权以外的那部分领土。
    西哈努克亲王最后说：“我们还十分感激中国，因为，尽管她是世界最强大的国家之一，但是她对我国却没有采取沙文主义的态度。对某些大国、中等国家，以至某些小国来说，他们实际上做不到这一点，然而，我们确信，只有一切大国和小国、富国和穷国彼此之间相互尊重和平等对待，才能使各国人民互相接近，并为和平事业服务。”
    西哈努克亲王的这些讲话，不断地为热烈友好的掌声所打断。
    讲话以后，彭真市长代表首都各界人民向西哈努克亲王献旗献礼。西哈努克亲王在全场雷动的掌声中接过绣着金色大字的锦旗。锦旗上写道：“中柬友好和互不侵犯条约的签订是和平共处五项原则的伟大胜利！中柬两国人民的友谊万古长青！”
    今天在大会主席台上就座的还有，国务院副总理乌兰夫，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长郭沫若、黄炎培、班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞、林枫，政协全国委员会副主席李四光、包尔汉，国防委员会副主席张治中、傅作义，最高人民法院院长谢觉哉，最高人民检察院检察长张鼎丞。在主席台上的还有对外贸易部部长叶季壮、副部长李强，外交部副部长章汉夫、姬鹏飞，中国驻柬埔寨大使王幼平，中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志，中国柬埔寨友好协会会长齐燕铭，北京市的负责人刘仁、冯基平、吴晗、王昆仑、贾庭三、乐松生，以及北京市各方面的负责人。
