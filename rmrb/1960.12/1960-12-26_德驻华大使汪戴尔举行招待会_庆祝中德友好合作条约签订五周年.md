    Xinhua News Agency, December 25th. German Democratic Republic Ambassador to China, Wang Dalei, held a reception at the embassy this evening to warmly celebrate to Fifth Anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between the People's republic of China and the German Democratic Republic.

    Vice Premier of the State Council Xi Zhongxun was invited to attend the reception.

    Also invited to attend the reception were Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu and Zeng Yongquan, President of the Sino-German Friendship Association Zhu Kezhen, as well as leading members of various departments of state organs and people's organizations, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and people from all walks of life in the capital.

    The diplomatic envoys of socialist countries in China also attended the reception.

    Ambassador Wang Dalei and Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun spoke at the reception successively. They warmly congratulated the Fifth Anniversary of the signing of the Sino-German Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, pointing out that the signing of the Sino-German Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation has further consolidated and developed the fraternal friendship between the people of China and the German Democratic Republic on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and has strengthened the mutual support and close cooperation between China and Germany in the political, economic, cultural, scientific and technological fields, and has promoted the common cause of socialist construction of the people of China and Germany, and has played a positive role in consolidating the unity of the socialist camp and safeguarding world peace.

    In his speech, Ambassador Wang Dalei pointed out that the German Democratic Republic is the true embodiment of the peace-loving efforts of the German people and the outpost of socialism in Western Europe. In the struggle against the evil war plans of German militarism resurging in West Germany, it has been able to rely on the entire socialist camp in the past and present. The moral, political and economic support of the great fraternal Chinese people is of great significance to the German Democratic Republic. Under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the working people of the German Democratic Republic are advancing socialist construction at a rapid pace, demonstrating the comprehensive superiority of socialism over the capitalist system in West Germany. Through the comprehensive development of socialist construction, the German Democratic Republic has made a significant contribution to safeguarding peace in Europe.

    He talked about the contribution made by the German Democratic Republic to implementing the policy of peaceful coexistence. He mentioned that the government of the German Democratic Republic recently put forward a four-point proposal to the West German government, including guaranteeing ten years of peace and renouncing the use of force during this period. He said that this proposal could help ease tensions in Europe and promote the policy of peaceful coexistence.

    He said that the German Democratic Republic firmly supports the Chinese people's struggle to liberate their territory of Taiwan from the occupation of US imperialism, strongly condemns the conspiracy to create "two Chinas," and condemns the conspiracy of US imperialism to refuse to restore the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

    He said, "We are celebrating the fifth anniversary of the signing of our treaty of friendship at a time when the Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties has put forward new and great tasks to the countries of the socialist camp and all progressive and peaceful forces. The unity of the socialist camp with the Soviet Union as its vanguard, and the cooperation and mutual assistance in the development of socialist countries in the process of implementing the Moscow resolution, will enable the socialist world system to achieve new achievements and victories, and to be further strengthened and consolidated, thereby increasingly strengthening its influence as a decisive factor in the world political arena."

    Ambassador Wang Dalei said that we will unite more closely to protect the fundamental interests of our two peoples and all mankind, and the cooperation between our two countries and two peoples will be more fruitful.

    In his speech, Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun, on behalf of the government and people of the People's Republic of China, extended warm congratulations to the government and people of the German Democratic Republic.

    After explaining the significance of the Sino-German Treaty of Friendship, Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun warmly praised the great achievements made the people in the German Democratic Republic in socialist construction and socialist reform under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the government of the German Democratic Republic. He said that the Chinese people are delighted and encouraged by the achievements of the people of the German Democratic Republic. Because your achievements are our achievements, and they are also the achievements of the entire socialist camp.

    When talking about the contribution made by the German Democratic Republic to safeguarding European and world peace, Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun said that recently, the German Democratic Republic has put forward new proposals to the West German government, such as guaranteeing ten years of peace and renouncing the use of force during this period by both sides. This is another effort made by the German Democratic Republic to peacefully resolve the German question and ease tensions in Europe.

    Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun pointed out that, in contrast to the peace-loving German Democratic Republic, West Germany is increasingly becoming a source of serious war danger in Europe. The result of US imperialism's rearmament of West Germany has already brought an increasingly serious threat to peace and security in Europe, which cannot but arouse the serious vigilance of the people of European countries and peace-loving people all over the world. In the struggle against the aggressive ambitions of West German militarism supported by US imperialism, the German Democratic Republic bears a great responsibility. He said that the Soviet Union, China, and the entire socialist camp stand firmly with the German Democratic Republic. At any time, the Chinese people will fully support the just struggle of the people of the German Democratic Republic against imperialist aggression, and consider this to be our sacred internationalist obligation.

    When talking about the recent conference of Communist and Workers' Parties in Moscow, Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun said that this conference and the documents it adopted are of great significance for further promoting the struggle of the people of all countries for world peace, national liberation, democratic freedom, and socialism. We are deeply convinced that on the new basis of the declaration of the conference of Communist and Workers' Parties, the unity and friendship between the people of China and Germany and the people of all countries in the socialist camp will be further strengthened.

    In his speech, Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun also expressed heartfelt thanks, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, to the people of the German Democratic Republic who have always supported our socialist construction, opposed US imperialist aggression, and safeguarded our national sovereignty and territorial integrity.

    The reception was held in an atmosphere of friendship and unity.

    庆祝中德友好合作条约签订五周年
    新华社25日讯　德意志民主共和国驻中国大使汪戴尔今天晚间在大使馆举行招待会，热烈庆祝中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国友好合作条约签订五周年。
    国务院副总理习仲勋应邀出席了招待会。
    应邀出席招待会的，还有外交部副部长章汉夫、曾涌泉，中德友好协会会长竺可桢以及国家机关各部门、各人民团体的负责人，中国人民解放军高级将领，以及首都各方面的人士。
    社会主义各国驻中国的使节也出席了招待会。
    汪戴尔大使和习仲勋副总理在招待会上先后讲话。他们热烈祝贺中德友好合作条约签订五周年，指出中德友好合作条约的签订，使中德两国人民建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的兄弟友谊得到了进一步的巩固和发展，加强了中德两国在政治、经济、文化、科学技术各个方面的互相支持和亲密合作，促进了中德两国人民建设社会主义的共同事业，对巩固社会主义阵营的团结和维护世界和平起了积极的作用。
    汪戴尔大使在讲话中指出，德意志民主共和国是德国人民的爱好和平的努力的真正的体现者和社会主义在西欧的前哨。在反对在西德卷土重来的德国军国主义的罪恶的战争计划的斗争中，它过去和现在都能依靠整个社会主义阵营。伟大的兄弟中国人民在道义上、政治上和经济上的支持，这对德意志民主共和国来说具有非常重大的意义。德意志民主共和国劳动人民在德国统一社会党的领导下以迅速的步伐推进社会主义建设，显示了社会主义对西德资本主义制度的全面优越性。通过全面展开的社会主义建设，德意志民主共和国对保障欧洲和平作出了重大贡献。
    他谈到了德意志民主共和国为贯彻和平共处政策所作出的贡献。他讲到德意志民主共和国政府最近向西德政府提出了包括保证十年和平并在这期间放弃使用武力的四点建议。他说，这个建议能够有助于缓和欧洲的紧张局势和促进和平共处的政策。
    他说，德意志民主共和国坚决地支持中国人民争取把自己的领土台湾从美帝国主义占领下解放出来的斗争，严厉谴责制造“两个中国”的阴谋，谴责美帝国主义拒绝恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位的阴谋。
    他说，“我们是在这样一个时候庆祝我们的友好条约签订五周年的。在这个时候，各国共产党和工人党在莫斯科代表会议向社会主义阵营各国和所有进步与和平的力量提出了新的巨大任务。以苏联为其先锋队的社会主义阵营的团结一致、在实现莫斯科决议的过程中社会主义各国发展的合作与互助，将使社会主义世界体系取得新的成就和胜利，并获得进一步的加强和巩固，从而使它作为世界政治舞台的决定性因素的影响日益加强。”
    汪戴尔大使说，我们将为了保护我们两国人民和全人类的根本利益更加紧密地团结在一起，我们两国和两国人民之间的合作将会更加卓有成效。
    习仲勋副总理在讲话中，代表中华人民共和国政府和中国人民向德意志民主共和国政府和人民表示热烈的祝贺。
    习仲勋副总理讲述了中德友好条约的意义后，热烈赞扬德意志民主共和国人民在德国统一社会党和德意志民主共和国政府的领导下，在社会主义建设和社会主义改造方面取得了巨大的成就。他说，中国人民对于德意志民主共和国人民取得的成就感到欢欣鼓舞。因为你们的成就，就是我们的成就，也就是整个社会主义阵营的成就。
    习仲勋副总理在谈到德意志民主共和国为维护欧洲和世界和平所作的贡献时说，最近，德意志民主共和国又向西德政府提出了保证十年和平并且在这个期间双方放弃使用武力等新的建议。这是德意志民主共和国为了和平解决德国问题和缓和欧洲紧张局势所作的又一次努力。
    习仲勋副总理指出：同爱好和平的德意志民主共和国相反，西德正日益成为欧洲严重战争危险的策源地。美帝国主义重新武装西德的结果，已经给欧洲的和平和安全带来了日益严重的威胁，这不能不引起欧洲各国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民的严重警惕。在反对美帝国主义支持下的西德军国主义的侵略野心的斗争中，德意志民主共和国肩负着重大的责任。他说，苏联、中国和整个社会主义阵营坚决地同德意志民主共和国站在一起。无论在什么时候，中国人民都将全力支持德意志民主共和国人民反对帝国主义侵略的正义斗争，并且认为这是我们神圣的国际主义义务。
    在讲到不久前在莫斯科召开的共产党和工人党代表会议时，习仲勋副总理说，这次会议及其所通过的文件，对于进一步促进各国人民争取世界和平、民族解放、民主自由、社会主义的斗争，具有伟大的意义。我们深信，在各国共产党和工人党代表会议声明的新的基础上，中德两国人民和社会主义阵营各国人民的团结和友谊，必将得到进一步的加强。
    习仲勋副总理在讲话中还代表中国政府和中国人民，对一贯支持我国社会主义建设、反对美帝国主义侵略和维护国家主权、领土完整斗争的德意志民主共和国人民表示衷心感谢。
    招待会在友好和团结的气氛中进行。
