We, the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries from the five continents of the world, who have come to Moscow on the occasion of the forty-third anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, call on you with a sense of responsibility for the destiny of mankind:

Participate in the universal struggle to defend peace and oppose the threat of a new world war.

Three years ago, the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries issued a peace declaration to the people of the world.

Since then, the forces of peace have achieved remarkable victories in the struggle against the instigators of war.

Today, with even stronger confidence in the victory of the cause of peace, we rise up against the danger of war that threatens millions of men, women, and children. Never before in human history has there been such a real possibility to realize the aspirations of all peoples for generations, namely, to live in peace and freedom.

Faced with the threat of a war catastrophe that would cause enormous sacrifices and the death of hundreds of millions of people, and would turn the major centers of world civilization into ruins, the issue of maintaining peace is more pressing for all mankind than ever before.

We Communists fight for peace, for universal security, and for creating conditions in which all people and all nations can enjoy peaceful and free lives.

The goal of every socialist country and the entire socialist family is to ensure lasting peace for all peoples.

Socialism does not need war. The historical struggle between the old and new systems, between socialism and capitalism, does not need to be resolved through world war, but through peaceful competition. This means: which social system can achieve higher levels of economic, technological, and cultural development in the competition, and ensure better living conditions for the masses of the people.

We Communists believe that it is our sacred duty to do everything in our power to save mankind from the scourge of modern war.

All socialist countries, following the teachings of the great Lenin, base their foreign policy on the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems.

In our time, for all peoples and all countries, there is no other path than peaceful coexistence and competition between socialism and capitalism, or a nuclear war that would slaughter humanity.

Where does the threat to world peace come from?

Governments of all countries talk about peace, but what matters is not talk but action.

Now, as in the past, the organizers and instigators of aggressive war are the reactionary monopoly military groups of the imperialist countries. The policies of the governments of imperialist powers threaten peace. Against the will of their own people, they impose a disastrous arms race on all countries, stir up the Cold War against socialist countries and other peace-loving countries, and suppress the people's desire for freedom.

Look at the facts!

The people of all countries welcome the Soviet proposal for complete and thorough disarmament under supervision, which is enthusiastically supported by all socialist countries. Who is opposing the implementation of these proposals? It is the governments of the imperialist countries, led by the United States. They do not want disarmament under supervision, but only talk about supervising armaments, attempting to turn disarmament negotiations into empty talk.

The people of all countries are pleased that there have been no nuclear weapons tests by the three major powers for two years. Who opposes taking new measures and passing resolutions to completely ban such murderous tests? It is the governments of the imperialist countries. They constantly declare their intention to resume atomic weapons testing and frequently threaten to disrupt negotiations on banning atomic weapons testing. They are forced to participate in these negotiations only under the pressure of the people.

The people of all countries do not want foreign military bases to remain on their sovereign territories; they oppose aggressive military treaties because these treaties restrict the independence of their countries and put their countries in danger.

Who opposes the will of the people?

It is the governments of the Atlantic Alliance countries, which provide the West German militarists and revanchists with military bases on foreign territory, provide them with weapons of mass destruction, and accelerate the arming of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's forces with atomic weapons.

It is the ruling circles of the United States who impose aggressive military treaties on Japan, Pakistan, and other countries in the Middle East and Far East, instigating them against peace-loving countries, occupying South Korea and turning it into their military springboard, reviving Japanese militarism, interfering in the internal affairs of Laos and South Vietnam, supporting the Dutch imperialists in West Irian, the Belgian imperialists in the Congo, the Portuguese imperialists in Goa, and other colonialists, preparing for armed intervention against the Cuban revolution, and dragging Latin American countries into military alliances.

It is the United States that occupies China's Taiwan, constantly sends military aircraft to invade the airspace of the People's Republic of China, and at the same time, infringes upon the legitimate right of the People's Republic of China to enjoy a representative seat in the United Nations.

Rocket launchers ready to fire at any time, warehouses full of nuclear weapons, planes carrying hydrogen bombs flying in the air, warships and submarines sailing in the ocean ready to attack at any time, and a network of military bases set up on foreign territory, this is the actual activity of imperialism today. In this situation, any country in the world, whether it is a large country or a small country, can suddenly be engulfed in the flames of nuclear war.

Imperialism is pushing the world to the brink of war for the private interests of a small handful of large monopolies and colonialists.

The enemies of peace spread the deceptive lie of fictitious "communist aggression." They need this lie to conceal their true purpose, paralyze the will of the people, and justify the arms race in the face of the people.

Workers, peasants, and intellectuals!

Good people all over the world!

In our days, for mankind, there is no more urgent task than to oppose the threat of rocket-nuclear war, to strive for universal and complete disarmament, and to defend peace. In our days, there is no more noble duty than to participate in this struggle.

Is it possible to establish a lasting world peace?

We Communists answer:

War is not inevitable, war can be prevented, peace can be defended and consolidated.

Our belief is not only based on our will to fight for peace and our hatred of war instigators. The possibility of preventing war is derived from the facts of the new world situation.

The world socialist system is becoming an increasingly decisive factor in modern times. The socialist system, which includes more than one-third of mankind, and its main force—the Soviet Union—are using their growing economic and scientific and technological strength to limit the actions of imperialism and to restrain the hands and feet of military adventurers.

The international workers' movement, holding high the banner of fighting for peace, is raising the vigilance of the people and inspiring all honest people in the world to take active action against the imperialists' aggressive policies.

The millions of people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America who have already gained freedom and political independence, as well as the people who are fighting for national freedom, are becoming increasingly active warriors for peace and natural allies of the socialist countries' peaceful policies.

There are also neutral countries that advocate peace and peaceful coexistence and disagree with the imperialists' aggressive policies.

The world peace movement now unites hundreds of millions of people. In every country, those who participate in this movement strive to defend their motherland and save it from the flames of a new war.

All these peace-loving forces, united in a resolute struggle, can shatter the evil war plans, defend peace, and consolidate friendship among all peoples.

Peace will not come automatically. Peace can only be maintained and consolidated through the joint struggle of all peace-loving forces.

We Communists appeal to all working people and to the people of all continents:

Fight to ease international tensions and strive for peaceful coexistence, to oppose the "Cold War," and to oppose the arms race! If the vast funds spent on armaments could be used for peaceful purposes, it would be possible to improve the conditions of the masses of the people, reduce unemployment, raise wages and living standards, increase housing construction, and implement social insurance more extensively.

Do not allow the expansion of atomic armaments, and do not allow German militarism and Japanese militarism to be armed with weapons of mass destruction!

Demand the conclusion of a peace treaty with the two Germanys and make West Berlin a demilitarized free city!

Fight against the attempts of the governments of imperialist countries to drag more countries into the Cold War and onto the path of war preparations!

Demand the abolition of military bases established on foreign territories, the withdrawal of troops stationed on foreign territories, and a ban on the establishment of new military bases. Fight to free those countries that have been forced to accept aggressive military treaties from these treaties! Strive for agreements on nuclear-free zones!

Do not allow the U.S. monopoly organizations to strangle the freedom of the heroic Cuban people with economic blockades and armed intervention!

We Communists, who fight for the cause of the working class and the people of all countries, extend our hands to social democrats, members of other parties and organizations that strive for peace, all trade union members, and all patriots: act with us to defend peace and strive for disarmament! Let us seek unified action!

Let us establish a common front against the imperialists preparing a new war!

Let us fight together to defend democratic rights and freedoms, to oppose reactionary forces and the dark forces of fascism, against racism and chauvinism, against the tyranny of monopoly organizations, and against the militarization of economic and political life.

The struggle of the people of all countries for their own freedom and independence weakens the forces of war and strengthens the forces of peace.

Africa has awakened and is moving towards a new life. The African people have suffered the most from the disasters of colonialist enslavement and brutal exploitation. The African people are establishing their own independent countries, and they are stepping onto the stage of history as a young, increasingly independent and peace-loving force.

However, colonialism, which is destined to perish in history, has not been completely eliminated.

Savage violence and terror are hindering the people of East Africa—the people of the British and Portuguese colonies—from moving towards freedom. The racist system is rampant in the Union of South Africa. The heroic Algerian people have been shedding blood and sacrificing themselves in war for six years to fight for the right to national independence, a war imposed on them by French colonialists supported by their Atlantic allies. In the Congo, imperialists have used all means, with conspiracies and bribery, to overthrow the legitimate government and hand over power to their docile puppets.

The people of all countries who have already gained the right to national independence continue to wage arduous struggles against all new forms of colonialism, against American and West German colonialists, and against British, French, and other old oppressors. These colonialists and oppressors are trying at all costs to keep the natural wealth, mines, and plantations of these independent countries in their hands, hinder their industrial development, and forcibly establish traitorous and reactionary governments in these countries.

Brothers and sisters of all countries liberated from colonialism! Brothers and sisters of all countries fighting for your own liberation!

The death knell of colonialism has sounded!

We Communists are with you! The powerful socialist camp is with you!

Together with you, we demand the immediate and unconditional recognition of the right of all nations to independent existence.

Let the wealth of your country and the efforts of the working people be used only for the welfare of your people!

Your struggle for sovereign integrity and economic independence, and for your own freedom, serves the sacred cause of peace!

We, the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties, call on

Men, women, and young people,

People of all professions and all social strata,

All people, regardless of their political beliefs and religious faiths, regardless of their nationality and skin color,

All who love their motherland and hate war,

Demand an immediate ban on the testing, production, and use of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction,

Demand the immediate conclusion of a treaty on complete and thorough disarmament under supervision.

Let modern science and technology no longer help to create weapons that bring death and destruction, let them serve the welfare of people and the progress of mankind!

Let friendly cooperation, broad trade, and cultural exchanges among all countries replace military blocs!

In our time,

The forces of peace outweigh the forces of war!

If the people of all countries unite for peace and friendship among all peoples, and carry out a persistent and active struggle, they will surely achieve their lofty goals—defending peace.

Communists will dedicate all their strength to this cause.

Peace will surely triumph over war!

### 各国共产党和工人党代表会议告世界人民书

    各国共产党和工人党代表会议告世界人民书
    我们，在伟大的十月社会主义革命四十三周年的时候，来到莫斯科的世界五大洲的各国共产党和工人党的代表们，满怀着对人类命运的责任感，号召你们：
    参加保卫和平、反对新的世界大战威胁的普遍斗争。
    三年前，各国共产党和工人党向全世界人民发出了和平宣言。
    从那时起，和平力量在反对战争挑拨者的斗争中取得了卓越的胜利。
    今天，我们对和平事业的胜利怀着更加坚定的信心，起来反对威胁千百万男人、女人和儿童的战争危险。在人类历史上，从来还没有过这样的现实可能性，使各国人民世世代代的愿望，即生活在和平和自由条件下的愿望，得以实现。
    面临着会引起巨大牺牲和亿万人死亡、会使世界文明的主要中心变为废墟的战争灾难的威胁，维护和平的问题，比任何时候都更加激动着全人类。
    我们共产党人，为和平、为普遍安全、为创造所有的人和所有的民族都能享受和平和自由生活的条件而斗争。
    每一个社会主义国家和整个社会主义大家庭的目的，就是为各国人民确保持久的和平。
    社会主义不需要战争。新旧制度之间、社会主义和资本主义之间的历史性斗争，不需要通过世界战争的途径，而要通过和平竞赛来解决。这就是：究竟哪一个社会制度在竞赛中能达到经济、技术和文化的较高水平，能保证人民群众获得更好的生活条件。
    我们共产党人认为，尽自己一切力量拯救人类免于现代战争的灾害，是自己的神圣义务。
    所有社会主义国家，遵循伟大列宁的学说，把不同社会制度国家和平共处的原则作为自己对外政策的基础。
    在我们的时代，对于各国人民和各个国家说来，或者是社会主义同资本主义的和平共处和竞赛，或者是屠杀人类的核战争，没有别的道路。
    对世界和平的威胁是从那里来的呢？
    各国政府都谈论和平，但是重要的不是谈论而是行动。
    现在同过去一样，侵略战争的组织者和策动者，是帝国主义国家反动的垄断的军事集团。帝国主义大国政府的政策威胁着和平，它们违反本国人民的意志，把招致灾害的军备竞赛强加于各国，煽起反对社会主义国家和其他爱好和平国家的冷战，压制人民爱好自由的愿望。
    请看事实吧！
    各国人民欢迎苏联提出的并且受到所有社会主义国家热烈支持的有关全面彻底和有监督的裁军建议。谁在反对这些建议的实现呢？是以美国为首的帝国主义国家政府，它们不要有监督的裁军，而只谈对军备的监督，企图把裁军谈判变成空谈。
    各国人民对两年来三个大国没有进行核武器试验感到高兴。是谁反对采取新的措施和通过决定来完全禁止这种杀人的试验呢？是帝国主义国家的政府。它们不断宣称想要恢复原子武器的试验，并且经常威胁要破坏关于禁止原子武器试验的谈判。它们只是在人民的压力下才被迫参加这种谈判的。
    各国人民不愿意在他们享有主权的领土上保留外国军事基地；他们反对侵略性的军事条约，因为这些条约限制他们国家的独立，并且使他们的国家处于危险的境地。
    是谁反对人民的意志呢？
    是大西洋集团国家的政府，它们给西德军国主义者和复仇主义者在外国领土上提供军事基地，给他们提供大规模杀伤的武器，并且用原子武器加速武装北大西洋公约集团的军队。
    是美国的统治集团把侵略性的军事条约强加于日本、巴基斯坦和中东以及远东的其他国家，唆使它们反对爱好和平的国家，占领南朝鲜并把它变成自己的军事跳板，复活日本军国主义，干涉老挝和南越的内政，支持在西伊里安的荷兰帝国主义者、在刚果的比利时帝国主义者、在果阿的葡萄牙帝国主义者以及其他殖民主义者，准备对古巴革命进行武装干涉，把拉丁美洲各国拖进军事同盟。
    是美国侵占中国的台湾，经常派军用飞机侵入中华人民共和国的领空，同时，还侵害中华人民共和国在联合国中享有代表席位的合法权利。
    随时准备发射的火箭装置，装满核子武器的仓库，在空中飞行的携有氢弹的飞机，在海洋中行驶的随时准备进攻的军舰和潜水艇，设在外国领土上的军事基地网，这就是帝国主义现在的实际活动。在这种情况下，世界上的任何国家，不论它是大国还是小国，都可能突然被核战争的火焰所笼罩。
    帝国主义为了一小撮大垄断组织和殖民主义者的私利，把世界推向战争的边缘。
    和平的敌人散布虚构的“共产主义侵略”的骗人谎言。他们需要这种谎言，是为了掩饰自己真正的目的，麻痹人民的意志，在人民面前为军备竞赛进行辩解。
    工人们，农民们，脑力劳动者们！
    全世界善良的人们！
    在我们的日子里，对于人类来说，没有比反对火箭—核战争的威胁、争取普遍彻底裁军、维护和平的斗争更迫切的任务了。在我们的日子里，没有比参加这个斗争更为崇高的义务了。
    建立持久的世界和平是否可能呢？
    我们共产党人回答说：
    战争不是不可避免的，战争是可以防止的，和平是可以保卫住和巩固起来的。
    我们的这一信念，不只是出于我们争取和平的意志和对战争挑拨者的憎恨。防止战争的可能性是从世界新形势的事实中引伸出来的。
    世界社会主义体系正在成为现代越来越具有决定性的因素。包括三分之一以上人类的社会主义体系及其主要力量——苏联，正在利用自己不断增长的经济力量和科学技术力量，来限制帝国主义的行动，束缚军事冒险分子的手脚。
    高举为和平而斗争的旗帜的国际工人运动，提高着人民的警惕性，鼓舞着全世界一切正直的人们积极行动起来，反对帝国主义者的侵略政策。
    已经获得自由和政治独立的千百万亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的人民以及正在争取民族自由的人民，正成为越来越积极的和平战士，成为社会主义国家和平政策的当然同盟军。
    主张和平与和平共处的还有不同意帝国主义者的侵略政策的中立国家。
    现在世界和平运动团结着千百万人。在每个国家中，参加这一运动的人都力图保卫自己的祖国，使它免遭新的战火。
    所有这些团结起来进行坚决斗争的爱好和平的力量，能够粉碎罪恶的战争计划，保卫住和平，并且巩固各国人民之间的友谊。
    和平是不会自行到来的。只有通过一切爱好和平力量的共同斗争，才能维护和巩固和平。
    我们共产党人向一切劳动者，向各大洲的人民呼吁：
    为缓和国际紧张局势和争取和平共处，为反对“冷战”，为反对军备竞赛而斗争！如果能把消耗在军备上的大量资金用于和平目的，就有可能改善人民群众的状况，减少失业，提高工资和生活水平，增加住宅建筑，更广泛地实行社会保险。
    不许扩大原子军备，不许用大规模杀伤武器武装德国军国主义和日本军国主义！
    要求同两个德国缔结和约，并使西柏林变成非军事化的自由城市！
    为反对帝国主义国家的政府企图把更多的国家拖入冷战，拖上备战的轨道而斗争！
    要求撤消设立在外国领土上的军事基地，撤退驻扎在外国领土上的军队，并禁止设立新的军事基地。为使那些被迫接受侵略性军事条约的国家摆脱这些条约而斗争！争取达成关于无核武器区的协议！
    不许美国垄断组织用经济封锁和武装干涉扼杀英雄的古巴人民的自由！
    我们，为工人阶级和各国人民的事业而斗争的共产党人，向社会民主党人、争取和平的其他党派和团体的成员们、全体工会会员们、一切爱国者们伸出手来：同我们一起为保卫和平、争取裁军而行动起来！让我们求得一致的行动吧！
    让我们建立起反对帝国主义者准备新战争的共同战线吧！
    让我们为保卫民主权利和自由，为反对反动派和法西斯黑暗势力，反对种族主义和沙文主义，反对垄断组织的专横，反对经济和政治生活的军国主义化而共同斗争。
    各国人民为争取自身自由和独立而进行的斗争，削弱着好战势力，增强着和平力量。
    非洲已经觉醒，正在走向新的生活。非洲人民遭受殖民主义奴役和野蛮剥削的灾难最为深重。非洲人民正在建立自己的独立国家，他们作为一个年青的越来越独立自主的爱好和平的力量走上历史舞台。
    但是，被历史注定要灭亡的殖民主义还没有彻底消灭。
    野蛮的暴力和恐怖阻碍着东非人民——英国和葡萄牙的殖民地的人民走向自由的道路。种族主义制度在南非联邦逞凶肆虐。英勇的阿尔及利亚人民为争取民族独立的权利，在战争中流血牺牲已经六年了，这个战争是受到大西洋同谋者所支持的法国殖民主义者强加于他们的。在刚果，帝国主义者不择手段，以阴谋诡计和收买方法推翻合法政府，把政权交给他们的驯服傀儡。
    已经取得国家独立权利的各国人民，继续为反对各种新形式的殖民主义，反对美国和西德殖民主义者，反对英国、法国和其他老牌压迫者而进行着艰苦的斗争。这些殖民主义者和压迫者企图不惜任何代价，把这些取得独立的国家的自然财富、矿井和种植场掌握在自己手中，阻碍它们的工业发展，在这些国家里强行建立卖国反动政府。
    从殖民主义下解放出来的各国兄弟们！正为自身解放而斗争的各国兄弟们！
    殖民主义的丧钟敲响了！
    我们共产党人同你们在一起！强大的社会主义国家阵营同你们在一起！
    我们同你们一起，要求立即无条件地承认一切民族有独立生存的权利。
    让你们国家的财富和劳动者的努力只用于谋取你们人民的福利吧！
    你们争取主权完整和经济独立、争取自身自由的斗争，是服务于神圣的和平事业的！
    我们，共产党和工人党的代表们号召
    男人们、妇女们和青年们，
    一切职业和一切社会阶层的人们，
    一切人们，不论他们的政治信念和宗教信仰，不论他们是哪个民族和什么肤色，
    一切热爱自己祖国和憎恨战争的人们，
    要求立即禁止试验、生产和使用核武器和其他大规模杀伤武器，
    要求立即缔结全面彻底和有监督的裁军条约。
    让现代科学和技术不再帮助制造带来死亡和毁灭的武器，让它们服务于人们的福利和人类的进步！
    让一切国家间的友好合作、广泛的贸易和文化交流来代替军事集团吧！
    在我们的时代，
    和平的力量超过战争的力量！
    如果各国人民为了和平和各国人民之间的友谊而联合起来，进行顽强的积极的斗争，就一定会达到他们所期望的崇高目的——捍卫住和平。
    共产党人将为这一事业献出自己的一切力量。
    和平必将战胜战争！
