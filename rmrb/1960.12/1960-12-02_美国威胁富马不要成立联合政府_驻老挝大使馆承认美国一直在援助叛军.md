Washington News: State Department spokesman White made another rude intervention in the internal affairs of Laos when talking to reporters on November 30th. He said that "the policy of the United States, as in the past, is to encourage all non-communist elements in Laos to promote the unity of their country." White also said that the US government "frequently discusses" the Laotian situation with representatives of the British and French governments.

The US news agency United Press International reported on White's above remarks on the 30th, claiming that the US State Department "strongly believes" that if Phouma implements the proposal to include the Lao Patriotic Front in the coalition government, "this country will be in serious danger of eventually being controlled by the Communists," attempting to put pressure on the Phouma government to prevent the formation of such a coalition government.

On the same day, a UPI dispatch from Vientiane admitted that the United States has been supporting the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group with "military aid" and has stopped paying "aid" to the Laotian government. The news agency quoted a spokesman for the US Embassy in Laos as saying that the US "is continuing to provide aid to the garrisons in the provinces of Laos, although many of these garrisons do not accept orders from Vientiane (the Royal Lao Government)." UPI also wrote: "US aid to Prince Phouma's neutralist government in Laos has been delayed for two months without payment."

    美国威胁富马不要成立联合政府
    驻老挝大使馆承认美国一直在援助叛军
    新华社1日讯　华盛顿消息：国务院发言人怀特11月30日对记者谈话时又发表粗暴干涉老挝内政的言论，他说，“美国的政策像过去一样是鼓励老挝国内一切非共产党分子促进他们国家的团结”。怀特还说，美国政府“经常同英国和法国政府的代表商讨”老挝局势。
    美国通讯社合众国际社30日在报道怀特上述谈话时宣传，美国国务院“强烈地认为”，如果富马贯彻把老挝爱国战线党包括在联合政府中的建议的话，“这个国家将有到头来为共产党控制的严重危险”，企图以此来对富马政府施加压力，阻止成立这样的联合政府。
    同一天，合众国际社从万象发出的一条消息承认，美国一直以“军事援助”支持富米·诺萨万叛乱集团，同时已经停止支付给予老挝政府的“援助”。这家通讯社引用美国驻老挝大使馆发言人的话说，美国向老挝“各省驻军提供美援的工作一直在继续进行，尽管这些驻军有许多不接受万象（老挝王国政府）的命令”。合众国际社同时写道：“美国对富马亲王的中立主义的老挝政府的援助已经拖迟两个月之久而没有支付了”。
