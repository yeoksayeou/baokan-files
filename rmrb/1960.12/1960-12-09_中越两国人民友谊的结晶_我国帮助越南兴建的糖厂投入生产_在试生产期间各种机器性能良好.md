Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 5th. A sugar mill in the Viet Tri industrial zone of northern Vietnam officially went into production on November 24th after more than a month of trial production. In the past few days, the sugar mill has already produced its first batch of over one hundred tons of high-quality granulated sugar. This sugar mill was built with Chinese assistance. During the trial production period, the performance of various machines was normal and good.

To ensure a sufficient supply of raw materials, the sugar mill has established close ties with agricultural cooperatives. Recently, it supplied farmers with 440 tons of sugarcane seedlings and a large number of interest-free loans, expanding the sugarcane planting area by more than 100 mu. In addition, the factory has sent cadres to help farmers improve sugarcane planting techniques.

Another factory aided by China, the Viet Tri Chemical Plant, has also been basically completed recently and is currently undergoing testing, preparing to officially go into production early next year.

Construction of the chemical plant began in October last year. During the construction period, cadres and workers overcame many difficulties in design and construction, and successfully completed the construction task.

After the chemical plant officially goes into production, it can supply a large amount of chlorine, caustic soda, and nylon powder to the factories in the new industrial zone.

    中越两国人民友谊的结晶
    我国帮助越南兴建的糖厂投入生产
    在试生产期间各种机器性能良好
    新华社河内5日电　越南北方越池工业区的一座糖厂，经过一个多月的试生产，在11月24日正式投入生产。几天来，这家糖厂已经生产了第一批一百多吨优质的白砂糖。这家糖厂是由中国援助而兴建起来的。在试生产期间，各种机器的性能都很正常和良好。
    为了保证有充分的原料供应，这家糖厂同农业社建立了紧密的联系。最近，它供给农民四百四十吨蔗种和大批无息贷款，使甘蔗的种植面积扩大一百多亩。此外，这家工厂还派干部帮助农民改进种植甘蔗的技术。
    由中国援助的另一家工厂——越池化工厂，也在最近基本建成，目前正在进行试验，准备明年初正式投入生产。
    这家化工厂是去年10月开工兴建的。在建设期间，干部和工人克服了许多设计和施工方面的困难，胜利完成了建设任务。
    这家化工厂正式投入生产后，可以向新工业区的各工厂供应大批氯、烧碱和尼龙粉。
