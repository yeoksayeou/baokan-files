Implementing a Method of Tiered, Regular and Irregular Centralized Training
Jin southeast Region Vigorously Trains Grassroots Cadres

(Our Report) The Jin southeast Regional Committee, County Committees, and Commune Committees of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province, adhere to the system of regularly training cadres above production team leader level, greatly improving the management level of grassroots cadres.

Since the realization of rural people's communes, collectivized production and collectivized life urgently require improving the leadership ability of grassroots cadres. In response to this situation, four forms have been adopted to train and cultivate grassroots cadres: First, specialized business management schools are established at all levels for year-round training; second, in accordance with the characteristics of the agricultural off-season, regular tiered centralized training is implemented; third, in accordance with the characteristics of the busy agricultural season, temporary and irregular short-term centralized training is conducted at the county and commune levels; fourth, cadres are organized to visit and study through on-site meetings.

Over the past three years, the Party Committees at the regional, county and commune levels have used these methods to regularly conduct tiered centralized training. Four hundred and fourteen thousand grassroots cadres, including deputy secretaries and directors, accountants of communes and management districts, and production team leaders, work point recorders, and canteen administrators, have been trained. Through annual tiered centralized training, the policy and ideological level and management ability of the broad masses of grassroots cadres have been comprehensively and systematically improved. Eight hundred and ninety-seven model financial pacesetter units, three thousand nine hundred and twenty-one model accountants and work point recorders, five thousand four hundred model production team leaders, and six thousand model canteen administrators have emerged. The entire region has trained a large number of new forces, replenishing the ranks of grassroots cadres in a timely manner. According to a survey of Wuxiang, Qin County and Huguan three counties, after local recruitment, democratic selection, and regular centralized training, not only were the vacancies for management district directors and accountants filled, but 97.5% of the cadres were able to competently perform their duties. With the rapid improvement of the policy level and professional ability of the broad masses of grassroots cadres, the operation and management of the people's communes have been greatly improved, promoting the increase of labor productivity.

On the basis of tiered regular centralized training, the Party Committees at all levels have made great efforts to consolidate the training results and continuously improve them in practical work. The methods are: First, specialized departments and accounting counselors at each level, from the special zone to the commune, adopt a combination of key training and mobile counseling to help grassroots cadres solve difficult problems in practical work, consolidate what they have learned in training, and solve problems in practical work; second, conduct regular activities to organize the exchange of experience, so as to achieve experienced hands leading novices, and experienced hands teaching apprentices, mutual teaching and mutual learning, and common improvement; third, establish financial accounting night schools at the management district level to continue to organize cadres such as management district accountants, team work point recorders, keepers, and clerks to study regularly; fourth, regularly conduct large-scale inspections, summaries, and evaluations from top to bottom, and widely promote advanced experience; fifth, insert red flags, establish benchmarks, learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and carry out in-depth competition activities to further inspire the confidence and determination of the broad masses of grassroots cadres to do a good job in operation and management.

    实行分级定期和不定期集中训练的办法
    晋东南地区大力培养基层干部
    本报讯　中共山西省晋东南地委、县委和公社党委，坚持定期集训生产队长以上干部的制度，大大提高了基层干部的经营管理水平。
    实现农村人民公社化以后，集体化生产和集体化生活，迫切要求提高基层干部的领导能力。针对这种情况，采取了四种形式训练和培养基层干部：一、各级设专门的经营管理学校，常年训练；二、适应农闲季节的特点，实行定期分级集训；三、适应农忙季节的特点，以县、公社为单位进行临时性的、不定期的短期集中训练；四、通过现场会议，组织干部参观学习。
    三年来，全区由地、县和公社党委，运用这些办法，定期分级集中训练；公社、管理区的正副书记、主任、会计和生产队长、记工员、食堂事务长等基层干部四十一万四千人次。通过每年分级集中训练，全面系统地提高了广大基层干部的政策思想水平和经营管理能力，涌现出财务模范标兵单位八百九十七个，各种模范会计员、记工员三千九百二十一名，模范生产队长五千四百名和模范食堂事务长六千名。全区通过训练培养出大批新生力量，及时充实了基层干部队伍。据武乡、沁县、壶关三个县的调查，经过就地取材、民主选拔、定期集训培养之后，不仅把管理区主任、会计的缺额配备齐全，而且97.5％的干部都能胜任自己的工作。随着广大基层干部的政策水平和业务能力的迅速提高，大大改善了人民公社的经营管理工作，促进了劳动生产率的提高。
    在分级定期集训的基础上，各级党委狠抓巩固训练成果，在实际工作中不断加以继续培养提高。其办法是：一、从专区到公社每级专管部门和会计辅导人员，采取重点培养和巡回辅导相结合的方法，帮助基层干部解决实际工作中的疑难问题，巩固在训练中所学到的东西，解决实际工作中的问题；二、定期活动，组织交流经验，从而做到熟手带生手、老手带徒弟，互教互学，共同提高；三、以管理区为单位建立财务会计夜校班，继续组织管理区会计、各队记工员、保管员、事务员等干部定期学习。四、定期开展由上而下的大检查，大总结，大评比，广泛推广先进经验；五、插红旗、树标兵、学先进、赶先进，深入开展竞赛活动，进一步鼓舞广大基层干部搞好经营管理工作的信心和决心。
