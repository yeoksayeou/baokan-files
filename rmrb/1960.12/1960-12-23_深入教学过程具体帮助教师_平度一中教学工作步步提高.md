Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, December 22nd: The Party branch of Pingdu No. 1 Middle School in Shandong Province, while consistently focusing on ideological and political work and attending to livelihood, vigorously improves its leadership style and adopts effective measures to deeply enter the teaching process, discover problems, and solve problems, thereby steadily improving the teaching work.

Recently, school Party branch leaders have directed teachers to improve teaching from multiple perspectives. At the same time, they have organized school leaders to specifically divide labor, in addition to preparing lessons, listening to lectures, and checking homework with teachers, they also personally give lectures. In order to improve the quality of teaching, the Party branch, based on a thorough understanding of the professional level of teachers in various subjects, adopts various forms to help them improve their political and professional skills. For teachers who have difficulty teaching, in addition to organizing them to systematically study their profession, they also organize experienced teachers to "mentor apprentices," providing a series of guidance from professional study, lesson preparation to lecturing and checking teaching effectiveness. For general teachers, they lead them to strengthen teaching research work, organize teaching demonstrations, and check every teaching link.

The result of the school Party branch's deep involvement in teaching is that the teaching content and teaching methods of various subjects have been greatly improved.

    据新华社济南22日电　山东省平度县第一中学党支部，在经常抓紧思想政治工作、抓好生活的同时，大力改进领导作风，采取有力措施，深入教学过程，发现问题，解决问题，使教学工作步步提高。
    近来，学校党支部领导教师从多方面着手，改进教学。同时，组织学校领导干部具体分工，除和教师一起备课、听课、检查作业外，并亲自讲课。为了提高教学质量，党支部在深入了解各科教师业务水平的基础上，分别采用各种形式来帮助他们提高政治、业务。对于教课有困难的教师，除组织他们系统学习业务外，并组织有经验的教师“带徒弟”，从业务学习、备课到讲课、检查教学效果，作一系列辅导。对一般教师，则领导他们加强教学研究工作、组织教学观摩、检查每个教学环节。
    学校党支部深入抓教学的结果，使各科教学内容、教学方法都有很大改进。
