Xinhua News Agency, 11th: According to a TASS report from New York on the 10th, American black organizations such as the "African Women's Cultural Association," "Harlem Writers Guild," "Voices of Afro-American Writers and Artists," and the "Committee for Free Congo" recently wrote to the UN Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council, angrily protesting against the puppet of the colonialists in the Congo for illegally arresting and abusing the Prime Minister of the Republic of the Congo, Lumumba, and dissolving the Congolese parliament.

The letter stated: "We demand the immediate release of Lumumba, the legally elected Prime Minister of the Republic of the Congo, the convening of the Congolese Parliament, the immediate disarmament of the Mobutu gang, and the expulsion of all Belgian troops from the Congo."

The letter continued, "The vast majority of Americans of African descent share our sentiments."

The "Committee for African Liberation" severely condemned the United States' shameful policy in the Congo.

On the 10th, the "African Women's Cultural Association" also held a demonstration in front of the United Nations building in New York. Demonstrators held signs that read: "The United Nations should drive the Belgians out of the Congo!" "Down with Mobutu!" "Release Lumumba and convene the Congolese Parliament!" "The United States is the enemy of freedom!"

In an editorial, the *Worker's Weekly* called on all honest Americans to protest against the actions of the U.S. State Department, which plays a major role in the Congo disaster.
