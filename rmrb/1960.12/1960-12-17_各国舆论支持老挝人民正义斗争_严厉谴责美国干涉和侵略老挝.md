(Comprehensive Report) Xinhua News Agency reports: Public opinion in various countries has condemned the United States' crimes of openly interfering in Laos and supports the Lao people's patriotic and just struggle.

    TASS Commentary Reveals
    U.S. Rampantly Supports Rebel Offensive
    TASS of the Soviet Union published a commentary on the 13th, exposing that the United States not only recruited the Nosavan rebel army and supplied them with weapons and ammunition, but also instructed the Thai authorities to provide their territory for the rebels to use. It said that the United States' interference is not limited to extensive military support for the rebels; the United States is also attempting to confront the legitimate government of Laos with a divided puppet regime established in Savannakhet.
    The commentary said that the situation in Laos has reached such a stage that the question is now being raised with particular acuteness: whether Laos is to become a neutral and independent country or a place of civil war with the danger of escalating into a larger conflict.
    The commentary pointed out that the participants of the Geneva Conference on Indochina and all peace-loving people should take urgent measures to stop the United States' interference in Laos and dispel the clouds hanging over the country. The interests of peace require such immediate action. Hesitation and delay will only benefit those who disrupt peace in the region.

    Hungarian *Népszabadság* Points Out
    The United States Wants to Take Laos Away from Neutrality
    The Hungarian newspaper *Népszabadság* published a commentary on the 14th in its international section entitled "The United States Openly Interferes in Laos," pointing out that the purpose of the anti-revolutionary government of the Nosavan group, supported by the United States, established in Savannakhet, is to restore the pro-American government overthrown by Captain Kong Le on August 9, which subjected the country to the U.S. aggression plan.
    The commentary emphasized that the current situation in Laos contains the danger of developing into a larger war. The direct cause of this danger is the direct interference in Lao events by the United States, Thailand, and other countries of the Southeast Asia Group. The commentary pointed out that U.S. imperialism is determined to take Laos away from its neutral policy and attach it to the United States.

    Cambodian Radio Points Out
    Traitors Have No Right to Overthrow the Phouma Government
    Cambodian Radio said on the evening of the 14th that the legitimate government of Laos can refuse to recognize the newly formed "government" of the Phoumi Nosavan group because the Lao King's edict was made under the coercion of the rebels. The radio also pointed out that the rebels' parliament has no right to overthrow the legitimate government of Phouma because Prime Minister Phouma has not submitted his resignation.
    The radio pointed out that the rebels' attack on Vientiane is linked to foreign countries, and this activity seriously violates the legitimate government of Phouma.

    Myanmar National United Front Issues Statement
    The Lao Issue Can Only Be Resolved by the Lao People Themselves
    The Myanmar National United Front issued a statement on the 15th, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys for interfering in Laos' internal affairs.
    The statement said, "As a result of this interference by members of the military organization controlled by the U.S. imperialists, Laos has become a battlefield." The statement stated that the Presidium of the Myanmar National United Front supports the legitimately established sole government of Laos—the government of Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma. The statement said: The problem of Laos can only be resolved by the Lao people themselves in accordance with their right to make their own decisions.

    Indonesian *Harian Rakjat* Points Out
    The United States Must Be Held Responsible for the Lao Civil War
    The Indonesian *Harian Rakjat* published an editorial on the 16th, condemning the United States for its naked interference in Laos, and pointed out that the United States must be held responsible for the Lao civil war.
    The editorial said that the United States constantly provides and transports weapons to support the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group in Laos, and advises this group. It is precisely because of this interference by the United States that a civil war has broken out in Laos. The editorial pointed out that the United States' interference violates the Geneva Accords. The editorial said that the policy of peace and neutrality pursued by the Lao government headed by Phouma is being threatened and undermined by the United States.
    The editorial also called on Asian and African countries to stop the United States' interference in Laos.

    塔斯社发表评论揭露
    美国猖狂支持叛军进攻
    苏联塔斯社13日发表评论揭露美国不仅募集诺萨万叛乱军队并供给他们武器弹药，并且指示泰国当局把自己领土供叛军使用。它说，美国的干涉不仅限于对叛军的广泛军事支持，美国还企图以在沙湾拿吉成立的分裂的傀儡政权来同老挝的合法政府对抗。
    评论说，老挝局势已达到这样的阶段：目前特别尖锐地提出这一问题：老挝究竟要成为中立和独立的国家还是要成为具有变成更大规模的冲突的危险的内战的场所。
    评论指出，印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的参加者和一切爱好和平的人民都应该采取紧急措施，来制止美国对老挝的干涉，驱散笼罩着这个国家的乌云。和平的利益要求采取这种毫不延缓的行动。犹豫不决和行动迟缓只会有利于扰乱这一地区安宁的人。
    匈《人民自由报》指出
    美国要使老挝脱离中立
    匈牙利《人民自由报》14日在国际版上发表的题为“美国公开干涉老挝”的评论指出，在沙湾拿吉成立的由美国支持的诺萨万集团的反革命政府的目的，是想复辟8月9日为贡勒大尉所推翻的、使国家受美国侵略计划支配的亲美政府。
    评论强调指出：目前老挝局势包含着发展成为范围更大的战争的危险。这一危险的直接起因是：美国、泰国和东南亚集团其他国家在对老挝事件进行直接干涉。评论指出：美帝国主义一心想使老挝脱离中立政策而附属于美国。
    柬埔寨电台指出
    叛国分子无权推翻富马政府
    柬埔寨电台14日晚上说，老挝的合法政府可以拒绝承认富米·诺萨万集团新组成的“政府”，因为老挝国王的诏令是在叛乱分子胁迫下作出的。这家电台还指出：叛乱分子的议会无权推翻富马的合法政府，由于富马首相没有提出辞呈。
    这家电台指出，叛乱分子对万象的进攻是同外国有联系的，这种活动严重地侵犯了富马合法政府。
    缅甸民族团结阵线发表声明
    老挝问题只能由老挝人自己解决
  缅甸民族团结阵线15日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义者及其仆从干涉老挝内政。
    声明说，“由于美帝国主义者控制的军事组织的成员国所进行的这种干涉的结果，老挝已经变成战场。”声明表示，缅甸民族团结阵线主席团支持合法建立的唯一老挝政府——梭发那·富马首相的政府。声明说：老挝的问题只能由老挝人民自己根据他们自己作出决定的权利来解决。
    印度尼西亚《东星报》指出
    美国必须对老挝内战负责
    印度尼西亚《东星报》16日发表社论谴责美国对老挝进行赤裸裸的干涉，并且指出，美国必须对老挝的内战负责。
    社论说，美国不断地提供和运输武器来支持老挝的富米·诺萨万叛乱集团，并为这一集团出谋献策。正是由于美国的这种干涉，才使老挝发生内战。社论指出，美国的干涉是违反日内瓦协议的。社论说，以富马为首的老挝政府执行的和平中立政策正受到美国的威胁和破坏。
    社论还呼吁亚非国家制止美国对老挝的干涉。
