    On the Nationalization of Literary Works
    ——An Interview with Comrade Liang Bin
    *Wenyi Bao* Reporter

    The reporter from this publication interviewed Comrade Liang Bin on the issue of the nationalization of literary works, hoping he would discuss relevant questions based on his own creative practice. He graciously fulfilled our request.

    Comrade Liang Bin said: The more our socialist literary and artistic undertaking develops, the more urgently it demands the nationalization of literary works. Only in this way can literary works become fresh, lively, and popular with the broad masses. China's literary and artistic undertaking has accumulated rich creative experience over thousands of years, forming its own unique national forms. Socialist literature should inherit the national tradition and create new national forms that adapt to socialist content.

    Solving the problem of national form cannot be done by focusing solely on form. It inevitably involves content. Nor can it start only from definitions and concepts. It is best to start with creative practice. Let us consider this issue based on creative practice.

    The main issue of national form is language, followed by structure and composition.

    Literary language is the language of the broad masses of workers and peasants after refinement and processing. In the process of labor and production, in class struggle, and even in daily life, the broad masses of workers and peasants naturally reveal many expressive and lively vocabularies, which are valuable raw materials for literary language. Many classical Chinese literary works, especially *Water Margin* and other works depicting peasant life, have absorbed such raw materials of mass language. Even *Dream of the Red Chamber* and *Romance of the West Chamber*, which depict the lives of the aristocracy, use a large amount of mass language. Yuan Dynasty operas also used a lot of mass language. We can still absorb the essence of these languages today. In addition, the grammatical structure of the workers and peasants can also add fresh features to literary language and be easily accepted by the broad masses.

    However, in order to adapt to the ever-changing social life, although the basic vocabulary of our national language rarely changes, they still play a role in metabolism. The old, outdated parts that have lost their social significance will gradually be eliminated. At the same time, in order to depict the spirit of the new era and new heroic figures, it is necessary to absorb new, vivid mass language. This is an indispensable part of socialist literary language.

    In the process of nationalizing literary works, language plays a significant role. Without refined and processed literary language with strong generalization, without grammatical structures that are familiar to the broad masses, literary works cannot be further nationalized.

    We asked Comrade Liang Bin how he himself solves this problem. He said: I have taken both paths. I once recorded the language in my favorite classical literary works and the language in new literature since the May Fourth Movement. I also carefully paid attention to recording the mass language I loved in production struggles and class struggles. At the beginning, I took the first path, using the literary language used by others in the past as a basis and absorbing mass language to form the literary language I used. But it was not good, because it was relatively old and gave people a dull feeling when writing articles. Later, I turned back to using mass language as a basis and absorbed the good language from classical literature and new literature. As a result, the language appeared fresh and lively, making it easier to describe the lives of peasant masses and the spirit of new heroic figures and the new era. How can we learn mass language well? According to my personal experience, whether learning the language in classical literature and new literary works, or learning the language of workers and peasants, one cannot learn language in isolation, and one cannot separate the learning of vocabulary and grammar from vivid life and characters. The language problem cannot be solved in isolation. Language as a literary form is inseparable from content. Language is a product of labor life, and one must go to labor and struggle to learn it. One must delve into the life of the masses, possess the thoughts and feelings of the masses, and be familiar with the methods by which the masses express their thoughts and feelings in order to learn the language of the masses well.

    In addition to language, the local color of literary works is also an important issue for nationalization. Talking about this issue involves the content of literary works. To make the local color of literary works rich, one must first be familiar with the characters, their personalities, their psychological states, their spiritual outlook, their emotions and methods of expressing emotions, lifestyles, actions, and language, and be familiar with the geography, customs, and habits of a region. In this way, you can help write people from a certain place like people from that place, and people from a certain industry like people from that industry. The more detailed and vivid the spiritual outlook of the characters is written, the closer the work can get to nationalization. In addition, one must be familiar with the customs and habits of the people. Customs and habits are formed by the broad masses of people in long-term social life. The description of customs and habits can best give literary works a strong flavor of nationalization. Since I was a teenager, I have loved reading books describing the customs and habits of various ethnic groups. Every ethnic group and every era will have new customs and habits.

    If a writer wants to be familiar with more character personalities, local scenery, and local customs and habits, they can only earnestly implement the Party's instructions and take root in the masses for a long time. The "four togethers" working method can help us better solve this problem. The central government's placement of writers in local areas is an enlightened organizational measure. Based on my personal experience, the working method of taking a quick tour, going to the countryside for two or three months and returning to write short stories, or going to the countryside for a year and returning to write long stories, may be feasible for completing rush tasks; but in order to write works with deeper content and fundamentally solve the problem of nationalization of literary works, it is far from enough. According to the opinions of comrades engaged in Party and government work, it generally takes three years to understand the situation of a region and to understand the cadres and masses of a place. This is only for doing general work, which is still not enough for a writer.

    Perhaps some people will say, wouldn't this become "local literature," making it difficult for the broad readers to understand? No, historically speaking, strong local color does not prevent a work from becoming the wealth of the broad people. Huang Zhou's paintings depict the life of the Uyghur people, but people of all ethnic groups like them. *Liu Sanjie* depicts the struggle life of the Zhuang people, and hasn't it become the wealth of the people of the whole country now? Of course, if a writer only limits himself to the base of life, does not face the whole country, and does not care about the revolutionary cause of the whole Party and the whole people, and does not stand higher and look farther, this problem cannot be well solved. Only by combining the depth, height, and breadth of the writer's observation and understanding of life, can even if he writes about the life of an individual region, it can still become the literature of the whole people, and even be welcomed by foreign countries. This may also involve the issue of using dialects. Using dialects is to enrich literary language. Dialects can add local color to works, but works with local color do not necessarily have to use dialects completely. Strong local color is to write the spiritual outlook of the characters more deeply and make the works more nationalized.

    Character personality, spiritual outlook, customs and habits, and local scenery are content, but also form, a broad sense of form. The two complement each other and cannot be completely separated, and these contents can best be revealed in the form.

    Methods of expression, structure, and composition are also related to the nationalization of literary works. The traditional expression methods of Chinese classical novels are to express the identity, spiritual outlook, and personality of characters through their actions and dialogues. Foreign novels, on the other hand, mostly use narration and psychological descriptions to express the identity, spiritual outlook, and personality of characters. Chinese novels mostly use rough outlines to write character personalities. Foreign novels mostly use meticulous brushwork to describe character personalities. The former is popular with the Chinese people. I personally do not like to use the meticulous brushwork method, which easily leads to cumbersome narration and lengthy psychological descriptions. But I also feel that rough outlines are still insufficient, and some necessary narration and some detailed descriptions can be added to make up for the deficiencies.

    The problem of nationalizing literary works is an important issue in building our country's socialist literature. How can we nationalize our country's literary works? I think Comrade Zhou Yang has already solved this problem in his report at the Third National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, which is to be original! Everyone has their own life experiences, everyone has their own history of struggle, and everyone has their own political and cultural level. Under the leadership of the Party, everyone should explore a path of literary creation in practice, and everyone should have their own set of literary language—let a hundred flowers bloom.

    关于文学作品民族化问题
    ——梁斌同志访问记
    《文艺报》记者
    本刊记者就文学作品的民族化问题访问了梁斌同志，希望他根据自己的创作实践，谈谈有关的几个问题，承他满足了我们的要求。
    梁斌同志说：我们的社会主义文学艺术事业越是发展，也就更加迫切地要求文学作品的民族化。只有这样，文学作品才能成为新鲜活泼的、为广大群众喜闻乐见的东西。我国文学艺术事业，几千年来积累了丰富的创作经验，形成了自己特有的民族形式，社会主义文学应该继承民族传统，创造适应社会主义内容的新的民族形式。
    解决民族形式问题，不能就形式论形式，不可避免要涉及内容问题，也不能只从定义和概念出发，最好从创作实践谈起。让我们根据创作实践来考虑一下这个问题罢。
    民族形式的主要问题是语言问题，其次是章法和结构。
    文学语言是经过提炼加工的广大工农群众的语言。广大工农群众在劳动生产过程中，在阶级斗争中，以至在日常生活中，自然流露很多表达力很强的、新鲜活泼的语汇，那是文学语言的可贵的原料。许多中国古典文学作品，特别是《水浒传》和其他描写农民生活的作品，都吸收了群众语言这种原料。即便是描写贵族生活的《红楼梦》和《西厢记》，也运用了大量群众语言。元曲中也运用了不少的群众语言。这些语言中的精华部分，我们今天还可以吸收。此外，工农群众的语法结构，也能使文学语言增加新鲜的特色，为广大群众乐于接受。
    但是，为了适应日新月异的社会生活，我们民族语言的基本语汇虽然很少变化，但它们仍要起着新陈代谢的作用。旧的、过时的、失去了社会意义的部分，逐渐要被淘汰。同时，为了描写新的时代、新的英雄人物的精神面貌，必须吸收新的，活生生的群众语言。这是社会主义文学语言中不可缺少的部分。
    在文学作品民族化的过程中，语言起着很大作用。没有经过提炼加工的、概括性很强的文学语言，没有为广大群众所习惯的语法结构，就不能使文学作品进一步民族化。
    我们问梁斌同志他自己是怎样解决着这个问题的，他说：两条道路我都走过。我曾经记录过我所爱好的古典文学作品中的语言和“五四”以来新文学中的语言，也曾用心地在生产斗争中、在阶级斗争中注意记录我所爱好的群众语言。开始时，我是走了第一条道路，以过去别人用过的文学语言为基础，吸收群众语言，组成我所使用的文学语言。但是不好，因为它比较陈旧，写出文章来使人有暗淡的感觉。后来我又回转头来，以群众语言为基础，吸收古典文学及新文学中好的语言，结果，语言显得新鲜活泼，便于描写农民群众的生活，便于描写新的英雄人物和新时代的精神面貌了。怎样才能学好群众语言呢？根据我个人的体会，不论学习古典文学及新文学作品中的语言，或是学习工农群众的语言，都不能就语言学语言，不能把学习词汇、语法和活生生的生活与人物分离开来。语言问题不能孤立地解决，作为文学形式的语言离不开内容。语言是劳动生活的产物，必须到劳动、到斗争生活中去学习。必须深入群众生活，具备群众的思想感情，熟知群众表达思想感情的方法，才能学好群众的语言。
    除了语言以外，文学作品的地方色彩，对于民族化，也是个要紧的问题。谈到这个问题，就要涉及文学作品的内容。要使文学作品的地方色彩浓厚，首先要熟悉人物，熟悉人物性格，熟悉人物的心理状态、精神面貌，熟悉人物的感情和表达感情的方法，生活方式、动作和语言，熟悉一个地区的地理人情、风俗习惯。这样，就能够帮助你写什么地方的人像什么地方的人，写什么行业的人像什么行业的人。人物的精神面貌越是写得细致入微，维妙维肖，越能够使作品接近民族化。此外，要熟悉人民的风俗习惯。风俗习惯是广大人民在长期的社会生活中形成的，风俗习惯的描写最能使文学作品带上浓厚的民族化的味道。我从少年时候开始，最喜欢读描写各民族风俗习惯的书。每一个民族、每一个时代都会有新的风俗习惯出现。
    一个作家要想熟悉更多的人物性格、地方风光和地方风俗习惯，只有认真地执行党的指示，长期到群众中落户生根。“四同”的工作方法，可以帮助我们更好地解决这个问题，中央把作家下放到地方，是英明的组织措施，根据我个人的体会，走马观花、下乡两三个月回来写短篇，下放一年回来写长篇的工作方法，为了完成突击性的任务也许是可以的；但为了写出内容更深厚的作品和根本解决文学作品民族化的问题，就非常不够了。根据做党政工作的同志的意见，一般地了解一个地区的情况、了解一个地方的干部和群众，需要三年时间。这只是为着做一般工作，对于一个作家来说还是不够的。
    也许有人会说，这样一来，岂不成为《地方文学》，使广大读者不易了解了吗？不，从历史上看，浓厚的地方色彩，并不会妨碍一部作品成为广大人民的财富。黄胄同志的画，画的是维吾尔族的生活，可是各族人民都喜欢。《刘三姐》写的是僮族人民的斗争生活，现在不是成为全国人民的财富了吗？当然，假如一个作家单是把自己局限在生活基地，没有面向全国，关心全党全民的革命事业，不是站得高一些，望得远一些，这个问题也不能很好地解决。只有把作家观察理解生活的深度和高度、广度结合起来，那么，即使他写了个别地区的生活，同样能够成为全民的、甚至受到外国欢迎的文学。这里也可能涉及方言使用的问题。使用方言是为了丰富文学语言，方言可以加浓作品的地方色彩，但有地方色彩的作品，也不一定完全要使用方言。地方色彩浓厚，是为了更深刻地写出人物的精神面貌，使作品更加民族化。
    人物性格、精神面貌、风俗习惯、地方风光，是内容，也是形式，是广义的形式，两者互相为用，相辅相成，不能截然分开，而这些内容最能够透露到形式上来。
    表现方法、章法和结构，也是和文学作品的民族化有关系的。中国古典小说的传统表现方法，是通过人物的行动和对话来表现人物的身份、精神面貌和性格。外国小说则多用叙述和心理描写来表现人物的身份、精神面貌和性格。中国小说多用粗线条的勾勒来写人物性格。外国小说则多用工笔描写人物性格。前者为中国人民喜闻乐见。我个人不喜欢用工笔的方法，它容易流于繁琐的叙述和冗长的心理描写。但我又觉得粗笔勾勒还嫌不足，还可以加上一些必要的叙述和一些细致的描写，以补不足。
    文学作品民族化问题，是建设我国社会主义文学的一个重要问题。怎样才能使我国文学作品民族化，我觉得周扬同志在第三次文代大会上的报告中已经解决了这个问题，就是要独创！各人有各人的生活经验，各人有各人的斗争历史，各人有各人的政治文化水平。在党的领导下，各人要在实践中摸索一条文学创作的道路，各人要有各人使用的一套文学语言，——百花齐放。
