Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 1st: The Soviet Union launched its third spaceship into Earth satellite orbit on December 1st.

The Soviet Union’s third satellite-type spaceship (excluding the final stage of the carrier rocket) weighed 4,563 kilograms.

The spaceship carried experimental animals - the dogs "Little Bee" and "Little Fly". The cabin also contained other animals, insects and plants.

Observations of the animals were conducted through radio television equipment and telemetry systems, which sent physiological data describing the animals’ condition back to Earth.

A TASS communiqué regarding the third spaceship stated that its launch into Earth satellite orbit was carried out according to a scientific exploration work plan. According to the plan, a series of scientific explorations in cosmic space physics will be conducted via the scientific measurement equipment on the satellite-type spaceship.

The communiqué also stated that the third Soviet satellite-type spaceship is traveling in an elliptical orbit. According to preliminary materials obtained, the initial orbital period of the satellite spaceship is 88.6 minutes, with perigee and apogee altitudes of approximately 187.3 and 265 kilometers respectively. The angle of the orbit to the equatorial plane is 65 degrees.

The satellite-type spaceship is equipped with a "Signal" radio transmitter, which transmits at a frequency of 19.995 MHz, using alternating long and short telegraph signals.

The power supply for the spaceship's equipment is provided by chemical power sources and solar power sources.

According to available preliminary materials, all equipment on the satellite-type spaceship is operating normally. Ground radio technology stations are conducting regular observations of the Soviet Union’s third satellite-type spaceship.

The communiqué stated that the satellite-type spaceship will pass over the following locations at the following times (Moscow time): Rome - 13:31, Leningrad - 13:36, Paris - 15:01, Beijing - 15:20, London - 16:32, Hanoi - 16:55, Moscow - 18:10.

Xinhua News Agency, December 1st: The Preparatory Office of the Beijing Astronomical Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences successfully received the radio signals from the newly launched third Soviet satellite-type spaceship between 20:20 and 20:25 Beijing time tonight.

The spaceship signals received by the Preparatory Office of the Beijing Astronomical Observatory were very clear.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 1st: The Zijinshan Astronomical Observatory in Nanjing has clearly received the radio signals from the third Soviet satellite-type spaceship.

When the news of the successful launch of the third Soviet satellite-type spaceship reached the Zijinshan Astronomical Observatory in Nanjing, it immediately became lively, and everyone was excited and encouraged by this, and organized special personnel to be on duty for observation.

At 20:20 Beijing time, the observatory staff successfully received the signals emitted by the spaceship for the first time at a frequency of 19.995 MHz. The signal was very clear, and its characteristics were similar to those of the first two Soviet spaceships. The duration of the received signal was approximately twenty minutes. The signal has been officially recorded and will be further analyzed and processed.

    在宇宙空间物理学方面进行一系列科学考察
    苏联发射第三个宇宙飞船
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科1日讯：苏联12月1日把第三个宇宙飞船发射到地球卫星轨道。
    苏联第三个卫星式飞船（不算运载火箭的最后一级）重达四千五百六十三公斤。
    飞船上载有试验动物——小狗“小蜂”和“小蝇”。舱内还有其他动物、昆虫和植物。
    对动物的观察是通过无线电电视设备和遥测系统进行的，无线电电视设备和遥测系统向地球发回说明动物状态的生理数据。
    塔斯社发表的关于第三个宇宙飞船的公报说，把第三个宇宙飞船发射到地球卫星轨道是按照科学考察工作计划进行的。按照计划，将通过卫星式飞船上的科学测量设备在宇宙空间物理学方面进行一系列的科学考察。
    公报还说，第三个苏联卫星式飞船沿着椭圆形轨道运行。根据已获得的初步材料，卫星飞船沿轨道运行的初始周期是八八·六分钟，轨道的近地点和远地点的高度分别是大约一八七·三和二六五公里。轨道同赤道平面的交角是六十五度。
    卫星式飞船上设置有“讯号”无线电发射机，它的发报频率是一九·九九五兆周，使用长短交替的电报讯号。
    飞船设备的电源是化学电源和太阳能电源。
    根据现有的初步材料，卫星式飞船上的全部设备运转正常。地面无线电技术站对苏联第三个卫星式飞船正在定期进行观测。
    公报说，卫星式飞船经过各地时间（莫斯科时间）如下：罗马——十三时三十一分，列宁格勒——十三时三十六分，巴黎——十五时一分，北京——十五时二十分，伦敦——十六时三十二分，河内——十六时五十五分，莫斯科——十八时十分。
    新华社1日讯　中国科学院北京天文台筹备处在今晚北京时间二十点二十分到二十点二十五分，收听到了苏联刚刚发射的第三个卫星式飞船的无线电讯号。
    北京天文台筹备处所收听到的飞船讯号非常清晰。
    新华社南京1日电　南京紫金山天文台已清晰收听到苏联第三个卫星式飞船的无线电讯号。
    当苏联第三个卫星式飞船发射成功的消息传到南京紫金山天文台后，顿时热闹起来，大家莫不为此欢欣鼓舞，并组织专人值班进行观测。
    天文台的工作人员在北京时间二十点二十分时，在频率一九·九九五兆周处第一次成功地收听到了宇宙飞船所发出的讯号。讯号十分清晰，它的特征与苏联前两个宇宙飞船的讯号相似。收到讯号的延续时间约二十分钟。已将讯号作正式录音，并将作进一步地分析处理。
