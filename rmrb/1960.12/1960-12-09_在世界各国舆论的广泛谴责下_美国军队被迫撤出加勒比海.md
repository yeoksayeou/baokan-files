Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch from Washington: Under condemnation from world public opinion, U.S. President Eisenhower was forced to order the withdrawal of U.S. naval and air forces sent to the Caribbean Sea area.

White House Press Secretary Hagerty, when announcing this to reporters on the 7th, once again said deceptively that the United States sent troops at the "request" of the governments of Guatemala and Nicaragua. He said that the governments of Guatemala and Nicaragua now believe that the "state of emergency" that led them to make the "request" has passed. However, Hagerty refused to answer reporters' questions about whether the United States would send its armed forces to the Caribbean Sea area again in the future.

Since the U.S. government dispatched naval and air forces to the Caribbean Sea on November 17 to openly interfere in the internal affairs of Guatemala and Nicaragua and to carry out armed threats against Cuba, it has been widely condemned by world public opinion, especially in Latin American countries.

The U.S. government appears very passive and isolated in this measure to create tension.

    在世界各国舆论的广泛谴责下
    美国军队被迫撤出加勒比海
    新华社8日讯　华盛顿消息：在世界各国舆论的谴责下，美国总统艾森豪威尔不得不下令撤回派往加勒比海地区的美国海、空部队。
    白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂7日在对新闻记者宣布这件事时，再一次欺人地说什么美国是应危地马拉和尼加拉瓜政府的“请求”派出军队的。他说，现在危地马拉和尼加拉瓜政府认为导致它们提出“请求”的“紧急状态”已经过去了。但是哈格蒂拒绝回答记者提出的这样的问题：美国今后是否还会再派它的武装部队到加勒比海地区。
    自从美国政府11月17日出动海、空部队前往加勒比海公开干涉危地马拉和尼加拉瓜内政并对古巴进行武装威胁以来，一直遭到世界各国、特别是拉丁美洲国家的舆论的广泛谴责。
    美国政府在这一制造紧张局势的措施中显得十分被动和孤立。
