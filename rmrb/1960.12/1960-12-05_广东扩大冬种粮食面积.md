Xinhua News Agency report: Guangdong Province's people's communes and production brigades are actively planting and expanding winter planting earlier than usual, making this winter's planting earlier, more extensive, and better than in previous years. According to recent statistics, the province's winter planting area has reached over 15 million mu, with grain crops accounting for more than 70%.

Fully utilizing the superior natural conditions that allow for three harvests a year, and truly treating winter planting as a third season of grain production, is an important measure for Guangdong Province to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production. As early as before September, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee took various measures to strengthen the labor force on the agricultural front lines and strengthen the leadership at the grassroots level in rural areas. In addition, the policy of three-level ownership based on the team was further implemented, and the "three guarantees and one reward" plan formulated through mass discussions was implemented at the team level, fully mobilizing the production enthusiasm of teams and the masses. This broke the past habit of winter planting only after the autumn harvest, and launched a competition centered on wasteland reclamation and intercropping to exceed the winter planting area and exceed contracted production targets.

    广东扩大冬种粮食面积
    据新华社讯　广东省各地人民公社和生产大队积极提早冬种和扩大冬种，使冬种比历年都种得早，种得多，种得好。据最近统计，全省冬种面积已达一千五百多万亩，其中粮食作物占70％以上。
    充分利用一年能种三熟的优越自然条件，把冬种真正当作第三季粮食生产来抓，是广东省大办农业、大办粮食的一项重要措施。早在9月以前，中共广东省委就采取各种措施，增强农业第一线的劳力，加强了农村基层的领导力量。此外，又进一步贯彻了以队为基础的三级所有制的政策，同时把通过群众讨论制订的“三包一奖”方案落实到小队，充分调动了小队和群众的生产积极性，打破了过去到秋收后才冬种的习惯，开展了以开荒扩种和间种套种为中心的冬种超面积、超包产的竞赛。
