A New Exploration of Nationalizing Choirs
　　Wang Zhenya
The Central Philharmonic Society Choir and the Beijing Quyi Troupe have jointly performed several Quyi choir concerts at the Qianmenwai Small Theater and the Beijing Theater, which have been warmly welcomed by the audience. Among the programs is a group of choir pieces written with Quyi and opera music, which have a very distinct national style, rich expressiveness, and novel form, representing a step forward in the nationalization and mass appeal of choirs.
The performed choir pieces included six in total. The Danxian (single-stringed instrument) choir piece "Monument to the People's Heroes," the Cantonese Nanyin choir piece "New Look of the Countryside," and the Henan Opera choir piece "Xu Xuehui" are programs that the Central Philharmonic Society has been creating in recent years while studying Quyi and opera, and have been performed many times. The two pieces for soloist and choir adapted from selections from the Quyi operas "Bitter Vegetable Flowers" and "Yanjia Tan" are new works. The Danxian choir piece "Long Live" is a work by the Beijing Quyi Troupe. The last three programs were jointly performed by the Central Philharmonic Society and the Beijing Quyi Troupe. The Central Philharmonic Society has been gradually deepening its study of national music, from learning Quyi, writing Quyi, performing Quyi to jointly performing with Quyi workers, and the road to nationalization has become increasingly firm.
These choir pieces not only absorb certain materials from Quyi (opera), but also accept Quyi (opera) as a whole, from the structure of the entire piece, the lyrics, the melody, the performance techniques, and the singing style. From the Henan Opera choir piece "Xu Xuehui," you can hear the slow tempo, Er-ba board, and flowing board of Henan Opera. The connection of beats basically conforms to the habits of Henan Opera singing, and a Henan Opera-style band is also used. From the Danxian choir piece "Monument to the People's Heroes," you can hear tunes such as "Qutou," "Nanluo Beigu," and "Pomegranate Flower." The two soloist and choir pieces written with selections from Quyi operas relatively completely retain the original music of the Quyi operas. The choir serves as a foil, helping the soloists to better express the characters in the play. The soloist is Comrade Wei Xikui, and the band is the Beijing Quyi Troupe's band. The result of comprehensively absorbing Quyi and opera music is that these choir pieces are national in both overall style and detail. But they are also new and choralized, and sound intimate, familiar, and easy to understand everywhere.
After the new opera comprehensively learned, inherited, and utilized the opera, which has a similar nature to it in our country's traditional art, it has developed rapidly; there are many good plays and vigorous creations recently. In China's traditional art, Quyi is the main means of expression through singing. Quyi has accumulated a wealth of experience in expressing life, countless musical treasures, high technology, and a wide mass base. It is generally not as short as folk songs and can use large forms to express huge content and complex themes. The choral art, which uses singing as the main means of expression, may have rapid development if it grasps the link of comprehensively and deeply learning Quyi, which has a similar nature to it, can further nationalize this foreign form that has been circulating in our country for about half a century, attract more listeners (especially farmers), and create a more prosperous new situation.
In these choir pieces, it can already be seen that after the combination of choir and Quyi, the expressive power of the choir is not destroyed or reduced. On the contrary, it absorbs many of the advantages and characteristics of Quyi, greatly expanding the expressive range of the choir.
For example, Quyi is good at narration, good at combining narration and expressing emotions. During the narration, there are still pleasant melodies and a relatively clear musical structure. The choir is relatively weak in this aspect. There is such a passage in the Danxian choir piece "Long Live": "The whole party and the whole people are running agriculture in a big way, marching to the forefront of production, and we must vigorously support agricultural production. Agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers are mass-produced, and iron cattle must run on the fertile plains of the motherland..." General composers find it very difficult to write a choir piece when they encounter such lyrics. However, it is very natural to sing it with the Jinqian Lianhualuo tune, the words are clear, very optimistic, humorous, and not boring.
Quyi is good at combining the first person and the third person, using various techniques to delicately describe characters from various different angles. The choir is not good at this aspect. In the two choir pieces written with selections from the Quyi operas "Bitter Vegetable Flowers" and "Yanjia Tan," not only is the solo singing used to portray the characters' moods, but the choir also plays a great role in portraying the characters' inner emotions. In the Henan Opera choir piece "Xu Xuehui," Xu Xuehui's inner thoughts and activities after discovering the enemy, her heroic inner monologue to resist the enemy and protect state property, and her fight with the bandits, being wounded, etc., the rapid conversion of different contents, without the Henan Opera's Er-ba board and flowing board-style tunes, it is difficult to express it so flexibly, the emotions are difficult to be so sincere, and the musical language is difficult to be so easy to understand.
After the choir obtains these strengths of Quyi, the world becomes wider and the expressiveness is greatly improved.
After combining with Quyi, each choir piece has its own unique style that is connected to the style of a Quyi (opera) genre. The problems of generalization and dullness are gone. For example, the lyrics of the Cantonese Nanyin choir piece "New Look of the Countryside" are not very characteristic. Because Nanyin music gives this piece a distinct style, its artistic appeal and artistic expressiveness are improved, and the actors can attract the audience as soon as they open their mouths. The remaining choir pieces are all equally distinctive.
Writing a choir piece with Quyi and opera music, which was originally dominated by solo singing, is not a simple task. Composers must deeply study Quyi and opera, must deeply know the characteristics of the choir, and must give full play to their creativity in order to do this work well. These pieces successfully combine Quyi and opera music with the choir form, retaining the original style of Quyi and opera music, and also giving play to the characteristics of the choir, Quyi and opera music are choralized. In the Danxian choir pieces "Monument to the People's Heroes" and "Long Live," the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people in praising the heroes in the revolutionary struggle and cheering for the three red flags is expressed. The momentum is huge, and it is filled with the mass revolutionary emotions. If the original Danxian music is used to express this emotion, there are more difficulties. After Danxian music is used in the choir, it has undergone a qualitative change. The ending of the selection from the Quyi opera "Bitter Vegetable Flowers" uses a strong choir to express Juanzi's firm confidence in victory and her high-spirited revolutionary will; it can only be done so strongly with the addition of the choir, and there are certain limitations if only solo singing is used. In the selection from the Quyi opera "Yanjia Tan," the complex mood of Zuo Guilan, a young lady from an official family, who is alone in thinking about her fiancé Yan Jingan, is expressed by interweaving many choir parts and solo singing in a call-and-response manner, which is more effective than expressing this mood with only one part, and the complex mood is more sincere. Many things that solo singing is good at expressing, such as the scattered board and delicate and complex long dragging tones in Quyi and opera, are not used much in the choir.
Inheriting Quyi and opera in sets, and then choralizing the inherited things, the result is the creation of a new choir variety. It is a native flower with a strong fragrance and completely nationalized. From these choir pieces, it can already be seen that its vitality is very strong and its expression range is very wide. It can express historical themes and modern revolutionary themes; it can chant objects and write about people; it is good at narration and also good at expressing emotions. Hundreds of Quyi and opera genres in national art provide it with an inexhaustible source of art. As long as it is carefully cultivated, it has great development prospects.
The emergence of Quyi and opera choirs will inevitably promote the reform and development of Quyi and opera. The mass and revolutionary spirit of the times expressed in "Monument to the People's Heroes" and "Long Live" will have a good impact on Danxian and other Quyi genres. Quyi opera, Henan Opera, etc. can all find here how to develop the choir of this genre with the music of this genre.
The actors of the Central Philharmonic Society Choir deeply studied the Quyi and opera of various places, sang Quyi programs in the dialects of various places, and improved their ability to handle language. They can pronounce words clearly and vividly. After learning the very vivid characteristics of Quyi and opera expressions, they sing with more emotion and are more touching than in the past. In some small programs, some Quyi and opera movements are absorbed, which makes the performance style very vivid and not rigid. The comrades of the Beijing Quyi Troupe have also absorbed some beneficial things in the process of cooperating with the Central Philharmonic Society. For example, Comrade Wei Xikui has increased his experience in cooperating with the choir; the comrades of the band not only have solid skills in their performance, but also have a clearer purpose in the handling of strength, speed, and rigidity and softness, and further combine the performance with the expression of thoughts and emotions. The combination of new and old, the combination of local and foreign will promote the development of both sides, and there are many benefits.
Most of these choir works are works by amateur composers. Few professional composers have participated in the work, and no professional writers and poets have participated in the work. If more people can pay attention to this work, more achievements can be made. After deeply studying Quyi and opera and gaining certain creative experience, composers and poets can all do a lot, and they can be bolder and more original than these works; they can also find more ways to use Quyi and opera in choirs; the expressiveness of the choir can also be greatly improved; they can also choose more themes and write choir works with higher ideological and artistic quality.
The Central Philharmonic Society once jointly performed Beethoven's choral symphony with several literary and art groups in Beijing, which became a sensational event. Now the Central Philharmonic Society and the Beijing Quyi Troupe have jointly performed a Quyi choir concert, which should also be regarded as a major event with far-reaching influence on the development of choral art in our country. Congratulations to the success of the comrades of the Orchestra and Quyi Troupe, and hope they will achieve greater success.

    合唱民族化的新探索
    王震亚
    中央乐团合唱队和北京曲艺团连续在前门外小剧场和北京剧场合演了几场曲艺合唱音乐会，受到听众的热烈欢迎。节目中有一组用曲艺和戏曲音乐写成的合唱曲，民族风格十分鲜明，表现力丰富，形式新颖，在合唱的民族化和群众化方面向前跨进了一步。
    演出的合唱曲一共六首，单弦合唱《人民英雄纪念碑》、广东南音合唱《农村新面貌》和河南梆子合唱《徐学惠》，是中央乐团近年来学习曲艺、戏曲过程中陆续创作的节目，已经演出过许多场。用曲艺剧《苦菜花》和《阎家滩》选曲编成的两首领唱与合唱曲是新作品。单弦合唱《三呼万岁》是北京曲艺团的作品。后面三个节目是中央乐团和北京曲艺团联合演出的。中央乐团从学曲艺、写曲艺、演曲艺到和曲艺工作者联合演出，在学习民族音乐方面一步步深入，民族化的道路越走越坚定。
    这些合唱曲，不仅仅是吸取曲艺（戏曲）中的某些素材，而是把曲艺（戏曲）作为一个整体，自整个曲子的结构、唱词、曲调、表现手法和演唱风格等都接受下来。从河南梆子合唱《徐学惠》中可以听得出河南梆子的慢板、二八板和流水板，板眼的连接基本上符合河南梆子唱腔中的习惯，还用了河南梆子式的乐队。从单弦合唱《人民英雄纪念碑》里可以听到《曲头》、《南锣北鼓》、《石榴花》等曲牌。两个用曲艺剧选曲写的领唱和合唱曲，都较完整地保留了曲艺剧原来的音乐，合唱是作为衬托、帮助独唱演员更好地表现剧中人物，独唱演员是魏喜奎同志，乐队是北京曲艺团的乐队。全面吸收曲艺、戏曲音乐的结果，使这些合唱曲由整体到细部都是民族的。但又是新的、合唱化了的，听起来处处亲切、熟悉、容易理解。
    新歌剧全面学习、继承、运用我国传统文艺中和它性质相近的戏曲以后，得到了迅速的发展；近来好戏很多，创作很旺盛。我国传统的艺术中以演唱作为主要表现手段的就是曲艺。在曲艺中积累了很丰富的表现生活的经验，有数不清的音乐财富，有很高的技术，有很广泛的群众基础。它一般不像民歌那么短小，能够用大的形式表现巨大的内容和复杂的题材。以歌唱作为主要表现手段的合唱艺术，抓住了全面、深入学习和它性质相近的曲艺这个环节，就可能有突飞猛进的发展，可以使合唱这种在我国已流传约半个世纪的外来形式，进一步民族化，吸引更多的听众（特别是农民），出现更繁荣的新局面。
    在这几首合唱曲中已可以看出合唱与曲艺结合以后，不是破坏了、降低了合唱的表现力，相反是吸收了曲艺的许多优点和特长，大大地扩展了合唱的表现范围。
    例如曲艺是擅长叙事的，善于把叙述和抒发情感结合起来，在叙述的时候仍有动听的曲调和比较清晰的音乐结构。合唱在这一方面就比较弱。单弦合唱《三呼万岁》中有这样一段唱词：“全党全民大办粮食，走向生产第一线，要把那农业生产大力来支援，农业机械、化学肥料大生产，铁牛要奔跑在祖国的沃野大平原……”一般作曲家在写合唱时遇见这种词是很棘手的。但是，用金钱莲花落这个牌子唱就很自然，字字清晰，很乐观、有风趣、不枯燥。
    曲艺善于把第一人称和第三人称结合起来，用各种手法，自各个不同角度细腻地描写人物，合唱在这一方面并不见长。在用曲艺剧《苦菜花》和《阎家滩》选曲写的两首合唱中，不仅用领唱刻划人物的心情，合唱在刻划人物内心情感方面也起了很大作用。在河南梆子合唱《徐学惠》里面，徐学惠发现敌人以后，她准备抵抗敌人保护国家财产内心的思想活动；她的英雄气概的内心自白以及她和匪徒搏斗、负伤等等不同的内容的迅速转换，不用河南梆子的二八板和流水板式的曲调，很难表现得如此灵活，情绪难以如此真切，音乐语言难以如此易解。
    合唱在得到曲艺这些长处以后，天地就广阔了，表现力大大提高了。
    和曲艺结合以后，每一首合唱曲都具有自己特有的，和一个曲（剧）种的风格相连系的独特风格。一般化和枯燥乏味的毛病没有了。例如广东南音合唱《农村新面貌》的歌词并不是很有特性的。由于南音音乐赋予这个曲子以鲜明的风格，它的艺术感染力和艺术表现力提高了，演员一张嘴就能够吸引听众。其余几首合唱曲同样都是风格鲜明的。
    用原来以独唱为主的曲艺、戏曲音乐写合唱，不是一件简单的工作。作曲家必须深入学习曲艺、戏曲，必须深知合唱的特性，必须发挥自己的创造性，才能把这个工作作好。这几个曲子成功地把曲艺、戏曲音乐和合唱形式结合起来了，保留了曲艺、戏曲音乐原有的风格，也发挥了合唱的特长，曲艺、戏曲音乐合唱化了。单弦合唱《人民英雄纪念碑》和《三呼万岁》中，表现了广大人民群众歌颂革命斗争中的英雄，欢呼三面红旗的热情，声势是浩大的，洋溢着群众性的革命情感。如果用原来的单弦音乐表现这种情感，困难是较多的。单弦音乐用在合唱中以后，已起了质的变化。曲剧《苦菜花》选曲的结尾用强烈的合唱，表现了娟子坚定的胜利信心和昂扬的革命意志；加了合唱才能作得如此强烈，仅仅用独唱就有一定的局限性。曲剧《阎家滩》选曲中，用把许多合唱声部和独唱交织在一起你呼我应的手法，表现左桂兰这个宦门少女独自思念未婚夫阎景安的复杂心情，比只用一个声部表现这种心情的效果迥然不同，千头万绪的心情就更真切一些。有许多独唱擅长表现的东西，例如曲艺和戏中的散板和细腻复杂的长拖腔等，在合唱中就没有多用。
    成套地继承曲艺和戏曲，又把继承下来的东西合唱化，结果就创造了一种新的合唱品种。它是一种土生土长的，放着浓郁香味的，完完全全民族化的鲜花。由这几首合唱曲已可以看出它的生命力十分旺盛，表现范围十分宽阔，既可以表现历史题材，也可以表现现代的革命题材；既可以咏物，又可以写人；既长于叙事，亦善于抒情。民族艺术中几百种曲艺和戏曲为它提供吸取不尽的艺术泉源。只要精心栽培，它是有很大发展前途的。
    曲艺和戏曲合唱的出现，必然会对曲艺和戏曲的改革和发展起推动作用。《人民英雄纪念碑》和《三呼万岁》中表现的群众性、革命性的时代情绪，会对单弦及其他曲艺发生好的影响。曲艺剧、河南梆子等都可以在这里找到如何用本剧种的音乐发展本剧种的合唱的道路。
    中央乐团合唱队的演员们深入地学习了各地的曲艺和戏曲，用各地方言演唱曲艺节目，处理语言的本领提高了，可以把字吐得清楚生动。学习了曲艺和戏曲表情很生动的特点，就唱得比过去有情绪、感人。在有些小节目中吸收了一些曲艺和戏曲的动作，就使演出的风格很生动、不呆板。北京曲艺团的同志们在和中央乐团合作的过程中也吸取了一些有益的东西，例如魏喜奎同志就增加了和合唱队合作的经验；乐队同志们的演奏就不仅工夫结实，而且在强弱、快慢、刚柔的处理上，有更鲜明的目的性，把演奏和表现思想情感更进一步地结合起来。新旧结合，土洋结合，会推动两方面的发展，好处是很多的。
    这些合唱作品多数是业余作曲家的作品，职业作曲家参加工作的还少，也没有专业的文学家和诗人参加工作。如果能有更多人关心这个工作，还可能作出更多的成绩。在深入学习曲艺和戏曲，取得一定创作经验以后，作曲家和诗人都是大有可为的，还可以比这几个作品作得更大胆，更有独创性；还可以找到更多在合唱中运用曲艺和戏曲的道路；合唱的表现力还可大大提高；还可以选择更多的题材，写出思想性和艺术性更高的合唱作品。
    中央乐团曾经和北京几个文艺团体合演了贝多芬的合唱交响乐，成为哄动一时的盛事，现在中央乐团和北京曲艺团合演了曲艺合唱音乐会，同样应该看作是一件对我国合唱艺术的发展有深远影响的大事情。祝贺乐团和曲艺团同志们的成功，希望他们取得更大的成绩。
