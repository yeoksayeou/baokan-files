Xinhua News Agency, December 6th, New York Dispatch: The United Nations Security Council held a meeting on the evening of the 3rd to discuss the admission of new member states. The Soviet representative, Zorin, put forward a proposal at the meeting, requesting that the issue of admitting the Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations be included on the meeting's agenda. He pointed out that the Mongolian People's Republic had applied to join the United Nations fourteen years ago and has every reason to be admitted, but this issue has not been resolved to this day due to the discriminatory policies adopted by Western countries. Representatives from Poland and Ceylon spoke in support of the Soviet proposal.

However, the meeting, under Western manipulation, rejected the Soviet proposal.

The meeting then discussed a motion put forward by the representatives of France and Tunisia, requesting the admission of Mauritania, which had recently declared its independence, as a member state of the United Nations. The representative of Morocco, who was invited to attend the meeting, firmly opposed the motion of France and Tunisia. The Soviet representative, Zorin, said in his speech that the Mauritania issue is much more complicated than the situation of some other countries that were recently admitted to the United Nations. Moreover, admitting Mauritania without admitting the Mongolian People's Republic is also an open act of discrimination against socialist countries. Zorin said that under these circumstances, the Soviet delegation believes it is impossible to support this motion.

In the vote, the Soviet Union and Poland voted against the motion, eight votes were in favor, and Ceylon abstained. The motion of France and Tunisia was not passed.

    帝国主义国家顽固敌视社会主义国家
    再次操纵安理会拒绝蒙古加入联合国
    新华社6日讯  纽约消息：联合国安全理事会3日晚上举行会议，讨论接纳新会员国问题。苏联代表佐林在会上提出一个建议，要求把接纳蒙古人民共和国加入联合国的问题列入会议议程。他指出，蒙古人民共和国在十四年前就提出了加入联合国的申请，并且有着一切理由被接纳，但是由于西方国家采取歧视政策，这个问题至今还没有解决。波兰和锡兰代表在发言时支持苏联的建议。
    但是会议在西方的操纵下却否决了苏联的建议。
    会议接着讨论法国和突尼斯代表提出的一个动议，要求接纳不久前宣布为独立国的毛里塔尼亚为联合国会员国。被邀请参加会议的摩洛哥代表坚决反对法国和突尼斯的动议。苏联代表佐林在发言时说，毛里塔尼亚问题比不久前被接纳加入联合国的其他一些国家的情况复杂得多。而且，接纳毛里塔尼亚而不接纳蒙古人民共和国，这也是一个对社会主义国家的公开的歧视行动。佐林说，在这种情况下，苏联代表团认为不可能支持这个动议。
    在表决时，苏联和波兰投票反对这项动议，八票赞成，锡兰弃权。法国和突尼斯的动议没有通过。
