    Organizing Traveling Kettle Menders
    The Handan Municipal Party Committee recently convened a city-wide agricultural machinery conference, which not only arranged for the production and repair of production tools, but also made specific arrangements for the production and repair of daily necessities for rural life. The conference paid attention to arranging the repair of cooking pots.

    The kettle menders of the Wu'an mining area in Handan City are well-known. In the past, they went to villages to repair cooking pots for the peasants, which was convenient for the masses. In the past two years, some counties and communes have organized kettle repair outlets, and relaxed the organization of craftsmen to travel around. When the pots in the canteens are broken, commune members often have to walk a long way to take them to the outlets for repair, wasting a lot of time. Recently, the Handan Municipal Party Committee decided to organize a group of kettle menders from the Wu'an mining area to form repair teams to travel to various counties and communes, to repair cooking pots and teach kettle repair techniques. Each commune and team should gradually achieve having both agricultural tool manufacturing and repair hands, as well as daily necessities manufacturing and repair hands. This practice can be used as a reference for various places.  - Min

    组织锯锅匠串乡
    中共邯郸市委最近召开的全市农业机械会议，不仅安排了生产工具的修造任务，还对农村生活用具的生产修理作了具体部署。会议注意安排了饭锅的修补工作。
    邯郸市武安矿区的锯锅匠人很有名。过去，他们下乡串村，给农民修补饭锅，群众称便。近两年，有的县、社组织了修补锅的门市部，便放松了组织匠人流动串乡。食堂的锅坏了，社员往往要走不少路拿到门市部去修理，浪费不少时间。最近中共邯郸市委决定由武安矿区组织一批锯锅匠人组成修理组，到各县、社流动串乡，一面修理饭锅，一面传授修锅技术。每个社、队要逐步作到既有农具制造修理手，又有生活用具制造修理手。这种作法可供各地参考。	　民
