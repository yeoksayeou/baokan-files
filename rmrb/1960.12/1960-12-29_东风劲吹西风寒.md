    The combined strength of China and the Soviet Union is as mighty as the heavens,
    The East Wind blows strongly, the West Wind is cold,
    Thousands of husbands are terrified and panicked,
    Tens of thousands of people are of one heart, joyfully rushing forward.
    Mad dogs bark at the sun in vain,
    Red flags shine all over the world,
    Storms rise in the nine provinces, shaking the earth,
    Songs of triumph resound throughout the world.

    东风劲吹西风寒
    海棱中苏合力势如天，东风劲吹西风寒，千夫裂胆惊慌乱，万众同心喜奔先。吠日狂犬空狺狺，日照红旗遍大千，九州风暴动地起，四海欢歌奏凯旋。
