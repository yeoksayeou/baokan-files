Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, 25th — Belgian workers are continuing their nationwide general strike against the government's reactionary economic policies with high morale.

Almost all of Belgium is paralyzed. In the vast area from Liège in the east to Charleroi in the south, all mines, factories, and steel enterprises have ceased operations. Business, transportation, and other activities in major cities across the country have completely stopped, postal and telecommunications are cut off, and most of the country's railways are paralyzed. Many schools and local administrative departments have also closed.

According to earlier disclosures by Belgian parliamentarians during debates, as of December 23, 500,000 workers nationwide had already joined the general strike. Belgian capitalists estimate that the strike has already caused them losses of several billion francs.

The Belgian government, panicked by the massive strike struggle, is not only dispatching large numbers of police but is also currently mobilizing troops to suppress the striking workers. In cities such as Liège and Antwerp, helmeted armed police violently dispersed demonstrating workers and beat the worker pickets at the train stations. The police also arrested some workers. Armed police posts have been set up at parliamentary buildings and railway junctions.

However, all this cannot stop the vigorous development of the strike movement. Now the striking workers in all enterprises and agencies have established "Coordinated Action Committees" and decided to hold mass demonstrations nationwide. In Ghent, workers continued to demonstrate and march in the streets yesterday; in Flémalle, workers sang the "Internationale" during their march.

The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party stated in a statement that the strike was the result of the Isgrens government provoking widespread anger among the working people. The statement condemned the government's counterattack against the workers and pointed out that the struggle will continue to expand. The statement also called on the Belgian working class and all working people to strengthen their unity.

    反对政府的反动经济政策
    比利时五十万工人坚持大罢工
    厂矿企业停顿　交通邮电瘫痪　资方损失巨大
    据新华社25日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：比利时工人正在斗志昂扬地继续展开反对政府的反动经济政策的全国性大罢工。
    比利时全国几乎全陷于瘫痪。在东起列日南迄沙勒罗瓦的广大地区内，所有矿井、工厂和钢铁企业，全部停止了活动。全国各大城市的商业、交通及其他活动完全停顿，邮电通讯断绝，全国的铁路绝大部分瘫痪。许多学校和地方行政部门也关了门。
    据比利时议员早些时候在辩论中透露，到12月23日为止，全国已经有五十万工人参加了这次大罢工。比利时资产阶级估计，这次罢工已经给他们带来了数十亿法郎的损失。
    被声势浩大的罢工斗争吓得手忙脚乱的比利时政府除派出大批警察之外，目前正抽调军队来镇压罢工工人。在列日、安特卫普等城市，头戴钢盔的武装警察用暴力冲散示威的工人，并且殴打在火车站的工人纠察队。警察还逮捕了一些工人。在议会和铁路交叉点都布置了武装警察的岗哨。
    但是，这一切都不能阻止罢工运动的蓬勃发展。现在所有的企业和机关的罢工工人都成立了“协同行动委员会”，并且决定要在全国举行大示威。在根特尔，工人们昨天继续在街上示威游行；在佛维尔，工人们在游行时还高唱“国际歌”。
    比利时共产党中央委员会政治局在一项声明中指出，这次罢工是伊斯更斯政府激起劳动人民的普遍愤怒的结果。声明谴责政府对工人的反扑，并且指出，斗争将继续扩大。声明还号召比利时工人阶级和所有劳动人民加强团结。
