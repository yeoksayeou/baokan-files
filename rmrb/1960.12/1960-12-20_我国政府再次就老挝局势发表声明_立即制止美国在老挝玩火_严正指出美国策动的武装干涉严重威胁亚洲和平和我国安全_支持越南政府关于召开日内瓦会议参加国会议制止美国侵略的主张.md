Xinhua News Agency, 19th Dispatch: The Government of the People's Republic of China's Further Statement on the Lao Situation
December 19, 1960

The situation in Laos is becoming increasingly serious.  Disregarding the repeated appeals and warnings from socialist countries and many peace-loving nations, US imperialism has brazenly supported the Lao rebel group in provoking a large-scale civil war in Laos. This is the largest armed intervention orchestrated by US imperialism in the Indochina region since the 1954 Geneva Conference. It not only tramples upon the sovereignty and independence of Laos but also seriously threatens the peace of the Indochina region and Asia. Therefore, the war in Laos cannot but cause serious unease among governments and people of all peace-loving countries. As a close neighbor of Laos and one of the guarantors of the Geneva Agreements, China cannot but feel deeply concerned about the grave situation in Laos.

The outbreak of large-scale civil war in Laos is the result of the rampant interference in Lao internal affairs by US imperialism and its lackey, the reactionary Thai authorities. US imperialism has been supporting the Lao rebel group economically and militarily, instigating activities to overthrow the Lao Royal Government headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma. When the Lao rebels attacked Vientiane, US imperialism's hostile activities against the Lao people became even more blatant and blatant. It not only supplied the rebels with large quantities of munitions and other military equipment but even sent military personnel to openly participate directly in the war.  The offices of the US imperialist and its lackeys Thailand and South Vietnam in Vientiane have even become strongholds for the rebels to attack the Lao Royal Government forces and the Lao people. This reckless act of aggression by US imperialism is a grave provocation against peace and security in Asia and the world. All peace-loving countries and people should resolutely oppose and stop this act of playing with fire by US imperialism.

The Chinese government has always believed that the Lao issue should be resolved by the Lao people themselves. It firmly opposes the US imperialist and its lackey Thailand's acts of aggression involving armed intervention, subversion, and division against Laos, and closely watches the grave threat to our national security caused by such acts of aggression. The Chinese government reiterates solemnly that the US imperialist and its lackey Thailand's blatant acts of aggression and interference in Laos must be stopped immediately, and the sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity of Laos must be respected. In order to promptly extinguish the flames of war provoked in Laos and stabilize the Lao situation, the Chinese government supports the proposal put forward in the statement of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on December 17, namely: to reconvene a meeting of the countries participating in the 1954 Geneva Conference and to restore the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos in order to seek ways to stop US aggression and protect the basic national rights of the Lao people. The Chinese government calls on all countries and people concerned about peace in Indochina to immediately take effective measures and actions to make positive efforts to safeguard the Geneva Agreements and restore peace in Laos.

    我国政府再次就老挝局势发表声明
    立即制止美国在老挝玩火
    严正指出美国策动的武装干涉严重威胁亚洲和平和我国安全
    支持越南政府关于召开日内瓦会议参加国会议制止美国侵略的主张
    新华社19日讯　中华人民共和国政府关于老挝局势的再次声明
    1960年12月19日
    目前老挝的局势越来越严重了。美帝国主义不顾各社会主义国家和许多爱好和平的国家的一再呼吁和警告，悍然支持老挝叛乱集团挑起了老挝的大规模的内战。这是自1954年日内瓦会议以后，由美帝国主义在印度支那地区策动的一次规模最大的武装干涉。它不仅使老挝的主权和独立遭到蹂躏，而且使印度支那地区和亚洲的和平受到严重威胁。因此，老挝的战争不能不引起爱好和平的各国政府和人民的严重不安。作为老挝的近邻和日内瓦协议的保证国之一的中国，更不能不对老挝的严重局势感到深切关怀。
    老挝大规模内战的爆发，是美帝国主义和它的仆从泰国反动当局猖狂地干涉老挝内政的结果。美帝国主义一直在经济上、军事上扶植老挝叛乱集团，主使推翻以富马亲王为首的老挝王国政府的活动。在老挝叛军进攻万象的时候，美帝国主义敌视老挝人民的活动更加粗暴和露骨，它不仅供应叛军大量军火武器和其他军事装备，甚至派遣军事人员公然直接参战。美帝国主义及其仆从泰国、南越驻万象的使馆和其他机构的办公处所竟然成为叛军进攻老挝王国政府军和老挝人民的据点。美帝国主义这种肆无忌惮的侵略行为，是对亚洲和世界和平和安全的严重挑衅。一切爱好和平的国家和人民应该坚决反对和制止美帝国主义的这种玩火行为。
    中国政府一向认为，老挝问题应该由老挝人民自己解决，坚决反对美帝国主义及其仆从泰国对老挝进行武装干涉、颠复和分裂的侵略行为，并且密切地注视着由于这种侵略行为所引起的对我国安全的严重威胁。中国政府再次郑重声明，美帝国主义和它的仆从泰国侵略和干涉老挝的粗暴行为必须立即制止，老挝的主权、独立、统一和领土完整，必须受到尊重。为了及时扑灭在老挝挑起的战火，稳定老挝局势，中国政府支持越南民主共和国政府12月17日声明中提出的主张，即：再次召开1954年日内瓦会议参加国的会议和恢复老挝国际监察和监督委员会的活动，以寻求制止美国侵略，保障老挝人民基本民族权利的办法。中国政府吁请一切关心印度支那和平的国家和人民，立即采取有效措施和行动，为维护日内瓦协议和重新恢复老挝的和平而作出积极的努力。
