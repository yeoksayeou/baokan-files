    Give Full Play to the Fighting Role of Party Groups
    —An Investigation Report on the Strengthening of Party Group Work by the Party Committee of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company during the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign
    Shi Gang Party Committee Writing Group, Our Newspaper Reporter
    In the increase production and practice economy campaign centered on grain and steel, the Party Committee of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company vigorously strengthened its leadership over production groups. While deeply mobilizing workers to participate in management, it earnestly strengthened the work of Party groups, enabling the Party groups, under the leadership of the Party branches, to give full play to their fighting role. With the Party group as the core, each production group became a vibrant and strong production fighting organization in the enterprise and a basic position for conducting ideological and political work among the masses. "When the roots are deep, the leaves flourish." With the work of the production groups strengthened and the foundation laid well, the entire enterprise's increase production and practice economy campaign was carried out vigorously and practically, achieving immediate results. In September, the company's daily output of pig iron and steel increased by 17.05% and 14.64% respectively compared to August, and in October, it increased by 2.3% and 14% respectively compared to September. In October, iron consumption per ton of steel decreased by 2.14% compared to September, and the coke ratio for iron smelting decreased by 2.4% compared to September. The qualification rates for both steel and iron were above 99%.
    
    Facing New Situations

    Between June and July this year, the Party Committee of Shi Gang transferred more than 1,400 cadres to the front line of production. They took production groups as their base, grasped class management, and carried out red flag competitions. More than 1,800 production groups in the company, under the leadership of the Party, selected more than 14,000 worker-administrators in charge of planning, technology, equipment, quality, accounting, safety, labor organization, education, and life, according to their respective situations, and actively participated in enterprise management. The participation of group workers in management became not only more frequent and specific but also appropriately expanded in scope. Many things that were not previously managed were proactively undertaken by the groups. The production groups were very active, grasping both production and ideology, both management and learning and life. Under these circumstances, the original working methods of the production group leaders were difficult to adapt to the new situation. They had to lead production, grasp competitions, and guide the activities of worker-administrators; many problems had to be resolved decisively in accordance with the Party's policies and resolutions. Many production group leaders felt overwhelmed and asked the branch for solutions.

    The production leap forward demanded the strengthening of the work of production groups, and the development of the work of production groups urgently demanded that the Party branch strengthen its leadership over them. However, the number of Party branch committee members was limited, the number of production groups was large, and the production tasks were complex. How many problems awaited their solution in every 24-hour day! The issue of strengthening the Party branch's leadership over production groups and giving full play to the core role of Party groups in production groups was thus put on the agenda of Party organizations.

    The Core of the Production Team

    At this time, the company Party committee discovered a model advanced Party group on the basic construction site - the "Iron and Steel Assault Team" Party group. This Party group had four Communist Party members, and the Party group leader, Zhao Enrong, also served as the production team leader. They worked in a cement worker production team of sixteen people. Over the years, the Party group led the entire team to overfulfill the production plan every month. This year, they completed the year's workload in 156 days.
    Under the leadership of the Party branch, this Party group comprehensively cared for the team's ideology, production, life, and learning. They adhered to putting politics in command, with everyone participating, making ideological and political work deep, timely, and frequent, so that team members always maintained full political enthusiasm; they frequently analyzed the key to production, driving the masses to solve problems in production in a timely manner; Party members always set an example, playing a model leading role, closely contacting the masses, and caring for the lives of the masses; the Party group strictly conducted organizational life and frequently carried out criticism and self-criticism.

    Whenever the team accepted an important engineering task, the Party group held meetings to study measures to ensure the completion of the task. In September of this year, they undertook the task of plastering the columns of the small rolling mill plant. Initially, the section chief who led them calculated that 250 scaffold poles were needed to tie the scaffolding. However, the scaffold poles were all being used on the project at the time. Just as the section chief was anxious, the Party group also calculated: by alternating the use of the scaffold poles, only 90 would be needed. The Party members immediately took the lead and, together with the entire team, recovered 90 scaffold poles from 30-meter-high factory buildings and 20-meter-deep foundations, overcame the difficulties, and completed the task four days ahead of schedule. In the process of completing the task, the Party group frequently and promptly seized problems that arose in production and held "battlefield meetings" to solve them according to the time and place. Once, after they were responsible for pouring concrete on the platform of the steelmaking plant, they did not receive straw curtains in time. At a short "battlefield meeting," the Party group decided that Party members should take the lead in pulling Artemisia grass around the factory building to replace the straw curtains, ensuring the quality of the project.

    Party members always took the lead in hard work in production. Wherever the task was urgent, wherever the work was heavy, wherever the labor conditions were poor, the Communist Party members first appeared there. Under the influence of Party members, all team workers could actively overcome difficulties. Since the beginning of this year, this team has made 220 tools, saving and recycling materials worth 170,000 yuan, and completing each project ahead of schedule. The team members have been trained into "multi-skilled" all-rounders. In addition to being cement workers, they can also do the work of bricklayers, scaffolders, painters, steelworkers, and other six types of work, and have reached the advanced level of these professional trades.

    This Party group relied on the masses in everything, consulted with the masses on everything, listened to the opinions of the masses with an open mind, supported their rationalization proposals, and encouraged their enthusiasm for production. For example, in the project of pouring concrete for the pre-fabricated columns of the machinery plant, workers Wang Decai and Li Xiuhai suggested using column templates as supports instead of tying scaffolding. This suggestion was immediately supported by Party group leader Zhao Enrong. After testing, it was implemented in the project, saving more than 700 workdays for scaffolders. The Party group frequently cared for and guided worker-administrators in carrying out their professional activities, implementing the spirit of the General Line in all work. According to the team's annual plan of "one person doing the work of two, doubling the targets," the planner was responsible for proposing the progress arrangement for each project, the quota setter drafted specific measures, the material staff was responsible for preparing the budget, and the quality inspector and safety officer analyzed the on-site construction conditions and put forward precautions, etc. The Party group regularly studied their work, supported their opinions, and respected their authority, so that everyone was happy to take responsibility. The Party group also led the entire team to learn from the advanced with an open mind, enthusiastically help the backward, and promote the communist style. For the past two years, this team has been rated as an advanced unit of the company every quarter.

    The ability of the workers in the "Iron and Steel Assault Team" to maintain full political enthusiasm and production initiative is the result of the Party group carrying out in-depth ideological and political work under the leadership of the branch. The four Party members of the Party group each contacted several workers and, before class, after meals, in the rest room, and in the dormitory, frequently talked with the masses, helping them to raise their awareness. For a period of time, worker Huang Fengyu did not have enough energy to work. What was affecting the enthusiasm of this worker from a hired labor background? When Party member Li Changming chatted with him, he found that Lao Huang felt that he was living a good life now, satisfied with the status quo, and his political ambition was not so high. The Party group organized a forum comparing the old and new societies in the team. The tragic scene of being oppressed by landlords before liberation aroused Huang Fengyu's infinite sadness and enlightened his class consciousness. He said, "How can one forget the pain after the sore has healed!" From then on, Huang Fengyu has always been an activist in the team. One day, Zhang Guowu went to work in a fit of anger, which Zhao Enrong noticed at a glance. It turned out that this worker had quarreled with his lover again. After work, Zhao Enrong immediately visited Zhang Guowu's home. After Zhao Enrong's mediation, Zhang Guowu and his wife reconciled. He said with emotion: "Lao Zhao has done his work to my home, and the Party's care is really meticulous!" The Communist Party members' enthusiastic concern for the political progress and life of the masses made the masses trust and love the Party members very much. The workers regarded the Party members as their "close friends," and took the initiative to discuss with the Party members on ideological, production, and life issues. They were closely united around the Party.

    Due to the continuous education of the Party, the political awareness of the workers in this team has been rapidly improved. In the past two years, among the 23 workers who have worked in this team, five backward workers and eight intermediate workers have been transformed into advanced elements with the education and help of the Party group, four of whom have become glorious Communist Party members. They have also transferred seven backbone elements (including four Party members) to support fraternal teams. Among the existing 16 people, in addition to the four Party members and five progressive workers, the three intermediate members and the four newly transferred young workers are also rapidly improving their class consciousness and technical level.

    The administrative leaders of this team pay great attention to relying on the Party group and giving play to the fighting role of the Party group. Team leader Zhao Enrong and deputy team leader Li Changming always submitted the most important issues of the entire team to the Party group for collective discussion, and listened to the opinions of Party members with an open mind. Every Communist Party member actively participated in this discussion. After the problem was decided, the captain was administratively responsible for leading the worker-administrators to organize the implementation, and the Party members played a model backbone role in the implementation, and promptly put forward new suggestions according to the changes in the situation. Zhao Enrong and Li Changming realized that "The Party group's work not only did not take over the administrative work and weaken the role of the captain, but strengthened the captain's leadership." The trade union group leader is a member of the masses, and also often attended the meetings of the Party group. After the plans and measures for completing various engineering tasks were determined, he specifically organized the competition between people in the team, and organized the competition between this team and other teams. The trade union also held a group life meeting every week to check the achievements and shortcomings in the work, and carried out comradely criticism and self-criticism among all the workers in the team. The two members of the Communist Youth League in the team are responsible for uniting and helping the newly arrived young workers, organizing them to learn technology from the old workers, and learn the revolutionary enthusiasm of the old workers and their noble proletarian qualities. With the Party group as the core, various organizations cooperated to comprehensively grasp the production, ideology, life, and management of the team, and organized the enthusiasm of all 16 people in the team to the common goal of overfulfilling the task.

    These activities of the "Iron and Steel Assault Team" Party group are carried out under the direct leadership of the Party branch. In various movements and production work, the Party branch frequently listened to the reports of the Party group, listened to the opinions and requirements of Party members and the masses, gave tasks to the Party group, pointed out the direction, and talked about methods; the Party branch and the cadres of the higher-level Party committee also frequently participated in labor in this group, checked the work, organized learning, and specifically guided the Party group to carry out activities, making the Party group a capable assistant for the Party branch to complete various tasks.

    Learning from Advanced Party Groups
    The working experience of the "Iron and Steel Assault Team" Party group received great attention from the Shi Gang Party Committee. In order to further deepen the Party's leadership to the front line, so that the Party's leadership could take deeper root in the basic units of the enterprise—the production groups—the Party Committee promoted the experience of the "Iron and Steel Assault Team" Party group throughout the company—under the unified and centralized leadership of the Party's grassroots organization, the Party branch, adapt to the characteristics of the factory enterprises' three-shift operation, actively play the fighting role of the Party group, strengthen class work, and ensure the leap forward in production. A upsurge of learning from and catching up with the "Iron and Steel Assault Team" Party group was vigorously launched in all Party organizations of the company.

    The company Party committee led this movement in three aspects: First, summarizing the working experience of the "Iron and Steel Assault Team" Party group, and vigorously publicizing and promoting it throughout the company; Second, appropriately adjusting the setting of Party groups and the distribution of Party members according to the production organization, universally training Party group leaders and Party branch committee members, and further strengthening the Party branch's leadership over the Party groups; Third, mobilizing all Party groups and Party members to use the "Iron and Steel Assault Team" Party group as a mirror to conduct self-examination and improve their ideological style.

    In just over a month, more than 3,000 Party members in the company listened to the experience introduction of the "Iron and Steel Assault Team" Party group; 12% of the Party groups originally had Party members distributed in different production shifts, and after adjustment, the Party groups were matched with the production groups; 150 production groups that originally had no Party members or had weak Party member strength were appropriately equipped or increased with Party members. More than 1,300 Party group leaders and branch committee members throughout the company universally studied and discussed the work tasks and work methods of the Party branch and group, and summarized and exchanged work experience. Some branches also set up deputy secretaries of the branch in the three continuously producing shifts to strengthen the leadership of the group work. In this way, a good foundation was laid ideologically and organizationally for strengthening the work of Party groups.

    The working experience of the "Iron and Steel Assault Team" Party group quickly spread, and Communist Party members consciously examined their ideological situation and considered their work style. They asked themselves a series of questions: How can we do the work as comprehensively and excellently as the "Iron and Steel Assault Team" Party group, so that our Party group can further play a fighting role under the leadership of the Party branch? How can we be like the Party members of the "Iron and Steel Assault Team", setting an example in everything, contacting the masses, and uniting the workers of our group more closely around the Party? ... This uproar in people's minds quickly turned into a huge force, making the entire enterprise's work appearance completely new. Yin Zhong's Party group in the metalworking workshop of the Machinery Factory used to wait for arrangements and wait for "content" in meetings. Now, they proactively lead the masses to overcome difficulties and complete the production task of processing ingot molds ahead of schedule, becoming an advanced group and being called the "locomotive" by the workers. Yang Jintai, a Party member of the Sintering Plant, who used to bury his head in work, did not do ideological work, and was called a "production Party member" by people, now frequently visits the homes of backward workers in the same group to chat and tells the basic knowledge of the Party to workers who apply to join the Party, becoming an active member in doing ideological and political work. The air blower Party group of the Power Plant, which used to have insufficient cooperation between the three shifts, now cooperates as one shift and everyone is united as one person. In just over a month, 65% of the company's 1,048 Party groups reached the advanced level of the "Iron and Steel Assault Team" Party group.

    Huge Energy

    The practice of this company proves that, at present, in industrial enterprises, strengthening the Party branch's leadership over production groups and giving full play to the core role of the Party group in production groups has extremely important significance.

    First, after the work of the Party groups is universally strengthened, the ideological and political work of the enterprise's grassroots organizations is greatly strengthened, so that the Party branch's ideological and political work is established on a solid organizational foundation, ensuring that the production groups can put politics in command in everything and put politics in command everywhere. Now, from why production is rising, why accidents occur, to who is absent from work, who quarreled with his wife, and how to help backward workers transform, etc., have become issues that the Party groups frequently pay attention to. Workers reflect: "The political atmosphere in the group is more intense!" Production team leaders said: "We have our own 'political commissar'!" Branch secretaries said: "Now, political work is truly rooted at the grassroots level!" Many difficult problems that people originally felt were thorny were quickly resolved because the Party groups grasped the essence of the problems from a political perspective.

    Second, after the work of the Party groups is universally strengthened, the Party's leadership over production is more specific, timely, frequent, and in-depth. With the Party group as the core, the production groups, in addition to actively participating in the production activities organized by the higher levels, also actively carry out activities within the group, just like the earth revolves around the sun, actively "spinning" on the "revolution" track. Now, the Party groups on each production post, together with the administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League group leaders, some grabbing at all three shifts, analyzing furnace by furnace, and solving problems in production in a timely manner; some comparing with advanced indicators, looking for weak links, and mobilizing the masses to attack key points; some raising tasks, arranging measures, and organizing class competitions; some setting up pace-setters, establishing models, and summarizing and promoting advanced experience.... Because the Party groups always maintain the most direct and deepest understanding of the constantly changing production situation, after they proactively grasp production, it is much more effective and powerful than just a few cadres grasping production. As many cadres realize: "The branch is like an arm, and the Party group is like a fingertip. Now, the strength is used to the fingertips." This can truly grasp production accurately, fiercely, deeply, finely, thoroughly, and mobilize the masses to solve problems on the spot at any time, eliminating problems in the bud.

    Third, after the work of the Party groups is universally strengthened, the Party members are not only producers but also political workers, and the relationship between the Party and the masses is further strengthened. The vast majority of Party groups have conducted specific research on the ideological and family situation of each employee in their unit and designated Party members to contact them separately. Through talking with the masses, visiting the homes of the masses, publicizing the Party's policies to the employees and their families, listening to the opinions of the masses with an open mind, helping them solve ideological problems, and educating them to carry forward the fine style of hard work, the Party members do the Party's political work to the classes and dormitories, and to the inner depths of each employee, so as to more closely unite the masses around the Party. With the enthusiastic help of Party members, the backward workers, who originally accounted for about 6% of the company's employees, have made progress to varying degrees.

    Fourth, after the work of the Party groups is universally strengthened, the fighting fortress role of the Party branches has been greatly promoted. The branch secretaries feel that the entire organization is more "alive" and "nimble." The branch secretary of No. 1 Blast Furnace feels that now there are his "hands" everywhere and his "eyes" everywhere, and the work is not chaotic. The branch secretary of No. 2 Blast Furnace said: "Many hands make light work, and everyone carries a heavy load, making the work better." The branch secretary of No. 3 Blast Furnace said: "Now, someone is worrying about every post, so we can sit down and consider the problems better."

    Now, the following relatively major issues are placed in front of the branch secretaries: How to promote the production of the entire workshop? How to exchange and summarize the experience of each production group? How to further improve the class awareness of the workers? ... After getting rid of some specific affairs, the branch secretaries can have more energy to better consider key issues. After the work of the Party groups is strengthened, conditions have been created for further improving the work of the branch, and higher requirements have been put forward for the work of the branch.

    Shi Gang's time for strengthening the work of the Party groups is still relatively short, the development of the work is still uneven, and the experience is still being enriched. However, this experience has shown great power. The result of the Party groups giving full play to their core role in the production groups under the leadership of the Party branch is, as the workers say, that now there are "axes" in every corner of the company. The production groups—the various cells of the enterprise—are moving nimbly around their own "axes"—the activities of the Party groups. Under the Party's deeper leadership, the wisdom of the masses, like the split atomic nucleus, produces huge energy, pushing the continuous leap forward of the entire enterprise's production.

    充分发挥党小组的战斗作用
    ——石景山钢铁公司党委在增产节约运动中加强党小组工作的调查报告
    石钢党委写作小组　本报记者
    在以粮钢为中心的增产节约运动中，中共石景山钢铁公司委员会大力加强对生产小组的领导，在深入发动工人参加管理的同时，切实加强党小组的工作，使党小组在党支部的领导下，充分发挥了战斗作用。各个生产小组以党小组为核心，成为企业中活跃的坚强的生产战斗组织和向群众进行思想政治工作的基本阵地。“根深叶自茂”，生产小组的工作加强了，基础打好了，整个企业的增产节约运动便轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实地开展起来，收到了立竿见影之效。9月份这个公司的生铁和钢的日产水平，比8月分别提高了17.05％和14.64％，10月又比9月分别提高了2.3％和14％。10月份，每吨钢的铁耗比9月份降低了2.14％，炼铁焦比比9月份降低了2.4％。钢和铁的合格率都在99％以上。
    面临着新的情况
    今年6、7月间，石钢党委抽调了一千四百多名干部下放到生产第一线。他们以生产小组为基地，抓班组管理，搞红旗竞赛。全公司一千八百多个生产小组，都在党的领导下，按照各自的情况分别选出了计划、技术、设备、质量、核算、安全、劳动组织、教育、生活等工人管理员共一万四千多人，积极参加企业管理。小组工人参加管理不仅更加经常、具体，而且范围也适当地扩大了。许多原来没有管的事情，小组都主动承担起来。生产小组中既抓生产，又抓思想，既抓管理，又抓学习和生活，非常活跃。在这种情况下，生产小组长们原来的工作方法已经难以适应新的形势。他们既要领导生产，又要抓竞赛，还要指导工人管理员的活动；许多问题又要按照党的政策和决议当机立断地来解决。不少生产小组长感到顾不过来了，纷纷向支部要办法。
    生产跃进要求加强生产小组的工作，生产小组的工作发展了，迫切要求党支部对它加强领导。但是党支部委员有限，生产小组很多，生产任务复杂，在每天的二十四小时内，有多少问题等待着他们解决啊！加强党支部对生产小组的领导，充分发挥党小组在生产小组中的核心作用的问题，就这样被提到党组织的议事日程上来了。
    生产小队的核心
    就在这个时候，公司党委在基本建设工地上发现了一个先进党小组的典型——“钢铁突击队”党小组。这个党小组有四名共产党员，党的小组长赵恩荣兼任生产小队长。他们在一个有十六个人的水泥工生产小队中工作。几年来，党小组领导全队工人月月超额完成生产计划。今年，他们用一百五十六天就完成了全年的工作量。
    这个党小组在党支部的领导下，全面关心小队的思想、生产、生活和学习。他们坚持政治挂帅，人人动手，把思想政治工作做得深透、及时、经常，使小队成员始终保持着饱满的政治热情；他们经常分析生产中的关键，带动群众及时解决生产中的问题；党员处处以身作则，起模范带头作用，密切联系群众，关心群众生活；党小组严格过组织生活，经常开展批评和自我批评。
    小队每接受一项重要的工程任务，党小组都开会研究保证完成任务的措施。今年9月，他们承担了小型轧钢厂厂房柱子抹灰的任务，起初，领导他们的工段长算了一笔账，需要二百五十根脚手杆绑架子。可是，脚手杆当时都用到工程上去了。工段长正着急，党小组也算了一笔账：把脚手杆倒换使用，只要九十根就行了。党员们立即带头和全队工人一起，从三十米高的厂房上面和二十米深的地基下面，回收了九十根脚手杆，克服了困难，提前四天完成了任务。在完成任务的过程中，党小组经常及时抓住生产中出现的问题，召开“战地会议”，因时因地加以解决。有一次，他们负责施工的炼钢厂平台浇灌混凝土以后，一时没有领到草帘子。在短促的“战地碰头会”上，党小组决定由党员带头在厂房周围拔蒿草，代替草帘子，使工程质量得到了保证。
    党员在生产中总是带头苦干，哪里任务紧急，哪里活重，哪里劳动条件差，共产党员就首先出现在哪里。在党员的影响下，全队工人都能积极战胜困难。今年以来，这个小队自制了二百二十件工具，节约、回收的材料价值十七万元，每项工程都提前完成。队员们锻炼成了“一专多能”的多面手，除了水泥工以外，还会干瓦工、架工、油工、钢筋工等六个工种的工作，并且达到了这些专业工种的先进水平。
    这个党小组处处依靠群众，遇事和群众商量，虚心听取群众的意见，支持他们的合理化建议，鼓舞他们的生产积极性。例如，在浇灌机械厂预制柱子混凝土的工程中，工人王德才、李秀海建议用柱子模板作支架，代替绑扎架子。这个建议立即得到党小组长赵恩荣的支持，经过试验，在工程中实施以后，节省架工七百多个工日。党小组经常关心和指导工人管理员开展业务活动，把总路线的精神贯彻到各项工作中去。根据小队“一人顶两人，指标翻一番”的全年计划，计划员负责提出每项工程的进度安排，定额员草拟具体措施，材料员负责编制预算，质量员、安全员分析现场施工条件、提出注意事项等。党小组定期研究他们的工作，支持他们的意见，尊重他们的职权，使人人乐于负责。党小组还带动全队工人虚心学习先进，热情帮助后进，发扬了共产主义风格。两年来，这个小队每季都被评为公司的先进单位。
    “钢铁突击队”的工人能够经常保持饱满的政治热情和生产积极性，是党小组在支部领导下深入进行思想政治工作的结果。党小组的四名党员，每人分工联系几个工人，在班前、饭后，在休息室和宿舍里，经常和群众谈心，帮助群众提高觉悟。工人黄凤余有一个时期，工作的劲头不那么足。是什么原因影响着这个雇工出身的工人的积极性呢？党员李长明在和他闲聊的时候，发现原来老黄感到现在日子过得不错了，满足现状，政治进取心不那么高了。党小组在小队里组织了一次新旧社会对比的座谈会，解放前受地主压迫的凄厉情景引起了黄凤余的无限辛酸，启发了他的阶级觉悟。他说：“一个人怎么能够好了疮疤忘了痛呢！”从此以后，黄凤余一直成为小队里的积极分子。有一天，张国武气冲冲地上班，赵恩荣一眼就看出来了。原来这个工人又和他的爱人吵了架。赵恩荣下班后，马上到张国武家访问。经过赵恩荣调解，张国武夫妻和好了。他感动地说：“老赵把工作做到了我的家里，党的关怀真是无微不至！”共产党员对群众的政治进步和生活方面的热情关怀，群众对党员十分信任和爱戴。工人们把党员看作是自己的“贴心人”，思想上、生产上和生活上有了问题，就主动找党员商量。他们紧紧地团结在党的周围。
    由于党的不断教育，这个小队工人们的政治觉悟迅速提高。两年多来，先后在这个小队工作过的二十三名工人中，经过党小组的教育和帮助，有五名后进工人和八名中间状态的工人转变成为先进分子，其中有四人成了光荣的共产党员。他们还输送了七名骨干分子（其中有四名党员）支援兄弟小队。在现有的十六个人中，除了四名党员和五名进步工人以外，三名中间分子和新调来的四名青年工人，也在迅速提高自己的阶级觉悟和技术水平。
    这个小队的行政领导干部很注意依靠党小组，发挥党小组的战斗作用。队长赵恩荣、副队长李长明，总是把全队最重要的问题提交党小组集体讨论，虚心听取党员的意见。每个共产党员都积极参与这种讨论。当问题决定下来之后，行政上由队长负责领导工人管理员组织执行，党员则在执行中发挥模范骨干作用，并且根据情况的变化，及时提出新的建议。赵恩荣和李长明体会到：“党小组这样作，不仅没有包办代替行政的工作，削弱队长的作用，反而使队长的领导更加强了。”工会小组长是个群众，也经常列席党小组的会议，当完成各项工程任务的计划和措施确定之后，他就具体地在小队内组织人与人之间的竞赛，并且组织本队和其它小队竞赛。工会每周还召开一次小组生活会，检查工作中的成绩和缺点，在全队工人中开展同志式的批评和自我批评。小队内的两个共青团员，负责团结、帮助新来的青年工人，组织他们向老工人学习技术，学习老工人的革命干劲和他们的无产阶级的高尚品德。各个组织以党小组为核心协同动作，就把小队的生产、思想、生活和管理全面地抓了起来，把全队十六个人的积极性，都组织到超额完成任务这一共同的目标上来了。
    钢铁突击队党小组的这些活动，都是在党支部的直接领导下进行的。在各项运动和生产工作中，党支部经常听取党小组的汇报，倾听党员和群众的意见与要求，给党小组提任务，指方向，讲方法；党支部和上级党委的干部，还经常到这个小组参加劳动，检查工作，组织学习，具体指导党小组开展活动，使党小组成为党支部完成各项任务的得力助手。
    向先进党小组看齐
    “钢铁突击队”党小组的工作经验，受到石钢党委的极大重视。党委为了进一步把党的领导深入到第一线，使党的领导在企业的基层单位——生产小组中更深地扎下根子，在全公司推广了“钢铁突击队”党小组的经验——在党的基层组织党支部的统一集中的领导下，适应工厂企业每天三班作业的特点，积极发挥党小组的战斗作用，加强班组工作，保证生产跃进。一个学、赶“钢铁突击队”党小组的热潮，在全公司所有的党组织中蓬勃地开展起来。
    公司党委从三个方面领导了这一运动：一、总结“钢铁突击队”党小组的工作经验，在全公司大张旗鼓地宣传推广；二、按照生产组织适当调整党小组的设置和党员的分布，普遍训练党小组长和党支部委员，进一步加强党支部对党小组的领导；三、发动所有的党小组和党员以“钢铁突击队”党小组作为一面镜子，对照检查，改进思想作风。
    在短短的一个多月中，全公司有三千多名党员听了“钢铁突击队”党小组的经验介绍；有12％的党小组原来党员分布在不同的生产班组中，经过调整后党小组和生产小组对上了“口”；原来没有党员或党员力量薄弱的一百五十个生产小组，适当配备或增加了党员。全公司一千三百多名党小组长和支部委员，普遍学习讨论了党支部、小组的工作任务和工作方法，总结交流了工作经验。有的支部还在连续生产的三个班，设立了支部副书记，加强对小组工作的领导。这样，便为加强党小组的工作在思想上、组织上打下了良好的基础。
    “钢铁突击队”党小组的工作经验迅速传播开来，共产党员自觉地检查自己的思想状况，考虑自己的工作作风。他们向自己提出了一系列的问题：怎样把工作做得像“钢铁突击队”党小组那样全面、出色，使自己的党小组在党支部的领导下进一步发挥战斗作用？怎样才能像“钢铁突击队”的党员那样，处处以身作则，联系群众，把本小组的工人更加紧密地团结在党的周围？……人们思想上的这一场轩然大波，很快就化为一股巨大的力量，使整个企业的工作面貌焕然一新。机械厂金工车间殷忠党小组，过去工作等布置，开会等“内容”，现在主动地带动群众克服困难，提前完成了加工钢锭模的生产任务，成为先进小组，被工人称为“火车头”。过去只是埋头干活、不做思想工作、被人们称为“生产党员”的烧结厂党员杨金太，现在经常到同组后进工人的家里串门谈心，给申请入党的工人讲述党的基本知识，成了做思想政治工作的积极分子。过去三班之间协作不够好的动力厂送风机党小组，现在三班协作如一班，众人团结如一人。在短短的一个多月中，全公司一千零四十八个党小组，有65％达到了“钢铁突击队”党小组的先进水平。
    巨大的能源
    这个公司的实践证明，目前在工业企业中，加强党支部对生产小组的领导，充分发挥党小组在生产小组中的核心作用，有着极其重要的意义。
    第一，党小组的工作普遍加强以后，企业基层组织的思想政治工作大大加强，使党支部的思想政治工作建立在坚实的组织基础上，保证生产小组能事事政治挂帅，处处政治挂帅。现在，从生产为什么上升，事故为什么发生，到谁为什么不上班，谁为什么和老婆吵了嘴，以及怎样帮助后进工人转变等等，都成了党小组经常关注的问题。工人们反映：“小组里政治空气更浓厚了！”生产组长说：“我们有了自己的‘政委’了！”支部书记说：“这下子政治工作真正一竿子扎到底了！”许多原来人们感到棘手的难题，由于党小组从政治上抓问题，一下就抓住了问题的本质，都很快解决了。
    第二，党小组的工作普遍加强以后，党对生产的领导更加具体、及时、经常、深入了。生产小组以党小组为核心，除了积极参加上级所组织的生产活动外，还在小组内部主动开展活动，就像地球围绕着太阳转动一样，在“公转”的轨道上活跃地“自转”着。现在，各个生产岗位上的党小组，和行政、工会、共青团的小组长一起，有的一班三抓，炉炉分析，及时解决生产中的问题；有的对照先进指标，寻找薄弱环节，发动群众攻打关键；有的提任务，排措施，组织班组竞赛；有的立标兵，树典型，总结推广先进经验……。由于党小组对不断变化着的生产情况，始终保持着最直接、最深切的了解，他们主动抓生产之后，就比仅仅由少数干部抓生产要切实有力得多。正如许多干部所体会的那样：“支部好像是手臂，党小组好比是手指头，现在劲使到手指尖上来了。”这就可以对生产真正做到抓准、抓狠、抓深、抓细、抓透，随时发动群众就地解决问题，把问题消除在萌芽之中。
    第三，党小组的工作普遍加强以后，党员既是生产者，又是政治工作者，党和群众的关系进一步密切了。绝大部分的党小组都对本单位每个职工的思想和家庭情况，做了具体研究，并指定党员分别进行联系。党员们通过同群众谈心，到群众家中访问，向职工和他们的家属宣传党的政策，虚心听取群众意见，帮助他们解决思想问题，教育他们发扬艰苦奋斗的优良作风，因人而异地把党的政治工作做到班组、宿舍中去，做到每个职工的内心深处，从而把群众更密切地团结在党的周围。在党员的热情帮助下，原来约占全公司职工6％的后进工人，都有了不同程度的进步。
    第四，党小组工作普遍加强以后，党支部的战斗堡垒作用大大地发扬了。支部书记们感到整个组织更加“活了”“灵了”。一号高炉的支部书记，感到现在到处都有他的“手”，到处都有他的“眼睛”，工作不忙乱了。二高炉支部书记说：“众人拾柴火焰高，千斤担子大家挑，工作更好做了。”三高炉支部书记说：“现在，每个岗位都有人在操心，可以更好地坐下来考虑问题了。”
    现在放在支部书记们面前的，是这样一些比较重大的问题：怎样促进全车间的生产？怎样交流和总结各个生产小组的经验？怎样进一步提高工人的阶级觉悟？……在摆脱了一些具体事务以后，支部书记们可以有更多的精力更好地考虑关键性的问题。党小组工作加强以后，为进一步提高支部工作创造了条件，也对支部工作提出了更高的要求。
    石钢加强党小组工作的时间还比较短，工作发展还不平衡，经验还在继续充实。但是，这一经验已经显示出巨大的力量。党小组在党支部的领导下，在生产小组中充分发挥核心作用的结果，正像工人们说的，现在公司的各个角落，都有了“轴儿”。生产小组——企业的各个细胞，都围绕着自己的“轴儿”——党小组的活动，灵敏地运动着。在党的更加深入的领导下，群众的智慧像分裂了的原子核一样，产生出巨大的能源，推动着整个企业的生产持续地向前跃进。
