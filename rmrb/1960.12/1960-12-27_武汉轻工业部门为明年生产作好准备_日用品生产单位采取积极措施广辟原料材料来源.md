According to Changjiang Daily: The Wuhan Municipal Daily Use Products Production Office is vigorously promoting current production on one hand, and preparing for next year's production on the other.

In order to concentrate efforts on increasing the production of daily use products urgently needed by the people, the Municipal Daily Use Products Production Office held a forum for salespersons, listened to the market supply and demand situation, identified forty-two varieties as urgently needed products, and organized forces to produce them in large quantities. In November, the output of daily-use small commodities increased by 52.41% compared with October, with items such as fire tongs, water buckets, and bamboo vegetable baskets increasing by more than double.

While grasping current production, and based on the purchase plans proposed by commercial departments and the development plan for handicraft production, specific arrangements were made for the production of small commodities next year. Under the principle of focusing on daily necessities, consolidating and improving old products, developing new products, improving product quality, and steadily increasing output, it was decided to produce 1,100 varieties next year. In arranging the production plan for small commodities next year, industrial and commercial departments paid special attention to the all-encompassing nature of small commodities, the large variety, and the flexible and diverse characteristics of handicraft production that change with different consumer preferences. A hierarchical management method was adopted for the production of small commodities, with 340 varieties of products closely related to people's lives, famous brand products, and traditional products all included in the scope of municipal and district plans, among which 120 major products are directly managed by the Municipal Handicraft Bureau. The remaining general daily necessities and hardware tools are handled through a contract system, with commercial departments directly linked to factories and signing purchase and sales contracts.

In order to ensure the normal production of daily-use small commodities, special attention was paid to the implementation of raw materials in the arrangement of next year's production, and each variety was researched and implemented one by one. For example, the cloth, tung oil, cotton yarn, nan bamboo, and steel wire needed for the production of oilcloth umbrellas are respectively resolved by the native products company, the Municipal Handicraft Bureau, districts, and factories. Now, industrial, commercial, and material supply departments have organized special forces to actively carry out allocation and transportation based on the material indicators allocated by the province and city, and some materials have been transferred to factories. In order to ensure smooth production next year, many factories are actively preparing for production, such as the Building Materials Hardware Factory and the Huazhong Steel Refinement Factory have handed over the ten tons of steel that have arrived at the factory to the Jiangnan Rolling Mill for processing and rolling sheets, and the molds for producing soup spoons are being carved and repaired.

Also, Wuhan's light industry system is actively preparing for production in order to vigorously increase the production of light industrial products and expand the variety of colors and patterns next year.

In order to prepare raw materials, many light industry factories in Wuhan are focusing on the organization, collection, procurement, and transportation of raw materials. For example, Yiqun and Xinya Paper Mills have organized more than 7,000 tons of reeds to enter the factory from the fourth quarter to the present, which can meet the needs of production in the first half of next year. The box pieces (used to make matchboxes) organized by the Wuhan Match Factory have been enough for the use of the first quarter of next year, and matchsticks and potassium chlorate can also supply the needs of January and February next year. The 1,300 tons of silica sand organized by the Wuhan Bottle Factory is enough for half a year's use, and the organized feldspar, marble, calcite, glass slag, etc. are also enough for the first quarter of next year. Wuhan Oil and Fat Chemical Factory has organized more than 600 tons of wild oil into the factory.

While grasping raw materials, they are also focusing on the overhaul and maintenance of machinery and equipment. Some factories have also replenished spare parts. On the one hand, the Wuhan Leather United Factory concentrates the factory's technical force to overhaul the leather-making and shoe-making machinery and equipment. On the other hand, it sends technicians and senior skilled workers to Shanghai to learn new patterns of leather shoes, laying the foundation for the production of high-end products next year.

    武汉轻工业部门为明年生产作好准备
    日用品生产单位采取积极措施广辟原料材料来源
    本报讯　据长江日报消息：武汉市日用品生产办公室一手大抓当前生产，一手抓明年生产准备。
    为了集中力量增产当前人民迫切需要的日用品，市日用品生产办公室，召开了营业员座谈会，听取了市场供需情况，确定了四十二个品种为当前急需产品，并组织力量进行大量生产。11月份日用小商品比10月份增长了52.41％，其中火钳、提水桶、竹菜篮等增长一倍以上。
    在抓当前生产的同时，并根据商业部门提出的要货计划和发展手工业生产的规划，对明年小商品生产进行了具体安排。在贯彻以人民生活用品为中心、巩固提高老产品、发展新产品，提高产品质量，稳步增加产量的原则下，确定明年计划生产品种一千一百种。在安排明年小商品生产计划中，工、商部门特别注意到小商品包罗万象、品种繁多，和手工业生产随着消费者的不同爱好，千变万化、灵活多样等特点，对小商品生产采取分级管理的办法，将与人民有密切关系的产品、名牌产品、传统产品等三百四十种全部纳入市、区计划范围，其中又以一百二十种主要产品由市手工业局直接管理。其余一般生活用品和五金工具等采取合同制办法，由商业部门直接与工厂挂钩，签订购销合同。
    为了保证日用小商品能正常生产，在安排明年生产时，特别重视了原材料落实工作，一个一个品种进行研究落实。如生产油布雨伞所需的布、桐油、棉纱、楠竹、钢丝等都分别由土产公司、市手工业局、区和工厂分别负责解决。现在工、商部门和物资供应部门已组织专门力量，根据省、市下拨物资指标，积极进行调运，现已有部分材料调运到厂。为了保证明年能顺利进行生产，许多工厂正积极做生产前的准备工作，如建材五金厂和华中钢精厂已将到厂的十吨钢材，交由江南轧片厂进行加工轧片，生产汤瓢的模具正在进行刻制和维修。
    又讯　武汉市轻工业系统为明年大力增产轻工业产品和扩大花色品种，积极作好生产准备。
    武汉市各轻工业工厂为了作好原料准备，许多工厂狠抓原料的组织、收集、采购和调运等工作。如益群、新亚造纸厂从四季度开始到现在，已组织了七千多吨芦苇进厂，可满足明年上半年生产的需要。武汉火柴厂组织进厂的盒片（做火柴盒用的）已够明年一季度的使用，火柴梗和氯酸钾也可供应明年1至2月的需要。武汉制瓶厂组织进厂的一千三百吨矽砂，可够半年使用，组织进厂的长石、云石、方解石、玻璃渣等也够明年一季度的需要。武汉油脂化学厂已组织六百多吨野生油料进厂。
    在抓原材料同时，他们还狠抓机器设备的检修和保养工作。有的厂并充实了备品备件。武汉皮革联合工厂一方面集中厂内技术力量检修制革和制鞋的机器设备，另一方面又派出技术人员和高级技术工人去上海学习皮鞋新花样，为明年生产高级产品打基础。
