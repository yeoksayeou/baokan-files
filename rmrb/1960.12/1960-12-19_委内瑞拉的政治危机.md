    The Political Crisis in Venezuela
    Zhang Ye
    Recently, the political situation in Venezuela has been in a serious crisis. The struggle of students and workers, which began on November 25th, demanding that the government change its domestic and foreign policies and protesting government repression, continues to persist in the capital, Caracas, and is expanding to the inland provinces.
    Rómulo Betancourt was elected as the presidential candidate of the Democratic Action party in the presidential election on December 7, 1958, after the Venezuelan people overthrew the ten-year-long pro-American dictatorship of Pérez Jiménez. Democratic Action is one of the largest bourgeois parties in Venezuela, representing the interests of the national bourgeoisie, while also having influence among the petty bourgeoisie and even some farmers. Two years prior, Betancourt had put forward a platform of bourgeois democratic reform, guaranteeing respect for democratic freedoms, limiting the activities of American monopoly capital, developing independent national industry, striving for the majority of oil company profits to go to the state, the state controlling Venezuela's oil resources, and implementing large-scale public works programs to solve unemployment, etc. Betancourt was elected by waving such a banner of democracy and progress, gaining the support of some of the national bourgeoisie, the petty bourgeoisie, and especially the masses of farmers.
    However, after Betancourt took office as president on February 13, 1959, the "coalition government" formed by the Democratic Action Party, the Democratic Republican Union, and the Christian Social Party excluded the Communist Party, one of the important political forces in the overthrow of the Jiménez dictatorship. Not all of those who participated in the government were people who had participated in the struggle against the dictatorship. This "coalition government" basically represented the interests of the national bourgeoisie and was led by the right wing of the national bourgeoisie. At the same time, there were also representatives of the big bourgeoisie in the government's membership, and to a certain extent, it represented the interests of some big landowners and the petty bourgeoisie. Such a government had both conflicting and consistent aspects with the United States. The aggressively inclined American imperialism was not reconciled to the collapse of its lackey, the Jiménez dictatorship, in Venezuela, and even disliked this "coalition government," which at least outwardly touted national democracy, especially fearing the awakening, unity, and persistent struggle of the Venezuelan people, as well as the "bad" influence of Venezuela's overthrow of the dictatorship and the victory of establishing a constitutional government in Latin America. Therefore, American imperialism tried every means to prevent Venezuela from advancing along the road of independence, democracy, and progress. On the one hand, it constantly instigated armed coups to overthrow the Venezuelan constitutional government; on the other hand, it used Venezuela's economic difficulties, using "aid" as bait, to force the Betancourt government to turn to the right and surrender.
    Under the influence of such internal and external factors, the Betancourt government abandoned its campaign promises and gradually embarked on a path of anti-national, anti-people, and anti-democratic policies.
    The first manifestation of the Betancourt government's abandonment of its campaign platform and gradual shift to the right was its failure to take fundamental measures to get rid of the shackles of American monopoly capital and independently develop the national economy, instead begging the United States for "aid" to solve its economic difficulties.
    Venezuela is a well-known oil-producing country, second only to the United States in oil production, accounting for the second largest share in the world, with oil exports bringing in 80% of the country's foreign exchange. However, Venezuela's oil production is almost entirely controlled by foreign monopoly capital, mainly American monopoly capital. In December 1958, the Venezuelan military junta committee promulgated a tax reform law, increasing the tax paid by foreign companies from 50% to 65%-70%. After Betancourt took office, he continued to implement this tax law, which required American oil monopoly organizations to pay Venezuela more taxes. In order to protect its oil interests in Venezuela, American imperialism took a series of retaliatory measures against Venezuela, such as announcing restrictions on oil imports, lowering oil sales prices, withdrawing some funds from Venezuela, laying off workers from American oil companies in Venezuela, and even threatening to close oil fields and stop company operations, etc. Although the Betancourt government had conflicts and waged a certain degree of struggle with American imperialism over this, it was limited to implementing the new tax law and establishing a national oil company, while in other aspects it still succumbed to pressure from Washington. This was manifested in delaying negotiations with the United States to abolish the U.S.-Venezuela commercial treaty, seeking loans with harsh conditions from American banks and the International Monetary Fund, welcoming foreign monopoly capital investment, indiscriminately repaying debts left over from the Jiménez dictatorship, attempting to freeze wages, and abandoning the state monopoly on basic industries such as petrochemicals and electricity.
    Because of the Betancourt government's wavering and weakness in the struggle to get rid of the plundering and control of American monopoly capital, as well as its illusions of relying on American "aid" to develop the economy, the policies it implemented led to a deterioration of Venezuela's economic situation. Currently, Venezuela's currency circulation has decreased, and its foreign exchange reserves have decreased from more than one billion US dollars at the end of 1958 to 60 million US dollars in March of this year. This situation has already affected the sharp rise in the cost of living. Due to the reduction of new investments, the layoffs of employees by American oil companies, and the suspension of public construction projects, the number of unemployed people in this country with a population of only 6.5 million has exceeded 250,000.
    The second manifestation of the Betancourt government's abandonment of its campaign platform and gradual shift to the right was that the promise of land reform, which had won the votes of the broad masses of farmers in the election, was not truly fulfilled. Under the urgent demands of the people of the whole country, especially the farmers, Betancourt signed the land reform law approved by the National Assembly on March 5 this year. This law stipulates that the state will distribute state-owned land and land of large estates with no production efficiency expropriated by the state to farmers, and farmers must pay a certain price when acquiring the land. This is a very incomplete "land reform" that cannot meet the farmers' demands for land, nor can it shake the foundations of the large estate system in the slightest. Moreover, according to the Betancourt government's plan, it will take twenty-five years to complete. However, Betancourt has not yet seriously implemented such a land reform law. As a result, the masses of farmers are increasingly dissatisfied and continue to launch a struggle for land.
    The third manifestation of the Betancourt government's abandonment of its campaign platform and gradual shift to the right was its leniency towards coup plotters and the remaining Jiménez elements, its failure to cleanse the armed forces and other state organs, and even, under certain circumstances, its compromise with these elements, attempting to rely on the strength of the army to maintain its regime. This has led to the increasing prominence of compromise and surrender elements in the "coalition government," to the point that they openly demanded that Betancourt, under the guise of anti-communism, abolish democratic freedoms and persecute staunch patriotic and democratic people.
    The fourth manifestation of the Betancourt government's abandonment of its campaign platform and gradual shift to the right was that, in terms of foreign policy, it increasingly pursued a pro-American and anti-Cuban policy. It not only disregarded domestic opposition and brazenly signed the "Declaration of San José" plotted by the United States, but also increasingly actively acted as an accomplice to the United States in interfering with Cuba. Betancourt repeatedly publicly attacked the Cuban revolution.
    These actions of the Betancourt government cannot but arouse dissatisfaction and resistance among the broad masses of the people, deepening the domestic political crisis. Within the "coalition government," not only did the ministers of the Democratic Republican Union resign, but even the non-partisan Minister of Education resigned. A split also occurred within the Democratic Action Party led by Betancourt. A group of opposition members broke away from the Democratic Action Party as early as May of this year and formed a "Left-wing Revolutionary Movement." As for the Venezuelan Communist Party, which was excluded from the "coalition government," it has always stood at the forefront of maintaining national independence, defending democratic freedoms, strengthening national unity, demanding changes in the government's domestic and foreign policies, and striving to establish a truly patriotic and democratic coalition government. In July of this year, the Venezuelan Communist Party proposed several specific solutions to the crisis to the parties forming the "coalition government": restore the unity that existed during the overthrow of the Jiménez dictatorship, and in addition to the original four parties, representatives of the Left-wing Revolutionary Movement, the Workers' Confederation, and the University Students' Federation should be invited to participate in the parties' discussions on national political and economic issues; replace the cabinet; implement new national and economic policies, including developing the national economy, accelerating land reform, revising Venezuela's relations with major foreign investment companies, protecting national industries and their development, giving full play to the role of the newly established oil company, and taking measures to solve the basic problems affecting the masses of the people.
    However, the Betancourt government did not accept these suggestions, but instead intensified its repressive measures. As Pompeyo Márquez, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Venezuelan Communist Party and Senator, recently pointed out, "The government's violence, the statements and attitudes of the Democratic Action Party and its armed groups (regarding anti-communism and anti-people), have greatly promoted various factors that may lead the country to a civil war."
    American imperialism and the Venezuelan reactionaries are not satisfied with the Betancourt government's shift to the right thus far. They continue to exert pressure on it, intensify their plotting of coups and divisive conspiracies, and try to lead Venezuela back to the old road of the Jiménez era, which involved implementing dictatorial rule internally and completely succumbing to American imperialism externally. However, the Venezuelan people, who have the experience of overthrowing the Jiménez dictatorship and crushing countless coup conspiracies by American imperialism and its lackeys, have not only seen the brilliant achievements and bright prospects of national independence and national economic development achieved by relying on their own strength and on the unity and struggle of the people from the example of the Cuban revolution, but also seen the tragic consequences of political turmoil and economic bankruptcy from the Frondizi government of Argentina selling itself to the United States. Whether to take the road of Cuba or the road of Argentina is the focus of the struggle between progressive forces and reactionary forces in Venezuela today. All patriotic and democratic forces in Venezuela are reorganizing their forces, a new national democratic united front is taking shape, and the struggle against the Betancourt government's domestic and foreign policies and to strive for the formation of a truly national unity government is continuing to rise. Although this struggle will be long and complicated, as long as the Venezuelan people further strengthen unity and persist in struggle, they will surely be able to prevent the current government from shifting to the right and achieve the final victory of the national democratic struggle.

    委内瑞拉的政治危机
    章叶
    最近以来，委内瑞拉的政治局势处于严重的危机之中。学生和工人从11月25日开始的要求政府改变对内对外政策和抗议政府镇压暴行的斗争，继续在首都加拉加斯坚持中，并向内地各省扩展。
    贝坦科尔特是委内瑞拉人民推翻为期十年之久的希门尼斯亲美独裁政权之后，在1958年12月7日的总统选举中，作为民主行动党的总统候选人当选的。民主行动党是委内瑞拉一个最大的资产阶级政党，它代表着民族资产阶级的利益，同时在小资产阶级以至一部分农民中也有影响。两年前贝坦科尔特曾提出一项资产阶级民主改革的竞选纲领，保证尊重民主自由，限制美国垄断资本的活动，发展独立的民族工业，争取石油公司的大部分利润归国家所有，由国家控制委内瑞拉的石油资源以及实行庞大的公共工程计划来解决失业问题等。贝坦科尔特就是打着这样一个民主进步的幌子，得到一部分民族资产阶级和小资产阶级，特别是农民群众的支持当选的。
    但是，贝坦科尔特1959年2月13日就任总统后，由民主行动党、共和民主联盟、基督教社会党三党组织的“联合政府”，却把推翻希门尼斯独裁政权的重要政治力量之一的共产党排斥在外。参加政府的人不都是那些曾经参加反独裁政权斗争的人。这个“联合政府”基本上代表民族资产阶级利益，为首的又是民族资产阶级的右派。同时，在政府的成员中，也还有大资产阶级的代表，并在一定程度上代表某些大庄园主和小资产阶级的利益。这样一个政府同美国有矛盾的一面，也有一致的一面。而侵略成性的美帝国主义并不甘心于它在委内瑞拉的走狗希门尼斯独裁政权的垮台，甚至也并不喜欢这个至少在表面上还标榜着民族民主的“联合政府”，尤其是害怕委内瑞拉人民的觉醒、团结和坚持斗争以及委内瑞拉人民推翻独裁政权和建立宪法政府的胜利在拉丁美洲发生“不良”的影响。因此，美帝国主义千方百计地阻挡委内瑞拉沿着独立、民主和进步的道路前进。它一方面不断策动武装政变，以推翻委内瑞拉宪法政府；另一方面又利用委内瑞拉的经济困难，以“援助”为诱饵，迫使贝坦科尔特政府右转投降。
    在这样的内外因素的影响下，贝坦科尔特政府就背弃了它的竞选诺言，逐步走上反民族、反人民、反民主的道路。
    贝坦科尔特政府背弃竞选纲领，逐步右转倒退的第一个表现是，没有采取根本性措施来摆脱美国垄断资本的枷锁，独立发展民族经济，反而乞求美国“援助”以解救自己的经济困难。
    委内瑞拉是一个著名的生产石油的国家，石油生产仅次于美国而占世界第二位，石油出口为国家换回80％的外汇。但是，委内瑞拉的石油生产，几乎全部掌握在外国垄断资本主要是美国垄断资本手中。1958年12月，委内瑞拉军政府委员会曾颁布税收改革法，把外国公司缴纳的税额由50％增加到65％—70％。贝坦科尔特执政后，继续执行这个税法，这就使美国石油垄断组织要付给委内瑞拉更多的税款。美帝国主义为了保护它在委内瑞拉的石油利益，采取了一系列对委内瑞拉报复的措施，如宣布限制石油进口，降低石油销售价格，抽回在委内瑞拉的部分资金，裁减在委内瑞拉的石油公司工人并且扬言要封闭油田和停止公司营业等等。尽管贝坦科尔特政府为此同美帝国主义发生矛盾和展开一定程度的斗争，但也只限于执行新税法和成立了国家石油公司，在其他方面仍然屈从于华盛顿的压力。这表现在拖延同美国进行废止美委商约的谈判，向美国银行和国际货币基金组织寻求条件苛刻的贷款，欢迎外国垄断资本投资，不加区别地偿还希门尼斯独裁政权遗留的债务，企图冻结工资和放弃对石油化学、电力等基本工业的国家垄断。
    由于贝坦科尔特政府在摆脱美国垄断资本掠夺控制斗争中动摇、软弱以及幻想依靠美国的“援助”发展经济，它所执行的政策使委内瑞拉的经济情况日益恶化。目前，委内瑞拉货币流通量减少，外汇储备已从1958年年底的十亿多美元减少到今年3月的六千万美元。这种情况已经影响到生活费用的急剧上涨。由于新投资的减少、美国石油公司裁减员工和公共建设工程停建，在这一个只有六百五十万人口的国家中，失业人数已经超过了二十五万人。
    贝坦科尔特政府背弃竞选纲领，逐步右转倒退的第二个表现是，在竞选中赢得广大农民群众选票的土地改革的诺言，并没有真正兑现。在全国人民特别是农民的迫切要求下，贝坦科尔特在今年3月5日签署执行由国民大会批准的土地改革法。这项法律规定国家将把国有的土地和由国家征用的没有生产效能的大庄园的土地分配给农民，农民在取得土地时要付出一定的价款。这是一种非常不彻底的“土地改革”，既不能满足农民关于土地的要求，也丝毫不能动摇大庄园制的根基。况且根据贝坦科尔特政府的计划，需要二十五年才能完成。但是贝坦科尔特对于这样一个土地改革法至今未见认真实施。因而农民群众日益不满，继续展开了争取土地的斗争。
    贝坦科尔特政府背弃竞选纲领，逐步右转倒退的第三个表现是，对政变分子、残余的希门尼斯分子宽大，对武装部队和其他国家机关都没有经过清洗，而且在某种情况下，甚至对这些分子妥协让步，企图依靠军队的力量来维持政权。这就使得妥协投降分子在“联合政府”中日益得势，以至公开要求贝坦科尔特在反共的幌子下取消民主自由，迫害坚定的爱国民主人士。
    贝坦科尔特政府背弃竞选纲领，逐步右转倒退的第四个表现是，在对外政策方面越来越执行亲美和敌视古巴的政策。它不仅不顾国内人民的反对，悍然在美国所策划的“圣约瑟宣言”上画押，而且越来越积极地充当美国干涉古巴的帮凶。贝坦科尔特一再公开攻击古巴的革命。
    贝坦科尔特政府的这些做法，不能不引起广大人民的不满和反抗而使国内政治危机日益加深，在“联合政府”内，不仅共和民主联盟的部长们提出了辞职，连无党派的教育部长也提出辞职。而贝坦科尔特领导的民主行动党的内部也发生了分裂。一批反对派早在今年5月间就脱离了民主行动党，另组成一个“左派革命运动”。至于被排斥在“联合政府”之外的委内瑞拉共产党，一向站在维护民族独立、保卫民主自由、加强民族团结、要求改变政府对内对外政策和争取建立一个真正的爱国民主联合政府而斗争的最前列。今年7月，委内瑞拉共产党向组成“联合政府”的各政党提出几点解决危机的具体办法：恢复为推翻希门尼斯独裁政权时期的团结，除了原有的四个政党以外，并应邀请左派革命运动、工人联合会和大学生联合会的代表参加各政党讨论国家政治经济问题的会议；更换内阁；执行新的国家政策和经济政策，包括发展国民经济、加速实行土地改革、修改委内瑞拉同主要外国投资公司之间的关系、保护民族工业及其发展、发挥新成立的石油公司的作用、采取措施解决影响人民群众的基本问题。
    但是，贝坦科尔特政府并没有接受这些建议，而是加紧镇压措施。正像委内瑞拉共产党中央委员会政治局书记处书记、参议员庞佩约·马克斯最近指出的，“政府的暴力、民主行动党及它的武装集团（关于反共反人民）的声明和态度，大大地促进了可能把国家引导到一次国内战争的各种因素”。
    美帝国主义和委内瑞拉的反动派并不因贝坦科尔特政府到目前为止的右转倒退而满足，他们继续向它施加压力，加紧策划政变和分裂阴谋，力图把委内瑞拉引向希门尼斯时代对内实行独裁统治对外完全屈从美帝国主义的老路。但是，有着推翻希门尼斯独裁政权和无数次粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗政变阴谋斗争经验的委内瑞拉人民，既从古巴革命的例子看到依靠自己的力量，依靠人民的团结和斗争而取得的民族独立和民族经济发展的光辉成果和美好前景；也从阿根廷弗朗迪西政府卖身投靠美国看到政治动荡和经济破产的悲惨结果。走古巴的道路，还是走阿根廷的道路，正是今天委内瑞拉进步力量同反动势力斗争的焦点。委内瑞拉的一切爱国民主力量正在重新组织力量，新的民族民主的统一阵线正在形成，反对贝坦科尔特政府对内对外政策和争取组成真正的民族团结的政府的斗争，正在继续高涨。尽管这一斗争将是长期而复杂的，但是，只要委内瑞拉人民进一步加强团结，坚持斗争，就一定能够阻止现政府右转倒退而取得民族民主斗争的最后胜利。
