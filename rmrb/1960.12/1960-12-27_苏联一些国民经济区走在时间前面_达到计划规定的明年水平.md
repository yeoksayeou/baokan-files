Brotherly Countries Report Successes in Industrial Production at Year's End
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 25th: Soviet industrial enterprises are completing their production tasks for this year ahead of schedule. The dates by which many republics and states completed their plans ahead of schedule were earlier than originally guaranteed. The production of some national economic zones has already reached the level planned for 1961.
    Belarus's annual industrial production growth rate this year is 12%, with particularly large increases in the production of tractors, automobiles, automated production lines, and bearings. The Lithuanian Republic, the Uzbek Republic, and the Kazakh Republic have all completed their annual plans ahead of schedule.
    As a result of tapping potential, implementing technological innovations, and carrying out socialist labor competitions, some economic zones have not only completed their production tasks for this year ahead of schedule, but their production levels have also reached the levels planned for 1961 and 1962. For example, the famous Sverdlovsk economic zone in the Soviet Union completed its annual industrial production task ahead of schedule on December 20th, with an industrial output value 10.4% higher than last year, a labor productivity increase of 7.3%, and a total industrial output value already reaching the level planned for 1961 in the Seven-Year Plan. This has laid a good foundation for realizing its promise of completing the Seven-Year Plan in five years. The Leningrad economic zone also completed its annual industrial production task ahead of schedule, and its industrial production is currently ahead of schedule, reaching the level planned for 1962.
    This year, the national economic zones and states in the Soviet Union have also completed their tasks ahead of schedule in implementing technological innovations, manufacturing new products, and implementing mechanization and automation. The Moscow City economic zone manufactured more than 1,000 new types of machines and instruments this year, installed 280 automated and semi-automated production lines, and modernized 6,400 metal-cutting machine tools and other machines.
    At the beginning of this year, the industrial and mining enterprises in the national economic zones and states proposed to strive to improve production and accumulate "Seven-Year Plan funds" through rationalization proposals and inventions. Now, news of over-fulfillment of this task is coming from factories and mines everywhere.

    兄弟国家工业生产岁末报捷
    苏联一些国民经济区走在时间前面
    达到计划规定的明年水平
    据新华社莫斯科25日电　苏联工业企业正在纷纷提前完成今年的生产任务。许多共和国和州提前完成计划的日期都比原来的保证提早了。一些国民经济区的生产已经达到了计划规定的1961年的水平。
    白俄罗斯今年全年工业生产增长率是12％，拖拉机、汽车、自动化作业线、轴承等产品的产量，增长得特别多。立陶宛共和国、乌兹别克共和国、哈萨克共和国都分别提前完成了年度计划。
    由于挖掘潜力、进行技术革新和开展社会主义劳动竞赛的结果，一些经济区不仅提前完成了今年的生产任务，而且生产水平还达到了计划规定的1961、1962年的水平。例如，苏联著名的斯维德洛夫斯克经济区在12月20日提前完成了全年工业生产任务，工业产值比去年增长了10.4％，劳动生产率提高了7.3％，工业总产值已经达到七年计划规定的1961年的水平。这就为实现自己提出的五年完成七年计划的诺言打下了良好的基础。列宁格勒经济区也提前完成了全年的工业生产任务，目前它的工业生产则提前达到了计划规定的1962年的水平。
    今年，苏联各国民经济区和州在实现技术革新、制造新产品以及实行机械化和自动化方面，也都提前完成了任务。莫斯科市经济区今年制造了一千多种新型机器和仪器设备，安装了二百八十条自动化和半自动化作业线，并且把六千四百多台金属切削机床及其他机器现代化。
    在今年年初，各国民经济区和各州工矿企业曾纷纷提出要努力改进生产，用合理化建议和发明创造来积累“七年计划基金”。现在，各地的厂矿企业也纷纷传来超额完成这一任务的喜讯。
