Changsha, December 14th (Our Newspaper) - Wangyue People's Commune in Changsha County, Hunan Province, famous for pig raising, is currently actively carrying out cold and frost prevention work to ensure the safe overwintering of pigs and lay a good foundation for the development of pig production next year. In addition to exceeding the annual hog procurement target and selling a large number of piglets, the commune currently has 41,277 pigs in stock, an increase of 36% compared to the same period last year.

In cold and frost prevention work, the commune's Party committee first focused on the safe overwintering of pig farms in production teams and canteens, driving other aspects. Leading cadres from the commune and brigade personally went to the canteen pigsties to meticulously arrange the overwintering of pigs and improve winter feeding management methods. Currently, all 600-plus pig houses in the commune's canteen pig farms have been overhauled and repaired in advance, sufficient bedding grass has been prepared, more than 5 million catties of green fodder have been stored, and a fodder base of more than 1,000 mu has been established. The commune's supply and marketing department has also prepared fuel for cooking swill for canteen pig farms in winter. On the premise of grasping the cold and frost prevention and overwintering preparation work of production teams and canteen pig farms, the commune has also made proper arrangements for the overwintering of pigs in pig farms at all levels.

In terms of fodder reserves, as early as September and October, the commune launched a "vigorous green fodder storage campaign," collecting and storing more than 25 million catties of green fodder such as sweet potato vines, amaranth, kudzu vines, chestnuts, and silk grass, enough for pigs to get through the winter. At the same time, the entire commune seized the season to plant various fodders on more than 8,500 mu (utilizing some winter fallow fields), preparing fodder for the first quarter of next year. The commune also organized processing plants to process old bran and crop stalk husks, turning coarse fodder into refined feed. Refined feed is also managed by dedicated warehouses and personnel, with planned use. The entire commune has universally implemented the method of group feeding and specialized feeding, establishing special pens and fields for large pigs, small pigs, sows, and store pigs, which is convenient for breeders to take care of. In addition, Party organizations at all levels have strengthened education for breeders and strengthened epidemic prevention work.

While effectively arranging collective pig raising for the winter, the commune also provided certain care for commune members' private winter pig raising, allocating and selling appropriate refined feed and straw at a price, allocating a small amount of private plot, and allowing commune members to plant fodder in their spare time, ensuring that privately raised pigs can also safely overwinter.

(Our Newspaper) Xun - Yangdu People's Commune in Wuyang District, Zhong County, Sichuan Province, is seizing the transformation of third-category pigs in the same way as seizing the transformation of third-category seedlings of crops. After more than a month of concentrated efforts, the original 252 third-category pigs have all been upgraded to first and second-category pigs.

In the movement to transform third-category pigs, the commune's Party committee and the secretaries in charge of pig raising in the thirteen management district branches all personally participated in this work. Tao Wenjun, the secretary of the commune's Party committee, was in the same He Management District, which had a total of ten third-category pigs. After he and the breeder carefully fed them, they were upgraded as early as November 5th. Tan Zhongbing, the director of the commune, also contracted to feed two third-category pigs in the Yudong Management District. The example of the cadres greatly encouraged the commune members and enhanced their confidence and determination to eliminate third-category pigs.

In the movement to transform third-category pigs, the entire commune contracted more than 200 third-category pigs to more than 130 Party members, Youth League members, and model breeders for feeding, and established a responsibility system and an incentive system. Under their feeding of "quantitative refined feed and fully inflated roughage," with large pigs being fed evenly three times a day and small pigs being fed four times a day, the pigs gradually gained weight. In order to strengthen the feeding management of sick and weak pigs, the entire commune also established 76 "nutrition yards" to implement group feeding. After careful feeding, all 25 third-category pigs in the commune that were lying down and unable to get up have been upgraded to second-category pigs. The commune's animal husbandry and health station also played a significant role in the transformation of third-category pigs. All station personnel were stationed in fixed locations to contract for epidemic prevention and treatment.

In order to strengthen the work of transforming third-category pigs, the commune and management district specially organized inspection teams to go deep into the pig farms of various production teams and public canteens to supervise and inspect and continuously carry out on-site evaluations. Where there is advanced experience, on-site meetings are held to spread advanced experience. In the on-site evaluation, 48 breeders were rated as model breeders for transforming third-category pigs.

    翻盖修整栅圈　备足饲料垫草　推行分群饲养
    望岳公社猪只过冬安排周到
    洋渡公社加强饲养管理，三类猪全部上升为一、二类猪
    本报长沙14日电　以养猪闻名的湖南省长沙县望岳人民公社，目前正积极作好防寒防冻工作，保证猪安全过冬，并为明年发展生猪打好基础。这个公社，目前除已超额完成全年肥猪征购任务、售出大批仔猪外，现有存栏猪四万一千二百七十七头，比去年同期存栏数增长36％。
    在防寒防冻工作中，公社党委首先抓住生产队和食堂的猪场安全过冬工作，带动其他方面。公社、大队的领导干部亲自下到食堂猪栏，细致安排生猪过冬工作，改进冬季的饲养管理方法。目前，全社食堂养猪场的六百多栋猪舍均已提前翻盖、修整好，备足了垫栏草，贮存了五百多万斤青饲料，并建立了饲料基地一千多亩。公社供销部门还为食堂养猪场准备了冬天煮潲用的燃料。在抓好生产队和食堂养猪场的防寒防冻过冬准备工作的前提下，公社还对各级猪场生猪过冬都作了妥善安排。
    饲料的储备方面，早在9、10月间，公社开展了一次“大搞青贮饲料运动”，采集贮藏了红薯藤、洋苋菜和葛藤、栗子、丝草等青饲料达二千五百多万斤，足够生猪越冬需要。同时全社抢季节种下各种饲料八千五百多亩（利用了部分冬闲田），为明年一季度作好了饲料准备。公社还组织加工厂，将老糠、作物秆壳进行加工，变粗饲料为精饲料。对精饲料也建立了专仓专人管理，计划使用。全社普遍推行了分群分栏、专人饲养的办法，建立了大猪、小猪、母猪、架子猪等专栏专场，便于饲养员照料。此外，各级党组织加强了对饲养员的教育和加强了防疫工作。
    这个公社在切实安排集体养猪过冬的同时，对社员私人冬季养猪也给予了一定的照顾，作价配售了适当的精饲料和稻草，划给少量自留地，允许社员在业余时间内种植饲料，保证社员私人养的猪同样能安全越冬。
    本报讯　四川忠县乌羊区洋渡人民公社像抓紧改造庄稼三类苗一样，抓紧改造三类猪。经过最近一个多月的突击，原来的二百五十二头三类猪，全部上升为一、二类猪。
    在改造三类猪的运动中，公社党委和十三个管理区支部管养猪工作的书记，都亲自参加这一工作。公社党委书记陶文均所在的同合管理区共有十头三类猪，经过他和饲养员耐心饲养，早在11月5日就升了级。公社主任谭中兵在鱼洞管理区也包喂了两头三类猪。干部的榜样，给社员们鼓舞很大，增强了他们消灭三类猪的信心和决心。
    在改造三类猪运动中，全社把二百多头三类猪包给一百三十多个党、团员和模范饲养员喂养，并建立了责任制度和奖励制度。在他们的“精料定量、粗料尽胀”，大猪每天分三顿喂匀，小猪每天喂四顿的饲养下，猪只逐渐增膘。为了加强病弱猪的饲养管理，全社还建立了七十六个“营养院”，实行分群喂养。经过精心饲养，全社二十五头倒卧不起的三类猪，已全部升为二类猪。公社的畜牧保健站在改造三类猪中，也发挥了显著作用。全站人员驻点分片包干防疫治病。
    为了加强改造三类猪工作，公社和管理区专门组织了检查组，深入各生产队、公共食堂的猪场督促检查和不断开展现场评比。那里先进，就在那里召开现场会，传播先进经验。在现场评比中，有四十八个饲养员，被评为改造三类猪的模范饲养员。
