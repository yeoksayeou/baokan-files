    Pioneering a Land of Flowers and Fruits
    Wang Hailiang, Guo Duanyou
    Orchards sway green waves in the wind,
    Cabbages grin, showing their teeth,
    Flowers lean on fences, garlic covers the ground,
    Fruits ripen among branches in garden plots,
    Looks like an orchard, yet resembles a field,
    So many wonders inside this garden field.
    This is a paean sung by the broad masses of commune members of the Shili Pu Production Brigade, Gongdian People’s Commune, Ye County, Henan, about the forest farm at the village head. Anyone who doesn't know this forest farm wouldn't imagine that just last winter, this was a barren land piled with stones and bricks; nobody would have thought that six white-haired old men could turn this wasteland into an orchard.
    "Where there's a will, there's a way to overcome difficulties in pioneering." This saying is absolutely true. Last winter, after Zhao Wenhua, Ma Ke, and Zhao Wenhai, three old men, were demobilized from the commune's forest farm and returned to the village, they got together for a chat. They all wanted to make their village as green as the nearby Tang Village and Rufendian Village: "Trees (persimmons) shade the sky before and behind the village, flowers and fruit trees line the houses and roads, fruits are available all year round, and commune members live happily ever after." It's a golden village, a silver manor! Who wouldn't envy that! They gathered the local Zhao Wenshou, Wang Qingyi, Li Dayun, and other old men to discuss the matter of reclaiming wasteland and cultivating seedlings. Just at this time, the Party once again called for planting trees on a large scale. Yuan Qingxiang, the Party branch secretary of the brigade, discussed with these old men how to cultivate seedlings. This exactly suited the wishes of the six old men, and they shared their idea of reclaiming wasteland to cultivate fruit seedlings. Yuan Qingxiang said: "That's great!" You are all older, more knowledgeable, and more experienced. You can give guidance and advice, and the young men can do the wasteland reclamation." The old men said: "The young men are the strong labor force, let them focus on farming the land and producing more grain. We will take care of planting trees." From then on, these old men, who had suffered the vicissitudes of the old society, were full of energy. That day, they walked around the village and selected a piece of wasteland in the north of the village. The next morning, they carried their tools and started to reclaim the wasteland. When Yuan Qingxiang heard about it, he rushed to say: "You are all old, so you should find a piece of land closer to cultivate seedlings."
      "The land near the village is all cultivated land! The cultivated land should be used to grow crops, and just open up a wasteland for cultivating seedlings." Zhao Wenhua pointed to the wasteland on the west side of the farm and said, "Secretary Yuan, we have discussed opening up this large piece of idle land to cultivate fruit seedlings." Yuan Qingxiang knew that this wasteland used to be a residential area. It was not only uneven with ridges and depressions, piles of rubble, but also had difficult-to-dig stones and difficult-to-uproot tree roots underground. In the middle, there was also a north-south ditch that was five feet deep. It would be a major project to turn this piece of land into a seedling field. Yuan Qingxiang said: "This piece of land must be utilized, but it's a big project and heavy work to open up this wasteland. Why don't you find a piece of land to till!" The old men insisted on opening it up, saying: "We may be old, but our ambition is not old. We will open up this wasteland sooner or later!" Seeing that the old men were very determined, Yuan Qingxiang had no choice but to specifically tell them to rest more, take care of their health, and go home to rest when they were tired.
    Winter passed and spring came. When all things sprouted, this wasteland had already become a garden field as flat as a carpet and as straight as a line. In order to prevent calves, pigs, and chickens from running in and digging up the ridges, the old men started to build a wall on the side near the village and erected fences in other places. Where there's a will, there's a way to overcome difficulties in pioneering. This wasteland, which had been idle for decades, became a treasure in the hands of the old men.
    In order to collect seeds, people could often see Zhao Wenshou, Zhao Wenhai, Wang Qingyi in the forests of villages dozens of miles around, such as Wencun, Rufendian, Gengwan, and Tangcun. They often carried dry food and went to the forests to look for seeds everywhere. During a winter, they ran around and collected about 900 catties of peach kernels, soft jujubes, toon seeds, neem seeds, locust seeds, etc. The primary school students in the village gave the fruit seeds they usually collected to the old men. The children also composed songs and sang: "Grandpas are heroes, better than the old Huang Zhong, determined to plant orchards, braving the cold to collect seeds of happiness!"
    Collecting seeds of happiness, cultivating seedlings of happiness. People are full of confidence in the realization of the long-term plan for this forest farm, and they cherish and support the forest farm very much. When the seedling cultivation season arrived, it was a critical period for managing wheat fields. There were few laborers in the village, and Yuan Qingxiang couldn't spare anyone several times. Later, he asked the cook to help the old men in his spare time. When the buds came out and it was time to sow, there were even fewer people. Fifty to sixty thousand peach and persimmon seedlings, and dozens of ridges of tree seeds, had to be sown in the ground within ten days or so. In order to seize the season for sowing, Yuan Qingxiang was busy with production during the day and helped them sow seeds at night.
    "There is gold in the soil, waiting for diligent people." This is what these old men often say. They cherish every piece of land and use every place where tree seedlings are not planted to grow cotton and sweet potatoes on a large scale, and cabbage and radishes on a small scale. Later, when the Party called for growing vegetables on a large scale, they applied base fertilizer to all the tree seedlings and planted radishes and cabbages. The whole garden was truly utilized to the fullest. After autumn, their bean stalks were piled high. This was because they planted some beans when they saw holes in the cabbage and radishes that were infested with insects, and they harvested a lot. After a few gourds were weeded out, they quickly planted garlic, and also planted garlic among the flowers and plants on both sides of the road. This summer, the peach seedlings are as tall as a man, and the persimmon seedlings are up to the knees, with lush leaves and straight stalks. The vegetables on the ridge are tender green and cover the ground. It's true: The green forest laughs, the vegetable seedlings grow, the vegetable seedlings are even more flourishing than the green forest. The six old men are determined to turn Shili Pu into a land of flowers and fruits.

    开创花果之乡
    王海亮　郭端猷
    果林迎风荡绿波，
    白菜咧嘴笑呵呵，
    鲜花依篱蒜铺地，
    林畦枝间结硕果，
    看是果园又似田，
    园田里边奇事多。
    这是河南叶县公店人民公社十里铺生产大队广大社员对村头林场唱的一首赞歌。不知道这个林场过去的人，谁也不会想到就在去年冬天，这里还是一片堆满了石头、砖块的荒地；谁也不会想到这是六位白发苍苍的老人把荒地变成了果林的。
    “有志不怕创业难”。这句话一点不假。去年冬天，赵文华、马科、赵文海三位老人从公社林场下放回村后，他们聚在一起闲谈，都很想把自己的村子绿化得像附近的棠村、汝坟店那样：“村前村后树（柿）遮天，宅旁道边花果园，一年四季果不断，社员生活乐无边”。这是金村银庄啊，谁不羡慕！他们找本村的赵文收、王清义、李大运等老人合计开荒育苗的事。恰在这时候，党又一次号召大种树木。大队党支书袁庆祥同志找这几位老人商量怎样育苗。这正合了六位老人的心愿，他们把开荒地育果苗的想法说了，袁庆祥说：“那太好了！”您们几位上了年纪，见识广，经验多，你们多动动嘴，指导指导，开荒的事由小伙子们干吧。”老人们说：“小伙子们是壮劳力，让他们把地种好多打粮食，种树的事我们几个包了。”从此，这几位在旧社会饱受风霜的老人劲头可足啦。当天他们就绕着村子转了一圈，在村北选定了一块荒地，第二天一早就扛着家具动手开荒。袁庆祥听说后忙赶去说：“您们岁数大了，还是找块近地育苗吧。”
      “村边上的地都是熟地啊！熟地留着种庄稼吧，育树苗开个荒片就行。”赵文华指着场西边的荒片说：“袁书记，俺几个合计把这一大片闲地全开出来育上果苗。”袁庆祥知道这片荒地过去原是宅地，这里不但岗洼不平，瓦砾成堆，而且地下还有难挖的石块，难刨的树根，中间还横着个深达五尺的南北沟，要把这片地整修成果苗地，工程较大。袁庆祥说：“这片地是一定要利用起来的，不过开这片荒，工程大、活重，还是找片场地翻翻吧！”几位老人坚持要开，他们说：“俺们人老志不老，早晚要把这片荒地开出来！”袁庆祥看老人们非常坚决，也只好特意关照老人们多休息，保重身体，累了就回家歇歇。
    冬去春来，当万物发芽时，这块荒地已经变成地平如毯，畦直如线的园田了。为了防止牛犊猪鸡常跑进去扒毁畦埂，老人们又动手在靠村子的一边筑墙，其它的地方扎篱笆。有志不怕创业难，这块闲了几十年的荒地，在几位老人手里变成宝地了。
    为了采集树种，人们经常可以在文村、汝坟店、耿弯、棠村等方圆几十里的村庄树林里，看到赵文收、赵文海、王清义，他们常常带着干粮，白天上树林到处寻找种子。一个冬季，他们东奔西跑采集了桃核、软枣、椿子、楝树种、槐子等九百来斤。村上的小学生都把自己平时收集的果种送给老人。孩子们并编歌唱道：“老爷爷是英雄，胜过当年老黄忠，立志要栽花果园，冒寒采集幸福种！”
    采得幸福种，育上幸福苗。人们对这林场的远景规划的实现，充满了信心，都很爱护林场，支持林场。到了育苗时节，正是管理麦田的关键时期，村上劳力少，袁庆祥几次抽不出人，后来叫炊事员抽空帮助老人。等芽子出来下种的时候，人手更显得少了。五六万棵桃秧柿苗，几十畦树种都得在十来天内下到地里。为了抢季节下种，袁庆祥白天忙着生产，晚上帮他们下种。
    “土里有黄金，单等勤快人”。这是常挂在这几位老人嘴上的话。他们珍视一块一片土地，把没下树秧的地方都利用起来，大片种上了棉花、红薯，小片种上了白菜、萝卜。后来党号召大种蔬菜，他们就把所有的树苗中间施上底肥，点上萝卜、白菜，满园里真是寸土不闲。秋后他们的豆秆垛堆得老高。这是他们在白菜、萝卜生虫时，见坑补苗种了一点豆子，谁知收了许多。几棵东瓜薅了，他们就赶忙种上了蒜，并且在路两旁花草间也种上蒜。今年夏天，桃树秧埋人，柿树秧没膝，叶茂杆直，背垅的蔬菜嫩绿铺地，真是：绿林笑，青菜苗长，菜苗更比绿林旺。六位老人，决心把十里铺变成花果之乡。
