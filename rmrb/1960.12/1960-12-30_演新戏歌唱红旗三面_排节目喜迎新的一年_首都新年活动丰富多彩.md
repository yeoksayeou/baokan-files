Xinhua News Agency, 29th: On the eve of the New Year, the people of the capital are joyously welcoming the arrival of 1961.

This year, New Year's celebration activities in various grassroots units in Beijing are diverse. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company will screen movies in each dormitory area, and amateur troupes will also perform programs they have rehearsed themselves. Each workshop and dormitory area will have small-scale get-togethers, games, and other activities. Veteran workers of the company will tell revolutionary stories to young workers at small gatherings. Leading cadres of each workshop at the Liulihe Cement Plant will celebrate New Year's Eve with the workshop's employees and their families. Students at Tsinghua University are already preparing to hold a rich and colorful evening party, and are preparing a "Grand View Garden" with fifty kinds of games. Many schools, such as Peking University and Renmin University of China, will hold small-scale literary and art evenings and symposiums by class. Teachers and students will gather together to perform small and diverse literary and artistic programs that they have compiled themselves, praising the Three Red Banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, as well as the Party's education policy, talk about the achievements of the past year, and look forward to the New Year. More than 1,000 students from over 40 ethnic groups at the Central Institute for Nationalities are rehearsing ethnic literary and artistic programs. The children of emancipated serfs from Tibet are especially joyous, celebrating their first New Year in the capital since the democratic reforms in their hometown. Many urban people's communes will screen movies and hold parties during the New Year.

Various cultural centers in Beijing's urban and suburban areas have arranged many cultural and artistic activities. The Dongcheng District Cultural Center and Workers' Club will organize a "Small Tianqiao" activity featuring storytelling, stringed instrument playing, and singing, and will screen daytime slides. The Changxindian People's Commune in Fengtai District will hold exhibitions such as "Long Live the Three Red Banners" and "Strive for a Bumper Harvest in 1961" for farmers during the New Year. To meet the needs of the vast number of readers during the New Year, the Capital Library delivered 200,000 books to key factories, mines, and schools before the festival. Many unit libraries are open as usual during the New Year, and librarians in many grassroots units also deliver books to people's homes to facilitate reading.

During the New Year, the vast number of Beijing citizens can enjoy a variety of wonderful literary and artistic programs through radio and television. The Central People's Broadcasting Station has recently prepared a literary broadcast "Welcoming the New Year" and a special New Year's Eve broadcast composed of a large number of light and lively musical pieces. Citizens can also listen to the "New Year Radio Concert" performed by artistic groups and music art schools in the capital and other places; listen to recordings of Peking Opera and Kunqu Opera performed by Mei Lanfang, Ouyang Yuqian, and Du Jinfang; as well as excellent program recordings and clips of local operas such as Qian Opera, Lu Opera, Chao Opera, and Xi Opera. Beijing TV has specially organized a "TV Riddle Guessing Competition" for children, so that they can enjoy dramas and guess riddles at the same time.

From New Year's Eve to the five days after the New Year, theaters will screen an average of 300 films per day, selecting and showing more than 50 Chinese and foreign films. Among them are 11 films newly released in Beijing, including the feature film "Rapid Currents," which reflects the great victory of the mass movement on the industrial front, and the Yue Opera art film "Dou Shi Ting," which tells the story of three rural girls winning high cotton yields. In order to celebrate the second anniversary of the Cuban Revolution, the color feature documentary "Fighting Cuba," which reflects the storm of the Cuban people's anti-imperialist struggle, will be screened during the New Year.

Many professional literary and art troupes in the capital, such as drama, music, and dance troupes, will perform more than 150 performances in theaters and workers' clubs in urban and suburban areas during the six days before and after the New Year, with rich and colorful programs. Among them is the large-scale historical drama "Young Phoenix Soaring to the Sky," newly rehearsed by young actors who graduated from the Beijing Opera School. This is based on a fragment from the traditional opera "Generals of the Yang Family," enriched and re-edited. The China Peking Opera Theater will perform excellent repertoire such as "The White Haired Girl" and "She Saihua." The opera "Storm on the Yangtze River," written by the great musician Nie Er, will be staged again by the Central Experimental Opera House. The Central Philharmonic Orchestra will perform a set of music from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Many professional troupes, such as the China Peking Opera Theater and the China Ping Opera Theater, will also go deep into some large factories and mines to give performances to express their regards.

During the holidays, the Palace Museum, the Natural History Museum, the Lu Xun Memorial Hall, and the Labor Protection Exhibition Hall will also be open as usual.
