    Upon entering the spacious and clean workshop of the Cambodia-China Friendship Textile Factory, one can see that all the machines are in operation and production is in full swing. Cambodian female workers, dressed in various colors of tight-fitting shirts and sarongs (skirts worn by Cambodian women) or trousers, skillfully operate the machines. Currently, they produce 2,000 kilograms of cotton yarn and 10,000 meters of cotton cloth daily, meeting the needs of the Cambodian people. Built with Chinese economic assistance, this textile factory is a symbol of the profound friendship between the people of China and Cambodia, and the first batch of Cambodian female workers growing up here is a direct testament to this sincere friendship.

    A person visiting the Cambodia-China Friendship Textile Factory in Kampong Cham for the first time would find it hard to imagine that this modern factory, with over 11,000 spindles and 210 automatic looms, has only been officially in production for two or three months, and the average length of service for the workers is three months, with the longest being no more than half a year. In early May of this year, Premier Zhou Enlai, during his second visit to Cambodia, was invited to preside over the symbolic opening ceremony for the factory. At that time, only a few machines in the workshop were operating for trial production. Later, batches of workers came to the factory, and under the training of Chinese experts and technicians, they mastered the operating techniques. In September, the factory began formal production in two shifts. Currently, all production in the factory is handled by Cambodian workers themselves, with Chinese experts and technicians only providing assistance on critical or a few difficult issues. Cambodian workers say with confidence, "Now, we can also produce independently." This is such an exciting fact! Just as Premier Zhou Enlai said when cutting the ribbon for the factory: "The completion of the Kampong Cham Textile Factory not only shows the determination of the Cambodian people, under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk, to develop their own national industry, but also shows that the Cambodian people have the ability to develop their own national industry."

    During the eighty years of colonial rule in Cambodia, when Cambodia was subjected to imperialist exploitation and plunder, Cambodians were not only unable to establish any national industry, but were also deprived of the right to be technical workers. In the few French colonial authorities or private industrial enterprises, only foreigners were employed. Western colonialists slandered Cambodians as "stupid" and "lazy," only fit to be "coolies." But history has ruthlessly exposed these shameless slanders. With the help of friendly countries, Cambodia has not only rapidly built some modern factories, but also created the first batch of modern industrial technical forces, proving that Cambodians are hardworking and intelligent. In the process of overcoming difficulties and mastering technology, Cambodian workers have shown great determination and effort. During our visit to this factory, we were deeply moved by some touching facts.

    In early May of this year, the factory recruited the first batch of female workers from schools and rural areas. Accustomed to household labor, Cambodian women were not only completely unfamiliar with machines, but also unaccustomed to standing in front of machines to work. Some female workers recalled the situation at that time, telling us: "At that time, how much we wanted to sit on the smooth floor of the workshop to rest!" But the vast majority of workers persevered, and some continued to work even when their legs were swollen. In this way, they overcame the first difficulty of adapting to industrial production. Now, they are all competently standing in front of the machines, tending them.

    Two female workers from China who were sent to the factory to help told us the following story:

    Among the first batch of female workers recruited, there was a quiet and beautiful girl with long, sharp fingernails on her slender hands. Her name was Mok Dou Ean, and she was originally a middle school student. When she first learned to join broken cotton yarn ends, she found it difficult to join ten ends in one minute, and she fell behind others in several tests. Each time, she felt very sad. Later, she asked the Chinese female workers to help her find the reason. The Chinese female workers sincerely told her that her fingernails were too long, and each time the yarn wrapped around her fingers, it would slip off, thus affecting the improvement of her efficiency. Mok Dou Ean immediately found scissors and cut off all ten fingernails without saying a word. For this girl, this was a considerable determination. After work, she also took some cotton yarn to practice joining ends during her rest time, and her work efficiency quickly improved significantly. Soon, she was sent to learn to be a helper, which required higher technical skills. However, in the test of removing substandard defective cloth, she fell behind some of her companions again. She had stood alone by the machine several times, pondering hard. She was determined to study hard and practice diligently. So, every day before starting work, she would quietly sneak into the workshop, put a watch next to her, and start a tense self-test practice. In this way, she sacrificed her sleep time, improved the efficiency of removing defective cloth, and caught up with others. Her efficiency in removing six-inch-long defective cloth was reduced from one hour to half an hour, and finally to about twenty seconds. When we walked to the weaving workshop, she was removing defective cloth, and her movements were so agile, skilled, and accurate. Now, she can watch forty-eight machines that weave patterned cloth, which require higher technical skills; and the speed of removing six-inch-long defective cloth has long exceeded twenty seconds. When she saw us, she gave us a combined palm salute with the shyness and gentleness characteristic of Cambodian girls. She told us that yesterday a helper took leave, and she automatically replaced her work, watching ninety machines alone. Although it was very hard, she was very happy in her heart. She said that she was proud to be one of the first Cambodian textile workers; because the products of her factory can supply the people of her own country, she was excited. She said to us: "The improvement of our technology is the result of the patient and unreserved help of Chinese male and female experts." In this way, she tenaciously mastered the technology, demonstrating the determination and ability of the Cambodian people to develop national industry.

    In the same workshop, we met the weaving female worker Ye Cai Ni, whom we had met half a year ago. At that time, she and several newly arrived female workers were learning to drive a loom around an empty loom. In the blink of an eye, Ye Cai Ni, who appeared in front of us, was already a skilled worker managing eighteen looms. We smiled and greeted each other with a combined palm salute. She told us that after that training to drive a loom, she could watch one loom in more than ten days, four looms in twenty days, and eight looms in a month and a half. By the time formal production began at the end of September, she was already able to watch eighteen looms.

    The Chinese female worker Zhang Xiuying, who accompanied us on the visit, praised the intelligence and efforts of the Cambodian female workers more than once. She said that at the beginning, the average female worker could not join three or four yarn ends in one minute, and she had envisioned setting the initial requirement at fifteen yarn ends per minute. But two weeks later, Cambodian female workers generally reached eighteen ends per minute. The technical level of the existing twelve helpers can also be described as skilled workers.

    We came to the spinning workshop. Here, everything was in good order, the tending workers nimbly walked between the machines, sweeping the fluff from the machines and joining broken ends; the cleaners were cleaning the floor again and again. We met Ge Mulang, a lively Cambodian girl. We had known each other for a long time. During a visit to this workshop in May, we saw her learning to tend the machines in a flurry; the cotton yarn seemed to be deliberately teasing her, constantly breaking ends, and she couldn't take care of one while taking care of the other. But now, Ge Mulang has become the master of the machine, she can watch one and a half machines, a total of six hundred and thirty-six spindles, and has also explored some experiences. For example, she adopted the "pagoda-shaped yarn changing method" named by herself, which can orderly replace the roving, avoiding the need to change the roving squeezed together, so as not to affect the joining of ends. Ge Mulang told us that she not only did this herself, but also introduced this method to new companions.

    Just then, another Chinese female worker, Wang Xiuzhen, who accompanied us, pointed to a slender Cambodian girl and introduced to us: she works the middle shift, she is supposed to go to work at 2 pm, but she came to do cleaning work at 7 am. We talked to her. It turned out that their middle shift had a lower output than the early shift yesterday, and she was so anxious that she couldn't sleep. In order to catch up with the early shift, she decided to go to the workshop first to do the cleaning work, so that everyone could do a good job, which could reduce the breaking of ends and improve the quality. She told us that her name was Suo Gaomu, originally a third-year middle school student, and she was only seventeen years old this year. Because she liked being a technical worker, she decided to give up her studies and enter the factory. Like her, there are several middle school students in this workshop who volunteered to be workers.

    In the past six months, more than 600 production workers have been trained in this factory, including textile workers, weaving workers, maintenance workers, and electricians. New workers are still being trained. They are working proudly, especially when they know that their products are welcomed by the majority of the people, that kind of happiness is even more indescribable.

    In contact with them, we deeply feel that the close friendship between them and the Chinese technical personnel cannot be measured by the general understanding of friendship. As early as May, when we visited this factory, which had not yet officially started, they were looking forward to the early arrival of Chinese textile female workers to teach them technology, just like looking forward to the stars and the moon. When the two Chinese female workers arrived in Kampong Cham, it was the season when the fragrant white orchids were in full bloom. Every day after work, the pockets of the aprons worn by the Chinese female workers were filled with this fragrant flower. This is what the Cambodian female workers quietly put in their pockets. The Chinese female workers repeatedly expressed their thanks, but they were unsuccessful. The Cambodian female workers said: We have nothing to give you, we can only use these fresh flowers that grow in our own homes to express our deep gratitude to China. The lively Suo Gaomu once told us her mood, she said that she can't sleep well when she encounters difficulties in learning technology. Because she felt that if she didn't work hard to study, how could she repay China's help to Cambodia? She excitedly took our hands and said: "May the friendship between China and Cambodia continue to develop, and be as close as sisters." Electrician workshop director Weng Che'en also expressed his gratitude to the Chinese experts, he said: "The Chinese experts taught us, who didn't even know how to connect wires at the beginning, to master complex electrical engineering technology. This is too meaningful for Cambodia's own industrial construction."

    After bidding farewell to this factory, our hearts were still very excited, and we couldn't help but think of what Premier Zhou Enlai said at the opening ceremony of this factory: "As long as we are determined, rely on our own hardworking hands, and rely on the mutual assistance and cooperation of friendly countries, we will definitely be able to build our country step by step. What Western countries can do, we Asian and African countries can also do." Isn't that the truth? Looking at the endless rice fields outside the car window, and thinking of the hardworking and intelligent Cambodian workers we had just visited, we believe that a modern Cambodian country will soon appear on this fertile land.

    第一批柬埔寨女工
    新华社记者　张瑶
    一进柬中友谊纺织厂宽敞而整洁的车间，人们就可以看到全部机器都在运转，生产在紧张地进行。穿着各种颜色的紧身衬衣和沙笼（柬埔寨妇女着的裙）或长裤的柬埔寨女工们在机器旁边熟练地操作着。现在她们每天生产二千公斤棉纱和一万米棉布，供应柬埔寨人民的需要。用中国经济援助建设起来的这座纺织厂是中柬两国人民深厚友谊的象征，在这里成长着的柬埔寨第一批女工是这种真诚的友谊的直接的见证。
    一个初次到磅湛参观柬中友谊纺织厂的人，很难猜想得出，这座拥有一万一千多个纱锭和二百一十台自动布机的现代化工厂，才正式投入生产两、三个月，工人的普遍工龄是三个月，最长的也不过半年。今年5月初，周恩来总理第二次访问柬埔寨时，应邀为这座工厂主持了象征性的开幕典礼。那时车间里只有几部机器在开动，进行试验性生产。以后，一批批的工人来到了工厂，在中国专家和技术人员的培训下，掌握了操作技术。9月份，这个工厂就分两班开始了正式生产。目前厂里的生产已全部由柬埔寨工人自己掌握，中国专家和技术人员只在关键性或少数困难问题上给予帮助。柬埔寨工人充满信心地说，“现在，我们也可以独立生产了。”这是一个多么令人兴奋的事实！正像周恩来总理为这个工厂剪彩时所说的那样：“磅湛纺织厂的建成，不仅说明柬埔寨人民在西哈努克亲王的领导下，有发展自己民族工业的决心，而且也说明了柬埔寨人民有发展自己民族工业的能力。”
    在柬埔寨备受帝国主义剥削和掠夺的八十多年殖民统治期间，柬埔寨人不仅不可能建立任何民族工业，而且也被剥夺了做技术工人的权利。在仅有的几家法国殖民当局或私人工业企业里，都只雇用外国人。西方殖民主义者诬蔑柬埔寨人“愚蠢”、“懒惰”，只配当“苦力”。但是历史多么无情地揭穿了这些无耻诬蔑。在友好国家的帮助下，柬埔寨不仅迅速地建成了一些现代化工厂，也造就了第一批现代工业的技术力量，证明了柬埔寨人是勤劳而智慧的。在克服困难、掌握技术的过程中，柬埔寨工人表现了很大的决心和努力。我们在访问这个工厂时，深深地为一些动人的事实所感动。
    今年5月初，工厂由学校和农村招来了第一批女工。习惯于家务劳动的柬埔寨妇女，不仅对机器是完全陌生的，而且对于站在机器面前工作也不习惯。有的女工回忆当时的情形告诉我们：“那时多想坐在车间里光滑的地板上休息啊！”但是绝大多数工人坚持下来了，有的腿肿了也照样干。就这样，她们打破了第一个适应工业生产的难关。现在，她们个个胜任愉快地站在机器面前，挡着车。
    中国派到工厂去帮助工作的两位女工告诉了我们这样一个故事：
    在第一批招来的女工中，有一个娴静而漂亮的姑娘，纤细的双手上留着长长尖尖的指甲。她名叫木豆茵，原是中学生。在刚学接棉纱断头时，她要在一分钟内接十个头都觉得很困难，在几次测验中都落在别人的后面。每次，她感到很难过。后来她要求中国女工帮助她寻找原因，中国女工诚恳地告诉她，她的指甲太长，每次纱绕在指头上就滑脱了，因此影响效率的提高。木豆茵一声不响地马上找来剪刀，把十个指甲剪短了。对于这位姑娘来说，这样作是下了相当大的决心的。下工后，她还拿一些棉纱利用休息时间练习接头，她的工作效率很快地有了显著的提高。不久，她被派去学做技术要求较高的帮接工。但是在测验拆除不合质量的坏布中，她又落在一些同伴的后面了。她曾经好几次一个人站在机器旁边苦苦地思索着。她下决心勤学苦练。于是，每天在开工之前，她就悄悄溜进车间，把一只手表放在旁边，开始了紧张的自我测验练习。就这样，她牺牲自己的睡眠时间，提高了拆坏布的效率，赶上了别人。她拆六寸长坏布的效率由原来的一个小时，缩短到半小时，最后只要二十秒钟左右。当我们走到织布车间时，她正在拆坏布，动作是那样敏捷、熟练而准确。现在，她一个人能看四十八台技术要求较高的织花纹布的机器；而拆六寸长坏布的速度又早已突破了二十秒。她看到我们后，以柬埔寨少女特有的羞怯和温柔的表情向我们合十敬礼。她告诉我们，昨天一个帮接工请假了，她自动代替了她的工作，一个人看了九十台机器。虽然很辛苦，但是她心里很高兴。她说，她以自己能成为柬埔寨第一批纺织工人而骄傲；因为自己工厂的产品能供应本国人民而兴奋。她向我们说：“我们技术的提高是中国男女专家耐心和无保留地帮助的结果。”就是这样，她顽强地掌握了技术，表现了柬埔寨人民要求发展民族工业的决心和能力。
    在同一个车间里，我们遇见了半年前我们曾经见过面的挡车女工叶采尼。当时，她和几个刚进厂的女工正围着一台空布机在学开车。曾几何时，出现在我们面前的叶采尼已经是管理十八台布机的熟练工人了。我们相互地微笑合十为礼。她告诉我们，她在那次学习开车后，十多天能看一台布机，二十天后看四台，一个半月以后，看八台。到9月底正式生产时，她已经能看十八台了。
    陪同我们参观的中国女工张秀英不止一次地向我们称赞柬埔寨女工的聪明和努力。她说，开始时，一般女工一分钟还接不上三、四个纱头，她那时曾设想把初步要求定为每分钟接十五个纱头。但是两周后，柬埔寨女工就普遍达到一分钟接十八个头了。现有的十二个帮接工的技术水平也可以称得上是熟练工人了。
    我们来到了细纱车间。这里秩序井然，挡车工轻巧地穿行在机器之间，打扫着机器上的飞絮和接着断头；清洁工在一遍又一遍地打扫着地板。我们遇见了哥慕朗，一个活泼的柬埔寨姑娘。我们早就互相认识了。在5月间访问这个车间时，我们看见她手忙脚乱地在学挡车；棉纱好像故意和她开玩笑似的，一个劲地断头，接上这个顾不上那个。而现在，哥慕朗已经成为机器的主人了，她能看一台半机器共六百三十六个纱锭，并且还摸索出了一些经验。例如，她采取了由她自己起名的“宝塔形换纱法”，可以有条不紊地依次更换粗纱，避免需要换的粗纱挤在一起，以致影响接头。哥慕朗告诉我们，她不但自己这样做，还把这种作法介绍给新来的同伴。
    就在这时，陪同我们的另一个中国女工王秀珍指着一位纤小的柬埔寨姑娘向我们介绍：她做中班，下午两点才该上班，可是她在早上七点钟就来做清洁工作了。我们和她交谈起来。原来她们中班在昨天的产量低于早班，她急得睡不着觉。为了赶上早班，她决定先到车间作好清洁工作，使大家工作好做，可以减少断头，提高质量。她告诉我们，她的名字叫索高母，原是中学三年级学生，今年才十七岁。她因为喜欢当技术工人，才决定放弃学习而进了工厂。和她一样自愿当工人的中学生在这个车间里还有几个。
    半年来，在这个工厂里已经培养出六百多名生产工人，包括纺织工、织布工、保全工、电工等。新的工人还在继续被培训出来。她们自豪地在工作着，特别是当她们知道她们的产品受到了广大人民的欢迎，那种高兴更是难以形容的。
    和她们接触中，我们深深地感到她们和中国技术人员之间的那种亲切的友谊，不是用对友谊的一般的理解可以测度的。还在5月间，我们访问这个尚未正式开工的工厂时，她们就像盼星星、盼月亮那样，盼望着中国纺织女工早日到达好教给她们技术。当中国的两位女工到磅湛时，正是馥郁的白兰花盛开的季节。每天下班时，中国女工所穿围腰的口袋都装满了这种香花。这就是柬埔寨女工们悄悄地放在他们口袋里的。中国女工多次表示婉谢，但都不成功。柬埔寨女工说：我们没有什么东西送给你们，只有用这些自己家里生长的鲜花来表示我们对中国的深切感谢。活泼的索高母曾把她的心情告诉我们说，她一遇到学不好技术时，就睡不好觉了。因为她感到要不努力学习，怎么报答中国对柬埔寨的帮助呢？她激动地拉着我们的手说：“愿中柬两国友谊不断向前发展，要像姊妹一样地亲密。”电工工长翁车恩也对我们表示对中国专家的感激心情，他说：“中国专家教会了我们这些开始连接电线都不会的人掌握了复杂的电工技术。这对柬埔寨自己的工业建设太有意义了。”
    告别这个工厂后，我们的心情仍然十分激动，不禁想起周恩来总理在这个工厂开幕式上所讲的话：“只要我们有决心，依靠我们自己勤劳的双手，依靠友好国家的互助合作，我们一定能够一步一步地把我们的国家建设起来，西方国家能够做到的事，我们亚非国家也一定能够做到。”事实不正是这样吗？望着汽车外一望无边的稻田，想起刚才访问过的勤劳而智慧的柬埔寨工人，我们相信一个现代化的柬埔寨国家不久将出现在这块肥沃的土地上。
