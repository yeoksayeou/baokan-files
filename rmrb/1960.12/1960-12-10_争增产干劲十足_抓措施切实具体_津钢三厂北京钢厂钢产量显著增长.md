Competing to Increase Production, Full of Drive; Grasping Measures Practically and Specifically
Steel Production at Tianjin No. 3 Steel Plant and Beijing Steel Plant Increases Significantly

This newspaper reports that the workers of Tianjin No. 3 Steel Plant are seizing the last month of this year, setting off a new high tide of tackling key problems and competing for high production. On the basis of completing the steel production task ahead of schedule last month, the average daily steel production of the entire plant in the first seven days of December increased by 8.6% compared with late November.

The leading cadres of this plant, at the commendation and competition meeting held on November 30, clearly explained the tasks, key points, and measures to all the workers. All the workers are full of energy, everyone is seizing the key points and striving for high production. Recently, this plant received a batch of pig iron with a relatively high sulfur content, which is a key problem in production. All three steelmaking systems in the plant are tackling the difficulties, giving way to convenience, and vying to refine high-sulfur iron. After the third steelmaking system won the task, it immediately convened a meeting of material receivers, batchers, and steelmakers to jointly formulate desulfurization measures such as strengthening raw material management, external desulfurization, and appropriately increasing ash content. On the 1st and 2nd, the three steelmaking teams of Dai Guangyuan, Xiao Xianzhou, and Bai Yucheng produced qualified steel from high-sulfur iron in every furnace, and on the 3rd and 4th, they continuously overfulfilled the plan.

This newspaper reports that the workers of Beijing Steel Plant are adopting specific measures, fiercely tackling key production problems, and striving to produce more steel in the last month of this year. Steel production from the 3rd to 5th increased by 17.14% compared with the average daily production level of last month; the qualified rate of converter steel reached more than 94%.

In order to maintain the furnace body, the converter workshop organized a three-in-one combination of furnace age teams, divided into three shifts to go down to various work sections and production teams to help workers improve operations and better implement operating procedures. Workers in the bricklaying section launched a competition to catch up with each other around improving the quality of bricklaying, which promoted the further improvement of the quality and output of dolomite bricks.

The Party Secretary and the factory director are focusing on transportation work. The workers of the converter workshop opened up a storage area for steel ingots in front of the workshop. Originally, the steel ingots were transported to the ingot warehouse and then loaded onto trains. Now, it has been changed to direct loading from the workshop, reducing repeated transportation.

    争增产干劲十足　抓措施切实具体
    津钢三厂北京钢厂钢产量显著增长
    本报讯　天津第三钢厂职工抓紧今年最后一个月，掀起了攻关高产竞赛新高潮。全厂在提前完成上月产钢任务的基础上，12月头七天钢的平均日产量比11月下旬增长了8.6％。
    这个厂的领导干部在11月30日开的庆功比武会上，向全厂职工讲清了任务、关键、措施。全厂职工干劲十足，人人抢关键，夺高产。最近，这个厂收到一部分含硫比较高的生铁，是生产中的关键问题。全厂三个炼钢系统抢困难，让方便，争着炼高硫铁。第三炼钢系统争得任务以后，立即召开收料员、配料员、炼钢员的会议，共同制订了加强原料管理、炉外脱硫、适当增加灰量等脱硫措施，在1日、2日，戴光元、萧先洲和白玉成三个炼钢小组用高硫铁炼出的钢，炉炉合格，3日、4日连续超额完成计划。
    本报讯　北京钢厂职工采取具体措施，猛攻生产关键，力争在今年最后的一个月生产更多的钢。3至5日的钢产量，比上月平均日产水平提高17.14％；转炉钢合格率达到94％以上。
    为了维护好炉体，转炉车间组织了三结合的炉龄小组，分三班下到各工段、生产小组，帮助工人改进操作，更好地贯彻执行操作规程。打砖工段工人围绕提高打砖质量掀起你追我赶的竞赛，促进了白云石砖质量和产量的进一步提高。
    党委书记和厂长大抓运输工作。转炉车间职工在车间前开辟了存放钢锭地区，原来把钢锭运到钢锭库再装火车，现在改成由车间直接装车，减少了重复运输。（附图片）
