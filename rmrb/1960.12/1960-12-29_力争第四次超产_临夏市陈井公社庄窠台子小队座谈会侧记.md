The Zhuangketaizi Team of the Chenjing Production Team in the Chenjing People's Commune of Linxia City, Gansu Province, which has won awards for three consecutive years of increased production, recently held a special symposium for its members to strive for a fourth year of increased production next year. The participants included representatives of team members from production, daily life, and other aspects, as well as cadres sent to work at the grassroots level.

Holding a symposium is a good way for this team to boost morale and solve specific problems. At this symposium, everyone first analyzed the favorable conditions for striving for increased production next year. These conditions are: First, the plan is good. The team has planned the planting area for next year based on the principle of planting according to local conditions. Which plot to plant potatoes and which plot to plant wheat have all been decided with respect for the opinions of experienced farmers. Broad beans are a high-yield crop here, and it was decided through the symposium to plant more broad beans and potato stubble. Second, the foundation is good. There has been a lot of rain and snow this autumn and winter, and more than 300 mu of land have been finely plowed. The land for wheat has also been fertilized with base fertilizer, and most of the land for potatoes and broad beans has also been transported with manure. Now, efforts are being made to conserve soil moisture. Third, the livestock are well-fed. Fourth, policies are well implemented, and daily life is well arranged. All 44 laborers in the team are strong and energetic, and full of enthusiasm. After these conditions were laid out, the confidence of all the team members in striving for a fourth year of increased production next year was greatly enhanced.

Old farmer Cui Shengren said at the symposium: Whether or not we can produce more grain next year depends on what we have done this year. This year, the production in our team has "two satisfactions": One satisfaction is that the land has been plowed a lot and plowed well. This year, all 318 mu of winter-fallowed land in the team have been plowed, and 80% of it has been plowed two or three times. It is the first time from the older generation to the present that not a single mu of land has been left unplowed for the winter. The second satisfaction is that more fertilizer has been accumulated this year. This year, the team drove the sheep to the mountains early to accumulate fertilizer on the spot and use it on the spot. The land for planting wheat next year has not only been plowed three times, but also has base fertilizer applied. The wheat is rich from the womb, so why should we be afraid that it will not produce more grain? The most important task now is to conserve soil moisture and transport all the manure to the land.

Canteen manager Cui Huaibing said: This year, our Chenjing Production Team has produced more grain than last year. The rations for the team members have been arranged until August next year, the vegetables have also been arranged until the green vegetables are available next year, and the coal for burning has also been stored until June next year. We will definitely plan the use of grain and vegetables according to the busy and slack seasons, and ensure that the team members are satisfied with their meals.

Livestock breeder Yao Zhongxiao said: Livestock are the foundation of agriculture. This winter, our livestock have been well-fed. Now, in addition to drawing a few first-class fat livestock every day to pull the stone roller to tamp the land, the other livestock are all in warm pens, watered twice a day and fed grass four times a night. Now, all 27 livestock are first- and second-class fat, ensuring they are healthy to welcome the spring plowing.

After the symposium, the cadres and team members worked together with one heart and one mind to strive for increased production next year, and strengthened various aspects of work in a down-to-earth manner. Canteen manager Cui Huaibing, in order to arrange the team members' winter life well, and the cooks came up with many ways to increase the variety of meals; livestock breeders Cui Qingzhong and Yao Zhongxiao, in order to feed the livestock well, voluntarily requested to do the work of chopping grass themselves, so as to ensure that the grass is chopped finely. They also add feed to pregnant female animals every day to protect the fetus; the young people responsible for transporting fertilizer, due to thinking of ways and means, greatly increased the amount of manure transported every day.

    力争第四次超产
    临夏市陈井公社庄窠台子小队座谈会侧记
    接连获得三年超产受奖的甘肃临夏市陈井人民公社陈井生产队庄窠台子小队，为力争明年实现第四年超产，最近专门召开了一次社员座谈会。参加座谈的包括生产、生活等方面的社员代表和下放干部。
    召开座谈会，是这个小队鼓干劲和解决具体问题的一种很好的形式。在这次座谈会上，大家首先分析了明年争取超产的有利条件。这些条件是：第一是计划好。这个小队根据因地种植的原则，已计划好明年的种植面积。哪块种洋芋，哪块种小麦，都尊重老农的意见订出来了。蚕豆在这里是高产作物，通过座谈决定多种一些蚕豆和豆茬洋芋。第二是底子好，今年秋冬雨雪下得多，又将三百多亩地全部犁细，种麦的地还施了底粪，种洋芋和蚕豆的地大部分也运上了粪，现在正抓紧打地保墒。第三是牲口喂得好。第四是政策贯彻好，生活安排好，全队四十四个劳力都是精强力壮，干劲十足。这些条件摆出来以后，使全队社员争取明年第四次超产的信心大大增强了。
    老农崔生仁在座谈会上说：明年能不能多打粮食，就要看今年干了些啥活。今年我们小队里的生产有“两称心”：一称心是地犁得多，犁得好。今年全队三百一十八亩冬闲地全部犁过了，有八成还犁了二遍到三遍，从老一辈到现在，不留一亩地过冬还是头一回。二称心是今年肥料积攒得多。今年队里把羊早早赶到山上，就地积，就地用，明年种小麦的地不光犁了三遍，还卧了底粪，小麦胎里富，还怕它不多打粮食？现在最要紧的任务是要把地墒打好保好、把粪都运上地。
    食堂管理员崔怀秉说：今年，我们陈井生产队的粮食比去年打得多，社员的口粮已安排到明年8月，菜也安排到明年接上青菜，烧的煤也贮备到明年6月。我们一定按照季节忙闲，计划用粮用菜，保证社员吃得满意。
    饲养员姚仲孝说：牲口是农业之本，今冬我们的牲口喂得好。现在，除每天抽几头一类膘牲口拉碌碡打地外，其他牲畜都在暖圈里，一天两次水，一夜四道草，现在二十七头牲口都是一、二类膘，保证健壮迎接春耕。
    座谈会后，干部社员一条心一股劲为明年实现超产努力，并且脚踏实地地加强各方面工作。食堂管理员崔怀秉为了把社员过冬生活安排好，和炊事员一起想出许多办法增加饭菜花样；饲养员崔庆忠、姚仲孝为了喂好牲畜，主动要求把铡草的工作交给他们自己去做，这样可以保证把草铡得细，他们每天还给怀孕母畜加喂饲料，保好胎；负责运送肥料的青年们，由于想方设法，每天运粪量大大增加。
