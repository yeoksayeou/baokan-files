Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 19th: The Vietnam News Agency reported today that Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, has written to the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina, requesting them to "take appropriate and urgent measures to ensure that the Geneva Agreements on Laos are complied with, and to create the necessary conditions to restore the power of the current sole legitimate government of Laos – the government of Prince Phouma.”

In the letter, broadcast on the Lao Fighting Units radio station on the 18th, Souphanouvong urged the two chairmen to pay attention to "the extremely serious situation in Laos, which is caused by the armed intervention of the American imperialists and their followers in Thailand, and by their assistance to their servants, the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Nacamboune group, in openly launching a rebellion against the legitimate government of Prince Phouma.”

The letter pointed out that the Phoumi-Boun Oum rebel group, with "the direct reinforcement of Thai army units, South Vietnamese troops, and Chiang Kai-shek remnants, using American-supplied howitzers, tanks, aircraft, and other military equipment, under the direct command of American officers," attacked Vientiane.

The letter emphasized that "it is very clear that the American imperialists are militarily interfering in Laos behind the Phoumi-Boun Oum rebel group. They have mobilized all the necessary forces of the aggressive SEATO bloc, using Thai territory close to Laos as a base for logistics, flight, and espionage activities, using Thai territory and transportation to transport troops, and using Thai bases to coordinate the actions of the Phoumi-Boun Oum rebel forces.”

The letter stated, "This blatant act of aggression is carried out by the American imperialists, with the support of the SEATO countries, especially the reactionary government of Thailand and the reactionary faction of South Vietnam, in blatant disregard of the sovereignty of the Lao people, the Geneva Agreements on Laos, and the basic principles of international law.”

The letter continued, "The crude interference of the American imperialists, the Thai reactionaries, and other servants of American imperialism in Laos has made the situation in Laos increasingly serious and may endanger the peace of Indochina and Southeast Asia.”

The letter stated, "In order to restore the authority of the Geneva Agreements on Laos, and to safeguard the peace of this region, I, on behalf of the Lao Patriotic Front, once again bring to the attention of the two chairmen the extremely serious threat posed to our country by the blatant aggression of the American imperialists and other reactionaries, their lackeys.” The letter concluded by making demands to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference regarding the adoption of emergency measures.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 19th: Quinim Pholsena, representative of the legitimate Phouma government of Laos, issued a statement severely condemning the crimes of the United States, Thailand, and the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group in attacking and destroying Vientiane, and calling on the Lao people to unite and resolutely resist the enemy to defend the fatherland and the policy of peace, neutrality, national harmony, and a unified country.

The statement also called on peace-loving countries and peoples in the world, especially the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, the signatory countries of the Geneva Agreements on Laos, and Asian and African countries, to support the struggle of the legitimate government and people of Laos against the aggression of the United States and Thailand.

The "Voice of Laos" radio station of the legitimate Lao government broadcast the statement on the 18th, and the Lao Fighting Units radio station rebroadcast it today.

The statement said that the attack on the capital Vientiane by the armies of the United States, Thailand, and the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group has resulted in the destruction of our beloved capital, with hundreds of people injured and killed, hundreds of houses destroyed, and historical relics of our nation ruined.

The statement said, "Government troops and police officers, commanders and fighters of the Lao Fighting Units, armed youth forces, and the people of Vientiane, responding to the call of the legitimate Phouma government, have fought heroically against an enemy several times their size, giving them heavy blows. Because they were reinforced by forces and new weapons from Thailand, and bombarded us from Thailand, the government forces withdrew from the city to continue fighting. The military and civilians of Vientiane harbor unparalleled hatred for the American and Thai aggressors and the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous group."

The statement pointed out that the armies of the United States, Thailand, and the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous group, disregarding the Lao people's desire for peace, invaded Vientiane on December 13th and have now occupied the destroyed Vientiane. Currently, they are reinforcing their troops and weapons in an attempt to occupy our entire country.

The statement said, "Faced with the heinous atrocities and national crisis, I, on behalf of the legitimate Phouma government, issue the following statement: American imperialism, the Thai reactionaries, and the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous group must bear full responsibility for the consequences they have caused in Vientiane in the past few days."

The statement warmly praised the heroic fighting spirit of the government's troops, police, Lao Fighting Units, youth, and people of Vientiane.

The statement expressed support for the proposal of the Committee for Peace, Neutrality, National Harmony, and National Unification to designate December 13th as National "Day of Hatred" in order to record the crimes of American imperialism, the Thai reactionaries, and the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous group.

    苏发努冯亲王呼吁日内瓦会议两位主席采取紧急措施
    要求遵守日内瓦协议恢复富马政府权力
    奔舍那指出美国及其走狗应负摧毁万象的全部责任
    新华社河内19日电　据越南通讯社今天报道：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王已经写信给1954年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议两位主席，要求他们“采取适当和紧急措施，来确保关于老挝的日内瓦协议得到遵守，并创造必要的条件，以恢复目前老挝的唯一合法政府——富马亲王政府的权力”。
    苏发努冯在寮国战斗部队电台18日广播的这封信中促请两位主席注意“极端严重的老挝局势，这种局势是美帝国主义者和他们在泰国的追随者进行武装干涉以及他们帮助自己的仆从富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞集团对富马亲王的合法政府公然发动叛乱所造成的”。
    信件指出，富米—文翁叛乱集团在“泰国陆军部队、南越军队和蒋介石残余分子的直接增援下，用美国供给的榴弹炮、坦克、飞机和其他军事装备，在美国军官直接指挥之下”进攻了万象。
    信件强调说，“很显然，美帝国主义者在富米—文翁叛乱集团背后对老挝进行了军事干涉。他们调动了侵略性的东南亚条约组织集团的一切必要的力量，利用靠近老挝的泰国领土作为基地来进行后勤、飞行和间谍活动，利用泰国的领土和运输工具来运输军队，利用泰国的基地来配合富米—文翁叛乱部队的行动。”
    信件说，“这种明目张胆的侵略行动，是美帝国主义者在东南亚条约组织国家、特别是泰国反动政府和南越反动派的支持下，悍然不顾老挝人民的主权、关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议和国际法的基本原则而进行的。”
    信件接着说，“美帝国主义者、泰国反动派和美帝国主义的其他仆从对老挝的粗暴干涉，已使老挝的局势日趋严重，并且可能危害印度支那和东南亚的和平。”
    信件说，“为了恢复关于老挝的日内瓦协议的权力，为了保障这个地区的和平，我代表老挝爱国战线党，再次提请两位主席注意美帝国主义者和其他反动派、他们的走狗的明目张胆的侵略对我国的极其严重的威胁。”信件最后向日内瓦会议两位主席提出了关于采取紧急措施的要求。
    新华社河内19日电　老挝合法的富马政府的代表贵宁·奔舍那发表声明，严厉谴责美国、泰国和富米·诺萨万叛国集团进攻和破坏万象的罪行，并号召老挝全国人民团结一致，坚决抗击敌人以保卫祖国、保卫和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家的政策。
    声明还呼吁世界上爱好和平的国家和人民，首先是日内瓦会议两位主席、关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的签字国和亚非国家，支持老挝合法政府和人民反对美国和泰国侵略老挝的斗争。
    老挝合法政府的“老挝之声”电台18日广播了这项声明，寮国战斗部队电台今天转播了这项声明。
    声明说，美国、泰国和富米·诺萨万叛国集团军队对首都万象的进攻，使得我们的亲爱的首都受到破坏，成百人民遭受伤亡，成百间房子被摧毁，我们民族的历史遗迹也被毁坏。
    声明说，“政府军队和警察官兵、寮国战斗部队指挥员和战斗员、青年武装力量和万象人民响应富马合法政府的号召，对比自己的力量大几倍的敌人进行了英勇的战斗，给予他们沉重的打击。由于他们得到来自泰国的力量和新式武器的增援，并从泰国炮击我们，因此，政府方面的力量撤出城市以继续进行战斗。万象军民对美国和泰国侵略者及富米—文翁叛国集团怀着无比的仇恨。”
    声明指出，美国、泰国和富米—文翁叛国集团的军队不顾老挝人民的和平愿望，在12月13日进犯万象，现在已占领了被摧毁的万象。目前，他们正在增援军队和武器，企图占领我们的整个国土。
    声明说，“面对着令人发指的惨象和民族危机，我代表富马合法政府发表声明如下：美帝国主义、泰国反动派和富米—文翁叛国集团必须对他们几天来在万象所造成的后果担负全部责任。”
    声明热烈赞扬政府的军队、警察，寮国战斗部队，万象青年和人民的英勇战斗精神。
    声明表示赞成争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会的建议，把12月13日作为民族“仇恨日”，以便记下美帝国主义、泰国反动派和富米—文翁叛国集团的罪行。
