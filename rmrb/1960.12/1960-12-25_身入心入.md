	Body and Mind In
	He Hozhi
	Cadres go deep to the bottom,
	Production soars to the sky,
	Body in and mind in too,
	Everyone works with glee!
	These four lines of poetry were written by workers at the Hengyang Dongfeng Machinery Factory in Hunan to praise Li Ningjie, the First Secretary of the Chengnan District Committee of Hengyang. Comrade Li Ningjie went deep into the fitter workshop assembly team of the Dongfeng Machinery Factory, often eating, living, working, and consulting with the workers, grasping the most critical issues in production, and working hard day and night with the workers to research. He also took the lead in organizing and participating in the factory's one-stop large-scale collaboration competition, quickly reversing the passive situation in production and winning unanimous praise from the majority of workers.
	“Body in” and “mind in,” this is true depth. Going deep must be thorough, meaning going to your most basic units. These units are the foundation of our country, society, and enterprise organizations, and the starting and ending points of all tasks. Hundreds of millions of people are producing, living, and struggling within these organizations. "A tall building rises from the ground, rooted in the grassroots." If the work of these units is done well, all work will be easy to handle.
	Going deep is not just about seeing where you go, but more importantly, seeing whether you actively participate in the class struggle and production struggle practices of the masses. At present, it means seeing whether you wholeheartedly devote yourself to the campaign of increasing production and practicing economy centered on grain and steel, and whether you have invested in the front line of production. As the saying goes, "How can you get tiger cubs without entering the tiger's den?" Without going to the grassroots, it is impossible to do a good job in the grassroots. Chairman Mao said, "Whoever wants to know a thing has no way of doing so except by coming into contact with it, that is, by living (practicing) in its environment." (《On Practice》)
	"Body in" is the foundation of going deep, the prerequisite for going deep. Without being present physically, there is naturally no way to talk about going deep. Adhering to the "four togethers" is an important sign of whether one is "body in" or not. Only by achieving the "four togethers" can we be familiar with the production, life, and ideological conditions of the masses, share weal and woe with the masses, be closely related, breathe the same air, share the same destiny, and establish deep feelings with the masses, going deep into the broad masses.
	However, going deep not only requires being present physically, but more importantly, ideological depth, that is, "mind in." Thought is the guide of action. Without "mind in," one cannot carefully synthesize, compare, and study the materials felt, and cannot deeply understand and comprehend the essence of objective things. One cannot better summarize and improve experience from practical work, discover problems and solve them in a timely manner, and use them to guide practice. Chairman Mao also taught us in "On Practice": "To reflect the whole of a thing completely, to reflect its essence, to reflect its internal laws, one must go through the process of thinking, and transform and reconstruct the rich perceptual material by discarding the crude and selecting the refined, discarding the false and retaining the true, proceeding from one to the other, and from the outside to the inside, to create a system of concepts and theories, and one must leap from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge." Therefore, the process from "body in" to "mind in" is actually also the process from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge.
	"Body in" and "mind in" first require a high degree of revolutionary responsibility to serve the masses wholeheartedly. Only in this way can we give our hearts to the masses, be understood by the masses, and the masses will also give their hearts to you, truly being heart-to-heart with the masses, becoming the "confidant" of the masses. In this way, we can act in accordance with the Party's policy instructions, carry the Party's policies to the end, and also promptly reflect the demands of the masses, and effectively solve problems. Being both physically and mentally involved, connecting the top and the bottom, connecting the left and the right, repeated cycles, repeated practice, the work can be done better and achieve greater practical results.

    身入心入
    何鹄志
    干部深到底，
    生产冲上天，
    身入又心入，
    人人干得欢！
    这四句诗，是湖南衡阳东风机械厂工人们写来称赞衡阳城南区委第一书记李宁结的。李宁结同志深入到东风机械厂钳工车间装配组，经常同职工群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，抓住了生产上的最关键问题，和职工群众一道，日夜苦心研究，并带头组织和参加了厂里的一条龙大协作竞赛，很快扭转了生产上的被动局面，获得了广大职工群众同声称赞。
      “身入”又“心入”，这才是真正的深入。深入一定要一深到底，就是到自己最基层的单位去。这些单位是我们国家、社会和企业组织的基础，是各项工作的起点和落脚点。亿万群众就是生产、生活、斗争在这些组织里面。“万丈高楼平地起，生根落脚在基层”。这些单位的工作做得好，一切工作就好办。
    深入不光是看下到什么地方，重要的看是不是积极投身到群众的阶级斗争和生产斗争的实践中去。在当前就是看是否满腔热情地亲身投入到以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动中去，是否投入到生产第一线去。常言道：“不入虎穴，焉得虎子”。不入基层，是无法做好基层工作的。毛主席说过“无论何人要认识什么事物，除了同那个事物接触，即生活于（实践于）那个事物的环境中，是没有法子解决的。”
  （《实践论》）身入是深入的基础，是深入的前提，没有身入，当然谈不上深入。坚持“四同”，是“身入”与否的重要标志。只有做到“四同”，才能熟悉群众的生产、生活和思想情况，才能和群众同甘共苦，休戚相关，同呼吸，共命运，才能和群众建立深厚的感情，深入到广大群众中去。
    然而，深入不仅要身入，更重要的是思想上的深入，也就是要“心入”。思想是行动的先导，如果没有心入，就不能把感觉到的材料，细心地加以综合、比较、研究，就无法深刻地认识和理解客观事物的本质，就不能更好地从实际工作中总结提高经验，及时发现问题解决问题，用来指导实践。毛主席在《实践论》中还教导我们：“要完全地反映整个的事物，反映事物的本质，反映事物的内部规律性，就必须经过思考作用，将丰富的感觉材料加以去粗取精、去伪存真、由此及彼、由表及里的改造制作工夫，造成概念和理论的系统，就必须从感性认识跃进到理性认识。”所以，从身入到心入的过程，实际也是由感性认识到理性认识的过程。
    “身入”“心入”首先是要有一心一意为群众服务的高度革命责任感。只有这样，才能把自己的心交给群众，为群众所了解，群众也会把心交给你，和群众真正心心相印，成为群众的“知心人”。这样，我们才能根据党的政策指示办事，把党的政策一通到底，从而也把群众的要求及时反映上来，切实解决问题。既身入又心入，通上通下，通左通右，反复循环，反复实践，工作也就能做得更好，取得更大的实效了。
