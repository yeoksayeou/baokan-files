Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, December 7th. The Bulgarian newspaper *Rabotnichesko Delo* published an editorial on December 7th entitled "New Victories for the Cause of Peace and Communism," commenting on the declaration of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries.

The editorial said that this declaration, like the declaration adopted in 1957 and the Peace Manifesto, "is the fighting banner and sharp weapon of Communists and all working people in the struggle for peace, national independence, democracy and socialism." This declaration "once again proves the unshakable unity and maturity of the international communist and workers' movement, and it is a new victory for Marxism-Leninism."

The editorial pointed out that we live in a historically significant era. The main content of our time is the transition from capitalism to socialism that began with the Great October Socialist Revolution. Socialism has become a world system. Now, without socialist countries, no world problem can be properly resolved.

The editorial said, "In contrast to the continuous upsurge of the world socialist system is the decline and disintegration of capitalism. The contradictions of the capitalist world are becoming increasingly acute, and its general crisis has developed to a new stage. As the declaration points out, attempts to prop up the decaying foundations of capitalism with militarism have further intensified these contradictions."

The editorial said that the facts of capitalist development convincingly refute bourgeois propaganda about the "popular nature" of modern capitalism and the myth of building so-called "welfare states." The decadence of capitalism is vividly manifested in the main capitalist country—the United States. The United States is a country with a deformed militarized economy, and this country extracts wealth from many countries, especially Asian and Latin American countries. "American imperialism insists on dictating to many countries, using group politics and so-called economic 'aid' policies for this purpose. It has become the biggest international exploiter, the main fortress of world reactionary forces, the international gendarme, and the enemy of people all over the world."

The editorial said that a large-scale battle is unfolding between the forces of labor and the forces of capital, between the forces of democracy and the forces of reaction, and between the forces of freedom and the forces of colonialism. The power to strike and defeat imperialism is growing.

The editorial then talked about the achievements and victories of the world socialist system, the main product of the international working class. It said, "The victory of the Soviet Union, which first opened the road to communism, is of world historical significance."

The editorial said that the socialist countries have achieved these historically significant victories because of the correct leadership of their Marxist-Leninist parties, the great economic, technical and scientific assistance given to them by the Soviet Union, the friendship and cooperation between them, and the unlimited possibilities provided by the socialist social system.

When discussing the issue of war and peace, the editorial pointed out, "War is a constant companion of capitalism. As long as imperialism exists, there will be soil for aggressive war. The main force of aggression and war is American imperialism. With the participation of British, French and West German imperialists, American imperialism has dragged many countries into military-political aggressive blocs to oppose the socialist camp."

The editorial said, "The aggressive nature of imperialism has not changed. However, the world has undergone profound and revolutionary changes. A force has formed that can crush the aggressive plans of the imperialists." "Now, the struggle for peace is an important task for Communist and Workers' Parties. History has entrusted the Communists with the great mission of saving mankind from the catastrophe of thermonuclear war."

The editorial said, "Peace-loving forces should fight against the danger of a new war, and not wait until atomic and hydrogen bombs fall."

The editorial said that the assessment of the complete collapse of colonialism, and the prospects revealed for the development of newly liberated countries and the victorious completion of their just struggles, are of great significance for the wider development of the national liberation struggle. The historical significance of the collapse of the colonial system is second only to the formation of the socialist system.

The editorial said that the international communist and workers' movement faces new and great tasks. The highest requirement for all Communist Parties and their internationalist duty is to "strengthen their unity on the unshakable principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, strengthen the unity of the entire international communist and workers' movement, and continue to wage a resolute struggle on two fronts—against revisionism, which remains the main danger, and also against dogmatism and sectarianism." The editorial said, "The declaration emphasizes that unity makes the strength of our movement multiply and provides a reliable guarantee for the victorious advance of the great communist cause and the smooth repelling of enemy attacks."

"The Moscow meeting and the documents it adopted are another manifestation of the firm unity and unshakable solidarity of Marxist-Leninist parties."

The editorial said that the imperialists and their thinkers and propagandists have repeatedly predicted the division of the ranks of the international communist movement. These predictions, as at any time before, have been completely bankrupt.

The editorial concluded by saying that the Bulgarian Communist Party and the people of our country are very satisfied with the results of this meeting. They fully endorse the analysis and evaluation made in the declaration.

    和平和共产主义事业的新胜利
    保加利亚《工人事业报》12月7日社论摘要
    新华社索非亚7日电　保加利亚《工人事业报》7日以“和平和共产主义事业的新胜利”为题发表社论，评各国共产党和工人党代表会议的声明。
    社论说，这一声明同1957年通过的宣言和和平宣言一样，“是共产党人和全体劳动人民争取和平、民族独立、民主和社会主义的战斗旗帜和锐利的武器。”这个声明“又一次证明了国际共产主义运动和工人运动的不可动摇的团结一致和它的成熟性，它是马克思列宁主义新的胜利。”
    社论指出，我们生活在具有历史意义的时代。我们时代的主要内容是伟大的十月社会主义革命所开始的从资本主义向社会主义的过渡。社会主义已经成为世界体系。现在，没有社会主义国家，任何世界问题都不能得到妥善的解决。
    社论说，“同世界社会主义体系的不断高涨相对照的是资本主义的衰落和瓦解。资本主义世界的矛盾日益尖锐，它的总危机已发展到了一个新的阶段。正如声明中指出的那样，用军国主义来支撑资本主义的腐朽基础的企图使这些矛盾更加紧张起来。”
    社论说，资本主义发展的事实令人信服地驳倒了资产阶级宣传关于现代资本主义的“人民性”、关于建立所谓“福利国家”的神话。资本主义的腐朽性在现代资本主义的主要国家——美国鲜明地表现了出来。美国是畸形的军事化经济的国家，这个国家榨取许多国家的、特别是亚洲和拉丁美洲国家的财富。“美国帝国主义硬要对许多国家发号施令，为此而利用集团政策和所谓经济‘援助’政策。它成了最大的国际剥削者、成了世界反动势力的主要堡垒，成了国际宪兵和全世界人民的敌人。”
    社论说，劳动力量和资本力量之间，民主力量和反动力量之间，自由力量和殖民主义力量之间，正在展开一场大规模的会战。能够打击并战胜帝国主义的力量正在成长。
    社论接着谈到国际工人阶级的主要产物——世界社会主义体系的成就和胜利。它说，“第一个开辟着通向共产主义道路的苏联的胜利是具有世界历史意义的。”
    社论说，社会主义国家取得这些具有历史意义的胜利，是由于自己的马克思列宁主义的政党的正确领导，由于苏联给予它们的巨大的经济、技术和科学援助，由于它们之间的友谊和合作，由于社会主义的社会制度所提供的无限的可能性。
    社论在谈到战争与和平的问题时指出，“战争是资本主义的经常伴侣。只要帝国主义还存在，就有侵略战争的土壤。侵略和战争的主要力量是美国帝国主义。在英、法和西德的帝国主义者的参与下，美国帝国主义把许多国家拉入军事政治侵略集团，来反对社会主义阵营。”
    社论说，“帝国主义的侵略本性没有改变。但是，世界已经发生了深刻的、革命性的变化。形成了能够粉碎帝国主义者的侵略计划的力量。”“现在，争取和平的斗争，是共产党和工人党的重要任务。历史交给了共产党人拯救人类免遭热核战争浩劫的伟大使命。”
    社论说，“爱好和平的力量应当为反对新战争的危险而斗争，而不要等到落原子弹和氢弹的时候。”
    社论说，关于殖民主义完全崩溃的估计，以及所揭示出的不久前获得解放的国家发展和胜利完成它们的正义斗争的前景，对于民族解放斗争更广泛的开展具有很大意义。殖民主义体系瓦解的历史意义仅次于社会主义体系形成。
    社论说，国际共产主义运动和工人运动面临着新的巨大的任务。对各共产党的最高要求和它们的国际主义职责就是要在“不可动摇的马克思列宁主义原则和无产阶级国际主义原则上加强自己的团结一致，加强整个国际共产主义运动和工人运动的团结一致，继续在两条战线上进行坚决斗争——反对仍然是主要危险的修正主义，也反对教条主义和宗派主义”。社论说，“声明中强调指出，一致和团结，使我们运动的力量成倍地增长，并且为伟大共产主义事业的胜利前进和顺利击退敌人的进攻提供可靠的保证。”
    “莫斯科会议和它所通过的文件是马克思列宁主义政党坚强一致和不可动摇的团结的又一表现。”
    社论说，帝国主义者和它们的思想家与宣传家都一再预言国际共产主义运动队伍的分裂。这些预言同在此以前的任何时候一样，都已经完全破产了。
    社论最后说，保加利亚共产党和我国人民对于这次会议的工作成果感到十分满意。他们完全拥护声明中所作的分析和评价。
