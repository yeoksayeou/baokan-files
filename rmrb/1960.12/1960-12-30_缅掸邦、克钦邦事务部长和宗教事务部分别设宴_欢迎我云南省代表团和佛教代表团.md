Tonight, the Department of Religious Affairs of the Union of Burma hosted a banquet to entertain the Chinese Buddhist Delegation led by Master Xiraojiacuo, President of the Buddhist Association of China. U Thein Maung, President of the Union of Burma Buddhist Association and retired Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who presided over the banquet on behalf of U Ba Swe, Minister of Religious Affairs of the Union of Burma, pointed out in his speech at the banquet that the religious relations between China and Burma have developed in recent years, and the political, economic, and cultural relations between the two countries have also developed on the basis of friendship and harmony.

He said that the visit of Master Xiraojiacuo and the Chinese Buddhist Delegation he led to Burma will greatly enhance and consolidate the friendship between the two countries.

U Thein Maung wished Master Xiraojiacuo and the members of the Chinese Buddhist Delegation good health and happiness, and he also wished the friendship between China and Burma would last forever.

Master Xiraojiacuo said in his reply: "We are particularly pleased to be able to visit your country at the time when the Burmese people are celebrating the grand Burmese Independence Day and when our Premier Zhou Enlai is visiting your country and the two governments are about to exchange the instruments of ratification of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty. In our Chinese words, this can be said to be 'double happiness.'"

Master Xiraojiacuo said, "The signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty and the exchange of instruments of ratification are not only a joyous event for the people of our two countries, but also a joyous event for the people of Asia and the world."

He said: "Now, we have a peaceful and friendly boundary treaty. This means that there is a broad and brilliant 'golden and silver avenue' between the people of our two countries. Like the more than two thousand kilometers of mountains and rivers that stretch along the border, the people of our two countries will be more united, heart to heart and hand in hand."

On behalf of Chinese Buddhists, Master Xiraojiacuo extended warm congratulations and best wishes to Burmese Buddhist co-religionists and the Burmese people.

Among those present at tonight's banquet were Sao Kun Kyi, Speaker of the Nationalities Chamber of Burma and Executive Committee Member of the Union Buddhist Association, U Khin Tun, Judge of the Supreme Court and Vice President of the Union Buddhist Association, and other Buddhist figures and senior Burmese officials. Lei Yang and Sun Shengwei, Counselors of the Chinese Embassy in Burma, also attended the banquet.
