    His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Head of State of Cambodia, was born on October 31, 1922. He is the son of His Majesty King Norodom Suramarit of Cambodia, who passed away on April 3, 1960, and Her Majesty Queen Kossamak Nearireath.
    On April 23, 1941, the Prince was nominated to succeed his maternal grandfather, King Sisowath Monivong, to the throne (Cambodia's monarchy is elective), and was crowned on October 28 of the same year.
    On January 7, 1946, France recognized Cambodia's internal autonomy, and on November 8, 1949, France recognized Cambodia's independence. However, this "legal" independence did not become a reality because France retained the most important powers, especially in military, diplomatic, police and judicial affairs. Through lengthy consultations, His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk was able to restore some sovereignty, and on June 15, 1952, launched a movement to reclaim the powers still held by France within the Kingdom. France was forced to transfer its last powers to the Royal Government on November 9, 1953.
    On March 3, 1955, His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk abdicated. Subsequently, he formed the People's Socialist Community. This alliance won 82% of the vote in the September 11, 1955 election and won all the seats in the National Assembly.
    On October 3, 1955, Prince Norodom Sihanouk became the head of the Royal Government, amended the constitution, established a National Congress that met every six months, organized people's assemblies in various provinces, and launched a people's movement to develop education.
    In April 1955, Prince Norodom Sihanouk attended the Bandung Asian-African Conference and announced that Cambodia agreed to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
    From 1956 to 1960, Prince Norodom Sihanouk visited Japan, the Philippines, China, Poland, Spain, Austria, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Indonesia, the United Arab Republic, India, Burma, the United States, and Mongolia.
    Prince Norodom Sihanouk has devoted himself to freeing Cambodia from its underdeveloped state. After the implementation of the first two-year economic plan in 1957-1958, he put forward the 1960-1964 five-year plan named after him. The main goal of this plan is to increase production. The Prince also launched a movement to participate in physical labor, setting an example by participating in productive labor himself, working as an earthmover for several weeks each year on large construction sites such as dams, highways, and railways.
    After the death of His Majesty King Norodom Suramarit, the people unanimously hoped that the Prince would ascend the throne again. Faithful to the oath he made in 1955, the Prince refused. However, he agreed to perform the duties of Head of State of Cambodia during the entire period without a king.
    Prince Norodom Sihanouk has always advocated the development of friendly and cooperative relations with China, and has always supported the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations. In February 1956, he personally led the National Delegation of the Kingdom of Cambodia on its first visit to China, and issued a joint statement with Premier Zhou Enlai, confirming the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as the firm and unwavering guiding principle for relations between the two countries, laying a solid foundation for the development of friendly relations between the two countries. In July 1958, at the initiative of Prince Sihanouk, the governments of China and Cambodia established normal diplomatic relations. Subsequently, the National Delegation of the Kingdom of Cambodia, led by Prince Sihanouk himself, paid a second visit to our country, further promoting economic and cultural ties between the two countries. When Premier Zhou Enlai visited the Kingdom of Cambodia twice in November 1956 and May 1960, he was warmly received by the government and people of the Kingdom of Cambodia, headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. These mutual visits between the leaders of the two countries have greatly promoted the tremendous development of the close-knit friendly relations between the two countries. His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk's visit to our country this time is his first state visit to our country since he assumed the post of Head of State.

    诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王传略
    柬埔寨国家元首诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王殿下生于1922年10月31日。他是1960年4月3日逝世的柬埔寨国王诺罗敦·苏拉马里特陛下和哥沙曼·尼亚里丽王后陛下之子。
    1941年4月23日亲王被提名继承外祖父西梳瓦·莫尼旺国王的王位（柬埔寨的君主政体是选举的），同年10月28日加冕。
    1946年1月7日，法国承认柬埔寨的内部自治，1949年11月8日法国又承认柬埔寨独立。但是这种“法律”上的独立并没有变成事实，因为法国保留了最主要的权力，特别是在军事、外交、警察和司法方面。诺罗敦·西哈努克陛下通过长期协商，使一部分主权得以恢复，又在1952年6月15日展开了一个收回法国在王国内还握有的权力的运动。法国被迫在1953年11月9日将它握有的最后的一些权力移交给王国政府。
    1955年3月3日诺罗敦·西哈努克陛下退位。接着，他组成了人民社会同盟。这个同盟在1955年9月11日的选举中得票82％，并且赢得了国民议会中的全部席位。
    1955年10月3日，诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王任王国政府首脑，修改了宪法，成立了一个每半年召开会议一次的全国代表大会，组织了各省人民议会，发动人民运动以发展教育。
    1955年4月，诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王参加万隆亚非会议，宣布柬埔寨同意和平共处五项原则。
    1956年至1960年诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王曾访问过日本、菲律宾、中国、波兰、西班牙、奥地利、捷克斯洛伐克、苏联、南斯拉夫、印度尼西亚、阿联、印度、缅甸、美国和蒙古等国。
    诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王曾致力于使柬埔寨摆脱不发达的状态。1957—1958年执行了第一个两年经济计划以后，他提出了以他的名字命名的1960—1964年的五年计划。这个计划的主要目标是增加生产。亲王还发起了一个参加体力劳动的运动，他自己以身作则，参加生产劳动，每年有好几个星期在水坝、公路和铁路等大型建筑工地上当土方工人。
    诺罗敦·苏拉马里特国王陛下逝世以后，人民一致希望亲王再度登基。亲王忠于自己在1955年所作的誓言，表示拒绝。但同意在没有国王的整个期间执行柬埔寨国家元首的职务。
    诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王一贯主张同中国发展友好合作关系，并且一贯支持中国在联合国的合法权利的恢复。1956年2月他亲自率领柬埔寨王国国家代表团第一次访问中国，同周恩来总理共同发表联合声明，确认以和平共处五项原则作为指导两国关系的坚定不移的方针，为两国友好关系的发展奠定了稳固的基础。1958年7月，在西哈努克亲王倡议下，中柬两国政府建立了正常的外交关系。随后由西哈努克亲王亲自率领的柬埔寨王国国家代表团第二次访问了我国，进一步促进了两国经济和文化联系。周恩来总理在1956年11月和1960年5月两次访问柬埔寨王国的时候，都受到了以诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王为首的柬埔寨王国政府和人民的隆重接待和热情欢迎。两国领导人的这些相互访问极大地促进了两国亲戚般的友好关系的巨大发展。诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王殿下此次访问我国是他担任国家元首后来我国的第一次国事访问。
