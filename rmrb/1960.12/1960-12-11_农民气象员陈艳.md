    Farmer Meteorologist Chen Yan
    Xu Jiachen
    On the evening of October 29th this year, the granary of the Houshi People's Commune in Dongfeng County, Jilin Province, was a hive of activity. The director of the commune's granary put down the phone and hurriedly said to the two grain management team leaders:
    "Chen Yan from the weather station just called: she said there will be rain and snow after midnight. Quickly cover the grain that's drying, to prevent it from getting moldy from the rain and snow!"
    One of the team leaders turned around and looked outside: the western sky was red, there wasn't even a wisp of cloud in the sky. He said, "Is it really necessary?"
    The deputy team leader said, "Our weather station is not what it was when it was first established!" He looked at the more than 1,000 tons of grain piled up and added, "We can't be careless!"
    With that, the two team leaders led the workers to carry straw mats and cover the grain. They kept busy until after eleven o'clock at night, covering the grain sent from more than twenty management areas. At this point, the team leader looked up and saw that it was still clear, and laughed:
    "The weather hasn't changed, we've worked for nothing."
    The deputy team leader said: "If there was no snow, Chen Yan wouldn’t be so anxious, she even rode her bike over to tell us again!"
    He had barely finished speaking when someone shouted: "The clouds are coming!" After midnight, it really started to rain, first rain, then snow! But more than 1,000 tons of grain were not touched by the rain and snow. The team leaders and workers couldn't help but happily discuss:
    "In the past, they all said that the weather was dictated by the heavens, and only gods could know..."
    "Who's a god! I think people are gods, and living gods at that!"
    Two years ago, Chen Yan was a young farmer who had never even heard the word "meteorology." After the establishment of the People's Commune, the commune Party committee sent him to a meteorologist training class in Dongfeng County for a week of study. After returning, following the instructions of the Party committee, he made do with whatever was available, building a sorghum stalk fence for a wall, finding a wooden pole for a flagpole, and making some instruments using local methods. He established the first meteorological observation field. This saved more than 1,100 yuan compared to using foreign methods. At that time, the newly established Houshi People's Commune did not yet have a broadcasting station. When Xiao Chen made his first weather forecast, his heart was pounding. He sent it to the Party committee for review, and then, without much confidence, called each management area to say:
    "Tomorrow, December 17th, the weather will be sunny, sometimes cloudy..."
    Who knew that the next day, while he was working on the reservoir, wind and snow started falling. The rain and snow beat against his face, and he lowered his head, not daring to look at anyone.
    When he got home for dinner, his father, Chen Dianfu, said impatiently:
    "Well, your forecast of 'sunny, sometimes cloudy' wasn't accurate at all!"
    Chen Yan's face quickly turned red, and after a long while, he said, "It can't always be like this!" The old man sighed, as if remembering something, and said, "Ah! I see all six years of your schooling went to waste!..."
    It turned out that in 1955, just after Chen Yan graduated from elementary school, his father had told him to go to the city to find work. But Chen Yan refused to go, because he had heard his teacher say at school: the countryside is a good place to train young people. Besides, in the countryside, just like in the city, it's all for building socialism! Chen Yan saw that his father was bringing up the matter again, and said decisively:
    "Dad! Put that thought out of your head! I won't leave the countryside, no matter what!"
    That night, Chen Yan tossed and turned, unable to sleep. He thought: What's wrong with the work I'm doing? If the weather station wasn't really useful, how could the secretary have personally helped choose the site for the observation field? It's all my fault for not making an accurate forecast! I must try my best to master this science.
    The next morning, he went to the commune Party committee office. A leading comrade said with a smile: "Don't be discouraged, Xiao Chen! Everything can be solved by relying on the masses. In addition to using foreign methods of observation, why don't you seek out the old farmers and learn some of their experience in observing the sky?"
    Xiao Chen's mind immediately cleared. He took his notebook and went to learn from the old farmers. Chen Yan heard many old people say that the weather here is unpredictable, especially in June and July. Sometimes the ground is so dry it's steaming; sometimes you think it's going to be sunny, but then suddenly there's a thunderstorm, and floods destroy the farmland.
    One day, Chen Yan went to consult the poor peasant, Grandpa Na Fengshan. The old man squinted his eyes and looked out the window. In the distance, Lao Mountain was blue, and next to it was Binglazi Mountain, with snow that never melted in the shady areas. The old man said, "Look, you can tell it's going to rain two or three days beforehand. The mountains all around are misty and whiteish, and some of the valleys are humming. Haven't you heard people say: 'When Gao'er Lao Mountain's clouds hum, it will be flooded in two days'..."
    Chen Yan opened his notebook and quickly wrote down the old man's words.
    In this way, he visited old farmers time and time again, asking them for advice. Before long, he had collected more than two hundred proverbs from the old farmers, such as "Swallows fly high, snakes cross the road," "The jar wears a skirt, the mountain wears a hat" ... filling half a notebook with dense writing. He repeatedly used the facts of weather changes to verify those proverbs, keeping the ones that seemed to make sense and crossing out the unreliable ones. In this way, he selected sixty proverbs from the two hundred or so as a reference for weather forecasting. At the same time, regardless of wind or rain, he went to the weather station three times a day to make observations. In the remaining time, in addition to working in the fields, he also seized the time to study and self-study, sometimes until late at night....

    One day, the secretary of the commune Party committee came to the small weather station office. As soon as he entered, he saw cotton balls, paper balls, and eggplant leaves hanging on the wall, wet and freshly soaked in salt water. On the windowsill, in addition to the original bottle for holding loach, there was a new bottle containing newly caught leeches. On the table, next to the radio and the meteorological observation record book, were some new books, including "On Contradiction," "Meteorology," and others. The Party committee secretary asked him:
    "Xiao Chen, what are you doing with all this stuff?"
    Chen Yan said with a smile: "Loach jumping out of the water often means it will rain the next day. Before making a weather forecast, looking at these things more and analyzing them carefully will help me forecast more accurately!"
    The secretary encouraged him: "Good, if you do it this way, our weather forecasting work will become more and more accurate."
    The weather station has been established for almost two years. In those two years, although the time is not very long, from the Party committee secretary to the commune members, everyone in the Houshi Commune clearly remembers the huge contribution of the commune weather station to agricultural production. Even Chen Yan's father no longer mentioned asking him to go to the city to find work. As the commune Party committee secretary said, the weather forecasting work of Houshi Commune is becoming more and more accurate. For example, last spring, the county weather station had just forecast that the river water in the county would thaw on March 18th, Chen Yan then forecast that the Houshi Commune area might thaw earlier on March 12th. After receiving the forecast, the commune Party committee immediately made arrangements and seized the time to deliver manure. As a result, on the 12th, the Dasha River really thawed. Because of the advance preparations, the manure of many production teams was delivered to the fields before the thawing, and the crops grew particularly well that year!
    On the evening of July 9th this year, Chen Yan listened to the county weather station's weather forecast, which said: "Tonight to tomorrow daytime sunny turning cloudy." This time, he wrote on the commune's forecast sheet: "Tonight sunny, tomorrow moderate to heavy rain..." After this young man finished writing, he thought of the commune's five reservoirs. If they were not reinforced before the heavy rain, more than two hundred hectares of crops below would all suffer from flooding! He took the forecast sheet and hurried to the commune Party committee to report. Someone asked him: "Is it really going to rain?" "Are you sure?" He said "I am sure!" Because before making this forecast, he had carefully studied various observation data, referred to the weather forecasts from Shenyang, Changchun, Siping and the county, and also visited the old farmer Na Fengshan, saw the loach jumping out of the water, and called the weather outposts in several management areas near Gao'er Lao Mountain, who all said they heard the clouds humming. After receiving the forecast, the secretary and members of the commune Party committee immediately divided up the work and led the masses to rush to repair the five reservoirs. Just after the dams and spillways were repaired, rain drops the size of soybeans began to fall "哗哗", and continued for more than two hours. But because the commune had made preparations in advance, the five reservoirs safely weathered the flood season.

    农民气象员陈艳
    徐佳辰
    今年10月29号晚间，吉林省东丰县猴石人民公社粮库里，一片繁忙。公社粮库主任放下电话，急忙对两个管粮食的组长说：
    “刚才气象站陈艳来电话：告诉咱半夜零点以后有雨和雪。快把晾的粮食盖起来，别让雨雪霉烂了！”
    组长转身跑到外边一看：西天一片红，天上连个云彩渣也没有，就说：“不要紧吧？”
    副组长说：“如今咱们的气象站，可不比刚成立的时候了！”他看了看堆积着的一千多吨粮食，又说：“可不能麻痹呀！”
    说着，两个组长就领着工人搬草帘子，盖粮食。一直忙到半夜十一点多钟，才把二十多个管理区送来的粮食盖好。这时候，组长一看，还是晴天，笑道：
    “天没有下呀，白忙了。”
    副组长说：“若是没雪，陈艳哪能那么急，刚才又骑车子跑来告诉一遍！”
    刚说完不大一会儿，就听有人喊：“云彩上来了！”午夜零点以后，真下起雨来，先下的是雨，后来就纷纷地下起雪来！但是，一千多吨粮食一点没让雨雪淋着。组长和工人们禁不住笑嘻嘻地议论：
    “从前都说天老爷刮风下雨，神仙才能知道……”
      “谁是神仙哪！我看人就是神仙，而且是活神仙！”
    两年前，陈艳还是一个连气象二字也没听说过的青年农民。人民公社成立了，公社党委保送他到东丰县气象员训练班去学习了一个星期。回来以后，他就按照党委的指示，因陋就简，自己动手，架起秫秸障子做围墙，找根木头做旗杆，用土办法做了一些仪器，就办起了第一个气象观测场。比用洋法来办，节省了一千一百多元。那时候，刚刚成立的猴石人民公社，还没有广播站，小陈头一次把天气预报单作好，心里卜通卜通直跳，送给党委看完，满没把握地分别向各个管理区打电话说：
    “明天，12月17号，天气晴，有时多云……”
    谁知第二天他正在水库上劳动的时候，天连风带雪下起来，雨雪吹打在他的脸上，他低着头谁也不敢看。
    回到家吃饭的时候，爸爸陈殿福有点不耐烦地说：
    “好啊，天气晴，有时多云不准确啊！”
    陈艳的脸很快红了，老半天才说：“也不能总这样啊！”老人长出了一口气，好像又想起了什么似的说：“咳！叫你读了六年书，我看是白读了！……”
    原来在1955年陈艳高小刚毕业的时候，他爹就让他到城里去找个活干。可是陈艳怎么也不去，因为他在学校就听老师讲过：农村是锻炼青年的好地方。再说，在农村也和在城里一样，都是为了建设社会主义呀！……陈艳看爸爸又提起了那件事，就斩钉截铁地说：
    “爹！你死了那条心吧！让我离开农村，怎么也不行！”
    那天晚上，陈艳翻来复去地睡不着，暗想：我干这活有什么不好呢？气象站若真没有用，书记怎能亲自帮助选观测场的场址呢？都怪我预报没报准！一定要好好争口气，把这门科学掌握住。
    第二天一早，他就到了公社党委办公室。一位领导同志笑着说：“可不能灰心哪，小陈！什么事情依靠群众就有办法。你除了用洋办法观测以外，是不是再找找老农从他们那里找些观天象的经验？”
    小陈心里一下子透了亮。他就夹着本子拜老农为师去了。陈艳听许多老人说，这里的天气变化无常，特别是在6、7月，有时候地里干得直冒烟；有时候眼瞅着是晴天，谁知道转眼就雷雨交加，大水冲毁了庄田。
    一天，陈艳找贫农那凤山老大爷请教。那老大爷眯缝着眼睛望着窗外，只见远处的涝山蓝蓝的，它的旁边，是冰磖子山，山上背阴地方积雪终年不消。老人说：“你瞅，要下雨呀，头两三天就能看出来，四外的山哪，雾气糟糟的，有些发白，有的山谷还嗡嗡直响，你没听人讲吗：高而涝山云雾响，不出两天水汪汪……”
    陈艳打开小本子，赶紧把老人的话记下来。
    就这样他一次一次地去访问老农，向老农请教。不久，他在老农中间就搜集到了二百多条谚语，什么“燕子钻天蛇过道”“缸穿裙子山戴帽”……密密麻麻地记了半个本子。他反复用天气变化的事实，来对证那些谚语，说得有些道理的就留下；不可靠的他就勾掉。这样，他从二百来条谚语里选出了六十条作为气象预报的参考。同时，他不管刮风下雨，每天三次，准时到气象站去观测，剩下的时间，除了下地干活以外，还抓紧读书自修，有时候一直读到深夜……。
    有一天，公社党委书记到小小的气象站办公室里来，一进门，就看墙上新挂了一个个棉花团、纸团、茄叶，湿漉漉的刚被盐水浸过；窗台上，除了原有的装泥鳅的瓶子以外，还增加了一个新瓶，里边装着新捉来的蚂蝗；桌子上，在收音机和气象观测记录簿旁边，还摆了一些新书，有“矛盾论”，“气象学”等，党委书记问他：
    “小陈，你摆这些东西干啥呀？”
    陈艳笑着说：“泥鳅跳出水面，第二天常常有雨，天气预报以前，多看看这些，分析的细致点，报得就能更准一点！”
    书记鼓励他说：“好哇，这样干，咱们的气象预报工作就能愈报愈准确。”
    气象站成立快两年了，两年，时间不算很长，在猴石公社，从党委书记到社员，都很清楚地记得公社气象站对农业生产的巨大贡献。连陈艳的父亲也不再提叫他到城里去找活干了。事实正像公社党委书记说的一样，猴石公社的气象预报工作，就是愈来愈准确了。如去年春天县气象站刚报过3月18日全县河水解冻，陈艳接着预报说，猴石公社地区可能提前在3月12号解冻。公社党委接到预报以后，马上布置，抓紧送粪。结果，到了12号，大沙河果真解冻了。由于事先抓的紧，许多生产队的粪肥，都在解冻前送到了地里，那年的庄稼长得特别好！
    今年7月9号的晚上，陈艳收听县气象站的天气预报说：“今天夜间到明天白天晴转多云”，他这次在公社的预报单上写的是：“今天夜间晴，明天有中到大雨……”这小伙子写完之后，想起公社的五个水库，若不在暴雨前抓紧补修完，下边二百多公顷的庄稼就要全部受到水灾！他拿着预报单急忙跑到公社党委来汇报，有人问他：“真有雨？”“你说的有把握吗？”他说“有把握！”因为他作这次预报以前，仔细研究了各种观察资料，参考了沈阳、长春、四平和县里的气象预报，又访问了老农那凤山，看泥鳅跳出了水面，又给高而涝山跟前的几个管理区气象哨打了电话，他们都说听见了云雾响。公社党委接到预报以后，书记和委员，马上分兵把口，带领群众抢修五个水库，刚把堤坝和溢洪道修好，豆粒大的雨点就“哗哗”地下起来，一直下了两个多小时。但由于公社事先做好了准备，五个水库安全地度过了汛期。
