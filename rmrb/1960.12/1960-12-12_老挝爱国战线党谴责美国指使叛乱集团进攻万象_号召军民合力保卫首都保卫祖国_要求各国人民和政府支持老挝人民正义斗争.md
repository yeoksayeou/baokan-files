Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 10th -- According to a broadcast tonight by the radio station of the Lao Fighting Forces, a spokesperson for the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party issued a statement strongly condemning the acts of gross interference and aggression by U.S. imperialism and Thai reactionaries in Laos.

The statement pointed out that in order to realize its plot to attack Vientiane, subvert the legitimate government of the Kingdom of Laos, and establish a reactionary puppet government in Laos, U.S. imperialism is stepping up the mobilization of all reactionary forces of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization military group, primarily the Thai reactionaries, to engage in even more insidious and frequent collusion with the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group in Laos.

The statement listed a large number of facts to prove that U.S. imperialism and the Thai reactionaries are the masterminds behind the attack on Vientiane by the Lao traitorous group. The statement said that they provide the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group with weapons and ammunition and provide assistance in all aspects. The Thai reactionary group is also using Thai territory as a springboard for the Phoumi Nosavan rebels to attack Vientiane and carry out military activities, using Thai military strongholds and firing artillery at the Lao government forces in North Kading, and using the Mekong River bank within Thailand and using Thai gunboats to attack the gunboats of the Lao Kingdom government.

The statement pointed out that, even more dangerously, they are blatantly helping the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group to create riots in Vientiane, such as transporting weapons and war materials to the rebel group from within Thailand. The Deputy Director-General of the Thai Police even directly assisted the Phoumi Nosavan group in attacking Vientiane; allowing the Phoumi Nosavan rebels to cross the river from Thailand and land south of Vientiane.

The statement pointed out that the above-mentioned actions of U.S. imperialism and the Thai reactionaries are more blatant and brutal than ever before in trampling on the sovereignty of the Lao people, trampling on the Geneva Agreements on the Laos issue, and international law. The armed interference and aggression of U.S. imperialism and Thai reactionaries against Laos seriously threatens peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia, and is also a provocation against peace-loving people all over the world.

The statement called on all the people of Laos to rise up together in cooperation with the government army and the armed forces of the Lao Fighting Forces to resolutely oppose the interference and aggression of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, resolutely oppose the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group, defend the capital Vientiane, defend the motherland, defend the legitimate government of Prince Souvanna Phouma, and defend the policy of peace, neutrality, and national harmony.

The statement finally demanded that peace-loving and justice-loving people all over the world, as well as the governments of all countries that respect international law, resolutely condemn and oppose the illegal and unjust actions of U.S. imperialism and the Thai reactionaries, and support the Lao people's struggle for peace, neutrality, democracy, and justice.

    新华社河内10日电　据寮国战斗部队电台今天晚间广播，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会发言人发表声明，严厉谴责美帝国主义和泰国反动派粗暴干涉和侵略老挝的行为。
    声明指出，美帝国主义为了实现它的进攻万象、颠复老挝王国合法政府、在老挝建立反动的傀儡政府的阴谋，正在加紧动员东南亚条约军事集团的一切反动势力，首先是泰国的反动派，同老挝的富米·诺萨万叛乱集团进行更阴险的、更频繁的勾结活动。
    声明列举大量事实证明，美帝国主义和泰国反动派是老挝叛国集团进攻万象事件的主谋者。声明说，他们向富米·诺萨万叛乱集团提供武器、弹药，并在各方面给予帮助。泰国反动集团并且把泰国的国土作为富米·诺萨万叛军进攻万象和进行军事活动的跳板，利用泰国的军事据点并且用大炮射击在北卡定的老挝政府军，利用泰国境内湄公河岸并且用泰国的炮艇攻击老挝王国政府的炮艇。
    声明指出，更危险的是，他们明目张胆地帮助富米·诺萨万叛乱集团在万象制造暴乱。如从泰国境内向叛乱集团运送武器和战争物资。泰国警察副总监甚至直接帮助富米·诺萨万集团进攻万象；让富米·诺萨万叛军从泰国渡江，在万象南面登陆。
    声明指出，美帝国主义和泰国反动派的上述行为是比任何时候都更加明目张胆地、粗暴地蹂躏老挝人民的主权，蹂躏关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议和国际法。美帝国主义和泰国反动分子对老挝的武装干涉和侵略，严重地威胁着印度支那和东南亚的和平，也是对全世界爱好和平人民的一种挑衅。
    声明号召老挝全体人民共同起来同政府军队和寮国战斗部队武装力量合作，坚决反对美帝国主义及其走狗的干涉和侵略，坚决反对富米·诺萨万叛乱集团，保卫首都万象，保卫祖国，保卫梭发那·富马亲王的合法政府，保卫和平中立和民族和睦政策。
    声明最后要求，全世界爱好和平和正义的人民以及尊重国际法的各国政府坚决斥责和反对美帝国主义和泰国反动分子的违法和非正义的行动，并支持老挝人民为和平中立和民主和正义而进行的斗争。
