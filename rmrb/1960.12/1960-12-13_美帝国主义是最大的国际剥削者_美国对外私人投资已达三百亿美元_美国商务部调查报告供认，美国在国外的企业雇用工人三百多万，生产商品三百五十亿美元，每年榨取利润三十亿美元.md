Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Washington dispatch: A survey report published this year by the U.S. Department of Commerce, titled "U.S. Business and Investment Abroad," shows that U.S. imperialism is the world's largest international exploiter.

The Department of Commerce report states that the total amount of U.S. private direct investment abroad currently reaches $30 billion, a figure about two and a half times that of ten years ago.

The report points out that these capitals have opened enterprises abroad employing more than 3 million workers from various countries, extracting more than $3 billion in profits annually from them.

The report says that more than half of this $30 billion in foreign private direct investment is controlled by 45 large U.S. monopoly enterprises, each with more than $100 million in foreign investment. At the same time, nearly three-quarters of this $30 billion is invested in foreign companies in which the United States holds more than 95% of the shares.

The Department of Commerce report points out that the quantity of many types of goods produced by factories owned by the United States in many countries has exceeded the quantity of similar goods exported from the United States to these countries. The report says that the total value of goods produced by U.S.-owned enterprises abroad reached $32 billion in 1957 and has now increased to approximately $35 billion.

The report states that the outflow of U.S. capital is greatest in the petroleum industry, currently exceeding $10 billion, while the capital outflow in machinery manufacturing is also rapidly increasing.

The report points out that more than one-third of U.S. private foreign investment is in Canada, with the capital invested in Latin America only slightly less than this amount, and U.S. investment in Europe exceeds $5 billion. Currently, Europe is the region where U.S. private investment is increasing the fastest.

U.S. "Business Week" recently quoted U.S. Department of Commerce materials in an issue, pointing out that U.S. monopoly capital groups, fearing the increasingly high tide of national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and at the same time, in order to break the barriers of Western European countries and their colonial spheres of influence resisting imports of U.S. goods, are currently increasing capital exports to Western Europe. "Business Week" wrote that in 1960, U.S. machinery manufacturing capitalists invested $1.3 billion in foreign factory equipment, an increase of $100 million compared to 1958 and 1959. Of this $1.3 billion, 44% was invested in Western Europe. About $300 million was invested in the United Kingdom, and about $270 million was invested in the Western European "Common Market" countries. Investment in West Germany accounted for two-thirds of U.S. capital exports to the "Common Market" countries. According to "Business Week" estimates, U.S. capital exports to Western Europe will increase further next year, possibly accounting for half of the total capital exports next year.

    美帝国主义是最大的国际剥削者
    美国对外私人投资已达三百亿美元
    美国商务部调查报告供认，美国在国外的企业雇用工人三百多万，生产商品三百五十亿美元，每年榨取利润三十亿美元
    新华社11日讯　华盛顿消息：美国商务部今年发表的一份题为《美国在外国的商业与投资》的调查报告表明，美国帝国主义是世界上最大的国际剥削者。
    商务部的报告说，美国目前在国外的私人直接投资总额达三百亿美元，这个数字约为十年前的两倍半。
    报告指出，这些资本在国外开设的企业雇用着三百多万各国工人，每年从中榨取三十亿美元以上的利润。
    报告说，在这三百亿美元的对外私人直接投资中，有一半以上掌握在四十五家美国大垄断企业手中，它们每家都拥有一亿美元以上的国外投资。同时，这三百亿美元中将近四分之三是投放在美国占有95％以上股份的国外企业中。
    商务部的报告指出，美国在许多国家中拥有的工厂所生产的许多种商品的数量，已经超过从美国向这些国家输出的同类商品的数量。这份报告说，美国在国外拥有的企业所生产的商品总值1957年达三百二十亿美元，目前已增加到约三百五十亿美元。
    报告说，美国资本的输出在石油工业中最多，目前已超过一百亿美元，同时在机器制造业方面输出的资本也正在迅速增加。
    报告指出，美国私人国外投资有三分之一以上投在加拿大，投在拉丁美洲的资本只略少于这个数额，美国在欧洲的投资有五十多亿美元。目前，欧洲是美国私人投资增加得最快的地区。
    美国《商业周刊》在不久前的一期中引用美国商务部的材料指出，美国垄断资本集团由于害怕亚、非、拉丁美洲日益高涨的民族独立运动，同时为了打破西欧国家及其殖民势力范围抵制进口美国商品的壁垒，目前正在增加对西欧的资本输出。《商业周刊》写道，1960年美国机器制造业资本家在国外工厂设备的投资达十三亿美元，比1958年和1959年增加一亿美元。在这十三亿美元中，投到西欧的占44％。其中约有三亿美元投在英国，约有二亿七千万美元投在西欧“共同市场”国家。投在西德的又占美国向“共同市场”国家输出资本的三分之二。据《商业周刊》估计，美国明年向西欧输出的资本还会增加，可能占明年资本输出总额的一半。
