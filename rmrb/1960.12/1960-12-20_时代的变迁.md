    The Changes of the Times
    Liu Zhengyong
    When casually flipping through the gazetteer of Pinglu County in Shanxi, a historical fact caught my attention and prompted deep thought:
    “In the third year of Guangxu (1877), there was no rain for a hundred days. The autumn and summer harvests completely failed, and even the winter wheat could not be sown.
    “The price of wheat rose from four or five qian of silver per dou to five liang; the price of millet rose from two or three hundred cash per dou to three thousand. Even with good land, there was nothing one could do. Without a single grain, how could one manage meals? At first, people bartered their clothes and belongings to survive, then sold their sons and daughters to prolong life. Eventually, everything was pawned and sold, and hunger became unbearable. Some peeled tree bark to eat, others dug up grass roots to suck on. When a father died, the son did not bury him, but ate his flesh to stave off hunger; when a son died, the father did not grieve, but broke his bones for fuel.
    “In Pinglu and Rui, the total population of civilians was about 145,000, but only about 34,000 remained. Eight or nine out of ten died.”
    Look, what a tragic and heartbreaking history! This is a true portrayal of the suffering of the working people under the dark and reactionary rule of the old society!
    In the same Pinglu County, from last year's autumn harvest to July of this year, there was almost no significant rain for nearly three hundred days, and no rain at all for over a hundred days. The drought was even worse than in the third year of Guangxu. But under the leadership of the Party, the 120,000 people of the county went all out to fight against the heavens and finally overcame the drought. Compared with the tragic scene of "complete failure of the autumn and summer harvests" and no harvest in the third year of Guangxu, the difference is like heaven and earth!
    Not only that, but the 400,000 mu of wheat fields in the county were sown better and earlier this year than in any previous year. Currently, on the Zhongtiao Mountains, both on the slopes and at the foot, the wheat seedlings are growing lush and green, like a beautiful carpet, truly delightful. Seeing this scene that heralds a bumper harvest next year, and recalling the tragic situation in the third year of Guangxu, where "winter wheat could not be sown" and "houses were in ruins, and the land was barren," how can we not deeply feel the incomparable happiness of living in the Mao Zedong era!
    The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are always concerned about the people's lives. The county Party secretary and the commune Party committee secretaries have all gone to the canteens to personally take charge of life and promote production. It is indeed true that "when the secretary goes to the canteen, life changes greatly!" Every family lives and works in peace and contentment, and everyone is at ease in production. Compared with the tragic situation in the third year of Guangxu, where grain prices soared, families were broken up, sons and daughters were sold, fathers and sons ate each other, and eight or nine out of ten died, how can we not deeply feel the incomparable happiness of living in the new society?
    History is the best textbook of life. Only those who have personally experienced the suffering of the old society can more deeply appreciate the happiness of today's new society. At the symposium of people from all walks of life in Pinglu, the eighty-year-old man Ma Yongli said it well: "In such a year of great disaster, fortunately, we have the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, otherwise we would have been scattered and fled east and west like in the third year of Guangxu. Living to this day, I am truly无比 happy!" Are not the old man's words the voice from the bottom of the hearts of all working people?
    Of course, our production level is still not very high, and we still face some difficulties. But what are these difficulties compared to the past? Fighting against today's difficulties is to live a happier life tomorrow. To struggle for the cause of communism is the greatest happiness.

    时代的变迁
    刘正庸
    偶翻山西平陆县志，有一件历史事实，发人深思：
    “光绪三年丁丑，百日无雨，秋夏一概不登，宿麦亦未得种。
    “每麦一斗，价银自四五钱起，至五两许；每谷一斗，价钱自二三百起，至三千零。纵有良田，莫措手足，既无颗粒，奚办饔飧。始而货服物以糊口，继而鬻子女以偷生。久之，典卖已罄，饿馁难支，剥树皮而食者有之，挖草根而啜者有之，父殁而子不葬，啖其肉以救饥，子死而父弗悲，析其骸以为爨。
    “惟吾平与芮，统计平民共十四五万零口，留者不过三四万零口，死者十之八九。”
    看看，这是多么惨绝人寰的血泪史啊！这也正是在旧社会黑暗反动统治下，劳动人民惨苦生活的一幅写照！
    仍旧是平陆县这个地方，自去年秋收后至今年7月，近三百天没下一场透雨，其中一百余天滴雨未落，旱灾比光绪三年还重。但在党的领导下，全县十二万人民，全力以赴，与天斗争，终于战胜了旱灾。这与光绪三年“秋夏一概不登”颗粒不收的惨景相比真是天差地别！
    不仅如此，全县四十万亩麦田今年比过去任何一年都种得好，种得早。目前，中条山山上山下，麦苗长得绿油油的，像一幅美丽的地毯，真令人喜爱；看见这预报着来年的丰收的景象，回忆光绪三年“宿麦亦未得种”“庐舍为墟，遍地荒芜”的悲惨局面，我们能不深感生活在毛泽东时代的无比幸福吗！
    党中央和毛主席时刻关心人民生活，县委书记、公社党委书记都下到了食堂，亲自动手抓生活、促生产。真是“书记到食堂，生活大变样”！家家安居乐业，人人安心生产。这与光绪三年，粮价飞涨，妻离子散，卖儿鬻女，父子相食，死者十之八九的悲惨景况相比，我们能不深感生活在新社会里的无比幸福吗？
    历史是生活的最好教科书。只有亲身经历过旧社会痛苦的人，才更深切体会到今天新社会的幸福。在平陆各界人士座谈会上，八十余岁的马永里老汉说得好：“这样大灾年，幸亏有共产党和毛主席领导，不然我们就会像光绪三年一样早就妻离子散，东逃西奔了。我活到现在，真是无比幸福！”老人这话不正是所有劳动人民心底里的声音吗？
    当然，目前我们的生产水平还不很高，在我们面前还有一些困难。但是这些困难与过去比起来又算得了什么呢？同今天的困难作斗争，就是为了明天过更幸福的生活。为共产主义事业而奋斗，才是最大的幸福。
