Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd dispatch from Léopoldville: Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba was kidnapped by the Mobutu traitorous clique on December 1st, while en route to Stanleyville, the capital of Orientale Province, at Port Franqui, northwest of Luluabourg, the capital of Kasai Province. On December 2nd, this clique used an airplane to escort him back to Léopoldville and imprisoned him in the Pinza military camp.

Under the planning and instigation of U.S. imperialism, the Mobutu rebel clique has recently intensified its activities to attack the legitimate Lumumba government. According to reports, ever since Lumumba left Léopoldville on the 27th, the UN authorities and the Mobutu clique have been very alarmed. UN personnel hurriedly held meetings. On the 28th, Mobutu immediately dispatched his armed forces to search house by house around Lumumba's residence and ordered the troops under his control in Léopoldville and Équateur provinces to "detain and arrest Lumumba if possible."

The day after Lumumba was kidnapped (December 2nd), the U.S.-manipulated UN authorities immediately issued a communiqué on the incident, stating that the "UN forces" in the Congo had received "strict orders not to interfere with Lumumba's actions under any circumstances." Therefore, "the UN bears no responsibility for Lumumba's actions." In other words, the "UN forces" will not interfere with the traitor Mobutu's detention or persecution of Lumumba, and attempt to shirk the responsibility that the UN should bear for this.

    在联合国当局纵容下
    蒙博托竟武装绑架卢蒙巴
    据新华社3日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果总理卢蒙巴在去东方省省会斯坦利维尔途中，1日，在开赛省省会路路阿堡西北的弗朗基港遭到蒙博托叛国集团的武装绑架，并且于2日被这个集团用飞机押回到利奥波德维尔，监禁在平扎军营。
    在美帝国主义的策划和指使下，蒙博托叛乱集团最近加紧进行打击卢蒙巴合法政府的活动。据报道，自从卢蒙巴27日离开利奥波德维尔之后，联合国当局和蒙博托集团感到十分惊慌。联合国人员急忙举行会议。蒙博托28日立即出动他的武装在卢蒙巴住宅周围挨户搜查，并下令利奥波德维尔省和赤道省的他所控制的军队，“如果可能，就扣留并逮捕卢蒙巴”。
    在卢蒙巴被绑架的第二天（2日），美国操纵的联合国当局立即就这一事件发表公报说，在刚果的“联合国军”得到“严格的命令，在任何情况下，不干涉卢蒙巴的行动”，因此，“联合国对卢蒙巴的行动不负任何责任。”换句话说，就是“联合国军”不干涉叛徒蒙博托囚禁或迫害卢蒙巴的行动，并企图推卸联合国对此应负的责任。
