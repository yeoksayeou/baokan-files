Arranging Production Plans Daily and by Shift, Carrying Out Internal and External Collaboration
    Comprehensive Leap Forward in Coal Mining, Tunneling, and Transportation at Jingxi Mines
    (Our report) The Jingxi Mining Bureau completed its annual national coal mining and tunneling plans thirty-one and thirty-two days ahead of schedule, respectively, at the end of November. In the first eleven months, the bureau also completed its planned external coal transfer tasks to Hebei, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, and other regions, achieving a comprehensive leap forward in coal mining, tunneling, and transportation. The completion of other economic indicators is as follows: In the first eleven months, raw coal costs were reduced by 1.79% compared to the national plan, pit wood consumption was reduced by 33.2% compared to the national plan, and the recovery rate of various coal seams exceeded the national standards. The ash content and gangue content of raw coal were lower than the national plan by 1.53% and 1.26%, respectively.
    The first experience of the bureau's comprehensive leap forward this year is to combine soaring revolutionary enthusiasm with a down-to-earth work style. They arrange the production tasks for the next month around the 20th of each month and make specific arrangements on a daily and shift basis. Each time a plan is formulated and arranged, it is fully discussed by all employees, and practical and feasible specific measures are drawn up, so that the monthly, daily, and team plans are all implemented. After the plans and measures are formulated, leading cadres at all levels go deep into the front line underground to specifically organize production and solve specific problems in the process of realizing the plan in a timely manner, ensuring the thorough realization of the plans and measures.
    At the same time, in accordance with the characteristics of coal mine production, they have always paid attention to grasping production preparation work, especially tunneling work. All mines have leading cadres who specialize in tunneling, and a special office has also been established to specifically plan and arrange tunneling work, thereby effectively guaranteeing the priority of tunneling. In the second half of each month, the whole bureau pays attention to preparing for the replacement of working faces for the next month; in the previous quarter, it paid attention to developing coal volume for the next quarter, so that the average monthly number of mining working faces increased from 52.77 last year to 57.28 in the first ten months of this year, thereby ensuring the smooth progress of coal mining work.
    Continuously carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution is another experience of the bureau's sustained leap forward this year. When the Muchengjian Coal Mine innovated coal mining methods, more than 420 workers in the mine put forward 1,053 suggestions, drew 120 sketches, and made many major improvements in coal mining methods after 15 summaries, greatly reducing the production process of coal mining. In the first ten months, the mine's recovery efficiency increased by 64.4%, and the annual coal mining and tunneling plans were completed ahead of schedule at the end of October. Employees of other mines have also continuously improved coal mining methods according to different geological conditions and local conditions. Now, thousands of workers in the bureau have been freed from heavy manual labor such as "shoveling, carrying, pushing, and unloading."
    The third experience of the bureau in achieving a comprehensive and sustained leap forward is that all employees have established the idea of "the whole country as one chess game." The employees deeply realize the importance of increasing coal production to the country's industrial and agricultural production. They always link their work with the situation of the whole country and overcome difficulties in every possible way to increase coal production. When the country launched the increased production and economy practice centered on grain and steel this year, the geological conditions of the Datai Coal Mine suddenly changed, the coal seam became thinner, and the amount of tunneling increased. According to past experience, output must be reduced. However, all the employees of the mine knew that the raw coal produced by their mine was to be supplied to Tianjin, Baoding, Jiangsu, and other places. If the national plan was not completed, it would inevitably affect the completion of the increased production and economy practice in these areas. After discussion, they studied and improved coal mining methods day and night, made full use of the space of thin coal seams, and launched a large-scale tunneling performance competition to accelerate tunneling speed. After such efforts, they finally created a high-yield record of more than 10,000 tons per month on the thin coal seam working face, and completed the annual national tunneling and coal mining plans eighty and sixty-five days ahead of schedule in the bureau.
    Under the guidance of the idea of "the whole country as one chess game," the bureau has carried out communist collaboration both internally and externally. Internally, the vast number of tunneling workers hold rapid tunneling competitions every month to develop working faces as soon as possible and actively create conditions for recovery workers. All production auxiliary departments, administrative departments, and life service departments are unanimously oriented to the front line of underground mining and tunneling, and strive to prepare materials such as tools, equipment, and materials in advance. The electromechanical department took the initiative to go to the working face to repair mining machinery. The material supply department established an underground material station to supply electric drills, pit wood, gunpowder, parts, and other items to mining and tunneling workers in a timely manner. The transportation department greatly improved the degree of mechanization and automation of transportation by reforming the line and extending the trolley line by more than 8,800 meters. At the same time, it strengthened vehicle dispatching, accelerated the turnover of coal trucks, and ensured that there were enough coal trucks available underground, creating favorable conditions for high mining production. While carrying out internal collaboration, the bureau also carried out road-mine collaboration with the Beijing Office of the Beijing Railway Bureau, thereby ensuring the completion of the coal transportation plan.

### 按日按班安排生产计划  内部外部开展大协作  京西矿采煤、掘进、调运全面跃进

    按日按班安排生产计划  内部外部开展大协作
    京西矿采煤、掘进、调运全面跃进
    本报讯　京西矿务局在11月底分别提前三十一天和三十二天完成了全年国家采煤和掘进计划；前十一个月对河北、上海、江苏、浙江、湖北等地的原煤外调任务，也已按计划完成，实现了采煤、掘进、调运工作全面跃进。其他各项经济指标完成的情况是：前十一个月原煤成本比国家计划降低1.79％，坑木消耗比国家计划降低33.2％，各种煤层的回采率都超过了国家规定的标准。原煤灰分和含矸率分别低于国家计划1.53％和1.26％。
    这个局今年全面跃进的第一个经验是，把冲天的革命干劲和踏踏实实的工作作风结合起来。他们每个月20日左右就安排下月生产任务，并且按日按班进行具体安排。每次制订和安排计划，都经过全体职工的充分讨论，订出切实可行的具体措施。使月、日、班、组计划全部落实。在计划和措施订出之后，各级领导干部又分别深入井下第一线，具体组织生产，及时解决实现计划过程中的具体问题，保证计划、措施的彻底实现。
    与此同时，还根据煤矿生产的特点，一直注意抓生产准备工作，特别是掘进工作。所有矿井都有专门抓掘进的领导干部，还成立了专门办公室对掘进工作进行具体规划和安排，从而有力地保证了掘进先行。全局每月下旬就注意为下月做好工作面接替的准备；上一季就注意为下一季开拓出获得煤量，使平均每月的回采工作面从去年的五十二点七七个增加到今年前十个月的五十七点二八个。从而保证了采煤工作的顺利进行。
    不断进行技术革新和技术革命，是这个局今年持续跃进的另一条经验。木城涧煤矿在革新采煤方法时，全矿四百二十多工人提出一千零五十三条建议，绘制了一百二十张草图，先后经过十五次总结，在采煤方法上进行了许多重大的改进，使采煤的生产工序大大减少。前十个月全矿回采效率提高了64.4％，10月底就提前完成了全年采煤和掘进计划。其他各矿的职工也都根据不同地质条件，因地制宜地不断改进了采煤方法。现在全局已有几千工人摆脱了“攉、背、推、卸”等笨重体力劳动。
    这个局实现全面持续跃进的第三条经验，是全局职工树立了“全国一盘棋”的思想。职工们深刻认识到增产煤炭对全国工农业生产的重要意义，他们时刻把自己的每一项工作和全国的形势联系起来，为增产煤炭千方百计克服困难。今年全国开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动时，大台煤矿的地质条件忽然发生变化，煤层变薄，掘进量增多，按照过去规律，一定要降低产量。但是全矿职工知道本矿生产的原煤要供应天津、保定、江苏等地，如果完不成国家计划，势必影响这些地区增产节约计划的完成。经过讨论后，他们就日夜研究改进采煤方法，充分利用薄煤层的空间，同时大搞掘进表演赛、一顶几赛，来加快掘进速度。经过这样的努力后，终于在薄煤层的工作面上，创造了月产万吨以上的高产纪录，提前八十天和六十五天在全局最早完成了全年国家掘进和采煤计划。
    在“全国一盘棋”的思想指导下，这个局在内部和外部都开展了共产主义大协作。在内部，广大掘进工人月月举行快速掘进的竞赛，及早开拓出工作面，积极为回采工创造条件。各个生产辅助部门、科室管理部门、生活服务部门，一致面向井下采掘第一线，努力提前做好工具、设备、材料等物质准备。机电部门主动到工作面去检修采掘机械。材料供应部门建立井下材料站，及时把电钻、坑木、火药、零件等供应给采掘工人。运输部门通过改革线路，延长电车架线八千八百多米，使运输机械化、自动化程度大大提高，同时加强车辆调度工作，加快煤车周转，保证井下有足够的煤车供应，为采掘高产创造了良好条件。在内部大协作的同时，全局又和北京铁路局北京办事处开展路矿大协作，从而保证了煤炭调运计划的完成。
