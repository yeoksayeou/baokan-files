Xinhua News Agency, December 1st, Washington Dispatch: High-ranking U.S. military officers stationed overseas are scheduled to meet today in Omaha, Nebraska, to discuss the "strategic targets of the enemy" that the United States will attack in the event of launching a war of aggression. This meeting was convened by U.S. Secretary of Defense Gates following an order he issued recently. According to the Associated Press, the "main issue" to be discussed at this meeting will be to "revise the strategic target list (for U.S. attacks)" in light of "changes in technology and target value."

The Associated Press also revealed that the personnel studying this "target list" are "assigning (attack) targets" for various U.S. weapon systems, including medium-range missiles on overseas bases, nuclear-offensive aircraft on aircraft carriers, heavy and medium bombers of the Strategic Air Command, as well as "Polaris" nuclear missile submarines and intercontinental missiles.

The Associated Press propagandized that at the time of this meeting, the United States already had what is called "a completely new strategic weapon attack system beginning to be operational." The first U.S. submarine capable of launching "Polaris" nuclear missiles, the "George Washington," is currently conducting provocative "patrols" somewhere off the northwest coast of Europe, and the second and third submarines will also join the "patrols" in the coming weeks.

The Associated Press also pointed out that even while intercontinental missile bases in the United States are still under construction and intercontinental missiles are still being tested, the United States is already impatiently beginning to draw up "target lists" for them.

According to the Associated Press, those attending this meeting include: U.S. Secretary of Defense Gates, the civilian secretaries of the three armed services, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and almost all commanders of unified commands. The commanders of the unified commands include: Powell of the Strategic Air Command, Carter of the North American Air Defense Command, Palmer, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of Europe representing Norstad, Felt of the Pacific Command, Smith of the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Naval Forces, Denison of the Atlantic Command, Armstrong of the Alaska Command, and Sink of the Caribbean Command.

    洲际导弹尚在试制　就要拟订袭击目标
    美国杀气腾腾开军事会议
    新华社1日讯　华盛顿消息：美国派驻海外各地区的三军高级将领，定于今天在内布拉斯加州的奥马哈城举行会议，讨论美国在一旦发动侵略战争时将要攻击的“敌方的战略目标”。这次会议是美国国防部长盖茨在不久前发出命令召集的。据美联社说，在这次会议上要讨论的“主要问题”将是参照“技术和目标价值的改变”来“修订（美国进行袭击的）战略目标单”。
    美联社还透露，研究这个“目标单”的人员，正在为美国的各种武器系统“分配（袭击）目标”，其中包括海外基地上的中程导弹、航空母舰上的核进攻飞机、战略空军司令部的重型和中型轰炸机以及“北极星”核导弹潜艇和洲际导弹。
    美联社宣传，在举行这次会议的时候，美国已经有所谓“一个全新的战略武器攻击系统开始可以作战使用”，美国第一艘能够发射“北极星”核导弹的潜艇“乔治·华盛顿”号，目前正在欧洲西北海岸某地进行挑衅性“巡逻”，第二艘和第三艘也将在今后几周参加“巡逻”。
    美联社还指出，甚至当美国国内洲际导弹基地尚在建造、洲际导弹尚在试制的时候，已迫不及待地在开始为它们拟订袭击“目标单”了。
  据美联社说，参加这次会议的有：美国国防部长盖茨、三军的文职部长、参谋长联席会议和统一司令部的几乎所有的司令们。统一司令部的司令们包括：战略空军司令部的鲍威尔，北美空防司令部的卡特，将代表诺斯塔德的欧洲副总司令帕麦尔，太平洋司令费耳特，东大西洋和地中海海军部队司令史密斯，大西洋司令丹尼逊，阿拉斯加司令阿姆斯特朗和加勒比司令辛克。
