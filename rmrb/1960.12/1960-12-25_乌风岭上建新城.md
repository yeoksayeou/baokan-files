　　The majestic Crow Wind Ridge, 1,700 meters above sea level, stands tall in the center of the famous revolutionary base area of Damao Mountain.

　　Crow Wind Ridge is a treasure mountain. The trees and thatch bamboo on the mountain are inexhaustible; the mountain scenery is breathtaking. In those years, the martyr Fang Zhimin used this as a base to lead the people of northeastern Jiangxi to raise the revolutionary red flag. At that time, the Red Army moved east and west, and the masses came and went frequently. The ridge was once a prosperous revolutionary mountain town. After the Red Army left, it was brutally looted by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Houses were burned down, fields were barren, and cooking smoke disappeared. From then on, Crow Wind Ridge was called "Bitter Pain Ridge."

　　In the winter of 1957, ninety-six cadres from the directly subordinate organs of Jiangxi Province enthusiastically responded to the Party's call to go up to the mountains and down to the countryside for labor training, and came to Crow Wind Ridge. Through their three years of hard work, today's Crow Wind Ridge is no longer what it used to be. It has put on a more beautiful new look and has become a more prosperous new mountain city.

　　Starting a Business on the Mountain

　　I remember it was a snowy day in 1957.

　　The song "Young Communist International" came from under Crow Wind Ridge:

　　Go forward! The dawn is ahead.
　　Comrades, fight, with our bayonets and guns,
　　Open our own path...

　　The song reawakened the silent and desolate Crow Wind Ridge. This was a mountain construction team composed of ninety-six cadres from provincial-level organs and enterprises in Jiangxi, led by Fang Zichun, the secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee and a veteran Red Army soldier who fought in Damao Mountain. They came to Crow Wind Ridge again. Carrying their luggage and tools, braving the wind and snow, and following in the footsteps of the Red Army, they encouraged each other with the battle song "Young Communist International," cutting through thorns and climbing Crow Wind Ridge. They were determined to settle down and start a business here, and build the Red Army's revolutionary base area into a new socialist mountain area.

　　As soon as they arrived on the mountain, they immediately began to rebuild their homes. At the beginning, dozens of people were squeezed into a thatched shed temporarily built with cogon grass and branches, sleeping on grass mats made of cogon grass. When one person turned over, the entire thatched shed vibrated. At night, the storm broke through the roof, it snowed heavily outside, and it snowed lightly inside. Before long, the ice and snow inside turned into rainwater, and everyone's shoes floated like small boats. But none of them complained of hardship or cold. Everyone got up from the铺without caring, held up umbrellas to block the broken holes in the house, and sang self-composed mountain songs face to face: Crow Wind Ridge is red, red, our hearts are as red as the mountain, we are not afraid of wind and rain, our determination is like steel to build a mountain city....

　　To settle down, the first thing to do is to build a house! This is the first step. But building a house requires bricks and tiles, and they searched all over the mountain, but it was all white sandy soil, which could not be fired into bricks and tiles at all. So they decided to use local materials, using mountain thatch and bamboo to build the roof frame, and mountain grass and bark to weave the roof. However, on this steep and precipitous mountain, even cutting a bamboo was not so easy. They had to climb cliffs and sometimes be attacked by wild animals. But everyone unanimously scrambled to take on this arduous task. Finally, the Party branch selected dozens of young and strong lads, led by Yu Heling, and set off in the wind and snow. The commando team braved the misty snow, climbed cliffs, cut and transported bamboo and wood one by one, bundle by bundle, and collected and transported *Ruoye* skins. Often, if they were not careful, they would slide down dozens of feet from the steep and icy hillside. If they slid down, they would grab the branches and climb up again, pat the mud and snow off their bodies, and throw themselves back into battle. In this way, after hard work, they carried the materials themselves, built the mud walls themselves, and built the first batch of simple new houses on the barren mountains, settling down preliminarily.

　　By the time the houses were built, it was already spring, and just as they were preparing to start wasteland reclamation and production, the mountain torrents formed by the accumulated snow on the mountain cut off their grain transportation route. Seeing that the food ration was decreasing day by day, dozens of people were trapped on the mountain. Production was imminent, and the grain road was cut off again. The Party branch studied this situation and decided to send Communist Party member Jiang Bao'an to lead a dozen Party and Youth League members to break through the flood encirclement and cross the river to transport grain down the mountain. When the people at the foot of the mountain heard that their loved ones who were building Crow Wind Ridge were about to run out of food, they took out their own grain to lend to them, and sent three representatives to send the grain up the mountain. The care and support of the mountain people gave the down-to-earth cadres another profound and unforgettable lesson, further encouraging their determination to build Crow Wind Ridge. Yan Zhenyou, the secretary of the Party branch, held the hands of the villagers who sent grain and said: We must start a family and establish a business on Crow Wind Ridge, blossom and bear fruit, and Crow Wind Ridge must hand over more grain to repay the deep friendship of the villagers.

　　Reclaiming Wasteland to Seize Grain

　　Spring plowing began. In early spring, Crow Wind Ridge, ice frost was still hanging on the rocks.

　　"Marching into the mountains and demanding grain from the mountains" This was the battle call issued by the Party branch to all comrades. Everyone invested in the wasteland reclamation battle like tigers. The land on the mountain, which had been barren for many years, was covered with weeds and thorns as deep as a person, and piled up with rocks and rubble. The cadres first burned the miscellaneous trees and weeds to drive away mountain birds, snakes, and beasts. The wasteland was full of tree roots and stones, and the plow could not plow it. They dug it with a hoe, one stroke at a time, and chopped it, one stroke at a time. The hoe fell down, hit the stone, and hit the tree stump, shaking the tiger's mouth and tearing the arms with soreness. Many people had blood blisters on their hands. Many people's shoes and clothes were worn out. But they still insisted on fighting, going out early and returning late every day, working hard and opening up continuously. But the progress of wasteland reclamation was still very slow. At this time, some people were a little anxious, and some said: "I am not afraid of any difficult work, but this hoe is too slow!" Some said: "How long will it take to plant grain!"

　　Lai, the youngest of the cadres, was sweating profusely and desperately digging the ground one day, when suddenly there was a "crash," and there seemed to be something under the hoe. At this time, everyone gathered around, and took out two black iron bowls with脱了enamel from under the hoe. After picking them up and looking at them carefully, there was a faintly painted military whistle on the back of the bottom of the bowl. What is this for? After the analysis of the veteran Red Army soldiers who had made revolution here, everyone realized that it was the tea bowl that the Red Army carried when fighting in those years. Suddenly, there was a jubilation on the construction site. The secretary of the Party branch said excitedly to everyone: "The older generation of Red Army soldiers persisted in the revolution on the ridge in the past, fought bravely, and did not hesitate to sacrifice. Today, we are engaged in construction in the revolutionary place of the Red Army. We must inherit the revolutionary tradition of hard struggle of the old Red Army, and we must not forget the spirit of the Red Army even if we have a hoe. We have not been reclaiming wasteland for a few days, and some people are anxious, this is not the spirit of the Red Army." At this time, the comrades answered loudly in unison: "We must learn from the old Red Army! We must inherit the glorious tradition of the Red Army!" So the speed of wasteland reclamation was accelerated. Everyone had a determination and a belief: not afraid of hardship, not afraid of difficulty, we must turn barren land into fertile fields! While working hard, everyone also worked cleverly, thought of ways, and engaged in innovation, and the efficiency of wasteland reclamation was doubled compared with the original.

　　With the concerted efforts and hard work of the down-to-earth cadres, relying only on dozens of hands, in more than half a month, more than 70 acres of wasteland were reclaimed on the mountain. Almost all the wasteland that could be reclaimed on the mountain was reclaimed, and spring-sown crops were planted in time.

　　In the autumn of that year, this group of down-to-earth cadres began to realize their wish to "must make Crow Wind Ridge grow more grain." Crow Wind Ridge had its first harvest. The total output of potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn and other crops planted was more than 30,000 jin when converted into rice. Among them, the yield per unit area of potatoes and sweet potatoes was as high as more than 8,000 jin. The yield of white and large radish was more than 3,000 jin per mu. Watermelons, which were always considered that could not grow in high mountains, also grew to be more than 8 jin.

　　Then in the second year and the third year, they adopted the method of mixed planting of forest and grain, and expanded the cultivated land area by more than 300 mu. This year, the total grain output has increased to more than 120,000 jin, and the total output of various vegetables has increased to more than 100,000 jin, achieving self-sufficiency in grain and vegetables with surplus.

　　Taking Treasure from the Mountain

　　There are ten thousand treasures on Crow Wind Ridge,
　　It all depends on how big or small the work is;
　　The more work, the more treasures,
　　The less work, the fewer treasures.

　　The most on the mountain are pine forests. In addition to being used as wood, a large number of pine branches and pine stumps are discarded. The down-to-earth cadres saw that many oily substances were condensed on the pine trees, and decided to use them to extract pine oil first. But none of them had studied oil refining, and they did not have any technical information at hand. They relied on a spirit of hard work and a spirit of daring to create. They carried pots and steamers to the mountains and forests to set up camp and study and experiment on the spot. Wang Qisheng, Wan Shuhui and others began to try steam distillation with wooden steamers, and Lu Chunlong, Wu Mingtong and others tried to boil with sprayers. Everyone adopted various methods and experimented repeatedly. Finally, Communist Party member Lu Chunlong finally extracted more than half a bowl of concentrated pine oil with a pottery jar. This further encouraged everyone's enthusiasm, and as a result, a large amount of pine crude oil was extracted. With pine crude oil, they tried every means to fractionate gasoline, diesel, mineral processing oil, lubricating oil and many other valuable industrial oils from the crude oil. In addition, more than 30 kinds of forest chemical raw materials such as rosin, turpentine, pine needle oil, tannin extract, activated carbon, paraffin wax, and alcohol were extracted from pine trees. In this way, dozens of "treasures" were obtained from pine trees alone. They also used bamboo to make paper, and used various wild fruits and wild plants to make wine.... Last year, they discovered a wild *Lycoris radiata* containing highly toxic properties on the mountain, and used this wild *Lycoris radiata* to extract extremely valuable acetone and butanol for industrial use.

　　In the past three years, they have taken treasures from the mountains, used every grass and tree on the mountain, started from scratch, and created a large number of forest by-products and chemical raw materials for the country, creating a wealth of 1.37 million yuan for the country.

　　New Look of the Mountain City

　　Crow Wind Ridge, in the construction of ninety-six down-to-earth cadres soaked in wind and rain, a new look is displayed in front of people, it has become a veritable new mountain city.

　　When the cadres went up to the mountain, there was almost no way to go to Crow Wind Ridge. Now, wide winding mountain roads have been built, and cars can reach the top of the mountain directly. Climbing up Crow Wind Ridge, along the road on both sides, lush and tall trees are dotted with neat and oily green terraced fields. In the center of Crow Wind Ridge, wide streets, rows of milky white houses, staff dormitories, scientific research institutes, hospitals, department stores, post offices, banks, cultural centers..., form a mountain town.

　　Around the town, below the hillside, are buildings of forest factories, including sawmills, oil refineries, chemical plants, paper mills, wineries, etc., a total of more than 20, with chimneys emitting bursts of thick smoke, and the sound of machines is constantly ringing day and night. Now it is already a central industrial base of Damao Mountain.

　　Crow Wind Ridge, the revolutionary base area of the Red Army in those years, is becoming more and more beautiful, attracting more and more mountain builders. Recently, more than 2,000 young students and mountain people have come here to participate in the construction work.

　　The ninety-six down-to-earth cadres of Crow Wind Ridge have not only built the mountain area, but also exercised themselves. In their own words, "The mountain changes and people also change, the mountain is green and the heart is redder." In the past three years, twenty-six of them have gloriously joined the Communist Party of China, and fifty-eight have gloriously joined the Communist Youth League. At the same time, many people have become agricultural and industrial technical talents to build mountain areas. Jiang Bao'an, who was a cook when he first went up the mountain, is now the deputy director of the Scientific Research Institute.

    乌风岭上建新城
    茅群
    奇巍的乌风岭，拔海一千七百米，耸立在著名的革命老根据地大茅山中心。
    乌风岭，是座宝山。山上林木、茅竹取之不尽；山色景致，美不胜收。当年，方志敏烈士曾以此为据点，领导赣东北人民举起了革命红旗。那时，红军东进西出，群众来往频繁，该岭曾是一座繁荣的革命山镇。红军走后，这里遭到国民党反动派残酷洗劫，房屋烧光，田地荒芜，炊烟断绝。从此，乌风岭就被人称作“苦痛岭”了。
    1957年的冬天，江西省直属机关九十六名干部，热烈响应党的上山下乡劳动锻炼号召，来到了乌风岭。经过他们三年来的艰苦建设，今天的乌风岭再不是昔日的样子了，它披上了更美丽的新装，成了一座更繁荣的新山城。
    上山创业
    记得那是1957年的一个大雪纷飞的日子。
    乌风岭下，传来了当年《少共国际歌》的歌声：
    走上前去啊！曙光在前。
    同志们奋斗，用我们的刺刀和枪炮，
    开自己的路……
    歌声重新唤醒了沉寂荒凉的乌风岭。这是一支由江西省级机关、企业单位的九十六名下放干部组成的山区建设队伍，在中共江西省委书记、当年转战大茅山的老红军方志纯同志率领下，又走上乌风岭来了。人们扛着自己的行李工具，冒着暴风雨雪，踏着当年红军走过的脚印，以《少共国际》的战歌互相鼓舞着，披荆斩棘，爬上了乌风岭。他们决心在这里安家创业，把当年红军的革命根据地建设成为社会主义的新山区。
    他们一到山上，立即开始重建家业。开始几十个人挤在一间临时用芭茅、树枝搭成的茅棚里，睡在用茅草铺成的草铺上，一个人翻身整个草棚振动。晚上暴风掀破了屋顶，屋外下大雪，屋里落小雪。不多时，屋内冰雪变成雨水，大家的鞋子像小船一样飘了起来。但他们没有一个叫苦怕冷，大家毫不在意地从铺上爬起来，撑起雨伞挡住房子的破洞，并且面对面地唱起自编的山歌：乌风岭啊，红又红，我们的心啊像山红，不怕风吹和雨打啊，决心似钢建山城……。
    要安家，首先就得把房子盖起来！这是第一步。可是盖房子要砖瓦，他们寻遍了山上，都是一片白沙土，根本烧不成砖瓦。于是他们决定就地取材，用山上茅竹搭屋架，用山草和树皮编屋顶。然而在这险峻陡峭的山上，即使砍一根竹子，也并不那么容易，要攀悬崖绝壁，有时还要遭到野兽袭击。但大家异口同声地争着担当这艰巨的任务。最后党支部选拔了几十个年轻力壮的小伙子，由俞鹤龄担任队长，在风雪中出发了。突击队员们冒着迷漫的雪雾，攀上悬岩峭壁，一根一根、一捆一捆地砍运竹木，采运箬皮，常常一不小心，就从陡斜结冰的山坡上滑下几丈远。滑下去，就抓着树枝再爬上来，拍拍身上的泥雪，又重新投入战斗。就这样，他们经过辛勤劳动，自己扛材料，自己砌泥土，在荒山上盖起了第一批简单的新房，初步定居下来。
    当房子盖起时，已经入春，他们刚刚准备开荒生产，山上积雪汇成的山洪却冲断了他们运粮的道路。眼看口粮一天天减少，几十个人被困在山上。生产迫在眉睫，粮道又断绝，党支部研究这个情况，决定派共产党员蒋保安带领十几名党、团员突破洪水包围，渡水下山运粮。山下群众听说建设乌风岭的亲人们快要断绝粮食的消息，纷纷自动拿出自己的粮食借给他们，并推派了三个代表把粮食送上山来。山区人民的关怀和支援，给下放干部们又上了深刻难忘的一课，更加鼓舞了他们建设乌风岭的决心。党支部书记严振有握着送粮乡亲们的手说：我们一定要在乌风岭上创家立业，开花结果，要乌风岭交出更多的粮食，回报乡亲们的深情厚谊。
    开荒夺粮
    春耕开始了。初春的乌风岭，岩石上还挂着冰霜。
    “向山进军，向山要粮”这是党支部向全体同志发出的战斗号召。大家一个个生龙活虎般的投入了开荒战斗。山上多年荒芜的土地，生满了一人深的荆棘野草，堆满了石块瓦砾。干部们首先用火烧掉杂树野草，驱除山禽、蛇、兽。荒地里遍布树根、石头，犁头犁不动，他们就一锄一锄地挖，一下一下地砍。锄头落下去，撞到石头上，碰在树蔸上，震得虎口痛裂，膀臂酸痛。许多人手上磨起了血泡。许多人鞋子、衣服磨烂了。但他们仍然坚持战斗，每天早起晚归，一个劲地干，不停地开。但是开荒进度还是很慢。这时有些人就有些发急了，有的说：“再难的活也不怕，可就是这个锄头太慢了！”有的说：“这得要开到多久才能种上粮食呀！”
    在干部中最年轻的小赖，一天正在汗流浃背地拼命挖地，忽然“哗啦”一响，锄头下面像有一件什么东西。这时大家都围拢过来，用手在锄头下一掏，掏出两只脱了搪瓷的黑铁碗，拿起仔细看看，在碗底背面还隐约画着一只军用口哨。这是作什么用的呢？经当年在这里闹过革命的老红军战士的分析，大家才知道是当年红军打仗时带的茶碗。顿时，工地上一片欢腾，党支部书记激动地对大家说：“先一辈的老红军过去在岭上坚持革命，流血作战，不惜牺牲；今天我们在红军革命的地方搞建设，一定要继承老红军艰苦奋斗的革命传统，一锄一镐，也不要忘记红军的精神。我们开荒还没几天，有的人就发急了，这就不是红军的精神。”这时同志们一齐响亮地回答：“一定向老红军学习！一定继承红军的光荣传统！”于是开荒的速度加快了。大家一个决心，一个信念：不怕苦、不怕难，一定要荒地变良田！大家一面苦干，一面巧干，想办法，搞革新，开荒效率比原来提高了一倍。
    在下放干部的齐心协力艰苦经营下，仅仅凭着几十双手，半个多月，就在山上开出了七十多亩荒地，山上可以开垦的荒地几乎全部开垦出来了，并且及时施肥播种上了春播作物。
    就在当年秋后，这批下放干部开始实现了“一定要乌风岭长出更多的粮食”的志愿。乌风岭上获得了第一次丰收。种植的马铃薯、红薯、玉米等作物总产量，折合稻谷计算共达三万多斤。其中马铃薯、红薯单位面积产量高达八千多斤。又白又大的萝卜亩产三千多斤，一向被认为高山不能生长的西瓜，也长得有八斤多重。
    接着第二年、第三年，他们采取林粮混种的办法，又扩大了耕地面积三百多亩。今年粮食总产量已增加到十二万多斤，各种蔬菜总产量增加到十万多斤，做到了粮菜自给有余。
    向山取宝
    乌风岭上有万宝，
    全看干劲大和小；
    干劲越大宝越多，
    干劲越小宝越少。
    山上最多的是松林，除做用材之外，有大量松枝、松蔸被废弃。下放干部看到松树上凝结着许多油质，决定首先利用它提炼松油。可是他们没一个人学过炼油，手头也没有一点技术资料。他们就凭着一股干劲，一股敢于创造的精神，背着锅盆饭甑到山林里安营扎寨，就地研究，就地试验。王启圣、万淑惠几个人开始试用木甑蒸馏，卢春龙、吴明通几个人试用喷雾器煮熬，大家采用各种各样的办法，反复试验。最后共产党员卢春龙终于用瓦罐子炼出了大半碗浓缩的松油。这就进一步鼓舞了大家的劲头，结果提炼出了大量的松木原油。有了松木原油，他们想方设法又从原油中分馏出来了汽油、柴油、选矿油、润滑油等许多宝贵的工业用油。此外，还从松树身上制取出松香、松节油、松针油、栲胶、活性炭、石腊、酒精等三十多种林产化工原料。这样，仅松树一项，就取得了几十种“宝”。他们又利用竹子造纸，利用各种野果、野生植物造酒……。去年，他们在山上发现了一种含毒性很强的野生石蒜，用这种野生石蒜制取出了工业用的极为贵重的丙酮和丁醇。
    三年来他们向山取宝，利用山上的一草一木，白手起家，为国家创造了大量的林副产品和化工原料，为国家创造了价值一百三十七万元的财富。
    山城新貌
    乌风岭，在九十六名下放干部风浸雨浴的建设中，一幅新的面貌展现在人们面前，它已经成为了一座名副其实的新山城。
    干部上山时，到乌风岭几乎无路可走，现在已经修成了宽阔的盘山公路，汽车可直达山顶。登上乌风岭，沿着公路两旁，葱郁魁梧的树木，点缀着整齐油绿的梯田。在乌风岭的中心地，宽阔的街道，一排排乳白色的房子，职工宿舍、科学研究所、医院、百货商店、邮电局、银行、文化馆……，围成了一座山上城镇。
    在镇的四周，山坡下面，是一幢幢的林区工厂，包括制材厂、炼油厂、化工厂、造纸厂、造酒厂等，共二十多座，烟囱冒着阵阵浓烟，机器的鸣声日夜不停。现在这里已经是大茅山的一个中心工业基地了。
    乌风岭这座当年红军的革命根据地，正变得越来越美丽，吸引着越来越多的山区建设者。最近又有二千多青年学生和山区群众到这里来参加建设工作。
    乌风岭的九十六名下放干部既建设了山区，也锻炼了自己。用他们自己的话说是：“山变人也变，山绿心更红”了。三年来，他们之中，已经有二十六人光荣的参加中国共产党，有五十八人光荣的参加了共青团。同时，还有许多人成为建设山区的农业和工业的技术人材。刚上山时担任炊事员的蒋保安，现在已经是科学研究所的副主任。
