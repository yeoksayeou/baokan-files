Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 13th: According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao Fighting Units Radio Station tonight, Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, issued a statement today, pointing out that the so-called "government" announced in Savannakhet by the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak traitorous clique is a puppet government illegally established by U.S. imperialism and the Thai reactionaries, and is their tool for interfering in and invading Laos.

The statement said, "The Lao Patriotic Front has pointed out that the establishment of this puppet government is an important part of a dangerous conspiracy by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. At the same time, it is a new step in the U.S. imperialist and Thai reactionary clique's conspiracy of interference and aggression against Laos. In order to realize the above-mentioned conspiracy, they have coordinated actions in all aspects, such as concentrating their forces to attack Vientiane in order to occupy the seat of the central organs—the capital Vientiane—and overthrowing the only legitimate government of the Kingdom of Laos—the Souvanna Phouma government. At the same time, they launched riots in Luang Prabang in order to force the King to realize their intentions, and then created riots in Vientiane, in order to kidnap some members of parliament to Savannakhet. Finally, they used hypocritical so-called legal forms, decrees and votes of certain members of parliament to establish a puppet government. The above-mentioned hypocritical so-called legal forms can never conceal their dictatorial and traitorous nature."

The statement said, "Under the circumstances that some members of parliament were kidnapped to the headquarters of the traitorous clique, the resolutions of these members of parliament obviously cannot be regarded as the resolutions of the National Assembly." The statement also said, "The so-called decrees promulgated under the circumstances that the King was surrounded and subjected to pressure obviously do not have their original value. On this issue, Prince Phouma has wisely and correctly announced that 'The Kingdom Government hereby declares to the people of the world that the government does not recognize any decisions made by the King under military pressure.' Therefore, for the Lao constitution and the people, the Phouma government is the only legitimate government, because this government has been approved by the National Assembly and approved by the King, and has won the trust and support of the people of the whole country and the recognition of the governments and people of all countries in the world."

The statement said that, according to the constitution and the laws of the country, as well as the rights and aspirations of the people, the Lao Patriotic Front declares:

"The Lao Patriotic Front and the Lao people consistently recognize the government of Prince Souvanna Phouma as the legitimate government of the Kingdom of Laos, and resolutely unite around this government to make the policy of peace, neutrality and national harmony a reality."

"The Lao Patriotic Front and the Lao people solemnly declare to the people of the world that the newly established so-called government of the Boun Oum-Phoumi clique is a puppet government illegally established by U.S. imperialism and the Thai reactionaries, and is their tool for interfering in and invading Laos."

"The Lao Patriotic Front and the Lao people believe that all their activities are traitorous activities, and resolutely and strongly oppose them."

The statement said that, facing the new and serious development of the activities of U.S. imperialism and its reactionary running dogs, the Lao Patriotic Front calls on the people of the whole country to heighten their vigilance, resolutely unite, oppose the interference of U.S. imperialism and the Thai reactionaries, and defeat the traitorous activities of the Boun Oum-Phoumi clique.

The statement said, "The Lao Patriotic Front calls on the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference to pay close attention to the acts of U.S. imperialism and the Thai reactionaries in interfering in Laos, which is a serious violation of the Geneva Agreements."

The statement concluded, "The Lao Patriotic Front firmly believes that peace-loving countries and people in the world will condemn the extremely blatant and brutal interference of U.S. imperialism and the Thai reactionaries in Laos, and support the Lao people's struggle for peace, sovereignty and justice."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 14th: According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao Fighting Units Radio Station today: Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, in a call to the people of Vientiane and the troops defending Vientiane, warmly praised their heroic fighting spirit against the enemy and expressed his cordial greetings to them.

The call believes that even if the enemy is able to temporarily occupy the capital Vientiane, they will never be able to conquer the patriotic and united fighting spirit of the Lao people and troops. The call finally pointed out that the just struggle of the Lao people will surely be victorious.

    老挝爱国战线党主席苏发努冯发表声明
    富马政府是老挝唯一合法政府
    叛国集团非法成立的傀儡“政府”是美帝国主义的侵略工具
    新华社河内13日电　据寮国战斗部队电台今晚广播，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王今天发表声明，指出文翁·纳占巴塞—富米·诺萨万叛国集团在沙湾拿吉宣布成立的所谓“政府”是由美帝国主义和泰国反动派非法建立起来的傀儡政府，是它们干涉和侵略老挝的工具。
    声明说，“老挝爱国战线党曾经指出，这个傀儡政府的成立，是美帝国主义及其走狗危险的阴谋中的一个重要部分，同时，它是美帝国主义和泰国反动集团对老挝的干涉和侵略阴谋中的一个新的步骤。为了实现上述阴谋，它们已经从各方面配合行动，如集中力量进攻万象，以便占领中央机关的驻地——首都万象；推翻老挝王国唯一合法政府——梭发那·富马政府。同时，它们在琅勃拉邦发动暴乱，以便迫使国王实现它们的意图，接着又在万象制造暴乱，借以把一些议员劫持到沙湾拿吉。最后是利用虚伪的所谓合法形式、法令和某些议员的表决来成立傀儡政府。上述虚伪的所谓合法形式，决不能掩盖它们的独裁和叛国的本质。”
    声明说，“在一些议员被劫持到叛国集团总部的情况下，这些议员的决议显然不能算是国民议会的决议。”声明又说，“在国王被包围和被施加压力的情况下颁布的所谓法令，显然不具备它原有的价值，对于这个问题，富马亲王曾经明智和正确地宣布过，‘王国政府谨向全世界人民宣布，政府不承认国王在军事压力下所作出的任何决定’。因此，对于老挝宪法和人民来说，富马政府是唯一合法的政府，因为这个政府曾经获得国民议会通过和国王批准，获得全国人民的信任和拥护以及世界各国政府和人民的承认。”
    声明说，根据宪法和国家的法律以及人民的权利和愿望，老挝爱国战线党宣布：
    “老挝爱国战线党和老挝人民始终如一地承认梭发那·富马亲王政府是老挝王国的合法政府，并且坚决团结在这个政府的周围，使和平中立和民族和睦的政策变成现实。”
    “老挝爱国战线党和老挝人民向世界人民严正声明，刚成立的所谓文翁—富米集团的政府，是由美帝国主义和泰国反动派非法建立起来的傀儡政府，是它们干涉和侵略老挝的工具。”
    “老挝爱国战线党和老挝人民认为，他们的一切活动都是叛国的活动，并坚决地和强烈地加以反对。”
    声明说，面对美帝国主义及其反动走狗的活动新的严重的发展，老挝爱国战线党号召全国人民，提高警惕，坚决团结起来，反对美帝国主义和泰国反动派的干涉，击败文翁—富米集团的卖国活动。
    声明说，“老挝爱国战线党呼吁日内瓦会议两位主席密切注视美帝国主义和泰国反动派干涉老挝的行为，这是严重违反日内瓦协议。”
    声明最后说，“老挝爱国战线党坚信：世界上爱好和平的国家和人民将会谴责美帝国主义和泰国反动派对老挝的极其明目张胆的、粗暴的干涉，并支持老挝人民为和平、主权和正义的斗争。”
    据新华社河内14日电　据寮国战斗部队电台今天广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王在向万象人民和保卫万象的部队发出的号召书中，热烈赞扬了他们抗击敌人的英勇斗争精神，并向他们表示亲切的慰问。
    号召书认为，如果敌人一旦能够暂时占领首都万象，他们也决不能征服老挝人民和部队的这种爱国、团结斗争的精神。号召书最后指出，老挝人民的正义斗争一定会取得胜利。
