    A Discussion on the Creative Method of the Opera "Red Coral"
    Ye Lin
    The creation and performance of "Red Coral" by the Song and Dance Troupe of the Political Department of the Navy is a noteworthy event on the stage of opera art. This opera has many appealing aspects from content to form, and everywhere reveals a spirit of bold creation, which is very brilliant in art. It dares to creatively develop the expression form of opera on the basis of comprehensively and deeply learning from the tradition, and dares to carry out multi-faceted experiments to improve and enrich its artistic expression ability, touching on many issues of common concern to us. Among these issues, some are continued explorations on the basis of existing achievements, and some are blank spots that have not been touched or rarely touched in the past. Whether in the same or different aspects, it has carried out meaningful practice, raised questions, created experience, has achievements, has contributions, and brought many new factors to the art of opera.
    The outstanding achievement of this opera lies first in its clear theme and content of revolutionary realistic struggle life. It uses a legendary technique to write a story about the People's Liberation Army and the people liberating coastal islands in the stage of the Third Revolutionary Civil War facing victory, through tortuous and moving plots. The opera focuses on the story of a fisherman's family on Coral Island, a father and daughter, who resisted the persecution of feudal fishing tyrants and Chiang Kai-shek bandits together with the local fishermen before liberation. They suffered all kinds of torture and endured heavy sacrifices. Later, a reconnaissance staff officer of our People's Liberation Army came to the island for reconnaissance and timely organized the masses to fight against the reactionary rulers. Once the people have obtained the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, they will exert unparalleled strength. After severe struggles, they finally cooperated with the advance of the People's Liberation Army and victoriously completed the task of liberating the coastal islands. This theme has long-term educational significance for us and our descendants.
    The correct theme and revolutionary content require perfect, profound, and vivid artistic expression. The achievement of the opera "Red Coral" lies in the fact that it not only movingly reflects the real struggle life, but also creates artistic expression forms. In this regard, we can appreciate that the playwrights and performers have a clear intention. In this opera, they are determined to comprehensively and systematically use the excellent traditions of national opera to conduct more experiments for the development of the national form of opera art. It absorbs the artistic methods of national opera from the structure of the literary script, language, methods of portraying characters to the creation of music, the use of the orchestra, the director's treatment, the actors' singing, acting, recitative, and even stage art in a relatively detailed and serious manner, and develops and creates on this basis. This makes the entire performance more harmonious, more complete in form, and more unified in style. As a result, the entire opera shows a distinct artistic personality, has a deeper relationship with tradition, and can stand out in the field of new opera.
    On the road of development of new opera, the question of how to inherit tradition and learn from the West has often become the center of discussion, and often leads to the exploration of the basic problems of the development of new opera. This issue was once hotly discussed at the first National Opera Performance in 1952, and was seriously discussed again at the New Opera Symposium in 1957. There have been many disputes in the meantime, and there are different practices in artistic practice. Now it seems that this phenomenon is normal. New opera is currently in the process of creation and development. Its creative path is very broad, and diverse experiments and explorations should be encouraged. As long as the political direction is consistent and the requirements of the national form are clear, there can be different practices in the issue of inheritance and reference, in order to accumulate experience, compare with each other, and let the masses identify and choose. The practice of the opera "Red Coral" is just one of them, and it is by no means the only one. However, its achievement lies in proving with its own practice the inheritance relationship between new opera and national opera, proving that new opera and national opera should have a boundary on the one hand and cannot be confused, and on the other hand, they are not completely separated and mutually exclusive. It further proves with powerful facts that there is an infinite wealth of artistic experience in the ocean of national opera, emphasizing comprehensive, detailed, systematic, and in-depth learning, not encouraging passively imitating opera and making opera art exactly the same as opera, but encouraging serious learning from and referencing the experience of predecessors, studying all the factors and all aspects of this art wealth that has been tempered, dissolving, absorbing, and developing it, which will only bring benefits to the growth of opera art. At the same time, we should also admit that on the basis of comprehensively and systematically learning and carrying forward the excellent traditional opera heritage, we can also open up a feasible path for developing new opera from here, and become one of many practices. As long as it is not regarded as the only one, then you can try boldly. The practice of "Red Coral" has more connection with the traditional literature and art, especially the artistic methods of national opera; this practice has actually enriched and developed the expression forms of opera art and is worthy of encouragement.
    The relationship between "Red Coral" and the traditional artistic expression methods of national opera can be discussed from three aspects: literary script, music, and performance.
    The biggest characteristic of this opera's literary script lies in its refined language, the unique method of portraying characters, and the tortuous and moving dramatic plot. These points are precisely the strengths of China's national opera art methods, and at the same time happen to be the current weaknesses of new opera, and are what new opera particularly needs to learn from national opera.
    Artistic language is an important means to vividly reproduce reality, express thoughts, and shape characters. In opera art, language is generally expressed in two forms: lyrics and dialogue. However, in the field of opera, different types of opera have different treatments of language. Western grand opera emphasizes singing and organizes all the language into music, canceling dialogue. This is a practice and has formed the tradition of European opera art that is happily accepted by the European people. From the characteristics of the overall artistic expression methods of our national opera, they not only pay attention to the musical tune, rhythm, and vocal lines and vocal skills in singing, but their literary level, whether it is ideological content, lyrics or dialogue, is very important in many famous repertoires, and many excellent traditional operas of the Song and Yuan dynasties are the painstaking work of China's famous artists and have become an important part of China's traditional literary treasure house. Dialogue in opera also has an important position, and it has always been emphasized in performing arts, with the saying "a thousand pounds of recitative and four ounces of singing," which shows how important the language of dialogue is in opera art. In the creation of new opera, the issue of language has gradually received greater attention in recent years, especially with the appearance of "Liu Sanjie," the importance of language in opera is even more prominent. Although the dialogue in "Liu Sanjie" is slightly inferior to its lyrics, its mountain songs are truly pearls, and every word is a dagger, shaping a vivid image of a "singing immortal," which makes people feel refreshed. In the opera "Red Coral," the achievement of language is also relatively prominent. There are many moving aphorisms in the lyrics, such as the final song in the first scene:
    "Forcing the King of Hell to pay debts, money is faster than steel knives; fishing tyrants kill people without knives, splitting flesh and bones in two."
    For example, the fishermen's song at the opening of the fourth scene:
    "The sea water rises and falls, the fishermen have suffered for generations, the wind rolls the sun and moon out of the sea, the waves roll the clouds and the sky shake the boat, the big oar wears out the hands of children and grandchildren, and the broken net breaks the backs of grandparents..." are all good verses that are both rich in ideological power and image.
    The language in the drama must be related to the typical environment in the play and the typical character of the characters. It is an important factor in forming the character characteristics of the characters in the play. The lyrics and dialogue of "Red Coral" play an important role in this regard. It pays attention to the personalization of the language of the characters, especially in the use of dialogue, it is very outstanding. Often a few words can set off the character's personality very clearly. For example, the dialogue between the watchman Lao Deshun and the Baozhang Sun Fugui in the first scene:
      Sun Fugui: What's the movement of the night watch?
      Watchman: There's a little wind and grass moving, it's not a serious matter!
      Sun Fugui: What's the matter?
      Watchman: In the middle of the night, someone wanted to escape to the mainland, and was caught by the Baoding and beaten violently!
      Sun Fugui: I know that. What else?
      Watchman: Also... the children are crying from hunger, and the old woman is screaming from hunger; some people are burning incense on the mountain, some people are praying on the beach, some people are scolding God, and... it's not good to say...
      Sun Fugui: What?
      Watchman: Say... that Seventh Master sealed the boats and sealed the island, not allowing fishermen to go out to sea, be careful to be knifed!
      Sun Fugui: Who said that?
      Watchman: I didn't see it clearly.
      Sun Fugui: Old confused!
      Watchman: I'm a little old.
      Sun Fugui: Go down!
      Watchman: Yes. (Exit)
    This exchange is tight, the answers are quick, showing the watchman's wit, and the characters of both people are vividly displayed.
    For example, in the second scene "Chasing the Sea," the chant and dialogue between Shanmei and Sun Fugui:
      Shanmei: (Singing) The vast sea is like an arrow, the thief ship tears my thoughts apart. Looking back at Coral Island, the lights have been drowned by the waves...
      Sun Fugui: Don't look! What's the concern for a poor family? If I were you, I would stomp on Coral Island three times and never look back. Follow Commander Dou, be unrestrained for a lifetime, and have a romantic life. This is something that is hard to find even with a lantern...
      Shanmei: (Singing) The waves are rolling eastward, and the nineteen years of suffering are coming to an end!
      Sun Fugui: That's right! The hard days are over, the good days are beginning, and when the boat docks at Niu Tou, you can shake up!
    Two people, two personalities, two views, and two moods are in sharp contrast.
    From these dialogues, we can also see that it has the sense of rhythm and musicality of opera recitative, and has the characteristics and style of the traditional opera method of portraying characters through dialogue. It can be seen that the author has put a lot of effort into the art of recitative in national opera. This kind of dialogue writing is different from the dialogue in life. It is more refined, summarized, and more concentrated. It is also different from the dialogue in drama. It is more musical and rhythmic, and it is also more rhythmic. Of course, it is not completely equal to the poetic recitative of opera, and has new vocabulary that conforms to the character of modern people. It seems that it is more suitable for new opera, and can get rid of the feeling that the dialogue is too much like the language of drama, and make the form of opera more complete.
    In addition to fully emphasizing the role of language, the author of "Red Coral" also adopted the experience of traditional opera and traditional literature of concentrating on a major scene or a major event to shape a character. This technique is often used very skillfully in the excerpts of opera. Like the play "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet," it often only needs to pass through a small event, and in one scene it can magnify and portray the character's personality and inner activities like a magnifying glass. In "Red Coral," it can sometimes be felt that this technique is used. For example, the second scene "Chasing the Sea" seems to be focused on portraying the character of Shanmei. Shanmei completely stands in this scene, and the impression is particularly deep. Of course, her personality will continue to develop with the development of the contradictions in the following scenes, but due to the absorption of this traditional expression method, it is undoubtedly of great use for the shaping of Shanmei's image. This scene also achieved the same effect in portraying the Baozhang Sun Fugui. The worldview and personality characteristics of this negative character are well expressed. From these examples, it can be appreciated that it is very important to concentrate efforts to write a few heart-stirring scenes in an opera, and in one scene to concentrate efforts to write two or three people well, grasp some major scenes, and fully portray the character's personality and inner activities. In some of our operas, there are often too many characters, and sometimes the stage is full of people, but the strength is scattered, and it is not easy to write well. Often it is just a shadow, and the impression is not deep. There are not many characters in "Red Coral." Although there are some characters that have not been written well, such as the People's Liberation Army reconnaissance staff officer Wang Yonggang and Shanmei's lover Aqing, the other main characters are written with flesh and blood, and the negative characters are not simplified.
    "Red Coral" has a very tortuous and moving dramatic plot, which often rises to a climax, and will not make people relax from beginning to end. A strong plot means that it does not rely on lengthy dialogue, but shows the contradictions through the actions of the characters in the play; it does not solve the contradictions behind the scenes, but puts the contradictions one after another in front of the stage. Especially for dramatic works, the plot is the most important structural means. The script of "Red Coral" is relatively poor at the beginning and the end, and the first scene is relatively general. However, from the second scene "Chasing the Sea," the situation has greatly changed. The plot of Shanmei's escape from despair has grabbed the audience's emotions all at once. The third scene "Encounter on the Island" has an even more tortuous plot, pulling out the line of the People's Liberation Army, and also pulling out the line of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The contradictions between the masses, the People's Liberation Army, the fishing tyrants, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits are intricately intertwined, making the plot take a step forward in the sharp class struggle. The fourth scene "Returning to the Island" arranges a more dramatic plot. Shanmei and Staff Officer Wang are followed by Sun Baozhang as soon as they return home. Just as the audience is worried about them, Shanmei cleverly protects Staff Officer Wang and stands up. At this time, the audience begins to worry about Shanmei. At the critical moment, the old watchman more cleverly adopts the method of transplanting flowers and grafting trees, protects Shanmei, and deceives the enemy with their wit. Several twists and turns occurred in a few minutes, making the audience nervous and breathless for the safety of Shanmei and Staff Officer Wang. After that, in the sixth scene "Catching Gui" and the seventh scene "Trying Shanmei," the author arranged some dramatic plots that the audience could not predict in advance, tightly grasping the audience's emotions, and living and breathing with the fate of the characters in the play. There is no doubt that this attitude of paying attention to dramatic plots is in line with the requirements of dramatic works, and opera art should also pay attention to this feature. One of the important reasons why "Red Coral" is popular with the masses is precisely because it played the role of this dramatic element.
    Of course, the drama plot is not only referring to many events that are related to each other, contradictory, and developing in order, nor is it only describing the actions of the characters participating in the plot, but more importantly, it is to express the characters themselves, and to express the images, personalities, and personality development of the characters. That is to say, the plot must be arranged within the scope that can be achieved by the typical environment and the typical character of the characters, so that it can be reasonable. Leaving the specific environment and character personality of the time and place to pursue the plot will violate the truth of life, making the characters seem to have inconsistent personalities in action, and the persuasiveness is not strong. The tortuous plot of "Red Coral" basically meets such requirements. Like the plots mentioned earlier, they all logically occurred from the personalities of the characters involved in these events. The wit of the people certainly exceeds that of the reactionary lackeys. Shanmei and the old watchman's actions in the fourth scene are in line with their heroic and witty personalities, so they can be fascinating. It's just that if we can make higher demands on this play, there are also places that can be discussed. What is more unsatisfactory is the certain portrayal of Shanmei. Although the image of this character is very distinct and has many successes, in the first scene "Forcing Debt" and the seventh scene "Trying Shanmei," her actions and her consistent personality always feel inconsistent. In "Forcing Debt," in order to pay off debts and treat her father, she automatically agreed to sign a contract to rent herself to the enemy. Although there may be such customs as renting oneself in the local area, although Shanmei is actually preparing to commit suicide by jumping into the sea to resist the persecution of the old society, this resistance is after all a voluntary compromise in front of the enemy, and is carried out through the form of voluntary renting of oneself. This is to write her down for Shanmei, who will grow into a heroic figure in the future, and the time is in 1950. She seems to be inferior to Yang Bailao in "The White-Haired Girl." This old man, who has been devastated by the old society for a lifetime, did not automatically press his fingerprints on the document of selling his daughter even in the cannibalistic society twenty years ago. Shanmei's voluntary action of renting herself is not in harmony with her future personality, and it always feels that it should not happen to her. In the seventh scene "Trying Shanmei," in order to protect the old watchman from being beaten, Shanmei said many things in front of the enemy that she should not have said; although the enemy could not catch up with the person who sent the letter, it is doubtful to tell the enemy all this information. In the scene "Chasing the Sea," the section where Shanmei dresses up in front of the mirror before committing suicide by jumping into the sea also makes this character too old and the personality not unified and satisfactory.
    In writing the relationship between the enemy and ourselves, some plots seem to write the enemy too low for a while, and then write us too low for a while. Of course, the enemy is stupid, but if we do not write out their cunning and vicious side at the same time, it will be too easy to win, and it will not be able to show the greatness of the people's power. In some places, such as the scene "Catching Gui," let Sun Fugui hide in the most conspicuous cabin in the center of the stage, and Wang Staff Officer can actually lose his vigilance, without arranging sentries and inspecting the scene in advance, he and the masses decided on the action plan in front of the cabin, and Sun Fugui heard it all. This cannot convince the audience either. It would be better if these problems could be resolved more reasonably when arranging the plot.
    When talking about the achievements of "Red Coral," a full evaluation must be made of its musical part. The musical creation of this opera has made many contributions in the practice of national form. It is consciously connected with the expression methods of national opera music. Except for individual folk songs and fishermen's chants, it basically uses the opera music of the Henan region as the main material; in terms of musical dramatization, it adopts some opera music plate and eye development techniques; in the writing of arias, it pays special attention to the use of flexible decorative notes and trailing sounds with the characteristics of opera music, and according to the needs of the plot and the possibilities of the arias, it absorbs the harmony techniques of Gaoqiang music and other local opera music and develops chorus. In terms of orchestral accompaniment, it also absorbs the method of "supporting the tune and protecting the key" of opera accompaniment. In terms of instrument arrangement, on the one hand, it gives each main character a characteristic instrument, and on the other hand, it strengthens the concertante in the orchestration, and at the same time, it consistently uses the percussion music commonly used in opera. Because of this series of designs and experiments, the music of the entire opera has a strong national style, all aspects are relatively unified and coordinated, and the color is very good.
    Among them, I think what needs to be particularly emphasized is the achievement of the chorus part of this opera. Its creation and use of chorus are very characteristic, and it is a successful attempt at the nationalization of opera chorus art. Its creation is deeply inspired and influenced by the harmony techniques of Gaoqiang. The opera chorus is mainly used before and after the curtain, which is very helpful for portraying and setting off the typical environment and atmosphere in the drama. In addition, the lyrics are refined and moving, and the impression is very deep. This kind of chorus can guide the audience into the plot in front of the curtain, and can continue to deepen the drama in the audience's mind in the ideological aspect behind the curtain. For example, the singing after the dark transfer in the first scene and after the chasing sea in the second scene, and the fishermen's song before the opening of the fourth scene all have such effects. As for certain characteristic choruses in the curtain, such as the singing of prayers in front of the temple after the opening of the eighth scene "Going Down the Mountain," it is written very characteristically. The design of the voice part is very purposeful. In addition, the melody has very wonderful musical convergences and modes, which completely portray a quiet and religious feeling of prayer. In Shanmei's solo in the second scene, the chorus part uses the harmony technique of Gaoqiang, which is very helpful to the soloist. Due to these successful attempts to use chorus, a special and appropriate position of chorus is created, which constitutes the most colorful and original feature of the opera's music.
    The national style of the music of this opera is rich, and there are many successes in the portrayal of characters. For example, several relatively long solos in Shanmei's aria have beautiful and enthusiastic melodies, and the psychological portrayal is also very detailed. These are the basic aspects. At the same time, on the other hand, the music of this opera also inspires us to think about a question, that is, the relationship between musical image and musical style, which can also be said to be the relationship between the inheritance and innovation of musical tradition in a certain sense. The national style of music is certainly important, but it itself can only be a means rather than the purpose of artistic creation. The development of the national style of music must be combined with the task of shaping musical images that conform to the character characteristics of the characters and the ideological and spiritual state of the characters in a specific environment, with the purpose of creating musical images. That is to say, the new opera must be reformed according to the needs of creation when learning the traditional music of national opera, and traditional things cannot bind its hands and feet. On this issue, the music of "Red Coral" has unique successes, and there are also places that are not as ideal. For example, how to use Henan Opera music to shape the image of today's heroic characters is worth studying. It is certain that Henan Opera can be adapted to the needs of different times and different characters if it can be created and developed. Famous opera actors have rich experience in this regard. We can appreciate the personality of this lively and playful girl from the music in Chang Xiangyu's performance of "Hong Niang"; and the arias in "Hua Mulan" are full of high-pitched and cheerful feelings. These are all examples of developing arias starting from the characters and from the needs of the drama. Shanmei's arias in "Red Coral" are based on Henan Opera, but generally only pay attention to absorbing the beautiful side of Henan Opera tunes, and there are more downward trailing sounds. This kind of overly long trailing sound is generally only good at adapting to a more suppressed personality and weak feelings. Therefore, the image shaped by Shanmei's music cannot fully adapt to Shanmei's personality, and seems to have more enthusiasm and beauty, but lacks the heroic spirit of firmness. In the following scenes, facing the enemy's interrogation struggle, there are also some more powerful tones, but because the basic tone has not changed, it is felt that the character development of Shanmei's music is also insufficient. As for the task of shaping the musical image of the reconnaissance staff officer Wang Yonggang, it has not been well completed, and there are many similarities with Shanmei's music, lacking an independent and distinct heroic personality. From the overall musical effect of the opera, it is also more heavy, and less bright and full of struggle, so it always produces a feeling of depression. Of course, this is not the fault of traditional opera music, nor is it to say that we should not learn deeply from traditional opera music. On the contrary, this can only show that we have not learned enough, and we cannot fully grasp it, and sometimes we are even grasped by it. If we can integrate and apply it freely, and obey the requirements of character shaping, like some successful passages in the music of this opera, then we can be handy and write music that has both national style and musical personality.
    The director's treatment and the actors' performance of this opera have more achievements in inheriting the opera tradition and breaking through the tradition. The actors can absorb the traditional expression methods from the character's personality, but they do not make mechanical imitations, and there are fewer traces of artificiality. It looks more comfortable, and it seems both cordial and fresh. Characters such as Sun Fugui, Lao Gengfu, Shanmei, Xu Laoda, and Haiwang's wife are all very good.
    The achievements and problems involved in the creation and performance of this opera are far more than these. In general, due to the creative activities of the playwrights and performers, great achievements have been made, giving people profound inspiration. The road has already been opened, and it is hoped that the comrades of the Song and Dance Troupe of the Navy Political Department will continue to explore, summarize experience, and make greater contributions to further improving the ideological and artistic quality of the new opera!
    Editor's Note
    In recent years, China's literary and artistic creation has made many creations and explorations in the aspect of nationalization, and the achievements are very great. However, both the creation and the theoretical exploration need to be further strengthened. Here, we publish two articles by Comrade Ye Lin and Comrade Wang Zhenya on the nationalization of opera and musical chorus, and excerpt and publish Comrade Liang Bin's conversation with the reporter of "Literary and Art News" on the issue of nationalization of literary works, hoping that comrades in the literary and art circles will further express their opinions in this regard.

    歌剧《红珊瑚》创作方法的探讨
    叶林
    海军政治部文工团歌舞剧团的《红珊瑚》的创作和演出，在歌剧艺术的舞台上，是一件值得重视的事情。这部歌剧从内容到形式，都有许多吸引人的地方，到处流露出大胆创造的精神，在艺术上很有光彩。它敢于在全面而深入地学习传统的基础上创造性地发展歌剧的表现形式，敢于为了提高和丰富它的艺术表现能力而进行多方面的实验，接触到不少为我们所共同关心的问题。在这些问题当中，有一些是在已有成就的基础上继续探索的，有一些则是过去还没有或较少接触到的空白点。无论在彼此相同或不同的方面，它都进行了有意义的实践，提出了问题，创造了经验，有成绩，有建树，为歌剧艺术带来了许多新的因素。
    这部歌剧的突出成就，首先在于它具有明确的主题思想和革命现实斗争生活的内容。它以传奇的手法，通过曲折动人的情节，写出了第三次国内革命战争面临胜利的阶段中我人民解放军和人民群众一起解放沿海岛屿的一段故事。歌剧着重描写了珊瑚岛上一家渔民父女，在解放前夕和当地渔民一起反抗封建渔霸和蒋介石匪帮的迫害，他们受尽了折磨，忍受着沉重的牺牲。后来，由于我人民解放军的一位侦察参谋来到岛上侦察，及时组织了群众向反动统治者进行斗争。人民群众一旦取得了中国共产党的领导，就会发挥出无比的力量，他们经过了严重的斗争，最后终于配合了人民解放军的进军，胜利地完成了解放沿海岛屿的任务。这个主题无论是对我们或是对我们的后辈来说，都是有着长远的教育意义的。
    正确的主题思想和革命的内容，要求在艺术上得到完美、深刻而生动的表现。歌剧《红珊瑚》的成就，正在于它不仅动人地反映了现实斗争生活，而且也创造了艺术表现形式。在这方面，我们可以体会到，剧作者和演出者是有着明确的意图的。在这部歌剧中，他们决心比较全面和系统地运用民族戏曲的优秀传统，为发展歌剧艺术的民族形式进行更多的实验。它从文学剧本的结构、语言、刻划人物的方法到音乐的创作，乐队的使用，导演的处理，演员的唱、做、念白，以至舞台美术等，都比较细致认真地吸收了民族戏曲的艺术方法，并且在这基础上加以发展和创造。这就使得整个演出都比较谐和，在形式上比较完整，在风格上比较统一。使整部歌剧由此而显示出鲜明的艺术个性，和传统的关系比较深，在新歌剧的领域中能够独树一帜。
    在新歌剧的发展道路上，关于如何继承传统和借鉴西洋的问题，经常成为讨论的中心，并且往往导致为新歌剧发展基础问题的探讨。这个问题在1952年全国第一届戏曲会演时曾经有过热烈的讨论，1957年在新歌剧座谈会上又认真讨论了一次。这中间有过不少的争论，在艺术实践中也存在着不同的做法。现在看来，这种现象是正常的。新歌剧目前正在创造和发展过程之中，它的创作道路是很宽广的，应该鼓励作多种多样的实验和摸索。只要政治方向是一致的，民族形式的要求明确，在继承和借鉴的问题上，完全可以有不同的做法，以便积累经验，相互比较，让群众来鉴定和选择。歌剧《红珊瑚》的做法，只是其中的一种，决不是唯一的。但是，它的成就是在于用自己的实践证明了新歌剧和民族戏曲的继承关系，证明了新歌剧和民族戏曲一方面应该有一条界线，不能混为一谈，另一方面它们又不是截然分割，相互排斥的。它以有力的事实进一步证明，在民族戏曲的海洋中有着无限丰富的艺术经验，强调全面、细致和系统、深入地学习，并非鼓励消极地去模拟戏曲，把歌剧艺术搞得和戏曲一模一样，而是鼓励认真地学习和借鉴前人的经验，研究这种经过千锤百炼的艺术财富中的一切因素和一切方面，溶化、吸收和发展它，这对歌剧艺术的成长，只会带来好处。同时，我们还应该承认，在全面和系统地学习和发扬传统优秀戏曲遗产的基础上，也可以从这里开拓出一条发展新歌剧的可行的途径，成为许多种做法之中的一种。只要不把它看作是唯一的，那就可以大胆尝试。《红珊瑚》的做法，就和传统文艺特别是民族戏曲的艺术方法有着更多的连系；这种做法实际上已经丰富和发展了歌剧艺术的表现形式，是值得鼓励的。
    《红珊瑚》和民族戏曲传统艺术表现方法的关系，可以从文学剧本、音乐和演出三方面来谈。
    这部歌剧文学剧本的最大特征，是在于它具有洗炼的语言，刻划人物的独特的方法和曲折动人的戏剧性情节。这几点，正是我国民族戏曲艺术方法的长处，同时又恰好是新歌剧当前的弱点，是新歌剧特别需要向民族戏曲学习的地方。
    艺术上的语言，是形象地再现现实，表达思想，塑造人物的重要手段。在歌剧艺术中，语言一般表现为唱词和对白两种形式。但是，在歌剧这个领域内，不同类型的歌剧对语言的处理却是不同的。西洋的大歌剧强调了歌唱，把语言全部组织到音乐中去了，取消了对白。这是一种做法，并且形成了为欧洲人民乐于接受的欧洲歌剧艺术的传统。我们的民族戏曲从总的艺术表现手法的特征而论，它们不仅注意音乐上的腔调、板眼和唱法上的声线、腔口，而且，它们的文学水平，无论是思想内容，以至唱词或是对白，在不少有名的剧目中都是十分被重视的，不少宋元时代的传统优秀戏曲都是我国名艺术家的呕心力作，成为我国传统文学宝库中的重要组成部分。戏曲中的对白也有着重要的地位，而且在表演艺术上一直被强调，有“千斤念白四两唱”之说，可见对白的语言在戏曲艺术中是多么的重要。在新歌剧的创作中，语言的问题在近年来也逐步得到了更大的重视，特别是《刘三姐》的出现，语言在歌剧中的重要性是更加突出了。《刘三姐》的对白比起它的唱词来虽然稍有逊色，但它的山歌却真是粒粒珍珠，字字匕首，塑造了一位“歌仙”的鲜明形象，使人耳目为之一新。在歌剧《红珊瑚》中，语言的成就也是比较突出的。在唱词中有不少动人的警句，像第一场终曲：
    “强迫阎王债，钱比钢刀快；渔霸杀人不用刀，生劈骨肉两分开。”
    又如第四场开幕时的渔歌：
    海水涨潮又落潮，渔家世代受煎熬，风卷日月出大海，浪滚云天把船摇，大橹磨破儿孙手，破网拉断爷娘腰……。”都是既富有思想力量，又富有形象性的好诗句。
    戏剧中的语言，必须是和剧中的典型环境和人物的典型性格连系着的，它是构成剧中人物性格特征的重要因素。《红珊瑚》的唱词和对白，在这方面起了重要的作用。它在人物语言的个性化这一点上是被重视的，特别是在对白的运用上更是十分出色，常常是几句话就可以把人物的性格烘托得很鲜明。像第一场中更夫老德顺和保长孙富贵的一段对白：
      孙富贵：夜里打更有什么动静？
      更　夫：有点风吹草动，不是什么正经事！
      孙富贵：什么事？
      更　夫：三更半夜，有人想逃大陆，被保丁抓
                回，好一顿毒打！
      孙富贵：这我知道。还有什么？
      更　夫：还有……孩子饿得哭，老婆婆饿得叫；
              山上有人烧香，海滩上有人祷告，有
              人骂老天，还有……就不好说啦……
      孙富贵：什么？
      更　夫：说……说七爷封船封岛，不让渔民出
                海，小心挨刀！
      孙富贵：谁说的？
      更　夫：没看清。
      孙富贵：老糊涂！
      更　夫：是上了点岁数。
      孙富贵：下去！
      更　夫：是。（下）
    这一段对答，接的紧，答的快，显示出老更夫的机智，两个人的性格都活龙活现。
    又如第二场《纵海》中珊妹和孙富贵的唱白：
      珊　妹：（唱）茫茫大海船似箭，贼船把我的
                心思扯断。回头再望珊瑚岛，灯火早
                被浪涛淹……。
      孙富贵：别看啦！穷家破业有什么牵挂头！我
                要是你呀，冲着珊瑚岛猛跺三脚，永不
                回头。跟上窦司令，潇洒一生，风流一
                世，这是打着灯笼也难找的事。……
      珊　妹：（唱）浪涛滚滚向东流，十九年的苦
                难已到头！
      孙富贵：对！苦日子到头，好日子开头，船一
              靠牛头，你可就抖起来啦！……
    两个人，两种性格，两种观点，两种心情，对比得十分鲜明。
    从这些对白中，我们同时也可以看出它具有戏曲念白的节奏感和音乐感，具有传统戏曲中那种通过对白来刻划人物的方法的特点和风格。可见作者对民族戏曲的念白艺术是下了功夫的。这种对白的写法不同于生活中的对话，它更提炼、概括和更集中。它也不同于话剧的对话，比较更富于音乐性和韵律，也更富有节奏感。当然，它也并不完全等于戏曲的韵白，有着符合于现代人性格的新的语汇。看来它对新歌剧来说是更为合适的，可以摆脱对话过于像话剧语言的感觉，而使歌剧的形式更趋于完整。
    《红珊瑚》作者对剧中人物的刻划，除了充分重视语言的作用以外，也采取了传统戏曲和传统文学的那种集中在一个主要场面或一个主要事件来塑造一个人物的经验。这种手法在戏曲的折子戏中是经常被运用得十分巧妙的。像《拾玉镯》这样的戏，往往只须通过一个细小的事件，在一场戏之中就能够像放大镜似地把人物的性格和内心活动刻划得须眉毕现。在《红珊瑚》中，有时也可以感觉到是采用了这种手法，像第二场《纵海》，看来就是集中刻划珊妹这个人物的，珊妹在这一场戏中是完全站住了，而且给人的印象也特别深刻。当然，她的性格在以后的几场戏中还随着矛盾的开展而继续有所发展，但由于吸收了这种传统的表现方法，对珊妹形象的塑造，无疑有很大的用处。这一场戏对保长孙富贵的刻划，也收到了同样的效果，这个反面人物的世界观，性格的特征，都有很好的表现。从这些例子中，可以体会到，在一部歌剧中集中力量写好几场能够打动人心的戏，在一场戏中又集中力量写好一两个人，抓住一些主要场面，充分地刻划人物的性格和内心活动，这个经验是十分重要的。我们有些歌剧往往是人物太多，有时满台都是人，但是力量分散，不易写好，往往只是一个影子，印象不深。《红珊瑚》人物不多，虽然也有一些人物没有写好，如解放军侦察参谋王永刚和珊妹的爱人阿青，但其它的几个主要人物，都写得很有血肉，写反面人物也不简单化。
    《红珊瑚》具有十分曲折动人的戏剧性情节，往往是奇峰突起，从头到尾，不会使人松劲。情节性强，意味着不是靠冗长的对话，而是通过剧中人物的行动来展示矛盾；不是把矛盾放在后台来解决，而是把矛盾一个接一个地摆到舞台前面来，特别是对于戏剧作品来说，情节是一个最重要的结构手段。《红珊瑚》这个剧本在一头一尾写得比较差，第一场比较一般化。但是，从第二场《纵海》开始，情况就大为改观了，珊妹的绝处逢生的情节，把观众的情绪一下子就抓住了。第三场《岛遇》有着更为曲折的情节，把人民解放军这一条线拉出来了，把蒋介石匪帮这一条线也拉出来了。群众，人民解放军，渔霸，蒋匪四个方面的矛盾错综复杂地纠结在一起，使情节在尖锐的阶级斗争中向前跨了一步。第四场《返岛》安排了一个更富于戏剧性的情节，珊妹和王参谋刚返到家中就被孙保长跟踪盯上，正当观众为他们耽心的时候，珊妹巧妙地掩护了王参谋，挺身而出；这时，观众开始为珊妹耽心，正在千钧一发之际，老更夫又更为巧妙地采用了移花接木法，掩护了珊妹，用他们的机智骗过了敌人。在几分钟之内出现了几个转折，使观众为了珊妹与王参谋的安危而紧张得透不过气来。这以后，在第六场《擒贵》和第七场《审妹》中，作者都安排了一些使观众事前无法预测的戏剧性情节，把观众的情绪紧紧抓住，随着剧中人物的命运一同生活和一同呼吸。没有疑问，这种重视戏剧性情节的态度是符合戏剧作品的要求的，歌剧艺术同样应该重视这一特点。《红珊瑚》之所以受到群众的欢迎，其中的重要原因之一，正是因为它发挥了这一个戏剧要素的作用。
    当然，戏剧情节决不仅仅是指许多彼此联系着、矛盾着、顺序发展着的事件本身，也不只是在情节中描写人物参与的行动，更重要的是为了表现人物本身，表现人物的形象、性格和性格的发展。这就是说，情节必须按着典型环境和人物典型性格所可能做到的范围内来安排，才能够合情合理。离开了当时当地的具体环境和人物性格来追求情节，就会违反生活的真实，使人物在行动中显得性格不统一，说服力也就不强。《红珊瑚》的曲折情节基本上是符合这样的要求的，像前面谈到的那些情节，都是从参与这些事件的人物的性格中合乎逻辑地发生出来的，人民群众的机智当然超过反动狗腿子，珊妹和老更夫在第四场的行动都是符合他们的英雄、机智的性格的，所以才能够引人入胜。只是，如果可以对这个戏提出更高的要求的话，这里面也不是没有可以商榷的地方。比较不满足的是对珊妹的某些刻划。尽管这个人物的形象很鲜明，有很多成功之处，但在第一场《逼债》和第七场《审妹》中，她的行动和她的一贯的性格总感到不够一致。在《逼债》中，她为了给父亲还债治病，竟自动同意画押租身给敌人。虽然当地可能有租身这种风俗，虽然珊妹实际上是准备投海自杀来反抗旧社会的迫害，但是，这种反抗毕竟是在敌人面前自动同意妥协，通过自愿租身这种形式来进行的。这对于珊妹这个日后成长为英雄的人物，时间又发生在1950年，是把她写低了。她在这一点上似乎还不及《白毛女》中的杨白劳，这个给旧社会摧残了一辈子的老汉即便是在二十年前的吃人社会中也不是自动在卖女儿的文书上按手印的。珊妹这种自愿租身行动和她日后的性格显得不够调和，总觉得不应该发生在她身上。在第七场《审妹》中，珊妹为了保护老更夫不受毒打，竟在敌人面前说了许多不应该说的话；尽管敌人追赶不上送信的人了，但把这许多情况全部告诉敌人，这是值得怀疑的。在《纵海》一场，珊妹在跳海自杀前对镜梳妆一节，也显得这个人物过于旧，性格不够统一和令人满意。
    在写敌我斗争的关系上，有些情节似乎一阵子把敌人写得过低，一阵子又把我们写得过低。敌人当然是愚蠢的，但是，如果不同时写出他们的狡黠毒辣的一面，取胜过于容易，也就不能显示出人民力量的伟大。在一些地方，如《擒贵》一场，让孙富贵躲在舞台中央最触目的大船舱内，而王参谋竟然可以丧失警惕性，不事先布置岗哨和检查现场，就和群众在船舱面前决定行动计划，让孙富贵全部听了进去。这也不能说服观众。如果在安排情节时把这些问题解决得更为合情合理，那就好了。
    谈到《红珊瑚》的成就时，必须对它的音乐部分作出充分的评价。这部歌剧的音乐创作在民族形式的实践上是作出了不少贡献的。它有意识地和民族戏曲音乐的表现方法相衔接，除个别民歌、渔民号子外，基本上以河南地区的戏曲音乐为主要素材；在音乐戏剧化方面，采用了一些戏曲音乐板眼发展的手法；在唱腔写作上，特别注意运用了戏曲音乐中富有特色的灵活的装饰音和拖腔，并根据剧情的需要和唱腔的可能，吸收了高腔音乐及其它地方戏曲音乐的帮腔手法，发展了合唱。在乐队伴奏方面，它也吸收了戏曲伴奏的“托腔保调”的方法，在乐器编配上，一方面给主要角色一件特性乐器，另一方面在配器上加强协奏性，同时贯串使用了戏曲中习惯使用的打击乐。由于这一系列的设计和实验，就使得整部歌剧的音乐具有浓厚的民族风格，各方面都比较统一和协调，色彩很好。
    其中，我觉得需要特别强调的是这部歌剧的合唱部分的成就。它的合唱的创作和运用都非常有特点，是歌剧合唱艺术民族化的成功的尝试。它的创作受高腔的帮腔手法的启发和影响很深。歌剧的合唱主要用在幕间前后，对戏剧中的典型环境、气氛的刻划、衬托很有帮助，加上词句的精炼感人，印象非常深刻。这种合唱，放在幕前可以引导观众进入剧情，放在幕后又可以在观众的脑海中使戏剧继续在思想上深化。如第一场暗转后和第二场纵海后的歌声，第四场开幕前的渔歌，都有这样的效果。至于幕中的某些带有特性的合唱，如第八场《下山》开幕后的庙前祷告的歌声，写得很有特点，声部进行的设计是很有目的性的，加上曲调有很奇妙的乐汇和调式，完全刻划出一种宁静而带有宗教性质的祷告的感情。在第二场珊妹的独唱中，合唱部分则又使用了高腔的帮腔的手法，对独唱者很有帮助。由于这些成功的使用合唱的尝试，造成了合唱在这里面的特殊而又恰当的地位，构成了这部歌剧音乐的最具有色彩和独创性的特点。
    这部歌剧音乐的民族风格是浓郁的，对人物的刻划也有不少成功之处，如珊妹的唱腔中几段比较长的独唱，曲调优美、热情，心理刻划也很细致。这都是基本的方面。同时，在另一方面，这部歌剧的音乐也启发我们去思索一个问题，那就是音乐形象和音乐风格的关系问题，在某种意义上也可以说是音乐传统的继承与革新的关系问题。音乐的民族风格固然是重要的，但是，它本身毕竟只能够是一种手段而不是艺术创作的目的。发展音乐的民族风格必须和塑造符合人物性格特征与特定环境下的人物思想精神状态的音乐形象的任务结合起来，以创造音乐形象为目的。也就是说，新歌剧学习民族戏曲音乐传统必须根据创作的需要予以革新，不能让传统的东西束缚住自己的手足。在这个问题上，《红珊瑚》的音乐有独特的成功之处，也有不尽如理想的地方。比如：如何运用河南梆子音乐来塑造今天英雄人物的形象问题，就值得研究。肯定地说，河南梆子如果能够加以创造和发展，是能够适应不同时代，不同人物的需要的，有名的戏曲演员在这方面就有着丰富的经验。我们在常香玉演出的《红娘》中可以从音乐上体会到这个活泼、俏皮姑娘的性格；在《花木兰》的唱腔中却又富有高亢、开朗的感情。这都是从人物出发，从戏剧需要出发来发展唱腔的范例。《红珊瑚》中珊妹的唱腔是以河南梆子为基础的，但一般只是注意吸收了河南梆子腔调的秀丽优美的一面，下行的拖腔较多，而这种过长的拖腔一般只善于适应一种较为压抑的性格和软弱的感情，因此，珊妹音乐中所塑造的形象就不能完全适应珊妹的性格，显得热情婉丽有余，而刚毅英雄气概则不足。在后面的几场，面对着敌人的审讯斗争，也有一些较为有力的音调，但是，由于基本情调没有改变，因而感到珊妹音乐的性格发展也不足。至于侦察参谋王永刚的音乐形象塑造的任务，更是没有很好地完成，和珊妹音乐有不少相似之处，缺乏独立的鲜明的英雄个性。从整部歌剧的音乐效果听来，也是沉重的多，明朗而富于斗争性的少，因而总是产生一种压抑的感觉。当然，这并不是传统戏曲音乐的过错，更不是说不应该深入向传统戏曲音乐学习，相反地，这只能说明我们学习得还不够，还不能够充分掌握它，有时甚至被它掌握了自己。如果能够融会贯通，服从于人物塑造的要求，像这部歌剧音乐中的某些成功的段落那样，那就能够得心应手，写出既有民族风格又有音乐个性的音乐来。
    这部歌剧的导演处理和演员的表演，在继承戏曲传统而又突破传统的方面，有着较多的成就。演员们能够从角色的性格出发，吸收传统的表现手法，但又不作机械的模拟，人工的痕迹较少，看起来比较舒服，显得既亲切，又新鲜。像孙富贵，老更夫，珊妹，徐老大以及海旺妻等人物，都是很好的。
    这部歌剧在创作和演出上取得的成就和涉及到的问题，远不只这一些。总地说来，由于剧作者和演出者们的创造性的活动，已经取得了很大的成绩，给人以深刻的启发。路子已经闯开了，希望海政文工团歌舞剧团的同志们继续探索，总结经验，为进一步提高新歌剧的思想艺术质量而作出更大的贡献！
