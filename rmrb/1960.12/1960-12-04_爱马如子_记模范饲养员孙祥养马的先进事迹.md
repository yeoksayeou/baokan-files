    Treating Horses Like Children
    —On the Advanced Deeds of Model Horse Breeder Sun Xiang
    By Our Reporter
    Treading on the early winter snow, we arrived at the Fifth Production Team of the Sixth Management District of the Tuanjie People's Commune in Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province. Here, people and horses were bustling with activity, threshing and transporting grain. In the yard where grain piled up like mountains, we saw a group of strong and sturdy horses, some pulling large stone rollers to thresh soybeans, others pulling large carts, transporting the full loads of grain into the warehouse. Cong Yufeng, the Party Branch Secretary of the Management District, told us: "Here, one laborer is responsible for forty-one mu of cultivated land, and one horse is responsible for sixty-two mu. This year, each laborer can produce more than 12,000 jin of grain. Without enough strong animal power, cultivating so much land and threshing so much grain would be impossible." On the way back from the yard, we met a commune member in his forties, slowly walking a horse that had just unloaded grain. Cong Yufeng introduced us. This person was Sun Xiang, the model breeder we were going to interview. In the evening, sitting on the warm kang in the production team's canteen, people told us many stories about Sun Xiang's love for horses.
    Meticulous Feeding
    Sun Xiang's home is in this village, but few people see him go home. To take care of the horses, he moved to a house next to the stables. During the day, even if he is eating, when he sees the horses returning from work, he quickly puts down his bowl to take care of the animals; at night, he stays up all night patrolling around the horses, adding grass and feed, and watering them on time. He only sleeps after the horses have eaten their fill and gone to work the next morning. The commune members told us this story: This spring, on a snowy night, a newborn foal became ill and was dying. Sun Xiang did not hesitate to carry the foal back into the house and gently placed it on the warm kang where he slept. Thanks to his rescue, the foal was saved. On the third day after the foal was born, the mare also became ill, with sores in her nose, unable to eat anything, and the foal had no milk to drink. The commune members were worried about the lives of this "mother and child". Sun Xiang was even more anxious than the commune members, as he had to take care of the large group of animals and try his best to carefully treat these two horses. He got a few jin of millet, ground it into flour, mixed it into a batter, and fed it with a small spoon. He also used some soybeans, ground them into a thin porridge like making tofu, and fed the mare with a "feeding horn," five times a day, each time taking about an hour. At the same time, he washed the mare's nose with warm water every day and applied a medicinal herb to the sores to disinfect them. After more than half a month of careful care, the mare recovered, and the foal was saved. Now this yellow mare is pregnant again, and the foal has grown up. When we asked Sun Xiang why he loved horses so much, the commune members told us: In the old society, he worked as a hired hand for landlords for seventeen years, spending half his life around horses, but he didn't even own a single horsehair. He fattened the landlord's animals, but he himself became emaciated. Now he feeds horses for the people's commune, which is also feeding himself. The better the horses are fed, the more energetic they are to work, the more grain they produce, which supports the country and makes his own life better. How could he not work hard?
    Chop Every Inch of Grass Three Times
    Sun Xiang has standards for the grass commune members chop to feed the horses: every inch of grass must be chopped three times. If anyone chops it too long, he will unceremoniously ask them to redo it. We went to the shed and saw that the grass was indeed chopped very finely. Sun Xiang told us: "If the grass is chopped finely, the grass nodes will be opened, the feed will be evenly mixed, the horses will love to eat it, and it will be easy to digest. Even without adding feed, the animals can eat 80% full." We asked: "Is it only with good grass and feed that you can feed horses well?" He did not answer this question directly, but said: "If you don't have love for the collective, even if you bury the horse in feed, it will still be skinny!"
    From his long-term feeding work, Sun Xiang has developed a set of horse-feeding experience: feed the horses only 80% full at night, and then feed them fully two hours before work the next day. At this time, the horses love to eat grass the most and can quickly eat their fill. Of course, they are energetic when they go to work.
    "To prolong the lives of old horses, to rejuvenate old horses," this is Sun Xiang's ambition. Among the thirty horses raised by Sun Xiang, six are over twenty years old, one of which is thirty-seven years old. These old horses fed by Sun Xiang can do everything: pulling carts, plowing, pushing rollers, and grinding. How does Sun Xiang rejuvenate these old horses? He raises the six horses over twenty years old in single stalls, and according to the characteristics of the old horses' poor teeth and slow eating, he always gives them more soft grass and soft feed than ordinary horses each time, feeding them about an hour longer. In the summer when the green grass is lush, he often leads several old horses to graze in the meadows, and sometimes leads them out for a stroll at night. In the winter, he uses pieces of burlap to cover their backs. In this way, these old horses are all strong and energetic, maintaining "full attendance" since the spring plowing.
    Combining Work and Rest
    In his long-term horse-raising practice, Sun Xiang has accumulated rich experience in feeding and using horses. He can not only meet their needs for food and drink based on the horses' movements and expressions, but also knows the temperament and habits of each horse like the back of his hand. He knows exactly which horse is suitable for pushing rollers and grinding, which horse is suitable for plowing, and which horse is suitable for long-distance pulling. In this way, he can suggest that the production team arrange work appropriately according to the different characteristics of the horses. For example, there is a small black horse that is suitable for pulling carts, but its legs are too fast. Regardless of whether it is lightly or heavily loaded, uphill or downhill, it pulls desperately. It is also harnessed as an outside horse, and the carter's whip is accustomed to shaking over the head of the outside horse, which often puts it in a state of tension, often getting covered in sweat and too tired. After Sun Xiang discovered this situation, he immediately suggested that the carter switch the small horse from the outside to the inside.
    Pulling rollers and grinding is not easy work. The horses that pull the rollers and grind need to be rotated and rested frequently. Sun Xiang grasps this very accurately. Whenever the carter does not pay attention to the horses' rest, he always takes the initiative to lead the horses to change shifts.
    During the summer weeding season, the weather is hot, and the work is intense. In addition to taking extra care, Sun Xiang often runs to the fields to check the horses' usage, helping the carters repair the ropes neatly and wipe the ploughshares shiny. He often earnestly tells the young carters: "People still wipe the hoe when hoeing, if you wipe the ploughshare bright, won't the animals pull it easier?" (Attached picture)

    爱马如子
    ——记模范饲养员孙祥养马的先进事迹
    本报记者
    踏着初冬的积雪，我们来到了黑龙江省绥化县团结人民公社第六管理区第五生产队。这里人马欢跃，正在打场、运粮。在粮食堆积如山的场院里，我们看到了一群膘肥体壮的马，有的拉着大石磙子脱粒黄豆，有的拉着大车，把装得满满的粮食运送入库。管理区党支部书记丛玉峰告诉我们说：“在我们这里，一个劳动力负担四十一亩耕地，一匹马担负六十二亩，今年每个劳动力能生产一万二千多斤粮食。要是没有足够的强壮畜力，种这么多地，打这么多粮食，说啥也办不到的。”在从场院回来的路上，我们遇见了一位四十多岁的社员，正在牵着一匹送粮回来刚卸车的牲口，慢慢的蹓着。丛玉峰给我们作了介绍。这个人就是我们要访问的模范饲养员孙祥。晚上，坐在生产队食堂里烧得暖烘烘的火炕上，人们对我们讲了许多关于孙祥爱马的故事。
    精心饲养
    孙祥的家就住在本屯子里，可是很少有人见到他回家，为了照顾马匹，他搬到马圈旁边一座房子里住。白天，那怕是他正在吃饭，看到马干活回来，他就赶忙搁下饭碗去照料牲口；晚上，他彻夜不眠巡回在马身旁，添草加料，按时喂饮。直到第二天早晨马吃饱出工以后，他才睡觉。社员们给我们讲了这样一件事情：今年春天，一个风雪交加的夜晚，一匹新生下来的小马有了病，奄奄一息。孙祥毫不犹豫地把小马抱回屋里，轻轻地放在自己睡的热炕头上。由于他的抢救，小马得了救。在小马生下来的第三天，母马又病了，鼻子生了疮，吃不进东西，小马没奶吃。社员们都在为这“母子”的生命耽心。孙祥比社员们更着急，他既要照应大群牲口，又要想尽办法细心地医治这两匹马。他弄来几斤小米，磨成面，调成面糊，用小勺喂。他又用一些黄豆，像磨豆腐一样磨成稀粥，用“灌角”喂母马，一天喂五次，每次要喂一个小时左右。同时他每天还用温水给母马洗鼻子，用一种药草贴在疮上消毒。就这样经过他半个多月的精心护理，母马的病好了，小马也得救了。现在这匹黄骒马又怀了驹，小马也长大了。当我们问到孙祥为什么这样爱马时，社员们告诉我们：在旧社会他给地主扛过十七年大活，在马跟前转了半辈子，但自己连一根马毛都没有，把地主的牲口喂胖了，他自己却饿瘦了。现在他给人民公社喂马，也是给自己喂。马喂得好、干活有劲，多打粮，支援了国家，自己生活也更好了。他怎能不好好干呢？
    寸草铡三刀
    社员们铡喂马的草，孙祥定有规格：寸草要铡三刀。如果有谁铡的长了，他就毫不客气地叫他返工。我们特意到草棚子里，看到草铡的果然很细。孙祥告诉我们：草铡的细，草节都铡开了，拌料就均匀，马爱吃，容易消化，就是不加料，牲口也能吃个八分饱。我们问：是不是有了好草好料，才能喂好马？他没有直接回答这个问题，却说：要是没有爱社思想，就是用料把马埋上，也是喂个瘦骨伶仃！
    孙祥从长期饲养工作中，摸索出一套喂马经验：夜间喂马，只喂个八分饱，等到第二天出工之前两小时，再把马喂饱，这时马最爱吃草，很快就能吃饱。吃饱了去干活当然个个项硬。
    “叫老马延寿，叫老马复壮”，这是孙祥的雄心大志。孙祥饲养的三十匹马当中，二十岁以上的老马有六匹，其中有一匹已经三十七岁了。孙祥喂的这些老马驾辕、拉犁、推碾、拉磨，样样都行。孙祥是怎样使这些老马复壮的呢？他将六匹二十岁以上的老马进行单槽饲养，根据老马牙口不好、吃草慢的特点，在每次喂马时，总是特意多给一些软草软料，比一般的马多喂一个小时左右。夏天青草茂盛的时期，他经常把几匹老马牵到甸子里放牧，有时还在晚上牵着蹓，到冬天，就用一些麻袋片子之类的东西遮在马背上。就这样，这些老马个个老当益壮，从春耕以来一直保持“满勤”。
    劳逸结合
    孙祥在长期的养马实践中积累了丰富的饲养和使役的经验，他不仅能根据马的动作和神态来满足它们的饥食渴饮的要求，而且对每匹马的脾气和习性也了如指掌。那匹马适合推碾拉磨，那匹马适合拉犁种地，那匹马适合远途拉车，他都一清二楚。这样他就能根据马匹的不同特点，建议生产队适当安排活计。如有匹小黑马，适于拉车，但是腿脚过急，不管轻载重载、上坡下坡、它都拼命的拉。它又被套在外套，使役员的鞭子又习惯在外套马的头上晃动，这样就使它经常处于紧张状态，往往弄得浑身是汗，过于疲劳。孙祥发现这种情况以后，立即建议使役员把小马由外套换到里套。
    拉碾拉磨，活计不轻。担任拉碾拉磨的马匹需要经常轮换休息。孙祥对此掌握得很准确，每当使役员不注意马匹休息的时候，他总是主动的牵着马去换班。
    夏天趟地的时候，天气炎热，活计紧张，孙祥除了加倍精心保养以外，还经常跑到地里去检查马匹的使役情况，帮助使役员把绳套修理得整整齐齐，把犁铧擦得闪闪发亮。他时常谆谆的叮嘱年轻的使役员们说：“人锄地还要擦锄板呢，你把犁铧擦亮了，牲口拉起来不也省些劲吗？”（附图片）
