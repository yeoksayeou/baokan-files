    Revolutionary Elder Yang Qingju

    In a simple farmhouse in the Joint Production Team of the Shuigou Brigade, Jiangbei Commune, Xingguo County, Jiangxi Province, lives a revolutionary cadre family member who is deeply loved and respected by the people – Yang Qingju, the over seventy-year-old father of Yang Shangkui, the First Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee.
    Elder Yang Qingju has always been wholeheartedly loyal to the people's revolutionary cause. During the period of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, he tried every possible means to cover Yang Shangkui and underground Party comrades in their secret revolutionary activities. After liberation, when Yang Shangkui returned to work in the province, Elder Yang Qingju continued to work diligently in his hometown, using his concrete actions of loving the countryside, loving agricultural labor, and loving the socialist collective cause to lead the villagers in jointly building a beautiful and happy socialist home.
    Yang Qingju used to be a poor peasant. During the land revolution, he resolutely participated in the revolutionary struggle led by the Party, supporting and encouraging his son to dedicate himself to the revolution. After the Red Army went north to resist Japan, the Kuomintang reactionaries made a comeback, and he and all the people in the old revolutionary base areas were once again plunged into the abyss of suffering under white terror.
    In the autumn of 1949, Xingguo was liberated. Yang Qingju and his younger brother Yang Guangju said, "We have been looking forward to this day for more than ten years. The wishes of the people in the old revolutionary base areas can now be realized." Elder Yang Qingju, full of ambition to fully develop agricultural production and build his hometown, insisted on staying in the countryside and often did some light farm work. Everyone respected and loved him very much. Some people advised him, "You are so old, you have worked hard all your life, and you have suffered all your life. Now you can go to the provincial capital with your son and don't have to work hard in the countryside anymore." The old man listened and said quickly, "No! No! Chairman Mao said that agriculture is important and food is important. There are many people from our old Soviet area working outside! If you also go to your son's place, and she also goes to her relatives' place, who will farm the land? Who will build the hometown? In my opinion, the family members of our revolutionary cadres should take the lead in doing a good job in production and building our hometown to make achievements, so as not to be unworthy of the glorious title of revolutionary cadre family members."
    Elder Yang Qingju cares more about collective affairs than his own family affairs. This spring, the weather was a bit strange, and the spring plowing season arrived, but it was still cold. Based on his many years of production experience, Elder Yang Qingju was worried that the rice seedlings would easily rot this year. He thought: Spring is important, and good seedlings are half the harvest. Sowing and cultivating seedlings is a major event! He couldn't rest assured about this matter. When the team was making rice paddies, he carried a manure-collecting basket, walked around here, looked around there, and told people everywhere: the rice paddies should be made flat, the fertilizer should be sufficient, and sewage should not be allowed to flow into the rice paddies... He always wanted to see the rice paddies made up to standard before leaving with peace of mind. When sowing, he ran to the edge of the rice paddies again. When he saw someone sowing improperly, he would correct them at any time, and sometimes he would excitedly start to teach them how to sow. Thanks to the old man's day and night concern and everyone's joint efforts, although there were several cold waves this spring, the rice seedlings here have been growing well and are generally strong and uniform. At harvest time, the old man was worried about scattering rice grains, so he repeatedly urged the commune members to harvest carefully and thresh meticulously. All the team members were educated, and everyone paid attention to harvesting carefully and threshing meticulously, which greatly increased the harvest.
    Elder Yang Qingju's care for public property is also meticulous. During this summer sowing season, there was a drought and a shortage of water, and the team's waterwheels were moved to the river to pump water. When the commune members were eating lunch, Elder Yang Qingju was afraid that the waterwheel boards would be damaged by the sun, so he quietly took a few handfuls of straw and rushed to the river to cover the waterwheels one by one. The old man has done such things countless times.
    Elder Yang Qingju has been doing these things year after year out of his own consciousness. He neither wants others to praise him, nor is he trying to earn work points. He said that doing these things is just fulfilling his duty as a commune member.
    Elder Yang Qingju has been working hard for many years, and his whole family is also very diligent. Their lives have always maintained the simple style of the past. He always said: "Revolutionary cadre family members should not only play an exemplary leading role in diligent production and love for the collective, but also play an exemplary leading role in thrift and family management and lifestyle."
    Elder Yang Qingju usually saves money on household expenses, and any extra money is saved. However, if the team temporarily lacks some money to buy some farm tools, he always takes out some of his savings without hesitation and lends it to the team. He said, "It's right to use money to develop production!" (Attached picture)

    革命老人杨庆居

    在江西兴国县江背公社水沟大队联合生产队的一栋简陋的农舍里，住着一户深受人们爱戴与尊崇的革命干部家属——江西省委第一书记杨尚奎同志的父亲、七十多岁的老人杨庆居。
    杨庆居老人，对人民革命事业一贯忠心耿耿。在国民党反动统治时期，他曾经千方百计地掩护杨尚奎同志和党的地下工作同志进行秘密的革命活动。解放后，杨尚奎同志重返本省工作，杨庆居老人仍然坚持在自己的家乡勤劳生产，以他热爱农村、热爱农业劳动、热爱社会主义集体事业的具体行动，带动着乡亲们共同努力建设美好幸福的社会主义家园。
    杨庆居过去是个贫苦农民，在土地革命时期，他坚决参加了党所领导的革命斗争，支持和鼓励他的儿子献身革命。红军北上抗日后，国民党反动派卷土重来，他和所有老区的人民又陷于白色恐怖统治下的水深火热的生活中。
    1949年秋天，兴国解放了。杨庆居和他的弟弟杨广居说：“我们盼望了十几年，终于盼到了今天。老区人民的愿望，现在可以实现了。”杨庆居老人满怀着全力发展农业生产、建设家乡的雄心壮志，坚持留居在农村，并且经常作一些轻微的农活。大家对他非常尊敬和爱戴，有些人劝他说：“你年纪这么老了，过去受了一辈子劳累，吃了一辈子苦，现在可以随儿子到省城去住，不必再在农村里受劳累了。”老人听了，连忙说：“不能！不能！毛主席说过，农业重要，粮食重要。我们老苏区在外面做工作的人多着哩！如果你也去儿子那里，她也去亲戚那里，谁来种田呢？谁来建设家乡呢？照我看，我们革命干部的家属，更应该在家带头搞好生产，建设家乡，作出成绩来，才不愧革命干部家属这个光荣的称号。”
    杨庆居老人对集体事情的关心比对自己家里事还要操心得多。今年春天，天气有些古怪，春耕季节到了还是寒气袭人。杨庆居老人凭着他多年生产的经验，耽心今年容易烂秧。他想：一年阳春，秧好一半禾，播种育秧是个大事啊！这事叫他怎么也放心不下。队里做秧田时，他就提着个捡粪筐，这里走走，那里看看，到处对人讲：秧田要做得平，肥料要下得足，污水不能让流进秧田里……。他总是要一直看到秧田做得合乎标准，才放心地离开。播种时，他又跑到秧田边来，看到有人播得不得法，他也随时加以指正，有时兴冲冲地动起手来，教给人家怎样播。由于老人日夜操心，大家共同努力，今年春天虽然有几次寒潮侵袭，这里的秧苗却一直生长良好，普遍长得粗壮、均匀。收割时，老人耽心抛撒稻谷，又一再叮嘱社员们要精收细打。全队社员人人都受到了教育，个个都注意了精收细打，大大提高了收获量。
    杨庆居老人对公共财物的爱护也是无微不至。今年夏种时，天干缺水，队里的水车都搬到河边车水去了。社员们吃中饭时，杨庆居老人怕水车车板被太阳晒坏，就一声不响，独自一人提着几把稻草赶到河边去，把水车一一遮盖好。类似这样的事，老人不知做过多少次了。
    杨庆居老人长年累月揽这些事管，都是出自他自己的自觉，他既不图别人夸好，更不是为了挣工分。他说他做这些只不过是尽自己作一个社员的义务。
    杨庆居老人成年勤劳生产，全家人也都非常勤奋，他们的生活一直保持着当年的俭朴作风。他总是说：“革命干部家属，不但在勤劳生产、热爱集体上要起模范带头作用，而且在勤俭持家、生活作风上也要起模范带头作用。”
    杨庆居老人平常在持家上是这样省吃俭用，有一点点余钱都要储蓄起来。可是，队里要是临时短缺点钱添置个什么农具，他却总是毫不犹豫地就把自己积蓄的一些钱掏出来借给队里使用。他说：“把钱用在发展生产上，这是正用啊！”（附图片）
