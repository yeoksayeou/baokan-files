Your Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Distinguished Guests from Cambodia, Friends, Comrades:

    We are here with boundless joy to hold a banquet in honor of the distinguished guests from our friendly neighbor, the Kingdom of Cambodia. Please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese government, and in my own name, to once again extend a sincere and warm welcome to our people's respected friend, His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk, to His Excellency Penn Nouth, His Excellency Prime Minister Phoumi Nosavan, His Excellency ?·刁隆 Deputy Prime Minister, and to all the distinguished Cambodian guests who have come to our country with His Royal Highness, and through you, to pay our respects to the fraternal Cambodian people.

    Your Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk is visiting our country for the third time. We are pleased to see that each visit by Your Royal Highness has brought new progress in the friendly relations between our two countries, and has left our people with beautiful and unforgettable impressions. Your Royal Highness, your first visit promoted mutual understanding and mutual trust between our two countries. When you came to our country for the second time, our two countries had already established formal diplomatic relations. This time, you have brought us the very precious friendship of the Cambodian people. Accompanying Your Royal Highness on this visit to our country are so many important senior officials of the Kingdom of Cambodia, which is a rare event in the history of our two countries' relations. There is no doubt that this is another major development in the friendly relations between our two countries.

    The people of China and Cambodia have a long-standing traditional friendship. Our two countries have always lived in harmony and have never had any disputes, which is particularly worth cherishing. This traditional friendship between our two peoples has broader prospects for development after our two countries gained independence. Our two countries have the common experience of suffering from colonialism for a long time, have the common desire to develop independent national economies, and have the common task of opposing colonialism and striving for world peace. Our two countries both abide by the Five Principles for Peaceful Coexistence and have made sincere and unremitting efforts to strengthen the friendship between the two peoples. In recent years, the friendly exchanges and mutual assistance and cooperation in the economic and cultural fields between our two governments and peoples have developed rapidly. The mutual support between our two countries in international affairs has also become stronger day by day. Your Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk and the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia have always adhered to a policy of friendship towards China and have taken a solemn stand on matters concerning our country's national sovereignty and international rights and interests. Facts have proved that this relationship of mutual trust, mutual respect, and friendly cooperation between our two countries is closer than at any time in history. Your Royal Highness, please believe that the Chinese people are the most loyal friends of the Cambodian people, whether in our respective endeavors to safeguard our national independence or in the common cause of defending world peace. We are willing to cooperate closely with the Cambodian people and be friends forever.

    The Chinese people have always admired the firm stance taken by Your Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk and the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia in implementing a policy of peace and neutrality. Thanks to Your Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk's outstanding activities and contributions in safeguarding national independence and maintaining the cause of peace in Asia and the world, the international status of the Kingdom of Cambodia is rising day by day, the role of the Kingdom of Cambodia in international affairs is constantly strengthening, and Cambodia's independent and autonomous foreign policy is receiving increasingly wider support and praise. Your Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk's visits to Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia, three socialist countries, one after another, and the universal and warm welcome he received, are the most vivid examples. This also shows that any country, no matter how big or small, as long as its policy is correct and its stance is just, it will have a positive impact on its country and the surrounding world, and it will be able to generate tremendous power. The Kingdom of Cambodia has such a leader and such a hardworking and brave people, so it is strong and invincible. We believe that the Cambodian people, under the leadership of Your Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk, will surely be able to crush any foreign aggression and subversion conspiracies, lead their country onto the road of prosperity and strength, and continue to make new and greater contributions to the cause

    在欢迎西哈努克亲王宴会上
    刘少奇主席的讲话尊敬的诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王殿下，尊敬的柬埔寨贵宾们，朋友们，同志们：
    我们以无限喜悦的心情在这里举行宴会，款待来自我国友好邻邦——柬埔寨王国的高贵客人们。请允许我代表中国人民和中国政府，并且以我个人的名义，再一次向我国人民尊敬的朋友西哈努克亲王殿下，向随同亲王殿下前来我国的宾努阁下、福·波伦首相阁下、?·刁隆副首相阁下和柬埔寨全体贵宾们，表示真诚、热烈的欢迎，并且通过你们向亲戚般的柬埔寨人民致敬。
    西哈努克亲王殿下是第三次光临我国。我们高兴地看到，亲王殿下的每一次访问，都使我们两国的友好关系得到新的进展，都给我国人民留下了美好而难忘的印象。尊敬的亲王殿下，你的第一次访问，促进了我们两国的相互了解和相互信任。当你第二次来到我国的时候，我们两国已经建立了正式的外交关系。这一次，你又给我们带来了柬埔寨人民的非常宝贵的友谊。随同亲王殿下访问我国的，还有柬埔寨王国这样多的重要高级官员，这在我们两国关系史上是少有的盛举。毫无疑问，这在我们两国的友好关系上又是一个重大的发展。
    中柬两国人民之间有着历史悠久的传统友谊。我们两国一向和睦相处，从来没有发生过争端，这是特别值得我们珍视的。我们两国人民的这种传统友谊，在两国各自获得独立以后，有了更加广阔的发展前途。我们两国都有长期遭受殖民主义祸害的共同经历，都有发展独立的民族经济的共同要求，都有反对殖民主义和争取世界和平的共同任务。我们两国都信守和平共处五项原则，为加强两国人民的友谊作出了真诚不懈的努力。几年来，我们两国政府和人民之间的友好往来和经济文化方面的互助合作，都有了迅速的发展。我们两国在国际事务中的互相支持也一天比一天加强。西哈努克亲王殿下和柬埔寨王国政府一向坚持对中国友好的政策，并且在有关我国的国家主权和国际权益方面采取了严正的立场。事实证明，我们两国之间的这种彼此信任、相互尊重、友好合作的关系比起历史上任何时期都更加密切。尊敬的亲王殿下，请你相信，中国人民不论在我们各自维护自己的民族独立事业中或是在保卫世界和平的共同事业中，都是柬埔寨人民的最忠诚的朋友。我们愿意同柬埔寨人民亲密合作，永远友好。
    中国人民对于西哈努克亲王殿下和柬埔寨王国政府在执行和平中立政策中所采取的坚定立场，一向十分敬佩。由于西哈努克亲王殿下在捍卫民族独立、维护亚洲和世界和平事业中的卓越活动和贡献，柬埔寨王国的国际地位正在日益提高，柬埔寨王国在国际事务中的作用正在不断加强，柬埔寨独立自主的外交政策正在受到越来越广泛的支持和赞扬。西哈努克亲王殿下这次先后访问了捷克斯洛伐克、苏联和蒙古三个社会主义国家，受到了普遍热烈的欢迎，就是最生动的例证。这也说明了：任何国家，不论大小，只要它的政策是正确的，立场是正义的，它就一定会对它的国家和周围世界发生积极的影响，就能够产生出巨大的力量。柬埔寨王国有着这样的领导者，有着勤劳勇敢的人民，因此，它是坚强的，不可战胜的。我们相信，柬埔寨人民在西哈努克亲王殿下的领导下，一定能够粉碎任何外来的侵略和颠复阴谋，使自己的国家走上繁荣富强的道路，继续对亚洲和世界的和平事业作出新的更大的贡献。
    中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，高举着总路线、大跃进和人民公社的胜利旗帜，意气风发地为迅速改变国家的一穷二白的面貌而进行着忘我的劳动。我国的社会主义建设已经取得很大的成就，但是工作中也存在着缺点和困难。我们真诚地希望，亲王殿下和全体贵宾们在访问我国的过程中，通过亲身的接触，全面地了解我国的情况，并且对我们的工作提出你们的看法和批评。尊敬的西哈努克亲王殿下，尊敬的柬埔寨贵宾们，请允许我再一次对你们的访问表示衷心的感谢，并预祝你们的访问圆满成功。　现在，我提议
    为西哈努克亲王殿下的健康，
    为宾努阁下、福·波伦首相阁下、?·刁隆副首相阁下的健康，
    为柬埔寨全体贵宾们的健康，
    为中柬两国人民日益发展的友谊，
    为世界和平，
    干杯！
