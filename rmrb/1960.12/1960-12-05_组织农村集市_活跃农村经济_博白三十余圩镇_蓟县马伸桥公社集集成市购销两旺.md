Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, December 5th. Bobai County, Guangxi, is organizing rural market trade in a planned manner under leadership. All thirty-five large and small market towns in the county are bustling, with vigorous buying and selling, appropriately satisfying the needs of communes, production teams, and members in production and life, and promoting the development of agriculture, sideline occupations, and handicrafts.

Since the people's communes were established, Bobai County, starting from the development of production and the revitalization of the rural economy, has organized rural market trade in a planned and leadership manner. Every market day, members of the people's communes carry poles, baskets, push carts, and carry sacks, taking collectively managed and individually produced fresh vegetables, dried vegetables, fresh fish, chickens, ducks, eggs, tea leaves, tobacco leaves, wild hemp, small farm tools, household utensils, etc., to the market to sell to state-owned stores or exchange in the market to adjust surpluses and deficiencies. In terms of market trade forms, according to historical habits, it is generally held every three days.

In terms of market management, each commune, under the leadership of the commune party committee, organizes a market management committee jointly by relevant departments such as commerce, taxation, and banking at the commune level, and responsible cadres of the production team where the market is located. The committee guides market transactions, manages market prices, and maintains market order, achieving "management without rigidity, activity without chaos." Except for grain, oil and other materials that are uniformly purchased and sold by the state, all other agricultural and sideline products can be brought to the market for trading by people's communes, production teams, and members after completing the state's prescribed sales tasks. The market management committee stipulates market transaction prices and allows buyers and sellers to negotiate prices within a certain range. The market management committee also frequently conducts various publicity activities, educating commune members to only sell their own products and buy back the goods they need in market transactions, without engaging in resales, so that the market supply and demand are normal, buying and selling are fair, exchanges are active, and everything is in order.

This newspaper reports that under the leadership of the commune party committee, the rural market trade in Mashenqiao Commune, Jixian County, Hebei Province, is prosperous and active, playing a positive role in promoting production and is warmly welcomed by the local commune members.

The market town of Mashenqiao Commune is Mashenqiao Town. Major markets are held on the 5th and 10th days of the lunar month, and minor markets are held on the 2nd and 7th days. On market days, the market, which is more than half a mile long, is bustling with commune members, who bring piglets, chickens, sheep, rabbits, and various vegetables produced during holidays and spare time in the morning and evening, as well as household handicraft products such as carrying baskets, lifting baskets, manure baskets, cooking brushes, brooms, and small carrying poles, to the market for mutual trading according to their needs. As winter sideline production develops, the variety and amount of goods on the market have greatly increased, with varieties increasing from twenty-five to more than forty, and the amount increasing to more than 25,000 yuan. Yang Zhihai, a member of the Guzhuangzi production team, sold his brooms at the market and bought the bamboo rake he needed. He said happily: "It is really convenient to buy and sell in the market."

    组织农村集市　活跃农村经济
    博白三十余圩镇　蓟县马伸桥公社集集成市购销两旺
    新华社南宁5日电　广西博白县各人民公社有领导地组织农村集市贸易，全县三十五个大小圩镇，集集成市，圩圩活跃，购销两旺，适当地满足了公社、生产队和社员生产上和生活上的需要，促进了农业、副业和手工业生产的发展。
    人民公社化以来，博白县从发展生产，活跃农村经济出发，有领导有计划地组织了农村集市贸易。每逢圩日，人民公社的社员们挑担、提篮、推车、背袋，把集体经营和个人生产的鲜菜、干菜、鲜鱼、鸡鸭、蛋品、茶叶、烟叶、野麻、小农具、家庭用具等，拿到集市，按规定出售给国营商店或在集市上交换，以调剂有无。在集市贸易形式上，按照历史习惯，一般是三天一集。
    在集市市场管理方面，各公社都在公社党委领导下，由公社一级的商业、税务、银行等有关部门和集市所在地的生产队负责干部，共同组织市场管理委员会，指导市场交易，管理市场价格，维持市场秩序，做到“管而不死，活而不乱”，除国家统购统销的粮食、油料等物资一律卖给国家收购部门以外，其他农副产品，凡是人民公社、生产队和社员在完成了国家规定的交售任务以后，都可以拿到集市上交易。市场管理委员会规定市场交易价格，并允许买卖双方在一定幅度内议价交易。市场管理委员会还经常进行各种宣传活动，教育社员群众在集市交易中，只出卖自己生产的产品，买回自己需要的商品，不作转手买卖，从而使集市市场供求正常，买卖公平，交流活跃，井井有条。
    本报讯　河北蓟县马伸桥公社，在公社党委领导下，农村集市贸易繁荣活跃，对促进生产起到积极作用，受到当地广大社员的热烈欢迎。
    马伸桥公社的集镇是马伸桥镇，每逢旧历五、十为大集，二、七为小集。到了集日，长达半里多的集市上赶集的社员川流不息，广大社员带着自己利用假日和早晚空闲时间生产的仔猪、鸡、羊、兔和各种蔬菜，以及背筐、抬筐、粪箕子、炊帚、条帚、小扁担等家庭手工业产品来到市场，根据自己的需要，互相交易，有买有卖，贸易十分活跃。随着冬季副业生产的开展，上市物资的品种和金额大大增加，品种由二十五种增加到四十多种，金额增加到两万五千多元。古庄子生产队社员杨志海在集市上出售了自己做的条帚，买到了自己需用的竹扒子，他高兴地说：在集市上有买有卖，真是方便。（附图片）
