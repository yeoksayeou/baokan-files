This newspaper reports: Gansu Province's science and technology departments actively support agricultural development, with a large number of scientific and technical personnel going deep into the countryside and closely integrating with production to carry out scientific research.

The in-depth involvement of scientific and technical personnel in rural areas, along with the broad masses of commune members to carry out mass scientific research activities, has not only enriched the content of research, but also developed the ranks of farmer-scientists, enabling scientific research to develop rapidly. During the drought resistance struggle in rural areas this year, technical personnel from the Gansu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, in the countryside, held technical research symposiums with the masses, compiled forty important materials on the spot, introduced more than fifty kinds of drought-resistant improved varieties to people's communes in various places, and ten drought-resistant cultivation techniques for major crops. Scientific and technical personnel from the Lanzhou Institute of Geology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Glaciology and Cryopedology, and other units, together with local commune members, conducted work on melting ice and snow and searching for underground water sources in the Hexi Corridor and the central Loess Plateau, respectively. In the Qilian Mountains, at an altitude of more than 4,500 meters, they melted more than 7,000 cubic meters of ice, irrigating a large amount of farmland. Scientific and technical personnel throughout the province, in coordination with tens of thousands of people from various places, spent only four months completing a soil survey of more than 59.6 million mu of cultivated land, and compiled the "Gansu Soil Chronicle."

In order to firmly root scientific research activities in the mass movement of farmers, the Gansu Provincial Science and Technology Department, in accordance with the policy of "combining popularization with improvement," adopted various forms to train farmer-scientists, in order to improve and develop the ranks of scientific workers. The Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences is linked with eighty-nine rural communes, helping communes set up more than fifty experimental "small farms," cultivating ninety-three high-yield plots with a total area of 23,000 mu, which not only achieved high yields and increased income this year, but also trained hundreds of farmer technicians.

    丰富了研究内容　扩大了科学队伍　发展了科学事业
    科学工作者扎根农村如鱼得水
    本报讯　甘肃省科学技术部门积极支援农业发展，大批科学技术人员深入农村，紧密结合生产开展科学研究工作。
    科学技术人员深入农村，同广大社员一道开展群众性的科学研究活动，不但丰富了研究内容，而且发展了农民科学工作队伍，使科学研究工作迅速发展。今年农村抗旱斗争中，甘肃农业科学院技术人员在农村，和群众一起开技术研究座谈会，突击编写出四十种重要材料，向各地人民公社介绍了五十多种抗旱良种，和十种主要作物的抗旱栽培技术措施。中国科学院兰州地质研究所，冰川冻土研究所等单位的科学技术人员分别在河西走廊和中部黄土高塬上，跟当地社员一起进行融冰化雪、寻找地下水源的工作，仅在海拔四千五百多米的祁连山上就融冰七千多立方米，灌溉了大量农田。全省科学技术人员配合各地成万的群众，只用了四个多月的时间完成了五千九百多万亩耕地的土壤普查，编出《甘肃土壤志》。
    甘肃省科学技术部门，为了把科学研究活动的根子牢牢扎在农民群众运动的基础上，根据“普及与提高相结合”的方针，采取多种形式，培养农民科学技术工作者，以提高和发展科学工作队伍。省农业科学院和八十九个农村公社挂钩，帮助公社办起试验性的“小农场”五十多个，培养了总面积二万三千亩的九十三个丰产方，今年既获得丰产增收，也培训了成百的农民技术员。（附图片）
    兰州市雁塔公社的温室也是社员进行科学研究的基地。上图是温室外景；下图是社员正给温室培育的早熟西红柿浇水。
