Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 3rd: The 1960 National Volleyball League A-Level Tournament concluded on the 2nd. The Shanghai men's and women's teams won the men's and women's championships, and the Sichuan men's and women's teams won the men's and women's runner-up titles.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 4th: Xinhua News Agency reporters Lu Zuohua and Zhang Rongzheng reported: The 1960 National Volleyball League A-Level Tournament, after thirty-three days of intense competition in two stages, concluded on the 2nd.

A total of nineteen men's teams and seventeen women's teams participated in this league, holding a total of three hundred and seven games, making it the largest and most numerous national volleyball league in history. During the league, each team demonstrated a variety of offensive and defensive tactics and a style of striving for the top. They were full of energy, fought for every ball, and showed the flourishing state of volleyball in our country.

What impressed people most about the league was the excellent style of each team in learning with an open mind and striving for perfection. The Guizhou team, with its fine tradition of learning from others everywhere, competed along the way after departing from Guizhou, was modest and eager to learn from fraternal teams. They summarized after each game, so their technical level was greatly improved. In the nine games held by the men's team in Shanghai, five games were decided after five sets of fierce fighting with their opponents. They said: "Even if we lose technically, we must not lose in style." The Shanghai team, which won both the men's and women's championships in this league, won almost every game, but they were not arrogant. The women's team lost to the Sichuan team in the last game, but they were not discouraged. They seriously summed up their experiences and humbly sought opinions. The Chongqing women's team, with the most new players, found an object of learning for almost every player through the competition. Even if they only had a few minutes of rest, they did not give up the opportunity to learn from others. The Taishan men's team, which was still a B-level team last year, encountered the defending league champion "August 1st" team in the first battle of the competition. Faced with such a strong opponent, they did not flinch and attacked fiercely, finally winning three to one.

The teams participating in this competition were all active and aggressive, attacking quickly, flexibly and variably, and tenacious and brave. However, they each had their own unique style and their own way of playing. Therefore, every encounter was a very tense and exciting performance. The Shanghai team is known for its fierce attacks and varied tactics. The Sichuan team excels in its delicate, calm, and witty playing style. The "August 1st" team has the tenacious and brave fighting style of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The Taishan team is characterized by its short stature, comprehensive skills, wit, and flexibility. In the match between the Shanghai men's team and the "August 1st" men's team, the Shanghai team attacked fiercely and quickly; while the "August 1st" team fought back tenaciously, sometimes the two sides fought for a single ball for as long as eleven minutes. In one instance, the Shanghai team's attack was so fast and fierce that it seemed impossible to save, but the "August 1st" team's players rushed forward and rescued it from the crowd of spectators.

The increasingly close technical level of the participating teams is also a feature of this league. Even the Shanghai men's team, which was the only one to maintain a perfect record, lost one set in the match against the new team, Shandong. In past leagues, the "August 1st" and "Beijing" teams, which were among the top teams, have all lost to many B-level teams or teams that were considered weak in the past. Newcomers are emerging and making rapid progress. The Jiangsu men's team, which participated in the A-level league for the first time, defeated the strong Sichuan men's team and won eighth place. Each team has also mastered techniques more comprehensively and diversely than in the past, such as powerful hook serves, blocks, digs, and quick attacks, which most of the team's athletes can do. The athletes' physical qualities have also improved greatly. In the last day of the Shanghai-Sichuan match, the athletes continued to attack fiercely and jump freely, as bravely as they did on the first day of the competition thirty-three days ago.

    胜者不骄　败者不馁　虚心学习　精益求精
    全国排球甲级队联赛圆满结束
    贵州队队员说：即使在技术上输掉，决不能在风格上输
    新华社上海3日电　1960年全国排球甲级队联赛已在2日结束。上海男、女队获得了男女冠军，四川男女队获得了男、女亚军。
    新华社上海4日电　新华社记者陆左华、张荣铮报道：1960年全国排球甲级队联赛经过前后两个阶段为时三十三天的激烈比赛，已经在2日结束。
    参加这次联赛的共有十九个男队、十七个女队，总共举行了三百零七场比赛，是历届全国排球联赛规模最大人数最多的一次。联赛期间，各队都表现了多种多样的攻守战术和力争上游的风格，他们干劲十足，每球必争，显示了我国排球运动欣欣向荣的局面。
    联赛给人印象最深的，是各队的虚心学习，精益求精的优良作风。具有处处拜人为师优良传统的贵州队，从贵州出发后，沿途比赛，虚怀若谷，向兄弟队学习，比赛一次总结一次，因此技术水平又有很大提高。男队在上海举行的九场比赛，有五场是同对手经过五局激战后才分胜负的。他们说：“即使在技术上输掉，决不能在风格上输”。双获这次联赛男、女冠军的上海队几乎是连战连捷，但是他们并不骄傲。女队在最后一场比赛中败给四川队，但她们也不气馁，认真进行了总结，虚心地征求意见。新队员最多的重庆女子队，通过比赛几乎每个队员都找到了学习的对象，即使只有几分钟休息时间，她们也不放弃向人家学习的机会。去年还是乙级队的台山男子队，在比赛的第一战就遇到了上届联赛冠军“八一”队。面对着这样坚强的对手，他们毫不畏缩，猛打凶扣，终于以三比一获胜。
    参加这次比赛的各队，都积极主动、猛打快攻、灵活多变、顽强勇敢。但各有独特风格，各有各的打法。因此，每次相遇都有非常紧张、精彩的表演。上海队以攻击凌厉、战术多变著称。四川队以打法细腻、沉着机智见长。“八一”队有着中国人民解放军顽强、勇敢的战斗作风。身材不高、技术全面、机智灵活，则是台山队的特点。在上海男队对“八一”男队的比赛中，上海队一会猛扣，一会快攻；而“八一”队则顽强反击，有时双方来往争夺一球竟达十一分钟之久。有一球上海队扣得又急又凶，看来无法挽救，但“八一”队的队员急奔上前，从观众人丛中把它救起。
    参加比赛的球队的技术水平越来越接近，也是这次联赛表现出来的特点。即使是唯一保持全胜的上海男队，他们在与新队——山东队比赛时，也输了一局。在过去联赛中，名列前茅的“八一”、“北京”等队，这次都曾败给许多去年的乙级队或过去被认为弱队的队。新手风起云涌，进步飞速。第一次参加甲级队联赛的江苏男队，打败了强队四川男队，获得了第八名。各队技术也掌握得比过去全面、多样，像大力勾手发球、拦网、垫球、快攻等技术，多数队的运动员都会。运动员的身体素质也有很大提高，在最后一天上海对四川的比赛中，运动员照样猛打猛攻，弹跳自如，与三十三天前的第一天比赛时同样勇猛。
