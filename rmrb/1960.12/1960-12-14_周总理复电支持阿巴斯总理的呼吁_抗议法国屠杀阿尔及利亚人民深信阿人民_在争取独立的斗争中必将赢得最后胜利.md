    Your Excellency's cable of December 13 has been received. The government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people express their infinite indignation and strongest protest against the atrocities of the French colonialists in the large-scale massacre of the Algerian people in Algiers and other cities. When de Gaulle went to Algeria to carry out his conspiracies, the heroic Algerian people waged a resolute resistance against the French colonialists.

We firmly believe that the Algerian people will win the final victory in the struggle for independence.

Prime Minister Abbas's cable to Premier Zhou:
To His Excellency Zhou Enlai, Premier of the People's Republic of China, Beijing:
    I respectfully draw your attention to the collective massacres carried out by the French colonialists and the French occupying forces in Algerian cities. Especially in Algiers, two hundred thousand Algerians are besieged by French troops in the Casbah district, and these French troops are carrying out a massacre against them. Similarly serious incidents have also occurred in other districts of Algiers and in Arab residential areas in major Algerian cities. The situation is extremely serious. The French government bears a major responsibility for this. We are issuing an urgent appeal to you, asking you to take all measures to immediately stop this crime of exterminating the Algerian people.
    Please accept my highest respects.
    Abbas Ferhat, Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria
      December 13, 1960, Tunis
