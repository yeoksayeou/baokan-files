Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 17th: A grand meeting celebrating the 150th anniversary of the struggle for national liberation in Latin American countries was held in the Moscow Trade Union Building on the evening of the 16th, according to a TASS report from Moscow on the 16th.

From 1810 to 1825, struggles against Spanish colonial rule broke out in Latin American countries.

The meeting decided to hold a series of soirees, concerts, and get-togethers to celebrate this anniversary. The venue on the evening of the 16th gathered about two thousand people from all walks of life in Moscow.

Georgadze, Vice Chairman of the Council of the Soviet-Latin American Friendship and Cultural Cooperation Association, said at the meeting that the national liberation and anti-imperialist movement in Latin American countries is increasingly becoming one of the decisive factors in the modern international situation.

Georgadze described the close friendly ties between the Soviet and Latin American people, especially mentioning the mutual visits of delegations and the mutual visits of state leaders and social figures.

Referring to the victory of the people's revolution in Cuba, Georgadze said: The Soviet people are willing to do everything possible to defend the achievements of the Cuban people's revolution. Amid warm applause, the Cuban Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Meidiavilla, spoke. Meidiavilla said that now, as the 150th anniversary of the struggle of the people of Latin American countries for independence and freedom is being celebrated, there are still people who attempt to enslave the people of Latin America. After freeing themselves from the shackles of colonialism, some countries in Latin America became semi-colonies of American imperialism.

The Cuban ambassador emphasized that today, Cuba's cause, its freedom, and its survival are the cause of all the people of Latin America.

    莫斯科集会支持拉丁美洲民族解放斗争
    格奥尔加泽说苏联人民愿尽力保卫古巴革命成果
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科16日讯：16日晚上在莫斯科工会大厦举行了庆祝拉丁美洲国家争取民族解放斗争一百五十周年的盛会。
    在1810年到1825年间，拉丁美洲各国爆发了反对西班牙殖民统治的斗争。
    会议决定还将举行一系列的晚会、音乐会和联欢会，以庆祝这个纪念日。16日晚上的会场聚集了约两千名莫斯科各界人士。
    苏联—拉丁美洲友好和文化合作协会理事会副主席格奥尔加泽在会上说，拉丁美洲国家中的民族解放和反帝运动，日益成为现代国际局势中的决定性因素之一。
    格奥尔加泽叙述了苏联和拉丁美洲人民之间亲密的友好联系，其中特别谈到代表团的相互往来和国家领导人、社会人士的互相访问。
    格奥尔加泽在谈到古巴的人民革命的胜利后说：苏联人民愿意尽一切力量保卫古巴人民革命的成果。在热烈的掌声中，古巴驻苏联大使梅迪亚维利亚讲了话。梅迪亚维利亚说，现在，正当庆祝拉丁美洲各国人民争取独立和自由斗争一百五十周年的时候，还存在着企图奴役拉丁美洲人民的人。拉丁美洲人民当时在摆脱殖民主义枷锁之后，某些国家又成了美国帝国主义的半殖民地。
    这位古巴大使强调说，今天古巴的事业，它的自由和生存，就是拉丁美洲全体人民的事业。
