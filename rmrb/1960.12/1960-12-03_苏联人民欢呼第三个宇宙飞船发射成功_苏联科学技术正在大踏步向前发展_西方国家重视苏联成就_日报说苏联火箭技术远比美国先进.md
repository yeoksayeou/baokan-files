Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 1st. The news of the successful launch of the third Soviet spaceship has aroused enthusiastic cheers among the broad masses of the people.

In the streets and alleys of Moscow, people are talking about this exciting news, and many are gathering around radios and loudspeakers, listening to the TASS communiqué broadcast by the radio station.

After hearing the news, workers in various factories in Moscow expressed their excitement about this new achievement in Soviet science and technology. Golochkin, a worker at the Vladimir Ilyich Factory, said that the whole world is now applauding the new achievements of Soviet science and technology. The successful launch of the third spaceship once again proves the high level of development of Soviet science and technology. Launching the third spaceship only three and a half months after the second spaceship returned to Earth once again proves that Soviet science is advancing by leaps and bounds.

Golochkin also said that Soviet workers sincerely thank Soviet scientists, engineers, and workers whose third spaceship has added glory and pride to the Soviet motherland.

Another worker at the factory, Kalitin, said that Soviet workers are proud of the successful launch of the third spaceship. The successful launch of this spaceship will further accelerate the realization of human space flight. He said that after hearing the news, we seemed to have a new strength in our bodies, and we must work harder and contribute all our strength to the early completion of the Seven-Year Plan.

Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd. TASS reported: Many famous Soviet scientists have published articles and given talks commenting on the launch of the third Soviet satellite-type spaceship.

Mikhailov, director of the Pulkovo Observatory, told a TASS reporter that the launch of the third spaceship carrying test organisms is an extremely important step in solving the extremely complex scientific problem of humans becoming masters of outer space.

Academician Blokhin, president of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences, Vice President Timakov, and other scientists also believe that the launch of this spaceship is of great significance for human flight into space. They pointed out that Soviet doctors and biologists can once again test the impact of spaceflight conditions on the vitality of large and small animals, microorganisms, and plants.

The famous scientist Blagonravov told a reporter from *Izvestia* that the third satellite-type spaceship can accommodate more scientific equipment than the second spaceship, in order to expand the problems to be studied. Due to the progress of science and technology, the weight and shape of scientific instruments have been reduced, and measurement technology has been further improved, which makes it possible to conduct more accurate experiments. He also pointed out that one of the basic achievements of launching the second spaceship was the precise realization of all pre-made estimates and accurate landing. The previous experience has undoubtedly been used to make the new satellite-type spaceship more perfect.

Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences Dobronravov wrote in *Literature and Life* that the satellite-type spaceship is extremely close to the ground, with the lowest altitude from our planet being 187.3 kilometers. From such a spaceship, not only can extremely valuable scientific observations of various meteorological processes in the ionosphere be carried out, but also many other geophysical studies can be conducted.

The famous Ukrainian astronomer Tsesevich said that the achievements of Soviet cosmonautics are so great that they enable us to firmly believe that scientists will soon be able to solve the most important problems such as the origin of elements and the generation of primary cosmic rays.

Academician Barabashov of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, in talking about this major achievement, said that the time is not far off when manned spacecraft will be launched from Earth to the Moon and other planets instead of sending automatically controlled spacecraft.

Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd. TASS reported that the news of the successful launch of the third Soviet spaceship has once again attracted attention in capitalist countries. Many famous scientists have spoken out in praise. Some bourgeois newspapers have had to admit that this is a new and great achievement for the Soviet Union in conquering outer space.

American news agencies all believe that this is a new step for the Soviet Union in putting humans into space.

The famous British astronomer Moore said that this is undoubtedly a great achievement. Dr. Egon of the Greenwich Observatory pointed out that the day of human entry into space is getting closer due to the successful launch of this satellite. Some London evening papers carried the news that day with large headlines.

French observatories are constantly receiving signals from the Soviet spaceship. Scientists at the Paris Observatory said that French experts are awaiting the results of the spacecraft's flight with great interest. The famous science commentator Balne said that the important fact is that it is running on an orbit very close to the ground. In this way, Soviet scientists can observe the electromagnetic fields, cosmic rays, solar particle streams, and their effects on dogs in this area, which has been little studied so far.

The president of the Swedish Cosmonautical Association, Ertzstrand, said that from the point of view of ensuring the realistic possibility of human flight into space, the significance of the experiment is enormous. *Expressen* wrote that the day of human entry into space is approaching. The experiment conducted by the Soviet Union on December 1 was a general rehearsal.

Japan's *Asahi Shimbun*, in comparing Soviet and American rocket technology, pointed out that Soviet rocket technology is far more advanced than the United States. The newspaper said that the weight of the third Soviet spaceship is almost five times that of the American "Mercury" satellite, and the United States is only preparing to launch the "Mercury" satellite.

    苏联人民欢呼第三个宇宙飞船发射成功
    苏联科学技术正在大踏步向前发展
    西方国家重视苏联成就　日报说苏联火箭技术远比美国先进
    新华社莫斯科1日电　苏联成功发射第三个宇宙飞船的消息，在广大人民中间引起了热烈的欢呼。
    在莫斯科的街头巷尾，人们纷纷谈论这件令人兴奋的消息，许多人都聚集在收音机和扩音器旁，倾听电台广播的塔斯社公报。
    莫斯科各工厂工人听到了这次消息以后，纷纷发表感想，表示他们对苏联在科学技术中这次新成就的兴奋心情。弗拉基米尔·伊里奇工厂工人戈洛奇金说，现在全世界都在为苏联科学技术的新成就而鼓掌。第三个宇宙飞船的发射成功，再次证明了苏联科学技术发展的高度水平。在第二个宇宙飞船回到地面后三个半月就发射第三个宇宙飞船，这再次证明了苏联科学正在大步地向前发展。
    戈洛奇金还说，苏联工人衷心感谢苏联的科学家、工程师和工人，他们制造的第三个宇宙飞船，为苏维埃祖国增加了光荣与骄傲。
    这个工厂的另外一个工人卡利京说，苏联工人们都为第三个宇宙飞船的发射成功而感到骄傲。这个宇宙飞船的发射成功将进一步加速实现人的宇宙飞行。他说，听到了这项消息以后，我们身上好像产生了一种新的力量，我们要更好地劳动，为提前完成七年计划而贡献出一切力量。
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联许多著名科学家发表文章和谈话，评论苏联第三个卫星式宇宙飞船的发射。
    普尔科沃天文台台长米哈伊洛夫对塔斯社记者说，载有试验生物的第三个宇宙飞船的发射，在解决人成为宇宙空间的主人这一极为复杂的科学问题中，是一个极为重要的步骤。
    苏联医学科学院院长布洛欣、副院长季马科夫和其他科学家也认为，这个宇宙飞船的发射对人飞入宇宙具有很大的意义。他们指出，苏联的医生和生物学家可以再一次检验宇宙飞行的条件对大、小动物、微生物和植物机体生活力的影响。
    著名科学家布拉冈拉沃夫向《消息报》记者说，第三个卫星式宇宙飞船内可以容纳比第二个飞船更多的各种科学装备，以便扩大要研究的问题。由于科学和技术的进步，科学仪器的重量和外形都有所缩小，测量技术更臻完善，这就可能进行更准确的实验。他还指出，发射第二个宇宙飞船的基本成就之一是精确地实现所有预先作出的估算和准确的着陆，上一次的经验无疑已被用来将新的卫星式飞船制造得更完善。
    物理数学博士多勃隆拉沃夫在《文学与生活报》上写道，卫星式飞船极为接近地面，离开我们星球的最低高度是一百八十七点三公里，从这样的飞船上不仅可以对电离层中的各种不同的气象过程进行极珍贵的科学观察，而且可以进行许多其它的地球物理研究。
    乌克兰著名天文学家切谢维奇说，苏联宇宙航行学的成就是如此的巨大，这使我们能够深信科学家们不久就能解决像元素的起源、原始宇宙射线的产生等最重要的问题。
    乌克兰科学院院士巴拉巴绍夫在谈到这一重大成就时说，从地面向月球和其它星球发射由人驾驶的飞船而不是发出自动控制的飞船的时间，已经为期不远了。
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社报道，苏联第三个宇宙飞船发射成功的消息在资本主义国家又一次引起了重视。许多著名科学家都发言表示赞扬。一些资产阶级报刊也不得不承认这是苏联在征服宇宙空间方面获得的新的巨大成就。
    美国各通讯社都认为这是苏联在使人进入宇宙方面一个新的步骤。
    英国著名天文学家穆尔说，这无疑是一项很大的成就。格林威治天文台的埃根博士指出，由于这个卫星发射成功，人进入宇宙的日子更加临近了。伦敦一些晚报都在当天以大字标题刊载了这一消息。
    法国各天文台正在经常接收苏联宇宙飞船的讯号。巴黎天文台的科学家说，法国专家们怀着极大的兴趣在期待飞船飞行的结果。著名科学评论员巴尔内说，重要的事实在于，它沿着离地面极近的轨道运行。这样，苏联科学家就可以观测到至今还很少研究的这一区域中的电磁场、宇宙线、太阳粒子流及它们对狗的影响。
    瑞典宇宙航行协会主席埃尔茨特朗德说，从保证人飞入宇宙的现实可能性观点看来，实验的意义是巨大的。《快报》写道，人进入宇宙的日子临近了。12月1日苏联进行的实验就是一次总演习。
    日本《朝日新闻》在对比苏、美火箭技术时指出，苏联的火箭技术远比美国先进。这家报纸说，苏联第三个宇宙飞船的重量几乎是美国的“水星”卫星的五倍，而“水星”卫星美国还只不过是正在准备发射。
