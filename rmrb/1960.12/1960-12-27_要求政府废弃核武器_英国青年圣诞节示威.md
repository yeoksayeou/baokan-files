Xinhua News Agency, London, December 26th. Over eighty British youths began a 140-mile "coast-to-coast" march from Liverpool to Hull on the 25th – "Christmas Day" – to demand that the British government abandon nuclear weapons.

This march was organized by the British "Youth Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament." A "coast-to-coast" march of the same nature was also held in Britain last "Christmas."

The participants in the march range in age from eighteen to thirty years old. They will pass through the textile industrial city of Lancashire and some coal mining towns and villages in Yorkshire. The marchers carried leaflets calling for the abandonment of nuclear weapons and opposing foreign military bases in Britain.

Bob Grigory, the national secretary of the "Youth Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament," said that more people would join the march along the way. He said, "Our whole purpose is to expand our movement." He announced that they would be conducting propaganda and holding rallies for miners along the way. A meeting and torchlight parade will be held at the end of the march in Hull.

    要求政府废弃核武器
    英国青年圣诞节示威
    新华社伦敦26日电　八十多名英国青年在25日——“圣诞节”开始了从利物浦到赫尔共长一百四十英里的“从海岸到海岸”长途游行，要求英国政府废弃核武器。
    这次游行是由英国“青年争取核裁军运动”组织的。去年“圣诞节”在英国也举行了同样性质的“从海岸到海岸”游行。
    参加游行的人的年龄从十八岁到三十岁。他们将经过纺织工业城市兰开夏和约克郡的一些煤矿市镇和乡村。游行者携带了要求摒弃核武器和反对外国在英国的军事基地的传单。
    “青年争取核裁军运动”的全国书记鲍勃·格里戈里表示，在他们游行途中将有更多的人加入游行队伍。他说，“我们的整个目的是要扩大我们的运动。”他宣布，在游行途中他们将向矿工们宣传并举行集会。在游行终点赫尔将举行会议和火炬游行。
