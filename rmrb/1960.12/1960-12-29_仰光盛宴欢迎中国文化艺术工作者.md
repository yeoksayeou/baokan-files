Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, December 27th: Burmese Federal Minister of Culture U Ba Swe hosted a grand banquet here on the evening of December 27th to welcome the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation led by Zhang Zhixiang, Deputy Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and the Chinese Film Delegation led by Chen Bo, Director of the "August First" Film Studio.

At the banquet, which was filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere and attended by more than 500 people, U Ba Swe, on behalf of the Burmese government, extended a warm welcome to the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation and the Chinese Film Delegation visiting Burma. U Ba Swe said that the mutual visits of leaders and various delegations between China and Burma not only help mutual understanding but also further deepen the "Paukphaw" (fraternal) friendship between the two peoples.

U Ba Swe said that not long ago, Burmese Prime Minister U Nu led a delegation of more than 300 people to China to participate in the 11th anniversary celebrations of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the signing ceremony of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty. They were warmly welcomed and cordially received by the Chinese government and the Chinese people. Now, Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China will lead a friendly delegation of more than 400 people to Burma for a friendly visit to participate in the 13th anniversary celebrations of Burmese independence and the ceremony for the exchange of instruments of ratification of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty. This is the great friendship of 650 million Chinese people towards the Burmese people. We express our warm welcome and gratitude.

U Ba Swe said that in recent years, the friendly cultural exchanges between Burma and China have developed satisfactorily. He hoped that Burma and China would send cultural delegations to visit each other every year on this new and friendly basis. This will further enhance the long-standing traditional friendship between the two peoples.

At the end of his speech, U Ba Swe proposed a toast to the ever-growing friendship between the Chinese and Burmese peoples, and to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai.

Zhang Zhixiang, head of the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation, expressed heartfelt thanks to the Burmese hosts on behalf of the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation and the Chinese Film Delegation.

Zhang Zhixiang said, "In recent years, under the guidance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by the Prime Ministers of China and Burma, the friendly relations between the two countries have achieved unprecedented and great development. Cultural exchanges between the two countries have also achieved satisfactory results. It should be particularly pointed out that on the occasion of the 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Prime Minister U Nu led the Burmese government delegation, as well as military, cultural, trade, sports, and news delegations, to visit China and signed the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty with our Premier Zhou Enlai. Now, as the Burmese people warmly celebrate the glorious Independence Day of the Union of Burma, Premier Zhou Enlai will lead the friendly delegation of the People's Republic of China to Rangoon and will exchange instruments of ratification of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty. This is a joyful event that greatly encourages the people. These joyful events will forever shine brightly in the history of friendly relations between our two countries and mark a new historical stage in the broader and deeper development of close cooperation and cultural exchanges between China and Burma. Our Cultural and Art Delegation and Film Delegation's visit to Burma not only brings Chinese songs and dances, Peking Opera, movies, and the deep friendship of the Chinese people to the Burmese people, but also hopes that through this visit, we can make greater efforts to strengthen cultural exchanges and 'Paukphaw' friendship between our two peoples."

Zhang Zhixiang said, "The building of Sino-Burmese friendship has been successfully and satisfactorily completed. Like Burmese cultural and art workers, Chinese cultural and art workers are willing to be gardeners of the Sino-Burmese friendship building, using our culture and art as tools to cultivate beautiful flowers of Sino-Burmese friendship, and to make the Sino-Burmese friendship building more solid and forever magnificent."

Zhang Zhixiang proposed a toast to the great achievements of Sino-Burmese friendly relations, the further development of cultural exchanges between China and Burma, the friendly unity between the two peoples and artists, Asian and world peace, and the health of President U Win Maung, Prime Minister U Nu, and Minister U Ba Swe.

The speeches of U Ba Swe and Zhang Zhixiang were warmly welcomed by the people attending the banquet. Their speeches were repeatedly interrupted by thunderous applause.

At this banquet filled with "Paukphaw" friendship, Chen Bo, head of the Chinese Film Delegation, also proposed a toast to the health of the leaders of the Union of Burma, and to the further strengthening and development of Sino-Burmese friendship.

Among those attending the banquet were Thakin Khin Maung, Speaker of the Chamber of Nationalities, U Manh Bha Saing, representative of the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Duwa Sinwa Nawng, Minister of Kachin State Affairs, former Minister of Culture U Chit Thoung, Secretary of the Burmese Ministry of Culture U Ba Sein, Colonel So Min, head of the Burmese cultural delegation to China, Deputy Head U Soe U, and about two hundred famous figures from the Burmese cultural circles. Also present at the banquet were Li Yimang, Chinese Ambassador to Burma, Counselor Lei Yang, Xiao Ming, Peng Jinbo, Sun Shengwei, and Military Attaché Senior Colonel Jiang Keding of the Embassy.

    吴巴素说周总理访缅体现六亿中国人民对缅甸人民的伟大友谊
    张致祥说中国文艺工作者愿使中缅友好大厦更加巩固永远壮丽
    新华社仰光27日电　缅甸联邦文化部长吴巴素27日晚间在这里举行盛大宴会，欢迎由对外文化联络委员会副主任张致祥率领的中国文化艺术代表团和由“八一”电影制片厂厂长陈播率领的中国电影代表团。
    吴巴素在这个充满着热烈友好的气氛、共有五百多人参加的宴会上，代表缅甸政府向前来缅甸访问的中国文化艺术代表团和中国电影代表团表示热烈欢迎。吴巴素说，中缅两国领导人和各种代表团的互访不仅有助于互相了解，并且进一步加深了两国人民的“胞波”情谊。
    吴巴素说，不久以前，缅甸总理吴努率领了一个三百多人的代表团到中国进行访问，参加了中华人民共和国建国十一周年庆典和中缅边界条约的签字仪式。他们受到中国政府和中国人民的热烈欢迎和盛情接待。现在，中华人民共和国周恩来总理将率领一个四百多人的友好代表团到缅甸进行友好访问，参加缅甸独立十三周年庆典和互换中缅边界条约批准书的仪式。这是六亿五千万中国人民对缅甸人民的伟大友谊。我们表示热烈欢迎和感谢。
    吴巴素说，近年来，缅中两国之间的友好的文化交流有着令人满意的发展。他希望中缅两国在这个新的、友好的基础上，每年派遣文化代表团进行互访。这样，将会进一步增进两国人民的由来已久的传统友谊。
    吴巴素在讲话结束时，建议为中缅两国人民的友谊的日益巩固，为毛泽东主席、刘少奇主席和周恩来总理的健康干杯。
    中国文化艺术代表团团长张致祥代表中国文化艺术代表团和中国电影代表团对缅甸主人表示衷心的感谢。
    张致祥说，“近几年来，在中缅两国总理共同倡议的和平共处五项原则的指导下，两国之间的友好关系已经空前地获得巨大的发展。两国之间的文化交流也取得了令人满意的成就。特别应该指出的是，在中华人民共和国建国十一周年的时候，吴努总理阁下率领缅甸政府代表团、以及军事、文化、贸易、体育和新闻代表团访问了中国，并同我国总理周恩来签订了中缅边界条约。现在，当缅甸人民热烈庆祝缅甸联邦光荣的独立节的时候，周恩来总理将率领中华人民共和国友好代表团前来仰光，并将互换中缅边界条约批准书。这是大大鼓舞人民的喜事。这些喜事在我们两国之间友好关系的历史上将永远发出灿烂的光辉，并标志着中缅之间紧密的合作和文化交流将得到更广泛和深刻的发展，从而进入新的历史性阶段。我们文化艺术代表团和电影代表团对缅甸的访问，不仅为缅甸人民带来中国的歌舞、京剧、电影和中国人民对缅甸人民的深厚友谊，而且还希望通过这次访问，我们能够作出更大的努力来加强我们两国人民之间的文化交流和‘胞波’情谊。”
    张致祥说，“中缅友好大厦已经成功地并令人满意地建成了。像缅甸文化艺术工作者一样，中国文化艺术工作者愿意作为中缅友好大厦的园丁，利用我们的文化和艺术作为工具来栽培中缅友谊的美丽的花朵，并使中缅友好大厦更加巩固并永远壮丽。”
    张致祥建议为中缅友好关系的巨大成就，中缅之间文化交流的进一步发展，两国人民和艺术家之间的友好的团结，亚洲和世界和平，吴温貌总统、吴努总理和吴巴素部长的健康干杯。
    吴巴素和张致祥两人的讲话受到出席宴会的人们的热烈欢迎。他们的讲话一再被雷鸣般的掌声打断。
