Xinhua News Agency, December 5th dispatch from Calcutta: Indian authorities in Calcutta suddenly arrested thirteen people between November 24th and December 3rd, including Zhang Jing, principal of Xinghua Middle School; Xie Yingrui, vice-principal; Hou Xingfu, editor-in-chief of the Chinese newspaper "China News"; and Liu Weitai, chairman of the Shandong Fellow-Provincials Association.

Since February of this year, Indian authorities in Kalimpong and Calcutta have successively issued notices to some overseas Chinese residing there, ordering them to leave India or Kalimpong within a few days to three months. The notices did not state any reasons. Since September, the number of people receiving such notices has increased to dozens. Many overseas Chinese have repeatedly applied to local authorities for continued residence, stating that they have resided in India for a long time, have legitimate occupations, are law-abiding, have consistently maintained Sino-Indian friendship, and have family members in India who need support and care. They requested the Indian authorities to grant them the right to continue residing legally in India. In October, the Calcutta authorities issued another notice stipulating that the overseas Chinese concerned should personally report to the local immigration bureau three times a week on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and stipulated that they should not move their residences without written approval. At the same time, they further took measures such as detention, imprisonment, interrogation, and fines against them. Currently, the detention action is still developing.

These measures by the Indian authorities have placed the overseas Chinese concerned in a very difficult situation. They are no longer able to engage in normal occupations and face the threat of displacement and loss of livelihood, which has caused great concern and anxiety among the vast number of overseas Chinese in India. They feel that their legitimate rights of residence and personal freedom are not guaranteed, and they request the Indian authorities to stop taking the above-mentioned measures and allow them to continue residing in India from the perspective of maintaining the friendship and humanitarianism between the people of China and India.

    印度有关当局无理逮捕我侨民
    扣押行动还在发展广大华侨极感不安
    新华社5日讯　加尔各答消息：印度加尔各答有关当局在11月24日至12月3日突然逮捕了当地兴华中学校长张敬、副校长谢应瑞，华侨报纸《中国新闻》总编辑侯兴福和山东同乡会会长刘维泰等十三人。
    自今年2月份起，印度噶伦堡、加尔各答有关当局先后向旅居当地的一些华侨发出通知，限令他们在几天到三个月之内离开印度或噶伦堡。通知书上没有说明理由。9月份以来，接到此类通知的人数增加到几十人之多。不少华侨一再向地方当局提出了继续居留的申请，说明他们长期在印度居留，有正当职业，安分守法，一贯维护中印友好，而且家庭亲属都在印度，需要赡养和照料，要求印度有关当局给予他们继续在印度合法居留的权利。10月份，加尔各答有关当局又发出通知，规定有关华侨应在每周一、三、五三次亲自向当地移民局报告，并规定非经书面批准不得移动住所，同时进而对他们采取了扣押、监禁、审讯、罚款等措施。目前，扣押行动还在继续发展。
    印度有关当局的这些措施，已经使有关华侨处于非常困难的境地。他们已无法从事正常的职业，面临着流离失所和丧失生计的威胁，引起了印度广大华侨的极大忧虑和不安。他们感到自己正当的居留权利和人身自由得不到保障，要求印度有关当局能从维护中印两国人民的友好和人道主义出发，停止采取上述措施，允许他们继续在印度居住。
