Xinhua News Agency, London, December 3rd: The British monopoly capital's mouthpiece, the "Financial Times," today published an editorial expressing deep concern about the impact of the U.S.'s international payments crisis on the British economy and fearing that steps the U.S. might take would further worsen Britain's already fragile economic position. The "Financial Times" expressed dissatisfaction with the measures recently taken by the U.S. to cope with the sharp decline in its gold reserves. The editorial complained that the problems "that are always ignored until the last moment are always dealt with too hastily and considered too little." "There is undoubtedly a danger—which the change of (U.S.) government will not necessarily eliminate—that the U.S. authorities may take sudden, drastic action without consultation to make up for its balance of payments deficit."

The newspaper emphasized that such actions "will aggravate the climate of (Western countries') deflation, placing the United Kingdom in a particularly vulnerable position." "The consequences of this danger are too serious to be ignored."

Referring to Britain's current trade balance, the newspaper said, "Until now, the rapid deterioration of (Britain's) trade balance has been masked by the inflow of short-term investment funds from abroad (mainly from the United States). If this capital inflow stops, the overall payment deficit will immediately be reflected in the decline of reserves, and at this time, the reserves of other sterling countries themselves, suffering from falling raw material prices, are also declining."

The newspaper believes that these two tensions combined can easily produce a third tension: a sharp decline in British reserves.

The "Financial Times" also expressed concern about the prospects for British exports. It said, "There is no reason to hope that export earnings will increase rapidly. The rate of growth of world trade seems to have slowed down, while competition is becoming increasingly fierce. Judging from Britain's export performance when conditions were more favorable, the most that can be hoped for is that there will be no further significant decline in exports."

Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, December 1st: West German Deputy Chancellor and Minister of Economics Erhard reiterated yesterday in a speech in Bonn that West Germany has no intention of opening its coffers to help the U.S. ease its international payments crisis.

Erhard emphasized that West Germany is prepared to strengthen its own direct economic expansion in underdeveloped countries, uncontrolled by the U.S.

According to a report in "Die Welt" today, Erhard stated that the 4 billion marks of so-called "development aid" that West Germany intends to provide to underdeveloped countries will be "handed over as directly as possible" to those countries, without "the intermediate intervention of international organizations."

U.S. Treasury Secretary Anderson and Under Secretary of State Dillon recently requested during talks in Bonn that West Germany provide cash to the "International Development Association" controlled by the U.S. to help resolve the U.S.'s international payments crisis and promote foreign economic expansion plans under U.S. arrangements. At the time, West Germany rejected this request and insisted on providing 4 billion marks of "development aid" annually according to its own plans. About half of these funds will be capital exports from West German industry to underdeveloped countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 2nd: "Le Nouvel Observateur," published this week, carried an article entitled "The Dollar Crisis," which argues that the crisis is currently deepening and that even if a Democratic government takes office in the U.S. next year, it will not be able to salvage it.

The article says, "The U.S.'s (gold) reserves are of a rather unstable nature, because the total amount of these reserves is less than the total amount of deposits of foreign banks in the Federal Treasury. If these banks demand immediate repayment, (the U.S.) will not be able to repay them." The article says that if this "unfortunate situation" occurs, it would be "equivalent to the monetary suicide of the entire West."

The article believes that the new government that will be established in Washington will "not be able to allow things to develop in this way" and will take measures to prevent the U.S.'s foreign payment crisis from continuing to worsen. However, the article points out that the U.S. government faces a dilemma: at a time when a "dollar crisis" is occurring, U.S. enterprises are also mired in a "recession." If the next U.S. government takes "inflationary" measures "in the hope of circumventing" the "current recession" in industry and commerce, it will "weaken the dollar."

The article says that the White House will also formulate more policies in order to "transfer part of the difficulties encountered by the dollar to Europe (Western Europe)." The article is particularly concerned that the U.S. government will use the failure of Dillon-Anderson's mission to Western Europe as a pretext for taking "retaliatory measures" against Western European countries. The article uneasily says, "The capitals of the Old Continent will hear (the U.S.) say: 'When your (Western European countries') coffers were empty after the war, we helped you. Now that we are in trouble, you are letting us fall. Beware of retaliation...'” However, the article believes that even if the U.S. does this, it will not help much to resolve the "dollar crisis," because the crux of the problem lies with the dollar itself.

    美元危机日益加深　西方国家争吵不休
    英《金融时报》抱怨美国转嫁危机担心英国蒙受不利
    艾哈德表示西德将不受美国的控制直接进行经济扩张
   《法兰西观察家》担心美国将对西欧采取报复性措施
    新华社伦敦3日电　英国垄断资本的喉舌《金融时报》今天发表社论，对美国的国际支付危机对英国经济所产生的影响表示深切的忧虑，并担心美国可能采取的步骤会使英国已经脆弱的经济地位进一步恶化。《金融时报》对美国最近为应付其黄金储备的急剧减少而采取的措施表示不满。社论抱怨美国说，“非到最后时刻总是被忽视的那些问题，老是处理得太匆忙，考虑得太少。”“毫无疑问，存在着这样一种危险——（美国）政府的更换不一定会消除这种危险：美国当局可能不经过协商，突然采取剧烈的行动来弥补它的支付差额。”
    这家报纸强调说，这种行动“将加剧（西方国家）通货收缩的气候，使联合王国处于特别脆弱的地位”。“这种危险性的后果太严重了，决不能忽视。”
    在谈到英国目前的贸易收支情况时，这家报纸说，“直到目前为止，（英国）贸易收支情况迅速恶化的现象，由于外国（主要来自美国）的短期投资资金的流入而被掩盖住了。如果这种资金停止流入的话，总的支付逆差将立即在储备下降这一点上反映出来，而这个时候，苦于原料价格下降的其它英镑国家本身的储备也在下降。”
    报纸认为，这两种紧张合在一起很容易产生第三种紧张：即英国储备急剧下降。
    《金融时报》还对英国出口的前景表示担心。它说，“没有什么理由可以希望出口收入会迅速增加。世界贸易增长的速度看来已经缓慢下来，而竞争却愈来愈激烈。从在条件比较有利时英国的出口情况来判断，最多可以希望的是，出口不会再有大量的下降。”
    新华社波恩1日电　西德副总理兼经济部长艾哈德昨天在波恩的一次讲话里再次表明，西德无意解囊来帮助美国缓和国际支付危机。
    艾哈德强调，西德准备加强它自己的直接对不发达国家的经济扩张，而不受美国的控制。
    据《世界报》今天报道，艾哈德表示，西德打算拿出的对不发达国家的四十亿马克的所谓“开发援助”，将“尽可能直接交给”不发达国家，而不通过“国际组织的中间干预”。
    美国财政部长安德逊和副国务卿狄龙最近在波恩进行的会谈中，曾经要求西德拿出现款来交给美国所控制的“国际开发协会”，以帮助解救美国的国际支付危机，并在美国安排下推行对外经济扩张计划。当时西德拒绝了这一要求，而坚持要按照它自己的计划每年提供四十亿马克的“开发援助”。这些款项中约有一半将是西德工业界对不发达国家的资本输出。
    新华社巴黎2日电　本周出版的《法兰西观察家》周刊刊载一篇题为《美元危机》的文章，认为这个危机目前正在日益深重，即使美国民主党政府明年上台后，也没有办法挽救。
    文章说，“美国的（黄金）储备具有相当不稳定的性质，因为这些储备总额低于外国银行在联邦国库中的存款总额。假如这些银行要求立即把钱偿付它们，那（美国）是偿不起的。”文章说，如果发生这种“不幸的情况”，那就“等于整个西方的货币自杀”。
    文章认为，即将在华盛顿成立的新政府将“不可能听任事情就这样发展下去”，它将采取措施来防止美国的对外支付危机继续恶化。但是文章指出，美国政府面临的是一个两难的局面：在发生“美元危机”的时候，美国企业也陷于“衰退”。如果下届美国政府采取“通货膨胀”的措施“以期绕过”工商业“目前的衰退”，那就将“削弱美元”。
    文章说，白宫也将制订更多的政策以便“把美元遭到的困难的一部分转嫁给欧洲（西欧）”。文章特别担心美国政府将以狄龙—安德逊出使西欧的失败，作为对西欧国家采取“报复性措施”的口实。文章不安地说，“旧大陆各国的首都都会听到（美国）这样的话：‘当你们（西欧国家）在战后金库空虚的时候，我们曾帮助你们。现在我们遭到厄运时，你们却让我们摔下去。当心报复……’”但是文章认为，美国这样做也不会对解救“美元危机”有多少帮助，因为症结在于美元本身发生了问题。
