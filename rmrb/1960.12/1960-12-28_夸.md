　　Praise means commendation.

　　In the socialist construction of the motherland, there are many advanced deeds worthy of praise, and millions of heroic figures worthy of commendation. The several transferred cadres published in this column are part of them. People like transferred cadres Jing Deshan, Yu Yongxiang, and Li Yuexian may not have known Jin Wenjie, Feng Qi, and Zhu Ruihua in the past. However, because they have a red heart for vigorously developing agriculture, helping small team cadres improve their leadership skills, and seeking benefits for the masses, people write to praise their exemplary deeds. Such transferred cadres are now all over the vast agricultural front. Some are praised as "five-good cadres," some are elected as "red commune members," and some are praised as "wise men" or "good staff officers." These are all honors awarded to the transferred cadres by the masses, and they also show that the vast number of transferred cadres have not failed the trust of the Party and the people.

　　From these short articles, we can also see that there is still much work to be done to build rural people's communes, and that farmers need help in all aspects. The burden on the transferred cadres is heavy, but the future is also promising. Every transferred cadre needs to cherish their position, make a hundredfold effort, and show their talents to the fullest.

### 夸

    夸
    夸，是赞美的意思。
    在祖国社会主义建设事业中，有着许多先进事迹，值得夸奖；有着千万个英雄人物，值得赞美。这个专栏里刊登的几个下放干部，就是其中的一部分。像下放干部井德善、于永祥、李月仙，过去不一定和靳文杰、冯奇、朱瑞华相识；但由于他们有着大办农业的一颗红心，帮助小队干部提高了领导水平，替群众谋了福利，人们便提笔歌颂，赞美他们的模范事迹。像这样的下放干部，目前遍布辽阔的农业战线。被誉为“五好干部”者，有之；当选为“红色社员”者，有之；受人称赞的“智多星”或“好参谋”，也有之。这些，都是群众授予下放干部的荣誉，而它也说明了广大下放干部没有辜负党和人民对他们的信托。
    从这些简短的文章中，也可以看到建设农村人民公社，还需要作很多工作，从各方面给农民以帮助。下放干部的担子是繁重的，而前途也是大有可为的。每一个下放干部都需要十分珍重自己的岗位，百倍努力，大显身手。
