Some Issues in Implementing the Mass Line in Science and Technology Work
Shu Wen, Deputy Director of Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission

The practice of the great technological revolution movement proves that Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with the practice of China's revolution and construction, is not only a beacon guiding the Chinese people in class struggle, but also a beacon guiding us in the struggle against nature. Mao Zedong Thought guides us to correctly carry out the struggle on the science and technology front in all aspects, and the most fundamental point is: thorough mass viewpoint and mass line. Mao Zedong's assertion that "the lowly are the most intelligent; the noble are the most ignorant" has inspired hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and revolutionary young people to march toward science and technology and achieve brilliant victories. It proves that by advancing along the path of the Party's mass line and relying on the joint efforts of workers, peasants, revolutionary youth, and experts, we will surely realize the great task of technological revolution.

**Have a Thorough Viewpoint of Relying on the Masses to Develop Science and Technology**

Can relying on the masses rapidly develop science and technology? Whether from the quantity or the quality of the achievements, the practice of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement has affirmed this question. For example, in Shanghai, in the first nine months of this year, the industrial sector implemented 824,421 technological innovation proposals, and the city successfully trial-produced 5,485 new products and officially put them into production. Looking at the development level of science and technology, after more than two years of the Great Leap Forward, some aspects of industrial technology in the city, such as smelting technology, machinery manufacturing, textile technology, and the chemical industry, have reached or created advanced world levels. Medical work has made rapid progress in developing the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine and applying new technologies. The facts of leaps forward in basic theoretical research also constantly emerge. For example, under the impetus of the great tide of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement in the first half of this year, an important achievement was made in genetics: the discovery of a new genetic substance—ribonucleic acid—in bacteria.① Of course, the reason why the level of science and technology can be greatly improved in a short period of time is that the broad masses of people, including workers, peasants, young people, and experts, participated in scientific and technological activities. Not only have the old experts played a greater role than in the past, but it is particularly worth noting that the workers, peasants, and young people have played a significant role in the movement. At present, the number of members of the city's Science and Technology Association alone has reached 100,000. Many workers who were once considered to have little cultural knowledge are marching forward to science and technology with high spirits. Young people in research institutions also boldly and actively participate in and independently undertake research work. Many of our new science and technology departments are mainly established by relying on young people. From all this, it can be seen that the slow, poor, and wasteful way of a few people doing science and the fast, good, and economical way of the masses doing science are extremely obvious.

Why can the workers, peasants, and young people, who were once considered to lack cultural and scientific knowledge, show such a great role once they participate in the science and technology movement? This is because:

First, the workers and peasants have rich knowledge of production practice and retain long-term accumulated production experience and knowledge, including that accumulated by working people throughout the ages. This knowledge is often lacking in intellectuals. For example, in the past, botanists only understood individual plants, or even a part of an individual (individual isolated organs, tissues, or cells), and had almost no knowledge of large field plant populations, so they often could not correctly judge the growth of field crops; however, experienced farmers identify the quality of crops in the field, in addition to looking at the robustness of individuals, mainly from the structure and growth of the population. Liu Yingxiang, a model worker in Henan, used the metaphor of "three ears" to describe the morphological structure of the leaf layer of a wheat population: those with the morphological structure of "horse ears" and "pig ears" are not good wheat, and only wheat with leaf population morphology like "donkey ears" is the best. The Institute of Plant Physiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences gradually formed the new concept of population physiology by learning production experience from farmers. This is an excellent example of developing new scientific theories on the basis of mass experience. The treasure trove of knowledge and experience preserved by the masses is also extremely rich. For example, long-standing acupuncture and qigong therapies have played an important role in enhancing people's physical fitness, treating diseases, and developing traditional Chinese medicine. The production experience of workers is also the basis for technological innovation and technological revolution.

Second, the workers, peasants, and young intellectuals have strong revolutionary demands, demanding to quickly change the poor and blank face of the motherland, and demanding to quickly change their own working conditions and the backward status of knowledge. Many facts are sufficient to prove that the workers, peasants, and young people have played a leading role in the revolutionary movement of science and technology. In Shanghai this year, the ones who took the lead in the "four modernizations" movement were the revolutionary "knife" of the Zhichengxing Steel Products Factory and the seven-day revolution of the Lianhua Strip Steel Factory—realizing mechanization and semi-mechanization. Major creations in the chemical industry, such as the production of reactive dyes, were successfully tested by young technician Xi Xiangyun and workers of the Runhua Dye Factory in a small attic.

Third, workers, peasants, and revolutionary youth in science and technology work are often easy to accept the ideas of dialectical materialism and show the most valuable pioneering spirit. They strictly engage in scientific and technological activities to solve production and medical practice problems, are not restricted by old frameworks, and as a result, effectively promote the development of science and technology. On the contrary, old intellectuals have more book knowledge, which is of course very valuable; but they are also deeply influenced by bourgeois ideas, idealism, and metaphysical thoughts, lack a production viewpoint, and want to emphasize "science for science's sake," lack revolutionary spirit, and are full of doubts about new things. Therefore, if they cannot break through the old frameworks, they are often powerless in developing new scientific ideas, and often play a hindering role. The aforementioned formation of the concept of population physiology in plant physiology also shows that the peasant masses have great advantages in this regard.

Fourth, workers, peasants, and revolutionary youth love the Party, listen to the Party, are most politically sensitive, can quickly respond to the Party's call, and resolutely implement the Party's policies. The Party's call for theory linking practice, breaking superstitions, liberating the mind, striving to climb the peak of science, catching up with the world's advanced level, and the entire Party and the entire people running science, etc., has first received the most enthusiastic and rapid response among workers, peasants, and revolutionary youth, and immediately produced material effects, promoting the development of science and technology.

Mao Zedong pointed out: "Human production activity is the most basic practical activity," and people's understanding of nature and even society "mainly depends on material production activities."②. The laboring masses have both production experience and have undergone preliminary improvement in cultural level since liberation, have both revolutionary demands and simple dialectical materialist ideas, and have been enlightened by political and ideological revolution, so they have demonstrated a huge role in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement. Their knowledge is in many ways better than that of intellectuals. The so-called "the lowly are the most intelligent" is precisely such a scientific assertion. This is consistent in spirit with what Mao Zedong said in the past: "Many so-called intellectuals are actually the most ignorant, and the knowledge of workers and peasants is sometimes more than theirs."③. In the technological revolution movement led by the Party, workers, peasants, and revolutionary young people are growing into new experts in large numbers. However, some people still do not understand this point, and still think that only book knowledge is knowledge; they still think that the masses have no culture, and the experience of the masses is unscientific; they still think that the masses can only imitate, and cannot have scientific and technological creations, or that the masses can only create simple craft techniques, and cannot create high-precision products and promote the development of theory. All these are wrong views. From the many facts of science and technology development in the past two years, it seems that what can creatively promote technology and promote scientific development is fundamentally practice—especially the production practice of the working people, not books. Therefore, consolidating the viewpoint of relying on the masses—not only relying on the existing experts, but also relying on the workers, peasants, and revolutionary youth, and relying on the constantly growing new experts—to develop science and technology is a fundamental issue. Only with this viewpoint can we confidently implement the mass line of science and technology work.

**Have a Complete Set of Methods for Mass Popularization and Mass Improvement**

With the mass viewpoint, we also need a complete set of mass line working methods, which is mainly a complete set of methods for mass popularization and mass improvement in science and technology work. The experience of the technological revolution movement over the past two years has proved that to implement the mass line in science and technology work, there must be a mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution centered on production. Like the revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts, the revolution on the technological front must also be a revolution of the masses themselves. This movement must be carried out according to the needs of production. With the driving force of developing production, the masses have the production experience and the desire for technological innovation, plus correct leadership, the mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution can be launched. The technological innovation movement of the production departments is launched, and the research activities of professional scientific institutions also become active; technological reform promotes the development of the entire scientific activity, and the exploration of new technologies and new theories in turn promotes technological innovation. This is the main law of the development of the movement in the past few years.

The masses obtain knowledge from production practice, and they have more perceptual and partial knowledge, but insufficient knowledge of modern culture and science. Therefore, in science and technology work, there is also the issue of popularization and improvement. The "popularization" and "improvement" of science and technology are also "popularization among workers, peasants, and soldiers" and "improvement from workers, peasants, and soldiers." "Starting from workers, peasants, and soldiers" and "improving along the direction that workers, peasants, and soldiers themselves are advancing, improving along the direction that the proletariat is advancing." Mao Zedong's instructions on popularization and improvement at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art are also principles that must be followed in science and technology work. Without the production practice and needs of the masses, the "popularization" and "improvement" of science and technology cannot begin. The following are some main experiences in correctly combining popularization and improvement in mass movements.

First, the combination of indigenous and foreign methods is implemented in technology, as a principle of popularization and as a principle of improvement. Indigenous methods are the most abundant things in industrial and agricultural production, while foreign methods are few; without emphasizing the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, starting from the indigenous, there would be no mass movement of science and technology. Indigenous methods are also native and have the limitations of "experience." However, precisely because indigenous methods grow from a certain soil climate and have undergone the test of production practice, indigenous methods are also characterized by simplicity, advancement, and conformity to science. Foreign methods have an advanced side, and also have a backward side; many foreign methods must be combined with indigenous methods before they can be promoted and applied in our country. Indigenous and foreign, popularization and improvement, are two aspects that communicate and permeate each other. It is not a simple matter that indigenous is low-level and foreign is high-level. The combination of indigenous and foreign methods is the beginning of the popularization of science and technology, and it is also the highest requirement for the development of science and technology. This has been proven in many ways. The Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture and plant population physiology, acupuncture and qigong therapies of traditional Chinese medicine, fermentation in industrial and agricultural production—the application of enzymes④, were originally indigenous methods of the masses, but clarifying these issues from the theories of agricultural science, physiology, plant physiology, and biochemistry is a cutting-edge problem that these sciences need to tackle. In these areas, significant results have been initially achieved due to the implementation of the combination of indigenous and foreign methods. Modern industrial science and technology seem to only be foreign methods and cannot have indigenous methods, but this is not the case. The "four modernizations" movement of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation is the combination of indigenous and foreign methods for us. New modern technologies also have two aspects of popularization and improvement. Atomic energy science is the so-called cutting edge of the times, but the use of natural radioactive materials such as thorium in luminescent powder, the use of radiation to irradiate seeds, the production of automatic control devices, and the use of industrial flaw detection are all quite common technologies. As for radio and other technologies that can be used to carry out large-scale popularization movements by simple methods, this is something everyone knows. Higher mathematics seems to be a purely theoretical science, but linear programming in operations research is currently being promoted in factories and rural areas, becoming a tool for workers and peasants to rationally use and save manpower and materials. This shows that the masses can approach cutting-edge technologies and theoretical sciences through the path of popularization and application. There was once a bourgeois expert prejudice: modern science could be popularized in its early stages of development, so many common people could become inventors and scientists at that time; however, when modern science has developed to a high level, only experts can get involved, and workers and peasants are out of reach. This is a metaphysical view that reflects the bourgeois viewpoint of separating the dialectical relationship between indigenous and foreign, popularization and improvement. Modern science and technology of course has a high level, but as long as we have a strong mass viewpoint and can grasp the dialectical relationship between popularization and improvement, indigenous and foreign, we can inspire and mobilize the masses to march into all science and technology departments and gradually seize the fortress of science. Some fortresses cannot be taken down today, but they will definitely be taken down tomorrow, and the path is completely there. Therefore, according to needs and possibilities, actively taking the cutting edge from the indigenous, boldly popularizing new technologies to the masses, and combining indigenous and foreign methods in all possible aspects, we can find a bright road from mass popularization to mass improvement. Our workers, peasants, and young intellectuals already have confidence, but they must have even more confidence in advancing to all new technologies and new theories; our science and technology specialists must also find methods and paths for popularizing the science they are engaged in, planting the roots of all disciplines in the fertile soil of the masses, so that they can grow and develop rapidly.

Second, learning while doing is the main method for the masses to improve their scientific and technological level. Learning while doing and learning before doing are two basic methods of learning, but in the revolutionary movement of the masses, learning while doing is the main method. Mao Zedong said when discussing the issue of learning warfare: "Revolutionary war is the affair of the masses, and often they do not learn well before they do it, but learn while doing it, and doing is learning"; "Learning warfare from warfare—this is our main method."⑤. It can be said that this is the common law of people's revolution on all fronts, and the technological revolution is also the same. In the technological revolution movement, there are relatively few things that are learned before doing, and there are more things that are learned while doing and learned in doing. The masses have created many methods of learning while doing, and the main ones are: (1) The "five-sided" method of "researching, designing, trial-producing, applying, and improving at the same time," in which the various stages from research to production have both division of labor and are closely linked, mutually permeable, and coordinated under the direct participation of the masses. (2) Learning advanced experience from each other through evaluation, competitions, on-site meetings, visits, and cooperation. (3) Summarizing a section after doing a section, and systematizing and organizing practical experience. (4) Part-time work and part-time study, spare-time study, and various crash-style short-term training, learning what is needed for the work. In addition to this, of course, we should also organize systematic and formal learning under possible conditions. It is also wrong to ignore this kind of learning. But as a whole, this kind of learning is still relatively small; and in formal and systematic full-time learning, we must also strive to combine production labor in order to receive the effect of learning while doing. It should be pointed out that some people verbally agree that science and technology should be mass-based, but they only recognize one way of learning before doing, and do not recognize learning while doing and learning from doing. This actually cancels the mass movement of science and technology. Of course, if we only pay attention to "doing" and do not pay attention to summarizing and improving, we will not achieve the better effect of "learning." We should adhere to the main learning method of learning while doing, and at the same time not abandon the possible formal full-time learning. Only in this way can we improve the scientific and technological level of the masses in a faster, better, and more economical way.

Third, the three-way combination of internal and external, realizing the combination of experts and the masses under the leadership of the Party, is an excellent way to solve the relationship between popularization and improvement. The "three-way combination" developed in the technological revolution movement has the following main forms: (1) The three-way combination within the production unit, that is, the combination of workers (peasants), technicians, and leading cadres to jointly solve some major technological innovation projects; (2) The external or large-scale three-way combination, that is, the three-way combination of scientific research units (and schools), production units, and leading departments, to organize the research and trial production of certain major projects in a planned way, such as the professional groups and thematic groups of the Science and Technology Commission, and various forms of collaborative activities and technical on-site activities; (3) "Factories and institutes (schools) jointly engage in revolution," that is, from the research institute going down to factories to select topics, going down to factories to do topics, and going down to factories to promote, to factories and institutes jointly planning, dividing labor, and cooperating to engage in revolution together. The research institute not only conducts its own research, but also becomes the staff department of the production department of the same industry for technological revolution, and the teacher group for training workers, serving three purposes in one. Factories, institutes, and schools change from temporary cooperation to establishing regular cooperative relations, and even mutually holding positions and helping each other train personnel. In the relationship between experts and the workers and peasants, we cannot think that it is only a one-way problem of experts educating the masses, but at the same time, it is first of all a problem of experts learning from the masses. Only if experts first learn the standpoint, viewpoint, and production technology experience of the masses can they appropriately help the masses. The principle pointed out by Mao Zedong that "only those who represent the masses can educate the masses, and only those who are students of the masses can be teachers of the masses"⑥, as well as his advocated mass line training method of "officials teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officials, and soldiers teaching soldiers"⑦, are completely applicable here. The three-way combination is not only necessary for production departments to carry out technological innovation, but also for scientific institutions and schools to improve the level of scientific research and teaching. At the same time, because experts and the masses often have different viewpoints and thought methods, it is extremely important to strengthen the Party's leadership so that contradictions can be resolved correctly. The three-way combination of workers, peasants, scientific and technological workers, and leading cadres is indispensable.

In the work of popularization and improvement, we should especially strengthen the summary, consolidation, promotion, and improvement of the achievements of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement. Through summarization, we can grasp consolidation and promotion on the one hand, and grasp improvement on the other hand, combining reality and virtuality, so that we can achieve a three-fold harvest in production, science and technology, and ideology. Some production departments and academic societies have already carried out some valuable work in this regard in cooperation. They first use the three-way combination method to initially summarize the specific achievements of technological innovation and technological revolution and organize them into technical materials; then they hold discussion meetings to conduct technical appraisal, finalization, exchange, and promotion on the one hand, and explore scientific theory on the other hand; at the same time, they summarize work experience and philosophical thought. Producers, technicians, scientists, philosophers, and leading cadres participate together. After summarizing a section, they go back and do it again, and summarize it again in a few months. In this way, they constantly return and gradually improve, closely relying on the masses, combining the theory of continuous revolution with the theory of revolutionary stages, making the work more and more detailed, the movement developing more and more deeply, and achieving great results.

**Unite and Transform Experts to Work Together**

Whether to take the mass line or the expert line is one of the fundamental differences between the proletarian science and technology road and the bourgeois science and technology road. The Party's mass line in science and technology work requires relying on the workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals—the constantly growing new experts who are both red and expert—to develop science, and also requires relying on the active labor of various science and technology experts, rather than excluding them. Those science experts who are being transformed and who are somewhat bourgeois in their thinking and politics are also a force in science and technology work. Therefore, while striving to improve the cultural and scientific level of workers, peasants, and young intellectuals, we must also strive to unite and transform the existing science experts. We must attract them to actively participate in the political activities of socialist revolution and socialist construction, participate in the realistic political and ideological struggle, and constantly criticize the bourgeois standpoint and viewpoint with the proletarian standpoint and viewpoint; we must organize them to go deep into production practice and learn from the workers and peasants to remedy their impractical knowledge; in particular, we must be good at combining Mao Zedong Thought with science and technology business, and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide and summarize scientific and technological activities. On the science and technology front, the power of Mao Zedong Thought is becoming increasingly significant. Some people have begun to consciously master the weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to carry out work; some people have come into contact with it in their work practice, but they do not yet recognize it. Therefore, it is an urgent matter to improve the level of Mao Zedong Thought of all those engaged in science and technology work by adopting the method of "summarizing experience and improving thinking." And the most effective way is to organize scientific and technological personnel to devote themselves to the mass movement of technological revolution and study and summarize with the masses, so that their politics, thinking, experience, and knowledge can be comprehensively improved.

The technological revolution and the cultural revolution are the advance of the people in conquering technological backwardness and cultural backwardness. The technological revolution is not a simple problem of reforming technology, but a problem of workers and peasants themselves rising up to master science and technology. The workers and peasants must march toward science and technology with revolutionary methods, break through the old system and the monopoly of bourgeois experts, establish a new road and ideological system for developing science and technology, and replace those outdated old frameworks and outdated theories with many new principles and theories. This is a real mass revolutionary movement. It is a revolutionary movement that is being carried out simultaneously with the continuing deepening of the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts, and is an important part of the development of the socialist revolution. The most fundamental characteristic of this revolution is its mass character. Therefore, correctly implementing the Party's mass line can make this revolutionary movement develop vigorously and enable China's science and technology to rapidly reach the world's advanced level under the joint efforts of hundreds of millions of people.

① Previously, there was a prevalent concept in the biology community that deoxyribonucleic acid was the genetic material (called "genes" by geneticists) of all organisms composed of cells, and the role of other substances was ignored. Shen Shanjiong and other comrades of the Microbial Physiology Group of the Institute of Plant Physiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in their work on studying the biological function of nucleic acids, discovered that the transforming factor of penicillin-resistant heritable traits in Bacillus subtilis was not deoxyribonucleic acid, but ribonucleic acid. This proves that there are two types of genetic material, deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid, and that the two may have division of labor and coordination in genetics. This discovery will help to further clarify a major fundamental issue in today's biological science—the chemical basis of heredity. Some people abroad have also accidentally discovered the role of ribonucleic acid in heredity in other work. However, they did not conduct in-depth research due to being bound by traditional ideas, and then denied it themselves. Shen Shanjiong and other comrades also suffered setbacks in their work, but under the inspiration of "breaking superstitions and liberating the mind," they firmly believed that "books are not laws, and facts must be believed," insisted on conducting experiments, and finally made new discoveries.

　　④ Enzymes were formerly known as zymogen, and are proteins with catalytic activity in organisms. The vast majority of chemical reactions in organisms are carried out with the participation of enzymes, and various metabolic processes are catalyzed by complex multi-enzyme systems. The function of enzymes has strict specificity, a certain enzyme can only catalyze a certain chemical reaction, does not require high temperature, does not require high pressure, the reaction speed is very fast, and the catalytic efficiency is hundreds and thousands of times higher than that of inorganic catalysts. At present, no less than a thousand kinds of enzymes have been discovered in organisms. The application of enzymes is increasing day by day in fermentation, tanning, pharmaceutical, textile, starch, food and other industries, clinical testing, biological products, wound hemostasis and other medical undertakings, and pesticide testing, preservation and comprehensive utilization of agricultural, animal, and aquatic products and other agricultural practices.

    在科学技术工作中贯彻群众路线的一些问题
    上海市科学技术委员会副主任　舒文
    伟大的技术革命运动的实践证明，马克思列宁主义与我国革命和建设的实践相结合的毛泽东思想，不但是指导我国人民进行阶级斗争的明灯，而且也是指导我们进行自然斗争的明灯。毛泽东思想从各方面引导我们去正确地开展科学技术战线上的斗争，而其中最根本的一点则是：彻底的群众观点和群众路线。毛泽东同志的“卑贱者最聪明，高贵者最愚蠢”的论断，激发了亿万工农群众和革命知识青年去向科学技术进军，取得了辉煌的胜利。证明沿着党的群众路线的道路前进，依靠着工农群众、革命青年和专家的共同努力，我们一定会实现技术革命的伟大任务。
    要有彻底依靠群众发展科学技术的观点
    依靠群众能不能迅速发展科学技术？无论是从成绩的数量还是从成绩的质量方面来看，技术革新、技术革命运动的实践都已经肯定地回答了这个问题。如上海市今年前九个月中，工业部门实施的技术革新建议就有八十二万四千四百二十一件，全市试制成功新产品并已正式投入生产的有五千四百八十五种。再从科学技术的发展水平来看，经过两年多来的大跃进，全市工业技术中的冶炼技术、机械制造、纺织技术、和化学工业的某些方面，都达到或创造了世界先进的水平。医学工作在发展祖国医学遗产和应用新技术等方面，都有日新月异的进展。基本理论研究方面也不断出现跃进的事实。如在今年上半年技术革新、技术革命运动大浪潮的推动之下，在遗传学方面就获得发现细菌体中新的遗传物质——核糖核酸的重要成就。①在短期内科学技术水平能够获得这样大的提高，当然是由于包括工农群众、青年、专家在内的广大群众参加了科学技术活动。不仅是老的专家起了比过去更大的作用，而且特别值得注意的，是工农群众和青年在运动中起了显著作用。目前，仅是全市科学技术协会的会员就达十万人。许多一向被认为文化不高的工人，意气风发地向科学技术突击前进。研究机关中的青年也大胆积极参加并独立担负研究工作。我们不少新的科学技术部门，主要是依靠青年建立起来的。从这一切中可以看出，少数人办科学的少慢差费和群众办科学的多快好省是至为明显的。
    一向被认为缺少文化科学知识的工农群众和青年，一旦参加科学技术运动为什么就能表现出如此巨大的作用？这是由于：
    第一，工农群众有丰富的生产实践的知识，保留有长期积累起来的包括历代劳动人民积累起来的生产经验和知识。这些知识常常是知识分子所缺少的。例如，过去植物学者只了解植物的个体，甚至是个体的某一部分（个别离体的器官、组织或细胞），而对大田植物群体几乎没有知识，因此常常不能正确地判断大田作物的生长情况；但是有经验的农民鉴别田中作物的好坏，除了看个体的健壮以外，更主要地是从群体的结构和生长情况着眼。河南劳动模范刘应祥用“三只耳朵”的比喻来形容小麦群体叶层的形态结构：形态如“马耳朵”、“猪耳朵”的都不是好麦，唯有叶子群体形态如“驴耳朵”的麦子最好。中国科学院植物生理研究所在向农民学习生产经验中，逐步形成群体生理的新的概念。这是在群众经验的基础上发展新的科学理论的极好的例子。群众保存的知识经验的宝藏也是极为丰富的，如长期留传下来的针灸、气功疗法已为增强人民体质、治疗疾病和发展祖国医学科学起了重要的作用。工人同志的生产经验，同样是技术革新、技术革命的基础。
    第二，工农群众、青年知识分子有强烈的革命要求，要求迅速改变祖国的一穷二白的面貌，要求迅速改变自己的劳动条件和知识落后的地位。许多事实足以证明工农群众和青年在科学技术的革命运动中起了带头作用。上海市今年在“四化”运动中起了带头作用的，是志成兴钢铁制品工厂的一把菜刀闹革命和联华带钢厂的七天革个命——实现机械化和半机械化的事实。在化学工业上的重大创造，如活性染料的制作，是润华染料厂的青年技术员奚翔云和工人同志在一个阁楼上试验成功的。
    第三，工农群众和革命青年在科学技术工作上，常常易于接受辩证唯物主义的思想，表现出最可贵的首创精神。他们严格地为解决生产、医疗实践问题而去从事科学技术活动，不受旧的框框限制，结果是有效地推动了科学技术的发展。反之，旧的知识分子有较多的书本知识，这当然是很可贵的；但是他们又深受资产阶级观点、唯心主义、形而上学的思想影响，缺乏生产观点，而要强调“为科学而科学”，缺乏革命精神，而对新事物疑虑重重。因此，他们如果不能突破旧的框框，在发展新的科学思想方面，反而常常无能为力，并且还常起阻碍的作用。前述植物生理中群体生理概念的形成，也说明农民群众在这一方面有着很大的优点。
    第四，工农群众和革命青年热爱党、听党的话，在政治上最敏感，能够迅速响应党的号召，坚决贯彻党的方针政策。党的理论联系实际，破除迷信、解放思想，努力攀登科学高峰、赶上世界先进水平，全党全民办科学等等号召，都首先在工农和革命青年中得到最热烈而迅速的反应，并立即产生物质的效果，推动科学技术的发展。
    毛泽东同志指出：“人类的生产活动是最基本的实践活动”，人对自然的了解以至对社会的了解，“主要地依赖于物质的生产活动。”②。劳动群众既有生产经验，又经过解放以来文化水平的初步提高，既有革命要求和朴素的辩证唯物主义的思想，又经过政治思想革命的启发，因此在技术革新、技术革命运动中，就表现了巨大的作用。他们的知识，在许多方面还比知识分子高明。所谓“卑贱者最聪明”，正是这样一种科学的论断。这和毛泽东同志过去所说的，“许多所谓知识分子，其实是比较地最无知识的，工农分子的知识有时倒比他们多一点。”③在精神上是一致的。在党所领导的技术革命运动中，工农群众和革命知识青年，正大批地成长为新的专家。但是，至今还有一些人不了解这一点，还以为只有书本知识才是知识；还以为群众没有文化，群众的经验不科学；还以为群众只能模仿，不能有科学技术上的创造，或则群众只能创造简单的工艺技术，而不能创造高精尖产品和推动理论的发展。这些都是错误的看法。从两年来科学技术发展的许多事实看来，能够创造性地推动技术、推动科学发展的，从根本上说，始终是实践——特别是劳动人民的生产实践，而不是书本。因此，巩固地树立依靠群众——不光是依靠现有的专家，而且是依靠工农群众和革命青年，依靠不断成长起来的新的专家——发展科学技术的观点，是一个根本问题。只有具备这个观点，才能有信心地去贯彻科学技术工作的群众路线。
    要有大普及大提高的一整套方法
    有了群众观点，还要有一整套的群众路线的工作方法，这主要是科学技术工作大普及大提高的一整套方法。两年多来技术革命运动的经验证明，在科学技术工作上贯彻群众路线，必须有以生产为中心的技术革新、技术革命的群众运动，和经济、政治、思想战线的革命一样，技术战线的革命，也必须是群众自己的革命运动。这种运动必须根据生产的需要来进行。有了发展生产的推动力，群众又有生产经验和技术革新的要求，再加上正确的领导，技术革新、技术革命的群众运动便能开展起来。生产部门的技术革新运动开展了，专业科学机关的研究活动也就跟着活跃起来；技术改革推动整个科学活动的开展，新技术、新理论的探索又带动技术的革新。这是几年来运动发展的主要规律。
    群众从生产实践中获得知识，是感性的局部的知识多，现代文化科学的知识是不足的。因此，在科学技术工作上又有普及和提高的问题。科学技术上的“普及”和“提高”，也是“向工农兵普及”，“从工农兵提高”。“从工农兵出发”，“沿着工农兵自己前进的方向去提高，沿着无产阶级前进的方向去提高。”毛泽东同志在延安文艺座谈会上关于普及与提高的指示，同样是在科学技术工作上必须遵循的原则。离开群众的生产实践和需要，科学技术的“普及”和“提高”都无从着手。以下是在群众运动中关于正确地结合普及与提高的几个主要经验。
    第一，在技术上实行土法和洋法结合，以之作为普及的原则，也作为提高的原则。土法是在工农业生产中最大量存在的东西，洋法则是少数；不强调土洋结合，从土入手，便没有科学技术的群众运动。土法又是土生土长的，带有“经验”的局限性。但是，正因为土法从一定的土壤气候中生长，历经生产实践的考验，所以土法又表现为简易、先进、合乎科学的特性。洋法有先进的一面，同样也有落后的一面；许多洋法并要经过与土法结合，才能在我国推广应用。土与洋、普及与提高，正是互相沟通、互相渗透的两个方面。并非简单的土就是低级，洋就是高级。土洋结合是科学技术普及的开始，也是科学技术发展的最高要求。这在许多方面都已得到证明。农业的八字宪法和植物群体生理，中医的针灸、气功疗法，工农业生产中发酵——酶的应用④，原来都是群众的土办法，而从农业科学、生理学、植物生理学、生物化学的理论上弄清这些问题，却是这些科学需要攻取的尖端难题。在这些方面由于实行土洋结合，大家知道已经初步取得显著的效果。近代工业科学技术似乎只能是洋法而不能有土法，实则不然。机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化的“四化”运动，在我们就是土洋结合的。现代新技术也有普及和提高两个方面。原子能科学是所谓时代的尖端，但是天然放射性物质的利用如钍用在夜光粉上、利用射线来照射种子、制作自动控制装置和进行工业探伤，都已经是相当平常的技术。至于无线电等技术可以简易的方法大搞普及运动，更是大家知道的事。高等数学似乎是纯理论的科学，但是运筹学中的线性规划目前已经在工厂和农村推行，成为工农群众合理使用和节约人力、物力的工具。这说明可以通过普及应用的道路使群众接近尖端技术和理论科学。曾经有这样一种资产阶级专家的偏见：近代科学在它的发展初期是可以普及化的，因此当时不少平民能够成为发明家、科学家；然而当现代科学已向高深水平发展之后，就只有专家可以问津，而工农群众对之就是可望而不可及了。这是反映资产阶级观点的割裂土与洋、普及与提高之间的辩证关系的形而上学的看法。近代科学技术当然有高深的一面，但是只要我们有强烈的群众观点，又能掌握普及与提高、土与洋的辩证关系，就可以启发、发动群众向一切科学技术部门进军，逐步夺取科学的堡垒。有些堡垒今天不能攻下，明天也一定可以攻下，通路是完全存在的。因此，根据需要与可能，积极地从土中出尖，大胆地向群众普及新技术，在一切可能的方面都把土法和洋法结合起来，我们就能够找出一条从大普及到大提高的光明大道。我们的工农群众、知识青年已经有信心，但还要更有信心地向一切新技术、新理论前进；我们的科学技术专门家也都要为自己从事的科学找出大普及的方法和道路，把各门学科的根都植到群众的肥沃土壤中去，让它迅速地滋长壮大。
    第二，边干边学是群众提高自己的科学技术水平的主要方法。边干边学和学了再干是学习的两种基本方法，然而在群众的革命运动中，边干边学却是主要的方法。毛泽东同志在论学习战争问题时曾说：“革命战争是民众的事，常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习”；“从战争学习战争——这是我们的主要方法。”⑤可以说这是各个战线的人民革命的共同规律，技术革命也是如此。在技术革命运动中学了再干的事是比较少的，更多的则是边干边学，在干中学。群众创造的边干边学的方法是很多的，主要的有：（1）“边研究、边设计、边试制、边运用、边改进”的“五边”办法，在群众的直接参加之下，使从研究到生产的各个阶段既有分工，又密切联系互相渗透配合。（2）通过评比、竞赛、现场会、参观、访问、协作，互相学习先进经验。（3）做一段总结一段，把实践经验加以系统化条理化。（4）半工半读、业余学习、各种突击式的短期训练等，干什么学习什么。除这以外，当然我们还应当在可能条件下组织有系统的正规的学习。忽视这种学习，也是错误的。但是就全部来说，这种学习还是比较少数的；而且在正规的有系统的脱产的学习中，也要努力结合生产劳动，以便收到边干边学的效果。应当指出，有些人在口头上也赞成科学技术应当群众化，可是他们只承认先学后干一种方式，不承认边干边学、从干中学。这实际上是取消了科学技术的群众运动。当然，如果只是注意“干”，而不注意去做总结和提高工作，也达不到“学”的更好效果。我们应当坚持边干边学这一主要的学习办法，同时又不放弃可能的正规的脱产的学习。只有这样，才能多快好省地提高群众的科学技术水平。
    第三，内外三结合，在党的领导下实现专家与群众结合，是解决普及与提高关系的极好方式。在技术革命运动中发展起来的“三结合”有以下几种主要形式：（1）生产单位内部的三结合，即工人（农民）、技术人员、领导干部三结合，共同解决一些重大的技术革新项目；（2）外部的或大范围的三结合，即科学研究单位（和学校）、生产单位、领导部门三结合，有计划地组织某些重大项目的研究和试制，如科委的专业组、专题组以及各种形式的协作组，技术上门的活动等；（3）“厂所（校）一家闹革命”，即从研究机关的下厂选题、下厂做题、下厂推广，到厂、所共同规划、分工协作一起闹革命。研究所不仅自己搞研究，还要成为同行业生产部门的技术革命的参谋部，训练工人的教师团，一身而三任。厂、所、校从临时协作，到建立经常协作关系，以至互相兼职，互相帮助培训人员。在专家和工农群众的关系上，不能以为只是单方面的专家去教育群众的问题，而同时首先是专家向群众学习的问题。专家只有首先学习群众的立场、观点和生产技术经验，然后才能适当地去帮助群众。毛泽东同志指出的“只有代表群众才能教育群众，只有做群众的学生才能做群众的先生”⑥这一原则，以及他提倡的“官教兵、兵教官、兵教兵”的群众路线的练兵方法⑦，在这里也是完全适用的。三结合不仅对于生产部门进行技术革新是必要的，对于科学机关和学校的提高科学研究水平和教学水平也同样是必要的。同时由于专家与群众常有不同的观点和思想方法，因此加强党的领导，使矛盾能以正确解决，极为重要。工农群众、科学技术工作者、领导干部三结合，是不能缺少一方的。
    在普及和提高的工作上，目前应当特别加强技术革新、技术革命运动成果的总结、巩固、推广和提高的工作。通过总结，一手抓巩固和推广；一手抓提高，虚实并举，使在生产上、科学技术上和思想上三丰收。有些生产部门和学会合作已经在这方面进行了一些很有价值的工作。他们首先以三结合的方法，将技术革新、技术革命的具体成果，加以初步总结，整理成技术资料；然后举行讨论会，一面进行技术鉴定、定型、交流和推广，一面进行科学理论的探讨；同时又进行工作经验、哲学思想的总结。生产者、技术人员、科学家、哲学工作者和领导干部一齐参加。总结一段，回去再做，过几个月又总结一次。如此不断返复和逐步提高，紧紧依靠群众，使不断革命论与革命阶段论相结合，使工作越做越细，运动发展越来越深入，收效很大。
    要团结改造专家共同工作
    是走群众路线，还是走专家路线，这是无产阶级科学技术道路与资产阶级科学技术道路的根本分歧之一。党在科学技术工作上的群众路线，要求依靠工农群众、革命知识分子——不断成长起来的又红又专的新的专家来发展科学，同时也要求依靠各种科学技术专家的积极劳动，而不是排斥他们。那些正在改造的在思想政治上多少带有资产阶级色彩的科学专家，同样是科学技术工作中的一支力量。因此，在努力提高工农、青年知识分子的文化科学水平时，还必须努力团结改造现有的科学专家。要吸引他们积极参加社会主义革命、社会主义建设的政治活动，参加现实的政治思想斗争，使之不断地以无产阶级的立场、观点去批判资产阶级的立场、观点；要组织他们深入生产实际，向工农群众学习，以补救他们的知识的不切实际；特别是还要善于将毛泽东思想和科学技术业务结合起来，运用毛泽东思想去指导和总结科学技术活动。在科学技术战线上，毛泽东思想的威力日益显著。有些人已经开始自觉掌握毛泽东思想的武器去进行工作；有些人虽在工作实践中接触到了，却还不认识它。因此，采取“总结经验，提高思想”的方法，来提高一切从事科学技术工作者的毛泽东思想的水平，是当前迫切要做的事情。而最有效的途径，便是组织科学技术人员投身到技术革命的群众运动中去，和群众一起研究，一起总结，使他们的政治、思想和经验、知识得到全面的提高。
    技术革命和文化革命是人民群众征服技术落后和文化落后的进军。技术革命不是一个简单的革新技术的问题，而是一个工农群众自己起来掌握科学、掌握技术的问题。工农群众要用革命的方法向科学技术进军，冲破旧的制度和资产阶级专家的垄断，建立新的发展科学技术的道路和思想体系，要以许多新的原理、理论去代替那些过时的老框框和陈旧的理论。这是一个名副其实的群众的革命运动。它是和经济战线、政治战线和思想战线的社会主义革命的继续深入同时进行的革命运动，是社会主义革命发展的一个重要部分。这个革命的最根本特点，就在于它的群众性。因此，正确地贯彻党的群众路线，就能使这一革命运动蓬勃发展，使我国科学技术事业在几亿人民的共同努力之下，迅速达到世界先进的水平。
    ①以前生物学界流行着一个普遍的概念，即认为去氧核糖核酸是所有由细胞组成的有机体的遗传物质（遗传学家称为“基因”），而忽视了其他物质的作用。中国科学院植物生理研究所微生物生理组沈善炯等同志在研究核酸的生物学功能的工作中，发现在枯草杆菌中抗青霉素遗传性状的转变因素不是去氧核糖核酸，而是核糖核酸。这证明遗传物质有去氧核糖核酸和核糖核酸两种，而且二者在遗传上可能有分工与协调的作用。这个发现将有助于进一步阐明当今生物科学上的一项重大基本问题——遗传的化学基础。关于核糖核酸在遗传中的作用，国外也曾有人在别的工作中偶然发现过。但是，他们因受传统思想束缚而未作深入研究，并随即自己否定了。沈善炯等同志在工作中也曾屡受挫折，然而他们在“破除迷信，解放思想”的启示下，深信“书本不是法律，必须相信事实”，坚持进行试验，终于获得新的发现。

　　④酶旧称酵素，是生物体内具有催化作用的蛋白质。生物体内绝大多数的化学反应均在酶的参与下进行，各种新陈代谢过程都是通过复杂的多酶系统所催化的。酶的作用具有严格的专一性，一定的酶只能催化一定的化学反应，既不需要高温，又不需要高压，反应速度很快，催化效率比无机催化剂高何止千百倍。目前在生物体内发现的酶已不下一千种。在发酵、制革、制药、纺织、淀粉、食品等工业，临床检验，生物制品，创伤止血等医疗事业和农药检验，农畜水产品的保存与综合利用等农业实践中，酶的应用正与日俱增。
