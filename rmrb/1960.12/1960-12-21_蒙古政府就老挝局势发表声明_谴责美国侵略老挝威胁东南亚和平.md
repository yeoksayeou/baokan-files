Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, December 20th. The Mongolian newspaper "Unen" published today a statement by the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic regarding the situation in Laos.

The statement pointed out that US imperialism and its lackeys, opposing the freedom and independence of Laos, have been carrying out subversive activities against the legitimate government of Laos, which pursues a policy of national unification and peaceful neutrality, making the situation in Laos particularly tense. The statement said that the imperialist acts of aggression have grossly violated the 1954 Geneva Accords. It said that the acts of aggression by the American warmongers once again demonstrate that they are the stranglers of the freedom and independence of all peoples and the vicious enemies of peace. The statement pointed out that the Phoumi Nosavan reactionary clique, under the direction of the United States, disregards the national interests of the Laotian people, attempting to turn Laos into a US colony and military base, and has carried out various conspiracies, posing a threat to peace and security in Southeast Asia.

The statement said that the entire Mongolian people and the Mongolian government resolutely condemn the aggressive activities of US imperialism and its lackeys in attempting to overthrow the legitimate government of Laos and establish a ruling system favorable to the United States. The Mongolian people, along with peace-loving people around the world, believe that the Phouma government is the only legitimate government of Laos and fully support all progressive forces in Laos who are engaged in a heroic struggle for the peaceful development of Laos. The statement concluded by saying that the Mongolian government fully supports the propositions put forward by the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to restore the normal situation in Laos and immediately cease interference in its internal affairs.

The Mongolian government declares that US imperialism and its lackeys must be held responsible for the acts of aggression aimed at overthrowing the legitimate government of Laos and provoking a bloody war among the Laotian people. The Mongolian people and the Mongolian government sympathize with and support the heroic struggle of the Laotian people against foreign colonialists and rebels and for peace and independence.
