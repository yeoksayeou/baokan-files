    Still Need to Keep Learning
    Lü Genze, Hailan Production Team, Dongsheng People's Commune, Yanji, Jilin

    I was originally a student, and after leaving school, I volunteered to participate in agricultural labor in the countryside. In participating in agricultural labor, I deeply felt that although I had studied for several years, these book knowledge were far from enough when I came into contact with practice. Because today, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, our rural people's communes are developing rapidly. If we do not constantly study hard in practical life and production struggles, our original little knowledge will be far from enough to adapt to the development of the situation and the ever-changing reality.

    Some people think that agricultural production is simple, especially that physical labor is simple, and there is not much "knowledge" in it. According to my experience, this view is completely wrong. Agricultural production has a lot of knowledge. Physical labor not only requires strength, but also requires skill, technology, and science. When I first returned to my hometown after graduating from junior high school to participate in agricultural labor, although I had determination and enthusiasm, because I did not know agricultural production skills, I was sweating all over every day, but my labor efficiency was very low. With the help of the old farmers, I learned agricultural production operation techniques.

    In participating in agricultural labor, I gradually realized this: the experience accumulated by the old farmers in long-term practice is extraordinarily rich and precious. Once, when I was experimenting with cold frame seedling cultivation, a spring frost suddenly came, and the two-inch-long rice seedlings were about to freeze to death. At that time, I was very anxious, but I was at a loss. Just then, an old farmer came. He said to me: "Genze, you hurry up and irrigate with cold water!" I asked him suspiciously: "Pouring cold water on the frozen seedlings, wouldn't it freeze them even more?" "No, it won't!" The old farmer continued to explain his experience and simple reasoning. Sure enough, irrigating with cold water saved the rice seedlings. The following year, we encountered another spring snow (we often have such frost and snow attacks in the northern rice growing areas). According to the previous experience, all the seedbeds in the village were filled with cold water, which saved the rice seedlings and guaranteed a good harvest. In this way, the terrible spring frost and spring snow could no longer cause disasters from that year onwards.

    In addition to humbly learning from the old farmers in production practice, I also often study book knowledge, especially to improve my political, cultural, scientific and technological level, and first study cultural knowledge. In my more than ten years of rural life, I have been participating in agricultural labor while actively using all my spare time to conduct various studies. Now, although I have mastered Chinese, Chinese and other languages and advanced agricultural scientific theoretical knowledge, and have reached the level of university graduation, I must not be complacent because of this. Pride makes people lag behind, and modesty makes people progress. In fact, there are still many problems in agricultural science that need people to explore and solve. Only by not being complacent can we continue to move forward and adapt to the development of the situation.

    Under the great call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao for the whole party and the whole people to run agriculture and grain production in a big way, I happily returned to my hometown—the Hailan River. In the future, I am determined to continue to persist in learning, learning from the old farmers, and actively imparting the agricultural science and technology I have learned under the care of the Party to the broad masses of farmers, climbing the peak of agricultural science, and striving to be a new type of farmer with high political consciousness, cultural technology, and love of labor.

    还要不断学习
    吉林延吉东盛人民公社海兰生产队　吕根泽
    我原是个学生，从学校出来，就自愿到农村参加农业劳动。我在参加农业劳动中，深深感到自己虽然读过几年书，但一接触实际，这些书本知识就很不够用了。因为今天我们的农村人民公社在党和毛主席的英明领导下，正一日千里地发展着，如果不经常地在实际生活中和生产斗争中努力学习，我们原有的一点点知识就远远不能适应形势的发展和日新月异变化着的现实。
    有些人认为农业生产简单，特别认为体力劳动简单，内中没有多大“学问”。根据我的体会，这种看法是完全错误的，农业生产大有学问，体力劳动不仅要靠气力，也需要巧劲，需要技术，需要科学。当我刚从初中毕业回乡参加农业劳动的时候，虽然有决心和热情，但是，因为不会农业生产本领，每天搞得全身大汗，可是劳动效率很低。经过老农的帮助，才学会了农业生产操作技术。
    我在参加农业劳动中，逐渐体会到这一点：老农民在长期实践中所积累的经验，是异常丰富、异常宝贵的。有一次，我正在试验冷床育苗的时候，突然袭来春霜，二寸多长的稻苗快要冻死了。那个时候我很急躁，可是束手无策。正在这个时候，一位老农也来到了。他对我说：“根泽呀，你赶快灌冷水吧！”我怀疑地向他反问：“往冻僵的小苗上灌冷水，岂不更冻坏了吗？”“不，不会！”老农继续说明了自己的经验和简单的道理。果然，灌冷水后就把稻苗救过来了。第二年又遇到一次春雪（我们北方水稻栽培区常常有这样的霜雪的袭击），按着上次的经验把全村的苗床里全部灌冷水，救了稻苗，保证了丰收。这样，可怕的春霜、春雪从这一年起再也不能造成灾害了。
    除了在生产实践中向老农们虚心学习外，我还经常学习书本知识，特别是为提高自己的政治、文化、科学技术水平，首先学习文化知识。我在十多年的农村生活中，一边参加农业劳动，一边积极利用一切业余时间进行了各种学习。现在我虽然已经掌握了汉语、汉文等语言文字和高等农业科学理论知识，达到了大学毕业水平，但是我决不能因此而自满，骄傲使人落后，谦虚使人进步，实际上，农业科学里还有很多问题需要人们去探索、解决。只有不自满，才能使自己不断前进，适应形势的发展。
    在党中央和毛主席提出全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的伟大号召下，我高高兴兴地回到了家乡——海兰江畔。今后，我决心继续坚持学习，向老农学习，向广大农民群众积极传授我在党的关怀下所学得的农业科学技术，攀登农业科学高峰，努力做一个有高度政治觉悟，有文化技术，热爱劳动的新型农民。
