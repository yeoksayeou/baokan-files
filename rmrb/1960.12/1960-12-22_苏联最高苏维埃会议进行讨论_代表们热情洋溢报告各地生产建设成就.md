Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 21st: According to TASS, the Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting continued today to discuss the draft of the 1961 Soviet National Economic Development Plan and the draft of the 1961 Soviet National Budget, as well as the report on the implementation of the 1959 National Budget.

　　At the meetings of the Union Council and the National Council held separately on the morning of the 21st, a total of twenty-three representatives spoke.

　　Soviet Supreme Soviet representative and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijan Republic, Mammad Abdul ogly Iskenderov, emphasized in his speech that, based on the further development of oil and gas extraction in Soviet Azerbaijan next year, the production of chemical products in the third year of the Seven-Year Plan will increase by 41%. He said that the republic will obtain 650,000 tons more oil and 660 million cubic meters more gas in 1961 than this year.

　　Iskenderov spoke about the development of capital construction in the republic. He also mentioned the oil pipeline project that has started construction, which will pass through the bottom of the Caspian Sea and connect the largest offshore oil field with Baku.

　　Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation, Vasily Moskovsky, spoke about the cultural development of the Russian Federation. He said that in another two years, the Russian Federation will complete the transition to universal eight-year education. Moskovsky pointed out that this will be an important part of the plan to implement communist education for young people in the Soviet Union.

　　He said that we intend to establish film projection stations in every village and town with no less than fifty residences throughout the vast territory of the republic (which is almost one and a half times the size of the entire Europe). He added that the republic now has more than 70,000 cultural palaces and libraries each, with a total collection of nearly 500 million books.

　　Soviet Supreme Soviet representative and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Tajik Republic, Dodokhudoyev, said that the Nurek Hydropower Station on the Vakhsh River, with a power generation capacity of 2.7 million kilowatts, which will begin construction in 1961, is the power heart of Central Asia. When this power station is put into production, it will play a revolutionary role in changing the economic landscape of the republic; it will start an era of developing chemical, metallurgical, electrical engineering, and other industrial sectors.

　　He said that the establishment of the huge reservoir of the Nurek power station will make it possible to reclaim new planting areas, double the production of cotton, especially fine-staple cotton, and increase the total cotton harvest to one million tons.

　　Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Moscow City Soviet of Working People's Deputies, Bobrovnikov, said that Moscow should become the most beautiful and well-equipped capital in the world, which is the purpose of the city's ongoing reconstruction. He said that the city's area has expanded sevenfold, and the city's population has approached seven million. Moscow will continue to build houses at a fast pace, and it is expected that 116,000 new houses will be delivered next year, which is much more than the houses built this year.

　　Secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, Solovyov, spoke about the growth of the welfare of the Soviet people. He particularly pointed out that the Soviet Union's pension appropriations in 1961 will be 8.7% more than this year.

　　Solovyov pointed out that in the Soviet Union, all citizens who are fifty for men and sixty for women years old can receive a pension regardless of the nature of their work; while in the United States, the age for receiving a pension is sixty-five; and in Sweden and Canada, it is sixty-seven to seventy.

　　The meeting will continue its discussions in the evening.

    苏联最高苏维埃会议进行讨论
    代表们热情洋溢报告各地生产建设成就
    新华社莫斯科21日电　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃会议今天继续讨论1961年苏联发展国民经济计划草案和1961年苏联国家预算草案，以及关于1959年国家预算执行情况的报告。
    在联盟院和民族院两院于21日上午分别举行的会议上，共有二十三名代表发言。
    苏联最高苏维埃代表、阿塞拜疆共和国部长会议主席马麦德·阿卜杜勒·奥格雷·伊斯肯杰罗夫在发言时强调指出，苏维埃阿塞拜疆在明年石油和瓦斯的开采将获得进一步发展的基础上，七年计划第三年的化学产品的生产将增加41％。他说，共和国在1961年要比今年多获得六十五万吨石油、六亿六千万立方米瓦斯。
    伊斯肯杰罗夫谈到了共和国基本建设的发展。他还谈到已经开始兴工的石油管工程，这条石油管将经过里海海底，把最大的海上采油场同巴库衔接起来。
    俄罗斯联邦部长会议副主席瓦西里·莫斯科夫斯基谈到俄罗斯联邦的文化发展。他说，再过两年，俄罗斯联邦将完成向普及八年制教育的过渡。莫斯科夫斯基指出，这将是执行在苏联实行的对青年共产主义教育的计划的重要部分之一。
    他说，我们打算在共和国（它的面积差不多为整个欧洲的一倍半）的整个广阔土地上，在不少于五十所住宅的每一村镇中建立电影放映站。他又说，现在，共和国的文化宫和图书馆各有七万个以上，它们的藏书量约近五亿册。
    苏联最高苏维埃代表、塔吉克共和国部长会议主席多胡多耶夫说，1961年将在瓦赫什河上开始兴建的、发电能力为二百七十万瓩的努列克水电站是中亚细亚的动力心脏。这个电站投入生产时将在改变共和国经济面貌方面起着革命作用；将开始一个发展化学、冶金、电工和其他工业部门的时代。
    他说，建立努列克电站巨大水库，将使得有可能开垦新的播种面积，使棉花的生产，特别是细纤维棉花的生产增加一倍，棉花的总收获量将增加到一百万吨。
    莫斯科市劳动人民代表苏维埃执行委员会主席波布罗夫尼科夫说，莫斯科要成为世界上最美丽的、设备最完善的首都，这就是这个城市正在进行的改建的目的。他说，城市的范围扩大了七倍，城市人口已接近七百万人。莫斯科仍将以快速度进行住宅建设，预计明年将有十一万六千套新住宅交付使用，这大大多于今年建成的住宅。
    全苏工会中央理事会书记索洛维耶夫在发言中，谈到苏联人民福利的增长情况。他特别指出，1961年苏联抚恤金拨款将比今年多8.7％。
    索洛维耶夫指出，在苏联，凡年满五十一六十岁的公民，不分工作性质，都可以领取养老金；而在美国，领养老金的年龄规定为六十五岁；在瑞典和加拿大则为六十七一七十岁。
    晚间，会议将继续进行讨论。
