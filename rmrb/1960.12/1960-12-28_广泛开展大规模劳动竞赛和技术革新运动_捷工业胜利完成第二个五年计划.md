Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 25th: (By Our Correspondent) Czechoslovak industry has victoriously completed its Second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960) this year. Thanks to the selfless labor of the broad masses of workers and staff, the task of the Five-Year Plan for total industrial output value was completed ahead of schedule in April this year. By the end of this year, its industrial production level will have increased fourfold compared to 1937 before liberation. This is another significant victory for the Czechoslovak people in their socialist construction.

According to the latest estimates, Czechoslovak industrial production this year will increase by 65% compared to 1955, significantly exceeding the planned target of a 54% increase. Over these five years, average annual industrial production growth has been 10.5%, equivalent to five times the industrial growth rate of Czechoslovakia during the capitalist era. Many important industrial sectors have achieved significant development.

The production of the machine manufacturing industry, the key development sector of the Five-Year Plan, has developed most rapidly. It has greatly exceeded the planned target of a 77% increase, reaching over 90%. Currently, the total output value of the Czechoslovak machine industry has increased to six times that of the pre-war period.

In the past five years, Czechoslovakia's power industry has also developed rapidly. According to preliminary estimates, hard coal production will exceed the plan by 300,000 tons and coke by 400,000 tons in the five years. The level of mechanization in coal mining has also been further improved. Due to the development of coal production, Czechoslovakia has successfully reversed the past situation where the coal industry lagged behind the development of the national economy, starting this year. In terms of the electric power industry, the total national power generation is expected to reach 24.4 billion kilowatt-hours this year. Due to the continuous increase in electricity production, the national electrification plan adopted by the National Conference of the Czechoslovak Communist Party in June 1956 was completed four months ahead of schedule in early September this year. Currently, 99% of the country's residents have access to electricity, and more than 99% of the country's rural areas have been electrified, except for a very small number of remote areas.

The metallurgical industry has also achieved tremendous development during the Second Five-Year Plan. This year's steel production will increase from 4.88 million tons in 1956 to 6.8 million tons; the per capita steel production will reach about 500 kilograms. As early as 1959, Czechoslovakia's per capita steel production had already exceeded the level of capitalist countries such as Britain, France, and Sweden; if it continues to develop at the current rate, Czechoslovakia will surpass the level of the United States and West Germany in a few years.

The past five years have been a period of large-scale capital construction in Czechoslovakia. During this period, the total amount of capital construction nationwide will exceed the planned target of a 70% increase, reaching about 80%. Many new factories, mines, and equipment have been successively completed and put into production. For example, in the steel industry, two new blast furnaces, seven open-hearth furnaces, and four coke ovens have been built this year alone.

During the Five-Year Plan, the broad masses of workers in Czechoslovakia launched large-scale labor emulation drives and technical innovation campaigns. The highest form of labor emulation—the "Socialist Labor Brigade" movement—is unfolding in various places, becoming an important force in promoting the continuous development of production. Although this movement has only been around for two years, to date, 31,000 labor brigades have participated in the movement. In many enterprises, entire production lines, entire workshops, and even entire factories have participated in this movement.

    广泛开展大规模劳动竞赛和技术革新运动
    捷工业胜利完成第二个五年计划
    新华社布拉格25日电　本社记者报道：今年捷克斯洛伐克工业已经胜利地完成了第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）。由于广大职工的忘我劳动，五年计划规定的工业总产值的任务早在今年4月底就提前完成了。到今年年底，它的工业生产水平就增长为解放前1937年的四倍。这是捷克斯洛伐克人民在社会主义建设中取得的又一个重大的胜利。
    根据最新估计，今年捷克斯洛伐克工业生产将比1955年提高65％，大大超过计划所规定的提高54％的指标。在这五年中，每年工业生产平均增长10.5％，相当于资本主义时代捷克斯洛伐克工业增长速度的五倍。许多重要的工业部门都获得了长足的发展。
    五年计划的重点发展部门——机器制造业的生产发展得最为迅速。它大大突破了计划规定增长77％的指标，而达到90％以上。目前，捷克斯洛伐克机器工业的总产值已增加为战前的六倍。
    五年来，捷克斯洛伐克动力工业的发展也很快。据初步估计，五年中硬煤将超计划生产三十万吨，焦炭——四十万吨。采煤工作的机械化水平也进一步提高了。由于煤炭生产的发展，从今年开始，捷克斯洛伐克已经成功地扭转了过去煤炭工业跟不上国民经济发展的状况。在电力工业方面，今年全国总发电量预计可达二百四十四亿度。由于电力生产的不断提高，1956年6月捷共全国代表会议所通过的全国电气化计划，已经在今年9月初提前四个月完成。目前，全国99％的居民都得到了电力供应，除极少数边远地区外，全国99％以上的农村都实现了电气化。
    冶金工业在第二个五年计划期间也取得了巨大的发展。今年的钢产量将从1956年的四百八十八万吨增加到六百八十万吨；按人口平均计算每人可达五百公斤左右。早在1959年，捷克斯洛伐克按人口平均计算的钢产量就已超过了英国、法国和瑞典等资本主义国家的水平；如按目前速度继续发展，几年后捷克斯洛伐克就将超过美国和西德的水平。
    过去五年是捷克斯洛伐克大规模进行基本建设的时期。在这期间，全国的基本建设总量将突破计划规定的增长70％的指标而达到80％左右。许多新的厂矿企业和设备相继建成并投入生产。例如，在钢铁工业方面，单在今年，就新建成了二座高炉、七座平炉和四座炼焦炉。
    在五年计划期间，捷克斯洛伐克广大的工人群众展开了规模巨大的劳动竞赛和技术革新运动。劳动竞赛的最高形式——“社会主义劳动队”运动正在各地展开，成为推动生产不断向前发展的一个重要力量。虽然这一运动从开始到现在还只有两年历史，但到目前为止，参加这个运动的劳动队已达三万一千个。在不少企业中，整条作业线、整个车间、甚至整个工厂都参加了这一运动。
