    Why does cement harden in water?
    Xia Junhui

    We often see construction workers constantly watering cement that hasn't dried, and freshly plastered cement is covered with wet straw bags. What is the reason for this? It is mainly to prevent the evaporation of water.

    To harden a substance, it is generally dried; the faster it dries, the harder it becomes. However, cement needs to be in water to harden. This is because the cement commonly used in construction is a type of silicate cement, which is made by sintering limestone and clay into clinker at high temperatures, then adding a small amount of gypsum, and grinding it into a powder to become silicate cement for construction use.

    Cement burning is a chemical change; limestone and clay at high temperatures turn into a mixture of four compounds: tricalcium silicate, dicalcium silicate, tricalcium aluminate, and tetracalcium aluminoferrite. They can all undergo chemical changes with water, called hydration, and the products are called hydrates. When cement is mixed with water, it becomes a gel. Water cannot dissolve the particles of this gel, and they have extremely strong attraction to each other, which can resist the water's dissociation. They move closer and closer, gradually expelling water molecules from the gaps between them. The closer their distance, the greater the density and the higher the hardness of the cement.

    However, cement particles are composed of many molecules. The molecules on the outer membrane of the particles are hydrated first, and the hydration of the molecules inside the particles gradually occurs. Watering freshly plastered cement not only does not affect the cohesion of already hydrated molecules but also promotes the hydration of molecules inside the particles. Therefore, freshly plastered cement needs to be kept moist for a longer time. The more hydrates are formed, the tighter the cement molecules bind together, the higher its hardness, and the more solid the building becomes. Conversely, if most of the molecules inside the particles do not undergo hydration, the surface-hydrated particles will loosen, and the cement will crack.

    Thus, we can easily understand why cement hardens even when immersed in water for a long time, and does not become loose.

    为什么水泥在水中会变硬？
    夏俊辉
    我们常看到，建筑工人经常不断地向没干的水泥上浇水，刚刷好的水泥，上面也盖上湿漉漉的草包，这是什么原因呢？主要是为了防止水的蒸发。
    要使物质变硬，一般都是让它干燥，干燥越快，硬度越硬。可是水泥却要在水中才能变硬。因为，建筑上常用的水泥，是一种硅酸盐土泥，它是用石灰石和粘土在高温下烧结成熔块，再加入少量的石膏，经研磨成粉末状成为建筑上用的硅酸盐水泥。
    烧水泥是一种化学变化，石灰石与粘土在高温下就变成了硅酸三钙、硅酸二钙、铝酸三钙与铝铁酸四钙四种化合物的混合物。它们都能与水起化学变化，称为水化，生成物叫水化物。水泥和水混合后，就成为一种凝胶体。水不能溶解这种凝胶体的颗粒，它们彼此间有极强的吸引力，可以抗击水对它们的离解。并且距离越来越靠拢，把水分子逐渐排出于它们彼此间的空隙中，它们的距离越近，水泥的密度就越大，硬度也越高。
    但是，水泥的颗粒是由很多个分子组成的。首先被水化的是颗粒外膜的分子，颗粒内部的分子发生水化也是逐渐进行的。刚刷好的水泥浇水，不但不影响已经水化的分子的凝聚，还会促使颗粒内部的分子水化，所以，要使刚刚刷好的水泥，较长时间保持湿漉漉的。水化物生成得越多，水泥的分子结聚得越紧密，其硬度也越高，建筑物就越结实牢固。反之，如果大部分颗粒内部的分子不进行水化，那么表面水化的颗粒，一旦松开，水泥就会裂开。
    这样，我们也就不难理解水泥为什么长期浸泡在水里也会变硬，而不会松散的原因了。
