This newspaper, Taiyuan, 30th - The Yanjiaping Management Area (basic accounting unit) of Baizi People's Commune in Qinshui County, Shanxi Province, has created the experience of "Knowing the Whole Year's Life Arrangements in Advance" by season, month, week, and day. By using this method, the whole year's life for commune members is planned, ensuring they eat their fill, eat well, and eat frugally, which promotes production. It also saves more surplus grain to sell to the state to support disaster areas. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has called on all regions to widely learn from this experience.

All commune members of the Yanjiaping Management Area overcame the historically rare drought this year, and grain production increased by 20% compared to last year. The Party branch promptly conducted in-depth ideological education among the masses, making everyone realize that in the case of increased production, they should be frugal and thrifty, live well but live like they're poor, implement planned grain use, conserve grain, support the country, and support disaster areas. Then, through concrete accounting, the seeds and fodder needed for next year's production and the commune members' rations were all itemized and implemented. The Party branch promptly organized commune members to further discuss how to eat, letting everyone offer suggestions. Based on democratic discussions, and according to the changes in the agricultural season and the principle of combining work and rest, the "Knowing the Whole Year's Life Arrangements in Advance" was formulated.

The specific approach of "Knowing the Whole Year's Life Arrangements in Advance" is: with running the canteen well as the center, all the commune members' rations and harvested vegetables are weighed and put into storage, under the unified management of the canteen; a plan for the whole year's grain usage is set, with more food during busy farming seasons and less during slack seasons, with a reasonable combination of grain and vegetables; at the same time, detailed arrangements are made for the grain and vegetables needed for the sick, the elderly, children, pregnant women, visiting relatives and friends, and festivals.

They also detailed the different grain usage standards and the proportion of edible vegetables by season, month, week, and day. More grain is eaten during the busy farming season, and less grain is eaten during the slack season. Within each season, the different characteristics of each month are also taken into account, and during busy periods, the grain usage standards vary. On the basis of the long-term plan by season and month, a "Clever Matching" table of meals for the week is also formulated each week according to the production plan of the management area and the production team. The content includes: how much grain and vegetables are needed, the proportion of various foods such as coarse grains, refined grains, and vegetables and the average amount per person are determined according to the intensity of the farm work; what to eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, how much oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar to use, ...; all of these are announced daily and earnestly fulfilled.

In the matching of grain varieties, both the living habits of the masses and the combination of work and rest are taken into account. During the Spring Festival, Lantern Festival, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and anniversaries such as "July 1st," "August 1st," "National Day," and New Year's Day, life is appropriately improved. For example, although January is a slack farming season, there are two major festivals: the Spring Festival and the Lantern Festival. Therefore, fine grains such as wheat, naked oats, and buckwheat account for 46% of the total month; fine vegetables such as cabbage and radish account for 97% of the total monthly vegetable usage. In this way, the life arrangements are truly made with a long-term plan and short-term arrangements, adapting to the needs of production.

In order to ensure the realization of "Knowing the Whole Year's Life Arrangements in Advance," the Party branch has taken many guarantee measures: 1. Five commune members with good ideology, great drive, and planning skills were selected to serve as cooks. 2. A "Four Clevers" life meeting is held every seven days, in which the deputy secretary of the branch convenes four types of people – clever mothers, clever wives, models of clever living, and clever chefs – to help the canteen come up with ideas and study the week's meal patterns. 3. The system of setting quotas per person, assigning targets to households, delivering grain to the dining hall, eating with tickets, and returning savings to oneself is adhered to. 4. The usage of grain and vegetables is checked and calculated weekly and monthly, and problems are solved immediately.

As the experience of "Knowing the Whole Year's Life Arrangements in Advance" is earnestly implemented in the Yanjiaping Management Area, the commune members no longer have to worry about life, and everyone can concentrate on production wholeheartedly.

    精打细算计划用粮  结合生产安排生活
    燕家坪管理区实行“一年生活安排早知道”
    全年用粮用菜逐季逐月逐日安排到底社员无需操心生活一心一意搞好生产
    本报太原30日电　山西省沁源县柏子人民公社燕家坪管理区（基本核算单位）创造了分季、分月、逐周、逐日“一年生活安排早知道”的经验。运用这种办法，把社员全年的生活有计划地安排好，既保证了社员吃饱、吃好、吃省，促进了生产；又能节省更多的余粮卖给国家，支援灾区。中共山西省委要求各地普遍学习这个经验。
    燕家坪管理区全体社员，今年战胜了历史上稀有的旱灾，粮食比去年增产两成。党支部及时在群众中进行了深入的思想教育，使大家认识到：在增产的情况下，应该省吃俭用，把富日子当穷日子过，实行计划用粮、节约用粮，支援国家，支援灾区。然后经过具体算账，把下年生产所需的种籽、饲料和社员口粮都项项落了实。党支部及时组织社员进一步讨论了如何吃法，让大家献策献计。在民主讨论的基础上，根据农事季节的变化和劳逸结合的原则，制订出“一年生活安排早知道”。
    “一年生活安排早知道”的具体做法是：以办好食堂为中心，把社员的口粮和收获的蔬菜，全部过称入库，由食堂统一管理；订出全年用粮计划，农忙多吃，农闲少吃，粮菜合理搭配；同时，对病人、老人、幼儿、产妇、来往亲友及过年过节等所需的粮菜，也都作出细致的安排。
    他们还分季、分月、逐周、逐日，详细地确定了不同的用粮标准和食用蔬菜的比例。农忙季节多吃粮，农闲季节少吃粮。在每季中又照顾了每月的不同特点，忙时期，用粮标准各有高底。在分季、分月长计划的基础上还逐周根据管理区和生产队的生产计划，制订出了一周饭菜“巧搭配”表，内容包括：需要多少粮和菜，根据农活的轻重，确定了粗粮、细粮、蔬菜等各种食物的搭配比例和每人的平均用量；早、午、晚吃什么，油、盐、酱、醋，各用多少，……；这些都做到了逐日公布，切实兑现。
    在粮食品种的搭配上，既注意了群众的生活习惯，又照顾了劳逸结合。每逢春节、元宵、端阳、中秋和“七一”、“八一”、“国庆”、新年等纪念节日，都要适当改善生活。如正月虽然是农闲的时候，但有春节和元宵两个大节令，因此全月小麦、莜麦、荞麦等细粮占46％；白菜、萝卜等细菜占全月用菜的97％。这样使生活安排真正做到了长计划短安排，适应了生产的需要。
    党支部为了使“一年生活安排早知道”得以实现，又采取了许多保证措施：一、选拔了思想好、干劲大、会计划的五个社员担任了炊事员。二、七天开一次“四巧”生活会，即由支部副书记召集巧大娘、巧媳妇、巧过日子的模范和巧厨师四种人，帮助食堂出主意，研究一周的饭菜花样。三、坚持推行了以人定量、指标到户、粮食到堂、凭票吃饭、节约归己的制度。四、逐周、逐月检查计算粮食、蔬菜的用量，发现问题，立即解决。
    燕家坪管理区随着“一年生活安排早知道”经验的认真执行，社员们不用操心生活了，大家就一心一意搞好生产。
