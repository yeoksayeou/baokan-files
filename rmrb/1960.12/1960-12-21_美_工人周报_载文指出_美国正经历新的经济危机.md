U.S. "Workers' Weekly" Carries Article Pointing Out
The United States is Experiencing a New Economic Crisis
Layoffs Expand to All Sectors of the Economy; Steel Industry Operating Rate Drops to Lowest Point This Year; Auto Inventory Reaches Unprecedented Peak

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch from New York: The American *Workers Weekly* published an article by Morris on the 11th, which pointed out that the American economy is experiencing a new crisis. The article wrote: "Even Schmidt, an economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce who is usually optimistic, admits that the United States is experiencing a 'mild readjustment,' and that the situation will continue to worsen for at least six months. This is an admission from a figure known for turning a blind eye to the developing recession."

The article cited a survey by the U.S. Department of Labor of 150 large industrial areas, saying: "Another nine areas have been listed as areas with 'substantial' unemployment (i.e., unemployment accounting for more than 6% of the workforce), bringing the total number of such areas to 51, compared to 32 a year ago. But even more importantly, the survey report shows that 'more than nine-tenths of the areas surveyed expect employment to decline again between mid-November and mid-January.' It is expected that a new wave of layoffs will occur after the seasonal sharp decline in the construction industry and the decline in trade and industry after Christmas."

The article pointed out that layoffs have spread to all sectors of the economy. Philco will lay off 1,000 workers at its television factory in Philadelphia. The New York Shipbuilding Corporation in Camden, New Jersey, will lay off 3,000 workers in February due to a lack of new shipbuilding orders; Douglas Aircraft Company will lay off 1,600 workers at its Long Beach factory, accounting for 12% of its workforce, due to a reduction in orders for DC-8 aircraft.

The article emphasized: "The steel industry operating rate has fallen again to 49.3%, the lowest point this year. The United Steelworkers of America says that the number of unemployed in the basic steel industry is 90,000, and the number of people working less than a full workweek is about twice that number.

"In the automobile industry, which consumes about one-fifth of U.S. steel production, unsold cars reached an unprecedented peak of 1.1 million on December 1. Many factories have already experienced insufficient weekly operating hours or partial layoffs."

The article said: "A survey conducted by the National Association of Purchasing Agents among its members found that it is now widely believed that this year will end in recession. Most purchasers say that the orders they have received have been declining."

The article concluded by pointing out that President-elect Kennedy and those around him are already uneasy about the economic situation in the United States, and have appointed a committee to study "the situation in depressed areas" "in order to take action on this issue when Congress convenes." However, the article pointed out: "Any new plans the new government may think of will be too late, and the full impact of the recession is already being felt."

    美“工人周报”载文指出
    美国正经历新的经济危机
    解雇扩及经济各部门；钢铁工业开工率降到今年最低点；汽车滞销量达空前最高峰
    新华社讯　纽约消息：美国《工人周报》11日刊载了摩里斯的一篇文章，文章指出，美国的经济正在经历着一次新的危机。文章写道：“连一向抱乐观态度的美国商会的经济学家施密特也承认，美国正在经历‘温和的重新调整’，而且情况将继续恶化至少达六个月之久。这是一个以闭眼不看发展中的衰退而著名的人物的招认。”
    文章援引美国劳工部对一百五十个大工业地区的调查结果说：“又有九个地区被列为失业人数‘众多’的地区（即失业人数占劳动力的6％以上），从而使这种地区的总数增为五十一个，而一年前是三十二个。但是，甚至更为重要的是，调查报告表明，
  ‘经调查的地区有十分之九以上预料在11月中旬到1月中旬就业人数将再度下降’。预料，在建筑业的季节性大量下降以及在圣诞节后贸易和工业的下降以后将出现新的解雇浪潮。”
    文章指出，解雇已经蔓延到经济的各个部门。飞歌公司在费城的电视工厂将解雇工人一千名。新泽西州坎登地方的纽约造船公司由于没有新的造船订货，将在2月解雇三千名工人；道格拉斯飞机公司在长滩的工厂由于DC——8飞机的订货减少，将解雇工人一千六百名，占工人总数的12％。
    文章着重指出：“钢铁工业开工率再度下降到49.3％，这是今年的最低点。联合钢铁工人工会说，基本钢铁业的失业人数为九万人，每周工作量不足的人数比这个数字大约还要增加一倍。
    “在消耗美国钢产量约五分之一的汽车工业中，没有销出的汽车在12月1日达到一百一十万辆的空前高峰。许多工厂已经遇到每周开工不足的情况或进行部分解雇。”
    文章说：“全国采购代理商协会对它的会员进行的调查发现，目前人们普遍认为，今年将以衰退告终。大多数采购商说，他们收到的订货一直在下降。”
    文章最后指出，当选总统肯尼迪及其周围的人对美国的经济情况已经感到不安，并且已经任命一个委员会来研究“萧条地区的情况”，“以便在国会开会时对这个问题采取行动”。但是，文章指出：“新政府可能想到的新计划都会过迟，衰退的全部影响已经感觉出来。”
