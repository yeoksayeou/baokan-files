    To Coal Miners
    The year 1960, a year of continued leap forward, is about to pass, and a new year is about to begin. After successfully achieving this year's production results, the coal miners across the country are about to start on a new starting point and strive to better complete their production tasks in the new year.
    Time is coal. For coal miners, cherishing every minute and second, increasing coal production, and emitting more light and heat is of great significance to the country's construction.
    According to the current production situation, employees of the national coal sector will implement a rotation system during the New Year's Day and Spring Festival holidays, maintaining normal production, which can increase the country's coal production by about two million tons. Without detailed explanation, the number itself is enough to illustrate how important and meaningful it is. The hard work of coal miners for a few days can have a significant impact on the entire production and construction endeavor. What a glorious and great action this is!
    Coal is the grain of the industrial front. In industrial production, metallurgy, mechanical casting, power generation, and chemicals are inseparable from coal; trains and ships in transportation also need coal as fuel; the degree of mechanization in agricultural production has increased, the number of agricultural product processing projects has increased, and people's use of coal has also increased, so the demand for coal has also increased accordingly. How can the vast number of employees on the coal front catch up with this situation and make greater contributions to large-scale agriculture and large-scale grain production? Continuing to carry forward the glorious tradition of hard work among employees, making full use of the New Year's Day and Spring Festival holidays, and adopting a rotation system to stick to production posts and continue production as usual is one way. Since the Great Leap Forward, every New Year's Day and Spring Festival, China's coal miners have adopted a new routine of mutual rotation to replace the old routine. This is a good way to combine national interests with individual interests.
    Originally, New Year's Day and Spring Festival holidays do not necessarily have to be mechanically concentrated on these few days; especially for important production departments like the coal industry, it is even more important to arrange their rest from the perspective of the needs of the entire production. All coal mine employees have already done this. Your awareness and communist style deserve everyone's respect and learning.
    Leaders of industrial and mining enterprises, especially comrades of the mining area Party committees, should pay attention: the greater the enthusiasm of the coal miners, the more the leaders of the mining area must earnestly and properly arrange their lives to ensure that employees are well-fed and well-rested. Railway workers related to coal production must ensure that they do a good job in coal transportation during the holidays. Electricity workers need to do a good job in supplying electricity for coal mines during holiday production.
    Coal miners across the country! The new year is about to begin. As you stride towards a new journey, we warmly wish you step-by-step victories!

### 给煤矿工人

    给煤矿工人
    继续跃进的1960年即将过去，新的一年就要开始了。全国煤矿工人们胜利地取得了今年的生产成绩以后，又要在新的起点上迈开步伐，为在新的一年中更好地完成生产任务而奋斗。
    时间，就是煤炭。对于煤矿工人来说，珍惜一分一秒的时间，增产更多的煤炭，发出更多的光和热，对国家建设事业的贡献有着重大的意义。
    根据目前的生产情况，全国煤炭部门的职工，在元旦和春节期间实行轮休制，保持照常生产，约可以为国家增产两百万吨左右的煤炭。用不着详细解释，仅仅这个数目字本身，就可以说明它是十分重要和十分有意义的。煤矿工人几天辛劳，对整个生产建设事业，却能发生重大作用，这是多么光荣多么伟大的行动啊！
    煤炭是工业战线上的粮食。工业生产中的冶金、机械铸造、发电、化工固然离不开煤炭；交通运输中的火车、轮船也需要煤炭作燃料；农业生产中机械化的程度提高，农产品的加工项目增多，人民生活用煤也增加了，因而对煤炭需要量也相应地增加了。煤炭战线上广大职工怎样才能赶上这个形势，为大办农业、大办粮食作出更大的贡献呢？继续发扬职工们艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，充分利用元旦、春节假日，采取轮流休假的办法，坚守生产岗位，照常进行生产，就是办法之一。大跃进以来，每逢元旦、春节，我国煤矿工人采取了一套相互轮休的新常规代替了旧常规。这是一个把国家利益和个人利益结合起来的好办法。
    本来，元旦休假和春节休假，不一定机械地集中在这几天来进行；特别是像煤炭工业这样重要的生产部门更要从考虑整个生产的需要来安排自己的休息。全体煤矿职工现在已经这样做了，你们的这种自觉性，这种共产主义风格值得所有人尊敬和学习。
    工矿企业的领导者特别是矿区党委的同志们要注意：煤矿工人干劲越大，矿区领导上一定要切实妥善地安排他们的生活，保证职工们吃得饱休息好。和煤矿生产有关的铁路职工要保证做好节日期间的煤炭运输工作。电业职工需要作好对煤矿节日期间进行生产的电力供应工作。
    全国煤矿职工们！新的一年就要开始了。当你们迈开大步走向新的里程的时候，我们热情地预祝你们一步胜利，步步胜利！
