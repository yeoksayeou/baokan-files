    Azure Flames
    ——A Visit to Uzbekistan's Vasili
    By Our Correspondent Cui Yongchang

    "Azure Flames" is a nickname given to gas by the Soviet people. Currently, gas in the Soviet Union is not only used for cooking, but also as an important industrial fuel. In many factories and power plants, gas has already replaced coal.

    Not long ago, we visited Vasili in Uzbekistan, an important construction site of the Seven-Year Plan. A few years ago, this was an uninhabited desert area, but today, Vasili is famous throughout the Soviet Union. Geological exploration teams have found natural gas and oil here, drilling workers have erected derricks in the desert, and construction workers are building a brand-new village here. During our short visit to Vasili, we saw the heroic spirit of the Soviet people in conquering nature and their high level of labor enthusiasm.

    Shevchenko, the captain of the exploration team, said that the Soviet exploration team began to march here in 1954. At that time, there were many difficulties in carrying out exploration work in the desert. There was no water in Vasili, and the drinking and water use for the exploration team of more than one hundred people became a problem. The exploration team leader led everyone to find water sources nearby. A shepherd pointed them to a small river one hundred kilometers away. The shepherd also told them some myths circulating here. Local people say that they could see a strange phenomenon in the desert. At night, sometimes people would see clusters of flames, which locals called "ghost fires." In the wells of the residential areas, sometimes water would suddenly gush out of the ground and burn when it encountered fire, which people called "ghost water"... The exploration team leader was inspired by these legends and saw the gas and oil he needed to find.

    In the summer of 1954, large-scale drilling work began. Drilling rigs were erected in the desert. Soviet workers from Baku, Bashkir, and other places began their fight against nature. The harsh climate in the desert seemed to deliberately antagonize people. In the summer, the sun baked the desert like a hot pot, and the drilling parts were hot to the touch. In the coldest part of winter, the temperature dropped to minus twenty or thirty degrees, and the cold wind was biting. However, none of this could stop the workers' work. They persevered for two years, and finally found gas and oil in 1956.

    Petrov, a geological expert from the exploration team who personally participated in this work, gave us a detailed introduction to Vasili's treasures. He said that so far, the proven gas reserves are 500 billion cubic meters. This is one of the largest gas storage areas in the world. A series of drilling wells have already found gas that can be used as industrial fuel. He said that in four years, this place can produce 18 billion cubic meters of gas annually, equivalent to 45 million tons of coal. With so much gaseous fuel, the Central Asian republics can stop transporting coal from other places to here. In addition to self-use, Uzbekistan will also use gas to support the industry in the Urals. There are plans to build two of the world's longest gas pipelines, one 1,800 kilometers long, leading to Chelyabinsk, and the other 2,200 kilometers long, connecting Vasili with Sverdlovsk. Due to the discovery of Vasili's gas, great changes will take place in Uzbekistan's national economy: the chemical industry and power industry here will make great strides.

    Vasili is now a settlement with more than three thousand workers, a typical Soviet workers' village. There is a solidly built club, a cafeteria, and a shop. Loudspeakers are hung on the central square, broadcasting from Moscow. Men and women workers walk on the streets, and an asphalt road leads directly to Bukhara. Not long ago, underground hot springs were found here, and the workers built a hot spring bathhouse themselves. After people come here, they may sometimes forget that this is a village in the desert. Shatiyev, the secretary of the Vasili Party Committee, said that all of this is the result of the workers' four years of fighting the desert since 1956. Four years ago, this was a desert. Due to transportation difficulties, sometimes food could not be supplied, sometimes there was a lack of water, and at night, sleeping in tents, people had to guard against the "invasion" of wolves and the "theft" of lizards. However, the workers were not intimidated by the difficulties. They found underground treasures and built this workers' village. Now there are 160 houses here, each with electric lights and running water, and the workers can even bake their own bread.

    Petrov, a geological expert from the exploration team, took us to visit the workers' village. In the home of Ashrapov, a construction worker, we were warmly received by the host. Ashrapov is a young construction worker from Kazan. After coming to Vasili, he got married, settled down, and brought his mother here, determined to work here for a long time.

    Not far from Ashrapov's home, we also met Tabanov, a Kazakh drilling worker. He showed us the small vegetable garden he had opened up, where there were well-grown cabbages, potatoes, and tobacco. He said, "As long as there is water here, anything can grow."

    Twelve kilometers away from the workers' village, the car stopped in front of drilling well number 112. Gas and oil have already been found here. Next to the drilling well is a gas cylinder. The old man in charge of the drilling well, Alimuradov, told us that tests are being carried out here. On the other side, there is also a crude oil storage tank, and an iron pipe continuously sends the brownish-yellow crude oil from the drilling well.

    We turned eastward and saw a lake next to another drilling well. In the lake, there was a "fountain" that constantly threw water and mud into the sky. Comrade Petrov told us that this drilling well number 108 found gas. Because the gas layer was very close to the ground, when the drilling well drilled into the gas layer, the ground suddenly sank, forming a deep pit. Underground water gushed out from the pit, forming this "fountain." Now there is a work team working here, trying to block it.

    On the way back, we saw trucks carrying workers back to the workers' village from all directions. The songs and laughter of young people filled the desert village. Lights were lit in many houses. People ended their day's work and were resting happily, preparing to welcome a new battle tomorrow. (Attached picture)

### 蔚蓝色的火焰——访乌兹别克的瓦斯里

    蔚蓝色的火焰
    ——访乌兹别克的瓦斯里
    本报记者　崔永昌
    “蔚蓝色的火焰”是苏联人民给煤气取的一个别名。煤气目前在苏联不止用于煮饭烧菜，并且是一种重要的工业燃料，在许多工厂和火电站，煤气已经代替了煤炭。
    不久前，我们在乌兹别克访问了七年计划的一个重要工地——瓦斯里。几年前，这里还是一片没有人烟的沙漠地带，但是今天，瓦斯里已经闻名全苏。地质勘探队在这里找到了天然煤气与石油，钻探工人在沙漠中架起了一座座井架，建设工人在这里建设一座崭新的村落。在瓦斯里的短期访问中，我们看到了苏联人民征服自然的英雄气概，也看到他们高度的劳动热情。
    勘探队队长谢夫钦柯说，苏联勘探队是在1954年开始向这里进军的。那时，在沙漠中进行勘察工作有许多困难。瓦斯里当地没有水，勘探队一百多人的吃水和用水就发生了问题。勘探队队长带着大家在附近寻找水源。在一百公里以外的地方，一位牧羊人指给他们一条小河。牧人还给他们讲起了这里流传的一些神话。当地人民中间传说，在沙漠中可以看到一种奇怪的现象，夜里有时人们看到一团团火焰，当地人管它叫做“鬼火”；在居民点的水井里，有时水会突然冒出地面，并且遇火就燃烧起来，人们管它叫做“鬼水”……勘探队队长从这些传说中得到启发，看到自己需要找的煤气与石油。
    1954年夏天，大规模的钻探工作开始了。一座座钻井的架子在沙漠中架设起来。来自巴库、巴什基尔等地的苏联工人，开始了与自然界的斗争。沙漠中严峻的气候好像故意与人们作对。夏天，太阳把沙漠晒得像热锅一样，钻井的机件热得烫手。冬天最冷的时候，气温降到零下二、三十度，寒风刺骨。但是，这一切都不能阻止工人们的工作。他们就是这样坚持了两年，终于在1956年找到了煤气与石油。
    勘探队的地质专家彼特洛夫是亲自参加这项工作的，这位三十几岁的青年专家详细地向我们介绍了瓦斯里的宝藏。他说，到目前为止，已经勘探清楚的煤气储藏量是五千亿立方米。这是世界上最大的煤气储藏区之一，目前已经有一系列钻井找到了煤气可以作工业燃料之用。他说，四年后，这个地方每年可以生产一百八十亿立方米煤气，等于四千五百万吨煤。有了这样多的气体燃料，中亚各共和国就可以停止从外地向这里运煤。除去自用之外，乌兹别克还将用煤气支援乌拉尔的工业。现在正计划建设两条世界最长的煤气管，一条长一千八百公里，通到车里雅宾斯克，另外一条长二千二百公里，把瓦斯里与斯维德洛夫斯克联系起来。由于瓦斯里煤气的发现，在乌兹别克的国民经济将发生很大的变化：这里的化学工业、电力工业将大步前进。
    瓦斯里现在是一座有三千多工人的居民点，这是一座典型的苏联工人村。这里有建设得很结实的俱乐部，有食堂，有商店。中心广场上挂着扩音器，从里面传来莫斯科的广播。男女工人在街上行走，一条柏油路直通布哈拉。不久以前，这里找到了地下温泉，工人们自己动手盖了一个温泉浴场。人们来到这里以后，有时真可能忘掉这里是沙漠中的村落。瓦斯里党委书记沙蒂也夫说，所有这一切都是工人们在1956年以后用四年时间和沙漠斗争的成果。四年前这里是一片沙漠，因为运输困难，有时粮食供应不上，有时感到缺乏水，夜晚睡在帐篷里还要预防狼的“侵犯”和蜥蜴的“偷袭”。但是，工人们没有被困难吓倒，他们找到了地下宝藏，并且建设起这座工人村。现在这里有一百六十幢住房，每个房子里都有电灯和自来水，工人们还能够自己烤面包。
    勘探队的地质专家彼特洛夫带我们去参观工人村。在一位建筑工人阿施拉帕夫的家里，我们受到了主人热情的招待。阿施拉帕夫是来自卡赞的一位青年建筑工人，他来到瓦斯里以后，在这里结了婚，安了家，并且把自己的母亲也接了来，决心在这里长期工作下去。
    在离阿施拉帕夫家不远的地方，我们还遇到哈萨克族的一位钻探工人塔巴诺夫。他让我们参观了他开辟的小菜园，这里有生长得很好的白菜、土豆和烟草。他说：“这里的地只要有水，什么都可以长得出来。”
    在离工人村十二公里的地方，汽车在一百一十二号钻井前停下来。这里已经找到了煤气与石油，钻井旁边有一个煤气筒，看管钻井的老人艾里木拉多夫告诉我们，这里正在进行化验；另外一边还有一个原油储藏器，一个铁管子从钻井中不断把棕黄色的原油送出来。
    我们折向东方，在另外一口钻井旁边看到一个湖，湖中有个“喷泉”，不断地把水和泥抛向天空。彼特洛夫同志告诉我们，这个一百零八号钻井找到了煤气，因为煤气层距地面很近，钻井钻到煤气层时，地面忽然陷了下去，形成一个深坑，从坑内冒出了地下水，形成了这个“喷泉”。现在有一个工作队在这里工作，正想办法把它堵住。
    在回去的路上，我们看到一辆辆卡车把工人从四面八方载回工人村。青年人的歌声、笑声充满了这座沙漠中的村落。许多房屋中点起了灯火，人们结束了一天的劳动，正在愉快地休息，准备迎接明天新的战斗。（附图片）
