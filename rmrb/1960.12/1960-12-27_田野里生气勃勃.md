Fields Bursting with Vigor
\tSpecial Correspondent Ji Lifu, Our Correspondent Jiang Weicai

\tSome time ago, we paid a visit to the Matou People's Commune in the suburban area of Huaiyin City, northern Jiangsu. Stepping into the commune's land, we were greeted with a refreshing feeling everywhere.

\tIn the fields, everything was vibrant and full of life. The commune members, each with a ruddy complexion and full of energy, were engaged in winter activities with a balance of work and rest. In the idle winter fields, people swung their shovels, vigorously digging deep into the soil. "An inch deep in winter plowing is better than spreading manure." On the riverbanks and along the water's edge, waterwheels were set up, and young men quickly treaded on the wheels, accumulating fertilizer from the dry riverbeds. Many fields and deeply plowed winter fallow lands were already covered with piles of base fertilizer for next year's spring planting. The wheat seedlings, resembling green carpets, were even more endearing. Commune members managing the wheat fields were busy applying top dressing and digging ditches. In the villages, pigsties and sheepfolds were full, and flocks of chickens and ducks thrived. Winter sideline production activities such as fishing, weaving, and hunting were flourishing. All of this made it clear at a glance that the cadres and commune members here were preparing to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture next year.

The Loudspeaker Is No Longer Needed

\tOne day, the square in front of the Yuba Brigade office was filled with brightly dressed girls and neatly dressed elderly and young men, cheerfully talking about production and sharing family news. In the center of the square stood a smooth and shiny table, covered on three sides with red paper packets of various sizes, each neatly inscribed with the name of a commune member. The autumn settlement and distribution conference began. Captain Li Jinren, with a beaming smile, handed out the red paper packets from the table to the commune members, one by one, according to the order of the production teams and the names of the commune members. People received the red paper packets, their radiant faces filled with joyful smiles. After the distribution, 92% of the brigade members increased their income, and everyone received cash.

\tAfter the Third Team received an overproduction bonus, the cadres and members were even more motivated. That afternoon, they further reviewed measures to strive for even greater overproduction next year and deployed a small segment of winter fallow land for deep plowing. The next morning, team leader Wu Yanqing noticed that every household was quiet, with no one moving about. Wu Yanqing felt very strange. After waiting a while, he still saw no activity, so he picked up a loudspeaker to call out. Suddenly, a clear voice came from the fields: "Team Leader Wu, we're over here!" Wu Yanqing couldn't contain his inner joy and hurried to the field, where he saw that the members had already plowed more than forty yards of land.

\tWith such high labor enthusiasm, the land seemed to become softer. The team's task of deeply plowing more than eighty acres of winter fallow land was originally planned to be completed in three days, but it was finished in two and a half days.

Every Household Adds Small Farm Tools

\tRecently, the commune's farm tool factory's sales department has been particularly busy. The counter is often crowded with people buying manure baskets, manure scoops, and iron shovels, bustling with activity as they select and purchase. Comrades in the farm tool factory's sales department told us that in the forty days from November to December 10th this year, the sales department sold more than six thousand four hundred small farm tools such as manure baskets, manure scoops, iron shovels, manure buckets, and manure dippers, an increase of 67.5% compared to the same period last year. About 50% of the farmers in the commune have purchased small farm tools, and every household has added to their collection of small farm tools.

\tZhang Jinhua, an old commune member in his fifties from the First Production Team of the Hongqi Brigade, after receiving his autumn distribution of cash, gathered his whole family around the table that evening to discuss how to spend it. The grandmother said, "Make me a new jacket." As soon as she finished speaking, the eldest daughter, Yueying, eagerly wanted to make a corduroy jacket and buy a pair of sneakers. The two younger brothers clamored to buy rubber shoes. The old man said with a smile, "You can't just think about dressing up, you have to think about the team's production." The old man's words reminded everyone. The eldest daughter said, "I won't buy sneakers, buy me an iron shovel instead." The grandmother added, "I won't make a new jacket either, buy a piglet to raise." The next day, the old man went to the commune farm tool factory's sales department and bought a manure basket, a manure scoop, and an iron shovel, and also bought a piglet and a lamb. He also bought a piece of clothing material for his daughter and rubber shoes for his younger son.

\tAfter bringing the farm tools home, the old man spent his days carrying the manure basket, holding the manure scoop, and collecting manure everywhere. In a month, he collected more than six thousand catties of wild manure, exceeding the original target by more than two thousand four hundred catties. According to the quota reward system, in addition to recording six hundred work points for him, he was also awarded ten yuan in cash. The old man beamed with joy, used the bonus to make a new cotton-padded trousers, and his enthusiasm for production was even higher.

New Recruits Outperform Veterans

\tIn Matou Commune, we also saw such an encouraging phenomenon: a large number of laborers transferred to the countryside stood firmly on the front line of agriculture together with the old commune members, working together to improve production. The comrade in charge of the commune party committee told us that after reasonable adjustments throughout the commune, plus the labor force transferred from above, the full and semi-labor force in agriculture has now reached 50% of the agricultural population, most of whom are strong laborers. The frontline of agriculture is strong and well-equipped, and moving stories of new and old commune members working together to improve agricultural production are spreading everywhere.

\tYang Guilin, a worker transferred back from the Xuzhou Port of the East China Shipping Company, happened to encounter the deep plowing of winter fallow land when he arrived at the First Production Team of the Hongqi Brigade. Early the next morning, Guilin woke up his wife, Zhang Xiuying, to go to the field to work together. When they arrived at the field, the couple picked up their shovels and dug the soil and plowed the land with the commune members. Guilin was strong, but it was his first time deeply plowing the land in rows, so he was not proficient. The clods of dirt he dug up kept rolling into the ditch. Old commune member Yang Guifang saw this and ran over to say, "Guilin, come on, I'll teach you." As she spoke, the two of them worked side by side. Guifang taught and demonstrated, while Guilin watched and learned attentively, focusing on Guifang's hand gestures and movements when digging and releasing the soil. Soon, he skillfully mastered the technique of deep plowing in rows. That day, Guilin plowed one acre and two points of land, three points more than Guifang. Guifang said happily, "Guilin is really capable! The first day as an apprentice and he's already surpassed the master. A new recruit is better than a veteran!"

\tThe active labor of the new commune members further encouraged the enthusiasm of the old commune members. New and old commune members encouraged and learned from each other, racing ahead, and fighting enthusiastically on the front line of agricultural production.

You Help Me, I Help You

\tDuring our interview in Matou Commune, we saw that the cadres and commune members here conscientiously handled matters in accordance with the party's policies, and production and life were full of vitality.

\tThe Seventh Team of the Dashan Brigade had a "Chai Pond" that had not been emptied for many years. The team planned to drain the pond before it froze, taking out 20,000 dan of river mud, which would not only be enough Lafei fertilizer for Sanmai (big, small, and Yuanmai wheat), but also prepare basic fertilizer for spring sowing next year.

\tBut after calculating again and again, the labor and tools were not enough. Team leader Fu Yongfa thought to himself: If we miss this favorable opportunity before the freeze, not to mention taking river mud, even breaking the ice will be difficult. What to do? He couldn't make up his mind for a while, so he found Gu Zhengguo, Wang Fenglai and other commune members to discuss. Old commune member Gu Zhengguo suggested: "I heard that the Fourth Team has collected a lot of fertilizer, but they have a relatively large small-scale water conservancy task. It's best to have equal-value exchange cooperation with them, so everyone benefits." The commune members present all agreed with this idea. That day, the team leader led several commune member representatives to the neighboring Fourth Team for consultation. During the consultation, the cadres and commune member representatives of the Fourth Team said: "The season waits for no one, it is most important to grab fertilizer before the freeze. We will help you dry the pond and take the river mud first, and then you will help us with small-scale water conservancy." So, the two sides determined the specific methods of equal-value exchange based on the different circumstances of the mutually cooperative types of work and the intensity of agricultural work, which was fair and reasonable without being fussy. Soon, the Fourth Team sent more than forty strong laborers to help the Seventh Team dry the pond and take the mud, finally completing the task of drying the pond and accumulating fertilizer before the freeze.

\tNow, the members of the Seventh Team are helping the Fourth Team build small-scale farmland water conservancy with even greater enthusiasm, and the cadres and members of both teams are very satisfied. (Attached picture)

    田野里生气勃勃
    特约通讯员　季立夫  本报记者　姜韦才
    前些日子，我们到江苏北部的淮阴市郊区码头人民公社去作了一次访问。踏进公社的土地，处处给人满目清新的感觉。
    田野里，到处生气勃勃，社员们一个个红光满面，精力充沛，有劳有逸地干着冬活。在一块块冬闲地里，人们挥动着铁锹，一个劲地深挖土地。“冬耕深一寸，赛如下遍粪。”河岸上，水荡边，架起了一部部水车，小伙子们飞快地踏动着车轮，干河积肥。许多田头上和深翻过的冬闲地里，已经布满了一堆堆明年春种的基肥。一片片如同绿色地毯般的麦苗，更加招人喜爱。管理麦田的社员们正在忙着追肥、开沟。村庄里，猪羊满圈，鸡鸭成群。捕鱼、编织、打猎等冬季副业生产活动，正在蓬勃兴起。这一切，使人一眼就看出：这里的干部、社员正在为争取明年农业大丰收进行准备工作。
    喇叭筒不管用啦
    一天，玉坝大队办公室门前的广场上，挤满了穿红着绿的姑娘和衣着整齐的老人、小伙子，喜气洋溢地谈生产，拉家常。场子中间摆着一张平整光亮的桌子，三面放满了一个个大大小小的红纸包包，端端正正的写上社员的名字。秋季决算分配大会开始了，队长李进仁满面含笑地按照各小队的次序和社员的名字，把桌上的红纸包包一个一个递给社员。人们接过红纸包包，容光焕发的脸上挂满了喜悦的笑容。经过分配，全大队92％的社员增加了收入，个个分到了现金。
    第三小队得到超产奖励以后，干部、社员更是劲上添劲，当天下午就进一步检查了力争明年更大超产的措施，部署了深翻冬闲地的小段农活。次日早晨，小队长吴延卿看家家户户静悄悄的，没一个人走动。吴延卿心里很奇怪。停了一会，他见四处还没有动静，拿起喇叭筒将要喊叫。突然，从田野里送来了一个清脆的声音：“吴队长，我们在这呢！”吴延卿止不住内心的喜悦，急忙跨着大步赶到田里，一看，社员们已翻好四十多丈地了。
    在这样高涨的劳动热情下，土地似乎也变得松软起来。全小队八十多亩冬闲地的深翻任务，原计划三天完成，结果两天半就全部干完了。
    家家添补小农具
    近些时来，公社农具厂门市部显得格外忙碌，柜台前常常挤满了人群，买粪箕的，买粪勺的，买铁锨的，熙熙攘攘，你选我购。农具厂门市部的同志告诉我们：今年11月至12月10日的四十天中，门市部销售粪箕、粪勺、铁锹、粪桶、粪舀等小农具达六千四百多件，比去年同期增长67.5％。全公社有50％左右的农户购买了小农具，家家户户添补了小农具。
    红旗大队第一生产小队五十多岁的老社员张锦华，在拿到秋季分配的现金以后，当晚，全家人就围在桌子旁边，合计怎么开销。老奶奶说：“替我做件新褂子。”她的话刚一落音，大闺女月英争着要做一件灯心绒夹衣，还要买双球鞋。两个小弟弟嚷嚷闹闹要买胶鞋。老汉笑嘻嘻地说：“你们不能光顾穿戴，还得想着社里的生产啊。”老汉一句话提醒了大家。大闺女说：“我不买球鞋了，替我买把铁锹吧。”老奶奶接着说：“我也不做新褂子啦，买头小猪回来养养吧。”第二天，老汉就到公社农具厂门市部买了一只粪箕、一把粪勺和一把铁锹，还买了一头小猪、一只小羊，顺便替闺女买了一件衣服料子，替小儿子买了胶鞋。
    农具买到家，老汉成天的挑着粪箕，手执粪勺，四处拾粪。一个月来，共拾野粪六千多斤，超过原订指标二千四百多斤。根据定额奖励制度，除给他记了六百个工分外，还奖励十元现金。老汉笑逐颜开，拿着奖励金添做了一条新棉裤，生产热情更高了。
    新兵上阵胜老将
    在码头公社，我们还看到这样一种可喜现象：下放到农村的大批劳动力，和老社员在一起，坚定地站在农业的第一线，齐心协力搞好生产。公社党委负责同志告诉我们：全社经过合理调整，加上上面下放的劳动力，目前农业上的整劳动力和半劳动力，已达到农业人口的50％，其中大部分是强劳动力。农业第一线上兵强马壮，到处传颂着新老社员共同搞好农业生产的动人故事。
    从华东航运公司徐州港下放回来的工人杨桂林，一到红旗大队第一生产小队，正巧碰上深翻冬闲地。第二天一大早，桂林就喊醒了妻子张秀英一道下田干活。到了田头，两口子拿起铁锹，就和社员们一起挖土翻地。桂林的力气大，但条垅深翻土地还是头一回，干起来不内行，挖起的泥块老是往沟子里滚。老社员杨桂芳看见了，连忙跑过来说：“桂林，来，我教你。”说着，两个人行子靠行子，桂芳边教边做，桂林边做边学，专心一意地看着桂芳挖土、放土的手势和动作，不一会就熟练地掌握了条垅深翻的技术，这一天桂林就挖了一亩二分地，比桂芳多挖三分地。桂芳快活地说：“桂林真行啊，第一天当徒弟就赶过师傅，真是新兵上阵，赛过老将啦！”
    新社员积极劳动，又进一步鼓励了老社员的积极性。新老社员互相鼓励，互相学习，你追我赶，热情高涨地战斗在农业生产的第一线。
    你帮我　我帮你
    在码头公社的采访中，我们看到这里的干部和社员处处认真按照党的政策办事，生产、生活充满了生气。
    大山大队第七小队有个多年没有见底的“柴塘”。小队计划在封塘前车干塘水，取出两万担河泥，既可备足三麦（即大、小、元麦）的腊肥，又能为明年春播备好基肥。
    但算来算去，劳力、工具都不够。小队长傅永发心里想：要是错过封冻前这个有利时机，别说取河泥，就是敲冰也困难。怎么办呢？他一时拿不定主意，就找了顾正国、王凤来等几个社员商量。老社员顾正国提议说：“听说四小队肥料已搞了不少，但小型水利任务比较大，最好跟他们来个等价交换的协作，大家都有利。”在坐的社员都赞成这个主意。当天小队长就领了几个社员代表到邻近的四小队进行商量。协商中，四小队的干部和社员代表说：“季节不等人，抢在封冻前搞肥料最要紧。我们先帮你们干塘取河泥，然后你们再帮我们搞小型水利。”于是，双方根据互相协作的工种、农活轻重等不同情况，确定了等价交换的具体办法，既公平合理，又不斤斤计较。不久，第四小队就派了四十多个强劳力帮七小队干塘取泥，终于赶在封冻前完成了干塘积肥的任务。
    现在，七小队社员又以更大的热情帮着四小队兴修小型农田水利，两个小队的干部和社员都很满意。（附图片）
