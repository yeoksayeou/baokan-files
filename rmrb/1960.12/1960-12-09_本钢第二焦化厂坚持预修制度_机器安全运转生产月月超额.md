(Our correspondent in Shenyang, 8th) The Benxi Iron and Steel Company's No. 2 Coking Plant emphasizes equipment maintenance. From 1958 to the present, the equipment utilization rate has remained above 99%. From January to October of this year, fifteen major products, including metallurgical coke, have exceeded the national plan every month.
　　"To do a good job in production, we must first manage the equipment well." This is the profound understanding of the leading cadres of the Benxi Iron and Steel No. 2 Coking Plant over the years. The plant constantly educates its employees on "safety for production, and safety in production" and "everyone loves equipment, and everyone manages equipment." It also stipulates that the deputy director in charge of production directly leads equipment management, and mobilizes the masses to conduct a major equipment inspection every month. Whenever an equipment accident occurs, the full-time equipment management department immediately analyzes the cause of the accident and proposes measures to prevent similar accidents from recurring.
　　Adhering to the equipment preventive maintenance system is an important measure for this plant to continuously improve the equipment utilization rate. The plant leaders organize mechanics and production workers to inspect all mechanical equipment. According to the identified equipment defects and the rules of equipment consumption and accident occurrence, they determine the equipment maintenance cycle item by item, machine by machine, and part by part. Then, according to the planned order, they carry out maintenance and repair item by item, machine by machine, and part by part, and implement the maintenance tasks to each maintenance worker, establishing a maintenance responsibility system.
　　The implementation of this measure has three major benefits: First, it enables mechanics to systematically master and familiarize themselves with the performance, defects, and accident occurrence rules of mechanical equipment, and can eliminate hidden dangers in advance and prevent accidents from occurring suddenly. For example, mechanics observed and measured the coke quenching car in the coking workshop for a long time, and found that its 35 mm thick flange of the travel wheel wore down by 1 mm every month, so it needed to be replaced once a year. The mechanics grasped this rule and replaced the travel wheel when the coke quenching car had been running for eleven months, preventing accidents in advance. Second, since the maintenance of each piece of equipment is planned, maintenance personnel can make full preparations in advance, thereby improving maintenance efficiency and quality. Third, it is conducive to the mechanical repair department preparing the spare parts required for equipment maintenance in advance, ensuring the smooth completion of the maintenance plan. The main accessories of this plant's mechanical equipment total more than 2,000 types. Due to the implementation of the preventive maintenance system, the mechanical repair department prepared the accessories in advance according to the plan, so the main workshops and main equipment have never experienced situations where maintenance and production were affected due to accessories not keeping up.
　　They not only insist on implementing preventive maintenance, but also ensure that most equipment overhauls do not stop production. In the past, the six workshops of this plant had sixteen annual overhaul projects, which were carried out with production stoppages. Now, the number of overhauls with production stoppages has been reduced to seven, and the remaining nine are carried out during production gaps without stopping production in the workshop. This single item alone increases the value of wealth produced for the country by 130,000 yuan each year. The method of maintenance without stopping production is: the maintenance workers pre-assemble the machinery and accessories that need to be repaired and replaced in sets in advance, transport them to the machine equipment, and use the production gap time to carry out maintenance and replacement.
　　Organizing production workers and mechanics to closely cooperate, jointly maintain equipment, repair equipment, and manage equipment, is another important measure for this plant to do a good job in equipment maintenance and management. To this end, the plant's Party committee organized production workers and mechanics to sign "mutual teaching and learning" contracts, with production workers imparting production operation knowledge to mechanics, and mechanics helping production workers learn the skills of repairing equipment. After this activity was launched, 188 veteran production workers in the plant have learned general equipment maintenance skills and undertake simple equipment repair and adjustment work themselves. This enables production workers to further familiarize themselves with the performance of the equipment, operate more carefully, and avoid accidents.

    本钢第二焦化厂坚持预修制度
    机器安全运转生产月月超额
    本报沈阳8日电　本溪钢铁公司第二焦化厂重视设备维修，从1958年到现在，设备利用率一直保持在99％以上。今年1月至10月，冶金焦炭等十五种主要产品，月月超额完成国家计划。
    “要搞好生产，必先管好设备”。这是本钢第二焦化厂领导干部，历年来的深切体会。这个厂不断地向职工进行“安全为生产，生产讲安全”和“人人爱设备，人人管设备”的教育。并确定生产副厂长直接领导设备管理工作，每个月发动群众进行一次设备大检查。每当发生设备事故以后，专职的设备管理部门立即分析发生事故的原因，提出防止类似事故继续发生的措施。
    坚持设备预修制度，是这个厂不断提高设备利用率的一条重要措施。工厂领导上组织机修工人和生产工人对所有的机械设备进行检查，根据查出的设备缺陷以及设备耗损、事故发生的规律，逐项、逐台、逐件地确定设备检修的周期，然后按照计划顺序，逐项、逐台、逐件地进行维护、检修，并且将检修任务落实到每个检修工人，建立检修责任制度。
    推行这一措施有三大好处：第一，使机修工人系统地掌握和熟悉了机械设备的性能、缺陷和设备事故发生的规律，能事先消灭隐患，防止事故突然发生。如机修工人对炼焦车间的消火车进行了长时间的观察、测量，发现它的走行轮三十五毫米厚的轮缘，每个月就磨损一毫米，这样，需要一年更换一次。机修工人掌握了这个规律，在消火车运行十一个月的时候就更换走行轮，预先防止了事故的发生。第二，由于各项设备的检修都有计划，检修人员可以事前进行充分的准备，因此提高了检修效率和质量。第三，有利于机修部门提前预制好设备检修所需要的备件，保证检修计划的顺利完成。这个厂机械设备的主要配件就有二千多种。由于推行预修制度，机修部门事前按计划准备好了配件，因此，主要车间、主要设备从未发生过因配件跟不上而影响检修、影响生产的情况。
    他们不仅坚持实行预修，而且做到大部分设备大修不停产。过去，这个厂的六个车间十六个一年一度的大修理项目，都是停产进行的，而现在停产大修的已减少到七项，其余的九项都是在车间不停产的情况下利用生产间隙进行大修，仅这一项，每年就为国家增产价值十三万元的财富。检修不停产的作法是：检修工人把需要检修和更换的机械和配件，提前成组成套地预装好，运到机器设备旁边，利用生产间隙时间进行检修更换。
    组织生产工人和机修工人密切合作，共同维护设备、检修设备和管理设备，是这个厂做好设备维护管理工作的又一条重要措施。为此，工厂党委组织生产工人与机修工人签订“互教互学”合同，由生产工人向机修工人传授生产操作知识，机修工人帮助生产工人学会检修设备的技能。这一活动开展后，全厂已有一百八十八名老生产工人学会了一般的设备维护检修技能，自己担负简单的检修和调整设备的工作。这样就使生产工人进一步熟悉了设备的性能，更加精心操作，避免事故的发生。
