Inner Mongolia's "Treasure Bowl"

Hulunbuir League is located in the northeastern part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The famous Greater Khingan Range forest area belongs to the jurisdiction of this league. It covers an area of more than 310,000 square kilometers. The land is fertile and rich in products. It is the main agricultural, pastoral, and forestry production base of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. More than 1.8 million people of more than ten ethnic groups, including Mongolian, Han, Daur, Ewenki, and Oroqen, live here.

Hulunbuir is known as Inner Mongolia's "Treasure Bowl." The "green treasure house" - the Greater Khingan Range - runs through the central part of the league. Here, ancient trees reach into the sky. On the mountainsides and in the valleys, there are century-old larch trees and tall birch and fir trees... It is one of our country's important forest industrial bases. In the three years since the Great Leap Forward, the forest workers of all ethnic groups have produced more than 10 million cubic meters of timber for the country, enough to fill hundreds of thousands of train cars.

To the west of the forest sea is the famous Bargu Plateau pasture. In the center of the plateau is Dalai Lake, the largest inland lake in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which is rich in fish. The terrain around the lake is gentle and the water and grass are abundant, making it a good place for herders of all ethnic groups to graze their livestock. In the past three years, the herdsmen in this area have provided the state with hundreds of thousands of draught animals and cattle and sheep for consumption.

The vast river valley plains and the Sanhe River area on the southern foot of the Greater Khingan Range have fertile soil and abundant water resources, making them a developed agricultural zone. With the Greater Khingan Range as the watershed, the rivers east of the range flow into the Nen River, and those west of the range flow into the Ergun River. These more than 170 rivers, large and small, nurture more than 50% of the total area of the league. This area is rich in wheat, rice, sorghum, corn, and soybeans. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, farmers of all ethnic groups in this region have sold 300,000 to 400,000 tons of grain to the state every year. This year, under the guidance of the Party's policy of agriculture as the foundation, the sown area of the league has been expanded by more than one million mu compared with last year, and the average agricultural population has harvested 2,000 jin of grain.

Hulunbuir has the largest number of state-owned farms and ranches in the autonomous region. At present, there are more than 20 state-owned farms and ranches in the league. In addition to managing large-scale agriculture, each farm and ranch also raises more than 400,000 head of livestock, some of which are the strong and powerful Sanhe horses and Sanhe cattle, which can be used for both riding and draught purposes. In recent years, the farms and ranches throughout the league have provided these improved breeds of livestock to 24 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country.

Before liberation, Hulunbuir League had almost no industry. Now, under the leadership of the Party, the people of all ethnic groups have established their own iron and steel, coal, electric power, machinery industries, and modern dairy, leather, and meat joint processing industries. After the people's communes were established, more than 800 small factories appeared in rural areas, forest areas, and nomadic areas. The underground of the plateau and the forest also contains extremely rich mineral resources, waiting for people to develop them.

Hulunbuir has always been known as a "natural zoo." In the dense forests and vast plateau pastures, there are many rare birds and animals such as deer, roe deer, musk deer, jackals, tigers, bears, lynx, wild boars, otters, swans, yellow ducks, arctic foxes, and weasels. Every year, hunters of all ethnic groups hunt a large number of wild animals, providing the state with hundreds of thousands of valuable animal skins and valuable medicinal materials such as musk and deer antler.

    内蒙古的“聚宝盆”
    呼伦贝尔盟在内蒙古自治区东北部，我国著名的大兴安岭林区属这个盟管辖，面积三十一万多平方公里，土地肥沃，出产丰富。它是内蒙古自治区主要的农牧林业生产基地。这里居住着蒙、汉、达斡尔、鄂温克、鄂伦春等十多个民族的一百八十多万人。
    呼伦贝尔被人们称为内蒙古的“聚宝盆”。“绿色的宝库”——大兴安岭，纵贯全盟中部。这里古树参天，在山腰，山谷间，全是一百多年的落叶松和高高的白桦树、杉……，它是我们祖国的重要森林工业基地之一。在大跃进以来的三年里，森林里的各民族职工，为国家生产了一千多万立方米木材，用火车拉也足够装几十万辆车皮。
    林海西侧，是著名的巴尔虎高原牧场。高原中心是内蒙古自治区最大的内陆湖——达赍湖，鱼产丰富，湖的四周地势平缓，水草丰盛，是各族牧民放牧牲畜的好地方。在过去三年中，这个地方的牧民们为国家提供了数十万头耕畜和食用牛羊。
    大兴安岭南麓广阔的河谷平原和三河道地区，土质肥沃，水源丰富，是发达的农业地带。以大兴安岭为分水岭，岭东各河流汇入嫩江，岭西的注入额尔古纳河，这江河两岸的一百七十多条大小河流哺育着全盟总面积的50％以上的土地。这里盛产小麦、稻谷、高粱、玉米和大豆。1958年大跃进以来，这个地区的各民族农民每年向国家出售三、四十万吨粮食。今年，在党的农业是基础的方针指导下，全盟播种面积比去年扩大一百多万亩，平均每个农业人口已经收获二千斤粮食。
    呼伦贝尔是自治区农牧场最多的地方。现在全盟有二十多个国营农牧场，它们除了经营大面积的农业以外，各农牧场还饲养了四十多万头牲畜，其中有一部分是体强力大，乘挽兼用的三河马和三河牛。近年来，全盟各农牧场，已经向全国二十四个省、市、自治区，提供了这类良种牲畜。
    解放前呼伦贝尔盟的工业几乎是个空白点。现在各族人民，在党的领导下，已经建立了自己的钢铁、煤炭、电力、机械工业和现代化的乳品、皮革、肉类联合加工等工业。人民公社化后，在乡村、林区和游牧区，出现了八百多个小型工厂。高原和森林的地下，还蕴藏着极为丰富的矿产资源，在等待着人们去开发。
    呼伦贝尔素有“天然动物园”之称。茂密的森林里和辽阔的高原牧场上，有鹿、麅、麝、豺、虎、熊、猞猁、野猪、水獭、天鹅、黄鸭、北极狐、黄鼠狼等许多珍禽异兽。各族猎民，每年猎取大量野兽，每年为国家提供数十万张珍贵的兽皮和麝香、鹿茸等贵重药材。
