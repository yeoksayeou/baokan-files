    Nigerian Tin Miners' Strike Involves 10,000 Workers
    About 10,000 tin miners in Nigeria recently held a strike in the Plateau tin mining area of the Northern Region, demanding that the tin companies increase wages and improve living conditions.
    The striking workers demanded that every worker working in the Plateau mining area should receive at least three shillings and eleven pence per day.
    It is reported that members of the two miners' unions have set up picket lines to prevent anyone from undermining their strike struggle. On the 16th—the third day of the strike—striking workers clashed with police who entered the mining area.

    尼日利亚一万锡矿工人罢工
    尼日利亚约一万名锡矿工人最近在北部地区的布莱托锡矿区举行罢工，要求锡业公司增加工资和改善生活条件。
    罢工工人要求在布莱托矿区工作的每个工人每天工资至少为三先令十一便士。
    据报道，两个矿工工会的会员布置了警戒线防止有人破坏他们的罢工斗争。在16日——罢工进入第三天的时候，罢工工人曾经同进入矿区的警察发生冲突。
