Implementation Measures of the Treaty Between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia on Dual Nationality

Foreword

The Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia, in the spirit of friendly consultation, based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, implement the treaty on the question of dual nationality, and believe that doing so is in the interests of the people of both countries.

Both sides also agree to take all necessary measures and provide various facilities to enable every person with dual nationality to voluntarily choose their nationality.

To this end, both sides, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia on the Question of Dual Nationality signed on April 22, 1955, and the exchange of letters between the Premiers of the two countries on June 3, 1955, formulate the following implementation measures for the treaty on the question of dual nationality:

Chapter I Scope of Persons Choosing Nationality

Article 1 (1) According to the provisions of the treaty on the question of dual nationality, persons who have the right to declare their choice of the nationality of the People's Republic of China and renounce the nationality of the Republic of Indonesia, or to declare their choice of the nationality of the Republic of Indonesia and renounce the nationality of the People's Republic of China, refer to: persons who, at the time of the entry into force of the treaty, possess the nationality of the People's Republic of China according to the laws of the People's Republic of China and at the same time possess the nationality of the Republic of Indonesia according to the laws of the Republic of Indonesia.

(2) Both sides agree: Based on the principle of respecting the individual's free will, those who were under the age of majority during the period from December 27, 1949, to December 27, 1951, and whose Indonesian nationality was rejected by their parents or on their behalf, are considered to still have dual nationality and therefore enjoy the right to choose nationality.

Article 2 (1) Among those who simultaneously possess the nationality of the People's Republic of China and the nationality of the Republic of Indonesia, there is a category of persons who are considered to have implicitly renounced the nationality of the People's Republic of China and possess only the nationality of the Republic of Indonesia.

(2) The scope of this category of persons referred to in paragraph (1) above shall be determined by the Government of the Republic of Indonesia, and a copy of the list of such persons shall be sent to the Government of the People's Republic of China for its information.

(3) The laws of the Republic of Indonesia, which stipulate who is considered to have implicitly only the nationality of the Republic of Indonesia, should add Chinese Indonesian citizens who have participated in elections to the People's Representative Council of Indonesia or the Local People's Representative Council, as evidenced by documents from the Indonesian Election Commission or other evidence.

Chapter II Authorities Accepting Nationality Choices

Article 3 Persons referred to in Article 1 of these measures, if they wish to retain the nationality of the People's Republic of China, must declare their renunciation of the nationality of the Republic of Indonesia to the following authorities:

(3) In places outside the borders of the Republic of Indonesia and the People's Republic of China: the local or nearby diplomatic or consular missions of the Republic of Indonesia.

Article 5 The temporary offices of the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia shall enjoy proper protection and various facilities for carrying out their tasks on the basis of equality and mutual benefit; personnel of the temporary offices shall enjoy the same exemptions and privileges as corresponding personnel of the Embassy or Consulates, according to their status.

Article 6 The number and location of temporary offices established by the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia shall be specifically negotiated by the Joint Committee, based on the number and distribution of persons simultaneously possessing the nationality of the People's Republic of China and the nationality of the Republic of Indonesia, and the need to facilitate their handling of nationality choice declaration procedures, and shall be established after being agreed upon by the two governments.

Chapter III Nationality Choice Procedures

Article 7 Persons referred to in Article 1 of these measures shall be valid for making declarations of nationality choice within a period of two years after the entry into force of the treaty on the question of dual nationality. The declaration may be made orally or in writing. The declarant may personally go to the authority accepting the declaration to complete the declaration procedures; it may be handled by postal means; or assistance from relevant local social organizations may be accepted in handling the declaration procedures for choosing nationality.

If the authority accepting the declaration deems it necessary, it may request the declarant to provide proof that he has dual nationality. If the proof provided by the declarant is accepted, the date of declaration should be the date on which the declarant initially submitted the declaration form.

(2) The administrative and technical details concerning the declaration of retaining the nationality of the People's Republic of China and renouncing the nationality of the Republic of Indonesia, and the declaration of retaining the nationality of the Republic of Indonesia and renouncing the nationality of the People's Republic of China, may be formulated and promulgated by the two governments respectively within the scope that does not conflict with the relevant provisions of the treaty on the question of dual nationality, the exchange of letters between the Premiers of the two countries, and these measures.

Article 10 (1) If the authority accepting the declaration believes that the declarant is not a person referred to in Article 1 of these measures, it should reply to the declarant in writing stating the reasons and refuse to accept the declaration.

(2) However, the declarant has the right to apply to the Joint Committee for a review of his issue. If the Joint Committee considers it reasonable, it shall submit to the relevant government and recommend that the refusal be re-examined and handled.
