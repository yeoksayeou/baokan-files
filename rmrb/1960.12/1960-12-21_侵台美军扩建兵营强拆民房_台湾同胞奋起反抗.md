Xinhua News Agency, December 20th, Taipei Dispatch: To expand barracks and bases for the American aggressors and the Chiang troops, and for such "reasons" as "slums are an eyesore to American friends," the Chiang Kai-shek clique has recently continued to dispatch large numbers of military police and "illegal construction demolition teams" to forcibly demolish civilian houses everywhere, arousing resistance from Taiwanese compatriots.

According to reports from Taiwanese newspapers, recently, when the U.S. invading troops surveyed a large amount of "military land" in the Qingshui Township area of Taichung County, they actually notified the Chiang Kai-shek clique to send military police to forcibly demolish more than 200 civilian houses, leaving thousands of Taiwanese compatriots homeless. Reports say that after the U.S. aggressor troops expanded the Zuoying military port in southern Taiwan, they expanded the Songshan Airport in Taipei to facilitate the take-off and landing of large U.S. military jet aircraft. Schools and civilian houses near Songshan Airport have suffered the fate of being forcibly demolished. In Shipai, a suburb of Taipei, the American invaders are building the "U.S. Naval Hospital," seizing large amounts of land from Taiwanese compatriots and forcibly demolishing many civilian houses. To suppress the resistance of the local people, the Chiang Kai-shek clique dispatched the "First General Brigade of the Security Police" to be stationed near the construction site, on guard day and night.

Taiwanese newspapers said that when the American aggressors and the Chiang Kai-shek clique seized land and forcibly demolished houses, incidents of bloodshed and suicide tragedies occurred among the Taiwanese people. After the bamboo house of Taichung City resident Chen Yu-dui was demolished, he and his wife committed suicide by taking poison and died in front of the Dacheng Police Station of the Taichung City Police Bureau of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, leaving behind three orphans. In mid-November, 309 households, totaling more than 1,000 residents of Taichung City, collectively petitioned the Chiang Kai-shek clique, protesting the Chiang Kai-shek military police's preparation to demolish the houses they used for shelter. In Taipei City, when the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "illegal construction demolition team" went to Huanhe South Road to prepare to demolish houses, they were repelled by a large group of local residents, including women and children, using bamboo poles and bricks. Zhang Yun, a resident of Tainan City, "seeing a large number of policemen coming to demolish his house, immediately took a knife and jumped onto the roof to resist," and cut five of Chiang Kai-shek's policemen. Yang Fuhong, a resident near Yangmingshan (i.e., Caoshan) Park in Taipei, was indignant that his thatched cottage was forcibly demolished. Not long ago, he rushed into the "Yangmingshan Administration Bureau" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique with a grass rope and strangled the "Acting Director" (equivalent to a puppet county magistrate) of the bureau, Wu Shenmiao, causing him to be "skinned and bleeding, unable to speak." Because the staff of the "Yangmingshan Administration Bureau" discovered it at the time and knocked Yang Fuhong unconscious, this "Acting Director" was not strangled to death. Taiwanese newspapers said that although the Chiang Kai-shek clique arrested a large number of residents who resisted the demolition of their houses and sent them to jail, bloody incidents of resistance continue to occur.

    侵台美军扩建兵营强拆民房
    台湾同胞奋起反抗
    新华社20日讯　台北消息：蒋介石集团为了美国侵略者和蒋军扩建兵营和基地，以及所谓贫民窟“有碍美国友人观瞻”等“理由”，最近继续派遣大批军警和“违章建筑拆除队”到处强拆民房，激起了台湾同胞的反抗。
    综合台湾报纸消息，最近侵台美军在台中县清水镇一带勘察大批“军用土地”时，竟通知蒋介石集团派出军警强行拆除二百多幢民房，使数以千计的台湾同胞流离失所。消息说，美国侵略军在扩建台湾南部左营军港以后，在台北又把松山机场加以扩展，以便美军大型喷气式飞机升降。松山机场附近的学校和民房，都遭到强行拆毁的命运。在台北市郊区石牌锁，美国侵略者正在兴建“美国海军医院”的楼房，霸占了大批台湾同胞的土地，强拆了许多民房。为了镇压当地人民的反抗，蒋介石集团派出了“保警第一总队”驻在工地附近，日夜戒备。
    台湾报纸说，在美国侵略者和蒋介石集团霸占土地强拆民房时，使台湾人民发生流血事件和自杀惨剧。台中市居民陈玉对的竹屋拆毁后，夫妻两人服毒自杀，死在蒋介石集团台中市警察局大城派出所的门前，遗下了三个孤儿。11月中旬，台中市有三百零九户居民共一千多人集体向蒋介石集团请愿，抗议蒋介石军警准备拆除他们借以栖宿的房屋。在台北市，当蒋介石集团的“违章建筑拆除队”到环河南路准备动手拆屋时，被一大群包括妇女、儿童在内的当地居民用竹竿和砖头击退。台南市居民张云在“看到大批警员来拆他的房子时，立即携刀跳上屋顶抗拒”，并且砍伤了五名蒋介石的警察。住在台北阳明山（即草山）公园附近的居民杨福鸿，愤于他的茅屋被强行拆毁，不久前带着一条草绳冲进蒋介石集团“阳明山管理局”内，把这个局的“代局长”（相当于伪县长）吴深淼的脖子勒住，使他“皮破血流，不能言语”。由于“阳明山管理局”的职员当时发觉了，把杨福鸿打晕，这个“代局长”才没有被勒死。台湾报纸说，虽然蒋介石集团把大批抗拒拆屋的居民捕去坐牢，但反抗的流血事件仍然不断发生。
