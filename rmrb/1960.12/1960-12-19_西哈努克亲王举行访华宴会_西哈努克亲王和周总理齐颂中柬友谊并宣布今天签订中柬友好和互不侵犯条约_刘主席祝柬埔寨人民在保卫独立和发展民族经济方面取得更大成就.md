Prince Sihanouk and Premier Zhou Enlai spoke at the banquet, which was filled with a cordial and friendly atmosphere. They both praised the new development of the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian peoples and announced that the Chinese and Cambodian governments would solemnly sign the Sino-Cambodian Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression tomorrow.

Also invited to the banquet were: Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, Saifudin, Bainqen Erdini Qoigyi Gyaincain, Lin Feng, Vice Premiers of the State Council Chen Yi, Ulanhu, Li Xiannian, Lu Dingyi, Luo Ruiqing, Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Burhan Shahidi, Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong, Fu Zuoyi, President of the Supreme People's Court Xie Juezai, and Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng.

Prince Sihanouk spoke. He first expressed his deepest and warmest gratitude to Chairman Liu Shaoqi and other state leaders attending the banquet, and expressed his gratitude to all the guests.

Prince Sihanouk said that we are gratified by the fraternal friendship between Cambodia and China, which enables our two countries to carry out increasingly close cooperation. It embodies the consistency of our two countries' views on various fundamental issues of peace and progress, and fully conforms to the noble principles of Bandung, especially the principles of non-interference and respect for national sovereignty.

Prince Sihanouk emphasized: "During this visit, we have also summarized all the common points between us regarding issues related to our two countries and the positions our two countries have adopted internationally. We have the same belief in the sovereignty of the people, we have the same determination to defend independence and the integrity of national territory, and we are equally committed to the progress and happiness of the people. We also defend the rights of all peoples to freedom, to freely choose their own system, their own path, and the policies they deem appropriate. This belief is fully reflected in the absolute respect for the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries." He concluded: "I should also point out that Cambodia has consistently received the support of great New China in its selfless activities for peaceful coexistence and friendship among all peoples, which has enabled Cambodia to continue to move forward impartially and uncompromisingly on its own path."

In his speech, Premier Zhou Enlai expressed his heartfelt thanks to Prince Sihanouk for his many enthusiastic and friendly words to the Chinese people, and extended his warm congratulations on the success of His Royal Highness's visit.

Premier Zhou Enlai said that Prince Sihanouk pointed out in his speech on the 16th that the friendship between China and Cambodia is based on mutual trust. This is a very correct assessment. He said that it is precisely because the mutual understanding and trust between our two countries continue to strengthen that the friendly relations between our two countries have been able to successfully withstand the test of time and set a good example for the peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems.

Premier Zhou Enlai said: "His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk and the Royal Government of Cambodia have consistently adhered to a policy of peace, neutrality, independence, and autonomy, and have played an increasingly significant and active role in international affairs. The Chinese people and the Chinese government sincerely praise and support the important contributions made by the Cambodian people and the Royal Cambodian Government in maintaining national independence and safeguarding peace in Asia and the world."

When talking about the current international situation, Premier Zhou Enlai severely condemned the foreign aggressor forces for rudely interfering in the internal affairs of Laos.

After the speeches of Prince Sihanouk and Premier Zhou Enlai, the band played the national anthems of China and Cambodia respectively. The audience burst into warm applause for their enthusiastic speeches.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi proposed a toast at the banquet. He said that we are very pleased and very grateful to His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk for holding such a grand and cordial banquet for us. We have just watched with great interest the exhibition introducing the Kingdom of Cambodia, which has given us a further understanding of the economic construction, culture and art of the Kingdom of Cambodia and the peaceful life of the hardworking Cambodian people. We believe that under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk, the Cambodian people will achieve new and greater achievements in defending national independence and developing the national economy.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi proposed a toast to the increasingly close friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian peoples, to the prosperity of the Kingdom of Cambodia and the happiness of the people, to peace in Asia and the world, and to the health of His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk and all Cambodian dignitaries!

During the banquet, the artists of the Cambodian Royal Dance Troupe, who accompanied Prince Sihanouk on his visit, performed wonderful Cambodian and Chinese song and dance programs.

At the entrance of this exhibition, the national flags of China and Cambodia were hung high, and portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Prince Sihanouk, and Premier Zhou Enlai were hung on both sides of the national flags.
