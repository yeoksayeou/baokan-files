Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 5th December: Burmese Prime Minister U Nu submitted a resolution to the House of Representatives, which opened today, requesting Parliament to approve the Sino-Burmese Border Treaty signed between the Burmese government and the government of the People's Republic of China in Beijing on October 1st of this year. On the same day, the Burmese House of Nationalities also held a meeting.

When submitting this resolution, Prime Minister U Nu emphasized, "Considering the history related to the Sino-Burmese border and all relevant circumstances, I sincerely believe that the conclusion of this treaty is in accordance with Burma's best interests. Therefore, I am willing to urge this House to unanimously approve the border treaty concluded by the two governments on October 1, 1960, thereby establishing this peaceful and friendly border between the Union of Burma and the People's Republic of China, and opening a new chapter in Sino-Burmese relations."

Prime Minister U Nu said, "This treaty is the culmination of six years of negotiations between us and the government of the People's Republic of China. It is a historically significant document." He then reiterated his speech, delivered in Beijing before the signing of the treaty on October 1, 1960, praising the treaty, "The treaty that our two governments are about to conclude will, for the first time in the history of our two countries, create a completely demarcated and demarcated border, which is drawn by mutual agreement and is therefore a border of peace and friendship.

"What I just said does not in any way diminish the traditional friendship that fortunately exists between our two countries. But in today's situation, when distances and obstacles are no longer insurmountable, even the best of neighbors, whose relations are firmly established on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, should know exactly where one's territory ends and where the other's territory begins, in order to faithfully implement the principle of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, which is extremely important. Therefore, the work we are about to complete today is a natural and necessary development of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence that our two countries helped formulate in 1954. As such, it is a progress in the worldwide struggle for peace."

Prime Minister U Nu gave high praise to the goodwill and understanding shown by the Chinese government and leaders during the entire negotiation on the Sino-Burmese border issue. He said, "In all fairness, we must admit that such an agreement would not have been possible without the friendly understanding of the Chinese leaders, especially Premier Zhou Enlai, and the Chinese government's desire to reach a settlement." He said, "If we are truly honest, we must admit that China also had its difficulties, and our domestic problems also contributed to the kind of delay that occurred in reaching a settlement. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the goodwill and understanding shown by the Chinese government and the leaders of the Chinese government throughout the negotiations."

In his speech, Prime Minister U Nu also praised the efforts and contributions made by former Burmese Prime Minister and Chief of Staff of the Defense Forces Ne Win in successfully resolving the Sino-Burmese border issue, and expressed his gratitude to him. Prime Minister U Nu also praised all those who had contributed to the work of resolving the Sino-Burmese border issue and expressed his gratitude to them. He specifically mentioned the spirit of overcoming difficulties and the attitude of mutual understanding and accommodation demonstrated by the Sino-Burmese Joint Committee in discussing and resolving the specific issues related to the Sino-Burmese border, in the survey work, and in drafting the Sino-Burmese Border Treaty. He said, "The Joint Committee fully met our expectations and completed this task within the time allotted to them. This is a very commendable achievement for both Burma and China."

He pointed out, "It is precisely because of the close cooperation and collaboration between the two sides and the high sense of responsibility and cooperation shown by the members of each team that this huge task could be carried out so successfully." Prime Minister U Nu said that if Parliament agrees to approve this treaty, the other steps that must be taken are: "First, there is the issue of exchanging instruments of ratification of the border treaty. The exchange of instruments of ratification is scheduled to take place in Rangoon on January 4, 1961, our Independence Day. Premier Zhou Enlai has accepted our invitation to come to Rangoon before then." He said, "I know that this House and the whole country will give them the most sincere and warm welcome, making them feel at home here, just as they made us feel when we went to visit China. To celebrate the exchange of instruments of ratification, the Chinese government has generously proposed to donate 2.4 million meters of printed cloth and 600,000 porcelain plates to the 1.2 million Burmese residents living near the Sino-Burmese border on January 4, 1961. On behalf of the government and this House, I would like to solemnly express our deep thanks and gratitude for this generous and friendly proposal." He said,

 "The second step concerns the constitutional amendments necessary for the exchange of territories stipulated by this treaty. It has been proposed to submit these amendments at the next session of Parliament."

Prime Minister U Nu also spoke about the junction of the Sino-Indian border and the Burmese border, saying that the border dispute between China and India should be resolved by China and India, "I sincerely hope that it will be resolved quickly and peacefully."

    吴努总理在缅甸国会代表院说
    中缅确立了和平友好的边界
    要求国会同意批准符合缅甸最高利益的两国边界条约
    新华社仰光5日电　缅甸联邦总理吴努在今天开幕的国会代表院会议上提出了一项关于要求国会同意批准缅甸联邦政府今年10月1日在北京同中华人民共和国政府签订的中缅边界条约的决议。同一天，缅甸国会民族院也举行会议。
    吴努总理在提出这项决议时强调说，“考虑到同中缅边界有关的历史以及所有有关的情况，我真诚地相信，这项条约的缔结是符合缅甸的最高利益的。因此我愿意促请本院一致同意批准两国政府于1960年10月1日所缔结的边界条约，从而确立缅甸联邦和中华人民共和国之间这个和平和友好的边界，并在中缅关系上揭开新的一章。”
    吴努总理说，“这项条约是我们同中华人民共和国政府之间六年来谈判的结晶。这是一项具有历史意义的文件。”他接着重申他在1960年10月1日条约签字之前在北京发表的赞扬这项条约的讲话说，“我们两国政府就要缔结的条约，将使我们两国之间历史上第一次出现一条完全划定和标定的边界，这条边界是双方协议画出的，因此是一条和平和友谊的边界。
    “我刚才所说的话一点也不意味着贬低我们两国之间幸运地存在着的传统友谊。但是在今天的情况下，当距离和障碍都不再是不能逾越的时候，即使是最好的邻邦，它们的关系已经牢固地建立在和平共处五项原则之上，也应该确切地知道一方的领土到哪里为止，另一方的领土从哪里开始，以便能够忠实地实行互相尊重主权和领土完整的原则，这一点是极端重要的。因此，我们今天即将完成的工作，正是我们两国在1954年帮助制定的和平共处五项原则的一项理所当然的和必要的发展。既然如此，它正是全世界争取和平的斗争的一个进展。”
    吴努总理对中国政府和领导人在整个关于中缅边界问题谈判期间所表示的善意和谅解给予崇高的评价。他说，“出于完全的公平，我们必须承认，要不是由于中国领导人，特别是周恩来总理的友好谅解以及中国政府达成解决的愿望，这样的协议是不会有可能达成的。”他说，“如果我们是真正诚实的话，我们就必须承认中国也不是没有困难的，而且我们的国内问题也有助于造成在达成解决方面所发生的那种延缓。因此我要趁这个机会向中国政府和中国政府的领导人在整个谈判期间所表示的善意和谅解表示敬意。”
    吴努总理在讲话中还赞扬了前缅甸总理、国防军总参谋长奈温在顺利地解决中缅边界问题的工作中所作的努力和贡献，并且向他表示感谢。吴努总理并且赞扬了在解决中缅边界问题的工作中所有出过力量的人们，并且向他们表示感谢。他特别提到中缅边界联合委员会在商谈解决有关中缅边界的各项具体问题上，在勘察工作中以及在起草中缅边界条约等工作中所表现的克服困难的精神和互谅互让的态度。他说，“联合委员会充分实现了我们的期望，在为他们规定的时间内完成了这项任务。对于缅中双方来说，这都是一个非常值得称道的成就。”
    他指出，“正是由于双方的紧密合作和协作以及各队成员所表现出来的对工作的高度负责和协作精神，这项巨大的工作才能进行得这样成功。”吴努总理说，如果国会同意批准这项条约，就必须采取的其它步骤是：“首先是关于交换边界条约的批准书的问题。交换批准书预订1961年1月4日我国独立节的时候在仰光举行。周恩来总理已经接受我们的邀请准备为此前来仰光。”他说，“我知道本院以及全国将给予他们最诚挚和热烈的欢迎，使他们在这里感觉到像在家里一样，正如当我们前去访问中国时他们使我们所感受到的那样。为了庆祝交换批准书，中国政府已经慷慨地提议在1961年1月4日向居住在中缅边界附近的一百二十万缅甸居民赠送二百四十万米花布和六十万个瓷盘。我愿意代表政府和本院郑重地对这个慷慨而友好的提议表示深切的感谢和感激。”他说，
  “第二个步骤是关于为了实行这个条约所规定的交换领土所必须的宪法的修改。已经建议在国会的下届会议上提出这些修改。”
  吴努总理还谈到中印边界和缅甸边界的汇合点，他说，中国和印度之间边界的争执要由中印两国去解决，“我热诚地希望它将迅速地、和平地得到解决。”
