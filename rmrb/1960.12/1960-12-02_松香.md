    Rosin

    Rosin is a light yellow, semi-transparent crystal produced by distilling resin secreted from pine trees. It possesses properties such as moisture resistance, insulation, emulsification, preservation, and adhesion. Rosin has a wide range of industrial applications and is a raw material for various industries, including soap, paper, paint, rubber, and electrical equipment. The addition of rosin to soap increases lather, enhances detergency, and prevents cracking and deterioration. In the papermaking industry, it improves gloss and strength, making paper less permeable and moisture-resistant. It makes paint brighter, faster-drying, and longer-lasting, preventing premature hardening. It can soften raw rubber and increase its elasticity. DDT emulsion, widely used in agriculture, also relies on rosin for emulsification and adhesion. Furthermore, it is needed for the manufacture of matches, light bulbs, batteries, detonators, and other items.

    Turpentine, a major byproduct of rosin production, also has a wide range of uses. In addition to its use in the paint industry, the metallurgical industry uses it as a flotation agent. The chemical industry uses it to manufacture borneol, flake ice, synthetic camphor, reclaimed rubber, and emulsified oil. Furthermore, it can be used in medicine as a topical skin stimulant and antitoxin.

    Guangdong, located in the subtropical zone, is a major rosin producing area in China. Due to the warm climate, long hours of sunshine, and abundant rainfall, pine resin secretion and metabolism are vigorous, and pine resources are abundant. At the same time, Guangdong-produced rosin is of excellent quality, with softening points generally reaching above 70 degrees Celsius and containing very few impurities, which is sold not only throughout the country but also enjoys a high reputation in the international market.

    松香
    松香，是一种浅黄色半透明的晶体；它是由松树分泌出来的树脂经过蒸馏加工制成的。它具有防潮、绝缘、乳化、防腐、粘着等性能。松香在工业上的用途很广，是肥皂、纸张、油漆、橡胶和电工器材等多种工业的原料。肥皂里有了松香，泡沫就多，去污能力增强，还不易干裂变质；造纸工业使用了它，可使纸张增加光洁度和强度，且不易渗水、具有防潮作用。它能使油漆色泽光亮、干燥快、保存时间长，不致过早硬化；它能使生胶软化，增加弹性。农业上应用广泛的DDT乳剂，也是松香在起着乳化、粘合作用。此外，制造火柴、灯泡、电池、雷管等也需要它。
    制造松香的主要副产品松节油，用途也十分广泛，除用于制漆工业外，冶金工业要用它作浮选剂；化学工业要用它制造冰片、结片、合成樟脑、再生胶、乳化油；此外，它还可以作医药上外用的皮肤兴奋剂和抗毒素剂等。
    地处亚热带的广东，是我国松香的主要产区。这里由于气候温暖、日照时间长、雨量充沛，松脂分泌的新陈代谢旺盛，而且松树资源丰富。同时广东出产的松香品质优良，软化点普遍达到七十度以上，含杂质极少，不仅行销全国各地，而且在国际市场上也享有盛誉。
