　　The Imperialist Struggle for the Cigarette Market in Old China
　　A Ying

　　Wen Xiufeng's "Dun Jiao Tang Poetry Collection" sequel contains a poem titled "Moored Foreign Ships": "Foreign steamships moor before setting sail, Tanka boatmen steer clear on both sides. From afar, one hears foreign slaves speaking foreign tongues, and it is said each foreigner shares a tube of smoke." The original note reads: "Foreigners smoke, using paper-rolled tubes, which each person passes around to smoke."

　　This poem was written around Daoguang twenty-six (1846). From the poem and note, paper cigarettes were still very unfamiliar to the Chinese people at that time; what was seen here was just a temporary paper-rolled kind. The main export of British and American imperialism to China at this time was opium.

　　Machine-made paper cigarettes became an instrument of aggression and widely popular in China after the middle of the Guangxu period. The "Shanghai Commercial Scenery Ballads" (1906) by Yian Zhuren, volume four, has a poem praising "Cigarette Companies": "Paper-rolled cigarettes are widely available, young people eagerly buy them to hold in their mouths. Shanghai merchants mostly imitate foreign styles, offering a stick to acquaintances." This illustrates that around 1904, not only were large and small businesses replacing Chinese water pipes with foreign paper cigarettes when entertaining guests, but many young people were also vying to buy and smoke them to show they were "fashionable." With sales booming, the struggle for market share ensued.

　　The United States was the instigator. Originally, the Chinese cigarette market was basically divided between British and American imperialism. American-made "Pin Hai" brand and British-made "Qiangdao" (Bandit) brand, later followed by "Da Ying" (Great Britain) brand, all had great sales. In fact, the two sides were formidable rivals. After the Sino-Japanese War (1894), Japan also entered the fray. This formed a new triangular confrontation.

　　Subsequently, the American and British tobacco companies merged to form the British American Tobacco Company (BAT). With its strong financial backing, it issued cigarettes under the names "Pin Hai," "Qiangdao," "Kong Que" (Peacock), "Ji" (Chicken), "Gu" (Drum), "Dian Che" (Tram), "Di Qiu" (Globe), and so on. In addition to competing with Japanese cigarettes in business methods, BAT also obtained political and economic protection from the Qing government through "public notices" based on the original proposal of the American Tobacco Company in Guangxu twenty-seven (1901). By the winter of 1906, it even published a cigarette monthly, "Bei Qing Yan Bao" (North Qing Tobacco News), which promoted the virtues of American constitutionalism, the president, railways, and, of course, British and American cigarettes.

　　The Japanese government first set a deadline for tobacco merchants to stop manufacturing "imperfect" cigarettes, and then decided that all new cigarettes would be "government-supervised" and entrusted Mitsui Bussan Kaisha to sell them abroad. New cigarette brands included "Yun Long" (Cloud Dragon), "Bian Fu" (Bat), "Feng Huang" (Phoenix), "Star," "Cherry," and "Lily." The cigarette boxes were all in English, even omitting the name of Japan, in order to attract smokers of British and American cigarettes.

　　At this time, the Chinese had also begun to establish the "wholly Chinese-owned" Sanxing Company, issuing cigarettes under the names "Hong Sanxing" (Red Three Stars), "Shuang Ruyi" (Double Wish), and "Yue Guang" (Moonlight." Their advertisements indirectly revealed that British and American cigarettes contained "morphine and various other harmful substances." However, due to their limited strength, the British American Tobacco Company mainly targeted Japan. It was not until Japanese cigarettes were defeated in the Chinese market that Chinese national capitalists established the large-scale Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company. After World War I, the British American Tobacco Company intensified its attacks on Chinese tobacco enterprises.

　　By this time, most of the cigarettes issued by the British American Tobacco Company in China were no longer shipped from their home countries. Instead, they colluded with the Northern Warlords and Kuomintang rulers, stole Chinese land, hired cheap Chinese labor, and carried out planting and manufacturing in factories built in China. This resulted in even higher profits and more thorough exploitation and aggression.

### 帝国主义在旧中国的香烟市场之争

    帝国主义在旧中国的香烟市场之争
    阿英
    文秀峰《敦教堂诗钞》续钞里，有一首题《泊夷船》的诗：“行前泊下火轮船，蛋户摇船避两边。远听鬼奴说鬼话，又传各鬼一筒烟。”原注：“夷人吸烟，用纸卷筒，各人传递吸食。”
    这首诗约作于道光二十六年（1846）。从诗及注看，当时纸烟对中国人还很陌生，这儿见到的，也只是临时用纸卷的一种。英、美帝国主义对中国的主要输出，这时是鸦片烟。
    纸烟用机器卷制，成为侵略物资，并广泛在中国流行，是光绪中叶以后的事。颐安主人《沪江商业市景词》（1906）四卷，有咏《香烟公司》一首云：“纸卷香烟广及时，年轻争买口含之。沪商多学洋人款，知己相逢赠一枝。”就说明到了1904年前后，不但大小商行以外国纸烟代替中国水烟敬客，很多年轻人，也竞相购吸，表示“时髦”。销路既畅，争夺市场的斗争就继之而起了。
    始作俑的是美国。本来，中国纸烟市场，基本上是由美、英两帝国主义分占的。美制的“品海牌”，英制的“强盗牌”，后有“大英牌”，销路都很大。事实上，双方是劲敌。甲午之后（1894），日本又插进足来。这就形成了新的三角形的对抗局面。
    接着美、英两烟公司进行合并，改组成英美烟公司。以雄厚的实力，发行“品海”、“强盗”、“孔雀”、“鸡”、“鼓”、“电车”、“地球”等等名目的纸烟。除在营业方式上和日本烟进行竞卖，还在光绪二十七年（1901）美国烟公司原案基础上，由清政府“出示晓谕”，给与政治利益的和经济利益的保护。到1906年冬，还发行了以宣传美国宪政好、总统好、铁路好、一直到美、英纸烟好为内容的香烟月刊：《北清烟报》。
    日本政府则先限期停止各烟商制造“未能尽善”的纸烟，接着就决定所有新的纸烟一律归“政府监造”，并委托三井物产合名会社在国外发售。新烟名目，有“云龙”、“蝙蝠”、“凤凰”、“斯达”（Star）、“捷利”（Cherry）、“利利”（Lily）等。烟盒上全用英文，甚至不标日本国名，以争取美、英烟的吸者。
    这时，中国人也已开始建立“全系华商股本”的三星公司，发行“红三星”、“双如意”、“月光”等名目纸烟。并在广告里不提名的揭露美、英等国烟里有“吗啡杂色流弊”。不过，由于对抗的力量不大，英美烟公司的矛头，主要还是对着日本。直到日本烟的销路在中国市场被打垮了，中国民族资本家建立起规模宏大的中国南洋兄弟烟草公司，英美烟公司才在第一次世界大战结束后，加紧向中国烟草企业进攻。
    这时，英美烟公司在中国发行的纸烟，绝大部分已经不是从他们本国运来，而是勾结北洋军阀和国民党统治者，盗窃中国土地，雇用贱价的中国劳动力，进行就近种植，并在中国建立工厂就近制造。利润更高，剥削、侵略得也更加彻底了。
