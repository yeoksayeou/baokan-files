    Towering on the Taihang Mountains, beside the heroic Huangyandong (Yellow Smoke Cave), a clear and sweet mountain spring flows along dense green pines and cypresses, through the trenches scarred by war, past the tombs of the martyrs who once defended Huangyandong, reflecting the red-glowing monument. Like a silver dragon dancing in the air, it heads straight down to the beautiful mountain village of Zuohui.

    Legend has it that in the past, Erlang (a mythical figure) carried mountains to chase the sun, and stayed here for a night. He took out a gourd of divine water and drank half of it, leaving the other half on the mountain. At dawn the next day, Erlang roared like thunder towards the thousands of households at the foot of the mountain: "Receive the water!" Who knew that the people in this valley were still sound asleep. The reckless Erlang, seeing that the villagers did not move, became furious and kicked the gourd over, causing the divine water to seep into the Huangyan Mountain. Only a little splashed down the hillside, but it flowed for seven days and seven nights, flowing and flowing, into a winding mountain spring.

    People hurriedly built a Dragon King Temple here. Before they had time to burn incense or make wishes, the spring dried up on the eighth day. Since then, only a touching ballad has remained:

    Holy Man's Spring, oh, Holy Man's Spring,
    Buried at the bottom of the mountain for thousands of years,
    When the Holy Man comes one day,
    The spring water will roll and irrigate the fields.
    ……

    During the Anti-Japanese War, the flames of resistance burned on the Taihang Mountains. General Zuo Quan spent whole years defending Huangyandong, traveling through these thousands of peaks and valleys…

    In the summer of 1941, the sky was clear and the sun was scorching. The anti-Japanese heroes hadn't seen a drop of water for three days, and their mouths were parched. They followed General Zuo Quan closely, looking at this slope, digging at that mountain…

    One day, the sun rose brightly, the sky was full of rosy clouds, and as the silver pickaxe struck, a clear spring suddenly emerged. The divine water, buried at the bottom of the mountain for thousands of years, gushed out at the feet of General Zuo Quan, splashing and flowing continuously. The soldiers were overjoyed, like seedlings after a long drought meeting sweet rain.

    The good news spread like thunder through the mountains and valleys. The story of "Holy Man Zuo" splitting the mountain to bring water spread like spring breeze to every village in Huangyan Mountain. The Eighth Route Army wielded thousands of pickaxes and transformed Huangyandong in the Taihang Mountains into a "Nanniwan." From then on, drought was driven away here, and disasters were expelled; from then on, the weather was favorable and the people lived long and prosperous lives; from then on, the so-called "experts and scholars" of the old society, who stubbornly claimed that there was no spring water in Huangyan Mountain, were refuted by the spring water here. The people here understood the principle of "man will conquer nature" by the mountain spring.

    This spring water is red spring water! Legend has it among the masses: Commander-in-Chief Zhu De let his warhorse drink here, General Liu Bocheng washed his face here, guerrilla fighters used it to cook wild vegetables, and the young people of the Lu Xun Academy of Arts came here to recite revolutionary poems. Countless heroes who killed enemies in fierce battles drank it after their great victories; countless female nurses washed bloody clothes here; countless outstanding Chinese sons and daughters spent their precious youth here.

    People cannot help but cherish the war-torn years when they come to this spring; the loud bugle calls still echo in their minds, and the magnificent scene of the "Huangyandong Defense Battle" is still vivid in their minds, and they cannot help but sing "Forward! Forward! Forward!…."

    Today, the spring water accompanies the torrent of the times, and sings the praises of the Great Leap Forward in chorus with the Yangtze River and the Yellow River. It flows through the high-yielding fields of the People's Commune, falls from the towering terraced fields, nurtures the people of dozens of villages, and irrigates tens of thousands of acres of fertile land. This spring water, opened up by the blood and sweat of the revolutionary predecessors, will flow continuously and forever forward!

    Today, groups of Young Pioneers spread out endless green carpets here, and groups of young men and women who are determined to build the mountainous area discuss the beautiful future here; the girls of the production team always love to sing heartily on the shore, and the old people in the nursing home also love to come to the shade of the trees by the stream to chat; the children in the kindergarten often bathe here, and the commune members often mention Zuoquan County north of Huangyan Mountain.

    Where it flows, motors roar and silver stars glitter; where it flows, golden waves roll and pearls pile up like mountains; where it flows, songs and dances are everywhere, and poems and paintings cover the walls; where it flows, dragons and phoenixes dance, and the sound of books is loud and clear…

    Flow on! Red spring water, you will always be linked with the name of General Zuo Quan, existing together with the glorious tradition of the old Eighth Route Army and the Taihang Mountains, shining with the sun and the moon!

    圣人泉
    李志宽　张凤如
    巍峨的太行山巅，英雄的黄烟洞旁，一道又清又甜的山泉，沿着茂密的苍松翠柏，流经战痕斑斑的壕堑，穿过那昔日保卫黄烟洞烈士的陵墓，倒映着红光闪闪的纪念碑，像一条凌空飞舞的银龙，直奔下秀丽的山村——左会。
    相传，当年二郎担山赶太阳，路经此地住了一宿。他拿出一葫芦神水饮了一半，剩下一半放在山上。第二天拂晓，二郎朝着山下的千家万户，发出雷霆般的巨喊：“接水！”谁知当时这一沟人还沉浸在梦乡里。那鲁莽的二郎见村民没有动静，便烈性大发，猛的一脚将葫芦踢倒，使神水渗进黄烟山里。只溅下山坡一点就整整流了七天七夜，流呵，流呵，流成一股迂回曲折的山泉。
    人们连忙在这里盖起一座龙王庙，还没来得及焚香、许愿，第八天头上泉水就干涸了。从此，只留下一段动人的歌谣：
    圣人泉呵，圣人泉，
    埋没山底几千年，
    有朝一日圣人来，
    泉水滚滚浇田园。
    ……。
    抗战时期，抗日烽火燃烧在太行山上。左权将军为保卫黄烟洞整年整月地奔波在这千峰万涧……。
    1941年夏天，晴空万里，烈日当头。抗日健儿们三天没见一滴水，嘴里像火燎一样。他们紧跟在左权将军身边，瞅瞅这坡，挖挖那山……。
    一天，旭日东升，霞光满天，银镐落处，豁地冒出一股清泉，埋没山底几千年的神水，在左权将军的脚下涌出，浪花飞溅，奔流不息。战士们乐得像发了狂，像久旱的禾苗碰上了甘雨。
    喜讯像春雷一样传遍山里山外，“左圣人”劈山引水的故事，像春风一样吹遍了黄烟山每一个村落。八路军队伍挥起千镐万钁，将太行山里的黄烟洞变成了“南泥湾”。从此，这里驱走了旱魔，赶跑了灾难；从此，这里风调雨顺，人寿年丰；从此，这里用泉水驳斥了旧社会的所谓“专家、学者”硬说黄烟山里概无泉水的谰言，这里的人们，在山泉边领会了“人定胜天”的道理。
    这泉水是红色的泉水！群众中传说：朱总司令在这里饮过战马，刘伯承将军在这里洗过脸，游击队员们用它煮过野菜，鲁迅艺术学校的青年们来这里吟过革命的诗篇。多少个杀敌英雄在酣战大捷之后饮过它；多少个女护士在这里洗过血衣；多少优秀的中华儿女把宝贵的青春度在这里。
    人们一来到这泉水边，便情不自禁地怀念起那战火纷飞的岁月；那嘹亮的军号声依然回旋在脑海里，那“黄烟洞保卫战”的壮烈图景仍然历历在目，不由地就会唱起“向前！向前！向前！……。”
    今天，泉水伴随着时代的激流，和长江大河合唱着大跃进的赞歌。流过人民公社的丰产方，飞下高耸入云的层层梯田，哺育着数十个村庄的人民，灌溉着上万亩良田沃野。这用革命前辈们血汗开出的泉水，将川流不息，永远向前！
    今天，一群群红领巾在这里铺下无边的绿色地毯，一伙伙发愤图强建设山区的青年男女，在这里畅谈着美好的将来；生产队的姑娘们总爱在岸上纵情高歌，敬老院里的老人们也总爱来溪边的树荫下谈天；幼儿园的孩子们常常在这里洗澡，社员们常常叨念那黄烟山北面的左权县。
    它流过之处，马达轰鸣，银星闪闪；它流过之处，金浪滚滚，珍珠堆山；它流过之处，歌舞遍地，诗画满墙；它流过之处，龙飞凤舞，书声琅琅……。
    奔流吧！红色的泉水，你将和左权将军的名字永远连在一起，像老八路的光荣传统一样和太行山共存，与日月齐辉！
