Xinhua News Agency, Accra, December 18th: The Cameroon People's Union, the Cameroon Democratic Women's League, and the Cameroon Democratic Youth League jointly held a congress in Accra from December 13th to 16th. In an atmosphere full of combat and unity, the representatives studied the domestic and international situation in Cameroon, adopted a joint declaration and a program of struggle for 1961, and reaffirmed their determination to strengthen the struggle for the complete independence of Cameroon and the liberation of Africa.

The joint declaration pointed out that U.S. imperialism is now virtually the number one enemy of freedom, democracy, and friendship among the people of all countries, and U.S. imperialists are particularly responsible for the prolongation of the Cameroon war.

The joint declaration said that in recent years, the crisis of imperialism has deepened greatly, while socialist countries have continued to advance in all aspects at an astonishing pace. The people of all countries have expressed an unprecedentedly strong will to strive for immediate liberation and work together to build a world of peace and progress. This massive wave is forcing the imperialists to retreat.

The joint declaration said that U.S. imperialism continues to do everything possible to obstruct the liberation of the Cameroonian people. It supports French colonialists and their puppets in the Cameroon war by all means, in terms of diplomacy, finance, weapons, and ammunition. The Franco-American imperialists viciously poisoned Félix Moumié, the chairman of the Cameroon People's Union, blatantly displaying their aggressive nature.

When discussing the situation of the struggle in Cameroon, the joint declaration especially pointed out the development of the struggle in southwestern Cameroon, especially in the Bamileke region. The declaration said that in Cameroon, the guerrilla areas have expanded to several provinces. In the enemy-occupied areas, there are tens of thousands of unemployed people in the cities, the cost of living continues to rise, and the people are increasingly dissatisfied. The strengthening of armed struggle has finally helped to improve the ideological and political level of the people.

In order to realize the reunification and true independence of Cameroon, the joint declaration put forth the following program of struggle: (1) Immediate withdrawal of French and British troops and military technicians, abolishment of various agreements that subjugate Cameroon to foreign governments, and immediate Africanization of all Cameroonian leaders; (2) Restoration and respect for all political and trade union freedoms, and release of political prisoners in the eastern and western Cameroon regions; (3) Organization of a unified Cameroonian provisional government including representatives of all truly representative political parties in these two regions; (4) Development of the economy and promotion of social welfare. The joint declaration called on Cameroonian patriots to immediately organize a broad united front of anti-imperialist struggle on the basis of the above program.

The joint declaration called on the independent governments of Asian and African countries and all anti-imperialist forces in the world to support the struggle of the Cameroonian people.

    喀麦隆人民联盟等组织联合举行代表大会
    决心为喀麦隆完全独立而斗争
    通过宣言谴责美帝国主义是各国人民的头号敌人
    据新华社阿克拉18日电　喀麦隆人民联盟、喀麦隆民主妇女联盟和喀麦隆民主青年联盟12月13日到16日联合在阿克拉举行代表大会。代表们在充满战斗和团结的气氛中研究了喀麦隆国内和国际形势，通过了一项联合宣言和1961年的斗争纲领，重申了要加强为争取喀麦隆的完全独立和非洲的解放而斗争的决心。
    联合宣言指出，美帝国主义现在实际上是自由、民主和各国人民之间友谊的头号敌人，美帝国主义者特别应对喀麦隆战争的延长负责。
    联合宣言说，近年以来，帝国主义危机大大加深，社会主义各国则继续在一切方面以惊人的步伐向前迈进。各国人民空前有力地表示出争取立即获得解放并协力建设一个和平和进步的世界的意志，这股声势浩大的浪潮在迫使帝国主义者后退。
    联合宣言说，美帝国主义继续千方百计阻挠喀麦隆人民的解放，它不择手段地在外交、财政、武器和弹药等方面，支持法国殖民主义者及其傀儡进行喀麦隆战争。法美帝国主义者恶毒地毒害喀麦隆人民联盟主席费利克斯·穆米埃，他们明目张胆地显示出了他们的侵略本性。
    联合宣言在论述喀麦隆的斗争形势时，特别指出，在喀麦隆西南部、特别是在巴米累克地区斗争的发展。宣言说，在喀麦隆，游击区已经扩大而扩及好几个省。在敌占区，城市里失业人口数以万计，生活费用不断上涨，人民日益不满。武装斗争的加强终于有助于提高人民的思想和政治水平。
    为了实现喀麦隆的重新统一和真正独立，联合宣言提出下列斗争纲领：（一）立即撤退法、英军队和军事技术人员，废除使喀麦隆屈从外国政府的各项协定，立即实现所有喀麦隆领导人员非洲化；（二）恢复和尊重一切政治和工会自由，释放在东、西两个喀麦隆地区的政治犯；（三）组织一个包括在这两个地区真正有代表性的所有政党代表在内的重新统一的喀麦隆临时政府；（四）发展经济和促进社会福利。联合宣言号召喀麦隆爱国者在上述纲领的基础上立即组织一个广泛的反帝斗争统一阵线。
    联合宣言呼吁亚非国家独立的政府以及世界一切反对帝国主义的力量声援喀麦隆人民的斗争。
