Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 25th. The full text of Vice Premier Chen Yi's speech at the farewell banquet for Prince Sihanouk is as follows:

Your Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Head of State of Cambodia, Respected Cambodian Guests, Friends and Comrades:

Your Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk, you will be returning home tomorrow. During these unforgettable days, I am very honored to have the opportunity to accompany Your Royal Highness on another visit to various parts of our country.

I would especially like to mention that tonight, Your Royal Highness, in the name of the Head of State, awarded me the highest honor of the Kingdom of Cambodia. I would like to express my sincere gratitude once again. Your Royal Highness, I have served my country and my people for forty years. My country has awarded me three medals and the military rank of Marshal of the People's Republic of China. This is a great honor bestowed upon me by the motherland, and I am very grateful. Today, Your Royal Highness, in the capacity of Head of State, has awarded me the highest medal of the Kingdom of Cambodia. This is the first time I have accepted an honor from a foreign head of state. I will never forget it, and I am willing to continue to work tirelessly for the friendship between our two peoples.

Your Royal Highness visited four socialist countries, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and China, this time. From the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains to the shores of the South China Sea, from west to east, from north to south, Your Royal Highness met millions of people who love peace and love labor, sowing the seeds of friendship everywhere, bringing the friendship of the Cambodian people to the socialist countries, and also bringing the friendship of the socialist countries to the Cambodian people. You are returning with friendship and victory. Please allow me to express my warm congratulations on Your Royal Highness's successful visit.

Your Royal Highness, this is your third friendly visit to China. Each of Your Royal Highness's visits has made important contributions to enhancing the friendship between China and Cambodia. Through this visit, our two countries signed a Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression, writing a glorious page in the history of Sino-Cambodian friendship. The contributions made by Your Royal Highness in establishing and developing the friendship between China and Cambodia have won the respect of the Chinese people.

Your Royal Highness said that China "has not adopted a chauvinistic attitude towards Cambodia," which is a completely factual and extremely fair evaluation. China has always been oppressed by imperialist countries and only stood up after a long and arduous struggle. According to the Chinese saying "Do not do unto others what you would not want done unto you," we are determined not to bully others now, and we will never bully others in the future. We sincerely hope that all countries in the world can live in harmony. Here, I would like to point out that the Chinese people greatly admire the Kingdom of Cambodia's style of upholding independence and not fearing brute force. Under the leadership of Your Royal Highness, the Kingdom of Cambodia dares to withstand the threats and attacks of certain countries; dares to adhere to a foreign policy of peace and neutrality; and dares to rely on its own strength to work hard to build its own country. This requires great political courage. The Chinese people greatly admire your and your country's courage. Therefore, the Chinese people have always fully supported your struggle against aggression and for the maintenance of national independence; therefore, a deep friendship has been established between China and Cambodia; therefore, the relationship between China and Cambodia can become an outstanding example of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. We firmly believe that if all countries in the world can get along as friendly as our two countries, world peace can be guaranteed.

His Excellency Deputy Chairman Penn Nouth, His Excellency Prime Minister Pho Proeung, and His Excellency Ung Hong Sath, who accompanied Your Royal Highness on this visit, are all visiting our country for the first time. You are loyal assistants to Your Royal Highness and important ministers of the Kingdom of Cambodia. Your love for your country, your efforts for Sino-Cambodian friendship, and your attitude of humbly learning during your visit to China have all left a deep impression on the Chinese people. It is a pity that your visit was too short. I hope you will come again for a longer visit next time.

There is an old saying in our country, "A thousand cups of wine are not enough when meeting a bosom friend," which means that friends who are close to each other can never finish talking. On the eve of this farewell, we are all filled with reluctance to say goodbye to Your Royal Highness and all the distinguished Cambodian guests. Our words are short, but our feelings are long and we have much more to say. Your Royal Highness, you came from the south and brought warmth to our northern country. When you return victoriously, you will bring the cool climate of the northern country to your southern country. I wish that we both can adjust the coolness and warmth to be more suitable, so that the flower of friendship between the two peoples can bloom more luxuriantly and brilliantly.

Now, I propose a toast:

To the health of Your Royal Highness and Madame, to the health of His Excellency Penn Nouth, His Excellency Pho Proeung, His Excellency Ung Hong Sath, and all the distinguished Cambodian guests,

To the health of Ambassador Leng Ngeth,

To the everlasting friendship between the people of China and Cambodia,

To the prosperity of the Kingdom of Cambodia,

To the health of Her Majesty Queen Kossamak Nearireath,

To world peace,

Cheers!

    在欢送西哈努克亲王宴会上
    陈毅副总理的讲话
    新华社广州25日电　陈毅副总理在欢送西哈努克亲王宴会上的讲话，全文如下：尊敬的柬埔寨国家元首诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王殿下，尊敬的全体柬埔寨贵宾们，朋友们和同志们：
    西哈努克亲王殿下，您明天就要回国了。在这些难忘的日子里，我能够有机会再一次陪同亲王殿下访问我国各地，感到十分荣幸。
    我要特别提到的是，今天晚上亲王殿下以国家元首的名义，授给我柬埔寨王国最高荣誉勋章，我再一次表示衷心的感谢。亲王殿下，我为我的国家和我国的人民服务已达四十年，我的国家授给我三个勋章和中华人民共和国元帅的军衔，这是祖国给我的莫大荣誉，我非常感激。今天亲王殿下以国家元首的身份，授予我柬埔寨王国最高勋章，这是我第一次接受外国元首给我的荣誉，我将永志不忘，我愿意为两国人民的友谊继续不断努力。
    亲王殿下这次出国访问捷克斯洛伐克、苏联、蒙古和中国四个社会主义国家。从喀尔巴阡山之麓直到南海之滨，自西而东，由北到南，亲王殿下会见了千百万热爱和平、热爱劳动的人民，到处撒下了友谊的种子，给社会主义国家带来了柬埔寨人民的友谊，也把社会主义国家的友谊带给了柬埔寨人民。满载友谊，胜利而归。请允许我对亲王殿下成功的访问，表示热烈的祝贺。
    亲王殿下，您是第三次来中国作友好访问。殿下的每一次访问，对增进中柬两国的友谊，都作出重要的贡献。通过这次访问，我们两国签订了友好和互不侵犯条约，在中柬友谊史上写下了光辉的一页。亲王殿下在建立和发展中柬两国友谊方面所作出的贡献，赢得了中国人民对您的尊敬。
    亲王殿下讲过中国“对柬埔寨没有采取沙文主义的态度”，是一种完全符合事实的、极为公正的评价。中国历来受帝国主义国家的压迫，只是经过了长期艰苦的斗争之后，才站了起来。按照中国古语“己所不欲勿施于人”的原则，我们立志现在不欺侮别人，将来也永远不会欺侮别人。我们真诚地希望世界上所有国家都能和睦相处。在这里，我要指出：中国人民非常钦佩柬埔寨王国坚持独立，不畏强暴的风格。柬埔寨王国在亲王殿下的领导下，敢于顶住某些国家的威胁和攻击；敢于坚持和平中立的外交政策；敢于依靠自己的力量，埋头苦干建设自己的国家。这需要极大的政治勇气。中国人民非常钦佩您和您的国家的这种勇气，因而中国人民一贯全力支持你们反对侵略，维护民族独立的斗争；因而中柬两国建立了深厚的友谊；因而中柬两国的关系能成为不同社会制度国家和平共处的杰出范例。我们深信，如果世界上所有国家都能够像我们两国一样友好相处，世界和平就能够得到保证。
    这次随同亲王殿下前来访问的宾努副主席阁下、福·波伦首相阁下、?·刁龙副首相阁下，都是初次来到我国。你们是亲王殿下的忠实助手，是柬埔寨王国的重臣。你们热爱自己的祖国，你们努力于中柬友谊，以及在访问中国期间谦虚学习的态度，都给中国人民留下了深刻的印象。可惜你们访问的时间太短了，希望你们下次再来作较长时间的访问。
    我国有句古语说，“酒逢知己千杯少”，就是说知己的朋友在一起，话是说不完的。在这离别的前夕，我们大家怀着依依惜别的心情，为亲王殿下和全体柬埔寨贵宾们话别，真是语短情长，不尽欲言。亲王殿下，你来自南方，给我们北方国家带来了温暖，当您胜利归去的时候，又将北方国家的凉爽气候，带到你们南方国家去，我祝愿我们双方把凉爽与温暖调节得更适宜，使两国人民的友谊之花，开得更加茂盛，更加灿烂。
    现在，我提议：
    为亲王殿下和夫人，为宾努阁下、福·波伦阁下、?·刁龙阁下和全体柬埔寨贵宾们的健康，
    为兰·?特大使阁下的健康，
    为中柬两国人民永远友好，
    为柬埔寨王国繁荣昌盛，
    为哥沙曼·尼亚里丽王后陛下的健康，
    为世界和平，
    干杯！
