Xinhua News Agency, December 7th dispatch from New York via TASS: The United Nations Secretariat released on the 6th two telegrams from Guinean President Sékou Touré to the UN Secretary-General, protesting the activities of the UN forces' headquarters in the Congo.

In one telegram, Touré stated that the government and people of the Republic of Guinea express deep indignation at the Congolese Mobutu armed bandits' insults to Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba. Touré also conveyed to Hammarskjöld that Guinea is disturbed by the UN representative's open support for illegal and violent actions in the Congo.

Touré said that, in view of this situation, the Republic of Guinea reserves the right to take other means within Africa in the future to support the Congolese people's struggle against all forms of colonialism.

In another telegram, Touré, on behalf of the government of the Republic of Guinea, protested the atrocities of the Mobutu group in expelling the diplomatic envoys of the United Arab Republic and Ghana from Congolese territory, and the UN representative's indifference to these actions. Touré demanded that the United Nations reinstate these two diplomatic missions and prevent the recurrence of such illegal incidents.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, December 6th: The Permanent Bureau of the Iraqi Peace Fighters Committee stated today in a memorandum submitted to the US Ambassador to Baghdad that "the US government must bear the historical responsibility for the consequences of the UN forces' activities (in the Congo), including the action of arresting Lumumba."

The memorandum said that the kidnapping of Lumumba "is part of a series of conspiracies to strangle Congolese independence and the freedom of the Congolese people."

The memorandum said, "This action has once again prompted the people of Africa, Asia, and Latin America to be more vigilant against the imperialists' tricks and has aroused the people of all countries to fight against imperialism."

The memorandum said that thousands upon thousands of Iraqi peace fighters condemn the series of misdeeds committed by the imperialist bloc in the Congo under the guise of "UN forces," and demand the immediate release of Lumumba, the legitimate Prime Minister of the Congolese government, as a preliminary measure to stop the aggression and interference in the Congo.

    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国秘书处6日发表了几内亚总统塞古·杜尔给联合国秘书长的两封电报，电报抗议联合国驻刚果部队司令部的活动。
    杜尔在一份电报中说，几内亚共和国政府和人民对刚果蒙博托武装匪徒侮辱刚果总理卢蒙巴表示深切的愤慨。杜尔并且向哈马舍尔德表示，几内亚对联合国驻刚果代表公然支持非法和强暴行动的立场感到不安。

    杜尔在另一份电报中代表几内亚共和国政府对蒙博托集团把阿拉伯联合共和国和加纳驻刚果的外交使节逐出刚果领土的暴行和联合国驻刚果代表对这种行动漠不关心的态度表示抗议。杜尔要求联合国恢复这两个外交代表机构并且防止这种非法事件重演。
    据新华社巴格达6日电　伊拉克和平战士委员会常设局今天在送交美国驻巴格达大使的一份备忘录中说，“美国政府应对联合国军
  （在刚果）的活动，包括逮捕卢蒙巴的行动的后果承担历史上的责任。”
    备忘录说，对卢蒙巴的绑架“是扼杀刚果独立和刚果人民自由的一系列阴谋活动的一部分。”

    备忘录说，成千上万的伊拉克和平战士谴责帝国主义集团在“联合国军”的遮掩下在刚果所干的一系列勾当，并要求立即释放刚果政府合法总理卢蒙巴作为制止对刚果进行侵略和干涉的初步措施。
