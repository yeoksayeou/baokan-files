Rational Use of Labor to Ensure Increased Agricultural Production
Chen Renhe, Wei Zhenyu

The Lijiajing Management Area (basic accounting unit, the same below) of Quanwuying Commune in Shuoxian County, Shanxi Province, has continuously increased production and rapidly changed its impoverished state because it has maintained an absolute advantage in the number of laborers in agricultural production and is able to use them rationally.

The Lijiajing Management Area is a joint village management area composed of seven small hillside villages, with 290 households, 1,081 people, and 13,715 mu of loess ridges and thin stony soil. In the past, due to poor management, unclear priorities in production, and unreasonable use of labor, crop yields were very low, and the masses lived in poverty. After liberation, with the development of the agricultural cooperative movement, the relations of production continued to change, labor organization was constantly reorganized, and some experience was explored and accumulated in the use of labor, gradually embarking on a more rational and scientific track, which powerfully strengthened the main agricultural production front. The production value created by each laborer increased year by year, quickly transforming from a low-yield grain area into a high-yield area, and the lives of the commune members gradually changed from poverty to prosperity.

In the past three years, the average grain production per laborer in this management area was: 2,524 jin in 1958; 2,568 jin in 1959; and 3,070 jin in 1960. The total grain output in 1960 was 1.35 million jin, an increase of 71% compared with 1957 before communization. Averaged over the entire area's population, this is more than 1,250 jin per person. Grain sold to the state has also increased year by year in the past three years.

The most important experience of this management area in using labor is that it has maintained sufficient labor in agricultural production, and also maintained a certain number of strong laborers. The entire management area currently has 441 full and semi-laborers, accounting for 40.7% of the total population, of which 362 are full laborers, accounting for 82% of the total full and semi-laborers. The weaving factory, pig farm, and transportation operated by the management area occupy a total of 21 laborers, less than 5% of the total labor force in the area. This means that more than 95% of the labor force is truly invested in the front line of agricultural production. This management area has the following main experiences in the rational use of labor.

Guarantee Key Points by Adapting to Circumstances and Times

The agricultural production front includes agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery; agricultural production itself includes grain, vegetables, cotton, oil, hemp, etc.; in addition, there are other works serving agriculture in the rural areas. Under such a wide front and many projects, what should be the main focus, how should labor be arranged, and what proportion should each occupy? This is a very important question. In the use of labor, the Lijiajing Management Area has always adhered to the three main principles: that all undertakings should focus on production; that all production should focus on agriculture; and that agricultural production should focus on grain. Based on this principle, labor is arranged rationally according to circumstances and times, first ensuring that more than 80% of the labor force is used for agricultural production, powerfully guaranteeing the front line; according to the characteristics of the area's vast grassland resources, 9% of the labor force is used to strengthen the second line of animal husbandry; other forestry, sideline production, short-distance transportation, and livelihood welfare undertakings occupy a total of 11% of the labor force. Under this principle, during the busy farming season, troops should also be drawn from other departments to ensure agricultural production.

In order to prepare for each farming task in each season and stage in advance, when planning production for the coming year in winter each year, a comprehensive plan and annual plan is made for the use of labor based on the number of mu of land planted, the types of crops, the busy and slack seasons, and the amount of labor required, and then more detailed arrangements are made by stage according to the busy, medium busy, and less busy seasons. Generally, during the medium busy seasons of April, May, August, and September, the labor force used in agricultural production should account for 80%; during the busy farming seasons of June, July, and October, troops should also be drawn from all fronts to concentrate all efforts on field production. For example, in 1960, during the drought resistance and moisture preservation sowing, the surprise weeding, and the autumn harvest campaign, the management area stopped the weaving factory and released thirteen laborers to participate in the production of the production teams; the rubber-wheeled carts used for transportation were also temporarily assigned to the production teams to serve agriculture, and three of the six breeders in the pig farm were also put into field production; the feeders and canteen cooks of each production team also took half a day to rush to weed and harvest. As a result, the labor force used in agricultural production reached about 90%. During the slack season from November to the end of March of the following year, the labor force used in agricultural production is generally no less than 50%, mainly for accumulating fertilizer, transporting fertilizer, repairing land, and repairing agricultural tools in preparation for spring plowing.

The use of labor in other undertakings is generally also centered on serving agricultural production. For example, the large-scale weaving factory in the slack farming season, in addition to using most of the cash income for agricultural production investment, also wove more than 400 pieces of agricultural tools such as manure baskets, back baskets, and manure winnowing fans for each production team in the winter of 1959. In short, in the arrangement and use of labor, this management area has always grasped the spirit of maintaining key points according to circumstances and times, so that agricultural production has sufficient labor under any circumstances.

Employ Troops Skillfully by Adapting to People

After arranging labor according to affairs and times, it is also necessary to assign work according to the physical strength and expertise of each laborer, making the best use of their talents. The method is: first, to vigorously grasp the comprehensive utilization of labor, and advocate specializing in one profession while also engaging in multiple professions, and using one person for multiple purposes. The eight managers of the canteen also serve as cooks; in addition to raising pigs and chickens, the six warehouse keepers and twenty-four cooks also planted 70 mu of vegetables; in the past, forty feeders were solely responsible for feeding livestock, but now they also engage in chopping grass for bedding, accumulating fertilizer, and grazing livestock. In addition, they also squeezed out time to participate in weeding and harvesting. In 1960, they weeded 240 mu of various seedlings such as millet, beans, and yams, and harvested 115 mu of crops, greatly saving labor. Secondly, all laborers are ranked according to their technical level, physical strength, and other conditions, and assigned to different lines to give full play to each person's strengths, greatly improving labor efficiency. For example, Zhu Yi, a sheep herding expert, used to be assigned to do farm work and could only top half a laborer. After implementing the system of experts returning to their teams, he alone only used one and a half laborers as assistants and herded 500 sheep, with one person topping two. The sheep he herded were better than those herded by others: all ewes of breeding age were fully mated and pregnant, and the survival rate of lambs reached over 95%. Yue Tong, 67, and Yue Fan, 68, are experts in growing melons. In the past, when they were assigned to do other farm work, they could only play an auxiliary role. However, after they were fixed to grow melons, they showed their skills. In 1960, the 13 mu of pumpkins they planted yielded 39,000 jin, and the 7 mu of watermelons yielded 17,640 jin, worth more than 2,000 yuan, with each person creating a value of more than 1,000 yuan. In addition, the management area also assigned all 62 auxiliary laborers to do what they could. Thirdly, each production team divides into working groups according to people, so that the strong are matched with the strong, the weak with the weak, soldiers with soldiers, and generals with generals, thus overcoming the phenomenon of strong laborers waiting for weak laborers and weak laborers lacking confidence to compete for advancement, which wasted labor.

Arrange Meticulously by Adapting to Work

After arranging labor according to physical strength, technology, expertise, and other conditions, it is also necessary to make specific arrangements by season, by stage, and by looking at the sky, the land, the time, and the people, and adapting to the work; what kinds of work are there in each season, which work should be done first or later, which work should be assigned to which people, and preparations should be made early for each job, and labor should be used rationally. The specific method is: first, make short arrangements according to long-term plans, and combine the arrangement of farm work with the arrangement of labor. At the end of each month, the farm work to be done in the next month is classified in detail: light work, heavy work, whole work, odd work, long-distance work, short-distance work, difficult work, easy work, work to be done first, and work to be done later, and then labor is used rationally according to the work. This management area has always adhered to the principle that if auxiliary laborers can do the work, full and semi-laborers should not be used; if semi-laborers can do the work, full laborers should not be used; if weak laborers can do the work, strong laborers should not be used; and if female laborers can do the work, male laborers should not be used. For example, for field weeding, thinning seedlings, picking beans, and picking yams, auxiliary laborers can top one and a half laborers, so all auxiliary laborers are used to do it; for pulling peas, broad beans, soybeans, cutting sesame, and some work in the threshing ground, women and semi-laborers can also top a male full laborer, so it is assigned to women and semi-laborers. Using labor according to the work is of great benefit to improving the quality of farm work, improving production efficiency, and taking care of the health of commune members. For example, in the summer weeding, young and middle-aged people are sent to weed the distant land, the land with large weeds, and the land that is difficult to weed; semi-laborers are called to weed the land closer, the thin fields, the small weeds, the loose soil, and the easy-to-weed land; the land next to the village is contracted to managers, warehouse keepers, cooks, feeders, and others; and auxiliary laborers are used more for weeding and grazing livestock. In this way, not only is the quality of farm work improved and more work is done, but auxiliary laborers, semi-laborers, and weak laborers do not feel tired. Second, work is rushed during the slack season for use during the busy season, and work is rushed during the less busy season for use during the busy season. For example, when commune members cannot go to the fields to work on rainy days, they organize surprise repairs of warehouses, build yam cellars, remove manure, and compost fertilizer, saving more than 1,100 labor days, freeing up more labor for field production on sunny days and during the busy farming season. Third, time is not wasted, and roads are not traveled empty. During the weeding stage, when farm work is particularly busy and labor is very tight, the method of having people who go to the fields to weed bring back ten jin of grass for the livestock each time they return saves more than 1,200 labor days. During the autumn harvest, organizing laborers who go to the fields to carry crops back saves more than 4,000 labor days. Fourth, in non-production undertakings, the strong are drawn to supplement the weak, the full are drawn to supplement the semi, and men are drawn to supplement women. This has enhanced the strength of the agricultural production front. For example, all 40 feeders in the area used to be male laborers, and 13 of them were strong laborers. After the start of spring plowing in 1960, the 13 strong male laborers were drawn from the feeders and replaced with 13 female semi-laborers.

Rational Layout by Adapting to the Land

After discussion by all commune members and with everyone's unanimous agreement, 1,700 mu of interplanted land between small teams was adjusted, as well as 21 large and small canals 15 li long and 6 large and small roads 10 li long, turning distant land into nearby land and distant roads into nearby roads, thereby greatly reducing the time spent walking back and forth and increasing labor time. In addition, 12 field manure pits and 2 sheep farms were built in remote fields for local accumulation, local composting, and local use. In addition, refined fertilizer is sent to the distant fields, which greatly reduces the labor used to transport fertilizer. Furthermore, planting is adjusted according to land quality and the principle of crop rotation, and crops such as yams and corn, which require a lot of fertilizer, a lot of labor, and a large autumn harvest task, are planted as far as possible in nearby land and relatively nearby land, and crops such as peas, broad beans, and sesame, which save fertilizer, save labor, and have a small autumn harvest task, are planted in distant land, which can save even more labor.

In short, as long as we are careful and meticulous in agricultural production, use labor skillfully, and achieve a rational layout, we can give full play to the role of each laborer, greatly save labor, and improve labor productivity.

Mobilizing the Enthusiasm of Commune Members

The rational, skillful, and scientific use of labor is an extremely important aspect of improving labor productivity. However, whether the enthusiasm of the labor force can be fully发挥出来 (give full play to) depends on the guiding role of people's thoughts. Therefore, while using labor skillfully, we must strengthen ideological and political work and care about the material interests of commune members. The Party branch and management committee of the Lijiajing Management Area often organize cadres and commune members to conscientiously study the Party's various policies, guidelines, and instructions in rural areas, and strengthen political education, so that the ideological consciousness of cadres and commune members is continuously improved. At the same time, special attention is paid to the lives of commune members, implementing a combination of work and rest to ensure that commune members have sufficient rest and sleep time. Except for emergency tasks such as rushing to harvest and flood control and disaster relief, and extinguishing pests and diseases, labor time is generally not increased. Commune member meetings are avoided as much as possible on summer evenings, and commune members are given appropriate rest days according to the busy and slack farming seasons. During the busy farming season, male laborers have two days off per month, and female laborers have four days off. During the winter slack season, semi-laborers and weak laborers work half a day and rest half a day, and even strong laborers work no more than about five hours a day. Secondly, the distribution work is done in a timely manner. In recent years, this management area has ensured that the net income of more than 90% of the commune members has increased year by year. Furthermore, the distribution policy of distribution according to work and more work more pay is resolutely implemented, temporary advances are abolished, and a system of pre-issuing wages by season and bi-monthly is implemented. All seven production teams in the area have also resolutely implemented the "three guarantees and one reward" system and other systems such as labor management of work evaluation and point recording, quota management, and small contract work, and production responsibility system. This ensures that commune members who have high attendance and high work efficiency receive due labor remuneration. This has enabled most commune members to exceed the quota month after month and season after season. In 1960, 70% of the labor force exceeded the quota. Male full laborers averaged more than 300 labor days, female full laborers and male semi-laborers averaged more than 200 labor days, and female semi-laborers averaged about 100 labor days.

Due to the rational use of labor, the Lijiajing Management Area has greatly发挥了 (given full play to) the role of each laborer and achieved good results. On the basis of the great leap forward in agriculture in 1958, although natural disasters were encountered in 1959 and 1960, agricultural production still achieved a bumper harvest, and it has been a provincial-level advanced agricultural unit in Shanxi for two consecutive years.

    合理使用劳力保证农业增产
    陈人和　魏振宇
    山西朔县全武营公社李家阱管理区（基本核算单位，下同），由于在农业生产上保持了绝对优势数量的劳动力，又能够合理使用，因而连年增产，迅速地改变了穷困面貌。
    李家阱管理区是由七个山坡小村组成的联村管理区，全区二百九十户，一千零八十一人，耕种着一万三千七百一十五亩黄土圪梁和石厚土薄的土地。过去由于经营不善，生产主次不明，使用劳力不尽合理，农作物产量很低，群众生活困难。解放后随着农业合作化运动的发展，生产关系不断改变，劳动组织不断进行整顿，在劳动力的使用上，也摸索、积累了一些经验，逐步走上了更加合理、更加科学的轨道，有力地加强了农业生产主攻战线。每个劳动力创造的生产价值一年比一年增多，很快由粮食低产区变成了高产区，社员生活也逐步由穷困变成富裕。
    近三年来，这个管理区每个劳动力平均生产的粮食是：1958年二千五百二十四斤；1959年二千五百六十八斤；1960年三千零七百斤。1960年的粮食总产量是一百三十五万斤，比公社化前的1957年增长了71％。按全区人口平均，每人是一千二百五十多斤。三年来卖给国家的粮食也逐年有所增加。
    这个管理区使用劳动力最主要的经验是，在农业生产上保持了足够的劳动力，而且保持了一定数量的精壮劳动力。全管理区现有男女整半劳动力是四百四十一个，占到人口总数的40.7％，其中全劳力三百六十二个，占全半劳力总数的82％。管理区经营的编织厂、猪场和搞运输共占用劳力二十一个，不足全区劳力总数的5％。这样就有95％以上的劳动力真正投入了农业第一线的生产。这个管理区在合理使用劳力上，有以下主要经验。
    因事因时制宜保证重点
    农业生产战线，包括农林牧副渔五业；农业生产本身又有粮菜棉油麻等等；此外，农村还有为农业服务的其它工作。在这种战线宽广、项目很多的情况下，究竟以什么为主，劳动力如何安排，各占多大比例？这是一个很重要的问题。李家阱管理区在使用劳力上，始终坚持了各项事业以生产为主；各项生产以农业为主；农业生产又以粮食为主的三主方针。本着这个方针因事因时合理安排劳力，首先把80％以上的劳动力用于农业生产，有力地保证了第一线；根据本区草源广阔的特点，用9％的劳力加强了牧业第二线；其它林、副业生产、短途运输和生活福利等各项事业，共占用劳动力11％。在此原则下，在农活大忙时，还要从其它部门抽兵调将保证农业生产。
    为了每季每段的农活都提前有所准备，每年在冬季计划下年生产的时候，就根据种植的土地亩数、作物种类、季节忙闲、用工多少，把使用劳动力的情况作出全面规划和全年计划，再按大忙、中忙、小忙季节分段作出更细致的安排。一般中忙季节的4、5、8、9月份，农业生产上使用的劳动力要占80％；农活大忙时的6、7、10月份，还要从各条战线上抽兵调将，集中一切力量搞好田间生产。如1960年抗旱抢墒下种、突击锄苗、秋收运动中，管理区把编织厂停下来，腾出十三个劳力参加了小队生产；搞运输的胶皮车也暂时下放到生产小队为农业服务，猪场的六个饲养员也抽出三人投入田间生产；各生产小队的饲养员、食堂炊事员也都抽出半天的时间抢锄、抢收。从而使农业生产上用的劳动力达到了90％左右。在农闲时期的十一月到下年的三月底，用在农业生产上的劳动力一般也不少于50％以上，主要是用作积肥、送肥、土地整修、农具修理等春耕准备。
    在其它事业上的用工，一般也都围绕为农业生产服务。如农闲季节大办编织厂，除了现金收入的大部分用于农业生产投资外，1959年冬季，还给各生产小队编粪筐、篓驮、粪簸箩等农具四百余件。总之，在劳力的安排和使用上，这个管理区始终是掌握了因事因时保住重点的精神，使农业生产在任何情况下都有足够的劳动力。
    因人制宜　巧用兵力
    把劳力因事因时安排好以后，还要按每个劳动力的体力和专长因人制宜，因才使用。办法是：首先大抓劳动力的综合利用，提倡一专多兼、一人多用。食堂的八个管理员都兼炊事员；六个保管员、二十四个炊事员除了养猪喂鸡外，还种了蔬菜七十亩；过去四十个饲养员专管喂牲口，现在也兼做铡草垫圈、积肥、放牲口等活。此外，他们还挤出时间参加锄田、收秋，1960年他们共锄谷子、豆类、山药等各种禾苗二百四十亩，收割庄稼一百一十五亩，这样就大大节省了劳动力。其次，对所有的劳动力，都根据技术高低、体力强弱等条件分别排队，分线安排，充分发挥每个人的特长，大大提高了劳动效率。如放羊能手朱意，过去分配他干农活，只能顶半个劳力，实行能手归队后，他一个人只用了一个半劳力作助手，就放了五百只羊，一人顶二人。他放的羊比别人放的好：适龄母羊全配全怀，羊羔成活率达到95％以上。六十七岁的岳同和六十八岁的岳繁两个老汉是种瓜能手，过去分配他们干别的农活，只能起个辅助劳力的作用。可是，固定他们种瓜以后就大显了身手。1960年他们种的十三亩南瓜收了三万九千斤，七亩西瓜收了一万七千六百四十斤，价值二千多元，每人创造价值在千元以上。此外，管理区还把六十二个辅助劳力都分配他们力所能及的活干。再次是，各生产小队都因人分编作业小组，做到强配强，弱配弱，兵对兵，将对将，这样就克服了强劳力等弱劳力，弱劳力没信心争先的窝工浪费现象。
    因活制宜　细致安排
    把劳力根据体力、技术、专长等条件进行因人安排后，还要分季、分段和看天、看地、看时、看人、因活具体安排；哪个季节有哪些活，哪些活该先干或后干，哪些活配哪些人去干，件件活都要早作准备，用人合理。具体办法是：首先根据长计划进行短安排，把农活排队和劳力排队结合起来。每月月底把下月所要做的农活，分轻活、重活、整活、零活、远活、近活、难做的活、好做的活、先做的活、后做的活详细排队，然后因活合理使用劳力。这个管理区始终坚持了辅助劳力做得了的活就不用整半劳力去做；半劳力做得了的活就不用整劳力去做；弱劳力做得了的活就不用强劳力去做；女劳力做得了的活就不用男劳力去做的原则。比如田间拔草、间苗、摘豆角、拾山药等活，辅助劳力去干足顶一个半劳力，就全用辅助劳力去做；拔豌豆、扁豆、大豆、割胡麻和一些场子里的活，妇女、半劳力去干，也足能顶住个男全劳力，所以就分配给妇女、半劳力去做。因活用人对提高农活质量，提高生产效率和照顾社员的身体健康都有很大的好处。比如夏锄当中，远地、草大的、难锄的，就派青壮年去锄；近一些的地、薄田、草小、土松、易锄的就叫半劳力去锄；村旁的地就包给管理员、保管员、炊事员、饲养员等人去锄；拔草、放牲口就多用辅助劳力去做。这样，既提高了农活质量，多做活，辅助劳力、半劳力和弱劳力又都不感到劳累。第二、农闲时赶工农忙时用，小忙时赶工大忙时用。如下雨天社员们不能下田劳动时，就组织突击修仓库、打山药窖、出圈、沤肥等，节省下一千一百多个劳动日，给晴天和农活大忙时腾出更多的劳力进行田间生产。第三、时不空过，路不空行。在农活特别繁忙的锄苗阶段，劳力甚感紧张，就采取了下地锄田的人，回来时每人给牲口往回捎拔十斤草的办法，节省了劳动日一千二百多个。秋收时，组织下地的劳力回来时捎背庄稼，节省了劳动日四千多个。第四、在非生产事业上还进行了抽强补弱，抽整补半，抽男补女。增强了农业生产战线上的力量，比如全区四十个饲养员过去都是男劳力，而且其中有十三个精壮劳力。1960年春耕开始后，就把十三个男壮劳力从饲养员中抽出来，补上了十三个妇女半劳力。
    因地制宜　合理布局
    经过全体社员讨论，在大家一致同意的基础上，调整了小队与小队之间的插花土地一千七百亩，还调整了十五里长的大小渠道二十一条，十里长的大小道路六条，使远地变成近地，远路变成近路，从而大大减少了往返走路的时间，增加了劳动时间。并且还在远田建立了田头粪坑十二个和野外建羊场二个，就地积肥，就地沤制，就地使用。再加上远田送精肥，这样就大大减少了运肥的用工。再就是根据土地质量和调过茬口的原则进行调剂种植，把山药、玉米等送肥多、用工多、秋收任务大的作物，尽量种在近地和比较近的地里，把豌豆、扁豆和胡麻等省肥、省工、秋收任务小的作物种在远地里，这样就可以节省更多劳力。
    总之，在农业生产上只要精打细算，巧用劳力，并做到合理布局，就能充分发挥每个劳力的作用，大大节省劳力，提高劳动生产率。
    调动社员的积极性
    合理地、巧妙地、科学地使用劳力，是提高劳动生产率的一个极关重要的方面。但是，劳动力的积极性能不能全部发挥出来，人们的思想又起着主导作用。所以，在巧用劳力的同时，必须加强思想政治工作和关心社员的物质利益。李家阱管理区的党支部和管委会经常组织干部和广大社员认真学习党在农村的各项政策和方针、指示，并且加强政治教育，使干部和社员的思想觉悟不断提高。同时特别关心社员的生活，实行劳逸结合，保证社员有足够的休息和睡眠时间。除了突击抢收和防洪抢险、扑灭病虫害等紧急任务外，一般都不增加劳动时间。夏天晚上尽量不开社员大会，并根据农事忙闲给社员适当的休息假日。农忙时每月男劳力休假两天，女劳力休假四天。冬闲季节，半劳力和弱劳力半日劳动，半日休息，强壮劳力一天劳动也不过五小时左右。其次是及时做好分配工作，近几年来，这个管理区保证了90％以上的社员纯收入一年比一年有所增加。并且坚决贯彻了按劳分配，多劳多得的分配政策，废除了临时借支，实行了按季按双月预发工资制度。全区七个生产小队还坚决贯彻执行了“三包一奖”和评工记分、定额管理、小包工的劳动管理及生产责任制等制度。使出勤多、工效高的社员得到应有的劳动报酬。这样就使大部分社员月月季季超定额。1960年，70％的劳力超过了定额。男全劳力做的劳动日平均在三百个以上，女全劳力和男半劳力做的劳动日平均在二百个以上，女半劳力做的劳动日平均一百个左右。
    李家阱管理区，由于合理使用劳动力，大大发挥了每个劳动力的作用，获得了良好的效果。在1958年农业大跃进的基础上，1959年和1960年虽然接连遭到自然灾害，农业生产还是获得丰收，连续两年成为山西省农业先进单位。
