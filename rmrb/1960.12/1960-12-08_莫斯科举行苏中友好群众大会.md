Chairman Brezhnev says that the Soviet and Chinese people bear a special responsibility in the struggle for the future of all mankind. Chairman Liu Shaoqi says that the great Soviet Union has always been China's good teacher and friend, and China will always stand with the Soviet Union.
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 7th. Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman of the CPC Central Committee, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, and head of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation, attended the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Mass Rally held by over 12,000 representatives from all walks of life in Moscow at the Central Lenin Stadium Sports Palace at 2:30 PM (Moscow time) today to welcome the Chinese Party and Government Delegation.
    Hanging on the rostrum of the presidium were the national flags of China and the Soviet Union, and a large banner with the inscription "Long Live the Eternal and Unbreakable Friendship Between the Great Peoples of the Soviet Union and China!" in Chinese and Russian was hung above the presidium.
    The members of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation present at today's mass rally were Li Jingquan, Lu Dingyi, Yang Shangkun, Liu Ningyi, and Liu Xiao.
    The Soviet side present at the meeting included Soviet Party and government leaders Aristov, Brezhnev, Ignatov, Kozlov, Kosygin, Mikoyan, Mukhitdinov, Suslov, Furtseva, Shvernik, Pospelov, members of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union Voroshilov, Deputy Chairmen of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Ustinov and Zasyadko, Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union Marshal Malinovsky, Minister of Foreign Affairs Gromyko, and heads of various departments of the Soviet government.
    Also present at the mass rally were diplomatic envoys of various countries to the Soviet Union and Chinese students studying in Moscow.
    At 2:30 PM, Chairman Liu Shaoqi and others, accompanied by Soviet Party and government leaders such as Brezhnev, ascended the rostrum. At this moment, the entire audience stood up, and the venue erupted with stormy and prolonged applause and cheers.
    Demichev, First Secretary of the Moscow City Committee of the CPSU, first spoke at the rally. He warmly welcomed Chairman Liu Shaoqi and members of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation on behalf of the working people of Moscow. He said that the Soviet people sincerely congratulate the Chinese people on the achievements they have made under the leadership of the Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong. He said that the steel-like friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people is something that no force in the world can shake, and this friendship was established in the common struggle of the two peoples.
    After Demichev announced the opening of the rally, the band played the national anthems of China and the Soviet Union.
    Sustretov, a worker from the Moscow Likhachev Automobile Factory, warmly welcomed the distinguished Chinese guests on behalf of the workers of Moscow. He said that the friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people is as solid as a rock, and what unites us is the invincible Marxism-Leninism. We are very pleased that the great Chinese people are advancing together with the Soviet Union and the socialist camp.
    Academician Yanshin of the Soviet Academy of Sciences spoke on behalf of the capital's intellectuals, saying that the Soviet people are proud of the achievements made by the Chinese people in building socialism. The Soviet people are the most loyal and reliable friends of the Chinese people.
    Pavlova, a student from Moscow University, spoke on behalf of the youth of Moscow, saying that the Soviet people regard every achievement of the Chinese people as their own achievement and the achievement of the entire socialist camp. She said that in the world, rivers can be dried up and mountains can be leveled, but the great friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people is eternal and unbreakable. She finally shouted in Chinese:
    "Long live the great fraternal friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!"
    Next, Brezhnev, member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, spoke.
    Brezhnev said that the visit of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation to the Soviet Union once again vividly demonstrates the further strengthening and development of Soviet-Chinese friendship.
    He pointed out that in these days, the attention of hundreds of millions of people around the world is focused on the documents of the meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties of various countries. He said that the meeting documents embody the collective wisdom of the various Marxist-Leninist parties.
    Brezhnev emphasized that at this meeting, the communist and workers' parties of various countries planned the path for further unity of the socialist camp, and pointed out new possibilities and tasks for the anti-imperialist struggle, the struggle for social progress, the struggle for the complete elimination of the colonial system, and the establishment of eternal friendship among the peoples of all countries.
    Brezhnev said: "The increasingly strengthened unity and friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people is the most important guarantee for further strengthening the socialist system." He also pointed out that the socialist system has a strong influence on the entire process of modern world development.
    Brezhnev emphasized that the Chinese people have such a loyal and reliable friend as the Soviet Union. He quoted Khrushchev as saying: "The Soviet Union will regard any aggression against the People's China by the imperialists as an aggression against its own country."
    Speaking of the great significance of Soviet-Chinese friendship, Brezhnev said: "The Soviet Union and China, linked by unbreakable bonds of friendship, are an indestructible fortress of peace and the security of all peoples." He said that no force can destroy this friendship.
    Brezhnev expressed his firm belief that the day is not far off when the "Chiang Kai-shek corpse" will stop defiling the atmosphere of the United Nations and the real China will occupy its due seat in this organization. He also noted with satisfaction that the Chinese government supports the Soviet Union's proposals aimed at consolidating peace and opposes war instigators together with the Soviet Union.
    Speaking of the unity of socialist countries, Brezhnev said that what bourgeois activists find incomprehensible is that a large number of countries voluntarily and entirely in accordance with their own interests pursue the same line in international affairs without coercion or pressure. These activists often judge the relations between socialist countries according to the old examples of the capitalist jungle.
    Brezhnev emphasized that the entire socialist family is looking to the future, while the imperialist alliance is indulging in the past.
    Brezhnev said that in the struggle for the future of all mankind, the Soviet and Chinese people bear a special responsibility. "It is on our two countries, on our two parties, that the working people of the world place their hopes."
    He said that the Soviet and Chinese people are doing everything possible not to betray this trust.
    After Brezhnev spoke, he warmly embraced Chairman Liu Shaoqi.
    Chairman Liu Shaoqi then spoke at the rally. When Chairman Liu Shaoqi walked to the podium, the venue erupted with stormy applause, and the participants shouted slogans such as "Long live Soviet-Chinese friendship!"
    In his speech, Chairman Liu Shaoqi first expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet people for the fraternal and sincere friendship shown to the Chinese people during the visit of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation to the Soviet Union.
    Chairman Liu Shaoqi then spoke about the great achievements of the Soviet Union's communist construction that he had seen during this visit, and recalled his personal experiences during his first visit to the Soviet Union in 1921.
    Chairman Liu Shaoqi said that from the very first day, the Chinese Communists regarded the Chinese revolution as a continuation of the October Revolution. In the hearts of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, the great Soviet Union has always been a good teacher and friend. He said that for forty-three years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the great Soviet people have made arduous efforts to build and defend socialist Soviet Union, and have achieved great victories in socialist construction and great victories in the Patriotic War. In a short period of time, a poor and backward Russia was built into an advanced socialist power. All these miraculous achievements have strengthened the forces of peace and socialism, and have inspired the confidence of the people of all countries in striving for a better future. Now, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union headed by Comrade Khrushchev, the Soviet people are victoriously implementing the magnificent Seven-Year Plan and carrying out comprehensive communist construction, attracting the broad masses of working people in all countries of the world with new achievements. The Chinese people sincerely congratulate the Soviet people on all the achievements they have made in communist construction. Your achievements are our achievements, and we are filled with a sense of pride for this.
    Chairman Liu Shaoqi said that the great Soviet Union is a strong fortress of world peace. The Soviet Union fulfills its fraternal obligations of mutual assistance and cooperation to socialist brother countries, actively supports the struggle of oppressed nations and oppressed people in the capitalist world for liberation, and has always strived to achieve peaceful coexistence among countries of different social systems. Chinese people firmly support these policies pursued by the Soviet Union in international affairs. Not long ago, Comrade Khrushchev led the Soviet delegation, together with the delegations of other socialist countries, made new and beneficial efforts at the Fifteenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly to expose the aggression and war policies of the imperialist bloc headed by the United States and to expose the ugly colonialist system. The Soviet Union's proposals for complete and thorough disarmament and prohibition of nuclear weapons, etc., which were put forward in order to ease international tensions, have been warmly responded to and supported by all peace-loving countries and people in the world. The Chinese people would like to thank Comrade Khrushchev because at the Fifteenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, he firmly advocated the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations and sternly refuted the shameless slanders and smears made by the United States against China.
    After talking about the achievements of China's socialist construction, Chairman Liu Shaoqi said that in socialist construction, the Chinese people, just as in the past in the revolution, have received great assistance from the Soviet Union. The Chinese people will never forget the Soviet Union's assistance. I would like to once again express the gratitude of the Chinese people to the Soviet people.
    Chairman Liu Shaoqi said that in international affairs, China has always unswervingly joined the Soviet Union and other socialist brother countries in doing its utmost to contribute to the cause of opposing imperialism, safeguarding world peace, and striving for human progress. In the relations between socialist brother countries, China will insist on fulfilling its internationalist obligations and practice mutual assistance and cooperation with the Soviet Union and all socialist brother countries. China resolutely gives active sympathy and support to national democratic revolutionary movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the revolutionary struggles of the people of all capitalist countries. Like all other socialist countries, China has always pursued a peaceful foreign policy, advocating peaceful coexistence among countries of different social systems on the basis of the Five Principles, and working to ease international tensions. China will forever stand with the entire socialist camp, with all peace-loving countries and people, and fight to the end for the victory of the cause of world peace.
    Chairman Liu Shaoqi then spoke about the recent meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties of various countries in Moscow. He said that the meeting unanimously adopted the Statement and the Appeal to the Peoples of the World, which is another event of great historical significance following the 1957 Moscow meeting and its Declaration. The Statement of this meeting, which was issued yesterday, reaffirmed the 1957 Moscow Declaration, summarized the development of the international situation in the past three years, clarified many important issues facing the international communist movement, and put forward the future combat tasks of the communist and workers' parties of various countries. There is no doubt that the outcome will further strengthen the unity of the socialist camp and the entire international communist movement, further inspire all revolutionary and progressive people and all forces cherishing freedom and peace in the world, and push the cause of the people of the world for peace, democracy, national liberation, and socialism to new and greater victories.
    Chairman Liu Shaoqi said that now, the struggle of the people of all countries for world peace, national liberation, democratic freedom, and socialism has developed to a new upsurge. The forces of peace have surpassed the forces of war, the progressive forces have surpassed the reactionary forces, and the socialist forces have surpassed the imperialist forces. Before us lies a bright future for the cause of peace, democracy, national liberation, and socialism. The people, who are building socialism and communism and account for one-third of the world's population, and the people of various countries in the capitalist world involved the working-class revolutionary movement, the national-democratic movement and the general democratic movement, have merged into a general torrent that impacts the imperialist world system. On the one hand, we see that the nature of imperialism has not changed, the danger of a new world war has not passed, and the people of the world must maintain a particularly high degree of vigilance. At the same time, we also see that, due to changes in the international class balance of forces, it is possible in our era to prevent imperialism from launching a world war by relying on the united struggle of the powerful forces that safeguard the cause of peace today. Although the imperialists headed by the United States are still stubbornly and frantically carrying out activities of arms expansion, war preparations and aggression, as long as the people of the world further act, form an international united front against the imperialist policies of aggression and war, and wage a persistent struggle against the imperialist group headed by the United States, they will surely be able to stop imperialism from launching a world war and safeguard world peace.
    Chairman Liu Shaoqi said that in the struggle of the people of all countries for world peace, national liberation, democratic freedoms, and socialism, the unity of the socialist camp and the unity of the international communist movement are the most crucial guarantees for victory. Unity is life, unity is strength, unity is victory. The more united we are, the happier the people of the world will be, the more inspired they will be, and the more they will be able to increase their confidence in their own strength.
    Chairman Liu emphasized that the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union are the two largest parties in the international communist movement, and China and the Soviet Union are the two largest countries in the socialist camp. The two parties and the two countries also bear particularly important responsibilities for our common cause, and the unity of the two parties and the two countries is of particular significance. Our common enemy—the imperialists headed by the United States—are always trying in every possible way to undermine the unity between China and the Soviet Union. However, just as they cannot see the sun rising from the west, they will never see the separation between the two great parties, the great countries, and the great peoples of China and the Soviet Union. Our unity is linked by common ideals and common causes, developed and consolidated in the common struggle against common enemies, and based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. This great unity has withstood the test of storms, and no force in the world can destroy it. The whole world can see that in the common struggle against imperialism and for the realization of communism, whether in wind or rain, the Chinese people will always stand with the Soviet people. I firmly believe that the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Chinese people and the Soviet people, will always protect the unity of our two parties and two peoples as if protecting their own eyes. Under the great banner of Marxism-Leninism, let us unite more closely and march forward side by side for the victory of our common cause!
    Chairman Liu Shaoqi's speech was repeatedly interrupted by stormy applause.
    After Chairman Liu Shaoqi spoke, he warmly embraced Comrade Brezhnev and Comrade Demichev, and the venue erupted with prolonged applause and cheers. Chairman Liu Shaoqi and members of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation joined hands with Soviet Party and government leaders, fully demonstrating the great and unbreakable friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union.
    The conference proceeded from beginning to end in an atmosphere of friendship, unity, and high enthusiasm.
    After the meeting, the Sino-Soviet co-produced film "The Wind from the East" was shown. (Attached pictures)

    在马克思列宁主义旗帜下紧密团结并肩前进
    莫斯科举行苏中友好群众大会
    苏共莫斯科市委第一书记杰米契夫和各界代表讲话热烈欢迎中国党政代表团  勃列日涅夫主席说，在争取全人类未来的斗争中，苏中人民肩负着特殊的责任  刘少奇主席说，伟大的苏联一直是中国的良师益友，中国永远同苏联站在一起
    新华社莫斯科7日电　中共中央副主席、中华人民共和国主席、中国党政代表团团长刘少奇，今天下午二时三十分（莫斯科时间）在中央列宁运动场体育宫出席了莫斯科各界代表一万二千多人为欢迎中国党政代表团而举行的苏中友好群众大会。
    大会主席台讲坛上悬挂着中苏两国国旗，用中、俄文书写的“苏中两国伟大人民永恒的、牢不可破的友谊万岁！”的大幅标语横挂在主席台上方。
    出席今天群众大会的有，中国党政代表团团员李井泉、陆定一、杨尚昆、刘宁一、刘晓。
    苏联方面出席大会的有，苏联党政领导人阿里斯托夫、勃列日涅夫、伊格纳托夫、科兹洛夫、柯西金、米高扬、穆希金诺夫、苏斯洛夫、福尔采娃、什维尔尼克、波斯别洛夫，苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员伏罗希洛夫、苏联部长会议副主席乌斯季诺夫和扎夏迪科、苏联国防部长马利诺夫斯基元帅、外交部长葛罗米柯，以及苏联政府各部门的负责人。
    出席群众大会的还有各国驻苏联的外交使节和在莫斯科学习的我国留学生。
    二时半，刘少奇主席等在勃列日涅夫等苏联党政领导人陪同下登上主席台。这时，全场起立，会场上响起了暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声和欢呼声。
    苏共莫斯科市委第一书记杰米契夫首先在大会上讲话。他代表莫斯科市劳动人民热烈欢迎刘少奇主席和中国党政代表团团员。他说，苏联人民衷心祝贺中国人民在共产党和毛泽东同志领导下所取得的成就。他说，苏中两国人民之间像钢铁般的坚固的友谊，是世界上任何力量也不能动摇的，这种友谊是在两国人民共同斗争中建立起来的。
    杰米契夫宣布大会开始后，乐队高奏中、苏两国国歌。
  莫斯科李哈乔夫汽车工厂工人苏斯特列托夫代表莫斯科工人热烈欢迎中国贵宾。他说，苏中两国人民的友谊像磐石一样的坚固，把我们团结在一起的是战无不胜的马克思列宁主义。我们非常高兴的是，同苏联和社会主义阵营共同前进的有伟大的中国人民。
    苏联科学院院士扬辛代表首都知识界讲话说，苏联人民为中国人民在建设社会主义方面所取得的成就而感到骄傲。苏联人民是中国人民最忠实、最可靠的朋友。
    莫斯科大学学生巴甫洛娃代表莫斯科青年讲话说，苏联人民认为中国人民的每一个成就都是自己的成就，都是整个社会主义阵营的成就。她说，在世界上，河可干、山可平，但是，苏中两国人民的伟大友谊是永恒的、牢不可破的。她最后用中国话高呼：
  “苏中两国人民伟大的兄弟友谊万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”
    接着，苏共中央主席团委员、苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席勃列日涅夫讲了话。
    勃列日涅夫说，中国党政代表团的访问苏联，再一次鲜明地表明苏中友谊的进一步加强和发展。
    他指出，在这些天里，全世界亿万人的注意都集中在各国共产党和工人党代表会议的文件上。他说，会议文件体现了各个马克思列宁主义政党的集体智慧。
    勃列日涅夫着重指出，在这次会议上，各国共产党和工人党规划了社会主义阵营进一步团结的道路，指出了反帝斗争、争取社会进步、争取彻底消灭殖民主义制度和建立各国人民永恒友谊的新的可能性和任务。
    勃列日涅夫说：“苏中两国人民日益加强的团结和友谊，是进一步加强社会主义体系的最重要保证”。他还指出，社会主义体系对现代世界发展的整个进程起着强有力的影响。
    勃列日涅夫强调说，中国人民有着苏联这样一个忠实而可靠的朋友。他引用赫鲁晓夫的话说：“苏联将把帝国主义者对人民中国的侵犯看作是对自己国家的侵犯。”
    勃列日涅夫在谈到苏中友谊的巨大意义时说：“用牢不可破的友谊的纽带连结起来的苏中两国是和平和各国人民安全的不可摧毁的堡垒。”他说，没有任何一种力量能够破坏这种友谊。
    勃列日涅夫表示深信，“蒋介石僵尸”终止沾污联合国的气氛和真正的中国占据在这一组织中应有的席位的日子已经不远了。他还满意地指出，中国政府支持苏联的旨在巩固和平的建议并同苏联一道反对战争挑拨者。
    勃列日涅夫在谈到社会主义国家的团结时说，资产阶级活动家感到不可理解的是，一大批国家在没有强制和压力的情况下，自愿地并完全根据自己的利益在国际事务中执行同一个路线。这些活动家经常是根据资本主义的弱肉强食的旧例来判断社会主义国家的相互关系。
    勃列日涅夫着重指出，整个社会主义大家庭瞻望着未来而帝国主义国家的联盟却沉湎于过去。
    勃列日涅夫说，在争取全人类未来的斗争中，苏中两国人民肩负着特殊的责任。“全世界劳动人民正是把他们的希望寄予我们两国、寄予我们两党”。
    他说，苏中两国人民正在尽一切努力，不辜负这一信任。
    勃列日涅夫讲话后，同刘少奇主席热烈拥抱。
    刘少奇主席接着在大会上讲话。当刘少奇主席走上讲台时，会场上响起了暴风雨般的掌声，与会者高呼“苏中友好万岁！”等口号。
    刘少奇主席在讲话中首先对苏联人民在中国党政代表团访问苏联期间所表现的对中国人民的兄弟般的、真诚的友谊表示衷心的感谢。
    刘少奇主席接着谈到了他在这次访问期间所看到的苏联伟大的共产主义建设成就，并回忆起了他在1921年第一次到苏联所亲身经历的情况。
    刘少奇主席说，中国共产党人从第一天起就把中国革命看成是十月革命的继续。在中国共产党和中国人民的心目中，伟大的苏联一直是良师益友。他说，四十三年来，伟大的苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导下，为建设和捍卫社会主义的苏联，进行着艰苦卓绝的努力，取得了社会主义建设的伟大胜利和卫国战争的伟大胜利。在不长的时期内，一个贫穷落后的俄国就被建设成为一个先进的社会主义强国。这一切奇迹般的成就，增强着和平和社会主义的力量，鼓舞着各国人民争取美好未来的信心。现在，苏联人民在以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联共产党中央委员会的领导下，正在胜利地执行着宏伟的七年计划，开展着全面的共产主义建设，以新的成就吸引着全世界各国广大劳动人民。中国人民衷心祝贺苏联人民在共产主义建设中所取得的一切成就。你们的成就就是我们的成就，我们为此而充满着自豪的感觉。
    刘少奇主席说，伟大的苏联是世界和平的强大堡垒。苏联对社会主义兄弟国家履行着兄弟般的相互援助和合作的义务，积极支持资本主义世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民争取解放的斗争，一贯争取实现不同社会制度国家的和平共处。中国人民坚决支持苏联在国际事务中所实行的这些政策。不久以前，赫鲁晓夫同志率领苏联代表团，和其他社会主义国家代表团一起，在第十五届联合国大会上作了新的有益的努力，来揭露以美国为首的帝国主义集团的侵略和战争的政策，揭露丑恶的殖民主义制度。苏联为了和缓国际紧张局势而提出的全面彻底裁军、禁止核武器等建议，获得了全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的热烈响应和支持。中国人民要感谢赫鲁晓夫同志，因为他在第十五届联合国大会上，坚决主张恢复中国在联合国的合法权利，严正地驳斥了美国对于中国所作的无耻的污蔑和诽谤。
    刘少奇主席在谈到中国社会主义建设的成就后说，中国人民在社会主义建设中，正像过去在革命中一样，从苏联得到了巨大的援助。中国人民永远不会忘记苏联的援助。我愿意再一次向苏联人民表达中国人民的感谢。
    刘少奇主席说，在国际事务中，中国始终不渝地同苏联和其他社会主义兄弟国家一起，尽自己的一切努力，对反对帝国主义、保卫世界和平和争取人类进步的事业作出贡献。在社会主义兄弟国家的关系中，中国将坚持履行自己的国际主义义务，同苏联和所有社会主义兄弟国家实行相互援助和合作。对于亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族民主革命运动和资本主义各国人民的革命斗争，中国坚决地给以积极的同情与支持。中国像所有其他社会主义国家一样，一贯奉行和平外交政策，主张在五项原则基础上实现不同社会制度国家之间的和平共处，为缓和国际紧张局势而努力。中国将永远同整个社会主义阵营站在一起，同一切爱好和平的国家和人民站在一起，为世界和平事业的胜利奋斗到底。
    刘少奇主席接着谈到了最近在莫斯科举行的世界各国共产党和工人党代表会议。他说，这次会议一致通过了声明和告世界人民书，这是继1957年莫斯科会议及其宣言以来又一个具有重大历史意义的事件。昨天发表的这次会议的声明，重申了1957年莫斯科宣言，总结了三年来国际形势的发展，阐明了国际共产主义运动面临的许多重大问题，提出了各国共产党和工人党今后的战斗任务。毫无疑问，这次会议的结果，将进一步加强社会主义阵营的团结和整个国际共产主义运动的团结，进一步鼓舞全世界一切革命的进步的人民和所有爱好自由与和平的力量，把全世界人民争取和平、民主、民族解放和社会主义的事业推向新的更加伟大的胜利。
    刘少奇主席说，现在，各国人民争取世界和平、民族解放、民主自由和社会主义的斗争，已经发展到一个新高涨的阶段。和平力量超过了战争力量，进步力量超过了反动力量，社会主义力量超过了帝国主义力量。我们面前，呈现着和平、民主、民族解放和社会主义事业的光明前景。正在建设社会主义和共产主义的占世界三分之一人口的人民，和资本主义世界卷入工人阶级革命运动、民族民主运动和一般民主运动的各国人民，已经汇合成为冲击帝国主义世界体系的一般洪流。我们一方面看到，帝国主义的本性没有改变，新的世界战争的危险还没有过去，世界人民必须保持特别高度的警惕。同时我们又看到，由于国际阶级力量对比的变化，依靠当代维护和平事业的强大力量的联合斗争，在我们的时代是有可能防止帝国主义发动世界战争。尽管以美国为首的帝国主义还在顽固而狂热地进行着扩军备战和侵略的活动，但是，只要世界人民进一步行动起来，组成反对帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策的国际统一战线，同以美国为首的帝国主义集团进行坚持不懈的斗争，就一定能够制止帝国主义发动世界战争，保卫住世界和平。刘少奇主席说，在各国人民争取世界和平、民族解放、民主自由和社会主义事业的斗争中，社会主义阵营的团结和国际共产主义运动的团结是取得胜利的最重要保证。团结就是生命，团结就是力量，团结就是胜利。我们越是团结，世界人民就越高兴，越是受到鼓舞，越是能够增强对自己力量的信心。
    刘主席强调说，中国共产党和苏联共产党是国际共产主义运动中两个最大的党，中国和苏联是社会主义阵营中两个最大的国家，两党、两国对于我们的共同事业也负有特别重大的责任，两党两国的团结也就具有特别重大的意义。我们的共同敌人——以美国为首的帝国主义者总是千方百计地企图破坏中苏之间的团结。但是，就像看不到太阳从西边出来一样，他们永远也看不到中苏两个伟大的党、伟大的国家、伟大的人民之间的分离。我们的团结是由共同理想和共同事业联系起来的，是在对共同敌人的共同斗争中发展和巩固起来的，是以马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义为基础的。这种伟大团结，久经风暴的考验，世界上没有任何力量能够破坏它。全世界都可以看到，在反对帝国主义和实现共产主义的共同斗争中，无论风里，雨里，中国人民都将永远同苏联人民站在一起。我坚决相信，中国共产党和苏联共产党，中国人民和苏联人民，将像保护自己眼珠一样，永远坚定不移地保护我们两党两国人民的团结。让我们在马克思列宁主义的伟大旗帜下，为我们共同事业的胜利，更加紧密地团结起来，并肩前进吧！
    刘少奇主席的讲话多次被暴风雨般的掌声所打断。
    刘少奇主席讲话后，同勃列日涅夫同志和杰米契夫同志热烈拥抱，全场响起经久不息的掌声和欢呼声。刘少奇主席和中国党政代表团团员同苏联党政领导人一起携起手来，充分地显示了中苏两国人民伟大的、牢不可破的友谊。
    大会自始至终在友好、团结、热情高涨的气氛中进行。
    会后，放映了中苏两国合拍的影片《风从东方来》。（附图片）
