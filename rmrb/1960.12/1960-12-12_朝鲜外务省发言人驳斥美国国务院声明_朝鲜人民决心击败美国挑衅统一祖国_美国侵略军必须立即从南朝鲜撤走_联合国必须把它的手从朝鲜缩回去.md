Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 11th:

    A spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) issued a statement today refuting the US State Department’s December 7th “statement” opposing the peaceful reunification of Korea. The full text of the DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesperson’s statement is as follows:

    On December 7th, the US State Department issued a blatant statement opposing the peaceful reunification of Korea, once again exposing the aggressive nature of US imperialism.

    In this statement, the US imperialists repeated the shameless sophistry that the US imperialist aggressor troops’ occupation of South Korea was seemingly based on “UN resolutions” and for military “defense,” naively attempting to evade criminal responsibility for obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea and plunging the South Korean people into misery.

    However, no matter what, the US imperialists cannot conceal their true colors as aggressors and colonial plunderers of Korea.

    For US imperialists to cross the ocean, forcibly occupy other countries, and then talk about “defense” is nothing but a shameless sophistry to continue occupying South Korea, intensify preparations for new war provocations against the Korean people, and suppress the South Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their fatherland.

    The so-called “UN resolutions” that the US imperialists constantly clamor about are criminal and illegal fabrications created to cover up their aggression and plunder of Korea. This is a fact that cannot deceive anyone.

    The master of Korea is not the US imperialists, but the Korean people.

    All undeniable facts prove more clearly that the peaceful reunification of Korea can only be achieved by withdrawing the US imperialist aggressor troops from South Korea.

    The root cause of Korea's division and the misfortune and suffering endured by the South Korean people lies in the US imperialist occupation of South Korea and its aggressive policies.

    From the first day of its occupation of South Korea, US imperialism has consistently pursued its colonial plunder policies and war policies, and has done everything possible to suppress and obstruct the Korean people's struggle for the reunification, independence, and freedom of their fatherland.

    If the US imperialists had not occupied South Korea and crudely interfered in Korea's internal affairs, and if there had been no US imperialist war of aggression against the Korean people, Korea would have been reunified long ago, and the Korean people would have been living happily as one family.

    However, US imperialism continues to obstruct the implementation of the consistent peaceful reunification plan of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, brutally tramples on the armistice agreement it signed, and intensifies preparations for new war provocations in South Korea.

    Regardless of this obstructionist conspiracy by US imperialism, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea continues to make sincere efforts for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland.

    On the occasion of the fifteenth anniversary of the “August 15th” liberation this year, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, considering that the South Korean authorities have not yet accepted the general North-South Korean elections for the peaceful reunification of Korea, proposed a plan for implementing a North-South Korean confederation as a transitional measure. The Eighth Session of the Second Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, accordingly, put forward a specific programmatic plan to promote the peaceful reunification of the fatherland and salvage the bankrupt situation in South Korea.

    This plan has aroused enormous response among the entire Korean people and peace-loving people all over the world, and has received their active support.

    Alarmed by this development, the US imperialists have more brutally interfered in South Korea's internal affairs, cruelly suppressing the South Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their fatherland.

    The US imperialist tool of aggression in Seoul—the "United Nations Command"—in order to prevent the South Korean authorities from being "attracted" by the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, used its "influence" and shamelessly clamored that if the South Korean authorities wanted to consult with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, they must obtain "prior permission from the United Nations Command."

    However, as is well known, the South Korean people have not been intimidated by such arrogant words from US imperialism. They have mobilized against "elections under UN supervision" and the US imperialist colonial rule created by the results of this "election," and have strengthened their struggle to force the withdrawal of US imperialist aggressor troops from South Korea and to achieve the peaceful reunification of the country in order to fight for freedom and liberation, for a new politics and a new life.

    Does US imperialism still dare to legitimize its occupation of South Korea today? Can it still cover up its bloody crimes against the Korean people?

    US imperialism must stop its shameless and absurd clamoring and immediately withdraw its aggressor troops from South Korea.

    The US imperialist aggressor troops have no basis or excuse to remain in South Korea.

    The US imperialist tool of aggression—the "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea"—must be dissolved, and the United Nations must take its hands off Korea.

    As a belligerent in the Korean War, the United Nations has no basis for interfering in the Korean issue in any form.

    The Korean people will never allow any country or organization to interfere in Korea's internal affairs.

    The master of Korea is the Korean people, and the Korean issue must be resolved peacefully by the Korean people themselves without any external interference.

    Today, the Korean people are filled with a strong determination to peacefully reunify their fatherland.

    Any provocative conspiracy by US imperialism against the Korean people will inevitably be bankrupted.

### 朝鲜外务省发言人驳斥美国国务院声明  朝鲜人民决心击败美国挑衅统一祖国  美国侵略军必须立即从南朝鲜撤走  联合国必须把它的手从朝鲜缩回去

    朝鲜外务省发言人驳斥美国国务院声明
    朝鲜人民决心击败美国挑衅统一祖国
    美国侵略军必须立即从南朝鲜撤走  联合国必须把它的手从朝鲜缩回去
    新华社平壤11日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省发言人今天发表声明，驳斥美国国务院7日发表的反对朝鲜的和平统一的“声明”。朝鲜外务省发言人的声明全文如下：
    12月7日，美国国务院发表了反对朝鲜的和平统一、又一次暴露美帝国主义侵略本性的粗暴的声明。
    美帝国主义者在这个声明中重复了美帝国主义侵略军强占南朝鲜似乎是根据
  “联合国的决议”，是为了军事“防御”的厚颜无耻的诡辩，幼稚地企图逃避阻挠和平统一朝鲜、把南朝鲜人民推入水深火热之中的犯罪责任。
    但是，美帝国主义者不论如何也无法掩盖它作为朝鲜的侵略者和殖民地掠夺者的真面目。
    美帝国主义者渡过大洋，强占别的国家还说什么“防御”，这不过是为了继续强占南朝鲜，加紧反对朝鲜人民的新战争挑衅准备，镇压南朝鲜人民争取和平统一祖国的斗争的厚颜无耻的诡辩。
    美帝国主义者口口声声叫嚷的所谓“联合国决议”，是它为了掩盖对朝鲜的侵略和掠夺，犯罪地、非法地捏造的谎言。这是欺骗不了任何人的事实。
    朝鲜的主人不是美帝国主义者而是朝鲜人。
    一切俨然的事实都更加清楚地证明，只有使美帝国主义侵略军从南朝鲜撤走，才能实现朝鲜的和平统一。
    朝鲜的分裂和南朝鲜人民经受的不幸和痛苦的根源就在于美帝国主义强占南朝鲜和它的侵略政策。
    美帝国主义从强占南朝鲜的第一天起，就一贯推行其殖民地掠夺政策和战争政策，并千方百计地镇压和阻挠朝鲜人民争取祖国的统一、独立和自由的斗争。
    如果，美帝国主义者没有强占南朝鲜，对朝鲜问题不粗暴地干涉内政，如果没有美帝国主义反对朝鲜人民的侵略战争，朝鲜早就统一了，朝鲜人民早就幸福地生活在一个家庭里了。
    但是，美帝国主义继续阻挠着朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的始终一贯的和平统一国家的方案的实现，粗暴地蹂躏它签了字的停战协定，在南朝鲜更加疯狂地进行新战争挑衅准备。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府不顾美帝国主义的这种阻挠阴谋，为了和平统一祖国，继续进行着有诚意的努力。
    在今年“八·一五”解放十五周年之际，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府考虑到南朝鲜当局还不接受和平统一朝鲜的南北朝鲜总选举的情况，作为过渡措施，提出了关于实施南北朝鲜联邦制的方案。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国第二届最高人民会议第八次会议据此提出了促进祖国的和平统一，收拾南朝鲜破产局面的具体的纲领性方案。
    这一方案在全体朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平人民中引起了巨大的反应，并得到了他们的积极的支持。
    对这一局势的发展感到惊慌失措的美帝国主义者更加粗暴地干涉南朝鲜的内政，残酷地镇压着南朝鲜人民争取和平统一祖国的斗争。
    美帝国主义在汉城的侵略工具——“联合国军司令部”为了使南朝鲜当局“不被”朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的提案所“吸引”，使用自己的“影响”，并厚颜无耻地叫嚷说，如果南朝鲜当局想同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国协商，就必须得到“联合国军司令部的事先许可”。
    但是，众所周知，南朝鲜人民并没有因为美帝国主义的这种狂妄的言语所吓倒，他们为反对“联合国监督下的选举”和这个“选举”结果制造出来的美帝国主义殖民统治机构，为了争取自由和解放、新政治和新生活，动员起来了，并加强了使美帝国主义侵略军撤出南朝鲜，争取和平统一国家的斗争。
    美帝国主义者如今还敢把强占南朝鲜合法化吗？还能掩盖它那反对朝鲜人民的沾满鲜血的罪状吗？
    美帝国主义必须停止厚颜无耻的荒唐的叫嚣，立即从南朝鲜撤走它的侵略军。
    美帝国主义侵略军没有任何根据和借口赖在南朝鲜。
    美帝国主义的侵略工具——“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”必须解散，联合国必须把它的手从朝鲜缩回去。
    作为朝鲜战争的交战一方的联合国，没有任何根据以任何形式干涉朝鲜问题。
    朝鲜人民决不容许任何国家或机构干涉朝鲜的内政。
    朝鲜的主人是朝鲜人民，朝鲜问题必须在没有任何外部的干涉的条件下，由朝鲜人民自己来和平解决。
    今天，朝鲜人民充满着一定要和平统一祖国的坚强的决心。
    美帝国主义反对朝鲜人民的任何挑衅阴谋将必不可免地遭到破产。
