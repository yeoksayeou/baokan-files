Tianjin Animal By-Products Company Fur Factory

Runs Old Worker Training Class

    (By our newspaper) The amateur technical training class for old workers run by the Tianjin Animal By-Products Company Fur Factory, through the method of combining theory with practice and summarizing production experience, has improved the technical and theoretical level of the workers, playing an important role in carrying out technical innovations and ensuring the completion of production plans.

    The old workers in this factory account for about two-thirds of the total number of employees. In order to summarize and improve their technical experience, and pass on this experience to young workers, the factory has opened four professional technical training classes according to production characteristics: leather finishing, horsehair processing, combing and dyeing, and cutting and tailoring. The 98 old workers participating in the study all have more than 20 years of work experience and are rich in production experience. In addition to learning basic courses such as Chinese, physics, and chemistry, they also specialize in one field according to their personal strengths, so their technical theory has improved rapidly. At the same time, because the study is also closely integrated with the key to production for research, it has greatly promoted production. In the study, the old workers in the second workshop summarized a set of operating methods for processing horsehair, which increased the finished product rate of horsehair from 70% to 83%. The thirty or so old workers in the technical study class of the fifth workshop also summarized a set of operating methods of "skillfully using materials and skillfully allocating work" in response to the shortcomings of inaccurate scaling, excessive material input, emphasis on output rather than quality, and emphasis on quality without considering economy when cutting and tailoring fur. After the entire workshop promoted this operation method, the rabbit skins saved in October alone were used to make 1,440 fur coats.

    After the technical and theoretical level of the old workers was significantly improved through study, they summarized their experience one after another. Old workers Song Zhanting, Sun Xiukun, Wang Wenrui, and others, with the help of teachers from the spare-time school, spent more than five months compiling a "Leather Studies" textbook of about 200,000 words based on their more than 20 years of production experience.

    天津畜产公司皮毛厂
    办老工人训练班
    本报讯　天津市畜产公司皮毛厂开办的老工人业余技术学习班，通过理论联系实际的方法，总结生产经验，提高了工人的技术理论水平，对开展技术革新保证完成生产计划起了重要作用。
    这个厂的老工人约占全厂职工总数的三分之二。为了总结和提高他们的技术经验，并把这些经验传授给青年工人，厂里根据生产特点，开办了皮张整理、马尾加工、梳染、裁制等四个专业技术学习班。参加学习的九十八名老工人，都有二十多年工龄，生产经验丰富。他们除了学习语文、理化等基础课程以外，还结合个人专长，专精一门，因此技术理论方面提高得很快。同时，由于在学习中还紧密结合生产关键进行研究，促使生产大大提高。二车间老工人们在学习中，总结出加工马尾的一套操作方法，使马尾的成品率由70％提高到83％。五车间技术学习班的三十多名老工人，还针对裁制皮毛时打尺不准、投料偏多、重产量不重质量、重质量不顾节约等缺点，总结出一套“巧用料、巧配活”的操作方法。全车间职工推广这种操作方法以后，仅10月份节省的兔皮就制成皮大衣一千四百四十件。
    老工人通过学习，技术理论水平显著提高以后，纷纷总结自己的经验。老工人宋湛亭和孙秀坤、王文瑞等，在业余学校教师的帮助下，经过五个多月的努力，把他们二十多年的生产经验编写成了一部约二十万字的“皮张学”教材。
