Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 30th. Hubei Province's Anlu County health departments are organizing medical personnel to carry "medicine peddler's loads" to the countryside, implementing diagnosis, treatment, dispensing medicine, and providing care at the forefront of production, which has been well-received by the masses.

They organize medical personnel into medical and nursing teams, carrying necessary medical equipment and a wide variety of traditional Chinese and Western medicines, to the forefront of production to prevent and treat various diseases and conduct health education. Previously, the medical personnel in this county who went to the countryside for mobile medical services generally only carried a health kit, with a small number of medical devices and limited medicines, which could not fully meet the needs of production and the masses. Now, by adopting this method, it is possible to further facilitate the masses, and both minor and major illnesses and work-related injuries can be treated promptly and locally. In the previous period, in order to meet the needs of the "Three Autumns" (autumn harvesting, plowing, and sowing) production, health departments at all levels in Anlu County transferred more than 350 medical personnel, organized complete medical and nursing teams, carried "medicine peddler's loads," and adopted the method of dividing areas of responsibility and assigning specific areas, going deep into the fields, public canteens, and villages to extensively carry out disease prevention, examination, and treatment activities, which achieved remarkable results. Dong Tian'an, a member of the Tuqiao Production Team of the Yitang Commune, suddenly fell ill while working in the fields. After timely and effective treatment by the mobile medical personnel, he quickly recovered his health. The commune members were very touched. At the same time, the medical personnel also combined with production to carry out health education and autumn and winter mass disease prevention activities, and strengthened hygiene management work with public canteens as the center.

After the medical personnel in Anlu County went to the countryside, they all ate, lived, and labored with the masses. The medical personnel who went to various production teams of the Lidian Commune engaged in sanitation, accumulated fertilizer, and delivered fertilizer. The medical personnel of the Yitang Commune used the gaps in their work to labor with the commune members, earning more than 1,600 work points. Li Guiben, a doctor at the Xinjie Health Center, patrolled the fields for medical treatment every day, enthusiastically serving the health of the masses, and became a confidant of the commune members.

    肩挑“药郎担”农村巡回治病
    安陆白衣战士送药上门受到欢迎
    新华社武汉30日电　湖北省安陆县卫生部门组织医务人员挑着“药郎担”下乡，实行诊断、治疗、发药、护理到生产第一线，受到群众欢迎。
    他们将医务人员组成医疗、护理班子，挑着必要的医疗器械和品种较多的中西药担子，到生产第一线防治各种疾病，进行卫生宣传。以前，这个县下乡巡回医疗的医务人员，一般只背个保健箱，带少数的医疗器械和有限的药品，不能完全适应生产和群众的需要。现在采取这种办法，就能进一步便利群众，大小病和工伤就都能及时就地治疗。前一时期，为了适应“三秋”生产的需要，安陆县各级卫生部门抽调了三百五十多名医务人员，组成医疗、护理成套的班子，挑着“药郎担”，采取划区负责、分片包干的办法，深入田间、公共食堂、村庄，广泛地开展防病、查病、治病的活动，收到了显著成效。义堂公社土桥生产队社员董天安在田间生产时，突然生病，经巡回医务人员及时有效的治疗，很快恢复了健康。社员们很受感动。与此同时，医务人员们还结合生产，开展卫生宣传和秋冬季群众性防病活动，并且以公共食堂为中心，加强了卫生管理工作。
    安陆县医务人员们下乡后，都与群众同吃、同住、同劳动。下到李店公社各生产队的医务人员，边搞卫生，边积肥，边送肥。义堂公社的医务人员利用工作间隙，和社员们一起劳动，做了一千六百多工分。新街卫生所医生李贵本，每天在田间巡回医疗，热情地为群众的健康服务，成了社员的知心朋友。（附图片）
