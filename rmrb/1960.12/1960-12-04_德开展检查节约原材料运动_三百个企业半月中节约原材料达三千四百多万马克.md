Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 3rd: A campaign to inspect and save raw materials has recently been launched in the German Democratic Republic. According to preliminary statistics, during this half-month campaign, approximately 300 enterprises have already saved raw materials worth over 34.6 million marks. By the end of this year or the beginning of next year, it is expected that raw materials worth another 22.3 million marks will be saved.

The purpose of this campaign to inspect and save raw materials is to further promote the implementation of the call by the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party to conserve raw materials in all aspects. The campaign was initiated by workers at the Finsterwalde Machine Factory in early November. This initiative received support from the "Neues Deutschland," the organ of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party, and was promoted and disseminated.

During this campaign, some factory workers combined technological innovations to save raw materials. Fifteen socialist labor collectives at the Leipzig Steel Plant changed their steel casting models, saving a significant amount of crude steel. Three production teams at the Wilhelm Florin Steel and Rolling Mill in Hennigsdorf reduced the chromium content in bearing steel, saving approximately 200,000 marks worth of chromium by the end of this year.

Workers not only paid attention to saving important raw materials such as steel, non-ferrous metals, wood, and textile raw materials, but also to saving auxiliary materials. Workers at the state-owned Rafena Radeberg factory pledged to save materials such as alcohol, paint, and grease. Saving on auxiliary materials will reduce production costs. Many factories also paid special attention to saving imported raw materials.

In addition to paying attention to saving during the production process, improving designs is also an important aspect of saving raw materials. Engineers at the state-owned Ruhla Electric Vehicle Manufacturing Plant improved the design of a component inside a locomotive, saving 60,000 marks worth of cast iron. A carpentry team at the Dresden State Construction Company simplified the design of scaffolding, saving 120 cubic meters of wood annually.

Some factories and enterprises also started with small things, paying attention to the utilization of scraps and waste materials. Female workers at the Sonnenberg State Clothing Factory used scraps to make more than 200 sets of men's clothing. The Eisenach Automobile Factory and other factories collected lead and copper shavings and reused them.

This campaign to inspect and save raw materials concluded on November 26th.

### 德开展检查节约原材料运动  三百个企业半月中节约原材料达三千四百多万马克

    德开展检查节约原材料运动
    三百个企业半月中节约原材料达三千四百多万马克
    据新华社柏林3日电　在德意志民主共和国最近开展了一个检查节约原材料的运动，据初步统计，在这个为期半个月的运动中，在约三百个企业中，已经节约了价值三千四百六十多万马克的原材料。到今年年底或明年年初，将再节约价值两千二百三十多万马克的原材料。
    这个检查节约原材料的运动的目的在于进一步推动各方面贯彻执行统一社会党中央提出的节约原材料的号召。运动是由芬斯特瓦尔德机器制造厂的工人在11月初倡议发起的。这个倡议得到了统一社会党中央委员会机关报《新德意志报》的支持，并加以宣传推广。
    在这次运动中，一些工厂的职工结合技术革新节约了原材料。来比锡钢铁厂十五个社会主义劳动集体改变了铸钢模型，节约了大量原钢。赫宁斯多夫的威廉·弗洛林炼钢和轧钢厂三个生产队降低了轴承钢中的铬量，到今年年底大约可以节约价值二十万马克的铬。
    工人们不仅注意节约钢铁、有色金属、木材、纺织原料等重要原材料，而且还注意节约辅助材料。国营拉法纳·拉德堡工厂的工人保证要节约酒精、油漆、脂肪等材料。由于辅助材料的节约，将使生产成本降低。许多工厂还特别注意了进口原材料的节约。
    除了在生产过程中注意节约之外，改进设计也是节约原材料的一个重要方面。国营鲁赫拉电气车辆制造厂的工程师改进了机车内的一个部件的设计，就节约了价值六万马克的铸铁。德累斯顿国营建筑公司的一个木工队简化了脚手架的设计，每年可节约一百二十立方米的木料。
    一些工厂企业还从小处着手，注意利用零头废料。松纳堡国营被服厂的女工就这样利用零头材料制成了二百多套男子服装。埃塞纳希汽车制造厂和其他一些工厂把铅屑、铜屑收集起来，重新加以利用。
    这次检查节约原材料运动到11月26日已告一段落。
