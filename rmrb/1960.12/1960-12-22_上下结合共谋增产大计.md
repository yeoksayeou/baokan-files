    Joint Efforts from Above and Below to Plan for Increased Production

    On December 17th, the Zhejiang Daily published an editorial titled "A Very Good Leadership Method." The editorial stated that the experience of the Caijia Production Team of Qinghu Commune in Jiangshan County in mobilizing the masses to formulate next year's production plan was very good.

    The following is a summary:

    In leading current agricultural production, how can we achieve both active leadership and allow the masses to be the masters of their own affairs; adhere to the Party's guidelines and policies, act in accordance with the national plan, and at the same time, adhere to seeking truth from facts and adapting to local conditions? The experience of the Caijia Production Team of Qinghu Commune in Jiangshan County in mobilizing the masses to formulate next year's production plan provides a good answer to this question.

    When leading the masses to formulate a production plan, the Caijia Production Team did four things: First, it summarized the experiences and lessons of the two production teams in formulating the annual production plan last year, resolving the issue of the cadres' mass perspective. Second, it went to the masses and publicized the three guiding ideologies for formulating next year's production plan: the idea of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing production; the idea of planting more high-yield crops to reap more harvests; and the idea of striving for next year's production to exceed any previous year. It revealed the Party's guidelines, policies, and requirements to the masses. Third, it boldly mobilized the masses to speak out and debate, analyze the current excellent situation and the favorable conditions for striving for continuous leaps forward in agricultural production next year, and encouraged the masses' confidence in increasing production. Fourth, it guided the masses to summarize their high-yield experiences in the past few years, analyze the reasons for high yields, compare them with this year's conditions, tap production potential, and find effective methods to achieve increased production. The effect of doing so was very good. The production plan was entirely formulated by the masses themselves, and at the same time, it reflected the guiding ideology put forward by the leadership. The commune leadership did not propose specific targets, but the results of each target exceeded the leadership's original expected goals.

    In the process of formulating the production plan, the Caijia Production Team revealed the Party's guidelines, policies, and tasks to the masses, "so that the masses recognize their own interests and unite to strive for the realization of their own interests." As a result, the Party's guidelines and policies became the actions of the masses, and everyone acted in accordance with the Party's guidelines and policies, working together to develop production. Their mobilization of the masses to formulate the production plan made the masses truly feel that they were the masters of their own affairs, and thus greatly increased their enthusiasm for production. They guided the masses to analyze favorable conditions, summarize high-yield experiences, and tap production potential, which greatly promoted the revolutionary spirit of the masses striving for progress and mobilized all positive factors conducive to increased production. They did a lot of work, which can be summarized as doing one thing, that is, grasping ideology, grasping policy, boldly mobilizing the masses, and fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses.

    In leading production, there is a fundamental issue of understanding to be resolved: developing production is the masses' own business and also the masses' urgent demand. We must believe that the masses have the enthusiasm to work hard to develop production and rely on the wisdom and strength of the masses to develop production. The task of the leadership is not only to put forward some specific targets and measures to the masses, but more importantly, to mobilize the production enthusiasm of the masses. Grasping this fundamental will make the work go smoothly; failing to grasp this fundamental will inevitably make the work passive. Some comrades believe that if the plan is formulated by the masses themselves, the role of the leadership will be lost. This view is incorrect. Publicizing the Party's guidelines and policies to the masses, leading the masses to discuss how to achieve the Party's tasks, and helping the masses summarize high-yield experiences are precisely active leadership.

    Can a production plan formulated by the masses themselves be both active and reliable? The experience of the Caijia Production Team proves that as long as the masses are fully mobilized, the local advanced experience is carefully summarized, the idea of going all out and striving for progress is established among the masses, and a typical example of adhering to the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture and achieving high yields is established, there will be a correct guiding ideology, and it can definitely be both active and reliable. The experience of the Caijia Production Team is a good proof: the leadership's preliminary plan was not proposed to the masses, but the plan formulated by the masses themselves exceeded the leadership's original plan.

    上下结合共谋增产大计
    12月17日，浙江日报以“一种很好的领导方法”为题发表社论。社论认为，江山县清湖公社蔡家生产队发
    动群众制订明年生产规划的经验很好。
    摘要如下：
    在领导当前农业生产中，如何做到既有积极领导，又让群众当家作主；既坚持党的方针、政策，按照国家计划办事，又坚持实事求是，因地制宜。江山县清湖公社蔡家生产队发动群众制订明年生产规划的经验，很好地回答了这个问题。
    蔡家生产队在领导群众制订生产规划的时候，做了四件事情：第一，总结了两个生产小队去年制订全年生产规划的经验和教训，解决干部的群众观点问题。第二，到群众中去，向群众宣传了制订明年生产规划的三个指导思想：以粮为纲，全面发展生产的思想；多种高产多收的思想；力争明年的生产超过以往任何一年的思想。把党的方针、政策和要求向群众交底。第三，放手发动群众鸣放辩论，分析当前大好形势和争取明年农业生产持续跃进的有利条件，鼓舞群众的增产信心。第四，引导群众总结过去几年中的高产经验，分析高产原因，对比今年的条件，大挖生产潜力，找到实现增产的有效方法。这样做的效果很好。生产规划完全是由群众自己订出来的，同时又体现了领导上所提出来的指导思想；公社领导上并没有提出具体的指标，结果各项指标都超过了领导上原来预期的目的。
    蔡家生产队在制订生产规划的过程中，把党的方针、政策和任务向群众交底，“使群众认识自己的利益，并且团结起来，为实现自己的利益而奋斗”，结果是党的方针政策变成了群众的行动，大家按照党的方针、政策办事，齐心协力来发展生产。他们发动群众制订生产规划，群众真正感到自己在当家作主了，因而生产积极性大大提高；他们引导群众分析有利条件，总结高产经验，大挖增产潜力，结果是大大发扬了群众力争上游的革命精神，调动了一切有利于增产的积极因素。他们做了许多工作，归纳起来是做了一件工作，这就是抓思想，抓政策，放手发动群众，充分调动了干部和群众的积极性。
    在领导生产中，有一个根本性的认识问题要解决：发展生产是群众自己的事情，也是群众的迫切要求。我们一定要相信群众有努力发展生产的积极性，并且依靠群众的智慧和力量去发展生产。领导上的任务不仅在于要向群众提出一些具体的指标和措施，更重要的在于调动群众的生产积极性。抓住了这个根本，工作就会势如破竹；抓不住这个根本，工作必然被动。有的同志认为，规划由群众自己去订，领导的作用就没有了。这种看法是不正确的。向群众宣传党的方针、政策，领导群众讨论如何实现党的任务，帮助群众总结高产经验等，正是积极的领导。
    生产规划由群众自己订，能不能够订得既积极又可靠？蔡家生产队的经验证明，只要充分发动群众，认真总结当地的先进经验，在群众中树立鼓足干劲、力争上游的思想，树立坚持八字宪法、获得高产的典型，有一个正确的指导思想，就一定可以订得既积极又可靠。蔡家生产队的经验，就是很好的证明：领导上的初步规划并没有向群众提出，而群众自己订的规划却超过了领导上原来的规划。
