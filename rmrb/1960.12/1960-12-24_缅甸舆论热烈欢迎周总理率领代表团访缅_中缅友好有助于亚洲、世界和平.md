Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, December 23rd: Burmese public opinion warmly welcomes the friendly visit to Burma by the People's Republic of China delegation led by Premier Zhou Enlai. They unanimously believe that this friendly visit will further deepen the "Pauk-Phaw" (fraternal) feelings between the people of China and Burma and will contribute to Asian and world peace.

The Burma National United Front issued a statement on the 22nd, pointing out that the visit of the People's Republic of China's friendly delegation to Burma will further strengthen relations between China and Burma.

The statement said that China and Burma have already concluded a treaty of friendship and mutual non-aggression and a boundary treaty. During the visit of the Chinese friendly delegation to Burma, the two governments will exchange instruments of ratification for the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty. The statement pointed out that although China and Burma have different social systems, the two countries have, in practice, observed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence between countries with different social systems, which they jointly initiated. Therefore, the boundary between the two countries is not a boundary that creates division between the two peoples, nor is it a boundary that creates tension between the two countries, nor is it a boundary that will forever erupt in flames of war and please the imperialists, but it is a boundary that realizes the unity of the two peoples, a boundary that contributes to friendship between the two countries, and a boundary of peace.

The statement said, "The cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Burma has been greatly strengthened and consolidated due to mutual respect for sovereignty. Therefore, this will be of great help to the peace of Asia and the whole world."

The Mandalay newspaper "Bahosi" recently published a commentary pointing out that the complete resolution of the Sino-Burmese border issue left over by imperialism has enabled the friendship between China and Burma to enter a new stage. "From now on, China and Burma will happily move forward hand in hand on a flat and broad road."

The commentary said, "In the past, we lived under imperialist rule. At that time, although we were neighboring countries with contiguous territories, we had no right to visit each other and could not exchange the cultures and arts of the two countries." "Now, the people of our two countries have been liberated from the iron heels of imperialism. We are now able to freely visit and exchange culture with each other. Therefore, we feel particularly happy when we meet our Chinese 'Pauk-Phaw' again."

The commentary pointed out, "Every Burmese who has visited China cannot help but praise the hospitality of the Chinese people. We will never forget the deep 'Pauk-Phaw' feelings of the Chinese people towards the Burmese people."

The commentary concluded, "Our Chinese friends will soon come to Burma as guests, and we will give them a warm welcome and grand reception."

The famous Burmese film director and writer U Win Naing recently published an article warmly welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai and the delegation of more than 400 people he leads on their upcoming visit to Burma.

He said that for many centuries, the people of neighboring China and Burma have been conducting friendly exchanges. Since China and Burma gained independence, the friendly relations between the two countries have developed greatly.

He said that the Burmese people are very happy to see the leap forward progress of the Chinese people after liberation. He praised the united efforts of the Chinese people and their diligence and discipline.

    缅甸舆论热烈欢迎周总理率领代表团访缅
    中缅友好有助于亚洲、世界和平
    民族团结阵线指出：
    中缅两国的边界不是在两国人民中间制造分裂的边界，也不是造成两国之间紧张关系的边界，更不是永远爆发烽火而使帝国主义者感到高兴的边界，而成为实现两国人民的团结的边界，成为有助于两国友好的边界，成为和平的边界
    新华社仰光23日电　缅甸公众舆论热烈欢迎由周恩来总理率领的中华人民共和国访问缅甸联邦友好代表团将对缅甸作友好访问。他们一致认为，这次的友好访问将进一步加深中缅两国人民之间的“胞波”感情，并将有助于亚洲和世界和平。
    缅甸民族团结阵线22日发表声明指出，中华人民共和国友好代表团对缅甸的访问将进一步加强中缅两国的关系。
    声明说，中国和缅甸已经缔结了友好和互不侵犯条约和边界条约。在中国友好代表团到缅甸访问时，两国政府将互换关于中缅边界条约的批准书。声明指出，尽管中缅两国社会制度不同，但是两国在实践中遵守了它们曾经共同倡议的不同社会制度国家之间的和平共处五项原则。因此，两国的边界不是在两国人民中间制造分裂的边界，也不是造成两国之间紧张关系的边界，更不是永远爆发烽火而使帝国主义者感到高兴的边界，而成为实现两国人民的团结的边界，成为有助于两国友好的边界，成为和平的边界。
    声明说，“中华人民共和国和缅甸联邦之间的合作，由于相互尊重主权，而大大地密切和巩固了。因此，这对于亚洲和全世界的和平，将有极大的帮助。”
    曼德勒《巴霍西报》最近发表评论指出，由于完全解决了帝国主义遗留下来的中缅边界问题，使得中缅两国的友谊进入了一个新的阶段。“今后，中国和缅甸将愉快地在平坦和广阔的道路上携手前进。”
    评论说，“过去，我们在帝国主义统治下生活。在那个时候，我们虽然是国土相连的邻国，但是我们无权进行互相访问，不能交流两国的文化和艺术。”“现在，我们两国人民已经从帝国主义的铁蹄下解放出来。我们现在能够自由地相互访问和交流文化。因此，当我们再一次同我们的中国‘胞波’会面时，我们感到特别高兴。”
    评论指出，“每一个访问过中国的缅甸人都不禁要赞扬中国人民的殷勤好客。我们终生难忘中国人民对缅甸人民的深厚的‘胞波’感情。”
    评论最后说，“中国朋友不久将来缅甸作客，我们将给予热烈的欢迎和盛大的接待。”
    缅甸著名电影导演、作家吴迎纳最近发表文章，热烈欢迎周恩来总理和他所率领的由四百多人组成的代表团不久对缅甸的访问。
    他说，许多世纪以来，相邻的中缅两国人民就一直进行着友好往来。自从中缅两国获得独立以来，两国的友好关系有了很大的发展。
    他说，缅甸人民很高兴看到中国人民在解放以后的飞跃进步。他赞扬了中国人民团结一致的努力以及他们的勤劳和遵守纪律的精神。
