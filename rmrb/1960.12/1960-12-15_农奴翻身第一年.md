A wide and winding river flows down from the towering mountains. This majestic Xiongqu River, hundreds of miles long, leads directly to the Yarlung Zangbo River. On the left bank of the river in the Lhagari area, stand three tall buildings side by side. These are the homes of the three major aristocratic families—the Shannan Wang family, the Xiajiang family, and the Xialuo family—the direct rulers who enslaved the laboring people of Lhagari for generations. Inside the river滩 area, the trees are lush and verdant. Among them, the Shannan Wang Park was built with the blood and sweat of the laboring people, featuring a magnificent royal residence and auxiliary chambers. In the Xialuo area, there are eleven villages along the river, inhabited by one hundred and twenty-six households. Their ancestors have toiled on this large flat area of fifteen hundred Ke, but for generations, they have suffered the inhumane rule, oppression, and exploitation of the Xialuo Zongben and his loyal henchmen—the seven agents. The fruits of the farmers' hard labor each year were entirely handed over to the rulers, and the laborers lived a life of cattle and horses, without a place to sleep at night and without being able to eat their fill during the day.

After the suppression of the rebellion in April 1959, the brilliance of Chairman Mao illuminated the villages of Xialuo. A series of class struggle movements freed the suffering people here from the shackles of serfdom. The Party and Chairman Mao brought everyone a new life of freedom, happiness, and ease of mind. At a grand meeting celebrating the victory of emancipation, eighty-four-year-old Grandmother Aguo Zhuoma was carried to the meeting on someone's back. The masses looked at the old woman in her new clothes with respect, cheering and applauding for her happiness. The elderly Aguo Zhuoma, grinning with her toothless mouth, whether moved by happiness or stirred by the contrast between the old and new, shed large tears. Eighty-four long years, enduring the torment of a living hell, without children, without support. So many sleepless nights, swallowing bitterness. In her later years, she dared not imagine how she would end up. Today, she has seen the light of day, received the support and respect of the people. This blessing in her old age is thanks to Chairman Mao, thanks to the Party.

The Tibetan New Year arrived. The winter's grand manure accumulation campaign and red flag competition were stirring the hearts of everyone. Enthusiasm brought an even more enthusiastic, lively, and joyous atmosphere to the festival. On the day before the New Year, as the sun was setting in the west, Dage, the director of the Farmers' Association, called a mass meeting, gathering the people who were transporting manure from the fields and roads. He said, "This year is our first year of emancipation. Everyone should celebrate this festival even more joyfully. In the past, we were always hungry all year round. Now we have finally looked forward to it. We are beginning to celebrate our own festival." After the meeting, a couple of strong young Langsheng began cleaning from the stove to the house, from inside the house to the chicken coop, sheepfold, and toilet, and did not finish until ten o'clock in the evening. The wife, Yuse, stored the dust she had swept up as if she were saving grain.

The youth song and dance troupe, Tibetan opera, and lion dance brought joy to the people of every village. As the sun set in the west, the fun was not yet over. On the wide flat area, the youth team's singing was loud and melodious, attracting a large crowd of spectators. One by one, new songs praising Chairman Mao and the Communist Party excited people so much that they forgot to sleep. A half-moon revealed a smiling face from the clouds, as if congratulating everyone on their happiness, and as if celebrating the festival with everyone. Suddenly, the "Eight-Character Constitution" duet and dance made the crowd cheer and jump for joy. Director Dage said with a smile, "1960 has begun. The Eight-Character Constitution is a valuable method pointed out by the Party to increase agricultural production. Let's see who implements it well and see who harvests more grain in the autumn." The joyous festival ended in thunderous applause.

At dawn the next day, the tinkling of donkey bells mixed with shouts broke the silence of the fields. According to old habits, after the Tibetan New Year, the laboring people would begin preparing to start production. This year, everything has changed. People have become more agile, their actions are swift, the villages are active, and the year's production shows a strong fighting force in the spring plowing and major production. People's determination, enthusiasm, and joyful mood suppressed the severe winter weather.

How beautiful the Xiongqu River is in summer, the trees along the river are dressed in new clothes. The east wind blows the branches and the river sings a duet. Apples and peach trees are bearing dense young fruits, and groups of cattle and sheep are chewing on tender grass, chasing and playing on the river滩 plains. The green seedlings on the shore are blown by the breeze like soft cushions, and seeing the green rice seedlings growing stronger day by day brings people joy, victorious smiles, and greater energy. The scene of a bumper harvest encourages the emancipated people by the river, and in the minds of the masses, they firmly believe that with the leadership of Chairman Mao, they will be able to overcome difficulties. In early August, a continuous rainy day did not stop people's labor. The fields were filled with laughter and singing, which seemed even more clear and loud. Mutual aid team leader Ji Mei Caidan called out to the township Farmers' Association director from afar. When Dage ran to the edge of the field, the fifty-year-old team leader opened his mouth and said, "Now our team can reach a thousand catties per Ke. Do you think our will can compete with Mount Everest? Can we say we have won this year?" Comrade Dage said, "The crops are good, but they haven't been put in the granary yet." The team members laughed. Dage stopped and Gongga, a member of the Communist Youth League, continued, "The director is right. If the grain is not in the home, we can't draw a conclusion about competing with Mount Everest. We are still on the last leg of the race against time." Dage didn't say anything else and went towards a large red flag. The laughter of the masses made him stop, and he turned back to add, "Gongga is right, I hope everyone will work hard to attend the labor model meeting at the higher level."

Dage came to the Red Flag Sanmenzhu team. Everyone's laughter really made it difficult for him to interrupt, so in order to hear the whole story, he joined the labor. The vice director's wife, Dawa Cuomu, was saying, "You people with culture say that this year's crops are good because the weather is good. How many new things has the Party led us to do this year? Selecting seeds and mixing them with yellow mud and water results in more uniform grain emergence. In the past, we scattered seeds everywhere, but this year we used strip planting. Pressing fertilizer, and there are hundreds of stones of fertilizer all at once. Let's just talk about weeding, how many times did we weed this year, did we weed in previous years? I'm not afraid of being laughed at." Luo Sangqunpei, who was being criticized, retorted before others finished speaking, "I'm not superstitious, I said that this year is just good weather. I used to be a lama, and I also said that we should respect the gods. Now it seems that we still have to rely on our living Bodhisattva, Director, are you right?" Dage did not answer him directly, nor did he say anything else. He was thinking about Ji Mei Caidan's words and the debate in this team. The director finally said happily, "You are arguing very well, you must continue to argue, why do we get such pleasing crops this year. Everyone must express their opinions at the general meeting." When leaving, this director who had been a Langsheng for half his life and grazed sheep for more than twenty years could not control his inner joy and sang a little tune.

At the mass meeting, a female mutual aid team leader called out to Old Mother Ouzhu Yangzhong, "You have won the district's 'Six Goods' honorary plaque and material rewards, tell us how you, an old woman who is two years short of seventy, worked more than nine hundred work points?" Then, such voices were heard in the venue: "Yes! Old model, tell us, let's learn from you." Ouzhu Yangzhong stood up awkwardly: "What can I, an old and useless person, say! I have lived a life without food or clothing for most of my life. Chairman Mao brought a new society, and I have everything. Besides, production is my own. How can I not produce well and live up to Chairman Mao and the two Ke of land I got from emancipation! The Party often gives us new methods, and when I think of Chairman Mao, I can't use up my energy." Blind Old Mother Baima Yinzeng stood up, feeling her way, and said: "I have been a Langsheng for the Xialuo Zongben since I was a child. I got eye disease from cattle-like labor, and I still had to work desperately. I was chased out of the Zongben's gate to beg for food when my eyes went blind. Now that I am over fifty years old, I have been liberated and live a good life thanks to Chairman Mao. This year, district cadres and secretaries have helped me with labor, and my crops are even better than yours." The director stood up and said: "Let's talk more about why the crops are so good this year. Find the experience of this year's bumper harvest and prepare for a greater leap forward next year." Everyone was talking non-stop, and old team leader Ji Mei Caidan said seriously: "The land was plowed early and well, and the sowing was more than forty days earlier than in previous years." The branch secretary asked everyone for their opinions on the township branch. People replied happily: "The cadres are good. This year, our emancipated Ping area is both a production front, a battlefield for reasoning and struggle, and a place for meetings and discussions. The struggle has been won, and production has greatly increased, all thanks to the good leadership of the Party!"

The mountain tops are capped with shining snow, and the autumn wind brings coolness. The tense major harvesting has begun. Many white tents have been set up in the fields, which are people's campsites. The logistics team of each combat team is busy boiling water and delivering tea. The people plowing the fields whistle all over the Ping area, and the harvesting team, although so tense, does not forget their beloved mountain songs. The donkey teams with large bells come and go, and the sound of the bells urges people to fight.

Old team leader Ji Mei Caidan divided his team's labor force into six teams: harvesting, plowing, transporting, threshing, seed selection, and logistics. Old men and women happily take on the task of boiling water, watching children, and doing odd jobs. Elementary school students are not left behind either, taking on the task of watching birds and picking up wheat ears.

Female Communist Party member Gu Sang Yuzhen ran desperately from the threshing floor to the Ping area, shouting at the director with all her might. She was really out of breath. When she saw the director, she said loudly, panting, "I led one person from each team to finish threshing for Blind Mother Baima Yinzeng. Her one point two five acres yielded a net of fifty-one Ke!" The crowd on the scene made the same surprised sounds and talked about it. At this time, female Communist Youth League member Gongga also ran over in a hurry and called the team leader, shouting: "That Ke of land at your door, I measured it as forty-eight Ke, go back and weigh how many catties it is." The team members said: We have never heard of such a thing since the beginning of time. This is all thanks to Chairman Mao. The branch secretary, the old team leader, and the two young women hurried back. They first arrived at Ji Mei Caidan's threshing floor. The result of the weighing was one thousand three hundred and forty-four catties. Dage said happily: "Old team leader, you can participate in the labor model meeting, if everyone is like this, we will also become an advanced township!" He immediately passed the good news to the people on the Ping area.

Arriving at Baima Yinzeng's home, the blind old mother warmly greeted Dage to sit down, and said intermittently: "You know my past suffering, where have I ever seen an inch of my own soil or had a handful of my own grain? But this year I..." Dage took over and said: "This year you have begun to live a happy life. Under the correct leadership of the Party, your happy days will get better and better." The old mother's mood, which was fragrant in her mouth and sweet in her heart, made her laugh non-stop, and she said excitedly: "The Party's benefits cannot be said enough, and Chairman Mao's kindness is deeper than the sea!"

    农奴翻身第一年
    中共西藏拉加里县下洛区委书记　翟清太
    从丛山峻岭间流下一条宽阔而弯曲的江，这条雄赳江长达百余里，直通雅鲁藏布江，在拉加里地区河左岸并排耸立着三座高楼大厦，这就是拉加里劳动人民祖祖辈辈被奴役的直接统治者——山南王、下江、下洛三大贵族之家。河滩内林木葱翠，其中山南王公园用劳动人民的血汗修起华丽的王室和从室。在下洛地方沿江而下有十一个村庄，居住着一百二十六户人家，祖辈就在这一千五百克地的大坪上从事劳动，但世世代代受着下洛宗本和他的忠实爪牙——七户代理人的惨无人道的统治、压迫、剥削。农民每年辛勤劳动的果实全部交到统治者手里，劳动的人们只是过着夜无卧宿、日不得饱的牛马生活。
    1959年4月平息叛乱后，毛主席的光辉照耀了下洛的村庄。一系列的阶级斗争运动，使这里的受苦人打掉了农奴制度的枷锁。党和毛主席带给大家自由幸福、心情舒畅的新生活。在一次庆祝翻身胜利的大会上，八十四岁的孤老妈妈阿角卓玛让人背来参加了大会。群众以尊敬的眼光望着全身新装的老人，为她的幸福欢呼鼓掌。而年老的阿角卓玛，咧着没有牙的嘴大笑着，也不知是幸福的激动，还是新旧对比冲动了她，泪花大颗大颗地掉下来。八十四年漫长的岁月，受尽了人间地狱的罪恶折磨，无儿无女，无依无靠。多少个不能安眠的夜，让苦水往肚里咽，晚年想也不敢想自己是怎么个下场。今天，见了青天，得到人民的赡养和尊敬，晚年的福，是毛主席的福，是党的福。
    藏历年到了。冬季大积肥运动红旗赛正激动着每个人的心，干劲为节日带来了更加热烈、生动、愉快的场面。年前一天太阳落西山的时分，农会主任达格从地里和路上召回运肥的人们开了个群众会。他说：“今年是我们翻身的第一年，大家更要愉快地过好这个节日。过去一年到头总是饿着肚子干到头，现在总算盼到了，我们开始过自己的节日了。”散会后一对壮年朗生夫妻开始从灶到房，由屋内到鸡窝、羊圈、厕所，一直打扫到晚上十点才算整顿就绪。妻子玉色将打扫的尘土像保存粮食一样地存放起来。
    青年歌舞队、藏戏、狮子队给每个村庄的人们逗的欢乐不已。日落西山，余兴未尽，在宽阔的大坪上青年队的歌声嘹亮悦耳，吸引了大群的观众。一个个歌颂毛主席歌颂共产党的新歌使人兴奋忘寝。半轮晚月，从云层中露出了笑脸，像祝贺大家的快乐，也像和大家同庆节日。突然，“八字宪法”的对歌舞使人群欢腾起来了，拍手称绝。主任达格笑着说：“1960年开始了。八字宪法是党指引我们搞农业增产的宝贵办法，看谁执行的好，秋后多打粮食见高低。”欢乐的节日在震天的掌声中结束。
  第二天拂晓，毛驴的响铃当夹着?喝声划破了寂静的田野，按照老习惯，藏历年后，劳动的人们才开始准备动土生产，今年一切都变了。人变灵活了，行动迅速了，村庄活跃了，一年的生产在春耕大生产中显示了强大的战斗力。人们的决心、干劲和欢乐的心情压下冬季严寒的天气。
    夏天的雄赳江是多么的美丽，沿江两旁的树木披上了新装。东风吹得树枝条和江水对唱着小调，苹果、桃树结上了稠密的嫩果，一群一群牛羊嚼着嫩草，追逐嬉戏在河滩平原上。岸上青苗被微风吹拂得像柔软的茵褥，眼看绿油油的秧苗一天天矫健地生长着，给人们带来了喜悦的心情、胜利的微笑和更大的劲头。丰收的景象鼓励着江边翻身的人们，在群众的脑海里深信有毛主席的领导定能战胜困难。8月初一个连阴雨天，它并没有阻挡住人们的劳动，地里一片说笑声、歌唱声显得更加清脆和响亮。互助组长纪美才旦很远就招呼着乡农会主任，等达格跑到地边，五十多岁的老组长张着嘴说起来：“现在我们组能达到克产千斤，你说咱们的意志和珠穆朗玛峰比高低，今年算不算我们胜利了？”达格同志说：“庄稼是不错，可还没有入仓。”组员笑起来了。达格停了下来，共青团员公卡接上说：“主任说的对，粮不进家，我们与珠穆朗玛峰比高低，还不敢得出结论，和时间赛跑也还差最后一段路。”达格再没说什么，朝一面大红旗的方向前去。群众的笑声使他站住脚，回头补充说：“公卡说的好，希望大家努力争取出席上级的劳模会。”
    达格来到了红旗三门朱组，大家的笑声，真使他插不上嘴，为了听个水落石出，就参加了劳动。副主任的爱人达娃措母正在说：“你这有文化的人说出今年庄稼好是天好，今年党领导我们作了多少新事呀，选种用黄泥拌水，粮食出的多齐；过去是遍地撒种，今年用条播；压肥、肥料一下就有几百石；就说锄草吧，今年锄几道，往年锄了吗？也不怕别人笑。”被批评的罗桑群佩不服气地不等别人说完就反驳起来了：“我不是迷信，我说，今年就是风调雨顺，过去我也当过喇嘛，也说要敬神，现在看来还是要靠我们这活菩萨，主任你说对吗？”达格没有直接回答他，也没说别的。他在思考纪美才旦的话和这个组的争论。主任最后高兴地说：“你们争的很好，还要继续争，今年为什么得到这样使人高兴的庄稼。开大会时大家都要发表自己的意见。”离开时，这个当了半辈子的朗生，放了二十多年羊的主任，控制不了内心的高兴也唱起了小调。
    群众会上一个女互助组长喊着欧朱杨中老妈妈说“你得了区六好光荣牌和物质奖励，说说你这孤老妈差二岁已七十岁的人，怎样劳动九百多个工分的？”接着会场上又发出这样的声音：“是呀！老模范说说，我们好好学习。”欧朱杨中尴尬地站起来：“叫我老了没有用的人说啥呢！过了一大辈子过的是无吃无穿的生活，毛主席带来新社会，我啥都有。再说生产是自己的，不好好生产怎么对得起毛主席和翻身得来那二克地呢！有党常常交给我们新办法，想起毛主席，我的劲就使不完。”瞎子孤老妈妈白马银曾摸着站起来说：“我从小给下洛宗本当朗生，牛马般的劳动得了眼病，还要拼死拼活地干活，眼睛弄瞎了，被撵出宗本的大门讨饭吃。现在我五十多岁的人得到解放，靠毛主席过好日子。今年区里干部、书记都帮我劳动，庄稼比你们的还好。”主任站起来说：“大家再说说今年为什么长这样好的庄稼。把今年丰收的经验找到，为明年更大的跃进作好准备。”大家你一句我一句说个不停，老组长纪美才旦认真地说：“地犁的早、好，下种比往年硬早四十多天。”支部书记征求大家对乡支部的意见。人们愉快地回答：“干部是好样的，今年咱们翻身的大坪上，又是生产阵地，又是说理斗争的战场，也是开会讨论的地方。斗争获得胜利，生产大大丰收，全是党的好领导！”
    山头戴上了放光的雪帽，秋天的风吹来了凉意，人们紧张的大收刈开始了。地头搭起不少的白帐棚，这就是人们的宿营地。每个战斗小组的后勤队忙着烧水、送茶，犁地的人们打着口哨吹遍了大坪，收刈队虽是那么紧张也忘不了心爱的山歌。带着大铃的毛驴队来来去去，铃当声催促着人们的战斗。
    老组长纪美才旦把自己组的劳力分成收刈、犁地、运输、打场、选种和后勤六个队。老头老婆愉快地担负烧水、看小孩、作零活的任务。小学生也同样不落后，担负着看鸟、拣麦穗工作。
    女共产党员古桑玉珍从打麦场拼命跑到大坪上，用劲地喊着主任，她实在喘不过气，见到主任就上气不接下气大声地说：“我领着每个组一个人给瞎子妈妈白马银曾打完场了。她那一点二五亩净收五十一克呀！”在场群众发出了同样的惊奇声，纷纷议论。这时，女共青团员公卡也匆匆地跑来叫组长，嚷着说：“你门口那一克地，我量是四十八克，是多少斤你回去称称。”组员们说：开天辟地还没听到这样的事，这全是毛主席的功劳。支部书记、老组长、二个女青年赶忙往回转，先到了纪美才旦打麦场，称的结果是一千三百四十四斤。达格高兴地说：“老组长你可以参加劳模会，要都是这样咱们也成了先进乡了！”他把喜信立即传给大坪上的人们。
    来到白马银曾家，瞎老妈妈亲热地招呼达格坐，断续地说：“我过去的苦你知道，哪里见过自己的一寸土和有过自己的一把粮？可今年我……”达格接过来说：“今年你开始过起幸福生活来了。在党的正确领导下你的快乐日子是会越过越好的。”老妈妈香在嘴，甜在心里的心情使她笑声不已，激动地说：“党的好处说不完，毛主席的恩情比海深！”
