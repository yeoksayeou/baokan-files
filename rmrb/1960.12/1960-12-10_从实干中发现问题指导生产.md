    Discover Problems from Practical Work to Guide Production
    Gao Zizheng, Secretary of the General Party Branch of Yangguo Commune, Weinan, Shaanxi
    In the past, I often neglected investigation and research in leading production, and I did not have enough understanding of the actual situation of the production team. Therefore, sometimes the work I arranged was not practical enough. After going deeper, this situation changed quickly. For example, before the autumn planting began, I was stationed in the Tunzhang production team and saw that some commune members were not very motivated. Zhang Jishan, a young and strong commune member, only pushed manure twice in the morning before stopping work. What was the reason? After understanding, it turned out that he thought the work points for pushing manure were too low and the quota was too high. What is the actual situation? Only through practice can a correct conclusion be drawn. So, I personally pushed manure for a morning, and only pushed it nine times. According to their quota, I could only get 2.7 work points, which means I could only get a little more than 8 work points a day. Then, I investigated the work point standards for other labor. It was found that some old people could get 10 work points a day for cutting 200 catties of grass. In contrast, it was obvious that the labor quota and work point remuneration were unreasonable, which affected the enthusiasm of the commune members. After the problem was discovered, I discussed it with the team cadres and rationally adjusted the labor quota and work point remuneration. The commune members' enthusiasm for labor was immediately mobilized.
    The education of many facts has made me deeply realize that cadres going to the forefront of production must take the lead in doing practical work, conduct investigations and research in practical work, so as to discover problems, solve problems, and thus lead production well.

    从实干中发现问题指导生产
    陕西渭南阳郭公社员曲总支书记　高志正
    过去，我在领导生产中，往往不注意调查研究，对生产队实际情况掌握不够，因此有时布置工作不够切合实际。深入以后，这种情况就很快改变了。例如在秋播开始前，我到屯张生产队驻点，看到有些社员积极性不高，社员张积善年青力壮，但一晌只推了两回粪就收了工。是什么原因？经过了解，原来他嫌推粪工分少，定额高。实际情况到底如何，必须通过实践才能得出正确结论。于是，我就亲自推了一晌粪，结果只推了九回。按他们的定额一算，才能得工分二分七厘，就是说一天才能得八分多工。接着，我又调查了其他劳动的工分标准。发现一些老人，一天割二百斤草，就能得十分工。对比之下，显然是定额和工分报酬定得不合理，影响了社员劳动积极性。问题发现后，就和队干部商量，合理地调整了劳动定额和工分报酬。社员的劳动积极性马上调动了起来。
    通过许多事实的教育，使我深刻的体会到，干部深入生产第一线，必须带头实干，在实干中，进行调查研究，才能发现问题，解决问题，从而把生产领导好。（附图片）
