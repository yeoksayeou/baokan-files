To Act as a "Technical Advisor" for Large-Scale Agriculture
Jilin Academy of Agricultural Sciences Strengthens Commune Research Base Points

(Our dispatch) The Jilin Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences is strengthening its commune research base points to act as a "technical advisor" for large-scale agriculture and grain production. This year, in addition to conducting research on agricultural yield increase patterns and agricultural theory within the academy, the Jilin Academy of Agricultural Sciences has also established research base points for rice, wheat, soybeans, and coarse grains in people's communes in counties such as Yanji, Fuyu, and Yushu. The scientific research personnel at the base points, under the unified leadership of the local Party committees, combine with local production experts and experienced farmers to assist in the timely formulation of production technology measures, promote advanced production experience, and implement the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" in accordance with local conditions, playing the role of "technical advisor" in production. Researchers stationed at the rice base point in the Xinfeng Management Area of the Henan Commune in Yanji City, before the start of each production stage, first summarize the past production experience of the masses, combine it with existing scientific research results, and promptly propose yield-increasing technical measures. They also conduct in-depth field investigations and research to identify and solve problems in a timely manner. Over the past year, this base point has successively promoted advanced production technology measures such as seedling cultivation techniques, topdressing, mid-tillage, shallow irrigation, and the use of rice transplanters. This year, the Xinfeng Management Area has achieved increased production on 253 hectares of paddy fields due to the conscientious implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" and the full utilization of the power of the people's commune. The researchers at the base point also adopted a combination of point and area working methods, establishing some "sub-points" around the base point to promptly promote various advanced technologies and experiences from the base point and guide all aspects of production. After the Fuyu Township Commune base point formulated wheat yield-increasing technical measures, the commune Party committee suggested that the county Party committee promote them throughout the county, which played a certain role in increasing wheat production throughout the county.

The researchers also summarize the yield-increasing experiences of the masses through the base points. For example, the researchers at the rice base point comprehensively summarized the advanced rice production experience of advanced agricultural producer Cui Zhusong, and discovered the scientific law of "two yellows and two blacks" in the color changes of rice plant stems, summarizing a set of rice yield-increasing experiences suitable for promotion in the Yanbian area. At the same time, they researched the method of using oiled paper for heat-preserving seedling cultivation, as well as how to select oiled paper, brush oil, and improve the paper pressing operation, which increased the utilization rate of oiled paper and reduced the cost of seedling cultivation from 60-70 yuan per mu to 30-40 yuan. The researchers at the soybean research base point, in Yushu Town and Longdian Management Area of Yushu County, researched the experience of high soybean yields and summarized a set of yield-increasing technical measures focusing on density and fertilizer, providing a relatively practical method for the whole province to increase soybean production. In terms of coarse grains, some yield-increasing experiences have also been summarized. These experiences all come from production practice, are simple and convenient to implement, are suitable for local production conditions, and are easy to promote, and are praised by the masses.

Each research base point has also carried out mass scientific research activities, popularized scientific and technical knowledge, and cultivated technical talents. For example, the coarse grains base point in the Liu Dahao Management Area of the Nanwaizi Commune in Huaide County, combined with production during the spring plowing and sowing season, ran amateur training courses to teach local youth and production experts technologies such as corn hybridization, and conducted comparative tests of various densities and fertilizers. Through carrying out mass scientific research activities, not only have local scientific and technical talents been cultivated, but also professional researchers have been trained and their ideological awareness has been improved.

    为大办农业当好“技术参谋”
    吉林农业科学院加强公社研究基点
    本报讯　吉林省农业科学院加强公社研究基点，为大办农业、大办粮食当好“技术参谋”。今年以来，吉林农业科学院除了在院内进行农业增产规律和农业理论的研究外，还在延吉、扶余、榆树等县人民公社，建立了水稻、小麦、大豆、杂粮的研究基点。基点的科学研究人员在当地党委的统一领导下，同当地的生产能手、老农相结合，根据不同生产时期和生产情况，协助当地及时制订生产技术措施，推广先进生产经验，因地制宜地贯彻农业“八字宪法”，在生产中发挥了“技术参谋”的作用。驻延吉市河南公社新丰管理区水稻基点的研究人员，在每一个生产阶段开始之前，都先总结群众过去的生产经验，结合已有的科学研究成果，及时提出增产技术措施，并且深入田间调查研究，发现问题，及时解决。一年来，这个基点先后推广了育苗技术，追肥、中耕、浅灌、插秧机使用等先进生产技术措施。新丰管理区今年由于认真贯彻执行了农业
  “八字宪法”，充分发挥了人民公社的威力，有二百五十三公顷稻田获得了增产。基点的研究人员，还采取点面结合的工作方法，在基点周围又设立了一些“副点”，使基点的各种先进技术经验，及时推广出去，指导全面。扶余镇公社基点制订出小麦增产技术措施以后，由公社党委建议县委在全县推广，对全县小麦增产起了一定的作用。
    研究人员还通过基点总结群众的增产经验。如水稻基点的研究人员，全面总结了先进农业生产者崔竹松的水稻先进生产经验，摸出了水稻植棵颜色变化“两黄两黑”的科学规律，总结出一套适合延边地区推广的水稻增产经验。同时研究用油纸保温的育苗方法，以及如何选择油纸、刷油，改进压纸操作，提高了油纸利用率，使每亩育苗费由六、七十元降低到三、四十元。大豆研究基点的研究人员，在榆树县榆树镇与隆店管理区研究大豆丰产的经验，总结出一套以密、肥为重点的增产技术措施，为全省提高大豆产量，提供了比较切实可行的办法。在杂粮方面，也总结了一些增产经验。这些经验都是从生产实践中来，措施简便，适合于当地生产情况，易于推广，受到群众赞扬。
    各研究基点还开展了群众性的科学研究活动，普及科学技术知识，培养技术人材。如驻怀德县南崴子公社刘大壕管理区的杂粮基点，在春耕播种时，结合生产开办了业余训练班，向当地的青年、生产能手传授了玉米杂交等技术，并且做了各种密度、肥料的对比试验。通过开展群众性科学研究活动，不仅培养了当地科学技术人材，而且锻炼了专业研究人员，提高了思想觉悟。
