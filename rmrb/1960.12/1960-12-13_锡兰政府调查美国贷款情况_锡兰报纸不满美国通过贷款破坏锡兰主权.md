Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, December 8th: According to reports in the local newspapers, the Ceylonese Ministry of Finance has launched an investigation into the US Embassy's distribution of certain "loans" to "private investors."

By September 30th of this year, the United States had sold Ceylon surplus wheat and flour worth 111.86 million rupees. The Ceylonese government repaid for these surplus agricultural products in rupees. A portion of this sum was given to the Ceylonese government as "loans and grants," while the remainder was provided as loans to "private investors" by US loan officers. Currently, the ultimate use of this money has aroused widespread attention from the Ceylonese public and government.

According to a report in the "Daily News" on the 7th, the Ministry of Finance wrote to the US authorities here requesting a response as to why a portion of this sum was withdrawn from the banks and how it was allocated.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the "Ceylon Observer" published an editorial on the 3rd, stating that the US "Foreign Aid Mission" in Ceylon's lending to Ceylonese private individuals without the consent of the Ceylonese government is a threat to national sovereignty.

The editorial said: "Any foreign authority having the right to lend to Ceylonese private individuals without first obtaining the consent of the (Ceylonese) government is the most unsatisfactory arrangement. This practice encourages business figures who are subordinate to foreign agencies in the hope of obtaining financial assistance to grow like cancer, thereby threatening the integrity of the nation."

    锡兰政府调查美国贷款情况
    锡兰报纸不满美国通过贷款破坏锡兰主权
    据新华社科伦坡8日电　据这里的报纸报道，锡兰财政部已经就美国大使馆把一些“贷款”发放给“私人投资者”一事进行了调查。
    到今年9月30日为止，美国把价值一亿一千一百八十六万卢比的剩余小麦和面粉卖给锡兰。锡兰政府是用卢比偿付这些剩余农产品的。这笔款项中，一部分给予锡兰政府作为“贷款和赠款”，余下的部分则由美国负责发放贷款的官员向“私人投资者”提供贷款。目前，这笔钱的用途究竟如何，已引起了锡兰公众和政府的普遍注意。
    据《每日新闻》7日报道，财政部曾经写信要求这里的美国当局答复，为什么从银行中提取这笔款项的一部分以及如何分配它们。
    据新华社讯《锡兰观察家报》3日发表社论说：美国驻锡兰“援外使团”不经锡兰政府的同意就贷款给锡兰私人，这是对国家主权的威胁。
    社论说：“任何外国当局不在事先得到（锡兰）政府的同意而有权贷款给锡兰私人，这是最不能令人满意的安排。这种做法鼓励那些为了希望得到财政援助而从属于外国的代理机构的企业界人士像癌症那样成长起来，因而威胁到国家的完整”。
