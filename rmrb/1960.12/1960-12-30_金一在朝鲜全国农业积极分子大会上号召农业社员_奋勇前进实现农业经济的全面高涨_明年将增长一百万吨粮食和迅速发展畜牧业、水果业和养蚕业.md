Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 28th: The National Conference of Agricultural Activists of Korea grandly opened today at the Pyongyang Grand Theater. More than 2,400 people attended the conference, including agricultural activists, agricultural cooperative cadres, workers from agricultural machinery stations, and agricultural science and technology personnel.

Kim Il-sung, Premier; Choi Yong-kun, Chairman; and Kim Il, Hong Myung-hee, Park Jung-ae, Park Kum-chul, Kim Chang-man, Jung Il-ryong, Nam Il, Kim Kwang-hyup, Lee Hyo-soon, Lim Hae, Han Sang-du, Jung Joon-taek, and other Korean party and government leaders attended the conference.

Kim Il, First Deputy Premier of the Cabinet, delivered a report at the morning session today. In his report, he summarized the brilliant achievements made on the agricultural front in northern Korea this year and put forward new tasks for 1961.

Kim Il said that due to the historic victory of agricultural collectivization and the active support of heavy industry, the agricultural economy has undergone tremendous changes. Korea has basically completed water conservancy and electrification in rural areas. The water-benefited area of paddy fields has increased from 30% before liberation to 98%, and irrigation systems have also been widely established in dry fields. Every ri (equivalent to a township) in the countryside has electricity. The total agricultural output value this year has increased to 1.6 times that before the war, and the rural areas now have a solid foundation to ensure high yields every year.

Kim Il said that the agricultural economy correctly implemented the policy of continuing to expand and improve land and increase land utilization. In the past year, 103,000 chongbo of cultivated land have been newly expanded, and a campaign to utilize all idle land has been launched, resulting in an increase in the national land utilization rate from 150% last year to 174%. The total sown area has increased by 360,000 chongbo, and the sown area of food crops has increased by 653,000 chongbo.

Due to the state's measures to supplement the shortage of rural labor, many demobilized soldiers and junior and senior high school graduates have been assigned to agricultural cooperatives. This year, more than 87,000 new members have been added, and more than 13,000 management personnel have been reduced. The labor force for non-productive expenditures has been reduced from 11% last year to 4%, concentrating 80%-90% of the labor force on agricultural labor. Due to the very high enthusiasm of the members, their attendance rate has increased from 86% to 93%. The average number of workdays per person per year has increased from 301 days to 345 days, meaning that each member has worked an average of one month more than last year. At the same time, due to the merging of work teams and the rational organization of production, the labor force has been effectively utilized.

Kim Il said that this year, unprecedentedly high yields have been achieved in grain production. Compared with last year, the yield of rice per chongbo has increased by 11%, corn by 17%, and soybeans by 15%. The total grain output has reached 3,803,000 tons, which is equivalent to 1.4 times that of 1949 before the war and more than twice that of 1946. As a result, the distributed portion of agricultural cooperative members has grown rapidly this year. The national average per household received 2,100 kilograms of grain, 540 kilograms of potatoes, and 300 won (Korean currency) in cash.

Kim Il said that although we have made great achievements in the agricultural economy this year, we are still faced with the task that must be completed during the decisive period of the country's socialist construction—the Seven-Year Plan—continuing to implement the Party's policy of comprehensively developing an agricultural economy with grain as the mainstay.

When talking about agriculture's tasks in 1961, Kim Il said that the recent enlarged Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Party in December put forward the tasks of increasing grain production by one million tons in 1961—the first year of the Seven-Year Plan—and rapidly developing animal husbandry, the fruit industry, sericulture, and other industries. The entire party and all the people must concentrate their efforts to actively participate in the struggle to increase grain production.

Kim Il said that heavy industry will supply agriculture with 2,900 large and medium-sized tractors, 4,600 small tractors, 500 trucks, and a large number of towed agricultural machinery next year. The supply of chemical fertilizers next year will double this year's amount, reaching 600,000 tons, so that each chongbo of paddy and dry land can be fertilized with more than 400 kg and 300 kg of chemical fertilizers, respectively. At the same time, mechanization must be fully implemented in two or three years, from the plains to the mountains. Agricultural cooperatives and state agricultural and livestock farms must decisively increase self-supplied fertilizers, so that the national average production of rice can reach more than 4.5 tons per chongbo and corn can reach more than 3 tons per chongbo next year.

Kim Il emphasized that we are today directly confronting the ringleader of the world's reactionary forces and the Korean people's sworn enemy—the U.S. imperialists. The more victorious our socialist construction advances, the more frantically the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys who are occupying South Korea will carry out sabotage. Party organizations must ensure that agricultural cooperative members always heighten their vigilance, strengthen the socialist rural base like iron, and not give the enemy any gaps.

Finally, Kim Il called on agricultural cooperative members across the country to bravely overcome all difficulties, launch a great technological revolution and a great cultural revolution, continue to ride the momentum of the Chollima (Thousand-Li Horse), and forge ahead courageously for the new all-round upsurge of increasing grain production by one million tons and agricultural economy next year!

    金一在朝鲜全国农业积极分子大会上号召农业社员
    奋勇前进实现农业经济的全面高涨
    明年将增长一百万吨粮食和迅速发展畜牧业、水果业和养蚕业
    新华社平壤28日电　朝鲜全国农业积极分子大会今天在平壤大剧场隆重开幕。参加大会的有农业积极分子、农业社干部、农业机械所的工人、农业科学技术人员等二千四百多人。
    金日成首相、崔庸健委员长，金一、洪命熹、朴正爱、朴金喆、金昌满、郑一龙、南日、金光侠、李孝淳、林海、韩相斗、郑准泽等朝鲜党政领导人出席了大会。
    朝鲜内阁第一副首相金一在今天上午会议上作了报告。他在报告中总结了朝鲜北部今年在农业战线上所取得的辉煌成就，同时提出了1961年度的新任务。
    金一说，由于农业合作化的历史性胜利和重工业的积极支援，农业经济起了巨大的变化。朝鲜已经基本上完成了农村的水利化和电气化，水田的水利受益面积由解放前的30％增加到了98％，旱田也广泛地建立了灌溉体系，农村的每个里（相当于乡）都有了电。今年的农业总产值增长到战前的一点六倍，现在农村已经有了保证年年高产的牢固基础。
    金一说，农业经济正确地执行了继续扩大和改良土地并提高土地利用率的方针。今年一年间新扩大了十万三千町步耕地面积，展开了利用一切空闲地的运动，结果使全国土地利用率由去年的150％提高到了174％，总播种面积增加了三十六万町步，粮食作物播种面积增加六十五万三千町步。
    由于国家采取了补充农村劳动力不足的措施，把许多复员军人和初中、高中毕业生分配到了农业社，在这一年新增加八万七千多名社员，减少一万三千多名管理人员，使非生产支出的劳动力由去年11％减少到了4％，使80％—90％的劳动力集中到了农事劳动。由于社员劳动热情非常高涨，他们的出工率由86％提高到了93％，全年每个人的劳动日平均由三百零一天提高到了三百四十五天，即平均每个社员比去年多劳动了一个月。同时，由于合并了作业班，合理地组织了生产，因而有效地利用了劳动力。
    金一说，今年在粮食生产上获得了史无前例的高产，同去年相比，每町步水稻增产了11％，玉米——17％，大豆——15％，粮食总产量达到了三百八十万三千吨。这等于战前1949年的一点四倍，等于1946年的二倍以上。因而，今年农业社社员的分配部分有了迅速增长，全国平均每个农户分到二千一百公斤粮食、五百四十公斤薯类和三百元（朝币）现款。
    金一说，今年我们在农业经济方面虽然取得了巨大的成就，但是我们面前还摆着要在国家的社会主义建设的决定性时期——七年计划期间必须完成的任务——继续贯彻党的全面发展以粮食为主的农业经济的方针。
    金一在谈到农业在1961年的任务时说，最近举行的党中央委员会12月扩大全会提出了七年计划的第一年——1961年增产一百万吨粮食以及迅速发展畜牧业、水果业、养蚕业等任务。全党和全体人民必须集中火力积极参加增产粮食的斗争。
  金一说，重工业在明年将为农业供应二千九百台大中型拖拉机、四千六百台小型拖拉机、五百辆载重汽车以及大量拖带农业机械。明年化肥供应量将达到今年的二倍——六十万吨，使每町步水田和旱田能分别施四百公斤和三百公斤以上的化肥，同时必须在二、三年内从平原到山区全面实行机械化。农业社和国家农牧场必须决定性地增加自给肥料，使明年全国平均每町步生产四点五吨以上的水稻、三吨以上玉米。
    金一强调指出，我们今天直接同世界反动势力的元凶、朝鲜人民不共戴天的敌人——美帝国主义者对峙着。我们的社会主义建设越胜利前进，强占着南朝鲜的美帝国主义及其走狗就越会进行疯狂的破坏。党组织必须使农业社社员们始终提高警惕，钢铁般地加强社会主义的农村阵地，不给敌人丝毫的空隙。
    金一最后号召全国农业社员勇敢地克服一切困难，掀起技术大革新和文化大革命，继续以跨上千里马的气势，为明年增产一百万吨粮食和农业经济的新的全面高涨，奋勇前进！
