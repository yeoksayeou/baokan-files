    Let Workers Live Closer to the Factory

    The Shanghai Dafeng No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory cares about workers whose residences are too far from the factory. It mobilized and relied on the masses to actively adjust work locations and exchange housing for them.

    The factory's location is relatively remote, and more than 7% of the workers live more than fifteen *li* (approximately 7.5 kilometers) away from the factory, requiring them to spend more than two hours commuting to and from work. The factory's Party committee actively adopted measures to carry out adjustments of work locations and exchange of housing. They specifically lined up workers who lived far away and proposed a phased adjustment plan based on the principles of prioritizing urgent needs, starting with easier cases, benefiting production, and facilitating life. While adjusting housing and work, they created conditions for transferring workers from distant locations by carrying out "multi-skilled worker" activities and launching large-scale technological innovations. Workers in the front spinning workshop carried out large-scale technological innovations to achieve one person doing the work of several; on the other hand, they actively used the relationships of relatives, friends, and neighbors to find leads for distant workers to exchange jobs. Lin Lan, a young female worker and mother of three, was very inconvenienced by having to bring her children to and from work because no one at home could take care of them. They transferred her to her husband's workplace, the Shanghai Tool Factory.

    The factory's Party committee is very concerned about newly transferred workers. In addition to caring for them politically, ideologically, and in their daily lives, they also mobilized the masses to help them become familiar with production and quickly master the performance of the machines. For example, Chen Lingzhen, a loom operator transferred from the Yangpu Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory, was assigned a dedicated person by her group to help her master the performance of the machines after she entered the factory. At present, her output and quality have reached the level of veteran workers.

    让职工住得离厂近一些
    上海达丰第一棉纺织厂关心居住和工作地点过远的职工，发动和依靠群众积极为他们调整工作地点和调换住房。
    这家工厂的厂址比较偏僻，有7％以上的职工居住地点离厂在十五华里以上，这些职工上下班途中往返要两个多小时。这个厂的党委积极采取措施，开展调整工作地点和调换住房。他们把路远的职工具体排了队，根据先急后缓、先易后难、有利生产、便利生活的原则，提出分批调整的规划。在调整住房和工作同时，通过开展“多面手”活动和大搞技术革新，为调动路远职工的工作创造条件。前纺车间工人一方面大搞技术革新，实现一顶几；另方面主动通过亲戚朋友和邻居的关系，为路远职工做调换的线索。青年女工、三个孩子的妈妈林兰，由于家中无人照料，小孩上下班带来带去非常不便。他们就把她输送给她爱人的工作单位——上海工具厂去了。
    这个厂的党委对新调进的职工非常关心。对调进的人员，除了从政治思想和生活上关怀他们以外，还发动群众帮助他们熟悉生产，迅速掌握机器性能。如从杨浦棉纺织印染厂调来的布机挡车工陈玲珍，进厂后小组就指定专人帮助她掌握机器性能。目前她的产量、质量都已达到老工人水平。
