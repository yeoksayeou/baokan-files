The Zigon City Automobile Transportation Company in Sichuan Province has recently successfully tested a new method of "using the main vehicle as a trailer, so the vehicle does not travel alone," which saves fuel and increases production. They arrange several automobiles and trailers into a "mixed train." When driving on flat ground or downhill, only the front vehicle is driven. When going uphill, several vehicles are driven simultaneously, according to the situation, pulling from the front and pushing from the rear, to get the entire train up the hill.

This method generally reduces gasoline consumption by 45.6 percent, and greatly increases transport capacity. The average daily output of each vehicle has increased by 84 percent compared to the past.

    “混合列车”
    四川省自贡市汽车运输公司最近试验成功了“主车当挂车，车不单行”的既省油又高产的新办法。他们把几辆汽车和挂车编成一列“混合列车”，走平地和下坡路的时候，只开动最前面的一辆车；上坡时，根据情况几辆车同时开动，前拉后推，把整个列车送上坡去。
    这种办法，一般可以降低汽油消耗量百分之四十五点六，运量也大大增加，每辆汽车的平均日产量比过去增长百分之八十四。
