The communiqué said, "The two delegations decided to give their unreserved support to the heroic Algerian people in their struggle for their dignity, national independence, and against French imperialism and its allies."

The talks between the government delegations of the two countries, led respectively by President Sékou Touré and President Modibo Keita, were held at Siguiri in the Republic of Guinea on the 4th and 5th at the invitation of Sékou Touré. According to the communiqué, the two government delegations discussed the political situation in Africa and the world, as well as the relations between the two countries and the two parties during the talks.

The communiqué condemned the conspiracies plotted by neo-colonialism to maintain colonial rule in Africa.

The communiqué also stated, "The two delegations decided that both sides would support any initiative aimed at strengthening cooperation and solidarity among African countries on the basis of opposing imperialism and not participating politically in this or that hostile bloc."

The communiqué said, "The two delegations are pleased with the achievements made by the people of the two countries in their struggle to achieve national independence and effectively exercise sovereignty, noting the common goals of their respective parties and governments in the thorough decolonization and democratic development of their countries, and emphasized the need to strengthen cooperation in political, diplomatic, economic, cultural, and security matters to consolidate the independence of the two countries."

The joint communiqué also stated, "The two delegations decided to strengthen the existing friendly and cooperative relations with the Republic of Ghana." According to the communiqué, Guinea and Mali have decided to send resident ministers as diplomatic representatives of the two countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Accra, 5th December. Ghanaian President Nkrumah and Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie I signed a joint communiqué in Accra this morning.

Haile Selassie I arrived in Accra on the 1st for a visit. After signing the joint communiqué, he left Ghana by plane to visit Monrovia, the capital of Liberia.

The joint communiqué issued by both sides stated that the two heads of state exchanged views and held full discussions on pressing issues throughout the world, especially in Africa. They reached a consensus on issues including the following: "One, efforts must be made to establish a union of African states for the unity and security of Africa. Two, the events in the Congo show that independent African countries and other regions of Africa are insecure, and if independent African countries are to maintain their hard-won independence and strive for freedom for those African countries still struggling, they must remain highly vigilant. Three, in view of the events in Africa, it is currently necessary to take joint action. They agreed on the urgent need to consider the proposal to establish an African general command. Four, independent African countries should take immediate steps to establish an African monetary zone with a central bank."
