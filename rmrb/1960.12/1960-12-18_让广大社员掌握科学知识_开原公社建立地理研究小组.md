    Enabling Broad Masses of Commune Members to Master Scientific Knowledge
    Kaiyuan Commune Establishes Geographical Research Groups
    Xinhua News Agency, Changchun – The 97 production teams of Kaiyuan People's Commune in Shulan County, Jilin Province, universally established geographical research groups in July of this year, enabling the broad masses of commune members to master geographical scientific knowledge, serving the purpose of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production.
    The soil in this commune includes loess ridges, sandy soil, and black soil, thus requiring different types and quantities of fertilizer. This year, after the summer hoeing season, the geographical research groups consulted with experienced farmers to conduct a survey of the types and distribution of soil throughout the commune. Based on the nature of the soil, they proposed opinions on the types and quantities of fertilizer needed for each plot of land. These were submitted to each production team, preparing them for rational fertilization. The geographical research groups also summarized the experience of Dacheng Brigade in improving soil last year, making detailed comparisons between crops grown in improved and unimproved soil. They repeatedly explained the scientific rationale that soil improvement can lead to greater increases in production to the commune members, greatly enhancing their confidence and motivation in improving the soil.

    让广大社员掌握科学知识
    开原公社建立地理研究小组
    据新华社长春电　吉林省舒兰县开原人民公社九十七个生产队在今年7月普遍建立了地理研究小组，使广大社员掌握地理科学知识，为大办农业、大办粮食服务。
    这个公社的土质，有黄土岗地、黄沙土地、黑土地等，因此需要的肥料种类和数量也不同。地理研究小组就请老农当参谋，在今年夏锄后，对全社的土壤类型和分布情况进行了调查，并且根据土壤的性质，提出了各地块所需肥料的种类和数量的意见，提交各生产队，为各队合理施肥做好准备。地理研究小组还总结了大成大队去年改良土壤的经验，把经过改良和未经过改良的土壤所生长的庄稼进行细致比较，向社员反复地讲解改良土壤能更多增产的科学道理，大大增强了社员们改良土壤的信心和干劲。
