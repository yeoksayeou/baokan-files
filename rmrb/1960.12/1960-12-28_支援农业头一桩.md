The city and countryside are in an uproar,
Ten miles of spring breeze carries laughter,
The whip is crisp, the horses' hooves are busy,
Everyone on the cart is dressed as a worker.
Where are they going? To the commune.
What are they doing? To handle grain!
The carts are loaded with fertilizer,
The first thing to support agriculture.

    支援农业头一桩
    湖南邵阳红石公社　张七葑城里城外乱嚷嚷，十里春风笑声扬，鞭儿脆，马蹄忙，车上个个工人装。哪里去？上公社。做什么？去办粮！车车运的是化肥，支援农业头一桩。
