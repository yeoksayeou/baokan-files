Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th (TASS): Statement of the Soviet Government

The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a memorandum on "Peaceful Reunification of Korea" on November 11 this year. The eighth session of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, held from November 19 to 22 this year, discussed the issue of the earliest possible peaceful reunification of the country.

The memorandum of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the resolution of the eighth session of the Supreme People's Assembly put forward a broad program of action to achieve the goal desired by the Korean people - restoring the reunification of Korea on a peaceful and democratic basis. The proposal put forward in these documents regarding the establishment of a North-South Korean federation opens up realistic prospects for realizing this national task of the Korean people.

The Soviet Government welcomes the new initiative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which proves the consistent and firm efforts made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to strive for the restoration of Korean reunification.

As everyone knows, the Soviet Union has consistently and resolutely committed itself to creating favorable conditions for eliminating the division of Korea. The Soviet government sincerely sympathizes with the natural and reasonable desire of the Korean people to restore national unity. Life urgently demands that this issue be resolved in a way that benefits the Korean people and strengthens peace and security in the Far East. However, the efforts made by the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries in this regard have been stubbornly resisted by the United States and its allies in the aggressive bloc.

The U.S. occupation of southern Korea is the main obstacle to Korean reunification. For many years, the Korean people have resolutely demanded the withdrawal of U.S. troops. Although the Chinese People's Volunteers withdrew from Korea as early as two years ago, and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has repeatedly advocated consolidating peace in Korea and unilaterally reducing its armed forces, the U.S. government stubbornly refuses to withdraw its troops.

The United States refuses to withdraw its troops from Korea, is unwilling to promote a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, the U.S. warmongers are constantly clamoring to further strengthen its military bases in South Korea, and are violating the armistice agreement by transporting weapons of mass destruction there. All of this is a link in the aggressive foreign policy of the U.S. government. It attempts to solve the Korean issue by harming the interests of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and extending the colonial system to the entire Korean Peninsula. But now, even the most stubborn politicians in Western countries clearly realize that attempting to achieve this goal by force is an illusion.

If one proceeds from a sober assessment of the situation, one cannot fail to consider that two countries with essentially different political and economic systems have been formed on the Korean Peninsula.

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has become an industrial-agricultural socialist country. The industrial production of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has increased 6.7 times compared with 1944. The country has established a heavy industry base, built modern large enterprises of iron and non-ferrous metals, and established machine manufacturing, powerful power stations and light industrial enterprises. Cooperativized agriculture now provides twice as much grain as before the war. The material living standards of the residents of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are constantly improving.

A different situation has formed in South Korea. With the help of U.S. bayonets, a police terror and starvation regime has been established there. The level of industrial and agricultural production in South Korea is far lower than it was during the Japanese rule. There are often large numbers of unemployed people, and farmers are fleeing famine. The people have lost their basic rights and freedoms. The people have finally reached the point of unbearable endurance, so this spring, the foreign lackey and bloody ruler Syngman Rhee was forced to flee Korea. The uprising of the South Korean people convincingly shows that the residents of South Korea are unwilling to tolerate the reactionary rule imposed on them by others. The colonialist policy of the United States has suffered a shameful bankruptcy.

Under conditions where two countries with different social systems exist, the reunification of the country cannot be restored by forcing one country to accept the will of the other, especially by attempting to forcibly incorporate one part of the country into the other.

The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, deeply concerned about the future destiny of the nation, is tirelessly searching for ways to restore Korean reunification. It has put forward concrete proposals on this issue more than once. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea advocates that the Korean issue be resolved through free and democratic elections throughout Korea, based on an agreement between the two parts of the country and without foreign interference. However, the South Korean authorities and their patrons, like ghosts afraid of Yan Wang, are afraid of holding all-Korean elections on a democratic basis. The South Korean authorities have rejected all the proposals of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Taking into account the actual situation that has formed in the southern and northern parts of Korea, in order to ensure a mutually acceptable basis for restoring national reunification, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is now proposing a new and constructive plan for the peaceful reunification of the country. The proposal on the establishment of a North-South Korean federation is of utmost importance for preparing the necessary prerequisites for solving this task. The proposal stipulates that, while temporarily maintaining the existing political systems in North and South Korea and the independent activities of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Government the Republic of Korea, a supreme national committee composed of representatives of the two governments will be formed. The supreme national committee's authority is to conduct consultations on economic and cultural issues that benefit the entire Korea, develop economic and cultural ties and cooperation between the North and the South, and protect the common interests of all the Korean people.

The establishment of a federation does not give any one party an advantage. The two governments can jointly discuss and resolve their common problems within the federation. This can bring the South and the North closer together, help eliminate mistrust between each other, and lay a good foundation for the peaceful reunification of the country. There is no doubt that the implementation of the above suggestions will contribute to the progress of Korea, contribute to the development of Korea's relations with other countries, and ease the tensions in the region.

When the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea put forward the proposal for the establishment of a federation between the southern and northern parts of Korea, it took into account that the South Korean authorities may not be willing to agree to the establishment of a federation at this stage. Therefore, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea suggests that an economic committee composed of representatives of business circles from South and North Korea be formed as a preliminary measure, with the aim of realizing trade, economic assistance and cooperation between the two parts of the country. The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea also advocates that, while establishing economic ties, exchanges in science, culture and art should be arranged, and that the free movement and communication of residents in the North and the South should be guaranteed.

The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea correctly believes that the serious economic situation currently formed in South Korea can be smoothly overcome through the joint efforts of the South and the North. In this regard, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea expresses its willingness to provide South Korea with all kinds of assistance to improve industrial and agricultural production, and to carry out a rational division of labor between the industries in the North and the South, establish close trade ties, and so on. The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's proposal to provide assistance to South Korea demonstrates its sincere concern for the vital interests of the residents of South Korea and the entire Korean people.

If the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's proposal to reduce the number of armed forces in both the southern and northern parts of Korea to 100,000 or less could be realized, it would also be a major contribution to consolidating peace in Korea and normalizing relations between the South and the North.

In order to solve all these mature issues, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea suggests that representatives from the South and the North hold a meeting in Pyongyang, or Seoul, or the demilitarized zone to conduct negotiations. At the same time, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea expresses its willingness to negotiate with representatives of political parties, social organizations and individuals in South Korea, regardless of their political views, property status and past activities. In addition, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has repeatedly emphasized that it is willing to seriously study any suggestions put forward by the other party that are in line with the national interests of the Korean people.

It can be seen that the proposals of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have opened the door for talks between the two parts of Korea. This proposal can serve as a good basis for them to sign agreements and implement cooperation.

The new peaceful initiative of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is fully in line with the interests of the entire Korean people, and the fact that it has been embraced and supported by the broadest strata of residents in North Korea and South Korea is proof of this. It has major international significance because this initiative aims to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and eliminate this source of tension in the Far East.

The Soviet government believes that since the United Nations plans to discuss the Korean issue recently, the United Nations should allow representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and representatives of South Korea to have the right to participate in the discussion of this issue, and should demand that all foreign troops immediately withdraw from the Korean Peninsula, and abolish the so-called "Korean Unification and Reconstruction Committee," because experience shows that this committee can only hinder the unification of the country. If the United Nations takes this path, it will make a major contribution to the cause of Korean unification and consolidating peace in the Far East.

The Soviet government declares its full support for the new proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and hopes that all governments that are concerned about easing international tensions and consolidating peace in the Far East will treat this proposal, which opens the way for establishing a unified and democratic country in Korea, with due attention.

### 苏联政府就朝鲜和平统一问题发表声明  美国占领南朝鲜是朝鲜统一的主要障碍  朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的新倡议符合朝鲜民族利益有利远东和平

    苏联政府就朝鲜和平统一问题发表声明
    美国占领南朝鲜是朝鲜统一的主要障碍
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的新倡议符合朝鲜民族利益有利远东和平
    新华社8日讯塔斯社莫斯科7日电：苏联政府的声明
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府今年11月11日发表了一项《关于和平统一朝鲜》的备忘录。今年11月19日至22日举行的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议第八次会议讨论了尽快和平统一国家的问题。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的备忘录和最高人民会议第八次会议的决议提出了达到朝鲜人民所向往的目的——在和平和民主的基础上恢复朝鲜统一的广泛行动纲领。这些文件中所提出的关于建立南北朝鲜联邦的建议，为实现朝鲜人民这一全民任务开辟了现实的前景。
    苏联政府欢迎朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的新倡议，这一倡议证明了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国为争取恢复朝鲜的统一所作的一贯而坚定的努力。
    大家知道，苏联一贯地、十分坚决地致力于为消除朝鲜的分裂现象创造良好的条件。苏联政府真诚地同情朝鲜人民对于恢复民族统一的自然而合理的愿望。生活迫切地要求这一问题得到有利于朝鲜人民和有利于加强远东和平和安全的解决。但是，苏联和其他爱好和平的国家在这方面进行的努力，遭到美国及其侵略集团的盟国的顽固抗拒。
    美国占领朝鲜南部，是朝鲜统一的主要障碍。许多年来，朝鲜人民坚决要求美国军队撤退。尽管中国人民志愿军早在两年前就撤离了朝鲜，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府一再主张巩固朝鲜的和平，并且单方面地裁减自己的武装部队，但是，美国政府还是顽固地拒绝撤军。
    美国拒绝从朝鲜撤退自己的军队、不愿意促进和平解决朝鲜问题、美国黩武主义者不断叫喊要进一步加固它在南朝鲜的军事基地、并违背停战协定把大规模毁灭性武器运往那里，所有这一切是美国政府侵略性外交政策的环节。它企图通过损害朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的利益和把殖民主义制度扩展到整个朝鲜半岛的方法来解决朝鲜问题。但是现在，甚至西方国家最顽固不化的政客，显然也了解到，企图通过武力来达到这个目的，是一种幻想。
    如果从对局势的清醒估计出发，那么就不能不考虑到，在朝鲜半岛上形成了在实质上具有不同政治和经济制度的两个国家。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国已经成为工业—农业社会主义国家。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的工业生产比1944年增长了六点七倍。国家建立了重工业基础，建成了钢铁和有色金属的现代化大企业，建立了机器制造业、强大的电站和轻工业企业。合作化的农业现在所提供的谷物比战前多一倍。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国居民的物质生活水平正在不断提高。
    南朝鲜形成了另外一种情况。在美国刺刀的帮助下，在那里建立了警察恐怖和饥饿统治。南朝鲜的工农业生产水平大大低于日本统治时代的水平。经常有大批的失业者，农民饥馑逃荒。人民丧失了起码的权利和自由。人民终于达到了忍无可忍的境地，所以在今年春天，外国的走狗、血腥统治者李承晚被迫逃出朝鲜。南朝鲜人民的起义令人信服地表明了，南朝鲜居民不愿再容忍别人强加于他们的反动统治了。美国的殖民主义政策遭到可耻的破产。
    在存在着社会制度不同的两个国家的条件下，不能用强迫一国接受另一国的意志的方法、尤其是不能企图用暴力把国家的一部并入另一部的方法来恢复国家的统一。
    对民族今后的命运深切关怀的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府不倦地在寻找恢复朝鲜统一的途径。它不止一次地就这个问题提出具体的建议。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国主张，根据国家两个部分的协议，在没有外国干涉的条件下，举行全朝鲜的自由民主选举，来解决朝鲜问题。但是，南朝鲜当局及其庇护人，像小鬼怕阎王一样，害怕在民主的基础上举行全朝鲜选举。南朝鲜当局拒绝了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的一切建议。
    考虑到朝鲜南部和北部已经形成的实际情况，为了保证彼此可以接受的恢复民族统一的基础，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国现在提出和平统一国家的新的建设性计划。关于建立南北朝鲜联邦的建议对于为解决这个任务准备必要的前提，具有极其重要的意义。建议规定，在暂时保持南北朝鲜的现有政治制度和保持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和大韩民国政府的自主活动的条件下，由两个政府的代表组成最高民族委员会。最高民族委员会的权限是就经济和文化问题进行有利于整个朝鲜的磋商，发展北部和南部的经济、文化联系和合作，保护全体朝鲜人民的共同利益。
    成立联邦并不使任何一方占据优势。两个政府可以在联邦范围内共同讨论和解决他们共同的问题。这可以使南部和北部接近起来，会有助于消除彼此的不信任，会为和平统一国家奠定良好的开端。毫无疑问，实现上述建议会有助于朝鲜的进步、有助于发展朝鲜同其他国家的联系，会使这个地区的紧张局势得到缓和。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在提出朝鲜南部和北部成立联邦的主张时，考虑到朝鲜南部当局可能在现阶段还不愿意同意成立联邦。因此，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府建议由朝鲜南部和北部实业界代表组成一个旨在实现国家南北两部间的贸易、经济援助和合作的经济委员会来作为初步措施。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府还主张，在建立经济联系的同时，安排科学、文化、艺术方面的交往，保证南北两部居民自由迁徙和通信。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府正确地认为，目前南朝鲜所形成的严重的经济状况，可以通过南部和北部的共同努力顺利地克服。在这方面，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国表示愿意给予南朝鲜各方面的援助来提高工农业生产，并在南北部工业之间进行合理的劳动分工，建立紧密的贸易联系等等。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府提出对南朝鲜进行援助，表现了对南朝鲜居民和全体朝鲜人民切身重大利益的真诚关怀。
    如能实现朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府关于把朝鲜南北两部武装部队人数各裁减到十万人或十万人以下的建议，那也是对巩固朝鲜的和平和使南北两方关系正常化的重大贡献。
    为了解决这一切成熟的问题，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府建议，南北两部代表在平壤、或是汉城、或是非军事区举行会议来进行谈判。同时，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府表示愿意同南朝鲜政党、社会团体的代表和个别人士进行谈判，不问他们的政治观点、财产状况和过去活动如何。此外，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府一再着重指出，它愿意认真地研究对方提出的符合朝鲜人民民族利益的任何建议。
    可见，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的建议为朝鲜两部分之间举行会谈，打开了大门。这个建议可以作为它们之间签订协定和实行合作的良好基础。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的新和平倡议完全符合全体朝鲜人民的利益，这个倡议获得了朝鲜北部和朝鲜南部最广大居民阶层的拥护和支持，这点就是一个证明。它有着重大的国际意义，因为这个倡议旨在和平解决朝鲜问题并消除远东紧张局势的这个根源。
    苏联政府认为，既然联合国计划最近讨论朝鲜问题，那么联合国就应当让朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表和南朝鲜代表都有权参加讨论这个问题，就应当要求所有外国军队立即撤出朝鲜半岛，并取消所谓“韩国统一复兴委员会”，因为经验表明，这个委员会只能阻碍国家的统一。联合国如果走上这条道路，就会对朝鲜人民的统一和巩固远东和平的事业作出重大贡献。
    苏联政府声明完全支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的新建议，并希望所有关心缓和国际紧张局势、关心巩固远东和平的各国政府以应有的注意对待这个为在朝鲜建立统一的民主国家开辟道路的建议。
