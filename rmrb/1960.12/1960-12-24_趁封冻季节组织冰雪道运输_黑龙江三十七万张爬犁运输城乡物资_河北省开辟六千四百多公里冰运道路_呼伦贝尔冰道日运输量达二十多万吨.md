    Organizing Ice and Snow Road Transport During the Freeze Season
    Heilongjiang: 370,000 Sleds Transport Urban and Rural Goods
    Hebei Province Opens Over 6,400 Kilometers of Ice Transport Routes
    Hulunbuir: Daily Ice Road Transport Volume Reaches Over 200,000 Tons

    (Our dispatch from Harbin, December 23rd) Heilongjiang Province has entered the busy season of ice and snow road transport. On more than 1,800 rivers, large and small, throughout the province, over 370,000 various sleds of all sizes travel back and forth. Some are pulled by animals, and some are mechanically towed. This vast transportation force carries grain, timber, coal, and building materials from rural areas and railway stations to the cities; and brings daily necessities and means of production from the cities to the countryside.

    Ice and snow road transport is a traditional transportation method in Heilongjiang Province. Every winter, people use sleds to transport goods. This winter, Party organizations at all levels throughout the province have focused on ice and snow road transport, mobilizing rural people's communes, organizations, enterprises, industrial and mining areas, and forestry areas to build sleds on a large scale. Currently, in addition to the professional sled transport teams organized by the transportation departments, factories, mines, enterprises, trade departments, organizations, and urban and rural people's communes have widely organized employees, residents, and commune members to participate in ice and snow road transport, based on their own department's freight situation. Staff from the Beian City commercial system used old scrap boards to make more than 1,400 sleds and, in ten days, rushed to transport nearly 2,000 tons of urgently needed market goods. Jixi City mobilized the entire city's residents to manufacture and repair more than 40,000 sleds, poured more than 130 kilometers of ice and snow roads, and transported large quantities of coal, ore, and building materials. In organizing residents and commune members to participate in ice and snow road transport, all urban and rural people's communes reasonably set prices according to the distance, settling accounts after each trip.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 23rd) Staff of the Hebei Province shipping departments are taking advantage of the severe cold and freezing season to vigorously develop ice transportation. As of now, the province has opened over 6,400 kilometers of ice transport routes, manufactured and repaired more than 50,000 various ice sleds. In the first half of December alone, the volume of materials transported by ice, including steel, coal, agricultural machinery, and a large number of daily industrial products, reached more than 256,000 tons.

    Hebei Province has many rivers and lakes, providing conditions for developing ice transportation. This winter, more than 25% of the province's short-distance transportation tasks will be carried out on ice roads. As early as before winter, transportation leading departments from the provincial and municipal levels to the county levels mobilized the masses to conduct comprehensive preparation work, including ice sled manufacturing and repair, ice road surveying, and personnel allocation. Zhangjiakou area in northern Hebei Province, where the freezing period is long, made early preparations. By the end of November, the area had repaired and manufactured more than 15,000 ice sleds, opened more than 1,800 kilometers of ice roads, organized an ice transport team of more than 4,000 people, and begun transportation.

    All localities attach great importance to the lives of ice transport workers in organizing ice transport work. Shipping departments have considered and properly arranged for the food and lodging of workers in terms of cargo organization, labor allocation, and the combination of long-distance and short-distance transportation, to ensure that workers eat well and rest well.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot) With the arrival of severe winter, Hulunbuir League in northern Inner Mongolia has once again started mass activities using ice and snow road transport. More than 20,000 machine-pulled and horse-drawn sleighs throughout the League are participating in this short-distance transportation, with a daily freight volume reaching 200,000 to 300,000 tons.

    Vigorously developing ice and snow road transport in winter is an effective measure for the people of all ethnic groups in Hulunbuir League to utilize natural conditions to accelerate transportation speed. Since the beginning of winter this year, various localities have opened up a large number of ice and snow roads. Workers in the Greater Khingan Mountains forestry area have excavated more than 3,000 ice ditches in the forests this winter. Large quantities of timber are felled from the mountains and then slid down these ice roads to the loading yards, increasing the average daily timber collection volume in November to 17,000 cubic meters, 5,000 cubic meters more than the average daily timber collection volume in October.

    趁封冻季节组织冰雪道运输
    黑龙江三十七万张爬犁运输城乡物资
    河北省开辟六千四百多公里冰运道路
    呼伦贝尔冰道日运输量达二十多万吨
    本报哈尔滨23日电　黑龙江省各地已进入冰雪道运输的繁忙季节，境内一千八百多条大小河流上，三十七万多张各式各样、大大小小的爬犁往来行驶着。其中有畜力拉的，也有机械牵引的，这支庞大的运输力量，从农村和火车站把粮食、木材、煤炭和建筑材料运往城市；又从城市里把日用百货、生产资料运送到乡村。
    冰雪道运输，在黑龙江省是一种传统性的运输方式，每年冬季，人们就使用爬犁来运输货物。今年进入冬季，全省各级党组织，就大抓冰雪道运输工作，发动农村人民公社、机关、企业、工矿林区大造爬犁。现在，全省除了交通运输部门已组织了一批专业爬犁运输队伍外，各厂矿、企业、财贸部门、机关、城乡人民公社，都根据本部门的货运情况，广泛地组织了职工、居民、社员等参加了冰雪道运输。北安市商业系统职工，用破旧碎板制造出一千四百多张爬犁，经过十天的时间，抢运了将近二千吨当前市场急需的物资。鸡西市发动全市人民制造和修复了四万多张爬犁，浇筑了冰雪道一百三十多公里，运输了大批的煤炭、矿石和建筑材料等。各城乡人民公社在组织居民、社员参加冰雪道运输中，都按照距离的远近，合理地规定了价格，运一次清一次账。
    据新华社天津23日电　河北省航运部门职工乘着严寒封冻季节，大力发展冰上运输。截至目前，全省已开辟冰运道路六千四百多公里，制造和整修各种冰床五万多只，仅12月上半月，由冰上运输的钢铁、煤炭、农业机具和大批日用工业品等物资，就达二十五万六千多吨。
    河北省河流湖泊多，有开展冰上运输的条件。今年冬季全省将有25％以上的短途运输任务在冰道上进行。早在入冬前，从省、市到县各级运输领导部门，就发动群众，进行了冰床制造修整、冰道勘察、人员配备等全面的准备工作。结冰时间长的河北省北部张家口地区，由于准备工作作得早，到11月底全区已整修、制造了冰床一万五千多只，开辟冰道一千八百多公里，组织了四千多人的冰运队伍，开始运输。
    各地在组织冰运工作中，都十分重视冰运职工生活。航运部门在货源组织、劳力调配、长短途运输结合等方面，都考虑和妥善安排了职工的食宿，保证职工吃好、休息好。
    据新华社呼和浩特电　严冬到来，内蒙古北部呼伦贝尔盟各地又开始了群众性地利用冰雪道运输的活动。全盟有二万多个机引和马拉雪橇，参加了这种短途运输，每天货运量达到二、三十万吨。
    冬季大搞冰雪道运输，是呼伦贝尔盟各族人民利用自然条件加快运输速度的有效措施。今年入冬以来，各地又开辟了大量冰雪道。大兴安岭林区职工，今冬在森林里开挖了三千多条冰沟，大量木材从山上采伐下来后就沿这些冰道滑放到山下装车场，使11月份平均每天集材量达到一万七千立方米，比10月份平均日集材量提高五千立方米。（附图片）
