In a Commune of Seven Nationalities
By our reporters Miji Duoerji and Guo Pingyong

North of the Greater Khingan Range, on the banks of the Hui River, a people's commune composed of seven nationalities—the Hui River People's Commune—has, after three years of hard work, changed the face of the Hasan Grassland. Agricultural and pastoral production has greatly developed, and the lives of the commune members have also greatly improved. Here, Mongolian, Han, Daur, Ewenki, Hui, Tibetan, and Tu commune members gather together, united and loving each other in building a new socialist life, working together to transform a remote and backward grassland pastoral area into a prosperous place "with thriving people and livestock, abundant crops, national unity, and common progress."

		The Bowstring That Cannot Be Broken

In early winter, we visited the Hasan Grassland. From the grassland city of Hailar to the Hui River People's Commune, there is a wide grassland highway. Cars race along the smooth road, and the vast pastures on both sides of the road are covered with a thin layer of frost. In the distance and nearby, herds of cattle and sheep appear from time to time, and tractors flash in the fertile newly cultivated land, busily engaged in winter transportation. Whether on the commune's pastures or in the bustling Tie Mu (Iron & Wood) factory, groups of male and female commune members are working happily.

Thirteen years ago, the Hasan Grassland was a poor place. All ethnic groups suffered from the exploitation and oppression of reactionary rule. Life was very hard. Herdsmen had an average of less than seven head of livestock per person, and farmers had no land. Herdsmen could not afford to make wool felt tents, and in winter they had to use reeds to enclose their yurts. It was not until liberation in 1947 that the Hasan Grassland gradually changed. The lives of the herdsmen gradually improved. In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the sound of "People's Communes are good" spread from Beijing to the grasslands. People on both banks of the Hui River came and went frequently, discussing one thing together: "A twisted bowstring cannot be broken. Let's Mongolians, Hans, Daurs, Ewenkis... jointly set up a people's commune!"

Thus, the Hui River People's Commune was born on the remote Hasan Grassland. When the news of the formal establishment of the People's Commune reached the pasture, a pair of young herdsmen wrestled on the lawn with joy. The two young men were shepherds, one was Sesiren of the Mongolian nationality, and the other was Jiabudai of the Ewenki nationality. During the Great Leap Forward, the two young men each led a production team to encourage each other and carry out friendly competitions. This autumn, Sesiren and Jiabudai once again responded to the call of the commune's Party committee and organized two hay-making teams, taking two horse-drawn hay-making machines and setting up their yurts on the wasteland to conduct friendly competitions and rush to store forage for livestock to survive the winter and spring. However, just as the competition was in full swing, Sesiren's team's machine broke down, and the amount of hay they made could not keep up with Jiabudai's team. The young men were sweating profusely. One day, Jiabudai heard the news and took tools to Sesiren's team to help them repair the machine. After working hard for a long time, the machine was repaired. The members of Sesiren's team happily shook Jiabudai's hand and said, "We guarantee to give you the red banner of victory." Two days later, Sesiren heard that the grass-raking efficiency of Jiabudai's team was low and could not keep up with the progress of his team. So he personally took a grass-raking machine to help Jiabudai's team make hay. In this way, they competed with each other, helped each other, and fought hard on the wasteland for three months, storing more than 4.6 million catties of green grass for the commune's livestock, more than double the amount of last year.

Members of all ethnic groups helped each other, encouraged each other, and fought together, resulting in the continuous improvement of production and life on the grassland. In the past three years, thanks to the diligent and thrifty efforts of the commune's herdsmen, the number of livestock increased by one-third more than in the ten years before 1958. Moreover, veterinary stations have been established in the pastoral areas, and more than ten new hay-making and raking machines have been added. Each production team has trained a large number of epidemic prevention and breeding technicians.

Three years ago, the herdsmen of the Hasan Grassland still did not know how to farm. Only the Han farmers who came from the south sporadically grew some vegetables and millet. Last year, the commune organized a group of young and middle-aged herdsmen to learn how to grow crops from the Han farmers. Herdsmen and farmers set up their yurts on the wasteland, herdsmen pulling cattle and farmers holding plows, working in the wind and rain, reclaiming and sowing dozens of acres of land, and harvesting more than 30,000 catties of grain feed for the first time. Many elderly people were so excited to see the grain produced on their own grassland that they shed tears: "Our Hasan Grassland has finally grown grain!" This year, more herdsmen and Han commune members worked side by side to reclaim wasteland, fighting from the early spring with rain and snow to the cold late autumn, expanding the sown area by more than twice as much as last year, and harvesting more than 150,000 catties of grain and feed.

		Newly Built Pastoral Villages

When the People's Commune was established, the herdsmen celebrated the birth of the commune in yurts in nomadic areas. Now, as we tour the Hasan Grassland, we often see patches of new houses. People come and go in the settlements, ox carts and horsemen shuttle back and forth, and large areas of newly cultivated land are next to the villages. These are all new settlements that have grown with the consolidation and development of the Hui River Commune.

We visited the commune's central area and the two new villages of Hasan Al.

The settlement in the commune's central area is relatively large. In the middle of the village is an iron and wood processing factory, where six or seven Mongolian and Han commune members are repairing and assembling small farm tools for spring plowing, tools for pastoral production, and making doors and windows for permanent housing. These are all new production departments that have emerged with the establishment of settlements. Not far from the factory, several people are laying the foundation for the commune's small power plant. A commune member excitedly told us: "The Hasan Grassland will be even brighter. We will be able to generate electricity and illuminate it for the Spring Festival in 1961." At the west end of the village is a clinic, where two doctors are treating herdsmen. A patient named Shanbu is almost cured. Before settling down, there were no clinics on the Hasan Grassland. If herdsmen were sick, they had to go dozens of miles away to ask for a doctor. Now it is much more convenient to see a doctor. The village's herdsmen's cafeteria is spacious and clean. In addition to rice and dishes, the cafeteria also prepares vinegar and oil milk tea and various dairy products according to the habits of Ewenki and Mongolian herdsmen. To the east of the village are the school and residential area. There is a sewing group, a shoe repair group, and a barbershop here.

Hasan Al Village is composed of more than 20 houses and more than 10 yurts. Each farming and herding family lives in one to three new houses. Each new house has glass windows, and the interior has a fire wall and a heated kang (platform bed), which is warm and comfortable, completely different from the living conditions during nomadic times. Comrade Du Ke, secretary of the commune's Party committee, told us: Since the establishment of the commune, thanks to the help of the state and the development of the commune's production, commune members have built more than 300 new houses, and 260 nomadic families have moved into such new homes, accounting for more than two-thirds of the total number of households in the commune. In the construction of the settlement, this year five Ewenki herdsmen in Hasan Al Village also learned how to build houses from Han commune members.

When we arrived at the home of Batu, an Ewenki herdsman, several children were playing on the kang. Although it was a cold season with temperatures below ten degrees Celsius, they did not feel any cold. Batu had just returned from work and was sitting by the fire wall drinking milk tea. As soon as he saw us, he started talking: "There have been so many happy events here since the start of the Great Leap Forward! Not to mention anything else, our herdsmen have settled down, and life has improved. Just look at how many children have been born. There are four on our kang, and the fifth one is about to be born." The commune's Party committee told us: In the early days of liberation, there was an average of one child for every eight households in the commune. Now, there is an average of two children per household.

In the past year or so, 27 pairs of young men and women of various ethnic groups on the Hasan Grassland have established love and married in common labor.

		Moving Forward Hand in Hand

Since the establishment of the commune, a new communist ethos of "one person in trouble, everyone helps; mutual learning and mutual teaching; moving forward hand in hand" has quickly formed among the people of all ethnic groups on the Hasan Grassland. In the early summer of last year, the commune's Party committee decided to ask Batu, an Ewenki herdsman, to learn how to grow crops. Han farmers who were reclaiming wasteland and farming were happy to hear this news and said to him: "We will definitely teach you well. We must help each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, and build the grassland even more beautifully."

The next day at work, the farmer asked Batu to walk on the left and he went to the right, and the two of them held a plow to reclaim the wasteland. After work, some Han farmers went to Batu's home to ask him questions and patiently explained to him how to hold the plow and sow seeds. Batu was very moved and thought that if he did not learn how to farm quickly, how could he be worthy of his Han farmer brothers? So, the next day, as soon as it dawned, Batu ran to the field to learn how to hold the plow from the farmers, asking questions and working hard for three consecutive days. The plowing cattle became obedient. Batu learned how to hold the plow, reclaim the wasteland, sow seeds, and spread seeds. This year, he became a genuine farmer, planting 30 acres of land, and hauling dozens of carts of harvested wheat and vegetables. The herdsmen happily praised him as the commune's "agronomist." More than 30 herdsmen who worked with Batu have now become the first batch of commune members who are both farmers and herdsmen. Some Han farmer commune members are now also learning pastoral knowledge from their farmer brothers every day, and the herdsmen are also patiently teaching them hand in hand.

How short a time three years is, and how great the changes in the Hasan Grassland are. In the journey of continued leaps forward in the future, we can imagine that the seven brothers on both banks of the Hui River will definitely build the Hasan Grassland even more beautifully. (Attached picture)

    在七个民族的公社里
    本报记者　密吉德道尔基　郭平永
    大兴安岭北，辉河两岸，一个由七个民族组成的人民公社——辉河人民公社，经过三年来艰苦奋斗，已经改变了哈珊草原的面貌，农牧业生产有了很大发展，社员生活也有很大改善。在这里，蒙、汉、达斡尔、鄂温克、回、藏和土族社员，欢聚一堂，在建设社会主义新生活中，团结友爱，共同劳动，用自己的双手，把一个偏僻落后的草原牧区，已经建设成为一个“人畜两旺，五谷丰登，民族团结，共同进步”的繁荣兴旺的地方。
          拉不断的弓弦
    初冬，我们访问了哈珊草原。从草原城市海拉尔到辉河人民公社，有一条宽广的草原公路。汽车在平坦的大道上奔驰，公路两旁辽阔的牧场上，铺了一层薄薄的霜。远方和近处，不时出现一群群牛羊，一片片肥沃的新垦地里，闪动着拖拉机，忙忙碌碌在搞冬季运输。不论在公社的牧场上、喧闹的铁木工厂里，一群群男女社员都在愉快的劳动着。
    十三年前，哈珊草原是个穷地方。各族人民共同受反动统治的剥削、压榨，生活过得很苦，牧民每人平均不到七头牲畜，农民没有一垅土地。牧民们做不起羊毛毡子，冬天只好用苇子当蒙古包围起来住。1947年解放，哈珊草原才逐渐变了样。牧民的日子过得逐渐好起来了。1958年大跃进，“人民公社好”的声音，从北京城传到了草原上，辉河两岸的人们，来往频繁，共同商量着一件事：“拧成的弓弦是拉不断的。咱们蒙古人、汉人、达斡尔人、鄂温克人……合力办个人民公社！”
    辉河人民公社就这样在偏僻的哈珊草原上诞生了。正式成立人民公社的消息传到牧场上的时候，有一对青年牧民，高兴得在草坪上摔起跤来。这对青年是牧羊人，一个是蒙族的色斯仁，另一个是鄂温克族的贾布岱。这两个青年在大跃进中各领导一个生产小组互相鼓舞，开展友谊竞赛。今年秋季，色斯仁和贾布岱，再次响应公社党委号召，组织两个打草队，带着两台马拉打草机，把蒙古包搭在荒草滩上，开展友谊竞赛，突击为牲畜过冬渡春贮备饲草。可是竞赛正在热火朝天进行的时候，色斯仁小组的机器出了毛病，打草量怎么也赶不上贾布岱小组，小伙子们急得浑身冒汗。一天，贾布岱听到这消息，就带着工具跑到色斯仁小组帮色斯仁小组修理机器。几个人忙碌了半天，机器修好了。色斯仁小组的社员们高兴得紧握贾布岱的手说：“优胜红旗保证送给你们。”过了两天，色斯仁听到贾布岱小组的搂草效率低，赶不上自己小组的进度。于是他亲自带着一台搂草机，去帮贾布岱小组打草。他们就这样在荒滩草原上，互相竞赛，彼此相帮，奋战三个月，为公社牲畜贮备了四百六十多万斤青草，比去年多了一倍。
    各族社员，就这样彼此帮助，互相鼓励，共同奋战的结果，使草原上的生产和生活一天一天地好起来。三年来，由于公社各族牧民社员克勤克俭地努力生产，使全公社增殖的牲畜，比1958年前十年增长的头数还多三分之一。而且在牧区成立了兽医站，新添了十多台打搂草机。各生产队培养了不少的防疫配种技术人员。
    三年前，哈珊草原牧民还是不会种地的。只有南来的汉族农民，零星种些蔬菜和糜子。去年，公社组织一批青壮年牧民，向汉族农民学种庄稼。牧民和农民，把蒙古包搭在荒滩上，牧民拉着牛，农民扶着犁，风里雨里，开荒播种几十亩地，第一次收获了三万多斤粮食饲料。许多老年人，看了自己草原上出产的粮食，兴奋得流出眼泪：“咱们的哈珊草原，到底长出粮食来了！”今年更多的牧民和汉族社员并肩开荒，从雨雪的初春，奋战到寒冷的秋末，又比去年扩大播种面积两倍多，收获了十五万多斤粮食和饲料。
          新建的牧村
    人民公社成立的时候，牧民们还是在游牧地的蒙古包里庆祝公社诞生的。现在，当我们巡礼在哈珊草原的时候，不时看到一片片新房。定居地上人群往来，牛车和骑马的人，穿来穿去，村边就是大面积的新垦土地。这都是随着辉河公社的巩固和发展成长起来的定居新村。
    我们访问了公社中心区和哈珊阿尔两个新村。
    公社中心区定居村规模较大。村中间有一座铁木加工厂，六、七名蒙汉族社员，正在修配明年春耕生产用的小农具、牧业生产用的工具和制做定居房屋的门窗。这都是随着定居而出现的新型的生产部门。离工厂不远，有几个人正为公社小型发电厂打地基，有个社员兴奋地告诉我们：“哈珊草原要更亮，1961年 春节我们就能给她发电照明。”村西头还有医疗所，有两名医生正给牧民看病。有一位名叫善布的患者，病已经快好了。定居以前，哈珊草原上没有医疗所，牧民有点病，还得到数十里外去请医生。现在看病可方便多了。村里的牧民食堂，又宽畅，又干净。食堂一日三餐，除了饭菜以外，还按照鄂温克、蒙古族牧民习惯，准备有醋油奶茶和各种乳食品。村东边是学校和居民区。这里有缝纫组、修靴组和理发室。
    哈珊阿尔村由二十多间房子和十多座蒙古包组成。每户农牧民住着一间到三间新房，一幢幢新房子，安着玻璃窗，室内有火墙、火炕，暖烘烘的，和游牧时期的居住条件完全两样的。公社党委书记杜柯同志告诉我们：公社化以后，由于国家的帮助和公社生产的发展，社员们盖了三百多间新房，已经有二百六十户游牧民搬进这样的新居，占全社户数的三分之二以上。在定居地的建设中，今年哈珊阿尔村的五名鄂温克族牧民，还向汉族社员学会了盖房子。
    我们到鄂温克族牧民巴图家的时候，几个孩子在炕上耍，外面虽是零下十多度的寒冷季节，他们不觉一点寒意。巴图刚劳动回来，正坐在火墙边喝奶茶。他一见我们就谈起来了：“大跃进一开始，咱们这里喜事可多啦！别的不说，咱们牧民定居，生活好了，光孩子生了多少。我们炕上就有四个，第五个也快出世了。”公社党委告诉我们：解放初期，全社平均每八户才有一个孩子，现在平均一户就有两个孩子了。
    最近一年多，哈珊草原上有二十七对各民族男女青壮年，在共同的劳动中，建立爱情，结了婚。
            携手前进
    公社成立以来，在哈珊草原各族人民中很快形成了“一人有难，众人相帮，互学互教，携手前进”的共产主义新风尚。去年初夏，公社党委决定叫鄂温克族牧民巴图学种庄稼，开荒种田的汉族农民知道这消息后高兴地对他说：“我们一定把你教会教好。咱们一定要互相帮助，取长补短，把草原建设得更加美好”。
    第二天一上工，农民叫巴图走在左边，自己到右边，两人扶着一杖犁开荒。下工后，有的汉族农民到巴图家，向他问长问短，给他耐心地讲把犁、播种方法。巴图心里很受感动，心想不赶紧学会种田，怎能对得起汉族农民兄弟呢？于是次日天一亮巴图就跑到地里，用心学习农民扶犁，问长问短，一连苦干了三天，犁牛听话了。扶犁、开荒、播种、撒籽，巴图全学会了。今年他成了个地道的农民，种了三十亩地，收获的麦个子、蔬菜拉了几十车，牧民们高兴地称赞他是“公社的‘农艺师’”。和巴图一起劳动的三十多个牧民，现在也成了公社第一批亦农亦牧的社员。有些汉族农民社员现在也天天跟着农民兄弟学习牧业知识，牧民们也是手把手地耐心教他们。
    三年的时间是何等短暂啊，而哈珊草原变化有多么大。在今后继续跃进的里程里，我们可以想像得到辉河两岸七兄弟一定会把哈珊草原建设得更加美好。（附图片）
