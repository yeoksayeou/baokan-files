Comprehensive Utilization of Coal Expands Fuel Sources
Shanghai Uses Coke Oven Gas to Power Cars

Shanghai has successfully used coke oven gas as fuel for automobiles. The majority of the city's thousands of freight and passenger vehicles have been converted to run on gas. This important innovation has opened up new avenues for using gaseous fuels more widely to support increased grain and steel production. The Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Commerce recently jointly held an on-site meeting in Shanghai to promote this experience.

In Shanghai, the common method of using gas in automobiles is to fill large rubberized fabric bags with gas and place them on the roof or on top of the cargo. The city has established fifty fixed gas filling stations and many temporary supply stations to facilitate bag changes mid-journey. According to relevant departments' measurements, one bag of 4.8 cubic meters of gas can power a fully loaded truck for about ten kilometers. Recently, the transportation department has also been compressing the gas into sealed steel cylinders, which store more gas, last longer, and are safer. Currently, the city uses 190,000 cubic meters of gas per day for automobiles.

The gas produced by Shanghai's large-scale coke gasification plants, while meeting the needs of industrial production and residential life, can free up a portion for automobile use. Many simple coke ovens and earthen coke kilns also provide a portion of the gas. The method of recovering and utilizing gas from simple coke ovens and earthen kilns is as follows: steel pipes are connected to the coal tar extraction equipment; the gas released from the coke oven is completely collected after the oil is extracted, and then passes through four or five old iron drums filled with coke, wood chips, and iron oxide. After cooling, it is further deoiled and desulfurized, becoming gas suitable for automobiles. With this simple structure, economical materials, and convenient operation, about ten cubic meters of gas can be extracted from each ton of coking coal. The amount of this gas used by Shanghai's transportation department is constantly increasing.

Shanghai's use of gas as fuel for automobile transportation has yielded good results. First, it uses less gasoline and hauls more goods, powerfully supporting increased grain and steel production. Second, it has opened up a new source of automobile fuel. Third, the purified gas entering the automobile cylinders is very uniform and burns completely, reducing wear on parts and extending vehicle life. The use of gas in buses is also safe, fast, and clean. Fourth, it further expands the comprehensive utilization of coal.

    综合利用煤炭　扩大燃料来源
    上海利用炼焦煤气开汽车
    上海利用炼焦煤气作汽车燃料成功。全市数千辆运货和载客汽车，大部分已改用煤气发动。这一重要革新，为更广泛地运用气体燃料支援粮、钢增产开辟了新的途径。交通部和商业部不久以前在上海联合召开现场会议，推广了这一经验。
    上海市在汽车上使用煤气，比较普遍的办法是把煤气灌进胶布大口袋，放在车顶或货物上面。全市设立了五十个固定的煤气加气站和许多便于汽车中途换袋的临时供应站。据有关部门测定，一袋四点八立方米的煤气，可供一般满载货物的卡车跑十公里左右。最近，交通部门又把煤气压进密封的钢桶，贮气更多，用的时间更长，也更安全。目前，全市每天用于汽车的煤气已达十九万立方米。
    上海大型炼焦制气厂生产的煤气，在供应工业生产、居民生活需要的同时，可以腾出一部分供汽车使用。不少简易焦炉和炼焦土窑，也提供了一部分煤气。回收利用简易焦炉和土窑煤气的办法是：用钢管接在提炼煤焦油的设备上，炼焦炉放出的煤气提过油后就被完全收集起来，先后通过盛有焦炭、木屑、氧化铁的四五只旧铁桶，经过冷却，进一步除油，脱硫，就成为适用于汽车的煤气。用这种结构简单、用料经济、使用方便的土设备，可以从每吨炼焦煤中提取十立方米左右的煤气。上海市交通部门使用这种煤气的数量正在不断增加。
    上海市汽车运输用煤气作燃料已经收得良好效果。首先，少用汽油多拉货，有力地支援了粮、钢增产。其次，开辟了汽车燃料的新来源。第三，净化后的煤气进入汽车气缸，很均匀，燃烧完全，减少机件磨耗，延长了车辆寿命。公共汽车使用煤气，也安全、迅速、清洁。第四，进一步扩大了煤的综合利用。
