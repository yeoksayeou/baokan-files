Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 19th: The “Voice of Laos” radio station of the Lao legitimate government, relayed today by the Pathet Lao Fighting Units radio station, broadcast on December 18th a declaration from the Lao National Committee for Peace, Neutrality, National Harmony and Unification to the entire nation, strongly condemning the crimes of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in invading Laos. At the same time, it called on people of all strata in Laos to unite as one, strengthen the struggle, and strive for the liberation of the motherland.

The declaration listed a large number of facts, exposing the intervention of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in Laos, and their instigation of the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Naciampsack traitorous clique to attack Vientiane, bringing profound disasters to the Lao people. The declaration said that this serious catastrophe was brought to our people by U.S. imperialism and the reactionary Thai government. They must bear full responsibility for their despicable and inhumane actions.

The declaration pointed out that the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique, which introduced foreign reactionaries into the country to trample on Lao sovereignty, burn the homes of the Lao people, and kill Lao people, must bear full responsibility before the Lao people and history for the heinous crimes they have committed. All the Lao people will never forget the crimes they have committed.

The declaration said, we would like to suggest to Prince Souvanna Phouma's government, all patriotic parties, the people of the whole country, all nationalities, and people from all walks of life, to designate December 13 as the nation's "Day of Hatred." We hope that all people and monks will remember the compatriots in the capital who were killed, and keep the hatred of U.S. imperialism, Thai reactionaries, and the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique engraved in their hearts.

The declaration pointed out that in order to preserve our strength, although the troops and youth have withdrawn from Vientiane, our struggle has not weakened in the slightest, on the contrary, it will become more intense. The declaration said, we must unite with the people and armed forces of the whole country, resolutely continue to struggle against the U.S. imperialist aggressors, the Thai reactionaries, and the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique, and further liberate the capital and the motherland.

The declaration called on all peace-loving countries in the world, especially the Asian and African countries that abide by the Bandung Spirit and oppose imperialism, to support the just struggle of the Lao people.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 21st: According to a broadcast by the "Voice of Laos" radio station on the evening of the 20th, Propaganda Minister Quinim Pholsena, representing the legitimate government of Phouma, Captain Kong Le, and the National Committee for Peace, Neutrality, National Harmony and Unification, visited thousands of people who had evacuated from Vientiane with the troops.

Among them were civil servants, youth, students and monks. In the battles to defend Vientiane, they bravely participated in resisting the aggression of U.S. imperialism and Thai reactionaries, as well as the attacks of the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique.

The broadcast said that these evacuated people from the Lao capital were warmly received by local authorities and local people, and received enthusiastic help in all aspects. The Lao Patriotic Front's local committee also called on the people to carry forward the tradition of uniting to fight, and pointed out that this struggle is long-term and arduous, but will eventually be victorious. During the visits, all civil servants expressed that no matter what difficulties they encounter, they felt honored to be able to contribute to the Lao people's long-term struggle for national salvation.

The youth and students also expressed their utmost hatred for U.S. imperialism, Thai reactionaries, and the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique who brought in foreign aggressors to ravage the Lao people.

According to the broadcast, a monk, representing all the monks, said in a speech, "We monks are people who practice asceticism, but facing the tragic scene of U.S. imperialism, Thai reactionaries, and the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique cruelly slaughtering the people of Vientiane, we cannot stand idly by."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 21st: According to a broadcast by the "Voice of Laos" radio station, people and armed personnel from all over Laos have recently written letters and sent telegrams to the Kingdom's troops, police, Pathet Lao Fighting Units, youth and people who defended Vientiane, expressing their support and sympathy for their heroic struggle against the attacks of U.S. imperialism, Thai reactionaries and the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique.

A public notice issued by Captain Kong Le, the commander of the Vientiane garrison, broadcast by the radio station on the evening of the 20th, said: The troops and police who received these letters and telegrams expressed their gratitude, and they guaranteed to continue to carry forward the spirit of national salvation, support the legitimate government of Souvanna Phouma, and stand shoulder to shoulder with the patriotic soldiers and civilians of the whole country to resolutely oppose the aggression of U.S. imperialism and Thai reactionaries and the traitorous acts of the Phoumi-Boun Oum clique.
