Vigorously Develop China's Geological Science
Xiao Ying, Vice President of Beijing Geological College

The Earth is the place where human activities occur. Human scientific understanding of the Earth began very early, but geology only gradually developed into an independent science with the improvement of modern industrial productivity, and it has only been around for about two hundred years. Geology originates from production practice, and the speed of its development in a country often reflects the level of productivity.

Our working people have accumulated rich experience in mining, excavating canals, utilizing groundwater, and fighting against natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods since ancient times. China is the first country in the world to use coal; salt wells were dug in Sichuan before the Qin Dynasty. The achievements of the ancient Chinese working people in water conservancy construction were even more outstanding. The Zheng Guo Canal, built during the Warring States period, not only facilitated irrigation but also successfully diverted groundwater and improved saline-alkali land. As for the large and small mineral deposits found by working people throughout the ages, they are too numerous to mention.

Due to China's long stagnation in the feudal social stage, the development of productivity was slow, and the creative talents of the working people often did not receive the attention they deserved. The system and content of modern geological science in China were mainly introduced from foreign countries. Before liberation, although many geologists either hoped to develop resources for the motherland or wanted to combine with Chinese geological characteristics to make contributions to the creation and development of Chinese geological science, imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism stifled this hope. From 1912, when China began to run its own geological undertakings, to 1949, the development of geological science in China was extremely slow. Of course, during this period, thanks to the efforts of some geologists, certain contributions were made in stratigraphy, paleontology, geomechanics, paleoanthropology, and geological tectonics. However, under the social conditions at that time, they failed to get rid of the influence of the bourgeois worldview and therefore generally showed detachment from production reality. A few people who were seriously influenced by imperialism became echoes of imperialism and spread the fallacies that "China is poor in minerals" and "China is large but not rich in resources." For example, an article published in the third issue of the first volume of the *Peiyang Engineering Quarterly* in 1933 wrote: "In the past two decades, those who have criticized China's mineral resources are all Chinese and foreign geologists and mining engineers. Therefore, it is obvious to the world that our country has no large amount of mineral resources. This has scientific basis and field investigation, and is by no means fabricated." Here, "science" became a tool to undermine the self-confidence of the Chinese people.

After the nationwide liberation, under the wise and correct leadership of the Party, the development of geological science gained extremely favorable conditions. In the eleven years since the founding of the country, geological work has achieved tremendous results. Especially under the brilliant light of the three red flags of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, a magnificent mass movement of the whole Party and the whole people engaged in geology has been carried out nationwide since 1958. The development of geological work has been rapid, and mineral bases are discovered every day. These new achievements have completely shattered the distortion and propaganda of imperialist elements and their followers regarding China's mineral poverty. On the other hand, the continuous development of production has also put forward new tasks for geological science, prompting all aspects of geological science to be unprecedentedly developed. For example, there have been some new discoveries and creations in the formation laws of minerals such as iron, copper, and tin, the influence of geotectonics on mineral generation, and mineral prediction. Many new departments in geological science, such as hydrogeology, engineering geology, geochemistry, exploration engineering, and geophysical prospecting, have also developed vigorously. What is particularly important is that the geological team has grown unprecedentedly. On the one hand, in the mass movement of the whole Party and the whole people engaging in geology, the broad masses of working people have begun to master modern geological science. On the other hand, the number of geological professionals has also increased rapidly. Beijing Geological College alone has provided the country with geological cadres in the past few years, which is more than twenty times the total number of geological talents trained in old China for decades. Even so, it is far from meeting the needs of the Great Leap Forward.

In order to realize the modernization of industry, agriculture, science, and culture, we need more and more varieties and quantities of mineral products. The development of modern science and technology such as atomic energy, semiconductors, rockets, and radio electronics, and the creation of highly precise and heavy machinery require raw materials with various special properties, which are mainly obtained from underground.

Under the situation of rapidly developing agriculture, there is also an urgent need to find abundant groundwater and a large amount of fertilizer raw materials such as phosphate rock, potash salt, and peat.

We need to discover and identify more minerals at high speed. The gradual implementation of many unprecedented grand plans for transforming nature has also put forward a series of new issues for geological science.

It can be seen that China's geological science can only continue to advance to meet the requirements of socialist construction, and the current situation urgently requires it to leap forward to a new stage.

From the perspective of the development of geological science itself, it must also leap forward, and it is able to leap forward. Geological science is the law summarized by mankind from the actual materials obtained from the Earth's surface and its depths. Chairman Mao pointed out: "Marxists believe that human social production activities are developed step by step from lower to higher levels. Therefore, people's understanding, whether in terms of the natural world or the social world, is also developed step by step from lower to higher levels." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume 1, p. 272) Therefore, the development of each science always goes through a stage of accumulating a large amount of factual material. Perhaps because the Earth's volume is particularly large and the phenomena are very complex, and from the perspective of human time, many geological changes are too slow and difficult to detect, the accumulation of materials has become a focus in the approximately two hundred years since geology began to appear. As Engels said: The first period of the emerging natural sciences was a period of mastering the existing materials. It had already made great achievements in the fields of mathematics, mechanics and astronomy, statics and dynamics, while geology and paleontology did not exist at that time. (See *Dialectics of Nature*, p. 159) In the content of geology, it is manifested by more description, less theory, more assumptions, and fewer laws. According to the inspection of the lecture notes of the nine major geological courses of Beijing Geological College, the description of minerals, rocks, mineral deposits, paleontological fossils, geological structural forms, etc., occupies most of the space.

The accumulation of factual data is very important, and it must continue to be accumulated in the future. After liberation, due to the unprecedented development of the geological production profession, extremely rich data were provided. Drilling work is an important means of revealing underground conditions, and the amount of work completed can reflect the degree of mastery of underground data. The amount of work completed in the ten years after liberation has exceeded 150 times the amount completed in the decades before liberation. In addition, we have also obtained a large amount of geophysical prospecting data.

However, just describing, only having perceptual materials, is incomplete and does not reflect the essence of things. Based on the new and large amount of practical data, under the new situation, China's geology should and can rapidly improve its theoretical level and change the face of geological science, so as to more effectively promote production practice. It cannot be said that geology in the past did not elevate factual materials to theory, but the degree of understanding was not deep enough. In general, the external characteristics of things are studied more. One of the reasons is that the latest achievements in physics, chemistry, mechanics, etc. have not been fully and timely utilized, and the forms of movement of the Earth have not been explored in depth.

Now, the level of science and technology has developed to the point where, on the one hand, it can deeply understand the internal conditions of the atomic nucleus, and on the other hand, it can directly collect scientific data from interstellar space. The understanding of the essence of the Earth may also be more profound and comprehensive than in the past. From the perspective of ideological conditions, today our geological workers have initially transformed their thinking under the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao, and are launching a upsurge in studying the works of Chairman Mao. This is even more of a decisive and favorable condition for the development of China's geological science.

Based on these situations, we put forward the following opinions on how to develop geological science in the future for comrades to refer to.

Develop Comprehensive Research and Marginal Sciences

First, in current geology, the phenomenon of studying the external characteristics of things in isolation is very serious, and these external characteristics are often regarded as universal laws. This is not in line with objective reality. For example, in the study of mineral deposits, in the past, most people only paid attention to the study of individual ore bodies themselves, lacking the study of connecting ore bodies with the surrounding substances, and even more lacking the study of a group of ore bodies as a whole. When studying the laws of mineral generation, many places have not deeply elucidated the essence of things, which will inevitably lead to places that do not conform to objective reality. The theories themselves often contradict each other, or they do not grasp the main contradictions of geological changes, put the cart before the horse, and draw conclusions that do not conform to the facts. For example, attention is paid to the external factor of the temperature of mineral generation, and the more essential problems are ignored. Moreover, due to the limitations of materials and the one-sidedness of thinking, long-term disputes are often caused by the minerals formed at different temperatures existing in the same mineral deposit. For example, some paleozoologists once determined that a certain stratum should belong to a certain era based on the data of animal fossils, while paleobotanists put forward different opinions based on the data of plant fossils. Therefore, to make geological science leap to a new level, it is necessary to deeply understand the essence of things and "grasp the development of the surrounding world in the whole of the surrounding world and in the internal connections of all aspects of the surrounding world." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, p. 275) The embodiment of this idea in geology should be to vigorously develop comprehensive research and marginal sciences, and at the same time, be good at grasping the main contradictions and deeply exploring key issues. We should study related sciences or different aspects of the same specific location or specific problem as a whole, and should not make the relevant sciences have strict barriers and no contact with each other. When studying, we should not only use the existing set of geological methods, but also widely and timely apply the latest achievements in physics, chemistry, radio, mechanics, and other aspects. We should not only study the "individuals" of mineral deposits, minerals, and metallogenic elements, but also study their "groups" so that we can get conclusions that are closer to objective laws.

Strengthening comprehensive research also requires strengthening the in-depth understanding of individual things. To deeply explore the laws of geology, we must apply modern scientific and technological achievements, which leads to the combination of geology with physics, chemistry, mechanics, biology, and other disciplines. Physics and chemistry are both studying the laws of motion of matter, but the crust as a whole shows great particularity as a kind of matter. The usual physical and chemical laws often cannot fully explain the laws of development and change of the crust, so the development of geophysics, geochemistry, and other marginal sciences is very necessary. As the understanding deepens, comprehensive research is also needed. For example, the occurrence of fractures or bends in the crust looks like a mechanical deformation of physical phenomena, but complex chemical changes occur simultaneously in its development process. This requires the relevant disciplines to study the Earth from a unified point of view.

Although marginal sciences have developed to some extent in the field of geology in recent years, the proportion is not large. We should consciously promote the combination of these disciplines under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. This is an important direction for the development of geology.

Combining the Study of China's Special Laws with the Study of the World's General Laws

Second, to develop geological science, we must pay attention to both the study of its generality and its particularity. The Earth is not a uniform object, and the particularities shown in different regions are quite clear. Especially China has a vast territory and many mountains, and its geological history has been frequently changed, with great particularity. For example, in terms of structural movement, which is extremely important for influencing the development of the crust, it shows special activity in China, which directly affects the laws of mineral formation in China. However, in the past, there were often situations where foreign theories were used to generalize Chinese geological phenomena. The actual data of these foreign theories came from Western Europe and North America, and they were not universal laws. If they were applied to China, wrong conclusions would inevitably be produced. Many absurd statements about China's mineral poverty also originated from this. Foreign countries have fewer continental facies sediments, and they rarely see the generation of petroleum, potash salt, etc. in continental facies sediments, so they came to a negative conclusion. Some people echoed it, but in fact, they did not study our own geological characteristics enough. In the past, it was rare to put forward Chinese geological theories from the characteristics of China. Therefore, strengthening the study of the particularities of the geological laws of the motherland is not only an important direction for improving the level of China's geological science, but also will make a major contribution to the world's scientific treasure house and promote the development of the entire geology.

It is important to study the particularity of Chinese geology, but in order to make our understanding closer to the truth, it is also important to study the generality of the geological conditions of the entire Earth. Only in this way can we get a more correct understanding of China's geological laws. Not much research has been done in this area, and it needs to be developed in the future.

Develop Experimental Geology

Third, experiments are very important for the development of science, but this is a weak link in geology. For many years, the research methods of geology have been considered to be mainly observation, induction, and inference, and experiments have been placed in an unimportant position. This is certainly because many geological changes are carried out under ultra-high temperature, ultra-high pressure, and complex natural conditions over a long period of time, but often because of the overemphasis on the inability to reproduce in experiments, many theories in geology have not been verified, and there has been no conscious effort to work in this direction. At present, due to the improvement of technical levels such as ultra-high temperature and ultra-high pressure, it is possible to carry out several experiments simulating geological processes, and in the future, this work needs to be further strengthened, otherwise many theories of geology will still not be able to be based on the solid foundation of verification, and it will be difficult to develop further.

The development of experimental geology is not only to simulate natural phenomena and help people understand nature, but also will enable us to transform nature more powerfully. Let's imagine:

If we can have a clearer grasp of the laws of dispersion and concentration of elements in the Earth's crust and the laws of mineral formation, can we use the changes of nature itself to promote its development in a direction that is beneficial to us, such as making certain useful elements enrich in the Earth's crust and realize the ideal of artificial ore making.

If we deeply master the laws of activities such as volcanoes and earthquakes, can we not only prevent their harm, but also control and utilize their huge energy.

These ideas are all possible to realize, and the establishment and development of experimental geology is an important key for geology to leap forward.

Strengthen the Research on Mineral Exploration Theory and Methods

Fourth, the rapid development of production has created favorable conditions for the development of geology, and the various research objectives of geology must also be to discover and identify mineral deposits and change nature quickly, well, and economically, which in turn promotes the high-speed development of geological work. Therefore, in addition to the exploration of basic geological theories, research must also be carried out in the theory and methods of mineral exploration.

Under the guidance of the Party's general line for building socialism and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, China's mineral exploration work is creating new high-speed experiences, and summarizing and promoting these theories will greatly promote the development of geological work.

The tools used in geological work have long been quite backward in many aspects, such as identifying ores with the naked eye. In geological exploration, technical innovation and technical revolution have been put on the current important agenda. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement carried out this year has achieved tremendous results.

The high-speed development of production and the reform of tools are the basis for scientific development. Today's geology is facing such a great situation. As long as geology is closely combined with the current production, the current technical innovation, and the technical revolution movement, it is possible to continue to leap forward.

In the cause of developing geological science, our universities and colleges are an army, shouldering important tasks. Judging from the situation of Beijing Geological College, scientific research can be closely combined with teaching and production, that is, through scientific research, the teaching tasks are completed and the key problems encountered in production are solved. Because the above directions have been implemented in the practice of scientific research, the scientific level and teaching level have been improved. For example, in the compilation process of the "Geotectonic Map of China and Mineral Prediction Map," teachers and students began to use comprehensive research methods and put forward creative insights, pointing out the direction for production. At the same time, they completed the course "Regional Geology and Geotectonics." At present, we are also carrying out research on rapid exploration in combination with the teaching of "Mineral Exploration Geology." As long as we can resolutely implement the Party's education policy, hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, continuously carry out ideological revolution, adhere to the Party's leadership and the mass line of scientific research work, and launch mass movements on a large scale, we will surely be able to rapidly climb to the world peak in the research of geological science.

    大力发展我国地质科学
    北京地质学院副院长　萧英
    地球是人类活动的场所。人类对地球的科学认识开始很早，但只是在近代工业生产力提高以后，地质学才逐渐发展成为一门独立的科学，到现在不过二百年左右的历史。地质学来源于生产实践，因之地质学在一个国家中发展的快慢往往反映出生产力的高低。
    我国劳动人民在采掘矿产、开凿河渠、利用地下水以及对地震、洪水等自然灾害作斗争等方面，从很早起就累积了丰富的经验。我国是世界上最早用煤的国家；在秦以前就已开凿了四川的盐井。我国古代劳动人民在兴修水利方面的成就更是出色，战国时兴修的郑国渠不仅便于灌溉，而且成功地疏导了地下水，改良了盐碱地。至于历代劳动人民找到的大小矿藏更是不胜枚举。
    由于我国长期停滞在封建社会阶段，生产力发展缓慢，劳动人民的天才创造往往得不到应有的重视。我国近代地质科学的体系、内容，主要是从外国传入的。解放前尽管有不少地质学家或者希望为祖国开发资源，或者想结合中国地质特点，为创立和发展中国的地质科学作一番工作，但是帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义扼杀了这种希望。从1912年我国开始自办地质事业到1949年三十多年间，地质科学在我国的发展异常缓慢。当然，在此期间，由于一些地质学家的努力，在地层学、古生物学、地质力学、古人类学、地质构造学等方面都有过一定的贡献。只是在当时的社会条件之下，他们未能摆脱资产阶级世界观的影响，因而普遍地表现脱离生产实际。少数受帝国主义影响严重的人成了帝国主义的应声虫，大肆散布“中国矿产贫乏”、“中国地大而物不博”的谬论。如1933年出版的《北洋理工季刊》第一卷第三期上的一篇文章便这样写道：“近二十年来，批评中国矿产者，均属中外地质学家、矿师，于是我国实无巨量矿产昭昭于世矣，此有科学根据，实地调查，绝非信口虚构。”在这里，“科学”成了瓦解我国人民自信心的工具。
    全国解放了，在党的英明而正确的领导下，地质科学的发展获得了极为有利的条件。建国十一年来地质工作取得了巨大的成果，尤其是在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀下，从1958年以来在全国范围内开展了波澜壮阔的全党全民办地质的群众运动，地质工作的发展更是一日千里，矿产基地更是日有发现。以上的新成就彻底粉碎了帝国主义分子及其附和者关于中国矿产贫乏的歪曲宣传。另一方面，在生产不断发展的形势下也向地质科学提出了新的任务，促使地质科学的各个方面都得到了空前的发展。如对铁、铜、锡等矿产的形成规律，大地构造对矿产生成的影响及矿产预测等方面的理论和方法，都有了一些新的发现和创造。许多地质科学中新的部门如水文地质学、工程地质学、地球化学、探矿工程、地球物理勘探等也都蓬勃地发展起来了。特别重要的是地质队伍空前地壮大了，一方面在全党全民办地质的运动中，广大劳动人民开始掌握了近代地质科学，另一方面地质专业人员的人数也有了飞速的增长，仅北京地质学院一个学校，几年来为国家输送的地质干部就相当旧中国数十年所培养的地质人材总数的二十多倍。就是这样也还远远不能适应大跃进的需要。
    为了实现工业、农业和科学文化的现代化，我们需要的矿产品种越来越多，数量越来越大。原子能、半导体、火箭、无线电电子学等近代科学技术的发展，高度精密和重型机械的创造，需要具有各种特殊性能的原料材料，这些东西主要都取自地下。
    在迅速发展农业的形势下，也就迫切需要找到丰富的地下水和大量磷矿、钾盐矿、泥炭等化肥原料。
    我们需要高速度地发现和查明更多的矿产。由于许多空前未有的改造自然的宏伟计划的逐步实施，也给地质科学提出一系列新问题。
    由此可见，我国的地质科学只有不断前进，才能适应社会主义建设的要求，而当前的形势更迫切要求它向一个新的阶段跃进。
    从地质科学本身的发展来看，也必须跃进，并且能够跃进。地质科学是人类从地球表面和它的深处得到的实际材料总结出来的规律。毛主席指出：“马克思主义者认为人类社会的生产活动，是一步又一步地由低级向高级发展，因此，人们的认识，不论对于自然界方面，对于社会方面，也都是一步又一步地由低级向高级发展。”（《毛泽东选集》第一卷第272页）因此每门科学的发展总是要经过一个大量积累事实材料的阶段。也许由于地球体积特别庞大，现象非常复杂，从人类的时间观念来看，许多地质变化又太缓慢，不易察觉，地质学在开始出现至今的大约二百年间，积累材料成为一个重点。正如恩格斯所说：新兴自然科学的第一个时期，这是一个掌握已有材料的时期，它在数学、力学和天文学、静力学和动力学的领域中已经有了伟大的成就，而地质学和古生物学当时还不存在。（见《自然辩证法》159页）在地质学的内容中表现为描述较多，理论少，假设多，定律少。据对北京地质学院九门主要地质课程讲义的检查，对矿物、岩石、矿床、古生物化石、地质构造形态等的描述，占据了大部分篇幅。
    事实资料的积累是非常重要的，今后还要继续积累。解放后由于地质生产专业的空前发展，提供的资料极为丰富。钻探工作是揭露地下情况的重要手段，完成的工作量的多少，可以反映对地下资料的掌握程度。解放后十年中所完成的工作量，已超过了解放前几十年所完成的一百五十倍。此外，我们还得到了大量的地球物理探矿资料。
    但是只是描述，只有感性材料，这是不完全的，是没有反映事物本质的。在新的大量的实际资料的基础上，在新的形势下，我国的地质学应该也有可能迅速提高理论水平，改变地质科学的面貌，从而更加有效地促进生产实践。不能说过去的地质学没有把事实材料上升成为理论，但是就其认识的深刻程度来说还很不够。一般情况是事物的外部特征研究得较多。其原因之一是没有充分而及时地利用物理、化学、力学等方面的最新成就，没有深入探讨地球的运动形式。
    现在，科学技术水平发展到一方面能够深入了解原子核的内部情况，一方面又能够直接收集星际间的科学资料，对地球本质的认识也有可能比过去更深刻、更全面。从思想条件来看，今天我们的地质工作者在党和毛主席的教导下，初步改造了思想，并且正在掀起学习毛主席著作的热潮。这更是发展我国地质科学具有决定意义的有利条件。
    根据这些情况我们对目前地质科学如何向前发展提出下列意见，供同志们参考。
    发展综合研究与边缘科学
    第一、在现在的地质学中，孤立地对事物的外部特征进行研究的现象很严重，而且往往把这些外部特征当作普遍规律。这是不符合客观实际的。如对于矿床的研究，过去大多只注意单个矿体本身的研究，缺乏将矿体与周围的物质联系起来研究，更缺乏将一组一群矿体作为一个总体来研究。在研究矿产的生成规律时，许多地方并没有深入阐明事物的本质，这就必然会有不符合客观实际的地方。理论本身也常常自相抵触，或是没有抓住地质变化的主要矛盾，本末倒置，得出不合事实的结论。例如注意了矿产生成的温度这一外界因素，忽略了更本质的问题，并且由于材料的限制和思想的片面性，对在同一矿床中存在的不同温度下形成的矿物常常引起长期的争论。又如曾有古动物学家根据动物化石的资料断定某一地层应属某个时代，而古植物学家又根据植物化石的资料，提出了不同的意见。因此要使地质科学跃进到新的水平，就必须深入事物的本质，“在周围世界的总体上，在周围世界一切方面的内部联系上去把握周围世界的发展。”（《毛泽东选集》275页）这个思想在地质学中的体现，应当是大力发展综合研究与边缘科学，同时要善于抓住主要矛盾，深入重点问题。我们应当把相关的科学或同一具体地点或具体问题的不同方面，作为一个整体来研究，而不应使各有关科学之间壁垒森严，互不联系。在研究的时候还应不只是使用现有的地质学一套方法，而要广泛及时地应用物理、化学、无线电、力学等方面的最新成就。我们应当不只是研究矿床、矿物以及成矿元素等等的“个体”，而且要研究它们的“群体”，这样才能得到比较接近于客观规律的结论。
    加强综合研究，同时需要加强对个别事物的深入认识，而要深入探讨地质学的规律，必须应用近代科学技术成果，这就导致了地质学与物理学、化学、力学、生物学等等学科的结合。物理、化学都是研究物质运动规律的，但地壳整体作为一种物质来看则表现了很大的特殊性。通常的物理化学规律还往往不能充分解释地壳的发展变化规律，所以就非常需要地球物理学、地球化学等边缘科学的发展，随着认识的深入，也还需要全面综合性的研究。譬如地壳发生断裂或弯曲，看起来是一种机械变形的物理现象，但在它的发展过程中同时有着复杂的化学变化。这就需要各有关学科从统一的观点来研究地球。
    虽然近年来在地质学范围内边缘科学已有所发展，但所占的比重还不大，我们应该在毛泽东思想的指导下，有意识地去促进这种学科间的结合。这是发展地质学的一个重要方向。
    研究中国的特殊规律与研究世界的一般规律相结合
    第二、要发展地质科学就必须既注意研究其一般性，又注意其特殊性。地球并不是一个均一的物体，不同地区表现的特殊性是相当清楚的。尤其是我国地大山多，在地质历史上变动频繁，具有很大的特殊性。譬如就影响地壳发展极为重要的构造运动来说，在我国就表现出特殊的活动性，直接影响到我国矿产等形成的规律。但是在过去常有以外国理论来概括我国地质现象的情况，这些外国理论的实际资料来自西欧北美，并非普遍规律，搬来我国应用，势必产生错误的结论。许多关于我国矿产贫乏的荒谬说法，一部分也由此而生。外国的陆相沉积少，他们很少看到陆相沉积中有生成石油、钾盐等情况，就下了否定的结论。有的人随声附和，其实是对我们自己的地质特点研究不够。从中国特点出发提出中国的地质理论，在过去是很少的。因此加强对祖国地质规律的特殊性的研究，不仅是提高我国地质科学水平的重要方向，而且也必将对世界科学宝库作出重大贡献，推动整个地质学的发展。
  研究中国地质的特殊性是重要的，但为了使我们的认识更进一步地接近真理，研究整个地球地质情况的一般性也是重要的。只有这样才能对我国的地质规律得到更正确的认识。这方面的研究目前还作得不多，今后需要发展。
    发展实验地质学
    第三、实验对科学的发展是非常重要的，但这在地质学中是个薄弱的环节。多少年来地质学研究方法被认为主要是观察、归纳、推论，实验被摆在不重要的地位。这固然是因为许多地质变动是在超高温、超高压和复杂的自然条件下经过漫长的时间进行的，但是常因过分强调无法在实验中再现，因而地质学中许多理论都还没有经过验证，而且也没有有意识地来向这方面努力。目前由于超高温超高压等技术水平的提高，进行若干模拟地质作用的实验是有可能的，而在今后，这方面的工作还需要更大的加强，否则地质学的许多理论仍然不能建立在经过验证的坚实的基础上，也就很难进一步发展。
    实验地质学的发展，不仅是模拟自然现象，帮助人们认识自然，而且还将使我们更有力地改造自然。不妨设想：
    如果我们能够比较清楚地掌握元素在地壳中分散与集中的规律，掌握矿产形成的规律，我们是否可以利用自然本身的变化，促使其向对我们有利的方向发展，譬如使某些有用元素在地壳中富集起来，实现人工造矿的理想。
    如果我们深刻地掌握了火山、地震等活动的规律，我们是否可以不仅能防止它们的危害，而且能够控制利用它们的巨大能量。
    这些想法都是有可能实现的，实验地质学的建立和发展，是地质学向前跃进的一个重要关键。
    加强找矿勘探理论与方法的研究
    第四、生产的飞跃发展，给地质学的发展创造了有利的条件，而地质学的种种研究目的也必须是为了多快好省地发现查明矿藏和改变自然，这又推动地质工作高速度发展。因此除了地质基本理论的探讨外，在找矿勘探的理论与方法方面也必须开展研究。
    在党的建设社会主义总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针指导下，我国的找矿勘探工作正在创造出新的高速度的经验，总结推广这些理论，就将大大促进地质工作的发展。
    地质工作中所使用的工具，长期以来在许多方面表现得相当落后，如用肉眼鉴别矿石等。在地质勘探方面，技术革新和技术革命已提到当前重要的日程上来。今年开展的技术革新和技术革命运动，已取得巨大的成果。
    生产的高速度发展，工具的改革，这是科学发展的基础。今天的地质学正面临着这样的一个大好形势，只要地质学与当前的生产、当前的技术革新和技术革命运动密切结合起来，就有可能不断跃进。
    在发展地质科学的事业中，我们高等学校是一个方面军，肩负着重要的任务。从北京地质学院的情况看来，科学研究完全可以与教学、生产紧密结合起来，即通过科学研究，既完成了教学任务，又解决了生产中所遇到的关键问题。由于在科学研究的实践中贯彻了以上方向，因而提高了科学水平与教学水平，如在《中国大地构造及成矿预测图》的编制过程中，师生开始运用了综合研究的方法，提出了具有创造性的见解，给生产指出了方向。与此同时又学完了《区域地质及大地构造学》这门课程。目前我们还在结合《找矿勘探地质学》的教学展开快速勘探的研究。只要我们能坚决贯彻党的教育方针，高举毛泽东思想红旗，不断进行思想革命，坚持党的领导和科学研究工作的群众路线，大搞群众运动，就一定能使我们在地质科学的研究上迅速登上世界高峰。
