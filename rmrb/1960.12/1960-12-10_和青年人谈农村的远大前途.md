Talking to Young People About the Broad Prospects of the Countryside
Gan Zuchang

Editor's Note: Comrade Gan Zuchang was a Major General in the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and before returning to his hometown, he served as the Director of the Logistics Department of the Xinjiang Military Region. He fought for the revolutionary cause of the Party and the people for more than thirty years, and suffered several head injuries, resulting in severe damage to his brain, making it impossible for him to continue working. In 1957, he resolutely gave up his convalescent life and resolutely returned to the countryside to participate in agricultural production.

I returned to my hometown in July 1957 to participate in agricultural production. Three days after I got home, I went to collect wild manure. At that time, some people started to talk about it: "He doesn't want to be an 'official,' but he comes to the countryside to bask in the hot sun and suffer." Indeed, at that time, some young people in the countryside thought that agricultural production was hard, that the countryside had no future, and that it was better to go to the city.

Is the countryside really hard? We should look at the problem from two aspects: on the one hand, we must see that in the eleven years since the founding of our country, productivity has greatly improved, and life has greatly improved. Taking what I have seen and heard in my hometown in the past three years as an example: Lianhua County could not even talk about any industry in the past, but now the daily output of pig iron is maintained at 50 tons; there are machinery factories, dozens of cars and tractors; and highways extend in all directions. In terms of agricultural production, there were only 160,000 mu of rice paddies in the past, but now there are 200,000 mu, and the output has also increased significantly. The development of culture, education and health is also very large. In the past, there were only three dilapidated middle schools with only more than 100 students, but now there are four middle schools, one normal school, and one health school, with more than 1,800 students; there were only a dozen medical personnel in the past, but now there are more than 160. In the past, our working people were dressed in rags, but now every member of the commune is dressed neatly, and the women are also dressed in bright colors; most people have shed their illiterate hats, and young people have attended amateur agricultural middle schools and Red and Expert schools; the commune has holidays, and production labor is also a combination of work and rest on weekdays. Compared with before liberation, it is really a world of difference. In the future, with the implementation of the policy of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, agricultural production will become more and more developed, and rural life will become more and more happy. From another point of view, although rural life has greatly improved since liberation, due to the dilapidated situation left by the Kuomintang reactionaries, the foundation is very weak. Therefore, the vast number of commune members in the countryside cannot completely get rid of this poverty-stricken situation.

No matter what rural life is like now, if we compare the current life with the arduous life during the revolutionary struggle in the past, then our current life is really too happy. During the Red Army revolution, taking Jinggangshan as an example, under the condition that the enemy was strong and we were weak, the enemy implemented an economic blockade, and many things could not be transported in. What we ate was red rice, pumpkin, and dried bamboo shoots. When the Red Army went north to resist Japan, they were sometimes surrounded by the enemy, starved for several days, held their positions, and fought with the enemy. When crossing the snow-capped mountains and grasslands, when the dry food was finished, they mixed cowhide, bamboo hats, and straw sandals with wild grass and boiled them to eat. When the leather and wild grass were eaten up, they continued to march on empty stomachs.

However, some young people today do not know this. They say: "Sing the song of the mountain you stand on," as if to say: "Now it is a socialist society, why must we compare it with the living conditions when the Red Army went north?" Yes, now that we have seized power, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the socialist construction of our country is advancing rapidly. The current living conditions are a million times better than those when the Red Army went north. However, we are still "poor and blank." What we are doing now is still far from our great ideals of building socialism and communism. Therefore, each of us should learn from the hardworking and simple lifestyle of the Red Army when it went north when dealing with our own lives. We must do everything possible to accelerate national construction. Only when the country is built more prosperous can our happy and beautiful life have a solid material foundation.

Everyone yearns for a beautiful and happy life, and the purpose of our revolution is to continuously and to the greatest extent meet the needs of people's material and cultural life. But we must never understand the problem of life vulgarly, and base our ideals of life only on the basis of seeking enjoyment. As soon as we talk about life, we haggle over personal living standards. For example, some people say that urban life is good, and they only mean upstairs and downstairs with electric lights and telephones. In the few months since I returned to my hometown, I have seen that some young men and women want to go to the city, to go to the factory, and are unwilling to stay in the countryside. They are not at ease with agricultural production and think that the countryside has no future. These are mainly due to a lack of correct understanding of life.

Does the countryside really have no future? No, in revolutionary work, any place has a future, but it depends on how you view the future. Take myself as an example. I have worked for the revolution for more than 30 years. Under the cultivation and education of the Party, I have been able to take some responsibility for the Party's work. However, I suffer from post-concussion syndrome, and my brain is not very good. I think I cannot engage in mental work, but in terms of physical labor, I want to do more beneficial work for the Party. Therefore, I made up my mind to ask to participate in physical labor, which is my best future. However, there are also some other people who think that I have suffered a bit for the revolution in the past and advocate that I take a long-term rest, as if this is my only future. Indeed, the issue of the future also reflects two worldviews, one is the individualistic worldview, which is for personal enjoyment; the other is the proletarian worldview, which is to fight to the end for the collective interest and for the cause of communism.

If we have a correct worldview, then when we produce in the countryside, we will realize that the future of the countryside is very broad. In particular, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have put forward the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and vigorously developing agriculture and grain production. Anyone who is willing to contribute to socialist construction and to the ideal of communism, the countryside is precisely the place for them to show their talents and make great achievements. How can it have no future!

In the three years since I returned to my hometown, I feel that I have not made any outstanding achievements, but I have profound experiences.

In 1958, after the Party put forward the instruction of "marching towards barren mountains and asking for grain from red soil," I chose to reclaim wasteland on Tiger Shape Mountain, which is about 200 meters away from my home. This place is full of thorns, which pierced my hands. I put tape on them. The thorns pierced my clothes, so I sewed them up. In the past three years, I have dug out more than 500 loads of firewood and killed more than 100 poisonous snakes. Later, I reclaimed wasteland on red soil. Passers-by saw it and said to me: "Uncle Zuchang, I don't understand fighting, but I am better than you at production. This soil cannot produce anything, and it is a waste of effort to cultivate it." At this time, I remembered that when the Red Army passed through Yunnan, they saw that red soil could also grow pumpkins, which grew very well, and the melons were large and plentiful. Could it be that the red soil here cannot grow anything? I was especially energetic in reclaiming red soil, and I kept digging more than a foot deep into the subsoil. Ten hoes broke, and finally I planted various crops. In 1958 alone, I harvested more than 300 kilograms of pumpkins and beans, and more than 500 kilograms of sweet potatoes.

After three years of hard work, I have reclaimed more than four mu of wasteland on Tiger Shape Mountain, planted more than 360 fruit trees, and harvested more than 5,000 kilograms of pumpkins and other crops, and more than 2,000 kilograms of sweet potatoes. My family of 23 people has achieved self-sufficiency and surplus in vegetables and miscellaneous grains. Some elderly people in the team said: "Red soil produces such good things. This is Gan Zuchang's 'great fate.'" But those young people retorted: "What great fate, small fate, this is because he has endured hardship, dug deep into the subsoil, and managed it well, so he can grow such good things." The masses have eliminated the idea that red soil cannot produce good things. This year, the county party committee instructed to reclaim large tracts of wasteland and grow vegetables. At present, the commune members are consciously going to the red soil of Tiger Shape Mountain to reclaim wasteland, at least reclaiming more than 100 mu. Some have already planted winter crops such as broad beans, peas, and vegetables.

If we want to greatly develop agriculture and increase grain production, we must fully tap the potential and turn low-yield fields into high-yield fields. The Yanbei Brigade in my hometown has more than 600 mu of low-yield rice paddies, accounting for one-third of the total area. If these fields are transformed and catch up with the high-yield fields, how great would the benefits be to the country and the people! Therefore, in 1958, I put forward a plan to transform winter paddy fields. Not many people agreed this year, and only more than 20 mu of winter paddy fields were transformed in the seventh team. As a result, the output increased by one time. In 1959, more commune members agreed to transform winter paddy fields. A total of 224 mu of winter paddy fields were transformed in the entire brigade. These fields also increased their output several times compared with previous years. Among them, there was one plot of 2.33 mu, which I transformed with my own hands. In the past, it only yielded 420 kilograms in general years, but in 1960, the actual yield of dry rice was more than 910 kilograms. Now, the commune members of the entire brigade are determined to gradually transform the remaining 400 mu of winter paddy fields. As the commune members reflected: "Winter paddy fields, in the past, water was used to survive the winter, but now green manure is used to survive the winter. How can there be no increase in production!"

Above, I have only talked about my own experiences. Young comrades, there are many things to do in the countryside. If you have a correct understanding of the future, when you achieve a small achievement in production or work, you will feel that participating in production and work in the countryside can also make a significant contribution to the cause of the Party. You will consciously feel that the future of the countryside is broad, and the countryside is promising. (Attached picture)

    和青年人谈农村的远大前途
    甘祖昌
    编者按：甘祖昌同志是中国人民解放军少将，回乡前担任新疆军区后勤部部长。他为党和人民的革命事业，南征北战三十多年，头部数次负伤，因脑子受到严重损害不能坚持工作。1957年，他毅然放弃了疗养生活，坚决地回到农村参加农业生产劳动。
    我是1957年7月回乡参加农业生产的，到家后三天就去捡野粪。当时有些人就议论开了：“有‘官’不去做，却到农村来晒黄日头，吃苦”。的确，当时农村有一部分青年认为农业生产苦，农村没有前途，不如到城市去。
    农村是不是苦呢？我们应该从两个方面去看问题：一方面要看到我国解放十一年来，生产力有了很大提高，生活大有改善。就以我回乡三年所见所闻来说：莲花县过去根本谈不上什么工业，现在生铁日产量保持五十吨；有机械厂，有几十辆汽车和拖拉机；公路四通八达。在农业生产方面，过去只有十六万亩水稻田，现在有二十万亩，产量也是大幅度的增加。文教卫生方面，也同样增长很大，过去只有三个破烂的中学，学生只一百多人，现在有四个中学，一所师范，一所卫生学校，有学生一千八百多人；医务人员过去只有十几人，现在有一百六十多人。过去我们劳动人民穿得破破烂烂的，可是现在那一个社员都穿得整整齐齐，妇女还穿得红红花花；大部分人摘了文盲帽子，年青人上了业余的农业中学、红专学校；公社里有了假日，平日生产劳动也是有劳有逸。这和解放前来对比，真是天地之别。今后随着大办农业、大办粮食方针的贯彻，农业生产越来越发展，农村生活也越来越幸福。再从另外一个方面来看，虽然解放后农村生活大有提高，但是由于国民党反动派遗留下来这个破烂的摊子，家底子很薄弱，因此，现在广大农村的社员还不能彻底摆脱这个穷困的处境。
    不管现在农村生活怎样，如果要把现在的生活与过去革命斗争时那种艰苦生活来对比，那么我们现在的生活真是太幸福了。在红军革命时，就以当时在井冈山来说，在敌强我弱的情况下，敌人实行了经济封锁，许多东西运不进来，我们吃的就是红米、南瓜加干笋。红军北上抗日时，有时被敌人包围了，几天饿着肚子，坚守阵地，和敌人战斗。在过雪山、草地时，干粮吃完了，便把牛皮、斗笠、草鞋拌野草煮着吃，皮质、野草吃光了，就饿着肚子坚持行军。
    但是，今天有些青年人不知道这一点，他们说：站在什么山上，唱什么歌，好像说：“现在是社会主义社会，为什么一定要拿红军北上那时的生活条件来对比呢？”对，现在我们掌握了政权，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，我们国家的社会主义建设正在一日千里的前进，现在的生活条件比红军北上那时的生活条件好上千万倍了。但是，我们还“一穷二白”，我们现在所做的，距离我们建成社会主义和共产主义的伟大理想还很远。因此，我们每一个人在处理自己的生活的态度上，应该学习红军北上那时的艰苦朴素的生活作风，我们要千方百计地加速国家建设，国家建设得更富强，我们幸福美好的生活才有雄厚的物质基础。
    每一个人都向往美好幸福的生活，我们革命的目的也是不断地和最大限度地满足人们物质文化生活的需要。但是我们决不应该把生活问题作庸俗的理解，把对生活的理想只建立在图享受的基础上，一谈到生活，就斤斤计较个人的生活待遇。比如，有的人说城市生活好，就只是楼上楼下电灯电话。在我回乡的几个月里，看到某些男女青年要进城市，要进工厂，不愿在农村，不安心农业生产，认为农村没有前途等等错误认识，主要都是由于对生活缺乏正确的理解。
    农村真的没有前途吗？不，干革命工作，任何地方都是有前途的，不过看你对前途怎样看法。就以我来说吧，为革命干了三十几年，在党的培养教育下，使我能为党负责一点工作，可是我患脑震荡后遗症病，脑子不大好使用，我认为我不能从事脑力劳动，但在体力劳动方面，要为党做出更多的有益的工作。因此，我下决心要求参加体力劳动，这才是我最好的前途。但是，也还有另外一些人，认为我过去为革命吃了点苦，主张我长期休养，好像这就是我的唯一的前途。的确前途问题也反映两种世界观，一种是个人主义世界观，那就是为个人享受；另一种是无产阶级世界观，那就是为了集体利益，为共产主义事业奋斗到底。
    如果我们有正确的世界观，那么，我们在农村生产，就会认识到农村的前途是非常远大的，特别是党中央和毛主席提出了以农业为基础，大办农业、大办粮食的方针，任何一个愿为社会主义建设，为共产主义理想出力的人，农村正是他们大显身手，大有作为的地方，那会没有前途呢！
    我回乡三年，自己感到没有作出什么特出的成绩，但是我有深刻的体会。
    1958年，党提出“向荒山进军，向红土壤要粮”的指示后，我便选好在离我家约二百米远的老虎形山开荒。这里遍地荆棘，刺破了手，用胶布胶上，刺破了衣服，把它缝好，三年来，挖掉了五百多担柴兜，打死了一百多条毒蛇。后来我又向红土壤开荒。过路人看见了，对我说：“祖昌叔讲打仗我是不懂，谈生产我比你强，这些土，作不出东西来，开翻了也是白费力。”这时，我记起了当年红军路过云南，看到红土壤也能种植南瓜，生长很好，瓜结的又多又大，难道这里的红土壤就不能种东西么？我开垦红土壤特别劲大，一直挖了一尺多深的泥肉，锄头挖断了十把，终于种上了各种作物，光1958年收获了南瓜、豆子三百多斤，红薯五百多斤。
    经过三年努力，共在老虎形山开荒四亩余，种果树三百六十多株，收获南瓜等五千多斤，红薯两千余斤，我家二十三个人吃饭，蔬菜、杂粮做到了自给有余。队里有些老年人说：“红土壤作出这样好的东西，这是甘祖昌的‘命大’。”而那些青年人则反驳说：“什么命大，命小，这是人家吃得苦，泥肉挖得深，管理得好，所以才长出这样好的东西。”群众对于红土壤作不出好东西的想法已经消除了。今年县委指示大垦荒地，大种蔬菜。目前，社员都自觉地到老虎形山的红壤土上去开荒，起码开垦有一百亩以上，有的已经种上了蚕豆、豌豆、蔬菜等冬季作物。
    要想农业大发展，增加粮食生产，就必须充分挖掘潜力，叫低产田变成高产田。我家乡沿背大队就有低产水稻田六百多亩，占总面积的三分之一，要是把这些田改造过来，赶上高产田，对国家对人民该有多大的好处啊！因此，在1958年我提出了一个改造冬水田的计划。这一年赞成的人还不多，只在第七小队改了冬水田二十几亩，结果产量增加了一倍，1959年赞成改造冬水田的社员就多起来了。全大队共改造了冬水田二百二十四亩。这些田也比往年成倍地增产，其中有一丘二亩三分三厘的田，是我亲手改的，过去一般年成只收四百二十斤，可是1960年实收干谷九百一十多斤。现在全大队的社员都决心要将尚未改成的四百亩左右冬水田逐步改造过来。正如社员反映说：“冬水田，过去是水过冬，现在是绿肥过冬，那有不增产之理呢！”
    上面我只是谈了自己的一点体会。青年同志们，农村里要做的事情非常多，如果你对前途有了正确的认识，当你在生产或工作中取得了一点微小的成就的时候，你就会感到在农村参加生产和工作，同样能对党的事业作出重大的贡献，你就会自觉地感到农村的前途是远大的，农村是有出息的。（附图片）
