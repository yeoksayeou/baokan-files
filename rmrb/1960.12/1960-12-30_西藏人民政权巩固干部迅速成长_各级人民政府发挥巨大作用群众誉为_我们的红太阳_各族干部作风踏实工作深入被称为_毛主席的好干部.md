　　Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 29th. With the great victory of the democratic reform, the people's regimes at all levels in the Tibet region are being consolidated day by day, and a large number of Tibetan cadres are also growing up. Now, all seventy-two counties in the region have established county-level people's governments, and people's regimes in more than two hundred and thirty districts and more than one thousand three hundred townships have also been mostly established.

　　When establishing grassroots regimes in Tibet, the people, under the leadership of the Party, conducted full deliberation and discussion, and then elected the people they considered the best to work in the people's regime. When the Zhangre Township People's Government in the northern district of Lhasa City was established, the voters participating in the election accounted for 98% of the total number of voters in the township. Nima, an old woman who had been a slave to feudal lords for decades, said excitedly after receiving her voter certificate: "In the old government, the mouths of us working people were sealed, and our hands and feet were tied; today, under the leadership of the Party, the working people have been liberated, and have the right to elect their own government to work for themselves, and truly be the masters of the house." When the People's Government of Heihe County on the northern Tibetan grasslands was established, more than a thousand herdsmen held a grand celebration meeting. Ze Wang, an eighty-year-old herdsman, sang and danced with the young people. He said: "With the new people's regime protecting the interests of the people, feudal lords can never come to oppress and exploit us again."

　　In the past year, the people's regimes at all levels in Tibet have played a huge role in implementing the Party's various policies, leading the masses to carry out democratic reforms, developing production, arranging the lives of the masses, and developing cultural, educational, and health undertakings, and have therefore won the love and support of the people. The Lhasa Municipal People's Government arranged labor employment for more than six thousand unemployed people caused by the feudal serf system, which was praised by the Tibetan people. The broad masses of emancipated farmers and herdsmen call the people's regime "our red sun" and "our own government"; they call the staff of the people's government "good cadres of Chairman Mao" and "good stewards of the Tibetan people." They have expressed their determination to continuously consolidate and strengthen the people's democratic dictatorship under the leadership of the Party.

　　The rapid growth of a large number of Tibetan cadres has created favorable conditions for the establishment of people's regimes at all levels in Tibet. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC has been actively and conscientiously carrying out the work of training ethnic minority cadres. Before the Tibetan upper-class reactionary group launched a rebellion, the relevant departments had successively absorbed more than six thousand children of Tibetan working people for training. Since the suppression of the rebellion and the implementation of democratic reforms, the work of training ethnic minority cadres has been greatly developed. Now, there are many Tibetan cadres in various work positions in Tibet. There are more than three hundred people serving as county heads and district heads alone. They eat, live, work, and discuss with the broad masses, becoming a major revolutionary force in Tibet. In the democratic reform and the great agricultural production movement, a large number of activists have also emerged from the emancipated farmers and herdsmen. According to statistics from the three special districts (cities) of Lhasa, Shannan, and Nagqu, more than 48,000 activists with high awareness and firm stand have emerged. They serve as leaders in township farmers' associations, herdsmen's associations, or township people's governments, and are deeply loved by the masses. (Attached picture)

The masses call him a good mutual aid team leader.

    西藏人民政权巩固干部迅速成长
    各级人民政府发挥巨大作用群众誉为“我们的红太阳”
    各族干部作风踏实工作深入被称为“毛主席的好干部”
    新华社拉萨29日电　随着民主改革的伟大胜利，西藏地区各级人民政权日益巩固，藏族干部也大批成长起来。现在，全区七十二个县已经全部建立了县级人民政府，二百三十多个区、一千三百多个乡的人民政权也已大部建立起来。
    西藏各地在建立基层政权时，人民群众都在党的领导下进行了充分的酝酿和讨论，然后选出他们认为最好的人到人民政权中工作。拉萨市北城区张热乡人民政府成立时，参加选举的选民占全乡选民总数的98％。给封建领主当了几十年奴隶的尼玛老妈妈领到选民证后激动地说：“在旧政府，我们劳动人民的嘴是被封着的，手和脚是被捆着的；今天，在党的领导下，劳动人民翻身解放了，有权利选举自己的政府为自己办事，真正是当家作主了。”藏北草原上黑河县的人民政府成立时，一千多名牧民隆重地举行了庆祝大会。八十多岁的老牧民泽旺和青年人在一起高歌欢舞。他说：“有了人民的新政权保护人民的利益，封建领主永远也不能再来压迫剥削我们了。”
    西藏各级人民政权一年来在贯彻执行党的各项政策，领导群众进行民主改革、发展生产、安排群众生活和发展文教、卫生等事业中，都发挥了巨大的作用，因而获得了人民的热爱和拥护。拉萨市人民政府将封建农奴制度造成的六千多名失业人口安排了劳动就业，受到西藏人民的颂扬。广大翻身农牧民把人民政权称为“我们的红太阳”、“自己的政府”；把人民政府的工作人员称为“毛主席的好干部”和
  “西藏人民的好当家人”。他们纷纷表示要在党的领导下，不断巩固和加强人民民主专政。
    大批藏族干部的迅速成长，为西藏各级人民政权的建立创造了有利条件。西藏和平解放后，中共西藏工委就一直积极认真地进行了培养民族干部的工作，在西藏上层反动集团发动叛乱前，有关部门曾先后吸收了六千多名西藏劳动人民的子弟进行培养。平息叛乱和实行民主改革以来，培养民族干部的工作有了更大发展，现在，西藏的各个工作岗位上都有很多藏族干部，仅担任县长和区长的就有三百多人，他们和广大群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，成为西藏一支主要的革命力量。在民主改革和农业大生产运动中，从翻身农牧民里还涌现出大批积极分子。据拉萨、山南、那曲三个专区（市）的统计，涌现出来的觉悟高、立场坚定的积极分子就有四万八千多人，他们在乡农民协会、牧民协会或乡人民政府担任领导职务，深受群众爱戴。（附图片）
