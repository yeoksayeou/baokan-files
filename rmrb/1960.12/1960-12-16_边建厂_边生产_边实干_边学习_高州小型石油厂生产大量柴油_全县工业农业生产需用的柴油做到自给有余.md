(Reported by this newspaper) The Gaozhou Petroleum Plant in Guangdong Province, adhering to the principle of primarily relying on indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign techniques, and progressing from indigenous to foreign approaches, has overcome numerous difficulties over the past two years. Its petroleum production has grown from small to large, and from single to multiple products, powerfully supporting industrial and agricultural production.

The Gaozhou Petroleum Plant is a small-scale petroleum plant that refines oil shale. In the two years since its establishment, it has provided the state with a total of 4,928 tons of crude oil. The plant has also vigorously engaged in the comprehensive utilization of petroleum, trial-producing 33 kinds of products, of which 14 products have already been put into production: kerosene, light diesel, heavy diesel, paraffin wax, grease, asphalt, petroleum coke, anti-corrosion oil, lubricating oil, lubricating grease, crude phenol, sodium humate, soil fertilizer, and pesticides. Currently, the diesel needed for industrial and agricultural production in the entire county is more than self-sufficient. The lubricating oil needed for agricultural and sideline product processing machinery and transportation vehicles throughout the county, as well as paraffin wax, an important raw material needed for manufacturing matches and candles in the county, can also be guaranteed.

The construction process of the Gaozhou Petroleum Plant is a process of exerting great effort and overcoming difficulties. At that time, building materials were very scarce; not only were there no steel bars or cement, but even red bricks and lime were lacking. The only equipment was a 20-horsepower diesel engine transferred by the county party committee from a water conservancy construction site. However, they were not daunted by the difficulties. Without red bricks, they collected old bricks. When red bricks were not enough, they used mud, and even dug soil on the spot to build dry distillation piles. Without lime, they used mud; without steel pipes, they used ceramic pipes and bamboo pipes; without powered ventilation and pumping equipment, they used homemade foot-operated ventilators and dragon-bone waterwheels instead. Due to insufficient technical strength in infrastructure construction, they organized 64 workers who had built earth stoves in rural areas, with a few technicians from the county construction company providing guidance, learning while doing. Lacking construction tools, they used hemp rope to make line reels, tied a stone to hemp thread as a plumb bob, and used kitchen knives as trowels for laying bricks. In this way, they overcame numerous difficulties by all possible means, and with the help of technicians from the old oil plant, they learned and did, and finally refined oil.

For more than two years, this plant has been building while producing. Production equipment and operating techniques have been gradually improved, going from simple to complex. Taking dry distillation of shale as an example, they started with small piles, operating entirely by hand. Later, after the workers learned the infrastructure construction and operating techniques of pile distillation, they boldly took a step forward and created the "pile cluster" production method. Subsequently, they built small square furnaces. This type of small square furnace is semi-mechanized; one furnace can produce 300 tons of crude oil per year, which is many times better than dry distillation piles. Currently, the plant is transitioning towards small foreign clusters production, with about half of the entire dry distillation equipment capacity already using small square furnace production, and two small square furnaces each with an annual output of 3,000 tons of crude oil have been basically completed. In terms of production tools, due to continuous improvement by workers in practice, they gradually changed from using wooden dragon-bone waterwheels for pumping water and foot-operated blowers for ventilation to machine pumping and machine ventilation, greatly improving dry distillation efficiency. In terms of crude oil processing, iron pot distillation was originally used, which had low efficiency and poor product quality; after the workers accumulated distillation experience, they improved the equipment, and the processing method was upgraded to kettle distillation and pipeline distillation, greatly improving production efficiency.

In the process of continuous development, this plant has also cultivated a large number of technical personnel. Two years ago, the workers in this plant were all farmers, urban residents, and students who did not understand oil refining technology at all. However, due to their diligent study, taking the method of learning while doing, with masters training apprentices, and senior apprentices training junior apprentices, in just over two years, they trained 360 dry distillation workers, 53 refining workers, 88 mechanics, 30 carpenters and ironworkers, and 23 chemical experimenters, thereby ensuring the normal operation of dry distillation, refining, testing, and machinery, and being able to solve the maintenance, welding, and installation of general mechanical equipment by themselves, and also training 265 apprentices for other factories.

The continuous development and expansion of the factory has led to a corresponding increase in the need for labor and equipment. However, instead of simply asking the higher authorities for more labor to expand production, the Gaozhou Petroleum Plant has relied on vigorously carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution, and improving labor efficiency to solve the shortage of labor; instead of waiting for equipment, it has relied on the masses and self-reliance to equip itself while the higher authorities allocate the necessary equipment. During the "four modernizations" movement, the workers created a variety of indigenous equipment, actively improved operating methods, and improved labor conditions, thereby achieving high output, high quality, high labor efficiency, and reducing costs. During the "four modernizations" movement, the main innovation projects, such as the indigenous winch for mine hoisting, the mechanical scrubber, the self-flow cooling water for dry distillation pile clusters, the wind-powered mixer, the centrifugal wax press, the underground oil pipeline, and gas processing, have played an extremely significant role in breaking through production bottlenecks and improving labor efficiency. For example, the self-flow cooling water for dry distillation pile clusters, which the workers successfully tested many times, used indigenous methods to cut mountains to divert water, and used one water pump to solve the self-flow cooling water for eight dry distillation pile clusters, not only improving efficiency but also saving two water pumps. The indigenous mine hoisting winch also increased efficiency by twenty times. In addition, the rapid dry distillation method was also promoted, accelerating the dry distillation time by more than two times. After the small square furnace was built, the entire set of advanced operating methods was quickly explored and mastered, overcoming the problem of coking in the small square furnace, and ensuring the normal production of the small square furnace. Therefore, this year, the entire plant has saved a total of 250 laborers. The dry distillation operation of the entire plant has been reduced from more than 300 people to the current 96 people, but the crude oil output has increased by more than double compared to last year. With the development of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, product quality has also continuously improved, and costs have continuously decreased. The main products basically meet the quality requirements stipulated by the state and are welcomed by users. This year's crude oil production cost has also decreased by 55% compared to the fourth quarter of last year.

    高州小型石油厂生产大量柴油
    全县工业农业生产需用的柴油做到自给有余
    本报讯　广东省高州石油厂坚持以土为主、土洋结合、由土到洋的方针，两年多来克服了重重困难，使石油生产从小到大，从单一产品到多种产品，有力地支援了工农业生产。
    高州石油厂是利用油母页岩炼油的小型石油厂，建厂两年来，共为国家提供了四千九百二十八吨原油。这个厂还大搞石油综合利用，试制成三十三种产品，其中已投入生产的有：煤油、轻柴油、重柴油、石腊、黄油、沥青、油焦、防腐油、润滑油、润滑脂、粗酚、胡敏酸钠、土化肥、农药等十四种产品。现在，全县工农业生产需用的柴油，已自给有余。全县农副产品加工机具和运输车辆需用的润滑油，以及本县制造火柴、腊烛需用的重要原料石腊也能保证供应。
    高州石油厂的建设过程是鼓足干劲克服困难的过程。当时建筑材料很缺乏，不仅没有钢筋、水泥，而且连红砖、石灰也没有。唯一的设备，就是县委从水利工地抽调来的一台二十马力的柴油机。可是，他们并没有被困难吓倒。没有红砖，就收集旧砖。红砖不够用，就用泥浆，甚至就地挖土来建成干馏堆。没有石灰，就用泥浆；没有钢管，就用陶管、竹管；没有动力排风和抽水设备，就用土制脚踏排风机和龙骨水车代替。基建的技术力量不足，就把曾经在农村砌过土灶的六十四个工人组织起来，由县建筑公司的少数技术人员做辅导，边做边学。建筑用的工具不足，就用麻绳做线车，用麻线缚上一块石头当线垂，用菜刀来做砌砖用的泥刀。就这样，千方百计克服了重重困难，在老油厂技术人员的帮助下，边学边做，终于把油炼出来了。
    两年多来，这个厂是边建边生产的。在生产设备、操作技术等方面都是经过了逐步提高，从简到繁的过程。以干馏页岩为例，开始时是用小成堆干馏，全部用手工操作。后来工人学会了成堆干馏的基建和操作技术以后，便大胆向前跨进一步，创造了“堆群”生产的方法。接着，他们又兴建了小方炉。这种小方炉是半机械化生产的，一个炉一年能产原油三百吨，比之干馏堆大好几倍。目前，这个厂正向着小洋群生产过渡，全部干馏设备能力约有一半已经采用小方炉生产，并已基本建成两个每个年产三千吨原油的小方炉。在生产工具方面，由于工人在实践中不断加以改进，逐步从原来用木制龙骨水车抽水、脚踏鼓风机鼓风变为机器抽水机器鼓风，使干馏效率大大提高。在原油加工方面，原来用铁锅蒸馏，效率很低，产品质量不好；当工人们积累了蒸馏的经验以后，对设备进行了改进，加工的方法便提高到釜式蒸馏、管道式蒸馏，使生产效率大大提高。
    这个厂在生产不断发展的过程中，还培养了大批技术力量。两年前，这个厂的工人都是农民、城镇居民和学生，完全不懂得炼油技术。但是，由于他们苦学苦钻，采取边做边学，师傅带徒弟，大徒弟带小徒弟的办法，在短短两年多的时间里，就培养了三百六十名干馏工、五十三名炼制工、八十八名机械工、三十名铁木工和二十三名化工试验员，从而保证了干馏、炼制、化验和机器运转能够正常进行，一般的机械设备的维修、电焊、安装，都能自己解决，并且为外厂培训了二百六十五名徒工。
    工厂的不断发展壮大，劳动力和设备的需要量也相应增加。然而，高州石油厂不是靠伸手向上多要劳动力来扩大生产，而是靠大闹技术革新和技术革命，提高劳动效率来解决劳动力不足的；不是坐等设备，而是在上级调拨必要设备的同时，依靠群众，自力更生来装备自己的。工人们在“四化”运动中，创造了多种土设备，积极改进操作方法，改善劳动条件，因而实现了高产、优质、高工效，并且降低了成本。在“四化”运动中，主要的革新项目如矿井提升的土绞车、机械洗涤器、干馏堆群冷却用水自流化、风力搅拌机、离心榨腊机、地下输油管道和煤气加工等，在突破生产关键、提高劳动效率方面，都起到了极其重大的作用。例如：工人们经过多次试验成功的干馏堆群冷却用水自流化，就是用土办法劈山引水，用一台抽水机就解决了八个干馏堆群冷却用水自流化，不仅提高了工效，还节省了两台抽水机。用土办法试制成功的矿井提升绞车，工效也提高了二十倍，此外，还推广了快速干馏法，使干馏时间加快了两倍以上。小方炉建成了，就迅速摸索和熟练了整套先进操作法，克服了小方炉结焦的毛病，保证了小方炉正常生产。因此，今年来，全厂共节约了二百五十个劳动力。全厂干馏操作由原来的三百多人，减少到现在的九十六人，原油产量却比去年增加了一倍多。随着技术革新和技术革命运动的开展，产品质量也不断提高，成本不断降低。主要产品基本符合国家规定的质量要求，受到用户的欢迎。今年的原油生产成本，也比去年第四季度下降了55％。
