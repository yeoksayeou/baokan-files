    Investigate · Prioritize · Implement

    No matter what work you do, to do it well, in addition to being familiar with the Party's principles and policies, you also need to understand the situation, analyze the situation, grasp the key points, and mobilize the masses to ensure that policies and tasks are effectively fulfilled. Some people summarize this work process as investigate—prioritize—implement. This experience is well summarized.

    Investigate—prioritize—implement, this experience reflects a complete sequence and process of our work, and at the same time, it is a manifestation of the Party's realistic, thorough and meticulous work style.

    Investigate means to understand the situation. No matter what work is done, it is emphasized that investigation should be done first, because only by clearly understanding the situation and thoroughly understanding the details of the objective reality can we have a clear understanding and a solid foundation for doing things, and avoid making subjective mistakes. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The basic tasks of the Communist Party's leading organs lie in two major things: understanding the situation and mastering policies. The former is called understanding the world, and the latter is called transforming the world." Investigation is an important means of understanding the world, and it is also an important prerequisite for correctly grasping and implementing policies and transforming the world. The objective situation is the basis and foundation for all our actions. Without understanding the objective situation, action is blind. Some comrades are satisfied with being relatively familiar with the situation in their area, and therefore do not pay attention to regular investigation work. These comrades do not understand that things are constantly developing and changing, especially in the great era of the Great Leap Forward, new things are constantly emerging; if investigation work is not carried out regularly, it will inevitably lead to their thinking being divorced from reality, and making subjective mistakes in their work. Some comrades also believe that the Party's policies are the guidelines for all work, and it is enough to do things according to the Party's policies, and investigation is not important. It is true that the Party's policies are the guide for all our work, and we must seriously and unswervingly act in accordance with the policies. However, the situations in different regions vary greatly, and the specific steps and methods for implementing policies should also be different in different regions at different times and under different conditions. When implementing the Party's policies, we must understand the specific situation of our region and adopt methods, steps and measures that are suitable for this situation in order to implement them well. Therefore, understanding the situation and mastering policies are inseparable. What people call investigation should naturally be to investigate specific and real details. This requires practical investigation, going to the masses, going to production, going to life, "working in the mud and water" with the masses, eating and living with the masses, and consulting with the masses in case of trouble. Only in this way can we thoroughly investigate the details.

    After clarifying the details and understanding the situation, it is also necessary to analyze and prioritize. Rank the various work tasks and the problems to be solved, distinguish the heights and lengths, and distinguish the priorities, see which link has a decisive impact on the overall situation, so as to first grasp the main link and drive the other links. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "In the development process of complex things, there are many contradictions, one of which must be the main contradiction, and its existence and development determine or affect the existence and development of other contradictions." In work, only by grasping the main contradictions and studying and solving them can other contradictions be solved easily, thereby promoting the progress of overall work. However, the main contradictions are often not obvious. To grasp the main contradictions, you need to use your brain and think and analyze repeatedly. Some comrades believe that anyway, all work needs to be done. Therefore, facing complex situations and a lot of work, they are not good at analyzing and prioritizing, and cannot distinguish between sesame seeds and watermelons, and regard all work as equally high and equally important. As a result, they grab a handful of this and a handful of that, pressing ten fleas with ten fingers, unable to move or catch them; the main ones are not grasped well, and the secondary and general ones are not grasped well either. Even if they travel a lot, hold a lot of meetings, and spend a lot of time, they still cannot do their work well. This situation should be resolutely prevented. We emphasize grasping the main contradictions precisely to do a good job of the overall work, because the main contradictions play a decisive role in the entire work, and once the main contradictions are resolved, other contradictions will be easily resolved. Therefore, under the premise of grasping the key problems, it is also necessary to solve the non-major problems one by one, and it is also wrong to ignore this aspect of work. In particular, the Party committees that lead the overall work should learn Comrade Mao Zedong's "playing the piano" working method, and in a certain period, handle the relationship between the key and the general well, so as to highlight the center and take care of the general.

    Investigation and prioritization are basically in the stage of understanding the objective world, and understanding the objective world is for the purpose of transforming the objective world. Understanding the situation is for the purpose of mastering policies and doing a good job. Therefore, when we understand the situation, grasp the key points, and formulate practical plans and measures, we should immediately implement the policies, tasks, plans, and measures. The implementation of policies, tasks, plans, and measures first depends on whether the cadres go deep into the work. That is to say, cadres must go deep down, implement "four togethers" with the masses, and fully mobilize and rely on the masses to hand over the Party's policies and key issues in the work to the masses, and hand over the methods and measures to solve problems to the masses. In this process, we should repeatedly publicize and explain to the masses, so that they become their own things, and then the cadres and the masses, in accordance with the Party's policies, carry out the work in depth and thoroughly, so that the policy is implemented to the masses. Some comrades are often only accustomed to general appeals. When a task comes down, they hold a meeting to arrange it and convey it, and then walk around everywhere, thinking that they have completed the task. In this way, it is difficult to truly implement plans, tasks, and policies. We should know that the masses cannot fully understand and accept what the Party advocates and the Party's policies all at once. They either do not understand why they do this, or they still have doubts about some point. This is often difficult to avoid. Therefore, only when cadres repeatedly publicize and explain to the masses, and "take off their shoes and go to the fields," "take the lead," walk in front, and set an example, can they truly inspire the masses' awareness, stimulate the masses' enthusiasm, implement the Party's policies well, and do a good job.

    It can be seen that investigate—prioritize—implement is a complete dialectical process for us to do a good job. The three are interconnected and interact with each other, and none of them can be missing. The clearer the details are investigated, the more accurate the key points are grasped, and the more implemented the Party's policies and various work tasks will be. In carrying out various tasks, we should consciously and practically master and apply this experience.

### 摸底·排队·落实

    摸底·排队·落实
    不论做什么工作，要做得好，除了熟悉党的方针政策以外，还需要了解情况，分析情况，抓取关键，发动群众，使政策和任务切实兑现。有人把这个工作的过程归纳起来，叫做摸底—排队—落实。这条经验总结得很好。
    摸底—排队—落实，这条经验反映了我们进行工作的一个完整的顺序和过程，同时，又是党的实事求是、深入细致的工作作风的表现。
    摸底，就是了解情况。不管做什么工作，所以强调要首先摸底，这是因为，只有了解清楚了情况，摸清楚了客观实际的底细，才能做到胸中有数，办事有根，不犯主观主义的错误。毛泽东同志说过：“共产党领导机关的基本任务，就在于了解情况和掌握政策两件大事，前一件事就是所谓认识世界，后一件事就是所谓改造世界。”摸底，是认识世界的一个重要手段，也是正确掌握和贯彻执行政策、改造世界的一个重要前提。客观情况是决定我们一切行动的依据和基础，没有对客观情况的了解，行动就是盲目的。有的同志，满足于对自己所在地区的情况原来比较熟悉，因而，不注意经常的摸底工作。这些同志不懂得，事物无时不在发展变化着，特别是在大跃进的伟大时代，新事物不断出现；如果不经常地进行摸底工作，就必然使自己的思想脱离实际，在工作中犯主观主义的错误。也有的同志认为，党的政策是进行一切工作的准绳，按照党的政策办事就行了，摸底不摸底不关重要。不错，党的政策是我们进行一切工作的指南，我们必须严肃认真地毫不动摇地按政策办事。但是，各个地区的情况千差万别，在不同地区不同时间不同条件下，具体执行政策的步骤和方法也是应该有差别的。在执行党的政策的时候，必须了解本地区的具体情况，采取适合这种情况的方法、步骤和措施，才能执行得好。所以，了解情况和掌握政策这两件大事，是密不可分的。人们所说的摸底，自然应该是要摸具体的、真实的底。这就需要切实地去摸，到群众中去，到生产中去，到生活中去，和群众一起“泥里水里地干”，和群众一起吃、一起住，遇事同群众商量，这样做才能把底摸透。
    摸清了底子，了解了情况以后，还需要进行分析、排队。把各项工作任务，要解决的问题，排一排高矮、分一分轻重缓急，看准哪个环节对全局起着决定性的影响，以便首先抓住主要环节，带动其它各个环节。毛泽东同志教导我们说：“在复杂的事物的发展过程中，有许多的矛盾存在，其中必有一种是主要的矛盾，由于它的存在和发展，规定或影响着其他矛盾的存在和发展。”在工作中，只有抓住了主要矛盾，加以研究解决，其他矛盾就可以迎刃而解，从而推动全面工作的进行。但是，主要矛盾往往不是摆在明面上的。要抓取主要矛盾，就需要用脑子，反复思考、分析。有的同志认为，反正什么工作都是需要干的。因而，他们面对着复杂的情况和一大堆工作，不善于分析、排队，分不清哪是芝麻，哪是西瓜，把所有的工作看成一般高，一样重要。结果，东抓一把，西抓一把，十个手指按着十个跳蚤，既动不得又抓不住；主要的抓不好，次要的一般的也抓不好，纵然是跑了很多路，开了很多会，花费了很多时间，结果仍然做不好工作。这种情况是应当坚决防止的。我们强调抓主要矛盾，正是为了把全盘工作做好，因为主要矛盾在整个工作中起着决定性的作用，主要矛盾解决了，其他矛盾也就好解决了。因此，在抓好关键问题的前提下，也要切实地一个一个地解决非主要的问题，忽视这方面的工作也是不对的。特别是领导全盘工作的党委机关，应当学会毛泽东同志教导的“弹钢琴”的工作方法，在一定时期内，把重点和一般的关系处理好，做到突出中心，照顾一般。
    摸底、排队，基本上都是属于认识客观世界的阶段，而认识客观世界是为了改造客观世界。了解情况，是为了掌握政策，做好工作。因此，当我们了解了情况，把握住了关键，订出了切实的计划和措施以后，就应该立即使政策、任务、计划、措施落实兑现。政策、任务、计划、措施的落实，又首先决定于干部是否深入工作。就是说，干部一定要深入下去，与群众实行“四同”，并且充分发动群众，依靠群众，把党的政策和工作中的关键问题交给群众，把解决问题的方法和措施交给群众。在这当中，应当反复地向群众进行宣传解释，使之变成群众自己的东西，然后干部和群众一道，按照党的政策，把工作搞深搞透，使政策条条落实到群众中去。有的同志，往往只习惯于一般号召，任务下来，开会往下一布置，一传达，然后各处转一转，就以为完事大吉。这样就很难真正使计划、任务、政策落实。我们应该知道，群众对党所提倡的事情，对党的政策，不可能一下子就全理解了，接受了，他们或者不了解为什么这样做，或者在哪一点上还有怀疑，这常常是很难免的。所以，只有干部向群众反复宣传解释，并“脱鞋下田”，“身先士卒”，走在前面，做出样子，才能够真正启发群众的觉悟，激发群众的干劲，执行好党的政策，做好工作。
    由此可见，摸底—排队—落实，是我们做好工作的一个完整的辩证的过程。三者互相联系，互相作用，缺一不可。底摸得越清，关键抓得越准，党的政策、各项工作任务就会更加落实。进行各项工作，都应自觉地、切实地掌握和应用这条经验。
