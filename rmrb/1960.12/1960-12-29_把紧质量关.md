    Tighten Quality Control
    A crucial task is to rigorously control quality and prevent any substandard products from leaving the factory. After I became a quality inspector for our group, I dedicated myself to improving this work. I realized that relying solely on one person, two hands, and two eyes was insufficient; everyone needed to participate. After discussing it with everyone, the entire group agreed. Therefore, we established a system where two people from our group would rotate daily to inspect quality, with a focus on randomly checking each person's products and addressing any issues promptly. When we encountered more difficult problems, we would discuss them collectively and research solutions together. Once, we discovered that the printed mats were not clean. We held a meeting to discuss the issue, and through everyone's input, we identified the key problem: the printing plates were not being cleaned thoroughly enough. The group then specifically implemented a rule: the printing plates must be thoroughly cleaned every time. Since then, this problem has been resolved.
    To ensure product quality, in addition to diligent inspection, it's also important to do preventative work. One comrade was not concentrating during production, which made the products prone to defects. I repeatedly explained to her the importance of ensuring and improving product quality, calculated the potential losses for her, and helped her learn specific methods to prevent product defects. Now, the quality of the products everyone produces is even higher.

    把紧质量关
    把好质量关，不让一件不合格的产品出厂，是一个重要任务。我担任小组质量检查员以后，就一心一意要把这件工作搞好。我想：光靠一个人一双手两只眼睛查，是不解决问题的，一定要大家动手才行。我和大家一商量，全组同志都很赞成。于是，我们组里就确定每日有二人轮流检查质量，对每个人的产品重点抽查，发现问题，及时解决。碰到一些比较难解决的问题，就集体讨论，集体研究解决办法。有一次，发现印出来的席不清洁，大家就开会研究，你一句，我一句，找到问题的关键是印花板洗得不够干净。小组里就专门规定了一项制度：洗印花板的时候一定要彻底洗干净。从此，这个问题就解决了。
    要保证产品质量，除了勤检查，还要做好预防工作。有个同志生产时思想不集中，产品容易出毛病，我就向她反复说明保证和提高产品质量的意义，算一笔损失账给她听，同时帮助她掌握了预防产品出毛病的具体办法。现在，大家生产的产品质量更高了。
