People Preparing Conditions for Next Year's Agricultural Harvest
By our correspondent in Hunan

This is an account of what we saw and heard in the countryside. We have personally witnessed the tremendous power generated by the Party's guidelines and policies, and the beautiful prospects for a major agricultural development next year.

People Who Care About Production and Love the Collective

In early winter, this reporter visited Dongshan People's Commune in Xiangxiang County. As soon as we entered the commune's land, we saw large areas of grass seeds (green manure). The grass seedlings were about three inches high, and each field had drainage ditches, dividing the grass seed fields into neat rectangular grids, like a chessboard. It was a joy to see so much green manure! In a grass seed field, we met a commune member carrying a load of grass ash, carefully spreading a layer of ash fertilizer on the green manure field. He said it was to give the grass seeds a "cotton coat" and apply a warming fertilizer. This commune member is named Zhou Lianqiao, in his forties. Speaking of him, people say he loves green manure like he loves his son. In mid-November, a cold wave came, the weather was cold, and it was raining. Their work team still had thirteen mu of late rice to harvest, and the fields were already submerged in two or three inches of water. The rain continued, and the grass seeds interplanted in the fields were all submerged. He immediately took off his shoes and jumped into the field to cut the rice and clear the way, digging ditches to drain the water for the grass seeds. He worked alone for half a day. When he returned for dinner, the commune members realized that five commune members had automatically signed up in the afternoon to join him in digging ditches and draining the water for the thirteen mu of grass seeds. Afterwards, he took the initiative to accumulate the stove ash from his daily cooking, totaling more than two hundred loads. Now, all these stove ashes have been used to give the green manure fields a "cotton coat." He said with a smile: "Green manure is the foundation for increasing production next year, how can we not protect it?" Later, we went to Baohé Brigade and saw three oxen, each fed so well that they were fat and strong, with round rumps. People said, "Such cattle will be like warhorses next year." The person who feeds these three cows is named Xiao Kecheng, a fifty-five-year-old poor peasant commune member. He feeds the cows most carefully and loves the collective the most. He has now prepared 5,000 jin of grass, 100 jin of bean husks, 20 jin of "cow wine" (wine brewed from barnyard grass to keep the cattle warm in winter), and more than 3,000 jin of rice straw for bedding for each cow, and built a warm water stove. The cowshed is made to: not leak rain, not let wind in, everything is good, and he has also prepared two sets of "peace medicine" for each cow. Baohé Brigade has widely promoted his experience. While the brigade cadre was introducing his situation to us, a person came carrying a basket of green grass, he was Xiao Kecheng. It turned out that he saw the weather getting colder and colder, and the leaves and green grass slowly withering. In order to ensure that the cattle could eat green grass in winter, he had to climb hills and slopes every day to find about twenty jin of green grass for the cattle. We asked him with a smile why he did this? He said: "The People's Commune is good, the Party's policies are good, I should feed the cows well so that we can harvest more grain next year."

Striving to Exceed the "Three Guarantees"

These days, the commune members of the Second Team of Zhoujia Brigade, Bitang Commune, Yongxing County, are launching a winter sowing campaign to exceed the "three guarantees." Zhoujia Village seems as vibrant as spring plowing, with the sounds of oxen plowing the fields, and the clamor of people transporting fertilizer, cultivating, and topdressing, resounding throughout the fields. The brigade's assigned 22 mu of winter sowing plan has been exceeded by more than two times. Comrade Wu Wanchao, the secretary of the Communist Youth League of the commune, who works in this team, told reporters: This year's winter production is more outstanding than last year's. The winter sowing area has increased by two times compared with last year. It is fast and good. Now the wheat has emerged three or four inches, and the broad beans and peas are four or five inches deep. More than 70% of the winter fallow fields have been plowed.

"With men and horses ready, weapons complete, having power and responsibility, and rewards for overproduction, it's like catching a turtle in a jar, absolutely certain." Such discussions can be heard everywhere from the commune members. Gaoling Mountain, a barren mountain in front of the village, was turned over in five days by the efforts of nineteen heroes who chiseled stones and opened mountains, and planted with wheat. There was a piece of barren land overgrown with thorns on Jigongxian Mountain. In the past, no one thought of reclaiming it. This year, the poor peasant Zhou Keshi led seventeen commune members to cut through thorns and brambles and reclaimed it during the high tide of expanding winter sowing.

Because the labor force is fixed, the team's work arrangements are also well organized. All thirty-nine main laborers in the team have specific divisions of labor. Six with high production skills cultivate beans, wheat, and vegetables, five plowing experts are responsible for plowing, four with specialized sideline skills are responsible for cash income, and nineteen strong young people make a surprise attack on autumn harvest and winter sowing. It is truly a case of everyone having something to do and everything being done by someone. Zhou Shengding, the farm tool keeper, has already collected large farm tools such as plows, harrows, rice threshers, and rice harvesters into the farm tool storage room. He uses his spare time to repair small problems on the farm tools, preparing good weapons for next year's spring plowing.

Prosperous Rural Market

December 3rd was the day for Daoxian County's Shouyan Ganxu (i.e., going to market). Not long after dawn, the roads leading from this small market town to the surrounding villages began to be filled with groups of people. Soon, the streets were noisy, and the sides of the streets were full of goods. There were all kinds of fresh vegetables such as radishes, cabbage, and peppers, all kinds of livestock and poultry such as chickens, ducks, and rabbits, small fish, shrimps, and also wild animals hunted from the mountains and wild plants collected, as well as various handicrafts such as brooms, brushes, and baskets. The entire street was almost completely filled with goods.

The purchasing department of the commune's supply and marketing cooperative was the most lively. Two purchasing agents were busy sweating profusely, constantly weighing mountain products for the commune members. Several commune members driving ox carts took bags of materials off the carts to be weighed, including seventeen loads of materials such as pangolin skin, Huangjingzi, and Mumen. The accountant calculated the price according to the variety and grade. The seller in front received the payment and counted it while happily saying: "I really didn't expect that these waste materials could add such a large income for us." This person was Xiong Kezheng, a cadre of the Shangwan Brigade. After selling the materials obtained from the "small autumn harvest," he ran to the means of production sales department. As soon as he entered the room, his eyes were fixed on the counter with various agricultural and sideline product processing machines. He immediately took a fancy to a sweet potato shredding and slicing machine, and also ordered some farm tools, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers.

Li Ding, a commune member of Tangjia Brigade who came to the market from more than ten miles away, sold a load of white radishes grown by the canteen and bought more than 700 sweet beet seedlings for the canteen. He also bought some new vegetable seedlings for his own family, preparing to go back and plant overwintering vegetables.

At Chen Dagong's Home

With winter sowing nearing completion, the winter life of Chen Dagong, a commune member of the Dishuijing Production Team of the Liling County Lujiang People's Commune, has also been arranged properly.

This reporter and Production Team Leader Zhou Yunxiao met Chen Dagong on a hillside called Hejiachong, where he was tidying up the vegetable soil. Dagong was already over sixty years old. He picked up a shiny bronze pipe from the ground, took out a small leather pouch containing tobacco shreds from his body, filled the pipe with tobacco, and offered it to us to smoke. He said while offering it: "Smoke it, our canteen planted more than two hundred sweet beets, and each commune member who smokes has been given several jin of dried tobacco leaves."

Below the hillside is Chen Dagong's home. This is a new tile-roofed house built in the year the commune was established. The location is well chosen, facing north and south, with good ventilation and sunshine. When we arrived at Dagong's house, his old partner opened the cabinet and took out several porcelain cups, poured strong tea for us from the kitchen, and we began to talk.

"Auntie, winter is here, how is the family's life arranged?"

The old woman said to us with a happy smile. She said: "Thanks to Chairman Mao's good leadership, every matter has been thought of for us commune members. The cotton for the nine people in the family has been provided. The cloth coupons issued by the state this year have also been bought back, and everyone has made new clothes."

Dagong's family has only one full laborer and three half-laborers, but they have already earned more than 9,000 work points by the end of November. The whole family plans to break through 10,000 work points soon. Dagong told us: The team has already issued eight wages this year, and his family still has some extra money, which is deposited in the commune's credit cooperative.

The lights were turned on in the evening. His son, Chen Yangcai, who serves as the administrator of the canteen, also returned. Three generations of the family gathered together, each preparing a "small warming basket" and placed it under their feet. Production Team Leader Zhou praised Dagong's daughter-in-law Yi Julan, saying: "Julani is really capable, she earned two hundred and twenty work points in November and also took good care of the housework." Julan quickly interjected and said: "No, it's all because the Party has arranged it well and the team leader has led us well." It turned out that last month, during her vacation (she rested for four days each month as stipulated), Yi Julan made two pairs of shoes for the children, patched five pieces of clothing, and also cut more than ten bundles of firewood for the family to keep warm in winter.

Jointly Discussing the Major Plan for Next Year's Production

In the Tenth Production Team of the Huangshajie People's Commune, Yueyang County, on the banks of Dongting Lake, commune member Zhou Futao has offered another plan for the team, which has been adopted by the team.

As early as the beginning of November, while the commune members were busy digging sweet potatoes, the old farmer Zhou Futao invited several old people during the noon break, carrying plows and driving cattle to the fields. The commune members felt strange when they saw it. "Others are busy digging potatoes, but he is carrying a plow." However, Party Branch Secretary Yang Lidan paid close attention. He determined that the old "advisors" must have come up with a good idea again. He ran over to take a look and saw Zhou Futao and several old farmers plowing the paddy fields while discussing something. When they saw Yang Lidan coming, they gathered around and explained their plan. It turned out that they had thought about it a long time ago that this year there was a severe drought for more than one hundred and fifty days, and the bottom of the fields was completely dry. They tried plowing it today and found it was indeed good. In order to strive for a good harvest next year, it is particularly important to plow and turn over the paddy fields early in winter. More attention should be paid to plowing and harrowing next year, so that the fields will not leak water. In addition, the field ridges should be tidied up and the field banks should be reinforced this winter, because the field ridges have been getting lower and lower over the years due to insect removal and grass skin removal, which is also detrimental to water storage and water retention in the fields!

Yang Lidan listened with rapt attention. The old farmers' active initiative to offer plans and ideas for next year's production greatly inspired him. He immediately discussed with the team committee members and adopted the old farmers' suggestions. He also publicly praised their exemplary actions. The commune members also thought of their own work from the actions of the old farmers. The feeder proposed that in order to produce next year, the cowshed should be repaired, sufficient winter grass should be stored, and the cattle should be fed well; the water manager requested that the small ponds and small dams should be reinforced... You offer one idea, he offers another, all saying: "This is a case of many hands make light work, everyone shares the burden, and we must plan for next year's affairs early."

Upon inquiring, we learned that since the spring plowing this year, because Branch Secretary Yang Lidan has been good at following the mass line, uniting a group of old farmers as "advisors," they have played no small role in production. The good harvests of early and mid-season rice and autumn sweet potatoes this year are all due to the efforts of the old farmers. No wonder Yang Lidan and the production team cadres attach so much importance to the opinions from the masses when talking about the major plan for a bumper harvest next year.

    为明年农业丰收准备条件的人们
    本报驻湖南记者
    这里记述的是我们在农村的一些见闻。我们亲眼看到了党的方针政策产生的巨大威力，看到了明年农业大发展的美好前景。
    关心生产热爱集体的人
    初冬季节，记者访问了湘乡县东山人民公社，一走进这个公社的土地，便可以看到成片的草子（绿肥），草子苗长得约有三寸高，每丘田都开了排水沟，把草子田分割成一个个整齐的长方形的格子，像棋盘一样。有这样多绿肥，真叫人看了高兴！在一块草子田里，碰到一个社员正挑着一担草木灰，仔细地给绿肥田撒上一层层灰肥，他说是给草子“穿棉衣”、施保温肥。这个社员名叫周连桥，四十多岁，提起他，人们都说他爱绿肥像是爱儿子。11月中旬，一次寒潮来了，天气冷，又落着雨。他们作业组有十三亩迟晚稻还没收，田里已浸了两三寸深的水，雨还落个不停，田里套种的草子全被水淹埋了。他立即打着赤脚，跳下田割禾、开路，给草子开沟排水，他一个人干了半天。回来吃饭时，社员们才知道，下午就有五个社员自动报名，和他一道给十三亩草子开了沟，排干水。以后，他便主动把每天烧灶的灶灰积起来，一共积了两百多担。现在，这些灶灰都用上了，给绿肥田“穿棉衣”，他笑着说：“绿肥是明年增产的根本，不保护它行吗？”后来，我们又到了保合大队，看到三条黄牛，头头喂得膘肥体壮，牛屁股滚圆的，人们都说：“这样的耕牛明年真如战马”。喂这三条牛的人，名叫萧克成，是个五十五岁的贫农社员，他喂牛最仔细，也最爱集体。现在他为每头牛准备了五千斤草、一百斤豆壳、二十斤“牛酒”（用稗子酿的酒，为耕牛过冬御寒）、三千多斤垫栏禾蔸草，搭了温水灶。栏屋做到：屋不漏雨，墙不进风，样样好，还给每头牛准备了两副“太平药”。保合大队普遍推广了他的经验。在大队干部向我们介绍他的情况的当儿，一个人背着一篓青草走来了，他就是萧克成。原来，他看到天气一天天寒冷，树叶、青草慢慢枯萎了，为了使耕牛在冬天吃到青草，每天他爬山上坡，总要给耕牛寻找二十来斤青草。我们笑着问他为什么这样做？他说：“人民公社好，党的政策好，我更应该把牛喂好明年才能多打粮。”
    争取超“三包”
    这几天，永兴县碧塘公社周家大队第二小队的社员们，正在开展一个冬播作物超“三包”战斗。周家村的村前村后，好像春耕一样的生气勃勃，赶牛翻田的?喝声，运肥、中耕、追肥的人们的喧哗声，响彻田野。大队分配的二十二亩冬播计划，已超过两倍。在这个小队工作的公社团委书记吴玩潮同志告诉记者：今年比去年的冬季生产搞得更出色，今年冬播面积比去年增加了两倍，又快又好，现在小麦已出土三、四寸，蚕、豌豆有四、五寸深，冬闲田已翻耕70％多了。
    “兵马齐备，武器齐全，有权有责，超产奖励，硬是坛子里摸乌龟，十拿九稳”。现在到处可以听到社员们这样的议论。村门口一座荒山——高岭山，在十九个凿石开山英雄的努力下，五天翻了边，种上了麦子。鸡公仙山上有一块荆棘丛生的荒土，过去谁也没想起要开垦它，今年贫农周克诗在扩种冬播的高潮里，带了十七个社员劈荆斩棘，把它开垦过来了。
    由于劳力固定，小队里安排工夫，也是井井有条，全小队三十九个主要劳力，都有专职分工，六个生产技术高的培育豆、麦和蔬菜，五个犁田能手包犁田，四个有副业技术专长的抓现金收入，十九个身强力壮的青年突击秋收冬播。真是人人有事做，事事有人做。农具保管员周圣鼎已经把犁、耙、打稻机、割禾器等大农具，收进农具保管室，他趁早晚空隙时间，自己动手整修农具上的小毛病，为明年春耕准备好利器。
    繁荣的农村集市
    12月3日，是道县寿雁赶墟（即赶集）的日子。天刚亮不久，这个小集镇伸向周围乡村的道路上，已开始出现成群结队的人们。一会儿，街道上人声嘈杂，街道两旁摆满了东西。这里有萝卜、白菜、辣椒等各种各样的新鲜蔬菜，有鸡、鸭、兔子等各类家畜家禽，有细鱼、小虾，也有从山区猎获的野兽和采集的野生植物，也有扫帚、刷把、提篮等形形色色的手工业产品，整个街道，几乎全被货物堆满了。
    公社供销部的采购门市部算是最热闹的了，两个收购员忙得满头大汗，不停地给社员们称山货。几位赶牛车的社员把车上一袋袋的物资取下来过磅，什么山甲皮、黄荆子、木面等一共十七担，会计员在按品种分等级算好价款。走在前面的那位卖主接到价款一边清点、一边欢喜地说：“真没有想到，这些废物还能为我们增加一笔这样大的收入。”这个人就是上湾大队的干部熊克正。他卖完“小秋收”搞来的物资以后，就跑到生产资料门市部。一进屋，眼睛就盯着那个摆有各种农副产品加工机器的柜台，马上看中了一部红薯刨丝切片机，还订购了一些农具、农药和化学肥料。
    从十多里路以外来赶墟的唐家大队社员李顶卖完食堂种的一担白萝卜以后，又帮食堂买了七百多蔸甜菜秧子。他自己家里也买了一些新的菜秧，准备回去种越冬菜。
    在陈大公的家里
    冬播已接近尾声，醴陵县渌江人民公社滴水井生产队社员陈大公家里的冬季生活，也安排得妥妥贴贴。
    记者和生产队长周云孝在一个叫荷家冲的山坡上，遇见了陈大公，他正在整菜土。大公已六十多岁了。他从地里拿起一个光光亮亮的青铜烟斗，在身上掏出装烟丝的小皮荷包，上烟给我们抽。他边让边说：“抽吧，我们食堂里种了两百多兜烟，会抽烟的社员每人都分得了好几斤干烟叶。”
    山坡下，就是陈大公的家，这是公社成立那年新盖的瓦房，地址选的好，坐北朝南，通风向阳。到了大公的屋里，他的老伴打开柜子拿出几只瓷杯，从厨房里冲了浓茶给我们喝，就谈起来了。
    “大娘，冬天来了，家中生活安排得怎样了？”
    大娘喜笑颜开地向我们说开了。她说：“多亏毛主席的领导好，样样事情都给我们社员想到了，家里大小九口人的棉花都有了，今年国家发的布票，也都已买回来，每个人都做了新衣。”
    大公一家，全劳力只一个，半劳动力三个，到11月底止却已做了九千多个工分了，全家打算在最近突破一万个工分。大公告诉我们：今年队上已发了八次工资，他家还有一些余钱，存在公社的信用部里。
    晚上点了灯。在食堂担任事务长的儿子陈扬才也回来了，一家三代人团聚一堂，每人都准备了一个“小烘笼”，放在脚底下。生产队周队长夸奖大公的儿媳易菊兰说：“菊兰真是能干，11月份做了二百二十个工分，又搞好了家务。”菊兰连忙插嘴说：“哪里，还不是党安排好，队长领导得好。”原来在上个月，易菊兰在假期中（按规定每月休息了四天），她为小孩做了两双鞋子，补了五件衣裤，还砍了十多捆家庭冬天取暖的柴火。
    共商明年生产大计
    在洞庭湖滨的岳阳县黄沙街公社黄金大队第十生产队，社员周福涛又为队里献了一条计，已经被队里采纳了。
    早在11月初，社员们正忙着挖红薯，老农周福涛在中午休息时，却约了几个老人，扛着犁，赶牛下地了。社员们看了都觉得稀奇。“别人忙挖薯，他却扛起犁。”而党支部书记杨理端却十分注意，他断定：一定是老“顾问”们又出了什么好主意了。他跑去一看，周福涛和几个老农，边犁板田，边商量着什么，见杨理端来了，就围拢来说出他们的打算。原来，很早他们就想到今年大旱一百五十多天，田底子都干透了，今天试犁一下，果然不错。为了争取明年丰收，早犁冬翻板田特别重要。明年的犁耙工夫更要注意，才能做到本田不漏水。另外，今年冬天还要整理田塍，加固田坎，原因是历年除虫铲草皮，田塍越铲越低，这样对本田蓄水、保水也不利呀！
    杨理端听得入了神，老农们积极主动为明年生产献计，出主意，使他受到很大启示，立即和队委们商议，采纳了老农的意见。并当众表扬了他们的模范行动。社员们又从老农的行动里一个个联想到自己的工作。饲养员提出为了明年生产，要整修牛栏，储足冬草，喂好耕牛；管水员要求把小塘小坝加固一道，……你一条，他一条，都说：“这是众人拾柴火焰高，千斤担子大家挑，明年的事要早打算到。”
    一打听，我们才知道从今年春耕以来，由于支部书记杨理端善于走群众路线，团结了一批老农当“顾问”，在生产上起了不小的作用。今年早中稻和秋红薯的丰收，都有老农的功劳，怪不得现在谈到有关明年的丰产大计，杨理端和生产队干部这样重视来自群众的意见了。
