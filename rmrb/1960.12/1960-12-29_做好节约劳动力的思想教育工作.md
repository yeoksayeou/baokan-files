Do a Good Job in Ideological Education on Saving Labor
The Chinese Communist Party Fengtai Bridge Factory Committee

The Fengtai Bridge Factory is a comprehensive concrete product factory serving the national railway construction cause. At the beginning of this year, our factory encountered two major problems: one was that with the development of the national construction cause, we had to ensure the completion of the national plan, which was 65% higher than last year's; the other was that we had to draw a large number of people to support the front line of agricultural production and support the new factory. We calculated that just to complete the task of increasing production by 65%, we would need to add 707 laborers, plus the tasks of supporting agriculture and supporting the new factory, the labor force required would be even greater. Therefore, from the beginning of the year, the factory Party committee has been grasping the work of saving labor, trying every possible means to tap labor potential, and letting go of the masses to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements centered on "four modernizations" (hereinafter referred to as "double innovation"), and asking for labor from machines and technology. The factory Party committee conveyed the plan and requirements for saving labor at all levels, and regarded rationally arranging labor, timely adjusting labor organization, reducing non-production personnel, and strengthening the production front line as regular work. It was also repeatedly emphasized that the quality and achievements of "double innovation" should not only depend on the completion of production tasks and the degree of "four modernizations," but also on how much labor was saved. In this way, the work of saving labor has aroused universal attention from top to bottom in the factory, and promoted workshops, sections, and groups to grasp this work firmly. As of October, the factory not only completed 91.7% of the national plan (which can guarantee the overfulfillment of the task), but also saved a quarter of the total number of employees, which was used to support agriculture and new enterprises.

According to our experience, the process of saving labor is a comprehensive and fundamental technical transformation process for production, and it is also a process of continuously improving enterprise management and rationally adjusting labor organization. There will inevitably be a struggle between advanced and backward ideas, and a struggle between innovative and conservative forces. Therefore, the process of realizing saving labor is a profound ideological revolution process. Only by earnestly doing a good job in ideological education and fully mobilizing the masses can we overcome difficulties and achieve the expected results.

Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution Movement is the Key to Saving Labor

When the factory Party committee proposed saving labor, it analyzed the situation of the entire factory and believed that launching a factory-wide technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization of loading, unloading, and transportation was the key to realizing saving labor. Because the cultural and technical level of workers in the transportation workshop was relatively low, some people at that time proposed: "We have neither technology nor culture, and we cannot engage in mechanized loading and unloading." And in the Ding Liang, sleeper, and asbestos pipe workshops, where "double innovation" had been relatively successful in the past few years, some people thought that their potential had been exhausted and there was nothing to do. In response to this situation, the factory Party committee, on the one hand, talked about the situation in the factory and broke down conservative ideas such as the "only conditions" theory, and on the other hand, concentrated the necessary manpower to go deep into the transportation workshop and work with the workers to engage in mechanized loading, unloading, and transportation. After only a short period of time, this workshop used waste materials to make 34 small carts, one 3-ton steam crane, and 19 mobile tower cranes and soil loading and unloading machines, plus some reforms in operation methods, the loading and unloading speed was accelerated, and labor efficiency was improved. This workshop originally needed to add 55 people, but not only did not add people, but also drew 40 people to support the newly launched sleeper workshop and fraternal factories, and their own tasks were also completed very well. The factory Party committee immediately seized this example and held a "double innovation" exhibition to conduct in-depth publicity and education for the employees. In the face of the facts, many people were encouraged and checked their own thinking, thus making the "double innovation" movement develop vigorously throughout the factory. In the past ten months, the factory has successively realized a series of technical transformation work such as streamlining steel processing, specializing welding production, streamlining demolding, grabbing sleeper gravel, storing Ding Liang gravel aggregate, and mechanizing woodworking.

Adjusting Labor Organization and Improving Enterprise Management to Create Conditions for Saving Labor

The gradual realization of technical transformation has greatly improved labor productivity and created conditions for saving labor. However, whether labor can be truly saved depends on the rational adjustment of labor organization and the improvement of enterprise management. According to our experience, with the realization of technical transformation, if the labor organization is not adjusted in time and enterprise management is not improved, and the labor saved due to the improvement of labor productivity is not drawn out in time, labor will still not be saved, and even labor waste may be caused, which will have a bad impact on production. Therefore, while grasping technical transformation, the factory Party committee also grasped the work of adjusting labor organization and improving enterprise management, and fought against the ideology of following the old rules. At that time, some people, due to being accustomed to handling affairs according to the old rules, always thought that "the original labor organization is already good, and it doesn't matter whether it is changed or not." Even more wrongly, some cadres still had the idea of keeping a backhand, thinking that it would be convenient to use labor if it was kept in their own hands. These comrades mainly did not understand that labor organization and management institutions serve production. With the improvement of productivity, labor organization and management institutions must also be changed accordingly to meet the needs of production development. In order to make everyone in the factory understand this truth, the factory Party committee launched a great airing, great blooming, and great debate centered on improving enterprise management and reducing non-production personnel, and at the same time mobilized workers to conduct a general inspection and reform of labor organization. And divided into two routes, one route went deep into the departments, merging the three units of the materials supply department, transportation workshop, and production department into the supply and marketing department, which improved work efficiency and reduced duplicate procedures, thus saving non-production personnel; the other route went deep into the Ding Liang workshop, and cultivated a typical example of reforming labor organization as soon as technical transformation was realized, thus drawing 160 laborers. Firmly grasping these facts, the Party committee also put forward the slogan of "Learning from Ding Liang and catching up with Ding Liang," which set off a climax of continuously improving labor organization and improving enterprise management throughout the factory. In less than ten months, this factory-wide reform has been carried out four times. According to the needs of production development, the organization has been adjusted in time, merged when it should be merged, and abolished when it should be abolished. At the same time, administrative procedures have been greatly simplified and work methods have been improved. As a result, because labor organization and management institutions are more streamlined and more reasonable, it can not only ensure the overfulfillment of the annual plan, but also save a large number of manpower: not only has all the more than 400 laborers saved in the "double innovation" movement been saved, but also more than 200 laborers and 46 non-production personnel have been saved. These facts have made us further realize that the development of technical innovation and technical revolution has made productivity move forward, and production relations must be adjusted in time. Only in this way can production relations adapt to the development level of productive forces, and can production relations play a role in promoting the development of productive forces.

Educating Employees to Establish the Idea of Continuous Revolution and Overall Concept to Lay an Ideological Foundation for Saving Labor

When carrying out the above ideological education work, we grasped these two issues. One is to educate employees to establish the idea of continuous revolution. In the past year, the process of saving labor in our factory has always been permeated with the struggle between the theory of continuous revolution and the theory of reaching the top. Some people understand the truth that the development of things is endless in words, but when they come into contact with specific problems, especially when work has made some achievements, their conservative ideas come out, such as what potential has been exhausted, there is nothing to change the equipment, and so on. If this wrong thinking is not corrected in time, technical transformation and improvement of labor organization cannot be carried out smoothly, and labor will naturally not be saved. It is precisely because the factory Party committee has always grasped the work of arming the masses of employees with the idea of continuous revolution, and whenever there are new and major achievements in the work, while praising and affirming the achievements, it also points out the existing problems in the work, and immediately calls on and organizes workers to start new battles. Therefore, whether it is technical innovation and technical revolution, or improving labor organization and enterprise management, it can develop more deeply step by step. For example, in terms of technical innovation and technical revolution, in the past, our factory produced concrete bridges, and the mixed concrete was transported entirely by manpower with iron shovels, and more than 90 people could only pour 20 cubic meters of concrete a day. Later, it was changed to elevated road production, realizing the cartization of transportation. More than 40 people can pour more than 40 cubic meters a day, and some people feel that this method is "very good." The factory Party committee promptly pointed out to everyone that although elevated roads are good, they are still produced in the open air, with high insulation costs, long production cycles, and high labor intensity. It is required that everyone continue to carry out technical transformation in response to these shortcomings. After the transformation, the production line was further realized, and more than 20 people could pour more than 40 cubic meters a day. At this time, is it "almost" as some people said? Of course not. Later, after the workers worked hard to study, they further realized the linkage of irrigation and manufacturing. On the basis of increasing work efficiency by one time and reducing personnel by 50%, another 80% of labor was saved.

Another issue is to focus on overall concept education and oppose departmentalism. We know that people are the decisive factor of productive forces. Therefore, doing a good job in saving labor and striving to create more material wealth with less manpower is not only an important task that an enterprise must always do well, but also a decisive link in developing the national economy at a high speed. We also know that things are interrelated. The various departments of the national economy, the various workshops and sections of a factory are an inseparable whole. If the industry occupies too much labor, the agricultural labor will inevitably decrease; in a factory, if this workshop or section occupies too much labor, the labor of other workshops or sections will inevitably decrease. Therefore, in order to do a good job in saving labor, it is necessary to educate employees to understand the value of human resources, to understand that the waste of labor is the greatest waste, and to educate employees to establish a strong overall concept, and to consider problems from the needs of the entire factory and the entire country. It should be said that the vast majority of employees in our factory understand this truth, but in the process of saving labor, we have also encountered various forms of departmentalism, which directly affected the transfer of labor to support the front line of agricultural production and fraternal units. In order to deepen and thoroughly carry out the work of saving labor, the factory Party committee conducted overall concept education for employees that local interests must be subordinate to overall interests, talked about the policy of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, talked about the country as a whole, and used "If the new factory is not launched, can the production of the old factory alone adapt to the rapid development of railway construction?" and "Why support agriculture? What actions should we take to support agriculture?" as topics to organize the entire factory staff to have a great airing, great blooming, and great debate. In order to make employees more deeply aware of the harm of departmentalism, the factory Party committee used the facts of the sleeper workshop to educate all employees. This workshop, due to breaking the idea of departmentalism, strengthening collaboration, and improving labor organization, has been reduced from 500 people at the beginning of the year to about 300 people, and the production tasks are still completed very well. This has given employees a vivid and profound education. Many workshop cadres and workers have taken the sleeper workshop as a mirror, examined their departmentalism, and established a strong overall concept. Therefore, the work of saving labor and transferring cadres has been carried out relatively smoothly.

    做好节约劳动力的思想教育工作
    中共丰台桥梁厂委员会
    丰台桥梁厂是为全国铁路建设事业服务的一个综合性混凝土制品工厂。今年一开始，我厂就遇到两大问题：一个是随着国家建设事业的发展，要保证完成比去年高65％的国家计划；另一个是要抽出大批人力支援农业生产第一线，支援新厂。我们计算了一下，单是为完成增产65％的任务，就需增加七百零七个劳动力，再加上支援农业和支援新厂的任务，所需的劳动力就更多。因此，从年初开始，厂党委就抓紧了节约劳动力的工作，千方百计地挖掘劳动潜力，放手发动群众大搞以“四化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动（以下简称“双革”），向机器设备和技术要劳力。厂党委把节约劳动力的计划和要求层层下达，把合理安排劳动力，适时地调整劳动组织，减少非生产人员，加强生产第一线，做为经常的工作。并且一再强调，“双革”搞得好坏与成绩大小，不仅要看生产任务完成情况与“四化”程度提高多少，还要看节约了多少劳动力。这样，节约劳动力的工作就引起了全厂从上到下的普遍重视，推动了车间、工段和小组都狠抓这项工作。到10月份为止，全厂不仅完成了国家计划的91.7％（可以保证超额完成任务），而且节约了占职工总数四分之一的人力，用以支援农业和新建企业。
    根据我们的体会，节约劳动力的过程，是对生产进行全面的根本性的技术改造过程，也是不断改进企业管理和合理调整劳动组织的过程，必然有先进思想和落后思想的斗争，革新力量与保守力量的斗争。因此，实现节约劳动力的过程，是一个深刻的思想革命过程，只有认真地做好思想教育工作，把群众充分地发动起来，才能战胜困难，收到预期的效果。
    技术革新和技术革命运动是节约劳动力的关键
    我厂党委提出节约劳动力的时候，就对全厂的情况作了分析，认为以大搞装卸运搬机械化为中心，掀起一个全厂规模的技术革新和技术革命运动，是实现节约劳动力的关键。由于运输车间工人的文化技术水平较低，当时就有人提出：“我们既无技术，又无文化，搞不了装卸机械化。”而过去几年“双革”搞得比较有成绩的丁梁、轨枕、石棉管等车间，又有人认为他们的潜力已经挖尽了，没有什么可搞的。针对这种情况，厂党委一面在全厂大讲形势，大破唯条件论等保守思想，一面集中必要的人力，深入到运输车间，和工人一起大搞装卸运搬机械化。只经过很短的时间，这个车间就利用废旧料制成了三十四辆小车、一台三吨蒸汽吊车和十九台走行塔式起重机和装卸土机械，再加上操作方法上的一些改革，装卸速度加快了，劳动效率提高了。这个车间原来需增加五十五人，结果不但没有增人，反而抽出四十人支援了新上马的轨枕车间和兄弟厂，而他们本身的任务完成得也很好。厂党委立即抓住这一事例，并且举办了“双革”展览会，对职工进行深入的宣传教育。在事实面前，许多人受到鼓舞，纷纷检查了自己的思想，从而使“双革”运动在全厂蓬勃地开展了起来。十个多月来，全厂已先后实现了钢筋加工流水化，电焊生产专业化，脱模流水化，轨枕砂石倒运抓斗化，丁梁砂石存运骨料化，木工机械化等一连串的技术改造工作。调整劳动组织，改进企业管理，为节约劳动力创造条件
    技术改造的逐步实现，大大地提高了劳动生产率，为节约劳动力创造了条件。但是，劳动力能否真正节约出来，还有待于劳动组织的合理调整和企业管理的改进。根据我们的经验，随着技术改造的实现，如果不适时地调整劳动组织，改进企业管理，把因提高劳动生产率而节约出来的劳动力及时地抽调出来，劳动力仍然是节约不了的，甚至会造成劳动力的窝工浪费，对生产发生不好的影响。因此，厂党委在抓技术改造的同时，也抓紧了调整劳动组织和改进企业管理的工作，同因循守旧的思想进行了斗争。当时，有些人由于习惯于按老规矩办事，总以为“原有的劳动组织已经不错了，改不改不打紧”。更错误的是，有些干部还有留一手的思想，认为劳动力留在自己手里，使用起来方便。这些同志主要是不懂得，劳动组织和管理机构是为生产服务的，随着生产力的提高，劳动组织和管理机构也必须作相应的改变，才能适合生产发展的需要。厂党委为了使全厂人人懂得这个道理，发动全厂干部进行了以改进企业管理、减少非生产人员为中心的大鸣大放大辩论，同时发动工人对劳动组织进行普遍的大检查、大改革。并且分兵两路，一路深入科室，把材料供应科、运输车间和生产科三单位合并为供销科，提高了工作效率，减少了重复手续，因而节约出了非生产人员；另一路深入到丁梁车间，培养了技术改造一实现，劳动组织就改革，因而抽出一百六十名劳动力的典型。紧紧抓住这些事实，党委又提出了“学丁梁、赶丁梁”的口号，使全厂掀起了不断改进劳动组织和改进企业管理的高潮。在不到十个月的时间内，这种全厂规模的改革就进行了四次，根据生产发展的需要，及时地调整了组织，该合并的合并了，该撤销的撤销了，同时还大力简化了行政手续，改进了工作方法。这样做的结果，由于劳动组织和管理机构更加精悍，更加合理，因而既可以保证超额完成全年计划，又节约了大批人力：不仅把“双革”运动中节约出来的四百多个劳动力都节约下来了，另外还节约了二百多个劳动力和四十六名非生产人员。这些事实使我们进一步认识到，技术革新和技术革命的开展，使生产力向前发展了，就必须适时地调整生产关系。只有这样，才能使生产关系同生产力的发展水平相适应，才能使生产关系起促进生产力发展的作用。
    教育职工树立不断革命的思想和整体观念，为节约劳动力打下思想基础
    在进行上述思想教育工作的时候，我们抓紧了这样两个问题。一个是教育职工树立不断革命的思想。近一年来，在我厂节约劳动力的过程中，始终贯穿着不断革命论和到顶论之间的斗争。有一些人在口头上是懂得事物的发展是没有止境的道理的，但是一接触到具体问题，特别是工作取得一些成就的时候，他们的保守思想就出来了，例如什么潜力已经挖光呀，设备再也没有什么可改的呀，等等。如果不及时纠正这种错误的思想，技术改造和劳动组织的改进就不可能顺利进行，劳动力自然也节约不下来。正是由于厂党委始终抓紧了用不断革命的思想武装职工群众，每当工作有了新的重大的成就，在表扬和肯定成绩的同时，也指出工作中还存在的问题，并且立即号召和组织工人开始新的战斗，因而不论是技术革新和技术革命，还是改进劳动组织和企业管理的工作，才能一步比一步更加深入地向前发展。例如，在技术革新和技术革命方面，我厂过去生产混凝土桥梁，搅拌好的混凝土全靠人力用铁簸箕运送，九十多人一天只能灌二十立方混凝土。以后改为高架道生产，实现了运搬车子化，四十多人一天能灌四十多立方，就有些人感觉这种方法“很不错”了。厂党委便及时地给大家指出，高架道虽然好，但还是露天生产，保温费大、生产周期长，体力劳动强度还很高，要求大家针对这些缺点继续进行技术改造。经过改造，又实现了生产流水化，二十多人一天就能灌四十多立方。这时，是不是像一些人所说的“可真差不多了”呢？当然不是，以后经过工人苦心钻研，又进一步实现了灌造联动化，在提高工作效率一倍、减人50％的基础上，又节约了80％的劳动力。
    另一个问题，是大抓整体观念教育，反对本位主义思想。我们知道，人是生产力的决定性因素，因而做好节约劳动力的工作，力求用较少的人力创造更多的物质财富，不仅是一个企业必须经常做好的重要工作，而且是高速度地发展国民经济的决定性环节。我们又知道，事物都是互相联系的，国民经济的各个部门，一个工厂的各个车间和工段，是一个不可分割的整体，如果工业占用的劳动力过多，农业劳动力就必然减少；在一个工厂内，如果这个车间或工段占用的劳动力过多，别的车间或工段的劳动力就必然减少。因此，为要做好节约劳动力的工作，就既要教育职工懂得人力的可贵，懂得劳动力的浪费是最大的浪费，又要教育职工树立起坚强的整体观念，遇事都能从全厂全国的需要出发来考虑问题。应当说，我厂绝大多数职工是懂得这个道理的，但在节约劳动力的过程中，也碰到了形形色色的本位主义思想，直接影响了抽调劳动力支援农业生产第一线和兄弟单位。为了把节约劳动力的工作搞深搞透，厂党委对职工进行了局部利益必须服从全局利益的整体观念教育，大讲工农业同时并举的方针，大讲全国一盘棋，而且用“新厂不上马，单单老厂的生产能否适应铁路建设的迅速发展？”、“为什么要支援农业？用什么行动支援农业？”为题，组织全厂职工大鸣大放大辩论。厂党委为了使职工比较深刻地认识本位主义的害处，又用轨枕车间的事实教育全厂职工。这个车间由于打破了本位主义思想，加强了协作，又改进了劳动组织，就由年初的五百人降到三百人左右，而生产任务完成得仍然很好。这使职工受到了一次生动而又深刻的教育，许多车间干部和工人都以轨枕车间为镜子，检查了自己的本位主义思想，树立了坚强的整体观念，因而节约劳动力和抽调干部的工作都进行得比较顺利。
