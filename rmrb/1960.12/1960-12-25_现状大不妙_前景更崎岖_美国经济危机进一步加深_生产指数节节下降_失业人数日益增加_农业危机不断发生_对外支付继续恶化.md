Xinhua News Agency, New York, 23rd dispatch: Materials published by the American government and bourgeois newspapers indicate that the American economic crisis is further deteriorating.

According to the U.S. government, the U.S. industrial production index for November has fallen to 105 (with the 1957 average as 100), a decrease of two points from October and six points from January. Since December, U.S. industrial production has continued to be sluggish. According to *U.S. News & World Report*, compared with the same period in November, the U.S. industrial production index for the week ending December 12 fell by another point, steel production fell by about 10%, electricity production fell by about 1%, freight train loadings fell by about 5%, paper production fell by about 8%, and automobile production decreased by more than 36,000 vehicles. In the construction industry, the number of new buildings in November decreased by 5% compared to October. According to the magazine, due to overproduction, factories' old and new orders are decreasing, and "there is no sign that industrial production will rise in the near future."

Corporate investment is also decreasing. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. corporate investment in the second quarter of this year was $36.3 billion, falling to $35.9 billion in the third quarter, and further to $35.6 billion in the fourth quarter. Some American newspapers estimate that U.S. corporate investment will decline even more next year. For example, businesses in the Pennsylvania area are now preparing to reduce their investment next year by 20% compared to this year. At the same time, according to American newspapers, due to deteriorating sales, U.S. companies' pre-tax profits in the third quarter of this year decreased by $6 billion compared to the first quarter and $3 billion compared to the second quarter. The number of newly established enterprises has recently decreased significantly, while the number of bankruptcies among small and medium-sized enterprises has been steadily increasing.

As production continues to shrink, the number of unemployed people in the United States is surging. In November, the number of fully unemployed people in the United States exceeded four million. *Business Week* estimates that by the beginning of next year, it will increase to more than 5.5 million to 6 million. Due to the surge in the unemployed population, the total wages of American factories in November decreased by $700 million compared to October.

American agriculture is also deeply mired in crisis. The U.S. Information Service acknowledged in a message on the 15th that under the impact of the crisis, a large number of farmers have embarked on the road to bankruptcy. The U.S. official news agency said, "In the past five years, the number of American farms has decreased rapidly... Many small and unprofitable farms have disappeared."

America's foreign payment crisis continues to develop. The U.S. government announced yesterday that in the third quarter of this year, the U.S. foreign payment deficit was $4.1 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion from the second quarter. At the same time, America's gold continues to flow out in large quantities. In the week ending December 22, America's gold outflowed another $48 million.

Faced with these relentless facts, the American economic community has expressed concern about the continued deterioration of the American economic crisis. United Press International said in a message on the 22nd, "Except for a small handful of conservative die-hards, most American entrepreneurs now unanimously believe that the United States has entered a recession," and the future looks "arduous." *Business Week* also said on the 17th, "The U.S. economy is indeed in a recession, and this recession is getting worse."

    现状大不妙　前景更崎岖
    美国经济危机进一步加深
    生产指数节节下降　　失业人数日益增加
    农业危机不断发生　　对外支付继续恶化
    新华社23日讯　纽约消息：美国政府和资产阶级报刊发表的一些材料说明，美国经济危机正在进一步恶化。
    据美国政府宣布，在11月份，美国的工业生产指数已经下降到一百零五（1957年的平均数为一百），即比10月份的水平下降了两点，比1月份的水平下降了六点。12月份以来，美国工业生产继续不振。据《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志报道，同11月份同期比较，美国的工业生产指数在12月12日结束的一周又下降了一点，钢铁生产指标则下降了约10％，电力生产指标下降了约1％，火车货运量指标下降了约5％，造纸业生产指标下降了约8％，小汽车生产量减少了三万六千多辆。在建筑业方面，11月份的新建筑数目比10月份减少5％。据这家杂志说，由于生产过剩，工厂的旧订货单和新订货单都在减少，“现在还没有迹象说明工业生产今后不久将会上升”。
    企业投资也在减少。据美国商务部宣布，在今年第二季，美国企业投资数目为三百六十三亿美元，第三季下降到三百五十九亿美元，第四季再下降到三百五十六亿美元。美国一些报刊估计，到明年，美国的企业投资还将下降得更多，像宾夕法尼亚地区的企业，现在就准备把明年的投资比今年减少20％。同时据美国报刊说，由于销售情况恶化，美国公司纳税前的利润在今年第三季比第一季减少了六十亿美元，比第二季减少了三十亿美元。新开办的企业最近已经显著减少，而中小企业的破产数目则不断增加。
    随着生产不断缩减，美国失业人数正在激增。在11月份，美国全失业的人数已超过四百万人。《商业周刊》估计，到明年年初将增加到五百五十万到六百万人以上。由于失业人口激增，11月份美国工厂的工资总额比10月份减少了七亿美元。
    美国的农业也深深地陷在危机中。美国新闻处15日在一条消息里承认，在危机的打击下，大批农民已走上了破产的道路。这家美国官方通讯社说，“在过去五年中，美国农场的数目就减少得很快……许多小的获利不大的农场都消失了。”
    美国的对外支付危机也在继续发展着。美国政府昨天宣布，在今年第三季，美国的对外支付赤字为四十一亿美元，比第二季激增十三亿美元。同时美国的黄金继续在大量外流。在12月22日结束的一周，美国的黄金又外流了四千八百万美元。
    面对着这些无情的事实，美国经济界对美国的经济危机继续恶化纷纷表示不安。合众国际社22日在一条消息中说，“除了一小撮保守的死硬派以外，美国大多数企业家现在已一致认为美国已发生衰退”，而且看来前景“崎岖”。《商业周刊》17日也说，“美国经济确是处在衰退中，而且这个衰退还在日益恶化”。
