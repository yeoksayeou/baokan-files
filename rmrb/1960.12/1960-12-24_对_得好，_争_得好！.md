“Fighting” Well, “Striving” Well!
    Lin Xu

    The two revolutionary memoirs, *Fighting Tit-for-Tat, Striving for Every Inch of Land* and *The Battle of Counterattack on Yetai Mountain*, jointly illustrate one point: the aggressive nature of reactionaries will never change, and the only way to deal with them is to give them a taste of their own medicine.

    The people have always yearned for peace. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, how eagerly did the Chinese people hope to heal the wounds, rebuild their homes, and live a happy life in peaceful days! It is entirely understandable how joyful people must have been when a glimmer of peace appeared in the sky. However, history has repeatedly told us that the people's desire for peace cannot change the reactionary's nature of resolutely opposing the people. A thief is always going to steal; a wolf is always going to eat people. Chiang Kai-shek and his gang of extremely cruel and insidious reactionaries will never give up their ambition to trample on the people under any circumstances, and they will never forget to eliminate the people's revolutionary forces even in their dreams. It is absolutely impossible to live in the same house with jackals and not be vigilant. At the end of the Anti-Japanese War, Comrade Mao Zedong, on the one hand, made the greatest efforts to strive for domestic peace, and on the other hand, issued a warning: "The danger of civil war is very serious, because Chiang Kai-shek's policy has been decided. According to Chiang Kai-shek's policy, he wants to fight a civil war. According to our policy, the people's policy, we do not want to fight a civil war. ... If both sides do not want to fight, the war will not break out. Now only one side does not want to fight, and the strength of this side is not enough to stop the other side, so the danger of civil war is very serious." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume IV, pp. 1125, 1126)

    Sure enough. When the people were using a just war to eliminate the Japanese invading army, Chiang Kai-shek stayed deep in Mount Emei, stood idly by, waited for victory, preserved his strength, and prepared for civil war; when the War of Resistance against Japan was won and the people urgently needed peace, this "Emei Hermit" wanted to "descend the mountain" to seize the fruits of victory and meticulously launch a civil war. The Battle of Yetai Mountain took place on July 21, 1945, on the eve of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, in Chunhua County, Guanzhong Sub-district of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. The enemy's method was to concentrate the forces of six divisions to launch a sudden attack on us. The battles of Yanggao in Northern Shanxi and Fengzhen and Jining in Eastern Sui took place on January 13, 1946, a few hours before the armistice agreement came into effect, again in our liberated areas. The enemy's method was again to take advantage of our unpreparedness, launch a surprise attack, seize strategic points, and create a fait accompli. How thoroughly were the ferocious faces and conspiracies of the reactionaries exposed in these two battles.

    All reactionaries are accustomed to playing such tricks: when they talk highly about national interests and people's interests, they are actually engaged in treason and dictatorial crimes; when they talk highly about peace and stopping the war, they are actually actively preparing to undermine peace and launch anti-people wars. The two battles of Yetai Mountain and Fengzhen and Jining, although different in time, place, and objective situation, and although the enemy's specific tactics and specific methods were different, all proved that the insidious and vicious class nature of the reactionaries would not change in the slightest. Their reactionary essence determined their reactionary policy, which is "every inch of power must be seized, every bit of profit must be gained." In order to seize power and gain profit, the reactionaries adopted methods of either military suppression or peaceful deception. When they thought there was power to be seized or profit to be gained, they frantically adopted military suppression; when they thought it was necessary to release smoke screens, they used clever words and flowery language to carry out peaceful deception. The enemy always thought things were very beautiful. They thought that by capturing Yetai Mountain and carrying out military suppression in the liberated areas, they could intimidate the people; they thought that by releasing a smokescreen of fake peace and then seizing our strategic points, they could catch the people off guard. However, these wishful calculations were wrong. No matter how the enemy intimidates or deceives, the people will neither be intimidated nor fooled. In the end, it is still the stupid enemies who will fail.

    Why? Because Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the nature of the reactionaries and the counter-revolutionary conspiracies and tricks they adopted, put forward a thorough revolutionary strategy and line, which is: "Fight tit-for-tat, strive for every inch of land," and use revolutionary dual tactics to deal with counter-revolutionary dual tactics. Chairman Mao said: "We are acting according to Chiang Kai-shek's method. Chiang Kai-shek always wants to force the people to accept war, he holds a knife in his left hand and a knife in his right hand. We will follow his method and pick up knives as well." "Now Chiang Kai-shek is already sharpening his knife, so we must also sharpen our knife." "If they want to fight, wipe them out completely. That's how it is. If he attacks, we wipe him out, and he will be comfortable. Eliminate a little, be a little more comfortable, eliminate a lot, be a lot more comfortable, eliminate completely, be completely comfortable. ... If we do not inflict a major blow on the reactionaries who dare to attack the liberated areas, peace will not come." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume IV, pp. 1126, 1127, 1158) In the counterattack on Yetai Mountain and the counterattacks in the Fengzhen and Jining areas, our army conducted a tit-for-tat struggle against the enemy precisely according to Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions. "We 'fought,' we 'strived,' and we 'fought' very well, and 'strived' very well." The lost places were recovered, and the invading enemy was completely wiped out.

    The two revolutionary memoirs also narrate a common fact: under the guise of "mediating the military conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party," American imperialism tried every possible means to find excuses for the Kuomintang reactionaries to launch a civil war, and strengthened the aggressive forces of the United States in China and the aggressive position of the Kuomintang reactionaries in all aspects. However, under the tit-for-tat struggle of the Chinese people, all these tricks were completely defeated.

    We do not object to the enemy wanting to sit down and negotiate, because the people have always loved peace. However, we must expose the enemy's use of negotiations to cover up its reactionary military actions; the enemy's attempt to harm the fundamental interests of the people through negotiations will never succeed. Faced with an enemy holding a knife, we must raise our revolutionary vigilance a thousandfold; since the enemy's counter-revolutionary war has been launched, we can only use revolutionary war to defeat the enemy and eliminate the enemy!

### “对”得好，“争”得好！

    “对”得好，“争”得好！
    林旭
    《针锋相对，寸土必争》和《爷台山反击战》两篇革命回忆录，共同说明了一个问题：反动派的侵略本性是永远不会改变的，对付反动派的唯一办法，只能是以其人之道，还治其人之身。
    人民从来都渴望着和平。抗日战争胜利了，我国人民多么迫切地希望在和平的日子里恢复创伤，重建家园，安度幸福的生活！完全可以理解，当着天空中出现了一线和平曙光的时候，人们的心情该是怎样的欢欣鼓舞。然而，历史却一再地告诉我们：人民的和平愿望，丝毫也改变不了反动派坚决与人民为敌的本性。是贼，总是要偷东西；是狼，总是要吃人。蒋介石这一帮极端残忍、阴险的反动派，在任何时候和任何情况下，都不会放弃他们践踏人民的野心，就是作梦也忘不了要消灭人民的革命力量。和豺狼住在一个房子里，不警惕，那是万万不行的。在抗日战争刚刚结束的时候，毛泽东同志一方面尽了最大的努力，争取实现国内和平，一方面发出警告说：“内战危险是十分严重的，因为蒋介石的方针已经定了。按照蒋介石的方针，是要打内战的。按照我们的方针，人民的方针，是不要打内战的。……一个不要打，一个要打。如果两方面都不要打，就打不起来。现在不要打的只是一个方面，并且这一方面的力量又还不足以制止那一方面，所以内战危险就十分严重。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷第1125、1126页）
    果然不错。当着人民用正义的战争去消灭日本侵略军队的时候，蒋介石深居峨嵋山，袖手旁观，等待胜利，保存实力，准备内战；当着抗战胜利，人民迫切需要和平的时候，这个“峨嵋隐士”，却要“下山”来抢夺胜利果实，处心积虑地发动内战了。爷台山之战，时间是1945年7月21日抗日战争胜利的前夕，地点是我陕甘宁边区关中分区的淳化县，敌人的手段是集中六个师的兵力向我突然袭击。晋北阳高和绥东丰镇、集宁一战，时间是1946年1月13日停战协定生效前的几小时，地点又是我解放区，敌人的手段则又是乘我不备，突然袭击，抢夺战略要点，造成既成事实。这两仗，反动派的狰狞面目，阴谋诡计暴露得多么淋漓尽致。
    一切反动派都惯于玩弄这样的花招：当着他们高谈民族利益、人民利益的时候，实际上他们在干着卖国、独裁的罪恶勾当；当着他们高谈和平、停止战争的时候，实际上他们却在积极准备破坏和平、发动反人民的战争。爷台山和丰镇、集宁的两次战斗，尽管时间不同，地点不同，客观的形势不同，尽管敌人的具体策略、具体作法不同，然而都证明了反动派阴险狠毒的阶级本性丝毫也不会改变。他们的反动本质确定了反动的方针，那就是“寸权必夺，寸利必得”。为了夺权得利，反动派采用的方法不是军事镇压，就是和平欺骗。当他们认为有权可夺，有利可得的时机，就疯狂地采取军事镇压的手段；当他们认为需要施放烟幕的时候，就巧言花语地进行和平欺骗。敌人总是把事情想得非常美妙，他们以为攻下爷台山，对解放区实行军事镇压，就可以吓倒人民；他们以为，放出假和平的烟幕，然后抢占我战略要点，就可以攻人民于不备。但是，这些如意算盘是打错了。任凭敌人恐吓也好，欺骗也好，人民是既不会吓倒，也不会上当的。到头来，失败的还是那些愚蠢的敌人。
    为什么？因为毛泽东同志根据反动派的本性和它所采取的反革命的阴谋诡计，提出了彻底革命的策略路线，这就是：“针锋相对，寸土必争”，用革命的两手对付反革命的两手。毛主席说：“我们是按照蒋介石的办法办事。蒋介石总是要强迫人民接受战争，他左手拿着刀，右手也拿着刀。我们就按照他的办法，也拿起刀来。”“现在蒋介石已经在磨刀了，因此，我们也要磨刀。”“如果他们要打，就把他们彻底消灭。事情就是这样，他来进攻，我们把他消灭了，他就舒服了。消灭一点，舒服一点，消灭得多，舒服得多，彻底消灭，彻底舒服。……不给敢于进攻解放区的反动派很大的打击，和平是不会来的。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷第1126、1127、1158页）爷台山反击战和丰镇、集宁一带的反击战，我军正是根据毛主席的英明指示与敌人进行了针锋相对的斗争。“我们‘对’了，‘争’了，而且‘对’得很好，‘争’得很好”。失去的地方收复了，进犯的敌人被彻底消灭了。
    两篇革命回忆录中，还叙述了一个共同的事实：美帝国主义在“调解国共军事冲突”的幌子下，千方百计地为国民党反动派发动内战寻找借口，从各方面加强美国在华的侵略势力和国民党反动派的侵略地位。然而，在中国人民针锋相对的斗争下，所有这些鬼把戏全盘皆输。
    敌人愿意坐下来谈判，我们并不反对，因为人民从来是热爱和平的。但是，敌人用谈判来掩饰它的反动的军事行动，我们必须拆穿；敌人企图通过谈判来损害人民的基本利益，万万办不到。面对着拿刀的敌人，我们必须千百倍地提高自己的革命警惕；敌人的反革命战争既然发动了，我们也只有用革命的战争，把敌人击败，把敌人消灭！
