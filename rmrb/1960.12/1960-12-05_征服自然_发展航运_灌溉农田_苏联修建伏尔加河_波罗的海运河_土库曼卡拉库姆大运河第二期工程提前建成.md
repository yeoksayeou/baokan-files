    Conquering Nature, Developing Shipping, Irrigating Farmland
    The Soviet Union Builds the Volga-Baltic Waterway
    Second Phase of the Turkmen Kara Kum Canal Completed Ahead of Schedule
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, according to the Soviet "Economic News," a canal linking the Baltic Sea and the Volga River is under construction and is a major canal project in the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965).
    The total length of this new waterway is 361 kilometers, exceeding the White Sea-Baltic Canal, the Moscow Canal, and the Volga-Don Canal.
    The route of this canal passes through the watershed of the Volga River system and the Northwest water system. It starts near the city of Vytegra in the southern part of Lake Onega, passes through the Vytegra River, the Kovzha River, Lake Beloye, the Sheksna River, and ends at the city of Cherepovets in the northern part of the Rybinsk Reservoir.
    After the completion of this new waterway, the unified deep-water shipping system in the European part of the Soviet Union will be basically completed. Large ships on the Volga River can travel unimpeded to Leningrad, Petrozavodsk, and the ports of the Baltic and White Seas. After the canal opens to navigation, Leningrad will become the largest river port in the Soviet Union, and the volume of goods transported by water will increase by 60%-85%. Grain and petroleum products from the Volga River and coal from Pechora can be transported to the north through this canal. Timber and chemical products can be transported south via this route. The sailing time from Cherepovets to Leningrad will be shortened by more than half, and the freight will be two-thirds lower than railway transport.
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, according to Soviet newspapers: The second phase of the Kara Kum Canal project in the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic has been completed ahead of schedule. A water release ceremony was held recently, and the river water has flowed into the Tejen River. The second phase of the canal project runs from the Murghab River to the Tejen River, with a total length of 139 kilometers. So far, the total length of the Kara Kum Canal has reached more than 540 kilometers.
    The first phase of the Kara Kum Canal project starts from the left bank of the Amu Darya River a few kilometers from the Soviet-Afghan border. The Kara Kum Desert is located in the eastern part of the Caspian Sea and covers an area of hundreds of thousands of square kilometers. The Kara Kum Desert is one of the largest deserts in the world, accounting for about four-fifths of the area of the Turkmen Republic.
    According to initial calculations, the second phase of the project would take four years to complete. This spring, the Turkmen Republic decided to treat the second phase of the project as a civil project, with collective farms contributing their own manpower and financial resources, and the state providing necessary assistance, in order to speed up the project.
    This phase of the project started in mid-April, and the plan stipulated that it should be completed in eight months, but thanks to the efforts of the masses, it was completed nearly two months ahead of schedule, that is, within six months. During these six months, a total of 19 million cubic meters of earthwork were excavated, and 10,000 cubic meters of reinforced concrete were poured.
    This canal can put approximately 130,000 hectares of fertile wasteland into agricultural production during this seven-year plan, and irrigate millions of hectares of pastures. The Tejen River basin is an important cotton-producing area in Turkmenistan. This area is very short of water. After the completion of the second phase of the canal project, cotton fields alone can be expanded by 45,000 hectares. The state can also develop rich underground treasures here, and the canal is also an important transportation line in the border area.
    The conditions for this phase of the project were very difficult. There were no roads in the desert, there was a serious shortage of water, and it was also necessary to cross grassland dunes that were more than 20 meters high, but the selfless builders still overcame various difficulties and successfully completed this project ahead of schedule at a speed rarely seen in past water conservancy construction. During the construction process, 29 engineering teams also launched a competition to win the title of Communist Labor Team. (Attached picture)

### 征服自然　发展航运　灌溉农田  苏联修建伏尔加河——波罗的海运河  土库曼卡拉库姆大运河第二期工程提前建成

    征服自然　发展航运　灌溉农田
    苏联修建伏尔加河——波罗的海运河
    土库曼卡拉库姆大运河第二期工程提前建成
    新华社莫斯科电　据苏联《经济报》报道，联系波罗的海和伏尔加河的运河正在修建中，这是苏联七年计划（1959年—1965年）中的一项主要运河工程。
    这条新航路的总长达三百六十一公里，超过了白海—波罗的海运河、莫斯科运河和伏尔加河—顿河运河。
    这条运河的线路通过伏尔加河水系和西北水系的分水地带，它从奥涅加湖南部的维帖格拉城附近开始，经过维帖格拉河、科夫热河、白湖、舍克斯那河，到律平斯克水库北部的切列波维次城为止。
    这条新航道建成以后，苏联欧洲部分的统一深水航运系统将基本上建成。伏尔加河上的大轮船可以畅行无阻地驶到列宁格勒、彼得罗萨佛德斯克以及波罗的海和白海的各港口。这条运河通航后，列宁格勒将成为苏联最大的河港，从水路运来的货物量将增加60％—85％。从伏尔加河来的粮食和石油产品、彼乔拉的煤都可通过这条运河运到北方。木材化学产品可经此运往南方。从切列波维次到列宁格勒的航行时间将缩短一半以上，而运费可比铁路运输低三分之二。
    据新华社莫斯科电　据苏联报纸报道：苏联土库曼共和国卡拉库姆运河第二期工程已提前完工。最近举行了放水仪式，河水已滚滚流入帖振河。第二期运河工程从木耳加布河到帖振河，全长一百三十九公里。至此卡拉库姆运河总长已达五百四十多公里。
    卡拉库姆运河第一期工程从阿穆河左岸距苏联—阿富汗边境数公里的地方开始。卡拉库姆位于里海东部，面积达数十万平方公里。卡拉库姆大沙漠是世界最大沙漠之一，它占土库曼共和国面积大约五分之四。
    第二期工程根据最初计算需要四年时间才能完成，今年春天土库曼共和国决定将第二期工程作为民办工程，由集体农庄自己出人力、财力来兴建，国家给以必要帮助，以加快工程速度。
    这期工程从4月中旬开始，计划规定缩短为八个月完成，但由于群众的努力，又提前了将近两个月，即在六个月的时间内就完工了。在这六个月时间内一共挖掘了一千九百万土方，浇灌了一万立方的钢筋混凝土。
    这条运河在这个七年计划中就可以使约十三万公顷肥沃的荒地投入农业生产，并灌溉数百万公顷的牧场。帖振河流域是土库曼重要的产棉区。这个地区非常缺水。运河第二期工程完成后，光是棉田就可以扩大四万五千公顷。国家还可以在这里开发丰富的地下宝藏，运河还是边区的一条重要的交通线。
    这期工程进行的条件是很艰苦的，沙漠中既没有道路，又严重缺水，还要越过高达二十米以上的草原砂丘，但是忘我的建设者们仍然克服了种种困难，以过去水利建设中很少有过的速度，胜利地提前完成了这一工程。在建筑过程中，二十九个工程队还展开了争取共产主义劳动队称号的竞赛。（附图片）
