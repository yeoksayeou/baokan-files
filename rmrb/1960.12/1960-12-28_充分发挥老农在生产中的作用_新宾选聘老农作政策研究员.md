Fully Develop the Role of Experienced Farmers in Production
Xinbin Appoints Experienced Farmers as Policy Researchers

(Our report) The Xinbin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Liaoning Province has recently developed the practice of inviting experienced farmers to act as "advisors" in leading agricultural production. It has formally selected and appointed a group of advanced experienced farmers as "policy researchers" for the county committee, to serve as assistants in the county committee's research and implementation of the Party's guidelines and policies, and in guiding agricultural production.

Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, leading cadres of the Xinbin County Committee, in the process of adhering to the principle of going deep into the front line of agricultural production, participating in production, and leading production, have adopted various forms such as extensively befriending experienced farmers, establishing "experienced farmer advisory points," holding various professional symposiums for experienced farmers, and combining leading cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians to cultivate experimental fields. This has solved many key problems in production. In September of this year, the county committee, based on summing up the past experience in leveraging the role of experienced farmers, selected and appointed one experienced farmer from among the poor and lower-middle peasants in each commune who was politically reliable, ideologically advanced, had rich production experience and a certain ability to analyze, and was courageous in expressing their opinions, as a "policy researcher" for the county committee. In this way, the leadership can fully absorb the production experience of experienced farmers, making the leadership of agricultural production more specific and practical; it also enables experienced farmers to learn the Party's policies in a timely manner, improve their policy understanding, and better play their role. In order to better learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, the county committee has made appropriate arrangements for the work and study of the "experienced farmer policy researchers," enabling them to grasp the spirit of the Party's policies in a timely manner as a measure for observing and handling problems.

In the past two months, through the experienced farmers bringing knowledge down to the masses and bringing problems and suggestions back up, the Party's policy requirements have been better grasped by the masses, becoming a driving force for promoting production. For example, after veteran farmer researcher Lu Jinghe studied the autumn harvest instructions of the Provincial Party Committee and the County Party Committee in the county, he went to the Matanggou Production Team of Xinbin Town Commune to inspect the autumn harvest and found that the autumn harvest operations were rough. He publicized to the commune members the principles of the Provincial Party Committee and the County Party Committee regarding the need to firmly grasp the "clean" aspect of this year's autumn harvest, and conducted an on-the-spot demonstration of harvesting crops without losing grain, which immediately improved the ideological understanding and harvesting quality of the commune members. After Lu Jinghe returned to the county, he reported the problems and rectification methods discovered in the Matanggou Production Team to the county committee, which received great attention from the county committee. The county committee immediately called each commune, requesting attention to correcting the phenomenon of rough autumn harvesting. The county committee also introduced to all the communes in the county the operating methods proposed by Lu Jinghe in the Matanggou Production Team to ensure harvesting without loss of grain, which played a significant role in completing the autumn harvest tasks quickly and cleanly throughout the county.

The "experienced farmer policy researchers" come from among the masses, are most familiar with production, and understand the psychology of the masses best. Every time they arrive in a place, they immediately immerse themselves in production and among the masses, quickly finding out the thinking of the masses and the problems existing in actual work, and quickly and easily conveying the Party's policies to the masses.

Because the "experienced farmer policy researchers" follow the county leading cadres to the countryside to understand the actual situation, pay close attention to farming seasons, and are good at considering and arranging production according to the seasons, they effectively help the leadership move forward step by step, better and more specifically leading agricultural production. For example, based on the new situation that some areas of the county suffered severe floods this year, in order to prepare for next year's production and win a bumper harvest in agriculture next year, the experienced farmer policy researchers, together with the cadres of the County Party Committee Office, jointly proposed three measures: First, the farmland water conservancy projects destroyed by floods this year must strive to repair a portion this winter to prevent too much farm work and insufficient manpower next spring, which would delay the farming season and affect production; second, in production, in addition to paying attention to the combination of work and rest and recuperation for people, we must also pay attention to the combination of work and rest for large livestock, strengthen feeding management, make them gain weight and recover, and safely get through the winter to prepare for large-scale production next year; third, the areas that have suffered from floods have insufficient manure and fertilizer, so more fertilizer must be produced this winter. The county committee has adopted these opinions and has organized special personnel to make arrangements. Some have already formulated plans, issued them to the communes, and implemented them immediately.

    充分发挥老农在生产中的作用
    新宾选聘老农作政策研究员
    本报讯　中共辽宁省新宾县委员会最近发展了在领导农业生产上请老农当“顾问”的作法，正式选聘一批先进老农为县委的“政策研究员”，作为县委研究贯彻党的方针政策和指导农业生产的助手。
    从1958年大跃进以来，新宾县委的领导干部在坚持深入农业生产第一线、参加生产领导生产的过程中，采取了和老农广泛交朋友、建立“老农顾问点”、召开各种老农专业座谈会和领导干部、老农、技术员三结合种试验田等形式，解决了许多生产中的关键问题。今年9月，县委在总结了过去发挥老农作用的基础上，在每个公社中选聘一名政治可靠、思想先进、有丰富的生产经验和一定的分析能力、并勇于发表自己意见的贫下中农中的老农先进分子作为县委的“政策研究员”。这样，领导上既充分吸收老农的生产经验，使对农业生产的领导更加具体更加切合实际；又使老农及时学习党的政策，提高他们的政策水平，更好地发挥老农的作用。为了更好地互相取长补短，县委对“老农政策研究员”的工作和学习做了妥当的安排。使“老农政策研究员”能够及时地掌握党的政策精神，作为观察和处理问题的尺度。
    两个月来，通过老农带下去，带上来，使党的政策要求更好地为群众所掌握，成为推动生产的动力。如老农研究员鲁景和在县里学习了省委、县委的秋收指示以后，到新宾镇公社马塘沟生产队检查秋收，发现秋收作业粗糙，向社员宣传了省委、县委关于今年秋收必须狠抓“净”字的道理，并且当场进行了割庄稼不损失粮食的实地操作表演，立即提高了社员的思想认识和收获质量。鲁景和回县后，把在马塘沟生产队发现的问题和纠正的方法向县委作了汇报，受到县委的很大重视。县委立即打电话给各公社要求注意纠正秋收粗糙现象。县委并且根据鲁景和在马塘沟生产队研究提出的保证收割不损失粮食的操作方法，向全县各公社作了介绍，对全县又快又净地完成秋收任务起了很大作用。
    “老农政策研究员”来自群众之中，最熟悉生产，最了解群众的心理。每到一地马上就扎到生产中去、扎到群众中去，既能很快地摸清群众的思想和实际工作中存在的问题，又能浅显易懂地把党的政策很快地交给群众。
    由于“老农政策研究员”随县领导干部下乡，了解实际情况，十分注意农时，善于按季节考虑安排生产，从而有效地帮助领导上走上步看下步，更好更具体地领导农业生产。例如，根据今年县里部分地区遭受严重水灾的新情况，为搞好明年生产准备，夺取明年农业大丰收，老农政策研究员同县委办公室干部共同研究提出三项措施：一、今年被洪水冲毁了的农田水利工程，必须争取时间在今冬抢修一部分，以防明春农活过多、人力少，违误农时，影响生产；二、在生产上除了注意人的劳逸结合和休养生息以外，还必须注意大牲畜的劳逸结合，加强饲养管理，使之增膘复壮，安全过冬，给明年大生产做好准备；三、遭受水灾的地方粪肥不足，今冬必须多搞一些肥料。这些意见县委都已采纳，已分别组织专人进行安排。有的并已制订出方案，下达公社，立即执行了。
