Anderson's Pilgrimage to the West for Alms
Tian Ma Poem, Jiang Fan Picture

Seeing disaster looming,
Begging his allied brothers for help,
Ordered by his boss,
He must take a trip to Western Europe!

 一一馬 First stop Bonn,
His allied brother snorted:
"Your Excellency comes here for alms,
Mistaking me for the God of Wealth.
Although I have some wealth,
How can I compare to Paris and London.
The U.S. dollar is greatly devalued,
Blame yourself for not knowing how to manage,
Asking me to 'bleed' for help,
That is absolutely impossible!"

二 Second, he left Bonn for Paris,
This allied brother harbored resentment:
"You only seek me out when you're in trouble,
You always looked down on me before.
You’ve requested equality several times,
But elder brother simply ignored me!"
The matter of seeking alms can wait,
Let’s discuss leadership position…
Smiling gleefully at your misfortune,
Taking advantage of your crisis!

三 Third, leaving Paris dejectedly,
Headed to London with a drooping head.
The allied brother looked annoyed upon seeing him,
Forcing a smile to express welcome.
"Elder brother's days are not good,
Brother expresses deep sympathy,
Helpless to assist, please forgive me,
My own difficulties are not light either.
Only blame West Germany for being heartless,
They shouldn't have given you the cold shoulder!"

Going there full of enthusiasm,
Returning empty-handed!
The boss glared angrily,
And flew into a rage!
Anderson is useless,
All the allies are fighting internally,
What difficult brothers and brothers in need,
When disaster strikes, each goes their own way!

    安德逊西游化缘记
    天马诗  江帆画眼见大难临头，乞求盟弟相救，奉了老板之命，且往西欧走走！一一马先奔波恩，盟弟鼻子哼哼：阁下到此化缘，把我错当财神。咱虽薄有资财，哪及巴黎伦敦。美元大大贬值，怪你不会经营，要我“放血”相救，那是万万不能！二别了波恩到巴黎，这个盟弟有怨气：今天有难方找我，从前对我看不起。几次要求平起坐，盟兄干脆就不理！化缘事儿且休提，领导地位议一议。…幸灾乐祸笑嘻嘻，乘人之危打主意！三离开巴黎倍伤神，垂头丧气到伦敦。盟弟一见添烦恼，脸上堆笑表欢迎。盟兄日子不好过，兄弟万分表同情，爱莫能助请原谅，自家困难也不轻。只怪西德无情义，不该饗你闭门羹！去时兴致冲冲，回来两手空空！老板怒目相视，大发脾气一通！安德逊不中用，众盟友起内哄，什么难兄和难弟，大难来时各西东！（附图片）握手言欢签名留念脱帽致敬
