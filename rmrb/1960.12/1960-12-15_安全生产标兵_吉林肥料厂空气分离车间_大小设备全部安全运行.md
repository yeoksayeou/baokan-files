Xinhua News Agency, Changchun Telegram: The workers of the air separation workshop of Jilin Fertilizer Plant have adopted a method combining mechanical repair, electrical work, and chemical engineering. Through regular inspection and maintenance of equipment, all equipment, large and small, has been operating safely for the past year, and they have been rated as a model for equipment maintenance and safe production by Jilin Chemical Company.

The workers in this workshop clearly recognize that doing a good job in equipment maintenance and repair and ensuring the safe operation of equipment are important conditions for completing production tasks. They organized a team combining mechanical repair, electrical work, and chemical engineering for equipment maintenance and repair. They regularly and comprehensively inspect equipment, formulate maintenance plans, and also "seize every opportunity" to organize forces to rush repairs. Therefore, they have been able to both avoid affecting normal production and complete maintenance tasks according to plan.

The combination of mechanical repair, electrical work, and chemical engineering in equipment maintenance requires repair workers and production workers to be familiar with each other's business. The workshop's Party branch actively cultivates workers in mechanics, electricity, and chemistry to become all-rounders, enabling them to cooperate in the maintenance and repair of equipment. Whenever urgent repairs are needed for a piece of equipment, the workshop concentrates the strength of mechanics, electricity, and chemistry to carry out the task. During routine maintenance, production workers repair some minor repair items themselves, so as not to affect production. In order to closely integrate the three trades of mechanics, electricity, and chemistry in maintaining equipment, the workshop has also established equipment files. After each maintenance, they carefully make assessments and record the situation in detail in the equipment files for later reference during maintenance, upkeep, and use. In addition, the workshop also paid special attention to the manufacture of spare parts. For some parts that are prone to wear and tear, they rely on their own efforts to process and manufacture them in advance as much as possible to prepare for maintenance needs.

    安全生产标兵——吉林肥料厂空气分离车间
    大小设备全部安全运行
    新华社长春电　吉林肥料厂空气分离车间职工，采取机修、电气、化工三结合方法，经常检修维护设备，一年来大小设备全部安全运行，被吉林化学公司评为设备维护检修和安全生产的标兵。
    这个车间的职工都明确认识到做好设备维护和检修、保证设备安全运行，是完成生产任务的重要条件。他们组织了机修、电气、化工三结合设备维护、检修小组，定期全面地检查设备，制订检修计划，并且“见缝插针”，随时组织力量，突击抢修。因此做到了既不影响生产正常进行，又能按计划完成检修任务。
    机修、电气、化工三结合维护检修设备，要求检修工人和生产工人互相熟悉业务。车间党支部积极培养机、电、化三方面工人成为多面手，使他们在维护与检修设备中合力协作。每当需要突击检修一项设备时，车间就集中机、电、化三方面力量全力进行。平时检修中，对于一些小的检修项目，生产工人就自行修理，不致因此影响生产。为使机、电、化三个工种密切结合维护设备，车间还建立了设备档案。他们每次检修完毕，都认真做鉴定，把情况详细记录下来列入设备档案，供后来检修、维护、使用时参考。此外，车间还特别注意了制造备品备件的工作，对于一些易于磨损的部件，都依靠自己力量尽量提前加工制造，以备检修需要。
