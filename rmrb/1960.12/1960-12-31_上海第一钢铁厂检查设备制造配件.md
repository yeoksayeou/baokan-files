Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai - The Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, through inspecting the plant's main equipment for steelmaking, steel rolling, etc., has specifically arranged the key maintenance projects for the end of this year and the beginning of next year. A comprehensive arrangement has been made for the spare parts and accessories required for equipment maintenance. Those manufactured by external factories have been linked up and production has begun; those manufactured by the plant itself have plans assigned to workshops and teams and are being processed.

This year, this plant has created many experiences in implementing a work method that combines mass maintenance and professional maintenance. They are currently conscientiously summarizing these experiences in preparation for further promotion in next year's production. The open-hearth furnace workshop, which won the national red flag for small open-hearth furnaces, has done a very good job in mass furnace maintenance this year. They implemented a method where operating workers are also responsible for maintenance and upkeep, treating old furnaces as new ones, inspecting every shift, and maintaining every furnace. This has basically eliminated the phenomenon of long smelting times for furnaces in their early and late stages, and the smelting time for each heat of steel has remained stable within six hours from the start of a new furnace to the late stage of tapping. These experiences are now being gradually incorporated into operating procedures and formalized as systems, so that they can play a greater role in next year's production. The No. 1 converter workshop divided all equipment into six areas, such as pig iron furnaces and converters, with each area jointly responsible for daily equipment maintenance by maintenance workers and operators, with good results. Currently, the workshop's employees are summarizing and enriching this experience in preparation for further application next year.

    上海第一钢铁厂检查设备制造配件
    据新华社上海电  上海第一钢铁厂通过检查全厂炼钢、轧钢等主要设备，具体安排了今年年底、明年年初的重点检修项目。检修设备所需的备品、配件已作了全面安排。由外厂承制的，有的已挂好钩，开始生产；由本厂制造的，计划已落实到车间、小组，正在加工。
    这个厂今年在实行群众性的维护和专业检修相结合的工作中，创造了许多经验，最近正在认真总结，准备在明年生产中进一步推广。获得全国小型平炉红旗的平炉车间，今年群众性的护炉工作做得很好。他们实行操作工人兼管检修维护，老炉子当新炉子护，班班检查、炉炉维护的办法，基本消灭了炉子在青年期和老年期冶炼时间长的现象，每炉钢的冶炼时间从新开炉到晚期打炉一直稳定在六小时以内。现在这些经验已被陆续订入操作规程，形成制度，使它们明年在生产中发挥更大的效果。第一转炉车间把所有设备划分为化铁炉、转炉等六个区域，每个区域由机修工人和操作工人共同负责日常的设备维护工作，效果很好。目前，这个车间的职工正在总结和充实这个经验，准备明年进一步运用。
