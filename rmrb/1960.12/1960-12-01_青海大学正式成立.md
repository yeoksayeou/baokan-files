    Qinghai University Officially Established
    (Our dispatch) Qinghai Province's first comprehensive university, Qinghai University, has been officially established.
    Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, education in Qinghai Province has developed rapidly. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the province has successively established four institutions of higher learning: the Institute of Technology, the Institute of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, the Medical College, and the College of Finance and Economics. In the past few years, these four institutions of higher learning have resolutely implemented the Party's education policy and promoted the fine traditions of building schools through diligence and frugality and hard work. Both the political consciousness of teachers and students, the teaching equipment, and the teaching quality have greatly improved. In order to adapt to the development of the situation and accelerate the training of talents for socialist construction, the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee decided to merge these four institutions of higher learning to establish Qinghai University. The university has a total of more than 3,000 faculty, staff, and students, including more than 2,800 students, more than 500 teaching staff, and more than 200 various other personnel. It has industrial, agricultural and forestry, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, medical, and finance and economics departments, divided into twenty-one majors, making it a multidisciplinary comprehensive university.
    On November 24, Qinghai University faculty and students held a meeting to celebrate the establishment of the school. Gao Feng, First Secretary of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Yuan Renyuan, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Governor of Qinghai Province, and Sun Junyi, Standing Committee Member of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Governor of Qinghai Province, attended the founding conference. Comrade Gao Feng also delivered an important speech at the meeting.
