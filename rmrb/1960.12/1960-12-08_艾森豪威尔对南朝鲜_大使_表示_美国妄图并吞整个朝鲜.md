Xinhua News Agency, Washington, December 6th: U.S. President Eisenhower, when receiving Chang Li-uk, the newly appointed "ambassador" to the United States from the South Korean Chang Myon puppet regime, once again expressed the U.S. imperialist delusion of using South Korea to annex the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Eisenhower, distorting the truth, nonsensically claimed that "the imperialistic communist forces have plunged Korea into its current deplorable state of division." He clamored that the United States will continue to "strive for the peaceful reunification of Korea."

Eisenhower stated that the United States would continue to help South Korea solve the problems it faces in the "spirit of mutual cooperation and understanding" and would continue to be "loyal to its guarantee of maintaining [South Korea's] independence and territorial integrity." When presenting his credentials to Eisenhower, Chang Li-uk said obsequiously that his "government" "fervently hopes" that the United States should regard South Korea as a "loyal ally." Chang Li-uk clamored that his government is "determined to make its best efforts" to continue to fight for "the victory of the ideals of democratic government" in Korea. He emphasized that "this means that we (referring to the Chang Myon puppet regime) must maintain a strong army to defend democratic principles."

    艾森豪威尔对南朝鲜“大使”表示
    美国妄图并吞整个朝鲜
    新华社6日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔5日在接见南朝鲜张勉傀儡政权新任驻美国“大使”张利郁时，再次表示美帝国主义妄想利用南朝鲜来并吞朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。
    艾森豪威尔颠倒黑白地胡说什么“帝国主义的共产主义势力使朝鲜陷于今日可悲的分裂”状态，他叫嚷说，美国将继续为所谓“和平重新统一朝鲜而努力”。
    艾森豪威尔说，美国要继续本着“互相合作和谅解的精神”来帮助南朝鲜解决它面临的问题，并继续“忠于它维护（南朝鲜的）独立和领土完整的保证”。张利郁在向艾森豪威尔呈递国书时，奴颜婢膝地说他的“政府”“热切希望”美国应该把南朝鲜看作是一个“忠诚的盟友”。张利郁叫嚷，他的政府“决心尽最大努力”继续为“使民主政府的理想”在朝鲜取得胜利而战斗。他强调说，“这意味着我们（指张勉傀儡政权）必须保持强大的军队来保卫民主的原则”。
