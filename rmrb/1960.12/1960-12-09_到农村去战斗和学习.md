	Going to the Countryside to Fight and Learn
	Qinghua University, Peking University December 9th Movement History Writing Group
	After the "December 9th" Movement, the student movement in Beiping experienced tremendous development. However, in order to consolidate and perpetuate the developed student movement, and to accelerate its nationwide promotion and expansion of influence; in order to preserve the backbone of the student movement, raise their awareness, and enable them to consciously and forcefully carry out the struggle, the Party promptly pointed out that the students' struggle must be combined with the struggle of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and young students must go to the worker-peasant masses and unite with the main force of the revolution, the workers and peasants. "Go to the countryside," the Party's call immediately turned into a revolutionary action of the masses.
	In late December, the Pingjin Student Union immediately began to organize the "Southward Expansion Propaganda Corps." The "Southward Expansion Propaganda Corps" was divided into four groups. The first group was led by Peking University and included major universities and middle schools in the Dongcheng district; the second group was led by the Beiping University Law and Business College and included major universities and middle schools in the Xicheng and Nancheng districts; the third group was led by Tsinghua University and included Yenching University and Chaoyang University and Fu Jen Catholic University in the Beicheng district; the fourth group was composed of major universities and middle schools in Tianjin. Most of those who participated in the southward propaganda were activists in the "December 9th" Movement, totaling more than five hundred people. They prepared to go south along the Pinghan Railway, first to Gu'an to converge, and then separately to Baoding to concentrate.
	In early January, it was the coldest time in Beiping, with howling winds and dusty skies. The southward propaganda groups, avoiding the ambush of the reactionary military police, set off one after another.
	Late at night, the first group gathered at the Agricultural College outside the city, and then, by the faint starlight, rushed to Fengtai and bypassed Nanyuan. The next day at noon they passed Huangcun and spent the night in Qingyundian. They traveled more than a hundred li in a day and night without rest, enduring cold and hunger. Many students had their feet blistered, but they still gritted their teeth and kept up with the team. Along the way, they also had to be vigilant to avoid the pursuit of military police. They were physically exhausted and mentally tense. Because a hundred or so people suddenly poured into Qingyundian, it was difficult to solve the accommodation problem for a while. Everyone showed the spirit of mutual help and concession, giving the earthen beds to the female students, and the male students sat back to back on the cold ground dozing off. Many female students had legs so swollen that they couldn't even get on the bed. In the hard life, the relationship between the students became closer. The collective care warmed their hearts.
	The day after leaving school, life changed completely. In school, there were warm dormitories, and they ate rice and white flour. But today, it seemed like they had entered another world. Such a long "forced march," sleeping in cold earthen houses, and gnawing on frozen hard pancakes and pickles, was a first for every student. This was the first hurdle to combine with the worker-peasant masses, and it was a severe test. But how could this little pain compare to the pain of the entire nation? To save the disaster-ridden motherland, they were prepared to endure pains a thousand times greater, and even to contribute their own lives.
	The deeper the night, the colder the weather. Some students couldn't sleep and hummed patriotic songs in a low voice towards the boundless darkness. The students' thoughts were like the ocean, surging. They thought about the fighting tomorrow: How to do propaganda? The peasants are illiterate, will propaganda be effective?
	After setting off southward, some schools unanimously resolved not to wear leather shoes or jackets, but to wear blue cloth gowns. But even so, when they first appeared in the countryside, they still aroused the peasants' astonishment. They watched these "misses" and "long-robed gentlemen" wearing rubber shoes, wearing aviator hats, and permed hair, singing all the way. Some peasants said: "In such cold weather, the preachers are still coming to the countryside to preach, singing hymns in their mouths!" They gave speeches, sang songs, and shouted slogans, but the villagers couldn't understand much. Because they couldn't figure out their intentions, some people closed their doors when they came, only looking at them from the cracks in the door.
	The propaganda group encountered difficulties, and some students felt distressed! Could the masses be mobilized after all?
	The Party organization analyzed the situation at the time and felt that although the students had a full of patriotic enthusiasm, they did not understand feudal exploitation, and did not understand that the issue that peasants cared about most was: "Old Master Wang charges too much rent." Therefore, it was necessary to guide the students to first learn from the peasants, to conduct in-depth investigations and interviews among the poor peasants, and to recognize the unity of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, and the relationship between national oppression and class oppression. Under the leadership of the Party, the students conducted investigations and interviews during the day, carried out propaganda activities, and discussed in the propaganda group at night: Why are the peasants poor? Why are the landlords rich?
	When the students walked into that dark and cold small earthen house, they saw an unimaginable scene of painful life. In these harsh years, the students were shivering even wearing fur coats, but some peasant girls only wore a single cloth, and a family of five had only a tattered cotton quilt, eating thin gruel of bran and vegetables. When the students saw this scene, they thought of themselves eating a few days of large pancakes and cabbage soup, and felt that it was too hard to swallow, and even wanted to write a newsletter to the newspaper.
	A peasant told the students: Bran and vegetables can only be eaten until the end of the lunar year, and there will be nothing to eat during the New Year. Every year's harvest is "reversed two or eight," the landlord takes 80%, plus countless exorbitant taxes and levies, how many grains can be left?
	A tenant told the students: He borrowed twenty yuan at high interest to rent three acres of land, and a flood flooded it all. There was no harvest, and the landlord came to collect debts again. The head of the village said: "If you can't pay within seven days, I won't be polite!"
	One family had not eaten for two days, the children were crying, and the children's mother told the students: The children's father went out to work for the landlord, and they would have food to eat when he came back. When will he come back? No one knows...
	The peasants' tearful complaints deeply shocked the students' hearts. Everyone silently walked out of the dilapidated earthen houses, and many thoughts were churning in their minds, fighting fiercely.
	Many students thought: "Did the big white pancakes we eat every day fall from the sky? Did the cotton clothes and fur coats we wear come from a gust of wind? No, these are all the blood and sweat of the working people." "We enjoy everything in palace-like universities, but we don't know how shameful a parasitic life we are living!" "We are talking about resisting Japan every day, talking about mobilizing the masses. If 80% of the country's peasants are oppressed by the mountains of feudal exploitation and live like cattle and horses, how can we win the victory in the anti-Japanese struggle?"
	Through investigation, interviews and discussions, everyone began to realize that only by overthrowing the cannibalistic feudal exploitation system can we mobilize the broad masses of the people and win the victory in the anti-Japanese struggle. The anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutions must be combined. After the students understood the suffering of the peasants, the propaganda became more vivid and effective, and it was carried out more actively, and they were further educated in the process.
	When the third group was conducting propaganda in Matou Town, the students explained with full emotion and in simple terms that the root cause of the hunger and poverty of the peasant brothers was due to the oppression of imperialism and the exploitation of feudal landlords, and the reactionary rule representing imperialism and feudal landlords was the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous government. In particular, when the students talked about how the compatriots in the Northeast lived like cattle and horses after the fall, the peasants could no longer bear it, tears flowed from their eyes, and they angrily shouted "Kill these Japanese devils!" The performance of the street drama "Fight Back to Our Hometown" further aroused the masses' national hatred, and the masses shouted in unison "Down with Japanese imperialism!" An old woman in her fifties walked onto the stage with uncontrollable anger and shouted indignantly: "Everyone must unite to fight Japan, and don't be slaves to the country! Kill one Japanese devil when he comes, and kill ten when he comes!"
	The peasants began to see them as their own. When they gave speeches, they would boil water for them to drink, and some old women would bring out their only pickles for the students to eat. Young peasants enthusiastically invited the students to their homes, pouring out their hatred for the landlords, and secretly told the students about the activities of peasant uprisings nearby.
	All this made the students realize that the power of the national revolution was deeply hidden among the workers and peasants. Many students said: "In the past, the idea that peasants were ignorant, backward, and had low awareness was so wrong." The students said with excitement and shame: "Today we realize that the peasants and the worker-peasant masses are the main force in resisting Japan. The student movement will have no future if it is not combined with the workers and peasants."
	At night, under the dim kerosene lamp, a "life review meeting" was held. Everyone gathered together, debating and pondering the most important truth on the road of life: Should intellectuals be combined with workers and peasants? How should young students move towards revolution?
	One student thought of his family. His father was a capitalist and his uncle was an official in the Kuomintang government. In their lives, they pursued how to make money and how to enjoy themselves. They talked all day about someone being an official and someone taking a concubine; in his uncle's office, even buying a pencil required layers of skimming; "patriotism" was just a facade for them, and they thought that only "fools" would worry about the country. The student said angrily: "I hate this class that gave birth to me and raised me. It is decadent and parasitic, and it cannot save China from danger. Only the workers and peasants are the revolutionary force, and only the workers and peasants are our future and hope." "Even if following the workers and peasants means abandoning a comfortable life and enduring hardship, I would rather do so. This is the only bright road."
	With the gradual in-depth understanding of class struggle in the countryside, everyone increasingly felt that the Communist Party's proposition of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism was correct; the books of Marx and Lenin that had been read secretly in the past were living truths. At the symposium, the leaders of the propaganda group told the students about the Chinese Communist Party's proposition of the anti-Japanese national united front and the heroic deeds of the Red Army marching north to resist Japan. The students began to feel that the Chinese Communist Party truly represented the interests of the broad masses of working people, and only by relying on the people's democratic power and anti-Japanese armed forces under the leadership of the Communist Party can we defeat Japanese imperialism and save the country from danger.
	After the students were educated by the Party and in actual struggle, the thinking of most students progressed rapidly. Some students, because they could not endure hardship, ran back to school halfway. However, when they returned to school, the school was still a boiling life of saving the country, some went to factories to do propaganda, and some were busy supporting the southward logistics work. Moreover, after they returned to school, they were surrounded by enthusiastic students, who asked them to talk about what they had seen and heard along the way, and how to mobilize the peasants to rise up and fight. This was a great impetus for them, making them feel that they had to train themselves to be stronger, and finally returned to the southward propaganda group.
	However, a very small number of students, due to differences in political views, insisted on being anti-Soviet and anti-communist, and left this revolutionary team. On the fourth day after going south, a few students from Yenching University proposed at the conference that they did not agree to sing about the Communist Party and the Soviet Union, and asked the propaganda group to abandon the two most popular programs with the villagers - the drama "Fight Back to Our Hometown" and the "Current Affairs Card Game Song." This proposal was rejected by most students. In order to avoid internal division and unite to resist Japan, the students of Yenching University held a separate meeting of Yenching University students after the conference, and repeatedly educated them and made necessary criticisms, but a few students still did not accept it, and returned to school alone the next morning.
	This was a struggle between two paths. When young intellectuals closely followed the Party and resolutely took the road of resisting Japan and saving the country, they were opposed by a few backward and reactionary students. However, after this struggle, the consciousness of the southward team was further raised, and the will to resist Japan was more resolute. (Attached picture)

    到农村去战斗和学习
    清华大学、北京大学一二·九运动史编写组
    “一二·九”以后，北平学生运动有了极大的发展。但是为了使得已经发展起来的学生运动能够巩固起来和持久下去，并加速向全国推进，扩大影响；为了把学运中的骨干力量保存下来，提高他们的觉悟，能够自觉地有力地进行斗争，党及时地指出：学生的斗争必须和工人、农民、士兵的斗争结合起来，青年学生必须到工农群众中去，和革命的主力军工农结合起来。“到农村去”，党的号召立即变成了群众的革命行动。
    12月下旬，平津学联便立即着手组织“南下扩大宣传团”。“南下扩大宣传团”共分四团。第一团以北京大学为领导，包括东城各大、中学校；第二团以北平大学法商学院为领导，包括西城、南城各大中学校；第三团以清华大学为领导，包括燕京大学及北城朝阳大学、辅仁大学等校；第四团由天津各大中学校组成。各校参加南下宣传的大多是“一二·九”运动中的积极分子，共计五百余人。准备沿平汉路南下，先到固安汇合，然后分头至保定集中。
    1月初，正是北平最冷的日子，寒风怒吼，尘土迷天，南下宣传各团，避开了反动军警预先埋伏下的阻拦，纷纷出发了。
    深夜，第一团在城外农学院集中起来之后，借着微弱的星光奔丰台，绕南苑。次日晌午过黄村，夜宿青云店。一昼夜间走了一百多里路，没有休息，忍冻挨饿。许多同学脚磨破了，仍然咬紧牙关，紧紧跟上队伍。一路上还要警惕地避开军警的追踪。身体十分疲乏；精神十分紧张。由于百十来人一下子涌到青云店，住宿一时难于解决，大家就发挥互助互让的精神，把土炕让给女同学，男同学背靠着背坐在冰冷的土地上打盹。许多女同学，双腿肿得连炕也上不去了。在艰苦的生活里，密切了同学之间的关系。集体的关怀，温暖了他们的心。
    离开学校的头一天，生活整个变了样。在学校里，有温暖的宿舍，吃的是大米白面。而今天，仿佛走入了另一个天地。这样长途的“急行军”、睡冰冷的土房、啃冻硬了的大饼和咸菜，对于每个同学来说都是第一次。这是和工农群众结合的第一关，是个严重的考验。但是，这点痛苦哪能比得上整个民族的痛苦？为了挽救灾难深重的祖国，他们还准备忍受比这更大千万倍的痛苦，甚至不惜贡献出自己的生命。
    夜越深，天气越冷，有的同学睡不着，对着无边的黑夜，低声地哼着救亡歌曲，同学们的思潮像海洋那样地起伏着，他们想着战斗的明天：怎样去宣传呢？农民不识字，宣传会有效吗？
    在南下出发以后，有的学校就一致议决不穿皮鞋，不穿夹克，一律穿蓝布大褂。但即使如此，他们刚在农村出现的时候，仍然引起了农民的惊讶。他们望着这些足登胶鞋、头戴航空帽、烫了头发的“小姐”和“长袍先生们”一路走一路唱歌，有的农民说：“大冷天，吃教的还下乡来宣传，嘴里还唱着赞美诗哩！”他们讲演、唱歌、呼口号，老乡们也听不大懂。由于摸不清他们的来意，有的人见他们来，就把大门关了，只是从门缝里看他们。
    宣传团遭到了困难，有些同学感到苦恼！究竟能不能把群众发动起来呢？
    党的组织分析了当时的情况，感到同学们虽然有满腔抗日热情，但是他们并不懂得封建剥削，不懂得农民最关心的问题是：“王老太爷的租子收得太多了”。因此必须引导同学首先向农民学习，要深入到贫苦农民中去进行调查访问，认识反帝和反封建的一致性，民族压迫和阶级压迫的关系。在党的领导下，同学们白天进行调查访问，展开宣传活动，夜里宣传团内讨论着：农民为什么穷？地主为什么富？
    当同学们一走进那阴暗冰冷的小土房，就看到了一片难以想像的痛苦生活情景。在这严寒的岁月里，同学们穿皮袍还冷得发抖，但有的农家小女孩只穿了一个单布片，一家五口只有一床破棉被，吃的是稀薄的糠菜粥。同学们看见这种情景，想到自己下乡吃了几天大饼白菜汤，就觉得苦得难以下咽，甚至要写通讯登报了。
    一个农民告诉同学：糠菜只能吃到阴历年底，过年便没的吃了，每年的收成，“倒二八分粮”，地主拿走八成，再加上数不清的苛捐杂税，还能剩下几粒粮食呢？
    一个佃户告诉同学：他用高利借来的二十块洋钱佃了三亩地，一场大水全淹掉了，收成没有，东家又来讨债，保长说：“七天交不出，就不客气！”
    有一家人已经两天没吃饭，孩子们哭着，孩子的妈妈告诉同学们：孩子的爸爸出去给地主打短工，要等他回来才有饭吃，什么时候回来？谁也不知道……。
    农民们血泪的倾诉深深地震动着同学们的心。大家默默地走出一家家破旧的土房，许多思想在脑海里翻腾着，激烈地斗争着。
    许多同学想：“我们每天吃的大白饼是从天上掉下来的吗？我们穿的棉衣皮袍是一阵风吹来的吗？不是，这些都是劳动人民的血汗。”“我们在皇宫一样的大学里享受着一切，却不知道我们是过着多么可耻的寄生生活！”“我们每天在谈论着抗日，谈论着发动民众，如果占全国80％的农民都被压在封建剥削的大山之下，过着牛马一般的生活，怎么能取得抗日斗争的胜利呢？”
    通过调查访问和讨论，大家开始认识到，只有推翻吃人的封建剥削制度，才能发动起广大民众，才能取得抗日斗争的胜利，反帝和反封建的革命必须结合起来。同学们懂得了农民的疾苦后，宣传就变得有血有肉，显得更加有效，进行得更活跃了，并且从中进一步受到了教育。
    三团在码头镇宣传的时候，同学们充满感情地通俗地讲解农民兄弟饥饿贫困的根源，是由于帝国主义的压迫和封建地主的剥削，而代表帝国主义和封建地主的反动统治，便是蒋介石卖国政府。特别是，当同学们讲到沦亡后的东北同胞如何过着牛马一般的生活时，农民们再也忍不住了，他们的眼里流出了热泪，愤怒地喊出了“干掉这些日本鬼子！”街头剧“打回老家去”的演出，更激起了群众的民族仇恨，群众齐呼“打倒日本帝国主义！”一位五十多岁的老大娘怒不可遏地走上台去，激愤地喊道：“大家要齐心打日本，不要当亡国奴！日本鬼子来一个毙一个，来十个杀十个！”
    农民开始把他们看作自己人了。他们演讲时，就给他们烧水喝，有的老大娘把自己仅有的一点咸菜，也拿出来给同学们吃。青年农民热情地把同学请到家里，倾诉对地主的仇恨，秘密地告诉同学们附近农民起义的活动。
    这一切使得同学们认识到民族革命的力量是深藏在工农群众中间，许多同学说：“过去以为农民愚昧、落后、觉悟低的想法是多么错误。”同学们又兴奋又惭愧地说：“今天认识到了农民，认识到工农群众才是抗日的主力军，学生运动如果不与工农结合是不会有什么前途的。”
    夜晚，在微弱的煤油灯下，召开着“生活检讨会”，大家围在一起，辩论着、思索着生活道路上最重要的真理：知识分子要不要与工农结合？青年学生应如何走向革命？
    一位同学想起了自己的家庭，爸爸是资本家，叔父是国民党政府的官员，在他们的生活中追求的是如何赚钱，如何享受。整天谈论着某人做了官，某人讨了姨太太；在他叔父的机关里，买一枝铅笔也要层层揩油；“爱国”对他们只是装门面，他们认为只有“傻子”才会为国家去操心，这个同学愤怒地说：“我痛恨这个生我养我的阶级，它是腐朽的寄生的，它不能挽救中国的危亡。只有工农群众才是革命的力量，只有工农群众才是我们的前途和希望。”“尽管跟着工农走，就要抛掉优裕的生活，经受艰苦的考验，但我宁愿如此，这是一条唯一的光明大道。”
    随着对农村阶级斗争的逐步深入了解，大家越来越感到：共产党反帝反封建的主张是正确的；过去秘密阅读过的马克思、列宁的书籍是活生生的真理。在座谈会上，宣传团的领导同志向同学们讲述了中国共产党抗日民族统一战线的主张和红军北上抗日的英勇事迹。同学们开始感到中国共产党确是代表广大劳动人民的利益的，只有依靠共产党领导下的人民民主政权和抗日武装，才能打败日本帝国主义，拯救国家于危亡之境。
    同学们经过党的教育和在实际斗争中的教育，大多数同学的思想迅速地进步着。也有的同学，因为吃不了苦，中途跑回学校去了。但是，回到学校一看，学校却依然是沸腾的救亡生活，有的到工厂去作宣传，有的则忙于支援南下的后勤工作。而且他们回到学校之后，都受到同学们热情的包围，请他们讲沿途见闻，讲如何发动农民起来斗争。这些，对他们是个很大的推动，使他们感到要把自己锻炼得更坚强，终于又回到了南下宣传团。
    但是，有极小部分同学，由于政治主张上的分歧，坚持反苏反共，离开了这一革命队伍。南下以后的第四天，燕京大学就有少数同学在大会上提出不同意歌唱共产党和苏联，要求宣传团放弃两个最受老乡欢迎的节目——话剧《打回老家去》和《时事打牙牌歌》。这个提议被大多数同学所否决。燕京大学同学为了避免内部分裂，团结一致进行抗日，所以在大会后又单独召集燕大同学开会，在会上反复对他们进行了教育和作了必要的批评，但少数同学仍不接受，竟于次日清晨，独自返校了。
    这是一场两条道路的斗争。青年知识分子紧紧跟着党坚决走抗日救亡道路的时候，遭到了少数落后和反动学生的反对。可是，通过这场斗争之后，南下的队伍觉悟更加提高了，抗日的意志更加坚决了。（附图片）
