Xinhua News Agency, Cairo. A spokesman for the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria told Xinhua reporters on the eve of "Get Imperialism Out of Africa Day" on the 29th that 1960 was the year of Africa, and the number of independent African countries had increased to twenty-seven in 1960. He also said that this situation shows that the colonial structure is bound to collapse.

The spokesman also said, "The Chinese revolution is a historically significant contribution to the comprehensive liberation of colonial peoples. Because the Chinese people's revolution has overcome all forms of imperialism and achieved tremendous and rapid achievements, it has set an inspiring example for the people of Asia and Africa."

He said that the current developments in Africa, Asia and Latin America are shifting the balance of power in favor of the socialist camp. He continued, "The nature of imperialism makes them unwilling to give up their plunder automatically, so imperialism will not readily admit defeat. Even if imperialism has been forced to abandon the practice of directly conquering Africa, they are still carrying out conspiracies to maintain colonial rule for a long time through puppet governments under the guise of nominal independence."

The spokesman continued that the Algerian revolution has dealt a blow to the various strategies of imperialists in Africa. Its exposure of imperialist conspiracies has restricted the expansion of neo-colonialists. The Algerian revolution is a constant condemnation of all possible compromises with the imperialists.

The spokesman finally said that the Algerian people will not accept anything that is not genuine and complete independence, and they are confident that they will eventually achieve victory, and they are now about to enter the seventh year of the armed struggle for independence.

    阿尔及利亚临时政府发言人说
    非洲殖民主义结构肯定要垮台
    据新华社开罗讯　阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府发言人29日在“帝国主义滚出非洲日”前夕接见新华社记者时说，1960年是非洲年，非洲独立国家的数目在1960年已经增加到二十七个。他又说，这种情况表明殖民主义结构肯定要垮台。
    这位发言人还说，“中国的革命对殖民地人民的全面解放是一种具有历史意义的贡献。由于中国人民的革命战胜了各种形式的帝国主义，并且取得了巨大的和迅速的成就，这就为亚非各国人民树立了一个令人鼓舞的榜样。”
    他说，非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲目前的事态发展使力量对比有利于社会主义阵营。他继续说，“帝国主义的本性使他们不会自动放弃掠夺品，因此帝国主义不会乖乖地认输。即使帝国主义已经被迫抛弃直接征服非洲的做法，他们仍然在进行阴谋活动，以便在名义上独立的幌子下通过傀儡政府把殖民统治长久保持下去。”
    这位发言人继续说，阿尔及利亚的革命使帝国主义者在非洲的各种策略受到了打击。它对帝国主义者的阴谋的揭露限制了新殖民主义者的扩张。阿尔及利亚革命是对帝国主义者一切可能的妥协的不断的谴责。
    发言人最后说，阿尔及利亚人民将不接受不是真正的和彻底的独立的任何东西，他们确信他们将最后取得胜利，他们现在即将进入争取独立的武装斗争的第七个年头。
