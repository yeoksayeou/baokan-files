Naval swimmer Zhang Mulong and Qiao Yuan, a fourteen-year-old swimmer from Shanghai who was invited to participate in the competition, both broke Zhang Mulong's national record of five minutes, thirty-five and nine-tenths seconds in the men's 400-meter individual medley, and both reached the standard of five minutes and thirty-three seconds for a Master of Sports for the first time in this event. Zhang Mulong created the highest national record - five minutes and twenty-nine seconds. Qiao Yuan's score was five minutes and thirty seconds and nine-tenths, which was an improvement over his own score (five minutes and thirty-three seconds and four-tenths) when he first broke this national record three days ago (November 27).
