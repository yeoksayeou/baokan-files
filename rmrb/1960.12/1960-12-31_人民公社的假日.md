    People's Commune Holiday
    December 13th was a holiday for the Nanlong People's Commune in Nanbu County, Sichuan. In this place of mountain upon mountain, bay upon bay, with green bamboo lining the roads everywhere, the village roads and courtyards were filled with laughter. People put on their neatest clothes, carrying chickens and baskets, some going to the market, others visiting relatives and friends, greeting each other warmly along the way.
    Since the commune began implementing a half-month holiday, the members have become more actively concerned about production. The day before the holiday, in order to ensure that the rapeseed received its first fertilizer application on time, a moving scene of active labor appeared throughout the commune. Finally, more than 800 mu of rapeseed were watered in one day.
    Now, by the clear streams, groups of three or five female commune members are washing clothes. Under the eaves of each courtyard, there are also people sitting and doing needlework. Winter has arrived, and the children need more clothes, and the adults need to make shoes… Male commune members and young people who didn't go out went to participate in activities organized by the Communist Youth League, while others did some small handicrafts or went to their vegetable gardens to weed. Everyone had a very happy holiday.
    You Qihua, a member of the Fifth Management District, discussed with his whole family the night before: take advantage of the holiday to finish what needs to be done, have a good rest, and concentrate on production when going to work. After eating breakfast, he went to the market. His eldest son's mother-in-law had recently fallen ill, so the eldest son took the holiday to visit her. The youngest son sat in the yard weaving "bamboo baskets" with bamboo strips, preparing to find time to catch fish. His wife and daughter-in-law washed clothes and made shoe soles.
    Across a small mountain, along the main road, are the commune's high-yield fields. Nestled in the dark, lush, and thriving wheat fields are the houses of the commune members of the First Management District. Commune member Jiang Shusheng got up early and climbed onto the roof to repair it with the rice straw distributed by the commune. Recently, the commune distributed straw for the winter to each member. Six households in his team were repairing their houses that day.
    In order to ensure that the commune members had a good holiday, each canteen specially prepared rich meals for the members. The cooks also skillfully prepared fresh and delicious food for everyone.
    During the pleasant holiday, people did not forget: to create a better life through labor. Wu Shixiu, the female commune member in charge of rapeseed, returned to her parents' home and saw that the rapeseed there was strong and healthy. She immediately "took lessons" from the commune members there. As soon as she returned home, she looked for the captain to discuss new measures for managing the rapeseed well. Ma Shaoli, the work team leader of the Second Team of the Fifth Management District, specially ran to the Jinxing Commune, which had always been a competitor, to see friends. When he found that the wheat there was managed better than his own, he called a brief meeting of the work team that evening. The team members were all eager to try, determined to start catching up the next day, vowing not to give up until they caught up and surpassed them; they were determined to win new and greater victories.

    人民公社的假日
    12月13日，四川南部县南隆人民公社的休假日来到了。在这个山连山、湾连湾，处处翠竹夹道的地方，村道上、院坝中充满了欢笑声。人们换上了整洁的衣裳，抱着鸡，提着筐，有的去赶场，有的去走亲访友，在路上亲热地打着招呼。
    公社坚持半月放假一天以来，社员对生产更加积极关心。放假的前一天，社员为了使油菜按期追第一次肥，这一天全社到处都出现了积极劳动的动人景象。终于在一天内就把八百多亩油菜浇完。
    如今，在清亮的小溪边，三五成群的女社员们在洗衣服。每个院子的屋檐下还有坐着做针线活的人。冬天来了，孩子们要添些衣服，大人也要做双鞋……。没有出门的男社员和青年去参加共青团组织的活动去了，其余有的做点小手工，有的到自己的菜园地去除草。在休假日里，人人都过得很愉快。
    五管区的社员犹启华头一天晚上全家就商量好了：趁放假把要办的事办完，好好休息一天，出工时好一心一意搞生产。他吃完早饭后，就到街上赶场。他大儿子的岳母最近生了病，大儿子就乘假日去探望。小儿子坐在院里用竹条编“竹兜”，准备抽空去捞鱼。妻子和媳妇洗衣服、做鞋底。
    翻过一座小山，顺着大路一带都是公社的高产田。座落在黑郁郁、绿油油茁壮的麦田中的是一管区社员的房子。社员蒋树生从早上起来就爬上房子，用社里发给的稻草修补房顶。最近，社里给每个社员都发了过冬的铺草。他所在的一队有六户社员都在这天修补房子。
    为了让社员过好假日，各个食堂都特地为社员们准备了丰盛的饭菜。炊事员们还心灵手巧地为大家做出新鲜可口的饮食。
    在愉快的假日里，人们并未忘记：用劳动去创造更美好的生活。管油菜的女社员吴士秀回娘家，看到那里的油菜又壮又好，当场就向那里的社员“拜师取经”。一回家就找队长研究管好油菜的新措施。五管区二队作业组长马绍礼特地跑到一直做为竞赛对象的金星公社去看朋友。当他发现那里的小麦管得比自己好，晚上回来后，就召集这个作业组开了个简短的小会。组员们个个磨拳擦掌，决心第二天就动手追，提出不赶上、不超过绝不罢休；他们决心夺取新的更大的胜利。
