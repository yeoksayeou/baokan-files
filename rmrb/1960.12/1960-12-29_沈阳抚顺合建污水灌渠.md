The completion will enable the use of Fushun's sewage to irrigate large areas of farmland on both sides of the Hun River between Shenyang and Fushun, promoting increased rice production and saving a large amount of ammonium sulfate and fertilization labor.

(Our newspaper dispatch) According to the Liaoning Daily: Shenyang and Fushun have recently begun jointly constructing a sewage irrigation canal. This is an important measure for Shenyang and Fushun to implement the policy of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production. After the completion of this irrigation canal, the sewage from Fushun can be diverted to irrigate and fertilize more than one million mu of paddy fields on both sides of the Hun River between Fushun and Sujiatun, Shenyang.

Urban sewage is an inexhaustible source of fertilizer. Currently, Fushun can discharge 340,000 to 400,000 tons of sewage every day. The sewage contains large amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and other elements, which can promote crop growth and grain filling. The Liaoning Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to the experience of using sewage for irrigation. This autumn, Comrade Huang Huqing, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, inspected the Lishizhai People's Commune in the suburbs of Fushun, where sewage irrigation was being tested, and then instructed the Shenyang and Fushun Municipal Party Committees to vigorously promote the experience of sewage irrigation. The Shenyang and Fushun Municipal Party Committees held special meetings to study the matter and decided to jointly construct the Shen-Fu sewage irrigation area and jointly formulate a construction plan. The entire irrigation area project is divided into two parts: one part is the urban section, which is a concrete underground canal; the other part is an open earthen canal. The total length is 69.2 kilometers. In order to benefit as soon as possible, Fushun has also decided to first build a part of the underground canal into an open canal, intercept the sewage and send it to the Shen-Fu irrigation canal.

In order to complete the construction task on schedule, the Fushun Municipal Party Committee established a special leading group and a construction headquarters, and transferred many capable cadres to go deep into the construction site, set up camp, participate in the construction and lead the construction. Shenyang and the various districts of Shenyang have also established construction headquarters and command posts respectively. The cadres and workers participating in the construction are all in high spirits and full of energy, racing against time and doing everything possible to speed up the progress of the project.

After the completion of this project, it will bring great benefits to the people's communes benefiting from both sides of the Hun River. At the same time, it can avoid sewage pollution of the Hun River, beautify the environment, benefit sanitation, and develop the fish farming industry.

    沈阳抚顺合建污水灌渠
    完工后可以利用抚顺的污水灌溉沈阳抚顺间浑河两岸大
    面积农田，促进水稻增产，并节省大量硫铵和施肥劳力
    本报讯　据辽宁日报消息：沈阳、抚顺两市最近开始联合修建一条污水灌渠。这是沈阳、抚顺贯彻执行大办农业、大办粮食方针的一项重要措施，这条灌渠建成以后，可以将抚顺市的污水引到抚顺至沈阳苏家屯间浑河两岸的百余万亩稻田内，灌溉肥田。
    城市污水是一项取之不尽，用之不竭的肥源。目前抚顺市每天就可排出污水三十四万到四十万吨。污水内含有大量的氮、磷、钾等成分，能够促进农作物生长和籽粒饱满。中共辽宁省委对用污水灌田的经验极为重视。今年秋季，省委第一书记黄火青同志曾到试验用污水灌田的抚顺市郊李石寨公社视察过，随后又指示沈阳、抚顺市委，大力推广污水灌田经验。沈阳和抚顺市委专门召开会议研究，决定联合修建沈抚污水灌区，并共同制订了工程计划。整个灌区工程分为两部分，一部分是城市段，为混凝土暗渠；另一部分是土明沟渠。全长六十九点二公里。为了早日受益，抚顺市还决定将一部分暗渠先建成明沟渠，将污水截流送入沈抚灌渠中。
    为了按期完成工程建设任务，中共抚顺市委成立了专门领导小组、同时成立了工程指挥部，抽调许多得力干部深入工地，安营扎寨，参加施工领导施工。沈阳市及沈阳各区也分别成立了工程指挥部和指挥所。参加施工的干部和工人都意气风发，干劲十足，争分夺秒，千方百计地加快工程进度。
    这项工程完成后，将给浑河两岸各受益人民公社带来巨大效益。同时，可以避免污水对浑河的污染，既美化环境，利于卫生，又可以发展养鱼事业。
