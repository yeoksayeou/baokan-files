    (Our newspaper reports) The leading Party and government military organs and the broad masses of people in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Fujian, Jiangxi, Anhui and Shanghai are enthusiastically supporting the people in the severely stricken areas of Shandong Province to overcome the famine.
    In order to support the people in the disaster areas of Shandong Province, the provincial Party committees of each province held meetings to specifically study the issue of supporting production and disaster relief in the disaster areas of Shandong Province. At the same time, they called on the vast numbers of cadres and masses to deeply develop the movement to increase production and practice economy in the spirit of communism of "one area in trouble, all areas support," and increase the production of more grain and vegetables to support the disaster areas of Shandong Province. Jiangxi and Fujian provinces have established special organizations headed by responsible cadres to support production and disaster relief in the disaster areas of Shandong Province. The leading Party, government, and military organs of Jiangsu Province and Shanghai have also successively held meetings, formulated plans, studied measures, and vigorously provided support. According to incomplete statistics, in addition to saving food and vigorously supporting the disaster areas, the above five provinces and one city have also transferred large quantities of canned food, medicine, shoes, socks, cotton, and cotton cloth and other materials.
    The vast numbers of cadres and people in the provinces and cities have demonstrated a noble communist spirit in their activities to support the people in the disaster areas of Shandong. Comrade Yao Qin of the Anhui Provincial Federation of Trade Unions heard the call of the Provincial Party Committee and immediately found eleven pieces of clothing, all of which were dismantled and washed clean to support the people in the disaster areas. Under the slogan "The difficulties of the people in the disaster areas of Shandong are our own difficulties," all organs in Shanghai supported the disaster areas of Shandong with 400,000 jin of grain and various materials worth 380,000 yuan saved by the organs. The officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front also saved hundreds of thousands of jin of grain to support the disaster areas of Shandong. The people in southern and northern Fujian, where the four seasons are like spring, are currently stepping up the expansion of wheat and winter vegetable planting to support the people in the disaster areas.
    The care and support of the fraternal provinces and cities have greatly increased the confidence of the people in the disaster areas of Shandong in overcoming disasters, overcoming difficulties, working hard, and continuing to leap forward.
    (Our newspaper reports) The Party, government, army and people of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Fujian, Jiangxi, Anhui and Shanghai recently organized comfort delegations to conduct comfort activities in the disaster-stricken areas of Shandong.
    During the consolation period, all the comrades of the consolation delegation went deep into the communes and production teams in spite of the severe cold and snow to offer their condolences. In addition to holding consolation meetings in each place to express the deep friendship of the leading Party, government and military organs and the broad masses of people in the five provinces and one city of East China, they also listened to the reports of the cadres of the communes and production teams to help the communes and production teams sum up their experiences in production and disaster relief. The activities of the comfort delegation gave great encouragement to the people in the disaster areas. The people in the disaster areas said excitedly: "Chairman Mao has sent people!" and they all expressed that they must work hard, engage in production and disaster relief, and strive for a bumper harvest next year.

    本报讯　浙江、江苏、福建、江西、安徽等省和上海市党政军领导机关和广大人民，热情支援山东省遭受严重灾荒地区人民渡荒。
    各省省委为支援山东遭灾地区人民度荒，都召开了会议，专门研究了支援山东省灾区生产救灾的问题，同时号召广大干部和群众本着“一方有灾，各方支援”的共产主义精神，深入开展增产节约运动，增产更多的粮食和蔬菜支援山东灾区。江西、福建等省都以负责干部为首成立了支援山东省灾区生产救灾的专门机构。江苏省和上海市党政军领导机关，也都先后召开会议，制订方案，研究措施，大力给予支援。据不完全统计，上述五省一市除节约粮食大力支援灾区外，还调运大批罐头食品、药品以及鞋袜、棉花、棉布等大批物资。
    各省、市广大干部和人民，在支援山东灾区人民的活动中，表现了崇高的共产主义精神。安徽省总工会姚芹同志听到省委号召，立即找出十一件衣服，并全部拆洗干净，支援灾区人民。上海市各机关在“山东灾区人民的困难，就是我们自己的困难”的口号下，将机关节约下来的四十万斤粮食、价值三十八万元的各种物资支援山东灾区。福建前线解放军官兵还将自己节约出来的数十万斤粮食，支援了山东灾区。四季如春的福建省闽南、闽北地区人民为了支援灾区人民，目前正加紧扩种小麦、冬菜。
    兄弟省、市人民的关怀和支援，大大提高了山东灾区人民战胜灾荒、克服困难、埋头苦干、继续跃进的信心。
    本报讯　浙江、江苏、福建、江西、安徽五省和上海市党政军民，最近曾组织慰问团，深入山东受灾地区进行慰问活动。
    慰问团全体同志在慰问期间，冒着严寒风雪，深入公社、生产队进行慰问。他们每到一地除召开慰问会，表达华东五省一市党政军领导机关和广大人民的深情厚谊外，还听取了公社、生产队干部的汇报，帮助公社和生产队总结生产救灾的经验。慰问团的活动，给灾区人民很大的鼓舞。灾区人民激动得说：“毛主席派人来了！”并纷纷表示一定要发愤图强、生产救灾，争取明年丰收。
