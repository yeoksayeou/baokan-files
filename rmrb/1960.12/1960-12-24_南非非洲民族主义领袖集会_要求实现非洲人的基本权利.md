Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, December 20th: South African African nationalist leaders, disregarding the persecution and threats of the South African Federal authorities, held a meeting from the 16th to the 18th in Orlando, an African township near Johannesburg, to formulate a unified view of Africans on the South African political situation.

Thirty-six African representatives from all over South Africa attended the meeting. The meeting expressed opposition to South African Federal Prime Minister Verwoerd's plan to establish a fascist "republic" in South Africa.

The meeting agreed to convene a national conference attended by people of all races to study the realization of the basic rights of all ethnic groups and to seek ways to promote the unity of the African people.

The South African Federal authorities adopted repressive measures against this meeting. On the 17th, police briefly detained ten representatives and ordered the expulsion of two representatives from Cape Town from the township. The police also took away the meeting's documents, including a draft resolution submitted to the meeting, which pointed out that the serious situation in South Africa was due to the authorities' refusal to grant basic rights to Africans.

Reports say that this meeting was convened by Luthuli, former Rector of Blackerburg (non-white) University Matthews, and several other prominent Africans. Luthuli and Matthews were arrested during the large-scale struggle of Africans against the "pass laws" in South Africa in March and April this year. Meanwhile, according to reports from Durban, the people in the Pondoland African "reserve" on the south coast of South Africa continue to struggle, resisting colonial goods, refusing to pay taxes to the authorities, and opposing the South African authorities' implementation of the segregationist "Bantu administrative system."

It is reported that in Cape Town, Durban, East London, and Johannesburg, incidents have recently occurred in which Africans opposed racial segregation in restaurants or theaters.

    南非非洲民族主义领袖集会
    要求实现非洲人的基本权利
    据新华社20日讯　约翰内斯堡消息：南非非洲民族主义领袖，不顾南非联邦当局的迫害和威胁，从16日到18日在约翰内斯堡附近的非洲人市镇奥兰多举行会议，以拟定非洲人对南非政局的统一看法。
    参加会议的有来自南非各地的三十六名非洲人代表。会议表示反对南非联邦总理维沃尔德要在南非建立法西斯式的“共和国”。
    会议同意召开一个有各种族人民参加的全国大会来研究实现各族人民的基本权利，并且寻求促进非洲人民团结的途径。
    南非联邦当局对这次会议采取镇压措施。警察在17日曾一度拘捕了十名代表并下令把来自开普敦的两位代表逐出这个城镇。警察还拿走了会议的文件，其中包括一项提交会议的决议草案，草案中指出，南非的严重情况是由于当局拒绝给非洲人的基本权利。
    消息说，这次会议是由卢图利和前黑厄堡（非白人）大学校长马修斯等若干著名非洲人士召开的。在今年3、4月间南非当局镇压非洲人反对“通行证法”的大规模斗争时，卢图利和马修斯都曾被逮捕过。同时，据来自德班的消息说，南非南海岸庞多兰非洲人“保留地”人民继续在进行斗争，他们抵制殖民者的货物，拒绝向当局纳税，反对南非当局推行种族隔离的“班图行政制度”。
    据报道，在开普敦、德班、东伦敦城和约翰内斯堡等地，最近也都发生了非洲人反对在餐室或戏院实行种族隔离的事件。
