    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, December 14th: Washington Dispatch: U.S. President-elect Kennedy announced on the 13th the appointment of Ford Motor Company General Manager Robert McNamara as the Secretary of Defense in the next government.
    Kennedy's new appointment indicates that another "Cabinet of Millionaires" is taking shape in the United States. The day before, Kennedy had already appointed Rockefeller Foundation President Rusk as the next Secretary of State.
    During the Republican administration, the position of Secretary of State had also been consistently occupied by inner-circle figures of the Rockefeller Consortium such as Dulles and Herter. The position of Secretary of Defense was successively held by representatives of Wall Street financial groups such as Wilson (former General Manager of General Motors), McElroy, and Gates. The Department of Defense is directly responsible for expanding armaments and preparing for war, and issuing military orders, while companies like Ford Motor Company and General Motors Corporation happen to be contractors for large government military orders.
    In announcing the appointment of McNamara, Kennedy stated that he would step up the implementation of the policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war. He clamored that the military strength of the United States "must be strong" and his government is "determined to make America's defense second to none."
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, December 17th: Washington Dispatch: U.S. Democratic President-elect Kennedy announced on the 16th the appointment of Douglas Dillon as the next Secretary of the Treasury of the U.S. government. Dillon is currently the Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs in the Republican government.
    Dillon is both a finance and oil capitalist and a politician in the American bureaucracy. He previously served as Chairman of Dillon, Read & Co., Director of the United States and Foreign Securities Corporation and its subsidiary American and International Securities Corporation, and Director of Amerada Petroleum Corporation. Amerada Petroleum Corporation has huge oil fields in Africa, and it colludes with the Morgan Consortium's Continental Oil Company and the Rockefeller Consortium's Ohio Oil Company, extracting huge profits from Africa every year. In the past, Dillon has been in the U.S. State Department representing the interests of these most enthusiastic about expansion and aggression oil and financial monopoly capitalist groups. Before becoming Deputy Secretary of State, he served as the U.S. Ambassador to France.
    On the same day, Kennedy also appointed his brother Robert Kennedy as the next Attorney General of the U.S. government. Kennedy has also appointed the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Labor.
    So far, the main team of Kennedy's cabinet has been pieced together.

    肯尼迪凑成富豪内阁班底
    福特汽车公司总经理麦克纳马拉任国防部长金融、石油资本家狄龙被任命为财政部长
    新华社14日讯　华盛顿消息：美国当选总统肯尼迪13日宣布任命福特汽车公司总经理罗伯特·麦克纳马拉为下届政府的国防部长。
    肯尼迪的新任命表明，美国又一个“富豪内阁”正在形成。在前一天，肯尼迪已经任命洛克菲勒基金会主席腊斯克为下届国务卿。
    在共和党政府执政期间，国务卿的职位也一直是由杜勒斯和赫脱等洛克菲勒财团的围内人物占据。国防部长的职位则先后由威尔逊
  （曾任通用汽车公司总经理）、麦克耳罗伊和盖茨等华尔街财阀的代表把持。国防部是直接负责扩军备战、发放军事定货的，而像福特汽车公司、通用汽车公司等恰恰就是政府大量军事定货的承包商。
    肯尼迪在宣布任命麦克纳马拉时表示，他将加紧推行扩军备战的政策。他叫嚷说，美国的军事力量“必须是强大”的，他的政府“决心使美国的防务不次于任何人”。
    新华社17日讯　华盛顿消息：美国民主党当选总统肯尼迪16日宣布任命道格拉斯·狄龙为下届美国政府的财政部长。狄龙是目前共和党政府中负责经济事务的副国务卿。
    狄龙既是一个金融、石油资本家，又是美国官场的一个政客。他曾任狄龙—里德公司董事长，美国对外证券公司及其子公司美国与国际证券公司董事，和阿美拉达石油公司的董事。阿美拉达石油公司在非洲拥有巨大的油田，它和摩根财团的大陆石油公司与洛克菲勒财团的俄亥俄石油公司勾结，每年从非洲榨取巨额的利润。而狄龙过去就一直在美国国务院代表美国这些最热中于扩张和侵略的石油和金融垄断资本集团的利益。他在出任副国务卿前，曾当过美国驻法大使。
    肯尼迪在同一天还任命他的弟弟罗伯特·肯尼迪为下届美国政府的司法部长。肯尼迪还已经任命了农业部长和劳工部长。
    至此肯尼迪内阁的主要班底已拼凑完成。
