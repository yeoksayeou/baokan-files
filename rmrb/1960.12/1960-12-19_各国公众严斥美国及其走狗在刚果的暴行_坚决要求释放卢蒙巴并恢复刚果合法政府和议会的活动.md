Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Public and organizations in various countries continue to condemn the crime of the colonialists headed by U.S. imperialism and their stooge Mobutu gang in illegally arresting and brutally mistreating Congo's legitimate government Prime Minister Lumumba. They resolutely demand the immediate release of Congo's leaders headed by Lumumba, and express their support for the Congolese people's patriotic struggle.

The Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, Grishin, in a telegram to the President of the United Nations Security Council and the President of the 15th Session of the General Assembly, stated that the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions demands an immediate end to the atrocities of the colonialists and their servants in the Congo, and demands the release of Lumumba and all arrested Congolese patriots.

The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions also issued a statement on the situation in the Congo, pointing out that the current tragedy of the Congolese people was caused under the cover of the "UN forces" headquarters and the UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld.

Enterprise employees, agricultural production cooperative members, and office cadres in the German Democratic Republic have been writing letters and sending telegrams to the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany, unanimously demanding an end to the bloody terror in the Congo and the release of Prime Minister Lumumba and other leaders of the Congo's legitimate government.

The Czechoslovak Committee for the Defense of Peace has received a large number of letters and telegrams from working people across the country, resolutely demanding the release of Congo's legitimate government leader Lumumba, demanding the disarmament of the Mobutu gang, and demanding an end to the imperialist atrocities against the Congolese people.

More than three thousand vehicle repair workers in Bydgoszcz, Poland, held a mass meeting on the 15th, protesting against the colonialists' armed intervention in the Congo and protesting against the crime of illegally arresting Prime Minister Lumumba and other leaders of the Congo's legitimate government.

The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization issued an appeal in Cairo on the 14th to the National Committees of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization, requesting them to support the Congolese people's struggle against imperialism headed by the United States. The appeal called on the people of Asian and African countries to organize widespread mass movements in their own countries, demanding the release of Lumumba, Okito, Kasongo and other Congolese patriots, and supporting the just demands of the Congo's legitimate government against colonialism.

The Secretariat of the National Council of the Communist Party of India issued a statement to the press on the Congo situation. The statement said that the lives of Prime Minister Lumumba and his colleagues are clearly threatened by the Mobutu armed bandits instigated by U.S., Belgian, French, and British imperialists. The statement said that the lives of Lumumba and his colleagues must be protected; the Mobutu army must be disarmed and disbanded; and the power of Prime Minister Lumumba's regime and the authority of his government and parliament must be restored.

The Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia, Aidit, issued a statement calling on the Indonesian people to support the just struggle of the Congolese people, and protested to the United Nations and the U.S. and Belgian embassies in Indonesia for the colonial crimes they committed in the Congo. The statement condemned the United States for using the "United Nations forces" to achieve its own colonial interests.

About one hundred Indian parliamentarians issued an appeal to parliaments around the world, urging them to ensure Lumumba's immediate release. They also called for the restoration of the activities of the country's legitimate parliament.

The Secretary-General of the Iraqi National Committee of Peace Partisans, Aziz Sharif, sent a telegram to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld protesting the arrest and torture of Prime Minister Lumumba. The telegram said: The series of regrettable and shameful events that occurred in the Congo are the result of the conspiracies and "UN forces" intervention of imperialist countries headed by U.S. imperialism.

President Keita of the Republic of Mali said in a reply telegram to UAR President Nasser regarding the Congo situation, "If the United Nations does not guarantee the immediate release of Lumumba and restore the power of the Congo's legitimate government, this will aggravate the threat to peace and security."
