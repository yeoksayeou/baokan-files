Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 26th -- According to a broadcast on the "Voice of Laos" radio station on the 25th, the representative of the Royal Lao Government, Minister of Propaganda, Quinim Pholsena, issued a statement, once again declaring that Prince Phouma's government is the only legitimate government in Laos.

    The statement said, "Although the Royal Government and administrative organs have temporarily withdrawn from Vientiane, the Lao people of all ethnicities are determined to live freely and fight to the end for justice under the leadership of the legitimate government, and no force can shake this determination."

    The statement said, "I think it is necessary to emphasize that the Vong-Phoumi 'interim government' is completely illegal. Correctly speaking, it is a 'government' established by a rebel group of loyal lackeys of foreign countries."

    The statement pointed out that after the riots in Luang Prabang, the Lao Royal Government issued a statement at a meeting held in Vientiane on November 11, stating that from November 11, the legitimate government will not implement any decisions that the King may make under duress. As for the parliament, after the riots in Vientiane, most of the parliamentarians were abducted to Savannakhet. Therefore, the resolutions of the parliament cannot be regarded as valid.

    The statement, after condemning the rebels for introducing wolves into the house under the wing of foreign aggressors, killing compatriots, creating an expanded civil war, and further relying on U.S. imperialism, emphasized: "The Lao people only recognize one government, that is, the government that has announced a policy of peace, neutrality, and national harmony." "I reiterate that our consistent will is to continue to pursue the policies pointed out by the Souvanna Phouma government."

    The statement said, "I call on all Lao people to unite around the government in order to fight for the realization of the government's proposed policy line of peace, neutrality, and national harmony and against foreign interference."

    The statement expressed gratitude to all peace-loving and just countries that have supported and helped Laos. The statement also called on and hoped that the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference and the participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference would take urgent measures, first of all, to reconvene the Geneva Conference in order to resolve the Lao issue.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 25th -- The Pathet Lao Fighting Units Radio on the 24th commented on the recent admission by U.S. State Department officials that the U.S. has been continuously providing weapons and military supplies to the Phoumi Nosavan-Vong Nachampassak traitorous clique. It pointed out that the admission by U.S. State Department officials once again proves that U.S. imperialism is deliberately invading Laos, ignoring the condemnation of it by peace-loving countries in Southeast Asia and the world.

    The commentary said that U.S. imperialism's import of weapons and military supplies into Laos has devastated Laos and plunged the Lao people into the abyss of fratricidal warfare. This crime of U.S. imperialism has trampled on the sovereignty of Laos, seriously threatened the peace of Southeast Asia, and is also a provocation against peace-loving countries and a violation of international law.

    奔舍那重申富马政府是唯一合法政府
    老挝人民决心为和平中立而斗争
    不能执行国王和议会在叛乱集团胁迫下作出的任何决定
    新华社河内26日电　据“老挝之声”电台25日广播，老挝王国政府代表、宣传大臣贵宁·奔舍那发表声明，再次宣布富马亲王政府是老挝唯一的合法政府。
    声明说，“王国政府和行政机关虽然暂时撤出了万象，但是老挝各民族坚决要求过自由的生活、为了正义而在合法政府的领导下战斗到底，任何力量都不能使这种决心动摇。”
    声明说，“我认为有必要强调，文翁—富米的‘临时政府’，是完全非法的，正确地说，它是一个由外国的忠实走狗的叛乱集团所建立起来的‘政府’。”
    声明指出，在琅勃拉邦发生暴乱后，老挝王国政府11月11日在万象举行的会议曾发表声明说，从11月11日起，合法政府将不执行国王可能在武力压力下所作出的任何决定。在国会方面，万象发生暴乱后，大部议员被挟持到沙湾拿吉，因此，国会的决议也不能视为是有效的。
    声明在谴责叛乱分子在外国侵略者的卵翼下引狼入室、杀害同胞、制造扩大内战和进一步投靠美帝国主义的罪行后强调说：“老挝人民只承认一个政府，即曾经宣布和平中立和民族和睦政策的政府。”“我再次表明我们始终如一的意志是，继续奉行梭发那·富马政府所指出的政策。”
    声明说：“我呼吁全体老挝人民团结在政府周围，以便为实现政府提出的和平中立和民族和睦的政策路线和反对外国的干涉而斗争。”
    声明对曾经支持和帮助老挝的爱好和平和公理的各国表示感谢。声明还呼吁和希望日内瓦会议两位主席和1954年日内瓦会议参加国采取紧急措施，首先是重新召开日内瓦会议，以便解决老挝问题。
    据新华社河内25日电　寮国战斗部队电台24日就美国国务院官员最近承认美国不断向富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞叛国集团提供武器和军用品一事发表评论。它指出，美国国务院官员的承认，再一次证明了美帝国主义是蓄意侵略老挝，无视东南亚和世界上爱好和平国家的公正舆论对它的谴责。
    评论说，美帝国主义向老挝输入武器和军用品，使得老挝遭受摧残，使得老挝人民陷于自相残杀的水深火热中。美帝国主义的这种罪行，蹂躏了老挝的主权，严重威胁了东南亚的和平，同时是对爱好和平国家的挑衅，是违反国际法的行为。
