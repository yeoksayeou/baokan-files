    A Role Model for Picking Up Heavy Burdens
    Su Yifeng
    Zhai Sumei and six other girls from Jizhuang Brigade, Ge Village Farm, Zhenjiang City, Jiangsu Province, worked hard, strived to become stronger, and did everything possible to transform low-yield fields into high-yield fields with their diligent hands. However, after transforming them into high-yield fields, they gave them to others to cultivate, while they themselves went on to transform other low-yield fields.
    Where does this noble style and great spirit of "leaving difficulties to oneself and making things easy for others" come from? They said: "To change the poor and blank state, we young people have a surge of energy to specifically seek out difficulties and specifically let others do the easy things." Great ideals generate great power. "Surge of energy" does not come from the sky, but from great ideals.
    "Poverty" and "blankness" are inherently closely related. Changing the backward economic situation—poverty—is conducive to us more quickly changing the backward state of science, culture, and technology—blankness. Zhai Sumei and the others deeply understand this. With this strong sense of responsibility for the socialist cause, with this broad mind of taking the world as one's own responsibility, what difficulties can stand in the way? What personal gains or losses matter? Our struggle and labor are to constantly turn the lofty ideals of communism into reality. It is this lofty ideal that inspires us to keep moving forward.
    Chairman Mao taught us: "Burdens are light and heavy. Some people pick the light ones and fear the heavy ones, pushing the heavy burdens to others and picking the light ones for themselves. This is not a good attitude. Some comrades are not like this; they give enjoyment to others, pick the heavy burdens for themselves, endure hardship before others, and enjoy after others. Such comrades are good comrades." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume 4, p. 1160)
    We should learn from Zhai Sumei and the others. Learn from their spirit of striving to become stronger and working hard to change the poor and blank state of the motherland, and learn from their communist style of "leaving difficulties to oneself and making things easy for others," and picking up heavy burdens to carry, to be a great and glorious proletarian fighter.

    拣重担子挑的榜样
    苏以风
    江苏省镇江市葛村农场纪庄大队，翟素梅等七个姑娘，艰苦奋斗，发愤图强，用勤劳的双手把低产田千方百计地改造成高产田，可是改造成高产田后，她们却把它让给别人去耕种，自己却又去改造低产田了。
    这种“把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人”的高尚风格和伟大精神来自何处？她们说：“要改变又穷又白的面貌，我们年轻人就有一股子冲劲，专门找困难打，专门把容易做的事让给别人。”伟大的理想，产生伟大的力量。“冲劲”不是从天而降的，而是来自伟大的理想。
    “穷”和“白”本来是密切相关的，改变了经济上的落后状况——穷，就有利于我们更迅速地来改变科学、文化、技术上的落后状态——白。这是翟素梅她们深为理解的。有了这种对社会主义事业的强烈责任感，有了这种以天下为己任的广阔胸怀，那还有什么困难能阻挡得住？那还有什么个人的得失？我们的斗争和劳动，就是为了不断地把共产主义的崇高理想变成现实。正是这个崇高的理想在鼓舞着我们不断前进。
    毛主席教导我们说：“担子有轻有重。有的人拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己拣轻的挑。这就不是好的态度。有的同志不是这样，享受让给人家，担子拣重的挑，吃苦在别人前头，享受在别人后头。这样的同志就是好同志。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷1160页）
    我们应该向翟素梅她们学习。学习她们为改变祖国穷白面貌而发愤图强、艰苦奋斗的精神，学习她们“把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人”、拣重担子挑的共产主义风格，做一个伟大的光荣的无产阶级战士。
