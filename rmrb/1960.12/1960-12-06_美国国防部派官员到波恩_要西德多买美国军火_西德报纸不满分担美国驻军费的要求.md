Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, December 3rd: After the United States' request for West Germany to help alleviate its international payment crisis failed, the US government is now seeking to strengthen West Germany's rearmament, wanting West Germany to purchase more American weapons. It intends to extract money from West Germany in this way.

On December 2nd, sources from Bonn's diplomatic circles revealed that two senior officials from the US Department of Defense, including the Director of the Military Assistance Program, Mr. Kass, recently held secret talks with the West German government in Bonn, demanding that West Germany significantly increase its share of military spending within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and purchase more weapons and military supplies from the United States.

According to the Bonn-based *Parliament and Political News Gazette*, in addition to missiles and radar equipment that West Germany has already purchased, the United States is also asking West Germany to buy American guns, various types of motorcycles, and so on.

Bonn newspapers revealed that the United States not only wants West Germany to buy more US weapons but also to bear the cost of equipping the armies of countries within NATO, such as Greece and Turkey. Moreover, the United States is demanding that West Germany pay a large amount of cash in advance when purchasing American weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, December 3rd: West German bourgeois newspapers continue to express strong dissatisfaction with the United States' attempt to have West Germany pay to help the US resolve its international payment crisis.

The West German monopoly capitalist newspaper *German Newspaper and Economic Newspaper* complained bitterly in an editorial on December 3rd about the US demand that West Germany increase its share of the burden of expenses for the NATO aggressive bloc, as well as its demand that West Germany increase development aid and increase funding for maintaining US troops, etc. The editorial said that this was treating West Germany "as having the same patience as a real donkey."

The editorial refuted *New York Times* reporter Sulzberger's view that West Germany was "rich in oil and water," emphasizing that "in any case, (West) Germany is poorer than the US, Britain, and France."

The newspaper wanted West Germany's "allies" not to forget that West Germany has a smaller population than the United States. "If it (West Germany) participates in 18% of NATO's expenditures, this means the same thing as the United States accepting 70%."

It also emphasized that having West Germany pay for the US military occupation "today would not only be detrimental to (West Germany) domestically but also politically and militarily harmful within NATO."

The newspaper concluded with a warning tone, saying that if the "incorrect attempts against Germany in the economic field" are not "corrected," then both West Germany and its allies will "suffer irreparable losses."

    美国国防部派官员到波恩
    要西德多买美国军火
    西德报纸不满分担美国驻军费的要求
    新华社波恩3日电　在美国要求西德出钱帮助解救它的国际支付危机未成后，美国政府现在又要加强西德的重新武装，要西德购买更多的美国武器。想用这种办法来从西德身上榨取一笔钱。
    2日从波恩的外交人士方面获悉，包括美国国防部军事援助计划司司长卡斯在内的美国国防部两个高级官员，最近曾在波恩同西德政府举行秘密会谈，要求西德大大增加它在北大西洋集团中的军费份额和从美国购买的武器和军事物资。
    据波恩出版的《议会和政治新闻公报》报道，除了西德已经购买的导弹、雷达设备等之外，美国还要求西德买美国的枪枝、各种型式的摩托车等。
    据波恩报纸透露，美国不仅要西德多买美国的武器，还要西德担负装备北大西洋集团中例如希腊、土耳其等国家军队的费用。而且，美国还要求西德在购买美国武器时预付大笔现金。
    新华社波恩3日电　西德资产阶级报纸对于美国想要西德出钱帮助美国解救国际支付危机的作法，继续表示强烈不满。
    西德垄断资产阶级的报纸《德意志报与经济报》3日在社论中愤愤不平地埋怨美国要求西德增加负担北大西洋侵略集团费用的比重以及要求西德增加发展援助和增加维持美国军队的费用等等。社论说，这是把西德“看成有像地道的毛驴一样的忍耐性”。
    社论反驳《纽约时报》记者苏兹贝格认为西德“油水多”的说法，它强调“无论如何，（西）德国比美、英、法三国都穷”。
    这家报纸要西德的“盟国”不要忘记，西德人口比美国少。“如果它（西德）以18％的比重参加北大西洋公约组织的支出，这就同美国接受70％的比重意味着同样的东西”。
    它还强调说，由西德支付美军占领费“今天不仅对（西德）内政上会有坏处，而且在北大西洋公约组织内部在政治上和军事上都有害而无利”。
    这家报纸最后用警告的口吻说，如果不“纠正在经济方面对德国错误的企图”的话，那么对西德和它的盟国将同样“产生无法补偿的损失”。
