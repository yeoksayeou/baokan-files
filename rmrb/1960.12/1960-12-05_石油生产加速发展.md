    Accelerated Development of Petroleum Production

    Due to the development of industry, transportation, and the increase in agricultural machinery, Poland's consumption of petroleum products is constantly growing. Consumption was 500,000 tons in 1950, and has increased to 2.3 million tons this year. Although the output of refineries has increased from 270,000 tons ten years ago to more than 800,000 tons this year, it is still far from meeting the needs.

    In order to meet production needs, Polish refineries are accelerating their development. During the new Five-Year Plan period (1961-1965), annual refining volume will surge to 3.5 million tons, more than three times this year's volume.

    石油生产加速发展
    由于工业、交通的发展和农业机械的增多，波兰对石油产品的消费正在不断增长。1950年消费五十万吨，今年增为二百三十万吨。虽然炼油厂产量已由十年前的二十七万吨增至今年的八十万吨以上，但仍远不能满足需要。
    为了满足生产需要，波兰炼油厂正在加速发展。在新的五年计划期间（1961—1965年），每年炼油量将激增至三百五十万吨，即比今年增加三倍多。
