Hunan Agricultural College resolutely implements the class line in education and has taken many measures to accelerate the training of agricultural technology personnel from worker and peasant families.

As early as 1958, the college received a group of students recommended by rural people's communes. Most of these students were grassroots cadres and production experts, with rich production knowledge, great enthusiasm, and a strong desire to learn, but their basic theoretical knowledge was relatively low. The Party Committee separately formed these students into "Worker-Peasant Classes," specially studied the teaching plans for the Worker-Peasant Classes, and organized teachers and students to compile a new set of textbooks suitable for Worker-Peasant students. They selected a group of experienced teachers to teach. The Party Committee Secretary also frequently went deep into the classrooms to inspect and supervise, constantly improving teaching. The determination of the Party Committee greatly encouraged all teachers and students. Through the diligent teaching and learning of teachers and students, the students in the Worker-Peasant Classes achieved excellent results in their studies. This year, the number of students from worker-peasant backgrounds admitted to the college has accounted for more than 65% of the total number of students. In April and during the summer vacation, more than 670 worker-peasant children were added to form five Worker-Peasant Classes, and a "preparatory course" was also held.

Based on the new situation of the increased proportion of worker-peasant students this year and the characteristics of worker-peasant students, the college actively reformed teaching methods. Initially, some teachers in the Worker-Peasant Classes had a fear of difficulty, fearing that they would not teach well; some students were afraid that they would not learn well. The Party Committee promptly carried out in-depth political and ideological education among teachers and students, organized teachers and students to study the Party's education policy, and encouraged teachers and students to teach and learn well. It pointed out that worker-peasant students generally have good ideology, great enthusiasm, a strong desire to learn, and love labor. At the same time, they have rich practical production experience and can connect with the masses. These are favorable conditions for teaching and learning well. Through mobilization, the teachers realized the political significance of teaching the Worker-Peasant Classes well and their important responsibilities, and their enthusiasm was greatly increased. They immediately launched a "Five-Good Teacher" competition (good political and ideological work, good teaching, good tutoring, good production labor, and good unity and mutual assistance). In addition to doing a good job in classroom teaching, they also frequently moved among the students, discovered problems, and helped them in a timely manner. Each class also regularly held "Student Symposiums" to solicit students' opinions and constantly improve teaching. Among worker-peasant students, through conducting discussions on "Why do we study?" and organizing them to study Chairman Mao's articles on despising difficulties strategically and paying attention to difficulties tactically, they strengthened their confidence in learning and promoted a style of working hard and studying diligently. In the first semester of this year, 80% of the students in the preparatory class achieved excellent results, creating a record of high academic performance for the entire college. This semester, 95 students have already transferred to the first year of various departments.

The college also actively reformed teaching methods according to the characteristics of worker-peasant students, so that worker-peasant students could understand, thoroughly learn, and use what they learned. In teaching, the method of "combining teaching, production labor, and scientific research" was adopted. By organizing teachers and students to go down to people's communes and farms for internships, combining labor, teaching, and scientific research, theory was better integrated with production knowledge. 80% of the students in the agronomy department's cotton and hemp class are from worker-peasant families. Through the "three-combination" method, they mastered systematic cotton and hemp professional knowledge, successfully tested five new cotton varieties this year, and also successfully tested "grain and hemp intercropping." In classroom teaching, they adhered to the teaching method of focusing on key points, going from shallow to deep, and linking with reality, so as to be easy to understand. In the past, when teaching wheat, seeds, soil, fertilizer, pests and diseases, growth, development, and crop cultivation were taught separately in many classes; now the focus is on key points, with growth and development as the center, and the key to high yield is grasped for teaching, so that students can thoroughly and comprehensively master this knowledge.

### 政治思想工作细致深入　教学密切结合工农特点  湖南农学院加速培养工农子弟

    政治思想工作细致深入　教学密切结合工农特点
    湖南农学院加速培养工农子弟
    本报讯　湖南农学院坚决贯彻教育工作中的阶级路线，采取很多措施，加速培养工农子弟的农业技术人材。
    早在1958年，这个学院接收了一批从农村人民公社保送来的学生。这些学生大部分是基层干部和生产能手，生产知识丰富，干劲大，钻劲足，但基础理论知识比较低。党委将这批学生单独编为“工农班”，专门研究了工农班的教学计划，并组织师生单独编写了一套适合于工农学生学习的新教材，挑选一批经验较丰富的教师任课。党委书记还经常深入课堂进行检查督促，不断改进教学。党委的决心大大鼓舞了全体师生，通过师生勤教勤学，工农班的学生在学习中取得了优异的成绩。今年，这个学院吸收的工农成份学生，已占学生总数的65％以上。4月份和暑假中又分批将六百七十多名工农子弟，增编了五个工农班，并举办了一个“预科”。
    这个学院根据今年工农学生比重增加的新情况和工农学生的特点，积极改革教学方法。开始，工农班部分教师有畏难情绪，怕教不好；有的学生怕学不好。学院党委及时在师生中开展了深入的政治思想教育，组织师生学习了党的教育方针，鼓励师生教好学好。指出工农学生一般都是思想好、干劲大、钻劲足、爱劳动，同时实际生产经验丰富、能够联系群众，这是能够教好、学好的有利条件。通过动员，教师们认识了教好工农班的政治意义和自己的重大责任，积极性大大提高，立即掀起了“五好教师”评比竞赛（政治思想工作做得好，教学好，辅导好，生产劳动好，团结互助好）。他们除搞好课堂教学外，并经常活动在学生中，发现问题，及时帮助。各班还定期召开“学生座谈会”，征求学生意见，不断改进教学。在工农学生中，通过开展“为什么要学习”的讨论，并组织他们学习了毛主席有关在战略上要藐视困难，在战术上要重视困难的文章，坚定了学习信心，发扬了发愤图强刻苦读书的风气。在今年上学期预科班有80％的学生获得了优良成绩，创造了全院学习成绩的高纪录，今年下学期已有九十五人转入各系一年级学习了。
    学院还根据工农学生的特点，积极地改革了教学方法，使工农学生学懂、学透、能用。在教学中，采取了“教学、生产劳动、科学研究三结合”的办法，通过组织师生下放人民公社、农场实习，边劳动，边教学，边进行科学研究，使理论更好地与生产知识结合起来。农学系棉麻班的学生，有80％是工农子弟。他们通过“三结合”的办法，掌握了系统的棉麻专业知识，今年试验成功了五个棉花新品种，还试验成功了“粮麻间作”。在课堂教学中，他们坚持重点突击，由浅入深，联系实际的教学方法，做到通俗易懂。过去讲小麦时，将种子、土壤、肥料、病虫害、生长、发育、作物栽培等分开到很多课里去讲；现在突出了重点，以生长发育为中心，抓住几条丰产关键进行讲授，使学生能够深刻全面地掌握这门知识。（附图片）
