    The Five-Colored Bird
    —Ode to Sino-Cambodian Friendship
    Cheng Guangrui
    I live at the riverhead, you live at the river's end,
    We share the same Lancang River. ①
    The river water is like a mother's inexhaustible milk,
    Nurturing the brothers and sisters of both countries.
    Legend has it that in the first century, in that distant age,
    A five-colored bird flew from Funan's Shuo River, ②
    Flying thousands of miles to the country where the river originates,
    Its beautiful wings sparkling with the light of friendship.
    Since then, the five-colored bird has flown among the people,
    Passing on tales of friendship, how beautiful:
    The first Chinese goose floated in the Mekong River, ③
    The first bud of the "Fan Cha Li" bloomed on Taiwan Island. ④
    Since then, the five-colored bird has flown between the two countries,
    Carrying jewels and silks…
    The South China Sea is filled with sails, ships coming and going like shuttles,
    Weaving a prosperous spring, with beautiful scenery.
    On the land of our two countries' peaceful labor,
    Our ancestors erected a monument to friendship;
    Time has passed with the river, almost two thousand years,
    This monument is even more magnificent, no matter the wind or rain!
    Now, their descendants are using their own hands,
    Planting red flowers and green trees around this monument;
    A new five-colored bird comes with spring again,
    Flying around this monument surrounded by flowers.
    This new five-colored bird is the embodiment of the Five Principles,
    She illuminates the Asian continent with her radiant splendor.
    Today, let us sing a hymn for the five-colored bird,
    Let us raise our glasses for peace and friendship!

    (Note) ① The Lancang River originates in our country and flows south through Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam into the South China Sea; the section outside our country is called the Mekong River.
    ② As early as 84 AD, Cambodia sent envoys to establish relations with the Later Han Dynasty of our country and presented precious animals such as five-colored birds. Funan was the ancient name of Cambodia.
    ③ During the Yuan Dynasty, Chinese sailors first brought Chinese geese to Cambodia for breeding.
    ④ During the Qing Dynasty, Chinese merchants transplanted Cambodian jasmine (commonly known as "Fan Cha Li") to Taiwan, Fujian, and other places.

    五色鸟
    ——颂中柬友谊
    程光锐
    我住在江头，你住在江尾，
    我们共饮澜沧一江水。①
    江水像母亲流不尽的乳汁，
    哺育着两国的兄弟姐妹。
    传说在第一世纪，那久远的年代，
    一只五色鸟从扶南朔江而飞，②
    千里迢迢飞到江水发源的国度，
    美丽的双翼上闪耀着友谊的光辉。
    从此，五色鸟飞翔在人民中间，
    传递着友谊的佳话，多么优美：
    湄公河里飘浮着第一只中国的鹅，③
    台湾岛上发出第一枝番茶莉的蓓蕾。④
    从此，五色鸟飞翔在两国之间，
    衔来了珠宝，衔去了布帛……
    南海上映满帆影，船舶往来如梭，
    织成一片繁荣的春天，风光明媚。
    在我们两国和平劳动的土地上，
    我们的先人竖立起友谊的丰碑；
    时间随着江水逝去，快两千年了，
    这丰碑越加灿烂，哪怕雨打风吹！
    如今，他们的子孙正用自己的双手，
    种植着红花绿树，在这丰碑周围；
    一只新时代的五色鸟又和春天同来，
    环绕着这万花簇拥的丰碑旋飞。
    这新的五色鸟是五项原则的化身，
    她以通身的光彩照耀着亚洲大地。
    今天，让我们为五色鸟唱一支赞歌，
    让我们为和平和友谊举起酒杯！
    （注）①澜沧江发源于我国，南流经缅甸、老挝、泰国、柬埔寨、越南，入南海；我国国境以外一段称湄公河。
    ②早在公元八十四年，柬埔寨即派使者与我国后汉王朝通好，并赠五色鸟等珍贵动物。扶南，柬埔寨古名。
    ③元朝时，我国海员首把中国鹅带到柬埔寨繁殖。
    ④清朝时，我国商人曾把柬埔寨的茉莉花（俗称番茶莉）移植到台湾、福建等地。
