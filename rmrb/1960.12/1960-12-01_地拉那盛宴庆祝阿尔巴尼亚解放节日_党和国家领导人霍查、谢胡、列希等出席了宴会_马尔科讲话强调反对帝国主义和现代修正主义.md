Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, November 30th. The Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and the Council of Ministers held a grand banquet at the "Partisan Palace" in Tirana on the evening of November 29th to warmly celebrate the 16th anniversary of Albania's liberation.

The banquet began at 10:00 PM. When Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, and Mehmet Shehu, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, who had just returned to Tirana from Moscow on the 28th, entered the banquet hall, all those attending the banquet warmly applauded and shouted "Long Live the Albanian Labor Party" and "Long Live Hoxha".

Haxhi Lleshi, Chairman of the Presidium of the Albanian People's Assembly, and other party and government leaders attended the banquet.

Diplomatic envoys from various countries to Albania were invited to attend the banquet. Veteran Albanian partisans, heroes of socialist labor, and advanced workers also attended.

Rita Marko, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, spoke at the banquet. In his speech, Marko warmly congratulated the Albanian people on the victories they had achieved under the leadership of the Labor Party in the sixteen years since liberation. He said, "Albania, formerly a backward agricultural country, has today become an advanced agricultural-industrial country, and it is victoriously and rapidly building a new life, building socialism. Albania is a strong country, an independent and sovereign country, and a loyal member of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union."

Marko said that the Albanian Party and people are one, and the steel-like unity of our people around the Party and Comrade Hoxha—a unity forged in the flames of the struggle for freedom and socialism—is the cornerstone of socialist Albania. Anyone who dares to try to infringe upon this unity in the slightest, as in the past, will be met with utter defeat.

Marko said that the Albanian people, the Party, and our government understand that they must remain unwavering in their loyalty to the motherland, to the glorious party of the great Lenin, and to the unity of the socialist camp and the invincible ideology of Marxism-Leninism, so as not to betray the internationalist assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries. He said that Soviet-Albanian friendship is immortal and cannot be tarnished or infringed upon by anyone. The inviolable friendship and unity with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other fraternal countries of the socialist camp, based on the principles of proletarian internationalism, is the foundation of the foreign policy of the Albanian Republic.

He said that as we celebrate the 16th anniversary of liberation, the forces of peace and socialism are stronger than the forces of war and imperialism, and the world socialist system has become the decisive factor in the development of human society. The magnificent achievements of the Soviet Union, People's China, and other people's democratic countries in all aspects prove the irrefutable superiority of socialism over capitalism. The national liberation struggles of the oppressed colonial peoples have become a surging revolutionary wave against imperialism. However, Marko pointed out that despite this, all events prove that imperialism is still imperialism. It has not abandoned its policy of war and aggression against the socialist camp and other peace-loving and independent countries. As long as imperialism exists, the foundation for wars of aggression exists. Modern revisionists serve imperialism and play a very active role in opposing peace and socialism.

Marko said that from the great October Socialist Revolution to the present day, the experiences of socialist countries have proven that in the struggle to defend and consolidate our historic victories, in the struggle to defend peace and promote the cause of socialism and communism, we socialist countries must maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance and combat readiness while actively striving for peaceful coexistence. Experience has proven that it is necessary to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp with the utmost strength, which is the fortress of peace and the foundation for uniting the people of the world and peace-loving forces. Experience has proven that the aggressive policies and conspiracies of imperialism must be thoroughly exposed, and the main danger of the international communist and workers' movement, modern revisionism, must be exposed and struggled against until it is completely crushed ideologically and politically. Facts have proven that peace and complete and thorough disarmament can only be achieved by forcing imperialism to accept peace and complete and thorough disarmament and mobilizing the entire people to fight for this policy.

He said, "The People's Republic of Albania firmly adheres to the policy of peace and friendship among all nations. We firmly believe that if all the people unite on the basis of vigilance against imperialism and actively fight to the end to defend peace, peace will be defended, and the danger of a new world war will be avoided. The Albanian people are going all out to carry out socialist construction and defend their independence."

The banquet proceeded in a warm atmosphere. Albanian party and government leaders also enjoyed themselves with the veteran partisans, singing revolutionary fighting songs and joyfully participating in group dances.

    马尔科讲话强调反对帝国主义和现代修正主义
    新华社地拉那30日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会和部长会议11月29日晚间在地拉那“游击队之宫”举行盛大宴会，热烈庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放十六周年。
    宴会从晚间十点钟开始。当28日刚从莫斯科返抵地拉那的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记霍查和部长会议主席谢胡进入宴会厅时，出席宴会的全体人员热烈鼓掌欢迎，并高呼阿尔巴尼亚劳动党万岁和霍查万岁。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团主席列希和其他党政领导人都出席了宴会。
    各国驻阿尔巴尼亚的外交使节应邀出席了宴会。阿尔巴尼亚的老游击队员们、社会主义劳动英雄以及先进工作者们也出席了宴会。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员马尔科在宴会上讲了话。马尔科在讲话中热烈地庆贺解放十六年来阿尔巴尼亚人民在劳动党领导下所获得的胜利。他说，“阿尔巴尼亚过去是一个落后的农业国，今天已经成为先进的农业—工业国，它正胜利地并且迅速地建设着新生活，建设着社会主义。阿尔巴尼亚是一个坚强的国家，是一个独立自主的国家，是以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营的忠实成员。”
    马尔科说，阿尔巴尼亚党和人民是一个整体，我国人民在党和霍查同志周围的这种钢铁般的团结——在争取自由和社会主义的战火中锤炼出来的团结，是社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚的基石。像今天一样，将来有谁敢于试图侵犯这种团结的分毫，必将碰得头破血流。
    马尔科说，阿尔巴尼亚人民、党和我国政府懂得要毫不动摇地忠于祖国，忠于伟大列宁的光荣的党，忠于社会主义阵营的团结和战无不胜的马克思列宁主义思想，从而不辜负苏联和其他兄弟国家的国际主义援助。他说，阿苏友谊是不朽的，是任何人所不能沾污和不能侵害的。同苏联、中华人民共和国和社会主义阵营其他兄弟国家建立在无产阶级国际主义原则上的不可侵犯的友谊和团结，是阿尔巴尼亚共和国对外政策的基础。
    他说，在我们庆祝解放十六周年的这个时候，和平和社会主义力量比战争和帝国主义力量更为强大了，世界社会主义体系已成为人类社会发展的决定性因素，苏联、人民中国和其他人民民主国家在各个方面取得的宏伟成就，证明了社会主义对资本主义的不可辩驳的优越性，被压迫的殖民地人民的民族解放斗争已经变成了一个汹涌澎湃的反对帝国主义的革命浪潮。但是，马尔科指出，尽管如此，一切事件都证明帝国主义仍然是帝国主义，它没有放弃对社会主义阵营和其他爱好和平的独立国家的战争政策和侵略政策，只要帝国主义还存在，也就存在侵略战争的基础。现代修正主义者为帝国主义效劳，在反对和平和社会主义方面起着十分积极的作用。
    马尔科说，从伟大的十月社会主义革命直到今天，社会主义各国的经验都证明，在保卫和巩固我们历史性的胜利的斗争中，在保卫和平、推进社会主义和共产主义事业的斗争中，我们社会主义各国在积极争取和平共处的同时，都要保持高度的革命警惕和战斗准备。经验证明，必须以最大的力量加强社会主义阵营的团结，这是和平的堡垒和团结全世界人民和爱好和平力量的基础。经验证明，对帝国主义的侵略政策和阴谋必须彻底揭露，对国际共产主义和工人运动的主要危险现代修正主义必须揭露和斗争，直到从思想上和政治上彻底粉碎它为止。事实证明，只有迫使帝国主义接受和平和全面彻底裁军，动员全体人民为这一政策进行斗争，才可能得到和平和全面彻底裁军。
    他说，“阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国坚决遵循各国人民之间的和平和友谊的政策。我们深信，如果全体人民团结在对帝国主义警惕的基础上，为保卫和平积极斗争到底，和平将会保卫住，新的世界大战的危险将会避免。阿尔巴尼亚人民全力以赴地进行社会主义建设和保卫独立。”
    宴会一直在热烈的气氛中进行。阿尔巴尼亚党政领导人并且和老游击队员们尽兴地在一起高唱革命战斗歌曲和欢乐地参加了集体跳舞。
