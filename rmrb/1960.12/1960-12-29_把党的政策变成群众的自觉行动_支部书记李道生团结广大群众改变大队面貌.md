    Turning the Party's Policies into the Conscious Actions of the Masses
    Branch Secretary Li Daosheng Unites the Broad Masses to Change the Appearance of the Brigade
    (Our Dispatch) Li Daosheng, the Party Branch Secretary of the Sixth Production Brigade of Xiangqiao People's Commune in Rudong County, Jiangsu Province, has united all Party members to lead the masses, promoting continuous bumper harvests in agricultural production, and victoriously resisting this year's extraordinary flood disaster. Currently, winter production is also going very well.
    In leading production over the past few years, in addition to explaining the policies and giving work methods to Party members and cadres when assigning tasks, the Party branch of the Sixth Brigade also established study groups this year. They organized Party members, Youth League members, and cadres to earnestly study the Party's guidelines and policies. Branch Secretary Li Daosheng personally taught the political lessons, once every half month during the busy farming season and once every ten days during the slack season. Each lesson was closely linked to the current work, checking the implementation of policies and conducting policy education. Sometimes, the method of reporting work and asking questions was used for discussion, so that everyone could thoroughly understand the spirit of the policies.
    In early August of this year, precisely during the peak period of mid-season rice heading and cotton boll formation, the brigade suffered an extraordinary flood disaster. All Party members and cadres led the masses, organized cooperation, and rushed to drain the water, rescuing the mature crops. After draining the accumulated water, some cadres and commune members raised questions about the "three guarantees and one reward" policy of the production team. Some teams that were severely affected by the disaster said that the "three guarantees and one reward" policy would be difficult to fulfill. Some teams that were lightly affected also had concerns, fearing that the grain harvested would be balanced and used by the brigade. In order to solve these ideological problems, the Party branch of the brigade immediately convened a branch committee meeting, a branch meeting, and a commune members' meeting. From within the Party to outside the Party, from cadres to the masses, they publicized the Party's policies and organized discussions. The flooded crops were surveyed one by one. Based on the principle that production teams must have output to exceed and rewards to obtain, the "three guarantees and one reward" plan was revised in a timely manner, starting from the actual situation, eliminating the concerns of the masses. The entire brigade immediately launched a super-production competition for planting mid-autumn and late-autumn crops. The fourth production team, with more than 140 commune members, led by team leader Kan Guangxing (a Party member), worked hard for a week. In addition to weeding, topdressing, and processing the 477 mu of flooded rice and 155 mu of cotton, they replanted buckwheat and carrots in more than 20 mu of severely flooded dry land and more than 30 mu of cotton fields. At the same time, they also planted grains and vegetables on the "ten edges" of land. During the autumn harvest, the production team not only achieved increased production in the large fields, but also harvested more than 5,580 jin of grain and more than 50,000 jin of vegetables on the expanded "ten edges" of land, exceeding the revised production target.
    After the autumn harvest, the Party branch of the Sixth Brigade promptly summarized the experience of implementing the "three guarantees and one reward" policy, adhered to the "four fixings" of the production team's land, labor, draft animals, and farm tools, and implemented the "three guarantees" for 1961 as early as possible. During the autumn planting campaign, in order to make the work point quotas reasonable and the work evaluation and scoring timely, Branch Secretary Li Daosheng and Cai Weijin, deputy captain of the seventh production team, commune member Tang Chengwan, and four others conducted trial farming and planting on a 2.8 mu rice paddy field. From the trial planting process, they derived correct bases for how many work points should be set for each farming activity such as plowing, fertilizing, preparing the land, and sowing. Under the influence of Comrade Li Daosheng, the cadres of each production team also invited some commune members to conduct trial work to determine work point quotas. Based on the trial work, each production team promoted the "five fixes" responsibility system of fixing personnel, fixing tasks, fixing time, fixing quality, and fixing work points, so that five days of farm work could be arranged early, work points could be evaluated on the same day, and work point tickets could be issued at any time. In this way, the enthusiasm of commune members for work was even higher. Although the autumn planting area this year was expanded by 15% compared with last year, the sowing task was still completed seven days earlier than last year, and the quality was even better than last year.
    While engaging in agricultural production, the Sixth Brigade also paid great attention to the lives of commune members. This autumn, after achieving increased grain production, the Party branch correctly implemented the grain distribution policy of taking into account the interests of the state, the collective, and the commune members in a balanced and comprehensive manner, promptly weighing and storing the grain, arranging the lives of commune members, setting aside sufficient seeds and feed, and completing the state's grain procurement task of 950,000 jin. The "three guarantees and one reward" policy was implemented, and the bonuses and some of the grain of the super-producing teams were promptly paid out. On the basis of reasonable grain arrangements, each production team, based on the spirit of looking ahead and behind, making up for deficiencies with surpluses, using resources sparingly, and leaving room for maneuver, implemented the method of "quantifying according to people, planning to households, grain to the hall, and savings belonging to oneself." Each canteen also expanded the planting of vegetables, so that commune members could eat fresh vegetables at every meal. The canteen management personnel ensured that commune members' accumulated grain was cashed out once at the end of each month. Whoever saved the grain could use it, and it was all handled by the commune members themselves. Poor peasant commune member Hua Shaoshan happily sang: "Knowing the year's life early, the policy of saving for oneself is good, life is getting better and better, and we are motivated to engage in production."

    把党的政策变成群众的自觉行动
    支部书记李道生团结广大群众改变大队面貌
    本报讯　江苏如东县湘桥人民公社第六生产大队党支部书记李道生团结全体党员带动群众，促进了农业生产连年丰收，胜利地抗御了今年特大的涝灾。目前冬季生产也搞得很好。
    六大队党支部几年来领导生产中，除在布置工作时，向党员和干部讲明政策，交代工作方法以外，今年大队和各生产队还建立了学习小组，组织党、团员和干部认真学习党的方针政策。支部书记李道生亲自担任政治课，农忙时每半月上一次，农闲时每十天上一次。每次上课，都紧密结合当前工作，检查政策执行情况，进行政策教育。有时用汇报工作提问题的方法进行讨论，使大家彻底理解政策的精神。
    今年8月上旬正是中稻孕穗，棉花结桃的旺盛时期，这个大队遭到了特大涝灾，全体党员、干部带领群众，组织协作，突击排涝，抢救了已熟庄稼。排除积水以后，有些干部和社员对生产队的“三包一奖”政策提出了疑问，受灾重的队有人说：“三包一奖”政策难兑现了；受灾轻的队也有人顾虑，怕收的粮食大队要平衡使用。大队党支部为了解决这些思想问题，立即召开支委会、支部会和社员大会，从党内到党外，从干部到群众，宣传了党的政策，并组织讨论。对受涝作物逐块的排队，根据生产队要有产可超、有奖可得的原则，从实际出发，及时修订了“三包一奖”方案，消除了群众疑虑，全大队立即掀起了大种中秋和晚秋作物的超产竞赛。第四生产队一百四十多个社员，在队长阚广兴（党员）带领下，经过一星期时间的努力，除对受涝的四百七十七亩水稻和一百五十五亩棉花进行锄草、追肥，加工培育以外，在受涝严重的二十多亩旱田和三十多亩棉花田里补种了荞麦和胡萝卜。与此同时，又在
  “十边”地上种了粮食和蔬菜。该生产队秋收时，不仅取得了大田增产，而且在扩种的“十边”地上多收了五千五百八十斤粮食和五万多斤蔬菜，超过了修订后的包产指标。
    在秋收后，六大队党支部又及时总结了执行“三包一奖”政策的经验，坚持生产队的土地、劳力、耕畜和农具“四固定”，把1961年的“三包”及早落实下来。在秋种运动中，党支部为了使工分定额合理，评工记分及时，支部书记李道生和第七生产队副队长蔡维金，社员汤承万等六人，在一块二亩八分稻板田里进行试耕试种，从试种过程中，对耕耘、下肥、整地和播种等每项农活应该定多少工分，得出了正确根据。在李道生同志影响下，各生产队干部也都邀集一些社员进行试工，确定工分定额。各生产队在试工的基础上，推行了定人员、定任务、定时间、定质量、定工分的“五定”责任制，做到五天农活早安排，当天工分当天评，随时发给工分票。这样社员的工作积极性就更加高涨，今年秋种面积虽然比去年扩大了15％，但仍比去年提前七天完成了播种任务，质量更比去年好。
    六大队在搞农业生产的同时，还十分关心社员生活。今年秋季取得粮食增产，党支部又正确执行了统筹兼顾，全面安排国家、集体、社员三者利益的粮食分配政策，把粮食及时过秤入仓，安排社员生活，留足种子和饲料，完成了国家九十五万斤的粮食征购任务。执行了“三包一奖”政策，把超产队的奖励金，和部分粮食及时兑现。在粮食合理安排的基础上，各生产队又本着瞻前顾后，以丰补歉，细水长流，留有余地的精神，实行了“以人定量，计划到户，粮食到堂，节约归己”的办法。各个食堂还扩种了蔬菜，使社员每顿都吃到新鲜蔬菜。食堂管理人员对社员积余的粮食，做到每个月底一次兑现，谁积余的粮食归谁使用，一概由社员自行处理。贫农社员花少山高兴地歌颂道：“一年生活早知道，节约归己政策好，生活越过越提高，鼓足干劲把生产搞”。（附图片）
