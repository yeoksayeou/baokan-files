Good Methods of Xinzhudadui Cadres Connecting with the Masses to Promote Production
Concentrating Advanced Experience, Formulating Cadre Pledges

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Party Branch of the Xinzhudadui (New Bamboo Brigade) of Changsheng People's Commune in the suburbs of Chongqing City, Sichuan Province, organized all cadres to formulate cadre pledges, concentrating the fine work style of advanced cadres and fixing it in the form of a pledge, becoming a common standard for all cadres in the brigade to abide by. Since the cadres of the whole brigade have earnestly implemented the pledge, the relationship between cadres and the masses has become closer, promoting the continued leap forward in production.
    Since the communization, many cadres of the Xinzhudadui have maintained the fine work style of "Four Togethers" for a long time, which has been praised by the masses. In order to promote the fine work style of these cadres, this spring, the Party Branch of the dadui mobilized all cadres to summarize the experience of the "Four Togethers." After full discussion, they consciously formulated the cadre pledge of "Three Checks, One Comparison, and Six Dos" as a code of conduct. The content of the "Six Dos" is: Conscientiously study and comprehensively implement the Party's policies, and use persuasive education methods to carry out work; Participate in production labor together with commune members, and fulfill labor quotas; Go deep into the fields to lead production, and discuss matters with commune members; Eat the same food as commune members in the canteen, and lead the management of the canteen well; Be selfless everywhere, and take the lead in running the commune diligently and frugally; Humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, and constantly improve work. The "Three Checks and One Comparison" are several systems to ensure adherence to the "Six Dos," that is, once a month for Party Day, once for cadres to summarize production, and once for mass democratic life activities to check the implementation of the pledge by Party members and cadres; and at the end of each production battle, conduct a comparison of each cadre's implementation of the pledge. In this way, the content of the "Four Togethers" became more specific, and at the same time, a system was formed, further promoting the fine work style of the cadres.
    The result of the Xinzhudadui cadres earnestly implementing this pledge has powerfully promoted production. During the "Four Autumns" production, the difference in work efficiency between the production teams was very large. The Party Branch of the dadui immediately convened a cadre meeting, starting with checking the implementation of the cadre pledge to find the reasons for the difference in work efficiency. The cadres of the Sixth Production Team earnestly implemented the cadre pledge, and according to the opinions of the masses, they organized combat groups, so that production was busy but not chaotic, and the progress was also fast. The Party Branch invited the leader of this team to introduce his experience. After each team learned the experience of the Sixth Team, they established fifty-six temporary "Four Autumns" combat groups, boldly relying on activists to jointly lead production, and the work efficiency generally increased by about one time, so that each production task was completed comprehensively ahead of schedule. The result of cadres earnestly implementing the cadre pledge has also further promoted the fine work style of the cadres. At present, all forty-seven cadres above the level of team leader in the whole brigade maintain the fine work style of eating, living, laboring, and consulting with the masses. When cadres inspect production, they carry hoes and labor manuals, laboring, inspecting, studying, and solving problems at the same time. After the comparison, 70% of the cadres in the brigade have become "Six Good" cadres who implement the pledge, and all sixteen Party members are "Six Good" Party members.
    Since the Xinzhudadui has earnestly implemented the cadre pledge, the masses have also received a vivid education, loved the cadres more, and their enthusiasm for production has been even higher. Among the more than 600 commune members in the brigade, more than 400 have been rated as red banner bearers with high work efficiency and high quality. (Attached picture)

    新竹大队干部联系群众促进生产的好办法
    集中先进经验　制定干部公约
    本报讯　四川省重庆市郊长生人民公社新竹大队党支部，组织全体干部制订干部公约，把先进干部的优良作风加以集中，并用公约的形式固定下来，成为全队干部共同遵守的准则。全队干部认真执行公约以来，更加密切了干部和群众的关系，促进了生产持续跃进。
    公社化以来，新竹大队的许多干部，长期保持着“四同”的优良作风，受到群众赞扬。为了发扬这些干部的优良作风，今年春天，大队的党支部发动全体干部总结“四同”的经验，经过充分讨论，自觉地制订了“三查、一比、六做到”的干部公约，作为行动准则。“六做到”的内容是：认真学习和全面贯彻党的方针政策，用说服教育的方法进行工作；同社员一起参加生产劳动，做足劳动定额；深入田间领导生产，同社员一起商量办事；到食堂同社员吃一样的饭菜，领导办好食堂；处处大公无私，带头勤俭办社；虚心听取群众意见，不断改进工作。“三查、一比”是为了保证坚持贯彻“六做到”的几项制度，这就是一月一次党日、一次干部总结生产和一次群众民主生活活动，检查党员和干部执行公约的情况；并在每个生产战役结束时，对每个干部执行公约的情况，进行一次评比。这样，“四同”的内容就更加具体，同时形成了制度，进一步发扬了干部的优良作风。
    新竹大队干部认真执行这一公约的结果，有力地推动了生产。在“四秋”生产中，各生产小队之间工效差别很大，大队党支部便立即召开干部会议，从检查执行干部公约着手，找寻工效差别的原因。第六小队的干部认真执行了干部公约，并且根据群众的意见，组织了战斗小组，使生产忙而不乱，进度也快。党支部就请这个小队的小队长介绍自己的经验。各个小队学习了六小队的经验后，成立了五十六个临时性的“四秋”战斗小组，大胆依靠积极分子共同领导生产，工效普遍提高一倍左右，使每项生产都全面提前完成。干部认真执行干部公约的结果，还进一步发扬了干部的优良作风。目前，全队小队长以上的四十七个干部，人人都保持着与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量的优良作风。干部在检查生产时，就扛起锄头、带着劳动手册，边劳动、边检查、边研究和解决问题。经过评比，全队70％的干部成了执行公约的“六好”干部，十六个党员全部是“六好”党员。
    新竹大队认真执行干部公约以来，群众也受到了生动教育，更加热爱干部，生产热情也更为高涨。全队六百多个社员中，就有四百多个被评为高工效、高质量的红旗手。（附图片）
