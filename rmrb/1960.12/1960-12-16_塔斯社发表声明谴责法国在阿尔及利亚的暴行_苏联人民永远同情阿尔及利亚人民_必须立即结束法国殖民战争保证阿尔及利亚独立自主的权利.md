Xinhua News Agency, December 15th. TASS Moscow, December 14th: TASS statement on the Algerian issue:

    As everyone knows, French President General de Gaulle has just ended his trip to Algeria. According to the French government's statement, this trip was related to the planned referendum on the issue of "self-determination" and the establishment of interim political institutions there. The events that occurred in Algeria during General de Gaulle's stay revealed the true nature and purpose of the French government's policy and once again made very clear the attitude of the broad masses of the Algerian people towards this policy.

    It was precisely during these days that bloody incidents occurred in major Algerian cities, resulting, according to foreign newspapers, in the deaths of hundreds of Algerians and the injury of thousands. French extremist colonialists, French regular troops, and "security forces," who advocate continuing the war against the Algerian people, which has been going on for more than six years, have massively suppressed Algerians participating in peaceful demonstrations, demonstrations which were carried out under the slogan of a reasonable and peaceful resolution of the Algerian issue on the basis of Algerian self-determination. Tanks and armored vehicles were mobilized against the demonstrators.

    The Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, Abbas, has already appealed to the heads of some countries and the United Nations regarding this incident, calling for the necessary measures to be taken to end the mass slaughter of Algerian residents and to "immediately stop this open act of genocide against the Algerian people." The communique also pointed out that the Arab residential areas in major Algerian cities have been surrounded by French troops, and the residents of these areas, especially the residents of the densely populated Casbah district of the capital Algiers, face the threat of mass extermination.

    The unfortunate events in Algeria clearly prove that the French ruling clique verbally advocates a peaceful resolution of the Algerian issue, and even talks about Algerian "self-determination," but in reality, it is attempting to use force to impose its will on the freedom-loving Algerian people and maintain the colonial system in Algeria.

    The bloody crimes in Algeria are happening precisely when the United Nations is discussing the Algerian issue. These crimes are a provocation to world opinion. This once again confirms that the Algerian issue must be resolved immediately. Now, all peace-loving countries that demand an immediate end to the Algerian war and guarantee the Algerian people's undeniable right to independence and autonomy are working towards this end. The punitive actions taken against the Algerian people have added another shameful page to the history of outdated colonialism, which all progressive mankind is resolutely striving to completely and finally eliminate.

    The large-scale massacre of peaceful Algerian residents has aroused anger throughout the world, including in France.

    The Soviet people's sympathy is always on the side of the people of all countries who are fighting for their freedom and national independence, and always on the side of the heroic Algerian people. The Soviet people firmly condemn the crimes against the Algerian people and demand an end to the repression of Algerian patriots.

    Soviet leaders express their firm belief that, with the joint efforts of all peace-loving countries, it will be possible to stop the bloody colonial war being waged against the Algerian people, which endangers universal peace. The Algerian people should occupy their rightful place in the ranks of the people of free and independent nations.

    塔斯社发表声明谴责法国在阿尔及利亚的暴行
    苏联人民永远同情阿尔及利亚人民
    必须立即结束法国殖民战争保证阿尔及利亚独立自主的权利
    新华社15日讯　塔斯社莫斯科14日讯：塔斯社关于阿尔及利亚问题的声明：
    大家知道，法国总统戴高乐将军刚刚结束了他在阿尔及利亚的旅行。据法国政府的声明，这次旅行是同准备就“自决”问题进行全民投票和在那里建立临时政权机构的计划有关。戴高乐将军逗留期间在阿尔及利亚发生的事件，揭露了法国政府这一政策的真正性质和目的，并再一次十分明确地表现出广大的阿尔及利亚人民群众对这一政策的态度。
    正是在这几天，阿尔及利亚的大城市里发生了流血事件，结果，据外国报纸报道，有数百名阿尔及利亚人死亡，数千名阿尔及利亚人受伤。主张继续对阿尔及利亚人民进行已经打了六年以上的战争的法国极端殖民主义者、法国的正规部队和“保安部队”大规模地镇压参加和平示威游行的阿尔及利亚人，而这些游行是在阿尔及利亚自决的基础上合理地、和平地解决阿尔及利亚问题的口号下进行的。调动了坦克和装甲车对付示威游行者。
    阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯已经就这一事件向一些国家的首脑和联合国呼吁采取必要的措施，以便结束对阿尔及利亚居民的大批屠杀，“立即制止这种反对阿尔及利亚人民的公开的种族灭绝行动”。这项文告中还指出，阿尔及利亚主要城市中的阿拉伯居民区已经被法国军队包围，这些居民区的居民，首先是首都阿尔及尔的人口稠密的卡斯巴区的居民，面临着被大批消灭的威胁。
    阿尔及利亚的不幸事件明确证明，法国统治集团口头上主张和平解决阿尔及利亚问题，甚至谈到阿尔及利亚的“自决”，但是，实际上却企图用武力把自己的意志强加在爱好自由的阿尔及利亚人民身上，在阿尔及利亚保持殖民主义制度。
    阿尔及利亚的流血罪行正是发生在联合国讨论阿尔及利亚问题的时候。这些罪行是对世界舆论的挑衅。这再一次证实，必须立即解决阿尔及利亚问题，现在，要求立即结束阿尔及利亚战争和保证阿尔及利亚人民实现他们的无可争辩的独立自主权利的各爱好和平的国家，都为此而努力。对阿尔及利亚人民采取的讨伐行动，在过时的殖民主义历史上又增添了可耻的一页，整个进步人类正在坚决地争取完全和最后消灭殖民主义。
    对阿尔及利亚和平居民的大规模屠杀，在全世界，包括法国在内，引起愤怒。
    苏联人民的同情永远是在争取自己的自由和民族独立的各国人民这一边，永远是在英勇的阿尔及利亚人民这一边，苏联人民坚决谴责对阿尔及利亚人民的罪行，并要求停止对阿尔及利亚爱国者的镇压。
    苏联领导人表示坚信，只要一切爱好和平国家共同努力，将能够制止对阿尔及利亚人民进行的、危及普遍和平的血腥的殖民主义战争。阿尔及利亚人民应该在自由独立国家的人民行列中占有他们应有的地位。
