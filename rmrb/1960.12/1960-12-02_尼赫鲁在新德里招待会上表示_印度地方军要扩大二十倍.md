    尼赫鲁在新德里招待会上表示
    印度地方军要扩大二十倍
    新华社1日讯　据11月27日出版的孟买《星期日旗帜》周刊报道，印度总理尼赫鲁26日在新德里说，他希望印度地方军的人数发展为现在的二十倍。印度全国各地在26日普遍庆祝了地方军和辅助空军部队成立纪念日。这家周刊说，尼赫鲁在德里市民为地方军和辅助空军部队官员和青年举行的招待会上讲话时说，在这个“十分危险的世界”里，学校和学院里的所有印度青年受军事训练是十分必要的。
    尼赫鲁又说，“为了印度的国防和统一”，印度各阶层人民都应当参加地方军。据这家报纸报道，印度国防部长克里希纳·梅农同一天在孟买也呼吁人民大批参加地方军，以便加强这个国家的“国防第二线”。他说，“设立地方军不是为了摆摆样子的。当国家需要它服务的时候，就将征调它。”
