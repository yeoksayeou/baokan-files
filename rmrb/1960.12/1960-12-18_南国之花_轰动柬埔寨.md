    "Southern Flower" Causes a Sensation in Cambodia
    Zhang Yao, Bai Huizhen
    In subtropical Cambodia, winter is the most pleasant time of the year, and the Water Festival is the most enchanting festival of the year. It was during this auspicious time that the Chinese Chao Opera Troupe, carrying the profound friendship of the Chinese people, arrived in the friendly nation of Cambodia. Just as Peking Opera had captivated Cambodian audiences three years ago, today Chinese Chao Opera is creating a sensation in this friendly neighboring country. From November 1st to December 6th, the Chinese Chao Opera, hailed as the "Southern Flower," was welcomed, praised, and loved throughout Cambodia, earning honor for Chinese art and winning friendship for the Chinese people.
    On the evening of November 1st, the Chinese Chao Opera Troupe performed for the Queen of Cambodia at the Royal Palace, marking the opening of their performances in Cambodia. Queen Kossamak, wearing a satisfied smile, along with more than five hundred members of the royal family and government officials, enjoyed the Chinese Chao Opera that evening. Both the melodious Chaozhou music and the gentle singing and graceful movements of the Chao Opera excerpts were greeted with enthusiastic applause. After the performance, the Queen personally presented medals to the leaders and principal actors of the Chao Opera Troupe.
    It should be said that Chao Opera is not unfamiliar to the Cambodian people. The "Lakhon Bassac" genre, popular in Cambodia, is said by the *Nationalist* weekly to have originated from Chinese Chao Opera. This genre still performs some traditional Chinese plays. Moreover, overseas Chinese residing in Cambodia have long organized many Chao Opera troupes that perform Chao Opera in various places. However, this performance by the Chinese Chao Opera Troupe was the first to fully showcase to Cambodian audiences the moving brilliance of Chao Opera, which has been given new life by the wise policy of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom, weeding through the old to bring forth the new" after the victory of the Chinese people. Therefore, this performance was particularly warmly welcomed and enthusiastically praised.
    Tickets sold out quickly. After the authorities sold "standing room" tickets, hundreds of spectators stood outside the "emergency exit" every night to enjoy the performance. In the open space near the theater, hundreds of people often stood listening to the live performance broadcast from loudspeakers. Demands for the authorities to enable more people to enjoy the Chinese Chao Opera were constantly conveyed through Cambodia's largest official newspaper, *The Nationalist*. When the Chinese Chao Opera Troupe performed its last show in Kampong Cham, the audience surged in, reaching 10,000 people. In Kampong Cham, a city with a population of only 40,000, such a scene was unprecedented.
    During this visit to Cambodia, the Chinese Chao Opera Troupe performed a total of Chao Opera programs such as "Chen San Wu Niang," "Su Liu Niang," "Dang Ma," "Ci Liang Ji," "Tie Gong Yuan," "Lu Lin Hui," and "Sao Chuang Hui," as well as three Chaozhou music programs, which received enthusiastic praise from all sectors of Cambodian society and newspaper editorials. Cambodian Secretary of State for Education Keng Vannsak described the performance in the newspaper as "a major event in the history of Phnom Penh." He said, "This is indeed a performance that the audience loves to see." Pouk Thina, principal of the National School of Drama, told reporters: "I have never seen such a good performance. The actors perform their roles with their whole hearts and all their emotions." "I was completely captivated when I saw the performance for the first time. As an artist, I sincerely thank and praise your performance. You have inherited the essence of Chao Opera and expressed it in a concentrated way." *Cambodia Telegraph* said that the Chao Opera Troupe's fascinating acting "convinced us."
    The friendship expressed by the Cambodian people towards China is unforgettable. From the first day that the Chinese Chao Opera Troupe set foot on Cambodian soil, they received the most friendly and cordial reception. The Queen of Cambodia, Acting Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tep Phan, and Education Minister Chea Cheng, received them successively. The Chao Opera Troupe was invited to participate in the annual Water Festival and share the joy of this national holiday with the Cambodian people; and they were invited to visit many places of interest. When the Chao Opera Troupe went to perform in various parts of Cambodia, they passed through seven provinces. No matter which province they passed through, they were invariably greeted at the provincial border by the Deputy Governor or senior officials of the provincial government from the provincial capital. Upon arrival in the provincial capital, they were greeted by hundreds and thousands of people lining the streets. Whether passing through or staying, the governors of these provinces held banquets or grand receptions to welcome the Chinese guests. When leaving the provincial capital to go to a neighboring province, they were invariably accompanied to the provincial border by the Deputy Governor or the Governor's representative.
    The Chinese Chao Opera Troupe, bearing the mission of cultural exchange, not only introduced Chinese Chao Opera art to the Cambodian people but also did not miss the opportunity to learn from Cambodian artists. Whether in Kep on the coast of the South Sea, Kampong Cham, the city of gardens, or Battambang, on the western border, the actors of the Chinese Chao Opera Troupe held symposiums with Cambodian artists during performance breaks to learn about the characteristics of Cambodian drama and study Cambodian dance and music. Later, at the arrangement of the Queen of Cambodia, the Chinese Chao Opera Troupe sent seven actors, led by Yao Xuanqiu, to the Royal Palace every day to learn Cambodian classical dance. The Queen also sent the most experienced veteran actors to teach the Chinese students. After five or six days of learning, the Queen of Cambodia personally visited the last rehearsal. She praised the Chinese actors for learning quickly, and gave the specially prepared costumes to the Chinese actors and helped them put them on.
    On the evening of December 8th, the Chinese Chao Opera Troupe attended a cultural evening arranged according to the wishes of the Queen of Cambodia. The Royal Dance Troupe, which had visited China, performed two royal dances and two folk dances learned from China -- "Lotus Dance" and "Tea Picking and Butterfly Catching." The moving scene of the Cambodian Royal Dance Troupe performing the "Cambodia-China Friendship Dance" in Beijing was reproduced on the stage. The Cambodian artists sang affectionately:
    "With a feeling of reluctance, we bid farewell to you, friendly China. We will eternally remember you, friendly land and people. You soothe our hearts and warm our feelings. This is a beautiful memory that can never be forgotten."
    The actors waved the national flags of China and Cambodia in their hands, shouting: "Long live China-Cambodia friendship!" The actors of the Chinese Chao Opera Troupe, as the audience, also stood up and applauded enthusiastically again and again.
    Now, the Chinese Chao Opera Troupe has returned to China with the profound friendship of the Cambodian people and their praise for Chinese art. However, as Head of the Troupe Wang Kunlun said in his farewell speech: The Chinese people will always remember that they have good friends and good relatives in Cambodia. (Attached picture)

### “南国之花”轰动柬埔寨

    “南国之花”轰动柬埔寨
    张瑶　白慧贞
    在亚热带的柬埔寨，冬天是一年中最宜人的天气，而送水节又是一年中最迷人的节日。正是在这个佳日佳节的时候，中国潮剧团带着中国人民的深厚友情来到了亲戚之邦的柬埔寨。像京剧三年前曾经使柬埔寨观众倾倒一样，今天中国的潮剧又轰动了这个友好邻邦。从11月1日到12月6日，被誉为“南国之花”的中国潮剧，在柬埔寨广大土地上被欢迎，被赞叹，被热爱，为中国的艺术博得了荣誉，为中国人民赢得了友谊。
    11月1日晚上，中国潮剧团在王宫为柬埔寨王后献演，揭开了在柬埔寨演出的帷幕。科沙玛王后这天晚上带着满意的微笑同五百多王室人员和政府官员一起欣赏了中国的潮剧。无论是婉转悠扬的潮州音乐，还是歌调柔曼、台步轻盈的潮剧片断，都受到了热烈的喝采。演出结束后，王后亲自给潮剧团的负责人和主要演员颁赠和佩带奖章。
    应该说，潮剧对柬埔寨人民并不是陌生的。流行在柬埔寨的一个剧种“洛坤巴塞”，据《民族主义者》周刊说就是来源于中国的潮剧。这个剧种至今还上演一些中国的传统剧目。而旅居柬埔寨的华侨很久以来也组织过不少潮剧班子，在各地上演潮剧。可是这一次中国潮剧团的演出，是第一次向柬埔寨观众充分展示了在中国人民胜利以后，“百花齐放、推陈出新”的英明政策给予新生命的潮剧的动人光采。也就因此，这次演出特别受到衷心的欢迎和热烈赞赏。
    戏票很快就卖完了。当有关当局出售一种“站票”以后，每晚都有上百的观众站在“太平门”外欣赏。而在戏院附近的空地上，还经常有数百人伫立聆听从扩音器播出的演出实况。要求有关当局使更多人能欣赏到中国潮剧的呼声，不断地通过柬埔寨最大的官方报纸《民族主义者》传出来。当中国潮剧团在磅湛演出最后一场时，观众潮涌而至，竟达一万人。在只有四万人口的磅湛市，这种场面是空前的。
    中国潮剧团这次在柬埔寨一共演出了“陈三五娘”、“苏六娘”、“挡马”、“刺梁冀”、“铁弓缘”、“芦林会”、“扫窗会”等潮剧节目和三个潮州音乐节目，获得了柬埔寨各界人士和报纸舆论的热烈好评。柬埔寨教育国务秘书根陶·德蒙特罗在报纸上把这次演出，誉为“金边历史上的一件大事”。他说，“这的确是观众喜闻乐见的演出”。国立戏剧学校校长蒲玉伦告诉记者说：“我还从来没有看到过这样好的表演。演员们是用整个心灵和全部感情来表演自己的角色。”“我在第一次看演出时就完全被吸引住了。作为一个艺术工作者，我衷心感谢和赞扬你们的演出。你们把潮剧的精华承继了下来，而且把它集中表现了出来。”《柬埔寨电讯报》说，潮剧团演员引人入胜的演技“使我们心悦诚服”。
    柬埔寨人民对中国所表达的友情是令人难忘的。从中国潮剧团踏上柬埔寨土地的第一天起，就受到最友好和亲切的接待。柬埔寨王后、代理首相兼外交大臣泰潘和教育大臣谢振国先后予以接见。潮剧团应邀参加了一年一度的送水节，和柬埔寨人民一道共享这个全民节日的欢乐；并且应邀参观访问了许多名胜古迹。潮剧团前往柬埔寨各地演出时，经过了七个省分。不管经过那个省，都毫无例外地在省界上就受到来自省会的副省长或者省政府高级官员的迎接。到达省会时，又受到成百上千群众的夹道欢迎。无论是过境还是留下来，这些省份的省长都举行宴会或者盛大的招待会欢迎中国客人。当离开省会前往邻省时，又毫无例外地由副省长或者省长代表陪送到省界。
    担负着交流文化使命的中国潮剧团，不仅向柬埔寨人民介绍了中国的潮剧艺术，同时也不放松机会向柬埔寨的艺术家们学习。无论在南海之滨的白马，还是在花园城磅湛，或是西部边陲的马德望，中国潮剧团的演员们都在演出空隙和柬埔寨艺术家举行座谈会，向他们了解柬埔寨戏剧的特点和学习柬埔寨的舞蹈和音乐。后来，在柬埔寨王后安排下，中国潮剧团每天派出以姚璇秋为首的七名演员到王宫学习柬埔寨古典舞蹈。王后也派最有经验的老演员教中国学生。经过五、六天的学习，作最后一次排练时，柬埔寨王后亲临参观。她赞扬中国演员们学得很快，还把特别准备的戏装送给中国演员，并帮助她们穿戴。
    12月8日晚上，中国潮剧团出席了根据柬埔寨王后的意旨安排的一次文艺晚会。由曾经访问过中国的皇家舞蹈团表演了两个皇家舞蹈和两个从中国学来的民间舞蹈——“荷花舞”和“采茶扑蝶”。舞台上还重现了柬埔寨皇家舞蹈团在北京上演“柬中友谊之舞”的动人场面。柬埔寨的艺术家们深情地歌唱着：
    “我们以留恋的心情，惜别你友好中国。我们永恒纪念你，友好的土地和人民。你抚慰我们的心，温暖我们的感情。这是美好的记忆，永远也不能忘记。”
    演员们使劲地挥舞着手上的中柬两国国旗，高呼：“中柬友谊万岁！”作为观众的中国潮剧团的演员们也站起来激动地热烈鼓掌再鼓掌。
    现在，中国潮剧团已经带着柬埔寨人民的深厚友情和对中国艺术的赞誉返回中国了。但是，正像王昆仑团长在告别演说中讲的那样：中国人民将会永远记住，他们在柬埔寨有的是好朋友、好亲戚。（附图片）
