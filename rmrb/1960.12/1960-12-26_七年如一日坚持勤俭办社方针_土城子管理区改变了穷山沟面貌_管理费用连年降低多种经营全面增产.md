Following the policy of diligence and frugality in running the commune for seven years as one day, Tuchengzi Management Area has changed the face of a poor mountain gully.
Management expenses decreasing year after year and diversified operations increasing production comprehensively.

(Our Dispatch) The Tuchengzi Management Area of Suiyang People's Commune in Dongning County, Heilongjiang Province, has been transformed from a poor mountain gully into a "granary" due to the hard work of all cadres and commune members, who have been diligently and frugally running the commune for seven years, ever since the establishment of the primary cooperative.

Relying on this "magic weapon"
The Tuchengzi Management Area is a mountainous area that only began reclamation and village construction in 1946. From the establishment of the primary cooperative in 1954, the area earnestly implemented the policy of diligence and frugality in running the commune proposed by the Party. With this "magic weapon," the cadres and commune members further maximized the role of human, material, and financial resources, resulting in year-by-year leaps in production. In 1959, the average per-mu yield of grain crops increased by 11% compared to the bumper year of 1958. In addition to overfulfilling the state grain procurement task of 1,076,300 jin and retaining sufficient seeds, rations, and feed, there was a surplus of grain. Although this year suffered from natural disasters such as spring floods, summer droughts, and autumn floods, the output of grain has still increased by implementing the policy of multiple harvests and high-yield harvests, as well as the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture.

While grain production has increased substantially, diversified operations centered on animal husbandry have also greatly developed. Collective pig raising has increased more than twofold compared to 1958, bees have increased threefold and a half, and sheep have doubled. With the development of production, income has greatly increased. In 1959, the total output value of agricultural and sideline production in the entire management area increased by 34.5% compared to 1958. The proportion of non-production expenditures and operating and management expenses has gradually decreased year by year, with management fees consistently controlled below four per thousand for several years. Total expenditure (including agricultural tax, management fees, and production costs) accounted for 34.9% in 1958 and decreased to 28.4% in 1959. As a result, the public accumulation increased appropriately each year, and it was also guaranteed that more than 90% of the commune members increased their income.

The Tuchengzi Management Area used to be very poor, but because of its ambition, production developed rapidly. After production developed and living standards gradually improved, they did not forget their roots and continued to adhere to diligence and frugality in everything they did, at all times. For example, after the establishment of the people's commune in 1958, some cadres and commune members saw that the commune's production scale was large and its economic strength was strong, so they thought, "Now that the family business is big, there is no need to be so meticulous," and advocated building a club and replacing all the livestock with new ropes and new equipment. However, the majority of cadres and commune members believed that the family business was built through diligence and frugality. Although it was stronger than in the past, it still needed to be even stronger, and diligence and frugality should be maintained at all times. They said, "Building a family is as difficult as picking soil with a needle, while ruining a business is as easy as sand being washed away by waves. Only by diligently engaging in production and living frugally can we guarantee the continuous development of production and the step-by-step improvement of living standards." The Party branch supported this view and organized cadres and commune members to discuss the need to maintain and carry forward the spirit of diligence and frugality in running the commune that was present during the primary cooperative, quickly dispelling the erroneous ideas of some cadres and commune members who advocated ostentation, and consolidating the idea of always adhering to the policy of diligence and frugality in running the commune.

Sound systems strengthen management
The Tuchengzi Management Area not only adhered to the policy of diligence and frugality in running the commune ideologically, but also specifically and practically implemented the spirit of diligence and thrift in its management work, establishing and improving necessary systems to ensure that human, material, and financial resources were used where they were most needed. On the basis of implementing the "Four Fixes" and "Three Guarantees and One Reward," each production team in the entire management area arranged labor according to individual strengths and weaknesses and the importance of the work. They not only used male and female strong laborers in the front line of agricultural production during the busy farming season, but also maintained more than 75% of the labor force participating in grain production throughout the year; commune members with special technical skills and general laborers were engaged in diversified operations; and the elderly, weak laborers, and women who could not work in the fields were responsible for welfare and miscellaneous tasks. At the same time, each production stage achieved skillful use of forces, ensuring the center while taking care of all aspects. During the summer hoeing season this year, all seven production teams concentrated more than 90% of their labor force to attack weeding vigorously. When the peak season for the production of local specialties in the mountainous area arrived, 40% of the labor force was promptly organized to carry out the "small autumn harvest" movement. In labor management, because the system of evaluating work and recording points and distributing according to labor was implemented under the premise of adhering to political command, the enthusiasm of commune members for diligent production was greatly encouraged. Since the beginning of this year, more than 80% of the commune members have achieved full attendance every month.

In order to adapt to the continuous development of production, the increasing number of receipts and expenditures, and the gradual increase in the amount of materials that needed to be stored, the Tuchengzi Management Area further strengthened financial management and improved the systems for financial affairs, accounting, cash management, and material management. Over the years, all payments of funds and materials have had procedures and vouchers, achieving consistency between accounts and goods, accounts and vouchers, and accounts and accounts. In daily production and life, the practice of replacing the new with the old and making things themselves was widely adopted, saving expenses in all aspects. More than 100 sacks in the entire management area were mended when broken, and continued to be used after being mended. With regard to cash management, in addition to strictly implementing the expenditure approval system, money and accounts were managed separately, achieving daily clearing and monthly settlement of accounts; labor work point accounts were based on the production team, and were posted monthly for public review. The financial income and expenditure of the management area and the economic exchanges of commune members were also announced in the canteen every quarter, which facilitated mass inspection and supervision, and everyone was clear about the figures.

The public property of this management area is managed in an orderly manner, not chaotic despite the large quantity. Agricultural implements are stored in warehouses, grain is stored in granaries, storage is handled by dedicated personnel, and there are procedures for entering and leaving the warehouses, with records of everything. There are a total of 32 granaries in the entire management area, storing seeds, feed, and rations separately. Each warehouse has a registration form affixed to it, recording the date, quantity, type, and unit of grain entering and leaving the warehouse. Since the establishment of the primary cooperative, there has not been a single mistake. Because there are dedicated personnel responsible for regular inspections, grain storage has been achieved without insects, sparrows, mice, or mildew. The use of tools is better cared for by the commune members, because the system of fixing people, fixing items, fixing repair procedures, and fixing service life is implemented. The draft animal keeper, Zhou Qingbao, has used a set of reins for three years.

Good household managers
The cadres' hard work, simplicity, and dedication are an important reason why the Tuchengzi Management Area has been able to adhere to the policy of diligence and frugality in running the commune for a long time. Eighteen of the 25 cadres above the level of production team leader in the management area are poor and lower-middle peasants; all the cadres work diligently, participate in production diligently, and set an example. Because there is more land and less animal power, and there was a lot of rain this spring, some commune members were worried about abandoning the land and advocated rushing the progress, disregarding quality. At this time, the Party branch secretary, director, and branch committee members and management committee members went deep into the production teams, on the one hand to help the production team cadres to come up with ideas and methods, and on the other hand to work with the commune members to rush to plant in the heavy rain. As a result, all the ripe land was planted before Xiaoman (Grain Full), and more than 220 mu of wasteland was reclaimed and sown. In addition to adhering to the "Four Togethers," Party branch secretary Ying Lizhi cherishes every needle, every thread, every grass, and every tree in the management area. When he goes to the commune for meetings, which is more than 30 li away, he does not take the bus or stay in a hotel. Because he is diligent, thrifty, and studious, the commune members call him the "Three Diligences" Secretary. Warehouse keeper Li Caimao is also one of the respected figures of the commune members. In the past seven years, the grain he has kept has never had a case of mold, no grain has been spilled on the ground, and there have been no insects or rats in the warehouse; the agricultural implements he keeps are in order and undamaged. None of the cadres above the level of production team leader in the entire management area owe money to the management area or embezzle public funds. This group of loyal housekeepers has won the trust of the masses. The commune members say: "There are rakes for collecting money outside, and coffers for storing money at home, so we have 120 hearts, and we can put them down."

    七年如一日坚持勤俭办社方针
    土城子管理区改变了穷山沟面貌
    管理费用连年降低多种经营全面增产
    本报讯　黑龙江省东宁县绥阳人民公社土城子管理区，全体干部和社员发愤图强，埋头苦干，从办初级社起，七年如一日地坚持勤俭办社方针，使穷山沟变成了“粮食囤子”。
    凭着这个“法宝”
    土城子管理区是从1946年才开始开荒建村的一个山区。从1954年建立初级社起，就认真地贯彻了党提出的勤俭办社方针。这里的干部和社员凭着这个“法宝”，更大地发挥了人力、物力、财力的作用，使生产年年跃进。1959年，粮食作物平均亩产比大丰收的1958年提高11％，除超额完成了国家一百零七万六千三百斤征购粮任务和留足种子、口粮、饲料以外，还有余粮。今年虽然遭受春涝、夏旱和秋涝等自然灾害的侵袭，但由于贯彻执行了多种多收和高产多收的方针与农业“八字宪法”，粮食产量仍然有增加。
    在粮食产量大幅度增长的同时，以畜牧业为中心的多种经营也有了很大发展。集体养猪比1958年增加两倍多，蜜蜂增长了三倍半，羊翻了一番。随着生产的发展，收入大大增加。1959年全管理区农副业总产值比1958年提高34.5％。非生产开支和经营管理费用所占的比例逐年减少，几年来管理费一直控制在千分之四以下。1958年总支出（包括农业税、管理费、生产费）占34.9％，1959年降到28.4％，这样，就使每年提出的公共积累都有适当增加，并且还保证了社员90％以上都增加了收入。
    土城子管理区过去很穷，因为穷得有志，生产迅速发展。在生产发展，生活逐步改善之后，他们没有忘本，仍然坚持事事勤俭、时时勤俭。比如在1958年成立人民公社以后，个别干部和社员看到公社生产规模大，经济力量雄厚，就认为“现在家业大了，不必再精打细算了”，主张盖俱乐部，牲口都换上新绳套、新家什。但是大多数干部和社员认为：家业是勤俭治起来的，虽然比过去强了，但是还要它更强，什么时候都应勤俭。他们说：“兴家难如针挑土，败业易如浪淘沙，只有勤恳搞生产，精打细算过日子，才能保证生产不断发展，生活步步提高。”党支部支持了这种意见，并组织干部和社员讨论了要保持和发扬初级社时那种勤俭办社的精神，迅速打消了一部分干部和社员讲排场的错误想法，巩固了永远坚持勤俭办社方针的思想。
    健全制度加强管理
    土城子管理区不但在思想上坚持了勤俭办社的方针，而且还在经营管理工作上具体切实地贯彻了克勤克俭的精神，建立和健全了必要的制度，使人力、物力、财力都用到了最需要的地方。全管理区在执行“四固定”和“三包一奖”的基础上，各生产队都根据人有强弱，活有主次，因人制宜地安排劳动力。他们不但农忙季节把男女强壮劳动力用于农业生产第一线，就是常年也保持有75％以上的劳动力参加粮食生产；搞多种经营的是有技术特长的社员和一般的劳动力；生活福利和杂活等，则由一些老弱劳动力和不能下地的妇女去做。同时，每个生产阶段都做到了巧用兵力，保证中心，照顾全面。今年夏锄时期，七个生产队都集中了90％以上的劳动力，猛攻铲趟。到了山区土特产生产旺季，便及时组织了40％的劳动力，开展了“小秋收”运动。在劳动管理上，由于在坚持政治挂帅前提下，实行了评工记分按劳分配，大大鼓舞了社员勤劳生产的积极性。今年以来，有80％以上的社员达到了月月满勤。
    为适应生产不断发展，收支日益繁多，需要保管的物资逐渐增加的情况，土城子管理区进一步加强了财务管理，健全了财务、会计、现金管理和物资管理制度。几年来，所有款项和实物的支付，都有手续，有凭据，做到了账物相符、账据相符、账账相符。在日常生产和生活中，广泛采取了以旧代新和自己制作的办法，从各方面节约开支。全管理区一百多条麻袋，坏了又补，补了继续使用。对于现金管理，除严格执行开支审批制度外，钱账分管，做到账目日清月结；劳动工分账以生产队为单位，月月张榜公布。管理区的财务收支、社员经济往来，也都按季在食堂公布，便于群众检查、监督，人人胸中有数。
    这个管理区的公共财产，管理的井井有条，多而不乱，农具有库，粮食有仓，保管有专人，出入库有手续制度，样样有记载，件件有着落。全管理区共有三十二个粮仓，分别保管着种子、饲料、口粮。每个仓库都贴有一个登记表格，记载着出入库粮食日期、数量、种类和单位。从成立初级社以来，没有发生一笔差错。由于有专人负责，经常检查，还实现了粮仓无虫、无雀、无鼠、无霉烂。工具的使用，因为实行定人、定件、定修理手续、定使用年限的制度，社员更加爱护。使役员周清宝，一个套包子就使了三年。
    好当家的
    干部艰苦朴素、兢兢业业，是土城子管理区能够长期坚持勤俭办社方针的一个很重要的原因。管理区二十五名生产队长以上的干部，有十八名是贫农和下中农；全体干部都踏踏实实地进行工作，勤勤恳恳地参加生产，以身作则，一丝不苟。因为地多畜力少，今年春季雨水多，有的社员担心扔地，主张抢进度，不顾质量。这时，支部书记、主任以及支部委员、管理委员等都分别深入生产队，一方面帮助生产队干部出主意想办法，一方面和社员一起顶着大雨抢种，结果在小满前就种完了全部熟地，还开荒播种了二百二十多亩荒地。党支部书记英立志除了坚持“四同”，对管理区的一针一线、一草一木都非常珍惜。他到公社开会一去三十多里，来回不坐汽车，不住旅社。因为他勤劳、勤俭、勤学习，社员称他为“三勤”支书。保管员李才茂，也是社员尊敬的人物之一。七年来，他保管的粮食，从没发生过一次霉烂，地不撒粮，仓无虫鼠；他保管的农具有条有理，无一丢损。全管理区的生产队长以上的干部，不欠管理区的钱，不占用公款。这批忠心耿耿的管家人赢得了群众的信任。社员说：“外面有搂钱耙子，家里有装钱匣子，我们有一百二十个心，也能放得下。”
