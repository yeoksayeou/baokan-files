The Somali Republic is located on the Somali Peninsula in eastern Africa, known as the "Horn of Africa." It is bounded by the Indian Ocean to the east, Ethiopia to the west, and Kenya to the south, with a total land area of approximately 700,000 square kilometers and a population of over 1.9 million. The residents are mainly Somalis, who adhere to Islam.

Prior to the 1880s, the entire Somali Peninsula was a unified country. After 1883, it was successively occupied by imperialist powers such as France, Britain, and Italy and divided into three colonies. The Somali people waged a long and unyielding struggle for national liberation and unification. On June 26 and July 1 this year, British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland successively declared their independence. On the very day that Italian Somaliland declared its independence, the parliaments of the two countries held a joint session and announced the merger of the two countries to form the Somali Republic.

    索马里共和国
    索马里共和国位于非洲东部号称“非洲之角”的索马里半岛上。它东濒印度洋，西邻埃塞俄比亚，南接怯尼亚，共有约七十万平方公里土地和一百九十多万人口。居民主要为索马里人，信奉伊斯兰教。
    在十九世纪八十年代之前，整个索马里半岛原是一个统一的国家。1883年以后，才先后被法、英、意等帝国主义占领，并瓜分为三个殖民地。索马里人为了民族解放和统一，曾经进行了长期的不屈不挠的斗争。今年6月26日和7月1日，英属索马里兰和意属索马里兰先后宣告独立。就在意属索马里兰宣告独立的当天，两国议会举行了联席会议，宣布两国合并，成立索马里共和国。
