The system of three-level ownership with the production team as the foundation is the fundamental system of the rural people's commune at the present stage. Strengthening the basic ownership of the production team is the central link in further consolidating the rural people's commune and further developing agricultural productive forces.

The people's commune is the basic social organization of our country. It has a large organizational scale and a wide range of activities. This organizational form can accommodate the development level of productive forces in different periods of socialist society, and even the development level of productive forces in communist society, and the relations of production adapted to the productive forces. In the course of its development, the people's commune system must be divided into several stages that are both connected and different, due to the different levels of development of productive forces and relations of production. From the overall development process, it can be divided into two major stages: socialism and communism. In the socialist stage, it is further divided into two stages: socialist collective ownership and socialist public ownership. In the collective ownership stage, it is further divided into the stage of basic ownership by the production team and the stage of basic ownership by the commune. The people often say: "Communism is heaven, and the people's commune is a ladder to heaven." "Heaven" is our highest ideal, and the "ladder to heaven" must be climbed step by step. At present, the people's commune is in the stage of basic ownership by the production team in the stage of socialist collective ownership. It still needs considerable efforts and the creation of necessary conditions to transition from this stage to the next.

Three years of experience have increasingly clearly proven that when the development of productive forces has broken through the boundaries of agricultural production cooperatives with a small organizational scale and a narrow scope of activities, it is necessary to promptly reform the relations of production of agricultural cooperatives and establish people's communes with a large organizational scale and a wide scope of activities. If we had not promptly established a new relationship of production—the people's commune—and advanced the socialist revolution to a new stage, further liberating and developing productive forces, then we would never have been able to achieve such great achievements in agricultural production in the past two years under the continuous attacks of severe natural disasters. In the struggle against disasters, the people's commune has experienced severe tests and exercises, and has grown stronger.

We are both adherents of the theory of continuous revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development. When the relations of production hinder the development of productive forces, we change the relations of production to promote the development of productive forces; when the relations of production have been adapted to the development of productive forces through reforms, we must consolidate and stabilize this new relationship of production, which is conducive to the further development of productive forces. After a considerable period of time, when productive forces have developed to a new and higher level and certain conditions are met, it is necessary and possible to reform the relations of production again and enter the next stage of revolutionary development. Entering the next stage from each stage requires the necessary conditions. The resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party clearly pointed out: "The timing of the transition from collective ownership to public ownership depends on the level of production development and the level of people's awareness, which are objective realities, and cannot be subject to people's subjective wishes, being delayed or advanced at will." Conditions take a considerable amount of time to mature. Strengthening the basic ownership of the production team and adhering to the system of three-level ownership with the team as the foundation at the present stage is precisely to create these conditions faster and better.

The decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the establishment of people's communes in rural areas in August 1958 stipulated that the management committees of large communes (communes) should first be jointly selected by the original small cooperatives (advanced agricultural cooperatives) to uniformly plan and deploy work, and the original small cooperatives should be changed into production teams, and the original set of production organization and management systems should remain temporarily unchanged. In December 1958, the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on several issues concerning people's communes clearly stipulated that people's communes should implement a system of unified leadership and hierarchical management, and stipulated that they can generally be divided into three levels: the commune management committee, the production team (that is, the basic accounting unit), and the production brigade (that is, the basic unit for organizing labor). Subsequently, in March 1959, the Central Committee of the Party further clarified that communes should implement "three-level management, three-level accounting, and base accounting on the team." That is to say, the ownership of the production team is still the main foundation of the commune. Why is this stipulated? This is because this stipulation is precisely suitable for the development level of productive forces and the level of awareness of the commune members, and at the same time, it is most conducive to further developing productive forces and improving the level of awareness of the masses.

The speed and height of the current development of agricultural productive forces in our country are unprecedented compared with the past. However, from a general point of view, the current level of development of our agricultural productive forces is still very low. People's communes already have some modern and large-scale economies operated by the commune, but they still account for a very small proportion of the economies at all levels of the entire people's commune. The strength of the production team has indeed been greatly strengthened compared with the past, but the economic conditions between the teams have not yet reached relative equilibrium, and the level of production development varies greatly. Under this circumstance, on the one hand, the existence of commune partial ownership can accommodate and promote the further development of productive forces; on the other hand, establishing and strengthening the basic ownership of the production team and adhering to the small partial ownership of the production brigade adapts to the current basic situation of productive forces, which can also greatly promote the further development of productive forces. Adhering to the system of three-level ownership with the team as the foundation is also very necessary for educating the broad masses of peasants. When peasants see that collective production has greatly developed, commune members' income has greatly increased, and the level of agricultural mechanization has greatly improved, they will more deeply appreciate the superiority of larger-scale collective operations. At the present stage, the production team equivalent to the original advanced cooperative is the foundation, with an average of two to three hundred households per team, and several hundred households in some cases. Production labor and income distribution are basically carried out within this range, which not only takes into account the original habits of the commune members, but also facilitates further improvement of their level of collectivist thinking. In short, the three-level ownership with the team as the foundation takes into account the differences in the production level and income level of each team, and facilitates the unified leadership and organization and coordination of the commune; it is not only conducive to accelerating agricultural production and the development of the entire national economy at present, but also conducive to creating material and spiritual conditions for the gradual transition in the future.

Ownership is the decisive link in the relations of production. The right to manage and operate is one of the most important aspects of ownership. Whether labor and means of production are truly owned by someone mainly depends on whether they have the right to dispose of and use these labor and means of production. At the present stage, it is particularly important to maintain and strengthen the production and management rights of the production team. At present, agricultural production in our country mainly relies on manual labor; the natural environment, crop characteristics, and technical conditions vary greatly from place to place, and it is impossible to formulate unified and specific production plans and technical measures from top to bottom on a large scale like industrial production, and carry out production according to uniform requirements. In order to give full play to people's initiative and enthusiasm in production and make full use of favorable weather and geographical conditions, the right to manage and operate production must be mainly given to the production team. The commune's production plan must be based on the production plans of the production team and the contracted output plan of the production brigade. The crop arrangement, output targets, and technical measures should be discussed by the commune members and jointly formulated by the production team and the production brigade, with the commune members being the masters of their own affairs. Of course, the commune has the right to make suggestions to the production team based on the national plan, and to make necessary and reasonable balances and adjustments to the plans proposed by each production team, but it must never subjectively and rigidly arrange crop areas, arbitrarily increase output targets, and rigidly stipulate technical measures without considering the actual situation and without listening to the opinions of the production team, brigade, and commune members. It is even more not allowed to arbitrarily transfer the labor force and means of production of the production team. In special circumstances, when the commune or other production teams need to use the labor force and means of production of a certain production team, they must also carry out equivalent exchange cooperation under the principle of voluntary mutual benefit and on the premise of not hindering the needs of that production team itself, and it must be approved by the higher-level authorities in accordance with regulations.

There must be a product distribution system that matches the ownership system. At the present stage, the main means of production in the people's commune are basically owned by the production team, and the products must also be basically distributed by the production team. If the distribution system is not adapted to the basic ownership of the production team, the maintenance and strengthening of the basic ownership of the production team will fail. The agricultural products and other operating income harvested by the production brigade, within the scope of the contracted output task, must be truthfully turned over to the production team for unified distribution; a portion of the overproduction should also be turned over according to the prescribed ratio for unified distribution by the production team. All the income of the production team (including the income operated at the team level and the income turned over by each brigade), in addition to paying national taxes and turning over a certain amount of public accumulation funds to the commune in accordance with regulations, the rest is distributed within each production team, and each production team calculates its own profits and losses. The production team should withdraw a certain percentage (for example, about 5%) of public accumulation funds and public welfare funds in accordance with the commune's regulations, deduct production costs, working capital, and other necessary expenses, and then distribute the rest to the production brigade according to the method of contracting output, contracting work, contracting costs, and rewarding overproduction. After ensuring the completion of the state's unified purchase plan and retaining sufficient self-use parts in accordance with regulations, the surplus part of the grain can be sold more or stored by the production team itself, and the retained self-use part is uniformly managed by the production team; industrial raw material crops and non-staple foods should be sold more if there is a surplus after completing the state's unified purchase plan and retaining the self-use part in accordance with regulations, and the cash should be distributed within the team.

Maintaining and strengthening the production team's ownership, management rights, and distribution rights absolutely does not mean weakening the collective strength of the people's commune, but precisely strengthening the material foundation of the people's commune's large collective. The commune-run economy is the leading component of the entire people's commune economy, representing the great hope and great future of the people's commune, and it should continue to develop. However, this part of the economy should mainly rely on its own strength and develop with the help of the state, and should not rely on extracting excessive accumulation from the production team, or transferring excessive labor and means of production from the production team, using the method of weakening the team-owned economy to develop. The development of the commune-run economy should be based on whether it is conducive to agricultural production and should serve agricultural production. The development of the people's commune's commune-run economy must be based on the great development of the economy of each production team. The production team is the foundation of the people's commune, and the stronger the foundation, the more promising and hopeful the development of the commune-run economy.

Maintaining and strengthening the basic ownership of the production team is also in the fundamental interests of the production brigade. The main part of the income of the commune members (currently generally about 80%) comes from the collective economy of the entire production team; completing the contracted output task and striving for overproduction is the primary task of each production brigade and all commune members. The production brigade should have a small part of ownership. That is: on the premise of completing the contracted output task, the brigade has the right to operate various productions within its own scope, especially operating the household production of the canteen, and has the right to independently dispose of the overproduction reward part and the cost-saving part. Land, draught animals, and farm tools are fixed in the brigade for the brigade to use, and the labor force is also fixed in the brigade. The production team and the commune should not change them at will; before the end of a production year, labor force, land, draught animals, and farm tools must not be transferred from the brigade. This small part of ownership of the brigade and the right to fixed use of the means of production are not only of great significance to the production of the brigade, but also of great significance to the development of the entire rural economy, especially the development of the agricultural economy.

The commune-owned economy, the team-owned economy, and the brigade economy are interconnected and mutually promote each other, and must develop together; at the present stage, focusing on ensuring the development of the team-owned economy is the central link in the common development of the three-level economy. The commune level and the production brigade level should maintain and strengthen the basic ownership of the production team from both the top and bottom, and should not weaken the basic ownership of the production team from both ends.

Since strengthening the basic ownership of the production team has such great significance at the present stage, we must make the allocation of our leadership force adapt to this policy. Therefore, while ensuring the due basic rights of the production team and giving full play to the initiative of the production team, we must also strengthen the leadership force of the production team. The vast majority of cadres sent down from all levels should be placed in the production team and the production brigade; cadres at the commune level should spend most of their time and energy working in the production team and the production brigade, especially strengthening the leadership of the production team and the production brigade with a relatively weak work foundation.

For more than two years, the people's commune has gained rich experience in implementing the fundamental system of unified leadership, hierarchical management, three-level ownership, and team as the foundation. Now, if we can summarize and carry forward these experiences well, we will surely be able to further strengthen the foundation of the people's commune, further give play to the superiority of the people's commune, further mobilize the enthusiasm of the communes at all levels and all commune members, further set off a high tide of running agriculture in a big way and running grain in a big way, and further strengthen the foundation of the entire national economy, so as to create more favorable conditions for the rapid development of our country's socialist construction cause.

    三级所有队为基础是现阶段人民公社的根本制度
    以生产队为基础的三级所有制是现阶段农村人民公社的根本制度。加强生产队的基本所有制，是当前进一步巩固农村人民公社和进一步发展农业生产力的中心环节。
    人民公社是我们国家的基层社会组织，它具有较大的组织规模和较广阔的活动范围，这种组织形式可以容纳社会主义社会的不同时期的生产力的发展水平，以至共产主义社会的生产力发展水平，和与生产力相适应的生产关系。人民公社制度在它的发展的道路上，因生产力和生产关系的发展水平不同，又必须要划分为几个既相衔接又有差别的阶段。从总的发展过程来说，要分为社会主义和共产主义两个大的阶段。在社会主义阶段，还要分为社会主义的集体所有制和社会主义的全民所有制两个阶段。在集体所有制阶段，还要分为生产队基本所有制的阶段和公社基本所有制的阶段。人民群众常说：“共产主义是天堂，人民公社是天梯”。“天堂”是我们的最高理想，到达“天堂”的“天梯”是要一段一段攀登上去的。现在，人民公社处于社会主义的集体所有制阶段中的生产队基本所有制的阶段。还须经过相当长时期的努力，创造必要的条件，才能从这个阶段过渡到下一个阶段。
    三年来的经验已经越来越清楚地证明：当生产力的发展已经突破了组织规模较小和活动范围较窄的农业生产合作社的界限的时候，必须及时地变革农业合作社这种生产关系，建立组织规模大和活动范围广的人民公社。如果不是及时地建立了新的生产关系——人民公社，把社会主义革命推进到一个新的阶段，进一步解放和发展生产力，那末，近两年在严重的自然灾害连续袭击下，我们绝不可能在农业生产方面取得这样巨大的成就。在抗灾斗争中，人民公社经历了严重的考验和锻炼，成长得更加坚强。
    我们既是不断革命论者，同时又是革命发展阶段论者。在生产关系阻碍着生产力的发展的时候，我们变革生产关系，促进生产力的发展；在生产关系经过变革已经同生产力的发展相适应的时候，又必须使这种新的生产关系巩固和稳定起来，这才有利于生产力的进一步发展。经过相当长的时间，当生产力发展到一个新的更高的水平，具备了一定的条件的时候，才有必要和可能再变革生产关系，进入下一个革命发展阶段。从每一个阶段进入下一个阶段，都需要具备必须具备的条件。党的八届六中全会决议中曾经明确地指出：“集体所有制向全民所有制过渡的迟早，取决于生产发展的水平和人民觉悟的水平这些客观存在的形势，而不能听凭人们的主观愿望，想迟就迟，想早就早。”条件是要经过相当长的时间才能成熟的。在现阶段加强生产队基本所有制，坚持三级所有、队为基础的制度，正是为了更快更好地创造这些条件。
    1958年8月中共中央关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议中就规定：首先由原来各小社（高级农业社）联合选出大社（公社）的管理委员会，统一规划部署工作，把原来的各小社改为生产队，原来的一套生产组织和管理制度暂时不变。1958年12月党的八届六中全会关于人民公社若干问题的决议中明确规定：人民公社应当实行统一领导、分级管理的制度，并且规定一般可以分为公社管理委员会、生产队（即基本核算单位）、生产小队（即组织劳动的基本单位）三级。随后，1959年3月，党中央进一步明确规定：公社应当实行“三级管理，三级核算，并且以队的核算为基础。”也就是说生产队的所有制目前还是公社的主要基础。为什么要这样规定呢？这是因为这样规定恰恰适合生产力的发展水平和社员群众的觉悟水平，同时又最有利于进一步发展生产力和提高群众的觉悟水平。
    当前我国农业生产力发展的速度和达到的高度，比起我国过去的情况来，是前所未有的。但是，从总的方面看来，目前我们的农业生产力的发展水平毕竟还是很低的。人民公社已经有了一些社营的现代化的较大型的经济，但是在整个人民公社各级经济中占的比重还很小。生产队的力量也的确比过去是大大加强了，但是各队之间经济条件仍然没有达到相对的平衡，生产发展水平相差很大。在这种情况下，一方面，公社部分所有制的存在，可以容纳和促进生产力的进一步发展；另一方面，确立和加强生产队基本所有制，并坚持生产小队的小部分所有制，又适应目前生产力的基本状况，从而也可以大大促使生产力的进一步发展。坚持实行三级所有、队为基础的制度，对于教育广大农民来说也是非常必要的。当农民看见集体生产有很大的发展，社员收入有很大的增加，农业机械化的水平有很大的提高，他们就会更深刻地体会到更大规模集体经营的优越性。现阶段以相当于原高级社的生产队为基础，一个队平均二百几十户，多的几百户，生产劳动和收益分配基本上在这个范围内进行，既照顾了社员群众原有的习惯，也便于进一步提高他们的集体主义的思想水平。总之，队为基础的三级所有制，既照顾了各个队的生产水平和收入水平的差别，又便于公社的统一领导和组织协作：既有利于目前加快农业生产和整个国民经济的发展，又有利于为将来逐步过渡创造物质条件和精神条件。
    所有制是生产关系的决定环节。经营管理权是所有权的一个最重要的方面。劳动力和生产资料是不是真正归谁所有，主要看是不是有权支配和运用这些劳动力和生产资料。在现阶段，维护和加强生产队的生产经营管理权特别重要。目前我国的农业生产主要是依靠手工劳动；各地的自然环境、作物特性和技术条件千差万别，不可能像工业生产那样在很大的范围内由上而下地制定统一的具体生产计划和技术措施，按照一律的要求进行生产。为了充分发挥人们在生产上的主动性和积极性，充分利用天时地利，必须使生产上的经营管理权力主要归生产队。公社的生产计划，必须建立在生产队的生产计划和生产小队的包产计划的基础上。作物安排、产量指标和技术措施，应该经过社员群众讨论，由生产队和生产小队共同商量制定，由社员当家作主。公社当然有权根据国家计划向生产队提出建议，并对各个生产队提出的计划做必要的和合理的平衡、调整，但是决不能不问实际情况，不听生产队、小队和社员群众的意见，主观地、硬性地安排作物面积、任意提高产量指标、硬性规定技术措施，更不允许随便抽调生产队的劳动力和生产资料。在特殊情况下，公社或其它生产队需要使用某个生产队的劳动力和生产资料的时候，也必须在不妨碍那个生产队本身需要的条件下，在自愿互利的原则下实行等价交换的协作，并且要按照规定由上级机关批准。
    有怎么样的所有制就要有怎么样的产品分配制度。现阶段人民公社里的主要生产资料基本上归生产队所有，产品也必须基本上由生产队分配。如果不使分配制度同生产队基本所有制相适应，维护和加强生产队基本所有制就会落空。生产小队收获的农产品和其它经营的收入，凡在包产任务以内的，都必须如实上交给生产队统一分配；超产部分也应该按照规定比例上交一部分，由生产队统一分配。生产队的全部收入（包括队一级经营的和各小队上交的收入），除了按照规定交纳国家税收和向公社交纳一定数量的公积金以外，其余的都在各个生产队内部分配，由各个生产队各计盈亏。生产队应当按照公社的规定抽出一定比例（例如5％左右）的公积金、公益金，扣除生产费用、流动资金和其它必要的开支以后，其余的都按照包产包工包成本和超产奖励的办法分给生产小队。在保证完成国家统一的收购计划和按照规定留足自用部分之后，粮食的多余部分，生产队可以多卖或自行储备，留下的自用部分由生产队统一管理；工业原料作物和副食品在完成国家统购计划和按照规定留下自用部分之后还有多余的，应当多卖，用现金在队内进行分配。
    维护和加强生产队的所有权、管理权和分配权，绝对不是意味着削弱人民公社的大集体力量，而恰恰是加强了人民公社大集体的物质基础。社营经济是整个人民公社经济的领导成分，代表着人民公社的伟大希望和伟大前途，是应该继续发展的。但是，这一部分经济主要应当依靠它本身的力量并在国家帮助下发展起来，而不能依靠从生产队提取过多的积累，或者从生产队抽调过多的劳动力和生产资料，用削弱队有经济的办法来发展。社营经济的发展，要以是否有利于农业生产为前提，要为农业生产服务。人民公社社营经济的发展，必须建立在各个生产队经济大发展的基础上。生产队是人民公社的基础，基础越强大，社营经济的发展越有前途和希望。
    维护和加强生产队基本所有制，也是生产小队的根本利益所在。社员的收入的主要部分（目前一般是80％左右）是来自全生产队的集体经济；完成包产任务并且力争超产，是各个生产小队和全体社员的首要任务。生产小队应该有小部分所有制。这就是：在完成包产任务的前提下，小队有权经营本队范围内的各项生产，特别是经营食堂的家底生产，有权自行支配超产奖励部分和节约开支部分。土地、耕畜、农具固定在小队，归小队使用，劳动力也固定在小队，生产队、公社都不应该随意变动；在一个生产年度尚未结束之前，决不能从小队抽调劳动力，抽走土地、耕畜、农具。这种小队小部分所有制和对生产资料固定使用的权力，不仅对于小队的生产有重大的意义，而且对整个农村经济的发展，特别是对农业经济的发展，也有重大的意义。
    社有经济、队有经济、小队经济是互相联系、互相促进的，必须共同发展；在现阶段，着重保证队有经济的发展是三级经济共同发展的中心环节。公社一级和生产小队一级应该从上下两方面来维护和加强生产队基本所有制，而不可从两头去削弱生产队基本所有制。
    既然在现阶段加强生产队基本所有制有这样重大的意义，就必须使我们的领导力量的配备同这个政策方针相适应。因此，在保证生产队应有的基本权利，充分发挥生产队的主动精神的同时，还要加强生产队的领导力量。各级下放干部绝大部分要放到生产队和生产小队；公社一级干部要用绝大部分时间和精力在生产队和生产小队里进行工作，特别是要加强对工作基础比较薄弱的生产队和生产小队的领导。
    两年多以来，人民公社在贯彻执行统一领导、分级管理、三级所有、队为基础这个根本制度方面，已经取得了丰富的经验。现在，把这些经验很好地加以总结和发扬，一定能够进一步加强人民公社的基础，进一步发挥人民公社的优越性，进一步调动公社各级和全体社员的积极性，进一步掀起大办农业、大办粮食的高潮，进一步加强整个国民经济的基础，从而为我国的社会主义建设事业的迅速发展创造更加有利的条件。
