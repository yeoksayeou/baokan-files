Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 21st: Two hundred and ten thousand temporary workers across Japan held mass rallies and demonstrations in six hundred locations today to oppose unemployment and poverty, demand the maintenance of their right to live, and demand the abolition of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

This is the first time in Japan that temporary workers have held such a massive joint struggle. They are demanding that the current unemployment benefits be increased from 340 yen per day to 600 yen per day, that relief subsidies be doubled, and that the government stop implementing the deceptive "National Pension" system. In Tokyo, 15,000 temporary workers from the capital and across the country held a mass rally in Hibiya Park. Most of the attendees were poorly dressed unemployed people, with an average age of forty to fifty years old. There were also many elderly workers in their sixties. The assembly unanimously adopted resolutions, appeals, and protest letters to be submitted to the Japanese government authorities. Finally, the assembly sent a protest delegation to the Ministry of Health and Welfare and the Ministry of Finance, presenting their demands to the government. The participants held a demonstration march on the main streets of downtown Tokyo.

    反对失业贫困　争取生活权利
    日本二十多万临时工示威
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：日本全国各地二十一万临时工今天在六百个地方举行群众大会和游行示威，反对失业和贫困，要求维护生活权利，要求废除新日美“安全条约”。
    日本临时工一齐举行规模如此浩大的联合斗争，这在日本还是第一次。他们要求：把现行的失业救济金从每天三百四十日元增加到每天六百日元，把救济津贴增加一倍，并反对政府实行骗人的“国民养老金”制度。在东京，来自首都和全国各地的一万五千名临时工在日比谷公园举行了群众大会。大多数与会者是衣衫褴褛的失业者，平均年龄是四十到五十岁。还有不少是六十多岁的老工人。大会一致通过了决议、呼吁书以及准备递交给日本政府当局的抗议信。大会最后派遣抗议代表团到厚生省和大藏省，向政府提出了他们的要求。与会者在东京闹市大街上举行了示威游行。
