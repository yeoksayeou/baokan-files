Red in the Countryside, Expert in the Countryside
Lantian Emerges a Large Number of Young Advanced Collectives and Individuals

(Reported by our newspaper) Shaanxi's Lantian County launched an education movement of "Red in the Countryside, Expert in the Countryside" among 55,000 rural youth and returned knowledge youth. Through education, the youth's production enthusiasm and communist awareness have been greatly improved, and the idea of taking part in agricultural production as an honor has been universally established.

As early as February this year, Lantian County convened a youth broadcast mobilization meeting of "Red in the Countryside, Expert in the Countryside," and launched an activity of planting a "Program" field and transforming a low-yield field for each person. After the Party Central Committee issued the call to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, the county further strengthened the ideological education of young people. From July to September, a communist education month movement of Red in the Countryside, Expert in the Countryside was carried out successively. During the movement month, Party organizations at all levels, in view of the youth's expertise, made use of agricultural work gaps and adopted forms such as Party class, exhibitions, and field reading of newspapers to publicize the great significance of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, the vigorous development of agriculture and grain production, and the glorious tasks of contemporary youth.

In order to educate young people to inherit the glorious traditions of revolutionary predecessors and carry forward the Yan'an style, the Youth League organizations at all levels invited old cadres who had worked in Yan'an to give reports to the young people, and organized the young people to read books describing the revolutionary struggle in the Yan'an era. Yang Renwa, a disabled soldier of the Jingjia Village Production Team of Tangyu Commune, had reclaimed wasteland in Nanniwan. Although he was physically disabled, he still carried manure with the commune members. The Youth League branch took advantage of the rest time to invite him to tell the young people about the situation of land reclamation and production in Nanniwan. The young people were deeply moved, and twenty-five people sent more than 25,000 catties of manure that day. After that, the young people also carried out activities of not occupying an inch of land for grain and cotton, not occupying a single working day, not asking for a single penny from the team, and increasing the planting of two fen of wheat field per person. Under their leadership, this activity was quickly promoted throughout the county. Within a few days, 8,913 mu of wheat were planted. Because this wheat field was purely wasteland, river滩地 [Tāndì: land near water], and edge land, and no labor remuneration was calculated, it was named "Yan'an Field."

In combination with propaganda, the county also commended the advanced youth collectives and individuals such as the Sanyi Production Team of Yushan Commune and the Yuchuan Street Production Team of Geyu Commune, praising their communist style of enjoying agriculture, taking pride in overcoming difficulties, and being selfless, and setting up pacesetters for the youth. The young commune members of the Sanyi Team had camped in the mountains and slept under the stone cliffs for three consecutive years, transforming nearly 70 mu of low-yield fields into high-yield fields. This autumn, they transformed another 100 mu and planted all of them with wheat. They transformed one batch, gave it to the production team, and then transformed another batch. In the past three years, they have also led all the commune members to reclaim more than 120 mountain tops of wasteland, increasing grain production by 300,000 catties, transforming from a grain-deficient team to a surplus grain team.

Once the pacesetter was established, the youth of the entire county immediately launched a movement to learn from, catch up with, help, and surpass the pacesetter. As of recently, 94 advanced collectives in the style of the Sanyi Youth Team and 1,485 advanced individuals in the style of Wang Shengtang have emerged throughout the county. He Fuxing, He Zhigong and other seven educated youths from the Fourth Team of the Hongxing Production Team of Yaoshan Commune were good students in school in the past. After studying the model deeds of Wang Shengtang, they have all become production shock workers. At present, the youth of this county are in high spirits, carrying grain and pots on their backs, going up the mountains and down to the beaches to reclaim wasteland, striving to produce more grain next year.

    红在农村  专在农村
    蓝田涌现大批青年先进集体和先进人物
    本报讯　陕西蓝田县在五万五千名农村青年和返乡知识青年中，展开了“红在农村、专在农村”的教育运动。通过教育，青年们的生产积极性和共产主义觉悟大大提高，普遍树立了以参加农业生产为荣的思想。
    早在今年2月，蓝田县就召开了“红在农村、专在农村”的青年广播誓师大会，并开展了每人种一块跨“纲要”田和改造一块低产田的活动。党中央发出大办农业、大办粮食的号召以后，这个县进一步加强了对青年的思想教育工作。7月到9月，先后开展了红在农村、专在农村的共产主义教育月运动。在运动月里，各级党的组织都针对青年的特长，利用农活空隙，采取了上团课、展览会、田间读报等形式，宣传了农业是国民经济基础，大办农业、大办粮食的重大意义，以及当代青年的光荣任务。
    为了教育青年继承革命先辈的光荣传统，发扬延安作风，各级团组织邀请了在延安工作过的老干部给青年作了报告，组织青年阅读有关描写延安时代革命斗争的书籍。汤峪公社敬家村生产队残废军人杨仁娃，曾经在南泥湾开过荒，他虽然身体残废仍然和社员一起背粪。团支部就借休息的时间，请他在地头给青年们讲述了南泥湾开荒生产的情况。青年们深受感动，二十五个人当天送粪二万五千多斤。此后，青年们还开展了不占粮棉一分地、不占一个劳动日、不要队内一分钱、每人增种二分麦田的活动。在他们的带动下，这个活动很快就在全县推广了起来。几天内就种了八千九百一十三亩小麦。由于这种麦田纯系荒地、河滩地、十边地等，又不计劳动报酬，因此被命名为“延安田”。
    结合宣传，这个县还表扬了玉山公社三谊生产队和葛玉公社玉川街生产队等青年先进集体和先进人物，表彰他们以农为乐、以战胜困难为荣和大公无私的共产主义风格，为青年们树立了标兵。三谊队的青年社员连续三年，在大山上扎营、石崖下睡觉，把将近七十亩低产田改造成高产田，今年秋季又改造了一百亩，全部种上了小麦。他们改造好一批，就让给生产队，然后再改造一批。三年来，他们还带动全体社员，开垦荒地一百二十多个山头，增产粮食三十万斤，由缺粮队一跃而为余粮队。
    标兵一经树起，全县的青年立即掀起了一个学、赶、帮、超标兵的运动。截至最近，全县已涌现三谊青年队式的先进集体九十四个，王升堂式的先进人物一千四百八十五名。嶢山公社红星生产队四小队何复兴、何志恭等七名知识青年，过去在学校是三好学生，经过学习了王升堂的模范事迹后，都成了生产突击手。目前，这个县的青年斗志昂扬，纷纷背粮带锅，上山下滩开荒，力争明年多打粮食。
