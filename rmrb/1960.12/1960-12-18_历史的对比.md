Historical facts are indeed the best textbook for life. To deeply understand current things and to correctly determine one's attitude towards life, one of the most important methods is to compare the past history with the new history of the present era that we are creating. Those who are good at understanding the present era from the past history can advance steadily with full confidence in any difficult situation and open up the road to a bright and splendid future.

Our Chinese " Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches" calendar cycles every sixty years. This year is the "Gengzi" year. What was the previous "Gengzi" year (1900) sixty years ago like? People can easily recall the "Gengzi Indemnity." That was the era when China, under feudal rule, was increasingly humiliated by imperialism. What was the people's life like at that time? "Beggars were in every village, corpses were everywhere on the roads. After winter, the tree bark was stripped bare, the grass roots were eaten clean, robbery was rampant, and thieves were everywhere, making small roads impassable, villages without smoke, fathers and sons not caring for each other, and husbands and wives separated; children were left unattended, crawling on the streets, crying and dying..." This is just a record from the county annals of Lin County in Shanxi. Of course, it was by no means only Lin County that was like this, nor was it only in 1900; flipping through the old county annals of any county, one could find such alarming records.

There are such bored imperialist elements who actually use fortune-telling by blind people to comfort their own hearts, which are disturbed by the Great Leap Forward of the new China, saying that the "Gengzi" of one hundred and twenty years ago and the "Gengzi" of sixty years ago were both unlucky years for China, and this year is again "Gengzi," so the Chinese should be unlucky again. They either simply do not understand what changes in the times are all about, or they deliberately close their eyes and do not want to see, dare not see, what has happened on the eastern land of the earth in more than a hundred years, in several decades, especially in recent years.

This year, we have indeed encountered a major disaster rarely seen in history, and the extent of the disaster is much more serious than in 1900. Taking Lin County as an example, in 1900 there were droughts in spring and summer, and sufficient rain in autumn, so the late autumn crops grew very well; this year it has not rained since last autumn, and it has not rained heavily throughout the year. During the spring sowing season, there was no rain for a hundred days, and later occasional rains were sporadic. In 1900, it was only a severe drought; this year, disasters such as drought, wind, frost, insects, and hail occurred together. As a result? Although Lin County's grain production this year was reduced by about 100 million jin compared to last year, it still harvested nearly twice as much as in 1900. The people of the whole county not only lived and worked in peace and contentment during the spring, summer, and autumn seasons as usual, but also enthusiastically engaged in production for disaster relief after winter, striving for a bumper harvest next year. The young people of Lin County, who grew up in the liberated areas, find it hard to imagine what it was like when they heard the old people in their seventies and eighties talk about the events of the Guangxu years. With the strong leadership of the Party, the strong power of the people's communes, the courage and wisdom to overcome difficulties, and the support from all sides, what kind of miracle have the people of Lin County created! With such people, what difficulties can stop us from advancing on the road to communism? Who can say that by the next "Gengzi" year, we cannot build a paradise on earth here?

Thinking about the past and looking to the future, we can understand what kind of temporary difficulties the natural disasters have caused us, and we can also understand how we should deal with such difficulties. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Many young people, due to lack of political experience and social life experience, are not good at comparing the old China with the new China, and it is not easy to deeply understand how the Chinese people have gone through hardships and struggles to get rid of the oppression of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and what kind of long-term hard work is needed to establish a beautiful socialist society. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct lively and practical political education among the masses, and it is necessary to always make a true explanation of the difficulties that have occurred to them, and to study with them how to solve the difficulties."
(《On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People》) Historical comparison is a most vivid and practical political education. We must be good at using historical materials and the memories of the elderly, and give full play to the strengths of those people among the masses who are "good at comparing the old China with the new China"; this can not only educate people to correctly understand the difficulties, but also strengthen people's confidence in conquering difficulties and find many ways to conquer difficulties.

    历史的对比
    杨弃
    历史的事实，的确是生活的最好的教科书。人们要深刻地认识现在的事物，要正确地决定生活的态度，有一个最重要的方法，就是把过去的历史和我们正在创造的现时代的新历史加以对比。善于从过去的历史认识现在的时代的人，在任何艰苦困难的情况下也能够满怀信心地脚踏实地地前进，开辟通向光辉灿烂的未来的道路。
    我国纪年的“天干地支”六十年轮一圈。今年是“庚子”年。六十年前的上一个“庚子”年（1900年）如何？人们很容易想起来“庚子赔款”。那是中国在封建统治下日益屈辱于帝国主义的年代。那时候人民生活如何？“村村乞丐沿门，道路死尸遍地。入冬后，树皮剥尽，草根吃光，刁抢流行，盗贼四起，弄得小道无人行，村落断烟火，父子不相顾，夫妻各东西；孩子无人收留，爬行于街头号哭而死。……”这不过是山西的一个县份——临县的县志上的记载。当然，决不是只有临县一地如此，也不是只有1900年是如此；翻翻随便哪个县份的旧县志，都少不了这样一些现在看来令人心惊肉跳的记载。
    有这样百无聊赖的帝国主义分子，竟然用瞎子算命的方法来宽慰他们自己因新中国的大跃进而惶惑不安的心，说一百二十年前的“庚子”和六十年前的“庚子”都是中国倒霉的年份，今年又是“庚子”，又该中国人倒霉了。他们或者是根本不懂得时代的变迁是怎么一回事，或者是故意闭上眼睛不愿看、不敢看一百多年间、几十年间，特别是近几年间，在地球东部的大地上发生了什么样的事情。
    今年，我们的确碰上了历史少有的大灾，而且受灾的程度要比1900年严重得多。以临县来说，1900年是春夏两旱、秋来雨足，晚秋作物长得还很好；今年是从去年秋后就不下雨，全年没下一次透雨，春播期间百日滴雨未降，以后偶而落雨也是星星点点。1900年只是旱灾较重；今年是旱、风、冻、虫、雹等灾害交错发生。结果呢？今年临县的粮食虽然比去年减产约一亿斤，可是比1900年仍然多收将近两倍。全县人民不但春、夏、秋三季同常年一样安居乐业，入冬后依然满怀信心地大搞生产救灾，争取明年丰收。从小就在解放区生长起来的临县的年轻人，听七八十岁的老人们讲光绪年间事情，简直很难想像那是怎么一回事。有党的坚强领导，有人民公社的强大力量，有战胜困难的勇气和智谋，又有各方面的支援，临县人民创造了怎样的奇迹！有这样的人民，还有什么困难能挡住我们在通向共产主义的大道上前进？谁能说，到下一个“庚子”年，在我们这里不能建成地上的天堂？
    想想过去，望望将来，就可以认识，现在天灾给我们造成的暂时的困难究竟是什么样的困难，也就可以了解，我们应该怎样对待这样的困难。毛泽东同志说：“不少青年人由于缺少政治经验和社会生活经验，不善于把旧中国和新中国加以比较，不容易深切了解我国人民曾经怎样经历千辛万苦的斗争才摆脱了帝国主义和国民党反动派的压迫，而建立一个美好的社会主义社会要经过怎样的长时间的艰苦劳动。因此，需要在群众中间经常进行生动的、切实的政治教育，并且应当经常把发生的困难向他们作真实的说明，和他们一起研究如何解决困难的办法。”
    （《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》）历史的对比，正是一种最生动、最切实的政治教育。我们一定要善于运用历史材料和老年人的回忆，充分发挥群众中间那些“善于把旧中国和新中国加以比较”的人们的长处；这不但能够教育人们正确地认识困难，而且能够加强人们征服困难的信心，找到许多征服困难的方法。
