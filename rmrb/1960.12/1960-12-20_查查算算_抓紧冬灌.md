    Check, Calculate, Seize Winter Irrigation
    "A timely snow promises a good harvest." Recently, some areas in the north have had snow, which is a good thing. After it snows, is winter irrigation still necessary? This is a question that needs serious study at present, and it is a very urgent one.
    In doing anything, we must have a clear understanding of the situation and make our subjective intentions conform to objective reality. Winter irrigation is no exception. It is not necessarily truly in line with the actual situation to see the snow and the white expanse and assume that winter irrigation is no longer needed. The amount of snow varies, the base moisture of the land varies; the terrain is different, and the thickness of the snow cover will also be different. It is not right to say that winter irrigation is no longer needed across the board; it is also not right to say that winter irrigation is needed across the board; it is also not right to irrigate the same amount of water across the board. Some communes conduct "one check and four calculations" when arranging winter irrigation work, namely: mobilizing the masses to conduct a general survey of soil moisture content, calculating tasks, calculating time, calculating water sources, and calculating labor. This is very necessary.
    According to the results of soil moisture checks in some areas, although it has snowed in some places, the rain and snow were small, and coupled with long-term drought and poor base moisture, the soil moisture content is still insufficient. After this snowfall in Hebei Province, more than 60% of the wheat fields still need irrigation. According to a survey of 48 counties in Henan Province, the soil moisture content is 15% to 20% in 55% of the cultivated land area, and below 15% in 18%; therefore, most of the land still needs winter irrigation. (Note: The suitable soil moisture content for winter wheat growth is generally 18% to 23%) It is necessary for all localities to conduct such an inspection. In addition to understanding the overall situation, it is also necessary to understand the specific situation of each plot, adapt to local conditions, and treat them differently. Winter crops with the worst soil moisture should be irrigated first and more; winter crops with generally poor soil moisture can be irrigated later and less, and land with very good soil moisture can not be irrigated; in some places, wheat fields have too much water and need to be drained. Winter fallow land, especially land preparing to grow cotton, should be irrigated with winter water as much as possible if water sources, labor, and power are sufficient, which is of great benefit to alleviating the tension of water and labor during the spring plowing period next year and ensuring timely sowing. If water sources are scarce, attention should also be paid to appropriately concentrating their use, and forces should not be dispersed.
    Special attention should also be paid to grasping the timing. The "Winter Solstice" is coming soon, and the time suitable for winter irrigation is getting shorter and shorter. In the main wheat and cotton producing areas of Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, and Shaanxi provinces, there is generally only about a month left, and every day and every hour is very precious. All measures should be taken to extend the winter irrigation time. When the temperature is low, wheat fields can be irrigated during the day and fallow land can be irrigated at night; people can also be divided into several shifts to irrigate in rotation, so that people can rest and work in combination, and irrigation efficiency can be improved. At the same time, we must pay attention at all times to prevent the channels from being blocked by ice and breaking during very cold weather, or from the water not being able to seep in after watering due to freezing, which can damage the wheat seedlings.
    Time, tasks, soil moisture, water sources, land, labor, power, and tools are all "numbers"; irrigating more, irrigating less, irrigating first, and irrigating later are also "numbers." In order to do a good job in winter irrigation, we must have a clear understanding of the situation. We must not only make every "number" accurate, but also clarify the relationship between each "number." The cadres and commune members of each production unit have the most accurate and clearest understanding of these "numbers" for each production unit and each piece of land. Whether to irrigate? How much to irrigate? How to irrigate? This should be decided by the production team, production group, and the vast number of commune members. In order to do this work better, please, cadres of the county and commune, quickly go to each production team and production group to study with the team cadres and commune members!

### 查查算算  抓紧冬灌

    查查算算  抓紧冬灌
    “瑞雪兆丰年”。近来北方一些地区下了雪，这是好事情。下了雪，还要不要实行冬灌了呢？这是一个当前需要认真研究的问题，而且是一个很迫切的问题。
    办什么事情都要胸中有数，都要使主观意图符合客观情况，冬灌这件事情也不例外。看到下了雪，白茫茫一片，就一股笼统地认为不再需要冬灌了，这不一定真正符合实际情况。雪的大小不同，地的底墒不同；地势不一样，积雪的厚薄也会不一样。一律不要再行冬灌，是不对的；一律都要再行冬灌，也是不对的；一律灌同样多的水，那也不对。有些公社在安排冬灌工作的时候先进行“一查四算”，就是：发动群众普查土壤含水率，算任务，算时间，算水源，算劳力。这样做是很必要的。
    据一些地区查看墒情的结果，有的地方虽然下了雪，但是雨雪较小，加以长期干旱、底墒不好，土壤含水率仍然不足。河北省这次下雪以后，仍有60％以上的麦田需要灌水。据河南省四十八个县的调查，土壤含水率在15％到20％的占耕地面积的55％，在15％以下的占18％；因之大部分土地仍然需要进行冬灌。（按：适宜冬小麦生长的土壤含水率一般是18％到23％）各地都有必要作一次这样的检查。除了了解全面的概况之外，还要了解每一地段的具体情况，因地制宜，分别对待。墒情最不好的越冬作物要先浇多浇；墒情一般较差的越冬作物可后浇少浇，墒情很好的地也可以不浇；有的地方麦田水分过多，还要排涝。冬闲地，特别是准备种棉花的地，在水源、劳力、动力够用的情况下，要尽可能浇一次冬水，这对缓和明年春耕期间用水和劳力的紧张程度和保证及时播种大有好处。如果水源较少，也要注意适当地集中使用，不可分散力量。
    还要特别注意掌握时机。“冬至”很快就要到来，适宜冬灌的时间越来越短了，在河南、河北、山东、山西、陕西等省主要麦、棉产区，一般只有一个月左右，每一天、每一小时的时间都是十分宝贵的。要采取一切措施延长冬灌时间，在气温较低的时候可以白天浇麦地、晚间浇白地；也可以把人分成几班轮流灌溉，人停水不停，既做到劳逸结合，又提高灌溉效率。同时要随时留意，防止在太冷的时候渠道拥冰决口，或者浇水后因结冰而不能下渗，损伤麦苗。
    时间，任务，墒情，水源，土地，劳力，动力，工具，这些都是“数”；多灌，少灌，先灌，后灌，这些也都是“数”。为了抓好冬灌，我们必须作到胸中有数，不但要把每个“数”都弄准确，还要把各个“数”之间的关系弄清楚。对于每一个生产单位和每一片土地的这些“数”了解得最准确、最清楚的，还是各个生产单位的干部和社员群众。灌不灌？灌多少？怎样灌？这要由各个生产队生产小队和广大社员一起去决定。为了把这件工作作得更好，请县和公社的干部赶快到各个生产队和生产小队里去，同队干部和社员们一起研究研究吧！
