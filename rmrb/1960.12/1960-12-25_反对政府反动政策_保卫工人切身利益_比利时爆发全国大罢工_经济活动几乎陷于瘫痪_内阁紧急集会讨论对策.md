Xinhua News Agency, December 24th, Brussels dispatch: The Belgian workers' strike struggle against the government's reactionary economic policies is continuing to develop with great momentum. The latest wave of strikes, which began recently, entered its fifth day today.

The strike has brought almost all activities across the country to a standstill. Trains and buses have stopped running, inland water transport has been disrupted, and gas and electricity supplies have been cut off. In cities such as Antwerp and Liège, strikers clashed with police sent by the authorities to suppress the strike.

This nationwide strike by Belgian workers against the government's economic policies is of immense scale, with workers of various political persuasions participating. The strike has also paralyzed rail traffic passing through southern and eastern Belgium to West Germany, Austria, Italy, and Switzerland. In the port of Antwerp, hundreds of ships are unable to leave, and the streets of Brussels are filled with garbage.

The Belgian Cabinet held an emergency meeting this morning to discuss measures to deal with the situation. The communiqué issued after the meeting created excuses for further suppressing the strike movement. The communiqué described the workers' just struggle as "violence, sabotage, and go-slow activities" and stated that a decision had been made to strengthen all "security measures." It is reported that large numbers of police have been dispatched throughout the country. This strike is in opposition to the so-called "economic austerity plan" proposed by the Eyskens government, the purpose of which is to shift the losses suffered by Belgian monopoly capitalist groups in the Congo onto the working people. According to this plan, Belgium will increase new taxes by 9 billion francs next year and cut public construction and health expenditures by more than 25 billion francs. Since the announcement of this plan, Belgian workers have continued to express strong opposition. The Belgian Communist Party and some trade union organizations have called on workers to strike when the parliament debates the government's bill in December, demanding the withdrawal of the plan.

    反对政府反动政策　保卫工人切身利益
    比利时爆发全国大罢工
    经济活动几乎陷于瘫痪　内阁紧急集会讨论对策
    据新华社24日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：比利时工人反对政府反动经济政策的罢工斗争正在声势澎湃地继续发展。最近开始的这一新的罢工浪潮今天已进入第五天。
    罢工已使全国几乎所有活动都陷于瘫痪，火车和公共汽车停驶，内河航运中断，煤气和电力也停止了供应。在安特卫普和列日等城市，罢工者同当局派来镇压罢工的警察发生冲突。
    这次比利时工人反对政府经济政策的全国性罢工有着巨大的规模，各种政治倾向的工人都参加了。罢工还使得经过比利时的南部和东部到西德、奥地利、意大利和瑞士去的铁路交通陷于瘫痪，在安特卫普港，有成百艘轮船开不出去，布鲁塞尔大街上都堆满垃圾。
    比利时内阁今晨召开紧急会议讨论对付局势的措施。会后发表的公报为进一步镇压罢工运动制造借口，公报把工人的正义斗争说成是“暴力、破坏和怠工活动”，并且说已经决定加强一切“安全措施”。据报道，大批警察已经派赴全国各地。这次罢工是反对伊斯更斯政府提出的所谓“经济节约计划”，政府这个计划的目的是要把比利时垄断资本集团丧失刚果的损失转嫁到劳动人民头上。按照这个计划，比利时明年度要增收九十亿法郎新税，并且削减公共建设和卫生经费二百五十多亿法郎。这个计划公布后，比利时工人就一直继续不断地表示激烈反对，比利时共产党和一些工会组织号召工人在12月议会辩论政府这个法案时举行罢工，要求撤销这个计划。
