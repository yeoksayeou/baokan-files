Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 27th: Algerian Republic Provisional Government Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ben Bella said here today that the Algerian people and army are not only fighting against the French army, they are also fighting against all NATO countries, "because Western imperialist countries, especially the United States, are actively participating in the Algerian war." He said, "The task of the Algerian National Liberation Army is to carry out the struggle to a successful conclusion, in other words, until Algeria obtains its complete independence."

When talking about De Gaulle's conspiracy to hold a "referendum" in Algeria in early January next year, Ben Bella emphasized that the Algerian government will not recognize this "referendum" "because it is being carried out under the threat of NATO weapons held by the French army."

Regarding the final resolution of the Algerian issue, he said that this issue can be resolved in two mutually exclusive ways: either continue armed hostilities, for which the Algerian National Liberation Army is fully prepared to carry out; or the French government and the Algerian Republic Provisional Government hold negotiations on an equal footing.

Ben Bella finally called on Asian and African countries to further support the Algerian people's heroic struggle for national independence.

Xinhua News Agency, December 28th: According to TASS, Paris, December 27th: De Gaulle's fraud of planning to hold a "referendum" on the Algerian issue on January 8th next year is encountering increasingly strong opposition.

The local organizations of the French Communist Party, the Unified Socialist Party, the General Confederation of Labor, the French Women's Union, the French Communist Youth League, and some other mass organizations in the Nord region jointly issued an appeal to the residents of this province, demanding that they firmly oppose De Gaulle's fraud and vote against it in the "referendum."

The Communist Party and the Unified Socialist Party organizations in the Marais region and Fécamp city in the Lower Seine province also issued similar appeals. The appeal to the residents of Marais pointed out that answering "no" to the "referendum" would mean answering "no" to continuing the colonial war in Algeria.

In Pont-de-Beauvoisin, Isère, organizations such as the Communist Party, the Unified Socialist Party, the General Confederation of Labor, the National Teachers' Union, the Education Workers' Federation, and the French Women's Union unanimously decided to oppose the government's fraud on the Algerian issue.

    阿尔及利亚人民将战斗到完全独立
    戴高乐“公民投票”骗局遭到法国人民强烈反对
    新华社开罗27日电　阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府副总理兼外交部长贝勒卡塞姆今天在这里说，阿尔及利亚人民和军队不仅在对法国军队作战，他们还在对所有北大西洋公约组织国家作战，“因为西方帝国主义国家，特别是美国，正在积极参预阿尔及利亚的战事”。他说，“阿尔及利亚民族解放军的任务是把斗争进行到成功的结果，换句话说，直到阿尔及利亚获得它完全的独立。”
    贝勒卡塞姆在谈到戴高乐策划明年1月上旬在阿尔及利亚举行“公民投票”的阴谋时强调说，阿尔及利亚政府将不承认这种“公民投票”，“因为这是在掌握在法国军队手中的北大西洋公约组织的武器的威胁下进行的。”
    关于阿尔及利亚问题的最后解决，他说，这个问题可以用两种非此即彼的办法来解决：要末继续进行武装敌对行动，而阿尔及利亚民族解放军对于进行这种敌对行动是完全有准备的；要末法国政府和阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府在平等的基础上进行谈判。
    贝勒卡塞姆最后呼吁亚非国家进一步支持阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的英勇斗争。
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社巴黎27日讯：戴高乐策划在明年1月8日就阿尔及利亚问题举行“公民投票”的骗局正在遭到越来越强烈的反对。
    法国共产党、统一社会党、总工会、法兰西妇女联盟、法兰西共产主义青年联盟以及其他一些群众团体在诺尔省的地方组织联合向这个省的居民发出呼吁，要求他们坚决反对戴高乐的骗局，并且在“公民投票”时投反对票。
    共产党和统一社会党在沼原省和下塞纳省费康市的组织也发出了同样的呼吁书，在对沼原居民发出的呼吁书中指出，对“公民投票”回答“不”，将意味着对在阿尔及利亚继续进行殖民战争回答“不”。
    在伊塞尔省蓬德—博乌阿泽市，共产党、统一社会党、总工会、全国教师工会、教育工作者联合会和法兰西妇女联盟等组织一致决定反对政府在阿尔及利亚问题上的骗局。
