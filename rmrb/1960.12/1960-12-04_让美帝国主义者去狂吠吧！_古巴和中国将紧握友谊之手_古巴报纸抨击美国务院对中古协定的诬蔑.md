Xinhua News Agency, Havana, December 2nd. Cuban newspapers today vehemently criticized the statement issued by the U.S. State Department on December 1st, which slandered the economic cooperation agreement and trade protocol signed between China and Cuba.

	*Calle* newspaper's commentary said, "The fact that the agreement (with China) makes them so unhappy is enough to make it clear that this agreement is very beneficial to us and our heroic Chinese friends. If this agreement were bad, the imperialists would warmly welcome it so that we would collapse as soon as possible." *Calle* pointed out that what U.S. imperialism welcomes is bad, and what it criticizes is good.

	The newspaper emphasized, "China will provide us with a $60 million interest-free loan. This is completely incomprehensible to the U.S. big stick advocates. Because if they provide a loan of ten yuan, it is to get two hundred yuan in return, in addition to imposing heavy political enslavement conditions of humiliation. The Chinese loan has no such conditions, so U.S. imperialism has engaged in slander." *Calle* also said, "According to the U.S. imperialists, China has nothing good to offer Cuba in terms of industrial production. Let them continue to sleep on. When they wake up, they will see excellent industrial equipment made in China for us here." The newspaper believes that the U.S. State Department's claim that China's aid is purely an "attempt to consolidate its foothold in the Western Hemisphere" is nothing more than the old tune of imperialism. It said that trade agreements and treaties signed with socialist countries not only do not harm the interests of any Latin American country, but on the contrary, they point out a good way to solve many problems of this backward and underdeveloped continent. At the same time, the signing of these trade agreements and treaties makes it impossible for imperialism to strangle us.

	*Revolución* newspaper pointed out in a commentary that the United States' slander of China's economic assistance to Cuba as China's communist attempt to invade Latin America, etc., is completely its old tune. The newspaper said, "This act of Sino-Cuban friendship has shocked the Western world." The newspaper emphasized that People's China has extended a hand of friendship to us.

	*El Mundo* newspaper pointed out in an editorial today that the economic cooperation agreement signed with China has opened up a new market for Cuba. There, Cuba can sell its products and obtain other products, thereby breaking through the encirclement that attempts to isolate Cuba. At the same time, it has expanded the scope of trade that was previously restricted due to dependence on the United States. The newspaper pointed out that the economic cooperation agreement signed between Cuba and China shows that no matter what some people have done and are doing to strangle Cuba, Cuba has many friends in the world who are ready to help her; on the other hand, it also shows that Cuba can obtain sufficient economic resources to ensure her victory. The newspaper said, "We are not isolated. The people of other countries are united with us through the material ties of economic relations, especially through their friendship, sympathy, and spirit of cooperation. Their assistance, their example, and their sympathy encourage us, give us strength, and enable us to move forward with firm steps along the established path that is open to us."

	*El Mundo* said in another article on the same day that the People's Republic of China's decision to purchase one million tons of Cuban sugar next year is a positive support for consolidating Cuba's sugar industry, guaranteeing that Cuba's 1961 sugar production will be at least the same as that of 1959.

    让美帝国主义者去狂吠吧！
    古巴和中国将紧握友谊之手
    古巴报纸抨击美国务院对中古协定的诬蔑
    新华社哈瓦那2日电　古巴报纸今天猛烈抨击美国国务院1日发表的诬蔑中国同古巴签订的经济合作协定和贸易议定书的谈话。
    《街道报》的评论说，“（和中国签订经济）协定使他们这样地不高兴，这个事实就足以使人明白这个协定对我们和我们英雄的中国朋友们是很有利的。假若这个协定不好的话，帝国主义者便会热烈地表示欢迎，以便使我们尽快地垮台。”《街道报》指出，美帝国主义表示欢迎的，那就是坏的，如果它抨击，那就是好的。
    报纸强调说，“中国将向我们提供六千万美元的无息贷款。这是美国大棒主义者所完全不能理解的。因为如果他们提供拾元的贷款，那是为了得到二百元，此外还施加沉重的屈辱的政治奴役条件。而中国的贷款没有任何这样的条件，因此美帝国主义进行了造谣中伤。”《街道报》还说，“据美帝国主义者说，中国在工业生产方面没有什么好东西可以供给古巴。让他们在一旁继续睡觉去吧。当他们醒来的时候，他们将会在这里看到中国为我们制造的优良的工业设备。”这家报纸认为，美国国务院说什么中国的援助纯粹是“企图巩固它在西半球的立足点”这类话完全是帝国主义的老调。它说，同社会主义国家签订的贸易协定和条约不但没有损害任何拉丁美洲国家的利益，恰恰相反，它们指出了解决这个落后和不发达大陆的许多问题的良好道路。同时由于签订这些贸易协定和条约，使得帝国主义无法扼杀我们。
    《解放报》在评论中指出，美国诬蔑中国对古巴的经济援助是中国共产主义企图侵入拉丁美洲等等，完全是它的老调。这家报纸说，“中古友谊的这一行动震惊了西方世界。”报纸强调指出，人民中国向我们伸出了友谊的手。
    《世界报》今天在社论里指出，同中国签订的经济合作协定为古巴开辟了一个新的市场。在那里，古巴能够出售她的产品和获得其它的产品，从而突破企图使古巴陷于孤立的包围。同时也扩大了过去由于对美国的依赖而受到限制的贸易范围。报纸指出，古巴同中国签订的经济合作协定表明，不管有人为了扼杀古巴已经做了什么和正在做些什么，但是古巴在世界上有许多准备援助她的朋友；另一方面也表明，古巴能够得到足以保证她胜利的经济资源。这家报纸说，“我们不是孤立的。其它国家的人民通过经济关系的物质联系，特别是通过他们的友谊、同情和合作的精神联系与我们团结在一起。他们的援助、他们的榜样以及他们的同情都鼓舞着我们，使我们获得力量，以坚定的步伐向在我们面前打开的既定的道路前进。”
    《世界报》在同一天的另一篇文章里说，中华人民共和国决定明年购买古巴的一百万吨食糖是对巩固古巴的蔗糖工业的一个积极的支持，它保证了古巴1961年的食糖产量至少能同1959年的产量相同。
