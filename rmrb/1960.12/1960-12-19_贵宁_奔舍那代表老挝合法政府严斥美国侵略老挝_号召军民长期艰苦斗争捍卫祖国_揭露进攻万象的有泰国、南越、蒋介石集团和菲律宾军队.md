Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 18th. The Lao legitimate government radio station broadcasted on the evening of the 17th that Propaganda Minister Quinim Pholsena, after inspecting the Vientiane battlefield, delivered a speech on behalf of the Phouma legitimate government, solemnly condemning US imperialism and its running dogs, the Thai reactionaries, for interfering in and invading Laos, and calling on the Lao army and people to fight side by side to defend the motherland.

Quinim Pholsena said: "On the afternoon of December 15th and the morning of the 16th, I visited the troops and people who are fighting to defend the capital, Vientiane, and saw the situation of the fighting. All the facts prove that the offensive against Vientiane was carried out by traitorous troops commanded by US officers, and by troops from Thailand, Ngo Dinh Diem, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and the Philippines. They used US-made tanks, armored vehicles, gunboats, aircraft, artillery, and 120mm mortars to attack government troops and the people. They used the US, Thai, and South Vietnamese embassies in Vientiane, as well as the offices of the US News Agency and aid agencies in Vientiane, as rebel strongholds, and US embassy personnel also cooperated with the rebels in shooting. More than 300 shells were fired at Vientiane city from 105mm cannons located in Chiang Mai County, Thailand, killing and wounding more than 100 Lao civilians."

Quinim Pholsena said: "I personally witnessed the heroic fighting spirit of the government troops, including the 2nd Parachute Battalion, the Vientiane Army Department, and the police, the Pathet Lao Fighting Units, and the youth armed forces. Although the strength of the traitorous clique and foreign reactionary forces is several times greater than ours, thanks to the high patriotism and heroic fighting spirit of our troops and youth, they fought bravely for three days and nights and controlled Vientiane City. My confidence has been strengthened by the wholehearted support of all the people for the Souvanna Phouma government and the government army."

Quinim Pholsena continued: "At present, US imperialism, the Thai reactionaries, and the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique are transferring troops from Thailand to increase their strength. Our army and people's struggle to defend the motherland and the path of peace and neutrality will encounter great difficulties. In this serious situation, I, on behalf of the Phouma legitimate government, solemnly announce: We severely condemn and resolutely oppose US imperialism and the Thai reactionaries for interfering in and invading Laos, seriously violating Lao sovereignty, and severely condemn and resolutely oppose the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique for attacking Vientiane and acting as US imperialism's running dogs in creating a bloody conspiracy in the capital."

Quinim Pholsena emphasized: "US imperialism, the Thai reactionaries, and their running dogs, the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique, must bear full responsibility for the consequences of their offensive against Vientiane."

Quinim Pholsena then said: "I would like to welcome and commend the Kingdom's army, the Pathet Lao Fighting Units, and the youth and people of Vientiane for their high patriotism and heroic fighting spirit. I call on the army and people to fight side by side to resolutely oppose the US aggressors, the Thai reactionaries, and their running dogs, in order to defend our beloved motherland. Our people's just struggle against US and Thai aggression and against the Lao traitorous clique is a long-term and arduous struggle, but final victory will surely belong to us."

Quinim Pholsena finally called on "the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference, the signatory countries of the Geneva Agreement, the Asian and African countries, and the peace-loving governments and people of the world, to jointly condemn and oppose the US imperialism and the Thai reactionaries' aggression against Laos, and support the just struggle of the Lao people."

    新华社河内18日电　据老挝合法政府广播电台17日晚广播：宣传大臣贵宁·奔舍那在视察万象战场后代表富马合法政府发表谈话，严正谴责美帝国主义及其走狗泰国反动派等干涉和侵略老挝，并且号召老挝军民并肩一道，为捍卫祖国而坚决斗争。
    贵宁·奔舍那说：“12月15日下午和16日上午，我访问了为保卫首都万象而正在战斗的部队和人民，看到了战斗的情况。一切情况证明，这次进攻万象的有美国军官指挥的叛国军队，有泰国、吴庭艳、蒋介石集团和菲律宾的军队。他们用美制坦克、装甲车、炮艇、飞机、大炮、一二零毫米的迫击炮进攻政府军和人民。他们把美国、泰国、南越驻万象使馆和美国驻万象通讯社、援助机构的办公处作为叛军的堡垒，美国使馆人员也配合叛军射击。设在泰国西川迈县的口径一零五毫米的大炮向万象市发射了三百多发炮，使一百多名老挝百姓死伤。”
    贵宁·奔舍那说：“我亲眼看到了包括第二伞兵营、万象陆军部和警察的政府军，寮国战斗部队和青年武装力量英勇战斗的精神。尽管叛国集团和外国反动势力的力量比我方大几倍，但由于我方部队和青年高度的爱国主义和英勇战斗的精神，在三昼夜内进行了英勇的战斗，控制万象市。由于全体人民全心全意地支持梭发那·富马政府和政府军，而加强了我的信心。”
    贵宁·奔舍那接着说：“目前，美帝国主义—泰国反动派和富米—文翁叛国集团正从泰国调兵，以增强他们的力量。我国军民保卫祖国和和平中立路线的斗争将会遇到极大的困难。在这种严重的情况下，我谨代表富马合法政府宣布：严厉谴责和坚决反对美帝国主义和泰国反动派干涉和侵略老挝、严重地侵犯老挝主权，严厉谴责和坚决反对进攻万象、并在首都制造流血阴谋中充当美帝国主义走狗的富米—文翁叛国集团。”
    贵宁·奔舍那强调指出：“美帝国主义、泰国反动派以及走狗富米—文翁叛国集团必须对他们进攻万象所造成的后果担负全部责任。”
    贵宁·奔舍那接着说：“我谨欢迎和赞扬王国军队、寮国战斗部队和万象青年、人民高度的爱国主义精神和英勇的战斗精神。我谨呼吁军民并肩一起，坚决反对美国侵略者、泰国反动派及其走狗，以保卫我们可爱的祖国。我国人民反对美国、泰国的侵略和反对老挝叛国集团的正义斗争是长期、艰苦的斗争，但最后胜利一定属于我们。”
    贵宁·奔舍那最后呼吁“1954年日内瓦会议两位主席、日内瓦协议签字国、亚非各国和世界爱好和平的政府和人民，共同谴责和反对美帝国主义和泰国反动派对老挝的侵略，支持老挝人民的正义斗争。”
