(Reported by Tianjin Daily) Tianjin Steel Plant No. 3’s leading cadres went deep into the front lines of production. They first acted as students, then as teachers, understanding the weak link of the pig iron furnace production after the furnace itself. They strengthened political and ideological work in the material feeding process, quickly reversing the unstable situation of pig iron furnace production and ensuring the continuous increase in steel production.

In the previous stage, the factory, following the spirit of "taking steelmaking as the center and the pig iron furnace as the key," carried out technical transformation of the pig iron furnace and focused on the smelting process, solving key problems such as long start-up times for new furnaces. This greatly improved the production level of the pig iron furnace. Recently, the factory's steel production has leaped again, reaching unprecedented levels. Under these circumstances, the melting rate and desulfurization rate of the pig iron furnace often could not meet the needs of the converter, and the pig iron furnace became a weak link for the entire factory. In order to understand the situation and solve this problem, the Party Secretary and the Factory Director, in the spirit of "first being a student, then being a teacher," went to the pig iron furnace workshop to visit the workers. They held a “Zhuge Liang Meeting.”

They came to the pig iron furnace and first fully disclosed the current problem that the pig iron furnace could not meet the needs of the steelmaking furnace to the masses, mobilizing everyone to find problems and find reasons. The workers actively reported the situation to the leadership. The furnace workers said: The fluctuation of the melting rate and desulfurization efficiency of the pig iron furnace is mainly in the first three furnaces after the shift change. In the past, the first three furnaces would slowly return to normal. Why do the first three furnaces fluctuate? Xu Fushan, an old worker at the pig iron furnace, said: "The quality of the pig iron furnace is greatly related to the material feeding." Some also said: "Before the shift change, we rush to produce molten iron, and after the shift change, we rush to add iron and carbon, which causes the lack of continuity in the first three furnaces after the shift change." The information the workers provided was very enlightening to the leadership. They then held a forum for the feeding workers after the furnace. The speeches at the forum were very enthusiastic. Someone said: "We feeding workers are just moving big iron pieces, just filling the furnace is enough. The speed of iron melting is the business of the furnace technicians, we don't worry about that." Han Deyu, an old feeding worker, disagreed with this view. He said: "The materials are in our hands, we know which iron is good and which is bad. When handing over the shift, if the charge is two low and one high (low flux, low carbon, high iron), the pig iron furnace will not eat well. If the charge is two high and one low (high flux, high carbon, low iron), the pig iron furnace will not be full." Someone else chimed in, "The feeding list is fixed, but people are flexible. As long as we grasp the changes in the iron, and flexibly allocate the materials, there will be no big problem with the furnace." At the meeting, some people also took the initiative to examine their shortcomings; some also made suggestions to the leadership: "The leadership focuses on the pig iron furnace, but every time they grasp the pig iron furnace, they go to the front of the furnace, no one comes to the back of the furnace. The searchlights in our material yard have been broken for a long time, no one cares. We load materials in the dark every day, how can we talk about ‘fine materials’." The more everyone talked, the happier they were, and the clearer the problems became. Finally, the Party Secretary said: "Our steel mill is like a play, the protagonist is steelmaking, and we feeding workers are like the people backstage who manage makeup and stage management. Without us, the protagonist, no matter how skilled, cannot perform this play." After hearing this, the workers felt that their responsibility was great, and they all said: In the future, we must cooperate well with the furnace workers and carefully allocate materials to ensure that the pig iron furnace eats well and is full. After the meeting, the Party Committee quickly solved the specific problems of leadership raised by the workers one by one. Grasp Ideology, Grasp Technology

Then, at the Party Committee meeting to study the key issues of the factory, the Factory Party Committee listed the work behind the pig iron furnace as one of the key issues of the factory, and put forward the slogan of "political work entering the material yard and the charging port." According to the instructions of the Party Committee, the Party Branch of the workshop adopted the method of "Secretary grasping the back of the furnace, foreman grasping the front of the furnace, and the workshop director managing both ends," concentrating the main force to strengthen the leadership of the back of the furnace. They also changed the production organization, dividing the original two groups, front and back of the furnace, into one group. At the same time, led by the deputy director of the workshop, and absorbing old workers from the pig iron furnace, they organized a technical training class for the pig iron furnace, combining the problems that appear in the pig iron furnace every day to give technical lessons to the feeding workers, helping workers improve their technical level. The leadership's attention gave the feeding workers great encouragement. They worked harder and harder, changing the past thinking of "just filling the furnace is enough," and everyone came up with ideas and methods to actively improve their work. After a period of efforts, the melting rate and desulfurization rate of the pig iron furnace have generally improved. The leadership then mobilized the workers to summarize their experience and summarized the feeding work into a "five-character scripture," namely: Pure (feeding materials without impurities), Accurate (feeding materials according to the material list, all weighing), Uniform (uniform distribution of materials), Full (keeping the material line), Qualified (qualified block size), and incorporated these characters into the operating procedures to consolidate and promote advanced experience. Front and Back of the Furnace Cooperate

The feeding workers also took the initiative to cooperate with the furnace workers to establish contact contracts. Whenever the feeding workers had free time, they would run to the front of the furnace to ask about the iron water situation, and sometimes go to the steelmaking platform to see the time waiting for the iron water and the rise and fall of sulfur in each furnace. If they found problems, they would promptly cooperate with the furnace workers to take measures to solve them. One day, Zhang Ningzhi, a feeding worker in Class C, went to the front of the furnace to understand the situation of the pig iron furnace. Wang Hongchang and Sun Jinjiang, the furnace watch workers, said to him: "The sulfur in the iron water is still high, and the blowing time in the converter is still long." Several people looked at the tuyeres and found that there was a possibility of slagging. Then they opened a joint meeting and decided to adopt the methods of adding bottom carbon, adding fluorite, and adding less additional materials to prevent slagging accidents and further improve desulfurization efficiency. Two hours later, the sulfur decreased, and when they looked at the tuyeres of the pig iron furnace, each one was clear, ensuring the shortening of the steelmaking smelting time.

Now, the workers in front of and behind the pig iron furnace of this factory are as united as one person. Everyone discusses things when something happens, solves problems together, cares for each other, and helps each other. The entire pig iron furnace workshop has a new look. In October, the average melting rate of the three groups of pig iron furnaces increased by 12.8% compared with September, and in the first ten days of November, it increased by 22.5% compared with October. The desulfurization efficiency was also gradually improved, and the iron water temperature was maintained above 1350 degrees, creating conditions for high steel production.

    先做学生后做先生  集思广益多谋善断
    津钢三厂依靠群众突破化铁炉薄弱环节保证增产
    本报讯　据天津日报消息：天津第三钢厂领导干部深入生产第一线。先做学生后做先生，摸清了化铁炉生产的炉后薄弱环节，加强了进料工序的政治思想工作，迅速扭转了化铁炉生产不够稳定的情况，保证了钢产量的不断增长。
    在前一阶段，这个厂根据“以炼钢为中心，以化铁炉为重点”的精神，对化铁炉进行了技术改造，并且狠抓熔化工序，解决了开新炉时间长等关键问题，使化铁炉的生产水平有了很大提高。最近，这个厂的钢产量又跳跃式上升，达到了从未有过的水平。在这种情况下，化铁炉的熔化率和脱硫率常常不能满足转炉的需要，化铁炉又成为全厂性的薄弱环节。为了弄清情况，解决这个问题，党委书记和厂长本着“先当学生，后当先生”的精神，到化铁炉工段去访问工人。开“诸葛亮会”
    他们来到化铁炉前，首先把当前化铁炉不能适应炼钢炉需要的问题，向群众全面交底，动员大家找问题，找原因。工人们都积极地向领导上反映情况。炉前工说：化铁炉熔化率和脱硫效率的波动主要在接班以后的前三炉，过去前三炉慢慢就正常了。为什么前三炉有波动？化铁炉老工人徐复善说：“化铁炉的好坏，和进料有很大关系。”也有人说：“在交班以前赶着出铁水，接班以后赶着加铁加炭，就造成了接班以后头三炉的不衔接。”工人们谈的情况，对领导上有很大启发。他们又到炉后召开进料工人座谈会。座谈会上发言很踊跃。有人说：“我们进料工人就是搬大铁的，装满了炉子就行啦，铁水化得快慢那是炉前技术工人的事，我们就不操那份心。”进料老工人韩德玉不同意这种看法。他说：“料在我们手里把着，哪是好铁、坏铁，心里都有个数，交班的时候，上料来个两低一高（熔剂低、炭低、铁高），化铁炉就吃不好，如果来个两高一低（熔剂高、炭高、铁低），化铁炉就吃不饱。”旁边又有人答腔说：“进料单子是死的，人是活的，只要我们掌握住铁的变化情况，灵活配料，炉前的问题就不大。”会上还有人主动检查了自己的缺点；也有人给领导上提出了意见：“领导上就是以化铁炉为重点，可是一抓化铁炉就是到炉前去，炉后没有人来。我们料场里的探照灯坏了好久，没人管，每天摸着黑上料，还谈什么‘精料’。”大家越谈越痛快，越谈问题越明确。最后党委书记说：“咱们炼钢厂好像一台戏，主角是炼钢的，而我们进料工人就是后台管化妆、管剧务的人，没有我们这伙人，主角本事再大，这台戏也唱不成。”工人们听了以后，都感到自己责任重大，大家一致表示：今后一定要和炉前工人配合好，认真地配料，保证化铁炉吃得又饱又好。”会后，党委又迅速把工人提出的领导方面的具体问题一一解决了。抓思想　抓技术
    接着，工厂党委在研究全厂关键问题的党委会上，把化铁炉炉后工作列为全厂性的关键之一，提出了“政治工作进料场、上料口”的口号。车间党总支根据党委的指示，采取了“书记抓炉后，工长抓炉前，车间主任两头管”的办法，集中主要力量加强炉后的领导。他们还改变了生产组织，把原来炉前炉后的两个组划成了一个组。同时，他们以车间副主任为首，吸收化铁炉老工人，组织了化铁炉技术传授班，结合每天化铁炉出现的问题，给进料工人讲技术课，帮助工人提高技术水平。领导上的重视，给了进料工人们很大鼓舞。他们越干越有劲，改变了过去“只管装满炉就完了”的思想，人人出主意、想办法，积极改进工作。经过一段努力，化铁炉的熔化率和脱硫率普遍提高。领导上又发动工人总结经验，把进料工作总结出“五字经”，即：纯（进料不带杂质）、准（照料单进料，一律过磅）、匀（料的分布均匀）、满（保持料线）、合（块度合格），并且把这几个字纳入操作规程，使先进经验得到巩固和推广。炉前炉后大协作
    进料工人们还主动和炉前工人开展协作，建立联系合同。进料工人一有空就跑到炉前去问铁水的情况，有时还到炼钢台上去看看每炉等铁水的时间和硫的升降情况，发现问题，就及时配合炉前工人采取措施来解决。一天，丙班进料工人张宁之到炉前去了解化铁炉的情况时，炉前的看火工人王洪昌和孙金江对他说：“铁水的硫还是高，转炉的吹炼时间还是长。”几个人看了看风眼，发现有发渣的可能，跟着他们就开了个联席会，决定采取补底炭、加莹石、少上附加料的办法，来防止发渣事故，并且进一步提高脱硫效率。两个小时以后，硫下降了，再看化铁炉的风眼，个个通明，保证了炼钢熔炼时间的缩短。
    现在，这个厂化铁炉炉前炉后工人团结得像一个人，有事大家商量，有问题一起解决，互相关心，互相帮助，整个化铁炉工段面貌一新。10月份，三组化铁炉的平均熔化率比9月份提高了12.8％，11月上旬又比10月提高了22.5％，脱硫效率也逐步提高，铁水温度一直保持在一千三百五十度以上，为钢的高产创造了条件。
