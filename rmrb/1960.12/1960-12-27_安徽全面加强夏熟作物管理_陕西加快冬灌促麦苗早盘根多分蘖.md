Anhui Comprehensively Strengthens Summer Crop Management
Shaanxi Accelerates Winter Irrigation to Promote Early Rooting and Tillering of Wheat Seedlings

(Our report) Anhui Province, after the basic completion of the "Three Autumns" work, is advancing victoriously. While vigorously grasping the "Little Autumn Harvest," it is rapidly launching a field management campaign centered on checking seedlings, replanting, and topdressing for summer crops, ensuring full and robust summer crop seedlings. According to incomplete statistics, by early December, more than 3 million mu of wheat and rapeseed had been topdressed once, more than 2 million mu of missing wheat and rapeseed seedlings had been replanted, and more than 5 million mu of wheat and rapeseed fields had their furrow ditches cleared.

Since the province had a large area of late autumn crops this year, with late maturity and late stubble clearing, and some late-planted wheat was planted hastily to combat drought, the growth of some late-planted wheat is not as good as that of early-planted wheat. In order to vigorously promote late-planted wheat to catch up with early-planted wheat, all localities have paid special attention to strengthening the management of late-planted wheat in the field management of summer crops, and have carried out replanting and fertilization of late-planted wheat fields. In Yinghe Commune, Shouxian County, all production teams, while managing early- and mid-season wheat fields well, have, according to the current growth of late-planted wheat, not only rushed to replant missing seedlings in late-planted wheat fields to ensure a basic seedling count of 200,000 plants per mu, but also topdressed all late-planted wheat with quick-acting fertilizers such as human and animal manure to promote early tillering and early rooting. At the same time, they also promptly cleared ditches and drained water from low-lying and waterlogged late-planted wheat fields to ensure normal growth of wheat seedlings. In Quanjiao County, all people's communes, when rushing to topdress late-planted wheat seedlings, adopted the method of applying fertilizer along the furrows for strip-sown wheat fields and digging holes for fertilizer application for dibbled wheat fields, which not only saved fertilizer and used fertilizer rationally, but also gave full play to the fertilizer effect. The late-planted wheat seedlings in the county that had been topdressed have greatly improved.

In the summer crop management campaign, all localities, in the spirit of grasping everything thoroughly and deeply, not only grasped the management of summer crops in near fields, fertile fields, high-yielding fields, and large fields, but also grasped the management of summer crops in far fields, thin fields, general fields, and scattered plots, not only grasped wheat field management, but also grasped rapeseed and broad bean management, striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest of summer crops next year. All people's communes in He County, while managing food crops well, universally arranged for special personnel to manage rapeseed fields on a production team basis, and also promoted the "five guarantees" responsibility system of guaranteeing topdressing and weeding, guaranteeing full and strong seedlings, guaranteeing no drought or waterlogging, guaranteeing no diseases and insect pests, and guaranteeing no damage from livestock, which vigorously strengthened the management of rapeseed fields. More than 80% of the county's 50,000 mu of rapeseed have been topdressed with seedling fertilizer, and some rapeseed fields have also been surrounded with ash and covered with grass in conjunction with weeding to prevent freezing and keep warm. At the same time, prevention and treatment were carried out for more than 10,000 mu of rapeseed with varying degrees of diseases and insect pests. Guanzhuang Brigade of Huangcun People's Commune in Jingxian County mobilized commune members to conduct a general survey of crops in scattered plots and remote thin fields, and focused on topdressing more than 150 mu of remote thin fields with fine fertilizers such as chemical fertilizers and human and animal manure. The second production team of this brigade had 18 mu of scattered broad beans with many weeds and little fertilizer, and poor growth. After the commune members rushed to weed and topdress, they achieved clean weeds and sufficient fertilizer, and vigorous growth. Many areas have adopted methods such as composting fertilizer on the spot, burning straw manure on the spot, and applying more fine fertilizer to meet the needs of topdressing in remote thin fields, and vigorously promote strong and vigorous seedlings in remote thin fields, high yield and more income.

At present, the field management campaign of summer crops is being carried out in depth throughout the province. Party committees at all levels are further strengthening leadership, deeply mobilizing the masses to further strengthen management, and ensuring that summer crops next year will grow better than in any previous year.

Xinhua News Agency reported that Shaanxi Province is irrigating wheat fields in winter to promote early rooting and tillering of wheat seedlings and prevent spring drought. The Luohe Canal irrigation area, which has taken action more quickly, has now irrigated 240,000 mu of wheat fields, accounting for 80% of the area that should be irrigated, of which more than 26,300 mu have been irrigated twice. In Sanyuan and Xingping counties along the Jinghui Canal and Weihui Canal irrigation areas, winter irrigation is also very timely, with a total of 520,000 mu of wheat fields irrigated.

This year, Shaanxi has done a solid job in winter irrigation. As early as during the "Three Autumns," all localities combined autumn sowing with the construction of 7 million mu of ridge fields, storing 800 million cubic meters of water, and basically realized gardenization of 5.93 million mu of wheat fields. Subsequently, many areas organized labor to repair canals and inspect water lifting tools. As soon as the "Three Autumns" ended in Yanliang Commune, Lintong County, 14 technicians from the machinery factory and tractor station were transferred and formed into five groups, and within a few days, they promptly repaired all the commune's drainage and irrigation machinery and eight pumping stations, creating favorable conditions for this year's winter irrigation work.

The broad masses of commune members attach great importance to irrigation quality. In particular, the three old irrigation areas of Jing, Luo, and Wei have universally promoted the activities of changing large ridges to small ridges, long ridges to short ridges, and wide ridges to narrow ridges, realizing small ridge irrigation. Before irrigation, the Hexiang Production Team of Huazhou Commune in Weinan County first asked experienced commune members to try irrigation, and taught techniques of water saving such as shallow irrigation with small amounts of water, uniform irrigation, and not flooding wheat on the spot, so that the water acceptance rate per mu increased from 70% to 80% in channels with the same flow rate.

### 安徽全面加强夏熟作物管理  陕西加快冬灌促麦苗早盘根多分蘖

    安徽全面加强夏熟作物管理
    陕西加快冬灌促麦苗早盘根多分蘖
    本报讯　安徽省“三秋”工作基本结束以后，各地正乘胜前进，在大抓“小秋收”的同时，迅速开展了一个以查苗、补苗和追肥为中心的夏熟作物田间管理运动，确保夏熟作物苗全苗壮。据不完全的统计，到12月上旬，已有三百多万亩小麦、油菜追过一次肥，二百多万亩缺苗的麦、菜补齐了苗，并有五百多万亩麦、菜田清理了畦沟。
    由于今年全省晚秋作物面积大，成熟迟，腾茬晚，有部分晚茬麦又是抗旱抢种的，因而有些晚茬麦生长情况不如早茬麦。为了力促晚茬麦赶上早茬麦，各地在夏熟作物田间管理中都特别注意加强晚茬麦的管理，对晚茬麦田进行补苗补肥。寿县迎河公社各生产小队在管好早中茬麦田的同时，根据当前晚茬麦的生长情况，除给缺苗断垅的晚茬麦突击补苗，保证每亩达到二十万株基本苗外，对所有晚茬麦还追施人畜粪等速效肥，促使早分蘖早盘根。同时还及时地对低洼易涝的晚茬麦田进行了清沟沥水，保证麦苗正常生长。全椒县各人民公社在突击给晚茬麦苗追肥时，采取条播麦田顺垅施肥，点播麦田挖穴施肥的方法，既做到节约用肥、合理用肥，又充分发挥了肥效。全县经过追肥的晚茬麦苗都大有起色。
    在夏熟作物管理运动中，各地本着抓全抓深抓透的精神，既抓近田、肥田、丰产田和大田夏熟作物的管理，也抓远田、薄地、一般田和零星地夏熟作物的管理，既抓麦田管理，又抓油菜田和蚕豌豆的管理，力争明年夏熟全面大丰收。和县各人民公社在管好粮食作物的同时，普遍以生产组为单位安排专人管理油菜田，并都推行了保追肥锄草、保全苗旺苗、保不旱不涝、保无病虫害、保不受牲畜糟蹋的“五保”责任制，有力地加强了油菜田的管理。全县五万亩油菜已有80％以上追施了苗肥，有些油菜田还结合锄草进行了围灰、盖草，以防冻保温。同时还给一万多亩有不同程度病虫害的油菜进行了防治。泾县黄村人民公社官庄大队发动社员对零星地和远田薄地作物进行了一次普查，对一百五十多亩远田薄地重点追施了化肥、人畜粪等精细肥料。这个大队的第二生产小队有十八亩零星地蚕豌豆草多肥少，生长较差，经社员们突击锄草、追肥后，达到草净肥足，生长旺盛。许多地区对远田薄地采取就地沤肥、就地烧火粪以及多施细肥等方法，满足远田薄地追肥需要，力促远田薄地苗壮苗旺，高产多收。
    目前，全省各地夏熟作物的田间管理运动正深入开展。各级党委正进一步加强领导，深入发动群众进一步加强管理，保证明年夏熟作物长得比以往任何一年都要好。
    据新华社讯　陕西省各地正在冬灌麦田，促进麦苗早盘根、多分蘖，预防春旱。行动较快的洛惠渠灌区现在已经灌溉麦田二十四万亩，占应灌面积80％，其中灌溉两次的达到二万六千三百多亩。沿泾惠渠、渭惠渠灌区的三原、兴平等县，冬灌也很及时，共灌溉麦田五十二万亩。
    今年陕西各地冬灌工作做得扎实。早在“三秋”期间，各地就结合秋播打好畦子七百万亩，蓄水八亿立方米，有五百九十三万亩麦田基本上实现了园田化。接着，许多地区又组织劳力整修了渠道和检查了提水工具。临潼县阎良公社“三秋”刚一结束，就抽调机械厂、拖拉机站技工十四人，编成五个小组，几天工夫就把全社的排灌机械和八个抽水站及时检修完毕，为今年冬灌工作创造了良好的条件。
    广大社员群众都非常重视灌溉质量，特别是泾、洛、渭三个老灌区，普遍推行了大畦改小畦、长畦改短畦、宽畦改窄畦的活动，实现了小畦灌溉。渭南县华州公社河巷生产队灌溉前先请有经验的社员试灌，就地传授小水浅灌、匀灌、不淹麦等节约用水的技术，在同等流量的渠道里，使每亩地的受水率由70％提高到80％。
