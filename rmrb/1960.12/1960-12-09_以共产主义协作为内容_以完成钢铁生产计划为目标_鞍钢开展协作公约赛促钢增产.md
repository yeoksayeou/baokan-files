Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, December 8th. In the struggle to strive to complete this year's steel production plan, Anshan Iron and Steel workers, with the party's grassroots organizations as the core, production teams as the foundation, communist cooperation as the content, and promoting the completion of the annual steel production plan as the goal, are carrying out a communist collaboration covenant competition.

The communist collaboration covenant competition was initiated by the Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Steelmaking Plant. In early October, in order to increase steel production for the country, the plant's workers universally formulated a one-stop collaboration covenant between upper and lower processes; a mutual assistance collaboration covenant among the same types of work between furnaces and teams; a mutual collaboration covenant between individuals; and temporary collaboration covenants for relevant units to solve key problems in production. These types of covenants are interwoven and closely combined, linking together more than one hundred processes and three hundred teams throughout the plant. Each unit proposes guarantee conditions to each other based on the requirements of the national plan, strictly implements them, and conducts regular evaluations. For example, each team (furnace) in the open hearth workshop stipulates in the collaboration covenant: Open hearth workers guarantee to conscientiously implement the operating principles of "more charging, quick smelting, high temperature, and long life," maintain the furnace body well, and tap steel according to the steel type; raw material workers guarantee that the qualification rate of raw materials used for steelmaking reaches more than 60%, supply seven or eight molten iron ladles per shift, and supply molten iron and scrap steel in a timely manner; ingot casting workers ensure that steel ladles are hung up within fifteen minutes after the open hearth signals tapping; mold preparation workers ensure that molds are prepared twenty minutes before tapping, and the number of mold sets supplied matches the number of steel furnaces tapped; molten iron furnace workers "deliver to the door" and tap molten iron on time; and transportation workers ensure quick charging and coordination with the open hearth for rapid steelmaking. In this way, upper and lower processes, and neighbors are tightly linked, all acting in accordance with the covenant, thus greatly shortening the smelting time of each furnace of steel.

The Anshan Municipal Party Committee and the Anshan Iron and Steel Party Committee promptly summarized and promoted their experience, enabling this competition to quickly spread throughout Anshan Iron and Steel's various factories and mines. Now, this competition has developed from within a steel plant to the entire Anshan Iron and Steel production system; from ore raw material production departments to steel rolling departments, from main workshops to auxiliary departments, from team to team to inter-factory, from within factories and mines to between factories and workers' families. Communist collaboration covenants have been established, making Anshan Iron and Steel, this modern combined enterprise, with its various processes, units, and even teams, form a crisscrossing communist collaboration network, so that various production activities are established on a solid organizational and conscious ideological foundation.

In the communist collaboration covenant competition, the broad masses of workers are actively and strictly implementing the collaboration covenants. Open hearth furnace chiefs and workers in the steelmaking plant strictly implemented the "start working as soon as you are on duty, and don't leave for four things when you are off duty" (that is, if the off-duty time coincides with tapping, blocking the furnace door, charging, or patching the front and rear walls of the open hearth, don't leave, stay to help the next shift). Wei Jifu, the leader of the molten iron furnace team of the B team of the raw material section of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant and a communist party member, in order to fulfill the collaboration covenant, improve the raw material qualification rate, and promote rapid steelmaking, temporarily moved into the factory, checked records furnace by furnace in detail, summarized everyone's experience, and personally inspected the molten iron ladles on the vehicles. After finding the reason for the fluctuation of the raw material qualification rate, he took strong measures to make the raw material qualification rate of the whole team exceed the provisions of the collaboration covenant, and was rated as a red flag team. Various teams, processes, workshops, and even inter-factories, also conducted self-initiated, layer-by-layer inspections and regular evaluations in accordance with the collaboration covenant competition, thereby promoting the development of this competition.

The widespread development of the communist collaboration covenant competition has promoted new atmospheres in the production of many units. The average daily steel production of the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant in November increased by 2.1% compared to October, and the smelting time per furnace of steel was shortened by forty-one minutes. The output of refractory bricks from the Refractory Materials Plant in the second half of October increased sharply by 20.3% compared to the first half of the month, and the first-class rate of magnesia bricks increased by 12%; in November, it overfulfilled the monthly production plan by 3.6%.

### 以共产主义协作为内容　以完成钢铁生产计划为目标  鞍钢开展协作公约赛促钢增产

    以共产主义协作为内容　以完成钢铁生产计划为目标
    鞍钢开展协作公约赛促钢增产
    据新华社鞍山8日电　鞍钢职工在力争完成今年钢产量计划的斗争中，以党的基层组织为核心，以生产班组为基础，以共产主义协作为内容，以促进完成钢铁生产年计划为目的，开展共产主义协作公约赛。
    共产主义协作公约赛，是鞍钢第一炼钢厂创始的。10月初，这个厂的职工为了给国家增产更多的钢，普遍制订了上下工序之间的一条龙协作公约；炉与炉、组与组的同工种互助协作公约；个人与个人相互协作公约；以及有关单位解决生产中关键问题的临时性协作公约。这几种类型的公约，纵横交织，紧密结合，把全厂一百多个工序、三百多个班组串连起来，各个单位都根据国家计划的要求相互提出保证条件，严格执行，定期评比。例如，平炉车间各班组（炉），在协作公约上规定：平炉工人保证认真贯彻“多装、快炼、高温、长寿”的操作方针，维护好炉体，按钢种出钢；原料工人保证炼钢用的原料合格率达到60％以上，每班供应铁水罐七、八个，铁水和废钢料供应及时；铸锭工人作到平炉打响出钢钟后，在十五分钟内挂好钢水罐；整模工人保证在出钢前二十分钟内，把模子准备好，出多少炉钢就供应多少套模子；混铁炉工人“送货上门”，按时兑铁水；运转工人保证作到快装料、配合好平炉快速炼钢。这样，上下工序、左邻右舍，环环扣紧，都按照公约办事，因此大大缩短了每炉钢的熔炼时间。
    中共鞍山市委和鞍钢党委及时总结推广了他们的经验，使这一竞赛运动，很快地在鞍钢各厂矿普遍开展起来。现在，这一竞赛，已从一个钢厂内部发展到整个鞍钢各生产系统；从矿石原料生产部门到轧钢部门，从主体车间到辅助部门，从班组之间到厂际之间，从厂矿内各单位之间到工厂和职工家属之间，都订立了共产主义协作公约，使鞍钢这个现代化的联合大企业的各工序、各单位直到各班组，组成了一个纵横交错的共产主义大协作网，使各种生产活动，建立在严密的组织和自觉的思想基础之上。
    在共产主义协作公约竞赛运动中，广大职工都主动严格地执行协作公约。炼钢厂的平炉炉长和工人，都严格地执行了公约规定的“上班就动手，下班四不走”（即下班时间赶上出钢、堵炉门、装料、补贴平炉前后墙时不走，留下来帮下班忙）。第一炼钢厂原料工段乙班混铁炉小组长、共产党员魏吉富，为了履行协作公约规定，提高原料合格率，促进快速炼钢，他就临时搬到厂内住，一炉一炉详细查记录，总结大家的经验，亲自检查车上的铁水罐，找到了原料合格率波动的原因之后，又采取了有力的措施，使全组的原料合格率超过了协作公约的规定，被评为红旗小组。各班组、各工序、各车间以至厂际之间，还按着协作公约赛进行了自下而上的层层检查、定期评比，从而促进了这一竞赛运动的发展。
    广泛开展共产主义协作公约赛，促使不少单位的生产出现了新气象。第二炼钢厂11月份钢的平均日产量比10月份增长2.1％，每炉钢的熔炼时间，缩短四十一分钟。耐火材料厂的耐火砖产量，10月下半月比上半月猛增20.3％，镁砖一级品率提高12％；11月又超额3.6％完成了全月生产计划。
