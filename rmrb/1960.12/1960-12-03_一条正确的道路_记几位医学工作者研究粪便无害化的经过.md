    A Correct Path
    ——Recording the Research Process of Several Medical Workers on Harmless Treatment of Feces
    By our reporter Tian Peizhi
    A work group composed of medical workers from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Anhui Medical College, among other units, arrived in Quanjiao County, Anhui Province, in the summer of 1959 to research harmless treatment of feces. After more than a year of effort, they initially achieved a set of simple and easy-to-implement comprehensive measures for the harmless treatment of feces. These measures are currently being promoted in Anhui, Shanghai, and other places, with good results. They can both kill hookworm and schistosomiasis eggs and typhoid and dysentery germs, improving sanitation; and increase fertilizer accumulation, improving fertilizer efficiency, which has a significant effect on protecting the health of the masses and promoting production development.
    Recently, this reporter visited several comrades in this work group. They unanimously said that achieving such good research results was due to embarking on the correct path taught by Chairman Mao: intellectuals should go to the countryside.

    Going to the Countryside
    Going to the countryside, the medical workers researching harmless treatment of feces did not embark on this correct path smoothly. Professor Zhao Yunwen of Anhui Medical College recounted a tortuous journey to the reporter.
    Professor Zhao is fifty years old this year. Before liberation, he participated in schistosomiasis prevention and control work many times, travelling to Jiaxing and Qu County in Zhejiang Province. As a result, the schistosomiasis prevention and control work did not achieve any results, and academic research also made no progress. After liberation, he participated in the schistosomiasis prevention and control work team organized by the Party and the government. From several in-depth visits to the grassroots and practical work, he discovered that the harmless treatment of feces was the key to preventing and controlling schistosomiasis and other parasitic diseases. He also saw some fragmented materials from the Japanese "Improved Toilet Research," so he and another professor began to research using toilets to make feces harmless. In 1956, the research work on harmless treatment of feces was included in the national plan, and the Party group of the Provincial Health Department also made a decision to vigorously conduct research on harmless treatment of feces. Professor Zhao and his colleagues gradually broke the superstition that scientific research could not be conducted without literature, and moved from the narrow laboratory to the vast world – the countryside.
    They successively opened pilot projects for harmless treatment in rural areas such as Anqing and Feixi, and five or six comrades also joined the research ranks.
    The Great Leap Forward of 1958, the establishment of people's communes, and the collectivization of people's lives put forward a more urgent task for eliminating pests and diseases and for the research work on harmless treatment of feces, and also created more favorable conditions. The great revolution in political ideology further transformed the ideological consciousness of intellectuals, and the Party had new instructions for health work. In May 1959, a national professional group meeting on harmless treatment of feces was held, deciding to promote the spirit of communist cooperation and vigorously conduct research work on harmless treatment of feces. In June, a research work group on harmless treatment of feces was formed by the Institute of Parasitic Diseases of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Anhui Medical College, and the Anhui Provincial Local Disease Prevention and Control Institute, among other units, and went deep into Quanjiao County. The research work on harmless treatment of feces entered a new stage from then on.

    Into the Crucible of Labor
    "Participating in physical labor is a required course for the research work on harmless treatment of feces." Professor Chen Yuqing of the Institute of Parasitic Diseases of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, used this sentence to summarize her deep experience in participating in physical labor to the reporter.
    In March of this year, Professor Chen and everyone else moved bricks, carried water, dug pits, and built walls to construct a harmless toilet for one hundred people. This was designed by her, starting from the theory of a one-to-five ratio of feces to water. The cesspool was built very large, and it could only be taken out after more than two months. This produced a contradiction with the urgent need for fertilizer in spring plowing. They carried water and manure into the first pool to speed up the fertilizer production time. However, the cesspool was too large, and their physical strength was weak (the commune members were all busy with spring plowing production). More than a dozen people worked hard for a long time, and only filled a few inches in the pool. With great difficulty, they filled it up one load at a time. After a few days, the fertilizer leaked from the bottom of the pool. They had to carry it out one load at a time to repair it. The physically weak Professor Chen participated in these heavy physical labors from beginning to end, which made her realize that doing so was too wasteful of work and effort, prompting her to continue her research. Later, she found that the theory of a one-to-five ratio of water to manure lacked a basis, and that people's urine would not use that much water; and also found that the calculation of each person's daily stool volume was also unrealistic. Rural commune members are different from office cadres. Commune members work in the fields during the day, and the actual stool volume in the toilet naturally decreases; also found that the location of the toilet was not suitable, and commune members did not use it. Based on these new situations, she and everyone else redesigned and built a toilet, saving labor, saving materials, shortening fertilizer production time, and meeting actual needs.
    Through practical physical labor, they explored many good methods for saving labor, saving materials, and saving time. For example, the original three-pool egg sedimentation tank used wooden plugs to block the pipes connecting the pools, and the plugs were pulled out regularly to allow the manure to flow. After field construction and operation, it was found that pulling out the wooden plugs was dirty and laborious, and the date had to be calculated, which was very troublesome. So, they tried to rebuild it into a one-pool, four-compartment, self-flowing sedimentation tank. As long as the manure was poured into the first compartment, it could be taken from the fourth compartment at any time after more than ten hours, which greatly facilitated the operation and fertilizer use of the commune members, and also saved a lot of construction costs and labor.

    Taking the Masses as Teachers
    Common labor has brought the intellectuals and the peasant masses closer together. All members of the group, whether professors, experts, teaching assistants, or doctors, put down their airs and took the masses as teachers.
    When they first arrived, the comrades in the work group conducted a water boiling egg killing experiment. On an open space, they built pools and stoves, put the manure in a large pot, and used coal and rice husks to start a fire to boil it. The effect was very good. When heated to fifty-five degrees, all the insect eggs and germs in the manure were killed thoroughly, without affecting the fertilizer efficiency. Everyone was so happy that they danced and cheered, thinking that this was a good method that was easy to promote. However, the reaction of the masses of the commune members was very cold. Some people smiled and walked away, and some commune members directly criticized, saying: It's really strange, the pot is used for cooking, and you use it to cook feces! The medical staff explained that the boiling method is the most thorough way to kill germs and eggs. The commune members asked in return, "Can't you think of other methods?" They also told them that coal is very scarce here, and rice husks also have other uses. It is a pity to burn them, and they provided them with some other harmless treatment methods. On the same day, the comrades in the work group held a meeting to summarize. After debate, everyone realized that this method wastes fuel and does not conform to the habits of the masses, so they made a new research plan. The next day, they went to the fields and chatted with the commune members while working, absorbing the opinions of the masses and the experience of harmless treatment.
    Learning from the masses has gradually become a conscious action of medical workers. Some comrades in the commune greenhouse saw commune members using livestock manure and weeds to pile up to generate heat for insulation, so they learned humbly. Based on this, they successfully researched the method of harmless treatment using biological heat, which is to surround the manure tank filled with manure with weeds, garbage, and livestock manure. After exposure to the sun, the temperature increases, the insect eggs and germs in the tank are killed, and the weeds and garbage outside are also turned into fertilizer. Every time they design a new harmless model or drawing, they hold a small exhibition, inviting commune members and cadres to visit, to listen to the opinions of the masses and make further improvements. They have established close friendships with the commune members, being primary school students of the masses, summarizing the experience of the masses, and at the same time, holding training classes to impart harmless treatment and health science knowledge to the commune members. Learning from each other, researching each other, enriching and promoting scientific research work. The harmless treatment methods have developed from a single toilet to diversified and comprehensive methods such as sedimentation tanks, composting, and harmless treatment using biological heat. And learning the local methods of the masses, using indigenous methods instead of foreign ones, making use of local conditions and simple equipment, and using local materials, the operation technology is simplified, and the cost is also reduced, making this set of harmless treatment methods economical, practical, simple and easy to implement, and able to be widely promoted.

    Double Harvest of Professional Thought
    Going deep into the countryside, participating in labor, and learning from the masses has not only found a fast, good, and economical way for the research work on harmless treatment and achieved significant results, but also made the medical workers receive profound exercise in their ideological consciousness, improved their political awareness, and made them love their work even more. Xie Jinzhuo, the deputy leader of the work group, who is twenty-seven years old, told the reporter: "I want to dedicate my life to harmless treatment of feces and the people's health cause." He graduated from Guangzhou Zhongshan Medical College in 1956 and was assigned to work at the Institute of Parasitic Diseases of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. In 1958, when he started to research harmless treatment of feces, he was not at ease with his work. His personal interest was in internal medicine clinics. He thought that researching feces was dirty and smelly, and he was afraid that others would look down on him. Because he was carrying an ideological burden, he was often impatient and angry, which affected the unity of the comrades in the group and the research work. Cui Jingyi, the secretary of the Party general branch, enlightened him, saying: "Look further ahead, researching feces is to eliminate diseases, protect the health of hundreds of millions of people, and build socialism. Personal interests must start from here, and cannot be transferred by your own likes and dislikes and the opinions of others." The cultivation of the Party and the education of the masses of commune members, the boiling life and the hot labor, gradually corrected and consolidated his professional thinking. He repeatedly read "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists," and had a deeper understanding of what kind of person to be and how to work according to the requirements of the Party, and also developed a love for his work. The ideological outlook of all the comrades in the work group is undergoing profound changes day by day. In the past, when they saw people who were emptying the latrines in the city, they would cover their noses and run a few steps. If a little dust stuck to their clothes, they would wash them several times. Now they have changed. Whether it is hot summer or cold winter, they deal with feces all day long, scooping back and forth with iron spoons, pouring back and forth with glass tubes, observing, testing, testing, observing. Like the peasants, they regard feces as a precious thing.
    The Party's call to vigorously develop agriculture and vigorously develop grain has given the medical workers who are researching the harmless treatment of feces tremendous encouragement and strength. Some of the comrades in the work group stayed in Quanjiao County to continue their research, and most of the comrades have rushed to various places, promoting, experimenting, and improving at the same time, so that these advanced seeds can blossom and bear fruit everywhere!

    一条正确的道路
    ——记几位医学工作者研究粪便无害化的经过
    本报记者　田培植
    一个由中国医学科学院和安徽医学院等单位的医学工作者组成的工作组，在1959年夏天到了安徽省全椒县，他们是去研究粪便无害化的。经过一年多的努力，他们初步研究成功一套简便易行的粪便无害化的综合措施，目前正在安徽和上海等地推广，效果很好，既能杀灭血吸虫、钩虫等虫卵和伤寒、痢疾等病菌，搞好卫生；又能增积肥料，提高肥效，对保护群众健康和促进生产发展有很大作用。
    最近，记者访问了这个工作组的几位同志，他们一致说，取得这样良好的研究成果，是因为走上了毛主席所教导的：知识分子应该到农村去这条正确的道路。
    到农村去
    到农村去，研究粪便无害化的医学工作者走上这条正确的道路，不是一帆风顺的，安徽医学院赵韵闻教授向记者讲述了他的一段曲折的历程。
    赵教授今年五十岁，解放前曾多次参加过防治血吸虫病的工作，奔走在浙江嘉兴、衢县一带，结果血吸虫病的防治工作没有做出成绩，学术研究也无进展。解放后，他参加了党和政府组织的血防工作队，从几次深入基层、深入实际中发现，粪便无害化是防治血吸虫等寄生虫病的总关口，而且也看到日本“改良便所研究”的一些零碎材料，于是他就和另一位教授开始了利用厕所使粪便无害化的研究工作。1956年，粪便无害化的研究工作列入国家规划，省卫生厅党组也作出大搞粪便无害化研究的决定。赵教授他们逐步破除了没有文献不能搞科学研究的迷信，从狭小的实验室里，走到广阔的天地——农村。
    他们先后在安庆、肥西等地农村开辟了无害化的试点，有五、六位同志也加入了研究的行列。
    1958年的生产大跃进，人民公社的建立和人民生活的集体化，为除害灭病、为粪便无害化研究工作提出更迫切的任务，也创造了更有利条件，政治思想大革命进一步改造了知识分子的思想意识，党对卫生工作有了更新的指示，1959年5月，召开了全国粪便无害化专业小组会议，决定发扬共产主义的协作精神，大搞粪便无害化研究工作。6月份，由中国医学科学院寄生虫病研究所、安徽医学院和安徽省地方病防治所等单位组成粪便无害化研究工作组，深入到全椒县。粪便无害化研究工作从此进入了新的阶段。
    投入劳动的熔炉
    “参加体力劳动，是粪便无害化研究工作的一门必修课程。”中国医学科学院寄生虫病研究所陈玉清教授，用这句话向记者概括了她参加体力劳动的深切体会。
    今年3月，陈教授和大家一起，搬砖挑水、挖坑砌墙，修建了一个供一百人使用的无害化厕所。这是由她设计的，从粪和水一比五的理论出发，粪池修的很大，两个多月以后才能取粪，和春耕用肥的迫切需要产生了矛盾，他们就挑水担粪倒入第一池里，加快出肥的时间。可是粪池太大了，他们的体力又弱（社员都忙于春耕生产），十几个人累了半天，费了九牛二虎之力，池里才填满几寸。好容易一担一担地填满了，不几天，池底却漏肥了，他们又一担一担地挑出来才能修理。体弱的陈教授从头至尾参加了这些繁重的体力劳动，从中使她体会到这样做太误工费力了，促使她继续研究下去，后来发现水粪一比五的理论是缺乏根据的，再加上人的小便就用不了那么多水；又发现对每人每天的便量计算也是不切实际的，农村社员不同于机关干部，社员白天下田劳动，在厕所的实际便量自然减少了；还发现厕所修建的地点不适中，社员不去使用。根据这些新的情况，她和大家重新设计修建了一个厕所，省工、省料、缩短出肥时间，符合实际需要了。
    通过实际的体力劳动，他们摸索出很多省工、省料、省时间的好方法，比如，原先三池式虫卵沉淀池，池之间相通的管道是用木塞堵住，定时拔开，让粪液流动。经过实地修建和操作，发现拔木塞又脏、又费力，还得计算日期，很麻烦，就设法改建为一池四格式自流化沉淀池，只要把粪便倒在第一格里，十几小时后从第四格里可以随时取用，大大方便了社员操作和生产用肥，也节省了不少建筑费用和劳力。
    拜群众为师
    共同的劳动，密切了知识分子与农民群众的关系。全组同志，无论是教授、专家、助教、医师，都放下架子，拜群众为师。
    初来时，工作组的同志们曾进行过水煮灭卵的试验。在一块空地上，修池砌灶，把粪便盛在一口大锅里，用煤和稻糠生火煮沸，效果非常好，加温到五十五度，粪便内所有的虫卵病菌，都杀灭得一干二净，又不影响肥效。大家高兴得手舞足蹈，认为这是一种很好的而又便于推广的方法。可是，社员群众的反映却非常冷淡。有的过来笑一笑就走开了，有的社员直截了当地批评说：真是怪事，锅子是煮饭吃的，你们拿来煮大便！医务人员们解释说，煮的方法最能彻底杀菌灭卵。社员们反问道：“不会再想想别的方法吗？”并且告诉他们，这里煤很缺，稻糠还有用途，烧掉了太可惜，还给他们提供了一些别的无害化方法。当天，工作组的同志们开会，进行了总结。经过辩论，大家认识到，这种方法浪费燃料，不合群众习惯，便作出了新的研究方案。第二天，他们分头到田头和社员边劳动，边谈心，吸取群众的意见和无害化的经验。
    向群众学习逐步成为医学工作者的一种自觉的行动。有的同志在公社温室里，看到社员用畜粪、杂草堆起来发热保温，就虚心学习，在此基础上研究成功利用生物热无害化的方法，就是把盛满粪便的粪缸，外面用杂草、垃圾和畜粪围住，经太阳一晒，温度提高，缸内的虫卵病菌杀灭了，外面的杂草和垃圾也化为肥料。他们每次设计一种新的无害化的模型、图样，都要举办一次小型展览会，邀请社员、干部们前来参观，借以听取群众的意见，作进一步改进。他们和社员建立了亲密的友谊，做群众的小学生，总结群众的经验，同时，举办训练班，给社员传授无害化和卫生科学知识。互相学习互相研究，丰富和促进了科学研究工作。无害化的方法由单一的厕所，发展到沉淀池、堆肥、生物热无害化等多样化的综合性的方法，而且学习群众的土办法，以土代洋，因陋就简，就地取材，操作技术简单了，成本造价也减低了，使这套无害化的方法经济适用，简便易行，能够广泛推广。
    业务思想双丰收
    深入农村，参加劳动，向群众学习，不仅使无害化研究工作找到了多快好省的途径，取得重大成绩，而且使医学工作者在思想意识上受到深刻的锻炼，提高了政治觉悟，更加热爱自己的工作。工作组副组长、二十七岁的谢谨灼告诉记者说：“我要把终生献给粪便无害化和人民的卫生事业。”他是1956年从广州中山医学院毕业后被分配到中国医学科学院寄生虫病研究所工作的。1958年开始研究粪便无害化时不安心工作，个人的兴趣是内科临床，认为研究粪便又脏又臭，又怕别人瞧不起。由于带着思想包袱，经常急躁生气，影响了组内同志的团结和研究工作。党总支书记崔静宜启发他说：“把眼光放远点，研究粪便是为了消灭疾病，保护亿万人民的健康，建设社会主义。个人的兴趣要从这里出发，不能以自己的喜爱和别人的看法为转移。”党的培养和社员群众的教育，沸腾的生活和火热的劳动，使他逐渐端正和巩固了专业思想。他反复阅读“论共产党员的修养”，对做一个什么样的人，怎样按照党的要求去工作，有了深一步的理解，也对自己的工作产生了热爱。工作组所有同志的思想面貌，都在日益起着深刻的变化。过去，在城市里见到掏粪的人就会捂住鼻子跑几步，衣服上沾一点尘土就要洗几遍，现在他们变了，不管是炎夏，还是寒冬，他们成天和粪便打交道，用铁杓舀来舀去，用玻璃管倒来倒去，观察、化验，化验、观察，他们跟农民一样，把粪便看成是宝贵的东西。
    党的大办农业、大办粮食的号召，给研究粪便无害化的医学工作者以巨大的鼓舞和力量。工作组的部分同志留在全椒县继续研究，大部分的同志已经奔赴各地，边推广、边试验、边提高，让这颗先进的种籽在各地开花结果！
