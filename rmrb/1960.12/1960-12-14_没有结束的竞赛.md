    The employee meeting today was exceptionally lively, the club packed to the rafters. Outside, the rain poured down; inside, applause thundered incessantly. Merged together, it was almost impossible to distinguish the rain from the applause, both surging and echoing, one stronger than the other.

    Party Secretary Zhao's report was only halfway through when a burst of gongs and drums sounded, approaching from afar. Soon, a group of young men and women, carrying a bulletin of good news and beating gongs and drums, burst in. Then a burly man leaped onto the stage and boomed in a voice like a brass gong:

    "Dear Party Committee comrades, our maintenance team in the machine repair workshop, with the strong support and assistance of the Party and brother teams, has completed the overhaul of fifteen diesel engines twelve days ahead of schedule. We are here to report the good news to the assembly!" A burst of warm applause erupted from the audience. This young man was Zhang Dasong, the leader of the "Red Banner" maintenance team in the machine repair workshop, nicknamed "Tiger Pliers."

    Last week, when "Tiger Pliers" went to the workshop, he suddenly heard a commotion. He looked up and, good heavens, saw a dense crowd. On closer inspection, he saw a red paper edged with gold on the challenge stage. It read: "To vigorously support agriculture, fifteen diesel engines need to be overhauled, with a deadline of twenty days. It is said that the task is arduous and time is short, but supporting agriculture is a matter of course. Which heroes and good men will take the lead on the challenge stage?"

    What an enticing challenge! No sooner said than done, Yu Fa, the leader of the assembly team in the machine repair workshop, picked up a red pen and was about to write when a hand as strong as pliers grabbed it. Yu Fa looked back and saw it was "Tiger Pliers," and laughed: "What, you want to snatch it? Hehe, that won't do!" As he spoke, he was about to write. "Wait a minute, how many days will it take you to complete it?" "Tiger Pliers" asked. Yu Fa replied: "Eighteen days!" "Tiger Pliers" was delighted to hear this and said: "Forget it! Give it to me!" With that, he snatched the pen and wrote below: "Complete the task in sixteen days, Machine Repair Maintenance Team."

    Speaking of these two teams, one is a dragon and the other a tiger, each with its own strengths. They are also old rivals in the competition, evenly matched. In past competitions, they have always encouraged and supported each other, like brothers. However, at the last quarterly appraisal meeting, the assembly team won the red flag, and the maintenance team was unwilling to be outdone and decided to catch up with the advanced. This time, the maintenance team seized the first place on the challenge stage, and the assembly team said: "Last time we won the red flag, thanks to the support of the maintenance team. This time, we must also support our brother team."

    "Tiger Pliers" returned to his team and told them what had just happened. The young men were all delighted, full of spirit. It was already late autumn and early winter. Cold winds blew in gusts, freezing their hands numb. But they didn't care about these things and continued their intense battle.

    Two days passed, and only one of the fifteen diesel engines had been repaired, and none had been installed or test-run. "Tiger Pliers" calculated the time and felt uneasy. The next day, he convened a "three-in-one" Zhuge Liang meeting. Branch Secretary Zhang said to them: "The assembly team has more experience in assembly than you do, why not learn from them!" "Right!" "Tiger Pliers" slapped his thigh and was about to leave when he bumped into someone face to face. On closer inspection, hey! It turned out to be Yu Fa. Secretary Zhang smiled and said: "Good! Speak of Cao Cao, and Cao Cao arrives!" Yu Fa said: "I heard you've encountered a problem, come on! Let's take a look." Yu Fa rolled up his sleeves and started working. Everyone watched Yu Fa's skilled assembly technique and couldn't help but secretly praise him. In less than an hour, a diesel engine was assembled. "Tiger Pliers" watched carefully and remembered clearly. He immediately divided the parts into groups, one group for repair and one group for installation. In this way, when the repair was finished, the installation was also finished. "Tiger Pliers" squeezed Yu Fa's hand so hard that it hurt. Yu Fa quickly withdrew his hand and smiled: "I wish you victory!"

    In this way, the overhaul of the fifteen diesel engines was completed in eight days, just in time for the factory-wide employee meeting, so they came to report the good news. Party Secretary Zhao concluded: The assembly and maintenance teams have done a good job, and we must promote this spirit of cooperation. Now we have to rush to build eight water pumps, which are urgently needed and must be installed immediately. Which team will complete this task?"

    "Give it to us!" "Tiger Pliers" immediately opened his buffalo voice again and shouted.

    "No! This time it should be given to us!" Yu Fa also became anxious.

    Neither would give way. Finally, Secretary Zhao said: "How about this, each of you take four machines and have a friendly match!"

    "Good!" The applause, laughter, gongs and drums, and the sound of raindrops hitting the tin roof merged into one, just like a roaring, surging sea.

    没有结束的竞赛
    西宁煤机厂工人　郗辉庭
    今天的职工大会显得格外热闹，俱乐部里挤得满腾腾的。外面哗哗地下大雨，里面哗哗的掌声响个不停。它们汇合在一起，简直分不出哪是雨声哪是掌声，一个劲地哗哗地响，而且一阵强似一阵。
    党委赵书记的报告刚讲到半截，只听一阵锣鼓声，由远而近。一会，一队青年男女举着喜报，打着锣鼓闯进来。这时一名彪形大汉，一个箭步跳上台来，铜锣般的嗓音响开了：
    “亲爱的党委同志们，我们机修车间维修小组，在党和兄弟组的大力支持和协助下，提前十二天完成了十五台柴油机的大修任务。特向大会报喜！”台下响起了一阵热烈的掌声。这小伙子是机修车间维修红旗小组组长张大松。外号“老虎钳”。
    上星期，在“老虎钳”去车间时，忽听到一阵喧嚷声，抬头一望，好家伙，一片黑压压的人群，再仔细一瞧，喝，打擂台上贴着一张镶着金边的大红纸。写着：“为了大力支援农业，有十五台柴油机需要大修，限期二十天。有道是，任务艰巨时间短，支援农业理当然。哪位英雄与好汉，打擂台上头位占？”
    好让人心发痒的挑战词！说时迟那时快，机修车间的装配小组组长于发提起红笔正要写，没料到被一支钳子般有力的大手给攒住了。于发回头一瞧，见是“老虎钳”，便笑道：“怎么，想抢吗？嘿嘿，这可不行！”说着挥笔就要写。“等一等，你们多少天完成？”“老虎钳”又问道。于发答道：“十八天！”“老虎钳”一听高兴地说：“得了吧！给我！”说着夺过笔，在下面写了：“十六天完成任务，机修维修小组。”
    说起这两个小组，那真是一个蛟龙，一个猛虎，各有长短。他们也是竞赛中的老对手，不相上下。在历次的竞赛中，总是互相鼓励，互相支援，像兄弟一般。不过，在上次季度评比大会上，装配组得了红旗，维修组不甘示弱，决定要赶上先进。这回，维修组夺了擂台头阵，装配组说：“上次咱们夺红旗，亏得维修组的支援。这回，咱们也要支援兄弟组。”
    “老虎钳”回到组里，把刚才的事情一说，小伙子们个个欢欣鼓舞，意气风发。这时已经是秋末冬初的季节了。冷风阵阵袭来，冻的手发麻。可是，他们却不管这些，仍然进行着紧张的战斗。
    两天过去了，十五台柴油机只检修了一台，还没有安装、试车。“老虎钳”一算时间，心里好不自在。第二天就召开了“三结合”的诸葛亮会议。支部张书记向他们说：“装配组在装配上的经验比你们多些，还是去取经吧！”“对！”“老虎钳”一拍大腿正要走，刚一转脸，跟谁碰了个对面，仔细一瞧，嘿！原来是于发。张书记笑着说：“好！说曹操，曹操就到！”于发说：“听说你们遇到了关键，来！咱们看看。”只见于发把袖子一卷，干开了。大伙瞧着于发那熟练的装配技术，不由得暗暗称赞。没用一个钟头，一台柴油机装配起来了。“老虎钳”看的仔细，记的清楚。马上把机件分成组，检修一组安装一组，这样检修完了，安装也完了。“老虎钳”的一只大手把于发的手握的发疼，于发急忙抽回手，笑着说：“预祝你们胜利！”
    就这样，十五台柴油机的大修任务，在八天头上全部完成了，正好赶上开全厂职工大会，他们就赶来报喜。党委赵书记最后说：装配和维修两组的作法很好，要发扬这种协作精神。现在我们又要赶造八台抽水机，因为急等用，马上要安装。哪个组来完成这个任务？”
    “给我们！”“老虎钳”马上又亮开水牛嗓子，大嚷一声。
    “不行！这回该给我们！”于发也急了。
    两者互不相让。最后，赵书记说：“这样吧，你们每组四台，来个友谊赛吧！”
    “好！”全场掌声，欢笑声，锣鼓声，雨点拍打着铁皮房顶的声音混成一片，就好像波涛滚滚、汹涌澎湃的大海在咆哮。
