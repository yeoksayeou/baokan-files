     Congratulations on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations Between China and Somalia
     The People's Republic of China and the Somali Republic have decided to formally establish diplomatic relations. Somali Republic Prime Minister Abdirashid Ali Shermarke announced in a telegram to our Premier Zhou Enlai on December 14 that the government of the Somali Republic agrees with the Chinese government's proposal to establish diplomatic relations between China and Somalia, and hopes that the two governments will send ambassadorial-level diplomatic representatives to each other as soon as possible. Our Premier Zhou Enlai and Foreign Minister Chen Yi sent telegrams to Somali Prime Minister Shermarke and Foreign Minister Issa on December 16, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, to warmly congratulate the formal establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Somalia.
    The friendly exchanges between the Chinese people and the Somali people began more than a thousand years ago. In ancient times, the ancestors of our people organized fleets to trade as far as the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea. Records of Somalia appeared in ancient Chinese books long ago. In the early fifteenth century, Zheng He, the famous navigator in Chinese history, also visited the Somali Peninsula. In the past century, although friendly exchanges between the Chinese and Somali peoples have not been possible due to artificial obstacles created by imperialism and colonialism, the Chinese and Somali peoples have supported and cared for each other in their long-term struggle against imperialism and colonialism. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, especially after Somalia also got rid of its colonial status and achieved independence this year, it has been possible for the Chinese and Somali peoples to establish and develop friendly relations under new historical conditions. In recent years, many distinguished Somali friends have come to China for friendly visits. Now that China and Somalia have decided to establish diplomatic relations, this has further developed the friendship between the Chinese and Somali peoples.
    The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Somalia is fully in line with the common aspirations and common interests of our two peoples. Today, although the Chinese people have been liberated and the Somali people have achieved independence, both of our peoples are faced with the major tasks of building our own countries and opposing imperialist aggression. Therefore, the establishment and development of friendly relations between the two countries has become an urgent demand of our two peoples.
    As the people of African countries embark on the road to national independence, the friendly relations between the Chinese people and the people of African countries are developing rapidly. China has established diplomatic relations with African countries such as the United Arab Republic, Sudan, Morocco, Guinea, Ghana, and Mali; it has affirmed the principle of establishing diplomatic relations with the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria. Now, the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Somalia further shows that the establishment and development of friendly relations between China and African countries, and the increasing friendship between the Chinese and African peoples, is an inevitable trend of historical development, which cannot be stopped by any imperialism and reactionary forces.
    The Chinese people and the Somali people, the Chinese people and the people of African countries, in the common struggle against imperialism, not only were, are, and will be closely related and support each other. Every step forward in the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Somalia, China and other African countries has made a new contribution to the cause of unity of the Asian and African peoples.
    The decision to establish diplomatic relations between China and Somalia will be recorded as a glorious page in the history of Sino-Somali relations. The Chinese people wish the friendship between the Chinese and Somali peoples to last forever, and wish the Somali people continuous new achievements in the cause of safeguarding national independence and building their own country.

     祝贺中国和索马里建立外交关系
     中华人民共和国和索马里共和国已经决定正式建立外交关系了。索马里共和国总理阿卜杜勒·拉希德·舍马克在12月14日致我国周恩来总理的电文中宣布，索马里共和国政府同意我国政府关于中索两国建立外交关系的建议，并希望两国政府早日互派大使级的外交代表。我国周恩来总理和陈毅外交部长已在12月16日致电索马里舍马克总理和伊萨外交部长，代表中国政府和中国人民热烈祝贺中索两国的正式建交。
    中国人民和索马里人民的友好往来，远在一千多年以前就已经开始了。在古老的年代，我国人民的祖先组织船队远至波斯湾和红海一带进行贸易活动。在我国古代的典籍里，早就出现了关于索马里的记载。在十五世纪初，我国历史上著名的航海家郑和还曾到过索马里半岛。近百年间，虽然中索两国人民之间由于帝国主义和殖民主义所制造的人为的障碍，而没有可能发展友好的往来，但是，中索两国人民在长时期进行的反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中，却是互相支持和互相关怀的。在中华人民共和国成立之后，特别是在今年索马里也摆脱了殖民地地位而取得独立之后，中索两国人民就有可能在新的历史条件下建立和发展友好关系。近年来，有许多索马里的尊贵的朋友们到中国来进行了友好的访问。现在，中索两国已经决定建立外交关系，这就使中索两国人民的友谊获得了进一步的发展。
    中国和索马里两国建立外交关系，是完全符合于我们两国人民的共同愿望和共同利益的。今天，虽然中国人民已经获得了解放，索马里人民已经取得了独立，但是我们两国人民都面临着建设自己国家和反对帝国主义侵略的重大任务。因此，建立和发展两国的友好关系，就成了我们两国人民的迫切的要求。
    随着非洲各国人民走上民族独立的道路，中国人民和非洲各国人民的友好关系正在迅速地发展中。中国已经同阿联、苏丹、摩洛哥、几内亚、加纳和马里等非洲国家建立了外交关系；同阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府肯定了建立外交关系的原则。现在中索两国的建交，进一步表明，中国和非洲各国友好关系的建立和发展，中国人民和非洲人民之间友谊的日益增长，这是历史发展的必然趋势，是任何帝国主义和反动势力所不能阻挡的。
    中国人民和索马里人民，中国人民和非洲各国人民，在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中，不仅过去是、现在仍然是，而且将来也是休戚相关，互相支持的。中国和索马里，中国和其他非洲的国家的友好合作关系的每一步发展都对亚非人民的团结事业作出了新的贡献。
    中索两国建交的决定，将作为光辉的一页载入中索关系的史册。中国人民愿祝中索两国人民的友谊万古长青，愿祝索马里人民在维护民族独立和建设自己国家的事业中不断地取得新的成就。
