Give Full Play to the Role of Experienced Farmers, Improve Work, and Promote Production
Langying Production Team's First Team is Doing Finer Work and Has a Better Style
(Our dispatch) The first team of Langying Production Team in Qutan Commune, Ledu County, Qinghai Province, organized experienced farmers from poor and lower-middle peasants to form an "Experienced Farmer Advisory Group," which further strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses and enhanced the planning of the team's work. As a result, the production enthusiasm of each commune member was brought into play, and all work was at the forefront, becoming a red banner of Qutan Commune.

The first team of Langying Production Team has four deputy team leaders (one team leader, three deputy team leaders), all of whom are energetic and enthusiastic young people. In long-term practice, they have deeply realized that to do a good job in the production team, the most important thing is to resolutely act in accordance with the Party's policies; in their work, they must insist on consulting with the masses, especially humbly listening to the opinions of experienced farmers among the poor and lower-middle peasants. Therefore, in order to make soliciting opinions from the masses regular and systematic, this team invited six experienced farmers with rich agricultural production experience to form an "Experienced Farmer Advisory Group" in July this year. They are often consulted on production measures and labor arrangements for each farming season; according to the seasonal tasks and their specialties, they are assigned to be responsible for certain production tasks, and they put forward specific requirements in a timely manner, and are responsible for inspecting and accepting the quantity and quality of production. In addition to regularly convening experienced farmer advisory meetings to solicit their opinions on the work style and methods of cadres, the team leaders generally also absorb them into relevant team committee meetings to solicit their opinions on current production and various tasks. In order to better exert the enthusiasm of experienced farmers, they are sometimes absorbed into relevant meetings of the commune, brigade, or production team to listen to the transmission reports of the Party's policies, so as to use their personal experience and rich agricultural knowledge to transmit the Party's policies to the masses.

The cadres of the first team of Langying Production Team, giving full play to the enthusiasm of experienced farmers, have achieved great results in the team's work in the past three months:

First, because the team cadres have taken the mass line and established an experienced farmer advisory group, the team leaders, based on the rich experience of experienced farmers in various agricultural tasks, have specifically used the labor force, making the labor arrangement more meticulous and reasonable. For example, in this year's autumn harvest, according to the suggestions of experienced farmers, the team committee conducted a detailed ranking of the strength of the labor force, the distance of the land, etc., and decided to divide the work according to the strength, skill level, time, and local conditions. For example, people with relatively poor physical strength and women with children were sent to nearby areas, semi-laborers were sent to shallow mountains to cut Huangtian; and strong young commune members were sent to the mountains and dense crop fields with tall stalks to harvest. After this arrangement, not only was the harvesting completed 23 days ahead of the original plan, but also more than 400 mu of land were plowed.

Second, because experienced farmers often participate in commune, brigade, production team, and team meetings, they learn about the Party's various policies. As a result, these experienced farmers are not only the advisory staff of the team cadres, but also the policy propagandists of the team. For example, when this team was discussing the 1961 sowing plan, a few people believed that each labor force cultivated an average of 17 mu of land, which was "not careful in management," and proposed that the sowing area should be reduced and some land should be abandoned. As soon as this idea emerged, veteran farmer Mei Gongbajie, based on the Party's policy of planting more, producing high yields, and reaping more, combined with his own experience, said to the commune members: "Before entering the commune, we had few people, little manure, and weak draught animals. It was too much to plant too much, but that was in the past! Now that we are communalized, we have more people, more fertilizer, and stronger draught animals. It would be foolish not to eat the ready-made steamed buns by abandoning fertile land! Besides, the Party's policy is to plant more, produce high yields, and reap more. According to our many years of experience, there are many natural disasters here, and high yields alone are not enough, so we must plant more, even if hail hits this side, there will still be that side." The commune members felt that what he said made sense, so everyone expressed that this year they would definitely turn the stubble well, prepare enough fertilizer, and ensure that not an acre of land would be left uncultivated next year, and strive to plant more, produce high yields, and reap more.

Third, because experienced farmers and commune members can get along well in production and life, and can promptly solicit and collect opinions from the masses on production measures, labor arrangements, and the work style of cadres, the team asks experienced farmers to be advisors, so they can hear more opinions from the masses, further strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses. Because experienced farmers often reflect the opinions collected from the commune members to the team, the team cadres have increased their ears and eyes, and constantly improve the shortcomings in their work, improve their work style and work methods. Therefore, the commune members generally reflect that "the team's work is becoming more and more meticulous, and the cadres' work style is getting better and better."

    充分发挥老农作用　改进工作推动生产
    浪营生产队第一小队工作越做越细作风愈来愈好
    本报讯　青海乐都县瞿昙公社浪营生产队一小队，组织贫农、下中农中有经验的老农成立老农“参谋小组”，进一步密切了干部和群众关系，加强小队工作的计划性，从而发挥了每个社员的生产积极性，各项工作走在前面，成为瞿昙公社的一面红旗。
    浪营生产队一小队有四个小队长（一个队长，三个副队长），都是干劲大、热情高的青年人。他们在长期实践中，深深体会到，要把生产小队工作做好，最主要的是坚决按照党的政策办事；在工作中坚持同群众商量，尤其是虚心听贫农、下中农中有经验老农的意见。因此，这个小队为了把征求群众意见经常化、制度化，今年7月，请了有丰富的农业生产经验的六位老农成立了“老农参谋小组”，经常征求他们对各个农活季节的生产措施、劳动力安排的意见；根据季节的活路和他们的特长分工负责某项生产任务，及时提出具体要求，和负责检查验收生产数量、质量；小队长除了定期召集老农参谋会，征求他们对干部工作作风、工作方法等方面的意见外，一般还都吸收他们参加有关生产小队队委会议，征求他们对当前生产和各项工作上的意见。为了更好地发挥老农的积极性，有时还吸收他们参加公社、大队或生产队的有关会议，听取党的政策的传达报告，以便运用他们亲身体验和丰富的农业知识，把党的政策传达到群众中去。
    浪营生产队一小队干部，充分发挥老农的积极性，三个月以来使小队工作收到很大的效果：
    一、由于小队干部大走群众路线，成立老农参谋小组，小队长根据老农对各项农活的丰富经验，具体使用劳动力，使劳动力安排得更加细致，更加合理。如在今年秋收中，根据老农的建议，就劳动力强弱、土地远近等情况，小队队委进行了细致的排队后，决定因人、因事、因时、因地制宜地按体力按技术高低进行了分工。如把体力比较差的人和有孩子的妇女派到近地，半劳动力派到浅山割黄田；把身强体壮的青年社员派到山上和株高秆粗的稠庄稼地里收割。这样安排后，不仅使收割比原计划提前二十三天完成任务，而且还翻地四百多亩。
    二、由于老农们经常参加公社、大队、生产队、小队会议，了解到党的各项政策，结果这些老农们不仅是小队干部的参谋人员，而且也是小队的政策宣传员。如这个小队在讨论1961年播种计划时，有少数人认为，每个劳动力平均耕种十七亩地，“经营不细”，提出播种面积应该缩小，想丢掉一部分土地。这种思想刚一露头，老农梅公巴杰就根据党的多种、高产、多收的政策结合自己的经历向社员们说：“没入公社前咱人少、粪少、耕畜弱，播种多了务劳不过来，可这是过去呀！现在公社化了，咱人多、肥多、耕畜壮，再把肥肥的地丢掉，那真是放着现成的馍馍不想吃！再说党的政策是多种、高产、多收，根据我们多年经验，咱们这里自然灾害多，光高产是不行的，所以还要多种，就是雹子打了这边也还有那边。”社员感到他说的在理，于是大家纷纷表示今年一定把茬翻好，肥料准备足，保证明年一亩不留地全播种上，千方百计争取多种高产多收。
    三、由于老农和社员在生产和生活上都能打在一起，能及时征求和搜集群众对生产措施、劳动力安排和干部作风的意见，小队请老农当参谋，因而就能听到更多的群众意见，进一步密切了干部和群众的关系。由于老农们经常把收集社员们的意见反映给小队，使小队干部增加了耳目，及时不断改进工作中的缺点，改进工作作风和工作方法，因而社员普遍反映“队里工作越作越细，干部作风愈来愈好。”
