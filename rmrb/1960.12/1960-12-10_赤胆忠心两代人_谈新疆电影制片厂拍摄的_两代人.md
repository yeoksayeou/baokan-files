    Loyal Hearts, Two Generations
    ——On “Two Generations” Filmed by Xinjiang Film Studio
    Xie Fengsong
    The feature film "Two Generations," produced by Xinjiang Film Studio, is a good film, and its success is to be congratulated. In particular, as a product of a young film studio in a fraternal minority region, it is even more worthy of celebration.
    The film depicts the following tortuous and moving story: A female Communist Party member named Meng Ying is transferred from Beijing back to the construction site of the Lanxin Railway in Xinjiang to serve as the Party Committee Secretary. When she rides to the construction site on a bulldozer driven by a young bulldozer operator named Ali, she sees a vibrant construction scene along the way and is filled with emotion. At the same time, she sees a dilapidated碉楼 (blockhouse) on a hillside, which evokes a painful and bitter memory: Eighteen years ago, she and her lover, Zhao Bin, were engaged in revolutionary work in Xinjiang and were arrested and imprisoned together by the reactionary Sheng Shicai. Their child, who was not even one year old, was also imprisoned with them. Soon, the reactionaries murdered her husband, Zhao Bin, and then tried to kill her child. In a moment of great crisis, an elderly Uyghur man who came to visit the prison rescued the child. For eighteen years, Meng Ying has been fighting and working hard for the revolution, but she has never known whether her child lived or died. Now, she has come to the construction site and is fighting against new difficulties and obstacles on the road ahead, and is training a new generation like Ali for the Party. The new cause is developing, new people are growing, and she finally learns that the vigorous and daring bulldozer operator, Ali, is her child, lost for eighteen years; thus, mother and son are reunited.
    If an artwork wants to touch the hearts of the broad masses of audiences and readers, it is very important to have a tortuous and vivid story. However, any vivid story or tortuous plot can only serve its theme. "Two Generations" reflects, through a moving story, two completely different eras, the spirit of two generations of revolutionaries who are wholeheartedly and unyieldingly striving for the cause of the Party, and the friendship between the Han and Uyghur brothers, forged with blood.
    Zhao Bin and Meng Ying are a revolutionary couple and two revolutionary heroes. They embody the noble qualities of a revolutionary fighter and a Communist Party member. Zhao Bin is not portrayed much in the film, but the impression he leaves is very profound. The scene where he says goodbye to Meng Ying and is tied up and taken to the execution ground will never be forgotten. In this scene, from the actor's appearance to the expression of inner feelings, everything is very distinctive and very delicate. Seeing Zhao Bin's black, thick, and long beard, high cheekbones, and bright eyes, one immediately gets a feeling of strength, perseverance, unyieldingness, and indomitable spirit. He suppresses his inner emotions and says to Meng Ying, holding onto the iron railing, "Xiao Ying, my time has come!" How calm and unhurried! Meng Ying cried out "Bin!" and tears welled up in her eyes. Zhao Bin wiped the tears from Meng Ying's face and said deeply, "Xiao Ying, don't be like this. Death is not scary. What's scary is our weakness!" Well written, well acted! See, in just a few sentences, a spirit of "It doesn't matter to lose my head, as long as my belief is true" and "Wealth cannot corrupt me, force cannot subdue me" rushes towards every audience member.
    As a woman and a young revolutionary, Meng Ying cannot suppress her grief when saying goodbye to her lover, and tears flow like a spring, which is very natural. At the same time, she is stern and resolute towards the enemy. When the pseudo-police officer wants to drag the Uyghur girl Alamuhan, who is in the same cell, to be buried alive, she firmly opposes it and shouts loudly, "Stop!" At this time, she seems to be full of courage and strength. Especially Meng Ying, who has been tempered by more revolutionary struggles eighteen years later, is much stronger and more mature. She has a clear class stand in dealing with problems, handling affairs, and treating people. She demands of people according to the principles of the Party and according to the morality of a noble revolutionary. She is the same to herself. When Ali drives the bulldozer to climb Mount Moding, she realizes that Ali is her own son, lost for eighteen years. As a mother, how much she wants to rush over and hug her flesh and blood tightly in her arms! However, at that time, for the needs of the revolutionary work, she suppressed her emotions and did not do so. She knew that climbing the mountain was dangerous and could very likely cause this child, whom she had lost for eighteen years and only recently reunited with, to sacrifice himself in this battle without saying a word to his mother. However, she did not accept everyone's request to stop Ali from climbing the mountain, but resolutely closed the gate of her emotions and ordered, "Comrades, the task of climbing the slope will still be assigned to Ali!" This fully embodies the noble sentiment of a revolutionary who puts the public interest before his own and forgets himself for the sake of the public interest. In the end, she herself climbed onto the bulldozer and went with Ali to climb the slope. This stems from a mother's concern for her son, a leader's concern for young soldiers, and even more so from the true color of a Communist commander who "takes the lead." Such a drama, such a plot, and such a character make people feel so intimate, so touching, and so lovable!
    Shaping artistic images like Zhao Bin and Meng Ying and expressing the spiritual qualities of Zhao Bin and Meng Ying are precisely what is urgently needed to carry out communist education for our young generation. We need successors like Ali, and only by continuously carrying out the education of revolutionary traditions can we produce thousands upon thousands of successors like Ali. Our young people will be very familiar with Ali, because they can see their own shadows in him. He is truly a "little colt." Although he still has some shortcomings, he is not afraid of anything, as long as it is for the revolution and for the Party. He is young and pure, and is easily infected and educated by the revolutionary spirit of the older generation. After listening to Meng Ying's story of fighting in prison, he always remembers it in his heart, saying to everyone, "People were in such danger and difficulty at that time, but they still risked their lives to make revolution." But when he thinks of the present, he gets angry: "But what are we doing here? Digging and digging, we can't even get past this Mount Moding!" It was the spirit of the revolutionary predecessors, who did not care about life and death and were not afraid of hardship, that gave him encouragement and strength. Therefore, in order to find a way, he went up Mount Moding in heavy snow and fell into a snow pit. In order to open up Mount Moding, he was the first to request to drive the bulldozer up the slope, without avoiding difficulties and dangers.
    Through the fates of several specific characters, the film cleverly and truly links the fates of the Han and Uyghur brothers. And the basis of this connection of fate is none other than the revolutionary cause of the proletariat. In the past, they jointly opposed reactionary rule; now, they are jointly building socialism. In the film, the scenes where Meng Ying and Alamuhan depend on each other in prison, and where Grandpa Asim saves Ali, raises Ali, and prevents Ali from climbing the slope, are all very touching. As a film studio in an ethnic minority autonomous region, expressing ethnic friendship and promoting ethnic unity should be a major task of artistic creation.
    Of course, "Two Generations" also has its shortcomings, the structure is not complete enough, and the stitches are not fine enough. Like Wang Dong's counter-revolutionary activities and Maimaiti's right-leaning conservative thinking, they have not been more distinctly and deeply expressed, so the contradictions and conflicts on this line have not been developed enough, which has correspondingly affected the portrayal of positive characters such as Ali. But despite this, the merits outweigh the defects. A film like "Two Generations," which enthusiastically promotes the spirit of revolutionary tradition, reflects the great socialist construction, and praises ethnic friendship and unity, should be warmly applauded and congratulated.

    赤胆忠心两代人
    ——谈新疆电影制片厂拍摄的“两代人”
    谢逢松
    新疆电影制片厂拍摄的故事影片《两代人》，是一部好影片，它的成功是值得祝贺的。特别是作为兄弟民族地区一个年轻的电影制片厂的产儿，更值得为它的降生而欢呼。
    影片描写的是这样曲折动人的故事：一个名叫孟英的女共产党员，由北京调回到新疆兰新铁路的筑路工地上担任党委书记。她乘搭年轻的推土机手艾里驾驶的推土机前往工地时，看到沿途是一片热火朝天的建设景象，感慨万端；与此同时，她看见山丘上一个破碉楼，勾起了一段辛酸而沉痛的回忆：十八年前，她和她的爱人赵彬一起在新疆从事革命工作，一起被反动派盛世才逮捕入狱。他们的一个还不满周岁的孩子，也一同关在监牢里。不久，反动派杀害了她的丈夫赵彬，又想杀害她的孩子。在万分危急中，一个前来探监的维族老爷爷把孩子救了出去。十八年来，孟英为革命艰苦地战斗着，工作着，但一直不知道自己孩子的生死存亡。现在，她来到工地，又和前进道路上的新困难、新障碍斗争着，为党培养着像艾里这样的年轻一代。新事业在发展，新的人在成长，而她最后得知那个朝气蓬勃、敢想敢干的推土机手艾里，正是她失去了十八年的孩子；于是，母子重获团圆。
    一部艺术作品要想打动广大观众和读者的心弦，有一个曲折生动的故事是很重要的。但是，任何生动的故事、曲折的情节，只能是为它的主题思想服务的。《两代人》就是通过一个动人的故事，反映了两个完全不同的时代，两代革命者对党的事业赤胆忠心、不屈不挠地为之奋斗的精神，以及汉、维两个兄弟民族用鲜血凝成的友谊。
    赵彬和孟英，是一对革命夫妻，也是两个革命英雄。在他们身上，体现了作为一个革命战士、一个共产党员的高贵品质。赵彬在影片里着墨不多，但给人的印象是很深刻的。他嘱别孟英、绑赴刑场的那组镜头，会使人永久不能忘记。在这场戏里，从演员的外形到内在感情的表露，都是很有特色的，很细腻的。看到赵彬那又黑又粗又长的胡子，高高的颧骨，炯炯有光的眼睛，立刻给人一种坚强、刚毅、不屈不挠、顶天立地的感觉。他压制着内心的感情，扶着铁栏杆对孟英说：“小英，我的时候到了！”多么从容不迫！孟英高叫了一声“彬！”之后，眼泪夺眶而出。赵彬用手擦去孟英脸上的泪水，深沉地说：“小英，不要这样，死并不可怕，可怕的是我们的软弱！”写得好，演得也好！看，寥寥数句，一种“杀头不要紧，只要主义真”、“富贵不能淫、威武不能屈”的精神扑向每一个观众的面前来了。
    孟英作为一个妇女，作为一个年轻的革命者，在和自己的爱人永别的时候，抑制不住悲痛，泪如泉涌，那是很自然的，同时，她对敌人是横眉冷对的，坚决的。伪警官要拉同牢的维族姑娘阿拉木汗去活埋，她坚决反对，大声喝阻：“住手！”这时，她似乎一身都是胆，都是力量。特别是十八年以后，经过革命斗争更多的冶炼的孟英，就更坚强、更成熟得多了。她对待问题，处理问题，待人接物，都有一种鲜明的阶级立场。她对人都是按照党的原则来要求的，按照一个高尚的革命者的品德来要求的。她对自己呢？也是一样。艾里驾驶推土机爬莫顶山时，她才知道艾里是自己失去十八年的亲生儿子。作为一个母亲，她多么想立刻扑过去把这亲骨肉紧紧地搂在怀里啊！但是，她当时为了革命工作的需要，压制了自己的感情，没有这样做。她知道爬山是有危险的，很可能使这个失去十八年才重见的孩子没有同母亲说上一句话而牺牲在这场战斗里；但是，她没有接受大家的要求不让艾里去爬山，而是毅然关上自己感情的闸门，下令道：“同志们，爬坡的任务，还是交给艾里执行！”这里充分体现了一个革命者先公后私、公而忘私的高尚情操。最后，她自己也爬上推土机跟着艾里一起爬坡去了。这里，是出于一个母亲对儿子的关切，也是出于一个首长对年轻战士的关切，更是表现了一个共产党指挥员“身先士卒”的本色。这样的戏，这样的情节，这样的人物，使人觉得多么亲切，多么感人，多么可爱啊！
    塑造赵彬、孟英这样的艺术形象，表现赵彬、孟英这样的精神品质，正是对我们年轻一代进行共产主义教育所迫切需要的。我们需要像艾里那样的接班人，也只有不断地进行革命传统的教育，才能出现千千万万像艾里那样的接班人。我们的年轻人是会很熟悉艾里的，因为从他身上可以看到自己的影子。他真是一条“小马驹子”，尽管他身上还存在一些缺点，但是，只要是为了革命，为了党，他是天不怕地不怕的。他年轻纯洁，很容易受老一辈的革命精神的感染和教育。他听了孟英讲的在监牢里斗争的故事，就总是记在心里，逢人就说：“人家那时候多么危险，多么困难，还拼着性命干革命。”可是，一想到眼前，就气来了：“可我们在这里干什么？挖呀挖，就连这个莫顶山都过不去！”正是革命先辈们那种不计生死、不畏艰苦的精神，给了他鼓舞和力量。于是，他为了找路，大雪天上了莫顶山，并掉进雪坑里；为了打通莫顶山，他第一个要求驾驶推土机爬坡，不避艰险。
    影片通过几个具体人物的命运，把汉、维两个兄弟民族的命运巧妙地、真切地联结了起来。而这种命运相联的基础，不是别的，正是无产阶级的革命事业。过去，共同反对反动统治；现在，共同建设社会主义。在影片里，像孟英和阿拉木汗在监狱里相依为命，阿西姆老爷爷搭救艾里、抚育艾里、不让艾里爬坡等情节，都是很动人的。作为民族自治区的电影制片厂，表现民族友谊，宣传民族团结，应该是艺术创作的一大任务。
    当然，《两代人》也还有不足之处，结构上还不够完整，针线还不够细密。像王冬的反革命活动，买买提的右倾保守思想，都还未能更有分别地、更深刻地加以表现，因此，在这条线上的矛盾冲突就开展得不够，相应地影响了对艾里这样一些正面人物的刻划。但是，尽管是这样，还是瑕不掩瑜，像《两代人》这样热情地宣扬革命传统精神，反映社会主义伟大建设，歌颂民族友谊和团结的影片，是应该热烈地向它鼓掌欢迎，向它拍手祝贺的。（附图片）
