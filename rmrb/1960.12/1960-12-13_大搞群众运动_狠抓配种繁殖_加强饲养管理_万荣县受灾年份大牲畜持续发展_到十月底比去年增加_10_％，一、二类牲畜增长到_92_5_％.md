    Launch Mass Movements, Vigorously Grasp Breeding and Reproduction, Strengthen Feeding Management
    Wanrong County Achieves Sustained Development of Large Livestock Despite Disaster Years
    By the end of October, the number of livestock increased by 10% compared to last year, and first and second-class livestock increased to 92.5%.
    (Our report) Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, located in the Loess Plateau, achieved a large-scale development of large livestock despite insufficient water sources, a shortage of pasture, and a severe drought this year. By the end of October, the total number of cattle, donkeys, mules, and horses in the county reached 42,020 head, and one-quarter of the management districts had achieved an average of one animal per household. The total number of livestock has increased by more than double since 1949; and by more than 10% compared to 1959. The condition of the livestock has generally improved, and the number of well-fed, strong first and second-class livestock has increased from 86.7% of the total number of livestock last year to 92.5%.
    The reason why Wanrong County's large livestock can develop quickly and be well-fed is primarily due to adhering to putting politics in command and launching mass movements. Based on the county's situation, the county party committee listed the development of large livestock as one of the main production tasks for the year, greatly strengthening leadership. Each commune and management district was equipped with a full-time secretary and director, and production teams were equipped with deputy captains, establishing livestock work organizations from top to bottom. In order to closely cooperate with agriculture, commerce, grain, banking, and other departments, and to absorb the participation of responsible persons from relevant units, livestock guidance committees were organized at all levels. The county dispatched more than 1,100 party members and cadres to serve as feeders and inseminators. At the same time, the county conducted in-depth research in key areas, examining the experiences and lessons of eight high-yield areas such as Xiaotao and Zhengcun, and four low-yield areas, using vivid examples of mutual support between agriculture and animal husbandry to conduct extensive propaganda and education among the people of the county, criticizing and overcoming the ideas of some cadres and masses who were waiting for mechanization, thereby launching a mass movement to develop large livestock.
    Grasping breeding and reproduction, and striving for "five complets" (complete breeding, complete pregnancy, complete birth, complete survival, and complete growth) is the key to the high-speed development of large livestock. In this work, in addition to giving full play to the role of the county's 108 breeding farms, stations, points, and professional teams, it also made full use of the superior conditions of the people's communes, which can uniformly arrange and rationally allocate livestock breeding and reproduction, to launch mass livestock breeding activities. A responsibility system was implemented: the county was responsible for the commune, the commune was responsible for the management district, the district was responsible for the production team, and the team was responsible for the stall, the feeder was responsible for the livestock; the inseminator was responsible for complete breeding and pregnancy, the worker was responsible for using the livestock at the appropriate age and ensuring safe pregnancy, and the feeder was responsible for complete birth, complete survival, and complete growth.
    In the management of livestock feeding and use, Wanrong County summarized and promoted the effective experiences of the masses in various places over the years. The county universally implemented ten determinations (determine feeders, determine feed and forage, determine breeding tasks, determine fat standards, determine agricultural machinery matching, determine feeding remuneration, determine reward and punishment methods, determine work norms and workers, determine manure accumulation, and determine expense payment methods); the production team implemented "six rights delegation" for feeders (the right to inspect upon return from work; the right to intervene in excessive labor; the right to refuse to accept coarse grass and feed; the right to stop and criticize random pulling of livestock; the right to adjust rest for pregnant animals in heat; and the right to adjust management and stop using livestock with illness). Therefore, management has been greatly improved.
    Forage and feed are the material foundation for developing livestock. In solving the forage problem, the county, based on the spirit of establishing bases and opening up broad sources of grass, used barren ditches and slopes, and roadsides to plant a total of 111,000 mu of alfalfa; used the vigorous growth of summer and autumn wild grass season, organized a blitz grass-cutting movement, stored sufficient forage, and adopted methods to save forage and improve forage utilization.
    In leading livestock production, Wanrong County established many models and carried out a learn-from-and-surpass movement, mobilizing the enthusiasm of cadres and commune members to develop and breed livestock. The county carried out a learn-from-and-surpass competition movement through methods such as holding on-site meetings and mutual visits. During the movement, many advanced collectives and various model pacesetters emerged successively. In order to encourage advanced individuals and establish the professional ideology of feeders and inseminators, the county implemented reward systems such as breeding rewards, reproduction rewards, weight-gain rewards, healthcare rewards, and seniority awards.
    According to the county's experience, regular inspection and evaluation is an important measure to break through weak links, ensure the completion of tasks, and implement systems. In the first ten months of this year, based on the different characteristics of livestock work in various periods, they organized a total of four county-wide general inspections and cross-inspections. Through inspections, ideological and practical problems in the development of livestock work were discovered and resolved in a timely manner.

    大搞群众运动　狠抓配种繁殖　加强饲养管理
    万荣县受灾年份大牲畜持续发展
    到十月底比去年增加10％，一、二类牲畜增长到92.5％
    本报讯　地处黄土高原的山西省万荣县，在水源不足，牧草缺少，今年又遭受严重旱灾的情况下，大牲畜获得了大范围的发展。至10月底，全县牛、驴、骡、马总头数已达四万二千零二十头，有四分之一的管理区已实现一户平均一畜。牲畜总头数比1949年增长了一倍多；比1959年增长了十分之一以上。牲畜膘度普遍增加，膘肥体壮的一、二类牲畜由去年占牲畜总头数的86.7％，增加到92.5％。
    万荣县大牲畜能够发展的快、喂的好，首先是由于坚持了政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。县委根据本县情况，把发展大牲畜列为全年主要生产任务之一，大大加强了领导。各公社和管理区都配备了专职书记和主任，生产队配备了副队长，自上而下地建立了畜牧工作机构。为了与农业、商业、粮食、银行等部门密切协作，并吸收有关单位负责人参加，层层组织了牲畜指导委员会。全县派遣了一千一百多名党团员干部充当饲养员和配种员。同时全县通过深入重点，考察研究了小桃、郑村等八个高产地区和四个低产地区的经验教训，运用农牧业互相支援的生动事例，向全县人民进行了广泛的宣传教育，批判与克服了一些干部、群众存在的等待机械化的思想，从而掀起了群众性的发展大牲畜运动。
    抓住配种繁殖，力争“五全”（全配、全怀、全生、全活、全壮）是大牲畜高速度发展的关键。在这项工作中，除充分发挥了全县一百零八个配种场、站、点、专业队伍的作用外，还充分运用人民公社化后能够统一安排，合理调剂牲畜配种繁殖的优越条件，大搞群众性的牲畜配种活动。并且实行了县包公社，社包管理区，区包生产队，队包槽，饲养员包牲口；配种员保全配、全怀，使役人员保使役适龄、怀胎安全，饲养员保全生、全活、全壮的责任制度。
    万荣县在牲畜的饲养、使役等经营管理上，总结和推广了各地群众多年来行之有效的经验。全县普遍实行了十定（定饲养人员、定饲料饲草、定繁殖任务、定膘肥标准、定农具配套、定饲养报酬、定奖惩办法、定使役定额和使役人员、定积肥数量、定费用开支办法）；生产队对饲养员实行了“六权下放”（使役回来有检查权；劳役过度有干涉权；草长料粗有拒绝接受权；乱拉牲畜有阻止批评权；母畜发情有调整休息权；牲畜有病有调整管理和停止使用权）。因而大大改善了经营管理。
    饲草、饲料是发展牲畜的物质基础。在解决饲草问题上，这个县本着建立基地、广开草源的精神，利用荒沟野坡、地边路旁共种苜蓿十一万一千亩；利用夏、秋野草旺盛季节，组织突击打草运动，打贮了足够的饲草，并采用了节约饲草方法，提高饲草利用率。
    万荣县在领导畜牧业生产中，广树标兵，开展了学赶帮超运动，调动了广大干部和社员发展繁殖牲畜的积极性。全县通过开现场会，互相参观等办法，开展了学赶帮超竞赛运动。运动中，先后涌现出许多先进集体和各种模范标兵。为了鼓励先进，树立饲养员、配种员的专业思想，全县实行了配种奖、繁殖奖、增膘奖、保健奖和工龄奖等奖励制度。
    根据这个县的经验，定期检查评比，是突破薄弱环节保证任务完成和制度贯彻执行的重要措施。他们在今年头十个月，根据各个时期牲畜工作不同的特点，共组织过四次全县性的普遍检查和交叉大检查。通过检查，及时发现与解决了发展牲畜工作中的思想问题和实际问题。
