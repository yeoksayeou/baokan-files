Xinhua News Agency, December 14th: The Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Women's Federation issued a joint statement today, protesting the atrocities of the French imperialists in massacring the Algerian people.

The statement pointed out that the Algerian people, who are growing stronger and more united in struggle, cannot be conquered by any imperialist forces. The 650 million Chinese people have always firmly supported the Algerian people's national liberation war and firmly believe that, with the support of the unprecedentedly powerful forces of the Asian, African, and worldwide people, the Algerian people who persist in struggle will surely achieve the final victory in the cause of national liberation.

The full text of the joint statement of the people's organizations is as follows:

    Just as the head of French colonialism, de Gaulle, is carrying out conspiratorial activities in Algeria, the French aggressor troops are carrying out large-scale massacres and bloody suppression against the patriotic Algerian people who are striving for independence and freedom in Algeria and other cities. This monstrous crime has aroused great anger among the Asian, African, and peace-loving people of the world. The Chinese people fully support Premier Zhou Enlai's reply to Premier Abbas Ferhat of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria on December 13, expressing their utmost indignation and strongest protest against the bloody atrocities of the French colonialists.

    The flames of resistance ignited in Algiers and other cities once again demonstrate the great will of the heroic Algerian people to fight for national independence and their firm determination to defeat imperialism. The 650 million Chinese people have always firmly supported the Algerian people's national liberation war and express brotherly sympathy and the highest respect to the hard-struggling Algerian people. Although the French colonialists, with the support of US imperialism and the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, are intensifying their brutal military suppression and various political deceptions against the Algerian people in order to maintain their precarious colonial rule, the Algerian people, who are growing stronger and more united in struggle, cannot be conquered by any imperialist forces. The blood of the patriotic Algerian people will never be shed in vain. The Chinese people firmly believe that, with the support of the unprecedentedly powerful forces of the Asian, African, and worldwide people, the Algerian people who persist in struggle will surely achieve the final victory in the cause of national liberation.

    我亚非团结委员会等团体支持阿尔及利亚人民
    抗议法国屠杀阿尔及利亚人民的暴行
    据新华社14日讯　中国亚非团结委员会、中国非洲人民友好协会、中华全国总工会、中华全国青年联合会、中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会今天发表联合声明，抗议法帝国主义者屠杀阿尔及利亚人民的暴行。
    声明指出，在斗争中日益壮大和团结的阿尔及利亚人民，是任何帝国主义势力所不能征服的。六亿五千万中国人民一贯坚决支持阿尔及利亚人民所进行的民族解放战争，并且深信，在空前壮大的亚非和全世界人民力量的支援下，坚持斗争的阿尔及利亚人民一定能够获得民族解放事业的最后胜利。
    各人民团体联合声明的全文如下：
    正当法国殖民主义头子戴高乐在阿尔及利亚进行阴谋活动的时候，法国侵略军在阿尔及利亚和其它城市，对争取独立自由的阿尔及利亚爱国人民进行大规模的屠杀和血腥镇压。这一滔天罪行激起了亚非人民和全世界爱好和平人民的极大愤怒。中国人民完全拥护我国政府周恩来总理于12月13日致阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府阿巴斯·费尔哈特总理的复电，对法国殖民主义者的血腥暴行，表示无比的愤慨和最强烈的抗议。
    阿尔及尔及其它城市所燃起的反抗的怒火，再一次表现了英勇的阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的伟大意志与战胜帝国主义的坚强决心。六亿五千万中国人民一贯坚决支持阿尔及利亚人民所进行的民族解放战争，对坚苦奋斗的阿尔及利亚人民表示兄弟的同情和最崇高的敬意。尽管法国殖民主义者在美帝国主义和北大西洋侵略集团的支持下，加紧对阿尔及利亚人民进行残酷的军事镇压和各种政治欺骗，以便维持其摇摇欲坠的殖民统治，但是，在斗争中日益壮大和团结的阿尔及利亚人民，是任何帝国主义势力所不能征服的。阿尔及利亚爱国人民的鲜血决不会白流。中国人民深信，在空前壮大的亚非和全世界人民力量的支援下，坚持斗争的阿尔及利亚人民，一定能够获得民族解放事业的最后胜利。
