    Excellent Meteorologist - Wang Xiru
    Collectively written by Shenyang Daily reporters and correspondents
    Wang Xiru is a 21-year-old member of the Communist Youth League. After graduating from senior primary school in 1954, he responded to the Party's call to participate in agricultural production. In the vast expanse of the countryside, he established ambitious goals, learned from the masses, and worked diligently, becoming an excellent meteorologist and was honorably评 as a labor model of the county, city, and province.
    Listening to the Party's Words, Rooting in the Countryside
    Wang Xiru was only sixteen years old when he came to Sanjiangkou, Liaoning Province. He came with the Northeast Reclamation Corps in response to the Party's call. In the harsh winter, the Sanjiangkou area was freezing cold. After several heavy snowfalls, the houses were covered with an inch-thick layer of frost. Thousands of people who came to participate in reclamation stood in the icy and snowy wasteland all day long, digging up tree stumps and burning grass to clear the land, declaring war on more than two thousand hectares of wasteland, demanding grain from more than two thousand hectares of wasteland.
    The task of fighting against nature was arduous; it was truly like a scorching furnace, testing people's confidence and will. Shortly after Wang Xiru came to Sanjiangkou, some relatives and classmates in Beijing and Dalian sent him many letters, hoping that he would go to work in the city. What to do? Wang Xiru was at a loss for a while. One day, he told Zhao Xizhi, the secretary of the Youth League branch, about his thoughts. Zhao Xizhi said to Wang Xiru: "A young person must have lofty ideals, and the farther the ideal, the stronger the determination to overcome difficulties. If everyone is afraid of difficulties, who will build a new countryside?" Zhao Xizhi's words touched Wang Xiru's heart. He thought about it over and over again for several days and finally understood: "I am the son of a poor peasant, and no one in my family has ever been educated for generations. Before liberation, my family had no house or land, and I followed my father to beg for food from the age of four or five. Now I have a little education, and isn't it all thanks to the Party's cultivation? I should listen to the Party's words, and wherever the Party needs me, I should be there! Besides, if no one engages in agriculture, where will food and clothing come from?" Therefore, he expressed to the Party: "I will definitely listen to the Party's words and am determined to take root in the countryside and transform the nature of Sanjiangkou!"
    Conquering "Wind Granny" and Locking Up "Thunder God"
    Sanjiangkou is a sandy丘 area with a lot of water and wind, and various natural disasters, especially floods and insect pests, seriously threaten agricultural production and the lives of the people. Before liberation, the average yield per mu here was only about eighty jin. Therefore, overcoming various natural disasters and increasing agricultural output has become the hope of the broad masses for generations.
    According to production needs, the Sanjiangkou Commune Party Committee established a weather service station in the second half of 1958 and decided to let Wang Xiru be the meteorologist.
    August and September are the rainy season in Sanjiangkou. Wang Xiru started his meteorological observation work at this time. Due to lack of experience, he initially only forwarded the weather forecasts of Liaoning and Jilin. After issuing more than twenty forecasts in a row, they all failed. The weather seemed to be deliberately playing tricks on him. Sometimes he forecast that it would rain the next morning, but there wasn't even a wisp of cloud; sometimes he forecast that a northwest wind would blow tomorrow, but the next day it would blow a southeast wind. In those days, Wang Xiru's heart had never been calm. One day, he went to Party Secretary Wang and said, "Meteorology is a science. I have no experience myself, and my education level is not high. Won't this delay things?" Secretary Wang talked to him a lot and finally told him: "Conquering nature is not a simple matter. You must have firm confidence and unyielding perseverance!" After Wang Xiru heard Secretary Wang's words, his heart felt like several windows had been opened, and he felt particularly bright. After a period of work practice, he explored the experience of combining "weather forecast, mass experience, historical data, and real-time observation," and the accuracy of his forecasts improved with each one. From then on, Wang Xiru understood more deeply: As long as you listen to the Party's words and establish ambitious goals, you can conquer "Wind Granny" and lock up "Thunder God"!
    Learning from Old Farmers and Constantly Improving Skills
    In Wang Xiru's small weather outpost, there are loaches, clams, small turtles, pine cones..., all kinds of animals and plants used to observe the weather. These are all set up according to the experience provided by local old farmers. Whether it is day or night, as long as he has the opportunity, he goes to production brigades or nursing homes to visit old farmers. He treasures the weather proverbs that the old farmers tell him and writes them down in his notebook. Then, he refers to these proverbs and compares them with the reflections of his own manufactured indigenous instruments to revise the weather forecasts of Liaoning Province, Siping, Jilin and other places adjacent to Sanjiangkou. On the afternoon of April 20 last year, according to the proverb of the old man in the nursing home, "cold wind, hot snow," he issued a heavy snow forecast to all nineteen production brigades in the commune. At the time, some people didn't believe it, but it really snowed heavily the next day.
    Another time, there was a heavy rain of more than seventy millimeters in the Sanjiangkou area. Before the heavy rain, he made a forecast based on the proverb of Fu Yuting, an old man in his sixties, "Ants pile up and snakes coil." The commune members of the Daming Tun team of the Gao'er Brigade, according to the forecast, moved more than twenty large livestock from the dilapidated stables. When the stables collapsed due to the rain, the livestock were not injured at all. These facts made Wang Xiru feel more and more the importance of accurate weather forecasts for ensuring a bumper harvest in agriculture. People saw that Wang Xiru's forecasts were accurate and called him the "Red Scholar" of the countryside.
    Red in the Countryside, Specialized in the Countryside
    This year in February, Wang Xiru participated in the Liaoning Provincial Agricultural Heroes Meeting and returned with even greater enthusiasm. He firmly remembered the instructions of Secretary Huang Oudong of the Provincial Party Committee and was determined to be red in the countryside and specialized in the countryside, bravely overcoming all difficulties and dedicating his youth to the construction of the socialist countryside. Due to his painstaking research, he has now explored a set of laws as the focus of his work throughout the year. In Wang Xiru's work summary, it is written: Spring focuses on the last frost and sowing, drought weather and strong winds; Summer focuses on rainfall and flood control, disaster weather and pests; Autumn focuses on the first frost day, forecasting the crop maturity period; Winter focuses on cold waves and snow, serving water conservancy and accumulating fertilizer. According to these practices, Wang Xiru has achieved an accuracy rate of over 96% in weather forecasts and an accuracy rate of 100% in hazardous weather forecasts.

    优秀的气象员——王锡儒
    沈阳日报记者和通讯员集体采写
    王锡儒，是个二十一岁的共青团员。他1954年高小毕业后，响应党的号召参加了农业生产。在农村这个广阔的天地里，他树立了雄心大志，拜群众为师，踏踏实实埋头苦干，成为一个优秀的气象员，被光荣地评为县、市、省的劳动模范。
    听党的话　在农村扎根
    王锡儒来到辽宁省三江口那年，才十六岁。他是响应党的号召，随着东北开荒团来的。严寒的冬季，三江口这个地方滴水成冰。几场大雪之后，屋子里铺上了一寸来厚的霜。数千名来参加开荒的人们，整天站在冰雪的荒地里刨树疙瘩、打草烧荒，向着两千多垧荒地宣战，向着两千多垧荒地要粮。
    向自然进行斗争的任务是艰巨的，它真像一座灼热的熔炉，考验着人们的信心和意志。就在王锡儒来三江口不久的时候，王锡儒住在北京、大连的一些亲戚、同学们，给他寄来了许多信，希望他到城市去工作。何去何从？王锡儒一时没有了主意。一天，他把自己的想法，都和团支部书记赵希志说了。赵希志对王锡儒说：“一个青年要有远大的理想，理想越远大战胜困难的决心就越坚强。要是都怕困难，谁来建设新农村呢？……”赵希志同志的话，句句都打动着王锡儒的心。他一连几天翻来复去地寻思，终于想通了：“我是个贫农的儿子，家里祖祖辈辈也没有一个读书人。解放前，家里房无一间，地无一垅，从四、五岁就跟着爸爸讨饭吃。如今我有了一点文化，还不是党培养出来的。应当听党的话，党需要自己在哪，自己就应当在哪！再说，没有人干农业，吃饭穿衣从哪来？”于是，他向党表示：“一定听党的话，决心在农村扎根，改造三江口的大自然！”
    战胜“风婆”锁住“雷公”
    三江口，是个多水多风的沙丘地带，各种自然灾害尤其是水灾、虫灾，严重地威胁着农业生产和群众生活。解放前，这里每亩平均产量只有八十斤左右。因此，战胜各种自然灾害，提高农业产量，便成了广大群众祖祖辈辈的希望。
    三江口公社党委根据生产需要，于1958年下半年办起了气象服务站，并决定让王锡儒做气象员。
    8、9月的三江口，是个多雨季节。王锡儒开始气象观测工作，正是在这个时候。由于缺乏经验，开始他只是照转辽宁和吉林的气象预报。一连发了二十多次预报，都失败了。老天爷好像故意和他作对似的，有时他预报第二天上午有雨，到时候却连一丝云彩都没有；有时他预报明天要刮西北风，可第二天偏偏刮的是东南风，……。那些天，王锡儒的心一直没有平静过。一天，他找党委王书记说：“气象是一门科学，我自己没经验，文化水平也不高，这样下去不要耽误事吗？”王书记和他谈了很多，最后告诉他：“征服大自然不是一件简单的事，一定要坚定信心，要有百折不挠的毅力！”王锡儒听了王书记这番话，心里就像打开几扇窗户似的，特别敞亮。经过一个时期的工作实践，他摸索出“天气预报、群众经验、历史资料、实况观测”四结合的经验，预报一次比一次准确。从此，王锡儒更加深刻地懂得：只要听党的话，树立雄心大志，就能战胜“风婆”，锁住“雷公”！
    请教老农不断提高本领
    在王锡儒的小小气象哨里，有泥鳅、蛤螺、小乌龟、松树塔……，各式各样用来观测天气的动物和植物，这些都是根据当地老农提供的经验设置的。不管是白天、晚上，他只要有机会，就去生产大队或敬老院访问老农。老农告诉他的气象谚语，他都如获珍宝一样记在笔记本上，然后参考这些谚语，对照自己制造的土仪器的反映，去订正与三江口相接的辽宁省、四平、吉林等地的气象预报。去年4月20日下午，他根据敬老院老人“冷风热雪”的农谚，向全公社十九个生产大队发出了大雪的预报。当时有人不大相信，可是第二天果真下了一场大雪。
    还有一次，三江口一带下了一场七十多毫米的大雨。大雨以前，他根据六十多岁的老人傅玉廷说的“蚂蚁成堆蛇盘道”的农谚做了预报。高尔大队大明屯小队的社员，根据预报，把二十多头大牲畜从多年失修的马棚牵走，当马棚遭雨倒塌时，牲畜没受丝毫损伤。这些事实，使王锡儒更加感到准确的气象预报，对保证农业大丰收的重要关系。人们看到王锡儒预报准确，都称他为农村的“红秀才”。
    红在农村专在农村
    今年2月，王锡儒参加辽宁省农业群英会回来，精神更加焕发。他牢牢地记着省委黄欧东书记的指示，决心红在农村专在农村，勇敢地克服一切困难，把青春献给社会主义农村的建设事业。由于他苦心钻研，现在已摸索出一套规律，作为一年四季的工作重点。在王锡儒的工作总结中这样写着：春抓终霜和播种，干旱天气和大风；夏季降雨和防汛，灾害天气和病虫；秋抓初霜日，预报作物成熟期；冬抓寒潮和雪天，服务水利和积肥。王锡儒按照这些做法，使天气预报的准确率达96％以上，灾害性天气预报的准确率达到100％。
