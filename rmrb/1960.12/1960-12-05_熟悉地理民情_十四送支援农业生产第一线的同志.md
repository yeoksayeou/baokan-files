    Familiarizing Oneself with Geography and Local Conditions
    – Sending Off the Fourteenth Group of Comrades to Support the Agricultural Production Front Lines
    Ge Song
    In some feature stories, we often read about old farmers and local residents leading cadres to explore water sources and find mineral deposits. They can find trickling water or valuable iron ore and rare metals in places that were historically considered to have no water or minerals. People are so familiar with their land that they can even discern treasures buried deep beneath it. As for what kind of land should grow what crops, how to plant them, and how to manage them, they know it like the back of their hand.
    In the countryside, we can also often hear cadres talking about the history of a certain family, the characteristics of a certain person, their personality, what kind of work they are good at, and what kind of skills they excel in. They really know it like the back of their hand. Some even know which day a certain child was born, and how many chickens and hens of what color a certain family has. They are even more clear about the local class situation.
    These local cadres, born, raised, and working here, are very familiar with the local geography and local conditions. This is a kind of profound knowledge that is not found in books, and it is a valuable asset.
    Comrades who go to the front lines of agricultural production are far less familiar with this than they are. Some of the comrades who go to the front lines of agricultural production have never worked in rural areas; others, although they have stayed in rural areas in the past, find that the current rural areas are very different from the past. A brand-new rural work is placed before us, forcing us to learn everything from scratch and to become familiar with everything from scratch.
    "Some things that we are familiar with are about to be put aside, and some things that we are not familiar with are forcing us to do." ("On the People's Democratic Dictatorship") For example, how to get from one place to another in the city by taking which bus, and which streets and alleys to pass through to get to a certain place, are temporarily not needed. What needs to be quickly familiarized with is: Where are the hills? Where is the farmland? How high are the mountains? How deep is the water? What kind of soil is what kind of land? What kind of land is suitable for growing what crops? What crops should be arranged for what stubble? What are the climate patterns? If it is a disaster area, what is the historical disaster situation? How large is the area affected by the disaster this year? … We must understand these things seriously and carefully in order to know ourselves and the enemy, adapt to local conditions, and then transform mountains and rivers, improve the soil, turn dry land into paddy fields, turn bad land into fertile land, and make the mountains green and everywhere green.
    However, this is only a part: geography. There is another part: local conditions. Everything has to be done through people, and relationships between people will occur. This requires getting to know people. We need to understand the county, the commune, the brigade, the team, and also every family. What was this place like before liberation? What is it like after liberation? What were the class relations in the past and what is the current class situation? What are the ideological conditions of cadres and commune members? What sufferings did the commune members suffer before liberation? What are their current demands? What difficulties do they have? How do the commune members support good cadres? What opinions do they have about the few cadres who are not good enough? What are the demands of the elderly? What are the demands of women? What are the demands of young people and children? And so on. To be familiar with these things, we must first be determined to become one with the local people, to be as close as fish and water, and to be able to work in the masses and lead the masses forward.
    There is a Chinese saying: "When entering a country, ask about its customs." To understand the local geography and local conditions, we must "ask about its customs," and after "asking about its customs," we must further transform the local agricultural production conditions together with the commune members.
    Some backward farming techniques and habits need to be changed, and many new measures that are suitable for the local conditions need to be promoted, and the mountains and rivers must be changed accordingly. Our familiarity with the local geography and local conditions is precisely to prepare conditions for the transformation. Familiarity with geography and familiarity with local conditions will facilitate work and facilitate the rapid change of the poor and blank situation.
    In his article "Establishing Consolidated Northeastern Base Areas," written fifteen years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us: "We must repeatedly educate all outside cadres, pay attention to investigation and research, and become familiar with local geography and local conditions." Comrade Mao Zedong believed that this was an important task for establishing consolidated northeastern base areas. Now, the comrades who go to the front lines of agricultural production, "when they arrive in a place, they must unite with the people there and take root and blossom among the people." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume IV, page 1161) To take root and blossom, familiarity with geography and local conditions is the first step.

    熟悉地理民情
    ——十四送支援农业生产第一线的同志
    戈松
    在一些通讯特写里，我们常读到一些老农和当地居民带领干部探索水源、寻找矿苗的故事。他们能在历来认为没有水、没有矿的地方，找到潺潺的流水或宝贵的铁矿和稀有金属。人们就是这样熟悉自己的土地，甚至洞察到深埋在土地下面的宝藏，至于什么样的土地该种什么庄稼，怎么种，怎么管，那就更是如数家珍了。
    在农村里，我们也可以经常听到干部讲某家的历史，某人的特点，性格，能干什么活，擅长什么手艺，真是如数家常，有的连哪个小孩是哪天生的，谁家有几只什么颜色的公鸡母鸡，都说得出。当地阶级状况，他们更是一清二楚。
    这些本地干部，生于斯、长于斯、工作于斯，他们非常熟悉当地的地理民情，这是一种书本上没有的大学问，是一份珍贵的财富。
    到农业生产第一线去的同志，在这方面是远不如他们的。到农业生产第一线去的同志，有的是从来没有在农村工作过；有的虽然过去呆过农村，可是现在的农村已经早跟过去大不一样。崭新的农村工作摆在我们面前，强迫我们一切都要从头学起，从头熟悉起来。
    “我们熟习的东西有些快要闲起来了，我们不熟习的东西正在强迫我们去做。”（《论人民民主专政》）比如在城市里从哪儿到哪儿乘几路公共车辆，到什么地方经过哪几条大街小巷，都暂时用不到了。需要很快熟悉的是：哪儿是丘陵？何处是耕地？山有多高？水有多深？什么地是什么土质？什么地适合种什么庄稼？什么茬口安排什么作物？气候的规律怎么样？如果是灾区，历年的灾情如何？今年受灾的面积多大？……一定要认认真真、仔仔细细地了解了这些，才能知己知彼，因地制宜，进而改造山河，改良土壤，使旱地改水田，孬地变沃壤，满山皆青，无处不绿。
    然而，这还只是一部分：地理。还有另一部分：民情。一切事情都要通过人去干的，要发生人和人的关系。这就要熟悉人。要了解县、公社、大队、小队，还要了解每个家庭。这个地方解放前怎么样？解放后怎么样？过去的阶级关系和现在的阶级状况怎么样？干部和社员有哪些思想情况？社员群众解放前受过哪些苦？现在有些什么要求？有些什么困难？社员对好的干部是怎样拥护的？对少数不够好的干部又有哪些意见？老年人有什么要求？妇女有什么要求？青年和少年儿童又有什么要求？等等。要熟悉这些，就要首先下决心和当地人民打成一片，水乳交融，并且要做到既在群众中干，又能带着群众走。
    我国有句话：“入境问俗”。了解当地地理民情就要做到“入境问俗”，“问俗”之后，还要进一步同公社社员一起变革当地的农业生产条件。
    有些落后的耕作技术习惯要改变，有很多新的又适合当地情况的措施需要推广，山河也要为之变色。我们熟悉当地的地理民情正是为变革准备条件。熟悉了地理，又熟悉了民情，这才能便于工作，便于迅速改变一穷二白的面貌。
    毛泽东同志在十五年前写的《建立巩固的东北根据地》一文中曾指示我们：“必须反复教育一切外来干部，注重调查研究，熟悉地理民情”。毛泽东同志认为这是建立巩固的东北根据地的重要任务。现在到农业生产第一线去的同志，“到了一个地方，就要同那里的人民结合起来，在人民中间生根、开花。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷第1161页）要生根，要开花，熟悉地理民情是第一步。
