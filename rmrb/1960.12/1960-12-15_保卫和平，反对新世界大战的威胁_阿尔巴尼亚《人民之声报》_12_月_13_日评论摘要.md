Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, December 13th - The Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published a commentary on December 13th regarding the appeal to the people of the world issued by the representatives of the communist and workers' parties of all countries. The commentary was titled "Defend Peace, Oppose the Threat of a New World War."

The commentary stated that the appeal to the people of the world by the representatives of communist and workers' parties from five continents is a great historical document inspired by lofty communist ideals, a sense of responsibility for the fate of humanity, and socialist humanism.

The commentary stated that communists are the most determined and tenacious fighters for peace and for ensuring the people's right to labor and a secure life. Socialist countries have established the Leninist principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems as the basis of their foreign policy. No socialist country, the entire communist movement, or Marxism-Leninism has ever proposed resolving the historical antagonism between capitalism and socialism through a world war, let alone a nuclear war. The Soviet Union, People's China, and other socialist countries, as well as all peace-loving people around the world, are making every effort to defend peace and prevent war. However, the governments of imperialist countries, primarily the United States government, are pursuing a blatant policy of aggression. Imperialism has been and remains the organizer of aggressive wars. The nature of imperialism has not changed. It is the governments of Western powers that have rejected the constructive proposals and initiatives of the Soviet Union, which have been supported by hundreds of millions of people around the world, regarding the defense of peace. After exposing the facts of the imperialist countries, led by the United States, opposing disarmament and clamoring for nuclear weapons testing, the commentary stated that the establishment of aggressive military blocs such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the establishment of military bases by the United States in foreign countries, the revival of German militarism and the equipping of the West German armed forces with weapons of mass destruction, the revival of Japanese militarism and the occupation of South Korea, the Chinese territory of Taiwan, and the violation of People's China's rights in the United Nations, the dispatch of military aircraft to intrude into the airspace of the Soviet Union and other sovereign countries, and the organization of espionage networks in foreign countries, etc., all clearly demonstrate the aggressive policy of U.S. imperialism.

The commentary stated that war is not inevitable, and war can be prevented. Currently, this possibility of preventing war is real. The current balance of world forces is favorable to socialism because today there are powerful factors in action that do not allow imperialism to do as it pleases: the socialist system, which accounts for more than one-third of humanity, the international workers' movement, the millions of people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, neutral countries, and the broad peace movement. As stated in the appeal to the people of the world, "All these peace-loving forces, united in resolute struggle, can shatter the sinister plans for war, defend peace, and consolidate friendship among them." The commentary continued: "Today, more than ever, it is necessary to raise and strengthen vigilance against the conspiracies and aggressive plans of imperialism. A persistent struggle must be waged today against these conspiracies and tricks to defend peace."

The commentary concluded by saying: The Albanian communists and the Albanian people fully agree with and unreservedly support the historic appeal to the people of the world issued by the representatives of the communist and workers' parties of all countries to defend peace. The Albanian government and people, under the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist party, will, as in the past, spare no effort to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp (which is the main guarantee for defending world peace), to defend peace and the security of all peoples, will do their utmost to expose the aggressive plans of imperialism and its servants, the modern revisionists, especially the Yugoslav revisionists, and will raise revolutionary vigilance, tirelessly strive, and contribute all their strength to realizing the aspirations of the people of the world and defending world peace.

    保卫和平，反对新世界大战的威胁
    阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》12月13日评论摘要
    新华社地拉那13日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》13日就各国共产党和工人党代表会议的告世界人民书发表了一篇评论，评论的题目是《保卫和平，反对新世界大战的威胁》。
    评论说，五大洲共产党和工人党代表的告世界人民书，是在崇高的共产主义思想、对人类命运的责任感和社会主义人道主义鼓舞下的一个伟大的历史性文件。
    评论说，共产党人是争取和平、争取人民得到劳动和生活保障的最坚决和最顽强的战士。社会主义各国已确定列宁主义的、不同社会制度国家间和平共处的原则为自己对外政策的基础。任何一个社会主义国家、整个共产主义运动、马克思列宁主义都从来没有提出过以世界大战，更不用说以原子战争，来解决资本主义和社会主义之间的历史性的对立。苏联、人民中国和其他社会主义国家，以及全世界一切爱好和平的人们，都全力以赴地为保卫和平、制止战争而斗争，但帝国主义国家政府，首先是美国政府，却奉行着明目张胆的侵略政策。帝国主义无论在过去和现在都是侵略战争的组织者。帝国主义的本性并没有改变。正是西方大国政府拒绝了苏联提出的、得到全世界亿万人支持的关于保卫和平的建设性建议和倡议。评论在揭露以美国为首的帝国主义国家反对裁军和叫嚣进行核武器试验的事实以后说，北大西洋公约组织、东南亚条约组织等侵略性军事集团的建立、美国在外国建立军事基地、复活德国军国主义和以大规模毁灭性武器装备西德国防军、复活日本军国主义和占领南朝鲜、中国领土台湾和侵犯人民中国在联合国的权利、派遣军用飞机侵入苏联和其他主权国家的领空，以及在外国组织间谍网等等，都很清楚地表明了美帝国主义的侵略政策。
    评论说，但是，战争不是注定不可避免的，战争是可以防止的。当前，这种防止战争的可能性是现实存在着的。目前世界力量的对比有利于社会主义，因为今天有不许帝国主义为所欲为的强大因素在行动：占全人类三分之一以上的社会主义体系、国际工人运动、亚非和拉丁美洲的千百万人民、中立国家和广泛的和平运动等。正如告世界人民书中所说，“所有这些团结起来进行坚决斗争的爱好和平的力量，能够粉碎罪恶的战争计划，保卫住和平，并且巩固他们之间的友谊。”评论接着说：“今天比任何时候都更加需要提高和加强对帝国主义的阴谋和侵略计划的警惕。必须在今天就不断进行顽强的斗争，反对这些阴谋诡计，保卫和平。”
    评论最后说：阿尔巴尼亚共产党人和阿尔巴尼亚人民完全同意并毫无保留地支持各国共产党和工人党代表会议向全世界人民所发出的保卫和平的历史性的呼吁。阿尔巴尼亚政府和人民在马克思列宁主义政党的领导下，像过去一样仍将不遗余力地为加强社会主义阵营的团结（这是保卫世界和平的主要保证）、为保卫和平和各国人民的安全而斗争，将竭尽全力地进行斗争，揭露帝国主义及其仆从现代修正主义者、特别是南斯拉夫修正主义者的侵略计划，并将提高革命警惕性，不倦地进行努力，以全部力量为实现全世界人民的愿望、为保卫世界和平作出贡献。
