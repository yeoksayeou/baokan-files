Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 10th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam today issued another statement on the current grave situation in Laos, saying that due to the United States and its vassal states' blatant interference in Laos and violation of the Geneva Accords, the current situation in Laos has become very serious. As a party to the Geneva Accords on Laos and a neighbor of Laos, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam feels deeply concerned about the dangerous situation in Laos threatening its own security. Therefore, it cannot turn a blind eye to the blatant interference of the United States in Laos and declares its firm opposition to such interference. The United States and its vassal states must bear full responsibility for the consequences they cause.

The statement said that U.S. imperialism and its vassal states, disregarding the opposition of the legitimate Lao government headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma and the public indignation of the Lao people and peace-loving people all over the world, continue to intensify their military interference in Laos.

The statement said that the United States has supplied the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group with many modern military equipment, including tanks, artillery, and helicopters; U.S. military advisors also directed the ground military operations of the Phoumi Nosavan group from airplanes; Thailand has allowed the Phoumi Nosavan army to use Thai territory as a springboard for attack, and shells from Thai territory bombarded the strongholds of the Royal Army. Thai gunboats were used to attack the gunboats of the Royal Army.

The statement said that in order to attack Vientiane, the United States and its vassal states mobilized a lot of forces to cooperate in the operation. People from the United States, Thailand, South Vietnam, and the Chiang Kai-shek group also participated in commanding the Phoumi army. The U.S. Seventh Fleet Marine Corps in the East Sea is ready to intervene in Laos at any time. South Vietnam is also gathering troops at the 17th parallel – the temporary military demarcation line between North and South Vietnam – and on the border between Laos and South Vietnam.

The statement said that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam calls on the countries concerned, especially the countries serving as chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference and the participating countries of this conference, as well as peace-loving countries, to take effective and urgent measures to stop the bloody claws of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs and safeguard peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 10th: The Soviet "Pravda" today published an article entitled "Stop the Aggressors' Adventurous Actions in Laos," condemning the United States' aggressive activities in Laos.

The article said that the people in Washington are unwilling to let the Lao government follow the path of implementing an independent and peace-loving policy, and they are trying to overthrow the legitimate government of Laos and make it abandon its neutral stance. The United States and the Southeast Asia military bloc subordinate to it are turning the blatant interference in the internal affairs of Laos into open aggression and armed intervention. Imperialist conspirators recently instigated a coup in Vientiane in an attempt to have the rebels seize the capital.

The article, after exposing the United States' supply of a large number of weapons to the rebels, said that while the U.S. State Department is unscrupulously interfering in Laos' internal affairs, it has repeatedly demanded that the Lao government not take any military action against the rebels. This fact shows who is backing the Nosavan group. In addition, the United States is also dragging its partners in the Southeast Asia group – Thailand – into a military adventure against Laos.

The article said that the aggressive activities of the United States and some members of its Southeast Asia group have posed a serious threat to the independence of Laos and the danger of a major war. Peace-loving forces cannot be indifferent to the events in this country.

    越南外交部就老挝局势再次发表声明
    必须制止美国对老挝的猖狂干涉
    苏联“真理报”谴责美国企图推翻老挝合法政府的侵略行为
    新华社河内10日电　越南民主共和国外交部今天就老挝目前严重局势，再次发表声明说，由于美国和它的仆从国家粗暴地干涉老挝和违反日内瓦协议，当前的老挝局势变得十分严重。作为签订关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的一方和老挝的邻国，越南民主共和国为老挝当前的危险局势威胁自己的安全感到十分关心，因此不能对美国明目张胆地干涉老挝的行为置若罔闻，并宣布坚决反对这种干涉。美国和它的仆从国家必须对它们造成的后果负完全责任。
    声明说，美帝国主义及其仆从国家无视以梭发那·富马亲王为首相的老挝合法政府的反对，以及老挝人民和全世界爱好和平人民的公愤，仍然继续变本加厉地对老挝进行军事干涉。
    声明说，美国曾经供给富米·诺萨万叛乱集团许多现代化军事装备，其中包括坦克、大炮、直升飞机；美国军事顾问还在飞机上指挥富米·诺萨万集团的地面军事行动；泰国则让富米·诺萨万军队利用泰国领土作为进攻的跳板，来自泰国领土的炮弹轰击王国军队的据点，泰国的炮艇被用来进攻王国军队的炮艇。
    声明说，为了进攻万象，美国和它的仆从国家动员了很多力量配合行动。美国、泰国、南越和蒋介石集团的人还参加指挥富米军队。在东海的美国第七舰队海军陆战队时刻准备干涉老挝。越南南方还在十七纬度——南、北越之间的临时军事分界线和老挝同南越的边界线上集结军队。
    声明说，越南民主共和国政府呼吁有关国家，首先是担任1954年日内瓦会议主席的国家和这次会议参加国以及爱好和平的国家，采取有效的紧急措施，制止美帝国主义及其走狗的沾满鲜血的魔爪，维护印度支那和东南亚的和平。
    新华社莫斯科10日电　苏联《真理报》今天发表一篇题为《制止侵略者在老挝的冒险行动》的文章，谴责美国对老挝的侵略活动。
    文章说，华盛顿的人们无论如何也不愿让老挝政府走上执行独立和爱好和平政策的道路，他们竭力要推翻老挝的合法政府，使它离开中立的立场。美国和从属于它的东南亚军事集团对老挝内部事务的粗暴干涉，正在变为公开的侵略和武装干涉。帝国主义阴谋家最近策动在万象进行政变，企图使叛乱者夺取首都。
    文章在揭露了美国供应叛乱者大批武器之后说，美国国务院一方面肆无忌惮地干涉老挝内政，一方面又不止一次地要求老挝政府对叛乱者不采取任何军事行动。这一事实说明，谁在给诺萨万集团撑腰。此外，美国还在把东南亚集团里的伙伴——泰国拖入反对老挝的军事冒险活动中。
    文章说，美国和它的东南亚集团的某些成员国的侵略活动，对老挝的独立造成了严重的威胁和发生巨大战火的危险性，爱好和平的力量不能对这一国家的事件漠不关心。
