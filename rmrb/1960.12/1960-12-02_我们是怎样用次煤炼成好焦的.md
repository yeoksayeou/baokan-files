    How We Use Subbituminous Coal to Make Good Coke
    Office of the Director, Yuanshi Coking Plant

    Clever Mixing
    When coal types are complex, clever mixing is the central link to refining good coke from subbituminous coal. Coal mixing requires grasping three key points: (1) Conducting laboratory analysis to determine coal types. For quick analysis, a red-hot iron rod can be inserted into the raw coal pile. If the rod is covered with raw coal, it's coking coal; 50% coverage indicates semi-coking coal; little or no adherence signifies non-coking coal. (2) Storing raw coal in separate piles. (3) Accurately and evenly mixing coal is crucial. More importantly, we must go beyond the office, mobilize the masses to mix coal, ensuring everyone understands the principles and techniques of coal mixing.

    Thin Layers
    If the coal layer is too thick, it won't burn thoroughly, and the coke will be uneven. In soil coke ovens with thin coal layers, we reduced the layer from 1.5 meters to 0.8 meters, rigorously sealed the oven, concentrated the heat, and ensured even burning. This achieved rapid high-temperature refining, resulting in faster coking and a higher coking rate.

    Tamping Solid
    Tamping the coal layer not only creates a cold-pressing effect, forcing coking, but also prevents roof collapse, hollowness, and uncoked areas due to insufficient tamping. More importantly, it enhances coke strength, compels non-coking coal to coke, and improves the quality of coke from subbituminous coal.

    Strong Draft
    Strong draft is a crucial aspect of coking. Our plant employs underground forced-air ovens, using strong, high-temperature drafts to force non-coking coal to coke. This enables us to produce high-quality coke from subbituminous coal, achieving a coking rate of over 80%.

    Fast Burning
    To achieve high quality and high yield, we must adhere to fast burning and high temperatures. Maintaining and increasing furnace temperature is key. Our experience includes: (1) Even coke output across shifts, implementing planned coke output to maintain normal furnace temperature. (2) Everyone taking care of machinery and equipment, strengthening inspection and maintenance to eliminate downtime. (3) Regularly checking machine operation, frequently cleaning pipes, and regularly inspecting gas combustion and coke oven suction, ensuring the furnace temperature remains above 1,000 degrees Celsius. (4) Minimizing openings in the carbonization chamber, avoiding raw coke, preventing gas leaks, and avoiding uncoked areas. (5) Quick discharge and thorough cleaning, quick sealing, quick and full loading, quick leveling, and quick and tight sealing – striving to shorten the coke discharge time to no more than eight minutes per carbonization chamber. We also consistently adhere to feeding dry and hot coal. To stabilize and increase furnace temperature, temperature controllers must adhere to "eight thoroughs and two evens." The eight thoroughs are: "Thorough air ducts, thorough gas ducts, thorough gas straight pipes, thorough gas nozzles, thorough bridge pipes, thorough gas collection ducts, thorough ascending pipes, thorough descending pipes." The two evens are: "Even gas combustion, even suction."

    Small Particles
    Uneven coal particle sizes result in loose coke with low strength. We are making every effort to reduce clean coal particle size, increasing the density of the raw coal fixed screen to ensure that all large particles enter the crusher for crushing. We aim to keep the small particles (under 3mm) in clean coal above 90%, eliminating coal particles larger than 5mm.

    我们是怎样用次煤炼成好焦的
    元氏焦化厂厂长办公室
    巧配
    在煤种复杂的情况下，次煤炼好焦，巧配煤是中心环节。配煤要抓三个环节：（一）抓化验分析，确定煤种。为了化验得快，可将烧红的铁棍插入原煤堆中，如火棍上粘满原煤，就是全焦煤，粘50％是半焦煤，不粘或粘的很少为不结焦煤。（二）抓原煤分堆存放。（三）在配煤中必须掌握搭配准确、均匀。更重要的是走出办公室，发动群众配煤，使人人知道配煤的道理，懂得配煤技术。薄　层
    煤层太厚，燃烧不透，结焦就不匀。薄煤层土焦窑，煤层由一点五米改为零点八米，严加封密，使火力集中，燃烧均匀，达到了高温快炼，结焦快，结焦率高。砸　实
    砸实煤层，不但能起到冷压强迫结焦的作用，还可以杜绝因砸不实造成塌顶，化空和结不住焦的现象，更重要的是能提高焦炭强度，强迫非焦煤结焦，和使次煤结好焦。大　风
    大风是炼焦中的重要环节。我厂采用了地下强力吹风窑，用大风高温，强迫非焦煤结焦，用次煤炼出了优质焦，结焦率达到了80％以上。快　烧
    要想优质高产，必须坚持快烧高温。要快烧高温就得保护炉温，提高炉温。我们的经验是：（一）各班出焦均匀，实行计划出焦，使炉温正常。（二）人人爱护机器设备，加强机器设备的检查维修，消灭停车事故。（三）勤检查机器设备运转情况，勤清扫管道，勤检查煤气燃烧和焦炉吸压力情况，使炉温经常保持在一千度以上。（四）不多打炭化室口，不出生焦，不跑煤气，不化焦。（五）快出出净，快堵堵牢，快装装足，快平平好，快封封严，千方百计缩短出焦时间，达到出一个炭化室不超过八分钟。同时还始终坚持了全部吃干煤吃热煤。为了稳定、提高炉温，调温工要坚持“八透、两均匀”，八透是：“空气道透，煤气道透，煤气直管透，煤气眼透，桥管透，集气道透，上升管透，下降管透。”两均匀是：“煤气燃烧均匀，吸压力均匀”。
    粒小
    颗粒大小不均匀的煤，炼的焦炭容易疏松，强度小。千方百计地缩小净煤颗粒，加密了原煤固定筛，使大颗粒煤全部进入破碎机，进行破碎，使净煤中三个毫米以下的小颗粒煤保持在90％以上，消灭了五个毫米以上的煤粒。（附图片）
