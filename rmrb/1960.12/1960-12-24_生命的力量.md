    The Power of Life
    Shí Gōng
    Typhoons, floods, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions—these are all tremendous natural forces. But there is another natural force—the power of life—that is even greater.
    Life, if viewed as an individual, is insignificant. But when viewed as a collective, it is astonishingly vast, with a long and continuous lifespan, thriving and becoming increasingly prosperous. A single female termite can lay over a million eggs each year. And among living things, termites are not the most prolific. An aphid can produce nearly six billion offspring within five generations. Bacteria have even greater reproductive power; a single bacterium can sometimes turn into over 380 trillion in a single day and night. A gram of soil contains billions of microorganisms. The growth rate and reproductive capacity of plants are also not low. Some fungi can grow five millimeters per minute. These life forms are constantly developing, tirelessly active generation after generation.
    The current appearance of the Earth is inseparable from the activities of life. Many of the rocks that make up the Earth's crust are created by living organisms. Limestone, several thousand meters thick, is the product of the work of tiny coral polyps and even tinier bacteria. Life also extensively destroys the original composition of the Earth's crust. The root of every plant is like a wedge driven into the earth. If it penetrates the cracks in the rock, it can cause the rock to break as it grows. The amount of soil turned over by earthworms is incalculable; some estimate that ten thousand earthworms can till more land than a good horse.
    Life, despite its immense power, is blind. This blind action sometimes brings destruction to certain organisms themselves, and often causes disasters for humans. Many organisms can cause disasters, such as locusts. China has nearly five hundred recorded locust plagues. History describes a locust plague in 785 AD: "From the sea in the east to the river and Longshan in the west, swarms flew, obscuring the sky, for ten days without ceasing. Wherever they reached, grasses, leaves, and even animal hair were completely consumed, leaving starvation in the streets." In 591 AD, locusts in Italy not only destroyed crops, but the stench of dead locusts caused a plague, killing about a million people and animals. However, there is a more important side to the activities of life; it also brings us huge benefits. In the history of the Earth, the activities of life have also created huge deposits of iron, phosphorus, and other minerals. About 80% of the energy consumed worldwide comes from the burning of coal, oil, and natural gas, and these things are mainly transformed from the remains of ancient organisms.
    After the emergence of humans, the highest form of life on Earth, the blindness of life's activities began to change, directing life's activities towards a more beneficial direction. Domesticating wild animals into livestock, cultivating wild plants into crops; hundreds of millions of tons of grain, tens of thousands of tons of meat, are not gifts from nature, but what humans have seized from nature through labor.

    生命的力量
    石工
    台风、洪水、地震、火山爆发，这些都是巨大的自然力。但是还有一种自然力——生命的威力却更为巨大。
    生命，如果把它作为个体来看，那是微不足道的，但是当把它作为群体来看时，它是如此惊人的庞大，而且寿命绵长，生生不息，越来越繁盛。一只雌白蚁每年产卵能到一百万个以上。而在生物中，白蚁还不是繁殖力最强的，一只蚜虫在五代之内能生出近六十亿个子孙。细菌的繁殖力更强，一个细菌有时一天一夜就能变成三百八十多万亿个，在一克土壤中就有数十亿个微生物。植物的生长速度和繁殖能力也不低，有的菌类每分钟可长五毫米。这些生命不断地发展，世世代代孜孜不息地活动。
    地球形成今天的面貌，同生命的活动是分不开的。组成地壳的岩石有许多便是生物造成的，厚达几千米的石灰岩，竟是一种细微的珊瑚虫和比它还微小的细菌工作的产物。生命还广泛地破坏着地壳原来的组成状态，每一株植物的根就是一个打入大地的楔子，如果它钻进了岩石的缝隙，当它长大的时候，能促成岩石的破碎。蚯蚓所翻动的土地更是无法计算的，有人估计一万条蚯蚓比一匹好马所能耕的地还要多。
    生命，它的力量虽然巨大，然而是盲目的。这种盲目的行动有时会给某些生物自身带来了毁灭，也常常造成对人类的灾害。能够造成灾害的生物很多，如蝗虫，我国历史上有记载的蝗灾近五百次，史书上这样描述了公元785年的一次蝗灾：“东自海，西尽河、陇，群飞蔽天，旬日不息，所至草木叶及畜毛，靡有孑遗，饿馑枕道。”公元591年蝗虫在意大利不仅毁坏了庄稼，还因为死蝗虫的臭气引起了瘟疫，死亡人畜约一百万。但是，生命活动还有更重要的一面，它也给我们带来了巨大的利益。在地球历史上，生命的活动还造成了巨大的铁、磷等矿藏，全世界所消耗的能约有80％来自煤、石油和天然气的燃烧，而这些东西主要是古代生物遗体变来的。
    当地球上最高级的生物人类出现以后，生命活动的盲目性开始发生了改变，使生命活动向自己有利的一面发展。把野兽驯化为家畜，把野生植物培育成庄稼；成亿吨的粮食，成万吨的肉类，那并不是自然界的恩赐，而是人类用劳动向自然夺取来的。
