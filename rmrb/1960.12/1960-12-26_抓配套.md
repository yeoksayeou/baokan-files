Industrial support for agriculture must be practical. When manufacturing agricultural tools, consideration must be given to how to ensure that the tools can be fully utilized after they are delivered to the countryside. Doing a good job in providing supporting components is an important link in ensuring the full utilization of agricultural tools. For example, manure collection and application requires not only dung forks and manure baskets, but also manure ladles, shoulder poles, etc. If all these agricultural tools are complete, the commune members will be able to use them with ease; if something is missing, it will reduce labor efficiency, and the existing agricultural tools will be difficult to fully utilize. As another example, if a boat is built but lacks punting poles and oars, the boat will be difficult to use for production.

Now is the time to extensively repair and manufacture agricultural tools for next spring's agricultural production. It is hoped that industrial departments in various regions will refer to the experience of the Yangzhou Special District and pay attention to doing a good job in providing supporting components during the repair and manufacture of agricultural tools. This is not only one of the signs of comprehensive support for agriculture, but also a manifestation of a down-to-earth work style.

    抓配套
    工业支援农业必须讲求实效。造农具的时候，就要考虑到如何使农具下乡以后充分发挥作用。做好配套工作，就是保证农具充分发挥作用的重要一环。例如，积肥施肥既要有粪叉、粪箕，又要有粪勺、扁担等。如果这些农具样样齐全，社员用起来就会得心应手；如果缺这少那，就会降低劳动效率，已有的农具也难以充分发挥效用。又如，一条船造出来，如果缺篙少桨，这条船就难以用于生产。
    现在正是为明春农业生产大修大造农具的时候。希望各地工业部门参考扬州专区的经验，在修造农具过程中注意做好配套工作。这既是全面支援农业的标志之一，也是一种踏踏实实的工作作风的表现。
