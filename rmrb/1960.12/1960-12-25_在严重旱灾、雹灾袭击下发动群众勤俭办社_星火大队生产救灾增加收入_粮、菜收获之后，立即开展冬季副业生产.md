This dispatch from Yinchuan, December 24th, reports that in the Shizuishan City, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Xinghuo Brigade (i.e., accounting unit) of Baofeng Commune, despite suffering a significant disaster this year, fully mobilized the masses, recognized the difficulties, analyzed favorable conditions, persisted in production for disaster relief, and managed the commune diligently and frugally. As a result, the average wage portion distributed to commune members increased by 13.1% compared to last year. At the same time, the production teams were able to supply grain, and the small teams were able to use income from their sideline business to cover expenses for oil, salt, firewood, etc. Ninety percent of commune members increased their income this year.

This year, Xinghuo Brigade suffered a drought unseen in decades. The brigade's wheat fields and summer crops were not irrigated until the end of May, nearly a month later than other areas. In June and July, they were hit by hailstorms unseen in decades. Seventy-three percent of the wheat area was affected, and the damage to 1,400 mu of corn and intercropped beans and melons was quite severe. The brigade party general branch recognized this serious situation, immediately organized work teams to go deep into the fields to ascertain the extent of the disaster, and unhesitatingly presented the disaster situation, assets, policies, and specific disaster relief measures to the masses for discussion. Although nearly 4,000 mu of wheat and summer grains could not be salvaged, the team's more than 5,000 mu of autumn crops could still achieve high yields with all-out efforts. Through patient and meticulous work, the confidence and drive of cadres and commune members were boosted.

In this struggle, cadres at all levels of the Xinghuo Brigade stood at the forefront of the disaster relief effort. Members of the party general branch and all brigade cadres took charge of specific tasks, went deep into the front line of production, participated in production, led disaster relief, and resolutely concentrated more than 90% of the labor force on the agricultural front line. Carpenters, seamstresses, and transport professionals from the production teams were all put into agricultural production as much as possible. All fertilizer was applied to the land, seedlings were replanted wherever possible, and crops were changed and processed where appropriate. Beans and corn were replanted three times in succession, and vegetable seedlings were transplanted multiple times until they survived. The 1,400 mu of cornfields were plowed deeply once. As a result, this year, the grain output of Xinghuo Brigade did not decrease for autumn crops despite reduced summer crop yields. The average corn yield per mu increased by thirty-three jin compared to last year. Vegetables also achieved a bumper harvest. The entire brigade sold more than 600,000 jin of commercial vegetables in addition to their own consumption.

After the grain and vegetables were harvested, Xinghuo Brigade immediately shifted to sideline production in accordance with the agricultural season. In order to mobilize the enthusiasm of the brigade, small teams, and the vast majority of commune members, the scope of operations at all levels was divided according to the party's policies. From August to the present, the total sideline income of the brigade has reached more than 25,000 yuan, an increase of more than 100% compared with the same period last year.

While focusing on increasing production and income, Xinghuo Brigade adhered to the principle of running the commune diligently and frugally, vigorously saving management and production costs, and strictly controlling expenditure procedures. In terms of saving production costs, the brigade adhered to the principle of never buying what they could solve themselves. In the past, wooden shovels and sickle handles had to be purchased from the market, but this year they were all produced by the brigade's own wood factory. As a result, this year's production costs were saved by 11,000 yuan, a decrease of 20% compared to last year.

In order to increase the income of the vast majority of commune members, the brigade implemented the principle of deducting less and distributing more. The proportion of deductions for the entire brigade was reduced by 14% compared to last year. The public accumulation fund and public welfare fund extracted by the brigade accounted for only 3% of the total income, and the consumption portion distributed to commune members reached 65.8%, ensuring that 90% of the commune members increased their income, thus creating a situation of high production enthusiasm and well-arranged lives.

    在严重旱灾、雹灾袭击下发动群众勤俭办社
    星火大队生产救灾增加收入
    粮、菜收获之后，立即开展冬季副业生产
    本报银川24日电　宁夏回族自治区石咀山市宝丰公社星火大队（即核算单位，下同），在今年遭灾相当严重的情况下，由于充分发动群众，认清困难，分析有利条件，坚持生产救灾，勤俭办社，结果分配给社员的工资部分平均每人比去年提高13.1％，同时做到了粮食由生产队供应，油、盐、柴等费用由小队从经营的副业收入中得到解决，90％的社员今年增加了收入。
    今年，星火大队遭受了几十年来罕见的旱灾。全队的麦地和夏作物，直到5月底才灌上头水，比其它地区迟了近一个月；6月和7月又连续受到几十年一遇的大雹灾，小麦受灾面积占73％，一千四百亩玉米和间种的豆子、瓜菜受灾程度相当严重。大队党总支认清了这种严重形势，立即组织工作组深入田间，弄清灾情，并且毫不迟疑地把灾情、家底、政策以及救灾的具体措施，交给群众讨论。全队九千多亩夏秋作物，虽然近四千亩小麦和夏杂粮无法挽救，但五千多亩秋作物，只要全力抢救，还是可以争取高产的。经过耐心细致的工作，鼓起了干部和社员的信心和干劲。
    在这场斗争中，星火大队各级干部站在抗灾最前列。党总支委员和大队全体干部，分工包干，深入生产第一线，参加生产领导救灾，并且坚决地把90％以上的劳动力集中到农业第一线，生产队的木工、缝纫员、运输专业队员等都尽可能地投入农业生产；全部肥料一齐下地，凡是能补苗的都补上了苗，能改种的就改种，能加工的就加工。豆子、玉米接连补种三次，蔬菜苗移一次不行，移两次，直至四次。一千四百亩玉米地都深刨一遍。这样，今年星火大队的粮食产量除夏作物减产外，秋作物没有减产，玉米平均亩产比去年还增加三十三斤；蔬菜也获得丰收，全大队除自吃外，卖出商品菜六十多万斤。
    粮食、蔬菜拿到手之后，星火大队根据农时季节，立即转向副业生产。为了调动大队、小队和广大社员的积极性，根据党的政策，划分了各级经营范围，从8月到现在，全队副业收入已达二万五千多元，比去年同期增长一倍以上。
    星火大队在抓增产增收的同时，坚持勤俭办社的方针，大力节约管理费用和生产费用，并严格开支手续。在节约生产费用方面，大队坚持了凡是能自己解决的，决不花钱买的原则。过去木锹、镰刀把等，都要到市场上去买，今年全部由大队木工厂自己生产。这样，今年的生产费用节约了一万一千元，比去年减少20％。
    为了使绝大多数社员增加收入，大队贯彻执行了少扣多分的原则。全队扣留的部分比去年降低14％，大队提取的公积金和公益金只占总收入的3％，分配给社员的消费部分达到65.8％，保证了全队90％的社员增加收入，从而出现了生产干劲高，生活安排得好的局面。（附图片）
