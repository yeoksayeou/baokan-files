Xinhua News Agency, December 15th: Today, in our capital city of Beijing, a colorful corridor of people, stretching for dozens of miles, sent out enormous cheers to the visiting Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Approximately 400,000 people gathered on the streets, warmly and enthusiastically welcoming the respected guest from our fraternal southern neighbor.

To welcome the distinguished Cambodian guests, the capital was decked out as if for a festival. A dense array of colored flags almost blocked Chang'an Avenue, the widest street running east to west. Many tall buildings were decorated with red flags, and the balconies of some high-rise buildings were packed with welcoming crowds. In the welcoming processions, people held aloft portraits of Prince Sihanouk, waved colorful bouquets, garlands, and silk ribbons, and threw handfuls of colored confetti and streamers at the distinguished guests. The enthusiastic cheers, the sounds of gongs and drums, and the firecrackers transported people to a traditional festive atmosphere.

The capital's people welcomed the distinguished guests with extremely solemn and grand ceremonies. This friendly sentiment expressed the friendly feelings of the 650 million Chinese people. They paid their respects to Prince Sihanouk, who pursues a policy of peace and neutrality, and to the Cambodian people, who have always been friendly to the Chinese people.

After the grand welcoming ceremony at the train station, the distinguished guests rode in open-top cars through the city, meeting the hundreds of thousands of Beijing residents who lined the streets to welcome them. At the head of the long motorcade, Prince Sihanouk was accompanied by Chairman Liu Shaoqi, while His Excellency Prince Penn Nouth, Vice-Chairman of the Cambodian Throne Council, and Prime Minister Pho Proeung were accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai. First Deputy Prime Minister Nhiek Tioulong was accompanied by Vice Premiers Chen Yi and Ulanhu. They rode in three magnificent open-top cars, advancing slowly. Colored flowers danced in the streets, colored flags were like a forest, and the assembled crowds emitted earth-shattering cheers. Everywhere was permeated with an intense and jubilant atmosphere of friendship.

People still remember that when Prince Sihanouk left our country for the second time in 1958, he said affectionately to the crowds who came to see him off: "Dearest friends, I am not saying goodbye to you, but rather saying see you again soon!" Only a little over two years have passed, and the Prince's friendly wish has been realized once again. Today, as the crowds lining the streets eagerly awaited the arrival of the distinguished guests, the loudspeakers on the streets broadcast the enthusiastic and friendly sounds and bursts of applause from the welcoming ceremony at the Beijing Railway Station. When the Prince mentioned in his reply that the two countries were about to conclude a treaty of friendship and non-aggression, enthusiastic applause erupted from the hundreds of thousands of people lined up to welcome him. Tens of thousands of people gathered in the square in front of the capital's railway station to welcome the guests. As soon as the distinguished guests stepped out of the station, a sudden burst of cheers erupted, and Prince Sihanouk and the other distinguished guests were immersed in a joyous ocean of friendship. Across from the station stood a huge portrait of Prince Sihanouk. People were dressed in festive attire, cheering and jumping. A group of Young Pioneers beat small copper drums, blew small bugles, and played welcoming music. A large group of girls rushed forward, scattering colorful ribbons on Prince Sihanouk and other distinguished guests. The vehicles moved slowly forward, and the ribbons fluttered in the wind.

As the open-top cars passed by the ranks of male and female worker-militia members near the station, a chorus of cheers rang out. The militia members, holding their rifles, shouted: "Long live world peace!" Prince Sihanouk waved to them frequently. Xu Zhaoxin, a member of the First Machine Tool Plant's militia, said excitedly after seeing the heads of state of China and Cambodia riding side by side in the car: "In the common struggle against imperialism and in defense of Asian and world peace, the people of China and Cambodia need to join hands and support each other."

The solemn and majestic Tiananmen Square was decorated with flowers and bustling with activity today. Palace lanterns hung high above the Tiananmen Gate, and red flags fluttered on the tall buildings such as the Great Hall of the People and the Museum of History. Large balloons floated in the air with giant slogans such as "Respect to the Cambodian People" and "Respect to His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk, Head of State of Cambodia." When Prince Sihanouk and the other distinguished guests' open-top cars entered the square, firecrackers exploded and drums and gongs resounded. Thousands of colorful balloons slowly rose into the clear sky, and three "colored dragons" in the center of the square writhed and danced, while more than a dozen "golden lions" danced to their hearts' content. Young people dressed in the costumes of thirteen ethnic groups enthusiastically performed the national unity dance here. The distinguished guests' cars circled the square, and the welcoming people sang, danced, and shouted slogans. Su Ying, a female student from a returned overseas Chinese family who was born in Phnom Penh sixteen years ago, shouted "Welcome His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk!" and "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian peoples!" to the Prince in Cambodian. The Prince smiled broadly and waved enthusiastically to thank the girl.

Among the welcoming crowds were also large numbers of members of urban people's communes, government cadres, literary and art workers, and religious figures. Some elderly people wearing reading glasses and children wearing red scarves also joined the welcoming ranks. In front of the imposing National Culture Palace, female commune members wearing new clothes waved colored flags and floral headscarves, constantly cheering and greeting the distinguished guests.

Tens of thousands of university students in the capital gathered near the guesthouse, showering the distinguished guests with sincere friendship. Several female students from the Renmin University of China shouted, jumped, and couldn't help but rush out of the ranks, forcefully throwing long colored ribbons towards the distinguished guests. Young students from more than thirty ethnic groups at the Central University for Nationalities held high the national flags of China and Cambodia, cheering to their hearts' content. Suo Geng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation and a Tibetan student, as well as Luo A'ni, a Miao student, and Lei Jianchun, a Dai student, had welcomed Prince Sihanouk at the airport and in their schools two years ago. Today, they couldn't contain their joy. When Prince Sihanouk's car approached them, Suo Geng took the lead in shouting: "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian peoples!" Luo A'ni and Lei Jianchun borrowed the lyrics from the "Blessing Dance," which the Cambodian Queen had specially choreographed for Chairman Mao several years ago, saying: "May these flowers presented to you express our hearts." "Peace and friendship connect our two countries."

Today is a festival of friendship and a festival of unity between the Chinese and Cambodian peoples. The kinship-like friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian peoples is connected like the waters of the Lancang River and the Mekong River, flowing forever. China-Cambodia, let us cheer for the ascent to new heights of friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian peoples! (Photo attached)

    为中柬两国人民登上友谊的新高峰而欢呼
    首都人民隆重欢迎西哈努克亲王
    新华社15日讯　今天在我国的首都北京，一条延伸数十华里的五彩缤纷的人群长廊，向来访的诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王殿下发出了巨大的欢呼。大约有四十多万人聚集在街头，盛大热烈地欢迎来自南国的亲戚之邦的尊敬贵宾。
    为了欢迎柬埔寨贵宾，首都披上了节日般的盛装。密密麻麻的彩旗几乎阻塞了东西长安大街这条最宽大的街道。许多高大的建筑物都插上了红旗，有些高楼的凉台上也挤满了欢迎的群众。在欢迎的队伍中，人们高举着西哈努克亲王的肖像，挥舞着五颜六色的花束、花环和彩绸，大把的彩纸屑和彩纸条向贵宾们身上投去。热烈欢腾的口号声、锣鼓声和鞭炮声，简直把人们引入了传统的节日佳境。
    首都人民以极其隆重盛大的礼仪来迎接贵宾，这种友好的感情，表达了六亿五千万中国人民友好的心意。他们向执行和平中立政策的西哈努克亲王殿下致敬，向一贯同中国人民友好的柬埔寨人民致敬。
    在车站上举行隆重的欢迎仪式以后，贵宾们乘敞篷汽车横贯全城，会见夹道欢迎的数十万北京群众。在一长列贵宾车队的前头，西哈努克亲王殿下由刘少奇主席陪同，柬埔寨王位最高委员会副主席宾努阁下和首相福·波伦阁下由周总理陪同，柬埔寨政府第一副首相?·刁隆阁下由陈毅、乌兰夫副总理陪同，分别乘三辆华丽的敞篷汽车，徐徐前进。街道上彩花飞舞，彩旗如林，云集的人群发出震天动地的欢呼声，到处都弥漫着一片强烈的欢腾的友谊气氛。
    人们还记得，西哈努克亲王1958年第二次离开我国时曾经亲切地对欢送的群众说：“最亲爱的朋友们，我不是向你们告别，而是向你们说不久再见！”时间仅仅过了两年多，亲王殿下这个友好的愿望再一次实现了。今天，当夹道欢迎的群众热切地盼望着贵宾到来的时候，街道上的扩音器传来了北京车站欢迎仪式上热情友好的声浪和一阵阵的掌声。当亲王在致答词中谈到两国即将缔结友好互不侵犯条约时，几十万列队欢迎的群众中响起了热烈的掌声。在首都车站前面的广场上，站列了好几万欢迎的群众。贵宾们一走出车站，一片欢呼声骤然而起，亲王殿下等贵宾在这里沉浸在欢乐友谊的海洋之中。车站的对面树立着西哈努克亲王的巨幅画像。人们穿着盛装，欢呼跳跃。一群少先队员敲着小铜鼓，吹着小铜号，高奏起欢迎的乐曲。一大群姑娘涌向前去，把五色彩带撒在西哈努克亲王及其他贵宾的身上，车辆缓缓前进，彩带随风飘扬。
    当敞篷汽车在车站附近的男女工人民兵的行列旁走过时，响起了一片欢呼声。民兵队员们擎着枪高呼：“世界和平万岁！”西哈努克亲王频频向他们招手致意。第一机床厂的民兵队员徐朝信，看到中柬两国国家元首肩并肩地乘车前进，他激动地说：“在反对帝国主义、保卫亚洲和世界和平的共同斗争中，中柬两国人民需要手挽手互相支持”。
    庄严雄伟的天安门广场，今天被打扮得花团锦簇，热闹异常。城楼上高悬着宫灯，人民大会堂、历史博物馆等高大建筑物上红旗飘扬，凌空而起的大气球垂挂着“向柬埔寨人民致敬”、“向柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王殿下致敬”等巨幅标语。当西哈努克亲王殿下等贵宾的敞篷汽车进入广场时，鞭炮齐鸣，锣鼓喧天，成千个五彩气球冉冉升上晴空，广场中心三条“彩龙”翻腾起舞，十多只“金狮”尽情地欢跳，有穿着十三种民族服装的青年在这里热情地跳起了民族大团结舞。贵宾们的汽车在这里绕场一周，欢迎的人们载歌载舞，高呼口号。十六年前出生在金边的一位归国华侨女学生苏英向亲王殿下用柬埔寨语高呼“欢迎西哈努克亲王殿下！”“中柬人民友好万岁！”这位亲王笑容满面，热情地向姑娘招手致谢。
    在欢迎的人群里，还有大批的城市人民公社社员、机关干部、文艺工作者和宗教界人士。有些戴着老花镜的老人和围着红领巾的孩子也参加进欢迎的行列。在巍峨的民族文化宫前面，穿着新装的女社员们，挥动彩旗和花头巾，不断地向贵宾们欢呼致意。
    首都的数万大学生聚集在迎宾馆的附近，他们向贵宾们倾泻着真挚的友情。中国人民大学几个女学生喊着，跳跃着，情不自禁地冲出了队伍，用力把长条彩带抛向贵宾们。中央民族学院三十多个民族的青年学生高举中柬两国国旗，尽情地欢呼着。在这个队伍里的中华全国学联副主席、藏族学生索更，以及苗族女学生罗阿妮和傣族学生雷建春，两年前曾经在机场和自己学校里欢迎过西哈努克亲王，今天他们抑止不住喜悦的心情。当西哈努克亲王乘坐的汽车驶近他们面前时，索更带头喊道：“中柬人民友好万岁！”；罗阿妮和雷建春借用几年前柬埔寨王后特意为献给毛主席而排练的“祝福舞”中的歌词说：“愿这些呈献给你们的花朵，能表达出我们的心意。”“和平与友谊联系着我们两个国家。”
    今天，是中柬两国人民友好的节日，是团结的节日。中柬人民亲戚般的情谊，像澜沧江和湄公河的水那样地连接在一起，永远奔流不息。中国—柬埔寨，为中柬两国人民登上友谊的新高峰而欢呼吧！（附图片）
