Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 7th. According to Soviet newspapers, while continuously constructing a large number of new factories and enterprises, the Soviet Union is also vigorously reconstructing and expanding existing enterprises and updating their equipment in accordance with the Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965) in order to increase industrial production. According to statistics, the total investment in this area in the Soviet Union this year reached 90 billion rubles, which is equal to half of the total national investment in the construction of new enterprises this year.

Vigorously reconstructing and expanding existing enterprises and updating their equipment is currently one of the important ways for the Soviet Union to develop industrial production. Through this approach, it is possible to gain time to rapidly increase labor productivity in industry and increase production without expanding production sites and without increasing too much investment. Taking the steel industry as an example, according to statistics, during the Seven-Year Plan, the increase in the output of pig iron, steel and steel products through this approach will account for three-quarters of the total increase in output during the seven years. Simply by improving some blast furnaces and using natural gas for iron smelting, the Soviet blast furnaces will be able to produce more than 500,000 tons of pig iron and save more than 2 million tons of coking coal this year. It is estimated that by taking this measure in 1961, the country will be able to produce 2.9 million tons of pig iron and save more than 3 million tons of coking coal; and it would require an investment of 1 billion rubles to establish mines and coking ovens capable of producing so much coking coal.

In the work of enterprise reconstruction and production equipment renewal, engineers, technicians and workers of industrial enterprises in various parts of the Soviet Union have played a great role. They brought their creativity into play and enthusiastically participated in the work of reconstructing enterprises and updating old equipment. At the beginning of this year, the staff and workers of the famous New Kramatorsk Machine-Building Plant in Donbass formulated a design plan for reconstructing the factory and manufactured thousands of tons of parts for retrofitting the factory's rolling mill and steel ingot crane. Due to the updating of equipment, this factory will be able to produce more than 140 million rubles worth of products this year. This year, the factory's employees also helped the "Ilyich" Steel Plant and the Zaporozhye Steel Plant in Zhdanov reconstruct a "1700" thick steel plate rolling mill and a "1680" rolling mill, resulting in the two rolling mills being able to produce more than 1.5 million tons of steel per year. This is more economical by 130 million rubles than investing in the establishment of a new rolling mill. A group of Communist Party designers at the Dneprodzerzhinsk Steel Plant have been working hard to renovate the factory's large rolling mill for a long time. Designer Ivanin wanted to increase the number of steel ingots rolled at a time on the factory's large rolling mill from one to two. For several months, he and some experts and scholars conducted research and discussed with the workers, and as a result, the rolling mill was successfully renovated recently, increasing the rolling efficiency by 30% at once, and it can produce hundreds of millions of rubles worth of products for the country every year. The staff and workers of the Azov Steel Plant in Zhdanov City recently renovated the factory's two old blast furnaces with automatic material transport boxes and metering devices. The output of the open-hearth furnace workshop of this factory has increased by dozens of tons after the renovation, and the smelting time of the open-hearth furnace has been shortened by almost one and a half hours. According to preliminary estimates, the labor productivity of steel workers will be increased by 84% after the factory's overall reconstruction is completed.

Many light industrial enterprises in various parts of the Soviet Union are also actively carrying out expansion and reconstruction. The Stalin Textile Factory in Tashkent has overfulfilled the state production plan by 28 million rubles in the first three quarters of this year due to the reconstruction of the enterprise and the renewal of equipment. The "Lilia" sewing factory in the Lithuanian Republic has also made great achievements in the reconstruction of the enterprise. The workers of this factory completely renovated all the workshops and sections of the factory almost within one year by their own efforts. After the reconstruction of the enterprise, this year, the factory will hand over to the state a product output value that is more than 55 million rubles higher than last year; the factory's seven-year plan to increase labor productivity will also be completed ahead of schedule in 1962. The workers of the Tashkent No. 1 Shoe Factory have also recently completed the reconstruction of the enterprise. In the reconstruction work, Communist Party members Kuznetsov, Kuraev and others worked with the workers to formulate a technical plan for reconstructing the factory at the beginning of this year, and quickly began the reconstruction work. During the reconstruction process, this factory installed a total of 29 conveyor belts, eight reversing devices and more than 200 other new production equipment. After the reconstruction, the factory greatly increased its output without expanding the production site, and increased the average labor productivity of all workers in the factory by 18%.

    在不扩大生产场地和增加太多投资的条件下迅速提高生产
    苏联大力改建和扩建现有工业企业
    今年用在这方面的投资等于建筑新企业的总投资的一半
    新华社莫斯科7日电　据苏联报刊报道，苏联在不断建设大批新的工厂企业的同时，还正在根据七年计划（1959—1965年）大力改建、扩建现有企业和更新现有企业的设备，以提高工业生产。据统计，今年苏联用在这方面的投资总共达九百亿卢布，等于今年全国用于建筑新企业的总投资的一半。
    大力改建、扩建现有企业和更新现有企业的设备，是目前苏联发展工业生产的重要途径之一。通过这一途径，就有可能在不扩大生产场地和不增加太多的投资的条件下，更快地争取时间迅速提高工业中的劳动生产率和增加生产。以钢铁工业为例，据统计，在七年计划期间，苏联生铁、钢和钢材通过这种途径而增加的产量将占七年间产量总增加额的四分之三。单是由于对某些高炉进行改进和使用天然瓦斯炼铁，就将使今年苏联的高炉能多炼出五十多万吨生铁和节约二百多万吨焦煤。估计在1961年内由于采取这种措施，全国将能多生产二千九百万吨生铁和节约三百多万吨焦煤；而要建立能生产这样多焦煤的矿井和炼焦炉就需要有十亿卢布的投资。
    在企业改建和生产设备的更新工作中，苏联各地工业企业的工程师、技术员和工人起了很大的作用。他们发挥创造积极性，热情地参加了改建企业和更新旧有设备的工作。顿巴斯著名的新克拉马托尔斯克机器制造厂的职工在今年年初制定了改建工厂的设计方案，并为改装工厂的轧钢机、钢锭吊车制造了几千吨部件。由于更新了设备，这个工厂在今年内能多生产价值一亿四千多万卢布的产品。这个工厂的职工今年还帮助日丹诺夫的“伊里奇”钢铁厂和萨坡罗什炼钢厂改建了一台“1700”号厚钢板压轧机和一台“1680”号轧钢机，结果使两台轧钢机一年能多生产一百五十多万吨钢材。这比投资建立新的轧钢机要节约一亿三千多万卢布。第聂伯罗捷尔任斯基钢铁工厂的一批共产党员设计师，好久以来就为改装工厂的大型轧钢机而努力着。设计师伊凡宁想把这个工厂的大型轧钢机一次轧一块钢锭增加到一次轧两块。几个月来他和一些专家和学者进行研究，并和工人们在一块商量，结果于最近改装成功这台轧钢机，把轧钢效率一下子提高了30％，每年能为国家多生产成亿卢布的产品。日丹诺夫城的亚速钢铁工厂的职工，最近用自动运料箱和计量装置改建了工厂的两座老高炉。这个工厂的平炉车间，在改装了以后产量一下增加了几十吨，平炉的熔炼时间差不多缩短了一个半小时。据初步估计，这个工厂全面改建完成以后，钢铁工人的劳动生产率将能提高84％。
    苏联各地许多轻工业企业也在积极进行扩建和改建。塔什干的斯大林纺织工厂由于改建了企业和更新了设备，今年头三个季度内就为国家超计划生产了价值二千八百万卢布的产品。立陶宛共和国的“立利亚”缝纫工厂在改建企业方面也取得了很大成绩。这个工厂的工人们完全用自己的力量差不多在一年过程中就改建了本厂的一切车间和工段。在企业改建后，今年，工厂上交给国家的产品产值将比去年多五千五百多万卢布；工厂的提高劳动生产率的七年计划，也将在1962年提前完成。塔什干第一制鞋厂的工人，最近也完成了企业的改建工作。在改建工作中，共产党员库兹涅佐夫、库拉耶夫等人和工人一起在今年年初制定了改建工厂的技术方案，并很快着手改建工作。这个工厂在改建过程中，共安装了二十九条传送带，八个换向装置和二百多台其他新的生产设备。改建以后，工厂在不扩大生产场地的条件下，大大增加了产量并把全厂工人的劳动生产率平均提高了18％。（附图片）
