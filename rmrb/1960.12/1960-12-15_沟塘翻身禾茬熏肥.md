    Turning Ditches and Ponds into Fertilizer by Smoldering Wheat Stubble
    Our commune's Minle Production Team, drawing on the experience of increased wheat production this year, has launched a winter fertilizer accumulation campaign. Initially, some people believed that winter fertilizer sources were limited, relying only on pig and livestock manure. The Party General Branch of the production team mobilized everyone to contribute ideas and suggestions to broaden fertilizer sources. The members of each production team enthusiastically discussed winter fertilizer accumulation work, offering ideas and finding methods to accumulate more fertilizer for summer harvest crops. This production team is close to the coast, so members suggested collecting mussel shells to manufacture indigenous chemical fertilizer. Other members pointed out that summer rainwater runoff causes a lot of sludge to accumulate in ditches and ponds, and winter, when the water is shallow, is a good time to dig up mud for fertilizer. Some also mentioned that certain production teams have a habit of using wheat stubble roots for smoldering fertilizer and suggested that the production team promote this practice comprehensively. The Party General Branch decided that, in addition to the production team building a factory to produce indigenous chemical fertilizer from mussel shells, it would mobilize members to carry out a fertilizer accumulation competition based on turning ditches and ponds and smoldering wheat stubble. In seven days, the entire team accumulated 320,000 dan of fertilizer, and 230 mu of Class Three wheat fields have already received topdressing.

    沟塘翻身禾茬熏肥
    我们公社民乐生产队吸取了今年三麦增产的经验，开展起了冬季积肥运动。开始，有的人认为冬季肥源不多，只有靠养猪和大牲畜积肥。生产队党总支发动人人献计献策，广开肥源，各个生产小队的社员都热烈的讨论了冬季积肥工作，出主意，想办法，为夏收作物多积肥料。这个生产队靠近海滩，社员就建议拾蚌壳制造土化肥。还有的社员提出，夏季雨水冲积，很多污泥都沉积在沟塘里，冬天水浅，正是挖泥肥的好时机。还有人说有的生产小队有利用禾茬根熏肥的习惯，建议生产队全面推广。党总支决定除了由生产队统一建厂用蚌壳制土化肥以外，发动社员开展了沟塘翻身、禾茬熏肥的积肥竞赛。七天时间，全队就积肥三十二万担，现已有二百三十亩三类麦田上了追肥。
