Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, December 23rd. Tibetan folk artists who used to wander and sing for a living have been properly resettled during the democratic reforms and have begun new lives. Before the democratic reforms, it was common to see starving and freezing wandering artists playing the six-stringed lute and singing from door to door in Lhasa, Shigatse, Qamdo, Shannan and other regions. After the start of the democratic reforms, folk artists, like the emancipated serfs, were allocated houses and land and settled down. Some joined literary and artistic groups and became professional literary and artistic workers; the old, weak, and disabled were also taken in by relevant government departments, and their lives were guaranteed.

The "Jiumulong" Tibetan opera troupe, the oldest in Tibet with a history of more than 300 years, used to make a living by performing and begging. The entire troupe had only 31 people and could only perform three plays. Now the actors have moved into new homes allocated to them by the government, receive monthly wages, and have good performing conditions. The number of people in this troupe has increased to 84. It can not only perform more than ten traditional plays, but also created and compiled eleven new plays welcomed by the masses in the past year. Zaxi Dunzhu, the head of the troupe, who suffered all kinds of torture in his past forty years of performing, also attended the Third National Congress of Literary and Art Workers as a representative of the Tibetan literary and art circles in July this year, and was elected as a member of the Third Committee of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Dorje, a blind artist from Lhasa, moved into a house, wore new clothes, and ate tsampa for the first time last year after wandering for twenty years. He sang emotionally, "The sun of happiness is rising!"

    过去沿门卖唱　现在得到妥善安排
    西藏民间艺人开始新生活
    新华社拉萨23日电　过去沿门卖唱的西藏民间艺人，在民主改革中得到妥善安排，开始了新的生活。在拉萨、日喀则、昌都、山南等地区，民主改革前经常可以看到饥寒交迫的流浪艺人，弹着六弦琴沿门卖唱。民主改革开始后，民间艺人也和翻身农奴一样，分到了房屋和土地并且定居下来，有些人参加了文艺团体，成为专业的文艺工作者；老弱残废也被政府的有关部门收容起来，生活有了保障。
    具有三百多年历史的西藏最古老的“觉木隆”藏剧团，过去是边卖艺边乞讨，全团只有三十一个人，只能演出三种剧目。现在演员们迁入了政府拨给他们的新居，按月领到工资，并有了良好的演出条件。这个剧团的人数已增加到八十四人，不仅能演出十多种传统剧目，在最近一年中还创作和整理了受群众欢迎的十一个新剧目。在过去四十多年演出生活中受尽折磨的剧团团长札西顿珠，今年7月还作为西藏文艺界代表出席了全国文艺工作者第三次代表大会，并被选为全国文联第三届委员会委员。拉萨的盲艺人多吉，在流浪了二十年后，去年才第一次搬进了房屋，穿上了新衣，吃到了?粑，他感动地唱道：“幸福的太阳升起来了！”
