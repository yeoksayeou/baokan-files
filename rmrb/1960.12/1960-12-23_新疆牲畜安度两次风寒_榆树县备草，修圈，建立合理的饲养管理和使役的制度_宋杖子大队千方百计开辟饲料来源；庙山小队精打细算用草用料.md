Our Urumqi dispatch on the 22nd. People's communes throughout the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are protecting large livestock from all sides to ensure they safely overwinter, striving for cattle and horses to be strong and fat, providing sufficient animal power for next year's spring plowing production. Livestock throughout the autonomous region have safely weathered two major cold snaps and snowstorms, with basically no losses.

All localities first focused on stockpiling winter grass and feed. Parts of Northern and Southern Xinjiang have completed the autonomous region's requirement of stockpiling an average of 1,000 jin of winter grass per head of large livestock. In counties such as Hami, Yiwu, and Barkol, winter grass plus agricultural by-products such as wheat bran, average 1,800 jin of overwintering feed per head of large livestock. This year, during the gaps between summer harvesting, autumn planting, and autumn harvesting, localities also continuously carried out several crash grass-cutting campaigns to stockpile winter grass as early as possible, and paid attention to collecting and storing agricultural by-products that can be used as feed. Some communes and ranches in Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture have also prepared a large amount of feed salt and ghee, preparing to feed postpartum female livestock to help them quickly recover their strength, enhance their lactation ability, and improve the survival rate of young livestock.

All localities universally repaired and built new sheds for large livestock to overwinter, striving to ensure that most livestock can overwinter in sheds. The autonomous region has currently repaired and built more than 160,000 sheds (including those for small livestock to overwinter). Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture built, renovated, and repaired more than 1,000 sheds this winter, all of which meet the requirements of warmth and hygiene. The large sheds built in Nilek County are divided into several small pens to classify and place livestock, which facilitates livestock management.

Since the beginning of winter, all localities have strengthened feeding management, paid attention to combining work and rest, and regarded this as an important task for large livestock to overwinter. The relevant leading departments of the autonomous region require all localities to strictly implement careful feeding of coarse feed, increase the necessary feeding personnel in winter, properly arrange the utilization of large livestock, and strive to allow each draft animal to rest for two months within the three to four months from this winter to next year's spring plowing, and at least one and a half months, with particularly weak animals ceasing to be used to allow draft animals to increase their strength.

Our Changchun dispatch on the 22nd. Yushu County, Jilin Province, has established a reasonable feeding management and utilization system to ensure the safe overwintering of large livestock, to meet the high tide of spring plowing production next year.

The Yushu County Party Committee first mobilized and led the masses to vigorously grasp cold protection equipment and feed storage work. By the end of November, the county had built more than 5,800 new livestock sheds, accounting for 67% of the original livestock sheds. In the work of feed storage, communes, management areas, production teams, and farms, ensiled a large amount of corn stalks and collected various wild dry grass. The county ensiled a total of 78.71 million jin of corn stalks and 52.43 million jin of wild dry grass. Production teams also combined threshing to collect and store a large amount of various substitute feeds, collecting all edible agricultural by-products such as bean skins and sorghum shells, totaling more than 40 million jin. At present, each head of livestock in the county has an average of more than 1,700 jin of feed, plus straw, which can be connected to next year's new grass. Communes throughout the county also carefully arranged feed, especially the rational use of concentrated feed, and implemented the method of "grading livestock, determining the quantity according to the grade, implementing it to livestock, and feeding it monthly."

Communes also focused on strengthening the recovery of weak livestock and the protection of pregnant livestock. Communes universally implemented the feeding of old and weak livestock, pregnant livestock, and strong livestock in separate groups, in separate troughs, and in separate pens; dedicated personnel feed dedicated livestock; concentrated feed is used according to a fixed quantity; dedicated personnel use them; coarse feed is changed into fine feed, all feed is crushed, and every inch of grass is chopped three times; various concentrated feeds are fried, warmed, and cooked, so that raw food becomes cooked food, hard food becomes soft food, and cold food becomes hot food. At the same time, old, weak, and pregnant livestock are given more grass, more feed, more salt, increased feeding and drinking times, and extended grazing time. For the utilization of weak and pregnant livestock, light utilization or no utilization is stipulated.

As a result of these effective measures, according to a survey at the end of November, the large livestock in the county generally gained weight and recovered, with third-class livestock decreasing from 23% of the total number in the past to 7.6%, second-class livestock increasing from 26.6% to 32.7%, and first-class livestock increasing from 50.4% to 59.7%.

Our dispatch. The Songzhangzi Brigade of the Songzhangzi People's Commune in Lingyuan County, Liaoning Province, has tried every means to expand the source of livestock feed, and at the same time, it has formulated a plan for arranging grass and feed early in the year, and carefully calculated and saved grass, so that livestock feed has changed from insufficient to surplus.

The Songzhangzi Production Brigade has 1,216 heads of large livestock, which require 2.81 million jin of forage from October this year to the end of September next year. Because various natural disasters have been suffered continuously this year, the whole brigade can only produce 800,000 jin of straw, and there is still a shortage of 2.01 million jin. In order to solve the problem of insufficient forage, the Party Branch held a general branch meeting, a mass meeting, and a feeder meeting to mobilize everyone to come up with ideas and find solutions. Everyone proposed methods such as expanding the variety of forage, collecting yellow grass, and implementing grazing. As a result, a total of 1.9 million jin of corn stalks, foxtail millet residue, sorghum stubble, and bean stubble that can be used as feed to replace straw were collected.

The brigade has formulated a plan for "arranging grass and feed early in the year" for the next eight months. The specific method is: determine the quantity based on livestock, eat more when busy, eat less when idle, and match coarse and fine. For example, a detailed allocation was made for the amount of grass used by 523 cattle in the entire brigade: each draft cattle uses 2,500 jin of forage a year, grazing cattle 800 jin, and young cattle 500 jin (calculated with a maximum of 18 jin and a minimum of 8 jin per day). Within this total amount of grass used, it is stipulated that first-class grass (straw) accounts for one-quarter, second-class grass (corn stubble) accounts for two-quarters, and third-class grass (bean stubble and weeds) accounts for one-quarter. At the same time, within the scope of not exceeding the annual grass and feed quota, adjustments are made according to the specific situation of each period, each stage, and each head of livestock, eating more during the working period, eating less when grazing; eating more during busy farming, eating less during slack farming; and giving pregnant, old, and sick livestock more fine and soft grass. After such careful calculation and proper arrangement, the team can also have a surplus of 70,000 jin of forage for reserve.

In order to truly realize the plan and achieve the goal of both feeding livestock well and saving feed, the Songzhangzi Brigade also implemented a responsibility system of dedicated personnel for dedicated livestock and contracted grass and feed, and respectively assigned the responsibility to the team feeders. A monthly evaluation and inspection system is also stipulated to organize feeders to carry out competitions with each other. In each evaluation and inspection, feeders who save forage and make livestock gain weight are rewarded.

Our dispatch. The Miaoshan Team of the Miaoshan Brigade of the Pulandian Town People's Commune in Xinjin County, Liaoning Province, summarized the experience of the masses in feeding livestock, and implemented the grass-boiling section, soft-soaking material, and short-chopping method of using grass and material to save a large amount of forage and make livestock gain weight.

This team produced 117,000 jin of forage this year, which is only enough for the existing 52 draft animals to use for four months, and there is still a shortage of five months of forage. With the help of the brigade Party branch, the team held a mass symposium to organize people with experience in raising livestock to offer advice and suggestions. The masses put forward more than a dozen opinions, which can be summarized as: boiling grass section, soft-soaking material, and short-chopping method, saving grass and increasing weight.

Team feeders Yang Quanlin and Zhang Yushan conscientiously implemented new methods of saving feed. They changed the corn stalks from the past one cut two inches long to one inch of grass chopped three times. In terms of feeding methods, they implemented fixed food and quantity, fixed times, and fixed feeding methods: draft cattle are fed three meals a day, three sieves of grass per meal; dry grass is fed in the morning and at noon, and the remaining grass sections are added with water material. The remaining grass sections are finally added with a small amount of table salt and boiled in a pot for two hours the next day. After feeding dry grass twice in the evening, the boiled grass sections are fed again, eaten to most of it, and then mixed with water material, and it is all eaten up. When feeding concentrated feed, they changed the original dry feeding to water feeding, first frying the raw material to seven or eight minutes cooked, then grinding it into pieces, and then soaking it in water, so that one jin of dry material can top two jin.

After this team promoted this method, draft animals changed from thin to fat, saving both grass and feed. Horses used to eat 20 jin a day, but now they eat 13 jin. Draft cattle used to eat one jin of concentrated feed a day, but now they eat half a jin a day. The whole team saved more than 4,500 bundles of corn stalks and 450 jin of concentrated feed from October 20th to November 20th. The draft animals in the whole team generally gained weight, and the five weakest old cattle also gained weight.

    新疆牲畜安度两次风寒
    榆树县备草，修圈，建立合理的饲养管理和使役的制度
    宋杖子大队千方百计开辟饲料来源；庙山小队精打细算用草用料
    本报乌鲁木齐22日电新疆维吾尔自治区各地人民公社从各方面保护大牲畜安全过冬，力争牛马膘肥体壮，为明年春耕生产提供足够的畜力。全自治区的牲畜已经安全度过两次较大的寒流和风雪，基本上没有损失。
    各地首先抓紧了过冬饲草和饲料的储备。北疆和南疆部分地区完成了自治区要求平均每头大牲畜储备一千斤冬草的指标。哈密、伊吾、巴里坤等县，冬草加上麦麸等农副产品，平均每头大牲畜已有越冬饲草饲料一千八百斤。今年在夏收、秋种、秋收的空隙，各地还连续开展了几次突击打草运动，及早储备过冬饲草，对可作饲料饲草的农副产品也注意收储。巴音郭楞蒙古自治州的有些公社和牧场还准备了大量饲盐、酥油，准备喂养产后的母畜，使之迅速恢复体力，增强哺育能力，提高幼畜成活率。
    各地普遍整修和新建大牲畜过冬的棚圈，争取作到绝大部分牲畜都能在棚舍里过冬。全自治区整修和新建的棚圈目前已达十六万多个
  （包括供小牲畜过冬的）巴音郭楞蒙古自治州今冬新建、改建和补修了棚圈一千多座，这些棚圈都达到了暖和卫生的要求。尼勒克县修建的大棚圈里分成几个小圈分类安置牲畜，便于牲畜管理。
    入冬以来，各地把加强饲养管理、注意劳逸结合，作为大牲畜过冬的重要工作。自治区有关领导部门要求各地严格实行粗料细喂，冬季增加必要的饲养人员，妥善安排大牲畜的使役，力争在今冬到明年春耕前的三四个月内使每头耕畜都能休息两个月，最少一个半月，特别瘦弱的停止使役，让耕畜增强体力。
    本报长春22日电吉林省榆树县建立合理的饲养管理和使役制度，确保大牲畜安全过冬，以迎接明年春耕生产高潮。
    榆树县委首先发动和领导群众大抓防寒设备和饲料贮备工作。到11月末，全县新建起畜舍五千八百多间，占原有畜舍的67％。在饲料的贮备工作上，各公社、管理区、生产队、饲养场，大量地青贮了玉米秸和收集了各种野干草。全县共青贮玉米秸七千八百七十一万斤，野干草五千二百四十三万斤。各生产队还结合打场，收贮了大量各种代用饲料，把豆皮、高粱壳等所有能吃的农副产品全部收了起来，共达四千多万斤。目前，全县每头牲畜平均已有饲料一千七百多斤，加上谷草，可接上明年新草。全县各公社还精打细算安排了饲料，特别是精饲料的合理使用，实行了“牲畜分等、以等定量，落实到畜，分月喂用”的办法。
    各公社还重点加强了弱畜复壮和孕畜的保驹保胎工作。各公社普遍实行了老弱畜、孕畜和壮畜分群分槽分圈饲养；专人饲养专畜；精饲料按定量专用；专人使役；粗料变细料，一切饲料经过粉碎，寸草三铡；各种精料经过炒、温、煮，使生食变熟食，硬食变软食，冷食变热食。同时对老、弱、孕畜实行加草、加料、加盐，增加喂饮遍数，延长吃草时间。对弱畜和孕畜的使役，规定了轻使役或不使役。
    由于采取了这些有效措施，据11月末调查，全县的大牲畜普遍增膘复壮，三类畜由过去占总头数的23％减少到7.6％，二类畜由占26.6％提高到32.7％，一类畜由过去占50.4％提高到59.7％。
    本报讯辽宁省凌源县宋杖子人民公社宋杖子大队，千方百计扩大牲畜饲料来源，同时订出了一年草料早安排的计划，精打细算节约用草，使牲畜饲料由不足变为有余。
    宋杖子生产大队有一千二百一十六头大牲畜，从今年10月到明年9月底需要饲草二百八十一万斤。由于今年连续遭受了各种自然灾害，全大队只能产谷草八十万斤，还缺二百零一万斤。为了解决草料不足的问题，党总支召开了总支会议、群众会、饲养员会，发动大家出主意想办法。大家提出了扩大饲草品种、打搂黄草、实行放牧等办法。结果收集了能代替谷草做饲料的玉米秆、谷荛子、黍秕、豆秕等共一百九十万斤。
    这个大队订出了今后八个月的“一年草料早安排”计划。具体作法是：以畜定量，忙时多吃，闲时少吃，粗细搭配。例如对全大队五百二十三头牛的用草量就作了细致的分配：役牛一年一头用饲草二千五百斤，牧牛八百斤，幼牛五百斤
  （每天最多以十八斤，最少以八斤计算）。在这个用草总数内，规定一类草（谷草）占四分之一，二类草（玉米秕）占四分之二，三类草
  （豆秕和杂草）占四分之一。同时在不超过全年草料定量的范围内，按各个时期、各个阶段、各头牲畜的具体情况进行调剂，使役期多吃，放牧时少吃；农忙多吃，农闲少吃；产孕老病的牲畜多给些细草软草。经过这样精打细算妥善安排以后，全队还可多余七万斤饲草，留作后备。
    为了使计划真正兑现，达到既喂好牲畜又节省饲料的目的，宋杖子大队又实行了专人专畜、草料包干的责任制，分别把责任落实到小队饲养员的身上。还规定了一个月一次的评比检查制度，组织饲养员互相开展竞赛。在每次评比检查中，省饲草并使牲畜增膘的饲养员都得到奖励。
    本报讯辽宁省新金县普兰店镇人民公社庙山大队庙山小队总结了群众喂养牲畜的经验，实行煮草节，软泡料、长草短铡的用草用料方法，节省了大量饲草，又使牲畜增膘。
    这个小队今年共产饲草十一万七千斤，仅够现有五十二头耕畜四个月用，尚缺五个月饲草。在大队党支部的帮助下，这个小队召开群众座谈会，组织有养牲畜经验的人出谋献计。群众共提出了十多条意见，归纳起来就是：煮草节、软泡料、长草短铡，省草增膘。
    小队饲养员杨全林、张玉山认真实行节约饲料的新办法。他们将苞米秸子由过去一刀两寸长，变为寸草三刀。在喂养方法上，实行定食定量，定次数，定喂法：耕牛一天喂三顿，每顿三筛草；早晨、晌午喂干草，吃剩的草节再加水料。最后吃剩的草节，加上少量的食盐，在第二天用锅煮两小时。晚上喂过两次干草后，再喂煮的草节子，吃到大半，再用水料拌一拌，就全部吃光。喂精饲料时，他们改原来的干喂为水喂，先把生料炒七、八分熟，再用磨拉碎，然后用水泡，这样一斤干料可顶二斤。
    这个小队推行了这个办法以后，耕畜由瘦变肥，既省草又省料。马原来每天吃二十斤，现在吃十三斤。耕牛过去每天吃精料一斤，现在每天吃半斤。全队从10月20日到11月20日，就节约玉米秸子四千五百多捆，精料四百五十斤。全队耕畜普遍增膘，五头最瘦弱的老牛也都增了膘。
