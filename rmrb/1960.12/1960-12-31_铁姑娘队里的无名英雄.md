    The Nameless Hero in the Iron Girls Team
    Ji Wen
    Many people know that in the Xiaoyuzhuang Production Team of the Dazhongzhuang Commune in Hangu City, there is an Iron Girls Team that charges forward for large-scale agriculture and grain production, but few people know that there is also a nameless hero in this village – Communist Party member Zhang Qinghe. The commune members affectionately call him the "political commissar" of the Iron Girls Team and a guide for the commune members; the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China praised him as a model Communist Party member.
    Zhang Qinghe is twenty-two years old this year. In his childhood, he followed his parents to escape famine. After liberation, he grew up under the education and cultivation of the Party. Since joining the Communist Party in 1957, he has always taken the lead in responding to the Party's call. When the communization movement arrived in 1958, he led the villagers to join the People's Commune. At that time, Zhang Qinghe and the people of Xiaoyuzhuang made great ambitions to change their poor state through self-reliance. Zhang Qinghe thought: Wang Guofan is a Communist Party member, and I am also a Communist Party member. He promoted the "poor's co-op" spirit, making the entire commune go from poor to rich. Why can't I do it? He made up his mind to resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words, learn from Jianming Cooperative, work hard, and catch up with the rich team within a year!
    Zhang Qinghe felt that Xiaoyuzhuang had little labor force and great difficulties, so it was necessary to give full play to the vanguard role of the Communist Youth League members and the vast number of young people. He gathered six people, including female Communist Youth League members Zhang Xiumin and Zhang Xiuzhen, and young commune members Zhang Qingyun, Zhang Xiuqin, Lu Guiqin, and Shi Xiuqin, to earnestly study and discuss the advanced experience of Jianming Cooperative in turning from poor to rich. After studying, the girls said: "In terms of conditions, we are much better than the original Jianming Cooperative. As long as we have the ambition of the commune members of Jianming Cooperative, we can overcome any difficulty!" They immediately formed the Iron Girls Shock Brigade. Qinghe led this shock brigade and the villagers to fight against numerous difficulties. They lacked livestock and tools for farming. The Iron Girls felt that production was too difficult, and there was no way to engage in sideline occupations. Zhang Qinghe discussed with the Iron Girls: "The commune members of Jianming Cooperative obtained livestock and tools by going up the mountains to collect firewood and reclaiming wasteland. Why can't we cut grass and obtain livestock and tools from the ponds!" He personally led the Iron Girls to cut grass in waist-deep water, cutting more than 30,000 kilograms of grass in more than 20 days, exchanging it for a donkey and a boat. In this way, Zhang Qinghe led the Iron Girls and the villagers to overcome numerous difficulties, reclaimed 56 mu of wasteland, and caught up with the rich team within a year.
    Zhang Qinghe's younger sister, Zhang Xiumin, the captain of the Iron Girls Team, is a girl who loves to talk and laugh. One day, when she came home for lunch, she had a sullen face and was very unhappy. Zhang Qinghe knew at a glance that something was wrong and asked her, "Why are you so unhappy?" Zhang Xiumin said: "Reed roots have grown all over the place. I tried hard to dig for half a day, but I only dug a small area. It's so difficult to dig. When will we be able to reclaim all the wasteland!" Zhang Qinghe said after listening, "How can there be no difficulties in work? If you are scared by difficulties, what kind of revolution is that?" In the afternoon, he went to the fields with the Iron Girls. At that time, Zhang Qinghe was having a headache. He tied a towel around his head, and while working with the girls, he encouraged them: "You see, that's how it is when you work. As long as you work hard, the progress will be fast. Let's have a race and see who digs the fastest!" When the Iron Girls saw that Zhang Qinghe was working like this even when he was sick, they were very moved, and their courage to overcome difficulties was generally enhanced, and they started a wasteland reclamation competition with the male commune members. In four days, they reclaimed one hundred mu of wasteland and planted sorghum.
    Under the education of the Party, Zhang Qinghe understood that to overcome difficulties and continue to move forward, it is necessary to continuously improve the awareness of the commune members. He organized the Iron Girls and all the commune members to study Chairman Mao's works, and he served as the teacher. This was an extremely difficult task for Zhang Qinghe, who was young and had a low level of education. He first improved himself, then armed others, and studied hard, making use of all the gaps in production and work. He did not recognize many characters, so he bought a small dictionary, looked them up while learning, and when he encountered places where the meaning was unclear, he asked the cadres who came to the village to help with the work. After he understood it himself, he connected it with the thoughts and work of the commune members of his team, gave lectures to the Iron Girls and the commune members, and guided them to analyze and understand the problems in their current work based on Chairman Mao's teachings, to improve the awareness of the Iron Girls and the commune members, and to promote the development of the work.
    During the busy farming season in summer, Zhang Qinghe used the opportunity of giving political lessons to the Iron Girls to repeatedly talk about the Party's policy of taking agriculture as the foundation. The Iron Girls and the commune members immediately threw themselves into the activities of rushing to reclaim wasteland and hoeing the fields. Because of the concentrated labor force, coupled with the hard work and clever work of the Iron Girls, although each labor force in the team managed an average of fifty-two mu of land, all crops were managed very well.
    Zhang Qinghe is a member of the Sijiazhuang Management District Party General Branch and the secretary of the Xiaoyuzhuang Production Team Communist Youth League Branch. He is very busy with his work, but he still actively participates in labor with the commune members. In production, he consistently and exemplary abides by labor discipline. Whether he is going out to a meeting or has other things to do, he asks the old captain Zhang Deyong for leave. Zhang Qinghe is also a good secretary to the old captain. The old captain does not recognize many characters. Therefore, whenever the city or commune wants the old captain to attend a meeting, Zhang Qinghe actively prepares materials for him.
    The old captain is Zhang Qinghe's elder, works conscientiously, is willing to work hard, and has experience in growing crops, but he sometimes tends to be anxious. In August of this year, when rushing to plant vegetables, the commune assigned Xiaoyuzhuang the task of planting 25 mu of vegetables. The old captain said: "We don't have so much land, I can't complete this task!" Zhang Qinghe explained with a smile: "Don't worry, old man, let's discuss it slowly." Saying that, he picked up the abacus and said, "You know the bottom line better than I do. You tell me, I'll calculate, and see where we can plant vegetables." The old captain calculated with his fingers that he could plant 26 mu of vegetables. The old captain happily said: "As long as you use your brain more, there is a way." Zhang Qinghe's help made the old captain deeply moved. He said: "Qinghe is not only a good commune member, but also a good cadre, and also my good secretary. I, the captain, will stumble without Qinghe's crutch."
    Zhang Qinghe led the villagers to turn from poor to rich, and in this year's large-scale agriculture and grain production, he created outstanding achievements. However, whenever he reports work to the higher-level Party committee or introduces the situation to people who come to visit, he never talks about himself, always saying that the old captain leads well, the Iron Girls have a high style, and the commune members have sufficient revolutionary drive. When implementing every task of the Party, he always leaves the difficulties to himself and gives the honor to others. The commune members said: "If our village did not have the leadership of the higher-level Party committee, and did not have a good Party member like Qinghe, how could there be an Iron Girls Team, how could there be today's good times!"

    铁姑娘队里的无名英雄
    冀文
    许多人知道汉沽市大钟庄公社小于庄生产队，有一个为大办农业、大办粮食冲锋陷阵的铁姑娘队，可是很少有人知道这村还有一位无名英雄——共产党员张庆贺。社员们亲切地称他是铁姑娘队的“政委”，是社员的带路人；中共唐山市委表扬他是一位模范的共产党员。
    张庆贺今年二十二岁。童年时期随着父母逃荒在外。解放后，在党的教育培养下长大成人，自1957年参加了共产党以后，处处带头，响应党的号召。1958年公社化运动到来时，他带动全村群众参加了人民公社。当时，张庆贺和小于庄的人们，立下雄心大志，决心自力更生改变贫穷面貌。张庆贺心里想：王国藩是共产党员，我也是共产党员，他发扬“穷棒子”精神，使全社由穷变富，我为什么不行呢？他下定决心，坚决听毛主席的话，向建明社学习，发愤图强，在一年内赶上富队！
    张庆贺觉得，小于庄劳力少，困难大，必须充分发挥共青团员和广大青年的突击作用。他把女共青团员张秀敏、张秀珍和青年社员张庆云、张秀琴、卢桂芹、石秀芹等六人召集在一起，认真学习讨论建明社由穷变富的先进经验。学习后，姑娘们说：“论条件，咱们比当初建明社好的多，只要像建明社的社员那样有志气，天大困难也能克服！”当下就组成了铁姑娘突击队。庆贺带领这支突击队和全村群众，向重重困难展开了搏斗。种地缺牲畜，少工具，铁姑娘们感到生产上太困难，搞副业又没门路。张庆贺就和铁姑娘们商量：“建明社社员从上山打柴，向荒山上要来了牲口、工具，我们为什么不可以打草，向水洼要牲畜、工具呢！”他亲自带领铁姑娘们趟着齐腰的水割草，二十多天割草三万多斤，换来了一头毛驴，一只船。张庆贺就这样带动铁姑娘和全村群众，战胜了重重困难，开出了五十六亩荒地，在一年内赶上了富队。
    张庆贺的妹妹——铁姑娘队队长张秀敏，是个爱说爱笑的姑娘。一天，回家吃午饭时，板着面孔，很不高兴。张庆贺一看就知道出了什么问题，问她说：“为什么这么不高兴？”张秀敏说：“芦草根子长了一地，使劲刨半天，才刨不大一片，这么难刨，得啥时候才能把荒地开完哪！”张庆贺听了说：“作工作还能没困难，要是叫困难吓倒，那还叫什么革命呢？”下午，他和铁姑娘们一块下地了。当时，张庆贺正闹头疼，他用手巾把脑袋勒上，和姑娘们一面干着活，一面鼓励她们：“你们看，干活就是这样，只要鼓足干劲，进度就快，咱们赛一赛，看谁刨的快！”铁姑娘们一见张庆贺带着病还这样干，很受感动，普遍增强了战胜困难的勇气，和男社员展开了开荒竞赛。四天就把一百亩荒地开出来了，并且种上了高粱。
    张庆贺在党的教导下，懂得了要克服困难，不断前进，必须不断提高社员群众的觉悟。他组织铁姑娘和全体社员学习毛主席著作，自己担任教员。这对年轻而文化水平又不高的张庆贺来说，是个异常艰巨的任务。他先提高自己，再武装别人，利用一切生产和工作的空隙刻苦学习，有很多字不认识，就买了小字典，边查边学，遇到意思不明白地方，就向来这村帮助工作的干部们请教。自己学通了，就联系本队社员的思想和工作情况，给铁姑娘和社员们讲，并引导她（他）们根据毛主席的教导，来分析认识现时工作中的问题，提高铁姑娘和社员们的觉悟，推动工作的开展。
    夏季农忙时，张庆贺利用给铁姑娘们上政治课的机会，反复地讲了党的以农业为基础的方针，铁姑娘和社员们立即投入了抢荒、锄地活动。由于劳力集中，加上铁姑娘们的苦干巧干，全队虽然每个劳力平均管理五十二亩地，但各项作物都管理得很好。
    张庆贺是司家庄管理区党总支的委员，兼小于庄生产队共青团支部书记，工作很忙，但他仍和社员一起积极参加劳动。生产中，他一贯模范地遵守劳动纪律。无论是到外边开会，还是有别的事情，都向老队长张德永请假。张庆贺还是老队长的一个好秘书。老队长认字不多，因此，一遇到市、公社要老队长去开会，张庆贺就主动地替他准备材料。
    老队长是张庆贺的长辈，工作认真、肯干，种庄稼有经验，就是有时候爱着急。今年8月，抢种蔬菜时，公社分配给小于庄种二十五亩蔬菜的任务。老队长说：“咱们那有这么多地，我没法完成这个任务！”张庆贺笑着解释说：“你老先别着急，咱慢慢商量。”说着抄起算盘说：“你老人家底码比我清，你说着，我算着，看看那里能种菜。”老队长用手指头算计了一气可以种二十六亩菜，老队长高兴地说：“只要多动脑子，就有办法。”张庆贺对老队长的帮助，使老队长深受感动，他说：“庆贺既是好社员，又是好干部，又是我的好秘书，我这个队长离了庆贺这个拐棍就得跌跤。”
    张庆贺带动全村人民由穷变富，并在今年大办农业、大办粮食中，创造了出色的成绩，但是他每逢向上级党委汇报工作，或向参观访问的人们介绍情况时，从不谈论自己，总说老队长领导得好，铁姑娘们风格高，社员们的革命干劲足。在执行党的每一项任务时，总是把困难留给自己，把荣誉让给别人。社员们说：“俺村如果没有上级党委的领导，没有庆贺这样的好党员，怎能有铁姑娘队，怎能有今天的好光景啊！”
