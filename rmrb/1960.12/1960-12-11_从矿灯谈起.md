Starting from Mining Lamps

　　Today, this newspaper published news about the Hebei Province Coal Mine Special Equipment Manufacturing Plant increasing the production of mining lamps. Mining lamps are neither major products like steel and coal, nor are they cutting-edge technology. What is so particularly important about them? However, this seemingly insignificant news raises a very important issue in industrial production, which is that in ensuring key tasks, it is essential to closely grasp all related links, even the small ones.

　　Take mining lamps as an example! This is indeed a very common product. However, without mining lamps, or if the supply of mining lamps is insufficient or not timely, coal production will be affected. It can be seen that although mining lamps are not a key point, they are related to the central link of coal production in current industrial production. In order to grasp the key point of coal production, we must pay attention to all links like mining lamps that are closely related to guaranteeing the key point.

　　The impact of mining lamps on coal production reflects that no key point is isolated; it has one kind of inner connection or another with the surrounding things. If this connection is not seen, and the key point is isolated, even if forces are concentrated, the key point cannot still be guaranteed. The connection between the key point and all the links related to the key point is an objective law of economic work. To produce coal, mining lamps must be produced; with the host machine, there must be accessories; once the equipment is manufactured, it must be maintained and repaired. There is a certain proportional relationship between coal and mining lamps, between the host machine and accessories, and between equipment manufacturing strength and maintenance and repair strength. This proportional relationship is an objective law of economic work. Making economic work more and more meticulous means that we must more and more consciously grasp the objective laws of economic work and comprehensively arrange the proportional relationships in all aspects.

　　Ensuring the key point requires attention to all links related to the key point. As a working method, it is the "playing the piano" working method mentioned by Comrade Mao Zedong. As a way of thinking, it is the comprehensive viewpoint that our Party has consistently emphasized must be had in doing any work. To learn the "playing the piano" working method, one must first establish a comprehensive viewpoint. Why can some people learn the "playing the piano" working method, while others cannot? The reason is that some people have established a comprehensive viewpoint, while others have not. Failing to grasp the main contradiction and having no key point is incompleteness; only grasping the key point and dropping the general is also incompleteness; only grasping the key point and not grasping all the links related to the key point is also a kind of incompleteness. Both ensuring the key point and taking care of the general; both grasping the key point and also grasping all the links related to the key point - this is our comprehensive view of the key point. With this comprehensive viewpoint and having learned the "playing the piano" working method, the key point can be guaranteed.

　　There are many other links related to the key point similar to the production of mining lamps, and it is necessary to draw everyone's attention to them and seriously check and arrange them. Now is the time to make a final effort to complete and over fulfill this year's industrial production plan, and also the time to arrange next year's industrial production. We must implement the policy of concentrating forces to ensure the key point; in order to ensure the key point, we must do a good job in all aspects related to the key point.

### 从矿灯谈起

    从矿灯谈起
    今天本报发表了河北省煤矿专用设备制造厂增产矿灯的新闻。矿灯既非钢铁煤炭一类的主要产品，又不是什么尖端技术，有什么特别重要的呢？然而，正是这条看起来无关紧要的新闻，却提出了工业生产中一个很重要的问题，这就是保证重点一定要抓紧同重点有关的各个环节，哪怕是一些细小的环节。
    就拿矿灯来说吧！这确实是一种很普通的产品。然而，没有矿灯，或者矿灯供应不充足、不及时，煤炭生产就会受到影响。可见，矿灯虽不是什么重点，却同煤炭生产这一当前工业生产的中心环节有着一定的联系。为了抓好煤炭生产这个重点，就要注意到矿灯这一类同保证重点大有关系的各个环节。
    矿灯对于煤炭生产的这种影响，反映了任何重点都不是孤立的，它同周围的事物有着这样或那样的内在联系。看不到这种联系，把重点孤立起来，即便是集中了力量，仍然不能保证重点。重点和同重点有关的各个环节之间的联系，是经济工作的客观规律。要生产煤炭，就要生产矿灯；有了主机，就要有配件；设备制造出来了，就要进行维护检修。煤炭同矿灯之间、主机和配件之间、设备制造力量和维护检修力量之间，都有一定的比例关系。这种比例关系，是经济工作的客观规律。经济工作要越做越细致，就是要我们越来越自觉地掌握经济工作的客观规律，全面安排各方面的比例关系。
    保证重点一定要注意同重点有关的各个环节，作为一种工作方法来说，是毛泽东同志所说的“弹钢琴”的工作方法，作为一种思想方法来说，是我们党一贯强调做任何工作都必须要有的全面观点。要学会“弹钢琴”的工作方法，必先树立全面观点。为什么有人学会了“弹钢琴”的工作方法，有人学不会“弹钢琴”的工作方法呢？原因就在于有人树立起全面观点，有人还没有树立起全面观点。抓不住主要矛盾，没有重点，这是不全面；只抓重点，丢掉一般，也是不全面；只抓重点，不抓同重点有关的各个环节，又是一种不全面。既保证重点，又照顾一般；既抓住重点，还抓住同重点有关的各个环节，这就是我们对待重点的全面观点。有了这种全面观点，学会了“弹钢琴”的工作方法，重点才有保证。
    类似矿灯生产这种同重点有关的环节还有不少，有必要引起大家注意，认真检查和安排。现在正是作最后的努力完成和超额完成今年的工业生产计划的时候，也是安排明年的工业生产的时候。我们一定要贯彻集中力量保证重点的方针；为了保证重点，一定要做好同重点有关的各个环节的工作。
