This method can be summarized in six characters: learn, lead, grasp, plan, associate, and do. Because they are good at helping grassroots cadres study policies, training apprentices at every level, meticulously arranging production and life, offering ideas and finding solutions, and making close friends, and personally participating in production, the style of grassroots cadres has improved, and they themselves have also improved. They said: This is how we found the key to doing a good job!
