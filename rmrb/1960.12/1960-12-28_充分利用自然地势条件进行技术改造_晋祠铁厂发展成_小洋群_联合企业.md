Taiyuan, December 27th (report from this newspaper) - Jinci Iron Factory in Taiyuan has fully utilized natural topographical conditions for technical transformation, saving manpower and increasing production. The pig iron production in November increased by 3.44% compared to October, and in the first half of December, it increased by another 3.1% compared to the same period in November. The pig iron qualification rate reached 100%, and the production of steelmaking and rolled steel has already begun.

Jinci Iron Factory was born during the Great Leap Forward for Steel in 1958. By the end of last year, it had developed into a "small foreign group" iron smelting plant. In order to ensure sustained and continuous progress in production, the Party Committee of this factory decided at the beginning of this year to transform the single iron smelting "small foreign group" into a "small foreign group" combined enterprise integrating iron smelting, steelmaking, and steel rolling. The entire factory's staff focused on both production and technical transformation. In just seven months, they completed the transition to a "small foreign group" combined enterprise. The biggest characteristic of this "small foreign group" combined enterprise is that it utilizes the topographical height difference, adopts a stepped layout, and places the mining, washing, iron smelting, steelmaking, and steel rolling workshops on five steps with different elevations. Each workshop is interconnected. From raw material crushing through washing, iron smelting, steelmaking, to steel rolling, the entire production process implements stepped gravity flow, forming a production line running from top to bottom. This approach has shown many advantages. By utilizing the high potential difference, molten iron can directly enter the converter without passing through an iron melting furnace, thereby reducing the ingot casting and iron melting processes, lowering iron consumption, and increasing steel production. Due to the reduction of the iron melting process, the heat source is fully utilized, greatly saving fuel. According to calculations, a minimum of 540 kilograms of coke can be saved for smelting one ton of steel. By utilizing the weight of objects and stepped gravity flow, processes and labor are greatly reduced. The entire factory has saved a total of 124 workers, who have been assigned to other newly built units. In addition, secondary handling and lifting and transportation equipment have also been greatly reduced.

    充分利用自然地势条件进行技术改造
    晋祠铁厂发展成“小洋群”联合企业
    本报太原27日电　太原晋祠铁厂充分利用自然地势条件，进行技术改造，节约了人力，提高了产量。11月份的生铁产量比10月份提高了3.44％，12月上半月又比11月同期提高了3.1％，生铁合格率达到百分之百，并已开始了炼钢、轧材的生产。
    晋祠铁厂是在1958年大炼钢铁运动中诞生的。到去年年底，已经发展成“小洋群”炼铁厂。为了保证生产持续跃进，今年年初，这个厂党委会决定变单一的炼铁“小洋群”为从炼铁到炼钢、轧钢的“小洋群”联合企业。全厂职工一手抓生产，一手抓技术改造，仅仅用了七个月的时间，就完成了向“小洋群”联合企业的过渡。这个“小洋群”联合企业的最大特点，是利用地形高差，采用阶梯形的布置，把采矿、洗选、炼铁、炼钢、轧钢车间，设在标高不同的五个阶梯上，各个车间互相衔接，从原料破碎经过洗选、炼铁、炼钢到轧钢，全部生产过程实行阶梯自流，形成自上而下一条龙的生产流水线。这种作法显示出了多方面的优越性。利用高位差，炼铁后不经过化铁炉，铁水可直接进入转炉，这样就减少了铸锭、化铁工序，降低了铁耗，增加了钢铁产量。由于减少了化铁工序，使热源得到了充分利用，大大节约了燃料。据计算，炼一吨钢最少能节省五百四十公斤焦炭。由于利用了物体自重，阶梯自流，工序和劳力大大减少，全厂共节约出一百二十四名工人，补充到其他新建单位。此外，还大大减少了二次搬运和起重、运输等设备。
