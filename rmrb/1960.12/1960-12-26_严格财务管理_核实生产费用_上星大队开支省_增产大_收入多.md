(Report from our Guangzhou Bureau on the 25th) The Shangxing Brigade of the Shajing Commune in Bao'an County, Guangdong, has strengthened production planning and established a strict financial management system. As a result, its production cost expenditures this year have decreased by 15.8% compared to last year, and administrative management expenses account for only 0.36% of total income. While ensuring increased production and income, 68.5% of the total income is distributed to the commune members, ensuring that 98% of the commune members increase their income.

Since communization, the Shangxing Brigade has experienced consecutive years of increased production and income. However, due to the failure of some cadres to establish the concept of running the commune diligently and thriftily, production increased significantly in the previous two years, but the income of commune members did not increase much. To change this situation, this spring, the brigade formulated a year-round revenue and expenditure plan based on the principle of diligence and thrift. At the same time, in the spirit of not spending a penny that shouldn't be spent and spending as little as possible on what should be spent, it established a strict financial management system. The expenditure plan formulated by the brigade (with quarterly and monthly revenue and expenditure sub-plans) is publicized to the masses. Under the premise of "three guarantees" and "four fixings," it is stipulated that the production cost of rice should not exceed 15% for small teams, and that of cash crops should not exceed 20%; management expenses should not exceed 0.4% of total income. Agricultural production costs are calculated based on the contracted area of each small team and contracted to the small teams, with settlement at the end of the year: the excess is the responsibility of the small team; the surplus is used by the small team to expand reproduction. All farm tools in the team are thoroughly cleaned up, classified into three categories (large, medium, and small), registered, and generally fixed for use by the small teams. Small farm tools are kept and used by commune members privately. The brigade stipulates a farm tool repair fee of five jiao per mu of cultivated land based on the area of each small team, which is contracted to the small team for its own management. The above regulations are stipulated in a contract signed by the brigade and the small teams for effective implementation, summarized once a month, and publicized to the masses. At the same time, it is also stipulated that expenditures of more than ten yuan must be approved by the financial captain, more than twenty yuan must be approved by the party branch secretary, more than fifty yuan must be reviewed and approved by the brigade management committee, and more than one hundred yuan must be discussed and approved by the commune member representative assembly.

Last year, the Shangxing Brigade's farm tool purchase and repair expenses reached more than six thousand yuan. This year, the original farm tool factory was rectified, and ten experienced and skilled commune members were designated to be responsible for felling trees, collecting rattan, and cutting hemp in the deep mountains and remote areas to make and repair oxcarts, handcarts, manure baskets, water buckets, plows, and harrows. This year, during the autumn harvest, there was a temporary shortage of grain baskets, and there was no bamboo nearby, and the market supply was limited. The farm tool factory sent five people to cut bamboo in the mountains more than ten li away, and the small teams also found a batch of broken baskets to repair, which solved the problem of insufficient tools for the autumn harvest. This year, the Shangxing Brigade made and repaired more than 1,700 farm tools. In addition to spending 550 yuan on some necessary raw materials, all other raw materials were self-sufficient, reducing expenditures by more than 5,000 yuan compared to last year, and the supply of farm tools was also more timely and sufficient than in previous years. Fertilizer and seeds have always been the largest items in cost expenditures. This year, each small team solved the problem according to the characteristics of its own land. The second small team had a piece of sandy, shallow, and barren land that had always relied on commercial fertilizer in the past. This year, green manure was planted early, and most of it was applied as base fertilizer before transplanting the rice seedlings. After transplanting, garbage mud and pig and cattle manure were mixed and applied, and as a result, no cash was spent on buying fertilizer. In the past, all seedlings of cash crops other than rice were purchased from other places. This year, at the beginning, each team planned the seed retention fields for various cash crops, which were not only completely self-sufficient but also had a surplus.

Because there is a strict expenditure plan, and large expenditures are reviewed and approved by the masses, many expenses can be saved. For example, the first small team originally did not have a dining hall and asked the brigade to allocate funds to buy wood and cement. When this plan was submitted to the commune member representative assembly for discussion, everyone decided to vacate a public house for storing farm tools and sundries and buy a small amount of old wood and lime to convert the house into a dining hall. Adding another kitchen cost a total of 144 yuan, saving more than 800 yuan compared to the original plan.

    严格财务管理　核实生产费用
    上星大队开支省　增产大　收入多
    本报广州25日电　广东宝安县沙井公社上星大队，加强生产计划性，建立严格的财务管理制度，使今年的生产成本开支比去年降低15.8％，行政管理费的开支仅占总收入的0.36％，保证获得增产增收的同时，把占总收入的68.5％分配给社员，做到了98％的社员增加收入。
    上星大队公社化以来连年增产增收，但由于部分干部没有树立勤俭办社的观点，致使前两年增产不少，但社员收入增加不多。为了改变这种情况，今年春天，大队按照勤俭的原则，认真制定了全年的收支计划；同时本着不该花的钱一分不花，该花的钱尽量少花的精神，建立了一套严格的财务管理制度。大队制定的开支计划（每季、每月还订收支小计划），向群众公布。在“三包”“四固定”的前提下，规定小队生产水稻成本不超过15％，经济作物不超过20％；管理费用则不超过总收入的0.4％。农业生产按各小队的包产面积计算成本，包给小队，年终结算：超过部分归小队负责；节余部分归小队用于扩大再生产。全队农具全面进行清理，分别大、中、小三种，造册登记，一般固定给小队使用，小件农具由社员私人保管使用。大队按各小队面积，规定每亩耕地的农具修理费为五角，包给小队自行掌握。上述规定，由大队和小队签订合同，切实执行，每月总结一次，向群众公布。同时还规定十元以上的开支权经财经队长批准，二十元以上经党总支书记批准，五十元以上经大队管理委员会审查批准，一百元以上经社员代表大会讨论通过。
    去年，上星大队的农具添置、修配费用达六千多元，今年将原来的农具厂加以整顿，指定十个有经验、有技术的社员专门负责，到深山野岭伐木、采藤、刈麻，自制和修理牛车、手推车、粪箕、水桶、犁耙等。今年秋收时，谷箩临时不够用，附近又无竹子，市场货源又少，农具厂就派出五个人到十多里路以外的大山砍竹，各小队也找出一批烂箩加以修理，就解决了秋收的工具不足问题。今年，上星大队自制和修理农具一千七百多件，除了添置一些必要的原料花了五百五十元外，其余原料全部自给，比去年减少开支五千多元，农具供应也比往年应时充足。肥料和种子是历年来成本开支最大的项目，今年各小队都根据自己土地特点自行解决。第二小队有一片沙质浅脚瘦田，过去一向依赖商品肥，今年及早种了绿肥，在插秧前就施下大部分作基肥，插秧后又混和垃圾泥和猪牛粪施下，结果没有开支现款买肥料。过去除水稻以外，经济作物的种苗全部由外地购入，今年各队一开始就把各种经济作物的留种田都规划好，不但全部自给，而且有余。
    由于有了严格的开支计划，大笔开支经过群众审查批准，使很多费用都能够节省下来。例如第一小队原来没有饭厅，要求大队拨款买木料、买水泥。这个计划提交给社员代表大会讨论时，大家决定将一座堆放农具和杂物的公房腾出来，买少量旧木料和石灰，将这座房子改建成饭厅，加上另建一个厨房，共花了一百四十四元，比原计划节省了八百多元。
