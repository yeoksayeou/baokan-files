    A Year of Overt and Covert Struggles
    Yan Biao

    In these days nearing the year's end, the weather in London is truly bleak, with bitter winds and heavy rain, a sky full of gloom. And the entire situation of Western imperialism is much the same as the weather in London. The first year of the 1960s saw the fourth post-war economic crisis in the United States. The development of the American crisis led to a decline in the United States' "leadership" position in the West, further intensifying contradictions among imperialists. The complex four-way struggle among the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany permeated the entire year of 1960 and is intensifying. This cannot be concealed by all the beautiful rhetoric about "Western unity."

    The Farce of the "God of Wealth" Begging for Money

    At the end of November this year, the Western world staged a farce in which the American "God of Wealth" went around begging for money with a hat. The actors in this play, U.S. Treasury Secretary Anderson and Undersecretary of State Dillon, toured Bonn, Paris, and London, demanding that allies—especially West Germany—put up money to help the United States overcome the crisis. In this play, the four parties displayed their respective abilities, deceiving and scheming against each other, each trying to sacrifice the others to protect themselves, fully demonstrating the essence of the so-called Western alliance, which is based on the predatory nature of imperialism and conflicting interests. Although the United States used various means of pressure and blackmail, West Germany refused the U.S. request to pay $600 million in occupation costs. The two U.S. envoys returned empty-handed, disappointed.

    The failure of Anderson and Dillon's mission to Europe reflects the changing trends in the balance of power in the Western imperialist competition: the United States is declining in political status due to the weakening of its economic power; on the other hand, West Germany's position has relatively strengthened. The West German monopoly capital, nurtured by the United States, is no longer so obedient to the United States. This cannot but sadden the United States and amuse Britain and France. Of course, because West Germany still relies heavily on U.S. support, this struggle has not yet fully reached a fever pitch.

    The Crisis Shakes the "Dollar Diplomacy"

    The third post-war economic crisis in the United States in 1957-1958 had just passed, and after only a little over a year, the United States entered its fourth economic crisis this year. This crisis did not occur after a period of cyclical economic boom, but before the wounds of the last crisis had fully healed, and this crisis was also a complication, with both overproduction and an international payments crisis occurring simultaneously, making this crisis more serious than the last. At present, production in the United States is declining, the steel industry is operating far below capacity, the unemployed population has reached 4.5 million, and it is estimated that it will break the 6 million mark. At the same time, the international balance of payments deficit is accumulating, and gold is flowing out in torrents. This puts the United States in an inescapable contradiction. To stimulate the rise of the domestic economy, it is necessary to step up arms expansion and war preparations, expand outwards, lower interest rates, relax credit, and so on. But the result of doing so is to cause a massive outflow of gold, a decline in currency value, and a serious deterioration in the international balance of payments. The London *Economist*, in commenting on the special dangers of the U.S. crisis, wrote: The United States may become the first country since the war to face the contradiction feared by the famous bourgeois economist Keynes, namely, the simultaneous occurrence of external payments deficits and domestic economic recession.

    American diplomacy has always been called "dollar diplomacy," which means that the United States' foreign aggressive policy is largely supported by its dollars. U.S. President-elect Kennedy's economic advisor, Galbraith, once admitted: "To be fair, our foreign policy has always relied less on the skills of our diplomats, or on our Secretary of State, and more on our ability to support it with money." Now that dollars are in short supply, the United States is encountering many difficulties in promoting its foreign expansionist policy. This is precisely what the U.S. ruling group is worried about.

    The Re-emergence of West Germany

    With the relative weakening of the political and economic power of the United States, it has become difficult to control its "allies" in some respects, leaving a so-called "leadership vacuum" in Western Europe. In order to "fill the vacuum," dazzling struggles have unfolded on the Western European political stage. Britain, France, West Germany, and other imperialist countries, proceeding from their respective interests, have engaged in various alliances and oppositions, sometimes uniting with one to suppress the other, and sometimes uniting with the other to suppress the one, in order to attack opponents and strengthen their own position. In this struggle, the growth of West Germany's power is an increasingly important factor.

    Due to the vigorous support of the United States, the concentration of West German monopoly capital exceeding that of Britain and France, and many other factors such as its cheap labor force, the West German economy has developed rapidly after the war. West German industrial production already surpassed that of Britain in 1958, and was almost twice that of France. In terms of export trade, West German industrial exports accounted for more than 19% of the total value of industrial exports in the capitalist world last year, while Britain only accounted for slightly more than 16%. West German foreign investment increased sharply from 27 million West German marks in 1952 to 2.3 billion West German marks in 1959. Gold and foreign exchange reserves currently amount to as high as $7 billion, second only to the United States, and far exceeding those of Britain and France. In the military field, West Germany is stepping up its nuclear armament and striving to restore its position as a military power.

    With the gradual increase in West Germany's strength, its political situation, which is restricted by international treaties and forced to occupy the status of a second-rate country, is increasingly in contradiction with its economic status as a first-rate country. Therefore, for a long time, West Germany has been striving to break through restrictions and overthrow the current balance of power. This makes this up-and-coming imperialist country particularly fierce in its struggle with other imperialist countries for hegemony. In this struggle, the policy of the Adenauer group is: to rely closely on the support of the United States, to rely on strong economic power, to strive for military and political hegemony, to form a Western European political and economic "unity" with West Germany as the core, in order to change the current balance of power in Europe, make a comeback, and realize the German imperialist ambition of dominating Europe for a century. To this end, West Germany, on the one hand, insists on opposing East-West negotiations, strives to maintain international tension, in order to collude with the United States and accelerate the pace of rearmament; on the other hand, it vigorously prevents Britain and France from approaching, drags France down, and forms a "Paris-Bonn axis" with the "Common Market" of six countries as its economic foundation, squeezing out British forces on the European continent. The "Six" and "Seven" Dispute Remains Unresolved

    The struggle between the "Common Market" of six countries, led by West Germany and France, and the European "Free Trade Area" of seven countries, led by Britain, has been going on for a year and remains unresolved. The formation of the "Common Market" of six countries, with a population of more than 160 million, is a serious blow to Britain. In order to counter the "Common Market," Britain took the lead in organizing the seven-nation free trade area. But in all respects, the "Seven" are no match for the "Six." For a year, British newspapers have been constantly talking about whether the "Six" and "Seven" should "unite" or reach some kind of "understanding." But the actual situation is the opposite. The two groups are going their separate ways, moving further and further apart, and the division of Western Europe is becoming increasingly obvious. The struggle between the two sides was once intensified in March this year after the six-nation group put forward the so-called "Hallstein Plan" to accelerate the economic merger of the "Common Market."

    On the balance of power between the "Six" and "Seven," the addition of the United States' weight is now tipping the balance even more in favor of the side unfavorable to Britain. The United States has always attempted to support a Western European political, economic, and military group with West Germany as its core. In addition, U.S. monopoly capital's investment in Britain has approached saturation, while the six-nation market, with its vast market, large population, and cheap labor force, is precisely the best investment target. Therefore, even aside from political factors, on this point alone, the United States is willing to support the six-nation group more and show indifference to the seven-nation group. On the one hand, the United States does not want the "Six" and "Seven" to become too divided, thereby undermining the overall situation of "Western unity" and hindering U.S. control over the whole of Western Europe; on the other hand, it does not want the two groups to truly unite and jointly deal with the United States. The United States wants to use this situation to separately pressure Western Europe to make concessions to the United States.

    Economic Warfare Leads to Political Division

    The political struggle between Britain, France, and West Germany is a concentrated reflection of the deadly economic competition. Conversely, the confrontation between the two economic groups has become a battleground for political hegemony between the two sides. The increasingly declining British Empire is facing the danger of being squeezed out of the Western European continent and becoming an isolated "overseas island." And Britain's policy has always been to rely on the special relationship with Western Europe and the two traditional links of the overseas Commonwealth system as bargaining chips to bargain with the United States and sit in the second seat in the Western world. Therefore, doing everything possible to break up the alliance between France and West Germany and maintaining Britain's influence on the mainland has become Britain's top priority. When de Gaulle visited London this year, the British government welcomed him with the most solemn etiquette for a foreign head of state since the war. In the negotiations, Britain expressed its willingness to implement a political truce with France in Africa and no longer oppose France becoming a nuclear power, etc., in exchange for French concessions. However, subsequent facts showed that all of this had little effect. Because de Gaulle is currently attempting to rely on West Germany and the "Common Market" to enhance its status as a major power, France has become the most stubborn opponent of "reconciliation" between the "Six" and "Seven."

    After failing to win over France, Britain turned to focusing more on winning over West Germany, in order to "bridge" the "Six" and "Seven," break into the Western European continent's front line, disintegrate the "Common Market" and the "Paris-Bonn axis" from within, and realize its dream of a European "Greater Free Trade Area." Therefore, for a considerable period of time, Britain's attitude towards West Germany has improved compared to the past.

    From West Germany's point of view, its contradictions with Britain are extremely profound. One of the purposes of forming an alliance with France is to counter Britain, but in recent years, because France has attempted to act as the leader of Western Europe, this has led to the development of contradictions between the "Paris-Bonn axis." In the recent meeting between Adenauer and de Gaulle, de Gaulle put forward the so-called "European Political Unification Plan." This plan would make France the spokesperson for a "Third Western European Force" that could rival the United States and Britain in the North Atlantic Group. This "European Political Unification" led by France is naturally not only disliked by the United States, but also does not suit West Germany's tastes. Therefore, Adenauer needs to make some gestures towards Britain in order to restrain de Gaulle's ambition to be the leader of Western Europe. At the same time, Adenauer needs Britain's support on the German and West Berlin issues, and on the issue of West German nuclear armament. Making some economic concessions in exchange for British political concessions is worthwhile for West Germany. Therefore, recently West German newspapers have also been advocating the necessity of "reconciliation" between the "Six" and "Seven." For the sake of temporary mutual utilization, Britain and West Germany, the two protagonists in the struggle for European hegemony, have suddenly become "affectionate."

    But this is not enough to eliminate the contradictions between the two groups. Even British officials and public opinion admit that there is no "magical" reconciliation plan in sight. The current trend is to rectify their respective internal affairs, strengthen their strength, and prepare for the next stage of the struggle, but without closing the door completely, leaving some room for maneuver. But they still do not give up the opportunity to damage each other. For example, recently, when the United States coerced West Germany to put up money to solve the dollar crisis and was rejected, Britain also tried its best to attack West Germany and alienate the relationship between the United States and West Germany. If the contradictions between the United States and Britain are the main contradiction in the entire imperialist camp, then, in the long run, the contradictions between Britain and West Germany are the main contradiction in Western Europe.

    The Struggle Between Control and Counter-Control

    At a time when the complex contradictions between Western European imperialist countries are causing a great deal of trouble, the struggle between the United States and its Western European "allies" for control and counter-control is also unfolding fiercely.

    The current policy of the United States is to combine easing the crisis with strengthening control over its allies. The United States is attempting to strengthen the "centralized leadership" and "direct leadership" of the West. In the military field, it is using the "integration" plan to "unify" the military forces of "allies" under the "command" of the United States. In the economic field, it is trying to shift the crisis to protect itself. In this regard, the United States is using the situation of sabotaging the four-power summit to tie "allies" to the U.S. chariot by "dealing with the Soviet threat," and on the other hand, it is retreating in order to advance, using the empty name of sharing "control" of some nuclear weapons with "allies" to induce Britain and France to abandon their own "independent nuclear forces" and submit to the will of the United States. But all of this has been resisted by Britain and France.

    In terms of economics and foreign "aid," the "Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development" recently established by the United States, also reflects the contradictions between the United States and Western European countries in economic struggle and the issue of "aid" (that is, control) to underdeveloped countries. The United States is attempting to use this organization to control Western Europe's economic policies on the one hand, and on the other hand, to pressure Western European countries to contribute more money to share the foreign "aid" controlled by the United States. This has once again aroused a struggle for control and counter-control in the economic field. For example, West German monopoly capital is stepping up its foreign expansion, using "aid" as a pretext to carry out capital exports to Asian, African, and Latin American countries. However, it prefers to act alone rather than incorporate foreign "aid" into the U.S. orbit and hand it over to U.S. control. Britain is also wary of the United States' actions. The London *Times*, in commenting on the newly established "Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development," hinted in a subtle tone that the mutual relationship between the United States and Western Europe is already different from that in the early post-war period. At that time, the United States was the "aid giver" and Western Europe was the "aid recipient"; now the United States itself is in financial and economic difficulty and needs others to help. Therefore, it is best to have more "mutual consultation" in this organization.

    With the weakening of the United States' "leadership," the "allies" are now also stirring. Britain is taking advantage of the opportunity of a gap in U.S. diplomacy during the transition between the old and new governments to try to make a comeback and seize the initiative in Western diplomacy. There are reports that British Prime Minister Macmillan is preparing to launch a series of diplomatic activities next year, including meetings with the new U.S. President Kennedy, meetings with Adenauer, and holding a Commonwealth Conference. Some people in Britain say that Macmillan is going to show Kennedy some color. This will inevitably cause another quarrel in the imperialist camp.

    1960 is coming to an end. As we mutually congratulate each other on the "Leap Forward Year" and the "Year of Unity," the West is experiencing a "Year of Regression" and a "Year of Contradiction." This year's overt and covert struggles have not yet ended, and more intense contradictions and more complex alliances and oppositions will unfold next year. (Attached picture)

    明争暗斗又一年
    言彪
    在接近年终的这些日子里，伦敦的天气真个是凄风苦雨、愁云惨雾。而整个西方帝国主义的处境，也正和伦敦的天气差不多。六十年代的第一年，就出现了战后美国第四次经济危机。美国危机的发展引起美国在西方“领导”地位的下降，使帝国主义之间的矛盾进一步加深。美、英、法、西德之间错综复杂的四角斗争，贯串着整个1960年，而且正在越演越烈。这是一切关于“西方团结”的漂亮辞令所掩盖不住的。
    “财神”讨钱的丑剧
    今年11月底，西方世界上演了一出美国“财神”拿着帽子向人讨钱的丑剧。这出戏的演员、美国财政部长安德逊和副国务卿狄龙，周游波恩、巴黎和伦敦，要求盟友们——特别是西德，拿出钱来救济美国，渡过危机。在这场戏里，四方面各显神通，尔虞我诈，勾心斗角，以图牺牲别人，保全自己，充分表现出在帝国主义掠夺本性和相互利害冲突的基础上建立起来的所谓西方联盟的实质。虽然美国使用了种种压力和敲诈勒索的手段，西德还是拒绝了美国要它支付六亿美元占领军费用的要求。两位美国特使两手空空，败兴而归。
    安德逊和狄龙赴欧使命的失败，反映出西方帝国主义角逐过程中力量对比变化的趋势：美国由于经济力量削弱，政治地位也在下降；另一方面，西德的地位则相对有所加强。美国一手扶植起来的西德垄断资本，已经对美国不那样百依百顺了。这不能不使美国伤心，为英法窃笑。当然，由于西德还有赖美国的大力支持，这种斗争暂时还未完全白热化。
    危机动摇了“金元外交”
    1957—1958年的美国战后第三次经济危机刚刚过去，相隔不过一年多，美国又于今年进入第四次经济危机。这次危机不是发生在周期性经济高涨之后而是发生在上次危机创伤尚未完全复原之前，而且这次危机还是一次并发症，生产过剩和国际支付危机同时到来，这就使这次危机比上次更加严重。目前美国生产下降，钢铁业开工率严重不足，失业人口达四百五十万人，而且估计将破六百万大关。与此同时，国际收支逆差累累黄金滚滚外流。这就使美国陷入一个无法解脱的矛盾中。要刺激国内经济上升，就要加紧扩军备战，对外扩张，对内降低利率、放宽信贷等等。而这样做的结果就更引起黄金大量外流，币值降低，国际收支严重恶化。伦敦《经济学家》在评论美国危机的特殊危险性时写道：美国可能成为战后第一个国家面临著名资产阶级经济学家凯恩斯所害怕的矛盾，即对外收支亏损和国内经济衰退同时并发的矛盾。
    美国的外交一向称为“金元外交”，这就是说，美国的对外侵略政策在很大程度上是靠它的金元来支撑的。美国当选总统肯尼迪的经济顾问加耳布莱斯曾供认：“公平地说，我们的外交政策一向较少地依靠我们的外交人员的技术，或者是依靠我们的国务卿的，而是较多地依靠我们需要以金钱来支持它的能力”。现在，金元短拙，美国要推行其对外扩张的外交政策也就遇到了不少的困难。这也正是美国统治集团所担忧的。
    西德的再起
    随着美国政治、经济力量的相对削弱，已在某些方面难于驾驭其“盟国”，使西欧出现了所谓“领导真空”。为了“填补真空”，西欧政治舞台上展开了令人眼花缭乱的斗争。英、法、西德等几个帝国主义国家，从各自的利益出发，纵横捭阖，时而联此抑彼，时而联彼抑此，以期打击对手，加强自己地位。在这场斗争中，西德力量的增长，是一个越来越重要的因素。
    由于美国的大力扶植，由于西德垄断资本的集中程度超过英、法等国，再加上它的劳动力低廉等许多因素，西德的经济在战后发展很快。西德的工业生产早在1958年即已超过英国，比法国几乎多一倍。在出口贸易上，去年西德工业品出口在资本主义世界工业品出口总值中已占19％强，而英国只占16％强。西德对外投资从1952年的二千七百万西德马克激增为1959年的二十三亿西德马克。黄金外汇储备在目前更高达七十亿美元，仅次于美国，大大超过英、法。在军事方面，西德正加紧原子武装并力图恢复军事强国的地位。
    随着西德实力的逐渐增强，它在政治上由于国际条约束缚而不得不居于二等国地位的情况也越来越同经济上头等国地位相矛盾。因此长时期来，西德力图冲破限制，推翻目前的力量均势。这就使这个后起的帝国主义国家在同其他帝国主义国家争夺霸权斗争中，特别凶狠。在这场斗争中，阿登纳集团的政策是：紧紧依靠美国的支持，凭借雄厚的经济力量，争取军事上和政治上的霸权，结成以西德为核心的西欧政治经济“统一体”，以改变目前欧洲的力量均势，卷土重来，实现德国帝国主义一世纪来独霸欧洲的野心。为此，西德一方面坚持反对东西方谈判，力谋维持国际紧张局势，以便同美国勾结一起，加速重新武装的步调；另一方面大力阻止英法接近，拖住法国，结成以六国“共同市场”为其经济基础的“巴黎—波恩轴心”，排挤掉英国在西欧大陆的势力。“六”“七”之争未可开交
    以西德和法国为首的六国“共同市场”，与英国领导的七国欧洲“自由贸易区”之间的斗争，闹了一年，仍然未可开交。拥有人口一亿六千多万的六国“共同市场”的形成，对英国是一个严重打击。为了对抗“共同市场”，英国带头组织了七国自由贸易区。但从各方面来说，“七国”都不是“六国”的对手。一年来，英国报刊不断谈论着“六国”、“七国”之间是否“联合”起来或达成某种“谅解”的问题。但实际情况却与此相反。两个集团分道扬镳，越走越远，西欧的分裂越来越明显。在今年3月间六国集团提出加速实现“共同市场”经济合并的所谓“哈尔斯坦计划”之后，双方的斗争曾一度尖锐化
    在“六国”、“七国”对峙的天平上，目前由于加上美国的法码，就更加向不利于英国的方面倾斜。美国一向企图扶植一个以西德为核心的西欧政治、经济、军事集团。此外，美国垄断资本对英国的投资已经接近饱和，而市场广大、人口众多、劳动力低廉的六国市场，却正是最好的投资对象。因此，即使撇开政治上的因素不谈，就在这一点上，美国也愿意更多地支持六国集团，对七国集团表示冷淡。美国一方面不愿意“六国”、“七国”之间过于决裂，从而有损“西方团结”的大局，阻碍美国对整个西欧的控制，另一方面也不愿意两个集团真正联合起来共同对付美国。美国正是要利用这种局面，分别压迫西欧对美国作出让步。
    经济战引起政治分裂
    英、法、西德之间的政治斗争，正是致命的经济竞争的集中反映。反过来说，两个经济集团的对峙，又成为双方政治争霸的阵地。日益衰落的英帝国，正面临着被排挤出西欧大陆，变成孤立的“海外岛屿”的危险。而英国的政策一向在于依靠和西欧的特殊关系和海外联邦体系这两条传统纽带作为对美国讨价还价，在西方世界坐第二把交椅的本钱。因此，千方百计拆散法国和西德的联盟，保持英国在大陆上的影响，就成为英国的当务之急。在戴高乐今年访问伦敦时，英国政府以战后对待外国元首最隆重的礼遇来欢迎他。在谈判中，英国表示愿在非洲对法国实行政治休战，并且不再反对法国成为核子国家等等，来换取法国的让步。但是，后来的事实表明，这一切的效果很小。由于目前戴高乐企图依靠西德和“共同市场”来增强大国地位，法国也就成了“六国”、“七国”之间“和解”的最顽强的反对者。
    在拉拢法国失败之后，英国转而更多地从拉拢西德着手，以便在“六国”“七国”间“搭桥”，打进西欧大陆阵线，从内部来瓦解“共同市场”和“巴黎—波恩轴心”，实现其欧洲“大自由贸易区”的美梦。因此，一个相当时期以来，英国对西德的态度比过去有了好转。
    从西德来说，它同英国的矛盾是极其深刻的。它同法国组成联盟的目的之一就是对抗英国，但是今年来由于法国企图充当西欧的领导，这使“巴黎—波恩轴心”之间的矛盾有了发展。不久前阿登纳同戴高乐的会谈中，戴高乐提出了所谓“欧洲政治统一方案”。这个方案要使法国在北大西洋集团中成为同美英分庭抗礼的“西欧第三种力量”的代言人。这种以法国为首的“欧洲政治统一”，固然为美国所不满，也不合西德的口味。因此，阿登纳需要对英国作点姿态，以便抑制戴高乐当西欧盟主的野心。同时目前阿登纳在德国和西柏林问题上，在西德核武装问题上都需要英国的支持。在经济上作些让步，来换取英国在政治上的让步，这对西德来说是值得的。因此最近以来西德报纸也在鼓吹“六国”、“七国”“和解”的必要性。为了暂时的相互利用，英国、西德这两个争夺欧洲霸权的主角也忽然变得“亲热”起来。
    但是，这都不足以消除两个集团之间的矛盾。连英国官方人士和舆论界也承认，看不见有什么“魔术式”的和解方案。目前的趋势是，各自整顿内部，加强力量，为下一步的斗争作准备，但又不把文章作死，留下一点转寰余地。但仍不放弃有机会损害一下对方。例如最近美国胁迫西德拿出钱解救美元危机遭到拒绝时，英国也竭力打击西德、离间美国和西德关系。如果说美英矛盾是整个帝国主义阵营的主要矛盾，那么，从长远来看，英国和西德的矛盾就是西欧的主要矛盾。
    控制与反控制的斗争
    在西欧帝国主义国家错综复杂的矛盾闹得不可开交的时候，美国同西欧“盟国”的控制与反控制的斗争，也在激烈地展开。
    美国当前的政策，是把缓和危机和加强对盟国的控制结合起来。美国正企图加强对西方的“集中领导”和“直接领导”。在军事上，以“一体化”计划把“盟国”军事力量“统一”于美国的“发号施令之下”。在经济上力图转嫁危机，保全自己。在这方面，美国一面利用破坏四国首脑会议的局势，以“对付苏联威胁”把“盟国”拴在美国战车上，另一面又以退为进，以拿出一部分核武器与“盟国”分享“控制权”的空名，来诱使英、法放弃自搞“核独立力量”，而服从于美国的意志。但是这一切遭到了英国和法国的反抗。
    在经济和对外“援助”方面，最近由美国发起成立的北大西洋国家“经济合作与开发组织”也反映了美国和西欧国家经济斗争和“援助”（也就是控制）不发达国家问题上的矛盾。美国企图通过这个组织，一方面对西欧的经济政策进行控制，另一方面，压迫西欧国家更多出钱分担由美国控制的对外“援助”。这又引起了一场在经济领域的控制与反控制的斗争。例如，西德垄断资本正在加紧对外扩张，以“援助”为名对亚、非、拉丁美洲国家进行资本输出。但是，它宁愿单独行动，而不愿意把对外“援助”纳入美国的轨道，交给美国控制。英国对美国的作法也存有戒心。伦敦《泰晤士报》在评论这个新成立的“经济合作与开发组织”时就以含蓄的口吻暗示现在美国和西欧的相互关系已经和战后初期不同。当时美国是“援助者”，西欧是“受援者”；现在美国自己财政经济上很困难，需要别人援助。因此在这个组织中最好多一点儿“相互协商”。
    随着美国“领导地位”的削弱，现在“盟国”又在蠢蠢欲动。英国在美国新旧政府交替的外交上出现空隙的机会，又图东山再起夺取西方外交的主动权。有消息说，英国首相麦克米伦在明年准备展开一系列外交活动，其中包括同美国新任总统肯尼迪的会谈、同阿登纳的会谈以及举行英联邦会议。英国有人说这是麦克米伦要拿出点颜色来给肯尼迪看看。这不可避免又将在帝国主义阵营中引起一场争吵。
    1960年就要结束了。当我们相互祝贺“跃进年”和“团结年”的时候，西方过的却是“跃退年”和“矛盾年”。今年的明争暗斗还没有结束，更剧烈的矛盾和更错综复杂的纵横捭阖，又将在明年展开。（附图片）
