    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow. The Leningrad Optical Instrument Factory in the Soviet Union recently produced the largest reflector for telescopes in Europe. This mirror has a diameter of two meters and six centimeters, weighs four tons, and took sixteen months to manufacture.
    This reflector was designed by a group of Soviet engineers led by Lenin Prize winner Yoannisianni. Its aiming and observation of celestial bodies, as well as other operations, are automated. The reflector has a fixed temperature, thus eliminating the possibility of image distortion. A unit twenty times larger than that used to manufacture ordinary reflectors was specially installed to manufacture this reflector. Throughout the entire manufacturing period of the reflector, the workshop temperature must always be maintained at around 25 degrees Celsius.
    This reflector will soon be transported to the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. It will be used to observe the Milky Way and distant extragalactic objects.

    苏联制成欧洲最大天体望远镜反射镜
    新华社莫斯科电　苏联列宁格勒光学仪器工厂最近制成了一面欧洲最大的供天体望远镜用的反射镜。这面镜子直径长达两米六，重达四吨，共制作了十六个月。
    这面反射镜是由列宁奖金获得者约安尼西阿尼领导的一批苏联工程师设计的。它对天体的瞄准和观测以及其它一些操作都是自动化的。反射镜具有固定的温度，因而可以消除影像畸变的可能性。为了制造这面反射镜特地安装了一台比制造一般反射镜大二十倍的机组。在制造反射镜的整个期间，车间温度必须始终保持在摄氏二十五度左右。
    这面反射镜不久将运往苏联科学院克里米亚天体物理学天文台。它将用来观测银河系和遥远的河外天体。
