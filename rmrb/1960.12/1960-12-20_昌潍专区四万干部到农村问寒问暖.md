Xinhua News Agency, Jinan: In order to further promote the in-depth and solid development of production and disaster relief work, the Changwei Special District of Shandong Province sent more than 40,000 cadres to rural households to inquire about their warmth and hardship. From December 6th to 9th, they inspected more than 6,000 production brigades and helped to comprehensively arrange the members' lives for this winter and next spring, thereby greatly encouraging the enthusiasm of the broad masses of members for production and disaster relief.

The Changwei Special District suffered relatively serious natural disasters this year, but the vast number of cadres and the masses throughout the district are full of confidence and have launched a tenacious struggle against the disasters. In order to arrange the production and lives of all members, Party organizations at all levels organized a large number of cadres to go deep into each household to inquire about their warmth and hardship. In Zhucheng County, in addition to cadres at all levels participating in the inspection and visits, 127 experienced farmers were also recruited to form a joint inspection and visit team. They adopted a method of dividing areas of responsibility to conduct on-the-spot inspections and solve problems. During the inspection, leaders at all levels first focused on key units, dissected "sparrows", summarized experience, and then comprehensively promoted it. Through visiting, inspecting, and discovering problems, they immediately solved them and implemented them to the end. The inspection team of the Pingdu County Party Committee found that four members of the Guqian Commune had houses that were not repaired and could not keep out the cold, so they immediately discussed it with the production team and vacated seven offices for proper resettlement.

Through this household-by-household and team-by-team inspection and visit, and helping to solve problems for each person and each matter, the production and disaster relief work in the entire district was further promoted. Now, more than 600,000 people in the district have been投入 [poured into] re-harvesting and re-threshing work, and have re-harvested and re-threshed a total of 46,090,000 catties of various grains; collected a total of 8,090,000 catties of various wild oilseeds, medicinal materials, and wild fibers; and gathered 1.1 billion catties of burning grass. 510,000 laborers have been投入 [poured into] short-distance transportation, fishing, hunting, weaving, embroidery and other sideline production, earning more than 13 million yuan in cash; preparations for next year's production have also been universally launched.

    昌潍专区四万干部到农村问寒问暖
    据新华社济南讯　为了进一步推动生产救灾工作深入踏实地开展，山东昌潍专区四万多名干部深入农户问寒问暖。从12月6日到9日，他们共检查了六千多个生产大队，帮助全面安排社员今冬明春的生活，从而大大鼓舞了广大社员生产救灾的积极性。
    昌潍专区今年遭受了比较严重的自然灾害，但全区广大干部和群众充满信心，同灾害展开了顽强的斗争。各级党组织为了安排好全社社员的生产和生活，组织了大批干部深入各家各户问寒问暖。诸城县除各级干部参加检查访问外，还吸收一百二十七名老农参加，组成联合检查访问队伍，采取分片包干的办法，就地检查和解决问题。在检查中，各级领导首先抓重点单位，解剖“麻雀”，总结经验，然后全面推广，通过边访问、检查、发现问题立即解决问题，一次落实到底。中共平度县委检查组在古岘公社发现有四户社员房子失修不能御寒，立即同生产队研究，腾出了七间办公室，作了妥善的安置。
    通过这样逐户逐队检查访问，逐人逐事帮助解决问题，进一步推动了全区生产救灾工作。现在全区已有六十多万人投入复收复打工作，已复收复打各种粮食四千六百零九万斤；采集各种野生油料、药材、野生纤维等共八百零九万斤；拾烧草十一亿斤。投入短途运输、捕捞、打猎、编制、刺绣等副业生产的劳力五十一万人，收入现金一千三百多万元；明年生产的准备工作也普遍展开。
