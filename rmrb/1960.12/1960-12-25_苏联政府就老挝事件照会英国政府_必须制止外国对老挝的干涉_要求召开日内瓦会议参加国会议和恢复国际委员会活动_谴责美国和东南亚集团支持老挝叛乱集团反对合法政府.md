Xinhua News Agency, December 24th: TASS Moscow, December 23rd – Soviet First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Kuznetsov, received the British Ambassador to Moscow, Roberts, on December 22nd and handed him the Soviet government's note on the Laotian situation. The full text of the note is as follows:

    The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs extends its compliments to the British Embassy in Moscow and only informs the Embassy as follows:

    The Soviet government, as one of the chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina, has received a letter from the Prime Minister of India, in which he draws attention to the recent events in Laos, pointing out that these events have led to the outbreak of a civil war there that may spread and threaten the peace of the entire Indochina. Mr. Nehru expressed his concern about this and requested close attention to the serious situation in Laos. He is convinced that this situation "if it continues and worsens, will nullify everything achieved as a result of the Geneva Accords and may even have serious consequences for other countries in Indochina." He rightly believes that it is urgent to take measures to stop military action in Laos and expresses the hope that the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina can indicate what measures can be taken to achieve this goal. He advocates convening the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos as the first step in this regard, believing that this commission can have a stabilizing influence on the situation in Laos and alleviate the existing tensions there. The Soviet government fully shares the Indian government's concern about the dangerous situation that has developed in the Laotian region and seriously threatens peace in Southeast Asia. In its statement on the Laotian situation on September 22, 1960, and in its note to the US government on this issue on December 13 of this year, the Soviet government pointed out both the causes of the established situation in Laos and the serious consequences that the further aggravation of the Laotian situation may cause.

    The reason for this is the blatant interference in the internal affairs of Laos by the United States and certain other participating countries of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization military bloc. On the one hand, they are providing General Nosavan's rebels with extensive military, material, technical, and financial assistance to oppose the legitimate government of Laos headed by Prime Minister Phouma, and on the other hand, they are blockading Laos. The British government undoubtedly knows that the national government of Laos and its Prime Minister Prince Phouma have repeatedly requested the US government to stop military aid to the rebels, but the US government completely ignores this reasonable request.

    According to recognized international norms, only the legitimate government of Laos has the right to request and receive assistance of any kind from other countries. In view of this, the actions of the US government in providing active military, material, technical, and financial assistance to the rebels (to the extent that US and allied military personnel are actually participating in the rebels' military operations against the legitimate government of Laos) can only be regarded as a blatant violation of international law and the Geneva Accords on Laos, which stipulate that the participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference shall not interfere in the internal affairs of Laos.

    The Soviet government believes that the British government is aware of the fact that the Laotian national government led by Prince Phouma has declared that it continues its activities, that it is the legitimate government of Laos, and that it regards the establishment of a "government" headed by Boun Oum as an unconstitutional act.

    Prime Minister Prince Phouma has stated that any decisions of parliamentarians and the King who have been abducted by the rebels have no legal effect. It is thus clear that Prince Phouma's government remains the legitimate national government of Laos, and it is united around all the true patriotic forces in the country to fight against rebellion and aggression. Therefore, peace-loving countries have an obligation to support the aforementioned legitimate government of Laos.

    The Soviet government believes that in order to mediate the Laotian issue and normalize the situation in this region, it is necessary to convene a meeting of the countries that participated in the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina to discuss the current situation in Laos, and it is necessary to restore the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos.

    However, given that convening the aforementioned meeting requires considerable time, and the current situation requires urgent measures, the Soviet government believes that it is necessary for the two chairmen to call on all participating countries of the Geneva Conference on Indochina to condemn foreign interference in the internal affairs of Laos (which is manifested in multifaceted support for the rebels against the legitimate government of Laos), and to do everything possible to restore normal conditions in Laos to allow this government to carry out its activities.

    The Soviet government also believes that the two chairmen should send a letter to the US government, requesting it to work with the two chairmen to normalize the situation in Laos and, to this end, assist in stopping foreign aid to the rebels of Phoumi Nosavan, recall American military personnel in Nosavan's army, withdraw American military equipment, and exert corresponding influence on other countries that provide military personnel and equipment to the rebellious General Nosavan along with the United States.

    Indian Prime Minister Nehru has suggested resuming the work of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in this country as the first step in stabilizing the situation in Laos. In view of this, the Soviet government would like to draw attention to the fact that the Soviet government has consistently and resolutely advocated the resumption of the Commission's work in order to strictly observe the Geneva Accords on Laos.

    As everyone knows, the Soviet government has consistently advocated the restoration of the activities of the International Commission for Laos in its memorandum to the British government on the Laotian situation on December 14, 1958, in the notes of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs on February 26, March 31, May 30, and April 18, 1960, and in the statement of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs on August 18, 1959, and other documents. However, it is regrettable that these suggestions of the Soviet government have not received the necessary attention from the British chairman, nor have they received the necessary support.

    The events that have occurred in the nearly two years that the Commission has not been able to work in Laos show that, as Mr. Nehru has justifiably pointed out in his letter, the situation in this country has been deteriorating. These events clearly show why the activities of the International Commission for Laos were interrupted and who needed to interrupt them.

    The non-operation of the Commission in Laos is needed by certain groups in the United States, which prevents foreigners from doing whatever they want in this country, prevents them from supporting a government that is beneficial to them in Laos, and also prevents them from uprooting the government that hopes that Laos can be led on the road of peace, neutrality, and national unity.

    The Soviet government believes that the two chairmen should advise the Commission to contact the government of Prince Phouma in order to reach an agreement with it on practical measures related to the resumption of the Commission's activities.

    Considering the severity of the situation in Laos, the Soviet government would be grateful if the British government could express its opinion on the above issues as soon as possible.

    苏联政府就老挝事件照会英国政府
    必须制止外国对老挝的干涉
    要求召开日内瓦会议参加国会议和恢复国际委员会活动
    谴责美国和东南亚集团支持老挝叛乱集团反对合法政府
    新华社24日讯　塔斯社莫斯科23日电：苏联外交部第一副部长库兹?佐夫22日接见了英国驻莫斯科大使罗伯茨，把苏联政府关于老挝事件的照会交给了他。照会全文如下：
    苏联外交部向英国驻莫斯科大使馆致意，并仅向大使馆作如下通知：
    作为关于印度支那的日内瓦会议主席之一的苏联政府收到了印度总理的一封信，他在信中提请注意老挝最近的事件，信中指出，这些事件导致了在那里爆发可能蔓延和威胁整个印度支那和平的内战。尼赫鲁先生对此表示不安，请求对老挝的严重局势给予密切的注意。他确信，这种局势“如果继续下去并且更加恶化，就将使由于日内瓦协定而取得的一切化为乌有，并且甚至可能会对印度支那的其他国家产生严重的后果”。他正确地认为迫切需要采取停止老挝的军事行动的措施，并且表示希望关于印度支那的日内瓦会议的两位主席能指出，可以采取哪些措施来达到这个目的。他主张召集老挝国际监察和监督委员会作为这方面的第一步，他认为这个委员会能对老挝的局势产生稳定的影响，并且能缓和那里现存的紧张局势。苏联政府对印度政府对于老挝地区所形成的和严重威胁东南亚和平的危险局势的关心完全抱有同感。苏联政府在1960年9月22日关于老挝事件的声明和今年12月13日就这个问题给美国政府的照会中，既指出了老挝既成局势的原因，也指出了老挝局势进一步尖锐化可能造成的严重后果。
    这个原因就是美国和东南亚条约组织军事集团的某些其他参加国粗暴地干涉老挝内政，它们一方面给予诺萨万将军的叛乱分子以广泛的军事、物质技术和财政援助来反对以富马首相为首的老挝合法政府，另一方面对老挝进行封锁。英国政府无疑知道，老挝的国家政府及其首相富马亲王不止一次地要求美国政府停止对叛乱分子的军事援助，但是美国政府完全不顾这种合理要求。
    按照公认的国际常规，只有合法的老挝政府有权向别国要求某种援助和获得这种援助。有鉴于此，美国政府给予叛乱分子以积极的军事、物质技术和财政援助的行动（其程度达到美国及其盟国军人实际参加叛乱分子反对老挝合法政府的军事行动），只能被认为是悍然破坏国际法和关于老挝的日内瓦协定，这个协定规定1954年日内瓦会议参加国不得干涉老挝内政。
    苏联政府认为，英国政府对下列事实是知道的，即由富马亲王领导的老挝国家政府曾声明，它继续自己的活动，它是老挝的合法政府，并把成立以文翁为首的“政府”看成是违反宪法的行为。
    首相富马亲王已经说明，已为叛乱分子所掳的议会议员和国王的任何决定都没有法律效力。由此可见，富马亲王的政府仍然是老挝的合法国家政府，在它周围团结着国内一切真正的爱国力量以便同叛乱和侵略作斗争。因此，爱好和平的国家有义务支持上述老挝合法政府。
    苏联政府认为，为了调解老挝问题和使这一地区的局势正常化，有必要召开曾参加1954年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的国家的会议来讨论老挝现在形成的局势，并且有必要使老挝国际监察和监督委员会恢复自己的活动。
    但是，鉴于召开上述会议需要相当时间，而目前情况却要求采取紧急措施，苏联政府认为，有必要由两位主席呼吁关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的所有参加国谴责外国对老挝内政的干涉（这种干涉表现在多方面支持反对老挝合法政府的叛乱分子），并且全力促使在老挝恢复使这个政府进行活动的正常条件。
    苏联政府还认为，两位主席应当致函美国政府，要求它同两位主席共同致力于使老挝局势正常化，并且为此目的协助制止外国援助富米·诺萨万将军的叛乱分子，召回诺萨万军队中的美国军事人员、撤回美国的军事装备，并且对其他那些与美国一道向叛乱的诺萨万将军提供军事人员和装备的国家给予相应的影响。
    印度总理尼赫鲁先生曾建议恢复国际监察和监督委员会在这个国家的工作，以作为稳定老挝局势的第一步，有鉴于此，苏联政府愿意提请注意：苏联政府过去和现在一贯坚决主张上述委员会恢复工作，以利于严格遵守关于老挝的日内瓦协议。
    大家都知道，苏联政府在就老挝局势于1958年12月14日给英国政府的备忘录中、在苏联外交部于1959年2月26日、3月31日、5月30日、1960年4月18日的照会中，以及1959年8月18日苏联外交部的声明和其它文件中，一贯主张恢复老挝国际委员会的活动。但是，很遗憾，苏联政府的这些建议没有受到英国主席必要的注意，也没有得到必要的支持。
    在委员会没有可能在老挝工作的近两年时期内所发生的事件表明，正像尼赫鲁先生在信中有根据地指出的，这个国家的局势是日益恶化了。这些事件明显地表明，老挝国际委员会的活动是为什么中断的、是谁需要中断的。
    不让委员会在老挝活动是美国某些集团所需要的，这个委员会妨碍外国人在这个国家为所欲为，妨碍他们在老挝扶植有利于他们的政府，也妨碍他们拔除希望把老挝引上和平、中立和民族统一道路的政府。
    苏联政府认为，两位主席应当建议委员会和富马亲王政府进行接触，以便就有关恢复委员会的活动的实际措施同它达成协议。
    考虑到老挝局势的尖锐，如果英国政府能尽快地表示自己对上述问题的意见，苏联政府将不胜感谢。
