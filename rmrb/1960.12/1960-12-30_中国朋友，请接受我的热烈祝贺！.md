    Chinese Friends, Please Accept My Warmest Congratulations!
    Representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic, T. Ajidrova
    In February 1960, I was very fortunate to come to the People's Republic of China as a member of the Soviet-Chinese friendship association delegation to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Soviet-Chinese Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. We spent twelve days in China. But in this extremely short period of time, I truly fell in love with this great country and its hard-working and talented people.
    Wherever we went, whether to factories and schools, or people's communes, we felt the great love of our Chinese friends for the Soviet people. We all had the feeling that we were with our own brothers and sisters.
    I will never forget the warm meetings and heartfelt conversations with outstanding Chinese women like the People's Hero Xu Xuehui, Minister of Health Li Dequan, the head of the All-China Women's Federation Cao Mengjun, and others.
    Everywhere we could see the great labor enthusiasm of the Chinese people. We were all heartily glad for the great achievements made by the great Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, which were changing with each passing day. We were all happy that China had become an advanced, highly developed socialist power.
    We also understand that our Chinese friends are also happy for the achievements of the Soviet people. I can happily tell you that under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, our Tajik Republic, like all other fraternal republics, has also made its due contribution to the great cause of communism, and in the struggle for world peace and happiness.
    1960 brought us new great achievements. The industry of our republic completed the 1960 production plan ahead of schedule. Many new industrial enterprises have started construction. The two production lines of the new Stalinabad Cement Plant, a joint factory producing more than one million square meters of carpets, a reinforced concrete structure factory, and a silica brick factory have all been put into production. The construction of the huge Nurek Hydropower Station on the Vakhsh River has also begun. The agriculture of our republic, especially its main sector—cotton planting, is also on the rise. Although the climate conditions this year were not so satisfactory, the cotton farmers of Tajikistan still reaped a bumper harvest. The Tajik Republic completed the plan for paying cotton to the state ahead of schedule in mid-December.
    Dear Chinese friends, 1961 is coming, and 1961 will be a year for the people of our two countries to achieve new labor achievements. We sincerely wish our Chinese friends a happy new year, and hope that our Chinese friends will achieve greater success in building socialism.
    May the red star of the new China in the East radiate even more brilliant light in the new year of 1961!

    中国朋友，请接受我的热烈祝贺！
    塔吉克苏维埃社会主义共和国最高苏维埃代表　塔·阿吉卓娃
    1960年2月，为了庆祝苏中友好同盟互助条约签订十周年，我曾以苏中友好协会代表团的成员身份，非常幸运地来到中华人民共和国。我们在中国度过了十二天。但是在这极其短促的时间里，我确确实实地爱上了这个伟大的国家和这个国家的热爱劳动和天才的人民。
    我们无论走到哪里，无论是工厂和学校，无论是人民公社，我们到处感到中国朋友对苏联人民的巨大的热爱。我们都有这样一种感情，就好像我们是在自己的兄弟姊妹那里一样。
    我任何时候都不能忘记同中国的优秀妇女像人民英雄徐学惠、卫生部长李德全、全国妇联负责人曹孟君以及其他人的热情的会见和倾心的谈话。
    我们到处都可以看到中国人民的巨大的劳动热情。我们都为伟大的中国人民在共产党和以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会领导下所获得的日新月异的成就而衷心地感到高兴。我们都为中国变成了一个先进的、高度发展的社会主义强国而高兴。
    我们也很了解：我们的中国朋友也为苏联人民的成就而高兴。我可以高兴地告诉你们，在苏联共产党的领导下，我们塔吉克共和国，也像其他所有兄弟共和国一样，在争取共产主义的伟大事业中，在争取世界和平和幸福的斗争中，也作出了应有的贡献。
    1960年给我们带来了新的巨大成就。我们共和国的工业提前完成了1960年的生产计划。许多新的工业企业都已开工。斯大林纳巴德新水泥厂的两条作业线、生产能力为一百多万平方米地毯的联合工厂、钢筋水泥结构厂、硅砖厂都已投入了生产。在瓦赫什河上的巨大的努列克水电站的建筑工程也开始了。我们共和国的农业，特别是它的主要部门——植棉业，也处在高涨之中。尽管今年的气候条件不那么令人满意，可是塔吉克的棉农仍然获得了丰收。塔吉克共和国在12月中旬就提前完成了向国家缴纳棉花的计划。
    亲爱的中国朋友，1961年就要来临，1961年将是我们两国人民获得新的劳动成就的一年。我们衷心祝贺中国朋友新年好，并希望中国朋友在建设社会主义事业中获得更大的成就。
    愿东方的新中国这颗红星在新的1961年里放射出更加灿烂的光辉！
