Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 18th - Seoul dispatch: Hundreds of young students in Seoul held a demonstration on the 17th and attacked the South Korean "Senate Auditorium," resolutely demanding the dissolution of the puppet "Senate."

This demonstration was triggered by the "Senate's" amendment of the "Special Law" on punishing election fraudsters in order to protect Syngman Rhee elements. The demonstrators were students injured in the popular uprising against the US-Rhee group's colonial rule in April of this year and some family members of the deceased.

According to South Korea's Tonghwa News Agency, on the 17th, the demonstrating young students held up placards, carried two coffins with the words "Senate Members" written on them, and shouted slogans such as "Dissolve the den of counter-revolutionary forces, the Senate!" During the march, they also continuously shouted slogans demanding the arrest and punishment of the fake police officers who interrogated the demonstrating students during the "March 15th" and "April 19th" people's struggles.

According to reports, when the demonstration reached the "Senate Auditorium," more than a thousand fully armed puppet police officers deployed there by the Chang Myon group carried out rampant suppression, injuring several students and attempting to seize the two coffins carried by the demonstrators. The demonstrating students became even more enraged and engaged in a struggle with the puppet police. At this time, many citizens poured in from all directions to support the struggle of the demonstrating students, and the traffic in front of the "Senate Auditorium" was completely cut off. Shouts condemning the Chang Myon group and demanding the punishment of Syngman Rhee elements shook the entire street.

Under the persistent struggle of the demonstrating students and citizens, the puppet "Senate Speaker" Baek Nak-chun panicked and had no choice but to appear before the demonstrating masses and promise to accept some of the students' demands.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 18th - According to a broadcast by Pyongyang Radio tonight: More than fifty students, teachers, and their families from the South Jeolla Province area of South Korea broke free from the dark rule of US imperialism and its puppets on the 16th and left Mokpo by boat to the longed-for northern part of Korea. However, they were intercepted by the Japanese Maritime Safety Agency en route.

According to the broadcast, the South Korean ship encountered a strong wind at sea, and when the ship was in danger, the Japanese ship "Tokai Maru" not only did not come to the rescue after discovering it but instead notified the Japanese Maritime Safety Agency by telegram. The Japanese Maritime Safety Agency dispatched a ship and unreasonably intercepted the aforementioned fifty-plus South Koreans.

The radio station said that the Japanese authorities not only did not release the above-mentioned personnel but also wanted to send them back to South Korea, which is under the rule of US imperialism and its puppets. It is said that the US naval authorities stationed in Japan also want to interfere in this incident.

Pyongyang Radio firmly demanded that the Japanese authorities immediately send them to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in accordance with the wishes of these South Koreans, and resolutely condemned the conspiracy of the Japanese authorities and US imperialism to send them back to South Korea.

    新华社平壤18日电　汉城消息：汉城数百名青年学生17日举行示威，并袭击南朝鲜“参议院议事堂”，坚决要求解散傀儡“参议院”。
    这次示威是由于“参议院”为了庇护李承晚分子而修改关于惩办选举舞弊者的“特别法”而引起的。示威者是在今年4月间反对美李集团殖民统治的人民起义中负伤的学生和一些死难者家属。
    据南朝鲜同和通讯社报道，17日这天，示威的青年学生举着标语牌，抬着两口上面写着“参议院议员”的棺材，并且高呼“解散反革命势力的老窝参议院！”等口号。在示威队伍前进的途中，他们还不断高呼口号，要求全部逮捕和惩罚在“三·一五”“四·一九”人民斗争时期拷问过示威学生的伪警官。
    据报道，示威队伍冲到“参议院议事堂”时，张勉集团布置在那里的一千多名全副武装的伪警察肆行镇压，打伤了几名学生，并且企图夺取示威队伍抬着的那两口棺材。示威的学生更加愤怒，同伪警察展开了搏斗。这时候，从四面八方涌来的许多市民也支持示威学生的斗争，“参议院议事堂”前面的交通完全断绝，谴责张勉集团、要求惩办李承晚分子的呼喊声震撼了整个街道。
    在示威学生和市民坚持斗争下，傀儡“参议院议长”白乐浚惊慌失措，不得不在示威群众的面前表示答应学生们的部分要求。
    新华社平壤18日电　据平壤广播电台今天晚上广播：南朝鲜全罗南道一带的五十多名学生、教员和他们的家属在16日挣脱了美帝国主义及其傀儡的黑暗统治，乘船离开木浦前往向往已久的朝鲜北部。但是他们在途中遭到了日本海上保安队的拦劫。
    据广播，这批南朝鲜人乘坐的船只在海上航行时遇到了大风，当这只船正处在危险时，日本的“东海丸”号船发现后不仅不前去营救，反而用电报通知日本海上保安队，日本海上保安队派船无理拦劫了上述五十多名南朝鲜人。
    这家电台说，日本当局不仅不释放上述人员，而且要把他们重新送回处于美帝国主义及其傀儡统治下的南朝鲜。据说，驻日本的美国海军当局也要干涉这一事件。
    平壤电台坚决要求日本当局按照这些南朝鲜人的希望立即把他们送到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，并坚决谴责日本当局和美帝国主义企图把他们送回南朝鲜的阴谋。
