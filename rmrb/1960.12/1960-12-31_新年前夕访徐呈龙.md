New Year's Eve Visit to Xu Chenglong
By our correspondent Song Yuanzhi

	On New Year's Eve, I visited Xu Chenglong, the young worker-inventor, deputy director and engineer of the Qingdao Wood Comprehensive Processing Factory. He is currently leading workers in building new workshops.

	This young inventor, from a humble carpenter background who only had two years of schooling in the old society, created and improved 65 kinds of machines, tools, and operational methods during the First Five-Year Plan period, saving more than 318,000 work hours and saving the country 1.5 million yuan in wealth. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, up until he was promoted to engineer in 1959, in less than two years, he created and improved 62 kinds of machines and tools, such as the veneer splicing machine, No. 1 veneer peeling machine, automatic drying machine, and asbestos spinning machine. The asbestos spinning machine alone increased work efficiency by 130 times, saving the country more than 1.6 million yuan. This year, he completed the 100 innovations and leap forward plan more than three months ahead of schedule, and wrote two books, "Wood Board Splicing Machine" and "Four-Sided Drilling Machine," totaling more than 100,000 words, making important contributions to many production technologies. For example, the multi-head drilling machine he and the workers created and modified drills various holes at once and sends them to the next process, without having to drill one side at a time, one type at a time, as before. They also connected thirteen processes of the machine group into a continuous production line, making most of the factory's processes automated and continuous.

	Since the beginning of this year, Xu Chenglong has also helped brother factories solve many key production problems. The workers at the Qingdao Shuanghesheng Kiln Factory who load and unload kilns often operate in high temperatures of 90 to 120 degrees Celsius. The factory's Party committee asked Xu Chenglong to help overcome this difficulty. After accepting the task, he learned about and studied the situation with the leading cadres, technical innovation experts, and veteran workers of the factory. At the same time, he went into the high-temperature kiln to observe carefully. As a result, it only took three days to make a ventilation and cooling device, which reduced the temperature to about 30 degrees, greatly improving the workers' working conditions. The drying cylinder temperature of the Qingdao Paper Mill's paper machine was low, which affected the paper's drying time and prevented the output from increasing. Xu Chenglong took the initiative to help with the research. He was unfamiliar with the machines in this factory. He repeatedly learned about and familiarized himself with the situation, carefully observed the principles of various machines, and finally, with the help of the factory's technical innovation expert Qi Qizhuang and other veteran workers, built a hot air reflection furnace, which increased the temperature from the original 140 degrees to 180 degrees, increased the paper output by 10 meters per minute, and also reduced the moisture content and improved the quality. In this way, he has successively helped more than 20 factories solve many major key problems in production, enabling these factories to continuously leap forward in production.

	He told me: "The Party cultivated and educated me, and I visited many factories and participated in many advanced experience exchange meetings, which are all sources of increasing knowledge." Indeed, he is now not only a carpentry expert, but also an expert who has mastered many scientific knowledge and skills.

	He said: "The Party has given me great honor and responsibility. When you see that every cause of the motherland is developing greatly and needs great development, how can you not think about how to spend less money, not spend money, do more things, and do good things? When you see that many workers and peasant brothers are still using clumsy tools and have to put in hard physical labor, how can you not be anxious to liberate them? Being able to think of one more good thing and do one more good thing is the greatest happiness!"

	These words reminded me of many small things in his life. When he was in Beijing for a meeting, he saw that the service comrades in the guest house had difficulty carrying water up and down several floors, so he used his rest time to run dozens of miles to borrow tools and wood to design a hand-cranked automatic transportation machine for them. In this visit, I went to the temporary dormitory in each field, and the workers enthusiastically introduced to me the benefits of the "earth coal stove" created by Director Xu: it does not require an iron stove and chimney, and it can burn inferior coal. And Xu Chenglong therefore also thought of applying this principle to various boilers, which will not only fully utilize various inferior coals, but also greatly increase the temperature of the boiler. He has listed this innovation as the last important innovation project this year or the first important innovation project next year. At the same time, the important projects that he has successfully trial-produced and is trial-producing also include large lathes, earth gantry planers, high-altitude cableways, winches, track cranes, raw materials collectors, on-site electric train transportation lines, and so on, all of which are the key production problems that urgently need to be solved by the newly built production units. In addition, he will continue to complete the works he is writing, such as "Asbestos Spinning Machine". It can be predicted that in the new year, Xu Chenglong will make greater contributions to the cause of the Party and the people.

    新年前夕访徐呈龙
    本报记者　宋远志
    新年前夕，我访问了青年工人发明家、青岛木材综合加工厂副厂长兼工程师徐呈龙。他正在领导着工人建设新的场坊。
    这个在旧社会只读过两年书、由一个普通木工出身的青年发明家，在第一个五年计划期间，创造、改进了六十五种机器、工具和操作方法，节约了三十一万八千多工时，为国家节省了一百五十万元财富；一九五八年大跃进以来，到一九五九年被提拔为工程师为止，不到两年时间，他创造改进了单板对缝机、一号旋皮机、自动烘干机、石绵纺纱机等六十二种机器和工具，其中单石绵纺纱机一项就提高工作效率一百三十倍，为国家节约一百六十多万元。今年，他又提前三个多月完成了百项革新跃进规划，写出了“木板对缝机”、“四面打眼机”共十万多字的两本书，在许多生产技术上作出了重要贡献。如他和工人一道创造、改制的多头打眼机，一次就把多种多样的眼打好送到下一道工序，用不着像原来那样一面一面的打，一种一种的打。他们还将机器组十三道工序联成一条生产连续线，使全厂大部工序实现了自动化、连续化生产。
    今年以来，徐呈龙还帮助兄弟工厂解决了许多生产关键问题。青岛双合盛窑厂装卸窑的职工，经常在九十至一百二十度的高温中操作，这个厂的党委要求徐呈龙去帮助克服这个难关。他接受任务后，一方面同这个厂的领导干部、技术革新能手和老工人了解研究情况，一方面钻到高温的窑里仔细观察，结果，只用了三天时间，就制成一个通风降温器，使温度下降到三十度左右，大大改善了工人的劳动条件。青岛造纸厂抄纸机的烘缸温度低，影响到纸的干燥时间长，产量不能提高。徐呈龙就主动去帮助研究。这个厂里的机器，他都是陌生的，他一次再次地了解熟悉情况，仔细地观察各种机器的原理，终于在这个厂的技术革新能手戚其庄和其他老工人的帮助下，建成了一座热风反射炉，使温度由原来的一百四十度提高到一百八十度，使纸的产量每分钟增加了十米，还降低了含水率，提高了质量。就这样，他先后帮助二十多个工厂解决了许多生产上的重大关键问题，使这些工厂的生产不断跃进。
    他告诉我说：“党培养教育我，参观了许多工厂，参加了许多先进经验交流会议，这都是增加知识的源泉。”的确，他现在已经不仅仅是木工专家，而且是掌握许多科学方面知识技能的专家了。
    他说：“党给了我很大的荣誉和责任，当你看到祖国每一项事业都在大发展，都需要大发展，心里怎能不想：如何少花钱、不花钱，多办事、办好事？当你看到许多工人农民兄弟还在用笨拙的工具，不得不付出艰苦的体力劳动时，你怎么会不着急去解放他们呢？能多想一件好事情，多作一件好事情，就是最大的幸福！”
    这话使我联想到他的许多生活小事情。他在北京开会的时候，看到招待所的服务员同志提水上下好几层楼很吃力，就利用休息时间，跑出好几十里地，借来工具、木料，为他们设计出手摇自动运输机。在这次访问中，我走到每一个场地的临时宿舍里，工人们都热情地向我介绍徐厂长给他们创造的“土煤炉”的好处：既不用铁炉子和烟筒，又能烧次煤。而徐呈龙却因此又联想到把这种原理用在各种锅炉上，不仅将能充分利用各种次煤，而且能使锅炉的温度大大增加。他已将这项革新列为今年最后一项或者明年最先一项的重要革新项目中。和这同时，他已试制成功和正在试制的重要项目，还有大旋车、土龙门刨高空架索、卷扬机、轨道吊车、原归拢，场内有轨电车运输线，等等，都是围绕着新建生产单位所迫切需要解决的生产关键问题。此外，他还要继续完成正在写作的“石绵纺纱机”等著作。可以预料，在新的一年，徐呈龙对党和人民的事业会做出更大的贡献。
