Title: Significant Achievements in Vietnam's Farmland Water Conservancy Construction; Irrigation Area This Winter and Next Spring Will Increase by Nearly 130,000 Hectares Compared with the Same Period Last Year; Various Regions are Developing Both Large-scale Water Conservancy Projects and Small- and Medium-sized Water Conservancy Construction

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 29th - North Vietnam has achieved remarkable results in farmland water conservancy construction this year. According to Vietnamese newspapers, North Vietnam has built 100.2 million cubic meters of earthwork for water conservancy projects in the first ten months of this year, completing 84.9% of this year's water conservancy construction plan, an increase of 21% over the total amount of water conservancy earthwork completed in the entire year of 1959.

Due to the development of water conservancy work, the irrigation area this winter and next spring will expand by more than 129,000 hectares compared with the same period last year.

Hai Duong Province, which is leading in this year's water conservancy construction movement, has already completed its annual water conservancy construction plan 45 days ahead of schedule.

Some of these water conservancy projects have already begun or will soon begin to serve agricultural production. A large-scale irrigation project being built in the western part of Nghe An Province is expected to be completed in June or July next year, and it will transform more than 5,000 hectares of double-cropping rice fields into triple-cropping rice fields. A large-scale irrigation system started by the people of Ha Dong Province this month will be able to irrigate 13,600 hectares of land and transform these lands from single-cropping rice fields to double-cropping rice fields.

Since this autumn, various regions have been developing small- and medium-sized farmland water conservancy construction while developing large-scale water conservancy projects.

This year, North Vietnam has built a total of 155 medium-sized water conservancy projects and will strive to complete most of them by the end of the year. Each project can irrigate 3,000 to 4,000 hectares of farmland after completion.

Farmers in Vinh Phuc Province have adopted various methods in carrying out small-scale water conservancy construction: such as building dams to store water in highlands and hilly areas, finding water sources and digging wells at the foot of mountains, and building dikes and embankments in plains, semi-mountainous areas, and beach areas to conserve water sources. These small-scale projects require less labor and produce results quickly. Thanh Hoa Province has accepted past experiences and vigorously engaged in water storage and irrigation. The province has excavated a total of 163,000 cubic meters of earth in digging canals and building dams, which can maintain an average water level of 35 to 60 centimeters for farmland, with a maximum of 70 centimeters. The people of all ethnic groups in the Thai-Meo Autonomous Region have newly built and renovated more than 12,000 large, medium, and small water conservancy projects, basically solving the irrigation problems for the early rice crop in the entire region next spring.

The water conservancy technical force in North Vietnam is also growing rapidly. By the end of October, more than 7,700 primary water conservancy technicians trained by the Ministry of Water Conservancy and Electricity and the provincial water conservancy bureaus had greatly strengthened the technical force for surveying, mapping, and construction guidance. The hydrologic scientific research network in the north is also rapidly forming. At present, there are 294 flow observation, water level observation, and hydrochemical research stations established by the central government. In addition, there are 700 small water level and rainfall observation stations run by provinces and the people in 25 provinces. These large and small hydrological scientific research organizations are spread across the large and small rivers in the north, basically forming a hydrological research network.

### 越南农田水利建设成绩显著  今冬明春灌溉面积将比去年同期增加近十三万公顷  各地在发展大型水利工程同时发展中小型水利建设

    越南农田水利建设成绩显著
    今冬明春灌溉面积将比去年同期增加近十三万公顷
    各地在发展大型水利工程同时发展中小型水利建设
    新华社河内29日电　越南北方今年农田水利建设获得显著成绩。据越南报纸报道，越南北方今年前十个月已经建筑了水利工程一亿零二百万土方，完成了今年水利建设计划的84.9％，比1959年全年所完成的水利土方总和还增加了21％。
    由于水利工作的发展，今冬明春的灌溉面积比去年同期将扩大十二万九千多公顷。
    在今年兴修水利运动中领先的海阳省目前已经提前四十五天完成了全年的水利建设计划。
    这些水利工程有的已开始或即将开始为农业生产服务。义安省在西部建设的一个大型灌溉工程，预计在明年6、7月完工，它将把五千多公顷双季稻田改变为三季稻田。河东省人民在本月开始建设的一个大型灌溉系统，将可以灌溉一万三千六百公顷土地，并且把这些土地由单季稻田改变为双季稻田。
    自今年秋季以来，各地在发展大型水利工程的同时，还发展中小型农田水利建设。
    今年越南北方共兴建了一百五十五处中型水利工程，并将争取到年底使它们大部分建成。每处工程建成后可灌溉农田三千到四千公顷。
    永福省农民在进行小型水利建设时采取了各种方法：如在高原丘陵地带筑坝蓄水，在山脚下寻水源打井，在平原、半山区和滩地区则围堤培埂，以保蓄水源。这些小型工程费工少，见效快。清化省接受过去的经验，大搞蓄水灌溉，全省在挖渠筑坝中共挖土十六万三千方，可使农田平均保水三十五到六十公分，最高达七十公分。傣苗自治区各族人民已新建和重修大、中、小水利工程一万二千多处，基本上解决了全区明春早造的灌溉问题。
    越南北方的水利技术力量也正在迅速成长。到10月底，由水利电力部和各省水利厅训练培养的初级水利技术干部有七千七百多名，大大增强了测量、制图和施工指导的技术力量。北方的水文科学研究网也正在迅速形成。目前，由中央建立的流量观测、水位观测和水文化学研究站有二百九十四处。另外在二十五个省内还有七百处省办和民办的小型水位和雨量观测站。这些大小水文科学研究组织遍布北方大小河流，基本上形成了一幅水文研究网。
