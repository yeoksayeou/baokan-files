    Wishing Dear Chinese Friends New Achievements in the New Year
    Liu Kosmodemyanskaya, Member of the Soviet Peace Defense Committee, Director of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association Council
    Dear Chinese friends, I warmly congratulate you on the New Year of 1961 and sincerely hope that you will achieve new labor victories and achievements in all aspects of economic, cultural, and social life.
    How much I want to shake the hands of my Chinese brothers—the selfless workers, the farmers who have obtained abundant harvests, the brave and inquisitive young people who have mastered knowledge and new technologies, and the friends I met in China. Of course, I also really want to hug and kiss those Chinese children with dark eyes, the new generation of China that is growing up.
    Thanks to the great labor enthusiasm of 650 million people, your country has successfully overcome all the difficulties it faces and is rapidly becoming a country with modern industry and agriculture. This amazing change is possible because the people have gained power, and the Chinese people, under the wise leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, have consistently moved along the socialist road. Therefore, the Chinese people have also contributed to the cause of consolidating the strength of the socialist camp.
    The forces of peace and socialism have surpassed the declining forces of capitalism, which is making a last-ditch struggle to maintain its rule. But the shameful chains of imperialism's colonial system have been broken. History has pronounced its death sentence. The East Wind has prevailed over the West Wind. We believe that this powerful wind will eventually dispel the dark clouds of the threat of a new world war that are gathering over humanity.
    The Soviet people and the fraternal Chinese people have forged an unbreakable bond. Under the leadership of the Leninist Central Committee of the Communist Party, the Soviet people are confidently building a communist society and are achieving tremendous and ever-changing achievements in economic construction, culture, and science every year.
    The friendship between our two peoples is cemented with the sacred blood of the martyrs of communism, the blood of our children. Our children, like Zoya and Shura, dedicated their young lives to the struggle for the freedom and independence of their motherland.
    Dear Chinese friends, although Moscow is thousands of kilometers away from Beijing, our hearts are always with you. There is no force in the world that can destroy our friendship and unity. When the New Year arrives, after a day of intense labor, New Year's fireworks will be lit in every family, every street, and every square in our cities. When the bells of the Kremlin ring, the first toast of the Soviet people will be to peace, to mutual understanding and friendship among the people of the world, and to the powerful socialist camp, the mainstay against all the conspiracies of imperialist aggressors.
    Dear friends, Happy New Year, and I sincerely hope that you will achieve new successes in the cause of building socialism!

    祝亲爱的中国朋友们新的一年获得新成就
    苏联保卫和平委员会委员苏中友好协会理事会理事  柳·科斯莫杰米扬斯卡娅
    亲爱的中国朋友，我热烈地祝贺你们1961年新年好，并衷心地希望你们在经济、文化和社会生活各个方面都获得新的劳动胜利和成就。
    我是多么想握一握我的中国兄弟们的手——忘我劳动的工人、获得丰收的农民、掌握了知识和新技术的勇敢而富于求知心的青年，以及我在中国时所见到的那些朋友们的手呵。当然，我也非常想抱一抱和吻一吻那些眼珠长得挺黑的中国孩子，他们是正在成长中的中国的新的一代。
    由于六亿五千万人民的巨大的劳动热情，你们的国家成功地克服了面临的一切困难，正迅速地成为一个拥有现代化工业和农业的国家。这种令人惊奇的变化所以成为可能，就是因为人民获得了政权，中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党中央委员会的英明领导下，始终如一地沿着社会主义道路前进。因而，中国人民对于巩固社会主义阵营威力的事业，也作出了贡献。
    和平和社会主义的力量已超过正在衰退的资本主义的力量，资本主义正在作最后的挣扎，以图维持它们的统治。但是帝国主义的殖民制度的可耻的锁链已被冲破。历史已宣判了它的死刑。东风已压倒西风。我们相信，这强有力的风终将驱散密集在人类上空的新世界战争威胁的乌云。
    苏联人民和兄弟的中国人民结成了永不破裂的联系，苏联人民在列宁式的共产党中央委员会的领导下，满怀信心地在建设共产主义社会，而且每年在经济建设、文化和科学等方面，都获得日新月异的巨大成就。
    我们两国人民的友谊是用共产主义的烈士的神圣的血、我们儿女们的鲜血凝结在一起的。像卓娅和舒拉一样的我们的儿女，把他们年青的生命贡献给争取祖国自由与独立的斗争。
    亲爱的中国朋友，莫斯科离北京虽有数千公里之远，但是我们的心永远和你们在一起。世界上还没有一种力量能够破坏我们的友谊和团结。当新年降临的时候，在紧张的一天劳动过去以后，我们城市的每个家庭，每条大街和每座广场上都燃起新年的焰火。在克里姆林宫的钟声鸣响的时候，苏联人民的第一杯酒将是为和平，为世界各国人民之间的相互了解和友谊，为抗拒着帝国主义侵略者一切阴谋的中流砥柱——强大的社会主义阵营而干杯。
    亲爱的朋友们，祝你们新年好，我衷心地希望你们在建设社会主义的事业中获得新的成就！
