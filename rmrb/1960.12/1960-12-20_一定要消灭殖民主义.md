The Fifteenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly discussed the declaration proposed by the Soviet Union on granting independence to colonial countries and peoples from November 28 to December 14. It finally adopted a declaration proposed by 43 Asian and African countries with an overwhelming majority. The declaration pointed out that the people of the world are urgently hoping to eliminate colonialism in all its manifestations. The declaration recommends that immediate steps be taken in trust territories and non-self-governing territories, and all other territories that have not yet achieved independence, to transfer all powers unconditionally and without reservation to the people, so that they can enjoy full independence and freedom. The declaration also stipulates that all armed actions and repressive measures against colonial peoples must be stopped, and points out that any attempt to disrupt national unity and territorial integrity is intolerable. The adoption of the proposal by the 43 Asian and African countries is a heavy political and moral blow to imperialism headed by the United States and all new and old colonialists; it is a major victory for all anti-colonial forces in the world; and it is a great encouragement to the people of all countries still under colonial rule.

The adoption of the "Declaration on the Independence of Colonial Countries and Peoples" by Asian and African countries at the United Nations General Assembly is the result of the joint efforts of many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, as well as socialist countries, at this session of the General Assembly. As everyone knows, at the beginning of this session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet delegation submitted a draft declaration on granting independence to colonial countries and peoples. This draft demanded the immediate elimination of colonialism. The Soviet proposal reflected the just demands of the oppressed nations in Asia, Africa, and the whole world, and was praised and supported by representatives of most Asian and African countries at the United Nations General Assembly. Although the substantive part of the declaration draft proposed by the Soviet Union was not adopted due to the obstruction and manipulation of imperialism headed by the United States, missing the required votes by only three, the declaration draft later adopted by the Asian and African countries actually contained the basic principles of the Soviet draft.

At present, the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are developing vigorously. Especially in Africa, the last colonial continent of imperialism, the colonial peoples are using increasingly powerful forces to impact the last positions of the imperialist colonial system. This new situation, in which the balance of power between the world's national liberation movement and colonialist forces has undergone profound changes, cannot but be reflected to a certain extent even in the United Nations. The discussion on this issue at this session of the United Nations General Assembly is enough to show how isolated imperialism headed by the United States is.

At this session of the United Nations General Assembly, a sharp political struggle unfolded between anti-colonial forces and imperialist colonial forces. The Soviet Union and other socialist countries, together with some Asian, African, and Latin American countries, exposed and condemned the new and old colonialists headed by the United States on the platform of the United Nations General Assembly. They sharply pointed out that not only are those old colonialists maintaining their brutal and barbaric colonial rule over colonial peoples, but also the American imperialists, as neo-colonialists, are pursuing colonial expansion policies in a more insidious and more vicious manner, becoming the most dangerous enemy of all oppressed nations today. Soviet representative Zorin solemnly pointed out that American-style colonialism not only takes the form of openly ruling and occupying other countries' territories, but also takes the form of disguised, and therefore more dangerous, jurisdiction and control over those ostensibly independent regions and countries. American imperialism is the biggest international exploiter and the main pillar of modern colonialism.

The representative of American imperialism, Wadsworth, attempted to whitewash the United States on the issue of colonialism, saying that the United States "supports" the role of the United Nations in "helping establish new countries" and providing "assistance" to these countries, and also vigorously peddled the neo-colonialist plan of American imperialist boss Eisenhower to "assist" Africa through the United Nations. However, the attempt by the representative of American imperialism to use sweet words such as "assistance" to confuse world public opinion is futile. From the various criminal activities of the United States in plotting to subvert the legitimate government of the Congo under the guise of the United Nations, strangling the independence of the Congo, and then replacing Belgium's colonial power in the Congo, people have increasingly deeply recognized the sinister face of American neo-colonialism. The so-called "assistance" from the United Nations is an important conspiracy plan of American neo-colonialism. At present, American imperialism is stepping up the implementation of new colonial plans in Africa. Ghana's Chargé d'Affaires in the Congo, Welbeck, recently correctly pointed out to the people at a mass rally after returning home, "If we do not pay attention, the United States—this greedy country—will endanger the independence of Africa."

The imperialist colonial forces headed by the United States have tried every possible means to obstruct and sabotage the discussion of the issue of eliminating colonialism at this session of the United Nations General Assembly. However, the more they obstruct and sabotage, the more they isolate themselves in the face of powerful anti-colonial forces, and the more they expose their vicious colonialist faces. In the process of discussing the issue of colonialism, in addition to a small number of colonial countries and their lackeys, the vast majority of representatives condemned colonialism and demanded the complete and immediate elimination of colonialism. The imperialist colonial forces headed by the United States reluctantly pieced together a so-called "majority" and "vetoed" the Soviet declaration draft; but they finally could not prevent the passage of the basic principles contained in the Soviet declaration and reflected in the declaration draft proposed by the forty-three Asian and African countries. It should be emphasized that the draft declaration on the independence of colonial countries and peoples by Asian and African countries was adopted by an overwhelming majority of ninety votes to zero. Only a small handful of guardians of barbaric colonial systems and racial discrimination systems, such the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, and the Union of South Africa, abstained from the vote. Facts show that the movement to eliminate colonialism is a powerful historical trend in the contemporary world, which cannot be resisted or stopped by any imperialism and reactionaries.

After a sharp struggle, the anti-colonial forces of the Soviet Union and socialist countries, and the countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, broke through the obstruction and manipulation of American imperialism, enabling this session of the United Nations General Assembly to adopt a document of Asian and African countries on opposing colonialism. This is of course conducive to the struggle of the people of all countries to win and safeguard national independence. In order to turn the anti-colonial content of this document into reality, it will mainly depend on the resolute struggle of all oppressed nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and colonialism in the future. History and the discussion process of this United Nations General Assembly have shown that imperialism headed by the United States will never automatically abandon its colonial policies. In order to win the victory of the cause of national liberation, the people of all countries must carry out a long and arduous struggle against imperialism. The development of the Congo event has once again proved this truth. As the Soviet representative said at the United Nations General Assembly, "The Congo event has dispelled the naive illusions of certain strata of people in colonial countries, and not only in colonial countries, about the promises made by colonialists on various occasions, including on the platform of the United Nations." This conclusion is completely correct. The statement issued by the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries recently held in Moscow pointed out: "The independence of hundreds of millions of people in Asia, Africa, and other parts of the world was won by them in a fierce struggle against imperialism." The statement also pointed out: "The people of colonial countries strive for their independence through armed struggle or non-violent means according to the specific conditions of their countries. They must strive for consolidated victory on the basis of a strong national liberation movement. Colonialist countries will not grant freedom to the colonial people, nor will they voluntarily abandon the countries they exploit."

The liberated Chinese people have always regarded supporting the struggle of the people of all countries against imperialism and colonialism, and striving for and safeguarding national independence as their sacred international obligation. The Chinese people support the great efforts made by the Soviet Union at this session of the United Nations General Assembly to oppose colonialism. We sincerely sympathize with and support the urgent desire of the people of all countries expressed in the declaration proposed by the forty-three Asian and African countries to strive for independence and freedom and to demand the elimination of all manifestations of colonialism. The Chinese people firmly believe that in the international situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, relying on the national liberation struggles being waged by the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries, relying on the great unity of the people of socialist countries, the revolutionary masses of capitalist countries, and all oppressed nations, we will surely be able to finally eliminate all colonialism. The complete collapse of colonialism is inevitable.

### 一定要消灭殖民主义

    一定要消灭殖民主义
    十五届联合国大会从11月28日起到12月14日期间，讨论了苏联提出的关于给予殖民地国家和人民独立的宣言，最后以压倒多数通过了亚非四十三国所提出的一项宣言。这项宣言指出，世界人民迫切希望消灭一切表现的殖民主义。宣言建议在托管领地和非自治领地以及还没有取得独立的一切其他领地内立即采取步骤，无条件和无保留地将所有权力移交给人民，使他们能享受完全的独立和自由。宣言还规定必须制止各种对付殖民地人民的一切武装行动和镇压措施，并且指出，破坏民族统一和领土完整的任何企图都是不能容忍的。亚非四十三国的提案的通过，对于以美国为首的帝国主义和一切新老殖民主义者来说，都是一次政治上、道义上的沉重打击；对于全世界一切反殖民主义力量来说，是一次重大的胜利；对于一切还处在殖民统治下的各国人民来说，是一个巨大的鼓舞。
    亚非国家“关于殖民地国家和人民的独立的宣言”在联合国大会上的通过，是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲许多国家以及社会主义各国在本届联大共同努力的结果。大家知道，早在本届联合国大会之初，苏联代表团曾经提出一项关于给予殖民地国家和人民独立的宣言草案。这个草案要求立即消灭殖民主义。苏联的这项提案，反映了亚洲、非洲和全世界一切被压迫民族的正义要求，在联合国大会上得到了大多数亚非国家代表的赞扬和支持。苏联提出的宣言草案的实质部分，虽然由于以美国为首的帝国主义的阻挠和操纵，仅以三票之差没有得到通过，但是，后来通过的亚非国家的宣言草案实际上包含了苏联草案中的基本原则。
    当前亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲民族解放运动正在蓬勃发展，特别是在帝国主义的最后一块殖民大陆——非洲，殖民地的人民正以日益增强的巨大的力量冲击着帝国主义殖民体系的最后阵地。今天世界民族解放运动同殖民主义势力的力量对比发生深刻变化的这种新形势，即使是在联合国中也不能不得到一定程度的反映。这一届联合国大会关于这一问题的讨论，足以说明以美国为首的帝国主义处于何等孤立的地位。
    在这一届联合国大会上，反殖民主义力量和帝国主义殖民势力之间，展开了一场尖锐的政治斗争。苏联和其他社会主义国家，同一些亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲国家一道，在联合国大会的讲坛揭露和谴责了以美国为首的新老殖民主义者。他们尖锐地指出，不仅那些老牌殖民主义者正在维护着它们对殖民地人民的残暴的和野蛮的殖民统治，而且美帝国主义者正在以新殖民主义者的姿态，更加阴险和更加毒辣地推行着殖民扩张政策，而成为一切被压迫民族当前最危险的敌人。苏联代表佐林严正地指出，美国式的殖民主义不仅采取公开统治和侵占别国领土的形式，而且也采取伪装的、因而也是更危险的管辖和控制那些表面上独立的地区和国家的形式。美帝国主义是最大的国际剥削者，是现代殖民主义的主要支柱。
    美帝国主义的代表华兹沃斯企图在殖民主义问题上为美国涂脂抹粉，说美国“支持”联合国在“帮助建立新国家”和对这些国家提供“援助”方面的作用，并且还大肆兜售美帝国主义头子艾森豪威尔通过联合国“援助”非洲的新殖民主义计划。但是，美帝国主义的代表想要用“援助”之类的花言巧语来迷惑世界舆论，是徒劳的。从美国在联合国旗号的掩护下策划阴谋颠复刚果合法政府，扼杀刚果独立，以便进而替代比利时在刚果的殖民势力的种种罪恶活动中，人们越来越深刻地认清了美国新殖民主义的凶恶面目。所谓联合国的“援助”，就是美国新殖民主义的一项重要的阴谋计划。目前，美帝国主义正在非洲加紧推行着新的殖民计划。加纳驻刚果的代办韦尔贝克最近在回国后的一次群众集会上曾向人民正确地指出，“如果我们不加注意的话，美国——这个贪婪的国家——将危害非洲的独立。”
    以美国为首的帝国主义殖民势力，曾经千方百计地企图阻挠和破坏本届联合国大会对消灭殖民主义问题的讨论。但是，它们越是阻挠和破坏，越是使它们自己在强大的反殖民主义力量面前更加孤立，更加暴露了它们的殖民者的凶恶面目。在讨论殖民主义问题的过程中，除了一小部分殖民主义国家及其仆从外，绝大多数代表都谴责了殖民主义，并且要求彻底和立即地消灭殖民主义。以美国为首的帝国主义殖民势力勉强地拼凑了一个所谓“多数”，“否决”了苏联的宣言草案；但是它们终于不能阻挠苏联宣言中所包含的、并且在亚非四十三个国家所提的宣言草案中得到反映的基本原则的通过。应该着重说明，亚非国家关于殖民地国家和人民独立宣言草案是以九十票对零票的压倒多数通过的。只有美国、英国、法国、比利时、西班牙、葡萄牙以及南非联邦等这一小撮野蛮的殖民制度和种族歧视制度的卫道者，在表决时弃权。事实表明，消灭殖民主义的运动，是当代世界的一股强大的历史潮流，这是任何帝国主义和反动派所不能够抗拒，不能够阻挡的。
    苏联和社会主义各国，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国的反殖民主义力量在经过一场尖锐斗争之后，突破了美帝国主义的阻挠和操纵，使本届联合国大会通过了亚非国家关于反对殖民主义的一项文件，这当然是有利于各国人民争取和维护民族独立运动的。为了把这个文件的反殖民主义内容变成现实，主要的将取决于今后亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲一切被压迫民族反对帝国主义和殖民主义的坚决斗争。历史和这次联合国大会的讨论进程都表明，以美国为首的帝国主义是绝不会自动地放弃殖民政策的。各国人民为要争取民族解放事业的胜利，必须同帝国主义进行长期的艰巨的斗争。刚果事件的发展又一次证明了这个真理。正如苏联代表在联合国大会上所说，“刚果事件打消了殖民地国家，而且不仅是殖民地国家的某些阶层的人民对殖民主义者在各种场合，其中包括在联合国讲坛上许下的诺言的天真的幻想。”这个结论是完全正确的。最近在莫斯科举行的各国共产党和工人党代表会议所发表的声明指出：“亚洲、非洲和世界其他地区亿万人的独立，是他们在同帝国主义进行残酷的搏斗中争取到的。”声明又指出：“殖民地各国人民根据本国的具体条件，通过武装斗争或者非战争的方式争取自己的独立。他们要在强大的民族解放运动的基础上，争取巩固的胜利。殖民主义国家不会把自由恩赐给殖民地人民，也不会自愿放弃被它们剥削的国家。”
    解放了的中国人民从来都把支持各国人民的反对帝国主义和殖民主义，争取和维护民族独立的斗争当作自己的神圣的国际义务。中国人民支持苏联在本届联合国大会上为反对殖民主义所作的巨大的努力。我们衷心地同情和支持在亚非四十三个国家提出的宣言中所表达的各国人民争取独立和自由、要求消灭殖民主义的一切表现的迫切愿望。中国人民坚决相信，在东风压倒西风的国际形势下，依靠亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民正在进行的民族解放斗争，依靠社会主义各国人民、资本主义国家革命的人民大众和一切被压迫民族的大联合，一定能够最后消灭所有殖民主义。殖民主义的完全崩溃是不可避免的。
