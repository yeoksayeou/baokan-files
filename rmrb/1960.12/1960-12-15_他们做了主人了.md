    "They Have Become Masters"
    Chen Si

    Reading this collection of essays, poems, and paintings depicting the million serfs of Tibet standing up to become masters of their own destiny, my heart swells and surges with emotion. I am suddenly reminded of what Chairman Mao enthusiastically extolled in his article "Introducing a Cooperative":

    "Do the Chinese working people still have that slave-like appearance of the past? No, they have become masters. The working people of the People's Republic of China, on 9.6 million square kilometers, have now truly begun to rule this land."

    The life of Tibetan serfdom, despite lingering on for a few more years, has finally been brought to an end. The million serfs have finally broken free from the shackles they bore for thousands of years, standing tall on the fertile land they irrigated with their own blood and sweat, raising their land deeds high, and laughing heartily towards the snowy mountains and the red sun. People share the same feelings, and hearts resonate with the same sentiments. When we recall the scene of land being returned to its owners and the joy of liberation, how can we not be happy for our Tibetan brothers?

    The leap in productive forces inevitably leads to a leap in thought; the smashing of the shackles of slavery will surely usher people's mental outlook into a new realm. That is why people sing so joyfully about the Party and Chairman Mao, and why they are so enthusiastically engaged in production, striving for a great agricultural harvest on the plateau. The area of cultivated land can be calculated, the yield can be calculated, but the potential of people is incalculable. This potential has already begun to manifest itself in the people who have broken free from their bonds and become masters of the land for the first time.

    Imperialism and other reactionaries are not reconciled to their failures in China. The same is true for their failure in Tibet. Not long ago, at the United Nations General Assembly, didn't the imperialist elements still try to use the "Tibet issue," this piece of rotten meat, to spread poison once again? This is not surprising at all. The million serfs of Tibet, having become masters of the land and overthrown the arrogance of the masters who had ridden on their necks for generations, how could this not break the hearts of those who fantasize about restoring sinful rule and undermining China's unity! Let them also read these articles and listen to the laughter on that land. Whether they are heartbroken, stamping their feet, or gnashing their teeth, the Tibetan people will join hands with their brothers and sisters in the great family of the motherland, holding high the three red flags, and advancing triumphantly in songs of victory. Because they have forever shaken off the slave-like appearance, "they have become masters!"

### “他们做了主人了”

    “他们做了主人了”
    陈思
    读了这一组描写西藏百万农奴翻身作主的散文、诗和画，心潮起伏，激荡不已。我突然又想起毛主席在《介绍一个合作社》一文里所热情歌颂的：
    “中国劳动人民还有过去那一副奴隶相么？没有了，他们做了主人了。中华人民共和国九百六十万平方公里上面的劳动人民，现在真正开始统治这块地方了。”
    西藏奴隶制的寿命，尽管苟延残喘，多活了几年，但百万农奴终于最后挣脱了那副带了千百年的枷锁，在自己用血汗灌肥了的沃土上挺起腰来，高高地举起土地证，对着雪山红日纵情欢笑了。人同此心，心同此理，当我们一回想起土地还家、翻身欢乐的情景，又怎能不为西藏弟兄们高兴呢？
    生产力的飞跃必然带来思想的飞跃；奴隶枷锁的粉碎，一定要把人们的精神面貌引入新的境地。这就是为什么人们那样兴高彩烈地歌唱党，歌唱毛主席，又为什么那么劲头十足地搞生产，要争取高原上的农业大丰收。耕地面积可以计算，产量可以计算，人的潜力却是无法计算的，这潜力，已经开始在冲破了羁缚、第一次成为土地的主人的人们身上显露出来。
    帝国主义及其他反动派对他们在中国的失败，是不会甘心的。对他们在中国西藏的失败，亦复如是。不久以前，在联合国大会上，帝国主义分子不是还想利用“西藏问题”这块臭肉，企图再散布一次毒菌吗？这是一点也不奇怪的。西藏百万农奴，做了土地的主人，打垮了世世代代骑在他们脖子上的老爷们的威风，这怎会不教那些妄想复辟罪恶统治、妄想破坏中国统一的人伤心落泪！也让他们来读一读这些文章、听一听在那块土地上的欢笑声吧，无论他们痛心疾首也罢，顿足捶胸也罢，咬牙切齿也罢，西藏人民将跟祖国大家庭的兄弟姐妹们一起，高举三面红旗，唱着凯歌猛进。因为，他们已经永远地摆脱了奴隶相，“他们做了主人了”！
