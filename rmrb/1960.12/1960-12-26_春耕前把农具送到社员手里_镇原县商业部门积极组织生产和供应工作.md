Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou. Commercial departments in Zhenyuan County, Gansu Province, are actively organizing the production and supply of agricultural tools for the coming spring plowing season, striving to deliver the tools to commune members before spring cultivation begins. Currently, the county has produced 440 simplified walking plows for spring sowing, over 5,200 plowshares, and more than 245,000 other small farm tools.

Since the autumn harvest this year, the commercial departments of Zhenyuan County have organized more than 280 employees to go to the countryside to understand the types, specifications, quality, and quantities of agricultural machinery and spare parts needed for maintenance by various commune production teams. They consulted with the county and commune industrial departments to make unified production arrangements. The commercial departments have assigned cadres with agricultural production experience to be stationed in thirteen farm tool factories to participate in planning, production, and accounting, guiding them to improve product quality.
