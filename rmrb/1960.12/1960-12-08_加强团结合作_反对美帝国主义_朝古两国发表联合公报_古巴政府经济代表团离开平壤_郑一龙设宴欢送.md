Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 6th:  North Korean Deputy Premier Zheng Il-ryong and Cuban National Bank President Major Ernesto "Che" Guevara today in Pyongyang signed a joint communiqué between the government economic delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the economic delegation of the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Cuba.

The communiqué states that during the visit, the two government economic delegations held talks, discussed the current international situation, the situations in North Korea and Cuba, and the issue of further developing friendly and economic cooperative relations between the two countries, and reached completely unanimous opinions on all issues discussed.

The communiqué said that U.S. imperialism is expanding its arms, organizing various military blocs against peace-loving countries, cruelly suppressing the just struggles of the people for national liberation and independence, brazenly interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, carrying out military provocations around the world, and intensifying international tensions. They are occupying South Korea, frantically preparing a new armed attack against the northern half of the Republic, and carrying out political, economic, and military aggression against the Cuban revolution.

Both sides emphasized in the communiqué that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of the world and the irreconcilable enemy of the people of North Korea and Cuba.

The communiqué points out that in the talks, both sides expressed great satisfaction with the fact that the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries are increasingly strengthening and developing.  The communiqué said that the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries is a historic event that opens a new stage in the development of friendly relations between the two countries.

The communiqué points out that the trade and payment agreement and the related agreements and plans on cultural, scientific, and technological cooperation signed by the two governments will promote mutual understanding and cultural ties between the two peoples and will make a great contribution to the development of trade relations and national economies between the two countries.

The communiqué said that the Korean people have always actively supported and voiced their solidarity with the Cuban people in their struggle against the enslavement of U.S. imperialism and for the freedom and independence of their motherland.

The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is convinced that the Cuban people will defeat the vicious aggressive actions of U.S. imperialism, defend their national independence, and achieve the final victory of the Cuban revolution.

The communiqué points out that during the talks, both sides unanimously emphasized that the issue of Korean reunification is a ripe issue that urgently needs to be resolved.

The economic delegation of the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Cuba fully supports the unwavering position of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that the reunification of Korea must be achieved through free North-South general elections on a democratic basis without any external interference.

Both sides resolutely oppose the U.S. imperialist policy of colonial enslavement and national division schemes in Korea, and strongly advocate that the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops must immediately withdraw from South Korea.

Both sides expressed their firm determination to further strengthen and develop the solidarity and cooperation between the peoples of the two countries forged in the just struggle against the common enemy – U.S. imperialism.
