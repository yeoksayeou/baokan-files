Good Leader, Good Manager

The Nantianpo Production Team of Zhangshe Commune in Pingdu County, Shandong Province, used to be a very poor place. Before liberation, forty-four households in the village where this production team was located were begging for food year-round, and more than thirty people were hired by landlords to work as laborers, with every family lacking food and clothing. After liberation, especially in recent years, thanks to the superiority of the people's commune and the concerted efforts of cadres and the masses, the team's grain production has increased year by year, and forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries have also developed greatly. When the villagers talk about these changes, they all praise the production team's cadres for faithfully implementing the Party's policies and setting an example in everything they do, saying that they are good leaders and good managers of the production team.

Practical and Resourceful - Wu Jiemao

Since becoming the Party branch secretary of the Nantianpo Production Team, Wu Jiemao has always earnestly studied and resolutely implemented the Party's policies, maintaining close ties with the masses. Last spring, the team was worried that the timely spring planting would be affected because livestock and fertilizer could not be transferred in time. He went to discuss the matter with experienced farmers. At a discussion meeting, veteran villager Han Fenggao said: "It doesn't matter if there is more land and less livestock. Can't we use spades and hoes? Didn't we poor people rely entirely on our own hands to farm the land in the past when we didn't have livestock?" Old man Li Jingmi suggested: "If there is not enough fertilizer, the manure from each household's pig pens, grinding areas, and ditches in our village has not been dug out. Wouldn't it be good fertilizer if we dug it out and sent it to the fields!" Wu Jiemao and the branch committee members studied these opinions together, immediately formulated a short-term plan, and took the lead in implementing it. When the villagers saw this, they all said: "The ideas were put forward by us and Jiemao together, and he is taking the lead in working. We must keep up." As a result, all eighty-nine able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers in the team launched a five-day crash campaign to accumulate 150,000 jin of fertilizer, and planted 1,200 mu of spring fields half a month ahead of schedule.

In production, Wu Jiemao is always at the forefront. He often asks the team leaders to set an example for the masses in everything they do. He himself spends twenty-five or six days a month participating in labor, contracting work and doing jobs like the villagers. Last year, excluding meetings and research work, he worked a total of more than 310 workdays, which was more than the average laborer. This year, when sowing wheat in the autumn, he led the young people in plowing the land, operating the drills, and sowing seeds. In addition to training eight apprentices, he himself sowed more than 60 mu of land. Despite the heavy tasks and the shortage of labor, the team ranked first in the county in the sowing work.

Because Wu Jiemao participates in production, leads production, and is an experienced farmer, he has plans for everything. Every winter, he arranges the spring work. Although the harvesting and planting tasks were heavy this autumn, thanks to his good planning with the villagers, more than 1,000 mu of wheat and more than 1,000 mu of sweet potatoes and peanuts were harvested and planted very well.

"Household Elder" Han Lisheng

Old warehouse keeper Han Lisheng is called "Household Elder" by the villagers. This title is an evaluation of his ability to manage the household well, and expresses the villagers' respect for him.

Since being elected by the masses as warehouse keeper in 1954, old Communist Party member Han Lisheng has cherished public property, even a blade of grass or a piece of wood, day after day for six years. He keeps the team's commonly used tools in an orderly manner, and criticizes anyone who carelessly damages farm tools or does not put them away properly after use. Last spring plowing, he calculated that it would cost hundreds of yuan just to buy ropes and other utensils. In order to save expenses, he mobilized the villagers to collect some old rope ends and old cloth scraps, and he himself went to cut some strips and rushed to make thirty sets of plough harnesses, forty cage muzzles, and dozens of donkey "neck collars," saving the production team more than 100 yuan. Under his leadership, the villagers throughout the team have generally developed a good habit of cherishing public property. In recent years, the number of tools in the team has only increased and not decreased, and they have rarely been damaged, which has played a great role in ensuring agricultural production. He is even more careful in storing grain and grass. Whenever he has time, he checks the granaries and haystacks one by one, and he checks more frequently during the rainy season, fearing that rainwater will overflow into them. This spring, some villagers were wasting grain in their eating habits, and "Household Elder" severely criticized those who wasted. As of this autumn, the team still had more than 100,000 jin of fodder and dried vegetables saved up. The masses said happily: "With 'Household Elder,' we don't have to worry about not living a good life!"

"Living Abacus" Wu Junying

Another cadre of Nantianpo who is loved by the masses is the young female accountant Wu Junying, who is known as the "Living Abacus" by the villagers.

In 1954, Communist Party member Wu Junying returned to Nantianpo after graduating from high school, determined to work here for the rest of her life to develop agricultural production. At first, she worked as a work recorder in the team. Because she was fair and selfless in her work, she was quickly elected as the director of the agricultural cooperative. After communization, this agricultural cooperative became a production team, and she was elected as the team accountant. At that time, she was not very familiar with bookkeeping and using the abacus, but she did not flinch. While burying herself in studying books, she took time to run to other production teams five or six miles away to consult with old accountants, and soon became an "expert." In the past year or so, the accounts she has kept have been clear and accurate, without any errors.

As an accountant, Wu Junying is not only good at keeping accounts and calculating, but also a caring person for the villagers. She often explains the calculated accounts to illiterate villagers door-to-door, stroke by stroke, and even goes to the fields to announce them to the villagers, trying her best to make the villagers feel clear about everything. When the villagers saw the lights still on in her room at night, they advised her to rest, and she said: "If the accounts are not calculated well, everyone will not feel clear about things, and I can't sleep well either." She makes sure that all accounts are settled in a timely manner and announced monthly.

Wu Junying knows by heart how much fertilizer each villager has accumulated, how many workdays they have done, and how much remuneration they should receive. Whether on the street or in the fields, if any villager wants to ask about their income, she can say it clearly. As time went on, the villagers said gratefully: "Our accountant is really like a 'living abacus,' everyone feels clear and at ease." Military dependent Old Granny Liu also entrusts Wu Junying to handle everything from her son sending letters and remitting money, saying: "With a caring person like you, what can I not be at ease about!"

    好领导  好当家
    山东省平度县张舍公社南坦坡生产队，原来是个十分穷困的地方。解放前，这个生产队所在的村庄有四十四户常年讨饭，三十多人常年给地主扛活，家家缺吃少穿。解放后，特别是最近几年来，由于人民公社的优越性，由于干部群众同心协力，全队粮食产量逐年增长，林、牧、副、渔四业也有很大发展。社员们在讲到这些变化时，都赞扬生产队的干部们忠诚地执行党的政策、处处以身作则，说他们是生产队的好领导、好当家人。
    实干多谋　吴捷茂
    吴捷茂从担任南坦坡生产队的支部书记以来，一直认真研究和坚决贯彻执行党的方针政策，密切联系群众。去年春天，队里因为牲口和肥料一时调动不过来，眼看着要影响适时春播。他就去找老农商量，在座谈会上，老社员韩风诰说：“地多牲口少不要紧，咱不会用锨翻镢刨？早先咱穷人没牲口，不全是靠这一双手种地的吗？”李景密老大爷献计说：“肥料不足，咱村各户的圈底、磨道、阴沟都没挖，挖出来送到地里不都是好肥料！”吴捷茂和支部委员们一起研究了这些意见，立即订出了小段计划，并且自己带头干起来。社员见了都说：“点子是咱大伙和捷茂一起出的，干活他又走在咱头里，咱一定要跟上。”结果全队八十九名整半劳力，突击五天就积肥十五万斤，一千二百亩春田提早半个月播完种。
    在生产上，吴捷茂总是跑在最前头，他常常要求小队长样样都做群众的榜样。他自己月月都要抽出二十五、六天时间参加劳动，和社员一样包工包活。去年，他除去开会和研究工作，一共做了三百一十多个劳动日，比一般劳力做的劳动日还多。今年秋种小麦时，他领着青年人刨地、扶耧、播种，除了带出八名徒弟外，自己还播了六十多亩地。这个队在任务重、劳力少的情况下，播种工作名列全县第一。
    吴捷茂由于参加生产、领导生产、又是种庄稼的老行家，事事有打算，每年冬天就安排好春天的活。今秋尽管收种任务重，但由于他和社员们计划得好，一千多亩小麦，一千多亩甘薯、花生，收、种得都很好。
    “把家老”韩立升
    老保管员韩立升，被社员们叫做“把家老”。这个称呼是对他会过日子的评价，表示了社员们对他的尊敬。
    老共产党员韩立升从1954年被群众选为保管员以来，六年如一日，对公共的东西哪怕一草一木都很爱惜。他把队里常用的工具都保管得有条不紊，谁不小心搞坏了农具或用完以后不整理好，他就要不客气的批评。去年春耕时，他计算了一下，光买绳索等用具就得百十元。为了节约开支，他就发动社员凑了些旧绳头、旧布片，自己又去割了些条子，赶制了三十副犁套、四十个笼嘴和好几十个驴“围脖”，为生产队省下了一百多元。在他的带动下，全队社员普遍养成了爱护公物的良好风气。几年来，队里的工具只增不减，很少损坏，对保证农业生产起了很大作用。保管粮草他更用心，一有空就挨个检查粮仓和草垛，雨季他检查得更勤，唯恐溢进雨水。今春，有些社员在吃粮上有浪费现象，“把家老”就严肃地批评了浪费的人。直到今秋，这个队还存着节省下来的十万多斤饲草和干菜。群众都高兴地说：“有‘把家老’，不怕咱日子过不好！”“活算盘”吴俊英
    南坦坡的另一个受群众喜爱的干部是被社员们称为“活算盘”的青年女会计吴俊英。
    1954年，共产党员吴俊英在高小毕业后，回到了南坦坡，决心为发展农业生产在这里干一辈子。开始时她在队里当记工员，因为办事大公无私，很快就被选为农业社社长。公社化以后，这个农业社成为一个生产队，她又被选为队会计。当时她对记账工作和打算盘都不太熟悉，但她没有退缩，一面埋头学习书本知识，一面瞅空就跑到五、六里外的其他生产队去请教老会计，很快就成了“行家”。最近一年多来，她记的账目一清二白，没有差错。
    吴俊英当会计不光是记账算账好，还是社员的贴心人，她常把算出的账目挨门逐户向不识字的社员一笔一笔地解释，甚至到田间去向社员公布，千方百计地让社员心里亮堂。社员们见她屋里夜里还亮着灯就劝她休息，她说：“账算不好，大家心里不亮堂，我睡也睡不好”。她对所有账目都做到及时结算，按月公布。
    吴俊英对哪户社员积了多少肥，做了多少劳动日，该领多少报酬，都背得烂熟，不管在街上还是在地里，哪个社员要问问自己的收益，她都能说得一清二楚。日子一长，社员们感激地说：“咱的会计真像个‘活算盘’，人人心里又明快、又放心。”军属刘老大娘，连儿子捎个信、汇点钱也都托吴俊英代办，她说：“像你这样的贴心人，有什么事我不放心呢！”
