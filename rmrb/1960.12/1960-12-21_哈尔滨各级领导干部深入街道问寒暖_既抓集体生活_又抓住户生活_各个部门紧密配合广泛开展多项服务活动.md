Harbin (reporter) The CCP Harbin Municipal Committee and Party organizations at all levels conduct in-depth visits to street residents, service stations, kindergartens, and nurseries to comprehensively arrange the people's livelihood throughout the city.

Since the beginning of winter, the number of people eating at home has increased due to heating. Based on this situation, the CCP Harbin Municipal Committee immediately proposed to Party organizations at all levels throughout the city: in arranging the people's economic life, the principle of "walking on two legs" must be implemented, grasping both collective life and household life; grasping both the buildings and courtyards where life is organized, and the remote and scattered households, to further promote production. The Party committees of all people's communes in the city conscientiously implemented the instructions of the Municipal Committee and quickly launched this work.

The characteristics of this work carried out by Party organizations at all levels in Harbin are that the First Secretary takes the lead, going to the residents to discover problems and solve them. On December 7th and 8th, the leading comrades of the Municipal Committee, headed by Ren Zhongyi, the First Secretary of the Municipal Committee, collectively went to visit some residents' families in the Struggle, Daowai, Taiping, and Daoli People's Communes, widely talking with housewives, understanding their supply of winter vegetables, coal, etc., discovering life problems, and solving them in a timely manner. For example, the leaders of the Municipal Committee discovered that Wang Pingxin, a resident of Yimian Street in the Daoli People's Commune, had just moved from another place and had no stored vegetables at home, and immediately instructed the Commune Party Committee to help arrange it. On the same day, the commune sent people to deliver more than 100 jin of cabbage. The children, eating the fresh cabbage, said, "The commune uncles are so good!" Xu Fang, a resident of the Fushun Branch, was moved to tears when she saw the leaders of the Municipal Committee asking about their well-being. She said, "In the old society, men were arrested to be laborers, and no one cared if the family lacked firewood and rice; today, life is so good that the secretary and mayor still come to visit, it's really like heaven and earth!"

Driven by the Municipal Committee Secretariat, the Party organizations of the people's communes, branches, and management areas formed resident life visiting groups or teams, going deep into the residents to earnestly help the masses arrange their lives. After the leaders of the Municipal Committee visited the residents, the Party Committee of the Daowai People's Commune immediately held a Party committee meeting to study how to further arrange the lives of the masses. It was also decided that the secretary would take the lead in urgently solving the problem of the masses waiting a long time to buy coal. Because the Commune Party Committee grasped it tightly and forcefully, in just three days, 60 additional supply points were added, greatly shortening the time for the masses to buy coal, and delivering coal to the homes of 7,670 households with no labor force or dual-income families.

The CCP Harbin Municipal Committee's deep and detailed work in comprehensively organizing the people's economic life has brought about a new situation in various service undertakings. Under the slogan of "Politics Enters the Canteen," the people's communes have successively held various political work conferences for service undertakings. "Politics Enters the Canteen, Service Station, Grain Store, Kindergarten, and Nursery" has become the unanimous slogan of business personnel, service personnel, and childcare personnel. In order to give full play to the role of the service station, the Party Committee of the Daoli People's Commune also conducted a survey of households to provide door-to-door service and take full responsibility, actively carrying out various service activities, buying coal, firewood, and daily necessities for the masses. Under the slogan of "Politics Enters the Grain Store," the 17 grain stores of the Xiangfang People's Commune fully implemented the practice of issuing tickets in the team, greatly facilitating the masses' purchase of grain.

Harbin City also adopted the method of combining vertical and horizontal lines and multi-party cooperation to vigorously grasp life. While the people's communes are vigorously grasping the people's economic life, the municipal-level business departments are also actively cooperating in many ways. For example, in the process of running canteens well, the competent department specially organized a technical service team to conduct roving performances and impart technology. At present, they have finished imparting knowledge in the city and are preparing to go to the counties to continue spreading experience. The Municipal Women's Federation and the Education Bureau cooperated to actively improve the service level of childcare personnel and improve children's food. The Municipal Health Bureau also actively carried out activities such as preventing winter diseases in children and improving children's nutrition. These activities have powerfully promoted the further development of the work of comprehensively arranging the people's economic life.

    哈尔滨各级领导干部深入街道问寒暖
    既抓集体生活  又抓住户生活
    各个部门紧密配合广泛开展多项服务活动
    本报讯　中共哈尔滨市委和各级党组织，深入访问街道居民、服务站、幼儿园、托儿所，全面安排全市人民生活。
    入冬以来，市民结合取暖，在家就食人员增多。中共哈尔滨市委根据这一情况，立即向全市各级党组织提出：在安排人民经济生活中，必须实行“两条腿走路”的方针，既抓集体生活，又抓住户生活；既抓生活上组织起来的大楼、大院，又抓偏僻分散的住户，进一步促进生产。全市各人民公社党委认真贯彻了市委的指示，迅速展开了这项工作。
    哈尔滨市各级党组织开展这项工作的特点是，第一书记挂帅，到居民中去发现问题，解决问题。12月7、8两日，首先以市委第一书记任仲夷同志为首的市委书记处书记、常委等领导同志，集体深入到奋斗、道外、太平、道里等人民公社部分居民家庭中进行访问，广泛地和家庭主妇们进行了交谈，了解她们过冬的蔬菜、煤柈等供应情况，发现生活问题，及时解决。如市委领导同志发现道里人民公社一面街居民汪萍新从外地搬来，家里没有贮存蔬菜，立即责成公社党委帮助安排。当天，公社即派人送去了一百多斤白菜。孩子们吃着鲜嫩的白菜说：“公社叔叔真好！”抚顺分社居民徐芳看到市委领导同志问寒问暖，感动得热泪夺眶而出。她说：“旧社会男人被抓去当劳工，家里少柴无米没人管；今天日子过得这样好，书记、市长还来访问，真是天上地下！”
    在市委书记处的带动下，各人民公社、分社和管理区的党组织，纷纷组成了居民生活访问团或小组，深入到居民中去，切切实实地帮助群众安排生活。道外人民公社党委在市委领导同志访问居民之后，立即召开党委会，研究如何进一步安排好群众生活。并决定由书记挂帅，突击解决群众购买煤炭等候时间较长的问题。由于公社党委抓得紧，抓得狠，仅三天的时间，就增设了六十处供应点，大大缩短了群众的买煤时间，并为七千六百七十户无劳力或双职工的居民送煤到家。
    中共哈尔滨市委对于全面组织人民经济生活工作抓深、抓细的结果，使各项服务事业出现了新的局面。在“政治进食堂”的口号下，各人民公社都先后召开了各种各样服务事业的政治工作会议，“政治进食堂、服务站、粮店、幼儿园、托儿所”，已经成为营业员、服务员、保教人员的一致口号。道里人民公社党委为了充分发挥服务站的作用，广泛开展多项服务活动，还在居民群众中进行了服务到门，一包到底的户数调查，积极开展多项服务活动，为群众代买煤、柈和日用品。香坊人民公社十七个粮店在“政治进粮店”的口号下，全面实行了下组开票，大大方便了群众购粮。
    哈尔滨市还采取条块结合，多方配合的方法大抓生活。在各人民公社大抓人民经济生活的同时，市一级的各业务主管部门也积极地多方配合。例如在办好食堂的过程中，主管部门专门组织了技术服务团，进行巡回表演，传授技术。目前，他们已在市内传授完毕，正准备去各县，继续传播经验。市妇联、教育局共同配合，积极提高保教人员的服务水平，改善幼儿伙食。市卫生局也积极开展幼儿冬季防病和搞好幼儿营养等活动。通过这些活动，有力地促进了全面安排人民经济生活工作的进一步开展。
