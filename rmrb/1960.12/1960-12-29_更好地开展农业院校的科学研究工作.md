To Better Develop Scientific Research in Agricultural Colleges
Zhao Shanhuan

In the situation of the whole Party and the whole people engaging in agriculture and grain production on a large scale, all walks of life are supporting agriculture. Higher agricultural colleges bear special responsibilities. Higher agricultural colleges have relatively strong scientific and technological forces. They are not only bases for training agricultural construction talents, but also an army of agricultural scientific research, and should contribute to agricultural production. In recent years, China's agricultural science has made brilliant achievements. The scientific research work of various higher agricultural colleges has also seen an unprecedented situation. Like South China Agricultural College and other brother institutions, we have also achieved great results in scientific research. A notable example is the successful utilization of distant hybridization to cultivate high-yielding rice varieties with thousands of grains per panicle, opening up new avenues for high rice yields.

The fundamental reason why South China Agricultural College has been able to achieve such great accomplishments in scientific research over the past three years lies in the resolute implementation of the Party's educational policy and scientific research policy, closely integrating scientific research with productive labor and teaching, implementing the mass line in research work, vigorously carrying out mass movements, and adhering to the policy of research serving production and closely combining theory and practice.

Resolutely implementing the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor" is the prerequisite for doing a good job in scientific research in higher agricultural colleges. Under the guidance of this policy, the close integration of scientific research with productive labor and teaching will not only greatly improve the quality of teaching, but also powerfully promote scientific research. In this regard, we have explored some experiences and have a relatively deep understanding. For example, in 1959, seedling death occurred in the direct-seeded early rice fields of our college farm. In order to explore the causes and prevention measures of seedling death, the college promptly convened an on-site meeting on the issue of rice seedling death. Teachers from agronomy, soil agrochemistry, plant pathology, plant physiology, and meteorology, as well as students managing rice production, all participated in the meeting. Through detailed on-site observation, everyone carefully discussed the causes of seedling death, and at the same time immediately launched mass scientific research to find the causes and prevention measures of rice seedling death. One class adopted a variety of experiments and found the causes and prevention measures for seedling death. This class wrote a paper on the results of the experiment, breaking away from the past view that seedling rot must be due to low temperature and water shortage, and proposing the comprehensive factors causing seedling rot. Through this stage of work, the students not only greatly enriched their knowledge of seedling rot in rice cultivation, but also achieved positive results in scientific research. This example fully demonstrates the benefits of the combination of teaching, productive labor, and scientific research.

Of course, in higher agricultural colleges, not all scientific research must be integrated in these three ways. Some research of a basic theoretical nature and research to meet the long-term needs of production can be carried out independently. However, the majority of the main research topics facing agricultural science should be carried out in accordance with the principle of the three-way combination. To do a good job in the three-way combination, we must see the differences and characteristics of the three, and also see the internal connections of the three, and promote the organic combination of the three, so as to achieve a mutually complementary effect.

In higher agricultural colleges, as in specialized research institutions, the struggle between the two lines on scientific research is acute. Establishing the absolute leadership of the Party in agricultural scientific research and adhering to putting politics in command is the fundamental guarantee for the continued leap forward in agricultural science. Our main differences with bourgeois scholars are manifested in the mass line in scientific research and the integration of theory with practice.

We believe that scientific research in higher agricultural colleges, like any work, must fully rely on the masses and follow the mass line. The most basic masses in the school are students. Students from the first to the fifth grades can and must participate in scientific research activities and become the basic team of the school's scientific research work. Scientific research must also be combined inside and outside the school, and must be combined with the majority of farmers with emphasis, and learn from the farmers, because the production practice of China's 500 million farmers is the source of agricultural scientific development. People who hold bourgeois views think the opposite. They believe that agricultural science can only be done coldly and quietly by a few experts and cannot be done in a large-scale mass movement. They believe that everyone's participation will reduce the level of scientific research, and that mass scientific research is a "mess." Facts have proved that this view is completely unfounded. When students understand the significance of scientific research, break superstitions, set high ambitions, and master methods, they can quickly achieve significant results. For example, all the fourth-year students of the Department of Soil Agrochemistry, under the guidance of teachers, went to Dali Commune in Nanhai County to conduct soil surveys and study how to transform low-yield fields into high-yield fields at high speed. After a period of work, they found common ways and specific measures to improve the soil, and wrote papers that were well received by cadres and masses who led agricultural production. Teachers and students of the Entomology Teaching and Research Group jointly studied the relationship between rice fields and surrounding weeds and pests, and discovered the overwintering hosts of several major rice pests. They found that rice planthoppers and leafhoppers laid more eggs on barnyard grass, sand grass, and orchard grass. In response to this situation, they provided new methods for the prevention and control of agricultural pests. These examples all show that students not only can but should participate in scientific research. Their potential in scientific research is unlimited and their strength must be fully utilized. For them, participating in scientific research is also a component of learning. Of course, in the school's scientific research work, the role of teachers must also be fully utilized. Teachers are a guiding force in the school's scientific research. Once their theoretical knowledge is combined with practice and the individual is combined with the masses, they can play a significant role in scientific research. We advocate the combination of teachers and students, learning from each other's strengths and making up for each other's weaknesses, and jointly doing a good job in the school's scientific research work.

We believe that agricultural science must serve agricultural production, and theory and practice must be closely integrated. When formulating research plans, we must arrange research topics according to production needs, focusing on solving the urgent problems in current production, supplemented by solving the problems needed for future production, and at the same time conduct some basic theoretical research related to guiding production development. People who hold bourgeois views are the opposite of us. They despise production practice and often go to old literature to find research topics, or conduct research based on personal interests. They believe that studying the problems existing in production practice is a low-level technical promotion work and has no creativity. They fundamentally do not see the dialectical relationship between production and science, and do not see that the theoretical research level can be greatly improved on the basis of summarizing the mass experience of high yields. We have repeatedly criticized this wrong view in the school, adhered to the principle of science serving production and integrating theory with practice, and concretized this principle in the form of the combination of teaching, productive labor, and scientific research.

In order to carry out agricultural scientific research more effectively, we must fully understand the characteristics of agricultural production and master the general and special laws of agricultural production. The object of agricultural production is living organisms. Whether it is plants or animals, they all have their own laws of growth and development. We must study these laws and find ways to promote the growth and development of crops and livestock. Agricultural production is largely controlled by natural conditions and has prominent regional characteristics. Various natural disasters often bring instability to agricultural production. We must study the natural conditions in various regions and find effective measures to overcome natural disasters, ensure bumper harvests year after year, and make agricultural production continue to leap forward. At present, China's agricultural production is almost entirely manual, so it is necessary to study tool reforms to rapidly increase labor productivity and gradually realize the agricultural technological revolution.

Scientific research should link theory with practice, and also be good at selecting some practical scientific research results in a timely manner and promoting them to the masses. In the process of promotion, we must promptly summarize experience, discover problems, organize further experiments, deepen theoretical research, understand the laws, and further enrich and develop the original theory in practice.

Since the Great Leap Forward, there has been new development in the theoretical research of agricultural science. This is primarily due to the role of the "Eight-Point Charter" for agricultural production increase. In soil science, the active role of human factors in transforming soil has been affirmed, and the viewpoint of promoting and controlling the directional development of soil fertility has been established. In crop cultivation, the theory of sparse planting has been broken, and the theory of rational close planting has been established. The theory of shallow plowing has been broken, and the theory of deep plowing has been established. The concept of population has been proposed in crop physiology and ecology. In fruit tree cultivation, the theory of sparse flowering and fruit thinning has been broken, and the theory of preserving flowers and fruit has been established. In the distant hybridization of animals and plants, Michurin's theory of heredity has been further explored. These new theories have already played a huge role in guiding agricultural production. However, judging from the rapid development of China's agricultural production, our theoretical research is still far from meeting the requirements. In the process of agricultural production, in agricultural biology, there are many laws that we have not yet mastered. Therefore, higher agricultural colleges must unite with scientific research institutions and the vast masses of farmers to study theory and develop theory on the basis of carrying out scientific experiments and summarizing farmers' experience, so as to lay the foundation for further supporting agriculture. China's agricultural production experience is exceptionally rich, but agricultural scientific theory is far behind production practice. This backward situation must be changed.

How can we develop agricultural scientific theory and improve the level of theoretical research? We believe that agricultural scientific workers should first arm themselves with dialectical materialism, deeply explore some basic issues based on summarizing the farmers' experience of high yields, and apply the latest achievements of modern science, such as the law of rice's absorption of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Secondly, in the process of promoting new farming systems, we must promptly discover problems, put forward new viewpoints, and further organize forces to conduct experiments. In the research process, we must launch criticisms against all kinds of metaphysical and idealistic viewpoints existing in the field of agricultural science and biological science.

A better way to support agriculture is to promptly promote the results of scientific research, especially the promotion of improved varieties; run training courses and organize professional teams to go to the countryside to provide technology, and purposefully solve the key problems in production. This year in October, rice planthoppers harmed rice in some areas of Guangdong. We promptly organized two professional teams to Shaoguan and Zhanjiang to study effective prevention and control measures for rice planthoppers, and proposed to use a mixture of 666 and DDT mixed with fine sand and spread on the rice fields to kill insects, which saved DDT and improved labor efficiency, effectively curbing the disaster of rice planthoppers. In veterinary medicine, we often organize professional teams to go to the countryside to study the treatment methods of various animal diseases and treat livestock for communes, which is deeply welcomed by the masses.

Higher agricultural colleges must have their own base for carrying out scientific activities, so that research work and the promotion of achievements can be closely combined, using scientific and technological support for the production of the base, and absorbing rich practical experience from the production of the base, which can be summarized and elevated to theory. In addition to a relatively large farm of its own, the scientific activity base of South China Agricultural College also has base points established in seven communes. For example, at our base point in Dali Commune, Nanhai County, we are cooperating with commune cadres to use radioactive isotopes to study the law of wheat's absorption of phosphorus fertilizer.

In the past three years, the achievements made by our higher agricultural colleges in agricultural scientific research have been huge, but in the new situation of the whole Party and the whole people engaging in agriculture and grain production on a large scale, we must not be satisfied with the existing achievements. The potential of scientific research in higher agricultural colleges is very great. As long as we resolutely implement the policy of combining teaching, productive labor, and scientific research, vigorously carry out mass scientific research movements, and adhere to the policy of integrating theory with practice, we will definitely be able to exert greater strength to support agriculture and ensure the continued leap forward in agricultural production!

    更好地开展农业院校的科学研究工作
    赵善欢
    在全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的形势下，各行各业都在支援农业，高等农业院校更担负了特殊的任务。高等农业院校拥有比较雄厚的科学技术力量，既是培养农业建设人材的基地，又是农业科学研究的一个方面军，更应该为农业生产出力。近几年来，我国农业科学取得了辉煌的成就。各个高等农业院校的科学研究工作，也出现了前所未有的局面。华南农学院和其他兄弟院校一样，在科学研究工作上也取得了很大的成果，显著的如利用远缘杂交、培育水稻千粒穗已成功，为水稻高产开辟了新的途径。
    三年来，华南农学院在科学研究上所以能够取得这样巨大的成就，根本原因在于坚决贯彻了党的教育方针和科学研究方针，将科学研究与生产劳动、教学密切结合起来，在研究工作中贯彻群众路线，大搞群众运动，并坚持研究工作为生产服务、理论和实践密切结合的方针。
    坚决贯彻党的“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与劳动生产相结合”的方针是搞好高等农业院校科学研究工作的前提。在这个方针的指导下，把科学研究与生产劳动和教学紧密结合起来，就不仅大大提高教学质量，而且可以有力地推动科学研究工作。在这方面，我们摸索了一些经验，有比较深刻的体会。例如1959年，我们学院农场早造直播水稻田发生死苗现象，为了探求死苗的原因及防治措施，学院及时召开了水稻死苗问题现场会议。农学、土壤农化、植物病理、植物生理及气象等有关系的教师和管理水稻生产的同学都参加了会议。通过现场的详细观察，大家认真地讨论死苗的原因，同时立即开展群众性的科学研究，寻找水稻死苗的原因和防治措施。其中一个班采取了多种多样的试验，找出了死苗的原因和防治措施。他们这个班将试验的结果写成了论文，打破了过去那种认为烂秧一定是由于低温缺水的说法，提出了产生烂秧的综合因素。经过这一阶段的工作，不仅大大丰富了同学们对水稻栽培上烂秧问题的知识，而且在科学研究上取得了积极的成果。这个例子，充分说明了教学、生产劳动、科学研究三结合的好处。
    当然，在高等农业院校里，并不是所有的科学研究都必须三结合，有一些带基础理论性质的研究和满足生产长远需要的研究有必要独立地进行。但是，摆在农业科学面前大量的主要的研究课题，毕竟是应该在三结合的原则下来进行。而要搞好三结合，就必须既要看到三者的区别和各自的特点，又要看到三者的内在联系，促使三者有机地结合起来，从而收到相辅相成的效果。
    在高等农业院校里，如同在专业研究机构中一样，科学研究工作上两条道路的斗争是尖锐的。在农业科学研究工作中树立党的绝对领导，坚持政治挂帅，是农业科学工作持续跃进的根本保证。我们和资产阶级学者的主要分歧表现在科学研究工作走群众路线和理论联系实际两个方面。
    我们认为高等农业院校的科学研究工作，同任何工作一样，必须充分依靠群众，走群众路线。在学校里最基本的群众是学生。从一年级到五年级的学生都可以而且必须参加科学研究活动，成为学校科学研究工作的基本队伍。科学研究又必须校内外结合，必须有重点的和广大农民结合起来进行，向农民学习，因为我国五亿农民的生产实践是农业科学发展的源泉。持有资产阶级观点的人则相反，他们认为农业科学只能由少数专家冷冷清清地做，不能大搞群众运动。他们认为大家动手就会降低科学研究的水平，群众搞科学研究是“乱哄哄”，事实证明，这种看法是完全没有根据的。当同学们明确了科学研究工作的意义，破除迷信，立大志，掌握了方法，就能很快取得显著的成绩。例如土壤农化系四年级的全体学生在教师指导下到南海县大沥公社进行土壤调查，研究怎样高速度地把低产田变为高产田，经过了一段时间的工作，他们找出了改良土壤的共同途径和具体措施，写成了论文，获得领导农业生产的干部和群众的好评。昆虫教研组的老师和同学共同进行水稻田和周围杂草、害虫发生关系的研究，发现了几种主要水稻害虫的越冬寄主，发现在稗草、沙草及园果雀稗杂草上稻飞虱及浮尘子产卵较多，针对这种情况，他们对农业害虫防治上提供了新的办法。这些例子都说明学生不仅可以，而且应当参加科学研究。他们在科学研究工作上的潜力是无限量的，必须充分发挥他们的力量。对他们来说，参加科学研究也是学习的一个组成部分。当然，在学校的科学研究工作中，也必须充分发挥教师的作用。教师是学校科学研究中的一支指导力量，他们的理论知识一旦与实际相结合，个人一旦与群众相结合，就可以在科学研究上发挥很大的作用。我们提倡师生结合，取长补短，共同搞好学校的科学研究工作。
    我们认为，农业科学必须为农业生产服务，理论与实际必须密切结合。在制定研究计划时必须针对生产需要来安排研究课题，以解决当前生产中迫切问题为主，以解决将来生产需要的问题为辅，同时进行一些有关指导生产发展的基础理论的研究。持有资产阶级观点的人和我们相反，他们轻视生产实践，往往专从旧文献中去找研究课题，或者从个人兴趣出发进行研究。他们认为研究生产实践中存在的问题是属于低级的技术推广工作，没有什么创造性。他们根本看不到生产与科学的辩证关系，看不到在总结群众丰产经验的基础上能够大大提高理论研究水平。我们在学校里反复批判了这种错误的观点，坚持了科学为生产服务，理论联系实际的方针，并且在教学、生产劳动和科学研究三结合的形式下把这条方针具体化。
    为了更有效地开展农业科学研究，我们必须充分认识农业生产的特点，掌握农业生产的一般规律和特殊规律。农业生产的对象是活的有机体，不论植物和动物，都有其生长发育的规律，我们必须研究这些规律，找出能促进农作物和家畜的生长发育的办法。农业生产在很大程度上受自然条件的支配，具有突出的地区性，各种自然灾害经常给农业生产带来不稳定性，我们必须研究各地区的自然条件，找出克服自然灾害的有效措施，确保年年丰收，使农业生产持续跃进。目前我国农业生产几乎完全是手工操作，因此必须研究工具改革以迅速提高劳动生产率，逐步实现农业技术革命。
    科学研究要理论联系实际，还要善于及时选出一些切实可行的科学研究成果，推广到群众中去。在推广的过程中，要及时总结经验，发现问题，组织进一步的试验，深入理论研究，摸清规律，在实践中进一步丰富和发展原有的理论。
    大跃进以来，在农业科学的理论研究方面有了新的发展，这首先是由于农业增产“八字宪法”的提出起了很大的作用。在土壤学中，肯定了人为的因素对改造土壤的能动作用，确立了促进和控制土壤肥力定向发展的观点。在作物栽培学中，破稀植论，立合理密植论，破浅耕论，立深耕论。在作物生理生态上提出了群体概念。在果树栽培学中，破疏花疏果论，立保花保果论。在动、植物远缘杂交方面，进一步探讨了米丘林遗传学说。这些新的理论对指导农业生产已经发生了巨大的作用。但从我国农业生产的迅速发展来看，我们的理论研究距离要求还很远，在农业生产过程中，在农业生物学中，有很多规律，我们还未掌握。因此，高等农业院校必须与科学研究机关、广大农民群众联合起来，在开展科学实验、总结农民经验的基础上，钻研理论，发展理论，为进一步支援农业打下基础。我国农业生产经验异常丰富，但农业科学理论远远落后于生产实践。这个落后局面必须加以改变。
    怎样才能发展农业科学理论，提高理论研究水平呢？我们认为农业科学工作者首先应以辩证唯物主义武装自己，在总结农民丰产经验的基础上，运用现代科学最新成就深入探索一些基本问题，例如水稻对氮、磷、钾的吸收规律问题。其次要在新的耕作制度推行过程中，及时发现问题，提出新的观点，进一步组织力量进行试验。在研究过程中，必须对农业科学和生物科学领域里存在的形形色色的形而上学和唯心观点展开批判。
    支援农业比较好的办法是及时推广科学研究的成果，特别是推广优良品种；开办训练班和组织专业队伍下乡，把技术送上门，有目的地解决生产上的关键性问题。今年10月，广东有些地区的水稻发生粘虫为害，我们及时组织了两个专业队到韶关和湛江专区，研究粘虫的有效防治措施，提出六六六和滴滴涕混细砂撒布稻田的办法来杀虫，既节省了滴滴涕，又提高了劳动效率，有效地制止了粘虫的灾害。在兽医方面，我们经常组织专业队伍下乡研究各种畜病治疗方法，并替公社家畜治病，深受群众欢迎。
    高等农业院校必须有自己开展科学活动的基地，使研究工作与成果推广工作密切结合起来，既用科学技术支援基地的生产，又从基地的生产中吸取丰富的实践经验，总结上升为理论。华南农学院的科学活动基地除自己所有的一个规模比较大的农场外，还在七个公社设立了基点。例如我们最近在南海县大沥公社的基点，和公社干部协作，利用放射性同位素研究小麦吸收磷肥的规律。
    三年来，我们高等农业院校在农业科学研究上取得的成绩是巨大的，但在全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的新形势下，决不能满足于已有的成就。高等农业院校科学研究的潜力是很大的，只要我们坚决贯彻教学、生产劳动和科学研究三结合的方针，大搞群众性的科学研究运动，坚持理论联系实际的方针，我们一定能够发挥更大的力量来支援农业，保证农业生产的持续跃进！
