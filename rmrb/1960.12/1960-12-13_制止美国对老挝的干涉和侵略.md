Stop the US Intervention and Aggression Against Laos
By Our Staff Commentator

Laotian patriotic and progressive forces and the broad masses of the Laotian people, in order to defend the fruits of the August 9th coup, maintain the policy of peace, neutrality, and national harmony, and in the course of repeated and sharp struggles against US imperialism and its running dogs, have achieved a new victory. The revolutionary soldiers and other patriotic officers, soldiers, police, and civil servants led by Captain Kong Le, Chairman of the Laotian Coup Committee, with the support of the broad masses of the people, thwarted on December 8th the conspiracy of a small group of rebels headed by Kou Voravong, commander of the Fifth Military Region of Laos, to create riots in Vientiane and usurp the political power of the Kingdom of Laos.

This rebellion occurred at a time when the troops of the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group were attacking Vientiane, the capital of Laos, with the support of US imperialism and the Thai reactionary authorities, and was supported by paratrooper forces landed by the rebels. This fully exposes that this Vientiane rebellion was an integral part of the US imperialist-directed plan for the Nosavan rebel group to occupy Vientiane and was a new adventure in the escalating US intervention and aggression against Laos, seeking to overthrow the legitimate government of the Kingdom of Laos and establish a pro-US puppet government. Therefore, US imperialism and the Thai reactionary government will never reconcile themselves to this failure. They are stepping up the manipulation of the Nosavan rebel army to gather forces and prepare for a new attack on Vientiane. Vientiane is in a critical situation.

Due to the rampant intervention and aggression by US imperialism, the sovereignty of the Laotian people has been trampled upon, the independence of Laos is under serious threat, and the Laotian people's strong desire to pursue a policy of peace and neutrality and achieve national harmony has been obstructed. The situation in Laos is unprecedentedly serious.

Laotian patriotic and progressive forces and the broad masses of the Laotian people are further mobilizing, uniting closely, and opposing the attacks of US imperialism and domestic reactionaries. The Central Committee of the Laotian Patriotic Front called on all the Laotian people, whether farmers, workers, youths, students, merchants, soldiers, police, civil servants, patriotic gentlemen, and monks, to unite and cooperate with the government army and the armed forces of the Lao Fighting Units to resolutely oppose the intervention and aggression of US imperialism and the Thai reactionaries, resolutely defeat all the rebellious activities of the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group, and resolutely support the policy of peace, neutrality, and national harmony.

Since the August 9th coup in Laos, US imperialism has been colluding with the Thai reactionary government and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to use Laotian reactionaries to bring Laos back under its control. US imperialism has placed its bet on the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group, providing the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group with a large number of US-made weapons, including the 105mm US-made cannons, 120mm mortars, M24 tanks, gunboats, and helicopters for correcting bombing targets currently used by the rebels. American aircraft, piloted by American and Chiang Kai-shek group pilots, are constantly transporting weapons and war materials to rebels in Savannakhet, Xieng Khouang, Luang Prabang, and other places. US military personnel even directly participate in commanding the Nosavan rebel army in combat. Four US military officers were found in a US-made reconnaissance plane shot down over the southern airspace of the Kading River. Thailand has become a base for the Phoumi Nosavan rebel army to attack Vientiane and carry out military activities. Thai, Ngo Dinh Diem, and Chiang Kai-shek group soldiers have even infiltrated the Nosavan rebel army. Thai Deputy Police Commander Major General San even directly helped the Nosavan group attack Vientiane, and Thai artillery openly participated in the battle, bombarding the Laotian government army from Thai territory.

The increasingly rampant US imperialist intervention and aggression against Laos has seriously threatened the peace of Indochina and Southeast Asia. A spokesman for the Central Committee of the Laotian Patriotic Front issued a statement on the 10th, severely condemning the US imperialists and Thai reactionaries for their brutal intervention and aggression against Laos, and demanding that all peace-loving and just people in the world and the governments of all countries that respect international law resolutely denounce and oppose the illegal and unlawful actions of US imperialism and Thai reactionaries, and support the Laotian people's struggle for peace, neutrality, democracy, justice.

China, as a participating country in the Geneva Conference on the Indochina issue and as a neighbor of Laos, cannot but express its great indignation at the criminal activities of US imperialism and its Thai servants in interfering in the internal affairs of Laos. The Chinese people firmly support the statement of the Laotian Patriotic Front and call on the governments of the countries concerned of the Geneva Conference, the governments and peoples of Asian countries, and all peace-loving people around the world to take immediate action to resolutely stop the criminal acts of aggression and interference by US imperialism and Thai reactionaries against Laos.

    制止美国对老挝的干涉和侵略
    本报评论员
    老挝爱国进步力量和老挝广大人民，为保卫8月9日政变胜利的果实、维护和平中立和民族和睦政策，在同美帝国主义及其走狗进行反复的、尖锐的斗争中，又取得了一次新的胜利。老挝政变委员会主席贡勒大尉率领的革命士兵和其他爱国官兵、警察、公务员在广大人民的支持下，12月8日挫败了以老挝第五军区司令库·帕西·阿贝为首的一小撮叛乱分子在万象制造暴乱、篡夺老挝王国政权的阴谋。
    这次叛乱，发生在富米·诺萨万叛乱集团的部队在美帝国主义和泰国反动当局支持下进攻老挝首都万象的时刻，并且得到了叛军降落的伞兵部队的支援。这就完全暴露了这次万象叛乱，是美帝国主义指使诺萨万叛乱集团攻占万象作战计划的一个组成部分，也是美帝国主义对老挝的干涉和侵略活动变本加厉，亟图推翻老挝王国的合法政府、成立亲美的傀儡政府的阴谋所进行的一次新冒险。因此，美帝国主义和泰国反动政府决不会甘心于这次失败的。他们正加紧操纵诺萨万叛军调集兵力，准备对万象发动新的进攻。万象已处于危急之中。
    由于美帝国主义的猖狂干涉和侵略，老挝人民的主权遭到了蹂躏，老挝的独立受到严重的威胁，老挝人民要求奉行和平中立政策、实现民族和睦的强烈愿望，遇到阻挠。老挝的局势空前严重。
    老挝爱国进步力量和老挝广大人民，正进一步动员起来，紧密团结，反对美帝国主义和国内反动派的进攻。老挝爱国战线党中央委员会号召老挝全体人民，无论农民、工人、青年、学生、商人、士兵、警察、公务员、爱国绅士和僧侣，共同起来同政府军队和寮国战斗部队武装力量合作，坚决反对美帝国主义和泰国反动派的干涉和侵略，坚决击败富米·诺萨万叛乱集团的一切叛乱活动，坚决支持和平中立和民族和睦政策。
    自从8月9日老挝政变以来，美帝国主义就一直利用泰国反动政府和吴庭艳集团勾结老挝反动派，要把老挝重新置于它的控制之下。美帝国主义把它的赌注押在富米·诺萨万叛乱集团身上，向富米·诺萨万叛乱集团提供了大量美式武器，其中包括叛军目前正在使用的105毫米的美式大炮、120毫米的迫击炮、M24型坦克、炮艇，以及校正轰击目标的直升飞机等。由美国和蒋介石集团驾驶员驾驶的美国飞机，不断向沙湾拿吉、川圹、琅勃拉邦和其他各地的叛乱分子输送武器和战争物资。美国军事人员甚至直接参加指挥诺萨万叛军作战。在卡定河南面上空被击落的一架美制侦察机中，就有四名美国军官。泰国已成为富米·诺萨万叛军进攻万象和进行军事活动的基地，泰国、吴庭艳和蒋介石集团的军人，甚至混入诺萨万叛军，泰国警察副司令山少将甚至直接帮助诺萨万集团进攻万象，泰国的炮兵公然参加作战，从泰国境内轰击老挝政府军。
    美帝国主义对老挝越来越猖狂的干涉和侵略，已经严重地威胁着印度支那和东南亚的和平。老挝爱国战线党中央委员会发言人10日发表声明，严厉谴责美帝国主义和泰国反动派粗暴干涉和侵略老挝的行为，并要求全世界爱好和平和正义的人民以及尊重国际法的各国政府坚决斥责和反对美帝国主义和泰国反动分子的违法和非法行动，支持老挝人民为和平中立和民主和正义而进行的斗争。
    中国作为关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的参加国，作为老挝的邻邦，对于美帝国主义和它的泰国仆从干涉老挝内政的罪恶活动，不能不表示极大的愤慨。中国人民坚决支持老挝爱国战线党的声明，呼吁日内瓦会议各有关国家的政府，亚洲各国的政府和人民，全世界一切爱好和平的人民，立即行动起来，坚决制止美帝国主义和泰国反动派侵略和干涉老挝的罪恶行动。
