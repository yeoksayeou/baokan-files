Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 14th. On December 13th, Brezhnev, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, signed a directive deciding to posthumously award Viktor Tretyakevich, one of the main organizers of the Young Communist League underground organization "Young Guards," who heroically fought against the fascist bandits and died a heroic death, with the Order of the Patriotic War, First Class.

Tretyakevich remained in Krasnodon to carry out underground work for the youth organization according to a resolution of the Young Communist League Oblast Committee Standing Committee. In 1942, he, together with Levashov, Koshevoy, Zemnukhov, Turenin, and others, founded the world-famous "Young Guards" and was appointed commissar at the first meeting of the organization's headquarters. He actively participated in all the activities of the Guards and led many struggles.

In January 1943, he was arrested along with Zemnukhov and others. Tretyakevich remained unyielding in the face of the enemy's cruel torture, demonstrating unparalleled heroism. When he and a group of team members were taken to be executed, he mustered his last strength and fought against the fascist bandits. The executioners were panicked by this fearless youth and, without having time to shoot him, pushed him into a mine shaft eighty meters deep.

The heroic deeds of Tretyakevich's martyrdom were only known to people sixteen years later, after careful study and investigation. It turned out that after his martyrdom, the fascists had despicably spread rumors that he had betrayed his comrades. After the victory, a man named Rivleshov, who had worked in the German police station at the time, also fabricated that Tretyakevich had betrayed the Young Guards during his trial.

It was not until recently, when the hidden traitor, Podtyony, who had defected to the enemy and served as the deputy director of the Krasnodon City Police Department, was exposed, that the truth came to light. The interrogation revealed that the traitor Pochiptsov was the one who brought down the "Young Guards." This traitor was the first to point out Tretyakevich's name.

The heroic deeds of the "Young Guards" in fighting against the fascist bandits were recorded in Fadeyev's novel of the same name. The novel did not mention Tretyakevich.

### “青年近卫军”一烈士恢复荣誉  苏联最高苏维埃主席团追授他一级卫国战争勋章

    “青年近卫军”一烈士恢复荣誉
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团追授他一级卫国战争勋章
    据新华社莫斯科14日电　苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席勃列日涅夫13日签署了一项指令，决定追授给英勇打击法西斯匪徒壮烈牺牲的共青团地下组织“青年近卫军”的主要组织者之一维克托·特列季雅克维奇以一级卫国战争勋章。
    特列季雅克维奇是根据共青团州委会常委的决议留在克拉斯诺顿作青年地下组织工作的。1942年他同列瓦绍夫、科谢沃伊、泽姆努霍夫、图列宁等人一起创立了世界闻名的“青年近卫军”，并且在这个组织的总部的第一次会议上被任命为政委。他积极参加了近卫军的全部活动，领导了许多斗争。
    1943年1月他同泽姆努霍夫等人一道被捕。特列季雅克维奇在敌人的残酷拷问前忠贞不屈，表现了无比的英勇气慨。当他和一批队员被带去处死时他鼓起最后的力量同法西斯强盗展开了搏斗。刽子手们被这个无畏的青年吓慌了，没来得及把他枪决，就把他推下了深达八十米的矿井里。
    特列季雅克维奇英勇殉国的事迹隔了十六年后，经过仔细研究和侦查才为人们所知道。原来在他殉国后，法西斯分子曾卑鄙地散布谣言说是他出卖了自己的同志。胜利后，当时曾在德寇警察局工作的一个叫里夫列绍夫受审时，也捏造说特列季雅克维奇出卖了近卫军。
    一直到不很久以前，当揭发出隐藏的叛徒、当时投敌担任克拉斯诺顿市警察局副局长的波德提内依后才真相大白。审讯结果知道，断送“青年近卫军”的是叛徒波契普佐夫。这个叛徒第一个指出了特列季雅克维奇的名字。
    “青年近卫军”的英勇打击法西斯匪徒的事迹为法捷耶夫的同名小说记载了下来。小说中没有提到特列季雅克维奇。
