Ode to Worker-Peasant Essays
Sha Ying

    The number of worker-peasant essays published in newspapers and periodicals across the country is increasing day by day. Party propaganda departments and publishing houses in various regions have also published many collections of worker-peasant essays. As for essays published on wall newspapers and mimeographed publications in factories, rural areas, and military units, they are too numerous to count. Worker-peasant essays are not only abundant in quantity, but many of them are indeed well-written, possessing many unique characteristics and advantages, radiating flashes of genius. They are like newly blooming flowers in spring, fresh and tender, colorful and vibrant, full of vigorous vitality, growing stronger, more lush, and more beautiful day by day.

    Advanced workers and peasants moving from learning culture and theory to writing essays, and some even writing books, is a major event in our political life and something that has never happened in our history. We must not underestimate its significance. It signifies the increasing cultural level and political awareness of the broad masses of workers and peasants, and the great development of noble communist style; at the same time, it also signifies that our theoretical study movement is developing in depth, and that Marxism-Leninism and the works of Chairman Mao are being widely disseminated and deeply rooted in people's hearts. If it is said that worker-peasant universities studying theory and writing essays are products of the Great Leap Forward situation, then it will in turn have a huge effect on socialist construction. Marx said that once theory grasps the masses, it will produce material force. Mao Zedong Thought is the spiritual condition for overcoming all enemies and difficulties. Not only the vast number of cadres, but also the vast number of advanced workers and peasants actively studying Mao Zedong Thought, is a great spiritual condition for the victorious advance of our socialist cause.

    Faced with this new phenomenon, how should we view it and how should we estimate it? Comrades Guo Moruo and Zhou Yang regarded new folk songs as "the budding of mass communist literature and art" and "the new national character of the socialist era," thus enthusiastically praising the new folk songs of the worker-peasant masses. (See "Editor's Remarks" in the book "Red Flag Ballads") We should adopt the same attitude towards worker-peasant essays.

    The worker-peasant masses break superstitions, dare to think and act, study theory at universities, and then write essays in large numbers; this is the right thing to do, and it is a very good thing! On the one hand, they actively and humbly study, striving to understand the spirit and essence of books; on the other hand, they combine political struggle, ideological reality, and production practice, using theory to analyze, summarize experience, solve problems in their thoughts, work, and production, and write essays to raise the problems to the theoretical level for argumentation and development. This learning method is correct, their learning achievements are not bad, and the essays they write are very outstanding. Towards new things like worker-peasant essays, we can only praise, encourage, and support them; we cannot be indifferent, let alone adopt a mocking attitude.

    What are the characteristics and advantages of worker-peasant essays?

    Being clear about what to support and what to oppose, distinguishing right from wrong, and having clear viewpoints. Being promoters of revolution and opposing regressives, without any ambiguity and with a firm stand, this is the most prominent feature of worker-peasant essays. They all strive to use Mao Zedong Thought to observe and explain problems, calling "Mao Zedong Thought the golden key to solving all problems," and resolutely expressing that "we will act according to Mao Zedong Thought." They wholeheartedly support the Three Red Banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and enthusiastically respond to all calls from the Party and the government. Whether in political struggles or production struggles, they take a master's attitude, doing their best to publicize and safeguard the interests of the country and the collective, and actively refute and criticize views and behaviors that violate the Party's policies. The workers of the Mudanjiang Cement Plant once wrote more than 30 essays, such as "Sixty Benefits of the Great Leap Forward," "Protect the General Line as We Protect Our Own Eyes," "People's Communes Are Just Great," "Marxist-Leninists Are Nurturers of New Things," and "Hold High the Red Banner of Revolutionary Mass Movements and Advance Courageously," in response to various evil winds and absurd arguments, and waged a victorious struggle against various fallacies. In the anti-Rightist rectification movement of 1959, the workers of the Shanghai Qiuxin Shipyard wrote many articles, targeting erroneous arguments that contradicted the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, such as "reaching the peak," "tension," "suffering losses," "seeing things but not people," and "putting technology and business in command," making powerful criticisms, persuading many people, and thereby promoting the continued leap forward of the factory. Such examples are numerous everywhere. In short, under the banner of "promoting the proletarian and eliminating the bourgeois," they resolutely struggle against bourgeois ideology, consolidating and expanding the theoretical position of Marxism-Leninism.

    Consistency between learning and application, and close integration of theory with practice, is another characteristic of worker-peasant essays. The content of worker-peasant essays is mostly based on the needs of the current struggle, raising problems, analyzing them, clarifying them through specific examples in their own factories, cooperatives, and stores, and giving solutions, directly conducting theoretical propaganda for the Party's tasks and policies. Some articles use the abstract to bring out the concrete, and some articles discuss the abstract from the concrete, truly combining the abstract and the concrete, with flesh and blood. They have no empty and abstract phrases, nor do they have the bookishness of mechanically reciting nouns and playing with concepts. These essays reflect the excellent situation of the Great Leap Forward in recent years, express the thoughts, feelings, and desires of the broad masses, and promote socialist revolution and socialist construction. After studying atheism, the masses of Sanguanmiao Township in Henan Province launched a movement throughout the township to break superstitions. The Mao Zedong Works Study Group of the 7th Department Store in Harbin, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, studied the work of salespeople and wrote special essays such as "The Communist Style of Salespeople," "The Service Attitude of Salespeople," and "The Language Art of Salespeople," and compiled them into a book entitled "Salespeople Research." Comrade Dan Shu of the Tianjin No. 1 Steel Rolling Plant consciously applied the principle of despising difficulties strategically and valuing difficulties tactically, and applied the working method of the mass line, successively proposing fifteen major technological innovations and creations, which played a major role in the plant's completion of its production plan.

    Another characteristic of worker-peasant essays is that they are full of philosophical implications, shining with the brilliance of materialism and dialectics. They boldly use Marxist-Leninist philosophy to observe and explain problems, especially paying attention to using the ideas of Comrade Mao Zedong's works such as "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" to analyze things, resolutely opposing idealism and metaphysics. For example, how is the relationship between knowledge and practice, what is the driving force of the development of things, how to analyze contradictions and how to grasp the main contradiction, what is the relationship between objective laws and subjective initiative, how to combine scientific spirit and revolutionary enthusiasm, and so on, such complex issues are all discussed, and they are said very vividly and concretely; there is analysis and synthesis; there are materials and viewpoints. The students of the Red and Expert School for Cadres in Sanguanmiao Township, Dengfeng County, Henan Province, wrote a poem entitled "Philosophy is Not Difficult," which reads: "Learning philosophy is not difficult, we must remember both the subjective and the objective; materialism and idealism are opposing, matter and spirit are two aspects; we must look at things dialectically, and development comes from the unity of opposites." That's right, philosophy is not difficult! Dialectical materialism is the worldview of the working class, and the working people and peasants are rich in experience in class struggle and production struggle, so it is relatively easy to accept this worldview. In worker-peasant essays, the mystical view of philosophy is greatly broken, and some philosophical principles are greatly popularized, so that it is truly combined with work and life. Such as "walking on two legs," "the whole country as one chessboard," "balance and imbalance," "wave-like advance," "combining the theory of continuous revolution with the theory of revolutionary stages," "the relationship between nine fingers and one finger," "grasping both ends and bringing along the middle," "combining work and rest," and so on, they are all explained reasonably, deeply, and simply with popular language. It is very touching to read. Isn't it a miracle that workers and peasants talk about philosophy and write philosophical essays in large numbers? Marx once said: "Philosophy regards the proletariat as its material weapon, and similarly, the proletariat regards philosophy as its spiritual weapon." (Introduction to "Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right") That's right, the working people and peasants are using philosophy as their spiritual weapon, carrying out the great project of transforming the objective world and transforming the subjective world.

    In many worker-peasant essays, the ideas of human subjective initiative, revolutionary drive, seeking change in poverty, relying on the collective, human effort, and man will conquer nature are emphasized, and they are full of enthusiasm, high morale, and full of collectivism and revolutionary optimism; at the same time, they also emphasize a clear mind, investigation and research, specific analysis, dissecting sparrows, telling the truth, advocating seeing things and people, combining coldness and enthusiasm, and combining points and surfaces. That is to say, it is not only full of combat effectiveness, but also full of the spirit of seeking truth from facts, which is also a significant characteristic of worker-peasant essays.

    The characteristic of worker-peasant essays in writing style is that the style is short and the language is vivid. The number of words in general articles is mostly around one or two thousand words, and they are concise, clear, simple, and powerful, without problems such as aimlessness, emptiness, length and emptiness, gorgeousness and impracticality, and cumbersomeness and obscurity, so they are easy to understand and approachable. They have a lively, fresh, and powerful Marxist writing style, which is truly loved by the masses. Comrade Mao Zedong said in the article "Inaugural Message of 'Chinese Workers'": "I hope this newspaper will be run well, publish more vivid words, and avoid being rigid, old-fashioned, incomprehensible, tasteless, and uninspiring." I think worker-peasant essays are exactly such words, and newspapers and periodicals should publish more of them.

    Because many worker-peasant essays have these characteristics and advantages, they are not only loved by the worker-peasant masses, but also liked by cadres and intellectuals. Really, if we can put down our airs, have the spirit of willingly being a primary school student, and often read worker-peasant essays, our thinking will be greatly enlightened and nourished, and we will feel relaxed and open-minded.

    Of course, worker-peasant essays are not without shortcomings. Some articles are relatively rough, the reasoning is not thorough enough, and some even have unclear grammar and errors, which are inevitable. Naturally, the shortcomings of worker-peasant essays are not immune to criticism, but the problem is to proceed from reality and from the perspective of caring, encouraging, and supporting.

    There are both popularization and improvement issues in workers and peasants writing essays. Now only a small number of people are writing. With the development of the cultural revolution and theoretical study, more and more people will pick up their pens. On the basis of this popularization, there will naturally be improvement. Popularization and improvement are closely linked dialectical relationships. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The people demand popularization, and then they also demand improvement, demanding improvement year by year and month by month." "Our improvement is an improvement based on popularization; our popularization is a popularization under the guidance of improvement." (Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art) We firmly believe that as more and more worker-peasant essays appear in large numbers, many excellent works will be born continuously. This is a process from nothing to something, from less to more, from low to high, from rough to refined. Whether it is popularization or improvement, it mainly relies on the efforts of the worker-peasant masses and gives full play to collective wisdom, but it also needs help and guidance. Now the Party, trade unions, and Communist Youth League organizations in various regions attach great importance to this work, which is very correct. At the same time, they need more people's care. For example, cadres sent to lower levels, newspaper and periodical editors, theoretical instructors, and theoretical workers should all have the responsibility to do their best to help them when conditions permit. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Our literary experts should pay attention to the wall newspapers of the masses, and pay attention to the communication literature in the army and the countryside. Our drama experts should pay attention to the small troupes in the army and the countryside. Our music experts should pay attention to the singing of the masses. Our art experts should pay attention to the art of the masses. All these comrades should have close contact with the comrades who are doing popularization of literature and art among the masses, on the one hand helping them and guiding them, and on the other hand learning from them, absorbing nourishment from the masses, enriching themselves, and making their specialties not become air castles that are separated from the masses, separated from reality, devoid of content, and devoid of life." (Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art) Don't these valuable instructions to literary workers also fully apply to theoretical workers? It should be pointed out that some theoretical workers are not giving enough care and help to workers and peasants studying theory and writing essays, which needs to be strengthened in the future.

    Building socialism and communism requires cultivating a strong theoretical team. The composition of this theoretical team requires a group of full-time theoretical workers as the core force, but cultivating a group of "red scholars" with theoretical cultivation from workers and peasants is an indispensable part of the theoretical team. We believe that under the cultivation of the Party and with the help of all parties, a group of theoretical workers and theorists who are both red and expert will be produced from the worker-peasant masses in the future. Today's worker-peasant essays are just a good start, just a seedling of a new thing. Although there are still many difficulties on the road ahead, their future is infinitely bright! For the worker and peasant comrades who are just learning to write, with the Party's enthusiastic care and help, they should establish lofty ambitions, strive to become stronger, overcome all difficulties, study diligently, and strive to cultivate themselves into cultured laborers with socialist consciousness, and have the determination and perseverance to climb the peak of Marxist-Leninist theory, and write many new and beautiful articles!

    工农论文赞
    沙英
    各地报刊发表的工农论文一天天多起来了。各地党的宣传部门和出版社也出版了许多工农论文集。至于在工厂、农村、部队的墙报上和油印刊物上发表的论文，那就多得不可胜数了。工农论文不仅数量很多，而且其中确有不少文章写得很好，具有很多的特色和优点，放射着天才的闪光。它们就有如春天初放的花朵，花鲜叶嫩，万紫千红，充满了旺盛的生命力，日益茁壮、繁茂和艳丽。
    先进的工农分子从学文化、学理论到大写论文，有的甚至著书立说，这是我们政治生活中的一件大事，也是我国历史上从来没有过的事情。我们绝不能低估它的意义。它标志着广大工农群众的文化水平和政治觉悟日益提高，崇高的共产主义风格大大发扬；同时它也标志着我们的理论学习运动正向纵深发展，马克思列宁主义和毛主席著作正在广为传播和日益深入人心。如果说，工农大学理论、大写论文是在大跃进形势下的产物，那么它反过来又会对社会主义建设发生巨大的作用。马克思说过，理论一旦掌握群众，就会产生物质力量。毛泽东思想是战胜一切敌人和困难的精神条件。不仅广大干部，而且广大的先进工农分子积极学习毛泽东思想，这是我们社会主义事业胜利前进的一个伟大的精神条件。
    面对着这个新事物，怎样看待它，怎样估计它呢？郭沫若、周扬同志把新民歌看作是“群众共产主义文艺的萌芽”，是“社会主义时代的新国风”，从而热情百倍地赞扬了工农群众的新民歌。（见《红旗歌谣》一书《编者的话》）我们对待工农论文，同样也要抱这种态度。
    工农群众破除迷信，敢想敢干，大学理论，进而大写论文，是做得对，是好得很！他们一方面积极地、虚心地学习，努力领会书本的精神和实质；一方面就结合政治斗争、思想实际和生产实践，运用理论进行分析，总结经验，解决思想中、工作中和生产中的问题，而且写出论文，把问题提到理论上加以论证，加以发挥。这种学习方法是正确的，他们学习的成绩是不坏的，他们写出的论文是很出色的。对待工农论文这样的新生事物，只能赞扬，只能鼓励和扶植；不能冷淡，更不能采取讥笑的态度。
    工农论文有哪些特色和优点呢？
    赞成什么，反对什么，是非分明，观点鲜明。做革命的促进派，反对促退派，毫不含糊，立场十分坚定，这是工农论文最突出的一个特点。他们都努力运用毛泽东思想来观察和解释问题，称“毛泽东思想是解决一切问题的金钥匙”，坚决表示“按照毛泽东思想办事”。他们竭诚拥护总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三面红旗，热烈响应党和政府的一切号召。不论在政治斗争和生产斗争中，他们都是以主人翁的态度，对于国家的和集体的利益尽力加以宣传和维护，对于违反党的政策的观点和行为积极地反驳和批评。牡丹江水泥厂的职工，曾经针对着各种阴风邪气和许多荒谬的论调，写出了《大跃进好处六十条》、《像保卫自己眼睛一样保卫总路线》、《人民公社就是好》、《马克思列宁主义者是新鲜事物的抚育者》、《高举革命的群众运动的红旗奋勇前进》等三十多篇论文，同各种谬论进行了胜利的斗争。上海求新造船厂的工人们，在1959年的反右倾整风运动中，写出许多文章，针对“到顶论”、“紧张论”、“吃亏论”、“见物不见人”、“技术业务挂帅”等与总路线、大跃进相抵触的错误论点，作了有力的批驳，说服了许多人，从而推动了该厂的继续跃进。像这样的例子，到处都很多，举不胜举。总之，它们在“兴无灭资”的旗帜下，坚决与资产阶级思想作斗争，巩固和扩大了马克思列宁主义的理论阵地。
    学用一致，理论密切联系实践，是工农论文的又一个特点。工农论文的内容，大都是根据当前斗争的需要，提出问题，进行分析，通过本厂、本社、本商店中的具体事例，加以阐明，给以解决，直接为党的任务和政策进行理论宣传。有的文章是以虚带实，有的文章是就实论虚，真是虚实结合，有血有肉。它们没有空洞抽象的调头，也没有死扣名词和玩弄概念的书生气味。这些论文，反映了几年来大跃进的大好形势，表现了广大群众的思想、情感和愿望，推动了社会主义革命和社会主义建设。河南省三官庙乡的群众，在学习了无神论以后，掀起了全乡破除迷信的运动。哈尔滨市第七百货商店的毛泽东著作学习小组，在毛泽东思想指导下，研究了售货员的工作，写出了《售货员的共产主义风格》、《售货员的服务态度》、《售货员的语言艺术》等专题论文，并把它们汇集成《售货员研究》一书。天津轧钢一厂的单书同志，自觉地运用在战略上藐视困难，在战术上重视困难的原理，并且运用群众路线的工作方法，连续提出了十五项重大的技术革新创造，对该厂完成生产计划起了重大的作用。
    工农论文的又一特点，是富有哲学意味，闪烁着唯物论和辩证法的光辉。他们大胆运用马克思列宁主义的哲学来观察和解释问题，特别是注意运用毛泽东同志的《实践论》和《矛盾论》等著作的思想来分析事物，坚决反对唯心论和形而上学。例如认识与实践的关系如何，什么是事物发展的动力，怎样分析矛盾和怎样抓住主要矛盾，客观规律和主观能动性的关系是怎样的，怎样把科学精神和革命热情结合起来，等等，像这样一些复杂的问题，都在议论之列，而且说的很生动，很具体；有分析，有综合；有材料，有观点。河南登封县三官庙乡干部红专学校的学生们写了一首题为《哲学并不难》的诗，诗曰：“学习哲学并不难，主观客观要记全；唯物唯心是对头，物质精神两方面；遇事必须辩证看，矛盾统一就发展。”正是这样，哲学并不难！辩证唯物论是工人阶级的世界观，而且工农劳动人民富有阶级斗争和生产斗争的经验，所以是比较容易接受这种世界观的。在工农论文中，大破哲学的神秘观点，把一些哲学原理大大地通俗化了，使它同工作和生活真正地结合起来了。诸如“两条腿走路”，“全国一盘棋”，“平衡与不平衡”，“波浪式前进”，“不断革命论与革命阶段论相结合”，“九个指头与一个指头的关系”，“抓两头带中间”，“劳逸结合”，等等问题，都被他们用通俗的语言解释得入情入理，深入浅出。读起来令人十分感动。工农大谈哲学，大写哲学论文，这难道不是一个奇迹吗？从前马克思说过：“哲学把无产阶级当做自己的物质武器，同样地，无产阶级也把哲学当做自己的精神武器。”（《黑格尔法哲学批判导言》）正是这样，工农劳动人民正把哲学当做自己的精神武器，进行着改造客观世界和改造主观世界的伟大工程。
    在许多工农论文中，都强调人的主观能动性、革命干劲、穷则思变、依靠集体、事在人为、人定胜天的思想，而且热情洋溢，斗志昂扬，充满了集体主义和革命的乐观主义；同时它们也强调清醒的头脑、调查研究、具体分析、解剖麻雀、说老实话，主张见物又见人，冷热结合，点面结合。这就是说，既富有战斗性，又充满了实事求是的精神，这也是工农论文的一个显著的特点。
    工农论文在文风上的特点，是文体短小，语言生动。一般文章的字数大都在一两千字左右，而且讲得简洁明了，朴素有力，没有无的放矢、言之无物、长而且空、华而不实、繁琐晦涩等毛病，所以读起来通俗易懂，平易近人。它们具有生动活泼、新鲜有力的马克思主义的文风，真正为群众所喜闻乐见。毛泽东同志在“《中国工人》发刊词”一文中说：“我希望这个报纸好好地办下去，多载些生动的文字，切忌死板、老套，令人看不懂，没味道，不起劲。”我想，工农论文正是这样的文字，报刊应当多登载。
    由于许多工农论文具有这些特色和优点，所以不仅为工农群众所爱读，而且干部和知识分子也都很喜欢它。真的，如果我们能放下架子，有甘当小学生的精神，经常读读工农论文，就会使我们的思想得到许多的启发和滋补，感到心情舒畅，眼界开阔。
    当然，工农论文并不是没有缺点的，有些文章比较粗糙，说理还不大透彻，有的甚至还有文理不大清顺和错误的地方，这都是难免的。自然，工农论文的缺点也不是不能批评的，但问题在于要从实际出发，要从爱护、鼓励和扶植的观点出发。
    工农写论文，既有普及的问题，也有提高的问题。现在还只是一少部分人在写，随着文化革命和理论学习的发展，必将有越来越多的人拿起笔来。在这种普及的基础上，自然也就会提高。普及与提高是密切相联的辩证关系。毛泽东同志说：“人民要求普及，跟着也就要求提高，要求逐年逐月地提高。”“我们的提高，是在普及基础上的提高；我们的普及，是在提高指导下的普及。”（《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》）我们深信，随着工农论文越来越多地大量出现，许多优秀的作品就会源源而生。这是一个由无到有，由少到多，由低到高，由粗到精的过程。不论普及也好，不论提高也好，这固然主要地依靠工农群众的努力，充分发挥集体的智慧，但是也需要加以帮助和指导。现在各地的党、工会和共青团等组织，都十分重视这一工作，这是很对的。同时，它们还需要更多的人的关怀，例如下放干部、报刊编辑、理论教员和理论工作者等，都应该有责任，在条件许可的情况下，尽力地帮助他们。毛泽东同志说：“我们的文学专门家应该注意群众的墙报，注意军队和农村中的通讯文学。我们的戏剧专门家应该注意军队和农村中的小剧团。我们的音乐专门家应该注意群众的歌唱。我们的美术专门家应该注意群众的美术。一切这些同志都应该和在群众中做文艺普及工作的同志们发生密切的联系，一方面帮助他们，指导他们，一方面又向他们学习，从他们吸收由群众中来的养料，把自己充实起来，丰富起来，使自己的专门不成其为脱离群众、脱离实际、毫无内容、毫无生气的空中楼阁。”（《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》）这些对文艺工作者的宝贵指示，难道不也完全适用于理论工作者吗？应当指出，目前有些理论工作者，对于工农学理论和写论文的关怀和帮助，是不够的，今后需要加强。
    建设社会主义和共产主义，需要培养一支强大的理论队伍。这支理论队伍的组成，需要一批专职的理论工作者为核心力量，但是从工农中培养一批有理论修养的“红秀才”，是理论队伍不可缺少的一个组成部分。我们相信，在党的培养之下，在各方面的帮助之下，将来从工农群众中会产生一批又红又专的理论工作者和理论家。今天的工农论文，只是一个良好的开端，只是一种新事物的幼芽，在前进的道路上固然还有许多困难，但是它们的前途是无限光明的！对于初学写作的工农同志来说，在党的热情关怀和帮助之下，应该树立雄心壮志，发愤图强，克服一切困难，刻苦学习，努力把自己培养成为一个具有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，并且有攀登马克思列宁主义理论高峰的决心和毅力，写出许多又新又美的文章！
