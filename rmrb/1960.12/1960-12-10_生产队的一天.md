    A Day in the Production Team
    Hu Benying
    Although the season has entered winter, the actual weather is still the "Little Spring" of October. The Fanglan Lake Brigade of the Jiangnan People's Commune in Yiyang County, Hunan Province, which is close to the Zi River, has stored its golden late rice, and the boundless green manure has stretched its waist. Added to this are the wheat, broad beans, and vegetables on the lake harbors, canal embankments, and fields, all lush and green, thriving, showing no sign of winter at all.
          Singing in Response
    The dawn rises, and the mist over White Water Lake dissipates. On the wide, golden, sparkling lake surface, the boats harvesting black grass weave back and forth busily; on the grassy shore, the women hoeing grass turf swing their silver hoes, laughter filling the air. These are the members of the first work team of the White Water Lake Production Team, seizing the time to prepare enough fertilizer for a bumper harvest next year.
    In the heart of the lake, a short, stout, dark-skinned, man stands steadily at the bow of a boat, his sleeves and trouser legs rolled up high, his hands wielding a grass rake, making the water gurgle. This is Comrade Leng Yunchang, the Party Branch Secretary. On the grassy shore, a young woman with a face that is black but with a hint of redness, a white towel tied around her head, and a red floral cotton jacket, bends over, hoeing the turf with all her might. She is Xue Xizhen, Secretary Leng's wife.
    Leng Yunchang's boat sailed across the heart of the lake, deftly scooping up a large handful of black grass, just as the boat of young member Chai Dongshan swiftly followed. Old Leng glanced at his partner in the neighboring boat and said happily, "Dongshan! Come on, let's show off to the 'Mu Guiyings' on the shore!"
    "Okay!" Dongshan said, raising his voice to sing a melodious song:
    When the sun comes out, the sky is red,
    The grass-cutting boat is fast as the wind,
    Reminding the Mu Guiyings on the shore,
    We are determined to win first place.
    "He ho he ho! He ho he ho!" Leng Yunchang and the male members cutting grass cheered in unison.
    Hearing this, Xizhen on the shore hurriedly discussed it with several female companions beside her for a while, and then sang a clear mountain song:
    Hoes are waved without stopping work,
    Grass turf piles up deep,
    Tell the men in the lake,
    We'll win this competition!
    "He ho he ho! He ho he ho!" The women around Xizhen also joined in the battle.
    The morning sun dyed White Water Lake red, people were sweating, and songs and laughter floated back and forth on the lake and shore...
        In the Dining Hall
    The bell for lunch rang. The members of the Red Flag Dining Hall of the Shangdukǒu Production Team walked into the dining hall, chatting and laughing, finding the tables wiped clean, the benches arranged neatly, and everything already set on each table. At this time, a middle-aged man wearing a mask and a white apron, his face full of smiles, was carrying a plate of steaming rice to the members' tables. He is Liu Xubo, the newly arrived cook and Deputy Secretary of the Party General Branch of the brigade.
    Old member Tang Yaoxian, who is over sixty years old, saw Secretary Liu at a glance and quickly dissuaded him, "Secretary, you have so much work, don't bother with these small things!"
      "Uncle Yao, the lives of the masses are a major matter, we must take care of it even if we are busy!" Liu Xubo explained with a smile.
    The news of Liu Xubo becoming a cook spread quickly. Old Woman Wang Jia, who is over seventy years old, said while eating her meal, "This meal is really well made: there's both dry and wet, and the barnyard grass and chaff are washed clean. It's still thanks to our secretary for taking charge!" Member Zhang Jufu added, "The dishes are also well made: there are many varieties, and they taste good. Eating such dishes gives us plenty of energy for production!"
    "Uncle Jufu, will we have such good meals in the future?" Little Tang Yaoyi, a primary school student, interjected naively.
    "Yes!" Liu Xubo finished delivering the meals and brought in a load of boiling water. He said enthusiastically, "From today onwards, cadres at all levels in the entire brigade will take turns being cooks in the dining hall, and the meals will get better and better!"
      On the Embankment
    In the evening, the sky was filled with colorful clouds. On both sides of the long abandoned embankment, tender green and robust broad beans and wheat seedlings looked particularly beautiful in the reflection of the sunset and the caress of the breeze. At this time, on the embankment of the second work team of the Maojiayuan Production Team, several members sat barefoot in the wheat field, enthusiastically discussing the day's harvest.
      "This afternoon, five of us completed weeding and topdressing four mu of wheat and peas. Everyone worked very well!" The speaker was a tall, large middle-aged man, he is Leng Shiqun, the Party General Branch Secretary of the brigade.
    "This year's winter grains are contracted to households rationally, and cultivation and management were started early, so exceeding production is assured!" Old farmer Leng Yinglian said happily.
    Leng Shiqun smiled and nodded, changing the subject, "It's almost time to finish work, let's quickly evaluate our work! Today, Uncle Yinglian was responsible for spreading manure, the work efficiency is high, and the quality is good, I suggest giving him a higher score."
    "Also," a woman named Peng Yuzhen interjected, "Secretary Leng carried manure all afternoon, doing heavy work, and never stopped to rest, he should be given an even higher score! Does everyone agree?"
    "Agree!" The members unanimously agreed. Then they all carried out democratic evaluation one by one: Leng Shiqun five points, Uncle Yinglian four and a half points, Peng Yuzhen four points, and the other two women three and a half points. All exceeded the labor quota.
    After the evaluation, Leng Shiqun brushed the mud off his hands, took out a pen and labor manual from his pocket, and habitually filled in his work point figures. At this time, the members packed up their tools and went home happily. Leng Shiqun carried a load of empty manure buckets and walked side by side with Uncle Yinglian, discussing the matter of planting high-yield soil for wheat...
        Evening Performance
    In the evening, the entertainment room of the Shangdukǒu Dining Hall was full of people, and the members were happily playing gongs and drums, playing the piano, and singing under the kerosene lamp.
    In the musical instrument group, there was a remarkable middle-aged man: a white towel tied around his head, wearing blue clothes, a burly figure, a face full of smiles, skillfully playing the large gong. He is Leng Guoxuan, the Deputy Secretary of the Commune Party Committee and the General Branch Secretary of the brigade.
    Leng Guoxuan enthusiastically finished playing the opening gong, surveyed the entire venue, and asked loudly with a smile, "Members, what kind of play do you want to sing tonight?"
    "Sing an excerpt from 'Golden Phoenix Mountain'!" Young lads and girls rushed to suggest the title.
    "No! Sing 'The Card of Life and Death'!" Old men and women expressed different opinions.
    "Okay! We'll sing both! But, let's sing a section that we composed ourselves first." As he spoke, he winked at the two members beside him who were playing the huqin, and the clear sound of the qin immediately filled the room. Immediately afterwards, a young couple raised their voices and sang in the "West Lake Tune":
    The Party's policy is truly brilliant,
    Welcomed by men, women, old, and young.
    Cadres and the masses are of one heart,
    Making production a complete success…
    Leng Guoxuan skillfully played the bamboo clappers beside them, while directing the orchestra and carefully observing the emotions of the audience. The members watched Leng Guoxuan and the performers he led with rapt attention. Countless black-red smiling faces shone under the bright kerosene lamp.
      "We engage in production during the day and watch a play in the evening. That's the perfect combination of work and rest!" Old Man Guixiang knocked his dry tobacco pouch and said to his wife, Old Woman Xiang.
      "The secretary also participates in performing in plays. Such a thing has been rare since ancient times!" Old Woman Xiang glanced at her husband, happy to the point of not knowing what to say.
    "Dong dong qiang! Qiang dong qiang!" After the young couple on stage finished singing a section, the sound of gongs and drums, applause, and laughter all erupted together, and the whole room was filled with jubilation…

    生产队的一天
    胡本莹
    时令虽已入冬，但实际还是十月“小阳春”天气。紧靠资江的湖南省益阳县江南人民公社芳兰湖大队，金黄的晚稻进了仓，无边的绿肥伸了腰；加上那湖港渠堤边的小麦、蚕豆和蔬菜，遍地皆青，欣欣向荣，看不出半点冬天的迹象。
          对　歌
    曙光升起来了，白水湖上的烟雾散了。宽广的、金波灿烂的湖面，打黑草的划子织布穿梭地忙着；湖边的草地上，薅草皮的妇女银锄起落，笑声一片。这是白水湖生产队第一作业组的社员们，在抓紧为明年备足丰产肥料。
    湖心里，有个矮矮敦敦、黑皮黑草的壮年男子稳立船头，衣袖裤管卷起老高，双手舞动着草扒子，打得水咕咚咕咚响。他就是党支部书记冷云昌同志。在湖边的草地上，有个脸上黑里透红、头扎白毛巾、身穿红花棉袄的青年妇女，弯着腰，一股劲地薅着草皮。她是冷支书的爱人薛喜贞。
    冷云昌的船驶过湖心，敏捷地捞起一大把黑草，恰好青年社员柴东山的船迅疾地跟上来了。老冷向邻船的伙伴瞟了一眼，高兴地说：“东山！来，向岸上的穆桂英们示个威！”
    “好！”东山说着用高嗓子发出了悦耳的歌声：
    太阳一出满天红，
    打草船儿快如风，
    提醒岸上穆桂英，
    我们定要抢头名。
    “呵嗬呵嗬！呵嗬呵嗬！”冷云昌和打草的男社员们齐声助威。
    岸上的喜贞听了，忙和身边的几个女伴叽叽喳喳商量了一会，随即打起了清亮的山歌：
    锄头挥舞不停工，
    草皮堆起人多深，
    告诉湖里男子汉，
    咯场竞赛我们赢！
    “呵嗬呵嗬！呵嗬呵嗬！”喜贞周围的妇女也一齐助战。
    朝阳染红了白水湖，人们的头上冒着汗，歌声、笑声在湖边、湖面来回飘荡……
        食堂里
    吃午饭的钟声响了。上渡口生产队红旗食堂的社员们，说说笑笑走进了食堂，见桌子抹得干干净净，凳子摆得整整齐齐，每个桌上已经摆好了。这时一个戴口罩、系白围裙的中年人满脸挂笑，正端着一盘热腾腾的饭送到社员们的桌前。他是新来的炊事员、大队党总支副书记刘续波。
    六十多岁的老社员汤耀先一眼看见了刘支书，连忙劝阻：“支书，你的工作那样忙，咯点小事不要你操心罗！”
      “耀爹，群众的生活是件大事，忙也要管嘛！”刘续波笑着解释说。
    刘续波当炊事员的消息顿时传开了。七十多岁的王家翁妈边扒饭边说：“咯餐饭做得真好：有干有稀，稗子、糠壳淘得干净。还是搭帮我们的支书来挂帅！”社员张菊甫补充说：“菜也做得好：花色多，味口好。吃了咯样的菜，搞生产有的是劲！”
    “菊甫叔，以后还有咯样好的伙食吃吗？”小学生汤耀宜插嘴天真地问。
    “有！”刘续波送完了饭，挑一担开水来了。他兴致勃勃地说：“从今天起，全大队各级干部都到食堂轮流当炊事员，以后的伙食会越办越好！”
      堤边上
    傍晚，天边布满彩霞。长长的废堤两旁，嫩绿、茁壮的蚕豆、麦苗在夕阳的辉映和微风的抚弄下，显得格外娇艳。这时候，毛家园生产队第二作业组的堤边上，有几个社员赤着脚，正坐在麦子地里，热烈地谈论着今天的劳动收获。
      “今天一下午，我们五个人完成了四亩麦子、豌豆的薅草、追肥，大家干得蛮不错！”说这话的是一个又高又大的中年人，他是大队党总支书记冷诗群。
    “今年的冬杂粮三包包得合理，培育管理又搞得早，超产靠得稳！”老农冷应连高兴地说。
    冷诗群笑着点点头，换过话题说：“快收工了，我们抓紧评好工吧！今天应连爹负责泼粪，工效高，质量好，建议评高一点。”
    “还有，”一个名叫彭玉贞的妇女抢着说，“冷支书挑一下午的粪，做的重工夫，又冒歇气，更要评高一点！大家同意啵？”
    “同意！”社员们异口同声地赞成。接着一个个进行了民主评定：冷诗群五分，应连爹四分半，彭玉贞四分，其余两个妇女是三分半。都超过了劳动定额。
    评完工，冷诗群拍打掉手上的泥巴，从衣袋里掏出钢笔和劳动手册来，习惯地填上了自己的工分数字。这时社员们收拾工具，欢欢喜喜地回家去了。冷诗群挑着一担空粪桶，和应连爹并肩走在后面，他们在商量种小麦丰产土的事……
        晚　会
    晚上，上渡口食堂的文娱室里坐满了一屋子人，社员们正在煤油灯下欢乐地敲锣打鼓，弹琴吹唱。
    乐器组里，有个惹人注目的中年人：头扎白毛巾，身穿蓝衣服，身材魁梧，满脸挂笑，在熟练地敲着大锣。他就是公社党委副书记兼大队总支书冷国轩。
    冷国轩兴冲冲打完了“开台”锣，环视全场一遍，大声地笑着问：“社员们，大家看今晚唱么子戏呀？”
    “唱一出《金色的凤凰山》！”年青小伙子和姑娘们抢先出了题目。
    “不！要唱《生死牌》！”老倌子和老婆子们发表了不同意见。
    “好！都唱！不过，还是先唱一段自己编的吧。”说着，他向身边两个拉胡琴的社员?了?嘴，清亮的琴音立刻飘荡全室。紧接着，一对青年男女提高嗓门，用“西湖调”唱起来了：
    党的政策真英明，
    男女老少都欢迎。
    干部群众心连心，
    闹个生产满堂红……
    冷国轩在旁熟练地敲着竹板，一面指挥乐队，一面留心察看观众的情绪。社员们目不转睛地看着冷国轩和他带领的演员们。无数张黑里透红的笑脸，在通亮的煤油灯下放出了光彩。
      “白天搞生产，晚上有戏看，咯硬是劳逸结了合！”桂香爹敲着旱烟袋，回头对他的婆婆香翁妈说。
      “书记也参加演戏，咯样的事自古少有！”香翁妈瞟了她老倌一眼，高兴得不知说什么才好。
    “咚咚锵！锵咚锵！”台上的青年男女唱完了一段，锣鼓声、掌声、笑声一齐爆发，满屋子的人欢腾起来了……
