Working Steadily and Conscientiously, Maintaining a Hardworking and Simple Style:
Bai Fengtian Upholds the True Qualities of a Communist Party Member

    (Reported by this newspaper) Bai Fengtian, the Party Branch Secretary of Sugezhuang Brigade, Dazhao Commune, Leting County, Hebei Province, and a disabled veteran, has maintained the true qualities of a Communist Party member and adhered to the "Old Eighth Route Army" style for over a decade. Under his leadership, the brigade has achieved increased production year after year, overfulfilling the state's grain procurement tasks annually, and maintaining grain reserves every year.

    Bai Fengtian's steady and hard-working style has not only greatly inspired the commune members but also influenced and motivated the cadres. He often says to everyone, "Our country has a poor foundation. To build socialism, we must rely on our own hands." There are six cadres in this brigade, and under his influence, they all record work points based on their labor, and the number of workdays they contribute each year is about the same as that of ordinary able-bodied laborers. Bai Fengtian not only takes the lead in working hard but also pays special attention to leveraging the wisdom of the masses. He learns when he doesn't know and asks when he doesn't understand, listening to and adopting the opinions of the masses at all times.

    Bai Fengtian has taken root among the masses, and the broad masses of commune members also love their secretary. When Bai Fengtian is mentioned, the commune members say that our secretary has the style of the Old Eighth Route Army. Bai Fengtian has always been a model of hard work and simplicity in his life. For fourteen years, what he eats, wears, and uses is exactly the same as an ordinary farmer, without any special privileges, and he never wastes a single penny. He receives some pension money every year, but he always tries to save it and use the money for production. This spring, he took out all of his pension money of more than one hundred yuan that he had saved up over time to support the brigade's agricultural technology transformation. Bai Fengtian is very strict with himself, but he is considerate to the masses. In order to run the canteens well, Bai Fengtian personally engaged in "experimental fields" for the canteens, making the canteens in the entire brigade better and better, and powerfully promoting production. Bai Fengtian frequently visits and understands the living conditions of the commune members, and from time to time goes to the homes for the elderly and kindergartens to inquire about their well-being. When there is refined grain or delicious food, he always arranges to send it to the homes for the elderly first, so that those old people who suffered in the old society can live a happy life in their later years.

    In recent years, under the correct leadership of the Party committee, and thanks to the hard work of Bai Fengtian and the broad masses, the production of Sugezhuang Brigade has undergone major changes, the living standards of the commune members have been continuously improved, and their enthusiasm has become increasingly high. The brigade has been rated as a model brigade in the county.

    工作踏踏实实　作风艰苦朴素
    白凤田保持共产党员本色
    本报讯　河北省乐亭县大钊公社苏各庄大队党总支书记、残废复员军人白凤田，十几年来一直保持共产党员的本色，坚持“老八路”作风。他领导的大队连年增产，年年超额完成国家征购任务，年年有粮食储备。
    白凤田踏踏实实、苦干实干的作风，不仅大大鼓舞了社员，也影响和带动了干部。他经常向大家说：“咱们的国家底子穷，要建设社会主义，就得凭咱们的双手”。这个大队共六个干部，在他的影响下，都是凭劳动记工，他们每年作的劳动日都跟一般壮劳动力差不多。白凤田不仅带头苦干，还特别注意发挥群众的智慧。不会就学，不懂就问，他随时随地听取和采纳群众的意见。
    白凤田在群众中扎了根，广大社员也都热爱自己的书记。一提起白凤田，社员们就说，我们的书记是老八路作风。白凤田生活上也一直是艰苦朴素的表率。十四年来，他吃的、穿的、用的完全和一个普通农民一样，没有半点特殊，从不浪费一个钱。他每年都有一些抚恤金，但他总是想法节省下来，把钱用到生产上去。今年春天，他就把平日节省下来的一百多元抚恤金，全部拿出来支援了队里的农业技术改造。白凤田对自己很刻苦，但对群众却体贴入微。为了把食堂办好，白凤田亲自搞了食堂“试验田”，使全大队的食堂越办越好，有力地推动了生产。白凤田经常访问、了解社员们的生活情况，并且不时地到敬老院幼儿园等地去问寒问暖，有了细粮或好吃的食品，他总张罗着先送给敬老院，让那些在旧社会里受尽了苦的老人，幸福地度过晚年生活。
    几年来，在党委的正确领导下，由于白凤田和广大群众一起艰苦奋斗，苏各庄大队的生产已经发生了重大的变化，社员的生活水平不断提高，干劲越来越足，被评为全县的标兵大队。
