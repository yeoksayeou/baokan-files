    Organizing Family Visit Groups to Help Workers Arrange Their Lives
    Thousands of Department Cadres and Communist Party Members of Dalian Shipyard Go Deep into Workers' Residential Areas to Show Concern and Ask About Their Well-being

    (Our report) According to the Lüda Daily News: The Dalian Shipyard Party Committee, led by the Party Secretary, Factory Director, and Chairman of the Trade Union, organized a thousand-person worker family visit group to visit workers' families. Participating in this visit were 979 leading cadres from workshops and departments, as well as 2,951 key Party members. The visit group was divided into 21 sub-groups and 839 groups according to workshops, departments, work sections, and teams. Starting from November 7th, they used their spare time to go deep into canteens, dormitories, and workers' homes for visits. In just half a month, they systematically visited 6,189 worker families, specifically helping workers to comprehensively arrange their lives. They were warmly welcomed by the majority of workers and their families, and powerfully promoted the in-depth development of the increased production and economy practice movement.

    During the visits, the visit groups used forms such as symposiums, report meetings, and performances to thoroughly publicize the current excellent domestic and international situation to the broad masses of workers and their families. They publicized the Party's policies and the great significance of running a household diligently and thriftily and arranging life well. They also gained an in-depth understanding of the masses' clothing, food, housing and other aspects, and widely introduced advanced experiences in arranging life well, such as managing the household diligently and thriftily, planning grain use, managing household affairs well, and educating children well. They mobilized more than 50 skilled housekeepers to form an advanced experience promotion team for arranging life well, and adopted methods such as personal experiences, physical demonstrations, and pictorial explanations to deliver the experience to the door, promoting more than 40 kinds of experiences successively. For families that were truly in difficulty, a combination of mutual assistance and focused care was adopted to help them arrange their lives well.

    After the visit groups carried out extensive work, the broad masses of workers and their families further felt the Party's meticulous care for their lives. As a result, a new atmosphere of mutual comparison, mutual learning, and mutual assistance in arranging life well has emerged in workers' families. After Party Secretary Yuan Xianqian came to the home of veteran worker Liu Yinglong, he asked Liu Yinglong: "How are the preparations for the winter? Is the kang (heated brick bed) easy to heat?" The old worker grabbed the Party Secretary's hand with emotion and said: "Secretary, don't worry. The coal briquettes have also been made, and there are salted, fresh, and dried vegetables, enough for the winter. I don't lack anything to wear or eat. If it weren't for the Party and Chairman Mao leading us to turn over, how could I live such a good life." When Deputy Party Secretaries Sun Wenxue and Yu Houfu visited the family of worker Wang Zhenduo, Wang Zhenduo's old mother said with emotion: "The Party cares about us too much. Leading comrades are so busy and still come to help us arrange our lives. I guarantee to the leaders that I will definitely arrange my life well and let the leaders rest assured." Among the workers' families, a competition climax of red, diligent, skillful, and thrifty, centered on arranging life well, has been set off. The workers' families have written letters of determination to guarantee to the Party that they have the determination and confidence to arrange their lives well, further develop the working class's fine tradition of hard work, thrift, and economy, plan their lives, manage their household affairs well, and enable their loved ones to win more battles in production without any worries. The workers also wrote big-character posters stating: They will contribute all their strength to production in the factory, and become experts in arranging their lives at home, so as to better complete the production tasks and repay the Party's kindness. After Party Secretary Yuan Xianqian visited the workers of the steel casting workshop, the enthusiasm of the steelmakers was even greater, and the steel output rose steadily.

    组织家庭访问团帮助职工安排生活
    大连造船厂数千名科室干部和共产党员深入工人住宅区问寒问暖
    本报讯　据旅大日报消息：大连造船厂党委以党委书记、厂长、工会主席为主，组织了千人职工家庭访问团，对职工家属进行访问。参加这次访问的有车间、科室领导干部九百七十九人，此外还有党员骨干两千九百五十一人。访问团按各车间、科室、工段、小组划分为二十一个分团和八百三十九个小组，从11月7日起，利用业余时间，分头深入到食堂、宿舍和职工家庭进行访问。仅半个月的时间，他们就有计划地走访了六千一百八十九户职工家庭，具体帮助职工全面安排了生活，受到广大职工和工人家属的热烈欢迎，有力地推动了增产节约运动的深入开展。
    访问团在分头进行访问当中，运用座谈会、报告会和演唱等形式，深入地向广大职工和职工家属宣传了目前国内外的大好形势，宣传了党的政策和勤俭持家、安排好生活的重大意义，还深入地了解群众的衣、食、住等方面情况，广泛地向群众介绍勤俭持家、计划用粮、管好家务、教好子女等安排好生活的先进经验。他们发动五十多名勤俭持家的能手，组成安排好生活先进经验推广团，采取现身说法、实物表演和图片说明等办法，将经验送上门，先后共推广了四十多种经验。对确实有困难的家庭，采取互助与重点照顾相结合的办法，帮助安排好生活。
    访问团广泛开展工作以后，广大职工和工属进一步地感到了党对他们的生活无微不至的关怀，因而在职工家庭中，出现了一片互比互学互相帮助安排好生活的新气象。党委书记原宪千同志来到老工人刘应隆的家里后，问刘应隆：“过冬用的东西准备得怎样？炕好不好烧？”老工人感动地拉着党委书记的手说：“书记你放心吧。煤坯也做好了，菜有咸的，也有鲜的，还有干的，足够一冬用的、吃的、穿的都不缺。要不是党和毛主席领导咱们翻了身，我哪能过上这样好日子。”党委副书记孙文学、于厚福同志访问工人王振铎的家庭时，王振铎的老母亲感动地说：“党太关心我们了，领导同志这样忙还来帮助我们安排生活。我向领导保证一定要把生活安排得好好的，让领导同志放心。”工人家属中间已经掀起了一个以安排好生活为中心的红、勤、巧、俭的竞赛高潮，工人家属们纷纷写决心书向党保证：有决心和信心安排好生活，进一步发挥工人阶级艰苦勤俭节约的优良传统，做到生活有计划，管好家务，使亲人在生产上无牵无挂地多打胜仗。工人们也写大字报表示：在厂为生产贡献出一切力量，在家成为安排好生活的能手，以更好地完成生产任务来报答党的恩情。党委书记原宪千同志访问铸钢车间工人以后，炼钢工人的劲头更大，钢产量节节上升。
