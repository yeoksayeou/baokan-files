Xinhua News Agency, Karamay, December 15th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Lü Hongxiang): The Karamay Oil Mine cadres are going deep into the front line of production. The situation is described as follows: Now, Karamay is a world of frozen ice. All levels of cadres in the oil mine, braving the severe cold of minus twenty degrees, have recently carried their bedding to the well side to set up tents and settle down, eating, sleeping, and working with the workers at the well side. Some wells, forced by the severe cold to stop producing oil, are now flowing with crude oil; many low-yield wells have created new records. The daily crude oil production level for the first five days of December for the entire mine increased by 3.3% compared to late November.

At the "experimental well" of Wang Zhaoming, the Party Secretary of the Second Oil Extraction Brigade, Wang Zhaoming and cadres and workers can be seen every day observing the oil well and studying oil extraction operations. In the production area of this brigade, due to the sharp drop in temperature in recent days, the temperature of the crude oil insulation furnace is insufficient, which easily leads to wax formation, threatening crude oil production. Wang Zhaoming walked through the wells during the day, observing and visiting, and at night, around the lamp in the dugout, he studied and analyzed the structure of the insulation furnace with the workers. They decided to expand the furnace chamber and raise the chimney. Wang Zhaoming and the workers worked together to dig soil and move bricks to rebuild the insulation furnace. After the reconstruction, the temperature increased twice as much as before. Then, the experience of the "Secretary's Furnace" was widely promoted throughout the brigade, and at the same time, a mass movement of "Three Hundred Full of Red" (100% of the furnaces are ignited, 100% of the furnaces are burned to 100 degrees, and 100% of the furnaces are used for 100 days) was launched. They finally overcame the severe cold, overfulfilled the state plan ahead of schedule in November, and since December, the daily crude oil production level has increased by more than 10% compared to before.

At night, at the construction site of the Third Oil Extraction Brigade in the southeastern part of the oil field, cadres such as the Party Secretary of the Brigade and the workers are patrolling nervously with pipe wrenches in their hands. Although white frost flowers are forming on people's eyebrows and hat brims, no coldness can be seen on their faces. Xu Tianming, the Party Branch Secretary of the Seventh Team, was just transferred to this "backward" team more than two months ago. He found that the output of the night shift was always lower than that of the day shift, and some people said that this was the "rule." But Xu Tianming was determined to work on the shift and "get to the bottom of it." From then on, he kept his materials with him and his notebook in his hand, working, watching, and asking, recording the changes in each well and the various different opinions of his partners. Whenever he had time, he would study with the workers and finally found the cause of poor furnace maintenance. In response to the loopholes in the operating system, he formulated the "Eight-Character Method" for night shift work and tested it at Station 14. As a result, the "mystery" of low night shift production was revealed. In November, twenty-seven of the thirty night shifts in the entire team had a higher or equal output than the day shifts.

On the oil fields operating in the open air, the destructive power of wind to winter production is no less than that of severe cold. On November 19, a rare ninth-level storm in recent years struck. The oil extraction area was suddenly dark, and the wind rolled up sand and rocks, rolling all over the ground. Giant oil tankers with a load of seven tons were also forced to stop on the roadside, not daring to move. In order to "fight the storm for oil," Zhang Dong, the captain of the Second Brigade, arranged for the workers to take shelter from the wind in the house, but he drilled out of the dugout and checked the oil wells again and again in the gale. In this way, they withstood the storm and protected the crude oil production of the entire team.

    干部深入现场积极采取保温措施
    克拉玛依原油增产
    据新华社克拉玛依15日电　新华社记者吕鸿祥报道：克拉玛依油矿干部深入生产第一线的情景说：现在，克拉玛依已是千里冰封的世界。油矿各级干部，冒着零下二十度严寒，最近纷纷背了铺盖到井边搭篷落户，同工人一起吃在井边、睡在井边、劳动在井边。有些被严寒所迫而不出油的井，流出了原油；许多低产井创造了新纪录。全矿12月份前五天的原油日产水平比11月下旬提高了3.3％。
    在采油二大队党委书记王照明的“试验井”边，每天都可以看到王照明和干部、工人们一起，观察油井，研究采油操作。这个大队的生产地区，连日因气温急剧下降，原油保温炉温度不够，容易结腊，威胁着原油生产。王照明白天走遍各井，观察，访问，夜里围在地窝子里的灯下，和工人研究分析保温炉结构，他们决定把炉腔扩大，烟囱加高。王照明和工人们一道挖土、搬砖，改建保温炉。改建后，温度比原来提高两倍。接着，全大队普遍推广“书记炉”的经验，同时展开“三百满堂红”（百分之百的炉点火，百分之百的炉烧到一百度，百分之百的炉使用一百天）的群众运动。他们终于战胜了严寒，11月份提前超额完成国家计划，12月以来，原油日产水平又比以前提高了10％以上。
    夜里，在油田东南部第三采油大队工地，大队党委书记等干部和工人们手提管钳，紧张地在巡逻。尽管人们的眉毛上、帽沿上结下白白的霜花，但在他们的脸上看不到丝毫寒意。七队党支部书记徐天明，两个多月以前刚调到这个“后进”队来。他发现夜班产量老是比白班低，有人说这是“规律”。但徐天明决心跟班劳动，“打破砂锅问到底”。从此他资料不离身，本子不离手，边劳动，边看，边问，把每口井的变化情况和伙伴们各种不同的看法都记下来，一有空就和工人一起研究，终于找到了炉子护理不善的原因。他针对操作制度上的漏洞，制定出夜班工作“八字法”，并在十四号站试验。结果，夜班低产的“谜”揭开了。全队11月份三十个夜班，有二十七个夜班的产量高于或等于白班。
    在露天作业的油田上，风对冬季生产的破坏性并不亚于严寒。11月19日，近年来稀见的九级风暴袭来了。采油区顿时天昏地暗，风卷起砂石满地翻滚着，载重七吨的巨型油罐车也被迫停在路旁不敢动一动。为了“向风暴争油”，二大队队长张栋把工人安排在屋里避风，自己却钻出地窝子，在狂风中把油井检查一遍又一遍。就这样，抗住了风暴，保住了全队的原油产量。
