Develop Sideline Occupations, Promote Agriculture
Shikuo Commune Universally Applies High-Quality Fertilizer to Wheat Fields, All Farm Tools, Large and Small, are Repaired Promptly

(Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 26th) The Weijia Cliff Management District (basic accounting unit) of the Shikuo People's Commune in Lüliang County, Shanxi Province, has achieved remarkable results in developing sideline production. By the end of November, the income from sideline production in this management district totaled more than 19,600 yuan, an increase of 49.6% over the same period last year, averaging 80 yuan per household and 25 yuan per person. At the same time, the development of sideline production has provided a large amount of funds for the sustained leap forward in agricultural production, vigorously supporting agricultural production. During the autumn wheat planting, the entire district withdrew a batch of cash from sideline income to buy back 30,000 jin of chemical fertilizer, so that 1,846 mu of wheat were fertilized with an average of 16 jin of chemical fertilizer per mu, solving the problem of insufficient fertilizer and ensuring timely wheat sowing. The production teams promptly repaired 320 damaged farm tools such as drags and plows because of sufficient funds. The collection of various mountain fruits, mountain teas, and hunted mountain birds and beasts not only improved the lives of commune members but also saved expenses. All six public canteens in the district achieved self-sufficiency in charcoal for the whole year.

According to the characteristics of many sideline production items, wide avenues, scalable sizes, and different seasonality in the local area, the Party branch of the management district specifically planned the business scope of the management district, production teams, and individual commune members. Mining coal, firing stoneware, weaving reed mats, and cutting mountain goods, which are technically and commercially strong and inconvenient for decentralized operation, are all managed by the management district. The collection of wild plants, the elimination of mountain pests, weaving, and canteen pig raising and vegetable planting, which are closely related to the lives of the masses, are contracted to production teams. Small-scale sideline production such as weaving and vinegar brewing is left to individual commune members. For the production projects contracted to the production teams, all of them implemented quota management and a system of contracting for work, output, specifications, and quantity, with rewards for overproduction. It was also stipulated that 70% of the income from the production team's over-fulfillment of sideline production tasks should go to the production team, and 30% should be turned over to the management district. The production teams implemented a remuneration method combining piecework and cash subsidies for the production projects operated by commune members. In addition to recording work points according to the completion of quotas, commune members would receive a cash subsidy of 0.3 yuan for each quota completed. In this way, the leaders of the management district could concentrate their energy, the production teams could arrange tasks more flexibly, and the commune members' enthusiasm for sideline production was even greater.

After comprehensively planning and uniformly arranging the business scope, the Weijia Cliff Management District Party Branch, on the premise of ensuring agricultural production, made reasonable arrangements for the labor force in sideline production in three different situations: during the peak season of sideline production after the autumn harvest and before the spring sowing, the labor force invested accounted for 30%; during the small peak season of sideline production after the spring sowing and before the summer harvest, and after the summer harvest and before the autumn harvest, general small-scale operations and shutdowns were implemented, maintaining 8% of the labor force to ensure key production; during the busy agricultural seasons such as spring sowing, summer harvest, and autumn harvest, efforts were concentrated to strengthen the agricultural production front, reducing the sideline production labor force to less than 3%, achieving greater activity during peak seasons and activity during off-seasons.

The Party Branch of this management district, under the principle of not hindering collective production, specifically arranged the time for commune members to engage in household sideline occupations, implementing two days off per month during busy agricultural seasons and five days off per month during slack seasons. After entering winter, they also insisted on collective production in the morning and allowed commune members to engage in various indoor productions such as basket weaving, animal-carrying basket weaving, hamper weaving, straw hat weaving, wild plant processing, and starch making in the afternoon. After such arrangements, it not only promoted the development of collective sideline production but also greatly mobilized the enthusiasm of commune members to engage in individual sideline production.

In order to strengthen the leadership of sideline production, the Management District Party Branch adhered to the system of conducting inspections every half month, and monthly and quarterly evaluations and summaries, promptly studying and solving problems in production, promoting advanced experiences, setting up pacesetters, planting red flags, and helping production teams open up sideline avenues, purchase utensils, sell products, and impart technology, ensuring the smooth development of sideline production.

    发展副业　促进农业
    石口公社麦田普施优质肥，大小农具做到及时修补
    本报太原26日电　山西省吕梁县石口人民公社卫家崖管理区（基本核算单位）在发展副业生产中取得显著成绩。到11月底，今年这个管理区副业生产收入共一万九千六百多元，比去年同时增加49.6％，每户平均八十元，每人平均二十五元。同时副业生产的发展，为农业生产的持续跃进提供了大量的资金，有力地支援了农业生产。秋季小麦播种中，全区从副业收入中抽出了一批现金买回三万斤化学肥料，使一千八百四十六亩小麦，每亩平均施化肥十六斤，解决了肥料不足的问题，保证了小麦适时下种。各生产队对损坏的耱、犁等三百二十件农具，因为资金充足，都及时进行了修补。采集的各种山果、山茶和猎获的山禽野兽，既改善了社员生活，又节省了开支，全区六个公共食堂全年的烧炭全部做到了自给。
    管理区党支部根据当地副业生产宗项多、门路广、规模可大可小和季节性不同等特点，具体规划了管理区、生产小队、社员个人的经营范围。技术性和商品性强，不便分散经营的挖煤炭、烧砂器、编苇席、砍山货等都归管理区经营；资源广阔，不便集中经营的采集野生植物、打山害、编制和与群众生活密切相关的食堂养猪、种菜等项生产，包给生产小队经营；编织、熬醋等零星副业生产让社员个人经营。对包给生产小队经营的生产项目，样样都实行了定额管理和包工、包产、包规格、包数量和超产奖励制度，并规定生产小队超额完成副业生产任务的收入，70％归生产小队，30％上交管理区。生产小队对社员经营的生产项目实行了按件计工和现金补助相结合的计酬办法，社员除按完成定额记劳动日外，每完成一个定额要补助现款三角。这样一来，使管理区领导精力集中，生产小队安排活计更加灵活，社员对经营副业生产的积极性也更大了。
    在全面规划，统一安排了经营范围之后，卫家崖管理区党支部在保证农业生产的前提下，把副业生产的劳动力分三种情况作了合理安排：在秋收后和春播前副业生产的旺季，投放的劳力占到30％；在春播后和夏收前、夏收后和秋收前副业生产的小旺季，实行一般的小办和停办，保持8％的劳力保证重点生产；在春播、夏收、秋收等农忙季节，就集中力量加强农业生产战线，把副业生产的劳力压缩到3％以下，做到了旺季更旺，淡中有旺。
    这个管理区的党支部，在不妨碍集体生产的原则下，具体安排了社员经营家庭副业的时间，实行农忙季节每月放假两天，农闲每月放假五天。入冬以后，又坚持了上午集体生产，下午让社员个人进行编篮子、编笼驮、编筐、编草帽、野生植物加工、制淀粉等多种室内生产。这样安排之后，既推动了集体副业生产的发展，又大大调动了社员个人经营副业生产的积极性。
    为了加强对副业生产的领导，管理区党支部坚持执行了每半月一检查，逐月逐季评比总结制度，及时研究解决生产中的问题，推广先进经验，树标兵、插红旗，并帮助生产小队开辟副业门路、购置用具、推销产品、传授技术，保证了副业生产的顺利发展。
