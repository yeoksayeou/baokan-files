    The Three Types of Canteens Have Been Upgraded
    ——An Account of Dou Xuefeng, Deputy Secretary of the Party Branch of Zhongxi Production Team, Running the Canteen Well
    Baodi County Party Committee Correspondents Group, Hebei Daily Reporter
    Dou Xuefeng was originally the director of the Women's Federation of Zhongtianying Management Area of Dakoutun Commune in Baodi County, Hebei, and a member of the Commune Party Committee. In September of this year, she was sent down to the Zhongxi Production Team as the deputy secretary of the Party branch. When she was about to go to the Zhongxi Production Team, the secretaries of the commune and the management area told her: "Zhongxi is a backward team in production, and the canteen is also a third-class canteen. Changing the face of the third-class canteen is the key to changing the face of production. You should rely on the branch and the masses to run the canteen well first." She kept these words firmly in mind, and after going down, she devoted herself to running the canteen well, personally serving as the canteen administrator, listening to the Party and the masses in everything, and deeply implementing the Party's policies. Before long, the canteen improved greatly, and the production outlook of the whole team also changed. A few days ago, the commune conducted a production competition, and the Zhongxi Production Team surpassed the Hongqi Team, Juanzi Production Team of Xinkaikou Management Area, for the first time with the best results.
    
    Deeply Understand the Requirements of the Masses
    
    There are five production teams in Zhongxi Village. Before September, there were only three canteens, the largest one serving more than 100 households, nearly 600 people. The villagers lived relatively scattered, and the large canteen made it inconvenient to come and go, delaying production. Dou Xuefeng reflected the opinion of running canteens by team at the branch meeting, and at the same time conducted a more in-depth investigation among the masses.
    
    Xuefeng went to the Third Canteen to cook with the cooks. The cooks in this canteen and the villagers who ate in this canteen also believed that it would be more convenient to appropriately reduce the scope of the canteen. The team cadres also said: Establishing canteens by team is not only convenient for the villagers, but also beneficial to production, and has many advantages for doing a good job in the canteen's financial resources and implementing the policy of overproduction rewards. Xuefeng reported these situations to the branch and introduced the benefits of running canteens by team. After discussion, the branch committee members agreed with this opinion. The branch then put this matter forward to discuss with the team cadres and villagers, who all agreed to do so. And discussed and determined several methods for running canteens by team.
    
    Everyone Manages Everyone's Life
    
    After the canteen started cooking within the scope of the team, Dou Xuefeng, with the approval of the branch, went to the canteen of the Third Team as an administrator and moved to live in the canteen.
    
    After arriving at the canteen, she found that a big problem was that the policy of planned grain use, saving grain use, fixed quotas per person, eating with tickets, and saving for oneself was not deeply and thoroughly implemented. Although the canteen also had a grain use plan and consumption indicators, it was only controlled by the team cadres and canteen management personnel, and the villagers did not know their personal quotas. Xuefeng asked the team cadres and canteen administrators about this matter. They said that they were afraid that the masses would not be able to control themselves well, which would easily lead to waste and affect the saving of grain. Xuefeng gave them a patient explanation and told them that if they wanted to live a good life, they could only rely on and mobilize the masses. After discussing with the team cadres, a villager meeting was held to hand over the team's grain resources to the masses, organize the masses to discuss, and formulate an annual and phased grain use plan. And grain coupons were issued to the villagers according to the quota, and the method of saving for oneself was clarified. The villagers were very satisfied and said, "Everyone manages everyone's life, and we are guaranteed to live a better life."
    
    The masses have been mobilized, and the current responsibility of the cadres is how to rely on the masses to run the canteen well. Xuefeng first focused her attention on studying the problem of eating sweet potatoes well. This year, the team harvested a lot of sweet potatoes. In the past, the masses were accustomed to eating them boiled, but this way of eating was often unpopular. The branch decided to promote the experience of making starch from fresh sweet potatoes. Making starch from fresh sweet potatoes requires water mills and animal power. The Zhongxi Production Team only had two water mills, and at that time, the farm work was busy, so livestock could not be spared. In order to break through the key to eating sweet potatoes well, Xuefeng ran home and studied and made it with her father, using nails to make holes in a piece of iron, making a grater to grate sweet potatoes, and quickly made starch. However, the starch output was small, so Xuefeng consulted with the villagers again. The villagers said that the problem was that the grating was too coarse. If the nail holes were smaller, and the sweet potatoes were grated into powder, the starch output would definitely increase. She tried again according to the opinions of the villagers, and the effect was good. Party Branch Secretary Li Yongsheng and Deputy Secretary Li Dehai worked with her to make sixteen manual sweet potato graters. The next day, they were put into production, setting off a mass activity of making starch from fresh sweet potatoes. Making sweet potatoes into starch can make a variety of foods, and the villagers are very satisfied.
    
    Must Make the Masses Satisfied
    
    From this incident, Xuefeng learned a truth: the food is made for the masses to eat, and the satisfaction of the masses is the standard for running the canteen well; and only by relying on the masses can the canteen be truly run well. From then on, Xuefeng sought the opinions of the villagers more deeply and carefully. Some villagers said: "In the past, the cooks made whatever the villagers ate. In the future, can't the cooks make whatever the villagers want to eat?" Xuefeng felt that this should be done, and it was mostly possible. On the one hand, according to the methods proposed by the masses, the canteen made more than a dozen kinds of staple and non-staple foods such as lazy tofu and layered cake, and formulated a meal list to match them into sets; on the other hand, she studied cooking methods with the cooks, how to eat economically and well, and also pay attention to nutrition. She remembered an old saying: "Drink soup before eating, and you won't get hurt when you're old." So she discussed with the cooks to ensure that every meal had both dry and liquid food, and developed more than a dozen kinds of soup, which were often changed. Villager Li Desong said: "There is soup every meal, and I eat my fill and feel comfortable. My stomach problems no longer occur."
    
    Help People Who Don't Know How to Manage Their Lives
    
    The canteen was run well, changed from the third category to the first category, and the villagers ate economically and well. More than 80% of the households had grain reserves. The old villager Wu Changshan was so happy that he sent a letter to his daughter, saying that the canteen had changed its appearance and asked his daughter to come back to her mother's house to take a look. Hao Fuyuan's old lady pointed to the grain she had saved and said to Xuefeng: "Our village's canteen is well run, and the villagers all praise you as a good secretary!"
    
    One evening, Yang's old lady told Xuefeng that her granddaughter-in-law Wang Guifen didn't know how to manage her life, and she didn't care about the next meal after eating this meal. At this time, Xuefeng remembered the words of the secretary of the management area party general branch: "Managing life must not be satisfied with the majority. Even if 99% of the people are satisfied, if there is a problem with one person's life, it must be seriously solved." She hurried to visit several households with problems, and reported the situation to the branch in the evening. After research, the Party branch decided to do the work of the "one percent" of the people. At the branch meeting, the situation of the whole village was analyzed and ranked household by household, and the party members and cadres were assigned to contract with each household. Xuefeng contracted with two households, including Wang Guifen, who didn't know how to manage her life. She went to Wang Guifen's house, patiently told her a lot of truths, and helped her formulate a plan for saving grain. Wang Guifen felt that Xuefeng's words were all reasonable, and she was very moved to see that she cared about herself so much, so she lived frugally from then on.
    
    Everything Has a "Bottom"
    
    Xuefeng is also good at discovering problems from small things. One day, Xuefeng found wisps of smoke rising from the ash heap. She thought, "What's going on?" She quickly squatted beside the stove to make a fire, and while burning, she watched. It turned out that the firewood was not burned thoroughly. She calculated: if it burns like this, it will burn a hundred bundles of corn stalks a day. Will there be difficulties in burning firewood in the future? Old poor peasant villager Guan Changyou also said to Xuefeng: "Grain, firewood, and vegetables cannot be missing, and you must have a bottom in your heart when you live a big life!" Xuefeng thought after hearing these words: "Firewood, vegetables, and grain must also be calculated." So Xuefeng organized each team and each canteen to clear the bottom and settle accounts, changed the old-style stove to a plum blossom stove and a suction stove, and also educated the cooks to save firewood. In this way, the firewood burned in the third team's canteen was reduced by half compared to the original. Each team also made a plan to burn broken firewood first and then whole firewood, what kind of firewood to use for burning a big fire, and what kind of firewood to use for burning a small fire.
    
    Dou Xuefeng found out the family background, weighed the pole every day, cleared the bottom of grain, firewood, and vegetables once a month, had a plan every day, and had a surplus every month, and the canteen was run better and better.

    三类食堂升级了
    ——记种西生产队党支部副书记窦学凤办好食堂的事迹
    宝坻县委通讯组  河北日报记者
    窦学凤，原是河北宝坻县大口屯公社种田营管理区的妇联主任，公社党委会委员。今年9月下放到种西生产队当支部副书记。临到种西生产队的时候，公社和管理区书记对她说：“种西是生产上的落后队，食堂也是三类食堂。改变三类食堂的面貌，是改变生产面貌的关键。你应当依靠支部和群众，首先把食堂搞好。”她牢牢记住这些话，下去以后就一心办好食堂，亲自当食堂管理员，事事听党的话，听群众的话，深入地贯彻执行党的政策。时间不长，食堂大有起色，全队的生产面貌也改观了。前些天，公社进行生产评比，种西生产队第一次以最好的成绩赶过了辛开口管理区的红旗队卷子生产队。
    深入群众了解要求
    种西村共有五个生产小队，9月份以前只办着三个食堂，最大的一个一百多户，将近六百口人吃饭。社员居住比较分散，食堂大了来去耽误生产，也很不方便。窦学凤一面在支部会上反映以小队为单位办食堂的意见，一面到群众中进行更深入的调查工作。
    学凤到第三食堂同炊事员一起去做饭。这个食堂的炊事员们和在这个食堂吃饭的社员也认为食堂范围适当缩小比较方便。小队干部们也说：以小队为单位建立食堂，既方便社员，又有利生产，对搞好食堂家底、执行超产奖励等政策好处很多。学凤向支部汇报了这些情况，介绍了按小队办食堂的好处，经过讨论，支部委员都同意这个意见。支部又把这事提出来和小队干部、社员商量，都同意这样做。并且讨论确定了小队办食堂的几项办法。
    大家的生活大家管
    食堂按小队范围开伙以后，窦学凤经过支部批准，到第三小队食堂当管理员，并搬到食堂里去住。
    到食堂以后，她发现一个很大的问题是计划用粮、节约用粮、以人定量、凭票吃饭、节约归己的政策贯彻得不深不透。虽然食堂也有用粮计划，也订了消费指标，只是由小队干部和食堂管理人员掌握着，社员不知道个人的定量。学凤为这事曾问过小队干部和食堂管理员。他们说是怕群众自己掌握不好，容易浪费，影响节约用粮。学凤向他们做了耐心的解释，告诉他们要想过好日子，只有依靠和发动群众才行。经过和小队干部商量，召开了社员大会，把小队的粮食家底交给群众，组织群众讨论，制订了全年和分段用粮计划。并且按照定量发给社员粮票，明确了节约归己的办法。社员们非常满意，都说：“大家的生活大家管，保准日子过得更好”。
    群众发动起来了，当前干部的责任是如何依靠群众把食堂办好。学凤把注意力首先集中在研究吃好甘薯的问题上。今年这个队收获甘薯很多，群众过去习惯是煮着吃，这种吃法常吃就不受欢迎。支部决定推广鲜薯制淀粉的经验。鲜薯制淀粉，需要水磨和畜力。种西生产队只有两盘水磨，当时农活又忙，抽不出牲口来。学凤为了突破吃好甘薯这个关键，跑到家里和父亲边研究边做，把一块铁片用钉子钉了眼，做成擦子，用来擦甘薯，很快就搞出了淀粉。但是淀粉出得少，学凤又找社员商量。社员们说毛病是擦的粗，钉眼再小点，把甘薯擦成粉末，出淀粉量一定会增加。她按照社员的意见再次试验，效果良好。党支部书记李永圣、副支书李德海同她一齐动手，制成了十六把人工擦薯器。第二天就投入了生产，掀起群众性的用鲜薯制淀粉的活动。把甘薯做成淀粉，能做多种食品，社员非常满意。
    一定让群众满意
    从这件事，学凤摸出了一条道理：饭是做给群众吃的，群众满意是搞好食堂的标准；也只有依靠群众，才能真正办好食堂。从此，学凤更深入细致地征求社员的意见。有的社员说：“过去是炊事员做啥社员吃啥，以后是不是也可以按照社员想吃啥炊事员就做啥呢？”学凤觉得这是应该做到，也多半是可能做到的事情。她一面根据群众提出的办法，食堂做出了懒豆腐、千层糕等十几种主副食，并且订出饭单，搭配成套；一面和炊事员研究做饭方法，怎样才能做到吃省吃好，还讲究营养。她想起了一句老话：“吃饭先喝汤，老来无有伤。”就和炊事员商量，做到每顿饭都有干有稀，并研究出十多种汤，经常变样。社员李德松说：“顿顿有汤，吃得又饱又舒服，我的胃病不再犯啦。”
    帮助不会过日子的人
    食堂办好了，由三类变成了一类，社员们吃得又省又好，80％多的户有了储备粮。喜得老社员吴长山给闺女捎信，说食堂变了样，叫闺女回娘家来看看。郝福元家老太太指着自己节省下来的粮食，对学凤说：“咱村的食堂可办好了，社员们都夸你是个好支书呢！”
    一天傍黑，杨老太太告诉学凤：她的孙媳王桂芬不会过日子，吃上顿不顾下顿。这时，学凤想起了管理区党总支书记的话：“管生活绝不能满足于大多数，即使99％的人满意了，有一个人的生活有问题，也要认真解决。”她赶忙到几个有问题的户去访问，晚上把情况向支部作了汇报。党支部经过研究，决定要做好“百分之一”的人的工作。支部会上把全村的情况逐户进行了分析排队，由党员干部分包各户。学凤包了两户，其中有不会过日子的王桂芬。她到王桂芬家里，耐心地讲了很多道理，还帮助她订了节约用粮的计划。王桂芬听学凤的话句句在理，又见她对自己这么关心，很受感动，从此精打细算过日子。
    件件事情都有“底”
    学凤还善于从细小的事情上发现问题。一天，学凤发现灰堆里冒出缕缕细烟，她想：“怎么回事？”她赶快蹲在灶旁烧火，边烧边看，原来是柴火没有烧透。她算了算：照这样烧法，一天要烧一百捆玉米秸，今后烧柴岂不发生困难？老贫农社员关长友也对学凤说：“粮柴菜缺一样也不行，过大日子可得心里有底啊！”学凤听了这话，心想：“柴禾、菜和粮食一样，也得算了烧。”于是学凤组织各小队各食堂清底算账，把旧式灶改为梅花灶、吸风灶，还向炊事员进行节约烧柴的教育。这样，三小队食堂烧柴比原来节省了一半多。各小队还做出先烧碎柴后烧整柴、烧大火用啥柴、烧细火用啥柴的计划。
    窦学凤摸清了家底，天天秤杆不离手，粮柴菜一月一清底，天天有计划，月月有余，食堂越办越好。
