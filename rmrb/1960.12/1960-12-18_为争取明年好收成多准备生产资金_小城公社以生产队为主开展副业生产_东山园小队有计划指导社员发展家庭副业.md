    To Prepare More Production Funds to Strive for a Good Harvest Next Year
    Xiaocheng Commune Develops Sideline Production with Production Teams as the Mainstay
    Dongshanyuan Team Provides Planned Guidance to Members in Developing Household Sideline Production
    (Our newspaper, Changchun, 17th dispatch) The Xiaocheng People's Commune in Shulan County, Jilin Province, with management areas (i.e., production teams, basic accounting units) as the mainstay, has organized communes, management areas, production teams, public canteens, and member families to carry out winter sideline production, increasing the income of members and preparing more funds for striving for a good harvest next year.
    Xiaocheng Commune is located in a semi-mountainous area, with very rich sideline resources. Since the beginning of winter, the commune has made sideline production plans at all levels, carrying out sideline production activities such as hunting, harvesting wild fibers, weaving, charcoal burning, collecting medicinal herbs, extracting pine root oil, making wooden products, and processing wild plants. By November 25th, in just over a month, the commune's sideline income reached 250,000 yuan, a twofold increase compared to the same period last year. Including the sideline income from the previous three quarters, it exceeded the annual sideline production plan by 13% ahead of schedule.
    In sideline production, the Xiaocheng People's Commune, adhering to the principles of three-level ownership, team-based accounting, and giving priority to the collective while also considering the individual, reasonably divided the scope of operations. Except for large-scale logging and a large-scale breeding farm that the original management area was unable to operate, which were operated by the commune, most of the sideline production projects and varieties were operated by the management area. Among them, a small part, which are perennial, fixed, high-income, and slow-return projects such as breeding farms, ginseng farms, thinning old wood, and wood processing, are directly operated by the management area. The remaining, and most numerous, seasonal projects suitable for decentralized operation and easy to combine with agricultural production, such as hunting, collecting medicinal herbs, harvesting mountain reed grass, and weaving, are contracted by the management area to the production teams. On the premise of ensuring the completion of the contracted production tasks assigned by the management area, the production teams also independently operated some small sideline businesses. For small and scattered sideline businesses that are not convenient for collective operation but suitable for members to operate in their spare time, such as weaving straw sandals and collecting medicinal herbs, members are encouraged to operate them individually, provided that they do not take up collective labor time and do not affect collective production. According to a survey, the proportion of sideline income from various sources of operation in the total output value of sideline production in the commune is: commune accounts for 5%, management area accounts for 70%, production team accounts for 15% (excluding sideline businesses contracted to the management area), and member household sideline accounts for about 10%.
    (Our newspaper, Guangzhou, 17th dispatch) The Dongshanyuan Team of the Fucheng Brigade of the Suicheng Commune in Leizhou County, Guangdong Province, while ensuring the success of collective production, actively helps members develop household sideline production. At present, the team members raise a large number of livestock and poultry, and the private plots are also well managed.
    The private plots of the Dongshanyuan Team members are generally planted with sweet potatoes. Cassava is interplanted in the sweet potato pits, and soybeans, cowpeas, radishes, cabbage, etc. are interplanted on the ridges. Papaya, bananas, pineapples, etc. are also planted on the edges of the gardens, making full use of every inch of land and achieving several harvests a year. Because the private plots are well managed, it has also promoted the production of household sideline businesses such as poultry and livestock. At present, the team members raise a total of 71 pigs and more than 900 chickens, ducks, and geese, and have provided the state with 18 commodity pigs and a batch of fruits, which has not only invigorated the market but also increased the income of the members.
    In order to guide the members in developing household sideline production, the Dongshanyuan Team has stipulated a system for members' attendance in collective production and the sale of household fertilizers. The team stipulates that male members must work 28 days a month and female members must work 26 days a month, and implement quota management. After completing the fixed attendance and quotas, members can use holidays and spare time to engage in household sideline businesses. In this way, members can both actively engage in collective production and manage household sideline businesses well. In November, all 165 laborers in the team completed their quotas except for one member household. Secondly, the team stipulates the task of selling household fertilizers every month according to the population of each household, and purchases them in cash according to quality and price. After completing the task of selling fertilizers, members can use the remaining fertilizers for private plot production. Therefore, members actively accumulate fertilizer, ensuring that pigs have pens and chickens and ducks have coops.

    为争取明年好收成多准备生产资金
    小城公社以生产队为主开展副业生产
    东山园小队有计划指导社员发展家庭副业
    本报长春17日电　吉林舒兰县小城人民公社以管理区（即生产队，基本核算单位）为主，分别组织了公社、管理区、生产小队、公共食堂和社员家庭，开展冬季副业生产，增加了社员收入，并为争取明年丰收准备了更多的资金。
    小城公社处在半山区，副业资源非常丰富。入冬以来，这个公社层层作出副业生产计划，开展了狩猎、割野生纤维、编织、烧木炭、采药材、熬松根油、搞木制品和野生植物加工等项副业生产。到11月25日，仅一个多月的时间，全社副业收入达二十五万元，比去年同期增长一倍。加上前三个季度的副业收入，超额13％提前完成全年副业生产计划。
    在副业生产中，小城人民公社本着三级所有、队为基础和以集体为主兼顾个人的原则，合理地划分了经营范围。除了原有的管理区无力经营的大型采伐和一个大型饲养场由公社经营外，大部分副业生产项目和品种都由管理区经营。其中有少部分是常年固定、收入多、收益慢的饲养场、人参场、间伐陈材、木材加工等大宗生产由管理区直接经营；其余为数最多的、季节性的、适合分散经营、便于同农业生产结合的狩猎、采药材、割山黄草、编织等中小型副业生产由管理区包给生产小队经营。生产小队在保证完成管理区交给的包产任务的前提下，还单独经营了一部分小宗副业。对于不便集体经营而适合社员利用工余时间经营的编草鞋、采药材等细小零星的副业，在不占用集体劳动时间和不影响集体生产的原则下，鼓励社员个人经营。据调查，这个公社各路经营的副业收入在全社副业生产产值中的比例是：公社占5％，管理区占70％，生产小队占15％（对管理区承包的副业不在内），社员家庭副业占10％左右。
    本报广州17日电　广东省雷州县遂城公社附城大队东山园小队，在保证搞好集体生产的前提下，积极帮助社员发展家庭副业。目前，全队社员家畜家禽养得很多，自留地生产也搞得好。
    东山园小队社员的自留地，一般以种植番薯为主。在薯坑套种木薯，畦头畦尾间种大豆、眉豆、萝卜、白菜等，在园边也种植木瓜、香蕉、菠萝等，做到寸土不荒，一年几熟。因为自留地经营得好，又促进了家禽家畜等家庭副业生产。目前全队社员共养猪七十一头，鸡鸭鹅九百多只，已为国家提供了十八头商品猪和一批水果，既活跃了市场，又增加了社员的收入。
    东山园小队为了指导社员发展家庭副业生产，规定了社员集体生产出勤和出售家庭肥料等制度。小队规定男社员每月出勤二十八天，女社员每月出勤二十六天，并实行定额管理。社员在完成定勤和定额以后，可以利用假日和工余时间，经营家庭副业。这样，社员既积极搞好集体生产，又搞好家庭副业。11月份，全队一百六十五个劳动力除一户社员没有完成定额外，其余都完成了定额。其次，小队根据各户人口规定每月交售家庭肥料的任务，按质论价，现金收购。社员在完成交售肥料任务以后，剩余肥料可以用于自留地生产。因此，社员都积极积肥，做到猪有圈，鸡鸭有栏。
