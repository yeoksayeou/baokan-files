Xinhua News Agency, Jilin, December 27th: This year, Jilin Chemical Industrial Company has completed its annual technical innovation and technical revolution plan as scheduled. The enterprise's production outlook has undergone significant changes. Various chemical production workshops have widely adopted new technologies and processes, shortening workflows and simplifying procedures. The company's actual production level has reached the targets stipulated in the plan; the output of major products such as synthetic ammonia has greatly increased compared to last year.

The company's technical innovation and technical revolution plan was formulated at the beginning of this year after extensive bottom-up discussions and top-down reviews at each level. After the plan was formulated, the company's Party committee and the Party committees of its affiliated factories immediately began organizing its implementation. Each workshop, construction site, and work section established one or more technical research groups. Soon, these groups developed into more than a thousand, involving over ten thousand people, forming a mass technical research network of "thousands of groups and ten thousands of people." The company also formed a professional research organization centered on the Design Institute, including eight experimental research units. This set of professional research organizations closely combined with the mass technical research network, merging into a strong and organized force, ensuring the reliable realization of the plan.

For the innovation projects specified in the plan, the company implemented them in batches and phases, item by item, to each technical group and research unit. Smaller projects were assigned to one group, larger projects to several groups, and major projects were handled collaboratively by many groups and professional research units, striving to concentrate superior forces to overcome them one by one. For example, to achieve automated production in the acetic acid workshop of the calcium carbide plant, forty-five technical research groups in the entire workshop were organized to cooperate with the factory's technical section, power workshop, and instrument workshop. The technical section sent technicians to reside in the workshop to provide technical guidance, and the power and instrument workshops sent workers to help install instruments, etc., completing twenty-two automation projects in a very short time.

In order to strengthen leadership, the Party branch secretaries of each workshop personally presided over the work of the technical research groups. Each workshop formed a core technical innovation group composed of the Party branch secretary, workshop director, technical personnel, and veteran workers, responsible for leading, organizing, and inspecting the work of each technical research group in the workshop. Within the groups, in addition to implementing the "three-way combination" of workers, cadres, and technicians, the "three-way combination" of chemical workers, mechanical workers, and electrical workers was also implemented, so that each group could not only propose plans and conduct experiments, but also carry out design and installation. The company also extensively organized full-time technical personnel to provide guidance to the mass technical groups and provide technical data. Therefore, the innovation projects undertaken by each group were completed very well. Over the year, the technical groups of the entire company completed a total of 1,680 innovation projects, including 266 major projects. These projects have now been put into production.

In the process of implementing the plan in batches and phases, the company also organized sixteen mass technical innovation campaigns this year. In each campaign, the technical groups of each workshop and work section focused on key production issues and proposed clear innovation goals. Small projects were strived to be resolved in one campaign, while large projects were resolved in phases over several campaigns. Consolidation work was carried out in the intervals between campaigns. One technical innovation campaign after another promoted the rapid development of the entire company from small-scale changes and innovations to large-scale changes and innovations, and from scattered and partial reforms to comprehensive and systematic revolutions. Now, not only has the production outlook of various chemical production workshops undergone significant changes, but also in the scheduling, control, machinery, power, transportation, and infrastructure systems serving chemical production, 22 workshops have achieved mechanization or semi-mechanization. The company's employees also vigorously engaged in the comprehensive utilization of waste gas, waste liquid, and waste residue, recovering many useful substances from these wastes and trial-producing various urgently needed chemical raw materials.

    吉林化工公司如期实现全年革新规划
    实际生产水平达到规定指标，主要产品产量大增长
    新华社吉林27日电　吉林化学工业公司今年已经如期实现了全年技术革新和技术革命规划。企业生产面貌发生了显著变化，各个化工生产车间广泛采用了新技术、新工艺，缩短了流程，简化了工序。全公司实际生产水平达到了规划规定的指标；主要产品合成氨等的产量都比去年有了很大的增长。
    这个公司的技术革新和技术革命规划，是今年年初经过自下而上的广泛讨论自上而下的逐级审查后制订出来的。规划制定以后，公司党委及所属各厂党委立即着手组织实现。每一个车间、工地和工段都建立了一个或几个技术研究小组。不久，这种小组就发展到一千多个，一万多人，形成了“千组万人”的群众性技术研究网。公司又组成以设计研究院为中心、包括八个试验研究单位的专业研究组织。这一套专业性研究组织与群众性技术研究网密切结合，汇合成了一支坚强的有组织的力量，使规划的实现有了可靠的保证。
    对于规划规定的革新项目，公司都是分批分期、逐项逐件地落实到每一个技术小组和研究单位。较小的项目落实到一个小组，较大的项目落实到几个小组，重大的项目则由许多小组和专业研究单位合作，力求集中优势力量各个击破。如电石厂醋酸车间为了实现自动化生产，组织全车间的四十五个技术研究小组，并与工厂技术科、动力车间、仪表车间合作，技术科派出技术员住在车间进行技术指导，动力和仪表车间派工人帮助安装仪表等，在很短时间内就完成了二十二个自动化项目。
    为了加强领导，各车间党支部书记都是亲自主持技术研究小组的工作，每个车间由党支部书记、车间主任、技术人员、老工人组成一个技术革新核心小组，负责领导、组织、检查车间各个技术研究小组的工作。在小组内部，除了实行工人、干部、技术人员的“三结合”以外，又实行化学工人、机械工人和电气工人的“三结合”，使每个小组既能提方案，搞试验，又能进行设计和安装。公司并且广泛组织专职技术人员到群众技术小组进行指导，提供技术资料。因此，各个小组担负的革新项目完成得很好。一年来，全公司各个技术小组共完成了革新项目一千六百八十个，其中重大项目有二百六十六个。这些项目现在都已投入生产。
    在分批分期实现规划的过程中，公司今年还组织了十六次群众性的技术革新大会战。每次会战，各个车间和工段的技术小组都针对生产关键，提出明确的革新目标。小的项目力求在一次会战中解决，大的项目则在几次会战中分期解决。会战的间隙就进行巩固工作。一次接一次的技术革新大会战，推动了全公司由小改小革迅速发展到大改大革，由分散的部分的改革发展到全面系统的革命。现在，不仅各个化工生产车间的生产面貌发生了显著变化，在为化工生产服务的调度、控制、机械、动力、运输、基建等系统中，也已有二十二个车间实现了机械化或半机械化。公司职工还大搞废气、废液、废渣的综合利用，从这些废物中收回了许多有用物质，试制成了多种急需的化工原料。
