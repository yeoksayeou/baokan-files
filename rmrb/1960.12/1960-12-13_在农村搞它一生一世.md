    To Devote My Whole Life to the Countryside
    Lü Meiying, Fire Line Shock Brigade, Jinlian No. 7 Team, Jinqiao Commune, Pudong County, Shanghai

    Three years ago, I was a student in a big city. I listened to the Party's call and settled down in the countryside to become the first generation of educated farmers. Not long after settling down, our area established people's communes, and the people's communes brought a new look to the countryside. Due to the needs of the Party, I was transferred to a mechanical factory to study. After completing my studies, I returned to the commune and was transferred to an agricultural machinery factory as a lathe operator. ...The changes in the three years after graduation are not small. I changed from a student to a farmer, then from a farmer to a worker, and then from a worker back to farming in the countryside. I want to devote my whole life to the countryside.

    When I settled down, our production team leader even taught me how to plow the land with oxen, but three years later, our large tracts of land are already plowed by tractors. Today, our irrigation not only uses diesel engines, but I also helped the commune install electric motors with comrades from the mechanical factory this New Year, and we have electric irrigation. Some of the things we longed for at that time have become a reality today, but there are still many, many farm works that are still completed by manual labor. We want to realize the mechanization and electrification of agriculture, not by waiting for the favor of others and God, but by working hard to obtain it. This requires thousands upon thousands of people, especially those who are conscious, educated, and knowledgeable. If we want to seize high yields, we must uncover the secrets of crops that are detrimental to high yields. From the time cotton blossoms to the time it bears cotton bolls, only less than 30% of its total flowers can bear cotton bolls. If the secret of cotton flower shedding is found, what a great and good thing it would be for the people! Can you say that such a person has no future or prospects? Also, we must strive to achieve the highest yield of the rapeseed we are currently planting. This is what every member of our shock brigade wants, but rapeseed has a deadly disease called virus disease that cannot be cured yet.

    In short, there are still many undiscovered secrets in agriculture waiting for people to discover and solve. These peaks of agricultural science are waiting for ambitious people to climb. Some people are afraid of the hardship of agricultural labor, and agricultural labor is indeed relatively hard, but we don't feel that way. Like now, we are working hard to plant rapeseed well. Our Party committee is very concerned about us and doesn't let us go out for night work, but we feel the more we do, the happier we are.

    在农村搞它一生一世
    上海市浦东县金桥公社金联七队火线突击队  吕美英
    三年前，我是大城市里的一个学生，听了党的话来到农村安家落户，当第一代有文化的农民。落户后不久，我们这里办起了人民公社，人民公社给农村带来新的面貌。由于党的需要，我又被调到机械厂学习，学习期满回公社又被调到农业机械厂当车工。……毕业后的三年变化是不小的，由学生变为农民，又由农民变为工人，再由工人回到农村种田。我要在农村搞它个一生一世。
    我落户的时候，我们的生产队长还教我用老牛耕地，但三年后的今天，我们的大片土地已经用拖拉机耕地。今天我们的灌溉不但用柴油机，我还和机械厂的同志在今年新年帮公社安装了电动机，有了电力灌溉。当时我们想望的事情有一些今天已成了现实，但是还有好多好多的农活仍旧用人力劳动来完成。我们要农业实现机械化电气化，不是等待别人和老天的恩赐，我们要用辛勤的劳动去索取，这样就需要千千万万的人，特别是有觉悟有文化有知识的人。我们要夺高产必须揭破农作物的不利于高产的秘密。棉花从开花到结棉桃，它的花能结棉桃的只有它全部花的30％还不到。如果棉花落花的秘密找到了，这样将为人民做了一件多么大、多么好的事呢？您能说这样的人没有出息，没有前途吗？还有，我们现在种的油菜，我们一定要把它搞得产量最高，这是我们每个突击队员所想的，可是油菜就有一种绝病，它害了毒素病现在还没有办法医好。
    总之，农业上还有很多没有被人们发现的秘密，等待人去发现解决。这些农业科学的高峰等待有志气的人攀登。有些人怕农业劳动艰苦，农业劳动确是比较艰苦的，可是我们却没有这样的感觉。像现在我们辛勤地干，要把油菜种好。我们的党委对我们非常关怀，不让我们出去开夜工，我们却觉得做得越多越高兴。
