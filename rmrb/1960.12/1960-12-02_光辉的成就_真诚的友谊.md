    Glorious Achievements, Sincere Friendship
    He Long, Head of the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to Korea
    As the people and armies of China and Korea warmly celebrate the historic festival of common victory—the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' entry into Korea to fight, the Military Friendship Delegation of the People's Republic of China, at the invitation of Comrade Kim Kwang-hyup, Minister of National Defense of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, visited our brotherly and close neighbor. From our arrival in Pyongyang on October 23rd to our departure from the Korean border on November 11th, the delegation spent twenty unforgettable days in Korea. Thanks to the personal care of Comrade Kim Il-sung, and the meticulous arrangements of Comrade Kim Kwang-hyup and the leaders of the People's Army, we had a very pleasant, very satisfying, and very beneficial visit. We were left with indelible and positive impressions of the glorious achievements made by the Korean people and army under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung in the cause of building and defending their country, and their sincere friendship towards the Chinese people and army.
    The delegation and the Chinese People's Liberation Army Cultural Troupe it led, entered the beautiful Korean land on the morning of October 23rd, filled with the deep memories of the Chinese people and army, and all former members of the Chinese People's Volunteers, for the Korean people and the comrades-in-arms of the People's Army. From that moment on, we were constantly surrounded by the warm friendship of the Korean people and the comrades-in-arms of the People's Army. The delegation was warmly welcomed by the leaders of the Korean Workers' Party, government, and army, as well as the broad masses of the people. We were received by Comrade Kim Il-sung, the respected leader of the Korean people, and other leading comrades. We participated in the grand rally held in Pyongyang to commemorate the tenth anniversary of "October 25th" and watched the brilliant performances of Korean artists. The Chinese People's Liberation Army Cultural Troupe held its opening performance at the newly built Pyongyang Grand Theater on October 26th, which was unanimously praised and encouraged by the Korean Party and state leaders headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung and all the audience. The delegation visited Pyongyang, Huichang, Kaesong, Songnim, Heechon, Wonsan, Kumgangsan, Hamhung, Chongjin, and Juul, among other places. Wherever we went, the Korean people and army treated us as if we were their own family. Wherever the delegation went, the festive atmosphere was overflowing. Colorful paper flowers often covered the bodies of the delegation comrades; cheers and songs could be heard everywhere. The delegation had extensive contact with leading comrades at all levels in Korea, as well as our brotherly Korean workers, farmers, and People's Army comrades-in-arms, exchanging experiences and reminiscing about the past. When we finally bid farewell at Namyang Station, the delegation comrades and our Korean friends were reluctant to part, and everyone was moved to tears by the emotional farewell. We clearly knew that the Korean people's warm hospitality and grand welcome to the delegation were a manifestation of their deep friendship with the Chinese people and army, and we should convey all of this to the people of our motherland and all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
    During this visit, we were excited to see the selfless labor enthusiasm of the hardworking and intelligent Korean people and the glorious victories achieved on the construction front. As everyone knows, the war of aggression launched by the US imperialists brought tremendous disasters to the Korean people. After suffering a disastrous defeat on the front lines, the vicious enemy madly bombed peaceful cities and villages in Korea, vainly attempting to raze the northern half of Korea to the ground with a large number of bombs and gasoline bombs. Therefore, when the Chinese and Korean people won the great victory of the Korean armistice after three years of war, the Korean people faced extremely serious difficulties. Almost all important cities, factories, and enterprises were destroyed. The heroic city of Pyongyang suffered continuous bombing by the enemy during the war, and not a single complete building remained on the ground. The heroic port city of Wonsan on the east coast was completely destroyed by enemy bombs and shells. The situation in other cities was largely the same. The Korean people rebuilt their homes on the ruins. Under the leadership of the Workers' Party, the wounds of the war were quickly healed through the efforts of all the people. Then, the Workers' Party put forward the basic line for post-war economic construction and started the first five-year economic construction plan in 1957. The total industrial output value stipulated in this plan was victoriously completed ahead of schedule in only two and a half years. This year's total industrial output value will increase by 2.5 times compared to 1956, 5.4 times compared to 1949 before the war, and 6.7 times compared to 1944 before liberation. A country with a backward economy that had suffered greatly from war was quickly built into a socialist industrial and agricultural country with a self-sufficient economic base. In Pyongyang, we saw the newly built textile factory with modern technological equipment. At the Hwanghae Iron Works, we saw that the factory, whose entire equipment was destroyed by the US aggressors during the war (an average of one bomb every two square meters), resumed production in less than a year, using materials and equipment all made by the Korean people themselves, and new blast furnaces and coking furnaces were built. The Heechon Machine Tool Plant, established in 1951 during the intense war, has now developed into a large-scale machine manufacturing factory with modern equipment. In the Hamhung area, huge chemical and mechanical industries majestically appeared on the ground. The workers of the Hungnam Fertilizer Plant rebuilt the factory on a pile of ruins in less than two years, and now the factory's output is 3.3 times higher than before the war. The workers of the Longcheng Machinery Plant displayed their creative spirit, boldly innovated technology, and manufactured large machine tools that had never been produced before. The Bunkung Chemical Factory was severely damaged during the war, but it resumed production in only five months after the war and expanded its factory buildings. In Chongjin City, we saw that the steel plant, whose equipment was 80% destroyed by the enemy, has not only been completely restored, but also its output this year will increase to 2.6 times that of 1944. Relying on the collective wisdom of the workers, they mastered the technology of smelting granular iron in rotary furnaces using anthracite coal. We were pleased to see that cities such as Pyongyang, Wonsan, Hamhung, and Chongjin have been built even more beautifully than before the war. The great achievements made by the Korean working class under the leadership of the Workers' Party fill us with sincere joy and admiration.
    In agriculture, after the armistice, under the leadership of the Workers' Party, agricultural cooperativization was quickly realized, and the socialist transformation of the agricultural economy was completed. One million farm households across the country have been organized into more than 3,800 cooperatives. This is a great revolution in the Korean countryside. On this basis, the Party led the farmers and basically realized the water conservancy and electrification of the countryside. Now 88% of the countryside has electricity. The total irrigated area of paddy and dry land in northern Korea is equivalent to seven times that before liberation. At present, the Korean farmers, under the leadership of the Party and with the strong support of the working class and the people of the whole country, are advancing in the direction of full mechanization. This year, agriculture has achieved a bumper harvest. It is estimated that this year's grain output will reach 3.803 million tons, which is 40% more than the highest annual output before liberation and more than double the output in 1946 after liberation. The grain output plan for 1961 stipulated in the first five-year plan has been overfulfilled. Other productions such as vegetables, livestock, economic crops, fruits, and sericulture have also made great achievements. The delegation visited the Shangyang China-Korea Friendship Agricultural Cooperative in Sunan County. This cooperative was established in December 1953 by twelve martyr family members (poor peasants) and has now developed into a large-scale cooperative including 756 households and more than 1,500 people. The cooperative now has 1,620 hectares of land, 327 cattle, 671 pigs, 13 tractors, 65 threshing machines, two cars, and six carts. This year, rice and cotton have both achieved bumper harvests. There are no illiterates in the cooperative. There are clinics, kindergartens, nurseries, bathhouses, wired broadcasting, and clubs in the cooperative. Through this cooperative, we can see that Korean farmers have embarked on an infinitely beautiful road of development.
    Due to the rapid development of industry and agriculture, the material and cultural life of the Korean people has also been significantly improved and elevated, and the people are filled with joyful emotions. The situation where the war brought about insufficient food and clothing and a serious shortage of housing has fundamentally changed. We have seen that a large number of new houses have been built and are continuing to be built, both in cities and in the countryside. The quality of people's clothing has greatly improved. According to statistics, the poor peasants, who accounted for 40% of all farmers at the time of the armistice, have now been raised to the level of middle peasants. Universal secondary compulsory education has been implemented throughout the country. The Korean people, who are good at singing and dancing, have carried forward the excellent traditions of national art under the leadership of the Party, and the cultural and artistic fields are presenting a prosperous scene. We watched the amateur performances of art groups and workers and soldiers in Pyongyang and other cities and were deeply attracted by their brilliant performances full of revolutionary optimism and fighting spirit. We can see everywhere that joyful smiles naturally flow from the healthy faces of the masses. As Comrade Kim Il-sung said: "All life in North Korea is very pleasant, full of hope and joy. People have been freed from all kinds of exploitation and oppression, and are no longer threatened by unemployment and hunger. They all work equally without worry, all study equally, and all live happy lives. This is precisely the reality of the northern half today. It is the life of our people under the socialist system."
  (From the report at the celebration of the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Korea)
    At present, all the Korean people are confidently welcoming the seven-year plan for the development of the national economy proposed by the Party. The realization of this grand plan will enable Korea's socialist construction to climb to higher peaks and build Korea into a developed socialist country. In order to create a more beautiful future, all the Korean people have inherited and carried forward the spirit of hard struggle, even though their material living conditions have greatly improved but are not yet very abundant. We can see everywhere the moving image of hardworking Korean women actively participating in labor, and see young students enthusiastically participating in socialist construction under the policy of combining education with productive labor. We firmly believe that, with the concerted efforts of the Korean people, the seven-year plan for the development of the national economy will surely be successfully realized.
    The Korean people have been able to achieve such glorious achievements in a short period of time because of the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung. The Party timely pointed out the goals of struggle to the people, put forward the correct line, and inspired the fighting courage and confidence of the masses. We have seen everywhere that the people show sincere love and infinite trust for their Party and their respected leader Comrade Kim Il-sung from the bottom of their hearts. The Korean people, united around the Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, which has one million members, have exerted tremendous and unparalleled power and created miracles rarely seen in history. The Korean Workers' Party concentrated and represented the will and desire of the Korean people to quickly change their backwardness, used the mass line, and launched a great upsurge in socialist construction among all the people, launching the Chollima Movement. The Chollima Work Team Movement is a revolutionary competition movement of the broad masses, and it is also a communist labor movement in which the advanced help the backward and lead the backward. It is a great driving force for promoting the high-speed advancement of socialist construction in Korea. At present, more than 227,000 people have participated in this movement, and it has been widely carried out in factories, enterprises, rural areas, schools, hospitals, cultural and artistic organizations, and other departments. During our visit, we met and talked with many members of the Chollima Work Team. Their full revolutionary drive, active creative spirit, and noble communist style left us with a deep impression. We fully believe that the heroic Korean people will continue to advance bravely on the road of socialist construction with the bold pace of riding on the Chollima.
    In Korea, we also saw that our close comrades-in-arms—the Korean People's Army—have achieved great achievements in the struggle to defend peace and defend their country, and in the cause of further strengthening the army's construction. The People's Army, which has undergone severe tests in the struggle against imperialist aggression, has been guarding the eastern forefront of the socialist camp for seven years as if it were a single day since the armistice. Whether in the leading organs at all levels of the People's Army or in various units, whether on the front lines or in the rear, we strongly felt that all officers and soldiers of the People's Army are full of anger and contempt for imperialism. They maintain a high degree of vigilance against the US imperialists' conspiracy to undermine the Korean armistice and attempt to rekindle the flames of war. We once heard an officer of the People's Army say to us: "If the US aggressors dare to invade us again, we will definitely give them a devastating blow." The young soldiers of the People's Army also said to us: "We will not be demobilized until we drive the US aggressors out of South Korea." We believe that these words represent the common will of all officers and soldiers of the People's Army. This will has been implemented in the actual actions of the People's Army. We have seen that if the US imperialists dare to invade again, the People's Army is ready to strike at the invading enemy at any time. Our brotherly Korean People's Army is a strong force against imperialist aggression and defending peace in the Far East. In order to victoriously complete the arduous tasks it undertakes, the People's Army, under the close attention of the Korean Workers' Party and Comrade Kim Il-sung, constantly improves the army's political and military qualities, attaches great importance to political and ideological work, and puts forward the call of "political and ideological work comes first." The People's Army has carried out effective work in strengthening the Party's leadership over the army, strengthening the unity within the army, and strengthening the unity between the army and the people. Among all officers and soldiers of the People's Army, education on inheriting and carrying forward revolutionary traditions has been vigorously carried out, and great importance has been attached to the publicity of heroic and model figures and deeds, using these living examples to educate all soldiers. The People's Army attaches great importance to educating its officers and soldiers with Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and pays attention to constantly eliminating all bourgeois, revisionist, and dogmatic poisons in order to maintain the purity of the army's political ideology and its high fighting will. In the military field, the People's Army cherishes the precious experience gained with blood in the Fatherland Liberation War and pays attention to studying military theory in combination with the actual situation of its own country. During our visits, we were pleased to see that the People's Army's air force, navy, and artillery units demonstrated highly skilled techniques in mastering and operating modern weapons. The People's Army has a good style of work, officers and soldiers get along well, the military appearance is neat, the actions are rapid, and the life is active. While carrying out the task of defending the motherland, the People's Army also actively participates in socialist construction. Many units and schools have carried out sideline production such as raising livestock and planting vegetables. At the construction site of the Hamhung Vinalon Factory, we saw thousands of People's Army comrades-in-arms participating in the construction of the factory, many of whom have learned to read blueprints, pour cement, and are about to reach the level of technicians. Our comrades-in-arms are thus gloriously carrying out the dual tasks of defending the motherland and building the motherland. We are proud and honored to have such a heroic People's Army standing firmly on the eastern outpost of the socialist camp. Many valuable combat experiences and army-building experiences of the People's Army are worthy of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's humble learning.
    In Korea, we saw that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has made unremitting efforts for the peaceful reunification of its own country and has achieved remarkable achievements. For fifteen years, Korea has been artificially divided into two parts, north and south, which is entirely the result of the US imperialists stubbornly staying in South Korea and insisting on implementing a policy of aggression and division against Korea. In order to realize the peaceful reunification of its own country as soon as possible, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has made consistent and sincere efforts. On February 5, 1958, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue by the Korean people themselves. By October of this year, the Chinese People's Volunteers had all withdrawn from Korea. However, the US aggressor troops have not yet withdrawn from southern Korea. At the "August 15th" celebration of the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Korea this year, Comrade Kim Il-sung once again put forward a new plan for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue on behalf of the Korean government, advocating the implementation of the Korean federal system in northern and southern Korea as a transitional measure to solve the problem of peaceful reunification of Korea. The Korean government has also repeatedly put forward reasonable suggestions such as strengthening economic and cultural exchanges between the north and the south. All these plans and suggestions have won the warm support of all the Korean people and the praise and support of the people all over the world; however, they have been barbarously rejected by the US imperialists and their running dogs, the reactionary rulers of South Korea. The true purpose of the US aggressors is well known to the world. This is to insist on its brutal colonial rule over South Korea, to insist on turning the southern half of Korea into an advanced base for it to launch new wars of aggression, and to plot to re-ignite the war of aggression at an appropriate time, attack the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, annex the whole of Korea, and then comprehensively undermine world peace and launch a new world war in order to realize its dream of dominating the world. Of course, the plans of the imperialists and all reactionaries are doomed to failure. The Korean issue will ultimately be decided and resolved by the Korean people themselves. The great storm of the South Korean people's anti-US and anti-Syngman Rhee movement in March and April this year is a vivid manifestation of the great power of the Korean people. An area that was once an important base of US aggression has turned into a raging anti-US volcano in the blink of an eye. The Korean people clearly recognize that the US imperialist occupation and enslavement is the source of all the suffering and disasters of the South Korean people. Therefore, as long as the US aggressor troops do not withdraw from South Korea for a day, and the US enslavement rule over South Korea does not end for a day, the Korean people's struggle will not stop for a day. The heroic struggle and glorious victory of the people in the northern half of Korea have greatly inspired the people in the southern half and illuminated their path to liberation. The Korean people's revolutionary forces, with the northern half as a democratic base, have an overwhelming advantage over the reactionary forces. After our visit to Korea, we have become more firm in our consistent belief: the people of southern Korea, who are temporarily under the rule of US imperialism and the reactionaries, will surely return to the embrace of their motherland, and the three thousand miles of beautiful rivers and mountains of Korea will surely achieve complete reunification. There is no force in the world that can stop the final victory of the Korean people's great cause of peaceful reunification of their motherland.
    In addition to seeing the glorious achievements of the Korean people on all fronts, the delegation deeply felt the Korean people's lofty proletarian internationalist spirit during this visit. All the comrades of the delegation had such a feeling that through this visit, we received another vivid internationalist education of Marxism-Leninism. The sincere friendship shown by the Korean people and the comrades-in-arms of the People's Army towards the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army through the delegation deeply moved us.
    There is a historical tradition of friendship between the people of China and Korea. In the struggle against imperialist aggression for nearly a century, the people of the two countries have shared life and death and are closely related. However, it was the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution and the spread of Marxism-Leninism in the two countries that introduced the friendship between the people of our two countries into a new historical period. From this time on, the working people of the two countries, under the banner of invincible Marxism-Leninism, closely united and carried out a common struggle against the common enemy, the imperialists. The outstanding sons and daughters of the Korean people have successively participated in China's first and second domestic revolutionary wars, the Anti-Japanese War, and the third domestic revolutionary war. Korean communists headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung once fought alongside the Chinese people against Japanese imperialism for a long time and made great contributions to the Chinese people's anti-Japanese struggle. In the long and arduous struggle, many Korean comrades bravely sacrificed their lives. It can be said that not only the blood of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, but also the blood of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Korean people dyed our five-star red flag and the August 1st military flag red. At the critical moment when US imperialism launched the Korean War, occupied our territory of Taiwan, and attempted to directly attack our country, the Korean people defended their motherland with heroic combat and at the same time guaranteed the safety and peaceful construction of our country. The Chinese People's Volunteers received great support and strong cooperation from the Korean people and the People's Army in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. It should be said that in the relationship of mutual help and support between our two countries, the Korean people's help to us came earlier and lasted longer. We should never forget this lofty internationalist spirit of our brotherly Korean people.
    The eight years from October 1950, when the Chinese People's Volunteers entered Korea to fight, to October 1958, when the Volunteers completely withdrew from Korea, were an extremely important period in the history of friendship between China and Korea. During this period, the fighting friendship between the people of the two countries, forged with blood, was unprecedentedly developed and reached a historical peak. It has been two years since the Volunteers withdrew from Korea, and the Korean people's memory of the Volunteers has not diminished in the slightest, but has become even deeper. We saw that Korea held grand commemorative activities for the tenth anniversary of "October 25th" throughout the country. Lecture meetings and forums were held in various places. A grand Chinese Film Week was held from October 22nd, and nearly 40 Chinese films were screened in cinemas across the country. Around October 25th, wreaths were presented to the Cemetery of the Martyrs of the Volunteers or tombs from Pyongyang to various provinces and cities. Our delegation presented a wreath at the "Friendship Tower" built in a corner of Mao Zedong Street in Pyongyang together with the leaders of the Korean Party and government organs and people from all walks of life in Pyongyang. When we presented wreaths at the former headquarters of the Volunteers and the Cemetery of the Martyrs of the Volunteers in Kaesong City, we saw that both cemeteries were filled with wreaths presented by local leading organs and the people, and a bouquet of flowers was presented in front of each martyr's tomb. When we drove through the Korean countryside, we saw many monuments surrounded by flowers and wreaths among the green pines and cypresses, which were all dedicated by the Korean people to the Volunteer martyrs who died in Korea with the feelings of commemorating their own relatives. Speaking of this, we have a responsibility to extend our condolences to all the families who sacrificed their loved ones in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and tell you: the blood of your loved ones was not shed in vain. They used their blood to irrigate the flowers of friendship between the people of China and Korea. They will not only be eternally commemorated by the Chinese people, but also by the Korean people.
    The friendship between the people of China and Korea is deeply rooted among the people. We saw that the Korean people expressed sincere love for the Chinese people and for our great leader Chairman Mao. We heard the masses and People's Army soldiers singing "The East is Red" in Chinese in many places. In Kaesong, we met Comrade Liu Mei, a Volunteer's mother, who ran from more than a hundred miles away to give the delegation the best ginseng that their agricultural team had cultivated for six years. In Pyongyang, we met Comrade Shi Jirong, a model in supporting the front, who was disabled by the enemy while digging wild vegetables for the Volunteers during the war; we also met Volunteer mothers Li Xingfeng and Park Neng-soo. In Hamhung, we saw two old men who had walked eighty kilometers from the Changjin Lake to see the delegation in the welcoming crowd. One was Comrade Hong Yixuan, who served as a guide for the Volunteers to transport artillery shells and fought with the Volunteers during the war, and the other was Comrade Jin Peiyun, who rescued wounded Volunteers on the front line. They were both elderly men, and when they saw the delegation, they said excitedly: "We miss you very much!". They each brought a bag of the best pine nuts to give to the delegation to express their feelings. The many vivid facts we saw in Korea convinced us that the friendship between China and Korea, which is based on Marxism-Leninism and forged with blood, is deeply rooted, leafy, and evergreen. No force in the world can destroy it. It will last forever like Mount Baekdu and the Yalu River.
    At present, the people and armies of China and Korea share the common task of defending world peace and striving for the unification of their respective motherlands. The common and vicious enemy of the people of China and Korea and the people of the world, US imperialism, still occupies the southern half of Korea and our sacred territory of Taiwan. US imperialism insists on implementing a policy of aggression against our two countries, actively preparing for new wars, and constantly carrying out military provocations, seriously threatening the security of our two countries and peace in the Far East and the world. The people of China and Korea love peace and oppose war. The governments of the two countries, representing the will of the people, have made consistent and unremitting efforts to strive for lasting peace and to achieve peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems; in the future, they will continue to resolutely struggle to safeguard world lasting peace and strive for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. However, we have drawn a lesson from the long-term struggle against the imperialists: peace cannot be begged for. The realization of the Korean armistice was not only due to the success of the negotiation struggle, but first and foremost because the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers resolutely resisted the US imperialist aggression and defeated the enemy on the battlefield. The enemy had no choice but to sign the armistice agreement and admit defeat. Since the armistice, the US imperialists have painstakingly undermined the armistice agreement, illegally transported new types of weapons such as atomic weapons into southern Korea, and expanded the South Korean army to twice its size at the time of the armistice. From the armistice to the end of September this year, there have been 915 incidents of the US side violating the armistice agreement that have been formally submitted for discussion. Only because the people of China and Korea have persisted in a serious struggle to maintain the armistice agreement and maintained a high degree of vigilance against the enemy, because the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is unprecedentedly strong, and because the people of the world oppose it, and also because the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has made meaningful efforts for many years, the US imperialists have not dared to completely tear up the armistice agreement so far, and the armistice situation in Korea has been able to be maintained. The US imperialists have not learned the necessary lessons from the failure of the Korean War. The jackal nature of the imperialist aggressors cannot be changed. Facing the US imperialists, who harbor deep hatred for the people of China and Korea and are armed to the teeth, we must not relax our vigilance in the slightest. In our talks with our brotherly Korean people and People's Army comrades-in-arms in Korea, both sides often mentioned these words: if the US imperialists dare to invade us again, for our common security and for world peace, the people of our two countries will once again join hands and fight side by side until we completely, cleanly, and thoroughly eliminate the invading enemy. We believe that this is the common determination of the people of our two countries. We are in the great era when the East wind prevails over the West wind. The characteristic of the current world situation is that socialist forces are further surpassing imperialist forces, national liberation forces are further surpassing colonialist forces, people's forces are further surpassing reactionary forces, and peace forces are further surpassing imperialist war forces. The current international situation is more favorable to us than it was in 1950 when the United States launched the Korean War. Our strength has become increasingly strong, while the strength of our enemies has become increasingly weak. Ten years ago, the US imperialists still had an advantage in atomic weapons, and their paper tiger face had not yet been completely seen through by the world, but at this time they were beaten to a bloody pulp by the people of China and Korea; ten years later today, the United States has lagged far behind the Soviet Union in new weapons, and its paper tiger face has been completely exposed. If it dares to attack us again, there is no doubt that it will be smashed to pieces and completely defeated. We believe that, with the joint struggle of the people of the world, the war policy and aggression policy of US imperialism can be defeated, and world peace can be maintained. The great friendship and unity between the people of China and Korea are invincible forces. We must spare no effort to constantly consolidate and develop this friendship and unity. We, the Chinese people and army, must always stand together with the Korean people and army, no matter what the circumstances, and valiantly advance towards our common lofty goal—opposing imperialist aggression, defending world peace, and striving for the complete victory of socialism and communism.

    在这次访问中，我们兴奋地看到了勤劳智慧的朝鲜人民忘我的劳动热情，和在建设战线上取得的光辉胜利。大家知道，美帝国主义者发动的侵朝战争，给朝鲜人民带来了巨大的灾难。凶恶的敌人，在前线遭到惨败之后，恶毒地对朝鲜的和平城市和乡村进行了疯狂的轰炸，妄想凭借大量炸弹、汽油弹，把朝鲜北半部夷为平地。因此，当朝中人民经过三年战争，赢得了朝鲜停战的伟大胜利的时候，朝鲜人民面临着极其严重的困难。几乎所有的重要城市、工厂和企业都被破坏了。英雄的城市平壤，战时遭到敌人连续不断的轰炸，地面上没有剩下一幢完整的楼房；东海岸上的英雄港口元山市，被敌人的炸弹、炮弹全部摧毁；其它城市的情况也大体相同。朝鲜人民是在废墟上重建自己的家园的。在劳动党的领导下，经过全体人民的努力，迅速地医治了战争的创伤。接着，劳动党又提出了战后经济建设的基本路线，于1957年开始了第一个五年经济建设计划。这个计划规定的工业总产值，只用了两年半的时间就提前胜利完成了。今年的工业总产值将比1956年增长二点五倍，比战前1949年增长五点四倍，比解放前1944年增长六点七倍。一个经济本来落后而又饱受战争摧残的国家，很快地建设成为拥有自给自足经济基础的社会主义工业农业国家。我们在平壤看到了新建立起来的拥有现代技术设备的纺织工厂。在黄海制铁所看到了在战争时期被美国侵略者炸毁了全部设备的工厂（平均每两平方米落弹一枚），只用了不到一年的时间，全部使用朝鲜人民自己制造的材料和设备恢复了生产，建成了新的高炉和炼焦炉。在1951年战争激烈进行中建立的熙川机床厂，现在已经发展成为一个具有现代化设备的大规模的机器制造工厂。在咸兴地区，巨大的化学工业和机械工业，雄伟地出现在地面上。兴南化肥厂的工人们，在一片废墟上用不到两年的时间重建了工厂，现在工厂产品的产量比战前提高了三点三倍。龙城机械厂的工人们发挥了创造精神，大胆革新技术，制造出了从未生产过的大型机床。本宫化学工厂在战时曾遭到严重破坏，战后只用五个月的时间就恢复了生产，并且扩建了厂房。在清津市，我们看到被敌人破坏了设备的80％的炼钢厂，现在不但完全恢复起来，而且今年的产量将增长为1944年的二点六倍。他们依靠工人的集体智慧，掌握了用无烟煤在回转炉中炼粒铁的技术。我们高兴地看到，平壤、元山、咸兴、清津等城市，都建设得比战前更加美丽了。朝鲜工人阶级在劳动党领导下所取得的巨大成就，使我们感到由衷的喜悦和钦佩。
    在农业方面，停战以后，在劳动党的领导下，很快实现了农业合作化，完成了农业经济的社会主义改造。全国一百万农户，被组织在三千八百多个合作社里面。这是朝鲜农村的一个伟大的革命。在此基础上，党领导着农民，基本上实现了农村的水利化和电气化。现在88％的农村有了电。朝鲜北部水旱田总灌溉面积相当于解放前的七倍。目前朝鲜农民们正在党的领导下、在工人阶级和全国人民强有力的支援下，向全面机械化的方向前进。今年农业获得了大丰收。预计今年的粮食产量将达到三百八十万三千吨，这比解放前的最高年产量增加40％，比解放后1946年的产量增加一倍以上。第一个五年计划所规定的1961年粮食计划产量被超额完成了。其它如蔬菜、畜产、经济作物、水果和养蚕等生产，也都取得了巨大成就。代表团曾经参观了顺安郡的上阳朝中友谊农业合作社。这个社是在1953年12月由十二户烈士家属（贫农）组成的，现在已经发展为包括七百五十六户，共一千五百多人的大规模的合作社。全社现有一千六百二十公顷土地，三百二十七头牛，六百七十一头猪，十三台拖拉机，六十五台脱谷机，两辆汽车，六辆推车。今年水稻、棉花都获得了丰收。全社已经没有文盲。社内有诊疗所、幼儿园、托儿所、澡堂、有线广播、俱乐部等。通过这个社，我们可以看到，朝鲜农民已经走上了无限美好的发展道路。
    由于工农业的迅速发展，朝鲜人民的物质文化生活，也跟着有了显著的改善和提高，人民群众充满着欢乐的情绪。战争带给人们的衣食十分不足，住宅严重缺乏的情况，已经有了根本的改变。我们看到，无论在城市、在农村，大批新的住宅已经建成和正在继续修建。人们的衣着质量大大提高了。据统计，农村中在停战时占全体农民40％的贫农，现在已经提高到中农的水平。全国普遍实行了中等义务教育。能歌善舞的朝鲜人民，在党的领导下发扬了民族艺术的优良传统，文化艺术园地呈现出一片繁荣景象。我们在平壤和其它城市，观看了艺术团体和工人、士兵们的业余演出，深为他们充满革命乐观主义和战斗气息的精采表演所吸引。我们到处都可以看到，在群众健康的面容上，自然地流露出欢乐的笑容。正如金日成同志所说的：“北朝鲜人民的一切生活都很愉快，充满着希望和喜悦，人们都摆脱了各种剥削和压迫，再也不受失业和饥饿的威胁，无愁无忧地都同样地工作、都同样地学习、都同样地过着幸福生活；这正是今天北半部的现实，是社会主义制度下我国人民的生活。”
  （在庆祝朝鲜解放十五周年大会上的报告）
    目前，全体朝鲜人民正满怀信心地迎接党所提出的人民经济发展七年计划。这个宏伟计划的实现，将使朝鲜的社会主义建设攀登上更高的高峰，把朝鲜建设成为发达的社会主义国家。为了创造更加美好的未来，全体朝鲜人民在物质生活条件虽有很大改善、但还不十分充裕的情况下，继承和发扬了艰苦奋斗的精神。我们到处可以看到，勤劳的朝鲜妇女积极参加劳动的动人形象，看到青年学生们，在教育与生产劳动相结合的方针下，热情地参加社会主义建设事业。我们深信，在朝鲜人民的一致努力下，人民经济发展七年计划，是一定能够胜利实现的。
    朝鲜人民在很短的期间内能够取得如此光辉的成就，是因为有着以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的正确领导。党及时地向人民指明了奋斗的目标，提出了正确的路线，鼓舞了群众的斗争勇气和信心。我们在各地都看到人民群众对自己的党、对自己敬爱的领袖金日成同志表现出发自内心的热诚爱戴和无限信赖。团结在以金日成同志为首的拥有百万党员的劳动党周围的朝鲜人民，发挥了巨大无比的力量，创造了历史罕见的奇迹。朝鲜劳动党集中和代表了朝鲜人民迅速改变落后面貌的意志和愿望，运用群众路线，在全民中掀起了社会主义建设大高潮，展开了千里马运动。千里马作业班运动，是广大群众的革命竞赛运动，也是先进帮落后、带落后的共产主义劳动运动，它是推动朝鲜社会主义建设高速度前进的伟大动力。目前参加这个运动的已有二十二万七千多人，它已经在工厂、企业以及农村、学校、医院、文化艺术机关等部门中普遍开展起来。我们在访问中同不少的千里马作业班的班员们见过面，交谈过，他们那种充沛的革命干劲，积极的创造精神，和高尚的共产主义风格，给我们留下了深刻的印象。我们完全相信，英雄的朝鲜人民必将继续以跨上千里马的豪迈步伐，在社会主义建设大道上奋勇前进。
    我们在朝鲜还看到了我们亲密的战友——朝鲜人民军，在保卫和平、保卫祖国的斗争中，在进一步加强军队建设的事业中，获得了巨大的成就。在反抗帝国主义侵略的斗争中经受了严重考验的人民军，停战以来，七年如一日地守卫在社会主义阵营东方的最前线。我们无论是在人民军各级领导机关中或在各个部队中，无论是在前沿阵地上或是在后方，都强烈地感觉到，人民军全体官兵对帝国主义充满着愤怒和蔑视。对美帝国主义蓄谋破坏朝鲜停战，企图重新燃起战火的阴谋，保持着高度的警惕。我们曾经听到人民军军官对我们说：“如果美国侵略者胆敢再来侵犯我们，我们一定要给以毁灭性的打击”。人民军的青年战士也曾对我们说：“不把美国侵略者赶出南朝鲜就不复员”。我们认为，这些话代表了人民军全体官兵的共同意志。这种意志已经贯彻在人民军的实际行动中。我们看到，美帝国主义如果敢于再来侵犯，人民军是做好了随时打击进犯敌人的准备的。我们兄弟的朝鲜人民军是一支反抗帝国主义侵略、保卫远东和平的坚强力量。为了胜利完成自己担负的艰巨任务，人民军在朝鲜劳动党和金日成同志的亲切关注下，不断地提高军队的政治和军事素质，极为重视政治思想工作，提出了“政治思想工作先行”的号召。在加强党对军队的领导、加强军队内部团结和军队同人民群众的团结方面，人民军都进行了成效卓著的工作。在人民军全体官兵中，大力进行了继承和发扬革命传统的教育，十分重视英雄模范人物和事迹的宣传，以这些活生生的例子来教育全体军人。人民军非常重视用马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义精神来教育自己的官兵，注意不断地清除一切资产阶级的、修正主义的、教条主义的毒素，以保持军队政治思想的纯洁和高昂的战斗意志。在军事方面，人民军十分珍视在祖国解放战争中用鲜血换来的宝贵经验，注意结合自己国家的实际情况研究军事理论。我们在参观访问中高兴地看到，人民军的空军、海军和炮兵部队，在掌握和操作现代武器方面，表现了高度熟练的技巧。人民军有着良好的作风，官兵融洽，军容严整，动作迅速，生活活跃。在执行保卫祖国任务的同时，人民军还积极地参加了社会主义建设事业。许多部队、学校已经进行了饲养家畜、种植蔬菜等副业生产。我们在咸兴维尼龙工厂建筑工地上，看到成千的人民军战友参加了该厂建设，其中许多人已经学会了看图纸，灌注水泥，快要达到技术工人的水平。我们的战友们，就是这样光荣地执行着保卫祖国和建设祖国的双重任务。有着这样一支英雄的人民军队坚定地站在社会主义阵营东方的前哨，使我们感到骄傲和自豪。人民军许多宝贵的作战经验和建军经验，是值得中国人民解放军虚心学习的。
    我们在朝鲜看到，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府为了和平统一自己祖国所进行的不懈努力，已经取得了卓著的成就。十五年来，朝鲜被人为地分成南北两个部分，这完全是美帝国主义者死赖在南朝鲜不走、坚持对朝鲜实行侵略政策和分裂政策的结果。为了尽快实现自己国家的和平统一，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府作了始终一贯的具有诚意的努力。1958年2月5日，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府发表了关于撤出一切外国军队、朝鲜问题由朝鲜人民自己和平解决的声明。到这一年的10月间中国人民志愿军即全部撤离了朝鲜。但是，美国的侵略军队至今没有从朝鲜南部撤走。在今年“八·一五”朝鲜解放十五周年纪念会上，金日成同志又代表朝鲜政府提出了和平解决朝鲜问题的新方案，主张实施朝鲜北部和朝鲜南部的朝鲜联邦制，作为解决朝鲜和平统一问题的过渡办法。朝鲜政府还曾多次提出过加强南北部经济、文化交流等合理的建议。所有这些方案和建议，都获得了全体朝鲜人民的热烈拥护，获得了全世界人民的赞扬和支持；但是，却遭到了美帝国主义及其走狗南朝鲜反动统治者的横蛮拒绝。美国侵略者的真正目的是世人皆知的。这就是要坚持它对南朝鲜的残暴的殖民统治，坚持把朝鲜南半部作为它发动新的侵略战争的前进基地，阴谋在适当的时机重新挑起侵略战争，进攻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，吞并全朝鲜，进而全面破坏世界和平，发起新的世界战争，以实现它独霸全球的梦想。当然，帝国主义者和一切反动派的打算，终究是要落空的。朝鲜问题终究要由朝鲜人民自己来决定，来解决。今年3、4月间，南朝鲜人民掀起的反美、反李承晚的巨大风暴，便是朝鲜人民伟大力量的生动表现。一个曾经是美国重要侵略基地的地区，转眼之间变成了反美的熊熊火山。美帝国主义的占领和奴役，是南朝鲜人民一切痛苦和灾难的来源，朝鲜人民都清楚的认识了这一点。因此，只要美国侵略军队一天不从南朝鲜撤走，美国对南朝鲜的奴役统治一天不结束，朝鲜人民的斗争也就一天不会停止。朝鲜北半部人民的英勇斗争和光辉胜利，给南半部人民以极大的鼓舞，照亮了他们争取解放的道路。以北半部作为民主基地的朝鲜人民革命力量，对反动势力占着压倒的优势。我们在朝鲜参观访问之后，更加坚定了我们一贯的信念：暂时处在美帝国主义和反动派统治下的朝鲜南部人民，必将重返自己祖国的怀抱，朝鲜的三千里锦绣河山，必将完全实现统一。世界上没有什么力量能够阻止朝鲜人民和平统一祖国大业的最终胜利。
    代表团这次在朝鲜的访问，除了看到朝鲜人民在各个战线上取得的光辉成就以外，还十分深切地体会到朝鲜人民具有崇高的无产阶级国际主义精神。代表团的全体同志都有这样的感觉，通过这次访问，我们受到了又一次生动的马克思列宁主义的国际主义教育。朝鲜人民和人民军战友们通过对代表团表现出来的对中国人民和中国人民解放军的真诚友谊，深深地感动了我们。
    在中朝两国人民之间是存在着历史的传统友谊的。近百年来在反抗帝国主义侵略的斗争中，两国人民生死与共、休戚相关。但是，把我们两国人民的友谊引入一个新的历史时期的，是伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利和马克思列宁主义在两国的传播。从这个时候起，两国的劳动人民在战无不胜的马克思列宁主义旗帜下，紧密地团结起来，对共同的敌人帝国主义者进行了共同的斗争。朝鲜人民的优秀儿女们，曾经先后参加了中国第一次、第二次国内革命战争、抗日战争和第三次国内革命战争。以金日成同志为首的朝鲜共产主义者，就曾经长期地同中国人民一起反抗日本帝国主义，对中国人民的抗日斗争，作了伟大的贡献。在长期艰苦的斗争中，许多朝鲜同志英勇地献出了自己的生命。完全可以这样说：染红了我们五星红旗和八一军旗的不仅有中国人民优秀儿女的鲜血，也有朝鲜人民优秀儿女的鲜血。在美帝国主义发动朝鲜战争，霸占我国领土台湾，妄图直接进攻我国的严重时刻，朝鲜人民又以英勇的作战保卫了自己的祖国，同时也保障了我国的安全和和平建设。中国人民志愿军在抗美援朝战争中，更得到了朝鲜人民和人民军的巨大支援和有力配合。应当说，在我们两国相互帮助、相互支援的关系中，朝鲜人民对我们的帮助更早，时间更长。我们对兄弟的朝鲜人民这种崇高的国际主义精神，应当永志不忘。
    从1950年10月中国人民志愿军入朝作战起，到1958年10月志愿军全部从朝鲜撤出为止的八年，是中朝两国友谊史上一段极为重要的时期。在这个期间，两国人民以鲜血凝成的战斗友谊，得到了空前的发展，达到了历史上的高峰。志愿军从朝鲜撤出已经两年了，朝鲜人民对志愿军的怀念不但没有丝毫淡薄，反而愈加深切。我们看到，朝鲜全国为
  “十·二五”十周年举行了隆重的纪念活动。各地纷纷举行了演讲会，座谈会。从10月22日起举行了盛大的中国电影周，各地电影院上演近四十部中国影片。10月25日前后，从平壤市到各个道、市都向志愿军烈士陵园或陵墓献了花圈。我们代表团在平壤同朝鲜党、政领导机关和各界人士、平壤市人民一起，对建立在毛泽东大街一角的“友谊塔”敬献了花圈。我们在前志愿军总部驻地和开城市向志愿军烈士陵园献花圈的时候，看到两个陵园都摆满了当地领导机关和人民群众献的花圈，并且在每一座烈士墓前，都献有一束鲜花。当我们驱车行进在朝鲜田野上的时候，多次看到在苍松翠柏之间，有着用鲜花和花圈围绕的纪念碑，这都是朝鲜人民以纪念自己亲人的心情，献给在朝鲜牺牲的志愿军烈士的。说到这里，我们有责任向所有在抗美援朝战争中牺牲了自己亲人的家属们致意，并且告诉你们：你们亲人的血不是白流的，他们用自己的鲜血浇灌了中朝两国人民之间的友谊花朵。他们不但将得到中国人民而且将得到朝鲜人民永远的纪念。
    中朝两国人民之间的友谊是在人民中间深深地扎了根的。我们看到朝鲜人民对中国人民、对我们伟大的领袖毛主席流露出真心的热爱。我们在许多地方都听到群众和人民军战士们，用中国话齐唱《东方红》，我们在开城会见了志愿军妈妈柳梅同志，她从百多里外跑来，把她们农业小组栽培了六年的一棵最好的人参赠给了代表团。在平壤，我们会见了支前模范石吉荣同志，她在战时为给志愿军挖野菜被敌人炸成了残废；我们还会见了志愿军妈妈李兴凤、朴能秀。在咸兴，我们在群众欢迎行列中，看见了从长津湖畔走了八十公里路前来看望代表团的两位老人。一位是在战争时期为志愿军作向导运炮弹，同志愿军一起作战的洪义铉同志，一位是在火线上救护过志愿军伤员的金培允同志。他们都是年高的老人了，一见到代表团就激动地说：“我们心里想念得很哪！”。他们各自带来了一袋最好的松子送给代表团，借以表达他们的心情。在朝鲜看到的许许多多生动的事实使我们深信，这种建立在马克思列宁主义基础上的、以鲜血凝成的中朝两国之间的友谊，是根深枝茂、万古长青的。是世界上任何力量都不能破坏的。它将像长白山和鸭绿江一样，与世永存。
    目前，在中朝两国人民和军队的双肩上，担负着保卫世界和平，争取各自祖国统一的共同任务。中朝两国人民和全世界人民共同的凶恶敌人美帝国主义，仍然霸占着朝鲜南半部和我们的神圣领土台湾，美帝国主义对我们两国坚持执行侵略政策，积极准备新的战争，不断进行军事挑衅，严重地威胁着我们两国的安全和远东与世界和平。中朝两国人民是热爱和平、反对战争的，两国政府代表人民的意志为争取持久和平，为实现不同社会制度国家之间的和平共处，作了始终一贯的坚持不懈的努力；今后仍将为维护世界持久和平、争取不同社会制度国家和平共处而坚决斗争。但是，我们从同帝国主义者进行长期斗争中得出了一条经验：和平不是可以乞求得来的。朝鲜停战的实现不是仅仅由于谈判斗争的成功，而是首先由于朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军坚决抵抗了美帝国主义的侵略，在战场上打败了敌人。敌人是在无可奈何的情况下，不得不在停战协定上签字认输的。停战以来，美帝国主义者处心积虑地破坏停战协定，非法地把原子武器等新型武器运进朝鲜南部，把南朝鲜的军队扩大为停战时的两倍。从停战后到今年9月底止，仅被正式提出讨论的美国方面违反停战协定的事件，就有九百一十五起。只是由于中朝两国人民为维护停战协定坚持了严肃的斗争，对敌人保持了高度的警惕，由于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量空前强大，由于全世界人民的反对，同时，也还由于朝鲜中立国监察委员会多年来做了有意义的努力，美帝国主义者才至今未敢全面撕毁停战协定，朝鲜的停战局面才能够维持下来。美帝国主义者并未从侵朝战争的失败中得到必要的教训。帝国主义侵略者的豺狼本性是不可能改变的。面对着对于中朝两国人民抱有刻骨仇恨而又武装到了牙齿的美帝国主义，我们决不能够丝毫放松警惕。我们代表团在朝鲜同兄弟的朝鲜人民和人民军战友交谈中，双方时常提到这样的话：如果美帝国主义胆敢再来侵犯我们，为了我们的共同安全、为了世界和平，我们两国人民一定会再一次携起手来，并肩作战，直到把进犯的敌人全部、干净、彻底地消灭掉。我们相信，这是我们两国人民的共同的决心。我们正处在东风压倒西风的伟大时代。当前世界形势的特点是社会主义力量进一步超过帝国主义力量，民族解放力量进一步超过殖民主义力量，人民力量进一步超过反动力量，和平力量进一步超过帝国主义战争力量。目前的国际形势同1950年美国发动侵朝战争时期相比，是更加有利于我们了。我们的力量变得日益强大，我们敌人的力量则变得日趋衰弱。十年前，美帝国主义者还在原子武器方面占着优势，它的纸老虎面目尚未被世人彻底看清，但是这时它就被中朝两国人民打得头破血流；十年后的今天，美国在新式武器方面已远远落后于苏联，它的纸老虎面目已被彻底戳穿，如果它胆敢再来进攻我们，毫无疑问，必将被打得粉身碎骨而遭到彻底的失败。我们相信，在全世界人民的共同斗争下，美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策是可以被击败的，世界和平是可以得到维护的。中朝两国人民的伟大友谊和团结是无敌的力量，我们一定要不遗余力地不断巩固和发展这种友谊和团结。我们中国人民和军队，不论在什么样的情况下，都一定要同朝鲜人民和军队永远地站在一起，向着我们共同的崇高目标——反对帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平、争取社会主义和共产主义的完全胜利而奋勇前进。
