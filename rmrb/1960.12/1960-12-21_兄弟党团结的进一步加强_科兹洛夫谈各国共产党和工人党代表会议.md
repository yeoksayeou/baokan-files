Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 19th: A meeting of activists from the Moscow City Organization of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was held in the Grand Kremlin Palace on the 19th. The meeting discussed the results of the Representatives Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of Various Countries held in Moscow.

Comrade Kozlov, Member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU and Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, delivered a report at the meeting.

The meeting was attended by Aristov, Polyansky, Shvernik, Pospelov, and Mazurov.

In his report, Kozlov analyzed the documents adopted by the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries in Moscow.

Kozlov pointed out the outstanding significance of the declaration and the Appeal to the People of the World adopted by the Representatives Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries. He emphasized that the meeting attached great importance to the further strengthening of the unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries.

Kozlov said that the Moscow meeting played an outstanding role in creatively developing Marxist-Leninist theory, in formulating a consensus position of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries on the most important issues of the present, and in determining the tasks of the international communist and workers' movement.

Kozlov said that the meeting also attached great importance to the most pressing issue of our time - the issue of war and peace.

A large part of Kozlov's report dealt with the question of completing the Soviet Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965) ahead of schedule. He pointed out that the more rapidly the Soviet Union's economic construction advances, the stronger the entire socialist camp will become economically and politically.

Kozlov said that this will enable the world socialist system to exert a greater influence on solving the urgent tasks facing the working people of all countries in the struggle against the attempts of the imperialists to launch a new war and in the struggle for the complete elimination of colonialism.

    参加会议的有：阿里斯托夫、波利扬斯基、什维尔尼克、波斯别洛夫和马祖罗夫。
    科兹洛夫在报告中分析了各国共产党和工人党代表在莫斯科所通过的文件。
    科兹洛夫指出了各国共产党和工人党代表会议通过的声明和告世界人民书的卓越意义。他强调说，会议极其重视各国共产党和工人党团结一致的进一步加强。
    科兹洛夫说，莫斯科会议在创造性地发展马克思列宁主义理论、在制定各国共产党和工人党对当前最重要的问题的一致同意的立场，以及在确定国际共产主义运动和工人运动的任务方面起了卓越的作用。
    科兹洛夫说，会议还非常重视我们时代的最迫切的问题——战争和和平的问题。
