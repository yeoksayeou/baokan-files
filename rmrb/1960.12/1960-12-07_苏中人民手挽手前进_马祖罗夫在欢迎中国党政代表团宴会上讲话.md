Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 5th: TASS reports: The following is the full text of the speech by Mazurov, Alternate Member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Byelorussia, at the banquet held by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Byelorussia, the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian Republic, and the Council of Ministers:

    Dear Comrade Liu Shaoqi! Dear comrades and friends from the People's Republic of China! Dear Comrade Brezhnev! Our dear guests!

    Please allow me, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Byellorussia, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian Republic, and the government, to once again express a warm and sincere welcome to you in Minsk, the capital of our republic.

    The visit of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation, headed by Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, to Byelorussia is a prominent event and a vivid expression of the friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples.

    This friendship is cemented by unity on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. This friendship is strengthened by the consistency of our goals in building socialism and communism and in the struggle for world peace.

    Dear comrades! The people of Byelorussia, like all the working people of the Soviet Union, are happy for the great achievements made by the great Chinese people in all aspects of socialist construction under the leadership of their Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong.

    We are pleased and delighted to see that, thanks to the socialist revolution, China is rapidly transforming from a backward semi-colonial country of the past into a powerful socialist country with modern industry, highly developed agriculture, and advanced science and culture. We praise the glorious cause and achievements of the great, hardworking, and intelligent Chinese people in socialist construction. The Soviet people and the working people of Byelorussia have warm friendship for the heroic Chinese people and hope that they will achieve new successes in socialist construction.

    The Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party and its Central Committee headed by Comrade Khrushchev, are actively and victoriously building a communist society. Across the vast land of the Soviet state, exciting creative labor is seething. The scale of great undertakings and initiatives is also clearly visible on the land of Byelorussia. The people of Byelorussia are fighting shoulder to shoulder with all the peoples of the Soviet Union to complete the magnificent Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

    Now, communism is no longer an ideal, it is becoming a reality in our lives.

    The working people of the Soviet Union are encouraged that the great Chinese people and the people of all countries in the socialist camp are advancing hand in hand with them on the road illuminated by Marxism-Leninism.

    In the peace competition of world historical significance, the strength of socialism is growing day by day, while the forces of capitalism are suffering repeated defeats. The pillar of imperialism—the shameful colonial system—is collapsing. Now, the decisive factor in international development is socialism and the forces of peace. They have the power to stop the imperialists if the latter dare to launch a new war.

    We are advancing along the path pointed out by the great geniuses of mankind, Marx and Lenin. We are deeply convinced of the victory of our common cause and are closely united in one rank. The unbreakable alliance of socialist countries and the solidarity of the international proletariat is the solid foundation for our victory in the struggle for communism.

    Dear comrades, please allow me to propose a toast: To the great Chinese people!

    To the People's Republic of China and its Chairman, Comrade Liu Shaoqi!

    To the glorious Chinese Communist Party and its militant Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong!

    To the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples!

    苏中人民手挽手前进
    马祖罗夫在欢迎中国党政代表团宴会上讲话
    新华社6日讯　塔斯社莫斯科5日讯：苏共中央主席团候补委员、白俄罗斯共产党中央委员会第一书记马祖罗夫在白俄罗斯共产党中央委员会、白俄罗斯共和国最高苏维埃和部长会议举行的宴会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的刘少奇同志！亲爱的中华人民共和国的同志们和朋友们！亲爱的勃列日涅夫同志！我们亲爱的客人们！
    请允许我代表白俄罗斯共产党中央委员会、白俄罗斯共和国最高苏维埃主席团和政府，在我们共和国的首都明斯克，再一次表示热烈和诚恳地欢迎你们。
    我们的中国朋友——以中华人民共和国主席刘少奇同志为首的中国党政代表团对白俄罗斯的访问，是一个突出的事件，是苏联和中国人民之间的友谊的鲜明表现。
    这种友谊是在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的团结所凝结成的。我们在建设社会主义和共产主义、在争取世界和平的斗争中的目的的一致，加强了这一友谊。
    亲爱的同志们！白俄罗斯人民同全体苏联劳动人民一样，为伟大的中国人民在自己的以毛泽东同志为首的共产党的领导下，在社会主义建设的各个方面所取得的巨大成就而感到高兴。
    我们欣然而愉快地看到，由于社会主义革命，中国正在从过去的落后的半殖民地国家急速地变成为具有现代工业、高度发展的农业、先进的科学和文化的强大的社会主义国家。我们赞颂伟大的、勤劳智慧的中国人民在社会主义建设中所进行的光荣事业和取得的成就。苏联人和白俄罗斯劳动人民对英勇的中国人民怀着热烈的友情，并且希望他们在社会主义建设中取得新的成就。
    苏联人民在共产党及其以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的中央委员会的领导下，正在积极地、胜利地建设共产主义社会。在苏维埃国家的广阔的土地上，正沸腾着激动人心的创造性劳动。在白俄罗斯的土地上，也可以明显地看到伟大的事业和创举的规模。白俄罗斯人民同苏联各族人民肩并肩地为提前完成宏伟的七年计划而奋斗。
    现在，共产主义已经不再是理想，它正在成为我们生活中的现实。
    苏联劳动人民感到鼓舞的是，同他们一起在马克思列宁主义照耀的道路上手挽手地前进的，还有伟大的中国人民和社会主义阵营各国人民。
    在具有世界历史意义的和平竞赛中，社会主义力量在一天天壮大，而资本主义力量节节遭到失败。帝国主义的支柱——可耻的殖民主义制度正在崩溃。现在，对国际发展起决定性作用的是社会主义和和平力量。它们有可能制止帝国主义者，如果后者敢于发动新战争的话。
    我们正沿着人类的伟大天才马克思和列宁所指引的道路前进，我们深信我们的共同事业的胜利，并且紧密地团结在一个行列中。社会主义国家牢不可破的联盟和国际无产阶级团结——这是我们在争取共产主义的斗争中取得胜利的牢固基础。
    亲爱的同志们，请允许我提议：为伟大的中国人民干杯！
    为中华人民共和国和它的主席刘少奇同志干杯！
    为光荣的中国共产党及其以毛泽东同志为首的战斗的中央委员会干杯！
    为苏中两国人民永恒的、牢不可破的友谊干杯！
