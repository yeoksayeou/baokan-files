Xinhua News Agency, December 9th: Elisabethville News: About 300 Baluba people's armed forces engaged in fierce fighting on the 7th near Mbirila, south of Kongolo in northern Katanga Province, against the Tshombe reactionary troops who were attempting to prevent their advance. Five soldiers of the Tshombe reactionary troops were killed and four were wounded. It is reported that when this Baluba people's armed force was advancing north towards Kongolo, which is occupied by the Tshombe clique, the Tshombe clique sent a team of reactionary armed forces to block them and opened fire on them. The heroic Baluba people immediately counterattacked with bows and arrows and old-fashioned rifles, severely打击 the Tshombe reactionary troops. On the evening of the 8th, Baluba patriots had already surrounded Kongolo.

    据新华社9日讯　伊利沙伯维尔消息：约三百名巴卢巴人民武装7日在刚果加丹加省北部刚果罗以南的姆比拉附近，同企图阻止他们前进的冲伯反动军队展开激战。冲伯的反动军队有五个士兵被打死，四人被打伤。据报道，当这支巴卢巴人民武装正在北上向冲伯集团盘踞的刚果罗挺进的时候，冲伯集团派了一队反动武装前往阻挡，并向他们开火。英勇的巴卢巴人立即用弓箭和旧式来复枪进行反击，狠狠打击了冲伯反动军队。在8日晚，巴卢巴族爱国者已经包围了刚果罗。
