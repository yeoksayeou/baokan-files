Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 14th: A grand rally of 10,000 people from all walks of life in Hanoi was held tonight at the Hanoi People's Theater, strongly protesting the blatant interference and aggression against Laos by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. The masses at the meeting angrily shouted: "Down with U.S. imperialism," "U.S. imperialism must get out of South Vietnam and Laos," "Resolutely support the Lao people in implementing a policy of peace, neutrality, and national harmony," and "Resolutely support the Lao people's struggle to defend Vientiane."

The rally tonight was jointly presided over by the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, the Hanoi Municipal Committee of the Fatherland Front, the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace, and the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee.

The resolution unanimously adopted by the conference severely condemned the blatant aggression against Laos by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and severely condemned their attack on Vientiane.

The resolution fully agreed with the attitude taken by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in its statement issued on December 14 and in the telegrams sent on December 13 to the Royal Lao Government in Vientiane and to the governments of Southeast Asian countries and the participating countries of the Geneva Conference regarding the Lao situation. The resolution also expressed warm sympathy and support to the Lao people who are fighting against the aggression of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and fighting to defend the path of peace, neutrality, and national harmony in order to build a neutral, independent, unified, and prosperous Laos.

Xuan Thuy, Secretary- General of the Central Committee Vietnam Fatherland Front and member of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Labor Party, spoke at the meeting. He cited irrefutable facts to denounce the consistent interference of U.S. imperialism in Laos. He pointed out that U.S. imperialism is the pillar of world reactionary forces and the deadly enemy of the Vietnamese people, the Lao people, and the people of the world. The challenging behavior of U.S. imperialism has been opposed by the people all over the world. He said that the anti-American struggle of the Lao people is on the rise, and although they will encounter many difficulties, they will eventually win victory.
