    Cadres Go Down to the Fields, More Pigs, More Manure, More Production
    Civil Affairs Brigade Cadres Deepen Ideological Leadership in Pig Farms, Promoting All-Round Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Development
    Juejiao Commune's Tenth Brigade Supports Teams and Members in Raising Pigs, Breeding Volume Grows Rapidly
    Our newspaper Chongqing, December 1st – The Civil Affairs Brigade Party Branch of Shuanghe People's Commune in Chongqing has long adhered to the system of "leading cadres going to pig farms, political work and policies entering pig farms," implementing the method of "using pigs to nourish the fields and using fields to nourish the pigs," resulting in full granaries and pigsties every year, completely changing the face of the poor brigade.
    The main experience of this brigade in pig production is that the Party branch has long adhered to the system of "leading cadres going to pig farms, political work and policies entering pig farms." In implementing this system, all four main cadres of the brigade were assigned to five pig farms, residing there for extended periods. After the cadres arrived at the pig farms, they focused on political work, policy education, and clarifying the relationship between pig production and grain production. At one stage, some members had ideological concerns about vigorously developing the pig-raising industry. They believed that it would be difficult to manage if there were too many pigs, and the issues of pigsties and feed could not be resolved. Some feeders found raising pigs troublesome and preferred to engage in agricultural production. The brigade cadres who went deep into the pig farms, based on the members' ideological understanding, publicized the benefits of raising more pigs and the importance of pig-raising for agricultural production increase. The cadres and members also calculated several accounts related to pig-raising, production, and life together. Through accounting and discussion, every member understood the benefits of raising pigs for the country, the collective, and the individual. The ideological concerns of the members and feeders were eliminated, their enthusiasm was even greater, and a pig-raising upsurge was quickly launched.
    After the number of pigs increased, some people were only willing to feed fattening pigs and were unwilling to feed sows and breeding boars. The brigade cadres residing at each pig farm discovered these thoughts and, based on the instructions of the Party branch, adopted methods such as seminars and heart-to-heart talks to explain the principle of self-breeding and self-raising to the feeders and members. Under the inspiration of the cadres, the members calculated the major benefits of self-breeding and self-raising, clarifying their thoughts through calculation. The principle of self-breeding and self-raising was implemented. Currently, the brigade has 166 sows and 11 boars, and a large number of piglets will be born in December of this year.
    After the brigade cadres went to the pig farms, the political and ideological work of the feeders became systemized and regularized. The brigade cadres often convened meetings of feeders and feed processing and collection personnel, taking the pig farm as a unit, exchanging business experiences on one hand, and doing a good job of political and ideological work on the other. The Party branch of the brigade also carried out activities of small evaluations every half month and comparisons every month among the feeders, selecting outstanding individuals as models for the feeders to learn from. Currently, more than a quarter of the brigade's 40-plus feeders have been rated as advanced producers or red banner bearers in the city, county, district, and commune.
    Because the pigsties of this brigade are rationally distributed according to the land, farmland can obtain fertilizer nearby, greatly saving the labor force for carrying manure, relatively increasing the labor force for agricultural and animal husbandry production. Also, due to sufficient fertilizer, the enthusiasm of all members of the brigade to engage in agriculture and grain production was greatly promoted, and the speed of grain production increase accelerated. Although this year suffered the worst drought in 30 years, due to sufficient fertilizer and water, the brigade's grain production still increased compared to last year. This poor brigade, which achieved a great turnaround by starting with the development of the pig-raising industry, not only does not need state subsidies for grain this year but also completed the task of grain storage ahead of schedule. This year, the brigade sold more than 130 fat pigs to the state, exceeding the purchase task by nearly two times.
    Our newspaper Nanjing, December 1st – The Tenth Production Brigade of Juejiao People's Commune in Rudong County, Jiangsu, has properly solved the problems of piglets and feed, greatly increasing the enthusiasm of the production teams and the majority of members for raising pigs, and the number of live pigs raised has risen rapidly.
    This brigade is a cotton and grain intercropping area. In the past, there was no habit of raising pigs. Before communization, the entire brigade had only more than 80 pigs. After communization, the brigade established a pig farm, using collective pig raising to drive private pig raising by members, thereby promoting further development of live pigs, but the development speed was not fast. In October of this year, the brigade Party branch summarized the rice yield situation of each team this year and found that the yield of the Eighth Team was the highest, increasing by 20% compared to the Ninth and Tenth Teams, which had the same soil quality and water conservancy production conditions. The Party branch mobilized the brigade and team cadres to summarize the production increase experience of this team, and everyone believed that the main point was that due to the rapid development of collective and member individual pig raising, the fertilizer was sufficient, and the paddy fields were applied with two more applications of fertilizer than the average team. Through this summary and discussion by the canteens as units, everyone saw the benefits of implementing the two-pronged approach to pig raising. After achieving ideological consensus, the brigade Party branch arranged feed, piglets, and burning grass for the teams and members raising pigs through the following measures: First, in terms of feed, the brigade distributed the feed grain within the prescribed scope in a timely manner and determined to allocate more than 200 mu of sweet potato vines to the teams and members as winter feed for piglets; Second, in terms of piglets, the brigade uniformly contracted, uniformly ordered, mainly relying on the brigade pig farm for breeding, supplemented by purchasing, to ensure supply to the teams and members; Third, in terms of burning grass, based on past experience, it was determined that raising one pig required 250 catties of burning grass, and it was allocated to the teams and households. For the member's pig manure, democratic evaluation was conducted, the price was determined according to quality, and it was cashed out in a timely manner. At the same time, appropriate regulations were also made on the labor time of the members raising pigs.
    The adoption of the above measures by the brigade has resulted in unprecedented high enthusiasm for raising pigs among the majority of cadres and members, who have proposed guarantees to raise more pigs, immediately launching an upsurge in the development of live pigs. Each team assigned a team leader to strengthen leadership, building pigsties on one hand and mobilizing subsidiary labor on the other, seizing favorable opportunities to engage in green storage feed.
    In this way, the Tenth Production Brigade of Juejiao Commune not only greatly increased collective pig raising, but also developed member individual pig raising. Within a month, collective pig raising in the brigade increased by 20%, pig raising in the production teams increased by five times, and member individual pig raising also increased by more than one time.

    干部下场，猪多肥多增产多
    民政大队干部深入猪场加强思想领导农牧业全都发展
    掘郊公社十大队扶植小队、社员养猪，饲养量增长迅速
    本报重庆1日电　重庆市郊双河人民公社民政大队党支部长期坚持“领导干部到猪场，政治工作和政策进猪场”的制度，实行“以猪养田，以田养猪”的办法，全队年年粮满仓猪满圈，彻底改变了穷队面貌。
    这个队养猪生产的主要经验是党支部长期坚持“领导干部到猪场，政治工作和政策进猪场”的制度。在执行这项制度中，全队四个主要干部分别包干了五个养猪场，长期住在猪场。干部到猪场以后，大抓政治工作、政策教育和摸清楚养猪生产和粮食生产的关系。有一个阶段，部分社员对大发展养猪事业有了思想顾虑，他们认为猪只发展多了不好管理，猪舍、饲料问题解决不了；有的饲养员嫌养猪麻烦，愿搞农业生产。深入猪场的大队干部根据社员的思想认识，向社员宣传了大养其猪的好处和养猪对农业增产的重要作用。干部和社员一起还算了养猪、生产、生活的几笔账。通过算账讨论，社员个个都懂了养猪对国家、对集体和个人的好处。社员和饲养员的思想顾虑消除了，干劲也更足了，迅速掀起了养猪高潮。
    猪只发展以后，部分人又只愿喂养肥猪，不愿喂养母猪和种公猪。住在各猪场的队干部发现这些思想，立即根据党支部的指示，采取座谈会、谈心等方式，向饲养员和社员讲解自繁自养的方针。社员在干部的启发下又算了自繁自养好处的大账，通过算账澄清了思想。自繁自养的方针得到贯彻执行。现在全队有母猪一百六十六只、公猪十一只，今年12月将有大批仔猪降生。
    队干部下猪场以后，饲养员的政治思想工作制度化经常化了。队干部经常以猪场为单位召开饲养员、饲料加工采集员的会议，一面交流业务经验，一面深入做好政治思想工作。队的党支部并在饲养人员中开展半月一小评，一月一评比的活动，选拔优秀分子，作为饲养人员学习的标兵。现在全队四十多名饲养人员中已有四分之一以上被评为市、县、区和公社的先进生产者或红旗手。
    这个队由于猪舍按土地合理分布，耕地能就近取肥，大大节约了挑粪运粪的劳动力，相对地增加了农、牧业生产的劳力。还由于肥料充足，大大促进了全队社员大办农业，大办粮食的干劲，粮食增产的速度加快了。今年虽遭到三十年来没有的大旱，但由于肥足水足全队粮食仍比去年有所增加。从发展养猪事业着手而大翻身的这个穷队，今年不仅不要国家补助粮食，还提前完成公粮入库任务。今年全队卖给国家的肥猪一百三十多头，超过派购任务近两倍。
    本报南京1日电　江苏如东县掘郊人民公社第十生产大队妥善地解决了苗猪、饲料等问题，各生产小队和广大社员养猪积极性大大提高，生猪饲养量迅速上升。
    这个大队是棉粮夹种地区。过去没有养猪习惯，公社化前全大队只有八十多头猪。公社化后，大队办起了养猪场，以集体养猪带动社员私人养猪，从而生猪有了进一步发展，但是发展速度不快。今年10月间，大队党支部总结各小队今年水稻产量情况，发现八小队产量最高，比土质、水利等生产条件相同的九、十小队增产二成。党支部就发动大队和小队干部总结这个小队的增产经验，大家认为：主要的一条，由于集体和社员个人养猪发展得快，肥料足，水稻田比一般队多施了两遍肥。通过这一总结和以食堂为单位的讨论，大家看到了执行两条腿走路养猪的方针的好处。思想取得一致后，大队党支部通过以下几项办法，安排了小队和社员养猪的饲料、苗猪、火草：一，饲料方面，大队按照规定范围内的饲料粮，及时分配下去，并确定将二百多亩山芋藤划给小队、社员作为猪仔的过冬饲料；二，苗猪方面，由大队统一包干，统一订购，以大队养猪场繁殖为主，购买为辅，保证供应小队、社员；三，火草方面，根据过去的经验，确定养一头猪火草二百五十斤，并分配到队、到户。对于社员的猪粪，民主评议，按质论价，及时兑现。同时，还对养猪的社员在劳动时间上作了适当的规定。
    这个大队采取以上措施，广大干部、社员养猪的积极性空前高涨，纷纷提出多养猪的保证，立即掀起了发展生猪的热潮。各小队划出一个队长加强领导，一面建猪舍，一面发动附带劳力，抓住有利时机，搞青贮饲料。
    这样，掘郊公社第十生产大队不仅集体养猪大大增加，社员个人养猪也有了发展。在一个月的时间内，大队集体养猪上升20％，生产小队养猪增加了五倍，社员个人养猪也上升了一倍多。
