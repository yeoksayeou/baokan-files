Grasp the Central Link in Strengthening Team Work
Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company Fully Utilizes the Core Role of Party Groups

(Reported by this newspaper) The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company Party Committee has vigorously strengthened the work of Party groups, enabling each Party group to play a core role in the production teams under the leadership of the Party branch. The strength of each production team has been more fully mobilized, powerfully promoting the in-depth development of the increase production and practice economy movement.

During June and July, the company transferred more than 1,400 cadres to the grassroots level to participate in production, and selected more than 14,000 worker administrators from more than 1,800 production teams to participate in enterprise management. After the work of the teams was strengthened, the production teams not only focused on production, but also on ideology, management, learning, and life, enriching the content of the work. To further leverage the role of the production teams, the company Party committee decided to strengthen the work of the Party groups in an all-round way. The Party committee first summarized and promoted the experience of an advanced Party group on the basic construction site—the "Iron and Steel Assault Team" Party group. Every member of this Party group played an exemplary role, did ideological work, consulted with the masses on everything, and cared for the lives of the masses, enabling the workers of the entire team to maintain full political enthusiasm and production initiative. Over the past three years, this team has overfulfilled its tasks every month and has been rated as an advanced unit of the company every year and every season. After learning from the advanced experience of the "Iron and Steel Assault Team" Party group, each Party group conducted self-examination and summarized their work, creating a surge of learning from and catching up with the "Iron and Steel Assault Team" Party group. The company Party committee also appropriately adjusted the Party groups according to the production organization, so that the Party groups were aligned with the production teams; Party groups that previously had no Party members or weak Party member strength were also appropriately increased and deployed with Party members. The Party committee also held training classes for Party branch members and Party group leaders to further clarify work tasks and methods, and to summarize and exchange work experiences.

After the work of the Party groups was strengthened, ideological and political work at the grassroots production units was significantly strengthened. Under the leadership of the Party branch, each Party group actively conducted ideological and political work within the production team in conjunction with production tasks. Generally, they would carefully analyze the ideological situation of the workers in the group, designate Party members to contact and assist the workers, and carry out ideological and political work in the teams and dormitories, tailoring it to each individual. Zhao Qi, an old worker in the Locomotive Section of the Transportation Department, felt for a period of time that since he had become a seventh-grade riveter and was living well, his political ambition was not so high, and he was not working as hard as before. Party member Li Chonghua visited Zhao Qi's home. At that time, Zhao Qi's family was having dinner, and Li Chonghua started by discussing the issue of eating, talking about the changes in the lives of workers before and after liberation and the responsibilities of the working class. These words greatly stimulated the old worker's class consciousness. Since then, he has actively participated in the increase production and practice economy movement, leading the entire team to overfulfill the locomotive maintenance task.

Under the leadership of the branch, many Party groups actively analyzed production situations, organized competitions, supported the rationalization proposals of the masses, and mobilized the masses to solve problems that arose in production in a timely manner. One night, the coke screening roller belt conveyor of No. 1 blast furnace was buried in coke fines. The Party group immediately held an "on-site meeting" to study solutions; based on the opinions put forward by the Party group, the foreman extracted eight people from positions such as the ditch and hot blast furnace to clean up the coke fines, so that the belt conveyor quickly returned to normal operation, ensuring high production.

Many Party groups often cared for and guided worker administrators in carrying out business activities, so that the various tasks of the group were managed in an orderly manner. The Party group of the hearth bottom bricklaying team in the converter steelmaking workshop promoted worker administrators to regularly issue planned targets before shifts, organize competitions during shifts, and conduct timely evaluations after shifts, so that everyone was clear about production and full of energy. Many Party groups also promoted the trade union to improve the team life meeting system, regularly carried out criticism and self-criticism, promoted workers to actively participate in cultural and technical studies, and promoted workers to improve their ideological and technical levels.

After the work of the Party groups was strengthened, it became the foundation of the work of the Party branches, and the fighting bastion role of the Party branches was more fully exerted. Now, in the production teams, whether it is production, ideology, enterprise management, learning, or life, there is always the specific leadership of the Party. The branch secretaries have freed themselves from some trivial matters and can concentrate on grasping more important tasks such as improving the workers' class consciousness, promoting the production development of the entire workshop, and summarizing and exchanging the work experience of the production teams.

Because this company vigorously strengthened the work of the Party groups, in just over two months, 65% of the Party groups reached the advanced level of the "Iron and Steel Assault Team" Party group. The increase production and practice economy movement has been carried out more vigorously and practically, and the production level of the entire company has steadily increased. The output of pig iron has completed the annual state plan ahead of schedule, and the output of steel in October, November, and the first ten days of December has also completed the plans for that month and that ten-day period, respectively.

For more than two years, they have overfulfilled their production tasks on a monthly and ten-day basis; this year, they completed the annual plan in only one hundred and fifty-six days, becoming a pacesetter among the company's Party groups and a red flag production team.

    抓住加强班组工作的中心环节
    石钢充分发挥党小组的核心作用
    本报讯　石景山钢铁公司党委大力加强党小组工作，使各个党小组在党支部领导下很好地发挥在生产小组中的核心作用。各个生产小组的力量被更充分地调动起来，有力地促进了增产节约运动的深入开展。
    6、7月间，这个公司先后下放了一千四百多名干部到基层参加生产，并在一千八百多个生产小组中选出了一万四千多名工人管理员参加企业管理。班组工作加强以后，生产小组中既抓生产，又抓思想，既抓管理，又抓学习和生活，工作内容更加丰富。为了进一步发挥生产小组的作用，公司党委决定全面加强党小组的工作。党委首先总结、推广了基本建设工地上一个先进党小组——“钢铁突击队”党小组的经验。这个党小组人人起模范作用，人人做思想工作，遇事和群众商量，关心群众生活，使全队工人经常保持饱满的政治热情和生产积极性。三年来，这个小队月月超额完成任务，每年每季都被评为公司的先进单位。各个党小组学习“钢铁突击队”党小组的先进经验以后，纷纷对照检查、总结自己的工作，掀起了一个学、赶“钢铁突击队”党小组的热潮。公司党委还按照生产组织适当调整了党小组，使党小组和生产小组对上“口”；原来没有党员或党员力量薄弱的生产小组，也适当增加和调配了党员。党委还举办了党支部委员和党小组长训练班，进一步明确了工作任务和工作方法，总结交流了工作经验。
    党小组的工作加强以后，基层生产单位的思想政治工作显著加强。各个党小组都在党支部领导下，结合生产任务，在生产小组内积极进行思想政治工作。一般都是认真分析本组工人的思想情况，指定党员分工联系和帮助工人群众，把思想政治工作因人而异地做到班组、宿舍中去。运输部机务段老工人赵起有一段时间认为自己当了七级铆工，光景过得不错，政治进取心不那么高，干活也不如以前劲头足了。党员李崇华便到赵起家访问。当时，赵起一家正在吃饭，李崇华就从吃饭问题谈起，谈了解放前后工人生活的变化和工人阶级的责任。这席话大大激发了这个老工人的阶级觉悟。他从此积极投入增产节约运动，带动全组工人超额完成了机车检修任务。
    许多党小组在支部领导下，主动分析生产情况，组织竞赛，支持群众的合理化建议，发动群众及时解决生产中出现的问题。一号高炉筛焦炭的滚筛皮带机在一天深夜被焦末埋住了。党小组立即在现场举行“战地会议”，研究解决办法；工长根据党小组提的意见，从地沟、热风炉等岗位抽出八个人来清理焦末，使皮带机很快正常运转，保证了高产。
    许多党小组经常关心和指导工人管理员开展业务活动，使小组的各项工作管理得井井有条。转炉炼钢车间砌底板小组的党小组推动工人管理员经常在班前下达计划指标，在班上组织竞赛，在班后及时评比，使人人对生产胸中有数，干劲十足。许多党小组还推动工会健全了小组生活会制度，经常开展批评和自我批评，推动工人积极参加文化和技术学习等，促进工人提高了思想和技术水平。
    党小组的工作加强以后，成了党支部工作的基础，党支部的战斗堡垒作用得到了更充分的发挥。现在，生产小组中无论生产、思想、企业管理、学习和生活，随时随地都有党的具体领导。支部书记们从一些琐细事务中摆脱出来，能够集中精力抓好提高工人的阶级觉悟、促进全车间生产发展和总结、交流生产小组工作经验等比较重大的工作。
    这个公司由于大力加强党小组的工作，在短短的两个多月中，就有65％的党小组达到了“钢铁突击队”党小组的先进水平。增产节约运动开展得更加轰轰烈烈扎扎实实，全公司的生产水平稳定上升。生铁产量已提前完成全年的国家计划，10月、11月和12月上旬钢的产量，也分别完成了当月、当旬的计划。（附图片）
    石钢基建一公司水泥工“钢铁突击队”的党小组，坚持政治挂帅，密切联系群众，使全小队职工紧紧团结在党的周围。两年多来，他们按月、按旬地超额完成生产任务；今年只用了一百五十六天就完成了全年计划，成为这个公司党小组中的标兵和红旗生产小队。图为这个小队的工人正在轧钢厂工地浇灌柱基混凝土。
