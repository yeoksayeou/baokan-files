Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: Guo Moruo, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, led the Chinese Friendship Delegation to Cuba, carrying the deep friendship of China's 650 million people for the heroic Cuban people, and left Beijing by plane this afternoon for Havana.

This delegation is visiting Cuba at the invitation of the Cuban government. The delegation includes people from all walks of life in China. The deputy leader is Xia Yan, Vice Minister of Culture, and the members are Zhao Feng, Zheng Senyu, Cui Tao, Fang Qing, Feng Mailun, and Liu Yuman.

Lin Feng, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Xi Zhongxun, Vice Premier of the State Council, Liao Chengzhi and Bao Erhan, Vice-Chairmen of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, saw them off at the airport today.

Also present at the airport to see them off were: Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese-Latin American Friendship Association, Zhang Su, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Pei Lisheng, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and people from all walks of life in the capital, including Liu Changsheng, Ding Xilin, Wu Han, Liu Qingyang, Xu Guangxiao, Zhou Erfu, Qu Tangliang, and Zhang Chao.

Cuban Ambassador to China, Oscar Pino Santos, also went to the airport today to see them off.

Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: A person in charge of our Ministry of Foreign Trade met with a Xinhua News Agency reporter today and made the following statement on Sino-Cuban trade issues:

(1) The economic and trade relations between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Cuba are developing day by day. Since the beginning of this year, the two governments' trade and economic delegations have visited each other, and the two governments have signed trade and payment agreements, scientific and technical cooperation agreements, and economic cooperation agreements, as well as relevant protocols, which are very beneficial to further developing economic and trade relations between the two countries and enhancing the friendship between the two peoples.

(2) The price of Cuban sugar purchased by China in 1961 is calculated at four cents per pound of Cuban pesos. This price was negotiated by both parties and is considered reasonable.

(3) China's economic and trade exchanges with Cuba are entirely based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. China's purchase of Cuban sugar and other export commodities, as well as the supply of various materials needed for the production and life of the Cuban people, are conducive to developing the economies of the two countries and meeting the production and life needs of the two peoples. Especially at a time when US imperialism is implementing an "embargo" against Cuba, stopping the purchase of Cuban sugar, and attempting to strangle the Cuban economy, it is of even greater significance.

    我外贸部负责人谈中古贸易重要意义
    新华社23日讯　由全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、中国科学院院长、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若率领的中国访问古巴友好代表团，带着中国六亿五千万人民对英雄古巴人民的深厚友谊，今天下午乘飞机离开北京前往哈瓦那。
    这个代表团是应邀到古巴进行友好访问的。代表团的成员包括中国各方面的人士。副团长是文化部副部长夏衍，团员有：赵沨、郑森禹、崔涛、方清、冯迈伦、刘玉满。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长林枫，国务院副总理习仲勋，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席廖承志、包尔汉，今天到机场送行。
    前往机场送行的还有：中国拉丁美洲友好协会会长楚图南，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副秘书长张苏，外交部副部长章汉夫，中国科学院副院长裴丽生，以及首都各方面人士刘长胜、丁西林、吴晗、刘清扬、徐光霄、周而复、区棠亮、张超等。
    古巴驻中国大使奥斯卡·皮诺·桑托斯今天也到机场欢送。
    新华社23日讯　我对外贸易部负责人今天接见新华社记者，就中古贸易问题发表谈话如下：
    （一）中华人民共和国和古巴共和国之间的经济贸易关系正在日益发展。今年以来，两国政府贸易和经济代表团互相访问，两国政府签订了贸易和支付协定、科学和技术合作协定和经济合作协定，以及有关的议定书，对进一步发展两国间的经济贸易关系和增强两国人民之间的友谊是十分有利的。
    （二）1961年中国购买古巴食糖的价格，是按每磅古巴比索四分计算的。这个价格，是经过双方协商并且认为是合理的。
    （三）我国同古巴的经济贸易往来，完全是根据平等互利的原则进行的。中国购买古巴食糖和其他出口商品以及供应古巴人民生产和生活所需要的各项物资，都是有利于发展两国经济和满足两国人民生产和生活需要的。特别是在美帝国主义对古巴实施“禁运”，停止购买古巴食糖，企图扼杀古巴经济的时候，更具有重要意义。（附图片）
