    Persisting Behind Enemy Lines in Huaibei for a Year
    Rao Zijian
    At the end of 1946, after our army annihilated the Kuomintang's 60th Brigade, Pre-3rd Brigade, and Pre-4th Brigade in the Suibei Campaign, and killed the Kuomintang's Commander Dai Zhiqi, we were in the process of reorganization when we received instructions from the Central China Bureau and the Field Army Headquarters: to form the Huaibei Prefectural Committee with me, Wang Xuewu, Zhao Huichuan, Wang Fengwu, Chen Yuanliang, Li Renzhi, Zhang Canming and other comrades as the core leadership. Furthermore, two regiments and one cavalry battalion were to be drawn from the 9th Column to form the Huaibei Advance Detachment, cross the Grand Canal to the west, persist in fighting behind enemy lines, rebuild the Huaibei Liberated Area, and contain the enemy's focused offensive against the Shandong Liberated Area.
    The Huaibei Liberated Area included the vast area bordering Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, north of the Huai River, south of the Longhai Railway, east of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, and west of the Grand Canal, with a population of over three million. It was the old base area created by the original Fourth Division of the New Fourth Army during the War of Resistance Against Japan. After the Kuomintang launched the civil war in the autumn of 1946, it fell into enemy hands. After the 9th Column withdrew from Huaibei, the broad masses of the people and our families were subjected to all kinds of torture by the landlord home-returning legions, reaching the point of family ruin and death. Therefore, going deep behind enemy lines, rebuilding Huaibei, and containing the enemy's offensive was a glorious and arduous task that fully met the expectations of all commanders and fighters. Everyone put forward the slogans: "We are the sons and soldiers of the people of Huaibei, we must coexist with the people of Huaibei!" "Avenge the fathers and elders of Huaibei!" "Persist in the struggle behind enemy lines in Huaibei to cooperate with the frontal battlefield!" At that time, the organization appointed me as the commander and political commissar of this force.
    After a short period of preparation, on the night of January 18, 1947, amidst heavy snow, we secretly crossed the Grand Canal near Niantou, north of Suqian. Due to the lack of boats, we did not finish crossing that night. The next day, several enemy planes bombed and strafed along the crossing, attempting to obstruct our army's crossing, but before the enemy ground forces could figure out our situation, we had already successfully crossed. We camped and concealed ourselves during the day, and marched day and night in the snow towards Hongze Lake. On the sixth day, we met with more than a hundred cadres who had been persisting in the struggle on the lake. According to the spirit of the instructions from the Central China Bureau, we determined to rely on Hongze Lake to develop towards the land. The policy was: to concentrate our forces to annihilate local bandits and despots, to strike at the enemy's main force when the opportunity was favorable, to develop local armed forces, to mobilize the masses, and to rebuild the political power.
    We set foot on our homeland and met with the fellow villagers of Huaibei, and everyone was extremely excited. However, the enemy's cruelty was shocking, and the people's resentment brought tears to our eyes.
    As soon as we arrived, the landlord home-returning legions were joyfully preparing for the Lunar New Year. They thought that "the world was at peace" and even pasted such red couplets on the doors of their courtyards:
    "Set off three thousand firecrackers to drive away the poor ghosts. This little beast has left me empty-handed for several years;
    Light a few sticks of incense to invite the God of Wealth. From now on, I hope you old man will bless me with hundreds of thousands of coins around my waist."
    They were too proud too early. Just when they were using the chicken, fish, meat, eggs, cakes, and steamed buns they had extorted to worship their ancestors, they did not expect us to descend from the sky. They had no time to pack their belongings and fled one after another.
    The broad masses of the people and the families of military workers and martyrs were brutally slaughtered by the Chiang bandits and home-returning legions, and were forced to live or die. The enemy first forced the families of military workers, village cadres, and staff of mass organizations such as peasants, youth, and women who had not retreated to "renew themselves," and extorted a handling fee of twelve silver dollars from each of them. Then they retroactively calculated accounts with the masses, starting from 1943. More than ten households in Zhang Peizhuang were forced to return more than twenty stones of rent and over 600,000 yuan after the landlord returned to Zhanglou. Xie Wenxiu's family in Qian Xiezu was forced to return more than twenty-eight stones of rent. Li Yuzhu's family in Zhatang was allocated a stone trough of landlord Li Xiangchun during the land reform. After the landlord returned home, he asked Li Xiangchun to carry the stone trough back to him, and he also had to buy firecrackers to set off at the landlord's door to show "apology," and buy a few packs of foreign cigarettes to "plead for mercy." In addition, they also levied money from the masses to buy guns and organize "self-defense forces." The masses had to pull embankments, build blockhouses, repair strongholds, and dig blockade ditches even when they were hungry... Many people were arrested, beaten, and hung up because they could not afford the money. Moreover, they had to pay "rope money" when they tied people up, and "labor money" for beating people. Liao Fangxiang, a tenant farmer from Wuwanzi, once served as a township instructor on our side. After our army retreated, he tried to escape to Huaibei, but was intercepted by the enemy in Shuanggou. The home-returning legion forced him to "renew himself" and said, "This guy is very tough. He will do it again when the New Fourth Army comes back." One midnight, they called him out and asked him:
    "Why don't you renew yourself?"
    "What do I have to renew? It's just working for the Communist Party!" That night, the enemy buried him alive! At that time, his wife was giving birth. The next day, his children could not find him everywhere. Later, they found his belt in the wilderness, cried back home, and his wife wanted to commit suicide with scissors when she heard the news, but was rescued by relatives and neighbors.
    An old man named Wu Jingjun, a military dependent who had fled outside, said to me with tears in his eyes: "My young son was shot by the Kuomintang, and my daughter-in-law was sold by the local bandits. Comrades, when will you be able to fight to Lingbi! I am already over sixty years old. If it weren't for waiting for our Eighth Route Army to redress my grievances, I would have been dead long ago..."
    There is no end to such things. The masses cried to us about their endless grievances. Faced with this reality, we can only fight!
    In Huaibei, the enemies who often fought with us had more than a dozen regiments: Sun Liangcheng's three regiments along the Suqian line, the enemy's 10th Brigade and 61st Brigade along the Siyang line, the Guangxi 58th Division along the Qingyang line in Sixian, plus the security teams of various counties, surrounded us and constantly besieged and pursued us. Relying on Hongze Lake, we played circles with the enemy. In the first few months, we fought almost every day and marched every night, always walking hundreds of miles every night. Some comrades fell asleep while walking. Sometimes, even though it was in the snow, they fell asleep as soon as they stopped. The cadres gave their horses to the sick and carried backpacks for everyone. But the enemy was dragged down even more tired. They dared not march at night and their discipline was corrupt. Every time they passed through a place, they pulled men, looted, raped, and did all kinds of evil. Everything from incense burners and candlesticks to bound feet shoes was looted by them. They only cared about making a fortune by "thousands of taels of gold for every cannon shot," how could they have the courage to fight? So often we walked all night, and they only followed the next day when we were stationed. But they didn't dare to get close and blindly fired cannons and machine guns from a distance, like a group of dogs barking wildly from a distance, but not daring to come up. We used a small number of troops to defend our positions and monitor the enemy, allowing everyone to rest. At dusk, as soon as we attacked, they fled. When we dragged the enemy down, we seized the favorable opportunity and beat him hard.
    That year, Huaibei was hit by floods, and the home-returning legions returned to burn, kill, and loot, making the lives of the masses very difficult. The troops often lacked food and didn't know where the next meal was coming from. At the most difficult time, each person could only eat a few ounces of taro dried in one meal. We went down to Hongze Lake to dig lotus roots, pick snails, and dig wild vegetables to fill our stomachs. When some grain was transported from the Huai-Bao area, we had to save a portion to help the masses. Without financial income, the soldiers' food allowance was not enough to buy two cents of oil and salt every day, and there was no question of subsidies at all. Often, everyone had two miscellaneous flour cakes in their pockets, which they ate when marching and fighting was tense. Once, our Deputy Commander Zhao Huichuan was walking and gnawing on dry food. A soldier asked him, "Isn't it cold?" He said, "It will be hot when it gets in my stomach!"
    Under independent persistence, the troops did not get the opportunity to rest, and personnel could not be replenished. Ammunition and weapons could be solved from combat, but clothes, shoes, and socks were very difficult. The troops did not issue a set of summer clothes for a year. Old fighters changed their cotton clothes to quilted ones, and quilted ones to single ones; new fighters did not have old cotton clothes, some only wore a baggage wrapper in the hot weather, some did not have shoes and wrapped their bandages around their feet, and some even wore long gowns and coats from home, and wore felt nests. When it got hot, the mosquitoes on the edge of Hongze Lake were particularly fierce. The troops could only be issued a piece of gauze to cover their heads, and the bumps on their bodies were connected in pieces. There was really no way, so they had to burn straw to smoke mosquitoes at night. The soldiers joked, "There are many strange things by the Hongze Lake, and you have to make a fire in summer." When moving on land, they were always threatened by the enemy, and they had to keep secrets at night. Some comrades who liked to smoke could only cover their heads with clothes and quilts and lie on the ground to smoke. Although everyone was very nervous, everyone became active as soon as they got on the lake. At night, the lake was like a mirror, shimmering in the moonlight, and dozens of small punts raised their sails and raced in the wind, which was very beautiful. The soldiers laughed and sang: "The wheat is yellow and the willow leaves are green, our main force is launching a big counterattack, annihilating hundreds of thousands of Chiang bandits... We have made meritorious service in persisting behind enemy lines..." When they were hungry, they picked water chestnuts and lotus seeds in the lake to eat, and we sailed more than a hundred miles overnight in this "native warship."
    At dawn on February 19, 1947, just as I and the detachment's directly subordinate organs and the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Regiment followed the 2nd Regiment into a village, we received news that the enemy was encircling us. We immediately transferred and escaped the enemy's encirclement after a day and two nights. On the 22nd, I entered Sinan with some responsible comrades of the prefectural committee and the troops. On March 1, we captured Cuiji, the strongest stronghold in the Sinan area, and the blockhouse was blasted open by Wang Yulong, a Communist Party member of the 5th Company of the 2nd Battalion of the 2nd Regiment. The next day, we besieged it for a day and killed and captured more than 70 enemies. On March 3, the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Regiment and the 2nd Battalion of the 2nd Regiment occupied Bancheng. The enemy abandoned their corpses and fled. In the afternoon of the same day, the main force of the 1st Battalion of the 1st Regiment arrived, and the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Regiment blocked the enemy from Qingyang who came to reinforce in Sunyuan, captured more than 70 people, and seized a machine gun. By the morning of March 5, we annihilated the enemy who came to reinforce – five companies of the Supplementary Second Regiment of the Xuzhou Pacification Public Office and two companies of the Sixian Security Team – at Gaoweizi, killing more than 200 enemies, capturing four heavy machine guns, twenty light machine guns, more than 200 rifles, and more than 30,000 rounds of ammunition. We also captured a five-two infantry gun, which could not be taken away at that time and was sent to Hongze Lake. This battle replenished the weapons and ammunition of the troops, and the morale was even higher. The masses were very excited to see that the local bandits had run away and the Kuomintang army had also been defeated. They organized armed forces and established political power. The local bandits who had not run away bowed their heads to the masses and confessed their guilt, saying that they would "build new ones" for the houses they had demolished in the past. The situation was greatly expanded.
    In May, we opened up the Huai-Bao area. On the night of the 5th, we attacked Jiangba, an important town in Huai-Bao. When we were about to capture it, the situation suddenly changed, and two regiments of enemy troops from Huaiyin came to reinforce. Our army withdrew and transferred before dawn, but the 2nd Company of the 1st Battalion of the 1st Regiment was surrounded in the courtyard because they lost contact. Under the leadership of Battalion Instructor Guo Yiping, Company Commander Chen Jizhong, and Deputy Political Instructor Geng Defang, this company fought bravely with the enemy all day, repelling eight charges from an enemy ten times our size, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. They retreated to the lake embankment at dusk, broke through safely from the reeds, and brought down the wounded.
    By June and July, the struggle became more intense and cruel. In the north was Sun Liangcheng's department, in the northwest was Feng Zhian's department, in the south was the enemy's 58th Division, and in the northeast were the enemy's 60th Brigade and 61st Brigade, as well as some local security teams in Anhui, constantly attacking us. On the night of June 9, the troops waded through the mud for two or thirty miles along Hongze Lake, marched barefoot for more than seventy miles, and jumped out of the enemy's encirclement of Huai-Si. When we arrived at Huchang, west of Wangdamiao, we opened fire with the enemy, crossed the Sui River, which was sixteen feet deep, all night and went east to Dadongjia. The enemy thought we were going back to Hongze Lake again. Who knew that we went west all night. On the morning of the 12th, we arrived at Huitang Ditch, eliminated an enemy township office, and won a victory. The soldiers were not tired. After turning around in the west for a few days, the enemy wanted to encircle Huitang Ditch again. On the afternoon of the 18th, we set off from Liangji, east of Yugou, and arrived at Changxu, north of Sixian, at dawn the next day. Unfortunately, we ran into the enemy's arms. We crossed the Sui River in a hurry, passed Machang and Lita, crossed the Sui River again, and arrived at Mazhaizi in the evening. Just as we were about to camp and cook, the local masses came to tell us that there was an enemy battalion stationed in Chenji. So we went east again. The next morning, we arrived at Zhugang. Just as we were stationed to build fortifications and cook, the enemy from Qingyang arrived again. Regardless of fatigue, the troops bravely attacked and repelled two companies of the enemy's Guangxi 58th Division, killing and wounding more than 30 enemies, capturing more than 10 alive, and seizing four light machine guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition. When the enemy collapsed, they did not even have time to carry the heavy machine gun legs and fled. This time, the troops marched continuously for more than two hundred miles, walked for a day and two nights, and many comrades did not have time to eat. Moreover, they came into contact with the enemy three times during the march. The troops had no complaints. We preserved ourselves, but dragged the enemy down.
    In the arduous struggle, the Central China Bureau and the East China Field Army Headquarters constantly gave us instructions, enabling us to adhere to the correct struggle policy, action policy, and party policy. The continuous victories on the frontal battlefield supported us and encouraged us. Due to the continuous victories on the frontal battlefields, the enemy did not go crazy for long, and the war situation changed. The Liu-Deng army went south, and the East China Field Army went to the outer line to fight. The enemy's formation was greatly disrupted. On August 13, the Northern Jiangsu Corps went south and liberated Yancheng, annihilating more than 6,000 enemies. The counteroffensive situation of our army directly affected Huaibei. At the end of September, our East China Field Army occupied Yongcheng, west of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, directly threatening the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. The sound of artillery could already be faintly heard. The enemies in the Huaibei strongholds withdrew one after another. The local bandits concentrated on defending Sixian and Qingyang and other places. On October 1, we besieged Qingyang and launched an attack at 8:00 pm. The battle ended that night, annihilating eight hundred enemies. The local bandits in the Sidong and Sisu area were wiped out. The masses from all over came to find the local fugitive landlords to avenge, and beat gongs and drums to comfort the troops. The military and civilians were jubilant and very lively. On the 12th, the 3rd Column of the East China Field Army crossed the Tianjin-Pukou Railway to the east and liberated Lingbi. That night, we advanced to Sixian, and all the enemies fled, leaving behind many "relief supplies" from American imperialism – milk powder, biscuits, sweaters, gloves, etc. We distributed them to the masses, but the masses did not want them, saying, "Chiang Kai-shek is selling the country, taking these things to deceive people."
    When the East China Field Army turned to the Ping-Han Railway, Huaibei was once tense again. By November 21, we liberated Sixian city for the second time, and all eight squadrons of the Sixian Security Team were annihilated. All the personnel of the puppet county government were captured, except for Xu Zhiyuan, the puppet county magistrate, who went to Nanjing to attend the puppet "National Congress" under the pretext. From then on, the situation in Huaibei stabilized, the masses were mobilized, fighting landlords, establishing militia, joining the army, supporting the front... and unfolded vigorously. In early 1948, nearly two thousand young people from Sinan, Sisu, and Siyang alone poured into our army.
    The military and civilians of Huaibei persisted in the struggle behind enemy lines for more than a year, going through 649 battles of all sizes, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 11,000 enemies, and finally stood firm under the enemy's siege and pursuit, took root, opened up areas, and strengthened the army. When we crossed the Grand Canal, there were two regiments. More than a year later, in addition to establishing local armed forces in various counties, the main force was formed into an independent brigade of the Jianghuai Military Region. All of this would not have been possible without the leadership of the Party and the support of the broad masses. Recalling this period of history makes me deeply realize how important it is to strengthen the leadership of the Party and to maintain close ties with the masses for the construction of our people's army.

    坚持淮北敌后一年
    饶子健
    1946年底，我军在宿北战役中歼灭了国民党的六十旅、预三旅、预四旅，打死了国民党的军长戴之奇之后，正在休整，接到华中局和野战军司令部的指示：以我和王学武、赵汇川、王烽吾、陈元良、李任之、张灿明等同志组成淮北地委，为领导核心，并由九纵抽两个团、一个骑兵大队组成淮北挺进支队，西渡运河，坚持敌后斗争，重建淮北解放区，并且箝制敌人对山东解放区的重点进攻。
    淮北解放区包括淮河以北、陇海路以南、津浦路以东和运河以西苏皖交界的广大地区，人口有三百余万；是原新四军四师在抗日战争中创造的老根据地。1946年秋，国民党发动内战后，沦入敌手。九纵原是从淮北生长起来的一支部队，基层干部和战士大多数是淮北人。从淮北撤退后，广大的基本群众和我们的家属，遭到地主还乡团的百般摧残，已弄到家破人亡的地步。因而深入敌后，重建淮北，箝制敌人进攻，这一光荣而又艰巨的任务，完全符合全体指战员的期望。大家纷纷提出：“我们是淮北人民的子弟兵，要和淮北人民共生存！”“为淮北父老报仇雪恨！”“坚持淮北敌后斗争，配合正面战场！”的口号。当时组织上任命我为这支部队的司令员兼政治委员。
    经过短期准备之后，我们于1947年元月18日大雪纷飞的夜晚，在宿迁以北的埝头附近偷渡运河。由于船只缺乏，当夜没有渡完。第二天，有几架敌机沿渡口投弹扫射，企图阻挠我军渡河，但当敌人地面部队还没有摸清我们的底细时，我们已经胜利地过来了。白天宿营隐蔽，雪夜兼程向洪泽湖插去。第六天就与湖上坚持斗争的一百多个干部会合了。根据华中局指示精神，我们确定依托洪泽湖向陆地发展，方针是：集中力量歼灭土顽，在有利时机打击敌主力，发展地方武装，发动群众，重建政权。
    我们踏上了故乡故土，会见了淮北的乡亲，大家兴奋的了不得。但敌人的残暴使人触目惊心，群众的怨恨使人听了下泪。
    刚过来，地主还乡团正在兴高彩烈地准备过旧历年，他们以为“天下已太平”，竟在他们的庭院门上贴上这样一类的大红对联：
    “放三千爆竹，把穷鬼轰开，几年来被这小畜生弄的我一双空手；
    点几柱清香，将财神请进，从今后望您老人家保佑俺十万缠腰。”
    他们得意得太早了。正当他们用敲诈勒索来的鸡、鱼、肉、蛋、糕、馍馍在祭祀祖宗的时候，没想到我们从天而降，他们来不及收拾细软，又纷纷逃亡了。
    广大的基本群众和军工烈属被蒋匪还乡团凶残地屠杀，被逼得死活不得。敌人先是强逼我方未撤退的军工家属、乡村干部以及农、青、妇等群众团体的工作人员“自新”，并且向他们每人勒索手续费十二块硬洋。接着是向群众倒算，都从1943年算起，张裴庄有十余户，后张楼地主还乡后倒算要退租二十多石、洋六十余万元。前谢嘴谢文秀一家被倒算要退租二十八石多。闸塘李玉琢家在土改中分到地主李祥春的一口石槽，地主还乡后，要李祥春把石槽给他抬回去，还要买鞭炮在地主门口放，表示“赔礼”，买几条洋烟去“讲情”。此外，还向群众派款买枪，组织“自卫队”，群众饿着肚子还得给他们扒圩子，盖炮楼，修据点，挖封锁沟……。许多群众因为出不起钱，就被扒屋，牵牛，端锅，把人押起来吊打，而且绑人时还要“绳头钱”，打人还要“手工钱”。家住吴湾子的佃农廖方香曾任我方乡指导员，我军撤退后，他曾想到淮南逃难，到双沟又被敌人截回来了，还乡团逼他“自新”，并说“这家伙非常硬，新四军回来他还要干的。”一天半夜叫他出来问他：
    “你为什么不自新？”
    “我有什么可自新的？干共产党的事就是了！”当晚敌人就把他活埋了！当时他妻子正在生产，第二天他的孩子四处找不到他，后来在野地发现了他的腰带，哭着回去，妻子一听说就要拿剪刀自尽，被亲邻挽救下来。
    一个逃难在外的军属老汉吴景均眼泪汪汪地对我说：“小儿被顽方枪杀了，儿媳也被土顽卖了。同志们，你们什么时候才能打到灵璧！我已经六十多了，不是为了要等着咱八路军为我伸冤报仇的话，我早就不活了……。”
    这类事情是说不尽的。群众向我们哭诉他们无穷无尽的冤屈。面对着这种现实，我们只有战斗！
    在淮北经常与我作战的敌人有十几个团：宿迁一线有孙良诚部三个团，泗阳一线有敌十旅、六十一旅，泗县青阳一线有桂系五十八师，加上各县的保安队，使我们处于包围之中，不断遭到围困，追击。我们依托洪泽湖，和敌人跳圈子，开始几个月几乎是天天打仗，夜夜行军，每夜总要走百把几十里。有些同志走着路就睡着了，有时虽在雪地里，一停下也睡着了，干部把马给病号骑，替大家驮背包。但敌人被我们拖的更疲劳，他们不敢夜间行军，纪律败坏，每过一地就拉伕，抢劫，奸淫，无恶不作，从香炉烛台到裹脚小鞋，都被他们抢劫一空。他们只顾“大炮一响黄金万两”的发洋财，那有勇气打仗。所以往往我们走了一夜，第二天住下时他们才跟上来。但又不敢接近，远远地在那里盲目地打炮，放机枪，活像一群狗在远远地汪汪乱叫，却又不敢上来。我们用少数部队固守阵地监视着敌人，使大家休息，到黄昏时分，我们一出击他们就逃窜了。当我们把敌人拖垮时，就抓住有利时机，狠狠揍他一顿。
    那年淮北闹水灾，加上还乡团回来烧杀抢掠，群众的生活十分困苦。部队经常缺粮，吃了上顿没有下顿，最困难时每人一顿饭只能吃到几两芋干，下洪泽湖挖藕，拾螺丝，挖野菜充饥，从淮宝区运来点粮食，还要节省一部分救济群众。没有财政收入，战士的菜金每天还不够买二钱油盐，津贴费就根本谈不上了，常常是每人口袋里装两块杂面饼，在行军战斗紧张时吃。一次，我们赵汇川副司令员一边走一边啃干粮，战士问他：“不凉么？”他说：“吃到肚子里就成热的了！”
    在独立坚持的情况下，部队得不到休整的机会，人员得不到补充。弹药武器可以从战斗中解决，但衣服鞋袜却很困难，部队一年没有发一套单衣。老战士把棉衣改成夹的，夹的再改成单的；新战士没有旧棉衣，有的在热天只披一个包袱皮，有的没有鞋子把绑带裹在脚上，甚至穿家里带出来的长袍大褂，戴毡窝的都有。到了热天，洪泽湖边上的蚊子特别厉害，部队每人只能发一块纱布遮头，身上被咬的疙瘩连片，实在没办法，晚上只好烧起谷草熏蚊子。战士们俏皮地说：“洪泽湖边怪事多，夏天还要来烤火。”在陆地上活动时，时刻受到敌人的威胁，夜间又要保守秘密，有些好吸烟的同志也只能用衣服、被子把头盖起来伏在地下吸。大家精神虽很紧张，可是一到湖上大家就活跃起来了。夜里，湖水像明镜一样在月光下闪动，几十只小划子拉起帆来乘风疾驰，非常好看。战士们欢笑唱闹起来了：“麦子发黄柳叶青，我军主力大反攻，消灭蒋匪几十万……敌后坚持咱有功……。”饿了就在湖里拾菱角、摘莲子吃，我们乘着这种“土兵船”一夜划行百余里。
    1947年2月19日拂晓，我和支队直属机关及一团三营随二团刚到一个庄子，便得到敌人合围我们的消息。我们立即转移，走了一天两夜，才突出敌人的包围。22日我与地委部分负责同志带部队进入泗南。3月1日，我们攻克了敌泗南一带最强的据点——崔集，炮楼由二团二营五连共产党员王玉龙同志抱炸药轰开，第二天围困一天，毙俘敌七十余人。一团三营和二团二营3日攻占半城，敌人遗尸狼借逃窜，同日下午，一团主力一营赶到，一团三营又在孙园阻击青阳来援之敌，俘七十余人，获机枪一挺。到3月5日早晨，我们在高圩子又歼灭了来援之敌——徐州绥靖公署补充第二团的五个连和泗县保安队两个连，毙敌二百余人，缴获重机枪四挺，轻机枪二十挺，步枪二百余支，弹药三万余发，而且还缴获了一门五二步兵炮，当时无法带，送到洪泽湖上。这一仗部队武器弹药得到补充，士气更加高涨。群众看到土顽跑了，国民党军队也打了败仗，非常兴奋，纷纷组织武装，建立政权。没有跑掉的土顽向群众低头认罪，过去扒了群众的房屋的说“再给盖新的”，局面大大开展了。
    5月间，我们开辟淮宝地区，5日夜晚攻打淮宝重镇——蒋坝。在快要攻克的时候，因情况突然变化，淮阴之敌有两个团的兵力前来增援。我军于拂晓前撤退转移了，可是一团一营二连因为失掉联络，没有撤出来，被敌人包围在院子里。这个连在营教导员郭一萍、连长陈继忠、副政指耿德芳的率领下，与敌奋战终日，打退了十倍于我之敌的八次冲锋，予敌很大杀伤，黄昏退到湖堤上，由芦苇丛中安全突围了，并且把伤员都带下来了。
    到6、7月间，斗争更加紧张、残酷，北边有孙良诚部，西北边有冯治安部，南边有敌五十八师，东北有敌六十旅和六十一旅，还有些安徽的地方保安团队，不断向我围攻。6月9日夜，部队沿洪泽湖跋涉了二、三十里稀泥，赤脚行军七十多里，跳出敌人对淮泗的合围。到了王大庙以西的胡场，与敌开火，连夜又渡过水深丈六的濉河一直往东，到了大董家。敌人以为我们又要回洪泽湖了，谁知我们连夜又一直向西，12日拂晓到了浍汤沟，消灭了敌人一个乡公所，打了胜仗，战士也不疲劳了。在西边转了几天之后，敌人又要合击浍汤沟。我们于18日下午由鱼沟以东的梁集出发，第二天拂晓到泗县以北的苌圩，不巧正碰到敌人怀里，连忙过濉河，经马厂、里塔，又过濉河，傍晚到马宅子。正想宿营做饭，当地群众来向我们说陈集住有敌人一个营，于是我们就又往东走，第二天早晨到达朱岗，刚驻下筑工事、做饭，青阳的敌人又赶到了。部队不顾疲劳，奋勇出击，击退了敌桂系五十八师两个连，毙伤敌三十余人，生俘十余名，缴获轻机枪四挺，子弹数千发。敌人溃退时连重机枪腿子都来不及扛就逃跑了。这次部队连续行军二百多里，走了一天两夜，许多同志都没来得及吃饭，而且在行军中三次与敌接触，部队毫无怨言。我们保全了自己，却把敌人拖垮了。
    在艰苦的斗争中，华中局、华东野战军司令部不断给我们指示，使我们坚持了正确的斗争方针、行动方针和党的政策。正面战场不断的胜利支援了我们，鼓舞着我们，由于各正面战场的连续胜利，敌人没有疯狂多久，战局就改观了。刘、邓大军南下了，华东野战军到外线作战了，敌人阵势大乱，8月13日苏北兵团南下解放盐城歼敌六千多人。我军反攻的形势直接影响到淮北。9月底我华东野战军攻占津浦路西的永城一线，直接威胁津浦路，炮声已经隐约可以听见。淮北各据点的敌人纷纷撤走了。土顽则集中固守泗县、青阳等地。10月1日，我们围攻青阳，晚八时发起攻击，当晚结束战斗，歼敌八百来人，泗东、泗宿一带的土顽一下连窝端了。各地群众纷纷来找本地的逃亡地主报仇，并敲锣打鼓慰劳部队，军民欢腾，热闹非常。12日，华东野战军三纵队东越津浦路解放灵璧，当夜我们进逼泗县，敌人全部逃跑了，留下许多美帝国主义的“救济物资”——奶粉、饼干、毛衣、手套等等，我们分给群众，群众都不要，说：“蒋介石卖国，拿这些东西来骗人。”
    华东野战军转向平汉路时，淮北又曾一度紧张。到11月21日，我们二次解放泗县城，敌泗县保安队八个中队全部被歼。伪县政府人员除伪县长许志远托故到南京开伪“国大”之外，全部就擒。从此淮北局势稳定下来，群众发动起来，斗地主，建立民兵，参军，支援前线……轰轰烈烈地展开了。1948年初，仅泗南、泗宿、泗阳三县就有近两千名青年涌入我军。
    淮北军民在敌后坚持斗争一年多，经过大小战斗六百四十九次，毙伤俘敌一万一千余人，终于在敌人围攻、追击之下，站住了脚，扎稳了根，开辟了地区，壮大了军队。我们过运河时两个团，一年多之后，除了建立了各县的地方武装之外，主力部队编成江淮军区一个独立旅。这一切没有党的领导和广大群众的支援是不可能的。回忆这一段历史，使我深刻地体会到：加强党的领导，密切与群众的联系，对我们人民军队的建设有多么严重的意义。〔中国人民解放军三十年征文稿〕
