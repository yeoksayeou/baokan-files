Dig to the Bottom

Doing work is like rowing a boat. To make the boat move forward quickly, the boatman must stick the pole all the way to the bottom. If you don't stick it to the bottom, but float the pole on the surface of the water, or stop it in the middle, you can't use your strength even if you have it. In this way, the boat cannot move forward quickly; if you encounter headwinds, there is even a danger of moving backward quickly.

The same is true for doing work. If cadres don't go down to the grassroots, it is difficult to understand the situation below. If they go down but not to the bottom, they cannot grasp first-hand materials. In this way, if they lack in-depth understanding of the actual situation, their plans and ideas will be in danger of being divorced from reality. Only by promoting the style of sticking the pole to the bottom can we promote the rapid advancement of work. However, this "bottom" is not the bottom of the water, but the front line of production, the masses, the production team, and the workshop.

To make the boat move forward quickly, it is not enough to just stick the pole to the bottom; it is equally insufficient to just stick it in casually. Here, we must also pay attention to the method of insertion. If the cadre's work style is improved and the pole is stuck all the way into the masses, but the working method is not correct, the desired effect will still not be achieved. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong compared working methods to "bridges." Cadres who go deep into the front line must also study the issue of "bridges" if they want to cross the river.

With both the style of sticking the pole to the bottom and the Marxist-Leninist working method, our work will ride the wind and waves and move forward rapidly. Several short articles published in this column include both work style and working methods. The two are closely linked, and practical work will naturally advance rapidly.

    插到底
    做工作，好比撑船。要叫船快速前进，船工必须把篙一竿子插到底。插不到底，把篙浮在水面上，或停在水中间，有劲也使不上。这样，船非但不能快速前进；碰到逆水行舟，还有快速后退的危险。
    做工作也是一样。干部不插下去，很难了解下情。插而不到底，也不能掌握第一手材料。这样，对实际情况缺乏深知透解，订计划、出主意，就有架空的危险。只有发扬一竿子插到底的作风，才能推动工作快速前进。不过这个底不是水底，是生产第一线，是群众，是生产小队和工作车间。
    要叫船快速前进，篙不插到底固然不行；随便插一下，同样不行。这里，还得讲究个插法。干部作风改进了，一竿子插到群众中去了，但是工作方法不对头，同样收不到应有的效果。所以，毛泽东同志把工作方法比作“桥”。深入第一线的干部要想过河，还必须研究“桥”的问题。
    既有一竿子插到底的作风，又掌握了马克思列宁主义的工作方法，我们的工作才会乘风破浪，快速前进。这个专栏里刊登的几篇小文章，其中有工作作风，也有工作方法。二者紧密地联系在一起，实际工作自然就会飞速前进了。
