Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou: Fuzhou Power Plant has adopted various measures to ensure the safe operation of equipment and has exceeded the national plan every month this year. As of December 12, the plant's generating units have been operating safely for 332 days. The Fujian Provincial Department of Water and Electricity, Electric Power Bureau, has requested all power plants throughout the province to learn and promote their experience.

The reason why Fuzhou Power Plant can operate safely for a long time is mainly because leaders and workers have firmly established the idea of safe production and have established and improved the safe production system. The Party General Branch Committee of this plant regularly conducts safety ideological education for employees based on different periods, different characteristics, and different targets, and leads employees to carry out safety production inspections, evaluations, and competitions. On the basis of raising the masses' ideological understanding of safe production, the entire plant has universally established a mass safety network, with full-time safety officers from the plant level to the branch workshops and teams, earnestly implementing safe operating procedures to avoid accidents. At the beginning of this year, they focused on revising 18 types of regulations and systems, including the operation procedures for machinery, electricity, and boilers, and the production post responsibility system. At the same time, they adopted various methods such as mutual teaching and learning, contracted teaching and learning, and technical lessons to conscientiously organize the masses to learn, so that safe operating procedures are truly understood and mastered by the masses.

The employees of this factory attach great importance to equipment maintenance and repair work, and adhere to the system of scheduled periodic maintenance, which also effectively avoids various accidents. They often adopt the method of "universal inspection, focusing on key points" to carry out mass safety production inspection campaigns, and immediately study and deal with any equipment defects found. The factory leaders also pay close attention to summarizing the advanced experience of workers in equipment maintenance and repair, and promote the entire safety work. Worker Pan Jinxian has more than ten years of maintenance experience, and the equipment he maintains has never had an accident. The factory leaders summarized his experience of careful inspection, conscientious maintenance, and pre-processing of spare parts using old and waste materials, and widely promoted it among the masses, which achieved good results.

    人人重视安全生产  严格执行操作规程
    福州电厂连续安全运行三百多天
    新华社福州电　福州电厂采取各种措施保证设备安全运行，今年来月月超额完成国家计划。到12月12日止，全厂发电机组已经安全运行三百三十二天。福建省水电厅电业局要求全省各地电厂，学习和推广他们的经验。
    福州电厂能够长期安全运行，主要是由于从领导到工人牢固地树立了安全生产的思想，建立和健全了安全生产制度。这个厂的党总支委员会根据不同时期、不同特点和不同对象，经常向职工进行安全思想教育，并领导职工开展安全生产检查、评比、竞赛。在提高群众对安全生产思想认识的基础上，全厂普遍建立了群众性的安全网，从厂部到分场、班组都设立兼职安全员，认真贯彻安全操作规程，避免事故的发生。今年一开始他们就集中修订了机、电、炉运行操作规程和生产岗位责任制等十八种规程制度，同时采取互教互学、包教包学、上技术课等多种多样的办法，认真组织群众学习，使安全操作规程真正为群众所了解和掌握。
    这个工厂的职工十分重视设备维护、检修工作，坚持按计划定期检修的制度，也有效地避免了各种事故的发生。他们经常采取“普遍检查，主攻关键”的办法，开展群众性的安全生产检查运动，发现设备缺陷立即研究处理。厂领导还十分注意总结工人在维护检修设备方面的先进经验，推动整个安全工作。工人潘锦贤有十多年的维护经验，他所维护的设备从来没有出过事故，厂领导总结了他的慎重细查、认真维修和事先利用旧废料加工备品的经验，在群众中广泛推广，取得了良好的效果。
