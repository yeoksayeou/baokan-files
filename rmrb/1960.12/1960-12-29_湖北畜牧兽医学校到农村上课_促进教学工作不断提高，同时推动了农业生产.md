    Hubei Animal Husbandry and Veterinary School Goes to the Countryside for Classes
    Promoting Continuous Improvement in Teaching and Also Boosting Agricultural Production
    (Our report) Hubei Province's Animal Husbandry and Veterinary School, after moving from the city to the countryside, has fully utilized the vast rural production labor base to carry out teaching, production labor, and scientific research.
    The Hubei Province Animal Husbandry and Veterinary School was originally located in the urban area of Wuhan. In order to deeply implement the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and education combined with productive labor," this school moved to the Jinshui River bank in Wuchang County in the autumn of 1958, a place suitable for the development of animal husbandry production. Teachers and students went deep into the livestock farms and often participated in the farms' production labor. They combined practice with teaching and scientific research activities. At the same time, based on rich production practice, they appropriately increased on-site teaching, achieving learning by doing and combining lectures with practice. The teachers and students of this school also often took the initiative to go to nearby communes and farms to treat livestock diseases and, together with the breeders, improved feeding methods, from which they learned and summarized the experiences of old farmers and breeders, and promptly enriched the teaching and scientific research. Through these activities, the integration of teaching, scientific research, and rural production practice has become even closer. At the same time, with the continuous development of production, teaching work has also been continuously improved and enhanced.
    In the past two years, this school has done a lot of work in serving agriculture, promoting the development of production. This spring, the Jinshui People's Commune experienced a swine fever epidemic. After the school discovered it, it immediately organized teachers and students to treat it, promptly suppressing the spread of the epidemic. The teachers and students also went deep into the communes and livestock farms, identified more than ten superior breeds of pigs, cattle, horses, and sheep, collected 380 kinds of wild feed, trained more than 150 breeders and technicians for nearby communes and farms, and promoted more than 2,000 head of improved breed pigs and more than 400 improved breed chickens.
    Teachers and students who have left the city, lived in the countryside for a long time, and participated in productive labor have undergone profound changes in their thinking and feelings, accelerating the ideological transformation of intellectuals and promoting the laborization of intellectuals. Through two years of frequent labor and practical life with farmers, the vast majority of teachers and students have begun to develop a fine style of loving agricultural production, loving labor, and being diligent and thrifty. Some students, after participating in livestock farm labor, are very concerned about the livestock they have nurtured with their labor and are more passionate about the animal husbandry production industry. More than 200 students who graduated this year have maintained a hard-working, pragmatic, and people-connected work style after going to livestock farms and communes in various counties, and are deeply welcomed by the masses.

    湖北畜牧兽医学校到农村上课
    促进教学工作不断提高，同时推动了农业生产
    本报讯　湖北省畜牧兽医专科学校从城市迁到农村后，充分运用农村广阔的生产劳动基地，开展教学、生产劳动和科学研究。
    湖北省畜牧兽医专科学校原设在武汉市区，为了深入地贯彻党的“教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动结合”的方针，这个学校在1958年秋天迁到了适宜于畜牧业生产发展的武昌县金水河畔，师生们深入到畜牧场里，经常参加场里的生产劳动。结合实际进行教学和科学研究活动。同时，根据丰富的生产实际，适当地增加了现场教学，作到边做边学、讲做结合。这所学校的师生，还经常主动地深入到附近公社、农场为牲畜治病，与饲养员一起改进饲养方法，从中学习和总结老农和饲养员的经验，及时地将它充实到教学、科学研究中去。通过这些活动，使教学、科学研究与农村生产实际结合得更加紧密了。同时，随着生产的不断发展，促使教学工作也不断改进、提高。
    两年来，这个学校在为农业服务方面做了很多工作，推动了生产的发展。今春，金水人民公社一度发生猪瘟现象，学校发现后立即组织师生进行治疗，及时扑灭了瘟病的流行。师生们还深入公社、畜牧场，鉴定了十多种猪、牛、马、羊的优良品种，采集了三百八十种野生饲料，为附近各公社、农场培训了一百五十多名饲养员、技术员，推广了良种猪二千多头和良种鸡四百多只。
    师生走出城市，长期生活在农村，参加生产劳动，思想感情发生了深刻的变化，加速了知识分子的思想改造，促进了知识分子劳动化。通过两年来经常和农民同劳动、同生产的实际生活的锻炼，绝大部分师生开始养成了热爱农业生产、热爱劳动、勤俭朴素的优良作风。有一些学生参加畜牧场劳动后，十分关心自己用劳动培育的牲畜，对畜牧生产事业也更加热爱了。今年毕业的二百多名学生，到各县畜牧场、公社后，一直保持着勤劳朴实、联系群众的工作作风，深受群众欢迎。
