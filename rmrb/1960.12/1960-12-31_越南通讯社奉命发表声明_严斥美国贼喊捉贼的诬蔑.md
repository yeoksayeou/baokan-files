Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 30th: The Vietnam News Agency was ordered on the 29th to publish a statement, sternly refuting the rumors fabricated by US imperialism and its lackeys concerning the so-called interference by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Laos.

The statement said that recently, news agencies of the United States and some of its satellite countries have repeatedly spread rumors, slandering the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for interfering in the internal affairs of Laos and sending paratroopers to Vang Vieng village, north of Vientiane.

The Vietnam News Agency is ordered to declare that the above-mentioned news is a groundless rumor fabricated by US imperialism and its lackeys in an attempt to cover up their ferocious interference in Laos. The slander of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam by US imperialism is merely a tactic of a thief crying "stop thief!"

The statement said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently pursued a policy of peace, based on respect for the Geneva Agreements and the Bandung spirit, and maintains good neighborly relations with the Kingdom of Laos.

The statement refuted a report issued by a Phnom Penh correspondent of the British newspaper *Daily Telegraph* on December 24, which stated that "an official figure in North Vietnam said they could interfere in Laos because they did not want an enemy to exist beside them," saying that this report was completely fabricated.

    越南通讯社奉命发表声明
    严斥美国贼喊捉贼的诬蔑
    新华社河内30日电　越南通讯社29日奉命发表声明，严厉驳斥美帝国主义及其走狗捏造的所谓越南民主共和国干涉老挝的谣言。
    声明说，最近，美国及其一些仆从国家的通讯社曾经多次造谣，诬蔑越南民主共和国干涉老挝内政和派伞兵降落到万象北面的万荣乡。
    越南通讯社奉命声明，上述消息是美帝国主义及其仆从企图掩盖它们对老挝的凶悍干涉而捏造的毫无根据的谣言。美帝国主义对越南民主共和国的诬蔑，只不过是贼喊抓贼者的手法而已。
    声明说，越南民主共和国政府始终如一地在尊重日内瓦协议和万隆会议精神的基础上，奉行着和平政策，并与老挝王国保持着睦邻关系。
    声明对1960年12月24日英国报纸《每日电讯报》驻金边记者发出的一条“北越的一个正式人物曾说他们可以干涉老挝，因为他们不愿意在身边存在着一个敌人”的消息驳斥说，这条消息完全是捏造的。
