    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 23rd: At a mass rally in Port Said on the evening of December 23rd, UAR President Nasser delivered a speech pointing out that "the United Nations has become a tool of imperialism in the Congo. The current tragic situation in the Congo and the arrest of Lumumba and other Congolese nationalists will not affect Africa, nor will it reverse the African nationalist movement. On the contrary, anyone who wants to appeal to the United Nations will know in advance that the United Nations will realize the goals of the United States and the imperialists."

    The mass rally was held to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the victory day when the British, French, and Israeli troops, having failed in their aggression against Egypt, were forced to withdraw from Port Said.

    Nasser said at the rally: "We support the Algerian people and give them all assistance because we believe in freedom and independence. We also cooperate with all countries that oppose French imperialism and condemn the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's efforts to assist France."

    Nasser accused the United States, saying: "In Algeria, the United States provides France with weapons and aid, while the American newspapers express dissatisfaction with the criticism in our newspapers. We want to tell them that this is because the United States has adopted an inappropriate attitude." He said that Israel had received $3 billion from the United States in the past decade.

    Nasser condemned the aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel four years ago, and praised the heroic resistance of the people. He said, "In 1956, Britain and France issued an ultimatum to us. We rejected it, even though we knew that Britain possessed atomic bombs and far superior troops. In the battle against the tripartite aggression, the unity of the people was of greater value than atomic bombs."

    Nasser said that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is the UAR's "number one enemy." He said, "The discord between us and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has become very obvious, and we should be fully prepared for this."

    Nasser reiterated the UAR's foreign policy. He said, "For world peace, we pursue a policy of active neutrality and non-alignment."

    纳赛尔在塞得港群众大会上
    谴责美国支持法国侵阿战争
    指出联合国已成为帝国主义在刚果的工具
    据新华社开罗23日电　阿联总统纳赛尔23日晚上在塞得港举行的一次群众大会上发表演说指出，“联合国已经成为帝国主义在刚果的工具。刚果目前的悲惨境况以及卢蒙巴和其它刚果民族主义者的被捕，决不会使非洲受到影响，也不会使非洲的民族主义运动倒退。相反，任何一个想要求助于联合国的人，都将事先知道，联合国将要实现美国和帝国主义者的目的。”
    这次群众大会是为了纪念英、法和以色列三国军队侵略埃及失败被迫撤出塞得港四周年的胜利日而举行的。
    纳赛尔在大会上说：“我们支持阿尔及利亚人民，并给予他们一切援助，因为我们相信自由和独立。我们还同所有反对法帝国主义的国家进行合作，谴责北大西洋公约组织竭力援助法国”。
    纳赛尔指责美国说：“在阿尔及利亚，美国给法国以武器和援助，而美国的报纸却对我国报纸的抨击表示不满。我们要正告它们，这是因为美国采取不适当的态度的缘故。”他说，以色列在过去十年中从美国得到了三十亿美元。
    纳赛尔谴责了英、法和以色列在四年前对埃及的侵略，赞扬人民的英勇抵抗。他说，“在1956年，英国和法国向我们发出了最后通牒。我们拒绝了它，虽然我们也知道，英国拥有原子弹及优良得多的军队。在对三国侵略的战斗中，人民的团结比原子弹的价值更大。”
    纳赛尔说，北大西洋公约组织是阿联的“头一号敌人”。他说，“我们同北大西洋公约组织之间的不和已经变得十分明显，我们对此应当有充分的戒备。”
    纳赛尔重申阿联的对外政策。他说，“为了世界和平，我们执行积极中立和不结盟政策”。
