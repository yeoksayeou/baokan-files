(Abstract from Local Newspaper Commentary)

    What agriculture needs is what industry should produce. This is an important indicator of how well local industry serves agriculture. The entire process of Dali's organization of small farm tool production illustrates that serving agriculture requires constant observation and understanding of agriculture's needs; only by producing what agriculture needs can we truly promote the development of agricultural production. Currently, in supporting agriculture's technical transformation, some factories have taken on the task of producing agricultural machinery, which is a glorious task. Equipping agriculture with agricultural machinery is the direction of our country's agricultural development, and we must eventually achieve mechanized operations in agricultural production. However, realizing this beautiful plan requires step-by-step progress, which cannot be achieved in a short period of time. While we are organizing forces to produce agricultural machinery and equipment, the main force on the farm tool production front currently, and the one with the greatest demand, remains small farm tools such as hoes and sickles, as well as improved farm tools. Whether these farm tools can meet the needs has a direct impact on current agricultural production. This fact illustrates that county and commune industries should take the active production of small farm tools as one of the important contents of serving agriculture. From Dali's education of its workers and masses on the production of small farm tools, it can also be seen that the important significance of producing small farm tools is not so easily understood by the workers and masses. To make the workers and masses truly understand that serving agricultural production currently should start from reality and from small farm tools, detailed ideological education work is also needed.

    Another important enlightenment from Dali's experience in organizing the production of small farm tools is that although the production technology of small farm tools is simple, producing small farm tools that meet the needs of farmers is a very meticulous task that must be completed with diligence. The quantity of small farm tools needed is large, and there are many specifications. The same kind of farm tool may be easy to use in one area, but not necessarily suitable in another; small farm tools produced for the plains may not be useful in the mountains. And the scope of service of many of our county and commune factories includes different natural conditions such as plains and mountains. Therefore, in the production of small farm tools, to truly meet the needs of each region, it is not a matter of closing the door and producing a batch to solve the problem, but rather it requires a spirit of tireless effort, carefully investigating the needs of farmers in different regions, and producing small farm tools of different specifications according to these needs. The conscientious and pragmatic responsible attitude of the Dali suburban commune farm tool factory in this work is very worthy of promotion.

    In addition to providing a large number of small farm tools to agriculture in terms of quantity, improving the quality of small farm tools is a problem that needs to be solved with equal importance. Farmers often say: "Even the most skilled person needs good tools." Farmers cannot do without small farm tools all year round, and they all hope to have several handy tools at their disposal. To satisfy farmers, it is necessary to put in hard work. Many factories, in the production of agricultural machinery, solicit farmers' opinions in advance, and after the products are produced, they repeatedly ask farmers to try them out for appraisal. This good practice is also needed in the production of small farm tools. Farmers use small farm tools all year round and can offer more practical opinions on how to improve them. In the production of small farm tools, the Dali suburban commune farm tool factory did not abandon this way of improving quality just because the technology of small farm tools was simple. It was precisely by adhering to repeated consultation with farmers that they improved quality and better supported agriculture.

### 重视生产小农具

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    重视生产小农具
    农业需要什么，工业就造什么。这是衡量地方工业为农业服务得好不好的重要标志。大理组织小农具生产的整个过程，都说明了服务农业要随时观察、了解农业的需要，农业要啥，就造啥，才能真正促进农业生产的发展。当前，在支援农业进行技术改造中，一部分工厂担任了生产农业机械的任务，这个任务是光荣的。用农业机械装备农业，这是我们国家发展农业生产的方向，将来一定要在农业生产上实现机械化操作。但是，实现这个美好的计划，需要一步一步地前进，非一朝一夕、一年半载即可实现。在我们一面组织力量生产农业机械装备的同时，当前在农具生产战线上起主要作用的、需要量最大的仍然是锄头、镰刀等类小农具和经过改良的农具。这些农具能否满足需要，对当前的农业生产有直接的影响。这一事实说明了当前县社工业应该把积极生产小农具做为服务农业的重要内容之一。从大理对职工群众进行生产小农具的教育中，也可以看出生产小农具的重要意义，还不是那么容易被职工群众所理解，要使职工群众真正懂得当前为农业生产服务要从实际出发，从小农具入手，还要进行细致的思想教育工作。
    大理组织生产小农具的经验，给人的另一重要启示是，小农具的生产技术虽然简单，但是要生产出合农民心意的小农具，却是一项很细致的工作，必须兢兢业业才能完成这一任务。小农具需要的数量大，规格也多，同样一种农具，在这个地区好用，在另一个地区就不一定适用；为坝区生产的小农具，拿到山区就可能不好用。而我们很多县社工厂所服务的范围，就包括有坝区、山区等不同的自然条件，因此，在生产小农具中，要真正适合每个地区的需要，就不是关起门来生产一批就能解决问题，而是需要有不厌其烦的精神，细致地调查不同地区农民群众的需要，根据这些需要，生产不同规格的小农具。大理郊区公社农具厂在这一工作上认真、求实的负责态度，是很值得提倡的。
    除了从数量上向农业提供大量的小农具外，提高小农具的质量是同时需要重视解决的一个问题。农民常说：人巧还要家什妙。农民一年四季离不开小农具，都希望手边上有几件用起来顺手的农具。让农民用起来满意，就还需要下苦工夫。很多工厂在生产农业机具中，事前征求农民意见，生产出产品后，又反复请农民试用鉴定。这种好的作风，在生产小农具上同样需要。农民常年使用小农具，对如何改进小农具，会提出更切合实际的意见。大理郊区公社农具厂在生产小农具中，没有因为小农具技术简单，就放弃了这一条提高质量的门路，他们正是坚持了反复向农民请教，才提高了质量，更好地支援了农业。
