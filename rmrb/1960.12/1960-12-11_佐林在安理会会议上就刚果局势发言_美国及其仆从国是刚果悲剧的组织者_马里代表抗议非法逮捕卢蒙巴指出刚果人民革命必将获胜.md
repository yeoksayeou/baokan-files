Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 9th. According to TASS: The United Nations Security Council continued its meeting on the afternoon of the 8th to discuss the Soviet Union's proposal to take emergency measures regarding the recent developments in the Congo.

    Zorin, head of the Soviet delegation, stated that the situation in the Congo has recently greatly deteriorated, which is the result of long-term illegal activities with the direct collusion of the UN Secretary-General and the command of the "UN Forces" in the Congo.

    Zorin read out the recent statement of the Soviet government on the situation in the Congo, saying that the colonialists have committed more than one crime against the Congolese people. They are now attempting to physically eliminate the leaders and main national leaders of the Republic of the Congo in order to install mercenaries like Mobutu and Tshombe in their positions. Colonial countries are using all methods, including blatant criminal methods, to try to restore the old order in the Congo and ensure these countries' unlimited rule in the Congo.

    Zorin said that the united front of colonial countries against the Congo is already in action, and their purpose is to strangle this young republic. From the beginning, the United States, together with Belgium, which opposes the Congolese people, opposed the national government of the Republic of the Congo. The United States does this because it has close military and political collusion with Belgium and other colonial countries, and because it loots the Congo and other parts of the world, including Africa, together with Belgium. Zorin said that the United States and its NATO allies are the organizers of the entire tragedy in the Congo. Currently, the US Embassy in Leopoldville is the organizational center for subversive activities against the Republic of the Congo. The US Embassy funds subversive activities and directs this action in the interests of the colonialists.

    Zorin pointed out that Kasavubu and his men, encouraged and condoned by the colonial countries, are increasingly unscrupulously exacerbating relations with African countries that sincerely hope to help the Congolese people in their anti-colonial struggle.

    Zorin then talked about the role of UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld in encouraging the insane Mobutu bandits. Zorin said that Hammarskjöld's speech in the Security Council on the 7th was a call to allow the real transfer of power in the Congo to a group of irresponsible bandits, to allow all democratic foundations there to be trampled upon, and to allow the disbandment of legally established state institutions, and the arrest and torture of leaders of parliament and government.

    Zorin said that Hammarskjöld's speech did not propose any specific measures, which clearly shows that Hammarskjöld does not intend to take any action to improve the current situation in the Congo. Hammarskjöld's actions are only following the will of a group of countries and are undermining the prestige of the United Nations. Zorin finally submitted the Soviet Union's resolution on the situation in the Congo to the Security Council. This resolution firmly condemns the further interference of Belgium and other colonial countries in the internal affairs of the Republic of the Congo and demands that the UN Secretary-General ensure the immediate release of Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba, Senate Speaker Okito, House Speaker Kasongo, and other Congolese ministers and parliamentarians, and take all necessary measures to restore the activities of the legitimate government and parliament of the Republic of the Congo.

    The resolution also requires the "UN forces" in the Congo to immediately disarm the Mobutu terrorist bandits and demands that Belgium immediately withdraw its military and political support personnel from the Congo.

    Zorin stated that the Soviet delegation reserves the right to comment later on the proposals made by the United States, Britain, Italy, and Argentina. He said that the purpose of this proposal is to prevent the Security Council from discussing effective and urgent measures aimed at fundamentally improving the current situation in the Republic of the Congo, but instead to make the Security Council recognize the illegal activities of the Mobutu terrorist group imposed on the Congolese people by the colonialists as legitimate.

    The meeting continued to discuss the Congo issue on the evening of the 8th. Representatives from Britain and those invited to attend the meeting, Mali, Yugoslavia, and Kasavubu, spoke at the meeting.

    Malian representative Mamadou said angrily, "On behalf of the Malian people, I firmly protest the illegal arrest of Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba." He said, "Africa can never forgive this matter. No matter how hard the imperialists try, they cannot turn back the wheel of history. The Congolese people's revolution will be victorious. The people of all African countries stand with the Congolese people."

    The Malian representative exposed the conspiracy of the Western delegations, who attempted to prove that the crimes of the Mobutu bandits were "legitimate." He said that the Congo has a supreme power organ—the parliament and the central government. No legal trickery can justify forcibly dissolving the parliament and arresting its leaders and members.

    The Malian representative expressed indignation at the proposal of the United States, Britain, Italy, and Argentina, because this proposal only paid lip service to ensuring human rights without taking any action. The Malian representative finally demanded the immediate release of Prime Minister Lumumba and all arrested members of the Congolese parliament.

    佐林在安理会会议上就刚果局势发言
    美国及其仆从国是刚果悲剧的组织者
    马里代表抗议非法逮捕卢蒙巴指出刚果人民革命必将获胜
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国安全理事会8日下午继续举行会议，讨论苏联提出的就刚果最近的事态发展采取紧急措施的问题。
    苏联代表团团长佐林发言说，刚果的局势最近大大恶化了，这是在联合国秘书长和在刚果的“联合国军”司令部的直接共谋下长时期的非法活动的结果。
    佐林宣读了苏联政府最近关于刚果局势的声明，他说，殖民主义者对刚果人民已经犯下了不止一次的罪行，它们现在企图从肉体上消灭刚果共和国的领导人和主要的民族领袖，以便把蒙博托和冲伯之流的雇佣分子安置在他们的位子上。殖民主义国家使用一切方法，其中包括明显的犯罪的方法，企图在刚果恢复旧的秩序，保障这些国家在刚果的无限制的统治。
    佐林说，殖民国家反对刚果的联合战线已经在行动，它们的目的是要绞杀这个年青的共和国。美国一开始就同反对刚果人民的比利时一起反对刚果共和国的民族政府。美国这样做是因为它同比利时和其他殖民国家有密切的军事和政治勾结，因为它同比利时一起掠夺刚果以及世界的其他地方，其中包括非洲。佐林说，美国和它的北大西洋盟国是刚果全部悲剧的组织者。目前，驻利奥波德维尔的美国大使馆是反对刚果共和国的颠复活动的组织中心。美国大使馆出钱资助颠复活动并且按照殖民主义者的利益指挥这种行动。
    佐林指出，卡萨武布和他手下的人们，在殖民主义国家的鼓励和纵容下，越发肆无忌惮地加剧同真诚希望帮助刚果人民反殖民主义斗争的非洲国家的关系。
    佐林接着谈到联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德在鼓励疯狂的蒙博托匪徒方面的作用，佐林说，哈马舍尔德7日在安理会的发言，是在号召容许把刚果的政权真正转给一帮不负责任的匪徒，容许那里的一切民主基础遭到蹂躏，容许解散合法建立的国家机构，逮捕和拷打议会和政府的领导人。
    佐林说，哈马舍尔德的发言没有提出任何具体措施，这清楚地表明，哈马舍尔德不打算采取任何行动来改善刚果的目前局势。哈马舍尔德这种行动只是秉承一个国家集团的意旨，是对联合国威信的破坏。佐林最后把苏联就刚果局势的决议案提交安全理事会，这个决议案坚决谴责比利时和其他殖民主义国家对刚果共和国内政的进一步干涉，并且要求联合国秘书长保证立即释放刚果共和国总理卢蒙巴、参议院议长奥基托、众议院议长卡松戈和其他刚果部长和议员，同时采取一切必要的措施，来恢复刚果共和国合法政府和议会的活动。
    决议还要求在刚果的“联合国军”立即解除蒙博托恐怖匪徒的武装和要求比利时立即从刚果撤出军政辅助人员。
    佐林表示，苏联代表团保留以后对美国、英国、意大利和阿根廷提出的提案发表意见的权利，他说，这个提案的目的在于使安全理事会不去讨论目的在根本改善刚果共和国目前局势的有效的和迫切的措施，却想使安全理事会承认殖民主义者强加于刚果人民的蒙博托恐怖集团的非法活动是合法的。
    会议在8日晚间继续讨论刚果问题，英国和应邀列席会议的马里、南斯拉夫和卡萨武布的代表在会上发言。
    马里代表马马杜愤怒地说，我代表马里人民坚决抗议非法逮捕刚果共和国总理卢蒙巴。他说，非洲永远也不能饶恕这件事。无论帝国主义者怎样努力，他们都不能使历史车轮倒转，刚果人民的革命将取得胜利。非洲各国人民站在刚果人民一边。
    马里代表揭露了西方代表团的这一阴谋，它们企图证明蒙博托匪徒的罪行是“合法的”。他说，刚果存在有最高权力机关——议会和中央政府。玩弄任何法律上的诡计都不能认为强行解散议会和逮捕它的领袖和议员是正当的。
    马里代表对美国、英国、意大利和阿根廷的提案表示愤慨，因为这提案只是空谈保障人权，而不作出任何行动。马里代表最后要求立即释放卢蒙巴总理和所有被捕的刚果议会议员。
