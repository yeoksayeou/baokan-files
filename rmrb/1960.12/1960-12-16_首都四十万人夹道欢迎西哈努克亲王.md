    He said, "Due to personal experience, Cambodia recognizes the sincerity and selflessness of China's relations with countries like ours that are determined to love peace, resolutely respect rights and justice, and are committed to better understanding among all peoples."
    Prince Sihanouk said that Cambodian-Chinese cooperation has blossomed and borne fruit. This cooperation will continue to develop in many areas.
