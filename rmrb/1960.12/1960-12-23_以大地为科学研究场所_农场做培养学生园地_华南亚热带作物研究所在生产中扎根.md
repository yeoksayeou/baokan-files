To implement the policy of serving production through scientific research, the South China Subtropical Crops Research Institute moved from Guangzhou to Dan County, Hainan Island—the center of tropical crop production—in 1958. It founded China's first institution of higher learning for training tropical crop technicians, the South China Tropical Crops College, established experimental bases and some pilot plants, and is building a modern demonstration farm, closely integrating research, education, and productive labor to promote each other, which has resulted in significant development.

The South China Subtropical Crops Research Institute is located in Baodao New Village, Dan County, Hainan Island. It is surrounded by state-owned farms and people's communes that mainly cultivate tropical crops. The institute itself also owns land suitable for large-scale development of tropical crops. Rooting in such a production center provides favorable conditions for scientific research to closely connect with production practice and serve production. In the past, when the institute was in Guangzhou, it could only use greenhouses as its main experimental sites and potted seedlings as its primary experimental materials. Coupled with the fact that many researchers disregarded the pressing problems to be solved in production and pursued so-called profound scientific theories, they rarely went deep into the field. As a result, the research work progressed slowly, and even fewer results could be applied to production. After rooting in the production center, with the establishment of experimental bases and demonstration farms, researchers served as production team leaders, often worked alongside workers, and came into contact with tropical crops. This not only increased their production knowledge (which could not be learned from literature) and improved their ability to lead and organize production but also enabled them to discover the needs of production at any time and strengthened their awareness of serving production through scientific research.

Before the relocation of the institute in 1956, only 16.2% of the 37 research projects completed by the entire institute could be used in production. In 1958, after the relocation, 92% of the 50 projects completed could be promoted to production. Last year, the proportion of the 94 projects completed that could be promoted to production increased to 93.6%. In the first half of this year, 60% of the year's research projects were completed ahead of schedule, and the vast majority of them were closely related to production.

The Tropical Crops College, which was founded by the research institute at the same time as it moved to Hainan, also enjoys more advantages than running an agricultural university in the city, as it is located in the production center of tropical crops. The college can frequently organize students to participate in physical labor, professional labor, production practice, and experimental research in state-owned farms and experimental bases, so that students can acquire rich production knowledge and professional knowledge before learning theoretical knowledge. After learning theoretical knowledge, they can immediately test and apply what they have learned in production, so that theory is closely linked to practice. Students are already familiar with the production objects and working conditions they will serve in the future while they are at the college, so they can take on the work assigned to them more quickly and effectively after graduation. At the same time, the researchers of the institute directly or indirectly participate in teaching work, and can pass on the latest research and production results to students as quickly as possible, which greatly improves the quality of teaching. The college also frequently organizes on-site teaching nearby and invites experienced veteran workers and production leaders to give lectures, making the teaching content richer, deeper, and more vivid. Therefore, students' achievements are very good. In the first semester of 1959, the proportion of students with excellent grades was 65%, and in some classes it reached more than 80%. Students' production knowledge is even richer. Many third-year students have not yet taken courses in tropical crop cultivation, but through production practice, they have mastered a series of technologies and knowledge such as sowing, raising seedlings, transplanting, and managing various tropical crops.

The rooting of the research institute and the college in the production base is also of great benefit to promoting the combination of researchers, teachers, students, and workers, carrying out ideological transformation, and accelerating the realization of the intellectualization of laborers. Now, researchers, teachers, and students here have generally developed the habit of labor and a spirit of hard work and simplicity. Many people have established deep feelings with the workers. Whether it is collecting seeds, raising seedlings, or reclaiming wasteland in the wild, they can often be seen working hard like the workers. One researcher described his transformation with these words: "In the past, our people were in Hainan, but our hearts were in Guangzhou; now, no matter where we go, we are thinking of Hainan, of the crops we cultivated with our own hands!"

    以大地为科学研究场所　农场做培养学生园地
    华南亚热带作物研究所在生产中扎根
    本报讯　华南亚热带作物科学研究所为贯彻科学研究为生产服务的方针，于1958年从广州迁到热带作物生产的中心——海南岛儋县。创办了我国第一所培养热带作物技术人才的高等学校——华南热带作物学院，建立了试验基地和一些中间试验工厂，正在兴建一个现代化示范农场，使研究、教育、生产劳动三者密切结合，彼此促进，获得了很大发展。
    华南亚热带作物科学研究所所在的海南岛儋县宝岛新村，周围是以种植热带作物为主的国营农场和人民公社，研究所本身也拥有可以大量发展热带作物的土地。在这样的生产中心扎根，就为科学研究工作密切联系生产实际、为生产服务提供了有利的条件。研究所过去在广州时，只能把温室当作主要试验场所，把盆播苗作为主要试验材料，加上不少研究人员漠视生产中急待解决的问题，追求所谓高深的科学理论，极少深入现场，以致研究工作开展缓慢，能够在生产上应用的更少。扎根在生产中心以后，建立了试验基地和示范农场，研究人员担任生产队长，经常和工人同劳动，和热带作物相接触，不仅增长了在文献上学不到的生产知识，提高了领导生产、组织生产的能力，而且随时能够发现生产的需要，加强了科学研究为生产服务的观念。
    研究所迁所前的1956年，全所完成的三十七个研究项目，可以用于生产上的仅占16.2％；迁所后的1958年，完成了五十个项目，可以推广到生产上的跃为92％；去年完成的九十四个项目，可以推广到生产上去的比例提高到93.6％；今年上半年，提前完成了全年研究项目的60％，绝大部分也都是与生产紧密结合的。
    这个研究所在迁到海南的同时创办的热带作物学院，也由于处于热带作物的生产中心，具有比在城市办农业大学更多的优越性，学院可以经常组织学生到国营农场、试验基地参加体力劳动、专业劳动、生产实习和试验研究，使学生在学习理论知识以前，就获得丰富的生产知识和专业知识；在学习理论知识以后，又可以把所学的马上在生产中检验和应用，使理论密切联系实际。学生在学院时就已经熟悉了今后服务的生产对象和工作条件，毕业以后就能更快更好地负担分配给他们的工作。同时研究所的研究员直接或间接参加了教学工作，能够最快地把研究和生产上最新成果传授给学生，大大提高了教学质量。学院还经常就近组织现场教学和请有丰富生产经验的老工人和生产领导干部讲课，使教学内容更加丰富、深刻和生动。因此，学生的成绩很好。1959年度第一学期成绩优良的学生占65％，有些班级占到80％以上。学生的生产知识更是丰富，许多三年级学生还没有学到热带作物栽培方面的课程，通过生产实践，就掌握了多种热带作物从播种、育苗、定植、管理等一系列的技术和知识。
    研究所、学院在生产基地上扎根，对促进研究人员、教师、学生和工人相结合，进行思想改造，加速实现知识分子劳动化也大有好处。现在，这里的研究人员、教师和学生，普遍养成了劳动的习惯和艰苦朴素的作风，不少人都和工人建立了深厚的感情，不管是采集种子，育苗，在野地上开荒，经常都可以见到他们和工人一样在辛勤劳动。一位研究人员用这样的话描述自己的转变：“过去我们是人在海南，心在广州；现在无论到哪里，惦记着的是海南，是我们亲手栽培的作物！”
