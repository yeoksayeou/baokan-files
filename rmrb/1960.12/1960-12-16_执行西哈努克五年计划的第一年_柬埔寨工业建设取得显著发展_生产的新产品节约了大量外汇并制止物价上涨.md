Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, December 14th: In 1960, the first year of implementing the Sihanouk Five-Year Plan, Cambodia achieved noticeable development in industrial construction.

According to a recent broadcast by Cambodian radio, when Prince Sihanouk spoke to Cambodian students and interns in Paris on November 3rd, he said that the Cambodian government had invested 403 million riels to realize the projects of the first year of the Five-Year Plan. This includes a number of highway and water conservancy construction projects.

He said that the four factories built with Chinese assistance are also part of Cambodia's Five-Year Plan. Two of these factories have been completed, and the plywood and cotton yarn produced are of excellent quality, even better than some imported from France. The other two factories, the paper mill, are nearing completion, and the cement factory is also under construction. He said that in addition to these four factories, the Five-Year Plan also plans to build three other factories, namely a sugar refinery, a jute bag factory, and a tire factory.

He said that the number of Cambodian private industrial enterprises has also increased, with more than 2,000. According to materials published by the weekly "Nationalist," as of August this year, Cambodia had 2,060 private industrial enterprises, an increase of 62 over last year. The total industrial output value was 2.4 billion riels.

Sihanouk also pointed out that in addition to private enterprises and state-owned enterprises such as factories aided by China, Cambodia also has some joint ventures. The capital of these enterprises is invested by the government and private individuals, and is controlled by the government. According to statistics from the Cambodian Ministry of Finance, the Cambodian government has invested 279 million riels in six large joint ventures in the past two years.

Currently, the new products produced in Cambodia have enabled the government to ban the import of commodities such as plywood, cotton yarn, matches, and cigarettes, saving the government a large amount of foreign exchange and curbing price increases.

    执行西哈努克五年计划的第一年
    柬埔寨工业建设取得显著发展
    生产的新产品节约了大量外汇并制止物价上涨
    新华社金边14日电　在1960年，西哈努克五年计划执行的第一年，柬埔寨在工业建设方面取得了明显的发展。
    据柬埔寨电台最近广播，西哈努克亲王11月3日在巴黎向柬埔寨留学生和实习生谈到这个问题时说，柬埔寨政府为了实现五年计划第一年的工程，已经投资四亿零三百万瑞尔。其中包括一些公路和水利建设工程。
    他说，中国帮助建设的四家工厂也是柬埔寨五年计划中的一部分。其中两家工厂已经建成，生产的胶合板和棉纱质量极好，比一些从法国进口的还要好。其他两个厂，造纸厂即将完工，水泥厂也在建造中。他说，除了这四家工厂以外，五年计划还规划建造另外三家工厂，即炼糖厂、麻袋厂和轮胎厂。
    他说，柬埔寨私营工业企业也增加了，为数已有两千多家。据《民族主义者》周刊刊出的材料，到今年8月为止，柬埔寨已有两千零六十家私营工业企业，比去年增加了六十二家。工业总产值为二十四亿瑞尔。
    西哈努克还指出，除了私营企业以及诸如中国援助的工厂等国营企业以外，柬埔寨还有一些合营企业。这些企业的资本是由政府和私人投资的，由政府控制。据柬埔寨财政部统计，柬埔寨政府在最近两年中，已对六家大型合营企业投资了二亿七千九百万瑞尔。
    目前柬埔寨所生产的新产品已使政府可以禁止胶合板、棉纱、火柴、香烟等商品的进口，为政府节约了大量外汇，并制止了物价的上涨。
