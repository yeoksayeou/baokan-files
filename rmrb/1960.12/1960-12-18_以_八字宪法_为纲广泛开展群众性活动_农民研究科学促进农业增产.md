    Broadly Launch Mass Activities Guided by the "Eight-Character Constitution"
    Farmers Study Science to Promote Agricultural Production Increase
    (Our dispatch) Mass scientific and technological research activities in Gansu Province are flourishing in various people's communes. The emergence of the people's communes has not only promoted the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, but also opened up infinitely broad avenues for the development of science and technology.
    At present, most of the more than 500 people's communes in the province have established science and technology committees, science and technology associations, and scientific research groups. The grassroots scientific research organizations of the people's communes, guided by the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, and based on the characteristics of their respective regions, closely integrate with production, have identified some natural laws, and found many effective technical measures. Shanhe People's Commune in Ning County has already written its mass scientific experimentation and research results into 13 types of materials, such as "Investigation Report on Major Cultivation Techniques for Winter Wheat," "Varietal Records," and "Soil Records." These materials have played a great role in promoting production. The scientific research activities of the Yantan People's Commune in Lanzhou have promoted continuous great leaps forward in production. They have successively cultivated lotus roots weighing 20 jin, rapeseed weighing 9 jin, cauliflower weighing 12 jin, cabbage weighing 26 jin, tomatoes weighing 18 jin, and cowpeas measuring 5 chi (approximately 5 feet) and weighing 8 jin. They conducted scientific research according to the "Eight-Character Constitution" combined with the specific conditions of their commune, and applied the research results to production. Therefore, the vegetable production of this commune has achieved a sustained leap forward this year on the basis of the great leap forward in 1959. In the first half of this year, the average per-mu yield of Shangcha vegetables was more than 7,000 jin, an increase of 19.4% over the same period last year. The "Youth Hundred Flowers Scientific Experiment Group" of the Joint Production Team of the Xifeng People's Commune in Qingyang County experimented with 53 varieties introduced from other places in their experimental fields and cultivated 16 improved varieties, which increased production by 5% to 10% or more compared with the control varieties. The Joint Production Team has widely promoted the multi-headed sorghum, sugar beet, and winter wheat varieties that they have successfully tested throughout the team. Last year, the 31 mu of winter wheat planted yielded an average of twice as much per mu as other local wheat. The Zhangjiabao Production Team of the Chengguan Commune in Ning County conducted a lot of research on operations research in order to reasonably arrange the labor force. Last year, they took 12 measures, such as reasonably adjusting the cultivated area, moving the stables to the edge of the village, and changing curved roads to straight roads, achieving linear planning in transportation and rational layout of labor objects, saving a total of more than 12,600 labor days in one year. Five old men from the Songjiayao Production Team of the Shanhe Commune organized a sheep herding research group, summarized ten practical herding experiences, and created an advanced experience of no sheep casualties in two years and seven months and a lambing rate of 100 lambs per 100 ewes, increasing the team's sheep by threefold.
    In the past two years, the scientific research of the people's communes throughout the province has adhered to the leadership of the Party and extensively carried out mass activities, breaking the cold and desolate situation of scientific research only being carried out by a few people in the past. The broad masses of peasants have brought into play the communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, and have created countless miracles. Many ordinary peasants who were illiterate in the past have now become true scientists. Miao Shitong, a member of the Kushui People's Commune in Yongdeng District, Lanzhou City, was a poor peasant in the past. Under the cultivation of the Party, he dared to think boldly and dared to work boldly. After six years of careful cultivation, he finally found a fixed and excellent variety suitable for the local soil and climate conditions. He conducted more than 20 kinds of wheat hybridization experiments and obtained 34 variants, becoming a knowledgeable seedling expert.
    The Party's call to run agriculture and grain production on a large scale by the whole Party and the whole people has put forward even greater tasks for the scientific research work of the people's communes and promoted the further in-depth development of scientific research activities by the people's communes throughout the province. The research work of the grassroots scientific research groups is more active and more closely coordinated with local and current production.

    以“八字宪法”为纲广泛开展群众性活动
    农民研究科学促进农业增产
    本报讯　甘肃省的群众性的科学技术研究活动，正在各人民公社中蓬勃开展。人民公社的出现，不仅促进了工农业大跃进，而且为科学技术的发展开辟了无限广阔的道路。
    目前，全省五百多个人民公社大部分都已建立了科学技术委员会、科学技术协会和科学研究小组。各人民公社的基层科学研究组织，都以农业“八字宪法”为纲，根据本地区的特点，紧密结合生产，摸清了一些自然规律，找到了不少行之有效的技术措施。宁县山河人民公社已经把群众性的科学试验研究成果写成了“冬小麦主要栽培技术考察报告”、“品种志”、“土壤志”等十三种资料。这些材料对促进生产起了很大作用。兰州市雁滩人民公社的科学研究活动，促进生产连年大跃进。他们先后培育出一棵重二十斤的莲花菜、九斤的油菜、十二斤的菜花、二十六斤的包心菜、十八斤的西红柿和五尺长八斤重的豇豆等。他们根据“八字宪法”结合本社的具体条件进行科学研究，并把研究成果用于生产，因此这个公社的蔬菜产量在1959年大跃进的基础上，又获得了今年的持续跃进。今年上半年上槎蔬菜平均亩产七千多斤，比去年同期增长19.4％。庆阳县西峰人民公社联合生产队“青年百花科学试验小组”在自己的试验田里试验外地引进品种五十三个，培育出良种十六个，与对照品种比较都增产了5％至10％以上。联合生产队已把他们试验成功的多头高粱、甜菜、冬小麦品种在全队普遍推广。去年种植的三十一亩冬小麦，平均亩产量比当地其他小麦高两倍。宁县城关公社的张家堡生产队，为了合理安排劳动力，做了许多运筹学方面的研究工作。去年他们采取了合理调整耕作区、马房搬到村边、改弯路为直路等十二条措施，实现了运输上的线性规划和劳动对象的合理布局，一年来共节省了一万二千六百多个劳动力。山河公社宋家崖窑生产队五个老汉组织了一个牧羊研究小组，总结了切实可行的十条放牧经验，创造了两年七个月没伤亡一只羊和百母产百羔的先进经验，使全队羊只增加了三倍。
    两年来，全省人民公社的科学研究由于坚持了党的领导，广泛开展群众性的活动，打破了过去仅限于少数人搞科学的冷冷清清的局面。广大农民群众发挥了敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，创造出了无数的奇迹。许多过去目不识丁的普通农民，今天已成为真正的科学家。兰州市永登区苦水人民公社的社员苗世统，过去是个贫农，在党的培养下，他大胆地想，大胆地干，经过六年的精心培育，终于找到了适合当地土壤、气候条件的定型优良品种。他进行了二十多种小麦杂交的试验，得出三十四个变种，成为一个博学多才的育苗学家。
    党提出的全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的号召，为人民公社的科学研究工作提出更大的任务，促进了全省人民公社进一步深入开展科学研究活动。各基层科学研究小组的研究工作更加活跃，配合当地、当前生产更加紧密。
