Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 1st: Many Soviet factories and enterprises have now completed the guarantees they put forward at the beginning of the year ahead of schedule, producing a large amount of steel, machinery, and other products above plan to support the development of agricultural production.

At the beginning of this year, workers in many steel, machinery manufacturing, power, and other industrial enterprises across the Soviet Union launched a meaningful competition to strive to overfulfill production tasks and use above-plan products to support agriculture. For example, the workers of the "Dinamo" Motor Manufacturing Factory in Moscow took the lead in the motor manufacturing industry by proposing to produce 3,000 electric motors specially for rural use above plan. The Stalingrad Tractor Factory in Stalingrad also proposed to produce 3,000 tractors above plan to support the countryside. In the steel industry, the workers of the Dnepropetrovsk Steel Plant initiated the establishment of a "Steel Fund," guaranteeing to produce a lot of steel above plan specifically for agriculture. The above-mentioned patriotic initiatives of the workers of these factories quickly received responses from many factories and enterprises throughout the Soviet Union.

Now, among the factories and enterprises across the Soviet Union participating in the competition to support agricultural production, many enterprises have completed their competition promises ahead of schedule. The "Dinamo" Motor Manufacturing Factory in Moscow completed the task of supporting agriculture with 3,000 electric motors on November 4th. These above-plan electric motors were all manufactured by the workers using materials saved in production. Now, the workers of this factory have further decided to produce another 100 electric motors for the countryside by the end of the year using saved materials.

The workers of the Beloretsk Steel Plant in the Bashkir Autonomous Republic have also completed their guarantee to support the countryside ahead of schedule. They have produced 150 tons of pig iron, 600 tons of steel, and 750 tons of steel products above plan to promote the mechanization of agricultural production.

In the Ukrainian Republic, the worker Makhotub of the Dnepropetrovsk Steel Plant initiated a proposal at the beginning of this year, calling for the production of steel above plan and the establishment of a "Steel Fund" to support agricultural mechanization with this steel. Now, the Makhotub team has fulfilled their promise ahead of schedule and has produced 500 tons of steel above plan for this "Steel Fund." At present, they are further striving to produce steel that can be used to manufacture 400 tractors for agricultural production above plan by the end of the year. Steelmaking workers Milgorodsky and Trehub of the Dneprodzerzhinsk Steel Plant responded to the competition initiated by Makhotub at the beginning of this year, proposing to produce an additional 1,000 tons and 650 tons of steel, respectively. Now, their guarantees have also been greatly overfulfilled ahead of schedule. Milgorodsky has produced 1,500 tons of steel above plan for agricultural production, and Trehub has produced 840 tons of steel above plan.

The workers of the famous Nizhny Tagil Iron and Steel Combine in the Urals proposed at the beginning of this year to produce 25,000 tons of pig iron, 60,000 tons of steel, and 20,000 tons of steel products above plan for agriculture. Now, the factory has produced 40,000 tons of pig iron, 54,000 tons of steel, and 70,000 tons of steel products.

In Siberia, in addition to producing more than 1,300 tractors above plan for agriculture, the famous Altai Agricultural Machinery Factory has also trained 700 tractor drivers and combine operators for collective farms and state farms since the beginning of this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 1st: According to reports in the local newspapers, the Lenin Steel Plant in Krivoy Rog, Ukrainian Republic, built the world's largest blast furnace on November 29th. This blast furnace has a volume of 2,000 cubic meters and is the first of a series of giant blast furnaces that the Soviet Union plans to build in the next few years.

All production processes of this blast furnace are fully automated and mechanized, and its level of mechanization and automation is among the best in the world. Its blast furnace can heat the blast to 1,200 degrees, which is unattainable by other blast furnaces. Its effective volume utilization coefficient (that is, the effective volume of the blast furnace required to produce one ton of iron per day and night) will reach 0.495 cubic meters, which is also the highest indicator in the world. In order to build this blast furnace, the construction workers completed a huge amount of engineering work. They excavated a total of 280,000 cubic meters of earthwork, installed 80,000 cubic meters of reinforced concrete components, poured 30,000 cubic meters of cement, installed 100,000 tons of metal structures, 140,000 tons of technical equipment, and laid 21 kilometers of railway. All the metal structures of the blast furnace were assembled with large combined components prefabricated in a special factory. This construction method is also unprecedented in the history of blast furnace construction in the world.

Due to the adoption of new installation and welding methods, the 500-ton blast furnace shell was completed in only 22 days (previously, it took two and a half months); the entire blast furnace took only ten months from the start of construction to completion and commissioning. (Photo attached)

    开展劳动竞赛　节约生产材料
    苏联许多工厂用超计划产品支援农业
    克里沃罗格市列宁钢铁厂建成世界最大高炉
    新华社莫斯科1日电　苏联许多工厂企业现在已经提前完成了它们在今年年初提出的保证，超计划生产了大量钢铁、机器和其他产品，以用来支援农业生产的发展。
    今年年初，苏联各地许多钢铁、机器制造、电力等工业企业的职工展开了一项有意义的竞赛，争取大大超额完成生产任务并用超计划生产的产品支援农业。例如莫斯科的“狄纳莫”电机制造工厂的职工在电机制造工业中首先倡议要超计划生产三千台专门适用于农村的电动机，斯大林格勒的斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂也提出要超计划生产三千台拖拉机，以支援农村。在钢铁工业中，第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克钢铁工厂的职工则发起建立“钢铁基金”的倡议，保证要专门为农业超计划生产很多钢铁。这些工厂职工的上述爱国创议，很快得到了苏联各地许多工厂企业的响应。
    现在，苏联各地参加支援农业生产的竞赛的工厂企业中，已经有许多企业提前完成了自己的竞赛诺言。莫斯科“狄纳莫”电机制造工厂，于11月4日完成了支援农业三千台电动机的任务，这些超计划的电动机都是工人们用生产中节省下来的材料制造的。现在，这个工厂的工人还进一步决定到年底再用节省下来的材料为农村生产一百台电动机。
    巴什基尔自治共和国的别洛尔茨基钢铁工厂的职工也提前完成了自己提出的支援农村的保证，他们已经为促进农业生产机械化超计划生产了一百五十吨生铁、六百吨钢、七百五十吨钢材。
    在乌克兰共和国，第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克钢铁工厂的工人马霍图布在今年年初发起倡议，号召超计划生产钢铁，并用这些钢铁建立支援农业机械化的“钢铁基金”。现在，马霍图布小组提前实现了他们的诺言，已经为这一“钢铁基金”超计划生产了五百吨钢铁。目前，他们正进一步争取在年底以前再超计划为农业生产可以制造四百台拖拉机的钢铁。第聂伯罗捷尔任斯基钢铁工厂炼钢工人米尔戈罗德斯基和特列古布在今年年初响应马霍图布发起的竞赛，分别提出要多生产一千吨和六百五十吨钢。现在，他们的保证也大大提前超额完成了。米尔戈罗德斯基已超计划为农业生产了一千五百吨钢，特列古布已超计划生产了八百四十吨钢。
    乌拉尔著名的下塔吉尔钢铁联合工厂的工人在今年年初提出要为农业超计划生产二万五千吨生铁、六万吨钢和二万吨钢材。现在，工厂已经生产了四万吨生铁、五万四千吨钢和七万吨钢材。
    在西伯利亚，著名的阿尔泰农业机器制造厂除了超计划为农业生产了一千三百多台拖拉机外，今年以来还为集体农庄和国营农场培养了七百名拖拉机手和联合机手。
    新华社莫斯科1日电　据此间报纸报道：乌克兰共和国克里沃罗格市的列宁钢铁工厂，在11月29日建成了一座世界上最大的高炉。这座高炉的容积达二千立方米，它是苏联计划在最近几年建设的一系列巨型高炉中的第一座高炉。
    这座高炉的一切生产过程都是充分自动化和机械化的，其机械化和自动化水平在全世界也是首屈一指的。它的鼓风炉可以把鼓风加热到一千二百度。这是其他的高炉所达不到的。它的有效容积利用系数（即每昼夜出铁一吨所需要的高炉有效容积）将可以达到○·四九五立方米，这在全世界也是最高的指标。为了兴建这座高炉，建筑工人们完成了巨大的工程量。他们总共挖掘了二十八万土方，安装了八万立方米的钢筋混凝土构件，浇灌了三万立方米水泥，安装了十万吨金属结构、十四万吨技术设备，敷设了二十一公里的铁路。高炉的所有金属结构都是用预先在专门的工厂制成的大型组合构件装配的。这样的建筑方法在世界高炉建设史上也是前所未有的。
    由于采用了新的安装和焊接方法，五百吨重的高炉外壳只用二十二天就建成了（过去则需要两个半月）；整个高炉从开工建设到建成和投入生产，总共只用了十个月。（附图片）
