Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 10th: The Sixth German Farmers' Congress was held in Rostock on the 8th and 9th. The central slogans of this congress, which was aimed at summarizing the experience since the complete collectivization of agriculture in the German Democratic Republic and mobilizing for agricultural production in 1961, were: "Collective Labor - More Production - Better Life" and "Go All Out for Socialist Progress."

Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Chairman of the State Council of the German Democratic Republic, attended the congress and spoke at the meeting.

Speaking of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries, he said that the meeting made a new estimate of the development of the world.

He said that socialism has proved its strength and its invincibility. All attempts by the ruling classes of imperialist countries to prevent the development of socialism have failed. Imperialism cannot stop the socialist revolution in various countries in Asia and Europe, and it is even less likely to stop the victory of socialism on a worldwide scale. The world socialist system is developing with irresistible force. More and more people are marching towards a happy future on the broad road of socialism.

He also said that today, more and more millions of peasants around the world are forming alliances with the working class in their own countries and cooperating with other progressive strata of their people to fight for social progress, for the abolition of imperialist rule, and for peace, democracy, and socialism.

He then talked about the achievements made by farmers in various socialist countries after embarking on the road of cooperation.

Ulbricht also talked about the main content of the times, war and peace, and the establishment of normal relations between the two Germanys.

Speaking of domestic issues, Ulbricht said that this year, due to the participation of all farmers in agricultural production cooperatives, there has been a further increase in grain yield per hectare, the number of livestock, and commodity production. Collective farmers in more than 19,000 agricultural production cooperatives have successfully demonstrated the superiority of collective labor. He said that in 1960, the worker-peasant alliance in the German Democratic Republic was further consolidated. Thousands of workers, intellectuals, party and state cadres stood with the peasants to support and help them undertake the new tasks of developing and consolidating agricultural production cooperatives and agricultural production.

Ulbricht pointed out that the main task in the future is to consolidate agricultural production cooperatives by consolidating and developing collective labor; to increase production by developing and improving collective labor. 1961 should be a year of good collective labor.

Ulbricht also pointed out the various tasks of agricultural production cooperatives in 1961.

Gerhard Grüneberg, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, made a report at the meeting entitled "Give Play to the Enthusiasm of Male and Female Cooperative Farmers, Solve New Tasks of Socialist Production, and Promote the Development of New Socialist Life in Rural Areas." He said that this year, the average grain yield per hectare reached 27.5 quintals, and potatoes reached 149.9 quintals. The number of large livestock increased by 214,000 heads compared to last year, and pigs increased by 289,000 heads.

He said that in the future, in consolidating Type I cooperatives (primary cooperatives), grasslands should be collectively managed and livestock should be raised by the cooperative. If there are several Type I cooperatives in the same village, it is beneficial to merge them into one cooperative, and the cooperative fund should be guaranteed. Type III cooperatives (advanced cooperatives) should be developed into model cooperatives, increase the cooperative fund, increase the number of livestock, and organize competitions to win the title of "Socialist Labor Team." He also talked about the development of animal husbandry and the full utilization of agricultural machinery and equipment.

Approximately 2,700 representatives attended the congress, and 35 representatives spoke at the meeting. The representatives unanimously passed a resolution at the meeting, ensuring that 1961 would be a year of strengthening collective labor. The resolution emphasized the importance of organizing labor teams in cooperatives and called on each cooperative to formulate plans to overfulfill the production plan for 1961 in a timely manner. The resolution also emphasized the importance of mobilizing women and young people to participate in agricultural production, and called on the agricultural machinery manufacturing industry, the construction industry, the chemical industry, and agricultural scientists to further support the development of agricultural production.

The Minister of Agriculture and Forestry of the German Democratic Republic, Reichelt, made a concluding speech at the meeting.

Before the end of the congress, Ulbricht, on behalf of the State Council, awarded prizes to a number of farmers, agricultural workers, and advanced units who had made remarkable achievements in their work.

This Farmers' Congress had undergone a long period of preparation. In the past month, more than 25,000 various meetings with the participation of 750,000 farmers were held in various places. Many agricultural production cooperatives also greeted the convening of the congress with practical actions in production.

    总结农业合作化经验  迎接明年的生产任务
    德国召开第六次农民代表大会
    乌布利希讲话指出各国共产党和工人党代表会议对世界发展作了新的估计
    新华社柏林10日电　德国第六次农民代表大会于8日和9日在罗斯托克举行。这个为总结德意志民主共和国全部合作化以来的经验和动员进行1961年农业生产的大会的中心口号是：“集体劳动—更多的生产—更好的生活”和“全力为社会主义进步”。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记、德意志民主共和国国务委员会主席乌布利希出席了这次大会，并在会上讲了话。
    他在谈到各国共产党和工人党代表会议时说，这次会议对世界的发展作了新的估计。
    他说，社会主义证明了它的力量和它的不可战胜。帝国主义国家统治阶级的阻止社会主义发展的一切企图都遭到了失败。帝国主义不能阻止亚洲和欧洲各个国家的社会主义革命，它更不可能阻止社会主义在全世界范围内的胜利。世界社会主义体系正在以不可阻挡之势发展着。在社会主义宽阔的道路上越来越多的人民走向幸福的未来。
    他还说，今天在全世界越来越多的成千上万的农民群众同他们本国的工人阶级结成联盟，并与本国人民中其他进步阶层进行合作，共同为争取社会进步，为取消帝国主义的统治，为和平、民主和社会主义而斗争。
    接着他谈到了各社会主义国家农民走上合作化道路后所取得的成就。
    乌布利希还谈到了时代的主要内容、战争与和平以及建立两个德国之间的正常关系问题。
    在谈到国内问题时，乌布利希说，今年由于所有农民参加了农业生产合作社，每公顷谷物产量、牲畜头数和商品生产，都有了进一步的增长，集体农民在一万九千多个农业生产合作社中有成就地发挥了集体劳动的优越性。他说，1960年德意志民主共和国的工农联盟更加巩固了，成千上万的工人、知识分子、党和国家机关干部，站在农民一起支持和帮助农民承担起新的发展和巩固农业生产合作社和农业生产的任务。
    乌布利希指出，今后主要任务是通过巩固地发展集体劳动来巩固农业生产合作社；通过发展和改善集体劳动来提高生产。1961年应该是好的集体劳动的一年。
    乌布利希还指出了农业生产合作社在1961年的各项任务。
    德国统一社会党中央政治局候补委员格吕纳贝格在会上做了题为“发挥男女合作农民的积极性，解决社会主义生产的新任务和促进农村新的社会主义生活的发展”的报告。他说，今年谷物每公顷平均产量达二十七点五公担，马铃薯—一四九点九公担。大牲畜头数比去年增加了二十一万四千头，猪—二十八万九千头。
    他说，今后在巩固一型社（初级社）中应该集体经营草地，社要饲养牲畜。在同一乡村中如有几个一型社时，把它们合为一个合作社是有益处的，合作社基金应该得到保证。三型社（高级社）应该发展成为模范社，增加合作社基金，增加牲畜头数，组织争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的竞赛。他还谈到了发展畜牧业和充分利用农业机器设备问题。
    参加这次大会的，约有二千七百名代表，三十五位代表在会上发了言。代表们在会上一致通过决议，保证把1961年作为加强集体劳动的一年。决议强调了在合作社中组织劳动队的重要性，号召每个合作社及时制定超额完成1961年生产的计划。决议还强调指出了发动妇女和青年参加农业生产的重要性，号召农业机械制造工业、建筑业和化学工业以及农业科学家进一步支持发展农业生产。
    德意志民主共和国农林部长赖歇耳特在会上做了总结发言。
    在大会结束前，乌布利希代表国务委员会向一批工作有显著成就的农民、农业工作者和先进单位发了奖。
    这次农民代表大会曾经过长时间的准备。一个月来，各地先后召开了有七十五万农民参加的二万五千多次各种会议。许多农业生产合作社还在生产上以实际行动迎接了大会的召开。
