Establish a Labor Perspective, Learn Production Skills, and Improve Working Methods
Chongqing's Transferred Cadres Achieve Triple Success in Ideology, Labor, and Work

(Our Report) This year, more than 3,000 cadres from Chongqing Municipality were transferred to rural people's communes to participate in labor training and assist with grassroots work. In the countryside, they actively participated in agricultural labor and conscientiously implemented the Party's policies. They played a significant role in improving work and changing the face of backward and poor teams. At the same time, they themselves achieved a great harvest in ideology and labor.

Over the past ten months, under the care and education of Party organizations at all levels in the city, the transferred cadres earnestly participated in production practice and social practice. Many people, while laboring, actively participated in the work of changing the face of backward and poor teams, received profound class education, and further strengthened their labor perspective. More than 100 cadres from municipal-level organizations transferred to Changshou County averaged more than 100 labor days during their transfer; some cadres even worked more than 200 labor days. The fine qualities of the broad masses of peasants, who listened to the Party, were diligent, simple, hard-working, and pragmatic, greatly educated the transferred cadres. They humbly learned from the peasants and gradually overcame idealistic ideas that exaggerated individual roles.

After the transferred cadres arrived in the countryside, they actively participated in various production battles with full political enthusiasm. In the nationwide movement to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, they were full of vigor and high spirits, and worked together with the broad masses of commune members to make remarkable achievements. The transferred cadres also actively participated in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the countryside, closely focusing on current production and vigorously promoting tool reform. Cadres from municipal-level organizations transferred to the Hongqi Commune in Changshou County, combined with peasants and workers, and successfully trial-produced 28 kinds of agricultural tools such as rice transplanters, sweet potato planters, and rapid harvesters, and helped the commune agricultural machinery factory install some drilling machines, planers, and lathes.

The transferred cadres in the countryside also played the role of both production team members and work team members, actively shouldering the task of changing the face of backward and poor teams. Cadres transferred to various communes in Ba County, under the leadership of the commune Party committee, went deep among the masses and, after clarifying the main problems of the backward teams, repeatedly studied the Party's policies with grassroots cadres, and calculated three accounts: the potential for production, the potential for labor, and the favorable conditions for catching up with advanced teams, which inspired the grassroots cadres' ambition to change the backward situation. The transferred cadres also went deep into the canteens with grassroots cadres to help canteen managers and cooks establish and improve various management systems, and establish vegetable bases. At the same time, under the leadership of the grassroots Party organizations, the transferred cadres also paid attention to helping the team cadres study the rational arrangement of production and labor, earnestly study and implement the Party's policies, strengthen ideological and political work, and help grassroots cadres improve their leadership level. Through this series of work, the enthusiasm of the commune members for production was further mobilized, and a "high work efficiency, high quality" red banner hand competition movement was launched, which rapidly changed the face of production. The masses praised them as "good cadres sent by Chairman Mao" and "as close as our own relatives." The peasants of Changshou County wrote poems praising the transferred cadres: "Transferred cadres come to the peasants' homes, enduring hardship and working hard, implementing the Party's policies well, and praised by every commune member."

Party organizations at all levels paid great attention to the ideological and political education of the transferred cadres. On the one hand, they educated them to earnestly participate in labor training and transform their thinking; on the other hand, they organized them to participate in grassroots work so that they could receive comprehensive training and improvement. In June and October this year, the Municipal Party Committee separately concentrated the cadres from municipal-level organizations transferred to the countryside for training, summarized the achievements and experiences of the transferred cadres in labor training, and clarified the situation, explained the Party's policies and the methods of implementing the policies, and pointed out the direction for future efforts. Party committees at the district and county levels also frequently convened transferred cadres to summarize and exchange experiences, and helped them study the Party's policies. When the Party committees at the district and county levels held enlarged cadre meetings, they also absorbed some transferred cadres to participate, so that they could clarify the direction and tasks. The Party organizations of many communes also established institutions to manage the transferred cadres, help them learn to correctly implement the Party's policies, and gradually learn labor skills; at the same time, they also established democratic life and competition systems, and frequently carried out criticism and self-criticism to help them solve problems in their thinking and work, so that the transferred cadres could advance along the road of being both red and expert.

After ten months of labor training, the transferred cadres loved the countryside even more, and their enthusiasm for labor and work was even higher. They were trained and grew up in the furnace of labor, and many were rated as "five-good" cadres or production red banner hands. Many transferred cadres fell in love with the countryside and personally felt that the countryside needed them. Therefore, they expressed their determination to the Party to be red in the countryside, expert in the countryside, and contribute their wisdom and strength to building a socialist countryside. Recently, the Municipal Party Committee has decided that 300 of them will continue to stay in the countryside and serve as grassroots leadership. (Attached photo)

In September 1960, 31 cadres from the Jiujiang Prefectural Committee and Xingzi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Wuli Commune Party Committee successively went to the Wuli Commune to serve as leaders of production brigades and teams, strengthening the leadership of the agricultural front line. After these cadres arrived at the grassroots level, they actively helped local cadres study the Party's policies, humbly learned agricultural production knowledge from local farmers, and did a good job in mass work.

    树立劳动观点　学会生产本领　改进工作方法
    重庆下放干部思想劳动工作三丰收
    本报讯　重庆市今年有三千多名干部，下放到农村人民公社参加劳动锻炼和协助基层工作。他们在农村，积极参加农业劳动，认真执行党的方针政策，无论在改进工作，改变落后队和穷队的面貌方面，都起了极大作用。同时，他们自己也在思想和劳动等方面，获得了丰收。
    十个多月来，在市的各级党组织的关怀和教育下，下放干部认真参加了生产实践和社会实践。许多人一面劳动，一面积极参加改变落后队和穷队面貌的工作，受到了深刻的阶级教育，进一步加强了劳动观点。市级机关下放到长寿县的一百多个干部，在下放期间，平均每人作了一百多个劳动日；有的干部还作了二百多个劳动日。广大农民听党的话，勤劳朴素，苦干实干的优秀品质，使下放干部受到很大的教育。他们虚心向农民学习，逐渐克服着夸大个人作用的唯心主义思想。
    下放干部到农村以后，以饱满的政治热情，积极参加各项生产战斗。他们在大办农业、大办粮食的全民运动中，意气风发，斗志昂扬，和广大社员一起，作出了显著成绩。下放干部还积极参加农村的技术革新和技术革命运动，紧密围绕当前生产，大搞工具改革。市级机关下放到长寿县红旗公社的干部，和农民、工人结合，试制成功栽秧机、栽苕器和快速收割器等二十八种农具，帮助公社农具厂安装了一部分钻床、刨床和车床。
    下放干部在农村中，还发挥了既是生产队、又是工作队的作用，他们积极担负起改变落后队和穷队面貌的任务。下放到巴县各公社的干部，在公社党委领导下，深入群众，摸清落后队的主要问题后，就和基层干部一起反复学习党的方针政策，算好三笔账：生产潜力账、劳动潜力账和赶上先进队的有利条件账，鼓舞了基层干部改变落后面貌的雄心壮志。下放干部还和基层干部一起深入食堂，帮助食堂管理员和炊事员，建立和健全了各种管理制度，建立起蔬菜基地。同时，下放干部在基层党组织领导下，还注意帮助队的干部研究合理安排生产和劳动力，认真学习和贯彻党的政策，加强思想政治工作，帮助基层干部提高领导水平。通过这一系列工作，进一步调动了社员生产积极性，掀起了“高工效、高质量”的红旗手竞赛运动，迅速改变了生产面貌。群众赞扬他们是“毛主席派来的好干部”，“跟我们的亲人一样”。长寿县的农民写诗称赞下放干部：下放干部到农家，吃苦耐劳干劲大，党的政策实行好，社员个个都夸他。
    各级党组织十分注意对下放干部的思想政治教育。一方面教育他们认真参加劳动锻炼，改造思想；另一方面组织他们参加基层工作，使他们能得到全面的锻炼和提高。市委在今年6月和10月，分别将市级机关下放到农村锻炼的干部集中学习，总结下放干部劳动锻炼的成绩和经验，并且讲清形势，交代党的政策和执行政策的方法，指出今后努力的方向。各区、县委也经常召集下放干部总结交流经验，帮助他们学习党的方针政策。各区、县委举行扩大干部会议时，也吸收部分下放干部参加，使他们明确方向和任务。不少公社的党组织，还成立了管理下放干部的机构，帮助他们学会正确地贯彻党的政策，逐渐学会劳动本领；同时还建立民主生活和评比竞赛等制度，经常开展批评和自我批评，帮助他们解决思想和工作中的问题，使下放干部沿着又红又专的道路前进。
    经过十个月来的劳动锻炼，下放干部对农村更加热爱了，劳动和工作的热情更高了。他们在劳动的熔炉里锻炼成长，许多人被评为“五好”干部或生产红旗手。许多下放干部爱上了农村，切身感到农村需要他们。因此，他们纷纷向党表示决心，要红在农村，专在农村，为建设社会主义的农村献出智慧和力量。最近，市委已经决定，他们当中将有三百名继续留在农村，担任基层领导工作。（附图片）
    1960年9月，中共江西九江地委、星子县委、五里公社党委有三十一名干部先后到五里公社担任生产大队、小队的领导工作，加强了农业第一线的领导。这些干部到达基层后，积极帮助当地干部学习党的方针政策，虚心向当地农民学习农业生产知识，做好群众工作。图为公社党委书记（原来在九江地委宣传部工作）周文（右），和老农周招成（左）交谈当前生产的情形。　新华社记者　喻衍华摄
