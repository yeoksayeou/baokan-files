An article in the Iraqi newspaper "Al-Nasr," written by an observer, recently praised the achievements of our country's construction.

The article stated that the achievements of the Chinese people are attracting attention to an astonishing degree. This is because, during the period from 1949 to 1959, China experienced unprecedented changes that "experts" in the free world dared not believe. The Chinese people have transformed from a colonial nation importing all goods into a liberated nation of laborers producing all goods. The best example of this is the eighty-five-fold increase in steel production in 1959 compared to 1949. If this demonstrates anything, it demonstrates the correctness of the leadership and ideology of the Chinese people, who believe that the people are an inexhaustible source of strength. The article then stated that one of the brilliant achievements of People's China in a very short period is the People's Commune. The People's Commune was established in 1958 and bore fruit in 1960. The article concluded by stating that all these achievements clearly illustrate the great power of the people once they are freed from the shackles of imperialist control and monopoly exploitation.

### 伊拉克《国家报》载文指出  中国的成就证明领导正确

    伊拉克《国家报》载文指出
    中国的成就证明领导正确
    伊拉克《国家报》不久以前发表署名观察家的一篇文章，盛赞我国建设的成就。
    文章说，中国人民所取得的成就引人注意到惊人的程度，这是因为在1949至1959年这一段时间内，中国出现了自由世界的“专家们”不敢相信的空前的变化，中国人民已经从一个进口一切货品的殖民地民族转变成为一个生产一切货品的劳动的解放的民族了。在这方面最好的例子就是1959年的钢产量比1949年增加八十五倍。这如果说明什么的话，这正说明认为人民乃是不竭源泉的中国人民的那种领导和思想的正确性。文章接着说，人民中国在极短的一个时期中所取得的辉煌成就之一就是人民公社。人民公社是在1958年着手建立的，1960年就结出了果实。文章最后说，所有这些成就，给我们明确说明，人民一旦摆脱了帝国主义控制枷锁和垄断剥削就会有多么大的能力。
