    Developing Diversified Operations and Expanding Sources of Raw Materials
    Chengdu Measuring Tool Plant Achieves High Quality, High Yield, and Low Cost
    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 28th. The Chengdu Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Plant comprehensively overfulfilled its annual state plan thirteen days ahead of schedule. As of December 18th, the plant's product output reached 215.3% of the planned target, an increase of 84.2% compared to the same period last year; all variety targets were exceeded, with the number of varieties tripling compared to the same period last year; the product defect rate was reduced by 37% compared to the plan; labor productivity overfulfilled the planned target, an increase of 127.4% compared to the same period last year; and the cost of comparable products was reduced by 18.9% compared to the plan, and 85.1% compared to the same period last year.
    A major characteristic of the plant's comprehensive and early completion of the plan is its vigorous development of diversified operations to ensure the supply of raw materials needed for achieving high output, high quality, and low cost. This year, the Chengdu Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Plant has produced a total of sixty-six major raw materials, including steel, chemicals, and grinding wheels, through diversified operations, of which thirty-five have become more than self-sufficient. Their diversified operations have a clear purpose and focus, and concentrate manpower, so the production of some urgently needed major raw materials has been fully developed. For example, due to the shortage of steel required for production this year, they made expanding steel production the center of diversified operations, concentrating efforts to expand the existing steelmaking satellite factory, increasing the capacity of electric furnace steelmaking, building a new steel rolling workshop, and jointly establishing mines with Longchang County, Xichang Prefecture, and others. In the first eleven months of this year, the plant produced a total of more than 16,000 tons of steel, more than 3,500 tons of steel products, and more than 4,800 tons of pig iron, which strongly guaranteed the needs of a substantial increase in the output of measuring tools and cutting tools.
    This year, the raw material satellite factories run by the plant have all taken it as their primary task to improve product quality, increase the variety of specifications, reduce production costs, and serve as good assistants to the main factory. The grinding wheel factory, which was founded in 1958 by three cadres from the tool storage warehouse and some family members of the workers, has, after the workers' hard work and technical revolution, increased the variety of grinding wheels from fourteen last year to one hundred and forty-five. This year, it manufactured a total of 1.35 million grinding wheels of various types, all of which met quality standards, and the cost was only half of the state allocation price. Now, the plant's needs for various grinding wheels are basically self-sufficient. The small chemical plant, which previously could only produce six products such as potassium nitrate and sodium nitrate, can now produce more than forty products. The improvement in product quality and the increase in the variety and quantity of products from these satellite factories have played a significant role in improving the quality of measuring tools and cutting tools, increasing variety, and reducing costs.

    开展多种经营　扩大原料材料来源
    成都量具厂优质高产成本低
    新华社成都28日电　成都量具刃具厂提前十三天全面超额完成了全年国家计划。到12月18日止，全厂产品产量完成计划215.3％，比去年同期增长84.2％；品种计划全部超额完成，品种数量比去年同期增加三倍；产品废品率比计划降低37％；劳动生产率超额完成计划，比去年同期增长127.4％；可比产品成本比计划降低18.9％，比去年同期降低85.1％。
    大搞多种经营，保证本厂实现高产优质低成本所需要的原料材料，是这个厂全面提前完成计划的主要特点。成都量具刃具厂今年通过多种经营，共生产了钢材、化工、砂轮磨具等六十六种主要原料材料，其中有三十五种已经作到了自给有余。他们多种经营目的明确，重点突出，人力集中，因此急需的一些主要原料材料的生产得到了充分发展。例如，今年全厂生产上所需的钢材不足，他们就把扩大钢铁生产作为多种经营的中心，集中力量扩建了原有的炼钢卫星厂，增加了电炉炼钢的能力，新建了一个轧钢车间，还与隆昌县、西昌专区等合办了一些矿山。今年十一个月内，全厂共生产钢一万六千多吨，钢材三千五百多吨，生铁四千八百多吨，有力地保证了量具刃具产量大幅度增长的需要。
    今年来，这个厂所办的原料材料卫星工厂，都把提高产品质量、增加品种规格、降低生产成本、当好大厂助手，作为自己的主要任务。由工具保管库三个干部和一部分职工家属在1958年创办起来的砂轮厂，今年经过职工们苦钻苦学，进行技术革命，砂轮磨具的品种由去年的十四种增长到一百四十五种，今年共制造出各种砂轮磨具一百三十五万件，全部达到质量标准，成本仅为国家调拨价格的一半。现在全厂所需要的各种砂轮磨具，基本上做到自给自足。小型化工厂过去只能生产硝酸钾、硝酸钠等六种产品，今年也已能生产四十多种产品。这些卫星工厂产品质量的提高，品种数量的增加，对于提高量具刃具的质量、增加品种和降低成本，都起了显著的作用。
