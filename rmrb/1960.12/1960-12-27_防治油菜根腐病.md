    Preventing and Curing Oilseed Rape Root Rot
    After several rains, more than 50 mu of oilseed rape in the Gao Ya Ping Production Team of our commune suddenly had yellowing leaves and stopped growing. Wu Deyi, the Party branch secretary, and agricultural technicians went to the fields to analyze the cause of the disease. Through analysis and research on the disease's development, everyone agreed that it was caused by excessive rainfall, standing water on the ground, high soil moisture, and the ground becoming hardened and compacted when the weather cleared, preventing the soil moisture from evaporating, thus resulting in root rot. After identifying the cause, the production team immediately arranged for labor to repair ditches, drain standing water, and seize the opportunity of sunny days to carry out intertillage and apply topdressing fertilizers such as plant ash to increase soil temperature and reduce humidity. At the same time, they also pulled out severely diseased plants, replanted seedlings, and pruned the stems and leaves of lightly diseased plants. After taking these measures, the development of oilseed rape root rot has stopped. Now, all over 1,000 mu of oilseed rape in the team are growing very well.

    防治油菜根腐病
    下过几次雨以后，我们公社高桠坪生产队有五十多亩油菜忽然叶子发黄，停止生长。党支部书记吴德益就和农业技术员到田间分析病源。通过分析研究发病情况，大家一致认为是由于雨水多，地面有积水，土壤湿度大，天晴时地面被晒得板结，土壤里的水分不能蒸发，因此得了根腐病。病源找出以后，生产队立即安排劳力修整沟渠，排出积水，并抓紧晴天时间进行中耕，施了草木灰等追肥，增加了地温，减轻了湿度，同时还拔掉了病害严重植株，补上了苗，剪掉了病害较轻植株上的茎叶。采取这些措施以后，油菜根腐病已停止发展。现在全队一千多亩油菜长得都很好。
