Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 11th: According to reports in the newspapers here, Czechoslovakia's machine manufacturing industry's output in the first three quarters of this year increased by 16.5% compared to the same period last year.

Compared with the output of the first ten months of this year and the first ten months of 1950, the output of hydraulic turbines increased by 3.8 times, steam turbines increased by 10.4%, automatic lathes and semi-automatic lathes increased by 26%, passenger cars increased by 11.5%, and tractors increased by 15%.

It is estimated that Czechoslovakia's machine output this year will increase sixfold compared to 1937. Compared with the pre-war period, the types of products in the machine manufacturing industry have increased by about four times. Currently, machinery and equipment account for approximately 45% of Czechoslovakia's total exports, while in 1937 it only accounted for 6.4%. Exports of complete sets of factory equipment have increased twenty-twofold in the past decade.

Now, almost all workers in the machine manufacturing industry have participated in various forms of socialist emulation. Among them, approximately 80,000 workers in 6,500 production teams are striving for the glorious title of "Socialist Labor Team." Machine manufacturing workers have also shown great enthusiasm in the technical revolution movement, putting forward more than 64,000 innovation proposals in the first half of this year.

This year, the mechanization and automation of the machine manufacturing industry has taken another step forward. This year, some machine manufacturing plants installed a total of 2,000 to 2,500 automatic, semi-automatic, and specialized machines. Great achievements have also been made in overall automation, especially in the mass production of complete sets of machinery. Some semi-automatic and automated production lines installed this year have greatly increased labor productivity. For example, the tractor manufacturing industry has adopted new automated lines in the production of gearbox parts and rear axle bushings. The adoption of automated lines for producing rear axle bushings will increase labor productivity by more than 230%.

    捷机械工业获新发展
    今年机器产量将比战前增加六倍
    新华社布拉格11日电　据这里的报纸报道，捷克斯洛伐克机器制造工业今年头三季度的产量比去年同一时期提高了16.5％。
    拿今年头十个月同1950年头十个月的产量比较，水轮机产量提高了三点八倍，汽轮机提高了10.4％，自动车床和半自动车床提高了26％，客车提高了11.5％，拖拉机提高了15％。
    预计，捷克斯洛伐克今年的机器产量将比1937年增加六倍，同战前比较，机器制造工业的产品种类约增加四倍。目前，机器设备在捷克斯洛伐克总出口量中约占45％，而在1937年仅占6.4％。成套工厂设备的出口在过去十年中增加二十二倍。
    现在，机器制造工业的工人几乎全部参加了各种形式的社会主义竞赛，其中有六千五百个生产队的大约八万名工人正在争取“社会主义劳动队”的光荣称号。机器制造工人在技术革命运动中也表现了很大的积极性，他们在今年上半年共提出了六万四千多项革新建议。
    机器制造业的机械化和自动化方面今年又向前迈进了一步。今年一些机器制造厂总共装置二千到二千五百台自动、半自动和专门性机器。在全盘自动化，特别是在大批成套的机器生产方面，也取得了很大的成绩。今年以来装置的一些半自动和自动化作业线大大地提高了劳动生产率。例如，拖拉机制造工业在生产齿轮箱零件和后轴衬方面已采用了新的自动线。生产后轴衬的自动线的采用，将使劳动生产率提高230％以上。
