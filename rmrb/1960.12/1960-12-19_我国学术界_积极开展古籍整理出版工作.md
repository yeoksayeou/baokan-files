China's Academic Circles
Actively Carry Out the Work of Compiling and Publishing Ancient Books

    In order to effectively carry out the work of compiling and publishing ancient books, the Ancient Books Compilation and Publication Planning Group of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has recently formulated the "Key Plan (Draft) for Compiling and Publishing Ancient Books for Three to Eight Years (1960-1967)". Now, this draft plan has been distributed by the Ministry of Education and the Chinese Academy of Sciences to relevant universities and scientific research departments across the country. In addition to continuing to solicit opinions, the planning group also asked them to incorporate some of the projects in the draft plan into their own research plans based on the teaching and research work of their respective units. The Zhonghua Book Company (which is also the office of the Ancient Books Compilation and Publication Planning Group of the Chinese Academy of Sciences), which is specifically responsible for compiling and publishing ancient Chinese books, is also contacting relevant units to specifically arrange the compilation and writing work of various projects in the draft plan.

    The recently formulated draft plan makes specific elaborations on how to implement the policy of critically inheriting cultural heritage in the compilation of ancient books; At the same time, according to the characteristics of ancient books and the needs of different readers, it also makes a relatively clear explanation of the different compilation methods of ancient books. The draft plan particularly emphasized the purpose of compiling and publishing ancient books. Based on the principles of making the past serve the present and selective and critical approach, the key projects listed in the draft plan are roughly divided into two categories. One category is reading materials for cadres, which is to select a part of important and excellent works from a large number of ancient books by critical methods, add correct and easy-to-understand annotations, or translate and rewrite them into modern language, and write a preface to analyze and criticize the original book and author from the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint, and compile them into several sets of popular reading materials for cadres and students with university and secondary education levels. In addition, in order to systematically introduce historical and cultural knowledge to the vast number of cadres and young students, so that they can absorb beneficial spiritual nourishment from historical heritage, the draft plan also plans to publish three sets of series, namely: "Chinese History Series" (tentatively named), "Chinese History Small Series" and "Newly Compiled Historical Romances". The other category is reference materials for researchers and teachers. This type of book includes important ancient books from all dynasties before the May Fourth Movement in China (such as academic and ideological works of the pre-Qin and Han dynasties, the Twenty-Four Histories, collections of poems and essays by important writers, politicians, and thinkers of all dynasties, and representative monographs, as well as important novels, operas, and literary collections, etc.). Newly compiled reference books (that is, collecting and compiling relevant materials scattered in various ancient books according to problems and chronological order; or compiling similar scattered ancient books with higher historical value into specialized series), reference books (including various dictionaries, chronologies, indexes, etc. related to ancient history and culture), and facsimile ancient books.

    Some of the projects listed in the draft plan have been compiled and published in the past few years, especially in the recent two years, such as: "One Hundred Tang Poems", "One Hundred Song Poems", "Selected Annotations of Storytelling Scripts" in popular reading materials of classical literature; "Selections from the Book of Songs", "Selected Poems of Du Fu", "Romance of the Three Kingdoms", "Water Margin" in selected and annotated and translated and annotated editions of classical literature; "Historical Records", "Records of the Three Kingdoms", "Zizhi Tongjian" and some modern historical materials in historical works; "Collected Annotations of Guanzi", "Modern Translation and New Compilation of Sun Tzu's Art of War", "Translation and Annotations of Mencius", "Brief Explanation of Han Feizi", "Reader of Salt and Iron Monopolies", collections of essays or monographs of Cao Cao, Liu Zongyuan, Li Zhi, Wang Fuzhi, Kang Youwei and others; the Two Han Dynasties part and the Modern part in "Selected Materials on the History of Chinese Philosophy". In addition, "Cefu Yuangui", "Yongle Encyclopedia" and other books have also been reproduced in facsimile. The "Small Series of Chinese History", which popularizes historical knowledge for readers with secondary and elementary education levels, has also published more than 50 titles. These books have played a certain role in critically inheriting historical heritage. Many newly compiled and published ancient books have provided convenient conditions for making ancient books easy to understand and use, and are welcomed by readers. It is estimated that in 1961, various selected and annotated editions of ancient books can be published, such as "Selected Poems of Li Bai", "Selected Poems of Bai Juyi", "Selected Lyrics", "Selected Modern Poems", "Selected Anti-Imperialist and Anti-Feudal Ballads of Modern China", etc., collated and annotated editions and translated and annotated editions of famous works of past dynasties, such as "Penetrating the Essence of Nanhua - Translation and Explanation of the Inner Chapters of Zhuangzi", "The Book of Lord Shang", "Collection of Jia Yi", "Book of Han", "Book of Later Han", "Collection of Hai Rui", "Collection of Lin Zexu", etc., compilations of materials such as "Reference Materials for the History of Chinese Literature", "Reference Materials for Chinese History", "Historical Materials on Chinese Peasant Wars", "Historical Materials on Modern Chinese Railways", "Historical Materials on Modern Chinese Foreign Debt", "Late Qing Dynasty Literary Series", and review materials on classical writers and their works such as the Three Caos, Tao Yuanming, Bai Juyi, Lu You, etc.

    After the draft plan was issued, many relevant universities and scientific research institutions attached great importance to it. At present, many units have put forward positive opinions and suggestions on the draft plan, and some units have also undertaken the compilation and writing work of some projects.

    我国学术界
    积极开展古籍整理出版工作
    为了切实作好整理和出版古籍的工作，中国科学院古籍整理出版规划小组，新近制订了《三年至八年（1960—1967）整理和出版古籍的重点规划（草案）》。现在，这个规划草案已经由教育部和中国科学院分别下达到全国有关的高等院校和科学研究部门。除了继续征求意见以外，规划小组并请他们根据本单位的教学和研究工作的情况，把规划草案中的若干项目纳入他们自己的研究计划中去。专门担负整理和出版我国古籍任务的中华书局（也是中国科学院古籍整理出版规划小组的办事机构），也正在同有关单位联系，具体安排规划草案中的各种项目的整理和编写工作。
    最近制订的这个规划草案，对在整理古籍中如何贯彻执行批判地继承文化遗产的方针，作了具体的阐述；同时根据古籍的特点以及不同读者的需要，对古籍的不同整理方法，也作了比较明确的说明。规划草案特别强调了整理和出版古籍的目的性。根据古为今用和有选择有批判的原则，规划草案中所开列的重点项目大体上分为两类。一类是干部读物，就是要从大量的古籍中，用批判的方法选出一部分重要的优秀作品，加以正确浅明的注释，或者加以今译和改写，并用马克思列宁主义观点写出对原书和作者进行分析批判的序言，分别编成几套供具有大学和中等文化水平的干部和学生阅读的普及读物。此外，为了向广大干部和青年学生系统地介绍历史文化知识，使之从历史遗产中吸收有益的精神营养，规划草案中还计划出版三套丛书，即：《中国历史丛书》（名暂定）、《中国历史小丛书》和《新编历史演义》。另一类是供研究工作者和教学工作者用的参考资料。这类书包括我国五四运动以前历代的重要古籍（如先秦两汉学术思想论著，廿四史，历代重要文学家、政治家、思想家的诗文集和有代表性的专著，以及重要的小说、词曲和文学总集等）。新编的资料书（即分门别类地按问题和时代先后，把散见于各种古籍中的有关材料辑集汇编；或者把具有较高史料价值的同类的零散古籍编为专门的丛书），工具书（包括有关古代历史文化的各类辞典、年表、索引等），以及影印古籍。
    规划草案中所列举的若干项目，在过去几年、特别是最近两年中有的已经整理出版，如：古典文学普及读物中的《唐诗一百首》、《宋诗一百首》、《话本选注》等；古典文学选注本和译注本中的《诗经选》、《杜甫诗选》、《三国演义》、《水浒传》等；历史著作中的《史记》、《三国志》、《资治通鉴》和若干近代史资料等；历代政治家和哲学家著作中的《管子集校》、《今译新编孙子兵法》、《孟子译注》以及《韩子浅解》、《盐铁论读本》，曹操、柳宗元、李贽、王夫之、康有为等人的文集或专著；《中国哲学史资料选辑》中的两汉部分、近代部分。此外，还影印了《册府元龟》、《永乐大典》等。对中等、初等文化水平读者普及历史知识的《中国历史小丛书》，也已经出版了五十多种。这些书籍都在批判地继承历史遗产上起了一定的作用。许多新整理出版的古籍，在使古籍易懂、易用上提供了方便的条件，受到读者的欢迎。预计1961年可以出版各种古籍的选注本如《李白诗选》、《白居易诗选》、《词选》、《近代诗选》、《中国近代反帝反封建歌谣选》等，历代名著的校点本、译注本如《南华透底——庄子内篇译解》《商君书》、《贾谊集》、《汉书》、《后汉书》、《海瑞集》、《林则徐集》等，资料汇编如《中国文学史参考资料》、《中国历史参考资料》、《中国农民战争史料》、《中国近代铁路史料》、《中国近代外债史料》、《晚清文学丛钞》以及三曹、陶渊明、白居易、陆游等古典作家及其作品的评述资料等。
    规划草案发出后，许多有关高等院校和科学研究机关都很重视。目前，已有不少单位对规划草案提出了积极的意见和建议，有些单位还承担了部分项目的整理和编写工作。
