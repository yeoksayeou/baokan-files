    Seize the Favorable Season to Rapidly Harvest and Transport Timber
    Workers in the Greater Khingan Range Forest Area Carry Out Technical Innovations
    (Our Dispatch) In the Greater Khingan Range Forest Area of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, it is now a season of thousands of miles of ice and tens of thousands of miles of snow, the severe cold. But it is also known as the golden season for forestry production. Hardworking and brave people of all ethnic groups, braving the cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius, are making great efforts in technical innovation and technical revolution, doing everything possible to increase production efficiency, and fighting to seize more timber to support national construction.
    Currently, the forest area is a scene of intense labor everywhere. Lumberjacks, holding high-efficiency "May 1st" type curved saws, are busily harvesting timber. As the big trees fall, the rising snow towers into the clouds. Loggers, on steep mountain slopes, dig ice trenches, using the slope to quickly slide the felled timber down the mountain. On the ice roads and highways in the forest, transport workers are driving sleds pulling multi-section trailers, transporting timber to storage yards day and night. From the storage yards, trains loaded with timber head to all parts of the country. The Greater Khingan Range Forest Area has broken the past practice of seasonal operations and achieved outstanding results in year-round operations. By the end of October this year, the forest area's output of logs had completed 82.9% of the annual timber production plan, an increase of 16.2% compared to the same period last year. Seven forestry bureaus, including Xiniqi and Yituli River, have already completed and overfulfilled the state timber production plan ahead of schedule. In the first three quarters of this year, the timber transported out of the forest area has supported the construction of eleven provinces and autonomous regions across the country. In addition to supplying key projects such as Anshan Iron and Steel, Baotou Iron and Steel, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, the Lanzhou Refinery, the Karamay Oilfield, and the Yellow River Sanmenxia Project, it has also supplied a large number of pit props needed by seventeen large coal mines, including Fushun, Kailuan, and Datong, and more than four hundred local coal mines.
    This winter, people of all ethnic groups in the Greater Khingan Range Forest Area are using the ice and snow to carry out technical innovations and technical revolutions in log collection and transportation, and have achieved new results. Now, the newly built ice roads and ice trenches crisscross the mountains and valleys of the forest area, creating a spectacular scene. The use of ice trenches for log collection is a new creation by Wang Yongtai, a worker at the Hayashide Forest Farm of the Kuduer Forestry Bureau. This advanced log collection method, which has been widely promoted in the Greater Khingan Range Forestry Bureau this winter, has changed the old habit of using cattle and horses to collect logs for many years. It not only saves a large number of rural labor and animal power, reduces the burden on rural areas, and saves state funds, but also increases log collection efficiency by more than double compared to last year.
    People of all ethnic groups in the forest area are making full use of ice and snow to serve production. This year, they have newly built more than seventy ice roads, totaling more than 1,300 kilometers in length. The efficiency of transporting timber using ice roads has been repeatedly improved. Sun Changchen, a worker at the Urqihan Forestry Bureau, had one horse pull two, four, and six sleds to transport timber, realizing the "train" operation of horse-drawn sleds on ice roads, which increased efficiency six times compared to the past when one horse only pulled one sled. After the "train" operation of automobile timber transportation, a car also towed two to eight trailers to transport timber, greatly accelerating the transportation of timber. Yang Zhenqi, a heroic driver from the Xiniqi Forestry Bureau, who created the national record for timber transportation, and the chartered team he led, transported a total of 14,335 cubic meters of timber by the end of October, exceeding the quota by more than 900 cubic meters, completing the state's annual timber transportation task two months ahead of schedule, and saving the state more than 7,800 kilograms of oil.
    In the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, the vast number of forestry workers have also proposed the goal of realizing "five-izations" in timber production: mechanization and semi-mechanization of logging, ice trench and ice road for ice-season log collection and transportation, rail transportation for summer log collection, train transportation for timber transportation, and mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading, unloading, sorting, and selection. In order to achieve the "five-izations," workers have put forward more than 27,000 rationalization proposals in the past year, of which 10,000 have been adopted, which has greatly improved the efficiency of forestry production. For example, after the widespread implementation of rail transportation for log collection in the forest area this summer, it not only replaced more than 3,000 cattle and horses and more than 150 tractors, but also increased the efficiency of log collection by about double compared to cattle and horse log collection. In terms of loading, people of all ethnic groups also have many inventions. The advanced loading method created by Wang Shoutong and Zhang Xiushan, workers at the Yituli River Forestry Bureau, is simple in structure, lightweight and flexible, and increases efficiency by one-third to one time compared to manual loading. The loading machine successfully created by Tang Mingfa, a worker at the Yituli River Forestry Bureau, after nine years of hard work, shortens the working hours by four-fifths compared to manual loading. Zhao Changqing, a worker at the Xiniqi Forestry Bureau, also created a combined loading, unloading, and overturning machine, which replaced the heavy labor of manual loading, unloading, piling, and overturning.

    抓住有利季节迅速采伐积运木材
    大兴安岭林区职工开展技术革新
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区大兴安岭林区，现在正是千里冰封、万里雪飘的严寒季节，但也正是被称为林业生产上的黄金季节。勤劳勇敢的各族职工，冒着零下三十多度的严寒，利用冰雪，大搞技术革新和技术革命，千方百计提高生产效率，正为支援国家建设夺取更多的木材而战斗着。
    目前，林区到处是一片紧张劳动的场面。伐木工拿着高工效的“五一”型弯把锯，在紧张地采伐木材。大树一倒，冒起的雪烟高耸入云，集材工在高陡的山岭上，挖成一道道的冰沟，利用斜坡，把伐倒的木材迅速往山下滑放。在林间的冰道和公路上，运输工人驾着爬犁牵引多节拖车，不分昼夜地把木材运进贮木场。从贮木场上，一列列的火车满载着木材奔向祖国各地。大兴安岭林区已打破过去季节性作业的常规，在常年作业方面取得优异的成就，到今年10月底，林区原木产量，已完成全年木材生产计划的82.9％，比去年同时期增长16.2％，已有西尼气、伊图里河等七个林业局，提前和超额完成了国家木材生产计划。今年前三个季度，运出的木材，支援全国十一个省和自治区的建设，除供应鞍钢、包钢、兰新铁路、兰州炼油厂、克拉玛依油田和黄河三门峡等重点工程外，还供应抚顺、开滦、大同等十七个大型煤矿和四百多个地方煤矿所需要的大量坑木。
    今年冬天，大兴安岭各族职工利用冬天的冰雪，大搞集材运材的技术革新和技术革命，获得了新的成果。现在，林区山上山下新修的冰道纵横，冰沟成网，景象十分壮观。利用冰沟集材，是库都尔林业局哈牙士德林场工人王永太的新创造。这项先进的集材方法，今年冬天在大兴安岭林业局普遍推广后，改变了过去多少年来用牛马套子集材的旧习惯，不仅节约了大批农村劳力、畜力，减少了农村负担，节约了国家资金，而且集材效率比去年提高一倍多。
    林区各族职工，充分利用冰雪为生产服务，今年新修长达一千三百多公里的冰道七十多条。运用冰道运输木材的效率一再提高。乌尔其汗林业局工人孙长臣，让一匹马拉两节、四节、六节爬犁运材，实现马拉爬犁冰道运材“列车化”，比过去一匹马只拉一节爬犁运材，提高效率六倍。汽车运材“列车化”后，一辆汽车也牵引二节到八节拖车运材，大大加速了木材的运输。创造全国运材最高纪录的西尼气林业局英雄司机杨振起和他所领导的包车组，到10月底共运回木材一万四千三百三十五立方米，超额九百多立方米，提前两个月完成了国家全年运材任务，并为国家节约油脂七千八百多公斤。
    广大林区职工在大搞技术革新和技术革命运动中，还提出在木材生产上实现“五化”的奋斗目标：采伐机械化、半机械化，冰季积运木材冰沟、冰道化，夏季集材轨道化，运材列车化，装、卸、归、选机械化、半机械化。为实现“五化”，在过去一年中，职工们已提出合理化建议二万七千多件，其中有一万件被采用，这使林业生产的效率大大提高。如今年夏天林区普遍实现了集材轨道化后，不只代替了三千多匹牛马和一百五十多台拖拉机，而且使集材功效比牛马集材提高一倍左右。在装车方面，各族职工也有不少发明创造，伊图里河林业局工人王守通和张秀山创造的先进装车法，结构简单，轻便灵活，比人抬装汽车提高效率三分之一到一倍。伊图里河林业局工人唐明发经过九年刻苦钻研创造成功的装车机，比人工装车缩短工时五分之四。西尼气林业局工人赵长青还创造一种联合装卸倒楞机，代替了人力装车、卸车、上楞、倒楞等笨重的劳动。
