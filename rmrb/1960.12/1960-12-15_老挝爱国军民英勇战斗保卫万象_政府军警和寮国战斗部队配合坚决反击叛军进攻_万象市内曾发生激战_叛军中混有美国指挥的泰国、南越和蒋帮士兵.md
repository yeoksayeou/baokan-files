Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 14th: According to a broadcast by the Lao Fighting Forces radio station this noon: The troops of the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique, directly supported by US imperialism and Thai reactionaries, and constantly landing in Vientiane from the Mekong River bank within Thailand, were heroically blocked by government troops directly commanded by Captain Kong Le on the night of the 13th, and a portion of them were annihilated.

The radio station said that the government troops captured more than one hundred rebels, sank three gunboats, destroyed two armored vehicles, and seized two tanks, one armored vehicle, and many guns and ammunition. Some officers and soldiers of the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique have surrendered to the government troops.

The radio station said that the people and troops of Vientiane are in high spirits, and the fighting is continuing. According to a broadcast by the radio station this morning: At 1:00 PM on the 13th, a troop of the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique, commanded by US officers and mixed with soldiers from the Nai Sarit, Ngo Dinh Diem, and Chiang Kai-shek reactionary groups, launched an attack from Thailand towards the center of Vientiane, the capital of Laos, and engaged in fierce fighting in the Thai embassy and prime minister's residence area of Vientiane. The Lao Royal Army and police, under the command of the Committee for the Defense of the Capital Vientiane headed by Captain Kong Le, coordinated with the Lao Fighting Forces and people's armed forces to launch a heroic and resolute counterattack against the enemy's frenzied offensive. Reports indicate that the rebels once occupied a part of the center of Vientiane.

The radio station pointed out that the masterminds behind the attack on Vientiane are US imperialism and Thai reactionaries, who are using the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique to rudely and directly invade Laos. They must bear full responsibility for all consequences arising from the above-mentioned attack.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 14th: According to a broadcast by the Lao Fighting Forces radio station on the evening of the 13th: Facing the serious moment of aggression by US imperialism and the Thai reactionary clique, youths from all over Laos have expressed their determination to fight resolutely against the aggressors and traitorous clique, and to defend the independence and unity of the country.

According to reports from Vientiane, Xieng Khouang, and southern Laos, youths of all ethnic groups, including Lao Sung, Lao Theung, and Lao Lum, are enthusiastically going to the front lines to defend their motherland. Currently, armed self-defense teams composed of youths are bravely participating in battles in areas such as the Kading River, Pak Sane, and the mouth of the Nam Ngum River. Youths in rural areas have also resolutely stood up, organizing youth armed teams, tightly gripping their weapons, and defending their villages.
