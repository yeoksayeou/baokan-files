    Language Emitter for the Dumb
    A young Soviet radio enthusiast, Prokhorov, has created a language emitter that can help those who are congenitally mute to speak. This emitter is made from a small bakelite box, which is equipped with a flexible wire connected to a storage battery. The mute person only needs to place the box close to their throat, press the switch, and the magnetic vibrations emitted by the emitter will turn the mute person's words into sounds that are loud enough for others to hear.

    哑人语言发声器
    苏联年青的无线电爱好者普罗霍罗夫制成了一个语言发声器，能帮助后天哑人说话。这种发声器是用一个小巧的胶木匣做成的，匣子上装有一根有弹性的电线同蓄电池联系，哑人只要把匣子贴紧喉部，按动开关，这时发声器所发出的磁性震动就能使哑人的话变成足够使别人听到的声音。
