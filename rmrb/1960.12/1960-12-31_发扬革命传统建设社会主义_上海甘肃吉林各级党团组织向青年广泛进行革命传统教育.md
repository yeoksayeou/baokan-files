Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 29th: Shanghai's Party and League organizations at all levels frequently conduct revolutionary tradition education among young people by holding exhibitions and inviting veteran cadres or veteran workers to give reports, which has achieved good results.

The "Exhibition of Revolutionary Life in the Yan'an Era" currently on display at the Youth Palace has been attracting a constant stream of visitors since it opened on November 18th. To meet the demands of the majority of young people, exhibits are now being replicated and displayed in eleven locations, including the Hudong and Huxi Workers' Cultural Palaces. According to recent statistics, more than 500,000 people in the city have visited this exhibition. In addition, more than 1 million people have watched films reflecting revolutionary struggle history. When veteran cadres, veteran soldiers, veteran workers, families of martyrs, or demobilized soldiers are invited to give reports, the vast majority of young people flock to attend.

Party and League organizations at all levels integrate revolutionary tradition education with situational education, the education of communist prospects, collectivism, and labor viewpoints with policy education, and based on the ideological reality of young people, make education targeted, rich, diverse, lively, and vigorous. Some young students went to Jiaotong University to pay their respects at the tomb of martyr Mu Hanxiang. After reading the martyr's motto: "I am willing to be the soil underground, so that people can step on me to reach the bright beyond," their thinking was further enlightened, realizing that their past ideological realm was too small. Some young people, after watching the film "The Eternal Radio Wave," thought of the torture Li Bai suffered. During the discussion, they said: "The martyrs shed their blood for the happiness of our future generations. When they were severely tortured, they only thought of revolution. We should inherit the revolutionary spirit of the martyrs." After visiting the "Exhibition of Revolutionary Life in the Yan'an Era," students from the Railway Institute invited the Party Committee Secretary to report on the work, study, and life of students at the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University in those years.

After receiving revolutionary tradition education, young people on all production fronts have further enhanced their revolutionary drive. The Fang Zhongliang youth steelmaking team of the third converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 received a batch of pig iron with a very high sulfur content. To break through this barrier, all seven young workers in the team proposed to the Party a fighting determination: "No matter how high the sulfur is, with me there will be steel." After working together and overcoming various difficulties, they finally overcame the high-sulfur barrier, making the qualified rate of steel reach more than 99.73%.

Now, Party and League organizations at all levels, together with relevant departments, are further sorting out revolutionary historical materials and establishing a reporting team composed of veteran workers, veteran Red Army soldiers, and families of revolutionary martyrs, preparing to conduct revolutionary tradition education among the vast number of young people in a more organized and planned manner.

This newspaper reports: Recently, the Communist Youth League organizations in many areas of Gansu Province have been conducting in-depth revolutionary tradition education among young people.

The Lanzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League recently invited more than 20 veteran Red Army soldiers to form a "Veteran Red Army Reporting Group," which gave reports to more than 100,000 young people in more than 150 units throughout the city. It also held a meeting between young people and veteran Red Army soldiers throughout the city, providing a profound education to the vast number of young people. Many young people have expressed that they will learn from the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle of the revolutionary predecessors and contribute more to the construction of socialism. The Yumen Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League invited 65 veteran Red Army soldiers, veteran cadres, veteran workers, veteran farmers, and pacesetters in studying Chairman Mao's works to form 13 "Revolutionary Tradition Education Mobile Lecture Teams" to conduct education on carrying forward the excellent revolutionary tradition among young people; they also held exhibitions comparing the past and present, revolutionary tradition education film weeks, and organized visits to the old site of the Yumen Oil Mine to study the mining history of the Yumen Oil Mine, etc. After listening to the reports of the lecture team, the vast number of young people in the city expressed that they would inherit and carry forward the revolutionary tradition of hard struggle and vigorously develop agriculture and grain production. The Jiuquan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League launched an educational activity among young people to "recall the past, compare the present, and look forward to the future," organized young people to study stories of revolutionary struggle, stories of revolutionary leaders, and deeds of heroic and model figures, and also held emancipation forums, hometown change forums, and vision forums.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jilin City's Communist Youth League organizations at all levels extensively organize young people to learn from veteran cadres, veteran workers, and veteran farmers to conduct revolutionary tradition education. Many industrial and mining enterprises organized "Veteran Worker Reporting Groups" and held "Veteran Worker Reporting Months." Up to now, the city has invited 410 veteran cadres, veteran workers, and poor and lower-middle peasants to give more than 480 reports, and tens of thousands of young people in urban and rural areas have been educated.

After the young people listened to the reports, the League organizations in various units also organized the young people to discuss issues such as "the current situation and tasks," "what great ambitions should young people have," and "how to work hard and build the country diligently and thriftily." After the Communist Youth League branch of the Xitaoshan Production Team of the Mingcheng Commune in Panshi County carried out the educational activity of "think about the previous two generations, calculate the past ten years, look forward to a few years, and compare the bitterness and sweetness" among the young people, 36 young people immediately signed up to participate in front-line production. After the Jilin Fertilizer Plant launched the activity of learning from Wang Daoxiu, the "Red Housekeeper," among the veteran workers of the unit, a new atmosphere of actively working, abiding by discipline, and cherishing national property was formed among the young workers, and 118 "Red Housekeepers" and 11 Red Management Groups emerged throughout the plant.

    发扬革命传统建设社会主义
    上海甘肃吉林各级党团组织向青年广泛进行革命传统教育
    新华社上海29日电　上海各级党、团组织通过举办展览会、请老干部或老工人作报告等办法，经常向青年进行革命传统教育，收到了良好的效果。
    目前正在青年宫展出的“延安时代革命生活展览会”，从11月18日开幕以来，每天前往参观的人络绎不断。为了满足广大青年的要求，现在又复制展品，分别在沪东、沪西工人文化宫等十一处展出。据最近统计，全市参观这个展览会的已有五十多万人次。另有一百多万人观看了反映革命斗争史迹的影片。邀请老干部、老战士、老工人、烈士家属或复员军人作报告时，广大青年更是闻讯而至。
    各级党、团组织都把革命传统教育同形势教育结合起来，把共产主义前途教育、集体主义和劳动观点的教育同政策教育结合起来，并针对青年的思想实际，使教育有的放矢，丰富多样，生动活泼。有些青年学生到交通大学瞻仰穆汉祥烈士墓，在读了烈士生前的一句座右铭“我愿做地下的泥土，让人们践踏着走向光明的彼方”以后，思想进一步开朗，认识到自己过去的思想领域太渺小。有些青年在看了“永不消逝的电波”电影以后，想到李白烈士所受的酷刑，在讨论时说：“烈士为我们子孙万代的幸福，抛头颅、洒鲜血，当他们遭到严刑拷打时，脑子里只想到革命二字，我们应该继承先烈们的革命精神。”铁道学院的学生在参观了“延安时代革命生活展览会”以后，又请党委书记报告当年抗日军政大学学生的工作、学习和生活情况。
    各生产战线的青年在受了革命传统教育以后，革命干劲进一步提高。上钢一厂第三转炉车间房忠良青年炼钢班，曾接到一批含硫量很高的生铁。他们为了攻破这一关，全班七个青年工人向党提出“那怕硫再高，有我就有钢”的战斗决心。经过齐心协力，克服种种困难，终于攻下了高硫关，使钢的合格率达到99.73％以上。
    现在，各级党、团组织正同有关部门一起，进一步整理革命史料，成立由老工人、红军老战士、革命烈士家属等参加的报告队伍，准备更加有组织、有计划地向广大青年进行革命传统教育。
    本报讯　最近以来，甘肃省许多地区的共青团组织向广大青年深入地进行革命传统教育。
    共青团兰州市委在最近邀请二十多名老红军，组成“老红军报告团”，分别向全市一百五十多个单位的十万多名青少年作了报告，并举行了全市青少年和老红军会见大会，使广大青少年受到了深刻的教育。许多青年纷纷表示，要学习革命前辈艰苦奋斗的革命精神，为建设社会主义贡献更多的力量。共青团玉门市委邀请老红军、老干部、老工人、老农民和学习毛主席著作的标兵等六十五人，组成十三个“革命传统教育巡回讲演队”，向广大青年进行发扬革命优良传统教育；还举办了今昔对比展览会、革命传统教育电影周，并组织参观玉门油矿旧址，学习玉门油矿矿史等。全市广大青年听了讲演队的报告后，表示要继承和发扬艰苦奋斗的革命传统，大办农业、大办粮食。共青团酒泉市委在青年当中开展“回忆过去，对比现在，展望将来”的教育活动，组织青年学习革命斗争故事，革命领袖故事，英雄模范人物的事迹，还举行了翻身座谈会，家乡变化座谈会和远景座谈会。
    据新华社讯　吉林市各级共青团组织，广泛组织青年向老干部、老工人、老农民学习，进行革命传统教育。许多工矿企业组织了“老工人报告团”，举办了“老工人报告月”。到目前为止，全市已邀请四百一十名老干部、老工人、贫雇农做报告四百八十多次，有十数万城乡青年受到教育。
    各单位团组织在青年们听过报告后，还组织青年们就“当前形势和任务”、“青年人应立什么大志”、“怎样艰苦奋斗，勤俭建国”等问题展开讨论。磐石县明城公社下桃山生产队团支部，在青年中开展了“想想前两代，算算近十年，展望几年后，比比苦和甜”的教育活动以后，有三十六名青年立即报名参加第一线生产。吉林肥料厂开展学习本单位老工人“红色管家人”王道修的活动以后，在青年工人中形成积极劳动、遵守纪律、爱护国家财产的新风尚，全厂出现了一百一十八名“红色管家人”和十一个红色管理小组。（附图片）
