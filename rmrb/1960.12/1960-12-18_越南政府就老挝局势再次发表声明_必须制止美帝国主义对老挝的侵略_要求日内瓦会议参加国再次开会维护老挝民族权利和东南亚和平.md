Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 17th. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam today issued another statement on the Laotian situation. The full text of the statement is as follows:

    The Laotian situation, which has been tense for some time, has recently become even more serious. The deep roots and direct causes of this situation are the intervention of American imperialism and its servant states in the internal affairs of Laos. American imperialism's intervention in Laos is an attempt to turn Laos into an American military base, to prepare a new war in Indochina and Southeast Asia, and to trample on the 1954 Geneva Agreements on Laos.

    The 1954 Geneva Agreements restored peace to Laos on the basis of respecting Lao sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity. This was a great victory for the Lao people, as well as for the people of Indochina and peace-loving people around the world. It shattered the conspiracy of American imperialism to expand and prolong the Indochina War. The Geneva Agreements, as well as the Vientiane Agreements later signed between the Kingdom of Laos government and the Lao Fighting Units, stipulated provisions aimed at neutralizing Laos, realizing national reconciliation, and guaranteeing the peaceful and neutral policy of the Kingdom of Laos in accordance with the wishes of the Lao people.

    American imperialism's intervention in Laos has aroused growing public anger among the Lao people. On August 9, 1960, the patriotic Lao army and people from all walks of life staged a coup, followed by the formation of a government headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma as Prime Minister, and announced the implementation of a truly peaceful and neutral line. American imperialism and its lackeys, the reactionary authorities of Thailand and South Vietnam, have flagrantly interfered in the internal affairs of Laos, providing military assistance to the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group, and even directly participating in the military activities of the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group, attempting to overthrow the peaceful and neutral government of Prince Souvanna Phouma and establish a puppet government to serve as a tool for realizing American imperialism's aggression and war policy. American imperialism's intervention in Laos by its servant states has become even more blatant recently during the rebel group's attack on the capital Vientiane.

    The current situation in Laos is very dangerous: the war may spread; the Southeast Asian military aggressive bloc headed by the United States is preparing to massively intervene in Laos; a hotbed of war has appeared in this region; the peace of Indochina and Southeast Asia is once again seriously threatened, and the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is under direct threat.

    While intervening in Laos, American imperialism is also blatantly interfering in South Vietnam, violating the Geneva Agreements, undermining the peace and unification of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and turning South Vietnam into a new-style colony and military base for American imperialism to prepare for a new war.

    The current situation in Laos is of great concern to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly stated its position on the Lao situation, that the Geneva Agreements on Laos must be strictly implemented; and that the peaceful neutrality and national harmony policies of the Kingdom must be guaranteed in accordance with the wishes of the Lao people. As for ourselves, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has always respected the Geneva Agreements and hopes to establish good-neighborly relations with the Kingdom of Laos on the basis of the Five Peaceful Coexistence Principles and the Bandung Spirit. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam warmly welcomes the efforts made by the Souvanna Phouma government to follow the path of peaceful neutrality and to establish friendly relations with all countries, especially neighboring countries.

    In a statement issued on September 15, 1959, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believed that the tense situation in Laos must and can only be resolved on the basis of and within the scope of the Geneva Agreements, and at the same time, it believed that reconvening a meeting of the participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference was a good way to resolve the Lao problem.

    At present, facing the spreading war in Laos that threatens peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that reconvening a meeting of the participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference to seek ways to extinguish the flames of war, stop the aggression of American imperialism and its servants against Laos, stabilize the situation in Laos, and guarantee the basic national rights of the Lao people is even more important and more urgent. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam also believes that the activities of the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Laos, including representatives from Poland and Canada, and chaired by a representative from India, must be restored.

    The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam earnestly calls on the participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference, the countries of Asia and Africa, and peace-loving countries around the world to work together to find ways to stop foreign intervention in Laos, restore peace in Laos, guarantee the peaceful neutrality and national harmony policies of the Kingdom of Laos government, ensure peace and security for countries in Southeast Asia, and contribute to the consolidation of world peace.

### 越南政府就老挝局势再次发表声明  必须制止美帝国主义对老挝的侵略  要求日内瓦会议参加国再次开会维护老挝民族权利和东南亚和平

    越南政府就老挝局势再次发表声明
    必须制止美帝国主义对老挝的侵略
    要求日内瓦会议参加国再次开会维护老挝民族权利和东南亚和平
    新华社河内17日电　越南民主共和国政府今天就老挝局势再次发表声明，声明全文如下：
    已经紧张一个时期的老挝局势，最近变得更为严重了。这种局势的深远根源和直接原因是美帝国主义及其仆从国家对老挝内部事务的干涉。美帝国主义干涉老挝，是企图把老挝变成美国的军事基地，在印度支那和东南亚准备一次新的战争，蹂躏1954年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议。
    1954年日内瓦协议在尊重老挝主权、独立、统一和领土完整的基础上，恢复了老挝的和平。这是老挝人民以及印度支那人民和世界爱好和平人民的一个伟大的胜利，它粉碎了美帝国主义企图扩大和拖延印度支那战争的阴谋。日内瓦协议以及以后老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队之间所签定的万象协议，已经规定了旨在使老挝中立化，实现民族和睦，保证符合老挝人民愿望的老挝王国的和平中立政策的各项条款。
    美帝国主义对老挝的干涉，在老挝人民中引起了日益高涨的公愤。1960年8月9日，老挝爱国军队和各阶层人民举行了政变，接着成立了由梭发那·富马亲王为首相的政府，并宣布实现真正的和平中立路线。美帝国主义及其走狗泰国和南越反动当局，对老挝内部事务进行了猖狂干涉，在军事上竭力帮助富米·诺萨万叛乱集团，甚至直接参加富米·诺萨万叛乱集团的军事活动，企图推翻梭发那·富马亲王的和平中立的政府，建立一个傀儡政府，以作为实现美帝国主义的侵略和战争政策的得力工具。美帝国主义及其仆从国家对老挝的干涉，在最近叛乱集团进攻首都万象的时候，变得更加嚣张。
    目前老挝局势非常危险：战争可能要蔓延；以美国为首的东南亚军事侵略集团正在准备大规模干涉老挝；战争温床已在这个地区出现；印度支那和东南亚的和平再一次遭到严重威胁，越南民主共和国的安全正在受到直接威胁。
    与对老挝进行干涉的同时，美帝国主义还极其明目张胆地干涉越南南方，破坏日内瓦协议，破坏越南民主共和国的和平、统一，把越南南方变为美帝国主义准备新战争的新式殖民地和军事基地。
    老挝当前局势使越南民主共和国极为担忧。越南民主共和国政府曾经多次表明自己对于老挝局势的立场，即必须严正履行关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议；根据老挝人民的愿望而使王国的和平中立和民族和睦政策得到保障。至于我们自己，越南民主共和国政府一贯尊重日内瓦协议，并希望同老挝王国在和平共处五项原则和万隆精神的基础上建立睦邻关系，越南民主共和国政府热烈欢迎梭发那·富马政府为遵循和平中立路线和同所有国家、特别是各邻国建立友好关系所作出的努力。
    在1959年9月15日发表的声明中，越南民主共和国政府认为，老挝紧张局势必须而且只能够在日内瓦协议的基础上和范围内加以解决，同时认为，再次召开1954年日内瓦会议参加国会议，是解决老挝问题的良好办法。
    目前，面临老挝战争正在蔓延而威胁印度支那和东南亚的和平，越南民主共和国认为，再次召开1954年日内瓦会议参加国的会议，以寻求扑灭战争火焰、制止美帝国主义及其仆从对老挝的侵略、稳定老挝局势、保证老挝人民基本的民族权利的办法，就更为重要，更为迫切。越南民主共和国政府还认为，必须恢复包括波兰和加拿大代表、由印度代表为主席的老挝国际监察和监督委员会的活动。
    越南民主共和国政府恳切呼吁1954年日内瓦会议参加国、亚非各国和全世界爱好和平的国家，共同努力寻求办法，以制止外国干涉老挝，恢复老挝的和平，保障老挝王国政府的和平中立和民族和睦政策，保障东南亚地区各国的和平和安全，为巩固世界和平作出贡献。
