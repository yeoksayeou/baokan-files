All Kinds of Decoration Hardware Available

Bolts for locking doors, clothes hooks for hanging clothes, etc., may seem like small items, but they are closely related to every household. The Shanghai Guo Zhi Ji Hardware Store specializes in these kinds of decoration hardware.

The relevant leading departments attach great importance to maintaining and developing the business characteristics of this store. They have organized Guo Zhi Ji and more than twenty small commodity factories, as well as more than ten street and lane production organizations, to establish fixed cooperative relationships and produce new decoration hardware products according to market needs at any time.

This hardware store, which has been open for more than thirty years, now carries an increasing variety of products. Walking into the sales department, you can see many commodities that are not usually found in hardware stores, such as chair leg nails nailed to the bottom of chair legs, springs installed in sofas, and picture hooks for hanging mirror frames on the wall. Not only are there many varieties here, but also complete specifications. Take iron rods for hanging curtains as an example, there are nine kinds of thicknesses, the thickest like a water pipe, the thinnest like lead wire. Now, Guo Zhi Ji carries more than six hundred kinds of commodities, and indoor decoration hardware is almost all available.

    装璜五金样样有
    锁门用的插肖，挂衣用的衣钩等等物件，看来都是些小东西，却跟家家户户有密切关系。上海郭志记五金店专门经营这类装璜五金。
    有关领导部门对保持和发扬这家商店的经营特色十分重视，组织郭志记和二十多个小商品工场、十多个街道里弄生产组织建立了固定的协作关系，随时根据市场需要，生产新的装璜五金商品。
    这家开设了三十多年的五金商店，现在经营品种越来越多。走进门市部，可以看到许多五金店通常所没有的商品，譬如钉在椅子脚底下的椅脚钉，装在沙发里的弹簧，墙上挂镜框用的画镜钩等等。这里不但品种多，而且规格齐，拿挂窗帘的铁梗来说，粗粗细细就有九种，最粗的像自来水管，最细的像铅丝。现在，郭志记经营的商品有六百多种，室内装璜五金几乎应有尽有。
