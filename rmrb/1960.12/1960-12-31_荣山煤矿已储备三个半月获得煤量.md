    Rongshan Coal Mine has Stockpiled Three and a Half Months' Worth of Coal

    (By our reporter) The Rongshan Coal Mine in Sichuan Province has strengthened its tunneling team and focused on advanced tunneling. It has now prepared three and a half months' worth of coal extraction volume for mining, laying a good foundation for increased coal production next year.

    In order to ensure a substantial and sustained increase in raw coal production next year, the Rongshan Coal Mine Party Committee recently took decisive measures to focus on tunneling work. They first compressed the labor force in the second line to strengthen tunneling, and also readjusted a group of tunneling workers who had been transferred, so that the tunneling team rapidly expanded from more than 400 people to more than 1,000 people. At the same time, a group of energetic and experienced section-level cadres were delegated to serve as tunneling team leaders, and one to two deputy mine chiefs were appointed in each mine to specifically manage tunneling, strengthening specific leadership, which greatly changed the face of tunneling.

    荣山煤矿已储备三个半月获得煤量
    本报讯  四川省荣山煤矿充实掘进队伍，大抓掘进超前，现在已给回采准备了三个半月的获得煤量，为明年煤炭增产打下了良好基础。
    为了保证明年原煤大幅度持续高产，荣山煤矿党委最近采取果断措施，大抓掘进工作。他们首先压缩第二线的劳力充实掘进，并将原来抽走的一批掘进工调整归队，使掘进队伍由四百余人迅速壮大到一千余人。与此同时，下放了一批干劲足、经验丰富的科室干部担任掘进队长，各井确定了专管掘进的副井长一至二名加强具体领导，使掘进面貌大大改观。
