    On the Zêtang Plain on the south bank of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, there is still a garden called "Sanla." Legend says that this is where the Tibetan ancestors first tried to plant grains after evolving from apes to humans. When did agricultural production begin in Tibet? Archaeologists have not yet found the answer, but according to existing written records, it has been at least 1,300 years. Songtsen Gampo vigorously promoted farming techniques, Princess Wencheng brought agricultural skills and improved varieties from the interior of the motherland, and the industrious people, generation after generation, used their hands to cultivate fertile land in the plains, valleys, and mountains, establishing numerous agricultural production bases and opening up vast agricultural production fronts.
    However, as the Tibetan proverb says, "A steed cannot run if its hooves are hobbled, how can a wild goose fly if its wings are clipped?" Under the barbaric shackles of the feudal serf system, Tibetan farmers toiled on the land until their bones were broken and their blood and sweat were exhausted, yet they still could not escape the manipulation of nature, nor could they escape the torment of generations of poverty and hunger. The people's infinite creativity was suppressed and constrained. Large areas of land were abandoned, farming techniques were backward, and agricultural production declined day by day...
    Where was the way out?
    The Party pointed out the way for Tibetan farmers—to completely destroy the reactionary serf system that hindered social progress and fundamentally change the backward relations of production. Unleash the steeds' feet, give the wild geese strong wings, and hand over the free labor, land, livestock, and tools to the farmers.
    Now, from the towering Hengduan Mountains to the magnificent plateau top, from the vast Qiangtang grasslands to the thousands of miles of continuous forest zone, more than 800,000 liberated Tibetan farmers are rising up as masters of their own destiny, with a force like a volcanic eruption, irresistible. In just over a year, they have demonstrated a vitality in Tibetan agricultural production that has never been seen in centuries under the serf system.
    Listen to the good news from all directions, look at the heroes from all over the country. At the recent Tibet Autonomous Region Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers held in Lhasa, miracle after miracle, innovation after innovation, "the first," "the first time," "the first batch," one after another "first," like twinkling stars, dazzled the eyes...
    Who is that spirited young man? What is he thinking so hard about in a corner of the meeting place? He is 22-year-old Renqing Luobu, deputy township head of Xide Township in Ali Prefecture, and representative of an advanced agricultural production collective.
    Located in the Ali Xide Township, nestled in the snow-capped mountains at an average altitude of more than 4,300 meters, due to the extremely cold climate and extremely difficult irrigation, the 3,068 *ke* of land in the township, since the ancestors began planting, in legend and memory, the yield per *ke* has never exceeded 3 *ke*. In order to solve the problem of water conservancy and irrigation, local serf owners had repeatedly used whips and sticks to force serfs and slaves to climb the snow-capped mountains to build canals. However, many years passed, some people lost their lives, some became disabled, the snow-capped mountains still stood tall, and the canals remained only a virtual line in the serf owners' minds. After the democratic reform, the situation fundamentally changed. Under the leadership of the Party, Renqing Luobu led a team composed of the strongest laborers in the township's production mutual aid groups, following the slopes where their fathers and brothers had shed blood and sweat, climbing the sparsely populated snow-capped mountains, chiseling open rock walls, digging up frozen soil, braving the biting alpine wind and snow, and launching a thrilling canal construction battle. After ten days of hard work, Renqing Luobu and his companions finally built two canals, bringing the torrential snow water that generations had longed for down the mountain, ensuring the irrigation of the township's land, and enabling the township's average yield per *ke* to reach more than 7 *ke* this year, achieving a great harvest that they had never dreamed of in the past.
    Carrying the excitement and pride of the people of the township, Renqing Luobu came to participate in this conference. However, everything at the conference made him feel surprised and excited. He deeply felt that compared with the comrades in other places, he and his partners had done too little and not enough. He sat there attentively, pondering every word of the leaders' valuable instructions and the various experiences of his comrades. The cultural night school established after the democratic reform enabled him to briefly record the leaders' valuable instructions and the various experiences of his comrades. He thought about it seriously, calculated it again and again, and then, with great confidence, he stepped onto the rostrum and waved his fist with full confidence, saying: "Our township's farmers resolutely respond to the Party's call. Next year, the average yield per *ke* of our township's land must be increased to 9 *ke*, increasing production by more than 25% on the basis of this year's bumper harvest."
    With the destruction of the serf system in Tibet, the primitive production methods and habits that had continued for more than a dozen centuries in Tibetan history began to be gradually eliminated, and the productive forces under a new relationship of production began to change the backwardness of the Tibetan agricultural areas.
    Please listen to the narration of Niangmu, the 19-year-old female township head of the Menba people.
    Radiating vigorous youthful vitality, with constant laughter blending sincere joy and optimism, she—Niangmu, the 19-year-old female township head, comes from a remote mountainous area at the northern foot of the Himalayas.
    Under the heavy oppression of the serf system in Tibet, the Menba farmers in this mountainous area, until last winter, were still using a wooden stick called "su" to dig the ground and a wooden stick called "duozhi" to rake grass. From sowing to harvesting, it was difficult to find an iron tool. Although the soil here is fertile and the climate is mild, disasters and hunger, like night following day, always tormented the people here. It was not until after the democratic reform that the Menba people were completely liberated. A large number of new-style agricultural implements were continuously transported to the hometown of the Menba people. In Niangmu's township alone, 20 farmers were distributed 13 new-style walking plows free of charge, and purchased dozens of other production tools such as iron shovels, iron hoes, iron rakes, and *lei jia*, bringing about a profound and revolutionary change in the long-stagnant agricultural production of the Menba. The cultivated land area of Niangmu's township, in just a few months from last winter to this spring, expanded from about 40 *ke* to 285 *ke*, and the average yield of highland barley per *ke* in the township reached more than 20 *ke*, more than doubling the previous year. The young Menba girl excitedly said: "The ice mountain pressing on our heads has melted, and Chairman Mao's happy sun has risen!"
    In those dark years trampled by the iron hooves of the serf owners, how strong was the longing of the Tibetan people for freedom! There are two famous folk songs circulating among them saying, "If the hand is one's own, one can pluck the moon from the edge of the sky; if the foot is one's own, one can enter the paradise of happiness." Today, after becoming the masters of their own lives, their strength can truly move mountains and overturn the universe. What did not exist in the past will exist today; what was only a fantasy in the past will become a reality today.
    A popular Tibetan folk tale says that a strange seed filled the entire barn. This merely reflects people's empty hope and yearning for agricultural production, but it pales in comparison to the production miracles of the already liberated Tibetan farmers.
    Yuzhen, a female farmer representative from Lang County in Shannan, who had been a beast of burden for the serf owner for 23 years, was distributed land in the land reform movement last November and only then began to work for herself for the first time. With soaring enthusiasm for labor, rich production experience, coupled with the care and cultivation of the Party and the government, Yuzhen harvested a full 50 *ke* of highland barley from her one *ke* of carefully cultivated land.
    Yuzhen is a simple middle-aged woman. Among the representatives, she has nothing special. The hardships of the past have engraved deep wrinkles on her forehead, and even in moments of joy, one can see the marks of pain left by the old system. But she has become the "Bamu" (female hero) admired by everyone attending the meeting. When she walked into the meeting hall wearing a glittering medal, her heart was pounding violently, her feet were trembling with excitement, and she stood for a long time in front of the huge portrait of Chairman Mao. The tragic scenes of the past flashed before her eyes, and thousands of thoughts surged in her mind: "Respected Chairman Mao, it was you who gave me freedom, gave me land, and taught me good methods of production. Everything today was given by you!"
    The good news from agricultural production from the Yadong River Valley at the foot of the Himalayas greatly invigorated the people attending the meeting. The liberated farmers of Qima Township reversed their previous production habits, increased the land multiple cropping index, and planted three crops a year on two-tenths of the township's fields. From last winter to now, the winter highland barley, summer buckwheat, and autumn turnip planted have all achieved unprecedented bumper harvests, and the yields of highland barley and buckwheat have more than doubled compared to previous years. This is truly an innovation in the history of agricultural production in Tibet.
    Zeren Duoji told people that things were not always smooth sailing in production. In the spring, just as the highland barley was growing vigorously, some mountainous areas encountered a rare drought, and people had to carry wooden buckets to the foot of the mountain to carry water for irrigation; in the autumn, when the buckwheat was about to ripen, they encountered three consecutive days of frost, and people, regardless of men, women, old or young, day or night, lit bonfires next to the fields. After several intense battles, they finally achieved a bumper harvest...
    What do these exciting heroic images and their deeds, these exciting words and the ideas they represent, illustrate? That is: under the shining of the Party's three red banners, the steeds on the Tibetan Plateau have begun to gallop; the wild geese on the snow-capped mountains have begun to soar! The people's potential is infinite, especially the Tibetan serfs who have been suppressed for so long. Then, please think about it, can the speed of this steed galloping and wild goose soaring be calculated in *dao li*?

    骏马奔驰了，大雁高飞了
    郭超人　马宁轩
    在雅鲁藏布江南岸的泽当平原上，至今保存着一块名叫“散拉”的园圃，传说这是藏族祖先们从猿猴进化到人类后第一次试种五谷的地方。西藏是从什么时候开始有农业生产的呢？考古学家还没有来得及找出答案，但是就已有的文字材料的记载看，至少也有一千三百多年的历史。松赞干布大力倡导过耕作技术，文成公主带来了祖国内地的农艺和良种，勤劳的人民世世代代用双手在平原、在河谷、在山岭开垦出良田，建立起无数农业生产的据点，开辟了广阔的农业生产的阵地。
    但是，正像西藏谚语所说的，“骏马套住了蹄子不能行走，大雁剪去了翅膀怎能飞翔？”在野蛮的封建农奴制度的枷锁下，西藏农民在土地上累断了筋骨，耗尽了血汗，仍然无法摆脱大自然的拨弄，无法摆脱世代贫穷和饥饿的折磨，人民无穷的创造力被压抑着，束缚着，大批土地荒芜了，耕作技术落后了，农业生产一天天地走向衰败……。
    出路在哪里呢？
    党为西藏农民指明了出路——彻底摧毁阻碍着社会前进的反动的农奴制度，彻底改变落后的生产关系。给骏马解开脚上的锁链，给大雁装上矫健的翅膀，把自由的劳动，把土地、牲畜和工具交给农民。
    现在，从峰峦重迭的横断山区，到雄伟壮丽的高原顶部，从辽阔无边的羌塘草原，到千里连绵的森林地带，获得了翻身的八十多万西藏农民，以主人翁的姿态奔腾而起，其势如火山爆发，不可抗拒，在短短一年多的时间中，在西藏农业生产上表现了农奴制度下多少世纪以来从未有过的生命力。
    听一听四面八方的捷报，看一看天南地北的英雄，在日前拉萨举行的西藏全区先进集体和先进生产者代表大会上，一个接一个的奇迹，一个又一个的创举，“第一个”，“第一次”，“第一批”，一个跟一个的“第一”，像闪烁的繁星，使你眼花缭乱……
    那个神采奕奕的青年人是谁？他坐在会场的一角在苦苦地思索些什么呢？他是二十二岁的仁青洛布，阿里专区席德乡的副乡长，农业生产先进集体的代表。
    座落在雪岭连绵平均拔海四千三百多米的阿里席德乡，由于气候十分寒冷、灌溉极端困难，全乡三千零六十八克土地，从祖辈播种以来，在传说里，在记忆中，每克地产量从来没有超过三克。为了解决水利灌溉，当地农奴主曾几次使用皮鞭和木棍强逼农奴和奴隶爬上雪山，修筑渠道。但是，多少年过去了，有的人丧失了生命，有的人变成了残废，雪山仍然屹立，渠道仍然只是农奴主脑海中的一根虚线。民主改革以后，情况根本改变了。在党的领导下，仁青洛布带领着一支由全乡生产互助组里最强壮的劳动力组成的队伍，沿着父兄抛洒过血汗的坡岭，登上罕无人迹的雪山，凿开岩壁，挖开冻土，冒着刺骨的高空风雪，展开了惊心动魄的修渠大战。仁青洛布和他的伙伴们经过了整整十天的苦战，终于修成了两条渠道，把祖祖辈辈望眼欲穿的滔滔雪水引下了山岗，保证了全乡土地的灌溉，使今年全乡每克土地平均产量达到七克以上，获得了过去连做梦也没有想到的大丰收。
    带着全乡人民的兴奋和自豪，仁青洛布来参加这次的大会。但是，大会上的一切，使他感到惊讶、激动。他深深感到，比起其他地方的战友们，他和自己的伙伴做得太少太不够了。他聚精会神地坐在那里，琢磨着扩音器里的每一个字句。民主改革以后开办的文化夜校，使他能够简要地记下首长们的宝贵指示和战友们的各种经验。他认真想了又想，算了又算，然后，雄赳赳地走上了主席台，信心百倍地挥舞着拳头说：“我们全乡农民坚决响应党的号召，明年，我们全乡每克土地的平均产量一定要提高到九克，在今年丰收的基础上增产25％以上。”
    随着西藏农奴制度的被摧毁，在西藏历史上延续了十几个世纪的原始的生产方法和生产习惯，开始在逐步消灭，一种新的生产关系下的生产力正开始改变着西藏农区的落后面貌。
    请听那位门巴人的十九岁的女乡长娘姆的叙述。
    浑身焕发着旺盛的青春活力，不断的笑声融汇着由衷的喜悦和开朗，她——十九岁的女乡长娘姆，来自喜马拉雅北麓一个偏远的山区。
    在西藏农奴制度沉重的压榨下，这个山区的门巴农民，直到去年冬天，还在使用一种名叫“素”的木棍挖地，使用一种名叫“朵枝”的木棍耙草，从播种到收割，很难找到一件铁制的工具。尽管这里土壤肥沃，气候温和，但是，灾荒饥饿就像黑夜跟随着白天，总在折磨着这里的人们。直到民主改革以后，门巴人才彻底地翻了身。大批新式农具，源源不断地运到了门巴人的家乡，仅娘姆这个乡的二十户农民，就无偿地分到了十三部新式步犁，买到了铁铲、铁镐、铁耙和?耞等数十件其它生产工具，使门巴长期停滞的农业生产，发生了深刻的革命性的变化。娘姆这个乡的耕地的面积，仅在去冬今春短短几个月的时间中，就由四十来克扩大到二百八十五克，全乡每克地的青稞平均产量达到二十克之多，比往年增产一倍以上。这位年青的门巴姑娘激动地说：“压在我们头上的冰山融化了，毛主席的幸福太阳升起来了！”
    在农奴主铁蹄践踏的那些黑暗的岁月里，西藏人民对自由寄予了多么强烈的向往啊！在他们中间流传着两句名谣说：“如果手是自己的，可以摘下天边的月亮，如果脚是自己的，可以走进幸福的天堂。”今天，在成为自己生活的主人以后，他们的力量真能移山倒海，改变乾坤。过去没有的，今天就会有，过去只是幻想，今天就会变成现实。
    一个受人欢迎的西藏民间故事说，一颗奇异的种子填满了整个谷仓。这不过反映了人们对农业产量的一种空洞的希冀和憧憬，但是比起已经翻身的西藏农民在生产上的奇迹，却大失光彩。
    为农奴主当了二十三年牛马的山南朗县女农民代表玉珍，在去年11月的土地改革运动中，分得了土地，才第一次开始为自己而劳动。高涨的劳动热情，丰富的生产经验，加上党和政府的关怀与培养，玉珍在自己的一克精心耕作的田地里，整整收获了五十克青稞。
    玉珍，这是一个纯朴的中年妇人，在代表们中间，她没有任何特殊的地方。昔日的苦难在她的额前刻下深陷的皱纹，就是在欢乐的时刻也能看到旧制度给她留下的痛苦的烙印。但是她却成为到会代表人人敬羡的“巴姆”（女英雄）。当她佩戴着金光闪烁的奖章走进会场，她的心在剧烈的跳动，她的脚因为兴奋而战栗，她长久地伫立在毛主席的巨幅画像面前。往日的惨景在她眼前划过，千头万绪的思潮在她脑子中翻腾：“敬爱的毛主席啊，是您给了我自由，给了我土地，又教给了我生产上的好办法，今天的一切都是您给的！”
    从喜马拉雅山下亚东河谷传来的农业生产上的喜讯，使到会的人们极为振奋。获得翻身的其玛乡农民，一反以往的生产习惯，提高土地复种指数，在全乡十分之二的田地上一年种植了三种作物。从去冬到现在，种植的冬季青稞，夏季荞麦和秋季元根都获得空前的丰收，青稞和荞麦产量比往年增产一倍。这真是西藏农业生产史上的创举。
    泽仁多吉告诉人们说，在生产中并不是一帆风顺的。春天，正当青稞茁壮的时节，部分山地遇到少有的大旱，人们不得不背着木桶到山下背水灌溉；秋天，当荞麦快要成熟的时候，又遇上了连续三天的霜冻，人们不分男女老幼，不分白天黑夜，在田地旁边升起一堆堆篝火。经过几场紧张的战斗，终于获得了丰收……。
    这些激动人心的英雄形象和他们的事迹，这些激动人心的语言和它们所代表的思想，说明了一件什么大事呢？那就是：在党的三面红旗照耀下，西藏高原上的骏马，开始奔驰了；雪山上的大雁，开始飞翔了！人民的潜力是无穷无尽的，何况是被压抑了这么久的西藏农奴。那么，请你们想一想，这骏马奔驰和大雁高飞的速度，难道是可以用道里来计算的吗？
