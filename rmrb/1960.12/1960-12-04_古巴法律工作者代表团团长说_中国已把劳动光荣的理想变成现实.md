Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd—Santiago Cuba, the head of the Cuban legal workers delegation and Attorney General of the Cuban Supreme Court, met with Xinhua News Agency reporters before leaving Beijing and praised the soaring enthusiasm of the Chinese people in building socialism. He said, "It is difficult to find people who are not working in China. All the people are contributing to the great cause of socialism." He praised the tremendous achievements of China's Great Leap Forward and believed that walking on two legs is a very good policy; it has distributed steel mills throughout the country, greatly increased steel production, and mobilized the strength of the whole people, truly realizing the Great Leap Forward.

He was very moved by the happy mood of the Chinese people in labor. He said, "For us, it is a very good example that senior leading cadres to ordinary workers and peasants participate in physical labor. The ideal of labor glory has become a reality in China."

Santiago Cuba said: Anyone who visits China will see the achievements of the People's Communes with their own eyes, and will understand that the imperialist propaganda about the failure of the People's Communes is all lies. He said: Imperialism will continue to slander the People's Communes, but the rice and wheat produced by the People's Communes will increase day by day.

He also praised China's judicial system and its achievements in transforming criminals into useful members of society.

    古巴法律工作者代表团团长说
    中国已把劳动光荣的理想变成现实
    据新华社2日讯　古巴法律工作者代表团团长、古巴最高法院检察长圣地亚哥·古巴在离京前夕接见了新华社记者，盛赞中国人民建设社会主义的冲天干劲。他说：“在中国很难找到不做工作的人，全体人民为着伟大的社会主义事业贡献力量。”他盛赞中国的大跃进的巨大成就，并且认为两条腿走路是很好的政策；它使炼钢厂分布全国、大大增加了钢的产量、动员了全民力量，真正实现了大跃进。
    他对中国人民在劳动中的愉快心情很感动。他说：“对我们说来，从高级领导干部到普通工农都参加体力劳动，这是很好的榜样，劳动光荣的理想在中国已成为现实。”
    圣地亚哥·古巴说：凡是访问中国的人，都会亲眼看到人民公社的成就，都会了解帝国主义散布关于人民公社失败的宣传全是撒谎。他说：帝国主义对人民公社还会继续进行污蔑，但人民公社生产的大米、小麦将会一天天增加。
    他还称赞中国的司法制度和把犯人改造成为对社会有用的人这方面的成就。
