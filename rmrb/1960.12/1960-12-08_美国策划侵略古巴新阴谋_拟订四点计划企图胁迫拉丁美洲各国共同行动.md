　　Xinhua News Agency, Havana, December 6th: The Cuban newspaper *Revolución* revealed that the U.S. State Department has drafted a four-point plan and is putting pressure on Latin American governments in an attempt to coerce them into jointly implementing this plan and launching a new offensive against the Cuban revolution.

　　The newspaper revealed the content of the U.S.-made plan to oppose Cuba in military, political, and economic aspects: collectively severing diplomatic relations with Cuba and implementing a trade "embargo"; establishing a Pan-American police force; establishing a committee to study the political situation in Latin American countries. According to the newspaper, U.S. government officials recently held talks in Puerto Rico with Venezuelan Ambassador to the United States, José Antonio Mayobre, Puerto Rican Governor Muñoz Marín, and former Costa Rican President José Figueres.

　　An Associated Press dispatch from Caracas, Venezuela, on December 6th confirmed that the United States had conducted "exploratory" talks with Latin American governments regarding this four-point plan. The news agency quoted "reliable sources" as revealing that the main target of the Pan-American police force, which the United States has again proposed to establish in this plan, is Cuba. These sources also said that the task of the proposed political committee is to "study the infiltration of communism into the continent." As is well known, "opposing communist infiltration" has always been a clumsy excuse used by the United States to interfere in Cuba.

　　*Revolución* said that some Latin American governments have expressed reservations about the U.S. plan because it may provoke popular opposition on the continent. However, the U.S. government has not considered this factor in its continuous conspiracy against the Cuban revolution.

### 美国策划侵略古巴新阴谋  拟订四点计划企图胁迫拉丁美洲各国共同行动

    美国策划侵略古巴新阴谋
    拟订四点计划企图胁迫拉丁美洲各国共同行动
    新华社哈瓦那6日电　古巴《革命报》揭露，美国国务院已经拟订一项四点计划，并且正在对拉丁美洲国家的政府施加压力，以便胁迫它们一起推行这项计划，发动反对古巴革命的新进攻。
    这家报纸揭露了美国制订的这项从军事、政治、经济各方面反对古巴的计划的内容：集体断绝同古巴的外交关系，实行贸易“禁运”；建立一支泛美警察部队；成立一个研究拉丁美洲各国政治局势的委员会。据这家报纸报道，美国政府官员最近在波多黎各同委内瑞拉驻美国大使何塞·安东尼奥·马约夫雷、波多黎各总督莫尼奥斯·马林和哥斯达黎加前总统何塞·菲格雷斯举行了会谈。
    美联社6日发自委内瑞拉首都加拉加斯的一则消息证实，美国已经向拉丁美洲国家政府就这项四点计划进行“试探”。这家通讯社援引“可靠人士”的话透露，美国在这项计划中再次倡议建立的泛美警察部队的主要矛头是针对着古巴。这些人士还说，拟议建立的政治委员会的任务是“研究共产主义对这个大陆的渗入”。如所周知，“反对共产主义渗入”一直是美国用来干涉古巴的拙劣借口。
    《革命报》说，某些拉丁美洲国家的政府表示，由于在大陆上可能引起人民的反对，它们对美国的这项计划有保留。但是，美国政府在它不断进行反对古巴革命的阴谋的过程中，并没有考虑这个因素。
