    Constantly Improve Thinking, Take Timely Measures
    Qingdao State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 5 Vigorously Conserves Raw Cotton
    (Our report) Qingdao State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 5, while achieving high-quality and high-yield production, has vigorously conserved cotton. From January to November, the entire factory saved more than 43,000 jin of raw cotton.
    Since the beginning of this year, the factory's Party committee has frequently conducted ideological education among workers on building the country through diligence and thrift, and increasing production and practicing economy. They have also adopted methods such as holding exhibitions on increasing production and practicing economy, and convening economic activity analysis meetings, so that cadres and workers firmly establish the concept of thrift. Especially since the fourth quarter, in view of the characteristics of new cotton entering the market, they have repeatedly carried out education focusing on agriculture as the foundation and the conservation of raw cotton. They calculated in detail how much cotton is used for a piece of yarn, how much land is needed to produce this cotton, and how much labor is required, making workers pay more attention to saving cotton.
    On the basis of constantly improving thinking, the factory distributed cotton usage quotas to workshops, work areas, and individuals on a quarterly and monthly basis, so that cotton waste indicators such as white cotton, bad yarn, and recycled silk were closely linked to the red flag competition. This made each workshop, work area, and worker clearly understand the specific requirements of their unit and themselves for completing the cotton usage target, making cotton conservation a mass effort, with everyone supervising each other.
    On the basis of mass participation in management, the factory systematically established and improved management systems. First, it established a system for the cotton cleaning workshop to conduct regular mass evaluation and appraisal of cotton waste from various machines, and to solve problems in a timely manner. Second, it established and improved the cotton waste equalization system. Due to frequent changes in raw cotton, it adopted a system of revising the target every ten days, dividing the area, and clarifying responsibilities. Third, it strengthened the accounting work of the work teams and adhered to the system of inventory every ten days. After each inventory, problems were analyzed and solved immediately. At the same time, the factory-level established a three-way combination team for saving cotton, which regularly went deep into the workshops to check the implementation of cotton conservation measures and management systems.
    The factory also strengthened technical measures for conserving cotton. They adhered to the cotton blending meeting system and the regular raw cotton inspection system. Every time there was a change in raw cotton, they convened cotton blending meetings attended by relevant cadres, veteran workers, and technicians. The testing and matching group conducted trial spinning in advance, and adjusted the technology in a timely manner according to the characteristics of the raw cotton, ensuring quality and meeting the requirements of cotton conservation.

    不断提高思想　及时采取措施
    青岛国棉五厂大力节约原棉
    本报讯　青岛市国棉五厂在取得优质高产的同时，大力节约用棉。全厂1至11月份，共节约原棉四万三千多斤。
    今年以来，这个厂党委经常不断地向职工进行勤俭建国和增产节约的思想教育，并采取举办增产节约展览会，召开经济活动分析会议等方法，使干部、职工牢固地树立起节约观念。尤其是第四季度以来，针对新棉上市的特点，又反复进行了以农业为基础和节约原棉的教育，并算了一件纱用多少棉花、这些棉花是多少土地的产量以及花费多少劳动力的细账，使职工更加重视了节约用棉。
    在不断提高思想的基础上，这个厂把用棉量按指标按季按月分别下达到车间、工区和个人，使落棉指标如白花、坏纱、回丝等紧紧和红旗竞赛相结合，这样使每个车间、工区和职工都明确本单位、本人完成用棉量的具体要求，使节约用棉成了群众性的工作，大家互相监督。
    在群众参加管理的基础上，这个厂又系统地建立健全了管理制度。首先建立了清花工段定期对各机落棉进行群众性评比鉴定的制度，发现问题及时解决。其次，建立与健全落棉均衡制度，由于原棉变动频繁就采取了每旬指标一修订，划分了区域，明确责任。再次，是加强班组核算工作，坚持每旬盘存的制度，每次盘存后发现问题进行分析立即解决。同时，厂一级成立了节约用棉的三结合小组，经常深入车间检查节约用棉措施和管理制度执行情况。
    这个厂还加强了节约用棉的技术措施。他们坚持了混棉会议制度和定期的原棉巡视制度，每次原棉变动都召开有关干部、老工人、技术人员参加的混棉会议，预先由验配组进行试纺，根据原棉特点及时调整工艺，既保证质量又符合节约用棉要求。
