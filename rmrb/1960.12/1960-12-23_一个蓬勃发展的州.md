    A Thriving State
    By our correspondent Wei Lingbing
    Craiova Region is located in southern Romania, bordering the Carpathian Mountains to the north and the Danube River to the south, with the famous Olt Plain in between. We recently visited this state, known as the "granary."
    Before liberation, Craiova Region, with more than 1.2 million residents, was the most populous state in Romania, but it was very backward in terms of economy and culture. At that time, industry consisted of less than one hundred repair shops and small workshops; more than one-third of the farmers used wooden plows to cultivate the land; there were 600,000 illiterate people in the state; 100,000 people suffered from malnutrition; and the infant mortality rate was the highest in the country.
    In the era of people's power, thanks to the implementation of the Party's policy of developing economically backward areas, and the efforts of the working people of the whole state, Craiova Region has greatly changed its past backwardness.
    The industrial production of Craiova Region is developing rapidly at a rate faster than the national industrial growth. This year, compared with 1938, the national industrial production will increase fourfold, while the industrial production of this state will increase 7.7 times. Now, Craiova Region has become one of the important industrial areas of Romania. Various ships manufactured here sail on inland rivers and along the coast, newly produced diesel locomotives speed across the land, and generators produced provide power to many factories. The state has newly built the largest mechanized sugar refinery in the country, the largest wood processing complex in the country; and has also newly opened the only open-pit coal mine in the country, an oil mine accounting for a quarter of the country's output, and an oil well gas mine accounting for a third of the country's output. The number of employees in the state has increased from more than 5,000 before liberation to more than 38,000 at present.
    The "Power" factory in Craiova Region is one of Romania's modern large-scale machine manufacturing plants, producing a series of power and transportation equipment such as generators, motors, transformers, streetcars, mining locomotives, and diesel locomotives. Now the value of the annual output of this factory is equal to the total industrial output value of the entire state in 1938. The state's modern wood processing complex is one of the largest of its kind in Southeast Europe, including five factories producing plywood, pressed boards, flooring, construction timber, and furniture. It processes 90,000 cubic meters of wood annually, with an annual output value of 500 million lei (Romanian currency).
    Craiova Region has developed agriculture and abundant underground resources, creating favorable conditions for the continuous and rapid development of industry. During the Six-Year Plan (1960-1965), the number of employees in this state will more than double, and industrial output will increase threefold. A large petrochemical complex, a powerful thermal power plant, and many other industrial enterprises will be built here. This state, formerly known as an "agricultural area," will become an increasingly prosperous industrial and agricultural state.
    While industry is developing rapidly, agriculture in Craiova Region has also made great progress. Before liberation, although the state's economy was mainly based on agriculture, the material and technical conditions and farming methods of agriculture were very backward. Under the cruel exploitation of feudal aristocrats and landlords, the vast majority of farmers lived a life of suffering. Since 1950, the farmers of this state have embarked on the road of agricultural collectivization. So far, more than 80% of the farmers in the state have joined collective farms, agricultural production cooperatives, and mutual cultivation societies. Collective farms have generally been consolidated organizationally and economically. This year, compared with 1955, the total amount of public accumulation funds of collective farms in the state has increased fivefold, and the daily wage for labor has increased by about onefold.
    In order to promote the development of socialist agriculture, Craiova Region has successively established eighteen machine tractor stations. Compared with 1950, the number of tractors in the state has increased by about threefold, the number of seeders has increased by about twentyfold, and the number of grain combine harvesters has increased from nine to one thousand and forty-five. In 1961, more than 1,200 tractors and more than 1,700 seeders will be added. The state continues to send agricultural technical cadres to support the agricultural construction of this state. The Agricultural College established in this state after liberation has had more than 1,500 graduates who have embarked on the agricultural front.
    In recent years, Craiova Region has made great achievements in water conservancy construction. In 1955, the irrigated area in the state was only several hundred hectares, but now it has reached 20,000 hectares. Agricultural workers in the state have also widely adopted many advanced agricultural technical measures such as deep plowing of land, increased application of fertilizers, and selection of fine varieties. From 1955 to 1957, the total grain output of Craiova Region ranked second among the sixteen states in the country every year, and in 1959 it jumped to the first place. This year, despite the poor natural conditions, many state farms and collective farms have still achieved very high yields. For example, at the "November 7th" State Farm we visited, the average yield of wheat per hectare this year was more than 2,700 kilograms, while last year it was only more than 2,600 kilograms. This farm achieved a net income of 3 million lei this year, exceeding the plan. Craiova Region has also paid attention to the development of animal husbandry in recent years. This year, the number of pigs, cattle, and sheep in the collective farms in Segaka County has increased by about onefold compared with last year. This year, the livestock income of the "Guerrilla" Collective Farm has increased by five and a half times compared with 1958. In 1961, the number of dairy cows in the collective farms of the whole state will increase by 64% compared with this year.
    With the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, the living standards of the working people in Craiova Region have been continuously improved, and cultural, educational, and health care undertakings have also made great progress. In 1944 before liberation, there was not a single institution of higher learning in the state, and there were only 800 middle school students, but now there are two institutions of higher learning, more than 14,000 middle school students, and illiteracy has long been eliminated. Now the number of doctors in the state has increased by twofold compared with 1938, and the number of medical staff has increased by fivefold. The natural population growth rate in the past decade has more than doubled.
    In the thriving Craiova Region, it is also not difficult to see vivid examples of the friendly relations and mutual assistance and cooperation between the Chinese and Romanian peoples. The workers of the "Power" factory have been manufacturing generators, transformers, and other products for our country for several years, and at the same time, the workers of this factory are using grinders manufactured by the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory. We saw coal miners wearing long rubber boots made by Chinese workers in the open-pit coal mine, and heard the Party committee secretary's praise for the Chinese students who were interning there in the oil area. The footprints of Chinese rice experts can be found in the rice fields on the banks of the Danube; and in the distant city of Beijing, guests from Craiova Region have also visited.

    一个蓬勃发展的州
    本报记者  魏凌冰
    克拉约瓦州位于罗马尼亚南部，北靠喀尔巴阡山，南临多瑙河，中间是著名的奥尔特平原。最近我们访问了这个被称为“谷仓”的州。
    在解放前，有一百二十多万居民的克拉约瓦州，是罗马尼亚的人口最多的州，但在经济和文化方面都非常落后。那时，工业只有不到一百家修理厂和小作坊；三分之一以上的农民使用木犁耕地；全州有六十万名文盲；十万人营养不良；婴儿死亡率占全国第一位。
    在人民政权年代里，由于执行了党的发展经济落后地区的政策，以及全州劳动人民的努力，克拉约瓦州大大改变了过去的落后面貌。
    克拉约瓦州的工业生产以快于全国工业增长的速度飞快发展。今年同1938年相比，全国工业生产将增长四倍，而这个州的工业生产将增长七点七倍。现在，克拉约瓦州已成为罗马尼亚的重要的工业区之一，这里制造的各种船只在内河和沿海航行，新出产的内燃机车在大地上奔驰，生产的发电机给许多工厂以动力。这个州新建了全国最大的机械化制糖厂，全国最大的木材加工联合厂；还新开辟了全国唯一的露天煤矿，占全国四分之一产量的石油矿和占全国三分之一产量的油井气矿。全州职工人数已从解放前的五千多人增加到目前的三万八千多人。
    克拉约瓦州的“电力”工厂是罗马尼亚的现代化大型机器制造厂之一，这里生产着发电机、电动机、变压器、电车、矿山车头、内燃机车一系列动力和交通设备。现在这个工厂每年生产的价值就等于1938年全州的工业产值。这个州的现代化木材加工联合厂是目前东南欧这类大型工厂中的一个，包括了生产胶合板、压制板、地板、建筑用材和家具的五个工厂，它每年要加工九万立方米木材，年产值达五亿列伊（罗币名）。
    克拉约瓦州有着发达的农业和丰富的地下资源，为工业的不断迅速发展创造了优越条件。在六年计划期间（1960—1965年）这个州的职工人数将增加一倍多，而工业产量将增加两倍。这里将兴建一个大型的石油化学联合厂，一个强大的火力发电站和许多其他工业企业。这个以前被称为“农业区”的州，将成为日益繁荣的工业农业州。
    在工业迅速发展的同时，克拉约瓦州的农业也有很大发展。在解放前，这个州的经济虽然以农业为主，但农业的物质技术条件和耕作方法都很落后。在封建贵族和地主残酷剥削下，广大农民过着痛苦生活。从1950年起，这个州的农民开始走上了农业合作化的道路，到目前为止，全州80％以上的农户已经参加了集体农庄、农业生产合作社和共耕社。集体农庄一般都在组织上和经济上获得了巩固。今年同1955年比较，全州集体农庄的公积金总数增加了五倍，劳动日报酬约增加了一倍。
    为了促进社会主义农业的发展，克拉约瓦州先后建立了十八个机器拖拉机站。同1950年相比，全州的拖拉机增加了约三倍，播种机约增加了二十倍，谷物联合收割机由九台增加到一千零四十五台。1961年还将增加一千二百多台拖拉机和一千七百多台播种机。国家不断派出农业技术干部支援这个州的农业建设。这个州在解放后成立的农学院已有一千五百多名毕业生走上了农业战线。
    最近几年来，克拉约瓦州在兴修水利方面有很大成绩，在1955年，全州灌溉面积只有数百公顷，而现在已达到两万公顷。这个州的农业劳动者还广泛采取了深耕土地，增施肥料，选用良种等许多先进的农业技术措施。从1955年到1957年，克拉约瓦州的粮食总产量在全国十六个州中每年都占第二位，而在1959年已跃居第一位，今年尽管自然条件不好，许多国营农场和集体农庄仍然取得了很高的产量，例如，在我们参观过的“11月7日”国营农场，今年平均每公顷小麦收了二千七百多公斤，而去年只收了二千六百多公斤。这个农场今年超计划获得了三百万列伊的纯收入。克拉约瓦州在最近一些年来也注意发展了畜牧业。今年塞加卡县集体农庄的猪、牛、羊头数比去年增加了一倍左右，今年“游击队员”集体农庄的畜牧收入比1958年增加了五倍半。1961年全州集体农庄的奶牛头数将比今年增加64％。
    随着工农业生产的迅速发展，克拉约瓦州劳动人民的生活水平不断提高，文化教育和卫生医疗事业也有巨大发展。在解放前的1944年，全州没有一所高等学校，中学生也只有八百名，而现在已有两所高等学校，中学生一万四千多名，文盲也早已没有了。现在全州医生人数比1938年增加了两倍，医务工作人员增加了五倍。近十年来的人口自然增长率提高了一倍以上。
    在蓬勃发展的克拉约瓦州，也不难看到中罗两国人民的友好联系和互助合作的生动事例。“电力”工厂的工人们几年来都在为我国制造着发电机、变压器等产品，同时这个工厂的工人又使用着上海机床厂制造的磨床。我们在露天煤矿看到采煤工人穿着中国工人制造的长统胶靴，在石油区听到党委书记对在那里实习的中国留学生的赞语。在多瑙河畔的稻田里可以找到中国水稻专家的足迹；而在遥远的北京城，也曾到过来自克拉约瓦州的客人。
