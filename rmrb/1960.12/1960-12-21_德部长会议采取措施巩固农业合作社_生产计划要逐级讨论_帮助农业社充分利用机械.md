Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 19th: The Press Bureau of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic announced on the 17th that, based on the recommendations of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party, it has decided to take a series of measures to increase commodity production and consolidate agricultural production cooperatives.

Among these measures, the most important is the formulation of production plans. The Presidium of the Council of Ministers decided that, in the future, the draft control figures for commodity production and livestock head numbers should be discussed at three levels: districts, counties, and townships. The Presidium of the Council of Ministers requires all agricultural production cooperatives to strive to exceed the requirements of the 1961 national economic plan and the production tasks for the early completion of the Seven-Year Plan when formulating their plans.

Another measure decided upon by the Presidium of the Council of Ministers is to continue to support agricultural production cooperatives. To encourage the full and rational use of agricultural machinery, tractors, whether belonging to Type III cooperatives (advanced cooperatives), Type I cooperatives (primary cooperatives), or used for cooperatives through contractual relationships, will receive government subsidies. The state will continue to provide subsidies or temporary loans to cooperatives with difficult production conditions, especially those in mountainous areas and areas with poor soil, next year.

The Presidium of the Council of Ministers also requested district, county, and township governments to formulate winter agricultural work plans based on the instructions of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.

The Presidium of the Council of Ministers also made corresponding provisions regarding agronomists and animal husbandry experts joining cooperatives as members, improving the treatment of veterinarians, and fixing tractor prices.

    德部长会议采取措施巩固农业合作社
    生产计划要逐级讨论　帮助农业社充分利用机械
    新华社柏林19日电　德意志民主共和国总理新闻局在17日发表的公告中说，德意志民主共和国部长会议主席团根据统一社会党中央政治局的建议，决定采取一系列措施，增加商品生产和巩固农业生产合作社。
    在这些措施中，最重要的是关于生产计划的制定工作。部长会议主席团决定，今后有关商品生产和牲畜饲养头数的控制数字草案要经专区、县和乡三级的讨论。部长会议主席团要求所有农业生产合作社在制定计划时应力求超过1961年国民经济计划以及提前完成七年计划的生产任务所提出的要求。
    部长会议主席团决定的另一项措施，是继续给农业生产合作社以支持。为鼓励充分合理地利用农业机械，不论属于三型社（高级社）、一型社（初级社）或经过合同关系而用于合作社的拖拉机都将得到政府的补助。对生产条件困难的合作社，特别是山区和土质不好地区的合作社，国家明年仍将给予补贴或临时贷款。
    部长会议主席团还要求专区、县、乡政府根据农林部的指示定出冬季农业工作计划。
    部长会议主席团还就农艺家和畜牧家参加合作社为社员、改善兽医待遇和固定拖拉机价格等方面做出相应规定。
