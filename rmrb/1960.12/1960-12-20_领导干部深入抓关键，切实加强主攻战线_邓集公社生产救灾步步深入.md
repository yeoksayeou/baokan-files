Leading Cadres Go Deep to Grasp the Key, Effectively Strengthen the Main Battle Line
Dengji Commune's Production and Disaster Relief Deepens Step by Step

(Reported by this newspaper) The people of Dengji Commune in Heze City, Shandong Province, who suffered a severe flood, have overcome numerous difficulties under the leadership of the Party and have achieved successive victories in the production and disaster relief movement.

First, they achieved victory in draining water and replanting crops, reducing some of the losses caused by the natural disaster. Immediately after the disaster, the entire commune estimated that the remaining grain crops could only yield 1.3 million jin; however, after draining water for replanting, strengthening management, and carefully harvesting in the autumn, the yield reached 3.8 million jin. Second, they overcame various difficulties and successfully completed the autumn sowing task, with most of the 30,000 mu of wheat having full and strong seedlings. Third, in accordance with the policy of production and disaster relief, the livelihood of commune members was arranged household by household, with grain, firewood, and vegetables arranged until the next summer harvest. Currently, the vast number of cadres and commune members here are full of confidence and actively engaged in winter production, determined to thoroughly overcome the disaster and strive for the continued leap forward in agricultural production next year.

The reason why Dengji Commune's production and disaster relief work has achieved successive victories is mainly because leaders at all levels have grasped the main links in production and disaster relief, and have led the people of the entire commune to rely on their own efforts, strive for progress, and overcome one difficulty after another on the road to advancement.

When disaster looms and difficulties arise, the ability of leading cadres to maintain a clear head and make calm and decisive decisions is the primary key to the success or failure of the struggle. In June and July, heavy rains fell continuously, and floods inundated large areas of crops, making the disaster a reality. The commune Party committee held an emergency meeting and unanimously agreed that draining water and replanting crops was the top priority and must be resolutely done well. Therefore, led by Wang Shouzhib, the first secretary of the commune Party committee, five secretaries went deep into Jianglou, Xilizhuang, Sunzhuang, Yangzhuang, and other production brigades with varying degrees of disaster to investigate and study. The investigation revealed that some highland crops had not been flooded; the water conservancy projects built after the communization provided favorable conditions for drainage; and the common demand of the masses was to drain water and replant crops. Based on the above situation, a decisive decision was made to regard draining water and replanting crops as the first important link in production and disaster relief, and a mass struggle was rapidly launched throughout the commune, achieving victory in draining water and replanting crops. Once the overall situation of autumn production was determined, in accordance with the instructions of the higher Party committee, they promptly proposed the call for careful harvesting, repeated harvesting, no grain to be lost, and no leaf to be discarded, and launched a careful harvesting movement. At the same time, leading cadres at all levels went deep down to inspect and arrange living arrangements brigade by brigade, mess hall by mess hall, and household by household, educating commune members to rely on their own efforts and produce to overcome the famine. In this way, by effectively mastering the method of combining the implementation of the Party's guidelines and instructions with in-depth investigation and research, and by closely grasping and solving the main links such as draining water for replanting, autumn harvesting, wheat sowing, and arranging living arrangements, the smooth development of the production and disaster relief movement was promoted.

In order to break through key areas and drive the overall situation, the Dengji Commune Party Committee concentrated its main forces on grasping production and resisting disaster. First, it explored labor potential from all aspects and invested it in production and disaster resistance. Since the disaster, more than 3,000 non-agricultural production personnel, including administrative management personnel, some employees of various enterprises and institutions, mess hall cooks, and teachers and students of schools throughout the commune, have participated in the production and disaster resistance struggle, strengthening the force. Second, in terms of financial and material resources, in addition to the funds controlled by the commune, which were mainly used for production and disaster resistance, the material supply of other commercial departments, the production of commune-run factories, etc., were also uniformly arranged from the perspective of supporting production and disaster resistance. In this way, the material foundation for production and disaster resistance work was strengthened; with production and disaster resistance done well, other work would be driven forward.

In addition to correctly proposing tasks, the Dengji Commune Party Committee also led cadres to go deep into the practice of struggle in a down-to-earth manner, participate in the struggle, and lead the struggle. Since the disaster, four of the five secretaries of the commune Party committee have been fixed in the four production brigades with the most severe disasters: Xilizhuang, Jianglou, Sunzhuang, and Mazhuang, and one secretary has been fixed in the Yangzhuang brigade with a lighter disaster, each establishing its own base point; other cadres of the commune and cadres of the brigade and team also have their own positions, participating in the disaster resistance struggle on the one hand and leading the disaster resistance struggle on the other. Immediately after the disaster, some cadres and commune members developed a fear of difficulties and a dependence mentality, and they lacked confidence in the commune Party committee's proposal of draining water for replanting. What to do? Wang Shuzhib, the first secretary of the commune Party committee, and Zhang Daokui, the deputy secretary, aimed at this ideological situation and launched everyone to improve their understanding through recalling, comparing, and summarizing experiences and lessons at a meeting of small team leaders. Many people pointed out that after the disaster in 1957, Gao Guangqian, the captain of the Gaohe production team, led the masses to strive for progress and timely planted 100 mu of mung beans, 50 mu of buckwheat, 100 mu of soybeans, and 120 mu of vegetables, overcoming the famine through self-reliance; on the contrary, Zhao Wenxian, the captain of the Shiliupu production team, was frightened by the difficulties and neither planted grain nor vegetables, and as a result, he had to rely on the state to supply 30,000 jin of grain to overcome the famine. The sharp contrast educated everyone, and they unanimously proposed: "We must do it, we must struggle, living people cannot be frightened by dead difficulties, we must overcome difficulties." After the first rainstorm, the masses of the entire commune drained more than 30,000 mu of water, rescued more than 10,000 mu of crops, and at the same time replanted more than 20,000 mu of late autumn crops and vegetables. The second and third rainstorms again filled the low-lying fields and washed away the sown seeds and seedlings. They led the commune members to actively overcome the difficulty of seed shortage and replanted late autumn and autumn vegetables, and finally won a good harvest of late autumn grain and vegetables.

Although efforts have been made to reduce some of the losses caused by the disaster, there are still many difficulties in overcoming the long 200 days from autumn to the wheat harvest next year due to the severity of the disaster. Grain, firewood, money, and feed are all insufficient. In response to this situation, the commune Party committee decided that the secretary and members would take charge of the brigade, the brigade cadres would take charge of the team, and the team cadres would take charge of the household and individual, investigating and arranging the livelihood of commune members brigade by brigade and household by household. Zhang Daokui, the deputy secretary of the Party committee who lived in the Jianglou brigade, went directly to the Shaolou team, which was the most severely affected by the disaster. Originally, many people in this team believed that life would not be good and they could only rely on the state. After Zhang Daokui specifically helped the team cadres to educate all commune members on self-reliance and production for disaster relief, he let the masses come up with ideas and methods. After discussion, everyone came up with many ways to produce and provide disaster relief, and they had ways and energy. The next day, Shao Haiyu, the captain of this team, led fifteen commune members to pick up firewood and grass, picking up 15,000 jin of grass in twenty days. Han Jichao, a member of the Sunzhuang production team, initially believed that he could not solve the problem of living expenses such as buying grain and firewood. The cadres in the team helped him specifically make a plan, which not only solved the problem of eating and using, but also had a surplus.

The Commune Party Committee’s continuous summarization of work and continuous inspection and evaluation have also powerfully promoted the movement for production and disaster relief. They promptly conducted inspections and evaluations at each stage and when each task was accomplished, drawing on experiences and lessons, identifying problems, solving problems, and improving work. For example, in an inspection at the end of the autumn harvest, the Commune Party Committee discovered two problems in the Jianglou Brigade: First, some teams did not carry out careful repeated harvesting, and a lot of sweet potatoes and cabbages were lost; Second, some canteens had lax systems and did not count meals. Therefore, they addressed the problems and solved them, making arrangements brigade by brigade and household by household, and further improved the repeated harvesting and living arrangements. Through inspections and evaluations, a large number of pacesetters and models emerged, setting up banners and role models for the people of the entire Commune, and creating a competitive upsurge of learning, comparing, catching up, and helping among the broad masses of cadres and people, which boosted the movement for production and disaster relief in the entire Commune to an even higher level.

Recently, based on summarizing the previous work and with the spirit of both grasping the present and looking at the future, the Commune Party Committee has put forward a new plan, determined to completely overcome the disaster and strive for the continued leap forward in agricultural production next year. After in-depth mobilization of the masses, winter production has been initially launched. In order to manage the 30,000 mu of wheat fields, each team has generally established a professional team of about 20 people to collectively accumulate fertilizer and make fertilizer; at the same time, they are mobilizing commune members to accumulate fertilizer from household to household. Small-scale farmland capital construction projects have been carried out in conjunction with winter irrigation. In addition, an appropriate amount of labor has been organized to invest in sideline production. The cadres and commune members are becoming more and more motivated to save themselves through production, and their confidence in overcoming the disaster is becoming more and more sufficient.

    领导干部深入抓关键，切实加强主攻战线
    邓集公社生产救灾步步深入
    本报讯　遭受特大水灾的山东菏泽市邓集公社人民，在党的领导下，克服重重困难，在生产救灾运动中获得了节节胜利。
    首先是他们取得了排涝抢种的胜利，减少了自然灾害造成的一部分损失。刚刚受灾后，全公社估计留下来的粮食作物，仅能收一百三十万斤；但经过排水抢种、加强管理，加上秋收中的精收细收，结果收了三百八十万斤。其次，克服了种种困难，顺利地完成了秋种任务，三万亩小麦大都苗全苗旺。再次，逐队逐户依据生产救灾的方针，安排了社员生活问题，粮、柴、菜等几项已经安排到明年夏收。目前，这里的广大干部、社员满怀信心地积极投入冬季生产，决心彻底战胜灾荒，争取明年农业生产的继续跃进。
    邓集公社的生产救灾工作，所以能够取得节节胜利，主要是由于各级领导干部抓住了生产救灾中的主要环节，并带领全社人民，自力更生，发愤图强，克服了挡在前进道路上的一个又一个的困难。
    当灾害压境，困难临头的时候，领导干部能不能保持清醒的头脑，沉着而果断地决策，是斗争胜败的首要关键。6、7月间，暴雨连降，洪水淹没了大片庄稼，灾情已成事实。公社党委召开了紧急会议，一致认为：排水抢种是当务之急，必须坚决做好。于是，以公社党委第一书记王守芝为首，五名书记冒雨深入姜楼、西李庄、孙庄、杨庄等几个灾情不同的大队调查研究。从调查中了解到：有一部分高地庄稼没有受淹；公社化后兴建的水利工程，为排水提供有利条件；群众的共同要求是排水抢种。基于上述情况，当机立断，决定把排水抢种当做生产救灾的头一个重要环节，在全社迅速开展了一个群众性的斗争，取得了排水抢种的胜利。秋季生产大局已定，根据上级党委的指示，他们及时提出了：精收细收，一收再收，粒粮不失，片叶不丢的号召，开展了精收细收运动。同时，各级领导干部深入下去，逐队、逐食堂、逐户检查安排生活，教育社员自力更生，生产度荒。就是这样，由于切实掌握了贯彻党的方针、指示和深入调查研究相结合的方法，紧紧抓住和解决了排水抢种、秋收、种麦、安排生活等主要环节，促进了生产救灾运动的顺利开展。
    为了突破关键带动全盘，邓集公社党委集中主要力量抓生产抗灾。首先从各方面挖掘劳动潜力，投入生产抗灾。自受灾以来，全社的行政管理人员、各企事业单位的一部分职工、食堂炊事员，以及学校的师生等非农业生产人员，有三千余人参加了生产抗灾斗争，壮大了力量。其次，在财力物力方面，除了社里掌握的资金，主要用于生产抗灾外，其他商业部门的物资供应、社办工厂的生产等等，也从支持生产抗灾出发，统一安排。这样一来，生产抗灾工作的物质基础就加强了；生产抗灾搞好了，其他工作也就带起来了。
    邓集公社党委除了正确提出任务以外，领导干部又踏踏实实地深入到斗争实践中去，参与斗争，领导斗争。从受灾以后，社党委的五名书记，有四名固定到西李庄、姜楼、孙庄、马庄四个灾情最重的生产大队，一名固定到灾情较轻的杨庄大队，分别建立了自己的基点；公社的其他干部和大队、小队的干部也都有自己的阵地，一面参加抗灾斗争，一面领导抗灾斗争。刚刚受灾，在一部分干部和社员中产生畏难情绪和依赖思想，他们对社党委提出的排水抢种信心不足。怎么办？社党委第一书记王守芝、副书记张道奎，针对这种思想状况，在一次小队长会上，发动大家通过回忆对比，总结经验教训，提高了认识。许多人提出：1957年受灾后，高河生产队队长高广乾领导群众发愤图强，及时种上了一百亩绿豆、五十亩荞麦、一百亩大豆、一百二十亩蔬菜，自力更生度过了荒年；相反，十里铺生产队队长赵文显，被困难吓倒了，既没种粮，又没种菜，结果只得依靠国家供应了三万斤粮，才度过了灾荒。鲜明的对比教育了大家，一致提出：“要干，要斗争，活人不能叫死困难吓倒，一定要战胜困难。”第一次暴雨后，全社群众排除了三万余亩积水，救出了一万余亩庄稼，同时改种了二万余亩晚秋作物和蔬菜。第二次、三次暴雨，又灌满了低洼的田野，冲没了播下的种子和幼芽，他们又领导社员积极地克服了缺种困难，再次种上了晚秋和秋菜，终于夺得了一个晚秋粮菜的好收成。
    尽管经过努力减轻了因灾造成的一部分损失，但是终因受灾严重，要度过从秋后到来年麦收漫长的二百天，还有不少困难，粮、柴、钱和饲草饲料都不足。针对这种情况，社党委决定，书记、委员包大队，大队干部包小队，小队干部包户包人，逐队逐户摸底打谱，安排好社员生活。住在姜楼大队的党委副书记张道奎，直接深入到灾情最重的邵楼小队。原来这个队不少人认为日子不好过，只有靠国家。张道奎具体帮小队干部向全体社员进行了自力更生，生产救灾教育后，放手发动群众出主意，想办法。经过讨论，大家提出了许多生产救灾的办法，有了门路也有了劲。第二天，这个小队队长邵海玉便带领十五名社员投入拾柴打草，二十天拾草一万五千斤。孙庄生产队社员韩继朝，开始认为自己没法解决购买粮、柴等的生活费用问题。队里的干部帮他具体打了谱，不仅可解决吃的用的，而且有余。
    社党委不断地总结工作，不断地检查评比，也有力地推动了生产救灾运动。他们在每个阶段，和每项任务实现时，都及时地进行检查评比，吸取经验教训，发现问题，解决问题，改进工作。例如在秋收末期的一次检查中，社党委在姜楼大队发现了两个问题：一是有的小队复收不细，地瓜、白菜丢失不少；二是有的食堂制度不严，吃饭无数。于是，对症下药，解决问题，逐队逐户地作了布置，进一步做好了复收和生活安排。经过检查评比，还涌现了大批标兵和模范，为全社人民树立了前进的旗帜和榜样，在广大干部和群众中掀起了学、比、赶、帮的竞赛热潮，使全社生产救灾运动一浪高一浪。
    最近社党委在总结前段工作的基础上，本着既抓当前又看明年的精神，又提出了新的计划，立志彻底战胜灾荒，争取明年农业生产继续跃进。经过深入发动群众，冬季生产已初步展开。为管好三万亩麦田，各小队普遍建立了二十人左右的专业队，集体积肥造肥；同时，发动社员户户积肥。结合冬浇进行了小型农田基本建设工程。此外，还组织了适当的劳力投入副业生产。干部和社员生产自救的干劲越来越大，战胜灾荒的信心越来越足。
