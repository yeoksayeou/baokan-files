The Tongfosi Production Team Launches Winter Production Campaign
Conscientiously Implement Policies, Give Full Play to the Production Enthusiasm of the Masses
Cadres and Masses Work Together to Accumulate Sufficient Fertilizer and Feed Livestock Well

(Our report) The Tongfosi Production Team of the Dapiying Brigade, Caiyu Commune, Daxing County, Beijing Municipality, conscientiously implements the Party's policies, presents the policies and tasks to the masses for discussion, and, based on the team's actual conditions, proposes specific measures for implementing the policies and tasks in a manner appropriate to local conditions. They regularly conduct inspections during the implementation process, thereby fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses, completing various production tasks, and overcoming this year's drought, resulting in an increase in the yield of major crops compared to last year.

The Tongfosi Production Team consists of thirty-one households, with 756 mu of cultivated land, sixty-two full and semi-able-bodied laborers, and sixteen head of livestock. Each laborer is responsible for a relatively large amount of cultivated land. The team's achievements in production this year are mainly due to the conscientious implementation of the Party's policies for rural people's communes. First, they resolutely implemented the policy of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, with 80% of the team's labor force consistently engaged on the agricultural front line. Second, in terms of labor management, they adhered to the implementation of quota management and contract responsibility systems, ensuring that everyone contributes their best and is compensated according to their work. Third, they ensured financial transparency with daily clearing and monthly settlements, keeping the commune members well-informed. Fourth, they managed the rural public canteen well, making practical arrangements for grain usage plans for the next seven to eight months, with appropriate care provided to the elderly, women, and pregnant women. Recently, in conjunction with various winter production activities, the team further examined the implementation of the Party's various policies, and, in conjunction with the examination, conducted publicity and made improvements. As a result, the commune members here are full of enthusiasm and have high production morale. Currently, after mobilizing the masses and discussing measures to strive for a bumper harvest throughout the coming year, the entire team has launched a winter production campaign centered on fertilizer accumulation, with cadres and commune members working together, accumulating fertilizer both collectively and individually. Although the team only has thirty-one households, they have already built thirty-nine manure circles. Now, all the commune members are taking advantage of the favorable situation and continuing to advance bravely, determined to improve their lives, accumulate sufficient fertilizer, and feed their livestock well, in order to fight a beautiful battle during next year's spring plowing.

How does the Tongfosi Production Team implement the Party's guidelines and policies? Their experience mainly includes the following:

First, policies must be shared with the masses, discussed conscientiously with the masses, their opinions analyzed, and methods formulated that conform to the specific conditions of the team.

After the cadres of this team receive the Party's guidelines, policies, and specific tasks, they first conscientiously study and comprehend the spirit, and then, based on the team's actual conditions and after discussion with the commune members, formulate implementation plans tailored to local conditions. The cadres of this team said: This experience was summarized from lessons learned, and therefore, the understanding is deepest. During the large-scale water conservancy project in Daxing in the spring of 1958, some team cadres advocated using the old wells on the lower slopes of the Luoguo area south of the village, repairing them, and digging ditches to divert water for irrigation. At the time, some people pointed out that the wells were low and the land was high, and that digging ditches would be useless; water could only be carried for irrigation, not diverted. The team cadres did not accept this opinion. As a result, a lot of effort was spent, but the benefits were not great. This incident educated the team cadres. Since then, they have paid special attention to investigation and research and proceeding from reality in every task.

Second, go deep among the masses, check the implementation of policies, discover problems, and solve them in a timely manner, which both promotes the work and further implements the policies.

The cadres of this team often pay attention to checking the implementation of each of the Party's policies. They mainly conduct inspections in two aspects: one is to focus on people, and the other is to focus on lines. Focusing on people mainly involves cadres befriending veteran farmers and poor and lower-middle peasants, and frequently listening to their opinions on the cadres' implementation of policies. Focusing on lines mainly involves the Party branch taking the lead, with the production captain, women's captain, livestock captain, Youth League branch, and canteen management committee each representing a line. By continuously checking the implementation of policies on each line, the team promotes all work.

They solve problems immediately when they are discovered during inspections. For a period of time, the implementation of quota management was not good enough in this team. After rectification, the team cadres constantly combined actual work with inspections of the implementation of this policy. During an inspection of animal husbandry work, some feeders reflected that while small-scale contracting was implemented for field production, the logistics department was still on a "fixed work schedule" and should be improved. After research, everyone agreed that this opinion was correct, and they promptly formulated labor quotas for feeders to release livestock and cooks to grow vegetables, further implementing the principle of distribution according to work, making the quota management system more and more reasonable.

Third, the implementation of policies should be combined with political education; the process of implementing policies is also a process of improving the masses' ideological awareness.

The cadres of this team deeply understand that better implementation of policies is actually strengthening the Party's leadership. Therefore, they always combine the implementation of policies with political education to improve the ideological awareness of the commune members and promote continuous development of production. When completing a work task, they always implement it on the basis of the majority of commune members reaching a consensus. At the beginning of selling surplus grain this year, some commune members were not very willing. The team cadres guided everyone to discuss: In 1957, our team lacked grain, and other places came to our aid. This year we have a bumper harvest, should we actively sell surplus grain to support disaster areas? Then, they calculated detailed accounts, posting the numbers of rations, seeds, and feed that had been weighed and stored in the warehouse on the walls of the canteen courtyard. Some commune members also visited the warehouse, giving them a clear understanding. Through recollection, accounting, and propaganda and education, the ideological awareness of the commune members was improved. When delivering grain, everyone was happy, helping with loading and transportation.

Fourth, cadres should become models for implementing various policies, take the lead in participating in labor, discuss matters with the masses, and accept the supervision of the masses.

The cadres of this team often eat, live, and work alongside the commune members, discussing matters with them, and humbly accept the opinions and supervision of the masses in the implementation of policies. Originally, the cadres of this team participated in labor very well, always working row by row with the commune members, but because they adopted a "weighted score system" (calculated according to average labor), some commune members had opinions. After discussion, the team cadres agreed that this opinion was correct and immediately changed the original method, recording work points based on labor.

    铜佛寺生产队开展冬季生产运动
    认真执行政策发挥群众生产积极性
    干部群众齐上阵积足肥料喂好牲口
    本报讯北京市郊大兴县采育公社大皮营大队铜佛寺生产队认真贯彻执行党的政策，把政策和任务交给群众讨论，根据本队实际情况，因地制宜地提出执行政策和任务的具体措施，在执行过程中经常进行检查，因而充分发挥了群众的积极性，完成了各项生产任务，战胜了今年的干旱，使主要农作物的产量比去年有所增加。
    铜佛寺生产队共三十一户，有耕地七百五十六亩，整半劳动力六十二名，牲畜十六头，每个劳动力平均负担的耕地比较多。他们今年在生产上取得这些成绩，主要是因为认真贯彻了党对农村人民公社的政策。首先，是坚决执行了大办农业、大办粮食的方针，全队经常有80％的劳动力在农业第一线。其次，在劳动管理方面，坚持实行了定额管理和包工责任制度，作到了各尽所能、按劳分配。第三，做到财务公开、日清月结，使社员心明眼亮。第四，办好农村公共食堂，把今后七、八个月的用粮计划作了切实的安排，老人、妇女和孕妇受到了适当的照顾。最近，这个小队又结合冬季各项生产，进一步检查了党的各项政策的执行情况，并且结合检查，随宣传，随改进。因此，这里的社员情绪饱满，生产干劲高涨。目前全队在发动群众，讨论了争取明年全年丰收的措施以后，已经展开以积肥为中心的冬季生产运动，干部、社员一起上阵，队积户积同时进行。虽然全队只有三十一户，可是现在光是圈肥就已经起了三十九圈。现在，全队社员正乘大好形势，继续奋勇前进，他们决心把生活搞好、把肥料积足、把牲畜喂好。在明年春耕生产时打一个漂亮仗。
    铜佛寺生产队是怎样贯彻执行党的方针政策的呢，他们的经验主要有以下几条：
    第一、要使政策和群众见面，认真同群众商量，分析群众的意见，订出符合本队具体条件的办法。
    这个队的干部在执行党的方针、政策和每次接受具体任务以后，首先是认真研究，领会精神，然后根据本队的实际情况，经过社员的讨论，作出因地制宜的执行计划。这个队的干部说：这条经验是从教训中总结出来的，因此，体会最深。在1958年春天大兴水利的时候，有的小队干部主张利用村南罗锅地下坡的旧井，重新修理，开出垅沟，引水浇地。当时有人提出井低地高，打垅沟没有用处，只能担水浇地，不能引水浇地。小队干部没有接受这个意见。结果费事不小，效益不大，通过这件事情，教育了小队干部。从此，他们在每项工作中都特别注意调查研究和从实际出发。
    第二、深入群众，检查政策的执行情况，发现问题，及时解决，既推动了工作，又进一步贯彻了政策。
    这个小队的干部经常注意检查党的每一项政策的执行情况。他们主要是从两方面进行检查的：一是抓人，二是抓线。抓人，主要是干部和老农、贫雇农交朋友，经常听取他们对于干部贯彻政策的意见。抓线，主要是党支部来抓，生产队长、妇女队长、畜牧队长、团支部、食堂管理委员会这几个方面各算一条线。通过不断检查各条线的政策执行情况，推动全部工作。
    他们在检查工作当中，发现了问题，马上解决。这个队在有一段时期，定额管理坚持得不够好，在经过整顿以后，小队干部不断结合实际工作检查这项政策的执行情况，在检查饲养工作时，有的饲养员反映：大田生产实行了小包工，可是后勤部门还是“卯子工”，应该改进。经过研究，大家认为这个意见正确，他们就及时订出了饲养员出圈和炊事员种菜的劳动定额，进一步贯彻了按劳分配的原则，使定额管理制度越来越合理。
    第三、贯彻政策要和政治教育结合起来进行，贯彻政策的过程，也正是提高群众思想觉悟的过程。
    这个队的干部深深体会到：更好地贯彻政策，实际上就是加强党的领导。因此，他们总是把贯彻政策和政治教育结合起来，提高社员思想觉悟，促进生产不断发展。他们在完成一项工作任务当中，总是在绝大部分社员认识一致的基础上执行。在今年卖余粮的时候，开始，有的社员不太乐意。队干部就引导大家讨论：1957年本队缺粮，别的地方也来支援，今年我们丰收，应不应该积极卖余粮，支援受灾区？接着，他们又算了细账，把经过过秤入仓的口粮、种子和饲料的留存数字，都贴在了食堂院里的壁上，有的社员还参观了仓库，使社员有底。经过回忆、算账和宣传教育，提高了社员的思想觉悟。送粮的时候，大家欢天喜地，帮助装车拉运。
    第四、干部要成为执行各项政策的模范，带头参加劳动，遇事同群众商量，并接受群众的监督。
    这个队的干部经常和社员同吃、同住、同劳动、遇事同商量，在贯彻政策当中，干部虚心接受群众的意见和监督。原来这个小队的干部参加劳动很好，总是和社员们一垅对一垅地干，可是因为采取的是“挂分制”（按中等劳力计算），个别社员有意见。小队干部们经过商量，认为这个意见正确，马上就改变了原来的办法，按劳动记工分。
