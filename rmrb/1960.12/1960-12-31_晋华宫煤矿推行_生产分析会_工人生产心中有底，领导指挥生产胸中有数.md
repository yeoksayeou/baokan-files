    Jinhuagong Coal Mine Promotes "Production Analysis Meeting"
    Workers Know Production Well, Leaders Have a Clear Picture of Production Command
    (Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 30th) The Jinhuagong Coal Mine of the Datong Mining Bureau completed its annual raw coal production plan on December 1st, increasing raw coal production by more than double compared to last year.
    Since the beginning of this year, the Jinhuagong Coal Mine Party Committee has institutionalized the practice of analyzing and studying production with workers in the form of "Production Analysis Meetings." These meetings have been established from the mine level to the wellhead, and from the wellhead to the team level. Each meeting is attended by leading cadres, engineering technicians, and veteran workers, who fully express their opinions. Through these analysis meetings, seven major production bottlenecks have been resolved, powerfully guaranteeing the soaring raw coal output.
    Through the "Production Analysis Meeting," this mine has institutionalized and regularized worker participation in production management. As a result, democratic style has been greatly promoted in production command. When deploying production each quarter, month, and ten-day period, they hold these "Production Analysis Meetings" at every level, mobilizing workers to analyze the production situation, study the weak links in production, and propose targeted measures, so that workers have a clear understanding of the production plan of the entire mine and their own unit, as well as the problems that should be paid attention to. In the 814 coal mining face of No. 1 Well, about 30% of the coal was lost from the coal entering the chute to the chute loading the cars. At the "Production Analysis Meeting" of the production team, the workers analyzed that the reason for the coal loss was that the speed of the four chutes was different. After the meeting, the gears were replaced, and the speed of the chutes was adjusted, eliminating the phenomenon of coal loss.
      The "Production Analysis Meeting" is not only a form for the masses to analyze and study production, but also an occasion for workers to conduct self-education. Since the beginning of this year, the entire mine has held several large-scale analysis meetings for "consultation" on many major issues, with very good results. Two coal mining faces in No. 2 Well used one belt conveyor. Because the conveyor often had accidents, it greatly affected monthly output and was a major bottleneck in the mine's production. However, there were two different opinions on how to solve the problem at the "Production Analysis Meeting" at the wellhead. The mine Party Committee then convened a large-scale "Production Analysis Meeting" attended by leading cadres, technical personnel, and veteran workers from the entire mine for "consultation." The "consultation" resulted in a unified understanding, the conveyor was reinstalled, and a segmented management system was formulated, finally eliminating the accidents and increasing the daily raw coal production level of this well by more than 40%.
    After the "Production Analysis Meeting" was institutionalized, many hidden dangers that were not noticed were discovered in a timely manner, enabling leaders to have a clear picture of production, and ensuring that measures were practical. As a result, the initiative in production command was won, and production continued to leap to new levels wave after wave. In early November, the daily raw coal production level of the entire mine reached 2,573 tons, exceeding the national planned target, and a continuous leap forward appeared following October. At the "Production Analysis Meeting," the workers conscientiously summarized the experience of high production, and also raised issues such as the large number of damaged coal cars and the slow repair and replacement, which would affect production, promptly reminding the wellhead leaders. They immediately assigned special personnel to rush repair fifty coal cars and immediately put them into production. By mid-November, the output soared to 3,063 tons, creating the highest record for the average ten-day output of the year, a sharp increase of 19% compared to the first ten days of the month. These facts not only promptly reminded the leaders, but also overcame the complacency of some employees and maintained a vigorous drive.

### 晋华宫煤矿推行“生产分析会”  工人生产心中有底，领导指挥生产胸中有数

    晋华宫煤矿推行“生产分析会”
    工人生产心中有底，领导指挥生产胸中有数
    本报太原30日电　大同矿务局晋华宫煤矿，已于12月1日完成了全年原煤生产计划，比去年全年的原煤产量增加一倍以上。
    今年以来，晋华宫煤矿党委把同工人分析研究生产的作法，以“生产分析会”的形式固定下来，从矿到井口、从井口到队组，都建立了这种分析会。每次会议，都由领导干部、工程技术人员和老工人参加，充分发表意见。通过这种分析会，先后解决了七项重大生产关键，有力地保证了原煤产量扶摇直上。
    这个矿通过“生产分析会”，把工人参加生产管理制度化、经常化了，因而在指挥生产中大大发扬了民主作风。他们每季、每月、每旬在部署生产的时候，都层层举行这种“生产分析会”，发动工人分析生产形势，研究生产中的薄弱环节，提出针对性的措施，使工人对全矿及本单位的生产计划和应注意的问题，心中有底。一号井八一四回采工作面从煤进溜子到溜子装车，中间跑煤达30％左右，在生产队的“生产分析会”上，工人们分析的结果，认为跑煤原因是四部溜子转速不同，会后改换了齿轮，调整了溜子的转速，消灭了跑煤现象。
      “生产分析会”不仅是群众分析研究生产的一种形式，而且是工人进行自我教育的场合。今年以来，全矿曾对许多重大问题召开几次大型的分析会进行“会诊”，效果很好。二号井两个回采工作面使用一部皮带溜子，因为溜子常出事故，每月影响产量很大，是全矿生产中的一大关键。可是怎么解决，在井口的
  “生产分析会”上却有两种不同的意见，矿党委就召开了有全矿领导干部、技术人员和老工人参加的大型“生产分析会”进行“会诊”。“会诊”的结果，统一了认识，重新安装了溜子，制定了分段管理制度，终于消灭了事故，使这个井原煤日产水平猛增40％以上。
    “生产分析会”形成制度以后，使许多不为人们注意的隐患问题，被及时发现，使领导生产作到胸中有数，措施切合实际，因而赢得了指挥生产上的主动，使生产一浪接一浪地不断跃向新的水平。11月上旬，全矿原煤日产水平达到二千五百七十三吨，超过了国家计划指标，出现了继10月以来的连续跃进。“生产分析会”上，工人们认真总结了高产经验，同时也提出了煤车损坏多、修配慢会影响生产等问题，及时提醒了井口领导，随即确定专人抢修好煤车五十辆，并立即投入了生产。到中旬，产量又飞向了三千零六十三吨，创造了全年旬平均产量的最高纪录，比上旬猛增19％。这些事实，不仅及时提醒了领导，也克服了一部分职工的自满思想，保持了旺盛的干劲。
