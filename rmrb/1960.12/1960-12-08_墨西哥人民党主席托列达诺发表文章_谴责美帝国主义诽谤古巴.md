Xinhua News Agency, Mexico City, December 2nd: According to TASS, Mexican People's Socialist Party (People's Party) Chairman Toledano published an article in the Mexican magazine "Tiempo," refuting the vicious anti-Cuban propaganda of US imperialism.

	He wrote that the US government's frantic propaganda campaign "is chilling and evokes contempt." He attacked the US propaganda organs' baseless attacks on Cuba, and emphasized that the Cuban revolution has not exported its policies to other Latin American countries. He said that every country in the Latin American family has its own reasons for wanting to free itself from imperialism and will do so according to its own traditions, culture, and psychology, and it will surely find a way to achieve its goals.

	Toledano emphasized that Cuba is solving its own problems according to its own domestic conditions and has its own way of solving social problems.

	Toledano concluded by saying, let the news agencies and newspapers that serve US imperialism shout as they wish. Fortunately, the people of Latin America have long ignored this propaganda campaign. They know very well what they have to do and what their future goals are.

    墨西哥人民党主席托列达诺发表文章
    谴责美帝国主义诽谤古巴
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社墨西哥城2日讯：墨西哥人民社会党（人民党）主席托列达诺在墨西哥《时代周刊》上发表文章，驳斥美帝国主义的反古巴的恶毒宣传。
    他写道，美国政府疯狂的宣传运动“是令人齿冷的，它引起了蔑视”。他抨击了美国宣传机构对古巴所作的毫无根据的攻击后着重指出：古巴革命没有向其他拉丁美洲国家输出自己的政策。他说，拉丁美洲大家庭的每一个国家都有自己的渴望摆脱帝国主义的理由，并将根据自己的传统、自己的文化和心理这样做，它一定会找到达到自己目标的途径。
    托列达诺强调指出，古巴是根据自己国内的条件来解决自己的问题的，它有自己的解决社会问题的途径。
    托列达诺最后说，让为美帝国主义服务的通讯社和报纸愿意怎样叫嚣就怎样叫嚣。可喜的是拉丁美洲人民早就对这种宣传运动不加理睬了。他们清楚地知道他们要做些什么，他们的将来目标是什么。
