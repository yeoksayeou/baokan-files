Xinhua News Agency report: Workers at the Beijing Automobile Factory are working hard to repair machines, make tools, tackle key problems, and prepare semi-finished products, vibrantly welcoming next year's production.

In just over half a month, the factory's main equipment has been almost entirely inspected, and more than one-fifth of the machine tools that needed repair have been fixed. Workers preparing for the introduction of new products have, in recent months, continuously organized innovation campaigns centered on realizing modularization, and have prepared more than 700 sets of molds required for the small-batch production of new products. The vast majority of the 327 key quality issues for new products have now also been resolved.
