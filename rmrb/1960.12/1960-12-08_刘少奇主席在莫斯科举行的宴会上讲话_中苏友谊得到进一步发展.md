Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 7th: Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, and Head of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation, delivered a speech at a banquet held in Moscow today. The full text is as follows:

    Respected Comrade Brezhnev, dear comrades, friends:

    Our Chinese Party and Government Delegation, at the invitation of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Government, participated in the celebrations of the 43rd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution and conducted a friendly visit. We received a warm welcome and grand reception from the broad masses of the Soviet people and leading Party and government comrades in Moscow and other places, which deeply impressed us with the profound and sincere fraternal friendship of the Soviet people towards the Chinese people. Now that our visit is coming to an end, please allow me to express my heartfelt gratitude for the hospitality of the Soviet people and Soviet leaders.

    We came here with the desire to strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship. We are pleased that our friendship and unity have been further consolidated and developed. This great friendship of ours is eternal and unbreakable.

    We are pleased to see that the great Soviet people have achieved brilliant successes in the comprehensive construction of communism. The construction undertakings of our socialist camp countries have also achieved great development. We, together with the people of all countries in the world, have made unremitting efforts to safeguard world peace. I believe that as long as the peace-loving countries and people of the world unite and fight together, the cause of defending world peace will surely be victorious.

    Now, I propose a toast:

    To the great Soviet people!

    To the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people!

    To the unity of the socialist camp countries!

    To the friendship of the people of all countries and world peace!

    To the health of Comrade Khrushchev and other Soviet Party and government leaders!

    Cheers!
