    Art Sends Forth a Myriad of Fragrances
    New Year's Capital Stage
    To welcome the arrival of 1961, many performing arts groups in the capital have prepared a rich and colorful array of excellent programs, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, for the people of Beijing to enjoy during the New Year holiday.
    Drama
    ★ The China Youth Art Theatre will premiere a new play, "Long Spears in Hand," which sings the praises of "Everyone a Soldier, Combining Labor and Military Affairs" and reflects real-life struggles. The script is set against the backdrop of the continuous leap forward on the agricultural production front in 1960 and extols the Jianlu Mountain People's Commune—an old revolutionary base area—in the struggle between two lines during the large-scale development of militia and production construction. The play embodies the Party and Chairman Mao's principles of militia building, such as "Everyone a Soldier" and "Combining Labor and Military Affairs, with Labor as the Main Focus," through the implementation of the correct thinking represented by the commune Party secretary, Old Cai. A series of fierce struggles unfold against the right-leaning paralysis represented by the commune's deputy director, Wu Qingbo, as well as the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements colluding with paratrooper spies. This play reflects the significant role of militia organizations on the production front and in defending socialist construction. It makes people realize that even in an environment of peaceful construction, we must hold a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other, maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance at all times, and carry forward the fine traditions of the old revolutionary base areas. Today, in the midst of the Party's call for vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, every militiaman is not only a defender against enemy struggles but also a shock worker on the production front. This play is a collective creation of the China Youth Art Theatre, written by Duan Chengbin.
    ★ "The Miser" by Molière, performed by the Beijing People's Art Theatre, and "The Servant of Two Masters" by Goldoni, performed by the Central Academy of Drama Experimental Theatre, are two satirical comedies with different styles and characteristics.
    ★ The beautiful fairy tale drama "Malan Flower," performed by the China Children's Theatre, is a favorite of young children, who will further recognize the glory of labor through the characters of Malan Flower and Xiao Lan.
    Opera
    ★ The Beijing Opera School Experimental Beijing Opera Troupe's recently rehearsed large-scale historical drama "Soaring Phoenix" is a fragment from "The Generals of the Yang Family," depicting the story of Yang Paifeng overcoming numerous repressions and bravely defeating the enemy. The entire play emphasizes singing, recitation, acting, and acrobatics, with a winding and humorous plot. The actors are all graduates of the Beijing Opera School, with a well-organized performance lineup. The main role of Yang Paifeng is played by Li Yufu, She Taijun by Wang Xiaolin, and Kou Zhun by Li Chongshan.
    ★ The China Peking Opera Theatre's Group One, returning from performance tours in Latin America and North America, as well as other troupes, will perform excellent repertoire such as "The White-Haired Girl" and "She Saihua." The Northern Kunqu Opera Theatre will also present popular Kunqu programs such as "Red Glow," "Zhongshan Wolf," "A Thousand Li Escorting Jingniang," and the students' class's "Leifeng Pagoda," starring Hou Yongkui, Li Shujun, and others.
    ★ The Beijing Yue Opera Troupe is performing several comedies with different characteristics, such as the large-scale drama "Three Looks at the Imperial Sister," excerpts from "Choosing a Son-in-Law," "Beating the Golden Branch," and "Pan Fu," which will well satisfy Yue Opera audiences who love comedies.
    ★ In addition to performing the popular revolutionary historical drama "Bitter Herbs," the China Pingju Theatre has arranged excerpts for the morning and daytime performances. Among them are the Xilu Pingju "Huating Meeting" and "Three Daughters Eliminating Tyrants," with their impassioned and unique singing styles; "Du Shiniang," which has been processed and reorganized based on tradition and absorbing the strengths of other schools; "Recognizing Mother in the Funeral Hall" and "Wellside Meeting," which are known for their singing; and "Happy Return" and "Little Borrowing Year," which excel in acting. In addition, Group One of the troupe will also go to the Liulihe Cement Plant to perform a door-to-door performance.
    Music and Dance
    ★ The Central Experimental Opera Theatre will once again perform the opera "Storm on the Yangtze River," written by our great musician Nie Er, which depicts the heroic struggle of Shanghai dockworkers, road workers, pile drivers, and brick workers before and after the "January 28th" Incident, who, regardless of the persecution of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary rule, united together. This opera has been warmly welcomed by audiences in the capital since its premiere. The opera troupe's dance drama touring group has concluded its performances in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Changsha, Wuhan, and other places, and during the New Year's Day period, it will premiere the national dance drama "Leifeng Pagoda," adapted from the beautiful fairy tale "The Legend of the White Snake," and the dance drama "Five Red Clouds," which depicts the heroic struggle of the Li people of Hainan Island under the leadership of the Party before liberation.
    ★ The Central Philharmonic Orchestra's symphony concert includes a group of Asian, African, and Latin American musical pieces, including folk dances and revolutionary music from Myanmar, Cambodia, Cuba, Brazil, Guinea, and other countries. There will also be Rimsky-Korsakov's "Capriccio Espagnol" as well as the symphony orchestra's repertoire "Mulan Taking Command" symphonic poem, "The Butterfly Lovers" violin concerto, and others. The orchestra's soloists and instrumentalists will go to factories, troops, and schools to perform door-to-door during the New Year holiday. On New Year's Eve, the orchestra's choir and soloists will perform for their old friends, the workers of the Second State Cotton Mill, and hold a get-together.
    ★ The joint performance of the Central Song and Dance Troupe and the Central National Orchestra includes a group of wonderful programs introducing Latin American music and dance art, in addition to the excellent repertoire of the two troupes, such as "Lotus Dance," "Red Ribbon Dance," "Yao Dance," and others. Among them are folk dances from Colombia and Cuba, as well as folk music from Cuba and Venezuela. The Cuban folk song "Gara Warley" is a famous black song depicting the Cuban people's resistance to Spanish colonialists eighty years ago, demanding freedom and liberation. From this work, we will feel the Cuban people's heroic fighting spirit.
    ★ The Central National Song and Dance Troupe's colorful Han "Flower Drum Dance," Mongolian "Lantern Dance," Tibetan "Reba on the Grassland," Uyghur "Tambourine Dance," Korean "Long Drum Dance," as well as chorus, instrumental ensemble, and other programs, are a good artistic enjoyment for the audience of the music and dance of our various ethnic groups.
    ★ The "Honghu Red Guards" performed by the China Railway Art Troupe Opera Troupe is a moving opera of revolutionary historical themes with a strong Hubei local flavor and profound educational significance. (Attached image)
