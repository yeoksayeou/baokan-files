This newspaper reports: Gansu Agricultural University, based on regional characteristics and the main problems in current production, has established "three-combination" base points of teaching, production labor, and scientific research in various agricultural and pastoral areas, which has both developed scientific theory and promoted agricultural and pastoral technology reform and production development.

Gansu Agricultural University was established in the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. In recent years, it has resolutely implemented the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, and has gradually established a new teaching order of "three-combination" of teaching, productive labor, and scientific research. In addition to running small factories such as farms, veterinary drug manufacturing plants, agricultural machinery plants, and pesticide and fertilizer plants on campus, in the spirit of "basing itself in Gansu and facing the whole country," it has established thirty-eight "three-combination" base points for teaching, productive labor, and scientific research in areas such as Dunhuang, Zhangye, Minqin, Wuwei, and Tianzhu, in response to the characteristics of Gansu's agricultural and pastoral development and the main problems existing in current production. It stipulates that all students participate in productive labor for three months a year to ensure that students can not only learn basic theoretical courses well, but also learn professional technical courses well in combination with practice.

In the past year or so, the school has dispatched 126 teachers to farms and base points, accounting for 51.6% of the total number of teachers in the school; 1,645 students, accounting for 87% of the total number of students in the school. After going to farms and base points, they shared weal and woe with workers, farmers, and herdsmen, studying diligently and working hard. For example, teachers and students of the Animal Husbandry Department, in the Wushaoling mountain nest in the Tianzhu pastoral area, not afraid of the cold, established a high-altitude grassland research station. When learning courses such as sheep breeding, horse breeding, and grassland science, they engaged in practical production with Tibetan herdsmen, such as herding sheep, raising lambs, medicinal baths, shearing, and herding horses, selecting seeds, and so on. They also carried out a number of scientific research projects in combination with practical production, such as the investigation of grassland types, livestock hybridization, and the prevention and control of livestock diseases. When the Feed Production Research Group lectured on "Grassland Types" in the Songshan Grassland of Tianzhu, they found that this grassland was different from the several grassland types in the books. They organized teachers and students to give full play to collective strength, on the one hand, extensively consulted relevant grassland materials at home and abroad; on the other hand, they went deep into pastoral areas and some agricultural areas to consult with the working people and conduct investigations and research, thus discovering a new grassland type—high-altitude arid grassland, creating a new "Grassland Science," compiling "Grassland Survey," revising the 800,000-word "Pasture Science," and holding training courses many times to train more than 200 grassland workers at all levels for the country. They also formulated technical measures for high-altitude grassland production and grassland zoning and rotational grazing programs through investigation and research, and tested them in the Honggeda Pastoral Production Team of Yongfeng Commune in Tianzhu County. The results of the trial operation increased pasture production by five times, expanded the grassland area by 15%, and increased the number of livestock in full condition from 41% in the past to more than 84%. At the same time, it improved the livestock breeding rate, survival rate, and production performance. This year, the school's original plan of more than 540 scientific research projects has been completed ahead of schedule. The achievements in one year have increased by 2.8 times compared with the scientific research projects completed by the Northwest Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine College, the predecessor of the school, in ten years. Teachers and students cooperated in compiling 124 kinds of teaching materials, of which 34 kinds, such as Grassland Science and Livestock Feeding Science, have been approved by the leading departments as textbooks for national universities. Through teachers and students going down, on-site teaching, carrying out productive labor and scientific research, a team of intellectuals who are both red and expert with the ideas of the working class is growing. The vast number of teachers and students have generally developed the noble qualities of diligence, thrift, and love of labor. Through on-site teaching, the close connection between theory and practice has also greatly improved the quality of teaching and promoted scientific research. In the first half of this year, more than 80% of the students in the school achieved excellent academic results. The political and professional level of the teachers has also been greatly improved. The vast majority of the 192 young teaching assistants in the school have been able to independently undertake teaching and research tasks.

    本报讯　甘肃农业大学依据地区特点，和当前生产中的主要问题，在各类农牧地区建立教学、生产劳动和科学研究“三结合”基点，既发展了科学理论，又促进了农牧业技术改革和生产发展。
    甘肃农业大学是在大跃进的1958年建立的。几年来，坚决贯彻执行党的教育为无产阶级的政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，逐步建立了一套教学、生产劳动和科学研究“三结合”的新的教学秩序。除在校举办了农场、兽药制造厂、农业机械厂、农药化肥厂等小型工厂以外，本着“立足甘肃，面向全国”的精神，针对甘肃农牧业发展的特点和当前生产中存在的主要问题，在敦煌、张掖、民勤、武威、天祝等地区建立了三十八个教学、生产劳动和科学研究的“三结合”基点，规定全校学生一年内参加生产劳动三个月，以保证学生既能学好基础理论课，又能结合实际学好专业技术课。
    一年多来，这个学校先后下放到农场、基点的教师有一百二十六名，占全校教师总数的51.6％；学生一千六百四十五名，占全校学生总数的87％。他们深入农场和基点后，就和工人、农牧民同甘共苦，勤学苦干。如畜牧系的师生，在天祝牧区乌鞘岭山窝里，不畏天寒地冻，建立了高山草原研究站。在学习养羊学、养马学和草原学等课程时，和藏族牧民一块放羊、育羔、药浴、剪毛和牧马、选种等实际生产，并结合生产实际，开展了草原类型的调查、牲畜杂交以及防治牲畜疫病等多项科学研究工作。饲料生产研究组在天祝松山草原讲授“草原类型”时，发现这个草原与书本上的几种草原类型都不一样，他们就组织师生，发挥集体力量，一面大量查阅国内外有关草原资料；一面深入牧区和部分农业区，向劳动人民请教，进行调查研究，从而发现了一个新的草原类型——高山干旱草原，创立了新的“草原学”，编好“草原调查”，修订了八十万字的“牧草学”，多次举办训练班，为国家培养出各级草原工作人员二百余名。他们还通过调查研究，制定了高山草原生产的技术措施和草原划区轮牧方案，在天祝县永丰公社红疙瘩牧业生产队试验。试办结果，使牧草产量提高了五倍，扩大草原面积15％，满膘牲畜由过去的41％提高到84％以上。同时，提高了牲畜繁殖率，成活率和生产性能。今年，学校原定的五百四十多项科学研究项目，已提前完成。一年的成绩，比该校前身的西北畜牧兽医学院十年完成的科学研究项目还增加了二点八倍。师生合作编写了一百二十四种教材，其中草原学、家畜饲养学等三十四种，已经领导部门审定作为全国高等院校教材出版。通过师生下放，现场教学，进行生产劳动和科学研究，一支具有工人阶级思想的又红又专的知识分子队伍正在成长。广大师生普遍养成了勤学俭朴，热爱劳动的高尚品德。通过现场教学，理论与实际密切联系，也大大地提高了教学质量和推动了科学研究工作。今年上半年全校有80％以上的学生学习成绩优良。教师的政治、业务水平也得到了很大提高，全校一百九十二名青年助教，绝大部分都已能独立地担负起教学研究任务。
