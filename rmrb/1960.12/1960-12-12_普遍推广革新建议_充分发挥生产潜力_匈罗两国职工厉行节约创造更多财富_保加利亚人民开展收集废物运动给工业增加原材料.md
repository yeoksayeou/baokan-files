Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 9th: Hungarian workers attach great importance to saving raw materials, fuel, and power, and fully exploiting the production potential of machines, striving to produce more wealth for the country with less consumption. Some advanced production units have achieved remarkable results in this regard.

The metallurgical workers are in the lead. The steelworkers of the Danube Iron and Steel Plant had already completed the annual savings target proposed at the beginning of the year in October, saving the country 20 million forints (the original target was 17.5 million forints). Now, they can save 17 kilograms of metal materials for every ton of steel produced, and the quality of the steel has also been greatly improved. In the first ten months of this year, the increased production due to the reduction of defective products alone was 1,000 tons of steel.

The open-hearth workshop of the Lenin Iron and Steel United Enterprise has taken many effective measures to reduce the production cost of steel, so that the materials needed to produce each ton of steel this year are 33 kilograms less than last year, and the cost is reduced by 120 forints. The young workers of the Ozde Iron and Steel United Plant originally planned to save 24.5 million forints for the whole year, but by the beginning of November, they had already over-saved 16.5 million forints.

In Hungary, workers regard saving electricity as an important task. Since the beginning of this year, aluminum smelters, which consume the most electricity, have greatly reduced their electricity consumption. For example, the Aika Aluminum Plant has reduced the electricity required to produce one ton of aluminum from 19,500 kilowatt-hours in the past to 17,400 kilowatt-hours this year, and the electricity saved is enough to meet the consumption of a medium-sized city. In addition, some enterprises are experimenting with using open-hearth furnaces to smelt steel that was previously smelted in electric furnaces, thereby saving a lot of electricity.

This year, power plants in various places have paid great attention to saving coal. So far, more than 150,000 tons of coal have been saved.

Workers in the light industry sector have also achieved great results. The ?erges Paper Mill originally planned to purchase a machine worth 6.5 million forints in order to increase production. However, thanks to the bold innovation proposals put forward by the workers, the production was increased by 50% under the original equipment conditions. In this way, not only was the 6.5 million forints for purchasing the machine saved, but also the annual output of the factory was increased from 400 tons to 600 tons. The workers of this factory completed the annual plan for this year two months ahead of schedule.

The workers of the Debrecen Furniture Factory pay attention to saving wood. In the first ten months of this year, they used waste materials to save the country 1.5 million forints. Now they have proposed to use waste materials to produce 200 sofas over the plan before the end of the year.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 9th: Romanian industrial and mining enterprise workers have achieved remarkable results in practicing thrift. Enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Ministry of Forestry Economy, and the Ministry of Consumer Goods Industry saved more than 400 million lei (Romanian currency) in the first three quarters of this year. Many enterprises have completed the annual savings plan.

In the steel industry, workers are striving to improve equipment utilization and reduce raw material consumption. The blast furnace utilization coefficient of the Galan "Victory" Factory increased by 9.8% compared with the plan, and the cost of each ton of pig iron decreased by 19.7 lei. This factory saved a total of more than 2.5 million lei in the first three quarters of this year. The steel consumption per ton of steel pipe in the Bucharest "Republic" Rolling Mill decreased by 23 kilograms compared with last year, and a total of 950 tons of steel was saved by the end of October.

In the machine manufacturing industry, workers widely improve product design, use substitutes, and save raw material consumption. The "May 1st" Petroleum Equipment Manufacturing Plant and the "Georgiu-Dej" Factory in Ploiesti saved a total of more than 5,000 tons of metal in the first three quarters of this year. After the "Red Flag" Factory in Stalin City adopted more than 60 innovation proposals to improve truck production this year, the metal consumption of each truck was reduced by 50 kilograms. The "Sower" Factory and the "Pliotiasa" Factory in Bucharest both use plastic instead of steel to manufacture steering wheels, battery casings, and other parts. The workers in the No. 1 Metallurgical Workshop of the "Sower" Factory completed the annual savings target by the end of October, and further proposed to guarantee to save another 160,000 lei before the end of the year.

Petroleum workers universally promote advanced working methods to improve labor productivity and reduce oil well costs. In September, turbine drilling accounted for 44% of the total drilling volume in the country. Some oil areas use small-diameter drilling, which can reduce the cost of each 800-meter oil well by 13%.

The workers in the consumer goods industry have made great efforts to increase product varieties, improve product quality, and reduce product costs. The savings performance of the footwear industry is even more outstanding. In the first three quarters of the year, the leather saved by the national shoe factories can make more than 360,000 pairs of leather shoes. The textile industry has also saved a lot of raw materials. The textile enterprises in Ploiesti alone have saved 10,000 kilograms of cotton yarn since this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia: Bulgaria's waste collection campaign has achieved remarkable results.

According to statistics from relevant departments in Bulgaria, in the first nine months of this year, the working people of Bulgaria collected a total of 59,267,476 kilograms of waste materials, which is 2,145,476 kilograms more than the waste collected in the whole year of 1959. The waste collected this year includes 37,061,400 kilograms of scrap steel, 2,071,300 kilograms of scrap iron, 3,365,850 kilograms of non-ferrous metals, and more than 11 million kilograms of waste paper.

Collecting waste materials has increased raw materials for industry and saved a lot of wealth for the country. This is a positive manifestation of the Bulgarian working people's participation in the country's socialist construction.

The waste collection campaign is led by the Bulgarian Fatherland Front, the Dimitrov Communist Youth League, and production cooperative organizations respectively. In the waste collection campaign, the broad masses of youth and residents showed a high degree of enthusiasm. The waste collected by the Dimitrov Communist Youth League members in the first nine months of this year was more than 222,300 kilograms more than the waste collected in the whole year of last year.

    普遍推广革新建议　充分发挥生产潜力
    匈罗两国职工厉行节约创造更多财富
    保加利亚人民开展收集废物运动给工业增加原材料
    新华社布达佩斯9日电　匈牙利广大职工很重视节约原料、燃料和动力，充分发挥机器的生产潜力，力求以更小的消耗，为国家增产更多的财富。一些先进的生产单位在这方面取得了显著的成绩。
    冶金工人走在前面。多瑙钢铁厂的炼钢工人早在10月就已完成了年初提出的全年节约指标，为国家节约了两千万福林（原来提出的指标是一千七百五十万福林）。现在他们每生产一吨钢可节约十七公斤的金属材料，钢的质量也有了很大的提高。在今年头十个月内，单由于减少废品就增产了一千吨钢。
    列宁钢铁联合企业的平炉车间在降低钢的生产成本方面采取了很多有效的措施，使今年生产每吨钢所需要的材料比去年减少了三十三公斤，成本降低了一百二十福林。奥兹德钢铁联合厂的青年职工们原计划全年节约二千四百五十万福林，到11月初他们就已经超额节约了一千六百五十万福林。
    在匈牙利，职工们把节约用电看做一项重要的任务。今年以来，消耗电最多的炼铝厂大大减少了电力的消费。例如，阿伊卡炼铝厂今年生产一吨铝所需要的电力已由过去的一万九千五百度减少到一万七千四百度，由此所节约下来的电力足够满足一个中等城市的消费。此外，一些企业正在试验用平炉来冶炼过去用电炉冶炼的钢，以此节约大量的电力。
    今年各地的发电站很注意节约用煤。到目前为止，已节约了十五万吨以上的煤。
    轻工业部门的职工也取得了很大成就。?尔盖什造纸厂为了提高产量，原订要购买一部价值六百五十万福林的机器。但是由于职工们大胆地提出了革新建议，使在原有设备的条件下就把生产提高了50％。这样，不仅节约了购买机器的六百五十万福林，而且把该厂的年产量由四百吨提高到六百吨。这个厂的职工们已提前两个月完成了今年全年的计划。
    德布勒森家具厂的职工注意节约木料。在今年头十个月中，他们利用废料为国家节约了一百五十万福林。现在他们又提出在年底以前利用废料来超计划生产二百张沙发。
    新华社布加勒斯特9日电　罗马尼亚工矿企业职工在厉行节约方面获得显著成绩。重工业部、林业经济部和消费品工业部所属企业在今年头三个季度中共节约了四亿多列伊（罗币）。许多企业已经完成全年节约计划。
    在钢铁工业中，工人们努力提高设备利用率和降低原材料消耗。加兰“胜利”工厂的高炉利用系数比计划提高了9.8％，每吨生铁的成本降低了十九点七列伊。这个工厂，在今年头三个季度中，共节约了二百五十多万列伊。布加勒斯特“共和国”轧管厂每吨钢管的用钢量比去年降低了二十三公斤，到10月底共节约了九百五十吨钢材。
    在机器制造业中，工人们广泛地改进产品设计，采用代用品，节省原材料的消耗。普罗什蒂州“五一”石油设备制造厂和“乔治乌—德治”工厂，在今年头三个季度中，共节约了五千多吨金属。斯大林城“红旗”工厂今年采用了六十多项改进卡车生产的革新建议以后，每辆卡车的金属消耗量降低了五十公斤。布加勒斯特“播种机”工厂和“普利奥蒂亚萨”工厂都用塑料代替钢材来制造方向盘、电瓶外壳等部件。“播种机”工厂一号冶金车间的工人在10月底就完成了全年节约指标，并且进一步提出保证到年底以前再节约十六万列伊。
    石油工人普遍推广先进工作法来提高劳动生产率和降低油井成本。9月份涡轮钻井已占全国总钻井量的44％。有些油区使用小口径钻井，可使每口八百米的油井成本降低13％。
    消费品工业的职工们，在增加产品种类、提高产品质量和降低产品成本方面作了很大努力。制鞋工业的节约成绩更为突出。全国制鞋厂，在头三个季度中，所节约的皮子能制三十六万多双皮鞋。纺织工业也节约了大量原材料。仅普罗什蒂州的纺织企业，今年以来，就已经节约了一万公斤棉纱。
    新华社索非亚讯　保加利亚收集废物运动取得显著成绩。
    据保加利亚有关部门统计，今年头九个月中，保加利亚全国劳动人民共收集了五千九百二十六万七千四百七十六公斤废弃物资，比1959年全年所收集的废物还要多二百一十四万五千四百七十六公斤。今年收集的废物中，有三千七百零六万一千四百公斤废钢，二百零七万一千三百公斤废铁，三百三十六万五千八百五十公斤有色金属，一千一百万公斤以上废纸。
    收集废弃物资，给工业增加了原料，为国家节约了大量的财富。这是保加利亚劳动人民参加国家社会主义建设的积极的表现。
    收集废物运动是由保加利亚的祖国阵线、季米特洛夫共青团和生产合作社组织分别领导进行的。在收集废物运动中，广大青年和居民表现了高度积极性。季米特洛夫共青团团员今年头九个月收集的废物，比去年全年所收集的废物还要多二十二万二千三百多公斤。（附图片）
