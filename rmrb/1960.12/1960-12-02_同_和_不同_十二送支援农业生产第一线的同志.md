    "Same" and "Different"
    -- Seeing Off Comrades Supporting Agricultural Production on the Front Lines
    Ge Song

    To be both "same" and yet "different" – this is the hope and the demand of the masses for the comrades going to the agricultural production front lines.

    Achieving "sameness" is crucial. Eating together, living together, working together, consulting with the masses on all matters – accomplishing these "four togethers" allows us to integrate with the masses in life, production, and thought. It allows us to promptly understand the demands and heartfelt wishes of the masses, and to understand new problems emerging in production and work. It also allows us to learn from and consult with the masses to solve problems. In a word: by achieving the "four togethers," we become true close friends with the masses, sharing joys and sorrows.

    But is it enough to simply achieve "sameness"? No, it is not. The Party requires cadres to play a greater leading role and do more work. The masses demand more from cadres: to lead them in improving production, to arrange their lives well, and also to do cultural education and hygiene work. They demand that cadres correctly implement the Party's policies and conduct socialist and communist propaganda and education work. In a word: they want the cadres to lead them, to be their "advisers" and "guides." This is what it means to be "different" in addition to being "same."

    "A snake cannot move without a head, a bird cannot fly without wings" - everything must have a head. To shoulder the heavy responsibility of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, we must have a head. We often say that we must play a "leading" role. The so-called "leading" means leading the masses forward. Comrades going to the agricultural production front lines have a responsibility to take the lead.

    To be "different," one must first achieve "sameness." "Sameness" is the foundation of "difference." "Difference" does not mean seeking special treatment and being incompatible with the masses in life, which should be opposed. "Difference" should mean standing higher than the masses politically and ideologically, seeing further, and being able to correctly lead the masses forward; taking the lead in all aspects of work, setting an example, and playing a core and backbone role; bearing hardship before others in life and enjoying comfort after others. To achieve these things, one must first integrate with the masses and be of one heart and one mind. Without the "four togethers," this "difference" will become water without a source, a tree without roots.

    First achieve "sameness," then achieve "difference"; first be students of the masses, then be teachers of the masses; come from the masses, go to the masses – this is the dialectic of our revolutionary work.

### “同”和“不同”——十二送支援农业生产第一线的同志

    “同”和“不同”
    ——十二送支援农业生产第一线的同志
    戈松
    既要“同”，又要有所“不同”，这是群众对于到农业生产第一线去的同志们的希望和要求。
    做到“同”很要紧。同吃，同住，同劳动，遇事同群众商量，这“四同”做到了，就能在生活上、生产上、思想上同群众打成一片，就能及时了解群众的要求和心声，了解生产和工作中新出现的问题，也就能向群众请教、学习，解决问题。一句话：做到了“四同”，我们就和群众成了真正的同甘苦、共患难的知心朋友。
    但是，只是做到了“同”够不够呢？不够。党要求干部能起更大的带头作用，能做更多的工作；群众要求干部能给他们更多的东西：领导他们搞好生产，把大家的生活安排好，还要做好文化教育和卫生等项工作；他们 要求干部正确地贯彻执行党的政策，进行社会主义和共产主义的宣传教育工作。一句话：要求干部们去领导他们，做好他们的“参谋”和“带路人”。这就是在“同”之外，还要有所“不同”。
    “蛇无头不行，鸟无翅不飞”，做每一件事都必须有一个头。要挑好大办农业、大办粮食的这副重担子，没有头是不行的。我们常说要起“带头”作用，所谓“带头”，就是要带领群众前进。到农业生产第一线去的同志，有责任把这个头带起来。
    要做到有所“不同”，首先必须做到“同”。“同”是“不同”的基础。“不同”，并不是闹特殊化，在生活上和群众格格不入，那是应该反对的。“不同”，应该是在政治上和思想上比群众站得高一些，看得远一些，要能正确地领导群众前进；在工作上处处带头，以身作则，起核心和骨干作用；在生活上吃苦在前，享受在后。做到这些，需要首先同群众打成一片，同心同德；离开了“四同”，这个“不同”就会成为无源之水，无本之木。
    先做到“同”，后做到“不同”；先做群众的学生，后做群众的先生；从群众中来，到群众中去，这就是我们革命工作的辩证法。
