Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, December 8th: Leading cadres of the No. 4 Workshop of the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, through going deep into production and leading production, have explored a set of experiences in strengthening the preparatory work for converter steelmaking. Since this workshop implemented this experience in September, the average daily output of steel has increased by 186% compared with the average from January to August, and increased by 53.4% in the first half of November compared with the same period in October. Various indicators such as steel ingot quality, converter furnace life, and pig iron consumption have all achieved an all-round leap forward.

The specific content of this experience is: In addition to ensuring the completion of the steel production task of the shift, each shift should also lift down an old converter, dismantle an old converter, clean an old furnace pit, build a new converter, and install a new converter for the next shift. This has become a system that everyone abides by. Since the fourth workshop implemented this system, it has ensured that each shift has enough furnaces for blowing, greatly increasing the turnover rate of converters. Previously, the entire workshop could only operate an average of one and a half furnaces per day, but now it has increased to two and a half to three. Moreover, due to the sufficient number of spare furnaces, the "small stoppages" of the past have been completely eliminated, increasing the converter operation rate by more than 20%.

The characteristic of converter steelmaking is that there are many links and the furnace life is short. A converter can generally only be blown for eight hours, and a new furnace must be replaced. Before the implementation of the new system, each shift, when grasping the shift work plan, often only focused on completing its own steel production task, neglecting production preparation work and creating production conditions for the next shift. As a result, the replacement of converters was not guaranteed, production was affected, and the enthusiasm of workers and the potential of equipment could not be fully utilized. After the Party General Branch Secretary of the fourth workshop went deep into the front line of production and discovered this situation, he held several general branch expansion meetings, meetings of cadres above the workshop director level, and worker symposiums to seriously study the causes of this phenomenon. Everyone unanimously believed that the main reason for this situation was the lack of effective measures in production management to "grasp blowing with one hand and preparation with the other." After everyone's discussion, the workshop leadership quickly formulated this measure in production management and earnestly implemented it from September. In order to ensure the implementation of the new system, they further strengthened the ideological education of employees, and explained the important significance of strengthening production preparation work for ensuring continuous converter steelmaking production through specific facts. The workshop Party General Branch also specifically designated a deputy workshop director and the production scheduling team leader to be responsible for supervising and inspecting the implementation of the three shifts every day, and posting the production tasks, lifting furnace, dismantling furnace, cleaning pit, building furnace, and installing furnace indicators for each shift every day, so that every worker knows the task of the current shift.

The implementation of the new system has effectively improved production management work, enabling each shift to grasp blowing with one hand and preparation for the next shift's production with the other, thus further promoting great collaboration between the three shifts. The workers of each shift carried forward the communist style of "leaving difficulties to themselves and providing convenience to others," and regarded creating conditions for the next shift as their glorious responsibility. Due to the mutual cooperation of the three shifts of workers, the workshop has now achieved two to three furnaces blowing in each shift, and two more furnaces on standby. This ensures high output for every shift in the entire workshop.

Currently, the Party Committee of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel No. 2 Steelmaking Plant has comprehensively summarized the "One-Five Operation System" experience of this workshop and officially incorporated it into the production management system for implementation throughout the plant, ensuring that the plant's steelmaking production continuously obtains high output.

### 上班为下班创造生产条件  马钢二炼钢厂四车间钢产量不断上升

    上班为下班创造生产条件
    马钢二炼钢厂四车间钢产量不断上升
    据新华社合肥8日电　马鞍山钢铁公司第二炼钢厂四车间的领导干部，通过深入生产、领导生产，摸索出一套加强转炉炼钢生产准备工作的经验。这个车间从9月份推行了这项经验以来，钢的平均日产量比1至8月份平均提高了186％，11月上中旬又比10月份同期提高53.4％；钢锭质量、转炉炉龄、生铁消耗等各项指标，都获得了全面跃进。
    这项经验的具体内容是：在一个班里除了保证完成本班产钢任务以外，还要给下一班吊下一只旧转炉、拆除一只旧转炉、清理一个旧炉坑、砌好一只新转炉、装好一只新转炉。并成为人人遵守的制度。第四车间自从推行了这一制度后，保证了每个班都有足够的炉子吹炼，大大提高了转炉的周转率。原来全车间平均每天只能开一个半炉子，现在已经提高到开两只半到三只。而且，由于备用炉子充分，根本消灭了过去的那种“小停产”现象，使转炉作业率提高20％以上。
    转炉炼钢的特点是环节多，炉龄短，一只转炉一般只能吹炼八小时就要有一个新炉子来接替。这个车间在未实行新制度以前，各班在抓班作业计划时，往往只顾完成本班产钢任务，忽视进行生产准备工作和为下一班创造生产条件。因此造成了转炉的接替得不到保证，生产受到影响，使工人的干劲和设备潜力得不到充分发挥。第四车间的党总支书记深入生产第一线发现这一情况后，连续几次召开总支扩大会、工长以上干部会和职工座谈会，认真研究了产生这一现象的原因。大家一致认为造成这种情况的主要原因，是在生产管理上缺乏“一手抓吹炼，一手抓准备”的有效措施。经过大家讨论，车间领导很快就在生产管理上研究制定了这项措施，并从9月份起就认真贯彻执行。为了保证新制度的贯彻，他们进一步加强了职工的思想教育，通过具体事实，说明加强生产准备工作对确保转炉炼钢连续生产的重要意义。车间党总支还专门指定一名车间副主任和生产调度组长，每天负责督促检查三个班的执行情况，把每天每班的生产任务和吊炉、拆炉、清坑、砌炉、装炉指标张贴出来，使每个工人对当班任务心中有数。
    新制度的实行，有效地改善了生产管理工作，使每班生产都做到了一手抓吹炼，一手抓下班生产准备工作，因此进一步促进了三班之间的大协作。各班职工发扬“把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人”的共产主义风格，都把为下班创造条件当作自己的光荣职责。由于三班工人互相协作，现在这个车间已经做到班班都有两只到三只炉子在吹炼，另有两只炉子备用。这就确保了全车间班班高产。
    目前，马钢第二炼钢厂党委已经全面总结了这个车间的“一五作业制”经验，并且正式纳入生产管理制度在全厂贯彻执行，保证全厂炼钢生产连续不断地获得高产。
