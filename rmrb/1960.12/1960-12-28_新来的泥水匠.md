　　This day, the old north wind howled, mixed with drizzle, chilling people to the bone. In the Hehewan Brigade of the Lanxi Commune in Yiyang County, Hunan Province, the commune members had taken a holiday and were each repairing their houses and doing household chores.

　　After breakfast, a 28-year-old youth, with a white towel wrapped around his head and a blue cloth apron tied around his waist, came to the second canteen of the Xiucai Dam Production Team. From afar, the commune members warmly called out, "Secretary, good morning! Hello, Secretary!" This person was Comrade Chen Zhichao, the Deputy Secretary of the Commune Party Committee. Smiling, he greeted the commune members and first walked into the home of poor peasant commune member Yang Yuxiu.

　　Yang Yuxiu was a 58-year-old woman, whose husband had died and whose son was working elsewhere. Chen Zhichao entered the house and asked with concern, "Aunt Yang, are you cold?" Yang Yuxiu was sitting by the bed, warming herself with a brazier. Seeing Chen Zhichao arrive, she exclaimed with joy, "Oh! A loved one has come! Please, come in and sit down!" Saying that, she busily got up to move a stool and turned to reach for a cigarette from beside her pillow. But by the time she took out the cigarette and looked back, the guest had already hurried away.

　　When he entered the house just now, he noticed that half of Yang's "thatched wall" was not plastered, and the old north wind was blowing in through the thatched cracks, making it very cold. He didn't have time to sit down, so he ran to the canteen to borrow a set of plastering tools, went barefoot, carried a load of mud, and started plastering the wall for Yang.

　　Aunt Yang was overjoyed and ran to the stove to boil water, saying, "It's so cold, and you're taking time out of your busy schedule to plaster the wall for me. The Party is truly closer than family!" Chen Zhichao rolled up his sleeves, grabbed a handful of mud with both hands and plastered it onto the wall hole, smiling and saying, "Your family is short of hands. We should help with this little thing!"

　　Chen Zhichao came from a poor peasant family, had farmed the land, and had worked as a plasterer. Despite his slender build, he could carry over a hundred catties on his shoulders when working, and he was skilled in everything: plastering walls, building walls, building stoves, and building houses… He spread his feet apart, waved his hands, and by the time Aunt Yang had boiled the water, he had plastered the wall hole smoothly and seamlessly.

　　While boiling water, Aunt Yang secretly put four eggs into the pot, added a little tea and salt. After plastering the wall, she earnestly said, "Secretary, you are as close to me as my own family! Eat these few tea-salt eggs!" Seeing Aunt Yang's enthusiasm, Chen Zhichao couldn't refuse outright, so he hurriedly walked to the stove and changed the subject, saying, "Look, this stove is leaking fire a bit! It's not easy to burn, is it?"

　　"That's right! The original firebox was built too big and too high, so it burns a lot of firewood. And now it's broken…" Aunt Yang recounted the flaws of this dilapidated mud brick stove.

　　"It doesn't matter, I'll help you build a new one." Chen Zhichao said, disregarding Aunt Yang's repeated objections, moved the small pot off the stove, extinguished the remaining fire, and quickly demolished the broken stove. He carried mud, laid bricks, and in a short while, built a single-pot stove.

　　Aunt Yang carefully inspected the new stove: the firebox was low, the firebox was small, and the stove opening even had a round hole for steaming bowls, which was very satisfactory. She was overjoyed and exclaimed loudly, "Good stove! Good stove!" She immediately brought a basin of hot water and said, "Secretary, quickly wash your hands clean and eat the tea-salt eggs." Chen Zhichao didn't have time to sit down, and while walking away, said, "I'll come next time, I have important things to do!"

　　Chen Zhichao walked with great interest towards the home of commune member Leng Yunmei. Leng Yunmei was a 70-year-old woman, whose husband had died and who had no children. She was pasting paper on the windows when she turned her head and saw Chen Zhichao walking barefoot towards her. She said with great heartache, "Secretary, it's so cold! Come and warm yourself by the fire, wash your feet!" Saying that, she busily handed over her brazier and struck a match to prepare to boil hot water. Chen Zhichao grabbed the old woman and said with a loud laugh, "It's not cold, it's not cold. I heard your house is a bit leaky!"

　　"It is." The old woman walked to the bed and pointed to several light-transmitting tiles on the roof, saying, "It's leaking here." Without saying a word, Chen Zhichao turned around, ran to the canteen, borrowed a long ladder, leaned it against the eaves of Leng's house, climbed onto the roof, and helped the old woman repair the leaks.

　　At this time, the north wind was howling, and it was especially cold on the high roof. Chen Zhichao's hands and feet were frozen numb, and his cheeks and earlobes were frozen red. He bent down, wiped his face, and continued to work.

　　Seeing Chen Zhichao repairing the house on this cold day, the old woman was so moved that she couldn't speak for a long time. She quickly scooped a ladle of water into the pot, boiled water, and planned to fry a pot of fragrant soybeans and brew a bowl of hot ginger-salt tea for Chen Zhichao. She was busy and happy, but when the old woman had done everything and went outside to take a look, she found no one on the roof, the leaks had been repaired, and the ladder had been moved away. The new mud plasterer had gone to help another family.

    新来的泥水匠
    胡本莹
    这天，呼呼的老北风夹着牛毛细雨，冷得人直打寒颤。湖南省益阳县兰溪公社的和合垸大队，社员们放了假，各自在家里修整住屋，做些家务活。
    吃过早饭，一个二十八岁的青年，头扎白毛巾，腰系蓝布围巾，来到秀才坝生产队第二食堂。社员们老远就亲热地喊：“书记早！书记好！”这人是公社党委副书记陈志超同志，他笑着和社员们打过招呼，首先走进贫农社员杨玉秀家。
    杨玉秀是个五十八岁的老大娘，老倌死了，儿子在外面工作。陈志超进屋就关切地问：“杨家翁妈，冷不冷呀？”杨玉秀正抱着烘炉子坐在床边烤火，见陈志超来了，喜得大声地喊：“哎呀！亲人来了！快请坐！”说着忙起身搬凳子，又转身到床头的枕边摸纸烟。可是等她拿出纸烟来回头看时，客人已经匆匆地走了。
    他在刚才进屋时，发现杨家有半截“茅腊墙”墙壁没有泥好，老北风从茅草缝里灌进来，怪冷的。他来不及落坐，就跑到食堂借一套泥水匠工具，打着赤脚，担一担泥巴，到杨家泥起墙来。
    杨家翁妈惊喜交集，跑到灶门口一边烧开水，一边说：“天这样冷，你忙里偷闲来给我泥墙，真是党比亲人还亲呀！”陈志超卷起衣袖，双手搂一把泥巴往墙洞上一糊，笑着说：“您家里缺人手，这点小事我们应该帮忙嘛！”
    陈志超出身于一个贫农家里，种过田，干过泥水匠活。别看他个子单单瘦瘦，但劳动起来，一担能挑百多斤，泥壁、砌墙、打灶、盖屋……门门里手。他叉开两只脚，舞动双手，等杨家翁妈把水烧开时，已把墙洞泥得光滑平整、丝风不透了。
    杨家翁妈烧开水时，瞒着陈志超，把四只鸡蛋放进锅里，加了点茶叶和盐。泥完壁，她殷切地说：“书记，你像我娘屋里的人一样亲呀！吃了这几只茶盐鸡蛋吧！”陈志超见杨家翁妈这么热情，也不好硬着拒绝，忙走到灶门口换过话题说：“看，这个灶有些漏火呀！不好烧吧？”
    “是嘛！原来的灶膛打大了，打高了，烧的柴火多。如今又烂了……”杨家翁妈数落着这个破烂泥砖小灶的毛病。
    “不要紧，我来帮您砌个新的。”陈志超说着，不顾杨家翁妈再三拦阻，搬开灶上的小锅，熄灭灶里的余火，几下就把烂灶拆掉了。他担了泥巴，垒好土砖，一阵工夫，就把个单锅小灶砌成了。
    杨家翁妈仔细察看了新灶：火膛矮，火膛小，灶口上还剐了个架蒸钵的圆洞，十分合意。他喜出望外，大声地夸赞说：“好灶！好灶！”她随即端一盆热水来，说：“书记，快把手洗干净，好吃茶盐鸡蛋。”陈志超哪有工夫落坐，边走边说：“等下次来吧，我还有要紧事哩！”
    陈志超兴致勃勃，向社员冷运梅的家走去。冷运梅是位七十岁的老妈妈，死了老倌，没有儿女。她正在用纸糊窗子，回头看见陈志超打着赤脚走来了，十分心疼地说：“书记，好冷啊！快来烤火、洗脚！”说着忙把自己的烘炉子递过去，又划燃火柴准备烧热水。陈志超一把扶住老妈妈，大声地笑着说：“不冷，不冷。听说您的屋有点漏吧！”
    “漏。”老妈妈走到床边，抬头指着屋顶上几处透光的瓦说：“就是这里漏。”陈志超二话没说，一转身跑到食堂里，借了张长楼梯，搭在冷家的房檐边，爬上屋顶，帮老妈妈修整漏缝。
    这时北风呼呼吼叫，高高的屋顶上格外寒冷。陈志超的手脚冻麻了，双颊和耳根子冻红了，他弯下腰，擦擦脸，继续干着。
    老妈妈见陈志超在这个冷天上房修屋，感动得好久说不出一句话来。她赶忙舀了瓢水放进锅里，一边烧水，一边盘算要给陈志超炒盆香豆子，泡碗滚热的姜盐茶。她高高兴兴地忙着，可是等这位老妈妈一切做好了，出去一看，发现屋上没有人，漏眼修好了，梯子也搬走了。新来的泥水匠又到别家帮忙去了。
