From our Tianjin Dispatch, December 10th: Workers at the Hebei Coal Mine Special Equipment Factory are concentrating their efforts on increasing the production of the coal miners' "eyes" – miners' lamps. To date, the factory has produced more than 130,000 high-quality, high-efficiency miners' lamps and more than 700,000 miners' lamp parts. This batch of miners' lamps has been continuously shipped to large coal mines such as Kailuan and Fengfeng.

In order to support coal miners in mining more coal, the factory's Party committee regularly educates workers on the importance of miner's lamp production, explaining that miner's lamps are essential items for workers underground, and their production is closely related to increased coal production. Under the Party's constant education, the factory, in order to speed up the production of miner's lamps, has adopted methods of concentrating technical forces and raw materials, ensuring that this product is completed on time with quality and quantity guaranteed.

In terms of manpower arrangement, all six workshops and more than 20 major types of workers throughout the factory who could produce miner's lamps accepted production tasks. Workshops also launched a "one equaling several" labor competition. Veteran worker Zhang Zhihua was energetic, making full use of working hours and improving the troweling technique, increasing daily production of lead plates from 400 to 800, being the first to achieve "one equaling two." Subsequently, workers throughout the factory followed suit, and within a month, 20% of the workers achieved "one equaling two." As work efficiency improved, miner's lamp production also rose steadily. The production of "Type 59" miner's lamps increased rapidly from over 100 in August to over 6,000 in November.

While increasing the production of miner's lamps, the factory also organized a three-way combination visiting group of workshop leaders, veteran workers, and technicians to go to Kailuan, Fengfeng, and other coal mines twice to solicit miners' opinions on the miner's lamps produced by the factory. When they found that some miner's lamps had shortcomings such as acid leakage, short lifespan, and short illumination time, they immediately rushed back to the factory and mobilized workers to improve them. In response to the shortcoming of acid leakage, the Miner's Lamp Workshop mobilized everyone to offer suggestions and organized implementation, quickly creating a sulfuric acid injector, accurately controlling the amount of acid injected, and quickly resolving the above defects. They also absorbed foreign experience and reformed the 18 components of the miner's lamp. The reformed new model miner's lamp has the characteristics of small size and light weight. Each miner's lamp saves half a kilogram of materials such as rubber and thin steel plates compared to the original. With this item alone, the raw materials saved from September to November can increase the production of 2,000 miner's lamps. The new model miner's lamp is sufficient for miners to use underground for more than ten hours. (Attached picture)

### 河北煤矿专用设备制造厂职工大力支援煤矿增产  十三万盏矿灯运往开滦等矿  七十多万件矿灯配件相继出厂

    河北煤矿专用设备制造厂职工大力支援煤矿增产
    十三万盏矿灯运往开滦等矿
    七十多万件矿灯配件相继出厂
    本报天津10日电　河北省煤矿专用设备制造厂职工，集中力量增产煤矿工人的“眼睛”——矿灯，到目前止，这个厂已生产质量好、效能高的矿灯十三万多盏，矿灯配件七十多万件。这批矿灯，已源源运往开滦、峰峰等大型煤矿。
    为了支援采煤工人多采煤，这个厂的党委经常注意教育职工重视矿灯的生产。并向工人们说明，矿灯是井下工人时刻不能离开的用品，矿灯生产与增产煤炭有着密切的关系。在党的经常教育下，这个厂为了加快矿灯的生产速度，曾采用集中使用技术力量和原料材料的办法，保证了这项产品按质按量按期完成。
    在人力安排方面，全厂六个车间、二十多个主要工种的工人，凡是能生产矿灯的，都接受了生产任务。各车间还开展了“一顶几”的劳动竞赛。老工人张之华干劲足，充分利用工时，改进了抹板技术，日产铅极板由四百片猛增到八百片，第一个实现了一顶二。接着，全厂工人群起追赶，在一个月的时间内，就有20％的工人达到了“一顶二”。工效提高以后，矿灯的产量也在节节上升。“59型”矿灯，8月份生产一百多盏，11月份迅速上升到六千多盏。
    在增产矿灯的同时，这个厂还组织了车间领导干部、老工人、技术人员的三结合访问小组，先后两次深入开滦、峰峰等煤矿，广泛地征求矿工对本厂生产矿灯的意见。当他们发现有一部分矿灯存在着漏酸水、寿命短、照明时间短的缺点后，立即赶回工厂发动工人针对这些问题进行改进。矿灯车间针对漏酸水的缺点，发动大家提建议，并组织实现，很快创制了硫酸注液器，准确控制了酸水装入量，使上述缺陷迅速获得解决。他们还吸取外地的经验，改革了矿灯的十八个部件。改革后的新型号矿灯具有体积小，重量轻的特点，每盏矿灯比原来节约橡胶、薄钢板等材料半公斤。仅此一项，9至11月节约的原材料就可增产矿灯二千盏。新型号矿灯足够矿工在井下使用十小时以上。（附图片）
