    "Hundred Flowers" Bamboo Products
    Walking into the workshop of Shanghai's Hundred Flowers Factory, a chorus of motors fills the air. Bamboo strips are fed into one end of the machines, only to emerge from the other, one strip split into many, the thick becoming thin. Male and female workers sit intently at their workbenches, and soon, one bamboo basket and bamboo hamper after another is completed.
    In the past, the Hundred Flowers Factory mainly produced various bamboo products for industrial use, such as coal baskets, dredges, bamboo ladders, and bamboo crates for packaging goods. To meet the growing needs of the people's livelihood, this factory has focused on manufacturing small daily-use bamboo products since May of this year. Having grown accustomed to making large industrial products, switching to small commodities with diverse varieties and designs required learning many new techniques. The workers invited experienced master craftsmen from the Five-Star Bamboo Products Factory, who were skilled in making small commodities, and humbly learned from them. Production was to take a Great Leap Forward, but manual labor was both slow and laborious. They went to fraternal factories to learn from their experiences in technological innovation, and upon returning, they combined these experiences with their own production characteristics to trial-produce native machine tools, achieving the mechanization and semi-mechanization of bamboo splitting, sawing, drawing, and scraping, which increased work efficiency many times over. Taking the weaving of rice-washing baskets as an example, the average daily output per person increased from three to nine. In October and November alone, they produced more than 140,000 pieces of over seventy varieties, including steamers and vegetable baskets. (Attached image)

    “百花”竹器
    走进上海百花厂的车间，一片马达声响，竹条从机器这一头插进去，又从那一头跳出来，一条劈成几条，粗的变成细的。男工女工坐在工作台上专心地操作，一会儿，一只只竹篮、竹箩就制成了。
    过去，百花厂主要生产工业上用的各种竹器，像煤箩、笆斗、竹梯、装商品的竹箱等等。为了满足人民生活日益增长的需要，今年5月份起，这个厂着重制造日用竹器小商品。做惯了大件工业用品，改做花色品种多样的小商品，许多技术得重新学。工人们请来五星竹器厂擅长制造小商品的老师傅，虚心向他学习。生产要大跃进，可是手工做既慢又费劲，他们便到兄弟厂学习技术革新经验，回来结合自己的生产特点试制土机床，实现了竹子劈、锯、抽、刮的机械化和半机械化，工效成倍提高。拿编制淘米箩来说，就从过去每人平均每天做三只提高到九只。10月和11月份，他们就做出了蒸笼、菜篮等七十多种、十四万多件。（附图片）
