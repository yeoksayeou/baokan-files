Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 28th. The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization announced that the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization Council will hold a special meeting in Cairo on January 21st and 22nd, 1961, to support the legitimate government of Lumumba and the Congolese people's struggle against imperialist interference and aggression.

The Secretariat announced this in a call to the Afro-Asian people to support the Congolese people. The call stated, "Patrice Lumumba, the head of the legitimate government of the Congo, has been arrested and imprisoned by the American imperialists and their servants, the chieftains of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Joseph Mobutu. This fact has greatly worsened the situation and seriously threatens not only the independence and unity of the Congo, but also the peace of Africa."

The call pointed out that in the face of this extremely serious situation, the United Nations, utilized by imperialism headed by the United States, has committed crimes of aggression against the Congolese people.

Due to the despicable conspiracies of imperialism and the collusion of UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, all efforts made by the Afro-Asian group within the United Nations to defend the unity and independence of the Congo have remained ineffective.

The call stated that the sacred responsibility of all peace-loving and freedom-loving people is to support with all their strength and in every way the demands of the broad masses of people around the world for imperialism to get out of the Congo and to support the legitimate government of Lumumba. "We must especially mobilize the people of Afro-Asian countries to actively help and support the legitimate government of Lumumba, currently represented by Mr. Gizenga, and the Congolese people's struggle against imperialist interference and aggression."

In the call, the Secretariat called on all Afro-Asian Solidarity Committees and affiliated organizations to strongly condemn the crimes of imperialism and to unite all national forces in their respective countries to support the just cause of the Congolese people, and to submit their specific recommendations on this issue at the special meeting of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization Council in order to ensure the rapid victory of the noble struggle being heroically waged by the Congolese people.

    亚非人民团结组织理事会将举行特别会议
    支持卢蒙巴合法政府和刚果人民斗争
    新华社开罗28日电　亚非人民团结组织书记处宣布，亚非人民团结组织理事会将在1961年1月21日和22日在开罗举行特别会议，以支持卢蒙巴合法政府和刚果人民反对帝国主义干涉和侵略的斗争。
    书记处在号召亚非人民声援刚果人民的呼吁书中宣布了这一点。呼吁书说，“刚果合法政府首脑帕特里斯·卢蒙巴已被美帝国主义者及其北大西洋公约组织同盟者的仆从、匪首约瑟夫·蒙博托逮捕并投入狱中。这一事实大大地使形势恶化了，并且不但使刚果的独立和统一，而且还使非洲的和平遭到严重威胁。”
    呼吁书指出，在这种极其严重的局势面前，被以美国为首的帝国主义所利用的联合国犯下了侵略刚果人民的罪行。
    由于帝国主义的卑鄙阴谋和联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的共谋，联合国内亚非集团为保卫刚果统一和独立所作的一切努力，仍然不能奏效。
    呼吁书说，所有爱好和平和自由的人的神圣责任是以全部力量和以一切方法支持全世界广大人民群众要帝国主义滚出刚果和支持卢蒙巴合法政府的要求。“我们必须特别动员亚非各国人民积极帮助和支持目前由基赞加先生所代表的卢蒙巴合法政府以及刚果人民反对帝国主义干涉和侵略的斗争。”
    书记处在呼吁书中号召所有的亚非团结委员会和所属组织强烈地谴责帝国主义的罪行和团结各自国内所有的民族力量支持刚果人民的正义事业，并在亚非人民团结组织理事会特别会议上提出它们对于这个问题的具体建议，以便保证刚果人民英勇进行的崇高斗争获得迅速胜利。
