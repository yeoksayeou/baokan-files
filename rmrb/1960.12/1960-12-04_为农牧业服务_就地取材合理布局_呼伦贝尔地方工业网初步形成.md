    Serving Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, Utilizing Local Materials and Rational Layout
    A Preliminary Formation of the Hulunbuir Local Industrial Network

    (By our reporter) Under the guidance of the Party's ideology of taking agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor, local industry in Hulunbuir League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, has experienced rapid development. Now, a complete local industrial system including iron and steel, coal, electricity, machinery, chemicals, textiles, and food has been initially formed, and many industrial products can already greatly support construction needs.

    In the past, industry in Hulunbuir League was almost non-existent. In recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, due to the Hulunbuir League Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's resolute implementation of the policy of "taking steel as the key link," "walking on two legs," and "local industry serving agricultural and animal husbandry production," and with full consideration of resource conditions and raw material producing areas, the rational layout adapted to local conditions has led to a new situation of rapid development in local industry. Over the past three years, an average of 1.2 new industrial enterprises have been put into production every day in the league. Last year, the total industrial output value increased from 57.6% of the total industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry output value in 1957 to 69.8%. In the first ten months of this year, the total industrial output value increased by 65.6% compared to the same period last year.

    Before 1958, the various agricultural and animal husbandry machines needed for agricultural and animal husbandry production in this league mainly relied on supplies from other places. This year, under the Party's call to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, local industry has focused on supporting agricultural and animal husbandry production and technical transformation, producing and supplying more than 50 kinds of agricultural and animal husbandry machines for agricultural and pastoral areas, totaling more than 574,000 units (pieces), which is more than twice the total number in 1959. At the same time, it also manufactured and repaired more than 300,000 units (pieces) of various small agricultural tools. The league's agricultural and animal husbandry production has basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization in spring plowing, summer weeding, threshing, and storing livestock fodder. At the same time, 87 machinery repair plants and iron-wood joint factories equipped with nearly 400 mechanical power equipment such as mechanical processing, forging, casting, and sand turning have been established in 104 agricultural, pastoral, and forestry people's communes throughout the league. Local industrial enterprises have also trained more than 1,700 technical workers in machinery, electrical engineering, dairy products, and other fields for commune industries. Now, many communes, management areas, and production teams have not only achieved the requirement of "major repairs not leaving the commune, minor repairs not leaving the team" for agricultural tools, but can also produce most of the agricultural and animal husbandry production machinery they need themselves.

    With the rapid development of local industry and commune industry, the variety of industrial products has also greatly increased. In 1958, there were only 61 kinds of products included in the national plan that could be produced in batches, but this year it has reached 193 kinds, of which 20 kinds were products that had never been produced before 1959. While increasing the variety of products, employees of various enterprises have taken effective measures to continuously improve and improve the quality of their products. The proportion of top-grade dairy products produced by mechanized production in Yakeshi and Hailar increased from 75% in January of this year to 93.4%. The quality of many products has reached the advanced domestic level. For example, Hulunbuir leather coats, leather jackets, butter, milk powder, casein, and other light industrial products have gained the reputation of "famous brands." The fragrant cowhide and leather shoes from Hailar Leather Factory have sold well in the domestic market, and the export volume has also increased year by year. (Attached Pictures)

    为农牧业服务　就地取材合理布局
    呼伦贝尔地方工业网初步形成
    本报讯　在党的以农业为基础，工业为主导的思想指引下，内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔盟地方工业，有了飞跃发展。现在，一个包括钢铁、煤炭、电力、机械、化工、纺织和食品等的完整的地方工业体系已经初步形成，许多工业产品已能大量支援建设需要。
    过去，呼伦贝尔盟的工业几乎是一个空白。近年来，特别是从1958年大跃进以来，由于中共呼伦贝尔盟委员会坚决地贯彻执行了以钢为纲、两条腿走路和地方工业为农牧业生产服务的方针，并充分照顾到资源条件和原料产地，因地制宜地合理布局，使地方工业出现了飞跃发展的新局面。三年来，全盟平均每天就有一点二个新的工业企业投入生产。去年工业总产值由1957年占工农牧业总产值的57.6％，上升到69.8％，今年头十个月的工业总产值，又比去年同期增长65.6％。
    1958年以前，这个盟农牧业生产所需要的各种机具，主要是依靠外地供应的。今年在党的大办农业，大办粮食的号召下，地方工业把支援农牧业生产和技术改造作为中心，生产和供应了农业区牧业区的各种农牧业机具达五十多种，共五十七万四千多台（件），为1959年总数的二倍多，同时还制造和修配各种小型农具三十多万台（件）。全盟农牧业生产在春耕、夏锄、脱粒和打贮牲畜饲草等方面，基本上实现了机械化和半机械化。同时，现在全盟一百零四个农牧林区人民公社，已建立起八十七个装配有机械加工和锻造、铸造、翻砂等近四百台机械动力设备的机械修配厂和铁木联合厂。各地方工业企业并为公社工业培养出机械、电工、乳品等各种技术工人一千七百多名。现在，许多公社、管理区、生产队，不仅实现了农具“大修不出社，小修不出队”的要求，并且还能自己生产所需要的大部分农牧业生产机具。
    随着地方工业和公社工业的飞跃发展，工业产品品种也有了很大的增加。1958年列入国家计划能够成批生产的产品仅有六十一种，而今年已达一百九十三种，其中有二十种是1959年以前从未生产过的产品。在增加产品品种的同时，各企业职工采取有效措施，不断改进和提高了产品的质量。牙克石、海拉尔两地机械化生产的乳制品，特级品从今年1月份的75％提高到93.4％。许多种产品质量已达到国内先进水平。如呼伦贝尔皮大衣、皮夹克、奶油、乳粉、酪胶等轻工业品，获得了“名牌”的声誉。海拉尔皮革厂的香牛皮、皮鞋已畅销国内市场，出口量也逐年增加。（附图片）
