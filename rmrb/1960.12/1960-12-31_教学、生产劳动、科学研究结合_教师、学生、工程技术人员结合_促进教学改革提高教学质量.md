Combining Teaching, Productive Labor, and Scientific Research; Integrating Teachers, Students, and Engineering Technicians
Promote Teaching Reform and Improve Teaching Quality
Taiyuan Institute of Technology's Industrial and Civil Architecture Department in Shanxi Province Achieves Great Success in Establishing a "Three-Combination" Base at Construction Sites
    This newspaper reports that the Industrial and Civil Architecture Department of the Civil Engineering Department of Taiyuan Institute of Technology resolutely implements the Party's educational policy, delves deeply into the Third Work Zone construction site of the Fifth Construction Company of Shanxi Province, and establishes a long-term and fixed "Three-Combination" base. It tightly combines teaching, productive labor, and scientific research; teachers, students, and workers; and schools, scientific research institutions, and production units. This has both promoted the school's teaching and scientific research work, enabling teachers and students to acquire genuine knowledge and transform their thinking, and has supported the construction site's production and construction, helping workers improve their cultural and knowledge levels.
    The Industrial and Civil Architecture Department of the Civil Engineering Department of Taiyuan Institute of Technology has established a "Three-Combination" relationship with the Third Work Zone construction site of the Fifth Construction Company of Shanxi Province since December 1958. Over the past two years, the forms and contents of the "Three-Combination" have continuously developed and improved. In the past, it was a sporadic combination between one grade, one construction teaching and research group, and one work team of the work zone; now it has developed into a long-term and fixed combination of all five grades, three teaching and research groups (construction, structure, architecture), and all workers of the work zone. In the past, only on-site teaching of one construction course and general productive labor were conducted; now it has developed into a comprehensive combination of comprehensive teaching, technical revolution, scientific research, and labor training in three courses: construction, structure, and architecture. In the past, teachers and students helped workers learn cultural and scientific knowledge without a plan; now they have assisted the work zone in establishing an amateur school for construction workers, systematically training a group of workers with specialized knowledge at the junior college level.
    In order to adapt to this new development situation, a set of organizational leadership structures corresponding to this has been established on the construction site. The Party branch, composed of Party member teachers and students, absorbs responsible comrades of the work zone's Party organization and some worker Party members to comprehensively lead the ideological, teaching, labor, technical revolution, and scientific research work of teachers and students. The "Three-Combination" teaching and research group, composed of teachers, student representatives, and designated workers and engineering technicians, is responsible for comprehensively leading the teaching work of teachers and students. In addition, the "Three-Combination" school affairs committee, composed of responsible comrades of the work zone, workers, and teacher and student representatives, comprehensively leads the teaching work of the workers' amateur school.
    After implementing the above "Three-Combination" measures, teaching reform was promoted, and teaching quality was effectively improved. The Party branch mobilized teachers, students, and engineering technicians to conduct free airing of views and debates, examined the phenomena of "less, slower, poorer, and more costly" that existed in past teaching, deleted repetitive, fragmented, outdated parts of the teaching materials, and added new content such as the Party's construction policies and the latest scientific achievements, especially absorbing the latest achievements of China's workers' technical revolution since 1958, which greatly helped establish a new system of construction engineering and engineering structure in our country. The courses they have compiled are undergoing key experiments in teaching. Among them, "Construction Engineering" has been published by the People's Education Publishing House. In the "Three-Combination", teaching methods have also been reformed. After the "Three-Combination" teaching and research group collectively prepares lessons, according to the content of the teaching materials and the strengths of each person, it adopts the method of teachers, workers, or students lecturing separately or jointly. For example, when students learn the chapters on bricklaying and painting, the workers will lecture and demonstrate on-site, and after the lecture, the students will conduct on-site practice. General theoretical issues are lectured by teachers. For chapters in the course that have both operational techniques and theories, workers and teachers will adopt a "duet" style of joint lectures. For example, when talking about welding technology, workers talk about the operation methods of welding, and teachers talk about the principles of welding; when talking about engineering structure, workers talk about the high-altitude operation of cranes, and teachers talk about the structure and operation principles of cranes. Sometimes students also give lectures. For example, students who have participated in the production and innovation of prestressed mandrels lecture on the production process, structure, and principles of prestressed mandrels. They speak vividly, concretely, and profoundly, and teachers and students praise them as "surpassing their teachers."
    Since this year, this major, on the basis of on-site teaching of one course, has further broken the boundaries and systems of courses and implemented comprehensive on-site teaching of several courses. This teaching method starts from the whole of a building, focusing on the relevant parts of each course for thematic report-style lectures. The results of key experiments have proved that this comprehensive teaching method not only reduces more than half of the class hours but also enables students to acquire complete and systematic knowledge and cultivates students' ability to comprehensively and dialectically observe problems and comprehensively solve engineering technical problems. After using new teaching materials and applying new teaching methods, the class hours are appropriately shortened, and the quality of teaching is improved. Students learn more, understand more deeply, remember more firmly, and use more flexibly.
    In labor and teaching, the teachers and students of this major also closely combine the key issues of construction site production, and together with the workers, launched a vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement, which powerfully promoted the school's scientific research and the construction site's production.
    In the "Three-Combination" process, teachers and students eat, live, work, and discuss with workers on the construction site, and are often influenced and educated by the working class's noble qualities of selflessness, selfless labor, love for the Party, and loyalty to socialism, and have generally strengthened their class viewpoint, labor viewpoint, and mass viewpoint, and improved their communist ideological awareness. With the help of teachers and students, the entire work zone has basically eliminated illiteracy, and the workers' cultural knowledge, scientific theory, and technical level have been generally improved, and they have received immediate results in production.

    教学、生产劳动、科学研究结合　教师、学生、工程技术人员结合
    促进教学改革提高教学质量
    山西太原工学院工业与民用建筑专业在建筑工地建立三结合基地取得很大成绩
    本报讯　太原工学院土木系工业与民用建筑专业，坚决贯彻党的教育方针，深入山西省建筑五公司三工区工地，建立长期固定的“三结合”基地，把教学、生产劳动和科学研究，教师、学生和工人，学校、科学研究机构和生产单位，紧密结合起来，既推动了学校的教学和科学研究工作，使师生学到真才实学，改造了思想；又支援了工地生产建设，帮助工人提高了文化知识水平。
    太原工学院土木系工业与民用建筑专业，从1958年12月开始，同山西省建筑五公司三工区工地建立了“三结合”关系。两年来，“三结合”的形式和内容不断发展，日臻完善。过去是一个年级、一个施工教研组和工区的一个工作队之间时断时续的结合，现在已发展成为全专业五个年级、三个教研组（施工、结构、建筑）和全工区工人的长期固定的结合；过去只进行一门施工课程的现场教学和一般性的生产劳动，现在已发展为施工、结构、建筑等三门课程的综合教学、技术革命、科学研究和劳动锻炼的全面结合；过去师生们帮助工人学习文化科学知识是无计划的，现在他们协助工区创办了一所建筑工人业余学校，有计划地系统地培养一批具有专科知识水平的工人。
    为了适应这种新的发展形势，在工地上建立了一套与此相适应的组织领导机构。由党员教师、学生组成的党支部，吸收工区党组织负责同志和一部分工人党员参加，全面领导师生的思想、教学、劳动、技术革命和科学研究等工作；由教师、学生代表和指定的工人、工程技术员组成“三结合”教研组，负责全面领导师生的教学工作；此外，还由工区负责同志、工人和师生代表组成“三结合”校务委员会，全面领导工人业余学校的教学工作。
    在实行了上述“三结合”的措施以后，促进了教学改革，有效地提高了教学质量。党支部发动师生和工程技术人员进行鸣放辩论，检查了过去教学中存在的少慢差费的现象，删除了教材中重复割裂、陈旧落后的部分，增加了党的建筑方针、最新的科学成就等新内容，特别是吸收了1958年以来我国工人技术革命所取得的最新成就，对于建立我国建筑施工学和工程结构学的新体系有很大帮助。他们所编的课程正在教学中进行重点试验。其中“建筑施工学”已由人民教育出版社出版。在“三结合”中同时也改革了教学方法。“三结合”教研组集体备课后，根据教材内容和各人的特长，采取教师、工人或学生单独或联合讲授的方法。例如，当学生们学到砌砖和油漆等技术操作的章节时，便由工人在现场边讲、边表演，讲完后由学生进行实地练习。一般的理论性问题由教师讲授。对于课程中既有操作技术又有理论的章节，便由工人和教师采取“二人转”式的联合讲法，如讲到电焊技术，工人讲电焊的操作方法，教师讲电焊原理；讲到工程结构，工人讲吊车的高空作业，教师讲吊车的结构和运行原理。有时也由学生讲课，如参加过预应力芯棒生产和革新的同学讲授预应力芯棒的制作工艺、结构和原理，讲得生动、具体、深刻，师生们都称赞他们是“青出于蓝，而胜于蓝”。
    今年以来，这个专业在一门课程现场教学的基础上，进一步打破课程的界限和体系，实行了几门课程的综合性现场教学，这种教学方法就是从一个建筑物的整体出发，集中各门课程中有关部分进行专题报告式的讲授。重点试验的结果证明这种综合教学方法，既减少了一半以上的学时，又使学生获得完整系统的知识，培养了学生全面地辩证地观察问题和综合解决工程技术问题的能力。使用新教材和运用新教法之后，适当地缩短了学时，提高了教学质量。学生学得多，理解得深，记得牢，用得活。
    这个专业的师生在劳动和教学中，还紧密结合工地生产的关键问题，同工人一起展开了轰轰烈烈的技术革新、技术革命运动，有力地促进了学校的科学研究和工地的生产建设。
    在“三结合”过程中，教师和学生在工地与工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，经常受到工人阶级的大公无私、忘我劳动、热爱党和忠于社会主义的高贵品质的影响和教育，普遍加强了阶级观点、劳动观点和群众观点，提高了共产主义思想觉悟。在师生们帮助下，全工区基本上扫除了文盲，工人的文化知识、科学理论、技术水平普遍提高，并在生产上收到了立竿见影的效果。（附图片）
