    Skillfully Topdressing Overwintering Crops
    The Party branch of the Shengli Production Team of the Xuejin Commune in Dangtu County, Anhui Province, mobilized the masses to summarize experiences in the management of overwintering crops, and promoted the method of rational fertilization according to local conditions, time, crop type, and seedling conditions, achieving the effect of less fertilizer and stronger wheat seedlings. The specific practices are: poor-quality bluish mud fields and red sandy fields are all fertilized with high-quality fertilizers such as ash miscellaneous fertilizer and human and animal manure; good-quality white soil fields are all fertilized with general fertilizers such as sod fertilizer and pond mud fertilizer. In the entire brigade, there are 400 mu of wheat fields that were planted later, and the seedlings in these fields are growing weakly. They universally topdressed human manure and urine within 20 days after planting, and also covered them with rotten thatch to prevent frost damage, and the seedlings quickly caught up with the first-class fields; Shengli rapeseed and Dabaimang wheat, because of their strong fertilizer absorption and great potential for increased production, were all topdressed with human and animal manure; at the same time, fertilizer was applied according to the seedlings, with strong seedlings being fertilized less and weak seedlings being fertilized more.
    The entire team adopted this "skillful fertilization" method, fully utilizing the fertilizer power, and the crops are growing vigorously, basically eliminating third-class seedlings. Dan Wei (with picture)

    给越冬作物巧施追肥
    安徽当涂县薛津公社胜利生产队党支部，在越冬作物管理工作中发动群众总结经验，推行因地、因时、因种、因苗合理施肥的办法，收到了施肥少、麦苗壮的效果。具体做法是：土质较差的青泥田和红沙田全部施用灰杂肥和人畜粪等优质肥料，土质较好的白土田全部施用了草皮肥和塘泥肥等一般肥料。全大队有四百亩麦田播种时间较晚，这些田的麦苗生长较弱，他们就在播种后二十天内普遍追了一次人粪尿，同时盖上了烂房草预防霜冻，苗子很快赶上了一类田；胜利油菜和大白芒小麦，因为吸肥力强，增产潜力大，全部追施了人畜粪肥；同时还做到了看苗施肥，壮苗少施一些，弱苗多施一些。
    全队采取了这种“巧施肥”的办法，充分发挥了肥力，作物生长旺盛，基本上消灭了三类苗。　丹　伟（附图片）
