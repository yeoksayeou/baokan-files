"In multi-ethnic socialist countries, an unbreakable alliance has been formed and consolidated among the working people of all ethnic groups. The victory of the Marxist-Leninist ethnic policy in socialist countries, the genuine equality of all nationalities, and their economic and cultural upsurge are an inspiring example for the people who are fighting against national oppression."
