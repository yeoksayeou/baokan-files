    The Sharpeville Massacre in South Africa
    —A Bloody Slaughter Concealed for Nine Months

    In early December, a book titled "The Shooting at Sharpeville" was published in England. This book uses irrefutable facts to expose a shocking act of mass slaughter of Africans by South African racists, the truth of which had been concealed for nine months.

    The Racist's Poisonous Hands

    The incident occurred on March 21st of this year in the town of Sharpeville, Transvaal, South Africa. On that day, five thousand South African natives gathered in the square near the local police station, preparing to hear the authorities' report on the issue of resident permits.

    The masses were unarmed, and the atmosphere at the scene was calm. However, the South African racists inhumanely struck a poisonous blow. According to "The Shooting at Sharpeville," "Lieutenant Pena went to the police station to work. He gathered about seventy policemen inside the iron fence of the police station. Some policemen stood on the top of armored vehicles with weapons in hand. Some policemen carried submachine guns, with the magazines full of bullets. … In about a minute, violent gunfire erupted. In an instant, the crowd panicked and fled, with those shot falling to the ground. … More than 70% of those shot were hit by bullets from behind."

    The result of this massacre was: sixty-seven people were killed on the spot, including eight women and ten children; one hundred and eighty-six people were injured, including thirty-one women and nineteen children.

    From News Blockade to Exposing the Truth

    After the bloody incident, the South African authorities blocked the news, attempting to cover up this shocking atrocity.

    However, a Johannesburg clergyman, Dr. Reeves, was present at the time of the tragedy. He took many photos of the atrocity and later exposed it to the Transvaal authorities.

    The South African Transvaal authorities, who were essentially one with the murderers, of course, would not accept Reeves' accusations. They expelled Reeves from the country on the one hand, and fabricated facts on the other, slandering the Sharpeville masses for attempting to riot, so the police opened fire in self-defense.

    However, Reverend Reeves did not remain silent. After being deported, he began writing a book to report the truth of this tragedy. This book was finally published recently. In addition to recounting what he witnessed at the time, the book also includes thirty photos taken on the spot.

    Murderous Atrocities Continue

    However, the atrocities of South African racists have not stopped because of the exposure of the Sharpeville incident.

    After the Sharpeville massacre, the Transvaal authorities asked Officer Pena, who was directly responsible for the incident, "What beneficial lessons have you learned from what happened in Sharpeville?"

    Pena replied, "We need better equipment."

    In fact, Pena's answer also represents the attitude of the South African authorities. In Pondoland, isn't the South African authority currently using troops equipped with modern weapons to massively massacre Africans?

    However, the people of South Africa have not succumbed. They are determined to use resolute struggle to break free from the humiliation of discrimination and abuse. This struggle is unfolding more and more vigorously in every corner of South Africa!

    南非夏普维尔事件
    ——一场被隐瞒了九个月的血腥屠杀
    12月上旬，在英国出版了一本名为《夏普维尔开枪事件》的书。这本书用铁一般的事实，揭露了一件真相已被隐瞒了九个月之久的、南非种族主义者大规模屠杀非洲人的骇人听闻的暴行。
    种族主义分子的毒手
    事情发生在今年3月21日，南非德兰士瓦尔的夏普维尔镇。那天，五千南非土著在当地警察局附近的广场上集合，准备听取当局关于居民通行证问题的报告。
    群众都是空手的，现场的气氛很平静。但是，南非的种族主义分子却惨无人道地下了毒手。据《夏普维尔开枪事件》一书追述：“警官佩纳中尉到警署上班，他把约七十名左右的警察集合在警署的铁丝网内，有一些警察手持武器站在装甲车车顶上。还有些警察携着手提机关枪，枪膛内装满了子弹。……在大约一分钟内，剧烈的枪声发生了，一霎那间，群众惊慌地奔逃，中枪的倒在地上。……受到枪击的人，有70％以上是枪弹从背后射入的。”
    这场屠杀的结果是：当场击毙六十七人，其中有八个是妇女、十个是小孩；击伤一百八十六人，其中有三十一个妇女、十九个小孩。
    从封锁新闻到揭露真相
    血案发生后，南非当局封锁新闻，企图把这个骇人听闻的暴行掩遮过去。
    但是，在惨剧发生的当时，有一个约翰内斯堡教士李辅斯博士在场。他把暴行经过照了很多相片，事后向德兰士瓦尔当局揭露。
    和杀人犯本为一体的南非德兰士瓦尔当局当然不会接受李辅斯的控诉。他们一方面把李辅斯驱逐出境，另一方面又捏造事实，诬蔑夏普维尔群众企图暴动，所以警察才开枪自卫。
    但是，李辅斯教士并没有沉默。他在被驱逐出境以后，就开始写书来报道这件惨案的真相。这本书终于在最近出版了。书中除了追叙了当时他目击的情况外，还附有实地拍摄的照片三十张。
    杀人暴行还在继续
    然而，南非种族主义者的暴行，并没有因为夏普维尔事件的被揭露而停止。
    在夏普维尔血案发生后，德兰士瓦尔当局曾询问对事件负直接责任的警官佩纳说：“从夏普维尔发生的事实，你得到什么有益的教训呢？”
    佩纳回答说：“我们需要更好的装备。”
    实际上，佩纳的答复也代表了南非当局的态度。在庞多兰，目前南非当局不是正在用现代化武器装备起来的军队大规模地屠杀着非洲人吗？
    但是，南非人民并没有屈服，他们决心用坚决的斗争来摆脱受歧视受虐杀的屈辱地位。这种斗争，在南非各个角落，正在越来越蓬勃地展开着！
