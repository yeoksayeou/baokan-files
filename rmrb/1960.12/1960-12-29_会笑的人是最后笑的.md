    "He Who Laughs Last, Laughs Best"
    Xie Fan
      "He who laughs last, laughs best" is a famous saying that the great Lenin said in his "Report on the Tactics of the Russian Communist Party" when talking about the issue of the electrification of all of Russia. At that time, although the Russian proletariat had achieved the great victory of the October Revolution, the industrial legacy of Tsarist Russia was very weak. In order to quickly change this backward situation and to make the Soviet state a new type of socialist industrial power, the great Lenin personally led the formulation of the grand plan for the electrification of all of Russia and issued a resounding call to the people of the whole country: "Communism is Soviet power plus electrification."
    For those bourgeois "clever talents" who only knew about the electrification of the United States, Germany, and Sweden (these three countries were the most developed countries in the capitalist world in terms of electrification at the time), facing the "small beginnings" made by the Russian proletariat in the implementation of the electrification plan, they would naturally "laugh." But would the proletariat, who wanted to overthrow the entire old world, be afraid of such ridicule? They deeply understood that the Soviet power and the incomparably superior socialist system in their own hands could guarantee that they would leave those capitalist countries with the most developed electrification far behind. The great Lenin's powerful answer to this malicious ridicule was: "He who laughs last, laughs best!"
    It has been exactly forty years since the "All-Russian Electrification Plan" was passed. Today, a strong socialist economic system has been formed in the world. In every socialist country, electrification is developing by leaps and bounds, and the economic power of socialism is constantly increasing. Taking the Soviet Union's electricity production alone, it has increased more than 580 times in the past forty years. The scale of power station construction, the length of electrified railways, and the manufacture of large generators have far surpassed all economically developed capitalist countries and have become the world's number one.
    Where are those bourgeois "clever talents" of forty years ago? Facing the large-scale construction of socialist electrification, they listened dumbfounded to the "last" laughter of the victorious proletariat, and could only turn their ridicule into wailing. Victory does not belong to them, just as the future does not belong to them.
    Of course, the proletariat, who have won the victory of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, will never be satisfied with the achievements they have already made. We will move forward at a higher speed: because our goal is not only to surpass capitalist countries, but also to move towards great communism. We will always remember the words of the great Lenin in his "Letter to the Presidium of the Eighth All-Russian Congress of Electrical Engineers": Only by developing electrification and large-scale machine industry at a high speed: "Can we carry out a smooth struggle to free mankind from the shackles of capital, so that millions of people will not be killed and maimed for the sake of British robbers and German robbers, Japanese robbers and American robbers, etc., to seize the advantage of dividing the world." Now, the east wind is blowing strongly, and the west wind is declining. The people of the world are united and struggling for world peace, national liberation, democratic freedom, and socialism. The right to laugh last belongs to the people of the whole world!

    “会笑的人是最后笑的”
    谢帆
      “会笑的人是最后笑的”这句名言，是伟大列宁在《关于俄国共产党的策略的报告》中谈到全俄电气化问题时说的。在当时说来，俄国无产阶级虽然取得了十月革命的伟大胜利，但是，沙皇俄国的工业遗产却是很薄弱的。为了迅速改变这种落后的面貌，为了使苏维埃国家成为新型的社会主义工业强国，伟大的列宁亲自领导制定了全俄电气化的宏伟计划，并且向全国人民发出了响亮的号召：“共产主义是苏维埃政权加电气化。”
    对于只知道美国、德国和瑞典的电气化（当时这三国是资本主义世界电气化最发达的国家）的那些资产阶级的“聪明才子”们，面对着俄国无产阶级在电气化计划实施时所做的“微小的开始”，自然是要“发笑”的。但是，无产阶级连整个旧世界都要推翻，还会惧怕这种嘲笑吗？他们深深地懂得，掌握在他们自己手里的苏维埃政权和无比优越的社会主义制度，能够有保证地使他们把那些电气化最发达的资本主义国家远远地抛在后面。伟大列宁对于这种恶意嘲笑的有力回答，就是：“会笑的人是最后笑的！”
    距离“全俄电气化计划”的通过，已经整整四十年了。在今天，世界上已经形成了强大的社会主义经济体系，在每一个社会主义国家里，电气化都在飞跃地发展，社会主义的经济威力都在不断地增涨。仅仅以苏联的电力产量来看，四十年来就增加了五百八十倍以上，电站建设的规模和电气化铁路的长度以及大型发电机的制造，已经远远超过一切经济发达的资本主义国家，跃居世界第一位。
    四十年前的那些资产阶级的“聪明才子”们，哪里去了呢？他们面对着大规模的社会主义电气化的建设，目瞪口呆地听着胜利的无产阶级的“最后”的笑声，自己却只能变嘲笑为哀鸣了。胜利并不属于他们，正如未来不属于他们一样。
    当然，取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设胜利的无产阶级，决不会满足已有的成就，我们将采取更高的速度前进：因为我们的目标不仅是超过资本主义国家，而且是走向伟大的共产主义。我们将永远记住伟大列宁《给全俄电气技师第八次代表大会主席团的信》中所说的话：只有高速度地发展电气化和大机器工业：“才能进行顺利的斗争，使人类摆脱资本的桎梏，使千百万人不要为了英国强盗和德国强盗，日本强盗和美国强盗等等夺取瓜分世界的优势而遭到杀戮和残害。”现在，东风劲吹，西风日衰，全世界人民都在为世界和平、民族解放、民主自由和社会主义而团结斗争，最后笑的权利，属于全世界人民！
