Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 21st: Staff member Savelyeva of the Soviet Sternberg Astronomical Institute discovered a new "nova" in the constellation Scutum that has not been seen by any observatory in the world, according to TASS.

This "nova" was discovered using spectroscopic methods. It is the second "nova" discovered this year. The first "nova" was discovered this spring and was visible to the naked eye.

According to astronomical materials, a "nova" is a star whose brightness can suddenly increase many times in a short period of one or two days. Its brightness then begins to diminish, gradually returning to its original brightness after a few weeks or months. The scientific community believes that the sudden increase in the brightness of a "nova" is the result of its own explosion. During the explosion, the volume of its outer layer expands to the point where it can even accommodate the orbit of Jupiter.

Kukarkin, Vice Chairman of the Astronomical Committee of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said that the appearance or "explosion" of a "nova" is extremely brief, and each such event has great scientific significance.

    苏联科学家发现新的“新星”
    新华社22日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科21日讯：苏联什捷恩别格天文学研究所工作人员萨维利耶娃发现了世界上任何一个天文台都未曾看到过的一颗新的“新星”。
    这颗“新星”是用光谱方法在盾牌星座中发现的。它是今年发现的第二颗“新星”。第一颗“新星”是今年春天发现的，它用肉眼都可以看得见。 
    据天文学材料，“新星”是一种亮度可以在一、两天的短暂时间里突然增加许多倍的恒星。它的亮度在这以后又开始减弱，几星期或几个月之后渐渐回到原亮度。科学界认为，“新星”亮度突增是它本身爆发的结果。爆发时它的外层体积扩大到甚至可以把木星轨道都容纳进去。
    苏联科学院天文学委员会副主席库卡尔金说，“新星”的出现或“爆发”是极短暂的，每一次这样的事件都有巨大的科学意义。
