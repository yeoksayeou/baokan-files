Guangdong Refines Management of Overwintering Crops; Fujian Continues to Expand Winter Planting Area

    This newspaper reports from Guangzhou on the 14th: Guangdong's autumn production work, centered on autumn harvest and winter planting, has achieved great victories under the in-depth implementation of policies and the strengthening of specific leadership by party organizations at all levels. At present, the late-season double-crop rice harvest has concluded throughout the province, and the harvest of autumn sweet potatoes, peanuts, cassava, and other crops is also entering its final stage. In addition to arranging appropriate labor to continue re-harvesting, re-threshing, and storing grain, all regions have fully shifted to a winter production campaign centered on expanding and managing winter crops effectively.
    This year, under the call to vigorously develop grain production, Guangdong has fully utilized its superior conditions of three crops a year, greatly expanding planting and reclaiming wasteland. By the beginning of this month, the province had planted over 20 million mu of winter sweet potatoes, wheat, potatoes, and beans, significantly more than the same period last year. Currently, all regions are managing overwintering crops in the fields with the same vigor as they manage rice paddies. The overwintering crops are generally growing luxuriantly.
    Before the start of the autumn harvest and winter planting, people's communes and production brigades throughout the province adjusted the "three guarantees" targets for the late rice crop and implemented "three guarantees" targets for winter planting, improving the system of fixed quotas and work point calculation, which greatly mobilized the masses' enthusiasm for production. As a result, the autumn harvest and winter planting began with high work efficiency, high quality, high speed, exceeding planned areas, exceeding guaranteed yields, and exceeding total output. After implementing measures such as group operation, individual responsibility, and work point calculation, Wan'ning County doubled its harvesting efficiency. After repeatedly publicizing the provincial party committee's seven winter planting policies, the Shaoguan Special Zone had exceeded its original winter grain crop plan by the end of November.
    During this autumn harvest and winter planting, the mass movement of workers from all sectors of the province to support agriculture reached an unprecedented scale. After the start of the autumn harvest and winter planting, government cadres, factory and mine workers, urban residents, and local troops formed a large army to support the autumn harvest and winter planting, going to the front lines to assist people's communes in rushing the harvest and planting, creating a vast momentum of "workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants all working on grain production."

    This newspaper reports: Fujian Province's concentration of superior forces to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, and the further implementation of various policies of the People's Communes, has brought about an excellent situation in winter planting production. According to statistics reported by various regions on December 6th, the various winter crops planted throughout the province account for more than two-thirds of the original plan. Among them, Longhai, Changtai, Wuping, Jianning, Jianyang, Minqing, Sanming, Zhangzhou, Qingning, Liancheng, and other counties and cities have completed or exceeded the planting plan for grain crops, and several other counties are close to completion. At present, areas that have not completed the winter planting task are rushing to plant, and areas that have completed the winter planting task are continuing to expand planting. A production upsurge to exceed guaranteed yields and seize bumper harvests is flourishing.
    In this year's winter planting production, while strengthening political leadership, party committees at all levels have further promoted the style of leading production according to local conditions, handing over the power of production to the masses, and allowing commune members to be masters of their own affairs, so that the winter planting plan is more realistic and technical measures are adapted to local conditions. The "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" is scientifically applied, and winter planting production is based on an active, reliable, and solid foundation. Because various regions consult with the masses and implement planting according to local conditions, many areas have utilized previously idle winter fields that did not have winter planting, expanded the area of winter planting, and expanded the variety of winter crops. In the province's winter planting area, in addition to most of the area being planted with wheat and overwintering sweet potatoes and other food crops, a large number of vegetables, rapeseed, broad beans, potatoes, winter tobacco, milk vetch, safflower grass and other oil crops, miscellaneous grains, green manure and cash crops have also been planted, laying the material foundation for better arrangements for the people's lives and production this winter and next spring.
    At present, various regions are continuing to concentrate their efforts, seize the final opportunity to continue rushing to plant, and strive to complete and over fulfill the winter planting tasks without violating the agricultural season. At the same time, in accordance with the spirit of "plant it and manage it, manage it to the end," great efforts are being made in field management work such as ensuring full seedling emergence, strengthening seedlings, accumulating fertilizer, topdressing fertilizer, cultivating and weeding, rational irrigation, preventing cold, and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests.

    广东精细管理越冬作物  福建继续扩大冬种面积
    本报广州14日电　广东以秋收冬种为中心的秋季生产工作，在各级党组织深入贯彻执行政策，加强具体领导下，已取得巨大胜利。目前，全省双季晚稻收获工作已经结束，秋番薯、花生、木薯等作物的收获工作也已进入扫尾阶段，各地除安排适当劳力继续进行复收复打、粮食入仓等工作外，已全力转入以扩种和管好冬种作物为中心的冬季生产运动。
    今年广东各地在大办粮食的号召下，充分利用一年三熟的优越条件，大搞扩种和开荒，到本月初，全省已种下冬番薯、小麦、马铃薯和豆类等作物二千多万亩，比去年同期扩大了很多。目前，全省各地正以精管水稻的劲头，进行越冬作物的田间管理。现在，各地的过冬作物普遍生长茂盛。
    秋收冬种开始前，全省各人民公社和生产大队就调整晚造“三包”指标，落实冬种“三包”指标，健全定额责任制和评工计分制度等，极大地调动了群众的生产积极性。因此，秋收冬种一开始，各地就出现了高工效、高质量、高速度，超面积、超包产、超总产的局面。万宁县在实行了小组操作、责任到人、评工计分等措施后，收割效率提高一倍。韶关专区经过反复宣传省委关于冬种七项政策后，到11月底全区已超额完成了原定今年冬种粮食作物计划。
    在这次秋收冬种中，全省各行各业职工支援农业的群众运动达到了前所未有的规模。秋收冬种开始后，机关干部、厂矿职工、城镇居民和当地驻军就纷纷组成支援秋收冬种大军，开赴秋收冬种前线，协助各人民公社进行抢收抢种，形成了“工农兵学商一齐来办粮”的浩大声势。
    本报讯　福建省集中优势兵力大办农业、大办粮食，和进一步贯彻人民公社的各项政策，带来了冬种生产的一派大好形势。据各地12月6日汇报统计，全省已种的各种冬种作物占原订计划的三分之二以上，其中龙海、长泰、武平、建宁、建阳、闽清、三明、漳州、清宁、连城等县、市已经完成或超额完成粮食作物的种植计划，还有若干县已经接近完成。目前，没有完成冬种任务的地区正在全力抢种，已经完成冬种任务的地区又在继续扩种。一个超包产、夺丰收的生产热潮正在蓬勃发展。
    在今年冬种生产中，各级党委在加强政治领导的同时，进一步发扬了因地制宜领导生产的作风，把生产大权交给群众，由社员当家作主，使得冬种计划订得更加切合实际，技术措施因地制宜，科学的运用农业“八字宪法”，把冬种生产建立在积极可靠、扎扎实实的基础上。由于各地和群众商量办事，实行因地种植，许多地区利用了过去没有冬种的冬闲田，扩大了冬种面积，也扩大了冬种作物的品种。在全省冬种面积中，除了大部分种植大小麦和越冬番薯等粮食作物外，还种植了大量的蔬菜、油菜、蚕豌豆、马铃薯、冬烟、紫云英、红花草等油料、杂粮、绿肥和经济作物，为今冬明春更好地安排好群众生活、生产，准备了物质基础。
    目前，各地正在继续集中力量，抓紧最后时机继续抢种，力争不违农时地完成和超额完成冬种任务。同时，根据“一种就管，一管到底”的精神，大抓全苗、壮苗、积肥、追肥、中耕除草、合理灌溉、防寒、防治病虫害等田间管理工作。
