    Xinhua News Agency, Sydney: Approximately 68,000 transport workers in New South Wales, Australia, held a 24-hour strike on November 29th. On this day, all government-controlled trains, trams, and buses were brought to a standstill. This is the largest strike of its kind in Australian history. At the same time, government transport workers in South Australia also held a five-hour strike in support of the New South Wales workers’ strike.
    The large-scale strike by transport workers in New South Wales was held after their demand for a weekly increase of two pounds in enterprise allowance was rejected. The strikers gave the government a seven-day deadline, after which they will reconvene to discuss further action.

    澳大利亚六万多运输工人举行大罢工
    新南威尔士政府控制的车辆交通全部停顿
    据新华社讯　悉尼消息：澳大利亚新南威尔士州约六万八千名运输工人在11月29日举行了二十四小时罢工。这一天，由政府控制的火车、电车和公共汽车全部陷于停顿。这是澳大利亚历史上最大的一次这种性质的罢工。同时，南澳大利亚州的政府运输工人也举行了五小时罢工，支持新南威尔士工人的罢工。
    新南威尔士州运输工人的大罢工是在工人们提出的每周增加两镑企业津贴的要求被拒绝以后举行的。罢工者给予政府为时七天的限期，到那时他们将再行集会商议采取进一步的行动。
