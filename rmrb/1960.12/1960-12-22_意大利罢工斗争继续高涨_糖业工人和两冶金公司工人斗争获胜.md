    Italian Strike Struggle Continues to Rise
    Sugar Industry Workers and Two Metallurgical Company Workers Win Struggles
    The strike struggle in Italy continues to rise.
    Italian journalists nationwide began a two-day strike on the 16th, demanding increased wages and revisions to labor contracts.
    Due to this strike, newspapers and magazines could not be published nationwide in Italy on the 17th and 18th. Staff of the Italian "ANSA News Agency" and radio stations also participated in this strike.
    Workers of private oil companies already held a two-day nationwide strike from the 15th. More than 35,000 railway workers held a major strike at midnight on the 11th, demanding increased wages and reduced working hours. As a result, railway transportation throughout Italy was almost completely paralyzed.
    Professors and teachers in public schools will also strike for two days before Christmas.
    The strike by Milan electrical industry workers forced the factory to agree to hold negotiations with the workers on the 9th.
    The nationwide struggle of 50,000 confectionery industry workers in Italy, which began in the latter half of last month, has achieved complete victory. Employers have agreed to conclude a nationwide collective contract, which stipulates a general wage increase of 16% and increases workers' annual leave.
    Workers of Italy's two largest metallurgical companies—Ilva Steel Company and Cornigliano Company—have achieved victory. Company authorities have agreed to increase wages by 4.5%, and weekly working hours have also been somewhat reduced.
