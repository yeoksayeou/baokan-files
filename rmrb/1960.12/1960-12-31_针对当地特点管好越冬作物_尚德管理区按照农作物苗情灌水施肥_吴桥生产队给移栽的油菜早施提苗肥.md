    The Shangde Management Area Irrigates and Fertilizes According to Crop Seedling Conditions
    The Wuqiao Production Team Applies Early Seedling Fertilizer to Transplanted Rapeseed

    This newspaper reports that the Shangde Management Area of ​​Sayingpan Commune in Luquan County, Yunnan Province, seriously analyzed and studied the characteristics of mountain production, used successful experience, and adapted measures to manage winter crops according to local conditions, time, and variety.

    The Shangde Management Area is a mountainous area with an altitude of more than 2,300 meters. The growing period of winter crops is generally about 160 days. This year, the drought is severe, and the water storage capacity of small-scale water conservancy projects has decreased compared with previous years. According to several years of practical experience, the primary key to ensuring a bumper harvest of winter crops in mountainous areas is water. Generally, wheat fields that can be irrigated two to three times can yield about 300 catties per mu, those that can only be irrigated once yield about 200 catties per mu, and those that lack irrigation yield only about 100 catties or dozens of catties per mu.

    How to use existing successful experiences to guide the current winter crop production according to the characteristics of the local area? The management area party branch, based on the field seedling investigation and ranking results of each production team, adopted three types of processing measures for three different situations in the entire management area: The first category is mostly basic farmland with good water conservancy conditions, which can guarantee more than three irrigations. According to the results of the seedling investigation and research by veteran farmers and cadres, the current main task for this type of seedlings is to grasp appropriate control. For wheat, the soil should be rammed and compacted to control seedling growth and promote early rooting and tillering; rapeseed should also be tipped once to promote more branching and pod formation; later, water and fertilizer should be applied separately during the jointing, flowering, and grain-filling stages; at the same time, natural disasters such as diseases and insect pests should be prevented as early as possible. The second category of fields is mostly located in high-altitude cold mountainous areas above 2,500 meters, and a small part is distributed in the shady mountainous areas of each team. As long as processing and management are well done, this type of land can also obtain increased production. The important issue is to apply topdressing fertilizer to promote seedling growth, and more quick-acting fertilizers such as fertilizer field nitrate and human manure should be applied; at the same time, according to the characteristics of many sheep in the local mountainous area, sheep flocks can be used to trample the ground once or twice when the crops are very small to increase soil temperature and promote seedling growth. The third category of fields is mostly newly expanded distant fields and remote lands this year, with the worst water irrigation conditions, and the soil is mostly clay soil that is prone to hardening. This type of field is a weak link in mountain production. According to the opinions of the masses, a combination of water and fertilizer is used to manage this type of land. It was decided to use the characteristics of the small and scattered water sources in the mountainous area to newly dig and renovate 360 field manure ponds, and use as much of the available water sources as possible.

    At present, the wheat in more than 1,600 mu of basic farmland in the entire management area has been compacted once, and the rapeseed has been tipped once. More than 370 mu of the more than 800 mu of mountainous land far from the village has been watered with liquid manure.

    This newspaper reports that the Wuqiao Production Team of Xinchang Commune in Nanhui County, Shanghai City, recently adopted the measure of applying early seedling fertilizer based on the characteristics of the large area, long time, and uneven growth of rapeseed transplants, so as to promote the upgrading of three types of seedlings.

    The planned planting area of ​​rapeseed in Wuqiao Production Team this year is 511 mu, an increase of more than 78% over last year. After the end of the transplant, a comprehensive inspection revealed that the green seedlings were not growing evenly in size. The main reason is that the transplanting time is different, and the size of the seedlings is different. In particular, more than 80% of the worst three types of seedlings are planted in fields with thin soil, hard soil, and previous crops of red radishes, double-cropping rice, and late-growing cotton.

    Based on the above situation, everyone believes that in order to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest of rapeseed next year, we must first find ways to make these three types of small seedlings grow quickly and catch up with the second type of seedlings or even the first type of seedlings. What should we do? The production team convened a forum of small team cadres and veteran farmers to study this issue specifically. During the discussion, it was unanimously agreed that in order to promote the early growth of the late-planted three types of small seedlings, the primary condition is to apply early seedling fertilizer. In addition to applying early seedling fertilizer, sufficient wax fertilizer should also be applied to consolidate winter growth and strive for spring growth. According to everyone's opinions, the production team decided to apply mud slurry to the fields of the first and second types of seedlings, and first pour manure and then apply mud slurry to the fields of the third type of seedlings. As for how much to use, it depends on the specific conditions of the field's strength, the amount of base fertilizer, and the growth of the green seedlings.

    After the measures were determined, each small team adopted a separate line of operations to implement them. The entire production team has 160 people specializing in mid-cultivation and soil loosening, 33 agricultural boats and 66 laborers are responsible for accumulating fertilizer, and 30% of the labor force is responsible for topdressing. As of the 21st, the team has cultivated and loosened soil on 267 mu of fields, and applied the first fertilizer to 498 mu of fields, and applied the second fertilizer to 32 mu of fields.

### 针对当地特点管好越冬作物  尚德管理区按照农作物苗情灌水施肥  吴桥生产队给移栽的油菜早施提苗肥

    针对当地特点管好越冬作物
    尚德管理区按照农作物苗情灌水施肥
    吴桥生产队给移栽的油菜早施提苗肥
    本报讯　云南禄劝县撒营盘公社尚德管理区，认真分析研究山区生产的特点，运用成功经验，因地、因时因品种制宜加工管理小春。
    尚德管理区是一个拔海二千三百多米的山区。小春的成长期一般都在一百六十天左右。今年干旱严重，小型水利蓄水量比往年减少。根据几年来的实践经验，保证山区小春丰收的首要关键是水。一般能润水二至三次的麦田，亩产量可达三百斤左右，只能润一次水的亩产二百斤上下，缺水浇润的亩产量就只有百把斤或几十斤。
    如何根据本地的特点，运用既有的成功经验，指导好当前的小春生产呢？管理区党支部根据各生产队田间查苗排队结果，在全管理区就三种不同情况采取了三类加工措施：第一类绝大部分都是水利条件好的基本农田，可以保证润水三次以上。根据老农和干部查苗研究结果，这类苗棵当前主要是抓适当的控制，小麦要捶土镇压，控制苗棵徒长，促使其早盘根多分蘖；油菜也要打一次尖，促使其多分枝多结荚；以后分别在拔节、扬花、灌浆时润水追肥；同时要及早防治病虫等自然灾害。第二类田地大部分座落在拔海二千五百米以上的高寒山区，少部分是分布在各队的背阴山地。这类土地只要抓好加工管理，也可以获得增产。重要的问题是施追肥催苗，而且应多施肥田硝、人粪尿等速效肥；同时根据当地山区羊多的特点，在作物很小时可以搞一至二次羊群踩地，提高地温，催苗成长。第三类田地大部分都是今年新扩种的远田远地，水利灌溉条件最差，而土质又多数是容易板结的胶泥土。这类田地是山区生产中的一个薄弱环节。根据群众的意见，对这类地采取水和肥双管齐下的办法进行管理。决定利用山区小股水源分散的特点，新挖和整修了三百六十个田间粪塘，把可以利用的水源都尽量利用起来。
    目前，全管理区一千六百多亩基本农田的小麦已经镇压过一次，油菜已经打了一次尖。离村较远的八百多亩山地，已经用清粪水浇了三百七十多亩。
    本报讯　上海市南汇县新场公社吴桥生产队最近根据油菜移栽面积大、时间长、生长不平衡的特点，采取早施提苗肥的措施，促使油菜三类苗升级。
    吴桥生产队今年油菜计划种植面积为五百十一亩，比去年扩大了78％以上。在结束移栽之后，通过全面检查，发现青苗长得大小不匀。主要原因在于移栽时间不一，秧苗大小不一。特别是最差的三类苗中，有80％以上都是种在田脚瘦、泥土硬、前茬是红萝卜、双季稻和迟发的棉花田里的。
    根据上述情况，大家认为要争取明年油菜全面丰收，首先必须想办法使眼前这些三类苗赶快发棵，赶上二类苗甚至一类苗。怎么办呢？生产队召开了小队干部和老农座谈会，专门研究这个问题。在讨论中，一致认为要促使晚种的三类小苗早发棵，首要条件是早施提苗肥。除了早施提苗肥以外，还要施足腊肥，以巩固冬发，力争春发。根据大家的意见，生产队决定在一类苗和二类苗田里施泥浆，三类苗田里先浇大粪，后施泥浆。至于用量多少，看田脚壮瘦、基肥多少和青苗长势等具体情况而定。
    措施确定以后，各小队都采取了分线作战的办法加以贯彻。全生产队有一百六十人专门负责中耕松土，三十三只农船、六十六个劳力负责积肥，有30％的劳动力负责追肥，到21日止，全队已有二百六十七亩田经过中耕、松土，已有四百九十八亩田施了第一次肥，三十二亩田施了第二次肥。（附图片）
