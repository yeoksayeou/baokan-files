    In Shenyang, Wang Fengen, a famous innovation expert and engineer from the Shenyang Transformer Factory, said: This statement connects the hearts of people all over the world and points out the goals of our struggle towards victory. He said that with the unity of the international proletariat and the unity of the people of the world, coupled with the correct path of struggle, no force can stop us from advancing. Yang Yuhuan, the captain of the Shangchang Production Team of the Beiling People's Commune in Shenyang, said: It is encouraging to see the tremendous changes that have taken place in the world situation and the international communist movement in the past three years, as pointed out in the statement. The changes in the past three years have proved how wise and correct Chairman Mao's thesis that "the enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day" is. Ning Wu, Che Xiangchen, Gong Tianmin, Chen Enfeng, Shen Hongtao, and Han Pengtai, heads of local organizations of various democratic parties in Liaoning Province and Shenyang City, and non-party personages, pointed out that the statement of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' parties of all countries is a guide to action for progressive mankind and all peace-loving people in the world. It not only brings great encouragement to the people of socialist countries, but also brings the power of struggle to all oppressed people in the world.
    Li Fengen, a famous labor model in Wuhan, and Zhu Zaodi, a "red banner bearer" of the First Cotton Mill, said at the symposium that this statement expressed the common aspirations of the international proletariat and the people of the world. Heads of people's organizations and local organizations of various democratic parties in Wuhan, as well as members of urban communes, also expressed their warm support after reading the statement.
    At the symposiums held separately by the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and the Wuhan Municipal Committee, Tao Shuzeng, Acting Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), Tang Zhe, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, Dong Yanliang, Deputy Director of the Hubei Provincial Women's Federation, and Chen Jingshu, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, said in their speeches that they should study and publicize this statement well, closely unite around the Chinese Communist Party, and resolutely strive to achieve the struggle goals stipulated in the statement.
    More than 50 advanced producers from various systems in Guangzhou held a symposium on the afternoon of the 8th. Wu Lingjian, a worker at the Guangzhou Paper Mill, said: The statement shows the further unity of the international working class. We warmly respond to the call of the statement, strengthen the struggle against imperialism, and completely smash the war conspiracy of imperialism. Su Tusheng, a worker at the Guangdong Tractor Factory, said that this statement will further encourage the confidence of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in winning the victory of the national democratic revolution. Chen Nengxing, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, Zhou Wanru, Director of the Guangdong Provincial Women's Federation, and Huang Dafang, Acting Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, said that the successful conclusion of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' parties of all countries is a great victory for the international proletariat and the people of the world.
    In Chongqing, Zhou Zhida, Deputy Director of the Agricultural Science Research Institute of the China-Soviet Friendship People's Commune in Jiangbei District, said excitedly after reading the statement that the great achievements of this meeting will further strengthen the unity of the socialist camp and the unity of Communist and Workers' parties of all countries in the world. Li Shaoyan, head of the Chongqing Acrobatic Troupe, who had just returned from visits to socialist countries such as the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and the German Democratic Republic, said that we personally witnessed the moving scene of the prosperous development of socialist and communist construction in various brotherly countries during our visit, and saw the warm friendship that the people of these countries showed to us, which made us deeply feel the unparalleled strength and invincibility of the socialist camp. Employees of many factories and mining enterprises such as Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, Yutianpu Coal Mine, Chongqing Automobile Transportation Company, and 610 Textile Dyeing Factory also held symposiums. Xia Zhongshi, Xiao Huaqing, Wang Wenbin, Fu Jun, Liu Xilin, Shui Xiheng and other heads of local organizations of various democratic parties in Chongqing also unanimously expressed their support for this statement during the symposium.
    In Xi'an, on the 7th alone, more than 40 units of provincial-level agencies held symposiums separately. Many factories, schools, and urban communes also held symposiums. At the symposium held by workers of the Xi'an Bayi Iron and Steel Plant, Zhang Fugui, the head of the No. 2 furnace of the plant, said: "The practical action of us steel workers to support this statement is to produce more iron and good iron. Strengthen the strength of the socialist camp and smash the aggressive policies and war policies of US imperialism." At the symposium held in the Beilin Urban People's Commune in Yanta District, Gao Yunxia, director of the residents' committee, said excitedly that reading the statement added strength to people. If the proletariat and all progressive people of the world further unite and strengthen the struggle, the days of imperialism are numbered.
