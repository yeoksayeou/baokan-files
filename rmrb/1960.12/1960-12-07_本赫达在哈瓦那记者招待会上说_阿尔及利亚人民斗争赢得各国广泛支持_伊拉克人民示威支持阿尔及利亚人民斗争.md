Xinhua News Agency, Havana, December 3rd: Ben Bella, head of the Algerian delegation, said at a press conference in Havana today, "The war in Algeria is shattering the myth of the invincibility of imperialism and proves that a people, though small, united and determined to fight, can resist and win."

	Ben Bella said, "The Algerian people first took all legal and peaceful means to restore her independence, but in the end she had to take up arms on November 1, 1954, because there was no other way." He condemned the crimes of the French colonialists in Algeria and rejected De Gaulle's new conspiracy to create a so-called "Republic of Algeria." He emphasized that "France is not alone in this war; it receives large-scale support from the major powers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, especially the United States, specifically in the form of military and economic aid."

	Ben Bella said that the struggle of the Algerian people "has won the sympathy and support of the people of all countries in the world. International support is growing day by day." He said that all Cubans breathe the same air as the Algerian people and are enthusiastically watching the developments in Algeria's struggle. Although the Cuban government and people have not yet recognized Algeria, they unreservedly support Algeria's struggle.

	Ben Bella pointed out that the great People's Republic of China stands with the Algerian people. The Soviet government, which has consistently condemned the colonial war in Algeria, has also recently de facto recognized the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria. The aid given to Algeria by the socialist camp in all aspects will continue to grow. He said, "The people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, as well as democrats all over the world, unreservedly support the Algerian people's struggle for independence."

	Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, December 6th: Thousands of students and people from all walks of life in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, held a large-scale demonstration yesterday in support of the just struggle of the Algerian people.

	Demonstrators chanted slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism—the main ally of French colonialism in Algeria" and "Down with the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization."

	Students and other demonstrators held up banners demanding that people support Algeria's just cause and condemning the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for supporting French imperialists against Algerian fighters.

	The demonstrators later held a meeting and passed several resolutions. The resolutions stated, "We declare that we condemn the imperialist aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance, led by the United States, and its member states for supporting and participating in the imperialist dirty war against the Algerian people who are fighting for freedom and independence, and for continuing it." The resolution called on the governments of all Arab countries to support the heroic Algerian people's struggle against imperialism and to boycott France economically.

	The resolution called for the release of Algerian patriots Ahmed Ben Cherif and student Abdul Wahab Muhammad and all other Algerian patriots imprisoned by the tyrannical French imperialism.

	These resolutions have been telegraphed to the United Nations Organization, which is currently discussing the Algerian issue.

    阿尔及利亚人民斗争赢得各国广泛支持
    伊拉克人民示威支持阿尔及利亚人民斗争
    新华社哈瓦那3日电　阿尔及利亚代表团团长本赫达今天在哈瓦那举行的记者招待会上说，“阿尔及利亚的战争正在粉碎帝国主义不可战胜的神话，并且证明，虽然小但是却团结一致和坚决斗争的人民能够抵抗并取得胜利。”
    本赫达说，“阿尔及利亚人民首先采取了一切合法的与和平的手段来恢复她的独立，可是最后她不得不在1954年11月1日拿起武器，因为没有其他办法了。”他谴责了法国殖民主义者在阿尔及利亚的罪行，并且拒绝了戴高乐制造所谓“阿尔及利亚共和国”的新阴谋。他强调指出，“法国在这场战争中并不是单独一个，它得到北大西洋公约组织的大国，特别是美国的大规模支持，具体地说就是军事和经济援助。”
    本赫达说，阿尔及利亚人民的斗争“赢得了世界各国人民的同情和支援。国际上的支援正在与日俱增。”他说，所有的古巴人都和阿尔及利亚人民同呼吸，并且热情地注视着阿尔及利亚的斗争中的事态。古巴政府和人民虽然还没有承认阿尔及利亚，但是他们无保留地支持阿尔及利亚的斗争。
    本赫达指出，伟大的中华人民共和国同阿尔及利亚人民站在一起。一贯谴责阿尔及利亚殖民战争的苏联政府最近也在事实上承认了阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府。社会主义阵营在各方面给予阿尔及利亚的援助将日益增长。他说，“亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的人民以及全世界的民主人士都无保留地支持阿尔及利亚人民争取独立的斗争。”
    新华社巴格达6日电　伊拉克首都巴格达数以千计的学生和其他各阶层人民昨天举行大规模示威，支持阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争。
    示威者高呼“打倒美帝国主义——法国殖民主义在阿尔及利亚的主要同盟者”和“打倒侵略性的北大西洋公约组织集团”等口号。
    学生和其他的示威者高举标语，要求人们支持阿尔及利亚的正义事业，谴责北大西洋公约组织支持法帝国主义者对付阿尔及利亚的战士。
    示威者后来举行集会，并通过几项决议。决议说，“我们宣布，我们谴责以美国为首的、帝国主义侵略性的北大西洋公约组织同盟及其成员国支持和参加反对正在为自由和独立而战斗的阿尔及利亚人民的帝国主义肮脏战争，并使它继续进行。”决议要求各阿拉伯国家政府支持英勇的阿尔及利亚人民反对帝国主义的斗争，在经济上抵制法国。
    决议要求释放被暴虐的法帝国主义监禁的阿尔及利亚爱国者艾哈迈德·本·谢里夫和学生阿卜杜勒·瓦哈卜·穆罕默德和所有其他阿尔及利亚爱国者。
    这些决议都已用电报拍给目前正在讨论阿尔及利亚问题的联合国组织。
