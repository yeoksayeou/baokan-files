    China-Soviet Friendship Endures Forever
    —A Record of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation's Visit to Various Parts of the Soviet Union
    Our correspondents Li Nan and Cui Yongchang

    On the morning of December 3rd, before dawn had broken over Leningrad, the northern city, a joyous crowd had already gathered along the several-kilometer-long Nevsky Prospekt. Row upon row of young men and women held Chinese national flags and large banners made of red cloth, waiting to welcome the distinguished Chinese guests.

    Nevsky Prospekt, this famous street, appeared exceptionally simple and beautiful in the pre-dawn hours. Along both sides of the street, the national flags of China and the Soviet Union fluttered in the gentle breeze, and the large banners held by the people, “Welcome, dear Comrade Liu Shaoqi,” “Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship,” added to the festive atmosphere of the street.

    Leningrad, the city of the revolution's cradle, is very dear to the hearts of the Chinese people. Over the eleven years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, this city has established close friendly ties with our country. Many people from here have visited China and witnessed firsthand the great achievements and moving deeds of the Chinese people in building socialism under the leadership of the Party. Many factories in Leningrad have provided machinery and equipment to China, and many experts have come to many important construction sites in our country, providing us with all kinds of assistance. Many universities in Leningrad also have Chinese students. Therefore, when the Chinese Party and Government Delegation arrived in Leningrad, the people of this heroic city welcomed the distinguished Chinese guests with particularly warm feelings.

    The "Moscow" station in Leningrad was filled with a festive atmosphere. Large portraits of Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Khrushchev, and Brezhnev were hung high in the hall, as well as large banners written in both Chinese and Russian: "Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the two great peoples of the Soviet Union and China!"

    At 9:07 in the morning, when the special train pulled into the platform and Chairman Liu Shaoqi stepped out of the carriage accompanied by Chairman Brezhnev and Comrade F.R. Kozlov, a burst of cheers erupted around them, and the vast square in front of the station was packed with people. As Chairman Liu Shaoqi waved to the welcoming crowd, the people of Leningrad could not help but wave the five-star red flags in their hands and shout, "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!" The majestic "Hurrah" sounded like huge waves, rolling along the streets of Leningrad with the vehicle carrying Chairman Liu, and many people also approached the delegation's car, warmly greeting in somewhat fluent Chinese: "Comrade, hello!"

    The meeting between the Chinese Party and Government Delegation and the workers of the Kirov Factory on this day left an unforgettable impression on people, once again demonstrating the great friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China. The Kirov Factory is a factory with a long and outstanding revolutionary history. The great Lenin delivered many famous speeches here, and from the factory's central ground, Lenin's majestic voice was transmitted to the world. Now, in the place where Lenin delivered his speeches, a huge statue of Lenin has been erected.

    More than two hours before Chairman Liu arrived at the factory, the news of the Chinese guests' impending arrival had spread widely among the workers. Many workers who had finished their night shifts rushed back to participate in the meeting with the Chinese Party and Government Delegation. Many retired old workers also rushed to the factory. Old Bolshevik Nikiforov, who had participated in three revolutions, was particularly excited. He told reporters, "It is a major event for our factory that Comrade Liu Shaoqi can spare the time to visit our factory." He also asked reporters about Comrade Mao Zedong's health. Standing next to him, an old communist party member with over forty years of party membership, Kiyakova, also said, "We older generation people know the difficulties before the revolution and in the early days after the revolution. Therefore, every achievement of the Chinese people in construction makes us feel happy and proud."

    After Chairman Liu arrived at the factory, he visited two mechanical equipment workshops accompanied by Brezhnev, F.R. Kozlov, and factory director Isayev. Wherever the delegation went, there were cheers and applause. In the turbine workshop, when Chairman Liu walked up to advanced worker Kozlov, he had a cordial conversation with him. Kozlov told Chairman Liu about his work situation and said, "We are very happy that you have come to our factory. We admire the achievements of the Chinese people in implementing national industrialization." In the factory, Chairman Liu also talked with advanced producer Karasev and old Bolshevik Telyakova, who participated in the civil war.

    At twelve o'clock, a mass rally of all the factory workers was held in the factory. Old worker Miroshnikov, who participated in the October Revolution, said enthusiastically at the meeting that the workers deeply believed when attacking the Winter Palace that the banner raised by the great Lenin would flutter all over the world. And now that time has come. When Chairman Liu Shaoqi spoke, the meeting hall resounded with prolonged and enthusiastic applause. The workers shouted, "Salute to the great and hardworking Chinese people!" "Long live the glorious Chinese Communist Party!" At the end of the meeting, the participants sang the Internationale in unison.

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi and other Chinese guests' visit to the cruiser "Aurora" was also very moving. Even before the guests arrived, the sailors on the ship had lined up in the biting cold wind to wait. Chairman Liu Shaoqi listened carefully to the captain's account of the warship's heroic history. The sailors uncovered the cannon facing the Winter Palace and introduced to Chairman Liu that it was this cannon that fired the signal to attack the Winter Palace, announcing the beginning of a new era. The captain introduced Chairman Liu Shaoqi to an old man with white hair, who was the first political commissar of the cruiser "Aurora." Chairman Liu Shaoqi shook hands with him cordially and said, "The sound of the 'Aurora' awakened the Chinese people and also awakened the working people of the world. Before the sound of the 'Aurora' cannon, we Chinese people did not know Marx, and we did not know Lenin. After the 'Aurora' cannon, the Chinese people knew Lenin and the Bolsheviks." At this time, F.R. Kozlov, who was standing next to him, said, "Comrade Belyshev directly ordered the firing of the cannon that year." Chairman Liu Shaoqi said to Belyshev, "Thank you." The old man Belyshev was very moved. Chairman Liu Shaoqi specially took a photo with him.

    In Leningrad, Chairman Liu Shaoqi also took a car to visit the city, visited the Smolny Palace, and watched the ballet "The Stone Flower."

    On December 3rd and 4th, people everywhere in Leningrad were talking about the visit of the Chinese delegation. Newspapers published a large number of news and photos of the delegation's activities. Radio stations and television stations broadcast the live broadcast of the mass rally at the Kirov Factory.

    The time to say goodbye to Leningrad had come. Although the short winter day in Leningrad was already dusk and snowflakes were flying, when the radio broadcast announced that the distinguished Chinese guests were being bid farewell, the people of Leningrad quickly came to Nevsky Prospekt. A mass rally celebrating Sino-Soviet friendship was being held on Palace Square, and Chinese music was playing in the square. Nevsky Prospekt was brightly lit, and citizens of all ages lined the streets, reluctantly saying goodbye to Comrade Liu Shaoqi and the Chinese Party and Government Delegation. Along the way, people crowded into the center of the street, leaving only a narrow passage. The motorcade of the Chinese delegation moved slowly, taking nearly half an hour to reach the station.

    On the morning of the 5th, when the delegation arrived in Minsk, the capital of the Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, it happened to be the Soviet Constitution Day. On this day, the entire city was decorated with lanterns and festoons, filled with joy, and the national flags of China, the Soviet Union, and the Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic were flying everywhere. Minsk, like Leningrad, warmly and grandly received the distinguished Chinese guests. The people of Minsk said, "The arrival of the distinguished Chinese guests has added luster to Constitution Day." From the square to Stalin Avenue, more than three kilometers to the residence, the dense crowds lining the streets forced the cars to drive slowly. The enthusiastic people of Minsk each held a small national flag in their hands. They smiled and extended their hands into the car windows to shake hands with the Chinese comrades, and threw flowers and small flags to the guests from China. The welcoming crowd kept chanting slogans such as "Friendship," "Hurrah," "Welcome the Chinese Party and Government Delegation," "Welcome dear Comrade Liu Shaoqi," and other slogans. On this day, the people of Minsk celebrated two festivals: one was Constitution Day, commemorating the victory of socialism, and the other was the festival of Sino-Soviet friendship.

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi and the Chinese Party and Government Delegation visited the urban area in Minsk and met with collective farmers. When Chairman Liu Shaoqi arrived at the Gastev Collective Farm not far from Minsk, flags were flying everywhere on the farm, and the villagers specially made banners written in both Chinese and Russian. According to ancient traditional customs, after Chairman Liu Shaoqi got out of the car, a female villager presented him with bread and salt. Then a group of innocent and lively teenagers holding flowers and musical instruments, who were students from the farm's music school, ran over to sing Chinese, Russian, and Belorussian folk songs to the distinguished guests.

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi was very interested in the great efforts and heroic labor made by the villagers of the Gastev Farm in developing the farm's economy. In the livestock farm, Chairman Liu asked the milkmaids present about their work and living conditions.

    Just like in the Kirov Factory, the farm held a mass rally to welcome Chairman Liu. The villagers who spoke at the meeting enthusiastically praised Sino-Soviet friendship and the great achievements of the Chinese people, the Soviet people, and the Belorussian people. In his speech, Chairman Liu also praised the farm's achievements, commended agricultural labor models, and commended the villagers and the Belorussian people for their heroic labor in resisting fascist aggression and in restoring and developing the economy.

    Chairman Liu and the Chinese Party and Government Delegation attended a grand musical evening at the Minsk Opera and Ballet Theatre. When Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Chairman Brezhnev raised their tightly clasped hands high, the audience cheered and shouted the slogan "Sino-Soviet friendship lasts forever."

    After leaving the Opera and Ballet Theatre, the distinguished guests headed directly to the station. At this time, the streets were brightly lit and crowded with people, as if all the residents of Minsk, young and old, had come to the main streets of Minsk. The crowd was even denser than in the early morning. Shop assistants in white clothes, mothers holding children, elderly people leaning on canes, and lively and enthusiastic young people all came to bid farewell to the Chinese delegation. Some people even brought musical instruments to play music, and everywhere there were cheers of "Friendship" and "Goodbye."

    On the evening of the 6th, a wonderful ballet performance was held for our Party and Government Delegation at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. Famous retired actress Ulanova returned to the stage to welcome the distinguished Chinese guests. She performed four dances in the ballet "Les Sylphides," and her wonderful performance was warmly praised by the Chinese guests and the audience.

    Another famous actress, Lepeshinskaya, like Ulanova, had also visited China. Many people in Moscow had heard her enthusiastic report about visiting China. When this actress, familiar to the Chinese people, appeared on the stage, applause immediately rang out in the hall. Her performance of "Walpurgis Night" received many enthusiastic applauses. After the performance, Chairman Liu Shaoqi went on stage to shake hands warmly with the actors and presented them with flower baskets.

    The Likhachev Automobile Plant in Moscow and the Changchun Automobile Plant in China have a close friendship. The friendship between these two factories, like a bright mirror, reflects the friendship and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. Krylov, the director of the Likhachev Automobile Plant, told our delegation that it was very interesting that the first automobile produced by the Likhachev Automobile Plant participated in the celebration of the seventh anniversary of the October Revolution, and the first automobile of the Changchun Automobile Plant was also born when the Chinese people were celebrating the seventh anniversary of the founding of the country. This unintentional event can be said to be a good story in the great friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China. Chairman Liu Shaoqi said that he had visited this factory eleven years ago, so now when he came to visit, he could see the changes in the Likhachev Automobile Plant over the past eleven years. The factory director introduced the production situation to Chairman Liu in detail, and he told Chairman Liu that the Likhachev Automobile Plant would become a typical mechanized factory in the Seven-Year Plan.

    In the various workshops of the Likhachev Automobile Plant, the workers welcomed the distinguished guests from China with unparalleled enthusiasm. They scrambled to squeeze to the side of the workshop passages to warmly applaud and cheer the delegation. There were the most female workers in the third casting workshop. When Chairman Liu arrived, they temporarily put down the tools in their hands and scrambled to greet the delegation and shouted together "Friendship!" "Friendship!" "Friendship!"

    On the afternoon of December 7, more than 12,000 people from various districts of Moscow crowded the huge Central Lenin Stadium Sports Palace. The Sino-Soviet friendship mass rally held here once again demonstrated the great friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China. Although the venue was very large, it could not accommodate all the participants. Many people watched and listened to the proceedings of the rally from television and radio broadcasts. At 2:30 in the afternoon, when Chairman Liu Shaoqi appeared on the rostrum of the conference in the company of Soviet party and government leaders, the emotions of the conference participants were extremely high, and many people could not help but shout, "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!" Thousands of Chinese national flags flew up and down. Chairman Liu Shaoqi's hour-long speech at the meeting deeply touched the hearts of the people. His speech was interrupted by enthusiastic applause more than forty times. When Chairman Liu Shaoqi talked about his first visit to the Soviet Union in 1921 in his speech, the hall livened up, and people were very interested in Chairman Liu's memories. When he said, "In the struggle of the people of all countries for the cause of world peace, national liberation, democratic freedom, and socialism, the unity of socialist camp and the unity of the international communist movement are the most important guarantees for victory. Unity is life, unity is strength, and unity is victory," the emotions in the hall reached a boiling point, and people burst into applause like a storm before the translator had completely translated. When Chairman Liu finished his speech and shook hands and embraced Chairman Brezhnev, the thunderous applause in the hall lasted for several minutes. This meeting was broadcast live to the whole country by Moscow Radio. Moscow Television also broadcast the live broadcast. Moscow citizens who did not attend the mass rally saw the enthusiastic scenes of the rally from the television program and were deeply moved by Chairman Liu's speech.

    When Chairman Liu and members of our delegation joined hands with Soviet party and government leaders, many people were deeply moved by this vivid scene of the close unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

    On the morning of the 8th, the delegation departed from Moscow. On this morning, from Lenin Hills, through the long Lenin Avenue, all the way to the southwestern suburbs of Moscow, people disregarded the cold of the morning and came early to bid farewell to the distinguished Chinese guests. After Chairman Liu and Chairman Brezhnev came out of the villa in open-top cars, they immediately plunged into the embrace of the farewell crowd. Cheers and slogans broke through the silence of the Moscow morning.

    At Vnukovo Airport, Chairman Liu and Soviet party and government leaders shook hands and said goodbye one by one. The masses gathered at the airport waved enthusiastically to bid farewell to Chairman Liu and members of our Party and Government Delegation. When the "Tu-104" silver swallow carrying the distinguished guests left the runway, countless arms of the farewell crowd waved, and they shouted, "Have a safe trip!"

    Chairman Liu made a short stop in Omsk on his way back to China, and then arrived in Irkutsk on the night of the 8th. Although it was very cold, there were still many people at the airport welcoming him. Chairman Liu stayed in this emerging large industrial city for one night and one day, visited a huge hydroelectric power station there and Lake Baikal, and then took off for Beijing in the evening.

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi and the Chinese Party and Government Delegation he led brought the great friendship of the Chinese people to the Soviet people, and now he brings the great friendship of the Soviet people to the Chinese people. At this moment, Chairman Liu Shaoqi's strong and loud voice continues to reverberate in people's ears: "The whole world can see that in the common struggle against Imperialism and to realize communism, no matter the weather, the Chinese people will always stand with the Soviet people."

    中藓友谊  万古长青
    ——记中国党政代表团在苏联各地的访问
    本报记者　李楠　　崔永昌
    12月3日早晨，当黎明尚未降临到列宁格勒这座北方的城市的时候，在几公里长的?瓦大街上已经聚集了欢笑的人群，一排排男女青年手里拿着中国国旗，高举着用红布制成的大幅标语，等待着欢迎中国的贵宾。
    ?瓦大街这条著名的街道，在黎明前的时分显得异常朴素而美丽，在街道两旁，中苏两国的国旗在微风中飘扬，人们手中举着的大幅标语“欢迎您，亲爱的刘少奇同志”，“苏中友谊万岁”，为街道增添了节日的气氛。
    列宁格勒这座革命摇篮的城市，对于我国人民是非常亲切的。中华人民共和国成立十一年来，这个城市和我国建立了密切的友谊联系。这里有许多人到过我国，亲眼看到了我国人民在党的领导下建设社会主义的伟大成就和动人事迹，列宁格勒的许多工厂为我国提供了机器设备，许多专家也曾到过我国的许多重要建设工地，给了我们各种各样的帮助，列宁格勒的许多高等学校里还有我国的留学生。因此，当我国党政代表团来到列宁格勒时，这个英雄城市的人民怀着特别亲切的心情，迎接中国的贵宾。
    在列宁格勒的“莫斯科”车站，洋溢着一片节日的气氛。大厅里高悬着毛泽东、刘少奇、赫鲁晓夫和勃列日?夫的大幅画像，以及用中俄两种文字书写的大幅标语：“苏中两国伟大人民永恒的、牢不可破的友谊万岁！”
    早晨九时七分，当专车驶进站台，刘少奇主席在勃列日?夫主席和弗·罗·科兹洛夫同志陪同下走出车厢时，周围响起了一片欢呼声，在车站前的巨大广场上是人山人海。当刘少奇主席向欢迎的人群挥手致意时，列宁格勒人情不自禁地摇着手中的五星红旗高呼：“苏中友好万岁！”雄壮的“乌拉”声像一个个巨大的浪头一样，随着刘主席乘坐的车辆沿着列宁格勒的街道滚滚传开，许多人还走近代表团的汽车，用不太流利的中国话热情地问候：“同志，你好！”
    这一天，我国党政代表团与基洛夫工厂工人的见面给人们留下了难忘的印象，它再一次展示了苏中两国人民的伟大友谊。基洛夫工厂是一座有着长久优秀革命历史的工厂。伟大的列宁在这里发表过许多著名的演说，从这个工厂中央的场地上，列宁的雄伟的声音传向了全世界。现在，在列宁当年发表演说的地方，树立了一座巨大的列宁雕像。
    还在刘主席来到工厂以前两个多小时，中国客人要到来的消息便在工人中广泛传开。许多作完了夜班的工人又赶了回来，参加同我国党政代表团的会见。许多退休的老工人也赶到工厂。参加过三次革命的老布尔什维克尼基弗里夫感到特别兴奋，他向记者说：“刘少奇同志能够分出时间参观我们的工厂，这对我们工厂来说是件大事。”他还向记者问起毛泽东同志的健康情况。站在他旁边的一个有四十多年党龄的老共产党员基亚科娃也说：“我们老一辈的人是知道革命前和革命后初期的困难的，因此，中国人民在建设中的每一个成就，都使我们感到高兴和骄傲。”
    刘主席来到工厂后，在勃列日?夫和弗·罗·科兹洛夫和工厂厂长伊萨耶夫陪同下参观了两个机械装备车间。代表团所到之处，到处是一片欢呼和鼓掌声。在透平车间里，当刘主席走到先进工人科兹洛夫面前时，同他进行了亲切的谈话。科兹洛夫向刘主席谈了工作情况，并且说：“您来到我们工厂，我们非常高兴。我们对中国人民在实行国家工业化中取得的成绩非常钦佩。”在工厂里，刘主席还同先进生产者卡拉谢夫和参加过国内战争的老布尔什维克季拉科娃谈了话。
    十二时，在工厂里举行了全厂工人的群众大会。参加过十月革命的老工人米罗什尼科夫在会上热情地说，工人们在攻打冬宫时深深地相信，伟大列宁所举的旗帜将在全世界飘扬。而现在这样的时间已经到来了。当刘少奇主席讲话时，会场上响起了经久不息的热烈掌声。工人们高呼：“向伟大而勤劳的中国人民致敬！”、“光荣的中国共产党万岁！”大会结束时，与会者齐声高唱国际歌。
    刘少奇主席等中国客人在“阿芙乐尔号”巡洋舰上的参观也是非常动人的。还在客人来到以前，舰上的水兵们已经在凛冽的寒风中排好队伍等候了。刘少奇主席仔细地听了舰长讲述这只军舰的英雄的历史。水手们解开了朝向冬宫的一尊大炮上的炮衣，向刘主席介绍说，就是这尊大炮放出了攻击冬宫的信号，宣布了新的纪元的开始。舰长把刘少奇主席介绍给一位白发苍苍的老人，他就是“阿芙乐尔号”巡洋舰上的第一任政委。刘少奇主席和他亲切地握手交谈说：“阿芙乐尔”的炮声惊醒了中国人民，也惊醒了全世界的劳动人民，在“阿芙乐尔”炮声之前，我们中国人不知道马克思，不知道列宁。“阿芙乐尔”炮响之后，中国人才知道列宁和布尔什维克。这时站在旁边的弗·罗·科兹洛夫说：“就是别雷谢夫同志当年直接下命令开炮的”。刘少奇主席向别雷谢夫说：“谢谢你”。别雷谢夫老人非常感动。刘少奇主席特地和他一起照了相。
    在列宁格勒，刘少奇主席还乘车参观了市容，参观了斯莫尔尼宫，看了芭蕾舞剧《宝石花》。
    12月3日和4日的列宁格勒，人们到处谈论着中国代表团的光临。报纸大量刊载代表团活动的新闻和照片。广播电台和电视台转播了基洛夫工厂的群众大会的实况。
    同列宁格勒告别的时候到来了。虽然列宁格勒短促的冬日已经是黄昏，雪花正在飘舞，但是当无线电广播宣布欢送中国贵宾的时候，列宁格勒人很快地就来到了?瓦大街。冬宫广场上，正在举行庆祝苏中友谊的群众性的晚会，广场上响着中国的音乐。?瓦大街上灯火通明，老老少少的市民夹道依依不舍地送别了刘少奇同志和中国党政代表团。沿途人们拥到街道的中心，仅留下一条很窄的通道，中国代表团的车队缓缓而行，走了近半小时才到达车站。
    5日早晨，代表团来到白俄罗斯共和国首都明斯克时，恰逢苏联的宪法节。这天，全城张灯结彩，喜气洋洋，中国、苏联和白俄罗斯共和国的国旗到处飘扬。明斯克像列宁格勒一样热情隆重地接待了中国贵宾。明斯克人说，
  “中国贵宾们的到来给宪法节增添了光彩。”从广场直到住地三公里多的斯大林大街上，密密麻麻的夹道欢迎的群众使汽车只得缓缓行驶。热情的明斯克人每个人手中拿着一面小的国旗，他们笑容满面，把手伸向汽车的玻璃窗里来同中国同志们握手，纷纷把鲜花和小旗抛给中国来的客人。欢迎的人群不断喊着“友谊”、“乌拉”、“欢迎中国党政代表团”、“欢迎亲爱的刘少奇同志”等口号。这一天，明斯克人过了两个节日：一个是纪念社会主义胜利的宪法节，一个是苏中友谊的节日。
    刘少奇主席和中国党政代表团在明斯克参观了市区，并同集体农民见了面。当刘少奇主席来到离明斯克不远的加斯特罗集体农庄时，农庄到处旗帜飘扬，庄员们特地赶制了用中文和俄文书写的标语。按照古老的传统风俗，在刘少奇主席下车之后，一位女庄员向他敬献了面包和盐。接着跑来了一群拿着鲜花和乐器的天真活泼的少年儿童，他们是农庄音乐学校的学生，特地来向贵宾们演唱中国的、俄罗斯的、白俄罗斯的民间歌曲。
    加斯特罗农庄的庄员们在发展农庄经济方面所作的巨大努力和英勇劳动，使刘少奇主席感到很大的兴趣。在畜牧场里，刘主席询问了在场的挤奶员们的工作和生活情况。
    也像在基洛夫工厂一样，农庄举行了欢迎刘主席的群众大会。在会上讲话的庄员们热情地歌颂了苏中友谊，歌颂了中国人民、苏联人民和白俄罗斯人民的伟大成就。刘主席在讲话中也赞扬了农庄的成绩，表扬农业劳动模范，表扬了农庄庄员和白俄罗斯人民在反击法西斯侵略和在恢复和发展经济的过程中所付出的英勇劳动。
    刘主席和中国党政代表团在明斯克歌舞剧院出席了盛大的音乐晚会。当刘少奇主席和勃列日?夫主席把互相紧握着的手高高举起时，台下台上一片欢呼，人们高喊“苏中友谊万古长青”的口号。
    从歌舞剧院出来，贵宾们直接向车站出发。这时街道上灯火通明，人山人海，仿佛全城老老少少的居民都来到了明斯克的主要街道上。人层比清早还要密。穿白衣服的商店售货员、抱着孩子的母亲、扶着手杖的老年人、活泼热情的年青人都来欢送中国代表团。有的人还特意带来乐器奏乐，到处是一片“友好”和“再见”的欢呼声。
    6日晚，在莫斯科大剧院为我国党政代表团举行了精彩的芭蕾舞演出。已经退休了的著名演员乌兰诺娃为了欢迎中国贵宾，今天重新登台，她在芭蕾舞“仙女们”中一连表演了四个舞蹈，她的精彩表演获得了中国贵宾和观众们的热烈赞扬。
    另外一位著名演员列皮辛斯卡娅也同乌兰诺娃一样是访问过我国的，莫斯科的许多人听过她的关于访问中国的充满热情的报告。当这位中国人民熟悉的演员出现在台上时，大厅里立刻响起了掌声。她所表演的“瓦尔普基之夜”获得了多次热烈的鼓掌。演出结束后，刘少奇主席走上台去和演员们热烈握手，并且赠送了花篮。
    莫斯科李哈乔夫汽车厂和我国长春汽车厂有着密切的友谊，这两个工厂的友谊像一面明镜一样，反映了苏中两国的友谊合作。李哈乔夫汽车厂厂长克雷洛夫向我国代表团说，非常有意思的是：李哈乔夫汽车厂生产的第一部汽车参加了十月革命七周年的庆祝典礼，而长春汽车厂的第一辆汽车也是正值中国人民庆祝建国七周年的时候诞生的，这件不约而同的事情可以说是苏中两国人民伟大友谊中的一段佳话。刘少奇主席说，他在十一年前曾经到过这个工厂，因此现在来参观，可以看出十一年来李哈乔夫汽车厂的变化。工厂厂长向刘主席详细地介绍了生产情况，他告诉刘主席说，李哈乔夫汽车厂在七年计划中将要成为典型的机械化工厂。
    在李哈乔夫汽车厂的各个车间中，工人们以无比的热情欢迎来自中国的贵宾，他们争先恐后地挤到车间的通道旁向代表团热烈鼓掌欢呼。第三铸造车间女工最多，当刘主席来到时，她们暂时放下了手中的工具，争着向代表团问好，并且一齐喊着“友谊！”“友谊！”“友谊！”
    12月7日下午，来自莫斯科各区的一万二千多人挤满了巨大的中央列宁运动场体育宫。这里举行的苏中友好群众大会，再一次展示了苏中两国人民的伟大友谊。会场虽然很大，但是并不能容下所有的参加者，许多人从电视和无线电广播中看到和听到了大会的进行情况。下午二时半，当刘少奇主席在苏联党政领导人的陪同下出现在大会主席台时，大会参加者的情绪异常高涨，许多人情不自禁地高呼：“苏中友好万岁！”千万面中国国旗上下飞舞。刘少奇主席在会上所作的长达一小时的讲话，每个字都深深地打动了人们的心，他的讲话被热烈的掌声打断了四十多次。当刘少奇主席在讲话中谈到1921年他第一次来到苏联的情况时，大厅里活跃起来，人们对刘主席的回忆感到极大的兴趣。当他讲到“在各国人民争取世界和平、民族解放、民主自由和社会主义事业的斗争中，社会主义阵营的团结和国际共产主义运动的团结是取得胜利的最重要保证。团结就是生命，团结就是力量，团结就是胜利。”时，大厅中的情绪达到了沸腾点，人们还没等译员完全译完，便暴风雨般地鼓起掌来。当刘主席结束了讲话，同勃列日?夫主席握手拥抱时，大厅中的雷鸣般的掌声达数分钟之久。这次大会由莫斯科广播电台向全国播送实况。莫斯科电视台也转播了实况，没有参加群众大会的莫斯科市民从电视节目中看到了大会的热烈情景，并深深为刘主席的讲话所感动。
    当刘主席和我国代表团团员们同苏联党政领导人共同携起手来时，许多人都被这种中苏两国人民亲密团结的生动场面所深深感动。
    8日早晨，代表团同莫斯科离别了。这一天早晨，从列宁山上经过漫长的列宁大街，一直到莫斯科西南区市郊，人们不顾早晨的寒冷，很早就赶来欢送中国贵宾。刘主席和勃列日?夫主席坐着敞篷车从别墅出来以后，立刻就投入了欢送人群的怀抱，欢呼声和口号声冲破了莫斯科清晨的寂静。
    在伏努科夫机场上，刘主席和苏联党政领导人一一握手告别，聚集在机场上的群众热烈挥手欢送刘主席和我国党政代表团团员。当“图—104”银燕载着贵宾离开跑道时，送行人群的无数手臂挥动了起来，他们高呼：“一路平安！”
    刘主席在返国途中在鄂木斯克稍事停留后，在8日夜晚到达伊尔库次克。虽然天气很冷，机场上仍有许多群众在欢迎。刘主席在这个新兴的大工业城市逗留了一个晚上和一个白天，参观了那里的一个巨大的水力发电站和贝加尔湖，然后在傍晚时分起飞回北京。
    刘少奇主席和他率领的中国党政代表团把中国人民的伟大友谊带给了苏联人民，现在，他又把苏联人民的伟大友谊带给中国人民。此刻，刘少奇主席的坚强而宏亮的声音继续在人们的耳际回旋：“全世界都可以看到，在反对帝国主义和实现共产主义的共同斗争中，无论风里，雨里，中国人民都将永远同苏联人民站在一起。”
