Xinhua News Agency, Paris, News - The French government announced on the 8th the content of the "referendum" proposed by De Gaulle regarding his Algerian policy, and declared that the "referendum" would be held in France and Algeria on January 8th next year.

The so-called "referendum" planned by De Gaulle is yet another trick played after France's policy of aggression against Algeria fell into increasing difficulty. He attempts to deceive the people of France and Algeria through this vote, ease the contradictions within the French ruling group on the Algerian issue, and use this to stabilize his increasingly unstable rule and continue the colonial war against Algeria.

While announcing the "referendum," the French National Assembly debated the Algerian issue on the 7th and 8th. French Prime Minister Debré's speech exposed the essence of the Algerian "public administrative body" that De Gaulle intends to establish. He said that this institution "will not harm France's power (in Algeria)" and will "guarantee" that the French (colonialists) there "participate in the joint management of Algerian affairs."

Debré reiterated that France would not give up Algeria, saying arrogantly that "there has never been an Algerian nation or state." He stated that the so-called "referendum" on the issue of "self-determination" would only be held after the Algerian people laid down their weapons and surrendered.

Debré emphasized that France would continue its colonial war to suppress the Algerian national independence movement, saying that this armed "appeasement" is "a long-term task."

French National Assembly Communist Party member Waldeck Rochet spoke during the debate on the 7th, expressing opposition to De Gaulle's "referendum." He said that the policy that De Gaulle wants to approve through the "referendum" is contrary to peace and true self-determination, and it will lead to the continuation of the war.

    戴高乐政府玩弄新花招
    企图以“公民投票”欺骗阿尔及利亚人民
    德勃雷承认法国要继续进行侵阿殖民战争
    据新华社巴黎讯　法国政府8日公布了戴高乐提出将要就他的阿尔及利亚政策举行的“公民投票”的内容，并且宣布“公民投票”将在明年1月8日在法国和阿尔及利亚举行。
    戴高乐策划的这个所谓“公民投票”，是法国侵略阿尔及利亚的政策越来越陷入困境之后所玩弄的又一个花招。他企图通过这个投票来欺骗法国和阿尔及利亚人民，缓和法国统治集团内部在阿尔及利亚问题上的矛盾，并借此来稳定他日趋不稳的统治，继续进行对阿尔及利亚的殖民战争。
    在宣布举行“公民投票”的同时，法国国民议会在7日和8日辩论了阿尔及利亚问题。法国总理德勃雷的发言暴露了戴高乐打算成立的阿尔及利亚“公共行政机构”的本质，他说，这个机构“不会损害法国（在阿尔及利亚）的权力”，并且要“保障”在那里的法国人（殖民主义分子）“参加对阿尔及利亚事务的共同管理”。
    德勃雷再次表明法国不放弃阿尔及利亚，他狂妄地说，“从来没有存在过一个阿尔及利亚民族或国家”，他表示要在阿尔及利亚人民放下武器投降以后才举行所谓“自决”问题的“公民投票”。
    德勃雷强调法国要继续进行它镇压阿尔及利亚民族独立运动的殖民战争，他说，这种武装“绥靖”是“一个长期的工作”。
    法国国民议会共产党议员瓦德克·罗歇7日在辩论时发言表示反对戴高乐的“公民投票”，他说，戴高乐想用“公民投票”来批准的政策是违背和平和真正的自决的，它要导致战争的延续。
