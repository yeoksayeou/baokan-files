　　Not Yielding to the Harsh Winter

　　Nature brings unfavorable factors to winter transportation: water dries up in the south and freezes in the north, affecting ship navigation; wind and snow harass, and the road is slippery and difficult to travel, affecting driving speed. "Old Man Heaven" wants transportation workers to transport less or stop transporting in winter. On the contrary, the people demand that transportation workers transport more and better in winter. Agricultural and sideline products such as grain, cotton, and oil must be transported to the cities in winter; agricultural production materials and living materials also need to be transported to the countryside before the spring plowing. What to do? Should we listen to "Old Man Heaven" and transport less or stop transporting in winter? No! The workers of the wooden sailboat transportation department in Hunan Province have spoken. They want to "not reduce production in small droughts and not interrupt navigation in large droughts," and they have indeed done so.

　　The facts in Hunan Province show that as long as we have a full estimate of the unfavorable conditions and take measures in advance, we can overcome nature in many cases. If the riverbed water level is shallow, we can use improved hull designs, increase buoyancy, build dams to block water, and dredge the shoals and dig mud to control it. The south can overcome drought, and the north can also overcome freezing by vigorously developing ice sled and sledge transportation, turning dead water into a living road.

　　The unfavorable conditions that nature brings to us are objective realities. But man is by no means powerless. As long as we rely closely on the masses, we can overcome difficulties. The same is true for winter transportation work.

    不向严冬屈服
    大自然给冬季运输带来了不利因素：南方水枯，北方封冻，影响船舶航行；风雪侵扰，路滑难行，影响行车速度，“天老爷”想叫运输部门职工在冬季少运、停运。相反，人民要求运输部门职工在冬季运得更多、更好。粮食、棉花、油料等农副产品，要在冬季运进城市；农业生产资料和生活资料，也有很多要赶在春耕之前运往农村。怎么办？是听“天老爷”的话，在冬季少运、停运么？不！湖南省木帆船运输部门职工说话了。他们要“小枯不减产，大枯不断航”，果然做到了。
    湖南省的事实表明：只要我们对不利条件有充分估计，预先采取措施，在很多情况下是可以战胜自然的。河床水位浅，用改良船型，增加浮力，筑坝堵水，疏滩掏泥等办法，可以制服之。南方能够战胜枯水，北方也能够战胜封冻，大搞冰撬、爬犁运输，变死水为活路。
    大自然带给我们的不利条件，是客观存在。但人决不是无能为力的。只要紧紧依靠群众，就可以战胜困难。冬季运输工作也是如此。
