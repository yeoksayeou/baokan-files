    Being Down-to-Earth
    Chen Shi
    In the communes, one can often hear leaders praising a certain village branch secretary for their down-to-earth work, or criticizing a certain team for not being down-to-earth enough. Indeed, the four characters "za zha shi shi" (扎扎实实, meaning "down-to-earth") are highly comprehensive, encompassing many meanings. How does one actually be down-to-earth? Some say: going into production to lead production, "being both commander and soldier"; going into life to arrange life, "politics entering the canteen, cadres going down to the kitchen," and so on. These are all developments of the Party's traditional work style, therefore, being down-to-earth also means being thorough.

    True, being down-to-earth and being thorough cannot be separated. "If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch tiger cubs?" Without thorough effort, closing your eyes and ears, it is difficult to do a good job, let alone be down-to-earth. But being thorough is only the first step to being down-to-earth. To use an analogy, many comrades carry their bedding rolls, step onto the front lines, work in the fields, eat in the canteen, and sleep in the feeding sheds. One might say everything is ready, but lacking only the east wind, unable to steer the rudder steadily, the expected goal is usually difficult to achieve, and it still doesn't count as being down-to-earth. "Policy and tactics are the life of the Party," "Only when the Party's policies and tactics are all on the right track is the victory of the Chinese revolution possible." These instructions from Chairman Mao teach us that only by borrowing the "east wind" of policy, and like a helmsman steadily grasping the tools in our hands and using them well, transforming the Party's policies into the conscious action of the masses, can we fully mobilize the positive factors hidden in the masses, creating an overwhelming momentum, and making the cause of socialist construction advance rapidly, wave upon wave.

    Recently, I heard a grassroots cadre from a disaster area say, "The Party's policy is like a root, with deep roots, the leaves are lush and the flowers are even redder." This is indeed their profound experience in implementing the Party's policy. This year, their area suffered a major flood due to heavy rains, submerging most of the crops. However, when the masses were mobilized, the difficulties were readily solved, and the entire team reduced the yield reduction from 60% to 20%. How were the masses "mobilized"? On the one hand, it relied on the awareness of the masses, and more importantly, on the other hand: it relied on the organization and mobilization of the leaders. What to use to mobilize? Policy is the driving force. In order to solve problems realistically, the Party branch organized cadres from various small teams and experienced farmers to go deep into the fields, inspect the disaster situation of various crops one by one, and study specific revision methods, thereby achieving satisfaction from both small team cadres and commune members, and boosting the enthusiasm of the masses for production again and again. As a result, the yield caught up.

    Only when cadres understand the Party's policies and are determined to implement them; when the masses understand the policies and resolutely demand the realization of the Party's policies, can the leadership and the masses be combined from top to bottom and from bottom to top, forming a broad and enthusiastic mass movement, and effectively implement and carry out the Party's policies. And once the leadership grasps the "root" of policy and deeply roots it in the masses, it will bloom with bright flowers and bear rich fruits. The Party organizations in the disaster area have both the firm belief of "recovering what has been lost" and the determination to "thoroughly implement and carry out the policy." Therefore, the leadership and the masses are united as one, winning the victory in the struggle against nature. This is an example of being down-to-earth in work.

    扎扎实实

    在公社里，常常可以听到一些领导人赞扬某村支部书记的工作扎实。或者是批评某队的工作不够扎实。的确，“扎扎实实”这四个字是富有概括性的，它包涵着很多意思。究竟怎样做才算扎实呢？有人说：到生产中去领导生产，“又当司令又当兵”；到生活中去安排生活，“政治进食堂，干部下伙房”等等，都是党的传统办事作风的发扬，因此，扎实也就是深入。
    不错，扎实和深入不能分家，不入虎穴，焉得虎子，没有深入的功夫，闭目塞听，要想做好工作就很困难，更不用说扎实了。但深入毕竟还只是扎实的第一步。打个比方，不少同志背起铺盖卷，踏上第一线，到田里干，在食堂吃，进饲养棚睡，真可说万事皆备了吧，但只欠东风，掌不稳舵，预想的目的照例难以达到，仍算不得扎实。“政策和策略是党的生命”，“只有党的政策和策略全部走上正轨，中国革命才有胜利的可能。”毛主席的这些指示，就是教导我们只有借政策之“东风”，并且像舵手一样稳稳掌握自己手里的工具，并很好地运用，变党的政策为群众的自觉行动，才能把群众中蕴藏的积极因素充分调动起来，造成汹涌澎湃之势，使社会主义建设事业乘风破浪地、一浪高一浪地向前跃进。
    最近，听到一位灾区的基层干部说过“党的政策是条根，根深叶茂花更红”这样一句话，这的确是他们在执行党的政策过程中的深切体会。今年，他们那里由于大雨成灾，淹没了大部分庄稼，但是，群众动起来，困难迎刃而解，全队由减产六成降为二成。群众是如何“动”起来的呢？这一面是靠群众的觉悟、更重要的是另一面：靠领导的组织和发动。拿什么去发动？政策是动力。为实事求是地解决问题，党总支组织各小队干部和老农深入田间，逐块检查了各种作物的受灾情况，并研究了具体修订办法，从而达到小队干部和社员双满意，群众生产劲头一鼓再鼓。结果，产量赶了上来。
    只有干部了解了党的政策，下决心贯彻党的政策；群众了解了政策，坚决要求实现党的政策，这样就会使领导和群众由上而下和由下而上地结合起来，形成广泛热烈的群众运动，切实有效地执行和贯彻党的政策。而一旦领导抓起政策这条“根”，又深深地扎到群众中去，就会开出鲜艳的花，结出丰硕的果。灾区党组织既有把“失去的夺回来”的坚强信念，又有把“政策贯彻执行到底”的决心，因而领导和群众拧成一股绳，赢得与老天搏斗的胜利，这正是扎扎实实工作的一个例子。
