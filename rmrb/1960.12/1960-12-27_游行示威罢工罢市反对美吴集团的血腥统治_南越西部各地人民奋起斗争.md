Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 25th: According to reports in local newspapers, since mid-September, the struggle of the people in western South Vietnam against the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique has taken on a new development. In the fifteen days from September 15th to 30th alone, 300,000 people participated in the struggle.

During this period, from cities to villages, everywhere were processions of demonstrators and leaflets and slogans. Countless strikes and market strikes occurred. In Ca Mau, Vinh Long, Sa Dec, Soc Trang, Bac Lieu and other places, revolutionary red flags and slogans and leaflets against the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique appeared.

In Can Tho, Tra Vinh, Vinh Long, Soc Trang, Ca Mau, and other places, tens of thousands of people held hundreds of demonstrations of varying scales against the barbaric persecution by the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique, in which more than ten demonstrations were attended by one thousand to six thousand people.

Some people who were forcibly relocated to "agrovilles" by the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique resolutely opposed the persecution by the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique. About 70% of the residents in many "agrovilles" fled, greatly undermining the conspiracy of the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique.

    在芹苴、茶荣、永隆、朔庄、金瓯等地，成千上万人民举行了上百次规模大小不同的反对美吴集团野蛮迫害的示威游行，其中十多次示威有一千至六千人参加。
    一些被美吴集团强迫迁到“稠密区”的人民坚决反对美吴集团的迫害，许多“稠密区”有70％左右的居民逃了出来，使美吴集团的阴谋受到很大打击。
