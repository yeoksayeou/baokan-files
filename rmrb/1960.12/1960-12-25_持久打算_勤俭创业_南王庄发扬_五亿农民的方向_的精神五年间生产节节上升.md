    Sustained Planning and Frugal Entrepreneurship
    —Production at Nanwangzhuang Rises Steadily in the Five Years of Promoting the Spirit of "The Direction for 500 Million Farmers"

    The three poor peasant households in Nanwangzhuang, Shen County, Hebei—Wang Yukun, Wang Xiaoqi, and Wang Xiaopang—whom Chairman Mao praised as "the direction for 500 million farmers," have adhered to the path of collectivization since 1955. Five years have passed, and under the leadership of the Party, they have guided the masses in frugal entrepreneurship, bringing about earth-shaking changes in Nanwangzhuang.

    Five years ago, Nanwangzhuang was known as "White Sand Beach" and "Crouching Dragon Ridge." The Hutuo River changed its course here three times, leaving behind several river gullies and sixty-four large sand dunes. Year after year, wind and sand were a hazard, and harvests were very low. The elderly described the sand beach in those years as "Nanwangzhuang, a large sand beach, where the sky is invisible when the wind blows, and crops are repeatedly planted but seedlings are incomplete, generations suffering." Today, in Nanwangzhuang, barren sandy land and hillocks have all been transformed into paddy fields, becoming fertile land with bumper harvests year after year. Since 1957, it has changed from a food-deficient area. In 1959, it achieved the targets set by the "National Program for Agricultural Development" eight years ahead of schedule. Although this year encountered the worst drought in seventy years, the harvests of both wheat and autumn crops still exceeded those of previous years.

    To Reverse the Situation

    "The Direction for 500 Million Farmers" became famous throughout the country, and many people came to visit in the winter of 1955. The commune members were delighted, but Yukun, Xiaoqi, and Xiaopang felt a great responsibility. Nanwangzhuang was still short of 89,000 jin of grain each year. Chairman Mao gave them such great honor, how could they change the poor conditions here? They studied this matter many times, and after discussing it over and over again, it all boiled down to one word: "Do it."

    The following year, Wang Yukun was invited to be a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and attended the Second Session of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC. During the meeting, Chairman Mao kindly asked Yukun: "How many households are there in your commune?" Yukun replied: "Three hundred and twenty-five households." Chairman Mao said: "It will be difficult to manage the family in the future, managing the whole village is much more difficult than managing the family of three poor peasants." Chairman Mao's concern made Wang Yukun unable to calm down for a long time. "How can I manage this family well?" He thought of how more than 100 poor peasant households in the village lived in the past, and thought of making good plans everywhere now... After thinking about it, he felt that to manage the family well and change the poor conditions, everything had to be planned for the long term.

    Yukun excitedly returned to Nanwangzhuang. Without even going home, he called Xiaoqi and Xiaopang together to convey Chairman Mao's words. Xiaoqi and Xiaopang suggested convening a Party branch committee meeting for everyone to discuss how to manage the family well. The next day, the 30th day of the twelfth lunar month, the Party branch committee held a meeting, analyzed the village's economic situation and the people's demands, and believed that a struggle goal should be set to move forward step by step. At Yukun's suggestion, the Party branch committee formulated a four-year plan to achieve the "National Program for Agricultural Development."

    This year, the labor enthusiasm of the villagers was very high, and the amount of work done was greater than in any previous year. Corn was cultivated twice with harrowing, three times with hoeing, and four times overall, and cotton was hoed seven times. All kinds of crops changed day by day, which was really pleasing. However, just when the corn was filling and the cotton was budding, and a bumper harvest seemed to be in sight, the flood of the Hutuo River, carrying mud and sand, struck. The corn was submerged, and the cotton was soaked. Nanwangzhuang suffered a flood that had not been seen in a century.

    The flood submerged the good crops, and some people reduced their confidence in achieving the plan. Wang Yukun, Wang Xiaoqi, and Wang Xiaopang did not waver, they firmly believed that they could overcome the disaster. Wang Yukun gathered Xiaoqi and Xiaopang together and said: "We must not slacken, if we retreat one foot, others will retreat ten feet. We must stand up straight and work firmly, and the masses will follow. With the Party and the masses, there is no Flame Mountain that cannot be crossed." Xiaoqi said: "Our ancestors have overcome many disasters. Right now, it's just a flood."

    At the mass meeting to discuss production and overcome the famine, Wang Yukun put forward ways to overcome the famine through production. He said: "In famine years, we must think about future years of bumper harvests; in years of bumper harvests, we must guard against reduced production and disasters. Although we have suffered a disaster this year, as long as sideline occupations are well-managed, we can overcome the famine and also lay a good foundation for next year's bumper harvest." The commune members felt that Yukun's opinions were correct, and they put forward many sideline production projects. They did not take out loans from the state, but organized eighteen types of sideline production. The Party branch divided the scope of operation, formulated a bonus distribution plan, and organized all the commune members into various sideline productions. They worked hard for a winter and a spring, overcame the disaster, paid off the commune members' investment accounts, and still had more than 8,000 yuan left.

    The victory of overcoming the famine through production was a good start to Nanwangzhuang's entrepreneurial history. In the winter of 1956, the commune members used the money from sideline production to buy two diesel engines and two water pumps; and used the income from the wood factory to buy more than 40,000 jin of chemical fertilizer, twenty-eight sheep, and fourteen pigs.

    Self-Reliance, Sustained Planning

    To truly reverse the situation in Nanwangzhuang, there must be sustained planning in running the commune frugally.

    To turn the idea of sustained planning into the action of the broad masses of commune members, it must be solved by the masses using their own methods to educate themselves. In 1957, there were two major things to be done: one was to control wind and sand (build windbreaks), and the other was to control drought (dig wells and level land). At the beginning of spring, the commune members devoted themselves to the labor of afforestation, well digging, leveling hills, filling ditches, and leveling land. Every task was very tense, and the commune members pulled carts to transport soil, carried baskets, and pushed carts to pound the soil. Some people were daunted. At this time, the cadres of the Jiaojiu Supply and Marketing Cooperative came to Wang Yukun and said: "The supply and marketing cooperative has brought in rubber-tired carts. If you want them, you can buy them on credit." Yukun thought about it from all aspects and decided not to, so he declined. Some commune members had a lot of opinions about Yukun's unwillingness to buy carts on credit. Wang Yukun asked the commune members such a question: "To change our poor conditions, should we rely on self-reliance or start by buying on credit?" He also said: "Some people laugh at us for being poor, what's the big deal? We bury our heads in hard work, and in three to five years, we can become rich. If we only care about showing off for the time being, we won't be able to transform the sandy land, and we won't be able to grow much grain in the fields, and others will give us even greater ridicule." Speaking of this, some people's thinking became clear, and people began to discuss: "Chairman Mao praised us because we have the ambition to take the socialist road, it is wrong to immediately buy mules and horses!" People who planned for the long term and started their businesses frugally said many inspiring words, and the discussion meeting naturally turned into a meeting to offer suggestions for doing a good job in current production.

    Adhere to the Principles of Frugal Entrepreneurship

    In the process of sustained planning and frugal entrepreneurship, there is also struggle.

    The matter occurred in the preparations for achieving the "National Program for Agricultural Development" ahead of schedule. Nanwangzhuang had accumulated more than 9,000 yuan. Regarding how to use these more than 9,000 yuan, the original Party branch secretary Wang Migui and the deputy secretary Wang Yukun had differences. Wang Migui advocated using more than 7,000 yuan to build a guesthouse and office, and to purchase a set of desks and file cabinets. Leave 2,000 yuan to support production. His reason was: "Now it is no longer Nanwangzhuang in 1956, and various settings should look like something. Otherwise, when outsiders see it, it will seem undignified." Wang Yukun's idea was different from Wang Migui's. Yukun said: "The people who visit don't look at the houses, they look at our crops. No matter how good the houses are for people to live in, if there is not much grain in the fields, that is really undignified." He advocated using all 9,000 yuan for production. Yukun's idea represented the opinions of some cadres, and Wang Migui's idea also represented the opinions of some cadres. Finally, the Party branch committee decided to let the masses discuss it and act according to the opinions of the masses.

    The commune member representative meeting was held. Each small team sent two or three representatives, as well as the leaders of ten small teams. The representatives spoke very enthusiastically, some started from analyzing the production situation, some talked about frugal entrepreneurship, some made suggestions, and some made criticisms. The representative said: "Digging wells and building houses, three years of surplus grain, although our living standards have improved, we don't have two years of surplus grain yet. If we start large-scale construction now, the result will be building houses and reducing grain, and the next step will be passive." Some representatives said: "The five-year plan has just taken the first step, and the second step has not yet been taken. People's enthusiasm for life is high, and cadres must not waver; we should use the money for building houses to dig machine wells and speed up the struggle to achieve the agricultural development program."

    The opinions of the representatives educated the cadres, and two ideas were unified into one idea - thinking about the next step and thinking about developing production. What is the key to achieving the agricultural development program ahead of schedule? - Water. More machine wells should be dug. At that time, an account was calculated that more than 9,000 yuan could dig three machine wells. With these three wells, the requirements of the program can be achieved in two years.

    With water, there were bumper harvests for two consecutive years. In 1958, the average grain yield per mu in the village was 285 jin. In 1959, the average grain yield per mu was 405 jin, exceeding the target set by the "National Program for Agricultural Development" eight years ahead of schedule.

    Save Expenses to the Greatest Extent

    In Nanwangzhuang, commune members strive to be diligent and households compare frugality, and they consider and reconsider spending a penny or using a bit of material. The formation of this frugal atmosphere, in addition to the idea of sustained planning and frugal entrepreneurship being deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, there are two other things that have moved people greatly.

    One thing is that a lieutenant in the Guangdong Military Region named Zhou Ruixing has been sending five yuan a month since he saw the article "The Direction for 500 Million Farmers" in the newspaper in 1955 to support the production and construction of Nanwangzhuang. Whenever people think of this lieutenant, they can't help but save and save again.

    Another thing is Yukun's frugality. Yukun is a model worker, the production team leader, the deputy secretary of the Party branch, and also the deputy director of the Nanwangzhuang Commune, and he has many outside activities, but his travel expenses and expenses during meetings are always surprisingly low. Last winter, he attended two months of meetings in Tianjin and Beijing. When he came back, he got off the train in Shulu and walked seventy miles home, and immediately went to the finance department to report the accounts.

    "Guosheng, calculate the accounts."

    "What is there to calculate? You didn't take a penny from the team when you went out."

    "There is an account to be calculated. The travel expenses for the way out were reimbursed by the public, this is one item; during the meeting, I saved the living expenses issued by the public, and saved more than 68 yuan, these two items totaled 75 yuan." Yukun said, while handing the money to the accountant.

    Guosheng said with emotion and embarrassment: "Which subject should this money be put into?"

    "Don't worry about the subject, just accept it."

    From 1957 to the present, Yukun has handed over more than 340 yuan of travel expenses and living expenses to the team.

    Team cadre Zhang Shuqing used to be a person who liked to eat and spend money. But every time he thought about spending an extra penny from the commune, he would think of Zhou Ruixing's enthusiastic support and Wang Yukun's honesty and integrity. So he also became frugal. Before autumn, the province held a mobile on-site meeting on sanitation work, and he went for more than twenty days. He should have spent four jiao a day, but when he came back to settle the accounts, he spent only three jiao and one fen a day. Commune members Wang Caibao and Zhang Shuqi went to Motou to pull coal, and they should have spent two yuan and four jiao on travel expenses, but they only spent one yuan and two jiao. There are many other things like this. From 1956 to the present, the money saved from the team's office expenses alone has bought four gas generators. People call this the "saving" machine.

    In addition to saving expenses to the greatest extent, the financial management of the production team also created an economic accounting system that combines production cost management and financial contracting. This system stipulates that there are quotas for the seeds, fertilizers, fuels (coal and oil for machines), consumption, machine tool repair and matching, small farm tool purchase costs, and the labor, animal power, and feed used in production for each crop. The quota is contracted to the small team, which mobilizes the small team members to reduce the enthusiasm of the production cost. The quota for the coal consumption of each boiler camel machine stipulates that it burns 1,000 jin of coal per day and irrigates 30 mu of land. Boiler camel machine operator Wang Yunchang felt that the coal consumption was high, and he and Yukun improved it while burning it, and summarized a "high shovel to raise coal" saving method. The coal consumption was reduced from 1,000 jin per day to 700 jin. Promoting this experience, only a few times of watering before the wheat harvest, the whole team saved more than 72,000 jin of coal. Using the saved coal to water the wheat one more time, the cost of each 100 jin of wheat this year was reduced from 7 yuan, 2 jiao and 1 fen last year to 4 yuan, 8 jiao and 5 fen.

    Each small team also pays attention to saving labor, comparing fine work and saving labor. A red flag quota competition and a double quota competition were launched between teams. With the development of the competition, commune members have taken the initiative to innovate tools. The wide-width wheat scriber created by the members of the tenth team can scribe ten mu of wheat a day. This team has 150 mu of wheat (watered three times and scribed three times). According to the past contracted work plan (each person scribes one mu of wheat per day), 450 workdays are required. Using the wide-width wheat scriber, only 45 workdays are required. Activities to save manpower, material resources and financial resources have made the commune members have a strong interest in their labor. In the past few years, batches of pacesetters have emerged in all walks of life. Among them are Wang Yunchang, a well-digging expert known as the "water conservancy expert," Jin Yonggang, an insect control pacesetter who masters the laws of various insect pests, and Shang Yongfei, a breeder who has raised pigs for five years without a single death..., in June of this year, 57 model commune members with high work efficiency emerged.

    Running Forward

    The appearance of Nanwangzhuang has undergone earth-shaking changes. In 1956, the yield of grain per mu was 181 jin, an increase of one-third compared with individual farming; in 1957, the yield of grain per mu was 259 jin; in 1958, the yield of grain per mu increased to 285 jin; in 1959, the yield of grain per mu reached 405 jin, achieving the agricultural development program eight years ahead of schedule; this year, the average yield per mu was 512 jin, and the yield crossed the Yellow River. Grain has been growing year by year, and the lives of commune members have gradually become prosperous. This year, the income of commune members has increased by two and a half times compared with the elementary cooperative period. More than 80% of the households in the village have savings, and the long-term savings of commune members have reached more than 21,000 yuan. The number of livestock in the production team has also increased year by year, and the number of sheep and pigs has increased year by year. Various sideline industries and forestry and fruit industries serving agriculture have shown a new atmosphere of prosperity. At present, in addition to ensuring that commune members are paid wages on a monthly basis, the winter sideline production of this production team will also provide 17,000 yuan of funds for agricultural production next year.

    Nanwangzhuang has entered a new milestone in winning a bumper harvest next year, and they are running forward in the movement to run agriculture and grain in a big way.

    持久打算  勤俭创业
    ——南王庄发扬“五亿农民的方向”的精神五年间生产节节上升
    毛主席誉为“五亿农民的方向”的三户贫农——河北深县南王庄王玉坤、王小其、王小庞，从1955年坚持走合作化道路到现在，五年时间过去了，他们在党的领导下，引导群众勤俭创业，已经使南王庄起了旋乾转坤的变化。
    五年前的南王庄，人们叫它“白沙滩”和“卧龙岗”。滹沱河在这里三次改道，留下了几条河沟和六十四个大沙岗。年年风沙为患，收成很低。老年人形容当年的沙滩是“南王庄，大沙滩，刮起风来不见天，年种数次苗不全，祖祖辈辈受熬煎”。如今的南王庄，荒沙地和丘岗地早已全部变成了水田，变成了连年丰收的宝地。从1957年，这里就改变了年年缺粮的面貌，1959年提前八年实现了“农业发展纲要”规定的指标。今年虽然遇到七十年来未有的大旱，麦秋两季的收成仍然超过了往年。
    要扭转乾坤
    “五亿农民的方向”闻名全国，1955年冬到这里来参观的人很多。社员们欢欣鼓舞，玉坤、小其、小庞却感到责任重大。南王庄这时每年还缺八万九千斤粮食啊。毛主席给了这么大荣誉，怎么改变这里的穷困面貌呢？为这事，他们研究过多少次，商量来商量去，无非是一个“干”字。
    第二年，王玉坤被聘请为全国政协委员，出席了中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第二次全体会议。会议期间，毛主席亲切地问玉坤：“你们那社有多少户？”玉坤回答：“三百二十五户。”毛主席说：“以后的家不好当了，当全村的家，比当三户贫农的家难得多啊。”毛主席的关怀，使王玉坤许久不能平静。“怎么当好这个家呢？”他想到了全村一百多户贫农过去怎样过日子，想到现在处处得很好的打算，……想来想去，觉着要当好家，要改变穷困面貌，非得一切作长久打算不可。
    玉坤兴奋地回到了南王庄。没有进家，就把小其、小庞叫在一起，传达了毛主席的话。小其、小庞建议召开支委会，大伙商量怎么把家当好。第二天，旧历腊月30日，支委会开会，分析了全村的经济状况和人们的要求，认为应当订个奋斗目标，一步一步朝前走。在玉坤建议下，支委会订出了四年实现“农业发展纲要”的规划。
    这一年，全村社员劳动热情很高，出工量比那一年都大。玉米耕二耙三锄四遍，棉花锄了七遍。各种庄稼一天一个样，真叫人喜欢。可是，正当玉米灌浆、棉花结蕾，眼看丰收在望的时候，滹沱河的洪水卷着泥沙袭来了。玉米淹了，棉花泡了。南王庄遭到了百年不遇的水灾。
    洪水淹没了好庄稼，有些人减低了实现规划的信心。王玉坤、王小其、王小庞可没有动摇，他们坚信能够度过灾荒。王玉坤把小其、小庞召集在一起说：“咱们一定不能松劲，要是咱们退一尺，别人就会退一丈。咱们挺起腰板，坚定地干，群众就会跟上来。有党、有群众，就没有过不去的火焰山。”小其说：“咱祖祖辈辈闯过了多少灾难呵。眼下，不过就是这么一场水呗。”
    在讨论生产度荒的群众会上，王玉坤提出了生产度荒的办法。他说：“灾荒年要为今后的丰收年着想；丰收年要提防减产受灾。今年虽然受了灾，只要副业搞得好，可以度过灾荒，还要给明年丰收打好底子。”社员都觉得玉坤的意见对，又提出了很多副业生产项目。他们没向国家贷款，就组织了十八种副业生产。党支部划分了经营范围，订立了分红方案，把全队社员组织到各种副业生产中去，大干了一冬一春，度过了灾荒，还清了社员的投资账，还余下八千多元。
    生产度荒的胜利，是南王庄创业史上的良好开端。1956年冬，社员们用副业生产收入的钱，买了两台柴油机和两个水泵；用木工厂的收入买了四万多斤化肥、二十八只羊和十四头猪。
    自力更生　持久打算
    要真正使南王庄扭转乾坤，在勤俭办社中必须有持久打算。
    要把持久打算的思想变为广大社员群众的行动，就必须用群众自己教育自己的方法来解决。1957年，要办两件大事：一是治住风沙（造防风林），一是治住干旱（打井、平整土地）。一开春，社员们就投入了造林、打井、削岗、填沟、平整土地的劳动。样样任务很紧张，社员们拉车运土、背筐、推车捣土，有些人怵头了。这时，角丘供销社的干部来找王玉坤，说：“供销社运来了胶轮大车，如果要，可以赊给。”玉坤从各方面想了想，不能要，就谢绝了。有些社员对玉坤不愿赊车很有意见。王玉坤给社员们提出这样一个问题：“咱们要改变穷困面貌，是靠自力更生呢，还是靠赊账起家？”他还说：“有人笑话咱们穷，这有什么？咱们埋头苦干，干它三、五年，就可以富起来，如果只顾眼前壮门面，沙地改造不了，地里打不多粮食，别人会给咱们更大的讽刺。”说到这里，有些人思想通了，人们议论起来：“毛主席表扬我们，是因为咱们走社会主义道路有志气，马上就买骡子买马，这样做不对！”一切作长期打算勤俭创业的人，说了很多激动人心的话，讨论会很自然地变成了搞好当前生产的献计会。
    坚持勤俭创业原则
    在持久打算勤俭创业的过程中，也是有斗争的。
    事情发生在计划提前实现“农业发展纲要”的准备工作上。南王庄积累了九千多元。怎样用这九千多元，原来的支部书记王米贵和副书记王玉坤发生了分歧。王米贵主张抽七千多元盖招待所、办公室，购置一套办公桌和档案橱子。留下两千元支持生产。他的理由是：“现在已经不是1956年的南王庄了，各种设置应该像个样子。要不，让外来的人看见，显得不体面。”王玉坤和王米贵的想法不同，玉坤说：“参观的人，不是看房子，是看咱们的庄稼，房子让人家住得再好，地里打的粮食不多，那才真不体面。”他主张把这九千元全部用在生产上。玉坤的主张代表了一部分干部的意见，王米贵的主张也代表了一部分干部的意见。最后支部委员会决定叫群众讨论一下，按群众的意见办事。
    社员代表会开会了。每个小队都派了两三名代表，还有十个小队的小队长。代表们发言很热烈，有的从分析生产形势入手，有的从勤俭创业谈起，有提建议的，也有提批评的。代表说：“打井盖房，三年余粮，我们的生活水平虽说提高了，可还没有两年的余粮，要是现在就大兴土木，结果是盖了房，减了粮，下一步被动。”有的代表说：“五年规划刚迈了第一步，第二步还没有抬脚，人们过日子的心气正高，干部们万万不能动摇；应该把盖房子的钱用在打机井上，加快实现农业发展纲要的奋斗目标。”
    代表们的意见教育了干部，两种思想统一为一种思想——为下一步着想，为发展生产着想。提前实现农业发展纲要的关键是什么呢？——水。应该多打机井。当时算了一笔账，九千多元可以打三眼机井。有了这三眼井，两年就可以实现纲要的要求。
    有了水，两年连获丰收。1958年全村平均亩产粮食二百八十五斤。1959年粮食平均亩产四百零五斤，提前八年超过了“农业发展纲要”规定的指标。
    最大限度节省开支
    在南王庄，社员们人人争勤，户户比俭，开支一文钱、用掉一点物都考虑了再考虑。这一勤俭风气的形成，除了因为持久打算勤俭创业的思想深入人心以外，还有两码事，使人们很受感动。
    一码事，是广东军区的一个叫周瑞星的解放军中尉，从1955年在报纸上看到“五亿农民的方向”这篇文章起，每月寄来五元钱，支持南王庄的生产建设。每当人们想到这位中尉时，不由地就省了又省，俭了又俭。
    另一码事，是玉坤的节约品德。玉坤是劳动模范，生产大队长，党支部副书记，还是南王庄公社的副主任，外出活动很多，可是他出差路费、开会期间的开支，总是出奇的少。去年冬天，他在天津、北京开了两个月的会，回来时，从束鹿下了车，步行七十里回到家，马上去财务股报账。
    “国生，算账。”
    “有什么算的？你出门又没拿队里一元钱。”
    “有账可算。去时的路费公家报销了，这是一笔；在会议期间，公家发的生活费省着没花，攒下了六十八元多，两笔合计总共七十五元。”玉坤一边说，一边向会计递款。
    国生又感动又为难地说：“这笔款可收到那个科目里呢？”
    “甭管科目不科目，收下吧。”
    从1957年到现在，玉坤交回队里的盘费和生活费，已有三百四十多元。
    队干部张树青原是比较爱吃、爱花钱的人。可是他每想多花社里一文钱的时候，就会想起周瑞星热情的支援，王玉坤廉洁奉公的事。因而也变得节俭了。秋前省里召开卫生工作流动现场会，他去了二十多天，一天应该开支四角钱，他回来算账，每天开支只合三角一分钱。社员王菜包、张树其到磨头去拉煤，应该花二元四角钱的路费，也只花一元二角。像这样的事还有很多。从1956年到现在，只是队里的办公费省下来的钱，就买了四台煤气机。人们称这是“节约”号机器。
    生产队的财务管理工作，除了最大限度地节省开支以外，还创造了一套生产成本管理和财务包干相结合的经济核算制度。这一制度规定：每一项农作物所用的种子、化肥、燃料（机器用煤、耗油）、消费、机具修配、小农具购置费和生产上使用的人工、畜力、饲料等等，都有定额。把这些定额包干到小队，调动了小队社员降低生产成本的积极性。每台锅驼机耗煤定额规定日烧煤一千斤，浇地三十亩。锅驼机手王运昌觉得耗煤多，和玉坤边烧边改进，总结出一套“高铲扬煤”的节约方法，煤耗由日烧一千斤降到七百斤。推广了这一经验，只是麦收以前的几次浇水，全队就节约了七万二千多斤煤。用节约的煤对小麦多浇了一次水，使今年每百斤小麦的成本由去年的七元二角一分，降低到四元八角五分。
    各小队还都很注意劳力的节省，比做活细，比省工。在队和队之间，展开了红旗定额竞赛和双定额竞赛。随着竞赛的开展，社员都主动革新工具。十小队社员创造的宽幅划麦器，一天能划麦十亩。这个队一百五十亩小麦（浇了三水、划了三次），按过去包工计划（每人每天划麦一亩）需要四百五十个劳动日，用宽幅划麦器，只用四十五个劳动日。节约人力物力财力的活动，使社员们对自己的劳动产生了浓厚的兴趣。几年来，各行各业出现了一批又一批的标兵。其中有打机井能手号称“水利通”的王运昌，有掌握各种虫害规律的除虫标兵靳永刚，有养猪五年不死一头的饲养员商永肥……，今年6月，又涌现出五十七个高工效的模范社员。
    跑步前进
    南王庄的面貌发生了翻天复地的变化。1956年亩产粮食一百八十一斤，比单干时增长了三分之一；1957年粮食亩产二百五十九斤；1958年粮食亩产增到二百八十五斤；1959年粮食亩产达四百零五斤，提前八年实现了农业发展纲要；今年每亩平均亩产五百一十二斤，产量跨过了黄河。粮食逐年增长，社员生活逐步富裕起来。今年社员的收入比初级社时增加了两倍半，全村80％以上的户都有存款，社员长期存款达二万一千多元。生产队的牲口也一年比一年多，羊群猪只一年比一年多，为农业服务的各种副业和林果业，都呈现一种蒸蒸日上的新气象。目前，这个生产队冬季副业生产除保证按月给社员发工资，还要为明年农业生产提供一万七千元的资金。
    南王庄已经进入夺取明年大丰收的新里程，他们正在大办农业、大办粮食运动中跑步前进。
