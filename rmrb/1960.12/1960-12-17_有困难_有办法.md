    Difficulties Exist, But There Are Solutions
    Emei
    This year, many regions have suffered the most severe natural disasters in decades, bringing us many difficulties.
    However, how should we deal with these difficulties? Should we establish lofty ambitions and try every possible means to overcome difficulties; or should we be timid and helpless? This is a very important question, and it is the key to whether we can overcome difficulties. In this regard, the Lujia Yuan Production Team has set a brilliant example for us. Let us read the inspiring news "Lujia Yuan Production Team Turns Severe Disaster into a Minor One." The cadres and members of this production team did not shrink back in the face of severe difficulties, nor did they bow their heads to difficulties. Instead, they bravely shouldered the "burden" of difficulties. In just over three months of disaster relief efforts, they turned a severe disaster into a minor one, the lives of the commune members were settled, and winter production became increasingly active... Here, we truly see the power of the revolutionary people's optimism!
    Those who dare to fight against difficulties always have the most solutions.
    Under the guidance of the Party's policy of production for disaster relief and thrift for weathering the famine, the Lujia Yuan Production Team proceeded from reality, clarified the disaster situation, and had a clear understanding in their minds. They were good at relying on the masses, "revealing" all their assets after the disaster, and mobilizing everyone to discuss; their work was thorough and meticulous, strictly implementing the Party's policies, caring for people, and being considerate, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the commune members.
    Having mastered the Party's policies and having the masses as their backing, as the masses said, "There is no Flaming Mountain that cannot be crossed." And look, the "Flaming Mountain" has really been trampled under their feet: they planted the crops that could be planted in a timely manner, harvested all the useful things from the fields, and developed sideline production in many ways to increase cash income, not only ensuring the current food and clothing of the commune members, but also, in the spirit of planned use of grain and saving grain, properly arranged the rations from the beginning of September to June of next year in stages. In the face of a severe disaster in which two-thirds of the crops were flooded, is it not a miracle to achieve such a victory?
  Daring to struggle—strategically despising difficulties; being realistic and solving specific problems one by one—tactically valuing difficulties, this is the invincible strategic and tactical thought of Chairman Mao. The Lujia Yuan Production Team used this great thought, and difficulties were no longer obstacles to their progress, but became the driving force for people to move forward more courageously, and achieved a preliminary but huge victory in production and disaster relief.

    有困难　有办法
    娥眉
    今年不少地区遭受了几十年来最严重的自然灾害，给我们带来了不少困难。
    但是，怎样对待这些困难呢？是树立雄心壮志，千方百计战胜困难；还是畏首畏尾，束手无策呢？这是一个很重要的问题，是能否战胜困难的关键。在这方面陆家院生产队给我们树立了光辉的榜样。让我们读一读“陆家院生产队重灾变轻灾”这条令人振奋的新闻吧。这个生产队的干部和群众在严重的困难面前，没有退缩，没有向困难低头，而是勇敢地担起了困难的“重担”，仅只三个多月的抗灾斗争，就把重灾变成轻灾，社员生活有了着落，冬季生产日益活跃……。在这里，我们真正看到了革命人民的乐观主义精神的威力！
    敢于向困难作斗争的人，总是最有办法的。
    陆家院生产队在党的生产救灾、节约度荒的方针指导下，从实际出发，摸清灾情，做到胸中有数；他们善于依靠群众，把受灾以后的全部家底“亮”出去，发动大家来讨论；他们工作深入细致，严格执行党的政策，关心人，体贴人，充分调动了社员的积极性。
    掌握了党的政策，有了群众作靠山，就像群众说的那样“哪有过不去的火焰山”。且看“火焰山”真的被他们踏在脚下了：他们把能种的作物及时种下去，把有用的东西从田野里全部采收回来，又从多方面开展副业生产增加现金收入，不仅保证了社员当前的吃、穿，而且本着计划用粮、节约用粮的精神，从9月初到明年6月的口粮也分段安排妥当。在三分之二农作物被淹的严重灾情下，能取得这样的胜利，难道不是奇迹吗？
  敢于斗争——在战略上蔑视困难；实事求是，一个个解决具体问题——在战术上重视困难，这是战无不胜的毛主席的战略战术思想。陆家院生产队运用了这一伟大思想，困难便不再是障碍他们前进的暗礁，而是成了人们更加奋勇前进的动力，取得了生产救灾的初步但却是巨大的胜利。
