Xinhua News Agency, December 15th—Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai and his wife hosted an informal dinner tonight to welcome Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Head of State of Cambodia, his wife, and all the Cambodian dignitaries accompanying Prince Sihanouk on his visit.

Penn Nouth, Vice Chairman of the High Council of the Throne of Cambodia, Prime Minister Pho Proeung, First Deputy Prime Minister Nhiek Tioulong, Prince Sihanouk's princesses and princes, some senior Cambodian officials, Cambodian Ambassador to China Leng Ngeth, all members of the embassy, and their wives were invited to attend the dinner tonight. The Cambodian Economic Delegation and some artists from the Royal Ballet Troupe were also invited to attend the dinner.

Premier Zhou spoke at the banquet. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, he extended a warm welcome to Prince Sihanouk and his wife, Vice Chairman Penn Nouth, Prime Minister Pho Proeung, First Deputy Prime Minister Nhiek Tioulong, and other Cambodian dignitaries.

Premier Zhou said that since we met Prince Sihanouk at the Bandung Conference in 1955, the friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian people and the relations between China and Cambodia have achieved encouraging development. Our two countries' leaders have made frequent mutual visits, and our two countries' economic cooperation and cultural exchanges have greatly developed. In particular, in the struggle against colonialist aggression, to defend our respective national sovereignty and national independence, and to safeguard Asian and world peace, our two countries have supported each other and cooperated in a friendly manner.

Premier Zhou emphasized that the friendly relations between China and Cambodia have developed smoothly based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference. He said that this is primarily due to Prince Sihanouk's efforts for the friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian people and for Asian peace.

Premier Zhou praised the Cambodian people as warm and courageous people, and Cambodia as an independent and self-respecting country. He said that the Chinese government has always respected and supported the Kingdom of Cambodia government's policy of peace, neutrality, and independent autonomy under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk. He emphasized that Cambodia, after gaining independence, has made increasingly greater contributions and exerted a greater influence in international affairs.

Premier Zhou expressed his gratitude to Prince Sihanouk for once again justly supporting China's legitimate rights and interests in international affairs at the Fifteenth United Nations General Assembly.

When Premier Zhou mentioned that Prince Sihanouk had sent his beloved princes to China to study in July this year, he pointed out that this is a development of the friendly relations and mutual trust between China and Cambodia. He emphasized that Prince Sihanouk has not only made himself a link of friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian people, but also made his princes, who have come to China to study, a link of friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian people. He warmly wished that through the efforts of the Chinese and Cambodian people, the friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian people will develop for generations to come.

Premier Zhou concluded by saying that Prince Sihanouk's previous two visits to China have strengthened the friendly relations between China and Cambodia, and that this visit by Prince Sihanouk and other Cambodian dignitaries will surely further strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian people and be conducive to peace in Asia, especially in the Southeast Asian region.

Prince Sihanouk spoke. He expressed his deep gratitude for the grand and moving welcome given by our country's leaders and the people of the capital.

Prince Sihanouk praised Premier Zhou Enlai as the great creator of frank and sincere cooperation between China and Cambodia. He said that no foreign politician enjoys such great prestige in our country; he is our faithful, sincere, and selfless friend. He deeply understands our situation and our problems, and has always given us support and assistance when our country's survival was in danger and in the most difficult times. He said that Vice Premier Marshal Chen Yi is also a very faithful friend of our country.

Prince Sihanouk said: "It is extremely rare for a country as powerful as New China to adopt the great and noble principles of equality between countries and between nations so naturally in its relations with smaller countries. Therefore, our friendship with China is based on absolute trust. It is also because of this that the scope of New China's friends on all continents of the world is expanding every year. It is also precisely because of this that any country and people in the world who are subjected to unjust threats will surely look to China for brotherly and effective support, will surely gain the greatest confidence in their future from this support, and will surely applaud every new achievement made by the Chinese people."

He said: "We are convinced that any conspiracy to isolate China in the world will only isolate those who create such conspiracies. Because, from now on, no force can stop the Chinese people from striving to build a peaceful and prosperous future."

Prince Sihanouk said that the friendship between Cambodia and China is unwavering, and that the development of this friendship and our cooperation are the main principles of our policy. In a few days, we will sign a treaty of friendship and non-aggression. He praised China's friendship with Cambodia and China's absolute respect for the Bandung Principles. He said: "We believe that the friendship with a positive China and the Chinese people is an extremely precious guarantee for safeguarding our country's independence and freedom."

The speeches by Premier Zhou Enlai and Prince Sihanouk were warmly applauded.

At the banquet, the hosts and guests gathered together happily and spoke freely about friendship. Everyone enthusiastically raised their glasses to wish the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian people continued development.

Attending tonight's banquet were: Vice Premiers of the State Council Chen Yi, Ulanhu, Li Xiannian, Luo Ruiqing, and Xi Zhongxun; Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, Saifudin, Panchen Erdeni Chojekyi Gyaltsen, and Lin Feng; Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Burhan; Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong; Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu and Ji Pengfei; Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Wang Youping; President of the Sino-Cambodian Friendship Association Qi Yanming; President of the Buddhist Association of China Shirob Jaltso; and heads of various government departments, senior generals of the People's Liberation Army, and responsible persons of Beijing.

    周总理在宴会上讲话。他代表中国政府和中国人民向西哈努克亲王和他的夫人，向宾努副主席、福·波伦首相、?·刁隆第一副首相，和其他柬埔寨贵宾们表示热烈欢迎。
    周总理说，自从1955年我们在万隆会议认识西哈努克亲王以来，中柬两国人民的友谊，中柬两国的关系得到了令人鼓舞的发展。我们两国领导人进行了频繁的相互访问，我们两国的经济合作和文化交流有了很大发展。特别是在反对殖民主义侵略、捍卫各自的国家主权和民族独立、维护亚洲和世界和平的斗争中，我们两国是互相支持和友好合作的。
    周总理着重指出，中柬两国友好关系，是根据和平共处五项原则和万隆会议十项原则得到顺利发展的。他说，这首先要归功于西哈努克亲王为中柬两国人民的友好和为亚洲和平所作的努力。

    西哈努克亲王说：“一个像新中国那样强大的国家在它同较小的国家的关系中非常自然地采取国与国之间、民族与民族之间伟大和崇高的平等原则，这实在是极为罕见的。因此，我们对中国的友谊是建立在绝对信任的基础之上的。也因此，新中国在世界各大洲的朋友的范围每年都在扩大。也正由于如此，世界上任何一个遭受不公正的威胁的国家和人民一定会指望中国兄弟般的有效的支持，一定会从这种支持中获得对自己前途的最大的信心，也一定会欢呼中国人民所取得的每一个新的成就。”
    他说：“我们确信，一切企图在世界上孤立中国的阴谋，只会使制造这种阴谋的人自己受到孤立。因为，从今以后，没有任何力量能够阻挡中国人民为建设一个和平与昌盛的未来而努力。”
