　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 5th: According to a broadcast today from the Lao Fighting Units radio station, the Kingdom’s troops in areas controlled by the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group in Laos have recently expressed their loyalty to the Phouma government. Officers and soldiers in many places have written letters supporting the Phouma government's policy of peace and neutrality and national harmony, and are cooperating with the armed forces of the Lao Fighting Units in various places to oppose the Phoumi-Boun Oum rebel group.

　　During October and November, the Kingdom's troops in Muong Hiem District, Muong Ngai District, and Bi Village in Luang Prabang Province, as well as in some other areas controlled by the Phoumi rebel group, have cooperated with the Lao Fighting Units to oppose the Phoumi-Boun Oum rebel group. Many Kingdom's army units in Khammouane Province and southern Laos, which are controlled by the Phoumi rebel group, have also established contact with the Lao Fighting Units and are cooperating with each other. Many Kingdom's army units in central and southern Laos have expressed their support for the Phouma government's policies and their opposition to the reactionary actions of the Phoumi-Boun Oum group.

　　In Phongsaly Province, hundreds of members of assault teams have cooperated with the people's armed forces to oppose the "mopping-up" activities of the traitorous group's henchman, Captain Heng, and others.

　　The Lao Fighting Units radio station pointed out that the above situation shows that the Phouma government is deeply supported by the broad masses of the Lao people and the Kingdom's army. Conversely, although the Phoumi-Boun Oum rebel group uses money to tempt, deceive, and buy off the people and troops to oppose the Phouma government, they are still hated by the people, and many soldiers are unwilling to carry out their orders.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi: According to a broadcast from the Lao Fighting Units radio station: Soldiers who deserted from the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak traitorous group revealed that the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group is corrupt and embezzled military pay, arousing the dissatisfaction of the soldiers. Since October, the army has not received wages, while the heads of this group have deposited US "aid" dollars in banks and profited from them.

　　The radio station said that on October 6, some soldiers distributed leaflets in Boun Oum's hometown of Pakse, denouncing their above-mentioned actions and demanding the prompt payment of back wages. Many soldiers have already deserted.

    老挝叛乱集团控制地区许多军队
    纷纷表示忠于富马政府
    同寮国战斗部队合作打击叛乱集团
    新华社河内5日电　据寮国战斗部队电台今天广播，老挝富米·诺萨万叛乱集团控制地区的王国军队最近纷纷表示忠于富马政府。许多地方的官兵写信支持富马政府奉行的和平中立和民族和睦政策，并同各地的寮国战斗部队武装力量合作，反对富米—文翁叛乱集团。
    在10月和11月期间，琅勃拉邦省的芒合县、芒艾县和碧村以及富米叛乱集团控制的其他一些地区的王国军队已经同寮国战斗部队合作，反对富米—文翁叛乱集团。富米叛乱集团控制的甘蒙省和老挝南部许多王国军队单位也已经同寮国战斗部队取得联系，互相合作。老挝中部和南部的许多王国军队单位纷纷表示赞成富马政府的政策，反对富米—文翁集团的反动行为。
    在丰沙里省，突击队的成百名队员已经同人民的武装力量合作，反对叛国集团的爪牙恒上尉等的“扫荡”活动。
    寮国战斗部队电台指出，上述情况说明，富马政府深受老挝广大人民和王国军队的热烈支持，相反，尽管富米—文翁叛乱集团以金钱诱惑、欺骗、收买人民和部队来反对富马政府，但是，他们仍然遭到人民的憎恨，而许多士兵也不肯执行他们的命令。
    据新华社河内电　据寮国战斗部队电台广播：据脱离富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞叛国集团的士兵揭露，富米·诺萨万叛国集团贪污腐败，克扣军饷引起士兵的不满。从10月份以来，军队领不到工资，而这个集团的头目们却把美国“援助”的美元存到银行里，从中渔利。
    电台说，10月6日一些士兵在文翁的家乡巴色市散发传单，痛骂它们的上述行动，并且要求迅速发放拖欠的军饷。已经有许多士兵开了小差。
