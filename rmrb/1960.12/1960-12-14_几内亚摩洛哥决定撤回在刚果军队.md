Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, December 13th: The Guinean government held an expanded meeting on the 11th, attended by members of the National Assembly and members of the Political Bureau of the Democratic Party of Guinea, and decided to immediately withdraw Guinean troops from the UN forces in the Congo.

The Guinean government sent a telegram to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld after the meeting, notifying him of the above decision. The telegram stated that the Guinean government took this decision because the United Nations was an accomplice in the kidnapping of Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba and the disabling of the legitimate Congolese government.

The Guinean government also sent telegrams to countries that, like Guinea, had decided to withdraw their troops from the UN forces in the Congo. The telegram stated that the Guinean government welcomed their decision, which aimed to guarantee the independence of the Congolese people and expose the reactionary activities of the United Nations authorities in the Congo. The Guinean government requested in the telegram that a summit of African heads of state be convened to discuss the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Congolese people.

Xinhua News Agency, Rabat, December 12th: Moroccan Minister of Information, Al-Alawi, announced on the evening of the 12th that the Moroccan government had decided to withdraw its troops from the Congo.

This decision was communicated to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 12th by Moroccan Acting Foreign Minister, Abdul Karim Benjelloun. In a telegram to Hammarskjöld, Benjelloun stated, "Morocco made a large number of its national troops available to the United Nations, originally to participate in ensuring peace and respecting the legitimate government of the Congo. Unfortunately, the attitude now adopted by the United Nations forces does not conform to this objective. Therefore, the Moroccan government has decided to withdraw its troops stationed in the Congo and let the United Nations bear responsibility for the consequences arising from this situation."

The telegram pointed out that the arbitrary arrest of Congolese government leader Lumumba has caused a tragedy in the Congo. Lumumba's life is now in serious danger.

    几内亚摩洛哥决定撤回在刚果军队
    新华社科纳克里13日电　几内亚政府11日举行了由国民议会议员和几内亚民主党政治局委员参加的扩大会议，决定立即撤回几内亚在刚果“联合国军”中的部队。
    几内亚政府在会后打电报给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，把上述决定通知了他。电报中说，几内亚政府采取这一决定是由于联合国是绑架刚果总理卢蒙巴和使刚果合法政府无法工作的同谋者。
    几内亚政府同时还打电报给那些同几内亚一样决定撤回他们在刚果“联合国军”中的部队的国家。电报说，几内亚政府欢迎它们所采取的目的在于保证刚果人民独立和揭露联合国当局在刚果的反动活动的决定。几内亚政府在电报中要求召开一次非洲国家首脑会议，来讨论恢复刚果人民的合法权利的问题。
    新华社拉巴特12日电　摩洛哥新闻大臣阿劳维在12日晚间宣布，摩洛哥政府已经决定把它在刚果的军队撤回。
    这项决定是12日由摩洛哥代理外交大臣阿卜杜勒·克里姆·本杰隆通知联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的。本杰隆在致哈马舍尔德的电报中说，“摩洛哥把自己国家的大批部队提供给联合国支配，本来是为了参与保障和平和尊重刚果的合法政府，可是联合国部队现在所采取的态度不幸地不符合这个目标。因此，摩洛哥政府决定把自己派驻在刚果的部队撤走，并且让联合国去承担这种局势所产生的后果的责任。”
    电报指出，专横地逮捕刚果政府首脑卢蒙巴的事件造成了刚果的悲剧。卢蒙巴的生命现在正处于严重的危险之中。
