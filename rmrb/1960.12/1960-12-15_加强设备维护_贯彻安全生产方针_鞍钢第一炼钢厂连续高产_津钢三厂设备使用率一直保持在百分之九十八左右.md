Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, December 14th: The First Steel Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel, in the midst of a surge for high production in December, earnestly implements the policy of safe production, ensuring a continuous rise in output. In the first ten days of December, the plant's average daily steel production increased by 8.4% compared to November.

After the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a call to go all out in December to fulfill and overfulfill the annual steel production plan, the First Steel Plant's Party Committee immediately seized upon the decisive link of safe production, vigorously strengthening equipment maintenance to ensure sustained leaps forward. The plant, led by Deputy Director Chen Xiaofa and Assistant Director Liu Kexiang, formed a furnace body inspection group and an equipment inspection group, respectively, specifically responsible for the plant's safety work. Chen Xiaofa, who had accumulated rich experience in furnace maintenance, personally led the furnace body inspection group members to classify all open-hearth furnaces in the plant according to furnace age and condition, inspecting general furnaces every two days and key furnaces every day. When problems were discovered during the inspections, they promptly informed the furnace operators, organized forces to deal with them, and explained the handling methods in detail. The roof of No. 4 open-hearth furnace had originally turned red. After Chen Xiaofa discovered it, he immediately helped the furnace workers install a blowing device on the roof to strengthen blowing, so that the roof quickly returned to normal. Chen Xiaofa specially made a demonstration of furnace operation at the No. 2 open-hearth furnace, shortening the furnace operation time from the past eight or nine hours to more than six hours, with excellent quality. After the head furnace operators of each furnace carefully studied his operation methods, they created a new record of smelting a furnace in four hours and thirty-five minutes, with fully qualified quality. Thanks to the plant's emphasis on the maintenance of furnace bodies and equipment, the equipment operating rate has always remained above 90%, laying a solid foundation for achieving high production.

On the basis of maintaining furnace bodies and emphasizing safe production, the work teams and open-hearth furnace workers of the First Steel Plant further launched a communist collaboration pact competition. As a result of the communist collaboration pact competition among the plant's four major work teams, the smelting time for each furnace of steel was shortened day by day, and a new situation of continuous high production emerged in every shift and every day.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 14th: Tianjin No. 3 Steel Plant does a good job in equipment maintenance, and the equipment utilization rate has been maintained at around 98%, creating favorable conditions for continuous increases in steel production and winning a complete victory for the whole year. Following an 8% increase in the average daily steel production level in November compared to October, the average daily production level in the first ten days of December increased by 9.75% compared to the last ten days of November.

The leaders of this plant attach great importance to the maintenance and repair of various equipment, and often combine large-scale equipment inspections with ideological education among employees to cherish and maintain equipment; at the same time, they rhythmically organize high production and equipment maintenance work, regarding equipment maintenance work as an important part of the entire high-production campaign. They stipulate that every 3rd, 6th, and 9th of the month are high-production days for steel, the 1st, 4th, and 7th are consolidation and summary days, and the 2nd, 5th, and 8th are equipment maintenance days. Every "2nd, 5th, and 8th," the motor vehicle workshop and the smelting workshop jointly propose maintenance tasks, and the plant-level dispatch meeting uniformly arranges the maintenance plan, and organizes workers from the plant's five types of work: vehicle, fitter, electrical, welding, and forging, concentrating efforts on maintenance.

During maintenance, a style of great collaboration is promoted between various types of work and between three shifts, with responses coming from all directions when one place is in need. The employees of the tool room take the initiative to make lightweight toolboxes for fitters to carry with them, and prepare various tools. Machinists systematically produce spare parts according to the wear and tear of various parts. The entire plant has recently rushed to produce and store more than 1,300 types of spare parts, and various main components maintain a certain reserve quota to ensure that equipment failures can be quickly repaired.

    加强设备维护　贯彻安全生产方针
    鞍钢第一炼钢厂连续高产
    津钢三厂设备使用率一直保持在百分之九十八左右
    据新华社鞍山14日电　鞍钢第一炼钢厂在大干12月的生产新高潮中，认真贯彻安全生产方针，保证了生产连续上升。12月上旬全厂钢的平均日产量，比11月份增长8.4％。
    中共鞍山市委发出大干12月、完成和超额完成全年钢产量计划的号召后，第一炼钢厂党委立即抓住了安全生产这个决定性环节，大力加强设备维护工作，保证持续跃进。厂内以副厂长陈效法和厂长助理刘克祥为首，分别组成炉体检查组和设备检查组，专门负责全厂安全工作。在护炉方面积累了丰富经验的陈效法，亲自率领炉体检查组成员，按照炉龄长短和炉体好坏情况，把全厂所有平炉分了类，一般炉子每两天检查一次，重点炉子天天检查。检查中发现了问题，他们就及时告诉炉上，组织力量进行处理，并且详细交代处理办法。四号平炉原来炉顶已经发红，陈效法检查发现后，立即帮助炉上工人在炉顶上安了一个吹风设备，加强吹扫，使炉顶很快恢复正常。陈效法特地在二号平炉作了一次炼炉示范表演，把炼炉时间从过去的八、九个小时缩短到六小时多，质量很好。各炉总炉长们认真学习他的操作方法后，又创造出四小时三十五分钟炼一炉的新纪录，质量完全合格。全厂由于重视了炉体、设备的维护，设备作业率始终保持在90％以上，为夺取高产打下了稳固的基础。
    第一炼钢厂各班组和平炉职工，在维护好炉体和重视安全生产的基础上，进一步开展了共产主义协作公约竞赛。全厂四大班共产主义协作公约竞赛开展的结果，使每炉钢的熔炼时间一天比一天缩短，生产出现了班班、天天持续高产的新局面。
    新华社天津14日电　天津第三钢厂设备维修工作做得好，设备使用率一直保持在98％左右，为钢产量持续上升，夺取全年满堂红创造了有利条件。全厂继11月份钢的平均日产水平比10月份增长8％以后，12月上旬的平均日产水平又比11月下旬增长了9.75％。
    这个厂的领导上十分重视各种设备的维护和检修工作，经常结合设备大检查，在职工中开展爱护设备和维护好设备的思想教育；同时，有节奏地组织高产和设备维修工作，把设备维修工作作为整个高产战役的重要部分。他们规定每逢3、6、9日为钢的高产日，1、4、7日为巩固、总结日，2、5、8日为设备检修日。每逢“2、5、8”日，由电机车间和冶炼车间共同提出检修任务，由厂级调度会议统一安排检修计划，并且把全厂的车、钳、电、焊、锻五个工种的工人组织起来，集中力量检修。
    在检修中，各工种之间、三班之间大兴协作之风，一处需要，八方呼应。工具室的职工主动为钳工做好随身携带的轻便工具箱，准备好各种工具。车工们根据各种备件的磨损情况，有计划地生产备件。全厂最近已经赶制并储存了一千三百多种备件，各种主要部件都保持有一定的储备定额，保证在发生设备事故时，能迅速修好。
