    Qingdao Vigorously Conserves Grain for Yarn Sizing
    Saving Over 27,000 Kilograms of Starch in November
    (Reported by our newspaper) Qingdao's textile industry has achieved remarkable results in substituting for and conserving grain used in yarn sizing. According to statistics from the state-owned cotton mills and the Huaxin Textile Dyeing Factory, over 27,000 kilograms of starch were saved in November compared to October.
    Yarn sizing is a process in the textile industry's weaving process. The raw materials for yarn sizing in this city's textile industry have all been starch, with a monthly requirement of over 200,000 kilograms. Since the launch of the increased production and conservation movement centered on grain and steel, all textile factories have mobilized their workers to carry out a movement to conserve grain for industrial use, based on the principle of "reduce if possible, substitute if possible, and eliminate if possible."
    In the movement to conserve and substitute grain for yarn sizing, each factory has achieved immediate results by starting with gradually reducing the grain-based sizing rate and actively finding substitutes. Under the leadership of the deputy director in charge of technology, State-owned Cotton Mill No. 6 established a "three-way combination" professional research group. After repeated experiments and research, they finally successfully tested the use of partial talc powder to replace starch in the sizing material, reducing the sizing rate from the original 16% to 8%. State-owned Cotton Mill No. 7 adopted the same method, reducing the sizing rate from 19% to 7.9%. State-owned Cotton Mills No. 1, 4, and 8 and other units have also achieved considerable success in using white clay sizing to replace part of the talc powder. State-owned Cotton Mill No. 5 has also achieved the unsized weaving of poplin. These methods have greatly saved grain for industrial use.

    青岛大力节约浆纱用粮
    11月份节约淀粉二万七千多公斤
    本报讯　青岛市纺织业大搞浆纱用粮的代用和节约，取得显著成绩。据国棉各厂和华新纺织染厂的统计，11月份比10月份节约淀粉二万七千多公斤。
    浆纱是纺织业织造过程中的一道工序，这个市纺织业浆纱的原料都是使用淀粉，每月需要量达二十万公斤以上。开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动以来，各纺织厂都根据“能减就减、能代就代、能不用就不用”的原则，发动职工开展了节约工业用粮运动。
    在节约和代用浆纱用粮的运动中，各厂都从逐步降低用粮浆纱率和积极找代用品入手，取得了立竿见影的效果。国棉六厂在技术副厂长主持下，成立了“三结合”的专业研究小组，经过反复试验研究，最后试验成功了在浆料中用部分滑石粉代替淀粉上浆，上浆率由原来16％下降到8％。国棉七厂采用同样的办法，上浆率由19％下降到7.9％。国棉一厂、四厂、八厂等单位用白粘土上浆代替部分滑石粉，也都取得相当的成绩。国棉五厂还实现了府绸不上浆织布。这些办法，都大大节约了工业用粮。
