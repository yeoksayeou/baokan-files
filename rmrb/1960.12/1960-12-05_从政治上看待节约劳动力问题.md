Regarding the current efforts to conserve labor from all aspects and strengthen the front line of agricultural production, it is of extreme importance for realizing the continuous leap forward of national economic construction. Precisely because of this, the issue of conserving labor is not only a major economic task facing the entire Party and all the people, but also a major political task.

Labor creates everything, and labor power is the decisive factor of productivity. Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "Of all things in the world, people are the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle can be created." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol. IV, p. 1516). This is the viewpoint of historical materialism. In the relationship between people and things, people are fundamental. With human activity, there are objects in production; without human activity, even if natural resources are abundant, they cannot benefit mankind. Therefore, the rational and economical use of labor power is of utmost importance to the development of social production. We must first value the role of people, seeing both the material and the human, and striving to develop the enthusiasm and initiative of the laborers. Units such as Wuhan Iron and Steel Company No. 4 have engaged in mass movements, and after discovering the waste of labor, they felt very distressed and immediately took action to put idle and non-productive labor into production. After the Hongxiang Shoe Factory in Wuhan launched the masses to make detailed calculations, they discovered that there was a waste of labor in the past, and immediately took action to launch a competition movement to increase production and reduce manpower to support agriculture, saving a large amount of labor. In just one workshop, by reforming the process and eliminating the hair-rubbing process, twenty-three laborers were saved. This spirit and behavior is highly commendable. However, there are still some enterprise leaders who only pay attention to saving materials, but neglect the saving of labor. In fact, whether it is the waste of materials or the waste of manpower, it is ultimately the waste of labor. Because materials are created by people. Saving materialized labor is necessary; saving living labor is even more important. The saving of living labor means the improvement of labor productivity. Marx said: "The increase in labor productivity consists precisely in the following: the part of living labor decreases, and the part of past labor increases, but the situation is such that the total amount of labor contained in the commodity decreases, and the decrease in living labor is greater than the increase in past labor." And the improvement of labor productivity means the development of social productive forces. Lenin once said: "Labor productivity is, in the final analysis, the most important and most important thing that guarantees the victory of the new social system." Therefore, we say that the saving of labor is the greatest saving, and the waste of labor is the greatest waste. We all know that the bourgeoisie does not value living labor; workers are merely objects for them to extract surplus value. We are the working class, and we should, like Gorky, put people, people in capital letters, in a supremely noble position, fully exert the role of people, and attach importance to saving labor.

On the issue of saving labor, we must also have a global perspective. The so-called global perspective means not only seeing that the unit needs labor, but also seeing that the entire country's industrial and agricultural fronts need labor, and considering the arrangement of labor from a global perspective. However, individual unit leaders, when calculating labor accounts, do not calculate the national account, but only the small account of their own department, overemphasizing special circumstances. They grasp labor very tightly, and some individuals even hold the idea of "better safe than sorry" and "wide insurance coefficient," holding on to surplus labor. Such an approach is an act of not having a global perspective on saving labor. The global perspective is an important content of the proletarian political viewpoint. Our starting point and focus for engaging in revolution and construction are for the benefit of the 650 million Chinese people. What the interests of the 650 million people require us to do, we should do first; only in this way can the revolution and construction develop smoothly, and the interests of the people can continue to grow. Therefore, the part obeys the whole, the small obeys the big, and current interests obey long-term interests. This is an important principle that must be adhered to at all times. And currently saving labor is a nationwide task, in order to make the country's socialist construction cause develop faster and better. People with a clear political viewpoint on this issue should take the overall situation into account and be aware of the overall situation. They do not only see the tiny benefits under their noses, but rather "choose the greater of two benefits," allowing partial interests to obey overall interests, secondary interests to obey primary interests, and the interests of general units to obey the interests of key units. Even if the unit also needs labor, it should be drawn out to give priority to satisfying the needs of larger and more urgent key units.

At present, the transformation of agricultural technology in our country has just begun, and the labor productivity of agriculture is still relatively low. Under this circumstance, the global perspective on the issue of saving labor is to first satisfy the labor required on the agricultural front, especially the labor on the grain production front. On the premise of ensuring that the agricultural production sector has sufficient labor, we should make overall plans and reasonably arrange the labor of non-agricultural production sectors, capital construction sectors, service industry sectors, and non-productive business sectors. Marx said: "The number of laborers who can be put into industry and commerce without having to engage in agriculture... depends on how much agricultural products the agricultural laborers can produce beyond their own consumption." This means that how much labor a society can devote to industry, transportation, commerce, culture and education, etc., does not depend on the needs of these departments for labor, but on how much commercial grain the labor engaged in agricultural production can provide for society, how much agricultural raw materials and purchasing power it can provide for industry, that is, on the degree of development of agricultural labor productivity, and on the amount of labor occupied by agriculture. This is an objective law that does not depend on people's will. Therefore, we must pay close attention to the distribution of labor, so that the various sectors of the national economy maintain appropriate and correct proportional relationships. There must be a certain proportion between agricultural production sectors and industrial production sectors, between production sectors and capital construction sectors, between production sectors and service industry sectors, and between production sectors and non-productive business sectors, and special attention should be paid to the proportion of labor occupied by agricultural production sectors. Only in this way can the development of our country's national economy achieve the high speed of the Great Leap Forward and the dialectical unity of planned and proportional. The content of the global perspective develops with the development of the national socialist construction cause. Now the agricultural front is feeling the lack of labor. Therefore, all industrial, commercial, and cultural and educational departments should consider the issue from the perspective that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and arrange the production, work, and labor of their departments according to this general spirit, saving all the labor that can be saved to support the front line of agricultural production.

    从政治上看待节约劳动力问题
    舒子牛
    当前，从各个方面千方百计地节约劳动力，加强农业生产第一线，对于实现国民经济建设的持续跃进，有着极为重要的意义。正因为如此，节约劳动力的问题，就不仅是全党全民所面临的一项重大的经济任务，而且也是一项重大的政治任务。
    劳动创造一切，劳动力是生产力的决定因素。毛泽东同志曾经说过：“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷1516页）这是历史唯物主义的观点。在人和物的关系中，人是根本的。有了人的活动，才有生产中的物；没有人的活动，尽管天然物资十分丰富，也不能造福人类。所以，合理地、节约地使用劳动力，对于社会生产的发展有着极为重要的意义。我们必须首先重视人的作用，既要见物又要见人，要千方百计地去发扬劳动者的积极性和主动性。武钢四公司等单位大搞群众运动，发现浪费劳动力的情况后，感到很痛心，连忙采取行动，把闲散的、非生产的劳动力投入生产。武汉市红翔制鞋厂通过发动群众算细账，发现过去有浪费劳动力的情况以后，立即采取行动，开展了一个增产减人、支援农业的竞赛运动，节约了大批劳动力。仅一个车间，由于改革了工艺，减掉搓毛工序，就节约了二十三个劳动力。这种精神和行为十分可嘉。但是，也还有一些企业的负责人只注意了节约物资，却忽视了劳动力的节约。其实，不管是物资的浪费，还是人力的浪费，归根到底都是劳动力的浪费。因为物资是人所创造的。节约物化劳动是必要的；节约活劳动却更加重要。活劳动的节约就意味着劳动生产率的提高。马克思说：“劳动生产率的增进，正是由下述一点构成：活劳动的部分减少，过去劳动部分增加，但情形是这样，以致商品包含的劳动总额减少，活劳动的减少多于过去劳动的增加。”而劳动生产率的提高，也就是社会生产力发展了。列宁曾经说过：“劳动生产率，归根到底是保证新社会制度胜利的最重要最主要的东西。”所以我们说，劳动力的节约是最大的节约，劳动力的浪费是最大的浪费。我们都知道，资产阶级是不重视活劳动力的，工人只是他们榨取剩余价值的对象罢了。我们是工人阶级，我们就应该像高尔基那样，把人、大写的人摆在无上崇高的地位，充分发挥人的作用，重视节约劳动力。
    在节约劳动力的问题上还要有全局观点。所谓全局观点，就是不光是看到本单位需要劳动力，而且要看到整个国家工农业各条战线上都需要劳动力，从全局出发，考虑劳动力的安排。但是，有个别单位的领导者在算劳动力账时，却不算全国的大账，光算本部门的小账，过分强调特殊情况，他们对劳动力抓得很紧，甚至有个别人抱着“有备无患”、
  “宽打保险系数”的思想，抓住多余的劳动力不放。这样的作法，就是在节约劳动力上没有全局观点的行为。全局观点是无产阶级政治观点的一个重要内容。我们干革命搞建设，出发点和着眼点是为了六亿五千万中国人民的利益，六亿五千万人的利益要求我们做什么，我们就应该首先做什么；只有这样，革命和建设才能顺利发展，人民的利益才能不断增长。因此，局部服从整体，小局服从大局，目前利益服从长远利益，这是在任何时候都必须坚持的一个重要原则。而目前节约劳动力，正是一个全国性的任务，是为了使国家的社会主义建设事业更快更好地发展。在这个问题上具有明确的政治观点的人，应该是顾大局，识大体的。他们不是只看见自己鼻子底下一点微小的利益，而是“两利相权取其大”，让局部利益服从整体利益，次要利益服从主要利益，一般单位的利益服从重点单位的利益。那怕是本单位也需要劳动力，也抽出来尽先满足需要更大更迫切的重点单位。
    目前，我国农业技术的改造刚开始，农业的劳动生产率还比较低，在这种情况下，在节约劳动力问题上的全局观点，就是首先要满足农业战线上所需要的劳动力，特别是粮食生产战线上的劳动力。在保证农业生产部门有足够的劳动力的前提下，统筹兼顾，合理安排非农业生产部门、基本建设部门、服务行业部门、非生产性的事业部门的劳动力。马克思说：“能够投于工商业上面而无须从事农业的劳动者人数……是取决于农业劳动者在他们自身的消费额以外，能够生产多少的农产物。”这就是说，一个社会究竟能够拿出多少劳动力来从事工业、交通运输业、商业、文教事业等，并不决定于这些部门对劳动力的需要，而是取决于从事农业生产的劳动力能够为社会提供多少商品粮食，为工业提供多少农产品原料和购买力，也就是取决于农业劳动生产率的发展程度，取决于农业所占用的劳动力数量。这是一条不以人们的意志为转移的客观规律。所以，我们要十分注意劳动力的分配工作，使国民经济各部门保持适当的、正确的比例关系。农业生产部门和工业生产部门之间、生产部门和基本建设部门之间、生产部门和服务行业部门之间、生产部门和非生产性的事业部门之间都要有一定的比例，而特别要注意农业生产部门所占劳动力的比例。只有这样，才能使我国国民经济的发展，达到大跃进的高速度和有计划按比例的辩证统一。全局观点的内容是随着全国社会主义建设事业的发展而发展的。现在农业战线正感到劳动力缺乏、因此，一切工业、商业，文教事业部门，都应该从农业是国民经济的基础出发考虑问题，并且根据这个总的精神来安排本部门的生产、工作和劳动力，节约一切可以节约的劳动力，用以支援农业生产第一线。
