    Nanchang Dispatch: Workers in agricultural machinery departments throughout Jiangxi Province are actively assisting rural people's communes in modifying and manufacturing rice transplanters.

    Jiangxi Province manufactured more than 93,000 rice transplanters this year, which played a significant role in improving transplanting efficiency and quality. The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party attaches great importance to the promotion of rice transplanters, considering the large-scale promotion of rice transplanters as a very important measure to save labor and increase agricultural labor productivity. The Provincial Committee requested further improvements in the quality of rice transplanters, the timely modification and repair of those that have been damaged or poorly manufactured, and the additional manufacture of 50,000 units according to standard specifications and quality this winter and spring. Workers in agricultural machinery departments throughout the province enthusiastically responded to the call of the Provincial Committee. Party committees at all levels, led by their secretaries, have established special organizations to strengthen leadership in this work. According to preliminary statistics from areas such as Wuyuan, Yugan, and Fuzhou, agricultural machinery departments in various regions have already assisted rural areas in modifying and manufacturing more than 10,000 rice transplanters.

    During the modification and manufacturing of rice transplanters, various regions have dispatched a large number of cadres, workers, and technicians to rural areas to jointly summarize and promote the experience of using rice transplanters with farmers and rice transplanter operators, and to study improvement methods. In the autumn, the Provincial Department of Agricultural Machinery, the Provincial Academy of Sciences, and other units dispatched more than 200 cadres and technicians to rural areas to summarize the experience of using the Jiangxi 59-type rice transplanter in various regions. This type of rice transplanter is very popular among farmers. However, its transmission part is not flexible and sturdy enough. They immediately worked with the farmers to improve the transmission part, changing the transmission slide from a forged iron part to a cast iron sand-cast part, making it more flexible and stable. The director of the Wuyuan County Agricultural Machinery Factory led a technical research team and discovered in rural areas that the rice transplanter's seedling box easily fell off. After returning to the factory, they immediately found a way to change the seedling box transmission shaft to gear transmission, solving this problem. Recently, the Provincial Academy of Sciences, based on the experience of improving rice transplanters in various regions, re-modified the design of the Jiangxi 59-type rice transplanter, making it more sturdy, flexible, and durable, while also greatly reducing the amount of steel used and significantly reducing costs. Currently, ten agricultural machinery factories throughout the province have been designated to manufacture this type of rice transplanter for large-scale promotion next year.

    When repairing and manufacturing rice transplanters, various regions pay special attention to improving product quality. The Fuzhou City Agricultural Machinery Department selected excellent technical workers for special training to ensure strict manufacturing and modification according to specifications and quality standards. Workers at the Yugan County Agricultural Machinery Factory manufactured more than ten indigenous lathes and planers, solving the problem that manual forging made it difficult to control specifications, improving the processing quality of metal parts, and also increasing processing speed. Currently, this factory has assembled more than 2,700 rice transplanters. The Yugan County Machinery Repair Factory has established a three-level inspection system to ensure that parts, components, and finished products undergo strict inspection. They also send workers to rural areas to experiment and improve with farmers until the rice transplanter operators are satisfied.

    This year, various regions have paid special attention to the production of spare parts, accessories, and repair tools for rice transplanters. When the masses reported that the seedling gripper wire was easily damaged, the workers tried to equip each rice transplanter with a set of spare seedling grippers; when one seedling box was not enough and waiting to load seedlings would affect transplanting speed, the workers equipped the rice transplanter with an auxiliary seedling box. Various regions also paid attention to equipping rice transplanter operators with repair tools such as wrenches and pliers. In addition, various regions printed many booklets on the use and maintenance of rice transplanters and organized a group of workers to go to rural areas to teach the technology of using and maintaining rice transplanters.

### 总结使用经验改造老产品　按照标准规格赶制新产品  江西抓紧准备质量优良的插秧机

    总结使用经验改造老产品　按照标准规格赶制新产品
    江西抓紧准备质量优良的插秧机
    本报南昌18日电　江西省各地农业机械部门的职工积极帮助农村人民公社改装和制造水稻插秧机。
    江西省今年制造了九万三千多部水稻插秧机，对于提高插秧效率和插秧质量起了不小作用。中共江西省委十分重视推广水稻插秧机的工作，认为大面积推广水稻插秧机，是当前节约劳动力、提高农业劳动生产率的一项十分重要的措施。省委要求进一步提高插秧机的质量，及时把已经使用坏了和制造质量不好的插秧机改装维修好，同时在今冬明春按照标准规格、质量再制造五万部。各地农业机械部门的职工热烈响应了省委的号召。各级党委都由书记挂帅，建立专门机构，加强对这一工作的领导。据婺源、余干、抚州等地的初步统计，各地农业机械部门已经帮助农村改装、制造了一万多部插秧机。
    各地在改装和制造插秧机的活动中，都派大批干部、工人、技术人员深入农村，和农民、插秧机手共同总结推广使用插秧机的经验，研究改进办法。省农业机械厅、省科学院等单位，在秋季就派出了二百多名干部、技术人员，到农村总结了各地使用江西五九型插秧机的经验。这种插秧机很受农民欢迎。但是，它的传动部分还不够灵活、牢固。他们当即和农民共同研究改进了传动部分，将传动滑道由锻打铁件改为铸铁翻砂件，使之更加灵活、稳固。婺源县农业机械厂厂长带领的技术研究小组，在农村发现插秧机秧箱容易脱落，回厂后立即设法将秧箱传动轴改成齿轮传动，解决了这一问题。最近，省科学院综合各地改进插秧机的经验，重新修改了江西五九型插秧机的设计，使这种插秧机较前更加牢固、灵活、耐用，钢材用量也大为减少，成本显著降低。现在，全省各地已确定十个农业机械厂制造这种插秧机，以便明年大量推广。
    各地修造插秧机时，特别注意提高产品质量。抚州市农业机械部门挑选优秀技术工人，进行了专门训练，保证严格按规格质量标准制造、改装。余干县农业机械厂职工制造了十多部土车床、刨床，解决了手工锻造不易掌握规格的问题，提高了金属部件加工质量，同时提高了加工速度。现在，这个厂已经装好了二千七百多部插秧机。余干县的机修厂建立了三级检验制度，使零件、部件、成品都经过严格检验。他们还派工人到农村和农民一道试验改进，直到插秧机手们认为满意为止。
    今年各地特别注意生产插秧机备品配件和修理工具。群众反映秧爪钢丝容易碰坏，职工们就尽量在每部插秧机上配一套备用秧爪；秧箱一个不够用，等装秧会影响插秧速度，职工们就在插秧机上配备一个副秧箱。各地还注意为插秧机手配备了扳子、钳子等修理工具。此外，各地印了不少关于使用和保管插秧机的小册子，并且组织一批职工到农村传授使用、保管插秧机的技术。
