Current Tasks of Agricultural Mechanization Scientific Research

Tao Dinglai, Deputy Director of the Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences

Agricultural mechanization and electrification are important components of agricultural modernization. The current task of agricultural mechanization (including electrification) scientific research in our country is to study and solve the related technical problems of agricultural mechanization and electrification, apply the achievements of mechanical science and electrical science, and provide technical conditions for the technological transformation of agriculture, primarily for increasing grain production. This task can be roughly divided into the following aspects.

Study and Solve the Problem of Machine Models Urgently Needed for Current Production

Agricultural production requires a large number of usable machines. Although there have been outstanding machines such as rice transplanters, which are unique and original to our country, through the tool reform movement, the number of machine models that can be promoted and applied is still too small from the perspective of overall production needs. This is the most direct reason affecting the improvement of labor productivity.

Currently, more than 90% of agricultural and animal husbandry production in our country still relies mainly on human and animal power. Therefore, in solving the problem of models, we cannot ignore the improvement of agricultural tools and semi-mechanized agricultural tools. On the other hand, China's agriculture already has tens of thousands of tractors and millions of horsepower of agricultural power machinery, and the country's ability to manufacture tractors and agricultural power is rapidly strengthening. Domestically produced tractors have been dispatched to the production front in batches, so we cannot ignore mechanical power and mechanical agricultural tools. Providing the machine models manufactured by national industry and local industry actually includes various large and small, indigenous and foreign machines. Improved agricultural tools and semi-mechanized agricultural tools are generally manufactured by county and commune industries according to local needs and using local materials. It is impossible and unnecessary to demand uniformity. This shows that the work of finalizing machine models is massive and complex. Only by universally launching this work in various places can we achieve results more quickly.

In order to serve current production, the design performance of machines should not be required to be too high, but should focus on practical results. As long as it meets the current production needs, effectively improves efficiency compared to the machines currently in use, and is also adaptable to local resource conditions and technical conditions in manufacturing and application, that will suffice. Finalizing models should not be too hasty. If the model is inappropriate, it will have adverse effects on the national economy in both manufacturing and application. The use of general agricultural machinery can reach ten to twenty years or more, and it is necessary to appropriately consider future development when finalizing the model.

Power is an important issue in research work. At present, efforts should be concentrated on finding various local energy sources, creating related power machinery, and improving the efficiency of existing power equipment. Since the Great Leap Forward, various places have made great progress in the utilization of water power, wind power, biogas, and natural gas, but as agricultural power energy sources, there are still many technical problems that need to be studied and solved. In the drought resistance struggles in recent years, the masses in many areas have used cast iron to manufacture low-pressure steam boilers and power machines. This kind of power machine can not only save a lot of high-quality steel, but also use waste wood, coal, crop stalks, etc. as fuel, and can also be manufactured in general county-level factories or larger commune factories. Summarizing and improving this creation so that rural areas can manufacture mechanical power locally is an important task.

Tractors are the main power for field operations. Several models of tractors, such as the "Dongfanghong," have already been put into production. A large amount of research work needs to be carried out on the structure of these tractors. For example, increasing horsepower is an important topic. According to preliminary tests, the "Dongfanghong" tractor can be increased from 54 horsepower to 75 horsepower after simple modifications, without increasing the weight of the body. In this way, the weight per horsepower can be reduced by 28%, and the labor efficiency of the driver can be increased by 25%. How to make tractors better adapt to the special conditions and requirements of different regions, what different variations should each basic model of tractor have, and how to improve the traction efficiency and operating efficiency of paddy field tractors, and expand the adaptation to paddy fields in different regions are also problems that should be studied and solved.

The research and use of cable traction machines has achieved great success. In the autumn plowing season this year alone, Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, used mechanical and electrical cable traction machines to plow more than 37,000 mu of land. Because of its simple structure and low manufacturing technology requirements, it can be completely solved by local industry, so it is possible to develop rapidly. At present, rural power supply is not yet widespread, so the research on cable traction machines should focus on mechanical power. In terms of structure, attention should be paid to improving the reliability of the traction machine and the working machine, making the unit easy to move, reducing the number of operators, and thereby improving labor productivity.

In terms of agricultural machinery, the first need at present is to provide supporting equipment for the several types of tractors that have been finalized for production, so that these types of tractors can give full play to their role. Among agricultural operations, tillage and land preparation are the common foundation for increasing the yield of various crops, and also the most labor-intensive projects. Therefore, it is entirely necessary and appropriate to concentrate efforts on solving the mechanization of tillage and land preparation operations first, and the research should also first solve the problem of machine models related to tillage and land preparation.

The imported plows and harrows are suitable for most areas of our country, and the effect of mechanized farming and increased production is also certain, but there are also many problems. Many production units use tractors to tow animal-powered double-wheel double-share plows, which increase the plowing width and improve efficiency compared to the original mechanical plows. This proves that the design of the original mechanical plows needs to be improved. In addition, in many areas of our country, due to the characteristics of climate conditions and farming methods, the performance of existing tillage machinery is not fully adapted. For example, the existing machinery is not very suitable for stubble removal and land preparation operations after the summer harvest in North China, and the tillage machinery in the northeast ridge planting area and the southern paddy field area can only be solved by themselves and cannot rely on imports. In the process of achieving further intensive cultivation in various places, more requirements are put forward for tillage machinery such as soil crushing, leveling, and ridging.

In terms of harvesting machinery, grain combine harvesters have a complex structure and consume a lot of steel. Only large factories can manufacture them, and they are difficult to operate and have a low utilization rate. It is difficult to manufacture and promote them in large quantities in the short term. Although the reaper-binder has a simple structure and is reliable to use, it cannot be matched with the various types of tractors in our country, and there is a lack of picking and threshing machinery. As far as rice is concerned, there is still no usable harvesting machinery. It seems that it is necessary to conduct more in-depth experiments and research on various types of grain harvesting machinery.

"Evaluation, Improvement, and Creation" is an important method for solving the problem of models. First of all, we should pay attention to the experimental work of agricultural tools, see clearly which ones meet the requirements and which ones do not, and then improve them. If the problem cannot be solved through "evaluation" and "improvement," it is necessary to carry out bold creation. This should be done not only for the entire machine, but also for certain mechanisms, components, and parts of the machine. Of course, agricultural tools are regional. Due to different natural conditions and farming habits in various places, it is entirely reasonable to have some special requirements for agricultural tools. However, excessively emphasizing the regional specificity of agricultural tools, excessively emphasizing the necessity of self-creation, and ignoring existing machines and research results from other places that may be applicable or slightly improved will often delay the solution of the model problem, and will also be detrimental to carrying out local creation and invention activities.

Research on the Use and Repair of Agricultural Machinery

The use, maintenance, and repair of agricultural machinery are particularly important. This is because agricultural machinery is used in a wide range of areas, in large quantities, and there are many parts that wear out beyond the limit during work and must be replaced. If these parts can be repaired and restored to the original design specifications, a lot of high-quality steel can be saved for the country.

To use agricultural machinery well, we should start from three aspects. First, we should select and use appropriate agricultural machinery according to the natural conditions and farming system of various places. The experience of the past few years has proved that although the deep plowing and heavy harrowing of agricultural machinery have great potential for increasing production, improper use can also lead to insignificant increases in production or even reduced production. To solve this problem, it is necessary to carefully investigate the operation quality of various agricultural machinery under different conditions in various places. For agricultural machines designed according to new working principles (such as using rotary tillers for tillage), it is even more necessary to conduct experimental research to determine the correct usage methods. Second, it is to study how to improve the efficiency of machines and rationally organize mechanized production. Tractors can perform a variety of different operations, and there are a wide variety of operating machines that can be used in conjunction with tractors. How to combine them to fully utilize the horsepower of the tractor and how to formulate mechanical work quotas are all issues that scientific research work should participate in solving. Third, it is to study how to use and maintain machines. Because the working environment of agricultural machines is not good, the field surface is uneven, the operating resistance varies greatly, and the machines are often in contact with mud, dust, rain, crops, etc., how good the driving and maintenance techniques are has a direct and important impact on prolonging the life of the machine. Therefore, technical regulations for the use and maintenance of major machines should be formulated.

Agricultural machines are widely distributed, and repair work should not be too centralized. However, excessive decentralization will also cause difficulties in repair equipment and technical conditions, and it is not easy to adopt advanced repair techniques. In the case of decentralized, small-scale repairs, the "group contracting repair method" can generally only be adopted. The disadvantage of this method is that it is not convenient to implement the division of labor in repairs and utilize advanced techniques, and it is not convenient to test and appraise the quality after repairs. The "replacement repair method" is worth considering. When the machine needs to be repaired, replace it with good parts or components on the spot to restore the machine to normal and use it immediately; and send the disassembled parts or components that need to be readjusted or repaired to a professional repair shop. In this way, only simple disassembly and installation techniques and tools are required in the application unit. China's current rural technical strength is insufficient, and it is appropriate to adopt this method. At present, there is a relative shortage of rural labor, but a large number of tractors and power machines cannot be used due to lack of parts. We should first study and solve the repair technology of several major tractor parts.

Research on Comprehensive Issues Related to Agricultural Mechanization

Production is always comprehensive, and agricultural mechanization and electrification scientific research work should not be limited to the machine or equipment itself, but should include all relevant aspects of production.

The research on tillage machinery cannot be separated from the research on tillage theory. The Soviet Union's compound plow with small fore plowshares is precisely the product of Williams' theory on the formation of soil aggregates; while the moldboard plow and a series of surface tillage implements are the products of Maltsev's tillage method. Similarly, our country's research on tillage machinery should not be separated from our country's tillage theory. Research on sprinkler irrigation equipment cannot be separated from research on irrigation technology; research on sprayers cannot be separated from research on insecticides and insecticidal methods. The connection between agricultural mechanization and agronomy is even more obvious. With the development of agronomy and mechanical technology, many original operation processes can be completely changed more rationally. For example, the application of rotary tillage machines to cut the soil in a rotary manner can replace multiple tillage and harrowing operations and achieve a unique tillage quality.

In the process of crop production, the machines used in each operation are not isolated, but are interconnected. The machinery for sowing, cultivating, topdressing, pest control, and harvesting of cultivated crops should all be adapted to a common row spacing; and the mechanization of the previous operation (such as sowing) can create favorable conditions for the mechanization of subsequent operations. From the perspective of a region, the entire farming system and crop rotation are closely related to the model of agricultural machines. At present, agricultural production tools in our country are still dominated by improved agricultural tools and semi-mechanized agricultural tools with human and animal power. In gradually realizing mechanization, we must consider the coordination between mechanized operations and human and animal power operations.

Agricultural mechanization and electrification can only give full play to their role under certain production planning and basic construction conditions. For example, the effective utilization of tractors is inseparable from the planning of field size, shape, roads, and drainage and irrigation systems. The utilization of electric cable traction machines requires not only land planning but also good planning of the power grid; and the mechanization of pig raising is inseparable from the planning of the pig farm, the construction of pig houses, the supply of drinking water and feed, and the method of manure accumulation. If the research work is not combined with relevant parties, the machine model or the method of using the machine that is created will not be guaranteed to be truly perfect.

There is also a relationship between the research tasks of agricultural machine performance structure, application and repair, and comprehensiveness. The research on comprehensive issues can clarify the conditions and requirements for designing and improving machines, and the purpose of creating and improving machines is to achieve the comprehensive effect of mechanization. However, it is unrealistic to start studying the comprehensive issues of mechanization when there are no basically usable machines. In fact, the development of mechanization always starts with the creation of machines for a certain or several production links. After the basic solution, it creates conditions for studying the relevant mechanization issues, and the research on these mechanization issues in turn requires improving the original design of the machines or putting forward requirements for further creation of new machines. The creation of rice transplanters vividly illustrates this problem. The adoption of transplanters exposed the contradiction between the high efficiency of transplanting and the low efficiency of seedling pulling and straightening, which forced people to study seedling pulling machines and the mechanization of the entire seedling pulling and transplanting process from seedling beds to paddy fields.

Several Issues Related to the Development Direction of Agricultural Mechanization

1.	The problem of improving the operation speed. The operating speed of agricultural machinery was originally inherited from the operating speed of animal power, and today it is generally still in the range of four to five kilometers per hour. But since mechanical power is used, it is entirely possible to be free from this limitation. According to preliminary test results, the existing moldboard plow can be used to increase the tillage speed to about seven kilometers per hour. The existing seed drill can be used to increase the speed to about ten kilometers per hour. If the existing plows and seed drills are simply modified, it is entirely possible to further increase the speed. After the speed is increased, the soil crushing performance of the plow can be better, and the ground after plowing is smoother. The operating quality of harrowing and sowing can also be improved.

2.	The problem of compound machines. Compound operations such as plow and harrow connection, seeder and press wheel connection, harvester and stubble rake connection, etc., are the mature experience of mechanized farming in our country. Compound operations can reduce the number of times tractors travel in the field, save fuel, improve labor productivity, and save agricultural time. Because the number of times the soil is compacted is less, and the connected operations can be carried out immediately and continuously without being affected by the interval, the operating quality can generally be improved. Designing compound operating machines can save the original traction devices, frames, and walking parts of each operating machine, and can also greatly reduce the amount of steel used.

3.	The problem of close integration of power and working machines. From the development trend of traction agricultural tools, through suspended agricultural tools, to automatic chassis and self-propelled machinery, it shows that the integration of power and working machines is becoming closer and closer. This is because only by studying power and working machines as a whole can the maximum saving of steel, the improvement of the utilization rate of machines (or certain parts of machines), and technical and economic indicators be achieved. Although the specific method of combination has not yet been finalized, this trend is worth paying attention to.

In the scientific research of agricultural mechanization, we must carefully summarize the experience of agricultural tool work in our country. Many domestic agricultural tools have the characteristics of adapting to local natural conditions and farming systems in terms of operating performance, and should be carefully summarized. At the same time, learning from the experience and lessons of foreign agricultural mechanization and electrification is also of great benefit, but we must oppose mechanical copying. Facts have proved that as long as foreign experience and domestic experience are well combined, a shortcut can be provided for solving the problem of agricultural mechanization in our country.

    农业机械化科学研究的当前任务
    中国农业科学院农业机械化研究所副所长  陶鼎来
    农业机械化和电气化是农业现代化的重要内容。当前我国农业机械化（包括电气化）科学研究的任务，就在于研究解决农业机械化电气化的有关技术问题，应用机械科学和电气科学方面的成就，为农业的技术改造，首先为提高粮食产量提供技术条件。这个任务大致可以分为以下几个方面。
    研究解决当前生产迫切需要的机具型号问题
    农业生产要求得到大批能够应用的机具，虽然经过工具改革运动，已经有像水稻插秧机这种我国独创的、杰出的机具，但从整个生产的需要来看，可以推广应用的机具型号还是太少。这是影响劳动生产率提高的最直接的原因。
    现在我国90％以上的农牧业生产还是主要靠人力畜力。因此在解决型号问题时，不能忽视改良农具和半机械化农具。另一方面，我国农业已拥有几万台拖拉机和几百万马力的农用动力机械，国家制造拖拉机和农用动力的能力正在迅速加强。国产拖拉机已成批开赴生产前线，因而也不能忽视机械动力和机械农具。提供国家工业和地方工业制造的机具型号，实际上包括了各种大大小小的、土的洋的机具。改良农具和半机械化农具，一般都是根据当地需要，就地取材，由县社工业制造，不可能也不必要强求一致。这就说明机具的定型工作是大量的、复杂的。只有各地普遍展开这一工作，才能较快地取得效果。
    为了服务于当前生产，对机具的设计性能不宜要求过高，而应该注意讲求实效。只要符合当前生产需要，比正在使用的机具确实提高效率，并且在制造上和运用上也能与当地的资源条件、技术条件相适应，就可以了。定型不能过于草率，如果型号不当，无论在制造和运用上，都将对国民经济产生不良影响。一般农业机器的使用可以达十年至二十年以上，定型时适当考虑到将来的发展，也是必要的。
    动力是研究工作中的一个重要问题。目前应当集中力量寻找各种地方能源，创造有关的动力机械和提高已有动力设备的效率。大跃进以来，各地在水力、风力、沼气、天然气的利用方面，取得了很大的进展，但作为农用动力能源，还有许多技术问题需要研究解决。在近年来的抗旱斗争中，不少地区群众用铸铁制造成低压蒸气锅炉和动力机。这种动力机既可以节约大量优质钢材，又可以用废木、煤炭、作物茎秆等为燃料，还能在一般县级工厂或较大的公社工厂制造。总结提高这方面的创造，使农村能够就地制造机械动力，是一项重要的工作。
    拖拉机是田间作业的主要动力。现在已有“东方红”等几种型号拖拉机投入生产。对于这些拖拉机的结构需要进行大量的研究工作。例如加大马力就是一个重要课题。根据初步试验，“东方红”型拖拉机经过简单的改装，就可以由五十四马力加大到七十五马力，并且不增加机身重量。这样每马力重量就可以减少28％，驾驶员的劳动效率可以提高25％。如何使拖拉机更好地适应不同地区的特殊条件和要求，每种基本型号拖拉机应当具备哪些不同变型，以及提高水田拖拉机的牵引效率和运转效率，扩大对不同地区水田的适应等问题，也是应当研究解决的问题。
    绳索牵引机的研究和使用，目前已经得到较大的成就。仅在今年秋耕一个季节，江苏省无锡市用机力和电力的绳索牵引机耕的地，就达三万七千多亩。它由于构造简单，不要求过高的制造技术，可以完全依靠地方工业解决，因此有可能得到较快的发展。目前农村电力供应还不普遍，对绳索牵引机的研究应当以机力的为主。在结构上则应当注意提高牵引机及作业机具的可靠性，并使机组搬移方便，减少操作人员，从而提高劳动生产率。
    在农业机械方面，当前首先需要为已定型生产的几种拖拉机配套，使这几种拖拉机能够充分发挥作用。在农事作业中，耕地整地作业是各种作物增产的共同基础，同时也是耗用劳力最多的项目。因此首先集中力量解决耕地整地作业的机械化问题是完全必要的和适宜的，在研究方面也应当首先解决有关耕地整地的机械型号问题。
    从国外引进的机犁机耙，在我国大部分地区是合用的，许多机耕增产的效果也是肯定的，但存在的问题也很多。许多生产单位用拖拉机牵引畜力的双轮双铧犁，都比原配机犁增加耕幅，提高效率，这证明原来机犁的设计，有改进的必要。此外，在我国许多地区，由于气候条件和耕作方法上的特点，现有耕作机械的性能还有不完全适应的地方。例如华北地区夏收后的灭茬整地作业，现有机械就不十分适用，东北垅作区和南方水田区的耕作机械也都只能自行解决，不能依靠引进。在各地实现进一步精耕细作过程中，对碎土、平地、打畦等作业机具提出的要求更多。
    在收获机械方面，谷物联合收割机构造复杂，耗用钢材多，只有大型工厂才能制造，而且操作困难，利用率低，在短期内难于大量制造推广。割晒机虽然构造简易，使用可靠，但还不能与我国现有的多种拖拉机配套，也缺少捡拾脱粒机具。就水稻来说，现在还没有可用的收获机械。看来，当前有必要对谷物收割的各种机械进行更深入的试验和研究。
    “评选、改进、创造”是解决型号问题的重要办法。首先应当重视农具的试验工作，看清楚哪些是符合要求的，哪些是不符合的，再加改进。通过“评选”和“改进”得不到解决的，就有必要进行大胆的创造。不仅对整台机器如此，对机器的某些机构、某些部件、零件，也应如此。当然农具是有区域性的，各地由于自然条件和耕作习惯不同，对农具有一些特殊要求也是完全合理的。但过分强调农具的地区特殊性，过分强调自行创造的必要性，忽视可能适用或稍加改进即可适用的现有机具和外地的研究成果，就往往会拖延型号问题的解决，而且对开展本地的创造发明活动也是不利的。
    研究农业机械的运用和修理
    农业机具的运用、维护和修理问题，特别重要。这是因为农业机具应用的地区广，数量大，工作中磨损超过限度而必须更换的零件多。如能设法使这些零件经过修理恢复到原设计的规格要求，就能为国家节约大量优质钢材。
    要用好农业机械，应当从三方面着手。首先，是根据各地自然条件和耕作制度，选择和运用适当的农业机械。几年来的经验证明，农业机械的深耕重耙，虽然具有很大的增产可能性，但如运用不当，也会造成增产不显著，甚至减产的后果。要解决这个问题，就有必要在各地的不同条件下，仔细考察各种农业机械的作业质量。对根据新的工作原理设计的农业机器
  （例如用旋转式耕耘机耕作），就更需要经过试验研究来确定正确的运用方法。其次，是研究如何提高机器的效率，和合理组织机械化生产。拖拉机能进行多种不同作业，与拖拉机配合使用的作业机械是多种多样的，怎样组合才能充分发挥拖拉机的马力，机械工作定额应当如何制定，都是科学研究工作应当参加解决的问题。第三，是研究如何运用和维护机器的问题。由于农业机器工作环境不好，田面不平，作业阻力变化很大，机器又与泥土、灰尘、雨水、作物等经常接触，驾驶和保养技术如何，对延长机器寿命就有直接的重要关系。因而应当制定主要机器的使用保养技术规程。
    农业机器分散的面广，修理工作不宜过于集中。但是过于分散，也将引起修理设备和技术条件的困难，不容易引用先进的修理工艺。在分散的、小规模修理的情况下，一般只能采取“小组包修法”。这种方法的缺点是不便实行修理的分工和利用先进的工艺，对修理后的质量也不便于试验鉴定。“换件修理法”是值得考虑的。当机器需要修理时，就地换上好的零件或部件，使机器恢复正常，立即使用；而把拆下来需要重新调整或修理的零件或部件送到专业修理厂去。这样在运用单位，只要具备简单的拆卸安装技术和工具就行了。我国当前农村技术力量不足，采用这个办法是适宜的。目前农村劳动力比较缺乏，却有大量的拖拉机和动力机因缺乏零件不能使用，应当首先研究解决几种主要拖拉机零件的修理工艺。
    研究有关农业机械化的综合性问题
    生产总是综合性的，农业机械化电气化科学研究工作也不能限于机器或设备本身，而应该包括生产的各个有关方面。
    耕作机械的研究，不能离开耕作理论的研究。苏联带有小前铧的复式犁，正是威廉士关于土壤团粒形成理论的产物；而无壁犁和一系列表层整地农具则是马尔采夫耕作法的产物。同样我国对耕作机械的研究，也不应当离开我国的耕作理论。研究喷灌设备，不能离开对灌溉技术的研究；研究喷雾器不能离开对杀虫药剂和杀虫方法的研究。农业机械化与农学方面的连系，更是非常明显。随着农学和机械技术的发展，许多原有的作业过程完全可以改变得更合理些。如旋转耕耘机应用旋转切削土壤的方式，可以代替多次耕耙作业，达到特有的整地质量。
    在作物的生产过程中，各项作业所用的机具不是孤立的，而是相互联系的。中耕作物的播种、中耕、追肥、除虫、收获等机械，都应当适应于共同的行距；而前一项作业（如播种）的机械化则可以为以后各项作业的机械化创造有利条件。从一个地区来看，整个耕作制度，作物轮换，对农业机器的型号有密切关系。我国目前农业生产工具还以人力、畜力的改良农具和半机械化农具为主，在逐步实现机械化中，就不能不考虑机械化作业与人畜力作业的配合关系问题。
    农业机械化和电气化只有在一定的生产规划和基本建设条件下，才能充分发挥作用。例如拖拉机的有效利用，是与田块大小、形状、道路和排灌系统的规划等分不开的。电力绳索牵引机的利用，除了土地规划外，还要求很好地规划电网；而养猪的机械化则与养猪场的规划，猪舍的建筑，饮水饲料供应和积肥方法等分不开。研究工作如果不同有关方面结合进行，所创造的机器型号或机器的运用方法，都将不可能保证是真正完善的。
    在农业机器的性能结构、运用修理和综合性的研究任务之间，也存在着关系问题。对综合性问题的研究可以明确设计和改进机器的条件和要求，而创造改进机器的目的，也正是为了达到机械化的综合效果。不过，在还没有基本可用的机器的时候，要开始研究机械化的综合问题，是不切实际的。事实上，机械化的发展总是先从某个或某几个生产环节的机具创造开始，基本解决以后，才为研究有关的机械化问题创造条件，而对于这些机械化问题的研究又反过来要求改进机具的原来设计，或提出进一步创造新机具的要求。水稻插秧机的创造生动地说明了这个问题。插秧机的采用，暴露出插秧效率高和拔秧整秧效率低之间的矛盾，这就迫使人们去研究拔秧机，以及从秧田到本田的整个拔秧插秧过程的机械化问题。
    与农业机械化发展方向有关的几个问题
    一、提高作业速度问题。农业机械的作业速度原来是因袭畜力作业速度的，到今天一般仍在每小时四至五公里的范围内。但既然用了机械动力，就完全可能不受这个限制。根据初步试验结果，应用现有的铧式犁可以把耕速提高到每小时七公里左右。应用现有的播种机可以把速度提高到每小时十公里左右。如果将现有的犁和播种机加以简单的改装，进一步提高速度也是完全可能的。提高速度以后，犁的碎土性能可以更好，耕后地面更平整。耙地和播种的作业质量也可以得到提高。
    二、复合式机具问题。复式作业如犁耙连结，播种机与镇压器连结，收割机与灭茬耙连结等等，是我国机耕的成熟经验。复式作业可以减少拖拉机在田间的行走次数，节约燃油，提高劳动生产率和争取农时。由于对土壤碾压的次数较少，相连的作业能够即时连续进行，不受间隔影响，一般可以提高作业质量。设计复合式作业机，省去原有各个作业机的牵引装置、机架和行走部分等，还可以大大减少钢材用量。
    三、动力与作业机的密切结合问题。从牵引式农具，经过悬挂式农具，到自动底盘和自走式机械的发展趋向说明，动力与作业机的结合是愈来愈密切了。这是因为只有把动力和作业机作为一个整体进行研究，才能最大限度地节约钢材，提高机器（或是机器的某些部分）的利用率和技术经济指标。尽管目前结合的具体方式还没有定论，这个趋向却是值得重视的。
    在农业机械化的科学研究中，必须认真总结我国农具工作的经验。国内许多农具在作业性能上具有与当地自然条件和耕作制度相适应的特点，应当认真加以总结。同时，学习国外的农业机械化电气化经验教训，也有很大好处，但是必须反对生搬硬套。事实证明，只要把国外经验和国内经验结合得好，就可以为解决我国农业机械化问题提供捷径。
