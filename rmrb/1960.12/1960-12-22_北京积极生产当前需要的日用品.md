Xinhua News Agency, December 21st: Beijing's daily-use industrial goods production departments are concentrating their efforts on increasing the production of more than sixty types of daily-use industrial products urgently needed for people's lives.

This year, the output and quality of Beijing's daily-use industrial products have significantly improved. To further align production with the needs of the people, relevant daily-use industrial departments and commercial departments, when arranging production for the fourth quarter, went to the markets and among the people to listen to consumers' opinions. They discovered that the demand for more than sixty products, such as pots, bowls, steamers, and lunch boxes, was increasing. Based on this change in the market, the leading departments responsible for the production of daily-use industrial products immediately adjusted production plans, reduced the varieties that people did not urgently need, and concentrated efforts on increasing the daily-use industrial products that people urgently needed. When issuing production tasks, all industries and factories (cooperatives) explained the market supply and demand situation to the workers and clarified the production targets. The workers actively sought ways to produce the daily-use industrial products that people urgently needed. Iron factories in Fengtai District and Xicheng District automatically increased the production of iron rice spoons. The Chaoyang Wood Factory, which originally made furniture, lowered its furniture production plan and squeezed out manpower and equipment to increase the production of cutting boards. Workers at the Chongwen District Hardware and Aluminum Products Factory built simple equipment, and successively manufactured more than ten kinds of machines such as punching machines, cold pressing machines, metal rolling mills, and small barrel edging machines, enabling the factory to expand from only producing thimbles, shoe shanks, and trouser hooks to being able to produce various products urgently needed by the people such as aluminum lunch boxes, milk pots, and buckets.

After summarizing and analyzing the work in this stage, Beijing's relevant industrial departments believed that the practice of "concentrating efforts and first producing what the vast majority of people need most" in daily necessities is a good way to adapt to the rapid changes in market supply and demand and continuously balance the production of small commodities. Therefore, when formulating the production plans for small commodities in December and the first quarter of next year, they also made unified arrangements and deployments based on this spirit.

    北京积极生产当前需要的日用品
    据新华社21日讯　北京市日用工业品生产部门，正在集中力量增产当前人民生活急需的六十多种日用工业品。
    今年，北京市日用工业品的产量、质量都有显著提高。为了使生产进一步结合人民群众的需要，有关日用品工业部门和商业部门在安排第四季度生产时，又分别到市场和群众中去，听取消费者的意见，发现锅碗、笼屉、饭盒等六十多种产品的需要量日益增长。根据市场上这种变化，负责生产日用工业品的各领导部门立即调整了生产计划，压缩了那些人们不太急需的品种，集中力量增产人民迫切需要的日用工业品。各行业、各厂（社）在下达生产任务时，都向职工们说明了市场的供需情况，明确了增产目标。职工们都主动地设法生产人民迫切需要的日用工业品。丰台区和西城区的铁工厂自动增产铁饭勺。原来制做家具的朝阳木器厂，压低了家具生产计划，挤出人力和设备增产案板。崇文区五金铝品厂职工大造简易设备，先后制造了冲床、冷压机、金属压延机和小桶卷边机等十多种机器，使全厂由原来只能生产顶针、鞋钎、裤钩，扩大到能够生产铝制饭盒、奶锅、水桶等各种人民迫切需要的产品。
    北京市各有关工业部门在总结分析了这一阶段的工作以后，认为“集中力量，首先生产广大人民最需要”的日用品的做法，是适应市场供需变化快和不断平衡小商品生产的好办法。因此，在制订12月份和明年第一季度小商品生产计划时，也根据这样的精神进行了统一的安排和布置。
