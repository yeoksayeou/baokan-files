Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, December 3rd: The Tibet Autonomous Region Production and Construction Achievement Exhibition opened at the Norbulingka in Lhasa on November 30th. This is the largest and most comprehensive exhibition ever held in Tibet. The various exhibits on display demonstrate the tremendous achievements made in agricultural and animal husbandry production and various constructions in Tibet since the peaceful liberation, especially after quelling the rebellion of the upper-class reactionary group and carrying out democratic reforms last year.

Tan Guansan, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke before the opening of the exhibition. He pointed out that holding this exhibition is to review the brilliant achievements made on all fronts in the past nine years, exchange and promote various advanced experiences, in order to improve the ideological awareness of the broad masses of people and inspire the production and construction enthusiasm of the people of the entire region.

The exhibition hall is divided into eleven sections, including agriculture and animal husbandry, industry, highways, construction, finance and trade (including local specialties and handicrafts), culture and education, and health. The exhibits in the agriculture and animal husbandry hall show that after the democratic reforms in Tibet, the production enthusiasm of the emancipated peasants has greatly increased, and the varieties and yields per unit area of ​​food crops and vegetables have greatly increased compared with the past. Thanks to the care of the Party and the government and the high labor enthusiasm of the herdsmen after the democratic reforms, animal husbandry production has also developed. According to statistics, since 1952, the veterinary epidemic prevention personnel sent by the Party and the government to the pastoral areas have treated a total of 2 million livestock and given preventive injections to 4.8 million livestock.

Many exhibits in the industry, highway, and construction exhibition halls show that the secrets of Tibet's underground treasures are beginning to be unlocked, and a number of factories, power stations, coal mines, and forest farms have also been built. In the past few years, the plateau road construction workers, with the heroic spirit of "making high mountains bow their heads and rivers give way," have built many highways on the Tibetan plateau, where there were no highways in the past, by cutting mountains and filling ravines.

The exhibits in the culture and education and health exhibition halls show that Tibet now has more than 1,500 private primary schools, and the government has also established 13 primary schools and 3 middle schools. At present, there are more than 37,000 primary and middle school students. In the past, Tibet did not have a doctor with medical education, a modern medical institution, or a hospital bed. Now, Tibet has a large number of medical workers from all over the country, and has also trained a group of Tibetan primary medical personnel. One hundred and twenty-one people's hospitals and health centers and clinics have been established throughout the region, with more than 500 beds, providing free treatment for the Tibetan people.

Since the opening of the exhibition hall, many Tibetan people have come to visit with great interest.

    交流生产经验　提高群众觉悟　鼓舞建设热情
    西藏举办生产建设成就展览馆
    新华社拉萨3日电　西藏地区生产建设成就展览馆11月30日在拉萨罗布林卡开幕。这是西藏规模最大、内容最丰富的一次展览会。展览馆里陈列的各种展品，显示了西藏和平解放以来，特别是去年平息上层反动集团的叛乱和进行民主改革后，在农牧业生产和各项建设中所取得的巨大成就。
    中共西藏工委副书记谭冠三在展览馆揭幕前讲了话。他指出，举办这个展览馆是检阅九年来在各个战线上所取得的辉煌成就，交流与推广各项先进经验，以提高广大人民群众的思想觉悟，鼓舞全区人民群众的生产建设热情。
    展览馆分农牧、工业、公路、建筑、财贸（包括土特产和手工业）、文教、卫生等十一个部分。农牧馆里的陈列展览品表明，西藏民主改革后，由于翻身农民的生产积极性大大提高，粮食作物、蔬菜的品种和单位面积产量都比过去有很大增加。由于党和政府的关怀以及牧民在民主改革后劳动热情高涨，牧业生产也有了发展。据统计，从1952年起，党和政府派到牧区的兽疫防治人员，共治疗牲畜二百万头次，预防注射四百八十万头次。
    工业馆、公路、建筑等展览馆里的许多展品表明，西藏地下宝藏的秘密正开始被打开，还建起了一批工厂、电站、煤矿、林场。几年来，高原筑路职工以“让高山低头，叫河水让路”的英雄气概，在过去没有一条公路的西藏高原上，劈山填壑，修成了许多公路。
    文教卫生等展览馆的展品表明，西藏现在已经有了一千五百多所民办小学，政府还开办了十三所小学和三所中学。目前，中小学生已有三万七千多人。过去西藏没有一个受过医学教育的医生，没有一所现代医疗机构，没有一张病床，现在，西藏已有大批来自祖国各地的医疗工作者，还培养出了一批藏族初级医务人员。在全区设立了一百二十一个人民医院和卫生院、所，设置了五百多张病床，免费为藏族人民治疗。
    展览馆开幕以后，已经有许多藏族人民怀着极大的兴趣前来参观。
