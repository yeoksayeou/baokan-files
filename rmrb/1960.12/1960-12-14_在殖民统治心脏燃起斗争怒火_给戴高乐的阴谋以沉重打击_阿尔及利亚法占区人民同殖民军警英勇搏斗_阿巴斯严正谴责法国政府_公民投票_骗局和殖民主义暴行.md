Xinhua News Agency, December 13th: Algiers News: The Algerian people's patriotic and just struggle against French colonial rule and for independence continued to develop on the 12th. The De Gaulle colonial government has intensified the dispatch of large numbers of troops and police from various regions to carry out bloody and barbaric suppression of the heroic Algerian people.

　　On the morning of the 12th, in the Square Prison area near Algiers, the capital of Algeria, more than 2,500 Algerians armed with sticks broke through the blockade of the military and police and marched towards the summer palace, the "official residence" of Morin, the French representative in Algeria, to hold a demonstration. They fought heroically with thousands of colonial troops and police armed with armored vehicles, machine guns, and artillery. French troops opened fire on the demonstrators, killing four and injuring many.

　　In the Kasbah district (Muslim residential area), which was tightly surrounded by French military police with tanks, machine guns, and barbed wire, 200,000 Algerians heroically persisted in their struggle. They waved the flags of the Algerian Provisional Government at the machine gun posts of the French colonial army, shouting slogans such as "Long Live Algeria" and "Long Live the Algerian National Liberation Front." They held high the flags of the Algerian Provisional Government, carried the bodies of martyrs killed by the colonialists, and held parades throughout the district. The colonial army used helicopters to release tear gas and opened fire to suppress the protests. According to Reuters, six to eight people were killed and more than 20 injured. In other areas of Algiers, such as Belcourt, Hamma, Lusso, Bab-el-Oued, and Diar-el-Mahcoul, Algerians held demonstrations on the 12th, carrying the bodies of martyrs killed the day before, and were subjected to brutal suppression by colonial military police.

　　In Oran, at noon on the 12th, 5,000 Algerians held high the flag of the Algerian Republic and shouted slogans such as "Algeria is Ours" and "Let the Algerian National Liberation Front Govern," holding funerals for the patriotic martyrs killed the previous two days and holding demonstrations in the city. The colonial army mobilized tanks and armored vehicles to suppress the protests, making massive arrests and opening fire on the demonstrators. Two people were killed on the spot and more than 40 were injured. The masses heroically fought back with sticks and stones.

　　In Constantine, a city with a population of about 200,000 southeast of Algiers, Algerians also armed themselves with sticks and tools and marched on the main streets of the city. Ignoring the suppression by the military and police, they gathered several times and rushed towards the city center. French military police made mass arrests of demonstrators and built barricades and machine gun positions at all strategic locations in the city.

　　In addition to drawing six paratrooper regiments from the Algerian front to Algiers on the 11th to carry out bloody suppression, the French government dispatched another foreign legion to Algiers on the 12th, and airlifted a batch of mobile police special forces from mainland France into Algiers' Kasbah district to conduct searches. The French colonial authorities declared martial law in major Algerian cities such as Algiers, Oran, and Constantine, banning all gatherings and demonstrations, and conducting large-scale searches and arrests. Paris Radio, controlled by the French government, broadcast on the 12th that the French colonial army had massacred 80 Algerians and injured 1,500 in the city of Algiers alone on the 11th. According to sources close to the Algerian Provisional Government in Tunis, the number of people killed by the French colonial military police was five to ten times greater than the figures announced by the French government.

　　United Press International reported on the 13th that French President De Gaulle, who was forced to end his "inspection" trip to Algeria ahead of schedule today, has decided to order further "severe punishment" measures against the Algerian people who oppose French colonial rule.

　　Xinhua News Agency, December 13th: Tunis News: Algerian Provisional Government Prime Minister Abbas held a press conference in Tunis on the 12th, condemning De Gaulle's recent plan to organize a "provisional administrative body" in Algeria and hold a "referendum" on this issue. He pointed out that the purpose of this plan is to deceive international public opinion and continue to implement France's colonial policy in Algeria.

　　Abbas pointed out that this "provisional administrative body" that De Gaulle is conspiring to create is "merely a smokescreen to cover up the (French) occupation army and the colonial authorities." He said that this plan will inevitably cause "artificial divisions among our people and prepare the conditions for the division of our territory, thereby creating a serious threat to the security of this region of the world."

　　He said: "We firmly believe that France will not find any Algerian worthy of the name to participate in this fraud."

　　Abbas emphasized that "in essence, France is asking us to surrender."

　　When talking about the situation in Algeria in the past two days at the press conference, Abbas said, "The fanatical incitement and ridiculous slogans of the extreme Europeans, the strong patriotic demonstrations of the Algerians, and the shootings that caused casualties to the Algerians – these events emphasize how great the distance is between the French official statements and the Algerian reality."

　　Abbas said, "Our people, from all ethnic groups, are risking their lives not to support (De Gaulle's) masquerade. They feel obliged to face the occupying forces and shout their hatred for the French repression and prove their absolute support for independence and support for the Algerian Provisional Government."

　　Abbas pointed out that "The barbaric acts of the French colonialists, such as killing people, torturing people, and looting, are still one of the disgraces of our time. But this barbarism has proved to be absolutely ineffective. We are seeing – whether people like it or not – that colonialism is being eliminated in Algeria, just as it is in the rest of the world."

　　In response to a question about the possibility of resuming negotiations with France, Abbas said, "France has clearly shown that it refuses all serious negotiations"; "Any effective negotiations with the French government have proved to be impossible."

　　Abbas said, "The Algerian Provisional Government resolutely condemns France's policy, which aims to establish a new colonialism that is as harmful as ordinary colonialism"; "In the seventh year of the war, the Algerian Provisional Government reiterates the Algerian people and their National Liberation Army's determination to continue the struggle for independence, for the complete liberation of the national territory, and for the integrity of the Algerian homeland, at any cost."

　　At the same time, Abbas also elaborated on the Algerian Provisional Government's recent proposal to request the United Nations to "organize" and "supervise" a referendum in Algeria at the press conference. (Attached Picture)

    在殖民统治心脏燃起斗争怒火　给戴高乐的阴谋以沉重打击
    阿尔及利亚法占区人民同殖民军警英勇搏斗
    阿巴斯严正谴责法国政府“公民投票”骗局和殖民主义暴行
    新华社13日讯　阿尔及尔消息：阿尔及利亚人民反对法国殖民统治、要求独立的爱国正义斗争12日仍在继续发展。戴高乐殖民政府加紧从各地调集大批军警对英勇斗争的阿尔及利亚人民进行血腥和野蛮的镇压。
    12日清晨，在阿尔及利亚首府阿尔及尔近郊方形监狱区，二千五百多名拿着棍棒的阿尔及利亚人冲破军警的封锁，走向法国驻阿尔及利亚总代表摩林的“官邸”夏宫举行示威。他们同数以千计的用装甲车、机关枪、大炮武装起来的殖民军警英勇地进行搏斗。法国军队向示威群众开火，四人被杀害，许多人受伤。
    在被法国军警用坦克、机关枪、铁丝网严密包围的卡斯巴区（穆斯林住区），二十万阿尔及利亚人英勇地坚持斗争。他们向法国殖民军队的机关枪据点挥舞着阿尔及利亚临时政府的旗帜，高呼“阿尔及利亚万岁”和“阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线万岁”的口号。他们高举着阿尔及利亚临时政府的旗帜，抬着被殖民者枪杀的烈士的尸体，在全区举行游行。殖民军队使用了直升飞机施放催泪瓦斯，并开枪镇压。据路透社报道，有六人至八人被杀害，二十多人受伤。在阿尔及尔的贝耳库尔、哈马、吕索、巴卜—乌德和迪亚尔—马赫库勒等其他地区，阿尔及利亚人12日都抬着前一天被害的烈士的尸体举行了示威游行，又受到了殖民军警的残暴镇压。
    在奥兰，五千名阿尔及利亚人在12日中午高举着阿尔及利亚共和国国旗，高呼着“阿尔及利亚是我们的”、“让阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线执政”的口号，为前两天被害的爱国烈士们举行葬礼，并在市区举行示威游行。殖民军队调动了坦克和铁甲车进行镇压，大肆逮捕，并向示威群众开火。当场有两人被杀，四十多人受伤。群众以木棒、石块英勇进行反击。
    在阿尔及尔东南约有二十万人口的城市君士坦丁，阿尔及利亚人也以棍子和工具武装起来，在市内主要街道举行游行。他们不顾军警的镇压，几次集结起来冲向市中心区。法国军警大肆逮捕示威群众，并在市内一切战略据点筑起街垒和机亚阵地。
    法国政府除在11日从阿尔及利亚前线抽调了六个伞兵团到阿尔及尔进行血腥镇压外，12日又增调了一个外籍军团到阿尔及尔，并从法国本土空运了一批机动警察特别部队冲进阿尔及尔的卡斯巴区进行搜捕。法国殖民当局在阿尔及尔、奥兰、君士坦丁等阿尔及利亚主要的城市都宣布了戒严，禁止一切集会游行，并进行大规模的搜捕。法国政府控制的巴黎电台12日广播，法国殖民军队仅11日一天在阿尔及尔一个城市就屠杀了八十个阿尔及利亚人、打伤了一千五百人。据在突尼斯接近阿尔及利亚临时政府的人士指出，被法国殖民军警杀害的人数比法国官方宣布的数字要大五倍到十倍。
    合众国际社13日报道，被迫提前在今天结束他在阿尔及利亚的“视察”旅行的法国总统戴高乐已决定下令对反对法国殖民统治的阿尔及利亚人民进一步采取“严厉的惩罚”措施。
    新华社13日讯　突尼斯消息：阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯12日在突尼斯举行记者招待会，谴责戴高乐最近提出的要在阿尔及利亚组织“临时行政机构”并就这个问题举行“公民投票”的计划。他指出，这一计划的目的是为了欺骗国际舆论，继续贯彻法国在阿尔及利亚的殖民政策。
    阿巴斯指出，戴高乐正在阴谋制造的这种“临时行政机构”，“只不过是掩盖（法国）占领军和殖民当局的烟幕而已”。他说，这个计划必然引起“我国人为的分裂，并为分割我国领土准备条件，从而给世界这一地区的安全造成了严重的威胁”。
    他说：“我们深信，法国将找不到任何一个无愧于阿尔及利亚人称号的阿尔及利亚人来参与这种骗局”。
    阿巴斯强调说，“就事情的本质来说，法国是在要求我们投降”。
    阿巴斯在记者招待会上谈到这两天阿尔及利亚的局势时说，“极端的欧洲人的狂热煽动和可笑的口号、阿尔及利亚人的强有力的爱国示威，以及使阿尔及利亚人受到伤亡的那些射击——这些事件强调说明了法国官方声明和阿尔及利亚现实之间有多大的距离。”
    阿巴斯说，“我国各族人民冒着生命的危险不愿支持（戴高乐）这种伪装的把戏，他们觉得有责任面对占领军高呼他们对法国镇压行动的憎恨，并且证明他们绝对支持独立和支持阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府。”
    阿巴斯指出，“法国殖民主义者杀人、用刑罚折磨人、进行掠夺，这种野蛮行为仍然是我们时代的耻辱之一。但是这种野蛮行为证明是绝对不能收效的。我们正在看到——不论人们喜欢不喜欢——殖民主义者在阿尔及利亚正像在世界其余地区一样地消灭。”
    阿巴斯在回答有关恢复同法国谈判的可能性时说，“法国显然已经表明它拒绝一切认真的谈判”；
  “同法国政府进行的任何有效的谈判已经证明是不可能的”。
    阿巴斯说，“阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府坚决谴责法国的政策，这种政策的目的在于建立同一般的殖民主义同样有害的新殖民主义”；“在战争第七年的时候，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府重申阿尔及利亚人民及其民族解放军不惜任何代价地为争取独立、争取国家领土的全部解放和争取阿尔及利亚祖国完整而继续斗争的决心”。
    同时，阿巴斯在记者招待会上还阐述了阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府最近提出的要求联合国在阿尔及利亚“组织”和“监督”公民投票的主张。（附图片）
