Resolutely Implement Policies, Motivate the Masses
Xirang Brigade's Various Productions Undergo Comprehensive Development

    This newspaper reports that Li Yisheng, the Party Branch Secretary of the Xirang Brigade (i.e., the basic accounting unit) of the Xinxu Commune in Beiliu County, Guangxi, seriously implemented the Party's policies, resolutely corrected some shortcomings in the previous implementation of policies, and mobilized the production enthusiasm of the broad masses, resulting in a comprehensive increase in grain, oil, and pig production this year.

    Improving Cadre's Policy Understanding

    The Xirang Brigade had a bad year last year. In addition, the brigade's Party branch and management committee did not seriously implement the Party's policies, and the masses' enthusiasm for production was not fully utilized. The harvests of rice and peanuts were not good, and the income of the commune members was affected.

    Last autumn, Li Yisheng was transferred to this brigade to serve as the Party Branch Secretary. When he first arrived, he felt that the masses' enthusiasm for production was not high enough. After in-depth interviews, he found that the brigade had not strictly implemented the "three guarantees and one reward" system, the work evaluation and scorekeeping were not serious, and the labor force, land, cattle, and farm tools were not fixed for the use of the smaller teams. As a result, the commune members felt insecure and uneasy about production. He thought, "The 'three guarantees' must be implemented, the work evaluation and scorekeeping must be reasonable, and the three-level ownership system based on the team must be adhered to. Haven't the superior Party committees repeatedly instructed us on this series of policies? Why haven't they been well implemented here?" After understanding the situation, he realized that the problem lay in the fact that the brigade's cadres had not studied the Party's policies well and lacked a correct understanding. From then on, he was determined to lead the cadres in studying the policies. The branch also established a study system. In the second half of last year, the branch held more than 20 policy study meetings in conjunction with research work, putting forward all the problems existing in the work and conducting discussions in light of the policies. Through such studies, many cadres deeply realized that to complete the tasks well, they must firmly implement the Party's policies.

    "Three Guarantees" Must Be Implemented

    In order to transform policies into the actions of the masses, Li Yisheng always carried out propaganda on a large scale when implementing the Party's policies, so that the policies could meet with the broad masses, and he often adopted the method of from top to bottom and from bottom to top, mobilizing the cadres and masses to repeatedly discuss the policies, so that the policies could be deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and known to every household. In the second half of last year, he found that the rice production quotas of the Xirang Brigade were too high, and the commune members had great opinions. Li Yisheng led the brigade cadres to publicize the Party's "three guarantees" policy on a large scale and rationally adjusted the production quotas; after the autumn harvest, he promptly implemented the "three guarantees and one reward" system, rewarding those who should be rewarded and punishing those who should be punished. By handling and publicizing at the same time, he mobilized the masses. The masses themselves verified this year's field yields and repeatedly discussed the "three guarantees" plan proposed by the brigade. After the plan was approved by the commune member representatives' meeting, Li Yisheng also signed a "three guarantees" contract with each contracting team on behalf of the brigade. After the "three guarantees" were implemented, the commune members vowed to strive for overproduction.

    Correctly Handling the Relationship Between the Brigade and the Team

    In the second half of last year, the brigade decided to build pigsties, goose houses, and manure pits. How to realize this plan? Some cadres proposed to transfer a group of laborers from the production team as the brigade's perennial construction team, and to call up some bricks, tiles, wood, and breeding livestock and poultry from the production team. Li Yisheng thought that basic construction should be carried out during the slack season, and calling up things from the production team was not in line with the Party's policies, and the brigade could not do this. Later, the brigade took out public accumulation funds to buy wood from Darong Mountain, and also started to burn lime and bricks; according to the principle of paying according to work, a part of the labor force was transferred from the production team during the slack season to build pig farms and build manure pits. Now, the piglets, goslings, and ducklings produced by the brigade are continuously supplied to the teams, canteens, and commune members for private breeding.

    Overproduction Must Be Rewarded

    After this year's summer harvest, some teams had relatively large overproduction and should receive more bonuses. However, some cadres advocated awarding less. Li Yisheng disagreed with this view. He said, "The 'three guarantees' plan was passed through democratic discussion and the representatives' meeting, and it must not be changed arbitrarily. Allowing the commune members to have production to exceed is in line with the spirit of the policy. What reason is there to reduce the overproduction bonus?" Later, everyone discussed whether the production quota was too low. Everyone believed that the quota was not low. The fact that the team exceeded production was the result of implementing the Party's policies and fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the commune members. Therefore, the brigade management committee immediately took out cash and a small amount of goods in kind and awarded them to the overproducing teams in accordance with the "three guarantees" contract.

    In the process of implementing policies, Li Yisheng paid great attention to going deep into the teams to solve specific problems. For example, during the autumn harvest and winter planting, he mobilized cadres and the masses to revise the labor quotas for eleven types of work. Therefore, the labor efficiency of the commune members was significantly improved, and the progress of the autumn harvest and winter planting was accelerated.

### 坚决执行政策  调动群众积极性  西壤大队各项生产全面发展

    坚决执行政策  调动群众积极性
    西壤大队各项生产全面发展
    本报讯　广西北流县新墟公社西壤大队（即基本核算单位）党支部书记李乙生，严肃地执行党的政策，坚决纠正过去在执行政策中的一些缺点，调动了广大群众的生产积极性，使今年粮、油、猪各项生产全面增产。
    提高干部政策水平
    西壤大队去年年景不好，加以大队党支部、管委会没有认真贯彻执行党的政策，群众的生产积极性没有充分发挥起来，水稻、花生的收成都不好，社员的收入受到影响。
    去年秋天，李乙生调到这个大队担任党支部书记，他初到这里便感到群众的生产劲头不够高。经过深入访问，发现大队没有严格执行“三包一奖”制度，评工记分不认真，劳力、土地、耕牛、农具没有固定给小队使用，因而社员心里不落实，生产不安心。他想“三包”必须落实，评工记分必须合理，以队为基础的三级所有制必须坚持，这一系列政策上级党委不是再三指示过了吗？为什么这里没有很好地执行呢？经过了解，才知道问题在于大队干部对党的政策没有好好学习，缺乏正确的认识。从此，他就下决心领导干部学政策。支部也建立了学习制度。去年下半年，支部结合研究工作，开了二十多次政策学习会议，把工作中存在的问题都摆出来，对照着政策开展讨论。经过这样学习，许多干部深深体会到要把任务完成得好，必须坚定执行党的政策。
    三包必须落实
    为了使政策变为群众的行动，李乙生在贯彻执行党的政策中，总是大张旗鼓地进行宣传，让政策和广大群众见面，并且常常采取自上而下、自下而上的办法，发动干部群众反复讨论，使政策深入人心，家喻户晓。去年下半年，他发现西壤大队水稻包产指标偏高，社员意见很大。李乙生就领导大队干部大张旗鼓宣传党的“三包”政策，合理调整了包产指标；秋收后，及时使“三包一奖”制兑现，该奖的奖，该罚的罚，通过边处理、边宣传，把群众都发动起来了。群众自己动手核实今年的田亩产量，对大队提出的“三包”方案进行了反复讨论。方案由社员代表会通过以后，李乙生还代表大队与各承包小队签订了“三包”合同书。“三包”落实后，社员发出誓言，一定要争取超产。
    正确处理大队和小队关系
    去年下半年，大队决定要建猪舍、鹅房和大粪坑。怎样实现这个规划呢？有的干部提出要从生产小队抽调一批劳动力作为大队的常年建筑队，并且要调用生产小队的一些砖瓦、木料和种畜种禽。李乙生想，基本建设应该在农闲的时候搞，调用生产小队的东西，是不符合党的政策的，大队不能这样做。后来，大队拿出了公积金到大容山买了木料，又动手烧石灰、烧砖瓦；根据按劳付酬的原则，在农闲时从生产小队抽调了一部分劳动力，盖了猪场，砌了大粪坑。现在大队生产的小猪、小鹅、小鸭，源源不断地供应给小队、食堂和社员私人饲养。
    超产一定奖励
    今年夏收后有的小队超产较大，应得到较多的奖金。有的干部却主张少奖一些。李乙生不同意这种意见，他说：“三包”方案是经过民主讨论和代表大会通过的，绝对不能朝令夕改。让社员有产可超正符合政策的精神，有什么理由减少超产奖励呢？后来大家又讨论了包产指标是否偏低的问题，大家认为，指标并不算低，小队超了产，正是由于贯彻执行了党的政策，充分调动了社员的积极性的结果。于是大队管理委员会立即拿出了现金和一小部分实物，按照“三包”合同的规定，奖给各超产小队。
    李乙生在贯彻执行政策中，很注意深入小队解决具体问题。如秋收冬种中，他发动干部、群众修订了十一种工种的劳动定额。因此社员劳动效率显著提高，秋收冬种进度加快。
