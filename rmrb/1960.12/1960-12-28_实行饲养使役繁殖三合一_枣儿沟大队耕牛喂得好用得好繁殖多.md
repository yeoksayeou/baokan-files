This newspaper reports from Lanzhou on the 27th: The six teams of the Zao'ergou Production Brigade in Chengchuan Commune, Huicheng County, Gansu Province, have fully utilized the condition of fixed use of cattle and generally established "cattle work groups" to achieve a "three-in-one" system of feeding, utilization, and breeding, and a "four-part" matching of personnel, cattle, equipment, and tasks. The cattle are well-fed, well-used, and bred more, which has greatly promoted production.

After communization, these six teams, based on the "four fixings" of labor, land, draft animals, and farm implements, adapted to the needs of agricultural production, and formed cattle work groups consisting of feeders, handlers, breeders, and disease prevention personnel, known as the "four-in-one" personnel. Under the direct leadership of the production team, they are responsible for cattle feeding, breeding, and completing the plowing, sowing, and other cattle work assigned by the team. The forty-seven members of the six cattle work groups have all become "all-rounders" who can feed, handle, breed, prevent diseases, and treat cattle diseases through mutual exchange of experience and technical instruction. The cattle work groups have formulated a unified management system for feeding, utilization, and breeding based on the principles of centralized feeding, unified allocation, and fixed use. The team implements a "five-package, five-fix" system for the cattle work groups, which includes contracting for grass feed, expenses, fattening, tasks (cultivation, manure accumulation), and breeding, as well as fixing personnel, cattle, equipment, tasks, responsibilities, and work points.

Since the establishment of cattle work groups, the six teams have comprehensively improved the level of feeding management. In the past, those who fed the cattle did not manage their use, and those who used the cattle did not manage their feeding. If problems arose, it was impossible to determine responsibility. After the establishment of cattle work groups, the "four-part" matching of personnel, cattle, equipment, and tasks allows for the arrangement of farm work according to the length of the day, the heat or cold of the weather, and the strength of the cattle, ensuring both the timely completion of farm work requirements and the safety and health of the cattle.

After the establishment of the cattle work groups, everyone worked on breeding and disease prevention, ensuring that all cows were bred, pregnant, and produced calves. Compared with the same period last year, the number of cattle in the six teams increased by 12.4%. In addition, all twenty-seven cows are pregnant.

The "four-in-one" feeding management system can also maximize the enthusiasm and creativity of the members and greatly save labor. In the past, feeding, handling, breeding, and sanitation personnel each did their own thing, wasting a lot of labor. Now, one person has multiple skills and one position has several functions, saving nearly half of the labor. At the same time, because the members of the cattle work group specialize in feeding and handling work, they are proficient in cattle work techniques, skilled in their work, and have high efficiency and quality. From spring to autumn, all kinds of cattle work are completed on schedule. This year, the fall plowing of the six teams was more than twice as fast as in the same period last year, and the plowing was deeper and finer.

The establishment of cattle work groups has greatly saved expenses because grass feed, tools, management fees, and other items are used on a contract basis. Originally, equipment and feeding utensils were replaced once a year, but now they are replaced at least every two years. In the past, there was a lot of waste of livestock feed, but now the practice of feeding according to the amount of livestock, frequent additions and feeding, has blocked waste. According to statistics, the six cattle work groups saved more than 2,600 yuan in expenses this year, and the cattle are still well-fed.

### 实行饲养使役繁殖三合一  枣儿沟大队耕牛喂得好用得好繁殖多

    实行饲养使役繁殖三合一
    枣儿沟大队耕牛喂得好用得好繁殖多
    本报兰州27日电　甘肃徽成县成川公社枣儿沟生产大队的六个小队，充分利用耕牛固定使用的条件，普遍建立“牛工组”，使饲养、使役、繁殖“三合一”，人员、耕牛、套具、活路“四配套”。耕牛喂得好，用得好，繁殖多，又大大促进了生产。
    公社化后，这六个小队在劳动力、土地、耕畜、农具“四固定”的基础上，适应农业生产的需要，由饲养员、使役员、配种员、防疫员称为四员合一，组成了牛工组，在生产小队的直接领导下，负责耕牛饲养、繁殖和完成小队交给的耕地、播种等牛工活。六个牛工组的四十七名成员，通过互相交流经验，传授技术，已全部成为会饲养，会使役，能配种，能防疫，能治牛病的“多面手”。牛工组根据集中喂养，统一调配，固定使用的原则，研究制定了统一的喂养、使役、繁殖的管理制度。小队对牛工组实行包草料，包开支，包膘肥，包任务（耕作、积肥），包繁殖，和定人员，定耕牛，定套具，定使役，定责任，定工分的“五包五定”制。
    六个小队自建立牛工组后，全面提高了饲养管理水平。过去喂牛的不管用牛，用牛的不管喂牛，要是出点问题也无法查责任；建立牛工组后，人员、耕牛、套具、活路“四配套”，都按天长天短，天气冷热，耕牛强弱，安排农活，既保证及时完成农活要求，又注意了耕牛的安全健壮。
    建立牛工组后，由于大家做配种、防疫工作，保证了母牛的全配，全怀，全产。与去年同期相比，六个小队的耕牛增长了12.4％，另外，还有二十七头母牛全部怀犊。
    “四员合一”的饲养管理制度，还能最大限度地发挥成员的积极性和创造性，大大节省劳动力。过去由于饲养、使役、配种、卫生人员各干各行，浪费了很大劳力；现在一人多艺，一职几能，节省劳力将近一半。同时，由于牛工组成员们专门从事饲养、使役工作，牛工活技术精通，业务熟练，工效快，质量高。从春到秋，样样牛工活都如期完成。今年六个小队的秋耕地比去年同期加快一倍多，耕的又深又细。
    建立牛工组，由于草料、工具、管理费等实行包干使用，因此大大节省了开支。原来套具、喂具一年一换，现在至少两年换一套；过去对牲口草料有很大浪费，现在实行按畜定量，勤添勤喂，堵塞了浪费。据统计，六个牛工组今年节省出经费二千六百多元，耕牛还喂养的很好。
