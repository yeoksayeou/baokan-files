Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 22nd: Shuanghe Middle School in Yingshan County, Sichuan Province, located in a mountainous area, focuses on students' ideology, academics, productive labor, and well-being, enabling them to be healthy, study well, and work well.

Under the leadership of the Party branch, the school established a school-wide life management committee, and each class formed life management teams to regularly study and improve students' lives. The branch secretary even went into the kitchen to cook and prepare dishes, inspect hygiene, and lead branch members in creating a high-yield vegetable demonstration plot. Teachers and students have reclaimed more than twenty mu of wasteland to grow vegetables, established specialized groups by class, and engaged in scientific research and experimentation, achieving evergreen vegetables throughout the four seasons. This year alone, they harvested 50,000 pumpkins, and sixteen mu of cowpea yielded 480,000 jin. In terms of livestock breeding, teachers and students breed and raise their own animals. In two years, the number of pigs has increased from two to more than ninety. They also designed, manufactured, and installed a semi-mechanized rice processing plant, which not only processes rice but also processes all the concentrated feed for pigs. In addition, the school also raises a batch of cattle, sheep, chickens, ducks, rabbits, and fish. Students enjoy the fruits of their labor, their diet has continuously improved, and costs have been reduced by nearly half.

The school Party branch attaches particular importance to disease prevention for teachers and students. The branch secretary personally leads teachers, students, and medical staff to the mountains to find herbal medicines, so that teachers and students can take some necessary preventive medicines. Usually, there is enough boiled water and hot water available for students. In order to improve lighting and protect eyesight, the school used the power of the nearby river to build a small power station, installing electric lights throughout the school. Because life is well-arranged and there is a good balance between work and rest, the students are all healthy and have successfully completed the learning tasks of each period.

    据新华社成都22日电　设在山区的四川省营山县双河中学，在抓思想、教学、生产劳动的同时，抓好学生生活，使学生们身体好、学习好、工作好。
    这所学校在党支部领导下，成立了全校生活管理委员会，各班组成立了生活管理小组，定期研究和改善学生生活；支部书记还深入厨房作饭作菜，检查清洁卫生，率领支部成员搞蔬菜高产指挥地。师生们已开垦出二十多亩荒地种上了蔬菜，以班为单位建立专业组，大搞科学研究试验，实现了蔬菜四季常青。今年单是收获的南瓜就有五万个，十六亩牛皮菜收获了四十八万斤。在家畜饲养上，师生们自繁自养，两年来猪只已由两头发展到九十多头。他们还自己设计、制作、安装了一座半机械化的食米加工厂，不仅加工大米，而且加工猪只的全部精饲料。此外，学校还饲养了一批牛、羊、鸡、鸭、兔、鱼。学生们享受到自己的劳动成果，伙食不断改善，费用降低将近一半。
    学校党支部特别重视师生们的疾病预防工作，支部书记亲自带领师生和医务人员上山找草药，使师生们吃到一些必要的预防药。平时并备有足够的开水、热水供应学生。为了改善照明，保护眼力，学校利用附近河水的动力，自建了一座小型发电站，使全校装上了电灯。由于生活安排得好，劳逸结合得好，学生们身体都很健康，出色地完成了各个时期的学习任务。
