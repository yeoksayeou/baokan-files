Xinhua News Agency, December 25th. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a telegram on the 23rd to warmly congratulate the convening of the Sixth Congress of the Ceylon Communist Party. The telegram is as follows:

To the Central Committee of the Ceylon Communist Party, to all the delegates of the Sixth Congress of the Communist Party of Ceylon, dear comrades:

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, representing all members of the Communist Party of China, extends warm, fraternal greetings to the Sixth Congress of your Party.

The people of Ceylon have waged a protracted and heroic struggle to shake off the colonial rule of imperialism and strive for the independence of their motherland. Since Ceylon's independence, the people of Ceylon have engaged in unremitting struggles against imperialists and colonialists in order to safeguard Asian and world peace, strive for complete national independence, build a national economy, and promote social progress. In this struggle, the Ceylon Communist Party has made inspiring and significant contribution.

In recent years, the friendly relations between China and Ceylon, built on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, have been further developed. The traditional friendship between the peoples of China and Ceylon has also been further consolidated and developed. The Ceylon Communist Party has always actively promoted the friendship between the peoples of China and Ceylon, strived to strengthen the internationalist unity between the two parties, and cared for and supported the socialist construction of the Chinese people. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people highly cherish the achievements of these efforts by the Ceylon Communist Party.

Comrades! Your congress is being held under extremely favorable international circumstances. That is, the power of the world socialist system and its international influence are growing rapidly, the colonialist system is rapidly disintegrating under the impact of the national liberation movement, the class struggle in the capitalist world is intensifying, the world capitalist system is becoming more decadent and corrupt, and the socialist forces are increasingly and obviously surpassing imperialism on the world stage, and the forces of peace are increasingly and obviously surpassing the forces of war. The Statement and the Appeal to the Peoples of the World unanimously adopted by the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties, as well as the meeting's strengthening of the unity of the international communist movement, have brought new and great inspiration to the struggles of the international working class, the working people of all countries, and all peace-loving people. We are deeply convinced that, under such circumstances, through the efforts of your entire party, you will surely achieve new and greater achievements in fulfilling the tasks put forward by this Party Congress, that is, in defending Asian and world peace, opposing colonialism, safeguarding national independence and democratic freedoms, consolidating and expanding the national democratic united front, developing and consolidating the ranks of the Party, and realizing the unity of the Ceylonese working class.

                    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, December 23, 1960

    中共中央致电锡共中央
    祝贺锡共第六次代表大会
    新华社25日讯　中国共产党中央委员会在23日打电报热烈祝贺锡兰共产党第六次代表大会的召开。电文如下：锡兰共产党中央委员会转锡兰共产党第六次代表大会全体代表同志亲爱的同志们：
    中国共产党中央委员会谨代表中国共产党全体党员向你们党的第六次代表大会致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    锡兰人民为着摆脱帝国主义的殖民统治，争取实现祖国的独立，曾经进行了长期的英勇斗争。锡兰独立以后，锡兰人民为着维护亚洲和世界和平，争取完全的民族独立，建设民族经济，促进社会进步，又同帝国主义者和殖民主义者进行了坚持不懈的斗争。在这个斗争中，锡兰共产党曾经作出令人鼓舞的重大贡献。
    近年以来，建立在和平共处五项原则基础上的中锡两国的友好关系有了进一步的发展。中锡两国人民间的传统友谊也有了进一步的巩固和发展。锡兰共产党一向积极促进中锡两国人民的友谊，努力增强中锡两党的国际主义的团结，关心和支持中国人民的社会主义的建设事业。中国共产党和中国人民十分珍视锡兰共产党的这些努力的成果。
    同志们！你们的代表大会是在极其有利的国际形势下召开的。这就是世界社会主义体系的威力和它的国际影响急剧增长，殖民主义体系在民族解放运动的打击下迅速瓦解，资本主义世界中的阶级搏斗日益加剧，世界资本主义体系更加衰落和腐朽，在世界舞台上社会主义力量日益明显地超过帝国主义，和平力量日益明显地超过战争力量。各国共产党和工人党代表会议所一致通过的声明和告世界人民书，以及这个会议对于国际共产主义运动团结的加强，给国际工人阶级、各国劳动人民和一切爱好和平的人民的斗争带来了新的伟大的鼓舞。我们深信，在这样形势之下，通过你们全党的努力，你们在为实现这次党的代表大会所提出的任务中，也就是在保卫亚洲和世界和平，反对殖民主义，保卫民族独立和民主自由，巩固和扩大民族民主统一战线，发展和巩固党的队伍，实现锡兰工人阶级的统一的斗争中，必将取得新的更大的成就。
                    中国共产党中央委员会　1960年12月23日
