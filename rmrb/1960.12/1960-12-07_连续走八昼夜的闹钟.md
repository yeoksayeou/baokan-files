    Alarm Clock that Runs Continuously for Eight Days and Nights
    The alarm clocks currently sold on the market generally run for a little over a day on a single winding. The new type of alarm clock recently trial-produced by the Shanghai Daguangming Clock Factory can run continuously for eight days on a single winding.
    This alarm clock also has fifteen jewel bearings, like a watch, distributed on various major parts. Its design is also very different from ordinary alarm clocks, the wear and tear on the parts is very small, and the lifespan is much longer than ordinary alarm clocks. The movement structure of the alarm clock is very small, only two-thirds the size of the original alarm clock, but the precision is very high.

    连续走八昼夜的闹钟
    现在市上出售的闹钟，上足一次发条，一般只能走一天多。上海大光明钟厂最近试制成功的一种新式闹钟，上一次发条，却可以连续走八天。
    这种闹钟还像手表一样，有十五粒宝石钻，分布在各个主要零件上。它的设计也跟普通闹钟有很大不同，机件的磨损很小，寿命要比一般闹钟长得多。闹钟的机心结构很小，只及原来闹钟的三分之二，而精密度很高。
