	Resolutely Support the Struggle of the Congolese People

	The situation in the Congo has developed to an unprecedentedly serious point. The legitimate central government of the Republic of the Congo, the Congolese parliament, and the patriotic forces of the Congo have been subjected to the most barbaric and brutal attacks by the imperialist bandits headed by the United States, under the guise of the United Nations. Under the planning of U.S. imperialism, Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba, Congolese Senate Speaker Okito, House Speaker Kasongo, and some patriotic Congolese central government ministers, members of parliament, and other patriots have been forcibly kidnapped and persecuted by the Mobutu rebel group. They are being subjected to imprisonment and torture. All peace-loving countries and people in the world cannot but express great anger at this barbaric crime of the imperialists headed by the United States in invading and enslaving the Congo.

	On December 8, the Government of the People's Republic of China issued a solemn statement on the situation in the Congo, strongly protesting the atrocities committed by U.S. imperialism and its agents in the Congo. On December 5, the Soviet government issued a statement on the situation in the Congo, condemning and exposing the crimes of U.S. imperialism in using the United Nations to invade the Congo. Our government and our people support the Soviet government's statement. The statements of the Chinese and Soviet governments express the sympathy and solidarity of the Chinese and Soviet peoples with the Congolese patriotic leaders who are being persecuted and tortured by the imperialists and their lackeys, and express the firm support of the Chinese and Soviet peoples for the Congolese people who are heroically resisting imperialist aggression and defending national independence.

	U.S. imperialists and their faithful servant, United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, have shamelessly sophisticalized that the "United Nations forces" went to "help" the Congo "restore law and order." However, look at the Congo today, under the occupation of the "United Nations forces," what a world it has become! The Congolese patriotic army has been disarmed; the Congolese patriotic people have been brutally massacred by the Congolese traitorous groups and the "United Nations forces" under the control of the United States; even the leaders of the legitimate government and parliament of the Congo have been kidnapped and persecuted; the U.S. embassy in Leopoldville has become the command center for the sinister conspiracies against the Republic of the Congo. May I ask, what kind of "law and order" is this? The U.S. State Department spokesman openly proclaimed that Prime Minister Lumumba should be "tried" after the kidnapping and persecution of Prime Minister Lumumba and others by the Mobutu bandit gang. Similarly, Hammarskjöld also came out and clamored that Prime Minister Lumumba should be "tried" in accordance with so-called "laws." From this, people can clearly see that U.S. imperialism is the number one murderer who kidnapped and persecuted Lumumba. The so-called "law" and "order" "restored" by the "United Nations authorities" in the Congo is the robber "law" and "order" of U.S. imperialism to enslave weak nations. U.S. imperialism has already used its own actions in the Congo to tear off its hypocritical mask and completely expose its ugly face as a neo-colonialist.

	The serious incidents of kidnapping and persecuting Prime Minister Lumumba and others show that U.S. imperialism has taken drastic measures, deliberately trying to eliminate the legitimate government of the Congo and replace it with a U.S. puppet regime in order to establish a new colonial rule of the United States in the Congo. This is an important conspiratorial step in the U.S. plan to swallow the Congo. In order to turn the Congo into its colony, U.S. imperialism has always regarded the Congolese Lumumba-Gizenga government, which pursues a policy of national independence, as a thorn in its side. In fact, the propaganda machine of U.S. imperialism has long referred to Lumumba as the so-called "former prime minister" and "deposed prime minister," etc., vainly attempting to create a fait accompli in public opinion that the Lumumba government no longer exists. However, for U.S. imperialism, the greatest sadness is that the Congolese people only support their own elected legitimate government, namely the central government led by Prime Minister Lumumba and Deputy Prime Minister Gizenga. The people of all African countries unanimously recognize the Lumumba-Gizenga government. Socialist countries and all peace-loving countries and people in the world only recognize the only legitimate Lumumba-Gizenga government of the Congo. It is precisely because U.S. imperialism discovered that its various subversive conspiracies had failed to achieve the heinous goal of overthrowing the Lumumba government that U.S. imperialism finally instigated its running dogs to carry out the most barbaric and despicable move, even resorting to the actions of fascist bandits in an attempt to murder the leaders of the legitimate government and parliament of the Congo.

	The events in the Congo have aroused particularly serious concern and vigilance among the governments and people of many emerging countries in Africa, which is very natural. In a joint communiqué issued on December 5, Guinean President Touré and Malian President Keita said that Guinea and Mali "decided to do their utmost to promote a rapid solution to the Congo issue in order to restore the legitimate rights of the Congo, which are now being unscrupulously undermined by imperialist countries under the cover of the United Nations." Ghanaian President Nkrumah and Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie I also reminded in a joint communiqué issued on the same day that "the events in the Congo show that African independent countries and other regions of Africa are insecure, and if African independent countries want to maintain their hard-won independence and strive for freedom for those African countries that are still struggling, they must maintain a high degree of vigilance." The matter is very clear, U.S. imperialism is strangling the independence of the Congo today, and tomorrow, it will use the same vicious means to strangle the independence of other emerging countries in Africa. The fate suffered by the Congolese people today may very well fall on the heads of the people of other African countries tomorrow. The Congolese people and the people of all African countries not only face the threat of old-brand colonialism, but also face the most dangerous and most ferocious common enemy of U.S. neo-colonialists. Therefore, the people of all African countries are increasingly profoundly understanding that they need to unite more closely than ever before, launch a joint struggle, and strengthen their support for the just struggle of the Congolese people to stop U.S. imperialist aggression against the Congo – this is an urgent task for the people of all African countries.

	The Congolese people are now launching a heroic and arduous struggle to safeguard their national independence and save the deep national crisis imposed on them by the imperialist bandits headed by the United States. The struggle of the Congolese people has the sympathy and support of the people of the socialist camp and all progressive mankind. The Chinese government and people will, as always, resolutely support the legitimate government of the Republic of the Congo represented by Prime Minister Lumumba, and resolutely support the patriotic and just struggle of the Congolese people. In its statement, the Chinese government firmly demanded that the imperialist group headed by the United States and the "United Nations forces" immediately stop their aggression and interference in the Congo, immediately stop their persecution of Prime Minister Lumumba, Senate Speaker Okito, and House Speaker Kasongo, and immediately restore their freedom; the criminals who persecuted them must be punished as they deserve; the legitimate status of the central government of the Republic of the Congo headed by Prime Minister Lumumba must be immediately restored and respected. In its statement, our government also issued an urgent appeal to Asian and African countries and all peace-loving countries and people: take immediate action to stop the aggression and interference of U.S.-led imperialism in the Congo, and support the patriotic and just struggle of the Congolese people to safeguard national independence!

	The Chinese people firmly believe that the Congolese people will ultimately stand up, completely defeat all new and old colonialists, and achieve the great victory of the Congolese national revolution. As the statement of our government pointed out: "As long as the Congolese people unite, the just struggle of the Congolese people against U.S.-led imperialism and its agent, the Mobutu rebel group, and to safeguard national independence, with the support of peace-loving countries and people in Asia, Africa, and the world, will surely achieve final victory; U.S.-led imperialism and its running dogs, who have committed countless crimes against the Congolese people, will surely eat their own bitter fruit."

    坚决支持刚果人民的斗争
    刚果局势已经发展到了空前严重的地步。刚果共和国合法的中央政府、刚果议会和刚果的爱国力量，遭到了在联合国旗号掩护下的以美国为首的帝国主义强盗们的最野蛮和最粗暴的进攻。在美帝国主义的策划下，刚果总理卢蒙巴、刚果参议院议长奥基托、众议院议长卡松戈以及一些爱国的刚果中央政府的部长、议员和其他爱国人士遭到了蒙博托叛乱集团的武力绑架和迫害。他们正在受着监禁和酷刑的折磨。全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民，不能不对以美国为首的帝国主义者侵略和奴役刚果的这种野蛮罪行，表示极大的愤怒。
    12月8日，中华人民共和国政府就刚果局势发表了严正的声明，对于美帝国主义及其代理人在刚果制造的暴行，提出了强烈的抗议。12月5日，苏联政府已发表了关于刚果局势的声明，谴责和揭露了美帝国主义利用联合国侵略刚果的罪行。我国政府和我国人民支持苏联政府的声明。中苏两国政府在声明中表达了中苏两国人民对正在遭受帝国主义及其走狗的迫害和折磨的刚果爱国领袖们的同情和声援，表达了中苏两国人民对英勇地坚持反抗帝国主义侵略和维护民族独立斗争的刚果人民的坚决支持。
    美帝国主义者及其忠实奴仆联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德一直无耻地诡辩说，“联合国军”是“援助”刚果“恢复法律和秩序”去的。但是，请看今日刚果，在“联合国军”的占领下，已成了什么世界！刚果爱国军队被解除武装；刚果爱国人民惨遭刚果卖国集团和美国操纵下的“联合国军”的血腥屠杀；甚至刚果合法政府和议会的领导人竟遭到绑架和迫害；美国驻利奥波德维尔的大使馆成了反对刚果共和国的罪恶阴谋的指挥中心。试问，这是什么“法律和秩序”？美国国务院发言人竟在蒙博托匪帮绑架和迫害卢蒙巴总理等的事件发生以后，公开宣扬要“审讯”卢蒙巴总理。同样，哈马舍尔德也出来叫嚷要按照所谓“法律”来“审讯”卢蒙巴总理。由此，人们可以清楚地看到，美帝国主义就是绑架和迫害卢蒙巴的头号凶手。美国操纵下的
  “联合国当局”在刚果“恢复”的所谓“法律”和“秩序”，就是美帝国主义奴役弱小民族的强盗“法律”和“秩序”。美帝国主义在刚果已经用自己的行动揭下了它的伪善面具，而完全暴露出它的新殖民主义者的狰狞本相来了。
    绑架和迫害卢蒙巴总理等的严重事件，表明了美帝国主义已经下毒手，蓄意要消灭刚果合法政府，而代之以美国的傀儡政权，以便在刚果建立美国新的殖民统治。这是美国鲸吞刚果计划中的一个重要的阴谋步骤。美帝国主义为了变刚果为它的殖民地，一直把奉行民族独立政策的刚果卢蒙巴—基赞加政府视为它的眼中钉。事实上，美帝国主义的宣传机器很早就把卢蒙巴称为什么“前总理”和“被废黜的总理”等等，妄想在舆论上造成卢蒙巴政府已不存在的既成事实。但是，对于美帝国主义来说，最大的悲哀是，刚果人民只拥护自己选出的合法政府，即由卢蒙巴总理和基赞加副总理所领导的中央政府。非洲各国人民一致承认卢蒙巴—基赞加政府。社会主义各国和全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民都只承认刚果唯一合法的卢蒙巴—基赞加政府。正是由于美帝国主义发现它的种种颠复阴谋未能达到推翻卢蒙巴政府的罪恶目的，美帝国主义最后策动它的走狗干出了最野蛮和最卑鄙的一手，甚至不惜用法西斯匪徒的行径，企图谋害刚果合法政府和议会领袖们的生命。
    刚果发生的事件，引起了非洲许多新兴国家政府和人民的特别严重的关切和警惕，这是非常自然的事情。几内亚总统杜尔和马里总统凯塔在12月5日发表的会谈联合公报中说，几、马两国“决定竭尽全力促使刚果问题的迅速解决，以恢复刚果的合法权利，这种权利现在是被帝国主义国家在联合国掩护下肆无忌惮地破坏了的。”加纳总统恩克鲁玛和埃塞俄比亚皇帝塞拉西一世在同一天发表的会谈联合公报中也提醒说：“刚果所发生的事件表明，非洲独立国家和非洲其它地区不安全，如果非洲独立国家要维护它们艰苦奋斗得来的独立，并且为那些还在斗争的非洲国家争取自由，就必须保持高度的警惕。”事情是十分明白的，美帝国主义今天绞杀着刚果的独立，明天，就会用同样毒辣的手段去绞杀非洲其它新兴国家的独立。今天刚果人民所遭到的命运，明天完全有可能落在非洲其它国家人民的头上。刚果人民和非洲各国人民不仅还面临着老牌殖民主义的威胁，而且更面临着美国新殖民主义者这样一个最危险、最凶恶的共同的敌人。因此，非洲各国人民越来越深刻地理解到，他们目前比任何时候都需要加紧联合起来，展开共同斗争，加强对于刚果人民正义斗争的支援，以制止美帝国主义对于刚果的侵略——这是非洲各国人民当前的一项紧迫的任务。
    刚果人民现在为了维护自己的民族独立，挽救以美国为首的帝国主义强盗所强加于他们的深重的民族危机，正在展开着英勇而艰巨的斗争。刚果人民的斗争有着社会主义阵营各国人民和全体进步人类的同情和支持。中国政府和人民将一如既往，坚决支持以卢蒙巴总理为代表的刚果共和国合法政府，坚决支持刚果人民的爱国正义斗争。中国政府在自己的声明中坚决要求以美国为首的帝国主义集团和“联合国军”立即停止对刚果的侵略和干涉，立即停止对卢蒙巴总理、参议院议长奥基托和众议院议长卡松戈等人的迫害，立即恢复他们的自由，迫害他们的罪犯，必须受到应有的惩办；以卢蒙巴总理为首的刚果共和国中央政府的合法地位必须立即恢复，并且得到尊重。我国政府还在声明中向亚非国家和一切爱好和平的国家和人民发出了紧急呼吁：立即采取行动，制止以美国为首的帝国主义对刚果的侵略和干涉，并且支持刚果人民维护民族独立的爱国正义斗争！
    中国人民坚定地相信，刚果人民一定会最终地站立起来，彻底战胜一切新老殖民主义者，取得刚果民族革命的伟大胜利。正如我国政府声明所指出：“只要刚果人民团结起来，刚果人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其代理人蒙博托叛乱集团、维护民族独立的正义斗争，在亚洲、非洲和世界爱好和平的国家和人民的支持下，必将取得最后的胜利；对刚果人民犯下了累累罪行的以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗，必将自食其恶果。”
