Reported by the Shanxi Daily: Wang Guojun, Deputy Chief Engineer and Director of the Central Laboratory of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, eats, lives, labors, and consults with workers, humbly and diligently learning from the masses of workers, meticulously helping workers to summarize and improve advanced operating methods and advanced experiences, and tackling technical bottlenecks in production together with workers, which has played a significant role in promoting the increase of steel output in the factory. The workers praise him as "an engineer of the working class."

In April of this year, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company transferred 100 leading cadres to go deep into the workshops to help with work. Wang Guojun was assigned to the Second Steelmaking Plant. Initially, although they lived in the factory, they mainly relied on looking at reports and listening to briefings to carry out their work. Therefore, many problems were discovered, but few were solved. Wang Guojun was very distressed. He thought: "I am an engineer, how can I not come up with countermeasures?"

At this time, the company's Party committee called on leading cadres to go deep into the teams, and appointed Wang Guojun as the concurrent Deputy Director of the Second Steelmaking Plant. After Wang Guojun arrived at the Second Steelmaking Plant, he requested the Second Steel Plant Party committee to follow the shifts of the Wang Fuguan team of the No. 11 converter workshop.

　　Grasp Technology, First Grasp Ideology

On the first day of Wang Guojun's following shift, he caught up with the Wang Fuguan team dismantling the furnace. He followed the workers down into the furnace pit, which was more than one meter deep, to remove the dismantled furnace lining bricks. More than ten tons of scalding hot furnace lining bricks were impossible to approach without cooling water; once water was applied, they would pulverize and the hot air would spread, choking people. The team leader Wang Fuguan, fearing that Wang Guojun could not bear the hardship, repeatedly asked him to come up. However, Wang Guojun's heart had long been attracted. He thought: "No wonder the converter turnover time is long, the workers' clearing of the furnace pit is so difficult. Coupled with the time for dismantling and building the furnace, how can the turnover time of the furnace not be prolonged?" After clearing the furnace pit, Wang Guojun used the gaps in time to study with the workers the method of changing this working condition. Some workers said: "We are used to working this way, there is no other way." At this time, Wang Guojun began to promote to the workers the use of a movable furnace seat, which he had thought about in the furnace pit. This could shorten the time for dismantling, building, and clearing the furnace pit, and improve working conditions. The workers said: "We have tried it before, but it didn't work." Why didn't it work? After everyone talked for a long time, it boiled down to one thing: not being used to it, and another: the leadership's lack of determination in promoting it. Wang Guojun repeatedly explained to the workers the role of using a movable furnace seat in increasing steel output, and expressed the factory leadership's determination to promote the movable furnace seat. The movable furnace seat was promoted throughout the factory. Wang Guojun came to the conclusion that engineering and technical personnel must not only solve technical problems through practice, but also solve the ideological problems of workers in the process of promoting new technologies.

　　In-depth Work Can Truly Solve Problems

Before Wang Guojun followed the shifts, the Second Steelmaking Plant had experienced a series of blocked tuyere accidents. People discussed and said: "Blocked tuyeres are caused by the dereliction of duty of the workers." Wang Guojun had also had this understanding. He even thought about punishing several team leaders to eliminate the blocked tuyeres. But after he participated in labor, he saw with his own eyes: backward teams had blocked tuyeres, and advanced teams also had blocked tuyeres. He thought: "Since blocked tuyeres have become a relatively common phenomenon, then it is not a problem of dereliction of duty by a certain individual." One day, he organized rapid steelmaking in the No. 11 furnace B shift and found that the wind box was leaking air seriously. He then ordered Guo Yushuan, the secretary of the B shift branch, to solve the problem of the wind box leaking air. After the problem of the wind box leaking air was solved, the blocked tuyere accidents were reduced. Experiments were also conducted on several other furnaces, and the results were also very good. Wang Guojun and other engineering and technical personnel and veteran workers analyzed this situation theoretically and found that the wind box leaked air, and the wind weakened before reaching the tuyere, so that the molten iron was easily cooled, thereby blocking the tuyere brick. Wang Guojun also came to the conclusion that once technical problems become a common phenomenon, the first thing to do to find a solution is to overcome the bureaucracy of engineering and technical personnel.

　　First Be a Student, Then Be a Teacher

At the same time that Wang Guojun was solving the problem of blocked tuyeres with everyone, the problem of furnace collapse in the converter workshop of the Second Steelmaking Plant was also developing very seriously.

Once, the No. 10 converter had just been built, and the tuyere bricks collapsed after only ten minutes of blowing. When Wang Guojun and the workers of the No. 10 furnace were feeling upset, the Wang Qihai bricklaying team of the A shift came to work. Wang Guojun said to Wang Qihai: "The newly built furnace collapsed, what is the reason?" Wang Qihai replied with confidence: "Bricklaying is not the same as bricklaying! The furnaces we build will not collapse." When Wang Guojun heard this, he felt that there was something to it, so he kept following the Wang Qihai team to work, observing the characteristics of their bricklaying. He found that the fourteen members of this team were very orderly in their work; who laid the furnace bottom, who laid the tuyere, and who laid the furnace wall were specifically assigned; he also saw that when they laid the tuyere bricks, they used their hands to fill the gaps with magnesia little by little. After the furnace was built, it was refined for twenty or thirty times, and there was no furnace collapse. Wang Guojun personally visited Wang Qihai, carefully studied their bricklaying methods, and patiently helped him summarize his experience. Later, with the assistance of the three-way combination team in the factory, it took three days to summarize the bricklaying experience of the Wang Qihai team and organize learning and promotion throughout the workshop. In October, the average furnace life of the first workshop was thirty-two times, and the highest furnace life of the No. 4 furnace was over forty-two times. Here, Wang Guojun also came to the conclusion that the role of engineering and technical personnel on the front line of production is to summarize the unsystematic technical knowledge of workers into systematic technical experience through practice, and to disseminate and promote it.

Wang Guojun follows a principle when summarizing and promoting the advanced technology of the masses: be a student when summarizing the advanced experience of the masses; be a teacher when promoting the advanced experience of the masses. On the front line of production, he can carefully study the advanced operating skills of each worker; after learning, he can use the advanced experience of the masses to guide the masses to innovate technology and solve key production problems. Take the matter of molten iron running on the iron track as an example, it once caused Wang Guojun to spend a lot of time around the melting furnace, but it was never solved. Once, an old bricklayer from the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Construction Engineering Company said to Wang Guojun: "The furnace lining of the melting furnace is made of tar bricks. When they are laid tightly, the tar melts after burning, and there are gaps, so how can the molten iron not run out?" Wang Guojun asked: "Can you think of a way to prevent it from running out?" The old worker said: "Burn the bricks first and then lay them, and I don't think there will be any gaps." After testing, the effect was very good. At the same time, Wang Guojun also visited the old worker Yang Wenlian and listened to the suggestion of widening the iron track. After comprehensively learning from the experience and suggestions of the old workers, he studied with other engineering and technical personnel, added an iron plate, and solved the key problem of molten iron running on the iron track of the melting furnace.

The workers of the Second Steelmaking Plant all say of Wang Guojun: "He takes a good mass line in technology." Young engineering and technical personnel all regard Wang Guojun as a model for their own learning.

    深入现场  跟班劳动  学习总结推广工人的先进操作经验
    工程师王国钧群众路线走得好
    本报讯　据山西日报消息：太原钢铁公司副总工程师、中心试验室主任王国钧，和工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，虚心刻苦地向工人群众学习，深入细致地帮助工人总结，提高先进的操作方法和先进经验，和工人一起攻打生产中的技术关键，对推动该厂钢产量的增长起了很大作用。工人群众称赞他是“工人阶级的工程师”。
    今年4月份，太钢抽调了一百名领导干部深入车间帮助工作，王国钧被分配到第二炼钢厂。起初，他们虽然住在厂里，可是主要靠看表报、听汇报进行工作。因此，问题发现的不少，解决的却不多。王国钧很苦恼，他想：自己是工程师，怎么就想不出对策呢？
    这时，公司党委号召领导干部深入小组，并确定王国钧兼任第二炼钢厂的第二厂长。王国钧到第二炼钢厂后，便向二钢党委要求，到二车间十一号转炉乙班王富官小组去跟班劳动。
    抓技术　先抓思想
    王国钧跟班劳动的第一天，就赶上王富官小组拆炉。他跟随工人们下到一丈多深的炉坑里，清除拆下来的炉衬砖。十几吨滚烫的炉衬砖，不打水冷却，简直使人无法接近；打上水，一经粉化，热气四溢，又呛得人喘不过气来。小组长王富官生怕王国钧吃不了苦，三番五次叫他上来。可是，王国钧的心早就被吸引住了。他想：“难怪转炉周转时间长，工人清炉坑这么费劲，再加上拆炉、砌炉时间，怎能不拖长炉子的周转时间呢？”清毕炉坑，王国钧利用空隙时间，和工人们研究改变这种工作条件的办法。有的工人说：“我们已经这样工作惯了，没有别的办法”。这时王国钧便向工人宣传起他在炉坑里想过的采用活炉座，既可以缩短拆炉、砌炉、清炉坑的时间，又可以改善劳动条件。工人们说：“过去也试用过，可是行不通”。为什么行不通？大家七嘴八舌说了半晌，归结起来，一条是不习惯，另一条是领导推行的不坚决。王国钧反复向工人解释了采用活炉座对提高钢产量的作用，并表示了厂领导推行活炉座的决心。活炉座在全厂推行开了。王国钧得出一条经验：工程技术人员不仅要通过实践解决技术问题，还必须解决工人在推广新技术过程中的思想问题。
    工作深入才能真正解决问题
    在王国钧跟班劳动以前，二钢曾接二连三地发生糊风眼事故。人们议论说：“糊风眼，是工人失职造成的。”王国钧也有过这样认识，他甚至想过，要处分几个小组长来达到消灭糊风眼的目的。可是当他参加劳动以后，亲眼看到：落后小组糊风眼，先进小组也糊风眼。他想：“既然糊风眼成了比较普遍的现象，那就不是某一个人失职的问题了”。有一天，他在十一号炉乙班组织快速炼钢，发现风箱跑风很严重，于是便责成乙班支部书记郭玉拴解决风箱跑风问题。风箱跑风问题解决后，糊风眼的事故减少了。又在几个炉子上试验，效果也很好。王国钧和其他工程技术人员、老工人把这种情况提到理论上来一分析，发现风箱跑风，风在到达风眼附近就减弱了，这样，铁水便容易冷却，从而糊住了风眼砖。王国钧又得出了一条经验：技术问题，一旦成了普遍现象，寻找解决的办法，首先要克服工程技术人员的官僚主义。
    先当学生　后当先生
    就在王国钧跟大伙一道解决糊风眼问题的同时，二钢转炉车间的塌炉问题，也发展得很严重了。
    有一次，十号转炉刚刚砌好，吹了十几分钟就塌了风眼砖。王国钧和十号炉工人，正在心烦意乱的时候，甲班王七海砌炉小组上班了。王国钧对王七海说：“刚砌好的炉就塌了，什么道理呢？”王七海胸有成竹地回答：“砌炉和砌炉还不一样哩！我们砌的炉就不塌”。王国钧一听，觉得话里有文章，便一直跟着王七海小组劳动，观察他们砌炉的特点。他发现这个小组的十四个人，在工作中非常有秩序；谁砌炉底，谁砌风眼，谁砌炉墙，分工具体；又见他们在砌风眼砖的时候，用手一点一点地往空隙里塞镁砂。炉子砌好以后，炼了二、三十次，也没有塌炉。王国钧便亲自去访问王七海，细致地学习他们的砌炉方法，耐心地帮助他总结经验。以后又经过厂里三结合小组的协助，用三天时间把王七海小组的砌炉经验进行了总结，在全车间组织学习推广。10月份，一车间平均炉龄三十二次，四号炉最高炉龄到过四十二次。这里王国钧又得出了一条经验：工程技术人员在生产第一线的作用，就是要通过实践，把工人不系统的技术知识，总结成系统的技术经验，加以传播、推广。
    王国钧在总结、推广群众先进技术的时候，遵循着一条原则：在总结群众先进经验的时候，要当学生；在推广群众先进经验的时候，要当先生。他在生产第一线，对每个工人的先进操作技术，都能精心地学习；在学习过后，他又能运用群众的先进经验，指导群众革新技术，解决生产关键。就拿过铁道跑铁这件事来说吧，它曾经使王国钧在化铁炉周围花去了许多时间，一直没有解决。有一次，一个从太钢建筑工程公司来的砌炉老工人对王国钧说：“化铁炉的炉衬是焦油砖，砌的时候严实合缝，经过燃烧，焦油化了，就出了空子，还能不往外跑铁？”王国钧问：“能不能想办法不让它跑铁呢？”老工人说：“先把砖烧一下，然后再砌，我看就不会出缝子了”。经过试验，效果很好。同时，王国钧又访问了老工人杨文连，听取了加宽过铁道的建议。他综合学习了老工人的经验和建议以后，又和其他工程技术人员研究，加上一块铁板，就使化铁炉过铁道跑铁的关键问题解决了。
    二钢的工人们提起王国钧都说：“技术上走群众路线走得好”。年轻的工程技术人员，都把王国钧当作自己学习的榜样。
