    Celebrating the Fifth Anniversary of the Sino-German Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation

    Today, December 25th, marks the fifth anniversary of signing the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic. This treaty, signed in Beijing five years ago, is a symbol of the further development and consolidation of the friendly and cooperative relations between our two peoples. Over the past five years, our two peoples, in the spirit of this Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, have made joint efforts both in developing and strengthening the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries and in safeguarding world peace and the security of Asia and Europe. In the future, we believe that our two governments and peoples will, based on this treaty, make even greater efforts.

    There is a deep friendship between the people of China and Germany. In the past revolutionary struggles and today's socialist construction, the people of the two countries have sympathized with and supported each other. The People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic were both established in October 1949. Over the past eleven years, China and Germany have successively signed the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation and agreements on trade, culture, science, and technology, greatly strengthening the friendship between the two peoples and the economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries.

    The People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic are fraternal countries of the great socialist camp, one standing on the eastern frontier of this camp and the other on the western frontier of this camp. The people of the two countries have always supported each other and cooperated closely in the common struggle against imperialism and in defense of world peace. The Chinese government and people have always firmly supported the struggle of the people of the German Democratic Republic against West German militarism, supported the efforts of the people of the German Democratic Republic to strive for the reunification of their motherland on a peaceful and democratic basis, and supported the German Democratic Republic's proposal to turn West Berlin into a free city. The government and people of the German Democratic Republic have also actively supported our people's struggle to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity. We express our heartfelt gratitude for this fraternal support and the assistance given to our socialist construction!

    The Statement of the Moscow Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties emphasized the particularly important role played by the German Democratic Republic in the struggle against the aggressive ambitions of West German militarism. The participants in the meeting believe that it is the duty of all socialist countries and all peace-loving people to defend the inviolability of the German Democratic Republic, the outpost of socialism in Western Europe and the true embodiment of the German people's desire for peace. The meeting's statement also pointed out: "The experience of the development of socialist countries once again shows that the most important international conditions for their achievements and successes are: mutual assistance and mutual support, and the use of all the advantages of the solidarity of the socialist camp." The Chinese people highly cherish the friendly solidarity with all fraternal countries in the socialist camp, including the German Democratic Republic, because the unity of all brothers in the socialist family is the main guarantee that the socialist camp is strong, that the socialist system is invincible, and that world peace can be maintained. The Chinese people are willing to work together with the people of the German Democratic Republic to strengthen the friendship between the two peoples, to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp, and to advance hand in hand for the common cause of opposing imperialism, safeguarding world peace, and achieving victory for socialism!

    On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-German Friendship and Cooperation Treaty, we heartily congratulate the German Democratic Republic on its prosperity and strength, and on its new achievements in socialist construction and in the cause of striving for national reunification and safeguarding European peace. We wish the friendship between the Chinese and German peoples, which has developed in the common struggle, will last forever!

    庆祝中德友好合作条约五周年
    今年12月25日，是中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国友好合作条约签订的五周年。五年前在北京签订的这一友好合作条约，是我们两国人民友好合作关系的进一步发展和巩固的标志。五年来，我们两国人民本着这个友好合作条约的精神，不论在发展和加强两国之间的友好合作关系方面，在维护世界和平和欧亚两洲的安全方面，都作出了共同的努力。在今后，我们相信，我们两国政府和人民，必将根据这个条约，作出更多的努力。
    中德两国人民之间有着深厚的友谊。在两国人民过去的革命斗争中和今天的社会主义建设中，都彼此同情，互相支援。中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国都是在1949年10月先后成立的。十一年来，中德两国先后签订了友好合作条约和贸易、文化、科学技术等协定，大大加强了两国人民的友谊和两国的经济文化合作。
    中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国是伟大社会主义阵营的兄弟国家，一个站在这个阵营的东方前哨，一个站在这个阵营的西方前哨。两国人民在反对帝国主义、维护世界和平的共同斗争中一直互相支持，密切合作。中国政府和中国人民一向坚决支持德意志民主共和国人民反对西德军国主义的斗争，支持德意志民主共和国人民为争取在和平民主的基础上统一祖国而进行的努力，支持德意志民主共和国政府把西柏林变成自由城市的主张。德意志民主共和国政府和人民，也积极支持我国人民维护主权和领土完整的斗争。我们对于这种兄弟般的支持和给予我国社会主义建设的援助表示衷心的感谢！
    莫斯科各国共产党和工人党代表会议声明强调指出了德意志民主共和国在反对西德军国主义的侵略野心的斗争中所起的特别重大的作用。会议参加者认为，保卫社会主义在西欧的前哨、德国人民爱好和平的愿望的真正体现者——德意志民主共和国不受侵犯，是社会主义阵营所有国家和一切爱好和平人民的义务。会议的声明又指出：“社会主义各国发展的经验再一次表明，它们获得成就和成绩的最重要的国际条件是：相互援助和相互支持，利用社会主义阵营各国团结一致的一切优越性。”中国人民十分珍视同社会主义阵营所有兄弟国家包括同德意志民主共和国的友好团结，因为社会主义大家庭所有兄弟的团结，是社会主义阵营之所以强大，是社会主义体系之所以不可战胜，是世界和平之所以能被维护住的主要保证。中国人民愿意同德意志民主共和国人民一起，为加强两国人民的友谊，为加强社会主义阵营的团结，为反对帝国主义、维护世界和平和社会主义的共同事业的胜利，齐心协力，携手并进！
    值此中德友好合作条约签订五周年，我们衷心地祝贺德意志民主共和国繁荣昌盛，在社会主义建设事业和争取祖国统一、维护欧洲和平的事业中取得新的成就，祝贺中德两国人民在共同斗争中发展起来的友谊万古长青！
