Add Enough Measures
Chen Zhiyan

The leadership method of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's Converter Plant No. 1, published on this page today, may not seem particularly new or miraculous, but it is a reliable method for directing production that ensures invincibility.

The advantage and characteristic of a well-led, advanced enterprise is often not reflected in a rapid increase in production within a short period, but in a continuous and stable increase in production over a relatively long period. Achieving this is not insurmountable. The problem is to truly and practically do all the work that should be done thoroughly.

How is work done thoroughly? It's difficult to define a formula, but there are a few things that must be achieved.

The first is to have sufficient confidence, filled with the vigorous and ambitious revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. This is crucial, acting as a powerful driving force that propels us forward.

However, the development of any revolutionary cause will encounter various problems (contradictions, difficulties, unfavorable factors, etc.). If you want production to increase continuously and steadily, you may have a series of problems coming your way. An experienced enterprise leader does not wait for problems to find them, but anticipates all possible problems as much as possible beforehand. (Whether you can anticipate them depends on whether you are familiar with the actual production and whether you have conducted thorough investigation and research.)

Full of energy and having thought through the problems sufficiently puts you in a proactive position. This is the second point.

However, no problem will solve itself automatically. You have to open your mouth to take a bite of food, and you need a measure to solve a problem. Measures must not only be specific but also sufficient. Why? Because people are not gods after all, and cannot foresee all possible problems in the production process. Because some problems will not be exposed until a certain time. Therefore, a foolproof plan must be adopted. This means adding enough measures, adding enough to achieve ten out of ten targets, with twelve out of ten measures. This way, no matter what new problems arise, you will not be caught off guard and will have a solution. This is the third point. The most prominent aspect of the leadership method of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's Converter Plant No. 1 is this.

Recently, we have all been studying Volume IV of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." What beneficial lessons do we learn from the articles related to the Liberation War? To despise all reactionaries. No matter how seemingly powerful the reactionaries are, they can be defeated. However, when fighting the enemy, we must see each and every specific difficulty. Difficulties can be overcome, but we must make practical preparations and never fight a battle we are not sure of winning. Every battle must concentrate an absolutely superior force (two, three, four, and sometimes even five or six times the enemy's strength), surround the enemy on all sides, and strive for complete annihilation, leaving no one to escape.

It was under the guidance of this brilliant strategic thinking of Chairman Mao that we won the victory in the revolutionary war.

Production is another kind of battle. The "enemies" in production are those contradictions, difficulties, and unfavorable factors. Towards these "enemies," we must also despise them as a whole and hold a belief in certain victory. But in every specific problem, we must not only not underestimate them, but also have a sufficient estimate of them. And we must also not fight battles we are not sure of winning, and take sufficient measures to overcome them.

The comrades of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's Converter Plant No. 1 have achieved continuous and stable production increases by using this steady and practical working method. They have thought through all possible problems in production one by one, and have taken measures one by one. They have not only taken relatively sufficient measures in key production areas and major work types, but also taken thorough measures for those "small places" (minor work types, auxiliary departments, small links) that do not attract much attention. For some important links, they have not only set up one line of defense, but also several lines of defense. This creates a superior force, fights battles with certainty, and ensures complete victory.

In war, occupying cities is the result of annihilating the enemy's vital forces. In production, continuous and stable production increase is the result of taking various measures and constantly solving specific problems one by one.

What are the characteristics of this leadership method? It is the combination of the proletariat's revolutionary boldness, scientific spirit, and pragmatic attitude.

Now that there are only twenty days left until the end of the year, we must add enough measures, especially for safe production, protection against cold and frost and fire prevention, equipment maintenance, and arranging workers' lives, etc., and set up lines of defense. Create a force several times superior to the "enemy." Every item must be thoroughly inspected to see if it is done practically. For example, in safe production, has each work process been checked? Are the materials for protection against cold and frost fully prepared? Are the lives of workers, especially those underground, in front of the furnace, and train drivers, arranged properly? When adding measures, we must not neglect those "small problems." For example, whether the miners' lamps used by the miners are sufficient is a "small problem," but if you don't pay attention, it will affect coal mining and tunneling efficiency. If these problems are properly solved one by one, and the work is done thoroughly, we will be more confident in completing this year's industrial production plan with steel as the key target ahead of schedule and exceeding the target.

### 把措施加够

    把措施加够
    陈之衍
    今天这块版上发表的重庆钢铁公司转炉一厂的领导方法，看起来，并没有什么特别新奇神妙的地方，但却是一个立于不败之地的指挥生产的可靠方法。
    一个领导有方的先进企业，它的优点和特点，往往并不表现在一个短时期内生产上升很快，而是表现在一个相当长的时期内，生产都能连续稳定地上升。做到这一点并没有不可克服的难处。问题是要切切实实地把一切应当做的工作都做到家。
    工作怎么才叫做到家？定一个公式是困难的，但是有几条，是一定要做到的。
    第一条叫做信心足够，充满着蓬蓬勃勃无产阶级事业家发愤图强的革命精神。这一条至关紧要，它好比一个强大的动力，推动着我们奋勇前进。
    但是，任何革命事业的发展，都会遇到这样那样的一些问题（矛盾、困难、不利因素等等）。你要想让生产连续稳定上升，就可能有一系列的问题来找你。一个有经验的企业领导者，不是等问题来找人，而是事先把可能出现的各种问题尽可能统统想到。（想到想不到，又决定于你是不是熟悉生产实际，是不是经过了周密的调查研究）
    干劲十足，又把问题想够，这就主动了。这是第二条。
    但是，任何一个问题都不会自动解决的。吃一口饭要张一次嘴，解决一个问题要有一个措施。措施不仅要具体，而且要加够。为什么？因为人总归不是神仙，不能预见到生产过程中一切可能发生的问题。因为，有些问题，不到一定时候，是不会暴露出来的。因此，就要采取万全之计。这就是把措施加够，加到十分指标，十二分措施。这样，不管出现什么新问题，都不会措手不及，都有对付的办法。这是第三条。重庆钢铁公司转炉一厂的领导方法，最突出的一点就在这里。
    最近，我们都在学习《毛泽东选集》第四卷。在有关解放战争的各篇中，我们得到什么有益的教诲呢？要藐视鄙视一切反动派。不管反动派如何貌似强大，都是可以打败的。但是，在和敌人作斗争时，却要看到一个一个的具体困难。困难是可以克服的，但要作切实的准备，绝不打无把握之仗。每战必集中绝对优势兵力（两倍、三倍、四倍、有时甚至是五倍或六倍于敌之兵力），四面包围敌人，力求全歼，不使漏网。
    我们就是在毛主席这种光辉的战略思想指引下，赢得了革命战争胜利的。
    生产是另一种战斗。生产中的“敌人”，就是那些矛盾，困难和不利因素。对于这些“敌人”，在整体上，也要藐视它们，抱必胜的信念。但在每一个具体问题上，不仅不可轻视它们，而且要对它们有足够的估计。并且也要不打无把握的仗，采取足够的措施去战胜它们。
    重钢转炉一厂的同志们，就是运用了这种稳扎稳打的工作方法，取得生产连续稳定上升的成果的。他们把生产中可能出现的问题，都一一想够，一一采取了措施。不但在生产关键和主要工种上采取了比较充分的措施，而且对那些不大引人注意的“小地方”（次要工种、辅助部门、小的环节），也采取了周密的措施。对一些重要环节，不但设下一道防线，而且设下几道防线。这样就造成优势力量，打有把握的仗，保证取得全胜。
    在战争中，占领城市，是歼灭敌人有生力量的结果。在生产中，生产连续稳定上升，是采取各种措施，不断解决一个个具体问题的结果。
    这种领导方法的特点是什么？是无产阶级的革命胆略和科学精神、求实态度的结合。
    现在离年底只有二十多天了，我们要把措施加得足足的，特别是安全生产，防寒防冻防火，设备维修，安排好工人生活等等，都设下一道道防线。造成几倍优于“敌人”的力量。每一样事情都要深入检查，是否办得切切实实，比如安全生产，是不是一个工序一个工序地检查了；防寒防冻的物资是不是准备齐全了；工人生活特别是那些井下工人、炉前工和火车司机等的生活是不是安排得妥妥贴贴了。在加措施的时候，对于那些“小问题”也丝毫不能忽视。比如，矿工用的矿灯，是不是够用，这是一个“小问题”，但如果不注意，就会影响到采煤和掘进效率。这些问题，都一个一个地妥善解决了，功夫到了家，提前和超额完成今年以钢为纲的工业生产计划就更有把握了。
