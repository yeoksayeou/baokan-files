Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 12th: The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement today regarding the situation in the Congo, angrily condemning the United States imperialists for their blatant and unreasonable acts of aggression against the Congo under the guise of the United Nations. It firmly asserted that the barbaric persecution of Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba and other Congolese leaders must be stopped immediately, they must be released immediately, and the activities of the legitimate government and parliament of the Republic of the Congo must be restored immediately.

The statement said that due to the United States imperialists' blatant interference and aggression, the national independence of the Congolese people is facing a serious crisis. The United States imperialists and their accomplices recently instigated their lackey, the Mobutu clique, to illegally arrest Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba and other leaders and patriots, subjecting them to barbaric persecution. This has completely prohibited the activities of the legitimate government of the Republic of the Congo, which enjoys the absolute support of the masses of the people. This is the result of a sinister conspiracy that the United States imperialists have stubbornly pursued since the Republic of the Congo declared its independence, in order to subvert the legitimate Lumumba government and completely turn the Congo into its colony.

The statement said that the United States imperialists, through their servant, UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, are realizing their aggressive aims, continuing to shield the Belgian colonialists, manipulating the "United Nations Command," continuing to paralyze the legitimate Lumumba government, and depriving the Republic of the Congo, led by Lumumba, of its legitimate representation within the United Nations.

The statement said that today, the United States imperialists are not only in the Congo, but also everywhere in the world, opposing national independence and freedom, and carrying out sinister acts of aggression that disrupt peace and security. All these facts clearly prove that United States imperialism is the mastermind of modern colonialism, the fortress of world reactionary forces, and the common enemy of the people of the world. As historical experience has proven, imperialist aggressors will not leave on their own accord. For national independence and freedom, the people of all countries can only achieve final victory by uniting firmly and launching a decisive struggle against them.

The statement expressed the Korean people's firm support for and complete sympathy with the just struggle of the Congolese people. The statement said that the Korean people, together with the Congolese people and the people of all other countries fighting against imperialist aggression, will more resolutely struggle against the common enemy – United States imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 9th: The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement today on the current situation in the Congo, saying, "The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people strongly condemn the imperialist plot to invade the Congo and resolutely demand that imperialism must stop stealing the name of the United Nations to interfere in and undermine the independence of the Congo. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people demand the restoration of the freedom of Prime Minister Lumumba and other Congolese leaders, demand the taking of measures to immediately stop the atrocities of the Mobutu clique, the imperialist lackey, and demand the restoration of the legitimate status and normal activities of the Lumumba government and the Parliament of the Republic of the Congo."

The statement pointed out, "The recent events in the Congo have shown us that imperialism clings tightly to its colonies and is unwilling to give up its interests there. They collude with each other, take all means to carry out sabotage and divisive activities, help their lackeys create rebellions, and use the name of the United Nations to realize their aggressive conspiracies in the Congo. All of this constitutes a serious crisis, which not only threatens the independence and security of the Republic of the Congo, but also threatens the independence of other African countries. At the same time, this is also a crisis for peace in Africa and the world."

The statement said, "As an Asian country that is fighting against United States imperialist interference in its own country, the Vietnamese people deeply understand the Congolese people, sympathize with and support the Congolese people's struggle for national independence and territorial integrity, and are willing to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Congolese people and the African people to jointly oppose any imperialist aggressive conspiracy."

    朝鲜外务省和越南外交部就刚果局势发表声明
    谴责帝国主义利用联合国侵略刚果
    要求立即释放卢蒙巴并恢复刚果合法政府的活动
    据新华社平壤12日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省今天就刚果局势发表一项声明，愤怒地谴责美帝国主义在联合国的幌子下对刚果的粗暴无理的侵略行为，并坚决主张立即停止对刚果总理卢蒙巴和刚果其他领导人的野蛮迫害，立即释放他们，立即恢复刚果共和国的合法政府和议会的活动。
    声明说，由于美帝国主义的粗暴干涉和侵略，刚果人民的民族独立面临着严重危机。美帝国主义者及其共谋者最近唆使其走狗蒙博托集团，非法逮捕刚果共和国合法政府总理卢蒙巴及其他领导人和爱国人士，对他们进行野蛮的迫害，使受到人民群众绝对支持的刚果共和国合法政府的活动遭到完全禁止。这是美帝国主义从刚果共和国宣布独立时就开始的、为颠复合法的卢蒙巴政府和把刚果完全变成它的殖民地而顽固推行的凶恶阴谋的结果。
    声明说，美帝国主义通过它的奴仆——联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德来实现自己的侵略目的，继续庇护比利时殖民主义者，操纵“联合国军司令部”，继续瘫痪卢蒙巴合法政府，并且在联合国内剥夺了以卢蒙巴为首的刚果共和国的合法的代表权。
    声明说，今天，美帝国主义者不仅在刚果，而且在世界到处反对民族独立和自由，进行扰乱和平和安全的凶恶的侵略。这一切事实清楚地证明，美帝国主义是现代殖民主义的元凶、世界反动势力的堡垒、全世界人民的共同的敌人。正如历史经验所证实的一样，帝国主义侵略者是不会自己滚开的。为了民族独立和自由，各国人民只有牢固地团结起来，对它们展开决定性的斗争，才能取得最后的胜利。
    声明表示朝鲜人民坚决支持和完全同情刚果人民的正义斗争。声明说，朝鲜人民同刚果人民一起，同反对帝国主义侵略而斗争的其他所有国家的人民一起，为反对共同的敌人——美帝国主义将更加坚决地进行斗争。
    据新华社河内9日电　越南民主共和国外交部今天就刚果当前局势发表的声明说，“越南民主共和国政府和越南人民严厉谴责帝国主义侵略刚果的阴谋，坚决要求帝国主义必须停止盗用联合国的名义来干涉和破坏刚果的独立。越南民主共和国政府和越南人民要求恢复卢蒙巴总理和刚果其他领导人的自由，要求采取措施立即制止帝国主义走狗蒙博托集团的暴行，要求恢复卢蒙巴政府和刚果共和国议会的合法地位和正常活动。”
    声明指出，“最近刚果的事件使我们看到，帝国主义紧紧抓住殖民地而不肯放弃它们在那里的利益。它们互相勾结，采取一切手段来进行破坏、分裂活动，帮助它们的走狗制造叛乱，利用联合国名义来实现它们在刚果的侵略阴谋。所有这一切，构成了严重危机，这不仅威胁着刚果共和国的独立和安全，而且也威胁着非洲其他国家的独立。同时，这也是非洲和世界和平的一个危机。”
    声明说，“作为一个正在为反对美帝国主义干涉自己国家而斗争的亚洲国家，越南人民深刻地理解刚果人民，同情并支持刚果人民正在为争取民族独立和领土完整而进行的斗争，愿同刚果人民和非洲人民一起，肩并肩地共同反对帝国主义的任何侵略阴谋。”（附图片）
