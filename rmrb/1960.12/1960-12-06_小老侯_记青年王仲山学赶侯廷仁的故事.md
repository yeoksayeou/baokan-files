	"Little Old Hou"
	——A Story of Young Wang Zhongshan Learning from Hou Tingren
	By Our Correspondent Li Jinkai

Talking with the workers of the Zhuxi Comprehensive Farm in Hubei, Wang Zhongshan, who is called "Little Hou Tingren," is simply a legendary figure. It was he who trained the cattle to be so disciplined. As long as he whistles and shouts, "Cows in front, steers in the back!" dozens of cattle will follow the order in a disciplined manner. It was he who, not long ago, heard that a leopard was harassing the sheep, immediately picked up a rifle and rushed forward, straight to within twenty or thirty feet of the leopard, and with one shot, knocked down this eight-foot-long spotted leopard. The skinned leopard pelt is still kept in the farm's headquarters. It is also he, only nineteen years old this year, who has insisted on developing the Dahuayuan Production Team from three people to ninety-six people in the deep mountains and old forests near Shaanxi, and planted 1,800 mu of grain, 500 mu of sugar beets, and more than 200 mu of medicinal herbs, and established livestock farms, pig farms, and wineries, etc., accumulating 150,000 to 160,000 yuan of wealth for the country. Speaking of him, Hou Tingren, the nationally famous mountain management hero, said with a smile: "This kid Zhongshan is really reliable when he does things! With him, I can rest assured about this Dahuayuan team."

However, four years ago, when Wang Zhongshan heard the story of Hou Tingren's thrifty farm management and came to the farm with a small bundle, wanting to learn from Hou Tingren, Hou Tingren saw that he was so young and only as tall as a carrying pole, and shook his head, saying: "You are young, and the work in the farm is heavy, either carrying or loading. You can't do it. Go back quickly, and come back when you grow up." No matter how he expressed his determination, he was not accepted. Who knew that he went home for a trip, and then came back to the farm, saying that he would not leave. Hou Tingren had no choice but to assign him to the livestock team to take care of a sheep and a cow. When he went up the mountain, Lao Hou repeatedly instructed: "Our farm emphasizes thrift in everything we do. When grazing cattle, you must not only feed the cattle well, but also learn to treat their diseases. Without spending money, use local methods. Comrade Liu Renrui, the veterinarian of the livestock team, is a Party member, and you should learn more from him." Little Wang happily replied: "Farm Manager Hou, don't worry, I will do whatever you tell me to do."

After a while, Little Wang asked to graze more cattle. With more cattle, there were more troubles: the cows were driven away, the bulls ran away; either this cow ate corn, or that cow trampled on crops. To chase a cow, sometimes he had to run across several mountains. In a few months, two pairs of new pants were torn to shreds by tree branches and thorns. He himself was so anxious that he cried several times, how could he make these wild cattle listen to him? He whistled, shouted slogans, and beat the clapper, but nothing worked. Hou Tingren told him: "Cattle are like people, you have to carefully understand their temper, be considerate of them, and care for them, and they will listen to you." That's right, from then on, he carefully observed, and he knew clearly which cow had a fierce temper and which cow liked to eat "mountain grass", and the cattle were easier to graze. One day, he suddenly thought, don't cows like to eat salty things? He immediately made some salt water and sprayed it on the grass with a sprayer, and the cows all gathered around to eat, and followed his sprayer. Later, as long as the sprayer made a "hissing" sound, even if it was empty, the cattle would follow him, very obediently. Then, he used whistle sounds to train the cattle. As soon as he blew the whistle, the cattle would gather together. In this way, he grazed thirty cows by himself, and commanded them freely.

While learning to graze, Little Wang brought back some medicinal herbs every time he went up the mountain and asked the veterinarian Comrade Liu Renrui for advice: What is this medicine, what can it cure? He wrote it down bit by bit in his notebook and remembered it in his heart. When treating cattle, Little Wang did not let go of any opportunity. While helping Lao Liu, he kept asking questions. Seeing Little Wang's eagerness to learn, Lao Liu unreservedly passed on all the types of cattle diseases, prevention, and treatment methods to Little Wang, and personally taught him how to operate. In less than a year, Little Wang was able to handle the treatment methods for cattle diseases such as wheezing, bloating, and blood sausage, including acupuncture and medicine infusion. In the autumn, the livestock team's cattle became ill. Little Wang proposed a suggestion to the team: "Separate the healthy cattle from the sick cattle for feeding," indicating that he was willing to be responsible for feeding the sick cattle. When Little Wang moved his bedding to the cowshed and lived with the twelve sick cattle, every day before dawn, he drove the cattle up the mountain to eat dew grass, and at the same time, he took the time to dig medicine and pull cow grass. In the evening, he chopped the grass, cooked it until it was rotten, mixed in some feed, and served them one by one. To treat the sick cattle, Little Wang worked diligently, day and night, taking care of the cattle, without any complaints. In less than two or three months, the twelve sick cattle had recovered their health and grown fat and strong. Little Wang was rated as a first-class work model on the entire farm.

What made Little Wang most anxious was that after the farm put forward the call to "form small teams of three and large teams of five" to develop towards Dagaoshan, Yin Xugang and the others all took two or three people, carried a load of buckets, a pot, and a few hoes and machetes into the mountains, and successively opened up Fangjiaping, Qishuping, Yunwushan... many bases. What was he to do? He thought: "I'll drive twenty cows out and open up a new pasture." After this suggestion was approved by the leadership, he drove the cattle out alone. Before leaving, Hou Tingren held Little Wang's hand tightly and repeatedly instructed: "You are a young kid, alone outside, it's not like being on the farm. Just relying on enthusiasm is not enough, you have to have a plan. Remember, as long as you rely closely on the Party and rely on the masses, you can overcome any difficulties." Little Wang was so excited that he didn't know how to answer. After a long time, he said: "Farm Manager Hou, I have remembered everything you said, and I promise to do things according to your instructions..."

In this deep mountain and old forest, where people are scarce, where should he settle down? Little Wang himself was not sure. The first night, he and twenty cows spent the night in the open air in the mountains. The next day, he found Xu Ziyang, the Party branch secretary of the farm who was making steel nearby, and reported to him. Secretary Xu then sent a young man named Li Changwu to help him and gave Little Wang a detailed explanation. The two of them drove the cattle into a large mountain called Yangou. There was plenty of water and grass here, and the pasture was good, but there was only one household. He contacted the hostess of this household, borrowed two thatched houses, and spent more than three months here. At this time, it was already October, when the leaves fell and the grass withered, and the cold winter was approaching day by day. What would happen to this group of cattle in the face of howling winds and falling snow? Little Wang discussed with Little Li that they had to quickly find grass. However, at this time, Li Changwu slipped away because he couldn't stand the hardship. However, this did not shake Little Wang's determination. He thought: "Farm Manager Hou can run a farm by himself, why can't I learn from Farm Manager Hou and run a livestock farm well? I must persevere to the end!"

Little Wang drove the cattle, walked and grazed across the mountains, and lived a nomadic life for a few days. Later, he heard that the Wu'ai Production Team in a large mountain ditch had a lot of rice straw, so he immediately came to Wu'ai and negotiated with the team to supply him with more than 20,000 catties of rice straw, but he had to pay 300 yuan. Little Wang quickly rushed back to the farm to get the money. Hou Tingren smiled and said: "Silly boy! Have you forgotten what I told you when you entered the farm? Socialism is built by people, not bought with money. You have twenty cows, which is more capital than anyone else, do you still need money? Can't you think of a way to use cattle to raise cattle?" Little Wang was immediately ashamed and blushed, and quickly rushed back to Wu'ai. On the way, he kept thinking about the method of "using cattle to raise cattle." He remembered that the Wu'ai team had more land and fewer cattle, and the livestock farm's cattle were idle. Could he use the cattle to plow the fields for the Wu'ai team to offset the price of the straw? And the manure of twenty cows is also valuable! He discussed with the Wu'ai team that the price of straw was offset by cattle labor and cattle manure, and he did not spend a penny to make the cattle spend the winter fully.

While staying in the Wu'ai team, Little Wang and his newly recruited partner Li Xiangci also used their spare time to go up the mountain to cut kudzu vines and wild hemp, bleached them with cow dung, and trial-produced more than a dozen catties of wild fiber, which they exchanged for a small piglet to raise.

After the spring, the Wu'ai team planted crops, which was not suitable for grazing. Little Wang traveled more than a hundred miles through the deep mountains and old forests to find a large mountain bordering Shaanxi Province - Dahuayuan. Here, the mountain ridges were spacious, surrounded by a dark forest of old trees, the soil on the mountain was so fertile that you could squeeze oil out with one step, and clear water flowed all year round in the mountain ditches. He couldn't help but say repeatedly: "This place is too good! Too good! I have found a 'Mountain of Treasures'."

In March, the land below the mountain was full of spring, and it was still snowing on the mountain. Little Wang led two young people, drove the cattle, and carried the piglet, and climbed up Dahuayuan along the steep and narrow sheep intestines trail. They scraped away more than a foot of snow here, opened up fertile land, planted corn, planted Codonopsis pilosula, Scrophularia ningpoensis, and Coptis chinensis seedlings.... Here, while they were rushing to open up wasteland and build farms, they also spared labor to help the Xinhua Production Team at the foot of the mountain with rushing to harvest and plant. When Little Wang learned to treat diseases from the veterinarian Liu Renrui in the past, he also learned to treat common diseases such as headaches and colds. When the commune members became ill, he also rushed to help treat them, and sometimes groped for dozens of miles of night road to treat the commune members, and the commune members were very touched. In this way, sometimes when Little Wang and the others lacked seeds and farm tools in production, the cadres of the Xinhua team would help them solve them, and the two sides were as close as a family. Wang Zhongshan and his team, in cooperation with the local people, worked hard for more than ten months, and built Dahuayuan, which is more than two thousand meters above sea level, into a "Mountain of Treasures" with all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline industries. Now, the entire team has a total of ninety-six people (fifty-eight laborers), planting corn, sugar beets, and precious medicinal materials such as Codonopsis pilosula, Scrophularia ningpoensis, and Angelica sinensis, planted eight sheds of Coptis chinensis, established processing plants for winemaking, medicinal materials, etc., and at the same time developed from one piglet to more than seventy, which is like a small comprehensive farm. Not long ago, in order to develop sugar beet production, they wanted to build a sugar factory. Deputy Farm Manager Xu Peixi made a design, in addition to the 3,000 yuan for purchasing machinery, he also needed 12,000 yuan for construction costs. Little Wang thought for a long time and said: "Including the machinery, we can only spend a maximum of 8,000 yuan." The deputy farm manager disagreed and went to Farm Manager Hou Tingren. Hou Tingren calculated with his fingers and said: "8,000 yuan can build two." The deputy farm manager said: "I can't do it." Little Wang immediately said: "I will do it." He returned to the team and mobilized the masses to go up the mountain to cut timber themselves, and found two people to learn how to burn bricks and tiles on the spot. Without spending much money, he prepared all the materials. As a result, the construction cost of 1,000 yuan was only used for 945 yuan to build nine factory buildings and five workers' dormitories. He also asked Hou Tingren for approval to use the remaining 55 yuan to build two more workers' dormitories. Hou Tingren was so happy that he told everyone he met: "This 'Little Old Hou' is going to surpass me, the big Old Hou."

However, Little Wang was not satisfied. He led another group of young men and women to Dongbiaohu, more than twenty miles away from Dahuayuan, to open up a new base. Now, Dongbiaohu not only has a surplus of grain for self-sufficiency, but also cut down three Coptis chinensis sheds and planted more than fifty mu of medicinal materials, and is striving to build a second "Dahuayuan."

    “小老侯”
    ——记青年王仲山学赶侯廷仁的故事
    本报记者　李金锴
    听湖北竹溪综合农场的工人们谈起来，被人叫做“小侯廷仁”的王仲山简直是个传奇式的人物。就是他，将牛群训练得那么有纪律，他只要吹声哨子，喊一句：“母牛在前，犍子在后！”几十头牛就循规蹈矩地按命令走了过来。就是他，前不久听说豹子骚扰羊群来了，他立时提了枝步枪赶上前去，直赶到离豹子只两三丈远，一枪，就将这只八尺大斑豹掀倒了。剥下来的豹皮至今还保存在农场场部里。也就是他，今年才十九岁，便坚持在邻近陕西的深山老林里，使大花园生产队由三人发展到九十六人，并且种了一千八百亩粮食、五百亩甜菜、二百多亩药材，办起了畜牧场、养猪场和酿酒厂等等，为国家积累了十五六万元的财富。一提起他，全国著名的治山英雄侯廷仁便眼笑眉开地说：“仲山这娃子，做起事来真是靠得住！　有了他，我对大花园这个队就放心了。”
    但是，四年前，王仲山听了侯廷仁勤俭办场的故事，挂个小衣包来投农场，向侯廷仁学习的时候，侯廷仁见他小小的年纪只长得跟扁担一般高，就摇头说：“你年纪小，场里的活路重，不是挑就是驮，你干不了。快回去，长大了再来。”无论他怎样表示自己的决心，都不收他。谁知他回家转了一趟，又来场里了，说什么也不肯走。侯廷仁只好分配他去畜牧队看一只羊和一头牛。临上山时，老侯一再嘱咐：“我们这个农场，搞什么都讲勤俭。放牛，不光要把牛喂好，还要学会给牛治病。不花钱，用土法治。畜牧队的兽医刘任瑞同志，是个党员，要多向他学习。”小王乐呼呼地回答说：“侯场长，你放心，叫我干啥我就干啥。”
    过些日子，小王要求多放几头牛。牛增多，可就麻烦多了：赶了母牛，跑了公牛；不是这头牛吃了苞谷，就是那头牛踩了庄稼。为了撵一头牛，有时一跑就是几架山。几个月，两条新裤子就被树枒、荆棘挂得稀烂。他自己急得哭了几回，怎么才能叫这些野性的牛听话呀？他吹口哨，打号子，敲梆子，都不行。侯廷仁跟他讲：“牛跟人一样，你要细心了解它的脾气，体贴它，关心它，它才听你的话。”对呀，他从此细心观察，对哪条牛性子烈，哪条牛爱吃“上山草”，都弄的一清二楚，牛也就好放牧了。有一天，他忽然想起，牛不是爱吃有咸味的东西吗？他马上弄些盐水用喷雾器喷在草上，牛都围拢来吃，并且跟着他的喷雾器转。以后，只要喷雾器“嘶嘶”响，哪怕是空响呢，牛群都跟了过来，很听指挥。接着，他又用哨音训练牛，一吹哨子，牛群就集拢来。这样，他一人放牧三十来头牛，指挥自如。
    在学习放牧的同时，小王每次上山都要扯些药草回来，向兽医刘任瑞同志请教：这是什么药，能治什么病？一点一滴地写到本子上，记在心里。在给牛治病的时候，小王更不放松机会，一面给老刘帮忙，一面不住的问这问那。老刘见小王的学习心切，就毫无保留地把牛的病症种类、预防和治疗方法，全部传给小王，并亲手教他实际操作。不到一年时间，有关牛的气喘、臌肚子、血灌肠等病症的扎针、灌药等治法，小王都能一手拿下来。秋天，畜牧队的牛闹病，小王向队里提了个“好牛、病牛分开喂养”的建议，表示自己愿意负责喂养病牛。当小王把铺盖搬到牛棚，和十二头病牛住在一起时，每天天朦朦亮，他就把牛赶上山吃露水草，同时抽空挖药、扯牛草。晚上，他把铡碎的草，煮烂掺些饲料，一头一头的服侍着。为治病牛，小王勤勤恳恳，夜以继日地看护牛，没有一点怨言。不到两、三个月的工夫，这十二头病牛都恢复了健康，长得膘壮肉肥。小王被评为全场的甲等工作模范。
    最使小王焦急的事，是在农场提出了“三人一小队，五人一大队”向大高山发展的号召之后，尹绪刚他们都带着三两人，挑一担桶、一口锅，带几把锄头、弯刀进山去了，先后开辟出了方家坪、漆树坪、云雾山……好些基地，他怎么办呢？他想：“自己赶二十头牛出去，开辟一个新的牧场。”这个意见经领导批准后，他就独自赶着牛出去了。临行时，侯廷仁紧握着小王的手，一再嘱咐道：“你这个年轻轻的娃子，一个人单枪匹马的在外面，比不得在农场里，光凭干劲不行，还得要有计划。切记着，到那里只要紧紧依靠党、依靠群众，有再大的困难也会克服。”小王心里激动得不知怎样回答，好大一会才说：“侯场长，你说的话我全都记住了，保证按你的话办事……。”
    在这人迹稀罕的深山老林里，到哪儿去安身呢？小王自己也没个准。头一天的晚上，他和二十头牛在山中的露天地熬过了一夜。第二天，他找到了在附近大办钢铁的农场党支部书记徐子扬，向他作了汇报，徐书记当时派了个小伙子李长武给他作帮手，并向小王细细地作了一番交代。他们两人把牛群赶进了一个叫堰沟的大山里。这里水草多、放场好，但就只一户人家。他同这户人家的女主人接洽好，借了两间草房，在这里过了三个多月。这时，已是叶落草枯的十月天气，寒冷的冬天一天天的逼近着。遇到吼风落雪的天气，这群牛可怎么办？小王同小李商量，得赶紧想法子找草去。偏偏这时李长武因为受不得苦溜走了。不过，这并没有动摇小王的决心，他想：“侯场长一个人能办起农场，我为啥不能学侯场长办好畜牧场？一定要坚持到底”！
    小王一人赶着牛群，翻山越岭的边走边放，过了几天游牧生活。后来，他听到在一个大山冲里的五爱生产队稻草很多，他马上来到五爱，同这个队商量，由队里供给他两万多斤稻草，但是得付出三百元钱。小王连忙赶回农场取钱，侯廷仁笑着说：“傻娃子！你忘了进场时我咋对你讲的？社会主义是人建的，不是钱买的。你有二十头牛，比谁的本钱都大，还要钱？你不能想个办法以牛养牛吗？”小王顿时羞的耳红面赤，又连忙赶回五爱去。一路上，他不住地思索着“以牛养牛”的办法。他想起五爱队地多牛少，畜牧场的牛都是闲着的，用牛给五爱队耕田犁地，折抵草钱不行吗？还有二十头牛的粪也值钱啊！他同五爱队商量，这样用牛工、牛粪折抵了草价，没花一个钱便使群牛饱饱地过了一冬。
    留在五爱队的时候，小王和新招来的伙伴李祥慈还利用空闲时间，上山刈葛藤、野麻，用牛粪漂白，试制成了十几斤野生纤维，换回一头小猪娃来喂养。
    开春后，五爱队种上了庄稼，不适合放牧，小王又踏遍了百多里地的深山老林找到和陕西省交界的一座大山——大花园。这里山梁上地势宽敞，周围一片黑压压的老树林，山上的土质一脚能踩出油来，山沟里一年四季流着白澕澕的清水。他情不自禁地连声说：“这地方太好了！太好了！可找住‘万宝山’了。”
    3月，山下已春满大地，山上还下着大雪。小王带领了两个青年，赶着牛群，抱着猪娃，沿着又陡又窄的羊肠小道，攀上了大花园。他们就在这里扒开了尺多深的积雪，开出了肥沃的土地，种上了苞谷，栽上了党参、玄参、栽上了黄连秧子……。在这里，他们一面突击开荒建场，一面还抽出劳力帮助山下新华生产队搞抢收抢种。小王过去跟兽医刘仁瑞学治病时，还学会了医治头痛、感冒等普通病症，社员有了病，他也赶去帮助治疗，有时还摸上几十里的夜路去给社员治病，社员们很受感动。这样，有时小王他们在生产上缺种籽、少农具，新华队的干部就帮他们解决，双方之间亲如一家。王仲山他们这个队便在同当地群众协作下，艰苦奋斗了上十个月，便把一个拔海二千多米的大花园，建成了一个农、林、牧、副全面发展的“万宝山”。现在，全队共九十六人（五十八个劳力），种了苞谷、甜菜和党参、玄参、当归等贵重药材，栽了八棚黄连，建立了酿酒、药材等加工厂，同时由一个猪娃发展七十多头，俨然是一个小型的综合农场。前不久，他们为了发展甜菜生产，要建个制糖厂，副场长许培喜作了个设计，购买机器的三千元在外，还得一万二千元建筑费。小王想了半天，说：“连机器在内，最多只能花八千元。”副场长不以为然，去找场长侯廷仁，侯廷仁搬着指头算了算，说：“八千元办两个。”副场长说：“我办不了。”小王立时说：“我去办。”他回队里发动群众上山自砍木材，又找两人就地学烧砖瓦，没花什么钱，就把各项材料准备停当，结果一千元建筑费只用了九百四十五元就盖起了九间厂房和五间工人宿舍。他还请求侯廷仁批准，将剩余的五十五元用来再盖两间工人宿舍。直喜得侯廷仁见人就讲：“这‘小老侯’要超过我大老侯了。”
    但是，小王并不满足。他又带领一伙青年男女，去到离大花园二十多里的东标湖，开辟了一个新的基地。现在，东标湖除粮食自给有余外，还砍了三个黄连棚、栽了五十多亩药材，正在争取建成第二个“大花园”。
