    The Dollar Crisis Shakes the "Gold Dollar Empire"

    The United States' gold reserves have fallen below the "danger point" of $18 billion. This is a very ominous piece of bad news for the American economy, which is in the midst of a new cyclical crisis, for the United States' economic position in the capitalist world, and especially for the dollar, the symbol of the "gold dollar empire," in the capitalist world economy. It shows that the dollar crisis has surfaced.

    Since 1958, the United States' gold reserves have been flowing out continuously and rapidly. To date, in less than three years, nearly $5 billion in gold has been lost, and it is still flowing out. In the post-World War II era, the dollar, the only currency in the capitalist world that can be directly converted into gold and is treated as an international currency on par with gold, has been clearly exposed as being unusually weak with the rapid and large reduction of U.S. gold reserves, and its credibility is increasingly being lost in the minds of people in the capitalist world. The constant fluctuations in gold prices in the London gold market since August this year, and the gold rush that appeared in late October, are strong manifestations of people's distrust of the dollar. The U.S. government authorities, panicked by this trend, have repeatedly declared that they will continue to maintain the exchange rate between the dollar and gold. However, many important newspapers in Western European countries have repeatedly pointed out that the devaluation of the dollar will be "inevitable." In this case, people in the capitalist world are abandoning the dollar like discarding everything that has depreciated, exchanging it for gold, and even for the currencies of other countries.

    In fact, since the exchange rate between the dollar and gold was set at $35 per ounce of gold in 1934, the actual purchasing power of the dollar is now only about one-third of what it was before the war due to severe inflation. However, the devaluation of the dollar's actual value has not directly become the cause of shaking the dollar's foreign credit. The reason for this is that the dollar can be exchanged for gold at the rate of $35 per ounce. In the post-war years, the United States, due to its strong economic strength in the capitalist world, once held nearly two-thirds of the capitalist world's gold reserves. However, after 1958, this situation changed significantly. The United States had a balance of payments deficit since 1950. This deficit began to expand significantly in 1958. From 1951 to 1956, the average annual U.S. balance of payments deficit was $1.1 billion, but in 1958 it suddenly increased to $3.4 billion, and in 1959 it increased to $3.8 billion. In the third quarter of this year, it reached $4.3 billion calculated at an annual rate. The expansion of the balance of payments deficit has led to a large outflow of U.S. gold reserves. Now, the United States only has more than $17.9 billion in gold reserves, while foreigners hold $20.7 billion in short-term dollar claims that can be exchanged for gold from the United States. The unusual emptiness of the U.S. gold reserves cannot but greatly depreciate the credibility of the dollar.

    The dollar crisis caused by the widening international payments deficit and the outflow of gold actually reflects the deepening economic instability of U.S. imperialism after World War II. Since the war, the United States has experienced frequent economic crises, and is currently experiencing the fourth cyclical economic crisis since the war. If the first two economic crises that erupted after the war (i.e., 1948-49, 1953-54) had not yet affected the financial sector, then the sudden expansion of the U.S. balance of payments deficit and the large outflow of gold reserves in 1958 could not but be the direct consequence of the 1957-58 economic crisis. The reason is that the crisis not only shrunk U.S. exports and reduced income, but also caused the U.S. federal budget to have an unprecedentedly huge deficit of $12.5 billion due to the U.S. government's adoption of "anti-recession measures" to expand government spending and stimulate production and consumption, thereby greatly weakening the credibility of the dollar. The British "Financial Times" pointed out that the dollar's international problems began in 1958. The complete surfacing of the dollar crisis precisely appeared in the initial stage of the fourth cyclical crisis since the war, which began in February this year, and this is by no means accidental. Because the further deterioration of the U.S. economy has made both American and foreign investors lose confidence in the dollar itself and the prospects of the U.S. economy. This is bound to cause a large outflow of funds and a deterioration of the international balance of payments. Obviously, the crisis of overproduction in the United States is intertwined with the dangerous situation of the international balance of payments. This situation will greatly deepen the severity of the developing U.S. economic crisis.

    The dollar crisis is also a reflection of the imbalance in capitalist economic development and the declining economic hegemony of the United States in the capitalist world. After the war, the United States, due to its economic strength strengthened during the war, once controlled the entire capitalist world economically. It often maintained a trade surplus of $6-7 billion in foreign trade, causing Western Europe and other major capitalist countries to be trapped in a "dollar shortage" for a long time. However, after 1950, with the economic recovery and development of Western Europe and other capitalist countries, their competitiveness in foreign markets has been increasing day by day. By 1958, the "dollar shortage" in Western European countries and other major capitalist countries had turned into a dollar surplus. In addition, a large outflow of U.S. private capital has transformed Western European countries and other major capitalist countries from a situation of begging for dollars in the past to accumulating large amounts of dollars, which has formed a huge pressure on the dollar. Moreover, due to the pressure of the economic crisis, the United States has lowered bank interest rates twice this year, while at the same time, Western European countries have maintained higher interest rates in order to tighten economic activity. The instability and low interest rates of the U.S. economy in contrast have caused a large amount of short-term capital from the United States and foreigners to flow to Western Europe, thereby greatly deepening the dollar crisis.

    In addition to economic reasons, the dollar crisis also has reasons related to the U.S. imperialist policy of preparing for war and expanding aggression. A major reason for the continuous expansion of the U.S. balance of payments deficit and the outflow of gold is the United States' annual overseas military spending and so-called "foreign aid" expenditures. The total amount of these two expenditures is about $8 billion per year. This is the price paid by U.S. imperialism for pursuing a policy of war preparation and expansion of aggression. This policy of U.S. imperialism seriously threatens world peace and infringes on the sovereignty and interests of many countries, which demonstrates the madness of U.S. imperialism. On the other hand, some countries in the capitalist world, even some major capitalist countries, regard the dollars spent by the United States overseas and the so-called "aid" as one of the pillars supporting their economies, and the reactionary rule of some U.S. vassal states can hardly survive without the so-called "U.S. aid," which reflects the decline of the capitalist world and the corruption of the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression. The U.S. imperialist policy of frantic war preparation and expansion of aggression, on the one hand, arouses the increasingly high anti-American storm of people of all countries, and on the other hand, the balance of payments deficit caused by overseas military spending and the so-called "foreign aid" expenditures exposes the fragility of this policy of aggression.

    The U.S. ruling clique is greatly panicked by the serious dollar crisis, and loudly calls for "defending the dollar." To this end, U.S. President Eisenhower has issued seven emergency directives, attempting to save the dollar crisis. However, these "emergency measures" are just some superficial solutions. Eisenhower publicly announced that the United States will neither withdraw or reduce its troops stationed abroad, nor stop or limit the overseas investment of monopoly capital, but will require the United States' "allies" to make sacrifices in many aspects such as trade and military spending. Western news agencies also believe that even if these measures formulated by Eisenhower can be realized, the foreign expenditure that can be saved each year will not exceed $1 billion, which will not be of much help in making up for the ever-widening U.S. international balance of payments deficit.

    Moreover, U.S. Treasury Secretary Anderson and Deputy Secretary of State Dillon's recent mission to Western Europe has been repeatedly thwarted, indicating that the United States' various attempts to reduce the U.S. dollar spending overseas and shift the burden of the dollar crisis are not so easy to succeed. The United States' requests for assistance from West Germany, France, and Britain have been rejected, especially West Germany has resolutely and publicly rejected the request to share the cost of U.S. troops stationed there. Obviously, Washington will not give up its plans to harm others and benefit itself. These actions by the United States are bound to further deepen and surface the contradictions that already exist and are developing within the imperialist bloc. Now the entire capitalist world has been panicked by the dollar crisis. London and Tokyo and other places are worried that the United States will take measures such as reducing overseas military spending, raising tariff barriers, and restricting imports, which will harm their economies, and stock prices have plummeted for days. It is foreseeable that the dollar crisis will have serious consequences for the economy of the entire capitalist world.

    The dollar crisis is still developing. Its continued development will inevitably deepen the various difficulties faced by U.S. imperialism and make its inherent internal and external contradictions unprecedentedly acute. Things have already and will continue to prove this truth, that is: imperialism is rotting day by day, and their days are getting worse and worse.

### 美元危机震撼着“金元帝国”

    美元危机震撼着“金元帝国”
    美国的黄金储备已下降到“危险点”一百八十亿美元以下了。这对于处在一次新的周期危机中的美国经济，以及美国在资本主义世界的经济地位，特别是对于作为“金元帝国”的标志的美元在资本主义世界经济中的地位，都是一个十分不祥的恶耗。它表明，美元危机，已经表面化了。
    从1958年以来，美国的黄金储备便不断地滚滚外流，截至目前为止，在不到三年的期间内，流失了将近五十亿美元的黄金，现在还在继续流失中。在第二次世界大战后，资本主义世界唯一可以直接兑换为黄金、并与黄金同样被当作国际货币的美元，随着美国黄金储备的迅速而大量地减少，就极其明显地暴露了它的异常虚弱的实质，而在资本主义世界人们的心目中日益丧失着它的信用。今年8月以来，伦敦黄金市场上黄金价格的不断波动，以及到10月下旬出现的抢购黄金的狂潮，都是人们不相信美元的强烈表现。被这股风潮打击得惶惶不安的美国政府当局，尽管曾一再宣称，它将继续保持美元和黄金的比价，但是，许多西欧国家的重要报刊都一再指出，美元的贬值将是“不可避免的”。在这种情况下，资本主义世界的人们正像抛弃一切贬值了的东西一样，正在抛弃美元，把它换成黄金，甚至换成其他国家的货币。
    事实上，自1934年美元与黄金的比价确定为三十五美元一盎斯黄金以来，由于严重的通货膨胀，美元的实际购买力现在只等于战前的约三分之一左右。可是，美元实际价值的贬低，却一直没有直接成为动摇美元国外信用的原因。其所以这样，就是因为美元可以按三十五美元一盎斯的比价兑换为黄金。而在战后的年代中，美国由于在资本主义世界中拥有强大的经济实力，曾经保持有资本主义世界将近三分之二的黄金储备。但是，在1958年以后，这种情形发生了明显的变化。从1950年起就曾出现了美国国际收支逆差。这种逆差到1958年开始大大地扩大了。从1951年到1956年，美国国际收支逆差平均每年为十一亿美元，而1958年骤然增加为三十四亿美元，1959年更增为三十八亿美元，今年第三季度按年率计算已达四十三亿美元。国际收支逆差的扩大，引起了美国黄金储备的大量外流。现在，美国的黄金储备只有一百七十九亿多美元，而外国人持有的可以向美国兑换黄金的美元短期债权就达二百零七亿美元。美国黄金储备的异常空虚，就不能不使美元的信用大大地跌价了。
    由于国际支付逆差扩大、黄金外流而造成的美元危机，实际上是反映了在第二次世界大战以后美帝国主义经济不稳定性的加深。战后以来，美国经济危机频繁出现，目前正经历着战后第四次周期性的经济危机。如果说，在战后爆发的前两次经济危机（即1948—49，1953—54）还没有波及到金融领域的话，那末，1958年美国国际收支逆差的骤然扩大和黄金储备的大量外流，就不能不是1957—58年经济危机的直接后果。原因就是：那次危机不仅使美国出口萎缩，收入减少，而且由于美国政府采取“反衰退措施”，扩大政府开支，刺激生产和消费，使美国联邦预算出现了一百二十五亿美元的空前巨大赤字，从而大大削弱了美元的信用。英国的《金融时报》就曾指出，美元的国际性问题开始于1958年。而美元危机的完全表面化，正是出现在从今年2月开始的战后第四次周期性的初期阶段，这也决不是偶然的。因为美国经济的再度恶化，已使美国和外国的投资者无论对美元本身或美国经济的前景都失掉信心。这就必然造成大量的资金外逃和国际收支恶化。显然，美国生产过剩危机同国际收支的险恶情况已经交织在一起了。这种情况势将大大加深正在发展中的美国经济危机的严重性。
    美元危机也是资本主义经济发展不平衡，美国在资本主义世界经济霸权日益衰落的反映。战后，由于在战争期间增强起来的经济力量，美国在经济上曾经驾驭了整个资本主义世界。它在对外贸易上经常保持六、七十亿美元的出超，使西欧以及其他一些主要的资本主义国家长期陷于“美元荒”的困境中。但是，1950年以后，西欧以及其他资本主义国家随着经济的恢复和发展，在国外市场上的竞争能力已日益加强，到1958年，西欧国家和其他一些主要的资本主义国家的“美元荒”便转变为美元过剩。更加以美国私人资本的大量输出，西欧国家和其他一些主要资本主义国家遂由过去乞求美元的境况，转变为手中积存有大量的美元，这形成了对美元的巨大压力。并且，美国由于经济危机的压力，今年已两次降低银行利率，而同时，西欧各国却为了要紧缩经济活动而保持着较高的利率。美国经济相形之下的不稳定和低利率，使得美国以及外国人在美国的短期资金大量流往西欧，从而大大加深了美元危机。
    美元危机除了经济方面的原因外，也有着美帝国主义推行备战和侵略扩张政策方面的原因。造成美国收支逆差不断扩大、黄金外流的一个主要原因，是美国每年的海外军事开支和所谓“援外”支出。这两项支出的总额每年约为八十亿美元。这是美帝国主义为了推行备战政策和侵略扩张政策所付出的代价。美帝国主义的这种政策严重地威胁着世界和平，并侵害了许多国家的主权和利益，这表现了美帝国主义的疯狂性。另一方面，资本主义世界的一些国家，甚至一些资本主义的大国，都把美国在海外花费的美元和所谓“援助”作为支持它们经济的支柱之一，而美国的一些附庸国家的反动统治则没有所谓“美援”几乎就活不下去，这又反映了资本主义世界的没落和美帝国主义侵略政策的腐朽性。美帝国主义的疯狂备战和侵略扩张政策一方面激起各国人民日益高涨的反美风暴，另一方面由于海外军事开支和所谓“援外”支出所造成的国际收支逆差，又从而暴露了这种侵略政策的脆弱性。
    美国统治集团对严重的美元危机，已经大为恐慌，大声疾呼地要求“保卫美元”。为此，美国总统艾森豪威尔已发布了七点紧急指示，企图借以挽救美元危机。但是，这些“紧急措施”不过是一些舍本逐末的办法。艾森豪威尔公开宣布，美国既不撤退或减少在外国的驻军，也不停止或限制垄断资本在海外的投资，而要求美国的“盟国”在贸易和军费等许多方面作出牺牲。西方通讯社也认为，艾森豪威尔制定的这些措施即使能够实现，每年所能节省下来的对外开支也不过十亿美元，对于弥补日益扩大的美国国际收支逆差是不会有多大作用的。
    何况，美国财政部长安德逊和副国务卿狄龙最近出使西欧的到处碰壁，表明美国为减少美国在海外的美元花费和转嫁美元危机的负担的各种做法，并不是那样容易得心应手的。美国向西德、法国、英国乞求援助，都遭到了拒绝，特别是西德更是坚决而公开地拒绝了分担美国驻军费用的要求。很显然，华盛顿方面是不会就此放弃它损人利己的计划的。而美国的这些做法势必使得帝国主义集团内部本来就存在并且日益发展的矛盾更为加深和表面化。现在整个资本主义世界都已经被美元危机弄得惊慌失措，伦敦和东京等地由于担心美国将采取减少海外军事开支，提高关税壁垒、限制进口等措施，祸延它们的经济，股票价格连日暴跌。可以预料，美元危机将会对整个资本主义世界的经济产生严重的恶果。
    美元危机还在发展中，它的继续发展，必将会加深美帝国主义所面临的各种困难，使它固有的各种内外的矛盾空前尖锐化起来。事情已经并将继续证明着这个真理，那就是：帝国主义正在一天天烂下去，他们的日子是越来越不好过了。
