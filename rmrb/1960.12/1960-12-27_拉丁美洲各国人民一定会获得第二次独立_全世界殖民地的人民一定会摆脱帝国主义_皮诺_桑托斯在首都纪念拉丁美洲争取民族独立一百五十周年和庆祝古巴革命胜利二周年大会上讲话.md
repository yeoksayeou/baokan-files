Xinhua News Agency, 26th - Cuban Ambassador to China, Oscar Pino Santos, gave a speech at the capital's people from all walks of life commemorating the 150th anniversary of Latin American countries' struggle for national independence and celebrating the second anniversary of the Cuban Revolution. The full text is as follows: Mr. Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese Latin American Friendship Association, government officials of the People's Republic of China, Latin American friends, all friends:

    First of all, please allow me to thank the friends who initiated the commemoration of the 150th anniversary of Latin American countries' struggle for national independence and the celebration of the second anniversary of the Cuban Revolution in Beijing. Commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Latin American countries' struggle for national independence is meaningful, and it is even more meaningful to celebrate it together with the second anniversary of the Cuban Revolution.

    1810 actually marked the beginning of an era in which most Latin American nations gained independence over a period of fifteen years. Commemorating this festival is a good opportunity to commemorate the great martyrs and leaders who played an important role in Latin American history - Bolivar, San Martin, Morelos, Francia, etc.; it is also a good opportunity to recall the heroic sacrifices of the people who would rather die than submit under the chains of oppression of foreign powers. At the same time, it is also a good opportunity to trace back to the Latin American people opening a new period of struggle. The struggle in the early years of the last century was a struggle against Spanish colonial rule, and the struggle in this century is a struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression. The victory in the early years of the last century was the first victory to achieve independence, and the victory in this century, as our José Martí predicted, will be the second independence of Latin America - the victory of achieving independence from the oppression of American financial capitalism.

    Now, as we commemorate the second anniversary of the Cuban Revolution here, I would like to explain a few facts.

    For various reasons (now is not the time to analyze these reasons), Cuba was the last colony to get rid of Spanish rule. Decades ago, the victories of the revolutions in other Latin American countries were undoubtedly examples for the Cuban people and inspired the Cuban people to launch a struggle for independence. At the end of the nineteenth century, when other Latin American countries had become independent republics, our Andrés Island was indeed still living in the contradictions of colonialism. This contradiction was finally resolved at the beginning of this century, and Cuba gained formal independence.

    However, in this century, both Cuba and other Latin American countries have had to suffer the intrusion of neo-colonialism. This is the result of capitalism developing into the stage of imperialism. Therefore, the economic development of Latin America has been eroded, destroyed and obstructed by the forces of neo-colonialists; the land of Latin America has once again been ravaged by new foreign aggressors; the governments of Latin American countries have become governments controlled by the interests of new suzerain states. Initially, the new colonialists were several imperialist countries. In previous years and now, those new colonialists have concentrated into one, namely U.S. imperialism.

    All this shows that the Latin American people have carried out a new anti-colonial struggle in this century, namely the struggle against U.S. imperialism. According to the above, this struggle is a struggle for the second independence of Latin America.

    However, in addition to the common historical destiny, and due to several other factors, now one of the Latin American nations - the Cuban people - has achieved its second independence. That is to say, the last Latin American country to get rid of Spanish rule has now become the first country to get rid of U.S. imperialist rule. It is important to highlight this point. Why? Because new contradictions have arisen. That is, it is not the contradiction between a colony and new colonialists. Previously, the Latin American people were free and the Cuban people were oppressed. Now the Cuban people are free and the Latin American people are oppressed. Now the Cuban people have become an example, inspiring the fraternal Latin American nations. The Latin American people need to resolve their contradictions. They will definitely be able to solve them, and they will definitely solve them sooner than the American neo-colonialists expect.

    The American colonialists want to eliminate the Cuban revolution. Why? Because eliminating the Cuban revolution means eliminating the example of struggle and victory that the Latin American people admire and support.

    U.S. imperialism does not want the Latin American people to see the example of how the Cuban people overthrew the imperialist feudal tyrants.

    U.S. imperialism does not want the Latin American people to see the example of how the Cuban people eliminated large estates, expropriated the land of reactionary oligarchs, and handed it over to farmers and agricultural workers.

    U.S. imperialism does not want the Latin American people to see the example of how the Cuban people nationalized foreign monopolies.

    American colonialism does not want the Latin American people to see the example of how the Cuban people developed a policy of economic, cultural and friendly exchanges with countries all over the world.

    American colonialists do not want the Latin American people to see the example of how the Cuban people resolutely support countries fighting for independence and support peace that has been threatened by the U.S. aggressive and belligerent bloc.

    American colonialists do not want the Latin American people to see the example of how the Cuban people have formed the highest combat unity around their government and the indisputable leader, Major Fidel Castro.

    American colonialists do not want the Latin American people to see how Cuba, through its own just struggle, has won the friendship and support of people all over the world, progressive governments all over the world, especially the governments of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

    However, the American colonialists cannot stop the Latin American people from seeing this example. Nor can they stop them from inheriting this example.

    The Latin American people will surely achieve a second independence.

    The people of all colonies in the world will surely get rid of imperialism.

    The specter of war will eventually disappear from the ground.

    The friendship between the people of all countries will surely develop like mushrooms after a rain.

    Long live the Latin American people!

    Long live the people in the anti-colonial struggle!

    Long live the friendship between the people of all countries!

    Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Latin American people!

    Long live peace!

    拉丁美洲各国人民一定会获得第二次独立
    全世界殖民地的人民一定会摆脱帝国主义
    皮诺·桑托斯在首都纪念拉丁美洲争取民族独立一百五十周年和庆祝古巴革命胜利二周年大会上讲话
    新华社26日讯　古巴驻中国大使奥斯卡·皮诺·桑托斯在首都各界人民纪念拉丁美洲各国争取民族独立一百五十周年和庆祝古巴革命胜利二周年大会上的讲话，全文如下：中国拉丁美洲友好协会会长楚图南先生，中华人民共和国政府官员先生们，拉丁美洲朋友们，全体朋友们：
    首先，请允许我感谢倡议在北京纪念拉丁美洲各国争取民族独立一百五十周年和庆祝古巴革命胜利二周年的朋友们。纪念拉丁美洲各国争取民族独立一百五十周年是有意义的，联同庆祝古巴革命胜利二周年更为有意义。
    1810年实际是标志着大部分拉丁美洲民族经过十五年的时间获得独立的时代的开端。纪念这个节日是纪念对拉丁美洲历史起着重要作用的伟大烈士和领袖——博利瓦尔，圣马丁，莫瑞洛斯，弗朗西亚等的好机会；也是回忆那些在外国强国压迫的锁链下宁死不屈的人民的英勇牺牲的好机会。同时也是追溯拉丁美洲人民打开了一个新的斗争时期的好机会。上世纪初叶的斗争是反对西班牙殖民统治的斗争，这个世纪的斗争是反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争。上世纪初叶的胜利是第一次获得独立的胜利，这个世纪的胜利，正如我们的何塞·马蒂所预言的一样，将是拉丁美洲第二次独立——摆脱美国金融资本主义压迫而取得独立的胜利。
    现在，乘我们在这里纪念古巴革命胜利二周年，我想说明几个事实。
    由于种种原因（现在不是分析这些原因的时候）古巴是最后一个摆脱西班牙统治的殖民地，几十年前，拉丁美洲其他国家革命的胜利无疑的是古巴人民的榜样并鼓舞了古巴人民展开独立斗争。十九世纪末叶，当拉丁美洲其他国家已成为独立的共和国的时候，我们的安德列斯岛的确仍生活在殖民地的矛盾中。这个矛盾终于在本世纪初解决了，古巴得到了形式的独立。
    但是，在本世纪，无论是古巴还是拉丁美洲其他国家都不得不遭受新殖民主义的侵入。这是资本主义发展到帝国主义阶段的结果。因此，拉丁美洲经济发展受到了新殖民者的势力的侵蚀、破坏和阻挠；拉丁美洲的土地又一次遭到新的外国侵略者的凌辱；拉丁美洲国家的政府成为受新的宗主国利益控制的政府。最初，新的殖民者是几个帝国主义国家。前几年和现在，那些新殖民者已集中为一个，即美帝国主义。
    这一切说明了，拉丁美洲人民在本世纪进行了一个新的反殖民的斗争，即反对美帝国主义的斗争。根据上面所指出的这个斗争是争取拉丁美洲第二次独立的斗争。
    但是，除了共同的历史命运之外，还由于其他几个因素，现在拉丁美洲的一个民族——古巴人民已经取得了第二次的独立。这就是说，最后一个摆脱西班牙统治的拉丁美洲国家，现在已成为第一个摆脱美帝国主义统治的国家。突出这一点是重要的。为什么？因为新的矛盾已产生了。那就是，不是殖民地的共和国与新的殖民者的矛盾。以前拉丁美洲人民是自由的，古巴人民是受压迫的。现在古巴人民是自由的，拉丁美洲人民是受压迫的。现在古巴人民成了榜样，鼓舞着拉丁美洲兄弟民族。拉丁美洲人民需要解决他们的矛盾。他们一定能够解决，一定会在美国新殖民者所料想的时间以前解决。
    美国殖民者想消灭古巴革命。为什么？因为消灭古巴革命，就是消灭拉丁美洲人民钦佩和支持的斗争和胜利的榜样。
    美帝国主义不愿意拉丁美洲人民看到古巴人民如何打倒帝国主义封建暴君的榜样。
    美帝国主义不愿意拉丁美洲人民看到古巴人民如何消灭大地产，如何剥夺反动寡头的土地交给农民和农业工人的榜样。
    美帝国主义不愿意拉丁美洲人民看到古巴人民如何把外国垄断企业收归国有的榜样。
    美国殖民主义不愿意拉丁美洲人民看到古巴人民如何发展同全世界各国的经济，文化和友好往来的政策的榜样。
    美国殖民者不愿意拉丁美洲人民看到古巴人民如何坚决支持争取独立的国家，支持已受到美国好战侵略集团威胁的和平的榜样。
    美国殖民者不愿意拉丁美洲人民看到古巴人民如何在他们的政府和无可争辩的领袖菲德尔·卡斯特罗少校的周围结成了最高战斗性的团结的榜样。
    美国殖民者不愿意拉丁美洲人民看到古巴如何通过他们自己的正义斗争赢得了全世界各国人民，全世界进步政府，特别是以苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和中华人民共和国为首的社会主义阵营各国政府的友谊和支援。
    但是，美国殖民者是阻挡不了拉丁美洲人民看到这个榜样的。也阻挡不了他们继承这个榜样的。
    拉丁美洲人民一定会获得第二次独立。
    全世界殖民地的人民一定会摆脱帝国主义。
    战争的幽灵终会在地面上消失。
    各国人民的友谊一定会像雨后春笋般地发展。
    拉丁美洲人民万岁！
    反殖民主义斗争的人民万岁！
    各国人民的友谊万岁！
    中国和拉丁美洲人民的友谊万岁！
    和平万岁！
