    Adenauer attempts to portray himself as a "fighter against colonialism." In an article published in the "Bulletin" of the Bonn Press Office on December 21st, he put forward the tasks of the "free world," particularly the Bonn government, in 1961, one of which is to "enable the people of young Asian and African countries to build their countries in freedom and achieve their rightful place in political and economic independence."
    "Freedom" and "independence" again—Adenauer's words sound very nice. Unfortunately, before these fine words even left his mouth, he had already been slapped hard in the face. Just one day before his article was published, the ambassadors of Arab countries to West Germany accused the Bonn government of supporting France's colonial war in Algeria. Obviously, having more than 30,000 West German mercenaries participate in the French Foreign Legion to massacre the Algerian people cannot be said to be for the purpose of enabling the people of Asia and Africa to "build their own countries in freedom." Providing 3 billion marks in aid to France to maintain its colonial rule in Algeria cannot be said to be for the purpose of enabling the people of Asia and Africa to "achieve their rightful place in political and economic independence." On the contrary, from these activities, one can smell a strong colonialist odor—the Bonn government supports its French partners, and West German monopoly capital can also share a piece of the pie in the plunder of Algeria.
    After stroking his slapped face, Adenauer may still try to argue, using the Bonn government's so-called "aid" to underdeveloped countries as evidence of his concern for Asian and African countries. Indeed, the Bonn government has decided to use 4 billion marks annually as "development assistance" to underdeveloped countries. But this fact does not add any glory to Adenauer. West German Vice-Chancellor and Minister of Economics Erhard once stated that West Germany's foreign "aid" and investment should "go to those countries with sufficient labor," and its purpose is to achieve "the greatest economic effect." To put it bluntly, it is to obtain the greatest profit by exploiting cheap labor. What else is this if not colonialist exploitation?
    An old proverb says it well: "If the fox proclaims himself a vegetarian, the hen must be extra careful!" Because, when the fox claims to be a vegetarian, although his mouth is empty, he wants to catch a hen to satisfy his appetite. Similarly, when Adenauer expresses "concern" for the people of Asia and Africa, his intentions are also very clear.

### 自称吃素的阿登纳

    自称吃素的阿登纳
    阿登纳企图把自己装扮成一个“反殖民主义的战士”。他在十二月二十一日波恩新闻局出版的“公报”上发表文章提出了“自由世界”、特别是波恩政府在一九六一年的任务，其中之一就是“使亚非年青国家的人民能够在自由当中建设他们的国家并且在政治和经济的独立中取得应有的位置”。
    又是“自由”、又是“独立”，阿登纳讲得是很动听的。可惜，他这些漂亮话还没出口，脸上已经狠狠挨了一巴掌。就在他的文章发表的前一天，阿拉伯国家驻西德的使节对波恩政府支持法国在阿尔及利亚进行殖民战争的行为提出指责。显然，让三万多名西德雇佣兵参加法国的外籍军团来屠杀阿尔及利亚人民，决说不上是为了使亚非人民“能够在自由当中建设自己的国家”。把三十亿马克的援助提供给法国用来维持在阿尔及利亚的殖民统治，也决说不上是为了使亚非人民“在政治和经济的独立中取得应有的位置”。恰恰相反，从这些勾当里，人们可以闻到强烈的殖民主义气息——波恩政府支持法国伙计，而西德垄断资本在对阿尔及利亚的掠夺中也就可以分享一杯羹。
    阿登纳在抚摸挨了巴掌的脸庞之后，也许还会强自辩解，用波恩政府对不发达国家的所谓“援助”来作为自己关心亚非国家的证据。的确，波恩政府已经决定今后每年要用四十亿马克作为对不发达国家的“开发援助”。但这件事实也并不能使阿登纳增光。波恩政府副总理兼经济部长艾哈德就曾经表示，西德的对外“援助”和投资要“走向那些有足够劳动力的国家”，而其目的在于取得“经济上的最大效果”。说得明白一点，也就是要用榨取廉价劳动力的办法来取得最大的利润。这不是殖民主义剥削又是什么？
    有一句古老的谚语说得好：“狐狸如果自称吃素，母鸡就要格外小心！”因为，狐狸在自称吃素的时候，虽然嘴里是空着的，但心里却想要抓一只母鸡来大饱口腹。同样，阿登纳在表示“关心”亚非人民的时候，他安的什么心，也是一清二楚的。
