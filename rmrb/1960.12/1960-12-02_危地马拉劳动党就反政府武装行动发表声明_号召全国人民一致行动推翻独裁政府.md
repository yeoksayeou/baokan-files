Xinhua News Agency, Guatemala City, December 1st: The Political Committee of the Central Committee of the Guatemalan Labor Party (Communist Party) recently issued a statement on the anti-government armed actions launched by the military. The statement calls on the people nationwide to unite, establish an anti-dictatorial patriotic front, and fight against repression, eliminate U.S. interference, overthrow the dictatorial rule, cancel the obligation to use Guatemala as a base for aggression against Cuba, and establish a truly democratic and patriotic government.

The statement said that the anti-democratic policies of the Ydígoras government and its actions of surrendering territory and national sovereignty by colluding with U.S. imperialism to invade Cuba have intensified the people's deep dissatisfaction with the government. The anti-government military actions initiated from within the army "have a broader and more democratic nature, and in this sense are consistent with the people's struggle against the Ydígoras regime."

The statement said, "Guatemala needs to truly become independent, needs to carry out profound social and economic reforms, and fundamentally improve the living conditions of people of all strata. This task can only be accomplished by a revolutionary, truly democratic and patriotic government."

The statement condemned the Ydígoras government's frantic suppression of the people's revolutionary forces and their leaders, and called on the people to be firm, resolute, and bold in their response, and to unite around their own demands to overthrow the dictatorial government.

The statement called on urban and rural workers to launch a general strike, called on all patriotic strata to express their condemnation of the current regime and resolutely stop its repressive measures, and called on the masses throughout the country to rise up and fight to control the current situation.
