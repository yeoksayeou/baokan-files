    Beijing Transportation Department Launches "Cherish Vehicles, Tidy Up Vehicles" Campaign
    According to Xinhua News Agency, while doing a good job in current production, the Beijing Municipal Highway Transportation Department is launching a mass "Cherish Vehicles, Tidy Up Vehicles" campaign, mobilizing workers in the five aspects of use, maintenance, repair, manufacturing, and management to cooperate closely, jointly eliminate "sick vehicles" and "semi-sick vehicles," and strive to ensure that all cars and trailers are in good condition, so as to provide more transportation capacity for the further development of industrial and agricultural production next year.
    In order to further improve the quality of vehicles and give full play to the role of each car, the city's transportation departments conducted a comprehensive inspection of all cars and trailers in late November, in accordance with the spirit of "prevention first." Each garage has organized vehicle tidying groups composed of technicians, material staff, maintenance workers, squad leaders, and drivers, making full use of the time before dispatching and after returning to the garage to carry out the "five checks" focusing on checking engine oil consumption, checking damage to major parts, checking vehicle body condition, checking tires, and checking batteries, setting off a wave of thorough analysis and item-by-item registration and repair of vehicles.
    Through the mass "five checks," workers in the five departments of use, maintenance, repair, manufacturing, and management have a clear understanding of the technical condition of each car and trailer. Subsequently, they have carried out various activities in conjunction with their own work, focusing on improving vehicle quality. Drivers actively launched the "three diligences" (diligent inspection, diligent protection, diligent wiping) and "ten goods" (good tire pressure, etc.) vehicle cherishing campaign to extend the service life of tires and parts. Maintenance workers carry out various maintenance tasks at any time, so as to treat "minor illnesses" promptly. Workers in the repair and manufacturing departments adopt methods such as repairing, fitting, dismantling, piecing together, and modifying to manufacture accessories and repair old parts, so that vehicles can quickly regain "health" and be put into transportation. As a result, a new atmosphere has emerged in which everyone cares about vehicles and everyone cherishes vehicles.
    After this period of work, the quality of vehicles in the Beijing Transportation Department has been further improved. According to statistics from the Beijing Transportation Company alone, comparing November before the launch of the "Cherish Vehicles, Tidy Up Vehicles" campaign with December after the campaign, the number of "sick vehicles" and "semi-sick vehicles" has decreased by 60%.

    北京运输部门开展爱车整车运动
    据新华社讯　北京市公路运输部门在作好当前生产的同时，正在开展一个群众性的爱车、整车运动，发动使用、保养、修理、制造、管理五个方面的职工紧密协作，共同消灭“病车”和“半病车”，力争做到辆辆汽车和挂车性能良好，为明年工农业生产的进一步发展提供更多的运输能力。
    为了进一步提高车辆的质量，充分发挥每辆汽车的作用，全市运输部门在11月下旬根据“预防为主”的精神，对所有的汽车、挂车进行了一次全面大检查。各个车场都组织了由技术员、材料员、保养工、小队长和司机参加的整车小组，充分利用出车前、回场后的时间，普遍开展查引擎机油消耗、查主要部件损坏、查车身状况、查轮胎、查电瓶的“五查”工作，掀起了对车辆部部解剖分析，项项登记整修的热潮。
    通过群众性的“五查”工作，使用、保养、修理、制造、管理五个部门的职工，对每辆汽车和挂车的技术状况都了解得一清二楚。接着，纷纷结合自己的业务，围绕提高车辆质量这一环节，进行各种各样活动。司机积极地展开勤检查、勤保护、勤擦洗的“三勤”和轮胎气压好等“十好”的爱车运动，来延长轮胎和机件的使用寿命。保养工人随时进行各种保养，做到“小病”一露头，就及时医治。修理和制造部门的工人，采取修、配、拆、拼、改等方法，制造配件和修复旧件，使车辆迅速恢复“健康”投入运输。因此出现了人人关心车辆、个个爱护车辆的新气象。
    北京运输部门经过这一段工作以后，车辆的质量已经得到了进一步提高。仅据北京市运输公司统计，开展爱车、整车运动前的11月份和运动后的12月份比较，“病车”和“半病车”的辆数就下降了60％。
