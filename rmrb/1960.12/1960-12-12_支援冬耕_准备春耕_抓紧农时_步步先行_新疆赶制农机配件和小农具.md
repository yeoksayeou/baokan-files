Urumqi, December 11th (People's Daily) – Agricultural tool manufacturing and repair departments in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region are carrying out large-scale repairs and production of various agricultural machines and parts needed for this winter and next spring, in order to fully serve agricultural production.

When arranging the production of agricultural machinery for this winter and next spring, agricultural machinery repair plants in various parts of the Autonomous Region conducted surveys and research on local labor, crop layout and planting seasons, the efficiency and usage of existing agricultural machinery, and other factors. Based on the plant's equipment processing capabilities, material supply, and other conditions, the following measures were adopted:

(1) Agricultural machinery factories in Urumqi, Kashgar, and other places with strong equipment processing capabilities are rushing to produce a batch of agricultural machinery parts that small factories in the special districts and counties cannot produce, and quickly assemble all semi-finished agricultural tools before they leave the factory. In this way, using only a small amount of steel, more than 3,000 double-wheeled double-furrow plows, single-furrow plows, and more than 100 seeders can be produced before the end of the year. (2) Key factories in the Autonomous Region that manufacture agricultural machinery and tractor repair factories in various special districts and autonomous prefectures concentrate materials and processing capabilities to give priority to the manufacturing of tractor parts, tractor-drawn implements, and semi-mechanized farm implements. The number of tractor-drawn implement parts manufactured in the fourth quarter alone will be three times more than the number manufactured in the first three quarters of this year, guaranteeing that more than 90% of tractors currently out of service and damaged tractor-drawn implements will be put into production before spring ploughing. (3) Organize the production of agricultural machinery in stages according to the agricultural season, taking the lead step by step. Most of the spring ploughing tools will be prepared this year, and the first quarter of next year will mainly focus on summer harvesting tools. In addition to rushing to produce a large number of plowshares and seeders, it is estimated that more than a dozen more tractors will be newly manufactured in the fourth quarter than in the first three quarters of this year.

  (4) Intensify the manufacture and repair of small farm tools such as mattocks, shovels, hoes, sickles, and mud knives. The Autonomous Region has specially allocated 200 tons of steel to supply local agricultural tool repair networks, and will rush to produce 500,000 small farm tools before the end of the year.

In the large-scale repair and assembly of agricultural machinery, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has fully utilized the power of the local agricultural tool repair network, which is based on the tractor repair factories in special districts and autonomous prefectures and composed of county and commune agricultural tool factories (stations). More than 130 agricultural machinery and agricultural tool manufacturing and repair factories have been built or are being built throughout the region above the county level, including 14 tractor repair factories. General communes also have agricultural tool repair factories (stations), and production teams have repair groups. In the past, the Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County on the Pamir Plateau had to send repairs of mud knives and sickles to Kashgar City, five or six hundred miles away. This year, with the support of technicians sent by Kashgar City, a county agricultural tool factory was built. In the past five months, it has repaired more than 500 carts, horse-drawn plows, etc., and sand-cast 3,500 agricultural tools and parts such as plowshares, iron harrows, and steel forks.

Due to the power of the local agricultural tool repair network, the entire autonomous region has completed the annual production tasks of ten types of semi-mechanized agricultural tools, such as double-wheeled double-furrow plows, single-furrow plows, seeders, harvesters, and cultivators, two months ahead of schedule, and has newly manufactured more than 700,000 small farm tools.

    支援冬耕　准备春耕　抓紧农时　步步先行
    新疆赶制农机配件和小农具
    本报乌鲁木齐11日电　新疆维吾尔自治区农具制造和修配部门大修大造今冬明春需要的各种农业机具和配件，全力为农业生产服务。
    自治区各地农机具修配厂在安排今冬明春农机具生产时，分别对当地劳力、作物布局和种植季节、现有农机具效率及使用情况等，进行了调查研究，根据本厂设备加工能力、材料供应等条件，采取了下列措施：
    （一）由乌鲁木齐、喀什等地设备加工能力较强的农业机械厂突击赶制一批专区、县的小厂不能制作的农机具配件，把农具半成品迅速全部装配出厂。这样，只用很少钢材，到年底以前就可出厂三千多部双轮双铧犁、单铧犁和一百多部播种机。（二）自治区制造农业机械的骨干工厂和各专区、自治州拖拉机修配厂集中材料、加工能力，优先制造拖拉机、机引农具和半机械化农具的配件。单是第四季度制造的机引农具的配件就将比今年前三个季度制造的多三倍，可保证现在停车的拖拉机和损坏的机引农具在春耕以前有90％以上投入生产。（三）按照农事季节，分阶段组织农机具生产，步步先行。春耕农具大部分在今年准备好，明年第一季度就主要抓夏收农具。各地除了正在赶制大量犁铧、播种机以外，预计第四季度新制出厂的拖拉机比今年前三个季度制造的多十几台。
  （四）加紧制造和修理镢、锨、锄、镰、砍土镘等小件农具。自治区已专门拨出二百吨钢材供给地方农具修配网，在年底以前赶制小件农具五十万件。
    新疆维吾尔自治区在大修大配农业机具中，充分发挥了以专区、自治州拖拉机修配厂为骨干、由县和公社农具厂（站）组成的地方农具修配网的威力。全区已建起和正在建设的县以上农机、农具制造修配厂一百三十多个，其中有十四个拖拉机修配厂。一般公社也都有农具修配厂（站），生产队有修配组。帕米尔高原上的塔什库尔干塔吉克自治县以往修理砍土镘、镰刀都要送到五、六百里外的喀什市，今年在喀什市派技术工人支援下建起了县农具厂，五个月来就修理大车、马拉犁等五百多件，翻砂制造犁铧、铁耙、钢叉等农具和配件三千五百多件。
    由于发挥了地方农具修配网的威力，全自治区已经提前两个月完成了双轮双铧犁、单铧犁、播种机、收割机、中耕农具等十种半机械化农具的全年生产任务，还新制各种小件农具七十多万件。
