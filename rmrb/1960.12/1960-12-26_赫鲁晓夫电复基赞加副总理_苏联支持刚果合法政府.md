Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 25th. TASS, Moscow, December 25th: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, assured Congolese Deputy Prime Minister Gizenga that "The Soviet government, in the past and in the future, will, together with other countries friendly to the Republic of the Congo, provide the Congolese people and their legal government with all possible assistance and support in their just struggle against the colonialists."

This statement by the head of the Soviet government is a response to a telegram from Gizenga in Stanleyville. In his telegram, Gizenga spoke of the threat posed by the Mobutu bandit gang, which launched a civil war, to the Eastern Province of the Republic of the Congo. Gizenga said that the central government of the Congo had moved to the Eastern Province and declared Stanleyville the temporary capital of the Republic of the Congo.

Khrushchev wrote in his telegram: "We fully sympathize with your government's concern about the situation caused by the terror perpetrated by the colonialists and their servants, who arrested your Prime Minister Lumumba, many members of the government and members of parliament."

Khrushchev said that the continued aggression of the imperialist powers against the Republic of the Congo "arouses the indignation of the entire Soviet people."

    赫鲁晓夫电复基赞加副总理
    苏联支持刚果合法政府
    新华社25日讯　塔斯社莫斯科25日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫向刚果共和国副总理基赞加保证说，“苏联政府过去和今后都同其他对刚果共和国友好的国家一道，给予刚果人民及其合法政府在他们反对殖民主义者的正义斗争中以一切可能的帮助和支持。”
    苏联政府首脑的这一声明是对基赞加从斯坦利维尔来电的答复。基赞加在电报中谈到发动内战的蒙博托匪帮对刚果共和国东方省的威胁。基赞加说，刚果中央政府迁到了东方省，并宣布斯坦利维尔市为刚果共和国临时首都。
    赫鲁晓夫在电报中写道：“我们完全同情贵国政府对由于殖民主义者及其仆从实行恐怖手段而造成的局势的忧虑，他们逮捕了贵国政府总理卢蒙巴、政府的许多成员和议会议员。”
    赫鲁晓夫说，帝国主义列强对刚果共和国继续进行的侵略，“激起全体苏联人民的愤怒”。
