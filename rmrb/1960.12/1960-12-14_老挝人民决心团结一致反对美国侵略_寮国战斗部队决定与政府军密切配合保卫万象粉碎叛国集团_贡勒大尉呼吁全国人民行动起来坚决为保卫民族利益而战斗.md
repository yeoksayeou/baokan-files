Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 13th: According to a broadcast today by the Lao Fighting Forces radio station, the Supreme Command of the Lao Fighting Forces Armed Forces issued an order on December 12th to cadres and soldiers of the national troops and people's armed forces, calling on the Lao people nationwide, in the current serious situation, to vigorously support Prince Souvanna Phouma's government, resolutely defend the capital Vientiane and liberate Luang Prabang, deplete the enemy's strength, overthrow the traitorous clique, and further eliminate the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique and drive the American interventionists out of Laos, in order to defend the fatherland, religion, the king, the constitution, the path of peace and neutrality, and national harmony.

    The order pointed out, "In the people's struggle, the Lao Fighting Forces, the government army, and the army of the coup committee headed by Captain Kong Le are decisive pillars."

    The order said, "U.S. imperialism and Thai reactionaries are directing the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique to mobilize troops to attack the capital Vientiane. Their purpose is to overthrow the legal government of Prince Souvanna Phouma, establish a puppet government, in order to realize their conspiracy to continue to expand the civil war, undermine the path of peace and neutrality and national harmony, and turn Laos into a U.S. military colony and military base. At present, the troops of the Phoumi-Boun Oum rebel clique, under the direct command of U.S. officers, and with U.S. aircraft piloted by Chiang Kai-shek clique pilots transporting weapons and war materials from Thailand, are advancing towards Vientiane from the direction of North Jia, coordinating with the Kouprasith Abhay rebels in the Kineimo-That area to attack the capital Vientiane. The above situation proves that U.S. imperialism and the Thai reactionary group are openly and directly interfering in and invading our motherland, and the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous group is determined to sell Laos to U.S. imperialism."

    The order said, "The fate of our motherland and the lives of the people are facing unprecedentedly serious threats. The sovereignty of our country is being trampled on by U.S. imperialism and the Thai reactionary group. The center of our country—the capital Vientiane—is under serious threat from foreign reactionary groups and the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique."

    The Supreme Command of the Lao Fighting Forces hereby issues the following orders to all cadres, soldiers, and guerrillas:

    First, continue to comprehensively develop the struggle throughout the country and vigorously promote guerrilla warfare.

    Second, in Vientiane, closely coordinate with the government army and armed forces to resolutely resist any attacks by the Phoumi-Boun Oum rebel clique's troops, encircle and suppress the enemy by encirclement and flanking attacks, or any other means to eliminate the enemy's active forces, block the enemy during their advance, and then annihilate the enemy's main force.

    Third, in Xieng Khouang, central Laos, and lower Laos, it is necessary to launch offensives against the enemy's strongholds, especially the enemy's weak links. Develop guerrilla warfare universally and vigorously, cut off the enemy's supply lines and transportation, blockade and cut off the enemy's supplies, harass the enemy's main forces everywhere, and deplete their active forces. Continue to maintain contact with the Kingdom's army loyal to the government, avoid conflicts with them, discuss issues with them, and jointly strike against the rebels. Let us call on the patriotic cadres and soldiers who have been deceived and oppressed to break free from the control of the Phoumi-Boun Oum group and return to the side of the people.

    Fourth, in Luang Prabang, it is necessary to cooperate with the Kingdom's army to jointly implement the instructions of the Phouma government, stop mutual conflicts, and jointly concentrate forces to closely surround Luang Prabang, attack Phoumi's henchman, the Boun Than elements, relieve the siege of the King, and liberate Luang Prabang from the control of the rebels.

    The order said, "Although our struggle has encountered many difficulties, it also has many favorable conditions. The unity and fighting spirit of the people and the army throughout the country are higher than ever, and the determination to resist America and save the country is more resolute than ever. The peace-loving people of the world fully support the just struggle of our people. Conversely, the American interventionists and the Phoumi-Boun Oum rebel clique are condemned by our people and the people of the world."

    The order finally said, we must carry forward the spirit of heroic struggle and the glorious tradition of the Lao Fighting Forces. "The people of the whole country place their trust in our resolute struggle, we must move forward!"

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 13th: According to a broadcast by Vientiane Radio today, Captain Kong Le, Chairman of the Lao Coup Committee, issued an appeal to the Lao people, calling on the people to enhance their patriotism, unite as one, and take action together to oppose the aggression of foreign groups headed by the United States and the traitorous activities of the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak group, so that the capital Vientiane and the people's families, lives, and property can be spared from disaster.

    The appeal said, "This is the time for action. Each of us must sacrifice and fight to defend the great interests of the Lao nation and people. We would rather die than be slaves of the barbaric colonial system of U.S. imperialism and Thailand, and we would rather not be exploited by the Phoumi Nosavan-Kouprasith Abhay traitorous clique."

    The appeal exposed that the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique, in the past three days, attempted to use the deceptive trick of "peace negotiations" to prevent the Kingdom's army from attacking them, so that they would have time to consolidate their forces. The appeal said that in the past three days, they have mobilized part of their forces to control the stronghold from Kineimo to That, and U.S., Thai, South Vietnamese, and Chiang Kai-shek clique officers have appeared in the troops of the traitorous clique. They are trying to attack the capital Vientiane, subvert the legal government of Phouma, establish a dictatorial reactionary "government," and then undermine the path of peace and neutrality, continue the civil war, and turn Laos into a foreign colony.

    The actions of the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique fully prove that they are destroying our nation. The actions of U.S. imperialism, Thailand, South Vietnam, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique to help Phoumi Nosavan-Kouprasith Abhay clearly show that they are invading Laos.

    The appeal said that our war will inevitably encounter many difficulties and become more intense. However, we believe that the Kingdom's army, fighting in coordination with the Lao Fighting Forces Armed Forces, the people's armed forces, and the police, with the support of the people of the whole country and all peace-loving countries in the world, will surely win victory, and foreign aggressors and the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique are bound to fail.

    Vientiane Radio also broadcast this noon an appeal from Lieutenant Doune, Deputy Chairman of the Coup Committee, to those officers and soldiers who have been deceived by the imperialists and the Phoumi-Boun Oum group, calling on them to recognize the truth, stop fighting against the government army, and not become victims of U.S. imperialism and the traitorous clique.

    老挝人民决心团结一致反对美国侵略
    寮国战斗部队决定与政府军密切配合保卫万象粉碎叛国集团
    贡勒大尉呼吁全国人民行动起来坚决为保卫民族利益而战斗
    新华社河内13日电　据寮国战斗部队电台今天广播，寮国战斗部队武装力量最高司令部12日向全国部队和人民武装力量的干部和战士发布命令，号召老挝全国人民在当前严重局势下，为了保卫祖国、宗教、国王、宪法和和平中立、民族和睦的路线，必须大力支持梭发那·富马亲王政府，坚决保卫首都万象和解放琅勃拉邦市，消耗敌人的有生力量，打倒叛国集团的势力，进而消灭富米—文翁叛国集团，并把美国干涉者从老挝赶出去。
    命令指出，“在全民斗争中，寮国战斗部队、政府军、以贡勒大尉为首的政变委员会的军队，是具有决定性的支柱。”
    命令说，“美帝国主义和泰国反动分子正在指使富米—文翁叛国集团调动兵力进攻首都万象。它们的目的是企图推翻梭发那·富马亲王的合法政府，建立傀儡政府，以便实现其继续扩大内战，破坏和平中立和民族和睦路线，把老挝变为美国的军事殖民地和军事基地的阴谋。目前，富米—文翁叛乱集团的军队在美国军官的直接指挥下，并且得到蒋介石集团的驾驶员驾驶的美国飞机从泰国运来武器和战争物资，正在从北加定向万象推进，以配合在基乃莫—塔德地区的库·帕西·阿贝叛军进攻首都万象。上述情况证明美帝国主义和泰国反动集团明目张胆地直接干涉和侵略我们的祖国，富米—文翁叛国集团死心塌地地把老挝出卖给美帝国主义。”
    命令说，“我们祖国的命运和人民的生命正在受到空前严重的威胁。我们国家的主权正在遭到美帝国主义和泰国反动集团的蹂躏。我们国家的中心——首都万象正在受到外国反动集团和富米—文翁叛国集团的严重威胁。”
    寮国战斗部队最高司令部特向全体干部、战士和游击队发布命令如下：
    一，继续全面发展全国的斗争，大力推进游击战争。
    二，在万象，与政府军和武装力量密切配合，坚决抗击富米—文翁叛乱集团军队的任何进攻，向敌人实行围剿和侧击、或其他一切办法来消灭敌人有生力量，在敌军推进途中阻击敌人，进而歼击敌人的主力。
    三，在川圹、中寮和下寮，必须向敌人的据点，特别是敌人的薄弱环节发动攻势。普遍地、大力地发展游击战争，断绝敌人的补给线和交通运输，封锁和切断敌人的供应，对各地的敌军主力进行骚扰并消耗其有生力量。继续同忠于政府的王国军队保持联系，避免和他们发生冲突，并和他们共同讨论问题，共同打击叛军。让我们号召受欺骗和压迫的爱国的干部和战士们摆脱富米—文翁集团的控制，回到人民这一边来。
    四，在琅勃拉邦，必须配合王国军队，共同执行富马政府的指示，停止互相间的冲突，共同集中力量来紧密包围琅勃拉邦市，攻击富米集团的爪牙奔当分子，为国王解围，并把琅勃拉邦市从叛军的控制下解放出来。
    命令说，“我们的斗争虽然碰到许多困难，但同时具备许多有利条件，全国人民和军队的团结和斗争精神比任何时候都高涨，反美救国的斗志比任何时候都更加坚决，全世界爱好和平人民全力支持我国人民的正义斗争。相反的，美国干涉者和富米—文翁叛乱集团遭到我国人民和世界人民的谴责。”
    命令最后说，我们必须发扬英勇战斗的精神和寮国战斗部队的光荣传统。“全国人民对我们的坚决斗争寄予信赖，我们必须前进！”
    新华社河内13日电　据万象电台今天广播，老挝政变委员会主席贡勒大尉向老挝人民发出呼吁书，呼吁人民提高爱国精神，团结一致，一道行动起来反对以美国为首的外国集团的侵略和富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞集团的叛国活动，使首都万象和人民的家庭、生命财产免于灾祸。
    呼吁书说，“这是行动的时候了，我们每一个人都必须为保卫老挝民族和人民的巨大利益而牺牲和战斗。我们宁死也不愿作美帝国主义和泰国的野蛮的殖民地制度的奴隶，也不愿受到富米·诺萨万—库·帕西·阿贝叛国集团的剥削。”
    呼吁书揭露富米·诺萨万叛国集团在过去三天中，企图以“和平谈判”的欺骗手法，阻止王国军队向他们进攻，使他们有时间来巩固力量。呼吁书说，过去三天，他们已经调动一部分兵力来控制由基乃莫到塔德的据点，叛国集团的军队里出现美国、泰国、南越和蒋介石集团的军官，他们企图进攻首都万象，颠复富马合法政府，成立独裁的反动“政府”，进而破坏和平中立路线，延续内战，把老挝变成外国的殖民地。
    富米·诺萨万叛国集团的行动充分证明了他们正在摧毁我们的民族。美帝国主义、泰国、南越和蒋介石集团帮助富米·诺萨万—库·帕西·阿贝的行动，清楚地表明了他们正在侵略老挝。
    呼吁书说，我们的战争必将遇到许多困难并且更加激烈。但是，我们相信，王国军队同寮国战斗部队武装力量、人民武装力量和警察配合作战，在全国人民和全世界爱好和平各国的支持下，必将取得胜利，外国侵略者和富米·诺萨万叛国集团必定失败。
    万象电台今天中午还广播了政变委员会副主席敦中尉向那些受帝国主义和富米—文翁集团蒙蔽的官兵发出的呼吁书，号召他们认清真象，停止对政府军队作战，不作美帝国主义和叛国集团的牺牲品。
