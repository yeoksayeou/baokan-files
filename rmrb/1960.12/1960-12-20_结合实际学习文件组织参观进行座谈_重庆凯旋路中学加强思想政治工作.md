Combining Practical Study of Documents, Organizing Visits, and Conducting Discussions
Chongqing Kaixuan Road Middle School Strengthens Ideological and Political Work

(Our report) The Party organization of Chongqing’s Kaixuan Road Middle School, while vigorously strengthening ideological and political work in the school, has also adopted various measures to actively help class teachers, political instructors, and Communist Youth League and Young Pioneer cadres improve their political and professional levels. This semester, the Party branch designated a deputy secretary to be specifically responsible for this aspect of work. They regularly study the ideological and work situations of class teachers, political instructors, and Communist Youth League and Young Pioneer cadres, and promptly resolve any problems they discover. For example, at the beginning of the semester, the branch found that a few class teachers had a fear of difficulty in “balancing teaching with class teacher work,” so it organized everyone to study articles such as "Revolutionary Zeal - The Party Spirit of a Communist Party Member" and "To Make Revolution, One Must Have Revolutionary Ambition," and launched discussions, quickly reversing this sentiment. Recently, the branch discovered that some teachers of political classes tended to "prepare lessons behind closed doors" and did not sufficiently connect current struggles and the students' ideological realities in their teaching. The branch promptly organized everyone to study documents such as Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on strengthening ideological and political work, repeatedly discussing the principle that ideological and political education must implement the integration of theory and practice, enabling the teachers to more deeply realize the harm of neglecting politics, emphasizing professional work, and teaching that is divorced from reality. Currently, the teachers of this school have begun to pay attention to teaching in connection with student ideological trends, and as a result, the quality of teaching has also improved.

In addition to grasping the leadership of the political theory study of these teachers and ensuring that they have sufficient study time, the Party branch also organizes class teachers, political instructors, and Communist Youth League and Young Pioneer cadres to conduct repeated studies in each political movement or before the start of each teaching unit, in conjunction with the teachers' ideological trends. The Party branch also purposefully organizes political instructors to visit factories and urban and rural people's communes, invites veteran cadres and advanced figures to give reports, and mobilizes teachers to participate in a certain amount of labor. Through these activities, not only have the teachers quickly improved their political and theoretical levels, but also their ideological awareness has been greatly enhanced through practical training.

In addition, the Party organization of this school also provides concrete assistance to class teachers and political instructors in various aspects such as teaching methods. Branch secretaries and branch committee members often go deep into a class, and together with the class teachers and Communist Youth League and Young Pioneer cadres, study and analyze the students' ideological dynamics, learning, and life, and propose measures for strengthening students' ideological and political education to the class teachers and Communist Youth League and Young Pioneer cadres. Class teachers also regularly convene joint meetings of class teachers, political instructors, and Communist Youth League and Young Pioneer cadres to study and analyze the students' ideological trends in the previous period and determine the focus of student ideological and political education in the next stage, so that the teachers are clear about the situation and have a clear direction, thereby effectively improving the teachers' work level. At present, the work of more than two-thirds of the class teachers and political instructors in this school is more in-depth and more solid than before. (Attached picture)

    结合实际学习文件组织参观进行座谈
    重庆凯旋路中学加强思想政治工作
    本报讯　重庆市凯旋路中学党组织在大力加强学校思想政治工作的同时，又采取各种措施，积极帮助班主任、政治课教师和团、队干部提高政治水平和业务水平。这个学期中，支部指定一个副书记专门负责这一方面工作。经常研究班主任、政治课教师和团队干部的思想和工作情况，发现问题，及时解决。如开学初，支部发现少数班主任中存在着“抓教学难以兼顾班主任工作”的畏难情绪，就组织大家学习“革命的干劲——共产党员的党性”、“干革命要有革命的志气”等文章，并发动大家讨论，很快扭转了这种情绪。最近，支部又在政治课教师中发现个别教师有“关门备课”、在教学中联系当前斗争和学生思想实际不够的倾向，支部就及时组织大家结合对林彪同志关于加强政治思想工作的指示等文件的学习，对思想政治教育必须贯彻理论联系实际的原则的问题，进行了多次讨论，使教师们比较深刻地认识到轻政治、重业务、教学脱离实际的危害性。目前，这个学校的教师们已开始注意结合学生思想动向进行教学，因而教学质量也有了提高。
    党支部除了抓紧对这些教师的政治理论学习的领导，保证他们有充分的学习时间外，在每个政治运动中或每个教学单元开始前，还结合教师们的思想动向，专门组织班主任、政治课教师和团队干部进行反复地学习。党支部还有目的地组织政治课教师们参观、访问工厂和城乡人民公社，请老干部和先进人物作报告，并发动教师们参加一定时间的劳动等。通过这些活动，不但使教师们迅速提高了政治理论水平，而且使他们通过实际的锻炼，思想觉悟也大大提高了。
    此外，这个学校的党组织还在教学方法等各方面给班主任、政治课教师以具体帮助。支部书记和支部委员们经常深入一个班，与班主任、团队干部们一起，研究分析学生们的思想动态和学习、生活等，给班主任和团队干部们提出加强学生思想政治教育的措施。班主任还定期召开班主任、政治课教师和团队干部联席会议，研究分析前段时期学生的思想动向，确定下一阶段学生政治思想教育中心，使教师们做到心中有数，方向明确，从而有效地提高了教师们的工作水平。目前这个学校有三分之二以上的班主任、政治课教师的工作都比以前更深入更踏实。（附图片）
