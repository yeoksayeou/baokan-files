	Comprehensively Plan and Focus on Manufacturing Farm Tools
	Jiangdu County, Jiangsu Province, has adopted a method of three-level division of labor at the county, commune, and team levels, fighting on separate lines, and launching a winter-spring farm tool repair and manufacturing campaign. They have sorted out the farm tools that need to be repaired and manufactured one by one, and formulated repair and manufacturing priorities for various regions based on the characteristics of different regions. In terms of repair and manufacturing time, arrangements have also been made according to the agricultural season requirements, and it has been determined that the winter-spring farm tool repair and manufacturing work will be carried out in three stages. The first stage focuses on repairing and manufacturing tools for accumulating and applying fertilizer and for field management; the second stage focuses on repairing and manufacturing farm tools for spring plowing and spring planting; the third stage concludes the repair and manufacturing tasks for summer harvesting and summer planting farm tools.
	At present, the first stage of repair and manufacturing tasks has been basically completed. A total of 210,000 pieces of various farm tools such as large shovels, iron shovels, and hoes have been repaired and manufactured, of which more than 66% are repairs. The county has also begun to focus on repairing and manufacturing farm tools for spring plowing and spring planting.

	Each Laborer Has Four Handy Farm Tools
	In order to meet the needs of agricultural production for small farm tools such as spades, mattocks, sickles, and hoes, the Hunyuan County Committee of Shanxi Province has paid special attention to the manufacturing and repair of small farm tools since the beginning of this spring. As of now, more than 163,000 pieces of small farm tools such as spades, mattocks, sickles, and hoes have been manufactured and repaired. Among them, 112,900 pieces of farm tools have been added, and more than 50,000 pieces of farm tools have been repaired. Including the original ones, the county has a total of more than 493,000 pieces of various small farm tools. On average, each of the county's 74,000 men and women full and semi-laborers has handy farm tools such as spades, mattocks, sickles, and hoes, ensuring the needs of production this winter and next spring. At the same time, it also supported more than 25,000 pieces to fraternal counties such as Lingqiu, Fanshi, and Yanggao.

	Self-Reliance to Solve Raw Material Problems
	In the winter farm tool repair work, Qidong County, Hunan Province, mobilized the masses to solve the problem of insufficient raw materials and materials through self-reliance, so that the farm tool repair task was completed quickly and with good quality. Now, the county has repaired more than 150,000 pieces of deep plows, improved harrows, hoes, harrow heads, and various rain gear, accounting for more than 81% of the number to be repaired. The manufactured small farm tools, rain gear, and medium-sized farm tools account for 52% of the number to be manufactured, supplementing a large number of sharp tools for the front line of production.
	The small farm tools that commune members need to repair are generally brought by themselves with raw materials, materials, or old farm tools. Many brigades, production teams, and work groups have also adopted methods such as using rattan instead of bamboo, utilizing waste materials, renovating old materials, and saving materials to solve the problem of insufficient raw materials and materials. Industrial and commercial departments have also cleared out a batch of scrap iron, scrap steel, wood, and fuel from the clearing of warehouses and the purchase of waste products for the repair and manufacture of farm tools.

	Small Blacksmiths Repair and Manufacture Farm Tools Door-to-Door
	Dongguanzhuang Management District of Chengguan Commune in Wenxi County, Shanxi Province, organized three small blacksmiths and four scattered carpenters in the district to bring furniture to production teams, commune members' families, and fields to repair and manufacture small farm tools. From the beginning of September to now, they have repaired and manufactured more than 1,000 pieces of large and small farm tools.
	Small blacksmiths going door-to-door facilitates the use of old waste materials, and can also make handy farm tools according to the needs of commune members, improving quality, reducing costs, and saving commune members' time.

	Huazhou Commune Establishes Farm Tool Repair and Manufacturing Network
	Based on the principle of rational layout, rational division of labor, and farm tool repair and manufacturing work being close to the front line of agricultural production, Huazhou Commune in Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, has built an agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing network that can undertake the repair and manufacturing tasks of farmland water conservancy, transportation, and farming tools for the entire commune in less than a year.
	The repair and manufacturing tasks of the main tools currently used in agricultural production, such as shovels, hoes, adzes, sickles, plows, harrows, and transportation tools such as carts and handcarts, have been undertaken by the commune-run and production team-run repair and manufacturing plants and groups located in various management areas, and they also undertake part of the manufacturing tasks.

    为春耕修造更多的小农具
    全面规划重点修造农具
    江苏江都县采取县社队三级分工、分线作战、分项突击的方法，掀起了冬春农具修造运动。他们对需要修造的农具逐项排队，根据不同地区的特点，订出各类地区的修造重点。在修造时间上，也根据农时要求作了安排，确定冬春农具修造工作分三个阶段进行。第一个阶段以修造积肥施肥和田间管理工具为主；第二个阶段突击修造春耕春种农具；第三个阶段结束夏收夏种农具的修造任务。
    目前第一个阶段的修造任务已基本上完成。共修造大锹、铁铲、锄头等各种农具二十一万件，其中修理的占66％以上。全县又开始突击修造春耕春种的农具。
    每个劳力有四件得心应手农具
    山西浑源县委为了满足农业生产上所需要的锹、钁、镰、锄等小农具，今年入春以来，就特别注意了小农具的制造修配工作，到目前为止，已制造修配了锹钁镰锄等小农具十六万三千余件。其中，增添农具十一万二千九百件，修配农具五万余件。加上原有的，全县共有各种小农具四十九万三千余件，平均全县七万四千个男女全半劳力，每个劳力都有得心应手的锹、钁、镰、锄等农具，保证了今冬明春生产的需要。同时还支援了灵丘、繁峙、阳高等兄弟县二万五千余件。
    自力更生解决原材料
    湖南祁东县在冬修农具工作中，发动群众自力更生解决原料、材料不足的问题，使农具修配任务完成快，质量好。现在，全县已修理的深耕犁、改良耙、锄头、耙头和各种雨具共十五万多件，占应修数的81％强，制造的小农具、雨具和中型农具，占应制数的52％，为生产第一线补充了大批利器。
    社员需要修理的小农具，一般都自带原料、材料或旧农具来修理。许多大队、生产队、作业组还采取以藤代竹、废物利用、翻旧补新、节约用材等办法，解决原料、材料不足的问题。工业和商业部门也从清仓和收购的废品中清理出一批废铁、废钢、木材和燃料，供给修造农具用。
    小炉匠上门修制农具
    山西闻喜县城关公社东官庄管理区，组织全区三个小炉匠和四个零散木工，带上家具，到生产队、社员家庭与田间修造小农具，从9月上旬到现在，共修制了大小农具一千多件。
    小炉匠上门，便于利用旧废料，并且可以根据社员的需要做出得心应手的农具，提高质量，降低成本，节省社员时间。
    华州公社建成农具修配网
    陕西渭南县华州公社本着合理布点、合理分工、农具修配工作接近农业生产第一线的原则，在不到一年的时间内，已经建成了一个能够担负全社农田水利、运输、耕作工具等修造任务的农业机具修配制造网。
    当前农业生产上所使用的主要工具锨、锄、镢、镰、犁、耙和架子车、手推车等运输工具的修配任务，已由设在各个管区的社办和生产队办的修配厂、组担负起来，并且担负部分制造任务。
