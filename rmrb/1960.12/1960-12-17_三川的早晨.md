Morning in Sanchuan
Jiang Zhi Shui
　　The train climbed over the Qinling Mountains and passed through countless large and small tunnels, finally arriving at Lueyang. It left us here, and after a brief rest, sped towards the peaks of the Bashan Mountains.

　　I walked along the emerald green Jialing River. I asked a passerby carrying a "bamboo basket" of radishes for directions to the county committee. He turned to look at me and pointed forward with his mouth, saying, "See that Phoenix Mountain ahead? The Jialing Academy at the foot of the mountain is where it is." I looked towards the mountain he indicated. Amidst the surrounding peaks, there was indeed a mountain that rested there steadily, resembling an opened feather fan. The mountain was covered with golden sawtooth oak trees, and fiery red maple trees were interspersed among this golden expanse, adding color to the mountain. From a distance, the entire mountain looked like a beautiful phoenix spreading its wings.

　　Lueyang County is located between the Qinling and Bashan Mountains, with difficult transportation, thin soil, and a small population, a mountainous area prone to summer droughts and autumn floods. Before liberation, the people's lives were terribly poor. The first county party secretary to take office after liberation rode into the mountains on a small donkey. When he arrived, he saw streets filled with farmers carrying meager mountain products, traveling long distances to the county town to exchange for salt. They lacked clothing and slept in piles of tangled grass. The old society also left many of them with painful goiters... Only after liberation did people end such lives. And as for grain, many places still had to rely on state supplies every year. However, since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the situation has changed. The county party secretary told me that the situation was similar in many communes, and he immediately cited the example of the Sanchuan Brigade in the Baishui River Commune. This brigade is located on a high mountain 1,700 meters above sea level, with flat land accounting for only one-tenth of its area. The people's lives have been very hard throughout the years, and in 1957 they were short more than 20,000 catties of grain. Since the establishment of the People's Commune, however, it has seen increased production for three consecutive years, and the surplus grain sold to the state has been increasing every year. He said that I had come at the right time, as Liu Junlin, the branch secretary who led the Sanchuan Brigade to change its backward state, was in the county attending an expansion cadre meeting, and I could talk to him.

　　Early the next morning, I met Liu Junlin. He was wearing a black cotton coat and had a stubble of short beard, but his eyes seemed particularly energetic. Before the meeting started, we sat down and talked.

　　Liu Junlin is just over forty years old this year. He worked as a hired laborer for landlords since he was a child. He was conscripted into the army before liberation. He joined the revolution in 1948 and later joined the Party. In 1951, he returned to his hometown after demobilization from the army, and served as the director of an advanced cooperative and the head of the township. Since 1957, he served as the Party branch secretary of the Sanchuan Production Team. After returning, he did not forget his life in the army. Now he raises two hunting dogs, and always carries a hunting gun to hunt wild animals when he goes out. He was a good marksman since he was young, and had received rigorous training in the army. In the past year or so, he has shot two golden leopards, several musk deer, and black bears. Now his interest in hunting has not diminished, but it is not just for personal preference. Originally, there were many birds and animals in the deep mountains and old forests of Sanchuan that harmed crops, and in one year, they destroyed 60% of the crops.

　　Liu Junlin brought the Party's specific instructions to Sanchuan, and he was determined to change the backward state of Sanchuan under the leadership of the Party. He firmly grasped the Party's instructions and tried every means to expand the cultivated area and increase the yield per unit area. Therefore, when he saw the mountains of Sanchuan, he thought: more mountains, more grain. He visited the masses and remembered what they said:
　　"To fill the granary with grain, you have to go up the high mountains; to eat your fill, you have to run all over the mountains." In order to realize the Party's policy, he mobilized the masses and turned the Party's ideology into the actions of the entire branch, all cadres, and all commune members, and reclaimed several thousand acres of land last year alone. He vividly carried out a series of branch activities. Take the old men of Sanchuan for example. In the past, some of them said, we are old and useless, and no one listens to us. When Liu Junlin heard this, he organized a "Old Peasant Advisory Department" to unite the experienced old peasants and let them offer advice on production and care about collective production. The "Old Peasant Advisory Department" also regularly holds forums to exchange experiences, and the branch also regularly conducts propaganda and education for them. This year, they came up with the ideas of terracing on slopes and combining spot sowing and broadcasting for corn on steep slopes to prevent bird damage. As a result of the propaganda to the old peasants, they not only did not resist when promoting new agricultural tools and new cultivation methods, but also became active promoters. Not only the old peasants, but also the young people of Sanchuan organized a "political and ideological work network" under the leadership of the branch, and the women organized a "women's joint network." Liu Junlin also planted "command fields" and ran "command canteens" to experiment with and drive the work of the entire team. Usually, all the people in the brigade divide their forces to carry out activities, and all the work is carried out very actively, so the Party's policies are quickly and widely implemented. The Sanchuan Brigade office is near Liu Junlin's home, and he often has to attend telephone conferences here at night. No matter what important notice or emergency weather forecast is sent by the county or commune, he always puts down the phone, immediately picks up a kerosene lamp or lights a torch, and delivers the message throughout the mountains. The mountain roads are difficult to walk at night, and sometimes he has to walk dozens of miles, but he has always done this conscientiously. Therefore, the production team cadres and commune members affectionately praised him for "policy does not stay overnight."

　　In the past, few people had been to the remote deep mountains and old forests of Sanchuan. Liu Junlin always climbs several mountains every year to inspect work in these places. Once he set off with a "bamboo basket" full of salt and tea. On top of a high mountain, he found a few houses, which was the home of commune member Fu Huaiyu. The room was empty, and he only saw an old woman. After talking, the old woman reflected that her home was too far from the canteen, and the food was delivered to the mountain every day, so the food was inevitably cold or late. In order to arrange the old woman's life, he obtained the consent of the old woman's family and personally carried the seventy-year-old woman across the mountains to live in the public canteen at the foot of the mountain. Recently, Liu Junlin came here again and saw the old woman again. At that time, she was sitting on the earthen kang basking in the sun. She was eating so well in the public canteen that her face was flushed with good health. She also amused herself by weaving straw sandals in her spare time. When she saw Liu Junlin, she thanked him repeatedly, praising the canteen. However, who knows that on this mountain, after liberation, when our cadres came to the mountains to visit the poor and ask about their sufferings, they found many full skeletons lying on the ground in these empty houses, and people had died of illness and starvation without anyone knowing when! ...

　　At night, I was reading the Sanchuan Production Team's summary report on increasing production to the county under the lamp. There are many figures in it, and every comparative figure is jumping in front of my eyes. They seem to be singing joyful songs, making people both surprised and excited after reading it. Looking at this material, Liu Junlin's tall figure appeared in my mind again. I seemed to feel that he had already finished the expansion cadre meeting and returned to Sanchuan. He was again holding a torch in the deep mountains, transmitting light and bringing the Party's policies to every mountain village...

　　In the distance, the whistle of a train came, and a train was speeding past on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. I thought, I can't wait for Liu Junlin to finish the meeting. Tomorrow morning, I will take a train to Baishui River Station first, and then cross several mountains. I want to see the sunny morning of Sanchuan with my own eyes as soon as possible...

    三川的早晨
    江之水
    火车爬过秦岭又穿过无数个大大小小的山洞，终于开到了略阳。它在这里抛下了我们，只稍作喘息便又向着巴山之巅奔去了。
    我沿着碧绿的嘉陵江走着。我打听前面那个背了一“背兜”萝卜的行人，问他到县委会怎么走，他回头望望我，又往前呶呶嘴说：“瞧见前面那座凤凰山了吗？山下边的嘉陵书院里就是。”我往他说的山那边望去，在群峰中间，确实有一座像打开了的羽扇似的山平稳地歇在那里。满山是金黄色的青棡树，火红的二月枫间杂在这一片金黄中，给这山增添了颜色。远远看去，整个大山俨如一只正铺展开羽翼的美丽的凤凰。
    略阳县地处秦岭巴山之间，交通困难，土薄人少，是个夏旱秋涝的万山之地。解放前人民的生活穷得可怕。刚解放第一个到任的县委书记是骑着一头小毛驴进山来的。他来的时候，满街看到的是背负着一点可怜的山中土产、长途跋涉地到县城来换盐巴的农民，他们缺衣少裤，就睡在一片乱草堆里，旧社会又给他们不少人留下了痛苦的大脖子病……。直到解放之后，人们才结束了这般生活。而粮食呢，不少地方却年年还得依靠国家供给。但是，自从1958年大跃进以来，情况就改变了。县委书记跟我说许多公社的情况都是如此，他一下子就举出白水江公社三川大队的例子来。这个大队地处拔海一千七百米的高山上，平地只占了十分之一，历年来人民生活很苦，1957年还缺粮两万多斤。人民公社成立以后，这三年来却连年增产，每年卖给国家的余粮都在增加。他说我来得正巧，领导三川大队改变落后面貌的总支书记刘俊林正在县里开扩干会，可以找他去谈谈。
    第二天一大早，我就遇到了刘俊林。他穿了一身黑布棉衣，满嘴是短胡楂，两只眼睛却显得分外有精神。我们趁着大会还没有开始，便相对谈起来了。
    刘俊林今年四十岁刚过。他从小给地主当雇工，解放前被拉了壮丁，1948年参加革命，后来入了党。1951年便由部队复员回乡，曾经担任过高级社的主任和乡长等工作，1957年起担任了三川生产队的支部书记。他回来以后还不忘部队生活，如今自己喂了两条猎狗，逢到外出时总要背上猎枪打野兽。他少年时就枪法很准，在部队里更受过严格的锻炼，最近一年多，已打得两头金钱豹、几支麝和黑熊了。如今他打猎的兴趣不减当年，然而这又不单单是为了个人的喜好。原来在三川的深山老林里为害庄稼的鸟兽很多，有一年的庄稼竟让它们给破坏了60％。
    刘俊林到三川带来了党的具体指示，他决心要在党的领导下改变三川的落后面貌。他紧紧抓住党的指示，想尽办法扩大耕地面积，提高单位面积产量。因此他看到三川的大山，想的便是：山多粮就多。他访问群众，就记住了群众说的：
  “要让粮满仓，还得上高山；要想吃得饱，还得满山跑。”为了实现党的这项方针，他发动群众，把党的思想变成全支部、全体干部、全体社员的行动，仅去年就开荒好几千亩土地。他生动地开展了一系列的支部活动。就以三川的老汉们来说吧，过去他们有的说，咱人老不中用了，说话没人听。这话被刘俊林听到，他跟着就组织起一个“老农参谋部”，把有生产经验的老农们团结起来，让他们在生产上出谋献策，关心起集体生产来。“老农参谋部”还经常举行座谈会交流经验，支部也经常对他们进行宣传教育。今年坡地垅作，陡坡玉米点播、撒播相结合防鸟害等办法都是他们出的主意。由于对老农宣传的结果，在推广新式农具和新耕作方法时，他们不仅没有阻力而且成了积极的宣传者。不仅老农如此，三川的青年们在支部的领导下还组织了“政治思想工作网”，妇女们组织了“妇女联合网”。刘俊林还种了“指挥田”，办了“指挥食堂”，试验和带动全队的工作。队里70％的干部和社员也都搞了丰产试验方。平时全大队的各路人马分兵活动，各项工作开展得很活跃，因此贯彻党的政策很快也很广泛。三川大队办公室靠近刘俊林家，夜里他常要在这里参加电话会议。不管是县、公社发来的任何一项重要通知，或是紧急气象预报，他总是放下了电话，马上提起一只马灯或是点着火把，在山里四处传递消息。夜里山路难走，甚至有时要走上几十里，可是他兢兢业业地一贯如此。所以生产队的干部和社员们都亲热地称赞他这是“政策不过夜”。
    三川边远的深山老林过去很少人到过，刘俊林每年总要翻几座大山到这些地方去检查工作。有一次他背了满“背兜”的盐、茶叶又出发了。在一座高山顶上，他找到几间房子，那是社员傅怀玉的家。进屋后四处空空的，只看到一位老妈妈。经过谈天，这老妈妈反映家离食堂太远，每天吃饭由人往山上送，饭菜难免有冷热迟早的问题。为了安排好老人家的生活，他征得老人全家的同意，亲自翻山越岭地把七十多岁的老人背到了山坡下的公共食堂来住。最近刘俊林又来到了这里，重又看到了老妈妈。那时她正坐在土炕上晒太阳，吃公共食堂的饭只吃得她满脸红通通的好气色，闲时也以编织草鞋自娱，见了刘俊林还谢长谢短，夸说食堂好。然而，谁知道就在这座大山上，解放后，我们的干部上山来访贫问苦时，在这些空屋里曾经发现过不少全副尸骨摆在地上，人不知是什么时候竟活活地病饿而死了！……
    夜里，我在灯下翻看三川生产队写给县里的增产总结报告。这里面有不少的数字，每一个对比数字都在我眼前跳跃着，它们好像发出声音似地唱着欢乐的歌，让人读了又吃惊又兴奋。看着这材料，我的脑海里又浮现出刘俊林魁梧的身影，我仿佛觉得他已经开过了扩干会回到了三川，他又手持火把在深山里传送光明，把党的政策带给每个山村人家……。
    远处呜呜地传来火车的汽笛声，有一列火车又从宝成路上奔驰而过了。我想，我是等不得刘俊林散会了，明天清早我将先搭车到白水江车站，然后再翻过几座大山，我要早一点亲眼看看那阳光四射的三川的早晨……。
