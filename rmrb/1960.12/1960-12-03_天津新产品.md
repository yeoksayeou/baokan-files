Tianjin New Products

	Sewing Machine That Can Embroider
	The North China Sewing Machine Factory in Tianjin has recently begun mass production of a delicate and beautiful Five-One brand new household sewing machine. The body of this sewing machine is streamlined and painted sky blue. In addition to maintaining the advantages of the old sewing machine, it also has a new automatic drop-feed device. With just a flip of a switch, it can switch from sewing to embroidery. A dust-proof device has been added to the top of the machine head to prevent dust from entering the needle bar hole and wearing down the parts.

	Chinese Painting Carpet
	Lifelike Chinese paintings such as galloping horses, swimming fish, flying birds, and jumping shrimp are now appearing on tapestries. This Chinese painting carpet is a new product of the Tianjin carpet industry. The Chinese paintings now woven into tapestries include not only the birds and beasts painted by Qi Baishi and Xu Beihong, but also the famous large-scale Chinese painting "Ode to Peace" jointly painted by He Xiangning and other veteran artists. These Chinese painting carpets have fine wool and soft colors, and are carefully drawn and woven by highly skilled carpet workers.

	Photosensitive Printed Bed Sheets
	The patterns on bed sheets generally go through the process of plate making, flower brushing, and printing and dyeing, but the employees of Tianjin Zhenlian Printing and Dyeing Factory have recently produced a "photosensitive printed bed sheet." Its patterns are printed using a photographic photosensitive method. The printed bed sheets have realistic and delicate flower images, bright and uniform colors, and are not easy to fade. Using this method to print bed sheets is fast and can increase production.

	Flash Lamp
	Recently, the employees of the Tianjin Musical Instrument Factory successfully trial-produced a flash lamp for photography. After repeated photography and testing, the main performance indicators such as brightness and charging time have reached practical requirements. The factory is now stepping up the finalization and improvement of the operation, and is preparing for mass production.

	Ostrich Brand High-Grade Gold Pen
	The employees of the Tianjin Pen Factory, which has always only produced iridium pens with lower technical requirements, have produced the Ostrich brand high-grade gold pen this year under the slogan "Ostrich catches up with Hero". This gold pen writes smoothly and evenly from all five points: front, back, left, right, and top. Its appearance, water leakage temperature difference, continuous and intermittent writing performance are also very good. In the two official tests conducted in September and October, the total score of the Ostrich brand high-grade gold pen was only slightly lower than that of the Hero 100 gold pen, which won the national quality first prize last year.

    国画地毯
    奔马、游鱼、飞鸟、跳虾等栩栩如生的国画，现在出现在壁毯上了。这种国画地毯是天津市地毯业的新产品。现在已被织在壁毯上的国画，除了有齐白石、徐悲鸿画的飞禽走兽以外，还有何香凝等老画家合作绘成的著名大型国画“和平颂”等。这些国画地毯毛质细腻，色调柔和，都是由技术高的制毯工人精心地描绘和编织成的。
    感光印花床单
    床单上的花色，一般都经过制板、刷花、印染过程，而天津振联印染厂职工最近生产一种“感光印花床单”。它的花色是运用照相感光法射印上去的。印出来的床单，花的形象逼真细腻，色彩鲜艳匀称，而且不易掉色。采用这种方法射印床单，操作快，能提高产量。
    闪光灯
    最近天津乐器厂的职工试制成功了照相用的闪光灯。经过多次拍照与试验，亮度和充电时间等主要性能已经达到实用要求。现在这个厂正在加紧定型和改进操作，准备成批生产。
    鸵鸟牌高级金笔
    一直只生产技术要求较低的铱金笔的天津制笔厂职工，今年在“鸵鸟”赶“英雄”的口号下制出了鸵鸟牌高级金笔。这种金笔，从正、反、左、右、顶五处书写都圆滑细匀，它的外观，漏水温差，连续和间歇书写等性能也都很好。在九、十月份进行的两次正式测定中，鸵鸟牌高级金笔所得的总分，只比去年获得全国质量第一名的“英雄一○○”号金笔略差。
