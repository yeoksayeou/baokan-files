Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 2nd: A cold wave from Siberia is hitting Northeast China. Since late November, the Shenyang area has been covered in ice and snow, and the temperature has plummeted to minus fifteen degrees Celsius. In order to ensure smooth railway transportation during the winter, employees of the Shenyang Railway Bureau, under the slogan of "Enduring cold winds, resisting severe cold, breaking through three barriers, and fighting for steel and coal," are fighting day and night on thousands of miles of railway lines, enabling trains loaded with ore, coal, limestone, and other raw materials to safely and punctually break through the severe cold and head to Anshan Iron and Steel, supplying the needs of steel production.

In order to overcome the three major difficulties of safety, unloading, and shunting caused by the severe cold, the Shenyang Railway Bureau mobilized its subordinate stations and sections. More than 20 leading cadres, including the Party Committee Secretary, Bureau Director, and heads of various departments, went to key stations to supervise and inspect, and assist in solving problems. The relevant loading stations, transfer stations, and unloading stations personally control the allocation, coupling, transfer, loading, and unloading of vehicles heading to Anshan Iron and Steel, so as to transport various raw materials to Anshan Iron and Steel in a timely manner to ensure production needs. Train drivers, shunters, track maintenance workers, signal workers, vehicle maintenance workers, and other employees of each station and section also launched technical performance competitions to eliminate traffic accidents and improve transportation efficiency.

The Shenyang Railway Bureau also adopted the "three priorities" approach, giving priority to accepting, allocating, and loading materials needed by Anshan Iron and Steel. They organized various direct trains and circular trains from various raw material producing areas to Anshan. At the same time, the Railway Bureau and various stations, together with Anshan Iron and Steel and the relevant factories and mines supplying raw materials to Anshan Iron and Steel, formed a joint office to jointly prepare transportation plans based on the daily production of each factory and mine, so that the amount of raw materials produced by the raw materials department each day is transported to Anshan Iron and Steel. For materials that are prone to freezing, such as mineral powder and washed coal, in addition to prioritizing transportation, they also assist various raw material producing factories and mines in dehydration, dry refining, and ash addition to minimize the degree of freezing of these materials, making it easier for Anshan Iron and Steel to unload them.

As early as September this year, the Shenyang Railway Bureau began preparations for winter transportation. They mobilized thousands of employees to inspect locomotives, switches, and rail joints, and conducted winter operation training for more than 14,000 people. Therefore, in the days of ice, snow, and severe cold, the bureau has basically guaranteed the transportation of raw materials and supplies to Anshan Iron and Steel.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, December 2nd: During the recent cold wave that hit Anshan, the transportation department of Anshan Iron and Steel organized a loading and unloading team of more than 10,000 people, using more than 9,000 sets of thawing tools to vigorously rush to unload the raw materials and fuels frozen on the wagons, ensuring normal production. The loading and unloading efficiency has increased by about 10% compared with the same period last year.

Every winter, more than 60% of the raw materials and fuels transported to Anshan Iron and Steel from all over the country are frozen, causing difficulties in unloading and loading. This year, the Party Committee of Anshan Iron and Steel and the Party Committee of the Transportation Department implemented the principle of focusing on preventing freezing and supplementing with thawing, and began preparing for winter transportation, freeze prevention, and thawing work early on. On the one hand, they sent leading cadres to coal mines such as Hegang and Shuangyashan in Heilongjiang Province to jointly discuss freeze prevention measures; on the other hand, they mobilized employees of the enterprise to carry out technical innovations and technical revolutions, comprehensively inspected, appraised, and repaired all locomotives, trams, power machinery, and loading and unloading equipment, manufactured more than 9,000 sets of various thawing tools, transferred transportation loading and unloading workers to conduct winter freeze prevention and thawing training, and summarized and promoted advanced experience in freeze prevention and thawing. In order to strengthen the leadership of loading and unloading work, the company also established a winter transportation rush loading and unloading headquarters.

Recently, Anshan area suddenly experienced wind and snow, and the raw materials and fuels transported to Anshan Iron and Steel were frozen. More than 10,000 employees immediately joined the battle of rushing to load, unload, and transport. The loading and unloading workers at the storage yard used their own created thawing tools and advanced technology of blasting and thawing to unload the cars, shortening the time for unloading each car of frozen ore from eight hours to four hours. The employees of the coal bridge loading and unloading team improved their labor organization, concentrated their superior forces to quickly unload the cars, and unloaded a batch of coal cars in less than forty minutes, ensuring that the Chemical Plant had sufficient coking raw materials.

    及时运送原料保证鞍钢冬季生产
    沈阳铁路局职工顶冷风抗严寒安全正点运输
    鞍钢运输部门组织强大装卸队伍抢卸抢运
    新华社沈阳2日电　来自西伯利亚的寒流袭击着东北，11月下旬以来，沈阳地区冰雪封地，气温骤降到零下十五度。为了保证冬季铁路运输畅通，沈阳铁路局员工在“顶冷风、抗严寒、破三关、为钢煤而战”的口号下，日夜战斗在千里铁路线上，使一列列满载着矿石、煤炭、石灰石等原料的火车，安全正点地冲破严寒，奔向鞍钢，供应钢铁生产需要。
    为了战胜由严寒带来的安全、卸车、调车等三大困难，沈阳铁路局向所属站、段职工进行了动员，局党委书记、局长和各处处长等二十多名领导干部，都分赴各重点车站，督促检查，协助解决问题。各有关装车站、中转站、卸车站对开往鞍钢的车辆，都是由站长亲自掌握拨车、挂运、中转、装卸，以便把各种原材料及时运到鞍钢，保证生产需要。各站、段火车司机、调车、工务、电务、车辆等员工，还展开了技术表演赛，努力消灭行车事故，提高运输效率。
    沈阳铁路局还采取“三优先”的办法，优先受理、优先拨车、优先装运鞍钢所需的物资。他们从各原料产地到鞍山之间，编组了各种直达列车、循环列车。同时，铁路局和各车站分别与鞍钢及有关供应鞍钢原料的厂矿组成联合办公室，根据各厂矿每日生产情况共同编制运输计划，做到原料部门每天生产多少就为鞍钢运多少。对于矿粉、洗煤等易冻物资，他们除优先运输外，还协助各原料生产厂矿进行脱水、干炼、加灰，尽量减轻这些物资的冻结程度，便于鞍钢卸车。
    早在今年9月，沈阳铁路局就着手准备冬季运输。他们动员成千上万的员工检查了机车、道岔、钢轨接头，并且对一万四千多人进行了冬季作业训练。因而，在冰雪严寒的日子里，全局基本上保证了供应鞍钢原料物资的运输。
    新华社鞍山2日电　鞍山钢铁公司运输部门在最近寒流袭击鞍山期间，组织了一万多人的装卸队伍，使用九千多件解冻工具，大力抢卸冻结在车皮上的原料燃料，保证生产正常进行，装卸效率比去年同期提高10％左右。
    每年冬季，从全国各地运往鞍钢的原料、燃料有60％以上发生冻结现象，给卸车、装车造成困难。今年，鞍钢党委和运输部党委贯彻以防冻为主，以解冻为辅的方针，早就开始进行冬季运输防冻、解冻的准备工作。他们一面派领导干部到黑龙江省鹤岗、双鸭山等煤矿，共同商订防冻措施；一面发动本企业职工，开展技术革新和技术革命，对所有机车、电车、动力机械和装卸设备全面进行检查、鉴定和检修，制造各种解冻工具九千多件，抽调运输装卸工人进行冬季防冻解冻训练，总结和推广防冻、解冻的先进经验。为了加强装卸工作的领导，公司还成立了冬季运输抢装抢卸指挥部。
    最近，鞍山地区突降风雪，运到鞍钢的原料、燃料发生冻结，一万多名职工立即投入抢装抢卸抢运的战斗。贮料场的装卸工人，运用自己创造的解冻工具和爆破解冻卸车的先进技术，使每卸一车被冻矿石的时间，由八小时缩短到四小时。煤桥装卸队的职工，改进劳动组织，集中优势力量快速卸车，不到四十分钟就卸完一批煤车，保证了化工总厂有充足的炼焦原料。（附图片）
