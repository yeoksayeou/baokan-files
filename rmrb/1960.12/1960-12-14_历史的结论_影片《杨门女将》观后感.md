    Historical Conclusion
    ——Reflections on the Film "The Heroic Sons and Daughters"
    Ban Fu
    The war drums shook the earth, the Tartar horns blared to the heavens. Yang Zongbao, Marshal of the Song Dynasty, was killed by a hidden arrow from the invading Western Xia army. King Wang Wenzheng of Western Xia, filled with murderous intent, led his army to press upon the borders of the Song Dynasty...

    "Iron cavalry encircles the border, taking the Central Plains is just around the corner." This King of Western Xia, who launched an unjust war, can only be described as extremely rampant at the time.

    The arrogance of the King of Western Xia did indeed have a considerable effect on those Song court officials who were only concerned with preserving their own lives and positions, and who completely disregarded the fate of the country and the nation. Wasn't Wang Hui, the state minister who called himself "experienced in risks throughout his life, and infallible in everything," saying that "the bandit soldiers are currently full of vigor and difficult to resist," and that Emperor Renzong should "seek peace temporarily (which is actually surrender) to ensure complete safety"? The generals who "used to compete to ascend the Dragon Court for rewards and promotions," when the country needed them most, weren't they all afraid of losing their heads, "feigning deafness and dumbness" and不敢领兵去却敌（不敢领兵去却敌）not daring to lead troops to repel the enemy? Even Emperor Renzong, the supreme ruler at the time, was frightened and planned to conclude a shameful treaty of surrender...

    For thousands of years, the people have always regarded these clowns on the historical stage as negative examples to be ridiculed and castigated. "Infamy for ten thousand years" is the severe conclusion that history has drawn for them.

    True heroes cannot be intimidated.

    At a time when the country's survival was at stake, in an era of turmoil, the Yang family women, led by She Taijun, regardless of their own heavy sacrifices, turned grief into strength, stepped forward bravely, and waged a resolute struggle against the surrender faction. She Taijun, despite her advanced age of one hundred years, requested to take command and eliminate the enemy. The scene in "The Mourning Hall" is extremely well-written. In this scene, the heroic twelve widows of the Yang family, faced with the immense misfortune of losing their husbands and sons, were not overwhelmed by grief or chanting mournful dirges. Instead, they represented the will of the people and, in front of the dim-witted and incompetent Emperor Renzong, sang the earth-shattering battle song of "Set out! Set out! Set out quickly!"

    When Wang Hui, the representative of the surrender faction, did everything possible to obstruct Taijun from going to war, saying that "...if the old Taijun does not fail against Western Xia this time, this official is willing to remove this official hat and, from now on, for three generations, my descendants will never serve in the court," the old Taijun said to him with great contempt: "My Yang family only knows how to serve the country with loyalty, what official hats are there to remove?"; and again requested Emperor Renzong to make a decisive decision and allow her to take command and go to war.

    It was precisely because of the Yang family generals' gallantry on the battlefield, their risking of life and limb, that the country was able to turn danger into safety, and the people were able to avoid the misfortune of wearing their hair loose and fastening their clothes on the left. When they returned in triumph, the Yang family generals sang, "The pines and cypresses are evergreen and the flowers are luxuriant, look at the country's stalwart pillar, a family of heroes!" This song was approved by the people, it was the voice of the people. The Yang family generals will be remembered for thousands of years, and this is also a just conclusion of history.

    Our Chinese nation is a nation that loves peace, but it is also a brave nation with rich revolutionary traditions. Since ancient times, "the people of all ethnic groups in the Chinese nation have opposed the oppression of foreign nations and have used resistance to lift this oppression." The people of all ethnic groups in our Chinese nation are not to be insulted. Anyone who dares to wield knives and clubs against our great Chinese people, the shameful end of King Wang Wenzheng of Western Xia in "The Heroic Sons and Daughters" is the best lesson for him.

    In the current film, compared to "A Hundred Years in Command" (originally titled "The Twelve Widows' Campaign to the West"), a medicinal herb-collecting old man has been added. This character has been added very well. He expresses the deep love of the broad masses of the people for the Yang family generals, and played a great role in Mu Guiying, Yang Wenguang, and others finding the plank road, attacking the enemy camp, and achieving the final victory of the war. Through vivid artistic images, the author irrefutably proves that because the Yang family generals were waging a just war against aggression, they were supported and supported by the broad masses of the people, which was the fundamental reason why the Yang family generals were able to defeat a strong enemy and achieve victory; while King Wang Wenzheng of Western Xia launched an unjust war – an unjust war, so he was bound to be strongly opposed by the people, so the enemy ran rampant for a short time before being burned to death in the raging fire of the people's just war.

    "An unjust army, how can it not be defeated!" This is another correct conclusion of history.

    The Yang family generals are a historical story. On the question of how to write historical stories in literary and artistic works, there is a struggle between two lines. The bourgeoisie writes historical plays in order to "arouse nostalgic sentiments," praising the past and negating the present, attempting to distort the true face of history, tamper with the correct conclusions of history, and hinder social progress. The film "The Life of Wu Xun" is a typical example. Proletarian artists write historical plays in order to reveal the true face of historical development through beautiful artistic images, to tell the correct conclusions of history to the people of today, to cultivate people's revolutionary historical materialist point of view, to "develop a new national culture and enhance national self-confidence," and to serve the current socialist politics. "The Heroic Sons and Daughters" has achieved undeniable success in this regard.

    The conclusions of history are solemn, but they are also fair, because no matter when, it is always the great people who hold the pen of praise and blame in history.

    历史的结论
    ——影片《杨门女将》观后感
    班斧
    鼙鼓动地，胡笳喧天，宋朝元帅杨宗保被西夏侵略军暗箭射死，西夏王王文正杀气腾腾地率领大军向宋朝边关压来……
    “铁骑困边关，指日取中原”，这位发动不义之师的西夏王在当时不能不说是猖狂已极。
    西夏王的猖狂，对于当时宋廷中那些只图保存自己的生命权位、完全不顾祖国与民族命运的败类来说，确收到了不小的效果。自称为“一生饱经风险，凡事万无一失”的国家大臣王辉，不是说“如今贼兵锐气方张，难于力敌”，要仁宗“不如暂时求和（其实就是投降），以保万全”吗？“往日里封赏把爵晋，争先恐后上龙廷”的将军们，在祖国最需要的时候，不都是怕丢掉了自己的脑袋，“装聋作哑”不敢领兵去却敌吗？就连当时的最高统治者仁宗也被吓破了胆，打算与敌人订立可耻的城下之盟了……
    这些历史舞台上的小丑，千年来，人民一直把他们当作反面教员来加以嘲笑与鞭挞。“遗臭万年”，这是历史给他们作下的严峻的结论。
    真正的英雄是吓不倒的。
    在祖国生死存亡之际，风雨飘摇之秋，以佘太君为首的杨门女将却不管自家牺牲多么惨重，化悲痛为力量，挺身而出，与投降派作面对面的坚决的斗争。佘太君并以百岁高龄要求挂帅出征，消灭敌人。《灵堂》一场写得极为成功。在这一场戏里，英雄的杨门十二寡妇面对着丧夫失子的巨大的不幸，不但没有被悲痛压倒，低吟凄楚哀怨的挽曲，反而代表了人民的意志，在昏瞆无能的仁宗面前，唱出了惊天动地的“出征！出征！快出征！”的战歌。
    当投降派的代表人物王辉百般阻挠太君出征，说什么“……老太君此番出兵，若不败于西夏，下官情愿摘下这顶乌纱帽，从今以后，子孙三世永不入朝为官”的时候，老太君就十分鄙视地对他说：“我杨家只知忠心报国，那有乌纱可摘”；并再次请求仁宗当机立断，准许她挂帅出征。
    正由于杨家将的驰骋沙场，出生入死，祖国始得转危为安，人民始得避免披发左衽的厄运。凯旋回朝的时候，杨家将唱着“松柏长青花繁茂，看国家干城一门英雄！”这个唱词是人民批准的，是人民的心声。杨家将留芳千古，也是历史的公正的结论。
    我们中华民族是酷爱和平的民族，但也是勇敢的富于革命传统的民族。自古以来，“中华民族的各族人民都反对外来民族的压迫，都要用反抗的手段解除这种压迫。”我们中华民族的各族人民都是不可侮的。那一个人要敢对我们伟大的中国人民舞刀弄棍，那《杨门女将》中西夏王王文的可耻的下场，正是他的最好的前车之鉴。
    现在这个影片里，较之《百岁挂帅》（原名《十二寡妇征西》）增加了一个采药老人。这个人物增加得很好。他表达了当时广大的人民对杨家将的爱戴之情，并在穆桂英、杨文广等寻找栈道、袭击敌营、取得战争最后胜利的这一方面，起了很大的作用。作者通过生动的艺术形象，无可争辩地证明了由于杨家将是在进行反对侵略的正义的战争，因此受到广大人民的拥护与支持，这是杨家将能战胜强敌、取得胜利的根本原因；而西夏王王文发动的是不义之师——非正义的战争，因此必然遭到人民强有力的反对，所以敌人横行不久，就被烧死在人民正义战争的熊熊烈火之中了。
    “不义之师，焉得不败！”这是历史的又一正确的结论。
    杨家将是历史故事。在文艺作品如何写历史故事的问题上，是存在着两条道路的斗争的。资产阶级写历史戏，是为了“发思古之幽情”，颂古非今，妄图歪曲历史的真实面貌，篡改历史的正确的结论，阻碍社会前进。电影《武训传》就是个典型的例子。无产阶级的艺术家写历史戏，则是为了通过美的艺术形象，揭示历史的发展真实面貌，把历史的正确的结论告诉给现在的人民，培养人们的革命的历史唯物主义的观点，“发展民族新文化提高民族自信心”，为当前的社会主义政治服务。《杨门女将》在这方面取得了不容忽视的成就。
    历史的结论是严正的，但也是公平的，因为不论在什么时候，掌握着青史褒贬之笔的总是伟大的人民。
