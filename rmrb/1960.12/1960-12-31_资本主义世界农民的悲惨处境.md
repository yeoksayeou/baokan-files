The Miserable Plight of Farmers in the Capitalist World

    United States: One Farmer Leaves the Countryside Every Five Minutes

    The situation of American farmers is deteriorating daily. A news item in the December 14th issue of the *Wall Street Journal* stated: "The average net income per farm is now about 14% less than in 1951, and farmers are leaving the countryside at a rate of one every five minutes."

    The farmers forced to leave the countryside at a rate of "one every five minutes" are, of course, small and medium-sized farmers. Due to the deepening agricultural crisis in the United States and the mergers by agricultural monopoly organizations, the agricultural population in the United States has shrunk considerably. According to official materials, the agricultural population in the United States accounted for 18% of the total population in 1954, but had dropped to 9% in 1959.

    However, agricultural monopoly organizations and the American government, which represents their interests, are intensifying their attacks on small and medium-sized farmers. At a recent meeting of the Agricultural Bureau, the Agricultural Bureau's proposal committee advocated that the Secretary of Agriculture should annually decide how much land should be left idle. At a meeting, the National Agricultural Policy Committee said that the first step in reducing surplus corn and other feed should be for each feed farmer to leave at least 20% of their arable land idle.

    France: 160,000 Farmers Forced to Leave Their Homes in One Year

    "A hundred years from now, France may no longer have agricultural cultivators, because French farmers are aging and dying quickly. Twenty-three out of every hundred people are farmers, but they are slowly losing interest in farming. Eighty thousand or even more people leave the fields every year, all of them young people, and no one is replacing them. 88% of farmers live to be just over thirty-five years old. Some provinces have land that is completely barren." These alarming words were written in an article in the French bourgeois newspaper *Le Parisien Libéré*, reflecting the current miserable plight of French farmers.

    Since de Gaulle came to power, he has implemented a series of measures that only benefit monopoly groups and large farm owners, leaving 800,000 small French farmers on the verge of bankruptcy. The prices of French industrial products are constantly rising, and urban food prices are rising even faster, but the income that farmers receive from selling agricultural products is pitifully small. Large companies operating in agriculture make profits of double or even several times over in a single transaction, making a fortune, while the number of farmers who have had to move to the cities to make a living because of losing their land has reached 160,000 from last year to this year.

    West Germany: Over 900,000 Farm Households Face a Future of Ruin

    Adenauer's government's "Green Plan" has led a large number of small and medium-sized farmers in West Germany down the road to ruin.

    According to the "Green Plan" implemented by the Bonn government this year to "change the agricultural structure" within twenty years, "the Federal Republic should only have and retain about 800,000 farm households." At the beginning of this year, the total number of farm households in West Germany was more than 1.74 million. In other words, more than 900,000 farm households will be merged by agricultural monopoly organizations within twenty years.

    According to materials published by the Bonn government, the number of farm households in West Germany has decreased by 220,000 since 1948. This year, the rate of bankruptcy of small and medium-sized farm households has accelerated. According to documents published in the Black Book of the German Unification Committee, about one hundred small farmers in West Germany are forced to abandon their land every day.

    Italy: Agricultural Production Declines, Farmers' Incomes Decrease

    Italy's production of most agricultural products has decreased this year. Compared with last year, wheat production has decreased by 19%, rye production has decreased by 11.3%, barley production has decreased by 16.6%, and oat production has decreased by 19.9%.

    According to recent estimates, Italy's total national agricultural income may decrease by 4% this year compared to last year. This is the second consecutive year of decline for Italian agriculture after the decline in 1959.

    Due to the decline in agricultural production, the situation of farmers continues to deteriorate. According to statistics, farmers' incomes average less than half of the income from other types of labor, although the incomes of other workers in Italy are also much lower than in many other capitalist countries. In 1959, 600,000 farmers in Italy flowed into the cities, and the situation is not expected to improve this year.

    Greece: Large Numbers of Farmers Flee Abroad in Droves

    Greek farmers, facing hardship due to government extortion and severe natural disasters, are forced to flee abroad in droves, bringing their elderly and children. According to a recent report in *Avgi* (Dawn) newspaper, in the area of Drama alone, 4,000 people have migrated to foreign countries to find work. Many are leaving with their families.

    The newspaper described this scene of exodus, saying: "The residents of various places, as if struck by cholera, are flocking to the towns, demanding passports to go abroad in a frenzy."

    *Avgi* pointed out that Greek farmers are being hit by severe natural disasters while being crushed by exorbitant taxes. The newspaper said that in the Drama region, tobacco crops were hit by hail, and production is estimated to be reduced by three-quarters. It is estimated that only 300,000 okes (a Greek unit of weight) of tobacco leaves can be harvested this year, compared to last year's production of 1.2 million okes.

    *Avgi* said that Greek farmers are worried that "the Greek government's anti-people economic policies risk turning the Greek countryside into a vast wasteland."

### 资本主义世界农民的悲惨处境

    资本主义世界农民的悲惨处境
    美国：每五分钟一个农民流出农村
    美国农民处境日益恶化。12月14日《华尔街日报》的一则新闻写道：“现在平均每个农庄的净收入比1951年约减少14％，而且农民正以每五分钟一个人的速度流出农村。”
    以“五分钟一个人的速度”被迫离开农村的农民，当然只是中小农户。由于美国农业危机的加深和农业垄断组织的兼并，美国农业人口大量缩减，据官方材料：美国农业人口1954年占总人口的18％，1959年已降为9％。
    但是，农业垄断组织和代表他们利益的美国政府还正在加紧对中小农户的进攻。在最近农业局召开的会议上，农业局提案委员会主张农业部长应每年决定有多少土地应当闲置起来。全国农业政策委员会在一次会议上说，减少剩余玉米和其他饲料的第一步应当是每个种饲料的农民至少把耕田闲置20％。
    法国：一年中十六万农民被迫离乡
    “一百年之后，法国可能不再有农业耕耘者，因为，法国农民由于衰老得快也死亡得快。一百人中有二十三个是农民，但是他们慢慢都不想种地了。每年离开田地的有八万人甚至更多，都是青年，没有人再接替他们。88％的耕农活到三十五岁多一些。有些省土地全部荒芜”。这段骇人听闻的话是法国资产阶级报纸《解放了的巴黎人报》在一篇文章中所写的，这反映了法国农民目前悲惨的处境。
    戴高乐政府上台后，实行了一系列仅仅有利于垄断集团和大农场主的措施，使法国的八十万小农濒于破产。法国工业品价格不断上升，城市食品价格涨得更快，但是农民出售农产品的所得却少得可怜。经营农业的大公司一转手之间获利一倍甚至数倍，大发横财，而因失去土地不得不流入城市谋生的农民，从去年到今年就已经有十六万人。
    西德：九十多万农户面临毁灭前景
    阿登纳政府的“绿色计划”，使西德大批中小农民走上毁灭的道路。
    按波恩政府在今年开始实行的在二十年内“改变农业结构”的“绿色计划”，“联邦共和国只应存在和保留约八十万个农户”。而今年年初，西德农户总数为一百七十四万多户。也就是说，在二十年中将有九十多万个农户被农业垄断组织兼并。
    根据波恩官方公布的材料，从1948年以来，西德农户已减少了二十二万户。而今年，中小农户破产的速度更加快了。据德国统一委员会黑皮书发表的文件表明，西德每天大约有一百个小农被迫放弃自己的土地。
    意大利：农业产量下降农民收入减少
    意大利今年大部分农产品减产。与去年相比，小麦产量下降了19％，黑麦产量下降了11.3％，大麦产量下降了16.6％，燕麦产量下降了19.9％。
    据最近预计，今年意大利全国农业总收入可能比去年减少4％。这是意大利农业继1959年下降后的第二年下降。
    由于农业减产，农民处境不断恶化。据统计，农民的收入平均不到从事其它劳动的收入的二分之一，虽然意大利其它劳动者的收入也大大低于其它很多资本主义国家。1959年意大利有六十万农民流入城市，今年估计情况也不会好转。
    希腊：大批农民成群结队流亡国外
    希腊农民在政府横征暴敛和严重天灾的困境下，被迫扶老携幼成群结队流亡国外。据《黎明日报》最近报道，仅仅在特拉马一地，就有四千人迁往外国去找工作。许多携带家眷一起走。
    这家报纸描绘这种流亡图景说：“各地的居民好像受到霍乱的打击一样，成群地来到城镇，发狂似地要求得到出国护照。”
    《黎明日报》指出，希腊农民在被苛捐杂税压得喘不过气的同时又遭到严重的自然灾害的打击。报纸说，在特拉马地方，烟草遭受冰雹袭击，估计减产四分之三。今年大约只能收获三十万奥克（希腊重量单位）烟叶，而去年的产量为一百二十万奥克。
    《黎明日报》说，希腊农民担心，“希腊政府这种反人民的经济政策有把希腊农村变成茫茫荒漠的危险”。
