(Reported by this newspaper from Guangzhou on December 8th) Dongken Brigade (i.e., the basic accounting unit) of Hengli Commune, Dongguan County, Guangdong Province, resolutely implemented the Party's various policies and fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the small team cadres and the broad masses of commune members. They not only greatly reduced the losses caused by the flood, but also achieved an overall increase in grain and diversified economic income.

Dongken Brigade is located in a hilly area, prone to both floods and droughts. This year, just after the late rice seedlings were transplanted, they encountered three heavy rains in a row. The commune members persisted in fighting the disaster, planting and then being submerged, being submerged and then planting again. However, half of the brigade's more than two thousand mu of rice fields were still flooded. After the disaster, in order to strengthen the masses' confidence in overcoming the disaster, the Party General Branch analyzed the favorable conditions for regaining the losses caused by the disaster and put forward the action slogan: "Recoup the losses in the paddy fields from the dry fields, recoup the losses in the irrigated fields from the dry land, recoup the losses in the staple food from the coarse grains, and recoup the losses in agriculture from the sideline occupations," leading the commune members to carry out a production and disaster relief campaign.

In order to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the small team cadres and the broad masses of commune members, they adopted four measures: First, they reasonably adjusted the "three guarantees" targets for the late crop based on the disaster situation. The brigade organized experienced farmers and small team cadres to go to the fields to assess the disaster situation of the rice fields plot by plot. Among the 1,100 mu of rice fields affected by the disaster, except for 190 mu where the losses were not significant and the production target was not adjusted, the production target for 200 mu was reduced by 20%, the production target for 400 mu was reduced by 40%; and for the 310 mu where the seedlings had been completely submerged, if replanting was possible, the production target would be reduced by 80%, and if replanting was not possible, there would be no production target. The masses were very satisfied after these production targets were reasonably adjusted. Second, the brigade also promptly implemented the "three guarantees" targets for coarse grains with each small team. The brigade assigned the contract to each small team based on the usual area and yield of coarse grains, with rewards for overproduction. Most of the income from exceeding the contracted planting area was to be distributed by the small team. Third, actively run the canteens well and arrange for the livelihood of the commune members. The brigade sent cadres to the two most backward canteens in Dongchong and Shigouqian to help the small teams run the canteens well. On the other hand, they helped the small team canteens develop family production. Fourth, they encouraged commune members to manage their private plots and household sideline occupations well on the premise of doing a good job in collective production. The brigade rationally arranged working hours so that commune members had a certain amount of time to manage their private plots. At the same time, the brigade lent more than 5,000 goslings to the commune members to raise.

After the Dongken Brigade did this, the production enthusiasm of the cadres and commune members of each small team was fully utilized, and rice, coarse grains, diversified economy, canteen production, and household sideline occupations were all developed. Each small team first sent 450 people to pump water and drain the floods, actively replanting the submerged fields, planting and harvesting as they drained. All rice fields that were not submerged were managed as high-yield fields, and measures were taken to increase production. For the high-yield fields that were not affected by the disaster, each small team further intensified management. The enthusiasm of each small team to expand the planting of coarse grains was even higher. As soon as the meeting for signing the "three guarantees" contract ended, the Dongchong small team sent commune members to reclaim wasteland on Songlinggang that night, reclaiming 18 mu in one go, and planting all sweet potato seedlings the next day. A wave of early planting and increased planting of coarse grains was formed, and all the small hills, walls, field edges, and corners were planted with coarse grains, exceeding the task of contracting coarse grains by one time. After the rice field weeding was slightly less busy, each small team concentrated 60% of the labor force to strengthen the field management of economic crops. Sugar cane and peanuts were all earthed up and weeded. Sideline production was also immediately launched. The agricultural, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery production of the entire brigade was vigorously carried out. All 290 mu of private plots of the entire brigade were planted with various coarse grains such as sweet potatoes, soybeans, foxtail millet, and pumpkins, and vegetables were also intercropped.

After more than two months of hard work, the Dongken Brigade not only reduced the losses caused by the flood, but also achieved an overall increase in grain and diversified economic income. Of the 1,100 mu of paddy fields affected by the disaster, except for the 310 mu that could not be replanted due to submersion, the average yield per mu of the remaining was more than 300 jin. Due to the reduction of area caused by the flood, the total output of rice was still reduced by 6% compared with last year. This year's area of coarse grains such as sweet potatoes and cassava was doubled compared with last year, and the unit yield was also high, resulting in a bumper harvest. In addition to completing 90% of the task of selling pigs, the number of pigs in stock in October increased by more than five times compared with the beginning of this year. Pond fish completed the listing task every month. Due to increased production and income, the commune members said: "It doesn't look like we have suffered from a disaster at all!" (Attached picture)

Xinhua News Agency reporter Luo Qing photographed the scene of Zhangshi Commune in the suburbs of Shaoguan City, Guangdong Province, vigorously developing poultry production after the disaster. The number of chickens, ducks, and geese increased by 30% compared with before the disaster.

    采取各项积极措施　坚定群众抗灾信心
    东坑大队稻谷减产杂粮增收
    本报广州8日电　广东省东莞县横沥公社东坑大队（即基本核算单位），坚决执行党的各项政策，把小队干部和广大社员的积极性充分调动起来，不仅大大减轻了涝灾的损失，而且实现了粮食和多种经济全面增产增收。
    东坑大队地处丘陵地带，易涝、易旱。今年晚造（即晚季）刚插下秧，就一连遇到三次暴雨。社员们坚持抗灾中，插了又浸，浸了又插。但是，全大队二千多亩稻田，受淹的仍有一半。受灾以后，党总支为了坚定群众战胜灾害的信心，分析了夺回受灾损失的有利条件，提出了：“埔田的损失从坑田夺回，水田的损失从旱地夺回，主粮的损失从杂粮夺回，农业的损失从副业夺回”的行动口号，领导社员开展生产救灾运动。
    为了把小队干部和广大社员的积极性充分调动起来，他们采取了四项措施：首先，根据受灾情况，合理调整晚造“三包”指标。大队组织老农、小队干部到田，逐片评定稻田灾情。在受灾的一千一百亩稻田中，除了一百九十亩损失不大，包产指标不再调整以外，有二百亩包产指标降低20％，有四百亩包产指标降低40％；还有三百一十亩禾苗已经全部浸死，如果能够重插，包产指标则降低80％，如果不能重插，不包产量。这些经过合理调整了包产指标后，群众都很满意。其次，大队还及时和各小队落实杂粮“三包”指标，大队按杂粮的常年面积和产量，分给各小队承包，超产提成奖励，超过包种面积的收入，大部分归小队支配。第三，积极办好食堂，安排好社员生活。大队一方面派了干部到东冲、石狗前两个最落后的食堂去，帮助小队把食堂办好；另一方面帮助小队食堂发展家底生产。第四，鼓励社员在搞好集体生产的前提下，经营好自留地和家庭副业。合理安排劳动时间，让社员有一定的时间经营自留地，同时，大队还贷出了五千多只鹅苗给社员饲养。
    东坑大队这样做了以后，各小队干部和社员的生产积极性都充分发挥起来，水稻、杂粮、多种经济、食堂生产和家庭副业都有了发展。各小队首先派出四百五十人车水排涝，积极补插受浸田，干一块插一块，争取早种多收；对没有受浸的稻田，全部当作高产田来经营，大加增产措施；对没有受灾的高产田，各小队更是加工管理。各小队扩种杂粮的积极性更高，签订“三包”合同会议一结束，东冲小队当晚就派出社员到松岭岗开荒，一气开垦了十八亩，次日全部栽上薯苗。早种、多种杂粮形成热潮，所有的小山岗、墙边、田头、地角都种满了杂粮，超额一倍完成包种杂粮的任务。在稻田中耕稍闲以后，各小队又集中了60％的劳动力，加强经济作物田间管理，甘蔗、花生全部培了土，除净草。副业生产也立即开展起来。全大队的农、牧、副、渔各业生产都蓬勃地开展了。全大队二百九十亩自留地都种满了番薯、黄豆、狗尾粟与南瓜等各种杂粮，还间种了蔬菜。
    东坑大队经过两个多月的奋战，不仅减轻了涝灾损失，而且实现了粮食和多种经济全面增产增收。受灾的一千一百亩水稻，除了浸死的三百一十亩无法补插以外，其余平均亩产量在三百斤以上。由于涝灾减少了面积，因而稻谷总产量仍比去年减产6％。今年的番薯、木薯等杂粮面积比去年扩大了一倍，单位产量也高，获得了丰收。猪除了完成交售任务90％以外，10月的存栏量比今年初增长了五倍多。塘鱼每月都完成上市任务。由于增产增收，社员们都说：“完全不像受过灾的样子！”（附图片）
