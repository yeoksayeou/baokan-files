Xinhua Daily News: The Party Committee of Changzhou Minfeng Textile Factory in Jiangsu Province adopted a two-pronged approach of strengthening ideological and political work and technical management, comprehensively implementing the production policy of high quality, high yield, low consumption, and safety. In November, the amount of cotton used per yarn piece was reduced to 379.72 jin, saving more than 15,700 jin of cotton. The total monthly yarn production exceeded the plan by 12%, and the standard product rate and the top-grade first-class rate both reached 100%.

In November, the factory's Party committee conducted in-depth education on cotton conservation for employees. They calculated that, under the premise of improving the quality of cotton yarn, fully utilizing effective fibers in every process from opening and cleaning to spinning, reducing the amount of cotton used per yarn piece by two jin would save about 60 dan of cotton per month. This could spin 16 yarn pieces, weave more than 600 bolts of cloth, and provide enough cloth for 4,200 people to make a set of clothes each. This made the employees realize the great significance of saving every bit of cotton and every flower. At the same time, they also used the trial spinning of new cotton to illustrate with concrete facts that this year's cotton has fewer knots and impurities and good strength, so effective fibers can be fully utilized, and the requirements of high quality, high yield, low consumption, and safety can be fully achieved in production, which improved everyone's confidence. The employees put forward the slogan of "Saving every white flower, every white flower spins good yarn," and everyone formulated cotton-saving targets and enthusiastically launched competitions.

In order to better achieve the goal of using less cotton and spinning better yarn, the factory vigorously strengthened technical management. From the moment raw cotton entered the factory, trial spinning was implemented, and then the process design was determined. From semi-finished products to finished products entering the warehouse, every level was checked, and various technical management systems were strictly implemented. For example, in the opening and cleaning workshop, they insisted on small-batch cotton mixing to ensure uniform matching of fineness, length, and maturity, fully utilize effective fibers, and ensure the quality of cotton laps to meet the needs of carding machine production. At the same time, they also continuously summarized and promoted advanced operating experience to help workers improve their operating skills, so that various technical management measures could be smoothly implemented.

Due to the strengthening of ideological and political work and technical management, the employees' enthusiasm for production has also increased. Everyone is striving to use less cotton and spin more good yarn. In the three-shift competition, opening and cleaning workers cooperated to reduce the web spacing of the opening and cleaning machine. Based on the characteristics of less impurities in the cotton, the number of combing knives on the opening and cleaning machine was changed from four to three, reducing the cotton waste rate of the opening and cleaning machine from 2% to 1.3%, increasing the impurity removal efficiency to 80%, and the lap regularity rate reached about 99.5%. This allowed effective fibers to be used in production, greatly reducing raw cotton loss in production. Zhang Xiaomei, an elderly female worker on the carding machine, created an advanced operation method of left-right threading in response to the key issue of excessive cotton waste. After this advanced experience was promoted throughout the factory, the daily cotton waste on the carding machine was reduced from 2,000 jin to 600 jin, which not only ensured the supply of good cotton slivers to the subsequent process but also saved cotton.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou: Workers at the Shuiye Cotton Stalk Skin Processing Factory in Anyang City, Henan Province, used cotton stalk skin to make a large number of durable textiles. Since the beginning of this year, the factory has produced a total of 690,000 chi of various fabrics made from cotton stalk skin, including cotton bale cloth, canvas, and herringbone twill.

This year, the factory closely cooperated with the local Yubei Cotton Textile Factory to conduct experiments on blending fine-count yarn with cotton stalk skin and waste cotton. Many difficulties were overcome during the experiment, and finally, relatively good yarn was spun. Then, the workers used this yarn to weave flower bale cloth, canvas, bed sheets, herringbone twill, and other products. Although these fabrics appear coarser than cotton cloth on the surface, they are strong and durable, and very suitable for making work clothes, gloves, aprons, and other labor protection products. The Zhongshan suits made of herringbone twill are of similar quality to khaki, and the masses love them very much.

### 人人树立节约观念　道道工序加强管理  民丰纺织厂少用棉花多纺好纱  水冶棉秆皮加工厂职工用棉秆皮制成大量耐用的纺织品

    人人树立节约观念　道道工序加强管理
    民丰纺织厂少用棉花多纺好纱
    水冶棉秆皮加工厂职工用棉秆皮制成大量耐用的纺织品
    本报讯　据新华日报消息：江苏省常州市民丰纺织厂党委采取加强思想政治工作和技术管理双管齐下的办法，全面贯彻执行优质、高产、低耗又安全的生产方针，11月份每件纱的用棉量减少到三百七十九点七二斤，节约棉花一万五千七百多斤，使全月棉纱总产量超过计划12％，标准品率和上等一级品率都达到100％。
    11月份，这个厂党委深入地对职工进行了节约用棉的教育。他们算了一笔账：在提高棉纱质量的前提下，从清花到细纱的每道工序都充分利用有效纤维，每件棉纱的用棉量减少两斤，每月就可节约棉花六十担左右，可纺十六件纱，织六百多匹布，能够供给四千二百多人每人做一套衣服，从而使职工们认识到节约一丝棉、一朵花的重大意义。同时，他们又通过新棉的试纺，用具体事实说明今年棉结杂质少、强力好，可以充分利用有效纤维，在生产上完全可以达到优质、高产、低耗又安全的要求，提高了大家的信心。职工们提出了“节约每一朵白花，朵朵白花纺好纱”的口号，每个人都制订节约用棉的指标，热烈地开展竞赛。
    为了更好地做到少用棉花、多纺好纱，这个厂大力加强了技术管理。从原棉一进厂，就实行试纺，然后确定工艺设计。从半制品到成品入库，道道把关，严格执行技术管理上的各项制度。如在清花车上，他们坚持小量混棉，做到细度、长度、成熟度搭配均匀，充分运用有效纤维，保证棉卷的质量，供应钢丝车生产的需要。同时，他们又不断总结和推广先进操作经验，帮助工人提高操作技术水平，使技术管理上的各项措施得到顺利贯彻。
    由于思想政治工作和技术管理工作的加强，职工们的生产积极性也越来越高，大家争着少用棉花多纺好纱。在三班竞赛中，清花工人通力协作把清花车的成网夹距改小，并根据棉花含杂少的特点，把清花车上的梳棉刀由四把改为三把，使清花车的落棉率由2％降低到1.3％，除杂效率提高到80％，棉卷的正卷率达到99.5％左右，这就使有效纤维都用到生产上去，大大减少了生产中的原棉损耗。钢丝车上的老年女工张小妹针对回花多的关键，创造了左右穿头的先进操作法，这一先进经验在全厂推广后，使钢丝车上每天的回花由二千斤减少到六百斤，既保证了好棉条供应后道工序，又节约了棉花。
    据新华社郑州电　河南省安阳市水冶棉秆皮加工厂职工，用棉秆皮制成大量耐用的纺织品。今年以来，用棉秆皮生产的棉花包布、帆布、人字呢等各种布匹共达六十九万尺。
    今年这个工厂同当地的豫北棉纺织厂密切协作，进行了棉秆皮和废棉混纺细支纱的试验。试验过程中克服了许多困难，终于纺成了比较好的纱。接着工人们又用这种纱先后织成花包布、帆布、床单、人字呢等产品。这些布匹虽然从表面看来比棉布粗糙，但质地坚固，很适于做工作服、手套、围裙等劳动保护用品；用人字呢做成的中山服，质量和卡其布不相上下，群众很是喜爱。
