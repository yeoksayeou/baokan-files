Heilongjiang Actively Transfers Agricultural Timber Outward

(Reported by this newspaper) Under the guidance of the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation, Heilongjiang Province has completed the production plan for rural timber needed for bridges, vehicles, boats, power poles, water conservancy, and small farm tools in advance. In addition to meeting the needs of the province's rural areas, these timbers have also been transported to twelve provinces (regions) and cities, including Shandong, Henan, Ningxia, Jiangsu, Shanxi, Liaoning, Beijing, and Tianjin, to support agricultural production.

In the production of rural timber, Heilongjiang Province adopted a three-pronged approach. Forest industrial enterprises, state-owned farms, and people's communes in timber-producing areas all undertook production tasks. Everyone worked together to produce whatever was needed, based on the needs. Forest industrial enterprises mainly produced special timber for rural use, and also combined logging to produce small-sized materials. State-owned farms and people's communes in timber-producing areas mainly carried out tending and thinning and branch trimming in conjunction with the transformation and cultivation of forests, mainly to produce timber for small farm tools. A total of more than 7.55 million pieces of small farm tool timber have been produced, including: more than 30,000 plow beams, 600,000 wooden forks, 1.5 million carrying poles, and more than 5.42 million handles for various farm tools such as hoes, shovels, and picks.

In order to strengthen the leadership of this work, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee successively convened two special meetings to study and deploy the work. The relevant special districts and counties, according to the spirit of the provincial party committee's instructions, organized forestry, agriculture, commerce and other relevant departments, and established agricultural timber production offices to specifically guide this production and solve various specific problems in production. Various localities also carried out publicity and education activities on the great significance of producing rural timber and supporting agriculture, so that the broad masses of workers and commune members actively invested in this production movement and regarded it as a glorious political task.

    林场、农场和人民公社一齐动手
    黑龙江积极外调农业用材
    本报讯　黑龙江省在以农业为基础的思想指导下，已经提前完成了农村需要的桥梁、车船、电杆、水利和小型农具等农村用材的生产计划。这些木材除满足了本省农村需要外，还分别外运到山东、河南宁夏、江苏、山西、辽宁、北京、天津等十二个省（区）市，支援农业生产。
    黑龙江省在生产农村用材中，采取了三管齐下的办法，森工企业、国营农场、木材产区的人民公社都担负了生产任务，大家一齐动手，根据需要，有什么就生产什么。森工企业主要生产农村特种用材，同时结合采伐生产小规格材料，国营农场和木材产区人民公社，主要是结合改造和培育森林，进行抚育采伐和修枝，以生产小型农具用材为主。已经生产的小型农具用材共有七百五十五万多件，计：犁辕子三万多根，木叉子六十万把，扁担一百五十万根，锄、锹、镐等各种农具把五百四十二万多件。
    为了加强这项工作的领导，中共黑龙江省委和省人委，先后召开了两次专门会议，作了研究部署。有关的专区、县根据省委指示精神，组织了林业、农业、商业等有关部门，成立了农用木材生产办公室，具体指导这项生产，解决生产中的各项具体问题。各地还开展了关于生产农村用材、支援农业的重大意义的宣传教育活动，使广大职工和社员，都积极投入了这个生产运动，并把它视为一项光荣的政治任务。
