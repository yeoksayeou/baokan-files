    Caring for the Lives of Everyone
    I am the group's welfare officer. My task is to care for everyone's lives, help everyone arrange their lives well, and wholeheartedly engage in production.
    The comrades in our group are very united and care about each other. If a comrade is on maternity leave at home, we often go to see her and help her solve some specific problems. Once, Ge Axiang gave birth to a child and was in the hospital. After I found out, I went to the hospital to see her and handled some life-related matters on her behalf. Every time we went to see her, she was very moved. After the vacation, when she returned to the factory, her enthusiasm for production was even greater than before.
    Usually, I also work with all the workers in the group to divide up areas and take responsibility for visiting sisters who are sick, have given birth, and comrades who are retired at home, to understand their living conditions and help them solve problems at any time. Everyone is producing and living well.

    关心大家伙的生活
    我是小组生活福利员，我的任务是关心大家的生活，帮助大家安排好生活，全心全意搞生产。
    我们组里同志们很团结，彼此都很关心。如有同志请产假在家，我们就常常去看她，帮助她解决一些具体问题。有一次，葛阿香生小孩住在医院里，我知道以后就到医院里去看她，并代她办些生活方面的事情。每次我们去看她，她都很激动。假期满后，回到厂里，她的生产劲头比过去更大了。
    平时，我还和全组工人一起，划分地区，包干访问生病、生小孩的姊妹，以及退休在家的同志，了解他们的生活情况，随时帮助他们解决问题。大家伙都生产、生活得很好。
