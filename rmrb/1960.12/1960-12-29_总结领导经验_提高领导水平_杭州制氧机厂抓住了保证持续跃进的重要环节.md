    Summarize Leadership Experience, Improve Leadership Level
    Hangzhou Oxygen Generator Factory Grasps the Important Link to Guarantee Continuous Leap Forward

    (Based on Zhejiang Daily) The Party Committee of Hangzhou Oxygen Generator Factory has adopted the method of summarizing experience in-depth in workshops to improve the leadership level of cadres, thereby mobilizing the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and further promoting production. Compared with October, the production level in November increased by 27%, the scrap rate of castings decreased by 0.82%, and the coke consumption per ton of iron melted was reduced by about 7 kilograms.
    With the continuous development of production, many new situations and new problems have emerged in production. For example, how should teams be managed, and how should management be improved to meet the needs of the new situation? In order to improve the level of leadership, so that leadership work is more in line with objective reality, and better mobilize the production enthusiasm of the masses, the factory Party committee started with summarizing leadership experience to improve the level of cadres. More than 40 cadres from various departments of the Party Committee, Administration, Trade Union, and Communist Youth League formed a working group. Cong Hanchen, the secretary of the factory Party committee, also participated in the working group and went deep into the workshops to carry out a mass experience summary activity.
    After the working group went deep into the workshops, they first mobilized the masses to speak out freely, put forward the problems in the current work, and then purposefully and selectively summarized the experience of solving these problems. After free airing of views, the main problems raised were in three aspects: First, regarding leadership style and leadership methods. Some cadres have gone deep into the teams, but what to grasp and how to help the teams complete the contracted production plan is still unclear in their minds. They only played the role of an ordinary worker in the teams. Some cadres go to a team, and the work of combining points and areas has not been done well. Either they grab the point and lose the area, or they lose the point and only have the area. Second, how to keep up with management work, especially planning management. It is a problem that some cadres have not solved, to communicate production plans deeply and thoroughly, and to formulate team plans that are both advanced and have room for maneuver. Third, how to improve the cadre's policy level, learn to grasp production with one hand and life with the other, and do a good job in combining work and rest, which everyone also wants to further solve.
    With the problems raised, the summary of experience has a clear direction. The working group selected the large parts workshop and the cast iron workshop as key points, relied on the masses, conducted investigations and research, and discovered the leadership experience that had been well resolved in these aspects. In terms of specific practices, the first step was to participate in labor in key teams to familiarize themselves with the situation, and conduct investigations while working, so that they were more informed. The second was to adopt the method of holding forums and individual networking to listen to the opinions of the masses; good experiences were adhered to and promoted; and improvement suggestions were put forward for practices that were not perfect enough. Third, on-site observation was used to increase perceptual knowledge. In specific activities, various different practices were compared, and not affirmed just by seeing a point. In addition, they also helped cadres summarize and improve their own work experience into written form. In this way, they basically knew what good experiences were in actual work, so they quickly summarized the leadership experience in these three aspects.
    On the issue of how to manage teams, the working group and workshop leaders compared the work of many party branches and took the disc party branch of the large parts workshop as a typical example, helping Lin Baomu, the secretary of this party branch, summarize the experience of grasping thought, production, management, innovation, and life with grasping thought as the key link. How can we effectively combine points and areas? Through extensive investigation, it was found that the method of Chen Hengmei, the secretary of the general branch of the large parts workshop, was better. When Chen Hengmei cultivated "experimental fields" in the ninth team, he seized the contradiction that the supply of tools could not keep up with the needs of production, which was common in the entire workshop, improved management, and changed the personal custody of tools to collective custody by the team. In this way, not only could the supply be met, but also brother teams could be supported; after this experience was promoted, the tool problem in the entire workshop was solved. The working group summarized his experience. Since October, the leaders of the cast iron workshop have followed the mass line when formulating plans, so the plans are both advanced and have room for maneuver, and the completion is very good. After the working group discovered this situation, they promptly summarized the experience of this workshop in formulating plans. The large parts workshop did a better job in combining work and rest. They concentrated their efforts on solving four problems: first, streamlining meetings; second, doing a good job in winter living and warmth for workers; third, taking care of the special needs of women workers in life; and fourth, improving the team mutual aid association. These practices also have universal guiding significance for the entire factory, and the working group also assisted the workshop in doing a good job of summarizing this as an important content.
    After summarizing the experience in these three aspects, the factory leadership firmly grasped the promotion. The main methods of promotion were to hold work experience exchange meetings; organize cadres to visit key workshops; and print the experience into documents and distribute them to cadres for study. The effect was very good after the promotion, and the cadres generally felt that it solved the problem. Cadres in cold processing, sheet metal welding, and other workshops said in discussions: Learning these experiences has three gains: first, it has improved understanding and knows that whether or not the team work can be grasped in depth mainly depends on whether the leadership is determined or not; second, they have learned working methods; third, they have improved their policy level and further realized the importance of grasping production with one hand and life with the other.
    Other experiences in planning and combining work and rest have also been fully promoted. Especially in the aspect of combining work and rest, the factory leaders made unified regulations based on the experience of each workshop. In this way, production and rest are well arranged, workers rest well, and production enthusiasm is even higher, so that the production of the entire factory has been further developed since October.

    总结领导经验　提高领导水平
    杭州制氧机厂抓住了保证持续跃进的重要环节
    本报讯　据浙江日报消息：杭州制氧机厂党委采取深入车间总结经验的方法，提高干部领导水平，从而调动了广大职工的生产积极性，进一步推动了生产。11月份与10月份比较，生产水平提高27％，铸件废品率降低0.82％，每化一吨铁的用焦量节省七公斤左右。
    随着生产的不断发展，生产上出现了不少新情况、新问题。如应该怎样抓小组，管理工作该如何改进才能适应新形势需要等等。为了提高领导水平，使领导工作更加符合客观实际，更好地调动群众的生产积极性，厂党委从总结领导经验入手，来提高干部水平。全厂由党委、行政、工会、共青团各部门四十余名干部组成了工作组，厂党委书记丛汉臣同志也参加工作组，深入车间，开展了一次群众性的总结经验活动。
    工作组深入车间后，首先发动群众大鸣大放，摆出当前工作中的问题，然后有目的、有重点地总结解决这些问题的经验。经过鸣放，提出来的主要问题有三方面：第一，关于领导作风和领导方法。有的干部是深入小组了，但是下去抓什么，怎样帮助小组完成包产计划？思想上还不明确，在小组中只起了一个普通劳动者的作用。有的干部下到一个组，点面结合工作没做好。不是抓了点丢了面，就是丢了点只有面没有点。第二是管理工作怎样跟上的问题。特别是计划管理。把生产计划交深交透，制定既先进又留有余地的小组计划，这是部分干部没有解决的问题。第三，如何提高干部政策水平，学会一手抓生产，一手抓生活，做好劳逸结合，这也是大家要求进一步解决的。
    提出了问题，总结经验就有了明确的方向。工作组就选择大件车间和铸铁车间为重点，依靠群众，调查研究，发掘这几方面解决得好的领导经验。在具体做法上，首先是在重点小组参加劳动，熟悉情况，边劳动，边调查，心中更加有数。其次是采取开座谈会和个别串连的办法，听取群众意见；好经验坚持推广；做法不够完善的提出改进意见。第三，是现场观察，增加感性知识。在具体活动中，把各种不同的做法加以比较，不是看到一点，就忙于肯定。此外还帮助干部把他自己的工作经验归纳提高，总结成文。这样，实际工作中有哪些好的经验，基本上心中有数，因此，很快就把这三方面的领导经验都总结起来了。
    在怎样抓小组的问题上，工作组和车间领导干部把很多党支部的工作加以比较后，以大件车间圆盘支部为典型，帮助这个党支部的支部书记林宝木同志总结了以抓思想为纲的抓思想、抓生产、抓管理、抓革新、抓生活的经验。怎样切实做到点面结合呢？通过广泛调查，发现大件车间总支书记陈亨楣同志的办法较好。陈亨楣同志在第九小组种“试验田”时，抓住全车间普遍存在的刀具供应跟不上生产需要的矛盾，改进管理，把刀具个人保管，改为小组集体保管，这样，不但供应得上，还能支援兄弟小组；这个经验推广后，全车间的刀具问题就解决了。工作组就把他的经验总结出来。铸铁车间领导从10月份以来，制定计划时走群众路线，因此，计划既先进又留有余地，完成情况很好。工作组发现了这个情况后，就把这个车间制定计划的经验及时总结出来。在劳逸结合方面，大件车间做得较好，他们集中力量解决了四个问题，一是精简会议，二是做好冬令职工生活保暖工作，三是照顾女工生活上的特殊需要，四是健全小组互助会。这些做法对全厂也有普遍指导意义，工作组也作为一项重要内容，协助车间做好总结。
    总结了这三方面的经验后，厂领导就狠抓推广。推广的主要方法是召开工作经验交流会；组织干部到重点车间参观访问；把经验印成文件发给干部学习等。推广以后，效果很好，干部都普遍感到很解决问题。冷加工、板焊等车间干部在讨论中说：学了这些经验，有三个收获：第一提高了认识，知道能不能深入抓好小组工作，主要还是看领导决心强不强；第二学到了工作方法；第三提高了政策水平，进一步体会到一手抓生产，一手抓生活的重要性。
    其他在编制计划、劳逸结合等方面的经验也全面推广了，特别在劳逸结合方面，厂领导根据各车间的经验，作了统一规定。这样生产、休息安排得好，工人休息好，生产劲头更高。使全厂生产自10月份以来，又有了进一步的发展。
