Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th -- The construction of the East Siberian Branch of the Siberian Branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, which is of great significance for the further development, utilization, and advancement of Siberia, is being accelerated. Irkutsk is becoming the scientific research center of East Siberia. Seven-year and fifteen-year long-term plans for the development of this scientific center have been formulated.

The scientific institutions that have already been established here include: the Institute of Organic Chemistry, the Institute of Geochemistry, the Institute of Geology, the Institute of Geography of Siberia and the Far East, the Siberian Exploration Research Committee, the Siberian Power Institute, the Siberian Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism, Ionosphere and Radio Wave Propagation, and the Baikal Lake Research Station. The entire scientific center has reached eight hundred scientific workers. Many of them are well-known Soviet scientists, and a large number of scientific workers from scientific institutions in Moscow, Leningrad, and other cities are still being transferred to East Siberia one after another. By the end of 1961, the East Siberian Branch will have 1,400 scientific personnel.

By the end of 1961, many new research institutes will also be established here, including the Institute of Physiology, the Baikal Lake Research Institute, the Fuel Integrated Processing Institute, the Institute of Automation and Machine Manufacturing, and the Institute of Electrochemistry. At the same time, a huge mathematical calculation center will be established here in the coming years.

A modern science city has already begun construction in Irkutsk, and large-scale construction work will begin in 1962-1963 after the Novosibirsk Science City is completed.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 29th -- Various industrial sectors in the Soviet Union are increasingly widely applying radioactive isotopes and nuclear radiation in production.

According to newspaper reports, the Soviet Union currently mass-produces more than 200 radiation sources consisting of 14 radioactive isotopes. In addition, a large number of radiation sources are in the experimental production stage. In the next three to four years, the scale of the use of radioactive isotopes and nuclear radiation in Soviet industry will increase tenfold, which can save the country 8 to 10 billion rubles annually.

At present, the Soviet Union has begun to use tracer atoms to test production processes in many industrial sectors such as metallurgy, petroleum, machinery manufacturing, exploration, mining, construction, textile, and food industries to further improve mechanical utilization, production automation level, and labor productivity.

The Kuznetsk Integrated Iron and Steel Plant has begun to use radioactive isotopes to study the movement of metal in open-hearth furnaces and steel casting buckets, so that the most appropriate duration for melting various steels can be accurately determined, thereby shortening the melting time by 20 to 30 minutes compared with the original, improving the production efficiency of each open-hearth furnace, and producing 75,000 tons of steel more each year.

The non-contact weighing instrument designed by the Central Scientific Research Institute of the Textile Industry, which uses beta rays to work, has been widely used in many industrial sectors such as cotton spinning, cardboard, and papermaking. This instrument can test product quality without stopping the machine and eliminate the reasons for the disruption of normal technological processes in a timely manner, thereby greatly improving product quality and production efficiency.

Radioactive isotopes are also used in the petroleum industry for exploration. In recent years, petroleum enterprises in Azerbaijan and Western Ukraine have used radioactive electrical measurement methods to survey approximately one million tons of oil in hundreds of abandoned oil wells.

In terms of machinery manufacturing, isotopes are also paving the way for studying the causes and nature of machine and tool wear. Scientific researchers have used isotopes to study materials related to the wear of cutting tools, and determined the parameters of the tools based on the materials obtained, thereby greatly improving production efficiency. The use of gamma rays to inspect the quality of castings has been promoted in steel joint ventures such as Kuznetsk and Magnitogorsk, the Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant, the Baltic Shipyard, and some aircraft factories. Gamma rays are much more effective than X-rays. In comparison, gamma ray instruments are easy to carry, simple to install, low in cost, simple to use, and can be fluoroscoped in any situation.

The Soviet Union is now trying to supply industrial sectors with more isotopes and equipment, while also running short-term training courses to train cadres so that isotopes can be universally used in industry.

    苏联加速建设东西伯利亚科学研究中心
    许多工业部门日益广泛使用放射性同位素和核辐射
    新华社莫斯科30日电　对进一步开发、利用和发展西伯利亚有重要意义的苏联科学院西伯利亚总分院东西伯利亚分院的建设工作正在加速进行。伊尔库次克正在变成东西伯利亚的科学研究中心。发展这个科学中心的七年和十五年远景规划已经制订出来。
    现在这里已经建立起来的科学机构有：有机化学研究所，地质化学研究所，地质研究所，西伯利亚和远东地理研究所，西伯利亚勘察研究委员会，西伯利亚动力研究所，西伯利亚地磁、电离层和无线电波传播研究所以及贝加尔湖湖泊研究站。整个科学中心的科学工作者已达八百人。其中有许多是苏联著名的科学家，莫斯科和列宁格勒等城市科学机关的大批科学工作者还在陆续调往东西伯利亚。到1961年底，东西伯利亚分院将拥有一千四百名科学人员。
    到1961年底这里还将设立许多新的研究所，其中包括生理研究所、贝加尔湖湖泊研究所、燃料综合加工研究所、自动化和机器制造研究所、电化学研究所。同时，近年内还将在这里建立一个巨大的数学计算中心。
    一个现代化的科学城已经在伊尔库次克开始兴建，大规模的建设工作将在1962—1963年间新西伯利亚科学城建成后开始。
    新华社莫斯科29日电　苏联各工业部门日益广泛地在生产中应用放射性同位素和核辐射。
    据报纸报道，苏联目前大批生产的已有由十四种放射性同位素组成的二百多种辐射源。此外，尚有大量辐射源处于试验性生产阶段。在今后三、四年内，苏联工业中采用放射性同位素和核辐射的规模将成十倍地增加，这样每年可为国家节省八十至一百亿卢布。
    目前苏联在冶金、石油、机器制造、勘探、采矿、建筑、纺织、食品等许多工业部门中都已开始利用示踪原子来检验生产过程，进一步提高机械利用率、生产自动化水平和劳动生产率。
    库兹涅茨克联合钢铁厂已经开始利用放射性同位素研究平炉和铸钢桶内金属运动的情况，这样就可以精确确定熔炼各种钢的最适当的延续时间，从而使熔炼时间比原先缩短二十至三十分钟，使各个平炉生产效率提高，每年可多生产七万五千吨钢。
    纺织工业中央科学研究所设计的、利用贝塔射线进行工作的不接触测重仪，在棉纺、纸板、造纸等许多工业部门得到广泛应用。这种仪器可以在不停机情况下检验产品质量并及时消除正常工艺过程遭到破坏的原因，因而大大提高了产品质量和生产效率。
    在石油工业中也应用放射性同位素来进行勘测。阿塞拜疆和西乌克兰的石油企业近年来利用放射性电测的方法在几百个废油井又勘察出约一百万吨石油。
    在机器制造方面，同位素也正在为研究机器和工具磨损的原因和性质开辟道路。科学研究人员已利用同位素研究出有关切削工具磨损情况的材料，并根据所得材料确定刀具的参数，从而大大提高生产效率。用伽玛射线来检验铸件质量，已在库兹涅茨克、马格尼托哥尔斯克等钢铁联合企业，乌拉尔重型机器制造厂，波罗的海造船厂和一些飞机工厂中推广。用伽玛射线比用爱克斯射线效果好得多。两者比较，伽玛射线仪器携带方便，装置简单，成本低，使用方法简单，并可以在任何情况下进行透视。
    现在苏联正在设法供应工业部门更多的同位素和仪器设备，同时开办短期训练班培养干部，以便在工业中普遍利用同位素。
