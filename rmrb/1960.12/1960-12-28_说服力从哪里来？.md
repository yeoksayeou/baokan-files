Where Does Persuasiveness Come From?
Hong Shan

    Li Qiubai, the Party General Branch Secretary of the Nanqiao Brigade in Doushan Commune, Taishan County, Guangdong Province, implements agricultural technical measures by always going through experimentation and always involving the masses. This ensures that both leaders and the masses have a clear understanding, jointly promoting production.

    Leading agricultural production without understanding the laws of agricultural production makes it impossible to achieve increased production. The peasant masses, through long-term production practice, generally have already grasped the laws of local agricultural production. Using the working method of "everything through experimentation" and concentrating the good experiences of the masses can help us see through the complicated phenomena and understand the essence of things. If the leaders do not understand the situation, even if the masses understand a lot, it will not have the proper effect. The responsibility of the leaders lies in going deep, concentrating the good experiences of the masses, conducting serious experiments, and then promoting them. Li Qiubai took a correct path. When promoting improved varieties of crops from other places and direct seeding of rice, he initially did not know the characteristics of these improved varieties, nor did he understand whether direct seeding of rice was feasible. However, after summarizing the direct seeding experience of the masses and personally planting "experimental fields," he came to understand the laws of objective things and proposed increased production measures that were in line with local realities. If this were not done, and if one only blindly believed in advanced measures from other places, without first understanding how the masses were doing, without conducting experiments, and without studying local conditions, and insisted on promoting them among the masses, then one might blindly direct production and seriously affect the enthusiasm of the masses. Because the natural conditions of each commune, production team, and production group are not entirely the same, whether advanced technical measures are suitable for the local area can only be known after careful and down-to-earth investigation and research, soliciting the opinions of the masses, and conducting experiments. Therefore, whether promoting advanced technical measures adheres to understanding the practical experience of the masses and whether the method of "everything through experimentation" is adopted is actually a question of whether to follow the mass line. Because what the cadres do not yet understand, the masses may not necessarily not understand. Often the broad masses run ahead of the cadres, urgently needing to move forward, while the cadres are still lagging behind. When Li Qiubai was planning to do direct seeding of "Dwarf Glutinous Rice," he discovered that the masses had already directly seeded a field, which is one example.

    Then, can it be said that cadres who already understand and have considerable experience in leading production, like Li Qiubai, can do without involving the masses and no longer adhere to the working method of "everything through experimentation"? Still not. Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "Our comrades should not think that what they understand is also understood by the broad masses. Whether the masses already understand and whether they are willing to take action can only be known by going among the masses to investigate." ("On Coalition Government") To achieve increased agricultural production, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to strive for it. To mobilize the masses to do it, first of all, it is necessary to make the masses understand, which requires experimentation. The masses not only understand what is going on, but also grasp the methods, and then they can be determined to do it. It is natural for the masses to be unwilling to do it if they feel they are not sure. The responsibility of the leaders is to establish a "safety-first mentality" through experimentation. This safety-first mentality is not just lip service, but is proven by the facts of increased production. In this way, the enthusiasm of the masses can be mobilized to the greatest extent. Why did Li Qiubai have such great persuasiveness when he planted sweet potatoes on the mountain? It was because he not only made the masses understand that sweet potatoes could be planted on the mountain, but also gave the masses confidence and determination to plant them.

    Li Qiubai's experience shows that no matter how rich the experience of the cadres, everything must go through experimentation, everything must involve the masses, and one must advance together with the masses.

    说服力从哪里来？
    洪山
    广东省台山县斗山公社南乔大队党总支书记李球柏，在推行农业技术措施的时候，一切经过试验，一切通过群众，使领导和群众都能做到胸中有数，共同推动生产。
    领导农业生产，不知道农业生产的规律性，就不可能达到增产的目的。农民群众经过长期的生产实践，一般说已经掌握了当地农业生产的规律性，运用“一切经过试验”的工作方法，集中群众的好经验，就能够帮助我们透过纷杂的现象，洞察事物的本质。如果领导不了解情况，即使群众了解得很多，也不能起到应有的作用。领导的责任就在于深入下去，把群众的好经验集中起来，经过认真的试验，再加以推广。李球柏走了一条正确的道路，在推广外地良种和水稻直播的时候，开始也不知道这种良种的特性，不了解水稻直播是否可行。可是，经过总结群众的直播经验，亲自种“试验田”，就认识了客观事物的规律性，提出了切合当地实际的增产措施。如果不这样做，只是迷信外地的先进措施，不先去了解一下群众做得怎样，也不搞试验，不研究当地的条件，硬要在群众中推广，那就可能盲目地指挥生产，严重地影响群众的积极性。因为各个公社、生产队、生产小队的自然条件总不完全相同，先进的技术措施是否适用于当地，那是要经过认真踏实的调查研究，征求群众的意见，并且经过试验以后才能知道的。所以，推行先进的技术措施，是否坚持了解群众的实践经验，是否采用“一切经过试验”的方法，实际上就是一个是否走群众路线的问题。因为干部还不了解的东西，群众不一定不了解。往往广大群众跑到干部的前头去了，迫切需要前进一步，干部还落在后边。当李球柏正打算做“矮仔粘”直播时，他发现群众已经直播了一块田，就是一例。
    那末，干部已经懂得的，而且有了相当丰富的领导生产的经验，像李球柏那样，是不是可以不必通过群众，不再坚持“一切经过试验”的工作方法了呢？还不能。毛泽东同志曾经说：“我们的同志不要以为自己了解了的东西，广大群众也和自己一样都了解了。群众是否已经了解并且是否愿意行动起来，要到群众中去考察才会知道。”（《论联合政府》）要使农业增产，就要发动群众去争取。既要发动群众去做，首先要使群众懂得，就要通过试验。群众不仅懂得了是怎么一回事，而且掌握了方法，而后才能下决心去做。群众认为没有把握，不愿去做，这是很自然的。领导的责任，就是要通过试验，树立“保险思想”。这种保险思想不是口说的，而是被增产的事实所证明了的。这样，就能最大限度地调动起群众的积极性。李球柏上山种番薯，为什么对群众有那样大的说服力，就是因为他不仅使群众懂得了山上可以种番薯，而且使群众有信心，有决心要种。
    李球柏的经验可以说明，不管干部的经验多么丰富，都要一切经过试验，一切通过群众，同群众一道前进。
