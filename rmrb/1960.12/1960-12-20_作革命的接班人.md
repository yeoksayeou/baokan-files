    Being a Successor to the Revolution
    Wang Qingying is the son of Wang Xian, the former Second Secretary of the Tongxian District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei Province and Commissioner of the Tongxian Special District. He has settled down in the countryside for three years and has now become a new type of farmer who loves labor.
    When Wang Qingying graduated from primary school, one evening, his father solemnly announced to him: "Go to the countryside to be a farmer." At first, Wang Qingying couldn't understand. Wang Xian patiently said to him: "To go to the countryside and be China's first generation of cultured new-type farmers is a glorious cause. The children of our revolutionary cadres should take the lead in responding to the Party's call." After hearing these reasons, Wang Qingying resolutely accepted his father's suggestion, expressing his determination to inherit the revolutionary tradition and be a successor to the revolution.
    For the past three years, Wang Qingying has diligently learned from the farmers. He is now proficient in most of the major field work. During the Great Leap Forward, he also worked with the commune members to improve the rice transplanter and sweet potato ridger, and became a junior technician for the Red Scarves Hydroelectric Power Station. He also learned electrical engineering technology and installed broadcasting lines for more than ten villages in the Liangxiang Rice Field Brigade.

    作革命的接班人
    王庆英是原中共河北省通县地委第二书记、通县专署专员王宪的儿子，他在农村安家落户已经三年了，现在已变成一个热爱劳动的新型农民。
    王庆英高小毕业那年，有一天晚上，父亲对他严肃地宣布：“到农村中去当农民”。起初，王庆英还想不通。王宪就耐心地对他说：“到农村去做中国第一代有文化的新型农民，这是光荣的事业，我们革命干部的子弟，应当带头响应党的号召”。听了这些道理以后，王庆英就毅然接受了父亲的意见，表示要继承革命的传统，作革命的接班人。
    三年来，王庆英认真地向农民学习，一般的大田活他已一般都拿得起来。在大跃进中，还和社员一道改革了水稻点种机、白薯打埂器，当了建立红领巾水电站的小技师。他还学会了电工技术，为良乡稻田大队十多个村安装了广播线。
