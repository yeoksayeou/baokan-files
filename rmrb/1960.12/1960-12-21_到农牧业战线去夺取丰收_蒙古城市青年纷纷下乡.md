    Go to the Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Front to Seize a Bumper Harvest
    Mongolian City Youths Go to the Countryside in Large Numbers

    Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, December 19th: Ochirbat, Secretary of the Mongolian Revolutionary Youth League, said today when meeting with a reporter from this agency that in order to promote the development of agriculture and animal husbandry, the Mongolian Revolutionary Youth League has mobilized more than 5,000 urban youths to go to state-owned farms and animal husbandry machine stations to engage in production since the end of last year.

    He said that after these youths went to the agricultural and animal husbandry front, they effectively promoted the production of agriculture and animal husbandry. Most of the people working in the newly established Tsetserleg State Farm, Darkhan Farm, and Kherlen State Farm are newly arrived youths. Thanks to the efforts of the youth and all the farm workers, they achieved a good harvest of more than 1,000 kilograms per hectare in the first year on the newly reclaimed wasteland. Among them, Tsetserleg State Farm and Darkhan Farm were also rewarded by the Mongolian Council of Ministers.

    Ochirbat also said that the youths also actively participated in the construction of water conservancy projects in the countryside. Youths in Zavkhan, Bayan-Ölgii, and Govi-Altai provinces have built a canal more than 1,000 kilometers long, which can irrigate 35,000 hectares of land. The youths also built a large number of clubs, medical stations, nurseries, shops and other buildings in the countryside.

    He said that after the youths went to the agricultural and animal husbandry production front, they were at ease with their work, and they actively studied agricultural and animal husbandry techniques. The youths who went to Tsetserleg State Farm have learned more than two techniques. Dayaan, who was originally a circus performer in Ulaanbaatar, quickly learned the techniques of driving tractors and combine harvesters and other machines after going to Tsetserleg State Farm.

    到农牧业战线去夺取丰收
    蒙古城市青年纷纷下乡
    新华社乌兰巴托19日电　蒙古革命青年团书记奥其尔巴拓今天在接见本社记者时说，为了促使农牧业的发展，蒙古革命青年团从去年年底到现在已经动员了五千多名城市青年，到国营农牧场和畜牧业机器站去从事生产。
    他说，这些青年到农牧业战线上去以后，有效地促进了农牧业的生产。在新建立起来的茨勒特尔国营农牧场、达尔罕农牧场、科尔伦国营农牧场里工作的大部分是新下去的青年。由于青年和农场全体职工的努力，在新开垦的荒地上，第一年就获得了每公顷收一千多公斤的良好收成。其中茨勒特尔国营农牧场和达尔罕农牧场还得到了蒙古部长会议的奖励。
    奥其尔巴拓还说，青年们在农村还积极参加兴修水利工程。匝盆、巴彦乌列盖、戈壁阿尔泰等省的青年们修建了一条一千多公里长的水渠，能够灌溉三万五千公顷的土地。青年们还在农村盖建了大批的俱乐部、医疗所、托儿所、商店等建筑物。
    他说，青年们到农牧业生产战线后，都安心工作，他们积极学习农牧业技术。到茨勒特尔国营农牧场去的青年都学会了两种以上的技术。原来是乌兰巴托马戏团演员的达扬，到茨勒特尔国营农牧业场后，很快地学会了驾驶拖拉机和联合收割机等机器的技术。
