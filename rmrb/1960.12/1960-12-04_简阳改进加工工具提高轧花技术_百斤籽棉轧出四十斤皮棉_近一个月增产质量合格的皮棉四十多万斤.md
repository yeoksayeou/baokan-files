Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu: Jianyang County in Sichuan Province, through technological innovation and improved ginning techniques in its 106 cotton ginning mills, has increased the average lint turnout rate (percentage of lint cotton obtained from every 100 jin of seed cotton) from 33.4% to 40.2%. In less than a month, this resulted in an increase of over 400,000 jin of lint cotton for the state. After inspection, the quality of this cotton is good and fully meets the requirements for spinning.

Jianyang County is one of the key cotton-producing areas in Sichuan Province. Before the new cotton was put on the market, the county organized all cotton processing factories to vigorously reform tools and improve processing efficiency. All of the more than 1,200 ginning machines that have been modified in the county have eliminated the heavy labor of manual foot-operated ginning, and have been converted to be driven by water power, animal power, or electricity. In this way, the labor force used for cotton processing in the county has been reduced from 8,000 people last year to more than 3,000 people, and the processing time can also be shortened by one-third compared with previous years.

While reforming cotton processing machinery, the ginning mills also paid attention to continuously improving the technical level of workers, and extensively organized ginning workers to familiarize themselves with the performance of ginning machines and learn simple maintenance and installation techniques. Now, more than 90% of the ginning workers in the county can complete the improvement and installation of an ordinary ginning machine in just over an hour. Many workers can also use different operating methods during ginning according to the different quality of cotton, to ensure fast ginning and more cotton production.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, reporter Fan Sui reports: Xie Guocai, the Party branch secretary of the Shuimotan Processing Plant in Shinian Commune, Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, along with the workers, vigorously carried out technological innovation and改造了19台used for nearly a century of leather roller ginning machine, creating an average record of 44 pounds of lint cotton per 100 pounds of seed cotton. As soon as the news spread, people from all directions came to "learn from experience" one after another.

In September of this year, when the new cotton was put on the market, Xie Guocai and everyone discussed how to improve the lint turnout rate (the percentage of lint cotton from every 100 jin of seed cotton).

Xie Guocai disassembled the parts of the ginning machine, looked at them repeatedly and carefully, and then put them back one by one, put on the drive belt, and watched how it ginned the cotton. He saw that the distance between the upper and lower rollers was uneven, and the cotton was not ginned cleanly, so it slipped out through the cracks. Based on this discovery, he adjusted the distance between the rollers, so that the lint cotton output increased from 35 jin to 37 jin.

The lint turnout rate of the ginning machine in Shuimotan reached 39.4% after several improvements, and could no longer be raised. However, Xie Guocai did not believe that the potential of these old machines had been exhausted. With the joint efforts of Xie Guocai and the workers, they reformed the ginning machine. They repeatedly studied the structural principles of the ginning machine and looked for ways to improve cotton output.

In less than a month, after more than 100 improvements, they finally created a cotton output record of 44 jin.

    简阳改进加工工具提高轧花技术
    百斤籽棉轧出四十斤皮棉
    近一个月增产质量合格的皮棉四十多万斤
    据新华社成都电　四川简阳县一百零六个轧花厂，通过技术革新和提高轧花技术，棉花加工平均衣分率（每百斤籽棉出皮棉的百分率）从33.4％上升到40.2％，不到一个月时间就为国家增产了四十多万斤皮棉。经过检验，这些棉花质量良好，完全符合纺纱要求。
    简阳县是四川省棉花重点产区之一。新棉上市以前，这个县就组织各棉花加工厂大力改革工具，提高加工效率。全县已经改装的一千二百多部轧花机，全部消灭了人力踩花的笨重劳动，改用水力、畜力或电力带动。这样，全县用于棉花加工的劳力由去年的八千人减为三千多人，加工时间也可以比往年缩短三分之一。
    在改革棉花加工机具的同时，各轧花厂还注意不断提高工人的技术水平，广泛组织轧花工人熟悉轧花机的性能，学会简单的维修、安装技术。现在，全县90％以上的轧花工人，改进和安装一台普通的轧花机，一般只需一个多小时就能完成。许多工人还能根据棉花质量不同，在轧花的时候运用不同的操作方法，保证快轧棉、多出花。
    据新华社成都电　记者范眭报道：四川省简阳县石埝公社水磨滩加工厂党支部书记谢国才，跟工人们一起大闹技术革新，改造了十九台用了将近一个世纪的皮辊轧花机，创造了平均每百斤籽棉出四十四斤皮棉的纪录。消息传出，四面八方“取经”的人络绎不绝。
    今年9月，新棉上市，谢国才和大伙儿核计着，怎样才能提高衣分率（每百斤籽棉出皮棉的百分率）。
    谢国才把轧花机的零件拆下来，反复细看，然后又一件件装上去，套上轴带，看它怎样轧花。他看到轧刀上下之间距离不齐，棉花不等轧净，就从缝缝里溜出去了。根据这个发现，他调整了轧刀的距离，使所出皮棉从三十五斤上升到三十七斤。
    水磨滩的轧花机，经过几次改进，衣分率达到39.4％以后，再也升不上去了。但是谢国才不相信这些老机器的潜力已经挖尽，经过谢国才和工人们的共同努力，一起改革轧花机。他们反复研究轧花机的构造原理，寻找提高出棉的窍门。
    在不到一个月的时间里，经过一百多次改进，最后终于创造出了四十四斤的出棉纪录。
