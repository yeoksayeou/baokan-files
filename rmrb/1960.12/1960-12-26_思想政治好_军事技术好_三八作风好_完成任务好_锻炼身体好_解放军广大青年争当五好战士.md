Xinhua News Agency, December 24th: The "Five-Good" movement launched by the Chinese People's Liberation Army among the broad masses of young soldiers has recently seen a vigorous new upsurge throughout the army.

The People's Liberation Army began carrying out the "Five-Good" movement among young people in the troops in 1958. In the past two years or so, hundreds of thousands of "Five-Good" soldiers and "Five-Good" cadres, and tens of thousands of "Five-Good" units have emerged throughout the army, playing a great role in enlivening the troops, strengthening youth work, and promoting the great leap forward in various tasks of the troops. Now, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are all young people, and a large proportion of the cadres are also young people. The main targets of political work and mass work in the troops are youth work. This year, the Military Commission of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Marshal Lin Biao issued a call to the troops: "The whole army should do youth work and continue to carry out the 'Five-Good' movement." Based on the development of the "Five-Good" movement over the past two years, some changes have been made to the content of the "Five-Good" movement. The current "Five-Good" contents are stipulated as: good in ideology and politics, good in military skills, good in the "Three-Eight" work style, good in completing tasks, and good in physical training. The youth of the whole army enthusiastically responded to the call of the Central Military Commission and Marshal Lin Biao, and everyone is determined to strive to be a glorious "Five-Good" soldier. The broad masses of young officers and soldiers enthusiastically discussed the content of the "Five-Good" criteria, talked freely about the conditions for becoming a "Five-Good" soldier, and everyone made plans and expressed their determination. Young commanders and fighters of a certain unit in Beijing expressed their determination at a mobilization meeting to march toward the "Five-Good" goals, to achieve the "Five-Good" conditions, and to vow to be "Five-Good" pacesetters.

In the "Five-Good" movement, the broad masses of young people in the troops have raised the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher. Young soldiers have restudied Chairman Mao's instruction that "without a correct political viewpoint, it is as if one has no soul," striving to study Chairman Mao's works, striving to cultivate the habit of caring about the major affairs of the Party, the major affairs of the country, and the major affairs of the people, and striving to achieve "good in ideology and politics." Each "Five-Good" evaluation begins with an evaluation of ideological goodness, followed by an evaluation of achievement levels. Among a group of "Five-Good" soldiers recently selected by a certain unit in Beijing was Wang Shoufu, the artillery squad leader who had diligently studied Chairman Mao's works and had enabled the entire squad to achieve excellent single-gun shooting scores for four consecutive years. In past training sessions, his squad's ideological mutual assistance group ensured that the entire squad's ideology was red and that everyone's performance was good. In order to be strong fighters on the ideological and political front, the broad masses of young people in the troops are all learning to do ideological and political work, and many have become "little instructors" in their companies. They consciously abide by the Party's policies and frequently propagate the Party's lines and policies to the masses.

The "Five-Good" movement has further promoted young soldiers' proficiency and mastery of their weapons, their grasp of modern military science and technology, and their efforts to achieve "good in military skills." The young people of the army, navy, and air force, as well as various special forces, with the ambitious goal of "no peak is insurmountable," are diligently studying and practicing to operate airplanes, warships, and tanks well, and to improve gun and artillery shooting skills. Hong Rongcheng, a "Five-Good" soldier and a new recruit who enlisted this year from a coastal defense unit in Zhejiang, has diligently studied and practiced, and has already achieved excellent shooting scores twenty-eight times in a row.

In the "Five-Good" movement, young people in the troops are even more fond of the fine work style of the old Red Army and the old Eighth Route Army, and even more fond of the glorious traditions of the people's army. They are striving to achieve "good in the 'Three-Eight' work style."

Since the launch of the "Five-Good" movement, sports training, labor-defense system exercises, and various extracurricular sports activities in various units have become more active. (Attached picture)

    解放军广大青年争当五好战士
    据新华社24日讯　中国人民解放军在广大青年战士中开展的“五好”运动，最近在全军出现了一个轰轰烈烈的新高潮。
    解放军在部队青年中开展五好运动，是从1958年开始的。两年多来，全军涌现出五好战士和五好干部数十万人，五好单位几万个，对活跃部队、加强青年工作、推动部队各项工作的跃进都起了很大作用。现在，人民解放军的战士都是青年，干部也有很大一部分是青年，部队政治工作和群众工作的主要对象是青年工作。今年，中共中央军事委员会和林彪元帅向部队提出了“全军都来做青年工作，继续开展五好运动”的号召，并根据两年来五好运动的发展情况，将五好运动的内容作了一些改变，规定现在的五好内容是：思想政治好，军事技术好，三八作风好，完成任务好，锻炼身体好。全军青年热烈响应了中央军委和林彪元帅的号召，人人立志争当光荣的五好战士。广大青年官兵热烈讨论五好内容，畅谈五好条件，人人订出计划，个个表达决心。北京某部队青年指战员们，在向五好进军的誓师大会上表示决心，实现五好条件，誓当五好标兵。
    在五好运动中，部队广大青年更高地举起毛泽东的思想红旗。青年战士们重温毛主席的“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂”的指示，努力学习毛主席的著作，努力养成关心党的大事、国家的大事和人民的大事的习惯，争取做到“思想政治好”。每次评比五好，都是先评思想好不好，再评成绩高不高。北京某部队最近评选出的一批五好战士中，有认真学习毛主席的著作，连续四年使全班单炮射击打优秀的炮兵班长王守福。他那个班的思想互助组，在历次训练中，保证了全班思想红，人人成绩好。部队中广大青年为了做思想政治战线上的坚强战士，人人学做思想政治工作，许多人成了连队里的“小指导员”。他们自觉地遵守党的政策，并且经常向群众宣传党的路线、政策。
    五好运动进一步推动了青年战士们熟练和精通手中武器，掌握现代军事科学技术，努力做到“军事技术好”。陆海空三军以及各特种兵的青年们，以“无高不可攀”的雄心壮志，勤学苦练，要把飞机、军舰、坦克开好，要提高枪、炮射击技术。浙江海防部队五好战士、今年入伍的新兵洪荣成，苦学苦练，射击已连获二十八次优等成绩。
    在五好运动中，部队青年更加热爱老红军、老八路的优良作风，更加热爱人民军队的光荣传统，他们力争做到“三八作风好”。
    开展五好运动以来，各部队的体育训练、劳卫制锻炼和各种课外体育活动更加活跃。（附图片）
