Xinhua News Agency, December 14th, Washington - U.S. State Department spokesman White made successive statements on the Laotian situation on the 12th and 13th, instigating the Nosavan-Wenong rebel group, under the patronage of the United States, to expand the flames of the civil war in Laos with the puppet "government" pieced together in Savannakhet, and fabricating excuses for further U.S. intervention in the Laotian situation.

In his remarks, White openly referred to the crime of the Nosavan-Wenong traitorous group hijacking the King of Laos and illegally organizing a "government" as an action taken in accordance with so-called "constitutional procedures," and announced that the United States no longer recognizes the Phouma government. A senior U.S. official in Washington also blatantly claimed that the rebel group's puppet "government" is the so-called "legitimate government of Laos."

White emphasized that the U.S. government will continue to provide "assistance" to the Nosavan-Wenong group, and stated that the United States hopes that the establishment of the Laotian puppet "government" "will lead to a satisfactory solution to the Laotian problem."

White also fabricated rumors, falsely accusing the Soviet Union of providing weapons to the Phouma government, attempting to create excuses for further U.S. intervention in the Laotian situation.

According to the Associated Press, U.S. Secretary of State Herter, on the eve of traveling to Paris to attend the upcoming NATO Ministerial Council meeting, had already held "high-level talks" with British and French officials in Washington to discuss further steps to intervene in Laos. The American news agency said that the United States is now "determined to force its allies to take a united stand on the explosive situation in Laos." White stated at a press conference on the 13th that developments in the Laotian situation "will obviously be raised for discussion" during the NATO meeting.

To discuss the Laotian situation during the NATO meeting, Parsons, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, who recently traveled to Laos to conduct conspiracies, will accompany Herter to Paris.

    美国国务院发言人发表谈话
    公然支持老挝叛军扩大内战
    新华社14日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院发言人怀特12日和13日接连就老挝局势发表谈话，怂恿在美国卵翼下由诺萨万—文翁叛乱集团在沙湾拿吉拼凑起来的傀儡“政府”扩大老挝内战的战火，并为美国进一步干涉老挝局势预制借口。
    怀特在谈话中公然把诺萨万—文翁叛国集团挟持老挝国王非法组织“政府”的罪行，称为是所谓“按照宪法程序”采取的行动，并且宣布美国不再承认富马政府。华盛顿的一个美国高级官员也公然声称叛乱集团的傀儡“政府”是所谓“老挝的合法政府”。
    怀特强调美国政府将继续向诺萨万—文翁集团提供“援助”，并且说什么美国希望老挝傀儡“政府”的成立“将导致老挝问题的令人满意的解决”。
    怀特还大肆造谣，诬蔑苏联正在向富马政府提供武器，企图为美国进一步干涉老挝局势制造借口。
    据美联社报道，美国国务卿赫脱在前往巴黎参加即将举行的北大西洋公约集团部长理事会会议的前夕，已经在华盛顿同英、法两国官员举行“高级会谈”，商讨进一步干涉老挝的步骤。这家美国通讯社说，美国现在“正坚决要迫使它的盟国对老挝具有爆炸性的局势采取一致态度”。怀特在13日的记者招待会上表示，在北大西洋集团会议期间，老挝局势的发展“显然将被提出讨论”。
    为了在北大西洋集团会议期间讨论老挝局势，不久前曾经到老挝进行过阴谋活动的美国负责远东事务助理国务卿帕森斯，将随同赫脱前往巴黎。
