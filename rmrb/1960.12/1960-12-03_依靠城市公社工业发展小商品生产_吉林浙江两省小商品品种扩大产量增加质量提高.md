Xinhua News Agency, Changchun Dispatch: Jilin Province is actively organizing urban people's commune industries to produce small commodities. As of the end of October, the province's self-sufficiency in small commodities has increased by 8% compared to the beginning of the year; varieties have reached more than 5,900, an increase of 16% compared to the beginning of the year.

In order to ensure the steady development of small commodity production, Party committees at all levels in Jilin Province have universally strengthened their leadership over urban people's commune industries producing small commodities and have made appropriate divisions of labor based on the nature and technical conditions of the enterprises. Areas such as Changchun, Jilin, Siping, Baicheng, and Tonghua have established small commodity production base networks, mainly relying on urban people's commune industries. Baicheng City already has ninety-four specialized factories and twenty-two specialized workshops producing small commodities. Since being designated as a base for producing small commodities, the industry of Chuanying People's Commune in Jilin City has seen a monthly increase in the variety of small commodities produced. In June, it produced fifty-one kinds of small commodities; in July, it increased to eighty-two kinds; in August, it increased to one hundred and seventy-six kinds; and in September, it surged to three hundred and twenty-four kinds.

In developing small commodity production, in addition to the state allocating a portion of raw materials, various localities have also linked up with state-owned factories, making full use of scrap materials from large factories, establishing small commodity raw material bases, vigorously promoting comprehensive utilization, saving materials, and opening up sources of raw materials through various methods.

Jilin Province also implements classified management of the production, supply, and sales of small commodities, incorporating small commodity production into plans at each level and arranging production on a quarterly and monthly basis to ensure market supply.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou Dispatch: Small commodity production in Zhejiang Province has increased substantially, with the variety of designs increasing from more than 2,000 to more than 3,000, including 100 products that were originally supplied from other places. Dozens of brand-name products with a long history produced in the province, such as Zhang Xiaoquan scissors and Wenzhou umbrellas, have seen monthly increases in output and improvements in quality, with many new designs and varieties added. These products are continuously shipped and sold throughout the country and are deeply welcomed by consumers.

Zhejiang Province produces many of the small commodities it needs domestically, but in previous years, a portion of products still relied on supplies from other places. Since the beginning of this year, with the growing needs of the people's lives, the requirements for the quantity, quality, and variety of small commodities have become increasingly high. Relevant leading departments in Zhejiang Province have conducted investigations into market needs and rationally arranged small commodity production. Party committees at all levels have also strengthened their leadership over this work. Ningbo, Hangzhou, Wenzhou, and other places have established specialized teams for small commodity production in urban people's communes, implementing the "five fixings" method of fixed location, fixed personnel, fixed equipment, fixed products, and fixed supply and sales relationships, so that small commodity production has been rapidly developed. The output of many famous brand products produced in various places has increased by about 50% compared to the same period last year.

The broad masses of workers are doing everything possible to use the least amount of raw materials to produce more products in the production of small commodities. Huzhou Comprehensive Hardware Factory has made full use of scrap materials from large factories to produce small commodities. The output in the first ten months of this year has more than doubled compared to the same period last year, the variety of products has increased from more than ten to more than fifty, and costs have significantly decreased.

    依靠城市公社工业发展小商品生产
    吉林浙江两省小商品品种扩大产量增加质量提高
    据新华社长春电　吉林省积极组织城市人民公社工业生产小商品，截至10月末止，全省小商品自给量已比年初增加8％；品种达到五千九百多种，比年初增加16％。
    为保证小商品生产稳步发展，吉林省各级党委普遍加强了对生产小商品的城市人民公社工业的领导，并根据企业性质、技术条件作了适当分工。长春、吉林、四平、白城、通化等地区，以城市人民公社工业为主，建立了小商品生产基地网。白城市已经有九十四个生产小商品的专业工厂，二十二个专业车间。吉林市船营人民公社工业自从划为生产小商品的基地以后，小商品的品种逐月增加。6月份生产五十一种小商品，7月增加到八十二种，8月增加到一百七十六种，9月猛增到三百二十四种。
    各地在发展小商品生产中，除由国家调拨一部分原料材料外，还同国营工厂挂钩，充分利用大厂边角废料，建立小商品原料基地，大搞综合利用，节约用材，用多种办法开辟原料材料来源。
    吉林省还对小商品的产、供、销实行分级管理，把小商品生产逐级纳入计划，逐季、逐月安排生产，保证市场供应。
    据新华社杭州电　浙江省小商品生产大幅度增长，花色品种由原来的二千多种增加到三千多种，其中有一百种产品原来是依靠外地供应的。本省出产的张小泉剪刀、温州雨伞等几十种有悠久历史的名牌产品，产量月月上升，质量也有提高，花色品种增加很多。这些产品源源运销全国各地，深受消费者欢迎。
    浙江省需要的小商品，省内生产的很多，但历年来仍有一部分产品要靠外地供应。今年以来，随着人民生活需要的日益增长，对小商品的数量、质量、花色品种的要求越来越高。浙江省有关领导部门对市场需要作了调查，合理地安排了小商品生产。各级党委也都加强了对这项工作的领导。宁波、杭州、温州等地建立了城市人民公社小商品生产专业队伍，实行定点、定人、定设备、定产品、定供销关系的“五定”办法，使小商品生产得到迅速发展。各地生产的许多名牌产品就比去年同期增长50％左右。
    广大工人在生产小商品中千方百计地用最少的原料，生产更多的产品。湖州综合五金厂充分利用大厂边角废料生产小商品，今年前十个月的产量比去年同期增加一倍以上，品种由十多种增加到五十多种，成本显著下降。
