On the Ordinary Post

    In recent days, Zhang Decai, a worker at the Changchun Bus Factory, has been repeatedly considering a problem: how to use the leftover material from cutting ventilators for buses in production. Once, he took a piece of waste material with an outer diameter of 280 mm and an inner diameter of 30 mm and asked a technician: There are more than 1,000 kinds of parts on a bus, can this material be used? When the technician said it couldn't be used, Zhang Decai was not discouraged. He borrowed the process files of more than 1,000 parts from the technical office and read through them from beginning to end. Later, he measured the dimensions of the parts one by one. When he flipped through more than 200 pieces of material, he found a part of the diffuser that was almost the same as this piece of waste material. He was extremely happy. From then on, the waste material from manufacturing ventilator parts was used to manufacture diffuser parts; diffuser parts were also removed from the material requisition list. However, using waste material to manufacture diffuser parts still left a piece of material the size of a copper coin. He thought: even though this piece of material is small, it shouldn't be wasted in vain. So he looked for a use for it again. After more than a week, he went through more than 1,000 parts and finally used the waste material on the lamp cover, without leaving any leftover. Through Zhang Decai's efforts, the raw materials for manufacturing ventilators have achieved the ingenious punching of one material into three uses, and the steel utilization rate has reached 100%.

    一料巧冲三种料
    这几天，长春客车厂工人张德才在反复考虑一个问题：怎样把制造客车通风器剪裁下来的边余材料用到生产上去。有一次，他拿着一块外径二百八十公厘、内径三十公厘的废料，去问技术员：客车上有一千多种零件，这块料能不能用上？当技术员说用不上的时候，张德才没有灰心，他从技术室借来一千多种部件的工艺档案，从头翻阅起来，后来他又一个个地量着零件的尺寸，当他翻了二百多份材料的时候，发现扩散筒有一个零件，正和这块废料差不多，他高兴极了。从此，制造通风器零件的废料，就被用来制造扩散筒的零件了；扩散筒零件也从此在领料单上销掉了。但是，用废料制造扩散筒零件，还剩下铜钱大的一块料，他想：这块料虽然小，也不能白白浪费掉。于是他又给它找对象。经过一个多星期，他翻了一千多种零件，终于一点不剩地又把这块废料用到灯盖上了。经过张德才的努力，使制造通风器的原材料实现了一料巧冲三种料，钢材利用率达到100％。
