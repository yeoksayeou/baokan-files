    Great Changes in Mountains and Rivers
    Song Hua Ju
    Three years are but a blink of an eye,
    Myriad changes upon the mountain head.
    Rice flowers fragrant in the clouds,
    Green waters and verdant hills inlaid with gold.
    What was once forest land,
    Is now entirely a land of rice and grain.
    Red light flashes before the furnace,
    Molten iron like a river's source.
    Ancient trees stand tall and upright,
    Pillars for the construction of the motherland are everywhere on the mountain.
    Even though traveling the road is harder than ascending the blue sky,
    Filling valleys and building bridges to open new paths,
    Steel cables and wooden rails tightly connected,
    Transportation without shoulders.
    Factory motors are running,
    Sesame oil and fine wine on light boats float,
    Paper and boards are too numerous to count,
    Products are complete.
    Not long ago, a blank sheet of paper,
    New scenery is added.
    In another three years, the new district,
    Greater plans will be unfurled.

    山川巨变
    宋华桔三年只是转瞬间，山头上变化万千。稻花飘香云间，绿水青山镶金边。从前林中地，如今尽变米粮川。炉前红光闪，铁水似河源。古木挺拔参天，建设祖国的栋梁遍山。纵是行路难于上青天，填谷架桥开新道，钢索木轨紧相连，运输不用肩。工厂马达运转，香油美酒轻舟泛，纸张板材数难点，产品俱全。曾几何时，一张白纸，景色新添。再三年，新山区，宏图更大展。
