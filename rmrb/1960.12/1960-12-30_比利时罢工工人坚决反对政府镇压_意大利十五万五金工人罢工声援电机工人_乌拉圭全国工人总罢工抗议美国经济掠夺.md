Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, 28th: Seven thousand striking workers in the Belgian capital held a large demonstration for the second consecutive day today. Workers marched arm in arm through the streets, chanting slogans against the reactionary government of Eyskens, and marching spiritedly while singing "The Internationale" and "La Marseillaise."

As the national strike struggle in Belgium entered its ninth day, the Belgian authorities revealed their ferocious nature and more frantically suppressed the workers. In many places, the military police barbarically attacked unarmed demonstrators.

In Brussels, armed mounted police and troops armed with machine guns used violence to disperse demonstrating workers. In Ghent, gendarmes used tear gas to attack workers. In Liège and Tongeren, incidents of gendarmes violently beating workers also occurred.

The workers responded to the authorities' suppression with resolute actions. A strike leader in Brussels publicly announced: "The people of Brussels will never succumb to Eyskens' fascist methods."

After receiving news about the gendarmes' violence against workers, many trade unions in the northern Belgian city of Antwerp immediately called for a general strike to protest the authorities' fascist suppression. Many factory and company employees immediately responded. By 2:00 PM local time, the Hoboken shipyard was completely paralyzed, and activities at major port facilities had also ceased.

In the northern regions of Belgium, the stronghold of Eyskens' Catholic Social Party, a wave of workers' struggle is also unfolding. Many workers who are members of the Catholic Social Party's trade unions are also joining the struggle, disregarding the obstruction of the right-wing leadership of the trade unions. Workers at two power plants in Antwerp, as well as workers at several textile factories in the cities of Aalst and Elewijt, have gone on strike. The power plant in the coastal city of Ostend has stopped supplying electricity, and passenger ships traveling between Ostend and Dover, England, have also stopped running.

Xinhua News Agency, December 29th: Rome Dispatch: 155,000 metalworkers in Milan, the famous Italian industrial and commercial city, went on strike for half a day on the 28th in solidarity with the 60,000 electrical workers in the area who are on strike.

The electrical workers' strike has lasted for more than a month. On Christmas Day, they held a demonstration in the city, resolutely demanding higher wages and improved working conditions.

On the same day, 53,500 railway workers held a 24-hour national strike, paralyzing the national railway transportation system. This is the second major railway workers' strike to occur this month.

Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo, December 28th: Uruguayan workers held a 24-hour general strike today to protest the so-called "economic stabilization plan" imposed on Uruguay by the United States through the International Monetary Fund, to reaffirm the defense of democratic trade union rights, and to express support for the legitimate demands of tobacco workers and workers in other industries who have been on strike for nearly two months.

The general strike paralyzed Uruguay, with passenger transport suspended throughout the country, cinemas closed, and newspapers ceasing publication. Participating in the general strike were workers from various industries, including electricity, metallurgy, textiles, chemicals, sugar production, wool, and transportation. 90% of the trade unions across the country participated in this unified action called for by the Uruguayan Workers' United Trade Union.

    据新华社布鲁塞尔28日电　比利时首都七千名罢工工人今天接连第二天举行大示威。工人们臂挽着臂在大街上游行，高呼反对伊斯更斯反动政府的口号，并且高唱“国际歌”和“马赛曲”昂扬行进。
    在比利时全国性罢工斗争进入第九天的今天，比利时当局凶相毕露，更加疯狂地镇压工人。军警在许多地方竟野蛮袭击手无寸铁的示威群众。
    在布鲁塞尔，武装骑警和手持机关枪的军队用暴力冲散示威的工人。在根特，宪兵用催泪弹袭击工人。在列日和通格列斯，也都发生了宪警行凶殴打工人的事件。
    工人们用坚决的行动来回答当局的镇压。布鲁塞尔的一个罢工工人领袖当众宣布：“布鲁塞尔的人民绝不在伊斯更斯的法西斯手段面前屈服。”
    在接到关于宪警对工人行凶的消息后，比利时北部的安特卫普市许多工会立即号召举行总罢工，抗议当局的法西斯镇压。许多工厂和公司的职工立即起来响应。到当地时间下午两点的时候，荷波根的造船厂已经全部瘫痪，港口各大设施的活动也都停止。
    在伊斯更斯的天主教社会党的老巢——比利时北部各地，工人们的斗争浪潮也正在展开。参加天主教社会党工会的不少工人群众也不顾工会右翼领导机构的阻挠，投入了斗争。安特卫普两家发电厂的工人，阿罗斯特和艾伦波德荷姆两市好几家纺织厂的工人，都举行了罢工。滨海城市奥斯顿德的发电厂已经停止供电，奥斯顿德同英国多佛之间来往的客船也停止开行。
    据新华社29日讯　罗马消息：著名的意大利工商业城市米兰的十五万五金工人28日罢工半天，声援当地六万电机工人的罢工。
    电机工人的罢工已经持续了一个多月。在圣诞节这一天，他们在这个城市举行了示威游行，坚决要求提高工资，改善劳动条件。
    同一天，五万三千五百名铁路工人举行了二十四小时全国性罢工，使全国铁路运输陷于瘫痪。这是本月内发生的第二次铁路工人大罢工。
  据新华社蒙得维的亚28日电　乌拉圭全国工人今天举行二十四小时总罢工，抗议美国通过国际货币基金组织强使乌拉圭执行的所谓“稳定经济计划”，重申保卫工会民主权利，并表示支持已经坚持罢工近两月之久的烟草工人和其他行业工人提出的正当要求。
    总罢工使乌拉圭全国陷于瘫痪，各地客运停顿，电影院关门，报纸也停止出版。参加这次总罢工的包括电力、冶金、纺织、化学、制糖、羊毛、运输等各个行业的工人，全国90％的工会都参加了这一由乌拉圭工人统一工会所号召的统一行动。
