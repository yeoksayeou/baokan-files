Eliminating One Insect This Year Is Equivalent to Eliminating Ten Thousand Insects Next Year
    Chengnan Commune Ingeniously Handles Rice Stubble Based on Overwintering Habits of Rice Borers

    (Our report) Changning Commune in Yizhang County, Hunan Province, in the winter planting and winter plowing campaign, based on the occurrence and development patterns of rice borers and the various times of plowing of paddy fields, ingeniously handled rice stubble, ensuring that it could kill a large number of overwintering rice borers and save labor.

    The contrasting facts of two production teams in the Chengdong Brigade of this commune fully illustrate the importance of skillfully controlling rice borers. The Jiangpotou Production Team mastered the pupation and eclosion (emergence) patterns of rice borers and the different plowing times of various paddy fields, adopting different methods to comprehensively handle rice stubble. The effect was very good, and the rice borers were thoroughly eliminated. On average, only 0.3 workdays were spent per mu of paddy field to handle rice stubble. The 排楼水 (Pailou Shui) Production Team did not differentiate between the different plowing times of various paddy fields, and manually pulled rice stubble from every field. Although the overwintering rice borers were eliminated as thoroughly as in the Jiangpotou Production Team, nearly one workday was spent per mu of paddy field to handle rice stubble.

    Through summarization, the broad masses of cadres and people have improved their strategic and tactical understanding of eliminating overwintering rice borers. Each brigade, production team, and work group has formulated a winter rice borer control plan, ingeniously and comprehensively handling rice stubble. For example, the Jiaoxi Brigade, based on the overwintering rice borers pupating in early and mid-March and eclosing in late March, and the different times of plowing various paddy fields, handled the rice stubble fields of the entire brigade differently depending on the situation: For winter-planted wheat fields, rapeseed fields, and grass seed fields that cannot be plowed before mid-March next year, rice stubble should be thoroughly cleaned up in conjunction with winter planting, and the rice stubble should be used for compost or burned into ashes to kill the rice borers hidden in the rice stubble. Vegetable fields that can be plowed before mid-March next year can wait until plowing and flooding to kill all the overwintering rice borers before eclosion. For paddy fields that cannot be winter-planted but can be winter-plowed, rice stubble should be trampled into the water to kill the rice borers. For dry winter fields that cannot be winter-planted and cannot be plowed and flooded before mid-March next year, all the rice stubble should be pulled or dug up and used for compost. This rice borer control plan has been implemented down to each field along with the winter crop plan, with signs planted in each field. The implementation of this plan will not only ensure the comprehensive and thorough elimination of overwintering rice borers in the entire brigade but also save more than 1,400 workdays for handling rice stubble compared to last year.

    In the process of handling rice stubble, leaders and cadres at all levels went deep into the fields to participate in labor, check quality, and carry out skill competitions. Comrade Wang Shouxiang, Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, participated in handling rice stubble in the Luojiaguan Brigade and found that some rice stubble was not handled according to quality standards. Some of the pits for composting rice stubble did not have the upper layer submerged in water; some of the compost piles did not have high or even temperatures, and the mortality rate of rice borers was not high; especially pulling and trampling rice stubble by hand was inefficient and exhausting. He immediately consulted with cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians to jointly formulate a set of technical measures to ensure quality: Rice stubble should be pulled out along with its base; the water in the rice stubble compost pit should cover the rice stubble; when composting rice stubble, more heat-generating fertilizer should be added as starter fertilizer, and a layer of mud should be pasted around the compost pile to ensure that both the inner and outer layers of the pile reach a high temperature of 65 degrees Celsius; when burning rice stubble into ash, it should be dried and added with dry firewood and dry grass, and burned at high temperature for a long time to kill all the overwintering rice borers hiding in the rice stubble.

    Currently, more than 5,000 mu of the nearly 7,000 mu of wheat, rapeseed, grass seed, broad bean, and green manure seed retention fields that need to be handled in the entire commune have been handled. A campaign to advance winter plowing and pull rice stubble has been launched in winter fallow fields. Of the 5,000 mu of winter-irrigated fields in the entire commune, more than 1,000 mu have been plowed and harrowed once, and the rice stubble has been completely beaten into the mud with a roller, and lime has also been applied per mu. Of the winter fallow fields that lack water and cannot be winter-plowed, more than 800 mu have had rice stubble pulled or dug up. In conjunction with handling rice stubble, the entire commune has also prepared 30,000 dan of compost in pits, 40,000 dan of compost piles, and more than 10,000 dan of burned soil ash.

    Linzhang Commune in Cixian County, Hebei Province, known for its abundant wheat production, has planted a total of 86,000 mu of winter wheat this year. Because it was planted early and planted well, the wheat is generally growing well. This is a member of the Beiguan Production Team of Linzhang Commune using "ortho-basic ammonium sulfonate" to prevent and control wheat rust.

### 今年消灭一条虫等于来年消灭万条虫  城南公社根据螟虫越冬规律巧妙处理禾蔸

    今年消灭一条虫等于来年消灭万条虫
    城南公社根据螟虫越冬规律巧妙处理禾蔸
    本报讯　湖南宜章县城南公社在冬种冬耕运动中，根据螟虫发生发展规律和各种稻田翻耕的时间，巧妙地处理禾蔸，保证了既能大量消灭越冬螟虫，又节省了劳力。
    这个公社的城东大队有两个生产队的对比事实充分说明了巧治螟虫的重要意义。江坡头生产队掌握了螟虫蛹化、羽化规律和各种稻田的不同翻耕时间，采取不同的办法全面处理禾蔸，效果很好，螟虫消灭得彻底，平均每亩稻田处理禾蔸只花人工零点三个。而排楼水生产队不分各种稻田的不同翻耕时间，丘丘用人工拔禾蔸，越冬螟虫虽然和江坡头生产队一样消灭彻底，但每亩稻田处理禾蔸用工近一个。
    通过总结，广大干部群众都提高了消灭越冬螟虫的战略战术。每个大队、生产队、作业组都制订了冬季治螟规划，巧妙地全面处理禾蔸。如焦溪大队根据越冬螟虫都在3月上中旬蛹化，下旬羽化的规律，和各种稻田翻耕的时间，将全大队禾蔸田分别不同情况处理：到明年3月中旬不能翻犁的冬种小麦田、油菜田、草子田等，结合冬种，检净禾蔸，将禾蔸沤肥，烧火土灰，杀死藏在禾蔸中的螟虫。到明年3月中旬能够翻犁的蔬菜田，可等到翻犁浸水时将越冬螟虫全部杀死在羽化以前。不能冬种但能进行冬耕的水田，则将禾蔸踩在水里，杀死螟虫。对不能冬种，并且在明年3月中旬前不能翻犁浸水的干冬田，则将禾蔸全部拔掉或挖掉，沤肥。这一治螟规划随着冬播作物规划落实到了丘，丘丘插上牌子。按这个规划实现，不但保证了全大队全面彻底消灭越冬螟虫，而且比去年节省了一千四百多个处理禾蔸的人工。
    在处理禾蔸中，各级领导和干部深入田间边参加劳动，边检查质量，又开展了巧干竞赛。公社党委书记王守祥同志在罗家灌大队参加处理禾蔸，发现部分禾蔸处理不合质量规格，有的沤禾蔸的氹子上层没浸水；有的堆肥温度不高不匀，螟虫死亡率不高；特别是用手拔脚踩禾蔸，工效低，人又辛苦。他马上找干部、老农、技术员研究，共同制订了一套保证质量的技术措施：拔禾蔸要连基部拔出；禾蔸沤氹，氹里的水要盖住禾蔸；禾蔸沤堆肥，要多放热性肥料作娘子粪，堆肥四周糊上一层泥巴，使堆的内层外层都要达到摄氏六十五度的高温；禾蔸烧灰时要晒干并加干柴干草，高温久烧，使躲在禾蔸里越冬的螟虫全部杀死。
    现在，全公社应处理禾蔸的近七千亩小麦、油菜、草子、蚕豆和绿肥留种田，已处理五千多亩。对冬闲田开展了提早冬耕和拔禾蔸运动。全社有水的五千亩冬浸田，已有一千多亩普遍犁耙了一次，并用蒲滚将禾蔸全部打入泥里，每亩还下了石灰。缺水不能冬耕的冬闲田，已经有八百多亩将禾蔸拔掉或挖掉。结合处理禾蔸，全社还沤氹肥三万担，沤堆肥四万担，烧火土灰一万多担。（附图片）
    以盛产小麦著称的河北省磁县临漳公社，今年共种冬小麦八万六千亩，由于种得早，种得好，小麦普遍生长良好。这是临漳公社北关生产队的社员在用“对位基本磺铵酸”防治小麦锈病。
