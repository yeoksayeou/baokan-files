Intelligence from Zeng Guofan's Staff

Zeng Guofan's pro-foreign stance in handling the Tianjin Massacre, as he himself said, was "only a method of seeking compromise" (June 28, 1870, reply to the memorial on the Tianjin case), a plan decided upon even before he went to Tianjin. This can be clearly seen from a piece of intelligence from Zeng Guofan's staff, written by his aide Shi Nianzu to British Minister Sir Rutherford Alcock, inquiring about the situation of the Tianjin Massacre.

The intelligence reveals that on June 26, when Zeng Guofan received the imperial decree to investigate the Tianjin case, he also received "continuous letters" from the Zongli Yamen (Office in Charge of Affairs Concerning All Nations), "advising him not to say there was concrete evidence, lest it lead to a major change," urging Zeng Guofan to eliminate all evidence of imperialist crimes in Tianjin during the investigation.

Before Zeng Guofan went to Tianjin, "those who dissuaded him, advised him, submitted memorials, and offered suggestions arose in droves," warning him to be vigilant, lest "a slight misstep lead to eternal doom." He "could not listen to any of them," and even refused to bring these advisors to Tianjin to handle the case, "personally stopping them from going." The staff "initially did not understand what he meant. But upon seeing a memorial before his departure, with the words 'Since the French have suffered many casualties this time, it is impossible to admit wrongdoing,' they realized that the reason why these suggestions were not adopted was that the topic was already tilted from the start." That is to say, Zeng Guofan already had a fixed opinion, and naturally would not listen to his staff's advice to consider the people's sentiments.

After Zeng Guofan arrived in Tianjin, he saw that "the public sentiment in Tianjin was still agitated, with drawings of the beating and killing of foreigners being engraved, printed, and made into doufang and fan faces to celebrate their victory" (Zeng Guofan's letter to Minister Bao Peiheng), and that "although I have repeatedly informed them, it is still difficult to immediately alleviate their hostility towards foreigners" (Zeng Guofan's memorial of June 28), and he indeed reiterated in his memorial that the people of Tianjin's accusations of all the imperialists' crimes had "no concrete evidence." Furthermore, according to the demands of the imperialists, he "dismissed the local officials and handed them over to the Ministry of Justice," as a "radical remedy." These various pro-imperialist measures that catered to the imperialists made the people even more angry, and "the curses deepened."

The intelligence revealed that the "barbarian sentiment" at the time was "treacherous and uncertain, advancing or retreating solely based on our strength or weakness." When the incident occurred, the imperialists were initially afraid, "When the Tianjin affair first started, all countries were shaken, and the capital was in turmoil, their courage was initially intimidated." Then, seeing that the local officials were indeed removed as they had demanded, they took the opportunity to attack, "threatening in every way and demanding everything." Later, seeing the frequent troop movements, they became "extremely panicked again." In conclusion, "Observing their advancement when they see an opportunity and retreat when they see danger, this group has no fixed intention, and the power to manipulate them is actually in our hands." Zeng Guofan, in such a favorable situation, still wanted to cruelly suppress the people, and his traitorous heart, persisting in being an enemy of the people, is evident.

The informant, Shi Nianzu, also had a set of poems (including "Writing My Grievances," "Feelings on the Road to Tianjin," "Tianjin Ballad," and "Sixteen Rhymes of Tianjin"), angrily denouncing the Qing court's pro-foreign stance ("The Southern Dynasty was used to seeking the Jurchens’ pleasure") and Zeng Guofan being a Qin Hui who deserved to be executed ("I beg to hang Qin Hui's head for life and death"), and mourning the suffering of the Tianjin heroes ("Pitifully, the lives of the people are beyond discussion"). He described the tragic scene at the time as "Dusk rain weeps like heaven, the sea cannot bear to flow."

The intelligence, originally called "Secret Reply," is found in the "Manuscripts of Yuyu Studio" (1892), Volume 3, written in 1870. The published edition includes a postscript by the informant in 1884, stating that "The great injustice of the Tianjin Prison is ultimately buried. The real situation at the time is easily forgotten over time. Because of the influence of power and position, which has always been intimidating, some fear harming the times, others fear inciting disaster. After hundreds of years, those who mislead the country and escape blame, and harm the people to eliminate their crimes, will not be allowed to escape. While those who flatter and curry favor will wield their pens and books, twisting and embellishing their words, praising and flattering them, allowing those who deceive the world to deceive for thousands of years." In order to allow "future sages" to understand "the right and wrong of initiating conflicts, the truth and falsehood of public opinion, the loyalty and treachery of those in charge, and the truth and falsehood of barbarian sentiment," it is necessary to make the real situation public to the world. By this time, Zeng Guofan had been dead for thirteen years.

    来自曾国藩幕内的情报
    曾国藩在查办天津教案时的媚外，正如他自己所说的“惟有委曲求全之一法”（1870年6月28日复陈津案各情片），是在他去天津之前就已决定了的方案。这从来自曾国藩幕内，他的幕友史念祖写给英西林宫保询问天津教案情况的一份情报里，可以看清。
    情报揭露了6月26日曾国藩得旨查办津案的同时，就接到总署（总理各国事务衙门）“连函”，“劝勿说有实据，恐成大变”，要曾国藩在查勘的时候，消灭可以作为帝国主义者在天津犯罪的一切证据。
    曾国藩赴津前，“阻者、劝者、上言者、条陈者纷起沓进”，要他警惕，以免“略一失足，千古无底”。他“均不能听”，甚至不愿把这些进言者带到天津办案，“均面止勿往”。幕府们“初不喻何意。及睹临行一疏，有‘此次法国既伤多命，断难再认理屈’二语，始悟诸议不蒙下录者，看题早左矣”。就是说，曾国藩早有定见，幕府们劝他也要顾到民心的话，自然听不进了。
    曾国藩到天津后，看到“天津民情嚣张如故，将打杀洋人画图刻板刷印斗方扇面，以鸣得意”（曾国藩《宝佩蘅尚书》），“虽经臣叠次晓谕，而其疾视洋人，尚难遽予解化”（6月28日曾国藩折），等等情况，果然复疏天津人民所控诉的帝国主义一切罪恶，
  “并无实证”。又按照帝国主义的要求，“将守令革职交刑部”，“为釜底抽薪之妙策”。种种迎合帝国主义的媚外措施，使人民更加愤怒，“诅毒滋深”。
    情报揭露了当时“夷情”，是“诡谲不定，专视我之强弱为进退”。事变发生，帝国主义者最初是害怕，“津事初起，各国震动，三辅汹汹，早慑其魄”。接着是看到守令果然照他们的要求撤任，就趁机进攻，“万端恫喝，百计诛求”。后来看到军队调动频繁，又“不胜仓皇”。归结起来，“观其乘机即进，见势即退，彼族初无定志，操纵之权，实操自我”。曾国藩在这样有利形势下，仍然要残酷地镇压人民，其坚持与人民为敌的卖国贼心肝也就可见了。
    情报者史念祖也有一组诗（包括《书愤》、《天津道中有感》、《津门曲》、《津门十六韵》诸题），愤怒地痛诋清廷媚外（“南朝惯博金人喜”），曾国藩是秦桧当斩（“死生乞斩桧头悬”），并哀悼天津义士的受难（“可怜民命不堪论”）。他形容当时的惨象，简直是“黄昏吹雨天如泣，海水于今不忍流”。
    情报原称“密复”，载《俞俞斋文稿》（1892）第三卷中，作于1870年。刊本后面加有情报者1884年的自跋，说明“天津之狱，大冤终埋。当时实情，年久易泯。因势位所在，从古慑人，或虑伤时，或惧媒祸，十百年后，不将令误国逃讥，殃民弭罪，而谄炎攀贵之辈，拈毫挟册，转得以支离粉饰之词，谀颂其间，坐使欺天下者更欺千古”。为使“后之贤者”明了“启衅之曲直，舆论之是非，当事之忠奸，夷情之真伪”，有必要将实情公之天下，这时曾国藩死去已经十三年了。
