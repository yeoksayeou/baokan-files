Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 18th - This reporter reports: This year, Poland's industrial front is playing a triumphant song of production and construction. The entire industry, especially the heavy industry sector, is developing rapidly.

According to the latest statistics, this year will be the year with the fastest growth in Poland's industrial production in the past five years. It is estimated that the entire industry will complete 103% of the annual plan, and the total output value will increase by 10% compared with 1959; according to this year's national economic development plan, the total industrial output value will increase by 8.6%.

This year, the production of heavy industry departments has been particularly rapid. According to the plan, this year's heavy industrial production should increase by 14.5% compared with last year. However, the heavy industry sector completed the annual plan on December 15, and will produce 3%-4% more than the plan by the end of the year; the total value of over-planned production will reach 4 billion zlotys (Polish currency).

In 1960, Poland's important industrial sectors presented a prosperous picture of production. The production situation of the coal mining industry is unprecedentedly good. It is estimated that the annual coal output will break through the 100 million ton mark and reach more than 104 million tons. This will set the highest record for annual coal output in the history of Polish coal mining, an increase of nearly 5 million tons compared with 1959. An increase of 5 million tons of coal production within one year is also the first time in the history of Polish coal mining. At the same time, the labor productivity of the coal mining industry has also been significantly improved. This year, although the number of coal miners has decreased by 12,000 compared with 1957, the average daily coal output has increased from 296,000 tons in 1957 to 337,000 tons this year.

Poland's total output value of the chemical industry will increase by 19% compared with last year. This is the year with the highest development speed of the chemical industry in the past eight years (the average annual growth rate in the past was about 10%-11%). Major chemical products will have a significant increase compared with last year. For example, sulfuric acid production will reach 500,000 tons, an increase of 11.5% compared with last year; soda ash production will reach 500,000 tons, an increase of 14% compared with last year; chlorine will increase by 20%, and plastics will increase by 50%. The production of synthetic rubber will increase from 5,800 tons last year to 20,000 tons this year. The production of other products such as pesticides and fertilizers has also increased significantly.

In the metallurgical industry, due to the commissioning of the No. 9 open hearth furnace of the country's largest metallurgical joint enterprise, "Nowa Huta," and new equipment in other steel plants, Poland's steel production this year will exceed the plan by 100,000 tons, reaching 6.5 million tons. The output of steel products will also have a large increase compared with last year.

Poland's machine manufacturing industry has made great progress this year, with a growth rate of 17%. This year, Poland will produce more than 20,000 machine tools, including dozens of new machine tools. Shipyards across the country produced a total of 66 large ships this year. The production of machinery and complete sets of equipment has increased rapidly compared with last year. With the development of the machine manufacturing industry, Poland has exported its own equipment and machinery to more than 60 countries this year, and the exported machinery and equipment have accounted for 28% of the country's total exports.

1960 was a year of large-scale construction and accelerated basic construction in Poland. There are about more than 1,000 large and medium-sized construction projects newly built and expanded throughout the country this year. This year, Poland paid special attention to expanding productive investment, with 40% of the country's total investment used for the development of industry. As a result of the concentrated use of investment, Poland completed and put into production 720 large and medium-sized industrial projects this year, compared with 540 last year. The famous Auschwitz Chemical Joint Enterprise has built some more factories this year, bringing the number of factories included in this enterprise to 50. Thanks to the hard work of the construction workers, the second phase of the Tarnobrzeg Sulfur Joint Factory and the Skawina Aluminum Plant has been put into production five months ahead of schedule. The completion of a large number of new industrial projects has guaranteed the rapid development of industry this year. The great achievements made by Polish industry in 1960 are inseparable from the improvement of the production enthusiasm of the working masses, the development of labor competitions, and the unfolding of the technical innovation movement. This year, the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers in Poland is very high, and the labor competition movement has been vigorously launched everywhere. At present, there are more than 6,000 production units across the country that are conducting labor competitions, and more than 80% of coal mining and metallurgical enterprises have participated in the competition movement. There are more than 7,000 production teams participating in the competition for the title of "Socialist Labor Team," totaling about 100,000 people. In terms of technical innovation, factories and mines have launched technical innovation movements this year. After a large number of workers and technicians were involved in this movement, they actively put forward rationalization proposals. In the first half of this year alone, factory and mine workers put forward 42,800 rationalization proposals, and the technical innovation movement has seen new developments in the second half of the year.

Since the beginning of spring this year, according to the resolution of the Third Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party, all parts of the country have vigorously rectified factory management, improved labor organization, strengthened labor discipline, and on this basis, revised the labor quotas that have been implemented since 1953. After rectification, factories and mines have generally increased labor quotas by 10%-15%. At present, 400 enterprises in the machine manufacturing industry alone have implemented new labor quotas. These measures have played a promoting role in production development and labor productivity improvement.

    波兰今年工业生产加速发展
    整个工业将超额完成年度计划  总产值将增长百分之十
    新华社华沙18日电　本社记者报道：今年波兰工业战线上高奏生产建设的凯歌。整个工业、尤其是重工业部门正以很快的速度向前发展。
    根据最新的统计材料，今年将是最近五年来波兰工业生产增长最快的一年。预计，整个工业将完成年度计划的103％，总产值将比1959年增长10％；而按照今年国民经济发展计划，工业总产值是增长8.6％。
    今年，重工业部门的生产特别迅速。按照计划，今年重工业生产应比去年增加14.5％，但是，重工业部门在12月15日就完成了年度计划，到年底将再超计划生产3％—4％；超计划生产的产品总值将达四十亿兹罗提（波币名）。
    在1960年，波兰的重要工业部门呈现出一幅生产繁荣的景象。采煤工业的生产情况空前良好。预计，全年采煤量将突破一亿吨大关，而达到一亿零四百多万吨。这将创波兰采煤历史上的年采煤量的最高纪录，比1959年增加近五百万吨。一年之内采煤量增加五百万吨，这在波兰采煤工业历史上也还是第一次。同时，采煤工业的劳动生产率也有了显著的提高。今年，煤矿工人虽然比1957年减少了一万二千人，但是每昼夜的平均采煤量却从1957年的二十九万六千吨增为今年的三十三万七千吨。
    波兰今年化学工业的总产值将比去年增长19％。这是化学工业最近八年来发展速度最高的一年（过去平均每年增长速度是10％—11％左右）。主要化学产品都将比去年有显著的增长，例如，硫酸产量将达五十万吨，比去年增长11.5％；苏打产量将达五十万吨，比去年增长14％；氯增长20％，塑料增长50％。合成橡胶的产量将从去年的五千八百吨增加到今年的二万吨。其它如农药、肥料等的生产也都有很大增长。
    在冶金工业方面，由于全国最大的冶金联合企业——“诺瓦胡塔”第九号平炉及其它钢铁厂的新设备投入生产，今年波兰的钢产量将超过计划十万吨，达到六百五十万吨。钢材的产量也将比去年有很大的增长。
    波兰机器制造业今年得到了长足的发展，增长速度将达到17％。今年波兰生产的机床将达两万多台，其中包括几十种新式机床。各地的造船厂在今年一年内总共生产了六十六条大轮船。机器和成套设备的生产都比去年迅速增加。随着机器制造业的发展，波兰今年向六十多个国家出口了自己生产的设备和机器，出口的机器设备已占全国出口总值的28％。
    1960年是波兰大兴土木、加快基本建设速度的一年。全国今年新建和扩建的大中型工程项目约一千多个。今年波兰特别注意扩大生产性的投资，全国投资总额的40％用于发展工业。由于集中使用投资的结果，波兰今年建成并投入生产的大、中型工业项目达七百二十个，去年是五百四十个。著名的奥斯威辛化学联合企业在今年又建成了一些工厂，从而使这个企业所包括的工厂达到了五十个。由于建筑工人的辛勤劳动，塔尔诺布热格硫磺联合厂和斯卡维纳制铝厂的第二期工程已提前五个月投入了生产。大批新的工业项目完工，为今年工业的迅速发展提供了保证。1960年波兰工业所取得的巨大成就，是同工人群众生产积极性的提高、劳动竞赛的发展以及技术革新运动的展开分不开的。今年，波兰广大工人群众劳动热情十分高涨，劳动竞赛运动到处蓬勃展开。现在，全国共有六千多个生产单位正在进行劳动竞赛，80％以上的采煤和冶金企业都参加了竞赛运动。单是参加争取“社会主义劳动队”称号竞赛运动的就有七千多个生产队，共约十几万人。在技术革新方面，今年各厂矿都开展了技术革新运动。大批工人和技术人员在卷入这个运动后，都积极提出了合理化建议。仅在今年上半年，各厂矿工人就提出了四万二千八百条合理化建议，下半年技术革新运动又有了新的发展。
    今年入春以来，全国各地根据波兰统一工人党三中全会的决议，大力整顿工厂管理、改善劳动组织、加强劳动纪律，并在这一基础上修改了从1953年起实行的劳动定额。经过整顿以后，各厂矿一般都把劳动定额提高了10％—15％。现在，仅机器制造工业就有四百个企业实行了新的劳动定额。这些措施对生产发展和劳动生产率提高起了促进作用。
