Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: Los Angeles dispatch: The American newspaper *Los Angeles News-Mirror* published a dispatch from Guatemala City by editor Con DeWiggins, confirming that a large secret airport in Retalhuleu, Guatemala, built with American funding and intended for use in an attack on Cuba, has been completed in eighty days. DeWiggins also reported that the airport, which can accommodate jet aircraft, is heavily guarded and inaccessible to the public. However, Guatemalan business figures, aviation officials, and journalists are aware of the airport's construction.

Earlier, Guatemalan public opinion had revealed that at least fifty American pilots and some American mechanics were stationed at the Retalhuleu airport. American planes stationed at this airport are constantly transporting weapons, equipment, and mercenaries from the United States to Guatemala in preparation for an invasion of Cuba.

    准备装运武器人员侵略古巴
    美国正在危地马拉秘密修建机场
    新华社23日讯　洛杉矶消息：美国《洛杉矶新闻镜报》刊载编辑康·德威金斯发自危地马拉城的一则消息证实，由美国出资在危地马拉雷塔卢勒奥城修建的准备用来进攻古巴的一个大型秘密机场，已经在八十天内赶建完工。德威金斯还报道，这个可供喷气式飞机起落的飞机场警卫森严，不让人们进入。但是，危地马拉企业界人士、航空界官员和记者们都知道修建这个机场的事。
    早些时候，危地马拉舆论曾经揭露，在雷塔卢勒奥机场中，至少驻有五十名美国飞行员和一些美籍机械师。驻在这个机场的美国飞机不断把准备用来进攻古巴的武器、装备和雇佣兵从美国载运到危地马拉。
