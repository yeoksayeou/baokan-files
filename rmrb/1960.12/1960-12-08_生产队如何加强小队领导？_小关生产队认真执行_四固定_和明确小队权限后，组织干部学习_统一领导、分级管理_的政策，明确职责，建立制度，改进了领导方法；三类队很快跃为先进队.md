How Can Production Teams Strengthen Leadership of Production Brigades?
    After earnestly implementing "Four Fixes" and clarifying the authority of the production brigades, the Xiaoguan Production Team organized cadres to study the policy of "unified leadership, decentralized management," clarified responsibilities, established systems, and improved leadership methods; the third-class team quickly became an advanced team.
    (Our Dispatch) The Xiaoguan Production Team of Yizi Commune in Pan County, Guizhou, after conscientiously implementing the "Four Fixes" for the production brigades and clarifying their authority to plant according to local conditions and arrange work, discussed the leadership responsibilities, work systems, and leadership methods of the production team, so as to better exert the combat role of the production brigades.
    Before this year's autumn harvest, in order to fully leverage the initiative and enthusiasm of the production brigades in production, the Xiaoguan Production Team decided to clearly fix the team's land, labor force, draught animals, and farm tools for the use of the production brigades, and determined the brigade's various authorities in arranging production, and established various production responsibility systems for the brigades. After doing so, the production of the brigades improved greatly; however, the leadership work of the production team could not keep up for a time. Some cadres believed that since the work was arranged by the brigades, they had little to do, so they buried themselves in labor all day long and paid little attention to the work in the brigades; some cadres, after going to the brigades, discovered problems but did not dare to deal with them in a timely manner, fearing that they would infringe on the authority of the brigade cadres. How should the role of the production team level cadres be brought into play to further strengthen the leadership of the production brigades? The Party branch organized cadres above the brigade level to conscientiously study relevant documents on the "unified leadership, decentralized management" of the People's Commune, so that everyone clearly realized that giving the brigades certain authority was to better implement decentralized management, and the purpose of implementing decentralized management was to improve production. After repeated study, they stipulated that when production team level cadres go to the brigades, they must fulfill the following responsibilities: ① Participate in production and lead production; ② Actively publicize and implement the Party's policies and guidelines, help brigade cadres do a good job, and improve the leadership level of the brigade cadres; ③ Inspect and supervise the various tasks of the brigades, and discover and solve problems in a timely manner; ④ Summarize and promote advanced experience, and lead commune members to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution.
    After clarifying the above responsibilities of the production team cadres, necessary improvements were also made to the work system. The work of the production team is arranged once every ten days: the first eight days are spent participating in labor, the ninth day is spent concentrating on learning, and the tenth day is spent summarizing and evaluating the work of the past ten days, studying the work for the next ten days, and assigning new production tasks to the brigades. On the mornings of the fourth and seventh days, production team level cadres return to the team headquarters to meet and exchange information. The main benefit of implementing this work system is that it enables production team level cadres to participate in production and lead production in a down-to-earth manner, and work, study, and labor are all guaranteed by the system; the production plans and work plans formulated by the production team can be checked and arranged in stages, allowing the brigades to complete them flexibly, so as to strengthen the planning of the brigade level work.
    On the basis of determining the above work system, the production team also promoted the "study, together, contract, deep, rotate, meet, help" seven-character leadership method to urge production team level cadres to better fulfill their responsibilities.
    Study: In order to resolutely implement the Party's policies and guidelines, cadres must carefully study the Party's policies and guidelines on the day of study, so as to deeply publicize the policies to brigade cadres and commune members, and help them improve their political consciousness and understanding.
    Together: During the eight days of labor time, except for one person taking turns to be on duty at home, all other cadres go deep into the brigades, eat, live, work, and discuss together with the commune members, and participate in production and lead production.
    Contract: The seven cadres of the team are divided into twelve brigades and assigned to different areas to take responsibility. Among them, the Party branch secretary is responsible for political and ideological work, the captain and two deputy captains are each responsible for four brigades, and the two grain administrators are divided into different areas to manage each canteen.
    Deep: Go deep into the fields, deep into the canteens, deep into the masses, and make friends with poor and lower-middle peasants, so as to better understand the production and living conditions, and understand the opinions and requirements of the masses.
    Rotate: Each cadre must take time during the eight days of labor time to rotate to the brigades they are responsible for in order to grasp the situation, as a basis for evaluation on the tenth day.
    Meet: Cadres report to each other on the mornings of the fourth and seventh days of each ten-day period, and accept new tasks.
    Help: Cadres cannot issue orders in the brigades, but should respect the authority of the brigade cadres and be good advisors.
    This production team began to implement the above work system and leadership methods in late August this year. After implementation, various tasks have greatly improved, changing the face of the third-class team for several years, and becoming an advanced team in the entire commune. Their autumn grain storage work this year was completed one and a half months earlier than last year, the autumn planting task increased by 30% compared to last year, and the completion time was fifteen days earlier than last year; at present, the team's annual purchase task of agricultural and sideline products has been completed, and all the board fields that have not been planted with summer harvest crops have been plowed.

    生产队如何加强小队领导？
    小关生产队认真执行“四固定”和明确小队权限后，组织干部学习“统一领导、分级管理”的政策，明确职责，建立制度，改进了领导方法；三类队很快跃为先进队
    本报讯　贵州盘县亦资公社小关生产队，对小队认真实行“四固定”和明确小队因地种植、安排活路等权限之后，讨论了生产队的领导职责、工作制度和领导方法，以便更好地发挥小队的战斗作用。
    今年秋收前，小关生产队为了充分发挥小队在生产上的主动性和积极性，决定把全队的土地、劳力、耕畜、农具明确地固定给小队使用，并确定了小队在安排生产上的各种权限，建立了小队的各种生产责任制度。这样做之后，小队生产有很大起色；但是，生产队的领导工作却一时跟不上去。有的干部认为活路由小队安排，自己就没有多少事干了，因而成天埋头劳动，对小队里的工作过问较少；有的干部深入到小队去之后，发现了问题又不敢及时处理，怕侵犯了小队干部的职权。应当如何发挥生产队一级干部的作用，进一步加强对生产小队的领导？党支部组织小队以上的干部认真学习了有关人民公社“统一领导，分级管理”方面的一些文件，使大家清楚地认识到：给予小队一定的权限，是为了更好地实行分级管理，而实行分级管理的目的，又是为了搞好生产。经反复研究之后，他们规定生产队一级干部下到小队去的时候，必须履行以下几项职责：①参加生产领导生产；②积极宣传和贯彻党的方针政策，帮助小队干部搞好工作，提高小队干部的领导水平；③对小队的各项工作进行检查督促，及时发现问题解决问题；④总结推广先进经验，领导社员群众进行技术革新和技术革命。
    在明确了生产队干部的上述职责后，在工作制度上也作了必要的改进。生产队的工作，十天进行一次安排：前八天参加劳动，第九天集中学习，第十天将十天以来的工作进行总结评比，研究下一旬的工作，向小队布置新的生产任务。四、七两天早晨，生产队一级干部回到队部碰头交流情况。实行这一工作制度的主要好处是：使生产队一级干部能踏踏实实地参加生产领导生产，工作、学习、劳动，也都有制度作保证；生产队制订的生产计划和工作计划，能分阶段进行检查和布置，让小队机动灵活地去完成，以加强小队一级工作的计划性。
    在确定上述工作制度的基础上，生产队还推行了“学、同、包、深、转、碰、帮”七字领导方法，督促生产队一级干部更好地履行自己的职责。
    学：为了坚决执行党的方针政策，干部在学习那天，一定要认真地钻研党的方针政策，以便向小队干部和社员深入地宣传政策，帮助他们提高政治觉悟和认识水平。
    同：干部在八天的劳动时间里，除轮流由一人在家值班外，其他的干部一律深入小队，与社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，参加生产领导生产。
    包：全队七个干部，对十二个小队进行划片，分口包干。其中党支部书记包政治思想工作，队长和两个副队长各包四个小队，两个粮食管理员分工划片包管各食堂。
    深：深入田间、深入食堂、深入群众，广交贫农、下中农朋友，以便更好地了解生产、生活情况，了解群众的意见与要求。
    转：每个干部在八天的劳动时间里，要抽出一定时间到自己所包的小队里去转，以便掌握情况，作为第十天评比依据。
    碰：干部在每旬的四、七两天早晨互相汇报情况，接受新的任务。
    帮：干部在小队里不能发号施令，要尊重小队干部的职权，当好参谋。
    这个生产队是在今年8月下旬开始实行以上工作制度和领导方法的。实行后，各项工作大有起色，改变了几年来的三类队的面貌，成为全公社的先进队。他们今年的秋粮入仓工作比去年提前一个半月完成，秋种任务比去年增加30％，完成时间比去年早十五天；目前全队一年的农副产品收购任务已经完成，没有种夏收作物的板田已全部翻犁完毕。
