Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 20th. This reporter reports: Romanian industrial and agricultural workers have achieved outstanding accomplishments in their production and construction work this year—the first year of the Sixth Five-Year Plan. According to materials up to the end of November, 175 central state-owned industrial enterprises across the country have completed this year's production plans one to two months ahead of schedule. New progress has also been made in the socialist transformation of agriculture and production work.

This year, Romanian industry is developing at its fastest production speed in nearly eight years. From 1954 to 1959, Romania's industrial production grew at an average annual rate of approximately 10%. The Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulates that industrial production should grow at an average annual rate of around 13%. However, this year's industrial production is expected to exceed both of these average growth levels, as well as exceeding the original target of 14% growth for this year, and reaching 15.5%.

This year, the output value of the iron and steel industry will increase by 30% compared to last year; the absolute increase in the production of pig iron, steel, and steel products will be greater than the total annual output in 1938.

In 1960, Romania's machine manufacturing industry developed very rapidly. Its output value is expected to be nine times higher than in 1938 before liberation; the total output value of it and the metal processing industry will increase by 20% compared to last year.

The chemical industry continues to develop at a high speed, with production this year increasing by 22% compared to last year and ten times higher than in 1938. According to the implementation of this year's plan, the production of chemical fertilizers, caustic soda, and plastics will increase by 33.9%, 57%, and 77% respectively compared to last year.

The electric power industry will overfulfill the tasks stipulated in the national ten-year electrification plan this year. The plan stipulates that the country should produce 7 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity this year, but in reality, it will produce 7.7 billion kilowatt-hours. Calculated per capita, this year's electricity production will increase by 4.7 times compared to 1938.

While prioritizing the development of heavy industry, the production of consumer goods industries in Romania has also grown correspondingly this year. The textile industry will grow by 16% compared to last year, and the food industry will grow by more than 11%.

At the same time, labor productivity and the labor enthusiasm and creativity of workers in Romanian industry have greatly improved. It is expected that this year's industrial labor productivity will increase by 10.5% compared to last year, which will be the highest record in recent years.

The speed of Romania's capital construction this year is also faster than in the past. This year, a total of 116 factories and workshops were newly built, expanded, and renovated across the country.

In the first year of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the socialist transformation of agriculture in Romania has further developed. Currently, the socialist agricultural sector owns 83% of the country's cultivated land (compared to 72.2% at the end of last year); 82% of farmers nationwide have joined collective farms and other agricultural production cooperative organizations (compared to 73.5% at the end of last year). This year, more than 85% of the national grain reserves are supplied by the socialist agricultural sector. Although the natural conditions this year are not very good, the crop yields of many state farms and collective farms are still very high. According to a survey and statistics of over 110,000 hectares of wheat land in 152 state farms, the average wheat yield per hectare reached 2,000 kilograms. Among them, the wheat yield of 39 state farms averaged over 2,500 kilograms per hectare, that is, they achieved the original target of state farms' wheat yield in 1965 ahead of schedule. The collective farms in Bucharest State had more than 500 kilograms of wheat per hectare more than individual farmers this year.

In addition, the socialist agricultural sector has also made great achievements in developing animal husbandry.

As the first year of the Sixth Five-Year Plan is about to end, the Romanian working people are working selflessly to complete and overfulfill this year's production plan. They also expressed their determination to achieve greater successes in the second year of the Sixth Five-Year Plan. (Attached picture)

Currently, steel and pig iron have completed the production plan ahead of schedule. A 400-ton open-hearth furnace of the Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine, the largest metallurgical joint factory in Romania, has been put into production. The annual output of this open-hearth furnace alone will exceed Romania's national steel output in 1938.

    罗今年工农业生产获新成就
    一百七十五个中央国营企业提前完成今年计划
    农业的社会主义改造和生产工作有了新的进展
    据新华社布加勒斯特20日电本社记者报道：罗马尼亚工农业劳动者在今年——六年计划的第一年——的生产和建设工作中取得了出色的成就。根据截至11月底为止的材料，全国已有一百七十五个中央国营工业企业提前一个月到两个多月完成了今年的生产计划。农业的社会主义改造和生产工作也取得了新的进展。
    今年，罗马尼亚工业以近八年来最快的生产速度向前发展。从1954年到1959年，罗马尼亚的工业生产每年平均增长大约10％，六年计划规定，工业生产每年平均增长13％左右。但是，今年的工业生产预计将超过这两个平均增长水平，也将超过今年原订的增长14％的指标，而达到15.5％。
    今年钢铁工业的产值将比去年增长30％；生铁、钢和钢材的绝对增长量比1938年全年的产量还多。
    1960年罗马尼亚的机器制造业的发展十分迅速。预计它的产值将比解放前1938年增长九倍；它和金属加工业的总产值将比去年增长20％。
    化学工业继续以高速度向前发展，今年的生产将比去年增长22％，比1938年增长十倍。根据今年的计划执行情况，化肥、苛性钠和塑料的生产，将比去年分别提高33.9％、57％和77％。
    电力工业今年将超额完成国家十年电气化计划所规定的任务。计划规定，今年全国应生产七十亿度电力，但实际上将生产七十七亿度。按全国人口平均计算，今年的电力产量将比1938年增加四点七倍。
    在优先发展重工业的同时，今年罗马尼亚的消费品工业的生产也有相应的增长。纺织工业将比去年增长16％，食品工业将增长11％以上。
    与此同时，罗马尼亚工业中的劳动生产率和职工的劳动积极性和创造性有了很大的提高。预计，今年的工业劳动生产率将比去年提高10.5％，这将是近几年来的最高纪录。
    罗马尼亚今年的基本建设的速度同样比过去加快了。今年全国共新建、扩建和改建一百一十六个工厂和车间。
    在六年计划的第一年中，罗马尼亚农业社会主义改造有了进一步的发展。目前，社会主义农业部门已拥有全国耕地的83％（而去年年底是72.2％）；全国已有82％的农户加入了集体农庄等农业生产合作组织（而在去年年底是73.5％）。今年，国家粮食储备的85％以上都是由社会主义农业部门供给的。虽然今年的自然条件不很好，但是，各地有不少国营农场和集体农庄的作物产量仍然很高。根据对一百五十二个国营农场的十一万多公顷小麦地的调查统计，平均每公顷小麦产量达二千公斤。其中，有三十九个国营农场的小麦产量，平均每公顷达到二千五百公斤以上，即提前达到了原订的国营农场1965年小麦产量指标。布加勒斯特州的集体农庄今年每公顷小麦产量，比个体农民多五百多公斤。
    此外，社会主义农业部门在发展畜牧业方面也取得了很大的成绩。
    在六年计划的第一年即将结束的时候，罗马尼亚劳动人民正在再接再厉，为完成和超额完成今年的生产计划而忘我劳动。他们并表示决心，要在六年计划的第二年取得更大的成就。（附图片）
    今年，是罗马尼亚六年计划（一九六○至一九六五）的第一年，罗马尼亚的钢铁生产的形势很好，目前钢和生铁已经提前完成了生产计划。罗马尼亚最大冶金联合工厂洪尼多阿拉冶金联合企业的一座四百吨大平炉已经投入生产，仅这座平炉的年产量就将超过一九三八年罗马尼亚全国的钢产量。图为洪尼多阿拉冶金联合企业新建四百吨平炉车间的一角。  罗马尼亚通讯社稿（新华社发）
