Reported by Liaoning Daily: In this year's coal production, Pang Guanxiang, production team leader, and Li Shuming, deputy team leader, Guo Jingtang, team leader, and Feng Zhanru, deputy team leader, of the first production team of the sixth district of Fushun Laohutai Mine, united the masses and took the lead in everything. In front of them, there were no faces that could not be mined, and no difficulties that could not be overcome. Under their leadership, the entire team achieved the glorious title of High-Yield Pioneer Team of the Fushun Mining Area with an excellent output of 1,000 tons per day. They themselves were unanimously praised by the masses as the "Four Capable Generals" on the coal mining front, becoming role models for the vast number of miners to learn from and catch up with.

The "Four Capable Generals" have always listened to the Party, treated the mine as their home, worked hard, and were courageous and resourceful. Each of them has their own characteristics and strengths. They are willing to overcome all difficulties for the cause of the Party and the people. As long as the Party issues an order, they will go wherever it points.

Pang Guanxiang, the Daring and Capable

The first "Capable General" is Pang Guanxiang, a representative of the National People's Congress and a national advanced producer. Over the past few years, he has made more than 20 innovations, including increasing mining height and deep drilling, which have been spread throughout the Fushun Mining Area. This year, he continued to innovate, leading the entire team to comprehensively promote the fourteen advanced experiences he had created over the years, such as deep drilling, side-support sheds, and artificial inclination, making the entire team the first to raise the banner of large-area high-yield production in the entire mining area.

Steel production requires more coal, and the Party committee called for improving the utilization rate of working faces, working hours, and equipment. The daring and capable Pang Guanxiang was determined to take the lead in breaking through this barrier by innovating drilling and blasting techniques. When it came to drilling, Lao Pang was already a recognized expert, but it was not easy to take another step forward on the existing level. He went down to the working face to find various angles for experiments and summarized different experiences and lessons with everyone. He believed:

"Coal is dead, but people are alive. As long as you understand the temperament of coal, you are not afraid that it will not increase production." After repeated observation and experimentation, Pang Guanxiang finally created a new technology of increasing hole spacing and deep-hole blasting. After this new technology was quickly promoted throughout the team, drilling man-hours were shortened by half, blasting efficiency was doubled, coal production increased by one-third, and explosives and pit props were greatly saved.

Li Shuming, Always Taking on Difficulties

Communist Party member Li Shuming is an excellent drilling worker. Every day when he comes to the mine, he holds on to the electric drill and never lets go. He seizes every opportunity to do whatever he can. However, what is most admirable is his heroic nature of not being afraid of difficulties and taking the initiative to undertake them.

When mining coal underground, natural conditions change a lot. Relying on years of experience and a high sense of responsibility, Li Shuming often takes the lead in eliminating various difficulties. When equipment is buried during backfilling, it will be lost if you are not careful. No matter how difficult it is, Li Shuming must retrieve it completely. When shoveling coal, residual coal is often pressed under the bottom and the chute. Some people complain that picking it up is too much work. He said, "It is not easy to mine the coal, and not a single piece can be lost." He often takes the lead in doing it himself.

Once, while everyone was mining coal, the pipe gallery above suddenly collapsed, and the ventilation of the upper and lower working faces was blocked at the same time, forcing production to stop. The team leader sent five workers to deal with it, but nothing was achieved after four shifts. Regardless of the danger and high temperature, Li Shuming bravely climbed into the gap that could barely accommodate him and dug coal out with his bare hands. He opened a small hole and then dug with a pick. He advanced one foot and then dug another foot. Before a shift was over, a fresh breeze finally came from the upper end of the pipe gallery. The ventilation passages of the two working faces were opened by the veteran general with amazing perseverance.

Another time, the team opened the side twice in a row. Just as they were about to go up the well after handing over the shift, they suddenly heard that there was a lot of stone in the first coal face of the Zhou Yanlin team, and they couldn't drill the holes. Li Shuming looked at the situation, picked up the electric drill, and started drilling. Although the conditions were bad and the rock was hard, it could not withstand the veteran general's experience and energy, and he quickly helped drill rows of blast holes.

Guo Jingtang, the Energetic and Lively

The young and strong Guo Jingtang is an impatient person. As soon as the Party called for increasing coal production, he immediately rolled up his sleeves, stretched out his arms, and said decisively: "No problem, we can produce as much as you want!" Xiao Guo is not only energetic but also bold and careful.

He is the team leader who can best calculate the utilization of working hours and manpower. At the pit-front meeting every day, he first gets a clear picture of the working face conditions with the team leader of the previous shift, and then explains the situation and makes arrangements to everyone while formulating plans and finding measures on this basis, so that everyone knows what to do. Once the plan is set, as they change their clothes and prepare to go down the pit, he assigns people without missing anything. When they arrive at the working face, everyone immediately takes their positions and works hard.

In the working face, which is as long as forty meters from east to west, Guo Jingtang wields his big shovel like a bulldozer; wielding an axe, he can build a shed in a dozen minutes. He not only takes the lead in doing the most critical work, but also mobilizes everyone's strength according to their characteristics. For those who are willing to work hard, he delegates specific tasks and gives full play to their initiative. Therefore, within eight hours, everyone strives to be the first, and the work processes are closely linked. The sound of explosions is constant in the working face, and the coal in the chute always pours down like a tide.

The natural conditions of the coal mining working face are ever-changing. Relying on his unique wit and bravery, Guo Jingtang can foresee dangers and rely on everyone to prepare at any time and anywhere. Once, the pressure on the roof of the chute suddenly increased, breaking three sheds in a row. As soon as Guo Jingtang saw it, he immediately evacuated everyone to a safe place and came to set up props himself. After the danger was blocked, he turned around and mobilized everyone to cross-operate and speed up the progress. Originally, it looked like the task was about to be unfinished, but the result was a big overproduction.

Guo Jingtang's team often finds the strongest opponents at the pit-front meeting to compete, but few people surpass them. Therefore, his partners gave him the nickname "Energetic and Lively" Capable General.

Feng Zhanru, the All-Rounder Capable General

One night, due to the vibration of natural coal cannons, a roof collapse suddenly occurred in the working face. When the news came, the tall veteran worker Feng Zhanru put on his coat and flew to the mine.

Gray coal was falling in bursts, and new coal cannons were likely to continue to attack. As soon as Master Feng saw the situation, he immediately assigned manpower, picked up the pit props, and entered the working face. He swung his axe, erected a vertical column; stretched out his arms, and put on a beam. He continued to lead people to seize the time to dig nests and pull the bottom. In the collapsed area, he skillfully and quickly built a wooden pile. Finally, he used double-gun wooden brakes to help and duck-bill sheds to seal the top tightly, which not only allowed the coal mining to quickly resume normal operations, but also eliminated the need to worry about a larger coal cannon.

Feng Zhanru had been in the mine for less than nine years since he came from the countryside, but he had long been famous for his technical skills. He was originally a prop carpenter, but he quickly became proficient in drilling, blasting, shoveling, and laying chutes. He can do any job underground, so he has become a recognized all-rounder in the team.

Because he has mastered a variety of technologies and has the quality of treating the mine as his home, he not only takes the lead in everything, but also consciously undertakes the important task of cultivating new forces. On the working face, where the headlamps are flashing and various operations such as drilling, shoveling coal, pulling the bottom, and blasting are carried out rhythmically, people can often see the all-rounder Capable General Feng Zhanru enthusiastically teaching apprentices to learn various technologies. Sometimes, he demonstrates and explains at the same time; sometimes, the apprentice does it first, and he corrects it; sometimes, he even holds their hands and repeatedly instructs them.

Over the past few years, the all-rounder Capable General Feng Zhanru has taught the most apprentices in the team. Last year and this year, he and his apprentices were twice named model teachers and apprentices in the Laohutai Mine and Fushun Mining Area.

Everyone Catches Up with, Learns From, and Strives to Become Capable Generals

The reputation of the four Capable Generals of the first team of the sixth district quickly spread throughout the mine. The mine Party committee immediately seized this trend of the masses consciously selecting capable generals and catching up with advanced individuals, and promoted everyone to catch up with, learn from, and strive to become capable generals everywhere, in order to contribute to increasing coal production. Soon, capable generals and heroes emerged from the mine to the district and even to various teams. The mine's coal production increased day by day, and the mass competition entered a new stage. Under the leadership of the Party, inspired and promoted by the leading practical work of the four Capable Generals, the workers of the first team of the sixth district were ambitious and motivated, and eight more skilled workers and ten model workers emerged in addition to the four Capable Generals, quickly uniting more than 120 people in the team around these core members and advancing side by side. Therefore, while praising the four Capable Generals, people also always praise the first team of the sixth district as an invincible steel team. (Photo attached)

    团结群众奋勇前进　党指向哪里就干到哪里
    老虎台矿四大“干将”事事带头
    全矿开展学“干将”赶“干将”争当“干将”群众运动原煤产量日增
    本报讯　据辽宁日报消息：抚顺老虎台矿六区一班生产组长庞观祥、副组长李树明，组长郭景堂、副组长冯占儒，在今年的煤炭生产中团结群众，事事带头；在他们面前，没有采不了的掌子，没有突不破的难关。全班在他们带动下，以日产千吨的优异成绩取得了抚顺矿区高产先锋班的光荣称号；他们自己，则被群众一致称颂为采煤前线的“四大干将”，成为广大矿工学习、追赶的榜样。
    “四大干将”一向听党的话，以矿为家，埋头苦干，有勇有谋。他们各有特点，各有所长，为党和人民的事业不辞万难，只要党的一声号令，指到哪里就干到哪里。
  敢想敢干的　庞观祥
    第一个“干将”是全国人民代表大会代表和全国先进生产者庞观祥。几年来，他的革新创造多达二十余种，其中加大采高、深打眼等经验都已传遍抚顺矿区。今年来，他继续大搞革新，带动全班把几年来创造的深打眼、靠帮棚子、人造倾斜度等十四项先进经验配套成龙，综合推广，使全班在全矿区首先举起大面积丰产红旗。
    钢铁生产需要更多的煤炭，党委号召提高工作面、工时和设备利用率。敢想敢干的庞观祥立志从革新打眼、爆破技术上带头突破这一关。论打眼，老庞已是公认的专家，但是在现有的水平上再跃进一步，却并不是容易的事情。他下井到掌子里找各种角度进行试验，和大家总结不同的经验教训。他认定：
  “煤是死的，人是活的，只要摸透煤的脾气，不怕它不增产。”经过反复观察、试验，庞观祥终于创造出加大眼距、深孔爆破的新技术。这项新技术迅速在全班推广后，使打眼工时缩短一半，爆破效率提高一倍，煤炭产量增长三分之一，火药、坑木大大节省。
  见困难就上的　李树明
    共产党员李树明，是个出色的打眼工。每天来到井下，抱起电钻不离手，有了空闲样样抢着干。可是，最令人敬佩的，还是他那种不怕困难和主动承担困难的英雄本色。
    在井下采煤，自然条件变化多，李树明靠着多年的经验和高度责任感，经常领先排除各种困难。充填时埋住了设备，一马虎就会丢掉，李树明不管多么困难，也要一件不短地把它收回。攉煤时，下帮和溜子底下经常压住残煤，有人嫌拣起来费工，他说“好容易采下的煤，一块也不能丢掉”，经常亲自带头干。
    有一次，大家正在采煤，斜上管子道突然冒顶了，上下两个掌子的通风同时受阻，被迫停止了生产。班长派出五名工人前去处理，做了四个小班没有结果。李树明不顾艰险，冒着高温，勇敢地爬进刚能容身的缝隙，赤手往外扒煤；扒开了小洞，再用镐刨。进了一尺，再扒一尺。没过一个小班，终于从管子道上端传来了清风，两个掌子的通风孔道被老干将用惊人的毅力给打通了。
    另一回，本组一连开了两遍帮，交完班正要升井，忽然听说周延林小组采头一幅煤时夹石多，打不出眼来，李树明看了看情况，抱起电钻就哒哒哒地打起眼来。尽管条件坏，岩石硬，却抵不过老干将的经验和干劲，很快就帮助打出了成排的炮眼。
  生龙活虎的　郭景堂
    年青力壮的郭景堂是个急性子，党一号召增产煤炭，马上把袖子一挽，胳膊一伸，斩钉截铁地说：“没有问题，要多少有多少！”小郭不仅干劲大，而且胆大心细。
    他是个最能算计着利用工时和人力的组长。每天坑前会上，他先和上班组长把掌子情况摸准，然后一边向大家讲形势、作交代，一边在这个基础上订计划、找措施，叫大家心中有数。计划一定，随着换衣服准备下井，就事事不漏地把人分配好。来到掌子，马上各就各位，大干特干。
    在东西长达四十米的掌子里，郭景堂抡起大锹活像开动了推土机；操起斧子，十几分钟就是一架棚子。他不仅挑最关键的活带头干，还能针对每个人的特点调动大家的力量。对于那些埋头肯干的人，就放手交代具体任务，充分发挥他们的主动性。因此，八小时内，人人奋勇当先，工序工种紧紧相连，掌子里炮声不断，溜子里的煤炭始终像潮水一样倾泻奔流。
    采煤掌子的自然条件千变万化，郭景堂靠着特有的机智勇敢，能够预知险情，更能依靠大家随时随地作好准备。有次，溜子口顶板压力突然增大，一连压断三架棚子。郭景堂一看，马上把大家撤退到安全地方，自己来打顶子、棚棚，险情挡住以后，转身又发动大家交叉作业抢进度，原来眼看着要完不成任务，结果却来了个大超产。
    郭景堂小组经常在坑前会上找最强的对手叫劲比武，结果却很少有人超过他们。这样，伙伴们给他送了个绰号叫“生龙活虎”的干将。
  多面手干将　冯占儒
    一天深夜，掌子里由于自然煤炮的震动，突然发生了冒顶。消息传来，高个子老师傅冯占儒披上外衣，飞步来到了井下。
    灰煤正在阵阵下落，新的煤炮很可能继续袭来。冯师傅一看情况，立即分配了一下人力，拿起坑木就进了掌子。斧头一抡，竖起立柱；臂膀一伸，上起梁子。又继续领人抓紧刨窝子、拉底，在冒顶的地方，机智快速地打起了木垛。最后，以双枪木刹帮，用鸭嘴棚刹密顶，不只使采煤迅速恢复了正常作业，就是再来个更大的煤炮也用不着耽心了。
    冯占儒从农村进矿还不到九年，可是在技术上很早就名声出众了。他原是支柱木匠，但是很快就作到了打眼、放炮、攉锹、铺溜子样样精通。井下不论什么活，他都能做，因此，成为全班公认的多面手。
    由于他掌握了多种技术，又具有以矿为家的品质，他不只是自己事事带头干，而且能自觉地承担起培养新生力量的重担。在头灯闪闪，打眼、攉煤、拉底、放炮等各项作业有节奏进行的工作面上，人们经常可以看到多面手干将冯占儒热心教徒弟学习各种技术的情景。有时，一边示范一边讲解；有时，徒弟先干，他给纠正；有时甚至手把着手，反复指点。
    几年来，多面手干将冯占儒在班内教的徒弟最多，去年和今年曾和徒弟一起两次被评为老虎台矿和抚顺矿区的师徒模范。
  人人赶干将、学干将、
    争取当干将
    六区一班四大干将的名声很快在全矿叫响，矿党委立即抓住这一群众自觉选拔干将、追赶先进的苗头，推动人人处处赶干将、学干将、争取当干将，为增产煤炭立功。很快，从矿到区以至各班，点将台上干将辈出，英雄林立，全矿煤炭产量日增，群众竞赛进入新的阶段。而六区一班职工，在党的领导下，在四大干将带头实干的鼓舞、推动下，人人向上，雄心勃勃，在四大干将之外，又接连涌现出八大能手、十大标兵，迅速把全班一百二十多人团结在这批骨干分子的周围，并肩跃进。所以，人们在称赞四大干将的同时，也总称赞六区一班为战无不胜的钢铁班。（附图片）
