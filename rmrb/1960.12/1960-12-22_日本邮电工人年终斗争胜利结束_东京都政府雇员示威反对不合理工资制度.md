    The All Japan Postal Workers' Union, with over 220,000 members, won a victory in its year-end struggle thanks to the solidarity of all its members and its persistence in fighting for nearly half a month. On the morning of the 10th, the union forced the postal authorities to accept the workers' demand for year-end allowances equivalent to more than two months' wages.

    The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications was also forced to agree to promote 18,000 of the 22,000 temporary workers to permanent positions.

    Meanwhile, the National Telecommunications Workers' Union, with more than 160,000 members, also achieved victory in its struggle. On the evening of the 9th, the union forced management to agree to pay workers year-end allowances equivalent to two months' wages and to pay overtime.

    On the 15th, 15,000 Tokyo Metropolitan Government employees held a demonstration against the government's announced new wage system. The area near the Tokyo Metropolitan Government was crowded with demonstrators all day.
