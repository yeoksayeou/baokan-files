Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 29th – Cuban newspapers today published a letter from Cuban Foreign Minister Raúl Roa to the United Nations Secretary-General. The letter states that the Cuban government insists on submitting Cuba's accusations against the United States for discussion by the United Nations General Assembly.

Roa's letter refutes the unreasonable arguments of the United States - that Cuba is obligated to bring its dispute with another American country to the Organization of American States, which is manipulated by the United States, for resolution.

Roa's letter lists a series of aggressive actions by the US government against Cuba and Caribbean countries to refute the US slander: that "Cuba is using its unfounded accusations against the United States to justify its purchase of weapons and military preparations." Roa's letter points out that "President Eisenhower's government has given Cuba the only choice of submission or being crushed." "Faced with this intimidating, aggressive, and interventionist policy, the Cuban revolutionary government has no need to conceal its mobilization of the people and its defense arrangements with fabricated accusations."

Roa's letter states that the Cuban government requests the Security Council to distribute this letter as an official document to all delegations.

    劳尔·罗亚致函哈马舍尔德
    驳斥美国对古巴的诽谤
    坚持要求联大讨论古巴的控告
    据新华社哈瓦那29日电　古巴报纸今天发表了古巴外交部长劳尔·罗亚给联合国秘书长的信。这封信说，古巴政府坚持把古巴对美国的控告提交联合国大会讨论。
    罗亚的信驳斥了美国的无理声辩——说什么古巴有义务把自己和另一个美洲国家的纠纷提到美国操纵的美洲国家组织中去解决。
    罗亚的信列举了美国政府对古巴和加勒比海国家的一系列侵略行动来驳斥美国的这种诽谤：说什么
  “古巴在利用它对美国的无端控告来为自己购买武器和进行军事准备辩护”。罗亚的信指出，“艾森豪威尔总统的政府给古巴提出的唯一抉择就是屈服或是被打垮”。“面对着这种恫吓、侵略性和干涉主义的政策，古巴革命政府没有必要用臆造出来的控告来掩饰它对人民的动员和对国防的安排”。
    罗亚的信说，古巴政府要求安理会把这封信作为一个正式文件分发给所有的代表团。
