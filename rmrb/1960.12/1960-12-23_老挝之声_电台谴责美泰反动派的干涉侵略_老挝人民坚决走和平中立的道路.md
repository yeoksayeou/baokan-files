Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 21st: The "Voice of Laos" radio station of the Lao legitimate government, in a commentary broadcast on the evening of the 20th, pointed out that for the survival of the Lao nation, the current task of the Lao nation is: to resolutely unite and struggle, to implement the Geneva Agreements, to realize a policy of peace and neutrality, to resolutely oppose the interference and aggression of US imperialism and the Thai reactionaries, and to smash all traitorous conspiracies of the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique.

The commentary pointed out that the glorious path of the Lao nation is the path of peace, neutrality, and national harmony. The Lao people resolutely oppose the path of expanding the civil war and turning Laos into a US colony by the United States and its lackeys, the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak traitorous clique.

The commentary pointed out that the policy line clearly announced by the Souvanna Phouma government is: to realize national harmony and implement a peaceful and neutral line based on the five principles. This policy line is correct, it is in line with the situation in Laos and the current international situation, and it is in line with the requirements and deep desires of all the Lao people and peace-loving people of the world.

The commentary pointed out that the serious crisis in Laos is the result of direct aggression by US imperialism, the Thai reactionary group, and other reactionary forces.

The commentary then pointed out that US imperialism shamelessly announced: the US position is to ensure that Laos must establish a government including almost all anti-communist figures, Laos' policy must be leaning towards the West, and Laos must absolutely not establish relations with Eastern countries. The US imperialism and its lackey, the Thai reactionary forces and the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique, attacked Vientiane in an attempt to overthrow the Lao legitimate government, which pursued a policy of peace, neutrality, and national harmony, and to brutally undermine the path chosen by all the Lao people.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 21st: The Lao Fighting Units Radio broadcast tonight: Soldiers of a certain company of the Second Battalion of the Lao Fighting Units held a meeting on the 18th to commemorate December 13, the "Day of National Hatred" when the enemy attacked Vientiane. At this meeting, they angrily condemned the crimes of US imperialism and its servants, the Thai reactionaries, in invading Laos, and the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak traitorous clique in attacking Vientiane, and unanimously expressed their determination to turn hatred into strength and resolutely fight US imperialism, the Thai reactionaries, and the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique to the end.

The meeting also passed a telegram to the government troops commanded by Captain Kong Le, expressing their welcome to their heroic fighting spirit in the struggle to defend Vientiane.

The telegram finally stated that under the leadership of the legitimate government with Prince Souvanna Phouma as Prime Minister, we will fight side by side against the common enemies - US imperialism, the Thai reactionaries and the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique. Our army and people's struggle for national salvation will surely be victorious.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 22nd: According to the "Voice of Laos" radio broadcast today: After US imperialism, the Thai reactionaries, and the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak traitorous clique occupied Vientiane, they are carrying out a large-scale suppression and persecution of the patriotic people of Vientiane.

The broadcast said that according to residents who escaped from Vientiane, the traitorous clique has arrested and imprisoned more than a thousand patriots. The broadcast said that the people of Laos resolutely condemn the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique for brutally suppressing the patriotic people of Vientiane.
