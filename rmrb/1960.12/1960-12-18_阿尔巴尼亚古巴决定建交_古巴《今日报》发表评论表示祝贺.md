Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, December 15th: According to reports in the local press, the Government of the People's Republic of Albania and the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Cuba have reached an agreement to establish diplomatic relations and exchange ambassadors extraordinary and plenipotentiary.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, December 16th: The newspaper "Hoy" published a commentary today, warmly congratulating Cuba and Albania on the establishment of diplomatic relations.

The commentary stated that the Cuban people are familiar with this distant mountain country, the outpost of socialism in Europe. The Cuban people know that this is a country that lost hundreds of thousands of its sons and daughters in the anti-fascist war, a country that resisted the pressure from the leaders of a neighbor who betrayed socialism. Albania, like other countries in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, defends the peace and independence of all countries.

The commentary wished further development of the friendly relations between the two countries. The commentary pointed out that although Cuba and Albania are far apart, they are both small countries with great people, and in these respects, the two countries are very similar.

    阿尔巴尼亚古巴决定建交
    古巴《今日报》发表评论表示祝贺
    据新华社地拉那15日电　据此间报纸报道，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府和古巴共和国革命政府已达成协议，决定建立外交关系，并互派特命全权大使级的代表。
    新华社哈瓦那16日电　《今日报》今天发表评论，热烈祝贺古巴和阿尔巴尼亚建立外交关系。
    评论说，古巴人民熟悉这个社会主义在欧洲的前哨的遥远的山国。古巴人民知道，这是一个在反法西斯战争中曾经失去了数十万儿女的国家，这个国家抵抗了一个背叛了社会主义的邻国的领导人的压力。阿尔巴尼亚正像以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的其他国家一样，保卫着各国的和平和独立。
    评论祝两国之间的友好关系取得进一步的发展。评论指出，古巴和阿尔巴尼亚虽然相隔很远，但是它们都是小国而又都有着伟大的人民，在这些方面两国是很相近的。
