Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, December 28th. According to a report in the Swiss newspaper *La Voix Ouvrière* on the 27th, the First Secretary of the Algerian Communist Party, Bouhali, recently told journalists covering African French-language programs in Prague that the recent anti-French patriotic struggles waged by the people in the French-occupied areas of Algeria "clearly demonstrate the Algerian people's unyielding resistance to the bloody colonial system, while also confirming their solidarity and resolute support for their national liberation army and their own Provisional Government (of the Algerian Republic)."

In response to a question about De Gaulle's planned "referendum" fraud, Bouhali said that as soon as De Gaulle's "referendum" was announced, the Algerian Communist Party immediately declared it a "new infringement on Algeria's right to freely handle its own affairs, and an attack on its territorial integrity and national unity." He said that this "referendum, which excludes negotiations with the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic and completely opposes the principle of self-determination, will not be in the interests of the Algerian and French people." He pointed out that De Gaulle's "referendum" will suffer the same fate as previous election frauds in France.

When discussing the situation in the UN Political Committee regarding the Algerian question, he condemned the support of the North Atlantic bloc countries, headed by US imperialism, for French colonialism. He said, "It is precisely because of the support and assistance of the North Atlantic bloc that French imperialism has been able to continue its war of extermination against our people."

He continued, after the UN General Assembly passed a proposal demanding recognition of the Algerian people's right to self-determination and independence, the most important thing now is to fight resolutely. He said that the Algerian people will be even more determined in their liberation struggle. "What we hope is that the support our people receive around the world will continue to expand and strengthen."

He pointed out, "From now on, the most important thing is to prepare for a huge battle to resist De Gaulle's referendum. It is important to ensure that this referendum suffers a crushing defeat."

    阿尔及利亚共产党第一书记布哈利说
    阿人民将坚决抵制戴高乐的“公民投票”
    法占区斗争证实人民对临时政府的坚决支持
    据新华社日内瓦28日电　据瑞士《工人之声报》27日报道，阿尔及利亚共产党第一书记布哈利最近在布拉格向对非洲的法文节目的记者发表谈话说，阿尔及利亚法占区人民最近展开的反法爱国斗争“清楚地证实了阿尔及利亚人民对血腥的殖民制度的不屈的反抗，同时也证实他们的团结和对自己的民族解放军和自己的（阿尔及利亚共和国）临时政府的坚决支持”。
    布哈利在回答关于戴高乐计划举行的“公民投票”骗局时说，戴高乐的“公民投票”一经公布，阿尔及利亚共产党就马上宣布这是对“阿尔及利亚自由地处理自己问题的权利的新侵犯，是对它的领土完整和全国统一的打击”。他说，这项“排斥同阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府进行谈判和彻底反对自决原则的公民投票，将不符合阿尔及利亚人民和法国人民的利益”。他指出，戴高乐的这次“公民投票”将遭到法国前几次选举骗局同样的命运。
    他在谈到联合国政治委员会讨论关于阿尔及利亚问题的情况时，谴责了以美帝国主义为首的北大西洋集团各国对法国殖民主义的支持。他说，“法国帝国主义正是由于北大西洋集团的支持援助才得以继续进行它的反对我国人民的灭绝战争。”
    他接着说，在联合国大会全体会议通过要求承认阿尔及利亚人民的自决和独立权利的提案以后，现在最重要的是要坚决战斗。他说，阿尔及利亚人民将在他们的解放斗争中更加斗志昂扬。“我们所希望的就是我国人民在全世界得到的支持不断扩大和加强”。
    他指出，“从现在起，最重要的是必须准备进行抵制戴高乐公民投票的巨大战斗。重要的是要使这次公民投票遭到惨败”。
