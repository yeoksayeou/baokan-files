Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 27th. To cultivate qualified reserve forces for the steel front, the graduating class students of Tianjin Metallurgical Industrial School are conducting on-site teaching at the forefront of steel production, accompanied by their teachers, with excellent results.

The school's four majors—steelmaking, steel rolling, machinery, and electrical installation—will have their first batch of students graduating next summer. In order to train these students into qualified reserve forces on the steel front, the school has adopted a measure of vigorously carrying out on-site teaching combined with productive labor. In early October, it organized more than 300 graduating students and teachers to go to fifteen workshops in various steel plants in Tianjin that are aligned with their majors. They participated in certain productive labor according to the teaching plan, and conducted flexible and diverse on-site teaching in conjunction with the workshop's technology and equipment.

In order to link theory with production reality, the school's teachers, workers, and technicians formed "three-way combination" teaching and research groups. In addition to working alongside the students and conducting on-site teaching, the teachers also scheduled time to lecture the students. At the same time, factory leaders and innovation experts were invited to give students political lessons and introduce their experiences. Students exchanged experiences at various technical seminars held before and after shifts.

Due to the flexible and diverse teaching methods and the vivid and practical teaching content, the students' enthusiasm for learning is very high. In the past two months, through lively on-site teaching, the students' knowledge has become increasingly solid. For example, students majoring in steelmaking have initially mastered the entire set of operating techniques from adding molten iron to slagging and tapping steel. Many students have also initially learned more complex techniques such as "observing the flame." Many workers enthusiastically impart their years of production experience to the students. The students' theoretical knowledge has also deepened as it has been confirmed by practice. For example, after working in the workshop and listening to the masters' lectures, steelmaking students understood that the theory of blowing must be combined with objective conditions such as the age of the furnace and the quality of the ingredients, consolidating and improving the results of their studies. The students worked with the workers and witnessed their enthusiastic energy, which greatly stimulated their motivation and initiative in learning. Many students have worked harder and diligently studied various technical theories, and more than 100 students have been able to link theory with practice and write one or two technical research reports.

### 培养合格的钢铁战线后备军  天津冶金工业学校毕业班学生到现场进行教学

    培养合格的钢铁战线后备军
    天津冶金工业学校毕业班学生到现场进行教学
    新华社天津27日电　天津冶金工业学校毕业班的学生在教师带领下，到钢铁生产第一线进行现场教学，收效很好。
    这座工业学校的炼钢、轧钢、机械与电气安装四个专业，明年暑期将有第一批学生毕业。为了把这批学生培养成合格的钢铁战线上的后备军，学校采取了结合生产劳动大搞现场教学的措施，在10月上旬，组织毕业班的三百多名学生和教师，分别到天津各钢铁厂的十五个与专业对口的车间，一面根据教学计划参加一定的生产劳动；一面结合车间的工艺与设备，进行灵活多样的现场教学。
    为了做到理论联系生产实际，学校教师与工人、技术员组成了“三结合”的教研组，教师除了跟班劳动，现场教学以外，并安排时间给学生讲课；同时邀请工厂领导干部和革新能手给学生上政治课和介绍经验。学生们在班前班后召开的各种形式技术座谈会上，互相交流经验。
    由于教学形式灵活多样，教学内容生动实际，因而学生学习情绪十分高涨。两个多月来，通过生动活泼的现场教学，学生们所学的知识越来越巩固。如炼钢专业的学生已初步掌握了从加铁水到扒渣出钢的整套操作技术，有不少学生还初步学会了“看火”等较为复杂的技术。许多工人都热情地把自己多年摸索到的生产经验传授给学生。学生的理论知识由于得到了实践的印证，也更加深。如炼钢专业的学生在车间劳动和听师傅们讲课后，懂得了吹炼理论必须与炉子的新旧和配料的质量等客观条件相结合等实际生产知识，巩固与提高了学习的成果。学生们同工人一起劳动，亲眼看到工人们热火朝天的干劲，也大大激发了学习上的进取心和自觉性，许多学生以加倍的努力，刻苦钻研各种技术理论，有一百多名学生还能理论联系实际，分别写出了一两篇技术研究报告。
