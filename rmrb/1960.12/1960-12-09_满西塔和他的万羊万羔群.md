    Manxita and His Flock of Ten Thousand Sheep and Lambs
    By Our Reporter Jiang Heyuan
    Manxita, a national youth socialist construction activist, a model on the Qinghai Province animal husbandry front, a famous Tibetan shepherd, and a Communist Party member, has again achieved full mating and pregnancy for the ten thousand ewes he leads this year. Currently, these ewes are fat and strong, each with a bulging belly, and some have already begun to lamb.
    In late October, when we braved the heavy snow to reach the autumn pasture of Manxita's sheep flock in the Qilian Mountains, he was holding the sheep on a large cliff slope. Although the heavy snow had submerged the entire grassland, the sheep could still use their mouths to remove the snow from the cross-section of the cliff slope and eat the pasture with relish. This year, the snow in the Qilian Mountains came exceptionally early, and the mountains were covered by heavy snow in October. However, thanks to the snow-clearing grazing methods adopted by all the shepherds, adhering to following the flock during the day, taking turns guarding the pens at night, checking the pens, and strictly implementing various pregnancy protection measures, not a single ewe has miscarried or lost weight so far. Manxita told us with full confidence: full mating, full pregnancy, full birth, full survival, and full growth are the five keys to ensuring the high-speed reproduction of sheep. With the foundation of full mating and full pregnancy, striving for full birth, full survival, and full growth is not difficult.
    Everyone Strives to Learn Advanced Experience
    Manxita is an outstanding shepherd from the First Production Team of Sujitan Commune in Menyuan Hui Autonomous County. He is now also a member of the Commune Party Committee, Deputy Director of the Commune, and Secretary of the Commune Youth League Committee. Previously, on the Qinghai grasslands, every hundred eligible ewes could breed and raise sixty to seventy lambs a year, which was considered a bumper year. However, the ewes he herds always have a breeding and survival rate of over 100% (including some ewes giving birth to twins), regardless of how harsh and changeable the climatic conditions are. In 1958, the breeding and survival rate of the seven hundred ewes he herded reached 110%; in 1959, the breeding and survival rate of the three thousand ewes he led in herding exceeded 100%. Some shepherds praised Manxita in folk songs: "There is a Manxita in Sujitan Commune, no one can compare with him in herding sheep: the sheep flock is like his heart and flesh, diligent legs and skillful hands, wholeheartedly loving the commune like home."
    Initially, some people thought that the high breeding and survival rate of Manxita's sheep flock was due to his "good luck." Others believed that Manxita had good sheep and abundant grass, so of course the breeding and survival rate would be high. After the lambing season ended this spring, when the three thousand ewes led by Manxita created a large group of bumper production records of three thousand and one hundred lambs surviving under the same conditions as other sheep flocks, these people had to be convinced.
    Manxita's new achievement has also inspired more shepherds, who said: Under the same leadership of the Party, if Manxita can do it, why can't I? Many shepherds exchanged experiences, studied measures, and put forward the resounding slogan of "Learn from, Catch up with, and Surpass Manxita." "Join Manxita's team!" "Let Manxita lead our bumper production group!" has become the common desire of the majority of shepherds. Taking advantage of the opportunity of weaning lambs and adjusting sheep flocks, the entire team established a total of thirty-three high-yield sheep groups, with a total of ten thousand eligible ewes. At everyone's urgent request, the production team's Party branch decided to hand over these high-yield groups to Manxita for leadership and named them the Communist Youth League High-Yield Sheep Team.
    Relying on the Infinite Wisdom of the Masses
    Manxita often says to people: "I don't have anything, experience is created by everyone. I am just concentrating everyone's experience according to the instructions of the Party, and then implementing it." He relies on the leadership of the Party and the wisdom of the masses everywhere, and victoriously executes the tasks assigned to him by the Party.
    To achieve high-yield production for tens of thousands of ewes, the fundamental key lies in how to make these ewes fat and strong, fully mated and pregnant. "Sheep rely on people to herd, fatness relies on grass to grow." Manxita often thought this way: summer and autumn are good times for ewes to gain weight, and there should be large pastures; winter and spring are the seasons for ewes to lamb and breastfeed, and there must be sufficient winter and spring pastures. How to expand the summer and autumn pastures as much as possible while ensuring sufficient winter and spring pastures is the key of the key. The pasture is only so big, there is only so much grass, and the number of sheep is constantly breeding and growing. Where can the summer and autumn pastures be expanded? This is the first problem Manxita focused on. However, "Thousands of difficulties, relying on the masses is not difficult." Manxita convened several meetings of small team leaders and shepherds, and through the masses offering suggestions, more than one hundred large and small pastures that had never been used before were proposed at once. After sending people to conduct on-site surveys, the area of ​​these pastures was fully equivalent to one-fifth of the area of ​​last year's summer and autumn pastures. However, these pastures are distributed relatively scattered, of different sizes, some in mountain gullies, some on mountain tops, and some on hillsides. In order to make full use of them and facilitate the frequent transfer and flexible use of sheep flocks, everyone proposed measures to reduce the size of sheep flocks, from the past four to five hundred per flock to about three hundred.
    While expanding the summer and autumn pastures, everyone further studied how to improve the utilization rate of the grassland. At this time, everyone further carefully studied Manxita's experience; this is: on the basis of seasonal rotational grazing, take measures of dividing blocks by month, dividing plots by week, and rotating grazing daily; in the morning, the sheep are relatively hungry, and they are willing to eat regardless of whether the grass is good or bad, so let the sheep eat the leftover grass from the previous day in the morning, and then eat new grass in the afternoon; when entering each new pasture, take a fan-shaped grazing method of gradually "gnawing" from the edge to the center. Through the above measures, not only can it prevent the pasture from being arbitrarily trampled and wasted, but it can also ensure that the sheep can often eat fresh grass. In this way, not only is this year's winter and spring pasture expanded by more than one-third compared to last year, but also the time to enter the summer pasture this year is one month earlier than last year, and the time to enter the winter pasture is postponed by one month, which powerfully guarantees the needs of the winter and spring pastures.
    Leading the Entire Team with Points and Surfaces
    Manxita, as the Deputy Director of the Commune and the Secretary of the Commune Youth League Committee, and also the captain of this high-yield sheep team, has always maintained the true colors of a working herdsman and works in the sheep flock year after year. Whenever he goes to a sheep flock, he always herds sheep with the shepherds, and if he finds a problem, he discusses and solves it with the shepherds, and then promotes the solution in other sheep flocks. He leads the entire team through this method of "leading the team with the flock, and leading the whole team with points and surfaces."
      "Eat more grass, gain more weight," after the summer and autumn pastures were expanded, he often pondered how to make the sheep eat more, eat well, and gain weight quickly. Therefore, every time he goes to a flock, he always carefully observes and carefully studies the ewes' grazing situation. Once, he came to a sheep flock and found that this sheep flock had a "heating up" situation in the morning ("heating up" means that the sheep are lying on the ground without eating grass in the midday sun). He wondered why this phenomenon occurred in the morning? He remembered an old herdsman's saying: "Sheep walk towards the sun, eat grass and bask their heads, eating slowly and lazily." He also found that in the same flock, a few ewes standing with their backs to the sun were eating very happily. After understanding, other sheep flocks also had similar situations. So, he and everyone studied and proposed "in the morning, block the sheep's heads facing west, at noon, block the sheep's heads facing north, and in the afternoon, block the sheep's heads facing east," which effectively solved the problem of this sheep flock not eating grass well. This year, many summer pastures are in high mountain areas that have not been grazed before, and the climate changes quickly; sometimes when the weather changes, the sheep do not eat grass well. In order to ensure that the ewes can eat grass comfortably in the event of variable weather, he and everyone studied and proposed measures to "release the sunny mountains when the weather is cool, release the gullies and rivers when it is cloudy and rainy, and release the high mountains on sunny days," which not only ensured that the ewes were full and well-fed, but also made full use of all the pastures.
    In addition, he also always pays attention to summarizing the effective experiences of the shepherds, giving timely praise, and promoting them throughout the team. Once, he went to Jiang Fawang's team to understand the weight gain of the ewes and found a group of ewes blocked on the hillside of a high mountain. Dense shrubs grew densely around this pasture, which was lush and not small in area, and it was difficult to see the channel through which the sheep flock entered. He thought, in the past, no one would block the sheep here. How did they drive the sheep inside? It turned out that there was a small road on the back of this mountain that led to this pasture. The shepherds used this small road to adopt the method of "grazing and driving, detouring and entering," so that the sheep ate good grass and made full use of this pasture. He thought that there were still many similar pastures. If each team could do this, wouldn't the area of ​​the summer and autumn pastures be even larger? After being promoted to each team, it was indeed welcomed by all the shepherds.
    Try Every Possible Means to Achieve Full Mating and Pregnancy
    The above series of measures have achieved the expected results. By August, these ten thousand ewes had completely eliminated the third-class fatness and all reached the first-class fatness. The ewes were fat and strong, and had many and strong estrus cycles; the number of sheep in estrus each day reached a maximum of nine hundred. This was a new situation that had never happened before.
    The production team decided to use Xinjiang sheep to artificially inseminate all ten thousand ewes for crossbreeding and improvement, but there were only twenty-five breeding rams in total, and the semen supply could not keep up. At this time, Manxita selected the best breeding personnel in the team, strengthened the supplementary feed for the breeding rams, and made full preparations for strictly collecting semen, storing semen, and identifying semen, so as to ensure that one estrus ewe was mated to one, and one estrus flock was mated to one. Also, due to the adoption of measures such as timed continuous insemination and re-checking and supplementing mating after mating, all ten thousand ewes finally reached full mating and pregnancy.
    ××× Now, the ewes that were mated early have begun to lamb. Manxita has once again put his leadership energy into preparing for the protection of the ewes, maintaining their weight, and receiving and raising the lambs. Under his leadership, the majority of shepherds have made full preparations for receiving and raising lambs: the ewes have pens, and the lambs have warm sheds. They all said with great enthusiasm: Having passed the full mating and full pregnancy stage, we are determined to win the full birth, full survival, and full growth stage.
    In this way, Manxita relied on the leadership of the Party and the wisdom of the majority of shepherds, grasped one key problem after another, and solved one contradiction after another, moving from victory to victory.

    满西塔和他的万羊万羔群
    本报记者　江河沅
    全国青年社会主义建设积极分子、青海省畜牧业战线上的标兵、著名的藏族放牧能手、共产党员满西塔，今年领导放牧的一万只母羊又达到全配满怀。目前这些母羊膘肥体壮，一个个鼓崩崩地垂下了肚子，有些已开始产羔。
    10月下旬，当我们冒着漫天大雪，赶到祁连山中满西塔羊群的秋季牧场时，他正把羊挡在一个很大的崖坡上。尽管大雪淹没了整个草原，羊只却仍然可以从崖坡的横断面上，用嘴掀掉积雪，津津有味地吃着牧草。今年，祁连山的雪下得特别早，10月就大雪封山了。但是，由于全体放牧员采取了这样的雪后放牧方法，坚持白天跟群，夜晚轮流守圈、查圈，严格执行各种保胎措施，到现在还没有一只母羊流产、掉膘。满西塔满怀信心地告诉我们说：全配、全怀、全生、全活、全壮，是保证羊只高速度繁殖的五个关键，有了全配、全怀的基础，争取全生、全活、全壮就不难了。
    大家争学先进经验
    满西塔是门源回族自治县苏吉滩公社第一生产队一个杰出的放牧员，现在又是公社党委会的委员、副社长和公社团委书记。以前，在青海草原上，每百只适龄母羊，一年能够繁殖成活六、七十只羊羔，就算是丰收的年景了。可是，他放牧的母羊，不管气候条件如何恶劣、多变，繁殖成活率总是超过100％（包括一部分母羊产双羔）。1958年，他放牧的七百只母羊，繁殖成活率达到110％；1959年，由他领导放牧的三千只母羊，繁殖成活率又超过了100％。有的放牧员用民歌赞扬满西塔说：“苏吉滩公社有个满西塔，牧羊的本领谁也比不上他：羊群好比他的连心肉，腿勤手巧一心爱社如家。”
    起初，有些人认为满西塔羊群的繁殖成活率高，是由于他“走运”。也有些人认为满西塔的羊好、草多，繁殖成活率当然高。今年春季产羔结束以后，当满西塔领导放牧的三千只母羊在同其他羊群一样的条件下，又创造了产羔成活三千一百只的大群丰产纪录的时候，就不得不使这些人口服心服了。
    满西塔这一新的成就，也启发了更多的放牧员，他们说：同样在党的领导下，满西塔能做的，自己为什么做不到？许多放牧员交流经验，研究措施，提出了响亮的“学、赶、超满西塔”的行动口号。“参加满西塔的队伍！”“让满西塔领导我们的丰产群！”成了广大放牧员的共同愿望。趁着羊羔离乳、调整羊群的时机，全队一共建立起三十三个绵羊高额丰产群，共有适龄母羊一万只。在大家的迫切要求下，生产队党支部决定把这些丰产群交由满西塔领导，并命名为共产主义青年丰产羊队。
    依靠群众智慧无穷
    满西塔经常对人说：“我没有什么，经验是大家创造的。我不过是根据党的指示，把大家的经验集中起来，然后再贯彻下去。”他就是这样处处依靠党的领导，依靠群众的智慧，胜利地执行着党交给他的任务。
    要使成万只母羊获得高额丰产，根本的关键在于如何使这些母羊达到膘肥体壮，全配满怀。“羊靠人放，膘靠草长”。满西塔经常这样想：夏、秋是母羊抓膘的大好时机，应该有大片的草场；冬、春是母羊产羔哺乳的季节，必须保证有足够的冬春草场。如何在保证留足冬、春草场的基础上，尽量扩大夏、秋草场，这又是关键中的关键。草场就是这么大，草就是那么多，羊只不断在繁殖增长，夏、秋草场往哪里去扩大呢？这是满西塔首先狠抓的一个问题。但是，“千难万难，依靠群众就不难”。满西塔几次召集小队长和放牧员开会，通过群众献计，一下就提出了一百多处过去从来没有利用过的大小草场。经过派人实地勘察，这些草场的面积，足足相当于去年夏、秋草场面积的五分之一。但是，这些草场分布得比较零散，大小不一，有的在山沟里，有的在山顶上，有的在半山腰，为了能够充分利用上，又便于羊群经常转移，灵活运用，大家又提出了划小羊群的措施，由过去的每群四、五百只，缩小到三百只左右。
    在扩大夏、秋草场的同时，大家又进一步研究了如何提高草原利用率的问题。这时，大家进一步认真学习了满西塔的经验；这就是：在四季轮牧的基础上，采取按月划块、按周划片、逐日轮牧的措施；上午，羊只比较饿，不管草好、草坏都愿意吃，因而在上午先让羊吃前一天吃剩的残草，到下午再吃新草；在进入每块新的草场时，采取由边缘到中心逐步“蚕食”的扇形放牧法。通过以上措施，不但可以防止牧草被任意践踏形成浪费，也可以保证羊只经常吃到鲜草。这样，既使今年的冬、春草场比去年扩大三分之一以上，也使今年进入夏季草场的时间比去年提前一个月，进入冬季草场的时间推迟一个月，有力地保证了冬、春草场的需要。
    以点带面领导全队
    满西塔身为公社副社长和公社团委书记，又是这个丰产羊队的队长，但他始终保持着劳动牧民的本色，长年累月地工作在羊群里。他每到一个羊群，总是同放牧员一起挡羊，发现问题就和放牧员共同商量解决，然后把解决的办法在其他羊群中推广。通过这种“以群带队，以点带面”的方法领导着全队。
      “多吃草、多长膘”，在夏、秋草场扩大以后，他又经常琢磨着如何才能使羊吃得多，吃得好，快长膘。因此，他每到一个群，总要仔细观察，认真研究母羊吃草的情况。有一次，他来到一个羊群，发现这个羊群在上午就有“打热群”的情况（“打热群”就是在中午烈日当空的时候，羊只因热卧在地上不吃草）。他奇怪，为什么在上午就有这种现象呢？他想起了老牧民的一句经验之谈：“羊朝日头走，吃草晒着头，吃得慢来懒得走。”他又发现，同样在一个群里，背着太阳站的几只母羊，就吃得很欢。经过了解，其他羊群也有类似的情况。于是，他和大家研究，提出了“上午挡羊头朝西，中午挡羊头朝北，下午挡羊头朝东”，果然有效地解决了这个羊群不好好吃草的问题。今年，不少夏季草场都在没有放牧过的高山地区，气候变化较快；有时天气一变，羊又不好好吃草了。为了在气候多变的情况下，保证母羊能够舒畅地吃草，他又和大家研究提出了“天气凉了放阳山，连阴下雨放沟川，晴天烈日放高山”的措施，既保证了母羊吃饱吃好，也充分利用了所有的草场。
    此外，他还随时注意总结放牧员中行之有效的经验，及时给予表扬，并在全队推广。有一次，他到蒋发旺小队去了解母羊增膘情况，发现有群母羊挡在一座高山的半山坡上，在这片牧草茂密、面积又不小的草坡的四周，密密麻麻地长着灌木，很难看出羊群进入的通道。他想，要是在过去，谁也不会把羊挡到这里。究竟怎样把羊赶到里面去的呢？原来在这座山的背面，有条小路可以通往这片草场。放牧员就是通过这条小道，采取“边放边赶、迂回而入”的办法，使羊只吃到了好草，充分利用了这片草场。他想，类似这样的草场还不少，如果各队都能这样做，夏、秋草场的面积，不是更可以扩大了吗？经过向各队推广，果然受到了全体放牧员的欢迎。
    千方百计全配满怀
    经过以上一系列的措施，收到了预期的效果。到8月间，这一万只母羊就彻底消灭三类膘，全部达到了一类膘。母羊膘肥体壮，发情又多又旺；每天发情的羊数，最高达到九百只。这是过去从来没有过的新情况。
    生产队决定这一万只母羊全部用新疆羊采取人工授精的办法，杂交改良，但种公羊一共只有二十五只，精液供应不上。这时，满西塔抽出全队最好的配种员，一面加强对种公羊的补充饲料，一面严格采精、储精以及鉴定精液等作好充分准备，这样就保证了发情一头配一头，发情一群配一群。还由于采取定时连续输精、配后复查补配等措施，终于使一万只母羊达到全配满怀。
    ×××现在，各群早配的母羊已经开始产羔。满西塔又把自己的领导精力放到了对母羊的保胎、保膘以及接羔育羔的准备上来。广大放牧员在他的领导下，已经作好了接羔、育羔的充分准备：母羊有了圈，羊羔有了暖棚。他们一个个干劲充沛地说：闯过了全配、全怀关，誓夺全生、全活、全壮关。
    满西塔就是这样，依靠了党的领导和广大放牧员的智慧，抓住了一个一个关键问题，解决了一个一个矛盾，从胜利走向胜利。
