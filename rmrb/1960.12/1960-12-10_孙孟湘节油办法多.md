Sun Mengxiang, a bus driver at the Xinxiang Station of the Yubei Transportation Company in Henan Province, has overfulfilled his transportation tasks for more than forty consecutive months since March 1957. He has saved the state more than 28,000 liters of gasoline, becoming a red banner for high output, safety, and low consumption.

Sun Mengxiang always pays attention to saving gasoline. He said, "A car without oil is like a person without blood. The country is building so fast, and gasoline is needed everywhere, so we should save it." When refueling the car, he always puts a pan underneath to catch the spilled oil. Before leaving the station every day, he conducts a detailed inspection of all parts of the car to prevent breakdowns on the road. He said, "One breakdown wastes several liters of gasoline." When arriving at the station in the evening, he cleans the machine again, paying special attention to important components such as the oil and electrical systems.

His experience in saving gasoline can be summarized as: meticulously maintaining the vehicle to ensure it is in good condition; operating it flexibly and efficiently; keeping the vehicle clean, especially ensuring the normal operation of important components; maintaining the temperature at 80 degrees Celsius while driving; filtering gasoline and engine oil before use; never opening the throttle wide in any situation; maintaining medium speed driving; and frequently lubricating moving parts to ensure flexible operation.

Sun Mengxiang is able to sincerely help others. In the past, driver Wang Jianchun emphasized output and neglected saving, and his fuel consumption often exceeded the prescribed standards. Sun Mengxiang often patiently helped him and disassembled his own oil-saving lubricator and distributor to install them on Wang Jianchun's car. This year, Wang Jianchun has also saved gasoline every month. He is also good at learning from the strengths of others. He said, "Other people's advanced experience is accumulated with hard work, and learning it well is fast, effective, and has great results." For example, driver Lan Fugui shifts gears quickly, drives steadily, and saves fuel, so he humbly learns from him and applies it to his own operation, thus continuously improving his operating skills.

### 孙孟湘节油办法多

    孙孟湘节油办法多
    河南省豫北运输公司新乡车站客车司机孙孟湘，从1957年3月以来，连续四十多个月超额完成运输任务，并为国家节约汽油两万八千公升以上，成为一面高产、安全、低消耗的红旗。
    孙孟湘时刻注意节约汽油。他说：“汽车没有油，就像人身上没有血。国家建设这么快，到处需要汽油，我们应该节约。”往车上加油时，下边总是放一个盘子，把漏下去的油接起来。每天出车前，他对汽车的各个部件都进行一次细致的检查，杜绝了中途抛锚。他说：“抛一次锚，几公升汽油就浪费掉了。”晚上到站，又对机器进行一次清扫，特别对油路、电路等重要机件更是细心。
    他节约汽油的经验概括起来是：精心保养好车辆，保证车辆完好；灵活机动操作；坚持车辆清洁，特别是保证重要机件运转正常；开车、行驶时保持温度在八十度；汽油、机油过滤后使用；在任何情况下都不大开油门；保持中速行车；运转部分勤加油，多加油，保证运转灵活。
    孙孟湘能诚恳帮助别人。司机王建春过去重视产量，忽视节约，耗油量经常超过规定标准；孙孟湘就经常耐心地帮助他，并把自己节油用的滑油器、分电机等拆下来，安在王建春的车上。今年以来，王建春也月月节约了汽油。他还善于学习别人的长处。他说：“别人的先进经验，是用心血积累起来的，学习得好，收效快，效果大。”例如司机蓝富贵换挡快，车速稳，节约油，他就虚心学习，运用到自己的操作中去，因此他的操作技术能不断地提高。
