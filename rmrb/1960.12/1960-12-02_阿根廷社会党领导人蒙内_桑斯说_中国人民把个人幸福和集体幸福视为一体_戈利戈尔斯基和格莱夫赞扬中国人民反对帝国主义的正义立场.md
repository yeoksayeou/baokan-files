Xinhua News Agency, December 28th: Buenos Aires news: A group of Argentine students and journalists who visited China in June held a symposium on China at the Faculty of Exact Sciences of the University of Buenos Aires recently. Monne Sans, a leader of the Socialist Party, spoke about his impressions of his visit to China, saying that China had already overfulfilled the main targets of the production plan that was originally scheduled to be completed in 1962 in 1959. He said that this was because every Chinese person regarded their individual happiness as one with the happiness of all the people, thus generating an incredible force. He said that nothing could resist this surging force of the Chinese people, and the current U.S. government and the future Kennedy government should consider this issue.

Eduardo Golyhorsky, who belongs to the opposition faction of the Intransigent Radical Civic Union, praised China's emphasis on national traditions and art. He said that the impression given by foreign bourgeois newspapers when talking about China is that China is only devoted to economic construction, but China has not only preserved but is also paying attention to studying and developing its artistic treasures. He pointed out that the ancient Chinese palaces, gardens, and temples, which were originally only for certain foreign tourists and wealthy locals to visit, have now become the property of the people of the whole country. After talking about the destruction of the Chinese people's artistic heritage by imperialism, Golyhorsky said that the Chinese people "are not as warlike as some people say. The Chinese people are only against imperialism because they know that imperialism is the great enemy of the freedom, development, and peace of all peoples."

Edith Graf of the Argentine-Chinese Cultural Association spoke about the happy lives of Chinese women after liberation. She said that Chinese women "have achieved their independent status and are now engaged in the construction of their country with great enthusiasm." She emphasized that China hopes to get along well with all countries in the world and is particularly concerned about the struggles of Latin America, Algeria, Japan, and all peoples suffering from imperialist oppression.

    中国人民把个人幸福和集体幸福视为一体
    戈利戈尔斯基和格莱夫赞扬中国人民反对帝国主义的正义立场
    新华社28日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：在今年6月间访问过中国的阿根廷一批学生和记者最近在布宜诺斯艾利斯大学精密科学院举行了一次关于中国的座谈会：社会党领导人蒙内·桑斯谈到他访问中国的观感时说，中国在1959年就已经超额完成了原定要在1962年完成的生产计划的主要指标，他说，这是由于每个中国人都把他们个人的幸福同全体人民的幸福视为一体，因而产生了难以置信的力量。他说，没有什么东西能够抗拒中国人民这支汹涌澎湃的力量，目前的美国政府和未来的肯尼迪政府都应该考虑到这个问题。
    属于不妥协激进公民联盟反对派的爱德华多·戈利戈尔斯基赞扬了中国对民族传统和艺术的重视。他说，外国资产阶级的报纸谈到中国时给人的印象是中国只致力于经济建设，但是中国不仅保存了并且正在注意研究和发展它的艺术宝藏。他指出，原来只供某些外国旅行者和本国的富豪游览的中国古代的宫殿，花园和庙宇，现在已经成为全国人民的财产。戈利戈尔斯基在谈到中国人民的艺术遗产遭到帝国主义的破坏以后说，中国人民“并不像有些人所说的那样是好战的。中国人民仅仅是反对帝国主义，因为他们知道，帝国主义是各国人民的自由、发展与和平的大敌。”
    阿中文化协会的伊迪思·格莱夫谈到了解放后中国妇女的幸福生活。她说，中国妇女“已经取得了她们的独立地位，现在正以极大的热情从事他们国家的建设。”她强调指出，中国希望和世界各国友好相处，并且特别关心拉丁美洲、阿尔及利亚、日本和所有遭受帝国主义压迫的人民的斗争。
