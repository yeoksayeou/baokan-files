Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 24th—Korean Central News Agency recently published a report on the brilliant achievements of the Korean people this year in implementing the main tasks of the buffer period (1960).

The report stated that the people of North Korea have victoriously completed the tasks of the buffer period and are preparing to welcome the new battle of implementing the magnificent Seven-Year Plan (1961-1967).

This year, the Korean people have overfulfilled the tasks of the First Five-Year Plan (1957-1961) in all sectors of the people's economy and in all projects. The total industrial output value is expected to be 30% higher than the level stipulated in the Five-Year Plan for 1961 and 16% higher than the actual output value of last year. Hundreds of factories, enterprises, and workshops have completed their production tasks for this year ahead of schedule.

Agricultural production achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year. This year, the average grain output per capita reached 380 kilograms, an increase of 30% compared to 1956, which is equivalent to three times the grain output of South Korea last year and more than twice that of Japan.

The central task of the buffer period proposed by the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea at its expanded plenary meeting last December was to alleviate the tensions caused in some sectors of the people's economy in the past, especially in the implementation of the 1959 plan for national economic construction, to strengthen weak links, and to further improve people's lives. In order to complete this task, the Korean working people displayed revolutionary vigor and creativity, concentrated their efforts on improving the level of agricultural mechanization, carried out comprehensive technical innovations, improved labor productivity and equipment utilization, and strived to increase production and practice economy. This year, the work of agricultural mechanization has made great progress in the nationwide agricultural mechanization movement. In the first three quarters of the year, the state supplied more than 2,000 tractors to agriculture, bringing the total number of tractors in the country to 10,500 (calculated in terms of 15 horsepower). The area cultivated by machinery in the first eleven months of this year reached more than 5.4 million chongbo (one chongbo equals fifteen Chinese mu), which is equivalent to eleven times that of 1956 and nearly twice that of last year.

The report stated that the increase in worker labor productivity and equipment utilization rate is the main factor for the 16% increase in industrial production compared to last year. According to preliminary statistics, the output value produced by each worker this year is expected to reach 2.2 times that of 1949. By the end of November this year, steel production had increased by 170,000 tons compared to the same period last year, of which 100,000 tons were obtained by improving equipment utilization. The working efficiency of lathes in the third quarter increased by 80% compared to the same period last year.

On the basis of the continued high growth of the people's economy, people's lives have been further improved this year. This year, the output of grain and non-staple foods has increased significantly, the output of consumer goods has also increased, and a large number of houses and cultural facilities have been built.

The report stated that the actual wages of employees this year reached more than twice that of 1949. The income distributed to members of agricultural cooperatives in various places has also greatly exceeded that of last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 23rd—According to local newspapers, after three years of hard work by the broad masses of workers, industrial production in North Vietnam has completed and overfulfilled the Three-Year Plan (1958-1960) and the annual plan for 1960 ahead of schedule.

The heavy industry sector has completed the three-year production plan and the 1960 national production plan ahead of schedule between November 15th and December 15th. According to statistics, the total output value of heavy industry in 1960 increased by 210.3% compared to 1957, an average annual increase of 45.9%. The electricity produced in 1960 was equal to 235.9% of 1957, coal – 219.5%, ore – 499.2%, building materials – 275.4%, chemical industrial products – 616.1%, and machinery manufacturing products – 1504%.

Over the past three years, labor productivity has increased by an average of 16.5% per year. Product costs are also 1.05%-3.27% lower than the original plan. Due to the great development of production and the reduction of costs, the accumulation of the heavy industry sector in 1960 increased by two times compared to 1957.

Over the past three years, the state's investment in basic construction of heavy industry has increased by 458.3 million yuan compared to the previous three years. There are 100 projects above the quota newly built and expanded by the Ministry of Heavy Industry, including the large-scale Thai Nguyen Iron and Steel Base and the Lam Thao Phosphate Fertilizer Plant.

In 1957, there were only 22 heavy industrial enterprises put into production in the entire North, but now it has developed to 53. New products produced include various machine tools, agricultural machinery, internal combustion engines, and compressors.

The light industry sector also completed the three-year plan ten days ahead of schedule on December 20th. The total output value reached 103.2% of the national plan. Textiles, equipment, wood, matches, paper, food, and other sectors completed 100.2%-127.9%. The main products have grown rapidly, with an average annual increase of 35.8% in cloth, 31.4% in silk, and 39.2% in matches.

The patriotic production competition movement has also been carried out extensively and deeply in various industrial sectors. In the past three years, workers have put forward tens of thousands of innovation proposals, saving the state millions of yuan in funds. In the first half of this year alone, there were 10,348 advanced workers in the heavy industry sector, and various production units have received 67 Labor Medals and 133 certificates awarded by the government. Six enterprises in the light industry sector have also won competition prize banners. (Picture attached)

The Hanoi Machine Factory has completed the three-year plan ahead of schedule. This is the factory's "August" team helping brother teams manufacture machine tool parts. They have overfulfilled the production plan by 25%.

    朝鲜全面超额完成五年计划
    今年工业产值将比去年增长16％农业生产获得空前丰收
    越南提前超额完成工业生产三年计划
    新华社平壤24日电　朝鲜中央通讯社最近发表了关于朝鲜人民今年在执行缓冲期（1960年）主要任务中所取得的辉煌成就的报道。
    报道说，朝鲜北部人民已经胜利地完成了缓冲期的任务，正在有准备地迎接执行宏伟的七年计划（1961—1967年）的新战斗。
    今年，朝鲜人民在各个人民经济部门和所有项目上都超额完成了第一个五年计划（1957—1961年）的任务。工业总产值预计将比五年计划为1961年规定的水平高出30％，比去年的实际产值增加16％。成百上千的工厂、企业、车间已经提前完成了今年的生产任务。
    农业生产今年获得了空前丰收。今年按人口平均计算的粮食产量达到三百八十公斤，比1956年增加了30％，这相当于去年南朝鲜粮食产量的三倍，日本的二倍多。
    朝鲜劳动党中央委员会去年12月扩大全体会议上提出的缓冲期中心任务是：缓和一部分人民经济部门中在过去特别是在执行1959年人民经济建设计划中所造成的紧张情况，加强薄弱环节，进一步提高人民生活。朝鲜劳动人民为了完成这一任务，发挥革命干劲和创造性，集中力量提高农业机械化的水平，进行全面的技术革新，提高劳动生产率和设备利用率，努力增产节约。今年农业机械化的工作在全民性的农业机械化运动中获得了巨大进展。国家在头三个季度中，向农业供应了二千多台拖拉机，使全国拖拉机总数达到一万零五百台（按十五马力计算）。今年头十一个月的机耕面积达到五百四十多万町步（一町步合十五市亩），相当于1956年的十一倍，将近去年的两倍。
    报道说，工人劳动生产率和设备利用率的提高，是工业生产能比去年增长16％的主要因素。据初步统计，今年每个工人生产的产值预计将达到1949年的二点二倍。到今年11月底为止，钢产量比去年同期增加了十七万吨，其中有十万吨就是由提高设备利用率取得的。车床工作效率在第三季度比去年同期提高了80％。
    在人民经济继续高涨的基础上，在这一年中人民生活得到进一步的改善。今年粮食和副食品的产量有了显著的增加，消费品产量也有增长，大量地建造了住宅和文化设施。
    报道说，今年职工实际工资达到了1949年的二倍以上。各地农业社社员所分配到的收入也大大超过了去年。
    新华社河内23日电　据此间报纸报道，经过广大职工三年来的艰苦奋斗，越南北方工业生产已经提前超额完成三年计划（1958—1960年）和1960年的年度计划。
    重工业部门已经在11月15日到12月15日先后提前完成了三年生产计划和1960年国家生产计划。据统计，1960年的重工业总产值比1957年增长了210.3％，平均每年增长45.9％。1960年生产的电力等于1957年的235.9％，煤—219.5％，矿石——499.2％，建筑器材——275．4％，化学工业产品——616.1％，机械制造业产品——1504％。
    三年来，劳动生产率平均每年增长16.5％。产品成本也比原定计划低1.05％—3.27％。由于大大地发展了生产和降低了成本，重工业部门1960年的积累比1957年增长了二倍。
    三年来，国家对重工业的基本建设投资额比前三年增加了四亿五千八百三十万元，重工业部新建和扩建的限额以上的工程就有一百项，其中包括规模巨大的太原钢铁基地、林涛磷肥厂等。
    1957年全北方投入生产的重工业企业只有二十二个，但目前已经发展到五十三个。生产出的新产品包括各种机床、农业机器、内燃机和压缩机等。
    轻工业部门在12月20日也提前十天完成了三年计划。总产值达到国家计划的103.2％。纺织、器材、木材、火柴、用纸、食品等部门完成100.2％—127.9％。主要产品迅速增长，布类逐年平均增长35.8％，绸增长31.4％，火柴增长39.2％。
    爱国生产竞赛运动也在各工业部门深入广泛开展。在过去三年中，工人们提出了上万项革新建议，为国家节约了上百万元的资金。单是今年上半年重工业部门就有一万零三百四十八名先进劳动者，各生产单位已经获得了政府授予的六十七枚劳动勋章和一百三十三个奖状。轻工业部门也有六个企业获得了竞赛奖旗。（附图片）
    河内机器厂已经提前完成三年计划。这是该厂的“八月”小组在帮助兄弟小组制造机床的零件，他们已经超额25％完成了生产计划。
