    Mountain Village Gardener
    --On the Deeds of Young Teacher Fang Dewei, Who Worked Hard to Run a Mountain Village Elementary School
    Sang Zi
    Young teacher Fang Dewei created outstanding teaching achievements at a newly established four-grade combined single-class mountain village elementary school – Ban Jianwu Elementary School.
    Ban Jianwu Elementary School is an elementary school run by the Lvjing Production Team of the Fuling Commune in Jixi County, Anhui Province. The Lvjing Production Team has a total of twenty-six households, scattered in the mountains over an area of more than thirty li. Most are one household per village, and the nearest distance from one village to another is three or four li, and all require crossing mountains and rivers. The people living in the deep mountains and dense forests, after liberation, experienced a turnaround in politics and economics and are eager for their children to receive a school education. However, there were no schools in the mountains. Some team members who had relatives down the mountain would have their children stay with relatives to attend school, while most team members' children never had the opportunity to go to school. In 1958, under the leadership of the production team's Party organization, an elementary school was established in Ban Jianwu, the central location of the entire team. The school was established, but who would be the teacher? Shao Guanfu, the secretary of the production team's Party branch, ran around looking for a teacher, and finally found Fang Dewei. Fang Dewei thought to himself, he had only studied for five years, how could he be a teacher? However, from Secretary Shao's conversation, the mountain children's desire for culture deeply moved him, reminding him of his painful experience of dropping out of school as a child. He thought, he was a Communist Youth League member, and difficulties could be overcome! Fang Dewei finally agreed to Secretary Shao's request, and the next day, carrying his bedding, he crossed mountains and ridges and came to Ban Jianwu.
    In the first semester, there were a total of seventeen students in the school, most of whom were just starting school, and some were transferred from schools down the mountain. Based on the students' cultural level, Fang Dewei formed a four-grade combined large single class from the first to fourth grades of junior elementary school. In the beginning, because the teacher lacked teaching experience, especially the teaching experience of combined single classes, classroom discipline was not good. When the teacher was lecturing to one grade, the other three grades of students would make small movements and talk quietly. As a result, both teachers and students felt strained after a class, and the teaching effect was not good.
    Fang Dewei thought to himself, the teacher must teach well, and the students must also learn well. He called the students to his side and sincerely told them that his cultural level was not high, and that he would learn and teach at the same time in the future, and try his best to teach the lessons well. In the conversation, he also asked the students to observe discipline and concentrate on listening to the lectures. The teacher's words deeply moved the children, and from then on, classroom discipline began to improve. With the students listening, Fang Dewei concentrated on doing a good job in teaching. The newly established mountain elementary school had a poor foundation and lacked teaching reference books, so Fang Dewei repeatedly read the texts, grasped the main spirit of the texts, and wrote down the places that needed to be emphasized in the lesson preparation notes. He calculated all the arithmetic exercises for the third and fourth grades himself before class. When encountering difficult problems in lesson preparation, he was not vague at all. If he could not solve them himself, he would use Sundays to cross mountains and rivers to Xiaoyao Elementary School, ten li away, to consult experienced teachers there. Fang Dewei prepared lessons while teaching and learning. In less than two months, he prepared all the language and arithmetic courses for the four grades. Fang Dewei attached importance to lesson preparation and also attached importance to improving teaching methods. Hearing other teachers say that using teaching aids for intuitive teaching made it easier for students to accept, he cut some mao bamboo from the mountain and asked for some thick cardboard from the supply and marketing point, and made more than twenty kinds of teaching aids such as calculators and counting sticks himself. Because he had made full preparations before class and there were great improvements in teaching methods, the students were also able to concentrate their attention on learning, so the teaching effect was greatly strengthened and the teaching quality was also significantly improved.
    However, in such a mountain valley as Ban Jianwu, to run a school well, in addition to overcoming various difficulties in teaching, it is also necessary to overcome many difficulties brought about by natural conditions. In Ban Jianwu, there are mountains when you go out and ridges when you take a step. The mountain roads are rugged and difficult to walk, especially during the plum rain season, when mountain torrents break out, or during the cold winter months when ice and snow block the roads. For the safety of the children, parents always keep their children at home and do not let them go to school, which greatly affects teaching work. Fang Dewei was determined to break through this obstacle. In addition to regularly conducting safety education for students, he also flexibly arranged teaching time according to the laws of mountain climate change, allowing children to go home earlier on rainy and snowy days, and tried to protect the safety of students on the road. As a result, the attendance rate greatly increased. In order to enhance the students' physique and cultivate their love for the countryside and agricultural labor from an early age, Fang Dewei also often led the children to participate in some physical labor suitable for their age characteristics.
    In the past two years, Fang Dewei has worked hard and finally enabled this newly established elementary school to grow rapidly. From 1958 to now, under the diligent education of the teacher, the students have developed comprehensively in terms of morality, intelligence, and physical education. Shao Zhishu, Shao Shanda and other five students who transferred from this school to the senior elementary class of Xiaoyao Elementary School are now all "three-good" students.

    山村园丁
    ——记青年教师方德维艰苦奋斗办好山区小学的事迹
    桑子
    青年教师方德维，在一所新办的四复式单班山村小学——班肩坞小学里，创造了出色的教学成绩。
    班肩坞小学是安徽绩溪县伏岭公社绿景生产队办的一个小学。绿景生产队共有二十六户人家，散居在方圆三十多里的山丛中，多数是一户人家就算一个村，从这个村到那个村最近也有三、四里路，而且都要翻山涉水。住在深山密林里的人们，解放后，政治上、经济上都翻了身，迫切希望自己的孩子能受到学校教育。但是，山里没有学校，有几家山下有亲戚的社员，就把孩子寄居在亲戚家里上学，而大多数社员的孩子，一直得不到求学的机会。1958年，在生产队党组织的领导下，在全队的中心地点班肩坞办起了一座小学。学校办起来了，可是，谁来当这个学校的教师呢？生产队的党支部书记邵观甫同志东奔西走到处去找教师，结果找到了方德维。方德维心想，自己只念过五年书，怎能当教师呢？但是，从邵书记的谈话里，山里儿童渴求文化的心情深深地激动了他，使他想起自己幼年失学时的痛苦心情。他想，自己是个共青团员，有困难可以克服嘛！方德维终于答应了邵书记的要求，第二天就挑着铺盖，翻山过岭来到了班肩坞。
    第一学期，全校一共是十七个学生，其中，大部分是才上学的，一部分是从山下学校转来的。方德维根据这些学生的文化程度，编成了一个从初小一年级到四年级的四复式大单班。开始，因为教师缺乏教学经验，尤其是缺乏复式单班的教学经验，所以课堂纪律不大好。当老师在给其中一个年级讲课的时候，其余三个年级的学生就做小动作，唧唧嚓嚓地讲话。这样，一堂课下来，教师学生都感到吃力，教学效果还不好。
    方德维心想，教师要教得好，还要学生学得好。他把学生们叫到身边，诚恳地告诉他们，自己文化程度不高，今后要边学边教，想尽方法把课教好。在谈话中，他还要求学生遵守纪律，专心听课。老师的话，深深打动了孩子们的心，从此，课堂纪律开始有了好转。学生听话了，方德维就集中精力来搞好教学工作。新办的山区小学，基础差，没有什么教学参考书籍，方德维就反复阅读课文，掌握住课文的主要精神，需要着重讲解的地方，都写在备课笔记上。三、四年级的算术习题，他自己在课前都先演算一遍。备课中，遇有疑难问题，他毫不含糊，自己解决不了的，就利用星期天翻山涉水去到十里路外的逍遥小学，请教那里有经验的教师。方德维边教边学，边备课，不到两个月，就备好了四个年级的语文、算术全部课程。方德维重视备课，也重视改进教学方法。听别的教师说，讲课用教具进行直观教学，学生容易接受，他就从山上砍了些毛竹，从供销点要了些厚纸板，自己动手做了计算器、数数棒等二十多种教具。由于课前作了充分准备，教学方法上又有了很大改进，学生们也能聚精会神地把注意力集中到学习上来了，因此，教学效果大大加强，教学质量也有了显著的提高。
    但是，在班肩坞这样一个山坳里，要把一座学校办好，除了克服教学上的种种困难外，还需要克服自然条件带来的许多困难。班肩坞这个地方，出门是山，起步是岭，山路崎岖难行，尤其是逢到梅雨季节，山洪暴发的时候，或是数九寒天，冰雪封路的时候，为了孩子们的安全，家长们总是把孩子留在家里，不让去上学，这对教学工作很有影响。方德维决心突破这一障碍，他除了经常向学生进行安全教育外，还根据山区气候变化的规律，灵活地安排了教学时间，让孩子们在雨雪天能早一点回家，并且设法保护学生路上的安全。结果，到课率大大提高。为了增强学生的体质，从小就培养学生热爱乡村，热爱农业劳动的思想，方德维还经常带领孩子们参加一些适合他们年龄特征的体力劳动。
    两年来，方德维艰苦奋斗，终于使这所新办小学迅速成长起来。从1958年到现在，学生们在教师的辛勤教育下，德智体育有了全面的发展，从这个学校转到逍遥小学高小班学习的邵之树、邵善达等五个学生，现在都是“三好”学生。
