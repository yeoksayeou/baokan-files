    Soviet Clock Production Automation Level Ranks First in the World
    In terms of the automation level of clock production, the Soviet Union now ranks first in the world. In order to achieve a high degree of automation in clock production, Soviet engineers have invented and manufactured instruments and machines that are currently unparalleled in technology worldwide, used to produce the main, most complex, and labor-intensive parts of clocks. In the Soviet clock industry, the work of processing clock cases has been fully automated for the first time, increasing the labor productivity of this work by eight times.
    The Soviet clock industry only started to be established twenty-five years ago. Now its clock production accounts for the third largest share in the world, among which the production of watches is only second to Switzerland, which has more than three hundred years of experience in this field.

    苏钟表生产自动化水平居世界首位
    在钟表生产的自动化水平方面，苏联现在居世界第一。为了使钟表生产高度自动化，苏联工程师发明和制造了目前全世界技术中还没有过的仪器和机器，用来生产钟表中主要的、最复杂的和费劳动的部件。在苏联钟表工业中，已经头一次使加工钟表外壳的工作全部自动化，使这一工作的劳动生产率提高了八倍。
    苏联钟表工业只是在二十五年前才开始建立的。现在它的钟表产量已占世界第三位，其中手表的产量，已经仅次于在这方面具有三百多年经验的瑞士了。
