Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 8th: The United Nations General Assembly's discussion on the Soviet-proposed declaration on granting independence to colonial countries and peoples entered its tenth day yesterday. Since the debate began on November 28, representatives from more than sixty countries have spoken at the meeting. The crimes of old and new colonialist countries such as the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands in enslaving and plundering colonial people and suppressing national liberation movements have been severely condemned by representatives of socialist countries and many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

When Soviet representative Zorin spoke at the meeting on the 7th, he reminded the delegations to pay attention to the fact that so-called "classical" colonialism is no longer the main form of oppression. Today, the most powerful colonialist country is no longer the weakened Britain or France, nor the senile Portugal and the declining Spain, but the largest imperialist country—the United States. He said that American colonialism is in many ways similar to the old European colonialist countries, but it has a more sinister and ruthless side. The history of American imperialism is also full of wars and armed conquests aimed at plundering other countries' territories and oppressing other countries' people.

Zorin mocked the hypocritical speeches made by the US representative at the UN General Assembly. He emphasized that Wadsworth did not mention when the United States would grant independence to its colonies—the trust territories in the Pacific, Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Samoan Islands, and Puerto Rico.

Zorin said that American-style colonialism not only takes the form of open rule and occupation of other countries' territories, but also takes the form of disguised, and therefore more dangerous, jurisdiction and control over those ostensibly independent regions and countries. The United States is unwilling to allow the colonial people to gain complete and genuine independence, because in this case, American monopoly capital groups would lose their privileges in these colonies and lose their source of wealth. Zorin emphasized that American imperialism has become the largest international exploiter and the main pillar of modern colonialism.

Zorin analyzed the situation in the Congo. He said that the Congo incident dispelled the naive illusions of some sections of the people in the colonial countries, and not only in the colonial countries, about the promises made by the colonialists on various occasions, including at the United Nations rostrum. He pointed out that seeking compromise with the colonialists on the issue of eliminating colonialism, which is vital to the lives of billions of people, can only bring losses to the liberation struggle and benefit foreign oppressors. Any concession will prolong the suffering of the colonial people. The disasters now suffered by the Congolese people illustrate this.

The head of the Soviet delegation emphasized that the colonial system of enslavement is bound to collapse completely under the fierce impact of the national liberation movement. He said, we frankly warn the representatives of the colonialist countries: you had better understand the historical necessity and inevitability of eliminating the colonial system, and leave the colonies yourselves as soon as possible, otherwise the colonial people will drive you out of there. Zorin said that if the colonialists refuse to grant independence to the colonial countries and peoples, the oppressed people will have to take up arms to drive these uninvited enslavers out of their homeland. In this case, the obligation of all peace-loving countries is to fully support the just national liberation war of the colonial people.

US representative Wadsworth spoke at the meeting on the 6th, trying his best to cover up the hideous face of American colonialist robbers. On the one hand, he hypocritically stated that the United States supported the "rapid development of the independence movement," but at the same time, he advocated that the colonial people should conduct "consultations" with the authorities of the "administering countries" (i.e., the colonialist countries) to "stipulate the date of independence." Wadsworth even openly and bluntly opposed the immediate elimination of the evil colonial system. In the tone of a colonialist, he openly clamored that many nations "are not ready to accept (independence)" and cannot "transform a nation from colonial dependence to... independent status overnight." He also advocated holding so-called "free elections" controlled by the colonial authorities in the colonies, and supporting imperialist puppets, in order to achieve a "peaceful and harmonious transition" in the colonies, which is just a change of soup but not of medicine.

In his speech, Wadsworth also tried his best to whitewash the United Nations, boasting about the role of the United Nations in "helping to establish new countries" and providing "assistance" to these countries, while taking the opportunity to peddle US President Eisenhower's neocolonialist plan to "aid" Africa through the United Nations.

In order to divert the attention of the meeting, Wadsworth harped on the anti-communist and anti-Soviet tunes, frantically slandering the Soviet Union as "the largest colonial empire in the world," clamoring that we must not forget the people "suffering under the new colonialist system" in the Soviet Union. With deep-seated hatred for socialist countries, Wadsworth openly cursed that the socialist system "will surely perish."

Cuban representative Roa spoke after Wadsworth's speech. Roa listed many historical facts to expose the crimes of the United States in carrying out imperialist expansion in the Western Hemisphere and enslaving and plundering the people of this region. Roa pointed out that the imperialist forces headed by the United States are pursuing a new form of colonialism. He said that the United States still occupies Puerto Rico, the Panama Canal Zone, and the Swan Islands in the Caribbean, turning them into American colonies. Roa pointed out that the United States is still illegally occupying Guantanamo in Cuba. He said that the Cuban people have never agreed to the establishment of a base by the United States in Guantanamo, and the so-called "lease right" of the United States is legally invalid. Roa strongly condemned the crime of the imperialists and colonialists in instigating the Mobutu gang to kidnap Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba of the legitimate government. He demanded that the United Nations immediately take resolute steps to release Lumumba.

Belgian representative Paris spoke at the meeting on the evening of the 6th. He shamelessly denied Belgium's crime of invading the Congo. The representative of this old colonialist country also followed the United States in slandering the Soviet Union as a "colonialist" country, saying nonsense that "condemning colonialism... cannot but include the Soviet Union." When Paris spoke, representatives from more than forty countries left the venue, the conference hall was half empty, and the press seats were almost empty.

### 苏联代表谴责美国是殖民主义主要支柱

    联大全会讨论给殖民地国家和人民独立的宣言
    苏联代表谴责美国是殖民主义主要支柱
    佐林指出：殖民主义奴役制度必然彻底崩溃。如果殖民主义者拒绝给殖民地独立，被压迫人民将拿起武器赶走殖民奴役者。一切爱好和平的国家的义务是全力支持殖民地民族解放战争。
    新华社8日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会全体会议关于苏联提出的立即给予殖民地国家和人民独立的宣言的讨论，昨天进入第十天。自11月28日辩论开始以来，六十多个国家的代表在会上发了言。美国、英国、法国、比利时、荷兰等新老殖民主义国家奴役、掠夺殖民地人民，镇压民族解放运动的罪行在会上受到社会主义国家和亚、非、拉丁美洲许多国家代表严正的谴责。
    苏联代表佐林在7日会议上发言时提醒各国代表团注意，所谓“古典”殖民主义已经不是目前压迫的主要形式了。如今最强大的殖民主义国家，已经不是衰弱的英国或者法国，也不是老朽的葡萄牙和没落的西班牙，而是最大的帝国主义国家——美国。他说，美国殖民主义在很多方面很像老牌的欧洲殖民主义国家，但是它具有更阴险毒辣的一面。美国帝国主义的历史同样充满着旨在掠夺他国领土，压迫他国人民的战争和武装征伐。
    佐林嘲笑美国代表在联大会议上所作的假仁假义的发言，他着重指出，华兹沃斯一字不提美国什么时候给予它的殖民地——在太平洋的托管领土、关岛、维尔京群岛、萨摩亚群岛、波多黎各以独立。
    佐林说，美国式的殖民主义不仅采取公开统治和侵占别国领土的形式，而且也采取伪装的，因而也是更危险的管辖和控制那些表面上独立的地区和国家的形式。美国丝毫不愿意使殖民地人民得到完全的和真正的独立，因为在这种情况下，美国垄断资本集团就会失去它们在这些殖民地的特权，失去发财的源泉。佐林强调指出，美帝国主义成了最大的国际剥削者，现代殖民主义的主要支柱。
    佐林分析了刚果的局势。他说，刚果事件打消了殖民地国家，而且不仅是殖民地国家的某些阶层的人民对殖民主义者在各种场合，其中包括在联合国讲坛上许下的诺言的天真的幻想。他指出，在对亿万人民生命攸关的消灭殖民主义的问题上，同殖民主义者寻求妥协，只能给解放斗争带来损失，而有利于外国压迫者，任何让步都会延续殖民地人民的痛苦。刚果人民现在遭到的灾难就说明了这一点。
    苏联代表团团长强调指出，殖民主义奴役制度，在民族解放运动猛烈冲击下必然彻底崩溃。他说，我们坦率地正告殖民主义国家的代表：你们最好了解消灭殖民主义制度的历史必要性和不可避免性，趁早自己离开殖民地，不然殖民地人民就要把你们从那里赶出去。佐林说，如果殖民主义者拒绝给予殖民地国家和人民以独立，被压迫的人民就不得不拿起武器把这些不请自来的奴役者赶出他们的国土。在这种情况下，一切爱好和平的国家的义务就是要全力支持殖民地人民正义的民族解放战争。
    美国代表华兹沃斯在6日会议上发言，竭力掩盖美国殖民主义强盗的狰狞面目。他一方面假惺惺地表示，美国支持“独立运动的迅速发展”，同时却又鼓吹要殖民地人民同“负责管理的国家”（即殖民主义国家）当局进行“磋商”以“规定独立的日期”。华兹沃斯甚至公然露骨地反对立即消灭罪恶的殖民制度。他以殖民主义者的口吻公然叫嚷说许多民族“还没有作好接受（独立）的准备”，不能“一夜之间把一个民族从殖民地附属地位转变到……独立的地位”。他还主张在殖民地举行由殖民当局控制的所谓“自由选举”，扶植帝国主义的傀儡，以便在殖民地实现换汤不换药的“和平和和谐的转变”。
    华兹沃斯在发言中还极力为联合国涂脂抹粉，吹嘘联合国在“帮助建立新国家”和对这些国家提供“援助”方面的作用，同时趁机贩卖美国总统艾森豪威尔通过联合国“援助”非洲的新殖民主义计划。
    为了转移会议的注意力，华兹沃斯大弹反共反苏的滥调，疯狂诬蔑苏联是“世界上最大的一个殖民帝国”，叫嚷什么不能忘记在苏联“新殖民主义体系下受难的人”。华兹沃斯怀着对社会主义国家刻骨的仇恨公开咒骂社会主义制度“必将灭亡”。
    古巴代表罗亚在华兹沃斯讲话后发言。罗亚列举了许多历史事实揭露美国在西半球进行帝国主义扩张，奴役和掠夺这个地区人民的罪行。罗亚指出，以美国为首的帝国主义势力正在推行一种新形式的殖民主义政策。他说，美国目前仍然占领着波多黎各、巴拿马运河区、和加勒比海上的天鹅群岛，把它们变成美国的殖民地。罗亚指出，美国仍然非法霸占着古巴的关塔那摩。他说，古巴人民从来没有同意美国在关塔那摩建立基地，美国的所谓“租借权”在法律上是无效的。罗亚强烈地谴责帝国主义者和殖民主义者指使蒙博托匪帮绑架刚果合法政府总理卢蒙巴的罪行。他要求联合国立即采取坚决的步骤以释放卢蒙巴。
    比利时代表帕里斯6日晚在会上发言。他厚颜无耻地抵赖比利时侵略刚果的罪行。这个老牌殖民主义国家的代表也追随美国诬蔑苏联是“殖民主义”国家，胡说什么“谴责殖民主义……不能不把苏联包括在内”。帕里斯发言时，四十多个国家的代表离开了会场，会议大厅空了一半，记者席也几乎是空的。
