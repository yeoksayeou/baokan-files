Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Head of State of Cambodia, at the invitation of Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Premier Zhou Enlai of our country, is visiting our country for the third time, bringing with him the profound friendship of the Cambodian people. This is a great happy event in Sino-Cambodian relations, and it will surely promote the development of friendly cooperation between the two countries. Today, as the friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian people is becoming increasingly consolidated and developed, it is of great significance for us to look back on the long history of friendly coexistence between the ancestors of the two countries.

To the Chinese people, Cambodia, a country with a long history and culture located in the southern part of the Indochina Peninsula, is a close brotherly neighbor. Cambodia was called 《Funan》、《扶南》or《究 (ancient pronunciation, read Gan) 不事》in our country's earliest documents. According to records in our country's official history, as early as 84 AD, 《究不事》 sent envoys to establish friendly relations with our Later Han Dynasty, and presented a five-colored bird with "variegated embroidered wings" and precious animals such as rhinoceroses. It can be seen that from the distant end of the first century, Cambodia had already established friendly and good-neighborly relations with our country.

Chinese records about Cambodian customs began to appear in the Han Dynasty, full of praise and respect for the Cambodian people. Yang Fu, a consultant in the Later Han Dynasty, wrote in his 《Record of Strange Things》that the people of Funan "have special talents and skills," and are different from the others; Funan craftsmen were skilled in making large fans. It also introduced many local products of Cambodia, such as "Huoqi" which is yellow-red and resembles gold, and "? bamboo" which can be used as beams.

According to Kang Tai's 《Record of Funan》, before the Three Kingdoms period, our people often departed from the Jiangkou (the estuary near present-day Thuan An where the Huong River flows into the sea) of Lurong County in Rinan Prefecture (near present-day Hue), to go to various countries in Funan. French archaeologists have also discovered bronze mirrors and small Buddha statues from our Later Han Dynasty at the site of Oc Eo, an ancient international trading port that emerged in Cambodia in the first century AD (located in present-day Chau Doc, formerly belonging to Cambodia).

After the third century AD, the friendly relations between China and Cambodia became even closer. At this time, Funan, under the rule of Fan Man, possessed a vast territory "from the mouth of the Lancang River to the Bay of Bengal," and was a powerful kingdom in Southeast Asia. From 225 to 244, the Fan Dynasty of Funan sent envoys to our Wu Kingdom one after another to pay visits, presenting gifts such as "lusterous glaze surpassing all jade" (sapphire) and other local products. The Wu Kingdom also sent special envoys Kang Tai and Zhu Ying to Funan in 226 to make diplomatic return visits. After returning to China, Zhu Ying wrote 《Record of Strange Things of Funan》, and Kang Tai wrote 《Account of Foreign Countries in the Wu Period》.

From the Jin Dynasty to the Southern Dynasties, friendly envoys from Funan visited our country in an endless stream. They came seven times in the Jin Dynasty alone, and at least seventeen times during the Song, Qi, Liang, and Chen Dynasties, each time bringing many gifts, including tamed elephants, rhinoceroses, huoqi beads, various spices, Funan sugar cane, and fragrant shoes. Funan sugar cane was thirteen sections long and very sweet, enjoying a great reputation in our history. The fragrant shoes were special handicrafts carved from light balsa wood, which were not only convenient to wear and walk, but also could be used to resist the dampness of the earth. Our country treated the envoys with great courtesy each time, and the gifts in return were also very generous.

During this period, the economic ties and cultural exchanges between the two countries developed significantly. At the end of the Liu Song Dynasty (around 473-478), the Kingdom of Funan transported commercial goods to Guangzhou for mutual trade. According to 《Record of the Four Princes of Liang》, during the Tianjian period of the Liang Dynasty (502-519), Funan merchant ships also came to our country to trade in sapphire mirror surfaces. Funan was a country where Buddhism flourished. The spread of Buddhist culture was a major feature of ancient Sino-Cambodian cultural exchanges. During the Liang and Chen Dynasties (5th-6th centuries AD), many Buddhist monks from Funan were sent as envoys to our country to present Buddha statues and Sanskrit Buddhist scriptures, or to promote Buddhism in our country. Among them, such eminent monks as Sanghavarman and Mandra were respectfully invited by the Liang government to engage in the translation of Buddhist scriptures at translation sites such as the Zhengguan Temple and Cuilin Garden in Yangzhou, and the specially established "Funan Hall." The extant Chinese Tripitaka classics in our country were jointly translated by the two eminent monks.

In the late sixth century, Zhenla, a vassal state in the north of Funan, overthrew the Funan Dynasty by force, and established the Khmer Kingdom with the Khmer people as the leading core. The 《吉蔑》 and 《Zhenla Kingdom》、《文单国》、《婆镂国》 in our historical documents refer to this emerging dynasty in ancient Cambodia. In 617 AD, shortly after the establishment of the Zhenla Kingdom, it sent envoys from its capital, Sambor Prei Kuk, to our Sui Dynasty to re-establish friendly relations. During the Tang Dynasty, the friendly relations between the two countries were greatly strengthened, and envoys from the Zhenla Kingdom repeatedly brought valuable gifts to our country. During the Yonghui period of Emperor Gaozong of Tang (650-655) alone, they sent thirty-two white elephants, a special product. These elephants were specially trained, could kneel and dance, and often performed in the palace gardens during festivals. During the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, the prince of Zhenla also led his entourage to visit our country, and Emperor Xuanzong of Tang gave him the honorary title of "Guoyi Duwei." In the sixth year of the Dali period (771), the deputy king of Zhenla, Po Mi, and the queen also personally came to Chang'an, the capital of the Tang Dynasty and one of the largest cities in the world at that time, for a friendly visit. Emperor Daizong of Tang held a grand state banquet to warmly welcome them as if they were close relatives, and gave Po Mi the honorable title and Chinese name "Bin Han" (honored guest of China) as a souvenir when he returned to his country.

The Tang and Song Dynasties attached great importance to developing trade with countries in Asia and Africa; coupled with the continuous progress of our country's shipbuilding and navigation technology, international trade was very developed. Zhenla was also one of our country's important trading partners at that time. Our large sailboats, which were huge and extremely resistant to wind and waves, sailed to Zhenla with masts and yards connected, and Zhenla merchant ships also appeared from time to time in our country's seaports. The trading areas of Zhenla merchant ships were mainly Guangzhou and Jiaozhou, which belonged to our country during the Tang and Northern Song Dynasties, and Quanzhou, an emerging international trading port in Fujian during the late Southern Song Dynasty.

The friendly relations between the two countries were also amicable during the Yuan Dynasty. In the nineteenth year of the Zhiyuan period of Emperor Shizu of Yuan (1282), the Kingdom of Zhenla sent envoys Sulu Man to the Yuan Dynasty to establish friendly relations; in the twenty-second year of the Zhiyuan period (1285) and the second year of the Tianli period (1329), they sent friendly envoys to the Yuan court from their capital, Angkor, twice, presenting precious animals such as elephants and white apes and other local products. In order to reciprocate Zhenla's friendship, the Yuan government also sent envoys to Angkor in the first year of the Yuanzhen period (1295); and again sent Ma Zhaman to "Zhanla" (the new name of Zhenla during the period when it annexed the neighboring kingdom of Champa from 1190-1220) for a diplomatic visit in the first year of the Zhizhi period (1321). Zhou Daguan, a Chinese scholar who accompanied the Yuan court's first envoy to Zhenla, stayed for three years before returning to China, and wrote 《A Record of the Customs of Zhenla》 based on his own observations. This book recorded in detail the mountains, rivers, land, political system, products, customs and production activities of Zhenla, and depicted the simple and kind people, the hardworking and capable women, and the magnificent and exquisite Angkor monuments. At that time, the friendly trade between the two countries was also very close. The commodities exported by Zhenla were mainly jewelry products, ivory, rhino horns, spices, raw silk, emerald feathers, and various resins from forestry by-products; the goods supplied by our country to Zhenla included gold and silver, silk fabrics, mercury, tin, musk, tung oil, Wenzhou lacquer plates, Mingzhou woven mats, Quanzhou celadon wares, and linen, iron pots, copper plates, umbrellas, needles, wooden combs, etc. The people of Zhenla loved Chinese products very much. According to 《A Record of the Customs of Zhenla》, people "use Chinese tile plates or copper plates to hold rice; the underground is covered with Mingzhou grass mats"; the general bedding is "short beds" "made by Tang people"; even the gold umbrellas used by the nobles as ceremonial guards are most fond of being made of Chinese red silk. Chinese sailors also introduced Chinese geese to Zhenla for breeding. Until the first invasion of Zhenla by Siam (around 1350), this kind of trade relationship between China and Cambodia, which was conducive to each other's prosperity, was developing normally.

In terms of cultural exchanges between the two countries, in addition to the spread of Buddhist culture, music and dance are also a valuable part. During the Three Kingdoms Wu Dynasty and the Yuan Dynasty, Cambodia selected a group of musicians to come to our country; the Wu Dynasty also established a "Funan Music Bureau" to teach palace women. The Sui and Tang Dynasties both had Funan music, taught by Funan musicians to the singing girls of the harem, who performed at festival banquets. The Cambodian people enriched the content of our country's classical song and dance with their distinctive ethnic music and dance. China's cultural achievements also had a good influence on Cambodia. The solemn and magnificent Royal Palace in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, is surrounded by battlements-shaped yellow walls, with Pi Xiu and mighty stone generals lined up on both sides, which absorbed our country's architectural art and adopted our country's architectural style. From the Qin Dynasty to the early Han Dynasty, our country used October as the beginning of the year. According to 《A Record of the Customs of Zhenla》, Cambodia still used the same calendar until the fourteenth century. Cambodia's large-scale fireworks displays during festivals were also introduced from our country.

In the early Ming Dynasty, the friendly relations between the people of China and Cambodia became even closer. According to historical records, during the period from the fourth year to the twenty-fourth year of Hongwu (1371-1391) alone, Zhenla sent envoys to the Ming court twelve times to establish friendly relations and present gifts. Each envoy was treated with great courtesy by the Ming government, and the gifts in return were also very generous. Emperor Taizu of Ming, because Zhenla loved our country's porcelain, sent special envoys to bring a large number of porcelain as gifts. During the Yongle period (1403-1424), the two countries still sent envoys to each other frequently. Emperor Chengzu of Ming sent Zheng He on seven voyages to the West, and also paid friendly visits to Zhenla. After the mid-Ming Dynasty, although Cambodia faced serious difficulties due to the successive invasions of Siam and the Portuguese and Dutch colonialists, which interrupted its brotherly relations with our country; the trade activities between the people of the two countries were still very active. The goods transported by our country's merchant ships to Cambodia included gold and silver, burnt pearls, silk fabrics, and local products such as Jiangxi porcelain, Fujian sugar and fruits, which the Cambodian people "all loved." In the late Ming Dynasty, the trade area continued to expand, and the quantity of exports increased year by year.

Cambodia's current name first appeared during the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty. The Qing Dynasty also called it the "Kingdom of Phnom Penh" because of Cambodia's new capital after the fifteenth century. Due to the continuous armed interference by foreign countries in Cambodia's internal affairs and the endless wars, Cambodia was still unable to restore its interrupted friendly relations with our country during the Qing Dynasty. The mutually beneficial trade between the people of the two countries continued to develop. By the 1880s, when French colonialists invaded and occupied Cambodia, the traditional friendly trade between our two peoples was hindered and destroyed, and finally declined and was cut off.

The friendly relations between the people of China and Cambodia are also reflected in the activities of overseas Chinese in Cambodia. Our people have resided in Cambodia for a long history. They abide by laws and regulations, respect local customs, live in harmony with the Cambodian people, intermarry with each other, and form relatives. They are engaged in economic activities in various fields such as commerce, agriculture, animal husbandry, shipbuilding, fishery, and planting, and participate in development and construction projects together with the Cambodian people, dedicating their hard work for generations, and making many contributions to Cambodia's economic development and social prosperity. During the more than 80 years of French colonial rule, the patriotic people of Cambodia rose up in struggle one after another. The vast number of overseas Chinese not only expressed deep sympathy, but also joined the torrent of uprisings together with Vietnamese overseas Chinese, dedicating their strength to the cause of Cambodia's national liberation.

For more than 1,800 years, there have never been any conflicts between the people of China and Cambodia. Since China and Cambodia each rebuilt independent countries and restored the historical ties that had been severed by the long-term aggression of Western colonialism, the friendly relations between the two countries have gained unprecedented development and become a model of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. We very much cherish the friendly history between the people of China and Cambodia, and warmly wish the friendship between the people of the two countries to last as long as the Lancang River and the Tonle Sap River.

    中柬友好具有悠久的历史
    吴紫金
    柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王应我国刘少奇主席和周恩来总理的邀请，第三次带着柬埔寨人民的深厚情谊前来访问我国。这是中柬关系上的一件大喜事，它必将促进两国友好合作的发展。在中柬两国人民友谊日益巩固和发展的今天，我们回顾两国先人长期友好相处的历史，是很有意义的。
    对于中国人民来说，柬埔寨这个位置在印度支那半岛南部、具有悠久历史和文化的国家，是亲切的兄弟邻邦。柬埔寨在我国最早的文献上，被称为《夫南》、《扶南》或《究（古音，读甘）不事》。据我国正史记载，早在公元84年，《究不事》即派出使者同我国后汉王朝通好，并赠送“斑色绣翼、五采成章”的五色鸟和珍贵动物犀牛。可见，从遥远的第一世纪末期，柬埔寨就已和我国建立了友好的睦邻关系。
    我国有关柬埔寨风土人情的记述，在汉代开始出现，其中充满了对柬埔寨人民的赞扬和尊敬。像后汉议郎杨孚的《异物志》里写道，夫南人“特有才巧”，不与众同；扶南手工匠师精于制作大扇。此外还介绍了柬埔寨黄赤似金的“火齐”、可作栋梁的“?竹”等许多土特产。
    据康泰《扶南记》记载，三国以前，我国人民就已经常从日南郡卢容县的江口（今顺化附近球海大海湾西岬北边入海的海口）出发，前往扶南各国。法国考古学家也曾在柬埔寨于公元一世纪兴起的古代国际贸易港奥克·伊奥的遗址（位于原属柬埔寨的朱笃境内），发现我国后汉时代的青铜镜和小佛像等出土器。
    公元三世纪以后，中柬两国的邦交进一步密切起来。这时扶南在范蔓的统治下拥有“自澜沧江口达于榜葛刺湾”的广大领土，是东南亚一个强大的王国。从225到244年间，扶南范氏王朝曾接连派遣使节前来我国的吴国聘问，馈赠的礼品有“采泽光润、逾于众玉”的琉璃
  （青宝石）和其他方物。吴国也在226年派出专使康泰、朱应到扶南，作外交上的回拜。回国后，朱应写有《扶南异物志》，康泰写有《吴时外国传》。
    从晋代直到南朝，扶南聘问我国的友谊使者络绎不绝。只在晋代就来过七次，到宋、齐、梁、陈诸王朝至少有十七次，每次都带来许多礼物，包括驯象、犀牛、火齐珠、各种香料、扶南蔗和抱香履等。扶南蔗一丈三节，非常甘脆，在我国历史上是极享美名的。抱香履是用轻如通草的枹木刻凿成的特种手工艺品，不但穿来行走便捷，还可用以抵御卑湿的地气。我国对历次来使都优礼接待，回赠的礼物也很丰厚。
    在这期间，两国的经济联系和文化交流都有显著的开展。刘宋末年（约在473—478），扶南国就载运商货到广州互市。据《梁四公子记》记载，梁天监中（502—519），扶南的大商船也来过我国进行青宝石镜面的贸易。扶南是一个佛教昌盛的国家。佛教文化的传播，是古代中、柬文化交流的一大特点。在梁、陈两朝（公元五——六世纪），扶南有不少佛教僧侣被派为使者来我国赍赠佛像和梵文佛经，或来我国弘法。其中如高僧僧伽婆罗和曼陀罗，都被梁政府礼聘在扬州正观寺、萃林园和特设的“扶南馆”等译经场从事迻译佛教典籍。我国现存的汉文大藏经典，就是两位高僧共同译出的。
    到了六世纪后期，扶南北部的藩属真腊，以兵力推翻了扶南王朝，建立了以吉蔑族为领导核心的高棉王国。我国史籍文献上所谓《吉蔑》和《真腊国》、《文单国》、《婆镂国》，就是指的柬埔寨古代这个新兴的王朝。公元617年，真腊国建立不久，便从首都三隆派出使者到我国的隋朝来重修旧好。唐时两国的邦交大大加强，真腊国的使者屡次携带贵重礼仪来我国聘问。仅是唐高宗永徽一至六年（650—655），就送来特产的白象三十二头。这些大象都经过特殊训练，会跪拜舞蹈，每逢节日常在宫苑中表演。唐玄宗时，真腊王子还曾率领随员访问我国，唐玄宗赠以“果毅都尉”的荣誉称号。大历六年（771），真腊副国王婆弥和王后又亲自来到唐王朝的京都、当时世界上的大城市之一的长安进行友好访问。唐代宗就像接待至亲一样举行盛大国宴热烈欢迎，并在婆弥回国时赠给尊贵的称号和中国名字“宾汉”（中国的上宾）作为纪念。
    唐、宋两个王朝非常重视开展对亚非各国的贸易；兼以我国造船和航海技术的不断进步，国际贸易十分发达。真腊当时也是我国的重要通商国家之一。我国形体庞大、极能抵抗风涛的巨型帆船，连桅接樯地开到真腊去，真腊商船也不时出现在我国的海港上。真腊商舶的贸易地区，唐及北宋主要是广州和当时属于我国的交州，南宋末年则大都在福建新兴的国际贸易港——泉州进行。
    两国邦交在元时也是亲善的。元世祖至元十九年（1282）时，真腊国就派使者速鲁曼入元订交；至元二十二年（1285）和天历二年（1329）又从它的国都吴哥两次向元廷派遣友谊使节，赠送大象、白猿等名贵动物和其他土特产。元政府为了回答真腊的友情，也在元贞元年（1295）派遣使节前往吴哥报聘；至治元年（1321）再次派出马扎蛮到“占腊”（真腊在1190—1220年间兼并邻国占城时期的新国名）进行外交访问。曾经随同元廷首次使节往访真腊的我国学者周达观，留居三年才回国，根据自己的见闻写了《真腊风土记》。这部书翔实地记载了真腊的山川国土、政治制度、物产风俗和生产活动，描绘了当地淳朴善良的人民、勤劳能干的妇女和辉煌精致的吴哥古迹。当时两国的友好贸易也很密切，真腊输出的商品主要是珠宝制成品、象牙、犀角、香料、生丝、翠毛和林业副产品的各种树脂；我国供应真腊的货物则有金银、缣帛、水银、锡镴、麝香、桐油、温州漆盘、明州织席、泉州青瓷器和麻布、铁锅、铜盘、雨伞、针、木梳等。真腊人民很爱好中国产品。据《真腊风土记》记载，人们“盛饭用中国瓦盘或铜盘；地下所铺者明州之草席”；一般卧具是“唐人制作”的“矮床”；就是贵族用作仪仗的金伞，也最喜以中国的红绢张造。中国船员还曾把中国鹅传到真腊繁殖。到暹罗第一次侵略真腊（1350年间）为止，中柬两国这种有助于彼此繁荣的贸易联系一直是正常发展的。
    在两国文化交流方面，除了佛教文化的传播，音乐舞蹈也是一个可贵的部分。在三国吴朝以及元代，柬埔寨都曾选送一批乐师到我国来；吴王朝还曾为此建立了“扶南乐署”来教宫人。隋、唐两王朝都置有扶南乐，由扶南乐师传授后宫歌女曲艺，在节庆宴享会上献演。柬埔寨人民以他们富于民族特色的音乐舞蹈，丰富了我国古典歌舞的内容。我国的文化成果，对柬埔寨也有良好的影响。柬埔寨首都金边的庄严华丽的王宫，周围环着雉堞形的黄墙，两旁并列着貔貅和威武的石将军，就是吸收了我国的建筑艺术，采用了我国的建筑形式。我国自秦代到汉初，都以10月作为岁首，据《真腊风土记》记载，柬埔寨直到十四世纪还通行着同一历法。柬埔寨每逢年节大放烟火爆杖，也是我国传去的。
    明代初叶，中柬两国人民的友好关系更加紧密。据史书所载，只洪武四年到二十四年（1371—1391）的一段期间，真腊派到明廷通好和赠礼的使节就达十二次。每次的来使都受到明政府的优礼款待，回赠的礼物也极丰厚。明太祖因真腊喜爱我国瓷器，曾派遣专使带了大批瓷器往赠。永乐时期（1403—1424），两国仍然通聘不绝。明成祖派遣郑和七下西洋，也曾到真腊进行友好访问。明中叶以后，虽然柬埔寨由于遭到暹罗和葡萄牙、荷兰殖民主义者的相继侵略，面临严重的困难，打断了同我国的兄弟邦交；但两国人民之间的贸易活动还很活跃。我国商船运往柬埔寨的货品，有金银、烧珠和绫罗杂绘，还有江西瓷器、福建糖品和果品等土特产，柬埔寨人民“皆所嗜好”。在明代末叶，贸易面不断扩大，出口物的数量年年增长。
    柬埔寨的今名，最初出现在明万历年间。清代又曾以柬埔寨在十五世纪以后的新首都而称它为“金边国”。由于外国连连以武装干涉柬埔寨内政，战争不息，清时柬埔寨仍没有能够同我国恢复中断的邦交。两国人民互利互济的贸易，则继续向前发展。到了十九世纪八十年代，法国殖民主义者侵占了柬埔寨，我们两国人民之间的传统友好贸易便遭到阻挠和破坏，终于由衰落而陷于断绝。
    中柬两国人民的友好关系，还表现在旅柬华侨的活动方面。我国人民侨居柬埔寨已有久远的历史，他们遵守法纪、尊重当地的风俗习惯，与柬埔寨人民和睦相处、互通婚姻，结成亲戚。他们从事商业、农业、畜牧业、造船业、渔业、种植业等各方面的经济活动，并和柬埔寨人民一道参加开发建设事业，世世代代付出了辛勤劳动，对柬埔寨的经济发展和社会繁荣作出了不少贡献。在法国长达八十多年的殖民统治时期，柬埔寨爱国人民前仆后继地起来斗争，广大华侨不仅表示深切的同情，并且和越南侨民一起，投入起义斗争的洪流，为柬埔寨的民族解放事业献出力量。
    一千八百多年来，中柬两国人民从来没有发生过任何冲突。自从中柬两国各自重建了独立的国家，并且恢复了由于西方殖民主义的长期侵略而被切断的历史联系以来，两国的友好关系更获得了空前的发展，成为不同社会制度国家和平共处的榜样。我们非常珍贵中柬两国人民之间的友好历史，并热烈祝愿两国人民的友谊，如澜沧江和洞里萨河一样万古长流。（附图片）
