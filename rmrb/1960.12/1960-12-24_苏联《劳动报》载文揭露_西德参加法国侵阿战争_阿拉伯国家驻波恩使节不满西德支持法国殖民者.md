Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: TASS Moscow, December 21st: The "Labor News" published an article on the 21st, using facts to expose West Germany's direct participation in the criminal war against the Algerian people.

The article recounts that as early as May 1955, Bonn held a secret meeting with Paris. The Bonn government allowed French militarists to freely lure West German and West Berlin youth to join the French Foreign Legion. Not long ago, the Bonn government also promised to create various conditions on West German territory to recruit young people to Algeria.

The article points out that currently, 70% of the mercenaries in the French Foreign Legion are Germans. It argues that, in this way, Bonn is directly participating in the criminal war against the Algerian people.

The article further points out that West German rulers not only send young people to the slaughterhouse, but they also send their officers to North Africa for inspection activities. In the past four years, West German Defense Minister Strauss, as well as West German generals Heusinger and Speidel, have visited Algeria. West German Nazis are introducing their murderous "experience" from World War II to French militarists. Adenauer's son, Max Adenauer, recently visited Algeria. He openly declared his full support for the bloody and brutal acts of the French colonialists.

When discussing the main reasons for Bonn's concern about Algerian affairs, the article writes that the interests of West German monopoly organizations lie in quietly squeezing their French "friends" to establish themselves in the Sahara, because the Sahara underground contains inexhaustible oil and other mineral deposits. West German monopoly organizations want to use the blood of deceived young people to do their dirty business.

Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, December 20th: Arab countries' envoys to West Germany have expressed regret over the Bonn government's support for French colonialists in slaughtering the Algerian people.

According to a communique issued today by the Moroccan Embassy in West Germany, the embassies of Arab countries, as well as Ghana, Liberia, and Indonesia, in West Germany pointed out last week: "The assistance that NATO countries, especially Germany (West Germany), provide to France within the framework of NATO is used to support France's aggressive forces in Algeria."

The Moroccan ambassador, on behalf of the Arab countries' envoys to West Germany, visited the Bonn Foreign Ministry to express regret that the French Foreign Legion, in which many West Germans participate, is being used against civilians in Algiers, and that the financial assistance that West Germany gives to France is being used to purchase weapons for the colonial war in Algeria.

    苏联《劳动报》载文揭露
    西德参加法国侵阿战争
    阿拉伯国家驻波恩使节不满西德支持法国殖民者
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科21日讯：《劳动报》21日刊登了一篇文章，用事实揭露西德直接参与反对阿尔及利亚人民的罪恶战争。
    这篇文章追述说，还在1955年5月，波恩就同巴黎举行了秘密会议。波恩政府允许法国黩武主义者自由引诱西德和西柏林青年去参加法国的外籍军团。前不久，波恩政府又答应在西德领土上创造各种条件，以便能够搜罗青年到阿尔及利亚去。
    文章指出，现在，法国外籍军团中70％的雇佣兵是德国人。他认为，这样一来，波恩就直接参与了反对阿尔及利亚人民的罪恶战争。
    文章进一步指出，西德统治者不仅把青年派往了屠杀场，他们还派遣自己的军官到北非进行视察活动。最近四年来，西德国防部长施特劳斯以及西德将领豪辛格和斯派达尔等都先后到过阿尔及利亚。西德纳粹分子向法国黩武主义者介绍自己在第二次世界大战中的杀人“经验”。阿登纳的儿子马克斯·阿登纳不久前访问过阿尔及利亚。他公开声言完全支持法国殖民主义者血腥的残暴行为。
    文章在谈到波恩关心阿尔及利亚事务的主要原因时写道，西德垄断组织的利益在于：悄悄地挤一挤自己的法国“朋友”，使自己在撒哈拉固定下来，因为在撒哈拉地下蕴藏有取之不尽的石油等矿藏。西德垄断组织想用受骗的青年的鲜血来做自己肮脏的买卖。
    新华社波恩20日电　阿拉伯国家驻西德使节对波恩政府支持法国殖民者屠杀阿尔及利亚人民表示遗憾。
    据摩洛哥驻西德大使馆今天发表的公报，阿拉伯国家以及加纳、利比里亚和印度尼西亚驻西德的使馆上周曾经指出：“北大西洋公约组织国家，特别是德国（西德），在北大西洋公约组织范围内给予法国的援助，是用来支持法国在阿尔及利亚的侵略势力的。”
    摩洛哥大使为此曾经代表阿拉伯国家驻西德使节访问波恩外交部，对于有不少西德人参加的法国外籍军团被用来对付阿尔及尔的平民，对于西德给予法国的财政援助被用来购置进行阿尔及利亚殖民战争的武器，表示遗憾。
