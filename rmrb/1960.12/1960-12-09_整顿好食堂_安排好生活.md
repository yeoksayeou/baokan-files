    Straighten Up the Dining Halls, Arrange Life Well
    Cadres' "Life Work Day"
    Since the autumn of this year, the Party Committee of the Dongfeng Bixibake People's Commune in Kuqa County, Xinjiang, has implemented a system of cadres' "Life Work Day" to continuously improve dining hall work and effectively promote production.
    The specific methods of the cadre "Life Work Day" system are: cadres leading production must also lead life; cadres working in teams must set aside one to two days a week to run dining halls and welfare undertakings, conduct monthly inspections and evaluations of life management work, and regularly organize visiting groups to visit commune members' homes to understand their difficulties and solicit opinions on life matters. After this system was rapidly promoted throughout the commune, cadres became deeply involved in grasping life, and a new atmosphere quickly formed, transforming the appearance of dining halls and other welfare work.
      Vigorously Develop Dining Hall "Experimental Plots"
    In Ji'an County, Jiangxi Province, cadres at the county, commune, and team levels have established 1,670 dining hall "experimental plots."
    Cadres running dining hall "experimental plots" have explored and summarized many experiences in improving the lives of the masses. For example, Peng Yuxiu, director of the Women's Federation of the Qulai Commune, helped the management personnel of the Zhuanghu Team in the Changming Brigade to adopt the principle of determining rations based on the number of people, assigning quotas to households, delivering grain to the hall, and allowing savings to be retained by the individual. They adopted the method of "daily announcement, five-day summary, and ten-day realization" for the grain saved by each commune member, effectively saving grain.
      Elect Commune Member Representatives to "Help Cook"
    In the Wusi People's Commune of Yuxian County, Henan Province, most of the 177 public dining halls have recently implemented a system of commune member representatives (democratically elected by the masses) "helping cook."
    The main task of the commune member representatives is to understand the opinions of the masses at any time, improve the work of the dining hall, and assist the cooks in rationally arranging short-term grain, vegetables, oil, salt, and coal. Since the implementation of the "helping cook" system, the work of the dining hall has been greatly improved, and generally, it has been possible to cook according to the number of people, distribute food fairly and reasonably, and diversify the food.
      Grain, Vegetables, and Fuel Implemented
    While overfulfilling the state grain purchase task, the Gaocun Management Area of the Chengguan Commune in Yicheng County, Shanxi Province, organized a working group consisting of the Party Branch Secretary, the Management Committee Director, the Dining Hall Steward, commune member representatives, and cooks to inspect and verify the food rations, vegetables, oil, meat, seasonings, salt, and other materials for the dining hall for a period of time to come.
    Promote New-Style Cookware
    Cadres of the Luomo Management Area of the Miluo Commune in Shuicheng County, Guizhou Province, helped each dining hall to vigorously carry out cookware reform. These cadres led cookware reform and imitation, repair groups to each dining hall to organize new cookware operation demonstrations and impart usage techniques.
    Due to the major reform of cookware, some dining halls have achieved semi-mechanization, and the number of dining hall service personnel has been reduced from the original 192 to the current 66, which has strongly supported the front line of agricultural production.

### 整顿好食堂  安排好生活

    整顿好食堂  安排好生活
    干部“生活工作日”
    今年秋季以来，新疆库车县东风比西巴克人民公社党委实行干部“生活工作日”制度，不断改进食堂工作，有力地促进了生产。
    干部“生活工作日”制度的具体办法是：领导生产的干部必须同时领导生活；下队工作的干部每周要腾出一至两天时间办食堂和福利事业，每月对生活管理工作检查评比一次，以及定期组织访问小组登门了解社员困难和征求对生活方面的意见。这个制度在全公社迅速推广后，干部深入抓生活，很快就形成风气，食堂等福利工作面貌为之一新。
      大搞食堂“试验田”
    江西省吉安县县、社、队三级干部办的食堂“试验田”已达一千六百七十个。
    干部办食堂“试验田”，已经摸索和总结了许多搞好群众生活的经验。如曲赖公社妇联主任彭玉秀，在长明大队庄湖小队食堂帮助管理人员根据以人定量，指标到户，粮食到堂，凭票吃饭，节约归己的原则，对每户社员节约的粮食，采取“一天一公布，五天一小结，十天一兑现”的办法，有效地节约了粮食。
      选举社员代表“帮厨”
    河南禹县五四人民公社，一百七十七个公共食堂，最近大部分实行了社员代表（由群众民主选举）“帮厨”制度。
    社员代表主要是随时了解群众意见，改进食堂工作，同时协助炊事人员合理安排短期内的粮、菜、油、盐和用煤。实行“帮厨”制度以来，食堂工作大有改进，一般都做到了按人做饭，打饭公平合理，饭食多样化等。
      粮、菜、燃料落实
    山西翼城县城关公社高村管理区在超额完成国家粮食征购任务的同时，组织了有党支部书记、管委会主任、食堂事务长、社员代表、炊事员等参加的工作组，对食堂今后一段时期的口粮、菜蔬、油料、肉食、调料、食盐等物资样样检查过秤，验收落实。
    推广新式炊具
    贵州水城县米萝公社倮摩管理区干部帮助各食堂大搞炊具改革。这些干部带领炊具改革和仿制、修补小组，到各食堂组织新炊具操作表演，传授使用技术。
    由于大改炊具，有些食堂已经实现了土机械化，食堂服务人员由原来的一百九十二人减为现在的六十六人，有力地支援了农业生产第一线。
