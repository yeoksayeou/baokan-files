The October night was brightly lit, with stars twinkling, and the outlines of the tall buildings on both sides of East Chang'an Avenue appeared very soft in the night. The lights in the Beijing Hotel, seen from afar, looked like stars in the night sky, very dazzling.

The lights in the banquet hall on the seventh floor were even more brilliant, shining as bright as day. As the banquet filled with fervent friendship was coming to an end, Antonio Ma. Macias Dominguez, the representative of our beloved Cuban people, stood up. After finishing his passionate speech, he untied the knot of the red ribbon and pulled out a roll of sparkling paper from the coffee-colored leather case. From more than 20,000 kilometers away, he brought me the most precious gift—a half-newspaper-sized piece of snow-white paper with thick red borders around it, densely printed with Spanish text. This was a specially printed, solemn "Declaration of Havana."

I took this most precious gift and gazed at it with deep respect. It took me to the beautiful land of Latin America.

Four hundred and sixty-eight years ago, the American continent was still unknown to people. The inhabitants of this continent lived peaceful and quiet lives. On October 12, 1492, Columbus, supported and funded by the Spanish colonial rulers, led a navigation team to Guanahani Island, now San Salvador. Sixteen days later, they arrived at the northeastern coast of Cuba. From then on, although the Americas ended its isolated state of separation from the Old World, the Spanish and Portuguese pirates conquered this new continent with fire and sword, plunging it into an abyss of suffering. The dark rule of colonialism lasted for more than three hundred years!

The history of more than three hundred years of Spanish and Portuguese colonial rule in Latin America is a history of the Latin American people's heroic struggle against imperialism and colonialism. Every page of these more than three hundred years of history is filled with blood and tears, on one side, extravagance and shamelessness, and on the other, solemnity and justice.

As early as 1790, half a million black people in Haiti, under the leadership of the black leader Toussaint Louverture, launched a heroic struggle against the French colonialists. After thirteen years of arduous and complex battles, they defeated approximately 60,000 invading troops from France, Britain, and Spain, and finally declared independence in 1803. This was the first independent republic established in Latin America. The victory of the Haitian struggle became the prelude to the national independence movement that swept across Latin America from 1810 to 1825, in which the people of various Latin American countries fought against Spanish and Portuguese colonial rule.

The prelude has begun. The flames of anger for national independence are burning fiercely throughout Latin America. From south to north, from east to west, the torch of revolution is raised everywhere. In the ranks of the struggle are the people of Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, Chile, and Argentina. From the independence of Haiti until the establishment of the Republic of Cuba in 1902, Spanish colonial rule in Latin America basically came to an end.

But the pirates left, and the jackals came.

As early as 1846, the United States annexed most of Mexico's territory through aggressive wars. In 1898, the United States, through another aggressive war, controlled Cuba and occupied Puerto Rico, making it its colony. In 1903, the United States forcibly occupied the Panama Canal, euphemistically calling it obtaining "permanent lease rights." From 1898 to 1930 alone, the United States shamelessly carried out open armed intervention in nine countries in the Caribbean region. The United States also constantly created a series of military coups in various Latin American countries, established military bases in many important strategic locations, cultivated its lackeys in many countries, and established dictatorial regimes. Economically, it artificially created single economies in various Latin American countries to facilitate its control and plunder. Countless dollars were forcibly flowed from various Latin American countries into the vaults of Wall Street bosses every year. Using the "Monroe Doctrine" as a fig leaf for aggression and interference, and through the "Organization of American States," an instrument of aggression and interference, the United States carried out extremely vicious plunder and occupation of various Latin American countries, engaging in crude and shameless aggression and interference, attempting to inherit the mantle of the Spanish pirates and become the master of Latin America.

But the Latin America of today is no longer the Latin America of 1492, nor is it the Latin America of 1810-1825. The people of various Latin American countries are increasingly awakening. In order to oppose U.S. imperialism, safeguard national independence, and strive for democratic freedom, they are raising the revolutionary torch that was ignited one hundred and fifty years ago even higher.

A vast and surging wave of national democratic struggle has swept across the entire Latin America. Its scale, depth, impact, and complexity of struggle far exceed the struggle for independence from 1810 to 1825.

Leaving aside the distant past, starting from 1955, the dictatorial regimes supported by U.S. imperialism have collapsed one after another in the face of the giant wave of people's revolutionary struggles. Remón of Panama collapsed, Perón of Argentina collapsed, Osorio of El Salvador collapsed, Odría of Peru collapsed, Somoza of Nicaragua collapsed, Magloire of Haiti collapsed, Jiménez of Venezuela collapsed, and two years ago, Batista, the tyrant of Cuba, also collapsed.

The victory of the Cuban people's revolution, led by Prime Minister Fidel Castro, has opened a new page in the history of the people's revolutionary struggles in various Latin American countries. The heroic Cuban people have set a shining example, thereby pushing the national democratic movement of the people of various Latin American countries into a new stage. Cuba, located only ninety nautical miles from the territory of U.S. imperialism, with an area of only over 110,000 square kilometers and a population of only over six million, defeated the aggressive forces of U.S. imperialism and its lackey Batista, thereby also shattering the deceptive myth of U.S. imperialism being untouchable. The victory of the Cuban revolution not only encouraged the people of various Latin American countries, but also encouraged the people of all countries in the world.

U.S. imperialism has built a huge wall of aggression in various Latin American countries, invisible but perceptible everywhere, attempting to block the revolutionary torrent of the people of various Latin American countries. The Cuban wave broke through the U.S. imperialist wall of aggression, rushing thousands of miles, vast and mighty, unstoppable.

When I visited Latin America in the second half of 1958 and the first half of 1959, I could see everywhere the wave of people's revolutionary struggle and the anger and hatred towards U.S. imperialism. In Rio de Janeiro, I lived on Vargas Avenue. When Dulles, this despicable imperialist, visited Brazil and passed through this avenue, no one welcomed him. After he passed this road under the protection of American guards, all the people nearby came out with brooms in their hands to sweep Vargas Avenue, because the road that the imperialist had walked was dirty. I had only been in São Paulo for a few days when Rockefeller, this monopoly oligarch, happened to visit. Black flags were hung on the buildings of a department store to mourn the visit of the monopoly oligarch. Argentina's oil, under the name of U.S. imperialist exploration and "funding," had all become American. Not only did they seize the oil, but they also occupied the land and established military bases. A famous educator from Uruguay said to me with extreme resentment: Fortunately, Uruguay does not have oil, and we live relatively peacefully; otherwise, U.S. imperialism would not fail to covet Uruguay. Coffee workers in Brazil and copper miners in Chile all told me that they lived in very wealthy coffee plantations and mines, but lived in extreme poverty. When I visited a city on the Pacific coast of Chile, the U.S. imperialist navy was conducting exercises on the Chilean seas, attempting to use a show of force to suppress the revolutionary struggle of the people of various Latin American countries.

Revolutionary struggle is not afraid of suppression. The more it is suppressed, the stronger the flames of revolution become!

On January 2, 1959, we were awakened by a clap of spring thunder in Montevideo: The Cuban people's revolutionary armed forces, led by Fidel Castro, entered Havana yesterday, and Batista, the tyrant who climbed from sergeant to the dictatorial throne, collapsed! From then on, the revolutionary flames of the people of various Latin American countries became even more vigorous than before.

Once the torch of revolution is lit, it will never be extinguished.

In response to the shameful "Declaration of San José," the National Assembly of the Cuban people, held in Havana on September 2 this year, solemnly adopted the "Declaration of Havana," as the declaration stated: "In the name of the Cuban people, it sends out a voice that embodies the hopes and determination of the people of various Latin American countries."

This declaration is not only the charter of the Cuban people's revolution, but also the charter of the people's revolution in various Latin American countries. The victory of the Cuban people's revolution and the "Declaration of Havana" are the torch of revolution, which illuminates the entire sky above Cuba, and also illuminates the road of revolutionary progress for the people of various Latin American countries.

Cuba is the last country in Latin America to get rid of Spanish colonial rule. Now, it is the first country to get rid of U.S. imperialism. The victory of the Cuban people's revolution has opened up a path for the people of various Latin American countries to move forward!

On the occasion of commemorating the 150th anniversary of the struggle for national independence in various Latin American countries and celebrating the second anniversary of the victory of the Cuban Revolution, I took out the "Declaration of Havana" that a Cuban friend gave me two months ago from the bookshelf, and I express my highest respect for it. On the declaration, I seem to see two hundred million people in Latin America holding high the torch of revolution, advancing triumphantly!

I firmly believe that a new Latin America will be born in the flames of revolution!

    革命的火炬
    周而复
    10月的夜晚，华灯璀灿，繁星闪烁，东长安街两旁高大建筑物的轮廓在夜色中显得十分柔和。北京饭店里的灯光远远望去像是夜空的星光，非常耀眼。
    七楼宴会厅里的灯光更加灿烂，照得如同白昼一般。当洋溢着炽热的友谊的宴会快结束的时候，我们敬爱的古巴人民的代表安东尼奥·马·迈卡斯多明格斯站了起来，讲完了充满热情的话，他解开红色绸带的结子，从咖啡色的皮筒子里，抽出一卷闪闪发光的纸，从两万多公里以外给我带来了最珍贵的礼品——半张报纸大小的雪白的纸上，四周镶着红色的粗边，里面印着密密麻麻的西班牙文，这是特别印制的庄严的《哈瓦那宣言》。
    我接过这份最珍贵的礼品，怀着崇高的敬意注视着它。它把我带到拉丁美洲的美丽的土地上。
    在四百六十八年前，美洲这个大陆还不被人们知道。这个洲上的居民过着和平而又安静的生活。1492年10月12日哥伦布在西班牙殖民统治者的支持和资助下，率领着航海队来到了瓜纳哈尼岛，也就是现在的圣萨尔瓦多。十六天以后，他们又到了古巴东北海岸。从此，美洲虽然结束了和旧世界隔离的孤立状态，但是西班牙和葡萄牙的海盗们，用火与剑征服了这个新大陆，使这个大陆堕入苦难的深渊，殖民主义者的黑暗统治竟达三百多年之久！
    西班牙和葡萄牙殖民者统治拉丁美洲三百多年的历史，是拉丁美洲各国人民的反对帝国主义和殖民主义进行英勇斗争的历史。这三百多年的历史的每一页上，充满了鲜血和热泪，一面是荒淫和无耻，一面是庄严和正义。
    远在1790年，海地五十万黑人在黑人领袖杜桑的领导下，发起反抗法国殖民者的英勇斗争，经历了十三年艰苦复杂的战斗，击溃了法国、英国和西班牙的大约六万的侵略军，终于在1803年宣布独立。这是在拉丁美洲建立的第一个独立共和国。海地斗争的胜利成为1810—1825年拉丁美洲各国人民为反对西班牙和葡萄牙殖民统治席卷整个拉丁美洲的民族独立运动的序幕。
    序幕揭开了。争取民族独立的怒火熊熊地燃烧着整个拉丁美洲，从南到北，从东到西，到处高举着革命的火炬，在斗争的行列里有墨西哥、危地马拉、洪都拉斯，萨尔瓦多、尼加拉瓜、哥斯达黎加，巴拿马、多米尼加、委内瑞拉，哥伦比亚、厄瓜多尔、秘鲁、玻利维亚、巴拉圭、智利和阿根廷等国的人民。从海地独立开始，直到1902年古巴共和国成立，基本结束了西班牙在拉丁美洲的殖民统治。
    但是，海盗去了，豺狼又来了。
    早在1846年美国就通过侵略战争，并吞了墨西哥的大半领土。1898年，美国又通过侵略战争，控制了古巴，并且侵占了波多黎各，成为它的殖民地。1903年美国又强占了巴拿马运河，美其名曰取得“永久租让权”。仅从1898年到1930年，美国先后对加勒比海地区的九个国家无耻地进行公开的武装干涉。美国还不断在拉丁美洲各国制造一系列的军事政变，在许多重要的战略地点建立了军事基地，在许多国家培植它的走狗，建立独裁政权。在经济上人为地把拉丁美洲各国造成单一经济，便于它的控制和掠夺，每年有数不尽的美元从拉丁美洲各国被迫流到华尔街老板们的库房里。用“门罗主义”做为侵略和干涉的遮羞布，通过“美洲国家组织”这个侵略和干涉的工具，美国对拉丁美洲各国进行穷凶极恶的掠夺和霸占，粗暴无耻的侵略和干涉，企图继承西班牙海盗的衣钵，想做拉丁美洲的主子。
    但是现在的拉丁美洲已经不是1492年的拉丁美洲了，也不是1810—1825年的拉丁美洲了。拉丁美洲各国人民日益觉醒，为了反对美帝国主义、维护民族独立、争取民主自由，他们更高地举起一百五十年前燃烧起来的革命火炬。
    一个声势浩大、汹涌澎湃的民族民主斗争的浪潮席卷了整个拉丁美洲，那规模、那深度、那影响和那斗争的复杂性都远远超过了1810—1825年的争取独立的斗争。
    远的且不去说，就从1955年算起，美帝国主义一手扶植的独裁政权，在人民革命斗争的巨浪面前，一个个垮台了，巴拿马的里蒙垮台了，阿根廷的庇隆垮台了，萨尔瓦多的奥索里欧垮台了，秘鲁的俄德利亚垮台了，尼加拉瓜的索摩萨垮台了，海地的马格鲁阿垮台了，委内瑞拉的希门尼斯垮台了，在两年以前，古巴的巴蒂斯塔这个暴君也垮台了。
    以菲德尔·卡斯特罗总理为首的古巴人民革命的胜利，揭开了拉丁美洲各国人民革命斗争历史的新的一页。英雄的古巴人民树立了光辉的榜样，从而把拉丁美洲各国人民的民族民主运动推入一个新的阶段。距离美帝国主义国土不过九十浬的古巴，面积不过十一万多平方公里，人口也不过六百多万，但是打败了美帝国主义的侵略势力和它的走狗巴蒂斯塔，因此也打破了美帝国主义碰不得的欺人的神话。古巴革命的胜利不但鼓舞了拉丁美洲各国人民，而且鼓舞了世界各国人民。
    美帝国主义在拉丁美洲各国筑了一道看不见但是到处可以感觉到的巨大的侵略堤坝，企图阻挡拉丁美洲各国人民革命的洪流。古巴的浪潮突破了美帝国主义的侵略的堤坝，一泻千里，浩浩荡荡，锐不可当。
    当我1958年下半年和1959年上半年访问拉丁美洲的时候，到处可以看到人民革命斗争的浪潮和对美帝国主义的愤怒与仇恨。在里约热内卢我住在瓦加斯大街上，当杜勒斯这个让人唾弃的帝国主义者访问巴西经过这条大街时，没有人欢迎他，等他在美国卫士的保卫下过了这条路，附近的人全出来了，手里拿着扫帚，打扫瓦加斯大街，因为帝国主义者走过的路是肮脏的。我到圣保罗没有几天，恰巧洛克菲勒这位垄断寡头来访了，在一家百货商店里的大楼上挂下了黑旗，为垄断寡头来访致哀。阿根廷的石油在美帝国主义勘探和“资助”的美名下，都变成美国的了，不仅攫取了石油，而且侵占了土地，设立了军事基地。乌拉圭一位著名的教育家怀着极度的愤恨对我说：幸亏乌拉圭没有石油，我们生活得还算平安，不然美帝国主义是不会不垂涎乌拉圭的。巴西的咖啡工人和智利的铜矿工人都告诉我，他们生活在非常富有的咖啡种植园和矿场，但过的是极度贫困的生活。我在智利太平洋沿岸的城市访问时，美帝国主义的海军在智利的海面上演习，企图用武力示威来镇压拉丁美洲各国人民的革命斗争。
    革命斗争是不怕镇压的，越镇压，革命的火焰越旺！
    1959年1月2日，我们在蒙德维地区给一声春雷震醒了：菲德尔·卡斯特罗率领的古巴人民革命武装在昨天进入了哈瓦那，巴蒂斯塔这位从中士爬上独裁宝座的暴君垮台了！从此，拉丁美洲各国人民的革命火焰比过去更加旺盛了。
    革命的火炬只要点着了，就永远不会熄灭。
    为了回答可耻的《圣约瑟宣言》，今年9月2日在哈瓦那举行的古巴人民全国大会上，庄严地通过了《哈瓦那宣言》，正如这个宣言所说的：“以古巴人民的名义，发出体现了拉丁美洲各国人民的希望和决心的呼声”。
    这个宣言不仅是古巴人民革命的宪章，而且是拉丁美洲各国人民革命的宪章。古巴人民革命的胜利和《哈瓦那宣言》是革命的火炬，它照亮了整个古巴的上空，也照亮了拉丁美洲各国人民革命前进的道路。
    古巴是拉丁美洲最后一个摆脱西班牙殖民统治的国家。现在却是第一个摆脱美帝国主义的国家。古巴人民革命的胜利，开辟了拉丁美洲各国人民前进的道路！
    在纪念拉丁美洲各国争取民族独立一百五十周年和庆祝古巴革命胜利二周年的时候，我从书架上取出两个月以前古巴朋友送给我的《哈瓦那宣言》，对它我表示崇高的敬意。在宣言上，我仿佛看到拉丁美洲两亿人民高举着革命的火炬，高歌猛进！
    我深信，一个新的拉丁美洲将在革命的火焰中诞生！
