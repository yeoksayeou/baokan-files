Repair and Manufacture Farm Tools to Welcome Spring Plowing

Advance Repair and Manufacture of Agricultural Machinery and Accessories

The agricultural tool manufacturing and repair units in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are carrying out major repairs and manufacturing of various agricultural machinery and accessories needed for this winter and next spring.

At present, the backbone factories manufacturing agricultural machinery in the autonomous region and the tractor repair and assembly plants in various regions and autonomous prefectures are concentrating materials and processing capacity to rush produce accessories for tractors, machine-drawn farm tools, and semi-mechanized farm tools. The accessories for machine-drawn farm tools manufactured in the fourth quarter alone will be three times more than those manufactured in the first three quarters of this year. The timely supply of maintenance accessories can guarantee that 90% of the tractors currently out of service and damaged machine-drawn farm tools will be put into production before spring plowing.

While stepping up the repair and assembly of agricultural machinery, various farm tool factories are also rushing to manufacture a large number of small farm tools such as hoes, spades, shovels, sickles, and trowels. The autonomous region has specially allocated a batch of steel to strive to produce 500,000 pieces of small farm tools before the end of the year.

Large Numbers of Technicians Go to the Countryside to Repair Farm Tools

The mechanical industry and handicraft departments of Hunan Province are carrying out an agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing campaign. From the beginning of October to November 25, the agricultural machinery repaired in the province accounted for more than 22% of the total that should be repaired; in addition, more than 22.4 million pieces of various small farm tools were repaired, and more than 11.5 million pieces of various small farm tools were manufactured.

At present, more than 5,500 technicians from 114 county-level and above machinery factories in Hunan Province have gone to the countryside to repair agricultural machinery, greatly speeding up the repair progress.

Manufacturing Small Farm Tools Using Local Materials

The Linxian County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Henan Province, in order to prepare for next year's production, recently sent working groups to production teams to conduct a comprehensive survey of the surplus and shortage of small farm tools, and organized forces to repair and manufacture them.

The raw materials for manufacturing and repairing farm tools in this county are mainly obtained locally by mobilizing the masses. The methods are to purchase scrap iron and steel from the masses with cash; clear out waste farm tools and all factories and warehouses in the county; and mobilize workers to vigorously save the consumption of raw materials, etc. At present, the county has manufactured and repaired 1.52 million pieces of small farm tools.

Rushing to Produce Small Farm Tools Needed in Mountainous Areas

From mid-October to late November, the county and commune farm tool factories in Jingxi County, Guangxi, have produced more than 33,600 pieces of small farm tools such as plowshares, hoes, shovels, sickles, and firewood knives needed for spring plowing next year.

Before manufacturing small farm tools, the relevant industrial departments of the county organized working groups to conduct surveys in various types of areas. According to the survey, in addition to continuing to manufacture a batch of double-wheeled double-shared plows, "May 3rd" step plows, and other farm tools for use in relatively flat areas, all farm tool factories in the county generally focused their main efforts on rushing to produce various iron small farm tools suitable for use in mountainous areas.

Establish Farm Tool Archive Management System

In order to strengthen the management of farm tools, each team of the Yangjiazhuang Production Team of the Shizi Commune in Jingchuan County, Gansu, formulated an archive management system through discussions among commune members and established an archive management team. They selected 11 farm tool warehouses in sunny and dry places, numbered each farm tool, registered them in books, and established various management systems for use, receipt, etc.

After the implementation of the farm tool archive management system, the responsibility for farm tool storage is clear, which facilitates timely inspection and maintenance, and also allows for the most economical allocation and use according to the performance and characteristics of various farm tools, thereby greatly improving the utilization rate of farm tools and saving repair costs.

    要闻快报
    修造农具迎春耕
    提前修造农业机具和配件
    新疆维吾尔自治区农具制造和修配单位，大修大造今冬明春需要的各种农业机具和配件。
    目前，自治区制造农业机械的骨干工厂和各专区、自治州的拖拉机修配厂，正集中材料和加工能力，赶制拖拉机、机引农具和半机械化农具的配件。仅第四季度制造的机引农具的配件，就将比今年前三季度制造的多三倍。维修配件的及时供应，可保证现在停车的拖拉机和损坏的机引农具，在春耕以前有90％投入生产。
    在加紧修配农业机具的同时，各农具工厂还正在赶制大批镢、锨、锄、镰、砍土镘等小农具。自治区专门拨出一批钢材，争取年底以前制出小件农具五十万件。
  大批技工下乡修理农具
    湖南省机械工业和手工业部门正在开展一个农业机具修造运动。从10月上旬到11月25日，全省修好的农业机械占应修理总数的22％以上；另外还修好各种小农具二千二百四十多万件，制造各种小型农具一千一百五十多万件。
    目前，湖南全省有一百一十四个县属以上机械厂的五千五百多个技工，下到农村修理农业机具，大大加快了修理进度。
          就地取材制造小农具
    中共河南林县县委为明年生产作好准备，最近派出工作组深入生产队，全面调查小件农具余缺情况，并组织力量修配和制造。
    这个县制造、修配农具的原材料，主要是发动群众就地取材。办法是以现金收买群众的碎铁、碎钢；废旧农具，和全县各厂、各仓库普遍进行清仓；同时发动工人大力节约原材料的消耗等。目前全县已制造、修配小农具一百五十二万件。
          赶制山区所需小农具
    广西靖西县县、社农具厂从10月中旬到11月下旬，已经制出明年春耕需要的犁头、锄头、锹、镰、柴刀等小农具三万三千六百多件。
    在制造小农具以前，这个县的有关工业部门曾组织工作组到各类地区进行调查。根据调查，全县各农具厂除继续制造一批双轮双铧犁、“五三”步犁等农具供应较平坦的地区使用以外，一般都以主要力量赶制适宜山区使用的各种铁质小农具。
    建立农具档案管理制度
    甘肃泾川县什字公社杨家庄生产队各小队为了加强农具管理，通过社员讨论，制订了档案管理制度，并成立档案管理小组。他们选择向阳干燥的地方建立了十一处农具仓库，对所有农具逐件编号，登记入册，建立使用、领取等各种管理制度。
    实行农具档案管理制度以后，农具保管责任分明，能便于及时检查、维修，还可以根据各种农具的性能和特点最经济地调配使用，因而大大提高了农具利用率，节省了修理费用。
