Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Telegram: Shanxi Province is universally carrying out a "small autumn harvest" movement to collect, process, and comprehensively utilize wild plants. As of the first half of November, the province has collected over 1,132,200,000 jin of various wild plant materials and has processed them into more than 400 kinds of products, such as vinegar, wine, oils, soap, lignin, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, aromatic oils, straw ropes, straw bags, and fiberboard.

Prior to the autumn harvest, various parts of Shanxi Province organized technical personnel to survey wild plant resources, summarized the experiences of past "small autumn harvests" and "small summer harvests," and formulated collection and processing plans. In the later stages of the autumn harvest, Party committees at all levels strengthened their leadership over the "small autumn harvest" work. People's communes and production teams rationally arranged labor, determined compensation, and adopted a combination of professional collection and decentralized collection by social forces to mobilize the masses to vigorously collect various wild plants.

While collecting, various localities, making do with whatever was available and utilizing local materials, established processing factories and workshops to promptly process various wild plant materials to increase industrial raw materials and market supply.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei Telegram: Since July, textile industry departments in various parts of Anhui have used cotton stalk bark, wild hemp, Nan She Teng (a type of vine), and other wild miscellaneous fibers to spin yarn or blend with cotton and hemp, producing a total of more than 2,800,000 meters of various industrial fabrics, packaging fabrics, and public fabrics, 298,000 hemp sacks, and more than 200,000 meters of burlap. Many textile factories have also used wild miscellaneous fibers to weave soft, colorful woolen fabrics, jacquard poplin, printed cloth, serge, and other fabrics, which are very popular among consumers.

Anhui Province is rich in wild miscellaneous fiber resources. After investigation and identification, there are more than 250 kinds that can be used as textile raw materials. This year, all parts of the province have formulated plans for utilizing wild miscellaneous fibers, mobilized the masses to collect them, and have collected more than 20,000,000 jin in the small autumn harvest movement, an increase of more than 40% over the same period last year. In addition to establishing degumming workshops (or groups) and actively utilizing wild miscellaneous fibers, textile factories in various parts of the province have also actively helped people's communes establish a number of comprehensive utilization and processing factories (workshops, groups) for wild miscellaneous fibers.

In the work of utilizing wild miscellaneous fibers, various textile factories have adopted methods such as researching, experimenting, producing, and improving simultaneously, effectively solving a series of technical problems such as peeling, degumming, carding, cutting, and so on. According to statistics, various localities have imitated and created more than 1,400 peeling machines, fiber cutting machines, carding machines, separating machines, and degumming machines using waste materials. With the continuous improvement of technical level, the blending ratio and spinning fineness of wild miscellaneous fibers used by various textile factories are also gradually increasing. For example, when cotton and wild miscellaneous fibers are blended, only 25% of wild miscellaneous fibers could be mixed at the beginning, but now it has increased to about 50% to 70%, and the fineness of the yarn has increased from the initial six counts to more than sixteen counts.

    积极采集利用野生植物
    山西采集野生植物原料十一亿多斤，制成四百多种产品
    安徽利用野杂纤维混纺三百多万米布，二十九万多条麻袋
    据新华社太原电　山西省各地普遍开展采集、加工和综合利用野生植物的“小秋收”运动。到11月上半月为止，全省已采集各种野生植物原料十一亿三千二百多万斤，并已加工制成醋、酒、油脂、肥皂、木质素、化肥、农药、芳香油、草绳、草袋、纤维板等四百多种产品。
    在秋收以前，山西省各地就组织技术人员勘查了野生植物资源，总结了过去“小秋收”和
  “小夏收”的经验，订出了采集、加工计划。在秋收后期，各级党委都加强了对“小秋收”工作的领导。各人民公社生产队合理安排劳力，确定报酬，采取专业采集和社会力量分散采集相结合的办法，发动群众大力采集各种野生植物。
    在采集的同时，各地因陋就简，就地取材，建立加工厂坊，将各种野生植物原料及时加工，以增加工业原料和市场货源。
    据新华社合肥电　安徽各地纺织工业部门从7月份以来，利用棉秆皮、野麻、南蛇藤等野杂纤维纺纱，或者与棉、麻混纺，共纺织出各种工业用布、包装用布、公共用布二百八十多万米，麻袋二十九万八千条，麻包布二十多万米。不少纺织厂还用野杂纤维织出了质地柔软、色彩绚丽的纱纺呢、提花府绸、印花布、哔吱等布匹，深受消费者欢迎。
    安徽省野杂纤维资源丰富，经调查鉴定，能够用作纺织原料的有二百五十多种。今年，全省各地都制订了利用野杂纤维规划，发动群众采集，在小秋收运动中已采集二千多万斤，比去年同期增长40％以上。省内各地纺织厂除了建立脱胶车间（或组），积极利用野杂纤维以外，还主动帮助人民公社建立了一批野杂纤维综合利用加工厂（车间、组）。
    在利用野杂纤维的工作中，各纺织厂采取边研究、边试验、边生产、边提高等办法，有效地解决了剥皮、脱胶、弹梳、切断等一系列技术问题。据统计，各地用废旧材料仿制和创制了剥皮机、切纤维机、弹梳机、分离机、脱胶机等一千四百多台。随着技术水平的不断提高，各纺织厂利用野杂纤维的混纺比例与纺纱细度也在逐步提高。如用棉花与野杂纤维混纺，开始时只能掺用野杂纤维25％，现在已增加到50％至70％左右，纱的细度由初期的六支提高到十六支以上。
