Xinhua News Agency, Nanning Telegram: The Anma People's Commune in Yishan County, Guangxi, conscientiously implements the policy of three-level ownership with the production team as the foundation. The commune and production teams actively strengthen and safeguard the basic ownership of the production brigade (basic accounting unit, same below) from both the top and bottom, promoting the development of the commune's economy based on the team.

The Anma Commune attaches great importance to strengthening the basic ownership of production teams and clearly stipulates that the power of production, operation, and management mainly belongs to the production brigade, the basic accounting unit of the commune. The commune mainly focuses on supervision and inspection to ensure the implementation of the production plan. Regarding the production plan, crop arrangement, output targets, and technical measures, the commune adopts the principle of commune suggestions, brigade arrangement, and team organization of commune members for full discussion, so that the commune members are masters of their own affairs. When formulating this year's commune production plan, the commune Party committee, based on the instructions of the county Party committee, put forward the commune's goals for this year's production, and then handed them over to the production brigades and production teams to mobilize the masses to discuss and revise them from the bottom up, and formulate specific production plans and contracted output plans for the production brigades and production teams. Finally, the commune held a three-level cadre meeting to adjust and balance the plans that were too high or too low, and then finalized them. In this way, the plan is based on a more realistic basis, which is both positive and reliable, and improves the brigade's and team's sense of responsibility for completing the plan. Therefore, each production team tries its best to complete the plan and strives to increase production. In the first half of this year, all eight brigades completed their production plans. Of the 108 teams in the commune, 103 teams increased production; only four teams reduced production, and one team maintained the same level of production.

In order to ensure the completion of the production plan, in addition to strengthening supervision and inspection of the work of the production brigades and summarizing the experience of educating cadres, the commune also provides strong support to the production brigades in various aspects. The commune uses part of the public accumulation fund turned in by the brigades to develop the collective economy, and another part is used to support brigade production. Seven of the eight brigades in the commune have received loans from the commune. The factories and experimental farms operated by the commune also mainly serve brigade production. For example, the comprehensive experimental farm mainly cultivates high-yield and high-quality varieties for the brigades, and the farm tool factory repairs and manufactures large and small farm tools for the brigades. Since last year, the commune farm tool factory has repaired and manufactured more than 7,200 farm tools of various types for the brigades.

All production teams in the commune also actively safeguard the basic ownership of the production brigade. The teams, based on the production brigade's implementation of four fixings (land, labor, farm tools, and draught animals) and stipulating that the team, on the premise of ensuring the completion of the contracted output task, has the right to plant according to local conditions, has the right to arrange various farm work, has the right to formulate technical measures, has the right to reclaim sporadic wasteland to implement multiple planting and multiple harvests, and has the right to engage in a small amount of sideline production, are all full of energy and strive to complete and exceed the contracted output plan, and truthfully hand in agricultural products and other operating income within the contracted output task. For example, Changtan Team of Muzhai Brigade, which has poor water conservancy conditions and more cold paddy fields, this year, in order to complete the contracted output plan and the actual output exceeding the contracted output target, the commune members have offered advice one after another. The team summarized the opinions of the masses and decided to vigorously transform the cold paddy fields first. The whole team of semi-labor force started to accumulate temperature-preserving fertilizer, spreading 300 jin of lime per mu, and also putting 30 dan of cow dung and 40 dan of turf ash. Then, taking advantage of the rain, they rushed to harrow the paddy fields and planted early rice in time. As a result, the team's contracted output plan was overfulfilled in the first half of the year. All teams are conscientiously responsible for the agricultural products turned in within the contracted output task. The early rice estimated yield of Muzhai Brigade was originally only 620,000 jin. In order to help the brigade accurately grasp the output and products, all commune members took the initiative to conduct inventory after harvest, and the result was verified to be 720,000 jin.

Under the joint strengthening of the basic ownership of the production brigade by the commune and the teams, all production brigades are determined to become stronger and, under the unified leadership of the commune, in accordance with the policy of "taking grain as the key link and developing in an all-round way," and in accordance with the different conditions of each team, lead the teams to actively develop production according to local conditions. For example, Baitun Brigade has many people and little land, and no wasteland to be reclaimed, so it focuses on grasping the link of increasing the yield per unit area of rice; Suogan Brigade has better conditions for wasteland reclamation, so it combines striving for high and abundant yields with multiple planting and multiple harvests, and has reclaimed more than 1,400 mu of wasteland this year, all planted with corn and other miscellaneous grain crops; Xiaoai Brigade, according to the climate law of more rain in spring and summer and more drought in autumn, tries to plant more summer harvest crops and drought-resistant autumn harvest crops, and at the same time engages in intercropping and intercropping in mountainous areas. Due to adapting to the natural conditions, the yields of crops in various brigades have increased. The major brigades also make full use of the favorable local conditions to plant economic crops such as sugar cane and oil crops, and develop pig raising and other sideline production. For example, Anma Brigade is suitable for planting sugar cane. Last year, it planted more than 1,000 mu, squeezed more than 170,000 jin of sugar, and used sugar cane residue to brew 15,000 jin of wine. Baitun Brigade produces white mud and bamboo, so it uses slack farming to develop stoves and bamboo ware and other sideline production, increasing income.

In the past two years, this commune has correctly implemented the policy of "three-level ownership based on the team" and "unified leadership and hierarchical management," and the whole commune has worked together. The production of the whole commune based on the team has developed in this commune with not so good natural conditions. Now the cultivated land area of the whole commune has increased by more than 3,500 mu compared with before the communization; grain production has increased year by year. Because the economy of the production brigade has developed, the major brigades have submitted public accumulation funds to the commune according to regulations, and the commune has used these accumulations and the accumulation of commune-run enterprises to develop the collective economy.

The continuous development of the brigade-level economy, while deducting a certain proportion of public accumulation, also ensures that the income of commune members increases year by year. Last year, the income of 90% of the commune members in the commune increased, and this number reached 96% in the first half of this year. Almost every household in the commune has savings, with a total savings of more than 34,000 yuan. From last year to October this year, commune members in the commune have built 114 houses themselves.

    安马公社和小队共同巩固生产队的基本所有制
    上下两头加强队有经济
    各生产队在公社统一领导下发愤图强以粮为纲积极发展生产
    新华社南宁电　广西宜山县安马人民公社认真贯彻执行三级所有队为基础的政策，公社和生产小队从上下两个方面积极加强和维护生产大队（基本核算单位，下同）的基本所有制，促进了以队为基础的全社经济的发展。
    安马公社十分重视加强生产队的基本所有制，明确规定生产经营管理的权力，主要归这个公社基本核算单位生产大队，公社主要抓督促检查工作，保证生产计划的执行。公社对于生产计划，作物安排、产量指标和技术措施等，都采取公社建议，大队安排，小队组织社员充分讨论，由社员当家作主的原则来制定。在制定今年公社的生产计划时，公社党委根据县委指示，提出了全社今年生产的奋斗目标，然后交给生产大队和生产小队，自下而上地发动群众讨论修正，并制定出生产大队和生产小队的具体生产计划和包产计划。最后由公社召开三级干部会议，把偏高偏低的计划进行调整、平衡，而后定案。这样，计划就建立在比较符合客观实际的基础上，既积极可靠，又提高了大队和小队对完成计划的责任心。所以各生产队都千方百计地设法完成计划，力争增产。今年上半年，八个大队都完成了生产计划。全公社一百零八个小队，有一百零三个小队增产；只有四个小队减产，一个小队平产。
    为了保证生产计划的完成，公社除了对生产大队的工作加强督促检查、总结经验教育干部外，还从各方面给生产大队以大力支援。这个公社把大队上交的公积金的一部分用来发展社有经济，另一部分即用于支援大队生产。全社八个大队，就有七个大队得到公社的贷款。公社经营的工厂和试验场，也主要为大队生产服务。如综合试验场主要为大队培育高产良种，农具厂为大队修理制造大小农具。去年以来公社农具厂就为大队修造了各种农具七千二百多件。
    全社各生产小队也积极维护生产队的基本所有制。各小队在生产大队对它们实行土地、劳力、农具、耕畜四固定和规定小队在保证完成包产任务的前提下，有权因地种植、有权安排各种农活、有权制定技术措施和有权开垦零星荒地实行多种多收，以及有权经营小量副业等的基础上，都鼓足干劲，力争完成并超过包产计划，如实上交包产任务之内的农产品和其他经营收入。例如木寨大队水利条件差、冷水田较多的长潭小队，今年社员们为了完成包产计划和实产超过包产指标，都纷纷献计，小队综合了群众的意见，决定首先大力改造冷水田。全小队整半劳动力一齐动手大积保温肥，每亩撒石灰三百斤，又放了三十担牛栏肥和四十担草皮灰。接着乘雨抢耙水田，及时种上了早稻。结果上半年超额完成了小队的包产计划。各小队对上交包产任务之内的农产品都认真负责。木寨大队早稻估产原来只有六十二万斤，各小队为了帮助大队准确地掌握产量、产品，在收获后全体社员主动进行清仓盘点，结果核实为七十二万斤。
    在公社、小队共同加强生产大队基本所有制的情况下，各生产大队都发愤图强，在公社统一领导下，根据“以粮为纲，全面发展”的方针，按照各队的不同情况，因地制宜地领导各小队积极发展生产。如白屯大队人多田少，无荒可开，便突出抓住提高水稻单位面积产量这一环；索敢大队开荒条件较好，便把争取高额丰产和多种多收结合起来，今年开荒一千四百多亩，全部种上玉米等杂粮作物；小隘大队根据春夏雨水多，秋季多旱的气候规律，尽量多种夏收作物和耐旱的秋收作物，同时在山地里大搞间种套种。由于适应了自然条件，各大队农作物产量都有了增加。各大队还充分利用本地有利条件，种植甘蔗、油料等经济作物和发展养猪及其它副业生产。如安马大队适宜于种甘蔗，去年就种了一千多亩，榨糖十七万多斤，并利用蔗渣酿酒一万五千斤。白屯大队产白泥和竹子，便利用农闲发展炉灶和竹器等副业生产，增加了收入。
    两年来，这个公社由于正确地贯彻执行了“队为基础三级所有”“统一领导分级管理”的政策，全社上下共同努力，这个自然条件并不好的公社、以队为基础的全社生产都有了发展。现在全公社的耕地面积比公社化以前增加三千五百多亩；粮食产量年年增加。由于生产大队的经济有了发展，各大队按规定向公社提交了公积金，公社运用这些积累和社办企业的积累发展了社有经济。
    生产大队一级经济的不断发展，在扣留一定比例的公共积累的前提下，也保证了社员的收入连年增加。去年全公社90％的社员增加收入，今年上半年增加收入的达到96％。全社差不多户户社员都有存款，存款额共达三万四千多元。从去年到今年10月，全公社社员自己盖了住房一百一十四座。
