Xinhua News Agency, Vladivostok, December 15th: The Soviet ship "Kronshtadt," sailing from Vladivostok to the port of Krasnovodsk, rescued six distressed South Korean fishermen in the Korea Strait. After receiving all necessary supplies, the six men were transported to the port of Busan.

The crew of the "Kronshtadt" discovered a distress signal late at night. The ship changed its course and approached a small boat that had lost control, carrying six fishermen who had run out of food and fresh water. Despite the heavy winds and waves, the Soviet sailors rescued the small boat and towed it to safety.

    苏联轮船拯救六名南朝鲜渔民
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社海参崴15日讯：从海参崴驶往里海港口的苏联轮船“喀琅施塔得号”在朝鲜海峡上拯救了遭难的六名南朝鲜渔民，这六个人得到了一切必需品后已被送到釜山港。
    “喀琅施塔得号”的海员在深夜发现了求救的信号，于是轮船改变了航线，驶近一条小船，这条小船已失去了控制，船上有六个渔民，他们已经没有食品和淡水了。尽管风浪很大，苏联海员还是把小船救上了拖船。
