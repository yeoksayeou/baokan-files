Everyone Has Something to Manage, Everything Is Managed
Hupi Factory Commune Establishes Democratic Management Groups to Fully Utilize the Role of Commune Members

    (Our dispatch) Changchun – The Hupi Factory People's Commune in Yongji County, Jilin Province, has universally established democratic management groups, absorbing poor and lower-middle peasant commune members to participate in management work, becoming an important organizational form for this commune to implement the mass line in various tasks.

    The democratic management groups were established under the circumstances of the commune's increasing consolidation and commune members' increasing awareness. The Third Production Team of the Songshu Management Area of this commune conscientiously implemented the policy of running the commune democratically, frequently mobilizing commune members to participate in business management through forms such as field meetings, symposiums, "Zhuge Liang meetings," and commune member representative meetings. In March of this year, in order to further mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members and better rely on the poor and lower-middle peasant commune member masses, they also established six democratic management groups for production, finance, animal husbandry, tool reform, living welfare, and cultural propaganda. According to the nature of the commune members' work and their specialties, poor and lower-middle peasants were absorbed as members of each group to participate in the production team's management work. The entire team witnessed a situation where "everyone has something to manage, everything is managed, and individuals love the collective." The commune Party committee summarized and promoted the experience of this team, and in the commune's twenty management areas and one hundred and twenty-three production teams, it established seven hundred and thirty-eight democratic management groups, absorbing over 80% of the commune members to participate in management work.

    The democratic management groups are mass management organizations under the leadership of the team committee. The group leader is generally concurrently held by a team committee member elected by the masses, and the deputy group leader is mostly an old commune member or a vigorous young commune member with good political standing, good class background, rich experience, and high enthusiasm, elected by the masses. The democratic management groups all work under the leadership of the team's Party organization and team committee, and according to the resolutions of the commune member representative meeting and the team committee. The production management group assists the team committee in formulating production plans and labor force use plans, and also inspects production progress and crop growth status. The financial management group assists the team committee in formulating financial plans. The animal husbandry management group assists the team committee in formulating livestock and poultry breeding plans and doing a good job in mating, etc. The tool reform group is responsible for researching, improving, and promoting advanced production tools. The living welfare group assists the team committee in running living welfare undertakings well. The cultural propaganda group is responsible for carrying out political propaganda, cultural learning, literacy campaigns, newspaper reading, recreational activities, sports, and other activities.

    Practice over the past six months has proven that democratic management groups are a good organizational form for relying on the poor and lower-middle peasant commune member masses to run the commune well. With this kind of organization, the democratic style of commune work has been better promoted, and the commune's management work has been done more meticulously and solidly. At the beginning of this year, in order to implement the policy of simultaneously pursuing diversification and high yield, the production teams of this commune relied on the democratic management groups to find wasteland and reclaim it, increasing the commune's cultivated land area by more than 1,800 hectares this year. Subsequently, with the participation of the democratic management groups, each production team conducted a meticulous investigation of each plot of cultivated land, concretely implementing crop area, yield targets, and yield increase measures in the fields, making the spring sowing work proceed in an orderly manner. Some production teams also established a field duty system, with one or several members of the democratic management group on duty in the fields every day, in charge of labor attendance, production progress, and labor quality. After taking the above measures, this year the field management work of this commune was done better and more meticulously than in previous years, and crop growth was generally good.

    In terms of finance, animal husbandry, tool reform, living welfare, cultural propaganda, and other tasks, the democratic management groups have also played a positive role. In the past, the material management work in the Sudeng River Management Area of this commune was relatively chaotic. This spring, they absorbed bookkeepers, cashiers, warehouse keepers, and commune members supported by the masses to form a material management group. They conducted a comprehensive inventory of various materials, implemented classified storage by warehouse and classified accounting by variety, and universally established a dedicated responsibility system. From small items such as rope ends and iron nails to large production materials such as carts, horses, plows, and harrows, each user was responsible for their safekeeping, greatly reducing the loss and waste of materials. After the establishment of the democratic management group, the canteens and nurseries in this management area were also run very well. The living welfare group regularly convened meetings to inspect and improve the work of the canteens and nurseries based on the opinions of the masses. This management area also established and improved theoretical learning propaganda networks, newspaper reading networks, cultural education networks, and scientific and technological research networks.

    The establishment of democratic management groups has also played a great role in strengthening commune members' collectivist concepts and raising commune members' socialist awareness. Xu Tingbi, the feeder of the Seventh Production Team of the Sudeng River Management Area, used to only care about labor and was not concerned enough about the affairs of the commune. This spring, after he participated in the financial management group and took on the task of material safekeeping, his ideology of "taking the commune as his home" and "loving the commune as his home" was greatly strengthened, and he took great care of every piece of iron, every piece of wood, every needle, and every thread of the commune. Not a single item he kept was lost or damaged. He took time every day to pick up rope ends, iron nails, and scrap wood in the village. From the beginning of this year to the present, the total value has reached more than 30 yuan. Therefore, he was rated as a red commune member of the commune and a pace-setter of Yongji County. According to statistics, after the establishment of the democratic management groups in the entire commune, due to their good ideology, good labor, good learning, taking the commune as their home, and cherishing public property, the number of people who were rated as "red commune members" has increased from more than 2,700 at the end of last year to more than 3,100 at present. The democratic management groups have also cultivated a large number of cadres. Since the beginning of this year, the Third Production Team of the Songshu Management Area alone has selected six cadres from the members of the democratic management groups, including team leaders, deputy team leaders, group leaders, and warehouse keepers.

    人人有事管  事事有人管
    桦皮厂公社建立民主管理小组充分发挥社员作用
    本报讯　吉林省永吉县桦皮厂人民公社普遍建立民主管理小组，吸收贫农、下中农社员参加管理工作，成为这个公社在各项工作中贯彻群众路线的重要组织形式。
    民主管理小组是在公社日益巩固、社员觉悟日益提高的情况下建立起来的。这个公社的松树管理区第三生产队认真贯彻民主办社的方针，经常通过地头会、座谈会、“诸葛亮会”和社员大会等形式，发动社员参加经营管理。今年3月份，为了进一步调动广大社员的积极性，更好地依靠贫农、下中农社员群众，他们又成立了生产、财务、畜牧、工具改革、生活福利、文化宣传等六个民主管理小组，根据社员的工作性质和特长，吸收贫农、下中农为各个小组的成员，参加生产队的管理工作。全队出现了“人人有事管，事事有人管，个人爱集体”的局面。公社党委总结和推广了这个队的经验，在全公社二十个管理区、一百二十三个生产队中，建立了七百三十八个民主管理小组，吸收了80％以上的社员参加了管理工作。
    民主管理小组是队委会领导下的群众性的管理组织，小组长一般由群众推选出的队委会委员兼任，副组长多半由群众推选的政治好、成份好、经验多、干劲高的老社员或朝气蓬勃的青年社员担任。民主管理小组都在队的党组织和队委会的领导下，根据社员大会和队委会的决议进行工作。生产管理小组协助队委会制定生产规划和劳动力使用计划，并检查生产进度和作物生长状况等工作。财务管理小组协助队委会制定财务计划。畜牧管理小组协助队委会制定畜禽繁殖计划，搞好配种等工作。工具改革小组负责研究、改进和推广先进生产工具。生活福利小组协助队委会办好生活福利事业。文化宣传小组负责开展政治宣传、文化学习、扫盲、读报、文娱、体育等活动。
    半年来的实践证明，民主管理小组是依靠贫农、下中农社员群众办好公社的一种良好组织形式。有了这种组织，更好地发扬了公社工作的民主作风，使公社的管理工作做得更细致、扎实。今年年初，为了贯彻多种多收和高产多收同时并举的方针，这个公社的各个生产队依靠民主管理小组寻找荒地，开垦荒地，使全公社今年的耕地面积扩大一千八百多公顷。接着，各个生产队在民主管理小组的参与下，对每一块耕地进行了细致的调查，把作物面积、产量指标、增产措施具体落实到田，使春播工作进行得井然有序。有些生产队还建立了田间值日制度，每天由一名或数名民主管理小组的成员在田间值日，掌管劳动力出勤情况、生产进度、劳动质量。采取上述措施后，今年这个公社的田间管理工作比往年作得好、作得细，作物生长普遍良好。
    在财务、畜牧、工具改革、生活福利、文化宣传等工作方面，民主管理小组也发挥了积极的作用。这个公社的苏登河管理区过去物资管理工作比较混乱。今年春天，他们吸收记账员、出纳员、保管员和受群众拥护的社员，成立了物资管理小组，对于各种物资进行了全面清点，同时实行分类分库保管，分类分品种立账，并普遍建立了专责制，从绳头、铁钉等小件物资到车、马、犁、耙等大型生产资料，都由每个使用者专责保管，大大减少了物资的散失和浪费现象。建立民主管理小组以后，这个管理区的食堂、托儿所办得也很好，生活福利小组定期召开会议，根据群众意见，检查和改进食堂和托儿所的工作。这个管理区还建立和健全了理论学习宣传网、读报网、文化教育网和科学技术研究网。
    民主管理小组的建立，对于加强社员的集体主义观念，提高社员的社会主义觉悟也起了很大作用。苏登河管理区第七生产队的饲养员徐庭弼，过去只顾劳动，对于社里的事不够关心，今年春天，他参加了财务管理小组，担负物资保管工作以后，“以社为家”、“爱社如家”的思想大大加强，对公社的一铁一木、一针一线都爱护倍至。他保管的物资一件不丢、一件未损。他每天抽暇在村里拣绳头、铁钉、残木，从今年年初积累至今，总价值已达人民币三十余元。因此，被评为公社的红色社员和永吉县的标兵。据统计，全公社在民主管理小组建立以后，由于思想好、劳动好、学习好、以社为家、爱护公物，而被评为“红色社员”的人，已由去年年底的二千七百余名增加到目前的三千一百多名。民主管理小组还培养了大批干部，今年以来仅松树管理区第三生产队，就从民主管理小组成员中选拔了队长、副队长、组长、保管员等干部六名。　（赵玉庆）
