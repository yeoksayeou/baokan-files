Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang Electric Dispatch: North Korean agricultural cooperatives in various northern regions, having achieved a bumper harvest this year, are enthusiastically carrying out a manure collection campaign to strive for an even greater harvest next year. From the autumn of this year until November 20th, the country has already accumulated 17,458,000 tons of fertilizer.

　　North Pyongan Province plans to produce 950,000 tons of grain next year by accumulating more fertilizer and increasing yield per unit area. To this end, the province has invested 30% of its labor force in the manure collection campaign. This includes agricultural cooperative members, workers, and family members of employees. They are highly motivated in accumulating fertilizer, exploring all fertilizer potential.

　　For example, digging peat, dredging ditches, collecting leaves and humus, cleaning livestock pens, and composting. In the last five days alone, more than 165,000 tons of fertilizer have been accumulated, which is 41,200 tons more than the previous five days.

　　"A pile of fertilizer is a pile of rice," and "Strive for increased grain production next year by accumulating more fertilizer," these are the slogans put forward by farmers in South Hamgyong Province during the manure collection. The province made preparations for manure collection in early autumn, and by November 23rd, it had produced more than 2,523,600 tons of high-quality fertilizer. In manure collection, Chongpyong County in this province invested more than 60% of its labor force. They plan to apply more than 50 tons of fertilizer per chongbo (one chongbo equals one hectare) next year. By the 23rd, they had completed 70.9% of this plan. In order to improve acidified land, the county has transported more than 19,000 tons of lime to acidified land.

　　The manure collection upsurges in South Hwanghae Province and South Pyongan Province are also very high. The agricultural cooperative members in these two provinces are determined to increase grain production to 1 million tons next year. To realize this determination, the agricultural cooperative members in South Hwanghae Province have organized youth shock brigades in manure collection, with agricultural cooperatives as units.

　　Jagang Province, Ryanggang Province, and North Hamgyong Province are located in cold regions, and they have also concentrated 30% of their labor force on manure collection.

    决心争取明年更大的丰收
    朝鲜农业社掀起积肥高潮
    新华社平壤电　今年获得农业大丰收的朝鲜北部各地农业社，为了争取明年更大的丰收，正在热火朝天地进行积肥运动。今年秋季以来到11月20日为止，全国已经积肥一千七百四十五万八千吨。
    平安北道计划以多积肥、提高单位面积产量来争取明年生产九十五万吨粮食的指标。全道为此以30％的劳动力投入了积肥运动。其中有农业社社员、工人和职工家属。他们积肥劲头很高，挖掘一切肥料潜力。
    例如挖泥炭、掏水沟、收集树叶和腐土、清理畜圈，以及沤肥等。仅在最近五天就积肥十六万五千多吨，这比前五天多四万一千二百吨。
    “肥堆就是米堆”、“以多积肥来争取明年粮食的增产”，这是咸镜南道农民在积肥中提出的口号。全道在秋初就作好了积肥准备，到11月23日就生产了二百五十二万三千六百多吨优质肥料。这个道的定平郡在积肥中投入了60％以上的劳动力，他们明年要在每町步（每町步合一公顷）施肥五十吨以上，到23日已经完成了这个计划的70.9％。为了改良酸化土地，这个郡已经为酸化的土地运进了一万九千多吨石灰。
    黄海南道、平安南道的积肥热潮也十分高涨。这两个道的农业社社员都决心争取明年把粮食产量提高到一百万吨的水平。黄海南道的农业社社员们为了实现这一决心，在积肥中以农业合作社为单位组织了青年突击队。
    慈江道、两江道和咸镜北道地处严寒地区，他们也集中30％的劳动力积肥。
