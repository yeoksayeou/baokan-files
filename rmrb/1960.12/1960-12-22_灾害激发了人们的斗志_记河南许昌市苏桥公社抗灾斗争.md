    Disaster Stirs People's Fighting Spirit
    ——A Record of the Disaster Resistance Struggle of Suqiao People's Commune, Xuchang City, Henan
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Dai Deyi, Correspondent Yang Guoxun
    Recently, we came to Suqiao People's Commune in Xuchang City, which has suffered severe drought for two consecutive years. As soon as we stepped onto the fields of Suqiao People's Commune, the first thing we saw was a constant stream of carts and wheelbarrows delivering warm seedling fertilizer in the lush green wheat fields. Beside wells and rivers, groups of male and female commune members were installing waterwheels and erecting derricks, preparing to irrigate the overwintering wheat. The people accumulating fertilizer in the villages were working even harder, lifting, pouring, and pressing, with piles of manure of all sizes everywhere. The elderly people who were weaving baskets, mats, and raising chickens, ducks, rabbits, sheep, and pigs in sheltered areas were talking about something with joyful smiles. They are using this soaring enthusiasm and revolutionary optimism to wage a tenacious struggle against the continuous years of drought.
    Salvaging Autumn Grain After Losing Wheat
    Suqiao People's Commune is a region that is “prone to drought if it doesn't rain for ten days, and flooded if there's a heavy rain.” From the summer of last year to the late autumn harvest this year, the sparse rainfall was only one-third of that in normal years. This year's wheat, from sowing last winter to harvest, has been in a state of drought. Under these circumstances, the commune Party committee issued the slogan "Compete with drought for seedlings, seize grain from the tiger's mouth" to the vast number of cadres and the masses. During the wheat's greening, jointing, and grain-filling periods, people used waterwheels and scoops to irrigate the wheat fields. Elderly people and children who did not have water tools also used basins and pots to carry water to irrigate each plant. The more than sixty mu of wheat in the Qianfeng Brigade were located in remote areas with high terrain and a lack of wells. In order to rescue this wheat field, twelve large carts were mobilized to fetch water from a river two li away for irrigation, and more than 150 people used pots and basins to irrigate each plant. After three rounds of struggle against the drought, an average of ninety-seven jin of wheat was harvested per mu. Because the drought was very severe, the average yield of wheat in the commune this year was one-third lower than last year.
    What measures could be taken to compensate for the losses caused by the drought? The commune Party committee invited resourceful old farmers and cadres to gather together to discuss and make decisions. The thousands of ideas everyone offered could be summarized into one: "Salvaging autumn grain after losing wheat."
    If striving for a full stand of seedlings in a year with favorable weather is a meticulous task, then competing with drought for seedlings in a year of severe drought is indeed an arduous struggle. During the anti-drought rush planting of late autumn crops, the six commune Party committee secretaries were stationed to direct the battle. The Tongtang Brigade used waterwheels to draw water from thirty-one row wells into a ditch, and then used a five-li-long branch canal to irrigate 800 mu of land. The Zhangdi Brigade adopted the method of "five dragons converging," allowing water from wells, pits, ponds, canals, and rivers to flow into more than 5,000 mu of uneven sloping land. The Luma Brigade used waterwheels and derricks to inject river water and well water into branch canals, and then formed a flying bucket network, with groups of a hundred people and a hundred buckets converging into one, irrigating 3,500 mu of land. The Suqiao South Village Brigade drained the well water, then dammed the river to intercept the flow. When the river water dried up, they took water from springs in the heart of the river to irrigate the land. At a critical juncture when water was extremely scarce, Wang Hongen, the Party branch secretary of the Wucun Brigade, led the masses to dig ditches and plant seeds along the water flow, and immediately covered the soil to preserve moisture, finally sowing the seeds.
    After the seeds were sown, the corn and soybeans had just sprouted when they were scorched to death by the hot surface soil. What to do? The commune Party committee secretary and the production team cadres consulted with the old farmers again. Based on the old farmers' opinions, the Party committee immediately made a new decision: re-sow with water where the seedlings died completely, and replant missing seedlings or intercrop other crops. Although the results of the second watering, re-sowing, and replanting were again devastated by drought, the number of seedlings in the fields increased. Grasping this fact, the Party committee once again issued a call to the commune members: "Make sure to replenish missing seedlings." Through checking and replenishing, and replenishing and checking, it took more than a month of struggle against the drought to replenish all the seedlings. The 38,900 mu of late autumn grain crops in the entire commune, more than 90% of which were replanted and intercropped multiple times in this way. At harvest time, from a distance, tall corn, low soybeans, and medium-height mung beans grew, forming several floors in one field.
    The More Drought, the More We Plant
    While planting and replenishing late autumn crops, the commune Party committee promptly issued a call to cadres and the masses: "Leave no land uncultivated, seize every opportunity to plant." Commune members immediately reclaimed wasteland and watered and sowed seeds on both sides of roads and rivers, around pits, ponds, and reservoirs. In just one month, they sowed various small grains and melons and vegetables equivalent to more than 11,000 mu. After these crops grew, the commune members said: "A line for going out (pedestrian path), fields everywhere, vines crawling on the village walls, corn growing on both sides of the door." After the autumn, more than 250,000 jin of grain crops were harvested from the 3,800 mu of wasteland. The melons and fruits on more than 7,200 mu of wasteland also achieved relatively good harvests.
    Because Suqiao Commune withstood the drought and planted more late autumn crops, although this year's drought was more severe than last year, the total output and average yield of grain crops for the whole year were still slightly higher than last year. Compared with the year of favorable weather in 1957, the yield of autumn grain crops was still reduced by more than 20%, and some severely affected brigades were reduced by 30% to 40%.
    Striving for a Bumper Harvest Next Year
    When the autumn grain had not yet been fully brought in, the commune Party committee proposed to cadres and the masses the task of planting and managing next year's wheat well, and recovering the part of the harvest lost due to drought this year. While carefully harvesting autumn crops, commune members began to conserve water and prevent drought. Nine dams were built to intercept the four small rivers running through the entire commune, and the completed Xingfu Reservoir and more than 40 pits and ponds were also filled with water. Currently, six brigades, including Suqiao South Village, are continuing to expand irrigation areas.
    In order to strive for a bumper wheat harvest next year, they also prominently seized the key link of applying sufficient base fertilizer and universally applying seedling fertilizer. In addition to organizing professional teams to accumulate, compost, and create fertilizer on a large scale, the entire commune also launched a mass movement for everyone to take action and every household to accumulate fertilizer. Every household has a manure pit and a urine collection device, and everyone has a manure-collecting basket. Production teams use cash or work points to purchase fertilizer accumulated by commune member families, greatly increasing the source of fertilizer. The more than 600 mu of wheat land in the Duzhai Brigade are eight li away from the village and rarely fertilized in the past. This year, under the personal leadership of Liu Wende, the secretary of the commune Party committee, fertilizer was heavily applied directly in the fields to ensure sufficient base fertilizer.
    While striving for high yields, they also used river embankments, roadsides, and the areas around pits and ponds to plant 1,600 mu of wheat, striving to harvest more next year.
    Life is Well Arranged
    We ate at several canteens in Suqiao Commune. Each canteen has a "Five-Day Meal Schedule" posted on the whitewashed walls. From these meal schedules, it can be seen that their lives are well-adjusted, with not only a variety of foods, but also fresh vegetables for every meal.
    Why is life so well-adjusted? Lü Jiangong, the first secretary of the commune Party committee, said: Politics entering the canteen and cadres going to the kitchen are important links in doing a good job in the canteen.
    After the autumn grain was brought in, they planned food rations. Commune members' rations were quantified by person, targets were assigned to households, and savings were kept by themselves. The canteen weighed the grain for each meal, did not eat noodles for lunch in the morning, did not eat tomorrow's grain today, cleared it once a day, and issued a meal schedule every five days, and settled accounts every seven days (commune members' surplus parts, get grain if you want grain, get money if you want money).
    Vigorously grasping vegetable production and storing dried vegetables is the best strategy here for a good life. The harvested autumn vegetables are piled up in cellars, sheds, and next to processing machines.
    In order to ensure that commune members have enough fresh vegetables to eat next spring, they are also trying every means to expand the planting of overwintering vegetables.
    The Victory of the Three Red Banners
    Suqiao Commune has suffered severe drought for two consecutive years, yet production and life are still well-arranged, how can people not be happy. This fact cannot but provoke deep thought in the older generation: In 1942, the same unprecedented drought occurred here. In terms of the severity of the disaster, it only lasted for fifty-three days. However, the drought caused 6,212 of the 7,800 households here to be bankrupt. Only 4,300 people were forced to sell their wives and daughters, and 1,057 people starved to death. We met many commune members. When they talked about their lives today, they said: Every day there is dry, thick, soup, and vegetables, and wages are paid; the wheat seedlings in the fields are growing green and lush. This is the victory of the Communist Party! It is the victory of the three red banners of the People's Commune, the Great Leap Forward, and the General Line!

    灾害激发了人们的斗志
    ——记河南许昌市苏桥公社抗灾斗争
    新华社记者  戴德义  通讯员  杨国勋
    最近，我们来到了连续两年遭受大旱灾的许昌市苏桥人民公社。一踏上苏桥公社的田野，首先看到的是翠绿色的麦田里往来运送暖苗肥的大车、手推车络绎不绝。在井旁、河边，一簇簇的男女社员正在安装水车和架设吊杆，准备给越冬小麦灌盘根水。村子里积肥的人们干得更红火，抬的抬、倒的倒、压的压，到处都堆着大小不一的粪堆。在背风地里编筐、织席和喂养鸡、鸭、兔、羊、猪的老年人，是那样喜笑颜开地在谈论着什么。他们，就是用这种冲天的干劲和革命乐观主义精神，向连年旱灾进行着顽强的斗争。
    麦丢秋捞
    苏桥公社是一个“十天不雨旱成灾，一场大雨水漫天”的易涝怕旱地区。从去年夏季开始到今年晚秋进场，稀稀落落下的一点雨，只有正常年景的三分之一。今年的小麦从去冬播种开始到收获，一直是处在干旱中。在此情况下，公社党委向广大干部和群众发出了“与干旱争苗、向虎口夺粮”的口号。在小麦返青、拔节、灌浆期间，人们车水、戽水浇灌麦田。没有水具的老人和小孩，也用盆盆罐罐端水点浇。前锋大队的六十多亩小麦是处在地势高、又缺少井的边远地上，为了抢救这块麦田，集中了十二辆大车去二里地以外的河里取水灌浇，还有用壶、盆、罐点浇的达一百五十多人。经过同干旱三番五次的争夺，每亩平均收了九十七斤小麦。因为干旱十分严重，全社今年小麦平均单产比去年减收了三分之一。
    用什么办法来补偿因旱减产的损失呢？公社党委请来了多谋善计的老农和干部会聚一堂，共商决策。大家献出来的千条万条计策，归纳起来是一条，这就是：“麦丢秋捞”。
    如果说在风调雨顺年景争取全苗是一件细致工作的话，当此大旱之年，同干旱争苗，的确是一场艰苦的斗争。在抗旱抢种晚秋中，公社六名党委书记分别坐镇指挥作战。同堂大队将三十一眼排子井的水，用水车车往一道沟内，再通过五里长的支渠，浇地八百亩。丈地大队采用“五龙会师”的办法，使井、坑、塘、渠、河的水流进了五千多亩凸凹不平的坡地。禄马大队利用水车、吊杆，把河水、井水注入支渠，再组成飞斗网，百人一组、百斗归一，浇地三千五百亩。苏桥南村大队，井水抽干了，就闸河截流，河水干了，又在河心下泉取水浇地。在滴水奇缺的关头，吴村大队党支部书记王宏恩带领群众开沟顺水点种，种后立即掩土保墒，终于播下了种籽。
    种籽播下后，玉米、黄豆刚刚出芽，就被表面的热土给烤死了。怎么办呢？上自公社党委书记，下至生产小队干部又分头同老农商量。根据老农意见，党委立即作出了新的决定：苗死完的浇水重种，缺苗的补种或混播其他作物。二次浇水重种、补种的结果，虽然又遭到干旱的摧残，但是，地里的苗越来越多。党委抓住这一事实，再一次向社员发出了“缺苗的一定补足”的号召。通过查查补补，补补查查，同干旱争夺了一个多月才把苗补齐。双李大队开始种的四十亩黄豆，连续补了两次，还是保不住全苗，就在缺垅里套种了玉米，玉米补了三次种，仍然缺苗，又在行间里补种了两次绿豆、一次芝麻，最后还是空隙太大，接着又补种两次萝卜。这块地就是这样先后补种了十次、浇水十一遍，才保住了全苗。全社三万八千九百多亩晚秋粮食作物，像这样多次补种、套种的面积占90％以上。收获时，远远望去，高的是玉米、低的是黄豆、不高不低的是绿豆，一块地里长成几层楼。
    越旱越多种
    在种足补满晚秋作物的同时，社党委又及时地向干部和群众发出了“寸荒不留，见缝插针”的号召。社员们立即在路两旁、河两边，坑、塘、水库周围开荒、浇水、撒种，仅仅一个月的时间，就播种各种小杂粮和瓜菜折合一万一千多亩。这些庄稼长起了之后，社员们说：“出门一条线（人行路）、遍地都是田，秧蔓爬到寨墙上，玉米结在门两边。”秋后，种在三千八百亩荒地上的粮食作物，收获了二十五万多斤。七千二百多亩荒地上的瓜果，也获得了较好的收成。
    苏桥公社由于顶住了旱，多种了晚秋作物，虽然今年的旱灾比去年更严重，但是，全年粮食作物总产量和平均单产仍然略高于去年，若与风调雨顺的1957年相比，秋季粮食作物的单产还是减产了二成多，一部分受灾严重的大队减产三到四成。
    争取明年丰收
    当秋粮还没有全部进场时，社党委就向干部和群众提出了种好、管好明年小麦，捞回今年因旱少收部分的任务。在细收、精打秋季作物的同时，社员们就着手蓄水防旱。贯穿全公社的四条小河，筑坝截流有九处，已建成的幸福水库和四十多个坑、塘也蓄满了水。目前，苏桥南村等六个大队还在继续进行扩大灌溉面积的活动。
    为了争取明年小麦大丰收，他们还突出地抓住了施足底肥、普追苗肥这一关键环节。全社除组织专业队大积、大沤、大造肥料外，还开展了人人动手、户户积肥运动。每户都有一个粪坑、一个积尿器具，人人有拾粪篮，生产队用现金或记工分购买社员家庭积肥，大大增加了肥源。杜寨大队的六百多亩麦地离村八里远，过去很少上肥，今年在公社党委书记刘文德的亲自领导下，大搞地头压肥，施足了底肥。
    在争高产的同时，他们还利用河堤、路旁、坑、塘四周种上了一千六百亩小麦，力争明年多收。
    生活安排得好
    我们在苏桥公社好几处食堂吃过饭，每个食堂的粉墙上都公布有“五日饭表”，从这些饭表里可以看出他们的生活调剂得很好，不仅饭食花样多，而且顿顿有鲜菜吃。
    为什么生活调剂的好呢？公社党委第一书记吕建功说：政治进食堂，干部下伙房，是搞好食堂工作的重要一环。
    他们在秋粮进场以后，就有计划地安排口粮。社员口粮以人定量、指标到户、节约归己。食堂用粮顿顿过秤，早晨不吃中午面，今天不吃明天粮，一天一清，五天出一张饭表，七天一兑现（社员节余部分，要粮有粮、要钱有钱）。
    大抓蔬菜生产，大储干菜，是这里搞好生活的上策。已收获的秋菜，在地窖、草棚里、加工机旁堆积着。
    为了保证社员明春有足够的鲜菜吃，他们还千方百计地扩种越冬菜。
    三面红旗的胜利
    苏桥公社遭受连续两年大旱灾，生产、生活依然安排得很好，怎能不令人高兴。这个事实不能不引起老一辈人的深思：1942年，这里同样遭受了空前的大旱灾，论灾情只有五十三天，可是，旱灾使这里的七千八百户人家中的六千二百一十二户倾家荡产，仅被逼卖妻、女的就有四千三百人，活活饿死的有一千零五十七人。我们会见了许多社员，他们一谈到今天的生活就说：每天有干、有稠、有汤、有菜，还发工资；地里麦苗长得绿油油。这是共产党领导的胜利！是人民公社、大跃进、总路线三面红旗的胜利！
