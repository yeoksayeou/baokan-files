Benxi Iron and Steel Company's No. 2 Coking Plant has attached importance to equipment maintenance. From 1958 to the present, the equipment utilization rate has remained above 99%, and major equipment accidents have been basically eliminated. Since the beginning of this year, it has overfulfilled the national plan every month. This fact fully demonstrates that doing a good job in safety production is an important measure to ensure the normal progress of production and its continuous increase.

There are only twenty-odd days left in 1960. The broad masses of workers on the industrial production, transportation, and capital construction fronts are redoubling their efforts to strive for greater production results in this last period of the year. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to do a good job in safety production so that we can most effectively utilize every minute of these twenty-odd days. Now, the north and south of the great rivers have generally entered severe winter. The areas outside the passes have long been covered with ice and snow, and many areas inside the passes have also experienced snow. These changes in weather conditions have brought some unfavorable factors to production. Therefore, it is even more important to pay special attention to grasping the work of safety production. Only by doing this work well can accidents be prevented, creating the most necessary conditions for the continuous rise in production. We must seize the last twenty-odd days of this year and strive to complete and overfulfill this year's plan ahead of schedule, but we must never only focus on catching up with the production progress and relax or ignore safety production work. In that case, not only may we fail to achieve the expected goals, but also bring unnecessary losses to production.

In doing anything, we must "prevent problems before they occur" and fight battles we are sure to win. Chairman Mao mentioned in "On Protracted War" that "foresight enables one to succeed, lack of it makes one fail." The ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Wu also summarized an experience from practice called: "The wise man's consideration must mix benefit and harm." All of this is to say that in doing things, we must consider both the good and bad, the beneficial and the unfavorable, and prevent the occurrence of unfavorable factors as early as possible, and eliminate possible problems before they arise. By doing this, we put ourselves in a completely active "invincible position" and achieve "preparedness averts peril," and "being prepared gives no cause for fear." For industrial production, transportation, and capital construction, doing a good job in safety work can "prevent problems before they occur," and win initiative and time in production.

What aspects should the industrial production, transportation, and capital construction fronts focus on to do a good job in safety work? There are two main aspects: one is to strengthen the maintenance and repair of machinery and equipment, and the other is to do a good job in winter protection against cold, frost, warmth, and fire prevention for equipment and materials. In terms of equipment maintenance and repair, we must first strengthen leadership, carefully inspect process by process, grasp the key points, and solve them ring by ring, striving for solid and thorough results. Chairman Mao said in "Methods of Work of Party Committees": "Only by grasping something tightly and without relaxation can it be grasped. Grasping without tightness is equivalent to not grasping." To grasp safety production well and do a good job in equipment maintenance and repair, we must carefully inspect process by process. Only in this way can we discover weak links, concentrate our strength, solve problems, and do the work solidly.

In order to make safety production work fast and well, different enterprises should determine different priorities according to different production characteristics, establish a practical system of special personnel responsible for specific tasks, and first do a good job in the maintenance and repair of key equipment. For example, in steel plants, it is necessary to protect the furnaces. Each work shift of each furnace must have someone specifically responsible for protecting the furnace, to achieve regular maintenance and timely repair; in coal mining enterprises, it is necessary to pay special attention to safety work in underground ventilation and support protection. There should be dedicated personnel to regularly check the operation of ventilation equipment, ensuring that all pipelines are unobstructed, the underground air volume is sufficient, and eliminating all possible explosions and roof fall accidents. In terms of cold and frost protection, we must continue to conscientiously do a good job in protecting production equipment from cold and frost, and reduce the adverse effects that heavy wind and snow may bring to production to a minimum. Mining, railway, shipping, and all open-air production units, in addition to doing a good job in cold and frost protection for their own enterprises, must also do a good job in cold and warmth protection for the production or transported materials, and ensure that the materials needed by the users can be supplied in a timely manner and meet the usage requirements. For example, coal preparation plants should pay attention to minimizing the moisture content of refined coal and take necessary measures to prevent refined coal from freezing on the vehicles and being unable to be unloaded; the materials transported by trains and ships should be protected and covered according to different needs to avoid deterioration of the materials due to freezing; in forest areas or places where flammable materials are stored, fire prevention work should be done properly.

In addition to doing the above work, we should also organize the timely supply of various necessary materials for equipment maintenance, cold protection, and frost prevention. Such as the supply of spare parts and accessories, the supply of cold protection materials such as straw, lime, and grease, etc.

Although twenty-odd days is not a long time, it is a time that has decisive significance for how much the production and construction tasks for the entire year can be overfulfilled. Every enterprise must conscientiously mobilize the masses and earnestly do this work well to ensure that the last month of this year will be a successful production battle, and greet the new year with even better achievements.

### 一个工序一个工序地检查安全生产

    一个工序一个工序地检查安全生产
    本溪钢铁公司第二焦化厂重视设备维修工作，从1958年到现在，设备利用率一直保持在99％以上，基本上消灭了重大设备事故，今年以来，月月超额完成国家计划。这个事实，充分说明了做好安全生产的工作，是确保生产正常进行，并且持续上升的一个重要措施。
    1960年只剩下最后的二十几天了，工业生产、交通运输和基本建设战线的广大职工，都在加倍努力地力争在这个全年最后一段时间里，夺取更大的生产成果。要达到这个目的，就必须做好安全生产的工作，使我们能最有效地利用这二十几天的每一分钟的时间。现在大河南北已经普遍进入严冬。关外地区早已千里冰封，关内的不少地区，也已经下了雪，天时的这些变化，给生产带来了一些不利的因素。因此，就更要特别注意抓好安全生产的工作。只有做好了这些工作，才能防止事故发生，为生产持续上升，创造好最必要的条件。我们必须抓紧今年最后的这二十多天，力争提前和超额完成今年的计划，但又绝不能只顾赶生产进度，放松或忽视了安全生产工作。那样，不仅可能达不到预期的目的，而且可能给生产带来不应有的损失。
    办任何事情，都要“防患于未然”，打有把握的仗。毛主席在《论持久战》中就提到过，“凡事预则立，不预则废”；我国古代军事家孙武子也从实践中总结了一条经验，叫做：“智者之虑，必杂于利害”。所有这些，都说的是做事情都要考虑到好与坏、有利与不利的两个方面，并且及早地防止不利因素发生作用，把可能产生的问题消灭在它产生之前。做到了这点，就使自己处于完全主动的“不败之地”，做到“有备无患”，“有恃无恐”。对于工业生产、交通运输、基本建设来说，安全工作做好了，就能“防患于未然”，就在生产中赢得了主动，争得了时间。
    当前工业生产、交通运输和基本建设战线应当从哪些方面来做好安全工作呢？主要的有两个方面：一个是要加强机器设备的维护和检修工作，一个是要做好冬季设备和物资的防寒、防冻、保暖和防火工作。在设备维护和检修工作方面，首先应当加强领导，一个工序一个工序地认真检查，抓住重点，一环一环地解决，务求踏实彻底。毛主席在《党委会的工作方法》一文中说过：“什么东西只有抓得很紧，毫不放松，才能抓住。抓而不紧，等于不抓。”要抓好安全生产，做好设备的维护和检修工作，就必须一个工序一个工序地认真检查，只有如此，才能发现薄弱环节，集中力量，解决问题，把工作做得扎扎实实。
    为了使安全生产的工作，做得又快又好，在不同的企业里，应当根据不同的生产特点，确定不同的重点，建立切实可行的专人专责制度，并且首先做好重点设备的维护和检修。比如，在钢铁厂就一定要做好保护炉子的工作。每座炉子的每个作业班，都要有专门负责护炉的人，做到经常维护，及时检修；在煤矿企业里，就一定要特别抓好井下通风和支架掩护等方面的安全工作。要有专人经常检查通风设备的运转情况，做到一切管线畅通无阻，井下风量充足，杜绝一切可能发生的爆炸和冒顶事故。在防寒、防冻方面，就是要继续认真做好生产设备的防寒、防冻工作，把大风雪可能给生产带来的不利影响降低到最低限度。矿山、铁路、轮船和一切露天作业的生产单位，除了应当做好本企业的防寒、防冻工作而外，还要做好生产或运送的物资的防冻保暖工作，要保证使用单位需要的物资，能够得到及时供应，并且合乎使用要求。比如选煤厂就要注意尽量降低精煤的水分，采取必要的措施，防止精煤在车上冻结，卸不下来；火车、轮船运送的物资，就要根据不同需要加以防护掩盖，以免因冰冻而引起物资的变质；在林区或储有易燃物的地方，要妥善地作好防火工作。
    除了做好以上的工作而外，还应当组织好供设备维修、防寒、防冻用的各种必需物资的及时供应。比如备品、配件的供应，稻草、石灰、油脂等防寒物资的供应等等。
    二十几天，时间虽然不长，却是对今年全年生产建设任务能够超额完成多少具有决定意义的时刻，每个企业都必须认真发动群众，切实做好这项工作，确保今年最后的一个月打一个出色的生产仗，用更好的成就来迎接新的一年。
