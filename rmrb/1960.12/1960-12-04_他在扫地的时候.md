    “While He Was Sweeping”
    You Baoquan is a general worker in the office of the mechanical workshop of the Shanghai No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory. A general worker's job is to sweep the floor, wipe the tables, and deliver documents. But he swept the floor out of the office and into the workshop. He arrives every day at five o'clock, takes a rubber hose, and scrubs the oil stains on the floor until they are spotless. He has been sweeping the floor for more than four years, not only sweeping away countless dust and garbage, but also sweeping back a large number of discarded screws. He picked them up one by one, re-aligned the threads one by one, and then handed them over to the warehouse. One day, the coal feeder in the furnace room that supplies steam to all the workshops in the factory broke down. To repair it, one hundred and three screws were needed. They couldn't be found for a while, and buying them would take time. Just as people were anxious, You Baoquan came, holding a large pile of screws in his hand, using his picked-up "waste" to guarantee the urgent need.
    In the workshop, comrades often discovered some good deeds done by someone unknown. When washing their hands after work, a young man casually said, "It's not very clean to wash your hands with soap!" The next day, a bucket of yellow sand and a bucket of sawdust appeared next to the sink. The young people used them to wipe their hands, and their hands were clean, and soap was saved. Every winter, the changing lockers in the workshop, somehow, were moved to the side of the stove, and the clothes the comrades changed into were warm... Who did these things? Who is there, constantly caring for everyone? The truth was finally revealed. Once, when there was a shortage of teacups in the workshop, twenty-seven brand new teacups were suddenly added. While everyone was feeling strange, a comrade discovered You Baoquan selling a large package of cigarette butts at a used goods stall and asked him where he got so many and what he was selling them for. He smiled and said, "I sweep the floor every day, and I always find treasures. There are cigarette butts on the floor and on the tables, which can be used to make pesticides! If there are not enough teacups in the workshop, can't the money from selling them be used for that! Haha..."
    After further inquiry, everyone realized that all these good deeds were done by this old man. Many young people were moved and said, "He is really like our father!"

    “他在扫地的时候”
    尤保全是国营上海第一印染厂机动车间办公室的勤杂工。一个勤杂工，他的职务就是扫地、揩桌子、送文件。可是他扫地就扫出了办公室，扫到车间里去了。每天五点钟就赶来，拿根橡皮管，把地上的油垢冲刷得一干二净。他扫了四年多地，不但扫出去无数灰尘、垃圾，还扫回来一大批废旧螺丝。他把它们一只一只地收起来，一只一只地重新校正螺纹，然后交到仓库去。一天，为全厂所有车间输送蒸汽的炉子间加煤器发生了故障。要修好它，需要一百零三只螺丝，一时找不到，买吧，要耽搁时间。当人们正在焦急的时候，尤保全来了，手里捧了一大堆螺丝，就是用他捡来的“废物”保证了急需。
    在车间里，同志们经常发现一些不知道谁干的好事。下班洗手的时候，有个青年随便讲了那么一句“用肥皂洗手洗不大干净！”第二天，洗手池旁边就出现了一桶黄砂和一桶木屑，青年们拿来一擦手，手上就干净了，而且还节省了肥皂。每逢冬天，车间里的更衣厨，不知怎么的，都移到火炉边上，同志们换上的衣服都是暖烘烘的……这些事情，是谁做的呢？是谁在那里时刻关心着每一个人呢？事情终于揭晓了。有一次，车间里正当缺少茶杯的时候，却突然增添了二十七只崭新的茶杯。大家正在感到奇怪的时候，有一个同志发现尤保全捧了一大包香烟头在旧货摊上卖，就问他哪里来的那么多，卖了干什么？他笑着说：“我每天扫地呀，总是捞到宝贝，地上、桌子上都是香烟头，这都能做农药呀！车间里茶杯不够用，卖来的钱不又可以派用场吗！哈哈……”
    大家再一打听，原来所有这些好事，就是这位老人做的。多少年轻人都感动地说：“他呀，真是像我们的父亲！”
