    Indonesian *Harian Rakjat*
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 19th - The Indonesian Communist Party's newspaper *Harian Rakjat* today published an editorial entitled "Historical Statement and Appeal," pointing out that the statement of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries and the Appeal to the People of the World "have tremendous historical significance."
    *Harian Rakjat* began today to publish the statement of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries in succession. Before this, it had already published the Appeal to the People of the World on December 14.
    The editorial said, "As Comrade Aidit, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party, has correctly assessed, the statement and the Appeal to the People of the World embody democratic discussion and embody the ideological, political, and moral unity of the Communist Parties of various countries. Of course, the imperialists and other reactionaries must be unhappy with this statement and the Appeal to the People of the World, but the working class, working people, and progressive people of various countries will welcome these documents with great joy."
    The editorial pointed out, "The situation must be so because the statement and the Appeal to the People of the World are not only powerful blows to the imperialists and other reactionaries in themselves, but also because they have tremendous mobilizing power, which will further develop the struggle against imperialism and against all reactionaries, including the struggle against the threat of imperialist war, into a struggle of unprecedented scale." The editorial said that for Indonesia, the statement and the Appeal to the People of the World "are an inspiration and stimulus to the struggle to realize the demands of the August 1945 Revolution."
    The editorial further pointed out that the statement and the Appeal to the People of the World scientifically explained the objective situation and the objective requirements put forward by the objective situation in all aspects. "They are a creative Marxist-Leninist summary of the experience of the world working class struggle in the past three years, and they are also a continuation of the creative exposition of Marxism-Leninism by the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries three years ago."
    The editorial refuted the propaganda of the Yugoslav revisionist clique that attempted to belittle the significance of the statement of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries and the Appeal to the People of the World. The editorial said, "This reaction of Yugoslavia only shows that modern revisionists in fact not only never support all progressive and anti-imperialist things, but on the contrary, have always taken a hostile attitude towards them."
  The editorial finally expressed its belief that every revolutionary cadre and activist "will seriously study this statement and the Appeal to the People of the World, and use them as weapons in the struggle against the remnants of imperialism and feudal backwardness, as well as against the threat of imperialist war, in order to achieve the goals of 'three aspects': democratic and complete independence from Sabang to Merauke; a just and prosperous society; and the establishment of friendship and peace with all countries in the world."
    Colombian *Voz de la Democracia*
    Xinhua News Agency, Bogota, December 19th - The Colombian newspaper *Voz de la Democracia* published a commentary on December 16 on the statement of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries, saying that this document powerfully demonstrated the "policy of peace that the entire socialist camp adheres to and defends."
    The commentary said, "While calling on all people to fight for peace, the statement puts forward an urgent need: to realize the task of eliminating colonialism, which still rules in some parts of the earth, and to learn from the example of Cuba to eliminate the political domination and economic exploitation of American imperialism in the Americas."
    "Because peace cannot be consolidated on the basis of some countries ruling other countries and a few people exploiting the majority. The struggle of the people of all countries for national liberation and complete independence is closely linked to the struggle to defend world peace. The struggle of each country to strive for national sovereignty is to defend peaceful coexistence."
    When talking about the strength and unity of the socialist camp, the commentary said that unity and fraternal friendship are embodied in the mutual support between socialist camps and their support for countries like Cuba that are fighting for their independence. The unbreakable fraternal unity of the Communist Parties of various countries is not a dogma or a superficial phenomenon, but an integral part of communist ideology. This unity is also embodied in the support for the struggles of all workers in the world.
    Austrian *Volksstimme*
    Xinhua News Agency, December 16th - Vienna News: The Austrian Communist Party's newspaper *Volksstimme* published an editorial written for *Volksstimme* by Franz Muhri, General Secretary of the Austrian Communist Party, on the statement of the meeting of eighty-one Communist and Workers' Parties.
    The editorial said, "Everyone interested in politics, especially communists, will thoroughly study this statement, because it answers the most pressing major questions of the present era, points out the path to peace, the path to socialism; points out the future of mankind." The statement considers and analyzes all the new phenomena of the present era, and enriches the immortal doctrine of Marxism-Leninism with new and important experiences in a rigorous and scientific working attitude.
    The editorial quoted the statement as saying, “The main feature of our time is that the world socialist system is becoming the decisive factor in the development of human society.”
    The editorial said, "This meeting of Communist Parties of various countries pointed out that although the aggressive nature of imperialist robbers has not changed, 'however, realistic forces have been formed that can smash their aggressive plans.' Of course, all peace-loving forces in the world must unite for this, and work together to strive for real disarmament and peace-keeping steps. The international proletariat will play the greatest role in this struggle. Therefore, the meeting called on the workers of all countries: 'The time has come to confront the forces of war with the powerful will and united action of all teams and organizations of the international proletariat, and to unite all the forces of the international proletariat to prevent war and maintain peace'!"
    The editorial emphasized that "For a long time, our enemies have always hoped that with the rapid growth of communism, the ideological and political unity of communism will not be maintained. They have been disappointed time and time again. And the result of the 1960 Moscow meeting is their recent great disappointment. Through the discussion of all the existing major issues, the unity of the world communist movement has been further consolidated."

    共同行动的准则  加强团结的纲领
    兄弟党报纸评各国共产党和工人党代表会议声明
    印度尼西亚《人民日报》
    新华社雅加达19日电　印度尼西亚共产党机关报《人民日报》今天以《历史性的声明和呼吁》为题发表社论，指出各国共产党和工人党代表会议的声明和告世界人民书“具有巨大的历史重要意义”。
    《人民日报》从今天开始连续登载各国共产党和工人党代表会议的声明。在这以前，它已经在12月14日登载了告世界人民书。
    社论说，“正如印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会主席艾地所正确估价的那样。声明和告世界人民书体现了民主讨论，体现了各国共产党人在思想意识、政治和道义上的团结一致。当然，帝国主义者和其它反动派对于这个声明和告世界人民书肯定感到不高兴，但是各国工人阶级、劳动人民和进步人民一定会以极大的喜悦的心情欢迎这些文件。”
    社论指出，“情况必然是这样，因为声明和告世界人民书不仅本身是对帝国主义者和其它反动派的有力的打击，而且还因为它具有巨大的动员力量，这种力量将使反对帝国主义的斗争、反对一切反动派的斗争，包括反对帝国主义战争威胁的斗争进一步发展成为空前规模的斗争。”社论说，声明和告世界人民书对印度尼西亚来说，“是为争取实现1945年8月革命要求的斗争的鼓舞和刺激力量”。
    社论进一步指出，声明和告世界人民书在各方面科学地说明了客观形势以及客观形势提出的客观要求。“它们是最近三年来世界工人阶级斗争经验的创造性的马克思列宁主义的总结，它们也是社会主义国家的共产党和工人党三年前对马克思列宁主义的创造性阐述的继续。”
    社论驳斥了南斯拉夫修正主义集团力图贬低各国共产党和工人党代表会议声明和告世界人民书的意义的宣传。社论说，“南斯拉夫的这种反应只是说明了现代修正主义者事实上不仅从来不支持一切进步的和反帝国主义的事物，相反对此一贯采取敌视态度”。
  社论最后表示相信每个革命干部和积极分子“将认真学习这个声明和告世界人民书，把它们作为反对帝国主义残余和封建落后以及反对帝国主义战争威胁的斗争武器，以便实现‘三个方面’的目标：从沙璜到马老奇的民主的和完全的独立；一个公正和繁荣的社会；同世界各国建立友谊和和平”。
    哥伦比亚《民主呼声报》
    新华社波哥大19日电　哥伦比亚《民主呼声报》16日就各国共产党和工人党代表会议的声明发表评论说，这个文件有力地表明了整个社会主义阵营“所坚持和保卫的和平政策。”
    评论说，“声明在呼吁所有的人为和平而斗争的同时，提出了一种迫切的需要：实现消灭现在还在地球上的某些地方进行统治的殖民主义的任务，学习古巴的榜样在美洲消除美帝国主义的政治统治和经济剥削。”
    “因为和平不能在一些国家统治另一些国家和少数人剥削多数人的基础上得到巩固。各国人民争取民族解放和完全独立的斗争是和保卫世界和平的斗争密切地联系在一起的、每个国家争取国家主权的斗争就是保卫和平共处。”
    评论在谈到社会主义阵营的强大和团结时说，团结和兄弟般的情谊体现在社会主义阵营之间的互相支援和它们对像古巴这样的为争取自己独立而斗争的国家的支援方面。各国共产党牢不可破的兄弟般的团结并不是一个教条或表面现象，而是共产主义思想不可分割的组成部分。这种团结还体现为对世界上一切劳动者的斗争的支援。
    奥地利《人民之声报》
    据新华社16日讯　维也纳消息：奥地利共产党机关报《人民之声报》发表了奥地利共产党总书记费恩伯就八十一个共产党和工人党代表会议的声明为《人民之声报》写的一篇社论。
    社论说，“一切对政治感兴趣的人，当然特别是共产党人，都将彻底地研究这个声明，因为它回答了现时代最迫切的大问题，指出了通向和平、通向社会主义的道路；指出了人类的未来。”声明考虑和分析了现时代的一切新的现象，以严谨的科学的工作态度用新的重要的经验丰富了不朽的马克思列宁主义的学说。
    社论引用声明的话说，“我们时代的主要特征，是世界社会主义体系正在成为人类社会发展的决定性因素”。
    社论说，“这次各国共产党的会议指出，虽然帝国主义强盗的侵略本性没有改变，‘但是，已经形成了能够粉碎它的侵略计划的现实力量’。当然，全世界一切拥护和平的力量为此必须团结起来，共同努力争取真正作出裁军和保卫和平的步骤。国际无产阶级将在这场斗争中起最大的作用。因此，会议号召各国工人们：“用国际无产阶级一切队伍和组织的强大意志和统一行动来对抗战争势力，团结国际无产阶级的一切力量来防止战争和维护和平的时刻已经到来了’！”
    社论强调说，“长久以来我们的敌人总希望随着共产主义的迅速成长，共产主义在思想和政策方面的统一性将不能保持。他们一次再一次地失望了。而1960年莫斯科会议的结果则是他们最近极大的失望。通过对一切现存的巨大问题的讨论，世界共产主义运动的统一更加巩固了。”
