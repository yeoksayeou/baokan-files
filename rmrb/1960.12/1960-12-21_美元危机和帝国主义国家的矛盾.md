    Dollar Crisis and Contradictions Among Imperialist Countries
    Xi Fang
    The recent dollar crisis not only reflects the inherent economic and political contradictions of the United States, but also exposes the struggle between it and Western European imperialist countries over political and economic interests.
    The dollar's internal value is depreciating daily while its external value remains unchanged, the United States' foreign trade income is decreasing while its overseas aggressive expenditures are increasing, the United States' strength has greatly declined while it still wants to maintain its position of controlling the entire capitalist world. This series of irreconcilable contradictions is finally concentrated in the United States' increasingly serious international balance of payments deficit, the dollar's credit is shaken and a crisis erupts, leading to the rolling outflow of American gold.
    What measures has the United States government taken in the face of this situation? From Eisenhower's emergency instructions issued last month and the steps recently taken by the US government, it can be seen that it is not prepared to resolve any of the fundamental contradictions mentioned above that led to the dollar crisis. Instead, it mainly wants to shift the blame to others, weaken the income of its allies, increase the income of the United States, reduce its own burden, and increase the burden of its allies to solve the problem, which will inevitably aggravate the contradictions between them.
    (1)
    "Buy more American goods" is the first sacrifice the United States wants its allies to make in helping it solve the international payments deficit crisis. In the words of Eisenhower's emergency measures, it is to require other capitalist countries to "lower tariffs, relax quotas, and eliminate trade restrictions that hinder U.S. exports (especially agricultural exports)."
    The struggle between the United States and Western European countries for markets has always been fierce. After the war, in order to resist the invasion of American goods, Western European countries successively raised tariffs and reduced import quotas for American goods, while strengthening their export capabilities to the United States. This gradually improved their trade deficit with the United States. Since last year, Western European countries and Japan have been forced to relax import restrictions on American goods under pressure from the United States, and the United States has implemented a plan to expand exports, resulting in a large increase in U.S. exports to them. In the eight months from January to August this year, U.S. exports to Western Europe increased by 48%. Exports to France increased by 87%, to Italy by 62%, to the United Kingdom by 73%, and to West Germany by 55%. In addition, exports to Japan also increased by 46%. However, the exports of Western European countries and Japan to the United States have generally shrunk due to U.S. trade restrictions and the deterioration of the U.S. economic situation. When the situation has become favorable to the United States again, it has instead raised the issue of these countries further relaxing import quotas for American goods, which is of course difficult for the United States' "allies" to accept.
    However, even though Western European countries and Japan will do their utmost to resist this demand from the United States, Washington is unwilling to give up. Originally, in the past few years, Western European countries and Japan have surpassed the United States in terms of the competitiveness and growth rate of world industrial product exports. In 1958, the total value of U.S. industrial product exports decreased by 9.8%, and in 1959 it decreased by 1.5%. West Germany's industrial product exports increased by 4.1% and 11.6% respectively during the same period, and increased by another 29.5% in the first quarter of this year. France's industrial product exports increased by 6% and 15.4% during the same period, and increased by another 53.7% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period last year. Japan's industrial product exports increased by 20.8% in 1959, and Italy increased by 16.7%. In the first quarter of this year, they increased by another 56.2% compared with the same period last year. ... This situation has made the United States, which is gradually losing the world industrial product export market, jealous. Since the exports of several important industrial products of Western European countries and Japan, such as automobiles, machinery, and electrical machinery, are mainly to the United States, and the quantity of their exports of industrial products to underdeveloped regions is also affected by the amount of foreign exchange earned by these regions by importing raw materials to the United States, the world's largest raw material consumer, at the same time, the enslaving "aid" loans provided by the United States to these countries also enable these countries to increase their foreign exchange to purchase cheap industrial products from Western Europe and Japan. This puts American imperialism in an advantageous position of blackmail when bargaining with Western European countries and Japan: it can use the method of adopting protective tariffs and restricting all imports as a means of threat, and it can use the method of "U.S. aid" to buy American goods to carry out blackmail. Since the foreign trade of Western European countries (especially the United Kingdom) and Japan occupies a pivotal position in the national economic life, this makes it necessary for them to make some concessions when resisting American coercion. However, any concession is far from satisfying the demands of American imperialism, which forms an increasingly sharp struggle.

    In order to solve the dollar crisis, the United States has also adopted a "beggar-thy-neighbor" policy in the financial field. During the gold rush, the United States insisted on maintaining the unreasonable parity between the dollar and gold, while restricting the central banks of other countries from exchanging dollars for gold with the condition of so-called "must be used for proper monetary purposes." This increased people's distrust of the dollar and made American capital flow to Western Europe like a tide. The central banks of Western European countries held more and more dollars. In order to avoid losses, they had to sell dollars in the free gold markets of London and other places and purchase gold. In this case, the United States used pressure to demand that the central banks of Western European countries not sell dollars, and even take out their gold reserves to help it stabilize the gold market. These countries demanded that the United States guarantee their losses, but the United States was unwilling to make such a guarantee, which could not but make the situation worse.
    In addition, the United States also demanded that Western European countries further lower bank interest rates to prevent a large influx of U.S. short-term capital into Western Europe.
    Originally, raising bank interest rates was an important measure for Western European countries to restrict excessive investment, prevent economic expansion, and ensure currency stability. In the United Kingdom, it was also a way to attract foreign short-term capital and prevent the deterioration of the international balance of payments. Since the beginning of this year, the United Kingdom's exports have gradually shrunk, the trade deficit has increased, and the international balance of payments is about to show a deficit of 100 to 200 million pounds. In order to stabilize the international balance of payments, that is, to stabilize the pound, it had to adopt a high interest rate policy to attract foreign short-term capital inflows. This made it the "culprit" of attracting dollar outflows. Unable to stop the outflow of its own funds, and afraid to raise bank interest rates to aggravate the economic crisis, the United States government blamed the high interest rates in Western European countries and repeatedly exerted pressure. However, it was met with a lukewarm response from its allies. In a stalemate that was difficult to get out of, France, due to its poor economic situation and the need to lower interest rates to stimulate investment, was happy to do a favor and first lowered bank interest rates on October 6th. from 4% to 3.5%. The United Kingdom announced that it would lower its interest rate by 0.5%, from 6% to 5.5%, twenty-one days later. After that, under pressure from the United States, it lowered it by another 0.5%. West Germany, on the other hand, only made a gesture on November 10, lowering its bank interest rate by 1%, from 5% to 4%, and stated that this was entirely out of "international considerations." Since these "adjusted" interest rates are still much higher than the 3% interest rate stipulated by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the mouthpiece of the U.S. big monopoly capital, "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, had to admit that the interest rate cuts by the United Kingdom and France and other countries did not help the United States.
    The attitude of Western European countries towards the dollar crisis has always been extremely complicated. On the one hand, they are afraid that the collapse of the dollar will shake the entire capitalist credit system, and on the other hand, they are gloating over the dollar's decline. Because the weakening of the dollar's position is also the relative strengthening of the pound, mark and franc. The recent increase in the gold and foreign exchange of the United Kingdom, France and West Germany due to the dollar crisis is a realistic example. Therefore, when officials of the U.S. Treasury Department were restless and afraid that the gold tide would overwhelm the dollar and had to repeatedly declare that the dollar would never be devalued, the British "Times" ridiculed on November 10: "Everyone, even the U.S. Treasury Department, fully understands that the dollar in 1960 is not the dollar in 1934, just as the pound in 1960 is not the pre-war pound."
    (3)
    Another trick used by the United States government to reduce the international balance of payments deficit is to have Western European countries bear more military spending on its behalf. First of all, a large amount of the United States' military expenses stationed in Western Europe will be transferred to the heads of the United States' "allies." This will not only increase their burden and weaken their power to compete with the United States, but also continue to promote the United States' military aggression plan and control the "free world."
    However, Western European countries have already shouldered a very heavy military burden by following the United States in expanding armaments and preparing for war. In the ten years since the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the United Kingdom's military expenditure has increased from 2 billion US dollars per year to 4.2 billion US dollars per year, and France's has increased from 1.3 billion US dollars to 3.1 billion US dollars. This burden has caused their budgets to continue to show deficits, resulting in serious inflation. West Germany's military expenditure, although considered "too little" by Washington, has also reached about 2.6 billion US dollars. The Western European "allies" provided these "unbearable" "contributions," and the result was only to serve as pawns in the United States' aggressive military plans. This is of course something they are unwilling to do. In recent years, they have been trying to get rid of American military control and would rather develop their own modernized military forces. De Gaulle has publicly said: France must have atomic weapons, "Without this weapon, we can no longer be a sovereign country, but only a unified satellite country." Therefore, in recent years, the United Kingdom and France have spared no expense to establish their own so-called "independent nuclear military force," and West Germany is also vigorously carrying out atomic armament. The United States has long been greatly dissatisfied with the fact that they have spent a lot of money on their own military expenditures, while their "defense contributions" to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are "not energetic" (Associated Press). In particular, the United States is facing increasing economic difficulties, and it is becoming increasingly weak to maintain its large and long overseas military aggression front. Therefore, the United States has been urging its "allies to assume greater responsibilities in the defense of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization," while at the same time proposing various so-called military integration plans, attempting to strengthen its military control over its "allies" and reduce its own burden. This has led to a series of public quarrels between them over the burden of military expenses. And since last year, due to the issue of military integration, conflicts have occurred between the United States and France, and even to a certain extent with the United Kingdom, creating "the deepest rift" within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
    Now that the United States government has sprinkled new salt on this old wound, it cannot but further sharpen the contradictions between it and its Western European "partners." When Anderson and Dillon went to Western Europe recently, they were immediately rebuffed. West Germany refused to agree to the U.S. demand that West Germany pay for the expenses of the U.S. occupation forces on the grounds that it could not increase taxes in an election year, and only agreed to discuss the issue of "sharing" military expenses within the scope of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This statement by West Germany is an attempt to use the strength of other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, especially the United Kingdom and France, to oppose the U.S. demand to increase the military expenditure burden of various countries. The United Kingdom and France are also trying their best to resist the U.S. demands. The United Kingdom pretends to sympathize with the United States' difficulties and supports the United States in demanding occupation fees from West Germany. This is both generosity at the expense of others and an attempt to create a precedent for itself to extort garrison fees from West Germany. France, on the other hand, takes advantage of the United States' predicament to indicate that if the United States wants France to come up with money, it must reorganize the North Atlantic Treaty Organization according to the principles advocated by De Gaulle, that is, to allow France to share the leadership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
    (4)
    In the emergency measures announced by Eisenhower, there is also such an item: "Continue to urgently insist that" the capitalist world
    "Other economically developed countries increase their long-term" financial "aid" "share" to emerging countries." This is to ask the United States' "allies" to come up with more money to support the United States' "aid" plans to underdeveloped countries.
    Why is the United States, which has always regarded "aid" to emerging countries as an important component of its foreign expansionist and aggressive policy, so eager to force its allies to support it in this regard? Originally, today, while Western European economic strength is strengthening, they are all engaged in their own "aid" plans to underdeveloped countries in order to strengthen their capital and commodity exports and compete with the United States for markets. In order to prevent such competition, the United States has been urging these countries to incorporate their "aid" programs into the United States' "aid" program, the purpose of which is still to control. This time, the fact that U.S. "aid" expenses are unfavorable to the U.S. international balance of payments has become increasingly obvious, which makes it even more justified for it to coerce its allies to cooperate with it.
    However, Western European countries and Japan have always been lukewarm towards the United States' "international" "aid" program. The United Kingdom, France, and West Germany have all stated that they have already made great contributions in "aid" to underdeveloped countries, and are unwilling to bear too much of a share. The United Kingdom claims that its "aid" has increased from an average of 50 million pounds per year in the early 1950s to the current 150 million pounds per year. France said that it has its own "Overseas Territories Economic and Social Development Investment Fund" and the so-called "Constantine Plan" to "aid" Algeria, with annual foreign "aid" expenses of more than 500 million US dollars. West Germany's "aid" is said to have increased from nothing to a total of nearly 1.9 billion US dollars. No one is willing to take their own money to serve the interests of the United States. West German newspapers even shouted ambitiously: West Germany "must fill the space created by the failure of colonialism and American aid policies."
    It is precisely because of the fact that imperialist countries are sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams, and each wants to strangle the other, that although imperialist countries have a common interest in "aiding" (that is, controlling) underdeveloped countries in order to save the collapse of the colonial system, various international "aid" organizations advocated by the United States have always been deserted. This is not limited to the "International Development Association" enthusiastically advocated by the United States, but also the so-called "European Economic Cooperation and Development Organization" that was recently signed. Therefore, the U.S. ruling group decided to use pressure. On the 5th of this month, U.S. Secretary of State Herter issued instructions ordering the U.S. "aid" agency, "International Cooperation Administration," to immediately prohibit countries receiving U.S. "aid" from purchasing goods in 18 countries, including the United Kingdom, France, West Germany, and Japan, and Hong Kong with aid funds. This is to give Western European countries and Japan a warning. This action has caused panic in Japan and the United Kingdom, the two countries that are most vulnerable in foreign trade.
    (5)
    The U.S. President's plan to save the dollar is to unload its heavy burdens of commerce, currency, military expenses, and "aid" onto its Western European "partners" and Japan in the simplest way of benefiting itself at the expense of others. However, it must also be mentioned that another extremely important factor contributing to the U.S. international balance of payments deficit is the nearly $4 billion in annual overseas investment by U.S. companies. Regarding this point, the U.S. President has clearly stated in his emergency instructions that in seeking to improve the U.S. international payments deficit, he will never "harm" the U.S. "international economic plan." This means that even though the U.S. ruling authorities are rescuing their own dollar, they are unwilling to shed even a drop of their own blood.
    The United States is not willing to dig its own flesh at all, but instead wants to dig more flesh from others to mend its own sores. This selfish approach is bound to arouse dissatisfaction in other countries. The British "Times" pointed out on November 10: "The weakness of the dollar is entirely caused by capital exports." The newspaper wrote: In the past three years, U.S. "private investment—mostly directed towards Europe—has been averaging $4 billion a year, in addition to (government) spending abroad, and most of the earnings from these investments have been retained and reinvested abroad: one U.S. company alone earned a total of $1.2 billion from its European companies last year and reinvested all of that money."
          × × × ×
    The dollar crisis thus reflects in the most obvious form the thieving partnership between the United States and Western European countries, as well as Japan and other imperialist countries, who are sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams, and each wants to strangle the other. Since the United States, as the largest international exploiter in the capitalist world, has become the center upon which the world's reactionaries depend, its nature determines that it will inevitably refuse to abandon expansion. This means that it will never and cannot automatically free itself from the noose it has created, the huge overseas military and economic expenses. Therefore, it can only alleviate its own burdens in order to overcome the difficulties by sacrificing and weakening its Western European "allies" and Japan. This cannot but intensify the contradictions that have long been brewing within the imperialist camp. It is clear that the infighting between the United States and other imperialist countries will become increasingly acute with the deepening of the capitalist world's economic crisis.

    美元危机和帝国主义国家的矛盾
    希方
    最近爆发的美元危机，不仅反映了美国内在的经济和政治矛盾，而且也暴露了它同西欧帝国主义国家之间在政治和经济利益上的斗争。
    美元对内价格日益贬值而对外价格却保持不变，美国对外贸易收入减少而美国的海外侵略性开支反而在增大，美国实力地位已大大下降而仍要保持它控制整个资本主义世界的地位，这一系列不可调和的矛盾终于集中地反映为美国国际收支逆差一天天严重，美元信用动摇而爆发为危机，导致了美国黄金的滚滚外流。
    美国政府面对这一情况采取了什么措施呢？从艾森豪威尔上月发布的紧急指示和美国政府最近采取的步骤可以看出，它对上面所述的导致美元的根本矛盾一个也不准备解决。而主要是想嫁祸于人，以削弱它的盟国的收入，增加美国的收入，减轻自己的负担，加重它的盟国负担来解决，这就必然加剧它们之间的矛盾。
    （一）
    “多买美国货”，这是美国要它的盟国在帮助它解决国际支付逆差危机中所作的第一个牺牲。用艾森豪威尔的紧急措施中的话说，就是要求其他资本主义国家“降低关税、放宽定额和取消妨碍美国的出口（特别是农产品出口）的贸易限制”。
    美国和西欧各国争夺市场的斗争一向十分激烈。战后西欧国家为了抵御美货的入侵，曾纷纷提高关税、缩小美货入口定额，同时加强对美国出口能力。这样才逐渐改善了它们同美国的贸易逆差情况。去年以来，西欧各国和日本在美国压力下被迫放宽对美货的入口限制，同时美国又实行了扩大出口的计划，美国对它们的出口又有了大的增加。在今年1月到8月的八个月中，美国对西欧的出口额增加了48％。对法国出口增加了87％，对意大利增加了62％，对英国增加了73％，对西德增加了55％，另外对日本也增加了46％。而西欧国家和日本对美国的出口却因为美国的贸易限制和美国经济情况的恶化而呈现了普遍的萎缩。在情况已对美国重新有利的时候，反而提出了要这些国家再放宽美货进口定额的问题，当然是美国的“盟国”所难以接受的。
    不过，尽管西欧国家和日本对美国这一要求将全力抗拒，华盛顿却不肯善罢甘休，原来几年来西欧国家和日本在世界工业品出口竞争能力和增长速度上都压倒了美国。1958年美国工业品出口总值下降9.8％，1959年下降了1.5％，西德的工业品出口却在同时期分别增加了4.1％和11.6％，今年第一季又增加了29.5％；法国的工业品出口在同时期增加了6％和15.4％，今年第一季比去年同期又增加了53.7％。日本工业品出口1959年增加了20.8％，意大利增加16.7％，今年第一季比去年同期又增加了56.2％，……这种情况就使逐渐失掉世界工业品出口市场的美国看得眼红。由于西欧国家和日本的若干重要工业品，如汽车、机件、电器机械等都以对美国输出为大宗，它们向世界不发达地区输出工业品的数量，也是受这些地区向世界最大原料消费国家美国输入原料换取外汇的多少所左右，同时，美国向这些国家提供的奴役性“援助”贷款，也使这些国家可以增加它们的外汇来购买西欧和日本的廉价工业品，这就使美帝国主义在同西欧国家和日本进行贸易讨价还价时居于有利的勒索地位：可以用采用保护关税，限制一切进口的办法作为威胁的手段，可以用美“援”必须买美国货的办法来进行讹诈。由于西欧国家（特别是英国）和日本的对外贸易在国民经济生活中具有举足轻重的重要地位，这就使它们在抗拒美国胁迫的时候，有时也需作出一点让步。但是任何让步也远不能满足美帝国主义的要求，这就形成越来越尖锐的斗争。
    （二）
    美国为了解救美元危机，在金融方面也采取了“以邻为壑”的政策。在挤兑黄金风潮中，美国一方面坚持要维持美元对黄金的不合理平价，而又用所谓“必须用于正当货币目的”的条件来限制其他国家的中央银行以美元兑换黄金。这就增加了人们对美元的不信任，愈加使美国资金势如潮涌地流往西欧，西欧国家的中央银行持有的美元越来越多，它们为避免损失，不得不向伦敦等地的自由黄金市场抛出美元，购进黄金。在这种情况下，美国就使用压力，要求西欧国家的中央银行不要抛售美元，甚至拿出库存黄金，帮助它稳定黄金市场。这些国家要求美国担保它们的损失，但是美国却不愿作出这种保证，这就不能不使情况更形恶化。
    此外，美国还要求西欧国家进一步降低银行利率，以制止美国短期资金大批向西欧流入。
    原来提高银行利率是西欧国家限制过度投资，防止经济膨胀，保证货币稳定的一项重要措施。在英国，它也是吸引外国短期资金，防止国际收支恶化的一种办法。英国今年以来出口逐渐萎缩，贸易逆差增加，国际收支眼看将出现一亿到二亿英镑的逆差，为了稳定国际收支，也就是稳定英镑，它只好采取高利率政策来吸引外国短期资金流入。这就使它成了招致美元外流的“祸首”。在无法制止本国资金外逃，而自己又不敢提高银行利率以加重经济危机的窘迫处境下，美国政府遂迁怒于西欧国家的高利率，一再施用压力。但是却遭到了它的盟国的冷淡反应。在骑虎难下的僵持局面下，法国由于本国经济情况不妙，正需要降低利率来刺激投资，于是乐得顺水人情，首先于10月6日降低了银行利率。从4％降到3.5％。英国则迟了二十一天后才宣布把它的利率降低了0.5％，从6％降到5.5％，以后在美国压力下，又降低了0.5％。而西德则直到11月10日才迟迟作了一个姿态，把它的银行利率下降了1％。由5％降至4％，并且声明这完全是为了出于“国际考虑”。由于这些“调整”后的利率仍然比美国联邦银行规定的利率3％高得多，美国大垄断资本的喉舌《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志只好承认，英法等国的降低利率并帮不了美国的忙。
    西欧国家对美元危机采取的态度一直是抱着极为复杂的心情，一面怕美元垮台，动摇整个资本主义的信用制度，一面又幸灾乐祸，希望美元江河日下。因为美元地位的削弱也正是英镑、马克和法郎地位的相对加强。最近英、法和西德的黄金外汇，因美元危机而大大增加就是现实的例子。因此，当美国财政部的人员坐立不安地生怕黄金潮会冲垮美元而不得不一再声明美元决不贬值的时候，英国《泰晤士报》11月10日却冷言冷语地嘲讽说：“每一个人，哪怕就是美国财政部都十分了解，1960年的美元并不是1934年的美元，这正如1960年的英镑不是战前的英镑一样。
    （三）
    美国政府力求减少国际收支逆差的另一个嫁祸于人的手法是要西欧各国代它多承担军费。首先是把美国一大笔驻扎在西欧的军队的军费转加到美国的“盟国”头上。既加重它们的负担，削弱它们同美国竞争的力量；又能继续推行美国的军事侵略计划，控制“自由世界”。
    但是，西欧各国跟着美国扩军备战已承担了十分沉重的军备负担。在北大西洋集团成立的十年中，英国的军费开支已从每年二十亿美元增加到每年四十二亿美元，法国从十三亿美元增加到三十一亿美元，这种负担曾使它们的预算不断出现赤字，造成了严重的通货膨胀。西德的军事开支尽管被华盛顿认为“太少”，也达到二十六亿美元左右。西欧“盟国”提供了这些“不堪负担”的“贡献”，结果只不过是充当美国侵略性军事计划中的走卒。这当然是它们所不乐意的。近年来它们力图摆脱美国军事上的控制，宁愿发展自己的现代化军备力量。戴高乐就公开说过：法国必须拥有原子武器，“没有这种武器，我们再也不能成为一个主权国，而只是一个统一的卫星国。”因此这几年，英国和法国都不惜工本地要建立自己的所谓“独立的核军事力量”，西德也在大力进行原子武装。美国对于它们各自在自己的军备开支上倾注大量的钱，而对于北大西洋集团的“防务贡献”“不带劲”（美联社），长期以来就大为不满。特别是美国在经济上日见困难，要维持它的摊子大、战线长的海外军事侵略阵线越来越力量不济，因此美国一直敦促它的“盟国一定要在北大西洋公约组织防务方面承担更大的责任”，同时又提出各种各样所谓军事一体化的方案，企图以此加强对“盟国”军事上的控制而又减少自己的负担。这就使它们之间一直在军事费用负担上曾爆发一连串公开的争吵。而去年以来由于军事一体化问题，美国同法国，甚至在一定程度上同英国也发生冲突，造成北大西洋集团内部“最深的裂痕。”
    现在美国政府又在这老伤口上擦上了新盐，就不能不促使它和西欧“伙伴”之间的矛盾进一步尖锐化。安德逊和狄龙最近到西欧去，一开口就碰了一鼻子灰。西德以选举年无法增税为理由，不肯答应美国提出的要西德支付美国占领军费用的要求，而只答应在北大西洋集团范围内讨论“分摊”军费问题。西德的这种表示，是想借北大西洋集团其他成员国，特别是英法的力量来反掉美国加重各国军费负担的要求。对于美国的要求，英法两国也竭力加以抵抗。英国伪装同情美国的困难，并且支持美国向西德索取占领费，这既是慷他人之慨，也是企图为自己向西德勒索驻军费创造先例。法国则利用美国的困境，表示美国如要法国拿出钱来，就得按照戴高乐主张的方针来改组北大西洋集团，也就是说要让法国分享北大西洋集团的领导权。
    （四）
    在艾森豪威尔宣布的紧急措施中，还有这样一项：“继续迫切坚持要求”资本主义世界
  “其他经济上发达的国家增加它们对新兴国家的长期的”财政“援助”的“份额”。这就是要美国的“盟国”多拿出钱来支持美国所控制的“援助”不发达国家的计划。
    一向把对新兴国家的“援助”作为自己对外扩张侵略政策重要组成部分的美国，为什么要迫不及待地强迫它的盟国在这方面给它以支援呢？原来今天在西欧经济实力加强的同时，它们都在搞自己的“援助”不发达国家计划，以便加强自己的资本和商品输出，同美国争夺市场。而美国为了防止这类竞争，一直就在敦促这些国家把它们的“援”外计划纳入美国的
  “援”外计划之中，其目的仍是为了控制。这次美国“援”外费用对美国国际收支不利又已越益明显，这就使它更加有借口来要挟它的盟国来同它合作。
    但是，西欧各国和日本却一直对美国的“国际”“援外”计划不热心。英国、法国和西德都以它们在“援助”不发达国家方面已经出了很大贡献为理由，不愿承担太多的份额。英国就声称它的“援助”已从五十年代初期的每年平均五千万英镑，增加到目前的一年一亿五千万英镑。法国则表示，它设有自己的“海外领地经济及社会发展投资基金”，以及“援助”阿尔及利亚的所谓“君士坦丁计划”，每年对外“援助”费在五亿美元以上。而西德的“援外”，据说也从一无所有增加到总数近十九亿美元。谁也不愿意拿自己的钱去替美国的利益服务。西德的报纸甚至野心勃勃地叫喊：西德“必须补充由于殖民主义政策和美国援助政策的失败而产生的空间”。
    正是帝国主义国家这种同床异梦、各怀鬼胎，所以尽管在挽救殖民体系瓦解方面，帝国主义国家“援助”（也就是控制）不发达国家有着共同利害，可是美国所倡导的各种国际性“援助”机构都一直是冷冷清清，这不仅以美国热心倡导的“国际开发协会”为限，而且连最近签字的所谓“欧洲经济合作和开发组织”也是如此。因此美国统治集团遂决定使用压力。本月5日美国国务卿赫脱发布指示，命令美国的“援外”机构“国际合作署”立刻禁止接受美“援”的国家用援助款项在英、法、西德、日本等十八个国家和香港采购货物。就是要给西欧国家和日本以颜色。这一行动已在日本和英国这两个在对外贸易上最脆弱的国家造成恐慌。
    （五）
    美国总统拯救美元的方案就是这样以对美国说来最简便的损人利己方式，把自己的商业、货币、军费、“援”外等沉重包袱卸到它的西欧“伙伴”和日本头上。但是，还必须提到促成美国国际收支逆差的另一个极重要的因素，一年近四十亿美元的美国公司海外投资。关于这点，美国总统在他的紧急指示中已明白表示：在谋求改善美国的国际支付逆差中，他决不“损害”美国的“国际经济计划”。这就是说，美国统治当局尽管是在抢救自己的美元，却不肯放自己的一点血。
    美国丝毫不肯挖自己的肉，而是要更多挖别人的肉来补自己的疮的自私作法，自然要引起其他国家的不满。英国《泰晤士报》11月10日就指出：“美元的虚弱完完全全是资本输出造成的”。这家报纸写道：美国“除了（在国外的）政府开支以外，美国私人投资——大部分投向欧洲——在过去三年中平均每年以四十亿美元的数量进行着，这些投资所获得的收益绝大部分都保留下来在国外实行再投资：单是一家美国公司去年从它的欧洲公司就赚了总数达十二亿美元的收益，并把这笔钱全部再投了进去”。

    美元危机就这样以最明显不过的形式反映了美国同西欧各国以及日本等帝国主义国家同床异梦、彼此都要扼杀对方的强盗伙伴关系。由于作为资本主义世界最大国际剥削者的美国已成为世界反动派所依赖的中心，它的本性又决定了它必然不肯放弃扩张，这就使它决不会而且也不能把它自己所制造的绞索，庞大的国外军事和经济费用，自动解脱下来，因而也就只能是以牺牲和削弱它的西欧“盟友”和日本来减轻自己的重担，以便度过难关。这就不能不使帝国主义阵营内部长久以来蕴藏的矛盾更加激化。显然美国和其他帝国主义国家之间的互相倾轧势将随着资本主义世界经济危机的加深而日益尖锐起来。
