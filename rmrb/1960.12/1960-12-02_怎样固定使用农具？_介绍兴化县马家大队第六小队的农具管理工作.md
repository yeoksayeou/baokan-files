How to Fix and Use Farm Tools?
    ——Introducing the Farm Tool Management Work of the Sixth Team of Majia Brigade, Xinghua County

Since the Sixth Team of Majia Brigade, Dainan Commune, Xinghua County, fixed the use of farm tools, due to careful management, all farm tools have been properly managed, with accounts for storage, records for requisition, regular maintenance, responsible users, repaired when broken, and replenished when missing, ensuring the needs of agricultural production throughout the year.

The characteristics of the team's farm tool management are "sufficient, good, early, and economical." Sufficient: Only increasing, never decreasing, every piece is usable, whether large or small farm tools such as vehicles, boats, plows, and harrows, not a single piece is missing, and accessories are not lacking. The boat stakes, stern boards, and poles of each boat are neat and tidy, and every part of each foreign cart and foot cart, such as axles, hubs, and cotter pins, is complete and functional. They also used the bonus given by the brigade to add dozens of medium and small farm tools such as wooden plows, springboards, large shovels, drawknives, slag rakes, and masts, and repaired two wooden boats. Good: Both managing repairs, available when needed. The farm tool station is not only a storage room but also a repair shop. They have established a system of minor repairs before and after each season, and a major repair once a year. In the past year, they have repaired more than 500 pieces of various farm tools, fully utilizing the efficiency of farm tools and extending their service life. Early: According to the spirit of "logistics before troops," as early as the fourth quarter of last year, the farm tool station comprehensively overhauled the vehicles, boats, plows, harrows, and harvesting and threshing tools for this year's spring plowing and summer planting, making them a complete set. Before the autumn harvest, they had prepared a complete set of tools for autumn sowing and fertilizer accumulation, and also prepared a mud basket and a pair of straw sandals for each fertilizer accumulation member. Thanks to the sufficient tools, they have timely prepared the base fertilizer for next year's "three wheat" sowing. Economical: Implementing the spirit of focusing on repairs and supplementing with additions, establishing a system of exchanging old farm tools for new ones, repairing if possible, and if not, piecing together or processing and reforming other small farm tools. For example, if the boat pole is broken, it can be turned into a bamboo pole or a mast handle; if the fishing net is broken, it can be cut and reassembled into a fishing net, so that waste and old materials can be fully utilized, greatly saving raw materials.

The reason why the team's farm tool management work is so good is first and foremost that the cadres and the masses have established the idea of managing and using farm tools well. The brigade branch continuously used the method of recalling and accounting to repeatedly explain to cadres and members the benefits of managing and using farm tools well for production, the country, the commune, the production team, and the members. Cadres and members improved their understanding through discussions. The sixth team leader said it well: "Members are soldiers, farm tools are guns, with good soldiers, we must also have good weapons, so that production can win." A new atmosphere of everyone caring for and cherishing farm tools has further formed among the members. Secondly, establishing a democratic management system, fixing special personnel to be responsible for repair and management. The team established a farm tool storage and repair station, led by the deputy team leader, and also specially equipped with a manager and a technician to be responsible for the team's farm tool storage, maintenance, and repair tasks. They also democratically established a management system. It is stipulated that farm tools such as foreign carts, foot carts, and wooden boats are fixed for special personnel to requisition; field tools are requisitioned by special personnel, used centrally, and the requisitioners are responsible for returning them. Over the past year, they have achieved that farm tools are requisitioned according to production needs, uniformly distributed by the team leader; the farm tool station uniformly stores, inspects, repairs, registers accounts and cards, members receive them with a number card, hand them over in complete sets for use, and return them on time as scheduled. The farm tool station has achieved: thorough investigation and registration, clear accounts, and no shortages in storage; timely inspection, complete repairs, and timely submission of plans for adding farm tools. The members have achieved: requisitioning and using farm tools according to the system; timely wiping and returning them. Third, implementing the evaluation, reward, and compensation system. Cadres first take the lead, exemplarily implementing various regulations. For example, when the captain uses the boat, he pays the card as required, and returns it after wiping it clean; last year, an axe was missing, and he voluntarily compensated at the price. At the same time, the team conducts inspections and evaluations every year during the wheat harvest, and those who have made significant achievements in farm tool management and those who have poorly managed, lost, or damaged farm tools for no reason, are given commendations, rewards, or criticisms and compensations respectively, according to the size of the achievement and the seriousness of the circumstances, after democratic evaluation. For example, members who manage windmills can participate in field labor during the gaps in time when they do not affect water management tasks, and can be given additional work points; if they overfulfill the water management task, they will be given additional rewards.

    怎样固定使用农具？
    ——介绍兴化县马家大队第六小队的农具管理工作
    江苏兴化县戴南公社马家大队第六小队固定使用农具以来，由于认真管理，各项农具做到保管有账，领用有据，平时有人保养，使用有人负责，坏了有人修，少了有人添，促保证了全年农业生产的需要。
    这个小队保管农具特点是“足、好、早、省”。足：有增无减，件件能用，不论车船犁耙等大小农具，都一件不少，配件不缺。每条船的船桩、艎板、篙子整整齐齐，每部洋车、脚车的柫、榷、?和销枕等样样俱全，件件管用。他们还用大队给的奖金添置了木犁、跳板、大锹、拉刀、渣扒、船桅等几十件中、小型农具和整修好了二条木船。好：既管修理，随要随有。农具站不但是保管室而且还是修配厂。他们建立了季前季后小整理、一年一次大修理的制度，一年来修理各种农具五百多件。充分发挥了农具使用效率，延长了使用期限。早：根据“兵马未动，粮草先行”的精神，早在去年四季度，农具站就全面检修了今年春耕、夏种的车船犁耙及收割脱粒工具，使之配套成龙。在秋收前已备足了成套的秋播积肥工具，同时还为每个积肥社员准备了一副泥箩和一双草鞋。由于工具备足，及时地为明年“三麦”播种准备好了基肥。省：贯彻整修为主，添制为辅的精神，建立农具以旧换新的制度，能修则修，不能修的拼凑合一或加工改制其他小农具。如船篙断了，就改成篷竹或桅把柄，罱网坏了，就剪下来重新拼凑成罱网，使废物旧料得到充分使用，大大地节省了原材料。
    这个队的农具管理工作做得这样好，首先是干部和群众树立了管好、用好农具的思想。大队支部不断通过回忆算账的方法，在干部、社员中反复说明了管好、用好农具对生产、对国家、对公社、对生产队、对社员的好处。干部、社员通过漫谈讨论，提高了认识。六队队长说得好：“社员是兵，农具是枪炮，有了好兵，还要有好武器，生产才能打胜仗。”在社员中进一步形成了人人关心爱护农具的新风气。其次，建立民主管理制度，固定专人负责修管。小队成立了农具保管修配站，由副小队长负责领导，另外专门配备了一名管理员和一名技工，负责小队农具的保管、保养和修理任务。他们还民主订立了管理制度。规定洋车、脚车、木船等农具，固定专人领用；场头、田头工具，由专人领取，集中使用，领取人负责归还。一年来，他们已做到了农具领用，按生产需要，由小队长统一分配；农具站统一保管、检修、登账记卡片，社员凭牌对号领取，配套点交使用，按期如数归还。农具站做到了：清查登记，账目清楚，保管不少不缺；及时检查，修配成套和及时提出添置农具计划。社员做到了：按制度领取使用农具；及时擦洗归还。第三、贯彻评比奖励和赔偿制度。干部首先以身作则，模范地执行各种规定。如队长用船，照交牌子，用后擦洗干净归还；去年少了一把斧子，主动照价赔偿。同时，小队在每年麦收时，进行检查评比，对保管农具有显著成绩和保管不善、无故散失损失的，按成绩大小和情节轻重，经民主评议，分别给予表扬、奖励或批评、赔偿。例如，保管风车的社员，在不影响管水任务的前提下，利用空隙时间参加田间劳动，可以另外记工分；如超额完成管水任务，另给予奖励。
