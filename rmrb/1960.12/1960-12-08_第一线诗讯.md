First Line Poetry News

The yellow dog barks "Woof woof" at the door,
The village path is bustling with voices,
The production team leader runs out,
Startling chickens to fly over the wall.
The cadre sent to the countryside smiles,
Carrying a backpack, he arrives,
The team leader welcomes him, jumping with joy,
Asking about his hardships and well-being.
"We met in the early days of the land reform,
Shared a shed during the Great Leap Forward,
You come diligently every year, every month,
It's a pity you can't stay for long!"
"I've been longing, waiting to come to the countryside,
Finally today I'm settling down,
A new recruit on the agricultural front,
Determined to learn until my hair turns white!"
Walking and talking, they pass the village entrance,
The yellow dog wags its tail in delight,
The room has long been cleaned,
Put down your backpack, sit down and have some tea.
Putting down the backpack, he can't sit still,
Today I am also a commune member!
He pulls the team leader to walk outside,
To see the fields before drinking tea.
Separated for a few months, feels like years,
The ridges are full of early ploughed winter fields;
Winter ploughing every year, year after year,
This year, seeing it, my heart feels different.
Camellias on the mountains, white as silver,
Seemingly intentionally welcoming him,
Camellias in full bloom seem to say:
"Cadres staying in the countryside for a long time,
Next year will surely be a good harvest!"

Learning from the sun rising, reddening the mountain's back,
Sisters go out early to work together.
Sister Li has just come to the countryside,
Sister Zhang leads the team to start work.
Sister Zhang is strong and sturdy, walking in front,
She carries a scythe and shovel weighing three and a half jin,
Sister Li loves to talk and laugh, walking in the middle,
She competes to carry a hoe weighing two jin.
The sun rises, turning the mountains golden,
The girls laugh and joke as they shovel the field ridges.
Sister Zhang takes the lead and shovels quickly,
The field ridges are repaired as smooth as tofu.
Sister Li learns more and more energetically,
Constantly praising Sister Zhang's skillful work!
Sister Zhang shakes her head and says, "Don't praise me,
It's a pity I only know how to wield this big pen!"
Everyone laughs heartily,
Talking and laughing, they shovel past several ridges.
The sun sets, turning the mountain's back yellow,
The sisters finish work, eat, and chat noisily.
After feeding the children and locking up the chickens,
The sisters come together to study.
A square table, sitting in all directions,
Reading and writing together by lamplight.
Sister Zhang reads the newspaper, thinking about each word,
Sister Li writes quickly with a pen.
Sister Zhang looks up, full of envy:
"Sister Li has read so much, so fortunate!"
Sister Li stops writing and says, "Don't laugh at me,
It's a pity I only know how to wield this small pen!"
The oil lamp's flame is red,
With many people and much work, laughter arises.
"Knowing how to wield the big pen, learn to wield the small pen,
We must train to wield both pens!"
Sister Zhang's suggestion is excellent,
How about signing a "guaranteed teaching and learning" contract?
A white paper is spread on the table,
"For the sake of greatly increasing grain production" is written at the top.
The oil lamp's flame smiles,
The house is more lively than the New Year.

    第一线诗讯
    文莽彦迎门前黄狗叫汪汪，村路上人声闹嚷嚷，生产队跑出来小队长，惊得鸡子飞过墙。下放干部眯眯笑，身背背包走来了，小队长相迎乐得跳，又问辛苦又问好。“土改那年初相见，跃进那年共棚眠，年年月月来得勤，可惜不能住长年！”“长盼短盼把乡下，盼到今天来安家，农业战线当新兵，决心学到头发白！”走走谈谈村头过，黄狗摇尾也作乐，房间早就打扫好，放下背包坐坐把茶喝。放下背包坐不下，我今也是社员啦！拉住队长往外走，看看田里再喝茶。相别几月如几年，满垅提早翻冬田；年年冬耕年年来，今年看的心里异样甜。山山茶花白如银，也像有意来相迎，茶花盛放会说话：“干部下乡长年住，来年定是好收成！”学太阳出山山背红，姐妹们结伙出早工。李妹妹初下农村来，张大姐带队把工开。张大姐身强膀粗走前面，她扛张镰铲三斤半，李妹妹爱说爱笑中间走，她争着背个二斤扁锄头。太阳上山满山金，姑娘们嘻嘻哈哈铲田塍。张大姐领头铲得快，田埂埂修得平似豆腐块。李妹妹越学越来劲，连夸大姐手下工夫做得精！张大姐摇头连说别称赞，“可惜我只会握握这支大笔杆！”说得大家哈哈笑，说说笑笑铲过几个坳。太阳落山山背黄，姐妹们收工吃饭闹嚷嚷。喂好孩子关好鸡，姐妹们结伙来学习。一张方桌四向坐，看书写字共灯火。张大姐看报一字念来一字想，李妹妹挥笔写字嗖嗖响。张大姐抬头一看好羡慕：“李妹妹读的书多真幸福！”李妹妹停笔连说别笑我，可惜我还只会拿这支小笔杆！一盏油灯灯花儿红，人多活多起笑声。“会拿大笔杆，学拿小笔杆，都要练就两手拿笔杆！”张大姐提议提得好，订个“包教保学”合同好不好？一张白纸铺在桌面上，“为了大办粮食”写在头头上。一盏油灯灯花儿笑，房子里比过年还热闹。
