Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 17th: Walter Ulbricht, Chairman of the State Council of the German Democratic Republic, replied to a telegram from Deputy Prime Minister Gizenga of the Republic of the Congo. Gizenga's telegram stated that the Congolese government had decided to temporarily establish its headquarters in Stanleyville and requested that necessary measures be taken to adapt to this new situation.

In his reply, Ulbricht said: "We have noted that the only legitimate government of the Congo recognized by the government of the German Democratic Republic—the Central Government of the Republic of the Congo—has temporarily moved to Stanleyville. In view of the serious threat to Congolese independence, the acts of terror perpetrated by imperialist forces against the legitimate government led by Lumumba, and the forceful prevention of the convocation of a legitimately elected parliament, the German Democratic Republic welcomes the measures taken in the interests of the Congolese people and hopes that you will achieve complete victory in the arduous tasks facing you."

The telegram stated: "We assure you that you can rely on the support of the German Democratic Republic. If you have any specific wishes, please let us know. We will do everything in our power to realize these wishes."

    乌布利希主席复电基赞加副总理
    德意志民主共和国支持刚果合法政府
    新华社柏林17日电　德意志民主共和国国务委员会主席乌布利希对刚果共和国副总理基赞加的电报作了答复。基赞加的电报说，刚果政府决定把它的总部临时设立在斯坦利维尔，并要求作出必要的措施来适应这一新的情况。
    乌布利希在复电中说：“我们已经注意到德意志民主共和国政府所承认的刚果的唯一合法政府——刚果共和国中央政府已临时迁往斯坦利维尔。鉴于刚果独立所遭受的严重威胁，鉴于帝国主义军队对卢蒙巴领导下的合法政府所进行的恐怖威胁行为以及强力阻止合法选举的议会举行会议这样的事实，德意志民主共和国欢迎为了刚果人民的利益所采取的措施，并希望您去完成您所面临的艰巨任务中获得完全的胜利。”
    电报说：“我们向您保证，您可以信赖德意志民主共和国的支持。如果您有任何具体的希望，请告诉我们。我们将尽我们的一切力量来实现这些希望。”
