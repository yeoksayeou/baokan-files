Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, December 8th: The Mongolian newspaper *Truth Daily* published an editorial on December 7th entitled "Important Historical Document of the Current Era," stating that the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries, conducted in a friendly and harmonious atmosphere, clearly demonstrated the further consolidation and unity of Communist and Workers' parties of all countries on the great principles of Marxist-Leninist doctrine.

The editorial stated that the declaration unanimously adopted by the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries is the brilliant culmination of the great activity and collective wisdom of this meeting. Together with the Moscow Declaration and the Peace Manifesto adopted in 1957, this document becomes a manifestation of the unified will of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries. It will further consolidate the unity of the socialist camp, and will further develop the ranks of the international communist movement and the workers' movement on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism.

The editorial stated that in the three years since the first meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties was held in Moscow, tremendous changes have taken place in the world aimed at safeguarding the interests of our socialist camp and the interests of world peace. The change in the position and proportion of the socialist camp in international life is a good concrete proof of this.

The editorial stated that in the current era, the world socialist system is a powerful factor determining the development of human society. In recent years, the strength of socialism has continued to grow, and socialism has gained a newer position, consolidating and developing forward. However, the capitalist world has fallen into a general crisis, its position is disintegrating and weakening, and people's national liberation movements have sprung up everywhere. The colonial slavery system is collapsing in the raging fire of the national liberation movement. These all have great historical significance.

The editorial stated that the declaration, issued in accordance with the great doctrine of Marxism-Leninism and the principles of the Moscow Declaration and the Peace Manifesto, which serve as action guidelines and battle flags for the international communist movement, made a scientific analysis of the important issues of current life and pointed out the strategic tactics of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries under the current conditions.

The editorial stated that the socialist system has now become a powerful force. The Soviet Union is victoriously unfolding communist construction. The people's democratic countries are comprehensively carrying out socialist construction. To further consolidate the unity of our camp is the internationalist obligation of socialist countries. It is necessary for every country in the socialist camp to make full use of the superiority of the great unity of the socialist camp and to further vigorously develop productive forces in accordance with the general economic laws of socialist construction.

The editorial pointed out that as long as imperialism exists, there is a danger of new wars. But at present, when the strength of the great and powerful socialist camp is growing and consolidating, and when the peace-loving policy of this camp is supported by all neutral countries and the progressive humanity of the world, there is a practical possibility of stopping war.

The editorial stated that Marxist-Leninist parties believe that peaceful coexistence is a form of class struggle between socialism and capitalism. Revisionists castrate the main soul of this issue and put forward the formula that violates Marxist-Leninist doctrine that the so-called nature of capitalism has changed and that capitalism can peacefully grow into socialism.

The editorial stated that the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party will take the important historical documents of the current international communist and workers' movement as its guide for future actions and further consolidate its unity with fraternal parties.

The editorial concluded that the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries fully embodies the unbreakable unity of the communists. It is a heavy blow to the imperialists' malicious goals and despicable conspiracies that hope for cracks in the communist movement. It will further consolidate the unity of the powerful socialist camp and the international communist and workers' movement, and further expand the socialist and communist forces in the world. The prospects and goals of the communist and workers' movement are clearer, and we are striding forward to the great victory of socialism and communism.

    当前时代的重要历史文献
    蒙古《真理报》12月7日社论摘要
    新华社乌兰巴托8日电　蒙古《真理报》7日就各国共产党和工人党代表会议发表了题为“当前时代的重要历史文献”的社论说，在友好融洽的气氛中进行的这次各国兄弟共产党和工人党会议，明显地证明了世界各国兄弟共产党和工人党在马克思列宁主义学说的伟大原则基础上的进一步的巩固和团结。
    社论说，各国共产党和工人党代表会议一致通过的声明是这次会议的伟大活动和集体智慧的光辉结晶。这个文献同1957年通过的莫斯科会议宣言和和平宣言一起，成为各国共产党和工人党统一意志的表现，它将进一步巩固社会主义阵营的团结，将在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上更进一步发展国际共产主义运动和工人运动的队伍。
    社论说，各国共产党和工人党第一次在莫斯科举行代表会议以来的三年当中，在世界上发生了旨在维护我们社会主义阵营利益和世界和平利益的巨大变革。社会主义阵营在国际生活中所占的地位和比例发生了变化，就很好地具体证明了这一点。
    社论说，在当前的时代，世界社会主义体系是决定人类社会发展的有力的因素。最近几年来，社会主义力量不断增长，社会主义获得了更加新的地位，并向前巩固和发展。然而，资本主义世界已经陷入总危机，它的地位正在瓦解和削弱，到处掀起了人民的民族解放运动，殖民奴役制度在民族解放运动的熊熊烈火燃烧中正在土崩瓦解。这些都具有伟大的历史意义。
    社论说，按照马克思列宁主义伟大学说和作为国际共产主义运动的行动指南和战斗旗帜的莫斯科宣言、和平宣言的原理而发表的声明，对当前生活的重要问题作了科学的分析，在当前条件下指出了各国共产党和工人党的战略战术。
    社论说，目前社会主义体系已经成为一支强大的力量。苏联胜利地展开共产主义建设。各人民民主国家全面开展社会主义建设。更进一步巩固我们阵营的团结，是社会主义国家的国际主义义务。社会主义阵营中每一个国家都有必要根据社会主义建设的总的经济规律，充分利用社会主义阵营伟大团结的优越性，更进一步有力地发展生产力。
    社论指出，只要帝国主义存在，就有发生新战争的危险。但是在目前，当伟大的、强大的社会主义阵营力量正在增长和巩固的时候，当这个阵营的爱好和平的政策得到一切中立国家和世界进步人类支持的时候，有制止战争的实际可能性。
    社论说，马克思列宁主义政党认为，和平共处是社会主义和资本主义进行阶级斗争的一种形式。修正主义者阉割这一问题的主要灵魂，提出违背马克思列宁主义学说的所谓资本主义的本性已经改变、可以由资本主义和平长入社会主义的公式。
    社论说，蒙古人民革命党将把当前国际共产主义和工人运动的重要历史文献作为自己今后的行动指南，进一步巩固同兄弟党的团结。
    社论最后说，各国共产党和工人党代表会议充分体现了共产主义者的牢不可破的团结，它沉重地打击了希望在共产主义运动中出现裂缝的帝国主义的恶毒目的和可耻的阴谋活动，将进一步巩固强大的社会主义阵营和国际共产主义和工人运动的团结，进一步扩大世界上社会主义和共产主义的力量。共产主义和工人运动的前景和奋斗目标更加清楚了，正向社会主义、共产主义的伟大胜利阔步前进。
