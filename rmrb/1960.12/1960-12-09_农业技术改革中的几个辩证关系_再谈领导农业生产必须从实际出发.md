Several Dialectical Relationships in Agricultural Technology Reform
——Re-discussing the Necessity of Leading Agricultural Production from Reality
Lu Li

Actively carrying out agricultural technology reform is a historical task dictated to us by the reality of agriculture in our country. As everyone knows, our agriculture has just been transformed from a small-scale peasant economy. The productivity of the small-scale peasant economy is low, its production methods are individual and dispersed, and its production scope is narrow. These characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy dictate its backwardness in production technology. Since liberation, especially since the people's commune movement, under the correct leadership of the Party, we have carried out a series of reforms on certain backward aspects of the small-scale peasant economy, thus powerfully promoting the continuous leap forward in agricultural production. However, from the current point of view, we still retain a strong and outdated small-scale peasant economy color in terms of cultivation systems and methods, etc. Certain cultivation methods and systems from the small-scale peasant economy era are combined with today's collective production form, which has become very unsuitable and, to a certain extent, hinders the continued development of productive forces. This is the basic reality of our current agricultural production. Faced with such a reality, what should we do to run agriculture and grain production on a large scale? There is no doubt that we must adhere to reform. All backward things that hinder the continued development of productive forces must be boldly, thoroughly, and resolutely changed. A major change will lead to a major increase in production, a minor change will lead to a minor increase in production, and no change will lead to no increase in production. This is the premise that must be affirmed first. However, it must also be seen that if we do not act according to the circumstances and make arbitrary changes, not only will we fail to achieve the goal of increasing production, but we will also have the opposite effect. Therefore, when we carry out reforms or promote a certain reform, we must be both bold and active, and adapt to local conditions and proceed from reality. That is to say, we must specifically apply the guiding ideology of combining the revolutionary enthusiasm of daring to think and daring to act with the scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts to agricultural technology reform, and use the viewpoints and methods of dialectical materialism to deal with some problems in the reform. More specifically, when carrying out reforms or promoting a certain reform, we should pay attention to handling the following five aspects of mutual unity well.

The Constant Reform Must Be Unified with the Limits of Reform Under Certain Conditions

Reform is endless. It is necessary to change now, and it will be necessary to change in the future. Ten thousand years later, it can be said with certainty that production technology will still develop continuously in the process of continuous reform. Things are constantly developing and changing. What is advanced today may become backward tomorrow, and backward things must be reformed. For example, some places used to broadcast, but now they have been changed to spot sowing. Spot sowing is a step forward compared to broadcasting, but it still cannot meet the current situation, so it needs to be changed again, from spot sowing to row sowing. Row sowing is advanced at the present time, but when there is a better method than row sowing in the future, row sowing will become backward again, and it will be changed to a better sowing method. By constantly changing like this, production can develop continuously. Therefore, leading agricultural production should establish the idea of continuous reform, and do not be satisfied with a little achievement. But on the other hand, any reform has certain limits under certain conditions. Failure to reach this limit will certainly not increase production. Exceeding this limit will also not increase production, and may even reduce production. This is the "reversal of extremes." For example, under certain conditions, transplanting about 40,000 rice seedlings per mu will result in a higher yield than both below and above 40,000 seedlings. Then 40,000 seedlings should be the density limit for rice under these conditions. Not cultivating according to this appropriate density and insisting on the old method of "sparse grain and large ears," appreciating the old method of 20,000 or 30,000 seedlings, is a manifestation of conservative thinking, which must be opposed. But if it is believed that 40,000 seedlings produce a higher yield than 20,000 or 30,000 seedlings, and therefore the conclusion is drawn: the yield of 50,000 or 60,000 seedlings must be higher, "the denser the better," this conclusion is unreliable. A miss is as good as a mile. Objective conditions only allow for 40,000 seedlings to be planted per mu. Exceeding this limit and forcing 50,000 or 60,000 seedlings will violate the laws of objective things. As a result, the yield will not only not be higher than 40,000 seedlings, but may even not be as high as the original yield.

We advocate that the preparation work for production should be "as early as possible," and the actual action should be "appropriately earlier." This method was, is, and will be the truth in the future. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Do not fight unprepared battles." Where does the certainty come from? It comes from doing a good job of preparation beforehand. Prepare for spring sowing in the winter slack season, and prepare for summer sowing at the same time as spring sowing. When spring and summer sowing really arrive, "everything is ready," and you can strive for the initiative. Only when the preparation work is grasped early can the actual sowing be done "appropriately earlier." "Appropriately earlier" is a requirement of the growth law of the crops themselves, and it is also an important way to stagger the workload, ease the contradiction of labor tension, and seize the season. Because the current agricultural production in our country mainly relies on manual operation, and the work efficiency is not very high, if we only talk about "appropriate timing" without talking about "appropriately earlier," the result must be that some is timely and some is not, affecting the increase in production; if we do it according to "appropriately earlier," the result may be that a small part is slightly earlier, and most of it is just right. Not being early when it should be early is also a manifestation of conservative thinking, which must be opposed; but if it is believed that earlier is better than later, and therefore the conclusion is drawn: "the earlier the better," planting rice seedlings at the Awakening of Insects and sowing wheat at the Beginning of Autumn, will this work? Certainly not. Any crop needs suitable climatic conditions to sprout and grow when planted, otherwise it will not sprout and grow. Solar terms and temperature are the basic limits that determine when various crops are sown. It is completely correct and necessary to be appropriately earlier within this limit. Exceeding this limit and inappropriately advancing further will definitely cause losses of rotten seedlings and rotten seeds.

One step beyond the truth is fallacy. Dialectical materialists require themselves to see both the constantly changing side of things and the relatively static side when looking at problems, and to recognize both subjective initiative and objective regularity. People understand objective regularity and act according to objective law, then there is maximum "freedom"; therefore, Engels said that this is moving from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom. The so-called exceeding the limits permitted by objective things will be too much and as bad as too little, and the extreme will turn into the opposite. This does not mean denying the variability of objective things. If the variability of things is denied and "density limits," "fertilization limits," etc. are specified, that is unfounded. The problem is that before objective things have changed significantly, people can only exert subjective initiative to promote changes in objective things, create conditions for continuous reform, and at the same time strictly abide by the limits under certain conditions, and unify continuous reform with the limits of reform under certain conditions, so as not to run into snags.

          A Certain Reform Must Be Unified With Various Reforms Around It

No thing exists in isolation. The relationship between one thing and other things around it is mutually contradictory, mutually related, mutually restrictive, and mutually dependent. Agricultural technology reform is also like this. A certain reform is closely related to various reforms around it. That is to say, whether a reform can succeed depends not only on whether the conditions for the reform itself are mature, but also on whether it is compatible with various reforms around it. Sometimes, a certain reform is correct and should indeed be changed, but if various other reforms do not follow up accordingly, and this reform is carried out in isolation, it will not receive the due effect. Taking dense planting as an example, how "dense" is reasonable for this plot of land? To solve this problem, we cannot just discuss dense planting on its own. We must comprehensively study what soil color this plot of land is, how many inches deep it is ploughed, how much fertilizer is applied, and how reforms in water conservancy conditions are carried out. If the reforms in various aspects are well coordinated, the density can be appropriately increased. If the conditions in various aspects are not good, then we cannot blindly pursue density. Because the measure of changing sparse planting to dense planting can only give full play to its role and achieve the goal of increasing production when it is closely combined with comprehensive technical reforms such as changing shallow plowing to deep plowing, changing dry land to paddy field (irrigated land), and changing less fertilization to more fertilization. Otherwise, only changing sparse planting to dense planting, while other reforms lag far behind the requirements of dense planting for them, will make dense planting useless. The view that blindly believing that increasing the amount of seeds sown by a certain amount will definitely increase the yield by a certain amount is a metaphysical point of view. If seeds are planted on shallowly ploughed land without fertilizer, no matter how dense you plant, you will definitely not have a good harvest. The yield of crops is the result of the addition of seeds, land, fertilizer, water, sunlight and other conditions, "connecting causes and complementing each other," and overcoming disasters. That is to say, changing sparse planting to dense planting is a good experience, but if it is separated from the conditions it requires, or if these conditions are not fully mature and dense planting is blindly carried out, it will not achieve the expected results. Changing shoulder carrying to carts to achieve "cartization" is also like this. To achieve "cartization," the focus is of course on grasping the construction of carts. Without carts, there is no point in talking about "cartization." This is a very simple principle. But if there are only carts, can carts be used immediately for sending fertilizer and transporting rice? Can it be considered that "cartization" has been achieved? We cannot look at the problem so simply. Carts have to run on roads. If there are carts but no roads or the roads are very small, the carts cannot run, and it still cannot be "cartized." Therefore, to change shoulder carrying to carts, we must also change small roads to large roads at the same time. Only when a large number of carts and a network of large roads are closely combined, and the main transportation uses carts, can we truly achieve "cartization." Of course, it is not impossible to build roads after having carts. The problem is that some places can be built, and some places cannot be built (such as some mountainous areas and sandy areas). For places where roads cannot be built or cannot be built temporarily, if the problem of "roads" is not solved first, but carts are blindly built, the result can only be wasteful and useless to production. As the saying goes: red flowers also need green leaves. Any beautiful reform, if separated from the cooperation of various reforms that are adapted to it, will become something incomprehensible.

Bold Changes Must Be Unified With Changes Adapted to Local Conditions

When carrying out agricultural technology reform or promoting reform, on the one hand, for those things that should be changed and must be changed, we must change boldly and resolutely. On the other hand, we must adhere to adapting to local conditions and proceed from reality. For certain reforms that are temporarily not in line with the then and there objective conditions, we must resolutely not change or change slowly, and we cannot be uniform and mechanically imitate. Objective conditions vary greatly. Certain reforms that can be implemented in this place may not be able to be implemented in that place. What may be a good experience here may not be a good experience there. Forcing reforms that are not suitable for local conditions will only lead to bad results. For example, row sowing. A large number of facts have proved that row sowing is an advanced sowing method, with higher yields and less labor than broadcasting and spot sowing. But does this mean that row sowing is absolutely good, and can row sowing be done anywhere? Not necessarily. In some mountainous areas with steep slopes, the row seeder cannot be placed stably at all. If row sowing is forced, it will be sown like a chicken scratching, which is not as good as spot sowing or broadcasting. Obviously, such land is not suitable for row sowing. Some plots are very small, and the row seeder cannot turn around when it goes down. More seeds are scattered than sown, and some areas are dense and some are sparse. Obviously, such land is also not suitable for row sowing. Also, some land, due to the influence of previous crops or natural conditions, cannot be leveled and crushed all at once. When the row seeder goes down, it is like dancing, jumping around, and sowing in a mess. Obviously, such land is also not suitable for row sowing. It is completely wrong not to admit that row sowing is indeed better than spot sowing or broadcasting, not to actively promote row sowing, or not to create conditions for promoting row sowing, and even to fundamentally deny row sowing; but on the other hand, it is also wrong not to admit that in some places or plots, because of the different specific situations, it is indeed not suitable for row sowing temporarily. Marxism tells us that there is only concrete truth, no abstract truth; everything must be transferred according to time, place, and conditions. In all places or plots where the conditions for row sowing are met, the use of row sowing will lead to good results. In all places or plots where the conditions for row sowing are not yet met, the use of row sowing will lead to bad results. Of course, the so-called conditions for row sowing can also be changed or created. For example, some plots are very small. According to the situation, small plots can be merged into large plots to make them suitable for row sowing. Like this, it is completely necessary and appropriate to spend a certain cost to create conditions for promoting row sowing. The problem is that some conditions can be changed now, some conditions cannot be changed temporarily, some conditions are cost-effective to change with a certain cost, some conditions are not cost-effective to change, and some conditions cannot be changed at all under the current situation (such as changing sloping land to flat land), nor is it necessary to change. The method of promoting row sowing should be adapted to local conditions and proceed from reality. The conditions for creating a method of row sowing should also be adapted to local conditions and proceed from reality, and should not be done blindly. For a region and a plot of land, whether it is good to change to row sowing or not depends on the specific situation at that time and place, and depends on whether the purpose of high yield and labor saving can be achieved after row sowing is changed. We must comprehensively weigh the advantages and disadvantages, and cannot only proceed from subjective wishes, and prescribe a model to mechanically apply to the different objective situations, such as requiring "uniform row sowing," etc. Changing from spot sowing or broadcasting to row sowing is like this, and other technical reforms are also like this: we must adhere to bold changes and adhere to changes adapted to local conditions. Only by closely unifying the two can good reforms have good results.

          Reform Must Be Unified With Inheritance

We are historical materialists, and we cannot look at problems in isolation from history. Some things were advanced under past historical conditions, but are backward under today's historical conditions—similar things, no matter how advanced they were in the past, as long as they are now backward, must be resolutely reformed; and some things, from a developmental point of view, may be backward under future historical conditions, but have not yet completed their historical mission, and are therefore still applicable (some things may also be applicable in the future)—similar things must be inherited without hesitation and cannot be discarded casually. The production methods of the small-scale peasant economy, like any other thing, are a unity of contradictions, with both a backward side and an applicable side. It is wrong to affirm everything about it, and it is also wrong to deny everything about it. The correct attitude should be to treat them differently: the backward side must be resolutely reformed, and the applicable side must be inherited. The relationship between reform and inheritance, in terms of production technology, should be inheritance first. On the basis of inheritance, we should then conduct investigation and research on the old production methods, classify them, and reform them in a planned and step-by-step manner. In this way, we can at least achieve first ensuring production, and then striving for increased production, so as not to reduce production due to rash reform. To reform and inherit, an important issue is to solve the ideological understanding of the people, that is, not only to see the important significance of reforming backward production methods, but also to see the important significance of inheriting the experience of predecessors. Our ancestors have dealt with nature for thousands of years and have accumulated considerable experience. Inheriting this experience and applying it to production is of great benefit to our socialist construction and is an indispensable important force in our construction cause. Is there anything worth inheriting in the experience of our predecessors? The answer is yes. For example, in terms of the sowing period, Hubei Province has summarized: "Poor people should not listen to the rich people's coaxing, the flowering of the Chinese tallow tree (around Qingming) is the time to sow"; "Before Qingming, it is good to plant cotton, rice seedlings at Qingming are most stable," etc. In terms of sowing quality and methods, predecessors have summarized: "Deep plowing plus one inch is equivalent to one additional application of fertilizer"; "People are afraid of being thin in the womb, and seedlings are afraid of roots not being fertile"; "A thousand plows and ten thousand harrows are not as good as planting one night early"; "Cultivating land without ditching is equivalent to thieves stealing"; "Good gourds saw good ladles, good grain seeds grow good seedlings"; "Dig deep, cover thinly, the knots (corn) are like ox horns"; "To get the corn to knot, unless the leaves touch each other" (dense planting), etc. In terms of field management, predecessors have summarized: "Wheat weeding three times has surplus grain, others have wasteland but I don't have wasteland"; "Corn sees iron (hoe), it grows one node every night"; "Cotton weeding seven times is as white as silver, grain stepping three times (shaking grass) pigs have no chaff"; "Eat more and have fewer meals, top dressing is like whipping"; "Wheat ripens when the fire burns, grain ripens when the water is poured," etc. In terms of rushing to harvest, predecessors have summarized: "Nine percent open sickles, ten percent return to the warehouse"; "Ten percent harvest, three percent is lost," etc. Predecessors not only summarized their own correct experience for us, but also summarized the mistakes they had made and the problems they had encountered, educating future generations to learn lessons. Such as "Many seedlings are like many weeds, lack of seedlings is like lack of treasures"; "Rather lose seedlings than worry about seedlings"; "No cotton is planted after the Grain in Ear, no fields are planted after the Summer Solstice"; "Buckwheat planted late is hit by frost"; "No barley is planted after the Heavy Snow, no wheat is planted after the Light Snow," etc. Under the current conditions, are these things summarized by our predecessors applicable in many places? Experience in recent years has proved that they are applicable. Taking the sowing period summarized by our predecessors as an example, from many places in Hubei Province, cold waves frequently hit before Qingming, which is almost an annual rule. In these places, if we do not carefully consider these experiences of our predecessors and sow too early, it is very dangerous, and sowing too late also has great disadvantages. These experiences and lessons left by our predecessors are an extremely valuable asset. As long as there is a little merit, it must be inherited and used for production and construction. We communists not only do not reject the good experiences inherent in our country, but on the contrary, only we are truly loyal to the history of the nation, carry on the past and open up the future, and promote the experience of our nation. The "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production put forward by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong is a summary of the inherent experience of increasing production in my country's agriculture and the successful experience of my country's agricultural technology reform since liberation. It is the crystallization of the combination of the two, and it is the best example of the mutual unification of inheritance and reform. Therefore, under the current conditions, the "Eight-Character Charter" is a scientific and complete fundamental measure for agricultural production increase. All regions have their own inherent experience and reform experience. Only by skillfully combining the two can the proposed measures for increasing production be relatively complete.

          Need and Possibility Must Be Unified

Any reform must pay a certain price to succeed. As long as there is indeed a need—a reform that can indeed increase production, we should take a positive attitude and resolutely change it at the expense of a certain price. For example, changing dry land to paddy fields or irrigated land can make some originally unharvestable fields harvestable, and the yield will increase significantly. It is wrong not to actively change. However, some reforms should be changed from the perspective of need, but they cannot be done for the time being. Should such things be changed or not? At this time, it is wrong to only talk about need one-sidedly, and it is also wrong to passively call for difficulties. The correct attitude should be to unify need and possibility, and on the basis of actual possibility, go all out, act according to our ability, and do our best. Without this, the expected results will not be achieved. Taking the change of dry land to paddy fields or irrigated land as an example again, some places cannot be built without investing a lot of labor and funds because the water conservancy project is too large, and they cannot come up with so much labor and funds for a while. If it is forced on the horse, first, it will squeeze out the current production, and second, it is likely to be forced to dismount halfway. As a result, not only is there a risk of causing floods, but the production of one season or one year will fall into passivity, causing difficulties in the entire work. In this case, even if the change of dry land to paddy fields is indeed needed, it should not be changed temporarily because it is beyond our ability. For example, changing a place with one crop a year to two crops a year or three crops in two years. This reform is a good way to plant more and harvest more, and it needs to be changed. However, if some places are already short of labor and fertilizer is not sufficient, and they can only maintain the original cropping system, if they are changed to two crops a year or three crops in two years, the contradiction of labor tension and fertilizer shortage will be deepened, so that they cannot be planted well every season. As a result, more planting will result in less harvest. In this case, even if it is needed, it should not be changed temporarily. When considering reform based on need, we should not only consider the possibility of subjective strength, but also the possibility of objective conditions. That is to say, on the basis of fully analyzing the possible conditions of both subjective and objective, we should plan all the reforms that are really needed as a whole, classify them, and carry them out separately. Those that need to be done and can be done should be done resolutely, and those that need to be done but cannot be done should be resolutely not done or done slowly. This does not mean "take your time." On the contrary, unifying need and possibility, concentrating forces to fight annihilating battles, changing one piece at a time, and advancing in a down-to-earth manner is the real way to do more, faster, better, and more economically. Otherwise, haste makes waste, and it will turn into less, slower, worse, and more expensive.

The purpose of agricultural technology reform is to make agricultural yields from unstable to stable, and on the basis of relatively stable yields, to strive for increased production. Therefore, the main sign to measure whether a reform is correct is to see whether it has met the requirements of ensuring production and increasing production. Individual reforms, because of special circumstances, cannot benefit in the current year, and may even affect the current year's output. It is permissible to change to large benefits at once. But generally speaking, if the result of the reform is not ensuring production and increasing production, but reducing production, it is better not to change. It is not that the reform itself has problems, but that people have problems in implementing the reform. In this case, we must seriously analyze and study, summarize experiences and lessons, correct shortcomings, and improve understanding, and then do it again.

The relationship between continuous reform and the limits of reform under certain conditions, the relationship between one reform and various other reforms around it, the relationship between bold reform and adapting to local conditions, the relationship between reform and inheritance, and the relationship between need and possibility, these five aspects of the relationship, and the relationship between these five aspects, are all a unity of contradictions. At a certain stage of the development of contradictions, these five aspects of contradictions must take this or that contradiction as the main contradiction, and the others are secondary contradictions. The existence and development of the main contradiction determine or affect the existence and development of other contradictions. Regardless of the main contradiction or the secondary contradiction, the development of the various aspects of the contradiction is unbalanced, and the situation of equal strength is temporary and relative. Therefore, in the two sides of the contradiction, one side must be the main one, and the other side is the secondary one. The main aspect of the contradiction plays a leading role in the development of the contradiction, and the nature of things is determined by the main aspect of the contradiction. The main contradiction and the main aspect of the contradiction are not fixed and unchanging. With the development of the contradiction, the main aspect and the secondary aspect of the contradiction, and the main contradiction and the secondary contradiction, are constantly transformed into each other. For example, when a major technological reform begins to be carried out, the main contradiction may be the contradiction between need and possibility, and the others are secondary contradictions. Once the contradiction between need and possibility is resolved and the movement is launched, the main contradiction may be transformed into the contradiction between reform and inheritance, or other contradictions. The main aspect of the contradiction is also the same. For example, in places where the foundation of technological reform is very poor, when the movement begins, the main aspect of the contradiction may be conservative thinking, not daring to change boldly, resolutely, and actively; after launching education and solving conservative thinking, the main aspect of the contradiction may be transformed into not talking about conditions and blindly changing. The main contradiction and the main aspect of the contradiction are constantly transformed, and people's subjective efforts should also be transferred with their transformation, tightly grasping the main contradiction and the main aspect of the contradiction. The main contradiction represents the mainstream of work, and the main aspect of the contradiction represents the essence of things. Grasping the main contradiction and the main aspect of the contradiction is grasping the mainstream of work and the essence of things. As long as the problems of the mainstream and the problems of the essence are solved, other problems can be solved easily. In practice, there are work centers in different periods. The so-called grasping the center is to grasp the main contradiction and the main aspect of the contradiction.

In the specific method of carrying out reforms, our fundamental experience is: "Let go and mobilize the masses, and everything must be tested." For anything that is not sure, we must first do a small-scale test, and promote it if it is successful, and do not promote it if it is not successful, and do not act rashly. The method of planting experimental fields is the first step for leading cadres to take the mass line, the first step to obtain direct experience, and the first step to find various reform paths under various different conditions. But this is only the "first step." When promoting technological reform, we must continue to adhere to the mass line and consult with the masses on everything. Otherwise, even the best reform that has been successfully tested will not achieve good results because the cadres are there to take care of everything. That is to say, although some reforms can be promoted, because the majority of the masses have not personally participated in the experiment and have not accepted it temporarily, or the majority of the masses have not mastered the technology of this reform, they cannot be promoted reluctantly, but continue to organize the broad masses to participate in the experiment, from one point of experiment to multiple points of experiment, use facts to educate the masses, hand over the technology to the masses, and only after the broad masses have accepted the reform and mastered the technology of the reform can it be fully promoted. The mass-based development of technological reform experiments is a good method of mass self-education, which can not only improve the ideological awareness and technical level of the masses, but also make new technologies supplement new content through practice, making them more perfect.

Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Some of the things we are familiar with are about to become idle, and some of the things we are not familiar with are forcing us to do. This is the difficulty... We must overcome difficulties, and we must learn what we do not understand. We must learn economic work from all experts (no matter who they are). Take them as teachers, learn respectfully, and learn honestly. If you don't understand, you don't understand, don't pretend to understand. Don't put on bureaucratic airs. Drill into it, a few months, a year or two, three years or five years, you can always learn it." Leading agricultural production, especially leading collective agricultural production after the people's commune movement, we have only just begun. This is a subject, and there are many things we do not understand. Not understanding is not terrible, what is terrible is not understanding and not learning. As long as we "learn respectfully and honestly," and "drill into it," "a few months, a year or two, three years or five years, we can always learn it." Who to learn from? We must learn from all experts, and we must learn from the broad masses. In addition, summarizing our own experiences and lessons with the viewpoints and methods of dialectical materialism is also a kind of learning. The experience and lessons of past work are the tricks and potential of future work. As long as we find the tricks and potential in our work and have methods, we will continue to achieve new achievements.

    农业技术改革中的几个辩证关系
    ——再谈领导农业生产必须从实际出发
    鲁力
    积极进行农业技术改革，这是我国农业的现实给我们规定的历史任务。大家知道，我们的农业是刚刚从小农经济改造过来的。小农经济的生产力是低下的，它的生产方法是个体的和分散的，它的生产范围是狭小的。小农经济的这些特点，规定了它在生产技术上的落后性。解放以来，特别是人民公社化以来，在党的正确领导下，我们对于小农经济某些落后方面的东西，进行了一系列的改革，因而有力地促进了农业生产的持续跃进。但是从目前来看，我们在耕作制度和耕作方法等等方面，仍然带有浓厚的、过时的小农经济色彩，某些小农经济时代的耕作方法与耕作制度，和今天的集体生产形式结合在一起，已经显得很不适应，在一定程度上，妨碍了生产力的继续发展。这就是我们当前农业生产的基本现实。面对着这样一个现实，要大办农业、大办粮食，应该怎么办呢？毫无疑问，必须坚持改革，一切妨碍生产力继续发展的落后的东西，必须大胆地改，彻底地改，坚决地改；大改大增产，小改小增产，不改不增产。这是首先要肯定的前提。但是也要看到，如果不根据情况办事，任意乱改，不但不能达到增产的目的，反而会起相反的作用。因此，我们在进行改革或推行某项改革的时候，既要大胆积极，又要因地制宜，从实际出发，就是说，要把敢想说敢干的革命热情和实事求是的科学精神相结合的指导思想，具体地运用到农业技术改革方面来，用辩证唯物主义的观点和方法，处理改革当中的一些问题。更具体地说，就是在进行改革或推行某项改革的时候，要注意处理好如下五个方面的互相统一。
    不断改革要和一定条件下改革的限度统一起来
    改革是无止境的，现在要改，将来也还要改，一万年以后，肯定地说，生产技术仍然要在不断改革的过程中不断发展。事物是不断发展变化的，今天还是先进的东西，到明天就可能变为落后的东西，而落后的东西就要改革。例如有些地方过去是撒播，现在改成了点播，点播比撒播进了一步，但是还不能满足现状，还要改，要改点播为条播。条播在现时来说是先进的，将来有比条播更好的方法出现时，条播就又落后了，就要改为更好的播种方法。这样不断地改，生产才能不断地发展。因此，领导农业生产要树立不断改革的思想，不要有了一点成就就满足起来。但是另一方面，任何改革在一定的条件下，都是有一定的限度的；改革达不到这个限度固然不能增产，超过了这个限度，也不能增产，甚至还会减产。这就是“物极必反”。比如，在一定条件下，水稻每亩插四万蔸左右，比四万蔸以下和四万蔸以上的产量都高，那末四万蔸就应当是水稻在这种条件下的密植限度。不按照这个适当的密度耕作，一味坚持“稀谷大刁”的论调，欣赏二万蔸、三万蔸的旧方法，这就是保守思想作怪，必须反对。但是如果以为四万蔸比二万蔸或三万蔸的产量高，因而就得出结论：五万蔸、六万蔸的产量一定更高，“越密越好”，这种结论就靠不住了。差之毫厘，失之千里。客观条件只许可搞到四万蔸这个限度，超越这个限度，勉强搞五万蔸六万蔸，这就违背了客观事物的规律性，其结果产量不但不会比四万蔸高，甚至还会没有原来的产量高。
    我们提倡生产的准备工作要“一早百早”、实际行动要“适时偏早”。这个方法，过去、现在和将来都是真理。毛泽东同志说：“不打无把握的仗”。把握从何而来？要从充分做好事前准备而来。冬闲的时候就做好春播的准备，春播的同时就做好夏播的准备，真正到了春播和夏播的时候，“万事俱备”，就可以争取主动。只有准备工作抓的早，实际播种才可能做到“适时偏早”。“适时偏早”，这是作物本身生长规律的要求，也是错开活路，缓和劳力紧张矛盾和抢季节的重要办法。因为当前我国农业生产主要还是靠手工操作，工效还不是很高，如果只讲“适时”而不讲“偏早”，其结果，一定是一部分适时，一部分不适时，影响增产；若按“适时偏早”去办，做的结果，可能是小部分稍微偏早，大部分恰好适时。应该早的不早，也是保守思想作怪，必须反对；但是如果以为早比晚好，因而就得出结论：“越早越好”，惊蛰下秧，立秋种麦，这行不行呢？肯定不行。任何作物，都需要有相适宜的气候条件，种下去才会发芽生长，否则是不会发芽生长的。节令和气温，是决定各种作物什么时候播种的基本限度，在这个限度以内适时偏早，是完全正确的和必要的，超越这个限度，不适当地提早再提早，一定要造成烂秧和烂种的损失。
    真理超过一步，就是谬误。辩证唯物主义者要求自己在看问题的时候，既要看到事物不断变化的一面，又要看到相对静止的一面，既要承认主观能动性，又要承认客观规律性。人们认识了客观规律性，根据客观规律行事，才有最大的“自由”；所以恩格斯说这是从必然的王国走向自由的王国。所谓超越了客观事物所许可的限度，就会过犹不及，物极必反。这并不意味着否认客观事物的可变性。如果否认事物的可变性，规定什么“密植极限”，“施肥极限”等等，那是没有根据的。问题在于，当客观事物还没有显著地变化以前，人们只能一面发挥主观能动性，促进客观事物的变化，为不断改革创造条件，一面还要严格遵照一定条件下的限度办事，把不断改革和一定条件下改革的限度统一起来，才不至于碰钉子。
          某一项改革要和它周围的
            各项改革统一起来
    任何事物都不是孤立存在的，一事物和周围其他事物的关系，是互相矛盾，互相联系，互相制约，互相依存的。农业技术改革也是这样的，某一项改革与它周围的各项改革有着密切的联系。这就是说，一项改革能不能成功，不仅决定于这项改革本身的条件是否成熟，还决定于它同周围的各项改革是否相适应。有时候，某项改革是正确的，确确实实应当改，但是如果其他各项改革没有相应地跟上去，而孤立地进行这一项改革，也不能收到应有的效果。再拿密植来说，这一块田到底“密”到什么程度才是合理的？要解决这个问题，不能就密植而论密植，必须全面地研究一下这块田是什么土色，深耕几寸，施肥多少，水利条件等方面的改革如何，如果各方面的改革配合得很好，密度就可以适当加大，如果各方面的条件不好，就不能盲目地一味求密。因为稀植改密植这一措施，只有紧密地和浅耕改深耕、旱地改水地（水浇地）、少施肥改多施肥等等全面地技术改革结合在一起，才能发挥出自己的作用，达到增产的目的。否则，光是稀植改密植，而别的改革都远远落后于密植对它们的要求，密植就会是无益的。那种孤立地以为只要加大了多少下种量就一定能增加多少产量的看法，是形而上学的观点。种子种到浅耕而又没有肥料的土地上，不管你种多么密，肯定没有好的收成。农作物的产量，是由种子、土地、肥料、水、阳光等等条件加在一起，“连因互补”，战胜灾害的结果。这就是说，稀植改密植是好经验，但是离开了它所要求的条件，或者这些条件不完全成熟而盲目地密植，就不会收到预期的效果。肩挑改车子，实现“车子化”，也是这样。实现“车子化”，中心当然是要抓住造车子，没有车子，就谈不上“车子化”，这是很简单的道理。但是仅仅有了车子，是不是送肥、运禾，马上都能用上车子，是不是就算实现了“车子化”？不能这样简单地看问题。车子要在路上走，有了车子没有路或者路很小，车子不能走，还是“化”不成的。因此要肩挑改车子，必须同时小路改大路，只有大批车子和四通八达的大路紧密地结合在一起，主要的运输都是使用车子，才算真正实现了“车子化”。当然有了车子再去修路不是不可以的。问题是，有些地方能修，有些地方不能修（如某些山区和沙洲地），对于不能修路或者暂时不能修路的地方，如果不先解决“路”的问题，只是盲目地造车子，结果只能是劳民伤财，对生产毫无增益。俗话说：红花也要绿叶配。任何一项美好的改革，如果脱离了与之相适应的各项改革的配合，就会变成不可理解的东西。
    大胆地改要和因地制宜地改统一起来
    在进行农业技术改革或推行改革的时候，一方面对于那些应当改而又必须改的东西，要大胆地改，坚决地改，另一方面，又要坚持因地制宜、从实际出发，对于那些暂时还不符合当时当地客观情况的某些改革，要坚决不改或者缓改，不能千篇一律，死搬硬套。客观情况是千差万别的，这个地方能行通的某些改革，那个地方就不一定能行通，在这里可能是好经验，在那里就不一定是好经验，勉强推行不适合本地情况的改革，只会得到坏的结果。例如条播，大量的事实证明，条播是先进的播种方法，比撒播和点播的产量高、费工少。但是这是不是说条播是绝对的好，任何地方都能条播呢？不一定。有些坡度很大的山地，条播器根本放不稳，若硬要条播，就会播得像鸡扒似的一样，还没有点播或撒播的好，像这样的地，显然就不宜于条播。有的地块儿很小，条播器下去转不过身子，种子撒的比播的还多，密一块稀一块，像这样的地，显然也不宜于条播。还有的地，因为前种作物的影响或自然条件的关系，不可能一下子整的很平很碎，条播器下去就像跳舞一样，跳来跳去，播的乱七八糟，像这样的地，显然也不宜于条播。不承认条播确确实实比点播或撒播好，不积极推广条播或不为推广条播创造条件，甚而至于还想从根本上否定条播，是完全错误的；但是另一方面，不承认在有些地方或田块因为具体情况不同，确确实实暂时还不宜于条播，也是错误的。马克思主义告诉我们，只有具体的真理，没有抽象的真理；一切都要依时间、地点和条件为转移。在一切具备了条播条件的地方或田块，采用条播的方法，会得到好的结果，在一切尚不具备条播条件的地方或田块，采用条播的方法，就会得到不好的结果。当然所谓条播的条件也是可以改变或创造的。比如，有些地块儿很小，可以根据情况把小块并成大块，使之适宜于条播，像这样，花一定的代价为推广条播创造条件，是完全必要的应当的。问题是，有些条件目前就可以改变，有些条件一时还不能改变，有些条件花一定的代价加以改变是合算的，有些条件费劲去改变并不合算，还有些条件在现时情况下根本无法改变（如把坡地改成平地），也没有必要改变。推广条播的方法要因地制宜从实际出发，为条播的方法创造条件，同样要因地制宜从实际出发，不可蛮干。就一个地区和一块地来说，到底是改条播好还是不改条播好，要看当时当地的具体情况，要看改了条播以后能不能达到高产省工的目的。要全面地权衡利弊得失，不能只从主观愿望出发，规定一个模子去硬套千差万别的客观情况，如要求什么“一律条播化”等等。点播或撒播改条播是如此，别的技术改革也是如此：既要坚持大胆地改，又要坚持因地制宜地改，只有使二者密切地统一起来，好的改革才会有好的结果。
          改革要和继承统一起来
  我们是历史唯物主义者，看问题不能割断历史。有些东西，在过去的历史条件下是先进的，而在今天的历史条件下是落后的——类似这样的东西，不管过去是多么先进，只要现在已经落后了，就要坚决改革；还有些东西，用发展的观点来看，在将来的历史条件下可能是落后的，但现在还没有完成它的历史使命，因而还是适用的（有的东西可能将来也适用）——类似这样的东西，就要毫不犹豫地继承下来，不可随便抛弃。小农经济的生产方法，和任何别的事物一样，是矛盾的统一，有落后的一面，又有适用的一面，对其一切都肯定是不对的，对其一切都否定也是不对的。正确的态度，应该是区别对待：对于落后的一面要坚决改革，对于适用的一面要加以继承。改革和继承的关系，就生产技术来说，应该是继承第一，在继承的基础上，再去对旧有的生产方法进行调查研究，分类排队，有计划有步骤地进行改革。这样，至少可以做到首先保产，而后再争取增产，不致因为贸然改革而减产。既要改革又要继承，一个重要的问题，就是要解决人们的思想认识问题，这就是，不但要看到改革落后生产方法的重要意义，而且要看到继承前人的经验的重要意义。我们的祖先和自然界打了几千年的交道，积累了相当丰富的经验，把这些经验继承下来，用于生产，对我们社会主义建设有很大的好处，是我们建设事业中不可缺少的重要力量。在前人的经验中，有没有值得继承的东西呢？答复是肯定的。例如，在播种期方面，湖北地区就有过这样的总结：“穷人莫听富人哄，枹桐树开花（清明前后）正下种”；“清明前，好种棉，清明秧，顶稳当”等。在播种质量和方法方面，前人总结有：“深耕加一寸，顶住上道粪”；“人怕胎里瘦，苗怕根不肥”；“千犁万耙，不如早种一夜”；“种地不打沟，等于强盗偷”；“好的葫芦锯好瓢，好的谷种长好苗”；“挖的深，盖的薄，结的托子（苞谷）像牛角”；“要得苞谷结，除非叶打叶”（密植）等。在田间管理方面，前人总结有：“麦锄三道有余粮，别人有荒我不荒”；“苞谷见了铁（锄头），一夜长一节”；“棉锄七道白如银，谷踏三遍（抖草）猪无糠”；“多吃少餐，追肥如加鞭”；“麦熟火来烧，谷熟水来浇”等。在抢收方面，前人总结有：“九成开镰，十成回仓”；“十成收，三成丢”等。前人不但给我们总结了自己的正确经验，也总结了自己犯过的错误和曾经碰到的问题，教育后人要吸取教训。如“多苗如多草，缺苗如缺宝”；“宁可丢秧，不可愁秧”；“过了芒种不种棉，过了夏至不栽田”；“荞麦种迟被霜打”；“过了大雪不种大麦，过了小雪不种小麦”等。在现时条件下，在许多地方，前人总结的这些东西是不是适用呢？这几年的经验证明是适用的。拿前人总结的播种期来说，从湖北省的许多地方来看，清明以前寒潮袭击频繁，几乎是每年的规律，在这些地方，若不慎重地考虑前人这些经验，过早的下种，则是非常危险的，过晚下种，也是有很大坏处的。前人遗留下来的这些经验教训，是我们的一笔极为宝贵的财富，只要有一点可取之处，就必须把这一点继承下来，用于生产建设。我们共产党人不但不排斥我国固有的好经验，恰恰相反，只有我们才真正忠于民族历史，继往开来，发扬我们民族的经验。党中央和毛泽东同志提出的农业生产“八字宪法”，就是总结了我国农业固有的增产经验和解放以来我国农业技术改革的成功经验，是二者相结合的结晶，是继承和改革互相统一的最好典范。因此，“八字宪法”在现时条件下，是科学的、完整的农业增产的根本措施。各地都有自己固有的经验和改革经验，只有把二者巧妙地结合在一起，所提出的增产措施才是比较完整的。
          需要和可能要统一起来
    任何改革都是要付出一定代价才能成功的。只要确实需要——确实能增产的改革，都应当采取积极的态度，不惜付出一定的代价，坚决去改。例如，把旱地改成水田或水浇地，这一改，就能使原来一些不保收的田变为保收了，产量有显著的增加，不积极改是不对的。但是有些改革从需要方面来看是应当改的，就是眼前无力办到，像这样的事情，是改呢还是不改呢？这时候，片面地只讲需要，是不对的，而消极地光叫困难，也是不对的。正确的态度，应当是把需要和可能统一起来，在实际可能的基础上，鼓足干劲，量力而行，尽力而为。不这样，是得不到预期效果的。再拿旱地改水田或水浇地来说，有些地方因为水利工程太大，不投入很多的劳力和资金便修不起来，而一时又拿不出这样多的劳力和资金，若要勉强上马，第一，要挤掉当前生产，第二，很可能中途被迫下马，其结果，不但有酿成水患的危险，而一季或一年的生产都将陷入被动，造成整个工作上的困难。像这种情况，即使旱改水确实需要，因为力所不及，就应当暂时不改。又如一年一熟的地方改一年二熟或二年三熟，这一改革是多种多收的好办法，需要改。但是如果有些地方本来劳动力就很紧张，肥料也不充足，只能维持原来的耕作制度，若是改成了一年二熟或二年三熟以后，更加深了劳力紧张和肥料不足的矛盾，使季季都不能种好，结果多种了反而少收。像这种情况，即使需要，也应当暂时不改。根据需要考虑改革的时候，不但要考虑到主观力量的可能性，还要考虑到客观条件的可能性。这就是说，要在充分分析主客观可能条件的基础上，通盘筹划确实需要的各项改革，分类排队，分别进行。需要办又可能办的就坚决办，需要办但不可能办的就坚决不办或者缓办。这并不意味着“慢慢来”，恰恰相反，把需要和可能统一起来，集中兵力打歼灭战，改一件成一件，扎扎实实地前进，才是真正的多快好省，否则，欲速则不达，反而会变成少慢差费。
    农业技术改革的目的，是为了使农业的产量由不稳定到稳定，并在产量比较稳定的基础上，争取增产。因此，衡量一项改革是否正确，主要标志就看是否达到了保产和增产的要求。有个别改革，因为情况特殊不能当年收益，甚而会影响当年产量，一待改成收益很大，这种情况是允许的。但是一般地说，如果改革的结果不是保产和增产，而是减产，那就以不改为妙。这里不是改革本身有问题，而是人们在执行改革当中有问题，在这种时候，就要认真地分析研究，总结经验教训，纠正缺点，提高认识，然后再干。
    不断改革和一定条件下改革的限度的关系，一项改革和周围其他各项改革的关系，大胆改革和因地制宜的关系，改革和继承的关系，需要和可能的关系，这五方面的关系，和这五方面相互之间的关系，都是矛盾的统一。在矛盾发展的一定阶段上，这五方面的矛盾，必然要以这个或那个矛盾为主要矛盾，其他都属于次要的矛盾。主要矛盾的存在和发展，规定或影响其他矛盾的存在和发展。无论主要矛盾或次要矛盾，矛盾的诸方面，其发展是不平衡的，势均力敌的情形是暂时的相对的，因此矛盾着的两方面中，必有一方面是主要的，他方面是次要的。矛盾的主要方面，在矛盾的发展中起主导的作用，事物的性质，是由矛盾的主要方面所规定的。主要矛盾和矛盾的主要方面，不是固定不变的。随着矛盾的发展，矛盾的主要方面和次要方面，主要矛盾和次要矛盾，经常地互相转化。例如，在一项重大的技术改革开始进行的时候，主要矛盾可能是需要和可能之间的矛盾，其他的则是次要的矛盾。一旦把需要和可能之间的矛盾解决之后，运动展开了，其主要矛盾就可能转化为改革和继承之间的矛盾，或其他矛盾。矛盾的主要方面也是如此。例如，在技术改革基础很差的地方，运动开始，矛盾的主要方面可能是保守思想，不敢大胆地改、坚决地改、积极地改；通过发动教育，解决了保守思想之后，矛盾的主要方面就可能转化为不讲条件，盲目乱改。主要矛盾和矛盾的主要方面是经常转化的，人们的主观努力，也应随着它们的转化而转移，紧紧抓住主要矛盾和矛盾的主要方面。主要矛盾代表了工作中的主流，矛盾的主要方面代表了事物的本质。抓住了主要矛盾和矛盾的主要方面，就是抓住了工作的主流和事物的本质，只要把主流的问题和本质的问题解决了，别的问题就可迎刃而解。在实践中，不同时期有不同时期的工作中心，所谓抓住中心，就是要抓住主要矛盾和矛盾的主要方面。
    在进行改革的具体方法上，我们的根本经验是：“放手发动群众，一切经过试验”。凡是没有把握的事情，都要先作小面积的试验，成功了再推广，不成功就不要推广，不要贸然行事。种试验田的方法，是领导干部走群众路线的第一步，是取得直接经验的第一步，是在各种不同的条件下找出各种不同改革途径的第一步。但这仅仅是“第一步”，在推行技术改革的时候，还要继续坚持走群众路线，遇事和群众商量，否则，即使已经试验成功的最好的改革，也会由于是干部在那里包办代替，而得不到好的结果。这就是说，有些改革虽然可以推广，但是由于多数群众没有亲自参加试验，暂时还不接受，或者多数群众还没有掌握这项改革的技术，就不可勉强推广，而要继续组织广大群众参加试验，由一点试验到多点试验，用事实教育群众，把技术交给群众，待广大群众接受了这项改革并且掌握了这项改革的技术之后，才可以全面推广。群众性的开展技术改革的试验，是群众自我教育的良好方法，不但可以提高群众的思想觉悟和技术水平，还可以使新的技术通过实践而补进新的内容，使之更为完善。
    毛泽东同志说：“我们熟习的东西有些快要闲起来了，我们不熟习的东西正在强迫我们去做。这就是困难。……我们必须克服困难，我们必须学会自己不懂的东西。我们必须向一切内行的人们（不管什么人）学经济工作。拜他们做老师，恭恭敬敬地学，老老实实地学。不懂就是不懂，不要装懂。不要摆官僚架子。钻进去，几个月，一年两年，三年五年，总可以学会的。”领导农业生产，尤其是领导人民公社化以后的集体农业生产，我们才开始入门。这是一门学问，有许多东西我们是不懂的。不懂并不可怕，可怕的是既不懂而又不学。只要我们“恭恭敬敬地学，老老实实地学”，“钻进去”，“几个月，一年两年，三年五年，总可以学会”。向谁学？要向一切内行的人们学，要向广大群众学。此外，用辩证唯物主义的观点和方法总结自己的经验教训，也是一种学习。过去工作的经验和教训，是今后工作的窍门和潜力，只要我们找到了工作中的窍门和潜力，有了方法，就会不断地取得新的成就。
