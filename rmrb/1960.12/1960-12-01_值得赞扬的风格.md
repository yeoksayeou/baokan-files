    A Style Worthy of Praise
    Yan'an University, established on the revolutionary holy land, is growing rapidly. Being able to establish a relatively complete university in the culturally backward Loess Plateau of northern Shaanxi in such a short period is a victory for China's education cause. This university has grown up with the strong support of many institutions of higher learning displaying a high degree of communist spirit; it has also grown up with Yan'an University inheriting and carrying forward the glorious tradition of hard struggle of the people of northern Shaanxi, and overcoming numerous difficulties.
    Look! When many brother universities received information about Yan'an University needing support during its establishment, they immediately extended a hand of friendship. They regarded supporting Yan'an University as a political task to be completed, and they regarded the difficulties of Yan'an University as their own difficulties. Some provided manpower, some provided books, and some provided instruments. The communist style of the supporters was to give convenience to others as much as possible, and leave the difficulties to themselves. They truly did: Whatever Yan'an University needed, they would support it with.
    Under the inspiration of this communist thought, the teachers and students of Yan'an University fully carried forward the spirit of hard struggle and built the school with their own manual labor. One piece of equipment or instrument was used for two or several purposes; one person was used for two or several people's jobs. As long as they could find a way to solve it themselves, no matter how difficult, they would definitely find a way to solve it. Both the supporters and the supported have a high degree of communist style, which embodies the correct relationship between the part and the whole, overcoming difficulties together and moving forward together. Carrying forward the communist spirit of cooperation can overcome all difficulties and move forward. The rapid growth of Yan'an University is a vivid example.

    值得赞扬的风格
    建立在革命圣地的延安大学，迅速地成长起来了。在文化落后的陕北高原上，能够在很短的期间内就建立起一所比较完善的大学，这是我国教育事业的一个胜利。这所大学，是在许多高等学校发扬高度的共产主义精神大力支援下成长起来的；也是在延安大学继承和发扬了陕北人民艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，克服重重困难后成长起来的。
    看吧！当许多兄弟高等学校，得到延安大学建校过程中要求支援的情况后，都立即伸出了友谊的手。他们把支援延安大学都当作一项政治任务来完成，他们把延安大学的困难当作自己的困难。有的支援人力，有的支援图书，有的支援仪器。支援者的共产主义风格，就是尽量把方便让给别人，把困难留给自己。它们真正做到：延安大学需要什么，它们就支援什么。
    延安大学师生在这种共产主义思想的感召下，充分发扬了艰苦奋斗的作风，用自己的双手劳动建校。一样设备、仪器，顶两样或几样用；一个人顶两个人或几个人用。只要自己能设法解决的，无论怎样困难，自己一定设法解决。支援者和被支援者都有高度的共产主义风格，体现了局部和整体的正确关系，共同克服困难，共同前进。发扬共产主义协作精神，就可以战胜一切困难，向前迈进，延安大学的迅速成长就是一个生动的例证。
