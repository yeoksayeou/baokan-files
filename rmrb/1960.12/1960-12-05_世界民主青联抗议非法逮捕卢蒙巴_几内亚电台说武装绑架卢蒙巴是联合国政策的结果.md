Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 4th. The World Federation of Democratic Youth yesterday sent a telegram to the President of the United Nations General Assembly, lodging a strong protest against the illegal arrest of Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba.

The telegram said that the United Nations is responsible for the development of the dangerous situation in the Congo, which threatens the sovereignty and independence of the Congo. In the name of all our members, we strongly protest against the United Nations' recognition of Kasavubu under the conspiracy of the United States and Belgium, and strongly protest against interference in the Congo's internal affairs. We demand the immediate release of Prime Minister Lumumba.

Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, December 3rd. Guinean radio last night commented on the armed kidnapping of Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba by the Mobutu traitorous group, saying that no force can prevent the free people of the Congo and the people of Africa from demanding the release of Lumumba and discrediting the despicable Mobutu traitorous group and their masters – Belgium and the United States.

The commentary said, "Prime Minister Lumumba remains very popular in the Congo. The warm welcome he received yesterday in Kasai Province and in Kikwit, especially the panic that occurred in Leopoldville after his departure, proves this."

The commentary said that the imperialists who participated in the arrest of Lumumba on the afternoon of the 1st also made no secret of their concern about the serious madness of arresting Lumumba. The commentary pointed out that this madness is precisely the result of the policies pursued by the United Nations, the United States, Belgium, Britain, and France in the Congo.

The commentary said that it is certain that insulting Lumumba, who is trying his best to prevent the Congo from becoming an imperialist colony, will generate a fierce reaction among the Congolese people. The eyes of people all over the world will also turn to Leopoldville, because Lumumba is being imprisoned here in Mobutu's barracks.

Xinhua News Agency, Bamako, December 2nd. The National Executive Bureau of the Guinean National Workers' Union and the National Federation of Malian Trade Unions issued a joint communiqué today saying that in the face of repeated offensives launched by imperialist countries against the Congolese people, the two trade unions "urge all African brother countries to rise up to defend the unity and independence of the Congo, and to give unambiguous support to the central government of this country headed by Lumumba, because this government truly represents the Congolese people."

Referring to the Algerian issue, the joint communiqué stated, "Our two national trade unions reiterate their unwavering support for the heroic Algerian people who have been fighting for their independence for seven years." The joint communiqué urged the governments of those African countries that have troops in Algeria to withdraw their troops from this dirty war launched by French colonialism.

    世界民主青联抗议非法逮捕卢蒙巴
    几内亚电台说武装绑架卢蒙巴是联合国政策的结果
    新华社布达佩斯4日电　世界民主青年联盟昨日致电联合国大会主席，就刚果总理卢蒙巴遭到非法逮捕一事提出强硬的抗议。
    电报说，联合国应对刚果危险局势的发展负责，这种发展威胁着刚果的主权和独立。我们以全体会员的名义强烈抗议联合国在美国和比利时的阴谋策划下承认卡萨武布，强烈抗议对刚果内政的干涉。我们要求立即释放卢蒙巴总理。
    新华社科纳克里3日电　几内亚电台昨晚就蒙博托叛国集团武装绑架刚果总理卢蒙巴一事发表评论说，任何力量也不能阻止自由的刚果人民和非洲人民要求释放卢蒙巴，并使卑鄙的蒙博托叛国集团和他们的主子——比利时和美国名誉扫地。
    评论说，“卢蒙巴总理在刚果仍然是十分得人心的。昨天他在开赛省和在基奎特受到隆重欢迎，尤其是在他离开后在利奥波德维尔发生的惊慌，就证明了这一点”。
    评论说，参加1日下午逮捕卢蒙巴的帝国主义者，也毫不掩饰他们为逮捕卢蒙巴的严重疯狂行为而感到担心。评论指出，但是，这种疯狂行为正是联合国、美国、比利时、英国和法国在刚果所奉行的政策造成的后果。
    评论说，可以肯定，对竭力反对使刚果沦为帝国主义殖民地的卢蒙巴实行侮辱，将会在刚果人民中产生猛烈的反应。全世界人民的眼睛也将转向利奥波德维尔，因为卢蒙巴就是被监禁在这里的蒙博托的军营中。
    据新华社巴马科2日电　几内亚全国工人联合会全国执行局和马里工会全国联合会今天发表联合公报说，在帝国主义国家一再向刚果人民发动攻势的情况下，这两个工会“促请所有非洲兄弟国家起来保卫刚果的统一和独立，并给予以卢蒙巴为首的这个国家的中央政府以毫不含糊的支持，因为这个政府是真正代表刚果人民的。”
    联合公报在谈到阿尔及利亚问题时说，“我们这两个全国性工会重申它们坚持不懈地支持七年来为自己的独立而斗争的英勇的阿尔及利亚人民。”联合公报敦促那些在阿尔及利亚派有军队的非洲国家政府把它们的部队撤出这场由法国殖民主义者发动的肮脏战争。
