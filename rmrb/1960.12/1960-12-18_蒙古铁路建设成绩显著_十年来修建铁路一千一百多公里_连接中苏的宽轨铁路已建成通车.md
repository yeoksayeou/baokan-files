Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, 16th December. Damba Darza, Deputy Director of the Ulan Bator Railway Administration, said at a press conference held today to mark the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the Administration that over the past ten years, Mongolia has built more than 1,100 kilometers of railways, including a broad-gauge railway connecting China and the Soviet Union. Eighty percent of the locomotives in use are the most modern diesel locomotives.
    He said that before the People's Revolution, Mongolia did not have a single railway. In 1937, with the help of the Soviet Union, a small 42-kilometer railway was built from Nalaikh to Ulan Bator. In 1950, the railway was converted to a broad-gauge railway. He said that the number of national railway cadres and workers has increased from more than 210 in 1951 to the current 5,384.
    He said that through the efforts of all employees, the Railway Administration has become one of the advanced enterprises in the country. It has put forward many proposals of national significance, such as the proposal in 1958 to save one fen (Mongolian currency) in every tugrik of expenditure, followed by the proposal that mental workers participate in 27 days of physical labor each year. In 1959, in order to consolidate agricultural and pastoral cooperatives, it was proposed to accumulate 8 million tugriks of funds for agricultural and pastoral cooperatives in 1959, and these tasks were overfulfilled.
    He then introduced the situation of the "Strive to be a Socialist Labor Team" movement carried out by the Administration. He said that 90% of the people in the Administration are participating in this movement. All employees of the Administration have developed the habit of collective production, life, and study. Many socialist labor teams and those striving to become socialist labor teams have established canteens and kindergartens. Many family members have also participated in production, greatly enhancing the collectivist ideology of the employees.
    He said that as a result of the efforts of all employees, after completing the Three-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule, they also overfulfilled this year's plan by 0.7% ahead of schedule. Not only that, but with a large increase in freight volume, the number of employees is 1,500 less than three years ago.

    蒙古铁路建设成绩显著
    十年来修建铁路一千一百多公里  连接中苏的宽轨铁路已建成通车
    新华社乌兰巴托16日电　乌兰巴托铁路总管理局副局长丹巴达尔扎今天在为该局成立十周年而举行的记者招待会上说，十年来，蒙古已经建设了全长一千一百多公里铁路，其中并有连接中国和苏联的宽轨铁路，在使用的机车中有80％是最现代化的内燃机车。
    他说，在人民革命前，蒙古没有一条铁路。1937年在苏联的帮助下才建设了从那莱哈到乌兰巴托的四十二公里的小铁路。1950年又将该铁路改成宽轨铁路。他说，铁路民族干部和工人已由1951年的二百一十余人增加到现在的五千三百八十四人。
    他说，在全体职工的努力下，铁路局已经成为全国的先进企业之一。它曾经提出了很多具有全国意义的建议，如在1958年曾提出了在每一个图格里克（蒙币）的开支中节约一分钱，接着又提出了脑力劳动者每年参加二十七天体力劳动的建议。1959年为了巩固农牧业合作社又提出在1959年为农牧业合作社积累八百万图格里克的资金，这些任务都超额完成了。
    他接着介绍了该局开展争取社会主义劳动队运动的情况，他说，现在全局有90％的人参加了这一运动。全局职工都养成了集体生产、生活、学习的习惯，许多社会主义劳动队和争取社会主义劳动队都成立了食堂、幼儿园。许多家属也参加了生产，大大提高了职工的集体主义思想。
    他说，全局职工努力的结果，在提前一年完成了三年计划之后，又以超额0.7％提前完成了今年的计划，不仅如此，在货运量大大增加的情况下，职工人数比三年前少了一千五百人。
