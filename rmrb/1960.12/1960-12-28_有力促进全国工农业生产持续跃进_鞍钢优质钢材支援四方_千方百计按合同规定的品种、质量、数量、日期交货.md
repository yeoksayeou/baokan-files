Anshan Iron and Steel Vigorously Promotes the Continuous Leap Forward of National Industrial and Agricultural Production
Anshan Iron and Steel's High-Quality Steel Supports All Sides
Deliver Goods in Every Possible Way According to the Variety, Quality, Quantity, and Date Stipulated in the Contract

(Our Correspondent in Anshan, 27th) Anshan Iron and Steel Company's employees are producing high-quality steel in every possible way according to the contract to support the construction undertakings in various parts of the country. Recently, more than 260 train cars loaded with various types of steel have been departing from here daily for more than a dozen provinces and cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Sichuan, and Heilongjiang.

In the past eleven months, the steel produced by Anshan Iron and Steel has supported more than 20 key enterprises and more than 100 machinery manufacturing units across the country. It has not only provided a large amount of construction materials such as I-beams, channel steel, angle steel, medium plates, and seamless steel pipes for the construction of blast furnaces and open-hearth furnace main structures for key enterprises such as Wuhan Iron and Steel and Baotou Iron and Steel, but also produced channel steel, thin plates, seamless steel pipes for the Luoyang No. 1 Tractor Factory, Tianjin Tractor Factory, and other units to manufacture tractors, steam plows, new-style farm implements, as well as medium plates, thin plates, and silicon steel sheets for Shanghai shipyards and Harbin Electric Machinery Factory to manufacture ship hulls and electric motors. This has played a significant role in promoting the continuous leap forward of national industrial and agricultural production.

Under the guidance of the idea of "the whole country as one chessboard," the employees of Anshan Iron and Steel regard supporting the whole country as their top political task, overcome various difficulties in every possible way, and resolutely carry out production according to the contract. From January to November, more than a dozen rolling mills of Anshan Iron and Steel completed the ordering tasks of key units on schedule or ahead of schedule every month. The employees of the medium-sized rolling mill put forward the slogan "What the country needs, we roll; when it is needed, we roll," and since the beginning of this year, they have delivered goods every month according to the variety, quality, quantity, and date stipulated in the order contract. In November, the Harbin, Lanzhou, and Mishan Railway Bureaus needed this factory to produce a batch of medium rails, which was an arduous task exceeding the factory's design capacity. Kang Zhaotian, deputy secretary of the factory's Party committee, and Jiao Yonghe, the factory director from a worker's background, personally went to the rolling workshop to test roll with the workers. After three days and nights of repeated experiments, they finally succeeded in the trial rolling. Tian Yongchen and Liu Fude, workers in the straightening workshop, also designed "punching" equipment to improve production efficiency, so that this batch of medium rails was delivered to the cargo owner two days ahead of the contract deadline. Under the slogan of "no shortage in output, quality must be good, delivery guaranteed ahead of schedule, variety only more and not less," the employees of the First Medium Plate Mill increased the number of new products by twelve steel grades and one thousand four hundred specifications this year compared to last year, completed 100% of the state's variety plan, and the quality was 4.55% higher than the national standard.

Standing at the forefront of rolling steel production, the primary rolling mill, in order to deliver high-quality steel billets to various rolling mills in a timely manner, closely focused on the weak link of heating steel in the soaking pit, and organized the soaking pit workers to carry out a competition of "more loading, fast heating, high temperature, long life, and good slag removal." Zhou Dehui, the foreman of furnace No. 6, and Li Junshang, the foreman of furnace No. 3 of this factory, concentrated everyone's wisdom in the competition and created the "three collective" steel heating method of "collective viewing of steel, collective judgment, and collective handling," which shortened the entire steel heating time by half compared to the past, providing sufficient steel billets for various rolling mills.

In order to deliver the rolled steel to factories, enterprises, and construction sites across the country in a timely manner, the Party Committee of Anshan Iron and Steel Company established a joint transportation command, headed by a manager, and transferred more than a dozen leading cadres from various factories to Anshan North Station and Lishan Station to direct transportation work. Anshan Iron and Steel's transportation department, production department, and supply and marketing department closely cooperated, carried out communist-style collaboration, and placed externally transferred steel in an important position, ensuring that goods were not backlogged and that train cars did not stay, greatly reducing the car's dwell time and improving transportation efficiency.

    有力促进全国工农业生产持续跃进
    鞍钢优质钢材支援四方
    千方百计按合同规定的品种、质量、数量、日期交货
    本报鞍山27日电　鞍山钢铁公司职工，千方百计按合同生产优质钢材，支援全国各地的建设事业。最近每天有二百六十多个载满各种钢材的火车皮，从这里开往北京、上海、天津、四川、黑龙江等十多个省市。
    过去的十一个月，鞍钢生产的钢材，已经支援了全国各地二十多个重点企业和一百多个机械制造单位。它不仅向武钢、包钢等重点企业提供了大量建筑高炉、平炉主体结构架用的工字钢、槽钢、角钢、中板、无缝钢管等建筑材料，而且生产了洛阳第一拖拉机制造厂、天津拖拉机制造厂等单位制造拖拉机、锅驼机、新式农具等用的槽钢、薄板、无缝钢管，以及上海的造船厂、哈尔滨电机厂制造船身和电机用的中板、薄板、矽钢片等。这对促进全国工农业生产持续跃进起了重大作用。
    鞍钢职工在“全国一盘棋”思想指导下，把支援全国看做是头等政治任务，千方百计战胜各种困难，坚决按合同进行生产。从1月到11月，鞍钢十几个轧钢厂月月都如期或提前完成了重点单位的订货任务。中型轧钢厂职工提出“国家需要什么就轧什么，什么时间要就什么时间轧”的口号，今年以来，做到了月月按订货合同所规定的品种、质量、数量、日期交货。11月间，哈尔滨、兰州、密山铁路局需要这个工厂生产一批中轨，这是超过工厂设计能力的艰巨任务。工厂党委副书记康兆田、老工人出身的厂长焦永和，都亲自到轧钢工段去同工人一起试轧，经过三昼夜的反复试验，终于试轧成功。矫正工段工人田永臣、刘福德还设计了“冲眼”设备，提高了生产效率，使这批中轨比合同期限提前两天送到货主手里。第一中板厂职工在“产量斤两不欠，质量一定要好，交货保证提前，品种只多不少”的口号下，今年比去年增加了十二个钢种、一千四百个规格的新产品，百分之百地完成了国家的品种计划，质量比国家规定指标还高4.55％。
    站在轧钢生产最前线的初轧厂，为了及时把优质钢坯送给各轧钢厂，紧紧围绕均热炉烧钢的薄弱环节，组织均热炉工人开展了“多装、快烧、高温、长寿、出好渣”的对手赛。这个工厂的六号炉炉长周德会和三号炉炉长李俊赏两人，在对手赛中集中了大家的智慧，创造了“集体看钢、集体判断、集体处理”的“三集体”烧钢法，使整个烧钢时间比过去缩短一半，为各轧钢厂提供了足够的钢坯。
    为了把轧出来的钢材及时送到全国各地的工厂企业和建筑工地，鞍山钢铁公司党委成立了联合运输指挥部，由一名经理挂帅，从各厂抽调十多名领导干部，分赴鞍钢北部站、立山站指挥运输工作。鞍钢运输部门、生产部门、供销部门紧密配合，开展共产主义大协作，把外调钢材列入重要地位，做到货不积压，车不停留，大大减少了车皮停留时间，提高了运输效率。
