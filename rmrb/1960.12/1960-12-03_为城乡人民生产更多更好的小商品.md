Produce More and Better Small Commodities for Urban and Rural People
Shao Qiu, Secretary of the CPC Kaifeng Municipal Committee

Since 1958, under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line, the production of small commodities in Kaifeng City has achieved high-speed development along with the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and the continuous consolidation and expansion of urban people's communes. Since March of this year, the city has launched a new upsurge in the production of small commodities, centered on the "dragon-netting" of comprehensive utilization of raw materials, the establishment of raw material production bases, and the archiving of small commodity production management. It has also begun to implement fixed factories (workshops, groups), fixed varieties, fixed quantities, fixed specifications, fixed quality, fixed raw materials, and fixed prices for small commodity production, so that small commodity production has entered a new stage of comprehensive arrangement and planned production. According to statistics from eight major categories—general merchandise, knitwear, cultural goods, hardware, electrical appliances, chemicals, new medicines, and native products—there were 3,847 types of products from January to October this year, with 17,243 varieties, an increase of 95.3% compared to the end of 1959. From the perspective of service targets, those serving agricultural production accounted for 13.8%, those serving industrial production accounted for 14.7%, and those serving people's lives accounted for 68.8%.

Small Commodity Production Has Great Potential

The situation of small commodity production in Kaifeng City clearly tells us that small commodity production is an indispensable part of industrial and agricultural production and people's lives. Although its products are generally small, of low value, and the production methods are relatively simple, even the smallest and simplest products, such as wire nails, horseshoes, needles, thread, locks, scissors, hairpins, stove bars, children's toys, etc., are indispensable for production and people's lives. Moreover, with the continuous leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the continuous improvement of people's lives, people's needs for small commodities, whether in terms of quantity, quality, or variety, will become higher and higher. Some people believe that engaging in small commodity production has low output value, low profits, simple technology, no future, and is unimportant. This kind of thinking is one-sided. Whether a product is important or not, or whether it has a future, should not be judged by the size, coarseness, fineness, or output value of the product, but should be considered from the perspective of socialist construction and people's needs.

Judging from the development of small commodity production in Kaifeng City, developing small commodity production has great potential. At present, there are 436 units engaged in small commodity production in Kaifeng City. The sources of raw materials for small commodity production are very broad. Because small commodity production has the characteristics of small size, many varieties, and strong adaptability, in addition to using various raw materials allocated by the state, it can also make full use of the waste materials from large factories. According to statistics from January to October this year, the small commodities produced using edge materials and waste materials in the city accounted for about 70% of the total raw materials used in small commodity production. With the continuous development of the iron and steel industry and the entire industry, it will inevitably provide more and more raw materials for small commodity production. Agricultural production, especially the large-scale small autumn harvest campaign in rural areas, will also provide more raw materials for small commodity production.

Rely on Commune-Run Industries to Develop Small Commodity Production

The establishment, consolidation, and development of urban people's communes have opened up broad avenues for small commodity production. The people's communes in Kaifeng City have established a considerable number of factories. This is a new force in socialist industrial production. For more than two years, commune-run factories have played a huge role in economic construction, especially in the production of small commodities, where the role is particularly significant. Of the 3,847 types of small commodities produced in Kaifeng City from January to October 1960, half were produced by commune-run industries. Because small commodity production can make full use of the waste materials from large factories, generally uses less materials, requires relatively simple equipment, and is easy to master the technology, it is very suitable for commune-run industries to operate. At the same time, in order for large factories to concentrate their efforts on developing advanced, large-scale, precision, and cutting-edge products, it is very necessary for commune-run industries to undertake small commodity production and repair services. However, in order to give full play to the role of commune-run industries in developing small commodity production, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of commune-run industries, arm commune-run industries, and, to the extent possible, help commune-run industries solve the necessary equipment, technology, raw materials, and other problems. In particular, some large factories should regard supporting commune-run industries as their glorious responsibility, transfer their unused machines and waste materials to commune-run industries, provide technical instruction to commune-run industries, and cultivate commune-run industries into their strong assistants. Factories that originally undertook small commodity production and repair services and have now switched industries should actively help commune-run industries "carry on the family line" so that commune-run industries can inherit their original products. Since the beginning of this year, Kaifeng City has registered traditional products and old artisans and formulated a "carrying on the family line" plan. Methods such as inviting people in, sending people out, and holding seminars have been adopted to impart technology. For example, the production of iron locks, iron pots, Songlu brand chalk, long-handled razors, Jing Wenzhou silk, and Lin Qingtai dry tobacco has been taken over by commune-run industries.

Comprehensive Investigation and Research, Rational Arrangement of Production

If we do not pay attention to investigation and research when developing small commodity production, production will lose a clear direction, causing stockpiling or out-of-stock situations, and the market supply cannot be guaranteed. In addition to going to the countryside, factories, and streets to conduct interviews and hold customer symposiums to understand their production and living needs, the salespersons in commercial departments are also very good teachers. They have the most extensive and frequent contact with customers and can best understand the needs of all parties. Therefore, paying attention to collecting and listening to the opinions of salespersons regularly is important for guiding small commodity production. Investigation and research should not only regularly understand needs, but also regularly understand the situation of production equipment and raw materials, so as to organize production based on needs and possibilities and solve problems in production in a timely manner. For more than two years, the Kaifeng City industrial and commercial departments have continuously held customer symposiums, meetings of the ten major personnel (十大员), and organized visits to the countryside. These measures have become an important basis for comprehensively and systematically arranging small commodity production.

Facts have proven that comprehensive planning and rational arrangement are important keys to ensuring small commodity production. In arranging production, in addition to arranging product plans, we must also effectively arrange the supply of raw materials, including how to comprehensively utilize waste materials and technical measures. There should be both long-term plans and short-term arrangements. During the implementation of the plan, if the situation changes, adjustments should be made at any time. Since the second quarter of this year, Kaifeng City has conducted comprehensive planning and comprehensive arrangements based on a relatively comprehensive investigation and research of the situation. The formulated plan was passed down layer by layer, and the masses were fully mobilized to discuss and formulate specific measures, which were checked on schedule. In the process of formulating the plan, the principles of emphasizing quality, quantity, and variety, combining consolidation and expansion, combining high precision and low coarseness, and combining seasonal and peak season market needs were grasped. At the same time, the plan was continuously adjusted around the work center and seasonal changes of each period. For example, during the "Three Autumns" this year, we prominently arranged the production of "Three Autumns" tools. Within twenty days, we manufactured and repaired more than 3,000 pieces of "Three Autumns" tools, which strongly supported the autumn harvest and autumn planting. Then, focusing on cooking utensils and heating equipment, we comprehensively arranged the needs of the winter market. Now, stove mouths, stove bars, coal shovels, and straw curtains needed for winter have been put on the market in large quantities. Because we have grasped the link of comprehensive planning and continuous adjustment, not only has the normal production of the original products been maintained, but also many new products have been developed, enabling the small commodity production in our city to enter a new stage of planned development.

In order to gradually incorporate small commodity production into the plan, continuously improve output and quality, and reduce costs, and to overcome the instability of small commodity production products and raw materials, it is necessary to gradually establish small commodity production bases and implement "seven fixings". After we adopted this measure in the second quarter of this year, we ensured the completion of the production plan, improved product quality, and reduced costs. According to statistics of 32 comparable products in the city, the total cost in the first ten months of this year decreased by 11.15% compared with the same period last year. The key to implementing the seven fixings is to help each production unit solve the idea of ​​liking big and disliking small, and establish the concept of serving socialist construction and serving the people's lives.

On the basis of carrying out the "seven fixings", we should also strengthen the small commodity management system. Since the second quarter of this year, we have generally implemented the small commodity production file responsibility system and compiled a catalog of small commodity production, registering product cards. This makes it easier to arrange production and gradually incorporate small commodity production into the plan.

Large-Scale Collaboration between Industry, Agriculture, Commerce, and Transportation Promotes Small Commodity Production

Small commodity production has a very close relationship with commerce, agriculture, transportation, grain, banks, and finance. Therefore, how to organize large-scale collaboration among industry, agriculture, commerce, and transportation is an important issue related to the prosperity of small commodity production. In order to solve this problem, Kaifeng City launched the "dragon-netting" ten major personnel (industrial marketing staff, production managers, accountants, resident factory staff, commercial purchasing staff, storage and transportation staff, bank credit staff, financial supervisors, transportation freight staff, and grain marketing staff) large-scale collaboration in the city starting in December last year. A total of 105 dragons were formed in the city, breaking the boundaries between regions and departments. Strips and blocks, up and down, left and right, various different collaboration networks are connected together. Through large-scale collaboration, the comprehensive utilization of raw materials was widely carried out, and direct links between factories and communes were organized, and multilateral contracts for the comprehensive utilization of raw materials were signed, fully tapping the potential of raw materials, and achieving "multiple uses of one thing, no waste of all things, and turning waste into treasure". In the first ten months of this year, Kaifeng City used about 2,200 tons of various waste materials, and many production units turned waste materials into treasure. The "dragon-netting" ten major personnel large-scale collaboration also played an important role in increasing new products and improving the quality of old products.

Currently, it is the peak season for urban and rural markets. We must effectively strengthen the leadership of small commodity production, solve the specific problems in production one by one, further increase the output and quality of products, continuously increase varieties, and reduce product costs, to provide more and better small commodities for urban and rural people.

    为城乡人民生产更多更好的小商品
    中共开封市委书记处书记　邵球
    开封市小商品生产从1958年以来，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，随着工农业生产的大跃进和城市人民公社的不断巩固壮大，获得了高速度的发展。今年3月以来，全市范围内又掀起了一个以原料、材料综合利用“龙网化”、原料材料生产基地化、小商品生产管理档案化为中心的小商品生产新高潮，并开始对小商品生产实行定工厂（车间、小组）、定品种、定数量、定规格、定质量、定原料、定价格，使小商品生产开始进入全面安排、计划生产的新阶段。按百货、针织、文化、五金、交电、化工、新药、土产八大类统计，今年1月至10月份产品共有三千八百四十七种，花色品种则达到一万七千二百四十三种，比1959年底增长95.3％。从服务对象看，为农业生产服务的占13.8％，为工业生产服务的占14.7％，为人民生活服务的占68.8％。
    小商品生产大有可为
    开封市小商品生产的情况清楚地告诉我们：小商品生产是工农业生产和人民生活不可缺少的一个组成部分。它的产品虽然一般较小、产值不大、生产方式比较简单，但是，即使是最小、最简单的产品，如洋钉、马掌、针、线、锁、剪刀、发卡、炉条、儿童玩具等，也是生产和人民生活不可缺少的。而且随着工农业生产持续跃进和人民生活的不断提高，人民对小商品的需要无论从数量上、质量上和花色品种上都还会越来越高。有些人认为，搞小商品生产，产值小，利润低，技术简单，没有前途，无关紧要，这种思想是片面的。一种产品重要与否或有没有前途，决不能从产品的大、小、粗、精以及产值多少来划分，而应当从社会主义建设和人民需要来考虑。
    从开封市发展小商品生产的情况来看，发展小商品生产是大有可为的。现在，开封市从事小商品生产的单位达到四百三十六个。小商品生产的原料、材料来源非常广阔。由于小商品生产具有体积小、品种多、适应性强的特点，它除去使用国家分配的各种原料、材料之外，还可以充分利用大工厂的下脚料。据今年1月至10月份统计，全市利用边材废料生产的小商品占整个小商品生产使用原料的70％左右。随着钢铁工业和整个工业的不断发展，也必然为小商品生产提供越来越多的原料、材料。农业生产，特别是农村大搞小秋收运动，也将为小商品生产提供更多的原材料。
    依靠社办工业发展小商品生产
    城市人民公社的建立、巩固和发展，为小商品生产广开了道路。开封市各人民公社兴办了相当数量的工厂。这是社会主义工业生产中的一支新生力量。两年多以来，社办工厂在经济建设中起了巨大的作用，特别是在小商品生产方面，作用特别显著。开封市1960年1月至10月份共生产小商品三千八百四十七种，其中社办工业生产的就有一半。由于小商品生产可以充分利用大工厂的下脚料，一般用料又比较少，需要设备比较简单，技术容易掌握，这就十分适合于社办工业经营。同时，为了使大工厂能够集中力量发展高级、大型、精密、尖端产品，也就十分需要社办工业把小商品生产和修理业务担负起来。但是，要充分发挥社办工业发展小商品生产的作用，就必须切实加强社办工业的领导，武装社办工业，在可能范围内，尽量帮助社办工业解决必需的设备、技术、原材料等问题。特别是一些大厂应该把支持社办工业作为自己光荣的责任，将自己不用的机器和下脚料调剂给社办工业，为社办工业进行技术传授，把社办工业培养成为自己强有力的助手。原来担负小商品生产和修理业务、现在已经转业的工厂，更要积极帮助社办工业“传宗接代”，使社办工业能继承自己原来的产品。开封市今年以来曾经对传统产品和老艺人进行了登记，制订了“传宗接代”规划。采取请进来、派出去、座谈等方法，传授了技术。例如铁锁、铁锅、松鹿牌粉笔、长柄剃刀、景文州丝绸、林清泰旱烟等生产都已有社办工业接替。
    全面调查研究　合理安排生产
    发展小商品生产，如果不注意调查研究，就会使生产失掉明确的方向，造成积压或脱销，不能保证市场供应。调查研究，除了要经常下乡、下厂、下街道进行访问、召开顾主座谈会，了解他们生产生活需要以外，商业部门的营业员，也是很好的老师。他们与顾主接触最广泛、最经常，最能了解各方面的需要。因此，经常注意收集听取营业员的意见，对于指导小商品生产有着重要的作用。调查研究，不仅要经常了解需要，而且要经常了解生产设备和原材料情况，以便根据需要和可能组织生产，并及时解决生产中的问题。两年多来开封市工商部门曾不断召开顾主座谈会，十大员会议，组织下乡访问等。这些措施，已成为全面有计划地安排小商品生产的重要依据。
    事实证明，全面规划和合理安排，是保证小商品生产的一个重要关键。在安排生产中，除了安排产品计划之外，还必须切实安排原料、材料供应，包括如何综合利用下脚料以及技术措施等。既要有长远计划，又要有短期的安排。在计划执行中，情况变化了，要随时进行调整。开封市从今年第二季度开始，在较全面地调查研究情况的基础上，曾进行了全面规划，全面安排。并将制定的规划层层下达，充分发动群众进行讨论，订出具体措施，按期进行检查。在制定计划的过程中，掌握了质量、产量、花色品种并重，巩固与扩大相结合，高精与低粗相结合，时令与旺季市场需要相结合的原则，同时围绕每个时期的工作中心和季节变化不断调整了计划。如今年“三秋”时，我们突出地安排“三秋”工具生产，二十天内，就制造修理“三秋”工具三千多件，有力地支援了秋收秋种。接着又以炊具和取暖设备为重点，全面安排冬季市场需要。现在冬季需用的炉口、炉条、煤铲、草苫已大量上市。由于抓好了全面规划和不断调整这个环节，不仅保持了原有的产品正常生产，而且又发展了许多新产品，使我市小商品生产进入到有计划发展的新阶段。
    为了将小商品生产逐步纳入计划，不断提高产量、质量和降低成本，克服小商品生产产品、原料等存在的不稳定性，必须逐步建立小商品生产基地，实行“七定”。我们从今年第二季度采取这一措施后，保证了生产计划的完成，也提高了产品质量，降低了成本。据全市三十二种可比产品统计，今年前十个月较去年同期降低总成本11.15％。实行七定的关键，是帮助各生产单位解决喜大厌小的思想，树立为社会主义建设服务、为人民生活服务的观点。
    在进行“七定”的基础上，还应当加强小商品管理制度。今年二季度以来，我们普遍实行了小商品生产档案责任制，编制了小商品生产目录，登记了产品卡片。这样就更便于安排生产，将小商品生产逐步纳入计划。
    工农商交大协作促进小商品生产
    小商品生产与商业、农业、交通、粮食、银行、财政等方面，都有极密切的关系。因此，如何组织工、农、商、交等方面的大协作，是关系到小商品生产繁荣的一个重要问题。开封市为了解决这个问题，从去年12月起，在全市范围内，开展了“龙网化”十大员（工业供销员、生产管理员、会计员、驻厂员、商业收购员、储运员、银行信贷员、财政专管员、交通货运员、粮食供销员）大协作。全市共组成了一百零五条龙，打破了地区与地区、部门与部门之间的界限。条条块块，上下左右，各种不同的协作网连系在一起。通过大协作，广泛开展了原料、材料综合利用，组织厂社之间直接挂钩，签订原料、材料综合利用的多边合同，充分挖掘原料、材料的潜力，做到“一物多用，万物不废，废物变宝”。今年前十个月，开封市利用各种废料约两千二百吨，许多生产单位都把废料变成宝。“龙网化”十大员大协作，对增加新产品，提高老产品质量，也起了重要的作用。
                    ×　×　×　×　×　×
    当前正是城乡市场的旺季。我们必须切实加强小商品生产的领导，一个个地解决生产中的具体问题，进一步提高产品的产量和质量，不断增加花色品种，降低产品成本，为城乡人民提供更多更好的小商品。
