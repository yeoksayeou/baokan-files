Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 24th: Tianjin's textile industry has successfully trialed more than 3,000 new varieties this year, of which more than 1,000 have already been put into production.

The new products produced by various factories this year generally have the characteristics of fine organization, strong texture, bright and beautiful design and color matching, and wide use. Among the new varieties of cotton cloth are gabardine and khaki woven with 60-count plied yarn; cotton cloth interwoven with two kinds of yarns with different thickness, color, and twist; double-layer yarn-dyed cloth and double-layer plaid flannel with different colors on the front and back; and jacquard corduroy and jacquard velveteen. Some of these products have high fastness, and some have thick texture. In addition to producing thousands of new brightly colored patterns, some factories have also subjected the dyed cloth to chemical treatment, which not only increases the wrinkle resistance, shrinkage resistance and abrasion fastness of the cotton cloth, but also makes the appearance of some fabrics look like silk, and some like wool. There are also dozens of new varieties specially for industrial production and construction. The successful trial production and production of these new products have significantly improved the production technology level of Tianjin's textile industry.

In the process of vigorously developing new product trial production and production, the workers of various factories have generally put forward the slogan of "filling every gap and scaling every peak," determined to climb the peak of the textile industry. All factories have established special institutions for trial production of new products, and have set aside certain machines and equipment for trial production. In some large factories, each workshop has also organized new product professional groups to carry out mass new product research and design work. In the trial production process, all factories have vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution, reformed machinery and equipment, and made their own indigenous equipment. Since the beginning of this year, the various factories have self-made more than 600 pieces of indigenous equipment for producing new varieties.

    遇缺必补　逢高必攀
    天津试制成功大批新纺织品
    据新华社天津24日电　天津市纺织工业今年以来试制成功新品种三千多种，其中有一千多种已经投入生产。
    各厂今年生产的新产品，一般都具有组织细密、质地坚固、设计配色鲜艳美观、用途广等特点。在棉布新品种中，有用六十支合股纱织的华达呢、卡其；有用粗细、颜色、捻度不同的两种纱支交织在一起的棉布；有反正面颜色不同的双层色织布、双层格绒；还有提花灯心绒、提花平绒等。这些产品有的牢度大，有的质地厚。印染厂除生产了上千种配色鲜艳的新花色外，有些工厂对染好的布还经过化学处理，不仅增加了棉布的防皱、防缩和耐磨牢度，而且外观有的好像丝绸，有的类似呢绒。新品种中还有几十种是专门供工业生产建设用的，这些新产品的试制成功和投入生产，显著地提高了天津纺织工业的生产技术水平。
    各厂职工在大搞新产品试制和生产中，普遍提出了“遇缺必补，逢高必攀”的口号，决心攀登纺织工业高峰。各厂都设立了试制新产品的专门机构，抽出一定的机器设备用于试制。有些大厂的各车间，也组织了新品种专业小组，开展了群众性的新品种研究设计工作。各厂在试制过程中，大闹技术革新和技术革命，改革机器设备和自制土设备。今年以来，各厂自制的用于生产新品种的土设备就有六百多台。
