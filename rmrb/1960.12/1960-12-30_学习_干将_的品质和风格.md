Local Newspaper Commentary Excerpts:

    What distinct characteristics do the "Four Great Gan Jiangs" possess that are worth promoting and diligently learning by every employee comrade? They each have their own characteristics and expertise. Some excel in "daring to think and daring to do," while others stand out as "all-rounders." These are all worth learning. At the same time, they also share many common characteristics that are even more worthy of emulation. First, they are red-hearted and ambitious, listen to the Party, always put "doing" first, and charge ahead in everything. As soon as the Party called for increased coal production, they immediately and decisively said: "You can have as much as you want!" And they did what they said they would, never giving up until the task was completed! This is the key to becoming a Gan Jiang. Because "a tiger fears having wings, and a man fears having ambition." Precisely because they regard socialist construction as more important than everything else, and the Party's requirements as higher than everything else, they will strike wherever the Party points. They derive endless strength from the Party's instructions and support, so they are able to dare to think and dare to do, to take on difficulties and yield conveniences, to be vigorous and to work practically and cleverly. Second, they are always able to unite and motivate the broad masses to jointly complete the tasks assigned by the Party. Here, what is important is not only doing, but also taking the lead in doing. As Pang Guanxiang said, "No matter how powerful a locomotive is, it is only a locomotive if it pulls a train; otherwise, what's the use?" Precisely because the Four Great Gan Jiangs not only strive to be brave and advance at all times, but also consistently unite the masses to work together, they are able to far surpass individual heroes who break through barriers alone, and become role models for the masses. Only then can they promote a faster leap forward in production with collective courage, wisdom, and effort. Third, they not only work hard and practically, but also always try every means, plan meticulously, seize every minute, pay attention to methods, innovate technology, and insist on working cleverly. In this way, the more they work, the stronger their skills become, and the more capable they become. Practical and hard work can also be more sustained and effective. No difficulties can stand in their way, and production tasks can be completed even more outstandingly. Fourth, they are able to continuously revolutionize and move forward forever. Becoming a Gan Jiang is by no means something that can be achieved overnight. One must be at the forefront year after year, moment after moment, and do outstandingly. The characteristic of the Four Great Gan Jiangs is that not only can they avoid arrogance, be humble and prudent, and continue to work hard under conditions of victory, but also, under conditions of difficulty or even setbacks, they can avoid discouragement, strive to become stronger, and continuously move forward.
    If we learn and possess these qualities and characteristics of the Gan Jiangs, we will be invincible and advance without stopping.

### 学习“干将”的品质和风格

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    学习“干将”的品质和风格
    “四大干将”有哪些鲜明的特色，值得每个职工同志发扬光大、认真学习呢？他们各有特点，各有专长。有的是“敢想敢干”出众，有的是“多面手”突出，这都值得学习；同时，他们又有许多共同性的特点，更值得发扬。第一，他们心红志大，听党的话，永远“干”字当头，事事冲在前头。党一号召增产原煤，他们马上斩钉截铁地说：“要多少有多少！”并且说干就干，不完成任务决不罢休！这是能否成为干将的关键。因为“虎怕有翅，人怕有志”；正由于他们把社会主义建设看得重于一切，把党的要求看得高于一切，党指向哪里就打到哪里，从党的指示和支持中得到无穷无尽的力量，所以才能够敢想敢干，见困难就上，见方便就让，生龙活虎，实干巧干。第二，他们始终能团结和带动广大群众，共同完成党交付的任务。在这里，重要的不仅是干，而且是带头干。庞观祥说得好：“火车头再有力量，只有拉列车才算是火车头，不然有什么用呢？”正因为四大干将不但自己能处处奋勇争先，而且能一贯团结群众一起干，所以他们就能够远远胜过匹马单枪闯关斩将的个人英雄，而成为群众的榜样，也才能够群胆群威、群策群力地推动生产更快地跃进。第三，他们不仅苦干实干，而且总是千方百计，周密计划，争分夺秒，讲究方法，革新技术，坚持巧干。这样，他们就越干本领越强，越能干，实干苦干也能越持久，越有效，什么困难都拦不住路，生产任务才能更出色地完成。第四，他们能够不断革命，永远前进。要成为干将，决不是一蹴而就的事情，必须长年累月、时时刻刻走在前面，干得出色。四大干将的特色，就是不仅在胜利条件下能够胜不骄，谦虚谨慎，继续大干，而且在困难、甚至受挫折的条件下，又能够败不馁，发愤图强，不断前进。
    我们学习和具备了干将们的这些品质和特点，就会无往不胜，不停止地前进。
