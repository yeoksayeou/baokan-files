    West German Social Democratic Leaders' Shameless Faces
    Li Yue
    The statement issued by the Conference of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries recently pointed out: "Certain right-wing social democratic leaders have openly turned to the position of imperialism, maintaining the capitalist system and splitting the working class. Because of their hostility to communism and fear of the growing influence of socialism on the world stage, they have surrendered to reactionary conservative forces." This paragraph is a most accurate portrayal of the right-wing leaders of the West German Social Democratic Party.
    Not long ago, the West German Social Democratic Party held a congress in Hanover centered on preparations for the election. At this congress, the right-wing leadership of the Social Democratic Party, ignoring the opposition of the vast majority of grassroots members, passed an election platform that was anti-Soviet, anti-communist, siding with U.S. imperialism and West German militarism, and thoroughly betraying the interests of the working class. The resolutions passed at this congress and the speeches of party leaders repeatedly emphasized the need to "trust" and "rely on" the United States and its new president, openly declaring that West Germany should make more "contributions" to "faithfully" fulfill its "obligations" to the North Atlantic Group, and advocating "effectively equipping" the West German "Federal Defense Force." In a report, party vice-chairman Wehner also called for the execution of a "common" foreign policy with Adenauer's ruling party, and demanded the "withdrawal" of "all differences of opinion and opposition" to the Adenauer party in foreign policy. In terms of domestic economic policy, the party's right-wing leadership openly opposed the slogan of "socialization" of the means of production, and vigorously promoted capitalist slogans such as "maximum economic freedom" and "establishing a competition system." The congress also nominated Brandt, the mayor of West Berlin, a loyal servant of U.S. imperialism and a fanatical advocate of the Cold War, as the candidate for prime minister in next year's election. The shameless acts of the right-wing leaders of the West German Social Democratic Party have completely exposed that they are essentially just loyal servants of imperialism and West German monopoly bourgeoisie.
    In fact, the right-wing leaders of the West German Social Democratic Party have long stood on the side of safeguarding the bourgeoisie on issues related to the fundamental interests of the West German working class. In the past, they also concealed it, using the false banner of "working class" and "socialism". Recently, especially after the United States sabotaged the four-power summit this year, in order to suit the needs of imperialism to salvage the failure of its aggressive policy, step up the creation of international tension, revive West German militarism and oppose the socialist camp, they openly raised the banner of anti-Sovietism, anti-communism and opposition to the working class. As the West German general election approaches next year, the pro-American bosses of the Social Democratic Party are even trying to please the United States to win its support, in order to win the victory in the general election. At the same time, the United States is also trying its best to use the Social Democratic Party's open right-wing shift to further control West Germany. This makes the leaders of the West German Social Democratic Party more actively and thoroughly become pawns of imperialism.
    As soon as the Four-Power Government Summit broke down, the chairman of the West German Social Democratic Party, Ollenhauer, repeatedly issued statements and speeches to defend the crime of the United States in sabotaging the summit, insisting that the meeting failed to take place due to "Khrushchev's fault." Ollenhauer's statement in the West German Federal Parliament also expressed opposition to the Soviet Union's proposals on West Berlin and the German question, and supported the Western countries' and Adenauer's aggressive policy of "German reunification" aimed at annexing the German Democratic Republic. The vice-chairman of this party, Wehner, even openly said that "the enemy now is Ulbricht."
    At the same time, the right-wing leaders of the Social Democratic Party are also trying their best to please the Adenauer government in action. In the West German parliamentary foreign affairs debate on June 30, Wehner and other leaders of the Social Democratic parliamentary group even announced that the "German plan" (which advocated the establishment of a limited arms and nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, and advocated that the two Germanys form a pan-German institution with an equal number of representatives, etc.), which to a certain extent reflected the West German people's desire for relaxation of the situation, published by the Social Democratic Party in March of last year, had "belonged to history" and could no longer be put forward as a "new demand." In short, at this time they were trying their best to show Adenauer: we have so much "commonality" with you, please accept our request for a "common policy"! No wonder not only the lower-level members of the Social Democratic Party called Wehner's speech a "surrender speech", but even some Social Democratic parliamentarians felt humiliated - twenty-one people left the meeting before the vote at that time.
    In the months before this congress, the right-wing leadership group of the Social Democratic Party actively carried out activities, striving to implement and develop their "new line", and further expressed their strong support for the militarization of West Germany. This is particularly evident in the attitude towards West German nuclear armament. Although some of them are still saying that their party opposes West German nuclear armament, this is only a gesture forced by the demands of the vast majority of lower-level members. The spokesman of the party executive committee, Barzisch, described West Germany's nuclear armament as an insignificant "purely military technical issue." Wehner went further and said that West Germany's nuclear armament was a matter of "military necessity", and since the Social Democratic Party had "firmly agreed" to West Germany's "national defense", it could not ignore this "necessity." Barzisch also described the "Committee to Fight Atomic Death" established under the auspices of the Social Democratic Party as a "private action" unrelated to the party organization, and tried his best to obstruct the West German people from carrying out the movement against West German nuclear armament.
    Not only that, during this period, the right-wing Social Democrats were also closely colluding with the West German "Defense Force". Not long ago, in a small town in North Rhine, some Social Democratic politicians held a "first gathering" with "Defense" officers and soldiers to "establish contact." The Social Democratic press bulletin sickeningly promoted that this gathering achieved "complete success", saying that this kind of gathering could "eliminate possible misunderstandings" and "create a climate of cooperation full of trust." Social Democratic trade union leader Richter (chairman of the West German Trade Union Federation led by the party), etc., also held talks with Bonn Defense Minister Strauss and the head of the "Defense" Force in mid-September. It was revealed that the trade union leader agreed to Strauss's request: to allow "Defense Force" officers to speak at youth workers' gatherings to recruit new soldiers, and to "rectify" the attitude of more than six million trade union members against West German nuclear armament.
    The right-wing leaders of the Social Democratic Party have also agreed in principle to the "emergency state" bill, which will be submitted to the West German Federal Parliament for discussion and will deprive the West German people of their democratic rights. This means that they are also prepared to support the West German rulers' measures to step up fascist rule.
    It is not surprising that the right-wing Social Democratic Party is so flattering to the West German militarists. Since the Social Democratic Party was established after the Second World War with the support of Western countries, its right-wing leadership group has always been the vanguard of anti-communism, touting the "freedom" and "democracy" of the bourgeoisie. If you open up the dirty history of these right-wing Social Democratic leaders who bear the signboard of "working class", then their shameless surrender will be clear at a glance. In fact, they are not the working class at all, some of whom are directors of large corporations who receive tens of thousands of marks in allowances and dividends every year (such as DÃ¤ster and Richter), and some are large intellectuals supported by the monopoly bourgeoisie (such as Karl Schmidt).
    When big capitalist bosses need to step up anti-Soviet and anti-communist activities and accelerate the militarization of West Germany, it is necessary to actively use the worker aristocracy and proletarian traitors to carry out deceptive activities among West German workers and the people. The West German Social Democratic Party has actually become a tool for the big bourgeoisie to decorate the facade of "democracy" and deceive workers. However, due to the situation in West Germany after the war, the people urgently demanded peace and opposed war, the party leaders had to express their opposition to Adenauer's policy of relying on the North Atlantic aggressive group to revive militarism, and superficially put forward some empty "socialist" programs to safeguard the interests of workers. But all these deceptive tricks were soon completely exposed. As early as May 1958, after the party's eighth congress held in Stuttgart, some right-wing leaders gave up the struggle and turned to suppressing the demands of workers to hold political strikes. At the special congress in Bad Godesberg in November last year, a so-called "basic principles program" that completely safeguarded the interests of the bourgeoisie was adopted. This new party program is actually the blueprint for this reactionary election platform.
    However, today the open right-wing shift of the West German Social Democratic Party's leadership group can only expose their faces as loyal servants of monopoly capital, thereby educating the lower-level worker members of this party and the broad masses of the West German people from the opposite side, bankrupting them in the face of the increasingly conscious lower-level members and the broad masses of the West German people. Just after Wehner delivered his "surrender speech" in parliament, many local party organizations raised sharp criticisms and protests to the central leadership. The congress of the Frankfurt local party organization held in early July demanded that the party executive committee abandon the surrender line and continue to strengthen the struggle against West German nuclear armament and against the storage of American nuclear weapons on West German soil. Representatives and local cadres of many party grassroots organizations believe that the surrender behavior of right-wing leaders such as Wehner has led to the party's "most serious crisis" and is a "real threat to the party's division." In fact, the Social Democratic Party is also increasingly splitting. One sign is that on November 6, hundreds of influential left-wing members of the party resolutely broke away from the Social Democratic Party controlled by the right-wing leadership and established an "Independent Socialist Association."
    Now many local Social Democratic Party grassroots organizations, disregarding the suppression of the right-wing leadership, are independently launching rallies and demonstrations against the West German Adenauer government's nuclear armament policy. For example, the Building Trade Union Congress held in Hanover not long ago passed a resolution against West German nuclear armament in violation of the wishes of the Social Democratic Party leadership. At the same time, the local organizations of the Social Democratic Party's "Committee to Fight Atomic Death" also actively participated in the commemorative activities for the fifteenth anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima, regardless of the chairman of the committee's ban. At this congress, many representatives, regardless of the suppression of right-wing leaders, expressed their opposition to the resolutions forced through the meeting by the executive committee, and demanded a firm and clear opposition to West German nuclear armament. All this has made the contradictions between the Social Democratic Party leadership group and the vast majority of grassroots members increasingly sharp, and the position of the right-wing leadership group increasingly isolated.
    Now the right-wing leaders of the West German Social Democratic Party are trying to suppress the opposition of lower-level members and cadres. The first thing here is to threaten with "party discipline." In an anti-communist document published by the party executive committee in February this year, it stipulated fourteen "reasons" for expelling party members. At the same time, it uses both coercion and inducement. But all this has no effect, and now even some middle and upper-level people in the party are worried about how long the "unity" within the Social Democratic Party can be maintained.
    The betrayal of the right-wing elements of the West German Social Democratic Party is not unique in Western European countries. This can be seen from the right-wing faces of the British Labour Party and the French Socialist Party. The exposure of the Social Democratic Party's right-wing elements' servile faces of surrendering to the bourgeoisie is obviously a good thing. It will enable the working class and other working people to better understand the reactionary nature of these servants, thereby getting rid of their influence and more resolutely fighting against their reactionary policies.
