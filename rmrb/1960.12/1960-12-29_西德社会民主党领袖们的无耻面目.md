    West German Social Democratic Leaders' Shameless Faces
    Li Yue
    The statement issued by the Conference of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries recently pointed out: "Certain right-wing social democratic leaders have openly turned to the position of imperialism, maintaining the capitalist system and splitting the working class. Because of their hostility to communism and fear of the growing influence of socialism on the world stage, they have surrendered to reactionary conservative forces." This paragraph is a most accurate portrayal of the right-wing leaders of the West German Social Democratic Party.
    Not long ago, the West German Social Democratic Party held a congress in Hanover centered on preparations for the election. At this congress, the right-wing leadership of the Social Democratic Party, ignoring the opposition of the vast majority of grassroots members, passed an election platform that was anti-Soviet, anti-communist, siding with U.S. imperialism and West German militarism, and thoroughly betraying the interests of the working class. The resolutions passed at this congress and the speeches of party leaders repeatedly emphasized the need to "trust" and "rely on" the United States and its new president, openly declaring that West Germany should make more "contributions" to "faithfully" fulfill its "obligations" to the North Atlantic Group, and advocating "effectively equipping" the West German "Federal Defense Force." In a report, party vice-chairman Wehner also called for the execution of a "common" foreign policy with Adenauer's ruling party, and demanded the "withdrawal" of "all differences of opinion and opposition" to the Adenauer party in foreign policy. In terms of domestic economic policy, the party's right-wing leadership openly opposed the slogan of "socialization" of the means of production, and vigorously promoted capitalist slogans such as "maximum economic freedom" and "establishing a competition system." The congress also nominated Brandt, the mayor of West Berlin, a loyal servant of U.S. imperialism and a fanatical advocate of the Cold War, as the candidate for prime minister in next year's election. The shameless acts of the right-wing leaders of the West German Social Democratic Party have completely exposed that they are essentially just loyal servants of imperialism and West German monopoly bourgeoisie.
    In fact, the right-wing leaders of the West German Social Democratic Party have long stood on the side of safeguarding the bourgeoisie on issues related to the fundamental interests of the West German working class. In the past, they also concealed it, using the false banner of "working class" and "socialism". Recently, especially after the United States sabotaged the four-power summit this year, in order to suit the needs of imperialism to salvage the failure of its aggressive policy, step up the creation of international tension, revive West German militarism and oppose the socialist camp, they openly raised the banner of anti-Sovietism, anti-communism and opposition to the working class. As the West German general election approaches next year, the pro-American bosses of the Social Democratic Party are even trying to please the United States to win its support, in order to win the victory in the general election. At the same time, the United States is also trying its best to use the Social Democratic Party's open right-wing shift to further control West Germany. This makes the leaders of the West German Social Democratic Party more actively and thoroughly become pawns of imperialism.
    As soon as the Four-Power Government Summit broke down, the chairman of the West German Social Democratic Party, Ollenhauer, repeatedly issued statements and speeches to defend the crime of the United States in sabotaging the summit, insisting that the meeting failed to take place due to "Khrushchev's fault." Ollenhauer's statement in the West German Federal Parliament also expressed opposition to the Soviet Union's proposals on West Berlin and the German question, and supported the Western countries' and Adenauer's aggressive policy of "German reunification" aimed at annexing the German Democratic Republic. The vice-chairman of this party, Wehner, even openly said that "the enemy now is Ulbricht."
    At the same time, the right-wing leaders of the Social Democratic Party are also trying their best to please the Adenauer government in action. In the West German parliamentary foreign affairs debate on June 30, Wehner and other leaders of the Social Democratic parliamentary group even announced that the "German plan" (which advocated the establishment of a limited arms and nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, and advocated that the two Germanys form a pan-German institution with an equal number of representatives, etc.), which to a certain extent reflected the West German people's desire for relaxation of the situation, published by the Social Democratic Party in March of last year, had "belonged to history" and could no longer be put forward as a "new demand." In short, at this time they were trying their best to show Adenauer: we have so much "commonality" with you, please accept our request for a "common policy"! No wonder not only the lower-level members of the Social Democratic Party called Wehner's speech a "surrender speech", but even some Social Democratic parliamentarians felt humiliated - twenty-one people left the meeting before the vote at that time.
    In the months before this congress, the right-wing leadership group of the Social Democratic Party actively carried out activities, striving to implement and develop their "new line", and further expressed their strong support for the militarization of West Germany. This is particularly evident in the attitude towards West German nuclear armament. Although some of them are still saying that their party opposes West German nuclear armament, this is only a gesture forced by the demands of the vast majority of lower-level members. The spokesman of the party executive committee, Barzisch, described West Germany's nuclear armament as an insignificant "purely military technical issue." Wehner went further and said that West Germany's nuclear armament was a matter of "military necessity", and since the Social Democratic Party had "firmly agreed" to West Germany's "national defense", it could not ignore this "necessity." Barzisch also described the "Committee to Fight Atomic Death" established under the auspices of the Social Democratic Party as a "private action" unrelated to the party organization, and tried his best to obstruct the West German people from carrying out the movement against West German nuclear armament.
    Not only that, during this period, the right-wing Social Democrats were also closely colluding with the West German "Defense Force". Not long ago, in a small town in North Rhine, some Social Democratic politicians held a "first gathering" with "Defense" officers and soldiers to "establish contact." The Social Democratic press bulletin sickeningly promoted that this gathering achieved "complete success", saying that this kind of gathering could "eliminate possible misunderstandings" and "create a climate of cooperation full of trust." Social Democratic trade union leader Richter (chairman of the West German Trade Union Federation led by the party), etc., also held talks with Bonn Defense Minister Strauss and the head of the "Defense" Force in mid-September. It was revealed that the trade union leader agreed to Strauss's request: to allow "Defense Force" officers to speak at youth workers' gatherings to recruit new soldiers, and to "rectify" the attitude of more than six million trade union members against West German nuclear armament.
    The right-wing leaders of the Social Democratic Party have also agreed in principle to the "emergency state" bill, which will be submitted to the West German Federal Parliament for discussion and will deprive the West German people of their democratic rights. This means that they are also prepared to support the West German rulers' measures to step up fascist rule.
    It is not surprising that the right-wing Social Democratic Party is so flattering to the West German militarists. Since the Social Democratic Party was established after the Second World War with the support of Western countries, its right-wing leadership group has always been the vanguard of anti-communism, touting the "freedom" and "democracy" of the bourgeoisie. If you open up the dirty history of these right-wing Social Democratic leaders who bear the signboard of "working class", then their shameless surrender will be clear at a glance. In fact, they are not the working class at all, some of whom are directors of large corporations who receive tens of thousands of marks in allowances and dividends every year (such as Däster and Richter), and some are large intellectuals supported by the monopoly bourgeoisie (such as Karl Schmidt).
    When big capitalist bosses need to step up anti-Soviet and anti-communist activities and accelerate the militarization of West Germany, it is necessary to actively use the worker aristocracy and proletarian traitors to carry out deceptive activities among West German workers and the people. The West German Social Democratic Party has actually become a tool for the big bourgeoisie to decorate the facade of "democracy" and deceive workers. However, due to the situation in West Germany after the war, the people urgently demanded peace and opposed war, the party leaders had to express their opposition to Adenauer's policy of relying on the North Atlantic aggressive group to revive militarism, and superficially put forward some empty "socialist" programs to safeguard the interests of workers. But all these deceptive tricks were soon completely exposed. As early as May 1958, after the party's eighth congress held in Stuttgart, some right-wing leaders gave up the struggle and turned to suppressing the demands of workers to hold political strikes. At the special congress in Bad Godesberg in November last year, a so-called "basic principles program" that completely safeguarded the interests of the bourgeoisie was adopted. This new party program is actually the blueprint for this reactionary election platform.
    However, today the open right-wing shift of the West German Social Democratic Party's leadership group can only expose their faces as loyal servants of monopoly capital, thereby educating the lower-level worker members of this party and the broad masses of the West German people from the opposite side, bankrupting them in the face of the increasingly conscious lower-level members and the broad masses of the West German people. Just after Wehner delivered his "surrender speech" in parliament, many local party organizations raised sharp criticisms and protests to the central leadership. The congress of the Frankfurt local party organization held in early July demanded that the party executive committee abandon the surrender line and continue to strengthen the struggle against West German nuclear armament and against the storage of American nuclear weapons on West German soil. Representatives and local cadres of many party grassroots organizations believe that the surrender behavior of right-wing leaders such as Wehner has led to the party's "most serious crisis" and is a "real threat to the party's division." In fact, the Social Democratic Party is also increasingly splitting. One sign is that on November 6, hundreds of influential left-wing members of the party resolutely broke away from the Social Democratic Party controlled by the right-wing leadership and established an "Independent Socialist Association."
    Now many local Social Democratic Party grassroots organizations, disregarding the suppression of the right-wing leadership, are independently launching rallies and demonstrations against the West German Adenauer government's nuclear armament policy. For example, the Building Trade Union Congress held in Hanover not long ago passed a resolution against West German nuclear armament in violation of the wishes of the Social Democratic Party leadership. At the same time, the local organizations of the Social Democratic Party's "Committee to Fight Atomic Death" also actively participated in the commemorative activities for the fifteenth anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima, regardless of the chairman of the committee's ban. At this congress, many representatives, regardless of the suppression of right-wing leaders, expressed their opposition to the resolutions forced through the meeting by the executive committee, and demanded a firm and clear opposition to West German nuclear armament. All this has made the contradictions between the Social Democratic Party leadership group and the vast majority of grassroots members increasingly sharp, and the position of the right-wing leadership group increasingly isolated.
    Now the right-wing leaders of the West German Social Democratic Party are trying to suppress the opposition of lower-level members and cadres. The first thing here is to threaten with "party discipline." In an anti-communist document published by the party executive committee in February this year, it stipulated fourteen "reasons" for expelling party members. At the same time, it uses both coercion and inducement. But all this has no effect, and now even some middle and upper-level people in the party are worried about how long the "unity" within the Social Democratic Party can be maintained.
    The betrayal of the right-wing elements of the West German Social Democratic Party is not unique in Western European countries. This can be seen from the right-wing faces of the British Labour Party and the French Socialist Party. The exposure of the Social Democratic Party's right-wing elements' servile faces of surrendering to the bourgeoisie is obviously a good thing. It will enable the working class and other working people to better understand the reactionary nature of these servants, thereby getting rid of their influence and more resolutely fighting against their reactionary policies.

    西德社会民主党领袖们的无耻面目
    李越
    最近各国共产党和工人党代表会议发表的声明中指出：“某些右翼社会民主党领袖公开转向帝国主义立场，维护资本主义体系，分裂工人阶级。由于敌视共产主义，害怕社会主义在世界舞台上日益增长的影响，他们向反动保守势力投降。”这一段话，对于西德社会民主党的右翼领袖们来说，是最确切不过的写照。
    不久以前，西德社会民主党在汉诺威举行了以准备竞选为中心的代表大会。在这次代表大会上，社会民主党的右翼领导不顾广大基层党员的反对，通过了一项反苏、反共、投靠美帝国主义和西德军国主义、彻底叛卖工人阶级利益的竞选纲领。在这次大会通过的决议和党领导人的发言，一再强调要“信任”和“依靠”美国和它的新总统，公开声称，西德要为“忠实地”完成它对北大西洋集团的“义务”而作出更多的“贡献”，并且主张“有效地装备”西德“联邦国防军”。党的副主席魏纳在一项报告中还要求同阿登纳的执政党执行“共同的”外交政策，要“撤回”在外交政策方面同阿登纳党的“一切意见分歧和对立”。在国内经济政策上，党的右翼领导集团公然反对生产资料“社会化”的口号，而大肆宣传“经济上最大限度的自由”、“建立一个竞赛制度”等资本主义口号。代表大会并推举美帝国主义的忠仆、冷战的狂热的鼓吹者、西柏林市长勃兰特为明年大选中的总理候选人。西德社会民主党右翼领袖的无耻行径，彻底暴露了他们实质上只是帝国主义和西德垄断资产阶级的忠仆。
    事实上，西德社会民主党右翼领袖早已在有关西德工人阶级的根本利益的问题上站在维护资产阶级的立场上。而过去他们还遮遮掩掩，打着“工人阶级”“社会主义”的假招牌。最近，特别是今年美国破坏四国首脑会议之后，为了适合帝国主义挽救其侵略政策的失败、加紧制造国际紧张局势、复活西德军国主义及敌视社会主义阵营的需要，他们就公开打起反苏反共反对工人阶级的旗帜。随着明年西德大选的临近，社会民主党的亲美派头目更企图以取罪美国赢得美国的支持，来争取大选中的胜利。同时美国也竭力想利用社会民主党的公开右倾进一步控制西德。这就使西德社会民主党的领导人更加积极、彻底地变成帝国主义的走卒。
    还在四国政府首脑会议刚刚破裂，西德社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔就连续发表声明和讲话替美国破坏首脑会议的罪行辩解，硬说会议没有开成是由于“赫鲁晓夫的过错”。奥伦豪尔在西德联邦议院发表的声明还表示反对苏联关于西柏林和德国问题的建议，并支持西方国家和阿登纳企图吞并德意志民主共和国的“德国重新统一”侵略政策。这个党的副主席魏纳甚至公然说“现在敌人就是乌布利希”。
    与此同时，社会民主党右翼领导人又竭力在行动上取媚于阿登纳政府。在6月30日西德议会外交辩论中，魏纳和社会民主党议会党团的其他领袖甚至宣布去年3月社会民主党发表的在一定程度上反映了西德人民要求缓和局势的愿望的“德国计划”（其中主张在中欧建立限制军备和无原子武器区，主张两个德国以同等数目代表组成全德机构等）已经“属于历史”而不能再作为“新的要求”提出来了。总之，他们这时是在极力向阿登纳表示：我们和你们有着这么多的“共同性”，请接受我们的
  “共同政策”要求吧！无怪乎不仅社会民主党下层党员把魏纳的发言称为“投降演说”，甚至一些社会民主党议员也感到屈辱——当时就有二十一人在表决前退出了会场。
    在这次代表大会以前几个月中，社会民主党右翼领导集团积极活动，努力贯彻和发展他们的“新路线”，进一步表示他们对西德军国主义化的竭力支持。这特别明显地表现在对待西德原子武装的态度上。尽管他们当中有些人还在说他们的党反对西德原子武装，但是这只不过是迫于下层广大党员的要求而作的姿态而已。党执行委员会发言人巴尔济希就把西德的原子武装说成是无关紧要的“纯粹军事技术问题”。魏纳则更进一步说西德的原子武装是一个“军事上的必要性”的问题，社会民主党既然已经“坚决赞同”了西德的“国防”就不能忽视这种“必要性”。巴尔济希还把由社会民主党主持成立的“向原子死亡作斗争委员会”说成是与党组织无关的“私人行动”，并竭力阻挠西德人民开展反对西德原子武装的运动。
    不仅如此，这一期间右翼社会民主党人还在同西德“国防军”紧密勾结。不久前在北莱因的一个小城，一些社会民主党的政客同“国防”军官兵举行了“建立联系”的“第一次聚会”。社会民主党的新闻公报肉麻地宣传这次聚会取得了“圆满的成就”，说这种聚会可以
  “消除可能存在的误解”而“创造一种充满信任的合作气候”。社会民主党工会负责人里希特尔（受该党领导的西德工会联合会主席）等在9月中旬也同波恩国防部长施特劳斯和“国防”军负责人举行了会谈。据透露，工会负责人同意了施特劳斯的要求：让“国防军”军官到青年工人集会上去讲话招募新兵，并且要“整顿”六百多万工会会员反对西德原子武装的态度。
    对于波恩政府即将提交西德联邦议院讨论的、剥夺西德人民民主权利的“紧急状态”法案，社会民主党右翼领导人在原则上也已经同意。这就是说他们对西德统治者加紧法西斯统治的措施也准备加以支持。
    西德社会民主党右翼领导如此取媚于西德军国主义者是一点也不奇怪的。本来社会民主党于第二次世界大战后，在西方国家扶植下成立以来，它的右翼领导集团一直就是反共的急先锋、标榜资产阶级的“自由”“民主”。翻开这些打着“工人阶级”招牌的社会民主党右翼领导者肮脏家底看一下，那么对于他们这种无耻的投降也就一目了然了。他们实际上根本就不是工人阶级，其中有些是每年拿着数万马克津贴和红利的大康采恩董事（如戴斯特和里希特尔）、有些则是垄断资产阶级豢养的大知识分子（如卡洛·施密特）。
    大资产阶级老板当需要加紧反苏反共，加速西德军国主义化，就有必要积极利用工人贵族和无产阶级叛徒在西德工人和人民群众中进行欺骗活动。西德社会民主党实际上成为大资产阶级装点“民主”门面、欺骗工人的工具。但是由于战后西德人民迫切要求和平、反对战争的形势下，这个党的领导也不得不表示反对阿登纳依附北大西洋侵略集团复活军国主义的政策，并在表面上提出一些维护工人利益的空洞的“社会主义”纲领。但是这一切骗人的花招不久就完全露出了真面目。早在1958年5月这个党在斯图加特召开的第八次代表大会之后，一些右翼领导人就放弃斗争，转而压制工人举行政治性罢工的要求。而到了去年11月的巴德哥德斯堡特别代表大会上，更通过了一个彻头彻尾维护资产阶级利益的所谓“基本原则纲领”。这个新的党纲实际上就是这次反动竞选纲领的蓝本。
    但是今天西德社会民主党领导集团的公开右倾只能暴露出他们的垄断资本忠实奴仆的面目，从而从反面教育这个党的下层工人党员和西德的广大群众，在日益觉悟的下层党员和西德广大群众面前陷于破产。就在魏纳在议会发表“投降演说”后，许多地方党组织向中央领导提出了尖锐的批评和抗议。法兰克福地方党组织7月上旬举行的代表大会要求党的执委会放弃投降路线，继续加强反对西德原子武装、反对在西德土地上存放美国原子武器的斗争。许多党基层组织的代表和地方干部认为，魏纳等右翼领导人的投降行为导致了党的“最严重的危机”，是“造成党的分裂的实际威胁”。事实上社会民主党也正日趋分裂。11月6日该党的几百名有影响的左翼成员，坚决脱离右翼领导所控制的社会民主党，而成立了一个“独立社会主义联合会”就是一个迹象。
    现在许多地方的社会民主党基层组织不顾右翼领导的压制，自行发动反对西德阿登纳政府的原子武装政策的集会和示威运动。例如不久前在汉诺威举行的建筑工会代表大会违反了社会民主党领导的意愿通过了反对西德原子武装的决议。同时社会民主党的“向原子死亡作斗争委员会”各地方组织也不顾委员会主席的禁令积极参加了广岛被炸十五周年的纪念活动。就在这次代表大会上，许多代表不顾右翼领导人的压制，表示反对执委会强令会议通过的决议，并要求坚决、明确地反对西德原子武装。这一切使得社会民主党领导集团和广大基层党员之间的矛盾越来越尖锐，右翼领导集团的地位越来越孤立。
    现在西德社会民主党的右翼领导正在设法压制下层党员和干部的反对意见。这里首先是用“党的纪律”来威胁。在今年2月该党执委会发表的一项反共文件中，就曾规定了十四条开除党员的“理由”。同时它又威逼诱骗兼施。但是这一切也都起不了什么作用，现在连一些党的中上层人士也在担心社会民主党党内“团结”能维持到什么程度。
    西德社会民主党右翼分子的叛卖行为并不是西欧国家中独一无二的。这可以从英国的工党、法国的社会党的右倾面目上看出来。社会民主党右翼分子投降资产阶级的奴才面目的暴露，显然是一件好事情，它将使工人阶级和其他劳动人民更好地认清这些奴仆们的反动本质，从而摆脱他们的影响，更坚决地同他们的反动政策进行斗争。
