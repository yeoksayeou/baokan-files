Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 27th: The four production teams of the Satellite Management Area of Jiuxian Commune in Wusheng County, Sichuan Province, have vigorously strengthened ideological and political work in the fields in light of the new situation of a large number of laborers being投入生产一线. This has greatly boosted the enthusiasm of commune members and doubled their work drive. Since the beginning of this year, more than 80% of the management area's commune members have fulfilled their labor quotas every month, and more than 30% have been commended or materially rewarded. The entire area has consistently led in the quarterly agricultural work competitions, maintaining its title as a red banner management area.

As early as this spring, the production teams of the Satellite Management Area, based on the situation of a group of laborers being transferred to the forefront of production, strengthened ideological and political work in the fields in various ways under the leadership of the management area branch. Their methods are: First, policies are brought to the fields. After each mobilization meeting for a certain task held by the county or commune, or when a new task begins, cadres, Party and League members, and activists, while working alongside commune members, are assigned to different plots of land to explain tasks and policies to the masses during rest times or other opportunities. They also use concrete accounting methods to make commune members realize the benefits of completing these tasks for the country, the collective, and the individual, so that the Party's policies are comprehensively and specifically implemented. Second, cadres exemplify the implementation of policies and lead commune members by setting an example. For example, the cadres of each team in the management area not only take the lead in working hard during labor but also have their agricultural work and work points determined by the team members' evaluation, just like the other commune members. Under the leadership of the cadres, the attendance rate of commune members in the entire area is very high. Third, informal field heart-to-heart talks are carried out. Cadres, Party members, League members, and activists frequently engage in heart-to-heart talks with the three to five commune members they are responsible for, discussing relevant principles and policies, production, and life; when encountering difficulties in production, technology, or life, cadres often analyze and study them together with the commune members and then determine solutions. In these heart-to-heart talks, cadres conduct a great deal of ideological and political education for the commune members. Fourth, in conjunction with field labor and work point recording, "five-good" commune members are regularly selected, models are established, and commendations or material rewards are given. Because political work has penetrated into the fields, this has ensured that the work and management of each team is more thorough and meticulous, and the enthusiasm of commune members to care for the collective has been further developed. In the past month or so, the Second Team alone has made timely improvements to technical specifications, labor organization, labor remuneration, inspection, and acceptance methods based on the problems raised by commune members on-site, ensuring that commune members are generally satisfied.

    田间思想政治工作开花
    四川旧县公社卫星管理区80％的社员月月完成劳动定额
    新华社成都27日电　四川省武胜县旧县公社卫星管理区的四个生产小队，根据大批劳力投入生产第一线的新形势，大力加强田间思想政治工作，使社员劳动热情高涨，生产干劲倍增，今年以来，这个管理区每月都有80％以上的社员完成劳动定额，有30％以上的社员受到表扬或物质奖励。全区在四季农活评比中样样领先，一直保持了红旗管理区的称号。
    早在今春卫星管理区各生产小队，便根据各方面抽调了一批劳力投入生产第一线的情况，在管理区支部的领导下，采用多种办法加强田间思想政治工作。他们的做法是：一，政策下田。在每次县、社召开某项工作的动员大会以后或新的工作开始时，干部、党团员、积极分子在和社员同劳动时，分工负责在各个地段利用休息时间或其他机会向群众讲任务、讲政策，并通过具体算账的方法，使社员认识到完成这些任务对国家、集体、个人的好处，使党的政策全面具体地贯彻下去。二，干部模范地执行政策，以身作则地带动社员。例如，管理区各小队干部们不但在劳动时都身先士卒埋头苦干，而且所作的农活和所得工分，也都和社员一样，经过全队社员评议确定。在干部的带头下，全区社员的出勤率都很高。三，不拘形式地开展田间谈心活动。干部、党员、团员、积极分子，经常与自己所联系的三至五个社员，在田间交谈心事，有时学习讨论有关的方针政策，有时谈生产、谈生活；在生产、技术、生活等方面遇到困难时，干部也经常和社员在一起分析，研究，然后确定解决办法。在这些谈心过程中，干部对社员进行了许多思想政治教育。四，结合田间劳动和评工记分，经常评选“五好”社员，树立标兵，并给以表扬或物质奖励。由于政治工作深入田间，这就保证了各小队工作和经营管理更加深入细致，社员关心集体的积极性也进一步发挥。近一个多月以来，仅第二小队就根据社员在现场提出的问题，对技术规格，劳动组织，劳动报酬，检查验收方法等，及时作了改进，做到社员普遍满意。
