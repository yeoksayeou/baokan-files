    Enlightenment from Flowing Water
    Xie Yi
    When I was young, I climbed over some deep mountain rocks and saw drops of mountain water falling intermittently from the top of the rock face. On the rock surface was a small pool of clear water, and when it was full, it flowed outwards. Where would it flow? I couldn't guess at the time. Later, I floated wooden rafts in mountain streams, rode sailboats along small rivers, took motorboats on big rivers, and sailed on ships on the ocean. I began to understand that within the vast ocean water, there were drops of mountain water falling from the top of the rocks in my hometown. Traveling thousands of miles, it went through a long road, and finally flowed into the vast ocean.
    This is the road taken by a drop of water, and I think it is also the road taken by every revolutionary.
    How arduous, yes. The path of socialism and communism is both long and arduous. After thousands of mountains, there are still ten thousands of ravines, after finishing one section, there is still another journey. But in the eyes of steadfast revolutionaries, this is nothing. Because the reason why a revolutionary is a revolutionary is because a fiery heart beats in his chest and a strong vitality radiates from his body. He is like the dripping water in the mountain rock, dripping one drop after another, piercing through the hard rock and flowing out. In the deep mountain valleys, under the dense thorns, he flows happily, flowing out of the narrow environment, breaking out from where there is no road, rushing away the dry grass and mud in the valley, bypassing countless steep cliffs and boulders. Although piles of rocks block the way, he rushes forward fiercely, breaking through the encirclement from the weak areas between the rocks and flowing straight down; although from the mountainside to the foot of the mountain is a long and steep cliff, he goes straight ahead without hesitation, rushing straight down from the mountain gorges, turbulent and rapid, pouring down thousands of miles.
    From the high mountains to the ocean, there are countless mountain ranges and ridges blocking the way, but the torrent rushes for thousands of miles, breaks out of the thousands of mountains and valleys, and flows into the sea. Nothing can stop its progress. This is because: it flows continuously. Only by flowing continuously can it not lose its courage and strength, and can it always maintain its beautiful youth. All revolutionaries relied on this vitality to usher in the light in the dark nights of the past, and in the tortuous road ahead, only by speeding up their steps can they surge towards the ocean. For brave revolutionaries, the greater the resistance, the stronger the impulse. A few years ago, I traveled upstream on the Zuojiang River. I stayed overnight by the Yazi Beach. When I woke up in the middle of the night, I heard the roaring sounds of hundreds of beasts. When I went to the river the next morning, I saw the flowing water surging with wild waves, splashing foam, rushing towards the rocky beach in the heart of the river like a flock of ducks like untamed horses. The waves were shining, and the rapid currents were surging, making people feel excited.
    The road for the flowing water to flow to the ocean is not straight. The riverbed sometimes points to the north and sometimes turns to the south, but the turbulent flowing water always flows continuously. Confucius once stood by the river and sighed: "Passing away like this, not ceasing day and night." He was lamenting the rolling flowing water. In fact, it should be praised loudly like singing a hymn, because it flows continuously, so it does not mold or rot, it is indomitable, and its direction remains unchanged.
    A drop of water, in the vast sea, is just a drop after all; but from another perspective, this vast ocean is also made up of drop after drop of water. Xunzi's "Exhortation to Learning" has these sentences: "Accumulating soil becomes a mountain, and wind and rain arise; accumulating water becomes an abyss, and dragons are born...Therefore, without accumulating small steps, there is no way to reach a thousand miles, and without accumulating small streams, there is no way to form rivers and seas." He pointed out the law of development of things. Without one small seed after another, there would be no dense forest, and without a little bit of industrial and agricultural construction, there would be no magnificent socialism and communism. But this requires "accumulation" very much, accumulating the small to make the big, and accumulating the little to make the much. If a drop of water does not merge with many other drops of water, then it will achieve nothing, let alone flow into the ocean to form rivers and seas.

    流水的启示
    谢逸
    年幼时我爬越过一些深山大岩，看见过一滴一滴的山水从岩壁顶上断断续续地掉下来，岩地面上是一小窝清澈澈的积水，满了，就向外流淌。它将流到哪里去呢？当时猜想不出来。以后，我又在山溪里放过木排，沿着小河坐过帆船，在大河里搭过汽艇，海洋上乘过轮船，我才开始懂得，在一片汪洋的海水里面，是包藏着家乡山岩顶上掉下来的那一滴滴山水的。流转千里，它是走过了漫长的道路，终于流到广阔的海洋去了。
    这是一滴水所走的道路，我想，也是每一个革命者所走的道路。
    多么艰苦呵，对的。社会主义、共产主义的道路就是既漫长而又艰苦的。过了千山，还有万壑，走完一段，还有一程。但在坚定的革命者看来，这并不算什么一回事。因为革命者之所以成为革命者，就因为他心胸中跳动着一颗火热的心，他身上发射着崛强的生命力。他像山岩里的滴水，一滴接着一滴，将坚硬的岩石滴穿，流到岩外去。在深幽的山谷里面，在密茂的荆丛下面，他欢欣地流着，从狭窄的境地流了出来，从没有道路的地方闯了出来，冲开谷里的枯草泥沙，绕过数不尽的突崖巨石，虽然垒垒的山石堵住了去路，但他却猛扑猛冲，从山石间的薄弱地带钻出重围，滚滚直流；虽然从山腰到山脚是一道陡长的绝壁，他也一往直前，毫无顾忌地从山峡间直闯下去，湍湍急流，一泻千里。
    从高山到海洋，中间不知阻隔着多少重山岗，横梗着多少道岭脉，但洪流却奔腾万里，从千山万壑中钻出来，流归大海，什么也不能阻挡它的前进，这是因为：它奔流不息。只有奔流不息，才不会丧失自己的勇气和力量，才可以永葆自己美妙的青春。一切革命者在从前那黑夜如漆的日子里，就是依靠着这股活力迎来光明，而在今后的曲折的道路上，也只有加快自己的脚步，才能够汹涌澎湃地奔向海洋。对勇敢的革命者来说，阻力愈大，冲力就愈强。几年前我在左江上游旅行。夜宿鸭仔滩边，中宵醒来，耳边听闻百兽狂吼嚎叫的声音，第二天早晨到江边一看，却是流水擎起狂浪，溅着泡沫，像无缰的奔马一样，扑向江心那鸭群也似的石滩，波光闪闪，疾流滔滔，使人为之振奋不已。
    流水奔向海洋的道路，并不是笔直的，河床有时指向北方，有时转而向南，但滔滔的流水却永远奔流不息。从前孔子曾站在江边慨叹：“逝者如斯夫，不舍昼夜。”他是对滚滚的流水发出悲鸣，其实呢，应该像唱赞美诗一样地去高声歌颂它，因为他奔流不息，所以不霉不腐，百折不挠，方向不变。
    一滴水，在浩瀚的海里，终究也只是那么一滴；但从另一方面去看，这汪洋大海，也就是一滴一滴的水积成的。荀子《劝学篇》里有这么几句话：“积土成山，风雨兴焉；积水成渊，蛟龙生焉……故不积蹞步无以至千里，不积小流无以成江海。”他说出了事物的发展规律。没有一小粒一小粒种子，就不会有密茂的森林，没有一点一滴的工农业建设，也就没有宏伟的社会主义、共产主义。但这很需要“积”，积少成多，积小成大。一滴水如果不和其他许多滴水汇合起来，那就一事无成，更休想流入海洋积成江海了。
