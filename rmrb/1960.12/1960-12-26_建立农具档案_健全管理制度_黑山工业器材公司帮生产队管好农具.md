    Establishing Farm Tool Records and Improving Management Systems
    Heishan Industrial Equipment Company Helps Production Teams Manage Farm Tools Well

    (By Our Correspondent) Since August, the Heishan County Industrial Equipment Company in Liaoning Province has helped two production brigades and six production teams in the Banlamen, Xinlitun, and Dahushan Communes improve their agricultural machinery management and storage systems. This has effectively strengthened farm tool maintenance and storage, and extended the service life of the farm tools.

    First, the company assisted leading cadres of the relevant production brigades and production teams in mobilizing grassroots cadres and commune members to calculate political and economic accounts. This helped them recognize the significance of managing and storing agricultural machinery well, and further established the idea of "everyone managing finances and cherishing farm tools." Next, everyone took action to sort out the farm tools. On this basis, they helped production brigades and production teams establish "farm tool storage and maintenance rooms," re-established farm tool storage ledgers, and assigned dedicated personnel to be responsible for management. Archives were established for large and medium-sized farm tools, and cards were created for small farm tools. These were classified, arranged in order, numbered and registered individually, and stored in designated locations in the warehouse. This ensured that the categories were clear, the storage was orderly, the objects were known through the archives, and there were no errors or confusion. Each farm tool was tagged with a card, which indicated its type, name, horsepower, as well as what was missing or damaged, and whether it could be used. Farm tools used by dedicated personnel throughout the year, such as vehicles and horse-drawn implements, were both centrally managed by the team and contracted to individuals for responsibility, in order to promote the participation of all commune members in management and the conscious maintenance of farm tools.

    After democratic discussion by the commune members, these production teams established some necessary farm tool management systems. The main ones included procedures for farm tool entry and exit from the warehouse, inspection, inventory systems, and reward and punishment systems. In addition to including the conscientious fulfillment of farm tool collection procedures and the cherishing of farm tools as conditions for evaluating "Five-Good Commune Members," each production team also stipulated the service life for each piece of agricultural machinery it owned. They adopted methods of rewarding for exceeding the time limit and appropriately punishing for unwarranted loss or damage, encouraging commune members to manage and cherish farm tools carefully.

    After this company helped the relevant production brigades and production teams improve their farm tool management and storage systems, the number of damaged farm tools decreased, and commune members found it more convenient to collect and use farm tools in designated places. At the same time, it provided a reliable basis for commercial departments to better supply production materials. When the director of the Xinlitun store went to the production teams to investigate the needs for "Three Autumns" production materials, he was able to grasp the types and quantities of farm tools needed by the Huangdi Production Team at a glance, just by looking at the archives. He immediately organized the source of goods and sent seventeen types of items such as sickles and bamboo brooms, totaling five hundred and fifty-six pieces, to this production team in one go, basically meeting the needs of the autumn harvest.

    建立农具档案　健全管理制度
    黑山工业器材公司帮生产队管好农具
    本报讯　辽宁省黑山县工业器材公司8月以来，帮助半拉门、新立屯和大虎山公社的两个生产大队、六个生产小队，分别健全了农业机具管理保管制度，有效地加强了农具维护保管工作，延长了农具的使用寿命。
    这个公司首先帮助有关生产大队、生产小队的领导干部发动基层干部、社员群众算政治账，算经济账，认清了管理和保管好农业机具的意义，进一步树立了“大家理财，爱护农具”的思想。接着，大家动手，对农具进行了清理。在这一基础上，他们帮助生产大队、生产小队建立了“农具保管保养室”，重新建立了农具保管账，设专人负责管理。大中型农具都建立档案，小型农具建立卡片，分类排队，逐件编号登记，定库定位，做到类件分明，存放有序，见档知物，不错不乱。农具上都挂有卡片。卡片上分别注明种类、名称、马力，以及缺啥少啥，能否使用等。常年有专人使用的农具，如车马用具等，既归队统一管理，又由个人负责包干，以促进社员人人参加管理和自觉地维修农具。
    经过社员民主讨论，这些生产队都建立了一些必要的农具管理制度。主要的有农具出入库的手续、检查、清点制度、奖惩制度等。各生产队除将认真履行农具领取手续和爱护农具，列入评比“五好社员”的条件外，还对生产队所有的每件农业机具定出使用年限，采取超期奖励，无故丢失损坏适当惩处的办法，鼓励社员精心管理，爱护农具。
    这个公司帮助有关生产大队、生产小队健全了农具管理保管制度以后，损坏农具的情况减少了，社员取用农具有固定的地方，感到更加方便；同时，为商业部门更好地供应生产资料提供了可靠的依据。新立屯商店主任到生产队调查“三秋”生产资料需要时，在荒地生产队一看档案，就掌握了这个生产队需要农具的品种、数量，当即组织货源，一次就给这个生产队送去镰刀、竹扫帚等十七种五百五十六件，基本上满足了秋收的需要。
