Editorial: Protecting Draught Animals for Safe Wintering

The lack of green fodder in winter, coupled with a severe shortage of feed in the vast disaster-stricken areas, undoubtedly creates difficulties in ensuring the safe wintering of livestock. However, the news items published in today's newspaper regarding the protection of draught animals during wintering demonstrate that the masses have many ways to overcome these difficulties and can still keep the draught animals well-fed and robust.

Draught animals are the primary motive force for agricultural production at this stage. To vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, we must raise draught animals well. With sufficient animal power, we can cultivate the land meticulously and plant in a timely manner. Raising livestock well and developing them rapidly not only enhances the power of agricultural production and relatively saves more manpower, but also serves as an important source of increasing fertilizer.

Protecting draught animals for safe wintering is a crucial task in raising draught animals well currently. All people's communes should take advantage of the winter slack season to strengthen the feeding and management of large livestock, allowing draught animals to rest and recuperate, gain weight, and restore strength, to prepare for spring plowing; at the same time, they should effectively protect the safe wintering of female and pregnant animals, which is conducive to mating and breeding in the spring.

The central aspect of doing a good job in the wintering of draught animals is to solve the feed problem in every possible way. We should face the current feed difficulties squarely and lead the masses to resolutely struggle against these difficulties. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us that we should adopt a correct attitude towards difficulties: "We must acknowledge difficulties, analyze difficulties, and struggle against difficulties." "We work and struggle to solve difficulties." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Vol. IV, "On the Chongqing Negotiations") Long-term revolutionary struggle practice tells us that with difficulties, there are also ways to overcome them, and our many experiences, methods, and knowledge are generated in the struggle against difficulties. In the current work of wintering draught animals, cadres in many places are leading the masses to actively solve the feed problem and have already achieved good experiences.

According to the experience of various places, one way to solve the feed problem is to expand the sources of feed as much as possible. All kinds of by-products of crops should be collected and used in a planned manner. Appropriate arrangements should be made in a planned way for the needs of livestock feed, fuel, fertilizer composting, and other comprehensive processing and utilization. Where conditions permit for grazing, the opportunity for draught animals to rest should be used as much as possible for grazing in the wild; if yellow grass can be collected, a certain amount of labor should be organized to collect wild grass. As long as we think of ways from many aspects, it is definitely possible to open up rich sources of feed. In this regard, the Songzhangzi Commune in Lingyuan County, Liaoning Province, is a very good example. In the past, the Songzhangzi Brigade of this commune was only accustomed to using grain straw as feed. Now, they have mobilized cadres, the masses, and breeders to come up with ideas and methods to expand the sources of feed, turning the shortage of feed grass into a surplus. It can be seen that the feed problem can be solved.

Another way to solve the feed problem is to improve feeding methods, save grass, combine coarse and fine feed, and process it finely, feeding coarse grass carefully. Improving feeding methods can use less grass and feed well. Combining coarse and fine grass for feeding is not just a matter of saving; this practice meets the nutritional needs of livestock. Coarse grass is processed and soaked, which livestock like to eat, and can also increase its nutritional value. Liu Entian, a model breeder of the First Team of the Lala Brigade of the Shaling Commune in Panshan County, Liaoning Province, processes and modulates coarse and hard stalks and rice straw by chopping, crushing, steaming, and cooking, turning coarse grass into fine feed, which livestock love to eat and gain weight. Some places treat rice straw with calcium, which is also a good way to save feed grass and improve its nutritional value (this method was introduced on page 2 of this newspaper on November 18). The masses have many new creations in these methods of expanding feed sources, saving grass, and processing and feeding finely. All people's communes should go deep among the masses to discover, summarize, and promote them.

Another important measure to protect draught animals is to make reasonable use of livestock, especially female and pregnant animals, and to take more care of them during use, which is of great importance to the breeding and development of draught animals. Each commune, production team, and production brigade should, based on the condition, physique, and physiological status of each animal, jointly formulate appropriate use plans by the cadres, breeders, and users of the production team and strictly implement them. Whether draught animals are raised well and whether they can develop rapidly is the common responsibility of breeders and users. They must cooperate with each other and work together. Combining work and rest for draught animals is a positive measure to protect draught animals and benefit production. How to make skillful use of draught animals, combine strong and weak animals, determine work according to livestock, and combine light and heavy work to maintain the health of draught animals is very important. All localities should summarize experience among users and strengthen ideological education on caring for draught animals. In winter, on the principle of ensuring that livestock gain weight and recover, the amount of work should be reduced, and animal power should be saved so as to ensure strong animal power at important times such as spring plowing and summer planting next year.

To protect livestock for safe wintering, there must also be shelters to protect them from the cold so that livestock have a warm and comfortable place to rest. This is an important measure conducive to gaining weight and recuperating, and all localities must earnestly solve it.

The work of wintering draught animals is mainly done directly by the production team. To do this work well, it is necessary to resolutely implement the policy of "team as the foundation, three-level ownership" of the people's commune at this stage, firmly implementing that draught animals are fixed for use by the production team, breeding is also the responsibility of the team, and the production team gives the team and breeders appropriate rewards. Only in this way can we improve the enthusiasm of the production team to raise draught animals well, and it is convenient for the production team to implement a certain responsibility system for all aspects of feeding management, use, and breeding of draught animals. This is a fundamental guarantee for raising and using draught animals well all year round, and also for doing a good job in wintering draught animals.

It is now the severe winter season, which is an important period to strengthen the feeding and management of draught animals. Each commune should cooperate with the production team and production brigade to conduct an in-depth inspection of the implementation of relevant policies, the condition of feed and shelters, the condition of draught animals, and whether there are dedicated personnel responsible for the work of wintering draught animals, etc., in order to discover problems, exchange experiences, and take practical and effective measures to ensure that draught animals are well-fed, warm, and free from disease, so as to gain weight and recuperate, and lay a good foundation for spring plowing, production, and breeding next year.

### 保护耕畜安全过冬

    保护耕畜安全过冬
    冬季青饲料缺乏，在广大受灾地区饲料又很不充足，这当然给保护牲畜安全过冬造成了困难。但是今天本报刊登的几条保护耕畜过冬的新闻，说明群众有很多办法克服这个困难，仍然能够把耕畜喂得膘肥体壮。
    耕畜是现阶段农业生产的主要动力。大办农业、大办粮食，就要养好耕畜。有了充足的畜力，就能够把土地耕得精细，种得及时。把牲畜养得好，发展得快，不仅可以增强农业生产的动力，相对地节省更多的人力，同时也是增加肥料的一个重要来源。
    保护耕畜安全过冬是当前养好耕畜的重要任务。各人民公社应该利用冬闲时期，加强大牲畜的饲养管理，使耕畜休养生息，增膘复壮，保持充足的体力，迎接春耕生产；同时切实保护母畜、孕畜安全过冬，以利春季的配种和繁殖。
    作好耕畜的过冬工作，中心的一环是千方百计地解决饲料问题。我们应当正视今冬饲料的困难，领导群众去坚决地向困难作斗争。毛泽东同志教导我们要对困难抱正确的态度：“我们要承认困难，分析困难，向困难作斗争。”“我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷《关于重庆谈判》）长期的革命斗争实践告诉我们，有了困难，同时也就存在着克服困难的办法，我们的许多经验、办法和知识，正是在同困难斗争中产生的。在当前的耕畜过冬工作中，许多地方的干部，正在领导群众积极地解决饲料问题，已经取得良好的经验。
    根据各地的经验，解决饲料问题的办法之一，是尽量扩大饲料来源。把农作物的各种副产品都搜集起来，有计划地使用。对牲畜饲料、燃料、沤肥和其他综合加工利用等各方面的需要，应有计划地作出适当的安排。有条件进行放牧的，要尽量利用耕畜休闲的机会，野外放牧；可以打搂黄草的，就组织一定的劳力打野草。只要多方面想办法，是肯定可以开辟出丰富的饲料来源的。在这方面辽宁省凌源县宋杖子公社就是一个很好的榜样。这个公社的宋杖子大队，过去只习惯用谷草作饲料，现在，他们发动干部、群众、饲养员，大家出主意想办法，扩大了饲料来源，使饲草不足变为有余。可见饲料问题是可以解决的。
    解决饲料的另一种办法，是改进饲养方法，节约用草，粗细搭配，加工精制，粗草细喂。改进饲养方法，可以作到少用草，喂得好。粗细草搭配喂用，不只是一个节约问题，这种作法合乎牲畜营养的需要。粗草经过加工泡制，牲畜爱吃，又可以增加营养价值。辽宁省盘山县沙岭公社拉拉大队一小队模范饲养员刘恩田，把粗硬的秸秆、稻草，经过切细、碾碎、蒸煮，进行加工调制，把粗草变成精料，牲畜爱吃又增膘。有的地方把稻草进行钙化处理，也是节约饲草和提高营养价值的一个好办法（本报11月18日第二版曾介绍过此项办法）。这种扩大饲料来源、节约用草和加工精喂的办法，群众中都有许多新创造，各人民公社应该深入群众，去发现、总结和推广。
    保护耕畜的另一项重要措施是对牲畜，特别是对母畜和孕畜，要作到合理使役，在使用中多加爱护，这对耕畜的繁殖发展关系很大。各个公社、生产队和生产小队要根据每头牲畜的膘情、体质和生理状况，由生产小队的干部和饲养员、使役员共同定出适当的使役计划，严格执行。耕畜是否养得好、能否发展得快，是饲养员和使役员共同的责任，必须互相配合，共同努力。耕畜的劳逸结合是保护耕畜、有利生产的积极措施。如何作到巧使耕畜、强弱搭配、以畜定活、轻重活相结合，以保持耕畜的健壮，这方面是大有讲究的。各地应该在使役员中总结经验，加强爱护耕畜的思想教育。在冬季，应该在保证牲畜增膘复壮的原则下，减少使役，节约畜力，这样才能在明年春耕夏种等重要关头，保证有强壮的畜力。
    要保护牲畜安全过冬，还必须有避寒的棚圈，使牲畜有温暖舒适的场所可以休息。这是有利于增膘复壮的一项重要的措施，各地要切实地加以解决。
    耕畜的过冬工作，主要是由生产小队直接来作的。要作好这项工作，必须根据现阶段人民公社“队为基础、三级所有”的制度，坚决贯彻耕畜固定给生产小队使用，繁殖也由小队负责，并由生产队给小队和饲养人员以适当奖励的政策。这样才能提高生产小队养好耕畜的积极性，便于生产小队对耕畜的饲养管理、使役和繁殖等各方面实行一定的责任制度。这是常年养好、用好耕畜，也是当前作好耕畜过冬工作的根本保证。
    当前已是严冬季节，正是加强耕畜饲养管理的重要时期。对有关政策的贯彻执行的情况、饲料和棚圈的状况、耕畜的膘情以及耕畜过冬工作有无专人负责等等方面，各公社应该协同生产队和生产小队，进行一次深入的检查，及时发现问题，交流经验，并采取切实有效的措施，保证耕畜吃饱、暖和、不生病，达到增膘复壮，给明年的春耕生产和配种繁殖打下良好的基础。
