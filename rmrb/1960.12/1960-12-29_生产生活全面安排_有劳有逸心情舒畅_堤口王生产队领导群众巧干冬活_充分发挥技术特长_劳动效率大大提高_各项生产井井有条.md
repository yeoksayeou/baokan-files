    Comprehensive Production and Life Arrangements, Labor and Rest, a Happy Mood
    Tikuwang Production Team Leaders Skillfully Organize the Masses in Winter Activities
    Fully Utilize Technical Expertise, Greatly Improve Labor Efficiency, and All Production Tasks are Well Organized
    (Our Newspaper Dispatch) The Tikuwang Production Team of Bozhen Commune, Jiaocheng County, Hebei Province, has made comprehensive arrangements for the winter life and production of its members. They have focused on ingenuity, ensuring a good balance between work and rest, and that all members are well-fed, warmly clothed, and adequately rested, which has strongly promoted winter production.
    To carry out winter production rhythmically, the team arranged production tasks at the beginning of winter. From November this year to the end of February next year, the tasks are: first, to accumulate as much fertilizer as possible to ensure sufficient fertilizer for farming next year; second, to manage wheat well to ensure safe overwintering; third, to deliver some fertilizer to the spring crop fields; also to engage in sideline occupations, manage winter vegetables, etc. How can these tasks be accomplished?
    Clever Planning, Clever Use of Manpower
    Cleverly plan agricultural work, cleverly use manpower according to their abilities, which can not only improve work efficiency and do a good job in winter production, but also ensure that members get adequate rest. Therefore, the Party branch of the team, first of all, under the premise of adhering to the "four fixings" of the small team, mobilized each small team to comprehensively rank the various winter productions. The three small teams all implemented the method of dividing agricultural work into segments and arranging it every seven days.
    The production team is responsible for the comprehensive balance and supervision and inspection of the small team's plan, helping each small team to reasonably arrange agricultural work, adjusting between busy and idle periods, and trying to advance tasks that can be done ahead of schedule.
    In order to rationally use labor, methods of using manpower according to their abilities and assigning work to people based on their strengths were also adopted. In view of the specific situations such as the lightness and heaviness, simplicity and complexity of winter agricultural work, the strength of skills, the strength and weakness of labor, and the height and low of technology, the Party branch helped each small team to carefully sort out the 265 male, female, full and auxiliary labor forces in the whole team, and made comprehensive arrangements according to each person's physical strength, technical expertise, etc. Try to ensure that full labor is not used for work that semi-labor can do; semi-labor is not used for work that auxiliary labor can do; and male labor is not used for work that women can do. For example, sewing pockets and making shoe soles, which are suitable for women, are fixed for 35 female laborers; weaving mats is a technical job, so five laborers with weaving skills are fixed; carrying is a strenuous job, so 11 strong laborers are fixed; and compiling wicker baskets for the granary is a relatively easy craft work, so four semi-laborers who are careful and skilled are selected to do it; fertilizer accumulation is also done by semi-laborers. After such arrangements, the technical expertise of each laborer has been fully utilized, greatly improving labor efficiency and making all agricultural work well organized.
    Grasp the Rules, Work Cleverly
    In order to find a rule for all kinds of winter work, the team held a forum for old farmers during the members' rest time, with the topic "What kind of work is most suitable to do at what time," and let everyone discuss it. Through research, a total of 12 different rules for agricultural work were found. For example, for watering wheat, it is implemented to rest early and late, and water at noon (because it is cold in the morning and evening, and watering is easy to freeze); pulling soil, delivering manure, and picking vegetable leaves have been changed to rest at noon and work in the morning and evening (because the ground thaws at noon, the roads are muddy, and vehicles are difficult to travel). This not only makes the work proceed rhythmically, but also improves work efficiency and ensures the quality of agricultural work.
    All six carts in the team delivered all 550 carts of manure to the fields in ten days, and timely covered the wheat and winter vegetables with winter fertilizer. Since grasping the rules and working cleverly, the whole team has saved 548 labor days in more than a month.
    Innovation in the Production Process
    The production team comprehensively inspected the production process of various agricultural tasks. During the inspection, seven production processes were reformed according to the actual situation and possible conditions. For example, the masses were organized to build bridges and repair roads in four places, and the canteen, mill, warehouse, and water well were centralized, which greatly saved labor. For example, more than 230 mu of wheat in the east of the village need to be covered with more than 400 carts of fertilizer in winter. According to the original calculation of three ditches and two and a half li of road, all six carts in the team could complete the fertilizer transportation in 15 days. After paving the ditches and building bridges, the fertilizer transportation task was completed in only ten days; for example, the canteens of the second and third teams used to be on East Street, the mill was on North Street, and the water well was in the south of the village, which was very laborious to take grain, mill flour, fetch water, and cook. Now, appropriate centralization saves labor and is convenient.
    Establish a Farming Task Board
    In the process of mobilizing the masses to skillfully carry out winter work, the team also promoted the system of a seven-day farming task board with the small team as the unit, according to the small-segment arrangement of various productions. The various agricultural tasks of each stage are announced in advance, so that the members know their tasks in advance and prepare early, overcoming the phenomenon of idling due to lack of preparation and temporary tool search before the event, achieving neat attendance and rapid action. In the past, it sometimes took about half an hour to gather for work, but now a new phenomenon has been formed in which everyone attends early and no one delays work.
    At the same time, in order to avoid the situation of crowded work on sunny days and no work on snowy days, the Party branch has made two sets of arrangements for sunny and snowy days for various agricultural tasks, ensuring that work is done rhythmically on sunny days and some production does not stop on snowy days. For example, it is stipulated that the 60 laborers who deliver manure and manage wheat and winter vegetables work and rest on time on sunny days. Once they encounter snowy days, the 30 laborers who are responsible for managing wheat and winter vegetables will invest in starch processing; the 12 laborers who deliver manure will switch to rice milling and flour milling; and the remaining 18 laborers will also participate in straw cutting and sideline production.
    After the heavy snow in late November, these field workers immediately turned to new production according to their cloudy-day tasks. In five days, they repaired four houses, cut more than 7,000 jin of grass, and milled more than 8,600 jin of flour, preparing enough grain and grass for people and animals for eight days.
    Because the Party branch of this team always pays attention to arranging the lives of the masses, mobilizing the members to skillfully carry out winter work, realizing rhythmic production, ensuring that the members have labor and rest, everyone is in a happy mood, and everyone is beaming, which has greatly promoted the current production. Various agricultural tasks are not only done skillfully, but also greatly ahead of previous years. The 550 mu of wheat in the team was generally watered with freezing water half a month earlier than last year, and one cart of fertilizer per mu was covered, also ten days earlier than last year. In addition to completely clipping the hedges for the 60 mu of overwintering vegetables in the vegetable garden, 8 mu of winter garlic were planted in advance.
    At present, the team has drawn more than 60 laborers to invest in sideline production such as weaving mats, making shoe soles, and transporting goods, and the remaining members are actively pulling soil to prepare for adobe bricks for exchanging kangs next spring, and to prepare materials for wheat greening and spring crop fertilization.

    生产生活全面安排　有劳有逸心情舒畅
    堤口王生产队领导群众巧干冬活
    充分发挥技术特长　劳动效率大大提高　各项生产井井有条
    本报讯　河北交河县泊镇公社堤口王生产队，对冬季社员生活和生产进行了全面安排，在巧字上大作文章，使劳逸结合执行得好，全体社员吃的饱，穿的暖，休息得好，有力地促进了冬季生产。
    这个队为了有节奏地开展冬季生产，入冬就对生产任务作了安排。从今年11月到明年2月底的任务，第一是尽量多积肥，保证明年种地有充足肥料；第二是把小麦管理好，保证安全过冬；第三是给春茬地送一些肥料；还有搞副业，冬菜管理等……。怎样才能完成这些任务呢？
    巧计划　巧用兵
    农活巧计划，量材巧用兵，既能提高工效，搞好冬季生产，又能保证社员适当休息。因此，这个队党支部首先在坚持小队“四固定”的前提下，发动各小队把冬季各项生产进行了全面排队，三个小队都执行了农活分段干，七天一安排的方法。
    生产队负责小队计划综合平衡和督促检查工作，帮助各小队合理摆布农活，段段之间忙闲调剂，能提前干的尽量往前赶。
    为了合理使用劳力，还采取了量材用兵，因人派活的办法。针对冬季农活有轻有重，有简有繁，有技术强的和技术差的，劳力也有强有弱，技术有高有低等具体情况，党支部帮助各小队对全队二百六十五名男女整半和辅助劳动力进行了细致排队，根据每个人的体力强弱、技术特长等做了通盘安排。尽量做到半劳动力能干的活不用整劳动力；辅助劳力能干的活不用半劳动力；妇女能干的活不用男劳动力。如缝口袋、纳鞋底等适合妇女做的活就固定了三十五名妇女劳力；织席是一种技术活，就固定了五名有织席技术的劳力；搞搬运是力气活，就固定了十一名壮劳力；为粮库编荆囤是比较轻闲的工艺活，就挑选了四个干活细致手巧的半劳力去做；积肥也由半劳力来做。这样安排以后，充分发挥了每个劳力的技术专长，大大提高了劳动效率，使各项农活都完成得井井有条。
    抓规律　巧干活
    这个队为了把各种冬活都找出一条规律，利用群众休息时间，召开了老农座谈会，以“啥活在什么时候干最合适”为题，让大家进行了讨论。通过研究，共找出十二种农活的不同规律。比如对浇麦实行早晚两头休息，正当午时浇（因为早晚天冻，浇水易结冰）；拉土、送粪、拣菜叶改成了正当午时休息，早晨傍晚干（因为当午解冻，道路泥泞，车辆行走不便）。这样既做到了干活有节奏的进行，又提高了工效，保证了农活质量。
    全队六辆大车十天时间就把五百五十车粪全部送到地里，及时为小麦、冬菜盖上了过冬肥。抓规律巧干活以来，一个多月的时间全队就节省了五百四十八个劳动日。
    革新生产过程
    这个生产队对各项农活的生产过程全面进行了检查，在检查中根据实际情况与可能条件改革了七项生产过程。如组织群众架桥、补路四处，实行了食堂、磨房、仓库、水井四集中，从而大大节省了劳动力。如村东二百三十多亩小麦，冬季需要盖肥四百多车，按原来转三道沟渠二里半路程计算，全队六辆车十五天才能运完，经垫沟架桥后，仅十天就完成了运肥任务；又如二、三两个小队过去食堂在东街，磨房在北街，水井在村南，取粮、磨面、挑水、做饭往返很费工，现在适当集中以后既省工又方便。
    建立农活榜
    这个队在发动群众巧干冬活中，还根据各项生产的小段安排，以小队为单位普遍推行了七日农活榜的制度。将每段各项农活，提前张榜公布，使社员们提前知道自己的任务早做准备，克服了事前无准备，临时找工具的窝工现象，做到了出工整齐，行动迅速。过去有时光出工集合就要占去半个小时左右，现在形成了一个人人出勤早，个个不误工的新现象。
    同时，为了避开晴天活路拥挤而雪天无活干的情况，党支部对各项农活又做出了晴日和雪天两套安排，保证了晴天有节奏地干活，雪天有些生产不停。例如规定送粪、小麦和冬菜管理的六十名田间作业的劳力，晴天按时劳动，按时休息，一旦遇到雪天，负责小麦和冬菜管理的三十名劳力就投入淀粉加工；十二个送粪的劳力就转入碾米磨面；其余十八名劳力也分别参加铡草和副业生产。
    在11月下旬下了大雪以后，这些田间作业的劳力即按照个人阴天的任务立即转向了新的生产，五天时间修理了四间房屋，铡草七千多斤，磨面八千六百多斤，为人、畜备足了八天的粮草。
    这个队党支部由于时刻注意安排好群众生活，发动社员巧干冬活，实现了有节奏的生产，保证了社员有劳有逸，人人心情舒畅，个个喜气洋洋，从而大大促进了当前生产，各项农活不但干得巧，而且也比往年大大提前。全队五百五十亩小麦比去年提前半月普遍浇了一次冻水，每亩盖了一车肥，也比去年提早十天。菜园里除对六十亩越冬菜完全夹上篱笆以外，提前种上了八亩冬蒜。
    目前，全队已抽出六十多名劳力投入了织席、纳鞋底、搞运输等副业生产，其余社员正在积极拉土以备明春脱坯换炕，为小麦返青和春作物用肥做好物质准备。
