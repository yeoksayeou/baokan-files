   “First-Rate” Steelmaker
    Shi Yun
    The office of the director of the experimental plant of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company was warm as spring. Three pots of verdant celery on the windowsill, set against the blazing red light of the steel fire outside, looked particularly eye-catching. The room was quiet and empty. After waiting for a good while, Deputy Secretary Liu of the plant's Party committee rushed in to fetch something, and we quickly stopped him. This secretary, originally an ironworker at the company, said very frankly:
  “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, we're in a Party committee meeting, I'm in the middle of a speech. How about we talk some other time? … Or you can go take a look at the converter workshop first.”
    Deputy Secretary Liu, seizing the intermittent moments as we walked together, finally satisfied our desire to know more bit by bit.
    “You want to inquire about Ma Xiaoliu and his team?” He pondered for a moment and said, “This youth team is indeed very motivated and has always been a model. The plant leaders and cadres are giving them great help.” He paused, and suddenly a gleam of brilliance appeared in his eyes. “Everyone calls Ma Xiaoliu our plant’s first-rate steelmaker! He attended the Beijing heroes’ meeting at the beginning of the year. He’s really good! He consistently listens to the Party, is willing to study hard, and is not afraid of difficulties, so he has grown very quickly. He is also willing to help others. Even as a steelmaker, he does the work of a first and second assistant, never stopping his hands, always leaving the hottest and most tiring work to himself. When he first joined the plant, he couldn't accurately throw materials into the converter. After work, he would go to the open space to practice shoveling stones. Now he is accurate and fast…”
    We bid farewell to Deputy Secretary Liu and went to the converter workshop. The roar of machinery, the clanging of metal, overhead cranes moving back and forth, and raging flames in the furnace made for a lively scene. Especially when the converter was tilted, it spewed out balls of red flame, shooting out streaks of fire, and bursting into showers of steel sparks in an instant, scattering more than ten feet high, like fireworks in Tiananmen Square during a festival, brilliant and colorful, very beautiful. But the workers, wearing uniform protective clothing, straw hats, colored glass lenses, masks, and gloves, were all strong and robust, full of energy, operating nervously in front of and behind the furnace. It was hard to tell who was Ma Xiaoliu. Just then, a converter was about to tap steel. The leading worker directed the overhead crane to hoist the steel ladle for holding molten steel. At the same time, he and two other workers picked up iron shovels and concentrated the materials next to the furnace in front of the furnace. The red-hot molten steel, as thick as slurry, flowed from the furnace mouth into the steel ladle. The worker quickly shoveled up the material and took turns with the other two, throwing it shovel by shovel into the furnace. His movements were so agile, and his throws so accurate and rapid. We thought: although we haven't met Ma Xiaoliu yet, we have already caught a glimpse of the heroic demeanor of the steelmakers.
    After work, we went to the dormitory for single workers and found Ma Xiaoliu at first sight. His photo is still hanging on the red bulletin board at the plant gate, and it has also been published in newspapers, so it was not difficult to find him. At this moment, he had just taken a shower and was sitting on the bed chatting with his team members. The young men were not as tall and burly as we imagined, but all were of medium build, radiant with health and full of energy, like little tigers. The youngest, Li Yunchen, was only eighteen years old, with a childish face, and was a member of the Communist Youth League. The oldest was Ma Xiaoliu, only twenty-three, lively and yet calm, honest and simple, and already a glorious Communist Party member. Their experiences were also similar. In 1958, they were assigned from schools or rural areas to support the steel industry. Under the Party's training, in just two years, each of them became skilled and excellent steelworkers. Recalling the past, Ma Xiaoliu was very excited and also found it funny, saying: "When I first arrived at the workshop, I was both happy and scared. I was going to become a soldier on the steel front of the motherland, and I was happy from the bottom of my heart. But as soon as the converter was tilted, I ran away, afraid that the steel sparks would fall on me. I thought, before the steel is made, I'll get burned, which would be a bad bargain. After a few times, I felt embarrassed. Why aren't others afraid? Am I the only coward? I asked Master Ni what to do, and Master Ni said: Be bold, you won't get burned. After a long time, I also understood: the more you're afraid of getting burned, the more you'll get burned; the less you're afraid of getting burned, the less you'll get burned. Steel will teach cowards a lesson!" He glanced at everyone and said firmly: "Steelmaking also refines people. This saying is absolutely true." The young men chimed in, discussing, and almost all had the same feeling. Some said: "Each furnace of steel produces both steel and slag. If there is more steel and less slag, it is the same with people; if you are refined, you become steel, if you are not, you become slag." Some said: "You also have to produce high-quality and high-yield. There is also good and bad steel." Talking about these things, the young men's interest was really strong, and each said they wanted to refine themselves into the best alloy steel. One said: "It's good to refine it into silicon steel, which can be used to make motors." One said: "It's good to refine it into No. 25 steel, which can be used to build bridges." Ma Xiaoliu said: "As long as it's good steel, it's very useful. Let me tell you, people say it's difficult to refine good steel in a converter, but our converters, built in just fourteen days, have already succeeded in refining good steel. Next year, we will all refine good steel. Next year, we will have a world of alloy steel!"
    We were afraid of delaying their rest and planned to talk again later. Ma Xiaoliu said: "Don't worry, there is plenty of time to rest. The Party cares very much about the health of the workers and always tells us to rest more. Actually, we are all in good health. Several of us haven't been sick or asked for leave in two years." I didn't know why I was worrying unnecessarily and asked: "Now that there is a combination of work and rest, and the eight-hour production day is not allowed to be extended, can you complete your tasks in the great battle of December?" Ma Xiaoliu's face immediately showed an expression that made people unable not to believe, and said: "Why not? We are confident of finishing ahead of schedule! Completing tasks doesn't depend on extending working hours, it depends on using our brains and having a hundredfold of enthusiasm. Combining work and rest means resting well during rest time, recuperating and accumulating energy, and preparing for the next battle. Didn't Lenin say that people who know how to rest will work better? When it comes to production, we seize the time, because time is steel, and we fight for every second!" Then he talked in detail about the recent production of their team, which had shown a stable increase compared to the previous period. He also talked with great interest about many technical issues related to how to produce more, produce faster, produce better, and protect the furnace. He talked so colloquially, often inserting vivid metaphors, that even we laymen found it very interesting.
    When we returned to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company's guesthouse, it was already dusk. Sitting in the pavilion halfway up Shijingshan Mountain, overlooking the entire view of Shijingshan Iron and Steel, it was like facing a huge, magnificent, colorful, and dynamic oil painting. Look! Red smoke billows, edged with black, rising from the chimneys of the towering blast furnaces, coke ovens, blowers, and converters, and spreading over the steel city in the twilight, turning into colorful clouds and evening glow, and drifting away with the wind. Below, trains and cars shuttle back and forth, whistling. Tall factory buildings stand side by side, and groups of motors inside emit huge roars, shaking the ground. In an instant, thousands of lights shine brightly, like stars, interweaving with the smoke and clouds, making the sleepless steel city even more glorious. At this time, everyone would think: it is not a painter who created this strange oil painting, but those workers who are both intelligent and brave and who fight day and night on the steel front. They, especially Ma Xiaoliu and the generation of new people like him, are adding a few more magnificent strokes to this oil painting with their creative labor in this last month of the great battle.

   “一级品”炼钢工
    石云
    石景山钢铁公司试验厂厂长办公室里温暖如春，窗台上三盆碧绿的芹菜映着窗外冲天的钢火红光显得特别惹眼，屋里却静悄悄地没有人影。等了好一会儿，才见厂党委刘副书记跑进来拿什么东西，我们赶紧拉住他。这位原是本公司炼铁工人出身的书记十分直率地说道：
  “对不起对不起，正开党委会，正发言呢，另外抽时间谈怎么样？……要不你们先到转炉车间去看看。”
    刘副书记抓紧和我们同路走的间歇功夫，终于点滴地满足了我们所要了解的情况。
    “你们想要打听马小六和他的小组吗？”他沉吟了一下，说：“这个青年小组干劲确实很足，一直是上游是标兵，厂的领导正派干部大力帮助他们呢。”停了停，他眼神里忽然放出异彩说：“大伙称马小六是咱们厂里的一级品炼钢工！年初出席过北京市群英会。确实是好样的！他一贯听党的话，肯钻研，不怕困难，所以成长很快。他又肯帮助人，当了炼钢工了，还做一助手二助手的工作，手脚不停，总把最热最累的活留给自己。刚进厂，把材料投进转炉投不准，下班就到空场上铲石子练习，现在又准又快，……”
    我们告别刘副书记，来到转炉车间。轰隆隆，叮叮当，头顶上天车来往，炉膛里烈火滚滚，奔腾喧嚣，好不热闹。特别是当那转炉被摇动的时候，冒出团团红焰，吐出条条火蛇，一刹那喷出朵朵钢花，直射到一丈多高才四散落下来，就像节日天安门上空放的焰火一样，灿烂缤纷，非常好看。可是工人们穿着一式的劳动保护装，戴着一式的柳条帽、有色玻璃镜、口罩、手套，全都矫健壮实，生龙活虎一般，在炉前炉后紧张地操作着，看不出谁是马小六。恰巧这当儿有个转炉要出钢了，头里一位工人一面指挥天车，叫吊过钢包来盛钢水；一面和另外两个工人操起铁锹就把炉旁的材料集中到了炉前。通红的钢水浓得像浆汁，从炉口流出来，灌进了钢包。那工人又赶紧把材料铲起来，和那二人轮番着一锹锹投向炉膛。他的身手是那么矫捷，投得是那么准确、迅速。我们心想：虽然还没遇到马小六，但是已经一睹炼钢英雄们的丰彩了。
    下班以后，我们赶到单身工人的集体宿舍，一眼就找到了马小六。他的照片至今挂在厂门口红榜上，报纸上也登过，所以寻觅他不费难。此刻他刚刚洗过澡，正坐在床上同他小组的伙伴们聊天呢。小伙子们并不像我们想像中那么高大魁梧，都不过中等身材，但都容光焕发，精力充沛，像一头头小老虎一般。最小的李云臣，才十八岁，一脸孩子气，是个共青团员。最大的就数马小六，也才二十三岁，生动活泼而又沉着持重、敦厚朴实，已是一个光荣的共产党员了。他们的经历也都相仿，1958年才从学校或农村里被分配出来支援钢铁工业，在党的培养下，仅仅两年功夫，一个个都成了熟练的优秀的炼钢工人了。现在回忆起来，马小六很兴奋，又觉得好笑，说：“刚到车间时又高兴又害怕，要成为祖国钢铁战线的一名战士了，打心眼里高兴。可是只要一摇转炉，往后就逃，生怕钢花落到身上来，心想钢还没炼成，就先烫着了，多不合算。几次一来，自己不好意思了，人家怎不怕，就我是胆小鬼吗？问倪师傅怎么办，倪师傅说：大胆干吧，烫不着。时间久了我也明白了：你越怕烫越烫着你，你越不怕烫就越烫不着你，钢会教训胆小鬼呢！”他看了大伙一眼，一字一板地说道：“炼钢又炼人，这话千真万确。”小伙子们七嘴八舌，议论开了，差不多都有同感。有的说：“每炉钢又出钢又出渣，钢多渣少，人也这样，炼成了是钢，炼不成是渣。”有的说：“还得要优质高产，钢还有好钢坏钢呢。”谈到这些，小伙子们兴趣真浓，一个个都表示要把自己炼成最好的合金钢。一个说：“炼成其中的矽钢好，可以做马达。”一个说：“炼成其中的25号钢好，可以架大桥。”马小六说：“只要是好钢，都有很大用处。告诉你们，人说转炉难炼好钢，可咱们的这些十四天就建成的转炉，炼好钢已经炼成功了，明年咱们全炼好钢，明年咱们是合金钢的世界了！”
    我们怕耽误他们休息，打算以后再谈。马小六说：“不着急，休息的时间多着呢，党非常关心工人的健康，老让我们多休息，其实我们身体都很棒，我们好几个人二年来没生过病请过假。”我不知怎么一时?人忧天，问道：“如今劳逸结合，八小时生产不准延长，你们大战12月份能完成任务吗？”马小六的脸容立时现出一种叫人不能不信的神态，说：“怎么不能？还有提前的把握呢！完成任务不靠延长时间，靠动脑筋，靠百倍干劲。劳逸结合嘛，逸是为了劳，所以咱们休息时间好好休息，养精蓄锐，准备下次战斗。列宁不是说过吗，会休息的人才会更好地劳动。一到生产时候，咱们就抓紧时间，时间就是钢，分秒必争！”接着他就详细谈到他们组的最近生产情况，比前些时候又有稳定的增长了。并且津津有味地谈到怎样多炼、快炼、炼好和保护炉子的许多技术问题。他谈得那么通俗，还常常插进一些生动的譬喻，听得我们这些外行也感到津津有味了。
    我们回到石景山钢铁公司的招待所的时候，已经是黄昏时分了。坐在石景山半山腰的亭子里，纵览石钢全景，仿佛面对一幅巨大的瑰丽多彩、气象万千而又活动着的油画。你看！红烟弥漫，镶着黑边，从林立的高炉、焦炉、鼓风炉、转炉的烟囱里一团一团冒出来，散到暮色苍茫的钢铁城的上空，变成朵朵彩云晚霞，乘风飘去；下面火车、汽车穿梭往来，呜呜叫着；高大的厂房鳞次栉比，里面一群群马达发出巨大的吼声，震得山摇地动。一刹那，万灯齐明，星星点点，与烟云交辉，不夜的钢铁城更加辉煌了。这时候，谁都会想到：创造这幅奇异的油画的，不是哪位画家，正是那些智勇双全、日夜奋战在钢铁战线上的劳动者们。他们，尤其是马小六和像他一样的一代新人，正在这大战最后一个月的时间里，用创造性的劳动给这幅油画增添着几笔更加瑰丽的色彩。
