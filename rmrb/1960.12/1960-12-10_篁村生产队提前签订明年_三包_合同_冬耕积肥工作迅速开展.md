(Our newspaper from Guangzhou, 9th) The Huangcun Production Team of Fucheng Commune in Dongguan County, Guangdong Province, conscientiously implemented the Party's policies, relied on the masses, and formulated next year's "Three Guarantees" plan ahead of schedule, greatly promoting various tasks.

In the process of Huangcun Production Team's consultation with the smaller teams regarding guaranteeing output, guaranteeing workdays, and guaranteeing costs, the process generally went smoothly due to the experience and foundation accumulated in recent years, with more discussion focused on the guaranteed output. Since the Great Leap Forward, large-scale farmland capital construction has been carried out, and the land area and farming conditions have undergone great changes. For example, 350 mu of single-cropping land in shallow sandy areas and large ponds have been transformed into double-cropping land due to the improvement of the drainage and irrigation systems; over 550 mu of drought-prone upland fields in five smaller teams have been freed from drought due to the construction of mountain ponds and reservoirs. However, some smaller teams have experienced a reduction in planting area due to the occupation of land by farmland capital construction. Therefore, the "Three Guarantees" professional team of Huangcun Production Team went deep into the fields to verify and determine the yield per mu. In this way, both the area and the yield were confirmed, and the guaranteed output targets set accordingly had a reliable basis.

After each smaller team calculated the total output and output per unit area they contracted for, they felt that the targets were reasonable.

After the "Three Guarantees" were implemented in Huangcun Production Team, some small team cadres and experienced farmers raised the issue of the production command authority of the small teams. At this time, the Party Branch immediately delineated the authority of the production team and the small teams, fixed the labor force, land, draught animals, and farm tools for use by the small teams, and announced that no one should transfer them at will. When teams organized labor cooperation, it had to be voluntary, mutually beneficial, and based on payment according to labor. At the same time, it was also announced that the small teams, on the premise of ensuring the completion of the guaranteed output task, had the right to plant crops according to local conditions, the right to formulate technical measures, and the right to arrange various farm work. In this way, the small teams were satisfied and conscientiously formulated next year's production plan. At the same time, they formulated production technical measures for various crops according to local conditions and arranged current farm work. They immediately carried out deep ploughing on fertile and riverside fields, which would be beneficial to the growth of rice in the coming spring. Each small team adopted different treatments according to local conditions in the selection of varieties and planting specifications based on the different paddy fields. All agricultural production increase technical measures of each small team were discussed by the commune members and formulated jointly.

The "Three Guarantees" plan for next year of the Huangcun Production Team was discussed and approved by the general meeting of all commune members and contracts were signed. Subsequently, a competition was launched between small teams to exceed the guaranteed output. Now, all the draught cattle of Huangcun Production Team have been put into winter ploughing. In order to ensure that each mu of paddy field has 100 dan of base fertilizer next spring, all small teams have assigned special personnel to accumulate and produce fertilizer. Some small teams have added toilets on the roadsides and improved cattle pens and pigsties; some small teams have sent people and boats to the county and provincial capitals to find and transport fertilizer.

More than 3,100 mu of wheat land in the entire management district has been watered once, with 30 jin of chemical fertilizer and 8,000 jin of manure applied per mu, striving for a bumper wheat harvest next year.

    篁村生产队提前签订明年“三包”合同
    冬耕积肥工作迅速开展
    本报广州9日电　广东省东莞县附城公社篁村生产队，认真执行党的政策，依靠群众，提早制订了明年的“三包”方案，大大推进了各种工作。
    篁村生产队在和小队协商包产、包工、包成本的过程中，由于有了近几年的经验和基础，一般进行得很顺利，只是对包产问题讨论较多。由于大跃进以来，大规模地进行了农田基本建设，土地面积和耕作条件起了很大变化。如浅沙、大塘的三百五十亩单造田，因为改善了排灌系统，变成了双造田；五个小队有五百五十多亩受旱的高岗田，由于兴建了山塘水库而解除了旱患。但是也有的小队因农田基本建设占用而减少了种植面积。因此，篁村生产队的“三包”专业组深入田间进行核实，定出每亩产量。这样，面积和产量都落实了，据此订出的包产指标也就有了可靠的基础。
    各小队在计算了本队承包的总产和单位面积产量以后，都觉得指标合理。
    篁村生产队落实“三包”以后，有一些小队干部和老农又提出了小队的生产指挥权问题。这时，党总支便立即划分了生产队和小队的权限，把劳动力、土地、耕畜、农具固定给小队使用，宣布任何人不得随便调用。队与队组织劳动力协作时，必须自愿两利、按劳付酬。同时，还宣布小队在保证完成包产任务的前提下，有权因地种植，有权制定技术措施，有权安排各种农活。这样，各小队心满意足，认真制定了明年的生产计划。同时，因地制宜地制定了各项作物的生产技术措施和安排当前的农活。他们对肥田和靠河的田，马上开展深耕，这样有利于明春禾稻的生长。各个小队在选用品种上、种植规格上都根据不同的稻田，因地制宜区别对待。各小队所有的农业增产技术措施，都经过社员讨论，共同商量制定。
    篁村生产队明年的“三包”方案，经全体社员大会讨论通过，并签订了合同。随后，便开展了小队与小队之间的超包产挂钩竞赛。现在，篁村生产队的全部耕牛已下田冬耕。为保证明春每亩稻田有一百担基肥，所有小队都固定专人积肥、制肥。有的小队在田头路边增设厕所，改善牛栏猪舍；有的小队派人派船到县城、省城找肥、运肥。（附图片）
    山西稷山县河津公社辛封管理区劳逸结合得好，社员们个个精力充沛，样样农活赶前。全管理区三千一百多亩麦地已普遍浇过一次水，每亩追化肥三十斤，圈肥八千斤，力争明年小麦丰产。
