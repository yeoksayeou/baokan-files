Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 7th. According to the "People's Freedom Daily" on the 6th, the Hungarian Foreign Ministry handed a note to the Austrian Minister to Hungary on the 5th, protesting the recent fierce slander campaign against the Hungarian People's Republic by Austrian newspapers.

The note stated that in this instigated smear campaign, several newspapers used extremely vile language to insult the Hungarian People's Republic, which has diplomatic relations with Austria, and some of its leaders, even demanding that Austria sever diplomatic, cultural, and economic relations with the Hungarian People's Republic. The note pointed out that this outrageous smear campaign lacks any factual basis and is clearly intended to undermine the certain degree of improvement that has recently emerged in Hungarian-Austrian relations.

The note stated that the so-called border incident on November 28, 1960, which was used as a pretext for vile attacks, did not actually occur and was merely a malicious fabrication. The note said that both sides had investigated the matter, and the Austrian committee eventually admitted that it was not a fact, asking the Hungarian side to consider the matter closed.

The note pointed out that Austrian Interior Minister Afritsch, three days after both sides had investigated the incident, still referred to this fabricated border incident as actually having occurred in a parliamentary statement on December 1, 1960. Afritsch's statement shows that the Austrian authorities are supporting and defending the smear campaign instigated by Austrian newspapers, which can only benefit those groups who are hostile to the improvement of relations between the two countries and seek to stir up the Cold War.

The note stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Hungarian People's Republic most resolutely protests the unfounded smear campaign against Hungary by some Austrian newspapers, as well as the attitude of certain Austrian official groups and individuals which is inconsistent with the relations between the two countries.

    匈牙利外交部照会奥地利驻匈公使
    抗议奥地利对匈牙利诽谤活动
    新华社布达佩斯7日电　据《人民自由报》6日报道：匈牙利外交部5日交给奥地利驻匈公使一份照会，抗议最近奥地利报纸对匈牙利人民共和国进行的激烈的诽谤活动。
    照会说，在这一煽动起来的污蔑运动中，有几家报纸以极其恶劣的词句侮辱同奥地利有外交关系的匈牙利人民共和国和它的一些领导人，甚至要求奥地利同匈牙利人民共和国断绝外交、文化和经济关系。照会指出，这一令人愤怒的污蔑运动缺乏任何实际根据，它显然是想破坏在匈奥国家关系中最近出现的一定程度上的改善。
    照会说，作为进行恶劣攻击借口的所谓的1960年11月28日边境事件，实际上并没有发生，这只不过是恶意的凭空捏造而已。照会说，双方曾对这件事进行了检查，最后奥方委员会也承认这不是事实，要求匈方把这件事看作是已经结束了的问题。
    照会指出，奥地利内政部长阿弗里奇在双方对这次事件进行了检查的三天后竟仍然在1960年12月1日的国会声明中把这一捏造出来的边境事件说成是真正发生过的，阿弗里奇的声明表明，奥地利官方对奥地利报纸所煽起的污蔑运动进行支持和辩护，这只能对那些敌视两国关系改善和力求煽起冷战的集团有利。
    照会说，匈牙利人民共和国外交部最坚决地抗议一部分奥地利报纸进行的毫无根据的对匈牙利的污蔑活动，以及某些奥地利官方集团和人士的不符合于两国关系的态度。
