    Supporting Key Points is Supporting the Overall Situation
    Wang Pu
    In order to complete and overfulfill the 1960 industrial production plan centered on steel ahead of schedule, enterprises and localities with coal and iron outward transfer tasks, while continuing to increase coal and iron production, should continue to adhere to the principle of prioritizing external needs over internal ones, and prioritizing key points over general areas, transferring more coal and iron to key steel enterprises to effectively guarantee the needs of key enterprises for substantial production increases. This is a commendable spirit of viewing the entire country as a single chessboard. To complete and overfulfill this year's national plan requires promoting this spirit, and it will always be necessary to promote this spirit in the long-term socialist construction in the future.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said, "When we make plans, do things, and think about problems, we must proceed from the fact that our country has a population of 600 million, and we must never forget this." ("On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People") Proceeding from the 600 million population means proceeding from the fundamental and long-term interests of the people of the whole country. When a department, a locality, or a unit considers problems in this way, it is called having a global perspective. Only proceeding from the interests and needs of a department, a locality, or a unit is called a local perspective. Following a local perspective, in the long run and fundamentally, is not conducive to the overall situation nor to the local area.
    The overall situation is higher than the local situation, and the overall situation commands the local situation. However, the overall situation is not abstract, but composed of various local parts. The relationship between the local and the overall is often expressed through the relationship between local parts. Each local part has a certain effect on the overall situation. However, because the overall situation has different central tasks in different periods and needs to solve different major contradictions, and also because the specific conditions of each local part are different, the role of each local part on the overall situation is also different in a certain period, some larger, some smaller; some have a decisive effect on the success or failure of the overall situation, and some are not like this. That is to say, from the overall situation to measure each local part, there are distinctions between key and general, primary and secondary, urgent and slow, and first and last. Taking the development of the national economy, agriculture is the foundation, and industry is the leading factor. "Foundation" and "leading" are the distinctions. In industry, "taking steel as the key link," when the key link is grasped, everything else falls into place. Steel's position in industry is different from other industries. When uniformly arranging basic construction projects, this distinction must be considered. When uniformly arranging social labor, and uniformly allocating raw materials and other important materials, this distinction must also be considered. Although the distinction is only relative, what is secondary today may become primary tomorrow, but in a certain period and under certain conditions, this distinction is indispensable. Without distinction, without emphasis, it is equivalent to having no policy.
    Therefore, when leading comrades of a department, a locality, or a unit are in a local position to deal with problems, they must correctly handle the relationship between their local part and other local parts, first of all, the relationship with key departments, key regions, and key units. For example, at present, what the industrial sector must first correctly handle is its relationship with agriculture; within the industrial sector, the various departments of machinery, power generation, textile, chemical industry, etc., must first correctly handle their relationship with key industries such as coal and steel. Within the steel industry, general enterprises must first correctly handle their relationship with key enterprises. The success or failure of the key points determines the fate of the overall situation. Correctly handling the relationship between the general and the key points is correctly handling the relationship between the local and the overall situation. Serving the key points is serving the overall situation. Local needs must be subordinate to the overall needs, which is the principle of socialist democratic centralism. Correctly handling the relationship between the general and the key points means consciously putting the needs of the key points first and actively supporting them.
    Agriculture is the key point of our national economy, and all departments must actively support agriculture. In industrial production, steel, coal, and transportation are the key points. In steel and coal production, key steel enterprises and key coal mines are the key points. In transportation, railways and ships are the key points. Striving to complete and overfulfill this year's steel, coal, and transportation plans, which are directly and closely related to them, ahead of schedule, is the fundamental interest of the people of the whole country. In the ten or so days before the end of the year, localities and enterprises with coal and iron outward transfer tasks must make persistent efforts, hold high the red flag of supporting key enterprises and key regions, and strive to complete and overfulfill the coal and iron outward transfer plans ahead of schedule. It is necessary to continue to promote the spirit of viewing the whole country as a single chessboard, prioritizing external needs over internal ones, and prioritizing key points over general areas, and transfer more coal to steel plants, railways, ships, and power plants! Transfer more iron to key steelmaking enterprises!

### 支援重点就是支援全局

    支援重点就是支援全局
    王朴
    为了提前完成和超额完成以钢为中心的1960年工业生产计划，有煤、铁外调任务的企业和地方，在继续增产煤、增产铁的同时，继续本着先外后内、先重点后一般的原则，给重点钢铁企业多调煤、多调铁，切实保证重点企业大幅度增产的需要。这是可贵的全国一盘棋的精神。完成和超额完成今年国家计划需要发扬这种精神，在今后长期的社会主义建设中，也永远需要发扬这种精神。
    毛泽东同志说：“我们作计划、办事、想问题，都要从我国有六亿人口这一点出发，千万不要忘记这一点。”（《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》）从六亿人口这一点出发，就是从全国人民的根本的长远的利益出发。一个部门、一个地方、一个单位这样考虑问题，就叫做有全局观点。只从一个部门、一个地方、一个单位的利益和需要出发，就叫做局部观点。按照局部观点办事，从长远看，从根本看，既不利于全局、也不利于局部。
    全局高于局部，全局统率局部。但是，全局不是抽象的，而是由各个局部组成的。局部和全局的关系，往往通过局部与局部之间的关系表现出来。每一个局部，对全局都有一定的作用。但是，由于全局在不同时期有着不同的中心任务，需要解决不同的主要矛盾，也由于各个局部的具体情况有所不同，所以，在一定时期内，各个局部对全局的作用也就不一样，有的大些，有的小些；有的对全局的成败具有决定性的作用，有的就不是这样。也就是说，从全局来衡量各个局部，就有重点和一般、主要和次要、急和缓、先和后的区别。拿发展国民经济来讲，农业是基础，工业是主导，“基础”和“主导”就是区别。在工业中，“以钢为纲”，纲举目张，钢在工业中的地位就与别的工业不同。在统一安排基本建设项目的时候，要考虑这种区别，在统一安排社会劳动力、统一分配原材料和其他重要物资的时候，也必须考虑这种区别。虽然区别只是相对的，今天是次要的，到了明天可能变为主要的，然而，在一定的时间内和一定的条件下这种区别却是不可缺少的。没有区别，没有重点，就等于没有政策。
    因此，当一个部门、一个地方、一个单位的领导同志居于局部地位处理问题的时候，就是要正确处理自己局部与别的局部，首先是与重点部门、重点地区、重点单位的关系。例如在当前，工业部门首先要正确处理的，就是自己与农业的关系；在工业内部的机械、发电、纺织、化工等的各个部门，首先要正确处理的，就是自己与煤炭、钢铁等重点工业的关系。在钢铁工业内部，一般企业首先要正确处理的，就是自己与重点企业的关系。重点的成败决定着全局的命运。正确处理一般与重点的关系，就是正确处理局部与全局的关系。为重点就是为全局。局部需要服从全局需要，这是社会主义民主集中制的原则。正确处理一般与重点的关系，就是自觉地将重点需要摆在第一位，积极地支援它。
    农业是我国国民经济的重点，各个部门必须积极支援农业。在工业生产中，钢铁、煤炭和交通运输是重点。在钢铁和煤炭生产中，重点钢铁企业和重点煤矿是重点。在交通运输中，铁路和轮船是重点。力争提前完成和超额完成今年的钢铁、煤和跟它们有直接的密切关系的交通运输计划，是全国人民的根本利益。在年底以前十多天中，有煤、铁外调任务的地方和企业，要再接再厉，把支援重点企业、重点地区的红旗高高地举起来，力争提前和超额完成煤、铁外调计划。要继续发扬先外后内、先重点后一般的全国一盘棋精神，给钢铁厂、铁路、轮船和发电厂，调更多的煤！给重点炼钢企业调更多的铁！
