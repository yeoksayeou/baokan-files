Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, December 30th – The Fushun Mining Bureau, which has achieved comprehensive leaps forward for two consecutive years by tapping into the internal potential of the enterprise, overfulfilled its annual production plan three days ahead of schedule in 1960, with basically no new mines or production equipment added. As of December 28th, raw coal production exceeded the plan by more than 28,000 tons, and tunneling footage exceeded the national plan by 3.5%. From January to November, the overall labor productivity of the bureau increased by more than 11% compared with the national plan, and pit prop consumption decreased by 20% compared with the national plan.

With the improvement of mining capacity, the Longfeng Mine, Shengli Mine, and Laohutai Mine, etc., under the Mining Bureau, gradually shifted from shallow mining to deep mining this year. Therefore, the auxiliary workload increased, bringing a series of difficulties to transportation, hoisting, ventilation, drainage, roadway maintenance, and other links. The Fushun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Mining Area Party Committee, firmly grasped these links and mobilized the vast number of employees from the beginning of the year, focusing on improving the comprehensive production capacity of the mines, and launched a technical innovation and technical revolution movement. The employees successfully created more than 1,000 small machines, freeing or reducing the heavy physical labor of more than 12,000 workers. Coal miners in Longfeng, Laohutai, and Shengli coal mines also comprehensively promoted the advanced experience of the first shift of the sixth mining district of Laohutai Mine in improving coal mining efficiency, so that the average monthly progress of the entire mine's coal mining face in the first half of the year increased by more than 19% compared with the same period last year. A series of technical transformations have also been carried out in the weak links of underground transportation, hoisting, ventilation, drainage, and filling in these three coal mines. After the Shengli Coal Mine's mining area was fully equipped with belt conveyor transportation, the mine's transportation capacity was more than doubled, solving the contradiction that transportation could not keep up with production. Longfeng Mine implemented multi-pipe filling, increased grate holes, and changed the slope of the quicksand ditch, so that the hourly quicksand flow rate increased by about 50%, strengthening the weak link of filling. The Laohutai Mine and Longfeng Mine washing plants, after process reforms, realized the method of graded washing, which increased the washing capacity of raw coal by one time compared with the design capacity.

The Xilutian Coal Mine under the Mining Bureau summarized and sorted out a set of ten innovation projects centered on reforming the development method from more than 20,000 innovation suggestions put forward by employees, and adopted the method of fighting annihilation battles to realize and consolidate them item by item, which greatly improved the production capacity. Without increasing personnel and equipment, this open-pit mine not only completed the annual plan ahead of schedule, but also overproduced more than 668,000 tons of raw coal for the country.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 30th – On December 24th, the workers of Tianjin No. 3 Steel Plant finished smelting the last furnace of steel in this year's annual plan. This year, the plant's steel output increased by 57.15% compared with last year, the qualified rate of steel averaged 97.75%, an increase of 4.59% compared with last year, the consumption of pig iron per ton of steel decreased by 14.6% compared with last year, and the variety of steel increased by more than one time compared with the national plan, equivalent to fifteen times the total for the whole of last year.

This year, in the plan to achieve a comprehensive leap forward in the Third Steel Plant, leading cadres first constantly improved their leadership style, going deep into workshops, groups, and furnace platforms to lead production, and discussing with workers to solve various problems in the plant. The story of Party Secretary Sun Kuaiyuan's "a broom and a bowl of soup" is circulating among the workers of the Third Steel Plant. The story is like this: The bricklaying workers were in great need of a broom, but the cadres in charge of this matter thought that a broom was a small matter and forgot to solve it. Once, Sun Kuaiyuan chatted with the bricklaying workers and talked about this matter. It turned out that the workers wanted this broom to sweep the dust between the ingot mold and the chassis to avoid steel running accidents. Sun Kuaiyuan immediately asked the administrative department to solve it. The bowl of soup happened one night. When the night shift workers got off work that day, the weather was very cold, so Sun Kuaiyuan went down to the kitchen and made a bowl of hot soup for each worker with the cooks. The leading cadres' earnest solution to the specific problems in production and concern for the lives of the workers greatly encouraged the workers' enthusiasm. The workers overcame many difficulties in all aspects of steelmaking production. For example, the abnormal production of the iron-making furnace after the new furnace was opened was a key factor affecting the increase in steel production. Under the leadership of the workshop cadres, the group leaders and workers took the initiative to organize, concentrated the operational advantages of each group, and formulated an operational plan for the production of the new iron-making furnace, which quickly improved the efficiency of iron-making and met the needs of the converter steelmaking for molten iron. The converter steelmaking workers also learned from the example of the iron-making furnace workers, summarized the technical operating experience of the new converter furnace, and increased the steel production of the converter.

    抚顺矿务局原煤超产
    津钢三厂新钢种增加十四倍
    本报抚顺30日电　连续两年依靠挖掘企业内部潜力实现全面跃进的抚顺矿务局，1960年在基本上没有增加新建矿井、生产设备的条件下，又提前三天超额完成了全年的生产计划。到12月28日，原煤产量超过计划两万八千多吨，掘进进尺超过国家计划3.5％。1至11月全局劳动生产率比国家计划提高11％以上，坑木消耗比国家计划降低20％。
    随着开采能力的提高，这个矿务局所属的龙凤矿、胜利矿和老虎台矿等，今年从浅部开采逐渐移向纵深部开采，因此，辅助工作量增加，给运输、提升、通风、排水、巷道维护等环节，带来了一系列的困难。中共抚顺市委和矿区党委，紧紧抓住这些环节，从年初就发动广大职工，以提高矿井综合生产能力为中心，开展了技术革新和技术革命运动，职工们创制成功一千多件小型机具，使一万二千多名工人摆脱或减轻了笨重体力劳动。龙凤、老虎台和胜利等煤矿的采煤工人，还全面推广了老虎台矿采煤六区一班提高采煤效率的先进经验，从而使上半年全矿采煤工作面平均月进度比去年同期提高了19％以上。这三个煤矿的井下运输、提升、通风、排水、充填等薄弱环节，也进行了一系列的技术改造。胜利煤矿采区全部实现用皮带运输以后，矿井运输能力提高一倍多，解决了运输跟不上生产的矛盾。龙凤矿实行了多管充填，加大篦孔，改变流砂沟坡度等措施，使每小时流砂量提高了50％左右，加强了充填这一薄弱环节。老虎台矿和龙凤矿洗选厂经过工艺流程改革，实现了分级入洗的办法，使洗选原煤的能力比设计能力增加一倍。
    这个矿务局所属的西露天煤矿，从职工提出的两万多件革新建议中，归纳、整理出一套以改革开拓方法为中心的十个革新项目，并且采取打歼灭战的方法，逐项实现，逐项巩固，大大提高了生产能力，在没有增加人员、设备的条件下，这个露天矿不仅提前完成了全年计划，而且又为国家超产原煤六十六万八千多吨。
    据新华社天津30日电　12月24日，天津第三钢厂职工炼完了今年全年计划中的最后一炉钢水。今年，全厂钢产量比去年增长57.15％，钢的合格率平均达到97.75％，比去年提高4.59％，每吨钢的生铁消耗量比去年降低14.6％，钢的品种比国家计划增加了一倍多，相当于去年全年的十五倍。
    今年，第三钢厂在实现全面跃进的计划中，领导干部首先不断改进自己的领导作风，深入车间、小组、炉台，领导生产，同工人一起商量解决全厂的各种问题。第三钢厂工人中流传着党委书记孙魁元的“一把条帚和一碗汤”的故事。事情是这样：卧砖工人很需要一把条帚，可是管这事的干部认为一把条帚是件小事情，忘了解决。有一次，孙魁元同卧砖工人一起谈天，谈起了这件事。原来工人要这把条帚是用来扫钢锭模和底盘之间的灰尘，避免发生跑钢事故。孙魁元立刻让行政部门给解决了。一碗汤的事是发生在一天的夜晚，那天夜班工人下班的时候，天气很冷，孙魁元就下到厨房，和炊事员一起给工人们每人做了一碗热汤。领导干部认真解决生产中的具体问题和关心职工生活的作风，大大鼓舞了工人们的干劲。工人们克服了炼钢生产各个环节上许多的困难。例如，化铁炉新开炉生产不正常，是影响钢产量提高的一个关键。各炉的组长和工人在车间干部的领导下，就主动组织起来，把各个组的操作优点集中起来，制订了化铁炉新开炉生产的操作方案，很快就提高了化铁的效率，满足了转炉炼钢用铁水的需要。转炉炼钢工人又学习了化铁炉工人的榜样，总结了转炉新开炉的技术操作经验，提高了转炉的钢产量。
