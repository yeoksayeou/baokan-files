(Our Dispatch from Yinchuan, December 27th) The Starfire Brigade (basic accounting unit) of the Baofeng Commune in Shizuishan City, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, has correctly handled the relationship between the brigade, teams, and commune members, achieving comprehensive development in animal husbandry. Since communization, the brigade has seen a net increase of 30.1% in large livestock, a net increase of four times in pigs, and net increases of one to dozens of times in sheep, chickens, and rabbits.

Actively developing breeding bases at the brigade level is the position and material foundation for the high-speed development of animal husbandry in the Starfire Brigade. Since last year, the brigade has relied on its own economic strength and the draught animals and livestock and poultry left by the advanced cooperative to establish breeding bases for cattle, mules, horses, camels, pigs, sheep, rabbits, and more. This year, the thirty-plus female donkeys in the mule and horse breeding base, after careful management, finally broke the convention, achieving a conception rate of 100%; the cows and camels all conceived, gave birth, and survived healthy and strong. In the past two years, the various breeding bases have produced more than 120 large livestock and thousands of livestock and poultry.

Since communization, the Starfire Brigade has also implemented a system of fixing draught animals for the use of the teams, and has always adhered to the principle of "whoever breeds, uses," never arbitrarily transferring a draught animal from one team to another. The brigade also actively helps the teams with breeding. During the spring planting this year, ten cows in the Seventh Team were pregnant and unable to do heavy work. The brigade transferred three mules and two horses from the transportation team to support them. For weak calves, the brigade also allocated soybean cakes to the team for supplementary feeding. As a result, the team's large livestock has increased year after year.

In developing the livestock and poultry breeding industry of the teams, the brigade sells its own bred piglets, sheep, rabbits, and chickens to the canteens, constantly developing the canteens' household production. Currently, all nineteen canteens in the brigade have established small rabbit farms and chicken farms. Han Chinese canteens all raise pigs, and Hui canteens all raise sheep.

In order to change the previous habits of commune members here not raising pigs, sheep, and poultry, the brigade and teams have taken various measures to provide commune members with many conveniences. In addition to leaving enough private plots for commune members as required, the prices of piglets, ewes, and rabbits sold by the brigade to commune members are generally slightly lower than market prices. As it is inconvenient for individual households to graze sheep, the teams adopt a system of trusteeship or organize commune members to cooperate in grazing on the basis of mutual benefit. The Starfire Brigade has always encouraged commune members to raise a small number of pigs, sheep, and poultry, which are completely controlled by the commune members themselves, under the premise of not affecting collective labor, in accordance with the Party's policies. As a result, every family in the commune raises chickens, every household raises rabbits, Hui commune members raise an average of one sheep per household, and many Han commune members raise pigs this year.

In correctly handling the relationship between the brigade, teams, and commune members, the Party branch, through calculating economic and political accounts, repeatedly clarified to the commune members the significance of developing livestock and poultry breeding. At the same time, through various meetings, individual talks, and evaluations, it further strengthened the political and ideological education of the breeders. The more enthusiastic the breeders are, the more the Party branch cares about their lives, taking care of them in all aspects of food, clothing, and housing. In addition, the "three guarantees and one reward" system of "guaranteed fatness, guaranteed breeding, and guaranteed survival" was implemented for breeders. Due to the consistent implementation and timely realization of the "three guarantees and one reward," a competition climax of managing and breeding livestock and poultry well has been formed throughout the brigade.

Currently, in order to protect the livestock and ensure a safe winter, the Starfire Brigade Party branch has promptly organized forces, led by brigade-level cadres, to go deep into the sheds and pens, conduct inspections on a head-by-head basis, and rank them according to their fatness. All pregnant livestock and a few weak livestock are stopped from being used and are given additional fodder as supplementary feed.

    建立繁殖基地支援小队、社员发展家畜家禽
    星火大队猪羊鸡兔全面增产
    本报银川27日电　宁夏回族自治区石咀山市宝丰公社星火大队（基本核算单位），正确地处理了大队、小队和社员三者的关系，养殖业获得全面发展。这个队从公社化以来，大家畜净增30.1％，猪净增四倍，羊、鸡、兔分别净增一倍到数十倍。
    积极发展大队一级的繁殖基地，是星火大队高速度发展养殖业的阵地和物质基础。从去年以来，大队依靠自己的经济力量和高级社留下的耕畜和家畜家禽，建立了耕牛、骡马、骆驼、猪、羊、兔等繁殖基地。今年骡马繁殖基地的三十多头母驴，经过精心管理，终于打破常规，受胎率达到100％；母牛和母驼都是全怀、全产、全活、全壮。两年来，各繁殖基地繁殖的大家畜就有一百二十多头，家畜家禽数以千计。
    星火大队从公社化以来，还实行了耕畜固定给小队使用，并且始终坚持了谁繁殖谁使用的原则，从来没有随便调过小队一头耕畜。大队也积极帮助小队进行繁殖。今年春播时，七小队十头母牛怀了胎，不能干重活。大队就从运输专业队抽调三匹骡子、两匹马前来支援。对于瘦弱的牛犊，大队还拨出豆饼给小队补喂。所以这个小队的大家畜年年增加。
    在发展小队家畜家禽饲养业中，大队用自己繁殖的仔猪、羊、兔、鸡卖给食堂，不断发展食堂的家底生产。目前，全队十九个食堂都建立了小型兔场和鸡场，汉民食堂都养了猪，回民食堂都养了羊。
    为了改变这里社员以往没有养猪、羊和家禽的习惯，大队和小队采取各种措施给予社员不少便利条件。除了按规定给社员留足自留地外，大队卖给社员的仔猪、母羊和兔子等的价格，一般都稍低于市价。一家一户放羊不方便，小队采取代管或在互利的基础上组织社员协作放牧。星火大队始终根据党的政策，鼓励社员在不影响集体劳动的前提下，饲养少量的猪、羊和家禽，并完全由社员自己支配。这样，今年社员家家养鸡，户户养兔，回民社员平均每户养一只羊，不少汉民社员养了猪。
    在正确处理大队、小队和社员三者的关系中，党总支通过算经济账和政治账，反复向社员讲清发展家畜家禽饲养业的意义。同时，通过各种会议，个别谈心，评比检查，进一步加强对饲养人员的政治思想教育。饲养人员干劲越高，党总支对他们的生活越关心，从吃、穿、住各方面都加以照顾。此外，对饲养人员还实行了“包膘分、包繁殖、包成活”的三包一奖制度。由于“三包一奖”的坚持贯彻和及时兑现，在全队形成了一种管好和繁殖家畜家禽的竞赛高潮。
    目前，为了保护牲畜安度严冬，星火大队党总支及时组织力量，由大队负责干部带领，深入棚圈，逐头进行检查，并根据膘分进行了排队。对于怀胎的母畜和少数弱畜，都一律停止使役，并增加草料补喂。
