Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: The Japan Association for the Promotion of the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Trade sent a call on November 29 to 10,000 trading companies throughout Japan, urging them to make efforts to prompt the Japanese government to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and sign a trade agreement with the Chinese government.

The call expressed support for Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's talks on Sino-Japanese relations and pointed out that the conditions proposed by China regarding Sino-Japanese trade are consistent with the demands of Japanese business people who hope to restore Sino-Japanese trade.

The call emphasized that the healthy development of Sino-Japanese trade depends entirely on whether the Japanese government strives to establish normal peaceful diplomatic relations with China.

The call also stated that Sino-Japanese trade can only be developed according to long-term and stable plans on the basis of a trade agreement between governments.

The call concluded, "If we in the business community pass resolutions at all our meetings and use every possible opportunity to work together to put pressure on local and central governments, we will definitely be able to force the government to agree to our demands and conclude a trade agreement between governments with China."

Xinhua News Agency, November 30th, Tokyo: The Central Executive Committee of the Japan Socialist Party passed a current activity policy at its meeting today. The policy stipulates that the Socialist Party will launch a national movement demanding the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and the conclusion of a trade agreement between the governments of China and Japan.

The Socialist Party's activity policy also stipulates the launching of a broad national movement to force the Ikeda Cabinet to change its current reactionary policies and to strive for the establishment of a coalition government that upholds the Constitution, democracy, and neutrality. The policy also stipulates that the Socialist Party should strive to develop organizations in rural areas.

Acting Chairman Eda Saburo of the Socialist Party said at the meeting that the policies pursued by the Ikeda Cabinet are heading towards failure due to the U.S. economic crisis. He said, "Moreover, the Ikeda Cabinet has been greatly weakened because many Liberal Democratic Party Diet members in rural areas oppose Ikeda's agricultural policies." He called on all members of the Socialist Party to unite closely and expand their influence among the people to fight to overthrow the Ikeda Cabinet.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: According to the Japan Council of Trade Unions' organ newspaper "Sohyo," 83% of union members in Japan firmly oppose the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. The weekly said this was the result of a recent opinion poll conducted by this national trade union federation of 20,000 union members in various industries.

    全国百分之八十以上工会会员坚决反对日美条约
    新华社讯　东京消息：日本恢复日中贸易促进委员会11月29日向日本各地一万家贸易公司发出呼吁书，要求它们作出努力，促使日本政府恢复日中邦交和同中国政府签订贸易协定。
    呼吁书表示支持中国总理周恩来关于日中关系的谈话，并且指出，中国提出的关于日中贸易的条件同希望恢复日中贸易的日本贸易界人士的要求是一致的。
    呼吁书着重指出，日中贸易的健康发展完全取决于日本政府是否努力同中国建立正常的和平外交关系。
    呼吁书又说，只有在政府之间的贸易协定的基础上，日中贸易才有可能按照长期的稳定的计划获得发展。
    呼吁书最后说，“如果我们企业界人士在我们举行的一切会议上通过决议，并且利用一切可能的机会同心协力地向地方和中央政府施加压力，我们就一定能够迫使政府答应我们的要求，并使之同中国缔结政府之间的贸易协定。”
    据新华社11月30日讯　东京消息：日本社会党中央执行委员会在今天的会议上通过当前活动方针。方针规定，社会党将展开一个国民运动，要求恢复日中邦交和缔结日中两国政府间的贸易协定。
    社会党的活动方针还规定要发动广泛的国民运动，迫使池田内阁改变现行的反动政策，为建立维护宪法、民主、中立的联合政府而斗争。方针还规定，社会党要努力在农村发展组织。
    社会党代理委员长江田三郎在会上讲话说，池田内阁奉行的政策由于美国经济危机而正在走向失败。他说，“而且由于农村地区的许多自由民主党国会议员反对池田的农业政策，池田内阁大大削弱了。”他号召社会党全体党员紧密地团结起来，并且在人民中间扩大影响，为打倒池田内阁而斗争。
    新华社讯　东京消息：据日本工会总评议会机关报《总评》报道，日本83％的工会会员坚决反对日美军事同盟条约。这家周刊说，这是这个全国性工会联合组织最近对各行业工会的两万个工会会员进行的民意测验的结果。
