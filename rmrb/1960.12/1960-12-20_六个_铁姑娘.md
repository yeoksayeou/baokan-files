Six "Iron Girls"

The story of six "Iron Girls" is circulating in Hebei Province. They are Zhang Xiumin, Zhang Xiuzhen, Zhang Qingyun, Zhang Xiuqin, and young women Shi Xiuqin and Lu Guiqin, all members of the Communist Youth League of the Xiaoyuzhuang Production Team of the Dazhongzhuang People's Commune in Hangu City.

The "Iron Girls'" hometown used to be a poor place. It is located on the banks of the Jiyun River, with low-lying terrain. Before liberation, it was often hit by floods, causing famine. The farmers here had no choice but to leave their homes and beg for food. All six "Iron Girls" were born in other villages.

However, after liberation, under the leadership and care of the Party, the six "Iron Girls" and the masses worked together. After several years of hard work, this place has completely changed. Every household in the team has more than enough grain, vegetables, firewood, fish, grass, and money. The six "Iron Girls" have many model deeds. The most prominent one is:

Last spring, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the call to learn from the spirit of the "poor stick" cooperative and for poor teams to catch up with rich teams. The Xiaoyuzhuang Party Branch immediately formulated a plan to catch up with the rich teams. At first, some people lacked confidence, saying things like "a frog in a well can't fly to the sky." However, the six "Iron Girls" firmly believed that relying on the Party and the people's commune, they would definitely be able to change the face of their hometown. They said: "The three donkey legs of the 'poor stick' cooperative can turn poverty into wealth. We have twelve donkey legs, so we can become rich more quickly." And they loudly proposed: "The frog in the well can definitely fly to the sky, and 'Huazi Camp' will definitely become a happy village." Since then, in the labor of changing the face of their hometown, they have become more active, hardworking, and courageous. This year, they have also reclaimed the team's last forty mu of wasteland and planted crops.

### 六个“铁姑娘”

    六个“铁姑娘”
    在河北省流传着六个“铁姑娘”的故事。她们是汉沽市大中庄人民公社小于庄生产队的共青团员张秀敏、张秀珍、张庆云、张秀芹和青年妇女石秀芹、卢桂芹。
    “铁姑娘”的家乡，过去是个穷地方。它位于蓟运河畔，地势低洼。解放前，常遭洪水，造成灾荒，这里的农民只得离乡背井，逃荒要饭。六个“铁姑娘”，个个都是出生在外乡。
    可是解放后，在党的领导和关怀下，六个“铁姑娘”和群众一起，经过几年的努力生产，这个地方完全变了样，全队家家户户实现了粮、菜、柴、鱼、草、钱六有余。六个“铁姑娘”的模范事迹多得很，其中最突出的一件是：
    去年春天，中共河北省委提出学习“穷棒子”办社精神，穷队赶上富队的号召。小于庄党支部立即订出了赶富队计划。起初，有的人信心不足，说什么“井底蛤蟆飞不上天”。但是，六个“铁姑娘”坚信：依靠党，依靠人民公社，一定能够改变家乡的面貌。他们说：“穷棒子社三条驴腿能够由穷变富，我们有十二条驴腿，就更能够迅速变富”。并且响亮地提出：“井底蛤蟆一定能够飞上天，‘花子营’一定能变成幸福庄”。从此，在改变家乡面貌的劳动中，她们更加积极努力勇往直前。今年又开垦全队最后四十亩荒地，种上了庄稼。
