    Zunyi Changzheng Commune, Changzheng Production Team, Fifth Small Team
    Actively Plants Scallions, Garlic, Ginger and Other Seasoning Vegetables

    (Our Dispatch) The Fifth Small Team of the Changzheng Production Team of the Changzheng Commune in Zunyi City, Guizhou Province, while vigorously developing large-scale "staple vegetables," is actively planting small-scale seasoning vegetables and supplementary vegetables, to meet the needs of urban residents' vegetable consumption in many ways.
    In winter vegetable production, this small team initially only paid attention to planting large-scale vegetables such as cabbage and turnips, which require less labor, are easy to manage, have high yields, and generate more income. It did not produce enough seasoning and supplementary vegetables, and therefore could not fully meet the needs of urban people's lives. Under the specific leadership of the Party branch, the small team committee repeatedly studied the municipal party committee's instructions on developing winter vegetable production, and unanimously realized that vegetable production should not only be large in quantity, but also strive to meet the people's requirements in terms of variety and quality. On the basis of raising awareness, the small team formed a small-scale vegetable planting management group consisting of several members with many years of experience in cultivating multiple varieties of small vegetables, and used the scattered land that had always been used to grow small vegetables to plant fifty-four mu of small-scale seasoning and supplementary vegetables. After more than two months of careful management, the small-scale vegetables have developed to more than thirty varieties, and have produced about 20,000 jin of spinach, cauliflower, onions, ginger, scallions, garlic, etc. since the beginning of winter alone.

    遵义长征公社长征生产队五小队
    积极种植葱蒜姜等调味菜
    本报讯　贵州遵义市长征公社长征生产队五小队在大力发展大宗的“当家菜”的同时，积极种植小宗的调味菜和辅助菜，多方面满足城市人民菜食需要。
    这个小队在冬菜生产中，开始只注意种植花工少、便于管理、产量高、收入多的白菜、萝卜等大宗蔬菜，对调味菜和辅助菜生产不多，因此不能充分满足城市人民生活需要。小队委员会在党支部的具体领导下，通过反复学习市委对发展冬季蔬菜生产的指示，一致认识到蔬菜生产不仅要数量多，同时在品种上、质量上也尽力满足人民的要求。在提高认识的基础上，小队将具有多年培植多品种小菜经验的几个社员，组成小宗菜种植管理小组，利用历来种植小菜的零星土地，栽种了五十四亩小宗的调味菜和辅助菜。经过两个多月的精心管理，小宗菜已发展到三十多个品种，仅入冬以来就生产了菠菜、花菜、洋葱、姜、葱、大蒜等两万斤左右。
