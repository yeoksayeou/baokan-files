Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 30th: The November 21st issue of "U.S. News & World Report," in its "Business Outlook" column, admitted that even after U.S. President-elect Kennedy takes office, there is no way to make "much change in the prospects" of the increasingly deteriorating U.S. business activities.

The magazine admitted that U.S. business activity is now in a "recession." It said, "This recession began a few months ago in the housing construction and steel industries, and it has gradually spread to other industries, largely reflected in reduced purchases by businesses for inventory, declining residential construction, and falling sales of furniture and other durable goods." It said, "The current situation will not be greatly affected by any measures taken by the new president."

The magazine estimates that the U.S. gross national product in the third quarter of this year decreased by about 0.5% compared to the second quarter. The output of factories, mines, and utilities is currently down 4% from January. The magazine said that the current decline in production in the United States is expected to continue into next year.

The magazine said that in order to alleviate the economic crisis, the U.S. government is already increasing spending to stimulate production. At the same time, "the new government also plans to increase defense," that is, to strengthen activities of arms expansion and war preparation to stimulate the economy. However, the magazine admits that even these artificial measures cannot solve the chronic diseases of the U.S. capitalist economy. The Kennedy administration "will face two long-standing (unsolvable) problems, namely unemployment and rising living costs."

The magazine predicts that "recession plus automation" "will greatly increase the number of unemployed." If past experience is anything to go by, the number of unemployed in the United States next year will reach 5.5 million.

It also said, "The cost of living will continue to rise, rising to 128.5 a year later (with 1947-49 as 100). This reflects the increase in service and utility costs."

Currently, the number of unemployed in the United States is about 3.6 million, and the cost of living reached an unprecedented high of 127.3 in October.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 30th: The U.S. Department of Commerce announced yesterday that sales and new orders for U.S. manufacturing both decreased in October.

Sales decreased by $700 million compared to September, and new orders decreased by $1.1 billion. Manufacturing inventories decreased by $400 million. Manufacturers reduced inventories of raw materials and semi-finished products, while inventories of finished products increased, indicating sluggish sales of finished products.

The Commerce Department also estimates that new construction in November was $4.8 billion, down 5% from October, and private construction spending was $3.4 billion, down 3% from October.

The report said that senior economists in the U.S. government are frustrated by these developments.

At the same time, the number of unemployed in the United States continues to grow. According to unofficial preliminary statistics, the number of unemployed in the United States in November has increased to about 4 million. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the number of people receiving unemployment benefits has increased by nearly 300,000.

Xinhua News Agency, 29th: A November 25th editorial in the U.S. "Wall Street Journal," commenting on the failure of Anderson and Dillon's trip to Europe, wrote dejectedly: "The United States must face the harsh reality that the burden of getting its house in order must fall mainly on itself."

After pointing out that West Germany holds huge foreign exchange reserves, the editorial wrote: "If Minister Anderson cannot make any real progress with the wealthy West Germans, who are the most closely linked to the United States among the European allies, then little can be expected from the less wealthy and less compliant French and British."

The newspaper helplessly believes that in order to deal with the growing U.S. international payment deficit, the United States has to find its own solutions.

A November 28th report by the Washington correspondent of the British "Times" described the ugly spectacle of mutual recrimination and quarreling among the U.S. ruling clique after Anderson and others ran into snags. It wrote: "In Washington, people have been watching Anderson and Dillon's mission with bewilderment and anger." Some words Anderson published after returning to the United States to cover up his failure "unfortunately do not work to calm the people who are criticizing here (referring to the United States)." The reporter pointed out that people in the U.S. State Department pushed the responsibility for the failure onto Anderson, while "the public does not know whether to be angry with the stubborn (West) Germans or with Mr. Anderson."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 30th: Japanese bourgeois newspapers generally feel uneasy about the United States shifting the crisis to Japan, and advocate "quickly formulating countermeasures."

"Tokyo Shimbun" said that this U.S. dollar crisis is "deep-rooted." It pointed out the possible measures the United States might take against Japan, saying: "The United States will require Japan to increase aid to underdeveloped countries, increase defense spending, repay the 'Occupied Areas Relief Fund,' the 'Occupied Areas Economic Rehabilitation Fund,' and other post-war aid funds, and promote trade liberalization, etc."

"Tokyo Shimbun" also pointed out that the measures taken by the United States to ease the dollar crisis will not only reduce Japan's annual income by 120 million U.S. dollars, but also seriously affect Japan's exports. It called on the government to quickly "formulate countermeasures" to expand Japanese exports.

The newspaper also emphasized that Japan's concessions to the United States can only be "limited." It said, "Japan has less foreign exchange than Western European countries, and considering the impact of the United States' measures to protect the dollar on Japan, Japan's cooperation with (the United States) naturally has a certain limit."

Another bourgeois newspaper, "Mainichi Shimbun," pointed out: The U.S. measures "will have a great impact on the foundation of Japan's economic policy," because the economic policy that the Ikeda Cabinet wants to implement is based on: abundant foreign exchange and a stable surplus in international balance of payments. However, due to the significant reduction in U.S. "special procurement" spending, it will be difficult for Japanese exports to expand, and trade "liberalization" will be accelerated. "Japan's international balance of payments surplus will be shaken from its foundation."

A commentary broadcast by Tokyo Broadcasting System yesterday also pointed out that the reasons for the dollar crisis are "quite deep-rooted." It said that if it develops, the impact on Japan "cannot be said to be considerable." The commentary pointed out that the United States will not only cut military "aid" to Japan, but also require Japan to increase its arms expansion burden.

    美国许多经济部门生产继续下降
    《美国新闻与世界报道》说肯尼迪上台后难以收拾日益恶化的经济局面
   东京报纸认为美元危机根深蒂固主张日本迅速拟订对策
    新华社30日讯　华盛顿消息：11月21日的一期《美国新闻与世界报道》在它的“企业展望”栏里承认，美国当选总统肯尼迪接任美国总统后也没有办法使日益恶化的美国企业活动的“前景有多大变化”。
    这家杂志承认，现在美国企业活动正处于“衰退”中。它说“这场衰退是在几个月前在房产建筑和钢铁工业中开始的，它逐渐蔓延到其他工业，在很大程度上反映为企业用作库存的购买量减少，住宅建筑下降，家具和其他耐用品销售量下降”。它说，“目前形成的局面不会因新总统的任何措施而有多大影响”。
    这家杂志估计，今年第三季度美国国民生产总值比第二季度减少了0.5％左右。工厂、矿山、公用事业的产量目前比1月份下降了4％。杂志说，美国目前的生产下跌预料在明年将继续下去。
    这家杂志说，为了缓和经济危机，美国政府已经在增加开支以刺激生产。同时，“新政府也计划要增加防务”，即加强扩军备战的活动来刺激经济。但是，这家杂志承认，即使这些人为措施也不能解决美国资本主义经济的痼疾。肯尼迪政府“将面临两个长久（不能解决）的问题，即失业和生活费用上涨”。
    杂志预料，“衰退加上自动化”“将使失业人数大大增加”。如果过去的情况可作借鉴的话，明年美国失业人数将达五百五十万。
    它还说，“生活费用也将继续上涨，在一年后上涨到一百二十八点五（以1947—49年为一百）。这反映服务和公用事业费用的增加。”
    目前美国失业人数约三百六十万左右，生活费用10月已达到空前高峰一百二十七点三。
    新华社30日讯　华盛顿消息：美国商务部昨天宣布，10月份美国制造业的销售额和新订货都下降了。
    销售额比9月份减少了七亿美元，新订货下降了十一亿美元。制造业的储存下降了四亿美元，制造商们减少了原料和半成品的储存，而制成品的存货却增加了，表明成品滞销。
    商务部还估计，11月份新建筑为四十八亿美元，比10月份下降5％，私人建筑开支为三十四亿美元，比10月份下降3％。
    消息说，美国政府的高级经济学家对这些情况感到沮丧。
    同时，美国失业人数继续增长。据非官方的初步统计，11月份美国全国失业人数大约已增加到四百万人。据美国劳工部宣布，领失业补助金的人数又增加了差不多三十万人。
    新华社29日讯　美国《华尔街日报》25日社论在评论安德逊、狄龙西欧之行的失败时沮丧地写道：“美国不得不面对严酷的现实，就是：把它的家务弄好的担子主要还得落在它自己身上”。
    社论在指出西德手中拥有巨大的外汇储备以后写道：“如果安德逊部长对殷富的、在欧洲盟国里同美国联系得最紧密的西德人都不能有任何真正的进展的话，那么从比较不那么富、不那么顺从的法国人和英国人那里就很少有可指望的了。”
    这家报纸无可奈何地认为，为了对付不断增长的美国国际支付赤字，只得靠美国自己想办法。
    英国《泰晤士报》驻华盛顿记者28日的报道，描写了美国统治集团中在安德逊等碰壁以后互相埋怨争吵的丑态。它写道：“在华盛顿，人们一直以惶惑和愤怒的心情注视着安德逊和狄龙的这次使命”。安德逊回美国后发表的掩饰他失败的一些话，“不幸对平息这里（指美国）的进行抨击的人不起作用”。记者指出，美国国务院的人把失败的责任推在安德逊身上，而“公不知道究竟是该向顽固的（西）众德国人，还是该向安德逊先生发怒”。
    新华社30日讯　东京消息：日本资产阶级报纸对于美国向日本转嫁危机普遍感到不安，并且主张“迅速拟订对策”。
  《东京新闻》说，美国这次美元危机是“根深蒂固的”。它指出美国可能对日本采取的作法说：“美国将会要求日本增加对不发达国家的援助额，增加防御费，偿还
  ‘占领地区救济基金’、‘占领地区经济复兴基金’等战后的援助资金，促进贸易自由化等等”。
    《东京新闻》还指出，美国为缓和美元危机而采取的措施不仅将使日本每年减少一亿二千万美元的收入，而且将对日本的出口发生严重影响。它要求政府赶快在扩大日本出口方面“拟订对策”。
    这家报纸还强调日本对美国的让步只能是有“限度”的，它说，“日本的外汇比西欧各国少，而且，考虑到美国保卫美元的措施对日本的影响时，日本同（美国）的合作自然就有一定限度了”。
    另一家资产阶级报纸《每日新闻》指出：美国的措施“对日本的经济政策的基础将发生很大的影响”，因为，池田内阁想要推行的经济政策的依据是：外汇多和国际收支有稳定的盈余。可是，由于美国的“特需”开支将会大大减少，日本出口难于伸展，并要加速实行贸易“自由化”，“日本国际收支的盈余就会从基础上动摇”。
    东京每日广播电台昨天广播的一篇评论，也指出美元危机的原因是“相当根深蒂固的”。它说，如果发展下去，对日本的影响“不能不说是相当大的”。评论指出，美国不但将削减对日本的军事“援助”，同时还会要求日本增加扩军负担。
