Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 23rd: TASS reported that Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko delivered a report on the international situation and Soviet foreign policy at the Sixth Session of the Supreme Soviet on December 23rd.

Gromyko said that the events in the Congo, Algeria, and Laos due to the sins of the imperialist powers "are tragedies for the people of these countries, but at the same time, they are also the prelude to their complete liberation from foreign rule and their march towards a genuine national revival."

Gromyko declared that the main direction and main characteristics determining the historical development of human society are the world socialist system and the forces engaged in the anti-imperialist struggle. The reason why the stormy fifties of the twentieth century did not lead to a third world war was that the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp, as well as the national liberation movements of various countries and the forces of peace within imperialist countries, were constantly shattering the conspiracies of the enemies of peace.

The second reason is that the economic and military strength of the socialist camp, which is developing year by year, has timely blocked the path of the aggressors.

Gromyko emphasized: "This means that in the practice of international relations, the forces of peace outweigh the forces of war!"

Minister Gromyko asserted that the faction represented by the imperialist countries in international politics is weakening year by year, withdrawing from one position after another. The Western military blocs—the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Central Treaty Organization—are all declining and tottering, and the policies of their organizers have been repeatedly defeated.

The more Western politicians clamor about the "position of strength" policy, the more pathetic and absurd their threats sound.

Gromyko declared: "The time has come when the aggressor's attempt to re-launch a world war can be stopped, and conditions are being formed that can forever exclude war from the social life of mankind. The peaceful policy of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people is precisely to achieve this goal."

Gromyko called Comrade Khrushchev's speech at the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly "an outstanding example of defending the cause of peace with the extremely great power of persuasion and influence over the people of all countries, and an example of applying Lenin's diplomatic style in modern times."

All the speeches made by the head of the Soviet government from the rostrum of the United Nations contained proposals that deeply moved the people of all countries.

Referring to the Soviet government's firm proposal at the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly to restore the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, Gromyko declared that the current session has shown that the time is not far off when China will occupy its due seat in the United Nations, which will be a major step forward in normalizing relations between countries and consolidating the cause of world peace.

The Soviet Foreign Minister called everything that happened at the UN General Assembly session "a duel between two camps and two worlds in defending their respective political and moral positions."

One camp called for the following words to be written on the banner of the United Nations: replacing frenzied war preparations with peace and complete disarmament of all countries, replacing the chains of colonialism with freedom, and replacing atomic and hydrogen bombs with schools and hospitals. The other camp actually attempted to replace disarmament with supervision of armaments, which in fact meant further spurring countries to compete in the production of the most terrible weapons, nuclear bombs, and rockets.

Referring to the question sometimes raised in the West as to what is the secret of the welcome for the Soviet government's proposals and the attractiveness of Khrushchev's speeches, Minister Gromyko said: "The answer to this question is very simple, and it lies in the truth, in the noble ideas that are the basis of our policy. The secret is that our country is not playing with disarmament and peace, but implementing a sincere policy, and it is difficult to deceive the people of all countries on this point."

After pointing out that the collapse of the colonial slavery system established by capitalism for many centuries is inevitable, Gromyko emphasized that the achievements of the national liberation movements of the African people have been particularly remarkable in recent times.

The Soviet government, faithful to the Leninist policy of respecting the national rights of all peoples, unconditionally recognizes the sovereignty of new independent states and is willing to develop relations with them on the basis of complete equality.

Gromyko emphasized that now, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries can not only morally and politically support the people of all countries striving for an independent life, but also provide them with significant material and technical assistance. He also pointed out that this assistance is based on friendly and equal agreements, without any political, military, or other conditions incompatible with the principle of respecting national sovereignty.

The Soviet Minister reiterated that the Soviet Union is not seeking any preferential conditions or privileges for itself in Africa or in other parts of the world.

The Foreign Minister announced that the Soviet government fully supports the proposal put forward by Ghanaian President Nkrumah at the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly to turn Africa into a zone free of rocket-nuclear weapons, free of testing of such weapons, and free of foreign military bases.

Referring to the situation in the Congo, "where the guardians of the colonial system are rampant today," Gromyko said that the dispersal of parliament, the kidnapping of Prime Minister Lumumba and his comrades and their humiliation are not victories for the colonialists. Gromyko added that these actions mean that the ground under the feet of those who take these actions is burning. The lesson they have taught the people of Africa and the world will not be in vain.

In the Congo, the final say does not belong to foreign plunderers, but to the people of this country, and only they have the right to be masters of the country.

Gromyko said that the actions of Hammarskjöld and his representatives in the Congo are the actions of accomplices of the colonialists. Now, it should be clear to everyone how urgent it is to reorganize the United Nations institutions, which should correctly reflect the real balance of power formed in the world. Gromyko emphasized that only in this way will the United Nations have a future as a world instrument.

Gromyko called the war waged by France against the Algerian people with the support of its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization one of the most shameful phenomena of colonial policy in our days. In stating the Soviet Union's position on the Algerian issue, he emphasized that the Algerian people should have the opportunity to decide their own destiny.

Referring to the armed intervention by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization group, led by the United States, in the Laotian people, Gromyko said that the Soviet Union firmly advocates that Laos should always be an independent and neutral country in accordance with the will of its people.

Gromyko cited Cuba as an example of how even small countries can resist imperialists and defend their independence in our time. He emphasized that the cause of Cuba has now become the banner of the patriotic forces of all Latin American countries. They have vowed not to allow this country, which is at the forefront of the national liberation struggle of the people of Latin American countries, to be destroyed.

After pointing out that the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples adopted by the United Nations General Assembly is a document of great political significance, Gromyko said that the task now is: all countries and peoples should work together to strive to fulfill this resolution of the United Nations as soon as possible.

Referring to the issue of disarmament, Gromyko said: "In order to maximize the convergence of the positions of all parties and reach an agreement as soon as possible, the Soviet government carefully considered the proposals put forward by Western countries in discussing our proposal for complete and thorough disarmament in its proposal for complete and thorough disarmament."

Referring to this, he emphasized that the Soviet government has studied with particular care those issues related to effective supervision of disarmament. Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union is prepared to accept any supervision if Western countries accept the proposal for complete and thorough disarmament. He emphasized that, however, Western countries are opposed to effective supervision. "In fact, they are not only opponents of disarmament, but also opponents of supervision of disarmament."

The Foreign Minister emphasized that the Soviet Union and neutral countries are united on the issue of disarmament. Gromyko said, "We have formed a common front with them, a front of disarmament advocates."

He said that the Western countries opposed adding five neutral countries to the Disarmament Committee, apparently fearing that these countries would see with their own eyes and experience for themselves who is hindering the discussion of the disarmament issue.

Gromyko emphasized that the Soviet government has always believed that holding a special session of the United Nations General Assembly with the participation of heads of state or government would be conducive to discussing the issue of disarmament. Gromyko went on to say that the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are countering the Soviet Union's efforts to seek ways for complete and thorough disarmament with a line of continuing to intensify the arms race. He specifically cited the recently concluded Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Group Council. Gromyko emphasized, when talking about the Norstad plan, that turning the North Atlantic Treaty Organization into a "nuclear power" actually means turning West Germany into a "nuclear power."

The Foreign Minister called it absurd that the leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization made it seem as if pressing a button with fifteen fingers would mean reducing the risk of a rocket-nuclear war breaking out. Gromyko emphasized that it can be said with certainty that the risk of war breaking out (including accidental outbreak) would increase at least fifteenfold.

Gromyko commented that the communiqué of the ministers of the fifteen countries participating in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting was "a commonplace pile of anti-Soviet and anti-communist propaganda clichés that this far from glorious organization learned from Goebbels' office." The Minister announced and added: "The policies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization go against the will of the people of all countries. It promises these countries not peace, but expanded war preparations."

Gromyko announced: "In view of the fact that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization continues to pursue an aggressive policy and plans to expand war preparations, the Soviet Union will, of course, draw due conclusions from this fact. It can be believed that our national defense will fully meet the requirements placed on it by the current international situation. The borders of the Soviet Union and all other countries of the socialist camp will be forever secured with strong and reliable locks. Once necessary, the Soviet state will devote all its strength to defending our motherland, our friends and allies."

Gromyko emphasized that the Macmillan government's agreement to build bases in Scotland for American nuclear submarines carrying nuclear warhead rockets is not in keeping with the national character of the British people's caution. He added: "Those who say that the number of foreign bases on British territory seems to have no meaning for Britain obviously do not believe that it is possible to defend peace, but hold the view that war is inevitable."

Minister Gromyko pointed out that the Soviet government has shown great patience on the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany. He said: "In the issues of Europe, this is the main issue we face together with Western countries. This is the main issue in our relations with West Germany." Concluding a peace treaty will open a new page in Soviet-West German relations. He went on to say, "The Soviet government advocates concluding a peace treaty with the two Germanies as soon as possible and making West Berlin a free city. Resolving these two tasks will clear the way for truly good and mutually beneficial relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany." Gromyko pointed out, however, that the West German side often departs from a sensible basis.

The Minister pointed out that in 1960, the close fraternal ties between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries expanded and strengthened. "The socialist countries form a united front on the most important international issues, especially on the most pressing issue of our time—the issue of war and peace."

Gromyko announced that the various countries participating in the socialist camp—the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries—are advancing side by side, forming a social, economic, and political family of free peoples united by close international socialist unity and common interests and consistent goals in building socialism and communism. This is reflected powerfully and vividly in the statement of the Representatives Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties, which made a profound Marxist-Leninist assessment of the current world situation and the development prospects of the world socialist system, the international workers' movement, and the struggle of the people of all countries for peace.

Gromyko said that our relations with the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia can be said to be good. He also said that the Soviet government hopes that cooperation between the two countries will continue to develop smoothly in the future on the issue of fighting for peace and easing international tensions.

Gromyko emphasized that strengthening and developing friendly cooperation with a large number of countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America that do not participate in aggressive military blocs and have chosen the path of neutrality occupies an important place in Soviet foreign policy.

Referring to Soviet-Japanese relations, Gromyko said, "Any Japanese government, as long as it expresses its willingness to pursue an independent policy and sincerely improve relations with the Soviet Union, can always get the understanding of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union will also express a corresponding willingness."

Gromyko pointed out that Soviet-Finnish relations, as in the past, have the spirit of sincerity and genuine good neighborliness. He believes that relations with the Scandinavian countries are satisfactory. He also said that the Soviet Union hopes to establish sincere and friendly relations with all Scandinavian countries.

Minister Gromyko said that the Soviet government fully sympathizes with and supports the willingness of the new Turkish leaders to improve relations with the Soviet Union and restore Soviet-Turkish friendship.

Gromyko said that the Soviet government hopes that the leaders of Iran will understand that the Soviet Union sincerely expects to establish good neighborly relations with Iran.

Gromyko pointed out that there is a prospect of some progress beginning to emerge in the Soviet Union's relations with Latin American countries. He believes that the recent visit of Brazilian Vice President Goulart to the Soviet Union and the exchange of parliamentary delegations between the Soviet Union and Bolivia are good beginnings in this regard.

Minister Gromyko said that the Soviet government regrets that Soviet-American relations have recently been tense and have deteriorated significantly. The Minister emphasized that "the responsibility for the failure lies entirely with the Eisenhower-Nixon administration."

He went on to say that the Soviet government hopes that with Kennedy's inauguration, Soviet-American relations can return to the track of the Roosevelt era.

The Foreign Minister announced that, as far as the Soviet government is concerned, it is fully prepared to promote the improvement of Soviet-American relations.

Gromyko emphasized that now the Soviet Union's international position and international prestige are more consolidated than ever before. This is a direct result of the unprecedented achievements of the Soviet people in virtually every aspect of our lives.

The Soviet Foreign Minister concluded by saying: "The Soviet government will continue to spare no effort, consistently and unswervingly, to defend the cause of peace so cherished by our people, who are engaged in building the brilliant edifice of communist society."

    关于国际形势和苏联外交政策
    葛罗米柯在最高苏维埃第六次会议上的报告（摘要）
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科23日讯：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯23日在苏联最高苏维埃第六次会议上作了关于国际形势和苏联外交政策的报告。
    葛罗米柯说，由于帝国主义列强的罪过而在刚果、阿尔及利亚和老挝发生的事件，“是这些国家人民的悲剧，但是同时，这也是他们完全摆脱外国统治、走向真正的民族复兴的战斗的序幕。”
    葛罗米柯宣称，决定人类社会历史发展的主要方向和主要特点的是世界社会主义体系，是进行反帝斗争的力量。在二十世纪暴风雨般的五十年代，未曾导致第三次世界大战的原因在于，苏联和整个社会主义阵营、以及各国人民民族解放运动和帝国主义国家内部的和平力量在不断粉碎着和平的敌人的阴谋。
    第二个原因是，社会主义阵营一年比一年发展的经济力量和军事力量及时地挡住了侵略者的道路。
    葛罗米柯强调指出：“这就意味着在国际关系的实践中和平力量超过战争力量！”
    葛罗米柯部长断言，国际政治中帝国主义国家所代表的那一派，一年一年地削弱，退出着一个又一个的阵地。西方的军事集团——北大西洋公约组织、东南亚条约组织和中央条约组织都在日益衰落，摇摇欲坠，其组织者的政策接二连三地遭到失败。
    西方政治家叫嚷“实力地位”政策越凶，他们的威胁听起来也越来越可怜和荒谬。
    葛罗米柯宣称：“可以制止侵略者重新发动世界战争的企图的时候来到了，而且，正在形成可以永远把战争排除于人类社会生活以外的条件。苏联、苏联人民的和平政策，正是为了要达到这个目的。”
    葛罗米柯把赫鲁晓夫同志在联合国大会第十五届会议上的发言称为“是以说服和影响各国人民的极其巨大的力量保卫和平事业的出色范例，是在现代运用列宁的外交风格的范例。”
    苏联政府首脑从联合国的讲台上传出的所有发言都包含了使所有国家的人民深深激动的建议。
    谈到苏联政府在联合国大会第十五届会议上坚决提出关于恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利的问题时，葛罗米柯宣称，本届会议表明，中国在联合国占有自己应有的席位的时候不远了，这将是在各国关系正常化方面和巩固世界和平的事业中前进一大步。
    苏联外交部长把在联合国大会会议上所发生的一切称为“是两个阵营、两个世界在维护各自的政治和道义立场方面进行的决斗”。
    其中有一个阵营号召在联合国的旗帜上写下这样的字：用和平和各国的彻底裁军来代替狂热的战争准备，用自由代替殖民主义锁链，用学校和医院来代替原子弹和氢弹。另一个阵营实际上企图用对军备的监督来偷换裁军，这就意味着事实上进一步鞭策各国在生产最可怕的武器、核弹、火箭等方面进行竞赛。
    谈到在西方时而有人提出苏联政府的建议受到欢迎以及赫鲁晓夫讲话具有吸引力的秘密是什么的问题时，葛罗米柯部长说：“对这个问题的回答是很简单的，这就在于真理，在于作为我们政策基础的崇高思想。秘密在于，我国不是玩弄裁军和和平，而是执行真诚的政策，而这一点是很难蒙蔽各国人民的。”
    在指出很多世纪以来资本主义建立起来的殖民主义奴役体系崩溃过程是不可避免的以后，葛罗米柯强调指出，最近一个时期，非洲各国人民的民族解放运动的成绩是特别显著的。
    苏联政府忠于列宁主义的尊重各国人民的民族权利的政策，无条件地承认新的自主国家的主权，并愿意根据完全平等的原则同它们发展关系。
    葛罗米柯强调指出，现在，苏联和其他社会主义国家不仅在道义上和政治上能够支持力求过独立生活的各国人民，而且能够在物质上和技术上给予他们以重大的援助。他还指出，这种援助基于友好和平等的协定，而不附带任何政治、军事或同遵守国家主权的原则不相容的其他条件。
    苏联部长再次声明，苏联既没有在非洲，也没有在世界其他地区为自己寻找任何优惠条件或特权。
    外交部长宣布，苏联政府完全支持加纳总统恩克鲁玛在联合国大会第十五届会议上提出的建议——把非洲变为没有火箭—核武器、不进行这种武器的试验以及没有外国军事基地的地区。
    谈到“殖民主义制度的卫士集团今天在那里横行霸道”的刚果局面时，葛罗米柯说，驱散议会、绑架卢蒙巴总理和他的战友并侮辱他们，这不是殖民主义者的胜利。葛罗米柯补充说，这些行动意味着，采取这些行动的那些人的脚底下的土地燃烧起来了。他们给非洲和全世界人民所上的课，不会白上。
    在刚果，最后发言权不属于外国掠夺者，而属于这个国家的人民，只有他们才有权成为国家主人。
    葛罗米柯说，哈马舍尔德及其在刚果的代表的行动，是殖民主义者帮凶的行动。现在，应该说每个人都清楚，多么迫切需要整顿联合国机构，它应该正确地反映世界上所形成的、现实的力量对比。葛罗米柯强调说，也只有这样，联合国才会有作为一个世界工具的前途。
    葛罗米柯把法国在其北大西洋公约组织的盟国的支持下对阿尔及利亚人民进行的战争叫做在我们的日子里，战争是殖民主义政策最可耻的现象之一。在陈述苏联在阿尔及利亚问题上的立场时，他强调指出，阿尔及利亚人民应该有可能自己决定自己的命运。
    谈到美国领导下的东南亚条约组织集团对老挝人民进行的武装干涉，葛罗米柯说，苏联坚决主张使老挝按照它的人民的意志始终成为一个独立的中立国家。
    葛罗米柯举出古巴作为在我们的时代里即使小国也有可能反抗帝国主义者并保卫自己的独立的范例。他强调说，古巴的事业现在成了拉丁美洲各国爱国力量的旗帜。他们发誓不让这个走在拉丁美洲各国人民民族解放斗争最前列的国家受到摧残。
    在指出联合国大会通过的关于给殖民地国家和人民以独立的宣言是有着巨大政治意义的文件以后，葛罗米柯说，现在的任务是：各国和各国人民应共同努力，力争尽快履行联合国的这一决议。
    谈到裁军问题，葛罗米柯说：“为了最大限度地使各方立场接近并尽快达成协议，苏联政府在自己的全面彻底裁军的建议中仔细考虑了西方国家在讨论我们全面彻底裁军建议时所提出的建议。”
    谈到这里他强调指出，苏联政府特别仔细地研究了那些有关对裁军的有效监督的问题。赫鲁晓夫说过，苏联准备接受任何监督，如果西方国家接受全面彻底裁军建议的话。他强调指出，可是西方国家反对有效的监督。“实际上，它们不仅是裁军的反对者，同时也是对裁军监督的反对者。”
    外交部长强调指出，苏联和中立国家在裁军问题上是一致的。葛罗米柯说，“我们同它们形成了一个共同阵线，裁军拥护者的阵线”。
    他说，西方国家反对在裁军委员会中增添五个中立国家，显然害怕这些国家会亲眼看见和亲身体会到，是谁在讨论裁军问题时起阻碍作用。
    葛罗米柯强调指出，苏联政府过去和现在都认为，举行有国家或政府首脑参加的联合国大会特别会议，将有利于讨论裁军问题。葛罗米柯接着说，北大西洋公约组织国家以继续加紧军备竞赛的路线来对抗苏联寻求全面彻底裁军途径的努力。他特别引证了刚刚结束的北大西洋集团理事会巴黎会议。葛罗米柯在谈到诺斯塔德的计划时强调指出，把北大西洋公约组织变成为“核强国”实际上意味着把西德变为“核强国”。
    外交部长将北大西洋公约组织各国领导人把事情说成这样：似乎十五个手指头来按电钮就意味着减少爆发火箭—核战争的危险性称为是荒谬绝伦的。葛罗米柯强调指出，可以有把握地说，爆发战争（其中包括偶然爆发）的危险性至少会增加到十五倍。
    葛罗米柯评述参加北大西洋公约组织理事会会议的十五个国家的部长们的公报是“这个远不光彩的组织从戈培尔的公署中学到的司空见惯的一堆反苏反共宣传的陈腔滥调。”部长宣布并补充说：“北大西洋公约组织的政策违背各国人民的意志。它向这些国家答应的不是和平，而是扩大战争准备。”
    葛罗米柯宣布：“鉴于北大西洋公约组织继续执行着侵略性的方针，并策划扩大战争准备，苏联当然要从这个事实中作出应有的结论。可以相信，我国的国防将完全符合于当前国际局势向它提出的要求。苏联和社会主义阵营所有其他国家的边界，将永远加上牢固可靠的锁。一旦必要时，苏维埃国家将为保卫我们的祖国、我们的朋友和盟国投入全部力量。”
    葛罗米柯强调指出，麦克米伦政府同意在苏格兰为携带有核弹头火箭的美国原子潜水艇修建基地的这种做法，是不合乎英国人的小心谨慎这种民族特点的。他补充说：“那些说英国领土上的外国基地的多少对于英国来说好像已经没有意义了的人，显然不相信有可能保卫和平，而抱着战争不可避免的看法。”
    葛罗米柯部长指出，苏联政府在缔结对德和约问题上表现出极大的耐性。他说：“在欧洲的问题中，这是我们同西方国家共同面临的主要问题。这是我们同西德的关系中的主要问题。”缔结和约将能打开苏联—西德关系中的新的一页。他接着说，“苏联政府主张尽快地同两个德国缔结和约，主张使西柏林成为自由城市。解决了这两项任务，就会为苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间的真正良好的和互利的关系扫清道路。”葛罗米柯指出，但是西德方面往往离开明智的基础。
    部长指出，1960年苏联同其他社会主义国家紧密的兄弟般的联系扩大了和加强了。”社会主义国家在最重要的国际问题上，首先是在当代最迫切的问题——战争与和平的问题上，结成一条统一的阵线。”
    葛罗米柯宣布，参加社会主义阵营的各个国家——苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家并肩前进，组成了由紧密的国际社会主义团结和建设社会主义和共产主义的共同利益和一致目标所团结起来的自由人民的社会、经济和政治的大家庭。这在各国共产党和工人党代表会议声明中得到十分有力和鲜明的反映，声明对于当前世界局势、以及对世界社会主义体系、国际工人运动和各国人民争取和平的斗争的发展前途，作了深刻的马克思列宁主义的估价。
    葛罗米柯说，我们同南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国的关系可以说是好的。他还说，苏联政府希望，在为和平、在为缓和国际紧张局势而斗争的问题上，两国之间的合作今后也将顺利地发展。
    葛罗米柯强调指出，加强和发展同不参加侵略性军事集团、并选择了中立道路的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲大批国家的友好合作，在苏联对外政策中占着重大地位。
    葛罗米柯谈到苏日关系时说，“任何一届日本政府，只要它表示愿意执行独立的政策，愿意真诚地改善同苏联的关系，它总可以得到苏联的谅解，苏联也将表示相应的愿望。”
    葛罗米柯指出，苏芬关系和过去一样具有真诚和真正睦邻关系的精神。他认为同斯堪的纳维亚国家的关系是令人满意的。他还说，苏联希望同所有斯堪的纳维亚国家建立真诚的友好关系。
    葛罗米柯部长说，土耳其新领导人打算改善同苏联的关系，恢复苏—土友谊，这种意愿受到苏联政府的完全同情和支持。
    葛罗米柯说，苏联政府希望伊朗的领导人能了解到，苏联真诚地期望同伊朗建立睦邻关系。
    葛罗米柯指出，苏联同拉丁美洲国家关系中开始呈现出有一定进展的前景。他认为，巴西副总统古拉特不久前在苏联的访问、苏联同玻利维亚互派议会代表团是这方面良好的开端。
    葛罗米柯部长说，苏联政府感到遗憾的是，苏美关系最近是紧张的，并且明显地恶化了。部长强调指出，“失败的责任全部在于艾森豪威尔—尼克松政府。”
    他接着说，苏联政府希望，随着肯尼迪的就任苏美关系能回到罗斯福时代的轨道上。
    外交部长宣布，如果谈到苏联政府，它完全准备促进苏美关系好转。
    葛罗米柯强调指出，现在苏联的国际地位和国际威信比任何时候都巩固。这是苏联人民在我国生活的可以说各个方面所取得的空前成就的直接结果。
    苏联外交部长最后说：“苏联政府今后仍将不遗余力地、始终如一地捍卫从事建设共产主义社会光辉大厦的我国人民所如此珍视的和平事业。”
