Combining Fire Prevention Education with Central Tasks
Taokeng Commune Achieves Eight Years Without Fires

    (Our Dispatch) The Taokeng People's Commune in Chaling County, Hunan Province, consistently emphasizes fire prevention work. The leadership, addressing the various understandings of fire prevention among the masses at each stage, continuously carries out fire prevention publicity and inspects the implementation of fire prevention measures, thus earning the honorable title of "Fire-Free Commune."
    Taokeng Commune is a mountainous area, vast and covered with deep forests, which the masses call "Wanbao Mountain" (Mountain of Treasures). However, in the past, the people here had old habits such as "setting fire to mountains to drive away beasts" and "lighting firewood for illumination on night roads." Therefore, fires often occurred before liberation. After liberation, the Party and the People's Government, based on the characteristics of the mountainous area, and centering on various central tasks, fully mobilized the masses to carry out a nationwide safety and fire prevention campaign. The broad masses actively participated, everyone paid attention to fire prevention, thereby achieving the brilliant result of eight years without fires. Among the seven brigades in the entire commune, four brigades have not experienced a fire for ten years.
    In the early days of liberation, due to the masses' negligence, fires occurred frequently in Taokeng Commune. The entire commune experienced twenty-two fires of varying sizes between 1949 and 1951 alone, burning over 5,000 mu of mountain area and destroying over 100 rooms of civilian housing. In response to these serious situations, the local Party committee, based on the mountainous area production policy of "relying on the mountains for sustenance and nurturing the mountains," organized report groups to conduct in-depth publicity in villages and households, vigorously carrying out publicity and education on "protecting forests and preventing fires, everyone's responsibility." At the same time, they ensured that publicity was regularized, posting slogans, hanging fire prevention signs, regularly organizing cadres to study fire prevention knowledge, having every household sign fire prevention covenants, and mobilizing the broad masses to actively participate in the fire prevention campaign. For example, the twenty-six production teams of Xiale Brigade all have safety covenants. The sixteen work groups of Kengkous Brigade all have safety and fire prevention propagandists. Most brigades universally implemented a three-way responsibility system of team-to-team, group-to-group, and person-to-area. Therefore, these brigades have been safe and disaster-free for ten years. Jiangkou Brigade also seized typical cases and adopted methods such as "calculating loss accounts," "on-site visits," and "inserting red flags" to conduct in-depth fire prevention publicity among the broad masses. Through on-site visits and typical education, each team also widely organized large-scale appraisals and competitions. Over the past eight years, Taokeng Commune has selected eight safety red flag production teams, and 454 commune members with meritorious fire prevention contributions have been commended and rewarded. Because fire prevention publicity is widespread and in-depth, forest protection and fire prevention work has formed a mass-based conscious action. The commune's children alone have organized twenty-three "fire prevention and safety forecast groups." Chen Yinggeng, a 61-year-old man, used to have a very serious attitude of negligence, saying, "Everything is determined by fate, what's the use of human prevention?" Through publicity, his ideological awareness has been greatly improved, he has actively participated in the fire prevention campaign, and he has been rated as a model of forest protection and fire prevention by the county, district, and commune six times.
    On the basis of mobilizing the masses, unifying thinking, and ensuring that everyone pays attention to fire prevention, the commune appropriately strengthened safety and fire prevention organizations and strengthened specific leadership over the fire prevention campaign. Under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels, seven non-detached fire prevention joint defense commando platoons were organized around the brigade as the center, and thirty-two fire prevention and disaster relief commando teams were established around the production team and work group as the center, laying out a fire prevention network everywhere and strengthening prevention work, thereby effectively preventing the occurrence of fires.

    结合中心工作随时进行防火教育
    桃坑公社八年无火灾
    本报讯　湖南茶陵县桃坑人民公社，经常注意防火工作。领导上针对群众每个时期对防火的各种不同认识，随时开展防火宣传，检查防火措施执行情况，从而获得“无火灾公社”的光荣称号。
    桃坑公社是一个山区，地区辽阔，到处是深山密林，群众称为“万宝山”。但是，过去这里的人民有“放火烧山驱兽”、“夜路点柴照明”等旧习惯，因此，解放前时常发生火灾。解放后，党和人民政府根据山区特点，围绕各项中心工作，充分发动群众，开展了全民性的安全防火运动。广大群众积极行动，人人注意防火，从而获得八年无火灾的辉煌战果。在全公社的七个大队中，有四个大队十年没有发生过火灾。
    解放初期，由于群众麻痹轻灾，桃坑公社火灾层出不穷。全公社仅1949年至1951年的三年内，就先后发生大小火灾二十二起，烧山面积达五千余亩，烧毁民房一百余间。当地党委针对这些严重情况，并根据“靠山吃山，吃山养山”的山区生产方针，组织了报告团，分村分户深入进行宣传，向广大群众大力开展了“护林防火，人人有责”的宣传教育。同时，做到了宣传经常化，贴标语，挂防火牌子，定期组织干部学习防火常识，户户订立防火公约，发动广大人民群众积极投入了防火运动。如夏乐大队的二十六个生产小队，队队都有安全公约。坑口大队十六个作业组，组组设有安全防火宣传员。大部分大队普遍实行了队包队，组包组，人包片的三包片责任制。因此，这些大队十年安全无灾。江口大队还抓住典型事例，采取“算损失账”、“现场参观”、“大插红旗”的方法，向广大群众深入地开展了防火宣传。通过现场参观，典型教育，各队还广泛地组织了大评比、大竞赛。八年来，桃坑公社共评出了安全红旗生产队八个，并有四百五十四名防火有功的社员，受到了表扬和奖励。由于防火宣传广泛深入，护林防火工作已形成了群众性的自觉行动。仅公社的少年儿童就组织了二十三个“防火安全预报小组”。六十一岁的老人陈应庚，过去麻痹轻灾思想非常严重，说什么“万事凭天定，人防有啥用。”通过宣传，思想觉悟大大提高，积极投入了防火运动，并曾六次被评为县、区和公社护林防火模范。
    这个公社在发动群众，统一思想，人人注意防火的基础上，全公社适当地加强了安全防火机构，加强了对防火运动的具体领导。在各级党委统一领导下，以大队为中心组织了七个不脱产的防火联防尖兵连，以生产队和作业组为中心，成立了三十二个防火救灾突击队，处处布下了防火网，加强预防工作，从而有力地防止了火灾的发生。
