    High-Altitude Leak-Proof Fountain Pen
    Recently, the Shanghai Golden Star Fountain Pen Factory successfully trial-produced the "60" model high-grade fountain pen. It took more than nine months and over 280 experiments to achieve success. Because of its special structure, this fountain pen will not leak when affected by external air pressure or sudden changes in temperature. It can withstand a temperature difference of 50 degrees Celsius without leaking, which is about 10 degrees higher than the high-grade fountain pens produced in Shanghai in the past.
    After high-altitude tests, it did not leak even at an altitude of 3,000 meters.

    高空不漏水的金笔
    最近上海金星金笔厂试制成功“六○”型高级金笔。前后九个多月，经历了二百八十多次试验得到成功。这种金笔当它受到外界气压影响或者温度骤变的时候，因为结构特殊，在温度高低相差五十度的情况下也不会漏水，比上海过去生产的高级金笔还高出十度左右。
    经过高空试验，在三千米的高空也没有漏水。
