Xinhua News Agency - Huazhong Institute of Technology Reorganized Scientific Research and Labor Time. Teachers and students live a tense, pleasant, and lively life. Dalian Institute of Technology adopts a combination of full-time staff and the masses to improve cafeteria work and receives praise.

    Xinhua News Agency reported that the Huazhong Institute of Technology Party Committee further implemented the spirit of combining work and rest, comprehensively arranged the lives of teachers, students, and staff, and ensured the smooth completion of the teaching plan.

    At the beginning of this semester, the Party Committee of the Institute decided that a deputy secretary would be in charge of life, and a group was established under the direct leadership of the Party Committee to specifically study and solve the living problems of the masses. For more than two months, they first made new arrangements for scientific research, teaching reform, and production labor, based on the principle of "ensuring key points." At the same time, some organizational structures were adjusted according to the actual situation, reducing the phenomenon of cadres holding too many concurrent positions, strengthening the planning of work, giving cadres at all levels more time to go to the front line, and ensuring that teachers, students, and staff have good rest.

    In accordance with the spirit of "politics in the cafeteria, cadres in the kitchen," the Party Committee of the Institute required the leaders of the General Affairs Department and various business departments to personally run the cafeteria well, and also required the Party General Branches of each department to strengthen their leadership over the cafeteria. Each department has a Party General Branch Secretary, a Party member department head, or an office director in the cafeteria, working with the catering staff to improve meals. The school also used scattered open spaces in the courtyard to carry out non-staple food production such as pig raising. At present, the work of all canteens in the institute has been greatly improved.

    The Party Committee of the Institute has tightly grasped life, and has achieved results in ensuring the health of teachers, students, and staff, ensuring the completion of the teaching plan, and improving the quality of teaching. Now, teachers have more time to compile lectures, collect data, reform experiments, and collect feedback. At the same time, mass cultural and recreational life is also more active. Recently, teachers and students held revolutionary story seminars during their spare time to "think about the past in the name of revolution"; carried out singing activities; and the cultural and recreational activities on Saturday nights were even more colorful. The lives of all teachers, students, and staff in the school are tense, pleasant, and lively.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, while strengthening the leadership of teaching, the Party Committee of Dalian Institute of Technology cares about the lives of the masses everywhere, focusing on the canteen, so that the food in the institute is getting better and better, which is warmly welcomed by the majority of teachers, students, and staff.

    There are eight canteens in this institute, and more than 10,000 teachers, students, and staff eat in the canteens. Since the beginning of this semester, in order to further improve the canteen, the Party Committee of the Institute specially convened a Party committee meeting to study the food work. The Party Secretary Cui Jian and other leading cadres often go deep into the kitchen to help cook, discover problems in time, and solve problems. Cadres going to the kitchen to participate in labor has become a system. Since the summer vacation, four batches of cadres have been rotated to participate in one to two months of labor. The Deputy Secretary of the Party General Branch of the Department of Physics and Chemistry, Shipbuilding, etc. led a group of cadres to go deep into the kitchen to eat, live, work, and discuss with the cooks, bringing political and ideological work to the canteen, and conducting education on the situation and tasks in light of the cooks' thoughts and work situation, and publicizing the Party's principles and policies on running the canteen well. After Wang Suxian, Deputy Secretary of the Party General Branch of the Department of Physics and Chemistry, went deep into the kitchen, she set an example and did everything like the cooks. She helped the canteen improve the system, strengthened the political education of the cooks, greatly improved the cooks' awareness, and made great progress in the canteen work.

    In order to run the canteen well, Dalian Institute of Technology generally adopted the two-pronged approach of combining a full-time team with the masses in canteen management. The eight canteens in the institute were delegated to the departments, and a canteen management committee composed of the department, the food section, and students was established. According to the requirements of the Party Committee, each department has a Deputy Secretary of the Party General Branch who specializes in managing food, mobilizing the masses, and everyone runs the food. As a result, the enthusiasm of all teachers, students, and staff has been fully mobilized. Many classes have actively helped the canteen with cooking utensil reforms. A class in the Department of Physics and Chemistry put forward more than 100 rationalization proposals for the canteen.

    Due to politics entering the canteen and cadres going to the kitchen, the food at Dalian Institute of Technology has greatly changed, with a variety of dishes and good adjustment of staple and non-staple foods. The cooks of the Sixth Canteen worked hard and were universally praised by teachers and students. While improving the food, each canteen also focused on sanitation. The sanitation work of the Sixth Canteen was outstanding and was repeatedly rated as an advanced sanitation unit in the institute.

    关心师生生活　多方促进教学
    华中工学院重新安排科学研究和劳动时间师生生活紧张、愉快、活泼大连工学院采取专职队伍和群众相结合办法改进食堂工作受到赞扬
    新华社讯　华中工学院党委进一步贯彻劳逸结合的精神，全面安排师生员工的生活，保证了教学计划的顺利完成。
    本学期开学初，学院党委决定由一个副书记专管生活，并在党委直接领导下成立了小组，专门研究和解决群众的生活问题。两个多月他们首先对科学研究、教学改革、生产劳动等工作，本着“确保重点”的方针作了新的安排。同时根据实际情况调整了一些组织机构，减少干部兼职过多的现象，加强了工作的计划性，使各级干部有更多时间深入第一线，也保证了师生员工休息得好。
    根据“政治到食堂、干部下厨房”的精神，学院党委要求总务处、各业务部门的领导干部亲自动手办好食堂，还要求各系党总支加强对食堂的领导，各系都有一位党总支书记、党员系主任或办公室主任下食堂，和炊管人员一道办好伙食。学校还利用院内零星空地见缝插针，开展养猪等副食品生产。目前，全院各个食堂的工作都有了较大的改进。
    学院党委紧紧地抓好生活，已在保证师生员工的身体健康，保证教学计划的完成，提高教学质量方面都收到了效果。现在，教师们编写讲义、收集资料、改革实验、收集反应等等的时间都更加充裕。同时，群众文娱生活也更活跃。最近，师生们在课余举行了“以革命的名义想想过去”的革命故事座谈会；开展了歌咏活动；星期六晚上文娱活动内容更是丰富多彩。全校师生员工们的生活过得紧张、愉快、活泼。
    据新华社讯　大连工学院党委在加强教学领导的同时，处处关心群众生活，大抓食堂，使全院的伙食越办越好，受到广大师生员工的热烈欢迎。
    这个学院共有八所食堂，在食堂就餐的师生员工有一万多人。本学期开学以来，为了进一步办好食堂，学院党委专门召开了党委会，对伙食工作进行了研究，党委书记崔健和其它领导干部经常深入伙房帮厨，及时地发现问题，解决问题。干部下伙房参加劳动已经形成制度，从暑假以来已经有四批干部轮流下伙房参加了一个月至两个月的劳动。物化、造船等五个系的党总支副书记带领了一批干部，深入伙房与炊事员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，把政治思想工作做到食堂里，结合炊事员的思想和工作情况，进行形势与任务的教育，宣传党关于办好食堂的方针政策。物化系党总支副书记王素贤深入到伙房以后，以身作则和炊事员一样什么都干，帮助食堂健全了制度，加强了对炊事员的政治教育，大大提高了炊事员的觉悟，使食堂工作有了很大进步。
    为了把食堂办好，大连工学院在伙食管理上，普遍采取了专职队伍与群众相结合两条腿走路的办法，将全院八所食堂下放到系，由系、伙食科和学生组成伙食管理委员会，根据党委的要求，各系都有一名党总支副书记专门管理伙食，发动群众，大家来办伙食。这样做的结果，充分调动了全体师生员工的积极性。许多班级都主动地帮助食堂搞炊具改革。物化系的一个班就为食堂提出了一百多条合理化建议。
    由于政治进食堂，干部下伙房，大连工学院的伙食大大变了样，饭菜花样多，主副食调剂得好。第六食堂的炊事员苦心钻研，受到师生们的普遍赞扬。在搞好伙食的同时，各食堂还大抓卫生工作，第六食堂的卫生工作做得出色，屡次被评为全院的卫生先进单位。
