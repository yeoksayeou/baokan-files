Xinhua News Agency, December 29th: Although the development of China's industrial production in 1960 was severely affected by natural disasters, thanks to the heroic efforts of all workers, it still continued to leap forward on the whole. As far as heavy industrial production is concerned, major products such as steel, iron, coal, electricity, oil, machine tools, and tractors are expected to meet or exceed planned targets. Among them, steel production is expected to reach 18.45 million tons, slightly exceeding the national plan of 18.4 million tons for this year.

This year, China's steel production increased by more than 5 million tons compared to last year, and is more than 50% higher than the 10.5 million to 12 million tons required by the Second Five-Year Plan. This allows China's steel industry to gain time to focus more on increasing the variety of steel and steel products and further improve the quality of steel and steel products in the last two years of the Second Five-Year Plan.

The extraordinarily severe natural disasters suffered by China this year have had a great impact on all sectors of the national economy, and heavy industrial sectors have also suffered direct losses. Due to the torrential rains and floods in August in Liaoning, Shandong, and Hebei provinces, the production of steel, iron, coal, and electricity, as well as transportation, were disrupted to varying degrees, resulting in losses in steel, iron, and coal production. At the same time, due to the adjustment of labor to support agricultural production, some local small and medium-sized enterprises and construction enterprises also reduced their original plans.

Light industry, which is closely related to agriculture and whose main raw materials are derived from agriculture, has been more severely affected by the disasters. In particular, the continuous disasters this year following last year have reduced the supply of raw materials for light industry. Therefore, production plans for several major products such as cotton textiles, knitwear, cigarettes, vegetable oil, and sugar will not be fulfilled. However, the workers in these departments have tried every means to open up sources of raw materials, save raw materials and materials, and produce more products than expected. As for other daily-use industrial products and small commodities that do not use agricultural and sideline products as their main raw materials, they have continued to grow this year.

This year, China's industrial departments have carried out technical transformation work on small and medium-sized steel and coal enterprises. Now, many small iron smelting plants have added blast equipment and hot blast equipment, and the transportation inside and outside the plants has generally been replaced by automobiles, small railways, or other various rail transportation and cableway transportation, replacing the original backward methods. The production appearance of these enterprises has been greatly improved compared to the early days of 1958.

In order to implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor of the national economy, this year, all industrial departments, especially the machinery industry and the chemical industry, have also made relatively significant contributions to supporting agriculture in technical transformation. This year, the output of products such as tractors, harvesters, tractor-drawn farm implements, and irrigation and drainage machinery has increased significantly compared to last year. The output of hand-pushed rubber-wheeled carts, fertilizers, and pesticides has also increased compared to last year. Industrial departments in various regions have also designated some factories and enterprises to specialize in manufacturing, repairing, and assembling agricultural machinery and producing other agricultural means of production.

This year, a vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, and a production increase and economy practice movement centered on grain and steel were launched on the industrial front. In the movement, many industrial departments in China created and adopted some new technologies and new experiences, which improved the level of production and technology. At present, the broad masses of workers and staff on the industrial front are actively preparing for next year's production. Many enterprises are preparing raw materials, materials, and fuels, producing more spare parts and accessories, and carrying out maintenance and repairs on machinery and equipment.

    工人阶级在特大自然灾害的严重影响下顽强战斗
    我国工业生产今年继续跃进
    钢产量将达到1845万吨比去年增加500多万吨
    各工业部门对支援农业技术改造作出了比较显著的贡献
    轻工业因农业受灾原料减少，纺织等几种主要产品将不能完成计划
    新华社29日讯　1960年，我国工业生产的发展虽因自然灾害受到严重影响，但是由于全体职工的英勇努力，整个看来仍然是继续跃进。就重工业生产来说，其中主要产品如钢、铁、煤、电、石油、机床、拖拉机等，预计可以完成计划或超额完成计划。其中钢的产量，预计将达到一千八百四十五万吨，比今年国家计划的一千八百四十万吨，略有超过。
    今年我国钢产量比去年增加五百多万吨，比第二个五年计划要求达到的一千零五十万吨到一千二百万吨还多50％以上。这就使我国钢铁工业赢得了时间，能够在第二个五年计划的最后两年，更多地致力于增加钢和钢材的品种，进一步提高钢和钢材产品的质量。
    今年我国遭受的特大自然灾害，对国民经济各部门的影响都很大，重工业部门也直接受到损失。辽宁、山东、河北等省由于在8月间遭到暴雨和洪水的袭击，钢、铁、煤炭、电力的生产和交通运输，都曾陷入不同程度的中断，使钢、铁、煤的产量受到损失。同时由于调整劳动力支援农业生产，一部分地方中小企业和建筑企业也缩小了原订计划。
    同农业关系极为密切、主要原料取之于农业的轻工业，受到灾害的影响比较严重。特别是今年继去年之后连续遭灾，轻工业原料减少，因此，棉纺织、针织、卷烟、植物油、糖等几种主要产品的生产计划，将不能完成。但是在这些部门的职工群众，曾千方百计地开辟原料来源，节约原料、材料，生产出了比预计较多的产品。至于其他不以农副产品为主要原料的日用工业品和小商品，今年都继续有所增长。
    今年，我国工业部门对钢铁和煤炭中小型企业进行了技术改造工作。现在许多小炼铁厂增加了鼓风设备和热风设备，厂内厂外的运输，一般已由汽车、小铁路或其他各种轨道运输、索道运输，代替了原来的落后的办法。这些企业的生产面貌，同1958年草创时期比较，已经大有改进。
    为了贯彻国民经济以农业为基础、工业为主导的方针，今年各工业部门，尤其是机械工业和化学工业对支援农业进行技术改造方面也作出了比较显著的贡献。今年拖拉机、收割机、机引农具和排灌机械等产品的产量，都比去年有较大的增加。手推胶轮车、化肥、农药的产量，也比去年有所增加。各地工业部门还划出一些工厂企业，来专门制造、修配农用机械和生产其他农业生产资料。
    今年，工业战线上开展了轰轰烈烈的以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新、技术革命运动，和以粮钢为中心的增产节约运动。在运动中，我国许多工业部门创造和采用了一些新技术和新经验，使生产水平和技术水平有所提高。目前，工业战线上的广大职工群众正在积极为明年的生产进行准备工作。许多企业都在准备原料、材料和燃料，生产更多的备品、配件，并对机器设备进行维护检修。（附图片）
