Xinhua News Agency, December 6th, Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Herter issued instructions on December 5th to the head of the U.S. "foreign aid" agency, the "International Cooperation Administration," Brenton L. Bradberry, prohibiting countries receiving U.S. "aid" from this agency from using "aid" funds to purchase goods in eighteen countries, including Britain, France, West Germany, and Japan, as well as Hong Kong.

This instruction blatantly demonstrates that the United States is sacrificing the interests of its allies and other countries to alleviate its urgent international payment crisis.

In his instructions, Herter announced that "the work of procuring goods with the funds of the International Cooperation Administration's programs" would be "stopped" in eighteen countries and regions including Britain, France, West Germany, Japan, Italy, Canada, Sweden, Norway ,Switzerland, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Morocco, Australia, the Federation of South Africa, and Hong Kong. In other words, the "recipient" countries are forced to use "US aid" to buy American goods, even though, as the USIS admitted in its report on this instruction, purchasing in the United States is more expensive than in other countries. According to United Press International, U.S. State Department officials believe that as a result of the implementation of Herter's instruction, Japan will lose $130 million in business annually. It is "the hardest hit country," followed by "West Germany, Britain, France and Italy."

It is reported that in the U.S. fiscal year 1960, the total value of goods purchased with "International Cooperation Administration" "aid" funds reached $867.3 million, of which $360.7 million was spent in the United States, and a total of $506.6 million was spent in other countries, of which the above-mentioned eighteen countries and Hong Kong accounted for approximately $400 million. This means that the United States is attempting to use this measure to obtain $400 million in trade revenue. Compared with the United States' huge international payment deficit, this amount is only a small fraction. However, the United States, which has been overwhelmed by the dollar crisis, is indiscriminately grabbing at anything it can to squeeze out a little money, regardless of whether they are "allies" or not.

Xinhua News Agency, December 6th, Washington: U.S. Treasury Secretary Anderson stated in a television address on the evening of the 4th that although he had recently been rebuffed everywhere in Western Europe, the United States would continue to try to shift the serious international payment crisis onto other capitalist countries.

Anderson emphasized that his and Dillon's recent talks with the Adenauer government to squeeze oil from West Germany "have not ended." He said that the talks were "merely an attempt to get the West German government to share some of the costs of maintaining U.S. troops stationed in West Germany," and that the United States "is now exploring very carefully" the possibility of West Germany purchasing more military supplies from the United States to increase U.S. revenue. Anderson also said that the United States will continue to demand that West Germany and other Western countries share the costs of "aid" to underdeveloped countries and make them "remove restrictions on American goods." He emphasized that, in the view of the United States, it is "appropriate" for the United States to continue discussing with West Germany whether it is possible to find "certain methods" to compensate for the transfer of dollars from the United States to West Germany.

Anderson admitted that the U.S. international payment problem is serious. He said that the U.S. international balance of payments deficit this year will approach $4 billion.

In response to West German accusations against the United States, Anderson denied that the U.S. forcing West Germany to pay for maintaining U.S. troops was a "sudden" move. Anderson made it clear that the reason why the United States is unwilling to let West Germany go is because it believes that West Germany has the most oil to squeeze. He said that West Germany's annual accumulated surplus is now equal to about half of the United States' annual payment deficit.

    美国竭力设法转嫁美元危机
    赫脱下令规定在十八个国家内美“援”款项只能用来买美国货
    据新华社6日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿赫脱5日向美国的“援外”机构“国际合作署”署长李德尔伯格发出指示，禁止从这个机构接受美“援”的国家用“援助”款项在英、法、西德、日本等十八个国家和香港采购货物。
    这一指示赤裸裸地表明美国要牺牲它的盟国和其他一些国家的利益来缓和它的国际支付危机的燃眉之急。
    赫脱在指示中宣布，在英国、法国、西德、日本、意大利、加拿大、瑞典、挪威、瑞士、丹麦、比利时、荷兰、奥地利、卢森堡、新西兰、摩洛哥、澳大利亚、南非联邦十八个国家和香港，“停止以国际合作署的计划的经费采购商品的工作”。换句话说，就是硬要受“援”国用“美援”买美国货，尽管像美新处在报道这一指示时所承认的，在美国采购比在其他国家要贵。据合众国际社报道，美国国务院的官员认为，赫脱这项指示实施的结果，日本每年将损失一亿三千万美元的买卖。它是“受打击最大的一个国家”，其次是“西德、英国、法国和意大利”。
    有消息说，在美国1960财政年度内，用“国际合作署”“援助”款项采购的商品总值达八亿六千七百三十万美元，其中花在美国的为三亿六千零七十万美元，花在其他国家的共计五亿零六百六十万美元，其中上述十八个国家和香港约占四亿美元。这就是说，美国企图用这一措施捞到四亿美元的贸易收入。这笔钱同美国的巨额国际支付赤字比起来，只是一个小数目。但是被美元危机弄得焦头烂额的美国，是饥不择食，不管“盟国”不“盟国”，能挤到一点钱便挤一点。
    据新华社6日讯　华盛顿消息：美国财政部长安德逊4日晚上发表电视谈话，表示尽管他最近在西欧到处碰壁，美国还是要继续设法把严重的国际支付危机转嫁到其他资本主义国家头上。
    安德逊强调，他和狄龙最近同阿登纳政府举行的要从西德挤出油水的会谈“并没有结束”。他说，那次会谈“仅仅是设法使西德政府分担一些维持美国在西德的驻军的费用”，美国“现在正在十分仔细地探索”西德向美国购买更多的军需品以增加美国的收入的可能性。安德逊还说，美国将继续要求西德和其他西方国家分担对不发达国家的“援助”费用和使它们“取消对美国货的限制”。他强调说，在美国看来，美国同西德继续讨论是否可能找到“某些方法”来补偿美元从美国转移到西德是“适当”的。
    安德逊承认美国国际支付问题严重。他说，美国今年国际收支逆差将接近四十亿美元。
    安德逊针对西德方面对美国的指责，否认美国逼迫西德出钱维持美国驻军的做法是“突如其来”的。安德逊表明，美国所以对西德不肯干休，是因为它认为西德的油水最大。他说，西德每年积累的盈余现在等于美国每年的支付逆差的一半左右。
