    Preventing fires is a matter of great economic and political significance. The occurrence of fires can cause extremely great losses to the motherland's socialist construction and the people's lives and property. Therefore, factories, mines, transportation, capital construction, and people's communes in various regions, as well as the broad masses of people, should pay special attention to fire prevention work.
    The decisive factor in preventing fires lies in people. As long as leaders at all levels can attach importance to fire prevention work, take effective measures in a timely and proactive manner against the causes that may lead to fires, educate and mobilize the broad masses, and mobilize and organize the enthusiasm of the broad masses to proactively carry out fire prevention work, fires can be completely prevented in any season and in any area. This has been repeatedly proven by the facts in many regions. For example, Yuankang Lane, a shantytown in Wuxi City, used to be a "fire dragon's lair," but under the leadership of retired old worker Wang San, all the residents continuously carried out fire prevention propaganda and fire prevention inspections, and eliminated fire hazards in a timely manner. No fire occurred for three years. Daowai District in Harbin City has dense housing and many old buildings. In the past, fires were often caused by sparks from cracked chimneys and stoves. The leaders and the broad masses of workers and staff in this district spent half a month conducting a comprehensive inspection of the chimneys and stoves in the district, adopted some practical and effective measures, eliminated fire hazards, and have not had a fire for a long time.
    Currently, looking at the country as a whole, the development of this work is uneven. Some have done well, while others have not done well or not so well. Even those places that have achieved long-term fire-free status cannot be negligent in the slightest. It should be understood that after conducting a major inspection and resolving old fire hazards, new fire hazards will arise after a period of time; when loopholes in one area are blocked, loopholes in another area may appear. Therefore, the struggle against fire must be persistent, and we must always prevent possible complacency and satisfaction with the status quo. We must be good at being prepared for danger in times of peace, paying attention to unsafe aspects in safe situations, and seeing new dangerous factors that may cause fires. Different places and different units must fully carry out educational work based on the characteristics of fire hazards, focus on prevention several times a year, actively prevent and guard against them, and nip them in the bud.
    The occurrence of fires, although related to seasonal changes to a certain extent, is also due to more complex reasons in some cases. It should be noted that with the great development of national production and construction, the growth and concentration of material wealth, the increase in sources of fire and heat, especially the increase in the production, use, storage, and transportation of chemical flammable and explosive materials, the task of fire prevention is becoming increasingly heavy. At present, the people of the whole country are vigorously carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and with the arrival of winter, the use of fire for heating and insulation has increased, making fire prevention work even more important. The people of the whole country should immediately take action, under the leadership of the Party and the government, and focusing on the campaign to increase production and practice economy, vigorously strengthen the fire safety work of factories, mines, and rural people's communes. Conscientiously do a good job in the fire safety work of grain and cotton warehouses, construction site sheds, chemical production, forests, grasslands, and areas prone to fires in winter.
    All people's communes, factories, mines, transportation departments, construction site sheds, and general residents should conduct a fire safety inspection and strengthen fire safety education. It is necessary to do a good job in the fire prevention work of threshing grounds, grain and cotton warehouses, processing plants, and livestock sheds, and earnestly do a good job in patrolling and guarding grain and cotton warehouses, so as not to allow any threshing ground, grain and cotton warehouse, or processing plant to be attacked by fire. In order to protect production and ensure the completion and overfulfillment of this year's national plan, all factories, mines, and transportation departments must do a good job in fire safety work. All units should, on the basis of fire safety inspections, quickly establish and improve fire safety systems and fire prevention organizations, and implement a fire prevention responsibility system with responsibility assigned at each level. All employees, especially those engaged in the production, transportation, storage, and use of chemical flammable materials, must conscientiously study and master fire safety operation knowledge, operate in accordance with production operation procedures, and consciously abide by fire safety systems. All construction sites must conscientiously implement the State Council's regulations on fire prevention for construction site sheds. The construction of sheds must meet fire safety requirements. Flammable materials on construction sites should be concentrated and cleaned frequently, various sources of fire should be strictly controlled, good fire prevention habits should be cultivated, and the occurrence of fires in construction site sheds should be prevented. Urban and rural residents and employees of government agencies and schools should conduct a general safety inspection of heating and cooking fire equipment, and chimneys and stoves that do not meet fire safety requirements should be improved. Schools and parents should often educate their students and children not to play with fire, so as to prevent children from causing fires.
    The various full-time and volunteer fire brigades are the backbone force in the fight against fire, and bear the sacred responsibility of protecting the socialist construction of the motherland and the safety of the people's lives and property. On the one hand, they must actively participate in and lead the masses in vigorously carrying out fire prevention propaganda and fire prevention inspections. On the other hand, they must step up training, improve their fighting spirit and firefighting skills, stick to their posts, and be on guard at all times. Once a fire alarm occurs, they must concentrate firefighting forces and quickly extinguish the fire, so as not to spread it into a disaster and avoid causing great losses.
    As everyone knows, all sources of fire, power sources, and flammable materials are directly controlled and used by the masses. As long as we resolutely rely on the masses and mobilize the masses to consciously fight against fire, the factors that cause fire and fire hazards can be eliminated. Of course, in the struggle against fire, we must also maintain a high degree of political vigilance against the enemy's arson and sabotage. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, all localities must fully mobilize the masses, follow the mass line, and achieve fire prevention by everyone and everywhere, so that fire can certainly be prevented.

    防患于未燃
    防止火灾是一项具有重大的经济和政治意义的事情。火灾的发生，会对祖国社会主义建设事业和人民群众生命财产造成极大的损失，因此，厂矿企业、交通运输、基本建设和各地人民公社以及广大人民群众对防止火灾的工作应当特别重视。
    防止火灾的决定因素在于人。只要各级领导能够重视防火工作，针对可能发生火灾的原因，适时地、主动地采取有效措施，教育和发动广大群众，把广大群众的积极性调动、组织起来，主动进行防火工作，不论在任何季节和部位，火灾都是完全可以防止的。这是许多地区的事实所一再证明了的。例如：无锡市的一处棚户区源康弄，过去是“火龙地”，但是在退休老工人王三的带动下，全体居民不断进行防火宣传和防火检查，及时消除火患漏洞，三年没有发生过一起火灾。哈尔滨市道外区，房屋密集，旧建筑物多，过去常常由于烟囱、炉灶裂缝滋火引起火灾，这个区的领导和广大职工群众，用了半个月的时间，对全区的烟囱、炉灶进行了全面检查，采用了一些切实有效的措施，消除了火险因素，长期未发生火灾。
    目前，就全国来看，这项工作的发展是不平衡的，有做得好的，也有做得不好或不大好的，就是那些已经做到长期无火灾的地方，也不能有一点儿疏忽大意。要知道，进行一次大检查，旧的火灾隐患解决了，过了一个时期，新的火灾隐患又会产生；这一方面的漏洞堵塞了，另一方面的漏洞又可能出现。因此，同火灾作斗争要坚持不懈，时时刻刻防止可能产生的麻痹大意和满足现状的情绪。要善于居安思危，在安全的情况下，注意到不安全的方面，看到产生火灾的新的危险因素。不同地方、不同单位要根据火灾隐患的特点，充分作好教育工作，每年大抓几次，积极防范，防患于未燃。
    火灾的发生，虽然与季节的变化有着一定的关系，但是，有些火灾的发生原因是比较复杂的。应该看到，随着国家生产建设的大发展，物资财富的增长和集中，火源、热源的增加，特别是化学易燃易爆物品的生产、使用、贮存和运输量的增多，防火的任务日趋繁重。当前全国人民正在轰轰烈烈地开展增产节约运动，加之冬季来临，取暖保温用火增多，做好防火工作就更加重要。全国人民应该立即行动起来，在党和政府的领导下，围绕增产节约运动，大力加强厂矿企业、城乡人民公社的防火安全工作。认真地做好粮棉仓库、工地工棚、化工生产、森林、草原，以及冬季容易发生火灾部位的防火安全工作。
    各人民公社、厂矿企业、交通运输部门、工地工棚以及一般居民，都要作一次防火安全的检查，加强防火安全教育。要做好打谷场、粮棉仓库、加工厂、牲畜棚的防火工作，切实做好粮、棉仓库的巡逻守护，不使任何一个打谷场，一个粮棉仓库、加工厂受到火灾的侵袭。各厂矿企业和交通运输部门，为了保卫生产，保证完成和超额完成今年国家计划，必须做好防火安全工作。各单位应当在防火安全检查的基础上，迅速地将防火安全制度和防火组织建立与健全起来，实行层层包干负责的防火责任制度。所有的职工，特别是从事生产、运输、保管和使用化学易燃物品的职工，要认真地学习和掌握防火安全操作知识，按照生产操作规程办事，自觉地遵守防火安全制度。各个建筑工地要认真贯彻执行国务院有关工地工棚防火的规定，工棚的建筑要符合防火安全的要求，工地的易燃材料集中，要经常清理，严格控制各种火源，养成良好的防火习惯，杜绝工地工棚火灾的发生。城乡居民和机关学校的职工，对取暖和炊事用火设备要普遍进行安全检查，不符合防火安全要求的烟囱炉灶，要加以改善。学校和儿童家长要经常教育自己的学生和孩子不要玩火，以免儿童玩火成灾。
    各个专职和义务消防队是同火灾作斗争的骨干力量，担负着保护祖国社会主义建设和人民生命财产安全的神圣责任。一面要积极参加和带动群众大搞防火宣传和防火检查，一面要加紧训练，提高斗志和灭火本领，坚守岗位，时刻戒备，一旦发生火警，就集中消防力量，迅速扑灭，不使蔓延成灾，避免造成大的损失。
    大家知道，所有的火源、电源和易燃物品都是由群众直接控制和使用的，只要我们坚决依靠群众，发动群众自觉地同火灾进行斗争，起火的因素和火险隐患，是可以消除的。当然，在同火灾斗争的时候，对于敌人的纵火破坏，也必须保持高度的政治警惕。各地要在党和政府的领导下，充分发动群众，走群众路线，做到人人防火，处处防火，这样，就一定可以防止火灾。
