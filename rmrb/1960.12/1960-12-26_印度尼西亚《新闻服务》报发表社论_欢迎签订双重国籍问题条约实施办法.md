Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 25th: The Indonesian newspaper "News Service" published an editorial yesterday, warmly welcoming the signing of the implementation measures for the Treaty on the Issue of Dual Nationality between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia.

The editorial said that the signing of these implementation measures reflects the good wishes of both sides. This good wish shows that the friendship between these two neighboring countries should not be undermined by certain groups who are afraid of the development of friendship between the two countries.

The editorial also said that the signing of these implementation measures reminds people of the close feelings and friendship between the two countries. People also remember that when Indonesia was fighting to put down the counter-revolutionary rebellion and recover West Irian occupied by Dutch imperialism, China provided support to Indonesia.

The editorial pointed out that those groups who are unhappy about the continued development of friendship between Indonesia and China will do everything possible to undermine the atmosphere of cooperation that has been established. The editorial expressed the hope that both Indonesia and China, in the spirit of resolving the issue of dual nationality in a simple way, will do their utmost to smoothly implement these implementation measures.

The newspaper also published the full text of the implementation measures for the Treaty on the Issue of Dual Nationality.
