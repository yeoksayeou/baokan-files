Xinhua News Agency, Changsha Electric Dispatch: The water levels of various rivers in Hunan Province have reached the dry season. Workers in the province's wooden sailboat transport departments are launching a mass movement to overcome low water levels by adapting to local conditions and carrying out technological innovations to improve transportation efficiency. The volume of transportation completed by wooden sailboats throughout the province in October increased by 5.4% compared to September, and the first twenty days of November maintained the same level as the same period last month.

In addition to the four major rivers of Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li, Hunan Province also has more than 370 tributaries scattered throughout the province, as well as many small ports accessible to wooden sailboats. However, due to less rainfall from September to March of the following year, riverbed water levels drop, often affecting water transport. This year in particular, there has been little rainfall, and since July, the riverbed water levels of some small rivers and the upper reaches of the four major rivers have dropped significantly, seriously affecting wooden sailboat transport. Therefore, starting in July, the workers in the province's wooden sailboat transport departments put forward the slogan "Small drought does not reduce production, large drought does not stop navigation" and launched a mass movement to overcome low water levels.

Across the province, advanced transportation experiences are being promoted and boat types are being improved to increase buoyancy, increase load capacity, and accelerate speed, adapting to the current characteristics of shallow riverbed water levels. About 70% of the province's wooden sailboats have promoted experiences such as wooden boat towing (wooden boat towing wooden boat), two-boat assistance (connecting two wooden boats together), double-winged boats (adding two small boats to the sides of a main boat), and boat towing wooden rafts (using wooden or bamboo rafts to load bulky or large cargo). Another 15% of the province's old-fashioned wooden sailboats have been fitted with a fish-belly-shaped shell on the side of the boat, increasing the boat's buoyancy, increasing its load capacity, accelerating its speed, and ensuring safe navigation. More than 280 dangerous shoals in the province's major rivers are generally equipped with various types of beach winches powered by animal power, water power, and manpower to help ships pass the shoals smoothly.

Building dams to block water, dredging shoals and digging mud to raise water levels is an important measure for many small rivers to overcome low water levels. The Liuyang County Transportation Cooperative, starting in mid-August, adopted a method that combined dredging as the main focus, key reef blasting, regular mud digging, and building dikes to block water, dredging 323 kilometers of waterways, building eleven water-blocking dams, and raising the riverbed water level, enabling 90% of the waterways to be navigable, and increasing the boat's load capacity from two tons to more than three tons.

### 湖南木帆船运输部门大搞群众运动  战胜枯水保证冬季正常运输

    湖南木帆船运输部门大搞群众运动
    战胜枯水保证冬季正常运输
    据新华社长沙电　湖南省各大小河流已到枯水季节，全省木帆船运输部门职工正在因地制宜地开展技术革新，掀起一个战胜枯水的群众运动，提高运输效率。全省木帆船10月份完成的运输量，比9月份增长5.4％，11月份头二十天仍然保持上月同期的水平。
    湖南省除湘、资、沅、澧四水以外，还有遍布全省的三百七十多条支流以及许多可以通行木帆船的小港。但是由于每年9月到第二年3月，雨水较少，河床水位下降，常常影响水上运输。特别是今年雨水少，从7月份开始，就有部分小河和四大主要河流的上游，河床水位显著下降，严重影响了木帆船运输。因此，从7月份起，全省木帆船运输部门的职工就提出“小枯不减产，大枯不断航”的口号，开展战胜枯水的群众运动。
    全省各地适应当前河床水位浅的特点，推广先进运输经验，改良船型，以增加浮力，提高载量，加快航速。全省已有70％左右的木帆船，分别推广了木木拖带（木船拖木船）、两船相帮（用两个木船相连在一块）、双翼船（一个主船两侧加帮两只小船）、船拖木?（利用木?或竹?装载泡货或大件货物）等经验。全省还有15％的旧式木帆船在船边加装了一个鱼肚形的外壳，增加了船的浮力，提高了载量，加快了航速，保证了航行安全。全省主要河流的二百八十多个滩险，一般都安装了畜力、水力、人力等各种各样的上滩绞车，帮助船只顺利过滩。
    筑坝堵水，疏滩掏泥，提高水位，是许多小河道战胜枯水的一个重要措施。浏阳县运输合作社，从8月中旬开始，采取以疏为主、重点炸礁、经常掏泥、筑堤堵水相结合的办法，疏通了三百二十三公里航道，修建了十一座堵水坝，提高了河床水位，使90％的河道能通航，船的载量由二吨提高到三吨以上。（附图片）
