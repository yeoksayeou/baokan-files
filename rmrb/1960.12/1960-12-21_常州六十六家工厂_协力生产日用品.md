Changzhou, Jiangsu Province – The financial and trade departments of Changzhou City, Jiangsu Province, have adopted a method of cross-factory and cross-industry collaboration to vigorously increase the production of various daily necessities. This has rapidly "integrated" and filled gaps in many product categories. The variety of daily necessities produced in the city has increased to more than 9,200, and the self-sufficiency rate has increased by 12% compared to the third quarter.

In the vigorous increase in the production of daily necessities, the leading cadres of the city’s financial and trade departments, through product surveys and in-depth market research, discovered that producing complete sets of various daily necessities is an important aspect of ensuring market supply. Therefore, they put forward the requirements of "availability, quantity, completeness, and novelty" to the city's light industry and daily necessities factories, educating everyone to recognize the significance of producing complete sets of daily industrial products. Subsequently, they organized factories to understand market needs. According to the requirements of filling gaps and producing complete sets, they implemented large-scale production collaboration. For example, in terms of cooking utensils, the Daily Hardware Factory, Cookware Factory, Wood Products Factory, Bamboo Products Factory, and Electrical Porcelain Factory, among others, collaborated to vigorously increase the production of coal stoves, pots, kitchen knives, spatulas, fire tongs, pot lids, bamboo chopsticks, bamboo baskets, and other products. Based on investigation and research, sixty-six relevant factories in the city formed eight "dragons," including daily hardware, shoes and hats, knitwear, cosmetics, stationery, wooden furniture, lead wire nails, and bamboo utensils, to carry out competitions. The "dragon" collaboration competition greatly promoted the production of new varieties of daily industrial products and effectively expanded the scope of domestically produced daily commodities.
