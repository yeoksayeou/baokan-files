Good Mother of Women and Infants

By our reporter Cen Lidan

The狂wind was rolling with torrential rain, blowing harder and harder. Midwife Mo Yuxiang, having been busy all day, finally returned home. She was soaked to the skin by the rain, and her legs were so tired she could barely walk. Before she could eat or even change her clothes, a middle-aged man staggered in. He cried out in a trembling voice, "Sister, my wife has been in labor all day with ceaseless bleeding, come quickly!" Mo Yuxiang turned her head and saw that it was Shen Yulan's husband. From his panicked expression, she could already guess the situation of the mother-to-be. So, she hurriedly put on her raincoat, picked up her midwifery kit, and followed the man.

The night was pitch black, and the storm made it almost impossible to stand. The two of them supported each other, stumbling and falling as they made their way to Yanling Village. Just as they reached the riverbank, the kerosene lamp was blown out. Crossing the river in the dark was dangerous, but when she thought of the two lives waiting to be saved, Mo Yuxiang bravely jumped into the chest-deep river and crossed it with Shen Yulan's husband. When they arrived, the mother was in critical condition due to a breech birth. She quickly began emergency treatment, and after more than an hour, the child was born with a cry, and the mother was out of danger. Mo Yuxiang, without resting, busied herself boiling water and cooking for the mother until everything was taken care of. Only then did she happily drag her tired steps away.

In Yanling Brigade, Jiming Commune, Dingchang County, Hainan Island, the touching stories of midwife Mo Yuxiang's dedication to mothers and infants are widely circulated and unforgettable.

Mo Yuxiang was a poor peasant who was emancipated after liberation. In 1952, she learned modern midwifery. At first, she happily told the women from door to door: "The Communist Party is really good, caring even about our women's childbirth. Now we have modern midwifery, mothers don't have to fear the gates of hell!" The women were silent in front of her, but murmured behind her back: "She only studied in the county for ten days and is already bragging!"

On the third night after she returned to the village, the mother of Mo Qionghua, a woman from the same village, came to her gasping for breath. It turned out that Qionghua, due to superstition, was giving birth in the cowshed as usual. Because the child could not be born, the old midwife who had been invited was helpless. Mo Qionghua's mother became anxious and called Mo Yuxiang. When Mo Yuxiang rushed to the cowshed, taking three steps at a time, Mo Qionghua was already dying. The old midwife wanted her to squat on the ground, saying that squatting would make it easier for the child to come out. The neighboring women were in a flurry beside her, preparing to pray for gods to drive away ghosts. Regardless of the crowd's obstruction, Mo Yuxiang quickly helped the mother to bed and used the modern method she had learned to deliver the baby. Before long, the child was born, but the mother fainted due to excessive blood loss. "It's not good, we must have offended the 'Ghost Woman'. If you don't ask the 'Ghost Woman' when giving birth, you can't live!" The women around shouted, and the old midwife said even more aggressively, "You will be responsible if someone dies!" Under the many accusations, Mo Yuxiang was indeed anxious. However, when she remembered that when she gave birth to her second child, it was because she listened to the superstitious words of the "Ghost Woman" and put a tile basin of cold water on her head, then broke the tile basin with a knife, letting the cold water pour down from her head. As a result, she suffered from puerperal fever for more than a month after childbirth, and still suffered from headaches from time to time. Thinking of this, she no longer hesitated and calmly continued to use the modern methods she had learned to rescue the mother. The mother finally woke up, and when she saw the newborn baby, she couldn't help but shed tears and said to Mo Yuxiang, "If it weren't for you, my child and I would be dead!"

From then on, the benefits of modern midwifery spread like wildfire in the remote villages nearby. The mothers in nearby villages all regarded Mo Yuxiang as their own family. Mo Yuxiang, regardless of day or night, wind or rain, tirelessly traveled to various villages to give pregnant women prenatal examinations and deliver babies.

In 1958, the people's communes established maternity homes and nurseries in various brigades as welfare undertakings. Because this village was very superstitious, believing that building a maternity home in the village would suppress the "dragon head," which was unlucky, some landlord elements took the opportunity to incite upper-middle peasants to beat Mo Yuxiang, secretly destroying the houses of the maternity home, and spreading rumors everywhere, saying: "Children born in the maternity home cannot be raised, they will die as soon as they are born." Mo Yuxiang reported these situations to the Party branch and worked with the masses to stop the landlord elements' rumors and sabotage. At that time, children in the village were suffering from measles, so she decocted herbal medicine and delivered it to the sick children from house to house. When she saw seriously ill patients, she did not hesitate to run dozens of miles to the commune health center to invite a doctor. The masses were touched by her selfless spirit, and those who originally opposed running the maternity home were silent. However, new difficulties arose. To run a maternity home, there were no medicines, scissors, forceps, and other equipment. Asking the brigade for money was impossible, as the brigade had a weak foundation and could not afford it. What to do? Mo Yuxiang was not discouraged at all. She mobilized Liang Aimei, who had studied modern midwifery with her in the county, and the two of them went up the mountain to cut wood and dig up tree roots, and also reclaimed wasteland to grow sweet potatoes. She sold the firewood and sweet potatoes she collected to the supply and marketing cooperative, plus the help of the masses, raising more than seventy yuan to buy a batch of medicines, gauze, and utensils. She also mobilized carpenters to voluntarily make beds and benches, and repair windows and doors for the maternity home. In this way, the maternity home was established.

Since last year, all of the more than one hundred and eighty mothers in Yanling Brigade have given birth in this maternity home, and both mothers and children have been safely discharged. After the mothers were discharged, Mo Yuxiang often went to visit them. One woman died of other illnesses, leaving behind a two-month-old baby. Mo Yuxiang tried to mobilize five nursing mothers to take turns breastfeeding the baby, so that this baby who had lost her mother could grow up healthily. When the team members talked about these things, they affectionately called Yuxiang "the good mother of women and infants." In May of this year, Mo Yuxiang was selected as a national advanced health worker and went to Beijing to attend the National Congress of Outstanding Workers in Culture and Education. Now, she is the Party branch secretary of the brigade, leading the production and health work of the entire brigade.

    妇婴的好妈妈
　　本报记者　岑荔丹
    狂风卷着暴雨，一阵紧似一阵地刮打着。接生员莫玉香忙了一天，总算回到了家里。她全身被雨淋得透湿，双脚累得快走不动了。没有吃饭，也没有来得及换衣服，一个中年男人就踉踉跄跄闯进来，他颤声喊道：“大嫂，我家婆娘肚痛了一天，流血不止，快去看看！”莫玉香扭头一看，是沈玉兰的丈夫，从他惊惶的脸色，她已经猜出了产妇处境。于是，她赶忙披上蓑衣，拿起接生箱，跟着来人就走。
    夜，伸手不见五指，暴风雨吹打得人几乎站不住脚。他们两人搀扶着，一步一跌地往岩岭村走去。刚到河边，风雨灯被吹熄了，摸黑过河是危险的，但是，一想到两条生命正在等待着去抢救，莫玉香就奋不顾身地跳下齐胸的河水，和沈玉兰的丈夫一起涉过小河。他们赶到时，因为逆产，产妇生命垂危。她赶快动手急救，一个多小时后，孩子呱呱落地了，产妇也脱离了危险。莫玉香顾不得休息，又忙着给产妇烧开水，煮饭，直到一切都料理好，她才愉快地拖着疲乏的步子离开。
    在海南岛定昌县鸡鸣公社岩岭大队，接生员莫玉香这样一心一意为产妇、专心致志为婴儿的感人事迹，到处流传，令人难忘。
    莫玉香是解放后才翻身的贫农，1952年学习新法接生。当初，她满心欢喜地挨家挨户告诉妇女们：“共产党真正好，连我们妇女生孩子的事都关心到了。这回有了新法接生，做妈妈的不用怕过阎王关了！”妇女们当着她面不吭声，背地里却在唧唧哝哝：才去县里学了十天，就吹起牛皮来！
    在她回到村里的第三个晚上，同村妇女莫琼花的妈妈气喘吁吁地找她来了。原来，琼花因为迷信，照例到牛栏里生孩子。因为孩子生不下来，请来的旧产婆束手无策。莫琼花的妈妈着了急，才把莫玉香找来。当莫玉香三步并作两步走到牛栏时，莫琼花已经奄奄一息，旧产婆却要她蹲在地下，说是蹲着孩子才容易出来。邻居的妇女在旁手忙脚乱，准备为她求神驱鬼。莫玉香不顾众人拦阻，赶快将产妇搀扶到床上躺下，用学到的新法为她接生。不一会，孩子生下了，产妇却因为失血过多昏迷过去。“不好了，一定是得罪了
  ‘鬼婆’，生孩子不求‘鬼婆’，别想活了！”在旁的妇女七嘴八舌地嚷着，旧产婆更是气势汹汹地说：“死了人要你担当！”在众口纷纷的责难下，莫玉香确实着急。可是，当她想起自己生第二个孩子时，就是因为听了迷信“鬼婆”的话，在头上放一瓦盆冷水，然后用刀敲破瓦盆，让冷水从头浇下，结果，产后足足患了一个多月产褥病，以后还不时闹头痛。想到这里她不再犹豫了，沉着地继续用学过的新法抢救产妇。产妇终于苏醒了，当她看到新生的婴孩时，禁不住流着眼泪对莫玉香说：“要不是你，我母子都没命了！”
    从这次以后，新法接生的好处，就像长了翅膀在附近一带偏僻的村庄传开了。附近村庄的产妇都把莫玉香当作自己的亲人，莫玉香呢，不管白天黑夜，风大雨骤，都不知疲倦地奔走在各个村庄，给孕妇作产前检查，为产妇接生。
    1958年，人民公社在各个大队办了留产院、托儿所等福利事业，因为这个村子很迷信，认为在村中办产院会压死“龙头”，不吉利，一些地主分子还乘机煽动上中农要打莫玉香，暗中破坏留产院的房子，到处造谣说：“在产院生的孩子是养不活的，生下来就死。”莫玉香向党支部反映了这些情况，同群众一起制止了地主分子的造谣破坏。当时，村子里有小孩患痳疹，她就煎好草药逐家逐户送给病孩吃；见到有重病人，她就不辞辛苦，连夜跑几十里到公社卫生院去请医生。群众被她的忘我精神所感动，原来反对办产院的也不吭声了。可是，新的困难又来了，要办产院，药品和剪刀、钳子等器具都没有，向大队要钱嘛，大队又底子薄，负担不了。怎么办呢？莫玉香一点也不气馁，她动员了和她一起在县里学过新法接生的梁爱梅，两人上山伐木、挖树头，又开荒种番薯。她把砍到的木柴，收到的番薯卖给供销社，加上群众的帮助，筹得七十多元，买了一批药品、纱布和用具，还动员了木工义务为产院制床造凳，修理窗门，就这样，产院开办起来了。
    从去年以来，岩岭大队一百八十多个产妇，全部到这个产院来分娩，母子都平安出院。产妇出院后，莫玉香经常去探望她们。有一个妇女患其他疾病死亡了，剩下一个刚满两个月的婴孩，莫玉香设法动员了五个正在哺乳的妈妈，轮流给这个婴孩哺乳，使这个失掉妈妈的婴孩，健壮地成长起来。队里的社员谈起了这些，都亲切地称玉香为“妇婴的好妈妈”。今年5月，莫玉香当选为全国卫生先进工作者，到北京出席了全国文教群英会。现在，她已经是大队的党支部书记，领导着全大队的生产工作和卫生工作。
