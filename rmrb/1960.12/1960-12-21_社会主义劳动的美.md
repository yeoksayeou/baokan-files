    The Beauty of Socialist Labor
    Ma Tieding

    After reading "The Incident of a Small White Flag" (Ji Xuepei), "Spring Thunder" (Lin Jinlan), "Newly Acquainted Partners" (Wang Wenshi), "Yan'an People" (Du Pengcheng), "Ordinary Laborers" (Wang Yuanjian), "Record of Cultivating Clouds" (Li Zhun), "The Hand That Can't Be Lassoed" (Zhao Shuli), "People with Special Personalities" (Hu Wanchun), "The Battle Mileage" (Xiao Mu), and some other short stories, I have an overall impression: the beauty of labor, beautiful labor.

    These works vividly demonstrate that: exploitation is ugly, and labor is beautiful.

    Labor is the same, but the labor of the new era and the old era, the new society and the old society, are completely different: two different natures, one is conscious, the other is forced; two different labor scenes, labor atmospheres: one is joyful, the other is sad; two different laborers, one is the master of life—the master of society, the master of nature, the other is the slave of life—the slave of society, the slave of nature.

    The socialist and communist labor of the new era and new society leads people to become perfect people with healthy bodies and minds and all-round development.

    I

    Nature is beautiful, and the second nature created by people's omnipotent hands and social labor practice is even more beautiful.

    That is the Thirteen Tombs Reservoir dam in architecture: it is like a large warship docked in the sea, majestic and magnificent.

    That is the scenery on both sides of the Daru River in early spring: wheat seedlings are "exploding from the ridges" and willow branches are fluttering gently.

    That is the running tractor: walking an invincible hero in the blue sky, the black soil, and the boundless high sky and earth...

    Writing a novel is of course not writing poetry, nor is it painting, but these descriptions still give people a feeling of poetry in the painting and painting in the poem.

    This charming scenery with poetry in the painting and painting in the poem does not guide people to escape into the mountains and forests and escape reality. On the contrary, it is precisely from this charming scenery that we see the fighting spirit of the laborers, and see how the laborers transform the world and beautify the earth. …

    This reminds us of bringing running water from the high mountains, building factories on the plains, building green Great Walls in the deserts, opening up wide roads in sparsely populated areas, and turning barren land into fertile fields. … These running water, factories, green Great Walls, wide roads, and fertile fields… not only mean rich material wealth, the development of production, and the improvement of living standards, but also give people spiritual beauty.

    In the history of Chinese literature, works that describe high mountains and flowing water and natural scenery account for a considerable proportion, and many of them describe high mountains and flowing water and natural scenery to express feelings of tranquility, inaction, etherealness, and loneliness. Like "Sitting alone in a secluded bamboo grove, playing the qin and whistling for a long time, no one knows in the deep forest, the bright moon comes to shine." (Wang Wei: "Bamboo Lodge") "In the white clouds of the North Mountain, hermits are happy. Looking at each other and trying to climb high, the heart disappears with the flying geese." (Meng Haoran: "Autumn Climbing Lanshan Sending Zhang Wu") and the like, these works can only guide readers to be passively weary and detached from the world.

    The same is poetry in painting and painting in poetry, one embodies the thoughts and feelings of the working people in the new era, and is active, fighting, and optimistic; the other embodies the thoughts and feelings of the exploiting class in the old era, and is passive, pessimistic, and world-weary.

    Wang Gang, this "alloy steel", this person with special personality, this supply and marketing section chief in a steel factory, is also a painter. He painted the busy and noisy scene on the Bund of the Huangpu River, and he also painted the reflection of the crane in the river... He has an ambition: to paint everything that is most beautiful in the world.

    Wang Gang, this painter, is obviously of dual significance: he is a painter who holds a palette and a paintbrush; at the same time, he is even more a painter who uses his creative labor to realize the ideals of socialism and communism.

    In the latter sense, in a broad understanding, Wang Gang is of course a painter, Ye Junying in "The Incident of a Small White Flag", Tian Yan in "Spring Thunder", Zhang Layue and Wu Shulan in "Newly Acquainted Partners", Hei Chenwei in "Yan'an People", Chen Bingzheng in "The Hand That Can't Be Lassoed", Xiao Shuying in "Record of Cultivating Clouds", Liu Baineng in "The Battle Mileage", Minister Lin and Xiao Li in "Ordinary Laborers", etc. are also painters. It is they who, with their creative labor, transform the world and beautify the earth; it is they who have painted and are painting the newest and most beautiful paintings on the canvas of the motherland, which was once poor and blank.

    Our ancestors, when they evolved from monkeys to humans, or even when they were still monkeys, used their labor practices and struggle practices to promote the progress of the times and the development of society. However, when the working people have not been able to control their own destiny, that labor, to a large extent, is forced, unconscious, and is carried out under the drive of hunger and the whips of the exploiting classes.

    In "The Hand That Can't Be Lassoed", an old man educates young people in this way: Don't look down on my hands covered with calluses. It was these hands that reclaimed a piece of wasteland that had been barren from the third year of Guangxu to the third year of Xuantong, "digging it open hoe by hoe, building up the ridges one by one."

    Yes, without these hands, the wasteland will always be wasteland; without human labor, the fields will never grow grain. However, we also see from the old man's narrative the hardships and tears of engaging in labor under the exploitation of the landlord class... Their labor at that time, although objectively played a role in promoting the progress of the times, they did not have any ambition to transform the world and beautify the earth in their own understanding and subjective motives. It was only forced by hunger and forced to seek a living condition in which the family could barely survive.

    Exploitation has become a thing of the past, and labor has become the social ethos; forced and unconscious slave labor has become a thing of the past, and conscious, idealistic, and proud labor of the masters has become the social ethos.

    The above works accurately and vividly reflect this historical development trend and the characteristics of the times.

    "Nature gives mankind no more than it gives to any other animal. Everything created on the earth—all culture—is created by human labor." (Gorky) In the creative labor of the working people, what miracles will appear.

    How beautiful is the second nature that has been created and transformed by labor;

    How beautiful are the laborers who engage in creative labor!

    II

    Two different labor natures inevitably embody two different labor scenes and labor atmospheres.

    The same is the agricultural labor scene, there are significant differences between when the working people control their own destiny and when they do not.

    In the new era and new society, whether it is the labor scene of tractor spring plowing, the labor scene of weeding wheat, the labor scene on the agricultural training ground, or the labor scene of building the Thirteen Tombs Reservoir, the labor scene of driving a train... there is a common theme: it is tense, warm, and pleasant, and it is the comradely love and cooperation in labor.

    Within this common theme, there are naturally different characteristics: the labor of industrial production is a battle drum, the labor of the reservoir construction site is a magnificent chorus, and the labor of agricultural production is a lyrical pastoral.

    Agricultural labor scenes are often linked to mountains, trees, fields, and pastoral scenery, so they are particularly prone to have pastoral lyricism.

    "The golden setting sun is only a pole high from Pingdingshan. The cool northwest wind rolls the sky into a blue tile color. The Daru River is like a handsome silver dragon, shining brightly under the golden sunlight, passing through the lush green fields and villages, winding eastward...

    From time to time, bursts of silver bell-like laughter came from both sides of the river. Who is singing Yuxi Opera over there? The voice is so clear and loud; who is deliberately pinching the tune and humming Nanyang Diao over here? The voice is so gentle and lingering. Look! It must be those young lads and girls who are hoeing wheat in the fields, in groups to the east, groups to the west, a piece to the south, and a piece to the north, densely packed, how many are there!"

    What a charming scenery, what joyful singing, the air is so beautiful, it seems that you can smell its fragrance and taste its sweetness. Distant mountains, nearby waters, fields, wheat seedlings, light wind, and beautiful sunshine laugh together with the masters—the working people.

    This reminds me of another labor scene, which is also beautifully written. That is the passage in "Red Flag Spectrum" where the Yan brothers work on the two acres of precious land.

    "The two brothers, hoe! hoe! Four small arms swung the large hoe, bending their waists into a complete curve. The dew drops on the small seedlings stained their trouser legs, splashed on their legs, and stained their feet, how comfortable they felt! hoe! hoe! The gourd seedlings opened blue trumpet flowers, hoeing them away. The duckweed flowers showed purple flower spikes, hoeing them away. All the weeds were hoeed away, leaving only the purple-rooted green seedlings of the large rice, growing fat and strong. hoe! hoe! hoe with all their strength."

    This passage and the previous passage, both writing about field labor, but from the comparison, we can see: the different moods of the laborers, and the specific conditions and atmospheres they each have. The former does not give people a feeling of heaviness, even though it is heavy manual labor. The latter vaguely feels the heavy burden on the brothers' shoulders in "hoe! hoe!..." The former is full of laughter, while the latter reveals sadness in the comfort from their love and deep feelings for labor and land. The former is accompanied by loud singing, while the latter is accompanied by the brother telling stories to his younger brother. The story is about the history of displacement of the working people, which the speaker cannot bear to tell and the listener cannot bear to hear. The speaker swallows the tears into his stomach, and the listener turns his head away and secretly wipes away tears.

    Labor, laborers, and the laborers' love for the land are originally beautiful, but in the old society, these beautiful things are suppressed by the ugly feudal system and the feudal landlord class, and cannot be developed smoothly and normally. The more you hate those ugly things, the more you love these beautiful things; the more you hate the old era and the old society, the more you love the new era and the new society.

    In works reflecting the industrial labor scene of the new era and the new society, there is a strong sense of time, a clear sense of rhythm, and strict organization. The spiritual outlook of the characters can be expressed in silence, short conversations, or a certain labor action.

    This, of course, does not mean that workers, like some intellectuals who have not been reformed, like to beat around the bush, hem and haw, and not say what they have to say. The working class is the purest, most frank, and most able to get straight to the point. Their silence, or less speech, is entirely due to the tension of labor.

    Liu Baineng went to Hu Dahai's machine team to "ride along." Hu Dahai is not the kind of person who talks but does not do, talks more and does less. He is the kind of person who talks less and does more, does first and talks later.

    Before Liu Baineng met Hu Dahai, Hu Dahai first heard the sound of Liu Baineng using a small hammer to check the parts under the car.

    Helping people and needing people's help is best done at the critical moment. Liu Baineng's help to Hu Dahai is exactly like this. When it was time to "rush up the slope at high speed," Liu Baineng took the initiative to be Hu Dahai's assistant - burning coal. Just look at him waving the shovel three times in the front and three times in the back, three times fast and three times slow. For a time, the fire was strong and the light was shining.

    Hu Dahai's original assistant - Xiao Zhou was stunned and made him understand how to cherish every piece of coal and how to make every grain of coal powder play its greatest burning function. Hu Dahai is an old driver and also has a lot of skills. He did not think much of Liu Baineng's help. At this time, he could not help but be secretly excited. Then, it started raining heavily. The slope was steep and the road was slippery, and the locomotive could not rush up. It was necessary to spread sand. Unfortunately, the sand spreader had a problem. Liu Baineng, regardless of any danger, walked onto the footboard that was only a foot wide and manually knocked on the sand pipe to let the sand leak down... Without any explanation, Liu Baineng's actions were the best teaching material. It made Hu Dahai realize that he did lack some things compared to Liu Baineng.

    The battle mileage is full of battles, and the reader reads with bated breath, following the ups and downs of the author's emotions. It is so tense and warm: we not only get closer to the hearts of Liu Baineng, Hu Dahai, and Xiao Zhou, but also can't help but feel as if we are one of the fighters, riding on a train speeding.

    The labor of the reservoir construction site is a magnificent chorus: the sound of people, the sound of cars, the sound of trumpets, the sound of machines,... constitute pleasant sounds. In this chorus, there are solos, duets, and chorus, all kinds of things are available. The duet of General Lin and Xiao Li is the most wonderful chapter. One old and one young, one in front and one behind, at the two ends of a carrying pole, accompany the rhythm of carrying soil and sing the socialist and communist labor march.

    The chapters of General Lin and Xiao Li working together are written very well: General Lin is a man who has endured wind and frost and has experienced many battles. He once fought here, and now he has come here to participate in labor, so he has special feelings for this time and place. Although he is old, he inevitably feels tired from the heavy physical labor, but he is more open-minded and happy. He appears among the masses completely as an ordinary laborer, but he is different from the general masses: when it rains heavily, the labor needs strong command even more, and General Lin immediately takes the lead with his exemplary actions, driving everyone to move forward in an orderly manner. Xiao Li is completely a person cultivated by the new era and new society. He has drawn strength from the revolutionary traditions of the older generation, and has been tempered in the new labor and battle. General Lin and Xiao Li embody a completely new type of relationship between people on the common bond of the revolutionary cause: equality, democracy, unity, and friendship, and move forward without hesitation for the realization of a better ideal.

    From Xiao Li's enthusiasm for labor and his sense of being the master, General Lin realized that the revolutionary fighting tradition "exploded with new sparks under new conditions." The relationship between General Lin and Xiao Li is a microcosm of the two generations before and after the development of revolutionary history. In the relay race of the development of revolutionary history, the front waves always start the rear waves, and the rear waves push the front waves. And the forward rush of each wave has made its own contribution to the long river of absolute truth. They are all blooming, large or small, bright flowers in the magnificent cause of human social development.

    Yes, the times are developing, and the motherland is advancing. The socialist and communist labor march accompanies our advancing footsteps; the torch of revolution, in the past, present, and future, will always illuminate our journey.

    III

    Two different labor natures and two different laborers also determine two different attitudes towards nature.

    It is endless fun to fight with the sky; it is endless fun to fight with the earth; it is endless fun to fight with people.

    Xiao Shuying in "Record of Cultivating Clouds" is a hero, a capable person, and a pioneer who dares to fight with the sky, fight with the earth, and fight with people.

    Xiao Shuying is a weather forecaster in the people's commune. Because she forecasts the weather very accurately, she has a very high prestige among the masses, so that everyone has a sentence buried in their hearts: "This little girl is really good!" Her brother Xiao Tongchui originally did not approve of her being a weather forecaster, but later he had to admit defeat in front of the facts, and wrote a big-character poster to praise her.

    Accurate weather forecasting starts from inaccurate.

    The first forecast of frost was inaccurate, and the frost did not come;

    The second forecast of frost, the commune made early preparations, so that tens of thousands of acres of wheat were not damaged.

    The third forecast of rain saved a lot of labor for watering crops;

    The fourth forecast of heavy rain would not reach this area, which exempted the reservoir from digging dikes.

    When the first weather forecast failed, there was a lot of discussion, and rumors came. Xiao Shuying not only had to fight with the sky, but also had to fight with people first.

    Hostile thoughts attacked her. Saying "If a duck can pick up fish, why go to Chenzhou to buy a cormorant," saying "This is the one who manages the Lord of the Sky, eat the big white steamed bun in the commune cafeteria!"

    Backward thinking dragged her back. Her brother stared at her and said, "Shuying, you can't do any work, you have to do this weather forecasting."

    When she was in difficulty, the Party Committee and the Party Secretary supported her. She shed tears. This was not a sign of weakness. She was a very strong person. Her tears were a manifestation of not being able to fulfill her due responsibilities to the Party and her deep feelings for the Party and the socialist cause. She was determined to use her own practice and struggle to recover the first failure.

    The sky, a natural tyrant, suddenly has a severe drought, suddenly has heavy rain, suddenly has a strong wind, and suddenly has frost. People feel that it is unpredictable and difficult to control, so they have the idea of ​​listening to fate;

    The sky, a natural tyrant, although unpredictable, but because people have fought with it for a long time, its regularity and its quirks can be gradually recognized after all, and the methods of controlling it are becoming more and more abundant and perfect, so the idea of ​​"man will conquer nature" has been generated. There are many agricultural proverbs in the mouths of old farmers that reflect the regularity of the weather to a certain extent, such as "Clouds go east, a field of wind blows, clouds go west, Guan Gong rides a horse wearing a raincoat", "Morning glow does not go out, evening glow travels thousands of miles", "East rainbow sunshine west rainbow rain" and so on.

    When the working people were still slaves of the exploiting classes and the exploiting system, when the mode of production was still very primitive, they were also often slaves of nature. Because of their enslavement and exploitation, they are either not interested in fighting with the sky and fighting with the earth - because the fruits of labor are mostly taken away by others anyway; or they lack the time and energy to fight with the sky and fight with the earth; or their intelligence and talents to fight with the sky and fight with the earth cannot be fully developed. Even so: the idea of ​​being the master of nature still moves forward tortuously under a thousand catties of heavy pressure.

    Isn't it? The strong desire to fight with the sky, fight with the earth, and even manage the sky, manage the earth, manage the mountains, and manage the sea has existed very early. Therefore, there are beautiful legends and stories such as Jingwei Filling the Sea, Kuafu Chasing the Sun, and Yugong Moving the Mountain.

    The times are different, and the people are the masters. The idea that man will conquer nature, the idea of ​​managing the sky, managing the earth, managing the mountains, and managing the water, and the idea of ​​being the master of nature have been rationally inherited and carried forward.

    Xiao Shuying, although only a weather forecaster in the commune, is, in terms of ideological quality, a rare model embodying the idea of ​​being the master of nature!

    The scene of Xiao Shuying standing on the top of Yushan: rather than saying that her eyes are watching and her ears are listening to the strong wind, heavy rain, lightning and thunder under Yushan, it is better to say that she is riding on that natural tyrant.

    "Order the Three Mountains and Five Ridges to open the way, I'm coming." That "I" character is composed of thousands upon thousands of laborers and thousands upon thousands of people like Xiao Shuying!

    Tian Yan drives a tractor, deep plowing fertile soil, to demand more and more rewards from the earth; Liu Baineng and Hu Dahai drive a train, breaking through the strong wind and heavy rain to climb a high slope; people building the Thirteen Tombs Reservoir, want to turn water disasters into water conservancy, and so on, is a high degree of carrying forward the idea of ​​being the master of nature, and is a brilliant flower of socialist and communist labor blooming!

    One type of person only sees the gentle side of nature with thousands of mountains competing for beauty, thousands of valleys competing for flow, spring sunshine, birds singing, and flowers fragrant; but does not see that nature is also a fierce god on the other side.

    Another type of person is frightened by the fierce god side of nature. Believing that people should only be slaves to nature.

    The working people, armed with revolutionary ideas and liberated, see both the gentle side of nature, making it serve our production and life; and bravely fight against the fierce god side of nature, turning harm into benefit.

    From the above works, we see the beauty of nature, and even more see the beauty of fighting with nature, the beauty of being brave and hardworking!

    IV

    Socialist and communist labor is cultivating a new type of person - a perfect person who combines physical labor and mental labor, and is healthy in body and mind.

    The concept of private ownership is connected to the idea of ​​exploitation, while the concept of labor is connected to the idea of ​​socialism and communism.

    Collective labor cooperation is most helpful in cultivating collectivist spirit.

    The above works have created a series of vivid images with collectivist spirit and socialist and communist ideas.

    Hei Chenwei and Hei Laotaitai in "Yan'an People" directly attacked the enemy on the battlefield during the war, and transported military food and carried stretchers in the rear, actively supporting the front line, and dedicating themselves to winning the victory of the revolutionary war; in peacetime, they dedicated themselves to the cause of socialist construction. Hei Chenwei is the material director of the railway construction site, going to Xi'an, running to Hankou, going to Shanghai, and going to the Northeast, braving the wind and rain, working hard and bearing hardships. It seems that he is a taciturn and slow-witted person. In essence, it is not slow-witted at all: Where are the materials? Where are there no materials? How much material is needed? How to solve it? Clear as a bell, crystal clear. He is an old man, but when he encounters labor, he is full of energy, just like a young man, rushing onto the car, jumping down again, waving his hands, shouting, and the shouting overwhelms the sound of people and machines on the construction site. He is full of energy and full of strength in everything that belongs to the collective interest. Hei Laotaitai, like Hei Chenwei, has a high sense of responsibility for the revolutionary cause and national property. She lives in a thatched shed near the material warehouse, and as soon as there is a little sound at night, she immediately opens her eyes. Hei Chenwei and Hei Yongliang are father and son, and Hei Yongliang and Hei Chenwei are superiors and subordinates. As a father-son relationship, Hei Chenwei loves Hei Yongliang, and vice versa, Hei Yongliang respects Hei Chenwei. But as a superior-subordinate relationship, Hei Chenwei respects Hei Yongliang's leadership, and Hei Yongliang makes strict demands on Hei Chenwei according to the needs of the work. Here, not only is the comrade relationship engaged in the revolutionary cause and the father-son relationship between families completely consistent, but the family relationship is melted into the revolutionary feeling. The comrade love combined by the revolutionary war and socialist construction and the father-son love between families are infiltrated into an eternal and unbreakable alloy of love. This alloy will be passed down for thousands of years as a new virtue. It is Hei Chenwei, Hei Laotaitai, Hei Yongliang... and thousands of laborers and their cadres who support my country's mountains and rivers with their shoulders.

    The old man Chen Bingzheng has a pair of "hands that can't be lassoed." The reason why this hand cannot be lassoed is, firstly, because he is used to labor and cannot be idle; secondly, and more importantly, because socialist and communist elements have been added to his thinking. Isn't it good to do some light work in the nursing home? He is not satisfied and wants to come out to participate in field labor. He takes on the labor coach leader, with a spirit of responsibility for the collective cause, demanding strictness and meticulousness; he was asked to go to the temple fair, which was originally for him to relax, but he bought back a large number of mulberry forks; he lives in the county town guest house, and there is still half a day before he can go home, he sees the wood blocking the way and doesn't like it, he has to move it away himself. In short, he has to take care of serious matters, leisure matters, and matters related to the collective.

    Liu Baineng sacrificed his rest time and risked his life to help his comrades successfully complete the driving task.

    Hei Chenwei, Hei Laotaitai, Chen Bingzheng, Liu Baineng, etc., are naturally all ordinary people, and it is these people that the cause of socialist construction has become a part of their flesh and blood.

    Socialist labor also helps people to become cheerful, heroic, and strong. Zhang Layue in "Newly Acquainted Partners" is bold and unrestrained, laughing loudly when happy, and angry when angry, full of youthful vitality. Wu Shulan was originally that kind of "good woman" who never left her house, with a smile on her face, gentle and elegant. However, collective labor tempered her, and socialist ideas inspired her. Zhang Layue's character immediately had a subtle influence on her. The cheerful and heroic nature that has experienced wind and frost and seen the world has gradually increased in Wu Shulan's gentle and elegant character.

    The shift and change of Wu Shulan's character marks one thing:

    After the female labor force is liberated from the family, in the practice of tempering, the strengthening of confidence, the improvement of ability, and the potential power buried for thousands of years began to erupt. It is impossible to predict how much effect it will have.

    Labor has beautified people's minds and also beautified people's bodies.

    What kind of people are the above vivid images? Almost everyone is both red and black, with developed muscles, strong and healthy.

    Liu Baineng is strong and well-proportioned, a burly black man.

    Wang Gang is rugged and strong, with sharp eyes, and two muscles bulging like steamed buns on his shoulders.

    Xiao Shuying is tall, slender and strong, with black hair and a pair of handsome eyes.

    Zhang Layue has round shoulders, a red face, and a bold look in her eyes and eyebrows.

    Wu Shulan has dark skin, an oval face, and is handsome.

    As the saying goes: "Clumsy hands and feet", as if healthy and plump hands and feet are destined to be linked to clumsiness. That is inaccurate. On the contrary, due to labor, healthy hands and feet and flexible joints are often particularly ingenious.

    Engels said: "The hand is not only an organ of labor, but also a product of labor. Only through labor, through adapting to ever-changing actions, through the inheritance of the particularly developed degree of muscles, ligaments and - after a longer process - bones thus achieved, and through the continuous improvement of these inherited improved results applied to increasingly complex new actions - only through all this, has the human hand reached such a high degree of perfection that it seems to produce Raphael's paintings, Thorvaldsen's sculptures, and Paganini's music by magic." ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels" Volume 2, pages 81-82)

    Which of the above heroic images is clumsy? Isn't each of them dexterous? Look, Chen Bingzheng's hands covered with calluses are extremely meticulous when doing fine work. The "call brother" cage he made of sorghum stalks has doors and windows, and is divided into upstairs and downstairs. Every small hole in the various patterned window lattices on the windows cannot even be drilled through by a bee.

    In class society, due to the separation of mental labor and physical labor, they often develop in two畸形 directions.

    Laborers, due to excessive physical exertion under the exploiting system, and at the same time, being deprived of the opportunity and conditions to obtain culture, they often beautify the world, but they become畸形 (for example, bearing a heavy burden that exceeds their physical capacity, turning into a hunched waist). This is one aspect, on the other hand, exploiters and intellectuals become neurasthenic and weak in the limbs due to being far away from physical labor.

    "The beauties of the upper class are completely different: her successive ancestors have lived without laboring with their hands; due to a life of idleness, blood rarely flows to the limbs, and the muscles of the hands and feet are weaker from generation to generation, and the bones are getting smaller and smaller; and the inevitable result is slender hands and feet... Due to idleness, blood stays in the central organs and flows to the brain;... all the inevitable results are constant headaches and various nervous diseases." (Chernyshevsky: "Life and Aesthetics" pages 7-8)

    The combination of physical labor and mental labor promotes people's physical and mental health, so as to develop in a balanced and all-round way.

    Tian Yan, Xiao Shuying, Liu Shengji, etc., this generation of young people, are a new type of laborers, they are people with healthy bodies, and also people with healthy minds.

    They have occupied and will continue to occupy an important position in our literary works. Their full and vivid images will have a huge infectious effect on thousands upon thousands of readers.

    Gorky once said: "The labor process transformed upright animals into humans, and created the fundamental basis of culture; the role of this labor process has never been studied in a comprehensive and in-depth manner. This is natural, because such research is not in the interests of labor exploiters, who turn the energy of the masses into currency as a raw material, and of course cannot increase the value of raw materials here." ("Selected Essays on Literature" page 391)

    Labor exploiters will never make a correct estimate of the role of labor and laborers. Writers in the new era are writers of the working people and spokespersons for the working people. They should reflect and fully evaluate the huge contributions made by labor and laborers to promoting historical progress. Our writer comrades are also working hard in this way. Thousands of readers expect our writer comrades to move forward in this direction, to establish and develop new aesthetic views, and to spur their horses to create more and better full, colorful, and vivid images of creative labor.

    社会主义劳动的美
    马铁丁
    我读了《一面小白旗的风波》（吉学霈）、《春雷》（林斤澜）、《新结识的伙伴》（王汶石）、《延安人》（杜鹏程）、《普通劳动者》（王愿坚）、《耕云记》（李准）、《套不住的手》（赵树理）、《特殊性格的人》（胡万春）、《战斗的里程》（萧木），还有其他若干篇短篇小说之后，给我一个总的印象是：劳动的美，美的劳动。
    从这些作品中生动地体现了：剥削是丑的，劳动是美的。
    同是劳动，新时代与旧时代，新社会与旧社会的劳动，则又截然不同：两种不同的性质，一个是自觉的，一个是被迫的；两种不同的劳动场面、劳动气氛：一个是欢乐的，一个是愁苦的；两种不同的劳动者，一个是生活的主人——社会的主人，自然的主人，一个是生活的奴隶——社会的奴隶，自然的奴隶。
    新时代、新社会的社会主义、共产主义劳动导致人们成为身心健康、全面发展的完美的人。
    一
    自然是美的，经过人的万能的双手，社会的劳动实践所创造出来的第二自然更美。
    那就是在建筑中的十三陵水库大坝：它仿佛是一只停泊在海里的大军舰，雄伟壮丽。
    那就是早春天气大汝河两岸的景色：麦苗“炸垅”，柳条轻飘。
    那就是运转着的拖拉机：在蓝蓝的天，黑黑的土，无边无沿的高天大地之间，走着一个无敌英雄……
    写小说当然不是写诗，也不是画画，但是，在这些描写里仍然使人有着诗中有画，画中有诗的感觉。
    这诗中有画、画中有诗的迷人景色，并不是引导人们去遁迹山林，逃避现实。正相反，我们正是从这迷人的景色中，看到劳动者的战斗的风貌，看到劳动者如何改造世界，美化大地。……
    这使我们联想起高山上引来了流水，平地上建立起工厂，沙漠中筑起绿色的长城，人迹罕至之区开辟了宽广的大道，荒原变成了万顷良田。……这流水、工厂、绿色长城、宽广的大道、万顷良田……不仅意味着丰厚的物质财富，意味着生产的发展、生活水平的提高，而且给予人们精神上的美的享受。
    在我国文学史上，那种写高山流水、自然风光的作品占了相当比重，其中又有不少是在描写高山流水、自然风光中寄托以清静、无为、飘逸、孤独的感情。像“独坐幽篁里，弹琴复长啸，深林人不知，明月来相照。”（王维：《竹里馆》）“北山白云里，隐者自怡悦。相望试登高，心随雁飞灭。”（孟浩然：《秋登兰山寄张五》）之类，这些作品只能引导读者消极厌倦，超然人世。
    同是诗中有画，画中有诗，一个体现着新时代劳动人民的思想感情，是积极的、战斗的、乐观的；另一个体现着旧时代剥削阶级的思想感情，是消极的、悲观的、厌世的。
    王刚，这位“合金钢”，这位特殊性格的人，这位钢铁工厂里的供销科长，同时又是一位画家。他画了黄浦江畔的繁忙喧闹的场面，他又画了江水中的吊车的倒影……他有一个抱负：画一切世界上最美好的东西。
    王刚这位画家显然是双重意义的：他是拿调色板、拿画笔的画家；同时，他更是用自己创造性劳动去实现社会主义、共产主义理想的画家。
    在后一个意义上，在广义的理解上，王刚固然是画家，《一面小白旗的风波》里的叶俊英，《春雷》里的田燕，《新结识的伙伴》里的张腊月、吴淑兰，《延安人》里的黑成威，《套不住的手》里的陈秉正，《耕云记》里的萧淑英，《战斗的里程》里的刘百能，《普通劳动者》里的林部长、小李等等也都是画家。是他们，以自己创造性的劳动，改造世界，美化大地；是他们，在祖国这幅又穷又白的画布上，已经画出和正在画出最新最美的画。
    我们的祖先，当从猴子变成人的时候起，甚至可以说当还是猴子的年代，就用自己劳动的实践、斗争的实践，去推动时代的前进，社会的发展。但是，当劳动的人们还没有能够主宰自己命运的时候，那劳动，在很大程度上是被迫的，不自觉的，是在饥饿、在剥削阶级的鞭子驱策下去进行的。
    在《套不住的手》中，一位老年人这样教育青年：你不要看不起我这双满生茧皮的手，就是这双手，把光绪三年一直荒到宣统三年的一片荒地，“一钁头一钁头剜开，一条堰一条堰垒起来的。”
    不错，没有这双手，荒地永远是荒地；没有人的劳动，田里决然长不出粮食来。然而，我们也从这位老人的叙述中看到：在地主阶级剥削下从事劳动的辛酸和眼泪……他们那时劳动，尽管在客观上也起了推动时代前进的作用，他们在自己的认识上、主观动机上并没有什么改造世界、美化大地的雄心壮志，那仅仅是迫于饥饿，迫于求得一家大小能够勉强活下去的生活条件。
    剥削成为过去，劳动成为社会的风尚；被迫的、不自觉的奴隶劳动已成过去，而自觉的、有理想的、充满着自豪感的主人翁劳动，成为社会的风尚。
    上述这些作品准确地、形象地反映了这个历史发展趋向和时代特点。
    “自然界给与人类的，并不比给予任何其他动物的多。大地上所创造出来的一切——全部文化都是人的劳动所创造的。”（高尔基）在劳动人民创造性的劳动中，那是什么奇迹都会出现的。
    为劳动所创造、所变形了的第二自然是何等的美；
    从事创造性劳动的劳动者又是何等的美呵！
    二
    两种不同的劳动性质，必然体现出两种不同的劳动场面，劳动气氛。
    同是农业劳动场面，劳动人民掌握了自己命运的时候和没有掌握自己命运的时候，则又有着显著的不同。
    而在新时代、新社会里无论是拖拉机春耕的劳动场面，无论是锄麦草的劳动场面，无论是在农业教练场上的劳动场面，也无论是建筑十三陵水库的劳动场面，开火车的劳动场面……有一个共同的基调：是紧张的、热烈的、愉快的，是劳动中同志式的友爱和协作。
    在这个共同的基调中，自然又各具特色：工业生产的劳动是战斗的擂鼓，水库工地的劳动是壮丽的大合唱，农业生产劳动是抒情的牧歌。
    农业劳动场面，往往是和山川树木，田野风光联系在一起的，因此，特别容易具有牧歌式的抒情色彩。
    “金闪闪的晚阳，离平顶山只一杆高了。凉嗖嗖的西北风卷得天空一片瓦蓝色。大汝河像一条俊俏的银龙一样，在金黄色的阳光照耀下，明闪闪的穿过葱绿的田野、村庄，弯弯曲曲向东流去……
    河两岸，不时传来一阵银铃似的欢笑声。是谁在那边唱起豫西梆子来了，嗓子是那么清脆而且响亮；是谁又在这边故意捏着腔哼起了南阳大调，声音是这样柔顺又缠绵。看吧！准是那些正在地里锄麦的年轻小伙子和姑娘们，东一群，西一群，南一片，北一片，黑鸦鸦的，看有多少呵！”
    好迷人的景色，好欢乐的歌唱，空气又这般美好，仿佛可以嗅得出它的芬芳，?得出它的甜味。远山近水，田垅麦苗，轻风丽日同主人翁——劳动着的人们一同欢笑。
    这使我想起了另一个劳动场面，也是写得很美的。那就是《红旗谱》中严氏兄弟在二亩宝地上劳动的一段。
    “哥儿俩，耪呀！耪呀！四条小胳膊抡着大锄，把腰猫了个对头弯。小苗上的露珠沾在裤角上，溅到腿上，沾在脚上，他们觉得多么舒坦！耪呀！耪呀！药葫芦苗，开着蓝色的小喇叭花，耪了去。水萍花，秀出紫色的花穗，耪了去。把野草都耪了去，光剩下紫根绿苗的大秧谷，长得肥肥的，壮壮的。耪呀，一股劲儿耪。”
    这一段同前一段，同是写田野劳动，却从对比中看到：劳动者的不同的心境，各自所具有的特定的条件和气氛。同是繁重的手工操作劳动，前者给予人的却没有繁重的感觉。后者在“耪呀！耪呀……”中隐隐感到压在哥儿俩肩上的沉重的负担；同是对劳动、对土地的热爱和深厚的感情，前者是一片欢笑，后者在舒坦中又流露出辛酸。前者伴随着劳动的是放声歌唱，后者伴随着劳动的是哥哥对弟弟讲故事。讲的是讲者不忍讲下去、听者不忍听下去的劳动人民的流离失所史。讲者讲着讲着，把眼泪咽到肚里去，听者听着听着，别过头去偷偷的擦眼泪。
    劳动、劳动者、劳动者对土地的爱，本来是美好的，但是，在旧社会里，这些美好的事物，受到丑恶的封建制度，封建地主阶级所压抑，得不到顺利的、正常的发展。你越是对那些丑恶的事物恨，也就越是对这些美好的事物爱，你越是对旧时代、旧社会恨，也就越是对新时代、新社会爱。
    在反映新时代、新社会工业劳动场面的作品里，有着强烈的时间感，鲜明的节奏感，严密的组织性。可以在默默无言中，简短的对话中，某一个劳动动作中表现出人物的精神面貌。
      这当然不是说，工人像某些未经改造的知识分子那样，欢喜转弯抹角，吞吞吐吐，有话不讲，工人阶级是最纯真的、最坦率的，最能开门见山的。他们的不讲话，或少讲话，完全是由于劳动紧张的缘故。
    刘百能到胡大海机班“添乘”去了。胡大海不是那种说而不做，多说少做的人，他是少说多做，先做后说的人。
    刘百能还没有和胡大海见面，胡大海就首先听到刘百能在车底下用小榔头检查机件的声音。
    帮助人和需要人的帮助，最好是在节骨眼上、刀口上。刘百能帮助胡大海正是这样的。要“高速闯坡”了，刘百能主动地做胡大海的助手——烧煤。只看他前三锹后三锹，紧三锹慢三锹地挥舞起来。一时间火头旺盛，光焰闪闪。
    胡大海原来的助手——小周看得惊呆，使他懂得要怎样爱惜每一块煤炭，懂得要怎样才能使每一粒煤粉都发挥最大的燃烧功能。胡大海是个老司机，也有一身本领，他对刘百能的帮助，是不以为然的。这时，也不能不暗暗激动。接着，噼哩叭啦下起大雨来了。坡陡路滑，机车冲不上去。需要撒砂。不巧，撒砂器偏偏出了毛病。刘百能又不顾任何危险，走到一尺来宽的踏脚板上，人工敲砂管，让砂子漏下去……不用什么说明，刘百能的行动是最好的教材，它使胡大海认识到：自己的确比刘百能少了一些东西。
    战斗的里程充满着战斗，读者也是随着作者感情的起伏，屏着呼吸读下去的。是如此紧张、热烈：我们不仅同刘百能、胡大海、小周的心贴得更紧了，而且情不自禁地仿佛自己就是战斗者中的一员，同乘一列火车飞驰。
    水库工地的劳动是壮丽的大合唱：人声、车声、喇叭声、机器声，……构成悦耳的音响。在这大合唱中有独唱、有对唱、有齐唱，色色俱全。林将军和小李的对唱，是最最精彩的一章。一老一小，一前一后，在一条扁担的两头，伴随着抬土的节拍，唱出社会主义、共产主义的劳动进行曲。
    林将军和小李那些共同劳动的章节，写得非常出色：林将军是个饱受风霜，身经百战的人，他曾经在这里战斗过，现在又到这里参加劳动，因此，对此时此地有着特别的感情。虽然年迈了，对繁重的体力劳动，不免感到累人，心境却倍加开朗和愉快。他完全以普通劳动者的身份出现在群众中，但和一般群众又有所不同：大雨来了，劳动上更需要有坚强的指挥，林将军又立刻以自己模范行动，带动着大家有条不紊的前进。小李则完全是新时代、新社会培养出来的人，他在老一辈的革命传统中吸取了力量，又在新的劳动、战斗中受到了锻炼。林将军和小李在革命事业这条共同的纽带上，体现着完全新型的人与人的关系：平等、民主、团结、友爱，并为美好理想的实现，一往直前。
    从小李的劳动热忱中、主人翁的自觉感中，林将军觉察到：革命的战斗传统，“在新的条件下爆发出新的火花”。林将军和小李的关系，是革命历史发展中前后两代的一个缩影。在革命历史发展的接力赛跑中，总是前浪启后浪，后浪推前浪。而每个浪头的向前奔腾而去，都是在绝对真理的长河中作出了自己的贡献。都是在人类社会发展的壮丽事业中所盛开着的或大或小的鲜艳之花。
    是的，时代在发展，祖国在前进。社会主义、共产主义的劳动进行曲，伴奏着我们前进的脚步；革命的火炬，过去、现在、将来，永远照亮了我们的行程。
    三
    两种不同的劳动性质，两种不同的劳动者，也决定着对自然的两种不同的态度。
    与天斗，其乐无穷；与地斗，其乐无穷；与人斗，其乐无穷。
    《耕云记》里的萧淑英，就是一个敢于与天斗、与地斗、与人斗的英雄、能人、闯将。
    萧淑英是人民公社的气象员，由于她预报天气非常准确，因此在群众中的威信极高，以至每个人心里都埋着一句话：“这小姑娘真行！”她的哥哥萧铜锤原来是不赞成她当气象员的，后来也不能不在事实前面服输，而且写了大字报表扬她。
    预报天气准确，是从不准确开始的。
    第一次预报霜冻，不准确，霜冻没有来；
    第二次预报霜冻，公社及早作了防预，使几万亩麦子没有受到损失。
    第三次预报下雨，节省了大批浇庄稼的劳动力；
    第四次预报大雨到不了这个地区，免除了水库挖堤。
      当第一次预报天气失败的时候，议论纷纷，风言风语就来了。萧淑英不仅要与天斗，而且首先要与人斗。
    敌对的思想，打击她。说什么“鸭子要能叼鱼，何必上陈州买鱼鹰”，说什么“这就是管天老爷哩，吃公社食堂那大白蒸馍吧！” 
    落后的思想，拖她的后腿。她哥瞪着眼睛对她说：“淑英，你什么工作干不了，要干这个报天气。”
    当她在困难的时候，是党委会、党委书记支持了她。她流泪了，这并不是示弱，她是一个很刚强的人，她的流泪，是感到没有能够对党尽到应尽责任，是对党、对社会主义事业深厚感情的流露。她决心用自己的实践、斗争来挽回第一次的失败。
    天，自然暴君，忽而大旱、忽而大雨，忽而狂风、忽而霜冻，人们感到它变幻无常，难以驾驭，因此，产生了听天由命的思想；
    天，自然暴君，虽然是变幻无常的，但是，由于人们与它作过长期的斗争，它的规律性、它的怪脾气毕竟是能逐步认识的，制服它的办法也是越来越丰富、越来越完善的，因此，产生了“人定胜天”的思想。老农口中就有许多农谚在一定程度上反映了天气的规律性，例如“云往东，刮场风，云往西，关公骑马披蓑衣”、“早霞不出门，晚霞行千里”、“东虹日头西虹雨”等等。
    劳动人民当他们还是剥削阶级、剥削制度的奴隶的时候，当生产方式还是十分原始的时候，也往往是自然界的奴隶。由于他们的受奴役、受剥削，或则对与天斗、与地斗不感兴趣——因为劳动果实，反正大部被别人夺去；或则缺乏与天斗、与地斗的时间和力量；或则与天斗、与地斗的聪明、才智得不到充分的发展。即使这样：做自然界主人翁的思想，仍然在千斤重压下源远流长地曲折前进。
    可不是吗？与天斗、与地斗、以至管天、管地、管山、管海的强烈愿望，那是很早很早就有了的。因此，有精卫填海、夸父追日、愚公移山那样优美的传说和故事。
    时代不同了，人民当家作主了。人定胜天的思想，管天管地管山管水的思想，做自然界主人翁
  的思想，获得了合理的继承与发扬光大。
    萧淑英，虽然仅仅是个公社的气象员，然而，从思想品质上说，她是一个体现着做自然界主人翁思想的难能可贵的典型！
    萧淑英站在玉山顶上的一幕：与其说她眼睛看着、耳朵听着玉山下面的大风大雨、电闪雷鸣，倒不如说她骑在那个自然暴君身上。
      “喝令三山五岭开道，我来了。”那个“我”字，正是由千千万万个劳动者、千千万万个像萧淑英那样的人组成的！
    田燕驾驶着拖拉机，深翻沃土，要向大地索取更多、更多的报酬；刘百能、胡大海开着火车，突破大风大雨闯上高坡；建筑十三陵水库的人们，要变水患为水利，如此等等，是做自然界主人翁思想的高度发扬，是盛开着的社会主义、共产主义劳动的灿烂之花！
    一种人只看到千山竞秀、万壑争流，春光明媚、鸟语花香的自然界的柔和一面；而没有看到自然界同时又是凶神恶煞的另一面。
    另一种人为自然界的凶神恶煞的一面所吓倒。认为人们只应该做自然界的奴隶。
    为革命思想所武装的劳动人民，解放了的劳动人民，既看到自然界柔和的一面，使它为我们的生产、生活服务；又勇于与自然界凶神恶煞的另一面进行斗争，变有害为有利。
    从上述这些作品中，我们看到自然界的美，更加看到与自然界进行斗争的美，勇敢而又勤劳的美！
    四
    社会主义、共产主义劳动正在培养着一种新型的人——体力劳动与脑力劳动相结合的、身心健康的完美的人。
    私有制观念是和剥削思想相通的，劳动观念则是和社会主义、共产主义思想相通的。
    集体的劳动协作，最有助于培养集体主义精神。
    上述这些作品，创造了一系列有集体主义精神，有社会主义、共产主义思想的生动形象。
    《延安人》里的黑成威、黑老太太，在战争时期，战场上直接打击敌人，在后方运军粮、担担架，积极支援前线，全力献身于争取革命战争的胜利；在和平时期，又全力献身于社会主义建设事业。黑成威是铁路工地材料主任，走西安，跑汉口，去上海，到东北，风里来雨里去，任劳任怨。看起来，他是个沉默寡言，脑筋迟钝的人。实质上一点不迟钝：哪里有材料？哪里无材料？哪里需要材料多少？怎么解决？心里雪亮，清清楚楚。他是个有了年纪的人，可是，一遇上劳动，生龙活虎，简直就是一个小伙子，嗖地窜上汽车，咚地又跳了下来，手挥着，口喊着，喊声压倒了工地人声和机器声。凡属于集体利益的事，他都是精力贯注，满身是劲。黑老太太同黑成威一样，对革命事业，国家资财，怀着高度的责任感。她就住在材料仓库附近的茅棚里，夜晚有一点声音，她就立刻睁开了眼睛。黑成威与黑永良是父子关系，黑永良与黑成威又是上下级关系。作为父子关系，黑成威爱黑永良，反之，黑永良尊敬黑成威。但是作为上下级关系，黑成威尊重黑永良的领导，而黑永良对黑成威则按工作的需要，提出严格的要求。在这里，不仅是从事革命事业的同志感情与家庭之间的父子感情，完全一致，而且是家庭感情溶化在革命感情里。由革命战争中、社会主义建设中所结合起来的同志爱，和家庭之间的父子爱，渗透为永恒的、牢不可破的爱的合金。这合金将作为一种新的美德万古流传。是黑成威、黑老太太、黑永良……千万劳动者及其干部用自己的肩膀，支撑着我国的万里江山。
    陈秉正老汉有着一双“套不住的手”。这手，之所以套不住，一来固然是由于劳动惯了的，闲不下来；二来，更由于他的思想里，加进了社会主义、共产主义的成份。在敬老院里，做些轻微的劳动不是很好吗？他不过瘾，要走出来参加田间劳动。他担负劳动教练组长，以对集体事业负责的精神，要求严格，一丝不苟；要他逛庙会，本来是让他去散散心的，他却买回了大批桑杈；住在县城招待所里，还有半天就该回家了，他看见横梗去路的木头，就不顺眼，非得亲自把它搬掉。总之，正事、闲事、有关集体的事，他都得管。
    刘百能牺牲休息的时间，冒着生命的危险，帮助战友胜利地完成行车任务。
    黑成威、黑老太太、陈秉正、刘百能等等，自然都是平平常常的人，就是这些人，社会主义建设事业已经成为他们血肉的一部分。
    社会主义劳动，还帮助人们性格爽朗、豪迈、坚强起来。《新结识的伙伴》里那个张腊月、泼泼辣辣，乐则大笑，愤则大怒，满身是青春的活力。吴淑兰原是个足不出户的那种“好女人”，嘴挂微笑，温文尔雅。可是，集体的劳动锻炼着她，社会主义思想感召着她，张腊月的性格，马上在她身上发生了潜移默化的作用。在吴淑兰温文尔雅的性格中，逐渐增添了经过风霜、见过世面的爽朗和豪迈。
    吴淑兰性格的推移和改变，标明了一件事：
    妇女劳动力从家庭解放出来之后，在实践的锻炼中，信心的加强，能力的提高，埋藏着几千年的潜在力量，开始爆发出来。它将会发生多大的作用，那是非所逆料的。
    劳动，美化了人们的心灵，也美化了人们的体态。
    上述那些生动形象，又都是些什么人呢？几乎个个都是又红又黑，肌肉发达、结实健康。
    刘百能，长得又结实又匀称，是个魁梧的黑大汉。
    王刚，长得粗犷、结实，有一双尖锐的眼睛，两肩上面，还有两块像馒头似的隆起来的肌肉。
    萧淑英，高高身材，修长健壮，头发乌黑，一双俊眼。
    张腊月，圆肩头，红喷喷的脸，眉里眼里露出了泼辣的神情。
    吴淑兰，肤色微黑，瓜子形脸庞，长得俊秀。
    俗话说：“粗手笨脚”，仿佛手脚健康、丰满，注定要和粗、笨联在一起。那是不确切的。正相反，由于劳动，手脚健康，关节灵活，也就往往特别机巧。
    恩格斯说：“手不但是劳动的器官，并且是劳动的产物。只有由于劳动，由于要适应日新月异的动作，由于把这样达到的筋肉、韧带以及——经过更长久的过程——骨胳特别发达程度遗传下来，而且由于不断改进地把这些遗传下来的改进成果应用于愈益复杂的新动作上——只是由于这一切，人类的手才达到了这样高度完善的地步，以至仿佛是凭着一种魔力产生出拉菲尔的油画，托尔瓦尔德孙的雕塑，巴加尼尼的音乐。”（《马克思恩格斯文选》第二卷81—82页）
    上述这些英雄形象，有哪一个粗笨？难道不正是个个心灵手巧吗？看吧，陈秉正那双满生茧皮的手，做起细活来，又是细到家的。他用高粱秆子扎成的“叫哥哥”笼子，有门有窗，而且又分楼上楼下，窗上的各种图案的窗格子，每个小窟窿，连个蜜蜂也是钻不过去的。
    在阶级社会里，由于脑力劳动与体力劳动的分离，往往向两个畸形的方向发展。
    劳动者，由于在剥削制度下，过度的体力消耗，同时，又被剥夺了获取文化的机会与条件，他们常常美化了世界，而自己变成了畸形（例如肩负超过体力所难能负担的重压，变为弓腰），这是一方面，另一方面剥削者，知识分子，由于远离体力劳动，弄成神经衰弱，四肢无力。
    “上流社会的美人就完全不同了：她的历代祖先都是不靠双手劳动而生活过来的；由于无所事事的生活，血液很少流到四肢去，手足的筋肉一代弱似一代，骨胳也愈来愈小；而其必然的结果是纤细的手足……由于无所事事，血液停留在中枢器官里，流到脑里去；……这一切的不可避免的结果就是经常的头痛和各种神经的疾病。”（车尔尼雪夫斯基：《生活与美学》7—8页）
    体力劳动与脑力劳动的结合，促使人们身心健康，从而均衡的、全面的发展。
    田燕、萧淑英、刘升级等等，这批青年的一代，是新型的劳动者，他们是身体健康的人，也是思想健康的人。
    他们已经、并将继续在我们的文艺作品中占有重要的位置。他们的丰满、生动的形象，将对千千万万的读者发生巨大的感染作用。
    高尔基曾说过：“劳动过程把直立的动物变成了人，并且创造了文化的根本的始基；这种劳动过程的作用，从未得到应有的全面而深刻的研究。这是自然的，因为这样的研究对于劳动剥削者是没有利益的，劳动剥削者把群众的精力当作一种原料变成货币，在这里当然不能提高原料价值。”（《文学论文选》391页）
    劳动的剥削者，决不会对劳动、劳动者的作用作出正确的估计的。新时代的作家是劳动人民的作家，是劳动人民的代言人，理应反映和充分评价劳动、劳动者对推动历史前进所作出的巨大贡献。我们的作家同志也正是这样努力的。千万读者期待着我们的作家同志循此方向前进，为树立和发展新的美学观点，为创造越多越好的、富有创造性劳动的丰满、多采的生动形象而策马加鞭。
