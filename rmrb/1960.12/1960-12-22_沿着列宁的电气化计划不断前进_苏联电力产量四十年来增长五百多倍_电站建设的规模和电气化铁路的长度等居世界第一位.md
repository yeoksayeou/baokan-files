Lenin's Quotes on Electrification
    Communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country, because it is impossible to revitalize industry without electrification.
    (Collected Works of Lenin, Volume 31, Page 380)
    Only when the country has achieved electrification, and laid the technical foundation of modern large-scale industry for industry, agriculture and transportation, can we achieve complete victory.
   (Collected Works of Lenin, Volume 31, Page 469)

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 21st: December 21st marks the fortieth anniversary of the adoption of the "All-Russian Electrification Plan" by the Eighth All-Russian Congress of Soviets in 1920. Over the past forty years, the Soviet Union has made brilliant achievements in developing the electric power industry and realizing nationwide electrification.

    Currently, the Soviet Union's electricity production has increased more than 580 times compared to when the "All-Russian Electrification Plan" began to be implemented in 1921, equivalent to more than 33 times the power generation stipulated in the plan to be achieved within ten to fifteen years. In terms of the growth of the total generating capacity of power stations nationwide, the generating capacity of the new power stations built and put into production in the Soviet Union this year alone is more than twice as high as the total increase in generating capacity of power stations nationwide originally planned in the plan within ten to fifteen years.

    At present, electricity consumption in Soviet industry has increased to about more than fifty times that of 1928. In agriculture, almost all state farms and about two-thirds of collective farms have been electrified. The length of electrified railways nationwide has reached 13,700 kilometers. The unified national power grid, which is of great significance for realizing nationwide electrification, is being rapidly established. Currently, the Soviet Union has far surpassed all economically developed capitalist countries in the scale of power station and transmission line construction, in the length of electrified railways and transmission lines, and in the manufacturing of large generators, ranking first in the world.

    The "All-Russian Electrification Plan" was formulated under the personal guidance of V.I. Lenin. The plan stipulated that within ten to fifteen years (1921 to 1930 or 1935), the total generating capacity of power stations nationwide should be increased by 1.75 million kilowatts, and the national electricity production should be increased by 4.5 times that of 1913 and nearly 18 times that of 1920, reaching 8.8 billion kilowatt-hours.

    The Soviet people have realized Lenin's grand plan with their heroic labor. By 1935, they had increased Soviet electricity production to approximately 26.3 billion kilowatt-hours, more than twice the original plan; making the generating capacity of power stations nationwide almost six times higher, instead of the original 50%. Relying on such high speed, by 1940, the Soviet Union's electricity production had further increased to 48.3 billion kilowatt-hours. And this year, it will reach 291 billion kilowatt-hours. Due to the large-scale construction and reconstruction of power stations, the Soviet Union's generating capacity will increase by approximately 6 million kilowatts this year alone. The generating capacity of the newly built, world's largest Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station (more than 2.41 million kilowatts) alone is 660,000 kilowatts more than the total increase in generating capacity originally planned by the "All-Russian Electrification Plan."

    According to the Soviet Union's new electrification long-term plan, the scale of power station construction in the Soviet Union in the future will be much larger than it is now. According to Soviet press reports, by 1965, the generating capacity added by the Soviet Union in one year will reach approximately 15 million kilowatts, which is more than twice the current figure. And during the period of 1966-1972, the annual increase in generating capacity will be one time higher than the above indicator. In this way, in the recent fifteen to twenty years, the total generating capacity of Soviet power stations will increase by approximately six to seven times, making the electricity production reach 2.3 trillion kilowatt-hours in 1980.

    沿着列宁的电气化计划不断前进
    苏联电力产量四十年来增长五百多倍
    电站建设的规模和电气化铁路的长度等居世界第一位
    列宁论电气化语录
    共产主义是苏维埃政权加全国电气化，因为不实行电气化，要振兴工业是不可能的。
    （列宁全集第三十一卷第三百八十页）
    只有当国家实现了电气化，为工业、农业和运输业打下了现代大工业的技术基础的时候，我们才能彻底取得胜利。
  （列宁全集第三十一卷第四百六十九页）
    新华社莫斯科21日电　12月21日是1920年全俄苏维埃第八次代表大会通过“全俄国电气化计划”的四十周年。四十年来，苏联在发展电力工业和实现全国电气化方面，取得了辉煌的成就。
    现在，苏联的电力产量已经增加为1921年开始实现“全俄国电气化计划”时的五百八十倍以上，即相当于这个计划规定在十至十五年内应达到的发电量的三十三倍以上。在全国发电站总发电能力的增长方面，单今年一年内苏联建成和投入生产的新发电站的发电能力，就比这个计划原定在十至十五年内全国发电站增加的总发电能力高两倍以上。
    目前，苏联工业中的用电量已经增加为大约1928年的五十多倍。在农业中，差不多所有国营农场和三分之二左右的集体农庄已经电气化。全国电气化铁路线的长度已达一万三千七百公里。对实现全国电气化有重大意义的全国统一电力网正在迅速建立起来。现在，苏联在发电站和输电线的建设规模上，在电气化铁路线与输电线的长度上和大型发电机的制造上，已经远远超过一切经济发达的资本主义国家，而居世界第一位。
      “全俄国电气化计划”是在弗·伊·列宁的亲自主持下制定的，这个计划规定要在十至十五年间（1921年至1930年或1935年）使全国发电站的总发电能力增加一百七十五万瓩，使全国电力产量增加为1913年的四点五倍，为1920年的将近十八倍，而达到八十八亿度。
    苏联人民用自己的英勇劳动实现了列宁的宏伟计划。到1935年，他们把苏联电力产量提高到约二百六十三亿度，即超过原定计划两倍以上；使全国发电站的发电能力差不多提高了六倍，而不是原定的50％。依靠这样的高速度，到1940年，苏联的发电量又进一步增加到四百八十三亿度。而在今年，则将达到二千九百一十亿度。由于大规模地新建和改建发电站，今年一年，苏联的发电能力就将增加约六百万瓩。单是最近建成的世界上最大的斯大林格勒水电站的发电能力（二百四十一万多瓩），就比“全俄国电气化计划”原定增加的总发电能力还多六十六万瓩。
    根据苏联新的电气化远景规划，今后苏联电站建设的规模还将比现在大得多。据苏联报刊报道，到1965年，苏联一年之中增加的发电能力将达约一千五百万瓩，即为目前的二倍以上。而在1966年—1972年期间，每年增加的发电能力还将比上述指标高一倍。这样，在最近十五至二十年中，苏联发电站的总发电能力就将增加约六至七倍，使发电量在1980年达到二万三千亿度。（附图片）
