    Japanese Communist Party Summarizes Election Struggle Experience

    According to a report in *Akahata*, the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party convened a national conference of chairmen of prefectural, prefectural, and metropolitan committees in Tokyo on December 7 and 8. JCP Chairman Sanzo Nosaka, General Secretary Kenji Miyamoto, members of the Presidium, secretaries of the Secretariat, and heads of various departments of the Central Committee attended the meeting.

    At the meeting, Harushige Matsushima delivered a report on behalf of the Central Presidium on the election struggle and other issues. The chairmen of twenty-seven prefectural, prefectural, and metropolitan committees also delivered reports at the meeting.

    The meeting unanimously confirmed that while the JCP summarizes the election struggle throughout the party, it must promote the development of various struggles of the Japanese people centered on opposing the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."
