    Guarantee Enthusiasm of Personnel Supporting Agriculture and Build New Socialist Villages
    Wuxi Factories and Enterprises Cooperatively Educate Downward-Bound Workers with Communes and Production Brigades
    (Our newspaper Nanjing, December 18th) Jiangsu Province, Wuxi city's factories, enterprises and urban communes, after transferring a large number of personnel to support the agricultural front, have, in the spirit of taking full responsibility, frequently cooperated with rural communes and production teams to strengthen the ideological and political education of downward-bound workers, giving very good play to the role of these workers.
    Since the beginning of this year, Wuxi city's industrial, transportation, finance and trade units, and township-run enterprises have, through technological innovation, improved labor organization, and consolidated industrial layout, saving over 35,000 people who were transferred to rural areas to strengthen the front line of agricultural production. After arriving in the countryside, most of these workers were highly motivated and performed well. However, with changes from the city to the countryside, in terms of living, working, and labor habits, some people were initially very enthusiastic, but after encountering some specific difficulties, their thinking fluctuated. In order to fully utilize the role of the downward-bound workers, the Municipal Party Committee, on the one hand, required the rural commune Party committees to strengthen the ideological education of the downward-bound personnel and make proper arrangements for their production and living; on the other hand, it instructed urban Party organizations at all levels to actively and regularly cooperate with rural communes and production teams to strengthen the ideological education of the downward-bound workers and help solve some practical problems as much as possible.
    After the downward-bound workers arrived in the countryside, the communes introduced the development situation of the commune and the excellent situation in the rural areas to them through welcoming meetings and symposiums; the cadres of each production team visited the downward-bound workers in their homes, talked with them individually, and specifically understood their thoughts and practical difficulties. Usually, through Party and Youth League organizational life, regular forums, and summary appraisals, the downward-bound personnel were constantly educated. The leaders of various factories, enterprises and related units in the city, such as the Party Committee secretaries or factory directors, also frequently studied and conducted ideological education for the downward-bound workers.
    In the work of cooperating with rural Party organizations to carry out ideological education for downward-bound workers, the relevant urban units generally adopted four methods: (1) Before the workers went to the countryside, they sent cadres to the communes and production teams to introduce the situation of the downward-bound workers to the local Party organizations, so that the local Party organizations could carry out ideological and political education according to the specific ideological conditions of the workers; they also cooperated with the communes and teams to do a good job in arranging the labor and living of the workers and settling their families. (2) When the workers whose families were originally in the city were concentrated in the countryside, each unit sent leading cadres along with them. They stayed in the commune and the production team for two to three months, participating in labor while cooperating with the local Party organization to carry out ideological education and other work for the workers until the problems in the work and life of the downward-bound workers were properly resolved, and their thinking was relatively stable before returning to their original units. (3) For the workers who were from the countryside and returned to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production, each unit also sent cadres to the communes and teams, and to their homes, to introduce the situation to the local Party organizations and to coordinate the arrangements for labor and life. (4) Each unit established regular contact with the downward-bound workers through regular visits, holiday greetings, and frequent correspondence. They continuously encouraged the enthusiasm of the downward-bound workers with the production achievements of the city and factories, as well as the advanced deeds of the workers. In August, Qingfeng Textile Factory transferred 460 workers to Fangqian Commune in Wuxi County, led by Party Committee member Wang Rongpei, and accompanied by eight section chiefs, branch secretaries, and workshop directors. They worked with the downward-bound workers while cooperating with the commune and the production team to carry out ideological and political work. The enthusiasm of the downward-bound workers became higher and higher, and they launched a competition with each other. In the three months of labor from September to November, more than 100 people received commendations and awards from the communes and teams. During the National Day holiday, the alternate secretary of the Municipal Party Committee and vice mayor led 240 leading cadres from the county Party committees, district committees, and factories and enterprises to visit the downward-bound personnel in the rural communes. The visiting group went deep into the small teams, canteens, and fields, and through holding symposiums, individual talks, and other means, carried out situation education for the downward-bound personnel, and learned about their requirements and difficulties, which greatly encouraged the downward-bound personnel. Many factories, enterprises and urban communes also took the initiative to assist rural communes in solving some specific problems in production and life for the downward-bound personnel.
    Under the care and help of the rural communes and the Party organizations of their original units, the enthusiasm of the downward-bound personnel in building new socialist villages continued to rise, their production skills rapidly improved, and they became a vital force in the countryside. The more than 200 workers who were sent to Anzhen Commune did nearly 8,000 workdays of work during the autumn harvest and autumn planting, which made the autumn harvest and autumn planting of this commune progress rapidly. Among the workers sent to Nianqiao Commune, one became a commune cadre, five served as deputy secretaries of the Party branches or deputy captains of the production teams, 25 served as grain keepers, and two served as canteen accountants. They played a good role in strengthening the grassroots cadre force and improving the production management of the communes and teams.

    保证支援农业的人员热情饱满建设新农村
    无锡工厂企业协同社队教育下乡职工
    本报南京18日电　江苏省无锡市工厂企业和城市公社在抽调大批人员支援农业战线以后，本着负责到底的精神，经常协同农村公社和生产队加强对下乡职工的思想和政治教育，很好地发挥了下乡职工的作用。
    无锡市工业、交通、财贸等单位和城镇社办企业，今年以来通过革新技术、改善劳动组织、整顿工业布局等，先后节约出三万五千多人，调到农村充实了农业生产第一线。这批职工下乡以后，大部分积极性很高，表现很好。但是从城市到农村，在生活、工作和劳动习惯等方面都有许多变化，有一部分人刚下乡时热情很高，遇到一些具体困难以后，思想上有些波动。为了充分发挥下乡职工的作用，市委一面要求农村公社党委加强对下乡人员的思想教育，妥善安排他们的生产和生活，一面指示城市各级党组织积极主动经常地协同农村公社、生产队加强对下乡职工的思想教育，并且尽可能帮助解决一些实际问题。
    下乡职工到农村以后，各公社都通过开欢迎会和座谈会，向他们介绍了本社的发展情况和农村的大好形势；各生产队的干部分别到下乡职工家中访问，同他们个别谈心，具体了解了他们的思想情况和实际困难。平时，通过党、团组织生活、定期开座谈会、总结评比等方法，经常向下乡人员进行教育。城市各工厂企业和有关单位也由党委书记或厂长等领导，经常研究和进行下乡职工的思想教育工作。
    城市各有关单位在协同农村党组织对下乡职工进行思想教育的工作中，一般采取了四种方法：（一）在职工下乡以前，派干部到下放的公社和生产队，向当地党组织介绍下乡职工的情况，以便当地党组织根据下乡职工的具体思想状况进行思想政治教育；他们还协同社、队做好下乡职工的劳动、生活安排和安置家属等工作。（二）原来家在城市的职工集中下乡时，各单位都派领导干部随同下乡。他们以二至三个月的时间驻社驻队，一边参加劳动，一边协同当地党组织对职工进行思想教育等工作，直到下乡职工工作和生活方面的问题都得到妥善解决，思想也比较稳定以后方回原单位。（三）对于家在农村回乡参加农业生产的职工，各单位也派干部送到社、队，送到家中，向当地党组织介绍情况，协同安排劳动和生活。（四）各单位通过定期访问、节日慰问、经常通信等方式，同下乡职工建立经常的联系。用城市和工厂的生产成就以及下乡职工的先进事迹等，不断鼓舞下乡职工的积极性。庆丰纺织厂8月间抽调了四百六十名职工到无锡县坊前公社，由党委委员王荣培带队，派了八名科长、支部书记、车间主任等领导干部陪同下乡。他们一边和下乡职工同劳动，一边协同公社和生产队开展思想和政治工作。下乡职工情绪越来越高，彼此开展了竞赛。在9月到11月的三个月的劳动中，有一百多人受到了社队的表扬和奖励。在国庆节期间，市委候补书记、副市长率领各县委、区委和工厂企业的领导干部二百四十人，到农村公社慰问了下乡人员。慰问团深入小队、食堂、田头，通过开座谈会、个别谈心等，向下乡人员进行了形势教育，并了解他们的要求和困难，使下乡人员受到很大鼓舞。不少工厂企业和城市公社还主动协助农村公社为下乡人员解决了一些生产、生活方面的具体问题。
    下乡人员在农村公社和原单位党组织的关怀、帮助下，建设社会主义新农村的热情不断高涨，生产技术迅速提高，成了农村的一支生力军。下放在安镇公社的二百多名职工，在秋收秋种期间，做了近八千个劳动日的活，使这个社的秋收秋种进展迅速。下放到埝桥公社的职工，有一人当了公社干部，五人担任生产队党支部副书记或副队长，二十五人当粮食保管员，二人当食堂会计。他们对充实基层干部力量、改进社、队生产管理等起了良好的作用。
