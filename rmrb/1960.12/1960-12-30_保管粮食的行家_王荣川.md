    The Expert in Grain Storage - Wang Rongchuan
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter
    Wang Rongchuan, a grain storage worker and Communist Party member at the Grain and Oil Management Office of Liantang Commune in Qingpu County, Shanghai, has meticulously explored the rules of grain storage work and created a set of scientific grain management methods. Since 1957, the granaries he has managed have consistently been "eight-free granaries" – free of insects, mold, rodents, accidents, discoloration, off-flavors, disease, and impurities. He has been repeatedly recognized as an advanced worker at the county and city levels for seven consecutive years, and last year he also attended the National Conference of Heroes in Industry, Transportation, Capital Construction, and Finance and Trade.
    Wang Rongchuan carefully studies the knowledge of how to manage grain well in his work. He says: "Although grain cannot speak or walk, it is a living thing. Like people, it breathes and has its own personality. To manage it well, you must understand its temperament and take care of it meticulously." According to his experience, in addition to liking cold and disliking heat, fearing humidity and not fearing dryness, grain has two other characteristics: First, it loves cleanliness. If there are too many impurities in the grain, the heat it emits after breathing will not dissipate easily, which will cause it to heat up and deteriorate. Grain also likes to "live" in clean places, and the inside and outside of the warehouses, stack strips, and grass bags must be clean. If there is dust in the warehouse, the impurities in the granary will increase. If the stack strips and grass bags used to hold grain are not thoroughly disinfected, the rice weevils hidden inside will burrow into the grain and breed. If there is garbage or sewage outside the warehouse, it will also attract insects and rodents. Second, grain "dislikes mixed residence." Mixing different varieties or grains with different moisture contents together also easily causes heat.
    Because of his careful study and constant exploration of the rules of good grain management in practice, he finally created a set of working methods for good grain management. In simple terms, this set of methods is: "Three concerns" before grain harvest, "four understandings" during harvest, "one thorough" before storage, "five separations, two not entering the warehouse" during storage, and "three regulars" after storage.
    Wang Rongchuan does not manage grain only after it is stored in the warehouse, but before it is stored, in the fields, when sowing seeds. He said: "Good seeds lead to good seedlings, and good seedlings lead to good rice. To prevent grain from insects and diseases, we must have good seeds, so that we can fundamentally prevent insect pests. It is passive to treat them after they are stored in the warehouse." Therefore, before spring plowing, he cooperates with the commune's technology extension station to help production teams select and soak seeds, trying to prevent seeds with insects and diseases from being planted in the fields; during the crop growth period, he also often goes to the production team to help commune members spray pesticides to prevent pests and diseases; during the grain harvest period, he also actively participates in the harvest work. This is the "three concerns." During the grain harvest period, he also goes to the production team to understand which batch of grain grows in high-lying areas, which batch grows in low-lying areas, the early or late harvest time, the weather during threshing, and the production team's work habits. The purpose of these "four understandings" is to grasp the moisture content of the grain. Because grain grown in high-lying areas has low moisture content, while grain grown in low-lying areas has high moisture content; grain harvested with high maturity has low moisture content, while grain harvested with low maturity has high moisture content; grain threshed in sunny weather has low moisture content, while grain threshed in rainy weather has high moisture content; some production teams have the work habit of stacking rice bundles in the field for a few days after harvesting before transporting them back, so the grain moisture content is low; some production teams transport them back immediately after harvesting, so the moisture content is high. After understanding these situations, he can not only arrange the warehouses according to the specific situation, but also earnestly publicize to the production team the hope that the production team will stack grains with different moisture contents separately, dry them thoroughly, and then send them to the warehouse separately in order to protect the grain. At the same time, he also helps the production team steam and disinfect the grain storage tools such as stack strips and foot baskets. In the warehouse, he also cleans and disinfects tools and warehouses. When the commune members send the grain into the warehouse, he implements the "five separations, two not entering the warehouse" system. That is, good grain and inferior grain, different varieties, different moisture contents, grains with insects and without insects, and grains with diseases and without diseases are stacked separately in different warehouses. Grains with excessive moisture or impurities are temporarily not sent into the warehouse. After being stored in the warehouse, he also regularly does cleaning and sanitation work, regularly checks the temperature and humidity of the grain, and regularly ventilates reasonably. In addition, if rodents or birds are found, they will be immediately eliminated without letting them go, while remaining vigilant to prevent accidents.
    Wang Rongchuan's spirit of delving to the bottom in his work is the origin of his ability to create this relatively complete set of working methods. Once, when he was inspecting the warehouse, he found that there was still heat in the grain that had been exposed to the sun in warehouse No. 14. While he was moving these grains out to dry again, he was thinking hard on the drying yard. By the afternoon, he suddenly discovered that half of the rice in the drying yard was still exposed to the sun, while the other half was blocked by the house and could not be exposed to the sun. He had an idea: "Is the reason here?" He immediately tested the grain on both sides. Sure enough, due to the different lengths of sunshine, the moisture content of the rice on one side was high, and the moisture content of the other side was low. He understood that the respiration of rice with different moisture contents is different, and stacking them together will generate heat. From then on, he grasped one of the characteristics of grain: it does not like mixed residence. He found that some of the new grain sent by some production teams also had insects, and he wondered: Why do freshly harvested grains have insects? He went to the production team to visit and finally understood that some production teams did not strictly select seeds, and the rice grains with insects were not picked clean. Therefore, to completely eliminate rice weevils, it is necessary to start from the beginning and fight against rice weevils from the seed selection stage. This is the origin of his "three concerns" working method.
    In order to master the rules of grain storage work, Wang Rongchuan constantly humbly studies book knowledge. However, he does not blindly believe in this book knowledge, but constantly supplements and enriches this knowledge with his own practical experience. He saw in books that in order to prevent grain from heating up, it is necessary to vigorously ventilate in winter to reduce the grain temperature; in summer, it is necessary to strictly close the warehouse to prevent outdoor high temperatures from entering the warehouse. Generally speaking, this is correct. But he also found in practice that when the southeast wind blows in winter, the air is humid; when the northwest wind blows, the air is dry. Humid air flowing into the warehouse will increase the moisture content of the grain, which is not good for the grain. In summer, the temperature during the day is higher than the temperature of the grain, and the air is cool in the second half of the night, and the temperature is sometimes lower than the grain temperature. Therefore, he combined the knowledge in the books with his own practical experience. When the northwest wind blows in winter, he opens the doors and windows of the warehouse, and when the southeast wind blows, he closes the warehouse doors tightly. In summer, he closes the warehouse during the day and opens the warehouse to ventilate and exchange air when it is cool in the second half of the night. Because he adopted reasonable ventilation methods, he effectively prevented the heating of the grain.

    保管粮食的行家——王荣川
    新华社记者
    上海市青浦县练塘公社粮油管理所粮食保管员、共产党员王荣川精心探索粮食保管工作的规律，创造出一套科学的粮食管理办法。从1957年以来，他所管理的粮仓一直是无虫、无霉、无鼠、无事故、无变色、无异味、无病疫、无杂质的“八无粮仓”。他已经连续七年被评为县的和市的先进工作者，去年他还出席了全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面的“群英会”。
    王荣川在工作中细心钻研管好粮食的知识。他说：“别看粮食不会说话，也不会走路，但它是有生命的东西。它和人一样，会呼吸，有自己的性格。要管好它，就要摸透它的脾气，细心地照料它。”根据他的体会，粮食的性格，除了爱冷不爱热、怕湿不怕干外，还有两个特点：第一是爱清洁。如粮食里含的杂质多了，它呼吸后发出的热量不容易散发，就会引起发热变质现象。粮食还喜欢“住”在干净的地方，仓间内外、栈条草包等等都要干净。如果仓间里有灰尘，粮仓里的杂质就会增多。如果装盛粮食的栈条、草包不贯彻消毒，里面藏着的米虫就会钻进粮食里面繁殖起来。如果仓间外面有垃圾、污水，也会生虫招鼠。第二，粮食“不爱杂居”。品种不同的、含水量不同的粮食混放在一起，也容易发热。
    由于他这样细心的钻研，不断地从实践中探索管好粮食的规律，终于创造了一套管好粮食的工作方法。这套方法，简单说来，就是：在粮食收获前“三关心”，收获时“四了解”，入库前“一彻底”，入库时“五分开，两不进仓”，入库后“三经常”。
    王荣川管粮食不是在粮食入库后才管，而是在入库前，在田间，在下种的时候就管。他说：“种好苗好，苗好稻好。要粮食无虫无病，就要有好种子，才能从根本上防治虫病害，等入库后才治就被动了。”因此，春耕前，他就配合公社的技术推广站帮助生产队选种、浸种，尽可能不让有虫有病的种子下到田里；在作物生长期间，他也时常到生产队去帮助社员一起喷洒农药，防治病虫害；在粮食收获期间，他还积极参与收获工作。这就是“三关心”。在粮食收割期间，他又到生产队去了解，那一批粮食是长在高亢地，那一批长在低洼地，收割时间的早迟，脱粒时气候怎样，生产队工作习惯怎样。这“四了解”的目的就是为了掌握粮食的含水情况。因为长在高地的粮食水分低，低地的水分高；收割时成熟度高的水分低，成熟度低的水分高；晴天登场脱粒的水分低，雨天登场的水分高；有的生产队工作习惯是：收割后把稻捆堆在田里晒几天才运回去，粮食水分就低；有的生产队是收割后立即运回，水分就高。他了解这些情况以后，不但能根据具体情况安排好仓间，而且认真向生产队宣传为了爱护粮食，希望生产队把水分不同的粮食分别堆放，晒干扬净，然后分别送进仓库。同时他还帮助生产队把栈条、脚扁等盛粮工具蒸烫消毒。在仓库里，也把工具、仓间进行清洁消毒工作。当社员们把粮食送入仓库时，他又执行“五分开，两不进仓”的制度。就是，把好粮和次粮、品种不同的、含水分不同的、有虫无虫的、有病无病的各种粮食，分别堆入不同的仓间。那些水分过高或杂质过多的粮食，暂时不送进仓。入库以后，他又经常做好清洁卫生工作，经常检查粮食的温度、湿度，经常进行合理通风。此外，如果发现有鼠雀，那就立即歼灭，决不放过，同时提高警惕，防止发生事故。
    王荣川在工作中寻根究底的钻研精神，是他能够创造出这套比较完整的工作方法的由来。有一次，他检查仓间，发现十四号仓间中已经曝晒过的粮食中还有发热现象。他一面把这些粮食再搬出来翻晒，一面在晒场上苦苦思索。一到下午，他忽然发现，晒场上一半稻谷还晒到太阳，另一半因为房子遮住了阳光，晒不到太阳。他脑筋一动：“原因是不是就在这里？”他马上把两边的粮食进行化验。果然，由于阳光照射时间长短不同，一边的稻谷水分高，一边的水分低。他明白了，原来水分高低不同的稻谷呼吸作用不一样，堆放在一起，就会发热。从此，他就摸到了粮食的一个性格：不爱杂居。他发现有些生产队送来的新粮也有虫，他就想：为什么刚打下的粮食就有虫？他到生产队去访问，终于弄明白了，原来有的生产小队选种不严，有虫的稻谷没有拣净。所以要彻底消灭米虫，就要从头抓起，从选种开始就和米虫作斗争。这就是他的“三关心”工作方法的由来。
    王荣川为了掌握保管粮食工作的规律，不断地虚心学习书本知识。但他并不迷信这些书本知识，而是不断地以自己的实践经验补充、丰富这些知识。他从书本上看到：为了防止粮食发热，冬天要大力通风，降低粮食温度；夏季要严格封闭，防止室外高温传进仓间。一般说，这是正确的。但是他又从实践中发现，冬天吹东南风的时候，空气潮湿；刮西北风的时候，空气干燥。潮湿的空气流进仓间，会增加粮食的水分，对粮食不利。夏天，白天的气温高于粮食的温度，下半夜空气凉爽，温度有时低于粮温。于是，他就把书本上的知识和自己的实际经验结合起来。冬天刮西北风的时候，他把仓间的门窗打开，吹东南风的时候，就把仓门紧闭。夏天，白天封闭仓间，下半夜凉爽的时候，就开仓通风换气。由于他采取了合理通风的办法，就有效地防止了粮食的发热现象。
