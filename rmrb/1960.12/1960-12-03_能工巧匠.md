    Skilled Craftsman

    Wang Xin, the director of the Tianjin Experimental Song and Dance Theater, was sent to the Chaihudian Production Team of the Chaihudian Commune in Ningjin County in September of this year. From the day he arrived, he labored alongside the commune members. In his spare time, he also helped the cooks prepare meals and the administrator plan grain consumption. During his work, he noticed that the canteen wasted firewood and labor. Over three hundred people in the entire small team ate in the canteen, and seven cooks were busy all day long, yet the commune members still sometimes couldn't get meals on time. This was because the canteen mostly burned thatch, and the cooks added rice and firewood at the same time, which was both time-consuming and wasteful of firewood. This matter caught his attention. He wondered how he could save firewood and ensure that the commune members could eat on time.

    One day, he went to the commune to discuss the matter with Secretary Zhang of the Party Committee. On the desk, he immediately saw the experience of Ping Shan County's successful creation of a "suction stove" published in the October 10th edition of the Hebei Daily. He read this experience twice in one breath. He felt that this method was good and worth trying. Secretary Zhang also asked him to personally create a model to be promoted throughout the commune. He returned to the team and spent half the night drawing up designs. The next day, he began production. Some cooks said, "Old Wang, don't bother, how can you cook rice with just air!" Wang Xin said, "Yes, Ping Shan County can do it, and we can do it too!" He set up the stove and tested it, making corrections where it was unsuitable. The "suction stove" was successfully manufactured. It reduced the daily use of thatch in the canteen from seven hundred to four hundred catties, saved two laborers, and ensured that the commune members could eat on-time meals. (Sheng Fulin)

    能工巧匠
    天津市实验歌舞剧院院长王莘，今年9月间下放到宁津县柴胡店公社柴胡店生产队。从到队的那天起，他就和社员一起劳动。有空时还帮助炊事员做饭做菜，帮助管理员计划吃粮。在工作中，他发现食堂烧柴、劳力都有浪费现象。全小队三百多口人吃饭，七个炊事员整天忙忙碌碌，可是社员还有时吃不上应时饭。原因是食堂多是烧茅柴，炊事员一边下米一边添柴，既花费时间，又浪费了烧柴。这件事引起了他的注意，他想，怎样才能既节约烧柴又保证社员吃到应时饭呢？
    一天，他到公社找党委张书记一起商量。在桌子上，他一眼看到10月10日的河北日报刊登的平山县创造成功“吸风灶”的经验，他一口气把这条经验读了两遍。他觉得这办法好，可以试试。张书记也让他亲自下手搞出个样板来，在全公社推广。他回到队里，当天就画图设计，一直干了半宿。第二天就开始制作。有的炊事员说：“老王，别费心啦，光用气哪能做熟饭！”王莘说：“能，平山县能作到，咱们也能作到！”他盘好灶就试验，哪不合适就改正，“吸风灶”制造成功了。使食堂每天用茅柴七百斤减到四百斤，还节省出两名劳动力，社员顿顿能吃上应时饭。（盛福林）
