    Strive for Overproduction Next Year, Start with Winter Manure Collection
    Jicun Management Area's "Three Guarantees and One Reward" Plan Implementation Spurs Manure Collection Campaign
    Every Team Builds Manure Yards, Every Household Repairs Toilets, 20 Days of Manure Collection Already Completes 27.5% of Annual Plan
    (Our dispatch) After the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" plan for 1961 was implemented in the production teams of the Jicun Management Area (basic accounting unit) of the Xingfu Commune in Fenyang County, Shanxi, a winter manure collection campaign was launched to strive for overproduction next year. Their slogans are:
    Everything for a bumper harvest next year!
    Everything for over fulfilling production guarantees next year!
    After the "Three Guarantees" plan was discussed by the commune members, Wang Shilin, a 72-year-old commune member of the Sixth Team, specifically went to the team cadres to suggest that manure collection be prioritized for fulfilling the "Three Guarantees." He said, "One year of farming is two years of preparation; grasping fertilizer is equal to grasping grain." After drawing up a manure collection plan, Ma Yongyi, the captain of the First Team, discovered that there were not enough manure buckets. The next day, as soon as it was light, he went to the supply and marketing cooperative to buy them, only to find that the cooperative's manure buckets had been bought out by other teams the night before. Wang Shifan, the work group leader of the Seventh Team, took out 1.4 yuan from his pre-issued wages to buy a manure fork, and used his early morning and evening rest time to collect manure. In less than half a month, he had collected more than 6,000 jin of human and animal manure. Old man Jiang Lixiang also went out with a manure basket. He said to the production team leader: "I can't go far, but I'll guarantee the manure collection task for this street. Don't think I'm old, I guarantee to complete the task!"
    Just as the masses' enthusiasm for manure collection was so high, the management area party general branch further strengthened its leadership and actively implemented various policies for manure collection. On the one hand, they uniformly planned manure collection areas for each team and let the tool reform group manufacture one hundred茅桶 (crude latrine buckets), solving the tool problem. On the other hand, they formulated specific measures for rewarding manure collection and fertilizer production based on the "Four Combinations." The "Four Combinations" are: 1. Combining collective manure collection with individual manure collection. Collective manure collection is uniformly organized and led by the production team, which uniformly sets targets and uniformly evaluates work points, implementing bonuses for exceeding quotas. Individual manure collection by commune members is carried out independently during time outside of collective production. The manure collected by individual commune members can be sold to the production team at a price based on quality, according to democratically formulated purchase prices; a portion can be retained by the commune members for use on their private plots. 2. Combining regular manure collection with intensive manure collection. Regular manure collection is managed by a professional team responsible for transporting human manure, repairing public manure pits, and manufacturing various fertilizers; intensive manure collection is uniformly organized by the production team, mobilizing all commune members to complete tasks such as composting, smoking fertilizer, and pressing green manure. 3. Combining manure collection within the village with manure collection in the fields. Within the village, the focus is on human manure, animal manure, miscellaneous manure, and daily composting inside and outside the home; in the fields, the focus is on composting, smoking fertilizer, and green manure. 4. Combining self-collection of manure with purchasing from outside. Jicun is where the commune is located, and is also a commercial market town with many institutions and enterprises. In order to fully utilize the fertilizer of institutions and enterprises, in addition to emphasizing the management area's own manure collection, they specially formulated a system for purchasing fertilizer to encourage institutions and enterprises to also participate in regular manure collection and fertilizer production campaigns. In addition to formulating detailed plans for manure collection and fertilizer production, the Jicun Management Area also issued fertilizer purchase funds to each production team. Work points are recorded daily for collective manure collection; individual manure collection is paid in cash according to quality.
    While focusing on manure collection, the Jicun Management Area Party General Branch also transferred cadres to vigorously strengthen leadership over the lives of the masses. They conducted visits and inspections team by team and household by household.
    Branch committee members were assigned to manage the canteens, with grain weighed, stored, and managed in a unified manner, planned uniformly, and arranged daily. Cadres went down to the kitchens, and commune member representatives took turns on duty, improving cooking and food preparation methods to ensure that commune members were able to eat their fill at every meal.
    Among the 4,177 people in the entire area, 96 pieces of cotton clothing were lacking. The management area immediately organized nine sewing machines and more than 30 women to rush to process and help solve the problem. Since some households lacked door curtains, the party general branch organized forces to weave straw curtains to supply them.
    The management area also organized 20 carts to transport coal for commune members to get through the winter. Now, each commune member household has been supplied with an average of more than 250 jin of heating coal and 500 jin of kindling. These carts are still continuing to haul coal.
    The Jicun Party General Branch's further implementation of policies and strong focus on the lives of the masses has greatly promoted the winter production campaign centered on manure collection throughout the area. Teams are building manure cellars, manure pits, and manure yards, and households are repairing toilets and composting pits. In less than 20 days, the entire management area has accumulated more than 77,100 dan of various high-quality fertilizers, accounting for 27.5% of next year's fertilizer application plan. They plan to accumulate another 147,000 dan before the Spring Festival, bringing the total amount of manure collected to 80% of next year's fertilizer application plan, ensuring an average of 40 dan of fertilizer is applied per mu of farmland. In addition to this, before the snowfall, they concentrated their efforts and deep-plowed 5,459 mu of land, accounting for 90.2% of the area that should be plowed; and irrigated more than 400 mu of winter wheat, accounting for more than 25% of the wheat field area. After the snowfall, in addition to continuing manure collection, they modified 32 simple double-wheeled plows, 12 dense planting drills, and repaired three carts. Commune members individually added more than 400 pieces of small farm tools such as iron hoes and shovels. At the same time, sideline production is also being carried out enthusiastically. The management area plans: that sideline production income from October this year to February next year will be 42,000 yuan. As of November, more than 9,000 yuan had already been completed.

    争取明年超产　先抓冬季积肥
    冀村管理区明年“三包一奖”方案落实掀起积肥运动
    队队建粪场，户户修厕所，二十天积肥已完成年计划的27.5％
    本报讯　山西汾阳县幸福公社冀村管理区（基本核算单位）在1961年“三包一奖”方案逐项落实到生产队以后，开展了冬季积肥运动，力争明年超包产。他们提出的口号是：
    一切为了明年大丰收！
    一切为了明年超包产！
    “三包”方案经过社员讨论后，六队七十二岁的社员王士林，专门去找队干部，建议“三包”兑现先抓肥。他说：“一年庄稼二年闹，抓住肥料就等于抓住粮食”。一队队长马永义在制订了积肥计划以后，发现粪桶不够用，第二天天刚明就到供销总店购买，谁知供销总店的粪桶，在前一天夜里已被其他队买光。七队作业组长王世藩领到预发的工资，便拿出一元四角买了一个粪杈，利用早晚休息时间拾粪，不到半个月，已拾下人畜粪六千多斤。降礼祥老汉也提着粪筐出了门。他向生产队长说：“远处我去不了，我们这条街的拾粪任务包给我吧。不要看我人老，我保证完成任务！”
    就在群众积肥积极性这样高涨的时候，管理区党总支进一步加强了领导，并积极执行积肥的各项政策。他们一方面统一给各队规划了积肥区域，并让工具改革组制造了一百副茅桶，解决了工具问题，另一方面，即制订了“四结合”奖励积肥造肥的具体办法。“四结合”是：一、集体积肥与个人积肥结合。集体积肥，由生产队统一组织，统一领导，统一制订指标，统一评工记分，实行超额奖励。社员个人积肥，利用集体生产以外的时间，单独进行。社员个人积下的肥料，一部分以质论价，按民主制订的收购价格，卖给生产队；一部分可以归社员自留地使用。二、常年积肥与突击积肥结合。常年积肥，由专业队专管人粪运送、公共粪坑整修和各种肥料的制造；突击积肥，由生产队统一组织，动员全体社员完成沤肥、熏肥、压绿肥等任务。三、村内积肥与田间积肥结合。村内主要抓人粪、畜粪、杂肥和家里院外的日常沤肥；田间主要抓沤肥、熏肥和绿肥。四、自己积肥与向外购买结合。冀村是公社所在地，又是商业集镇，机关企业多。为了充分利用机关企业的肥料，他们除强调管理区自己积肥外，特别制订了购买肥料的制度，以鼓励机关企业也参加经常的积肥造肥运动。冀村管理区除制订了详细的积肥造肥计划外，还给各生产队发了收购肥料款。集体积肥日日记工；个人积肥，按质论价，发给现款。
    冀村管理区党总支，在抓积肥的同时，抽调干部，大力加强了对群众生活的领导。他们逐队逐户，进行了访问检查。
    支委分工包食堂，粮食过秤落实，入库保管，统一计划，逐日安排。干部下伙房，社员代表轮流值日，改进做饭、做菜方法，保证社员顿顿吃饱吃好。
    全区四千一百七十七口人中，缺棉衣九十六件，管理区立即组织九架缝纫机和三十多个妇女突击加工，帮助解决。有些人家缺乏门帘，党总支组织力量编织草帘供应。
    管理区还组织了二十辆大车给社员运炭过冬，现在平均每户社员已供应烤火炭二百五十多斤，引火柴五百斤。这批大车还在继续拉炭。
    冀村党总支进一步贯彻执行政策和大抓群众生活的结果，大大促进了全区以积肥为中心的冬季生产运动。队队兴建粪窖、粪坑、粪场，户户整修厕所、沤肥坑。不到二十天，全管理区已经积下各种优质肥料七万七千一百多担，占到明年施肥计划的27.5％。他们计划春节前再积十四万七千担，使积肥总数达到明年施肥计划的80％，保证平均每亩农田施肥四十担。除此以外，降雪前他们集中力量已深翻地五千四百五十九亩，占到应翻地面积的90.2％；浇灌冬小麦四百多亩，占麦田面积的25％以上。降雪后，除继续积肥外，改制简易双轮犁三十二部，密植耧十二架，修理大车三辆。社员个人添置铁镢、锹等小农具四百多件。与此同时，副业生产也热烈开展起来。管理区计划：今年10月到明年2月副业生产收入为四万二千元。至11月份，已经完成九千多元。
