    Today, this newspaper publishes news from the CCP Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company Committee on strengthening the work of Party groups, and an investigation report on the work of Party groups in the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company. These two materials raise a very important issue in the basic work of enterprises: relying on the core role of Party groups in production teams is the only way to fully mobilize the strength of the entire production team and ensure the sustained rise of enterprise production.
    After workers participated in management, production teams in enterprises have played an extremely important role, and leaders at all levels in enterprises are paying more and more attention to grasping teams. However, grasping teams is only for the leaders at all levels of the enterprise. While the leadership's continuous attention to teams has created extremely favorable conditions for doing a good job in team work and enabling teams to shoulder the responsibilities of both basic production organizations and basic administrative management organizations, the leadership's attention to teams cannot and should not replace the work of the teams themselves. To make teams powerful basic organizations for enterprise production and administration, in addition to requiring leaders at all levels of the enterprise to grasp teams, it also requires each team to fully exert its initiative and creativity in production and management. When grasping teams, all enterprise leaders and leading cadres can only be said to have grasped teams well if they further develop the initiative and creativity of the production teams.
    The experience of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company proves that the most fundamental way to fully unleash the initiative and creativity of production teams and enable them to better shoulder the responsibilities of basic organizations is to give play to the core role of Party groups in uniting all members of the team to improve production under the leadership of the Party branch. A production team can have dozens, even hundreds, of people, but usually has more than a dozen. They form a fighting unit that needs to work together to complete one production task after another. This inevitably requires a core to unite the strength of the entire team. This core can only be the Party group. Only when all members of the team are united around the Party group, with division of labor and coordinated action, can the production of the entire team be improved. The administrative leaders of the production team can only do a good job of administrative leadership by being good at relying on the Party group. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the Party group is like a fighting detachment of the branch. The Party branch is the basic organization of the Party, and the basic link for the Party to connect with the broad masses, implement the Party's policies among the masses, and concentrate the experience and opinions of the masses. However, the Party branch cannot rely solely on a few members of the branch committee to do work, but should organize every Party group and every Party member to do the Party's work. Strengthening the work of Party groups so that they truly become outstanding fighting detachments under the leadership of the Party branch is the only way to give full play to the role of the Party branch as a fighting fortress.
    How should the Party group work? In this regard, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company also provides us with some good experiences. The most important of these is to strengthen the close ties between the Party and the masses. All Party groups in this iron and steel company have conducted specific research on the ideological and family situations of each employee in their unit and designated Party members to contact them separately. The Party group can promptly understand and help solve any problems the masses have in production, ideology, or family life. The masses are also willing to take the initiative to consult with the Party group when they have problems in ideology, production, or life. The banner of an advanced Party group in this iron and steel company—the "Steel Assault Team" Party group of concrete workers—has relied on its water-and-milk relationship with the masses to unite all team members and overfulfill the state plan every month for the past three years.
    The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have always required Party organizations at all levels to regard contact with the masses as their lifeblood. Whether they maintain the closest ties with the broad masses and whether they can unite the broad masses around the Party organization has become a basic symbol of the strength of the Party organization's fighting power. More than 20 years ago, when the revolutionary forces were still at a disadvantage, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "What is the real wall of iron and steel? It is the masses, the millions upon millions of people who sincerely support the revolution. This is the real wall of iron and steel, which no force can break, completely unbreakable." This brilliant thesis of Comrade Mao Zedong has been fully proven by historical facts. In the revolutionary war, our Party relied on this close connection with the masses to become stronger and stronger and finally seize national power. In socialist construction, our Party has also relied on this close connection with the masses to unite the broad masses and win the continuous leap forward of the national economy. Party organizations at all levels must deeply remember this fundamental experience of our country's revolution and construction. The Party's grassroots organizations—the Party branches—as the basic link for the Party to connect with the masses, should pay particular attention to maintaining close contact with the masses at all times. Party groups live with the masses day and night, standing together on the front line of production and combat, and should more consciously strengthen their connection with the masses and give play to the fighting power of the Party group.
    The Party group should care about the masses comprehensively and infinitely. Our working masses are masses with a high degree of proletarian consciousness under the long-term education of the Party. For them, the development of the socialist construction cause is the most ardent wish in life, and solving the key problems in production is what they care about most. Only by firmly grasping the link of production, helping the masses overcome difficulties in production, solving key problems in production, and realizing the continuous leap forward in production can the Party group unite the masses closely around itself and lead the masses forward. The experience of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company proves that in this aspect of work, the Party group should first pay attention to discovering new things and supporting new things. The masses have always been the masters of production. Among them, there are many "Zhuge Liangs" whose initiative and creativity are constantly generating many new things in a budding state. These new things in a budding state urgently require the support of the Party. The Party group should always pay attention to discovering and supporting the growth of these new things. In the process of supporting new things, the connection between the Party group and the masses can be further strengthened, and the problems that arise in production can be solved more quickly.
    While actively supporting new things, the Party group should, of course, also pay attention to discovering problems in production, discussing them with the masses in a timely manner, finding solutions, and continuously improving production and increasing production.
    The experience of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company also proves that the Party group should not only grasp production but also grasp life. Grasping production with one hand and life with the other is the Party's consistent proposition. In December 1958, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out in its approval of the regulations of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on doing a good job in several tasks related to the current people's lives that these regulations of the Hubei Provincial Committee "grasped an aspect that is easily overlooked in the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and this aspect is also very important. Production and life must be grasped at the same time. It is difficult to do a good job in production without grasping life." Now, Party organizations in industrial and mining enterprises have put grasping life on the important agenda, and many enterprises have a deputy secretary of the Party committee who is specifically in charge of life. The Party group must pay great attention to caring for the lives of the masses and helping the masses solve some specific problems in their lives.
    The Party group grasps both production and life. In helping the masses solve problems in production and life, it strengthens the connection between the Party and the masses, which can unite the masses of the entire production team around itself, give full play to the core role of the Party group in the production team, and make the production team a fighting grassroots organization for the continuous development of enterprise production and the continuous improvement of enterprise management. With such a grassroots organization, everything in the enterprise is easy to handle.
    The experience of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company's Party group work once again proves that the connection between the Party and the masses is the fundamental reason why the Party's cause is invincible. Our socialist construction cause is in a constantly developing victorious situation. All Party organizations and Party members must pay special attention to being humble and prudent, strengthen their connection with the masses, go deep among the masses, go deep into reality, and rely on the masses to solve various problems in production and life. Now, there are only ten days left until the end of the year. In this final stretch, the Party organizations of various industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises must make persistent efforts to further mobilize the strength of the broad masses and strive to complete or overfulfill this year's industrial production plan with steel as the key link ahead of schedule.

    水乳交融
    今天，本报发表了中共北京石景山钢铁公司委员会加强党小组工作的新闻，和关于石景山钢铁公司党小组工作的调查报告。这两份材料提出了企业基层工作中一个很重要的问题：依靠党小组在生产小组中的核心作用，才能把整个生产小组的力量充分调动起来，保证企业生产的持续上升。
    企业中生产小组在工人参加管理后，发挥了极其重要的作用，企业中的各级领导组织愈来愈注意抓小组了。但是，抓小组，这只是对企业的各级领导组织而言的。领导上一直抓到小组，固然为搞好小组工作，使小组既担负起企业生产的基层组织的职责，又担负起行政管理的基层组织的职责，创造了极其有利的条件；但是，领导上抓小组，毕竟不能代替，也不应该代替小组本身的工作。要使小组成为企业生产的和行政管理的强有力的基层组织，除了要求企业的各级领导组织抓小组之外，还要求每一个小组充分发挥生产上和管理上的积极性和创造性。一切企业的领导组织和领导干部在抓小组的时候，也只有更加发挥了生产小组的这种积极性和创造性，才算是把小组抓好了。
    石景山钢铁公司的经验证明，要充分发挥生产小组的积极性和创造性，使生产小组更好地担负起基层组织的职责，最根本的一条，就是要在党支部领导下发挥党小组团结全组群众搞好生产的核心作用。一个生产小组，多则数十人，乃至百余人，少则一般也有十余人。他们结成一个战斗的单位，需要共同努力去完成一项又一项的生产任务。这就必然要有一个核心，去把全组的力量团结起来。这个核心，只能是党的小组。只有全组的成员团结在党小组的周围，分工负责，协同动作，才能把整个小组的生产搞好。生产小组的行政领导，也只有善于依靠党的小组，才能把行政领导工作做好。党的小组在党支部的领导下，好比是支部的一个战斗的小分队。党的支部是党的基层组织，是党联系广大群众，把党的政策贯彻到群众中去，把群众的经验、群众的意见集中起来的基本纽带。但是，党的支部不能只是依靠支部委员会的少数人去做工作，而应该组织每一个党的小组和每一个党员都来做党的工作。加强党小组的工作，使党小组真正成为党支部领导下的出色的战斗小分队，党支部的战斗堡垒作用才能得到充分发挥。
    党小组应该怎样工作呢？在这方面，石景山钢铁公司也为我们提供了一些很好的经验。其中最主要的是，一定要加强党同群众的紧密联系。这个钢铁公司所有的党小组都对本单位每个职工的思想情况和家庭情况做了具体研究，并指定党员分别进行联系。群众生产上有些什么问题、思想上有些什么问题、家庭生活上有些什么问题，党的小组都能及时了解，帮助解决。群众思想上、生产上和生活上有了问题，也愿意主动找党小组商量。这个钢铁公司的一个先进的党小组的旗帜——混凝土工“钢铁突击队”党小组，就是依靠同群众水乳交融的联系，团结全队成员，三年来月月超额完成国家计划的。
    党中央和毛泽东同志从来要求党的各级组织把联系群众看作是自己的生命。是不是同广大群众保持着最密切的联系，能不能把广大群众团结在党组织的周围，成了党的各级组织战斗力量强弱的基本标志。二十多年前，当革命力量还处于劣势的时候，毛泽东同志就曾指出：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。这是真正的铜墙铁壁，是什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。”毛泽东同志这一英明论断，已由历史的事实所充分证明。在革命战争中，我们的党正是依靠这种同群众的紧密联系，愈战愈强，最后夺取了全国政权。在社会主义建设中，我们的党也是依靠了这种同群众的紧密联系，把广大群众团结起来，才赢得了国民经济的持续跃进。党的各级组织都必须深刻地记取我国革命和建设的这一根本经验。党的基层组织——党支部，作为党联系群众的基本纽带，尤其要注意时时刻刻密切同群众的联系。党的小组同群众朝夕相处，一起站在生产战斗的第一线，更应该自觉地加强同群众的联系，发挥党小组的战斗力。
    党小组对群众应当全面地无限地关心。我们的职工群众，是在党的长期教育下有着高度的无产阶级觉悟的群众。对于他们说来，社会主义建设事业的发展，是生活中最热切的愿望；而解决生产中的关键问题，是他们最关心的问题。党的小组只有紧紧地抓住生产这一环，帮助群众克服生产中的困难，解决生产中的关键问题，实现生产的不断跃进，才能把群众紧紧地团结在自己的周围，率领群众前进。石景山钢铁公司的经验证明，在这方面的工作中，党的小组首先要注意发现新生事物、支持新生事物。群众从来就是生产的主人。他们中间有许许多多“诸葛亮”，由于他们的积极性和创造性，不断产生许许多多带有萌芽状态的新生事物，这种萌芽状态的新生事物，迫切要求党的支持。党的小组应该经常注意发现和支持这些新生事物的成长，在支持新生事物的过程中，党小组同群众的联系能够进一步地加强，生产中出现的问题也能够更快地得到解决。
    在积极支持新生事物的同时，党小组当然也要注意发现生产中的问题，及时和群众一起商量，找出解决办法，不断地改进生产，提高生产。
    石景山钢铁公司的经验还证明：党小组不仅应该抓生产，而且应该抓生活。一手抓生产、一手抓生活，这是党的一贯主张。1958年12月，中共中央在中共湖北省委关于做好当前人民生活的几项工作的规定的批语中就曾指出，湖北省委的这个规定“抓住了工业、农业生产大跃进中容易被人忽视的一个方面，而这个方面也是十分重要的。生产和生活两方面，必须同时抓起来。不抓生活，要搞好生产是困难的。”现在，工矿企业的党组织都把抓生活摆到重要的议事日程上来，许多企业都有一个党委副书记分工专管生活。党的小组必须十分注意关心群众生活，帮助群众解决生活上的一些具体问题。
    党的小组既抓生产，又抓生活，在帮助群众解决生产和生活上的问题中，密切了党同群众的联系，就能把整个生产小组的群众团结在自己的周围，充分发挥党小组在生产小组中的核心作用，使生产小组成为企业生产不断发展和企业管理不断完善的一个战斗的基层组织。有了这样的基层组织，企业的一切工作都好办了。
    石景山钢铁公司党小组工作的经验，再一次证明了党同群众的联系是党的事业战无不胜的根本原因。我们的社会主义建设事业正处在不断发展的胜利形势下，一切党的组织和党员都要特别注意谦虚谨慎，更加密切同群众的联系，深入群众、深入实际，依靠群众来解决生产和生活的各种问题。现在，距年底只有十多天的时间了，在这最后一段里程，各个工矿交通企业的党组织要再接再厉，把广大群众的力量进一步调动起来，力争提前和超额完成今年以钢为纲的工业生产计划。
