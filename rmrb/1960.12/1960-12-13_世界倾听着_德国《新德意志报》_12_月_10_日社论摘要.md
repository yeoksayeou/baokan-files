Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 10th: The German Democratic Republic's "Neues Deutschland" published an editorial today entitled "The World is Listening," which stated that the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries said in the Moscow meeting's declaration that "the world communist movement has become the most influential political force of our time, and the most important factor in social progress." This passage expresses the fundamental truth that determines the fate of our time.

Life itself proves this truth every day. Within hours, the full text of this statement spread to the most remote corners of the world, and the public is discussing the statement day after day. No news agency, press office, newspaper, or radio station fails to list this statement as a headline and widely cite it, because it is a top-priority document issued by the most influential political force of our time.

The editorial stated that the Moscow declaration reaffirmed the unbreakable unity of the world communist movement, which has greatly surprised the cold war mongers. How tragically have the dreams of the international imperialist reactionaries of the so-called split in the communist movement been shattered. As a vibrant, vigorously developing, and deeply unfolding democratic movement, the international revolutionary workers' movement has proven that it is stronger and more united than ever before. In this movement, the sacred thought of Marxism-Leninism has displayed its power to change the world.

The editorial stated that the whole world also expressed approval of the glorious program for peace and peaceful coexistence contained in the declaration. The editorial pointed out that the new socialist order established in one-third of the world is the main source of strength in today's struggle to maintain world peace.

No one can evade this question. This is the key to all problems. This has been thoroughly answered in the Moscow declaration.

The editorial stated that it is easy to understand why the cold war mongers in Bonn are panicked by the Moscow declaration and its tremendous impact on the world. Nazi stormtrooper Schroeder clamored for "caution" and demanded the speedy passage of the new Bonn border law. In supporting him, the "Rheinischer Merkur" wrote that the "lenient practices" of West German officials of the Bureau for the Protection of the Constitution in dealing with travelers would be "very inappropriate and untimely". The editorial revealed that the "Telegraf" commented on the issue of peaceful coexistence in the Moscow declaration, saying, "This strategy must be opposed."

The editorial concluded by saying that all of this demonstrates the despicable nature of the organizers of the cold war, anti-communism, and atomic war. Because they cannot and do not want to accept "the challenge of coexistence" - the peaceful competition between the two world systems - since they are inevitably decaying, they are organizing a movement to suppress freedom, peace, and all democratic expressions, a movement that can only be compared to those organized by Hitler and Franco. It seems that they want to prove the following assertion that the whole world already knows and that they can also read from the statement:

"The threat from West German imperialism to the cause of peace and security of the peoples of Europe is increasing. ... The Bonn state has become the main enemy of peaceful coexistence, disarmament, and the easing of tension in Europe."

    世界倾听着
    德国《新德意志报》12月10日社论摘要
    新华社柏林10日电　德意志民主共和国《新德意志报》今天发表题为《世界倾听着》的社论说，各国共产党和工人党代表在莫斯科会议的声明中说：“世界共产主义运动已经成了我们时代影响最大的政治力量，成了社会进步的最重要的因素”，这一段话道出了决定我们时代的命运的基本真理。
    生活本身没有一天不在证明这个真理。在几小时之内，这个声明的全文就传遍世界最遥远的角落，公众日复一日对声明进行讨论。没有一家通讯社、新闻处、报纸或电台不把这项声明列入头条新闻，并且还广泛地加以援引，因为这是我们时代影响最大的政治力量所发表的一项头等重要的文件。
    社论说，莫斯科声明再次证实了世界共产主义运动的牢不可破的团结，这已使冷战贩子大吃一惊。国际帝国主义反动派对所谓的共产主义运动的分裂的梦想破灭得多么惨。作为生气勃勃、轰轰烈烈地发展和深入展开的民主运动，国际革命工人运动已经证明它比以往任何时候都更坚强和团结，在这个运动中，马克思列宁主义的神圣思想显示了它改变世界的威力。
    社论说，全世界还对于声明中包含的争取和平及和平共处的光辉纲领表示赞同。社论指出在三分之一的世界上建立起来的社会主义新秩序，是今天维护世界和平的斗争中的主要力量源泉。
    没有人能够规避这个问题。这是一切问题的关键。这已经在莫斯科声明中获得了彻底的回答。
    社论说，波恩的冷战贩子由于莫斯科声明和它在全世界产生的巨大影响而惊惶失措，这是易于理解的。纳粹突击队员施罗德叫嚷要“小心提防”，并要求迅速通过新的波恩边境法。《来因信使报》在表示支持他时写道，西德保卫宪法局的官员在同旅行者打交道时的“放宽做法”将是“非常不应该的和不合时宜的”。社论揭露《电讯报》在评论莫斯科声明中的和平共处问题时说，“这种策略必须反对”。
    社论最后说，所有这一切都表明了，冷战、反共和原子战争的组织者的卑鄙本性。由于他们不能、并且因为他们不可避免地要衰亡然而却不愿接受“共处的挑战”——两个世界体系之间的和平竞赛，他们正在组织运动来镇压自由、和平和一切民主表现，这种运动只有希特勒和佛朗哥所组织的运动才能与之相比。这好像是他们希望证明全世界已经知道的、他们从声明中也能够读到的下述论断：
    “来自西德帝国主义的对欧洲各国人民的和平和安全事业的威胁正在加剧。……波恩国家已经成为欧洲的和平共处、裁军和缓和紧张局势的主要敌人。”
