Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd, Taipei Dispatch: The Chiang Kai-shek Group's "Control Yuan" recently held a "general review meeting" lasting over a month, examining the Chiang Kai-shek Group's military and political situation over the past year. Following the meeting, on the 10th of this month, the "Review Opinions on General Political Facilities" was published in various newspapers in Taiwan. This document reveals that the Chiang Kai-shek Group is facing numerous difficulties in foreign relations, politics, military affairs, and finance, causing widespread anxiety and demoralization among senior officials of the Chiang Kai-shek Group.

The opinion paper expresses deep concern about the increasingly unsustainable nature of the Chiang Kai-shek Group's long-term illegal occupation of the United Nations seat under U.S. manipulation. It states that in the United Nations General Assembly, the "number of votes supporting the Chiang Kai-shek Group's illegal occupation of China's seat is decreasing, while the number of those opposing and abstaining is increasing. This situation is particularly alarming." It demands that the Chiang Kai-shek Group conduct a "comprehensive and thorough review of the diplomatic situation" and devise ways to intensify its conspiratorial activities in the Middle East, Near East, Africa, and Southeast Asia.

The Chiang Kai-shek Group's "Control Yuan" opinion paper admits that corruption among Chiang Kai-shek Group officials is rampant and the political atmosphere is decadent, leading to "much criticism and denunciation from all sides. If reforms are not urgently sought, the impact will be worrying in every aspect."

In military affairs, the opinion paper admits that the treatment of lower-ranking officers and soldiers in the Chiang army, "although adjusted, is still very difficult." It suggests that the "public funds and supplies of senior generals" should "not be particularly superior, lest they be too disparate from the living conditions of middle and lower-ranking personnel." The opinion paper also states that many Chiang army officers and soldiers' families lack housing, and the problem of unemployment among military dependents is also serious. It says that the Chiang army officers and soldiers originally from the mainland are all over thirty years old, but due to economic conditions and the general aversion of Taiwanese women to the Chiang army, most are unable to marry, resulting in "many disputes and even blood feuds due to marriage being reported in the newspapers in recent years." It demands that the Chiang Kai-shek military "urgently pay attention to prevention."

The Chiang Kai-shek Group's "Control Yuan" opinion paper admits that Taiwan's finances and economy have been very difficult over the past year, further exacerbating the suffering of the Taiwanese people. It reveals that the Chiang Kai-shek Group, due to its intensified exploitation of the Taiwanese people, has seen "increased tax revenue year after year," which has already caused "many complaints among the people." The opinion paper also states that over the past year, Taiwan's "grain prices have soared, causing price fluctuations and affecting people's lives." It mentions the widespread bankruptcy of Taiwan's industry and commerce, such as the Taiwan "China Merchants Steam Navigation Company," which is also on the verge of collapse, currently "heavily in debt, facing a crisis, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious."

The opinion paper offers no effective solutions to these difficulties and problems encountered by the Chiang Kai-shek Group.

    蒋介石集团“监察院”发表文件
    承认蒋介石集团困难重重
    新华社23日讯　台北消息：蒋介石集团“监察院”最近举行了一个多月的“总检讨会”，检查一年来蒋介石集团军政情况。会后，本月10日在台湾各报发表了“对一般政治设施之检讨意见书”。这个文件透露了蒋介石集团在对外关系和政治、军事、财经等方面都困难重重，使蒋介石集团高级官员普遍感到忧虑和颓丧。
    这份意见书对蒋介石集团在美国操纵下长期非法窃据联合国席位的现状，有愈来愈难于维持的趋势，表示忧心忡忡。它说，在联合国大会中，支持蒋介石集团非法窃据中国席位的“票数减少，而反对及弃权者反见增加，此种情势，殊堪警惕”。它要求蒋介石集团“全面彻底检讨外交形势”，并且设法向中近东、非洲和东南亚国家加紧阴谋活动。
    蒋介石集团“监察院”的意见书承认蒋介石集团官员贪污流行和政治风气腐败，以致“各方批评指摘甚多，若不急谋改革，影响所及，在在堪虞”。
    在军事上，这份意见书承认蒋军中下级官兵待遇“虽经调整，生活仍极艰苦”，它建议蒋军“高级将领之公费及供应等项，不宜特别优异，致与中下级人员之生活状况，太相悬殊”。意见书上还说，现在有许多蒋军官兵眷属缺乏住宅，军眷失业问题也很严重。它说，原籍大陆的蒋军官兵年龄都在三十多岁以上，但限于经济条件和台湾妇女普遍厌弃蒋军，因此大部分无法娶妻，以致蒋军“年来因婚姻而发生纠纷，甚或演成血案者，屡见报端”。它要求蒋介石军方“亟宜注意防范”。
    蒋介石集团“监察院”意见书承认一年来台湾的财政经济十分困难，并且使台湾人民生活更加痛苦。它透露蒋介石集团由于加紧向台湾人民抽剥，“赋税收入，年有增加”，已使“民众很多怨言”。意见书还说，一年来台湾“粮价高涨，引起物价波动，影响人民生活”。它提到台湾工商业倒闭成风，如台湾“招商局”轮船公司最近也濒于倒闭边缘，目前“负债过重，危机环生，情势日趋严重”。
    对蒋介石集团遇到的这些困难和问题，意见书提不出任何有效的解决办法。
