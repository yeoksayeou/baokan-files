    Santa Claus and the Debt Collectors
    "May Santa Claus help us escape the slump!" Some American capitalists are pinning their hopes on this year's Christmas. Their plan is: if they can get the millions of Americans to buy more holiday goods during the annual festival, wouldn't that stimulate the market and open up a wealth of resources?
    However, with the purchasing power of the working people being so low, how can they squeeze more oil out of them? American capitalists are quite adept at using their brains to make money. An advertising slogan appeared – "Christmas on Installments."
    How can Christmas be "on installments"? It's simple. Everything needed for the festival, from interior decorations to dinner and gifts, is divided into several grades, which purchasers can buy on installment plans. One method is to pay in advance, with payment due by December 5th, after which the store will supply all the goods. The other method is to pay afterwards, where the customer finds a reliable "guarantor," takes the goods first, and then pays in installments over the next few months or a year. Of course, regardless of the method, the price of the goods is about fifteen percent higher than the market price.
    The idea is certainly good, but unfortunately, things didn't go as planned. The Associated Press reported on the 17th with a sense of disappointment that this year's Christmas shopping activity in the United States "started off slowly" and that "national sales this week were three to seven percent lower than in the same week in 1959." Why is this happening? The reason is clear: even with installments, payments still have to be made eventually. The American people, struggling in poverty, understand that indulging in temporary pleasure for Christmas means adding another burden of debt. Who would want the kind and amiable Santa Claus to become a ferocious debt collector?

    圣诞老人和索债者
    “愿圣诞老人帮助我们来摆脱不景气的局面吧！”美国的一些资本家对今年的圣诞节抱着这样的期望。他们的打算是：让千千万万的美国人在一年一度的节日中每人都多买些节日用品，不是就可以刺激市场，大开财源了吗？
    但是，劳动人民的购买力那末低，怎样才能从他们身上挤出更多的油水呢？美国资本家为了捞钱是颇能开动脑筋的。一个广告性口号出现了——“分期付款的圣诞节”。
    圣诞节怎样能“分期付款”呢？很简单，举凡一切过节所需用品，从室内装饰到晚餐、礼物，分成几个等级，由购买者用分期付款的办法购买。一种是事先付款，十二月五日前必须将款付清，然后商店才供应全部货物。另一种是事后付款，由顾客找到可靠“铺保”，先拿走货物，然后在今后几个月或一年内按期交费。当然，不论那一种办法，货物的价格都要比市价高出百分之十五左右。
    主意当然不错，可惜事与愿违。美联社在十七日的报道中感慨地说，今年美国的圣诞节购买活动“一开始就是慢吞吞的”，“本星期全国的销售量比一九五九年同星期减少了百分之三至百分之七”。为什么会这样呢？事情很明白：即使是分期，终还得付款。正在贫困中挣扎的美国人民懂得，为了过圣诞节一时痛快，就得再添上一身债。有谁愿意让慈祥和蔼的圣诞老人成为穷凶极恶的索债者呢？
