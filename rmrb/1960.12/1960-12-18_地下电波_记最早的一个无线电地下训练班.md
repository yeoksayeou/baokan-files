Underground Radio Waves
	— Remembering the Earliest Underground Wireless Training Class
	Zeng San
	On December 17, 1930, an underground wireless training class run by our Party in the "French Concession" of Shanghai was cracked down by the imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and twenty comrades including Fang Zhongru, Zhang Shenchuan, Chen Tan, and Su Gangda were arrested. This event marks its 30th anniversary on December 17th this year. A few days ago, several comrades who had studied and worked together in the past gathered in the capital, and we talked about everything at that time, which we found very educational; at the same time, recalling the comrades who sacrificed in the Kuomintang prisons, such as Mai Jianping, Chen Baoli, Zhang Qingfu, and Xie Xiaokang, we all expressed our deep condolences and high respect.

	In 1928, in order to strengthen communication and liaison with Party organizations in various regions, the Party Central Committee decided to train wireless technology personnel, and found two university graduate Party members to study machine affairs and reporting affairs respectively. However, these two comrades were not originally studying wireless, and they had to overcome many difficulties starting from scratch. Li Qiang, who was studying machine affairs, established contact with several wireless equipment merchants, and opened a small shop himself. By 1929, he had mastered this technology and developed several assistants, and he was able to manufacture transceivers himself. Zhang Shenchuan, who was studying reporting affairs, first went to a training class run by the Kuomintang as a student, and returned to train his own comrades after graduation. By 1930, the Party Central Committee in Shanghai had established a radio station, which could communicate with Party organizations such as the Southern Bureau, the Yangtze River Bureau, and the Northern Bureau. How excited we were when we first heard the other party's signal on the machine! In the autumn of this year, the Party Central Committee, based on several small groups studying separately, established a larger training class to train wireless work cadres for the then-Soviet areas and the Red Army. This training class lived on Julai Road in the "French Concession," with the signboard of "Welfare Electric Company" hanging outside; this was one of the earliest underground wireless technology training classes of our Party and the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

	At that time, it was not easy to send more Party members to study wireless communication technology, because this was the "cutting-edge" technology at that time, and schools and factories were controlled by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the enemy would not let us get the opportunity to study. However, in order to adapt to the needs of the development of the situation, we must master this technology. When the Party explained the situation and transferred us to study wireless technology, although everyone did not know its depth, as long as they knew that the task was important, they were happy to accept it. After I arrived at the residence, I only knew that there were several comrades studying together, but except for the few comrades who lived with me, I had never met the others. Our teacher was Comrade Zhang Shenchuan; our school building was a pavilion room where the two of us lived. If the later "Welfare Electric Company" can be called a training "class," it would be difficult to call our batch a "class." For example, Comrade Wu Yunfu arrived before me and taught me, and Comrade Wang Zigan was also a teacher of Comrade Wu Yunfu, and later I helped other students. There was no centralized classroom, no class leader, and at that time it was not called a "class."

	What kind of teaching aids and instruments did we use in the study? At that time, the Party's funding was difficult, and it was impossible to buy machines, and even if there were machines, they could not be moved around casually, let alone put on the table publicly, because ordinary people did not have radios at that time, and residents in pavilion rooms could not afford this kind of furniture. Therefore, in the first few months, we only had a hand key, a buzzer, two pencils, and a few note pads, and we practiced hitting the hand key every day, "Di – Di – Da," listening and copying; only three months later did we use a crystal radio to practice receiving radio signals in the air. One teacher went from one family to another, and at most could teach for two hours. It was impossible for students to study collectively. For people like me, who completely did not understand the principles of wireless before, it was very difficult to learn by myself. Only when we were transferred to the radio station to prepare for work could we see the receiver and transmitter and begin to learn machine affairs. At that time, the Party gave us such learning conditions, which was already the greatest effort, and in the current view, wasn't it too simple?

	Due to the secret environment and lack of manpower, work was very difficult. One person had to do everything and prevent attacks by enemy agents. Every small change in the environment aroused our great attention. Once, our radio station's neighbor caught fire, which worried me and Comrade Mao Qihua very much. We moved the machines and furniture out of the alley, and we were afraid of being discovered. If we didn't move them out and let the fire brigade rescue them, the problem would be even greater if the machines were discovered. Although no problems occurred later, we were covered in cold sweat. Once, Comrade Zhang Shenchuan contracted typhoid fever, but he still had to work as usual every night, which made the condition not heal for a long time, and the doctor also became suspicious. The diagnosis was correct, the prescription was also right, and other people's diseases could be cured, so why wasn't your disease getting better? It was really hard to find any words to deceive this doctor. Comrade Zhang was later imprisoned, and his health has not been good. A few days ago, we gathered together and celebrated his 60th birthday.

	Our life was unstable. We relied on the Party's allowance for living, and the Party's source of funds was extremely difficult. When we were studying, each person received eight or ten yuan of "living expenses" per month, and there was very little left except for eating. Sometimes the Party's funding was difficult, and even this amount could not be paid. We had to subscribe to a newspaper, and also shave, bathe, and buy some towels, socks, soap, tooth powder, etc. This allowance was indeed not enough. As for watching movies and plays, we didn't even dare to think about it, not only were the economic conditions not allowed, but also we were afraid of exposing ourselves in theaters and cinemas, and there was a danger of being followed by the enemy.

	We always bought only potatoes, radishes, cabbage, kelp, bean sprouts, and the like in the vegetable market every day. These dishes were not bad for us, but the landlady paid close attention and sometimes asked, "Why are you so frugal?" We were afraid of revealing ourselves, and if we bought one or two cents worth of meat, we would definitely put it on top of the vegetable basket for her to see. On the day of the Dragon Boat Festival, we happened to have no money and no rice, and there was nothing to pawn. We hadn't started cooking at ten o'clock. The landlord came up and said to Comrade Wu Yunfu and me: "Two gentlemen, what good things are you eating today for the festival?" This sentence may have been a general chat among the neighbors, but it made us feel unusually troubled. Lao Wu answered well, "We have a friend inviting us to dinner today, so we didn't make it ourselves." The two of us immediately went out to "attend the banquet" — actually just walked around the nearby International Cemetery (now Jing'an Park) a few times and went home. In the afternoon, Comrade Zhang Shenchuan sent one yuan, and each of us ate two bowls of Yangchun noodles, and the rest was used to buy rice.

	In the autumn of 1930, after the establishment of a larger training class, the conditions for study and work were much better. First of all, there were various machines and parts, and while learning reporting affairs, we also learned machine affairs. The comrades' political and organizational life was also much more active, and everyone was very happy. However, doing so was ultimately not suitable for the underground party. After it was cracked down by the enemy, it had to return to the old path of decentralized learning. Although the enemy was crazy and vicious and gave us such a serious blow, the wireless communication between the Party Central Committee and the Central Soviet Area, the Hubei-Henan-Anhui Soviet Area, and the Hunan-Hubei-Sichuan-Guizhou Soviet Area was finally established in 1931. Later, we ran large-scale training classes in the Red Army, and machine affairs and reporting affairs personnel could be sent out by the Red Army, which was much more convenient; but at this time, the enemy had become more cunning, and the environment for radio station work was even more difficult.

    地下电波
    ——记最早的一个无线电地下训练班
    曾三
    1930年12月17日，我们党在上海“法租界”举办的一个无线电地下训练班，被帝国主义者和国民党反动派破获，方仲如、张沈川、陈坦、苏刚达等二十位同志被捕了。这件事，到今年12月17日正是三十周年。前几天，我们几个曾经在一起学习和工作过的同志在首都聚会，大家谈谈那时的一切，觉得对自己很有教育意义；同时，回想起在国民党监狱里牺牲了的麦建平、陈宝礼、张庆福、谢小康等同志，大家都表示了深切的悼念和崇高的敬意。
    1928年，党中央为了加强与各地党组织的通信联络，决心要培养无线电技术人员，找了两个大学毕业的党员分别学习机务和报务。但是这两个同志原来都不是学无线电的，白手起家，要克服的困难很多。学机务的是李强同志，他同几个无线电器材商人建立了联系，自己又开了一个小商店，到1929年，他掌握了这门技术并发展了几名助手，自己就能制造收发报机了。学报务的是张沈川同志，他先到国民党办的一个训练班当学生，毕业后回来训练自己的同志。到1930年，在上海的党中央就建立了电台，能够和南方局、长江局、北方局等党组织通报了。当我们第一次在机器上听到对方信号的时候，我们是何等兴奋啊！就在这一年的秋季，党中央又以几个分散学习的小组为基础，成立了一个较大的训练班，为当时的苏区和红军训练无线电工作干部。这个训练班住在“法租界”巨籁达路，对外挂上“福利电器公司”的招牌；这就是我们党和中国人民解放军的一个最早的地下的无线电技术训练班。
    当时要想派较多党员学习无线电通报技术是不容易的，因为这是当时的“尖端”技术，学校和工厂都掌握在国民党反动派手里，敌人是不会让我们得到学习机会的。但是，为了适应形势发展的需要，我们一定要掌握这门技术。当党说明情况，调我们去学习无线电技术的时候，虽然大家还不知道它的深浅，但是只要知道任务重要，无不乐于接受。我到住地后，只知道一块儿学习的有好几个同志，但是除了同住过的几位同志以外，其余的从来没有见过面。我们的教师是张沈川同志一人；我们的校舍就是我们两个人住的一个亭子间。如果说以后的“福利电器公司”还可以称为一个训练“班”的话，我们这一批恐怕就很难叫做“班”了。譬如伍云甫同志比我先到，他还教过我，而王子纲同志又当过伍云甫同志的教员，以后我又帮助过另外的同学。既没有集中的教室，又没有班长，当时也不曾把它叫做“班”。
    在学习中间，我们用的是些什么教具和仪器呢？当时党的经费困难，不可能购买机器，即或是有机器也不能随便搬来搬去，更不好公开摆在桌子上，因为那时候普通人家还没有收音机，亭子间的住户更买不起这种家具。所以我们在最初几个月只有一个手键、一个蜂音机、两枝铅笔和几本拍纸簿，天天练的只是打手键，“地——地——达”，听听抄抄；三个月以后才用上一个矿石收音机，练习收听空中的电报信号。一个教员走了东家到西家，一家顶多能教两小时，同学之间不可能集体研究，像我这样的人，对无线电原理，以前完全不懂，自学起来很是困难。只有当我们被调到电台准备接受工作的时候，才有可能见到收报机和发报机，开始学习机务。在当时党给我们这样的学习条件，已经算是尽了最大的努力，而在目前来看，不是过于简陋了吗？
    由于秘密环境和人手不足，工作是很困难的，一个人什么都要干，还要防止敌人特务的袭击。环境的每一点小变化，都引起我们极大的注意。有一次我们电台的邻居失火，这可把我和毛齐华同志急坏了。我们把机器和家具都搬出弄堂，又怕被人发觉，不搬出去让消防队来抢救，机器被发觉了，问题更大。后来虽没有发生问题，我们却出了一身冷汗。有一次张沈川同志得了伤寒病，但是每天晚上仍要照样工作，使得病情长期不痊愈，医生也怀疑起来了。诊断没有错，处方也是对的，别人的病都能治好，为什么你的病还不好呢？真是不好找什么词来欺骗这位医生呀。张同志后来又坐牢了，他的身体一直不好，前几天我们聚会在一起，还为他的六十大寿祝贺了一番。
    我们的生活是不安定的。我们靠党的津贴生活，而党的经费来源是极其困难的。我们在学习的时候，每人每月发八元或十元的“生活费”，除了吃饭以外就剩下很少了。有时党的经费困难，连这个数目也发不下来。我们要订一份报纸，还要剃头、洗澡，买些手巾、袜子、肥皂、牙粉之类，这点津贴的确是不够用的。至于看电影、看戏，那更是连想也不敢想，不但经济条件不许可，而且在影院、戏院还怕暴露自己，有被敌人跟踪的危险。
    我们每天上菜场，总只买些洋芋、萝卜、白菜、海带、豆芽之类。这些菜对于我们来说并不坏，但是房东太太却十分注意，有时还要问：“你们为啥这样节省呀？”我们怕露马脚，如果买了一、两毛钱的肉，也一定把它放在菜篮子的最上面让她看到。过端阳节的一天，恰巧无钱又无米，当也没有东西可当。到了十点钟我们还未举火。房东上来对我和伍云甫同志说：“两位先生，今天过节，你们吃啥好的？”这句话也许是邻居们一般的闲谈，却使我们听了异常烦恼。老伍回答得好，“今天我们有一位朋友请吃饭，所以自己没有做。”我们两人马上出门“赴宴”——实际上只是到邻近的万国公墓（即今天的静安公园）转了几圈就回家来。午后才由张沈川同志送来一元钱，一人吃了两碗阳春面，其余的就买了米。
    1930年秋季，成立了较大的训练班以后，学习和工作的条件好得多了，首先是有了各种机器和零件，学报务的同时也学机务了。同志们的政治、组织生活也活跃得多了，大家都很高兴。可是这样做，毕竟对于地下党是不适宜的。在它被敌人破获之后，只好仍旧回到分散学习的老路上去。敌人虽然疯狂恶毒，给了我们这样严重的打击，党中央同中央苏区、鄂豫皖苏区和湘鄂西苏区的无线电联络，终于都在1931年建立起来了。以后我们在红军里大办训练班，机务、报务人员都可以由红军派出去，这样就便利得多了；但是这时敌人已更加狡黠，电台工作的环境也就更加艰苦得多。
