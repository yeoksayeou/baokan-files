    Member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee and Chairman of the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet, Brezhnev, also attended the banquet.
    Also attending the banquet were Alternate Member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Belarusian Communist Party, Mazurov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Belarusian Republic, V.I. Kozlov, Chairman of the Belarusian Council of Ministers, Kiselev, Secretaries of the Central Committee of the Belarusian Communist Party, Surganov, Masherov, and Shauro, members of the Bureau of the Central Committee of the Belarusian Communist Party, Pritytsky and Makarov, Deputy Chairman of the Belarusian Council of Ministers, Kamensky, Commander of the Minsk Military District, General Komarov, and representatives from all walks of life in Minsk.

    At the banquet, Mazurov, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Chairman Brezhnev, and V.I. Kozlov delivered speeches respectively.
    At the banquet, Mazurov spoke first. In his speech, he once again warmly welcomed the Chinese Party and Government Delegation. He said that the visit of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation led by Chairman Liu Shaoqi to Belarus is an outstanding event and a vivid manifestation of the friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people.
    Mazurov said that the Belarusian people, like all the working people of the Soviet Union, are delighted with the great achievements made by the great Chinese people in all aspects of socialist construction under the leadership of their Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong.
    He said that we are pleased and happy to see that, as a result of the socialist revolution, China is rapidly transforming from a backward semi-colonial country of the past into a powerful socialist country with modern industry, highly developed agriculture, advanced science and culture. We praise the glorious undertaking and achievements of the great, industrious, and intelligent Chinese people in socialist construction, and we hope that they will make new achievements in socialist construction.
    Mazurov said that the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party and its Central Committee headed by Comrade Khrushchev, are actively and victoriously building a communist society. On the vast land of the Soviet state, inspiring creative labor is surging. On the land of Belarus, the scale of great undertakings and initiatives can also be clearly seen.
    He said that the working people of the Soviet Union are encouraged by the fact that the great Chinese people and the people of socialist countries are advancing hand in hand with them on the road illuminated by Marxism-Leninism. He also said that the unbreakable alliance of socialist countries and the solidarity of the international proletariat are the solid foundation for our victory in the struggle for communism.
    Chairman Liu Shaoqi then delivered a speech. In his speech, he expressed his heartfelt thanks to the Belarusian party and government comrades and the working people of Minsk for their warm welcome and hospitality to the delegation.
    Chairman Liu said that although the time our delegation has stayed here is very short, this visit has left us with a deep impression. What impressed us most is that your people are heroic people. Many of your leading comrades, together with your people, waged extensive guerrilla warfare heroically and tenaciously during the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union, severely hitting the invaders and effectively cooperating with the Soviet army's frontal operations, until finally achieving the great victory over Hitler's fascism. These deeds of your heroic struggle are particularly close to us Chinese people. During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese people mainly adopted the mode of guerrilla warfare to fight the Japanese invaders. In those difficult days, every victory in your guerrilla warfare, like every victory in the Soviet army's frontal operations, was a great encouragement to the Chinese people. We regard your victory as our own victory.
    Chairman Liu Shaoqi then praised the achievements made by the Belarusian people in communist construction. He said that you are heroic and unyielding soldiers in war, and you are skilled laborers in peaceful construction. He congratulated the fraternal Belarusian people and the Soviet people on their new and greater achievements in carrying out communist construction.
    Chairman Liu said that our socialist countries are a close-knit family. China and the Soviet Union are the closest brothers in this big family. The unity of the Chinese and Soviet parties, the two countries, and the two peoples is the cornerstone of the unity of the socialist camp, the cornerstone of the unity of the international communist movement, and also the cornerstone of the great unity of the people of the world. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The unity of the Chinese and Soviet peoples is extremely important. If the people of these two countries are united, the unity of the people of the world will not be difficult." At present, the people of all countries in the world are facing the great tasks of striving for lasting world peace, striving for peaceful coexistence among countries with different social systems, and striving for the victory of national liberation, democratic freedom, and the cause of socialism. Our common enemy—the imperialist group headed by the United States—is vicious and cunning. They want to undermine our unity at all times. But their conspiracy will never succeed. The Sino-Soviet unity built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism cannot be destroyed by any force. The Chinese people will, together with the Soviet people, make every effort to further consolidate and develop our great friendship. In this regard, I believe that our visit will certainly be able to make a contribution.
    Chairman Brezhnev also spoke at the banquet. In his speech, he emphasized the great achievements made by the Belarusian people in economic and cultural construction in the big family of all the nationalities of the Soviet Union.
    Brezhnev said that as we heartily welcome you on the land of Belarus, we express our best friendship and feelings to the hardworking and courageous Chinese people who, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Central Committee of the Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, have completed profound social transformations in China and are selflessly building socialism.
    Brezhnev said that the peoples of the Soviet Union and China have been neighbors since ancient times. However, only after the victory of the socialist revolution in our two countries has Soviet-Chinese friendship developed unprecedentedly, becoming consolidated and unbreakable.
    Brezhnev said that we place a high value on our friendship. It is in line with the wishes of the people of the Soviet Union and China, and strengthens the unity and power of the entire socialist camp, playing a major role in the struggle of the people of all countries against the imperialist schemes of aggression, for world peace and a bright future for mankind.
    V.I. Kozlov, on behalf of the Belarusian people, extended a heartfelt welcome to the Chinese friends at the banquet. He emphasized that the visit of the Party and Government Delegation of the People's Republic of China to the Soviet Union will further strengthen the unbreakable and eternal friendship between the great brotherly peoples of the two countries.
    The banquet was conducted in a warm and friendly atmosphere. At the banquet, the hosts and guests constantly raised their glasses to toast the unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union, and to the good health of the leaders of the CPC Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong and the CPSU Central Committee headed by Comrade Khrushchev.

    新华社明斯克5日电　中国共产党中央委员会副主席、中华人民共和国主席、中国党政代表团团长刘少奇，今天下午六点出席了白俄罗斯共产党中央、白俄罗斯共和国最高苏维埃和部长会议为我国党政代表团举行的宴会。
    随同刘少奇主席参加宴会的有我国党政代表团团员：李井泉、陆定一、杨尚昆、刘宁一、刘晓。
    苏共中央主席团委员、苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席勃列日涅夫也出席了宴会。
    出席宴会的还有苏共中央主席团候补委员、白俄罗斯共产党中央委员会第一书记马祖罗夫，白俄罗斯共和国最高苏维埃主席团主席瓦·伊·科兹洛夫，白俄罗斯部长会议主席基谢廖夫，白俄罗斯共产党中央书记苏尔加诺夫、马谢罗夫、沙乌罗，白俄罗斯共产党中央局委员普里蒂茨基、马卡罗夫，白俄罗斯部长会议副主席卡缅斯基，明斯克军区司令科马罗夫上将和明斯克的各界代表。
    陪同我国党政代表团访问的苏联驻中国大使契尔沃年科，苏共中央副部长托尔库诺夫，苏联外交部部务委员会委员图加林诺夫，礼宾司司长莫洛奇科夫也参加了宴会。
    在宴会上，马祖罗夫、刘少奇主席、勃列日涅夫和瓦·伊·科兹洛夫都分别讲了话。
    在宴会上，马祖罗夫首先讲了话。他在讲话中再一次热烈欢迎中国党政代表团。他说，以刘少奇主席为首的中国党政代表团对白俄罗斯的访问，是一个杰出的事件，是苏联和中国人民之间的友谊的鲜明表现。
    马祖罗夫说，白俄罗斯人民同苏联全体劳动人民一样，为伟大的中国人民在自己的以毛泽东同志为首的共产党领导下，在社会主义建设的各个方面所取得的巨大成就感到高兴。
    他说，我们欣然而愉快地看到，由于社会主义革命，中国正在从过去的落后的半殖民地国家急速地变成为具有现代工业、高度发展的农业、先进的科学和文化的强大的社会主义国家。我们赞颂伟大的、勤劳智慧的中国人民在社会主义建设中所进行的光荣事业和取得的成就，并且希望他们在社会主义建设中取得新的成就。
    马祖罗夫说，苏联人民在共产党及其以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的中央委员会的领导下，正在积极地、胜利地建设共产主义社会。在苏维埃国家的广阔的土地上，正沸腾着激动人心的创造性劳动。在白俄罗斯土地上，也可以明显地看到伟大的事业和创举的规模。
    他说，苏联劳动人民感到鼓舞的是，同他们一起在马克思列宁主义照耀的道路上手挽手地前进的还有伟大的中国人民和社会主义阵营各国人民。他还说，社会主义国家牢不可破的联盟和国际无产阶级团结，是我们在争取共产主义的斗争中取得胜利的牢固基础。
    刘少奇主席接着讲了话。他在讲话中对白俄罗斯党政负责同志和明斯克劳动人民给予代表团的热烈欢迎和盛情接待，表示衷心的感谢。
    刘主席说，我们代表团在这里逗留的时间虽然很短，但是这次访问给我们留下深刻的印象。首先使我们感到敬佩的是，你们的人民是英勇的人民。你们的许多领导同志和你们的人民一起，在伟大的苏联卫国战争期间，英勇顽强地进行了广泛的游击战争，狠狠地打击了侵略者，有力地配合了苏军的正面作战，直到最后取得战胜希特勒法西斯的伟大胜利。你们这种英勇斗争的事迹，对于我们中国人民是特别亲切的。在八年的抗日战争中，中国人民主要地也是采用游击战争的斗争方式，同日本侵略者进行战斗的。在那些困难的日子里，你们在游击战争中的每一个胜利，同苏军正面作战的每一个胜利一样，对于中国人民都是巨大的鼓舞。我们把你们的胜利看成就是我们自己的胜利。
    刘少奇主席接着赞扬了白俄罗斯人民在共产主义建设中取得的成就。他说，你们在战争中是英勇不屈的战士，在和平建设中又是劳动的能手。他祝贺兄弟般的白俄罗斯人民和苏联人民在开展共产主义建设中取得新的更大的成就。
    刘主席说，我们社会主义阵营各国是一个亲密的大家庭。中苏两国是这个大家庭中最亲密的兄弟。中苏两党、两国和两国人民的团结，是社会主义阵营团结的基石，是国际共产主义运动团结的基石，也是全世界人民大团结的基石。毛泽东同志说过：“中苏两国人民的团结极为重要，这两国人民团结一致了，世界人民的团结就不困难了。”目前，世界各国人民面临着争取世界持久和平，争取不同社会制度国家和平共处，争取民族解放、民主自由和社会主义事业胜利的伟大任务。我们的共同敌人——以美国为首的帝国主义集团是凶恶的、狡猾的。他们无时无刻不想破坏我们的团结。但是它们的阴谋永远不会成功。建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的基础上的中苏团结是任何力量也破坏不了的。中国人民将同苏联人民一起，作出一切努力，进一步巩固和发展我们之间的伟大友谊，在这方面，我相信，我们这次访问一定能够作出贡献。
    勃列日涅夫主席也在宴会上讲了话。他在讲话中强调指出了白俄罗斯人民在苏联各族人民的大家庭中在经济和文化建设方面取得了巨大的成就。
    勃列日涅夫说，当我们在白俄罗斯土地上衷心地欢迎你们的时候，我们向在共产党和以毛泽东同志为首的党中央委员会的领导下，在中国完成了深刻的社会改造、忘我地建设着社会主义的勤劳勇敢的中国人民，表示我们最好的友谊和感情。
    勃列日涅夫说，苏中两国人民自古以来就是邻居。但是，只是在社会主义革命在我们两国取得了胜利之后，苏中友谊才得到了空前发展，成为巩固的和牢不可破的。
    勃列日涅夫说，我们对我们的友谊给予崇高的评价。它符合苏中两国人民的愿望，并使整个社会主义阵营的团结和威力加强，在各国人民反对帝国主义侵略阴谋、争取世界和平和人类美好未来的斗争中起着重大的作用。
    瓦·伊·科兹洛夫在宴会上代表白俄罗斯人民衷心地欢迎中国朋友们。他强调指出，中华人民共和国党政代表团对苏联的访问，将更加加强伟大的兄弟般的两国人民间的牢不可破的永恒友谊。
    宴会是在热烈友好的气氛中进行的。在宴会上宾主不断为中苏两国牢不可破的友谊举杯祝贺，并祝贺以毛泽东同志为首的中共中央和以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏共中央的领导人身体健康。
