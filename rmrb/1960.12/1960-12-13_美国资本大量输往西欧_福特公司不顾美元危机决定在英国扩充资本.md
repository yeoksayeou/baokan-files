Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 5th. While the United States is demanding that its Western European allies contribute their gold and dollar foreign exchange reserves to help it resolve its international balance of payments crisis, American monopoly capital is insisting on spending large amounts of dollars to purchase shares in British Ford Motor Company in order to strengthen their economic position in Britain.

It is reported that a spokesman for the American Ford Motor Company recently denied a rumor circulating in Washington that Treasury Secretary Anderson had asked Ford to reconsider the impact on public opinion if his purchase of British shares increased the U.S. international balance of payments deficit and gold outflow. The Ford Motor Company spokesman said that the news was "absolutely untrue."

Ford plans to use $358 million to buy shares in its British subsidiary held by Britons. It is estimated that this amount is far more than the money that Eisenhower announced could be saved in a year by withdrawing the families of American soldiers stationed abroad.

    美国资本大量输往西欧
    福特公司不顾美元危机决定在英国扩充资本
    新华社5日讯　华盛顿消息：在美国要求西欧盟国拿出它们的黄金、美元外汇储备帮助它解救国际支付危机的同时，美国垄断资本却坚持要支出大量美元来购买英国福特汽车公司中的股份以加强它们在英国的经济地位。
    据报道，美国福特汽车公司发言人最近否认了在华盛顿流传的一个消息，这项消息说，美国财政部长安德逊已经要求福特第二考虑对舆论的影响，如果他购买英国人股票的交易增加美国国际收支逆差和黄金外流的话。福特汽车公司发言人说，这项消息是“绝对不确实的”。
    福特公司打算用三亿五千八百万美元来购买它在英国的子公司中英国人持有的股票，据估计，这笔钱远远比艾森豪威尔宣布的撤退在国外的美军家属一年中所能节省的钱为多。
