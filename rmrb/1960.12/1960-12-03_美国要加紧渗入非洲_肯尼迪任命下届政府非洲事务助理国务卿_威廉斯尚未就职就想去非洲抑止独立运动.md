Xinhua News Agency, 2nd December dispatch from Washington: U.S. President-elect Kennedy announced his first appointment on December 1st, appointing Michigan Governor G. Mennen Williams as Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs in the Democratic administration taking office next January.

Kennedy's action illustrates that the new U.S. government will further strengthen its aggression against African countries and its hostility toward the burgeoning national independence movement in Africa. In announcing this appointment, he emphasized that this position is "no less important than any other position in the new administration." He said that as chairman of the African Subcommittee of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he is fully aware of "the importance of this continent (referring to Africa) in the world today." Kennedy was worried about the rising tide of national independence movements sweeping across Africa, saying that "the African continent is a huge testing ground today," and he clamored that the fate of Africa "will affect the vital security of the United States."

In accepting Kennedy's appointment, Williams emphasized that he "considers the most important task in the entire (U.S.) foreign policy" to be "helping Africans find a path toward stable self-government." The essence of this statement is to suppress the development of African national independence movements. Williams also stated that he will expedite the handover of gubernatorial affairs and rush to Africa to carry out activities before Kennedy takes office as president on January 20th next year.

On the same day, Kennedy also appointed Connecticut Governor Abraham Ribicoff as Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. Ribicoff vigorously served Kennedy during the presidential campaign.

    美国要加紧渗入非洲
    肯尼迪任命下届政府非洲事务助理国务卿
    威廉斯尚未就职就想去非洲抑止独立运动
    新华社2日讯　华盛顿消息：美国当选总统肯尼迪1日宣布了他的第一项任命，他任命密执安州州长门南·威廉斯在明年1月上台的民主党政府中担任非洲事务助理国务卿。
    肯尼迪的这一行动说明美国新政府将进一步加强对非洲国家的侵略和敌视在非洲蓬勃发展的民族独立运动。他在宣布这一任命时强调这个职位在重要性上“不亚于新政府中任何一个职务”。他说，作为美国参议院外交委员会非洲小组委员会的主席，他充分认识到“这个大陆（指非洲）今天在世界上的重要性”。对席卷非洲的日益高涨的民族独立运动，肯尼迪忧心忡忡地说什么“非洲大陆今天是一个巨大的试验场”，他叫嚷非洲的命运“将影响到美国的切身安全”。
    威廉斯在接受肯尼迪的任命时强调说，他“认为在整个（美国）外交政策方面最重要的任务”就是要“帮助非洲人寻求走向稳定的自治政府的道路”。这句话的实质含意就是要抑制非洲民族独立运动的发展。威廉斯还表示，他将尽速结束有关州长的事务，在肯尼迪明年1月20日就任总统前就赶往非洲进行活动。
    肯尼迪在同一天还任命了康涅狄格州州长李比科夫为卫生、教育和福利部部长。李比科夫在总统竞选运动中曾大力为肯尼迪效劳。
