Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 29th: With the development of socialist economic construction, Romanian farmers are actively improving their cultural and scientific knowledge, and rural cultural life is becoming increasingly active.

Every winter, Romanian rural areas organize general cultural and agricultural, animal husbandry technology classes. Last winter, more than 25,000 such classes were held across the country, with 760,000 people participating. This year, the number of people participating in such classes is even greater. The number of farmers in Bucharest Oblast participating in the classes has doubled compared to last year. The number of participants in the Banat (formerly Timisoara) Oblast this winter has increased by 26% compared to last winter. This winter, the Romanian Ministry of Agriculture also organized training classes for leaders of collective farms in 58 agricultural schools across the country, teaching knowledge of organizing labor and leading production. More than 6,000 people participated in the study.

Science and Culture Popularization Association and the People's Council organized scientific work teams are warmly welcomed by the masses in rural areas. This year, more than 840,000 people in the Krosz Oblast have participated in more than 6,000 lectures held by scientific work teams.

At present, there are more than 12,000 rural cultural centers and reading rooms, more than 2,000 rural cinemas and more than 100 mobile film projection teams in Romania. In the first half of this year, the number of moviegoers in rural areas increased by one million compared with the same period last year.

Amateur artistic activities in rural areas are also very active. Agricultural laborers account for a large proportion of the more than one million amateur art enthusiasts in the country. Many professional theatrical troupes in the cities also often perform in rural areas and help amateur art enthusiasts improve their performance level.
