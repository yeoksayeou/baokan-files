Xinhua News Agency, Budapest. The Hungarian newspaper *People's Freedom* commented on the anniversary of the Seventh Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party on the 4th, discussing the achievements of the Hungarian people in industry and agriculture over the past year.

The editorial said that the experience of the past year has proven that conditions exist in our country to accelerate socialist construction and accelerate the laying of the foundation for socialism. We will greatly exceed this year's annual plan. Industrial production was originally planned to increase by 7%, but the actual result will be a 13% increase compared to last year, almost double the original target. The three-year plan's target of a 22% increase will reach 40%. Due to unfavorable weather, the total value of agricultural output will be slightly lower than last year's level, but the average total value of agricultural output over the past three years has increased by 13% compared to 1955-1957, while the original plan was to increase by 12%. People's living standards have also continued to increase. Over the past three years, the actual wages of workers and staff have increased by 9.5%, while the original plan only stipulated an increase of 6%.

The editorial said that after the Party Congress put forward clear tasks, the socialist transformation of agriculture has achieved more rapid development than expected.

The Party Congress originally discussed ending the work of laying the foundation for socialism during the Second Five-Year Plan, but before the Second Five-Year Plan has even begun, three-quarters of the cultivated land is under socialist economy. Most cooperatives have achieved success this year, and while cooperativization is developing rapidly, the output of almost all kinds of food is higher than last year. These all prove that the state's support for cooperatives is correct. All possibilities are in place to basically complete the great work of socialist transformation by next spring. This is an event of great political significance in our lives. It will make the most important political foundation of our country—the worker-peasant alliance—unbreakable; it will make our worker-peasant state—the Hungarian People's Republic—invincible. The establishment of socialist production relations will make it possible to start a real high tide of development in the countryside, increase agricultural commodity production, and continue to improve the living standards of farmers and the supply to urban residents.

    匈牙利超额完成今年工业计划
    农业社会主义改造获得迅速发展
    新华社布达佩斯电　匈牙利《人民自由报》4日在评论匈牙利社会主义工人党第七次代表大会一周年的社论中，谈到了一年来匈牙利人民在工农业方面所取得的成就。
    社论说，一年来的经验证明，在我国存在着加速社会主义建设和加快奠定社会主义基础的条件。我们将大大地超额完成今年年度计划。工业原来计划增产7％，执行结果将比去年增产13％，几乎超过原订指标的一倍；三年计划规定增加22％的指标将达到40％。由于气候不好，农业总产值将略低于去年的水平，但是三年来农业总产值平均比1955—1957年增加了13％，而原订计划是增加12％。人民生活水平也继续有了增长，三年来职工实际工资增加了9.5％，而原计划只规定增加6％。
    社论说，在党代表大会提出了明确的任务之后，农业社会主义改造获得了比意料更为迅速的发展。
    党代表大会原来讨论在第二个五年计划期间结束社会主义奠基工作，但是第二个五年计划还没有开始，耕地的四分之三是社会主义经济了，今年大部分合作社都取得了成绩，在快速发展合作化的同时，几乎各种食品产量都比去年多。这些都证明国家支持合作社是正确的。明春基本完成社会主义改造这一伟大工作的一切可能已经具备。这是我们生活中具有重大政治意义的事件。它将使我国最主要的政治基础——工农联盟——成为牢不可破；使我们的工农国家——匈牙利人民共和国——成为不可战胜，社会主义生产关系的建立将有可能在农村中开始真正的发展高潮，增加农业商品生产，继续改善农民生活水平和对城市居民的供应。
