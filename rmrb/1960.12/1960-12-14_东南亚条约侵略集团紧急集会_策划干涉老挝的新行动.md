    Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch from Bangkok: The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) military aggression group, controlled by U.S. imperialism, held an emergency meeting of its Council of Representatives on the 12th, plotting new actions to interfere in Laos.

    It is reported that the meeting discussed the "serious situation" in the Southeast Asian region caused by the "Laos crisis." The statement issued after the meeting once again used the tactic of the thief crying "stop thief," claiming that Laos is facing "external interference," attempting to use this as a pretext for this aggressive group to take new interventionist actions against Laos.

    The meeting was presided over by the U.S. imperialist lackey, SEATO Secretary-General Pote Sarasin. He hastily arrived in Bangkok to convene this three-hour meeting after conducting activities in the Philippines and other places for more than a week. After the meeting, Sarasin said that the council would "of course" "continue to pay close attention" to the situation in Laos.

    At the same time, the propaganda machine of U.S. imperialism—Hugh Baillie, vice president and general manager for Asia of United Press International—also frantically clamored for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization aggression group to "take immediate action" to interfere in Laos under the guise of anti-communism. He said that "Laos is considered to be under the protection of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. If the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization cannot take immediate action, if this strategically located country falls under the influence of the communists, then the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization will prove to be powerless."

    Baillie also did his utmost to instigate the United States to adopt the same means for Laos as it did for the Congo under the flag of the United Nations. He said that "the United Nations seems to be focusing its attention on the Congo, while actually ignoring the increasingly serious situation in Southeast Asia."

### 东南亚条约侵略集团紧急集会  策划干涉老挝的新行动

    东南亚条约侵略集团紧急集会
    策划干涉老挝的新行动
    据新华社13日讯　曼谷消息：美帝国主义控制下的东南亚条约组织军事侵略集团在12日举行了代表理事会的紧急会议，阴谋策划干涉老挝的新行动。
    据报道，这次会议讨论了“老挝危机”在东南亚地区引起的“严重局势”。会议结束以后发表的声明再次使用了贼喊捉贼的伎俩，说什么老挝面临着“外部的干涉”，企图以此作为这个侵略集团对老挝采取新的干涉行动的借口。
    这次会议是由美帝国主义的仆从、东南亚条约组织秘书长沙拉信主持的。他是在菲律宾等地进行了一个多星期的活动以后匆忙赶到曼谷来召集这次历时三小时的会议的。会后，沙拉信说，理事会“当然”要“继续密切注意”老挝局势。
    同时，美帝国主义的宣传机器——合众国际社的副社长兼亚洲总分社社长霍布雷奇特也在反共的幌子下疯狂叫嚣要东南亚条约侵略集团“立即采取行动”干涉老挝。他说什么“老挝被认为是处于东南亚条约组织的保护之下。如果东南亚条约组织不能立即采取行动，如果这个处于战略地位的国家落入共产党的影响之下，那么东南亚条约组织就会证明是没有力量的。”
    霍布雷奇特还竭力鼓动美国在利用联合国旗子干涉刚果的同时，对老挝也采取同样的手段。他说什么“联合国似乎正在把注意力集中在刚果，而实际上无视东南亚的日益严重的局势。”
