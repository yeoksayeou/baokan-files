This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on December 8th: According to the Jiangyin County Party Committee's communication team, the Party branch of the First Production Brigade of Zhouzhuang Commune in Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province, mobilized the masses to work smartly on winter agricultural tasks, improving work efficiency and saving labor. All agricultural tasks were done better than in previous years, and also ensured that commune members had both work and rest.

After entering winter, in order to do a good job in winter production and lay the foundation for striving for a summer harvest yield that exceeds any previous year, the Party branch mobilized the masses to further summarize the smart working experience of last winter's production. From labor management, tool reform, and innovation of operating methods, they worked smartly on winter agricultural tasks.

The brigade first grasped the key link of skillful use of manpower, adapting arrangements and use of labor to the time, place, people, and agricultural tasks. For example, the Ninth Production Team first drew up a list of winter production projects, categorized them into five types such as key, general, and technically demanding agricultural tasks; then drew up a labor force roster, listing strong laborers, semi-laborers, auxiliary laborers, male laborers, female laborers, and the different specialties of each commune member with labor capacity. Through the alignment of agricultural tasks and labor, it was possible to allocate different agricultural tasks according to the different labor abilities and technical specialties of each commune member, generally increasing labor efficiency by about 20%. The short-term production plan of seven days was completed in five days, and all agricultural tasks were carried out in an orderly manner.

Carrying out tool reform to improve work efficiency is an important aspect of implementing smart work. When entering winter production, the brigade adopted the method of mass movement, mobilizing everyone to act as "Zhuge Liang," to come up with ideas and suggestions for reforming agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery production tools. After more than twenty days of effort, the whole team adapted to local conditions and reformed and created eleven types and more than 120 pieces of winter production tools such as manure rakes, ditching plows, mud-digging shovels, processing hoes, wheat-knocking devices, manure-carrying buckets, fertilizer sieves, feeding buckets, and forage-chopping knives. It basically achieved a complete set of new tools for major processes from manure accumulation and transportation to weeding, ditching, and wheat pressing in field management. These new tools are light and flexible, generally increasing work efficiency by more than double, greatly saving labor.

Innovating operating methods is also an important aspect of working smartly on winter activities. For example, in accumulating river mud, they adopted the method of accumulating and transporting directly to the fields in one step, reducing the two processes of loading and unloading fertilizer, and increasing average work efficiency by more than double. In sideline production, they innovated the past manual rope-making method, using a rope-shaking device to make ropes. One person can make sixty to seventy catties of rope a day, increasing work efficiency by more than double. Due to the active innovation of operating methods, commune members worked quickly, well, and relatively easily.

In working smartly on winter agricultural tasks, the brigade paid attention to practical results everywhere, striving to use the least labor and spend the shortest time to achieve the greatest benefits. This year, the entire brigade determined to repair two small irrigation canals and two small embankment dikes in winter, and to dig a small river bay. It only takes a small amount of labor for more than ten days to complete the work, but next year, with these projects, they can eliminate the threat of drought and flood to one hundred and two mu of high-lying fields and one hundred and twenty-eight mu of low-lying fields.

After the First Brigade of Zhouzhuang Commune implemented smart winter agricultural work, a new atmosphere of high work efficiency for everyone and exceeding quotas everywhere emerged. The whole brigade has accumulated more than 58,000 dan of fertilizer, an increase of 20% over the same period last year; more than 400 mu of early-maturing wheat has been universally loosened once, the wheat ditches have been prepared, and "pan-ke" fertilizer has been applied once. The first wheat field processing ended more than a week earlier than last year, and the quality was also better than in previous years. At the same time, winter diversified operations are also better than in previous years, and cash income of 17,000 yuan has been received, an increase of 24% over the same period last year.

This newspaper reported that the Flood Management Area of Zhuangli Commune in Tongchuan City, Shaanxi Province, based on the characteristics of this year's winter production, decided to continue and complete the construction of key water conservancy projects, exploit underground water sources, and strive to use less labor to irrigate more farmland.

The Flood Management Area is located in the upper reaches of the local Shichuan River. Here, two hundred-day droughts occurred one after another last winter and this spring, but due to the development of water conservancy construction and the expansion of the irrigated area, more than 6,000 mu of irrigated wheat and 98 mu of high-yield corn all yielded good harvests. Therefore, the commune members have a deep understanding of the fact that water conservancy is the lifeblood of agricultural production, and that there is grain with water. After the autumn harvest and planting were basically completed, they actively launched preparations for water conservancy construction this winter and next spring.

After everyone's discussion and analysis, the cadres and commune members of each production team and small team believed that the development of water conservancy construction has been very rapid in recent years. There are still some water conservancy projects that are semi-finished products, some have wells but no canals, and some projects have not been fully completed and cannot be put into irrigation immediately. If these projects are completed this winter and next spring, the irrigated area can be expanded by several thousand mu. Based on the opinions of the broad masses, the management area decided that winter water conservancy repair should focus on continuation and completion, continue to advance to underground water, and put forward a comprehensive arrangement of the "consolidation, continuation, modification, completion, use, expansion, skill, and mass" eight-character dragon. "Consolidation" means that in accordance with the high standards of garden-style farmland, the canals and roads of the old irrigated land in the entire management area should be straightened by cutting bends, so that the utilization rate of water can be increased from 50% in the past to 70%. "Continuation" means carrying out continued construction projects. The Qinggangling pumping station, which was planned in the spring, and the several machine wells that are being drilled should be completed as soon as possible, and strive to put them into winter irrigation as early as possible. "Modification" means renovating the four buildings originally built so that they can exert the greatest effect of water conservancy facilities. "Completion" means that four of the seven machine wells completed last winter and this spring should be completed before winter irrigation; eighty general water wells lacking well platforms and waterways should be completed and repaired as soon as possible, and strive to put them all into winter irrigation. "Use" means that all large and small water conservancy projects and facilities should participate in irrigation in winter. "Expansion" means that on the basis of giving full play to the existing machine wells, pumping stations, and canals, four more machine wells will be drilled and one pumping station will be established to expand the irrigated area. "Skill" means that in accordance with the principle of combining work and rest, water conservancy repair advocates smart work and technological innovation. The advanced tools of artificial impact drills are used for drilling wells, blasting is used when encountering stubborn rocks, and a large number of vehicles are promoted. "Mass" means following the mass line, taking the able as teachers, using indigenous methods, and taking thrift in water conservancy as a prerequisite, striving to spend less money, do more things, and benefit quickly.

According to this eight-character dragon plan, the entire management area is divided into three work areas: an organization of machine well professional team, with 24 laborers; an installation and supporting professional team, with 15 laborers; the task of repairing canals and leveling land is flexibly deployed by each small team in conjunction with wheat field management. Now, all localities are actively preparing materials, organizing labor, learning construction technology, and making specific arrangements for work. (Attached picture)

    改革工具巧用兵　实行有劳又有逸
    周庄公社一大队巧干冬活
    庄里公社洪水管理区少用劳力续建配套重点水利工程
    本报南京8日电　据中共江阴县委通讯组报道：江苏省江阴县周庄公社第一生产大队党支部发动群众巧干冬季农活，提高了工效，节省了劳动力，各项农活都比往年干得好，还作到了使社员有劳有逸。
    在进入冬季以后，党支部为了搞好冬季生产，为争取明年夏熟产量超过以往任何一年打下基础，发动群众进一步总结了去年冬季生产的巧干经验，从劳动管理、改革工具、革新操作方法等方面，巧干冬季农活。
    这个大队首先抓住了巧用兵这一环节，因时、因地、因人、因农活制宜安排和使用劳力。例如第九生产小队先排出冬季生产的项目，按项目分类排出重点的、一般的和技术性较强的等五种农活；然后再排劳力队，分别排出强劳力、半劳力、辅助劳力、男劳力、女劳力，以及各个有劳动能力的社员的不同专长。通过农活、劳力排队，做到根据各个社员不同的劳动能力和技术专长，分配不同农活，一般提高了劳动效率20％左右，七天的小段生产计划五天全部完成，并且做到各项农活井井有条。
    开展工具改革，提高工效，是实行巧干的重要环节。这个大队在转入冬季生产时，就采取群众运动的方法，发动人人当“诸葛亮”，想办法，出主意，改革农、林、牧、副、渔各项生产的工具。全队经过二十多天的努力，因地制宜地改制和创制了积肥耙、开沟犁、挖泥锹、加工锄、敲麦器、运肥桶、施肥筛、喂饲桶、铡饲刀等冬季生产工具十一种、一百二十多件，并且从积肥、运肥到锄草、整沟、压麦等田间加工管理主要工序上，基本实现了新工具配套成龙。这些新工具轻巧灵活，一般都提高工效一倍以上，大大节省了劳力。
    革新操作方法，也是巧干冬活的一个重要方面。例如积取河泥，采取了边积、边运一步到田，减少了装肥、卸肥两道工序，平均提高工效一倍以上。在副业生产上，革新了过去用手工绞绳的操作方法，采用摇绳器绞绳，一个人一天可以绞六、七十斤绳子，提高工效一倍多。由于积极革新操作方法，社员们干起活来又快，又好，又比较轻松。
    在巧干冬季农活中，这个大队处处讲究实效，力争用最少的劳动力，花最短的时间，收到最大的效益。今年全大队确定冬季整修的两条小型灌溉渠道、两条小型圩岸，整挖一条小河浜，只需用很少的劳力，干上十多天，就可以完工，但是明年凭借这些工程就可以解除一百零二亩高田和一百二十八亩低田的旱涝威胁。
    周庄公社第一大队实行巧干冬季农活后，到处出现了人人高工效，个个超定额的新气象。全大队已积肥料五万八千多担，比去年同期增加20％；四百多亩早茬麦子已普遍碎土一次，整好麦沟，并追施了一遍“盘棵”肥，第一次麦田加工比去年提早一个多星期结束，质量也比往年好。同时，冬季多种经营也胜过往年，现已收入现金一万七千元，比去年同期增加24％。
    本报讯　陕西省铜川市庄里公社洪水管区，根据今年冬季生产特点，决定重点水利工程建设的续建和配套，挖掘地下水源，力争少用劳力，多灌农田。
    洪水管区位于当地石川河的最上游。这里，去冬今春连遭两个百日大旱，但由于水利建设的发展，灌溉面积的扩大，灌了水的六千多亩小麦和九十八亩高额丰产玉米，都得到很好的收成。因此，社员们对水利是农业增产的命脉，有了水就有粮食的认识很深。在秋收秋种基本结束后，他们就积极展开了今冬明春水利建设的准备工作。
    经过大家讨论分析，各生产队、小队干部、社员都认为，几年来水利建设的发展很快，当地还有一部分水利工程是半成品，有的修了井还没有渠，有的工程还没有配套成龙，不能马上投入灌溉，如果把这些工程赶今冬明春续建完成，就能扩大灌溉面积几千亩。这个管理区根据广大群众的意见，决定冬修水利以续建、配套为主，继续向地下水进军，提出了“整、续、改、配、用、扩、巧、群”八字一条龙的全面安排。“整”，就是按照园田化的高标准要求，把全管区老水地的渠道、道路，截弯取直，这样水的利用率就可以从过去的50％提高到70％。“续”，搞续建工程。把春季筹建的青岗岭抽水站和正在打的几口机井抓紧完成，争取提早投入冬灌。“改”，对原来修建的四座建筑物进行改建，使能发挥水利设施的最大效能。“配”，去冬今春完成的七眼机井中的四眼在冬灌前配套成龙；八十眼缺井台、没有水道的一般水井，尽快配制赶修，争取全部投入冬灌。“用”，就是全部大小水利工程、设施，都在冬季参加灌溉。“扩”，在充分发挥现有机井、抽水站、渠道作用的基础上，再打机井四眼、建立抽水站一处，扩大灌溉面积。“巧”，按照劳逸结合原则，修水利提倡巧干和技术革新。打井采取人工冲击钻的先进工具，遇到顽石用爆破，并且大量推行车子化。“群”，走群众路线，拜能者为师，土法上马，以节俭办水利为前提，争取少花钱，多办事，受益快。
    根据这八字一条龙的规划，全管区划分了三个工区：组织机井专业队一个，劳力二十四人；安装配套专业队一个，劳力十五人；修渠平地的任务，由各小队结合麦田管理灵活调配。现在，各地正在积极备料，组织劳力，学习施工技术和具体安排活路。（附图片）
