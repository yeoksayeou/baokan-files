    Everyone Becomes a "Happy Key"
    A commune member from the Guo Fort Management District, Third Team, of the Huguan Gu Village Commune in Shanxi Province, said that their team's Party Branch Secretary, Yan Yuanze, is good at ideological work, like a "happy key." In fact, their team's "happy key" is not just one, but two, three...
  Yan Yuanze often says: "One team has dozens or hundreds of people, relying solely on one person to do ideological work means even if they talk until their mouth is worn out and run until their legs break, it won't be enough." Therefore, he adopted the method of "sesame rolling in maltose," mobilizing everyone to do ideological work and each person to become a "happy key." Each Party and Youth League member is fixed to contact three to five activists, and each activist is fixed to contact several members of the masses, to listen to the various opinions of the masses, promote the Party's guidelines and policies, and solve the ideological problems of the masses. In August of this year, after the laborers who were transferred out returned to the team, Jiao Jinming, who had previously worked in the commune's repair shop, always felt that farming was not as good as working in a factory, and was not settled on agricultural production. After discovering this, they gathered the laborers who had returned from outside and held a heart-to-heart meeting, helping Jiao Jinming overcome his erroneous thinking, and his production enthusiasm greatly increased. During the autumn harvest, he exceeded his quota every day. The commune members praised him, saying: "If we work like Jinming, we don't have to worry about the land not increasing production."

    人人都做“开心钥匙”
    山西省壶关固村公社郭堡管理区三队的社员，说他们队的党支部书记阎元则，善于做思想工作，好像一把“开心钥匙”。其实，他们队的“开心钥匙”并不是一把，而是两把、三把……。
  阎元则常说：“一个队，几十号成百号人，光靠一个人做思想工作，就是说破嘴、跑断腿也不行。”所以，他采取了“麻糖滚芝麻”的办法，发动人人做思想工作，个个成为“开心钥匙”。每个党、团员固定联系三至五个积极分子，每个积极分子，又固定联系几个群众，听取群众的各种意见，宣传党的方针政策，解决群众的思想问题。今年8月间，这个队的外调劳力回队后，原在公社修配厂工作的焦金明，总觉得务农不如做工好，不安心农业生产。他们发现后，就召集外调回队劳力，开了个谈心会，帮助焦金明克服了错误思想，生产积极性大大提高。在秋收中，他天天超过定额。社员们称赞说：“要像金明这样干，不怕土地不增产。”
