Xinhua News Agency, 8th December: The statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China regarding the kidnapping of Congolese Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba by the U.S. imperialists and their agent, the Mobutu clique.

December 8, 1960

On December 1st, the Mobutu rebel clique, under the direction of U.S. imperialism and with the support of the U.S.-controlled "United Nations Forces" headquarters, brazenly kidnapped Patrice Lumumba, the Prime Minister of the Republic of Congo, subjecting him to insults and torture. The government and people of the People's Republic of China express boundless indignation and the strongest protest against this grave and heinous act by U.S. imperialism and the Mobutu rebel clique acting on U.S. imperialist orders.

Since U.S. imperialism colluded with Belgian imperialism to plot the Mobutu group's rebellion, Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba has been illegally placed under house arrest, while other important government members have been either illegally pursued or illegally imprisoned. In order to realize its aggressive conspiracy to swallow Congo, U.S. imperialism, disregarding the opposition of socialist countries and many Asian and African countries, manipulated the United Nations voting machine on November 22 to illegally deprive the Central Government of the Republic of Congo, headed by Prime Minister Lumumba and Deputy Prime Minister Gizenga, of its legitimate representation in the United Nations. Instigated and supported by U.S. imperialism, the Mobutu rebel clique openly and successively expelled the diplomatic representatives of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Ghana without reason, and announced the severance of diplomatic relations with the United Arab Republic; they also threatened the diplomatic representatives of other Asian and African countries stationed in Congo who had adopted a just stance in support of the legitimate government of Congo. The above-mentioned crimes of U.S. imperialism and its agent, the Mobutu group, are not only a serious provocation against Congo and independent African countries, but also a serious provocation against all peace-loving countries and peoples. The Government of the People's Republic of China most severely condemns and protests the despicable crimes of U.S. imperialism in invading and interfering in Congo and threatening peace in Africa, Asia, and the world. The Chinese government and the Chinese people resolutely demand that the imperialist bloc headed by the United States and the "United Nations Forces" immediately cease their aggression and interference in Congo, immediately cease their persecution of Prime Minister Lumumba, Senate Speaker Okito, and House Speaker Kasongo, and immediately restore their freedom; the criminals who persecuted them must be duly punished; the legitimate status of the Central Government of the Republic of Congo headed by Prime Minister Lumumba must be immediately restored and respected. The Chinese government and the Chinese people resolutely support the heroic struggle of the Congolese people against U.S.-led imperialism and its running dogs. The Chinese government and the Chinese people support the Soviet government's statement on the situation in Congo, and appeal to Asian and African countries and all peace-loving countries and peoples to take immediate action to stop the U.S.-led imperialists from persecuting Prime Minister Lumumba, to stop the U.S.-led imperialists from invading and interfering in Congo, and to support the patriotic and just struggle of the Congolese people to safeguard national independence. The Chinese people firmly believe that as long as the Congolese people unite, the Congolese people's just struggle against U.S.-led imperialism and its agent, the Mobutu rebel clique, and to safeguard national independence, will surely achieve final victory with the support of peace-loving countries and peoples in Asia, Africa, and the world; the U.S.-led imperialists and their running dogs, who have committed countless crimes against the Congolese people, will surely reap the bitter fruit of their own making.

    新华社8日讯  中华人民共和国政府关于美帝国主义及其代理人蒙博托集团绑架刚果共和国总理卢蒙巴的声明。
    1960年12月8日
    12月1日，蒙博托叛乱集团在美帝国主义的指使和美国操纵的“联合国军”司令部的支持下，悍然绑架了刚果共和国巴蒂斯·卢蒙巴总理，对他横加侮辱和折磨。中华人民共和国政府和人民对美帝国主义，以及执行美帝国主义命令的蒙博托叛乱集团的这一严重罪恶行为，表示无限的愤慨和最强烈的抗议。
    自从美帝国主义串通比利时帝国主义策划蒙博托集团发动叛乱以来，刚果共和国政府总理卢蒙巴即被非法软禁，其他重要政府成员或被非法追捕，或遭非法监禁。美帝国主义为实现鲸吞刚果的侵略阴谋，竟然不顾社会主义国家和许多亚非国家的反对，在11月22日，操纵联合国的表决机器非法剥夺了以卢蒙巴总理和基赞加副总理为首的刚果共和国中央政府在联合国的合法代表权。蒙博托叛乱集团在美帝国主义的唆使和支持下，公然先后无理驱逐苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和加纳的外交代表，并且宣布同阿拉伯联合共和国断绝外交关系；对采取支持刚果合法政府正义立场的其他亚非国家驻刚果的外交代表也在多方进行威胁。美帝国主义及其代理人蒙博托集团的上述种种罪行，不仅是对刚果和非洲独立国家的严重挑衅，也是对一切爱好和平的国家和人民的严重挑衅。中华人民共和国政府最严厉地谴责和抗议美帝国主义侵略和干涉刚果，威胁非洲、亚洲和世界和平的卑鄙罪行。中国政府和中国人民坚决要求以美国为首的帝国主义集团和“联合国军”立即停止对刚果的侵略和干涉，立即停止对卢蒙巴总理、参议院议长奥基托和众议院议长卡松戈等人的迫害，立即恢复他们的自由；迫害他们的罪犯，必须受到应有的惩办；以卢蒙巴总理为首的刚果共和国中央政府的合法地位必须立即恢复，并且得到尊重。中国政府和中国人民坚决支持刚果人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗的英勇斗争。中国政府和中国人民支持苏联政府关于刚果局势的声明，并且向亚非国家和一切爱好和平的国家和人民呼吁立即采取行动，制止以美国为首的帝国主义对卢蒙巴总理的迫害，制止以美国为首的帝国主义对刚果的侵略和干涉，并且支持刚果人民维护民族独立的爱国正义斗争。中国人民坚信，只要刚果人民团结起来，刚果人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其代理人蒙博托叛乱集团、维护民族独立的正义斗争，在亚洲、非洲和世界爱好和平的国家和人民的支持下，必将取得最后的胜利；对刚果人民犯下了累累罪行的以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗，必将自食其恶果。
