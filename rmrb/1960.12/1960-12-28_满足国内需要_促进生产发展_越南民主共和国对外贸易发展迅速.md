Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 27th: With the tremendous achievements made in economic construction, North Vietnam's foreign trade has experienced rapid development. Currently, Vietnam has established trade relations with twenty-eight countries. Compared to 1955, this year's export volume has increased elevenfold, and the variety of export commodities has increased from fifty-nine to one hundred and twenty-two. North Vietnam's total export value is now more than double that of South Vietnam.

This was stated by Phan Anh, Minister of Foreign Trade of Vietnam, in a recent interview with a Vietnam News Agency reporter. Phan Anh said that the increase in exports not only largely meets the needs for imported goods for economic and cultural development, but also promotes the rapid development of domestic production. He said that in 1955, imports of consumer goods accounted for 55.3% of the total import volume in North Vietnam, while means of production accounted for 44.7%. By 1960, the proportion of consumer goods in the total import volume had decreased to 10.7%, while means of production had risen to 89.3%. In the past three years, thanks to the good implementation of the correct foreign trade policy, a large amount of machinery and equipment and raw materials have been imported, improving industrial equipment.

Phan Anh said that in recent years, due to the expansion of sales of handicrafts and art crafts abroad, handicraft production has reached an unprecedented level. In 1957, the export value of such products accounted for only 6.8% of the total export value, but by 1960 it had increased to 26.9%. This has not only increased the source of foreign exchange but also solved the employment problem for some people.

When talking about the prospects of foreign trade during the first five-year plan, Phan Anh said that in the next five years, agricultural, forestry, native, and special products will occupy the primary position in export goods, and the export of various minerals and industrial products will also increase.

    满足国内需要　促进生产发展
    越南民主共和国对外贸易发展迅速
    新华社河内27日电　随着经济建设取得巨大成就，越南北方的对外贸易获得了迅速发展。目前越南已同二十八个国家建立了贸易关系。与1955年比较，今年的出口额增加了十一倍，出口商品品种由五十九种增加到一百二十二种。越南北方的出口总值已比南方多一倍。
    这是越南对外贸易部部长潘英最近对越南通讯社记者发表谈话时说的。潘英说，出口的增加，不仅在很大程度上满足了发展经济和文化对于进口货物的需要，而且也促进了国内生产的迅速发展。他说，1955年越南北方消费品的进口占全部进口总额的55.3％，生产资料占44.7％。但到1960年，消费品在进口总额中的比重已下降到10.7％，生产资料则上升到89.3％。在过去三年中，由于良好地执行了正确的对外贸易政策，进口了大量的机器设备和原材料，改善了工业的设备。
    潘英说，几年来，由于手工业品和美术工艺品在国外销路的扩大，手工业生产达到了从来没有过的水平。1957年，这种产品的出口额只占全部出口额的6.8％，而到1960年已增加到26.9％。这不仅增加了外汇的来源，而且解决了一些人的就业问题。
    潘英在谈到第一个五年计划期间的对外贸易前景时说，在今后五年中，农、林、土、特产品将在出口货物中占首要的地位，同时各种矿产和工业产品的出口也将增加。
