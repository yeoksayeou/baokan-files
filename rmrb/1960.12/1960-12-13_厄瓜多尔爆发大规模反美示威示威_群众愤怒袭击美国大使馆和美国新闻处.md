Xinhua News Agency, Quito, December 12th: Mass anti-American demonstrations, initiated by Ecuadorian students on December 9th in the capital city of Quito, are expanding. Large-scale anti-American demonstrations have occurred in several major cities throughout the country.

On December 9th, hundreds of students in Quito demonstrated in front of the U.S. Embassy in Ecuador. Angry demonstrators used bricks and stones to smash the windows of the embassy building.

The next day, students in Quito continued their anti-American demonstrations, attacking the U.S. Embassy and the U.S. Information Service with bricks and stones, while shouting slogans: "Down with U.S. Imperialism!" "Long Live Cuba and Ecuador Against U.S. Exploiters!" "We Want Cuba, Not the Yankees!" The demonstrators also demanded that Ecuador establish relations with socialist countries.

At the same time, students and people in several major cities of Ecuador also held anti-American demonstrations. Demonstrators shouted slogans against U.S. imperialism, in support of the Cuban Revolution, and demanding the establishment of relations with socialist countries. Students in Guayaquil, an important city in Ecuador, demonstrated in front of the U.S. Consulate and smashed the windows of the consulate building.

The Ecuadorian Law School Association announced on December 10th that students in Guayaquil would hold a large-scale anti-U.S. imperialism rally on December 12th.

It is reported that the trigger for these demonstrations was the recent involvement of the United States, as one of the guarantor countries of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol, in making a decision to maintain this protocol. This protocol, signed at a Pan-American Conference in 1942, stipulated the transfer of a piece of Ecuadorian territory to Peru, which had then invaded the country with troops. The border dispute between Ecuador and Peru and the signing of this protocol were both the result of provocation and instigation by the Mobil Oil Company, which occupies oil concessions in the region.

    厄瓜多尔爆发大规模反美示威示威
    群众愤怒袭击美国大使馆和美国新闻处
    新华社12日讯　基多消息：由厄瓜多尔学生9日在首都基多开始的群众反美示威正在扩大。这个国家的一些主要城市里都发生了大规模的反美示威。
    9日，几百名基多的大学生在美国驻厄瓜多尔大使馆门前举行了示威。愤怒的示威者用砖石击碎了大使馆建筑物的窗户。
    第二天，基多学生继续举行反美示威，用砖石攻击了美国大使馆和美国新闻处，并且高呼口号：“打倒美帝国主义！”“反对美国剥削者的古巴和厄瓜多尔万岁！”“要古巴，不要美国佬！”示威者还要求厄瓜多尔同社会主义国家建立关系。
    与此同时，厄瓜多尔一些主要城市中的学生和人民群众也举行了反美示威。示威者高呼反对美帝国主义、支持古巴革命和要求同社会主义国家建立关系的口号。厄瓜多尔的重要城市瓜亚基尔的学生在美国领事馆前举行了示威，并且击碎了领事馆建筑物的窗户。
    厄瓜多尔法律学校协会在10日宣布，瓜亚基尔的学生将在12日举行大规模反对美帝国主义的集会。
    据报道，这次示威的导火线是作为里约热内卢议定书的保证国之一的美国最近参与作出关于维持这项议定书的决定，1942年在一次泛美会议上签订的这项议定书规定把厄瓜多尔的一片领土划归当时派军队侵入这个国家的秘鲁。厄瓜多尔和秘鲁的边界纠纷和这项议定书的签订，都是在这个地区霸占着石油租让地的美孚油公司进行挑拨和策动的结果。
