Xinhua News Agency, 30th – Beijing's transportation departments have adopted a "relay transportation" method in the transfer of agricultural and sideline products and agricultural production materials, enabling close collaboration and interlocking connections between various modes of transport. Over the past month, transportation efficiency has increased by 80%, the time vehicles spend at stations for operations has been reduced by two-thirds, and the turnover speed of goods has doubled, greatly enhancing the potential of vehicles.

Relay transportation uses stations and roadside areas as material distribution centers, closely linking long-distance and short-distance transportation, specialized and mass transportation, and modern and traditional transportation tools, ensuring that each link on the transportation line proceeds rhythmically. Before adopting relay transportation, the Party organizations of the seventeen districts and counties under Beijing's jurisdiction conducted "one chess game" ideological education for the staff of relevant units, making everyone aware of the benefits of organically connecting decentralized, multi-stage transportation through relay transportation, linking them into one continuous flow. They also required all relevant departments, various modes of transportation, and loading and unloading forces to act in a unified manner, interlinking each stage. This created favorable conditions for mobilizing all forces to carry out a mass short-distance transportation campaign.

In relay transportation, production teams in the people's communes of Beijing's suburbs have assigned special personnel to be responsible for loading and unloading, reducing the time to load and unload a train of cars from three hours to about one hour. The Beijing Transportation Command has also set up more than one hundred material collection and distribution points at stations and along highways in various districts and counties. During transport, carts and flatbed carts first transport agricultural and sideline products from the fields to these "points," and then trucks and trains transport them into the city; materials needed for agricultural production are first transported to the collection and distribution points by trucks and trains, and then transported to the people's communes by traditional means of transport. In the past, professional transportation departments' trucks needed to drive into the fields to transport agricultural and sideline products, which was not only inefficient but also easily damaged vehicles. Now, because trucks always travel on smooth roads, they can tow five or six trailers, increasing the carrying capacity by two or three times compared to the past.

Establishing appropriate organizational forms and management systems is an important aspect of doing a good job in relay transportation. Many districts and counties, based on local conditions, have combined the industrial, commercial, and grain departments, as well as the highways, railways, and people's communes responsible for transportation, to form joint offices, which, under the unified leadership of the Party, achieve unified coordination of transportation plans and transportation equipment forces. They also implement a "four-fixed" system of fixed points, fixed transport capacity, fixed volume, and fixed loading and unloading, further ensuring that transportation work is accurate, balanced, and planned. Pinggu County, in the case of a more than doubled amount of agricultural and sideline product purchases compared to last year and a halving of the transport labor force, properly arranged relay transportation, completing the transfer plan of agricultural and sideline products forty days earlier than last year.

    北京城乡物资实行接力运输
    运输效率提高80％，货物周转速度加快一倍
    新华社30日讯　北京运输部门在调运农副产品和农业生产物资中，采取“接力运输”的方法，使各种运输工具紧密协作、环环相扣。一个多月来，运输效率提高了80％，车辆在站的停站作业时间缩短了三分之二，货物的周转速度加快了一倍，大大发挥了车辆的潜力。
    接力运输，是以车站和公路沿线为物资集散中心，通过长途运输和短途运输、专业运输和群众性运输、现代运输工具和民间运输工具的紧密衔接，一环套一环，保证运输线上各个环节都能有节奏地进行。在采取接力运输以前，北京市所属十七个区、县的党组织，都对有关单位的职工进行了“一盘棋”的思想教育，使大家认识到采用接力运输把分散的、多环节的运输有机地衔接起来，连成一气的好处，并且要求各有关部门、各种运输工具和装卸力量，统一行动，环环相扣。这样，就为调动各方面力量开展群众性的短途运输运动创造良好条件。
    北京郊区各人民公社生产队在接力运输中，都设有专人负责装卸，使装卸一列汽车的时间，从过去三小时缩短到一小时左右。北京市运输指挥部还在各区、县的车站和公路上，设置了一百多个物资集运点。运送时，先由马车、排子车等运输工具，将农副产品从田间运到这些“点”上，然后由汽车、火车运进城市；农业生产所需的物资，先由汽车、火车运到集运地点，然后由民间运输工具运到人民公社。过去，专业运输部门的汽车运送农副产品，需要开到田里运货，不仅运输效率低，而且容易损坏车辆。现在，因为汽车始终在平坦的公路上行驶，可以拖挂五、六节拖车，载运量比以往增加了二、三倍。
    建立适当的组织形式和管理制度，是搞好接力运输的重要环节。许多区、县根据当地情况，把工业、商业、粮食部门，以及承担运输的公路、铁路和人民公社共同组成联合办公室，在党的统一领导下，做到调运计划和运输设备力量调度统一。并且实行定点、定运力、定运量、定装卸的“四定”制度，使运输工作进一步做到准确、均衡和有计划，平谷县在今年农副产品收购量比去年增加一倍多、运输劳力减少一半的情况下，妥善安排了接力运输，使农副产品的调运计划反而比去年提前四十天完成。
