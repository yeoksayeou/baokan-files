　　Huian County Hongqi Commune Fully Mobilizes Production Enthusiasm by Assigning Barren Hills to Production Teams for Management
　　Suixian County Lishan Commune's Guangming Production Team Systematically Afforests, Transforming Fuel Shortages into Surplus

　　This newspaper reports that Jinshui Brigade of Hongqi Commune in Huian, Fujian Province, located along the coast and traditionally short of fuel, has planted red treasure grass, sand reeds, and giant reeds on barren hills, vacant land, and field ridges, achieving self-sufficiency in canteen fuel with a surplus.
　　In the past, Jinshui Brigade mainly used rice straw, wheat stalks, and sweet potato vines as fuel, but still lacked more than 7,000 dan of fuel each year. Commune members had to purchase fuel everywhere or travel more than 50 li to Jinjiang County to cut grass. Now, the entire brigade has established more than 3,700 mu of fuel bases, which can harvest more than 14,000 dan of dry firewood and grass each year, enabling the brigade's ten canteens to achieve fuel self-sufficiency since last year. This year, they also sold more than 770 dan to support other brigades, increasing income by nearly 2,000 yuan. With sufficient fuel, commune members do not need to go out to cut grass, saving more than 20,000 workdays each year from this item alone. At the same time, planting sand reeds and red treasure grass on barren hills, bare hills, field ridges, and stream banks has greened the bare mountains and red earth, controlling soil erosion and preventing wind and sand hazards, which has greatly helped protect the normal growth of various crops and promote agricultural production increase. After achieving fuel self-sufficiency, wheat stalks, rice straw, peanut vines, sweet potato vines, etc., which were previously burned as firewood, have been used extensively as pig feed, greatly promoting pig production.
　　The establishment of a fuel base in Jinshui Brigade is the result of fully leveraging the superiority of the people's commune. After 1958, the commune uniformly adjusted land and assigned bare hills and barren mountains to production teams for management, mobilizing the enthusiasm of the production teams and enabling them to plant according to local conditions. The commune also rationally adjusted seedlings according to the principle of equivalent exchange, thus greatly accelerating the development of fuel bases.
　　The Huian County Party Committee and the Hongqi Commune Party Committee attach great importance to the advanced experience of Jinshui Brigade in establishing fuel bases. This year, they have successively held several on-site meetings in this brigade to vigorously promote this experience.

　　This newspaper reports that Guangming Production Team of Wufeng Management District, Lishan People's Commune, Suixian County, Hubei Province, has been planting trees and afforesting every year since liberation, taking a long-term view and starting with the present. After ten years of hard work, it has covered all 12,800 mu of barren hills with greenery, of which more than 8,700 mu have become forests, and the small trees in the more than 4,000 mu of closed-off afforestation areas are also growing well.
　　Guangming Production Team is a production team led by Zhang Chengxin, a national model worker in forestry, located in a hilly area. The original part of the forest was completely cut down by the Japanese invaders during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Therefore, the lack of firewood became a serious problem in the lives of the masses. Every winter and early spring, each household had to use at least one laborer to cut thatch and shovel sod, or travel sixty or seventy miles to Suinan and Suebei to buy firewood, which greatly affected agricultural production. In the winter of 1950, under the leadership of poor peasant Zhang Chengxin, seven peasant households planted the first batch of pine trees and acorns on 480 mu of barren hills. Since then, the mutual aid group has expanded year by year, and the number of trees planted has increased year by year. In 1953, they cut down the lower branches of pine trees for the first time and had firewood, which greatly influenced the farmers far and near. Subsequently, during the elementary and advanced agricultural production cooperatives, a mass movement of planting trees and afforestation emerged. After the birth of the people's commune, all 12,800 mu of barren hills here were planted with trees.
　　In Guangming Production Team, out of 340 laborers, about 10% were cutting firewood outside in winter and spring. Since solving the firewood problem, this batch of laborers has been put into agricultural production. Since 1955, the cultivated area has been expanding year by year. Now, the cultivated area of the entire team has increased by 53% compared with the 2,540 mu just after liberation. At the same time, they also changed the habit of planting trees and afforestation only in spring, and vigorously carried out winter tree planting and afforestation, which can free up about 2,000 workdays for spring wheat field management and spring plowing production to improve crop yields. The hills here are mostly sandy soil, and the scouring phenomenon was very serious in the past. Large-scale tree planting and afforestation not only plays a role in maintaining water and soil and protecting farmland, but also promotes the increase of crop yields.
　　At present, this production team not only has sufficient firewood for canteens and commune member families, but also supplies 50,000 to 60,000 jin of firewood to the team's kilns, flour mills, and oil presses every month, developing sideline production. Since 1955, they have begun to sell firewood to other places. In 1957, this income was 2,005 yuan, and this year, it has already reached more than 5,000 yuan. The pine trees planted in the early years have now become timber. Since 1958, they have used their own wood to build 38 houses, and also built a batch of pigsties, toilets, and made more than 70 flatbed carts. Due to sufficient firewood, wheat straw and rice straw can be used as cattle feed. Before long, they will be able to provide timber to the state to support national construction, and the income of commune members will also increase further.
　　Now, Guangming Production Team is continuing to develop fruit tree forests and economic forests, and is developing in the direction of intercropping forests and food crops.

### 植树种草建立燃料基地  惠安县红旗公社将荒山划归生产队经营充分调动了生产积极性  随县厉山公社光明生产队有计划造林使燃料由严重不足变有余

    植树种草建立燃料基地
    惠安县红旗公社将荒山划归生产队经营充分调动了生产积极性
    随县厉山公社光明生产队有计划造林使燃料由严重不足变有余
    本报讯　地处沿海、一向燃料不足的福建省惠安红旗公社锦水大队，利用荒山空地、田埂，大种赤宝草、沙竿、大竿草，已做到食堂燃料自给有余。
    锦水大队以往主要用稻草、麦秆、薯藤等作燃料，但是每年还缺少燃料七千多担，社员不得不到处购买，或跋涉五十多里到晋江县去割草。现在全队建立了三千七百多亩燃料基地，每年可收获干柴草一万四千多担，使全队十个食堂自去年起就实现了燃料自给，今年还出售七百七十多担，支援其他大队，增加了近二千元的收入。由于燃料充足，社员不用外出割草，单这一项每年就节省了二万多个劳动日。同时利用荒山、秃山、田埂、溪岸等大种沙竿、赤宝草后，使秃山赤地绿化，既控制了水土流失，又防止了风沙为害，对保护各种农作物的正常生长，促进农业增产起了很大作用。燃料自给后，过去当作柴火烧的麦秆、稻草、花生藤、甘薯藤等已大量用作养猪饲料，大大促进了养猪生产。
    锦水大队建立燃料基地，是充分发挥了人民公社优越性的结果。1958年后，公社统一调整土地，将秃山、荒山划归生产队管理，调动了生产队的积极性，使之能因地进行种植。公社还根据等价交换原则，合理调剂了种苗，因此大大加快了燃料基地的发展。
    中共惠安县委和红旗公社党委十分重视锦水大队建立燃料基地的先进经验，今年先后在这个大队召开多次现场会议，大力推广这一经验。
    本报讯　湖北随县厉山人民公社五凤管理区光明生产队，从长远打算，从眼前下手，解放后年年植树造林，经过十年奋斗，已使全队一万二千八百多亩秃山披上了绿装，其中八千七百多亩已经成林，四千多亩封山育林区的小树也长得很好。
    光明生产队是全国林业劳动模范张成新领导的一个生产队，处于丘陵地带。这里原有的部分林木，在抗日战争时期，被日寇砍伐已尽。因此，缺柴便成为群众生活中一个严重问题。每逢十冬腊月、正二三月，每户人家至少要以一个劳动力在外砍茅草、铲草皮，或者远走六七十里路到随南、随北买柴，对农业生产影响很大。1950年冬季，在贫农张成新领导下，七户农民在四百八十亩荒山上栽下第一批松树和橡子树。此后，互助组年年扩大，树也一年比一年栽得多。1953年，他们第一次砍下了松树的脚枝，有了烧柴，给远近农民以很大影响。接着，在初级和高级农业生产合作社时，就出现了植树造林的群众性运动。在人民公社诞生以后，这里的一万二千八百多亩秃山就全部栽上了树。
    光明生产队，三百四十个劳动力，往年冬春两季，总有大约10％左右的劳动力在外砍烧柴。自从解决烧柴问题以后，这批劳动力就投入了农业生产，1955年以来，耕地面积年年扩大，现在全队耕地比刚解放时的二千五百四十亩，增加了53％。同时，他们还改变了以往只有春季植树造林的习惯，大搞冬季植树造林，可以腾出约两千个劳动工日用于春季麦田管理和春耕生产，以提高农作物产量。这里的山岗多是沙质土壤，过去冲刷现象十分严重。大量植树造林，不仅发挥了保持水土、保护农田的作用，也促进了农作物产量的提高。
    目前，这个生产队不仅食堂和社员家庭烧柴充足，而且每月供应本队窑场、粉坊、榨坊五、六万斤烧柴，发展了副业生产。从1955年起，他们就开始向外出卖烧柴，1957年这笔收入是二千零五元，今年截至目前已收入五千多元。最初几年种植的松树，现在已经成材。从1958年以来，他们用自己的木料修建房屋三十八间，还修建了一批猪圈、厕所，制造了七十多辆板车。由于烧柴充足，麦秸和稻草就可以用作耕牛饲料。不用很久时间，他们就可以向国家提供木材，支援国家建设，社员收入也将有更大的增加。
    现在，光明生产队还在继续发展果木林和经济林，并向林粮间作的方向发展。
