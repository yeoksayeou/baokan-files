Relying on the Masses and Uniting the Majority is the Fundamental Guarantee for Achieving Revolutionary Victory
Chen Yu

Volume Four of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" concentrates the major works of Comrade Mao Zedong during the Third Revolutionary Civil War. During this period, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people achieved the great victory of the New Democratic Revolution, overthrew the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and established a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, opening a new chapter in Chinese history. From then on, the Chinese people were freed from their oppressed and enslaved status, became masters of the country, and controlled their own destiny. The victory of the Chinese revolution was a victory for Marxism-Leninism and a victory for Mao Zedong Thought. Volume Four of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" is a historical record of this great victory.

Comrade Mao Zedong was most adept at combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, and most adept at combining the leadership of the Party with the broad masses of the people. Once Mao Zedong Thought was grasped by the broad masses, it became a powerful material force. Comrade Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary steadfastness and thoroughness, his revolutionary optimism, which dared to struggle and dared to win, were based on the proletarian world view, and grounded in the Marxist-Leninist scientific analysis of the Chinese revolution and boundless confidence in the revolutionary power of the people. Using the proletarian world view as a tool for observing the fate of the nation, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that China's democratic revolution "is not any other revolution; it can only be and must be a revolution led by the proletariat, of the masses, and against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism." ① The people mentioned here include workers, peasants, independent laborers, freelancers, intellectuals, the national bourgeoisie, and a portion of enlightened gentry who have broken away from the feudal class, with the laboring people as the main body and the proletariat (through the Communist Party) as the leader. This revolution was a product of class contradictions in China's semi-feudal and semi-colonial society. It conformed to the needs of China's social development and the interests and demands of the Chinese people. Therefore, it had a broad and deep social foundation. Over a hundred years of imperialist aggression and oppression, and over twenty years of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule, brought suffering, backwardness, poverty, and ignorance to the Chinese people. This created hatred for imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, "forcing the Chinese people's revolutionary spirit to flourish and unite in struggle" ②, thus enabling over 90% of the people to join the revolution, becoming the political and mass foundation for guaranteeing the victory of the revolution.

The revolutionary movement is a movement of the people themselves to liberate themselves. The leading role of our Party lies in educating the masses with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, raising their awareness, organizing them, and leading them in revolutionary struggle under the guidance of the Party's policies to seize revolutionary victory. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The basic principle of Marxism-Leninism is to enable the masses to recognize their own interests and unite to fight for their own interests." ③ Comrade Mao Zedong has always emphasized firmly relying on the masses, boldly mobilizing the masses, uniting the vast majority of people, and launching a broad mass revolutionary movement. As early as the First Revolutionary Civil War, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that our revolution "must pay attention to uniting our true friends in order to attack our true enemies." ④ During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the political line of "boldly mobilizing the masses, strengthening the people's forces, and, under the leadership of our Party, defeating the invaders and building a new China" ⑤, and the strategic principle of "utilizing contradictions, winning over the majority, opposing the minority, and defeating them one by one." ⑥ Comrade Mao Zedong often said: The people are truly great, and the creativity of the masses is endless. We are invincible only if we rely on the people; only the people are the true creators of history, and true history is the history of the people. Under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought, the revolutionary forces in China have continuously developed and grown stronger, the revolutionary enemies have become increasingly isolated, and the revolution has achieved one victory after another.

Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on relying on the masses, uniting the majority, strengthening the people's forces, and overthrowing the reactionaries developed the Marxist-Leninist doctrine on revolutionary strategy and tactics. This thought was fully developed during the Third Revolutionary Civil War. During this period, after years of hard struggle, the Chinese people drove out Japanese imperialism and yearned for the realization of national independence, domestic peace, and democracy. However, Chiang Kai-shek implemented a policy of dictatorship, civil war, and national betrayal. With the support of US imperialism in terms of money and weapons, Chiang Kai-shek launched an unprecedented civil war on a national scale, wantonly massacring the Chinese people. In order to consolidate his reactionary rule, Chiang Kai-shek did not hesitate to sell out China's territorial sovereignty and turn China into a colony of US imperialism. This caused the vast working people of China to fall into starvation and death. On the one hand, the anti-popular activities of US imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek were bound to be resisted by people from all walks of life in China, making them increasingly isolated; on the other hand, the People's Liberation War, with its patriotic, just, and revolutionary nature, was bound to win the support of the people throughout the country, making the revolutionary mass base very broad and deep. However, in order to achieve a complete revolutionary victory, it was also necessary to be good at using correct strategies and tactics, grasp favorable situations, win over all possible people, strengthen the revolutionary forces, and isolate the enemy to the greatest extent. Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on firmly relying on the masses, uniting over 90% of the people to form a revolutionary united front, and overthrowing the reactionaries is precisely the application and development of Marxist-Leninist strategic and tactical thinking. This revolutionary united front is, firstly, led by the working class (through the Communist Party). Without the leadership of the Communist Party, the revolutionary united front would not exist. Any weakening of the Party's leadership would mean surrendering the leadership of the revolution to the bourgeoisie, meaning the failure of the revolution, which cannot be tolerated. Secondly, it is based on the worker-peasant alliance. The working class, peasants, and other laboring people are the main body of the revolutionary united front and the forces that determine the nature of the revolution. Only on the basis of the worker-peasant alliance is it possible to unite all other people who can be united. Without this alliance, the leadership of the working class becomes empty talk, and the working class becomes a commander without an army. Thirdly, it is also necessary to unite the majority of the national bourgeoisie (excluding the small number of right-wing elements within the national bourgeoisie who are dependent on imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism and oppose the people's democratic revolution), as well as the small number of enlightened gentry who have broken away from the feudal class, so that they can participate in the struggle against the US and Chiang, or adopt a neutral attitude in the struggle. The left-wing elements of the national bourgeoisie who rely on the laboring people to oppose the reactionaries, as well as the enlightened gentry, although they are not the forces that determine the nature of the Chinese revolution, are also one of the revolutionary forces, and should be united even more. Fourthly, the targets of attack should be limited to the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, which represents the interests of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, in order to isolate the enemy to the greatest extent and overthrow it completely. In this way, we have the broadest revolutionary united front, including over 90% of the people, under the leadership of the Party, and the victory of the revolution is guaranteed.

Comrade Mao Zedong's strategic and tactical thinking, specifically manifested in the struggle of rural land reform, is to rely on the poor peasants, firmly unite with the middle peasants, neutralize the rich peasants, and eliminate the feudal and semi-feudal exploitation system of the landlord class and the old-style rich peasants in a planned and step-by-step manner, by region and by stage. In the process of eliminating the feudal and semi-feudal exploitation system of the landlord class and the old-style rich peasants, the landlords and rich peasants are differentiated, and distinctions are made between large, medium, and small landlords, and between despotic and non-despotic elements among landlords and rich peasants. Specifically manifested in the urban struggle, it is to "wholeheartedly rely on the working class, unite with other laboring masses, win over the intellectuals, and win over as many national bourgeois elements and their representatives as possible who can cooperate with us to stand on our side, or keep them neutral, in order to wage a resolute struggle against the imperialists, the Kuomintang, and the bureaucrat-bourgeoisie, and defeat these enemies step by step." ⑦

Of course, having the correct strategy and tactics does not mean that the revolutionary tasks have been accomplished. The line, policies, and policies formulated by our Party based on this correct strategic and tactical thinking must be grasped by the masses and transformed into mass action. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The basic principle of Marxism-Leninism is to enable the masses to recognize their own interests and unite to fight for their own interests." "Being good at turning the Party's policies into mass action, being good at making every movement and every struggle understood and mastered not only by the leading cadres but also by the broad masses is an art of Marxist-Leninist leadership." ⑧ Comrade Mao Zedong was not only good at combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution to put forward revolutionary lines, policies, and policies, but also good at turning lines, policies, and policies into mass action. The most basic thing is to boldly mobilize the masses and develop revolutionary mass movements. Whether or not to rely on the masses and whether or not to dare to boldly mobilize the masses is the primary mark distinguishing proletarian politicians from bourgeois politicians, and it is also an important sign of whether or not one dares to seize revolutionary victory. Without relying on the masses, without daring to boldly mobilize the masses, and without the support of the broad masses, the lines, policies, and policies formulated by the Party will become empty talk on paper if only a few people take care of them. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the right opportunists put forward the slogan that everything must go through the united front, which was, in reality, "a concession to the Kuomintang's anti-people policy, trusting the Kuomintang more than trusting the people, and not daring to boldly launch mass struggles." ⑨ Our Party waged a resolute struggle against this right opportunist error and thoroughly overcame it, ensuring the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. During the Liberation War, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, we persisted in the policy of boldly mobilizing the masses, and the revolutionary mass movements such as rent reduction and interest reduction, land reform, and the student movement against hunger, civil war, and persecution in the areas ruled by Chiang Kai-shek were concrete manifestations. These mass movements were able to develop so rapidly and universally throughout the country, on the one hand, because they fully conformed to the needs of the development of the situation and the demands of the masses at that time, and on the other hand, also because the Party was able to adopt concrete steps that fully conformed to the degree of awareness of the masses in the specific guidance of these movements. Leading mass movements must be based on the degree of awareness and demands of the masses, and inspire the masses' conscious voluntariness through the masses' own personal experience. Only the actions of the masses that are truly conscious and voluntary are true mass movements. If the masses have awareness and demands, and we do not lead the masses in struggle, we will become divorced from the masses; if the masses are not yet aware and have no demands, and we only "move the masses" according to our own subjective wishes, we will also become divorced from the masses. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "When the masses are not yet aware, it is adventurism if we want to attack... When the masses demand to move forward, it is right opportunism if we do not move forward." ⑩ Comrade Mao Zedong precisely proceeded from the degree of awareness and demands of the masses, and led the masses to launch struggles in a planned and step-by-step manner according to different regions and different situations, thus uniting all those who could be united in the struggle, gradually raising the awareness of the masses, strengthening the strength of the masses, concentrating forces to attack the main enemies, thereby isolating the enemy to the greatest extent and accelerating the victory of the revolutionary war.

The development of the revolutionary mass movement is the result of the Party educating the masses and raising their awareness; at the same time, the revolutionary mass movement is the best form of educating the masses and raising their awareness. We must constantly educate the masses, raise their political awareness, and improve their level of understanding of the Party's line, policies, and policies through this practical struggle in which the masses participate themselves, through the constant victories achieved in the struggle (and of course, also through the setbacks and failures that will inevitably be encountered in the struggle), and through the personal benefits that the masses gain in the struggle. We must educate the masses to recognize who our enemies are and who our friends are; to recognize the reactionary nature and conspiracies of the enemies, to recognize the greatness of the people's revolutionary forces, thereby having a strong confidence in the revolutionary future; to recognize where the fundamental interests of the masses lie, and to be determined to fight for the realization of these fundamental interests. Comrade Mao Zedong has more than once pointed out the leading forces, revolutionary friends, and revolutionary enemies of the New Democratic Revolution based on the class analysis of Chinese society, educating all Party cadres and the broad masses to distinguish between the enemy, friends, and ourselves. He often asked us to draw a clear line between revolution and counter-revolution and between right and wrong. Comrade Mao Zedong unreservedly exposed the reactionary nature and conspiracies of Chiang Kai-shek in order to educate the masses and raise their awareness, so that the people maintained a high degree of vigilance against all of Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary conspiracies and carried out tit-for-tat struggles. When the revolution encountered difficulties and dark clouds temporarily appeared in the sky, Comrade Mao Zedong made a Marxist-Leninist scientific analysis of the revolutionary situation, pointed out the bright future and prospects of the revolution, inspired the revolutionary confidence of the masses, and strengthened the revolutionary will of the masses. It was under the constant education and encouragement of Comrade Mao Zedong that all our Party members and the people of the whole country constantly improved their ideological awareness and Marxist-Leninist level, thereby laying a solid ideological foundation for the victory of the revolution. It is an important aspect of the combination of the Party's leadership and the broad masses to educate the masses with Marxism-Leninism and the Party's line, policies, and policies, and to arm the masses' minds.

Because our Party adhered to Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on relying on the masses and uniting the majority, because it adopted the policy of boldly mobilizing the masses and launching revolutionary mass movements, and because it strengthened political and ideological education for the masses in the struggle and constantly raised the awareness of the masses, the broad masses of the people, who accounted for more than 90% of the country's population, united under the leadership of the Party, and the reactionaries represented by Chiang Kai-shek were completely isolated, which ensured the complete victory of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution.

Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on relying on the masses and uniting the majority is not only the most important ideological weapon for uniting ourselves and defeating the enemy during the Liberation War, but also has extremely important, realistic, and universal guiding significance for the socialist revolution and socialist construction we are currently engaged in. From personal experience, I feel that the following points are particularly worth learning:

First, rely on the masses, unite the majority, win over all possible people, and mobilize all positive factors to serve the socialist revolution and socialist construction. The ultimate goal of the proletarian-led revolution is to realize mankind's greatest ideal - communism. Although the historical tasks to be accomplished by the New Democratic Revolution, the Socialist Revolution, and Socialist Construction are different, they are all struggling to create conditions in order to finally realize this great ideal. Therefore, they all have a patriotic, revolutionary, and just nature, represent the interests of the vast majority of people, and receive the support and endorsement of the broad masses of people. And the strength of the people is endless and is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of the revolution. This determines that the revolutionary cause led by the proletariat must and can unite the majority, win over all possible people, and seize victory. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "As long as we rely on the people, firmly believe that the creativity of the masses is endless, and therefore trust the people and become one with the people, then any difficulty can be overcome, and any enemy cannot overwhelm us, but will only be overwhelmed by us." ? As long as we act in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's words, always stand with more than 90% of the people, and always represent their interests, we will not be divorced from the masses, we will not be isolated, we will be full of confidence in the revolutionary cause, and we will not be afraid of any difficulties, and we will not be intimidated by difficulties. Even when the revolutionary new forces are still in a weak position and in a minority position, they can foresee the future of victory, and thus dare to persist in the struggle and dare to seize victory. Conversely, if we do not understand how to rely on the masses and do not understand how to unite the majority, we will inevitably overestimate the strength of the enemy, overestimate the difficulties, and underestimate our own strength. As a result, we will lose confidence in the revolutionary future, fear, waver, and be pessimistic and disappointed; or we will harbor illusions about the enemies of the revolution, and the result will inevitably be the opposite, causing the revolution to suffer setbacks. Comrade Mao Zedong's revolutionary optimism is not only manifested in the guidance of the revolution, but also in the guidance of socialist construction. He has boundless trust in the industrious and brave Chinese people and an extremely strong confidence in the future of socialist construction. In March 1949, when the revolution was about to achieve a national victory, he clearly pointed out to us: "We are not only good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world." He also said: "The speed of China's economic construction will not be slow but may be quite fast, and China's prosperity can be counted on the fingers. There is no basis for the pessimistic view of China's economic recovery." ? Countless facts in the eleven years since the founding of China, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, have fully confirmed Comrade Mao Zedong's predictions.

It is particularly important to point out that Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of correctly handling contradictions among the people, put forward during the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, is of very great significance. Comrade Mao Zedong's purpose in correctly handling contradictions among the people is to: "Mobilize all positive factors, unite all those who can be united, and transform negative factors into positive factors as much as possible to serve the great cause of building a socialist society." ? This theoretical principle established by Comrade Mao Zedong has had a profound impact on the cause of socialist construction. Since 1958, under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist theory on correctly handling contradictions among the people, and under the brilliant light of the general line for socialist construction, the people of the whole country have mobilized all the positive factors that can be mobilized, and have united all the people who can be united, forming an irresistible torrent of mass movement. Consequently, our country's socialist construction has been leaping forward wave after wave, one upsurge after another.

Second, in revolution and construction, we must adhere to the policy of self-reliance. The idea of self-reliance stems from the proletarian world view of believing in the strength of the masses and relying on the masses to liberate themselves, and from the strategic thinking of the entire revolution. Whether or not we can be self-reliant and whether or not we want to be self-reliant, the essence of the problem is whether or not we believe in the strength of the masses and whether or not we rely on the masses. Marxists-Leninists have always believed that the liberation of the people must rely on their own strength, not on the gifts of anyone. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that our policy must "place the base point on our own strength, called self-reliance." ?"We rely entirely on self-reliance and stand on invincible ground." ? This policy is not only applicable to the New Democratic Revolution, but also to the Socialist Revolution; it is not only applicable to revolution, but also to construction. The Chinese revolution mainly relied on the revolutionary strength of the people, relied on self-reliance and hard struggle, and overcame countless difficulties to achieve victory. In the eleven years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, we have still been implementing the policy of relying on the masses and self-reliance to carry out socialist construction. We are able to develop the national economy at the speed of the Great Leap Forward, mainly relying on the soaring energy of the masses, relying on the hard work and bravery of the masses, and relying on the intelligence and wisdom of the masses. Without these, it is unimaginable that our socialist construction would have achieved such great achievements.

Of course, our emphasis on implementing the policy of self-reliance does not mean that we do not want international aid and support. On the contrary, we have always attached importance to international aid and support. During the period of our country's democratic revolution and in the socialist construction after the founding of the People's Republic of China, our ability to achieve one victory after another has depended upon and been inseparable from the support of the international working class, especially the assistance of the Soviet and other socialist countries. In the future, in order to further accelerate our country's socialist construction, while continuing to implement the policy of relying on the masses and self-reliance, we must continue to strive for all the international assistance that can be obtained. It can be fully affirmed that as long as we firmly do so, then, no matter how many difficulties we encounter on the road forward, our country's socialist construction will achieve greater victories, and difficulties will be overcome and overcome one by one by the heroic Chinese people.

Third, boldly mobilize the masses and launch large-scale mass movements. Since revolution and construction are both undertakings of the masses seeking their own liberation and reflecting the interests and demands of the masses, they must be victorious through mass struggles and mass movements. Only by launching large-scale mass movements can the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses be fully utilized. Any restraint on the masses, fearing wolves in front and tigers behind, fearing chaos, fearing breaking pottery jars, fearing stimulating the enemy, fearing this and fearing that, is incompatible with the revolutionary spirit of Marxism-Leninism. Revolution is the soul of Marxism-Leninism. And in the revolutionary struggle, whether or not to dare to boldly mobilize the masses is an important dividing line between the revolutionary line and the opportunist line. We believe that only by conscientiously strengthening the Party's leadership over the mass movement and boldly mobilizing the masses is the most thorough revolutionary line; otherwise, we will commit right opportunist errors. This is true not only in the revolutionary struggle but also in socialist construction. Of course, our emphasis on boldly mobilizing the masses does not mean following behind the masses and doing whatever the masses want. This would abandon the Party's leadership over the masses and would not only prevent a true mass movement from developing, but also prevent the smooth development of the revolution and construction and harm the interests of the masses. This is completely wrong. The correct approach should be to combine the implementation of the opinions of the masses with the leadership and education of the masses. This is what Comrade Mao Zedong told us: "The Party must, according to the situation, lead the masses and realize all the correct opinions of the people; and for the incorrect opinions that occur among the people, it must educate the masses and correct them." ? This shows that boldly mobilizing the masses and strengthening the Party's leadership are completely consistent. Using various reasons to restrain the masses and not daring to boldly mobilize the masses is completely wrong at any time.

Some people believe that revolution can launch large-scale mass movements, but construction cannot launch mass movements; or agricultural production can launch mass movements, but industrial production cannot launch mass movements; or production can launch mass movements, but scientific and technological research cannot launch mass movements. The essence of this view is not to have mass movements, and even to oppose mass movements. This is a reflection of bourgeois ideology in our revolutionary ranks. They do not believe in the masses at all, do not believe that the masses can liberate themselves, and regard the revolutionary and construction cause as the affair of a few "heroic" figures, and regard the fruits of victory obtained by the people in the struggle as the gift of a few "heroic" figures to the masses. They not only do not dare to boldly mobilize the masses but also restrict the actions of the masses within the framework they have set up, restricting the hands and feet of the masses and not allowing them to step beyond it. When they see some shortcomings in the movement, they analyze and point fingers from the sidelines, and even pour cold water on it. This is completely wrong. Following their ideas will inevitably make the socialist construction cause cold and quiet and stagnate. This is completely contrary to the spirit of our Party's general line. The essence of the Party's general line for socialist construction is to maximize the enthusiasm and creativity of the people of the whole country, that is, to adopt the mass line method and launch large-scale mass movements under the leadership of the Party, to develop our country's national economy at a high speed and in proportion, and to build our country into a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture as soon as possible. The experience of socialist construction in the past eleven years, especially in the past three years, has fully proved the correctness of the above-mentioned line and policy. In the past eleven years, especially in the past three years, we have made rapid progress in industry, agriculture, and science and culture, and the speed of development is unprecedented. These amazing achievements are the result of boldly mobilizing the masses and launching large-scale mass movements on all fronts. Without the vigorous mass movement, these achievements are unimaginable. The liberated Chinese people are the masters of the country and control their own destiny; their labor is not for enriching the exploiters but for their own bright future; in their struggle with nature, they are also gradually breaking away from being dominated by nature and gradually becoming the masters who dominate nature; they are not satisfied with the backward position caused by China's long-term reactionary rule and have an urgent need to change this backward situation of "poverty and blankness." All of these will inevitably generate endless power, and this power is inestimable. Insufficient understanding of this enormous potential will inevitably lead to serious mistakes.

Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on relying on the masses and uniting the majority; his thought on self-reliance; his thought on boldly mobilizing the masses and launching large-scale mass movements; and his thought on correctly handling contradictions among the people and mobilizing all positive factors are based on the world view of dialectical materialism and historical materialism. Comrade Mao Zedong had unlimited concern and unlimited loyalty to the interests of the people, had unlimited trust in the strength of the people, and maintained the closest ties with the broad masses of the people. He said: "All the words and actions of Communists must be in accordance with the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the people and must be supported by the broadest masses of the people as the highest standard." ? He also said: "It must be clear that the masses are the real heroes, and we ourselves are often naive and ridiculous." ? In leading the cause of revolution and construction, Comrade Mao Zedong was the advocate of the mass line and a model for implementing the mass line. Comrade Mao Zedong mastered the method of class analysis, and through class analysis, not only profoundly understood the essence of each class but also understood the attitudes of different strata of each class towards the revolution, which also had different degrees of distinction in a certain period. Based on these analyses, we can determine the Party's line, policies, strategies, and tactics, which can not only clarify the boundaries between ourselves and the enemy but also expand the scope of unity, strengthen the revolutionary forces, isolate the reactionary forces, and guide our country's revolution and construction from victory to victory.

Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on firmly relying on the masses, uniting over 90% of the people to form a revolutionary united front, and overthrowing the reactionaries is of extremely important significance for the current struggle against imperialism and colonialism, for the struggle to win lasting world peace, and for the struggle to win the victory of the world proletarian revolution. Historical facts show that the people's revolutionary cause led by the Communist Party will certainly receive the support and endorsement of the largest number of the people, we will certainly be able to unite the largest number of people, and thus we will certainly be able to achieve victory. This is the law of historical development and is independent of people's will. Although there are many difficulties and twists and turns in the revolutionary process, and although the revolutionary forces are sometimes in a disadvantaged position, and even sometimes encounter failures, while the enemies of the revolution may be complacent and rampant for a time, all these are only temporary phenomena and can never change the basic process of historical development. The historical development of China is so, and the historical development of the world is no different.

    依靠群众，团结多数是取得革命胜利的根本保证
    陈郁
    《毛泽东选集》第四卷，集中了毛泽东同志在第三次国内革命战争时期的主要著作。这一时期，中国人民在毛泽东思想指导下取得了新民主主义革命的伟大胜利，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的反动统治，建立了以工人阶级为领导，以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的国家，开辟了中国历史的新纪元。从此，中国人民摆脱了被压迫被奴役的地位，成为国家的主人，掌握了自己的命运。中国革命的胜利是马克思列宁主义的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。《毛泽东选集》第四卷，就是这个伟大胜利的历史纪录。
    毛泽东同志最善于把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践相结合，最善于把党的领导同广大群众相结合。毛泽东思想一经为广大群众所掌握，就成为强大的物质力量。毛泽东同志那种敢于斗争、敢于胜利的无产阶级革命的坚定性和彻底性，那种革命的乐观主义精神，是建立在无产阶级世界观的基础上，并以对中国革命的马克思列宁主义的科学分析，和对人民群众的革命力量抱着无限信心为依据的。毛泽东同志用无产阶级世界观作为观察国家命运的工具，指出中国的民主革命“不是任何别的革命，它只能是和必须是无产阶级领导的，人民大众的，反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的革命。”①这里所说的人民大众，包括工人、农民、独立劳动者、自由职业者、知识分子、民族资产阶级以及从封建阶级分裂出来的一部分开明绅士，而以劳动人民为主体，以无产阶级
  （经过共产党）为领导。这个革命是中国半封建半殖民地社会阶级矛盾的产物。它是符合中国社会发展的需要，符合中国人民的利益和要求的。因此它具有广泛而深厚的社会基础。一百多年来帝国主义的侵略和压迫，二十多年来蒋介石的反动统治，给中国人民带来了苦难、落后、贫困和愚昧，这就造成了中国人民对帝国主义和蒋介石反动派的仇恨，“迫使中国人的革命精神发扬起来，从斗争中团结起来”②，从而使90％以上的人走到革命方面来，成为保证革命取得胜利的政治基础和群众基础。
    革命运动是人民群众自己解放自己的运动。我们党的领导作用在于以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想教育群众，提高群众的觉悟，并把他们组织起来，在党的方针政策指导下，进行革命斗争，夺取革命的胜利。毛泽东同志指出：“马克思列宁主义的基本原则，就是要使群众认识自己的利益，并且团结起来，为自己的利益而奋斗。”③毛泽东同志历来都非常强调坚决依靠群众，放手发动群众，把绝大多数的人团结起来，掀起广大群众性的革命运动。早在第一次国内革命战争时期，毛泽东同志就指出：我们的革命“不可不注意团结我们的真正的朋友，以攻击我们的真正的敌人。”④在抗日战争时期，毛泽东同志提出了“放手发动群众，壮大人民力量，在我们党的领导下，打败侵略者，建设新中国”⑤的政治路线，和“利用矛盾，争取多数，反对少数，各个击破”⑥的策略原则。毛泽东同志经常说：人民群众是真正伟大的，群众的创造力，是无穷无尽的。我们只有依靠人民群众，才是不可战胜的，只有人民群众，才是历史的真正创造者，真正的历史是人民群众的历史。在毛泽东同志这个思想指导下，中国革命力量不断发展和壮大，革命敌人越来越孤立，革命也就一个胜利接着一个胜利。
    毛泽东同志关于依靠群众，团结多数，壮大人民力量，打倒反动派的思想，发展了马克思列宁主义关于革命的战略策略的学说。这个思想，在第三次国内革命战争时期得到充分的发挥。这个时期，中国人民经过多年的奋战，才把日本帝国主义赶跑，渴望着实现民族的独立，国内的和平和民主。但是蒋介石却实行独裁、内战和卖国的政策。在美帝国主义出钱出枪支持之下，蒋介石在全国范围内发动了空前规模的内战，大肆屠杀中国人民。蒋介石为了巩固自己的反动统治，不惜出卖中国的领土主权，把中国变为美帝国主义的殖民地。这样，就使中国广大的劳动人民陷于饥饿和死亡线上。一方面，由于美帝国主义和蒋介石这些反人民的罪恶活动，必然遭到中国各阶层人民的反抗，使他们越来越孤立；另一方面，由于人民解放战争具有爱国的、正义的、革命的性质，必然获得全国人民的拥护，这就使得革命的群众基础十分广泛和深厚。但是要取得革命的彻底胜利，还必须善于运用正确的战略策略，掌握有利的形势，争取一切可能争取的人，壮大革命力量，并最大限度地孤立敌人。毛泽东同志关于坚决依靠群众，团结90％以上的人结成革命统一战线，打倒反动派的思想，正是马克思列宁主义的战略策略思想的运用和发展。这个革命统一战线，首先是以工人阶级（经过共产党）为领导的。没有共产党的领导，就没有革命的统一战线。对党的领导的任何削弱，就意味着把革命的领导权让给资产阶级，意味着革命的失败，这是不能容许的。其次，它是以工农联盟为基础的。工人阶级、农民和其他劳动人民是革命统一战线的主体，是决定革命性质的力量。只有在工农联盟的基础上，才有可能去团结其他一切可以团结的人。没有这个联盟，工人阶级的领导就成为空谈，工人阶级就成了无兵司令。第三，还要团结民族资产阶级的大多数（即不包括民族资产阶级中依附帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义，反对人民民主革命的少数右翼分子），以及从封建阶级分裂出来的少数开明绅士，使他们参加反对美蒋的斗争，或者在斗争中采取中立态度。民族资产阶级中依附劳动人民反对反动派的左翼分子以及开明绅士，虽然不是决定中国革命性质的力量，但也是革命力量之一，更应该团结他们。第四，把打击对象限制在代表帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义利益的蒋介石反动集团，以便最大限度地孤立敌人，并且把它彻底打倒。这样，我们就有了一个在党的领导下的包括90％以上的人的最广泛的革命统一战线，革命的胜利也就有了保证。
    毛泽东同志这一战略策略思想，具体表现在农村土地改革的斗争中，就是依靠贫农，巩固地联合中农，中立富农，分地区、分阶段、有准备、有步骤地消灭地主阶级和旧式富农的封建的和半封建的剥削制度。而在消灭地主阶级和旧式富农的封建的和半封建的剥削制度中，又将地主和富农加以区别，对大中小地主，对地主、富农中的恶霸和非恶霸也加以区别。具体表现在城市斗争中，就是“全心全意地依靠工人阶级，团结其他劳动群众，争取知识分子，争取尽可能多的能够同我们合作的民族资产阶级分子及其代表人物站在我们方面，或者使他们保持中立，以便向帝国主义者、国民党、官僚资产阶级作坚决的斗争，一步一步地去战胜这些敌人。”⑦
    当然，有了正确的战略策略，还不等于革命任务的实现，必须使我们党根据这个正确的战略策略思想所制订的路线、方针、政策，为群众所掌握，变成群众的行动。毛泽东同志指出：“马克思列宁主义的基本原则，就是要使群众认识自己的利益，并且团结起来，为自己的利益而奋斗。”“善于把党的政策变为群众的行动，善于使我们的每一个运动，每一个斗争，不但领导干部懂得，而且广大的群众都能懂得，都能掌握，这是一项马克思列宁主义的领导艺术。”⑧毛泽东同志不但善于根据马克思列宁主义的普遍真理结合中国革命的具体实践，提出革命的路线、方针、政策，而且善于把路线、方针、政策变成群众的行动。如何把党的路线、方针、政策变成为群众的行动呢？最基本的一条是放手发动群众，发展革命的群众运动。依靠不依靠群众，敢不敢放手发动群众，是区分无产阶级政治家和资产阶级政治家的首要标志，也是敢不敢夺取革命胜利的重要标志。不依靠群众，不敢放手发动群众，没有广大人民群众的拥护与支持，靠少数人包办代替，党所制订的路线、方针、政策就将成为纸上空谈。抗日战争时期，右倾机会主义者提出一切经过统一战线的口号，实际上“即是对于国民党的反人民政策让步，信任国民党超过信任人民群众，不敢放手发动群众斗争”⑨。我们党和这种右倾机会主义错误进行了坚决的斗争，并加以彻底的克服，保证了抗日战争的胜利。解放战争时期，在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央领导下，坚持放手发动群众的方针，在解放区普遍开展的减租减息、土地改革，以及在蒋介石统治地区的反饥饿、反内战、反迫害的学生运动等革命群众运动，就是具体的表现。这些群众运动之所以能够如此迅速地在全国各地普遍开展起来，一方面因为它完全符合当时形势发展的需要和群众的要求，另方面也因为党在对这些运动的具体指导上，能够根据不同地区，不同情况，采取完全符合群众觉悟程度的具体步骤。领导群众运动必须根据群众的觉悟程度和要求，并且通过群众的切身经验启发群众的自觉自愿。只有群众真正自觉自愿的行动，才是真正的群众运动。如果群众有了觉悟和要求，我们不去领导群众斗争，就会脱离群众；如果群众还不觉悟，还没有要求，我们只管按照自己的主观愿望去“运动群众”，那也会脱离群众的。毛泽东同志说：“当着群众还不觉悟的时候，我们要进攻，那是冒险主义。……当着群众要求前进的时候，我们不前进，那是右倾机会主义。”⑩毛泽东同志正是从群众的觉悟程度和要求出发，根据不同地区，不同情况，有计划地、有步骤地领导群众开展斗争，因而在斗争中团结了一切可能团结的人，一步一步地提高群众的觉悟，壮大群众的力量，集中力量打击最主要的敌人，从而最大限度地孤立敌人，加速了革命战争的胜利。
    革命的群众运动的发展，是党教育群众，提高了群众的觉悟的结果；同时，革命的群众运动又是教育群众，提高群众觉悟的最好形式。我们必须通过这种群众自己参加的实际斗争，通过在斗争中不断取得的胜利（当然也通过斗争中难免会碰到的某些挫折和失败），通过在斗争中群众所得到的切身利益，来不断地教育群众，提高群众的政治觉悟，和对党的路线、方针、政策的认识水平。要教育群众认识谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友；认识敌人的反动本质和阴谋，认识人民革命力量的伟大，从而对革命前途抱有坚强的信心；认识群众根本利益的所在，并决心为实现这些根本利益而奋斗。毛泽东同志不止一次地根据对中国社会的阶级分析，指出新民主主义革命的领导力量，革命的朋友和革命的敌人，教育全党干部和广大群众分清敌、友、我，他经常要求我们划清革命与反革命和正确与错误的两种界限。毛泽东同志毫不含糊地揭露蒋介石的反动本质和阴谋，借以教育群众，提高群众觉悟，使人民群众对蒋介石的一切反革命阴谋活动，保持高度警惕，并进行针锋相对的斗争。毛泽东同志在革命遇到困难，天空中暂时出现乌云的时候，对革命形势作出马克思列宁主义的科学的分析，指出革命的光明前途和远景，鼓舞群众的革命信心，坚定群众的革命意志。我们全体党员和全国人民，就是在毛泽东同志经常的教育和鼓舞下，不断提高思想觉悟和马克思列宁主义水平，从而为革命的胜利打下牢固的思想基础的。用马克思列宁主义和党的路线、方针、政策教育群众，武装群众的思想，是党的领导和广大群众相结合的一个重要方面。
    由于我们党坚持了毛泽东同志依靠群众、团结多数的思想，由于采取了放手发动群众，开展革命的群众运动的方针，并在斗争中加强对群众的政治思想教育，不断提高群众的觉悟，因而使占全国人口90％以上的广大人民群众在党的领导下团结起来了，以蒋介石为代表的反动派完全孤立了，这就保证了中国新民主主义革命的彻底胜利。
    毛泽东同志关于依靠群众，团结多数的思想，不仅在解放战争时期是团结自己，战胜敌人的最重要的思想武器，而且对于今天我们正在进行的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业，同样具有极其重要的现实的普遍的指导意义。就个人的体会，我感到下列的一些观点特别值得我们好好学习：
    第一，依靠群众，团结多数，争取一切可能争取的人，调动一切积极因素，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务。无产阶级领导的革命的最终目的，是要实现人类最伟大的理想——共产主义。新民主主义革命、社会主义革命和社会主义建设，虽然所要完成的历史任务有所不同，但都是为了创造条件，以便为最后实现这个伟大的理想而奋斗，因此，都具有爱国的、革命的、正义的性质，代表着最大多数人的利益，得到广大人民群众的支持和拥护。而人民群众的力量是无穷无尽的，是革命胜利的根本保证。这就决定了无产阶级所领导的革命事业不但必须而且能够团结多数，争取一切可能争取的人，夺取胜利。毛泽东同志说：“只要我们依靠人民，坚决地相信人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，因而信任人民，和人民打成一片，那就任何困难也能克服，任何敌人也不能压倒我们，而只会被我们所压倒。”?只要我们按照毛泽东同志的这些话去做，经常和90％以上的人站在一起，经常代表他们的利益，我们就不会脱离群众，就不会孤立，就会对革命事业充满信心，不怕任何困难，不为困难所吓倒。即使是在革命的新生力量还处在弱小的地位，处在少数地位的时候，也能预见胜利的前途，因而敢于坚持斗争，敢于夺取胜利。相反，如果不懂得依靠群众，不懂得团结多数，就必然会过高地估计敌人的力量，过高地估计困难，过低地估计自己的力量，因而对革命前途丧失信心，害怕，动摇，悲观失望；或者对革命的敌人存有幻想，其结果必然走向事情的反面，使革命遭受挫折。毛泽东同志的革命乐观主义精神，不但表现在对革命的指导上，而且表现在对社会主义建设的指导上。他对勤劳勇敢的中国人民抱着无限的信任，对社会主义建设前途抱着无比坚强的信心。在1949年3月，革命即将取得全国胜利的时候，他就明确地给我们指出：“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”又说：“中国经济建设的速度将不是很慢而可能是相当地快的，中国的兴盛是可以计日程功的。对于中国经济复兴的悲观论点，没有任何的根据。”?中国建国十一年来特别是1958年大跃进以来的无数事实，完全证实了毛泽东同志的预言。
    特别需要指出的是，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，毛泽东同志提出的关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的学说，更有着非常重大的意义。毛泽东同志提出正确处理人民内部矛盾的目的，就是要：“调动一切积极因素，团结一切可能团结的人，并且尽可能地将消极因素转变为积极因素，为建设社会主义社会这个伟大的事业服务。”?毛泽东同志所确立的这一理论原则，对社会主义建设事业发生了深远的影响。1958年以来，全国人民在毛泽东同志关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的马克思列宁主义理论指导下，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，把一切可以调动的积极因素都调动起来了，把一切可以团结的人都团结起来了，汇成了一股不可抗拒的群众运动的洪流，因而使我国的社会主义建设一浪高过一浪，一个高潮接着一个高潮地不断飞跃前进。
    第二，在革命和建设中，必须坚持自力更生的方针。自力更生的思想，是从相信群众的力量、依靠群众自己解放自己这种无产阶级的世界观出发的，是从整个革命的战略思想出发的。能不能自力更生，要不要自力更生，问题的实质就是相信不相信群众力量，依靠不依靠群众的问题。马克思列宁主义者从来认为，人民群众的解放要依靠自己的力量，而不是依靠任何人的恩赐。因此，毛泽东同志指出，我们的方针一定要“放在自己力量的基点上，叫做自力更生。”?“我们是一切依靠自力更生，立于不败之地”?。这条方针不但适用于新民主主义革命，而且适用于社会主义革命；不但适用于革命，而且适用于建设。中国的革命主要是依靠人民群众的革命力量，依靠自力更生，艰苦奋斗，克服了无数的困难而取得胜利的。中华人民共和国成立十一年来，我们仍然是贯彻依靠群众，自力更生的方针进行社会主义建设的。我们能够以大跃进的速度发展国民经济，主要是依靠群众的冲天干劲，依靠群众的勤劳勇敢，依靠群众的聪明智慧。离开了这些，我们的社会主义建设事业要取得如此伟大的成就，是不可想像的。
    当然，我们强调贯彻自力更生的方针，并不是说不要国际的援助和支持，恰恰相反，我们是一贯重视国际的援助和支持的。在我国民主革命的时期和在建国以后的社会主义建设中，我们所以能够取得一个又一个的胜利，这是和国际工人阶级的支持，特别是苏联和其它社会主义各国的援助分不开的。今后为了更加加快我国的社会主义建设，我们在继续贯彻依靠群众，自力更生的方针的同时，必须继续争取一切可以争取的国际援助。完全可以肯定，只要我们坚定地这样作，那末，不管前进的道路上还会遇到多少困难，我国的社会主义建设事业将获得更大的胜利，困难将会被英勇的中国人民一个一个地战胜，一个一个地克服。
    第三，放手发动群众，大搞群众运动。革命和建设既然都是群众求得自己解放的事业，反映群众的利益和要求，因此，必须通过群众斗争，通过群众运动才能取得胜利。只有大搞群众运动，才能把群众的积极性创造性充分发挥出来。任何束缚群众的手足，前怕狼后怕虎，怕乱，怕打烂坛坛罐罐，怕刺激敌人，怕这怕那，都是和马克思列宁主义的革命精神不相容的。革命是马克思列宁主义的灵魂。而在革命斗争中，敢不敢放手发动群众，又是革命路线与机会主义路线的重要分界线。我们认为，只有认真加强党对群众运动的领导，放手发动群众，才是最彻底的革命路线，否则就会犯右倾机会主义的错误。不仅在革命斗争中是如此，在社会主义建设中也是如此。当然，我们强调放手发动群众，并不等于跟在群众的后面跑，群众要怎么办就怎么办。这样作，放弃了党对群众的领导，就不但不可能有真正的群众运动，而且会使得革命和建设不能顺利发展，使群众的利益受损害，因而是完全错误的。正确的作法应当是，把执行群众的意见和领导、教育群众结合起来。这就是毛泽东同志告诉我们的：“凡属人民群众的正确的意见，党必须依据情况，领导群众，加以实现；而对于人民群众中发生的不正确的意见，则必须教育群众，加以改正。”?这就说明，放手发动群众，和加强党的领导是完全一致的。借口种种理由，束缚群众的手脚，不敢放手发动群众，这在任何时候都是完全错误的。
    有些人认为，革命可以大搞群众运动，建设就不可以搞群众运动；或者农业生产可以搞群众运动，工业生产就不可以搞群众运动；或者生产可以搞群众运动，科学技术研究就不可以搞群众运动。这种观点的实质就是不要群众运动，甚至是反对群众运动。这是资产阶级思想在我们革命队伍里的反映。他们根本不相信群众，不相信群众自己能够解放自己，把革命和建设事业看作少数“英雄”人物的事情，把人民群众在斗争中得来的胜利果实，看作少数“英雄”人物对群众的恩赐。他们不但不敢放手发动群众，而且把群众的行动限制在自己所设置的框框之内，束缚住群众的手脚，不许逾越半步。他们看到运动中出现了一些缺点，不加分析站在旁边指手划脚，甚至大泼冷水。这是完全错误的。按照他们的想法办事，必然把社会主义建设事业搞得冷冷清清，停滞不前。这和我们党的总路线的精神是完全相违背的。党的社会主义建设总路线的实质，就是要最大限度地发扬全国人民的积极性和创造性，也就是要在党的领导下，采用群众路线的方法，大搞群众运动，高速度地、按比例地发展我国国民经济，尽快地把我国建成一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国。十一年来特别是最近三年来的社会主义建设经验，完全证明了上述路线、方针的正确性。十一年来特别是最近三年来，我们无论在工业方面、农业方面和科学文化方面都在突飞猛进，发展的速度是史无前例的。这种惊人的成就，就是在各个战线上放手发动群众、大搞群众运动的结果。没有轰轰烈烈的群众运动，这些成就是不可想像的。解放了的中国人民，当了国家的主人，掌握了自己的命运；他们的劳动不是为了让剥削者致富，而是为了自己美好的未来；他们在和自然作斗争中，也逐步摆脱受自然支配的地位，而逐渐成为支配自然的主人；他们不满意中国长期在反动统治下所造成的落后地位，有改变这种“一穷二白”落后面貌的迫切要求。所有这些，都必然产生无穷无尽的力量，这个力量是不可估量的。对这种巨大的潜力认识不足，必然要犯严重的错误。
    毛泽东同志关于依靠群众，团结多数的思想；关于自力更生的思想，关于放手发动群众，大搞群众运动的思想；关于正确处理人民内部矛盾，调动一切积极因素的思想，是建立在辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义世界观的基础上的。毛泽东同志对人民群众的利益无限关怀，无限忠诚，对人民群众的力量无限信任，同广大人民群众保持着最密切的联系。他说：“共产党人的一切言论行动，必须以合乎最广大人民群众的最大利益，为最广大人民群众所拥护为最高标准。”?又说：“必须明白：群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的”?。在对革命和建设事业的领导中，毛泽东同志是群众路线的倡导者，又是贯彻群众路线的模范。毛泽东同志掌握了阶级分析方法，通过阶级分析，不仅深刻地认识了各个阶级的本质，而且认识了各个阶级的不同阶层对于革命的态度，在一定时期内还有不同程度的区别。根据这些分析，来确定党的路线、方针、政策、策略，既能明确敌我界限，又能扩大团结的范围，壮大革命力量，孤立反动力量，引导我国革命和建设从胜利走向胜利。
    毛泽东同志关于坚决依靠群众，团结90％以上的人结成革命统一战线，打倒反动派的思想，对当前反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的斗争，对争取世界持久和平、争取世界无产阶级革命胜利的斗争，具有极其重要的意义。历史事实表明，共产党所领导的人民革命事业一定能够得到最大多数人民群众的支持和拥护，我们一定能够团结最大多数的人，从而一定能够取得胜利。这是历史发展的规律，是不以人们的意志为转移的。尽管在革命过程中有许多困难和曲折，尽管革命力量有时处在劣势的地位，甚至有时还会遭到失败，而革命的敌人可以得意和嚣张于一时，但所有这些，都不过是暂时的现象，决不能改变历史发展的基本进程。中国的历史发展是如此，世界的历史发展也莫不如此。
