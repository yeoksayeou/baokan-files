Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 30th: On the basis of continuous great leaps forward in 1958 and 1959, Shanghai's steel industry achieved another great victory in 1960, completing the state-stipulated steel production plan for this year seventeen days ahead of schedule. The quality of steel has also improved, with the qualification rate of converter steel reaching over 97%, and eliminating third-grade products. Iron consumption has also generally decreased.

Shanghai's steel production achieved an all-round leap forward this year, which is the result of the firm implementation of the spirit of "the whole country as one chessboard" by all parts of the country, especially the provinces of East China, and their full support with various materials. Since the beginning of this year, relevant provinces and cities have continuously transported large amounts of coal, iron ore, and various auxiliary materials needed for steelmaking to Shanghai. Mines in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other places have mined a large amount of limestone for Shanghai. Many regions such as Anhui, Shandong, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Fujian, and Zhejiang have concentrated manpower and material resources to accelerate the production and transportation of pig iron, providing a reliable material guarantee for the substantial increase in Shanghai's steel production.

In order to comprehensively complete this year's production plan, Shanghai's steel workers resolutely launched a tenacious struggle against various difficulties. From the beginning of this year, they resolutely implemented technical transformations of iron smelting furnaces to improve sulfur removal efficiency. In the summer, they put forward the slogan of "fighting high temperatures, attacking high sulfur, and seizing high yields," and solved key technical problems under arduous conditions. In the autumn, production leaped forward substantially on this basis. In the fourth quarter, in the campaign to increase production and practice economy centered on grain and steel, converter steelmaking technology and production levels were greatly developed and improved.

"Politics at the Furnace" – fully mobilizing the initiative and enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and solving a series of key problems that constantly arose in production – is an important experience for Shanghai in achieving a substantial increase in steel production this year. As early as May, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China led leading cadres at all levels of factories to examine their work in the spirit of rectification, earnestly change their work style, and go deep into the front line of production, making the relationship between leaders and the masses closer. Steel enterprises throughout the city, from factories and workshops to work sections and groups, strengthened the unified leadership of the Party from top to bottom, especially strengthening the work of grassroots Party branches, mobilizing the masses in depth according to furnace seats and specialties, thereby inspiring the enthusiasm of the masses and raising the awareness of the masses. Competitions were very heated between large steel enterprises, between small steel enterprises, between workshops, between furnace seats, and between groups throughout the city, and a large number of advanced producers emerged, creating many advanced experiences.

While strengthening ideological and political work, Shanghai's steel enterprises also paid attention to the preparation of material conditions. With the strong support of all walks of life in the city, they vigorously grasped technical measures and strived to solve the specific problems that frequently arose in production, ensuring the smooth progress of production.

    钢铁职工顽强革新技术  全国各地大力支援物资
    上海钢产量大幅度增长
    全年计划提前完成，钢的质量提高，铁耗普遍降低
    新华社上海30日电　上海钢铁工业在1958、1959年连续大跃进的基础上，1960年又取得了巨大胜利，提前十七天完成了今年国家规定的钢产量计划。钢的质量也有提高，转炉钢的合格率已达到97％以上，并且消灭了三级品。铁耗也普遍降低。
    上海钢铁生产今年获得全面跃进，是全国各地尤其是华东各省坚决贯彻“全国一盘棋”的精神，以各种物资全力支援的结果。今年以来，各有关省市源源不断地给上海运来了大量的煤、铁、矿石以及炼钢需要的各种辅助材料。江苏、浙江等地的矿山为上海开采了大量的石灰石，安徽、山东、江西、江苏、福建、浙江等很多地区都集中人力、物力，加快了生铁生产和调运的速度，使上海钢产量大幅度增长得到可靠的物质保证。
    为了全面完成今年的生产计划，上海钢铁职工坚决地向各种困难展开了顽强的斗争。从今年初，他们就坚决实行化铁炉的技术改造，提高去硫效率。夏季，他们又提出了“战高温、攻高硫、夺高产”的口号，在艰苦的条件下，解决了技术上的关键问题。秋天，在这个基础上生产大幅度跃进。第四季度，在以粮钢为中心的增产节约运动中，转炉炼钢技术和生产水平有了很大发展和提高。
      “政治上炉前”，充分调动广大职工群众的主动性和积极性，解决生产上不断出现的一系列的关键问题，是今年上海实现钢产量大幅度增长的重要经验。中共上海市委早在5月就领导各厂各级领导干部以整风的精神检查了自己的工作，切实转变作风，深入生产第一线，使领导和群众的关系更加密切。全市钢铁企业从厂、车间直到工段、小组，从上到下加强了党的统一领导，特别是加强了基层的党支部工作，按炉座、按专业，深入地发动群众，因而鼓舞了群众的干劲，提高了群众的觉悟。全市各个大型钢铁企业之间、小型钢铁企业之间，车间和车间、炉座和炉座、小组和小组之间，竞赛十分热烈，涌现了大批先进生产者，创造了许多先进经验。
    在加强思想政治工作的同时，上海各钢铁企业还注意了物质条件的准备，在全市各行各业的大力支援下，大抓技术措施，努力解决生产中经常不断出现的具体问题，保证了生产顺利进行。
