Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 16th: The Indonesian *People's Daily* published an editorial today entitled "Eternal Friendship between Indonesia and China," stating that Indonesia and China signed implementation measures for the Treaty on Dual Nationality on the 15th, which will undoubtedly help resolve issues that existed between Indonesia and China in the past.

The editorial said, "From the beginning, we believed that disagreements between Asian and African countries, including those between Indonesia and China, were detrimental to Asian and African countries, especially the countries concerned. However, we have always believed from the beginning that the disagreements between Indonesia and China were only temporary."

The editorial continued, "Imperialists attempted to undermine the friendship between the two countries. However, due to the anti-imperialist struggle of the Indonesian and Chinese people, and the strong desire of the Indonesian and Chinese governments to maintain the friendship between the two countries, the imperialists have not been able to realize their attempts."

The newspaper said that, of course, not all difficulties can be resolved at once. What is important is that existing difficulties are beginning to be resolved.

The newspaper pointed out that there is a strong desire to continue to resolve difficulties. Relying on the friendly measures and desires of both sides, the sincere and eternal friendship between Indonesia and China can certainly be maintained and developed.

The *News Service* editorial on the 15th stated that the signing of the implementation measures for the Treaty on Dual Nationality between Indonesia and China has positive significance for creating a favorable atmosphere for cooperation between Indonesia and China.
