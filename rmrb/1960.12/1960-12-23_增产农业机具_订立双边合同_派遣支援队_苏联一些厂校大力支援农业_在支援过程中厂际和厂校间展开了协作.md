　　Soviet Factories and Schools Vigorously Support Agriculture
　　Collaboration Unfolds Among Factories and Schools During the Support Process

　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 22nd: Factories and schools in various regions of the Soviet Union continue to support agricultural production in a variety of ways.

　　Some Soviet factories, having fulfilled their initial pledges to produce more machinery and equipment for agricultural production by establishing "Agricultural Mechanization Funds" and "Steel Funds" through saving raw materials, funds, etc., are now proposing to produce another batch of agricultural machinery before the end of the year. Workers at the construction factory in the Krasnoyarsk Territory voluntarily manufactured 470 sets of arch-bridge cow sheds for collective farms and state farms this year. They now propose to manufacture dozens more of these facilities before the end of the year. The Minsk Tractor Factory guarantees to produce 40 more row-crop tractors before the end of the year using saved materials.

　　In order to make support for agriculture more meticulous and specific, some enterprises have signed bilateral contracts with rural areas and established specialized supervision organizations. For example, factories in the Vikhr-Isetsk industrial district of Sverdlovsk are taking the form of collectively helping the Tugulym agricultural district. The workers put forward the slogan "Seven-Year Plan – Our Common Cause." The First Secretary of the district committee and factory leaders went to the countryside to understand the situation, and rural leaders also came to the city. The two sides met together to study and determine "who to help, what to help with, and how much to help," and signed bilateral contracts. To lead this work, a district committee consisting of representatives from 17 factories and organizations, and four supervisory committees composed of the number of agricultural estates receiving assistance were organized.

　　Many factories have dispatched support teams to rural areas. The Krasnoyarsk Territory sent working teams composed of installation workers to Sukhobuzimsk, Mansk, and Uyarsk districts to install various equipment for livestock farms.

　　In the work of supporting rural areas, factories and factories, factories and schools also cooperate with each other. Students of Moscow Fourth ○ Technical School initially proposed to manufacture 100 machine tools for agriculture at the beginning of the year. Workers of the Tomsk Electric Factory also participated in this work. Manufacturing 100 machine tools required more than ten tons of iron. Students of the Seventh ○ Two Three Elementary School in the Stalin District helped collect most of the iron and jointly completed the guarantee.

　　Due to the specific assistance of factories and schools, the level of mechanization and electrification in rural areas has been further improved. For example, factory workers in the Stalingrad Oblast helped 50 livestock farms realize mechanization, 40 collective farms and 12 state farms realize electrification, and put five district transformer substations into production.

    增产农业机具  订立双边合同  派遣支援队
    苏联一些厂校大力支援农业
    在支援过程中厂际和厂校间展开了协作
    据新华社莫斯科22日电  苏联各地一些工厂、学校继续以多种多样的方式支援农业生产。
    有些苏联工厂在完成了年初提出的用节约原材料、资金等建立“农业机械化基金”、“钢铁基金”等办法为农业生产更多的机器设备的保证以后，现在又提出要在年底之前再多生产一批农业机具。克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区的建筑工厂的工人今年自愿为集体农庄和国营农场制造了四百七十套虹桥式牛栏，他们现在提出到年底之前还要制造出数十套这种设备。明斯克拖拉机工厂保证用节约的材料年底之前多生产四十台中耕拖拉机。
    为了使得对农业的支援变得更加细致而具体，有些企业同农村订立了双边合同，成立专门的监督组织。如斯维德洛夫城的维赫尔—伊塞茨克工业区的工厂采取集体帮助图古雷姆农业区的形式。工人们提出了“七年计划——我们共同事业”的口号。这个区的区委第一书记和工厂领导人去农村了解情况，农村的领导人也到城里来，双方在一起开会，研究和确定了“帮助谁、帮助什么、帮助多少”，并签订了双边合同。为领导这一工作，还组织了包括十七个工厂、组织代表参加的区委员会和接受援助的农庄数目组成了四个监督委员会。
    许多工厂向农村派出了支援队。克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区向苏哈布兹姆斯克、曼斯克和乌雅尔斯克区派出了由安装工人组成的工作队，为各畜牧场安装各种设备。
    在支援农村的工作中，工厂和工厂、工厂和学校也互相协作。莫斯科第四○工艺学校的学生年初提出要为农业制造一百台机床，托木斯克电器工厂的工人也参加了这一工作，制造一百台机床需要十多吨铁，斯大林区第七二三小学的学生们帮助收集了绝大部分的铁，共同完成了保证。
    由于工厂和学校的具体帮助，农村中机械化、电气化水平进一步提高了。如斯大林格勒州工厂工人帮助五十个畜牧场实现了机械化、四十个集体农庄和十二个国营农场实现了电气化，使五个区变电所投入了生产。
