Having Traversed Countless Green Mountains, One Remains Young
Luo Mu Fa

Human life progresses from youth to strength, and from strength to old age; this is an immutable law of nature. However, the revolutionary will and revolutionary spirit of proletarian revolutionary fighters are eternally young and never age. The story of Communist Party member and veteran Red Army soldier, Major General Gan Zuchang, resigning from his post and returning to his hometown to engage in agriculture, is a vivid example.

General Gan Zuchang fought north and south for thirty years, climbing snowy mountains and crossing grasslands. He was wounded in the head several times in the hail of bullets, eventually making it impossible to continue his work due to severe brain damage. In 1957, he resolutely gave up his convalescence and firmly returned to his hometown to participate in agricultural production labor. In more than three years of production labor, he displayed the same revolutionary vigor as when he bravely fought the enemy, hacking through thorns, braving wind and rain, and engaging in a tenacious struggle with nature. He transformed the red soil and the winter paddy fields, bringing a bumper harvest to his hometown's agricultural production.

Proletarian revolutionary fighters are engaged in the great revolutionary cause of realizing the most beautiful communist society on Earth and completely liberating all of mankind. In our country, this means completely changing the "poor and blank" situation and building a strong socialist country with modern industry, agriculture, science, and culture. This is naturally not an easy task, nor can it be obtained without effort. The Party teaches each of our revolutionary fighters to have the determination to engage in revolution for a lifetime and the perseverance to dedicate a lifetime of energy. Wherever the Party needs him, he goes; whatever he can do, he contributes to the Party, wholeheartedly for the revolution, consistently as if every day is the first. As long as it is beneficial to the revolution, as long as it is part of the revolutionary cause, he regards it as a great joy and a great honor, bravely, happily, and persistently undertaking it, diligently and conscientiously, without any consideration of personal gain or loss, and without any selfish motives. Such a revolutionary fighter will have an eternally strong revolutionary will, an eternally full revolutionary spirit, and eternally vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm, and his life will be forever full of youthful vitality. General Gan Zuchang said it well: "As long as my heart is still beating, I will contribute my strength, even a little bit, to building a happy new countryside." General Gan Zuchang fully maintains the true colors of a veteran Red Army soldier, maintaining the youth of revolutionary fighting spirit!

"Having traversed countless green mountains, one remains young; the scenery is especially good here!" Many of our revolutionary predecessors, having endured countless hardships and overcome numerous difficulties, never felt old due to their arduous journeys despite having traversed countless green mountains. Although their hair is already white, they are always so energetic and vigorous in their old age. This is because they all possess a high degree of revolutionary optimism and are filled with an unshakeable belief in the great cause they are engaged in. At any time and under any circumstances, they feel that our "scenery" is the best, and that the "landscape" of our socialist and communist cause is the most enchanting!

    踏遍青山人未老
    罗木法
    人的生命，由幼而壮，由壮而老，这是不可改变的自然法则。然而，无产阶级革命战士的革命意志和革命精神，则是永远年青不老的。共产党员、红军老战士甘祖昌少将解甲归田、以农为业的事迹，就是一个生动的例证。
    甘祖昌将军南征北战三十年，爬雪山，过草地，在枪林弹雨中，头部数次负伤，终因脑子受到严重损害不能坚持工作。1957年，他毅然放弃了疗养生活，坚决地回到故乡参加农业生产劳动。在三年多的生产劳动中，他又发挥了当年英勇杀敌的革命干劲，披荆斩棘，栉风沐雨，和自然界进行顽强的斗争，改造了红土壤，改造了冬水田，使故乡的农业生产获得了丰收。
    无产阶级的革命战士，干的是伟大的革命事业，要在地球上实现最美好的共产主义社会，彻底解放全人类；在我们国家来说，就是要彻底改变“一穷二白”的状况，建设一个具有现代化工业、农业、科学文化的社会主义强国。这自然绝不是轻而易举、唾手可得的。党教导我们每个革命战士，要有干一辈子革命的决心和付出毕生精力的毅力。党需要他在哪里，他就到哪里，他能干什么，就向党贡献什么，一心为革命，终生如一日；只要对革命有利的事情，只要是革命事业的一部分，他都看作是极大的乐事，极大的光荣，勇敢地、愉快地、坚持不懈地去担负它，勤勤恳恳，兢兢业业，毫无得失之计，毫无自私之心。这样的革命战士，革命意志永远是坚强的，革命精神永远是饱满的，革命情绪永远是旺盛的，他的生命也就永远充满着青春的活力。甘祖昌将军说得好：“只要我的心脏还能跳动，我有一分热，发一分光，一定为建设一个幸福的新农村贡献自己的力量。”甘祖昌将军完全保持着老红军的本色，保持着革命斗志的青春！
    “踏遍青山人未老，风景这边独好！”我们许多的革命前辈，他们历尽千辛万苦，越过重重困难，尽管是踏遍青山万重，却从不因风尘跋涉而感到衰老；尽管是已经白发苍苍，却永远是那样朝气勃勃，老当益壮。这是因为他们都具有高度的革命乐观主义精神，对自己从事的伟大事业充满着必胜的信念，在任何时候、任何情况下，他们都感到我们的“风景”是最好的，我们的社会主义、共产主义事业的“景色”是最迷人的！
