    Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch: Tokyo—The Japan Peace Congress closed in Tokyo this afternoon. The congress, which lasted three days, unanimously adopted a policy for the peace movement, stipulating that it will make every effort to launch a struggle to crush the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." In the future, it will vigorously promote all struggles based on the achievements of the struggle against the new "Security Treaty."
    The congress also passed a series of resolutions, including a strong protest against the interference in the internal affairs of the Congo, Cuba, and Laos by imperialists headed by the United States.
    The movement policy adopted by the congress stipulates that the current goals of the struggle are: to withdraw U.S. military bases from Japan; to withdraw U.S. troops from Japan; to recover Okinawa occupied by the U.S. military; to stop the expansion of the Japanese army and nuclear armament; to prevent new islands from becoming missile bases; to strive for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China; to conclude a Japan-Soviet peace treaty; and to stop the Japanese government's talks with the South Korean puppet clique.
    The policy also stipulates that various rallies and signature campaigns will be held across the country from the end of January to the end of February next year to commemorate the Japanese fishermen who died from the harm caused by U.S. hydrogen bomb tests on Bikini Atoll in the Pacific. At the same time, efforts will be made to ensure the victory of the Seventh World Congress for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament.
    The congress passed the congress declaration in warm applause. The declaration called on the Japanese people to strengthen the struggle against the revival of Japanese militarism and to strive for Japan's neutrality. The declaration pointed out that this is the current task of the Japanese people.
    The congress also passed a resolution demanding that the Japanese government stop expanding its army, reduce military spending, change its hostile policy towards China, and support the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations.
    In another resolution, the congress expressed its support for the initiative of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the peaceful reunification of Korea and firmly opposed the Japanese government's talks with the South Korean puppet clique.
    In a resolution on Okinawa, the congress strongly opposed the joint missile test scheduled to be held in Okinawa next January by the United States, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique.
