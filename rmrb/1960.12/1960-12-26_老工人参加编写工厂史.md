    Old Workers Participate in Writing Factory History
    Workers at the "Pneumatic Tool" Factory in Leningrad are collectively creating a factory history, recording the birth and development of this factory that manufactures mining equipment for the coal industry.
    Ivanov, an old assembler who has worked at the factory for nearly fifty years, has already written a chapter describing the nationalization of this enterprise, which originally belonged to American capitalists. In this chapter, he mentioned that at the time, the American boss threatened the workers with the argument that if they left, Russia would never be able to produce pneumatic tools again. However, the workers of Leningrad quickly shattered the American capitalist's delusions with their actions.
    Chief Engineer Zeletsky, who started as a fitter, also participated in the writing of the factory history. He used facts to outline the factory's present, showing readers the highly developed technical level of the "Pneumatic Tool" Factory.

    老工人参加编写工厂史
    列宁格勒“风动工具”工厂的工人们正在集体创作工厂史，纪录这一为煤炭工业制造开采设备的工厂的诞生和发展。
    在这工厂工作了近五十年的老装配工人依凡诺夫已经写成了记述将这家原来属于美国资本家的企业进行国有化的一章。他在这一章里提到，当时，美国老板曾经以离开了他们俄罗斯就将永远不能再生产风动工具的论调来威胁工人们，可是列宁格勒的工人们很快就用行动粉碎了美国资本家的妄言。
    钳工出身的总工程师泽列?茨基也参加了工厂史的写作，他用事实勾划了工厂的今天，向读者展示了“风动工具”工厂的高度发展的技术水平。
