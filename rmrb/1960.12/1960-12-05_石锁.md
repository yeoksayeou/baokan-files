Revolutionary Relic

    Stone Weight

    This is a stone weight weighing 73 jin (approximately 88 pounds), on display in the Second Revolutionary Civil War Hall of the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution.

    In the years before 1929, during frequent wars and extremely difficult circumstances, Marshal He Long often used it to exercise, which fully demonstrates that the people's army is not only a heroic and skilled fighting force, but has also always attached great importance to cultural and sports activities. Our army has always been a revolutionary army with cultural qualities.

    石锁
    这是一个重七十三斤的石锁，陈列在革命军事博物馆第二次国内革命战争馆内。
    在1929年以前，战争频繁，环境极端困难的岁月里，贺龙元帅常用它来锻炼身体，这充分说明人民军队不仅是英勇善战的英雄，而且历来都非常重视文化体育活动的。我们的军队从来就是一支有文化素养的革命军队。
