Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing Electric Dispatch: The May 1st Production Brigade of the Chengjiang People's Commune in the suburbs of Chongqing has adopted various measures to protect the female labor force and give full play to the role of women's labor. The attendance rate of the entire brigade's female labor force has remained above 95% for a long time.

Based on the physiological characteristics of women, the brigade has established three regulations for women participating in agricultural labor: women should not engage in water work during menstruation; women should not engage in heavy work during pregnancy; and women should not engage in work far from home during breastfeeding. All twelve production teams in the brigade have established women's labor protection stations, with items such as women's menstrual periods, pregnancy periods, and breastfeeding periods noted. When individual women have special circumstances, they turn over their nameplates in one of the items on the station, and the production captain adjusts work assignments based on these situations. In addition, women who are more than eight months pregnant are transferred from field labor and assigned to the brigade's labor delivery center to rest and do some light manual work, such as making shoes, sewing clothes, and making straw hats and sandals, and are given maternity leave. Necessary care is also given to women with many children or gynecological diseases. After these measures were taken, not only were there no cases of gynecological diseases caused by poor labor protection, but thirty-four women who had suffered from gynecological diseases for a long time were cured with the care of the production team. He Shunbi, who had suffered from uterine prolapse for more than ten years, used to be frequently absent from work. The brigade's Party branch took the initiative to send her to the commune hospital for treatment, and her illness was cured. She is now a high-efficiency red flag bearer for the brigade. The brigade also took measures such as short field training, technical seminars, old farmers mentoring apprentices, and promotion of new agricultural tools to quickly improve women's technical level and reduce labor intensity. During the autumn planting season, many women used seed drills, which increased work efficiency by more than one time compared to manual labor. This year, the labor quotas completed by general women in the brigade each month have increased from about 150 work points in the past to more than 230 work points.

The fundamental reason why this production brigade can adhere to and implement the labor protection policy for women for a long time is that every cadre in the brigade recognizes the importance of caring for people everywhere and fully mobilizing women's labor enthusiasm, has established a set of systems, and has assigned special personnel to manage it. In addition to the brigade Party branch secretary personally taking charge, a branch committee member is also assigned to take charge of this work. All twelve production teams in the brigade are equipped with women's team leaders, and the branch regularly studies women's labor protection issues. In this way, labor protection for women is closely monitored and resolutely implemented at every step. For example, at the beginning of September, the brigade arranged for winter labor protection work for women. In addition to paying attention to women's winter hygiene, they also took into account the fact that women need to do housework such as making shoes and mending clothes in winter. Therefore, after the "Four Autumns," based on the relatively idle production situation, women were given more time than usual each day to handle housework. Sewing groups, shoemaking groups, etc. were organized, and more than 350 sets of clothes and 310 pairs of shoes have now been made, helping more than 100 women with fewer hands to solve the difficulties of sewing and making shoes.

    关心妇女健康　保护妇女劳力
    五一大队妇女积极参加生产出勤率经常达95％
    据新华社重庆电　重庆市郊澄江人民公社五一生产大队采取各种措施保护妇女劳动力，充分发挥了妇女劳动力的作用，全队妇女劳力出勤率长期保持在95％以上。
    根据妇女的生理特点，这个大队对参加农业劳动的妇女规定了三条制度：即妇女经期不作水活；孕期不作重活；喂奶期不作远活。全大队的十二个生产小队都建立了妇女劳动保护台，上面注明了妇女经期、孕期、喂奶期等项目，各个妇女有特殊情况就在台上的某一项目中翻开自己的名牌，生产队长根据这些情况调工。另外，凡怀孕八个月以上的妇女就调离田间劳动，分配到大队的劳动产院去一面休息，一面做些手工轻活，如做鞋、缝衣、打草帽、草鞋等，并坚持放产假。对子女多的和有妇女病的妇女，还在生活上给以必要的照顾。采取这些措施后，不仅没有发生因劳动保护不好而造成妇科病的情况，而且还使三十四个长期患有妇科病的妇女在生产队的照顾下治好了病。患了十多年子宫脱垂病的贺顺碧，过去经常缺勤。大队党支部主动送她到公社医院去治疗，把她的病治好了。她现在成了大队的高工效红旗手。大队还采取田间短训、技术座谈、老农带徒弟和推广新式农具等措施，迅速提高妇女的技术水平，减轻劳动强度。在秋种中，许多妇女使用播种耧，比手工提高工效一倍以上。今年全大队一般妇女每月完成的劳动定额都由过去的一百五十个工分左右，增加为二百三十个工分以上。
    这个生产大队能够长期坚持贯彻对妇女的劳动保护政策，根本原因是由于全大队每个干部都认识到处处关心人和充分调动妇女劳动积极性的重要意义，建立了一套制度，还有专人来管。除大队党支部书记亲自抓以外，还派了一个支委专管这一工作。全大队的十二个生产小队都配了妇女队长，支部定期专门研究妇女劳动保护问题。这样，对妇女劳动保护就做到步步抓紧，坚决执行。例如，在9月初，这个大队就安排了冬季的妇女劳动保护的工作。除了注意妇女的冬季卫生外，还照顾到妇女需要在冬季做鞋、缝补衣服等家务劳动。于是在“四秋”结束后，就根据生产较闲的情况，每天让妇女有比平常较多的时间处理家务事。并组织了缝衣组、做鞋组等，现已做了三百五十多套衣服和三百一十多双鞋子，帮助一百多个人手少的妇女解决了缝衣、做鞋的困难。
