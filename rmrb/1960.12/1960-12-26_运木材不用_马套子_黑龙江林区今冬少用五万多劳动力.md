Lumber Transport without "Horse Harnesses"
Heilongjiang Forest Area Reduces Labor Force by Over 50,000 This Winter

(Our newspaper, Harbin, 25th) This winter, most forest areas in Heilongjiang Province have begun using mechanized and semi-mechanized transportation tools created during the technical innovation movement to transport lumber, basically eliminating the "horse harnesses" that have been used for winter lumber transport for many years. This has freed up more than 54,000 strong laborers and more than 65,000 strong horses from rural areas to be put into winter production.

In previous years, lumber transport in the Heilongjiang forest areas during the winter relied on "horse harnesses," requiring the mobilization of a large number of laborers and livestock from rural areas to enter the mountains to transport lumber each year. This year, forest area workers have been vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, creating dozens of types of machinery and more than 2,000 pieces of equipment. The "hand-pushed cart" created by the Bayi Forest Farm of the Suileng Forestry Bureau can transport wood on snow using a single wooden rail. This "hand-pushed cart" is easy to move and simple to manufacture, and has been widely promoted throughout the forest areas of the province. Forest area workers have also followed the principle of "adapting to the weather and adapting to the terrain," piling up snow to form troughs, pouring river water on them to freeze into ice, and using the mountain slopes to slide the wood downhill. The Yong'an Forest Farm of the Dahai Forestry Bureau in the Mudanjiang forest area uses this ice and snow channel to transport lumber, with an efficiency 92% higher and a cost 73% lower than animal power. At present, more than 6,000 kilometers of ice and snow slides have been built throughout the province, covering all mountain areas.

    运木材不用“马套子”
    黑龙江林区今冬少用五万多劳动力
    本报哈尔滨25日电　黑龙江省大部分林区今年冬季搬运木材，都用上了在技术革新运动中创造的机械化、半机械化运输工具，基本上消灭了多年来冬季搬运木材用的“马套子”。这样就为农村节约出五万四千多名强壮劳动力和六万五千多匹壮马，投入冬季生产。
    黑龙江省林区往年冬季搬运木材，一向依靠“马套子”，每年都要由农村动员大批劳动力和牲畜进山搬运木材。今年林区职工大搞技术革新和技术革命，创造出数十种机具、二千余件。绥棱林业局八一林场创造的“手扶车”，利用单根木轨就能在雪地上运木头。这种“手扶车”挪动方便，制做简单，全省林区已经普遍推广。林区职工还本着“适天时，适地利”的原则，把积雪砌成槽，浇上河水冻成冰，借山形坡度往下滑运木头。牡丹江林区的大海林业局永安林场，用这种冰雪槽道运木材，效率比畜力高92％，成本低73％。目前全省已修冰雪滑道六千多公里，布满林区各个山场。
