    "Old Whip Hand" and "Little Ox Handler"
    Xinhua News Agency reporter
    In the Shangying Production Team of the Shezhen Commune in Nanyang City, Henan Province, the story of "Old Whip Hand and Little Ox Handler" is widely circulated.
    "Old Whip Hand" is named Du Guangyin, an old model livestock breeder, who is fifty-two years old this year. Since he was a child, he farmed and fed livestock for the landlords, enduring all kinds of hardships. After liberation, he turned over and became a feeder in the agricultural cooperative and the people's commune. He has been feeding cattle for thirty-four years. Because he is honest and kind, and has good skills in managing livestock, everyone respectfully calls him "Old Whip Hand." His son, Du Baoyuan, is twenty-one years old this year. After graduating from junior high school in 1956, he followed his father to learn how to feed and use cattle in the commune. Because Baoyuan is smart and hardworking, he has learned a good set of farming skills in the past four years, and he is also good at managing livestock, so the commune members gave him the nickname "Little Ox Handler." The story revolves around this father and son.
    Old Whip Hand Teaches His Son the Craft
    When Baoyuan graduated from junior high school, he wanted to continue his studies, wanted to be a worker, and also wanted to be a cadre, but he never thought about farming. Baoyuan's mother also advocated that her son go out and find something to do. Du Guangyin thought differently from them. He said, "Agriculture is fundamental. No matter what you do, you have to eat grain. I think Baoyuan should engage in agriculture in the countryside." In this way, Du Baoyuan stayed at home, but his heart did not settle down.
    Once, Du Guangyin went to plow the old Longyaowa land in the Northwest Ridge and asked Baoyuan to follow him to check the wheat around the ridge. When they arrived, they saw that the past barren ridge had become a golden ocean. The old man said happily to Baoyuan, "This ridge has always yielded only a little bit for so many years. Now the barren ridge has also changed its appearance. It is true that the strength of the people is great." He also said, "I heard that the higher-level Party committee has called for more wells to be dug, more canals to be opened, grain production to be increased, and industry to be supported. When industrial construction is good, not only will machines be used for farming, but machines will also be used for transporting crops and threshing. Our countryside will also have factories in the future. Who would have thought that the villagers who have suffered for generations would have such a thing?" The old man continued, "I think it is right for you to stay at home and engage in agriculture. Everyone has to eat. Going to school and working in factories cannot be done on an empty stomach!"
    His father's words made Baoyuan's heart beat violently. He recalled the Party's teachings and the teacher's words when he was in school: "Go to where the motherland needs you!" "Ambitious young people should become the first generation of new-type farmers with culture in the motherland!" From then on, he secretly made up his mind to listen to the Party, inherit his father's career, concentrate on farming, and not think wildly anymore.
    Du Baoyuan happily threw himself into agricultural production. In the fields of the Shangying Brigade, people could often see an elderly farmer, holding a plow in one hand and pointing with a whip in the other; a young man closely following behind the plow, concentrating on watching the plowshare. This was "Old Whip Hand" teaching his son how to plow the land.
    The Revival of "Red Horn"
    One summer day in 1959, Du Guangyin and Baoyuan were pulling manure carts through the village when they met the members of the Second Team leading their team's famous cow, "Red Horn," towards the street. Du Guangyin asked and learned that the cow had been sick for more than a month. The veterinarian had seen it several times, but it didn't get better. The team decided to take it to the street and ask the tax office for permission to slaughter it. Du Guangyin carefully looked at "Red Horn" and figured that the sick cow could be nursed back to health if it was fed well. They immediately went to the captain to discuss and suggested that the team exchange "Red Horn" for a calf they were raising.
    Since "Red Horn" was brought back, the father and son have been even busier. In the hot weather, Du Guangyin was unwilling to leave the cowshed and often stayed with "Red Horn," carefully observing its condition. Baoyuan helped his father chop the grass very finely, rinsed it very cleanly, often collected dishwater, and constantly went to other villages to ask veterinarians for help.
    However, "Red Horn's" illness did not improve, and it didn't even want to eat grass. This worried Du Guangyin and his son! One day, Du Guangyin soaked a basin of mung bean water, and "Red Horn" drank it all in one breath. Looking at the empty basin, Du Guangyin's mind suddenly opened. He thought: Is this cow's illness caused by a lack of water? The next day at noon, he ran to the Second Team's feeding room in the scorching sun and found that there was very little water in the water tank. It turned out that the Second Team lacked water, and the cow's drinking water conditions were poor. "Old Whip Hand" visited the members of the Second Team and confirmed his judgment. After that, he paid special attention to giving "Red Horn" water, in addition to soaking mung bean water, he also soaked some salt water to help stimulate its appetite.
    "Red Horn's" illness became lighter day by day, and it slowly regained its fatness. The father and son were very happy and took even more careful and thoughtful care of it. By the time it was time to plant wheat, the cow had grown strong and healthy, and was praised by the commune members. Under his father's influence, Baoyuan became even more passionate about feeding cattle.
      Father and Son, Double Models
    This year is Du Baoyuan's fifth year of learning to feed cattle with his father. He has already learned a set of cattle-feeding techniques. The cattle raised by the father and son are truly shiny and smooth, as strong as happy tigers, and everyone praises them. Du Guangyin couldn't help but laugh when he heard people call his son "Little Ox Handler."
    The production team's cattle gradually increased, and the team saw that Baoyuan's cattle-feeding skills were good, so they decided to add two more, divided into two troughs, one for each of the father and son.
    After the separate trough feeding, both of them became even busier. The cowshed, the cattle bed, the cattle trough, and the feed tank were all cleaned up neatly and tidily. Du Guangyin often went to see how his son's trough of cattle was being fed, and pointed out any inadequacies. Baoyuan also often helped his father pull cattle, chop grass, and carry water, and introduced his father to the good experiences in the newspapers. The two cared for each other, helped each other, and also launched a competition. In the past year, the six adult cattle raised by the father and son were not only full of fat and strong, with a high attendance rate, but also added four calves. The father and son were both praised by the masses as models. Everyone praised them, saying "Like father, like son."
    In the Vast World
    Du Baoyuan gradually grew up in production labor. In addition to feeding cattle, he also learned general field labor techniques and became a "busy person" in the countryside. You can't really figure out how many things he does: the masses ask him to read letters and write letters for them; calculate work points, read newspapers, and publish blackboards; in the evening, the people's school teacher also asks him for help. While working, he also conducts scientific and technological experiments. He referred to advanced experiences from other places and made a "five-spice feed" for cattle. Livestock love to eat it, it is easy to make, and it saves the team more than 300 catties of refined feed a month. The most interesting thing is the "small farm" he manages. This small farm has an area of only three cents, but there are really many things planted inside, including multi-eared corn, tomatoes, potatoes, as well as fragrant pears, foreign apples, and other fruit trees introduced from other places. In addition, he also raised seven boxes of bees and twelve rabbits for the team... In order to encourage young people to study agricultural science and technology, the brigade Party branch specially organized a research group, determined that Baoyuan would be the leader of the group, and this made him even more motivated. Now, they have learned many fruit tree grafting techniques, learned how to graft moonflowers and sweet potatoes, and learned many methods to prevent and control diseases and insect pests of radishes and cabbage.
    Under Baoyuan's influence, some junior high school graduates in the village who were originally not content with agricultural production have also settled down. Now some have become work recorders, some have become cotton managers, and some have become accountants for the team. Du Baoyuan's mother, who was originally dissatisfied with letting her children participate in agricultural production, now praises her children for being capable with a smile.

    “老掌鞭”和“小牛把”
    新华社记者
    在河南省南阳市赊镇公社尚营生产队里，广泛流传着“老掌鞭和小牛把”的故事。
    “老掌鞭”名叫杜广银，是个老饲养模范，今年五十二岁了。他从小就给地主家种地喂牲口，吃尽了苦头。解放后翻了身，当了农业社和人民公社的饲养员，算起来他喂牛已有三十四年的历史了。因为他为人忠厚老实，又有一手使牲口的好技术，大家都尊称他为“老掌鞭”。他的儿子杜宝元，今年二十一岁，1956年高小毕业后，就在社里跟着他学喂牛使牛。因为宝元聪明肯干，四年来学会了一手好庄稼活，使牲口也是好样的，所以社员们就给他送个外号叫
  “小牛把”。故事就出在他们父子俩的身上。
    老掌鞭教子学艺
    宝元在高小毕业的时候，曾想继续上学，想当工人，又想当干部，可就是没有想到务农的事。宝元的母亲也主张儿子到外边去找个事干。杜广银和他们想的不一样，他说：“农业是根本，不论干哪一行都得吃粮食，我看宝元就在农村干农业吧。”就这样，杜宝元留在家里了，可是他的心并没有安定下来。
    有一次，杜广银去犁西北岗的老龙腰洼地，就叫宝元跟着去看看岗子四周的小麦。一到那里，只见过去的荒岗早已变成了一片金色的海洋，老汉乐呵呵地对宝元说：“这岗子多少年来都是种一葫芦打两瓢，现在荒岗也变了样子，真是人多力量大。”他又说：“听说上级党委又号召多打井，多开渠，增产粮食，支援工业。工业建设好了，不光种地用机器，就是运庄稼、打场也要使用机器了。咱乡下将来也要办工厂，咱这祖祖辈辈受苦的乡下人，谁能想到有这样的事呢？”老汉接着说：“我看，你留在家里干农业就是正事。人人都要吃饭嘛，进学校、干工厂，也不能饿着肚读书、开机器呀！”
    父亲的谈话，使宝元的心激烈地跳动着。他回想起了在校时党的教导和老师的话：“到祖国需要的地方去！”“有志青年要当祖国第一代有文化的新型农民！”从此他暗暗下定了决心，一定要听党的话，继承父亲的事业，专心务农，再不胡思乱想了。
    杜宝元愉快地投入了农业生产。在尚营大队的田野上，人们经常可以看到一个老年农民，一手扶犁，一手用鞭子指指点点；犁后边紧跟着一个青年，聚精会神地看着犁头。这就是“老掌鞭”在教儿子学犁地。
    “红尖角”的复活
    1959年夏季的一天，杜广银和宝元正使车拉粪从村里过，迎面碰见二队社员牵着他们队里有名的母牛“红尖角”往街上走。杜广银一问，才知道这头牛已经病了一个多月，兽医看过几次也不见轻，队里决定把它拉到街上，请税务所批准宰杀。杜广银仔细打量着“红尖角”，捉摸这病牛只要好好喂，还能养过来。他们立即去找队长商量，建议队里用自己喂的一头小牛娃去把“红尖角”调换下来。
    自从“红尖角”牵回来以后，父子俩更加忙碌了。大热天，杜广银也不肯离开牛棚，经常守着“红尖角”，细心地观察病情。宝元帮助父亲把草铡得又细又碎，淘的干干净净，经常收集刷锅水，还不断到外村去请兽医。
    可是“红尖角”的病还是不见轻，甚至连草也不想吃了。这可把杜广银父子急坏啦！一天，杜广银泡了一盆绿豆水，“红尖角”一口气就喝光了。杜广银看着空盆子，心窍忽然开了。他想：这牛的病是不是生在缺水上？第二天晌午，他顶着火辣辣的太阳跑到二队的饲养室去，发现水缸里的水很少，原来二队缺水，牛的饮水条件差。“老掌鞭”访问了二队社员，证实了自己的判断。以后他就特别注意给“红尖角”饮水，除了泡绿豆水，还泡些盐水帮助开胃口。
    “红尖角”的病一天比一天轻了，慢慢恢复了膘情，父子俩心里十分高兴，喂养得更加细心周到。到了种麦时候，牛已经长得肥健有力，受到社员的称赞。宝元在父亲的影响下，更加热爱了喂牛工作。
      父子双模范
    今年已经是杜宝元跟父亲学喂牛的第五个年头。他已经学会了一套喂牛技术。爷儿俩喂的一槽牛，真是油光水滑，壮如欢虎，谁见谁夸奖。杜广银听到人们称他儿子“小牛把”，不禁乐呵呵地笑了起来。
    生产队的牛渐渐多起来，队里见宝元喂牛技术不错，就决定再添两头分成两槽，由他爷儿俩各喂一槽。
    分槽喂养以后，两个人都更忙碌起来，牛屋、牛铺、牛槽、料缸都收拾得干干净净、整整齐齐。杜广银常去看儿子喂的一槽牛怎样，有不妥地方就指点指点；宝元也经常帮父亲拉牛、铡草、担水，给父亲介绍报纸上的好经验，两个人互相关心，互相帮助，还开展了竞赛。近一年来，父子俩喂的六头大牛不仅膘满肥壮，出勤率高，而且又添了四个小牛犊。父子俩都被群众评成模范。大家一谈起来，都称赞他们“老子英雄儿好汉”。
    在广阔的天地里
    杜宝元在生产劳动中逐渐成长起来。他除了喂牛，还学会了一般田间劳动技术，而且成了农村的“忙人”。你真摸不清他有多少事：群众找他念信和代写书信；算工分、读报、出黑板报；晚上，民校老师还要请他帮忙。他一边劳动，一边还进行科学技术试验。他参考外地先进经验，制成了一种喂牛的“五香料”，牲口爱吃、制作容易，一个月就给队里节约精料三百多斤。最有趣的要算他经管的“小农场”了。这个小农场面积只有三分地，里边种的东西可真不少，有多穗玉米、西红柿、马铃薯，还有从外地引进的香蕉梨、洋苹果和其他果树。另外，他还给队里养了七箱蜜蜂，十二只兔子……。大队党支部为了鼓励青年钻研农业科学技术，特地组织了一个研究小组，确定由宝元当小组长，这一来，他的干劲更足了。现在，他们已经学会了不少果树嫁接技术，学会了月光花和红薯嫁接，以及防治萝卜、白菜病虫害的许多方法。
    在宝元的影响下，村里有些原来不安心农业生产的高小毕业生，也都安下心来。现在有的已经当了记工员，有的当了棉花管理员，也有的当了队里的会计。本来不满意让孩子参加农业生产的杜宝元的母亲，现在也笑嘻嘻地夸奖自己的孩子能干了。
