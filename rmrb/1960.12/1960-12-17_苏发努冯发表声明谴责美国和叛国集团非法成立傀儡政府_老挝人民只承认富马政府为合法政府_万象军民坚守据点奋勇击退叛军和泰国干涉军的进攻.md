Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 16th - The Pathet Lao Radio broadcasted on the evening of the 15th that Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, issued a statement reaffirming the Lao Patriotic Front's firm support for the Phouma government, the only legitimate government of Laos, and strongly opposing the illegal actions of U.S. imperialism and the Vong—Phoumi traitorous clique in establishing a puppet government in Savannakhet. The statement said that the Lao Patriotic Front and the Lao people are determined to smash all the traitorous actions of this puppet organization.

The statement also called on all countries that have recognized the legitimate government of Laos, as well as peace-loving people and people with a sense of justice worldwide, to oppose and denounce the activities of U.S. imperialism, Thailand, and South Vietnam and other reactionaries in interfering in Laos and establishing a puppet government in Laos.

The statement emphasized that in the eyes of the Lao people and peace-loving people all over the world, Prince Souvanna Phouma's government is not only the only legitimate government of Laos, but also a government that meets the demands and aspirations of the people and enjoys the enthusiastic support of the Lao people and people all over the world.

The statement pointed out that the government fabricated by U.S. imperialism and the Vong—Phoumi traitorous clique in Savannakhet is illegal and violates the wishes of the Lao people. This government is a puppet organization deliberately fabricated by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs under pressure and coercion on some members of parliament.

The statement stated that the Lao Patriotic Front and the entire Lao people only recognize the only legitimate government of the Kingdom of Laos - the Prince Souvanna Phouma government, resolutely support the Phouma government's policy of peaceful neutrality and national harmony, and resolutely fight to defend the government and the capital Vientiane.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 16th - According to a broadcast from the Pathet Lao Radio this morning, as of the morning of the 15th, the Lao capital Vientiane was still in fierce fighting. Captain Kong Le's troops are still holding their positions and have repelled enemy attacks many times.

The troops of the Phoumi Nosavan-Vong Nachampassak group, under the command of U.S. officers, launched several attacks in coordination with the troops of the Thai reactionary group that landed in Vientiane, but they were met with fierce counterattacks by the military and civilians of Vientiane.

At 14:00 on the 14th, two of the six gunboats from Thailand were sunk by the government forces, and the rest fled back to Thailand. The traitorous clique used artillery to bombard Vientiane wildly, injuring many residents. The radio said that the people of Vientiane were very indignant at the criminal actions of the traitorous clique, and they were vigorously helping the government forces to resolutely fight against the traitorous clique and defend the capital Vientiane.

According to a report by the Vietnam News Agency today, the government army and people's armed forces defending Vientiane, under the command of Captain Kong Le, bravely fought fiercely with the Phoumi Nosavan rebels all day on the 15th. Many young people living in Vientiane also joined Kong Le's troops to fight the rebels.

The government army and people's armed forces had repelled a force from Thailand and sunk an armored speedboat of the attacking force.

The news said that in the fierce fighting, many positions changed hands several times.

Thai officers and soldiers continue to cross the Mekong River to reinforce the Phoumi traitorous clique's troops in Vientiane. U.S. imperialism and its running dogs are using silent guns from the embassies of the United States, Thailand, and South Vietnam to shoot at the defenders of Vientiane.

Vietnam News Agency quoted a foreign source as saying that a U.S. military delegation and a Thai general have arrived in Nong Khai to jointly direct the attack on Vientiane with the Lao traitorous clique.

    另据越南通讯社今天报道，保卫万象的政府军和人民武装部队，在贡勒大尉指挥下，15日整天英勇地同富米·诺萨万叛乱分子进行激战。住在万象的许多青年也参加了贡勒的部队同叛乱分子进行战斗。
    政府军和人民武装曾经击退了来自泰国的一支部队并且击沉了进攻部队的一艘装甲汽艇。
    消息说，在激烈的斗争中，许多阵地易手数次。
    泰国军官和士兵继续越过湄公河以增援在万象的富米叛国集团军队。美帝国主义和它的走狗从美国、泰国和南越的大使馆用无声枪射击万象的保卫者。
    越南通讯社援引一则外国消息说，一个美国军事代表团和一名泰国将军已经到达廊开，以便同老挝叛国集团一起指挥对万象的攻击。
