The socialist camp countries continued to achieve new and encouraging successes in socialist and communist construction this year. As they bid farewell to the first year of the sixties, fraternal countries frequently reported good news and sang songs of triumph. The entire camp presents a magnificent picture full of hope and light.

In 1960, the industry of the socialist camp countries continued to develop rapidly and proportionally. The industrial production of the vast majority of socialist countries exceeded the original growth targets. The Soviet Union, striding forward on the road to building communism, will see its total industrial output value grow by 10% this year, exceeding the original target of 8.1%. In the past two years, the Soviet Union's total industrial output value has increased by 23%, greatly exceeding the original target of 17% for the seven-year plan. Romania's industrial development rate this year has reached the highest level in eight years.

Romania's industrial production this year is expected to grow by 15.5%, which will not only exceed the past average growth level but also exceed the original target of 14% for this year. Encouraged by the slogan of "accelerating socialist construction," the Hungarian people will increase industrial production by 13% this year, almost doubling the original plan target (7%), which is also the fastest speed in the last eight years. Polish industrial workers have created the highest record of industrial development speed in five years this year. It is expected that the total industrial output value this year will increase by 10% compared to last year, instead of the original 8.6%. The industrial production of other socialist countries has also developed rapidly this year, and the production of many important industrial products will overfulfill the plan.

This year is a year in which a series of socialist countries have completed or pre-fulfilled the five-year plans or three-year plans for developing the national economy. The Korean people, riding on the "Chollima" (Thousand-Li Horse), pre-fulfilled the first five-year plan (1957-1961) one year ahead of schedule in four years. This year, the total industrial output value will increase by 2.5 times compared to 1956, 5.4 times compared to 1949 before the war, and 6.7 times compared to 1944 before liberation. Vietnam's industrial production has pre-fulfilled the three-year plan (1958-1960) ahead of schedule, with the total output value of heavy industry increasing by more than two times in three years, of which the machinery manufacturing industry increased by forty times; at the same time, the socialist transformation of handicrafts and private industrial and commercial enterprises was also basically completed this year. Mongolian industry has achieved great development during the three-year plan (1958-1960). It is estimated that the total industrial output value this year will increase by 65% compared to 1957, thus greatly exceeding the original target of 52% for the three-year plan. The Albanian people have achieved significant achievements in implementing the second five-year plan (1956-1960). Important industrial sectors such as mining, petroleum, and geological drilling will overfulfill the tasks of the five-year plan. Czechoslovakia's industry also pre-fulfilled the total output value target stipulated in the second five-year plan (1956-1960) in April this year. By the end of this year, its industrial production will increase to four times that of 1937 before liberation. The main indicators of Hungary's three-year plan (1958-1960) were pre-fulfilled one year ahead of schedule last year. This year, the plan will be fully overfulfilled. Bulgaria has already basically completed the third five-year plan (1958-1962) in this year, two years ahead of schedule. It is estimated that the total industrial output value this year will increase by 63% compared to 1957, and will surge to more than twelve times that of 1939 before liberation.

Conducting basic construction on a larger scale and at a faster speed is an important factor for the further surge in the national economy of the socialist camp countries this year. The great Soviet Union invested more in basic construction this year than in any previous year. In this year, more than one thousand large-scale projects across the country were completed and put into production. Poland has built and expanded more than one thousand large and medium-sized projects this year. Due to the concentrated use of investment, 720 projects were completed and put into production this year. Albanian construction workers carried out more than 30 basic construction projects this year, accounting for almost 60% of all projects in the entire five-year plan. The construction projects completed by Bulgaria in the first five months of this year alone were almost twice as many as in the same period last year. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has completed the basic construction tasks stipulated in the three-year plan, with a total of 124 projects above the limit being completed in the past three years. Other fraternal countries, such as the German Democratic Republic, Romania, Korea, and Mongolia, have also carried out large-scale basic construction this year.

The brilliant achievements made by the socialist countries on the industrial front this year show that the people of these countries have very high labor enthusiasm, and demonstrate their heroic spirit and creative talents in building a socialist and communist world. Over the past year, the people of the fraternal countries have widely and deeply launched various forms of labor emulation drives, doing everything possible to pre-fulfill and overfulfill production plans, to increase production and save raw materials, and to strive for technological progress and improve labor productivity. This year, Soviet industrial and agricultural workers pushed the labor emulation drive to strive for the early completion of the seven-year plan, which was launched last year, to a new stage, making the competition movement go beyond the scope of work teams, enterprises, and collective farms, and expand into competition between economic regions and between republics. The number of people participating in the "Communist Labor Brigade" competition movement has now reached nearly eight million. The "Chollima Work Team" movement in Korea has been developed more widely and comprehensively this year, and more than 320,000 people are currently participating in this movement. In other fraternal countries, socialist labor teams and other forms of competition movements are also developing vigorously, and the communist spirit of mutual help and cooperation has been greatly promoted. Helping the advanced and backward has become a new trend. All these competitions and movements have become an important force in promoting continuous development of production.

At present, based on the brilliant achievements made in 1960, the working class of socialist countries is expressing greater determination to strive for more brilliant achievements in the new year. (Attached chart)

    社会主义国家工业战线凯歌高奏喜报频传
    计划指标纷纷超过　劳动竞赛深入开展　基本建设加速进行
    社会主义阵营各国今年在社会主义和共产主义建设中，继续取得了新的令人鼓舞的成就。在送别六十年代第一年的时候，各兄弟国家喜报频传，凯歌高奏。整个阵营呈现出一幅充满希望和光明的壮丽图景。
    1960年，社会主义阵营各国的工业继续高速度按比例地向前发展。绝大多数社会主义国家的工业生产都超过了原订的增长指标。在建设共产主义的大道上阔步前进的苏联，今年工业总产值的增长率将突破原订的8.1％的指标而达到10％。最近两年来，苏联工业总产值增加了23％，大大超过了七年计划原订增加17％的指标。罗马尼亚今年工业的发展速度达到了八年以来的最高水平。
    罗马尼亚今年的工业生产预计将增长15.5％，这不但将超过过去的平均增长水平，也将超过今年原订增长14％的指标。在“加速社会主义建设”的口号的鼓舞下，匈牙利人民今年将使工业生产比去年提高13％，几乎超过原计划指标（7％）一倍，这也是最近八年以来的最快速度。波兰工业劳动者今年创造了五年以来工业发展速度的最高纪录，预计，今年工业总产值将比去年增长10％，而不是原定的8.6％。其它各社会主义国家的工业生产今年也发展得很迅速，许多重要工业产品的生产都将超额完成计划。
    今年是一系列社会主义国家完成或提前完成发展国民经济的五年计划或三年计划的一年。跨上了“千里马”的朝鲜人民以四年的时间提前一年全面完成了第一个五年计划（1957—1961年），今年工业总产值将比1956年增长二点五倍，比战前1949年增长五点四倍，比解放前1944年增长六点七倍。越南工业生产已经提前超额完成了三年计划（1958—1960年），重工业总产值在三年中增长了二倍以上，其中机器制造业增长了四十倍；与此同时，对手工业和私营工商业的社会主义改造也在今年基本完成。蒙古工业在三年计划（1958—1960年）期间取得了巨大发展，预计，今年工业总产值将比1957年增长65％，从而大大超过三年计划原订的增长52％的指标。阿尔巴尼亚人民在执行第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）中取得了重大的成就，重要工业部门如采矿、石油以及地质钻探等都将超额完成五年计划的任务。捷克斯洛伐克工业还在今年4月就提前完成了第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）所规定的总产值指标，到今年年底，它的工业生产将增长为解放前1937年的四倍。匈牙利三年计划（1958—1960年）的主要指标在去年就已提前一年完成，今年，这个计划将要全面超额完成。保加利亚已经在今年，即提前两年在基本方面完成了第三个五年计划（1958—1962年），预计，今年工业总产值将比1957年增长63％，并猛增为解放前1939年的十二倍以上。
    以更大的规模和更快的速度进行基本建设，这是今年社会主义阵营各国的国民经济获得进一步高涨的一个重要因素。伟大的苏联今年用于基本建设的投资比过去任何一年都多，在这一年中，全国共有一千多项大型工程建成并投入生产。波兰今年新建和扩建的大中型工程项目约有一千多个，由于集中使用投资，今年建成并投入生产的工程项目就达七百二十个。阿尔巴尼亚的建筑工人今年进行了三十多项基本建设工程，几乎占整个五年计划全部工程的60％。保加利亚单在今年头五个月中完成的建设项目，就比去年同时期多将近一倍。越南民主共和国已经完成了三年计划规定的基本建设任务，三年来总共建成了一百二十四项限额以上的工程。其它的兄弟国家，如德意志民主共和国、罗马尼亚、朝鲜、蒙古等，也都在今年进行了大规模的基本建设。
    社会主义国家今年在工业战线上所取得的光辉成就，表明了这些国家的人民的劳动热情十分高涨，显示了他们在建设社会主义、共产主义世界中的英雄气概和创造才能。一年来，各兄弟国家的人民广泛而深入地展开了各种形式的劳动竞赛，千方百计为提前和超额完成生产计划，为增加生产和节约原料，为争取技术进步和提高劳动生产率而斗争。今年，苏联工农业劳动者把去年掀起的争取提前完成七年计划的劳动竞赛推向了新的阶段，使竞赛运动超出了工作队之间，企业之间，集体农庄之间的范围，而扩展成为各经济区之间、共和国之间的竞赛。参加“共产主义劳动队”竞赛运动的人数目前已达将近八百万人。朝鲜的“千里马作业班”运动在今年一年中有了更为广泛、更为全面的发展，目前已有三十二万多人参加这个运动。在其它兄弟国家，社会主义劳动队和其他形式的竞赛运动也在日益蓬勃地发展，互相帮助、互相协作等共产主义精神大大发扬了，先进帮助落后已经成为一种新风气。所有这种竞赛和运动，都成为推动生产不断向前发展的重要力量。
    目前，社会主义各国的工人阶级在1960年取得的辉煌成就的基础上，正在表示更大的决心，要在新的一年中争取更加辉煌的成就。（附图表）
