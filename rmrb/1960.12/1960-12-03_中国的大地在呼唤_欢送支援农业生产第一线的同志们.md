Comrades, China's land is calling, you are listening to the Party and coming in batches to the fields, coming to participate in the front lines of agricultural production. This is undertaking a glorious combat mission, just like the People's Liberation Army liberating the Central Plains in those years, just like the Chinese People's Volunteers going to fight in Korea. You are the vanguard of agricultural modernization, and after eight or ten years of diligent production, agricultural production can be completely changed, agricultural modernization can be gradually realized, and an earthly paradise will be built in the countryside.

The countryside is the source of industrial materials production, and the countryside is the sales location for industrial products. Agriculture is the foundation, but industry must play a leading role. The modernization of industry , the modernisation of agriculture, the modernisation of science and technology, the modernization of national defence – these four modernizations are like the four steel strings of a violin, corresponding to each other, cooperating with each other, maneuvering with each other, promoting each other, linked to each other, ensuring each other, and playing together a magnificent musical movement. The theme is: Resist aggression, defend peace, and a great and strong socialist country emerges in the East.

The brothers in the countryside are all happy to the sky, welcoming you with gongs and drums as if you were returning in triumph, and the mountains, rivers, grass, trees, grains, and livestock are all happy. Welcome to you bringing rich gifts, bringing the Party's policies, Chairman Mao's grace, bringing cultural technology, your insights, and bringing new strength, encouragement, and support. We will repay you, first of all by being strong and healthy, so that you can enjoy the freshness of food and air, and then by accepting labor training and participating in production, so that you can become new era peasants who are both red and expert.

If you are literary workers, comrades, then countless Tolstoys are before your eyes. Tolstoy's life, eighty-two years, was almost spent with the land and the plow. And in the countryside, he wrote "War and Peace," and "Anna Karenina" and other majestic chapters. Some manuscripts were revised twenty-one times, just like hoeing weeds in the fields. The former took seven years, and the latter took five years. Those works should be like wheat and apples, rich products from Russian soil.

If you are scientific workers, comrades, then countless Michurins are also before your eyes. You can conquer nature, transform nature, and seize the power of creation from nature. There are vast spaces in the countryside for experimentation, so as to raise Chinese experience to the theoretical stage. The Eight-Character Charter: soil, fertilizer, water, seeds, close planting, protection, tools, and management. You can compile them into eight major codes. The other benefits are too numerous to mention. In short, if agriculture is modernized, the foundation of the new motherland will be as stable as a rock.

Comrades, China's land is calling, and it welcomes everyone to enthusiastically step onto the front lines. We are growing stronger day by day, and the enemy is becoming more and more corrupt day by day, and the situation in which the East Wind prevails over the West Wind is becoming even more obvious. No difficulty can stop the continued leap forward, and the brilliance of the General Line is even more incomparably brilliant. We must be practical and realistic, work hard and cleverly, and we must be diligent and thrifty, and break through cutting-edge technologies. We must listen to the Party and settle down in the countryside, and we must forever display the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought in the rural people's communes throughout the country!

    中国的大地在呼唤
    ——欢送支援农业生产第一线的同志们
    郭沫若一同志们，中国的大地在呼唤，你们听党的话，成批来到田间，前来参加农业生产的第一线。这是承担了光荣的战斗任务，有如当年解放军去解放中原，有如人民志愿军赴朝鲜作战。你们是农业现代化的尖兵团，经过了八年或十年的勤劳生产，就可以使农业生产完全改观，使农业的现代化逐步地实现，在农村中会建设出地上乐园。二农村是工业资料的生产源泉，农村是工业成品的销售地点。农业是基础，但要工业作主导，工业的现代化，农业的现代化，科技的现代化，国防的现代化，这四化有如提琴的四条钢弦，相互照应，相互配合，相互周旋，相互促进，相互联带，相互保险，一同演奏出规模雄伟的乐篇。主题是：反抗侵略，保卫和平，社会主义大强国在东方出现。三农村中的兄弟们都高兴上了天，在打锣打鼓欢迎你们有如凯旋，山川草木，五谷六畜，皆大喜欢。欢迎你们带来了丰富的礼品，带来了党的政策，毛主席的恩典，带来了文化技术，你们的高见，带来了新的力量、鼓舞和支援。我们要回报你们，首先是结实康健，使你们享受到饮食和空气的新鲜，然后是接受劳动锻炼，参加生产，使你们成为新时代的农民又红又专。四如果你们是文艺工作者，同志们，那吗无数的托尔斯泰就在眼前。托尔斯泰的一生，八十二年，差不多是同田地和犁头作伴。而他在乡间写出了《战争与和平》，写出了《安娜·卡列尼娜》等雄篇，手稿有的修改了二十一遍，犹如铲锄那田间的杂草滋蔓，前者费了七年，后者费了五年。那些作品该和小麦苹果一般，是俄罗斯土壤中的丰富生产。五如果你们是科学工作者，同志们，那吗无数的米丘林也就在眼前。你们可以征服自然，改造自然，向自然界夺取到造化的大权。农村中有广阔的天地可供试验，好把中国的经验提高到理论阶段。八字宪法：土、肥、水、种、密、保、工、管，你们尽可以编写成八大法典。此外的好处，叫我们无法说完，总之一句话，如果农业现代化，新生祖国的基础有如磐石之安。六同志们，中国的大地在呼唤，它欢迎大家踊跃地走上前线。我们一天天茁壮，敌人一天天腐烂，东风压倒西风的形势更加显然。任何困难阻挡不住持续跃进，总路线的光芒更加无比地灿烂。我们一定要实事求是，苦干巧干，我们一定要克勤克俭，突破尖端。我们一定要听党的话定住在乡间，我们一定要把毛泽东思想的红旗，在全国的农村人民公社中永远招展！
