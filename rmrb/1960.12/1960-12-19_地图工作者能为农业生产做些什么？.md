Map workers can be useful in many aspects of agricultural production. The "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" touches on almost every aspect related to maps. With the progress of water conservancy, land reclamation, and forest surveys, map workers have surveyed and mapped many topographic maps and investigated many specialized maps. In particular, the establishment of people's communes has presented a series of new tasks for map science. Over the past three years, under the leadership of the Party, surveying and mapping, geography, and construction engineering workers across the country, together with the peasant masses, have carried out map compilation experiments in hundreds of people's communes in conjunction with planning tasks, and have achieved considerable experience and achievements. However, the current map work is still far from meeting the requirements of agricultural production. This situation is mainly reflected in: the types and contents of maps are too simple, the scale of maps is too small, the integration with agricultural production is not close enough, and the solutions to production problems are not specific enough, etc. In order to realize the National Program for Agricultural Development and respond to the great call of the whole Party and the whole people to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, map workers must make further efforts.

What is the most urgent task for current map work in serving agriculture? It is to first serve the expansion of cultivated land area and the overcoming of natural disasters, and then gradually use it to guide field production and garden-style design, so as to create conditions for the realization of the four modernizations of agriculture. Specifically, these tasks are to cooperate with the following tasks in agricultural production.

I. Clear up land resources. Whether it is to increase yield per unit area or to expand cultivated land area, it is first necessary to clarify land resources. A detailed investigation of the current utilization status of each field, classification and grading according to different soils and fertility, and calculation of land area are pressing problems that people's communes and production teams need to solve. To this end, it is first necessary to master reliable statistical data on the distribution and area of ​​land. Otherwise, it will not only be impossible to correctly calculate the land account and water account, but also to carry out linear programming, yield estimation, production layout and production management, and other work. When clearing up land resources, if there are only statistical data and no maps, the data cannot be considered complete. For example, to select a field suitable for developing a certain economic crop for a people's commune, it is necessary to have not only land area statistics and meteorological station observation records, but also to show local differences in soil, climate, and terrain on the map. In this way, the fields that are not suitable for the growth conditions of this crop, as well as the fields that are more suitable for other high-yield crops, are successively removed from the map. Finally, the map specifically indicates which fields fully meet the requirements, and which fields only meet some of the requirements. We have used this method of operating on maps to plan soil and water conservation areas and select citrus orchards, and it has proven to be a simple and effective method. It is an extremely important task to investigate and survey a large-scale map for the people's commune using the methods of more, faster, better, and more economical according to local technical conditions, and to depict as detailed as possible the contents related to agricultural production such as production team boundaries, field ridges, irrigation canals, and road networks.

II. Analyze natural conditions. Only by overcoming natural disasters can we win a bumper harvest in agriculture. The importance of adapting to local conditions and not missing the agricultural season is clearly indicated in the National Program for Agricultural Development. Therefore, within the scope of a commune or a production team, it is very necessary to compile a detailed natural condition evaluation map with fields as units, as the basis for implementing improvement according to local conditions, planting according to local conditions, and fertilizing according to local conditions. For example, to solve the waterlogging problem of a farm (or crop area), it is necessary to compile a drainage map. Moreover, the requirements for this kind of map are not only to describe the hydrological characteristics of rivers, the nature of mountain floods and rainstorms, the groundwater level, the soil permeability and other factors and their impact on the formation of waterlogging, nor only to record historical flood lines and existing measures and benefits (these are just phenomena, only the necessary content and work process for understanding and mastering the laws of nature), but must further calculate the water account, propose measures, and forecast waterlogging. It is necessary to indicate on the map the proportion of various waterlogging factors and the differences between fields, point out how high the water level and the extent of the disaster will be when the rainstorm is large (clarify the quantitative relationship and distribution range), and propose the deployment and effective control area of ​​various measures such as interception, flood diversion, and pond digging (these are the essence of the problem, and the answers required by production practice). When compiling natural condition evaluation maps such as farmland conditions, soil improvement, and drought resistance capabilities, we must also adhere to this viewpoint of closely serving agricultural production.

III. Command field production. Improving cultivation methods, rational fertilization, rational irrigation, rational crop rotation (crop change), intercropping, interplanting and close planting, and achieving timely sowing, weeding and thinning, and harvesting are all very meticulous and complex tasks. Strengthening field management through maps is a relatively scientific method. For example, if the quotas, quantities, and progress of various cultivation measures are plotted on a map with field edges and boundaries, according to plots or crop areas, it will be much more convenient to command production. If the map for commanding production and the method of linear programming are simultaneously grasped by the masses and connected into a dragon to solve problems such as labor allocation, site selection, crop layout, road planning, and sampling yield estimation, it will be more powerful to command production. Because marking the land grade, transportation distance, and supply and demand quantity on the map can not only serve as the basic data for linear programming, but also specifically implement the results of linear programming on the new map. This is a promising working method for improving labor management and improving production efficiency. In addition, storing these maps every year is also a good land file material. Using maps for field management is a new management art and has great political significance. Linking all production indicators with plots and showing them on the map to meet the masses can further promote socialist labor emulation and encourage the masses' enthusiasm for production.

IV. Realize gardenization. Gardenization is the concentrated expression of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture". In order to realize gardenization, it is necessary to consider farmland capital construction issues more carefully. For example, high-yield plots and seed bases require "ridges as straight as lines, land as flat as a mirror, deep plowing and close planting, and intensive cultivation". This requires investigating the soil quality, drainage and irrigation conditions, and yield level of suitable crops in the field, and arranging new drainage and irrigation road systems according to local conditions on the original basis, deploying green belts and fertilizer accumulation points, and proposing field measures for leveling land, improving soil, and adapting to mechanized high-yield cultivation to make agricultural engineering design drawings. In addition, small-scale water conservancy projects, waterlogging drainage, transformation of low-lying land, renovation of terraced fields, soil and water conservation, afforestation, and other field projects will be carried out in large quantities in the future, which requires more agricultural design drawings. This kind of agricultural engineering design map does not need to stick to the "format" of engineering drawings. It must meet the requirements of easy and convenient surveying and mapping, vivid expression, and easy propaganda and education. Among them, three-dimensional model maps are a good form.

The knowledge of maps originates from agriculture. Land measurement in the ancient Eastern alluvial plains was the earliest germination of map science. The Ming Dynasty Fish Scale Atlas, which has been preserved to this day, describes in detail the field ridges, plots, and land grades at that time. Some agricultural atlases based on agricultural statistics have also been published in modern times. However, these agricultural maps are fundamentally different in purpose and content from the maps that are needed today to directly serve the forefront of agricultural production. And these outdated ideas of "agricultural maps" still affect map workers. For example, on current general topographic maps, the content and legends related to agriculture are very insufficient. Deserts and swamps can be divided into five or six types on topographic maps, while cultivated land is simply divided into paddy fields and dry land. Even on some maps with a scale of several thousandths, the boundaries of people's communes, management districts, and production teams cannot be found, let alone the representation of field ridges, plots, crops, and soil quality. Generally speaking, these maps have relatively high precision, but they are not enough to solve the problems of field design or field management. Therefore, map workers must overcome the bourgeois viewpoint, clarify the guiding ideology based on agriculture, deeply analyze and study the characteristics of my country's geographical environment and agricultural development, give full play to their originality, transform and enrich the content of maps to meet the needs of agricultural production.

    地图工作者能为农业生产做些什么？
    中国科学院地理研究所地图研究室
    在农业生产上，很多环节都用得上地图。农业“八字宪法”，几乎条条都同地图有关。随着水利、农垦和森林调查工作的进展，地图工作者测绘了许多地形图，调查了许多专门地图。特别是人民公社的建立，向地图科学提出了一系列新的任务。三年来，在党的领导下，全国测绘、地理和建筑工程工作者，同农民群众一道，结合规划任务，开展了百十个人民公社的地图编制试验，取得了不少的经验和成就。但是，目前地图工作还远远赶不上农业生产的要求。这种状况主要地表现在：地图的类型和内容过于简单，地图的比例尺太小，结合农业生产不够密切，解决生产问题不够具体，等等。为了实现全国农业发展纲要，响应全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的伟大号召，地图工作者必须作进一步的努力。
    当前地图工作在为农业服务方面最迫切的任务是什么呢？就是首先为扩大耕地面积、战胜自然灾害而服务，然后逐步用于指挥田间生产和园田化设计，为实现农业四化创造条件。具体地说，这些任务就是配合农业生产上的以下几件工作。
    一、清查土地资源。不论是提高单位面积产量，还是扩大耕田面积，都首先需要弄清土地资源。详细查明每一块田地的利用现状，按不同的土壤、肥力划分类型和等级，计算土地面积，是当前人民公社、生产队迫切需要解决的一个问题。为此，首先必须掌握可靠的土地的分布和面积的统计数据。否则，不仅不能正确地算土地账，算水账，而且对于进行线性规划、产量估计、生产布局和生产管理等工作也都有不少的困难。在清查土地资源的时候，如果单有统计数据而没有地图，资料还不能算是完全的。例如，要为人民公社选择一块适宜于发展某种经济作物的田地，就不仅要有土地面积统计和气象站的观测纪录，而且要在地图上表示出土壤、气候和地形的局部差异。这样，把不适宜于这种作物生长条件的田块，以及更适宜于其他高产作物的田块，依次从地图上剔去，最后从地图上具体指出：有哪些田块全面符合要求，还有哪些田块只具备了其中的某几项条件。这种在地图上作业的方法，我们曾经用来规划水土保持区域、选择柑桔园地，证明是一种简易的好办法。根据当地技术条件，用多快好省的办法为人民公社调查测绘一份大比例尺的地图，尽可能详细地描绘出生产队界线、地埂田边、灌渠、道路网等有关农业生产的内容，是一件极其重要的工作。
    二、分析自然条件。只有战胜自然灾害，才能夺取农业丰收。因地制宜、不失农时的重要性，在全国农业发展纲要中指示得十分明确。因此，在一个公社或一个生产队的范围内，以田块为单位编制详细的自然条件评价图，作为贯彻因地改良、因地种植、因地施肥的依据，是很有必要的。例如，要解决一个农场（或作物区）的排涝问题，就需要编制一幅排涝地图。并且，对于这种地图的要求，不仅是描述河流的水文特性、山洪暴雨性质、地下水位、土壤渗透能力等因素及其对成涝的影响，不仅是纪述历史洪水界线和现有的措施和效益（这些只是现象，只是认识和掌握自然规律的必要内容和工作过程），而且必须进一步算清水账，提出措施，预报涝情。在地图上表示出各种成涝因素所占的比重和田块间的差异，指出暴雨量多大就将有多高水位和多大成灾范围（明确量的关系和分布范围），提出截流、分洪、挖塘等各种措施的部署和有效控制面积（这些才是问题的本质，才是生产实践所要求的答案）。在编制机耕条件、土壤改良和抗旱能力等自然条件评价图的时候，也都要坚持这种密切为农业生产服务的观点。
    三，指挥田间生产。改进耕作方法，合理施肥，合理灌溉，合理轮作（换茬）、间作、套作和密植，做到及时播种、锄草间苗和收获，这些工作都是十分细致复杂的。通过地图的方式来加强田间管理，是一种比较科学的工作方法。例如，要是在绘有田边、地界的地图上，按地块或作物区，把各种耕作措施的定额、数量和进度标绘出来，那对指挥生产就方便多了。要是把指挥生产的地图和线性规划的方法同时掌握在群众手里，接成一条龙，用来解决劳动力调配、选择场地、作物布局、道路规划和抽样估产等问题，那对指挥生产就更加有力。因为在地图上标出土地的等级、运输距离、供需数量，就既能作为线性规划的基本数据，又能把线性规划的成果，具体落实到新的地图上去。对于改善劳动管理，提高生产效率，这是一种大有前途的工作方法。此外，每年把这些地图汇存起来，又是一种很好的土地档案资料。用地图来进行田间管理是一项新的管理艺术，还有很大的政治意义。把一切生产指标和田块联系在一起，表现在地图上，同群众见面，能够进一步地推动社会主义的劳动竞赛，鼓舞群众的生产干劲。
    四、实现园田化。园田化是农业“八字宪法”的集中表现。为了实现园田化，就要更细致地考虑农田基本建设问题。例如，丰产方和种子基地，要求“埂直如线，地平如镜，深耕密植，精耕细作”。这就需要调查研究田块的土质、排灌条件和宜种作物产量水平，在原有基础上，因地制宜安排新的排灌道路系统，部署绿化带、积肥点，提出平整土地改良土壤适应机耕高产的田间措施，制成农业工程设计图。此外，小型水利工程、除涝排水改造洼地、整修梯田、保持水土、绿化造林等田间工程，将来都要有计划地大量地进行，这就更需要农业设计图了。这种农业工程设计地图，不必拘泥于工程图的“格式”，必须是合乎测绘简易方便，表现形象生动，便于宣传教育的要求。其中，立体模型地图是一种很好的形式。
    地图的学问，渊源来自农业。古代东方泛滥平原上的土地丈量，原是地图科学最早的萌芽。保存至今的明代鱼鳞图册，详细地记述了当时的田埂、地块和土地等级等。近代也出版了一些以农业统计为基础的农业地图集。但是，这些农业地图与今天所需要的直接为农业生产第一线服务的地图，在目的和内容上都是根本不同的。而这些“农业地图”的陈腐观念，至今还影响着地图工作者。例如，在目前一般地形图上，有关农业的内容和图例就很不够，沙漠和沼泽在地形图上可以区分五、六种类型，而耕地只简单地分为水田和旱地，甚至在一些几千分之一比例尺的地图上，还找不到人民公社、管理区、生产队的界线，更不用说表示田埂、地块、作物和土质了。一般地说，这些地图有比较高的精度，但是用来解决田间设计或者田间管理上的问题却是不够的。因此，地图工作者必须克服资产阶级观点，明确以农业为基础的指导思想，深入地分析和研究我国地理环境和农业发展的特点，发挥独创精神，改造和丰富地图的内容，以满足农业生产上的需要。
