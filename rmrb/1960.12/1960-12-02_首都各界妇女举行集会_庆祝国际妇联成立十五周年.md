Xinhua News Agency, December 1st. Women from all walks of life in the capital held a gathering this afternoon to warmly celebrate the 15th anniversary of the founding of the International Democratic Women's Federation.

Li Dequan, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, spoke at the meeting. She said that the establishment of the International Democratic Women's Federation reflected the strong desire and fighting will of hundreds of millions of women around the world, established a clear banner, and has been supported by the vast number of women in various countries.

Li Dequan pointed out that the facts over the past fifteen years have powerfully proven that the clearer the International Democratic Women's Federation's banner of defending world peace, supporting national independence, democratic freedom, and safeguarding the rights of women and children, the more it can point out the direction for women in various countries, the more it can connect the broad masses of women in various countries, and strengthen and develop the unity and cooperation of women from all strata on a common political basis. Only in this way can we form a broad united front against imperialist aggression and for the defense of world peace, and can we constantly strengthen our own strength. She said that we sincerely hope that it will hold its clear banner even higher, continue to carry forward its fine traditions, and achieve greater success.

Speaking of the current excellent international situation, Li Dequan said that the struggles of the people of all countries against imperialism, for the defense of peace, for national independence, democratic freedom, and human progress are related to the fundamental interests of women and children. The women's movement in various countries must be closely combined with the struggles of the people of various countries in order to create conditions for the realization of the rights of women and children.

Li Dequan emphasized that Chinese women and the All-China Women's Federation have always actively participated in and supported the various activities of the International Democratic Women's Federation to safeguard the fundamental interests of women and children in the spirit of proletarian internationalism. The people and women of our country are accelerating the socialist construction of our country with heroic spirit; the people and women of our country have always stood at the forefront of the fight against imperialism and have carried out a tit-for-tat struggle against U.S. imperialism; and have made their due contributions to strengthening the socialist camp and defending peace in the Far East and the world. Chinese women deeply sympathize with and resolutely support the just struggles of women of oppressed nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the oppressed women of other countries, and we regard our support for them as our lofty international obligation. At the same time, their struggles and victories have given us tremendous encouragement and support.

Li Dequan finally pointed out that facing the current excellent situation, as long as we work hard, the situation will become more and more favorable to us. We must work together with the women of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, with the women of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and with all women in the world who love peace and strive for human progress, to jointly fight against the aggression and war policies of imperialism headed by the United States, to defend world peace, and to safeguard the rights of women and children.

Today's meeting was presided over by Pu Jiexiu, Deputy Director of the Beijing Women's Federation.

Among those present at the meeting were Xu Guangping, Liu Qingyang, Vice-Chairmen of the All-China Women's Federation, and Shuai Mengqi, Liu Yaxiong, Luo Shuzhang, Zhao Shilan, and Li Zhen, women from all walks of life in the capital.

    李德全指出，十五年来的事实有力地证明，国际民主妇联的保卫世界和平、支持民族独立和民主自由、维护妇女儿童权利的旗帜越鲜明，就越能给各国妇女指明前进的方向，就越能联系各国广大的妇女群众，并且在共同的政治基础上加强和发展各阶层妇女的团结和合作。这样才能组成广泛的反对帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平的统一战线，才能不断地壮大自己的力量。她说，我们衷心希望它更高地举起自己鲜明的旗帜，继续发扬自己的优良传统，取得更大的成就。
    在谈到目前大好的国际形势时，李德全说，各国人民反对帝国主义、保卫和平、争取民族独立、民主自由和人类进步的斗争，关系到妇女儿童的根本利益。各国妇女运动必须和各国人民的斗争紧密结合，才能为实现妇女儿童的权利创造条件。
    李德全强调说，中国妇女和妇女联合会，一向本着无产阶级国际主义的精神，积极参加和支持国际民主妇联维护妇女儿童根本利益的各项活动。我国人民和妇女，正在以英雄的气概加速我国的社会主义建设；我国人民和妇女，始终站在反对帝国主义的最前列，和美帝国主义进行了针锋相对的斗争；为壮大社会主义阵营，为保卫远东和世界和平，作出了自己应有的贡献。中国妇女深切地同情并且坚决地支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲被压迫民族的妇女和其他国家被压迫妇女的正义斗争，我们把对她们的支持看作是我们崇高的国际义务。同时，她们的斗争和胜利，也使我们得到莫大的鼓舞和支持。
    李德全最后指出，我们面对着当前的大好形势，只要我们努力奋斗，形势会对我们越来越有利。我们要同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的妇女一道，同亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的妇女一道，同全世界一切爱好和平争取人类进步的妇女一道，为反对以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，为保卫世界和平，为维护妇女儿童权利而共同奋斗。
