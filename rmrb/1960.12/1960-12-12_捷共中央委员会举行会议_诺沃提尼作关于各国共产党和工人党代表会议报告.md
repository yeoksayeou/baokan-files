This document profoundly expounds all the basic problems of our era, it is an important and creative development of our Marxist-Leninist doctrine, and it provides a clear fighting line for Communists all over the world. The Appeal to the People of the World, unanimously adopted, mobilizing further struggle for peace, democracy, national independence and socialism, is also of great significance.

The declaration once again inspires and enthusiastically calls on people to devote themselves to progressive labor and struggle, for the happiness of our country and our people, for the happy future of all working people, and for the final victory of communism. Therefore, it is warmly welcomed by our entire party.

    The meeting passed a resolution expressing full agreement and support for the documents of the Moscow meeting—the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties and the Appeal to the People of the World. The resolution holds that these documents are instructions of immeasurable importance for the international communist movement to mobilize in the struggle for peace, democracy and national independence, and for socialism and communism. The resolution also warmly welcomes the unanimity shown by the representatives of eighty-one Communist and Workers' Parties from all over the world in passing the declaration. In putting the principles of these documents into practice, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia will continue to consolidate the fraternal internationalist alliance with the entire international communist movement.
