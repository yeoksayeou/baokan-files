Xinhua News Agency, Hefei Telegram: Huainan Coal Mine, while striving to better complete this year's production plan, is actively strengthening tunneling, capital construction, machinery and equipment, and roadway maintenance, in order to make good production preparations for the first quarter of next year.

Starting in November, Huainan Coal Mine transferred a group of personnel from auxiliary departments to strengthen the tunneling force, vigorously promoted rapid tunneling experience, and launched a competition to accelerate footage. The progress plans of all thirty-three capital construction and tunneling teams and groups in the bureau have been completed well. In early November, the tunneling and capital construction footage increased by 13% and 55% respectively compared with the same period in October.

In previous years, large equipment such as hoisting equipment and substations that must be shut down for maintenance were only repaired during the New Year or Spring Festival holidays. This year, they decided to adopt a method of rotating maintenance for each mine to advance the above-mentioned maintenance projects. The entire mine has arranged these maintenance projects, formulated technical measures, and organized special forces to prepare materials and tools to shorten the maintenance time. They also strengthened the regular repair and matching work for some equipment that can be repaired normally and some equipment that has been damaged. The General Repair and Assembly Plant and the Cement Support Plant are concentrating their efforts on producing accessories and cement supports for mining and transportation equipment for the first quarter of next year. In early November, the Mining Bureau organized a coal car repair team of more than sixty people to go to various mines to help repair coal cars. Datong Mine alone repaired more than 200 coal cars in half a month, and also repaired more than ten sets (pieces) of mining equipment and tools.

All mines have systematically checked the maintenance of roadways, checking and repairing at the same time. Xie San Mine extracted more than sixty people to form six special inspection teams to comprehensively inspect the water and dry mining areas, improved the engineering specifications of the up and down wind roadways, improved fifty cables that were laid unreasonably and poorly hung, cleared more than 300 meters of key roadways, and installed 290 meters of pedestrian handrails down the mountain, etc.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, December 17th: Zibo Mining Bureau is accelerating tunneling work to prepare conditions for the sustained leap forward in production next year.

The Party Committee of the Mining Bureau recently held a symposium of advanced tunneling team leaders and a production preparation meeting attended by mine managers and engineering technicians, earnestly reviewed the balanced organization of coal mining and tunneling, and enlightened and educated cadres through typical case comparisons. According to the actual production situation, Xinbo Coal Mine organized coal mining and tunneling work according to a certain proportion. This year, it not only overfulfilled the coal production plan 62 days ahead of schedule, but also achieved a recoverable period of coal volume of six months by the end of November, preparing sufficient working faces for the continued leap forward from January to May next year. Heishan Coal Mine failed to maintain a certain proportion of coal mining and tunneling, so this year's production level was sometimes high and sometimes low, and the recoverable period of coal volume also decreased from 4.39 months at the end of last year to the current 2.4 months.

Through comparative education, all mine shafts unanimously realized that simultaneously promoting mining and tunneling is a fundamental issue for coal mines to achieve sustained, balanced, and high production. In order to seize the opportunity and prepare for next year's production, recently, nine mines and twenty-two shafts in the entire bureau have extracted thirty-five cadres at the mine and shaft level to focus on tunneling. At the same time, 214 workers were transferred from ground auxiliary workers and extraction workers to strengthen the tunneling force, increasing the number of tunneling "faces" from the original 156 to 174. The entire mine also transferred 39 dispatchers to be specifically responsible for grasping the situation of dispatch and production preparation.

All mines have also vigorously strengthened tunneling technical guidance, with the chief engineer taking the lead in organizing a three-in-one technical research team composed of technicians and veteran workers to go deep into the site to help workers promote advanced tunneling equipment and twelve advanced experiences in rapid tunneling according to local conditions, so that the tunneling progress has been significantly improved. The workers of Meng Xiangui Tunneling Team of Heishan Mine, due to their persistence in using tunneling combines, increased the daily progress of the main roadway from 3.6 meters to 7.5 meters.

Xinhua News Agency, Hegang, December 17th: Hegang Coal Mine Xin Yi Mine has completed its annual coal mining and tunneling plan ahead of schedule and overfulfilled the plan by December 10. The entire mine has prepared thirty-four tunneling faces, which are sufficient for mining for the next four months. Now, the entire mine is carrying out tunneling and other preparations for the production in the second quarter of next year.

Xin Yi Mine often organizes production in accordance with the requirements of maintaining an appropriate ratio between mining and tunneling. According to the situation of this mine, using the usual coal mining method, every 1,000 tons of coal mined requires 26 to 30 meters of roadway tunneling, or that each coal mining face must have three tunneling faces to ensure mining and tunneling balance and sustained leap forward. Because this mine has achieved this "three tunnelings to ensure one mining," the entire mine has maintained the initiative in production in the first eleven months of this year despite unfavorable production conditions, overfulfilling the plan every month and achieving sustained, balanced, and high production.

This year, this mine is at the end of the first coal seam mining stage, with many faults, abnormal coal seam thickness, and long transportation lines, which adds many difficulties to coal mining. However, because the entire mine has always maintained an appropriate ratio between tunneling and coal mining, production is still very active. For example, in April this year, the 301 coal mining face in the third mining area was only enough for three days of mining due to the arching of the floor and changes in the formation, and it was about to disrupt the original coal mining plan for the third mining area. However, because there were spare faces in this mining area, they were able to calmly move to the spare faces to continue mining. As a result, the monthly output of this mining area was not only not affected, but also overfulfilled the production plan, increasing by more than 1,900 tons compared with the average monthly production level in the first quarter.

This mine can often maintain mining and tunneling balance because it has continuously adjusted the ratio of coal mining and tunneling, so that the tunneling work of the entire mine has always been in the lead. For example, in the spring of this year, the 301 face of the third mining area of this mine adopted a new coal mining method, and the efficiency was more than doubled. At this time, the mining and tunneling ratio also changed. Every 1,000 tons of coal produced must tunnel 45 meters of roadway to maintain mining and tunneling balance. For this reason, this mining area organized three tunneling teams to specifically prepare for the 301 face, ensuring that there were still sufficient spare faces to achieve sustained high production after the coal mining efficiency was improved. Sometimes changes in geological conditions can also cause an imbalance between tunneling and coal mining.

In July this year, according to the production situation at that time, the first mining area had to open up 180 meters of main roadway within two months to maintain balanced high production. However, when tunneling to 70 meters, they suddenly encountered a large amount of water. The original plan was to advance 8 meters per day, but only 3 meters were actually completed, and it was clear that the production of the first mining area would be affected. The cadres of the tunneling team in the mining area immediately went down to serve as squad leaders and directly led the workers to overcome difficulties. The mine manager in charge of tunneling also went to this tunneling team to directly lead. Due to the strengthening of leadership and overcoming the difficulties caused by the large amount of water to blasting and transportation, the daily progress quickly increased from the original 3 meters to 9 meters, reaching a maximum of 11 meters. As a result, this main roadway project was still completed according to plan, ensuring sustained high production in the first mining area.

Contemporary Hero

Luo Tingfu, Secretary of the Party Committee of Yingcheng Coal Mine in Jilin Province, has insisted on going deep into the mine for the past three years to work and discuss with workers and grassroots cadres, and he also seizes key issues in everything and sees them through to the end. While the enthusiasm of the masses for labor is high and production is continuously leaping forward, he also actively and properly arranges the lives of employees, so that employees can eat well, sleep well, and rest well. Therefore, the workers call him a "confidant" and the Party Committee Secretary of the "face" (i.e., the working face).

    鹤岗新一矿已经准备好三十四个掘进掌子
    新华社合肥电　淮南煤矿在争取更好地完成今年生产计划的同时，积极加强掘进、基本建设、机械设备和巷道维修工作，为明年第一季度作好生产准备。
    从11月份开始，淮南煤矿就从辅助部门抽调一批人员充实掘进力量，并且大力推广快速掘进经验，展开了加快进尺的竞赛。全局三十三个基建和掘进队、组，进尺计划都完成得很好，11月上旬掘进和基建进尺比10月份同期分别提高13％和55％。
    往年，凡是必须停产检修的提升设备、变电所等大型设备，都要到新年或春节假期才检修。今年，他们决定采取各矿轮流检修的办法，使上述检修工程提前进行。全矿已安排了这些检修项目，拟定了技术措施，并且组织专门力量做好材料工具等准备工作，以缩短检修时间。对一些平时能检修的设备和一些已损坏的设备，也加强了经常性的修复和配套工作。总修配厂和水泥支架厂，正在集中力量为明年第一季度生产采掘、运输设备的配件和水泥支架。11月初，矿务局组织了六十多人的煤车修复队，分赴各矿帮助修煤车。仅大通矿半个月就修复煤车二百多辆，还修好采掘设备和工具十多台（件）。
    各矿都系统地检查了巷道的维修工作，边查边修。谢三矿抽出六十多人组成六个专门检查小组，全面检查水、旱采区，改进了上下风巷的工程规格，改进了五十处敷设不合理吊挂不好的电缆，清理了三百多米重点巷道，安装了二百九十米下山的行人扶手等。
    据新华社济南17日电　淄博矿务局加速掘进工作，为明年生产的持续跃进准备条件。
    矿务局党委最近先后召开了先进掘进队队长座谈会和由矿长、工程技术人员参加的生产准备会议，认真检查了均衡地组织采煤掘进的情况，并通过典型事例对比，启发与教育了干部。新博煤矿根据生产实际情况，按照一定的比例组织采煤、掘进工作，今年不仅提前六十二天超额完成产煤计划，而且到11月底，全矿获得煤量的可采期已达到六个月，为明年1至5月份继续跃进，准备了充足的工作面。黑山煤矿没有能够使采煤和掘进保持一定的比例，因而今年的生产水平时高时低，获得煤量的可采期也由去年年底的四点三九个月降低到目前的二点四个月。
    通过对比教育，各矿井一致认识到采、掘并举是煤矿实现持续均衡高产的一个根本问题。为了抓紧时机，给明年生产做好准备，最近，全局九个矿二十二个井，已抽出矿、井级三十五名干部专抓掘进。同时又从地面辅助工和回采工中抽调出二百一十四名工人充实掘进力量，使掘进“迎头”由原来的一百五十六个增加到一百七十四个。全矿还抽调三十九名调度员专门负责掌握调度和生产准备的情况。
    各矿还大力加强了掘进技术指导，以总工程师为首组织技术员和老工人成立三结合技术研究小组，深入现场，帮助工人因地制宜地推广了先进的掘进机具和十二种快速掘进的先进经验，使掘进进度显著提高。黑山矿孟宪贵掘进队的职工，由于坚持使用了掘进康拜因，主巷日进由三点六米提高到七点五米。
    据新华社鹤岗17日电　鹤岗煤矿新一矿到12月10日为止，已提前并超额完成了全年的采煤掘进计划。全矿已准备出三十四个掘进掌子，足够今后四个月开采。现在，全矿又为明年第二季度的生产进行掘进等准备工作。
    新一矿经常依据采掘保持适当比例的要求，组织生产。根据这个矿的情况，用通常的采煤法，每采一千吨煤，需要掘进二十六米到三十米巷道，或者说每一个采煤掌子要有三个掘进掌子，才能保证采掘平衡，持续跃进。这个矿由于实现了这种“三掘保一采”，全矿今年前十一个月在不利的生产条件下，仍然掌握了生产的主动权，月月都超额完成了计划，实现了持续的均衡的高产。
    今年，这个矿已处在第一层煤开采的结束阶段，断层多，煤层厚薄不正常，运输线路长，为开采煤炭增加很多困难。但由于全矿掘进和采煤始终保持了适当的比例，所以生产仍很主动。如今年4月，三采区的301采煤掌子因为底板拱起，地层发生变化，掌子上的煤只够三天开采，眼看着就要打乱三采区原订的采煤计划。但因为这个采区里有备用掌子，他们就能从容不迫地搬到备用掌子去继续采煤。结果，这个采区的月产量不仅没有受到影响，而且超额完成了生产计划，比第一季度平均月产水平还增加了一千九百多吨。
    这个矿能经常保持采掘平衡，是由于不断调整了采煤和掘进的比例，使全矿的掘进工作一直领先。如今年春天，这个矿三采区301掌子采用了新采煤法采煤，效率提高了一倍以上。这时采掘比例也就发生了变化，每出一千吨煤，必须掘进四十五米巷道，才能保持采掘平衡，为此，这个采区组织了三个掘进组专门为301掌子作准备，保证了采煤效率提高以后，仍有充足的备用掌子实现持续高产。有时地质情况的变化，也会使掘进和采煤之间出现不平衡。
    今年7月间，根据当时的生产情况，一采区必须在两个月内开拓出一百八十米主巷，才能保持均衡高产。但当掘进到七十米的时候，突然遇到大水。原计划日进八米，实际只完成三米，眼看着一采区的生产就要受到影响。采区掘进队的干部立即全部下去当班长，直接带领工人克服困难。管掘进的矿长也下到这个掘进队去直接领导。由于加强了领导，克服了大水给爆破和运输等造成的困难，日进度迅速由原来三米提高到九米，最高达到十一米。结果，这项主巷工程仍然按计划完成，保证了一采区持续高产。当代英雄
    吉林省营城煤矿党委书记罗廷富三年来坚持深入井下和工人、基层干部一起同劳动同商量，并且事事抓关键，一抓到底。在群众劳动热情高涨生产不断跃进中，他同时积极妥善安排职工生活，使职工吃好睡好休息好。因此工人们称他是“知心朋友”和“掌子头”（即工作面）的党委书记。
