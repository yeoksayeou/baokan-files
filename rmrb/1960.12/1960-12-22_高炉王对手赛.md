	Blast Furnace King Competition
	Liu Wenyu
	Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 10 Blast Furnace and Wuhan Iron and Steel's No. 2 Blast Furnace are both among China's current large-scale blast furnaces, known as the Kings of Blast Furnaces. They recently launched a competition, and the two furnace chiefs are old comrades from Anshan Iron and Steel's indigenous blast furnaces three years ago. Two blast furnaces, two towers, two pagodas shake the world. You are by the Yangtze River in Wuhan, I am under the Qianshan Mountains in the Northeast. Two blast furnaces for increased production, thousands of miles to hook up, to compete for the first merit of increased production, dragons soaring and tigers leaping across warhorses. Two blast furnaces set up battle formations, molten iron boils and steel blooms, the Liao River merges with the Yangtze River waves, ten thousand miles of iron flow spread red glow. Two furnace chiefs shake hands, iron fists swear under the red flag, in order to make steel and make great achievements, ten thousand mountains can be swallowed. Two blast furnaces are new friends, two furnace chiefs are old soldiers, they used to manage one furnace together, today one root blooms two flowers. Qianshan is high, the Yangtze is long, where will the red flag be planted? At the end of the year, the steel commander reports good news, the Yangtze River turns red to the Qianshan Mountains.

    高炉王对手赛
    刘文玉
    鞍钢十号高炉和武钢二号高炉，都是我国当前大型高炉之一，号称高炉之王，它们最近展开了对手赛，而这两位炉长又都是三年前鞍钢的土高炉老战友。两座高炉两座塔，两座宝塔震天下，你在武汉长江边，我在东北千山下。两座高炉为增产，千里迢迢把钩挂，要争增产第一功，龙腾虎跃跨战马。两座高炉摆阵势，铁水沸腾钢开花，辽河汇合长江浪，万里铁流泛红霞。两位炉长一握手，铁拳宣誓红旗下，为了炼钢立奇功，万座大山吞得下。两座高炉是新友，两位炉长是老人马，当年同管一座炉，今日一根两朵花。千山高，长江长，要看红旗插在哪？年底钢帅传捷报，长江红到千山下。
