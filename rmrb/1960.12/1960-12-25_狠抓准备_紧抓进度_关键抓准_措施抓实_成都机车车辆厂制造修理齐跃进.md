Chengdu Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant Achieves Great Leap Forward in Manufacturing and Repair

(Our newspaper Chengdu, December 24th) The Chengdu Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant, which developed during the Great Leap Forward in the past two years, is advancing at a high speed again this year. One after another, brand-new locomotives are being sent out of the factory to participate in national construction; one after another, locomotives that have lost their production capacity are quickly regaining their youth here and returning to their production posts. The entire factory has comprehensively overfulfilled this year's state plan twenty-one days ahead of schedule.

This year, the factory's products are diverse, of high quality, and have a large growth rate, with manufacturing and repair advancing simultaneously. As of December 10th, the production of new locomotives has completed 415% of the annual state plan, with each unit meeting technical standards; locomotive repairs have completed 100.7% of the plan, an increase of 46.8% compared to the same period last year, and the repair rework rate has decreased by 9.5% compared to the plan; the production of various other accessories has also greatly exceeded the original plan, with the quality all meeting national standards; the total output value and labor productivity have greatly overfulfilled the state plan, increasing by nearly two times compared to the same period last year; and the cost of comparable products has decreased by 16% compared to last year.

The tasks of manufacturing locomotives, repairing locomotives, and manufacturing various accessories at the Chengdu Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant this year have greatly increased compared to last year, and the tasks are quite arduous, with many difficulties in completing the tasks. While facing difficulties and despising difficulties, all the factory's employees also paid attention to difficulties in the specific completion of tasks. At the beginning of the year, the factory's Party committee held several enlarged meetings of the Party committee to analyze the objective and subjective difficulties in completing this year's production tasks, and put forward solutions and measures to solve the difficulties. After analysis, the factory concluded that there were three major difficulties in completing the annual plan: the lack of major large-scale equipment needed for new locomotives, and the lack of many precision lathes and tools; weak technical strength, with most of the workers being new apprentices who entered the factory in the past two years; and the quantity, specifications, and varieties of raw materials not being able to meet the needs of production. Seeing these three major difficulties clearly, the factory's Party committee took solving the problems of insufficient equipment, technical strength, and raw materials as the three major directions of attack this year. The methods they adopted to overcome the difficulties were: taking increasing production and practicing economy as the key, vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, manufacturing indigenous machine tools and indigenous equipment, and fully tapping the potential of existing equipment; running their own raw material factories, carrying out product revolution, improving product quality, and saving raw materials; and at the same time, formulating a plan to vigorously train new apprentices.

In order to complete the annual plan, the factory carried out three technical innovation and technical revolution shock movements this year. Starting from the first quarter, a high tide of building indigenous equipment and indigenous machine tools was launched to address the shortage of major equipment. The factory successively rushed to manufacture 199 units (pieces) of equipment such as large gantry planers, shapers, and pneumatic tools, which basically met the needs of new locomotive manufacturing, locomotive repair, and accessory production. Subsequently, a movement to improve the degree of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation and "Duobao-ization" was launched. This movement greatly improved the degree of mechanization in the factory. Many new technologies, new processes, and advanced operating methods were combined into sets and concentrated on one piece of equipment and one tool, and Duobao process regulations were formulated to consolidate these innovative achievements, thereby effectively leveraging the potential of the equipment. The efficiency of the equipment generally increased by two to six times, meeting the needs of production. At the same time, through the practical exercise of the technical revolution, as well as one teacher with many apprentices, master-apprentice teaching and learning, and apprentice mutual teaching and learning, more than 90% of the apprentices were able to operate independently after the second quarter, basically solving the contradiction between large tasks and weak technical strength.

After the rapid growth of equipment capacity and technical strength, from July onwards, the lack of raw materials became the main contradiction that needed to be resolved urgently. Under the leadership of the Party committee, the factory's employees quickly launched a movement of "clever design, clever cutting, clever stoking, clever construction, and clever housekeeping" to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. The factory formed more than 100 raw material and fuel shock teams to collect all available waste materials. The factory also established nine satellite factories for calcium carbide, water glass, rock essence rods, screws, rivets, etc. Through this movement, many workshops, groups, and individuals achieved using one material for multiple purposes. Simply by changing the boiler cutting method, more than 400 kilograms of steel plates were saved in the construction of a new locomotive. Due to the development of this movement, many raw material varieties changed from being insufficient to having a surplus, and from relying on solutions from other places and factories to being self-sufficient.

Since the beginning of this year, the factory has consistently adopted the working methods of "grasping preparation vigorously, grasping progress tightly, grasping the key accurately, and grasping measures solidly." While arranging production plans, they also arranged preparation work plans. While grasping progress tightly, they regarded grasping daily progress as the central link in completing the monthly plan. At the same time, when solving each specific problem, no matter how big or small, the measures were fully reliable.

In each period this year, the Chengdu Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant not only fully estimated the new situations and new problems that might arise in production, but also fully noted the new situations and new problems that might arise in the thinking of employees, and promptly improved the ideological understanding and awareness level of employees. In August and September this year, because the problems of equipment capacity and raw material supply were basically solved, the factory's production situation was very good. At this time, individual cadres believed that the problem of comprehensively overfulfilling the state plan was no longer a major one. Was there really no problem? The Party committee secretary focused on inspecting the work of the scheduling department. The result was that it was found that the castings in October could not keep up with the needs of mechanical processing, the processing and assembly of the axle boxes in the locomotive workshop were out of sync, and the boiler water pressure could not keep up with the production progress. The Party committee immediately used these examples as vivid teaching materials, and promptly criticized this blind optimism, complacency, and relaxation of effort in the cadre meeting. All departments, workshops, and groups in the factory also actively carried out mass activities to check for problems, formulate measures, and fill loopholes. As a result, the broad masses of employees have always maintained high morale, moving from one victory to another.

    狠抓准备　紧抓进度　关键抓准　措施抓实
    成都机车车辆厂制造修理齐跃进
    本报成都24日电　在前两年大跃进中发展起来的成都机车车辆工厂，今年又以高速度的步伐向前跃进。一台台崭新的机车不断被送出工厂，参加祖国建设；一辆辆失去生产能力的机车很快在这里恢复了青春，重返生产岗位。全厂已提前二十一天全面超额完成了今年国家计划。
    这个厂今年生产的产品品种多，质量好，增长幅度大，制造和修理齐头并进。截至本月10日止，新造机车已完成全年国家计划415％，台台达到技术标准；修理机车完成计划100.7％，比去年同期增长46.8％，修理返工率比计划降低9.5％；其它各种配件生产也大大超过原计划，质量全部合乎国家标准；总产值、劳动生产率都大大超额完成国家计划，比去年同期增长近两倍；可比产品成本比去年下降16％。
    成都机车车辆工厂今年制造机车和修理机车、制造各种配件的任务比去年大大增加，任务相当繁重，完成任务存在着不少困难。全厂职工在面对困难、藐视困难的同时，在具体完成任务中又重视困难。年初，工厂党委曾多次召开党委扩大会议，分析了完成今年生产任务所存在的主客观困难，提出了解决困难的方案和措施。经过分析，全厂完成全年计划有三大困难：缺少新造机车需要的主要大型设备，许多精密的车床、机具也缺乏；技术力量薄弱，绝大部分工人是前两年进厂的新学工；原料材料的数量、规格品种不能满足生产的需要。看清了这三大困难，厂党委就把解决设备、技术力量和原料材料不足的问题，作为今年三大主攻方向。他们采取克服困难的办法是：以增产节约为纲，大力进行技术革新和技术革命，制造土机床土设备，并充分挖掘现有设备潜力；自办原料材料工厂，开展产品革命，提高产品质量和节省原料材料；同时制订出了大力培养新学工的规划。
    为完成全年计划，全厂今年开展了三次技术革新和技术革命突击运动。从第一季度开始，便针对所缺的主要设备，掀起了大造土设备、土机床的高潮，全厂先后赶制出大型龙门刨床、牛头刨床、风动工具等设备一百九十九台（件），基本满足了新造机车、修理机车和生产配件的需要。接着，又开展了提高机械化半机械化、自动化半自动化程度和“多宝化”的运动。这一运动大大提高了全厂机械化的程度，许多新技术、新工艺、先进操作法配成套，在一台设备和一种工具上集中使用，并制成多宝工艺规程，巩固了这些革新成果，从而有效地发挥了设备潜力，设备的工效一般提高了二至六倍，满足了生产的需要。与此同时，广大职工通过技术革命的实际锻炼，以及一师多徒，师徒包教包学和徒工互教互学等方法，使90％以上的徒工在二季度以后，都能独立操作，基本上解决了任务大和技术力量薄弱的矛盾。
    设备能力和技术力量迅速增长以后，从7月份开始，缺乏原料材料就成为急待解决的主要矛盾。全厂职工在党委领导下，迅速掀起了“设计巧、下料巧、司炉巧、施工巧、管家巧”运动，开源节流。全厂组成了一百多个原料、燃料突击队，收集一切可利用的废旧材料。全厂还自办起了电石、水玻璃、岩精棒、螺丝、铆钉等九个卫星工厂。通过这一运动，许多车间、小组和个人，做到了一分材料几分用。新造一台机车，只是由于改变了锅炉下料方法，便节约钢板四百多公斤。由于开展这一运动，许多原料材料品种由不够变为有余，由依靠外地外厂解决变为自给自足。
    今年以来，这个厂自始至终采取了“狠抓准备、紧抓进度、关键抓准、措施抓实”的工作方法。在安排生产计划的同时，就安排准备工作计划。在紧抓进度中，他们把抓日进度作为完成月计划的中心环节。同时，在解决每一个具体问题的时候，不论大小，措施都充分可靠。
    成都机车车辆工厂在每一个时期中，不但充分估计到生产上可能出现的新情况、新问题，也充分注意到职工思想上可能出现的新情况、新问题，及时提高职工的思想认识水平和觉悟水平。在今年8、9月份，由于基本解决了设备能力、原料供应等问题，全厂生产情况很好，这时个别干部便认为全面超额完成国家计划的问题不大了。究竟有没有问题呢？党委书记重点检查了调度部门的工作。结果发现10月份的铸件赶不上机械加工的需要，机车车间的加工和组装的座箱脱节，锅炉的水压也赶不上生产进度等问题，党委随即把这些事例作为活教材，在干部会议上，及时批判了这种盲目乐观、自满松劲情绪。全厂各个部门和车间、小组，也积极开展了查问题、订措施、补漏洞的群众活动。因而使广大职工始终保持着高昂的斗志，从一个胜利走向另一个胜利。
