    Small Knowledge

    Ash fertilizer generally refers to plant ash. Plant ash is quite rich in potassium (wood ash contains about 10% potassium oxide, and grass ash contains about 5% potassium oxide). Potassium is one of the three main fertilizer elements.
    Potassium has many effects on crops. If gramineous crops lack potassium, tillering ability will be reduced, nodes will be short, and plants will be weak. If tuber crops and sugar beets lack potassium, their yield and quality will be affected.
    In various parts of China, there is a custom of topdressing rice, wheat and other crops with plant ash to prevent lodging. In many areas, sweet potatoes, potatoes, sugar beets, and tobacco are also cultivated using plant ash as base fertilizer, so the demand for ash fertilizer is very large.

    灰肥
    灰肥一般指的是草木灰。草木灰含有相当丰富的钾（木灰含氧化钾百分之十左右，草灰含氧化钾约百分之五），钾是肥料三项主要元素之一。
    钾对农作物的作用是多方面的。禾本科农作物缺乏钾素，分蘖力减低，节尖短小，植株纤弱。薯类作物和甜菜等缺钾，就会影响它们的产量和品质。
    我国各地都有用草木灰追施水稻、小麦等作物的习惯，以防止倒伏。许多地区栽培甘薯、马铃薯、甜菜、烟草也都施用草木灰作基肥，因此灰肥的需要量是很大的。
