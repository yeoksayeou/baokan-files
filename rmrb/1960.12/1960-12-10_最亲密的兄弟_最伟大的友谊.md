Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, and head of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation, at the invitation of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Government, after participating in the celebration of the 43rd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, attending the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties held in Moscow, and holding talks between the leaders of the Chinese and Soviet Parties, accompanied by Comrade Brezhnev, member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and other comrades, paid a friendly visit to our fraternal ally, the great Soviet Union, and was warmly welcomed and given a grand reception by the Soviet Party and Government leaders and the broad masses of the people. The Chinese Party and Government Delegation headed by Comrade Liu Shaoqi went to the Soviet Union with a deep desire to strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship and unity. Now, they have returned to Beijing with the fraternal sentiments of the Soviet people towards the Chinese people. There is no doubt that Chairman Liu Shaoqi’s visit has further consolidated and developed the great friendship and unity between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, and has written a glorious page in the history of Sino-Soviet friendship.

During Chairman Liu Shaoqi's visit to the Soviet Union, the fraternal Soviet people fully expressed their deep friendship towards the Chinese people. In Moscow and Leningrad, in Minsk and Irkutsk, it was like a festival, with thousands upon thousands of people braving the severe cold and snow to warmly welcome their Chinese brothers. Wherever the Chinese Party and Government Delegation went, whether in cities or villages, in factories or collective farms, cheers of "Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples" resounded everywhere. In Moscow, the capital of the great Soviet Union, a mass rally of 12,000 people was held to warmly welcome Chairman Liu Shaoqi and the Chinese Party and Government Delegation. Workers at the Kirov factory said: We are brothers, our friendship is an eternal friendship. Members of the Gastello Collective Farm said: We are connected heart to heart, and our friendship will continue to develop. Students in Moscow said: In the world, rivers may dry up, mountains may be leveled, but the great friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples is eternal and unbreakable. These heartfelt and moving words profoundly demonstrate how deep and sincere the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is, and fully demonstrate how great the strength of the unity between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is!

The great victory of the October Revolution began a new era in the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. The Chinese Communists and the Chinese people have always regarded the Chinese revolution as a continuation of the October Revolution, have always regarded the great achievements of the Soviet people in building socialism and communism as their example, and have always regarded the great Soviet people as their closest brothers and most reliable friends. For forty-three years, the Chinese people have been listening with great attention to the footsteps of the great Soviet people forging ahead. The Chinese people cheered for the great victories achieved by the Soviet people in socialist construction and the Patriotic War, cheered for the great achievements made by the Soviet people in implementing the magnificent Seven-Year Plan and fully launching communist construction, cheered for the world-shaking achievements made by the Soviet people in conquering the universe, and cheered for the great contributions made by the Soviet people in the noble cause of safeguarding world peace. The Chinese people regard all the achievements of the Soviet people as their own achievements and are proud of these achievements. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people have always been loyal to the principles of proletarian internationalism and regard maintaining and strengthening the great unity between China and the Soviet Union and between the two parties as their sacred responsibility. The Chinese government and people have always actively supported the efforts of the Soviet government and people to safeguard world peace, and will always stand with the Soviet Union and fight to the end for the victory of world peace and the cause of human progress.

The friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union has been continuously consolidated and developed through the unremitting efforts of the two peoples. Shortly after the founding of the People's Republic of China, China and the Soviet Union signed the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. Over the past eleven years, the mutual assistance and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in political, economic, cultural and other fields have made great achievements. In our country's socialist construction, we have received tremendous assistance from the Soviet Union. The Soviet government and the Soviet people firmly support the Chinese people's struggle to defend their national sovereignty and territorial integrity. Comrade Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, once warned American imperialism: an attack on the People's Republic of China is an attack on the Soviet Union. At the recently concluded 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly, Comrade Khrushchev resolutely advocated restoring China's legitimate rights in the United Nations and sternly refuted the shameless slanders and libels made by the United States against China. The Chinese people will never forget the great assistance and support given to our country by the Soviet government and the Soviet people.

The friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, which has been tempered over forty years, is the cornerstone of the unity of the entire socialist camp and the unity of the entire international communist movement. China and the Soviet Union, are the two largest countries in the socialist camp, and the Communist Party of China and Communist Party of the Soviet Union are the two largest parties in the international communist movement. The unity of China and the Soviet Union, the unity of the two parties, the unity of the eight hundred and sixty million people of the two countries, is of utmost importance not only for the unity of the entire socialist camp and the entire international communist movement, but will also inevitably have a tremendous impact on the course of the world. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: The unity of the people of the two great powers of China and the Soviet Union "will not only inevitably affect the prosperity of the two great powers of China and the Soviet Union, but will inevitably affect the future of mankind and affect the victory of world peace and justice."

The great unity between the two countries and two parties of China and the Soviet Union is an important guarantee for the victory of world peace and the cause of human progress, and a powerful factor in preventing imperialism from launching a new war. Therefore, imperialism and all reactionaries hate this unity very much and are always trying to undermine it in every possible way. However, the dreams of imperialism have become a historical laughingstock time and time again. The statement and appeal to the people of the world unanimously adopted by the conference of eighty-one Communist and Workers' Parties show the further consolidation of the unity of the socialist camp and the entire international communist movement. Similarly, it also shows the further consolidation of the unity between the two parties and two countries of the China and Soviet Union. This great proletarian internationalist unity, based on Marxism-Leninism, left a very significant and indelible impression on the people of the world during Chairman Liu Shaoqi's visit to the Soviet Union.

Regarding this unity, Comrade Brezhnev, member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, said well at the banquet held by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Byelorussia, the Presidium of the Supreme Council and the Council of Ministers of the Byelorussian Republic for our party and government delegation: "We give a lofty evaluation to our friendship. It conforms to the wishes of the peoples of the Soviet Union and China, strengthens the unity and power of the entire socialist camp, and plays a major role in the struggle of the peoples of all countries against the aggressive conspiracies of imperialism and for the victory of world peace and a bright future for mankind."

Chairman Liu Shaoqi once again emphasized at the Sino-Soviet friendship mass rally held in Moscow: "Our common enemy—the imperialists headed by the United States—are always trying in every possible way to undermine the unity between China and the Soviet Union. But, just like not being able to see the sun rising from the west, they will never see the separation between the two great parties, the great countries, and the great peoples of China and the Soviet Union."

Chairman Liu Shaoqi solemnly declared: "The whole world can see that in the joint struggle against imperialism and for the realization of communism, the Chinese people will always stand with the Soviet people, rain or shine. We firmly believe that the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Chinese people and the Soviet people, will forever and steadfastly protect the unity of our two parties and two peoples, just like protecting our own eyes."

Let imperialism and all reactionaries be crestfallen in the face of the unbreakable and eternal great friendship and unity between the two countries and two parties of China and the Soviet Union! The two countries and two parties of China and the Soviet Union will, with full confidence, under the great banner of Marxism-Leninism, unite more closely, shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand, and advance victoriously for our common cause!

    最亲密的兄弟　最伟大的友谊
    中国共产党中央委员会副主席、中华人民共和国主席、中国党政代表团团长刘少奇同志和中国党政代表团，应苏联共产党和苏联政府的邀请，在参加了伟大十月社会主义革命四十三周年的庆祝典礼，参加了在莫斯科举行的各国共产党和工人党代表会议、举行了中苏两党领导人的会谈之后，又在苏共中央主席团委员、苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席勃列日涅夫等同志的陪同下，在我们的兄弟盟邦——伟大的苏联进行了友好访问，受到了苏联党政领导同志和广大人民的热烈欢迎和隆重接待。以刘少奇同志为首的中国党政代表团，怀着加强中苏友谊和团结的深切愿望前往苏联，现在，他们已带着苏联人民对中国人民的兄弟情谊回到了北京。毫无疑问，刘少奇主席的这次访问，进一步巩固和发展了中苏两国人民的伟大友谊和团结，在中苏友谊史上写下了光辉灿烂的一页。
    在刘少奇主席访问苏联期间，兄弟般的苏联人民充分表达了对中国人民的深情厚谊。在莫斯科和列宁格勒，在明斯克和伊尔库次克，都像节日一样，有成千成万的人，冒着严寒和风雪，热烈欢迎中国兄弟。在中国党政代表团所到的地方，无论城市或乡村，无论在工厂或集体农庄，到处都响起“苏中两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁”的欢呼声。在伟大苏联的首都莫斯科，一万二千多人举行苏中友好群众大会，热烈欢迎刘少奇主席和中国党政代表团。基洛夫工厂的工人说：我们是兄弟，我们的友谊是永恒的友谊。加斯特罗集体农庄庄员说：我们是心心相连的，我们的友谊将不断发展。莫斯科的学生说：在世界上，河可干，山可平，但是，苏中两国人民的伟大友谊是永恒的、牢不可破的。这些出自人民内心的、热情动人的话语，深刻地表明了中苏两国人民的友谊是多么深厚而真挚，充分地显示了中苏两国人民的团结具有多么伟大的力量！
    十月革命的伟大胜利，开始了中苏两国人民友谊的新时代。中国共产党人和中国人民一直把中国革命看成是十月革命的继续，一直把苏联人民建设社会主义和共产主义的伟大成就看成是自己的榜样，一直把伟大的苏联人民看成是自己最亲密的兄弟、最可靠的朋友。四十三年以来，中国人民无时无刻不十分关注地倾听着伟大苏联人民奋勇前进的脚步声。中国人民为苏联人民在社会主义建设和卫国战争中所取得的伟大胜利而欢呼，为苏联人民在执行宏伟的七年计划、全面展开共产主义建设中所取得的巨大成就而欢呼，为苏联人民在征服宇宙方面所取得的震惊世界的成就而欢呼，为苏联人民在维护世界和平的崇高事业中所作出的伟大贡献而欢呼。中国人民把苏联人民的一切成就都看成是自己的成就，并且为这些成就而感到自豪。中国共产党和中国人民一贯忠于无产阶级国际主义的原则，把维护和加强中苏两国和中苏两党的伟大团结看作是自己的神圣责任。中国政府和人民一贯积极支持苏联政府和人民为维护世界和平而进行的努力，并永远同苏联站在一起，为世界和平和人类进步事业的胜利奋斗到底。
    中苏两国人民的友谊在两国人民坚持不懈的努力下，获得了不断的巩固和发展。中华人民共和国成立后不久，中苏两国就签订了友好同盟互助条约。十一年来，中苏两国在政治、经济和文化等方面的互助合作都取得了巨大的成就。在我国的社会主义建设中，得到了苏联的巨大的帮助。苏联政府和苏联人民坚决支持中国人民捍卫祖国主权和领土完整的斗争，苏联政府部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志曾经警告美国帝国主义：对中华人民共和国的进攻也就是对苏联的进攻。在不久前召开的第十五届联合国大会上，赫鲁晓夫同志坚决地主张恢复中国在联合国的合法权利，严正地驳斥了美国对于中国所作的无耻的诬蔑和诽谤。对于苏联政府和苏联人民给予我国的巨大援助和支持，中国人民永志不忘。
    经过四十多年千锤百炼的中苏两国人民的友谊，是整个社会主义阵营团结和整个国际共产主义运动团结的基石。中国和苏联是社会主义阵营中两个最大的国家，中国共产党和苏联共产党是国际共产主义运动中两个最大的党。中苏两国、两党的团结一致，中苏两国八亿六千万人民的团结一致，不仅对于整个社会主义阵营和整个国际共产主义运动的团结一致具有极其重要的意义，而且也必然对世界的进程发生巨大的影响。正如毛泽东同志所说的：中苏两大国人民的团结，“不但必然要影响中苏两大国的繁荣，而且必然要影响到人类的将来，影响到全世界和平与正义的胜利”。
    中苏两国和两党的伟大团结，是世界和平和人类进步事业取得胜利的重要保证，是制止帝国主义发动新战争的强大因素。因此，帝国主义和一切反动派十分痛恨这个团结，总是千方百计地阴谋加以破坏。但是，帝国主义的梦想一次又一次地成为历史的笑柄。为八十一个共产党和工人党代表会议所一致通过的声明和告世界人民书，显示了社会主义阵营和整个国际共产主义运动的团结的进一步巩固，同样，也显示了中苏两党两国团结的进一步巩固。这种建立在马克思列宁主义基础上的伟大的无产阶级国际主义团结，从刘少奇主席在苏联的访问过程中，给全世界人民留下了十分显著的不可磨灭的印象。
    对于这种团结，苏共中央主席团委员、苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席勃列日涅夫同志在白俄罗斯共产党中央、白俄罗斯共和国最高苏维埃和部长会议为我国党政代表团举行的宴会上说得好：“我们对我们的友谊给予崇高的评价。它符合苏中两国人民的愿望，并使整个社会主义阵营的团结和威力加强，在各国人民反对帝国主义侵略阴谋、争取世界和平和人类美好未来的胜利斗争中起着重大的作用。”
    刘少奇主席在莫斯科举行的苏中友好群众大会上再一次强调指出：“我们的共同敌人——以美国为首的帝国主义者总是千方百计地企图破坏中苏之间的团结。但是，就像看不到太阳从西边出来一样，他们永远也看不到中苏两个伟大的党、伟大的国家、伟大的人民之间的分离。”
    刘少奇主席庄严地宣告：“全世界都可以看到，在反对帝国主义和实现共产主义的共同斗争中，无论风里，雨里，中国人民都将永远同苏联人民站在一起。我们坚信，中国共产党和苏联共产党，中国人民和苏联人民，将像保护自己眼珠一样，永远坚定不移地保护我们两党两国人民的团结。”
    让帝国主义和一切反动派在中苏两国和两党牢不可破的、永恒的伟大友谊和团结面前垂头丧气吧！中苏两国和两党将信心百倍地，在马克思列宁主义的伟大旗帜下，更加紧密地团结起来，肩并肩，手携手，为着我们共同的事业，胜利前进！
