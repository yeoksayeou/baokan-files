Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd – Li Siguang, Chairman of the Science and Technology Association of the People's Republic of China, sent a telegram on the 3rd to All-Union Knowledge Society Chairman Semenov, Soviet Higher Education Trade Union Chairman Gorifkov, and All-Union Association for the Dissemination of Scientific Knowledge Chairman Siruianov, congratulating the Soviet Union on the successful launch of its third spaceship.

The telegram said: "We are delighted to learn that the Soviet Union has successfully launched its third spaceship carrying experimental animals into Earth's orbit, and will conduct a series of scientific explorations in the field of space physics using the scientific measurement equipment on board. This will make new contributions to the Soviet Union's science and technology, to the world's science, and to the cause of world peace. To this end, on behalf of all members of the Chinese Science and Technology Association, I would like to extend our warm congratulations to you, and through you to the Soviet scientists, Soviet engineers, and workers who have made outstanding contributions to this endeavor."

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 3rd – Scientific figures in Tianjin held a symposium today to warmly hail the successful launch of the Soviet Union's third spaceship.

The scientists attending the meeting unanimously agreed that the fact that the Soviet Union launched its third spaceship only three months after launching its second spaceship shows that Soviet scientists have mastered the laws of spaceships and have made great achievements in science and technology. Zhang Guofan, Chairman of the Tianjin Science and Technology Association, President of Tianjin University, and physicist, said that the Soviet Union's third launch of a spaceship fully demonstrates that Soviet scientists have mastered the accuracy and reliability of spaceships. The orbit of each spaceship is determined according to plan, and each launch is successful. This is an astonishing development in Soviet science and technology. Scientist He Guozhu said that the successful launch of the Soviet Union's third spaceship has further laid the foundation for human spaceflight and is a great achievement of human science and technology. He said that the third and second spaceships launched by the Soviet Union are about the same weight, but the third spaceship is slightly lower in altitude than the second, which is more conducive to detecting the impact of air density on the operation of the spaceship and providing conditions for studying ionospheric physics phenomena. Wang Weiwei, an engineer at the Hebei Provincial Meteorological Science Institute, said that the Soviet Union's three spaceship launches have all been carried out every three months, which may be because the Soviet Union's research on space meteorology is based on different seasons. Planned continuous observations achieve a more thorough and comprehensive grasp of high-altitude physical science. At the same time, it can also be said that this is an important contribution of the Soviet Union to meteorological science. Lu Kaiyun, Director of the Plant Teaching and Research Section of the Biology Department of Hebei University, said that the Soviet Union's third spaceship has once again taken living organisms into space, which will provide scientists with rich data to study how living organisms adapt to the natural conditions of high altitude.

    天津科学家座谈红色宇宙飞船发射成功的意义
    新华社3日讯　中华人民共和国科学技术协会主席李四光，3日打电报给全苏科普主席谢苗诺夫、苏联高教工会主席戈里夫柯夫和全苏科协主席西鲁扬诺夫，祝贺苏联成功地发射了第三个宇宙飞船。
    电文说：欣悉苏联成功地把载有试验动物的第三个宇宙飞船发射到地球卫星轨道，并将通过上面的科学测量设备在宇宙空间物理学方面进行一系列的科学考察，这将为苏联的科学技术事业，为世界科学事业，为世界和平事业作出新的贡献。为此，谨代表中国科协全体会员向您，并通过您向对这项工作作出卓越贡献的苏联科学家、苏联工程师和职工致以热烈的祝贺。
    新华社天津3日电　天津市科学界人士今天举行座谈会，热烈欢呼苏联发射第三个宇宙飞船成功。
    到会的科学界人士一致认为，苏联发射第三个宇宙飞船距离发射第二个宇宙飞船只有三个多月，这说明苏联的科学家已经掌握了宇宙飞船的规律，在科学技术方面取得了巨大的成就。天津市科学技术协会主席、天津大学校长、物理学家张国藩说，苏联第三次发射宇宙飞船，充分证明苏联科学家已经掌握了飞船的准确性和可靠性。每次宇宙飞船的运行轨道是按计划确定的，而且每次发射都获得成功。这是苏联科学技术的惊人发展。科学家何国柱说，苏联发射第三个宇宙飞船的成功，更进一步对人类的宇宙航行打下了基础，是人类科学技术伟大的成就。他说，苏联发射的第三个和第二个宇宙飞船重量差不多，但是第三个宇宙飞船比第二个宇宙飞船的高度低了一些，这就更有利于探测空气密度对宇宙飞船运行的影响，和为研究电离层物理现象提供条件。河北省气象科学研究所王维罴工程师说，苏联这三次宇宙飞船放射，都是每隔三个月一次，这可能是苏联对空间气象的研究根据不同的季节进行的。有计划地连续的观测，达到了更周密更全面地掌握高空物理科学。同时也可以说明这是苏联对气象科学重要的贡献。河北大学生物系植物教研室主任芦开运说，苏联的第三个宇宙飞船又带着生物上天，这将给科学家研究生物如何适应高空的自然条件提供丰富资料。
