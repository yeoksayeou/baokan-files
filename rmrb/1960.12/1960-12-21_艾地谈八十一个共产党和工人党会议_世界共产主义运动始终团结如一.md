Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 19th – D.N. Aidit, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia and Vice-Chairman of the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly, discussed the current situation in a speech at a mass meeting initiated by the Jakarta City Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia on the 18th.

Aidit said that on the one hand, we have recently achieved two great victories. The first victory is that the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly, under the leadership of three forces (referring to nationalists, Muslims, and communists), passed resolutions on the general outline of national policy and the general outline of construction plans in less than a month. This is not a victory for one group, one party, or one trend, but a victory for all Indonesian people. The second victory is that eighty-one communist and workers' parties recently reached a unity of will in Moscow, which is expressed in the form of a statement and an appeal to the people of the world.

He said that on the other hand, the imperialists, headed by the United States, are still engaged in sinful activities, continuing to prepare for new wars, and intending to continue colonial rule—the situations in Cuba, the Congo, Algeria, and Laos are evidence of this. However, compared with the material and spiritual strength of the people of the world, which is now very strong and growing stronger, these disruptive activities of the imperialists are very small and temporary. The imperialists are being hit everywhere, and they are no longer powerful.

Referring to the statement and the appeal to the people of the world by the eighty-one communist and workers' parties, Aidit said that he believed that the Communist Party of Indonesia would fully endorse these two documents. He said that these two documents demonstrate the consistent unity of the world communist movement, and they are a brilliant achievement of democratic discussion. These two documents will play a huge role in promoting and leading the struggle to achieve not only the goals of the communists but also the goals of the working class, working people, and progressive forces of all countries in the world. He said that these two documents will better mobilize the people of the world to fight for peace, liberation, and socialism, because they point out to the people of the world the root causes of the danger of war, the importance of peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition, and the possibility of stopping war and saving peace.

Aidit then pointed out that the resolutions made by the eighty-one communist and workers' parties in Moscow are directly beneficial to the struggle of the Indonesian people, because if the imperialists are hit harder and more concentratedly all over the world, then Indonesia's struggle against imperialism will be able to proceed more easily. He said that the noble ideas embodied in these two documents will inspire the Communist Party of Indonesia and the working people to fight more actively to liberate West Irian, eliminate imperialism and colonialism on Indonesian soil, and strive for peace in Asia and the world.

Aidit said that the publication of the statement and the appeal to the people of the world by the eighty-one communist and workers' parties has bankrupted the imperialists and their lackeys' illusions about the "split of the communist movement." He refuted the fallacies of the imperialists and their lackeys about provoking Sino-Soviet relations. He said that the world communist movement has not split, but on the contrary, this movement is now becoming stronger and stronger, and the imperialists and their lackeys have never been so disappointed as they are now.

Referring to the situations in the Congo, Laos, and other countries, Aidit demanded that the Indonesian government continue to recognize the legitimate government of the Congo led by Lumumba, and that the Indonesian government take over Belgian enterprises in Indonesia in accordance with the demands of Indonesian workers. He said that the Communist Party of Indonesia and the Indonesian people condemn the atrocities committed by France in Algeria. The Communist Party of Indonesia calls on the Indonesian people to continue to increase aid to the Algerian people. The Communist Party of Indonesia demands that the Indonesian government condemn the imperialist interference in Laos, headed by US imperialism; and demands that the Indonesian government use its full influence to ensure that the Geneva Accords are observed. The Communist Party of Indonesia and the Indonesian people also condemn the United States' blatant interference in Cuba.

    艾地谈八十一个共产党和工人党会议
    世界共产主义运动始终团结如一
    会议文件将更好地动员全世界人民为争取和平、解放和社会主义而斗争
    新华社雅加达19日电　印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会主席、临时人民协商会议副主席艾地18日在印度尼西亚共产党雅加达市委员会发起的群众大会上发表演说时，论述了目前的形势。
    艾地说，一方面，最近我们已经取得了两项巨大的胜利。第一项胜利是，在三种力量（指民族主义者、穆斯林和共产主义者）领导下的临时人民协商会议在不到一个月的时间内通过了关于国家政策总纲领和建设计划总纲领的决定。这不是一个集团、一个政党或一种潮流的胜利，而是全体印度尼西亚人民的胜利。第二项胜利是，八十一个共产党和工人党最近在莫斯科达成意志的统一，这是以声明和告世界人民书的形式表现出来的。
    他说，在另一方面，以美国为首的帝国主义者仍然干着罪恶的勾当，继续准备新战争，并打算继续实行殖民统治——古巴、刚果、阿尔及利亚和老挝的形势就是明证。但是，如果同目前世界非常强大和越来越强大的人民的物质和精神力量相比较，帝国主义者的这种捣乱活动是非常渺小的和暂时的。帝国主义者到处都遭到打击，他们现在不再是强大的了。
    艾地在谈到八十一个共产党和工人党的声明和告世界人民书时表示，他相信，印度尼西亚共产党将完全赞同这两个文件。他说，这两个文件显示了世界共产主义运动的始终如一的团结，它们是民主性质的讨论的光辉成就。这两个文件在促进并领导为了实现不仅是共产党人的目标而且也是全世界各国工人阶级、劳动人民和进步力量的目标的斗争方面，将起巨大的作用。他说，这两个文件将更好地动员全世界人民进行争取和平、解放和社会主义的斗争，因为它们向世界人民指出了战争危险的根源、和平共处和和平竞赛、制止战争和挽救和平的可能性的重要意义。
    艾地接着指出，八十一个共产党和工人党在莫斯科作出的决议直接有利于印度尼西亚人民的斗争，因为如果帝国主义者在全世界遭到更有力和更集中的打击，那么印度尼西亚的反对帝国主义的斗争将能够比较容易地进行。他说，这两个文件所体现的崇高思想将鼓舞印度尼西亚共产党和劳动人民更积极地进行斗争来解放西伊里安，在印度尼西亚的土地上消灭帝国主义和殖民主义，并为亚洲和全世界的和平而努力。
    艾地说，八十一个共产党和工人党的声明和告世界人民书的公布，使得帝国主义者及其走狗宣告他们关于“共产主义运动的分裂”的幻想已经破产。他驳斥了帝国主义及其走狗关于挑拨中苏关系的谬论。他说，世界共产主义运动并没有发生分裂，而是恰恰相反，这个运动现在变得越来越壮大，帝国主义者及其走狗从没有像现在这样大失所望。
    艾地在谈到刚果、老挝和其他国家的局势时要求，印度尼西亚政府继续承认卢蒙巴领导的刚果合法政府，印度尼西亚政府按照印度尼西亚工人的要求接管比利时在印度尼西亚的企业。他说，印度尼西亚共产党和印度尼西亚人民谴责法国在阿尔及利亚所犯的暴行。印度尼西亚共产党号召印度尼西亚人民继续增加对阿尔及利亚人民的援助。印度尼西亚共产党要求，印度尼西亚政府谴责以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义对老挝的干涉；要求印度尼西亚政府使用它的全部影响来使日内瓦协议得到遵守。印度尼西亚共产党和印度尼西亚人民还谴责美国粗暴地干涉古巴。
