Rationally Distribute Livestock Pens to Save Labor
Hongqi Brigade of Jingbei Commune grinds grain on the mountain fields, feeds livestock with hay on the spot, and applies manure fertilizer on the spot, improving mountain and plateau land and increasing unit yield.

(Our report) The Hongqi Brigade of Jingbei Commune in Jingyuan County, Ningxia, has unified planning for river valley, mountain, and plateau land, rationally distributing livestock pens and grain threshing grounds. Livestock are used, grazed, and fed locally, animal manure is processed, transported, and applied locally, grain is threshed locally, and hay is stored locally. This eliminates the need for travel back and forth between the mountains and the plains, which not only saves a large amount of labor and animal power, but also fundamentally solves the fertilizer problem, providing favorable conditions for transforming barren mountain and plateau farmland.

The Hongqi Brigade is a brigade located close to the Guan Mountains. Of the brigade's more than 5,400 mu of cultivated land, only 1,292 mu are in river valleys, with the rest being mountain and plateau land. Mountain and plateau land located more than one li from the village accounts for 60%, with the farthest being more than four li away. In the past, livestock pens and threshing grounds were concentrated in the village and on the plains, which caused many inconveniences for production and resulted in a great waste of labor and animal power. From the First Team to the stone embankment on the big mountain slope, it was two li away, requiring crossing a ditch and climbing a platform, with a very steep slope. When delivering manure, a strong laborer could only carry forty or fifty jin per trip, and seven or eight trips a day would only amount to three or four hundred jin. Nanliang was closest to the village, only half a li away, but using three oxen to pull a cart could only deliver about 10,000 jin of manure a day. As a result, transporting manure before sowing each year required a large amount of labor and animal power. Sometimes transportation could not keep up, and even if there was manure, it could not be applied to the land. The amount of fertilizer applied to mountain and plateau land was far less than that applied to river valley land, with the fertilized area of mountain land accounting for only about 20% of the entire brigade, with only about 2,000 jin of fertilizer applied per mu. Therefore, mountain land became increasingly barren, and many fields had to be left fallow for a year after being cultivated for two or three years. Every time the grain harvest was completed, it took a great deal of effort to bring the crops back. The cultivated land on Dongyuan of the Fourth Team was four li away from the village. Although it was downhill, the slope was steep (over 40 degrees), and it was dangerous to load more than 800 jin on an ox cart, so it could only be moved slowly, and a person could only carry fifty or sixty jin per trip. Consequently, it took a month after each harvest for all the grain to be brought to the threshing ground.

In 1956, after the establishment of the advanced agricultural cooperative, Yu Fugui, the Party branch secretary, and the masses studied together: "Since it is so difficult to carry manure uphill and transport crops downhill, why not move the threshing grounds and livestock pens up there?" The following spring, they established two threshing grounds and livestock pens on the plateau, which proved to be very convenient. With the development of agricultural production, higher demands were placed on cultivation, and labor became increasingly scarce. Last year, in order to fundamentally solve this contradiction, the Party branch conducted unified planning based on the crop layout, production needs, and other conditions of river valley, mountain, and plateau land, and moved most of the brigade's livestock pens and threshing grounds to the mountains and plateaus. At present, the five teams have established five livestock pens, five threshing grounds, and one sheepfold on the mountain and plateau land, which accounts for about three-quarters of the brigade's cultivated land. Sixty-nine of the one hundred and eight draft cattle are raised on the mountain, and four donkeys and a flock of sheep are also raised on the mountain. The river valley land, which accounts for one-quarter of the cultivated area, is mainly planted with high-yield crops such as foreign wheat, potatoes, corn, and vegetables, which require a large amount of fertilizer and meticulous cultivation. In order to ensure the successful cultivation of high-yield crops, three livestock pens, three threshing grounds, and two sheepfolds have been distributed on the river valley land, which, together with human manure and urine, kang soil fertilizer, etc., can meet the fertilizer needs of these fields. After this rational layout, the previous unreasonable production process and the inability to fertilize the remote mountain and barren land have been greatly changed. This year, except for nearly 500 mu of land on Nanshan, which is too far from the village and has not yet established a livestock pen, all of the more than 3,600 mu of plateau and mountain land have been fertilized, generally increasing the amount applied to about 3,000 jin per mu. The application of high-quality pen manure to the mountain land has gradually cultivated soil fertility and increased yields. Originally, potatoes were only planted on river valley land. This year, the First Team planted 78 mu of potatoes on the mountain. Due to the sufficient application of base fertilizer and seedling fertilizer, the yield of mountain potatoes reached 619 jin per mu. At present, the livestock pens and sheepfolds on the mountain have accumulated more than 11,000 cartloads of good manure for next year. In addition, there are a large amount of green manure and miscellaneous manure being composted. After this winter's accumulation, it will be possible to meet the need for applying 4,000 jin of fertilizer per mu to the plateau land and 3,000 jin per mu to the mountain land next year. This year, hundreds of thousands of jin of hay from the mountains and plateaus did not need to be transported downhill because they were fed to livestock on the spot. This year's more than 70,000 jin of public grain were directly delivered to the state granary from the threshing ground, saving a large amount of transportation power.

The newly built livestock pens and threshing grounds of the Hongqi Brigade are planned with a long-term perspective, gradually improving from simple to complete. All five livestock pens have selected locations that are centrally located, sunny, sheltered from the wind, and convenient for obtaining soil for bedding. A total of twenty-five rooms have been built. Each point has "three grounds, one pen, and one shed," in addition to a livestock pen and a grain threshing ground, there are also a dry soil ground, a manure ground, and a hay shed. The dry soil ground is used for drying soil for bedding; the manure ground is used for storing manure and soil; and the hay shed is used for storing hay and some heavier agricultural tools. The keepers have dormitories and warm kangs. In order to solve the water problem, two new water storage dams have been built and two springs have been repaired since the livestock pens were moved to the mountain.

    合理分布场地畜圈节约劳动力
    泾北公社红旗大队山地粮食就地打碾，干草就地饲畜，粪肥就地施用，改良了山地、塬地，提高了单位产量
    本报讯　宁夏泾源县泾北公社红旗大队，将川、山、塬地进行统一规划，合理分布畜圈和打粮场，牲畜就地使役、放牧、饲养，畜粪就地加工、拉运施用，粮食就地打碾，干草就地贮放，无需山上山下往返，不仅能节约大批劳畜力，而且从根本上解决了肥料问题，对改造山、塬瘠薄耕地提供了有利条件。
    红旗大队是一个紧靠关山的大队，全队五千四百多亩耕地中，仅有川地一千二百九十二亩，其余都是山地、塬地。离庄一里以上的山地、塬地占60％，最远的有四里多路。过去，圈、场都集中在庄子上和平川地，给生产带来很多不便，劳畜力的浪费很大。从一小队到大山坡上的石头埝子，有二里路，要过一道沟，上一座台，坡度很陡，送粪时一个壮劳力一回只能担四、五十斤，一天担七、八趟才三、四百斤。南梁离庄子最近，只半里路，用三头牛拉一辆车，一天也只能送粪一万斤左右。这样，每年播种前送粪总要拖住大量劳力、畜力，有时拉运不及，有粪也施不到地里；山地、塬地施肥量远不如川地，全大队山地施肥面积只占20％左右，每亩仅施肥两千斤。因此，山地愈种愈薄，不少地种两三年就要歇一年。每到粮食收割完毕，往回拿庄稼又要付出很大力量。四小队东塬的耕地离庄四里，虽是下坡，但坡陡（四十度以上），牛车一车装八百多斤，就有危险，只能慢走，人背一趟也只能背五、六十斤。因而，每年收割后一个月，粮食才能全部拿到场上。
    1956年，这里成立高级农业社以后，党支部书记余福贵和群众一起研究：“既然往上担粪，往下拿庄稼那么费力，为什么不把场和圈移上去呢？”第二年春天，他们在塬地上建立了两处场、圈，果然非常方便。随着农业生产的发展，在耕作上提出了更高的要求，劳力也日益显得不足。去年，为了从根本上解决这一矛盾，党支部根据川、山、塬地的作物布局、生产需要和其他条件，进行了统一规划，把大队的大部分圈、场都迁移山上、塬上。目前，五个小队已在占全队耕地四分之三左右的山、塬地上，建立了五个畜圈、五处场、一所羊圈，一百零八头耕牛已有六十九头上山饲养，还有四头驴、一群羊也在山上饲养。占耕地面积四分之一的川地，以种植高产作物洋麦、洋芋、玉米以及蔬菜为主，需肥量大，务作精细。为了保证种好高产作物，在川地上分布了三所畜圈、三个场、两所羊圈，再加上庄内人粪尿、炕土肥等，可以满足这些地对肥料的需要。经过这样合理布局以后，大大改变了过去不合理的生产过程和对远山薄地无力上粪的情况。今年，除了离庄太远、还没建立畜圈的南山近五百亩地没有上粪外，三千六百多亩塬地、山地全部上了粪，一般每亩增施到三千斤左右。山地施了优质圈粪，逐步培养了地力，提高了产量。原来洋芋只种在川地上，今年一小队在山上种的七十八亩洋芋由于底肥和苗肥施的足，今年山地洋芋亩产六百一十九斤。目前，山上畜圈、羊圈又已经为明年积下好粪一万一千多车，另外，还有沤制的大量绿肥和杂粪。再经今年一冬的积攒，就可以满足明年塬地每亩施肥四千斤、山地亩施三千斤的需要。今年山、塬地好几十万斤干草，由于就地喂了牲畜，不需往下搬运。今年的七万多斤公粮，从场上直接送交国家粮库，节约了大批运输力。
    红旗大队新建的圈、场，都从长远着想，由简单到完备，逐步提高。五处畜圈都选择了地点适中、向阳避风、便于取土垫圈的地方，共盖了二十五间房屋。每一个点上都有“三场、一圈、一棚”，除了畜圈、粮食场外，并有干土场、粪场和干草棚。干土场晾土垫圈；粪场压存粪土；干草棚贮放干草和一些较重的农具。饲养员有宿舍、暖炕。为了解决用水问题，自从畜圈上山以后，又新建涝坝两座，修泉两处。
