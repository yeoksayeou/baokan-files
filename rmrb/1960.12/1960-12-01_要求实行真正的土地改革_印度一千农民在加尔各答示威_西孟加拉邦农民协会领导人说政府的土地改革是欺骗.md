Xinhua News Agency, 29th Dispatch from Calcutta: Approximately one thousand farmer representatives from various districts of West Bengal, India, held a demonstration in Calcutta on the 22nd, demanding genuine land reform. This demonstration was initiated by the West Bengal Farmers Association.

According to the Amrita Bazar Patrika, these farmer representatives marched through the streets of Calcutta. They were blocked by the police on their way to the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, and only two leaders were allowed to enter the Assembly to present their demands.

Later, these farmer representatives held a general meeting in the city. Jyoti Basu, Bankim Mukherjee, and Harekrishna Konar, leaders of the Communist Party of India in West Bengal, spoke at the meeting.

According to the Liberty, farmers also held demonstrations in various districts and localities of West Bengal, demanding genuine land reform.

On the eve of the farmers' demonstration, Ranan Sen, Vice Chairman of the West Bengal Trade Union Congress, issued a statement calling on the working class of the state to stand with the farmers and fully support their just struggle for genuine land reform. The statement said, "The sympathy and assistance of the organized working class for the farmers is most urgently needed, and this is also the great task of the working class." The Liberty also published an editorial calling on workers, students, and progressive democratic forces in Calcutta to stand with the farmers.

According to a report in The Statesman on the 19th, leaders of the West Bengal Farmers Association earlier condemned the Indian government's land reform as a "deception" that is "reducing tenants who pay rent in kind to the status of serfs."

    新华社29日讯　加尔各答消息：来自印度西孟加拉邦各县的大约一千名农民代表22日在加尔各答举行示威，要求实行真正的土地改革。这一示威是由西孟加拉邦农民协会发起的。
    据《甘露市场报》报道，这些农民代表在加尔各答市的街道上游行。他们在前往西孟加拉邦议会的路上遭到警察的阻拦，只有两名领导人被允许进入议会提出他们的要求。
    后来，这些农民代表在市内举行大会。印度共产党西孟加拉邦领导人乔蒂·巴苏、班基姆·穆克吉和哈雷克里希纳·科纳在大会上讲了话。
    据《自由报》报道，在西孟加拉邦各县和各地，农民们也举行了示威，要求实行真正的土地改革。
    在农民示威前夕，西孟加拉邦工会大会副主席拉南·森发表声明，号召这个邦的工人阶级站在农民一边，全力支持农民们要求实行真正的土地改革的正义斗争。声明说，“有组织的工人阶级对农民们的同情和援助是最迫切需要的，这也是工人阶级的伟大任务。”《自由报》还发表社论，号召加尔各答的工人、学生和进步民主力量站在农民一边。
    据《政治家报》19日报道，西孟加拉邦农民协会的领导人早些时候曾谴责印度政府的土地改革是一种“欺骗”，它使“交实物地租的佃户正在降低到农奴的地位”。
