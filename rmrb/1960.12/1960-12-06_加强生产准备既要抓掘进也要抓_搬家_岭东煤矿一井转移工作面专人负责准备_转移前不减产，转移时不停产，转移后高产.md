Xinhua News Agency, Shuangyashan, 5th - Lingdong Coal Mine No. 1 Well in Shuangyashan, during the high-yield competition, organized a special team to prepare for "moving" the working face (transferring the working face), achieving both "moving" and increased production. Since November, six working faces in this well have been "moved." If the preparation work for moving was still done by the coal miners themselves, as in the past, coal production would have been reduced by at least 2,000 tons. Now, with a dedicated production preparation team preparing the new working faces in advance, these six working faces not only did not reduce production during the "moving" process, but also increased production by more than 1,200 tons, creating a new achievement of no production reduction before "moving," no stoppage during "moving," and high production after "moving."

The method of Lingdong Coal Mine No. 1 Well organizing a working face "moving" preparation team was gradually explored by the well's leadership. In the past, like other wells, the preparation work for moving the working face was done by the coal miners themselves, and each move would reduce production. This situation gradually made the leaders of No. 1 Well realize that strengthening production preparation should not only focus on tunneling but also on "moving." Therefore, they were determined to draw more than sixty people from coal mining, tunneling, transportation, and electrical and mechanical trades to form a fixed production preparation team dedicated to carrying out "moving" preparation work.

The working face moving preparation team is not only a vanguard for preparing new working faces but also a "logistics department" for cleaning up old working faces. The benefit of this approach is just as coal miner Liu Guoshun said: "With the moving preparation team paving the way for us and cleaning up the old base, we can concentrate on striving for high production." For example, when the Fourth Coal Mining Team moved on November 5th, the preparation team had prepared the roadway of the new working face on the 4th, installed the wires, and laid the electric chute and transport track. They invited the coal mining team leader, group leader, and veteran workers to the new working face for acceptance and trial production. After moving on the 5th, the first day's raw coal output increased by 21.5% compared with the average daily output of the previous month.

    加强生产准备既要抓掘进也要抓“搬家”
    岭东煤矿一井转移工作面专人负责准备
    转移前不减产，转移时不停产，转移后高产
    新华社双鸭山5日电　双鸭山岭东煤矿一井在高产竞赛中组织专门队伍进行掌子面“搬家”（转移工作面）的准备工作，作到了“搬家”又增产。11月份以来，这个井有六个掌子面“搬家”，如果仍像过去一样由采煤工人自己来做搬家准备工作，至少要减产煤炭两千吨；现在由专门的生产准备队事先把新掌子准备妥当，就使这六个掌子面在“搬家”过程中不仅没有减产，反而增产了一千二百多吨煤炭，创造了“搬家”前不减产，搬家时不停产，搬家后高产的新成就。
    岭东煤矿一井组织掌子面“搬家”准备工作队的作法，是这个井的领导逐步摸索出来的。过去他们也同其他井一样，掌子面搬家的准备工作是由采煤工人自己来做的，每次搬家都要减产。这种情况使一井领导逐渐认识到加强生产准备不仅要大抓掘进工作，而且要大抓“搬家”。因此，他们下定决心由采煤、掘进、运输、机电等工种中抽调出六十多人，组成了固定的生产准备队，专门负责进行“搬家”准备工作。
    掌子面搬家准备工作队既是准备新掌子面的尖兵，又是清理旧掌子面的“后勤部”。这种做法的好处正如采煤工人刘国顺所说：“有了搬家准备队给我们打前站和清理老底，我们就能安心夺高产”。例如，第四采煤队11月5日搬家时，准备队4日就把新掌子面的巷道作好，电线架好，电溜子和运输轨道铺好，请采煤队长、组长、老工人一起到新掌子面去验收试生产，5日搬家后，第一天的原煤产量就比上月平均日产量提高了21.5％。
