    The Riga Institute of Electronics and Computing Technology recently successfully conducted the first batch of experiments using an electronic computer to automatically translate scientific literature from Russian into Latvian. The experiment used an original electronic computer built by the Latvian Academy of Sciences.

    When this machine works, the text to be translated is first translated into a code and punched on paper tape. The machine can then determine the part of speech of the vocabulary according to an automated dictionary, and determine the number and case of nouns, the conjugation of verbs, etc., according to the corresponding rules. The analysis of Russian vocabulary and the composition of Latvian vocabulary are both done in this way. Finally, the machine can record the translated material with a typewriter.

    A group of Ukrainian engineers has designed an oxygen drilling device that uses fire to mine.

    This device can spray a stream of fire as high as 3,000 degrees, and by aiming the fire at the ore, it can burn the ore down at a speed of eight meters per second. Mechanical rock drills can only excavate three to four meters every six hours.

    There are already several fire drilling devices working in the Krivoy Rog mining area.

    A metallurgical plant in Cherepovets recently manufactured a coke dry quenching device with huge production efficiency, which is one to two times higher than the most efficient unit manufactured by foreign companies.

    In this device, the incandescent coke is cooled in a vertical chamber using inert gas. At the same time, the gas heated to 700 degrees can also be reused to heat water. This device can produce 50 tons of steam at 40 atmospheres per hour. This steam can be used by steam turbine generators to generate electricity for production and civilian use.

    The new device can also improve the strength of coke.

    Experts in Moscow have designed a valuable instrument for studying swimming techniques. This instrument can be used to effectively study the most important aspects of a swimmer's movements, thereby helping swimmers improve their technique.

    This instrument is very small and weighs only eight kilograms. Its working principle is to use electricity to measure changes in water pressure on a certain part of the swimmer's body to understand the characteristics of the swimmer's movements. It can also be used to study any other movements completed underwater nearby. Experts believe that it is also very useful for studying biomechanics and exercise physiology.

    里加电子学和计算技术研究所最近成功地进行了用电子计算机把科学文献从俄语自动译成拉脱维亚语的第一批试验。试验使用的是拉脱维亚科学院建造的一台独创的电子计算机。
    在这台机器进行工作时，首先将要翻译的文字译成电码，在纸带上作孔。机器就可以根据自动化辞典确定词汇的词性，根据相应的规则确定名词的数和格、动词的变位等等。对俄语词汇的分析和对拉脱维亚语词汇的构成都是用这种方法进行的。最后机器可以把译出的材料用打字机记录下来。

    一批乌克兰工程师设计了一种氧钻装置，利用火力来采矿。
    这种装置可以喷出一股温度高达三千度的火，把火对准矿石，它就可以用每秒八米的速度把矿石烧下来。而机械凿岩机每六小时才只能掘进三到四米。
    现在在克里沃罗格矿区已经有好几台火钻装置在工作了。

    切列波维次一家冶金工厂前不久制成了一座生产效率巨大的焦炭干熄装置，其生产效率比外国公司制造的生产效率最高的机组还要高一两倍。
    在这个装置中，炽热的焦煤是在竖室中利用惰性气体来冷却的。同时，加热到七百度的气体还可以再次利用来加热水。这个装置每小时可以生产四十个大气压的蒸汽五十吨。这些蒸汽可供汽轮发电机用来发电，以供生产使用和民用。
    新装置还可以提高焦炭的强度。

    莫斯科的专家们设计了一种用来研究游泳技术的珍贵的仪器。利用这种仪器可以有效地研究游泳者动作的最重要的方面，从而可以帮助游泳者提高技术。
    这种仪器十分小巧，重仅八公斤。它的工作原理是，利用电力测量游泳者身体某一部分的水的压力的变化，以了解游泳者动作的特征。它还可以用来研究其它附近任何在水下完成的动作。专家认为，它对研究生物力学和运动生理学也是很有用的。
