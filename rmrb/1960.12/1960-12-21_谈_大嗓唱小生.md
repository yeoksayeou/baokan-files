On "Singing Xiaosheng with a Big Voice" by Liu Hao

After the Chinese Art Troupe that visited Latin America and Canada returned to China, it held a reporting performance in Beijing. There was a new attempt in the performed Peking Opera: in the *Legend of the White Snake*, performed jointly by comrades Li Shaochun, Yuan Shihai, and Du Jinfang, Li Shaochun played Xu Xian, dressed as a xiaosheng, but instead of using the usual xiaosheng small-voice singing style, he sang with the singing style of a laosheng. This kind of singing made people feel that the expression was natural, the sound was round, thick and pleasant to the ear, and there was no awkward feeling. Therefore, I think that this not only caters to the appreciation tastes of foreign audiences, but also our Chinese audiences welcome it! Speaking of it, this should be said to be an attempt to develop and innovate Peking Opera art with courage. Such an attempt has positive significance.

Of course, this is not to say that it should replace the usual xiaosheng small-voice singing style, but rather to regard it as an enrichment of the xiaosheng singing style, so that xiaosheng repertoire has one more way of expression in singing. Having one more singing style is better than having one less; having this kind of singing style allows the audience to have more choices. If you like to listen, then listen; if you don't like to listen, then don't listen. If you like to listen to one kind but are not satisfied, then there are two kinds to listen to. Therefore, we must thank them for their efforts.

Affirming this kind of singing does not mean that we want to abolish the roles. Because we all know that, first, the division of Chinese opera into sheng, dan, jing, chou, etc. is not limited to Peking Opera; various other local operas are also like this; only the names are slightly different, and the number of roles varies. Second, the formation of roles has a long history. As early as the Yuan Dynasty zaju, there were distinctions such as "zhengmo, chongmo, xiaomo, wai, zhengdan, laodan, waidan, chadan, jing, chou, za...". Although today's roles are different from those at that time, it can also be seen that its origins are profound and far-reaching. Third, the reason why opera forms roles is probably because opera, as an art, is always a reflection of real life, but it has also been refined and processed, and is not completely the same as the natural form of life. Therefore, to shape characters and portray personalities, it is necessary to unify both reflecting real life and being different from the natural form of life. Thus, generations of opera artists have generalized and concentrated the characters based on the conditions and characteristics of the identity, age, personality, and temperament of numerous characters, and made a rough classification, creating various character shapes, called: sheng, dan, jing, chou... For hundreds of years, these various character shapes such as sheng, dan, jing, chou have gradually formed their own unique performance, singing, and makeup art in the development process of opera. Although there are still some contradictions to be resolved when these are used to express modern life, generally speaking, they play a great role in expressing the theme of the script, shaping character images, and highlighting character characteristics. Fourth, the formation and development of roles not only shows that Chinese opera has its own unique artistic style, but also that the technology is superb and very rich. Even if an actor studies hard and practices diligently throughout his life, it is impossible to fully master the performance skills of various roles. He can only lay a foundation when practicing basic skills in his childhood, and then specialize in one or two roles on that foundation. From the above, it can be seen that the formation and development of roles is universal, long-standing, and has its objective reasons in opera. Whether it is the development of opera art itself, the actual possibility for actors to master performance skills, or the aesthetic habits of the people, all require the existence of roles. Taking the "xiaosheng role" as an example, perhaps some audiences are not accustomed to the small-voice singing style, and even feel awkward, but it has its own unique features in shaping character images. Other roles naturally also have their own unique strengths. Therefore, we not only do not demand the abolition of this role, but also resolutely oppose taking a blanket abolition attitude towards roles, and advocate that this part of the artistic heritage should be carefully studied, critically inherited and developed.

However, the outstanding performing art masters of all ages are proficient in roles, but not bound by them. They always master the most skilled performance skills of a certain role, and can also draw on the strengths of others, break through prejudices, and create and develop, forming their own unique style in the contemporary era. This attempt by Comrade Li Shaochun is certainly not enough to talk about forming his own unique style. However, if we look at the various roles he has played and the various types of character images he has created, such as Lin Xiangru in *Generals and Ministers at Peace*, Lin Chong in *Wild Boar Forest*, Sun Wukong in *Havoc in Heaven*, and Yang Bailao in *The White-Haired Girl*, his acting skills can be described as "versatile in all kinds of repertoire." This shows that Comrade Li Shaochun's artistic development prospects are really broad. Therefore, we should express our warm welcome and actively support this kind of attempt he has made, and even any new attempt or new development by anyone, even if it is only a little bit. In fact, it has long been the case that xiaosheng roles are not sung in small voices. In some local operas, there is no lack of precedent. Even in Peking Opera, it is not the first time. Comrade Tian Han said this in his article *The Fighting Performing Artist - Zhou Xinfang*: "Mr. Zhou is not only good at learning from brother opera genres, but also good at learning from roles outside his own genre. In addition to civil and military laosheng, he also often plays big-voice xiaosheng, such as Su Qin, Zhang Liang, and Han Xin, etc." However, Zhou Xinfang's use of a big voice to sing xiaosheng before liberation did not receive more enthusiastic support. It is said that some people agreed at the time, but some people opposed it. It can be seen that it is indeed not easy to make a bold attempt in artistic practice. Therefore, it is even more important and valuable to give encouragement and support to practitioners, so that they can muster the courage, build confidence, and be able to continuously carry out various creative attempts.

Speaking of support, it must be mentioned that the director and fellow actors cooperated with Comrade Li Shaochun. This is the most practical and powerful support, and it is also a manifestation of everyone's shared aspirations to innovate with courage. Therefore, in a sense, this attempt has the nature of collective creation. Such mutual cooperation and mutual support is of the utmost importance.

When we express our gratitude for this performance, we are even more grateful for the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, a hundred schools of thought contend, and bringing forth the new through the old, put forward by our Party and Chairman Mao. Under the guidance of this policy, who can guess how many new and beautiful arts the artists will create for you to see! However, it is foreseeable that more and more such new and beautiful artistic products and artistic styles will continue to emerge. (Attached picture)

### 谈“大嗓唱小生”

    谈“大嗓唱小生”刘皓
    我国赴拉丁美洲及加拿大访问演出艺术团回国后，在北京举行了汇报演出，演出的京剧中有了新的尝试，那就是在李少春、袁世海、杜近芳等同志合演的《白蛇传》中，李少春同志饰许仙，作小生扮，却不用小生惯用的小嗓唱法而用老生的唱法演唱。这样唱法，使人听来，觉得表情自如，圆厚悦耳，并没有什么别扭之感。所以我想，这不仅是适应外国观众的欣赏趣味，我们中国的观众又何尝不欢迎！讲起来，这应该说是他们勇于发展、勇于革新京剧艺术的一种尝试。这样的尝试，是有积极意义的。
    当然，并不是说要以它去代替小生惯用的小嗓唱法，不过是把它看作对于小生唱法的一种丰富，使小生应工戏在演唱上又多了一种表现方法。多一种唱法似比少一种唱法强；多出来这样一种唱法，就使观众更加有了选择的余地，不是你爱听就去听，不爱听就甭去听；而是你爱听哪一种去听哪一种，听一种还不满足的话，就有两种可听了。因此，我们得感谢他们所作的努力。
    肯定这样唱法，更不意味着要取消行当。因为我们都知道，第一，中国戏曲之有生、旦、净、丑等行当之分，不仅限于京剧，其它各种地方戏曲也这样；只是名目大同小异，行当有多有少。第二，行当的形成，由来已久，早在元杂剧中，就有“正末、冲末、小末、外、正旦、老旦、外旦、搽旦、净、丑、杂……”等分别。尽管今天的行当与那时的不同，但也可以看到它渊源之深远。第三，戏曲之所以形成行当，大概是由于戏曲作为一种艺术，它总是现实生活的反映，但又经过了提炼加工，与生活的自然形态不尽相同，因此，塑造人物，刻划性格，就须把既要反映现实生活、而又与生活的自然形态不同这两者统一起来。于是，历代的戏曲艺术家们遂根据众多角色的身份、年龄、性格、气质等条件和特征，对人物形象加以概括集中，作了大体的分类，创造出了各类人物造型，称作：生、旦、净、丑……。几百年来，这生、旦、净、丑等各种人物造型，在戏曲发展过程中，渐渐形成了各自独特的表演、歌唱和化妆艺术。这些，用来表现现代生活，虽然还存在若干矛盾需要解决，但一般说来，对于表现剧本主题思想，塑造人物形象，突出人物性格特征，都起着很大的作用。第四，行当的形成和发展，不仅表明我国戏曲有其独特的艺术风格，而且技术高超，非常丰富。一个演员即使是毕生勤学苦练，也不可能完全掌握各种行当的表演技巧，只能是在幼年练习基本功时，打好一个基础，在那基础之上，再专精一行或两行。从上述种种可见，行当的形成与发展，在戏曲中是普遍的，久远的，并有其客观原因的，无论戏曲艺术本身的发展，和演员掌握表演技巧的实际可能，以及人民群众的欣赏习惯，都是需要行当存在的。以“小生行”而论，也许有些观众对于小嗓唱法不太习惯，甚至感到别扭，但它在塑造人物形象，却有其独特之处。其它各种行当，自然也都独具特长。所以我们不仅不要求取消这个行当，而且坚决反对对行当采取一概取消的态度，主张对于这部分艺术遗产要认真地加以研究，批判地继承和发扬。
    但是，历代的杰出的表演艺术大师，都是精通行当，又不拘泥于行当，他们总是既掌握了某一行当的最熟练的表演技巧，又能博采众长，突破成见，有所创造和发展，在当代独树一帜，自成一派。李少春同志的这一点尝试，当然还谈不到独树一帜，自成一派。但是，我们若是从他所饰演的各种角色、创造的各种类型的人物形象如《将相和》中的蔺相如、《野猪林》中的林冲、《闹天宫》中的孙悟空、《白毛女》中的杨白劳等等来看，他的演技，真可谓“文武昆乱不挡”。这就可以看出，李少春同志的艺术发展前途，实在宽广得很。因此我们对于他所做的这种尝试，乃至任何人的任何新尝试，新发展，哪怕是一点点儿，都应该表示热情欢迎，积极支持。饰演小生，不用小嗓唱，其实早已有之。在某些地方戏中，既不乏先例，即在京剧方面，也不算是破题儿第一遭。田汉同志在他的《战斗的表演艺术家——周信芳》一文中这样说：“周先生不但善于跟兄弟剧种学习，也善于向本行以外的行当学习。他自己除文武老生之外也常演大嗓小生。如苏秦、张良、韩信等。”但是，周信芳同志在解放前，用大嗓唱小生，却没有能够得到更多的热情的支持，据说，当时有人赞成，却也有人反对。可见在艺术实践中要想作一点大胆的尝试，确实并不容易。那么，给实践者以鼓励和支持，使他们鼓起勇气，建立信心，能够不断地进行各种创造性的尝试，就愈发显得重要可贵了。
    说到支持，必须一提的，是导演和同台演员们与李少春同志的合作。这是最实际、最有力的支持，也是大家勇于革新的志同道合的表现。因而，在某种意义上来说，这种尝试带有集体创造的性质。这样的相互合作，彼此支持，是最关重要的。
    我们在对这次演出表示感谢的时候，更感激我们党和毛主席所提出的百花齐放、百家争鸣和推陈出新的方针政策。在这个方针政策的指示下，谁能猜想得到，艺术家们将创造出多少什么样的又新又美的艺术让你看！但是，必然会不断地涌现出更多的这样那样的又新又美的艺术产品、艺术样式，则是可以料定的。（附图片）
