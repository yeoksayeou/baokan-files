    I Became Friends with Luo Xinglan
    Lin Xiyun, Secretary of the Huazhang Commune Party Committee, Luocheng, Guangxi
    After going deep into the front lines, I made many friends. One of them is Luo Xinglan, the captain of the Chongyao Production Team of the Daliao Brigade, who is 47 years old this year.
    I met Luo Xinglan during the busiest time of rice transplanting this spring. In the Daliao Brigade, the Chongyao Production Team is a relatively central location. There are few people and a lot of land here, and the task of transplanting rice is heavy, so I chose this place as my base. Initially, I carried my luggage to this team and settled down in the home of poor peasant Wei Yangcai. That evening, we held a meeting of production team members to discuss rice transplanting. The next morning, we went to the fields together. While transplanting rice, Luo Xinglan and I worked side by side. Luo Xinglan is a very diligent and hardworking person. After going to the fields, he rarely raises his head and keeps transplanting non-stop. He urges those team members who are a little slow, regardless of what the team members are thinking or what difficulties they are facing. I thought: The old captain is an honest and hardworking person, but he may not be very good at ideological work and I should talk to him. After finishing work and returning home that day, I went to Luo Xinglan's house again. While discussing the work for the next day with him, I consciously said a few words: "No matter what work you do, as long as you let the team members understand why they should do it, the team members will consciously take action actively; otherwise, the team members won't know what's going on and they won't be able to fully exert their enthusiasm." Although I did not mention his impatient mood during the rice transplanting that day, he understood everything. He said a little embarrassedly: "You are right, I don't understand this point. I hope you will help me more in the future." That night, we talked heart to heart like old friends. We talked about the benefits of the overproduction reward policy, and also about the future harvest... We talked until late at night. Xinglan was very excited and said: "Old Lin, to be honest, no one has ever talked to me so frankly before!"
    Seeing that I cared about him, Luo Xinglan trusted me even more. He promptly reported to me whatever work, difficulties, or thoughts the team members had. I originally lived in Wei Yangcai's house, but one day, he told Wei Yangcai's wife: "Let Old Lin come and live in my house. It doesn't matter if the place is a bit narrow. It's convenient to discuss work. It's too far away here." Without asking for my opinion, he moved my luggage to his house.

    我和罗星兰交上了朋友
    广西罗城华张公社党委书记　林稀云
    我深入第一线后，交了许多朋友。其中有一个朋友叫罗星兰，是大料大队冲尧生产队的队长，今年四十七岁。
    我和罗星兰认识，是在今年春季插秧最紧张的时候。在大料大队，冲尧生产队是个较为中心的地方，这里人少田多，插秧任务重，于是我选择了这里作为落脚点。起初，我背着行李到这个队来，落户在贫农韦扬才家。当晚，我们开了个生产队社员会，研究插秧问题。第二天早上，就和他们一块下田。插秧时，我和罗星兰并排着干。罗星兰是个很勤奋肯干的人，下田后很少抬起头来，一直插个不停。有些社员动作慢点，他就一股劲催，也不管社员心里怎么想，碰到了什么困难。我想：老队长是个老实肯干的人，可能还不大会做思想工作，应该和他谈谈。这天收工回家后，我又上门去找罗星兰。在和他研究第二天的活路时，我有意识地说了几句：“无论做什么工作，只要让社员明白了为什么要做，社员就会自觉地积极行动起来；要不，社员摸不着头尾，就不能充分发挥积极性。”我虽然没有提到他在当天插秧时的急躁情绪，可是他全都明白了。他有些不好意思地说：“你讲得对，我就不懂得这点，希望你以后多帮助。”这天夜里，我们就像熟朋友似地，促膝谈起心来。谈超产奖励政策的好处，也谈未来的丰收……一直谈到深夜。星兰很兴奋，说：“老林呀，说实在的，过去还没有谁和我这么畅心地谈过呢！”
    罗星兰见我关心他，更加信任了我。无论什么工作，有什么困难，社员的思想等等都向我及时反映。我原来是住在韦扬才家的，一天，他告诉韦扬才的老婆说：“让老林到我家去住吧，地方窄点不要紧，研究工作方便，在你这里距离太远了。”没有征求我的意见，便把我的行李搬到他家去了。
