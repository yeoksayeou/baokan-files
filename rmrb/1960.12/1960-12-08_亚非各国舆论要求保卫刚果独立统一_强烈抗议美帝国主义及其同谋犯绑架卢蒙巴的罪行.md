Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 6th: The Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization issued a statement here today condemning the crime of imperialism and its agents in kidnapping Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba.

The organization also sent telegrams today to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld and US President Eisenhower, strongly protesting the illegal and brutal treatment of Prime Minister Lumumba and his colleagues, and stating that the United States, other imperialist countries, and the United Nations are directly responsible for their safety.

The statement said, "The regrettable events in the Congo have aroused the indignation of world public opinion, especially in the Asian-African world." The statement criticized the role played by the United Nations in the colonial conspiracies carried out by imperialism, and pointed out that "the purpose of these conspiracies is to undermine the independence of the Congo and paralyze the Lumumba government, the only legitimate authority of the free Congolese people."

The statement concluded by saying that the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization urgently requests the people and governments of Asian and African countries, as well as all freedom-loving countries and their people, to continue to firmly support the legitimate government of Lumumba and immediately take practical measures to achieve this goal.

Xinhua News Agency, Accra, December 6th: The Secretary-General of the All-African People's Conference, Abdoulaye Diallo, issued a statement here on the 5th, saying that the Secretariat of the All-African People's Conference strongly protests the reactionaries' disregard for the Congo's independence and basic law, under the direction of the imperialists, in kidnapping Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba.

The statement said that the Secretariat demands the release of Lumumba and Congolese cabinet ministers and members of parliament who have been illegally arrested under similar circumstances.

The statement also said that the Secretariat calls on all African countries, trade unions, and youth organizations to protest the outrage of kidnapping Lumumba.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 5th: African nationalist leaders in Cairo issued a statement here today at a press conference on the kidnapping of Lumumba, strongly condemning the conspiracies of imperialism and the United Nations to interfere in the Congo's internal affairs. The statement also guaranteed that they would work together to free African countries from the rule of colonialism and imperialism and achieve true independence and freedom.

The African organizations holding this press conference were: the Kenya African National Union, the Uganda National Congress, the Zanzibar Nationalist Party, the Cameroon People's Union, the South African United Front, the Northern Rhodesia United National Independence Party, and the Southern Rhodesia National Democratic Party.

The statement pointed out that Lumumba is the only legitimate leader of the Congolese people, the only leader appointed by the people in a democratic Congo. The statement pointed out that the Congo's legitimate government—the legitimate government of the people—has been deprived of its representation in the United Nations, while Kasavubu, who opposed the instructions of the two houses of parliament, has been allowed by this world body to usurp the seat of the Congolese government. The statement said, "This is shocking."

The statement said, "If Lumumba is not released and is actually brought to trial before a court, we will demand that, in order to maintain the fairness of the law and the constitution, and for the sake of Pan-Africanism, African independent countries must withdraw from the United Nations."

The statement also said, "We also demand that, if this act of injustice is tolerated, all countries that care about the unity of the Congo, the solidarity of Africa, and world peace must sever diplomatic relations with any country that opposes the unity of the Congo, first and foremost with Belgium."

The statement called on African independent countries to immediately hold a summit meeting to consider the Congo issue in light of the current situation.

The statement also called on the General Affairs Committee of the All-African People's Conference and the Executive Committee of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization to hold meetings to discuss the events in the Congo in order to uphold justice and seek to restore the democratic government of the Congo.

The statement also called on all freedom-loving people in the world to oppose the influence of neo-colonialism and imperialism in the Congo and throughout Asia and Africa.

Xinhua News Agency, December 7th: Newspapers and radio stations in Africa and Asia continue to condemn the crime of imperialism and its agents in kidnapping Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba, the head of the legitimate government, and point out that the United Nations is an accomplice to this crime.

Bamako's *Development News*, the capital of the Republic of Mali, said on the 6th that it is now certain that the United Nations, by allowing the armed kidnapping of Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba, has proved itself to be an accomplice of the traitorous groups of Tshombe and Mobutu, who are tools in the hands of colonialists and imperialists.

The newspaper said, "The people of Mali fully support and sympathize with the cause of the Congolese people and believe that the Congolese central government of Prime Minister Lumumba remains the trustee of legitimate rights."

According to this newspaper, after Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba was kidnapped, President Keita of the Republic of Mali sent a telegram to Mamadou, the head of the Malian delegation to the United Nations, instructing him on the actions the Malian delegation should take at the United Nations. In this telegram, Keita condemned the colonialist conspiracy to devour the Congo. The instructions held that the illegal arrest of Lumumba by imperialism and its servants had aggravated the situation in the Congo and seriously threatened peace, and demanded the immediate release of Lumumba.

The Libyan newspaper *Tripoli News* published an editorial on the 5th stating that the United States has completely exposed its own face by protecting Mobutu in the United Nations organization.

The newspaper pointed out that the Congo issue should be resolved by the Congolese people themselves. It is an illusion if the imperialists think they can deprive the Congolese people of their freedom. The editorial said that the Congolese people's freedom can only be deprived temporarily, because they will sooner or later defeat the imperialists.

The Middle East News Agency of the United Arab Republic issued a commentary on the 6th saying, "The United Nations has become an accomplice in the crimes committed by imperialism and its agents against the Congolese people and Lumumba."

Cairo Radio also commented on the same issue, saying, "When the United Nations went to the Congo, there was a legitimate government there supported and supported by the Congolese Parliament and the entire people. But what is there in the Congo now? Now there is only persecution of nationalists and brutal atrocities against the Congolese people."

The National Convention Party of Nigeria and Cameroon also issued a statement on the 6th condemning the kidnapping of Lumumba as an outrage and demanding his immediate release. The statement pointed out that the United Nations has an inescapable responsibility for the release of Lumumba.

The Indonesian newspaper *Dongxing Bao* said in an editorial on the 7th: "The headquarters of the 'UN forces' has become a tool of the imperialists, helping them to restore imperialist rule in the Congo." The "UN forces" cannot escape blame for the reign of terror in and around Leopoldville and the chaotic state of the entire Congo.

The Burmese newspaper *Pioneer* accused U.S. imperialism of carrying out conspiracies in the Congo under the banner of the United Nations in an editorial on the 7th. The editorial said, "Imperialist countries under the banner of the United Nations have been strengthening their puppets and letting them seize power."

The Ceylon *Virakesari* Morning Post also condemned U.S. interference in the internal affairs of the Congo in its comments on the recent situation in the Congo on the 4th. The newspaper said that the United States is doing its best to undermine the legitimate government of the Congo and create chaos in the Congo.

    亚非各国舆论要求保卫刚果独立统一
    强烈抗议美帝国主义及其同谋犯绑架卢蒙巴的罪行
    据新华社开罗6日电　亚非人民团结组织书记处今天在这里发表声明，谴责帝国主义及其代理人绑架刚果合法总理卢蒙巴的罪行。
    这个组织今天还打电报给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德和美国总统艾森豪威尔，对卢蒙巴总理和他的同事所遭到的非法的残暴对待提出强烈抗议，并认为他们的安全要由美国、其它帝国主义国家和联合国直接负责。
    声明说，“刚果发生的令人遗憾的事件激起了全世界舆论、特别是亚非世界舆论的愤怒。”声明指责联合国在帝国主义进行的殖民阴谋中所起的作用，并且指出，“这些阴谋的目的在于破坏刚果的独立，瘫痪自由刚果人民唯一合法当局的卢蒙巴政府。”
    声明最后说，亚非人民团结组织书记处迫切地要求亚非各国人民和政府以及所有爱好自由的国家及其人民继续坚定地支持卢蒙巴合法政府，并立即采取实际可行的措施来实现这一目的。
    新华社阿克拉6日电　全非人民大会秘书长阿卜杜拉·迪亚洛5日在这里发表声明说，全非人民大会秘书处强烈抗议反动派在帝国主义者的指使下，悍然不顾刚果的独立和基本法，绑架刚果总理卢蒙巴。
    声明说，秘书处要求释放卢蒙巴和在同样情况下被非法逮捕的刚果内阁部长和议员。
    声明还说，秘书处要求所有非洲国家、工会和青年组织抗议绑架卢蒙巴的暴行。
    据新华社开罗5日电　在开罗的非洲民族主义领袖今天在这里举行的记者招待会上就卢蒙巴被绑架一事发表声明，强烈谴责帝国主义和联合国干涉刚果内政的阴谋。声明并且保证，要共同为非洲国家摆脱殖民主义和帝国主义的统治，取得真正的独立与自由而斗争。
    举行这次记者招待会的非洲组织是：怯尼亚非洲民族联盟，乌干达国民大会，桑给巴尔民族主义党，喀麦隆人民联盟，南非统一阵线，北罗得西亚联合民族独立党，南罗得西亚民族民主党。
    声明指出，卢蒙巴是刚果人民唯一合法的领袖，是在民主的刚果由人民委派的唯一领袖。声明指出，刚果的合法政府——人民的合法政府被剥夺了联合国的代表权，而反对议会两院指示的卡萨武布却被这个世界机构允许窃据刚果政府的席位。声明说，“这是令人震惊的事情”。
    声明说，“如果卢蒙巴没有被释放，而实际上在法庭前受到审判，我们将要求，为了维护法律的公正和宪法，并为了泛非主义，非洲独立国家必须退出联合国。”
    声明还说，“我们还要求，如果这种违反正义的行动被容许的话，关心刚果的统一、非洲的团结和全世界的和平的一切国家必须同反对刚果统一的任何国家，首先是同比利时断绝外交关系。”
    声明要求非洲独立国家立即举行一次最高级会议，按照目前的情况来考虑刚果问题。
    声明还要求全非人民大会总务委员会和亚非人民团结组织执行委员会举行会议并讨论刚果的事件以伸张正义，并设法恢复刚果的民主政府。
    声明还号召世界一切爱好自由的人民反对新殖民主义和帝国主义在刚果和亚非各地的影响。
    据新华社7日讯　非洲和亚洲各国的报纸、电台继续纷纷谴责帝国主义及其代理人绑架刚果合法政府总理卢蒙巴的罪行，并且指出，联合国是这个罪行的同谋者。
    马里共和国首都巴马科《发展报》6日说，现在可以肯定，联合国听任武装绑架刚果总理卢蒙巴，证明它是冲伯、蒙博托等叛国集团的同谋者，而这伙人是殖民主义者和帝国主义者手中的工具。
    报纸说，“马里人民完全支持和同情刚果人民的事业，并且认为卢蒙巴总理的刚果中央政府仍然是合法权利的受托者”。
    据这家报纸报道，马里共和国总统凯塔在刚果总理卢蒙巴横遭绑架之后，曾打电报给马里驻联合国代表团团长马马杜，就马里代表团在联合国应该采取的行动作了指示。凯塔在这份电报中谴责殖民主义企图鲸吞刚果的阴谋。指示认为帝国主义及其仆从非法逮捕卢蒙巴，已使刚果局势日益恶化，并严重地威胁和平，并且要求立即释放卢蒙巴。
    利比亚《的黎波里报》5日发表社论说，美国由于在联合国组织中庇护蒙博托，就彻底暴露了它自己的面目。
    这家报纸指出，刚果问题应该由刚果人民自己解决。如果帝国主义者认为他们能剥夺掉刚果人民的自由，那是幻想。社论说，刚果人民的自由被剥夺只能是暂时的，因为他们迟早会战胜帝国主义者。
    阿联中东通讯社6日发表评论说，“联合国已经成为帝国主义及其代理人对刚果人民和卢蒙巴所犯罪行的同谋者。”
    开罗电台也就同一问题发表评论说，“当联合国前往刚果的时候，那里有一个受到刚果的议会和全体人民拥护和支持的合法政府，但是，现在刚果有什么呢？现在只有对民族主义者的迫害，对刚果人民的野蛮的暴行。”
    尼日利亚和喀麦隆国民会议党6日也发表声明，谴责绑架卢蒙巴是一种暴行，并要求立即释放卢蒙巴。声明指出，联合国对释放卢蒙巴有无可逃避的责任。
    印度尼西亚《东星报》7日的社论指出：“联合国军”总司令部已经成为帝国主义者的工具，帮助他们在刚果恢复帝国主义的统治。对于在利奥波德维尔和附近地区的恐怖统治以及整个刚果局势的混乱状态，“联合国军”是逃避不了应受的谴责的。
    缅甸《先锋报》在7日的社论中指责，美帝国主义打着联合国旗号在刚果进行阴谋活动。社论说，“打着联合国旗号的帝国主义国家一直在加强他们的傀儡并让他们夺取权力。”
    锡兰《维腊克萨里》晨报4日在评论刚果最近的局势时也谴责美国干涉刚果的内政。这家报纸说，美国正在竭尽全力破坏刚果合法政府，并在刚果制造混乱。
