Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd. People in many Western European countries held rallies and demonstrations to oppose participation in the nuclear arms race or to protest the establishment of North Atlantic Treaty Organization and American nuclear weapons bases on their territories.

The Lancashire Confederation of Trades Councils, representing 750,000 trade union members in the Lancashire region, strongly condemned the Macmillan government's permission for the United States to establish a "Polaris" missile base at Holy Loch in Scotland at a quarterly meeting held in Manchester on the 26th. Representatives of sixty-one trade union councils demanded that the British Trades Union Congress express strong opposition to the American military bases in Britain and condemned the agreement between the British and American governments on the establishment of the "Polaris" missile base.

It is reported that representatives of 36,000 miners from forty-eight coal mines in Derbyshire decided at a meeting on the 26th to lodge a strong protest with Macmillan against the United States establishing a "Polaris" missile submarine base under its control in Britain. The Building Engineering Union Regional Conference, including all branches in northwest England, condemned the provision of bases for American "Polaris" missiles as "an act of betrayal of the people."

William Alexander, Assistant Secretary of the British Communist Party, called on the 26th to expand the movement against the American "Polaris" missile base to every village and town in Britain. He said that the Americans must be made to understand that their "Polaris" missile submarines are not allowed to dock anywhere in Britain.

According to newspaper reports, marches and demonstrations have been planned in Manchester, Glasgow, Edinburgh, and elsewhere. Workers in mines and factories will set up picket lines in front of the American Embassy and American consulates, send representatives to meet with members of parliament, carry placards, pass resolutions, and file protests.

One hundred and fifty students from Oxford University in Britain braved the heavy rain on the 27th to demonstrate at the American Air Force base twenty kilometers away, demanding the withdrawal of American nuclear military bases established on British territory and demanding a ban on nuclear weapons. Many people joined the demonstration along the way.

More than 1,000 people from all walks of life in Oslo, the capital of Norway, held a mass meeting on the 27th to protest the deployment of atomic weapons on Norwegian territory. The meeting was initiated by prominent Norwegian scientists, trade unions, and social figures.

The conference adopted an appeal emphasizing that the Norwegian people "will not allow the establishment of any atomic bases on Norwegian territory."

Under the slogans of "For a Netherlands Without Atomic Weapons" and "No Assistance to German Revanchists," the working people of the Netherlands held a massive demonstration in Amsterdam. The demonstrators distributed leaflets and pamphlets opposing the cooperation of some Dutch scientists with West German militarists in the manufacture of atomic weapons, opposing the transport of nuclear weapons into the Netherlands, and demanding the removal of missile bases located in the Netherlands.

Xinhua News Agency, December 1st. Tass reported from Paris: A movement against the establishment of West German military bases in France is currently unfolding in major cities and settlements in France, with the slogan: There is no place on French soil for the successors of Hitler's bandits.

In the Eure-et-Loir department, nineteen organizations of former resistance fighters and victims of Nazi persecution, the local organizations of the French Communist Party, the Radical Socialist Party, the Socialist Party, and seven trade union organizations have established a struggle committee against the establishment of a West German air force base in Fréteval.

A mass rally was held in Lyon to protest the stationing of West German troops on French territory.

The Committee for the Defense of Peace in Saint-Florentin, Yonne, called on all citizens to hold a rally on December 4th to protest the establishment of a military depot for West German troops near the city. The committee emphasized that nineteen years ago, Laval, a traitor to the French people, engaged in a "symbolic handshake" with Goering in Saint-Florentin. But history must not be allowed to repeat itself!

In the Pas-de-Calais department, which suffered greatly during World War II, many social groups have also called on residents to hold demonstrations against the entry of West German troops into France.

An international meeting of former resistance fighters was held in Strasbourg, France, where former resistance fighters from France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and anti-fascists from West Germany discussed the issue of West German rearmament. In a resolution passed at the meeting, participants said, "We oppose the rearmament of West Germany, oppose the establishment of military bases of the (West German) Federal Defense Force on the territory of our countries, and oppose those who are once again brewing the idea of a 'Greater Germany.'" The resolution went on to say: "The spirit of mutual support that united us in the fight against Hitler's oppression now unites us in the face of the growing danger of aggression from West German militarism, which threatens our countries and universal peace."
