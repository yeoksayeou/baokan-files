    This dispatch from Nanchang on the 18th: The First Production Team of the Xingfen Brigade of the Huatang Commune in Lianhua County, Jiangxi Province, when formulating its production plan for next year, fully mobilized the masses to summarize and promote the experience of implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" in accordance with local conditions over the past few years. This has provided reliable technical measures for advanced production increase targets, thereby enhancing the masses' confidence in striving for a bumper harvest next year, and actively preparing for spring production.
    The First Production Team of the Xingfen Brigade is located in a mountainous area with many terraced fields and poor soil. In 1957, the average grain yield per mu in this team was only 378 jin, but by 1960 it had increased by 24.3%. Team cadres deeply realized that one of the main reasons for the continuous increase in grain yield per unit area and the winning of the county's Red Flag Team title was the full exercise of the team's initiative in formulating technical measures in accordance with local conditions.
    In order to make next year's production increase plan more advanced and reliable, the team cadres recently fully mobilized the masses to further summarize the experience of implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" in accordance with local conditions over the past few years.
    
    Bring into Play the Drive of Young People; Draw on the Experience of Old Farmers
    
    Fully utilizing the production enthusiasm of young people, while also fully utilizing the production experience of old farmers, is one of the team’s experiences in correctly implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture." In promoting various technical measures, the cadres of this team first paid attention to giving full play to the active role of each commune member. Based on the characteristics of young people being quick to accept new things and daring to think and act, and old people being rich in practical production experience, before promoting each technical measure, they held "five-generation gatherings," where people of all ages expressed their opinions and discussed major plans together. This not only mobilized the production enthusiasm of each commune member, but also made the production increase measures both proactive and reliable. When discussing soil improvement during the spring plowing season this year, the young commune member He Liangcai's experience of increasing production by plowing and harrowing yellow sandy mud fields more frequently and appropriately deep plowing was decided to be widely promoted throughout the team. Old farmer He Shengui and others disagreed, arguing that there was a shortage of labor and it was impossible to do so; some white mud fields had fine soil particles, were sticky, and easily crusted, making them unsuitable for multiple plowing and harrowing; some deep mud fields were not only unsuitable for deep plowing, but also required methods to deepen the mud base. At the "five-generation gathering," after mutual enlightenment and unified thinking, it was decided to adopt the method of "determining plowing and harrowing based on soil layer," determining that yellow sandy mud fields should be plowed and harrowed more frequently, white mud fields should be plowed densely and harrowed finely, and deep mud fields should be plowed coarsely and harrowed shallowly. In this way, the team cadres concentrated labor to plow and harrow yellow sandy mud fields more frequently, and the soil layer of this type of field was thickened by more than half an inch, and the soil blocks were smoothed and softened, resulting in an increase in production of about 2% compared to other fields. Based on this experience, when formulating next year's production plan, the number of plowing and harrowing times and the depth of plowing were also determined according to different soil layers, which satisfied the commune members. In the current winter plowing, the old farmer He Desheng is vying to plow the white mud fields, saying: "I have figured out the temper of this type of field, and I guarantee that every field will increase production."
    
    Based on the characteristics of the strengths and weaknesses of the elderly and young people, the team cadres attached great importance to mobilizing the youth and the elderly to teach and learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses, so that each technical measure could be formulated accurately and steadily. After visiting other places and learning about the experience of planting red clover green manure, young commune member He Guikai proposed to the team cadres to promote this production increase measure. Old farmers such as He Shengui, who had grown red clover before, introduced the planting methods of red clover and worked with young people to first promote it in hillside fields where water sources were easy to find, and then tested it in flooded fields with more waterlogging. After two years of practice, 65% of the fields in this mountainous team have promoted red clover, and it is growing vigorously.
    
    Summarize Successful Experiences; Also Accept the Lessons of Failure
    
    Not neglecting the individual lessons of failure during success, and finding ways to improve from the lessons of failure, is the second experience of this team in implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" to ensure annual production increases. The cadres of this team realized in actual production that due to the different natural conditions such as soil quality, sunshine, and water source of each field, especially in mountainous areas where sunshine is weak and the soil is shallow, the differences are even greater. Therefore, an advanced technology may succeed here and fail there; succeed in the previous season and fail in the next season. When promoting various technical measures, this team attached importance to seriously accepting lessons during failures, using this to educate commune members not to be complacent in success and not to be discouraged in failure, so that the experience of promoting technical measures became richer and richer. This year, this team successfully implemented appropriate close planting on 169 mu of early rice. When summarizing this experience, production team leader He Longyuan found a "lame seedling" (one side high, one side low) in it and mobilized the masses to find lessons. The cultivation, fertilization, and transplanting density of this field were all the same, but the seedlings were good on one side and bad on the other, and the yield differed by 5%. By finding the cause, it was discovered that this terraced field was close to the mountain, with poor sunshine, slightly higher terrain, and poor ability to retain fertilizer and water, so the tillering was short and small. By dissecting this "sparrow," they found the rule that lean fields have small tillers, fertile fields have large tillers, lean fields need to be denser than fertile fields, and the mountainside needs to be denser than the outside of the mountain. Next year's early rice close planting specifications will be determined according to this rule. For example, this team once rotted some seedlings in the promotion of early spring sowing measures this year, so some commune members suggested that next year they should still follow the old almanac of "vaguely understanding, soaking seeds during Qingming." This time, through summarization, they also found experience in failure. That is: "After the vernal equinox" and "before Qingming" is a good season for sowing in this mountainous area. The commune members agreed on the spring sowing time set according to this season and proposed a suggestion of applying basal fertilizer in the autumn fields this winter. Since this team paid attention to seriously accepting lessons in failure, the enthusiasm of the commune members in promoting advanced experience has always been strong.
    
    Find Weak Links in High-Yield Fields; Find Production Increase Factors in Low-Yield Fields
    
    Finding weak links in high-yield fields, finding production increase factors in low-yield fields, adapting to local conditions, and prescribing the right medicine is the third experience of this team in implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture." This team has 20 mu of Men Zhuang fields, which are called "lean meat" by the masses. In the promotion of production increase measures, they were considered to have "reached the top of production increase." More than 30 mu of flood fields in mountain pits were considered "dead corners" and put aside. Later, after the team cadres inspired the old farmers and young people to find weak links in high-yield fields and find production increase factors in low-yield fields, it was discovered that although the yield of the Men Zhuang fields was high, the proportion of sterile grains was large, and although the yield of the flood fields was low, there were fewer sterile grains. Through comparative analysis, it was found that the reason for the high number of sterile grains in the Men Zhuang fields was that too much nitrogen fertilizer was applied, resulting in partial lodging; the reason for the low number of sterile grains in the flood fields was that some plant ash was burned nearby and applied to the fields, and the lodging-resistant "Qiubai" rice variety was used. After finding the reason, the team adopted the practice of selecting varieties based on the two conditions of the next season's crops and the fertility of the soil, and determining the type and amount of fertilizer to be applied based on soil properties, soil layer thickness, and seedling growth. Since this year, due to the comprehensive promotion of this experience, the Men Zhuang fields have eliminated the lodging of seedlings, and sterile grains have been reduced from the original 6% to 1%.
    
    Recently, He Chengqing, the secretary of the brigade branch, went deep into this team and comprehensively inspected the production increase plan and measures they had formulated. He Chengqing was very satisfied with the measures formulated by the team in mobilizing the masses and adapting to local conditions, such as plowing and harrowing, deep plowing, close planting specifications, multiple cropping index, and variety selection. He said: "Believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and there is nothing that cannot be done." After the masses formulated the production increase measures, they have already taken active action. The commune members are busy with winter plowing, various spring sowing seeds have been prepared in "double portions," and more than 100 mu of green manure fields have been covered with thatch to prevent frost and freezing.

    总结运用“八字宪法”经验  增产计划订得更先进更可靠
    星分一小队充分发挥因地制宜制定技术措施权力
    本报南昌18日电　江西莲花县花塘公社星分大队第一生产小队在制定明年生产计划时，充分发动群众总结与推广了几年来因地制宜贯彻农业“八字宪法”的经验，使先进的增产指标有了可靠的技术措施，从而增强了群众争取明年大丰收的信心，并积极做好明春生产准备工作。
    星分大队第一生产小队地处山区，梯田较多，土质贫瘠。1957年这个小队粮食亩产平均只有三百七十八斤，到1960年增长了24.3％。小队干部深刻体会到：粮食单位产量连年增长，获得全县红旗小队称号的主要原因之一，是充分发挥了小队因地制宜制定技术措施的主动性。
    为了把明年的增产计划订得更先进可靠，最近小队干部又全面地发动群众，进一步总结几年来因地制宜执行农业“八字宪法”的经验。
    发挥青年的干劲  吸取老农的经验
    充分发挥青年的生产积极性，也充分发挥老农的生产经验。把青年、老农在推广技术措施中的积极性和特长都发挥出来，是这个小队能够正确贯彻农业“八字宪法”的经验之一。这个小队的干部在推广各项技术措施中，首先注意了发挥每个社员的积极作用。他们根据青年人接受新事物快、敢想敢干和老年人富有生产实际经验的特点，在推广每项技术措施前，都召开“五代同堂会”，老老少少各抒己见，共商大计。这样既调动了每个社员生产积极性，又使增产措施既积极又可靠。今年春耕讨论改良土壤时，青年社员贺良材等在黄沙泥田多犁多耙、适当深耕的增产经验，决定在全队普遍推广。老农贺生桂等不同意，理由是：劳动力少，办不到；有些白泥田土粒细，带粘性，易结板，不宜多犁多耙；有些深泥田不但不宜深耕，还要设法增深泥脚。在“五代同堂会”上，经过互相启发，统一思想，就决定了“看土层定犁耙”的作法，确定黄沙泥田多犁多耙、白泥田密犁细耙、深泥田粗犁浅耙的耕作方法。这样，小队干部便集中劳力多犁多耙黄沙泥田，并使这类田的土层增厚了半寸多，土块整得细软，比别的田增产2％左右。根据这条经验，在制定明年生产计划时，也按照不同土层确定了犁耙次数和深耕程度，社员都很满意。在目前冬耕中，老农贺德生争着去犁白泥田，他说：这号田的脾气我摸透了，保证整得它丘丘增产。
    根据老年、青年各有长短的特点，小队干部十分重视发动青年、老年互教互学，取长补短，使每项技术措施订得准、订得稳。青年社员贺桂开在外地参观了种红花草绿肥的经验后，向小队干部提议要推广这项增产措施。曾经种过红花草的老农贺生桂等便介绍了红花草的种植方法，并和青年人一道，先在易找水源的山坡田里推广，又在渍水较多的冲田里试验。经过两年实践，这个山区的小队已有65％的田推广了红花草，而且生长旺盛。
    总结成功的经验  也接受失败的教训
    在成功的时候不忽视个别失败的教训，在失败的教训中找改进的办法，是这个小队贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”保证年年增产的经验之二。这个小队干部在实际生产中体会到：由于每丘、每垅田的土质、阳光、水源等自然条件不同，特别是山区的阳光照射弱、土质浅薄，差异更大。因此，一项先进的技术就会在这里成功，在那里失败；上一季成功，下一季失败。这个小队在推广各项技术措施时，都重视在失败时认真接受教训，以此教育社员成功不自满，失败不气馁，使推广技术措施的经验越来越丰富。今年这个小队一百六十九亩早稻实施适当密植获得成功。在总结这一经验时，生产小队长贺龙元却在其中找了一丘“跛足禾”（一边高，一边低），并发动群众找教训。这丘田耕作、施肥、插秧密度都一样，但禾苗却一边好，一边坏，产量相差5％。通过找原因，发现了是由于这丘梯田靠山，阳光较差，地势稍高，保肥保水能力差，因此发稞短小。通过解剖这个“麻雀”，便找到了瘦田禾苗发蔸小、肥田禾苗发蔸大，瘦田比肥田要密，山边比山外要密的规律。明年早稻的密植规格就按照这一规律定了下来。又如，这个小队今年在推广提早春播的措施中，曾经烂了一些秧，因此就有一些社员建议明年仍按“蒙蒙懂懂，清明浸种”的老皇历办事。这次通过总结，又在失败中找到了经验。这就是：“春分”后“清明”前，是这个山区地带播种的好季节。按照这个季节定下的明年春播时间，社员都同意，并且提出了今冬在秋田里下基肥的建议。这个小队由于注意了在失败时认真接受教训，社员推广先进经验的劲头始终旺盛。
    在高产田找薄弱环节在低产田找增产因素
    在高产田里找薄弱环节，在低产田里找增产因素，因地制宜，对症下药，是这个小队贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”的经验之三。这个小队有二十亩被群众称为“精肉”的门庄田，在推广增产措施中，被认为“增产已经到顶”，另有三十多亩山坑的洪水田则被认为是“死角”而被放在一边。后经小队干部启发老农、青年在高产田里找薄弱环节，在低产田里找增产因素，发现了门庄田产量虽高，秕谷的比重却大，洪水田产量虽低，秕谷却少。通过对比分析，找到了门庄田秕谷多的原因是：氮肥下得过多而出现局部倒伏；洪水田秕谷少是因为就近烧了一些草木灰下田，又是用的不易倒伏的“秋白”稻种。找到原因之后，这个队便采取了就下季作物和土质肥瘠两种情况，选用品种，并根据土质属性、土层厚薄、禾苗长势，确定施肥种类和施肥多少。今年以来，由于全面地推广了这条经验，门庄田消灭了禾苗的倒伏现象，秕谷由原来的6％降到1％。
    最近，这个大队的支部书记贺澄清深入这个小队，全面地检查了他们所订的增产计划和措施。贺澄清对这个小队发动群众、因地制宜所订出的犁耙深耕、密植规格、复种指数、品种选用等措施都很满意。他说：“相信群众，依靠群众，没有办不好的事。”群众在订出了增产措施以后，已经积极行动起来。社员们正在忙着冬耕，各种春播种籽已准备了“双份”，一百多亩绿肥田已盖上了防霜防冻的茅草。
