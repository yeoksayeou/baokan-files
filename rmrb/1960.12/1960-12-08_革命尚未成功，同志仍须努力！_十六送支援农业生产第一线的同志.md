"The revolution has not yet succeeded, comrades must still work hard!"
    ——Seeing off sixteen comrades to support the front line of agricultural production
    Gesong
    Comrades supporting the front line of agricultural production, some have already rushed to the rural people's communes, and some are preparing to set off. We have written more than a dozen articles about "sending off," and we have said a lot. However, even with thousands of words, I still feel that there is more to say, so I will say a few more words in the end.
    As people who cannot go to the front line for the time being, we are extremely envious of the comrades who are going to the countryside. With thousands of troops and horses going to the front line, it is foreseeable that a shocking production upsurge will be set off on the vast land, and tremendous changes will take place. This new storm is the new high tide of vigorously developing grain production, and it is a new great revolution to greatly advance rural work. This revolution is to eliminate poverty and backwardness.
    The revolution, starting from the distant past, has been going on for more than a hundred years; from the recent past, it has also been forty years. Countless revolutionary predecessors shed blood and sacrificed, followed one after another, unyielding, and finally bloomed brilliant flowers in 1949. The Party and Chairman Mao led us, took over the revolutionary torch from our predecessors, and without dismounting, pushed the revolution from one stage to a new stage. The revolutionary cause is endless, and therefore the struggle is also endless. The greatest aspiration of a revolutionary is here, and the greatest happiness is also here. If anyone has ever imagined that the revolution would end one morning, and from then on they could safely and comfortably prop up their pillows and sleep soundly, then they are just a greedy loafer or a cowardly coward, and definitely not a true proletarian fighter.
    Isn't it? Our revolution against nature has just begun, and God always has to mess with us every year. Our socialist revolution has not yet ended, and there is still a long way to go to communism. And the development of things is always uneven. While our basic task is socialist revolution and socialist construction, communist factors have already begun to sprout. With the passage of time, these factors will continue to grow and develop, becoming a towering tree. This is one aspect. On the other hand, the democratic revolution in individual production teams is not so thorough. There, the remnants of feudal forces are still causing trouble. Have you all read the article "Old He Arrived at 'Little Geng's Home'" (People's Daily, November 22, page 8)? That article shows that in a few production teams of the commune, individual illegal landlords and rich peasant elements are still looking for opportunities to make trouble and sabotage the people's commune. The flames of class struggle have not been extinguished. The struggle between socialism and capitalism exists, and the struggle against the remnants of feudal forces also exists. This is not surprising. Chairman Mao has long instructed us: "The road is tortuous. There are still many obstacles and many difficulties on the road of revolution." He also said: "There is no straight road in the world. Be prepared to take a tortuous road and don't be greedy for petty advantages." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume IV, page 1162) Comrades who go to the front line of agricultural production must face this situation squarely, recognize that rural work is still extremely difficult, how much work is waiting for you there, and how many revolutionary tasks are calling you! Where the revolutionary task has not been completely completed, we need to "carry the revolution through to the end." In this respect, we still need Sun Yat-sen's two testamentary words: "The revolution has not yet succeeded, comrades must still work hard!"
    Looking forward to the future, the prospects are infinitely bright, but there are also many difficulties. However, compared with the revolutionary predecessors who blazed trails through thorns and briars, compared with the revolutionary martyrs who held high the torch and opened the gate of hell in the long night, what can these difficulties be considered? Are they not precisely the driving force to encourage us to work hard and forge ahead courageously? "The road ahead is long and winding, I will search up and down." This is a sentence from Qu Yuan's "Li Sao." We might as well borrow these two lines of poetry for a new interpretation. The road of revolution is long; revolutionaries need to constantly work hard, constantly struggle, fight against the sky, fight against the earth, and fight against people. What to seek? To seek the complete success of the revolution, to seek the victory of Marxism throughout the world!
    Reluctantly parting, words are short but feelings are long. I hope that the comrades who are supporting the front line of agricultural production will show strong will and a spirit of not fearing hardship, be determined to carry the revolution through to the end, so that evil spirits will decline and righteousness will rise, and we will definitely strive for a great agricultural harvest in 1961.

### “革命尚未成功，同志仍须努力！”——十六送支援农业生产第一线的同志

    “革命尚未成功，同志仍须努力！”
    ——十六送支援农业生产第一线的同志
    戈松
    支援农业生产第一线的同志们，有的已经奔向农村人民公社，有的正在整装待发。我们
  “送”的文章也已写了十多篇，要说的话也说得不少了。然而，纵使万语千言，总觉得意有未尽，最后还要再说几句。
    作为暂时还不能上第一线去的人，对下乡的同志们，实在是不胜羡慕之至的。千军万马上第一线，可以预见在辽阔的土地上，将要掀起一场多么惊人的生产高潮，将要发生多么巨大的变化，这场新的暴风骤雨，就是大办粮食的生产新高潮，就是把农村工作大大向前推进一步的新的大革命。这个革命，要革掉一穷二白的命。
    革命，从远的算起，已经革了一百多年；从近的算，也已经四十年了。无数革命前辈流血牺牲，前仆后继，不折不挠，终于在1949年开出了灿烂的鲜花。党和毛主席领导我们，接过了前辈们的革命火炬，快马加鞭未下鞍，把革命从一个阶段推上一个新的阶段。革命事业是无穷无尽的，因而斗争也是无穷无尽的。革命者最大的志愿在这里，最大的幸福也在这里。如果谁曾设想过革命会在一个早上宣告结束，从此就可以安安稳稳地垫起枕头睡大觉，那么他只是一个贪便宜的懒汉或是胆小怕事的懦夫，决不是真正的无产阶级战士。
    不是么？我们对大自然的革命刚刚开始，老天爷每年总还要跟我们捣乱。我们的社会主义革命还没有结束，离开共产主义还有一段路程。而事物的发展又总是不平衡的。在我们的基本任务是社会主义革命、社会主义建设的同时，共产主义的因素已经开始萌芽，随着时间的推移，这因素将会不断茁壮、发展，蔚然成材，这是一方面。另一方面，个别生产队里的民主革命还不那么彻底，那里，封建残余势力还在作怪。大家不是读过《老贺到了“小耿家”》
  （11月22日人民日报八版）那篇文章吗？那篇文章说明：在公社的少数生产队里，个别不法的地主、富农分子还在寻找机会捣乱，破坏人民公社，阶级斗争的火焰并没有熄灭，社会主义同资本主义的斗争存在，同封建残余势力的斗争，同样存在。这并不是奇怪事情。毛主席早就指示我们：“道路是曲折的。在革命的道路上还有许多障碍物，还有许多困难。”他又说：“世界上没有直路，要准备走曲折的路，不要贪便宜。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷1162页）到农业生产第一线去的同志，必须正视这一情况，认清农村工作还极为艰苦，那儿有多少工作在等着你们，有多少革命任务在召唤着你们！革命任务尚未彻底完成的地方，需要我们“将革命进行到底”。从这方面来说，我们还用得着孙中山先生的两句遗嘱：“革命尚未成功，同志仍须努力！”
    展望前途，光明无限，而困难也不少。然而，比起披荆斩棘的革命先辈来，比起在漫漫长夜里高举火炬打开地狱之门的先烈，这些困难又能算得什么呢？它们岂不正是鼓舞我们发愤图强、奋勇前进的动力吗？“路漫漫其修远兮，吾将上下而求索。”这是屈原《离骚》里的句子。我们也不妨借用这两句诗来作新的解释。革命的路正长；革命者就需要不断地努力，不断地斗争，与天斗争，与地斗争，与人斗争。求索什么？求索革命的彻底成功，求索马克思主义在全世界的胜利！
    临别依依，语短心长，希望支援农业生产第一线的同志们，拿出坚强的意志和不怕艰苦的精神，立志革命到底，使邪气下降，正气上升，一定争取1961年的农业大丰收。
