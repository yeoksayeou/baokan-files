Implement the Idea of Agriculture as the Foundation in Production
	Shanghai Steel Rolling Mills Prioritize Production of Steel for Agricultural Use
	Kunming Rolling Mill Strives to Expand Steel Varieties to Support Agriculture
	(Our newspaper, Shanghai, 28th dispatch) Shanghai's steel rolling mills are prioritizing the arrangement of agricultural steel production in order to support agricultural technical transformation in various regions with more high-quality steel.
	Since the beginning of this year, Shanghai's production of agricultural steel has increased significantly compared to last year. Tractor repair factories in Heilongjiang and light railways on farms on Hainan Island have also used Shanghai-rolled steel. In the first eleven months of this year, Shanghai's machinery industry system produced over ten million tractor and internal combustion engine parts, and over nine thousand agricultural water pumps for various regions. About 70% of the steel used for these products, as well as the fertilizer equipment currently being produced for various regions, was rolled and supplied locally by Shanghai's steel rolling mills. In recent months, various regions have begun preparing production materials for next year's spring plowing, and Shanghai has provided more steel of a wider variety. From September to November, the supply of steel used for the production of modern agricultural tools by factories such as the Luoyang First Tractor Factory, the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, and the Tianjin Tractor Factory was greater than the supply in the first eight months of this year. The steel supplied to the suburban counties of Shanghai for the production and maintenance of agricultural tools in the fourth quarter also increased significantly compared to the same period last year. In addition, a large number of high-quality strip steel and ball bearing steel were produced to support the rural areas of Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Zhejiang, Guangdong and other provinces in the manufacture of vehicles.
	Shanghai's steel rolling mills strive to deliver the urgently needed agricultural steel whenever it is needed and provide whatever is needed to the best of their ability. The strip steel used by Anhui to manufacture pedicabs was originally scheduled to be delivered by the end of the year, but thanks to the labor competition launched by the steel rolling workers to deliver the goods ahead of schedule, the delivery was completed in October. Before the busy autumn harvest season, agricultural machinery factories in various regions requested Shanghai to supply a batch of ear-shaped steel for the manufacture of threshers. Although the quantity of this steel was small, the specifications were very complex. The employees responsible for this task happily accepted the task and also launched a labor competition to compete for speed and quality, meeting the needs of various regions in a timely manner.
	"Every inch of steel represents a piece of our hearts, high-quality steel is sent to the countryside, agriculture is clearly the foundation, and workers and peasants are fighting with one heart." Shanghai's steel rolling workers, with deep feelings for their peasant brothers, supply the best steel to various regions. The Shanghai Cold-Rolled Strip Steel Plant found that the pickling process could not keep up with the steel rolling of agricultural machinery steel in October, which would affect the quality of the steel. In order to solve this problem, the entire factory worked together to attack the pickling process, and within five days, the pickling process was basically mechanized. As a result, the pass rate and first-class rate of this batch of agricultural steel reached 99.97% and 99.82% respectively. The quality requirements for steel pipes used in fertilizer production are extremely high. The workers at the Shanghai Steel Pipe Plant were very careful during production, striving to make the pipes smooth both inside and out and able to withstand a certain amount of pressure. Zhang Yuetian, the head of the hot rolling team, once discovered that some of the steel pipes produced by the previous shift had a texture on the surface. He squatted next to the rolling mill and carefully checked it, discovering a grain of rice-sized iron filings in the rolling groove of the rolling mill. After removing it, he prevented the problem of the texture. Under his leadership, the quality of the steel pipes used for fertilizer equipment rolled by this hot rolling team was very high.
	(Our newspaper dispatch) According to a Yunnan Daily report: Leading cadres of the Kunming Rolling Mill continuously conduct ideological education with agriculture as the foundation for their employees, which has stimulated the consciousness of steel rolling workers to support agriculture, breaking through various key production technologies. They have achieved over-fulfillment of the task of rolling various types of steel for agriculture according to the plan, while promoting the entire steel rolling production to achieve high quality, high yield, and multiple varieties.
	In November, all employees of the factory worked hard to change the phenomenon of only rolling one or two kinds of steel per month in the past. In one month, they rolled eight kinds of steel for agriculture, including knife steel, hoe steel, air cylinder strip steel, hoe blade flat steel, foreign hoe small thin plate, plow beam steel, small flat steel, and machete steel. Many varieties of small agricultural tool steel were also made into rough agricultural tool shapes, reducing the workload for agricultural tool factories. In terms of steel output, the factory completed the monthly plan five days ahead of schedule in November, exceeding it by 10.3%, an increase of 65.4% compared to the same period last month. The pass rate of steel reached 98.7%, and coal consumption was reduced by 18.2%. The high monthly output and variety of steel have created new records since the establishment of the factory.
	Since October, the task of supporting agricultural steel production undertaken by this factory has gradually increased; in November, it was converted to rolling all steel for agriculture. The variety and quality requirements of steel are also higher than in the past. The factory's Party general branch promptly reported to the employees on the current excellent situation and the important significance of vigorously supporting agriculture, and clearly proposed that rolling steel for rural areas is the current urgent task. All workshops have strengthened ideological and political work in light of their own actual situations, and implemented the principle of taking agriculture as the foundation. When the steel rolling workshop was rolling knife steel, the Party branch found that some people disliked the hardness of the steel, the small power of the rolling mill, and feared that it would affect output. They organized everyone to discuss: "Can the countryside do without sickles and hoes? Can we have sickles and hoes without knife steel?" Through discussion, cadres and the masses realized that this was urgently needed steel for making small agricultural tools, and they actively tried to increase the steel temperature and improve the quality of the plum blossom sleeve, which increased the output of knife steel. After learning that some employees thought that "it doesn't matter if the quality of the steel is a little poor, anyway, the countryside has to process it" and "it's okay if it's thicker, just hit it a few more hammers in the countryside," the Party branch organized employees to recall how difficult it was to use clumsy hoes in the countryside. Many people said: "I had opinions when I used clumsy hoes when I was working in the countryside." Some said: "We can adjust the machine if the steel is thin or thick, but we don't know how many hammers we have to swing in the countryside." After discussion, employees generally improved their sense of responsibility. They not only considered completing the production plan, but also paid attention to facilitating rural use, and consciously paid attention to specifications and quality.
	The Party general branch also mobilized the masses to carry out technical innovation to overcome weaknesses in production technology. The steel rolling workshop summarized the operating experience of the old worker Zhang Rong in burning the heating furnace through a "three-way combination" furnace-side consultation experiment, and adopted a combination of local and foreign methods based on the suggestions of some old workers, realizing six improvements and innovations. This raised the steel temperature from 800 to 900 degrees in the past to 1100 to 1200 degrees, which not only reduced the consumption of spare parts, but also increased the number of steel strips from one to more than two, and the time required to walk one steel strip was accelerated by about one time. In response to the weakness that many workers were not skilled in changing roll operating techniques and took a long time, the workshop Party branch organized a roll changing operating technique performance competition for three shifts of workers to exchange experiences with each other, reducing the roll changing time from more than eight hours in the past to about four hours.

    把农业为基础的思想贯彻到生产中去
    上海各轧钢厂优先生产农业用钢材
    昆明碾片厂努力扩大钢材品种支援农业
    本报上海28日电　上海市各轧钢厂优先安排农业用钢材的生产，以更多的优质钢材支援各地进行农业技术改造。
    今年以来，上海市生产的农业用钢材比去年增加很多。黑龙江地区的拖拉机修配厂和海南岛的农场轻便铁道，也都用上了上海轧制的钢材。上海市机械工业系统今年十一个月来为各地生产的一千多万件拖拉机、内燃机配件，九千多台农业用水泵，以及正在为各地生产的化肥设备，所用的钢材有70％左右是由上海各轧钢厂就地轧制供应的。最近几个月，各地已开始为明年春耕准备生产资料，上海就为各地提供了数量更多、品种更多的钢材。从9月到11月，供应给洛阳第一拖拉机厂、北京农业机械厂、天津拖拉机厂等生产现代化农具用的钢材，就比今年前八个月中的供应量还要多；第四季度供给上海郊区各县生产农具以及维修用的钢材，也比去年同期增加很多。此外，为支援安徽、江西、河南、浙江、广东等省农村制造车子，还生产了大批优质的带钢、滚珠轴承钢材等。
    上海各轧钢厂对于农业急需的钢材，什么时候要就尽最大努力做到什么时候交；要什么，就尽一切可能给什么。安徽制造力车用的带钢，本来规定在年底全部交清，由于轧钢工人开展了提前交货的劳动竞赛，结果在10月份就交了货。三秋前，各地农业机械厂纷纷要求上海供应一批制造脱粒机用的耳型钢材。这批钢材数量虽少，规格却很复杂。担负这一任务的职工愉快地接受了任务，而且还开展了比速度快、比质量好的劳动竞赛，及时满足了各地的需要。
    “一寸钢材一片心，优质钢材送农村，明确农业为基础，工农奋战一条心。”上海轧钢工人怀着对农民兄弟的深情厚谊，以第一流的钢材供给各地。上海冷轧带钢厂，10月份轧制制造农业机械用的钢材，酸洗工序跟不上，将要影响钢材质量。全厂职工为了解决这个问题，上下一心，猛攻酸洗关，五天内就使酸洗工序基本上实现了机械化。结果，这批农业用钢材的合格率和一级品率，分别达到了99.97％和99.82％。制造化肥用的钢管，质量要求极高，上海钢管厂工人在生产时非常小心，努力做到内外都很光滑，而且经受得起一定压力。热轧组长张越田有一次发现上一班生产的钢管中有的表面上有一条纹路，就蹲在轧钢机旁边细细检查，发现轧辊的轧槽里有一粒一颗米大小的铁屑，取出以后就防止了起纹路的毛病。这个热轧小组在他的带动下，轧出的化肥设备用钢管质量都很高。
    本报讯　据云南日报消息：昆明碾片厂领导干部不断对职工进行以农业为基础的思想教育，激发了轧钢职工支援农业的自觉性，突破了各项生产技术关键，做到按计划超额完成为农业轧制多种钢材的任务，同时推动整个轧钢生产实现了优质高产多品种。
    11月份，全厂职工发愤图强，改变了过去每月只轧一、两种钢材的现象，一个月为农业轧制了刀刃钢、锄板钢、气筒带钢、锄脑扁钢、洋锄小薄板、犁辕钢、小扁钢和砍刀钢等八种钢材。不少品种的小农具钢材还做到粗具农具雏型，为农具厂减少了工作量。在钢材产量方面，11月份提前五天超额10.3％完成全月计划，比上月同期增长65.4％；钢材的合格率达到98.7％；煤耗降低了18.2％。钢材月产量之高和品种之多，都创造了建厂以来的新纪录。
    10月份以来，这个厂担负的支援农业的钢材生产任务逐步增加；11月份，转为全部为农业轧制钢材。钢材的品种和质量要求也比过去高。工厂党总支及时向职工作了当前大好形势和大力支援农业的重要意义的报告，明确提出为农村轧制钢材是当前的迫切任务。各个车间都结合自己的实际情况，加强思想政治工作，贯彻以农业为基础的方针。轧钢车间轧刀刃钢时，党支部发现有人嫌钢硬，轧机力量小，怕影响产量，就组织大家讨论：“农村没有镰刀、锄头，行不行；要镰刀锄头，没有刀刃钢行不行？”通过讨论，干部和群众都认识到这是造小农具急需的钢材，便积极设法提高钢温，改进梅花套筒的质量，提高了刀刃钢的产量。党支部了解到有的职工认为“钢材质量差一点没关系，反正农村还要加工”、“厚了到农村再打几锤就行了”等思想情况后，又组织职工回忆在农村时笨锄头如何不好用，许多人说：“我在农村劳动时用着笨锄头就有意见。”有的说：“钢材薄、厚我们只要调整一下机器就行了，到农村就不知要抡多少大锤。”经过讨论，职工普遍提高了责任心，他们不只考虑完成生产计划，还注意方便农村使用，自觉地重视规格质量。
    党总支还发动群众开展技术革新，克服生产技术上的薄弱环节。轧钢车间通过“三结合”炉边会诊试验，总结了老工人张荣烧加热炉的操作经验，并根据一些老工人的建议，采用土洋结合的办法，实现了六项改进和革新，使钢温由原来八百至九百度，提高到一千一百至一千二百度，既减少了备品配件的耗损，又使走钢条数由一条增加到两条以上，而且走一条钢所需时间加快了一倍左右。针对不少工人换辊操作技术不熟练，占用时间长的薄弱环节，车间党支部组织三班工人搞换辊操作技术表演赛，互相交流经验，使换辊时间由过去八小时以上，缩短到四小时左右。（附图片）
