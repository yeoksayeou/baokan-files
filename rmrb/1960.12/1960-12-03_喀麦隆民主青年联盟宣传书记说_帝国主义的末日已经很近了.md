Xinhua News Agency, Cairo. On the eve of "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day," the Propaganda Secretary of the Cameroon Democratic Youth League, Aroy Mali, told Xinhua reporters, "Due to the unwavering struggle of the oppressed nations of Asia and Africa against the colonial system, the colonial system is disintegrating day by day, the foundation of imperialism is being severely impacted, and its doomsday is very near."

He said, "The people of African countries who are fighting will no longer tolerate the imperialists treating them as slaves, no longer tolerate the imperialists killing them, plundering their wealth, and linking their fate with criminal war policies."

He emphasized that the oppressed nations' confidence in final victory cannot be crushed, because they know that freedom is not the exclusive right of one nation or one race.

He also said, "Whenever the people of colonial countries rise up to break free from the shackles of imperialism, the colonial countries always take up arms to launch wars in the colonial countries."

    喀麦隆民主青年联盟宣传书记说
    帝国主义的末日已经很近了
    据新华社开罗讯　在“帝国主义滚出非洲日”的前夕，喀麦隆民主青年联盟宣传书记阿罗伊·马利对新华社记者发表谈话说，“由于亚非被压迫民族对殖民主义制度进行了坚持不渝的斗争，殖民主义制度正在一天天地瓦解，帝国主义的基础正在受到严重的冲击，它的末日已经很近了。”
    他说，“进行斗争的非洲各国人民将不再能容忍帝国主义者把他们作为奴隶，不再能容忍帝国主义者杀害他们，抢劫他们的财富，并把他们的命运同罪恶的战争政策联系在一起。”
    他着重指出，被压迫民族对最后胜利的信心是粉碎不了的，因为他们知道，自由并不是一个民族或一个种族专有的权利。
    他还说，“每当殖民地国家的人民起来摆脱帝国主义的束缚的时候，殖民国家总是拿起武器在殖民地国家发动战争。”
