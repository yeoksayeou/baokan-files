Our newspaper's Xi'an dispatch on the 17th: The Shangzhai Production Team (basic accounting unit) of Yujin People's Commune, Lintong County, Shaanxi Province, has effectively mobilized the enthusiasm of its team cadres and members, ensuring meticulous and timely winter wheat management.

The Shangzhai Production Team Branch of the Chinese Communist Party recently organized all Party member cadres from the production team and smaller teams to thoroughly study various policies related to the People's Commune. Based on this study, they conducted a mass inspection and summary of autumn harvest and planting work. This summary enhanced the confidence of cadres and members in striving for a bumper wheat harvest and launched a campaign to improve winter wheat management.

A key experience summarized by the Shangzhai Production Team is to freely allow smaller teams to determine technical measures and arrange farm work according to local conditions. After the production team, in collaboration with the smaller teams, formulated production plans, it discussed the technical measures of the production team with each smaller team. After having the overall plan and requirements of the team, team cadres further went into smaller teams to help the smaller team cadres mobilize the masses to come up with ideas and methods, strictly according to the specific conditions of each smaller team, flexibly formulated practical technical measures. Production team cadres also regularly supervised and inspected according to the plans of each smaller team. This effectively brought into play the initiative and creativity of the smaller teams, strengthened the smaller teams' sense of responsibility for achieving their production plans, rationally mobilized manpower and materials, improved the quality of work, and accelerated the progress of production. Zhang Shixian, the captain of the Beishangzhai smaller team, based on the technical plan of the production team, collaborated with the workgroup leaders and experienced farmers to inspect the wheat fields plot by plot, specifically studied the planting characteristics of each piece of land, and, based on his own labor, livestock, fertilizer, and water source conditions, arranged winter management measures and daily progress plans plot by plot. For example, considering the insufficient water source, they decided to first water the fields with insufficient base moisture, watering them twice, and also bringing spring irrigation forward. This rational allocation ensured sufficient water. They promoted harrowing the wheat according to the production team's requirements, harrowing more than 200 mu of strong wheat seedlings once; but on the other hand, they also decided not to harrow the weak seedlings according to the specific conditions of the wheat fields in their smaller team, to avoid the seedlings being pressed by the soil and turning yellow. In terms of fertilization, they also treated different fertilizer qualities and quantities differently, applying more fertilizer and better fertilizer to third-class wheat fields, especially concentrating human waste and strong soil on the 64 mu of wheat fields with insufficient base fertilizer to increase soil temperature and increase effective tillering. They also selected fertilizers according to the characteristics of different varieties, using cool fertilizers on varieties with strong spring traits to prevent excessive winter growth; applying human urine to "Bima No. 1" wheat, which is weak in rust resistance, which can prevent rust disease. Because the use of water and fertilizer was appropriate, the maximum effectiveness of water and fertilizer was brought into play, and all the third-class seedling plots were upgraded.

Regarding the promotion of new technologies, the Shangzhai Production Team even more insisted on implementing the principle of "everything through experimentation" and convincing people through specific practical demonstrations. Zhou Jiguang, secretary of the Shangzhai Production Team Branch of the Chinese Communist Party and a model wheat producer in Shaanxi Province, successfully experimented with using transplanting methods to fill in broken rows and missing seedlings. The benefit of this method is that it can make the maturity period of wheat in a field consistent, and digging from dense areas to fill in sparse areas also saves seeds. When the production team promoted this new technology, they invited the heads of the wheat field management professional groups and experienced farmers from each smaller team to observe it on the spot, and the problems they raised were answered at the time if they could be solved. This allowed the experience to be quickly promoted in each smaller team. In order to better promote advanced experience, the Shangzhai Production Team also identified one smaller team as a base point for experimenting with and promoting various technical measures of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture."

Therefore, this year's winter wheat management work in the Shangzhai team has seen a new situation: smaller teams such as Beishangzhai and Nanshangzhai, Bei Juhe and Nan Juhe, have launched competitions; irrigation team members are bringing water to the fields; carts carrying fertilizer are transporting manure to the edge of the fields one after another, and then the wheat field professional groups are spreading the manure evenly. With the universal support of household fertilizer from the members, it has been guaranteed that each mu of land is fertilized with four to six carts (1,600 jin per cart), greatly exceeding last year. The entire management work has truly achieved high efficiency and meticulous work. Now, their entire team of more than 5,900 mu of wheat fields has irrigated nearly 2,000 mu and fertilized more than 1,000 mu, of which 600 mu have been irrigated with urine. It is expected that all winter irrigation can be completed and a top dressing applied once before the "Winter Solstice." (Attached picture)

### 帮助小队因地制宜确定技术措施安排农活  尚寨生产队冬麦灌水追肥细致及时

    帮助小队因地制宜确定技术措施安排农活
    尚寨生产队冬麦灌水追肥细致及时
    本报西安17日电　陕西省临潼县雨金人民公社尚寨生产队（基本核算单位），很好调动了小队干部和广大社员的积极性，把小麦越冬管理工作做得又细致又及时。
    中共尚寨生产队支部最近组织生产队和小队的全体党员干部深入学习了有关人民公社的各项政策，在这个基础上对秋收秋播工作进行了群众性的检查总结。经过总结，提高了广大干部和社员力争小麦丰收的信心，开展了搞好小麦越冬管理运动。
    尚寨生产队总结出的一条重要经验，就是放手让小队因地制宜确定技术措施和安排活路。这个生产队在协同小队制定了包产计划之后，就同各小队研究生产队的技术措施。在有了队的总规划和要求之后，队干部又进一步深入小队帮助小队干部发动群众出主意想办法，严格按照各个小队的具体情况，灵活地制定切实可行的技术措施。生产队干部并根据各小队的计划经常督促检查。这样就很好地发挥了小队的主动性和创造性，加强小队实现包产计划的责任心，合理调动人力和物力，提高作务质量，加快了生产进度。北尚寨小队队长张世贤根据生产队的技术规划，协同作业组长和老农逐片检查了麦田，具体研究了每块地的播种特点，并根据自己的劳力、畜力、肥料和水源的情况，逐片安排了冬季管理措施和日进度计划。如他们考虑到水源不足，就决定底墒不足的先浇，浇两次，同时把春灌提前。这样合理分配，水就够用了。他们根据生产队要求推行了耱麦，把二百多亩苗壮的小麦耱一遍；但另一方面又根据本小队麦田具体情况决定苗弱的不耱，避免苗子被土压住发黄。在施肥上也根据肥质肥量分别对待，三类麦田多施肥、施好肥，特别把人粪和壮土集中施到底肥不足的六十四亩麦田上，以提高地温，增加有效分蘖。他们还根据不同品种的特性选用肥料，把凉性肥料用在春性强的品种上，防止冬旺；把人尿用在抗锈力弱的“碧玛一号”麦上，可以起防治锈病的作用。因为用水施肥适当，发挥了水、肥的最大效用，三类苗块块升了级。
    对新技术的推行，尚寨生产队更坚持贯彻了“一切经过试验”和通过具体实践示范说服的方针。中共尚寨生产队党支部书记、陕西省小麦丰产模范周济广试验成功了用移苗方法来补断行缺垅。这个方法的好处可以使一块地里的小麦成熟期一致，而且挖稠补稀也节省种子。生产队在推广这个新技术时，请各个小队的麦田管理专业组负责人和老农实地观察，他们提出的问题，能解决的当时就加以解答。这就使经验很快在各个小队推广开了。尚寨生产队为了更好地推广先进经验，还确定了一个小队作为试验推广农业“八字宪法”的各项技术措施的基点。
    因此，今年尚寨队的麦田越冬管理工作出现了一个新的局面：北尚寨和南尚寨，北聚合和南聚合等小队展开了竞赛；浇地队员们正把水引到地里；运肥的架子车一辆接着一辆把粪肥运到地边，接着麦田专业组就把粪肥均匀地铺撒开了。在社员普遍用家肥支援下，已保证每亩施肥四车到六车（每车一千六百斤），大大超过去年。整个管理工作真正作到了效率高，作务细，现在他们全队五千九百多亩麦田，已经灌过近两千亩，施肥一千多亩，其中浇过尿的达六百亩，预计到“冬至”前可以全部冬灌一遍并普施一次追肥。（附图片）
