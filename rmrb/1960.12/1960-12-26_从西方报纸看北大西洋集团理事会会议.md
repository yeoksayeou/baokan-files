Viewing the North Atlantic Council Meeting from Western Newspapers

How Many of Fifteen Fingers to Pull the Trigger?

    Excerpt from the December 18th American "New York Times"
    Bringing nuclear capability to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization raised the awkward and intricate problem of controlling these weapons. The question of how an alliance of fifteen member states could control the use of nuclear weapons was simply and clearly explained by British Prime Minister Macmillan: fifteen fingers on the trigger, and fifteen fingers on the safety catch. The general opinion is that all members of the alliance cannot be allowed to exercise control in an emergency, mainly because the process of obtaining their opinions would take too long.
    Therefore, the idea was conceived of four or five countries—the United States, Britain, France, West Germany, and a small country—exercising control. However, the smaller countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization believe that this approach gives too much power to the five countries. The left wings in most North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries have suspicions and fears about allowing West Germany to share control of nuclear weapons. Finally, before a control committee can be organized, congressional approval must be obtained in the United States.
    At one point, the process of power and influence shifting within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has already begun. West Germany, having provided seven divisions of troops, has demanded and will receive greater power within this alliance. At the same time, the United States, which has paid most of the expenses over the past eleven years, is rightly demanding that other member states, especially West Germany, increase their financial contributions.
    Europeans who criticize this point believe that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will transform into an alliance controlled by West Germany in the next five years. Some people are afraid of this situation.

American Nuclear Submarine "Contribution" Does Not Justify the Cost

    Excerpt from the December 19th British "Daily Mail"
    Britain deliberately snubbed the American proposal to establish a North Atlantic Treaty Organization nuclear deterrent force with one hundred sea-based Polaris missiles.
    British Foreign Secretary Home, supported by most of the European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, advised caution regarding the proposal of U.S. Secretary of State Herter. Defense ministers—especially Britain's Watkinson—are prepared to have a long-term dispute with the Americans over the fundamental goals of Western strategy.
    They were not overwhelmed by the American proposal to provide the North Atlantic Treaty Organization region with five Polaris submarines equipped with eighty missiles, because they understood that these submarines were not being given away.
    Britain opposes the North Atlantic Treaty Organization possessing nuclear submarines because there is no military justification for establishing them. There is no evidence that the contribution of the submarines would justify their cost, or the serious political problems that their appearance would cause.

European Partners Do Not Get Independent Control

    Excerpt from the December 19th West German "German Newspaper and Economic Newspaper"
    The ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries returned home with the same worries as when they went to Paris. Nothing has been decided. Regrettably, Herter's proposal was not considered far enough politically. In the consultative discussions on events not involving the scope of the alliance, Herter would not let people impose regulations on himself. When it comes to atomic weapons, he only put forward some suggestions that could also be achieved by the United States itself. The United States did not explicitly say whether it was willing to merge the close nuclear weapons system into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It (the United States) let European allies put forward a multilateral supervision system for atomic warheads. But on this matter, it seems that Washington will also demand a veto power within such a system. Frankly speaking, this would mean that European partners should pay for the five Polaris submarines and one hundred intermediate-range missiles that have been promised, without getting an independent, controlling power from the United States. This would be more of a financial integration than a political integration. But this issue must be decided in clearly defined political considerations. This is also the reason for Strauss' proposal to convene a meeting of the heads of government of all North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries.

### 从西方报纸看北大西洋集团理事会会议

    从西方报纸看北大西洋集团理事会会议
    十五个指头怎样按扳机？
    摘自12月18日美国《纽约时报》
    使北大西洋公约组织得到核能力引起了关于控制这些武器的这一令人为难而错综复杂的问题。一个由十五个成员国组成的联盟如何能够控制核武器的使用的问题，曾经由英国麦克米伦首相简单明了地说明过：有十五个指头按着扳机，还有十五个指头按住保险闸。一般的意见都认为，不能让这个联盟的所有成员国在紧急情况中行使控制权，这主要是由于要取得他们的意见的过程太花时间。
    因此就想出这种意见：由四、五个国家——美国、英国、法国、西德和一个小国家——来行使控制权。然而，北大西洋公约组织中的那些较小的国家认为这个办法赋予五国的权力太大了。大多数北大西洋公约组织国家中的左翼对于让西德分享核武器的控制权有所猜疑和恐惧。最后，在一个控制委员会得以组织以前，必须在美国获得国会的通过。
    在一点上说，北大西洋公约组织内部权力和影响发生转移的过程业已开始。西德由于提供了七师军队，它已在这个联盟之内要求得到并将得到更大的权力。与此同时，支付了过去十一年中大部分开支的美国，正在正当地要求其他成员国特别是西德增加财政上的贡献。
    批评这一点的欧洲人认为：北大西洋公约组织将在今后五年中转变成为一个由西德控制的联盟。某些人对这种情况感到害怕。
    美国核潜艇“贡献”抵不上费用
    摘自12月19日英国《每日邮报》
    英国故意冷淡美国的建议，即建立一支拥有一百枚以海洋为基地的北极星导弹的北大西洋公约组织核威慑力量的建议。
    英国外交大臣霍姆，在大多数北大西洋公约组织的欧洲成员国支持下，劝告要谨慎对待美国国务卿赫脱的建议。国防部长们——尤其是英国的沃金森——准备就西方战略的根本目标和美国人作长期争论。
    他们没有为美国给北大西洋公约组织地区提供装有八十枚导弹的五艘北极星潜艇的建议所压倒，因为他们了解这些潜艇并不是赠送的。
    英国反对北大西洋公约组织拥有核潜艇，是由于没有在军事上说明设立这些潜艇的理由。没有任何事实证明潜艇的贡献会抵得过它们的费用，或是它们的出现所将引起的严重政治问题。
    欧洲伙伴得不到独立支配权力
    摘自12月19日西德《德意志报与经济报》
    北大西洋公约组织国家的部长们带着与去巴黎时同样的忧虑回家去了。什么事情也没有决定。遗憾的是赫脱提出的建议从政治上看考虑得不够远。在关于不涉及联盟地区范围的事件的协商讨论中，赫脱不让人家给他自己作出规定。在涉及原子武器时，他只提出一些也同样可以由美国自己来实现的建议。美国并没有明确地说出，是否它愿意把紧密的核武器体系合并到北大西洋公约组织中去。它（美国）让欧洲盟国来提出关于原子弹头的多边的监督体系。但在这件事情上，看来可能华盛顿也将在这样一种体系内部要求有一种否决权。坦率地说这将意味着欧洲伙伴应当为已经答应了的五艘北极星潜水艇和一百个中程导弹付款，而不会从美国那里得到一种独立的、支配权力。这会是一种更多是财经上的一体化而不是政治上的一体化。但是这个问题必须在定义明确的政治考虑中决定。这也是施特劳斯提出召开所有北大西洋组织国家政府首脑会议的提案的理由。
