Xinhua News Agency, December 7th, TASS Moscow, December 7th: The full text of the speech delivered today by L. I. Brezhnev, Member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, at the banquet hosted by Chairman Liu Shaoqi is as follows:

    Dear Comrade Liu Shaoqi! Dear Comrades Li Jingquan, Lu Dingyi, Yang Shangkun, Liu Xiao, and Liu Ningyi! Dear Comrades and Friends!

    Please allow me to express my heartfelt thanks to Comrade Liu Shaoqi for his warm reception and for the passionate words he spoke about the Soviet Union and the fraternal friendship of our two peoples.

    The eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Soviet Union and China, the close unity of the socialist countries – this is a great achievement of the people of our countries, and we will continue to protect this great achievement as we would protect the apple of our eye.

    In the ranks of the united socialist camp, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, full of boundless energy, are moving forward and looking to the future with full confidence. As N. S. Khrushchev said, "There is no task that hundreds of millions of people who have broken free from the yoke of capitalist slavery cannot undertake."

    The achievements of the people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all other socialist countries in developing their economies and cultures vividly demonstrate the indisputable superiority of our advanced social system. Now, the world socialist system is becoming the decisive factor in the development of the entire human society.

    The socialist countries, due to their ever-growing strength and the implementation of a rational, truly humane foreign policy based on the Leninist principle of peaceful coexistence, have become a great attraction and hope for the vast majority of people in the world who yearn for peace. The people of all countries fighting to free themselves from imperialist and colonial oppression are looking to us. The socialist camp considers it its internationalist duty to give strong support to the people of these countries.

    Dear Comrades!

    In these days, the attention of the whole world is focused on the results of the just-concluded Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties.

    This meeting is an outstanding event in the international communist movement, marking a new historical milestone in its development.

    The Soviet people welcome the results of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties with great excitement. They are determined to fight with renewed energy for the realization of the great ideals proclaimed in the historic document of the meeting.

    We are deeply convinced that our just cause will surely triumph! The fraternal friendship and unity of the people of the socialist camp, and the growing strength and rock-solid unity of the world communist and workers' movement are the great guarantees of the victory of our cause.

    The visit of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation to the Soviet Union helps to further strengthen our friendship and unity.

    May the friendship between the Soviet Union and China, guided by the great communist ideology, grow and strengthen day by day! I propose a toast to the People's Republic of China! To the health of Comrade Liu Shaoqi and all members of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation! To the Government of the People's Republic of China! To the Communist Party of China and its Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong!

    勃列日涅夫在刘主席举行的宴会上讲话
    信心百倍地瞻望着未来
    新华社7日讯　塔斯社莫斯科7日电：苏共中央主席团委员、苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席勃列日涅夫今天在刘少奇主席举行的宴会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的刘少奇同志！亲爱的李井泉同志、陆定一同志、杨尚昆同志、
  刘晓同志和刘宁一同志！亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    请允许我衷心地感谢刘少奇同志的热诚接待以及他所说的关于苏联、关于我们两国人民的兄弟友谊的热情的话。
    苏联和中国永恒的和牢不可破的友谊，社会主义各国的紧密团结——这是我们这些国家人民的伟大成果，我们今后仍将像保护眼珠一样地保护这一伟大成果。
    在社会主义阵营各国的团结一致的行列中，精力无限充沛的苏联和中华人民共和国前进着，并信心百倍地瞻望着未来。正如尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫所说的，“挣脱了资本主义奴役枷锁的亿万人，没有什么担负不起的任务”。
    苏联、中华人民共和国和所有其他社会主义国家人民在发展经济和文化方面所取得的成就，鲜明地表明了我们先进的社会制度所具有的无可争辩的优越性。现在，世界社会主义体系正在成为整个人类社会发展的决定性因素。
    社会主义各国由于自己力量的不断壮大和执行建立在列宁主义和平共处原则上的理智的、真正人道的外交政策，对于渴望和平的世界绝大多数人民说来，已经成为伟大的吸引力和希望。为摆脱帝国主义和殖民主义压迫而斗争的各国人民的目光都投向我们。社会主义阵营各国认为，给予这些国家的人民以大力的支持是自己的国际主义职责。
    亲爱的同志们！
    在这些日子里，全世界的注意力都集中在刚刚闭幕的各国共产党和工人党代表会议的结果上。
    这次会议是国际共产主义运动中的卓越事件，它标志着国际共产主义运动的发展中的新的历史里程碑。
    苏联人民极其兴奋地欢迎各国共产党和工人党代表会议的成果。他们决心用新的精力为实现会议的历史性文件所宣布的伟大理想而斗争。
    我们深信，我们的正义事业一定获胜！社会主义阵营各国人民的兄弟友谊和团结以及世界共产主义运动和工人运动日益加强的威力和磐石般的团结，是我们事业取得胜利的伟大保证。
    中国党政代表团的访问苏联有助于进一步加强我们的友谊和团结。
    祝在伟大共产主义思想指导下的苏中友谊日益增进和加强！我提议，为中华人民共和国干杯！为刘少奇同志和中国党政代表团全体团员的健康干杯！为中华人民共和国政府干杯！为中国共产党及其以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会干杯！
