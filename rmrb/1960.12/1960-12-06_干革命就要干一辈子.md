    To Engage in Revolution is a Lifelong Commitment
    Shi Xiaomei
    Recently, I watched the movie "In the Name of the Revolution," which is very good. It is not only profoundly educational for the younger generation, but also very beneficial for those of us of this generation. When the October Revolution in the Soviet Union had just succeeded, the environment was extremely difficult, with each person only getting a few slices of black bread a day. But the Soviet people finally overcame the difficulties and emerged victoriously. Our environment today is much better than that of the Soviet Union back then. What difficulties can't we overcome? What particularly moved me was that the great revolutionary teacher Lenin shared the joys and hardships with everyone and shouldered extremely heavy work.
    I heard that some young people were very excited and shed tears on the spot after watching this movie, expressing their desire to learn from Petya and Vasya; however, after a few days, they raised concerns about not understanding the point of "struggling hard for generations." This is mainly because young people understand too little about the past, about life and struggle before liberation, and do not understand the meaning of hard struggle.
    Someone asked: To which generation will we not need to struggle hard? I want to ask them in return: To which generation will society no longer need to develop! In the old society, the common people wanted to live, to eat, and hoped to live a good life, so they had to make revolution and struggle hard. Today, the people's revolution has been victorious, and the people's lives have indeed improved, but does this mean that the revolution has reached its peak? No, far from it! There are two kinds of revolution: one is to make revolution against class enemies, and the other is to make revolution against nature. First, let's talk about the first kind of revolution. There are still imperialists abroad, and they are still bullying us; there are still classes at home, and we still have to struggle. The second kind of revolution, we have only just taken the first step. To push society forward and reach communism, there is still a long way to go, and we still have to overcome many difficulties, both large and small. We cannot be lazybones and dream of reaping without sowing. Some young people do not think this way. They have spent most of their time in the new society, and they don't know how much suffering the revolutionary struggle has gone through in the past, and how hard-won today's happy life is. Their minds are full of eating well and dressing beautifully, and they don't want to move forward anymore—in their words, it's called "settling down." How can this be allowed! Once, when I was speaking to young people, I said: "These people stop, but I won't stop. My family of eight, after making revolution, only I am left, and I will continue to make revolution, all the way to communism!"
    There are also a few young people who don't work hard but think that in the future, in communist society, they can do nothing, sit on the sofa, and press a button, and the air will turn into bread, and sausages will be delivered to their mouths. What kind of perspective is this for looking at communism! It is true that in the future communist society, life will be better than it is today. But all of that has to be earned through labor. "Diligent hands, diligent feet, diligent mouth," even if white rice falls from the sky, it still has to be cooked before it can be eaten. If your hands are not diligent and your feet are not diligent, and you only want to eat sausages, where do the sausages come from? Aren't they obtained through human labor! I think it's better to have fewer lazy fantasies and put more effort into thinking and using your hands in production and work, and do everything possible to improve production efficiency and save labor. This is the right thing to do!
    Once, I went to a university. A comrade told me that some college students were worried that after intellectuals become laborers, they would be the same as ordinary laborers, with no difference. He hoped that I would talk about my views on this issue. I said, this "same" is very good, and "no difference" is even better! Just because you have knowledge, does that mean you can be superior to others? In the past, going to college was to do things for the bourgeoisie; today, going to college is to do things for the proletariat. This is the most fundamental difference. To do things for the proletariat, students must integrate with the working people, put themselves among the working people, and not above the working people. To do things for the proletariat, students should make themselves ordinary laborers. They should have knowledge of both political struggle and productive labor; they should be able to work with both their brains and their hands; they should be both intellectuals and working people.
    The laborization of intellectuals is very important. Intellectuals must go to labor and learn from the working people, not only learning their production "skills," but more importantly, learning their ideological qualities. They must go to the most difficult places to temper their revolutionary will and revolutionary spirit, and transform their worldviews. "One who endures the greatest of hardships will become the greatest of people." This saying in the old society was to make people "great people" who exploit others, which is of course wrong. But today we need many "great people" for socialist construction, that is, people who charge forward and make great contributions to socialist construction. I hope that ambitious young people, through arduous training in production struggles and class struggles, will all become such "great people."
    Some young people don't compare themselves with others in terms of contribution, but in terms of enjoyment. Do we need to talk about food and clothing? Yes, we need to talk about it; but we cannot put it in the first place in life. Do we need to care about "suffering losses" and "gaining advantages"? Yes, we need to care about it; but first we must care about the losses and advantages of the collective, and not spend all day calculating personal gains. If we followed some people's thinking, then I would be the most "disadvantaged." For the revolution, three of my sons died in four months. But I don't feel disadvantaged by this, on the contrary, I feel that this is the greatest advantage. Although I lost my own children, I have many young people calling me "Mama Shi." I often receive letters from children from all over the country, and this is my greatest happiness. Someone asked me: "Why don't you live in Caoyang New Village?" I replied that today I can live in a house like the dormitory of the Sixth State Cotton Factory, which is already many times better than in the past. In the past, I spent the night under bridges, in iron pipes, under eaves, and on cement floors. Now our lives are constantly improving, but we must never forget the past. I have thought about living in Caoyang New Village; but when I see that many advanced workers who have made greater contributions than me have not yet moved into new workers' residences, I think they should be the first to move in! A few years ago, a laboring sister helped me with housework. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, I thought: I myself come from the working people, and I can cope with cooking and wiping tables, these housework; I suggested that she go and participate in socialist construction. In this way, although I have to be a little busier myself, I feel very happy inside. Accelerating socialist construction is not just empty talk. Every practical struggle in daily life is testing everyone. As long as we have a shred of enthusiasm, we must emit a shred of light! Only in this way can we be worthy of the martyrs and worthy of future generations.

    干革命就要干一辈子
    施小妹
    最近，我看了电影《以革命的名义》，这部电影很好。它不仅对年青一代有深刻的教育意义，就是对我们这一辈人，也很有好处。苏联在十月革命刚刚成功的时候，环境非常困难，每个人一天只有几片黑面包。但是苏联人民终于战胜了困难，胜利地走过来了。我们今天的环境，比起苏联的当年来，那是好得多了，我们有什么困难不能克服呢？特别使我感动的是，伟大的革命导师列宁，也和大家一样，同甘共苦，还担负着极繁重的工作。
    听说有些青年人看了这部电影后，当场十分激动，流下了眼泪，表示要向彼加和瓦夏学习；可是，过了几天，却又提出对“代代要艰苦奋斗”这一点想不通。这主要是因为青年人对过去、对解放以前的生活和斗争懂得太少，不懂得艰苦奋斗的意义。
    有人问：到哪一代可以不要艰苦奋斗了呢？我要反问他：到哪一代，社会才不要发展了呢！在旧社会，老百姓要活命，要吃饭，希望过好日子，所以要革命，要艰苦奋斗。今天人民革命胜利了，人民的生活的确好起来了，但是难道这样革命就算到顶了？不，差得远呢！革命有两种，一种是革阶级敌人的命，另一种是革大自然的命。先说第一种革命，国外还有帝国主义存在，它们还在欺负我们；国内还有阶级存在，我们还要斗争。第二种革命，我们还刚走出第一步，要推动社会向前发展，要走到共产主义，还有一段不短的路程，还得克服许许多多大大小小的困难，我们不能做懒汉，空想坐享其成。有些年轻人却不是这样想。他们大部分时间是在新社会度过的，不知道过去革命斗争经历过多少困苦，今天幸福生活来之不易，脑子里尽想吃得好，穿得漂亮，不想再前进了——用他们的话来说叫“思想笃定”。这怎么行啊！我有一次在向青年们讲话的时候曾经这样说：“这些人停了，我可不停。我的一家八口人，闹革命闹剩了我一个，我还要革命下去，一直到共产主义！”
    还有少数青年人，不好好劳动，却想将来到了共产主义社会就可以啥也不做，坐在沙发里，一按电钮，空气就会变面包，香肠就会送到嘴边来。这是用什么观点来看待共产主义啊！不错，到了将来共产主义社会，日子要比今天更好过。但是那一切都得用劳动去换来。“手勤脚勤口才勤”，就是白米从天上掉下来，也还得烧熟了才能吃。手不勤，脚也不勤，只想吃香肠，香肠从哪儿来？还不是通过人的劳动才得来的！我看还是少一点懒汉的幻想，在生产中、工作中多动脑筋，多动双手，千方百计提高生产效率，节约劳动力，这才是正经事！
    有一次，我到一个大学里去。有位同志告诉我，有些大学生担心知识分子劳动化以后便同普通劳动者一律了，没有什么差别了。他希望我对这个问题谈谈自己的看法。我说，这“一律”很好嘛，“没有什么差别”更好嘛！有了知识，难道就可以高人一等吗？过去上大学是为了替资产阶级做事情；今天上大学是为了替无产阶级做事情，这是一个最根本的不同。要为无产阶级做事情，学生们就要同劳动人民打成一片，把自己放在劳动人民之中，而不放在劳动人民之上。要为无产阶级做事情，学生们就应该使自己成为普通劳动者。既有政治斗争的知识，又有生产劳动的知识；既能用脑劳动，又能用手劳动；既是知识分子，又是劳动人民。
    知识分子劳动化是非常重要的。知识分子一定要到劳动中去向劳动人民学习，不仅学习他们的生产“本事”，更重要的是学习他们的思想品质。一定要到最艰苦的地方去锻炼自己的革命毅力、革命精神，改造自己的世界观。“吃得苦中苦，方为人上人。”旧社会里的这句话，是要人们做剥削别人的“人上人”，这当然不对。但是我们今天需要许多社会主义建设的“人上人”，也就是为社会主义建设打冲锋、立大功的人。希望有志气的青年人在生产斗争里、在阶级斗争里通过艰苦的锻炼，都成为这样的“人上人”。
    有些青年，不是同别人比贡献，而是比享受。我们要不要讲吃穿？要讲；但不能把它排在生活的第一位。我们要不要计较“吃亏”与“便宜”？要计较；但首先要计较集体的吃亏和便宜，而不要一天到晚打个人的小算盘。如果按照某些人的想法，那我是最“吃亏”的了。为了革命，四个月里死了三个儿子。但我并不以此为吃亏，反而觉得这是最大的便宜。我虽然失去了自己的亲生儿女，但有许许多多青年人喊我“施妈妈”。我经常收到孩子们从各地写给我的信，这也就是我最大的幸福。有人问我：“为什么你不去住曹杨新村？”我回答说，今天我能住国棉六厂宿舍这样的房子，已经比过去不知好了多少倍。过去我在桥底下过夜，铁管子里过夜，屋檐下过夜，水门汀上过夜。现在我们的生活在不断提高，但决不要忘掉过去。住曹杨新村，我也想过；但是当我看到有许多贡献比我大的先进工作者还没有住进新的工人住宅，我就想应该让他们先去住！前几年，有一个劳动大姐帮我料理家务。1958年大跃进的时候，我想：我自己是劳动人民出身，做做饭，抹抹桌子，这些家务劳动可以对付过去；我就建议让她去参加社会主义建设。这一来，自己虽然要忙一点，但是内心却很愉快。加快社会主义建设，这不是一句空话。日常的每一项实际斗争都在考验着每一个人。只要我们还有一分热，就要发一分光！这样，才对得起先烈，对得起子孙后代。
