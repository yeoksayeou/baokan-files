Xinhua News Agency, December 6th. TASS, Moscow, December 5th: The Soviet government's statement on the situation in the Congo:

	Recent developments in the Congo show that the colonialist countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, led by the United States, have openly embarked on the path of eliminating the parliament of the Republic of the Congo and the legitimate government headed by Lumumba, and of eliminating the national independence won by the Congolese people. The arrest and torture of Prime Minister Lumumba, Speaker of the Senate Okito, Speaker of the House of Representatives Kasongo, and many ministers and members of parliament loyal to their people, as well as the terrorist activities of the colonialists and their hired agents in the country, indicate that the imperialist aggression against the Republic of the Congo by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization under the cover of the United Nations flag has entered a new and more acute stage.

	The colonialists intend to physically eliminate the national leaders of the Congo and the political leaders of the Congolese people in order to allow lackeys like Mobutu and Tshombe to occupy their positions. In order to achieve this despicable goal, they also used Kasavubu, a traitor to the Congolese people. In fact, this is to restore the power of the old (Belgian) and new (American) colonialist administrative authorities in the Congo. The old and new colonialists are colluding and taking concerted action with the colonialist authorities of Portugal, Britain, and France in Africa. Thousands of Belgian colonial officials, "advisers," officers, judges, business owners, and farmers who were driven out by the Congolese people have returned to the Congo and are operating there under the cover of the United Nations military headquarters and Mr. Hammarskjöld's official representatives.

	When the imperialist countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization launched a colonialist adventure in the Congo in July of this year, they formulated a plan to swiftly strangle the independence of the Republic of the Congo, and then strangle the independence of many other African countries. This plan was shattered by the Congolese people and the people of socialist countries and independent Asian and African countries friendly to the Congolese people.

	The colonialists disarmed the troops loyal to the legitimate government of Lumumba, pieced together mercenary gangs composed of Congolese social dregs and foreign adventurers and mercenaries transferred from Brazzaville, and attempted to reimplement their conspiracy. The situation formed in the Congo is first and foremost the result of the current US government's blatant and crude interference in the Congo's internal affairs. It is well known that the US Embassy in Leopoldville openly carries out criminal activities against the Congolese parliament and government. The US Embassy, acting jointly with the Belgians, is like a command center, from which a large amount of money flows out continuously to fund the colonialists' banditry in the Congo.

	In fact, the power and equity capital among the major colonialist countries of the United States, Belgium, Britain, and France are changing in the Congo. The plunder of the Congo's wealth is the basis for the rampant dominance and crimes of the colonialists and their lackeys in the Congo. The main culprits and organizers of the Congo tragedy are the big monopoly organizations, the robbers of money bags, and the safes of banks in Belgium, the United States, Britain, and France. All the rest is decoration and hypocritical whitewash.

	The people of Africa, Asia, and the world see in the example of the Congo that after escaping from one prison, it may fall into another cell, under the ravages of the old colonialists colluding with the new colonialists.

	The tragedy of the Congo is displayed before the whole world. There is no doubt that, based on the experience gained by the people of various countries, the events currently happening in the Congo are not the end, but the beginning of a tenacious struggle. The people of all countries draw rich and valuable lessons for themselves from today's events in the Congo. What are these lessons?

	The first thing the Congo incident teaches people is that colonialists will not voluntarily surrender anything. Every concession is obtained by the people with violence, and every step towards freedom is obtained from struggle. The Congo incident is rapidly dispelling the patriarchal faith that still remains in some places in the oppressors of many centuries and their servants - Mr. Hammarskjöld, Tshombe, and Kasavubu. In order to plunder, colonialists always use the dispersion and contradictions between races, parties, and groups, use the tolerance and lack of determination of individual national freedom fighters, use their naive trust in the laws formulated by colonialists, use individuals who think of an important role in the events, use their incompetence and their reluctance to subordinate the actions and personal interests to the national interests of the common struggle to win independence and consolidate independence.

	The Congo incident is dispelling the servile spirit inherited from the past colonialism, the naive trust in the promises made by colonialists on the UN podium, and the unconditional submission that still exists among certain classes in African society, and not only in African society. The African people are watching with angry eyes the colonialists and their lackeys who are currently gaining the upper hand in Leopoldville. Moreover, the masses of the people are increasingly aware of the need for fundamental changes, and increasingly aware that the colonial system cannot continue to be retained, and that there can be no reconciliation between the old slavery system and the new freedom system.

	Colonialism regards poverty, disease, ignorance, betrayal, chains, and gallows as its allies in Africa. Barbaric, brutal fascist-style reaction and colonialist enslavement are the ideals of the colonialists. However, in our era, the people of all countries need independence and freedom as much as they need to breathe. They not only no longer believe in the firmness of the chains of colonialism, but have already broken a large part of these chains. Therefore, when a Congolese patriot is put in jail, when an activist is tortured or sentenced by colonialists and their lackeys, there will inevitably be thousands upon thousands of new, more resolute, more organized fighters who have accumulated the experience of their predecessors rising up to replace them.

	The names of Lumumba, Gizenga, Okito, Kasongo, and Mopolo have become the flags of Africa in struggle, and it is impossible to tear them down now.

	Help from independent African countries, especially from Ghana, Guinea, the United Arab Republic, Morocco, Sudan, Ethiopia, and Mali, plays a huge role in defending the independence of the Republic of the Congo. No wonder, Hammarskjöld, fearing the role of African countries in the Congo, constantly sent American, Canadian, Swedish, Irish, and other military personnel and officials loyal to foreign monopolies there. No wonder, now the colonialists, in an attempt to restore the colonial system in the Republic of the Congo, are striving to first isolate the Congo from its most reliable African friends - Ghana, Guinea, the United Arab Republic, and other countries - and are trying their best to withdraw the troops of these independent countries from the territory of the Congo.

	However, not all African and Asian countries have always maintained the necessary unity in defending the sovereignty of the Republic of the Congo, which has become a victim of imperialist aggression. In order to plunder, colonialist countries cunningly use the differences that sometimes arise between Asian and African countries, use the mistaken belief in the "fairness" of the executive bodies of the United Nations by some of them, and their trust in the obviously false reports about the domestic situation in the Congo by colonialist countries.

	If Asian and African countries could maintain the kind of unity and steadfastness they showed with socialist countries during the Suez Crisis in the autumn of 1956, then the imperialists' criminal conspiracy in the Congo would not have been able to succeed at all.

	The Congo incident clearly confirms the correctness of the Soviet government's position from the beginning of the imperialist aggression against the Republic of the Congo, and confirms that the Soviet Union's resolute and consistent condemnation of the actions of UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, who played the role of a colonialist lackey, is well-founded and necessary.

	The following facts eloquently illustrate the shameful role played by the UN Secretary-General and his representatives in the Congo: When it was already known that the Mobutu bandits, who were pieced together and supported by the colonialists, had arrested Prime Minister Lumumba, the UN representatives resolutely denied the news that had already been released, as if they had intended to stop the atrocities of the aforementioned bandits and help the Prime Minister. They also boasted that they were "not interfering" in this matter. This once again proves that the servant role of the UN representatives, or more precisely the representatives of the colonialists, in the Congo has been fully exposed.

	When true non-interference was needed so that the legitimate government could exercise its functions, the UN representatives grossly interfered in the affairs of the Congo and paralyzed the work of this government. And when it was necessary to protect the head of government and other members of the Congo parliament and government from the persecution of imperialists and colonialists, they conversely showed "non-interference," which in fact was to condone these imperialists and colonialists in their atrocities. It is precisely because of such actions by UN representatives, including the UN Secretary-General, that they and the troops they commanded in the Congo, dispatched there under the resolutions of the Security Council, not only failed to fulfill the mandate of the Security Council - to end the aggression against the Republic of the Congo, and to defend its independence and territorial integrity - but became tools of the aggressors and colonialists.

	The danger facing the Republic of the Congo is also a danger to the independence of Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, Morocco, Guinea, and other African countries, and a danger to the cause of peace in Africa and the world. This necessitates strengthening the unity and organization of the people of all countries engaged in the anti-colonial struggle.

	The recent actions by the colonialists in the Congo, attempting to restore the colonial system in this country, are taking place at a time when the 15th session of the UN General Assembly is discussing the declaration on granting independence to colonial countries and peoples proposed by Soviet government head Khrushchev. The Soviet proposal has received broad support from all independent countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The actions of colonialist countries in the Congo show that they disregard the opinions of the vast majority of countries in the world, disregard the will of the people of all countries, and disregard the principles of the UN Charter.

	The events currently happening in the Congo once again prove that there is sufficient reason to demand the elimination of colonialism in the declaration on granting independence to colonial countries and peoples proposed by the Soviet Union. This declaration is a programmatic document for the struggle of the people of all countries in the world against colonial slavery.

	There is no doubt that the people of all countries will turn to attack the shameful colonial system, striving to remove the strongholds and military bases of colonialists in various regions of the world, and striving to completely eliminate colonialism, in order to counter the attempts of colonialists to restore the old system in the Congo. The colonialists should understand the truth that now is not the 19th century, and no colonialist expedition and no criminal activities like the ones they have committed in the Republic of the Congo can go unpunished. The people of all countries in the world will respond to every blow aimed against the freedom of the people of all countries with a greater counterattack. The criminal activities of the aggressors and their lackeys will themselves teach them a good lesson.

	The people of all countries have the right to demand that the United Nations take resolute action against those aggressors and colonialist perpetrators who attempt to strangle the independence of the Republic of the Congo. The situation formed in the Congo requires immediate action. First of all, it is necessary:

	First, to immediately release Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba, Speaker of the Senate Okito, Speaker of the House of Representatives Kasongo, and other ministers and members of parliament, and at the same time take necessary measures to restore the activities of the legitimate government and parliament of the Republic of the Congo.

	Second, the troops stationed in the Congo, sent there under the resolutions of the Security Council, must immediately disarm the Mobutu bandits who are carrying out terrorist activities.

	Third, to establish a special committee composed of representatives from African and Asian countries to thoroughly investigate the financial sources and weapons sources of the Mobutu elements.

	Fourth, to expel all Belgian soldiers and officials from the Congo, in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council and the special session of the United Nations General Assembly.

	Fifth, in order to implement these and other urgent measures, the Soviet government proposes to immediately discuss the situation in the Republic of the Congo in the Security Council and the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly.

	The Soviet Union will give all possible friendly assistance and support to the people of the Republic of the Congo who are engaged in the anti-colonial struggle.

	The Soviet people are convinced that the Congolese people's struggle for their freedom and independence will surely be victorious, and that the colonialists will be driven out of the Congo and other countries that are still under the shackles of colonial slavery. One day, these shackles will burst into pieces, and the sun of freedom will shine on the places where destroyers and executioners still run rampant today.

    苏联政府发表声明谴责帝国主义国家利用联合国侵略刚果
    刚果事件是美国新殖民主义者干涉活动的结果
    殖民主义者不会自愿交出任何东西　人民只有从战斗中才能向自由迈进
    新华社6日讯　塔斯社莫斯科5日讯：苏联政府关于刚果局势的声明：
    最近几天刚果的事态表明，以美国为首的北大西洋公约组织殖民主义国家公然走上了消灭刚果共和国议会和以卢蒙巴为首的合法政府的道路，走上了消灭刚果人民赢得的民族独立的道路。逮捕和折磨卢蒙巴总理、刚果参议院议长奥基托、众议院议长卡松戈和许多忠于本国人民的部长和议员，以及殖民主义者及其雇佣的代理人在国内的恐怖活动说明，北大西洋公约组织在联合国旗帜的掩护下对刚果共和国进行的帝国主义侵略进入了一个新的、更加尖锐的阶段。
    殖民主义者打算从肉体上消除刚果的国家领导人和刚果人民的政治领袖，以便让蒙博托和冲伯之流的仆从占据这些人的地位。为了达到这一卑鄙的目的，他们还利用了刚果人民的叛徒卡萨武布。实际上这是要恢复旧的（比利时）和新的（美国）殖民主义者在刚果的殖民主义行政当局的权力，新老殖民主义者是串通的，并且是同葡萄牙、英国和法国在非洲的殖民主义当局采取一致行动的。被刚果人民赶出去的数千名比利时殖民主义官员、“顾问”、军官、法官、企业主和农场主已经回到刚果，并在联合国军队司令部和哈马舍尔德先生的正式代表的掩护下在那里进行活动。
    北大西洋公约组织的帝国主义国家今年7月在刚果开始殖民主义冒险行动的时候，就制定了计划，想闪电般地扼杀刚果共和国的独立，然后扼杀其他许多非洲国家的独立。这一计划被刚果人民和同刚果人民友好的社会主义国家人民和亚非独立国家人民粉碎了。
    殖民主义者解除了忠于卢蒙巴合法政府的军队的武装，由刚果的社会渣滓和经过布拉柴维尔调来的外国冒险分子和雇佣兵拼凑成雇佣匪帮，企图重新实现他们的阴谋。在刚果形成的局势首先是现在的美国政府公然粗暴地干涉刚果国家内政的结果。众所周知，美国驻利奥波德维尔的大使馆对刚果议会和政府公开地进行罪恶活动，美国大使馆同比利时人共同行动，像是一个指挥中心，从那里，大批金钱源源不绝地流出，资助殖民主义者在刚果进行匪盗活动。
    实际上，美国、比利时、英国和法国各大殖民主义国家之间的势力和股份资本在刚果正在发生变化。对刚果财富的掠夺就是目前在刚果的殖民主义者和他们的走狗横行霸道和犯罪的基础。刚果悲剧的主要祸首和组织者就是比利时、美国、英国和法国的大垄断组织、钱袋的强盗和银行的保险柜。所有其余的东西都是装璜和虚伪的粉饰。
    非洲、亚洲和世界各国人民都看到刚果这个例子，它在摆脱一个监狱之后，可能落进另一个牢房，处于同新的殖民主义者勾结的旧殖民主义者的蹂躏之下。
    刚果的悲剧在全世界的面前展示出来。毫无疑问，根据各国人民所取得的经验，目前刚果发生的事件并不是结束，而是顽强斗争的开始。各国人民从刚果今天的事件中为自己得出丰富的和宝贵的教训。这些教训是什么呢？
    刚果事件教导人们的首先是，殖民主义者是不会自愿交出任何东西的。每一个让步都是靠人民用暴力取得的，每向自由迈进一步都是从战斗中取得的。刚果事件使在某些地方还保留着对多世纪的压迫者和他们的奴仆——哈马舍尔德、冲伯、卡萨武布之流的先生们的那种宗法式信仰的思想迅速地消散。殖民主义者为了掠夺，总是利用种族、党派和团体之间的分散性和矛盾，利用个别的民族自由战士的宽容和缺乏决心，利用他们对殖民主义者制定的法律的幼稚的信任，利用在事件中想起重要作用的个别人，利用他们的无能和他们不愿使自己的行动和个人利益服从于争取独立和巩固独立的共同斗争的民族利益。
    刚果事件正在打消着非洲社会，而且不仅是非洲社会，某些阶层人士中尚存的、从过去殖民主义那里继承下来的奴才精神、对殖民主义者在联合国讲台上发出的诺言的天真的信赖和无条件的屈服。非洲人民都在以愤怒的目光注视着殖民主义者及其目前在利奥波德维尔占上风的走狗们。而且人民群众越来越意识到有必要进行根本的转变，越来越意识到殖民主义制度不能继续保留，旧的奴役制度与新的自由制度之间不可能调和。
    殖民主义把贫困、疾病、愚昧、叛变、锁链和绞架看作是自己在非洲的同盟者。野蛮的、粗暴的法西斯式的反动和殖民主义的奴役统治是殖民主义者的理想。但是，在我们这个时代里，各国人民需要独立和自由，就像需要呼吸一样。他们不仅再不相信殖民主义的锁链的牢固了，而且已经打断了这些锁链的一大部分。所以，当一个刚果爱国者被关进牢狱里时，当一个活动家受到殖民主义者和他们的走狗的折磨或判处时，就必然有千千万万个新的、更加坚决的、积有自己先驱者的经验的、更加有组织的战士起而代之。
    卢蒙巴、基赞加、奥基托、卡松戈、莫波洛的名字已经成为正在斗争中的非洲的旗帜，而且现在要扯下它是不可能的。
    来自非洲独立国家的帮助，特别是来自加纳、几内亚、阿联、摩洛哥、苏丹、埃塞俄比亚、马里的帮助，在捍卫刚果共和国的独立方面起着巨大的作用。难怪，哈马舍尔德由于害怕非洲国家对刚果的作用，便不断往那里派遣美国、加拿大、瑞典、爱尔兰和其他忠实于外国大垄断组织的军事人员和官员。难怪，现在殖民主义者为了企图在刚果共和国恢复殖民主义制度，正在竭力首先使刚果同它最可靠的非洲朋友——加纳、几内亚、阿联和其他国家隔绝和极力要使这些独立国家的军队撤出刚果领土。
    但是，并不是所有非洲和亚洲国家都一直维护在保卫已成为帝国主义侵略的牺牲品的刚果共和国的主权方面必要的团结一致。为了进行掠夺，殖民主义国家狡猾地利用亚非国家间有时出现的分歧，利用其中的某些国家对联合国执行机构的“公正”的错误的相信和它们对殖民主义国家关于刚果国内局势的显然是虚假的报道的信任。
    如果亚非国家能保持1956年秋天苏伊士危机时它们同社会主义国家在一起所表现出的那种团结和坚定，那么，帝国主义者在刚果的罪恶阴谋是根本不能得逞的。
    刚果事件十分明显地证实了苏联政府从帝国主义一开始对刚果共和国进行侵略时所持的立场的正确性，证实了，苏联对扮演了殖民主义者走狗角色的、联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的行动的坚决而一贯的谴责是理由充足和必要的。
    下面的事实就雄辩地说明了联合国秘书长和他在刚果的代表所扮演的可耻角色：当已经知道殖民主义者所拼凑和豢养的蒙博托匪徒逮捕了卢蒙巴总理的时候，联合国的代表便坚决地对已经传出的消息辟谣，好像他们曾经打算阻止上述匪帮的暴行和帮助总理。他们还夸耀说，他们对这件事“不干涉”。这又一次证明，联合国的代表，更确切地说是殖民主义者的代表的奴仆作用在刚果已经原形毕露。
    当需要真正的不干涉、以便使合法政府能够行使自己的职能的时候，联合国代表却粗暴地干涉刚果事务，并使这个政府的工作处于瘫痪状态。而当需要保护政府首脑和刚果议会和政府的其他人员免遭帝国主义者和殖民主义者的迫害的时候，却相反地表现了“不干涉”，而实际上这是纵容这些帝国主义者和殖民主义者行凶。正是由于包括联合国秘书长在内的联合国代表的这种行动，他们和他们在刚果所指挥的、根据安理会的决议调来的军队，不仅没有完成安理会的委托——结束对刚果共和国的侵略，保卫它的独立和领土完整，反而成了侵略者和殖民主义者的工具。
    刚果共和国所面临的危险同时也是尼日利亚、塞内加尔、加纳、摩洛哥、几内亚和其他非洲国家的独立的危险，是非洲和世界和平事业的危险。这就有必要加强进行反殖民主义斗争的各国人民的团结和组织性。
    殖民主义者最近在刚果所进行的想在这个国家恢复殖民主义制度的行动发生的时候，正是联合国大会第十五届会议讨论苏联政府首脑赫鲁晓夫提出的给予殖民地国家和人民独立的宣言的时候。苏联的建议得到了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲所有独立国家的广泛支持。殖民主义国家在刚果的行动表明，它们无视世界绝大多数国家的意见，无视各国人民的意志以及联合国宪章原则。
    刚果现在发生的事件再一次地证明，在苏联提出的给予殖民地国家和民族独立的宣言里要求消灭殖民主义是有充分理由的，这个宣言是全世界各国人民反对殖民主义奴役斗争的纲领性文件。
    毫无疑问，各国人民将转而进攻可耻的殖民主义制度，争取撤除殖民主义者在世界各个地区的据点和军事基地、争取彻底消灭殖民主义，以此来反击殖民主义者在刚果恢复旧制度的企图。殖民主义者应该明白这样一个真理，即现在不是十九世纪了，任何一个殖民主义的讨伐队和任何一个像他们在刚果共和国所干的那种罪恶活动都不能使他们白白过去的，世界各国人民将以更大的反击来回答每个旨在反对各国人民自由的打击。侵略者及其走狗的罪恶活动本身就会使他们好好领教这一点。
    各国人民有权要求联合国采取坚决行动来反对那些企图扼杀刚果共和国独立的侵略者和殖民主义暴行者。刚果所形成的局势要求立即采取这样的行动。首先必须：
    第一，立即释放刚果共和国总理卢蒙巴、参议院议长奥基托、众议院议长卡松戈和其他部长和议员，同时采取必要措施恢复刚果共和国合法政府和议会的活动。
    第二，由驻在刚果的、根据安理会的决议派到那里去的军队，立即解除进行恐怖活动的蒙博托匪徒的武装。
    第三，成立由非洲和亚洲国家代表组成的特别委员会，详细地调查蒙博托分子的财政来源和武器来源。
    第四，根据联合国安理会和联合国大会特别会议的决议，从刚果驱逐所有比利时军人和官员。
    第五，为了实现这些和其他刻不容缓的措施，苏联政府建议立即在安理会和联合国大会第十五届会议上讨论刚果共和国的局势问题。
    苏联将对进行反殖民主义斗争的刚果共和国人民给予一切可能的友好援助和支持。
    苏联人民坚信，刚果人民争取本国自由和独立的斗争必将胜利，殖民主义者将被赶出刚果和仍处在殖民主义奴役枷锁下的其他国家。总有一天，这些枷锁砰然迸裂成碎片，自由的阳光会照耀在今天还有摧残者和刽子手横行无忌的地方。
