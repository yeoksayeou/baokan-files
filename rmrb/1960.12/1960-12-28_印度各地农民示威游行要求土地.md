Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 26th: Farmers in various parts of India are urgently demanding land and the abolition of feudal exploitation.

According to Bombay's *Free Press Journal*, 1,500 poor peasant representatives from hundreds of villages in Kolhapur County, Bombay State, held a demonstration on December 11th, strongly demanding land from landlords and government wasteland. They also submitted a memorandum to the local government on this issue. According to the newspaper, about 1,000 landless peasants in the county, along with their wives and children, sat in front of a landlord's residence in mid-December, protesting his eviction. The newspaper also stated that about 150 farmer representatives from Wardha County, Maharashtra State, passed a resolution at a meeting in mid-December demanding land. Gaikwad, the general secretary of the state's farmers' association, spoke at the meeting, calling on landless peasants to wage a resolute struggle until they obtain land.

According to New Delhi's Urdu weekly *People's Century*, agricultural workers from 25 villages in Kner County, Uttar Pradesh, passed a resolution at a recent rally demanding that government wasteland and landlords' surplus land be distributed to agricultural workers and poor peasants. According to the Bengali newspaper *Freedom Daily*, thousands of farmer representatives from West Bengal recently joined the working people of Calcutta in a demonstration on the streets of Calcutta, demanding genuine land reform. These farmer representatives had traveled from their villages, walking for one or two, or even four days, to Calcutta to participate in the demonstration.

According to *Crossroads*, farmers in various parts of northern West Bengal are also engaged in a struggle against feudal landlords who are attempting to use deceptive means to deprive farmers of their due share in this year's harvest.

Land ownership in India is highly concentrated. Landlords and rich peasants, who account for 10% of the agricultural population, own 85% of the country's cultivated land. Among them, large landlords, who account for 2% of the agricultural population, own 70% of the country's cultivated land, while poor and hired peasants and middle peasants, who account for 90% of the agricultural population, own only 15% of the country's cultivated land.

    印度各地农民示威游行要求土地
    据新华社26日讯　新德里消息：印度各地农民迫切要求获得土地和取消封建剥削。
    据孟买的《自由新闻》报道，孟买邦科拉浦尔县数百个村中的一千五百名贫农代表在12月11日举行了示威游行，强烈要求获得地主的土地和政府的荒地。他们还就这个问题向当地政府提出了一项备忘录。据这家报纸报道，这个县约一千名无地的农民在12月中旬曾经带着妻子和儿女坐在一名地主住宅的前面，抗议他夺佃的行动。这家报纸还说，马哈拉施特拉邦华尔达县约一百五十名农民代表在12月中旬举行的一次会议上通过决议，要求获得土地。这个邦的农民协会总书记盖克瓦德在会上讲话时，号召无地的农民进行坚决的斗争，直到获得土地时为止。
    据新德里乌尔都文《人民世纪》周刊报道，印度北方邦克内尔县二十五个村的农业工人在最近举行的集会上通过决议，要求把政府的荒地和地主的多余土地分配给农业工人和贫农。据孟加拉文《自由报》报道，西孟加拉邦的数千名农民代表最近同加尔各答的劳动人民一道，在加尔各答街头举行示威游行，要求进行真正的土地改革。这些农民代表都是从他们所住的村庄出发，徒步一、两天甚至四天到加尔各答参加示威游行的。
    据《划时代报》报道，在西孟加拉邦北部各地，农民们也在进行反对封建地主的斗争，因为这些封建地主企图用欺骗的手段来剥夺农民们在今年收成中应得的部分。
    印度土地占有情况十分集中。占农业人口10％的地主和富农占有全国耕地面积的85％，其中占农业人口2％的大地主，占有全国耕地的70％，而占农业人口90％的贫、雇农和中农只占有全国耕地面积的15％。
