    Grasp One Key, Concentrate Efforts to Break Through One Key
    Hunan Agricultural Machinery Plant Greatly Increases Production Capacity

    (Our newspaper, Changsha, 30th) The Hunan Agricultural Machinery Plant comprehensively fulfilled the national plan by December 10th, with product output (calculated by horsepower) exceeding the annual plan by 21.5%; all factory products were of qualified quality; labor productivity increased by 100% compared to last year; product costs also decreased by 47.7% compared to last year; and profits delivered to the state exceeded the annual plan by 9.94%.

    The main reason the Hunan Agricultural Machinery Plant was able to complete this year's plan ahead of schedule and exceed targets was the mass movement of technical revolution. By the beginning of December, the entire factory had realized more than 21,900 innovation proposals, and had moved from the original general single-item technical innovations to the transformation of entire machines, equipment, production processes, production technology, and product structure, greatly increasing the factory's production capacity.

    This factory insisted on grasping one key, concentrating efforts to break through one key, and then breaking through another key, so that the technical revolution movement developed steadily. This year, the factory's main product – the 4160-type gas engine – had a large production task, requiring increased processing equipment, raw materials, and labor. In order to break through this key, the factory Party committee mobilized the masses to carry out product revolution. Wang Zhiguo, the secretary of the Party committee, went to the test run group of the assembly workshop to hold a "three-in-one" meeting, adopting a small 8-horsepower motor as power to replace the original more complex starting part, reducing 216 parts and components, saving more than 640 kilograms of steel, and also compressing more than 210 work hours. This successful experiment greatly encouraged the confidence of the factory workers in innovating technology. The workers immediately began to reform the design of the main part of this machine – the clutch. The innovated clutch reduced 85 parts and 174 kilograms of steel compared to the original old-fashioned clutch, saving more than 90 work hours. Subsequently, the workers carried out four more innovations on this gas engine. Finally, the production time for each of these products was compressed to 942 hours, reducing more than 520 operations, saving more than 1,480 kilograms of steel per unit, and the products produced were economical, practical, of good quality, and very popular with farmers.

### 抓住一个关键　集中力量突破一个关键  湖南农业机械厂生产能力大提高

    抓住一个关键　集中力量突破一个关键
    湖南农业机械厂生产能力大提高
    本报长沙30日电　湖南农业机械厂已经在12月10日全面完成国家计划，产品产量（按马力计算）超过年计划的21.5％；出厂产品质量全部合格；劳动生产率比去年提高一倍；产品成本也比去年下降47.7％；上缴利润超过年计划9.94％。
    湖南农业机械厂能够提前超额完成今年计划的主要原因，是大搞技术革命的群众运动。到12月初止，全厂共实现革新建议两万一千九百多条，并且由原来一般单项的技术革新，进入到整个机器设备、生产工艺、生产技术、产品结构的改造，大大提高了全厂的生产能力。
    这个厂坚持抓住一个关键，集中力量突破一个关键，再突破一个关键，使技术革命运动稳步发展。这个厂今年的主要产品——四一六零型煤气机的生产任务很大，必须增加加工设备、原材料和劳动力。为了突破这个关键，工厂党委发动群众进行产品革命。党委书记王治国到装配车间试车小组召开三结合会议，采用八马力的小马达作动力代替原来构造较复杂的启动部分，减少了二百一十六个零件和部件，节约了六百四十多公斤钢材，还压缩了二百一十多个工时。这一成功的试验，大大鼓舞了全厂职工革新技术的信心。职工们立即动手改革这种机器的主要部分——离合器的设计。革新后的离合器比原来老式离合器减少八十五个零件、一百七十四公斤钢材，节省了九十多个工时。接着，职工们对这种煤气机又进行了四次革新。最后，这种产品每台的生产时间压缩到九百四十二小时，减少五百二十多个作号，每台节约一千四百八十多公斤钢材，而且生产的产品经济、适用、质量好，很受农民的欢迎。
