    Naive Operations Research Thinking
    Mian Ling
    Currently, some economic sectors are employing a young science—operations research—to rationally arrange and dispatch manpower and materials. Recently, the 20th-21st issues of "Red Flag" published an article by Comrade Liu Jiping, Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, introducing the content, role, and promotion experience of operations research. The article cited the horse racing strategy proposed by Sun Bin, a famous ancient Chinese military strategist, to illustrate that there were naive operations research ideas at that time.
    The bud of this kind of thinking did indeed emerge very early and has been developing slowly ever since. The method used by Ding Wei of the Song Dynasty to handle the materials and transportation work for the construction of palaces was clearly a prototype of linear programming. This story is recorded in Volume 2 of Shen Kuo's "Meng Xi Bi Tan" of the Song Dynasty. It is said that in the early 11th century, after the palaces in Bianjing (now Kaifeng, Henan) were destroyed by fire, Ding Wei was responsible for the reconstruction project. The soil for the construction project originally had to be transported from the suburbs to the construction site by land, which consumed a lot of labor. At this time, Ding Wei came up with a method of digging soil from the street in front of the construction site for use. After a few days, the street was dug into a huge ditch, which was connected to the Bian River. The river water flowed into the ditch, and ships sailed directly from the Bian River to the construction site. Therefore, the building materials transported from all directions no longer had to go through the heavy procedures of unloading at the suburban terminal and then transporting them to the construction site by land. When the project was about to end, the discarded tiles, ashes, and so on were thrown into the giant ditch, and after leveling the soil, it became the street again. Due to the adoption of such planning, the tasks of soil extraction, transportation, waste removal, and street repair were handled in a connected manner, saving a lot of manpower, materials, and financial resources.
    Of course, in the old society, such planning was not for the benefit of the people. Although operations research occurred very early, there was no possibility of it developing into a truly useful science. As Comrade Liu Jiping said in his article: "Only under the socialist system will operations research receive true attention and be widely and effectively used in many national economic sectors."

    朴素的运筹学思想
    棉铃
    目前，有些经济部门正运用一门年轻的科学——运筹学，合理地安排和调度人力、物力。最近，《红旗》第20—21期上刊登了中共山东省委书记刘季平同志的文章，介绍运筹学的内容、作用和推广的经验。文中曾引述了我国古代著名军事家孙膑所提出的赛马策略，说明在当时就有了朴素的运筹学的思想。
    这种思想的苗头，确实是产生得很早，并且也一直在缓慢的发展中。宋朝丁谓处理建造宫室的材料和运输工作的方法，显然是一种线性规划的雏型。这个故事见于宋沈括《梦溪补笔谈》卷二的记载，据说当十一世纪的初年，汴都（今河南开封）的宫室在遭到火灾以后，丁谓负责重建工程。修建工程的泥土，原来要从郊外由旱道运到工地，耗费劳力很大。这时丁谓想出一个办法，就是在工地前面的大街上挖取泥土使用。几天以后，大街被挖成了巨沟，与汴河接通了，河水流入沟中，船只直接由汴河驶到工地，于是从四面八方运来的建筑材料，再也不要经过在郊区码头起卸，然后用陆运搬到工地的一些繁重手续了。在工程将要结束时，又把废弃的瓦砾、灰土等等投入巨沟，平土以后，重新成为大街。由于采用这样的规划，连环地办妥了取土、运输、清除废料和修复街道，节省了很多的人力、物力、财力。
    当然，在旧社会中，这样的打算并不是为了人民的利益着想的。运筹学虽已很早发生，也没有发展成为一门真正有用的科学的可能性。正如刘季平同志在文章中所说的：“只有在社会主义制度下，运筹学才会受到真正的重视，才会在许多国民经济部门中得到广泛的、有成效的运用。”
