Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 29th -- According to recent reports in newspapers here, the Haitian people's anti-dictatorship struggle is rising daily. The U.S.-backed Duvalier tyranny is becoming increasingly unstable. Workers and students are holding anti-government demonstrations in the capital, Port-au-Prince, every day. On the evening of the 27th, demonstrators clashed fiercely with the police because the police opened fire to suppress the demonstrators.

The nationwide student strike has entered its ninth day. The strike was initiated on the 22nd by the Haitian Student Union to demand the release of imprisoned student leaders.

According to reports, organized peasant movements have begun to develop throughout the country. In addition, the workers' movement is also developing, and the automobile drivers' union has announced a strike, which is tending to expand to other departments.

Due to the control and plunder of U.S. imperialism and reactionaries, the living conditions of the Haitian people are extremely harsh. 85% of the country's four million residents are illiterate. The per capita annual income is fifty U.S. dollars. The annual national budget is less than 25 million U.S. dollars, but the value of weapons recently obtained from the United States to maintain reactionary rule has reached 15 million U.S. dollars. Reactionary rule and imperialist plunder have aroused strong dissatisfaction among the people, forcing them to rise up in resistance.

In order to suppress the increasingly rising mass movement, the Haitian government declared martial law last week and closed all universities and colleges.

In the face of the vigorously developing people's movement, the Haitian ruling clique is increasingly disintegrating. Not long ago, in order to alleviate popular discontent, Duvalier replaced three cabinet members and expelled the Catholic Archbishop François Férrière from Haiti. This has deepened the contradiction between the Catholic Church, which has enormous power in the country, and the Duvalier government. While the Church has contradictions with the government authorities, it is also attempting to prevent the people's movement from becoming increasingly revolutionary. The army, which has always been a pillar of the dictatorial regime, was reorganized yesterday, and five senior military officers were dismissed. Some say the army reorganization is "related to the student strike."

Due to the development of the people's anti-dictatorship movement and the increasing instability of the government, the United States has recently stepped up its intervention in Haiti. On the 26th of this month, the Pan American Development Bank—the tool of U.S. imperialism's economic aggression in Latin America—decided to send a "goodwill delegation" to Haiti to "study the financial relations that might be established with Haiti." At the same time, the United States also announced that it would conduct "naval exercises" between Cuba, Haiti, and Jamaica from December 1st to January 1st next year to "show its strength."

### 海地人民反独裁斗争日益高涨  工人学生连日示威并同军警激烈冲突  独裁政权地位不稳正在加紧镇压和排除异己

    海地人民反独裁斗争日益高涨
    工人学生连日示威并同军警激烈冲突
    独裁政权地位不稳正在加紧镇压和排除异己
    新华社哈瓦那29日电　据这里的报纸最近报道，海地人民的反独裁斗争正在日益高涨。美国支持的杜瓦利埃暴政已日益不稳。每天都有工人和学生在首都太子港举行反政府示威游行。27日晚，由于警察开枪镇压示威者，示威者同警察发生了激烈冲突。
    全国范围的学生罢课已进入第九天。这次罢课是在海地学生联合会的倡议下，为要求释放被监禁的学生领导人而在22日开始的。
    据报道，有组织的农民运动已开始在全国得到发展。此外，工人运动也在发展中，汽车司机工会已经宣布了罢工，而且罢工有扩大到其他部门的趋势。
    由于美国帝国主义及反动派的控制和掠夺，海地人民的生活条件极端恶劣。全国四百万居民中有85％是文盲。按人口平均的一年收入为五十美元。每年的国民预算不到二千五百万美元，但是最近为维持反动统治而从美国得到的武器的价值却达到了一千五百万美元。反动统治和帝国主义的掠夺激起了人民的强烈不满，迫使人民起来进行反抗。
    为了镇压日益高涨的群众运动，海地政府已经在上星期宣布实行戒严法，并且关闭了所有的大学和高等学校。
    在蓬勃发展的人民运动面前，海地统治集团日益分崩离析。不久前，为了缓和人民的不满，杜瓦利埃更换了三个内阁阁员，并且把天主教的大主教弗朗索瓦·费里埃逐出海地。这就加深了国内拥有巨大势力的天主教会和杜瓦利埃政府之间的矛盾。教会一方面同政府当局有矛盾，同时又企图阻止人民运动的日趋革命化。一直是独裁政权支柱的军队昨天进行了改组，有五名高级军官被解职。有人说，改组军队“同学生罢课是有联系的”。
    由于人民的反独裁运动的发展和政府的日趋不稳，美国最近加紧了它对海地的干涉。本月26日，美帝国主义在拉丁美洲的经济侵略工具——泛美开发银行——已决定派“亲善代表团”到海地，“研究同海地可能建立的财经关系”。同时，美国还宣布从12月1日至明年1月1日在古巴、海地和牙买加之间的海面进行“海军演习”以“显示它的力量”。（附图片）
