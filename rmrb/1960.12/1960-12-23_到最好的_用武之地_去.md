    Go to the Best "Arena"
    Xiao Bai
    The South China Subtropical Crops Research Institute and the South China Tropical Crops College, which it founded, moved from Guangzhou to Danxian County on Hainan Island, the center of tropical and subtropical crop production, and took root there. After two years of practice, they have been able to use their achievements to illustrate that it is the correct path for some specialized scientific research institutions and universities to be located in production bases.
    Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "Man's knowledge mainly depends on his material production activities, gradually understanding natural phenomena, the nature of nature, the laws of nature, and the relationship between man and nature; and through production activities, he also gradually understands certain mutual relationships between man and man to varying degrees. All this knowledge cannot be obtained without production activities." This passage is especially important for people engaged in scientific research and teaching. In the past, some institutions were located in large cities far from production bases, which undoubtedly had a certain impact on their connection with reality. However, after the researchers of the South China Subtropical Crops Research Institute and the teachers and students of the South China Tropical Crops College moved to the production center that is combined with their major, they gained the benefit of close combination with production practice. For example, when the institute was still in Guangzhou, they could only use the greenhouse as the main experimental site, and the scientific research projects were mostly based on knowledge in literature. Therefore, very few could be applied to production. However, after the institute moved to the countryside, they established experimental bases and demonstration farms, and the researchers directly participated in production labor and directly contacted the tropical plants being studied. They obtained rich knowledge from production practice and mass experience. Their research results can also be immediately tested in production and promoted. The Tropical Crops College, also because it is located in the production center of tropical crops, the teachers and students can not only directly obtain rich practical knowledge of the growth of tropical plants in production practice, but also because they participate in production labor, implement the Party's policy of combining education with production labor, and the learning effect is very good. Establishing scientific research institutions and schools in production bases facilitates on-site research and on-site teaching; this not only overcomes the shortcomings of closed-door research and running schools behind closed doors, but also provides scientific research units and schools with the conditions for continuously improving the level of scientific research and the quality of teaching.
    Establishing scientific research institutions and universities in production bases has so many benefits. In order to improve the level of science and accelerate the training of talents, I hope that all comrades who are already or will be working in production bases will firmly display their skills in this best "arena"!

    到最好的“用武之地”去
    萧柏
    华南亚热带作物科学研究所及其创办的华南热带作物学院，从广州迁到热带和亚热带作物生产中心的海南岛儋县，并在那里扎下根来。经过两年来的实践，它们已经可以用自己所取得的成就，说明有些专业性的科学研究机构和高等学校设在生产基地是一条正确的道路。
    毛泽东同志曾经说过：“人的认识，主要地依赖于物质的生产活动，逐渐地了解自然现象、自然的性质、自然的规律性、人和自然的关系；而且经过生产活动，也在各种不同程度上逐渐地认识了人和人的一定的相互关系。一切这些知识，离开生产活动是不能得到的。”对于搞科学研究和教学工作的人，这段话特别显得重要。过去有些机构设在远离生产基地的大城市里，无疑的，使他们在联系实际上受到一定的影响，而华南亚热带作物科学研究所的研究人员和华南热带作物学院的师生们，在搬到和自己专业相结合的生产中心以后，就获得了密切结合生产实际的好处。比如，过去研究所还在广州时，他们只能把温室当作主要试验场所，科学研究的项目，多半是依赖文献上的知识进行研究。因此，能够在生产上应用的很少。可是，研究所迁到农村以后，他们建立了试验基地和示范农场，研究人员直接参加生产劳动，和研究的热带植物直接接触，他们从生产实践、群众经验中取得了丰富的知识。他们的研究成果又可以立即在生产中受到检验和获得推广。而热带作物学院，也由于处于热带作物的生产中心，师生不但可以在生产实践中直接获得丰富的热带植物生长的实际知识，而且由于参加了生产劳动，贯彻了党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，学习的效果很好。科学研究机关和学校办在生产基地，就便于进行现场研究、现场教学；这不仅克服了闭门研究、关门办学的脱离实际的毛病，同时，使科学研究单位和学校得到了不断提高科学研究水平和教学质量的条件。
    在生产基地建立科学研究机构和高等学校，好处是如此之多。为了提高科学水平，为了加速培养人才，希望一切已经或将要在生产基地工作的同志们，坚定地到这个最好的“用武之地”显示自己的身手吧！
