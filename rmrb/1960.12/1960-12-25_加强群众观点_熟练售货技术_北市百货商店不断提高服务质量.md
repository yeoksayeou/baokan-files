Strengthening the Mass Perspective, Mastering Sales Techniques
Beishi Department Store in Shenyang Continuously Improves Service Quality

(Our report) According to the *Shenyang Daily* news: The leaders of Beishi Department Store in Heping District, Shenyang City, continuously strengthen ideological and political education for employees. On the basis of improving employees' political consciousness, they constantly improve their professional skills and policy understanding. In the context of increasingly busy business and increasing numbers of customers, they always receive customers with enthusiasm and thoughtfulness, and continuously improve the quality of service.

Constantly Improving Ideological Awareness, Continuously Strengthening the Mass Perspective

At the beginning of this year, some cadres and salespersons believed: "The service attitude of Beishi Department Store is among the best in the city, and there is nothing more to improve." The Party General Branch organized employees to discuss the question of "Can the quality of service be further improved?". At the same time, it also organized employees to study the service experience of brother provinces, cities, and brother stores in the city. Through study, debate, and visits, employees realized that improving the quality of service is a long-term, uninterrupted task. On this basis, the "Service Standards" for salespersons were revised. The new standards added new content about being considerate of customers and strengthening product promotion and explanation.

In the work of improving service quality, this store paid special attention to the fluctuating phenomenon of service quality. They adopted the method of "speaking at large meetings, talking at small meetings, checking daily, and promoting daily" to solve this problem. All levels of leadership in the store included improving the service quality of salespersons on the agenda, publicized good deeds and good people, and each product department checked the implementation of service quality every day; and used the radio to summarize the service quality situation of the day. These measures powerfully guaranteed the continuous improvement of service quality.

The Busier the Business, the Better the Attitude

With the continuous improvement of employees' thinking, the Party General Branch further put forward the slogan of "The busier the business, the more energetic we are; the more customers, the better the attitude; we are both salespersons and propagandists," calling on employees to more consciously and actively serve customers. One day, a customer handed over a metal thermos bottle shell. After inspection, salesperson Zheng Zhongwen found that this thermos bottle was a large-mouth, specially made metal shell, and it would take some time to replace the liner. The business was so busy, and there were so many customers, what should be done? Zheng Zhongwen, remembering the Party's call, went to the back room to find an assistant and installed the bottle liner in less than ten minutes.

Improving Professional Skills, Shortening Sales Time

In order to receive customers more quickly and reduce customer waiting time, the store's Party General Branch promptly proposed the new task of improving sales techniques and organized employees to carry out a large-scale technical training activity. In order to improve salespersons' product knowledge, they also carried out activities such as "old leading new, contracted teaching and learning," and organized salespersons to visit and work in wholesale departments and factories to understand the production process and product knowledge, and improve their professional skills. All salespersons diligently studied techniques in order to better serve customers. For example, in order to improve the speed of measuring cloth, salespersons in the fabric group kept their measuring sticks in hand, practicing the wrist strength for measuring, and in more than two months, they increased the average measuring speed from more than one hundred seconds per cloth to about fifty seconds. Through learning from each other's strengths, making up for one's own weaknesses, learning from each other, and improving together, the salespersons' sales technical level was rapidly improved.

Conducting Competitions to Improve Service Quality

An important experience in the continuous improvement of service quality in Beishi Department Store is that they can guide the situation according to the excellent situation of each period, and organize employees to carry out various forms of competitions such as "compare, learn, catch up, and help"; adhere to the evaluation and inspection system of "daily touch, ten-day check, and monthly evaluation," constantly summarize and exchange advanced experience, insert red flags, and establish pacesetters, enriching and improving the content of service quality.

At the beginning of this year, they first established comrades such as Guo Jingyang, Zhang Genhua, and Zheng Zhongwen as service models, and summarized and exchanged their experience, and then created great momentum, compared advanced, learned advanced, and rushed to catch up with advanced. More than ten kinds of competitions were carried out, such as opponent competitions and service technology performance competitions, which mobilized the enthusiasm of the majority of salespersons through various competitions. In this way, advanced promoted backward, and there were no backward around the advanced. For example, in the past, the sundry goods group did not provide enough service to customers. In order to help them improve service quality, the cosmetics group not only took the initiative to deliver experience to their door, but also gave them observation performances, so the service quality of the sundry goods group was quickly improved.

Comprehensively Arranging the Combination of Work, Rest, and Study

Comprehensively and properly arranging employees' work, study, and rest time, so that employees have work and rest, and maintain abundant energy, is another important aspect of doing a good job in service. On the basis of learning from the "four-eight intersection" experience of the industrial sector, Beishi Department Store, according to the business busy and leisure patterns of the store, and on the premise of rationally arranging labor and implementing fixed staffing of counters, implemented a "three-eight intersection" shift system, achieving less on duty during leisure times, more on duty during busy times, and all on duty during very busy times, ensuring employees' sleep, rest, and time for cultural and sports activities. Because these measures were taken, employees were full of energy and full of energy when receiving customers.

    加强群众观点　　熟练售货技术
    北市百货商店不断提高服务质量
    本报讯　据沈阳日报消息：沈阳市和平区北市百货商店领导上不断加强职工思想政治教育，在提高职工政治觉悟的基础上，不断提高业务能力和政策水平，在营业越来越忙、顾客越来越多的情况下，始终热情、周到地接待顾客，并且不断提高服务质量。
    不断提高思想觉悟　不断加强群众观点
    今年年初，有些干部和售货员认为：“北市百货商店服务态度在全市数一数二，没有什么再提高的了。”党总支就组织职工讨论了服务质量能不能再提高”的问题。同时，还组织职工学习了兄弟省市和本市兄弟商店的一些服务经验。通过学习、辩论、参观，职工们都认识到了提高服务质量是一件长期的不应该间断的工作。在此基础上，又修订了售货员“服务标准”。新的标准增添了体贴顾客和加强商品宣传解释的新内容。
    这个商店在提高服务质量工作中，特别注意了服务质量的忽高忽低的现象。他们采取“大会讲，小会说，日日查，天天宣传”的办法，来解决这个问题。商店各级领导部门都把提高售货员的服务质量列入议事日程，宣传好人好事，各商品部每天都检查服务质量执行情况；并利用广播把当天的服务质量情况进行总结。这些措施，有力地保证了服务质量的不断提高。
    营业越忙　态度越好
    职工思想不断提高，党总支又进一步提出了
  “营业越忙，干劲越足，顾客越多，态度越好，既是售货员，又当宣传员”的行动口号，号召职工更加自觉地积极为顾客服务。一天，一位顾客递过一个铁制暖瓶皮来，售货员郑忠文检查后，发现这个暖瓶是一个大口特制的铁皮，换胆需要一定时间，营业又那么忙，顾客又那么多，怎么办？郑忠文想起党的号召后，就到后屋找了一个助手，不到十分钟就把瓶胆装好了。
    提高业务能力　缩短售货时间
    为了更迅速地接待顾客，减少顾客等待时间，商店党总支及时地提出了提高售货技术的新课题，组织职工开展了技术大练兵的活动。为提高售货员的商品知识，他们还开展了“老带新、包教包学”等活动，组织售货员到批发部门和工厂参观、劳动，了解商品的生产过程和商品知识，提高业务能力。全体售货员为了更好地为顾客服务，都勤勤恳恳地学习技术。如布匹组售货员为提高量布速度，尺棍不离手，练习丈量的腕力，两个多月时间就由平均一百多秒钟量一匹布提高到五十秒左右。通过取人之长，补己之短，互相学习，共同提高，售货员的售货技术水平得到了迅速提高。
    开展提高服务质量的竞赛
    北市商店服务质量的不断提高，一条重要的经验，就是他们能根据每个时期的大好形势，因势利导，组织职工开展“比学赶帮”多种形式的竞赛；坚持“日碰、旬查、月评”的评比检查制度，不断总结交流先进经验，插红旗、立标兵，丰富、提高服务质量的内容。
    今年年初，他们首先树立了郭景阳、张根华、郑忠文等同志为服务标兵，并总结交流了他们的经验，进而大造声势，大比先进，大学先进，大赶先进。开展了对手赛、服务技术表演赛等十余种竞赛，通过多种竞赛调动了广大售货员的积极性。这样，就促进了先进帮后进，做到了先进周围无落后。如过去杂品组对顾客服务的不够好，化妆组为了帮助他们提高服务质量，不仅把经验主动地送上门，还给他们作了观摩表演，因而杂品组的服务质量很快提高了。
    全面安排劳逸学习结合
    全面、妥善地安排职工的工作、学习和休息时间，使职工有劳有逸，保持充沛的精力，是做好服务工作的又一个重要方面。北市商店在学习工业部门“四八交叉”经验的基础上，根据商店业务忙闲规律，在合理安排劳动力、实行柜台定员的前提下，推行了“三八交叉”上班制，做到了闲时少上，忙时多上，大忙全上，保证了职工的睡眠、休息和文娱体育活动的时间。由于采取了这些措施，使职工接待起顾客来，精神饱满，干劲十足。
