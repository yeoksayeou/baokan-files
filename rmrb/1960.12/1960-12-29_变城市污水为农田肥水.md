Transforming Urban Sewage into Fertilizer for Farmland

Urban sewage is rich in various fertilizer components needed by crops, and is an inexhaustible source of fertilizer. Urban sewage should be used for agricultural production as quickly and as much as possible.

According to chemical analysis by scientific research departments, urban sewage contains varying degrees of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and other components, all of which are fertilizer needed by crops. Urban sewage is fertilizer water. Using harmless sewage for irrigation accomplishes two things at once, providing both water and fertilizer. According to experiments conducted by the Lishizhai Commune in the suburbs of Fushun, irrigating with sewage without applying ammonium sulfate resulted in more significant yield increases than irrigating with clean water and applying ammonium sulfate. Using sewage for irrigation is also a low-cost, quick-return, and highly profitable method of fertilizing fields, because it can save large quantities of ammonium sulfate and labor for fertilization. This year, the Lishizhai Commune in Fushun irrigated 21,500 mu of rice, vegetables, etc. with urban sewage, saving 923,000 jin of ammonium sulfate and over 34,000 labor days for fertilization. Once the Shenyang-Fushun sewage irrigation canal currently under construction is completed, the annual savings of ammonium sulfate will be roughly equivalent to the total annual output of more than forty synthetic ammonia plants each producing 800 tons, while the investment in building forty 800-ton synthetic ammonia plants is much higher than the investment in building the Shenyang-Fushun sewage irrigation canal. This is not a temporary measure, but a long-term undertaking. It is hoped that Party committees in various regions will give it sufficient attention and vigorously promote this experience.

### 变城市污水为农田肥水

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    变城市污水为农田肥水
    城市污水饱含着农作物需要的各种肥分，是一项取之不尽、用之不竭的肥源。应该把城市污水尽快地和尽可能地用到农业生产上去。
    据科学研究部门化验分析，城市污水含有程度不同的氮、磷、钾等成分，都是农作物需要的肥分。城市污水就是肥水。用无害污水灌田一举两得，既顶水，又顶肥。据抚顺市郊李石寨公社试验，用污水灌田不施硫铵，比用清水灌田加施硫铵增产效果还显著。用污水灌田，还是一项成本低、收效快、收益大的肥田方法，因为用污水灌田可以节省大批硫铵和施肥用工。抚顺李石寨公社今年用城市污水灌溉水稻、蔬菜等两万一千五百亩，节省硫铵九十二万三千斤，节省施肥用工三万四千多个。目前正在修建的沈（阳）抚（顺）污水灌渠完工以后，每年节省的硫铵，大约相当于四十多个年产八百吨合成氨厂一年产量的总和，而修建四十个年产八百吨合成氨厂的投资，却大大高于修建沈抚污水灌渠的投资。这不是一项临时性的措施，而是一项具有长远意义的工作。希望各地党委给予足够的重视，大力推广这项经验。（摘自《辽宁日报》）
