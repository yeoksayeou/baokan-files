Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 14th: The "Voice of the Fighting Pathet Lao" radio station broadcast tonight an appeal from Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, to all the people and troops in Vientiane, calling on the Vientiane troops and people to continue to carry forward the fine tradition of patriotic and heroic struggle, to fight unremittingly, to smash all the enemy's conspiracies, and to resolutely defend the capital Vientiane, the Souvanna Phouma legal government, and the path of peace, neutrality, and national harmony.

The appeal also called on the Lao people to intensify their activities to combat the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum traitorous clique in order to effectively coordinate with the fighting on the Vientiane battlefield.

The appeal said: "After two days of fierce fighting, our troops, together with the people of the capital, have shown a heroic and tenacious spirit, causing damage to the enemy and capturing many prisoners and seizing a batch of weapons. This achievement by the troops and people of the capital demonstrates your firm attitude towards the enemies of the nation and your spirit of not fearing difficulties and sacrifices. The Lao Patriotic Front once again warmly welcomes and praises the unity among all patriotic, peace-loving strata, troops, and people."

The appeal said: "However, we are all clearly aware that this is only the beginning. Although American imperialism, the Thai reactionaries, and the Boun Oum-Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique have suffered losses, they will still use all means and methods to continue to realize their conspiracy to capture the capital Vientiane, overthrow the legitimate government of Prince Souvanna Phouma, and establish a puppet government as their loyal tool."

The appeal pointed out: "Through the above issues, we can clearly see that the enemy's plan to attack the capital Vientiane and the activities to establish a puppet government in Savannakhet are closely coordinated. Therefore, in order to defend our beloved capital, comrades must overcome all kinds of difficulties and hardships."

The appeal said: "We know that our basic strength is unity and struggle, is the spirit of patriotic and heroic struggle against the enemy. Our successive victories are precisely due to the above precious factors. This is also the factor that determines our victory."

Prince Souphanouvong said at the end of the appeal: "I sincerely extend my greetings to the wounded brothers, and I express my concern for the lives of all the people in the capital. I wish you success in your unity and heroic struggle."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 15th: The "Voice of the Fighting Pathet Lao" radio station today broadcast a statement issued by Captain Kong Le, Commander of the Vientiane Garrison and Chairman of the Coup Committee. The statement strongly condemned the open aggression against Laos by American imperialism and its servants Thailand, South Vietnam, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and called on all Lao troops and people to strengthen unity and struggle to drive the enemy out of the capital Vientiane.

The statement also called on all peace-loving countries in the world to help the legitimate government of Prince Souvanna Phouma and the Lao people to stop the aggression against Laos by American imperialism, Thailand, and other running dogs of American imperialism.

The statement said, "The troops of the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum traitorous clique, under the command of American officers, including some officers from South Vietnam and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, as well as some Thai troops, crossed the river from Thailand to attack Vientiane at noon on December 13. When the government troops counterattacked the troops of the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum traitorous clique through the urban area of Vientiane, the embassies of the United States, Thailand, and South Vietnam fired at the government troops, attempting to prevent the government troops from advancing to strike the enemy. In addition, there is news that American imperialism and the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum traitorous clique are preparing to send planes to bomb the people and troops of Vientiane."

The statement said, "In the face of the above serious situation, I, in the name of Commander of the Vientiane Garrison, Chairman of the Coup Committee, and Vice-Chairman of the 'Committee for Peace, Neutrality, National Harmony, and National Unification,' issue a statement strongly opposing the aggression against Laos by American imperialism, Thailand, South Vietnam, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique; strongly opposing and warning the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum traitorous clique, who are harming the country and the people, for introducing foreign troops to invade Laos, attack Vientiane, and expand the civil war in which the Lao people kill each other, and at the same time using military pressure to coerce the King and members of the National Assembly to oppose the legitimate government of Prince Souvanna Phouma."

In the statement, Captain Kong Le demanded that American imperialism, Thailand, and other reactionaries immediately stop interfering in Laos; demanded that the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum traitorous clique immediately withdraw their troops and immediately stop all actions against the government in order to facilitate the realization of peace and national harmony in Laos.

The statement emphasized: "If American imperialism and the traitorous clique continue to attack Vientiane or send planes to kill the Lao people, then the troops and the people, united as one, are determined to fight to the last drop of blood. When necessary, we will request military assistance from all peace-loving countries."

The statement continued: "Since the rebel army attacked Vientiane, our army has carried out heroic battles, captured more than one hundred rebels, seized a large number of weapons, and initially repelled the enemy's attack. Here, I would like to express my welcome to the government army, the Pathet Lao fighting forces, the police, and the armed youth, and praise their patriotic and heroic spirit. I would like to express my welcome to the patriotic spirit of the people who have helped the government army to fight against the national enemy."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 15th: According to the "Voice of the Fighting Pathet Lao" radio station today, Kou Voravong, the Minister of Information of the Kingdom of Laos, issued a statement reaffirming that the Phouma government is the only legitimate government of Laos.

The statement sternly condemned the Boun Oum-Phoumi Nosavan clique's establishment of a puppet government in Savannakhet and its attack on the capital Vientiane as a new step in American imperialism's conspiracy to restore the position and influence of its reactionary running dogs in Laos. The statement said: "Regarding the illegal and unjust actions of American imperialism and the Boun Oum-Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique, I believe I have a responsibility to issue the following statement on behalf of the legitimate government of Prince Souvanna Phouma: The government of Prince Souvanna Phouma is the only legitimate government of the Kingdom of Laos, and it still exists and continues to perform the task of administering the country."

The statement pointed out that, as is well known, the Souvanna Phouma government is the only legitimate government of the Kingdom of Laos, established in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, and has been trusted by the National Assembly and approved by the King. "This government still exists in the eyes of the law and the people."

The statement continued: "Everyone knows that the Boun Oum-Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique is the chief culprit in the conspiracy to establish a fake government. They deliberately betrayed the motherland, opposed the King and the Constitution, especially Phoumi Nosavan and some of his cronies, who have been formally ordered by the King to be dismissed from the government and political institutions."

The statement emphasized: "When some members of parliament hold meetings in Savannakhet under the support of the Boun Oum-Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique, when their basic freedom rights are deprived, they cannot truly represent the wishes of the people, and therefore their resolutions are invalid. When the King is surrounded by the traitorous clique, the King's orders are also invalid, just as Prince Souvanna Phouma once announced after the traitorous clique created riots in Luang Prabang."

The statement expressed firm condemnation of American imperialism and the traitorous clique for coercing the King and some members of parliament by despotic means to establish a puppet reactionary government in order to realize the American conspiracy to interfere in and invade Laos.

The statement said: "In order to defend the independence and sovereignty of Laos, and to defend the path of peace, neutrality, and national harmony, I, in the name of the government of Prince Souvanna Phouma, call on the people of the whole country to actively support and assist the legitimate government of Laos, and resolutely oppose and overthrow the puppet government of the running dogs of American imperialism.

The statement also said: "I would like to call on all countries that have diplomatically recognized the legitimate government of Laos and all peace-loving and just people around the world to support the legitimate government of Laos and condemn all conspiracies of American imperialism to interfere and establish a puppet dictatorial government in Laos."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 15th: Vietnam News Agency reported today that the Royal Lao Government forces and the Pathet Lao fighting forces, under the command of Captain Kong Le, repelled twelve boats used by the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak traitorous clique for offensive purposes on the Mekong River on the 14th and sank another boat.

As of 2:00 PM on the 14th, Captain Kong Le's troops controlled the capital Vientiane. They stubbornly and continuously fought resolutely with the troops of the traitorous clique, who were commanded by American officers and supported by American imperialists and Thai reactionaries. The troops of the traitorous clique continued to cross the Mekong River from Beishan and from the Thai side to attack the Royal Government forces and the Pathet Lao fighting forces.

On the orders of the United States, the Thai reactionaries not only provided personnel and weapons to the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique, but also continued to directly bombard Vientiane with mortars from Thai territory across the Mekong River.

It is worth noting that senior Thai military officers and American advisors are directly commanding the troops of the traitorous clique stationed in Thailand.

Vietnam News Agency said that foreign news also revealed that the South Vietnamese authorities also ordered their troops stationed in the second and third military regions (in central Vietnam and the central highlands of South Vietnam) to support the traitors in Laos. The South Vietnamese authorities also sent representatives to Bangkok to meet with the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization headquarters.

According to foreign news, the troops of the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique, supported by the United States and Thailand, have suffered heavy losses under the fierce attacks of the government forces and the Pathet Lao fighting forces commanded by Captain Kong Le.

    老挝人民坚决抗击美国侵略和叛军进攻
    苏发努冯和贡勒大尉号召军民加紧团结斗争保卫万象
    奔舍那发表声明重申富马政府是老挝唯一合法的政府
    新华社河内14日电　寮国战斗部队电台今晚广播了老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王给万象全体人民和部队的号召书，呼吁万象部队和人民继续发扬爱国主义英勇斗争的良好传统，不懈地斗争，粉碎敌人的一切阴谋，坚决保卫首都万象，保卫梭发那·富马合法政府和和平中立、民族和睦路线。
    号召书同时还呼吁老挝全国人民加紧活动，打击文翁—富米叛国集团，以便有效地配合万象战场的战斗。
    号召书说：“经过两天的激烈战斗，我们的部队和首都人民一起，表现了英勇顽强的精神，使敌人受到损害，抓了许多俘虏和缴获了一批武器。首都的部队和人民所取得的这个成绩，显示了你们对民族敌人的坚决态度和不怕困难牺牲的精神。老挝爱国战线党对所有爱国、爱和平的各阶层、各部队和人民之间的团结一致，再一次表示热烈的欢迎和赞扬。”
    号召书说：“但是，我们都清楚地知道，这只不过是开始。美帝国主义、泰国反动派和文翁—富米叛国集团虽然遭到损失，但是他们仍然会使用一切手段和方法，来继续实现攻占首都万象、推翻梭发那·富马亲王的合法政府和建立一个作为它们忠实工具的傀儡政府的阴谋。”
    号召书指出：“通过上述问题，我们清楚地看到：敌人进攻首都万象的计划和在沙湾拿吉建立傀儡政府的活动是密切配合的。因此，为了保卫我们可爱的首都，同胞们还要克服种种艰难困苦。”
    号召书说：“我们知道，我们的基本力量是团结斗争，是反对敌人的爱国主义英勇斗争精神。我们接连取得的胜利，正是由于上述可贵的因素。这也是决定我们胜利的因素。”
    苏发努冯亲王在号召书的最后说：“我衷心地问候受伤的兄弟们，并对首都全体人民的生活寄予关怀，祝你们的团结和英勇的斗争取得胜利。”
    新华社河内15日电　寮国战斗部队电台今天广播了万象卫戍部队司令、政变委员会主席贡勒大尉发表的声明。声明强烈谴责美帝国主义及其仆从泰国、南越和蒋介石集团对老挝的公开侵略，并且号召老挝所有的部队和全体人民加强团结和斗争，把敌人赶出首都万象。
    声明还呼吁全世界一切爱好和平的国家帮助梭发那·富马亲王的合法政府和老挝人民，制止美帝国主义、泰国和美帝国主义的其它走狗对老挝的侵略。
    声明说，“在美国军官指挥下的富米—文翁叛国集团的军队，其中有一部分南越和蒋介石集团的军官以及一部分泰国军队，已于12月13日中午从泰国渡河进攻万象。当政府军通过万象市区反击富米—文翁叛国集团军队的时候，美国、泰国和南越等大使馆却向政府军射击，企图阻止政府军前进打击敌人。此外，还有消息说，美帝国主义和富米—文翁叛国集团正在准备派飞机轰炸万象人民和部队。”
    声明说，“面对上述严重局势，我谨以万象卫戍司令、政变委员会主席、‘争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会’副主席的名义发表声明，强烈反对美帝国主义、泰国、南越和蒋介石集团对老挝的侵略；强烈反对和警告卖国殃民的富米—文翁叛国集团引进外国军队侵略老挝，进攻万象，扩大老挝人民自相残杀的内战，同时以军事压力要挟国王和国民议会议员反对梭发那·富马亲王合法政府的行为。”
    贡勒大尉在声明中要求美帝国主义、泰国和其他国家的反动派立即停止干涉老挝；要求富米—文翁叛国集团立即撤退军队，立即停止一切反对政府的行动，以利老挝实现和平和民族和睦。
    声明强调说：“如果美帝国主义和叛国集团仍然继续进攻万象或派飞机杀害老挝人民，那么，部队和人民团结在一起，决心战到流尽最后一滴血。必要的时候，我们将向爱好和平的各国要求军事援助。”
    声明接着说：“自从叛军进攻万象以来，我军进行了英勇的战斗，俘虏了一百多名叛军，缴获了大批武器，并初步打退了敌人的进攻。在此，我谨向政府军队、寮国战斗部队、警察和武装的青年等兄弟们，表示欢迎，并赞扬他们这种爱国的、英勇的精神。我谨向曾经帮助政府军队打击民族敌人的人民的爱国精神表示欢迎。”
    新华社河内15日电　据寮国战斗部队电台今天广播：老挝王国政府宣传大臣贵宁·奔舍那发表声明，重申富马政府是老挝唯一的合法政府。
    声明严厉谴责文翁—富米集团在沙湾拿吉成立傀儡政府和对首都万象的进攻，是美帝国主义妄图恢复它的反动走狗在老挝的地位和势力的阴谋中的一个新的步骤。声明说：“对于美帝国主义和文翁—富米叛国集团的非法和非正义行动，我认为我有责任代表梭发那·富马亲王的合法政府发表如下声明：梭发那·富马亲王政府是老挝王国唯一的合法政府，它仍然存在和照常执行管理国家的任务。”
    声明指出，众所周知，梭发那·富马政府是老挝王国的唯一合法政府，是按照宪法的规定成立、并得到国民议会的信任和国王批准的政府。对法律和人民来说，这个政府仍然存在。”
    声明继续说：“大家都知道，文翁—富米叛国集团是阴谋成立冒牌政府的主犯，他们蓄意背叛祖国，反对国王和宪法，特别是富米·诺萨万及其一部分爪牙，曾经由国王正式下令从政府和政权机构中开除。”
    声明强调说：“当一部分议员在文翁—富米叛国集团的扶持下在沙湾拿吉举行会议、他们的起码的自由权利被剥夺了的时候，不能真正地代表人民的愿望，因此他们所作出的决议是无效的。当国王被叛国集团包围的时候，国王的命令也是无效的。正如叛国集团在琅勃拉邦制造暴乱后，梭发那·富马亲王所曾经宣布的那样。”
    声明表示坚决控告美帝国主义和叛国集团用专横的手段要挟国王和一部分议员成立傀儡反动政府，以实现美国干涉和侵略老挝的阴谋。
    声明说：“为了保卫老挝的独立主权，保卫和平中立、民族和睦路线，我谨以梭发那·富马亲王政府的名义，呼吁全国人民积极支持和协助老挝合法政府，坚决反对和推翻美帝国主义走狗的傀儡政府。
    声明还说：“我谨呼吁在外交上已经承认老挝合法政府的各国和全世界爱好和平和正义的人民支持老挝合法政府，谴责美帝国主义的干涉和在老挝建立傀儡独裁政府的一切阴谋。”
    新华社河内15日电　越南通讯社今天报道：据外国消息报道，老挝王国政府军和寮国战斗部队在贡勒大尉指挥下，14日在湄公河上击退了富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞叛国集团用来进行进攻的十二条船并击沉另一条船。
    截至14日下午二时为止，贡勒大尉的部队控制着首都万象。他们顽强地不断同由美国军官指挥、得到美帝国主义者和泰国反动派支持的叛国集团的部队进行坚决的斗争。叛国集团的部队仍然继续从北汕和从泰国方面越过湄公河前去进攻王国政府军和寮国战斗部队。
    泰国反动派奉美国之命，不仅向富米·诺萨万叛国集团提供人员和武器，而且还从湄公河彼岸泰国领土上继续直接用迫击炮轰击万象。
    值得注意的是，泰国高级军官和美国顾问正在直接指挥驻在泰国的叛国集团的部队。
    越南通讯社说，外国消息还透露，南越当局也命令它驻在第二和第三军区（在越南中部和越南中南部高原）的部队支援老挝的叛国分子。南越当局还派遣代表到曼谷去同东南亚条约组织集团司令部会晤。
    据外国消息透露，美国和泰国支持的富米·诺萨万叛国集团的部队，受到贡勒大尉指挥的政府军和寮国战斗部队的猛烈打击，遭受了沉重的损失。
