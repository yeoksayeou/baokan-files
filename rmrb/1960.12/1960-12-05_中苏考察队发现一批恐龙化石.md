	The second year (1960) of fieldwork by the Sino-Soviet Central Asia Paleontological Expedition, jointly formed by the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Paleontological Institute of the Soviet Union, has concluded. This year, Sino-Soviet scientists conducted surveys and excavations of fossil sites in the western part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Gansu, and eastern Qinghai, discovering and investigating more than thirty fossil sites and collecting over one hundred and several dozen boxes of Cretaceous (approximately 100 million years ago) dinosaur and Cenozoic (from the present back to 70 million years ago) mammal fossil specimens. Among the dinosaur fossils discovered in the Maoertu area, northeast of the Alxa Desert in Inner Mongolia, are more than ten complete and partially complete skeletons, mainly primitive hadrosaur-type ornithopod dinosaurs, as well as large carnivorous, sauropod, and ankylosaur dinosaurs (commonly known as "walking tanks"). Among the two ankylosaur dinosaur fossils, one may be the largest and most complete ankylosaur fossil discovered in the world to date. The expedition also found a large number of Paleolithic artifacts in the lower part of the loess of Lingshui Cave in Ningxia, which are production tools made and used by primitive humans during the Middle or earlier Paleolithic period.

    中苏考察队发现一批恐龙化石
    由中国科学院古脊椎动物与古人类研究所和苏联古生物研究所合作组成的中苏中亚细亚古生物考察队第二年度（1960）的野外工作已经结束。今年中苏科学工作者在内蒙古自治区西部、宁夏回族自治区、甘肃和青海东部进行了古脊椎动物化石地点的调查发掘工作，发现和调查了三十多处化石地点，采集了一百数十箱白垩纪（约一亿年前）恐龙和新生代（从现在上溯到七千万年前）哺乳动物化石标本。在内蒙古阿拉善大沙漠东北部毛儿图地区发现的恐龙化石中有十多个完整的和部分完整的骨架，主要是原始的鸭咀龙式的鸟脚类恐龙，另外也有庞大的食肉类、蜥脚类和甲龙类恐龙（俗称“爬行的坦克”）。在两架甲龙类恐龙化石中，有一架可能是目前世界上已发现的最大、最完整的甲龙化石。考察队还在宁夏灵水洞黄土的下部找到了大量旧石器，它们是旧石器时代中期或更早的原始人类制作和使用过的生产工具。
