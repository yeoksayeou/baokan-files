　　In the late autumn of 1957, at the National Agricultural Exhibition Hall in Beijing, an old farmer with silver whiskers and white hair stood in front of a specimen of "Big Head Lian" wheat, its grains plump and round like pomegranate seeds, gazing at it in a trance, unwilling to leave for a long time. The guide noticed that this old man looked a bit familiar. After thinking for a moment, oh! It turned out that this old visitor had already stood in front of this exhibit several times, spacing out. The guide thought for a moment, took out two wheat seeds from a glass bottle, handed them to the old man and said:

　　"Old man, I'll give you these two wheat seeds, take them back and plant them! Where are you from?"

　　The old man was so happy that he didn't know what to say. He quickly wrapped the wheat seeds in paper, and then smiled and replied: "I come from far away, my home is in Wudu, Gansu."

　　This old man is the farmer scientist Zhang Shiqing, a well-known figure in the Wudu area. Since liberation, for ten years, he has persisted in experiments, using hybridization methods to cultivate many new varieties. He has successfully tested rice and "five-crop fields" in high-altitude cold regions using improved varieties, intercropping, and various other comprehensive measures, and has been praised by the local farmers.

　　Cultivating New Varieties

　　Zhang Shiqing is already in his fifties this year. In the old society, his family of six had only 1.4 mu of land, living in hunger and cold all year round. From an early age, he had a heart that loved the mountains and loved agriculture, determined to change the face of the mountainous areas. But in the old society, this wish could not be realized. After liberation, he was allocated land. At that time, industrial construction in the cities was booming. A friend knew that he had studied in a private school for four years and could read, so he wanted to find him a job in the city. But Zhang Shiqing had his own ideals. He said: "Agriculture is the foundation! If everyone dislikes the hardship of doing agriculture and runs outside, who will build the countryside?" He steadfastly took root in the countryside.

　　One day, he saw in a book called "Agricultural Technology": "To increase yield per unit area, seeds are very important, and the best way to cultivate good varieties suitable for the local area is hybridization..." He said to himself: "That's right! What Bima No. 1! Golden Queen! They were all varieties that didn't exist in the world before, weren't they cultivated by people? But I still think Bima No. 1's grains are a bit small. If I could cultivate wheat grains as big as corn kernels, how much more grain would be produced! I must cultivate several new varieties for future generations!" From then on, every day after returning from the fields, he couldn't bother to drink water or rest. As soon as he turned around, he would go to the backyard. Sometimes, when he had an idea at night, he would get out of bed and conduct experiments with a lantern. Soon, his backyard became an agricultural experimental field, planted with various wheat, corn, potatoes, melons, fruits... In order to cultivate new varieties, he was like a hardworking bee. Wherever there were flowers, there was his presence. Once, he took a train from Lanzhou back to Wudu. When the train was about to arrive at Sanyangchuan Station, he saw a new variety in the field from the train and eagerly wanted to take some back for trial planting. As soon as the train stopped, he went down to collect it, but when he returned to the station, the train had already left.

　　This old man used his labor and took advantage of all opportunities such as visits, meetings, and interviews to collect and cultivate many new varieties. He has already used grafting, hybridization and other methods to cultivate three new varieties of wheat and corn, 52 new fruit trees, and is still studying grafting wheat with alfalfa and grafting domestic cotton with wild cotton. He wants to make wheat and cotton become perennial plants in the future, so that they can be planted once and harvested every year like fruit trees. Some people may say that wanting cotton to become like peach trees is as illusory as trying to pick stars from the sky. However, the farmers in the mountainous area of Wudu, weren't they also ridiculed for wanting to plant rice as wanting to pick stars from the sky? But the fantasy finally became reality.

　　Rice Goes Up the Mountain

　　In the spring of 1956, Zhang Shiqing joined the Communist Party of China in the upsurge of cooperativization, and he was filled with even more enthusiasm. From this time on, he kept thinking in his heart: I swore before the Party to fight for communism to the end, so how can I lead the masses to build the mountainous areas into a beautiful society? He set his efforts in the direction of: let the mountainous areas plant rice and turn his hometown into Jiangnan! He began experimental research on rice going up the mountain. Wudu Longxing is a place with high mountains and cold water, and rice has never grown well there! So some people said that Zhang Shiqing was daydreaming. Zhang Shiqing had his own views. He believed that the problem was not the cold water, but whether the rice could avoid the early frost when it matured? He was determined to explore in practice. In the first year, he planted rice seedlings from the plains, but only half of the ears emerged before they encountered early frost and died. The second year, he planted the seedlings earlier, but they were still killed by early frost. The third year, he used rice seedlings from the shallow mountains for experiments, but they encountered early frost again during flowering and did not bear seeds. However, Zhang Shiqing saw the factors of success from the failures: although the experiment was not successful, wasn't the effect better year by year? Early rice cultivation, afraid of late frost; late rice planting, afraid of early frost. Frost became the great enemy of rice going up the mountain!

　　How to conquer frost? Zhang Shiqing pondered this matter day and night. One day, he ran to the cornfield and saw that the corn planted using the warm water germination method matured earlier than ordinary corn. He jumped up happily and said to himself: "This is the way!" So he based on the principle of the germination method, let the rice seeds germinate indoors, and then sow them for seedling cultivation, covering them with straw curtains in the morning and evening. In this way, the seedlings escaped the late frost and were planted earlier. This year, for the first time, rice was successfully tested in the high-altitude cold mountainous area.

　　Climbing Peaks

　　Zhang Shiqing's hometown is surrounded by mountains and overlapping peaks. Zhang Shiqing has been accustomed to crossing mountains since he was a child. Now, he is working hard to climb another kind of peak—the peak of science and technology. The Party calls for increasing the yield per unit area of crops to support national industrial construction. He thought: It is not enough to have good varieties suitable for mountainous areas. If we change from harvesting one crop a year to harvesting two crops a year, wouldn't one mu of land become two mu of land? He began experiments on replanting in mountainous areas again. After harvesting wheat on his six-fen plot, he planted corn. As soon as this spread, it became news in this small mountain village again. Villagers discussed one after another: "Planting corn on idle land, it won't ripen even if it's late. If planting corn in wheat stubble can ripen, then flowers will bloom on the stones!" Zhang Shiqing said: "This six-fen plot is for experimentation. If it doesn't work, it's all for growing grass for livestock. We'll do it again next year!" Sure enough, the corn did not bear seeds that year and was frozen to death by an early frost.

　　Zhang Shiqing was not shaken at all. He analyzed that the reason for the failure was: the planting was too late. So the second year, as soon as the wheat was harvested, he planted corn. However, only 10% matured in the autumn, and the remaining 90% were frozen to death before the grains were round. He felt happy in his heart that there was progress this year and decided to continue the experiment. His close friend Tan Zhisheng persuaded him: "Old brother! Our place is high and cold, I think we should just forget it!" Zhang Shiqing firmly said: "Although the experiments in the past two years have failed, they have helped me figure out the temper of corn. Besides, failure is the mother of success. Research experiments are about overcoming difficulties in order to achieve victory." Zhang Shiqing, like the Foolish Old Man who moved mountains, removed obstacles on the way to the peak of science one by one, fighting in the mountainous area day and night. He carefully analyzed the climate changes in the mountainous area, pondered the temper of corn, analyzed the reasons for failure, and calculated that corn needed 150 days to mature. If it could be planted ten days earlier, it could avoid early frost. Then, he deduced from these 150 days that corn should be planted four or five days before "Mangzhong" (Grain in Ear), but wheat would not be harvested until four or five days after "Mangzhong". If this contradiction could be solved, then two crops a year could be achieved.

　　At this time, the secretary of the prefectural party committee came to inspect the work and encouraged Zhang Shiqing, saying: "Don't be intimidated by difficulties, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome in front of Communists." The Party's teachings echoed in his ears, further increasing his confidence. He concentrated on thinking about the problem of two crops a year. He thought about it while eating and while sleeping. One day, after dinner, he was lying on the kang thinking and counting on his fingers. He turned his head and saw his wife washing bean sprouts on the stove. At this moment, he suddenly thought: Bean sprouts can grow in the house. If corn is also germinated with water and then planted, wouldn't it be equivalent to planting seven or eight days earlier? Thinking of this, he excitedly patted the kang mat and said: "Ha! There is hope this year!"

　　Zhang Shiqing used the warm water germination method to cleverly avoid early frost for the corn, and all of it bore seeds, yielding 530 jin per mu. At this time, people were vying to see the two-crop corn experimented by Zhang Shiqing, and praised his noble style of daring to think and dare to do. Zhang Shiqing believed that this was just the beginning. He thought: Since two crops can be grown in a year, can three crops, four crops, or even five crops be grown? So, on the basis of two crops a year, he proposed three crops a year: intercropping corn in wheat fields, and intercropping vegetables between corn rows after the wheat is harvested, so that the land can be used all year round. When he put forward this plan at the agricultural cooperative committee meeting at that time, most of the cadres strongly supported him, but only the Supervisory Committee Director He Zunzhou shook his head like a peddler's rattle. After the meeting, Zhang Shiqing personally soaked 30 jin of seeds and carried them to the field to prepare for intercropping. Who knew that He Zunzhou blocked him at the edge of the field. He said: "No! Quickly turn the soaked seeds into bran for the livestock!" Zhang Shiqing said: "It can be done! The cooperative committee has approved it, so we must act according to the regulations!" He Zunzhou insisted: "If you insist on planting, you, the research group leader, will take responsibility for the output. If the output is reduced, you will be responsible!" Zhang Shiqing remembered the words of the secretary of the prefectural party committee, and he patted his chest and said: "I'll take responsibility, 500 jin per mu, I'll pay one jin for every jin reduced!" In this way, Zhang Shiqing led the members of the cooperative to intercrop and interplant eight mu of land according to the plan. After everyone's careful cultivation, all three crops achieved a bumper harvest, with each mu yielding 440 jin of wheat, 776 jin of corn, and 1,500 jin of cabbage.

　　On the basis of the victory of three crops a year, Zhang Shiqing did not stagnate. After carefully calculating the frost-free period and crop growth period in the mountainous area, he also studied the natural conditions such as land, temperature, and sunlight when planting winter wheat last year. He planted winter spinach in the winter wheat field (four rows of wheat, two feet wide, with two feet of spinach sprinkled in the middle). In the spring of the second year, after the spinach was harvested, he planted corn on the land where the spinach was planted. Soon after the corn emerged, the wheat matured and was harvested. After harvesting the wheat, he planted foreign soybeans with a growing period of about 100 days. At the same time, he also sprinkled carrots between the corn plants. As a result of this intercropping and interplanting, this year, the eight mu of land yielded an average of 747 jin of wheat, 350 jin of foreign soybeans, 300 jin of corn, 1,500 jin of spinach, and 200 jin of carrots per mu, totaling 1,397 jin of grain and 1,700 jin of vegetables, which is several times higher than the local general field yield. Because it is intercropping and interplanting of five crops, people call this farming method "five-crop chain". The scientific leadership department of Gansu Province believes that this method of fully utilizing land resources, rationally rotating crops, and intercropping tall and short stalk crops not only fully conforms to the principles of plant population physiology, but also conforms to the principles of operations research in crop configuration, relatively saving labor. Therefore, in July this year, Wudu County held an on-site meeting in Longxing Commune, deciding to promote the advanced farming experience of "five-crop chain" on 50,000 mu of land during the autumn sowing of winter wheat this year.

　　Glory is Attributed to the Party

　　Zhang Shiqing has climbed one peak after another in agricultural science, achieving one achievement after another. The Party has also continuously given him encouragement. He has attended 13 national, provincial, prefectural, and county-level representative meetings of advanced producers, received awards eight times, and also met the great leader Chairman Mao in Beijing, and was hired as a special researcher at the Gansu Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences. In July this year, he also went to the Soviet Union to visit and study for more than 20 days, greatly broadening his horizons and further increasing his creative wisdom. Zhang Shiqing attributes all his achievements to the Party. When he harvested the big and sweet peaches that he carefully cultivated this autumn, he first picked the biggest and sweetest peach and wanted to send it to Beijing to dedicate it to the respected leader Chairman Mao, and wrote a poem:

　　Thousands of peaches in the peach orchard,
　　Red and sweet, better than flat peaches;
　　Dedicated to the leader Chairman Mao,
　　Wishing him happiness and longevity as high as the sky.

    农业科学战线上的“愚公”
    ——记甘肃省武都县农民科学家张世清
　　本报记者　黄之浜
    1957年深秋，在北京全国农业展览馆里，一位银须白发的老农，站在颗粒又胖又圆、如同石榴籽一样的“大头连”小麦标本面前，出神地望着，久久不肯离去。解说员发觉这个老头有点面熟，想了一下，哦！原来这位老观众已经几次站在这种展品面前发“呆”了。解说员想了想，从玻璃瓶里拿出两颗麦种，递到老头面前说：
    “老人家，这两颗麦子送给你，拿回去种吧！你是哪儿的人呢？”
    老头高兴得不知说什么好，连忙用纸包好麦子，才笑眯眯地回答：“远道来的，俺家是甘肃武都。”
    这个老头就是农民科学家张世清，在武都一带是个鼎鼎有名的人物。他从解放到现在，十年来一直坚持试验，用杂交的方法培育出许多新品种，用改良品种、间种、复种等各种综合性措施，在高寒山区试种成功水稻和“五熟田”，受到当地农民群众的赞扬。
    培育新品种
    张世清今年已经五十几岁了。在旧社会里，全家六口人，只有一亩四分地，终年过着饥寒交迫的生活。他从小就有一颗热爱山区、热爱农业的心，决心要改变山区面貌。但是在旧社会这个愿望却无法实现。解放以后，他分到土地。当时，城里的工业建设闹得火红，有个朋友知道他过去念过四年私塾，认识字，要给他在城里找个工作。谁知张世清却有他自己的理想。他说：“农业是根基啊！要是人人都嫌干农业艰苦，往外面跑，那农村由谁来建设呢？”他坚定不移地在农村扎下根。
    有一天，他从一本《农业技术》书上看到：“要提高单位面积产量，种子很重要，而培育本地方适用的良种，最好的办法是杂交……”。他自言自语说：“对！什么碧玛一号！金皇后！它先都是世上没有的品种，还不是人培育出来的，不过我还嫌碧玛一号的颗儿有点小，要能把小麦颗儿培育成玉米颗儿大，那该增产多少粮食呢！我一定要给后辈人培育出几种新品种！”从此，他每天从地里回来，顾不上喝水，顾不上休息，一转身就钻到后院去了，有时晚上想出门道，便从床上爬起来，打着灯笼去进行试验。不久，他家的后院便成了一座农业试验场，里面种着各种小麦、玉米、洋芋、瓜果……。为了培育新品种，他像一只辛勤的蜜蜂一样，有花的地方就有他的踪影。有一次，他从兰州乘火车回武都，火车快到三羊川车站时，他从车上看见地里有一种新品种，急想拿点回去试种，车刚停下，他便下去采集，但回到车站时，火车早已开走了。
    这位老人就是这样以自己的劳动，并利用参观、开会、访问等一切机会，搜集、培育了许多新品种。他已经用嫁接杂交等办法培育出小麦、玉米新品种三种，新果树五十二种，还在研究用苜蓿嫁接小麦、用野棉花嫁接家棉花。他要使小麦和棉花将来都变成多年生植物，种一次便可以像果树似的，年年采摘果实。也许有人会说，要棉花变成桃树那样，其渺茫和虚幻，就好比伸手想摘天上星。但是，武都山区的农民，从前想栽水稻，不是也曾经被人讥笑为想摘天上星么？然而幻想终于变成了现实。
    水稻上山
    1956年春天，张世清在合作化高潮中加入了中国共产党，他浑身更充满了干劲。从这时起，他心里就一直盘算着：我在党的面前宣誓要为共产主义奋斗到底，那么怎样领导群众把山区建设成美好的社会呢？他给自己定了努力方向：让山区种上水稻，把家乡变成江南！他开始了水稻上山的试验研究。武都隆兴这个地方山高水凉，自古种稻子就不长！所以有些人就说张世清是在胡思乱想。张世清却有自己的见解。他认为问题不在水凉，就看水稻成熟时能不能躲过早霜？他决心在实践中摸索。头一年，他把平川地方的稻秧插上，只抽了一半穗，就遇到早霜，冻死了。第二年提早插秧，结果还是叫早霜冻死了。第三年用浅山地方的稻秧作试验，扬花时又遇到早霜，没有结上籽。但是张世清却从失败中看到成功的因素：试验虽然没有成功，效果不是一年比一年好么？早育秧，怕晚霜；迟插秧，又怕早霜。霜，成了水稻上山的大敌！
    怎样征服霜呢？张世清日夜为这事琢磨着。有一天，他跑到玉米地里，看到用温水催芽法种的玉米比一般玉米提前成熟了，他高兴得跳了起来，自言自语地说：“这可有了办法了！”于是他就根据催芽法的原理，让稻籽在屋里发芽，然后下种育苗，早晚用草帘盖住。这样，秧苗逃过晚霜关，又提前插了秧。这一年，开天辟地第一次在高寒的山区试种成功了水稻。
    攀登高峰
    张世清的家乡，群山环抱，峰岳重叠。张世清从小就习惯于翻山越岭，现在，他又在努力攀登另外一种高峰——科学技术的高峰。党号召提高农作物的单位面积产量，支援国家工业建设。他想：光有适合山区的好品种还不够，如果把一年收一季，改成一年收两季，一亩地不就可以变成两亩地么？他又开始了山区复种的试验。他在自己的六分地上收割小麦后，就点上玉米。这事一传开去，又成了这个小山村里的新闻。乡亲们纷纷议论说：“闲地点玉米，迟一点都不得熟，麦茬地里点玉米要能熟，石头上都会开出花来！”张世清说：“这六分地是作试验的，不成了，全当给牲口种草，明年再来！”果然，这一年玉米没有结上籽，就被一场早霜冻死了。
    张世清一点没有动摇。他分析了失败的原因是：下种迟了。于是第二年，麦一收下，他就种上玉米。但是，秋后只有一成成熟，其余九成，颗粒未圆又被冻死了。这一年有了进展，他心里感到高兴，决定再继续试验。他的知心朋友谭知生劝他：“老弟！咱们这地方山高地凉，我看还是算了吧！”张世清坚定地说：“这两年试验虽失败，可也帮我摸清了玉米的脾气。再说，失败为成功之母，搞研究试验就是要战胜困难，才能取得胜利。”张世清就像愚公移山那样，一块又一块地搬掉通往科学高峰途中的绊脚石，日日夜夜战斗在山区。他详细分析了山区的气候变化，琢磨着玉米的脾气，分析失败的原因，计算出玉米成熟得一百五十天，要能再早种十天，就可以躲过早霜。接着，他又从这一百五十天推算出，玉米要在  “芒种”前四、五天下种，但小麦却在“芒种”后四、五天才能收割，要能解决这个矛盾，就能做到一年两熟。
    正在这个时候，地委书记来检查工作，鼓励张世清说：“不要被困难吓倒，共产党员面前没有什么困难不可以克服的。”党的教导时时在他的耳边回旋，更增强了他的信心。他就集中精力思索一年两熟的问题。吃饭时想，睡觉时也想。一天，吃过晚饭，他正躺在炕上想着，手掐着指头算着，回头看见老婆在锅头上淘豆芽菜。这时他猛然想到：豆芽菜能在屋里生长，要是玉米也用水催芽，然后下种，不就等于早种七、八天吗？他想到这里，兴奋地拍着炕席，说：“哈！今年有希望！”
    张世清采用温水催芽法，使玉米巧妙地躲过早霜，全部结上籽，一亩打了五百三十斤。这时节，人们都争着来看张世清试验的二槎玉米，纷纷称赞他敢想敢做的崇高风格。张世清却认为，这仅仅是个开端。他想：既然一年能够两熟，是不是还能三熟、四熟甚至五熟呢？于是他在一年两熟的基础上提出一年三熟：小麦地里套种玉米，小麦收后，玉米行间套种蔬菜，使土地一年到头都能利用。当他把这个计划在当时的农业社社委会上提出后，多数干部都极力支持他，只有监委主任何遵洲把头摇得像货郎鼓那样。会后，张世清亲自泡了三十斤种籽，背到地里准备套种。谁知何遵洲在地头上挡住了他。说：“不成！快把泡的籽给牲口拉成麸子吧！”张世清说：“能成！社委会上通过了，就得按规定办事！”何遵洲坚持说：“硬要种，你这个研究组长就把产包下来，减了产你负责！”张世清想起了地委书记的话，他拍着胸膛说：“包就包，每亩五百斤，减一斤我赔一斤！”就这样，张世清领导社员，按计划套种、间种了八亩地。经过大家的精心培植，三种庄稼都获得丰收，每亩收小麦四百四十斤，玉米七百七十六斤，白菜一千五百斤。
    在获得一年三熟的胜利基础上，张世清并没有停滞不前。他对山区无霜期和作物生长期作了仔细计算后，在去年种冬麦时，又对土地、温度、阳光等自然条件作了研究，在冬麦地里种上冬菠菜（麦子四行，二尺宽，中间隔二尺撒菠菜），第二年春天，菠菜收后，又在种菠菜的地上种上玉米，玉米出土不久，麦子即成熟收割。在收麦后，再种上生长期约一百天左右的洋黄豆。与此同时，又在玉米株间撒种胡萝卜。这样间种、套种的结果，今年在八亩地上每亩平均收了小麦七百四十七斤，洋黄豆三百五十斤，玉米三百斤，菠菜一千五百斤，胡萝卜二百斤，共计收粮食一千三百九十七斤，蔬菜一千七百斤，比当地一般田产量高出好几倍。因为是五种作物间种、套种，所以人们把这种耕作方法称作“五套连环”。甘肃省的科学领导部门认为这种充分利用地力，合理倒茬，高秆和低秆作物间作的方法，不仅是完全符合植物群体生理的原理，而且在作物配置上还合乎运筹学的原理，相对地节约了劳动力。因此，今年7月，武都县在隆兴公社召开了现场会议，决定今年秋播冬麦时，在五万亩地里推广“五套连环”这一先进耕作经验。
    光荣归功于党
    张世清在农业科学上攀登了一个高峰又一个高峰，取得了一个成就又一个成就，党也不断给予他鼓励。他先后出席全国省、专区、县各级先进生产者代表会议十三次，受奖励八次，还到北京见到伟大的领袖毛主席，并被聘为甘肃省农业科学院特约研究员。今年7月他又到苏联参观学习了二十多天，大大开阔了眼界，更加增长了他的创造智慧。张世清把一切成就都归功于党。他在今年秋收摘下自己精心培育出来又大又甜的桃子时，首先挑了一个最大最甜的桃子，要送到北京去献给敬爱的领袖毛主席，并作了一首诗：
    千桃园里千株桃，
    色红味甜赛蟠桃；
    献给领袖毛主席，
    祝他福寿比天高。
