Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 5th. The Du Youxing Youth Coal Mining Team of the Tangjiazhuang Mine in Kailuan Coal Mine has carefully studied and mastered the laws of coal mining, achieving sustained high production. This team has comprehensively overfulfilled its production tasks in the two years since its establishment. In this year's increase production and practice economy campaign, the team members' fighting spirit has become even more vigorous. From August to November, their coal mining efficiency has doubled compared to the plan, increasing the nation's output by more than 18,000 tons of raw coal.

In production, the Du Youxing Youth Coal Mining Team carefully studies production laws, analyzes potential difficulties, and frequently prepares several countermeasures to adapt to changing circumstances and maintain an active position. For example, when mining the 2590 working face, the roof pressure was too high, and there was a possibility of roof collapse affecting coal output. They researched three countermeasures: first, install support beams in advance to prevent roof collapse; second, prepare sufficient timber, and if a small collapse occurs, immediately build wooden supports to prevent the accident from expanding; and third, prepare a temporary coal output location in case an accident occurs, so as not to affect production. As a result, normal production was effectively maintained.

The Du Youxing Coal Mining Team also has a good method of summarizing and promoting advanced experience. They pay close attention to identifying advanced factors that appear on high-yield days, promptly summarizing the team's and individuals' high-yield experiences, exchanging and promoting them, and helping those lagging behind to reach advanced levels. On the basis of a general increase in production levels, new high-yield days are organized to promote continuous increase in production.

Maintaining internal unity and cooperation with other teams is also a reason why the Du Youxing Youth Team has achieved sustained high production. When assigning tasks, this team always rationally allocates labor according to physical strength, technical skill, and condition quality, helping each other and competing with each other, so that no partner falls behind. If other units have problems, they also take the initiative to help solve them. Sometimes, the night shift is unable to complete the preparatory work in time, so this team takes the initiative to send people down the well early to help the night shift work. Electric loaders are prone to problems, so the members of the Du Youxing team all learn electromechanical skills and actively help the electric loader drivers strengthen maintenance. Because they are enthusiastic about cooperating with the workers in related processes, others are also very enthusiastic about helping them.

### 杜有兴青年采煤队精心钻研采煤规律  三个多月增产一万八千吨煤

    杜有兴青年采煤队精心钻研采煤规律
    三个多月增产一万八千吨煤
    新华社天津5日电　开滦煤矿唐家庄矿杜有兴青年采煤队，精心研究和掌握采煤规律，取得持续高产。这个队建队两年来全面超额完成生产任务。在今年的增产节约运动中，队员们的斗志更加昂扬，8月至11月份的三个多月中采煤效率比计划提高一倍，为国家增产了一万八千多吨原煤。
    杜有兴青年采煤队在生产中，通过认真研究生产规律，分析生产中可能发生的困难，经常准备几种对策，以便随机应变，使自己处于主动地位。例如，开采二五九○掌子的时候，因为顶板压力太大，有冒顶影响出煤的可能。他们就研究出三种对策：一是事先打托梁，争取不冒顶；二是备有充足木料，一旦发生小的坍塌，马上打木垛，防止事故扩大；三是备有临时出煤的工作地点，以备万一出现事故，也不影响生产。结果有效地保持了生产正常进行。
    杜有兴采煤队还有一套总结推广先进经验的好办法。他们很注意找出高产日里出现的先进因素及时总结全队和个人的高产经验，交流推广，帮助后进达到先进水平。在生产水平普遍提高的基础上，又组织新的高产日，促使生产节节上升。
      始终保持队内以及同其他队的团结协作，也是杜有兴青年队取得持续高产的原因。这个队在分配任务时，总是按照体力强弱、技术高低、条件好坏合理搭配劳力，互帮互赛，不使一个伙伴掉队。别的单位有问题，他们也主动协助解决。有时夜班准备工作来不及做好，这个队就主动派人提早下井帮助夜班干活。电溜子容易出毛病，杜有兴队的队员们就人人学机电，主动帮助电溜子司机加强维护。由于他们热心和有关工序的工人们协作，别人也很热心帮助他们。
