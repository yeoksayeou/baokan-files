Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 20th. The Agricultural Middle School of Kaian People's Commune in Nong'an County, Jilin Province, integrates teaching and production labor, vigorously conducts agricultural scientific research, and actively serves agricultural production. This year, the entire school has conducted a total of twenty-three scientific research activities in aspects such as fertilization, cultivating new varieties, improving cultivation techniques, field management, cultivating crop kings, and agricultural meteorology, of which twenty-one have now been completed.

Under the guidance of teachers, students have applied the knowledge of soil and fertilizer learned from books, combined with the production experience of veteran farmers, to create methods for classifying and managing manure, scientifically using fertilizer, and transforming the alkaline soil cultivated by the school into neutral soil. They also used the photochemistry knowledge of plants to experiment with intercropping flax and sorghum, making the flax grow taller than the sorghum, increasing yield and quality.

In scientific research activities, the school's teachers and students, on the one hand, humbly learn from veteran farmers, verifying and enriching theoretical knowledge; on the other hand, they use comparative experiments to confirm the scientific principles of the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, helping some farmers to break conservative ideas and explore high-yield paths. For example, of the seven mu of wheat they planted, some land was deep-plowed and base fertilizer was applied, while the other part was not deep-plowed and base fertilizer was not applied. As a result, the former yielded three hundred and twenty jin more per mu than the latter, proving that deep plowing can increase grain production.

These research activities have played a positive role in promoting local agricultural production. The commune party committee held two on-site meetings in the school's agricultural scientific research garden to promote the advanced production experiences created by teachers and students. Various management districts have successively exchanged more than a dozen varieties and more than 5,000 jin of improved seeds from the school, and the school has become the commune's improved seed propagation station.

    教学结合实际　大搞科学研究
    开安公社农业中学积极为农业服务
    据新华社长春20日电　吉林省农安县开安人民公社农业中学结合教学和生产劳动，大搞农业科学研究，积极为农业生产服务。今年，全校在施肥、培育新品种、改良耕作技术、田间管理、培育作物王、农业气象等方面，共进行了二十三项科学研究活动，现在已完成二十一项。
    学生们在教师的指导下，应用从书本上学到的有关土壤、肥料的知识，结合学习老农的生产经验，创造了分类管理粪肥的方法，科学地使用肥料，把学校耕种的碱性土壤改造成了中性土壤。他们并运用植物的光化知识，试验了线麻、高粱间种，使线麻长得比高粱还高，提高了产量和质量。
    学校师生在科学研究活动中，一方面虚心向老农学习，验证和丰富了理论知识；另一方面又通过对比试验的方法，证实农业“八字宪法”的科学道理，帮助部分农民群众破除保守思想，探讨高产途径。例如，他们种的七亩小麦，其中一部分地进行了深翻，施了底肥，另一部分没有深翻和施底肥。结果，前者比后者每亩多产三百二十斤，证明了深翻能够多打粮。
    这些研究活动，对推动当地的农业生产起了积极作用。公社党委在学校的农业科学研究园地里召开过两次现场会，推广师生们创造的先进生产经验。各管理区曾先后向学校换去良种十几种、五千多斤，学校成了公社的良种繁殖站。
