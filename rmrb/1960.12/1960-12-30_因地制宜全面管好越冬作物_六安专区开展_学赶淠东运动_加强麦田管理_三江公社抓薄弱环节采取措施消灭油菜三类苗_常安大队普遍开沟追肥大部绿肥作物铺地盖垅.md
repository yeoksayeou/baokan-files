Manage Overwintering Crops Comprehensively According to Local Conditions
Liu'an Prefecture Launches "Learn from and Catch Up with Pidong Campaign" to Strengthen Wheat Field Management
Sanjiang Commune Grasps Weak Links and Takes Measures to Eliminate Third-Class Seedlings in Rapeseed
Chang'an Brigade Universally Digs Ditches and Applies Fertilizer, Most Green Manure Crops Cover the Ridges
(Reported by this newspaper) The mass movement in Anhui to "Learn from Pidong, Catch up with Pidong" is unfolding in depth in Liu'an Prefecture. Production teams in all communes throughout the region are vigorously promoting the advanced experience of "three greens and two yellows" of the Pidong Brigade of Pidong Commune, based on the current growth of wheat seedlings and in accordance with local conditions. A total of 300,000 people have been mobilized throughout the prefecture to strengthen wheat field management. According to incomplete statistics, more than 640,000 mu of land in the prefecture has been checked for seedlings and replanted, more than 300,000 mu has been fertilized, and more than 150,000 mu has been weeded.

Organizing the masses to "Learn from Pidong, Catch up with Pidong" in wheat production is an important measure taken by the Liu'an Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China to lead the vast number of commune members in the region to promote the high-yield experience of Pidong Brigade, a high-yield unit of wheat over a large area in the province, transform the production level of advanced units into the production level of the entire region, and continuously improve the yield per unit area of wheat. As Party committees at all levels have further strengthened their leadership in this movement, the sowing quality of wheat in various places this year is better than in previous years. As soon as autumn sowing ended, various localities continued their efforts to learn and promote the advanced experience of Pidong Brigade in wheat field management based on the growth pattern of "three greens and two yellows" of wheat in wheat field management.

In learning the advanced experience of "three greens and two yellows," various localities have earnestly implemented the principle of adapting to local conditions. In order to closely combine the management experience of "three greens and two yellows" of Pidong Brigade with the management experience of their own commune over the years, Xiadian Commune in Huoqiu County specifically convened a meeting of cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians, and formulated effective measures based on the current situation, such as checking seedlings and replanting, timely fertilization, rational irrigation, timely drainage, cultivation and weeding, and frost and cold protection. After the meeting, each production team organized more than 2,100 commune members and first replanted the wheat fields with missing seedlings.

When promoting the advanced experience of "three greens and two yellows," various localities have earnestly promoted the evaluation of work points and the production responsibility system, further stimulating the labor enthusiasm of grassroots cadres and commune members.

(Reported by this newspaper) Sanjiang People's Commune in Chongqing County, Sichuan Province, has launched a "four catch-up" campaign: catching up early sowing with late sowing of rapeseed, catching up strong seedlings with weak seedlings, catching up transplanted rapeseed seedlings with direct sowing, and catching up high-yield fields with low-yield fields, striving to eliminate third-class seedlings in winter.

Not long ago, the Sanjiang Commune Party Committee organized cadres and commune member representatives from various management districts to conduct a major inspection of spring crops in the field. They found that rapeseed this year was generally planted more and managed well, but there were still weak links. According to past experience, winter is the period for rapeseed to develop, expand, and branch, and if managed well, it will play a significant role in increasing rapeseed production. To this end, the commune Party committee called on all commune members to immediately launch the "four catch-up" campaign to eliminate third-class seedlings this winter.

After the "four catch-up" slogan was put forward, it greatly encouraged cadres and the masses to manage rapeseed well. Responsible cadres at the commune, district, and team levels selected poor fields with different soil types such as Er Cao Tian (double rice paddy), sticky mud fields, and stony fields as rapeseed model fields to create experience and guide the movement of low-yield rapeseed fields catching up with high-yield fields. Responsible cadres at all levels personally took command, leading more than 150 rapeseed management professional groups to fight in the fields.

Various localities have adopted different technical measures for managing rapeseed according to local conditions and seedlings. At present, the 124 mu of late-sown rapeseed in the Eighth Management District has been fertilized three times and loosened the soil once, and is growing vigorously. After more than a month of concentrated management, more than 10,000 mu of rapeseed in the entire commune has been universally checked for seedlings, replanted, thinned, and fertilized three or four times, and the soil has been loosened one or two times. Now, 80% of the rapeseed in the entire commune has achieved full and even seedlings, with each plant growing robustly; 40% has already expanded and covered the field, growing better than in any previous year.

(Reported by this newspaper) Chang'an Brigade of Dongfeng Commune in Changde County, Hunan Province, has deeply mobilized the masses, earnestly implemented policies, strengthened green manure cultivation and management, and protected safe overwintering. At present, more than 2,400 mu of green manure in the brigade has been ditched, meeting the quality requirements of straight and deep ditches and dry fields after rain. A seedling-promoting and heat-preserving fertilizer has been universally applied once, and a second heat-preserving ash fertilizer has been applied to 250 mu of third-class seedlings. Now, most of the green manure has covered the ground and ridges, reaching a depth of about five inches.

The soil in this brigade is mostly King Kong soil and yellow clay soil, and there was no habit of planting green manure in the past. It was only in 1958 that 420 mu were trial-planted, and this year it has been expanded to more than 2,400 mu, accounting for 85% of the total paddy field area. In order to cultivate green manure as well as rice, the brigade Party branch fully mobilized the masses and summarized the experiences and lessons learned from planting green manure in the brigade over the past two years. Through mass summary and discussion, the thinking of cadres and the masses was unified. In order to strengthen the responsibility system for green manure cultivation and management, the method of three guarantees to the production team, management to the individual, and full awards for overproduction was implemented. Experienced farmers and cadres were organized to inspect the fields and assess the grade and yield of each plot according to soil quality and other conditions. The land was divided into three grades, and the contract output was carried out according to the perennial output of each grade, based on the principle of achievable overproduction, and the work points and costs were also contracted accordingly. After the three guarantees were implemented to the team, a field management responsibility system was immediately established, and management groups were established, with fixed commune members responsible for regular field management work.

On the basis of the three guarantees being implemented to the team and management responsibility being assigned to individuals, each production unit immediately launched a cultivation and management campaign centered on ditching and fertilization. The branch secretary and brigade cadres took the lead and worked with the masses to study and determine technical measures. Many Party members and members of the Communist Youth League in each production team served as leaders of the ditching and fertilization groups. In ditching and fertilization, in order to adapt to local conditions, each team convened meetings of experienced farmers and commune member meetings to democratically decide on specific measures.

    常安大队普遍开沟追肥大部绿肥作物铺地盖垅
    本报讯　安徽“学淠东、赶淠东”的群众运动正在六安专区深入展开。全区各公社的生产小队，正根据当前麦苗生长情况，因地制宜地大力推广淠东公社淠东大队“三青两黄”的先进经验，全专区共出动了三十万人加强麦田管理。据不完全统计，全专区已经查苗补苗六十四万多亩，追肥三十多万亩，锄草十五万多亩。
    在小麦生产上，组织群众“学淠东、赶淠东”，是中共六安地委领导全区广大社员，因地制宜推广全省小麦大面积高产单位——淠东大队的丰产经验，变先进单位的生产水平为全区的生产水平，不断提高小麦单位面积产量的一项重要的措施。由于各级党委进一步加强了这一运动的领导，今年各地小麦的播种质量都比往年好。秋种一结束，各地又继续努力，在麦田管理工作中学习和推广了淠东大队根据小麦“三青两黄”生长规律，进行麦田管理的先进经验。
    各地在学习“三青两黄”的先进经验时，都认真贯彻了因地制宜的原则。霍丘县夏店公社为了把淠东大队的“三青两黄”管理经验和本社历年来管理经验紧密结合起来，专门召开了干部、老农和技术人员会议，根据当前情况制订了查苗补苗、适时追肥、合理灌溉、及时排水、中耕锄草以及防霜防冻等项有效措施。会后，各生产小队组织了二千一百多名社员，首先补齐了缺苗的麦田。
    在推广“三青两黄”的先进经验的时候，各地认真推行了评工记分和生产责任制，进一步激发了基层干部和社员的劳动积极性。
    本报讯　四川崇庆县三江人民公社开展油菜迟栽赶早栽、弱苗赶壮苗、直播菜子赶移栽菜子、低产田赶高产田的“四赶”运动，力争在冬季消灭三类苗。
    三江公社党委在不久以前，组织各管区的干部和社员代表，进行了小春田间管理大检查。他们发现，今年油菜一般都种得多管得好，但是还有薄弱环节。根据过去的经验：冬季是油菜发育开盘、分枝的时期，如果管理得好，对油菜增产有极大作用。为此，公社党委号召全体社员立即开展“四赶”运动，把三类苗消灭在今冬。
      “四赶”口号提出后，大大鼓舞了干部、群众管好油菜的干劲。社、区、队三级的负责干部，选择了二漕田、粘泥田、石骨田等不同土质的孬田，作为油菜样板田，创造经验，指导油菜低产田赶高产田的运动。各级负责干部都亲自挂帅，领导一百五十多个油菜管理专业组，奋战田间。
    各地因地因苗制宜，采取了管理油菜的不同的技术措施。目前，第八管理区的一百二十四亩迟栽油菜，已追肥三次，松土一次，生长茂盛。全社经过一个多月的突击管理，一万多亩油菜普遍查了苗，补了苗，定了苗和追肥三、四次，松土一、二次。现在，全社的油菜有80％做到了苗全苗齐，株株茁壮；有40％已经开盘，铺满田面，长得比以往任何一年都好。
    本报讯　湖南常德县东风公社常安大队深入发动群众，认真贯彻政策，加强绿肥培育管理，保护安全越冬。目前，全大队二千四百多亩绿肥已开好了沟，达到了沟直沟深、雨住田干的质量要求。并普遍追施了一次提苗保温肥，还有二百五十亩三类苗已追上第二次保温灰肥。现在，绿肥大都已铺地盖垅，约五寸左右深。
    这个大队土质多系金刚土和黄泥粘土，过去没有种绿肥习惯。1958年才试种四百二十亩，今年扩种到二千四百多亩，占总水田面积的85％。大队党总支为了实现像培育稻谷一样地培育好绿肥，充分发动群众，总结了两年来本队种植绿肥的经验教训。通过群众性的总结讨论，统一了干部和群众的思想。为了加强绿肥培育管理责任制，实行了三包到生产小队，管理到人，超产全奖的办法，组织老农和干部临田察看，按照土质好坏等条件，逐丘鉴定等级和产量，将土地分为三等，根据各等田的常年产量，本着有产可超的原则进行包产，并把工分和成本也相应的包好。三包落实到小队后，随即建立了田间管理责任制，建立了管理小组，固定了社员负责经常的田间管理工作。
    在三包落实到队管理责任到人的基础上，各生产单位随即掀起了以开沟追肥为中心的培育管理运动。总支书记和大队干部都带头行动，和群众一起研究确定技术措施。各生产小队中的许多党团员都担任开沟、追肥小组长。在开沟追肥中，为了做到因地制宜，各小队都召开了老农座谈会和社员会，民主决定了具体措施。（附图片）
