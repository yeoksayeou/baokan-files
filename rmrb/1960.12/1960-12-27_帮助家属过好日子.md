The Party Committee of the Tianjin No. 6 Cotton Mill has included arranging the lives of employees' families in its work plan, established a special organization, and assigned dedicated personnel to be responsible for this work.

The factory's Party Committee frequently mobilizes Party members, Youth League members, and veteran workers to cooperate with key members of the families to understand the living conditions, grain consumption plans, and winter preparations of employees' families, and help families make specific arrangements. Jin Guichen, a worker in the combing group, had a wife who did not plan well for her daily life, often experiencing a "loose at the beginning, tight at the end" situation. Yan Shufen, the group's welfare officer, visited her three times to help her calculate detailed accounts and develop a living plan. Jin Guichen's family life quickly changed. Now they have monthly plans and daily arrangements, and their life is prosperous. Some workers have both husband and wife working, and no one at home to buy things. The factory's Party Committee has set up life service stations in the workshops to buy oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and daily necessities on their behalf, and contacted grain stores to deliver grain to their door on a regular basis. Since the beginning of winter, the factory's Party Committee has also investigated the winter preparations of employees' families twice, helping some families take apart and wash clothes, and install stoves, which has been welcomed by the families.

    帮助家属过好日子
    天津国棉六厂党委把安排职工家属生活列入自己的工作规划，成立专门组织，抽出专人负责这项工作。
    工厂党委经常发动党团员和老工人，配合家属中的骨干分子，了解职工家庭生活、计划用粮、过冬准备等情况，帮助家属做好具体安排。并条小组工人金贵臣的爱人，过去过日子没有计划，经常出现前松后紧现象。小组生活福利员阎淑芬连续三次登门协助她算细账，制定生活计划，金贵臣的家庭生活很快变了样。现在月有计划，日有安排，小日子富富裕裕。有的工人夫妻双方都工作，家中没有人买东西。工厂党委就在车间设立了生活服务站，代买油盐酱醋和生活日用品，并且跟粮店联系，按期把粮食送上门。入冬以来，工厂党委还先后两次调查了职工家庭的过冬准备情况，帮助一部分家属拆洗衣服，安装炉子，受到家属们的欢迎。（附图片）
