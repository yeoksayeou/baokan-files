Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, December 13th. Albanian Chairman of the Council of Ministers Shehu sent a telegram on the 12th to the President of the United Nations General Assembly and the President of the Security Council, lodging a protest from the Albanian government and demanding prompt and effective measures to end the grave situation created by the imperialist aggressors in the Congo.

In his telegram, Shehu pointed out that the events that have occurred in the Republic of the Congo in recent days have aroused deep anger among the Albanian people and serious concern among all peace-loving countries.

The telegram stated that the lives of Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba and other Congolese leaders are in danger. These inhuman acts and the terror of the Mobutu rebel group are an integral part of the aggressive activities of the American imperialists and other colonialist countries of the North Atlantic bloc against the independence of the Congolese people. We believe that Mobutu's unreasonable expulsion of the diplomatic representatives of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Ghana in Leopoldville, as well as the severance of diplomatic relations with the United Arab Republic, is a provocative act aimed at isolating the Congolese people in the face of the attacks of their mortal enemies, the imperialists.

The telegram said: "American imperialism attempts to seize the wealth of the Congo, replace the colonialists such as Belgium, turn the Congo into a base for aggression against other independent African countries and against world peace, attempt to abolish the legitimate government and parliament of the Congo, divide the Congo, and eliminate the Republic of the Congo as an independent and sovereign state. We are even more angered by the fact that this aggression and these criminal activities are carried out under the banner of the United Nations, with the active help and cooperation of UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld and his representatives in the Congo." The telegram pointed out that the Albanian government believes that these actions of the colonialist-imperialist aggressors under the guise of the United Nations threaten the existence of the Republic of the Congo and constitute a serious threat to other African countries and to universal peace.

The Albanian government demands the immediate release of Prime Minister Lumumba and other arrested Congolese leaders, the restoration of the activities of the legitimate government under the leadership of Lumumba and the parliament, the cessation of American imperialist aggression and interference, the complete expulsion of the Belgian colonialists, the disarmament of the criminal group of the traitor Mobutu, and the punishment of the criminals.

Albania demands that the United Nations General Assembly immediately study the situation in the Congo, and demands that the Security Council take effective measures on the proposals of the Soviet government, which are currently under discussion and fully supported by the Albanian government.

Shehu requested that this telegram be distributed as an official document to all member states of the United Nations.

Shehu said that the Albanian government believes that the imperialists will eventually be bruised and battered, the just cause of the Congolese people will surely triumph, colonialism in any form is doomed to be completely eliminated, and the people of Africa and the world will loudly defend the heroic and peace-loving Congolese people.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 13th. Dr. Dieckmann, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, sent a telegram to the President of the Fifteenth United Nations General Assembly, condemning the fascist atrocities of the Mobutu group and demanding the restoration of the normal activities of the Parliament of the Republic of the Congo.

The telegram pointed out that Mobutu and his accomplices used the methods once used by the German fascists to deal with the Congolese Parliament. Not only was the parliament deprived of all possibilities of carrying out its work, but even the legally elected government headed by Prime Minister Lumumba was forcibly prevented from working for the interests of the Republic of the Congo, "which only conforms to the current policy adopted by the imperialists of infringing on the rights of the Republic of the Congo and disrupting its order."

The Presidium of the German United Nations Association also sent a telegram to the United Nations Security Council and its current President Zorin, requesting the Security Council to take immediate measures to ensure the release of Lumumba and to stop the terrorist activities of the Mobutu rioters against the Congolese people.

    抗议美国对刚果的侵略干涉
    狄克曼谴责蒙博托集团暴行要求恢复刚果议会活动
    新华社地拉那13日电　阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席谢胡12日致电联合国大会主席和安全理事会主席，提出了阿尔巴尼亚政府的抗议，要求采取迅速而有效的措施，结束帝国主义侵略者在刚果所造成的严重局势。
    谢胡在电报中指出，最近几天来在刚果共和国所发生的事件，使阿尔巴尼亚人民深感愤怒，引起了一切爱好和平国家的严重不安。
    电报说，刚果共和国总理卢蒙巴和刚果其它领导人的生命在危险中。这些非人道的行为和蒙博托叛乱集团的恐怖行为，是反对刚果人民独立的美帝国主义者和北大西洋集团的其它殖民主义国家的侵略活动的不可分割的一部分。我们认为，蒙博托无理驱逐苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和加纳在利奥波德维尔的外交代表，以及同阿拉伯联合共和国断绝外交关系，是一种挑衅行为，其目的在于使刚果人民在他们的死敌帝国主义者的攻击面前陷于孤立。
    电报说：“美帝国主义企图攫取刚果的财富，取代比利时等殖民主义者的地位，把刚果变成侵略非洲其他独立国家和反对世界和平的基地，企图取消刚果合法政府和议会，瓜分刚果和消灭作为独立自主国家的刚果共和国。这种侵略和这些罪恶活动，都是打着联合国的旗帜，在联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德及其在刚果的代表积极帮助和合作下进行的，这一事实使我们更加愤怒。”电报指出，阿尔巴尼亚政府认为，在联合国名义掩盖下的殖民主义者—帝国主义侵略者的这些行为，威胁着刚果共和国的存在，构成了对非洲其他国家和普遍和平的严重威胁。
    阿尔巴尼亚政府要求立即释放卢蒙巴总理和被捕的刚果其他领导人，使他们恢复在卢蒙巴和议会领导下的合法政府的活动，停止美帝国主义者的侵略和干涉，全部驱逐比利时殖民主义者，解除叛徒蒙博托罪恶集团的武装和制裁罪犯。
    阿尔巴尼亚要求联合国大会立即研究刚果的局势，要求安理会就正在讨论的、并得到阿尔巴尼亚政府完全支持的苏联政府的建议，采取有效措施。
    谢胡要求将这一份电报作为正式文件分发给联合国的所有会员国。
    谢胡说，阿尔巴尼亚政府相信，帝国主义者终将碰得头破血流，刚果人民的正义事业必将取得胜利，任何形式的殖民主义都注定要被彻底消灭，非洲和全世界的人民将大声疾呼保卫英勇和爱好和平的刚果人民。
    新华社柏林13日电　德意志民主共和国人民议院主席团主席狄克曼博士，打电报给第十五届联合国大会主席，谴责蒙博托集团的法西斯暴行，要求恢复刚果共和国议会的正常活动。
    电报指出，蒙博托及其同谋者使用了德国法西斯分子曾经使用过的手段来对付刚果议会。不仅议会被剥夺了进行工作的一切可能性，就连以卢蒙巴总理为首的依法选举产生的政府也被用武力阻挠为刚果共和国的利益而进行工作，“这只符合于帝国主义者目前所采取的侵犯刚果共和国的权利并破坏其秩序的方针”。
    德国联合国协会主席团也打电报给联合国安全理事会及其现任主席佐林，要求安全理事会立即采取措施，使卢蒙巴获得释放，制止蒙博托暴乱分子继续对刚果人民进行的恐怖活动。
