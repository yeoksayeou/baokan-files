    Thorough Ideological Work
    Yi Qing
    The political and ideological work of the Green Lake Brigade Party Branch provides us with a valuable experience: ideological work must be thorough.
    People's thoughts vary, and their levels of awareness differ. To do ideological work is to raise the awareness of those with lower awareness, and to further improve the awareness of those with higher awareness. For people's ideological awareness to change from low to high, and for the high to become even higher, there must be a process. Because people's ideological understanding, from incorrect to correct, is not a sudden change, but a gradual change. A person's mistaken understanding of a matter cannot be changed all at once; a person's overall ideological awareness is not suddenly raised by an isolated event; a person's view of this matter may be correct today, but tomorrow, as the situation develops, his thinking may not keep up with the development of the situation, and he may see it incorrectly; a person's view of this matter may be correct, but his view of another matter may not be correct. Precisely because people's thoughts have these characteristics, ideological work must be thorough. To be thorough does not simply mean simple propaganda, but repeated, patient, specific, and detailed education, enlightenment, and improvement from many aspects, re-education, re-enlightenment, and re-improvement, so that constant quantitative change leads to qualitative change, from low-level to high-level, continuous cycle, continuous deepening, and continuous improvement. The Green Lake Brigade Party Branch, on the basis of conducting general education for the commune member Pang Shibo, also repeatedly conducted individual education and recall-comparison education, finally making Pang Shibo a "Five-Good" commune member. It can be seen that the process of thorough ideological work is also a process of quantitative change to qualitative change, from low-level to high-level, deepening step by step, and improving step by step.
    How can ideological work be thorough? The experience of the Green Lake Brigade is to grasp these two ends: one end is the thinking from above, and the other end is the thinking from below. The thinking from above is the Party's line, principles, instructions, policies, and tasks; the thinking from below is the specific thinking of the masses. The Green Lake Brigade Party Branch frequently and repeatedly publicizes the Party's line, principles, policies, instructions, and tasks to the masses, not only explaining how the principles, policies, instructions, and tasks are stipulated, but also explaining why they are stipulated in this way and why not in that way. In this way, the Party's will and the Party's thinking are promptly implemented among the masses. At the same time, when conducting the above education, they always pay attention to understanding the specific ideological situation of the masses and conduct ideological work that addresses the specific problems. The Green Lake Brigade's series of methods, such as the combination of universal education and individual education, the combination of reasoning and presenting facts, and the combination of ideological education and solving practical problems, are all aimed at conducting ideological work based on the actual situation of the masses. Conducting ideological work in this way, combining the practical and the theoretical, can achieve the desired results, truly make the ideological work thorough, truly make political and ideological work reach the heavens and penetrate the earth, truly make the Party's thinking and the Party's will deeply rooted in the minds of every commune member, and make people more actively, more consciously, and more vividly do a good job in the Party's various tasks.

    把思想工作做透
    怡清
    绿湖大队党支部的政治思想工作给我们提供了一条有益的经验，这就是：思想工作要做透。
    人们的思想各有不同，觉悟有高有低。做思想工作也就是使觉悟较低的人提高觉悟，使觉悟较高的人更提高一步。要使人们的思想觉悟从低变高，高的变得更高，都要有一个过程。因为人们的思想认识，从不正确到正确，都不是突变的，是渐变的，一个人对一件事情的错误认识，并不是一下子就能改变过来的；一个人的整个思想觉悟，也不是通过一件孤立的事情，就突然提高起来的；一个人今天对这件事情的看法是正确的，明天，形势发展了，他的思想跟不上形势的发展，也可能看得不正确；一个人对这件事情的看法是正确的，对另一件事情的看法也可能不正确。正因为人们的思想有这些特点，所以思想工作要做透。做透，就是不光是简简单单宣传一下，而是反复、耐心、具体、细致地从多方面进行教育、启发、提高，再教育、再启发、再提高，如此不断从量变到质变，从低级到高级，不断循环，不断加深，不断提高。绿湖大队党支部对社员庞世保，在进行普遍教育的基础上，又反复不断进行了个别教育，回忆对比教育，终于使庞世保成为“五好”社员。可见，思想工作做透的过程，也正是从量变到质变，从低级到高级，步步加深，步步提高的过程。
    思想工作怎样才能做透？绿湖大队的经验是要抓这样的两头，一头是上面的思想，一头是下面的思想。上面的思想就是党的路线、方针、指示、政策、任务；下面的思想就是群众的具体思想。绿湖大队党支部经常把党的路线、方针、政策、指示、任务，向群众反复宣传，不但讲明方针、政策、指示、任务是如何规定的，而且讲明为什么这样规定，为什么不那样规定。这样就把党的意志和党的思想及时贯彻到群众当中去。同时，他们在进行以上教育时，又时时注意摸清群众的具体思想情况，进行对症下药的思想工作。绿湖大队所采取的普遍教育与个别教育相结合、讲道理与摆事实相结合以及思想教育与解决实际问题相结合等一系列的办法，都是针对群众的实际情况进行思想工作的。这样虚实结合地进行思想工作，能够收到预期的效果，真正把思想工作做透，使政治思想工作真正通天入地，使党的思想、党的意志真正深入到每个社员的思想深处，使人们更积极、更自觉、更生动地做好党的各项工作。
