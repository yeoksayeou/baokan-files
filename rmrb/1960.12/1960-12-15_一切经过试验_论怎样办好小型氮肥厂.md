    Everything Through Experimentation
    ——On How to Run Small Nitrogen Fertilizer Plants Well
    The following three pieces of material illustrate an important issue.
    One is about a small nitrogen fertilizer plant with an annual output of 800 tons of synthetic ammonia, established by the Jinan Chemical Fertilizer Plant in Shandong Province (a news item about this was published on page 4 of this newspaper on October 31st). From the very beginning of its construction, the factory's Party committee conducted serious research and analysis, focusing on the characteristics of synthetic ammonia production equipment, which is complex, technically demanding, and highly precise. Before the equipment was installed, all the engineering and technical personnel of the factory were assembled to carefully inspect each component, even each screw, of the entire set of equipment that had been delivered to the factory, and any defects were corrected in a timely manner. During the installation process, after one process was installed, trial production was carried out on that process, and experience was summarized to create conditions for the installation of the next process. During the initial production process, they actively, cautiously, and continuously improved the equipment, and thus quickly broke through the technical barriers of nitrogen fertilizer production and entered into normal production.
    Another is about the Wuhu Small Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant in Anhui Province. This plant is also now producing close to its designed capacity because it underwent careful inspection and strict testing before being officially put into production (see today's report on this page).
    The third is about a small nitrogen fertilizer plant with an annual output of 800 tons of synthetic ammonia, established by the Jianghuai Fertilizer Plant in Hefei, Anhui Province (see today's report on this page). At the beginning of its construction, this plant did not pay enough attention to the characteristics of nitrogen fertilizer production equipment, which is complex and technically demanding. Some defects were latent in the equipment manufacturing itself; during installation, things were not done according to technical requirements, and without strict testing, they rashly put it into production before many key technical problems had been completely resolved. As a result, after only a few days of production, most of the equipment could not continue to operate. Later, after thorough inspection, the reasons for not being able to produce normally were found, a thorough overhaul was carried out, and after several trial productions, many key technical problems were solved, and finally the laws of normal production were found, and gradually normal production was achieved.
    What important issue do these three pieces of material illustrate? They illustrate that in launching any new undertaking, we must both boldly mobilize the masses and ensure that everything goes through experimentation. Whenever things are done in accordance with this policy, things will be done quickly and well; otherwise, we may take detours.
    For a new thing, there is a process of getting to know its "temperament" and becoming familiar with its regularity. The foundation of understanding is practice. Therefore, we must constantly summarize experience and improve our understanding in practice. In industrial construction, many of the projects we build are also unfamiliar or not familiar enough to us. Therefore, before officially putting it into production, there must be a process of experimentation. During the installation and trial production process, carefully discover problems and summarize experience, so that we can be confident that after this project is officially put into production, normal production can be carried out smoothly.
    Small nitrogen fertilizer plants with an annual output of 800 tons of synthetic ammonia are a new thing on the chemical industry front. Although we have some preliminary experience in running large-scale fertilizer industries, we have no experience in running this kind of small nitrogen fertilizer plant. Although small nitrogen fertilizer plants are small in scale, their characteristics of complex equipment, technically demanding, and high precision are similar to those of large nitrogen fertilizer plants, so they must not be taken lightly. To master the laws of construction and production of this type of small nitrogen fertilizer plant, it must also go through experimentation. The Jianghuai Fertilizer Plant in Hefei, Anhui Province, suffered losses and took detours because it did not pay attention to this at the beginning, and had to pay double the price before gradually achieving normal production.
    The working method of everything through experimentation is a serious and down-to-earth working method. It is a scientific working method that makes our subjective understanding conform to objective reality. Why should every component and every screw of a small nitrogen fertilizer plant's equipment be carefully inspected? Why should each process be strictly tested after the equipment is installed? This is required by the objective things themselves. Because a set of small nitrogen fertilizer plant equipment has about four thousand eight hundred units (pieces), if one unit (piece), or even one screw, does not meet the requirements, it will affect the normal production in the future. The process of nitrogen fertilizer production is a process of continuous chemical reaction through pipes of different sizes and thicknesses, and the previous process and the next process are closely linked. If a certain process is put into production without careful testing, and something goes wrong, it will immediately affect the progress of the entire production. Blindly putting into production without experimentation means that subjective understanding and objective laws are still in a state of separation, and the result is naturally that normal production cannot be carried out. After careful experimentation, problems are discovered and the key is found, and the subjective and objective are basically consistent, which means that people have mastered the objective laws of small nitrogen fertilizer plant production, and normal production can naturally be carried out smoothly. The examples of the Jinan Fertilizer Plant in Shandong Province and the Wuhu Fertilizer Plant in Anhui Province are good proofs.
    What we have discussed above is how to understand and grasp the laws of production of small nitrogen fertilizer plants. To ensure the rapid and normal production of this type of small nitrogen fertilizer plant, of course, there must be other conditions, such as the normal supply of water, electricity, and gas; the normal supply of coke; the necessary maintenance force and the preparation of spare parts, etc. If these conditions are not available or insufficient, it will still be difficult to carry out normal production.
    At present, nearly a hundred small nitrogen fertilizer plants are being built across the country; in order to enable this huge force supporting agricultural production to play a role quickly, the important issue at present is that each region must first run one or several "model" plants well. What is a "model" plant? It is a plant that has undergone strict testing, has truly passed the technical and management barriers, and can produce normally for a considerable period of time. If a region has one or several such "model" plants as examples, the construction and normal production of other plants will be much faster and more assured.
    Running nearly a hundred small nitrogen fertilizer plants well is a very important task for industry to support agriculture. A small nitrogen fertilizer plant with an annual output of 800 tons of synthetic ammonia can produce 3,000 tons of ammonia water containing 18% to 20% ammonia each year. Each jin of ammonia water can increase grain production by about three to five jin; calculated at three jin, a small nitrogen fertilizer plant with an annual output of 800 tons of synthetic ammonia can increase grain production by 18 million jin each year. The rapid completion and normal production of these nearly a hundred small nitrogen fertilizer plants will play a certain role in striving for a bumper agricultural harvest next year, especially for future large-scale development, it has an important role. Therefore, comrades on the chemical industry front must concentrate their efforts, adhere to the principle of everything through experimentation, and do this work well with full enthusiasm and in a practical manner.

    一切经过试验
    ——论怎样办好小型氮肥厂
    下面的三件材料，说明了一个重要问题。
    一件是关于山东济南化学肥料厂兴办的一个年产八百吨合成氨的小型氮肥厂（本报10月31日四版发表过消息）。这个厂从一开始建设的时候，工厂党委就针对合成氨生产设备复杂、技术性强、精密度高的特点，作了认真的研究和分析。在设备安装之前，又集中全厂的工程技术人员对进厂的全套设备，每个部件甚至每个螺丝钉，都进行了细致的检查，发现缺陷及时纠正。在安装过程中，一个工序安装完了，就在这个工序进行试生产，总结一次经验，为下一个工序的安装创造条件。在开始生产过程中，他们又积极慎重地不断改进设备，因此很快就突破了氮肥生产的技术关，转入正常生产。
    一件是关于安徽芜湖小型氮肥厂。这个厂也是由于在正式投入生产前经过了认真的检查和严格的试验，现在生产已接近设计能力（见今日本版报道）。
    另一件是关于安徽合肥江淮化肥厂所办的一个年产八百吨合成氨的小型氮肥厂（见今日本版报道）。这个厂在开始建设的时候，对氮肥生产设备复杂技术性强的特点重视不够，在设备制造方面本来就潜伏着一些缺陷；安装时，又没有按照技术要求办事，没有经过严格的试验，许多技术关键问题还没有彻底解决，就草率投入生产。结果生产了没有几天，大部分设备就不能继续运转了。后来，经过深入检查，找出不能正常生产的原因，进行了彻底的检修，又经过多次试生产，解决了许多技术关键问题，终于找出了正常生产的规律，逐步达到正常生产。
    这三件材料说明了什么重要问题呢？说明了我们兴办任何一项新的事业，既要放手发动群众，又要一切经过试验。凡是按照这项政策办事，事情就办得又快又好，反之，就可能走弯路。
    对于一项新事物，要摸清它的“脾气”，熟悉它的规律性，有一个认识的过程。认识的基础是实践。因此，必须在实践中不断总结经验，提高认识。在工业建设中，我们建设的项目，有许多也是我们所不熟悉或者不够熟悉的。因此在正式投入生产以前，必须要有一个试验的过程。在安装和试生产的过程中，认真发现问题，总结经验，就有把握在这个项目正式投入生产以后，能够顺利地进行正常生产。
    年产八百吨合成氨的小型氮肥厂是化学工业战线上的一项新事物。虽然我们对办大型化肥工业，已经有了一些初步的经验，但对办这种小型氮肥厂，却没有什么经验。小型氮肥厂规模虽小，但设备复杂、技术性强、精密度高的特点却和大型氮肥厂差不多，因而切不可等闲视之。要掌握这种小型氮肥厂的建设和生产规律，也必须经过试验。安徽合肥的江淮化肥厂，就是由于开始时没有重视这一点，结果吃了亏，走了弯路，不得不付出双倍的代价，才逐步做到正常生产。
    一切经过试验的工作方法，是一种认真踏实的工作方法。是使我们的主观认识符合客观实际的科学的工作方法。为什么对于小型氮肥厂设备的一个部件、一个螺丝钉都要认真检查？为什么设备安好以后，每个工序都要经过严格试验？这是客观事物本身所要求的。因为一套小型氮肥厂的设备，约有四千八百多台（件），其中某一台（件）、甚至某一个螺丝不合要求，都会影响到日后的正常生产。氮肥生产的过程是通过大小粗细不同的管道进行连续的化学反应的过程，上一道工序和下一道工序之间是紧密相联的，如果某一道工序没有经过认真的试验就投入生产，出了毛病，立即会影响到整个生产的进行。不经过试验就盲目投入生产，主观认识和客观规律还处在分裂的状态，结果自然不能正常生产。经过认真的试验，发现了问题，找到了关键，主客观基本上相一致了，也就是人掌握了小氮肥厂生产的客观规律，自然就能顺利地正常生产了。山东济南化肥厂和安徽芜湖化肥厂的例子，就是很好的证明。
    我们上面谈的是如何认识和掌握小型氮肥厂的生产规律，要保证这种小型氮肥厂迅速正常生产，当然还要有其它条件，诸如水、电、气的正常供应；焦炭的正常供应；必要的检修力量和备品配件的准备等等，这些条件不具备或者不充分，进行正常生产还是困难的。
    目前，全国各地正在建设着近百个小型氮肥厂；为了使这批支援农业生产的巨大力量迅速发生作用，当前的重要问题，是每个地区要首先办好一个或者几个“样板”厂。什么叫“样板”厂？就是经过严格的试验，在技术上、管理上确实已经过了关，并且在一个相当长的时间中都能正常生产的厂子。一个地区有了一个或者几个这样的“样板”厂作样子，其它厂子的建设和正常生产，就快得多，也有把握得多了。
    办好近百个小型氮肥厂，是工业支援农业的一项很重要的工作。一个年产八百吨合成氨的小型氮肥厂，每年可以生产出三千吨含氨18％至20％的氨水，每斤氨水约可增产三斤至五斤粮食；按三斤计算，一个年产八百吨合成氨的小型氮肥厂每年生产出来的氨水，就可以增产一千八百万斤粮食。这近百个小型氮肥厂的迅速建成和正常生产，对于争取明年农业大丰收将起着一定的作用，特别是对于今后的大量发展，有着重要的作用。因此，化学工业战线上的同志们，一定要集中力量，坚持一切经过试验的原则，干劲十足又切切实实地把这项工作办好。
