The "December 9th" Movement

In the period leading up to the "December 9th" incident in 1935, Japanese imperialism intensified its aggression against China. Following the signing of the Tanggu Truce and the He (Yingqin)-Mei (Jinxiong) traitorous agreements, the Nanjing Kuomintang government issued the so-called "Good Neighborliness Order." All patriotic individuals resisting Japan were branded with the crime of "endangering the Republic of China" and subjected to suppression and persecution. At that time, traitors ran rampant everywhere, a puppet organization was established in eastern Hebei, and Japanese military police and Kuomintang secret agents arrested people everywhere. At this moment, the Chinese Communist Party issued the "August 1st Manifesto," calling on the whole country to unite against Japan, a proposition that received a response from the people of the entire nation. Young students, filled with righteous indignation, wanted to step forward and express the true sentiments of the patriotic people. On November 18th, the "Peiping Student Union" was established to carry out patriotic and anti-Japanese activities and combat the shameless activities of traitors.

On December 3rd, the Third Congress of the Student Union decided to take action to represent the will of the youth of North China. On the same day, the Second Plenary Student Congress of Tsinghua University passed a resolution to "send a telegram to the whole country opposing all puppet organizations and puppet autonomy" and launched a petition march of students from various schools in Peiping to express the people's demands to He Yingqin, a special envoy sent to Peiping by the Nanjing Kuomintang government.

On December 9th, students from major middle schools and universities in Peiping, in the face of the severe winter wind, were in high spirits and extremely angry. However, He Yingqin did not receive them, and the reactionary Kuomintang authorities brutally suppressed the patriotic students. First, they dispersed them with water cannons, then drove them away with broadswords. Students from Tsinghua University, Yenching University, and other schools outside the city were kept outside Xizhimen, enduring cold and hunger for an entire day. Organized and united young students broke through the iron nets, roaring slogans such as "Down with Japanese Imperialism," "Oppose North China Anti-Communist Autonomy," "Armed Defense of North China," and "Stop the Civil War, Unite Against Foreign Enemies."

On the 10th and 11th, various schools jointly held general strikes and organized student unions, held lectures and seminars to discuss current affairs, and organized various propaganda teams to go to the countryside for publicity.

On December 16th, Beijing students held another large-scale demonstration, but were blocked by reactionary military police who opened fire. They then convened a mass meeting of citizens outside Zhengyangmen, proposing not to recognize the "Hebei-Chahar Political Council," to recover the lost territories of the Northeast, and to demand freedom of speech, publication, association, and assembly. After the meeting, the procession marched but was ultimately dispersed by the Kuomintang military police with force. Under the enemy's broadswords and whips, many people were injured and arrested. "December 16th" was the second major demonstration following "December 9th." From then on, students in Peiping and Tianjin, under the call of the Student Union, organized southward expansion propaganda groups to go deep into the people and develop the mass movement.

The "December 9th Movement" resonated in schools and intellectual circles across the country. Students in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Xi'an, Changsha, Jinan, Nanchang, Kaifeng, Chengdu, Taiyuan, and other places held gatherings and demonstrations one after another, promoting the anti-Japanese and national salvation movement of the masses. The "December 9th Movement" marked the arrival of a new high tide in China's anti-Japanese national revolutionary movement.

    “一二·九”运动
    1935年“一二·九”前夕，日本帝国主义对我国的侵略更形加紧，南京国民党政府在订了塘沽、何（应钦）梅（津）两个卖国协定之后，又颁布了所谓“睦邻令”。对一切抗日爱国者都安上了“危害民国”罪，加以打击迫害。这时汉奸到处横行，冀东成立了伪组织，日本宪兵、国民党特务到处捉人。这时，中国共产党发布的《八一宣言》号召全国团结一致抗日，这一主张得到全国人民响应。青年学生义愤填胸，都想挺身出来表示爱国人民的真正心意。11月18日诞生了“北平市学生联合会”，以开展爱国抗日活动，打击汉奸的无耻活动。
    12月3日，学联第三次代表大会决定以行动表示华北青年意志。同日，清华大学第二次全体学生大会通过了“通电全国反对一切伪组织、伪自治”的决议，并发动北平各校同学请愿游行，向南京国民党政府特派来平的何应钦申述人民的要求。
    12月9日，北平各大中学校的学生在严冬的劲风中，精神振奋，愤怒异常。但，何应钦并未接见，国民党反动当局并对爱国学生横施镇压。先以水龙冲散，继以大刀驱赶。城外清华大学、燕京大学等校同学，则一直被拒于西直门外，在冷风中冻饿一整日。组织和团结起来的青年学生们，冲破了铁网，怒吼出“打倒日本帝国主义”，“反对华北防共自治”，“武装保卫华北”，“停止内战，一致对外”等口号。
    10日、11日，各校又联合举行大罢课，并纷纷组织起学生会，开展讲演会，座谈会，讨论时事，组织各种宣传队下乡宣传等。
    12月16日，北京学生又举行大示威，但被反动军警开枪拦阻。便在正阳门外召开市民大会，提出不承认“冀察政务委员会”，收复东北失地，要求言论、出版、结社、集会等自由。会后队伍游行，终被国民党军警以武力驱散。在敌人大刀、皮鞭下，许多人受伤、被捕。“一二·一六”是继“一二·九”之后的第二次大示威。自此以后北平和天津学生又在学联号召下组织南下扩大宣传团深入民间，发展群众运动。
    “一二·九运动”在全国各地学校和知识界引起了回响。上海、广州、武汉、南京、杭州、西安、长沙、济南、南昌、开封、成都、太原等地学生纷纷举行集会和示威游行，推动了人民群众的抗日救国运动。“一二·九运动”标志了中国抗日民族革命的新高潮的到来。
