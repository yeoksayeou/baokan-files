Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, December 12th: Just as French President de Gaulle was on an "inspection" of Algeria, widespread patriotic and just struggles demanding independence and opposing French colonial rule broke out in various parts of Algeria. This struggle is powerfully striking French colonialism, and a panic-stricken de Gaulle has decided to leave Algeria a day early and slink back to Paris on the 13th.

The struggle began on the 9th. To protest the French colonialists' plot to continue maintaining colonial rule over Algeria, Algerian residents in Algiers, Oran, Orleansville, Constantine, and other places have been continuously holding demonstrations for days. Despite the French colonial authorities dispatching large numbers of military police to carry out brutal suppression, the scale of the Algerian people's demonstrations has been growing, and the struggle has become increasingly fierce. In Algiers, following a demonstration of three thousand people on the 10th, another five thousand people demonstrated on the 11th in Algerian residential areas and marched towards the central district of Algiers inhabited by white people. The demonstrators included many workers, women, and young people. They held high the flag of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic and shouted patriotic slogans such as "Long Live the Algerian National Liberation Front," "Abbas in Power," and "Algeria for the Algerians." They received enthusiastic support and cheers from Algerian residents along the way. A leader of the demonstrators, in a statement to reporters, emphasized that Algerians demand freedom. He recalled the massacre of Algerians by French colonialists in 1945 and accused: "We remember that de Gaulle was in power at that time." In Oran and Constantine, thousands upon thousands of Algerian residents held demonstrations for days, shouting anti-French slogans and demanding the realization of Algerian independence.

The French colonial authorities carried out brutal suppression of the demonstrators. On the 10th and 11th, the French colonial authorities mobilized large numbers of paratroopers and police to frantically attack the demonstrating masses in Algiers and Oran, wantonly opening fire on the masses. In self-defense, the demonstrators fought back with wooden sticks, iron bars, and homemade grenades, clashing with paratroopers and local French colonists. According to the French colonial authorities, by the 11th, fifty to sixty Algerians had been massacred, and hundreds more were injured. However, the colonial authorities' ferocity has failed to extinguish the Algerian people's struggle. An Associated Press dispatch on the 11th said that despite French regular troops and paratroopers firing on Algerians, "thousands of Muslims still poured into the streets" of Algiers. A United Press International dispatch said that Algerians armed with iron bars and crowbars clashed with French troops, who opened fire on demonstrators attempting to break through the security line of the government square. "This is the most serious public street fighting in the one hundred and thirty years of French rule in Algeria."

On the 12th, the Algerian people's anti-French struggle continued to surge. In Algiers, more than two thousand five hundred Algerians held demonstrations with sticks. French colonial troops continued to open fire on demonstrators, killing several people and wounding dozens. In Oran, large crowds held a funeral for the four Algerian martyrs killed by French troops on the 11th, and French colonial troops even opened fire on the masses attending the funeral. In self-defense, Algerians bravely fought back against the French colonial troops.

To support the demonstrators, the Algerian working people in Bône have issued a strike call. In Philippeville, Algerian patriots distributed large numbers of leaflets calling on people to mourn the sacrificed martyrs.

On the 11th, the French government had already dispatched six additional paratrooper regiments to Algiers to strengthen the suppression of the demonstrating masses. The French colonial authorities have now blockaded the main roads of Algiers, surrounded Algerian residential areas, and implemented a "curfew." At the same time, de Gaulle hurriedly telephoned French Prime Minister Debré in Paris on the 11th to discuss further ways to suppress the Algerian people's struggle. De Gaulle then announced on the 12th that he would return to France on the 13th.

    阿尔及利亚爆发反法爱国斗争
    示威群众同殖民者发生激烈冲突死伤已达数百人
    法国政府赶派六个伞兵团前往镇压　戴高乐提前结束“巡视”溜回巴黎
    新华社12日讯　阿尔及尔消息：正当法国总统戴高乐在“巡视”阿尔及利亚的时候，阿尔及利亚各地纷纷爆发了要求独立、反对法国殖民统治的规模广泛的爱国正义斗争。这个斗争正有力地打击着法国殖民主义，惊惶失措的戴高乐已经决定提早一天离开阿尔及利亚，在13日就溜回巴黎。
    这个斗争是在9日开始的。为了抗议法国殖民主义者力图继续维持对阿尔及利亚的殖民统治的阴谋，阿尔及尔、奥兰、奥尔良维尔、君士坦丁等地的阿尔及利亚居民连日来不断举行示威游行。尽管法国殖民当局出动大批军警进行残酷的镇压，但是阿尔及利亚人民的示威游行的规模越来越大、斗争越来越激烈。在阿尔及尔，继10日的三千人的示威游行以后，11日又有五千人在阿尔及利亚人集居的地方示威游行，并且开往阿尔及尔白人居住的中心区，示威群众包括许多工人、妇女和青年，他们高举着阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的旗帜，高呼“阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线万岁”、“阿巴斯执政”、“阿尔及利亚人的阿尔及利亚”等爱国口号，他们在沿途受到阿尔及利亚居民的热情的支持和欢呼。示威群众的一个领导人对新闻记者发表谈话时强调说，阿尔及利亚人要求自由。他追述了1945年法国殖民者对阿尔及利亚人的大屠杀，并且指责说：“我们记得，当时正是戴高乐执政的。”在奥兰和君士坦丁等地，成千成百的阿尔及利亚居民连日举行示威，高呼反法口号，要求实现阿尔及利亚的独立。
    法国殖民当局对示威者进行了残酷的镇压。在10日和11日，法国殖民当局纠集了大批伞兵和警察在阿尔及尔和奥兰等地疯狂袭击示威群众，恣意向群众开枪。示威者为了自卫，用木棍、铁棒、土制手榴弹等回击，同伞兵和当地的法国殖民者发生冲突。据法国殖民当局宣布，到11日，已有五、六十名阿尔及利亚人被屠杀，另外数百人被打伤。但是殖民当局的凶焰并没有能够扑灭阿尔及利亚人民的斗争。美联社11日消息说，尽管法国的正规军和伞兵向阿尔及利亚人开枪，阿尔及尔“数以千计的穆斯林人仍然涌到街道上来”。合众国际社消息说，阿尔及利亚人用铁块和铁撬武装起来，同法国军队发生冲突，法国军队向那些企图突破政府广场的警戒线的示威者开枪，“这是法国人统治阿尔及利亚一百三十年中所发生的最严重的公开巷战”。
    在12日，阿尔及利亚人民的反法斗争继续高涨。在阿尔及尔，二千五百多名阿尔及利亚人拿着棒棍举行示威。法国殖民军继续对示威者开枪，杀死了几个人和打伤了数十人。在奥兰，大批群众为11日被法国军队杀害的四名阿尔及利亚烈士举行葬礼，法国殖民军竟对参加葬礼的群众开枪。阿尔及利亚人为了自卫，英勇地对法国殖民军进行了还击。
    为了支持示威者，在波尼的阿尔及利亚劳动人民已经发出了罢工的号召。在菲利普维尔，阿尔及利亚爱国者散发了大批号召人们为牺牲的烈士哀悼的传单。
    法国政府11日已经增派了六个伞兵团到阿尔及尔，以加强对示威群众的镇压。现在法国的殖民当局已封锁了阿尔及尔的主要道路，包围着阿尔及利亚人集居的地区，并且实行“宵禁”。同时，戴高乐已在11日急忙同在巴黎的法国总理德勃雷通电话，讨论进一步镇压阿尔及利亚人民斗争的办法。戴高乐接着在12日宣布，他将在13日返回法国。
