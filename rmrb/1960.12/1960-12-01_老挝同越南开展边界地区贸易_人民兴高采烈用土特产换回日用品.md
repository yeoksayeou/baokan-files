Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 30th. The Pathet Lao Fighting Units radio station broadcast today: According to local news, after learning that the Lao Royal Government and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had reached an agreement on opening trade in the border areas of the two countries, the people in the Lao border areas were extremely excited. They brought goods in droves to the border areas of the two countries to trade with the Vietnamese people.

The radio station said that the people's excitement clearly shows that due to the enemy's economic blockade, the Lao people, especially those in the border areas, have encountered many difficulties in their material lives, particularly a lack of salt and cotton clothing. Now the people are using their local products to exchange for various daily necessities from the Vietnamese side. Therefore, this measure by the government is entirely in line with the wishes of the people.

    老挝同越南开展边界地区贸易
    人民兴高采烈用土特产换回日用品
    新华社河内30日电　寮国战斗部队电台今天广播：据来自地方的消息说，在获悉老挝王国政府同越南民主共和国政府已经达成了关于开放两国边界地区贸易的协议之后，老挝边界地区的人民群众感到无比兴奋，他们成群结队地把货物挑到两国交界地区，同越南人民群众进行交易。
    这家电台说，人民群众的兴奋情绪使人们清楚地看出，由于敌人的经济封锁，老挝人民、特别是边界地区的人民在物质生活方面遇到许多困难，特别是缺乏食盐和棉衣。现在人民群众用他们的土特产从越南方面换回各种日用必需品。因此，政府这项措施是完全符合人民群众的愿望的。
