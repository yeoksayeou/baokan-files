    Directing Production with Correct Methods
    Long Cun
    Our rural Party organizations at all levels, and every cadre of the rural people's communes, must lead agricultural production effectively and learn to direct production with correct methods.
    How can we achieve correct direction of production? First, we must consciously pay attention to grasping the characteristics of agricultural production. There are many characteristics of agricultural production. Here, I will try to list a few of the main points.
    First, crops are living organisms, things that have life, and are constantly developing and changing; crop varieties are complex, each with its own inherent growth laws, regional adaptability, planting season, fertilizer requirements, moisture, management techniques, and maturity period, and people cannot violate these at will. It is common knowledge that rice cannot be planted in winter and cotton cannot be planted in autumn. Even if planting is basically according to the season, there is a big difference between early and late planting. To direct production, we must grasp these characteristics, pay attention to the seasons, and not violate the farming season, and only by following the growth laws of different crops can we do a good job in production.
    Second, agricultural production is largely subject to natural conditions. Now and for a considerable period to come, people cannot completely overcome natural disasters, and can only try to resist, avoid, and reduce the losses caused by natural disasters. Natural disasters such as typhoons, rainstorms, droughts, floods, and pests will all affect crop growth. When directing production, we must fully estimate this factor in advance, pay attention to the climate, and take active measures to minimize or avoid these adverse effects.
    Third, there are vast differences between agricultural production areas. The temperature, annual rainfall, and frost-free period are not exactly the same in all regions. The soil types include clay, sandy soil, sandy loam, and saline-alkali soil. The terrain includes hills, plains, and low-lying areas. Population density varies, with different amounts of land per capita; water conservancy conditions are good or bad; fertilizer sources are abundant or scarce; the number of draft animals and farm tools varies; and the management skills of the masses also vary. These characteristics determine the complexity of area layout, variety arrangement, crop rotation, and technical guidance, and the necessity of adapting to local conditions and the time. When directing production, we must grasp the characteristics of vast differences and complex situations between regions, implement planting according to local conditions, implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture according to local conditions, and arrange farm work according to local conditions.
    What is said here are general characteristics. Each region, each commune, brigade, and team must study the specific characteristics of their own area in order to ensure that their direction of production is in line with objective reality. Especially in terms of production system reform, promotion of advanced experiences, formulation of production increase measures, and arrangement of various farm tasks, it is even more important to conform to the specific characteristics of local agricultural production at the time in order to proceed from reality, achieve the desired results, and do a good job in production.
    To correctly direct production, in addition to grasping the characteristics of agricultural production, we must also pay attention to the characteristics of the current production relations of the people's communes. The rural people's communes at the current stage adhere to the principle of "three-level ownership, with the team as the foundation, unified leadership, and decentralized management." The production brigade is the foundation of the people's commune, and the power of production, operation, and management should mainly belong to the production brigade. This is an important aspect of strengthening the basic ownership of the production brigade at the present stage. When leading and directing production, leading cadres of our counties or communes must pay attention to this characteristic. This certainly does not mean abandoning leadership, abandoning the supervision and inspection of production brigades, and ensuring the implementation of production plans, but rather reminding us to lead better. For example, the production plan of the commune should be based on the production plans of the production brigades and teams, and should not be subjectively formulated. Issues such as output targets, area planning, variety arrangement, and technical measures should all be a combination of top-down proposals and bottom-up discussions and revisions, and should allow a certain degree of flexibility to the lower levels. For example, for a production team, under the unified leadership of the brigade, and on the premise of ensuring the completion of production tasks, it has the right to plant according to local conditions, to formulate technical measures, and to arrange various farm tasks. When directing the production of teams, we must not affect their exercise of these rights.
    Both unified leadership and giving flexibility to the lower levels is a major characteristic of leading agricultural production. This characteristic reflects the fact that agricultural production varies greatly in terms of region, crops, and natural conditions. The production plans, targets, and measures determined by the leadership cannot fully take into account all the different situations. Therefore, it is necessary to leave room for maneuver and let the lower levels implement them according to local conditions in accordance with the unified plan. Some of our comrades tend to emphasize specificity and do not pay attention to giving the lower levels a certain degree of flexibility, as if they have already been so specific that the lower levels do not need to be specific anymore. This is not right. In any work we do, under the guidance of principles, we should strive for specificity, but specificity is not the same as absolutism. The very specific opinions of the higher-level organization still need to be further specified when they reach the lower-level organization and are put into practical action. If we do not give the lower levels flexibility, it would seem that we have completely understood everything about agricultural production, so we do not need to let the lower levels study and handle matters according to their own characteristics. This is obviously an incorrect idea. We advocate giving flexibility to the lower levels under unified leadership, leaving room for maneuver, which means that we estimate that there are insufficient aspects in the complex and changeable situation of agricultural production. Therefore, we advocate that the leadership should be specific in production, not only should the higher levels be specific, but the lower levels should also be specific. Issues of principle must be implemented resolutely and without compromise; specific issues must be used to inspire and guide the lower levels to adapt to the time, place, and circumstances, use their brains more, and think of more ways to ensure that the principles stipulated by the higher levels are better realized. That is to say, the specificity in our command of production is by no means to hold the lower levels so tightly that they cannot move, negating the specificity of the lower levels, and turning leadership into paternalism, affecting the initiative and enthusiasm of the lower levels. It should be understood that principles must not be discounted in the slightest, the concretization of principles is not absolutization, grasping tightly is not grasping to death, and leadership is not paternalism. These all relate to the issue of ideological methods.
    To correctly direct production, we need correct ideological methods as guidance. Let's give two examples. For example, the issue of points and areas. It is right for our commune cadres to pay attention to grasping points; however, we must also realize that the situation of the points cannot fully represent the situation of the areas. Agricultural production is complex and changeable, and is greatly restricted by regional and natural conditions. For example, during summer field management, if insect pests are found at some points, it does not mean that there are insect pests in other places; if weeds are serious at some points, it does not mean that there are weeds in other places. Therefore, we cannot simply infer the situation of the areas from the situation of the points. This requires us to understand the situation of the areas after deeply understanding the situation of the points. It is impossible to simply infer the situation of the areas by only understanding the points. To use the experience of the points to guide the work of the areas, we must also pay attention to the representativeness of the points, and pay attention to comparing the conditions of the points and the conditions of the areas. We cannot simply copy the experience of the points to the areas. The areas also have various different situations. Therefore, when using points to lead the areas, we must also find out the situation of various different types of points, understand the problems of the areas, and use multiple points to guide the areas. After the experience of the points is grasped, it must be specifically analyzed when it is used in similar areas: which are suitable for use in the areas; which are not suitable for use in the areas; which the points do not have but the areas have; and so on. In this way, we can better exert the role of using points to lead the areas.
    Another example is the issue of reform and inheritance of the farming system. Rationally reforming the farming system and actively promoting advanced experience are important measures for increasing agricultural production. However, agricultural production is a science, and it must be treated with a scientific and specific analytical attitude. For the farming systems and production experiences left by our ancestors, the good and reasonable ones should be inherited and carried forward, and the unreasonable, outdated, and backward ones should be rationally reformed in a step-by-step manner, and should never be crudely and completely negated. When reforming, we must specifically analyze the local conditions of soil, water conservancy, fertilizer, labor, animal power, tools, and mass experience. Whenever the conditions are not yet available, we must first actively change and create conditions and conduct experiments. Only when the main conditions have been basically met and the experiments have been successful can we gradually promote them from points to areas, from less to more. Only in this way can reform truly achieve the purpose of being conducive to production development, conducive to socialist construction, and conducive to improving people's lives. We must reform while inheriting, reform when it is beneficial, and not reform when it is not beneficial. We must also pay attention to whether it meets the needs of the masses. We will reform if the masses are willing to reform, and we will not reform temporarily if they are unwilling. We can only wait patiently and use facts to persuade them, and we must not act recklessly.
    These are just two examples we have given. There are many similar examples in actual work, which all need to be specifically analyzed, and the experiences and lessons of the past few years should be summarized and compared with many different situations in order to improve our level of understanding.
    Whether or not we can correctly lead production and direct production, the most fundamental issue is to have a highly caring attitude towards the interests of the masses. Whether production is done well or not is directly related to the great cause of national construction, people's lives, and the consolidation and development of the people's communes. Therefore, we must have a high sense of responsibility to the Party and the people, and when directing production and when formulating and implementing every production increase measure, we must first consider the interests of the masses, pay attention to practical results, and resolutely oppose any individualistic ideas in directing production.

    用正确的方法指挥生产
    龙邨
    我们农村各级党组织，农村人民公社的每个干部，都要很好地领导农业生产，学会用正确的方法指挥生产。
    怎样才能做到正确的指挥生产呢？首先是要自觉地注意掌握农业生产的特点。农业生产的特点是很多的，这里试举主要的几点来说一说。
    第一，农作物是活的生物，是有生命的东西，会不断发展变化的；农作物的品种复杂，各有其自己固有的生长规律，地区的适应性、播种的季节、需肥量、水分、管理技术、成熟期也不一，人们不能随便违反它。冬天不能栽水稻，秋天不能种棉花，这是人皆尽知的。即使是基本按季节播种，早种迟种也大有区别。指挥生产要掌握这类特点，要注意季节，不违农时，根据不同作物的生长规律，才能把生产搞好。
    第二，农业生产在很大程度上受自然条件的支配。现在乃至今后相当长的一个时期，人还不能完全战胜自然灾害，只能尽力抗御、避免和减少自然灾害带来的损失。台风、暴雨、旱涝、病虫害等自然灾害，都会影响农作物的生长。我们指挥生产事先要充分估计到这个因素，注意气候，积极采取措施，尽可能减少或避免这种不利的影响。
    第三，农业生产地区之间的千差万别，气温高低、常年雨量多少、无霜期长短各地都不完全一样，土质有粘土、沙土、沙壤土、盐碱土等等，地势有丘陵、有平原、有洼地；人口密度有大有小，平均占有土地有多有少；水利条件有好有坏；肥源有丰有枯；耕畜农具占有数量有多有少；群众的管理技术水平也有高低之分，这些特点，就决定了面积布局、品种安排、茬口搭配、技术指导上的复杂性和因时因地制宜的必要性。我们指挥生产一定要掌握地区之间千差万别和情况复杂的特点，要根据不同的地区实行因地种植，因地制宜地贯彻农业“八字宪法”，因地制宜地安排农活。
    这里讲的还是一般的特点，每个地区，每个公社、大队和小队都要研究自己那里的具体特点，才能做到自己对生产的指挥，符合客观实际。特别是有关生产改制，推广先进经验，制订增产措施，安排各种农活等方面，更要符合当时当地农业生产的具体特点，才能做到从实际出发，达到预期的效果，把生产搞好。
    要正确指挥生产，除了要掌握农业生产的特点之外，还要注意当前人民公社生产关系的特点。农村人民公社在目前阶段是坚持执行“三级所有，队为基础，统一领导，分级管理”的原则。生产大队是人民公社的基础，生产经营管理的权力，应该主要归生产大队。这是现阶段加强生产大队的基本所有制的一个重要方面。我们县或公社的领导干部，在领导和指挥生产时，千万要注意这个特点。这当然决不是放弃领导，放弃对生产大队的督促检查工作和保证生产计划的执行，而是提醒我们要领导得更好。比如，公社的生产计划，应该建立在生产大队和小队生产计划的基础上，不能主观制定。对于产量指标、面积规划、品种安排、技术措施等都应该上下结合，由上而下的提出方案，由下而上的讨论修订，并给下面一定的机动余地。又比如，就一个生产小队来说，在大队统一领导下，在保证完成生产任务的前提下，有权因地种植，有权制定技术措施，有权安排各种农活。我们在指挥小队生产时，就不能影响他们执行这些权利。
    既要统一领导，又要给下面机动权，这是领导农业生产一个很大的特色。这个特色，就是反映了农业生产的地区、作物、自然条件等是千差万别的。领导上确定的生产计划、指标、措施等，不可能完全照顾到各种不同的情况，因此，需要留有余地，让下面根据统一计划，因地贯彻执行。我们有些同志，往往强调要具体，就不注意给下面一定的机动，好像自己已经具体得不必下面再去具体了，这是不对的。我们做任何工作，在原则的指导下，都应该力求具体化，但是具体化并不等于绝对化。上一级组织已经很具体的意见，到了下一级组织，到了实际行动中，还需要进一步具体化。如果不给下面机动权，这从认识上来说，就好像自己把农业生产上的一切东西都认识完了，所以才不必让下面再去研究并按照他们自己的特点去办事。这显然是一种不正确的想法。我们提倡在统一领导下，给下面机动权，留有余地，就表示我们对农业生产复杂多变的情况有估计不足之处，所以，我们提倡领导生产具体化，不只是上面要具体化，下面也要具体化。原则的问题，要一步不让，不折不扣地贯彻执行；具体的问题，要启发、引导下面因时因地因事制宜，多动脑筋，多想办法，保证更好地实现上级规定的原则。这也就是说，我们在指挥生产上的具体，决不等于什么问题都把下面卡得死死的，否定了下面的具体，把领导变成包办代替，影响到下面的主动性和积极性的发挥。应该懂得：原则一定丝毫不能打折扣，原则的具体化又不是绝对化，抓紧也不是抓死，领导并不是包办。这些，都关系到思想方法问题。
    要正确指挥生产，需要有正确的思想方法作指导。我们举两个例子来说。例如，点和面的问题。我们公社干部，注意抓点，这是对的；但是，点的情况，并不能完全代表面的情况，这一点也要想到。农业生产复杂多变，受地域性和自然条件的限制很大。比如在夏季田间管理时，发现点上有虫害，但其他地方不一定都有虫害；点上草荒严重，但其他地方不一定有草荒。所以不能简单地拿点的情况推论面的情况。这就要求我们在农业生产上，在深入了解点的情况以后，还要了解面的情况，只了解点，不了解面，是不能简单地以点推论面的。要用点的经验来指导面的工作，更要注意点的代表性，注意比较点的条件和面的条件，也不能简单地把点的经验照搬到面。面也有各种不同的情况，所以，在以点带面的时候，还要摸清各种不同类型的点的情况，了解面的问题，做到以多点来指导面。点上的经验抓到后，用到同类地区的面上时，还要具体分析，那些适合面上用的；那些面上不适合的；那些是点上还没有的而面上有的；等等。这样，才能更好地发挥以点带面的作用。
    又如，耕作制度上的改革和继承问题。合理改革耕作制度，积极推广先进经验，这是农业增产的重要措施。但是农业生产是一门科学，必须用科学的、具体分析的态度去对待它。对老祖宗遗留下来的耕作制度和生产经验，好的、合理的东西，应该继承和发扬，不合理的、过时的、落后的东西，应该有步骤地合理改革，决不能粗暴地一概否定。在改革时，要具体分析当地的土壤、水利、肥料、劳力、畜力、工具、群众经验等条件，凡条件还不具备的时候，要首先积极地改变和创造条件，进行试验，当主要条件已经基本具备、试验已经成功以后，才能由点到面，由少到多，逐步推行。这样改革，才能真正达到有利生产发展，有利社会主义建设，有利于改善人民生活的目的。我们要边改革，边继承，有利则改，无利不改，而且还要注意是否适合群众的需要，群众愿意则改，不愿意暂时不改，只有耐心等待，拿事实来说服，不能蛮干。
    这仅是我们举的两个例子。类似上述事例在实际工作中还很多，都需要具体分析，而且要总结几年来的经验教训，将许多不相同的情况进行比较，以便提高自己的认识水平。
    能否正确地领导生产，指挥生产，最根本的问题是要有高度关心群众利益的观点。生产搞得好与不好，是直接关系到国家建设、人民生活和人民公社巩固发展的大事。因此我们对党对人民要有高度的责任感，在指挥生产的时候，在制订和贯彻每一项增产措施的时候，都首先要考虑群众的利益，要讲究实际效果，坚决反对在指挥生产上的任何个人主义思想。
