    Determined to Turn Poor Mountains into Rich Mountains
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Bi Yuehua, Yue Xi
      "The mountain pressing on our heads has been overturned, the iron chain locked around our necks has been broken, the poisonous snake缠绕 around our bodies has been eliminated. The Communist Party's sun of happiness shines on us forever." The emancipated peasants of Wusijiang Township, Mozhugongka County, in the Gongbu Bala Mountains east of Lhasa, used self-composed folk songs to praise the changes in their hometown over the past year.
    Wusijiang Township, located in the Gongbu Bala Mountains, is over 4,000 meters above sea level. The terrain here is high and cold, with wind and sand obscuring the sky. There are six months of freezing every year, and the frost-free period is very short. Agricultural crops are reduced in yield almost every year due to hail and frost. Each "ke" of land (approximately equivalent to one mu) can only produce dozens of jin of grain, and some even fail to recover the seeds. Only a few of the thirty-odd households living here can eat zanba on a regular basis.
    In November of last year, the democratic reform of Wusijiang Township ended. Tibetan peasants shattered the feudal serf system, distributed land, houses, livestock, and farm tools, and, under the leadership of the Party, organized agricultural production mutual aid teams. In just over a year, they have transformed the mountain area, which had been regarded as "poor mountains and bad waters" for thousands of years, from a grain-deficient township into a surplus grain township. This year, the average yield per ke of land in the township reached more than 240 jin, and the total output increased by more than two times compared with last year. The average income of each of the 133 people in the township was 801 jin of grain, and every household increased their income.
    Wusijiang Township originally had more than 400 ke of cultivated land, but in the past, only more than 150 ke were planted each year, and more than 300 ke of land were left fallow or barren year-round. After the democratic reform, the emancipated peasants were determined to plant all the original cultivated land with crops to increase grain production. They divided the labor force of the mutual aid teams into strong, medium, and weak categories. The strong laborers reclaimed wasteland and plowed the land, the medium laborers accumulated and transported fertilizer, and the weak laborers picked stones and grass roots. Without plowing cattle, they trained yaks to plow the land; lacking farm tools, they invited blacksmiths from neighboring townships to improve all 28 Tibetan plows in the township. In one winter, the peasants of the township plowed more than 300 ke of fallow land and reclaimed wasteland.
    While winter plowing was underway, fertilizer accumulation was also in full swing. In the past, very little fertilizer was applied to the land here. After the democratic reform, the emancipated peasants broke the superstitions that "digging mud ponds will cause sores on the feet" and "burning bone ash will offend the gods." Each mutual aid team cleared out the feces and garbage accumulated for many years in front of and behind their houses, in the village, and by the roadside. In the cold winter months, the manure piles froze like stones. The peasants went to the mountains to cut thorny grass, used a large fire to bake it, and then dug it out and transported it to the fields. In order to prepare enough fertilizer for the crops, Danba Ciren, the director of the township farmers' association, and four young people braved the biting cold wind and climbed steep rock cliffs. Finally, they found a thick layer of bird droppings in a cave on a mountaintop. They left early and returned late, and it took them three days to transport all the bird droppings back. After a winter and spring of hard work, the peasants fertilized an average of 12,200 jin per ke of land in the township this year.
    The fields in Wusijiang Township are mostly on the mountainside and are dry year-round. In the past, the serf owners had forced the serfs to dig a canal, but they were not allowed to use it. Some serfs rose up in resistance, but those who resisted were killed. From then on, the serfs no longer repaired the canals, and every spring, they sowed seeds and waited for the rainy season to come. Now, the emancipated peasants, who have become the masters of the land, under the leadership of the township farmers' association and the mutual aid teams, have organized a water conservancy army, found a valley on the mountainside, and are determined to open a canal here to divert the spring water flowing from the mountaintop to the terraced fields on the slopes.
    In February, the Gongbu Bala Mountains were freezing cold, and ice blocks frozen like stones covered the entire earth. There were many difficulties in opening a canal on the ice, but the difficulties did not scare the emancipated peasants of Wusijiang Township. The peasants who had participated in the construction of the Kangzang Highway proposed to use the spirit of the People's Liberation Army in opening mountains and building roads to repair the canal. They used axes to split off the surface ice, and then used pickaxes to break open the frozen soil. After more than 20 days of struggle, they finally uncovered the frozen soil of the ice layer on the mountainside and built seven canals with a total length of 1,200 meters and two reservoirs, turning 180 ke of dry land into irrigated land.
    On the principle of doing a good job in grain production, vigorously developing sideline production and implementing diversified management have increased the income of the people of Wusijiang Township. While concentrating the main labor force on production, they organized the old and weak labor force to weave baskets. There are many wild animals in the Gongbu Bala Mountains, and there is also a lot of firewood. The township farmers' association also organized hunting teams and firewood chopping teams to brave the wind and snow to hunt and chop firewood in the mountains. In this way, they overcame the difficulties, won a great autumn harvest this year, and increased their income.

    定把穷山变富山
    新华社记者　毕月华　悦西
      “压在头上的大山推翻了，锁在颈上的铁链斩断了，缠在身上的毒蛇消灭了，共产党的幸福太阳，永远照在我们身上。”拉萨以东工布巴拉山区墨竹工卡县乌斯江乡的翻身农民，用自编的山歌来歌颂家乡一年来的变化。
    处在工布巴拉山区的乌斯江乡，拔海在四千米以上。这里地势高寒，风沙蔽天，每年结冰时期有六个月，无霜期很短，农作物几乎年年因雹灾和霜打而减产，每克地（约相当于一亩）只能产几十斤粮食，有的甚至连种子也收不回来，居住在这里的三十多户人家，只有几户能够比较经常地吃上糌粑。
    去年11月，乌斯江乡的民主改革结束了，藏族农民们粉碎了封建农奴制度，分得了土地、房屋、牲畜和农具，在党的领导下，组织起农业生产互助组，在短短的一年多时间里，使千百年来被认为“穷山恶水”的山区，开始由缺粮乡变成了余粮乡。今年全乡平均每克地单位面积产量达到二百四十多斤，总产量比去年增加两倍多，全乡一百三十三人，平均每人收入粮食八百零一斤，家家户户都增加了收入。
    乌斯江乡原有四百多克耕地，但过去每年只种一百五十多克，有三百多克土地常年轮休或荒芜。民主改革以后，翻身农民决心把原有的耕地全部种上庄稼，增加粮食产量。他们把互助组的劳动力分成强、中、弱三等，强劳动力开荒犁地，中等劳动力积肥运肥，弱劳动力拣石子、草根。没有耕牛，他们就训练牦牛来耕地；缺乏农具，他们就从邻乡请来了铁木工人，将全乡二十八具藏犁全部进行了改良。一个冬天，全乡农民翻犁轮休地和开垦荒地三百多克。
    在冬耕的同时，积肥也在热烈地进行。过去这里的土地很少施肥。民主改革以后，翻身农民破除了“挖泥塘脚上要生疮”、“烧骨灰会触犯神灵”的迷信，各互助组把屋前屋后、村里和路边多年积存的粪便、垃圾都清理出来。寒冬腊月，粪堆冻得像石头一样，农民们便到山上割下刺草，用大火来烤，然后挖出运到地里。为了给庄稼准备足够的肥料，乡农会主任丹巴次仁和四个青年，冒着刺骨的寒风，攀登陡峭的石岩，终于在一处山顶的岩洞里找到了铺得厚厚的一层鸟粪。他们早出晚归，用了三天时间，才把鸟粪全部运回来。农民们经过一冬一春的苦战，使今年全乡每克土地平均施肥一万二千二百斤。
    乌斯江乡的田地多在半山腰，常年干旱，过去农奴主曾经强迫农奴开过一条渠，但不准农奴们使用。有的农奴起来反抗，但反抗的人都被杀害了。从此，农奴们再也不修水渠，每年春天播下种子，就等待着雨季来临。现在成了土地主人的翻身农民，在乡农民协会和互助组的领导下，组织起一支水利大军，在半山腰找到一处山谷，决心在这里辟山开渠，把山顶流下的泉水引向坡上坡下的梯田。
    2月里，工布巴拉山区滴水成冰，冻得像石头一样的冰块复盖了整个大地。在冰块上开渠困难很多，但困难吓不到乌斯江乡的翻身农民，曾经参加过修筑康藏公路的农民提出，要用解放军辟山开路的精神来修水渠。他们用斧头劈掉表层的冰块，然后再用十字镐敲开冻土。经过二十多天的奋斗，终于揭开了半山腰的冰层冻土，修起了总长一千二百米的七条水渠和两个蓄水塘，使一百八十克干旱的土地变成了水浇地。
    在搞好粮食生产的原则下，大搞副业生产、实行多种经营，使乌斯江乡人民增加了收入。他们在把主要劳动力集中到生产上的同时，把老弱劳动力组织起来编筐。工布巴拉山一带各种野兽很多，柴禾也不少，乡农民协会又组织起打猎队和砍柴队，冒着风雪上山打猎、砍柴。就这样，他们克服了困难，夺得了今年秋季大丰收，增加了收入。
