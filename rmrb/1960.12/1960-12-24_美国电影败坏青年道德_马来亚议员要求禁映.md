Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd, Kuala Lumpur News: Malayan parliamentarians are demanding that the government ban American films that corrupt the morals of young people from being shown in Malaya.

    Kanan Singh, a parliamentarian from the People's Socialist Front of Malaya, said in the Lower House on the 20th that in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, and other major cities, all that people see are American films that promote violence, robbery, murder, and pornography. These films corrupt the morals of Malayan youth, teach them criminal tricks, and increase social unrest. He also accused some American films of glorifying white supremacy and the brutal killing of Indians, etc. He said that locally produced films in Malaya are also deeply influenced by American films. Kanan Singh called on the government to ban the import of the aforementioned films.

    Some parliamentarians from the Pan-Malayan Islamic Party also expressed deep dissatisfaction with the practice of some American films frequently insulting the founder of Islam and distorting Islamic doctrines. They demanded that the government ban such films from being shown in Malaya.
