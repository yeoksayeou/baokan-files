    Using the Method of Concentrating Superior Forces to Fight Annihilation Battles
    Shanghai's Steel Front Achieves Sustained High Production
    Under the Unified Command of the Municipal Party Committee, All Districts and Specialized Bureaus Are Linked at All Levels, Working Extensively Together to Support Increased Steel Production
    (Our dispatch from Shanghai, December 3rd) Shanghai's steel production has seen a continuous growth trend for several months, with production rising sharply. This is the result of Shanghai, encouraged by the excellent situation nationwide and with the vigorous support of various regions, fully developing the experience of the mass movement with steel as the key link over the past two years, and implementing the principle of concentrating forces to guarantee key points. It is also a major victory achieved on the economic front by studying and applying Comrade Mao Zedong's guiding ideology of concentrating superior forces to fight annihilation battles.
    This year, the Shanghai steel front faced the situation of heavy tasks, a large increase in steel production, high quality requirements, and relatively high sulfur content in some pig iron, which brought a series of new problems to production. Faced with these situations, the broad masses of workers and staff on the Shanghai steel front continued to carry forward the spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win. On the one hand, they besieged the various key technical operations caused by the implementation of alkaline operation in the iron-smelting furnaces; on the other hand, under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, they mobilized the forces of the city's machinery and electrical industry, transportation, material supply, commerce, scientific research, and other fields to support the front line of steel production, so that many key production technology problems were quickly resolved one by one.
    Unify Thought, Unify Action
    Overall Planning, Extensive Collaboration
    Shanghai's specific approach to concentrating forces to fight annihilation battles is: under the direct leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, establish a strong unified command, concentrate leadership, make overall arrangements, unify thinking, and unify action. Responsible comrades of the Municipal Party Committee regularly hold meetings to analyze the production situation at each stage and go deep into the production front line to study and solve problems on the spot. Each district and specialized bureau established offices and groups to support steel production, linking up and down, left and right, forming an extremely broad collaborative network throughout the city to assist steel plants in solving problems. While organizing forces from all aspects to support steel production, they also closely integrated with tasks, continuously strengthened political and ideological work, and greatly stimulated the consciousness of the broad masses of cadres and the masses to obey the overall situation and ensure key points. In supporting steel production, they also comprehensively arranged the production work of other industrial sectors, ensuring the continuous leap forward in all aspects.
    Manpower and Materials Concentrated on the Front Line
      Production Key Points Broken Through One After Another
    Since the beginning of this year, every major key point in Shanghai's steel production has been resolved by concentrating manpower and material resources under the unified organization of the steelmaking command. The continuous increase in converter steel production is the key to the continued growth of the city's steel production this year; and the realization of new technical routes for iron-smelting furnaces in converter workshops to improve desulfurization effects and pig iron production is the key to increasing converter production. In order to overcome this major key point, cadres and technical forces from all major steel plants in the city were concentrated on the iron-smelting furnaces, fully besieging the operating technical barriers of alkaline iron-smelting furnaces. In the hot summer, the Shanghai steel front launched a mass movement to fight high temperatures, attack high sulfur, and seize high yields. Responsible cadres of the Municipal Party Committee, District Party Committee, and the Metallurgical Bureau also went deep into the No. 1 iron-smelting furnace of the No. 2 converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 to work alongside workers, and as a result, quickly broke through the technical key points of large-scale alkaline iron-smelting furnaces, explored a set of operating techniques for alkaline iron-smelting furnaces and the experience of "politics on the furnace front." The hourly iron smelting rate of the No. 1 iron-smelting furnace increased from 10 tons to more than 18 tons, creating the highest record of smelting rate for large-scale alkaline iron-smelting furnaces in the country. Subsequently, under the organization of the leadership departments, steel plants across the city concentrated their efforts to promote the experience of No. 1 furnace, and in a very short period of time, the smelting rate of iron-smelting furnaces in converter workshops of steel plants across the city generally increased by 70% to 80%. Afterwards, the steel plants made persistent efforts to continue to concentrate their forces on seizing the furnace opening rate of iron-smelting furnaces, so that the furnace opening rate increased from about 60% to more than 70%, providing more iron for converters. After the furnace opening rate of iron-smelting furnaces increased, how to reduce iron consumption in converters became a new key point for each plant to increase steel production. Aiming at this key point, the masses were recently mobilized to fully besiege it, and the iron consumption in many converter workshops has been reduced compared with the past. Under the slogan of "everything for the furnace front," all fronts within the steel plant also concentrated their efforts to ensure the front line.
    In order to assist steel plants to quickly realize the technical transformation of iron-smelting furnaces, the Municipal Steelmaking Command organized more than 200 factories to rush-produce a large number of blowers, hot-blast stoves, and other equipment needed for alkaline iron-smelting furnaces for steel plants. After the iron-smelting furnace adopted alkaline, hot-blast, and large-wind new technologies, the transportation tasks of raw materials and steel slag increased greatly. The steelmaking command also organized forces from all aspects of the city to rush-produce a batch of transportation and lifting equipment for steel plants, coupled with the development of large-scale cooperation between material and transportation departments, the transportation efficiency was greatly improved, and the transportation of steel raw materials was accelerated. Due to the realization of the technical transformation of iron-smelting furnaces and the improvement of desulfurization efficiency, the consumption of auxiliary materials increased greatly. At this time, the steelmaking command, together with the Municipal Raw Materials Command, held a series of special meetings, organizing more than 100 factories producing auxiliary materials to tap production potential and increase the production of oxygen, lime, silicon iron, refractory materials, and other auxiliary materials, ensuring the needs of steel plants in a timely manner. The Municipal First Commercial Bureau also set up working groups in key steel plants, and the 11 purchasing and supply stations and professional companies under it also sent resident factory staff to provide door-to-door services. Whatever materials are needed for maintenance equipment by the steel plant, they will support whatever materials are needed; whenever the factory needs it, it will be delivered.
      Grasp Ideological Work with One Hand
      Grasp the Completion of Tasks with the Other
    Due to unified leadership, concentrated forces, and extensive collaboration, the tasks of supporting steel by various departments were completed very quickly and in a timely manner, enabling steel plants to gain the initiative and win time in the battle for steel.
    In concentrating forces to fight for steel, Shanghai's relevant leadership departments adopted the approach of grasping ideology with one hand and grasping tasks with the other, using grasping ideology to drive tasks, so the consciousness of the broad masses of cadres and the masses to obey the overall situation and ensure key points was greatly improved. There is a solid ideological foundation for completing tasks. In arranging production tasks, every factory and enterprise put tasks related to steel production in the first place, "opening green lights all the way." Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 urgently needed a 75-ton crane, and more than 20 factories, including Shanghai Lifting and Transportation Machinery Factory, accepted the task. Tasks that used to take more than six months to complete were completed in more than 40 days this time.
    Guarantee Key Points, Promote the General
    The mass movement with steel as the key link has also vigorously promoted the movement of increasing production and practicing economy in other industrial sectors. Under the unified leadership and comprehensive arrangement of the Municipal Party Committee, key points were guaranteed and the general was promoted. The city's machinery factories adopted a large-scale cooperation method, dividing up and undertaking a batch of urgent manufacturing tasks of metallurgical equipment. These tasks were urgent and demanding, but they were divided into parts and assigned to various factories, which not only completed them quickly, but also promoted the further improvement of the entire enterprise's production, technology, and management level, and also played a promoting role in the production of other products.
    Now, a new upsurge is being set off on the Shanghai steel front. The broad masses of workers and staff are continuing to use the experience of concentrating forces to fight annihilation battles, making persistent efforts to win a complete victory in this year's steel production.

    运用集中优势兵力打歼灭战的方法
    上海钢铁战线持续高产
    在市委统一指挥下各区各专业局上下左右层层挂钩，广泛协作，支援增产钢铁
    本报上海3日电　上海钢铁生  产连续几个月出现持续增长的局面，生产直线上升。这是上海市在全国大好形势鼓舞下和各地大力支援下，充分发扬两年来以钢为纲大搞群众运动的经验，贯彻集中力量保证重点的方针的结果。这也是在经济战线上学习和运用毛泽东同志集中优势兵力打歼灭战这一指导思想所取得的重大胜利。
    上海钢铁战线今年面临的形势是：任务重，钢产量增长幅度大，质量要求高，而部分生铁的含硫比较高，这就给生产带来了一系列的新问题。面对这些情况，上海钢铁战线上的广大职工继续发扬敢于斗争、敢于胜利的精神，一方面围攻因化铁炉实行碱性操作所引起的各个技术操作关键；另一方面在市委领导下，调动了全市机电工业、交通运输、物资供应、商业、科学研究等各个方面的力量，支援钢铁生产第一线，使许多生产技术上的关键问题，逐个地迅速得到解决。
    统一思想　统一行动
    统筹安排　广泛协作
    上海集中力量打歼灭战的具体做法是：在市委直接领导下，建立强有力的统一指挥部，集中领导，统筹安排，统一思想，统一行动。市委负责同志经常召开会议，分析每一阶段的生产形势，并深入到生产第一线，现场研究和解决问题。各区、各专业局分别建立支援钢铁生产的办公室和小组，上下左右，层层挂钩，在全市范围内形成了一个极为广泛的协作网，协助钢厂解决问题。而在组织各方面的力量支援钢铁生产的同时，还紧密结合任务，不断加强政治思想工作，大大激发广大干部和群众服从全局、保证重点的自觉性。在支援钢铁生产中，还全面安排了其他工业部门的生产工作，保证了各方面的不断跃进。
    人力物力集中第一线
      生产关键纷纷突破
    今年以来，上海钢铁生产的每一个重大关键，都是在炼钢指挥部的统一组织下，集中人力物力解决的。转炉钢产量的不断提高，是全市钢产量今年继续增长的关键；而转炉车间的化铁炉实现新的技术路线，以提高去硫效果和铁水产量，又是转炉增产的关键。为了攻克这一重大关键，全市各大型钢铁厂的干部和技术力量都集中到化铁炉上，全力围攻碱性化铁炉的操作技术关。在炎热的夏季，全市钢铁战线掀起了战高温、攻高硫、夺高产的群众运动高潮。市委、区委以及冶金局等部门的负责干部，还深入上钢三厂第二转炉车间一号化铁炉上，和工人一起劳动，结果很快突破了大型碱性、化铁炉的技术关键，摸索出一套碱性化铁炉的操作技术和“政治上炉前”的经验。一号化铁炉每小时的铁水熔化率，由十吨提高到十八吨以上，创造了全国大型碱性化铁炉熔化率的最高纪录。接着，全市各钢厂在领导部门的组织下，又集中力量推广一号炉的经验，在很短时间内就使全市各钢厂转炉车间的化铁炉熔化率普遍提高70％到80％。接着，各钢厂再接再厉，继续集中力量大抓化铁炉的开炉率，使开炉率从原来的60％左右提高到70％以上，给转炉提供了更多的铁水。化铁炉开炉率提高以后，转炉如何降低铁耗，又成为各厂提高钢产量的一个新关键，针对这个关键，最近又发动群众全力围攻，不少转炉车间的铁耗比过去有了降低。在“一切为了炉前”的口号下，钢厂内部各条战线也都集中力量保证第一线。
    为了协助钢厂迅速实现化铁炉的技术改造任务，市炼钢指挥部组织了两百多家工厂，为钢厂赶制了大批鼓风机、热风炉以及碱性化铁炉所需要的其他设备。化铁炉采用了碱性、热风、大风新技术以后，原料、钢渣的运输任务大大增加。炼钢指挥部又组织全市各方面的力量，为各钢厂赶制了一批运输起重设备，加上物资、运输部门之间大协作的开展，运输效率大大提高，加速了钢铁原材料的调运工作。由于化铁炉技术改造的实现，去硫效率的提高，辅助材料用量随之大量增加。这时，炼钢指挥部又会同市原材料指挥部分别召开了一系列的专门会议，组织了一百多家生产辅助材料的工厂，挖掘生产潜力，增产氧气、石灰、矽铁、耐火材料等辅助材料，及时保证了钢厂的需要。市第一商业局也在各重点钢厂设立工作组，所属的十一个采购供应站、专业公司也派出驻厂员，上门服务。钢厂需要什么检修设备用的材料，就支援什么材料；工厂什么时候要，就什么时候送到。
      一手抓思想工作
      一手抓完成任务
    由于领导统一，力量集中，广泛协作，各部门支援钢铁的任务都完成得非常迅速及时，使各钢厂在夺钢大战中争得主动，赢得时间。
    在集中力量为钢而战中，上海有关领导部门采取一手抓思想，一手抓任务，以抓思想带任务，因而广大干部和群众服从全局、确保重点的自觉性大大提高。完成任务有坚实的思想基础。各个工厂、企业在安排生产任务中，都把与钢铁生产有关的任务放在第一位，“一路开绿灯”。上钢一厂急需要一台七十五吨的行车，上海起重运输机械厂等二十多家工厂，接受了这个任务。过去要六个多月完成的任务，这次四十多天就完成了。
    保证了重点　带动了一般
    以钢为纲的群众运动，还有力地促进了其他工业部门的增产节约运动。在市委的统一领导和全面安排下，既保证了重点，又带动了一般。全市机械工厂采取大协作方式，分工承担了一批冶金设备的紧急制造任务。这些任务时间急，要求高，但化整为零，分到各厂，不但很快完成，还促使整个企业的生产、技术、管理水平进一步提高，对其他产品的生产，也起了促进作用。
    现在，上海钢铁战线正在掀起一个新的高潮，广大职工正在继续运用集中力量打歼灭战这一经验，再接再厉，夺取今年钢铁生产的全胜。（附图片）
