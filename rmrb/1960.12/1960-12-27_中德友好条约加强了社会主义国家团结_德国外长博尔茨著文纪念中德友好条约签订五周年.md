Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 25th: German Democratic Republic Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Bolz published an article in today's *Neues Deutschland* commemorating the fifth anniversary (December 25th) of the signing of the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between Germany and China.

The article stated that the signing of this great treaty was the result of friendship and brotherly cooperation between the two countries. The signing of the treaty initiated a new stage in further strengthening and consolidating our friendship.

The article stated that although our two countries are separated by thousands of miles, we stand side-by-side within the powerful collective of socialist countries. The statement of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of All Countries emphasized that the most important international condition for defending the achievements of the socialist camp and further achieving success is that all socialist countries help and support each other and utilize all the advantages of the united socialist camp. Therefore, all socialist countries must safeguard the unity of their camp. The Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between Germany and China precisely contributes to this. The article stated that the mutual relations between socialist countries are guided by the common interests of all the people of socialist countries in the struggle for socialism and peace, and are guided by the unified thought of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries.

The article stated that in the five years since the signing of the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, our two countries have achieved great success in the development of friendly relations and in mutually supporting each other in resolving major political issues of our two countries. The German Democratic Republic supports the just demands of the Chinese people: that the American aggressor troops withdraw from the Taiwan area and liberate Chinese territory. We fully agree with the reasonable proposal made by Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev at the 15th UN General Assembly: to exclude the Chiang Kai-shek representative from the United Nations and restore the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. All peace-loving people in Germany, especially the residents of the German Democratic Republic, express their heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese people and government for supporting the German people in their struggle against West German militarism, for striving to conclude a peace treaty, and for creating a demilitarized free city—West Berlin. The article stated that on the basis of the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation and in the spirit of the Moscow Conference, the brotherly relations between our two countries will be further developed and consolidated.

    中德友好条约加强了社会主义国家团结
    德国外长博尔茨著文纪念中德友好条约签订五周年
    新华社柏林25日电　德意志民主共和国副总理兼外交部长博尔茨今天在《新德意志报》上发表文章，纪念德中友好合作条约（12月25日）签订五周年。
    文章说，这个伟大条约的签订是两国友好和兄弟般合作的结果。条约的签订开始了进一步加强和巩固我们友谊的新阶段。
    文章说，我们两国虽然遥隔千里，但是并排地站在社会主义国家强大的集体之中。各国共产党和工人党代表会议声明强调说，保卫社会主义阵营的成果和进一步取得成就的最重要的国际条件是，所有社会主义国家互相帮助和互相支援，以及利用社会主义阵营团结一致的全部优越性。因此，所有社会主义国家要维护他们阵营的团结一致。德中友好合作条约正是对此作出了贡献。文章说，社会主义国家之间的相互关系，是以社会主义国家全体人民在为社会主义和和平的斗争中的共同利益为指导的，是以社会主义国家共产党和工人党的统一的思想为指导的。
    文章说，在友好合作条约签订以来的五年中，我们两国在友好关系的发展方面，在对解决两国政治上重大问题的互相支持方面，都取得了很大的成就。德意志民主共和国支持中国人民正义的要求：美国侵略军从台湾地区撤出去和解放中国的领土。我们完全同意苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在十五届联大上提出的合理建议：把蒋介石代表从联合国排除出去，恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位。德国所有爱好和平的人，特别是德意志民主共和国居民对中国人民和政府支持德国人民反对西德军国主义，争取缔结和约和创造非军事化自由城市——西柏林的斗争表示衷心的感谢。文章说，在友好合作条约的基础上和根据莫斯科会议的精神，我们两国之间的兄弟般的关系将得到进一步的发展和巩固。
