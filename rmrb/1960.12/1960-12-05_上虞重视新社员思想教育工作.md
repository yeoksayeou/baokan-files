Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, December 4th: Shangyu County, Zhejiang Province, at all levels of the Party Committee, has strengthened the ideological education of new commune members returning to the front line of agricultural production and has properly arranged their production and lives, enabling them to fully exert their positive roles. Among the 2,050 new commune members of Songxia Commune, recently, through mass comparisons of thought, labor, and contact with the masses, 1,012 were rated as "three-good" commune members by the commune members, and more than 400 were rated as production team or squad model commune members.

After the new commune members arrived at the forefront of agricultural production, Party organizations at all levels invited advanced agricultural producers, former transferred cadres, and advanced figures who had returned to their hometowns to farm to share their personal experiences, introducing the tremendous changes and development prospects of the commune and team. This enabled the new commune members to further recognize the excellent current situation in the countryside, firmly establish the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation and grain as the key link, and become more fond of rural areas and agricultural labor. The new commune members of Shangbao Production Team of Dongguan Commune, upon returning to the village, invited their fellow villagers to survey the fields. Discovering that the winter planting fertilizer preparations were insufficient, they discussed how to increase fertilizer accumulation. Zhao Sishi, a new commune member with experience in burning ash fertilizer, volunteered to take on the task of burning scorched mud ash. Based on the advanced experience of Sheng County and other places, he adopted the method of igniting from all sides and burning from the outside to the inside, increasing the efficiency of burning scorched mud ash by 50% compared to the original method.

Many new commune members, through the arrangements of Party organizations at all levels, were able to make the best use of their talents. The new commune members of Chengguan Commune, who were originally handicraft workers, repaired more than 40,400 pieces of farm tools, including rice buckets, rice threshers, deep plows, and large sickles, in the two months before and after the autumn harvest and winter planting. Returning educated youth brought scientific and cultural knowledge to the countryside, and many also served as squad recorders and newspaper readers. Some new commune members with weaker physiques were assigned to livestock breeding, vegetable production, and logistics positions, replacing some of the strong laborers to engage in grain production, ensuring that the strong rural labor force was concentrated on the main attack front.

Under the attention and call of Party committees at all levels, cadres and commune members who were originally in the countryside enthusiastically helped the new commune members learn rural work and agricultural production techniques. They used methods such as master-apprentice instruction, old leading the new, strong leading the weak, practical operation during the day, and technical lessons by veteran farmers in the evening, enabling the new commune members to quickly grasp the initial rural work methods and production knowledge. Party organizations at all levels also attached great importance to some of the new commune members' personal needs, properly arranging the new commune members' food, accommodation, childcare for female commune members, and after-school studies for returning students. All of these effectively mobilized the new commune members' enthusiasm for production.

    上虞重视新社员思想教育工作
    新华社杭州4日电　浙江上虞县各级党委加强对回到农业生产第一线的新社员的思想教育，并且妥善地安排了他们的生产和生活，使他们充分发挥积极作用。崧厦公社的二千零五十名新社员，最近通过群众性的比思想、比劳动、比联系群众，被社员们评为“三好”社员的就有一千零十二名，被评为生产队或小队标兵社员的有四百多人。
    在新社员到农业生产第一线后，各级党组织都请农业先进生产者及原有下放干部和回乡务农的先进人物现身说法，介绍本社、本队的巨大变化及发展远景等，使新社员进一步认清当前农村的大好形势，牢固地树立以农业为基础、以粮为纲的思想，更加热爱农村和农业劳动。东关公社上堡生产队重返农村的新社员，一回到村里，就邀同乡亲们一起踏看田间，发现冬种肥料还准备得不够充分，就商量怎样来增积肥料。原来对烧灰肥有经验的新社员赵四十主动提出担任烧焦泥灰任务。他根据嵊县等地的先进经验，采用四周点火、由外向内燃烧的办法，使烧焦泥灰的工效比原来提高了50％。
    许多新社员经过各级党组织的安排，做到了人尽其才。城关公社原是手工业工人的新社员，在秋收冬种前后的两个月中突击修好了稻桶、打稻机、深耕犁、大镰刀等四万零四百多件农具。回乡知识青年把科学文化知识带下乡，不少人还兼任了小队记工员和读报员。还有些体力较弱的新社员被分配在畜牧、蔬菜生产和后勤工作岗位上，替代出部分精壮劳力从事粮食生产，保证了农村强壮劳动力集中于主攻战线上。
    在各级党委的重视和号召下，原来在农村的干部、社员都热情地帮助新社员学会农村工作和农业生产技术。他们用以师带徒、以老带新、以强带弱，白天实际操作、晚间由老农上技术课等办法，使新社员很快地初步掌握了农村工作方法和生产知识。各级党组织还非常重视新社员的一些切身要求，妥善安排新社员的吃、住，女社员的托儿，回乡学生的业余学习等。这些都有效地调动了新社员的生产积极性。
