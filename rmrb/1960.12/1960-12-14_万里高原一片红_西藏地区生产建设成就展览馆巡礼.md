    A Sea of Red on the Plateau
    A Visit to the Exhibition Hall of Production and Construction Achievements in the Tibet Region
　　By Our Correspondent Zhao Jialie
    The Exhibition Hall of Production and Construction Achievements in the Tibet Region was inaugurated on November 30th in Lhasa. The exhibition hall is located in Norbulingka and is divided into eleven sections: agriculture and animal husbandry, industry, automobile transportation, highways, construction, postal and telecommunications, finance and trade (including local products and handicrafts), culture and education, health, new technologies, and military affairs. With thousands of exhibits, it demonstrates the unprecedented and enormous achievements made in agricultural and animal husbandry production after the serfs were liberated, and it shows that the Party is leading the Tibetan people to advance bravely along the bright road of socialism.
    As you enter the Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Hall, surrounded by red flags and clusters of flowers, a solemn and benevolent bust of Chairman Mao and a golden and brilliant five-star appear, flanked by a pair of large red couplets. The couplet reads: "Democratic reform brings bumper harvests of grains; Three antis and two benefits bring prosperity to the six domestic animals." How profound is the meaning of this couplet! It stirs the heart of every visitor. In the nine years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, especially in the past year or so, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, a magnificent democratic reform movement has swept across the Tibetan Plateau. The reactionary, dark, cruel, and barbaric feudal serf system has been smashed by the awakened millions of serfs. A magnificent agricultural and animal husbandry production movement is vigorously unfolding in the vast rural and pastoral areas, and the liberated working people have achieved unprecedented bumper harvests in agricultural and animal husbandry production. The mass movement to set up mutual aid teams is in full swing....
    The huge red bumper harvest charts and the actual bumper harvest products sent from various places in the exhibition hall record the bumper harvest miracles of various regions. In Pari, at an altitude of 4,500 meters, which was previously considered unsuitable for grain production, a bumper grain harvest was achieved this year, and potatoes, radishes, turnips, and other crops also grew very well. A passage in the commentary says it well: "The hardworking and brave Tibetan people have ended the history of Pari Plateau not producing grain today, and even more miracles will appear in agricultural production tomorrow." Shannan Prefecture, known as the granary of Tibet, shows the excellent situation of agricultural production with its fruitful products. The unit area yield and total output of this prefecture have increased significantly this year. Among the exhibits from various prefectures are rice successfully grown for the first time, crops that ripen twice a year, hemp that is more than a zhang tall, tobacco leaves that are more than a chi wide, tall rape, thick and long corn, strings of chili peppers..., many of which are things that Tibet did not have in the past but have now been successfully trial-planted. Over the past few years, state-owned farms have made great contributions on the front lines of agricultural production in Tibet. In 1953, the farms cultivated only ten kinds of grain crops and no more than twenty kinds of vegetables; but now, the experimental planting of grain crop varieties has increased to 2,256 kinds, and the vegetable varieties have also increased to 1,050 kinds. The 21 excellent varieties of highland barley and wheat that have been tested have been welcomed by the majority of farmers.
    In the exhibition hall, the products planted personally by General Tan Guansan, political commissar of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, are the most eye-catching. Every visitor is filled with awe when they see the agricultural products such as apples, peppers, potatoes, corn, pumpkins, and green onions planted personally by the general. The People's Liberation Army on the Tibetan Plateau, whether officers or soldiers, always maintains and promotes the glorious tradition of the People's Army, defending the national defense with a gun in one hand and building the border region with a hoe in the other. In 1960, the grain harvested from the wasteland cultivated by various units reached more than 1.5 million jin, the vegetables harvested reached more than 40 million jin, and other sideline productions such as hunting, fishing, pig raising, and sheep grazing also had large harvests. The vast number of government cadres on the Tibetan Plateau also actively responded to the Party's call and vigorously carried out grain, vegetable, and sideline production, improved their own lives, and reduced the burden on the country. In 1960, Lhasa and the various prefectural organs have already achieved complete self-sufficiency in vegetables, and partial self-sufficiency in non-staple foods such as oil and meat, and at the same time, produced a batch of grain.
    Agriculture is developing rapidly, and animal husbandry production is also developing greatly. The sweet voice of the commentator introduced the audience to the vast grasslands. In the nine years since the peaceful liberation, especially in the past year or so after the suppression of the rebellion, the grasslands have undergone tremendous changes. The vast grasslands, from the Jinsha River in the east to the Ali Prefecture in the west, have awakened under the brilliant light of Chairman Mao. So far, the "Three Antis and Two Benefits" movement has been completed or is about to be completed in areas with a population of about 200,000, and animal husbandry production has also begun to develop. Thousands of kinds of veterinary drugs and equipment provided by the state to support Tibet are on display here, as well as the great achievements of animal husbandry and veterinary workers. In order to prevent the prevalence of livestock diseases, the state has successively sent a large number of animal husbandry and veterinary workers as early as 1952, and trained a group of Tibetan veterinary technicians. They resolutely implemented the principle of "prevention first, prevention outweighs treatment, and prevention and treatment are combined," traveled to countless pastures, and repeatedly prevented or eradicated epidemics such as rinderpest. In the past nine years, they have treated livestock two million times and prevented livestock diseases four million eight hundred thousand times, and are affectionately called "friends of the herders" by the majority of herders. In order to better help Tibet prevent livestock diseases and develop animal husbandry production, the state also invested in the establishment of the Lhasa Serum Factory in 1954 to produce various serums and vaccines locally. Since the Lhasa Serum Factory was put into production in 1955, it has produced a total of 1.05 million milliliters of serum and 6.41 million milliliters of vaccine. In the areas where the "Three Antis and Two Benefits" movement is being carried out, the herders' enthusiasm for production is unprecedentedly high, and some places have tried to set up mutual aid groups for animal husbandry production, so that a new situation has begun to appear in this year's animal husbandry production. According to the statistics of Linzhou County alone, the number of large livestock has increased by 13% this year, and the number of sheep has increased by 14%. The Gongbu school district of Dalong County has witnessed the miracle of thousands of sheep producing two litters a year. The herders praised the new life in this way: "The Communist Party is like the sun, shining on the grasslands, with lush grass and strong cattle and sheep, bringing happiness that is better than paradise."
    Many exhibits in the industrial hall show that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, Tibet's industry has also achieved unprecedented development in the nine years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Before liberation, Tibet did not have a single modern factory, and its underground mineral resources had never been uncovered. After liberation, the secrets of Tibet's underground treasures began to be opened up, and automobile repair shops, farm tool factories, hydropower stations, coal mines, and forest farms were also built. All of these have laid a good foundation for the gradual development of Tibet's industry.
    On the construction of highways on the roof of the world, great achievements have also written a new page in history. Under Chairman Mao's instruction of "To help all fraternal nationalities, be fearless of difficulties, and work hard to build roads," over the past few years, highway construction workers on the plateau have, with the heroic spirit of "making high mountains bow their heads and rivers give way," built a highway network extending in all directions on the Tibetan Plateau where there were no highways in the past, with a mileage of more than 10,000 kilometers. The volume of automobile transportation in 1960 increased sevenfold compared to 1958 and fifteenfold compared to 1955.
    The exhibition hall shows that Tibet's postal and telecommunications, finance and trade, and cultural, educational, and health undertakings are also developing rapidly. Tibet, which originally could not talk about any postal and telecommunications undertakings, has now formed a plateau postal and telecommunications network extending in all directions with Lhasa as the center. In the past year or so, the number of postal and telecommunications service stations has increased fourfold compared to before, and the number of communication networks has increased threefold compared to before. With the great victory of suppressing the rebellion and democratic reform, financial and trade work has taken on a new look. The Finance and Trade Hall tells the audience that the commercial system operated by the three major lords and exploiting the vast working people through high-interest usury has been destroyed, and a commercial network led by the state-owned economy and serving the production and life of the vast people has been formed. State-owned trading institutions have expanded from the original prefectural supply points to every county. The vast number of liberated farmers have also established supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives with districts and townships as units. The supply of goods in various places has increased several times to dozens of times compared to before the suppression of the rebellion, and the purchase of local specialties such as hides, wool, caterpillar fungus, and musk has also greatly increased.
    Handicraft production is also changing. In the year or so since the beginning of democratic reform, because it has shifted from serving the consumption of the serf owners in the past to serving agricultural production and the lives of the vast working people, it has developed more rapidly than in the previous years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet. According to statistics from Lhasa City, more than 2,600 handicraft workers who were unemployed or semi-employed in the past have now been employed with the help of the government, and more than 90% of the handicraft workers have participated in handicraft production mutual aid groups in various industries. The output value of Lhasa City's handicrafts in 1960 is equivalent to four times the annual output value before the suppression of the rebellion, and the products have reached more than 1.7 million pieces, an increase of sixfold compared to before, thereby correspondingly meeting the needs of agricultural production and farmers' lives in the Lhasa area.
    In the past, there were only a few primary schools in Tibet, and the serfs had no right to study at all. Now, the liberated serfs have established more than 1,500 private primary schools, and the government has also established 13 primary schools, 1 complete middle school, and 3 junior high school classes for the children of the vast working people. At present, there are more than 37,000 primary and middle school students. In the past, Tibet did not have a single doctor with medical education, no modern medical institution, and no hospital bed, and the health of the vast working people was not guaranteed at all. But now, under the care of the Party and Chairman Mao, the health cause has developed rapidly. A large number of medical workers from all over the motherland have trained a group of Tibetan junior medical personnel here. A total of 121 people's hospitals and health centers and offices have been established in the region, with more than 500 beds set up. In the past few years, more than 5.8 million person-times of diseases have been treated free of charge. What is particularly exciting is that the liberated peasant masses, combined with the patriotic agricultural bumper harvest movement, have launched a patriotic health movement to "eliminate the four pests, pay attention to hygiene, and eliminate epidemics." During the movement, they cleared the garbage accumulated for many years in village alleys and courtyards, and initially changed the situation of feces all over the countryside and stinky water surrounding the villages. Washing faces, washing clothes, and washing cooking utensils are gradually becoming a trend. The vast rural areas of Tibet are undergoing a transformation of customs.
    The exhibition hall, which is as colorful as a garden of flowers and fruitful as an orchard, shows the great achievements that have already been made on the production and construction front in Tibet, and presents people with a bright and splendid future, showing the beautiful picture of a sea of red on the plateau under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao.

    万里高原一片红
    西藏地区生产建设成就展览馆巡礼
　　本报记者　赵家烈
    西藏地区生产建设成就展览馆，于11月30日在拉萨揭幕了。展览馆设在罗布林卡，分为农牧、工业、汽车运输、公路、建筑、邮电、财贸（包括土特产和手工业）、文教、卫生、新技术和军事十一个部分。它以成千上万件展品，显示了农奴翻身后，在农牧业生产上取得的空前巨大成绩，显示了党正领导着西藏人民，向着社会主义的光明大道奋勇前进。
    一走进农牧馆，在红旗围绕和鲜花簇拥中，出现了庄严慈祥的毛主席半身塑像和一颗金光灿烂的五星，两旁是一副大红对联。上面写着：“民主改革五谷丰登，三反两利六畜兴旺。”这副对联的寓意多么深远啊！它激动着每个观众的心。在和平解放西藏九年来，特别是最近一年多来，西藏地区在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，气势磅礴的民主改革运动，席卷了西藏高原。反动的、黑暗的、残酷的、野蛮的封建农奴制度，被觉醒了的百万农奴打烂砸碎了。波澜壮阔的农牧业大生产运动，在广大的农村和牧场蓬勃展开，翻身解放了的广大劳动人民，取得了史无前例的农牧业生产大丰收。大办互助组的群众运动，正方兴未艾……。
    展览馆里巨幅的红色丰产榜和各地送来的丰产实物，记载着各地的丰产奇迹。在海拔四千五百米的帕里，过去一向被认为不产粮食，今年却获得了粮食丰收，洋芋、萝卜、蔓菁等也生长得很好。有一段解说词说得好：“勤劳勇敢的藏族人民，今天结束了帕里高原不出粮的历史，明天在农业生产上还将出现更多的奇迹。”一向有西藏粮仓之称的山南专区，以果实累累的产品展示出农业生产的一派大好形势。这个专区今年的单位面积产量和总产量，都有了大幅度的增长。在各专区的展品中，有第一次试种成功的水稻、一年两熟的农作物，有一丈多高的大麻，一尺多宽的烟叶，高大的油菜，又粗又长的玉米，成串的辣椒……，其中有许多是西藏过去没有的东西，现在已经试种成功了。几年来，国营农场在西藏农业生产战线上，作出了很大贡献。在1953年，农场栽培的粮食作物品种不过十种，蔬菜品种也不过二十种；可是现在，试验种植的粮食作物品种，已增加到二千二百五十六种，蔬菜品种也增加到了一千零五十种，试验出来的二十一个青稞、小麦优良品种，受到了广大农民的欢迎。
    展览馆里，中国人民解放军西藏军区政治委员谭冠三将军亲手种植的产品，最引人注目。当每个观众看了将军亲手种植出来的苹果、辣椒、洋芋、玉米、南瓜、大葱等农产品时，都肃然起敬。西藏高原上的解放军，无论军官或士兵，始终保持和发扬人民军队的光荣传统，一手拿枪保卫国防，一手拿镐建设边疆。1960年各部队开荒收获的粮食，就达一百五十多万斤，收获的蔬菜达四千多万斤，其他如打猎、捕鱼、养猪、牧羊等各项副业生产，也有大量的收获。在西藏高原的广大机关干部，也积极响应党的号召，大力开展粮食、蔬菜和副业生产，改善了自己的生活，减轻了国家的负担。在1960年，拉萨和各专区机关已经作到了蔬菜全部自给，油和肉等副食品也作到部分自给，同时还生产了一批粮食。
    农业在飞跃发展，牧业生产也有很大的发展。解说员动听的声音，把观众引入了辽阔的草原。和平解放九年来，特别是平叛后这一年多来，草原在巨变。东起金沙江畔、西到阿里专区的辽阔草原，在毛主席的光辉照耀下苏醒了。到目前为止，约二十万人口的地区，已经完成或即将完成“三反两利”运动，牧业生产也在开始发展。这里展出了千百种国家支援西藏的各种兽药和器械，展出了畜牧兽医工作者的巨大成绩。为了防治牲畜疫病的流行，国家早在1952年，就陆续派来了大批的畜牧兽医工作人员，培训了一批藏族兽医技术人员。他们坚决执行了“以防为主、防重于治、防治兼施”的方针，走遍了无数牧场，多次防止或扑灭了牛瘟等疫情。九年中，他们共治疗牲畜二百万头次，预防牲畜疫病四百八十万头次，被广大牧民亲切地称为“牧民之友”。国家为了更好地帮助西藏进行防治牲畜疫病，发展牧业生产，在1954年，还投资建立了拉萨血清厂，就地生产各种血清和疫苗。拉萨血清厂从1955年投入生产以来，共生产了血清一百零五万毫升，生产疫苗六百四十一万毫升。在开展“三反两利”运动的地区，牧民们生产热情空前高涨，有的地方试办了牧业生产互助组，使今年的牧业生产开始出现了新的局面。仅据林周县的统计，今年的大牲畜，就增长了13％，羊增长了14％。打隆县工布学区，出现了数千只羊一年两产的奇迹。牧民们这样歌颂新的生活：“共产党像太阳，太阳照到草原上，水草丰，牛羊壮，带来幸福赛天堂。”
    工业馆里的许多展品说明，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，和平解放西藏九年来，西藏工业也获得了史无前例的发展。解放前，西藏没有一个现代化工厂，地下矿藏资源一直未被揭开。解放后，西藏地下宝藏的秘密开始被打开了，还建起了汽车修配厂、农具厂、水电站、煤矿、林场。所有这些，都为逐步发展西藏工业奠定了良好的基础。
    在世界屋脊的公路建设上，也以巨大的成绩写下了历史的新页。在毛主席“为了帮助各兄弟民族，不怕困难，努力筑路”的指示下，几年来，高原筑路职工以“让高山低头，叫河水让路”的英雄气概，在过去没有一条公路的西藏高原上，劈山填壑，修成了四通八达的公路网，通车里程在一万公里以上。1960年的汽车运输量，比1958年提高了七倍，比1955年提高了十五倍。
    展览馆上表明，西藏的邮电、财贸和文教卫生事业，也在飞跃发展。原来根本谈不上什么邮电事业的西藏，现在以拉萨为中心，组成了高原四通八达的邮电网。近一年多来，邮电服务所较前增长了四倍，通讯网路较前增长了三倍。随着平息叛乱、民主改革的伟大胜利，财贸工作出现了崭新的面貌。财贸馆告诉观众：以三大领主经营、以高利盘剥广大劳动人民的商业体系被摧毁了，以国营经济为领导、为广大人民群众的生产和生活服务的商业网业已形成。国营贸易机构已由原来的专区供应点，扩大到县县皆有。广大翻身农民又以区、乡为单位，建立了供销合作社和信用合作社。各地商品的供应，较平叛前增加了几倍到几十倍，皮张、羊毛、虫草、麝香等土特产品的收购，也大大增加。
    手工业生产也在变。从民主改革开始的一年多来，由于把过去为农奴主的消费服务，转向了为农业生产服务，为广大劳动人民的生活服务，因此较和平解放西藏以来的前几年，有了更为迅速的发展。据拉萨市的统计，过去失业和半失业的二千六百多手工业者，现在在政府的帮助下，都已就业，90％以上的手工业从业人员，参加了各种行业的手工业生产互助组。拉萨市1960年的手工业产值，已相当于平叛前年产值的四倍，产品已达到一百七十多万件，较前增长了六倍，从而相应地满足了拉萨地区农业生产和农民生活的需要。
    过去西藏的小学不过寥寥几所，农奴根本没有读书的权利。现在翻身的农奴，办起了一千五百多所民办小学，政府又为广大劳动人民子女，办起了十三所小学、一所完全中学和三个初中班。目前，中小学生已有三万七千多人。过去，西藏没有一个受过医学教育的医生，没有一所现代医疗机构，没有一张病床，广大劳动人民的健康，根本没有保证。可是现在，在党和毛主席的关怀下，卫生事业有了飞跃的发展。从祖国各地来的大批医疗工作者，在这里培训了一批藏族初级医务人员。全区建立了一百二十一个人民医院和卫生院、所，设置了五百多张病床。几年来，免费治疗了五百八十多万人次疾病。特别使人兴奋的是，翻身农民群众结合农业爱国丰产运动，掀起了一个“除四害、讲卫生、消灭疫病”的爱国卫生运动。在运动中，他们清除了村巷院落中积存了多年的垃圾，初步改变了农村粪便遍地、臭水绕村的面貌。洗脸、洗衣、洗炊具，正逐渐形成风气。广大西藏农村，正经历着一场移风易俗的变革。
    万紫千红、鲜花硕果般的展览馆，显示出了西藏生产建设战线上已经取得的巨大成绩，给人们展现出了一个光辉灿烂的未来，展示出了在党和毛主席的领导下，万里高原一片红的美丽图景。（附图片）
