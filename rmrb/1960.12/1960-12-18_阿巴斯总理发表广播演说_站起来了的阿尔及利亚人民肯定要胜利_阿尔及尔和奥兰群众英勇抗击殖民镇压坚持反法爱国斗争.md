Xinhua News Agency, December 17th dispatch: Tunis -- Premier Abbas of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic delivered a radio address to the Algerian people in Tunis on the 16th, encouraging the large-scale demonstrations against French imperialist colonial rule that have recently erupted in major Algerian cities. He once again called on the Algerian people to make full preparations to shatter the conspiracy of the French de Gaulle government to create a puppet regime in Algeria through a "referendum."

Abbas pointed out that the Algerian people taking the streets and shouting slogans such as "Long Live the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic" and “Long Live Independent Algeria" once again declared their determination to live freely and independently.

Abbas said to the Algerian people, "Faced with your courage that frightens the enemy, faced with your tenacious patriotic enthusiasm that wins the admiration of all justice- and freedom-loving people, every Algerian feels all the glory and pride of being a member of the Algerian nation."

Abbas said, "The Algerian people, who have suffered oppression and enslavement for more than a century and have endured suppression, torture, and sacrifice since launching an uprising six years ago, have stood up this week with an irresistible force and faced the enemy's bullets with their chests bared"; "In this way, you have written a new glorious page in our history with the blood of martyrs."

He said: The Algerian people have given the colonialists "a severe lesson."

Abbas also told the Algerian people that they are no longer isolated in their struggle. He said: "The battle you are waging is of great magnitude. The whole world sees it as a brilliant victory in our struggle for national liberation." He added, "We have received telegrams of solidarity from all over the world. People of all countries are closely watching our struggle, which has become a symbol of strength and heroism. In fact, Algeria's independence is growing day by day. Victory is certain."

In his speech, Abbas once again angrily condemned the atrocities of French imperialism. He emphasized: "The truth has come to light. The presence of this (French) army is the main pillar of the colonial order and the main obstacle to any genuine solution to the Algerian problem."

When talking about de Gaulle's conspiracy to hold a "referendum" and create a puppet regime in Algeria, Abbas appealed to the Algerian people: "This is another battle you must be fully prepared to face, and you must oppose this sinister trick."

Xinhua News Agency, December 16th dispatch: Algiers -- Under the French colonial authorities' intensified bloody suppression, the anti-French patriotic struggle of the people in the French-occupied area of Algeria is continuing under extremely difficult circumstances.

The French colonial authorities are currently mobilizing a large number of military police to surround the Arab residential areas of major Algerian cities and are carrying out large-scale arrests of Algerian patriots. French colonial military police have canceled all leaves and continue to deploy forces in all strategic areas of cities in French-occupied Algeria. Fully armed patrols, armored vehicles, and military helicopters are dispatched all day long. The "curfew" continues to be in effect. Vichzyna, the commander of the colonial army in Algiers, announced on the 15th that gatherings of more than ten people in public places were prohibited.

However, the heroic Algerian people are still persisting in their struggle under very difficult circumstances. According to reports, patriots in the Casbah district of Algiers still gathered a force of 1,500 people on the 15th, broke through the encirclement, and demonstrated in the government square. On the evening of the 15th, they formed many smaller groups, shouting revolutionary slogans, and continued to demonstrate throughout the night in the Casbah district for the third consecutive night. In order to obscure the sight of the colonial military police, they destroyed street lighting and gathered and marched in the dark. In Oran, Algeria's second largest city, a strike movement is unfolding throughout the city, and Muslim shops are also holding a general strike to protest the atrocities of the French colonialists and express condolences to the martyred patriots. The people of Dellys also went on strike and closed shops on the 15th.

The strike of Muslim university students in Algiers is also continuing.

French President de Gaulle, who was driven back to France by the storm of the Algerian people's struggle, hastily convened a cabinet meeting on the 15th to "study the Algerian situation." Joxe, the Minister of State in charge of Algerian affairs, reported at the meeting on the measures taken "to maintain order." The National Defense Committee of the French National Assembly also held a meeting on the 14th to study the "military situation in Algeria." After the meeting, it claimed that it was necessary to "maintain the existing level" of the French colonial army in Algeria and clamored that "it is necessary to improve the equipment of the (colonial) army stationed in Algeria" in order to suppress the Algerian people.

Xinhua News Agency, December 17th dispatch: Paris -- French Prime Minister Debré, speaking in the French National Assembly on the 16th in response to the heroic patriotic demonstrations held by the Algerian people for days in a row in their struggle for independence, reiterated France's intention to continue occupying Algeria. He said that any solution to the Algerian problem "cannot" mean that France abandons Algeria.

He reiterated that the "necessary prerequisite" for Algerians to exercise "self-determination" is the so-called "end of combat" by surrendering to the French colonial army. He also threatened that "the path has been chosen." If the leaders of Algeria refuse to take this path, France will continue to implement its so-called "pacification and development" policy in Algeria.

    阿巴斯总理发表广播演说
    站起来了的阿尔及利亚人民肯定要胜利
    阿尔及尔和奥兰群众英勇抗击殖民镇压坚持反法爱国斗争
    据新华社17日讯　突尼斯消息：阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯16日在突尼斯向阿尔及利亚人民发表广播演说，鼓励阿尔及利亚人民最近在各大城市掀起的反对法帝国主义殖民统治的大规模示威斗争，并且再一次号召阿尔及利亚人民作好充分准备，来粉碎法国戴高乐政府企图通过“公民投票”在阿尔及利亚制造傀儡政权的阴谋。
    阿巴斯指出，阿尔及利亚人民走上大街，高喊“阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府万岁”和“独立的阿尔及利亚万岁”这样的口号，这就再一次宣布了他们要求自由而独立地生活的决心。
    阿巴斯向阿尔及利亚人民说，“面对着你们那使得敌人惊慌失措的勇气，面对着你们那赢得一切爱好正义和自由人们的钦佩的顽强爱国热情，每一个阿尔及利亚人都感到了做阿尔及利亚民族一分子的全部光荣和骄傲。”
    阿巴斯说，“一个多世纪以来遭受压迫和奴役、并在六年前发动起义以来遭受镇压、酷刑和牺牲的阿尔及利亚人民，本星期以一种不可抗拒的力量站起来了，并且袒着胸膛迎接敌人的子弹”；“这样，你们就用烈士的鲜血写下了我们历史上新的光辉的一页”。
    他说：阿尔及利亚人民已经给殖民主义者“一个严厉的教训”。
    阿巴斯还告诉阿尔及利亚人民，他们在斗争中不再是孤立的了。他说：“你们进行的战斗规模很大。全世界都把它看作是我们争取民族解放斗争中的一个辉煌的胜利。”他又说，“我们收到来自全世界的表示声援的电报。世界各国人民都在密切注视着我们的斗争已经成为强毅和英雄主义的象征。事实上，阿尔及利亚的独立正在与日俱增。胜利是肯定的”。
    阿巴斯在演说中再一次愤怒地谴责法帝国主义的暴行。他强调说：“真相已经大白。这支（法国）军队的存在是殖民秩序的主要支柱，是任何真正解决阿尔及利亚问题的主要障碍。”
    阿巴斯在谈到戴高乐准备搞“公民投票”、在阿尔及利亚制造傀儡政权的阴谋时，向阿尔及利亚人民呼吁说：“这是你们必须作好充分准备来对付的另一场战斗，你们必须反对这个阴险的骗局。”
    据新华社16日讯　阿尔及尔消息：在法国殖民当局加紧进行血腥镇压下，阿尔及利亚法占区人民的反法爱国斗争正在极端艰巨的情况下继续进行。
    法国殖民当局目前正调集大批军警包围阿尔及利亚各大城市的阿拉伯人居住区，大规模逮捕阿尔及利亚爱国者。法国殖民军警已经取消一切休假，继续在阿尔及利亚法占区城市所有战略地区布防。全副武装的巡逻队、装甲车、军用直升飞机整天出动。“宵禁”仍在继续。阿尔及尔殖民军司令维齐纳15日又宣布禁止在公共场所举行十人以上的集会。
    但是，英勇的阿尔及利亚人民在十分困难的情况下仍在坚持斗争。据报道，阿尔及尔卡斯巴区的爱国者，15日仍然集结起了一千五百人的队伍，突破包围，在政府广场上示威。15日晚上，他们组成了许多较小的队伍，高呼着革命的口号，继续第三晚通宵在卡斯巴区内举行示威。为了遮掩殖民军警的视线，他们破坏了街道上的照明设备，在黑暗中集会游行。在阿尔及利亚第二个大城市奥兰，罢工运动正在全市展开，穆斯林商店也举行罢市，抗议法国殖民者的暴行，并对死难的爱国者表示哀悼。德兰仙市人民也在15日罢工和罢市。
    阿尔及尔穆斯林大学生的罢课也在继续。
    被阿尔及利亚人民斗争的风暴赶回法国的法国总统戴高乐，15日慌忙召开内阁会议“研究阿尔及利亚局势”。负责阿尔及利亚事务的国务部长若克斯在会上报告了“为维持秩序”而采取的措施。法国国民议会国防委员会14日也举行会议研究“阿尔及利亚的军事形势”，会后声称需要把在阿尔及利亚的法国殖民军队“维持在现有水平上”，并叫嚷“需要改善驻扎在阿尔及利亚的（殖民）军队的装备”，以镇压阿尔及利亚人民。
    据新华社17日讯　巴黎消息：法国总理德勃雷16日在法国国民议会针对阿尔及利亚人民为争取独立而连日举行的英勇爱国示威，重申法国要继续占领阿尔及利亚。他说，解决阿尔及利亚问题的任何方案都“不可能”意味着法国放弃阿尔及利亚。
    他重申，阿尔及利亚人行使“自决权”的“必要的先决条件”是向法国殖民军投降的所谓“战斗结束”。他并且威胁说，“路已经选定了”，如果阿尔及利亚的领袖们拒绝走这条路，法国就要继续执行它对阿尔及利亚的所谓“平定和发展”的政策。
