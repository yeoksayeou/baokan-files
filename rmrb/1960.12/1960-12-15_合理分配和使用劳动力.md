    Rational Allocation and Use of Labor Force
    He Zuowen
    Rational allocation and use of rural labor, strengthening labor organization, carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution centered on agricultural tool reform, and implementing a combination of work and rest are important links in saving labor, improving the production enthusiasm of laborers, and increasing agricultural labor productivity.
    The allocation of labor force, in addition to the planned and proportionate allocation according to the actual needs of various departments of the national economy, first satisfying the needs of the agricultural front, also requires rational arrangement of labor force in agricultural and non-agricultural sectors in rural work, so that the rural labor force is mainly concentrated on agricultural production, while rationally arranging labor force in aspects such as community-run industry, commerce, culture, education, health, and collective welfare undertakings. The development of these non-agricultural sectors in rural areas must be premised on the development of agricultural production and serve the development of agricultural production. Therefore, all undertakings and activities held in rural areas must be strictly controlled; and it is necessary to deeply understand the seasonality of agricultural production, doing more in slack seasons, less in busy seasons, and none in extremely busy seasons, without emphasizing specialization in everything, occupying a large number of labor force year-round, and affecting agricultural production. Whenever semi-labor and auxiliary labor can be used, strong labor should not be used. It is absolutely not allowed for all walks of life to select strong labor and use the remaining old, weak, and women for agricultural production. The so-called rational arrangement of labor should highlight the key points, first ensuring the needs of developing agricultural production, rather than proceeding simultaneously without distinguishing priorities. Any practice that disperses forces and negates key points is incorrect. Of course, while ensuring the key points, overall consideration should also be given to rationally arranging labor force in other aspects. In the agricultural production sector, the allocation of labor force should also rationally arrange the labor force required for grain production and diversified operations according to the needs of taking grain as the key link and developing in an all-round way, promoting the comprehensive development of agriculture and various construction undertakings.
    At present, after arranging the labor force according to the level of national economic development and the needs of various aspects in rural areas, it should be kept basically unchanged for a relatively long period of time, and the labor force used on the agricultural front should be stabilized in particular, otherwise it will not be possible to ensure the sustained leap forward of agriculture and the entire national economy. However, it is also impossible to expect a one-time solution to the allocation of labor force. Even in a county, a commune, or a production team, after a serious adjustment of the labor force according to the current situation, and determining a proportion of labor force allocation, it is impossible to achieve perfection, let alone remain unchanged. Especially since our current agricultural production level is not high, mainly relying on manual labor, and the seasonality of agricultural production is very strong, various crops are greatly affected by natural disasters such as wind, flood, drought, and insects, which makes agricultural production complex and changeable. Therefore, the organization and use of labor force on the agricultural front requires more flexibility, and the principle of combining comprehensive use and specialized division of labor should be implemented. On the basis of a basic division of labor, the labor force in various aspects should be adjusted in a timely and flexible manner according to the actual needs of various aspects in each period, striving to scientifically arrange and use the labor force to the greatest extent, maximize labor potential and save labor, so as to benefit the development of various production undertakings.
    Rational allocation and use of labor force is inseparable from adhering to the three-level ownership system based on production teams. People's communes are collectively owned, which is different from the ownership by the whole people of state-owned enterprises. The people's communes currently implement a system of unified management, three-level ownership, and team-based system, and implement the principle of "distribution according to work and exchange at equal value," which is stipulated in the Party's policy instructions on people's communes and has been proven correct by experience. The people's communes have embarked on the road of consolidation and development after rectification in accordance with the above principles. The transformation of the people's communes from a basic team ownership system to a basic commune ownership system requires a development process, and the development of the commune-owned economy should never be developed by drawing from team-owned parts, but should rely on running commune-run enterprises and undertakings well, state investment and loans, and drawing a certain proportion of public accumulation funds from production teams in accordance with regulations. Only on the basis of the rapid development of the production teams' economy can the commune's public accumulation funds gradually increase. Therefore, the development of the commune economy must adhere to the principle of team-based system, concentrate the main force, and vigorously develop the team-owned economy. The three-level ownership system based on production teams is the fundamental system of the people's communes at the present stage. The transformation of production relations is based on the development of productive forces. The three-level ownership system based on production teams is suitable for the nature of the current rural productive forces, is compatible with the current development of rural productive forces, and is conducive to the development of production. It must be adhered to and implemented for a considerable period of time. Under the current circumstances, the labor force should be controlled by the production teams. The commune and production team levels can only occupy a small amount of labor force. The production team implements "four fixings" for the production team: labor, land, draft animals, and farm tools. No one should call them at will. When organizing labor cooperation between teams, it should be voluntary, mutually beneficial, and exchange at equal value. The unit receiving cooperation should exchange labor for labor, or evaluate work and record points, and pay remuneration according to work. This allocation and use of labor force is suitable for the current level of productive forces. Otherwise, it will not be possible to fully exert labor potential and will hinder the development of productive forces. Therefore, within the commune, there must be a labor force allocation plan to make the labor force compatible with the production measures.
    Planning and rationally allocating labor force and strengthening labor organization are only one aspect of saving labor force. To save labor force, it is also necessary to continuously improve labor productivity. Only by continuously improving labor productivity can we save labor force more effectively, create as much wealth as possible with as few people as possible, and do as many things as possible.
    The fundamental way to improve agricultural labor productivity is to continue to deepen the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. In recent years, with the development of economic construction, the improvement of agricultural labor productivity has achieved remarkable results, but it should be admitted that today's agricultural labor productivity is still very low, and agricultural production is basically based on manual operation. Therefore, in addition to rationally allocating labor force in various departments of the national economy, concentrating labor force to strengthen the agricultural front and the grain front, and scientifically organizing and using labor force on the agricultural front, it is also necessary to continue to vigorously promote technical innovation and technical revolution centered on agricultural tool reform, accelerate the technological transformation of agriculture, and realize agricultural mechanization and semi-mechanization in a planned way, striving to greatly improve agricultural labor productivity on the existing basis in a relatively short period of time. This is an urgent task before us.
    Implementing the principle of combining political education and material guarantee, and implementing a combination of work and rest are another important measure to fully mobilize the production enthusiasm of laborers and improve labor productivity. Only by adhering to putting politics in command and being very concerned about the lives of the masses, and combining the Party's ideological education work with the implementation of the Party's economic policies and systems, can we continuously improve the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members. We should learn from Comrade Mao Zedong's leadership methods of caring for the masses, educating the masses, and being good at closely combining the immediate economic interests of the masses with the long-term political goals. In the current rural work, specifically speaking, this is to comprehensively arrange the lives of the masses with the running of public canteens as the center, while further strengthening political leadership and grasping ideological education. "Man is iron, food is steel," so the canteen must be run well to ensure that commune members are strong and healthy to devote themselves to production. Another important issue in the lives of the masses is to earnestly implement a combination of work and rest to ensure that commune members have sufficient rest and sleep time. Labor and rest are dialectical relations. In order to "labor" better, there must be appropriate "rest." Only with a certain amount of "rest" can there be lasting "labor." The issue of combining work and rest is actually the issue of labor reproduction. Only by paying attention to combining work and rest can laborers be energetic and labor efficiency continuously improved. Therefore, all activities in rural areas should not occupy the sleep and rest time of commune members, and attention should be paid to hygiene and disease prevention. Special attention should be paid to the special protection of women's labor force. In short, we must conscientiously implement the central government's past instructions, and in leading production, we must conscientiously care about and solve the masses' livelihood problems, and earnestly protect the labor force. Doing so is beneficial to national construction, beneficial to commune production, and beneficial to people's health. It is a good thing that benefits many aspects and should never be taken lightly.

    合理分配和使用劳动力
    贺作文
    合理地分配和使用农村的劳动力，加强劳动组织，开展以农具改革为中心的技术革新和技术革命，实行劳逸结合，这是当前节约劳动力，提高劳动者的生产积极性，提高农业劳动生产率的重要环节。
    劳动力的分配，除了根据国民经济各部门的实际需要进行有计划按比例的分配，首先满足农业战线的需要外，在农村工作中还需要合理安排农业部门和非农业部门的劳动力，使农村劳动力主要集中在农业生产上，同时合理安排社办工业、商业、文教卫生和集体福利事业等方面的劳动力；农村中这些非农业部门的发展，必须以农业生产发展为前提，并服务于农业生产的发展。因此，在农村中举办各项事业和进行各种活动，都必须严格控制；并且必须深刻了解农业生产的季节性，在不影响农业生产的前提下，农闲多办，农忙少办，大忙不办，不能事事强调专业化，长年占用一大批劳动力，影响农业生产。凡是能用半劳动力和辅助劳动力的，都不应该用强劳动力，决不能各行各业都挑选强劳动力，把剩下来的老弱妇孺用于农业生产。所谓合理安排劳力，就应当重点突出，首先保证发展农业生产的需要，而不是不分轻重缓急，齐头并进。任何分散力量，否定重点的作法，都是不正确的。当然，在保证重点的前提下，也应当统筹兼顾，合理地安排其他方面的劳动力。在农业生产部门中劳动力的分配，也应根据以粮为纲、全面发展的需要，合理安排粮食生产和多种经营所需要的劳动力，促进农业和各项建设事业的全面发展。
    目前，根据国民经济发展的水平和农村中各方面的需要，对劳动力进行安排以后，应当在较长的时间内大体保持不变，而用在农业战线上的劳动力尤其应该稳定下来，否则就不能保证农业以及整个国民经济的持续跃进。但也不可能期望一劳永逸地解决劳动力的分配问题。即使在一个县、一个社和一个生产队，根据目前情况对劳动力进行一次认真的调整，确定一个劳动力分配的比例，也不可能作到尽善尽美，更不可能一成不变。特别是目前我们的农业生产水平还不高，主要还是依靠手工劳动，农业生产的季节性很强，各种农作物受风、洪、旱、虫等自然灾害的影响很大，这使农业生产具有复杂多变的特点，因而在农业战线上对劳动力的组织和使用，就需要具有更多的灵活性，实行综合使用和专业分工相结合的原则。在有了一个基本分工的基础上，根据每个时期各方面对劳动力的实际需要，及时地灵活地调剂各方面的劳动力，力求在最大限度上科学地安排和使用劳动力，最大限度地发挥劳动潜力和节约劳力，以利各项生产事业的发展。
    合理分配和使用劳动力，是同坚持生产队为基础的三级所有制分不开的。人民公社是集体所有制，它是同国营企业的全民所有制有区别的。人民公社在目前实行统一管理、三级所有、队为基础的制度，实行“按劳分配、等价交换”的原则，这是党的历次有关人民公社的政策指示所规定，而且已为经验证明是正确的。人民公社按照上述原则进行整顿，才走上了巩固发展的道路。人民公社由基本队所有制变为基本社所有制，是需要经过一个发展过程的，而社有经济的发展，决不应当用抽调队有部分来发展，而应当依靠办好社营企业事业、国家投资和贷款，以及按规定向生产队提出一定比例的公积金来发展。只有在生产队的经济迅速发展的基础上，公社的公积金才能逐渐增加。因此，公社经济的发展，必须坚持队为基础的原则，集中主要力量，大力发展队有经济。以生产队为基础的三级所有制，是现阶段人民公社的根本制度。生产关系的变革，是以生产力的发展为基础的。以生产队为基础的三级所有制是适合目前农村生产力的性质的，是同目前农村生产力发展的情况相适应的，是有利于生产发展的，必须在一个相当长时期内坚持贯彻执行。在目前情况下，劳动力应当归生产小队支配。公社和生产队两级只能占用少量的劳动力。生产队对生产小队实行劳力、土地、耕畜、农具“四固定”，任何人不应随便调用。小队与小队之间组织劳力协作的时候，应当是自愿两利，等价交换，由受协作的单位，以工换工，或评工记分，按劳付酬。这样分配和使用劳动力是适合当前生产力发展水平的，否则就不能充分发挥劳动潜力，就会妨碍生产力的发展。因此，在公社内部，要有劳动力的分配计划，使劳动力和生产措施相适应。
    有计划地合理地分配劳动力，加强劳动组织，只是节约劳动力的一个方面。要做到节约劳动力，还需要不断提高劳动生产率。只有不断提高劳动生产率，才能更加有效地节约劳动力，才能做到以尽可能少的人力，创造出尽可能多的财富，办尽可能多的事情。
    提高农业劳动生产率的根本途径，是继续深入开展技术革新和技术革命运动。几年来，本着经济建设的发展，农业劳动生产率的提高，已经取得了显著的成效，但应当承认，今天的农业劳动生产率还是很低的，农业生产基本上还是靠手工操作的。因此，除了在国民经济各部门中合理地分配劳动力，集中劳动力加强农业战线、粮食战线，以及在农业战线上也要科学地组织劳动力和使用劳动力以外，还需要继续大搞以农具改革为中心的技术革新和技术革命，加速农业技术改造，有步骤地实现农业机械化和半机械化，力争在较短的时间内，在现有基础上，将农业劳动生产率大大提高一步。这是摆在我们面前的一项迫切的任务。
    实行政治教育和物质保证相结合的原则，实行劳逸结合，是充分调动劳动者的生产积极性，提高劳动生产率的另一重要措施。只有坚持政治挂帅，并且十分关心群众的生活，把党的思想教育工作和贯彻执行党的经济政策和制度结合起来，才能不断提高广大社员的劳动积极性。我们应当学习毛泽东同志那种关心群众，教育群众，善于把群众切身经济利益和远大的政治目标密切结合的领导方法。在目前农村工作中，具体说来，这就是在进一步加强政治领导、抓紧思想教育的同时，以办好公共食堂为中心，全面安排好群众的生活。“人是铁，饭是钢”，因此食堂必须办好，保证社员身强力壮地投入生产。群众生活中的另一个重要问题，就是认真执行劳逸结合，保证社员有足够的休息和睡眠时间。劳与逸是辩证的关系，为了更好地“劳”，必须有适当的“逸”，只有一定的“逸”，才能有持久的“劳”。劳逸结合的问题，实际上是劳动力再生产的问题，只有注意劳逸结合，才能使劳动者精力充沛，劳动效率不断提高。因此，农村中的一切活动，都不应占用社员的睡眠和休息时间，并且要注意卫生，防治疾病。特别要重视妇女劳动力的特殊保护。总之，必须认真执行中央历次的指示，在领导生产中必须认真关心并解决群众的生活问题，切实保护劳动力，这样做有利于国家建设，有利于公社生产，有利于人民健康，是一举多得的好事，绝不可等闲视之。
