Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 30th -- Workers in various units of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, in the last quarter of this year's production, are offering conveniences everywhere and taking on difficulties for each other. They are engaging in comprehensive collaboration centered on the open hearth furnace, working together to promote the continuous increase in steel production.

Since October, workers in various factories and mines have launched a competition to "see who serves steel most thoughtfully, comprehensively, promptly, and well," striving to provide open hearth furnaces with whatever they need, whenever they need it, to ensure high-quality and high-yield production. They proactively understand the needs of others, deliver convenience to their doorsteps, and take difficulties upon themselves. The iron-smelting plant, which directly serves various steel plants, has organized a "three-way combination" visiting group, consisting of the factory director, technicians, furnace masters, and workers, to visit each steel plant once a week since July. The factory's leading cadres also take turns attending the production meetings of the steel plants every day to promptly understand the needs of the open hearth furnaces. Therefore, they have gradually achieved the goal of providing the open hearth furnaces with the iron water they need for smelting specific types of steel. To ensure the high-quality iron water needed for rapid steelmaking in the open hearth furnaces, the workers of each blast furnace in the iron-smelting plant are working hard to improve their technology. Most blast furnaces have basically eliminated high-sulfur iron, which has shortened the smelting time in the open hearth furnaces. The First Steel Plant, famous for its extensive collaboration, has implemented comprehensive collaboration among mold preparation, transportation, and open hearth furnace operations, eliminating the long-standing phenomenon of open hearth furnaces waiting for steel ingot molds. Thanks to the close cooperation between upper and lower levels, and left and right units, the workers of the Second Steel Plant reduced the average smelting time per furnace of steel from thirteen hours and fourteen minutes in late October to eleven hours and twenty-four minutes in mid-November.

Due to the workers' further promotion of the communist spirit of seizing difficulties and tackling key problems, many weak links in production have been successively broken through, and equipment hazards have been eliminated in their infancy. Open hearth furnace No. 18 is a model furnace for rapid steelmaking in the Second Steel Plant. By November 20th, the average smelting time of this furnace had been shortened to nine hours and three minutes. However, recently, two slag pockets formed on the north and south water jackets of this furnace, hindering the flow of gas and seriously affecting rapid steelmaking. Ma Lixiang, the furnace master of shift A, immediately organized the workers of his shift to attack the water jackets. Although their smelting time was slightly higher that day, because they promptly eliminated the two water jacket hazards, the furnace was particularly easy to use. As a result, the workers of shift D produced a furnace of steel in six hours and forty-five minutes, setting a new record for rapid steelmaking this year. The average smelting time of this open hearth furnace on that day was also less than eight hours. In early November, the condition of blast furnace No. 3 in the steel plant was not smooth, and production fluctuated greatly. The furnace masters and workers of nearby blast furnaces proactively formed a "three-way combination" team to conduct on-site "consultations" and worked with the workers of blast furnace No. 3 to unify the operation of the three shifts, change the charging system, and adjust the gas distribution. As a result, the daily output level of blast furnace No. 3 increased sharply by more than 200 tons. In the refractory material factory, the first section of the molding workshop sometimes affected the production of the second section due to the shortage of raw materials. The workers of the second section overcame their own difficulties and proactively extracted more than a dozen workers to collect scattered waste mud billets and waste materials and sent them to the first section, ensuring the double leap forward in the production of both upper and lower processes.

### 职工攻困难破关键方便送给别人  连破生产薄弱环节消灭设备隐患

    职工攻困难破关键方便送给别人  连破生产薄弱环节消灭设备隐患
    新华社鞍山30日电　鞍山钢铁公司各单位职工在今年最后一个季度的生产中，处处送方便，人人夺困难，以平炉为中心全面大协作，齐心协力地促进钢铁生产步步上升。
    10月份以来，各厂矿职工开展了“看谁为钢服务得周、全、早、好”的竞赛，纷纷做到平炉要什么就给什么，什么时候要就什么时候送到，保证平炉优质高产。他们都主动地了解别人需要，把方便送上门，把困难带回来。直接为各钢厂服务的炼铁厂，从七月份以来，就组织了有厂长、技术人员、炉长和工人参加的“三结合”访问团，每星期访问各钢厂一次。这个工厂的领导干部每天还轮流参加炼钢厂的生产会议，及时摸清平炉的需要。因而，逐步做到了平炉炼什么钢种，高炉就给什么铁水。为了保证平炉快速炼钢所需要的优质铁水，炼铁厂各高炉工人努力提高技术，绝大部分高炉已基本上消灭了高硫铁，这就使平炉熔炼时间随之缩短。以大搞协作著名的第一炼钢厂，整模、运转、平炉三个方面实行大协作，消灭了长期以来平炉等待钢锭模的现象。第二炼钢厂职工由于上下左右紧密配合，11月中旬全厂每炉钢平均熔炼时间，由10月下旬的十三小时十四分，降低到十一小时二十四分。
    由于工人们进一步发扬了抢困难、夺关键的共产主义精神，许多生产薄弱环节接连被突破，设备隐患在萌芽时期就被消灭。十八号平炉是第二炼钢厂的快速炼钢标兵炉，11月份到20日止，这座平炉的平均熔炼时间已缩短到九小时零三分钟。可是最近这座炉子的南北两端水套分别结了两个渣包，阻碍煤气流通，严重地影响了快速炼钢。甲班炉长马力祥立即组织本班工人突击吹水套，这一天虽然他们的熔炼时间略高一点，但是由于他们及时消除了两个水套隐患，炉子特别好使，因此丁班工人用六小时四十五分钟就炼出一炉钢，创造了今年以来快速炼钢的最高纪录。而这座平炉当天的平均熔炼时间也不到八小时。11月上旬，炼钢厂三号高炉炉况不顺，生产波动大，附近几座高炉的炉长和工人就主动组成“三结合”小组，进行现场“会诊”，并和三号高炉工人一道统一三班操作，改变装料制度，调节煤气分布。结果，三号高炉日产水平猛增二百多吨。耐火材料厂成型第一工段，由于原料供不应求，有时要影响第二工段的生产，第二工段的工人就克服本身的困难，主动抽出十几名工人搜集点滴废泥坯和废料，送给第一工段，保证了上下工序的生产双双跃进。
