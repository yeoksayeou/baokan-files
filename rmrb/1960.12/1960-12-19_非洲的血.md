    African Blood
    Yuan Ying
    There's a photo in the newspaper: Algerians are marching in Algiers, holding up signs demanding independence.
    Such photos are common in newspapers and not particularly special. But this photo made me stare for a long time. From those excited faces, I seemed to be transported to the boiling streets of Algiers, to the Casbah district tightly surrounded by French military police; there, people faced the machine guns and grenade launchers of French imperialism, waving the flag of the Algerian Republic, solemnly vowing: "Rather die unyielding than surrender, fight to the end!" From the earth-shattering shouts, I heard the beating of the hearts of the demonstrators. Through the particularly large French letters of "Independence" on that sign, I saw a patch of crimson blood.
    Blood! This is the blood of Algerians spilled in Algiers, Oran, Constantine, and the Sahara Desert; this is the blood of Congolese people spilled in Leopoldville; this is the blood of black Africans spilled in the dense forests; this is the blood of innocent people murdered by the two-legged jackals from the so-called "free world" and "civilized world" wearing white gloves! This is the blood of countless people on the 29 million square kilometers of the African continent, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Cape of Good Hope, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean!
    From the day the European colonialists' boots first stepped on this rich and fertile continent, who can count the blood shed by Africans under the shackles of slavery? The Nile flows day and night, the Congo River flows day and night, the Zambezi River and the Niger River flow day and night, and the blood of the African peoples flows day and night! Please look at some random bits of material I came across:
    "Patrols must rush into villages, occupy them with bayonet fighting, execute all those who dare to resist, capture the residents as prisoners, and plunder livestock. ... In order to deter others by punishing one, Captain Fley ordered twenty women and young children, including nursing infants, to be taken out and bayoneted to death with long guns a few hundred meters from the military camp." (Quoted from *Glory Under Swords and Guns* by the Frenchman V. Docquertant, published in Paris in 1900)
    "Vast areas have been devastated, and all kinds of objects are abandoned everywhere in the weeds and on the paths... Especially the villages are all burned down, and human bones are exposed everywhere." (Quoted from *The Conquerors of Chad* by the Frenchman Menier, published in Paris in 1923)
    These are just a drop in the ocean of the early colonialists' own confessions, and to a large extent they conceal the full truth of the colonialists' crimes. But even from this little bit that has been revealed, can't we still see the green faces and fangs of this group of cannibals? Can't we still smell the bloody stench on the paper? For more than a hundred years, how many African youths, African women, and children have died under the colonialists' long guns and bayonets, how much African blood has soaked the soil of their hometowns, and how many villages and huts have been reduced to ashes!
    Those colonialists who came to Africa under the guise of "exploration teams" and "patrols" pale in comparison to the cannibalistic deeds of their descendants. The degree of cruelty, insidiousness, and ruthlessness of the new colonialists is simply beyond the reach of their predecessors. In Algeria, de Gaulle mobilized armored vehicles, machine guns, cannons, and fully armed executioners, using barbed wire to tightly surround the Muslim residential areas of Algiers and using helicopters to release tear gas. In the Congo, new and old colonialism united to carry out the most despicable and shameless acts, plunging this young republic into darkness and slaughtering the Congolese people. In Cameroon, in Nyasaland, in South Africa, in all the places on the African continent where colonial chains still shackle people's necks, bloody struggles are taking place.
    However, how can blood frighten people who are awakening day by day! More than two thousand years ago, the Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu said, "The people do not fear death, so how can you scare them with death!" He said this from the standpoint of maintaining the interests of the rulers, but it did speak the truth. Philips fell, and the Algerian people continue to fight; Moumié fell, and the Cameroonian people are moving forward even more bravely. Without machine guns and cannons, Algerian fighters wield rifles and spears; without armored vehicles, Katangans raise bows and arrows. Blood brightens people's eyes; blood ignites people's fighting spirit. The 230 million Africans are filled with the fighting spirit and determination like erupting volcanoes and surging waves!
    "Life is precious,
    Love is worth even more,
    But for the sake of freedom,
    Both can be thrown away!"
    These are the famous lines of the Hungarian patriotic poet Petőfi. It has inspired countless revolutionary heroes to sing aloud and march to the battlefield. Yin Fu, the Communist Party member who introduced this poem to China, also shed his blood in Longhua Prison for the proletarian revolutionary cause. Mr. Lu Xun once praised it as the "blood of the pioneers" of Chinese proletarian revolutionary literature. The blood of the pioneers always illuminates the way forward for those who come after. Now on the African continent, thousands upon thousands of awakened warriors, for the sake of freedom and independence, have abandoned love, abandoned life, and shed the blood of the pioneers of the liberation of Africa.
    "Blood debts must be repaid with the same thing. The longer the delay, the greater the interest that must be paid!" (Lu Xun) The day has come for the African people to settle accounts with imperialism and all new and old colonialists. Those who dare to advance in blood and fight in blood will surely achieve victory in blood. "The colonial system in Africa is collapsing." "The independence of hundreds of millions of people in Asia, Africa and other parts of the world is what they have won in their fierce struggle against imperialism." (*Statement of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of All Countries*) The blood of Africa tolls the death knell for all new and old colonialism. Just like the newborn phoenix born in the flames, a free, independent, and liberated Africa will surely stand tall in the struggle of the African people who advance wave upon wave!

    非洲的血
    袁鹰
    报纸上有一张照片：阿尔及利亚人在阿尔及尔的大街上举行游行示威，示威队伍高举着要求独立的标语前进。
    这样的照片，在报上是常见的，并不怎么特别。但是这张照片却使我凝视了好久。从那一张张激动的脸庞上，我仿佛来到了沸腾的阿尔及尔街头，来到了被法国军警密密包围的卡斯巴区；那里，人们面对着法帝国主义的机关枪和掷弹筒，挥动着阿尔及利亚共和国的国旗，庄严地宣誓：“宁死不屈，斗争到底！”从震动天地的喊声里，我听到了示威人群的心的跳动。透过那幅标语上“独立”这个写得特别大的法文字母，我却看到了一片殷红的血。
    血！这是洒在阿尔及尔、奥兰、君士坦丁和撒哈拉沙漠里的阿尔及利亚人的血，这是洒在利奥波德维尔的刚果人的血，这是洒在密林里的黑非洲人的血，这是被来自所谓“自由世界”、“文明世界”的戴着白手套的两脚豺狼们杀害的无辜者的血！这是从地中海到好望角、从大西洋到印度洋的二千九百多万方公里非洲大陆上千千万万人的血！
    从欧洲殖民者的皮靴第一天踏上这块丰饶肥沃的大陆起，非洲人在奴隶的枷锁下流下的鲜血，谁能数得清？尼罗河日夜在流，刚果河日夜在流，三比西河和尼日尔河日夜在流，非洲各民族的血也是日夜在流啊！请看下面一些随手翻到的点滴材料：
    “巡逻队必须冲进村庄，用白刃战去占领它，对所有敢于抵抗的人一律处死，将居民捉来当俘虏，并抢掠牲畜。……为了惩一儆百，孚莱上尉就命令拉出二十个妇女和幼龄及哺乳的小孩，在距离军营几百米的地点把她们用长枪全部刺死。”（引自法国人维?·道克东著的《刀枪下的光荣》，1900年巴黎出版）
    “广大的地区受到了蹂躏，在野草中，在小径上，到处抛弃各种各样物件……尤其是村庄全部烧毁了，四处露出人的骨骼。”（引自法国人梅尼埃著《乍得的征服者》，1923年巴黎出版）
    这些只不过是那些早期的殖民者的自供中的沧海一粟，而且在很大程度上掩盖了殖民者罪行的全部真相。但即使这透露出来的一点点，我们不是仍然可以见到这群吃人者的青面獠牙、不是仍然可以闻到满纸的血腥气么？一百多年了，多少非洲的青年、非洲的妇女和儿童，死在殖民主义的长枪和刺刀下，多少非洲人的血浸透了家乡的泥土，多少村庄和茅屋化为灰烬！
    那些挂着“考察团”、“巡逻队”幌子到非洲来的殖民者，比起他们的后代的吃人勾当，实在太相形见拙。新的殖民者，残酷、阴险和狠毒的程度，简直不是他们的前辈所能及得上于万一。在阿尔及利亚，戴高乐出动了装甲车、机关枪、大炮和全副武装的刽子手，用铁丝网严密包围阿尔及尔的穆斯林住区，用直升飞机施放催泪瓦斯。在刚果，新老殖民主义联合起来，干着最卑鄙无耻的行径，把这个年青的共和国搞得暗无天日，屠杀着刚果人民。在喀麦隆，在尼亚萨兰，在南非，在非洲大陆上所有殖民锁链还锁住人们脖子的地方，血的搏斗正在进行着。
    然而，鲜血又怎么能吓得住正在一天天觉醒的人民！两千多年前，我国哲学家老子说过，“民不畏死，奈何以死惧之！”他是站在维护统治者利益的立场上说的，但也确实说出了真实。菲利浦斯倒下去了，阿尔及利亚人民继续在战斗；穆米埃倒下去了，喀麦隆人民更勇敢地向前。没有机关枪大炮，阿尔及利亚战士挥舞着步枪长矛；没有装甲车，加丹加人举起了弓箭。血，擦亮了人们的眼睛；血，燃起了人们的斗志。两亿三千万非洲人，有的是像爆发的火山、像汹涌的浪涛一样的斗志和决心！
    “生命诚可贵，
    爱情价更高，
    若为自由故，
    二者皆可抛！”
    这是匈牙利爱国诗人裴多菲的名句。它曾经鼓舞了无数革命志士慷慨高歌地走上战场。把这首诗介绍到中国来的共产党员殷夫，也为了无产阶级的革命事业，血洒龙华监狱。鲁迅先生曾经歌颂为中国无产阶级革命文学的“前驱的血”。前驱的血，总是为后来者照亮了前进的道路。现在在非洲大陆上，成千上万的觉醒了的战士，为了自由独立，抛弃了爱情，抛弃了生命，流下了解放非洲的前驱的血。
    “血债必须用同物偿还。拖欠得愈久，就要付更大的利息！”（鲁迅）非洲人民向帝国主义、向一切新老殖民者算总账的日子来到了。敢于在血泊里前进、在血泊里斗争的，一定能在血泊里得到胜利。“非洲的殖民主义制度正在崩溃。”“亚洲、非洲和世界其他地区亿万人的独立，是他们在同帝国主义进行残酷的搏斗中争取到的。”（《各国共产党和工人党代表会议声明》）非洲的血，敲响了一切新老殖民主义的丧钟。就像烈火里诞生新生的凤凰一样，自由、独立、解放的非洲，一定在非洲人民前仆后继的斗争里屹然地站起来！
