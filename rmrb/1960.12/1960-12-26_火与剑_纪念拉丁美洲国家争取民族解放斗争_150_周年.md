Fire and Sword
    ——Commemorating the 150th Anniversary of the National Liberation Struggles of Latin American Countries
    Zheng Ge
    In the mid-16th century, a Spanish missionary named Bartolomé de las Casas, who had spent most of his life in the Americas, lamented that military force could not conquer Latin Americans. Therefore, in his report to the Spanish government, he proposed a policy of "appeasement." He was in the same league as those bloodthirsty pirates. This man was later appointed as the "Protector of the Indians," a special envoy to supervise the colonists in implementing the "appeasement" policy. However, his reports also revealed the crimes of the conquerors. For example, he wrote:
    When the Spanish entered the Indian settlements, the old, the children, and the women became victims of their rampage; they did not even spare pregnant women, splitting open their bellies with spears or swords. They drove the Indians into enclosures like sheep, competing to see who could more skillfully split an Indian in half with one blow, or tear out his entrails. They snatched infants from their mothers' arms, grabbed their little legs, and smashed their heads against stones, or threw them into the nearest river, saying, "Now you can cool off!"... Indian chiefs were treated even more cruelly, being nailed to wooden fences and then burned with slow fire.
    From the time the colonialists set foot on the Americas in the late 15th century, this continent became a world of corpses and rivers of blood. The pirates' various atrocities of massacre, hanging, burning, dismemberment, and burying alive are too numerous to mention. Even the aforementioned hypocritical missionary had to admit: "Someone did tell me that a ship sailing from Hispaniola (i.e., the island of Haiti) to the Lucayas could navigate without a compass, simply by watching the floating corpses on the sea." This is the epitome of the old colonialists' rule over Latin America for more than three hundred years. Some say that the history of Latin America is a history of the colonialists' fire and sword, and this is absolutely true.
    However, the colonial masters' whips and bayonets could not suppress the awakening of the slaves. One hundred and fifty years ago, in 1810, the independence struggles in various parts of Latin America, rising one after another, finally converged into a surging torrent. From Mexico to Argentina, from the West Indies to the east coast of the Pacific, the Latin American people raised high the torch of independence to confront the colonialists' evil fire, and raised the sword of freedom to resist the colonialists' butcher knife. With fire against fire, with sword against sword, Spain's throne in Latin America was finally smashed and thrown into the rolling waves of the Atlantic Ocean.
    The jackals left through the front door, and the tigers entered through the back door. The Latin American people drove away the old Spanish colonialism, but were then ridden on the neck by U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism in Latin America is still a history of fire and sword. In 1823, it put forward the notorious "Monroe Doctrine," wanting to monopolize the fat of Latin America; in 1848, it seized two million square kilometers of Mexican territory; in 1898, it marched into Cuba and Puerto Rico; in 1903, it occupied the Isthmus of Panama; in the 1920s and 1930s, it occupied Haiti and Nicaragua, placing many Central and South American countries under its armed surveillance. In the eyes of the bosses on Wall Street, it seemed that Cuban sugarcane, Chilean copper and saltpeter, Venezuelan oil, Brazilian coffee, cocoa and cotton, Mexican silver, Colombian platinum, Guyanese bauxite... all of Latin America's abundant resources, along with the sovereignty of these countries, did not belong to the people, but should all be recorded on the asset bills of New York's wealthy families.
    The Latin American people clearly recognize the faces of these new colonialists. Just as the Latin American proverb says: "A monkey is still a monkey, even if it wears silk." Whether U.S. imperialism uses armed occupation in the name of protection, or carries out economic plunder under the guise of "aid to underdeveloped countries," or uses "Good Neighbor Policy" to prettify itself, it is all the same: tightening the Latin American people's belts even further, and draining their blood even drier.
    What do the Latin American people use to counter this? Still fire against fire, sword against sword! They inherit the fighting tradition of the Latin American people for four hundred years, daring to adopt various methods and means of struggle, armed and unarmed, against the powerful enemy—U.S. imperialism—until the overthrow of the reactionary rule of imperialists and colonialists.
    Eighty or ninety years ago, the great Brazilian poet Castro Alves passionately sang an ode to the revolutionaries:
    Let the steep canyons and cliffs tremble,
    Let the sky, pregnant with mountain rain and
      impending thunder, tremble,
    A group of heroes, like swift winds, are rushing
      past,
    They ride on steeds with flying manes, struggling
      forward,
    Holding these shining silver swords in their
      hands and brandishing them,
    Sharpening their swords on the tombstones of
      their ancestors.
    Yes, mountain rain is coming, and thunder is imminent. This can also be used as a portrayal of the current anti-American struggles of the people of various Latin American countries. Heroes holding high the banner of national liberation are "rushing past," and the "struggling forward steeds" pushing the revolutionary struggle to a new peak are galloping across that green continent. The wind and rain are dark, but the cock crows incessantly. The dawn on the Caribbean Sea has illuminated the entire land from the Gulf of Mexico to the Drake Passage.
     "Today, in the struggle for a liberated Latin America, in the face of the subservience of those who have usurped official representation, the voice of the true people resounds with irresistible force, a voice that comes from the depths of its coal and tin mines, from its factories and sugar mills, from its lands subjected to feudal rule. There, the Roto, the Gaucho, the Jívaro – the successors of Zapata and Sandino – have taken up the weapons of freedom. This cry echoes in their poetry and novels, resonates in the hearts of their students, women, children, and their sleepless old people." (Havana Declaration)
    Latin America is no longer a "backyard" where Wall Street financial oligarchs and arms dealers can do whatever they want! "A front for actively carrying out anti-imperialist struggles has been opened in Latin America." (Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties) We have already seen the increasingly fierce torches on this front, and we have already heard the increasingly loud drums!
    Cubans like to say: "We will win!" This has become the common slogan of the 190 million people on the Latin American continent. Is this just a slogan? No, it is also a truth! The struggle of one hundred and fifty years ago proved this truth, and countless historical facts, past and present, also prove this truth. One hundred and fifty years ago, the Latin American people used inferior weapons to drive away the old colonialism. One hundred and fifty years later, the Latin American people will certainly raise the fire and sword even higher, and use even stronger struggles to resist the more cruel and more greedy new colonialism—American imperialism and its running dogs, facing the east wind of ten thousand miles, standing proudly!

    火与剑
    ——纪念拉丁美洲国家争取民族解放斗争150周年
    郑歌
    十六世纪中叶，有一个在美洲度过大半生、名叫巴托罗美·德·拉斯—卡萨斯的西班牙传教士，感慨于用武力并不能征服拉丁美洲人，因而在他呈交西班牙政府的报告中，提出了“怀柔”主张。他同那些杀人不眨眼的海盗们是一丘之貉。此人后来被任命为“印第安人保护官”，即监督殖民者们执行“怀柔”政策的钦差大臣。但是在他那些报告中，也透露出征服者的罪行。比如他写道：
    当西班牙人进入印第安人居住地时，老人、儿童和妇女就成了他们逞凶肆虐的牺牲品；他们甚至连孕妇也不饶过，用标枪或剑剖开他们的肚子，他们像赶羊似地把印第安人赶进围栅里，互相比赛，看谁能更灵巧地把一个印第安人一下子劈成两半，或者把他的内脏剜出到外面来。他们把婴儿从母亲怀抱里夺过来，抓住他们的小腿，把他们的脑袋往石头上砸碎，或者把他们扔到就近的河里去，一边说道：“你们该凉快一下啦！”……遭到更残酷对待的是印第安首领，他们被钉架在木栅栏上，然后用慢火来烧。
    从殖民主义者在十五世纪末期踏上美洲开始，这块大陆上就成为伏尸遍野、血流成渠的世界。那班海盗们的屠杀、吊打、火烧、腰斩、活埋的各种暴行，真是罄竹难书。连上述那个伪善的传教士也不得不承认：“有人确实告诉我说：一条船从伊士班诺拉（即海地岛）开往卢加伊斯，可以不用罗盘，只要看海面上飘荡的浮尸就可以航行了。”这就是老牌殖民主义者统治拉丁美洲三百多年的缩影。有人说，拉丁美洲的历史是一部殖民者的火与剑的历史，这是一点也不错的。
    但是，殖民老爷的皮鞭和刺刀，压不住奴隶的觉醒。一百五十年前，即1810年，拉丁美洲各地此伏彼起的独立斗争，终于汇集成汹涌澎湃的怒潮。从墨西哥到阿根廷，从西印度群岛到东太平洋沿岸，拉丁美洲人民高高地举起了要求独立的火把来对待殖民者罪恶的火，举起争取自由的剑来抗击殖民者的屠刀。以火对火，以剑对剑，西班牙在拉丁美洲的宝座终于被打得粉碎，扔进大西洋的滚滚波涛。
    前门去了豺狼，后门进了老虎。拉丁美洲人民赶走了西班牙老牌殖民主义，却又被美帝国主义骑在脖子上。美帝国主义在拉丁美洲，仍然是一部火与剑的历史。1823年，它提出了臭名昭著的“门罗主义”，想独霸拉丁美洲这块肥肉；1848年，它夺走了墨西哥二百万平方公里土地；1898年，它开进了古巴和波多黎各；1903年，它霸占了巴拿马地峡；二十年代到三十年代，它占领了海地、尼加拉瓜，把中南美许多国家都放在它的武装监视之下。在华尔街的老板们看来，仿佛古巴的甘蔗，智利的铜和硝石，委内瑞拉的石油，巴西的咖啡、可可和棉花，墨西哥的银，哥伦比亚的白金，圭亚那的铁矾土……一切拉丁美洲的丰饶的资源，连同这些国家的主权，都不属于人民，而是都应该记在纽约豪门的资产账单上。
    拉丁美洲人民对这帮新殖民主义者的面目是认识清楚的。正像拉丁美洲的谚语说的：“猴子就是披上绸缎，还是猴子。”不管美帝国主义以保护为名的武装占领也罢，以“援助不发达国家”做幌子实行经济掠夺也罢，以“睦邻政策”来为自己涂脂抹粉也罢，反正都是一回事：把拉丁美洲人的肚带勒得更紧些，把拉丁美洲人的血抽得更干些。
    拉丁美洲人用什么来对付？还是以火对火，以剑对剑！他们继承了四百年来拉丁美洲人民的战斗传统，敢于向强大的敌人——美帝国主义采取各种各样的斗争方法、方式，武装的和非武装的，一直到推翻帝国主义者、殖民主义者的反动统治。
    八、九十年前，巴西的伟大诗人卡斯特罗·阿尔维斯曾经热情洋溢地高唱过对革命者的颂歌：
    让峻峭的峡谷和悬崖颤抖吧，
    让山雨欲来雷鸣在即的天空颤
      抖吧，
    一群疾风似的英雄正在飞驰而
      过，
    他们骑着鬃毛飞扬、奋力前进
      的骏马，
    把这些银光雪亮的利剑拿在手
      里挥舞，
    把剑放在自己祖先的墓石上拭
      磨。
    是的，山雨欲来，雷鸣在即，这也可以作为当前拉丁美洲各国人民反美斗争的写照。高举着民族解放大旗的英雄们“正在飞驰而过”，把革命斗争推向新的高峰的“奋力前进的骏马”，正在那个绿色大陆上驰骋。风雨如晦，鸡鸣不已，加勒比海上的曙光，已经照亮了整个从墨西哥湾直到德拉克海峡的土地。
      “今天，在争取一个解放的拉丁美洲的斗争中，面对那些篡夺了官方代表权的人们的唯唯诺诺，真正的人民的声音以不可抗拒的声势震响着，这种声音来自它的煤矿和锡矿的内部，来自它的工厂和制糖厂，来自它的遭受封建统治的土地。在那里，罗托丘洛人、高丘人、希瓦罗人—萨帕塔和桑地诺的后继者们拿起了自由的武器。这种呼声在他们的诗歌里和小说里回响着，在他们的学生、妇女、孩子和他们的未能安眠的老人的心中共鸣着。”（《哈瓦那宣言》）
    拉丁美洲，再不是华尔街金融寡头和军火商们可以为所欲为的“后院”了！“在拉丁美洲开辟了积极进行反帝斗争的战线。”（《各国共产党和工人党代表会议声明》）我们已经看到了这个战线上的越来越猛烈的火炬，我们已经听到了越来越响亮的鼓声！
    古巴人爱说：“我们必胜！”这已经成为拉丁美洲大陆上一亿九千万人民共同的口号。这仅仅是一句口号吗？不，它也是一个真理！一百五十年前的斗争，证明了这个真理，古往今来数不尽的历史事实，也证明了这个真理。一百五十年前，拉丁美洲人民曾经用低劣的武器赶走了老牌的殖民主义，一百五十年后的今天，拉丁美洲人民一定把火和剑举得更高，用更加坚强的斗争抗击更加残酷、更加贪婪的新殖民主义——美国帝国主义和它的走狗们，迎着万里东风，昂然地站立起来！
