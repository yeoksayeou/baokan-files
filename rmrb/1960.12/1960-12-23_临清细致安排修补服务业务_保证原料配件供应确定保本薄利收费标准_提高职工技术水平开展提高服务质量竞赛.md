(Reported by this newspaper from Jinan on the 22nd) The industrial and commercial departments of Linqing City, Shandong Province, rationally divide labor and cooperate closely to carry out repair and service businesses, making every effort to facilitate people's lives.

The industrial and commercial departments of Linqing City, based on the needs of the masses, conducted an overall plan for the repair and service business, and under the guidance of the ideology of "having division of labor, no boundaries, rushing to work, and giving convenience," appropriately divided the scope of operations: general small furniture repairs were the responsibility of the industrial departments; repairs of daily necessities were the responsibility of the commercial departments. On this basis, they made unified adjustments and additions to service outlets and staffing. Those suitable for centralized operation were centrally operated, and those suitable for decentralized activities were decentralized, making every effort to facilitate the masses. The commercial department established fourteen bicycle repair shops in the city center. The steamer cage factory, bamboo ware factory, and fur factory undertook repair services while focusing on production. At the same time, street craftsmen were organized, establishing four record player and radio repair shops, three watch and glasses repair shops, thirty-four shoe repair stalls, and four mobile soldering teams. In rural areas, in addition to organizing one hundred and forty-three commune-run factories to be responsible for the repair of small furniture, in combination with the commune and team's sideline production, thirty-four mobile teams were organized for mending pots, sawing basins, and sawing bowls. The business personnel of the commercial department universally carried out the activity of "selling what they can repair," and in addition to establishing fourteen daily necessities repair shops, some stores also established repair counters.

Timely organization of the supply of raw materials, parts, and accessories is an important link in carrying out the repair business. In order to solve this problem, the industrial and commercial departments, in accordance with the spirit of self-reliance and state supply combined, adopted the following methods: ① For materials that are uniformly distributed and planned by the state, plans are compiled regularly, which are arranged in a unified way by the commercial department with priority supply; ② Small materials and accessories that can be produced locally are arranged for production and organized for supply; ③ The repair industry universally links up with factories, making full use of scraps and waste materials. ④ Activities of "repairing what is received as raw materials" are universally carried out, tapping the potential of social materials; ⑤ Carrying out repair services with materials, and paying attention to saving materials. Through the above measures, the raw material needs for repair are basically guaranteed.

In carrying out the repair business, the repair industry workers in the city have been making every effort to improve technology and improve the quality of repairs. Methods such as large factories leading service stations, masters leading apprentices, inviting teachers to teach, and going out to learn from experience have been adopted to improve the technical level of repairs, and a large number of new technical personnel have been trained. With the improvement of technology and the increase of technical personnel, the city's repair service items have increased to 234, an increase of 33% compared with the same period last year, and the quality of repairs has been improved.

The repair business has a wide variety of items and complex specifications. How to stipulate a reasonable price is a matter of concern to the vital interests of the masses. Therefore, from the point of view of promoting social economy, the city has determined the principle of cost-effective and low-profit pricing, and specifically controlled it according to different situations. For example, mending pots, repairing shoes, repairing bicycles, dismantling old and renovating, etc., involve a wide range of aspects and can greatly promote social economy when widely carried out, so low fees are determined. Repairing locks, sawing bowls, sharpening knives, sharpening scissors, repairing umbrellas, etc., use very few materials and the technology is simple, so it is determined that there is a slight profit. The repair of general high-end consumer goods has more complex technology, and the fee level is slightly higher. In order to facilitate mass supervision, items with fixed labor, countable materials, and roughly the same specifications are subject to marked prices. For projects with complex specifications and different materials, the price is determined by mutual agreement between the parties to achieve mutual satisfaction.

At present, the workers in the repair industry in the city's industrial and commercial departments have universally launched a competition movement with good service attitude, good repair quality, reasonable prices, convenience to the masses, and quick collection and delivery. All units have adopted a variety of methods to facilitate the masses according to their own business characteristics. The Mass Service Station of the Commercial Bureau implements door-to-door service for scattered small repairs; umbrella and rubber shoe repairs are collected separately and repaired centrally; the rural areas of sawing basins, sawing bowls, repairing locks, and tying brooms, etc., all adopt the method of carrying them on their shoulders and going through the hutongs; printing and dyeing, clothing, cotton ginning and other related units have adopted a one-stop large-scale cooperation method for receiving, dismantling, washing, dyeing, fluffing, and making, so that customers can get it done at one time. Since the second half of the year, the city has repaired 140,000 pieces of small furniture and daily necessities for the masses, which has been praised by the masses. (Attached picture)

    临清市的工业和商业部门，根据群众需要，对修补服务业务进行了通盘规划，并在有分工，无界限，抢工作，让方便的思想指导下，适当划分了经营范围：一般的小家具修配，由工业部门负责；日用品的修配，由商业部门负责。在此基础上，他们对服务网点设置和人员配备，进行了统一的调整和充实。适于集中经营的集中经营，适于分散活动的分散活动，千方百计便利群众。商业部门在市中心区设立了十四处自行车修理门市，笼屉厂、竹器厂、皮毛厂，在搞好生产的同时，接收修配业务。同时，还把街道上的手工艺人组织起来，建立了修唱机和收音机门市四个，修表和眼镜门市三个，修鞋摊三十四个，焊壶流动挑四个。在农村，除组织一百四十三个社办工厂负责小家具的修配以外，结合社、队副业生产，组织了补锅、锯盆、锯碗流动挑三十四副。商业部门的营业人员，普遍开展了卖什么，修什么的活动，除建立了十四处日用品修配门市部以外，部分商店还建立了修配柜台。
    及时组织原材料和零件、配件的供应，是开展修配业务的重要环节。为了解决这个问题，工业和商业部门按照自力更生和国家供应相结合的精神，采取了如下办法：①凡国家统一分配，计划供应的物资，定期编造计划，由商业部门统筹安排，优先供应；②当地能够生产的小材料、配件，就地安排生产，组织供应；③修补行业普遍与工厂挂钩，充分利用下脚废料。④普遍开展修什么，收什么原料的活动，挖掘社会物资潜力；⑤开展带料修配业务，并注意节约用料。通过上述措施，基本上保证了修配原料需要。
    在开展修配业务中，这个市的修配行业的职工，千方百计改进技术，提高修配质量。采取以大工厂带服务站、以师带徒、请师传授、外出取经等方法，使修配技术水平普遍提高，并培养了大量新的技术人员。随着技术的提高和技术人员的增加，全市修配服务项目已增加到二百三十四种，比去年同期增加了33％，并提高了修配质量。
