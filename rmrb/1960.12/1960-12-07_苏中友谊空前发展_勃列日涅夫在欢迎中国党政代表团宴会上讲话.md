    Dear Comrades, Friends! Dear Comrade Liu Shaoqi and all esteemed members of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation!
    Today, the glorious city of Minsk—the capital of Soviet Belarus—is welcoming you, the envoys of the great Chinese people, with extreme excitement as the most respected guests and closest brothers.
    The people of Belarus have achieved tremendous successes in economic and cultural construction within the great family of the Soviet peoples. In the post-war years, they have built their cities and villages from ruins and ashes, established modern large-scale industry, and are waging a tenacious struggle for the further upsurge of agriculture.
    The working people of Belarus are loyal patriots of our socialist motherland and active builders of a communist society.
    Please allow me to warmly wish the people of Belarus new victories in the struggle for the victory of communism.
    Dear Chinese comrades, as we cordially welcome you on the land of Belarus, we express our best friendship and affection to the hardworking and courageous Chinese people who, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, have completed profound social transformations in China and are selflessly building socialism.
    The peoples of China and the Soviet Union have been neighbors since ancient times. However, it was only after the victory of the socialist revolution in our two countries that Sino-Soviet friendship achieved unprecedented development, becoming consolidated and unbreakable.
    We give a lofty evaluation to our friendship. It accords with the wishes of the peoples of the Soviet Union and China, strengthens the solidarity and power of the entire socialist camp, and plays a significant role in the victorious struggle of the peoples of all countries against the imperialist plots of aggression and for world peace and a bright future for mankind.
    Due to the solidarity of the socialist countries, their close cooperation in economic and cultural construction, as well as on the international stage, the power of the socialist camp is constantly growing and strengthening. Socialism is constantly winning millions upon millions of people to its side.
    Dear Comrades, our strength will continue to grow in the future.
    The victorious construction of communism, the noble struggle to consolidate world peace, and the development of peaceful cooperation with all countries are the content of all activities of the great Soviet People, our Soviet Government and the glorious Soviet Communist Party and its Central Committee led by the faithful Leninist Comrade Khrushchev.
    Dear Chinese friends!
    Here, in the capital of Belarus, you will have another opportunity to see the sincere friendly feelings that the Soviet people hold for their friends and brothers—the Chinese people.
    Please allow me to propose a toast to the glorious and hardworking people of Belarus!
    To the unbreakable friendship between the two great peoples of the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China!
    To the further strengthening of the solidarity and fraternal friendship of the socialist countries!
    To the health of our dear guest Chairman Liu Shaoqi and all members of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation!

    今天，光荣的明斯克市——苏维埃白俄罗斯首都的劳动人民怀着极其兴奋的心情把你们，伟大中国人民的使者，当作最敬爱的客人和最亲近的兄弟来欢迎。
    白俄罗斯人民在苏联各族人民的大家庭中，在经济和文化建设方面取得了巨大的成就。在战后年代里，他们从废墟和灰烬中建设起了自己的城市和村庄，建立了现代的大工业，为农业的进一步高涨进行着顽强的斗争。
    白俄罗斯的劳动人民是我们社会主义祖国的忠诚的爱国者，共产主义社会的积极建设者。
    请允许我热烈地预祝白俄罗斯人民在为共产主义胜利的斗争中取得新的胜利。
    亲爱的中国同志们，当我们在白俄罗斯的土地上衷心地欢迎你们的时候，我们向在共产党和以毛泽东同志为首的党中央委员会的领导下，在中国完成了深刻的社会改造、忘我地建设着社会主义的勤劳勇敢的中国人民，表示我们最好的友谊和感情。
    苏中两国人民自古以来就是邻居。但是，只是在社会主义革命在我们两国取得了胜利之后，苏中友谊才得到了空前发展，成为巩固的和牢不可破的。
    我们对我们的友谊给予崇高的评价。它符合苏中两国人民的愿望，并使整个社会主义阵营的团结和威力加强，在各国人民反对帝国主义侵略阴谋、争取世界和平和人类美好未来的胜利斗争中起着重大的作用。
    由于社会主义国家的团结，它们在经济和文化建设方面以及在国际舞台上的密切合作，社会主义阵营的威力日益增进和加强。社会主义不断赢得千百万人站在自己方面来。
    亲爱的同志们，我们的力量今后将不断壮大。
    共产主义的胜利建设，争取巩固世界和平的崇高斗争，同各国和平合作的发展，是伟大苏联人民、我们苏联政府、光荣的苏联共产党及其以忠实的列宁主义者赫鲁晓夫同志为首的中央委员会的全部活动的内容。
    亲爱的中国朋友们！
    在这里，在白俄罗斯的首都，你们还有机会再看到苏联人民对自己的朋友和兄弟——中国人民所怀抱的真诚的友好感情。
    请允许我建议，为光荣的、勤劳的白俄罗斯人民干杯！
    为苏联和中华人民共和国两国伟大人民牢不可破的友谊干杯！
    为社会主义国家的团结和兄弟友谊的进一步加强干杯！
  为我们亲爱的客人刘少奇主席和中国党政代表团全体团员的健康干杯！
