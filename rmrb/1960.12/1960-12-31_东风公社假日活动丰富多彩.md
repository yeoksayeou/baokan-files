    Dongfeng Commune's Holiday Activities are Rich and Colorful

    (Our Report) The holiday activities of the Dongfeng People's Commune in Dangshan County, Anhui Province, are rich, colorful, and vibrant. They provide commune members with rest and personal time while also enlivening their lives and powerfully promoting production.

    Since 1958, Dongfeng Commune has established a system of monthly holidays for its members, implementing the spirit of combining work and rest. On holidays, commune members can use the time to rest or handle personal matters. On this day, commercial departments organize forces to deliver goods door-to-door by carrying poles or using carts, and to purchase goods at the households. Banks and credit cooperatives send personnel to commune members' homes to handle deposit and withdrawal procedures. Service industries in the market towns also organize service personnel to go deep into production teams and groups to serve commune members. The commune and brigades also organize commune members who like to speak and sing, as well as local folk artists, to perform various lively and popular art programs (such as Bangzi Opera, Yangqin, drums, cross-talk, poetry contests, etc.) in production teams or market towns, in order to enrich the cultural lives of commune members.

    Party organizations at all levels in Dongfeng Commune attach great importance to promoting and maintaining the holiday system. The commune Party committee determined that the first secretary of the commune Party committee and the secretaries of the brigade Party branches should personally be responsible for this work. In order to carry out holiday activities even better, the commune Party committee successively held on-site meetings in Xieji, Guanzhuang, Caozhuang, Chenzhuang and other brigades where holiday activities were carried out relatively well to exchange experiences.

    For more than two years, because Dongfeng Commune has adhered to the holiday system, commune members have both work and rest, work well, and rest well, and the attendance rate of commune members has greatly improved. (Picture attached)

    东风公社假日活动丰富多彩
    本报讯　安徽砀山县东风人民公社的假日活动内容丰富多彩，有声有色，既使社员有一定的休息和个人活动时间，又活跃了社员的生活，有力地推动了生产。
    东风公社从1958年起就建立了社员每月有假日的制度，贯彻劳逸结合的精神。在假日这一天，社员可以利用这个时间休息或处理一些私人的事情。在这一天里，商业部门组织力量，做到货担、货车送货上门，收购到户，银行和信用部则派人到社员家里办理存款和取款手续，集镇上的服务性行业也组织服务人员深入到生产队、组为社员服务。公社和大队还组织一些爱说、爱唱的社员和当地民间艺人演出各种生动活泼、为广大社员喜闻乐见的文艺节目（如梆子戏、洋琴、大鼓、相声、赛诗等），到生产小队或集镇上演出，以丰富社员的文化生活。
    东风公社各级党的组织对推行、坚持假日制度极为重视。公社党委确定公社党委第一书记、大队党总支书记亲自负责抓这一工作。为了把假日活动开展得更好，公社党委曾先后在假日活动搞得较好的谢集、官庄、曹庄、陈庄等大队召开了现场会议，交流经验。
    两年多来，东风公社由于坚持了假日制度，使社员有劳有逸，劳动得好，休息得好，社员出勤率大大提高。（附图片）
