The Yumen Petroleum Bureau is actively preparing for next year's production. Leading cadres from various factories, departments, and companies, along with workers and technicians, have collectively reviewed and assessed the achievements of this year's technical innovation and technical revolution movement. They summarized 421 new technologies and experiences covering drilling, oil extraction, refining, machinery manufacturing, oilfield construction, transportation, and other aspects. In order to ensure that these new technologies and experiences play a full role in next year's production, each factory and team, under the leadership of the Party committee, has established new technology and experience promotion groups, organized "multi-treasure matching" according to work types, and vigorously promoted them.

With the development of production, the demand for raw materials will continue to increase. Foreseeing this situation, the bureau has adopted various methods to actively produce raw materials and is actively rushing to manufacture and repair accessories for diesel engines, tractors, automobiles, etc. Currently, it has produced more than 10,000 tons of various raw materials such as barite powder, calcium carbide, welding rods, and sulfuric acid. More than 50,000 pieces of various accessories have been rushed for next year. In order to prepare sufficient technical strength for the continued leap forward of the petroleum industry next year, various units have also adopted methods such as short-term refresher courses, on-the-job training, and school training to train a large number of technical workers. The Geological Exploration Company and the Refinery alone have trained more than 3,000 workers of various types using the above methods.

    玉门石油局全面总结新技术经验
    本报讯玉门石油管理局积极为明年生产作准备。各厂、处、公司领导干部和工人、技术人员一道，对今年技术革新和技术革命运动的成果集中进行了审查和鉴定，总结出四百二十一项包括钻井、采油、炼油、机械制造、油田建设、交通运输等各方面的新技术、新经验。为了使这些新技术、新经验在明年的生产中充分发挥作用，各厂队都在党委领导下，成立了新技术、新经验推广组，按工种组织“多宝配套”，大力推广。
    随着生产的发展，原材料的需要量将越来越大。这个局预计到这一形势，采取多种办法积极生产原材料，并积极赶制和修复柴油机、拖拉机、汽车等配件。目前已生产出重晶石粉、电石、电焊条、硫酸等各种原材料一万多吨。为明年赶制的各种配件达五万多件。为了给明年石油工业的持续跃进准备足够的技术力量，各单位还采取短期进修、岗位培训、学校培养等办法，大量培养技术工人。仅地质勘探公司、炼油厂等三个单位，采取上述办法培训的各类工人就达三千多人。
