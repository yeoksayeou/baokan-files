Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 4th: The Second Brigade (basic accounting unit) of the Xinle Management District of the Hongqi Commune in Lezhi County, Sichuan Province, is implementing the principle of voluntary mutual benefit and equivalent exchange, organizing labor and animal power cooperation between small teams to ensure the comprehensive and balanced development of autumn planting work throughout the brigade.

The Second Brigade of Xinle Management District has nine production teams, all of which have implemented the "four fixings of land, labor, draught animals, and farm implements" and established a "three guarantees and one reward" system. During the autumn harvest and planting season, the crop varieties of each team are different, with both dry land and paddy fields, and the maturity periods of the crops also vary, so the busy farming times are not completely consistent; the labor and animal power situations of each team are also unbalanced. In order to seize the season and not miss the farming time, the brigade party branch, based on the requirements of each team, promptly organized them to carry out labor and animal power cooperation activities. Before the start of cooperation, the branch led both parties to negotiate terms and strengthen ideological education to ensure that both parties in the cooperation were voluntary and mutually beneficial, with equivalent exchange, and neither suffered losses.

Under the leadership of the brigade party branch, the cooperation activities between the teams vigorously promoted the autumn planting work. The Ninth Team had a large area of late rice and it matured early, making for a tense harvest, while the neighboring Eighth Team had more dryland crops that had not yet been harvested. The Eighth Team sent four laborers with high threshing skills, bringing threshing bins to participate in the rush harvest of the Ninth Team; when the sweet potatoes of the Eighth Team matured and were harvested, the Ninth Team sent people to return the labor, and both parties were very satisfied. Some farm work required different labor situations, and labor waste was avoided through exchange of labor. For example, the Seventh Team planted a lot of peanuts, and harvesting peanuts was a trivial task that would waste strong labor if they were used. The party branch organized the Ninth Team, whose autumn planting work had been largely completed, to send sixteen and a half semi-able-bodied laborers to support them according to the equivalent labor exchange agreement, allowing the main laborers of the Seventh Team to rush to plant wheat; when it turned to topdressing and managing the wheat, the Seventh Team sent strong laborers to help the Eighth Team carry fertilizer to the fields. In the final stages of the autumn harvest and planting season, the work of the Fifth and Ninth Teams fell behind. The party branch organized the Sixth and Eighth Teams to sign equivalent cooperation contracts with them and went to support them so that they would not miss the farming season.

The harvest of late-maturing spring crops such as cotton, late indica rice, peanuts, and sweet potatoes, and the planting of early spring crops such as wheat, rapeseed, and peas throughout the brigade, which was originally planned to take more than a month, was completed in less than a month through cooperation, and the quality was also very good. In this way, the commune members were able to free up their hands to carry out intercropping, interplanting, and inter-row planting to achieve multiple planting and multiple harvests. Now the entire brigade has used field edges, corners, and crop rows to plant more than 600 mu of various early spring crops. At the same time, the commune members also had ample time to seize the opportunity to topdress and loosen the soil for the early-emerging early spring crops, to achieve early management and good management, and to firmly establish the foundation for a high-yielding summer harvest.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 4th: People's communes in various parts of Sichuan are making rational arrangements for labor under the premise of guaranteeing the completion of contracted production tasks, making full use of field edges, corners, and other idle land to vigorously carry out the "Full Mountain Green" planting expansion movement. According to statistics from only nine special districts and cities, including Nanchong and Dazhou, more than 4 million mu of various grain crops have been additionally planted.

Many areas launched a "Full Mountain Green" planting expansion upsurge as soon as the planting of early spring crops was completed. Many people's communes in Nanchong, Mianyang, and other places took production teams as units and adopted the method of "three-way combination" of cadres, technicians, and experienced farmers to form planting expansion planning groups, combining the inspection of the completion of early spring planting plans, and planned and organized labor to rush to plant plot by plot, mountain by mountain, and ridge by ridge. More than 10,000 planting expansion shock teams organized by the production teams of people's communes in Langzhong County planted more than 210,000 jin of various grain crop seeds and planted more than 3.2 million nests of rapeseed in just three days.

    红旗公社新乐管理区第二大队
    按自愿互利原则组织小队协作大队秋种工作得到了平衡发展
    新华社成都4日电　四川乐至县红旗公社新乐管理区第二大队（基本核算单位）贯彻自愿互利、等价交换的原则，组织小队与小队之间劳力、畜力协作，保证全大队秋种工作全面平衡发展。
    新乐管理区第二大队有九个生产小队，都实行了“土地、劳力、耕畜、农具”四固定和建立了“三包一奖”制度。秋收秋种中，各小队作物品种不一样，有旱地有水田，作物成熟期也有先后，因而农忙时间并不完全一致；各小队劳力、畜力情况也不平衡。为了抢季节，不违农时，大队党支部就根据各小队的要求，及时组织他们开展了劳力、畜力的协作活动。在协作开始前，支部领导双方协商条件，并且加强思想教育，做到协作双方自愿两利，等价交换，互不吃亏。
    在大队党支部领导下开展小队之间的协作活动，有力地促进了秋种工作。九小队晚稻面积大，成熟早，抢收紧张，而邻近的八小队旱地作物多，尚未收获，八小队就派出四个打谷技术高而强的劳动力，带着扮桶到九小队参加抢收；等到八小队旱地作物红苕成熟收获时，九小队派人来还工，双方都很满意。有些农活因为需要劳动力情况不同，通过换工，就避免了劳力的浪费。比如，七小队种的花生多，收获花生是一件琐碎活路，用强劳动力去做会造成窝工浪费。党支部便组织秋种工作已经大部完成的九小队，根据等价换工的协议，派出十六个半劳动力前去支援，让七小队主要劳动力好去抢种小麦；待转入小麦追肥管理时，七小队再派强劳动力帮助八小队挑运肥料下地。在秋收秋种收尾阶段，第五、第九两个小队的工作落在后面，党支部又组织六、八两个小队与他们订立等价协作合同，前往支援，不使他们错过农时。
    全大队迟熟大春作物棉花、晚籼、花生、红苕的收获和小麦、油菜、豌豆等小春作物的播种，原计划需时一个多月，通过协作，不到一个月便提前完成了，质量也很好。这样，社员们就能腾出手来进行增种、间种、套种，实现多种多收。现在全大队已利用田边地角、作物行间种下各种小春作物六百多亩。同时，社员们也有了充裕时间，抓紧对早出土的小春作物进行追肥、松土，实现早管、管好，把夏收高产根子扎稳。
    据新华社成都4日电　四川各地人民公社生产小队在保证完成包产任务的前提下，合理安排劳力，充分利用田边地角和其他闲散土地，大搞“满山青”增种运动。仅据南充、达县等九个专区和市的统计，已增种各种粮食作物四百多万亩。
    许多地区在小春作物播种刚一结束，就掀起了“满山青”增种热潮。南充、绵阳等地许多人民公社都以生产小队为单位，采取干部、技术员、老农“三结合”的办法，组成增种规划小组，结合检查小春播种计划完成情况，逐田逐块，逐山逐岭地边规划边组织劳力抢种。阆中县各人民公社生产小队组织的一万多个增种突击队，仅三天时间就增种各种粮食作物种子二十一万多斤，栽油菜三百二十多万窝。
