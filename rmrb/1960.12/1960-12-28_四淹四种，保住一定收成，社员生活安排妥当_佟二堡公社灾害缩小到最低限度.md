Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Tong'erb堡 People's Commune in Liaoyang City, Liaoning Province, which suffered from an extraordinarily severe flood this year, the worst in a century, has vigorously organized the affected production brigades to carry out a production and disaster relief campaign with the support of the Party and the state, transforming the face of the disaster area in two months. Now, some villages that were destroyed by the flood more than two months ago have been completely rebuilt, and every family has a house to live in. Stacks of firewood and grass are piled up in front of and behind the houses, and every home is warm. The public canteens are even more lively. Everyone has cotton-padded coats, trousers, shoes, and hats, dressed warmly, and happily engaged in labor, rest, and study.

The great victory of the Tong'erb堡 People's Commune in the struggle against the disaster fully demonstrates the incomparable superiority of the socialist system and the people's communes. The flood in 1929 before liberation was smaller than this year's, but that year, according to the statistics of Jinshagou Brigade alone, out of more than two hundred households, more than ninety households had very difficult lives after the disaster, fifty-five households worked for landlords, sixteen households fled to other places to escape famine, and seven households begged along the streets. This year's flood was much larger than in 1929, and because the disaster was too serious, the commune's grain production was reduced by more than 80%. However, thanks to the leadership of the Party, the assistance of the state, and the large-scale public ownership of the people's communes, the people's strength to overcome disasters has been greatly enhanced. After the disaster, more than 10,000 households in the commune did not flee to other places, no one begged along the streets, no one died of illness or starvation, and production and life were properly arranged.

The Tong'erb堡 People's Commune, located on the plain in the middle reaches of the Taizi River, was one of the communes most severely affected by the extraordinarily severe flood in eastern Liaoning in June this year. Thirty-two of the thirty-three production brigades in the commune were affected. 85% of the farmland was flooded, and 60% yielded no harvest. Many houses were washed away and collapsed. Livestock and farm implements also suffered considerable losses. However, after two or three months of struggle against the disaster by the vast number of commune members, the face of the disaster area has been rapidly changed. As winter approached, when reporters visited this severely affected commune, they saw that the crops replanted after the disaster had all been harvested, the newly ploughed land exuded fragrance, and patches of winter wheat had already emerged. The sound of threshing machines and rollers could be heard constantly in the village, and commune members were happily threshing grain on the threshing grounds, which were surrounded by stacks of straw.

The main reason why the Tong'erb堡 Commune was able to overcome such a major natural disaster and minimize the impact was that all the production brigades and the vast number of commune members promptly launched a struggle against the disaster. As soon as the flood receded, the production brigades, under the leadership of the commune Party committee and the brigade Party branches, concentrated all their efforts on restoring production and launched a high tide of draining water to save seedlings and rush harvesting and planting. More than 13,000 mu of submerged crops were rescued, and more than 4,500 mu of waterlogged corn were harvested. In order to make up for the loss of grain production, all the brigades actively expanded the planting area of autumn vegetables. If they were flooded once, they would replant them. Many brigades planted four times after being flooded four times, and a total of more than 2,700 mu of autumn vegetables were replanted. During the rush planting campaign, the commune provided strong support to the disaster-stricken brigades. For example, the brigades generally lacked seeds when rushing to plant autumn vegetables, and the staff of the commune's supply and marketing department used shoulder poles to transport 60,000 jin of vegetable seeds to the production brigades in a timely manner. In addition, the commune promptly sent people to the disaster-stricken brigades to repair the boiler engines and diesel engines that had been damaged by the floods.

During the autumn harvest, the brigades concentrated their superior forces to carry out a mass movement of "meticulous harvesting and threshing, every grain returned home, no leaf discarded, every blade of grass returned to the stack." Because of the focus on drainage and seedling support, rush harvesting and planting, and meticulous harvesting and threshing, the commune harvested more than 2.6 million jin of grain and more than 5.8 million jin of vegetables, strengthening the material basis for resisting disasters and overcoming famine. After the disaster, the production teams focused on canteen work and properly arranged for commune members to spend the winter. Under the leadership of the first secretary of the commune Party committee, many brigade Party branch secretaries personally went to the kitchen to improve the canteen. Now, the number of Red Flag canteens in the commune has increased from nine before the disaster to twenty. The canteens have stored more than 5.5 million jin of vegetables, ensuring that everyone can eat 100 jin this winter. In the construction of houses, the brigades adopted methods such as repairing first and building later, and easy first and difficult later, based on the principles of adapting to local conditions, using simple and crude methods, and using local materials. In order to support the construction work of the brigades, the commune-run industrial enterprises produced 130,000 bricks and tiles, 3,000 saws, and a large number of other materials to meet the needs of the brigades in building houses. At the same time, the commune also transferred more than 100 carpenters and tile workers from the commune-run enterprise's capital construction team to help the brigades solve the difficulty of insufficient construction technical force and accelerate the construction progress, so that the commune completely repaired all 4,700 partially collapsed houses within two months. In addition, more than 5,500 new houses were built, completely solving the housing problem of the commune members in the disaster-stricken brigades.

    四淹四种，保住一定收成，社员生活安排妥当
    佟二堡公社灾害缩小到最低限度
    据新华社讯　今年遭受百年不遇特大洪水灾害的辽宁省辽阳市佟二堡人民公社，在党和国家的支援下，大力组织各受灾的生产大队开展生产救灾运动，两个月改变了灾区面貌。现在，全社在两个多月前被洪水冲毁的一些村庄已经全部重建起来，每个家庭都有了房子住。房前屋后堆满了柴草垛，家家炕热屋暖。公共食堂更是热气腾腾。人人棉袄、棉裤、棉鞋、棉帽俱全，穿得暖暖和和，愉快地进行着劳动、休息和学习。
    佟二堡公社抗灾斗争的巨大胜利，充分显示了社会主义社会制度和人民公社的无比优越性。解放前1929年的水灾比今年小，但那年仅现在的金沙沟大队一个村子的统计，二百多户人家，灾后生活十分困难的就有九十多户，为地主扛活的五十五户，外出逃荒的十六户，沿街乞讨的七户。今年的水灾比1929年大得多，由于灾害过于严重，全社的粮食减产八成以上。但是由于有党的领导、国家的援助和一大二公的人民公社，大大增强了人民战胜灾害的力量，灾后全社一万多户社员，无一户外出逃荒，无一人沿街乞讨，无一人病死饿死，生产和生活都得到了妥善安排。
    佟二堡人民公社在太子河中游的平原上，是今年6月辽宁东部地区发生特大洪水时受灾最重的一个公社。全社三十三个生产大队，有三十二个大队受了灾。85％的农田被洪水淹没，颗粒无收的达60％。很多房屋被洪水冲走和倒塌了。牲畜和农具也受到了不小的损失。但是经过广大社员两三个月时间的抗灾斗争，就迅速改变了灾区面貌。当严冬到来前夕，记者访问这个遭受严重灾害的公社时，看到灾后补种的庄稼已全部收上了场，新翻耕不久的土地散发着香气，一片片冬小麦已经出土。村子里不断传来翁翁的脱谷机器声和支支嘎嘎的滚子声，社员们有说有笑地在四周堆满禾垛的打谷场上打场。
    佟二堡公社能够战胜这样大的自然灾害，将灾情缩小到最低限度，主要是各个生产大队和广大社员及时开展了抗灾斗争。当洪水一退，各生产大队即在公社党委和大队党支部的领导下，集中全力恢复生产，掀起排水救苗、抢收抢种的生产高潮。共抢救出水淹庄稼一万三千多亩，抢收水涝玉米四千五百多亩。为了弥补粮食减产的损失，各大队都积极扩大秋菜播种面积，种一次被水淹了就再种，许多大队做到了四淹四种，共计抢种秋菜二千七百多亩。在抢种运动中，公社对各个受灾大队作了有力的支援。例如，各大队在抢种秋菜时普遍缺种籽，公社供销部门的职工，就用肩挑人背的办法，及时把六万斤菜籽运给各生产大队。另外，公社又及时派人到受灾大队，抢修了被洪水冲坏的锅驼机和柴油机。
    在秋收中，各个大队又集中优势兵力深入开展了“细收细打、颗粒还家、片叶不丢、寸草归垛”的群众运动。由于狠抓排水扶苗、抢收抢种和细收细打，使全社多收了二百六十多万斤粮食，收获蔬菜五百八十多万斤，为抗灾度荒增强了物质基础。灾后，各个生产队又大抓食堂工作，妥善安排社员过冬。在公社党委第一书记的带动下，许多大队的支部书记都亲自下伙房，带头搞好食堂。现在全社的红旗食堂，已由灾前的九个增加到二十个。各个食堂贮藏的蔬菜达五百五十多万斤，保证今冬每人能吃到一百斤。在修建住房上，各大队根据因地制宜，因陋就简，就地取材的原则，采取先修后建和先易后难等办法进行抢修。为了支援各大队的修建工作，公社社办工业生产了十三万块砖瓦、三千把锯子，以及大量的其它物料，满足了各大队修建房屋的需要。同时，公社还从社办企业的基本建设队伍中抽调了一百多名木瓦工人，帮助各大队解决了修建技术力量不足的困难，加速了修建进度，使全社在两个多月时间内，就把四千七百多间半倒塌的房屋全部修好，另外还增建新房五千五百多间，使受灾大队社员的住房完全得到解决。
