    U.S. Steel Industry Faces Severe Difficulties
    "Steel" Magazine Says Operating Rate Will Drop to 40%
    Oil Industry Figures Admit Oil Industry Faces Crisis

    (Dispatch from our newspaper) The U.S. steel industry faces increasingly severe difficulties this year. A recent issue of the U.S. "Steel" magazine wrote with concern that America's "hope of achieving 100 million tons of steel production is vanishing." The magazine estimates that in the second half of December, the operating rate of the steel industry will continue to decline, "dropping to 40% during the week of Christmas."

    Sales of U.S. steel products are also declining. The magazine says that December's purchases will also be "less than November's."

    At the same time, U.S. steel product exports in September decreased by 102,000 tons, falling to a net of 226,000 tons. According to "Steel" magazine, "If the trend of September continues, then the United States will have another foreign trade deficit in the steel industry this year."

    (Dispatch from our newspaper) Jones, a consultant for the Independent Petroleum Association of America, wrote to Defense Secretary Gates on the 7th, suggesting that the Department of Defense shift the majority of its oil purchases from abroad to domestic sources. In explaining his suggestion, Jones said: The U.S. domestic oil industry is facing a crisis, "U.S. oil refineries' current operating rate has dropped to only 80% to 85% of production capacity."

    美国钢铁工业困难严重
    《钢铁》杂志说开工率将降到40％
    石油界人士承认石油工业面临危机
    本报讯　美国今年钢铁工业困难日益严重。最近一期的美国《钢铁》杂志不安地写道，美国今年的“钢产量将达到一亿吨的希望正在消逝”。这家杂志估计12月下半月钢铁工业的开工率将继续下降，“在圣诞节的一周期间将下降到40％。”
    美国钢铁的销售量也在下降中。这家杂志说，12月份的购买量还“将少于11月”。
    同时，美国的钢铁产品在9月份已经减少了十万二千吨，下降到二十二万六千净吨。据《钢铁》杂志说：“如果9月份的趋势继续下去的话，那么美国在今年的钢铁业方面将产生另一个对外贸易逆差。”
    本报讯　美国独立石油协会顾问琼斯于7日写信给国防部长盖茨，建议国防部把大部分在国外采购的石油转向美国国内。琼斯在解释他的建议时说：美国国内的石油工业正面临危机，“美国炼油公司目前的开工率下降到只有生产能力的80％到85％。”
