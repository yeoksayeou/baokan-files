Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd: The All-China Federation of Textile Workers' Unions and the National Federation of Textile Workers of Cuba issued a joint statement in Beijing today. The statement pointed out: The current international situation is very favorable to the struggle of the people of the world against the aggression of imperialism headed by the United States. The forces of socialism, national liberation movements, peace and democracy have further overwhelmed the forces of imperialism, colonialism, war and reaction. In the statement, both sides severely condemned the recent criminal activities of US imperialism in blatantly dispatching naval and air forces to the Caribbean and creating tension. The statement said that this is another serious step taken by US imperialism to suppress the world's people's revolutionary movements and intensify international tensions, once again proving that US imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world. Both sides firmly believe that as long as the people of the world further strengthen their unity and continue their struggle, they will surely achieve greater and greater victories in the struggle against imperialism.

The signing ceremony of this joint statement was held in Beijing this evening. Signing the joint statement were: Zhang Jing and Wang Ruiyu, representatives of the All-China Federation of Textile Workers' Unions, and Ector Carbonell, Oscar Quintero, Rene Gonzalez, and Manuel Menendez, representatives of the National Federation of Textile Workers of Cuba.

Li Jiebo, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Kang Yonghe, Secretary of the Secretariat, and others attended the signing ceremony.

After the signing, the two sides shook hands cordially and raised their glasses in celebration.

Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd: Joint Statement of the All-China Federation of Textile Workers' Unions and the National Federation of Textile Workers of Cuba.

The delegation of the National Federation of Textile Workers of Cuba (hereinafter referred to as the Cuban Textile Union), headed by Ector Carbonell, Deputy Secretary of the Cuban Workers' Confederation Organization and Secretary-General of the Havana Province Textile Union, and composed of Oscar Quintero, Rene Gonzalez, and Manuel Menendez, visited the People's Republic of China in November 1960 at the invitation of the All-China Federation of Textile Workers' Unions (hereinafter referred to as the Chinese Textile Union). The delegation visited cities such as Beijing, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, visited factories, people's communes, and workers' cultural life and welfare facilities, and was honored to be received by Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai. They had extensive contacts with Chinese textile workers and trade union leaders and exchanged experiences.

During the visit, the Chinese Textile Union and the Cuban Textile Union delegation held cordial talks, and the two sides agreed to issue the following joint statement:

一

The Chinese Textile Union and the Cuban Textile Union unanimously believe that the current international situation is very favorable to the struggle of the people of the world against the aggression of imperialism headed by the United States. The forces of socialism, national liberation movements, peace, and democracy have further overwhelmed the forces of imperialism, colonialism, war, and reaction. The united front of the people of the world against imperialism headed by the United States is taking shape and growing stronger. The contradictions within the imperialist bloc are becoming more acute and profound and are accelerating toward disintegration. The United States is facing a new economic crisis, which will further weaken the United States' position in the capitalist world.

Both sides unanimously pointed out that the aggressive and war policies of US imperialism will not change due to a change of heads of state. The recent clamor by newly elected US President Kennedy about stepping up arms expansion and war preparations and subversive and aggressive activities shows that he will inherit the basic policies of Dulles and Eisenhower.

Both sides strongly condemn the US imperialist economic blockade aimed at strangling the Cuban revolution and are convinced that this blockade will suffer a shameful defeat just like the US imperialist economic blockade against China.

Both sides severely condemn the recent criminal activities of US imperialism in blatantly dispatching naval and air forces to the Caribbean and creating tension. Through this action, US imperialism is preparing to help the reactionary dictatorial governments of Guatemala and Nicaragua to suppress the national democratic movements in these countries and is plotting to create pretexts to launch military provocations against Cuba. Both sides unanimously pointed out that this is another serious step taken by US imperialism to suppress the world's people's revolutionary movements and intensify international tensions, once again proving that US imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world. The people of the world must be vigilant, strengthen unity, and wage unremitting struggle. Only in this way can they constantly frustrate the aggressive and war policies of imperialism headed by the United States and defend world peace.

二

The Chinese Textile Union is pleased to see that the Cuban people, under the leadership of Premier Castro, are waging a tit-for-tat struggle against US imperialism and are constantly pushing the revolution forward. The struggle and victory of the Cuban people have set a brilliant example for the people of Latin America in their struggle to safeguard national independence and strive for democratic freedom, and have made a significant contribution to the struggle of the people of the world against imperialist aggression and in defense of world peace. The Chinese textile workers express their heartfelt admiration for the revolutionary spirit and revolutionary achievements of the Cuban people.

The Chinese Textile Union expresses its firm support for the Cuban people and the people of Latin America in denouncing the US imperialist "Havana Declaration," which ruthlessly exposes the US imperialist crimes of aggression against Latin America and fully expresses the common demands and firm determination of the Cuban people and the people of Latin America to strive for and safeguard national independence, democratic freedom. The Chinese textile workers and the Chinese people, past, present, and future, will always stand unswervingly on the side of the Cuban people, resolutely support the Cuban people's struggle with all their efforts, and firmly believe that the Cuban people, with the support of the socialist camp and all peace-loving forces in the world, and relying on their own strength, will surely be able to smash any US imperialist interference and aggressive schemes and achieve a complete victory in the revolution.

The Cuban Textile Union is pleased to see that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, have achieved continuous victories in the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution through long-term struggle. They are now holding high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and are building socialism with confidence and have achieved great achievements. The Cuban Textile Union delegation deeply realizes that the attainment of these achievements is mainly due to the fact that the liberated Chinese people have a high degree of socialist consciousness and have given full play to their labor enthusiasm and creativity.

The Cuban Textile Union firmly supports the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Taiwan and oppose US imperialist aggression, and supports the restoration of the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

三

The Chinese Textile Union and the Cuban Textile Union are pleased to see that the forces of the socialist camp, striving for national liberation, striving for democratic freedom, and defending world peace have converged into a powerful torrent, and support and encourage each other, fiercely attacking our common enemy—imperialism.

Both sides unanimously stated that they firmly support the struggles of the people of Paraguay, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, and Nicaragua against US imperialism and dictatorial regimes; support the struggle of the people of Puerto Rico for national independence; support the struggle of the people of Panama to demand the recovery of sovereignty over the Canal Zone; support the struggles of all Latin American people against US imperialist control and plunder and to safeguard national independence; support the patriotic and just struggles of the people of Japan and Laos; support the struggles of the people of Asian countries to strive for and safeguard national independence; support the national liberation war of the Algerian people; support the struggle of the Congolese people to safeguard national independence and oppose US imperialism's use of the United Nations to carry out aggression; support the struggles of all African people to strive for national liberation; support the struggle of the people of the world to safeguard world peace, strive for peaceful coexistence among countries with different social systems, strive for universal disarmament, prohibit nuclear weapons, and oppose aggressive military treaties and foreign military bases.

Both sides firmly believe that as long as the people of the world further strengthen their unity and continue their struggle, they will surely be able to achieve greater and greater victories in the struggle against imperialism.

四

The Chinese Textile Union and the Cuban Textile Union are pleased to point out that in the common struggle against US imperialism and in defense of world peace, the people of China and Cuba have always supported and encouraged each other. With the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries and the visit to China by the economic delegation of the Cuban Revolutionary Government headed by Major Guevara, the friendly relations between the people of China and Cuba have been further developed. The visit to China by the Cuban Textile Union delegation headed by Carbonell and the signing of a joint statement with the Chinese Textile Union have enhanced the friendly unity of the textile workers of the two countries. Both sides unanimously agreed that the textile workers of China and Cuba will continue to exchange delegations and exchange experiences in trade union activities to make positive contributions to strengthening the unity of the international trade union movement.

    中国和古巴纺织工会在北京发表联合声明
    美帝国主义侵略政策决不会因更替首脑而改变
    紧密团结一致向美帝国主义进行坚持不懈斗争
    新华社2日讯　中国纺织工会全国委员会和古巴纺织工人全国联合会今天在北京发表联合声明。声明指出：目前国际形势对全世界人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义侵略的斗争十分有利，社会主义、民族解放运动、和平和民主的力量，进一步压倒了帝国主义、殖民主义、战争和反动力量。双方在声明中严厉谴责美帝国主义最近公然向加勒比海出动海空军、制造紧张局势的罪恶活动。声明说，这是美帝国主义镇压世界人民革命运动和加剧国际紧张局势的又一严重步骤，再一次证明了美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。双方坚信：全世界人民只要进一步加强团结，再接再厉地进行斗争，就一定能够在反对帝国主义的斗争中取得越来越大的胜利。
    这个联合声明的签字仪式今天晚间在北京举行。在联合声明上签字的是：中国纺织工会全国委员会代表张静、王瑞玉，古巴纺织工人全国联合会代表埃克托·卡波内利、奥斯卡·金特拉、雷内·冈萨雷斯、曼努埃尔·梅嫩德斯。
    中华全国总工会副主席李颉伯、书记处书记康永和等，参加了签字仪式。
    在签字以后，双方亲切握手，并且举杯祝贺。
    新华社2日讯　中国纺织工会全国委员会和古巴纺织工人全国联合会联合声明。
    以古巴工人联合会组织副书记、哈瓦那省纺织工会总书记埃克托·卡波内利为首的、并由奥斯卡·金特拉，雷内·冈萨雷斯，曼努埃尔·梅嫩德斯组成的古巴纺织工人全国联合会（以下简称古巴纺织工会）代表团，应中国纺织工会全国委员会（以下简称中国纺织工会）的邀请，于1960年11月访问了中华人民共和国。代表团访问了北京、郑州、武汉、上海、杭州等城市，参观了工厂、人民公社和工人文化生活、福利设施，荣幸地受到毛泽东主席和周恩来总理的接见，同中国纺织工人和工会领导人员进行了广泛的接触，并交流了经验。
    在访问期间，中国纺织工会和古巴纺织工会代表团进行了亲切的会谈，双方同意发表联合声明如下：一
    中国纺织工会和古巴纺织工会一致认为：目前国际形势对全世界人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义侵略的斗争十分有利，社会主义、民族解放运动、和平和民主的力量，进一步压倒了帝国主义、殖民主义、战争和反动的力量。全世界人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义的统一战线正在形成和日益壮大，帝国主义集团内部的矛盾更加尖锐化、深刻化，正在加速地走向四分五裂。美国正面临着一次新的经济危机，这次危机必将进一步削弱美国在资本主义世界中的地位。
    双方一致指出：美帝国主义的侵略政策、战争政策，决不会因为首脑人物的更替而改变。最近新当选的美国总统肯尼迪关于加紧扩军备战和颠复、侵略活动的叫嚣，说明他必将继承杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔的基本政策。
    双方严厉谴责美帝国主义旨在扼杀古巴革命的经济封锁，并且确信，这种封锁必将像美帝国主义对中国的经济封锁一样地遭到可耻的失败。
    双方严厉谴责美帝国主义最近公然向加勒比海出动海空军、制造紧张局势的罪恶活动。美帝国主义通过这一行动，准备帮助危地马拉和尼加拉瓜的反动独裁政府，镇压这些国家的民族民主运动，并且阴谋制造借口，发动对古巴的军事挑衅。双方一致指出：这是美帝国主义镇压世界人民革命运动和加剧国际紧张局势的又一严重步骤，再一次证明了美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。全世界人民必须提高警惕，加强团结，进行坚持不懈的斗争，只有这样才能不断挫败以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，保卫住世界和平。二
    中国纺织工会高兴地看到：古巴人民在卡斯特罗总理的领导下，对美帝国主义进行着针锋相对的斗争，把革命不断地推向前进。古巴人民的斗争和胜利为拉丁美洲人民维护民族独立、争取民主自由的斗争树立了光辉的榜样，并且对全世界人民反对帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平的斗争作出了重大的贡献。中国纺织工人对古巴人民的革命精神和革命成就，表示衷心的钦佩。
    中国纺织工会表示坚决支持古巴人民和拉丁美洲人民声讨美帝国主义的“哈瓦那宣言”，这一宣言无情地揭露了美帝国主义对拉丁美洲的侵略罪行，充分表达了古巴人民和拉丁美洲人民争取和维护民族独立、民主自由的共同要求和坚强斗志。中国纺织工人和中国人民一道，过去、现在和将来都始终不渝地站在古巴人民这一边，坚决用自己的一切努力来支持古巴人民的斗争，并且深信，古巴人民在社会主义阵营和全世界一切爱好和平力量的支持下，依靠自己的力量，一定能够粉碎美帝国主义的任何干涉和侵略阴谋，取得革命的彻底胜利。
    古巴纺织工会高兴地看到：中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，经过长期斗争，取得了民主革命和社会主义革命的不断胜利，现在正高举着总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，满怀信心地建设社会主义，并获得了伟大的成就。古巴纺织工会代表团深刻地体会到：这些成就的取得，主要是由于解放了的中国人民有着高度的社会主义觉悟，充分发挥了劳动积极性和创造性的结果。
    古巴纺织工会坚决支持中国人民解放台湾、反对美帝国主义侵略的正义斗争，支持恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中应有的合法席位。三
    中国纺织工会和古巴纺织工会高兴地看到：社会主义阵营、争取民族解放、争取民主自由和保卫世界和平的力量已经汇成一股强大的洪流，并且互相支持，互相鼓舞，向着我们共同的敌人——帝国主义猛烈地冲击。
    双方一致表示：坚决支持巴拉圭、多米尼加、危地马拉、尼加拉瓜人民反对美帝国主义、反对独裁政权的斗争，支持波多黎各人民要求民族独立的斗争，支持巴拿马人民要求收回运河区主权的斗争，支持所有拉丁美洲人民反对美帝国主义控制、掠夺、维护民族独立的斗争；支持日本人民和老挝人民的爱国正义斗争，支持亚洲各国人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争；支持阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放战争，支持刚果人民维护民族独立、反对美帝国主义利用联合国进行侵略的斗争，支持所有非洲人民争取民族解放的斗争；支持全世界人民维护世界和平、争取不同社会制度国家和平共处、争取普遍裁军、禁止核武器、反对侵略性军事条约和外国军事基地的斗争。
    双方坚信：全世界人民只要进一步加强团结，再接再厉地进行斗争，就一定能够在反对帝国主义的斗争中取得越来越大的胜利。四
    中国纺织工会和古巴纺织工会满意地指出：在反对美帝国主义、保卫世界和平的共同斗争中，中古两国人民一直是互相支持、互相鼓舞的。随着两国外交关系的建立和以格瓦拉少校为首的古巴革命政府经济代表团的访问中国，中古两国人民的友好关系得到了进一步的发展。以卡波内利为首的古巴纺织工会代表团的访问中国以及同中国纺织工会签订联合声明，增进了两国纺织工人的友好团结。双方一致同意，中古两国纺织工会将继续交换代表团和交流工会活动的经验，为加强国际工会运动的团结而作出积极的贡献。
