    Let Processing Machinery Run to the Countryside
    (Our report) The Dalian-Lushun Agricultural Production Materials Company is accelerating the supply of processing machinery to the countryside to support the communes in minimizing the use of manual labor and vigorously engaging in the comprehensive utilization of home-grown and wild raw materials. Currently, they have already allocated 125 universal feed pulverizers and 162 types of diesel engine parts, totaling more than 137,000 pieces.
    In order to ensure that the planned production of feed pulverizers and pulverizer parts are produced and allocated to the countryside as soon as possible, the company's employees have dispatched special personnel to be stationed in factories to help them solve practical problems in production. For example, the Dongchang Machinery Factory in Xinjin County needed 1,991 sets of "462" model bearings. The resident staff found a source of supply at the Lushun Bearing Factory and delivered them to the factory in time, ensuring that 500 feed pulverizers were assembled and left the factory on schedule.

    让加工机具跑步下乡
    本报讯　旅大市农业生产资料公司加速向农村供应加工机具，支援公社尽量少用人力，大搞家生、野生原料的综合利用。现在，他们已下拨万能饲料粉碎机一百二十五台，柴油机零件一百六十二种、十三万七千余件。
    这个公司的职工为了使计划生产的饲料粉碎机和粉碎机零件早出厂快下拨，派出专人驻厂，帮助工厂解决生产中的实际问题。如新金县东昌机械厂需要一千九百九十一套“四六二”型号轴承，驻厂员在旅顺轴承厂找到货源，及时交给工厂，保证了五百台饲料粉碎机按时组装出厂。
