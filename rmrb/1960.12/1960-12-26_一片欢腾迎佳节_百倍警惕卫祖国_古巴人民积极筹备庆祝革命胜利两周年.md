Xinhua News Agency, Havana, December 24th: In recent days, Havana has been adorned in festive attire. The Cuban people, who are valiantly fighting against interference from U.S. imperialism, are full of victorious joy and confidence as they welcome the second anniversary of the Cuban Revolution's victory, which falls on New Year's Day, 1961. Roads and streets are decorated with national flags, colorful neon lights, and illuminated arches. The vast majority of residents have exquisitely decorated their homes, which belong to them thanks to the implementation of the urban reform law. Revolutionary slogans and banners supporting urban reform and nationalization are posted on the bustling streets.

According to long-time residents of Havana, the prosperous and joyful atmosphere filling the markets on the eve of the New Year is unprecedented in past years. This situation is clearly the result of increased purchasing power among the people based on the development of production since the revolution. According to newspaper reports, Cuba's national income has increased from 2.21 billion pesos in 1958 to 2.8 billion pesos in 1960. In the first eight months of 1960, the total wages of all employees in Cuba increased by 164 million pesos. The new countryside after land reform has supplied the cities with a large amount of meat, vegetables, and fruits. Various beautiful and educational toys imported by Cuba from China and other socialist countries will soon be delivered to Cuban children through more than 1,000 people's stores.

Workers and farmers are commemorating the revolution's holiday and opposing the U.S. economic blockade with even greater production enthusiasm. Throughout Cuba, people have begun the labor of the sugar harvest season, as well as the harvesting of rice and other crops. The people's stores have prepared a large number of new farm tools for harvesting, supplying agricultural laborers; these tools are manufactured by Cuban factories or come from socialist countries.

On the eve of the joyous holiday, the Cuban people have not relaxed their revolutionary vigilance. Rebel army soldiers and militia on duty are guarding factories, farms, and the nation's coastline day and night, vigilant against interference and sabotage by U.S. imperialism and counter-revolutionary elements. In the mountainous areas, militia training is still being intensified.

A particularly striking sight on the streets of Havana is batches of female militia members, dressed in new uniforms and carrying weapons, heroically performing police work, maintaining public order, and remaining vigilant against sabotage by counter-revolutionary elements. This is a measure taken by the Cuban revolutionary government to strengthen the defense of the motherland. Captain Isabel Rielo (female), leader of the Lydia Twelfth Barracks, which dispatched female militia members to perform police work, proudly told reporters that women can stand on all fronts of the motherland alongside men, and they know how to defend the motherland.

    一片欢腾迎佳节　百倍警惕卫祖国
    古巴人民积极筹备庆祝革命胜利两周年
    新华社哈瓦那24日电　这几天来，哈瓦那已经披上节日的盛装。为反对美帝国主义干涉而英勇斗争着的古巴人民满怀胜利的欢乐和信心，迎接古巴革命胜利的两周年，这一天恰好是1961年元旦。马路和街道上都装饰着国旗、彩色霓虹灯和闪烁着灯光的拱门。绝大部分居民精致地装饰了由于实行城市改革法而属于他们自己的房屋。热闹的大街上张贴着革命的口号和支持城市改革和国有化的标语。
    据哈瓦那的老居民说，新年前夕充满市场的繁荣和欢乐气氛，是过去的年头里从来没有过的。这种情况显然是在革命以后发展生产的基础上人民购买力提高的结果。据报纸报道，古巴的国民收入已经从1958年的二十二亿一千万比索提高到1960年的二十八亿比索。而在1960年头八个月中，全古巴职工的工资总额增长了一亿六千四百万比索。土改后的新农村供应了城市大量的肉食、蔬菜和水果。古巴从中国和其它社会主义国家进口的各种漂亮和富有教育意义的玩具即将通过一千多家人民商店送到古巴儿童手中。
    工人和农民用更大的生产热情来纪念革命的节日和反对美国的经济封锁。在古巴各地，人民开始了榨糖季节的劳动以及水稻和其它农作物的收割工作。人民商店已经准备了大量收割用的新农具，供应农业劳动者，这些农具是由古巴工厂制造或是来自社会主义国家的。
    欢乐的节日前夕，古巴人民并没有放松革命警惕。起义军士兵和值班民兵日夜保卫着工厂、农庄和国家的海岸线，警惕着美帝国主义和反革命分子的干涉和破坏。在山区，民兵训练还在加紧进行。
    在哈瓦那大街上特别引人注目的景象，是一批批身穿新制服、手执武器的女民兵英勇地担任了警察工作，她们维持着公共秩序和警惕着反革命分子的破坏。这是古巴革命政府为加强保卫祖国而采取的措施。派出妇女民兵担任警察工作的利迪亚十二军营的领导人伊萨维耳·烈洛上尉（女）自豪地对记者说，妇女可以和男人一样站在祖国的各条战线上，她们知道怎样保卫祖国。
