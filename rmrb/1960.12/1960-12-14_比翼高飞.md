Standing on the riverbank dam, you can see the workshop of the three-ton converter steelmaking workshop, the towering blast furnace chimney, billowing thick smoke, and a red flag fluttering over the workshop. To the east of the No. 3 converter is the No. 1 converter, and they are competitors. In the recent competition, the No. 3 converter won the red flag four times in a row.

Gao Ming, the foreman of No. 3 furnace, was on scheduled leave that day, reading "Steelmaking" in his dormitory. Suddenly, he remembered that today was the day for the evaluation of No. 1 furnace and No. 3 furnace. He thought: It's almost certain that we'll keep the red flag this year, and next year won't be a problem either. Hey! It would be strange if our No. 3 furnace didn't lead the whole factory. Just as he was thinking happily, the door opened, and someone barged in.

"Foreman, foreman! No. 1 furnace is using new technology, our red flag, alas! Our red flag..."

Gao Ming saw the anxious look of Cai Lihe, the fireman who barged in, and knew that something big had happened, so he quickly asked, "What exactly happened?"

"Alas! In today's evaluation, the red flag was awarded to No. 1 furnace."

This news made Gao Ming's heart sink suddenly. He thought: We have been holding the title of model furnace in the whole factory, but now it's over. But then he thought: Evaluations are held every three days, the time is short, it doesn't count, the monthly evaluation will prove that we can catch up with them.

"Xiao Cai, let's go and see what technology they are using and how much they have completed the indicators." As they spoke, they walked towards the workshop office.

As soon as Gao Ming entered the office, he read the evaluation materials, shook his head and said: "This doesn't count, doesn't count, the monthly evaluation is what counts."

Secretary Huang, who was sitting on the side, stood up from his chair, patted him on the shoulder and said: "What, you're not convinced? Have you thought it over carefully? You have to calmly analyze the production situation of the two groups in these three days. It's not accidental that No. 1 converter won the red flag. In these three days, their output has been increasing day by day, and we should learn from their strengths." Speaking of this, Secretary Huang's face gradually became serious: "Gao Ming, I think your mood is not quite right, competition is for common improvement, but if it is for championism, then it is a big mistake. As the saying goes: 'What kind of flower blooms, what kind of fruit is produced, what kind of thought produces what kind of action.' I think your group, especially yourself, although you have made some achievements in production, the seeds of pride and complacency are showing." The phone rang. Secretary Huang answered the phone, and then said to Gao Ming peacefully: "Go back, hold a meeting with everyone in the group, check the reasons, and win the red flag back."

Gao Ming returned to the dormitory and thought for a long time. The saying "Modesty makes one progress, pride makes one fall behind" kept turning in his mind. Finally, he decided to learn from No. 1 furnace. He convened a production group meeting according to Secretary Huang's words.

The group meeting began, and someone said: "No. 1 furnace is really good, catching up with us silently." At this time, the fireman Cai Lihe said: "Just say that people have improved quickly, but don't check why our output is improving slowly!" You said one sentence, I said another, and the group meeting was very lively. Finally, everyone found that the main reasons for the slow increase in output were: complacency, failure to adopt new technologies, improper production organization, and long blowing time. Gao Ming said: "Let's take action immediately and send people to learn from No. 1 furnace."

The meeting ended, and they carried congratulatory letters, beat gongs and drums, and congratulated No. 1 furnace. When Ma Qiang, the foreman of No. 1 furnace, saw this scene, he excitedly shook Gao Ming's hand and said: "Lao Gao, our output has just caught up with you, and we haven't had time to summarize our experience..." Gao Ming said enthusiastically: "We must seriously learn from you." They both put on their fire-watching glasses and watched the tumbling steel waves in the furnace with all their attention. Ma Qiang directed the furnace rocking workers to correct the angle, and then he said: "If our group hadn't carried out rapid blowing and rapid slag removal, hey, it would be impossible to catch up with you! That's right, Lao Gao, you came at the right time, we were planning to exchange this experience with you after work." Ma Qiang introduced their experience in detail, and Gao Ming and his partners gathered in front of the furnace, listening attentively while taking notes in their notebooks.

At this time, it was time for No. 1 furnace to remove slag, and Ma Qiang quickly jumped into the slag pit that was more than a meter deep.

Slag removal is a difficult and heavy task. The red-hot steel slag just came out, like an erupting volcano. The heat wave prevents you from getting close, and the pit is filled with lime, asphalt and smoke. When people go down for two or three minutes, the thick work clothes are baked like an iron, and the diffused smoke chokes you so you can't breathe. However, Ma Qiang always took the lead in jumping down again and again, and the furnace workers also scrambled to jump down one by one. The slag was cleared in seven or eight minutes. Gao Ming, the foreman of No. 3 furnace, stood aside, watching their operation intently. Ma Qiang's spirit of taking the lead moved him, and he himself had not done this in the past. Removing one furnace of slag shortens the time by four minutes. In one shift of eight hours, one or two more furnaces of steel can be produced! Yes, we must learn from them.

Ma Qiang jumped out of the slag pit, wiped his sweat, and said to Gao Ming: "Lao Gao, just now I introduced the rapid slag removal, you see..." Ma Qiang only said half of his words when the furnace workers nervously reported: "Foreman Ma, look, it's bad, there are only three fingers left in the tuyere, and it looks like it won't work after one more furnace, how can we complete the indicator of fifteen furnaces!"

With this shout, the furnace workers gathered around, and everyone proposed to turn the dead furnace into a live furnace, and never let go until twenty furnaces of steel were produced. Suddenly, someone said: "The tuyere is almost gone!" Everyone became nervous. Ma Qiang immediately checked the tuyere and said: "The tuyere is badly damaged, it won't work if we blow down." At this critical moment, Gao Ming stared intently at the two rows of remaining tuyeres and said, "No, we must blow down!"

In the steelmaking workshop, everyone knows that Gao Ming is a famous "furnace repairer". He said he had a way, it must work. Gao Ming rushed to repair the tuyere. The iron chisel in his hand was burning red, but he still gritted his teeth and rescued the tuyere...

Ten minutes later, Gao Ming came down from the furnace, waved his hand and said: "It's okay!"

"Send air!" Ma Qiang shouted loudly to the blower room. At this time, the blower made its usual roar again. The hands of the two foremen were tightly clasped together.

    比翼高飞
    刘茂恩
    站在河堤的大坝上，可以看到那三吨转炉炼钢车间的厂房，那顶天立地的化铁炉烟囱，正浓烟滚滚，厂房上空飘着一面红旗。在三号转炉的东边，是一号转炉，它们是竞赛对手。在最近的大竞赛中，三号转炉接连四次得了红旗。
    三号炉长高鸣，这天正摊轮休，独个儿在宿舍里看《炼钢学》。忽然他想起今天是一号炉和三号炉评比的日子。他想：年内保住红旗，十拿九稳了，明年么，也不成问题。嘿！咱三号炉不在全厂挂帅那才怪哩。正当他想得高兴，房门开了，闯进一个人来。
    “炉长，炉长！一号炉采用新技术，咱们的红旗，唉！咱们的红旗……”
    高鸣一看闯进来的看火工蔡利和的紧张劲，就知道大事不好，于是赶忙问道：“到底发生了啥事？”
    “唉！今天评比，红旗评给一号炉啦。”
    这消息，使高鸣的心情顿时沉重起来。他想：咱接连保住全厂的标兵炉，这下完啦。但他又想：三天一评比，时间短，不能作数，到月底一评总，我们会赶过他们的。
    “小蔡，走，看看他们采用的啥技术，指标完成多少。”他们边说边往车间办公室走去。
    高鸣一进办公室，看完评比材料，摇摇头说：“这不作数，不作数，到月底看评总那才服人。”
    坐在一旁的黄书记从椅子上站起来，拍拍他的肩膀说：“怎么，不服气，仔细想过了没有？要冷静分析下两个小组这三天的生产情况嘛。一号转炉夺得红旗不是偶然的，这三天他们产量一天比一天高，应该好好学习人家的长处。”说到这里，黄书记的脸色渐渐严肃起来：“高鸣，我看你的情绪不大对头啊，竞赛嘛，是为了共同提高，要是锦标主义，那就大错特错了。俗语说：开什么花结什么果，有什么思想就产生什么行动。我看你们小组，尤其是你自己，虽然生产上有了些成就，但是，骄傲自满的苗头露出来了。”电话铃响了。黄书记接过电话，又平和地对高鸣说：“回去吧，在小组里跟大伙开个会，检查下原因，把红旗夺回来。”
    高鸣回到宿舍，想了许久，“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”这句话，总在他脑子里转。最后他下定决心向一号炉学习，他按照黄书记的话召开了生产小组会。
    小组会开始了，不知是谁说了句：“一号炉真行啊，不声不响赶上了我们。”这时，看火工蔡利和说：“光说人家提高得快，就不检查检查为什么我们产量提高得慢！”你一言，我一语，小组会开得很热烈。最后大家找到了产量提高得慢的主要原因是：满足于现状，没有采取新技术，生产组织不当，吹炼时间长等。高鸣说：“咱们立即行动，派人去向一号炉学习。”
    会散了，他们扛着贺信，敲着锣鼓，向一号炉祝贺。一号炉炉长马强一见这番情景，激动地握着高鸣的手说：“老高，我们产量刚刚赶上你们，还没来得及总结经验哩……”高鸣热情地说：“我们要认真向你们学习。”他们俩戴起看火镜，全神贯注观看炉内翻腾的钢浪，马强指挥着摇炉工校正角度，接着他说：“我们组要不是搞快速吹炼和快速扒渣，嗨，要想赶上你们还不行啊！对啦，老高你们来得太好啦，咱正打算下班后向你们交流这个经验哩。”马强详详细细介绍着他们的经验，高鸣和他的伙伴们都聚在炉前，一面静听，一面在本子上记着笔记。
    这时，一号炉该扒渣啦，马强迅速地跳进一丈多深的渣坑里去。
    出渣，这是一项艰苦的重活，红通通的钢渣刚刚出来，像是一座爆发的火焰山，那一股热浪逼得你不能近前，满坑里都充塞着石灰、沥青和烟雾，人下去两、三分钟，厚厚的工作服就被烤得像烙铁，弥漫的烟雾，呛得你透不过气来。但是，马强总是一次又一次地带头跳下去，炉前工们也一个个争着往下跳，七、八分钟内渣就出清了。三号炉长高鸣站在一旁，目不转瞬地看他们操作，马强身先士卒的精神使他感动，他自己平时就没有做到这一点。出一炉渣缩短四分钟，一班八小时下来，说少的也要多出一至两炉钢！对，这得好好向人家学习啊。
    马强跳出渣坑，一边揩拭着汗水，一边对高鸣说：“老高，刚才就是我介绍的快速扒渣，你看……”马强的话只说了一半，突然炉前工紧张地报告说：“马炉长，你看，坏啦，风眼只剩下三个指头那么多了，眼看再炼一炉就不行啦，怎能完成十五炉的指标呀！”
    这一嚷，炉前工们都聚集起来，大伙提出一定要使死炉变活炉，不炼出二十炉钢决不放手。突然，又有人说：“风眼快没有了！”大家都紧张起来。马强马上检查了风眼说：“风眼坏得很厉害，吹下去是不行的。”正当这紧急关头，高鸣狠命地盯着两排剩下来的风眼，说了声：“不，一定要吹下去！”
    在炼钢车间里，谁都知道，高鸣是有名的“修炉神手”。他说有办法，一定能行。高鸣抢着去修风眼。手里的铁钎烧红了，他仍然紧咬着牙，在抢救风眼……
    十分钟后，高鸣从炉上下来，一挥手说：“行啦”！
    “送风！”马强大声地向风机房喊着。这时，鼓风机又发出惯常的轰鸣声。两个炉长的手紧紧握在一起。
