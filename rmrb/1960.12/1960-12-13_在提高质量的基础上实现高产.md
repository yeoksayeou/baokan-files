    Achieve High Yields While Improving Quality
    Li Fengwu, Worker at Xi'an Hongqi Electrical Machinery Factory

    In the increasing production and practicing economy campaign, our workshop, while ensuring a substantial increase in product output, has also paid more and more attention to improving product quality. Everyone has put forward the slogan "Not let a single defective product pass," determined to comprehensively over fulfill all production targets for the fourth quarter of this year.

    Achieving high yields on the basis of high-quality standards is a long-term policy of the Party in leading industrial production. Every one of us workers must firmly remember this at all times. Quality and quantity are a unity of opposites; they are interdependent and conditional on each other. There is no quantity without quality, and no quality without quantity. Quality is in quantity, and quantity is in quality. Any product contains a certain quality and a certain quantity. The quantity of a product is based on a certain quality, and the quality of a product is expressed through a certain quantity. In general, quality always occupies the main position in the contradiction between quantity and quality. High yield is high yield on the basis of high quality; only high quality can truly guarantee high yield. In April this year, only 40% of the 750 electric motors produced in our workshop were qualified, while in October, the qualified rate of the 450 electric motors produced reached over 95%. In terms of quantity, April produced 300 more units than October, but overall, October actually produced 127 more units than April. This example fully illustrates that products have certain specifications, and only by meeting the specifications can we ensure quantity. This is an objective law.

    However, after grasping this law, how can we make it play a greater role in production? This requires us to clearly recognize the significance of improving product quality, especially the far-reaching significance of ensuring quality in promoting the current increasing production and practicing economy campaign centered on grain and steel. Today, the country and the people not only require us to produce more industrial products, but also demand better and finer quality. If the quality of products is better and finer, even though the quantity is the same, its service life is extended, which is equivalent to increasing the quantity. Therefore, the superiority of socialism is not only reflected in the quantity of products, but also in the quality of products. In the past, we did not have a deep understanding of the practical significance of this. In June this year, when our workshop workers participated in the summer harvest in the Mengcun Brigade of the Qujiangchi People's Commune in Xi'an, there was an electric motor on the ground driving a waterwheel to irrigate the land, preparing for summer sowing. We asked the farmers about the quality of this electric motor, and they said with great excitement: "The quality of this electric motor is very good! It hasn't been repaired since we bought it. It has saved our team more than 50 laborers. If it weren't for it, we wouldn't have been able to free up so many laborers for the summer harvest this year." This example shows that the people pay great attention to product quality. Not long after, the Xi'an Machine Tool Factory produced more than 50 machine tools and decided to assemble the electric motors and ship them out immediately. At that time, the Machine Tool Factory purchased more than 20 2.8-kilowatt electric motors from our factory, but because of poor quality, all of them were returned, thus delaying the shipment date of the Machine Tool Factory's more than 20 machine tools by half a month. These vivid facts made the workers in our workshop deeply realize that, under the situation of the rapid development of socialist construction, the demand for the quantity of industrial products is increasing, and the demand for quality is getting higher and higher. We must do everything possible to improve the quality of every product. Our emphasis on quality does not mean that we can disregard quantity, but that we must strive to increase the quantity of products on the basis of ensuring quality. If we one-sidedly emphasize quality and neglect to increase quantity, then no matter how good the product quality is, we will not be able to complete the quantity required by the state plan, which is detrimental to socialist construction. Therefore, we must pay attention to both quality and quantity, correctly understand the dialectical relationship between quality and quantity, establish an all-round view of "high quality and high yield," and strive to produce more and better industrial products with less manpower and material resources.

    在提高质量的基础上实现高产
    西安红旗交电机械厂工人　李凤梧
    在增产节约运动中，我们车间在保证产品大幅度增产的同时，对提高产品质量也越来越重视了，大家提出了“不让一件废品过关”的口号，决心全面超额完成今年第四季度各项生产指标。
    在高质量标准的基础上实现高产，这是党在领导工业生产中一个长期的方针，我们每个工人，任何时候都必须牢牢地记着这句话。质量和数量是矛盾统一的关系，它们是互相依存、互为条件的。世界上没有脱离质量的数量，也没有脱离数量的质量。质中有量，量中有质。任何产品都包含着一定的质量和一定的数量，产品的数量是在一定质量的基础上的数量，产品的质量是通过一定数量表现出来的。而在一般的情况下，质量总是在数量和质量矛盾中占主要地位。高产是在优质基础上的高产，只有优质才能真正保证高产。今年4月，我们车间生产的七百五十台电动机中，合格的只有40％，而10月份生产的四百五十台电动机中，合格的达到95％以上。从数量上看，4月要比10月多生产三百台，但全面看，10月比4月实际多生产了一百二十七台。这个例子就充分说明了产品是有一定规格的，只有合乎规格，才能确保数量。这是一条客观规律。
    但是在掌握了这条规律以后，又怎样使这条规律在生产中起更大的作用呢？这就要求我们明确认识提高产品质量的意义，特别是保证质量对推动当前以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动的深远意义。今天，国家和人民不仅要求我们生产出更多的工业品，而且要求质量更好更精。产品质量更好更精了，虽则是同样的数量，但它的使用寿命延长了，就相当于增加了数量。因此，社会主义的优越性，不仅表现在产品数量上，而且表现在产品质量上。过去，我们对这方面的实际意义就体会不深。今年6月，我们车间职工在西安曲江池公社孟村大队参加夏收，当时地头有部电动机正在带动水车灌水，准备夏播。我们就向农民打听这部电动机的质量情况，他们极兴奋地说：“这部电动机的质量可好啦！买回来还没有修过，它给我们队里节约了五十多个劳力，要不是它呀，今年夏收那能腾出这么多劳力来。”这个例子说明，人民群众是很注意产品质量的。不久以后，西安机床厂生产出了五十多台机床，决定装配好电动机马上出厂。当时，机床厂就向我厂购去了二十多台二点八瓩的电动机，结果由于质量不好，全部退回，因此，使机床厂的二十多台机床延长了出厂日期达半月之久。这些活生生的事实，使我们车间职工深刻地认识到，在社会主义建设事业飞速发展的形势下，对工业产品的数量要求愈来愈多，质量要求愈来愈高，我们必须千方百计提高每一件产品的质量。我们强调质量并不是可以不顾数量，而是要在保证质量的基础上努力提高产品的数量。如果片面地强调质量而忽视提高数量，那么，产品质量再好，也完不成国家计划所要求的数量，这对社会主义建设是不利的。因此，我们既要重视质量，又要重视数量，正确认识质量和数量的辩证关系，树立“优质高产”的全面观点，力争用更少的人力和物力，生产出更多更好的工业产品来。
