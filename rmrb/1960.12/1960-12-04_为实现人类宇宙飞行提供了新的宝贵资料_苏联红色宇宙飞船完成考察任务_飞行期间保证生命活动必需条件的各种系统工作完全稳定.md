Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd: TASS, Moscow, December 3rd dispatch: The Soviet Union's third satellite spaceship continued to orbit the Earth until 12:00 Moscow time on December 2, 1960. By this time, the scheduled experiments on the spaceship structure and various systems installed on the spaceship, medical-biological explorations, and all the specified space explorations had been completed. The information obtained provides new data for realizing human spaceflight in the near future.

After obtaining the necessary data, an order was issued to allow the satellite spaceship to descend to the ground. Because the descent was along an unplanned trajectory, the satellite spaceship ceased to exist upon entering the dense atmosphere.

The TASS communique issued for this purpose pointed out, when discussing the completion of the exploration plan, that supplementary data had been obtained on the influence of various factors occurring when the satellite spaceship entered orbit on animal organisms, and on the behavior of animals under space flight conditions. Through measurements and television equipment, scientific information was obtained about the functions of the circulatory and respiratory systems of the experimental animals and their behavior under the influence of vibration, G-force, noise, and weightlessness.

The communique said that the results of processing the information obtained from the satellite spaceship showed that the little dogs endured the period of entering orbit relatively easily, and their bodily functions quickly returned to normal. Various objective physiological values indicating the condition of the experimental animals remained close to normal values even when the experimental animals were in a state of weightlessness for several hours; the animals' behavior was calm and composed, and their movements were coordinated.

Supplementary data was obtained on the reliability of the spaceship structure, the function of its various units and systems, and the operation of the spaceship's power supply.

The stable operation of the radio telemetry system ensured that the necessary data on the operation of the internal equipment and the condition of the animals was transmitted back to the ground.

The radio technology equipment used to control the internal equipment from the ground and to verify the flight trajectory worked reliably during the flight of the satellite spaceship. The television equipment ensured the observation of the condition and behavior of the animals. The experimental results sent back to the ground confirmed that the various systems (air conditioning, temperature control, communication, etc.) designed to ensure the normal life activities of future human flights worked completely stably during the flight.

The communique said that the final stage of the carrier rocket continued to operate along its original orbit.

    为实现人类宇宙飞行提供了新的宝贵资料
    苏联红色宇宙飞船完成考察任务
    飞行期间保证生命活动必需条件的各种系统工作完全稳定
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科3日讯：苏联第三个卫星式宇宙飞船到1960年12月2日莫斯科时间十二时为止继续围绕地球运行，预定的飞船结构及装在飞船上的各种系统的试验、医学——生物学考察，以及规定的宇宙空间考察的全部工作，到这时已经全部完成。所获得的情况为在不久的将来实现人的宇宙飞行提供了新的资料。
    在获得了必需的资料以后，发出了让卫星式飞船向地面降落的命令。由于下降是沿着一条非预计的轨道，卫星式飞船在进入稠密大气层时停止存在。
    塔斯社为此发表的公报在谈到考察计划完成情况时指出，获得了在卫星式飞船进入轨道时发生的各种因素对动物机体影响、动物在宇宙飞行条件下的行动的补充资料。通过测量和电视装置获得了关于在振动、超重、噪声和失重影响下试验动物的循环系统和呼吸系统机能及它们的行动的科学情报。
    公报说，对从卫星式飞船获得的情报进行整理的结果表明，小狗相当轻松地经受了进入轨道的时期，它们的机体活动迅速恢复正常。标示试验动物状况的各种客观生理数值，在试验动物处于失重状态若干小时的情况下，仍然接近于通常的值；动物的行动是安然自若的，它们的动作是协调的。
    获得了关于飞船构造可靠性、它的各个机组和系统的作用和飞船电源工作情况的补充资料。
    无线电遥测系统的稳定工作，保证向地面发回了有关舱内装置工作情况和动物的状况的必要资料。
    用来从地面控制舱内的装置和检验飞行轨道的无线电技术装备，在卫星式飞船的飞行过程中工作得很有把握。电视设备保证了对动物的状况和行动的观察。发回到地面的试验结果证实，在飞行期间，预定用来保证在今后人进行飞行时的正常生命活动的必需条件的各种系统（空气调节、温度调节、通讯等）的工作是完全稳定的。
    公报说，运载火箭最后一级继续沿着原先的轨道运行。
