Xinhua News Agency report: Jilin Specialty College teachers are adopting the method of combining labor, teaching, and scientific research, which has greatly enriched their professional knowledge of specialties and better enabled them to complete their teaching tasks.

Jilin Specialty College is a new type of higher specialty school in China, which has been responsible for training specialty professionals in Jilin Province since its establishment in 1958. The college is located in a semi-mountainous rural area, adjacent to the Jilin Province Specialty Research Institute. Currently, it has three specialties: economic animals, medicinal plants, and fruit tree gardening. In order to rapidly improve the teachers' professional knowledge of specialties, the college has decided to cooperate closely with the Jilin Specialty Research Institute and implement the "three combinations" of teaching, production labor, and scientific research. In September 1959, the college organized 38 teachers to go to the relevant experimental fields of the Jilin Specialty Research Institute for further study. They were both teachers at the Specialty College and workers at the experimental field and technicians at the Specialty Research Institute. They summarized the practical experience of workers in labor practice, accumulated data, conducted scientific research, compiled teaching materials, and completed teaching tasks. During their advanced studies, they ate, lived, worked, and researched with the workers in the experimental field, and humbly learned from the workers, discovering many valuable knowledge not found in books. For example, teachers in the medicinal plants specialty found that large areas of belladonna herbs were infested with twenty-eight-spotted ladybugs, but no medicine to eliminate this pest was found in the textbooks. After studying with the workers, they used DDT petroleum emulsion spray, which eliminated the pest. This knowledge was very useful for their scientific research and compilation of teaching materials. Liu Zhiguo, a teacher in the medicinal plants specialty, has theoretically summarized three advanced seedling planting methods of workers through transplanting belladonna. Some scientific research conducted by the teachers in cooperation with workers and technicians in the experimental field has achieved good results.

Over the past year, teachers at Jilin Specialty College have completed 12 important scientific research projects, such as "Artificial Cultivation of Wild Mushrooms" and "Occurrence and Control of Caterpillars on Asarum," in the course of labor, teaching, and scientific research; collected more than 800 medicinal plant specimens; compiled new teaching materials for five courses, including Economic Animal Disease Diagnosis and Treatment and Fur Animal Husbandry; and revised a course in Economic Animal Husbandry.

With the increase of specialty knowledge and the strengthening of theoretical research, the teaching quality of the entire school has been significantly improved. In the past, teachers generally gave more theoretical lectures and arranged very few experimental classes. After labor training, they learned the practical operation techniques of specialties and changed the phenomenon of theory being divorced from practice. The amount of theoretical lectures and experimental activities in many courses is now roughly equal. Huang Shiwei, a teacher who teaches plant protection, has learned about more than 100 kinds of insect pests of medicinal herbs after participating in labor training, and has compiled more than 30 kinds of new teaching materials for preventing and controlling insect pests of medicinal herbs.

These training activities have also enabled teachers to further improve their understanding of "science comes from practice." Li Peiquan, a teacher of economic animal parasitology, used to think that he could not learn professional knowledge as a breeder. Once, while feeding foxes, he found many insect eggs in the fox feces, so he worked hard to find out the parasites of the foxes and researched a simple and easy method of using Chinese medicine to repel insects, which worked very well. In three months, he compiled a much-needed book on economic animal parasitology with tens of thousands of words.

Xinhua News Agency report: Leading cadres of Handan Normal School have gone deep into the forefront of teaching to strengthen teaching leadership, which has powerfully promoted teaching reform and improved teaching quality.

This semester, in order to further go into reality and strengthen the leadership of teaching, the Party committee of this school organized leading cadres to implement the "Three-Two-One-One System," that is, the Party secretary and members spend three days a week going deep into the teaching and research office, classrooms, and canteens, two days studying work, one day studying, and one day off. When going deep into the teaching and research office, classrooms, and canteens, the leading cadres also adopted the method of "dissecting 'sparrows,' rooting at points, and bearing fruit on the surface" to specifically help each class and teacher solve problems and improve work. After Party Secretary Li Zijun went deep into the Chinese language teaching and research group, he found that some teachers corrected homework a lot, but the teaching effect was not necessarily good. After studying and analyzing with the teachers, he found that the reason for this phenomenon was that the teachers did not pay enough attention to the organic connection between speaking, reading, practicing, and writing in the Chinese language class. In order to change this situation, Li Zijun helped the Chinese language teachers improve their teaching methods, and adopted methods such as knowledge classification, concise lectures and more practice, combining pre-class guidance and after-class practice, combining practice and writing, and combining detailed and careful corrections with key corrections, so that speaking, reading, writing, and practicing formed a dragon. After experimentation, this teaching method had good results, which not only improved students' academic performance, but also reduced the amount of homework corrected by teachers. After this experience was promoted throughout the school, it promoted the improvement of the entire school's teaching work.

After the school's leading cadres went deep into the forefront of teaching, they also generally paid attention to promoting teaching reform by grasping ideology and experiments. In the process of focusing on helping the mathematics teaching and research group improve teaching, Wu Shusheng, a member of the Party committee and vice president, found that some teachers had a fear of difficulties and mysterious views on strengthening textbook construction. He strengthened ideological work on the one hand, and specifically helped teachers to achieve "three familiarities" (familiar with textbook focus, familiar with students' knowledge base and learning "difficulties", familiar with teachers' own teaching situation) On the basis of this, the lesson plans were revised four times. As a result, not only was the class time reduced, but also 93% of the students achieved excellent results in the test.

    改进工作方法　提高教学质量
    吉林特产学院教师边实践边教学边研究丰富了专业知识
    邯郸师范学校领导干部实行“三二一一制”深入教学第一线
    据新华社讯　吉林特产学院教师采用边劳动、边教学、边搞科学研究的方法，大大丰富了特产专业知识，更好地完成了教学任务。
    吉林特产学院是我国的一所新型的高等特产专科学校，从1958年建立以来，就担负起培养吉林省特产专业人材的任务。这个学院设立在一个半山区的农村中，同吉林省特产研究所毗连。目前，设有经济动物、药用植物、果树园林三个专业。这个学院为了迅速提高教师的特产专业知识水平，确定同吉林特产研究所密切协作，实行教学、生产劳动和科学研究“三结合”。1959年9月，学院组织了三十八名教师分别到吉林特产研究所有关的试验场进修。他们既是特产学院的教师，又是试验场的工人和特产研究所的技术人员，在劳动实践中总结工人的实际经验，积累资料，进行科学研究和编写教材，完成教学任务。他们在进修中，同试验场的工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同研究，虚心向工人学习，发现了许多书本上没有的宝贵知识。例如，药用植物专业的教师在劳动中，发现大面积颠茄药草有二十八星瓢虫为害，但是课本上找不到消灭这种虫害的药物，经过同工人一起研究，用滴滴涕石油乳剂喷洒，结果消灭了虫害。这些知识，对于他们进行科学研究和编写教材很有用处。药用植物专业教师刘治国通过移植颠茄，已从理论上总结了工人的三种先进栽苗方法。教师们和试验场工人、技术人员合作进行的一些科学研究，都取得了良好效果。
    一年多来，吉林特产学院的教师们在边劳动、边教学、边搞科学研究中，共完成了“野生蘑菇人工栽培”、“细辛毛虫的发生及防治”等十二项重要科学研究项目；收集药用植物标本八百多份；编出经济动物疾病诊疗学、毛皮兽饲养学等五门课程的新教材；并修改了一门经济动物饲养学。
    随着特产知识的增长，理论研究工作的加强，全校的教学质量有了显著提高。过去，教师们一般理论课讲得多，实验课安排得很少。经过劳动进修，学到了特产的实际操作技术，改变了理论脱离实际的现象，许多课程理论讲授和实验活动的份量已经大体相等。讲授植物保护课的教师黄世炜，参加劳动进修后，共了解一百多种药草的虫害，编出了三十多种防治药草虫害的新教材。
    通过这些进修活动，也使教师们进一步提高了对“实践出科学”的认识。经济动物寄生虫课教师李沛权过去认为当饲养员学不到专业知识。有一次，他在喂养狐狸时，发现狐狸粪便中有许多虫卵，于是下功夫摸清了狐狸的寄生虫，并且研究出用中药驱虫的简单易行办法，效果很好。在三个月中，他编出了一门切合需要的有十几万字的经济动物寄生虫学。
    据新华社讯　邯郸市师范学校领导干部，深入教学第一线加强教学领导，有力地促进了教学改革，提高了教学质量。
    本学期，这个学校的党委为了进一步深入实际，加强对教学的领导，组织领导干部实行了“三二一一制”，即党委书记和委员每周有三天时间深入教研室、课堂和食堂，两天研究工作，一天学习，一天休息。在深入教研室、课堂和食堂时，各领导干部又采取“解剖‘麻雀’，点上生根，面上结果”的方法，具体帮助各班级和教师解决问题，提高工作。党委书记李子君深入到语文教研组以后，发现有的教师批改作业的份量比较重，但教学效果却不一定好。他和教师共同研究分析后，发现产生这种现象的原因是，教师对语文课的讲、读、练、写等方面的有机联系注意不够。为了改变这种情况，李子君便帮助语文教师改进了教学方法，采取知识归类，精讲多练，课前指导与课后练习相结合，练习与写作相结合，精批细改与重点批改相结合等办法，使讲、读、写、练形成了一条龙。经过实验，这种教学方法效果良好，既提高了学生的学习成绩，又减轻了教师批改作业的份量。这项经验在全校推广后，促进了整个学校教学工作的改进。
    学校领导干部深入教学第一线以后，还普遍注意通过抓思想、抓试验，促进教学改革。党委委员、副校长吴树声在重点帮助数学教研组改进教学的过程中，发现有的教师对加强教材建设有畏难情绪和神秘观点，他便一方面加强思想工作，一方面具体帮助教师达到“三熟知”
  （熟知教材重点，熟知学生知识基础和学习“难点”，熟知教师本身讲课情况）的基础上，对教案进行了四次修改。结果不但缩减了课时，还使93％的学生测验成绩达到了优良。（附图片）
