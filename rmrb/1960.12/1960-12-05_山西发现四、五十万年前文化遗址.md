Shanxi Discovers Cultural Relics from 400,000-500,000 Years Ago

Recently, in the area of Kehe Village, Ruicheng County, in southwestern Shanxi Province, many Paleolithic artifacts and fossils of ancient mammals contemporaneous with Peking Man have been discovered. These Paleolithic artifacts and ancient mammals date back 400,000 to 500,000 years.

Through joint investigation and excavation in this area by the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Shanxi Provincial Cultural Relics Management Committee, this batch of stone tools and fossils was discovered in the gravel layer at the bottom of the Quaternary sediments along the Yellow River. The discovered stone tools are mainly made of quartzite gravel, including some chopping tools, scrapers, and stone balls that were used by humans at that time, as well as a large number of stone flakes and stone cores left over from the making of stone tools. From the manufacturing methods, shapes, and other characteristics of the stone tools, it can be seen that the era of these stone tools belongs to the Middle Pleistocene of the Quaternary period, which is the same as the era of the Peking Man stone tool culture at Zhoukoudian. Among the animal fossils discovered are saber-toothed elephants and swollen deer, which are commonly found in Zhoukoudian.

    山西发现四、五十万年前文化遗址
    在山西省西南部芮城县匼河村一带，最近发现了不少与中国猿人同时代的旧石器和古哺乳动物化石。这些旧石器和古哺乳动物的时代在距今四、五十万年以前。
    经中国科学院古脊椎动物与古人类研究所和山西省文物管理委员会共同在这一带调查和发掘，在黄河沿岸第四纪沉积底部的砾石层中发现了这批石器和化石。被发现的石器主要是用石英岩砾石打制成的，包括一部分被当时人类使用过的砍具、刮削器和石球，以及在制作石器时剩下的大量石片和石核。从石器的制作方法和形态等性质，可以看出这些石器的时代属于第四纪更新世中期，同北京周口店中国猿人的石器文化时代相同。在发现的动物化石中，有剑齿象和在周口店常见的肿骨鹿等。
