Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 15th: This reporter reports: The new type of socialist competition initiated by the Korean working class last spring—the Chollima Work Team Movement—has seen even broader and more comprehensive development this year. Now, this movement has become a tremendous driving force for the rapid development of the Korean people's economy, a good method for enlightened working people to participate in economic management, and a communist school for transforming people into new communist individuals.

Entering this year, a particularly prominent feature of the development of this movement is: the scope of the movement is expanding, and it has become a mass movement involving all the people. Currently, in addition to the vast number of workers, farmers, cultural, educational, scientific, and medical workers from all over the country have joined the torrent of this movement. The number of participants and work teams has rapidly increased from 50,000 people and 2,646 work teams at the end of last year to more than 320,000 people and more than 16,700 work teams currently. Now, 868 work teams across the country have won the glorious title of Chollima Work Team, which is more than four times the number at the beginning of this year. In addition, the working people participating in this movement are now not only creating Chollima Work Teams, but also creating Chollima Workshops, Chollima Factories, Chollima Schools, Chollima Hospitals, and so on.

The Chollima Work Team Movement is a movement to boldly break with conservatism and mysticism in production and technology, and to launch a major revolution. It has played a huge role in promoting this year's production, improving labor productivity, and carrying out technological innovation. The more than 1,400 work teams in South Pyongan Province participating in this movement increased labor productivity by 33% in the twelve months before October of this year. More than 90% of the workers in South Hamgyong Province participating in this movement completed their annual production tasks ahead of schedule in September. According to the statistical data of 500 work teams that have won the title of Chollima Work Team, their labor productivity in the six months after obtaining this title increased by 31.4% compared to the six months before obtaining this title; and in the machinery manufacturing industry, it increased by 56%.

This year, in response to the call of the Korean Workers' Party to carry out a comprehensive technological innovation movement, every Chollima Work Team took the lead. The Zhu Chengyi Chollima Youth Work Team of the Ryongsong Machinery Factory, together with the factory's employees, overcame many difficulties and innovated many technologies, enabling this small machinery factory, which could only manufacture ten air-pressure hydraulic presses in the past, to manufacture 3,000-ton hydraulic presses with 250 air pressure, such heavy-duty mechanical equipment. This Chollima Youth Work Team recently relied on collective wisdom to create a clamp for processing vacuum pump piston expansion rings. In the coal industry sector, the movement initiated by the Lee Seung-hwan Chollima Work Team of the Aoji Coal Mine to mine 10,000 tons of coal per month from each coal mining face played a huge role in increasing coal production. In the second half of this year, a large number of work teams participating in the Chollima Work Team movement broke through the level of mining 10,000 tons of coal per month.

A feature of the continued development of the Chollima Work Team Movement this year is: the communist spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation has been greatly promoted, and advanced assistance to the backward has become a new trend. In the Kangson Steel Plant, which first initiated this movement, nine Chollima Work Team leaders went to work in backward work teams. Chen Yingyuan, the leader of the No. 3 Electric Furnace Chollima Work Team, went to work at the No. 5 Electric Furnace, the most backward in the entire factory and which had consistently failed to complete its production plan. He quickly helped the workers in this work team overcome the phenomenon of disunity, and also helped them study the Party's policies and improve steelmaking technology. As a result, starting in July, this electric furnace overfulfilled its production plan every month and became an advanced furnace. The participants in the Chollima Work Team Movement of the Kangson Steel Plant also carried out mutual assistance and cooperation this year under the slogan "For the Next Shift." They tried their best to solve any accidents or problems in production within their own team after taking over the shift, without leaving them to the next shift. Due to the prevalence of mutual assistance in a workshop in this factory, it now only takes half an hour to change the rolling mill rolls, but in the past, it took more than three hours. The work teams of various agricultural cooperatives participating in the Chollima Work Team movement also launched work to help backward members catch up with the advanced.

The Chollima Work Team Movement has also achieved great results in other departments. Zheng Chengji, the head of the ophthalmology department of Pyongyang Medical University Hospital and the leader of the Chollima Work Team, promoted a high degree of communist spirit of serving patients. After hard work and experimentation, he finally mastered the very complex corneal transplantation surgery, enabling more than 500 blind people to see again.

The widespread development of the Chollima Work Team Movement has also greatly promoted the improvement of the working people's political consciousness and technical and cultural level. Every Chollima Work Team vigorously carried out revolutionary tradition education, widely read the memoirs of Kim Il-sung's anti-Japanese guerrillas, and studied the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary predecessors. They also widely carried out collective movements to study technology and culture. The Jin Wanfeng Chollima Work Team of the Second Workshop of the Yong'an Chemical Factory carried out a collective movement to study technology, teaching and learning from each other, and in one year, the average technical level of all workers in the team increased from 4.2 to 5.7. Many Chollima Work Teams have formulated collective study plans, requiring all members of the team to reach the level of technician or engineer in technology and junior high school graduation or higher in culture within five or six years. Now, these work teams are effectively implementing their study plans.

    推动国民经济迅速向前发展　提高劳动人民共产主义觉悟
    朝鲜千里马作业班运动成就巨大
    参加者从工人扩大到农民和文教工作者　形成了全民性群众运动
    据新华社平壤15日电　本社记者报道：朝鲜工人阶级在去年春天发起的新型的社会主义竞赛——千里马作业班运动，在今年一年内有了更为广泛、更为全面的发展。现在，这个运动已经成为朝鲜人民经济迅速发展的巨大推动力，成为觉悟了的劳动人民参加经济管理的好方法，成为把人改造为共产主义新人的共产主义学校。
    进入今年以来，这个运动发展的一个特别突出的特点是：运动发展的范围越来越广，它已经成为一个全民性的群众运动。目前，除广大的工人外，各地的农民、文化、教育、科学和医务工作者都涌入了这一运动的洪流。参加运动的人数和作业班数目，由去年年底的五万人、二千六百四十六个作业班，迅速增加到目前的三十二万多人、一万六千七百多个作业班。现在，全国已经有八百六十八个作业班荣获千里马作业班的光荣称号，这比今年年初增加了四倍多。另外，现在参加这一运动的劳动人民已经不仅仅是创建千里马作业班了，他们还要创建千里马车间、千里马工厂、千里马学校、千里马医院等等。
    千里马作业班运动是在生产和技术方面大胆打破保守主义、神秘主义、掀起大革新的运动。它对推动今年的生产、提高劳动生产率和开展技术革新都起了巨大作用。平安南道参加这个运动的一千四百多个作业班，在今年10月以前的十二个月中就把劳动生产率提高了33％。咸镜南道参加这个运动的劳动者在9月份就有90％以上的人提前完成了全年的生产任务。根据五百个获得千里马作业班称号的作业班的统计材料，它们在获得这一称号后的六个月内，劳动生产率比获得这一称号前的六个月提高了31.4％；而在机器制造业中则提高了56％。
    今年在响应朝鲜劳动党的号召开展全面的技术革新运动中，每一个千里马作业班都带头打先锋。龙城机械工厂朱成一千里马青年作业班今年同全厂的职工一起，克服了重重的困难，革新了许多项技术，使这个规模不大的、过去只能造十个气压的水压机的机械厂制造出了二百五十个气压的三千吨水压机这样重型的机械设备。这个千里马青年作业班最近又依靠集体的智慧，创造出一种加工真空泵活塞涨圈的卡具。在煤炭工业部门，阿吾地煤矿李承焕千里马作业班发起的每个采煤掌子面每月采煤一万吨的运动，对增产煤炭起了巨大的作用。在今年下半年，大批参加千里马作业班运动的作业班突破了每月采煤一万吨的水平。
    千里马作业班运动在今年继续发展的一个特点是：互相帮助、互相协作等共产主义精神大大发扬了，先进帮助落后已经成为一种新风气。在首先发起这一运动的降仙炼钢厂，就有九个千里马作业班班长到落后作业班去工作。三号电炉千里马作业班班长陈应源到了全厂最落后、一直完不成生产计划的五号电炉去工作。他很快就帮助这个作业班的工人们克服了不团结的现象，又帮助了他们学习党的政策，提高炼钢技术，结果从7月份开始这座电炉就月月超额完成生产计划，成为一座先进炉。降仙炼钢厂的千里马作业班运动的参加者们，今年还在“为了下一班”的口号下，进行互相帮助和协作。他们接班后在生产上有什么事故或问题都尽量在本班内解决，而不留给下一班。这个厂的一个车间由于大兴互相帮助的风气，现在换轧钢机的轧辊，只要半个小时就行了，但在过去就需要三个多小时。参加千里马作业班运动的各个农业社的作业班，也展开了帮助落后社员赶上先进的工作。
    千里马作业班运动在其他部门中也获得了巨大的成绩。平壤医科大学医院眼科科长、千里马作业班班长郑成姬，发扬高度的为病人服务的共产主义精神，经过刻苦钻研和实验，终于掌握了很复杂的角膜移植手术，使五百多个盲人睁开了眼睛。
    千里马作业班运动的广泛发展，对提高劳动人民的政治觉悟和技术、文化水平也起了巨大的推动作用。每个千里马作业班都大力开展革命传统教育，广泛阅读金日成抗日游击队的回忆录，学习革命先辈的革命精神。他们还广泛开展集体学习技术和文化的运动。永安化学工厂第二车间金万峰千里马作业班开展集体学习技术的运动，互教互学，在一年内使全班工人的平均技术级别由四点二级提高到五点七级。许多千里马作业班都订出集体学习的计划，要在五、六年内使班内全体成员在技术上都达到技术员或技师的水平，在文化上达到初中毕业或更高的程度。现在，这些作业班都在有成效地执行学习计划。
