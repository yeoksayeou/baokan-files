　　Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, December 12th: The broad masses of working people in Bulgaria continue to actively participate in voluntary labor during holidays and spare time, developing public services and supporting agricultural cooperatives, and have achieved new successes.

　　According to statistical materials recently published by relevant Bulgarian departments, in the first nine months of this year, a total of 4,100,094 people in Bulgaria participated in voluntary labor, creating wealth for the country worth 116,529,363 leva (Bulgarian currency). This figure is 16,529,000 leva more than the entire last year.

　　Residents' voluntary labor is carried out under the leadership of the Fatherland Front at all levels, mainly to organize public welfare undertakings, such as building reading rooms, elementary schools, nurseries, repairing streets and parks, planting flowers, trees, and supporting agricultural production cooperatives during busy farming seasons.

　　Residents' participation in rural labor includes autumn harvest, summer harvest, and repairing irrigation canals. In the first half of this year alone, more than 90,000 people from various cities in the Ruse region went to the countryside to support agricultural production cooperatives, and more than 37,000 people from Sofia went to the countryside to support agricultural production. In addition, this year, some government agencies and enterprises in some cities have also signed contracts with agricultural production cooperatives to carry out regular and quantitative voluntary labor, mobilizing the masses to organize "hometown labor teams" to support agricultural production cooperatives in their hometowns.

    保劳动人民广泛参加义务劳动
    新华社索非亚12日电　保加利亚广大劳动人民继续利用假日和业余时间积极参加义务劳动，兴办公共事业和支援农业合作社，并且获得了新的成就。
    据保加利亚有关部门最近发表的统计材料，今年头九个月中，保加利亚共有四百一十万四千零九十四人参加了义务劳动，为国家创造了价值为一亿一千六百五十二万九千三百六十三列弗（保币）的财富，这个数字比去年全年还多一千六百五十二万九千列弗。
    居民义务劳动是在祖国阵线各级组织领导下进行的，主要是举办公益事业，如修建读书室、小学校、托儿所，修整街道公园，种植花草树木以及农忙季节支援农业生产合作社等。
    居民参加农村劳动包括秋收、夏收和修水渠等。仅今年上半年，鲁西州的各城市就有九万多人到农村去支援农业生产合作社，索非亚市有三万七千多人曾到乡下支援农业生产。此外，今年有些城市的机关和企业还与农业生产合作社签订了去进行定期定量的义务劳动的合同，发动群众组织“同乡劳动队”支援家乡的农业生产合作社。
