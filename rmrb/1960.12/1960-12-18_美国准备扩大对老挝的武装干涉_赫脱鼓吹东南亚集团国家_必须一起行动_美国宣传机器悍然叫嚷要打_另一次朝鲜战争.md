Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 16th. U.S. Secretary of State Herter advocated on the 16th that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization should be used to further armed intervention in the Laotian situation. He clamored that "Laos may involve (the West's) fate in Southeast Asia," so "the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization countries must act together" to deal with this "challenge" with "strength and will."

At a closed-door meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Ministerial Council held here, Herter tried his best to drag other Western countries into the water in order to jointly carry out large-scale intervention in Laos. Prior to this, Herter had held talks with the British and French Foreign Ministers on this matter. It was revealed that when Herter spoke at the secret meeting of the Council, he blatantly advocated expanding the rebellion in Laos to further obstruct the policy of peace and neutrality, national harmony, and national unity in Laos. He emphasized that the U.S. position on the Laotian situation is that Laos should have a "government friendly to the West" that excludes so-called "Communists."

Herter clearly expressed support for the Nosavan-Vong traitorous clique in Laos and opposed the Phouma legitimate government. He said that the existence of the puppet regime cobbled together by the Nosavan traitorous clique holding some parliamentarians has "deprived" the Phouma government of "any legitimate power," and clamored that the West "must never consider" "compromising" with the patriotic forces of Laos, and the West "must seek a solution to the Laotian problem within the scope of this policy."

At the same time, Herter tried to shift the responsibility for the deteriorating situation in Laos to the Soviet Union. He fabricated rumors that the Soviet Union provided the Phouma government with military weapons, saying that the Soviet Union "has never respected the political neutrality of Laos." He also shamelessly embellished the United States' consistent crimes of undermining the Geneva Accords and brutally interfering in Laos, and made it seem as if the United States has always "complied with" the Geneva Accords.

State Department spokesman White made a statement in Washington on the same day, openly stating that the United States will step up providing "assistance" to the Nosavan traitorous clique to support the expansion of the rebellion by this traitorous clique under the wing of the United States. White emphasized that Vong had made a request seeking U.S. "assistance," and the U.S. government is giving this request "rapid and sympathetic consideration." At the same time, White tirelessly once again slandered the Soviet Union for providing military weapons to the legitimate government of Laos, and slandered the troops of the legitimate government of Laos for shelling the "most densely populated" areas of Vientiane, in an attempt to shift the blame for the shelling of residential areas in Vientiane by the Thai interventionist army supported by the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, December 17th. According to Western news agencies: While U.S. imperialism is fully supporting and directing its lackey, the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group, to launch a frenzied attack on Vientiane, the capital of the Kingdom of Laos, Agence France-Presse reported from Washington on the 16th that "Far East experts" in the U.S. government openly declared that Laos "may become a new Korea."

The U.S. propaganda machine is also shamelessly advocating conducting "another Korean War" in Laos in order to prepare public opinion for the United States to collude with its vassal states to openly intervene in Laos with armed forces.

United Press International issued a dispatch from Vientiane on the 15th, saying that the Chinese government and people's righteous stance of condemning the U.S. aggression against Laos is a "new threat of intervention by Communist China," and clamored that if China "intervenes," "outside Western forces will definitely join in, thereby turning Laos into a new Korea."

The agency's reporter Potts also clamored in a dispatch from Washington on the 14th, "Unless the (Laotian) war ends quickly, this small-scale war may develop into another Korean War." Potts quoted the views of U.S. officials, demanding that Britain and France "unite" with the United States to jointly intervene in Laos with armed forces. He also revealed the U.S. conspiracy to split Laos. He said: "If Nosavan fails in the battle in Vientiane... or it may split the country (Laos) as in Korea and Vietnam."

An editorial in the New York Times, mouthpiece of the U.S. ruling clique, on the 13th slandered the Soviet Union for "direct military intervention" in Laos, and clamored that this is "an open challenge to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization." The newspaper clamored that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization "has the responsibility" to "take action" to "provide security" for Laos.

A dispatch from Manila by the Associated Press on the 16th admitted that the U.S. Seventh Fleet is "undoubtedly" preparing for armed intervention in Laos. It said, "Since September, a battle-ready battalion of (U.S.) Marines has been patrolling the South China Sea between the Philippines and Southeast Asia on aircraft carriers." The U.S. Navy can transport the Marines to Laos by helicopter within a few hours.

The Associated Press said that as early as September, U.S. Navy Commander Carson in the Philippines told its reporters that the U.S. "Marines are deployed on aircraft carriers because of the crisis in Laos." Carson also threatened that the aircraft on the U.S. aircraft carriers "patrolling" in the South China Sea have a "strike range" that can reach any location in Southeast Asia. Carson even blatantly talked about the specific military deployment for armed intervention in Laos, saying that after the U.S. Marines "initially land in Laos, they will be supported by a division stationed on Okinawa, which can be transported there by air force planes or fleet."

U.S. Pacific Air Force Commander O'Donnell, who is active in Taiwan, also clamored when talking about the situation in Laos in Taipei that the U.S. Air Force in the Pacific region is "always on standby."

    美国准备扩大对老挝的武装干涉
    赫脱鼓吹东南亚集团国家“必须一起行动”
    美国宣传机器悍然叫嚷要打“另一次朝鲜战争”
    新华社巴黎16日电　美国国务卿赫脱16日鼓吹利用东南亚条约组织进一步武装干涉老挝局势。他叫嚷，“老挝可能牵涉（西方在）东南亚的命运”，因此“东南亚条约组织国家必须一起行动起来”，用“实力和意志”去应付这个“挑战”。
    赫脱在这里举行的北大西洋集团部长理事会例会的秘密会议上竭力设法把其他西方国家拖下水，以便共同来对老挝进行大规模的干涉。在此以前，赫脱曾经与英、法外长就这件事举行过会谈。据透露，赫脱在理事会秘密会议上发言时露骨地主张扩大在老挝的叛乱，以进一步阻挠和平中立、民族和睦和国家统一的政策在老挝实现。他强调，美国对老挝局势的立场是：老挝应当有一个“对西方友好的”政府，这个政府要把所谓“共产党分子”排除在外。
    赫脱明白表示支持老挝的诺萨万—文翁叛国集团，反对富马合法政府。他说什么诺萨万叛国集团挟持部分议员拼凑起来的傀儡政权的存在已经“剥夺了”富马政府的“任何合法权力”，并且叫嚷说，西方“绝不能考虑”同老挝的爱国力量“妥协”，西方“必须在这个政策的范围内谋求老挝问题的解决。”
    赫脱同时力图把老挝局势恶化的责任推给苏联。他捏造苏联向富马政府提供军火武器的谣言，说什么苏联“一直没有尊重老挝的政治中立”。他还厚颜无耻地粉饰美国一贯破坏日内瓦协议、粗暴干涉老挝的罪行，把美国说得好像是一直“遵守”日内瓦协议。
    国务院发言人怀特同一天在华盛顿发表谈话，公开表示美国将加紧向诺萨万叛国集团提供“援助”，以支持在美国卵翼下的这个叛国集团扩大叛乱。怀特强调说，文翁已提出了谋求美国“援助”的要求，美国政府对这个要求“正给予迅速和同情的考虑”。怀特同时不厌其烦地又一次诬蔑苏联向老挝合法政府提供军火武器，并且诽谤老挝合法政府的军队炮轰万象“居民最稠密”的地区，力图转嫁美国支持下的泰国干涉军炮轰万象居民区的罪行。
    据新华社17日讯　据西方通讯社报道：当美帝国主义正在全力支持和指挥它的走狗富米·诺萨万叛乱集团对老挝王国首都万象疯狂进攻的时候，法新社16日自华盛顿报道，美国政府的“远东问题专家”公然宣称老挝“可能成为一个新的朝鲜”。
    美国的宣传机器也正悍然鼓吹在老挝进行“另一次朝鲜战争”，以便为美国纠集仆从国家公开武装干涉老挝准备舆论。
    美国通讯社合众国际社15日从万象发出一条电讯，把中国政府和人民谴责美国侵略老挝的正义立场说成是什么“共产党中国进行干涉的新威胁”，并且叫嚣说，如果中国进行“干涉”，“外界的西方部队肯定会参加进来，从而把老挝变成一个新的朝鲜”。
    这家通讯社的记者波茨14日从华盛顿发出的一条电讯也叫嚷说，“除非（老挝）战事很快结束，否则这个小规模的战争可能发展成另一次朝鲜战争”。波茨引用美国官员的看法，要英、法两国同美国“联合起来”一起武装干涉老挝。他还透露了美国准备分裂老挝的阴谋。他说：“如果诺萨万在万象的战斗中失败……或者可能把这个国家
  （老挝）像在朝鲜和越南那样（加以）分裂。”
    美国统治集团的喉舌《纽约时报》13日的社论诬蔑苏联在老挝进行“直接的军事干预”，并且叫嚷说这是“对东南亚条约组织的一个公开挑战”。这家报纸鼓吹说，东南亚条约组织“有责任”为老挝“提供保障”而“采取行动”。
    美联社16日从马尼拉发出的一条电讯承认，美国第七舰队“毫无疑问”准备武装干涉老挝。它说，“自9月以来，一营作好战斗准备的（美国）海军陆战队一直乘搭航空母舰在菲律宾和东南亚之间的南中国海面上巡逻”，美国海军能够在几小时内用直升飞机把海军陆战队送到老挝登陆。
    美联社说，早在9月间美国驻菲律宾海军司令卡逊就曾经对它的记者说，美国“海军陆战队所以部署在航空母舰上，是由于老挝的危机”。卡逊还恫吓地说，正在南中国海“巡逻”的美国航空母舰上的飞机，其“打击范围”可以达到东南亚的任何地点。卡逊甚至露骨地谈到武装干涉老挝的具体军事部署说，美国海军陆战队“在老挝初步登陆后，将可以得到驻在冲绳岛的一个师的支持，这一师军队可以用空军飞机或舰队运到那里去”。
    正在台湾进行活动的美国太平洋空军司令奥当纳耳在台北谈老挝局势时也叫嚷说，太平洋地区的美国空军“随时都在枕戈待旦中”。
