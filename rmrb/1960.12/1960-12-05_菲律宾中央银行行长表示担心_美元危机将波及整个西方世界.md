Xinhua News Agency, Manila, 4th: The Governor of the Philippine Central Bank, Cuaderno, who just returned from the United States, stated on the 3rd that he was concerned that the economic crisis in the United States would affect the entire capitalist world.

He said, "The United States, due to its worsening payment situation, faces an economic recession and may be forced to adopt certain trade restrictions. These measures will certainly affect the whole world."

Cuaderno warned that the Philippines "must be wary of deficit spending." He said that the Philippines still faces serious problems regarding economic development. According to United Press International, "this clearly refers to the economic situation in the United States."

Cuaderno attended the International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington and held talks there with World Bank officials, negotiating the issue of a $47 million loan from this American-controlled bank to the Philippines.

Reports say that Cuaderno also held talks with newly elected U.S. President Kennedy's economic advisors during his stay in Washington.

    菲律宾中央银行行长表示担心
    美元危机将波及整个西方世界
    新华社4日讯　马尼拉消息：刚从美国回来的菲律宾中央银行行长卡德诺3日表示担心，美国的经济危机将影响整个资本主义世界。
    他说，“美国由于它的正在恶化的支付情况而面临着经济衰退，可能被迫采取某些限制贸易的办法。这些办法一定会影响全世界”。
    卡德诺警告说，菲律宾“要当心赤字开支”。他说，菲律宾仍面临着关于经济发展的严重问题。据合众国际社说，“这显然是指美国的经济情况而言”。
    卡德诺出席了在华盛顿举行的国际货币基金组织的会议，并在那里同世界银行负责人员举行了会谈，谈判这家美国控制下的银行给菲律宾一笔四千七百万美元贷款的问题。
    消息说，卡德诺在华盛顿期间还同新当选的美国总统肯尼迪的经济顾问举行了会谈。
