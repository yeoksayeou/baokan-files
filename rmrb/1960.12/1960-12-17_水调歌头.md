    Shui Diao Ge Tou
    (The China Chaozhou Opera Troupe Performs "Chen San Wu Niang" in Phnom Penh)
    China and Cambodia enjoy good relations, sending new sounds overseas. People vie to watch the story of Wu Niang, its sorrows and joys moving Phnom Penh. Happily meeting and falling in love during the lantern festival, startled by the betrothal gift of lychees outside the building, a beautiful dream hard to realize. Choosing to sell herself into servitude rather than submit, vowing to die resisting the tyrant.

    Saddened by the frail willow, pitying the paired butterflies, guarding their former pledge. Relying on her little maid's discreet help, she schemes to protect her love. People wish for reunion and happiness, the nation wishes for peaceful construction, the world wishes to end all aggression. Frequent exchanges of song and dance, lasting peace for a hundred generations!

    水调歌头
    （中国潮剧团在金边演出《陈三五娘》）
    中柬邦交好，海外送新声。争看五娘遗事，哀乐动金城。灯市欣逢心许，楼外惊蒙投荔，好梦苦难成。卖身甘役辱，矢死抗豪横。
    伤弱柳，怜双蝶，守前盟。赖他小婢周旋，百计护多情。人愿团圆康乐，国愿和平建设，举世绝侵凌。歌舞频来往，百代永安宁！
