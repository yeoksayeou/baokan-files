(Dispatch from our newspaper in Nanchang, December 11th) The commercial departments of Pingxiang City, Jiangxi Province, are carrying out rural market trade activities that combine material exchange, policy propaganda, and cultural entertainment, utilizing the unified rest days for commune members stipulated by the communes, which are deeply welcomed by the commune members. In the past three months, twelve rural people's communes in the city have carried out fourteen "three-combination" market trade activities, attracting nearly 60,000 commune members to participate, with a total sales volume of approximately 700,000 yuan.

In order to promote production, invigorate the rural economy, and boost the market, the commercial departments of Pingxiang City, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, have been paying close attention to the important link of rural fair trade since the beginning of this year, and have restored and developed rural markets such as "Fengxu" (periodic market), "Ganji" (market day), "Night Markets," "Dew Markets," and "Temple Fairs," which have played a significant role in stimulating the rural economy. Since the launch of the increased production and thrift movement centered on grain and steel, the new situation of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production requires further promotion of production and the invigoration of the rural economy. To this end, the Pingxiang commercial departments took the initiative to conduct an in-depth investigation and research on the rural market in the Luxi Commune, and found that the purchasing and selling activities of some rural fairs were not active enough, and some commune members were not very clear about the Party's purchasing policies and market management policies. In response to this situation, the commercial departments conducted several pilot projects of "three-combination" rural markets in the Luxi Commune. That is, under the unified leadership and management of the commune Party committee, with the local state-owned stores as the mainstay, and with the cooperation of banking, taxation, grain, market management, and cultural and educational departments, they divided the work and cooperated, based on the needs of benefiting production, facilitating the purchasing and selling of communes and brigade members, saving labor and time, and implementing the principle of combining work and rest. They mobilized the commune members to use the unified rest days stipulated by the commune to come to the rural market towns to conduct transactions. Here, the commune members exchanged the commodities they produced, while watching and participating in various short and lively cultural performances. At the same time, the commune Party committee used various propaganda tools and cultural activities to conduct propaganda and education on purchasing and selling policies and the political situation for the masses. This form was welcomed by the broad masses of commune members. The number of people participating in "three-combination" market transactions, the quantity and variety of materials, and the amount of purchases and sales all increased with each iteration. The Pingxiang Municipal Party Committee promptly summarized this experience and promoted it to all rural communes in the city.

The "three-combination" rural market has many advantages. First, this market is closely integrated with the rest and cultural life of commune members, which is conducive to implementing the principle of "combining work and rest," and thus can attract a wider range of people to participate, resulting in more transactions, more goods, and more varieties.

Second, this market is larger in scale and broader in transaction content, thus further promoting diversified operations and increasing the collective or individual income of the commune. Under the promotion of this market trade, the Yaxi Brigade of the Baizhu Commune has planned to organize commune members to restore and develop collective sideline production, such as weaving mats, firing ceramics, and baking baskets, pottery, etc. Some commune members also use their evening time to produce small commodities such as chopsticks, bamboo shells for thermos bottles, water ladles, and brooms. Through a single "three-combination" market transaction, the entire brigade increased its average cash income by 2.40 yuan per person.

Third, this market enables the Party's various financial and trade policies to directly meet the masses, and promotes the completion of various financial and trade tasks. (Attached picture)

Since the winter, the Chengguan People's Commune of Wenxi County, Shanxi Province, has developed market trade, invigorated the rural economy, and the market has presented a prosperous scene. During the holidays, the commune members of each production team bring their own agricultural and sideline products and household sideline products to the market for transactions according to their own needs. This is the commune's supply and marketing cooperative's native product purchasing station, which is purchasing various native products brought by the commune members.

### 交流物资、宣传政策、文化娱乐“三结合”  萍乡农村市场办得好

    交流物资、宣传政策、文化娱乐“三结合”
    萍乡农村市场办得好
    本报南昌11日电　江西省萍乡市商业部门利用公社统一规定的社员休假日，开展交流物资、宣传政策、文化娱乐“三结合”的农村市场贸易活动，深受社员群众欢迎。全市在最近三个月内，有十二个农村人民公社开展“三结合”市场贸易活动十四次，吸引了近六万名社员参加，各项购销总金额达七十万元左右。
    为了促进生产、活跃农村经济，繁荣市场，萍乡市商业部门在党委的统一领导下，从今年以来，一直十分注意抓农村集市贸易这一重要环节，分别恢复和发展了“逢圩”、“赶集”、“夜市”、“露水圩”、“庙会”等农村集市，对活跃农村经济起了很大作用。自从以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动开展以后，大办农业大办粮食的新形势，要求进一步促进生产、活跃农村经济。为此，萍乡商业部门又主动在芦溪公社对农村市场作了一次深入的调查研究，发现有些农村集市的购销活动还不够十分活跃，有些社员对党的收购政策、市场管理政策等，还不十分明了。针对这一情况，商业部门便在芦溪公社搞了几次“三结合”农村市场的试点。即在公社党委的统一领导和管理下，以当地国营商店为主，银行、税收、粮食、市场管理和文教部门配合，分工协作，本着有利生产，便利公社和大队社员购销的需要，节省劳力和时间，贯彻劳逸结合的原则，发动社员群众利用公社统一规定的休假日，到农村圩镇上来进行交易。在这里，社员们一面交换自己生产的商品，一面观看和参加各种短小活泼的文娱演唱节目；同时，公社党委又通过各种宣传工具和各种文娱活动，对群众进行购销政策和政治形势的宣传教育。这种形式获得了广大社员的欢迎。参加“三结合”市场交易的人次、物质数量品种、购销金额，都一次比一次增长。中共萍乡市委及时总结了这一经验，向全市各农村公社推广。
    “三结合”的农村市场，有很多好处。首先，这种市场与社员的休息、文化生活紧密结合了起来，有利于贯彻“劳逸结合”的原则，因而能够吸收更广泛的群众参加，达到交易的人多、物多、品种多。
    其次，这种市场规模较大，交易内容广，因而更大地促进了多种经营，增加了公社的集体或个人收入。白竺公社垭溪大队在这种市场贸易的促进下，有计划地组织社员恢复和发展集体副业生产，如打席子、烧陶瓷、烘笼钵瓦等等。有的社员还利用晚上时间生产筷子、热水瓶竹壳、水杓、扫帚等小商品。通过一次“三结合”市场的交易，就使全大队平均每人增加了现金收入二元四角。
    第三，这种市场使党的各项财贸政策与群众直接见面，促进了各项财贸任务的完成。（附图片）
    山西省闻喜县城关人民公社开展集市贸易，活跃农村经济，入冬以来，集市呈现一派繁荣景象。在假日里，各生产队的社员带着自己生产的和采集的农副土特产品和家庭副业产品到集市上，根据名自的需要进行交易。这是公社供销店土特产品收购站正在收购社员们带来的各种土特产品。　　　　　　　新华社记者　张瑞华、董荣贵摄
