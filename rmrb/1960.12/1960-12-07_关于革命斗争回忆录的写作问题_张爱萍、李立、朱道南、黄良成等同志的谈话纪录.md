On the Writing of Memoirs of Revolutionary Struggles
Talks with Comrades Zhang Aiping, Li Li, Zhu Daonan, Huang Liangcheng, and others

The Purpose and Motivation for Writing Memoirs of Revolutionary Struggles

The common writing purpose and motivation of authors of revolutionary struggle memoirs is to educate future generations to understand the arduousness of the revolution and the difficulty of achieving victory and happiness; to elucidate how Mao Zedong Thought guided the Chinese revolution to victory, enabling people to recognize the experiences and lessons of revolutionary history; and to express deep love and gratitude to the Party, comrades-in-arms, the masses of people, and all heroic martyrs, and profound hatred for the enemy.

For example, when we interviewed Comrade Zhang Aiping, the author of memoirs such as "From Zunyi to the Dadu River," he said, "There must be a purpose for doing anything. The purpose of writing memoirs is to write down the true events of the revolution led by the Party to educate future generations. We want to let the people of the whole country and our future generations, as well as the people of the world, know how the Chinese revolution has come about over the past few decades, what kind of party the Chinese Communist Party is, what kind of people the Chinese people are, and what kind of army the Chinese People's Revolutionary Army is. No strong enemy can defeat us, and we have defeated many strong enemies and overcome many difficulties. This is all because we have the correct leadership of the great and wise Chairman Mao, and the arduous struggle of the broad masses of soldiers and civilians and revolutionary cadres who have stepped forward one after another. We must tell our next generation: the success of the revolution and the acquisition of a happy life are not easy. They should understand the hardships of the past struggle and should never forget the revolutionary martyrs.

Comrade Zhang Aiping specifically talked about his purpose and motivation for writing "From Zunyi to the Dadu River." He said, "That was after the national liberation, and I had an idea in my mind: the great action of the Red Army's 25,000-li Long March is not only of great political significance, but also a remarkable historical event in military terms. It once shook the world and was praised by the people of the world. Today, it should be written so that our people, the people of the world, and our future generations will know. What should be especially shown here is Chairman Mao's military thought and his genius in predicting the enemy like a god - the strategic and tactical art of flexible and mobile large-scale warfare. Before the Zunyi Conference, due to the 'Left' leaning opportunist leadership, the Red Army was blocked, surrounded, and chased by the enemy, on the verge of total annihilation, and the revolution was in extremely dangerous moment. At this time, the Party convened the Zunyi Conference, which established Chairman Mao's leadership. Since then, the Red Army has overcome strong enemies and all difficulties, turned danger into safety, and moved from failure to victory. Historical experience has proved that the revolution is victorious under the leadership of Chairman Mao, and fails under the leadership of 'Left' and Right leaning opportunism, and pays a great sacrifice and price. Although sacrifices and costs are also paid under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the sacrifices and costs paid are minimal, and in exchange for greater victories." Then, Comrade Zhang Aiping said, "Decades of struggle have made me deeply realize Chairman Mao's wisdom, greatness and correctness. It is based on this feeling that I wrote "From Zunyi to the Dadu River." Comrade Zhang Aiping also mentioned that, in addition to this, he also wanted to express the political quality and morale of the People's Army, the bravery of the soldiers, the class friendship of unity from top to bottom, and the close relationship between the army and the people through this memoir. In particular, it is necessary to express those comrades who bravely sacrificed for the revolution.

Comrade Li Li, the author of memoirs such as "Fighting North and South" and "Forty-Eight Days," Comrade Zhu Daonan, the author of memoirs such as "Recalling the Guangzhou Uprising," and Comrade Huang Liangcheng, the author of "Recalling the Long March," also expressed similar views when talking about their purpose of writing memoirs.

Comrade Huang Liangcheng said that his purpose in writing "Recalling the Long March" was to "inspire young people to love the Party, love the new society, conscientiously inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of the revolution, maintain the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle, not be afraid of difficulties, and strive for the construction of socialism-communism." In addition, he also specifically talked about how he wrote due to the memory of the Long March and the comrades in the Long March.

He said: "The great Long March (I experienced two years and eight months from departing Jiangxi to northern Shaanxi) cultivated me and tempered me. Just as an infant will not forget his mother, I will always miss the Long March. Every stage of the Long March is extraordinary, and will always be deeply remembered in my heart. The Red Army is a united and fighting big family. In the long and arduous fighting life together, the friendship between class brothers is hundreds and thousands of times better than that of brothers from the same mother. Especially those comrades who share life and death, share hardships and are inseparable every day, and those events related to themselves, are even more indelibly imprinted in their minds. For example, I remember very clearly events such as being wounded, the snowy mountains and grasslands, the failure of the Western Route Army, and escaping danger and returning to the team; Like martyr Li Bai and other comrades, their voices and smiles are still vivid in my mind. If I don't write these things down, I can't calm down.

"...Comrade Li Bai appeared in front of me as if he were alive, tall, gentle voice, steady strides, and a smiling face... It always appears in front of my eyes. It is based on this unforgettable feeling for the Long March and the comrades in the Long March, and it is in such a deep memory that I wrote "Recalling the Long March."

Comrade Zhu Daonan also talked about how he wrote memoirs such as "Recalling the Guangzhou Uprising" based on his unforgettable memory of revolutionary comrades and his sense of responsibility for educating young people. He said:

"From 1926 to 1929, I personally experienced the 'May 21st Incident' and the 'Guangzhou Uprising'. After the failure of the uprising, I went to Hailufeng with the comrades who participated in the uprising to find Comrade Peng Pai. On the way, the Fourth Division of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army was established. After countless battles, it joined forces with the Second Division of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. During this period, I saw the unparalleled revolutionary enthusiasm and the extremely firm fighting will of the workers and peasants. In extremely difficult circumstances, they fought against the reactionaries with bare arms and red tasseled spears and pointed skewers (sharpened Mao bamboo). I also saw how the Kuomintang reactionaries destroyed the Great Revolution, how brutal they were, and how outwardly strong but inwardly weak they were. During this period, I was taught by Party leaders such as Yun Daiying, Zhang Tailei, Peng Pai, Ye Ting, and Ye Jianying, which quickly improved my understanding and awareness. Their glorious images are unforgettable for life. We have experienced countless dangers and countless cruel battles, and paid a huge price. Several of my closest comrades who came out of Shandong with me—Liu Hui, died with the enemy by pulling the grenade at the failure of the 'Guangzhou Uprising'; Gong Jinshou, who used his shoulder as a gun mount while defending Guanyin Mountain, was sacrificed when he hit Puning. At that time, he was wounded in several places, still insisted on fighting, and used his body to attract the enemy's attention, covering us to attack the city, and his leg was seriously injured, but he refused to put down his gun; Yang Di, who had been in the army, suffered disasters in Lufeng; Xie Zhuomin, who became a battalion commander in 1928, led his troops to carry out activities in the new district and achieved great results. Later, the troops failed, and his whereabouts are unknown. It is estimated that he also sacrificed. I have kept all this in mind for thirty years. Whenever I think of them, I can't calm down. When encountering difficulties at work, they increase my courage; when work goes smoothly, they help me overcome pride. I often think this way: how rugged and difficult the road we have traveled in the past. Now how wide and smooth the road we are walking, this is paved for us with the blood of those martyrs who sacrificed themselves, we should not have a little hesitation and shrinking when we encounter some temporary difficulties on this road, right? When our work is going smoothly and we have achieved certain achievements, can there be any pride and complacency? Therefore, I always want to write out the noble qualities of those sacrificed comrades so that more people know about it, and I feel sorry for these nameless heroes if I don't." Comrade Zhu Daonan also said that the reason why he wanted to write this experience was also because he found that every time he talked to people about this experience, the other party was moved and educated.

In short, these memoir authors picked up their pens to write in such a lofty and sensible motivation and in a strong revolutionary enthusiasm.

How to Reflect the Truth of History and the Spirit of the Times

Regarding the authenticity of revolutionary struggle memoirs, Comrade Zhang Aiping said: "Since the memoirs are written about the history of revolutionary struggle, and are true people and true events, the authenticity of the memoirs is very important. Moreover, the revolutionary historical events themselves are admirable and touching, and the author does not need to fabricate anything. Many of our memoir works are full of revolutionary romanticism, because our revolutionary cause itself is rich in revolutionary romanticism. The Chinese people encountered the three fierce enemies of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and we dared to fight against the enemy with our bare hands, overthrow them, defeat them, and dare to fight bravely and tenaciously for the lofty ideal of establishing a socialist and communist society in the future, isn't this itself full of revolutionary romanticism? Having lofty ideals, fighting against the enemy realistically, and progressing from nothing to something, from small to large, from victory and failure, to victory and failure again, to victory again, until the complete victory of the Chinese people's revolution, makes the struggle memoirs have the elements of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism."

Comrade Zhang Aiping also said: "The authenticity of memoirs is certainly important, but authenticity does not mean that everything must be written in, but to highlight the essence of history. We must write historical facts from the perspective of historical materialism."

Comrade Huang Liangcheng also said when talking about how to treat the truth of history: "I think the fundamental method is to study problems, analyze history, and summarize history with the thought of Marxism-Leninism, that is, historical materialism, and to make some cuts and selections, instead of using the method of mechanically copying historical materials to describe like a running account."

Comrade Li Li particularly pointed out: "We should seize those heroic figures who have a clear class position, have lofty ideals, are resolute in struggle, and are born and die for the victory of the revolution to write; seize those details that exude the spirit of communism to write, in order to express representative and typical figures and events. In this way, we can reflect the true face of history."

Comrade Zhu Daonan talked about how he reflected the spirit of the times by writing about characters. He said: "I think people, events, and the spirit of the times are integrated. When writing about people, we cannot be separated from events and cannot forget the spirit of the times; in addition to those places that are not easily understood by others, we must make some explanations to the readers, and the rest should be reflected through the activities of the characters as much as possible and connect them together. The actual situation is also the same. The activities of the characters can reflect the face of the times."

Artistic Processing and How the Author Deals with the Individual

Several comrades talked about memoirs need to be artistically processed, to express people, events, and the atmosphere of the environment vividly and vividly, otherwise it is not easy to arouse readers' interest, hold readers' heartstrings, so as to achieve a more effective educational purpose. However, artistic processing is not arbitrary fabrication. It is only some concrete and vivid artistic descriptions under the premise of conforming to historical truth. Comrade Zhang Aiping also specifically said: "Description and portrayal are subordinate, and the ideological significance of the work is the basic thing. Without these basic things, only attracting readers from the writing skills, or writing the plot in an unusually thrilling and tortuous way, or even fabricating some magical and strange stories or interspersing some petty-bourgeois sentiments and low-level interests, is not only meaningless, but also extremely wrong."

Regarding how to deal with the individual in the work. Comrade Zhang Aiping said: "Writing memoirs is to commend revolutionary predecessors and educate the people. Therefore, do not have a feeling of personal prominence, and do not take the opportunity to show yourself. It is even more unacceptable to take all the credit of the Party and comrades in the past struggle on oneself. This is a kind of 'embezzlement' in politics, and is taking advantage of the revolution. Individuals can certainly play a role in history, but the role of individuals is limited. Any individual will not have much effect if he leaves the Party and the masses. The key is whether the Party's line has been implemented and Chairman Mao's thought has been used. If the Party's line has been implemented and Chairman Mao's thought has been used, then anyone can do the same thing well. Therefore, it is not good to express the individual."

In addition to having the same views as Comrade Zhang Aiping on this issue, Comrade Huang Liangcheng also talked about that when necessary, one's own experience can be used as a clue to drive the entire story, and mainly write about the Party's leadership, the background of the times, and the heroic fighting scenes of the surrounding masses (comrades-in-arms and comrades). He also pointed out: Do not refuse to write revolutionary stories related to yourself because you are afraid of "individual prominence" and afraid of "showing off". As long as the viewpoint is correct and the measure is grasped appropriately, this problem can be solved.

    关于革命斗争回忆录的写作问题
    张爱萍、李立、朱道南、黄良成等同志的谈话纪录
    写作革命斗争回忆录的目的和动机
    为了要教育后代懂得革命的艰苦，懂得胜利和幸福来之不易；为了阐明毛主席思想如何指导中国革命走向胜利，使人认清革命历史的经验教训；为了表达自己对党、对战友、对人民群众及一切英雄烈士深切的敬爱和感念之情，对敌人的深刻的憎恨，这是革命斗争回忆录的作者们共同的写作目的和动机。
    例如我们访问《从遵义到大渡河》等篇回忆录的作者张爱萍同志时，他谈道：“做任何一件事总是要有个目的。把党领导的革命斗争历史的真实事情写出来教育后代，这就是写回忆录的目的。我们要让全国人民和我们的后代，以及全世界的人民都知道，中国革命几十年的道路是怎样走过来的，中国共产党是个什么样的党，中国人民是什么样的人民，中国的人民革命军队是什么样的一支军队。任何强敌是打不倒我们的，而我们曾经打败了许多强敌，克服了许多困难。这都是由于我们有伟大英明的毛主席的正确领导，有广大军民、革命干部前仆后继的艰苦斗争。我们要告诉我们的下一代：革命的成功，幸福生活的获得是多么不容易，应该懂得过去斗争的艰苦，应该对革命的先烈永志不忘。
    张爱萍同志具体谈到他写《从遵义到大渡河》的目的和动机。他说：“那是在全国解放以后，我心里就有个想法：红军的二万五千里长征这一伟大的行动，不仅在政治上有极大的意义，在军事上也是一个了不起的历史事迹。它曾经震动了世界，受到世界人民的歌颂。今天应该把它写出来，让我们的人民，让全世界的人民，以及我们的后代都知道。这里尤其应该表现的是毛主席的军事思想和他天才的料敌如神的作战指挥艺术——灵活机动的大规模的运动战的战略战术。在遵义会议前，由于‘左’倾机会主义领导，红军处于被敌人堵截、包围与追击下，濒于全军复没之境，革命处于极危险的时刻。在这时候党召开了遵义会议，确定了毛主席的领导，从此红军战胜了强敌和一切困难，转危为安，从失败走向了胜利。历史的经验证明了：革命凡是在毛主席领导下就胜利，而在‘左’右倾机会主义领导下则失败，且付出很大的牺牲和代价。在毛主席领导下虽然也付出牺牲和代价，但是付出的是极小的牺牲和代价，换来的是更大的胜利”。接着，张爱萍同志又谈道：“几十年的斗争使我深深体会到毛主席的英明、伟大和正确。就是基于这种感情，我写了《从遵义到大渡河》。”张爱萍同志又谈到，除此之外，还想通过这篇回忆录表现人民军队的政治品质和士气，表现战士们的英勇、上下团结的阶级友爱以及亲密无间的军民关系。尤其要表现那些为革命英勇牺牲的同志们。
    《转战南北》、《四十八天》等篇回忆录的作者李立同志、《回忆“广州起义”》等篇回忆录的作者朱道南同志、《忆长征》的作者黄良成同志等，谈到自己写作回忆录的目的时也都发表了类似的见解。
    黄良成同志说，他写作《忆长征》的目的是为了“启发青年更加热爱党，热爱新社会，兢兢业业地继承和发扬革命的光荣传统，保持艰苦奋斗的革命精神，不怕困难，为建设社会主义—共产主义而奋斗”。此外，他还特别谈到他是怎样由于忆念长征及长征中的战友而写作的。
    他说：“伟大的长征（从江西出发到陕北，我经历了二年又八个月）培养了我，锻炼了我，如同一个幼儿不会忘怀自己的母亲一样，我永远怀念长征。长征的每一段里程都是不平凡的，都永远深深铭记在我心中。红军是一个团结战斗的大家庭，在长期共同艰苦的战斗生活中，阶级兄弟情谊，胜过同母兄弟百倍千倍。特别是那些同生死、共患难，天天在一起形影不离的战友和那些与自己有关的事件，更在脑海里烙下不可磨灭的印象。如负伤、雪山草地、西路军失败、脱险归队等事件，我都记得很清楚；像李白烈士和其他战友，他们的音容笑貌，至今还历历如在眼前。如果不把这些东西写出来，我心里就不能平静。
    “……李白同志像活着一样，高高的个儿，温柔的声音，稳健的阔步，满脸的笑容……老在我眼前出现。就是基于对长征、对长征中的战友这种难忘的感情，就是处在这样深沉的回忆中，我写出了《忆长征》。”
    朱道南同志也谈到他是怎样基于对革命战友刻骨铭心的怀念和对青年人进行教育的责任感，写出了《回忆“广州起义”》等篇回忆录。他说：
    “我从1926年到1929年这三年间，亲身经历了‘马日事变’、‘广州起义’，起义失败后又和参加起义的同志奔向海陆丰去找彭湃同志。在中途，中国工农红军第四师成立了，经过无数次战斗，又与中国工农红军第二师会师。在这一段时间里，我看到了工农革命群众无比高涨的革命热情和无比坚定的斗争意志，他们在十分艰难的情况下，赤着膊用红缨枪和尖串（削尖的毛竹）与反动派搏斗。我也看到了国民党反动派是怎样破坏大革命的，他们是多么残暴，又多么外强中干。在这一段时间里，受到了恽代英、张太雷、彭湃、叶挺、叶剑英等党的领导同志的教导，使我的认识和觉悟很快的提高起来，他们的光辉形象使我终身难忘。我们经历了无数的艰险，进行了无数次的残酷战斗，付出了巨大代价。和我从山东一道出来的几位最亲密的战友——刘辉是在‘广州起义’失败时，拉响了手榴弹和敌人同归于尽的；坚守观音山时用肩头做炮架的公今寿，是在打普宁时牺牲的，当时他负伤数处，仍然坚持战斗，并用自己的身子吸引住敌人的注意，掩护我们攻上城头，腿上负了重伤，仍不肯放下枪杆；一直坚持在部队里的杨的，是在陆丰遭的难；1928年当了营长的谢拙民，领导部队在新区活动，取得了很大成绩，后来部队失败，他的音息全无，估计也是牺牲了。所有这一切，三十年来我一直铭记在心。一想起他们，我就不能平静。在工作遇到困难的时候，他们使我增长勇气；在工作顺利的时候，他们帮助我克服骄气。我常常这样想：过去所走的道路是多么的崎岖艰险呵。现在我们走着的道路又是多么宽广平坦，这是那些不惜牺牲自己的先烈们用鲜血给我们铺平的，我们在这条道路上前进时，如果遇到某些暂时的困难，难道应该有一点犹豫和畏缩吗？在自己的工作顺利和取得某些成就的时候，难道可以有丝毫的骄傲和自满吗？因此，我总想要把那些已牺牲的战友们的高贵品质写出来让更多的人知道，不这样就觉得对不起这些无名英雄。”朱道南同志又谈到他所以想把这段经历写出来，还因为他发觉每次向人谈到这段经历时，都使对方受到感动和教育。
    总之，这几位回忆录的作者就是在这样崇高可感的动机下，在浓郁的革命热情中拿起笔来写作的。
    如何反映历史的真实和时代精神
    关于对待革命斗争回忆录的真实性问题，张爱萍同志谈道：“回忆录既然写的是革命斗争历史，是真人真事，因此回忆录的真实性是非常重要的。而且革命历史事件本身就是可歌可泣，使人感动的，用不着作者再去虚构什么。我们有许多回忆录作品中充满了革命浪漫主义精神，就是因为我们革命事业本身就富有革命浪漫主义色彩。中国人民碰到帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义这样凶恶的三大敌人，而我们手无寸铁，赤手空拳地就敢于向敌人作斗争，推翻他们，打倒他们，敢于为将来要建立社会主义、共产主义社会的远大理想而英勇顽强的斗争，这本身不就是富有革命的浪漫主义么？既有远大理想，又实事求是地和敌人作斗争，并从无到有，从小到大，从胜利、失败，再胜利、再失败、再胜利，直到取得中国人民革命的完全胜利的革命斗争史实，就使得斗争回忆录可以有着革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的因素。”
    张爱萍同志又谈道：“回忆录的真实性固然重要，但真实性并不意味着，要把任何东西都写进去，而是要突出表现历史的精华。要以历史唯物论的观点去写历史事实。”
    黄良成同志在谈到如何对待历史的真实时，也说：“我认为，根本方法是以马克思列宁主义即历史唯物主义的思想，去研究问题，分析历史，总结历史，并有所剪裁和取舍，而不应该用机械地抄袭历史材料的方法，流水账似的去描写。”
    李立同志特别指出：“我们应该抓住那些阶级立场鲜明，有远大理想，斗争坚决，为革命胜利而出生入死的英雄人物来写；抓住那些散发着共产主义精神的细节来写，以期把有代表性的、有典型意义的人物和事件表现出来。这样我们就能够反映出历史的真实面貌。”
    朱道南同志谈到他是怎样通过写人物来反映时代精神的。他说：“我认为人、事件、时代精神是融为一体的。在写人的时候不能离开事件，不能忘记时代精神；除了那些别人看了不易理解的地方，要向读者作一些交代外，其余都尽量通过人物的活动把它反映出来，把它连贯起来。实际情况也是这样，人物的活动是能反映时代面貌的。”
      艺术加工及作者对个人如何处理的问题
    几位同志都谈到回忆录要进行一些艺术加工，要形象地生动地来表现人、事件、环境气氛，否则不容易引起读者兴趣，扣住读者心弦，从而达到更有效的教育目的。但是艺术加工并不是随意虚构，它只是在符合历史真象的前提下，进行一些具体形象的艺术描绘。张爱萍同志还特别谈道：“形容和描绘是从属的，作品的思想意义才是基本的东西。如果没有这些基本的东西，只为从写作技巧上吸引读者，或把故事情节写得异常惊险曲折，甚至虚构一些神奇古怪的故事或夹杂一些小资产阶级情调与低级趣味的东西，那不但没有意义，而且是极端错误的。”
    关于作品中对个人如何处理的问题。张爱萍同志谈道：“写回忆录是为了表彰革命先辈，教育人民。因此，不要有个人突出的感觉，不要借机表现自己。更不能把过去斗争中党和同志们的功劳都拉在自己的身上。这在政治上是一种‘贪污行为’，是揩革命的油。个人在历史上固然能起一点作用，但个人作用是有限的，任何个人如果离开党和群众都不会有多大作用。关键在于是否执行了党的路线，运用了毛主席的思想，如果执行了党的路线，运用了毛主席的思想，那么，同一件事哪一个人来做都可以做好。因此表现个人是很不好的。”
    对这个问题黄良成同志除与张爱萍同志有相同的看法外，还谈到，必要时可以以自己的经历作为一条线索，去牵动整个故事，而主要把党的领导、时代背景和周围群众（战友和同志）的英勇斗争场面写出来。他并且指出：不要因为害怕“个人突出”、怕“出风头”而不肯写与自己有关的革命故事。只要观点正确、分寸掌握恰如其分，这个问题是能够解决的。
