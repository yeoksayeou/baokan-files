Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 23rd: According to the Korean Central News Agency in Kaesong, the secretary of the Korean-Chinese side of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, at today's meeting of the secretaries of both sides, condemned the piratical act of the US side's naval vessels intruding into the northern coastal waters of Korea and forcibly kidnapping the fishing boats and fishermen of northern Korea, and lodged a strong protest with the US side regarding this.

The secretary of the Korean-Chinese side pointed out in his speech at the meeting: On the morning of December 19, some fishing boats from northern Korea, on their way back to their fishing ports after finishing fishing operations, were forcibly hijacked by US naval vessels in the sea near 37 degrees 40 minutes 50 seconds north latitude and 125 degrees 17 minutes 00 seconds east longitude in the northern coastal waters of Korea.

The secretary of the Korean-Chinese side pointed out that this provocative act by the US side is a violation of the armistice agreement. The secretary of the Korean-Chinese side strongly demanded that the US side must return the illegally kidnapped fishermen and their boats, as well as the cargo on board, to the Korean-Chinese side, and take responsible measures to prevent such incidents from happening again. However, the US side said at the meeting that it would conduct an "investigation" into the incident.

The secretary of the Korean-Chinese side immediately pointed out that this was an attempt to use "investigation" as an excuse to delay the fulfillment of the legitimate demands of the Korean-Chinese side, and once again emphasized the return of the illegally kidnapped fishermen from northern Korea to the Korean-Chinese side. At the same time, it was also pointed out that the US side must bear full responsibility for the personal safety of the kidnapped fishermen.

The secretary of the Korean-Chinese side finally pointed out that the Korean-Chinese side will continue to hold the US side accountable until the US side fulfills the demands of the Korean-Chinese side.

    抗议美舰劫走朝鲜渔民渔船
    新华社平壤23日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯，朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面秘书长，在今天举行的双方秘书长会议上谴责了美方海军舰艇侵入朝鲜北部沿海强行劫走朝鲜北部的渔船和渔民的海盗行为，并就此向美方提出强硬抗议。
    朝中方面秘书长在会上发言时指出：12月19日早晨，朝鲜北部的一些渔船在结束捕鱼作业返回自己的渔港的途中，在朝鲜北部沿海北纬三十七度四十分五十秒，东经一百二十五度十七分零零秒附近的海上，遭到美方海军舰艇的强行劫持。
    朝中方面秘书长指出，美方的这一挑衅行为是违反停战协定的。朝中方面秘书长强硬要求美方必须把非法劫去的渔民和他们的船只以及船上的货物送还朝中方面，并采取负责的措施防止此类事件再次发生。但是，美方在会上却说什么对这一事件要进行“调查”。
    朝中方面秘书长当即指出，这是企图以“调查”为借口，拖延履行朝中方面的正当要求，并再一次强调把非法劫去的朝鲜北部渔民送还朝中方面。同时又指出，美方必须对劫去的渔民的人身安全负完全责任。
    朝中方面秘书长最后指出，朝中方面将继续向美方追究责任，直到美方履行了朝中方面的要求时为止。
