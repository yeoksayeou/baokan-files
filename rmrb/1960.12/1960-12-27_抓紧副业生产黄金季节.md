    Seize the Golden Season for Sideline Production
    Develop Sidelines in Accordance with Local Conditions
    The Xinlinzhen People's Commune in Linxi County, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, while rationally arranging labor, has adopted measures suitable to local conditions to vigorously develop winter sideline production. Recently, it is the golden season for capturing wild birds and animals and cutting lamb's beard grass. The commune seized the opportunity and promptly formed 114 specialized teams. In the past month, they have cut more than 300,000 jin of grass and captured a large number of wild birds and animals.
    Conscientiously Solve Specific Problems
    The First Production Team of the Xiantu Management Area of the Baisha Commune in Yangxin County, Hubei Province, earnestly solves some specific problems in winter sideline production. For example, the production team vacated the office as a carpentry workshop, actively sought to borrow fans from other teams, allowing ironworkers and carpenters to quickly start production; the whole team has eleven members who can hunt, but only four indigenous guns are available. The production team invested 200 yuan to buy guns and ammunition, ensuring that all eleven members can go hunting in the mountains. Appropriate care is given in life to team members engaged in winter transportation, hunting, and other strenuous labor.
    Establish Temporary Specialized Fronts
    The Shacheng Brigade of the Shacheng Commune in Huailai County, Hebei Province, under the principle of not affecting agricultural production, has established a total of twenty-five temporary specialized sideline teams, factories, and groups, occupying 7% of the total labor force.
    The team also adopted different forms of labor organization according to different sideline production projects: pigs, poultry, bees, and rabbits are raised by combining centralized and decentralized breeding; repairing, manufacturing, weaving, and transporting are combined by fixed arrangements and flexible allocation. The use of these organizational forms not only ensures the labor force necessary for agricultural production, but also promotes the development of sideline production.
    Delineate Business Scope
    The Wangzhuang Brigade of the Wucheng Commune in Wuyang County, Henan Province, adheres to the production policy of simultaneously promoting collective sideline production and household sideline production, delineating the business scope of the brigade, team, and individual commune members: sideline industries with large scale and strong technicality (such as ironwork, carpentry, sewing, cotton ginning, etc.) are managed uniformly by the brigade; sideline industries with small investment and fast capital turnover (such as short-distance transportation, hunting, etc.) are managed by the team; sporadic sideline industries (such as raising poultry, digging medicinal herbs, household handicrafts, etc.) are managed by the commune members themselves, and the income belongs to each individual.
    Determine Reasonable Remuneration
    The management areas of the Changxing Commune in Antu County, Jilin Province, in hunting sideline production, reasonably determine labor remuneration in light of the specific conditions such as the cost of clothing, shoes, and difficult working conditions. Wufeng Management Area also extracts 3% of the total income of the hunting team as a reward for old hunters with high skills and large game value, making the new and old hunters more united, learning from each other, learning from each other's strengths and compensating for their weaknesses, greatly promoting hunting sideline production.
    Huiyang Hunting Achieves Initial Victory
    According to preliminary statistics, the winter hunting in Huiyang County, Guangdong Province, has captured seven tigers, one leopard, three black bears, two hundred and fifty-four wild boars, seven hundred and ninety-three yellow deer, one hundred and thirty-four large snakes, and two thousand seven hundred and seventy-six other wild animals.
    Huiyang County is mountainous. This year, the production teams and production brigades of various communes have organized a total of sixty-three hunting teams to go up the mountains to capture various wild animals, which not only protects crops, but also increases income and improves the lives of commune members.

    抓紧副业生产黄金季节
    因时制宜搞副业
    内蒙古自治区林西县新林镇人民公社在合理安排劳力的基础上，采取因时制宜的办法大搞冬季副业。最近，正是捕打山禽野兽和割羊胡子草的黄金季节，这个公社抓住了时机，及时组成一百一十四个专业队，一个月来已割草三十多万斤，并捕打了大批山禽野兽。
    认真解决具体问题
    湖北阳新县白沙公社显堍管理区第一生产队，切实解决冬季副业生产中的一些具体问题。例如生产队腾出办公室作为木工车间，积极设法从别的队借来风扇，让铁工、木匠迅速投入生产；全队有十一名会打猎的社员，但只有四支土枪可用，生产队就投资二百元买枪和弹药，保证十一名社员都能上山打猎。对搞冬季运输、打猎等劳动强度较大的社员，则在生活上给予适当的照顾。
    建立临时专业战线
    河北怀来县沙城公社沙城大队在不影响农业生产的原则下，全队共建立了二十五个副业临时专业队、厂、组，共占用总劳力的7％。
    这个队还根据不同的副业生产项目，采取了不同的劳动组织形式：猪、禽、蜂、兔采取集中饲养和分散饲养相结合；修、造、编、运采取固定安排和灵活调配相结合。运用这些组织形式后，既保证了农业生产必需的劳力，又促进了副业生产的发展。
    划分经营范围
    河南舞阳县吴城公社汪庄大队，坚持集体副业和家庭副业同时并举的生产方针，划分了大队、小队和社员个人的经营范围：凡规模较大、技术性较强的副业（如铁工、木工、缝纫、轧花等）归大队统一经营；投资较小，资金周转较快的副业（如短途运输、打猎等）归小队经营；零星副业（如饲养家禽、刨药、家庭小手工业等）由社员自行经营，收入归各人所有。
    确定合理的报酬
    吉林安图县长兴公社各管理区在狩猎副业生产中，针对狩猎费衣服、费鞋、劳动条件艰苦等具体情况，合理地确定了劳动报酬。吾峰一管理区还按狩猎小组每个成员的技术高低，猎获物价值的多少，从小组总收入中提取3％作为对技术高，猎获物多的老猎手的奖励，使新、老猎手更加团结，互相学习，取长补短，大大地推动了狩猎副业生产。
    惠阳打猎初战告捷
    广东省惠阳县冬季打猎据初步统计，已猎获老虎七只、豹一只、黑熊三只、山猪二百五十四只、黄麖七百九十三只，大蛇一百三十四条，以及其他野兽二千七百七十六只。
    惠阳县多山，今年各公社的生产队和生产小队共组织了六十三个打猎队，上山捕打各种野兽，既保卫了农作物，又增加了收入，改善了社员生活。
