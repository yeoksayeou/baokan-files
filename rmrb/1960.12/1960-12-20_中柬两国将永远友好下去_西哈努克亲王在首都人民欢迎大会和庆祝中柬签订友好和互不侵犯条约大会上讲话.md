Xinhua News Agency, December 19th. His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Head of State of Cambodia, spoke at a rally held by people from all walks of life in the capital to welcome him and celebrate the signing of the Sino-Cambodian Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression:

Mr. Chairman, Mr. Prime Minister, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, dearest friends:

Please allow me to express my sincere gratitude to the excellent organizers of this gathering, which embodies the friendship that exists between our two countries. I also express my extremely warm thanks to Mr. Chairman of the Congress for his enthusiastic words about Cambodia and its people.

Today's grand gathering is like icing on the cake for the Treaty of Friendship just signed by the heads of our two governments on behalf of Cambodia and China. This treaty clearly stipulates that our two countries will forever be friendly and that both sides guarantee never to participate in aggressive organizations against the other.

This treaty declares to all countries that the friendly relations linking Cambodia and China are unbreakable, and anyone who wants to undermine this friendship will be wasting their time. Following the unforgettable visit of the Prime Minister of People's China to Cambodia and the visit of the Head of State of Cambodia to China, today's conference proves that this Treaty of Friendship reflects the sincere and warm feelings of our two peoples.

However, I think it is necessary to briefly describe the history of Sino-Cambodian friendship. As you all know, the friendly relations between Cambodia and China have a long history of at least one thousand five hundred years. However, let our historians study this history carefully. I only want to talk about the relationship that has existed between our two countries since our country regained its national independence in 1953.

During the 1954 Geneva Conference, independent Cambodia and the People's Republic of China had their first meeting. At the Bandung Conference in 1955, this friendly initial contact went a step further. I had the honor of meeting Premier Zhou Enlai there for the first time, and this meeting marked the birth of a great friendship.

In 1956, I led a national delegation on its first visit to China. The courage, vigor, pragmatism, and desire for peace and progress of the Chinese leaders and the Chinese people left an extremely deep impression on me and all my compatriots. A few months later, when Premier Zhou Enlai, the great architect of Sino-Cambodian friendship, paid an official visit to Cambodia, our country had already established friendship and trust in China.

Since 1956, our exchanges have become more frequent, thereby promoting further understanding and mutual respect between us. This respect, for us, later became great admiration because of the amazing achievements made by the Chinese people. Chinese Peking Opera troupes and sports teams have been very successful here, and our Royal Ballet troupe has also received an unforgettable warm welcome in your country.

Our understanding of New China has also been enriched by the initial results of its generous assistance to us in 1956 and the fraternal joint labor of Chinese and Khmer technicians.

From 1958 to 1960, due to the historic establishment of diplomatic relations between our two countries, due to new mutual state visits, due to China's consistent and unambiguous support for Cambodia when some of Cambodia's neighbors carried out armed incursions, occupations, and territorial claims against her, due to the completion and commissioning of the first batch of Chinese-aided factories in Cambodia, due to the start of operations of the huge radio station donated by China, due to the increasing number of trainees and students sent by Cambodia to China for further study, and due to the arrival in Cambodia of new Chinese technicians who contributed to our construction with their admirable dedication and trained young Cambodian cadres, because of all this, the friendship and cooperation between China and Cambodia has had a "great leap forward."

Of course, apart from our sincere admiration for China, our gratitude to her, and our support for the just cause advocated by China, our small Cambodia can contribute very little to the powerful New China. Cambodia, defying all threats, all blackmail, and all conspiracies, tenaciously, firmly, and confidently defended China's just cause on the international stage.

I should particularly express my gratitude to China for the effective support she gave us at the most critical moment of Cambodia's national survival. When we were faced with foreign threats, China has always, through the voices of her leaders, loudly and clearly demonstrated her determination to support Cambodia's independence and territorial integrity. This support from China, combined with our will to defend freedom and territorial integrity and oppose aggression, is of paramount importance to our country's future.

Now, allow me to talk about China's assistance to our country's construction. This assistance has two characteristics:

First, People's China provides direct assistance to Cambodia, specifically manifested in: building new factories (textile mills, plywood factories, paper mills, and cement factories to be built soon), donating a powerful radio station, and sending technicians to be responsible for surveying our country's underground resources. We express our deep gratitude for this major contribution to equipping our country and industrializing our country, because this contribution has direct and great benefits for our country and our people, and prepares the conditions for our country's complete economic independence.

Second, the example set by the Chinese people in the cause of building their own country is also a kind of assistance to us, that is to say, forging ahead bravely, persevering, uniting as one, and full of confidence. People's China has innovated some effective inherent methods, and our country has borrowed these methods and achieved satisfactory results. I mainly want to mention the participation of all civil servants, as well as members of parliament, soldiers, youth, villagers, and members of the government itself in voluntary labor to build huge projects, dams, roads, bridges, canals, etc. that benefit extensively. This voluntary labor has been implemented since January 1, 1959, and, generally speaking, has been very successful, because our people have long known the achievements that China has made in this area. In agriculture and handicrafts, we have borrowed and will continue to borrow Chinese methods and technologies. In this regard, I can give many, many more examples.

I believe that it is beneficial to give you a general introduction to the achievements that Cambodia has made in her efforts to engage in construction in recent years. Of course, compared with the achievements made by your country, our achievements are insignificant. But Cambodia and her five million people have made undeniable achievements since regaining national independence.

Since regaining national independence, we have been facing a dual task: restoring the national economy that has been severely damaged by the war and cultivating a new generation of young people who will take on historical tasks. Our national economy has been quickly restored and has developed rapidly. We are vigorously developing education.

As a result, in the past five years, our elementary schools have doubled, and the number of students has increased by 60%. In fact, illiteracy has been eliminated in our country. Secondary schools have increased tenfold, and the number of students has tripled. In higher education, we have established four colleges. The number of students in technical schools has increased 3.5 times, etc. We will continue this effort, especially in technical education. In addition, I should point out that the Soviet Union recently offered us assistance in establishing a higher technical school to train the talents most urgently needed in our country. We accepted this assistance with gratitude. In order to more clearly illustrate the scale of our efforts in education, I think it is necessary to point out that Cambodia's expenditure on this area accounts for 22.5% of the national budget, in other words, it exceeds the defense budget.

In terms of public health, we have also achieved satisfactory results. We have established clinics, medical stations, and maternity hospitals in the most remote areas of our country. Now, the infant mortality rate has decreased significantly, and the miasma disease that used to spread in most areas of our country is disappearing. Every year, the state greatly increases the funds used for public health; in the past four years, this expenditure has tripled.

We have now started our first five-year plan. This five-year plan first focuses on developing agricultural and industrial production.

In developing agricultural production, we have begun to improve traditional farming methods, such as rice, corn, sesame, etc., using the effective methods adopted by China in the early days of liberation. We believe that your policy, briefly known as "walking on two legs," that is, adopting a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, can be fully applied in our country. We have also started plans to develop typical tropical crops such as rubber, cotton, jute, and coffee. This plan is being implemented while we are going all out to develop agricultural water conservancy construction.

At the same time, we have also begun industrialization. In this regard, we are also "walking on two legs." On the one hand, we have increased small enterprises by 3.5 times. On the other hand, we have established state-owned industries that should mainly be credited to China's assistance. Our country's industrialization is aimed at processing our country's raw materials, agricultural products, or forest products. We are now considering mainly relying on the technical assistance of Czechoslovakia to build a tire factory, a sugar factory, a small tractor assembly plant, a burlap bag factory, etc. to process our country's raw materials.

In addition, our plan also stipulates that priority should be given to increasing electricity production and expanding electricity transmission. Therefore, we have formulated a large-scale plan to build hydroelectric power stations. This plan will be realized with the technical assistance of the Soviet Union.

We believe that if we complete our first five-year plan, we will be able to take a big step forward on the road to getting rid of our current underdeveloped state.

Now, I should briefly explain to you Cambodia's position on some major international issues that are of concern to all mankind, especially Asian countries and peoples.

Cambodia is neutral. She firmly believes that the path of peaceful coexistence is in the interests of all countries and peoples. She endorses the resolutions of the Bandung Conference, and despite the threats, unreasonable demands, and attacks of certain countries and governments against her, she has consistently respected the letter and spirit of these resolutions.

We believe that the issue of disarmament is a major issue that deserves our attention. In this regard, we have stated that we believe that Chairman Khrushchev's new proposal for complete and thorough disarmament is a constructive proposal that should be agreed upon. However, whether it is a conference to discuss complete and thorough disarmament or a conference of major world powers seeking to resolve major issues, we believe that the participation of the People's Republic of China is absolutely necessary. This is just as it is necessary for the People's Republic of China to immediately obtain its legitimate status in the United Nations, because only the representatives of the People's Republic of China are the true and legitimate representatives of the Chinese people.

In addition, there is another issue that is of direct concern to us, because this issue threatens the stability and peace of Southeast Asia. I am referring to the serious events currently developing in Laos. This unfortunate country is our neighbor and also China's neighbor. We have many traditional ties with her. In this country, a man-made civil war has the danger of unlimited expansion. We believe that, for the benefit of the Lao people and for the benefit of the whole world, it is imperative to seek ways to extinguish this war.

A few months ago, I suggested to the major powers that they recognize and guarantee the neutrality of Laos and end all foreign interference. Today, it seems that this is the only solution that can bring peace to the Kingdom of Laos and the Lao people, but direct foreign intervention has dashed all hopes. The whole world, especially the major powers that participated in the Geneva Conference, is faced with an urgent problem that needs to be solved and cannot be avoided. It is hoped that these countries will realize this. Now, it is not too late.

From our side, recent events have made us believe that it is appropriate to convene a conference attended by major countries and countries that are responsible for and concerned about the situation in Laos to seek a solution to the turbulent situation in Laos. It is extremely unjust for the innocent, kind, and peaceful Lao people to pay a tragic price for the separatism and ambitions of certain foreign governments or foreign groups.

Only a conference like the 1954 Geneva Conference can make it possible for Laos to regain peace and for the Lao people to enjoy the right to choose policies and governments that are in their own interests. We ask China, the Soviet Union, the United States, India, Thailand, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Republic of Vietnam to consider with us and our Lao brothers holding such a conference aimed at saving Laos and Southeast Asia and world peace.

As for many other issues, including the issue of finally eliminating colonialism, Cambodia's position and China's position are not fundamentally different, because their positions are based on the principle of the people's right to freedom and progress.

Finally, we hope that China will be able to recover as soon as possible that part of its territory that is still being unreasonably placed outside its legitimate sovereignty.

However, before concluding, I would like to once again express my heartfelt thanks to the great Chinese people, their representatives, and their outstanding leaders for the grand welcome and warm reception they have given us. This welcome and reception makes us feel that, for you, we are not foreigners, but relatives who belong to the same family as you. We are also very grateful to China, because, although she is one of the most powerful countries in the world, she has not adopted a chauvinistic attitude towards our country. For some large countries, medium-sized countries, and even some small countries, they actually cannot do this. However, we are convinced that only when all large and small countries, rich and poor countries, respect each other and treat each other equally can the people of all countries come closer to each other and serve the cause of peace.

We have unlimited admiration for China's great achievements in all aspects, and we also express our heartfelt respect for China's altruism. The goal that China has set for itself is: to catch up with and surpass the powerful countries that had already industrialized more than 100 years before the victory of the Chinese revolution, to benefit the people; at the same time, China generously assists small countries in Asia and Africa. The breadth of this assistance from China fully demonstrates the praiseworthy brotherhood that unites China with countries and peoples struggling to get rid of colonialism, safeguard territorial integrity, develop and consolidate independence, and get rid of economic backwardness. This also shows that China is able to shoulder all the responsibilities that it bears as a major world power and a member of the complete and indivisible human family. Therefore, we are pleased to express this heartfelt respect to China on behalf of our people and our government.

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the Chinese people!

Glory to the friendship between our two peoples!

    中柬两国将永远友好下去
    西哈努克亲王在首都人民欢迎大会和庆祝中柬签订友好和互不侵犯条约大会上讲话
    新华社19日讯　柬埔寨国家元首诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王殿下在首都各界人民为欢迎他和庆祝中柬友好和互不侵犯条约签订大会上的讲话主席先生，总理先生，阁下们，女士们，先生们，最亲爱的朋友们：
    请允许我向这次集会的出色的组织者表示深切的谢意，这一令人感动的集会体现出存在于我们两国之间的友谊。我并向大会主席先生对柬埔寨和我国人民所说的热情洋溢的话表示极其热烈的感谢。
    今天这次盛大的集会对我们两国政府首脑刚才代表柬埔寨和中国所签订的友好条约来说，好比锦上添花。这一条约明确规定，我们两国将永远友好下去，双方并保证决不参加针对另一方的侵略性的组织。
    这一条约向各国宣告，把柬埔寨和中国联结在一起的友好关系是牢不可破的，谁想破坏这种友谊那是枉费心机的。继人民中国总理阁下在柬埔寨进行了令人难忘的访问之后和柬埔寨国家元首访问中国之际，今天这次大会证明，这一友好条约反映了我们两国人民真挚热忱的情谊。
    但是，我想，简略地叙述一下中柬友好的历史是必要的。你们都知道，柬埔寨和中国之间的友好关系至少已经有一千五百年的悠久历史，然而，这段历史还是让我们的历史学家们去仔细研究吧，我只想谈谈自从1953年我国重新取得民族独立以来存在于我们两国之间的关系。
    在1954年日内瓦会议期间独立的柬埔寨和中华人民共和国进行了第一次会见。在1955年万隆会议上，这种友好的初步接触又进了一步。我荣幸地在那里第一次会见了周恩来总理先生，这次会见标志了伟大友谊的诞生。
    1956年，我率领一个国家代表团对中国进行了第一次访问。中国领导人和中国人民的勇敢、朝气、现实精神以及要求和平与进步的意志给了我和我所有的同胞极其深刻的印象。几个月以后，当中柬友谊的伟大缔造者周恩来总理到柬埔寨进行正式访问的时候，我们的国家已经树立了对中国的友谊和信任。
    从1956年起，我们的往来频繁起来，从而促进了我们之间的进一步了解和相互尊重。这种尊重，对我们来说，由于中国人民所取得的惊人成就后来就成为极大的钦佩。中国的京剧团和体育队在我们这里获得很大的成功，而我们的皇家芭蕾舞团在你们的国家也受到了难以忘怀的热烈欢迎。
    我们对新中国的认识还由于它在1956年曾对我们慷慨的援助所获得的初步成果以及中国和高棉技术人员兄弟般的共同劳动而更加充实。
    从1958到1960年，由于我们两国外交关系的历史性的建立，由于新的相互间的国事访问，由于中国在柬埔寨的某些邻国对她进行武装侵扰、侵占以及提出领土要求时给予柬埔寨的一贯而毫不含混的支持，由于中国援助柬埔寨的第一批工厂的建成和投入生产，由于中国赠送的巨大的广播电台的开始工作，由于柬埔寨派往中国进行深造的实习生和学生的日益增多，以及由于以其令人钦佩的忠于职守的精神，对我国建设作出贡献并造就高棉年青干部的新的中国技术人员的来到柬埔寨，由于这一切，中柬两国的友谊和合作有了一个“大跃进”。
    诚然，除了我们对中国表示真诚的钦佩，对她表示感激，以及对中国所主张的正当事业给予支持以外，我们小小的柬埔寨对强大的新中国是很少能够有什么贡献的。柬埔寨蔑视一切威胁，一切讹诈，一切阴谋，在国际舞台上顽强地、坚定地和满怀信心地为中国的正当事业进行着辩论。
    我特别应该对中国表示感激，感谢她在我们柬埔寨在民族生存最危急的时刻所给予的有效的支持。当我们面临着外来威胁的时候，中国一贯通过她的领导人的呼声，响亮地和明确地表明她对支持柬埔寨独立和领土完整的决心。中国的这一支持和我们维护自由与领土完整及反对侵略的意志结合在一起，对我国的未来具有头等重要的意义。
    现在，请允许我谈谈中国对我国建设的援助。这种援助具有两个特点：
    第一，人民中国向柬埔寨提供直接援助，具体表现为：建设新的工厂（纺织厂、胶合板厂、造纸厂以及即将兴建的水泥厂），赠送一座功率强大的广播电台，派遣技术人员负责勘察我国地下资源。对这种为装备我国和使我国工业化所作出的重大贡献，我们表示万分感谢，因为这种贡献对我国和我国人民有着直接的巨大的利益，并且为我国经济上的完全独立准备条件。
    第二，中国人民在建设自己国家的事业中所树立的榜样，也是对我们的一种援助，这就是说，勇往直前，坚韧不拔，团结一致，信心十足。人民中国对某些行之有效的固有的办法进行了革新，我国借用了这些办法，并且获得了圆满的结果。我主要想提一提全部公务人员以及议员、军人、青年、村民、政府成员本身参加义务劳动，兴建广泛受益的巨大工程、堤坝、公路、桥梁、河渠等等。这种义务劳动是从1959年1月1日开始实行的，而且，总的说来，是很成功的，因为我国人民早就知道中国在这方面已经取得的成就。在农业和手工业方面，我们曾经借用过，并且还要继续借用中国的方法和技术，在这方面，我还可以举出很多很多的例子。
    我相信现在向你们概括地介绍一下近年来柬埔寨在她努力从事的建设中所取得的成就是有益的。当然，同贵国所获得的成就比较，我们的成就是微不足道的。但是柬埔寨和她的五百万人民自从恢复了民族独立以来，已经取得了无可置辩的成就。
    自从恢复了民族独立以来，我们一直面临着双重的任务：恢复受到战争严重破坏的国民经济和培养担负起历史任务的青年一代。我国的国民经济很快地得到恢复，而且有了迅速的发展。我们大力地发展着教育事业。
    因而在过去的五年中，我们的小学校增长了一倍，学生人数增加了60％。实际上，在我国文盲已经被扫除。中等学校增长了十倍，学生人数增加了三倍。在高等教育方面，我们创办了四所学院。技术学校的学生人数已经增加了三点五倍，等等。我们将继续这一努力，特别是在技术教育方面。此外，我应该指出，不久前苏联向我们提出了关于帮助我们建立一个培养我国最迫切需要的人材的高等技术学校的援助。我们怀着感激的心情接受了这一援助。为了更清楚地说明我们在教育事业方面所作的努力的规模，我认为有必要指出，柬埔寨用于这一个方面的经费占国家预算的22.5％，换句话说，即超过了国防的预算。
    在公共卫生方面，我们也获得了令人满意的结果。在我国最偏僻的地区，我们已经设立了医务所，医疗站和妇产医院。现在，婴儿的死亡率已经显著地下降，以往在我国大部分地区蔓延的瘴气病正在消失。每年，国家大量增加用于公共卫生事业的经费；在过去的四年中，这一项经费增加了三倍。
    目前我们已经开始了第一个五年计划。这个五年计划首先着重发展农业和工业生产。
    在发展农业生产方面，我们已经采用中国在解放初期行之有效的方法，开始改进传统的耕种方法，例如稻、玉蜀黍、芝麻等等。我们相信你们的简称为“两条腿走路”的方针，也就是说采用土洋结合的办法完全可以在我们国内运用。我们也已经开始了发展例如橡胶、棉花、黄麻、咖啡等典型热带作物的计划。这一计划是在我们全力以赴发展农业水利建设的同时执行的。
    同时，我们也已经开始了工业化。在这方面，我们也是“两条腿走路”，一方面我们把小型企业增加了三点五倍，另一方面，我们建立了主要应该归功于中国的援助的国营工业。我国的工业化是为了对我国的原料，农产品或林产品进行加工。现在我们考虑主要依靠捷克斯洛伐克的技术援助，建立一个处理我国原料的轮胎工厂，一个制糖厂，一个小型拖拉机装配厂，一个麻袋厂，等等。
    此外，我们的计划还规定优先提高电力的产量和扩大电力的输送量。因而我们制定了一项大规模兴建水电站的计划。该项计划将在苏联的技术援助下实现。
    我们相信，如果我们完成第一个五年计划，我们将能够在摆脱目前不发达状态的道路上向前迈出很大的一步。
    现在，我应当向你们简要地说明柬埔寨对整个人类特别是亚洲国家和人民所关心的某些重大国际问题的立场。
    柬埔寨是中立的。她坚决相信，和平共处的道路是符合所有国家和人民的利益的。她赞同万隆会议的各项决议，并且尽管某些国家和政府对她的威胁、无理要求和攻击，她依然一贯尊重这些决议的文字和精神。
    我们相信，裁军问题是值得我们关注的重大问题。在这方面，我们已经声明过，我们认为赫鲁晓夫主席关于全面彻底裁军的新建议是应当就之达成协议的建设性的建议。但是，不论是讨论全面彻底裁军的会议或是寻求解决重大问题的世界大国会议，我们都认为中华人民共和国的参加是绝对必要的。这正如必须立即由中华人民共和国立刻取得她在联合国的合法地位一样，因为只有中华人民共和国的代表才是中国人民的真正和合法的代表。
    另外，还有一个问题也是我们直接关心的，因为这个问题威胁着东南亚的稳定与和平。我指的是目前在老挝发展着的严重事件。这个不幸的国家是我们的邻国，也是中国的邻国。我们和她有着多方面的传统联系。在这个国家里，人为挑起的内战有着无限扩大的危险。我们认为，为了老挝人民的利益，为了全世界的利益，必须刻不容缓地寻求扑灭这场战火的办法。
    几个月以前，我曾经向各大国建议，承认和保证老挝的中立，并终止一切外来干涉。今天看来，这是唯一能够使老挝王国和老挝人民获得和平的解决办法，但是外来的直接干涉却使一切希望烟消云散。全世界，特别是参加日内瓦会议的各大国，面临着一个迫切需要解决的，无法回避的问题。但愿这些国家了解到这一点，现在，还为时未晚。
    从我们这方面来说，最近的一些事件使我们认为召开一次由负有责任和关心老挝局势的大国和国家参加的、寻求解决老挝纷乱局面的会议是适宜的。要无辜、善良与和平的老挝人民对某些外国政府或外国某些集团的分裂主义和野心付出悲惨的代价是十分不公正的。
    只有像1954年日内瓦会议那样的会议才能使老挝有可能重新获得和平，才能使老挝人民享有选择符合自己利益的政策和政府的权利。我们要求中国、苏联、美国、印度、泰国、越南民主共和国以及越南共和国同我们和我们的老挝兄弟一起考虑举行这样一次旨在拯救老挝以及东南亚和世界和平的会议。
    至于对其他许多问题，其中包括最后消灭殖民主义的问题，柬埔寨的立场和中国的立场是没有基本上的分歧的，因为她们的立场都是以人民对自由和进步的权利的原则为基础的。
    最后，我们愿中国能够早日收复仍然被横蛮无理地置于她的合法主权以外的那部分领土。
    但是，在结束以前，我还要再一次向伟大的中国人民、他们的代表和他们杰出的领导者表示衷心的谢意，感谢他们所给与我们的盛大欢迎和热情接待。这种欢迎和接待使我们感到，对你们来说，我们并不是外国人，而是和你们属于同一家族的亲戚一样。我们还十分感激中国，因为，尽管她是世界最强大的国家之一，但是她对我国却没有采取沙文主义的态度。对某些大国、中等国家，以至某些小国来说，他们实际上做不到这一点，然而，我们确信，只有一切大国和小国、富国和穷国彼此之间相互尊重和平等对待，才能使各国人民互相接近，并为和平事业服务。
    我们对中国在各方面所取得的巨大成就无限钦佩，同时也对中国的利他主义表示衷心的敬意。中国给自己确定的目标是：赶上和超过在中国革命胜利前一百多年就已经工业化了的强国，为人民造福；与此同时，中国还慷慨地援助亚洲和非洲的小国。中国这种援助的广泛性充分说明了把中国和为摆脱殖民主义，维护领土完整，发展和巩固独立，和摆脱经济上不发达状态而斗争的国家和人民联结在一起的为人称颂的兄弟情谊。这也说明了中国能够负起作为世界大国和完整而不可分的人类大家庭的一员所承担的全部责任。因此，我们高兴地代表我国人民和我国政府，向中国表示这种衷心的敬意。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国人民万岁！
    光荣归于我们两国人民之间的友谊！
