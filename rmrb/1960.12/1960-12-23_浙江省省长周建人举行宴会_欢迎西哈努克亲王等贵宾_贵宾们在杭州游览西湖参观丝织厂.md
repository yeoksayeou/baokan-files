He spoke of the long-standing traditional friendship between the peoples of China and Cambodia. He said, "This time, His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk signed the Sino-Cambodian Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression in our country, bringing the friendship between the peoples of China and Cambodia and the friendly cooperative relations between the two countries into a new stage. The equal, mutually beneficial, and friendly cooperative relations between China and Cambodia have in fact become a good example of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems."

Zhou Jianren said, "When the peoples of our two countries are committed to building our own countries, and striving to eradicate the poverty and backwardness caused by imperialism and colonialism, and when imperialism is using all means to sow discord and create division among Asian countries, it requires us to unite and cooperate more closely than ever before, hold high the banner of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit, and advance side by side."

Prince Sihanouk spoke to warm applause, expressing his gratitude for the warm welcome from the people of Hangzhou and the warm hospitality of the Governor. Prince Sihanouk said that they came to Hangzhou, known for its beauty and harmony, with great pleasure, where the beautiful scenery is used to benefit the people, and the unique historical sites have been repaired, all of which proves that New China has become a modern industrial power, while still maintaining and developing her world-renowned art.

Prince Sihanouk said, "Our visit to your beautiful and great country marks a new stage in the development of our friendship and cooperation. Three days ago, we were pleased to sign a treaty of friendship, which specifically fixed the ties that permanently unite Cambodia and China."

Prince Sihanouk said, "We are now more firmly convinced that our solidarity in the struggle to defend our common ideals is a factor that brings new hope to the future of our two countries and the maintenance of peace in Asia."

He continued, "This unity, expressed in such a moving way, is a unity as close as family, because there is no conflict of interest or conflict in our family, but on the contrary, we are always concerned with supporting and helping each other."

Prince Sihanouk said that the achievements of China's Great Leap Forward had left a deep impression on them. He said, "Thanks to the socialist regime and the courage, drive, and confidence of the Chinese people, China is now growing at an extraordinary rate, and it has been and should be admired by all truly objective countries in the world."

Prince Sihanouk said that Cambodian-Chinese cooperation had yielded fruitful results and would yield more beautiful and fruitful results in the future. To this end, he expressed his sincere respect to Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi for personally promoting the harmonious development of this cooperation.

Prince Sihanouk finally suggested that in the name of friendship, for the health of Chairman Mao Zedong, the respected founder of the People's Republic of China, for the health of the respected Chairman Liu Shaoqi, for the happiness and prosperity of the people of Hangzhou, and for the unbreakable fraternal friendship between Cambodia and China, let us raise our glasses.
