    Tit-for-Tat, Every Inch Must Be Contested
    —Recollections of the Struggle to Counter Enemy Seizure of Strategic Points Before and After the 1946 Ceasefire Order Took Effect
  　Lieutenant General  Chen Zhengxiang
    The Spring of 1946 brought news of peace to the people of the whole country. The army and people of the liberated areas, after four months of self-defense war, had crushed the Kuomintang army’s offensives in Suiyuan, Shangdang, and along the Pinghan Railway lines. The Kuomintang, compelled by the failure of the civil war and the inadequate preparation for a large-scale war, was outwardly forced to accept our Party’s proposal for convening a Political Consultative Conference and achieving a ceasefire, under the pressure of domestic and international forces for peace and democracy. U.S. imperialism also hypocritically sent Marshall as a special envoy, feigning a “fair” face, to “mediate” in the Chinese civil war, but in reality, to create favorable conditions for Chiang Kai-shek's strategic offensive. On January 10, 1946, the Chiang-CCP sides signed a ceasefire agreement and issued an order to cease the civil war, which was stipulated to take effect at 24:00 on January 13. This was a defeat for the Kuomintang's consistent adherence to a dictatorial and civil war policy and a victory for our Party's leadership of the people of the whole country in the struggle for peace and democracy.
    Contrary to the people's desire for peace, the Kuomintang reactionaries had no sincerity at all. While Chiang Kai-shek signed the ceasefire agreement with us, he was also deploying for civil war, secretly ordering his troops to seize strategic points by surprise before the ceasefire order took effect on January 13. Our Party was highly vigilant about this criminal conspiracy of the Kuomintang. In the telegram from the military region forwarded by the Central Military Commission a few days before the issuance of the ceasefire order, it was pointed out: “The Kuomintang may launch a sudden attack on us before the ceasefire. It is hoped that all units will heighten their vigilance and firmly defend their positions. The attacking enemy must be resolutely and thoroughly annihilated.” At that time, our Jinchaji Military Region, Ji-Jin Column, was stationed in Yanggao in northern Shanxi and Fengzhen in eastern Suiyuan, with the task of: coordinating with fraternal units to prevent the Kuomintang army in Suiyuan and Datong from attacking us, and ensuring the safety of the western line of Zhangjiakou.
    On the morning of January 13, the sun was shining brightly. In Yanggao city, where my column was stationed, gongs and drums were beating and songs were flying. People flocked to the streets with joy, in a festive atmosphere. At this time, several leading comrades of our column and the political commissars of each brigade were holding a meeting at the headquarters to discuss studying the instructions of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao on the current situation, and to study whether the enemy would abide by the ceasefire order and how to maintain the ceasefire agreement. How could we, who had been fighting for the revolution for so long, not seriously discuss such an important issue? However, just a dozen hours before the ceasefire order was to take effect, reports of enemy attacks on us came one after another.
    On the phone, Comrade Chen Fangren, commander of the Fourth Brigade, told us in an indignant tone: A division of the enemy's vanguard forces in Datong is attacking the position of the first battalion of our 47th Regiment at Yujiashan by separate routes, and the enemy has clamored to take Yanggao. Immediately, we ordered: the garrison of Yujiashan to resolutely resist the enemy, and the main force of the 47th Regiment stationed in Julebao to quickly reinforce Yujiashan; and ordered Comrade Chen Fangren to immediately lead the main force of the brigade from its station in Jinjiazhuang, Qiaotoubao and other places to Yujiashan to annihilate the invading enemy.
    Before one wave subsided, another rose. As soon as I put down the phone, the telegraph operator sent an urgent telegram from Comrade Ma Long, commander of the Third Brigade. The telegram said: A group of enemies from Datong attacked the second battalion of our 12th Regiment stationed in Gushan on the evening of the 12th. The 10th Regiment of the Third Brigade stationed in Fengzhen went to reinforce it; however, the entire puppet Mongol army of Wang Ying and a division of Ma Zhanshan bypassed Gushan via Zhenchuanbao last night and raided Fengzhen in secret, taking advantage of the gap to break into the city at dawn today. Our brigade headquarters has been surrounded by the enemy and is resisting stubbornly. Please send reinforcements from the column quickly.
    Subsequently, we learned from situation reports from the military region and fraternal units in Jin-Sui that the 14th Division of the 5th Provincial Defense Army of the enemy Han Buzhou in Datong had crossed the Sanggan River secretly last night and was advancing towards Hunyuan. At the same time, the 13th Division of the enemy invaded Zuoyun. A unit of Kuomintang cavalry in Gui-Sui invaded Helin and Taolin, with the intention of continuing to invade Jining; on the eastern front, the Kuomintang army was advancing towards Pingquan and Gubeikou by separate routes, attempting to occupy our Chengde.
    Faced with such a serious enemy situation, we stood in front of the map and studied the situation. The new situation more clearly answered the central topic of our meeting. As expected by the Central Military Commission, the enemy's "peace" mask was once again exposed by the facts. We clearly saw that the enemy in Datong, under the command of Chu Xichun, was attacking in full force by separate routes, attempting to take strategic points quickly before the ceasefire order took effect. This was part of a new conspiracy directed by Chiang Kai-shek to undermine peace throughout the country. The enemies in Datong and Gui-Sui attempted to connect the western section of the Ping-Sui Railway and the northern section of the Tong-Pu Railway, dividing the connection between our Jin-Chaji and the Jin-Sui and Shan-Gan-Ning border regions; the enemies on the eastern front attempted to cut off our Rehe corridor and sever the connection between our region and the Northeast, so as to further encircle our Zhangjiakou from the east and west, preparing for a larger-scale civil war. The facts eloquently proved Chairman Mao's thesis: "Peace will not come unless the reactionaries who dare to attack the liberated areas are given a great blow." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume IV, p. 1158) According to Chairman Mao's policy of "tit-for-tat, every inch must be contested" and the military region's predetermined deployment, we decided to first annihilate the enemy in the central sector. We would use the main force of the Fourth Brigade to counterattack the enemy attacking Yujiashan and, after crushing the enemy's offensive, support Hunyuan to the south. We decided that Comrade Fu Chongbi, political commissar of the Third Brigade, would immediately lead the 11th Regiment of the Third Brigade stationed in the Yanggao area to return to Fengzhen quickly and relieve the siege of the Third Brigade headquarters. We reported our agreed tactics and determination to the leaders of the military region on the phone, and immediately received the approval of Commander Nie Rongzhen, who also transferred the 13th Brigade of the Ji-Zhong Column from Huailai to the Yanggao area on the morning of the 14th to reinforce us.
    The task was serious, and time was pressing. The Political Department of the Column called on all comrades in the army to disregard all fatigue, carry forward the spirit of continuous combat, fear no sacrifice, give up no inch of land, seize every second, and resolutely repel the enemy's perfidious offensive. When the cadres and soldiers heard that the enemy was launching a large-scale offensive against us, everyone was filled with righteous indignation and eager to fight. Less than half an hour after the column's counterattack order was issued, the various units set off from their stations one after another. Anger stirred the heart of every soldier. Although no one gave the order to run, the troops were running, heading for Yujiashan, for Fengzhen, for the place where the enemy was firing!
    Yujiashan is more than thirty miles northeast of Datong. The mountain is not very high, but it stands on the north side of the railway, controlling the railway and highway leading to Julebao and Yanggao. The first battalion of our 47th Regiment held the favorable terrain of Yujiashan, striking the swarming enemy. The enemy was the 4th Cavalry Division of Yan Xishan (without horses), which set off from Datong on the evening of the 12th and arrived under Yujiashan before dawn on the 13th. Before the departure, the enemy division commander, Tian Shangzhi, said to his subordinates: "Three hundred yuan will be rewarded for killing a Eighth Route Army soldier, five hundred yuan for capturing one alive, three thousand yuan for confiscating a rifle, ten thousand yuan for confiscating a machine gun..." and threatened: "No officer is allowed to issue a retreat order!" Tian Shangzhi also announced that this offensive would be coordinated by Japanese tanks, and that they must take Yujiashan, capture Julebao, and attack Yanggao. Our soldiers understood that they were on the front line of defending peace, and that the entire liberated area and the people of the whole country were watching us. Therefore, the fighting was exceptionally heroic. The soldiers' slogan was: "Defend Yujiashan, defend the people of the liberated area, and defend peace!" In order to save bullets, they proposed not to fire until the enemy was within range, to throw grenades at the enemy when they got close, and to smash the enemy with stones when the grenades ran out. In front of our army's position, the enemy's corpses were lying in disarray, and the enemy was never able to attack. From morning to noon, Yujiashan was still under the strong control of our army. After the enemy's frontal attack was frustrated, part of the enemy detoured to our Silipu; the main force of the enemy, under the cover of tanks driven by Japanese, attacked Xiwazi, on the flank and rear of our position. Our 47th Regiment immediately used the third battalion to block at Silipu, the second battalion to intercept the detouring enemy at Nanzhuang, and the first battalion to seize the enemy from the front of Yujiashan, breaking the enemy's plan to attack.
    At this time, the 6th Regiment of our Fourth Brigade ran from Wangguantun area. This unit had a background of old Red Army, was tested in battle, and could attack and defend. They immediately launched a fierce counterattack against the enemy from both sides of our army's position in Yujiashan. The enemy's detouring troops turned around and faced our 6th Regiment's troops. At 4 p.m., the 35th Regiment of our Fourth Brigade also arrived from Qiaotoubao area, tens of miles away. This was a fierce, rushing, flexible and mobile unit, and immediately launched an attack on the enemy's side and rear in the direction of Datong. Our 47th Regiment had already pressed down from the front, surrounding the enemy from three sides. The enemy's 4th Cavalry Division could not withstand our army's weight and immediately collapsed across the board, fleeing westward. Our troops pursued the enemy fiercely, launching a competition to seize guns and capture prisoners. The enemy fled quickly, and our army chased closely. The people near Yujiashan and Julebao, who were originally prepared to celebrate the ceasefire with our army, were very angry when they saw the Kuomintang army attacking us. During the battle, they actively reported the enemy's situation to our army and transported ammunition. Women and children comforted the wounded, delivered food and water, and at this time, they also pursued the fleeing enemy with our army. On the railway, highway and fields from Yujiashan to Datong, there was a shout of "Disarm and don't kill! Treat prisoners leniently!" The enemy fled like stray dogs. Our soldiers and the people pursued the enemy all the way to the city of Datong, killing, wounding and capturing more than 1,000 enemies, seizing hundreds of rifles, more than 20 light and heavy machine guns, and a part of military supplies. We liberated more than ten villages and towns, such as Zhousizhuang and Beijiazao, Ershilipu. The enemy division commander, Tian Shangzhi, and five or six hundred enemies in disarray took advantage of the darkness and fled back to Datong.
    At the same time as the battle of Yujiashan, the 11th Regiment of our Third Brigade, led by Brigade Political Commissar Fu Chongbi, rushed to Fengzhen day and night. At this time, the situation of our Third Brigade's directly subordinate unit (only carrying a guard company) surrounded by the enemy was very critical. Under the calm command of Brigade Commander Ma Long, they repelled the enemy's many attacks in one day on the 13th, and finally held a courtyard. The telephone line from Fengzhen to the outside world was cut off. In order to cope with any eventuality, the office cadres burned all the confidential documents on the evening of the 13th, preparing to fight the enemy to the end. On the morning of the 14th, the enemy did not attack. Gunshots came from the northeast direction of the city, and everyone turned from worry to joy. Brigade Commander Ma Long immediately ordered the bugler to blow the horn to transfer the troops into the city, and the troops arrived in response. This was the 10th Regiment of our Third Brigade. They were ordered on the 13th to rush to Gushan to cooperate with the 12th Regiment to defeat the enemy in Gushan. Due to the interruption of the telephone, the 10th Regiment commander first led a battalion back when they heard gunshots in the direction of Fengzhen. On the morning of the 14th, near Yanling Pagoda in the northeast of Fengzhen, they heard the sound of our brigade headquarters mobilizing troops, and immediately attacked into the city and launched street battles with the enemy. At 4 p.m., the main force of our 11th Regiment and 10th Regiment had arrived and launched a pincer attack on the Wang Ying bandit troops of the puppet Mongol army and Ma Zhanshan's cavalry division who had sneaked into our Fengzhen and attempted to hold on. Under our fierce attack, the enemy's men and horses were turned upside down and became a mess, fleeing in a northwestern direction. The main force of our Third Brigade chased the enemy's cavalry to the Liangcheng area, more than fifty miles away, annihilating more than 200 enemies and seizing more than 100 war horses. More than 100 other enemies, thinking that Fengzhen had been seized, some went out to plunder and rape, some looked for a place to smoke opium, and some were drunk. When they heard that the main force of our army had arrived, they hid in the homes of the citizens and dared not come out, and were finally captured alive by us. By dusk on the 14th, the Fengzhen-Gushan line was restored to its position before January 13. The people of Fengzhen hung red flags in every house, celebrating the victory of our army's counterattack against the enemy.
    At this time, on the road from Datong to Hunyuan, the soldiers of the 35th Regiment and 47th Regiment of our Fourth Brigade were marching and rushing. No one spoke, only the sound of running. They had just finished the battle of Yujiashan and immediately went south. Their task was: to immediately rush to Hunyuan, cooperate with the troops of the Fifth Military Sub-district of Ji-Jin, and annihilate the 14th Division of the Chiang-Yan army that had seized our Hunyuan city on the evening of the 13th.
    Hunyuan city is located north of Yanmen Pass and southeast of Datong. It is a key area connecting Yanbei and the North Yue area, and also the richest place in Datongchuan. Most of the soldiers of our Fourth Brigade were soldiers from Yanbei, and most of the vast areas of Yanbei, including Hunyuan county, were liberated by them. When the soldiers heard that Hunyuan city had been seized by the enemy, they wished they could immediately fly to Hunyuan to annihilate the enemy. It took a day and a night to reach Hunyuan from northeast of Datong, a distance of about 180 miles. Our 35th Regiment also fought a battle in Jijiazhuang on the way, intercepting all the logistics supplies of the enemy's 14th Division in Hunyuan. After our 35th Regiment and 47th Regiment arrived in Hunyuan on the evening of the 14th, they immediately launched an attack on the enemy. The main force of our 47th Regiment annihilated an enemy platoon in Qianmiao, east of the city. Under the fierce attack of our 47th Regiment, the enemy in Zhangjiazhuang was forced to withdraw to Hunyuan city before dawn on the 15th. Our 35th Regiment, attached to the second battalion of the 47th Regiment, immediately attacked Xiguan, annihilating most of an enemy battalion of the 41st Regiment, and pressing hard under the city of Hunyuan.
    On the 15th, the enemy who seized Hunyuan attempted to wait for the Executive Group to come for "mediation" with the established fact of the seizure. They mustered a superior force to launch three counterattacks against our 35th Regiment. The soldiers of the third battalion of our 35th Regiment engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy outside the West Gate, defeating the enemy's counterattack. At 4 p.m., the enemy in Yingxian came to reinforce, and was resolutely resisted by our 5th Sub-district troops near Shuimozhen. At 5 p.m., our Fourth Brigade attacked the city at the same time with the 35th Regiment and the third battalion of the 47th Regiment from the west to the east, and the main force of the 47th Regiment from the east to the west. Under the cover of artillery fire, the soldiers of the 35th Regiment climbed the city wall of the West Gate and used bayonet fighting to break through the enemy. Seeing that their reinforcements were hopeless, the remnants dared not fight and abandoned the city in the dark and fled in the direction of Datong. Our army chased all the way to the Sanggan River, capturing hundreds of enemies, seizing a mountain gun, and most of the rest scattered. A part of them were intercepted by our 39th Regiment, which rushed to reinforce Hunyuan, and were defeated. The remnants fled back to Datong. The city of Hunyuan, which was once seized by the Yan bandit army, returned to the arms of the people. At this point, our army completely crushed the conspiracy of the Datong Yan puppet army Chu Xichun to seize our Yanggao, Hunyuan, and Fengzhen areas.
    From the 13th, we lived in a tense war atmosphere. We constantly talked to the military region and various units on the telephone, and telegrams were also busy contacting the upper and lower levels. Several leaders of our column sat in the operations room day and night. On the 15th, when the news of our army's attack on Hunyuan city came, we had just relaxed a little, and immediately received a telegram from Commander Nie of the military region saying: "The Executive Group of the Military Mediation Department will fly to Jining to inspect before 12:00 on the 17th. It is hoped that you will quickly supervise the Third Brigade and the Sixth Regiment to cooperate with friendly forces, seize the time, spare no cost, resolutely and quickly annihilate the enemy invading Jining, and strive to end the battle before 10:00 on the 17th." Obviously, the arrival of the Executive Group at this time was a trick by the enemy to play "the thief shouting to catch the thief." Therefore, we must resolutely implement the instructions of the military region and recapture Jining from the enemy as soon as possible. Therefore, we immediately telegraphed the responsible comrades of the Third Brigade to implement. After the telegram was sent, we waited in the operations room, waiting for news. This night was so long! The northwest wind outside the window howled past. I thought: It's already the third nine days, and the soldiers' hands holding their guns in the windy area of Jining, which comes from the Mongolian plateau, are probably already frozen stiff! Thinking of this, we felt as if the cold wind outside the window was blowing on us. But we firmly believed in the soldiers' strong fighting will, and we firmly believed that the soldiers who grew up under the care of the Party and Chairman Mao would complete this arduous and glorious task, but time was too tight, how could we not worry and be anxious?
    As dawn approached, we had several phone calls with the Jining front line. Our army had attacked Jining fiercely three times, but still failed to break through. Both the enemy and us had suffered heavy casualties. According to Comrade Ma Long and Fu Chongbi, they had both personally observed under the city, looking for a breakthrough. They also said: The soldiers were in high spirits, and many people who were wounded still insisted on not leaving the front line. The cotton clothes of the soldiers who were not wounded were also torn by barbed wire and exposed cotton, but no one complained. They also conveyed the suggestion of Comrade Liu Zhili, battalion commander of the second battalion of the 11th Regiment, commander of the forward position: resolutely fight on, and resolutely recapture Jining from the enemy! What a heroic and touching spirit! This is a unanimous opinion from top to bottom: resolutely fight on, and we must recapture Jining!
    At 8 a.m. on the 17th, the final general attack began. All units moved at the same time from all directions. Our Third Brigade chose the section of the city wall with cracks in the northwest corner as the main attack direction. Four young communists in our 11th Regiment volunteered to blow up the wall. The brigade and regiment concentrated all light and heavy machine guns to block the firepower points on both sides of the cracks. Liu Zhili, battalion commander of the second battalion of the 11th Regiment, hung a heavy load and still directed the blasting team to carry out blasting outside the moat. The first soldier carried explosives and rushed up and was knocked down by the enemy. The second soldier followed and fell again, and the troops still could not get up. Everyone knew: There were only three or four hours left before the Executive Group arrived in Jining for inspection. The outcome of the battle was not only related to the success or failure of the entire anti-seizure of key points campaign, but also to the safety of Zhangjiakou and eastern Suiyuan. At the same time, if Jining could not be recaptured, the enemy's lies could not be exposed, and we would be in a passive position politically. At this time, Wei Zhanxiang, a communist member of the fourth company, jumped out of the moat and went straight to the city wall. It turned out that he had already carried dozens of pounds of explosives on his back. When he was about to approach the city wall, he suddenly fell down. People were shocked and worried about him. Who knew that he jumped up from the ground again and rushed all the way to the foot of the city wall. At this time, he was already wounded for the second time, and he still tried his best to stick his body to the crack in the city wall. Suddenly, there was a flash of fire and a loud "boom", and a large gap appeared in the city wall. Comrade Wei Zhanxiang, a communist member, opened the way for the assault troops with his precious life. Under the unified command of the leaders of the Jin-Sui fraternal units, our troops rushed into the city of Jining like a tide. By 11 o'clock, the battle was completely over. More than 2,000 enemies were captured alive and more than 1,000 war horses. A part of the remnant enemy cavalry jumped over the city and fled westward. At 12 o'clock, the battlefield was just cleaned up. A silver-white plane of the Executive Group of the Military Mediation Department landed in Jining. The US-Chiang representatives came at the request of the Kuomintang army. They thought they had arrived in Jining in a very timely manner so that they could protect the established fact that they had violated the agreement and occupied Jining, and tried to bite us back. Unfortunately, this double act was not well coordinated. At that time, they had to look at each other and were speechless, and had to confirm that Jining was under our army's control before the 13th.
    At the same time as the victory in Jining, the enemy who invaded our Gubeikou on the eastern front was also defeated by our army. The enemy's conspiracy to seize strategic points finally failed. We won a short period of peace. But more importantly, through this struggle, the vast number of commanders and fighters and the people were given a valuable lesson. Although at that time, the US imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries, talked loudly about "peace" and could also sign a "ceasefire agreement" with us, but as Chairman Mao pointed out: "Things on paper are not equal to real things" (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume IV, p. 1155), their reactionary essence will not change. To change things on paper into real things, we must strive with our struggle. (Attached picture)

    针锋相对，寸土必争
    ——记1946年停战令生效前后反敌抢夺战略要点的斗争
  　中将  陈正湘
    1946年的新春，给全国人民带来了和平的音讯。解放区军民，经过四个月的自卫战争，粉碎了国民党军在绥远、上党和平汉各线的进攻。国民党迫于内战失利，大打的准备又未搞好，在国内外和平民主力量的压力下，表面上不得不接受我党关于召开政治协商会议、实现和平停战的主张。美帝国主义也假惺惺地派遣马歇尔为特使，伪装“公正”的面孔，来“调处”中国内战，其实则为蒋介石的战略进攻创造有利条件。1946年1月10日，蒋我双方签订了停战协定，颁发了停止内战的命令，命令规定在1月13日二十四时生效。这是国民党一贯坚持独裁内战政策的失败，是我党领导全国人民为和平民主而斗争的胜利。
    和人民热爱和平的意愿相反，国民党反动派根本就没有诚意。蒋介石一只手和我们签订停战协定，另一只手却在部署内战，密令他的部队在1月13日停战令生效以前，乘我不备，抢夺战略要点。对于国民党这一罪恶阴谋，我党是高度警惕的。在停战令颁发前几天，从军区转来的中央军委的电报中，就曾经指出：“国民党在停战前可能向我作突然袭击，望各部提高警惕坚守阵地，对于来攻的敌人，须坚决彻底消灭之。”当时，我们晋察冀军区冀晋纵队驻防在晋北阳高和绥东丰镇一带，任务是：协同兄弟部队防止绥远和大同的国民党军对我们的进攻，确保张家口西线的安全。
    1月13日早上，阳光灿烂，我纵队驻地阳高城内锣鼓喧天，歌声飘扬，人们都喜气洋溢地拥到街上来，像过年过节一样一片欢乐景象。这时候，我们纵队的几个负责同志和各旅的政治委员，正在司令部开会，讨论学习中央和毛主席关于时局的指示，研究敌人会不会遵守停战令和如何维护停战协定的问题。我们这些长时期以来为革命而战斗的人们，对于这样重大的问题，怎么能够不认真地加以讨论呢？可是，就在这距停战令生效只有十几个小时的时候，接二连三地传来了敌人向我进攻的报告。
    电话里，第四旅旅长陈仿仁同志以激愤的语调告诉我们：大同敌人先头部队一个师，正分途向我遇驾山第四十七团一营的阵地进攻，敌人扬言要拿下阳高。当下，我们命令：遇驾山守军坚决抗击敌人，驻守聚乐堡的第四十七团主力，速往遇驾山增援；并令陈仿仁同志立即率旅的主力由驻地金家庄、桥头堡等地出发，赶往遇驾山歼灭进犯的敌人。
    一波未平，一波又起。当我刚把电话筒放下，译电员送来了第三旅旅长马龙同志的告急电报。电报中说：大同的敌人一股，12日晚进袭我驻孤山之第十二团二营，我丰镇驻军第三旅的第十团前往增援；而大同的伪蒙军王英全部及马占山一个师，昨晚却经镇川堡绕过孤山迂回偷袭我丰镇，于今日拂晓乘虚突入城内，我旅部已被敌包围，正在顽强抗击，请纵队速派援军。
    接着，从军区和晋绥兄弟部队发来的情况通报中得知：大同敌韩步洲的省防第五军第十四师已于昨晚偷渡桑干河，正向浑源进犯。与此同时敌第十三师进犯左云。归绥国民党骑兵一部进犯和林、陶林，有续犯集宁之势；东线国民党军正分路向平泉、古北口进攻，企图占我承德。
    面对着如此严重的敌情，我们站在地图前面，进行研究，新的情况，更清楚地回答了我们会议的中心议题。果然不出中央军委所料，敌人的“和平”画皮再一次地被事实揭穿了。我们明显地看出大同的敌人在楚溪春指挥下，正分路倾巢出犯，企图利用停战令生效前迅速抢占要点。这是蒋介石统一指挥的，在全国范围内破坏和平的新阴谋的一部分。大同和归绥的敌人企图打通平绥西段和同蒲北段的连系，分割我晋察冀和晋绥、陕甘宁边区的连系；东线的敌人则企图截断我热河走廊，割断我区与东北的连系，以便进一步从东西两面夹击我张家口，为发动更大规模的内战作准备。事实雄辩地证明了毛主席的论断：“不给敢于进攻解放区的反动派很大的打击，和平是不会来的。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷1158页）根据毛主席关于“针锋相对，寸土必争”的方针和军区的预定部署，我们决定：首先歼灭敌之中路。以第四旅主力向进攻遇驾山的敌人进行反击，在粉碎敌人进攻以后，南援浑源。决定：第三旅政治委员傅崇碧同志立即率领驻阳高地区的第三旅第十一团，速回丰镇，解第三旅旅部之围。我们商定的打法和决心，在电话中向军区首长作了报告，当下就得到了聂荣臻司令员的批准，他并调冀中纵队的第十三旅从怀来于14日晨赶到阳高地区增援我们。
    任务是严重的，时间是急迫的。纵队政治部号召全军同志不顾任何疲劳，发扬连续作战的精神，不怕一切牺牲，寸土不让，分秒必争，坚决打退敌人背信弃义的进攻。干部、战士们一听说敌人对我大举进攻，人人义愤填胸，个个磨拳擦掌。纵队的反击命令下达不到半个小时，各个部队便先后从驻地出发了。怒火激动着每个战士的心，虽然没有人下跑步的命令，但是部队却在飞跑着，向遇驾山，向丰镇，向着敌人打枪的地方急进！
    遇驾山在大同东北三十多里，山不太高，但耸立在铁路北侧，控制着通往聚乐堡和阳高的铁道和公路。我第四十七团一营扼守着遇驾山的有利地形，打击着蜂拥而来的敌人。敌人是阎锡山的骑兵第四师（无马），12日夜从大同出发，13日拂晓前赶到遇驾山下的。出发前敌师长田尚志向他的部下说：“打死一个八路军赏三百元，活捉一个赏五百元，缴一支步枪赏三千元，缴一挺机枪赏一万元……”。并威逼：“任何官长不许下退却命令！”田尚志还宣布，此次进攻有日军坦克配合，一定要拿下遇驾山，打下聚乐堡，向阳高进攻。我们的战士懂得自己正在保卫和平的第一线上，全解放区和全国人民都在注视着我们。因此，作战异常英勇。战士们的口号是：“守住遇驾山，保卫解放区的人民，保卫和平！”为了节省子弹，提出打不倒敌人不放枪，敌人到跟前打手榴弹，手榴弹打光了，滚石头砸敌人。我军阵地前七横八竖地尽是敌人的尸体，敌人始终攻不上来。从早上打到中午，遇驾山仍在我军坚强控制之下。敌人正面进攻受挫以后，一部分敌人向我四十里铺迂回；敌人的主力在日本人开的坦克掩护下，向我阵地侧后的西湾子进攻。我第四十七团当即以第三营在四十里铺担任阻击，二营于南庄截击迂回的敌人，一营从遇驾山正面抓住敌人，打破敌人进攻的计划。
    这时候，我第四旅第六团从王官屯地区跑步赶来了。这支部队有老红军的底子，久经战斗考验，能攻能守。他们立即从遇驾山我军阵地两侧向敌猛烈反击。敌人迂回的部队转过头来和我六团的部队对起阵来。下午四时，我第四旅的第三十五团也从几十里以外桥头堡地区赶来了。这是一支猛打猛冲灵活机动的部队，立即向敌人的侧后方大同方向进行攻击。我第四十七团早从正面压了下来，从三面把敌人包围了，敌骑兵第四师哪里经得起我军这个分量，立即全线溃乱，夺路向西逃窜。我军各部队猛追敌人，展开了缴枪捉俘虏的比赛。敌人逃得快，我军撵得紧。原来准备和我军
  一起庆祝停战实现的遇驾山、聚乐堡附近的人
  民群众，亲眼看到国民党军向我进攻，十分气
  愤，作战中主动向我军报告敌人情况、运送弹药，妇女儿童慰问伤员，送饭送水，这时候，
  又和我军一起追击逃敌。在遇驾山通往大同的铁路、公路和田野上一片“缴枪不杀！宽待俘虏”的喊声，敌人如丧家之犬，纷纷逃命。我军战士和人民群众穷追敌人直至大同城下，打死打伤和活捉敌人一千多名，缴获步枪数百支，轻重机枪二十余挺，军用物资一部。解放
  了周士庄、倍家皂二十里铺等十多个村镇。敌师长田尚志和溃乱了的五六百个敌人，乘天色
  昏黑，逃回了大同。
    在遇驾山战斗同时，我第三旅的第十一团在旅政委傅崇碧同志率领下，不分昼夜地兼程驰援丰镇。这时候，被敌人团团包围的我第三旅旅直属队（只带有一个警卫连）情况十分危急。他们在旅长马龙同志沉着指挥下，在13
  日一天中，打退了敌人多次进攻，最后坚守着一座院落。丰镇通往外地的电话线被割断了，为了应付万一的情况，13日晚机关干部焚烧了全部机密文件，准备最后和敌人一拼。14日上午，敌人没有进攻。城东北方向传来了枪声，大家转忧为喜。旅长马龙同志立即让司号员吹号调部队进城，部队应声而至。这是我第三旅的第十团，他们13日奉命赶到孤山，协同第十二团击退了孤山的敌人，由于电话中断，听说丰镇方向有了枪声，十团团长便先率一个营向回返。14日晨在丰镇东北雁灵塔附近，听见了我旅部调集部队的号声，便立即攻入城内和敌人展开了巷战。下午四时，我第十一团和十团的主力都已赶到，向窜入我丰镇企图固守的伪蒙军王英匪部和马占山的骑兵师实行内外夹击。敌人在我猛烈打击下，人仰马翻，乱成一团，纷纷向西北方向逃窜。我第三旅主力，追击敌人的骑兵直到五十里以外的凉城地区，歼灭敌人两百多，缴获战马百余匹。另有一百多敌人，以为丰镇已抢到手，有的四出抢掠、奸淫，有的找地方抽大烟，有的喝得酩酊大醉，一听说我军主力赶到，便钻在市民家中，不敢出来，最后为我全部活捉。到14日黄昏，丰镇、孤山之线，又恢复了1月13日以前的位置。丰镇人民家家挂起红旗，庆祝我军反击敌人的胜利。
    这时候，在大同通往浑源的路上，我第四旅的第三十五团和第四十七团的战士们，正在强行军和急行军。没有人说话，只有擦擦擦擦的跑步声。他们是遇驾山战斗刚一结束，就立即兼程南下的。他们的任务是：立即赶到浑源，协同冀晋第五军分区的部队，歼灭在13日晚抢占了我浑源城的蒋阎军第十四师。
    浑源城位于雁门关北，大同东南，是雁北通往北岳区的一个要冲，也是大同川物产最富饶的地方。我第四旅的战士们大都是雁北的子弟兵，雁北广大地区，包括浑源县城，大都是他们解放的。战士们一听说浑源城被敌人抢占了，恨不得立刻插翅飞到浑源去歼灭敌人。从大同东北到浑源约一百八十里的路程，一天一夜便赶到了。我第三十五团中途还在吉家庄打了一仗，把浑源敌十四师的后勤辎重全部截获。14日晚上我第三十五团、四十七团赶到浑源以后，当即向敌人展开攻击。我第四十七团主力在城东前庙歼灭了敌人一个排，张家庄的敌人在我四十七团狠狠打击下，被迫于15日拂晓前撤回浑源城。我第三十五团附第四十七团第二营当即猛攻西关歼敌第四十一团一个营大部，紧逼浑源城下。
    15日，抢占浑源的敌人，企图以抢占的既成事实，等待执行小组前来“调处”。他们纠集了优势兵力向我第三十五团实施了三次反冲击。我第三十五团三营的战士们与敌人在西门外进行了肉搏，打垮了敌人的反扑。下午四时，应县的敌人前来增援，在水磨町附近受到我五分区部队的坚决抗击。下午五时，我第四旅以第三十五团及四十七团之第三营从西面向东打，我四十七团主力从东面向西打，同时攻城。第三十五团的战士们在炮火掩护下，登上西门城墙，以白刃格斗冲垮了敌人。残敌见他们的增援无望，哪敢恋战，乘黑夜弃城向大同方向逃窜。我军一直追到桑干河边，俘敌数百余人，缴获山炮一门，其余的大部逃散。一部为我驰援浑源的三十九团在路上截获，被打得溃不成军，残部逃回了大同。为阎匪军一度抢占的浑源城又回到人民的怀抱。至此我军全线粉碎了大同阎伪军楚溪春部抢占我阳高、浑源、丰镇地区的阴谋。
    从13日起，我们生活在紧张的战争气氛
  中。从电话机上不断地和军区及各部队通话，
  电报也忙碌地和上下联系。我们纵队的几个负责人昼夜坐在作战室里。15日，当我军攻入浑源城的消息传来时，我们的心情刚刚松快了一些，马上又接到军区的电示：国民党军已于14
  日违约侵占我集宁，军区急令我纵队全力配合绥蒙军区兄弟部队坚决歼灭侵占集宁的敌人。我们立即命令第三旅除留一部兵力在孤山丰镇地区积极牵制大同之敌外，主力和第四旅的第六团急速北上，参加战斗。
    集宁是绥东重镇，张家口西北最重要的战略据点。这个地方关系到张家口和整个绥东的得失，是不能让敌人占去的。我们的部队，往返调动在浑源、大同、丰镇一线，已经打了几天几夜，根本没有休息。但是，这个任务比夺回丰镇、浑源的任务还要严重得多。我第三旅接到这一命令，立即从丰镇乘了四列火车赶赴集宁。走出丰镇不远，几架蒋介石的飞机低空向我们的列车和行军队伍扫射轰炸，列车上架起轻重机枪边走边打。敌机不敢低飞，仓皇地扔了几个炸弹，机枪乱扫了一阵就灰溜溜地飞走了。列车加速前进，伴随着有节奏的动荡声，歌声响了起来：
      “谁种的庄稼谁收割，
      谁栽的果木谁得果，
    我们流血抗战八年多，
    胜利果实谁也不能夺。……”
    一遍唱过了，又唱第二遍。歌声理直气壮，豪迈有力，充分流露了战士们激愤的心情。
    15日傍晚，狂风怒吼，飞砂走石。我第三旅主力乘车来到集宁以南十五里的苏集车站。部队没有片刻停留，立即会同兄弟部队向攻击出发地开进。当夜，在大风砂中，我军各部队向集宁外围的卧龙山、老虎山匍匐前进，发起攻击。经过彻夜冲杀，到16日拂晓前，我军占领了集宁外围的全部阵地。敌乘我军立足未稳连续三次向我反扑，均被我击退。敌被迫在纵深火力掩护下，退守市内和城关。我为巩固已得阵地，并密切配合城西北绥蒙军区兄弟部队，继续压缩敌人，给最后围歼敌人作好充分准备，16日黄昏，我军从正北、正西、西南、正南四个方向开始了猛攻。
    16日深夜，我在阳高司令部收到集宁前线总攻的报告不久，便接到军区聂司令员电报说：“军事调处执行部执行小组17日十二时前将飞集宁视察，希速督令第三旅和第六团，协同友军，争取时间，不惜任何代价，坚决尽速歼灭进犯集宁之敌，力争在17日十时前结束战斗。”显然，这个时候执行小组前来，是敌人玩弄“贼喊捉贼”的伎俩。因此，我们必须坚决执行军区指示，尽快地从敌人手中把集宁夺回来。于是，我们立即电转第三旅负责同志执行。电报发出去了，我们守候在作战室里，等待消息。这一夜，好长啊！窗外一阵紧似一阵的西北风呼啸而过。我想：已经是三九天了，在集宁那个来自蒙古高原的大风口上，战士们握紧枪的手恐怕是早已冻僵了吧！想到这里，我们觉得窗外的寒风好像吹在我们的身上一样。但我们深信战士们坚强的战斗意志，我们深信在党和毛主席抚育下成长起来的战士们，一定会完成这一艰巨而光荣的任务的，但是时间太紧迫了，又怎么不令人担心和焦急呢？
    天近破晓，我们和集宁前线通了几次电话。我军已三次猛攻集宁，但仍未能突破。敌我均有很大伤亡。据马龙和傅崇碧同志报告，他们都亲到城下观察，寻找突破口。他们还说：战士们斗志旺盛，不少人负了伤仍坚持不下火线，没有负伤的战士身上的棉衣，也被铁丝网撕扯得露出棉花，但没有一个叫苦的。他们并转达前沿阵地指挥员十一团二营营长刘智理同志的建议：坚决打下去，坚决把集宁从敌人手中夺回来！这是多么英雄的感人的气概呀！这是上下一致的意见：坚决打下去，一定要把集宁夺回来！
    17日晨八时，最后的一次总攻开始了。各部队从四面八方同时动作起来。我第三旅选择了西北城角城墙有裂缝的地段作为主攻方向。我第十一团有四个年青的共产党员，自告奋勇前去爆破，旅、团集中了所有轻重机枪封锁裂缝两侧的火力点。第十一团二营营长刘智理身挂重花仍在外壕上指挥爆破组进行爆破。第一个战士携带炸药冲了上去被敌人打倒了，第二个跟着跑上去又倒下了，部队还是上不去。谁都知道：离开执行小组到集宁视察的时间只有三四个钟头了。战斗的结局，不仅关系着整个反抢占要点战役的成败，关系着张家口和绥东的安危，同时，夺不回集宁，敌人的谎言便不能被揭穿，我们在政治上就会处于被动。这时候，四连战士共产党员魏占祥，一纵身子窜出了外壕，直奔城墙。原来他身上早已经背好了几十斤炸药。当他快接近城墙时，突然倒了下来。人们心中一惊，真为他担心，那知他又从地上一跃而起，一直冲上城墙根。这时候他已是第二次负伤了，仍竭尽全力把身子贴在城墙的裂缝上。突然，火光一闪，“轰隆”一声巨响，城墙上出现了一个大缺口。共产党员魏占祥同志，以自己宝贵的生命为突击部队打开了通路。在晋绥兄弟部队首长统一指挥下，我军各部队潮水般地杀进集宁城。到十一时战斗全部结束。活捉敌人两千余，战马一千多匹。残敌骑兵一部跳城向西逃窜。十二时整，战场刚刚打扫完毕。军调部执行小组的一架银白色的飞机，降落在集宁。美蒋代表是应国民党军的请求前来的。他们满以为十分适时地赶到集宁就可以为他们违约攻占集宁这一既成事实进行庇护，并企图借此反咬我一口。可惜这一出双簧戏没有搭配好。当时他们只好面面相觑张口结舌，不得不确认：集宁在13日以前就在我军控制之下。
    在集宁告捷的同时，东线进犯我古北口之敌亦被我军击退。敌人抢夺战略要点的阴谋终于失败了。我们赢得了一个短暂的和平局面。但更重要的是，通过这一场斗争，为我军广大指战员和人民群众上了宝贵的一课，尽管当时，美帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派口头上大讲“和平”，并且也可以和我们订立“停战协定”，但是正如毛主席所指出的：“纸上的东西并不等于现实的东西”，（《毛泽东选集》第四卷1155页）他们的反动本质是不会改变的。从纸上的东西变为现实的东西，要用我们的斗争去争取。（附图片）
