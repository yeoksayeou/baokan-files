Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, December 15th: According to a report in the Belgian Communist Party's newspaper *Red Flag* today, Nzuzy, Secretary of the Youth Organization of the Congolese National Movement Party led by Prime Minister Lumumba, was recently murdered by the Mobutu group in the Luzumu prison on the outskirts of Leopoldville. Nzuzy was illegally arrested by this traitorous group several weeks ago.

The newspaper also stated that the Governor of Orientale Province, Finant (a member of the Congolese National Movement Party), who was illegally arrested by the Mobutu gang in October of this year, is still being held in Luzumu prison, suffering inhuman torture.

The newspaper said that at the same time, rumors are circulating in Leopoldville that the Minister of Information of Lumumba's legitimate government, Kashamura, and the Speaker of the Congolese Senate, Okito, have been murdered. Both were illegally arrested at the same time as Mobutu's armed kidnapping of Prime Minister Lumumba.

    据新华社布鲁塞尔15日电　据比利时共产党机关报《红旗报》今天报道，卢蒙巴总理领导的刚果民族运动党青年组织书记恩祖齐最近已经在利奥波德维尔郊外的卢祖穆监狱中，被蒙博托集团杀害。恩祖齐是在几个星期以前被这个叛国集团非法逮捕的。
    这家报纸还说，在今年10月间被蒙博托匪帮非法逮捕的东方省省长菲南（刚果民族运动党成员）仍被关在卢祖穆监狱里，受着非人的折磨。
    这家报纸说，在这同时，利奥波德维尔正流传着卢蒙巴合法政府的新闻部长卡沙缪拉和刚果参议院议长奥基托被杀害的消息，他们两人是在蒙博托武装绑架卢蒙巴总理的同一个时候被非法逮捕的。
