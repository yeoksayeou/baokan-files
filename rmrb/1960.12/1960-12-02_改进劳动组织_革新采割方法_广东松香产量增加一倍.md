Improving Labor Organization, Innovating Resin Tapping Methods
Guangdong's Rosin Production Doubles

(Our newspaper, Guangzhou, 1st dispatch) Guangdong Province has achieved great success in rosin production this year. As of November 15th, the province's rosin production has increased by more than double compared to the same period last year. The quality has fully met national standards, while the labor force used has been reduced by about two-thirds compared to last year. Currently, seven key rosin-producing counties in the province have completed the national plan ahead of schedule, and more than 30 high-yield experts with an annual output of 10,000 jin of resin have emerged. The general resin tapping efficiency has also increased by more than 30% compared to last year.

Guangdong is a major rosin-producing area in China. In order to meet the needs of industrial sectors across the country for rosin, all production areas in the province, following the provincial party committee's instruction to "seize from the beginning, seize tightly, and seize to the end," broke the usual practice of "going up the mountains around the Qingming Festival and coming down around the Frost's Descent." This year, from the beginning of spring, they organized labor to go up the mountains to carry out the spring resin tapping campaign. Cadres at all levels in the production areas went deep into the front lines, participated in production, led production, and guided the masses to actively promote chemical resin tapping and promptly solve specific problems encountered in production. As a result, the rosin production tasks completed in the first half of the year increased by more than four times compared to the same period last year, gaining the initiative to ensure the completion of the annual plan.

Improving the labor organization of resin tapping, with the establishment of resin tapping farms as the center, and implementing the industrialization and basing of resin production, is the key to improving the efficiency of resin tapping and achieving reduced labor and increased production. Since the beginning of this year, more than 200 resin tapping farms have been established throughout the province, with a professional resin tapping team of more than 20,000 people. This form of labor organization not only adapts to the needs of year-round resin tapping but also facilitates strengthening leadership and implementing industrial management methods, which has played an extremely important role in promoting technological innovation and technological revolution in resin tapping and improving labor efficiency. Since the beginning of spring this year, the high-efficiency movement of "tapping a thousand trees a day and producing ten thousand jin of resin a year" in various production areas has been wave after wave. The hook-up competitions and opponent competitions between experts, teams, and farms are in full swing. The resin tapping professional team in Shixing County, in the competition of "high single-plant yield, high average yield, and high attendance efficiency," in order to overcome the difficulties of the rainy season, built simple sheds every one to two li in the resin tapping farm. When it rained heavily, they went into the sheds to shelter from the rain, and after the rain, they rushed to tap the resin, so that the average daily output of the whole team remained above 48 jin, and they have now overfulfilled the annual plan by 20% three months ahead of schedule. This year, the method of chemical resin tapping has been widely promoted in various resin-producing areas in the province. The resin tapping farm of the Junxu Brigade of the Dong'an Commune in Gaozhou County has fully implemented chemical resin tapping. The number of resin tappers has been reduced by 30 compared to last year, but the resin output has increased by more than double compared to the same period last year. In addition, many advanced resin tapping methods have been further promoted this year. Luo Lixian, a resin tapping expert in Renhua County, adopted these advanced resin tapping methods and created the province's highest record of producing more than 18,000 jin of resin annually.

In terms of rosin processing, various localities have implemented decentralized processing based on the distribution of resin tapping farms, which not only saves the labor force for transporting resin but also reduces the deterioration of resin and the volatilization and waste of turpentine during transportation, improving the quality of rosin.

### 改进劳动组织　革新采割方法  广东松香产量增加一倍

    改进劳动组织　革新采割方法
    广东松香产量增加一倍
    本报广州1日电　广东省今年松香生产成绩很大，到11月15日止，全省松香产量比去年同期增长一倍多，质量全部达到国家标准，而使用的劳动力却比去年减少三分之二左右。现在全省已有七个产松香的重点县提前完成国家计划，并出现了年产万斤松脂的高产能手三十多人，一般的采脂工效也比去年提高30％以上。
    广东是我国松香的主要产区。为了满足全国各地工业部门对松香的需要，全省各产区根据省委“一开始就抓，抓紧、抓到底”的指示，打破了往年“清明上山、霜降下山”的常规，今年一开春，就组织劳动力上山，开展春季采脂运动。产区的各级干部深入第一线，参加生产领导生产，带领群众积极推广化学采脂和及时解决生产上遇到的具体问题，因而上半年完成的松香生产任务比去年同期增长了四倍多，为保证全年计划的完成，赢得了主动。
    改进采脂的劳动组织，以建立采脂场为中心，实行松脂生产工场化，基地化，是提高采脂工作效率，实现减人增产的关键。今年以来，全省已建立采脂场二百多个，拥有采脂专业队伍二万多人。这种劳动组织形式，不仅适应了常年采脂的需要，而且有利于加强领导，实行工场化的管理方法，对推动采脂技术革新和技术革命运动的开展、提高劳动效率，起了极其重要的作用。今年入春以来，各产区“日割千株树，年产万斤脂”的高工效运动，一浪高过一浪，能手与能手、队与队、场与场之间的挂钩赛、对手赛，闹得如火如荼。始兴县采脂专业队在开展“单株产量高、平均产量高、出勤工效高”的竞赛中，为了克服多雨季节的困难，他们在采脂场中每隔一到二华里就搭个简易工棚，大雨时进工棚躲雨，雨后进行抢割，使全队个人平均日产量一直保持在四十八斤以上，现已提前三个月超额20％完成了年计划。今年全省各产脂区普遍推广了化学采脂方法。高州县东岸公社均圩大队采脂场，全部实行化学采脂，采脂人数比去年减少三十人，但松脂产量却比去年同期增长两倍多。此外，许多先进的采脂法，今年也获得进一步推广。仁化县的采脂能手罗立先，采取这些先进采脂方法，创造了年产一万八千多斤松脂的全省最高纪录。
    在松香加工方面，各地根据采脂场的分布情况，实行分散加工，既节约了松脂运输的劳动力，也减少了运输过程中松脂变质和松节油挥发浪费现象，提高了松香的质量。（附图片）
