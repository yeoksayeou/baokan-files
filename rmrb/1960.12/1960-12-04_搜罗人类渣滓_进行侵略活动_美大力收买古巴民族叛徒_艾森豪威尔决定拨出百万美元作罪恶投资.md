    Scouring for Human Scum to Carry Out Aggression
    The US Vigorously Buys Off Cuban National Traitors
    Eisenhower Decides to Allocate Millions of Dollars for Sinister Investment
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 3rd. US President Eisenhower, under the guise of "relieving" so-called Cuban "refugees," has ordered one million dollars to be allocated from the "Mutual Security Fund" to recruit Cuban counter-revolutionaries in the United States and engage them in activities to subvert Cuba.
    White House Press Secretary Hagerty officially announced the news on the 2nd.
    Eisenhower also met on the 2nd with Voorhees, who is in charge of recruiting Cuban exiles in the United States, and listened to his "report." After the failure of the Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebellion instigated by the United States in 1956, Voorhees was chairman of the US President's so-called "Hungarian Refugee Relief Committee."
    On November 10th of this year, he was ordered by Eisenhower to investigate the so-called Cuban "refugee problem."
    Voorhees stated in his report that these dregs of the Cuban nation, who will be organized by the American reactionaries, are currently "mostly concentrated in Florida," a place across the sea from Cuba.
    USIS also revealed that, in addition to the one million dollars allocated by Eisenhower, the so-called "private charitable organizations and companies" in the United States will also provide funds to buy off traitors to the Cuban people who have fled to the United States.

    搜罗人类渣滓  进行侵略活动
    美大力收买古巴民族叛徒
    艾森豪威尔决定拨出百万美元作罪恶投资
    新华社3日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔以“救济”所谓古巴“难民”为名，命令从“共同安全基金”中拨出一百万美元来招收在美国的古巴反革命分子，要他们从事颠复古巴的活动。
    白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂2日正式宣布了这个消息。
    艾森豪威尔2日还接见了负责网罗在美国的古巴亡命分子工作的伏希斯，并且听取了他的“报告”。当美国在1956年策动的匈牙利反革命叛乱失败后，伏希斯是美国总统的所谓“匈牙利难民救济委员会”主席。
    他在今年11月10日又奉艾森豪威尔之命调查所谓古巴“难民问题”。
    伏希斯在报告中表明，这些将被美国反动派组织起来的古巴民族的渣滓，目前“大部分集中在佛罗里达州”这个和古巴隔海相望的地方。
    美新处还透露，除了艾森豪威尔拨出的一百万美元之外，美国的所谓“私人慈善机关和公司”也将提供款项来收买逃亡在美国的古巴人民的叛徒。
