    Being Responsible to the End
    After Wuxi city's factories, enterprises, and urban communes saved a large number of personnel and sent them to the countryside, they continued to cooperate with rural Party organizations to conduct ideological education for the dispatched workers and help solve some practical problems. This practice embodies a valuable spirit of being responsible to the end.
    Urban support for rural areas and industrial support for agriculture are important components of the entire Party and people's efforts to develop agriculture and grain production on a large scale. To successfully complete the task of supporting rural areas and agriculture, it is necessary to have a truly responsible spirit. Industrial and other departments saving labor and sending it to the agricultural front is the completion of an important task in supporting agriculture. However, after the dispatched personnel arrive in the countryside, their active role must be fully utilized. This requires conducting ideological and political work on them, helping them quickly master agricultural production techniques, and solving their specific problems in production and life, and so on. Of course, these tasks should mainly be done by rural communes. But can the original units also contribute to doing these tasks well? They can contribute, and they should contribute. Wuxi city's factories, enterprises, and urban communes have done this and achieved good results.
    The key here is the degree of awareness of supporting agriculture. Deeply understanding the Party Central Committee's policy of taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, being full of enthusiasm for supporting agriculture, will lead to demanding higher standards of oneself and treating all work to support agriculture with a serious and responsible spirit to the end.

    负责到底
    无锡市各工厂企业和城市公社，在节约了大批人力送往农村以后，还继续协同农村党组织对下乡职工进行思想教育，并且帮助解决一些实际问题。这种作法体现了一种可贵的负责到底的精神。
    城市支援农村，工业支援农业，是全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的一项重要内容。要很好地完成支援农村、支援农业的任务，就要有切实负责到底的精神。工业等部门节约出劳动力送往农业战线，是完成了支援农业的一项重要工作。但是，下乡人员到农村以后，要充分发挥他们的积极作用。这就要对他们进行思想政治工作，帮助他们迅速掌握农业生产技术，为他们解决生产、生活方面的具体问题，等等。当然，这些工作主要应该由农村公社来作。但是，原单位是否也可以为做好这些工作出一份力量呢？可以出一份力量，也应该出一份力量。无锡市工厂企业和城市公社这样做了，收到了良好的效果。
    这里的关键是对支援农业的自觉程度。深刻地领会了党中央关于国民经济以农业为基础的方针，对支援农业满腹热情，就会以高标准要求自己，以认真严肃、负责到底的精神对待支援农业的各项工作。
