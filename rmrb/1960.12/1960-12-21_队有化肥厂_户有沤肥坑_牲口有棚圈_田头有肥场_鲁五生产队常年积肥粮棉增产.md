Luwu Production Team Increases Grain and Cotton Production Through Year-Round Fertilizer Accumulation
Cultivated Land's Fertilizer Application Increases Year by Year, Despite Suffering Relatively Severe Disasters This Year, Grain Yield per Unit Area is Still Higher Than Other Teams

(Our Dispatch) The Luwu Production Team of Xiyang Commune, Sanyuan County, Shaanxi Province, focuses on year-round fertilizer accumulation, vigorously developing farmyard manure, so that the average fertilizer application per mu of cultivated land has increased year by year to more than 30,000 jin, and various crops such as grain, cotton, oil, and vegetables have increased production year after year. This year, although they suffered relatively severe drought and flood disasters, the average grain yield per mu still reached more than 420 jin, about 40% higher than production teams with similar conditions in the area.

The Luwu Production Team is an economic crop team mainly focused on cotton. In addition to 500 mu of cotton fields, all the remaining cultivated land in the team is double-cropped. Based on the local conditions of good water conservancy but insufficient fertilizer, they have focused on year-round fertilizer accumulation and have accumulated a complete set of experiences.

The Party branch of the Luwu Production Team, in the process of grasping fertilizer, often uses various forms to educate the masses on "accumulating fertilizer is like accumulating grain, and more fertilizer means full granaries," so that the commune members realize that not grasping fertilizer firmly is the same as not grasping grain firmly.

Year-Round Planning, Taking a Step Ahead
At the same time, an important experience for adhering to year-round fertilizer accumulation is year-round planning, taking a step ahead. At the beginning of each year, the production team, based on the annual planting area and crop varieties, proposes the team's year-round fertilizer accumulation plan from bottom to top, and the tasks are assigned to small teams by plots of land. The small teams then, based on this plan, assign the fertilizer accumulation tasks to the breeding rooms, to households, and to individuals. This fertilizer accumulation plan includes two parts: one part is year-round fertilizer accumulation, such as accumulating pen manure, commune member household fertilizer, and making soil fertilizer, which are accumulated and manufactured year-round, regardless of winter or summer; the other part is a concentrated fertilizer accumulation effort, such as temporary collective efforts to search for fertilizer and compost it. This comprehensive planning and early arrangement ensures that each small team and even each commune member has a clear understanding, achieving early knowledge of annual fertilizer accumulation and ensuring the completion of their respective fertilizer accumulation tasks on a monthly basis.

The collective concentrated fertilizer accumulation tasks are uniformly arranged by the production team. Based on natural conditions, crop needs, and the amount of year-round fertilizer accumulation, superior forces are organized to carry out short-term concentrated efforts. Generally, there are four concentrated efforts a year: in spring, searching for and accumulating fast-acting fertilizer for wheat regrowth; after the summer harvest, taking advantage of the vigorous growth of green grass and the abundance of wheat bran and rainwater, composting base fertilizer for autumn-sown crops; in autumn, concentrating on building kang beds and demolishing walls to search for fast-acting fertilizer for autumn fields to promote ear and grain development; in late autumn and early winter, using weeds and autumn rice chaff to compost base fertilizer for next year's spring-sown crops. Year-round fertilizer accumulation is the main focus, supplemented by concentrated fertilizer accumulation; year-round fertilizer accumulation is implemented throughout, and concentrated fertilizer accumulation is interspersed seasonally. Each small team also has a three-person fertilizer accumulation team, which is specifically responsible for regularly checking the completion of fertilizer accumulation tasks in each breeding room and each commune member household. In this way, whether it is year-round or concentrated fertilizer accumulation, tasks are completed according to plan month by month and season by season, achieving spring preparation for summer and summer storage for autumn.

Pricing Based on Grade, Rewarding Excess
Strictly implementing the fertilizer accumulation policy of pricing based on grade, cash purchase, work point recording, and rewarding excess is the guarantee for this production team's significant achievements in adhering to year-round fertilizer accumulation. They divide fertilizer remuneration into three major categories: one is pen manure, one is commune member household fertilizer, and one is collective fertilizer accumulation. Pen manure is assigned according to the number of livestock and is subject to rewards and penalties. The monthly fertilizer accumulation quota for each adult livestock is four large carts, and extra work points are calculated for exceeding the quota, with additional cash rewards. In order to ensure the quality of fertilizer accumulation, each livestock is not allowed to accumulate more than five large carts of fertilizer per month. In terms of pig manure, the monthly quota for each pig is one and a half carts, and work points are awarded for exceeding the quota, but the excess is also not allowed to be too large. Commune member household fertilizer is priced based on grade and purchased with cash. In order to encourage commune members to accumulate more and better fertilizer, they have increased the grade difference in fertilizer prices. First, the masses propose a payment method based on the actual situation, and then the cadres personally try it for a certain period of time before discussing and deciding on the remuneration. If the situation changes during the execution of the quota (such as poor road conditions after rain), the quota is readjusted according to the suggestions of the masses. Because the remuneration is reasonable and guaranteed to be honored, the enthusiasm of the commune members has been greatly mobilized, and everyone strives to accumulate more and better fertilizer.

In order to further encourage the commune members' enthusiasm for fertilizer accumulation, the Party branch of the Luwu Production Team also frequently organizes red flag bearer competitions for fertilizer accumulation, commending the advanced and driving the less advanced. This autumn, the brigade rewarded a group of advanced units and individuals who had completed the fertilizer accumulation tasks with guaranteed quality and quantity, and selected sixteen fertilizer accumulation pacesetters such as Liu Shengyu and Yang Taifu, which greatly encouraged the commune members. The Second Small Team, which had previously been poor in fertilizer accumulation work, quickly caught up after the evaluation and made a concerted effort to accumulate enough grain-promoting fertilizer for sixty mu of corn.

Establishing a Year-Round Fertilizer Accumulation Network
In the process of grasping year-round fertilizer accumulation, the Luwu Production Team has also built a year-round fertilizer accumulation network: composed of public toilets, composting pits, compost yards, pig, cattle, and sheep pens, and fertilizer plants. The entire production team has a total of eight public toilets, located at the entrances of villages and along roads with more pedestrian traffic. Composting pits are divided into two types: commune member household and field collective. The entire production team of 140 commune member households has more than 150 small household composting pits, located in front of and behind their residences, making it convenient for commune members to manage and care for them in their spare time. The four small teams have a total of more than 30 large field collective composting pits. The setting is based on water sources, raw materials, and roads, distributed in the fields to reduce the labor of transporting fertilizer back and forth. The entire production team has a total of fifteen compost yards, eight of which are distributed in front of the breeding rooms and at the entrances of villages in each small team. The pen manure coming out of the breeding rooms and the compost fertilizer purchased from the commune members are crushed, piled up, and re-composted in these yards to make the fertilizer re-ferment, re-rot, and improve fertilizer efficiency. The remaining seven compost yards are located in the fields according to the distribution of the land, and during the slack season, the re-composted fertilizer is transported to these yards, saving labor for transporting fertilizer during the busy season. Now, here it is: the team has a fertilizer plant, households have composting pits, pigs, sheep, cattle, and horses have pens, there are public toilets by the roadside, one large composting pit for forty mu of land, and one field compost yard for two hundred mu of land, forming a complete set of relatively complete year-round fertilizer accumulation network.

Seizing the Initiative in Production
The result of the Luwu Production Team's adherence to year-round fertilizer accumulation and concentrated fertilizer accumulation is a significant increase in fertilizer sources, which makes all agricultural activities more proactive and management measures more scientific. The basic solution to the fertilizer quantity problem first ensures that fertilizer waits for the crops, not crops waiting for fertilizer, and that enough fertilizer is prepared in advance for each season according to the sowing area and crop varieties. During the autumn field management period this year, their compost yards and composting pits have stockpiled and composted more than 6.2 million jin of base fertilizer for autumn-sown crops; now, while applying "overwintering fertilizer" to wheat fields in large quantities, the composting pits and compost yards are also preparing fertilizer for cotton field sowing next spring. Secondly, it has greatly improved fertilizer efficiency. This year, 86% of the fertilizer used for autumn sowing in this team was re-composted and stockpiled, with very high quality. Thirdly, with a sufficient quantity of fertilizer, it can be rationally allocated and applied rationally according to different soil textures, stubble, and different growth periods of different crops, so that whatever fertilizer is needed is applied. Fourthly, it can adjust the busy and slack periods of agricultural work, arrange the work in advance, and strive to take the initiative. For example, when the Third Small Team planted wheat this year, because most of the fertilizer had already been stockpiled in the fields and applied to the fields in advance, the sowing work was nearly half a month faster than other production teams. At the same time, because the two most labor-intensive processes of temporary fertilizer accumulation and fertilizer transportation were eliminated, most of the labor was concentrated on plowing and planting, using one more work day per mu than other production teams, making the autumn sowing work more meticulous.

    队有化肥厂　户有沤肥坑　牲口有棚圈　田头有肥场
    鲁五生产队常年积肥粮棉增产
    耕地施肥量逐年增加，今年虽遭较重灾害，粮食单产仍高出其他队
    本报讯　陕西三原县西阳公社鲁五生产队，以常年积肥为主，大办农家肥料，使每亩耕地平均施肥量逐年增加到三万多斤，粮、棉、油、菜等各种作物连年增产。今年，这里虽遭受了较重的旱涝灾害，粮食平均亩产仍达到四百二十多斤，高出当地同等条件生产队的40％左右。
    鲁五生产队是个以棉花为主的经济作物队，全队耕地除五百亩棉田外，其余全是复种地。他们根据当地水利条件较好，肥料赶不上需要的情况，狠抓常年积肥，并积累了一套完整的经验。
    鲁五生产队党支部在抓肥料过程中，经常运用各种形式，向群众进行“积肥如积粮，肥多粮满仓”的教育，使社员认识到，抓肥不狠，就是抓粮不狠。
    常年规划　早走一步
    同时坚持常年积肥的一条重要经验，就是常年规划，早走一步。每年初，生产队就根据全年的种植面积和作物品种，自下而上提出全生产队的常年积肥计划，任务按地块落实到小队。小队再根据这个计划，把积肥任务落实到饲养室、到户、到人。这个积肥计划包括两部分：一部分是常年积肥，如积圈肥、社员家肥、制土化肥等，不分冬夏，常年积造；另一部分是突击积肥，临时集体突击搜肥、沤肥等。这样全面规划，早作安排，就使各小队以至每个社员心中有数，做到一年积肥早知道，保证按月完成各自的积肥任务。
    集体突击积肥任务，由生产小队统一安排，根据自然条件、作物需要和常年积肥数量，组织优势兵力进行短期突击。大体是一年突击四次：春季为小麦返青搜积速效肥；夏收后趁青草旺盛，麦糠、雨水多的大好时机，为秋播作物突击沤制底肥；秋季突击打炕、拆墙，为秋田搜积攻穗、攻粒速效肥；秋末冬初，利用野草和秋禾糠衣为明年春播作物沤底肥。常年积肥为主，突击积肥为辅；常年积肥贯彻始终，突击积肥按季穿插进行。各小队还设有三人积肥小组，专职负责定期检查各饲养室和各户社员积肥任务完成情况。这样，不论常年或突击积肥，都月月季季按计划完成任务，做到春为夏备，夏为秋存。
    按等论价超额奖励
    严格执行按等论价、现金收买、评工记分、超额奖励的积肥政策，是这个生产队坚持常年积肥获得显著成绩的保证。他们把积肥报酬分为三大类：一是圈肥，一是社员家肥，一是集体积肥。圈肥按牲口头数落实，实行奖惩。每头成年牲口，每月积肥定额为四大车，超额多计工分，另奖现金。为了保证积肥质量，每头牲口每月积肥不得超过五大车。猪肥方面，每头每月定额一车半，超额奖工分，同样不得超额过多。社员家肥，分等论价，现金收买。为了鼓励社员多积好肥，他们加大了肥料的等级差价。先由群众根据实际情况提出付酬办法，干部再亲自试做一定时间，然后议定报酬。在执行定额中如果情况有所变化（如阴雨后路不好走），就根据群众建议，重新调整定额。由于报酬合理，保证兑现，大大调动了社员的积极性，人人力争多积肥、积好肥。
    为了进一步鼓舞社员积肥干劲，鲁五生产队党支部还经常组织积肥红旗手竞赛活动，表彰先进，带动后进。今年秋季，大队奖励了一批保质保量完成积肥任务的先进单位和个人，评选出刘生玉、杨太复等十六个积肥标兵，对社员鼓舞很大。平常积肥工作较差的二小队，评比后急起直追，一鼓作气给六十亩玉米积够施足了攻粒肥。
    建立常年积肥网
    鲁五生产队在抓常年积肥过程中，还建设了常年积肥网：由公共厕所、沤肥坑、堆肥场、猪牛羊圈和化肥厂组成。全生产队共有八个公共厕所，设立在来往行人较多的村头和公路两旁。沤肥坑分社员家庭的和田间集体的两种。全生产队一百四十户社员，共有家庭小沤肥坑一百五十多个，设立在自己住宅的庄前院后，便于社员用零星时间经营照管。四个小队共有田间集体大沤肥坑三十多个。设置情况是就水源、就原料、就道路分布在田间，减少往返运肥的劳力。全生产队共有堆肥场十五个，八个分布在各小队饲养室前和村头。把饲养室出来的圈肥和收买社员的沤肥，在这些场上打碎堆实复沤，使肥料再发酵、再腐熟，提高肥效。其余七个堆肥场，按土地分布情况设在田间，在农闲时把复沤过的肥料运到这些场上，节省农忙时运肥的劳力。现在，这里是：队有化肥厂、户有沤肥坑、猪羊牛马有圈、路旁有公厕、四十亩地一个大沤肥坑、二百亩地一个田头堆肥场，形成一整套较完整的常年积肥网。
    生产争得主动权
    鲁五生产队坚持常年积肥与突击积肥的结果，肥源大大增加，从而使各项农事活动更加主动，管理措施更加科学。肥料数量问题的基本解决，首先做到肥等庄稼，不是庄稼等肥，季季能提前按播种面积和作物品种备足肥料。今年秋田管理期间，他们的堆肥场和沤肥坑里就为秋播作物堆放和沤制了六百二十多万斤底肥；现在，在给麦田大施“越冬肥”的同时，沤肥坑与堆肥场里又为明春棉田播种准备下了肥料。其次，大大提高了肥效。今年这个队秋播用的肥料有86％重新沤制和堆放腐熟过，质量很高。第三，有了足够数量的肥料，能合理调剂，按不同土质、茬口以及不同作物的不同生长时期，合理施肥，做到需什么肥施什么肥。第四，可以调剂农活忙闲，提前安排好活路，力争主动。如第三小队今年种麦时，由于大部分肥料已经事先堆在地头、施在田间，播种工作比其他生产队快了近半个月。同时由于省去了临时积肥、运肥两道花劳力最多的工序，大部分劳力就集中到整地下种工作上来，每亩地比别的生产队多用一个多工，使秋播工作做得更加细致。
