    The Well-Deserved Granary Team
    -- A Record of the Victory of the Milang Brigade's Farming System Reform
    Our Reporter Huang Yue, Correspondent Huang Xiantian

    This year, the Milang Brigade of Poxin Commune, Dianbai County, Guangdong Province, has, due to adapting to local conditions and actively and steadily reforming the farming system, expanded the multiple cropping index and implemented a rational crop rotation system of grain and oil crops, resulting in increased production of various crops. It has changed from a consistently grain-deficient area to one with surplus grain. This year, it provided an average of 190 jin of commercial grain and 25 jin of peanut oil to the state per person.
    The Milang Brigade is located in the hilly area of ​​subtropical western Guangdong, where the soil is not very good and prone to drought. The team has 5,296 people but only 5,245 mu of arable land. With limited land and a large population, the grain produced was not enough to eat. It used to be a well-known poor area, but the people here gave this place an auspicious name, called "Milang Township," expressing their wishes. Although the name was taken long ago, it has only become a truly well-deserved "Milang Township" in recent years.
    The Milang Brigade has a large population and little land, so it should make full use of the land to grow more grain. However, in the past, due to the limitations of backward productive forces, the long-inherited backward farming system rarely changed. For example, before the communization in 1958, less than a quarter of the team's land was planted for three seasons a year, and most of the fields were only planted for two seasons or one season. Under the leadership of the county party committee and the commune party committee, the cadres and masses of the Milang Brigade carried out the reform of the farming system in a planned and step-by-step manner. The main content of the reform was to change two crops a year to three crops, and to implement reasonable crop rotation of rice, sweet potatoes, and peanuts.
    In the reform of the farming system, the team cadres went deep into reality and among the masses to investigate and analyze the land of the whole community and to understand the various types of soil and natural conditions. Appropriate countermeasures were taken based on different lands.
    According to the results of the investigation and analysis of the team's arable land by cadres and the masses, the team's arable land is divided into five categories:
    The first category has fertile soil and good water conservancy conditions, planting rice in spring and summer, and sweet potatoes in winter. This type of field totals 1,200 mu and the usage is relatively reasonable, basically unchanged from the original planting method.
    The second category has soil and water conservancy conditions slightly worse than the first category, planting two seasons a year, peanuts in spring and rice in summer. This type of field has 1,750 mu, accounting for about one-third of the total arable land, with a large quantity and great potential, and is the focus of reform. The method of reform is to increase the planting of one season of winter sweet potatoes after the late rice is harvested. In order to ensure that planting peanuts in the spring is not delayed after the sweet potatoes are harvested, they advanced the planting and harvesting periods of sweet potatoes and their previous crop, late rice, by one solar term compared to the past.
    The third category is sandy "hope-for-rain" fields, which are prone to drought. This type of field totals 1,040 mu, generally planting one season of late rice, combined with one season of summer miscellaneous grains or winter sweet potatoes. The method of reforming this type of field is to level the land, build channels, increase drainage and irrigation equipment, and develop water sources. After a year of effort last year, mechanized irrigation was achieved. This year, more than 500 mu of peanuts and more than 400 mu of summer miscellaneous grains were planted on this part of the sandy fields of more than 1,000 mu that had been left idle in the summer for many years.
    The fourth category of fields has 455 mu, generally planting one season of summer miscellaneous grains or peanuts, autumn fallow for four months, and then planting sweet potatoes in winter. For this type of field, the habit of autumn fallow was also changed, and one season of late rice or autumn peanuts was added.
    The fifth category of fields is yellow clay viscous fields, totaling 800 mu. In the early spring and winter dry seasons, the soil is very hard. In the past, it was generally watered and soaked in the summer, planting only one season of late rice. The method for this type of field is to build water conservancy projects to ensure that it can be irrigated with water all year round, and at the same time apply 60 dan of sandy soil per mu to loosen the soil, so that another season of early rice can be planted.
    After these reforms, the multiple cropping area was expanded by more than 3,000 mu, including an expansion of the winter sweet potato area by 1,100 mu, the early rice area by 457 mu, the late rice area by 760 mu, the spring peanut area by 525 mu, the autumn peanut area by 200 mu, and the summer miscellaneous grain area by 499 mu.
    While expanding the multiple cropping index, great efforts were made to grasp crop rotation and expand fertilizer sources. The Milang Brigade implemented a large-scale rice and peanut rotation system, planning a three-year rotation cycle. Using peanut rotation to improve the soil, and using rice fields to grow peanuts, rotating new land to promote high peanut yields, achieving a double win. In order to expand the source of fertilizer, with the consent of the purchasing department, the team set up its own oil press to extract oil, selling peanut oil to the state and leaving peanut cakes as fertilizer for farmland. This year, a total of 230,000 jin of peanut cakes were obtained, solving the topdressing problem for all late rice fields. All peanut seedlings were returned to the fields as base fertilizer, with one mu of seedlings used as base fertilizer for two mu of rice fields, making rice fertilizer more sufficient than in any previous year, bringing about a significant increase in late rice production.
    In order to study a new set of farming systems, the cadres of this brigade conducted more than two years of experiments and in-depth summaries of the experience of the masses. For example, the issue of planting another crop of winter sweet potatoes on peanut fields was repeatedly tested and explored, and a very reliable conclusion was reached before it was affirmed and promoted. In 1958, it was learned that the original Fourth Advanced Cooperative had planted winter sweet potatoes in the pre-season of spring peanut fields in the winter of 1957. As a result, not only was another crop of sweet potatoes harvested, but also peanut production increased by 20%. In order to further confirm this issue, Pan Yiyan, a member of the commune party committee, and Pan Xuecai, the party branch secretary, personally conducted 16 mu of experimental fields in 1958. Eight mu of peanut fields were planted with winter sweet potatoes, and eight mu were left idle for the winter. These 16 mu of land were fertilized with the same amount of fertilizer and managed in the same way. As a result of the harvest, the former yielded 82 jin more peanuts per mu than the latter. This affirmed the benefits of planting sweet potatoes in peanut fields. However, where is the scientific basis? Without a scientific basis, it would be very dangerous if anything changes in the planting process in the future without knowing how to deal with it. So they went to consult the technical cadres from the Peanut Research Institute of the Academy of Sciences stationed in the county. They searched through the books but could not find a definite and reliable basis. So everyone went to the fields to test the soil, and then they understood the reason: it turned out that planting sweet potatoes in peanut fields, and immediately planting peanuts after digging up the potatoes in spring, the moisture level of the soil is most suitable for peanut seeds to germinate and take root, promoting early growth and development; on the other hand, planting winter sweet potatoes will break the soil and ridge it over the winter, which will weather the soil more deeply and thoroughly than leaving the white fields idle over the winter, and have a better aggregate structure, which is the main reason for promoting peanut production.
    After clarifying the reason, the reform plan was handed over to the masses for discussion, and the masses raised another difficult problem: they said that planting sweet potatoes in peanut fields requires harvesting the winter sweet potatoes 20 days earlier, otherwise it will delay the peanut planting period. And harvesting winter sweet potatoes early means that the growing period is not enough, the yield is very low, and it is not worth it. How to solve this contradiction and achieve the best of both worlds? So they mobilized the masses again to offer suggestions, and everyone thought of many ways. Finally, everyone unanimously agreed to plant the late rice in the peanut fields one solar term earlier and harvest it one solar term earlier, so that the winter sweet potatoes could also be planted earlier and harvested earlier. The winter sweet potatoes had enough growing period, the yield was not affected, and the peanuts could be planted on time, and the contradiction was resolved.
    Various farming system reform experiments were carried out on a larger area on the basis of successful small-area experiments. For example, in the experiment of changing single-cropping to three-cropping, the cadres selected 300 mu of single-cropping fields known as "Wan Shi Shou Dong" by the masses for experiments. They were planted in a cycle according to the planting formula of peanut-rice-winter sweet potato for two years. Not only was one crop turned into three crops successfully, but also because of the additional planting of sweet potatoes and peanuts, the organic matter in the soil greatly increased, changing from barren to fertile, and backward fields became advanced fields. "Wan Shi Shou Dong" is the worst field in the entire team. Its successful reform has convinced the masses of the reform of other fields with better conditions.

    名副其实的米粮队
    ——记米粮大队耕作制度改革的胜利
    本报记者　黄越  通讯员　黄先田
    广东电白县坡心公社米粮大队，今年由于因地制宜、积极稳妥地改革耕作制度，扩大复种指数，实行粮油作物的合理轮种制，使各项作物获得增产，由一贯缺粮变为有余粮，今年平均每人向国家提供商品粮一百九十斤，花生油二十五斤。
    米粮大队在广东西部亚热带的丘陵地区，土质不大好，容易受旱；全队有五千二百九十六口人，只有五千二百四十五亩耕地。地少人多，打的粮食不够吃，过去是一个有名的穷地方，但这里的人却给这个地方取了一个吉利的名字，叫做“米粮乡”，表现出他们的愿望。名字虽然早就取了，但真正成为名副其实的“米粮乡”，还是近几年的事。
    米粮大队人多地少，按说是应该充分利用地力，使它长出更多的粮食来。但过去因受生产力落后的限制，长期因袭下来的一套落后耕作制度很少改变。例如在1958年公社化以前，全队一年种三季的土地不足四分之一，大部分田都只种两季或一季。米粮大队的干部和群众，在县委和公社党委的领导下，有计划、有步骤地进行了耕作制度的改革。改革的主要内容，是变一年两熟为三熟，水稻、甘薯、花生实行合理的倒茬轮作。
    在耕作制度的改革中，队干部深入实际，深入群众，对全社的土地进行了调查分析，摸清了各种不同的土质和自然条件。根据不同的土地，采取了适当的对策。
    根据干部、群众对全队的耕地调查分析的结果，全队的耕地分为五类：
    第一类，土质肥，水利条件好，春夏两季种水稻，冬季种甘薯。这类田共一千二百亩，使用比较合理，基本上照原来的种法不变。
    第二类，土质和水利条件较第一类稍差，一年种两季，春季种花生，夏季种水稻。这类田有一千七百五十亩，约占全部耕地的三分之一，数量多，潜力大，作为改革的重点。改的办法是，在收晚稻后，增种一季冬甘薯。为了使甘薯收后不误春季种花生，他们把甘薯及其前茬作物晚稻的种、收期都较过去提前一个节令。
    第三类是沙质较大的望天田，容易受旱。这类田共有一千零四十亩，一般是种一季晚稻，兼种一季夏杂粮或冬甘薯。改革这类田的办法是，平整土地，兴修渠道，增加排灌设备，开辟水源。经过去年一年的努力，实现了机械化灌溉。今年就把这部分历年夏季休闲的一千多亩沙质田，种了五百多亩花生和四百多亩夏杂粮。
    第四类田有四百五十五亩，一般是种一季夏杂粮或花生，秋季休闲四个月，冬季再种甘薯。对这类田也改变了秋季休闲的习惯，增种一季晚稻或秋花生。
    第五类田是黄泥粘质田，共八百亩，早春和冬季缺雨季节，泥土十分坚硬，过去一般是夏季蓄水浸田，只种一季晚稻。对这类田的办法是，兴修水利，使其长年得水灌溉，同时每亩铺施沙土六十担，疏松土壤，能够多种一季早稻。
    经过这些改革后，共扩大复种面积三千多亩，其中扩大冬薯面积一千一百亩，早稻面积四百五十七亩，晚稻面积七百六十亩，春花生面积五百二十五亩，秋花生面积二百亩，夏杂粮面积四百九十九亩。
    在扩大复种指数的同时，大力抓好轮种和扩大肥料来源。米粮大队实行了大面积的水稻与花生的轮种制，计划三年为一个轮作周期。利用花生轮换土地改良土壤，利用稻田种花生，轮换新地，促进花生高产，做到一举两得。为了扩大肥源，征得收购部门的同意，队里自设榨油厂榨油，卖花生油给国家，留下花生饼作农田肥料。今年共得花生饼二十三万斤，解决了全部晚稻田的追肥问题。花生苗全部回田作基肥，一亩苗充作两亩稻田的基肥，使水稻肥料比过去任何一年都充足，带来了晚稻的显著增产。
    为了研究出一套新的耕作制度，这个大队的干部进行了为期两年多的试验和深入总结群众经验的工作。例如对花生地多种一造冬薯的问题，就进行了多次试验和探讨，得出十分可靠的结论，才肯定下来加以推广。 1958年，了解到原来的第四高级社曾在1957年冬季在春花生地的前季种了冬薯。结果，不但多收一造甘薯，花生也增产20％。为了进一步证实这个问题，公社党委委员潘毅炎和党支部书记潘学才，在1958年亲自搞了十六亩试验田。其中八亩花生地种上冬薯，八亩休闲过冬，这十六亩地施同样多的肥，同样的管理方法，收获结果，前者比后者每亩多收花生八十二斤。这一来，花生地种甘薯的好处肯定了。可是，科学根据在哪里呢？找不出科学根据，万一将来种植过程中发生什么变化，不懂得处理，是很危险的。于是他们又去请教科学院花生研究所派驻本县的技术干部。他们翻遍了书本也找不到确切可靠的根据。于是大家到田里化验土壤，才弄明白了其中的道理：原来花生地种过甘薯，春天挖了薯后马上播花生，土壤的湿润程度最适合花生种子发芽生根，促进前期生长发育；另方面，种冬薯将泥土打碎起畦过冬，比白田休闲过冬土壤风化深透，有了更好的团粒结构，这是促进花生增产的主要原因。
    道理弄清楚了，将改革方案交给群众讨论，群众又提出一个难题：他们说，花生地种甘薯，冬薯必须提早二十天收获，否则就会迟误花生的播种期。而冬薯收获提早，生长期不够，产量很低，不上算。怎样解决这个矛盾，达到两全其美呢？于是他们又来发动群众献计，大家想了许多办法。最后大家一致同意将花生地的晚稻提早一个节令种植，提早一个节令收获，冬薯也可以提早种提早收，冬薯有了足够的生长期，产量不受影响，花生也可以按时种下，矛盾就解决了。
    各项耕作制的改革试验，在小面积试验成功的基础上，又进行较大面积的试验。例如，把单造改三造的试验，干部选了群众称为“万世瘦垌”的三百亩单造田进行试验，按花生——水稻——冬薯，这个种植公式循环种植了两年，不但一造种三造成功，而且由于多种了一造甘薯、花生，土壤的有机质大大增加，由瘦变肥，落后田变了先进田。“万世瘦垌”是全队最差的田，它能改革成功，对其他条件较好的田的改革，群众就深信不疑了。
