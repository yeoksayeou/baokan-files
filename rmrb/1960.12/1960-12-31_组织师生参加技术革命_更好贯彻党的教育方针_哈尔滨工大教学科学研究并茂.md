Harbin Institute of Technology organizes teachers and students to participate in the technical revolution to better implement the Party's education policy, integrating teaching and scientific research.

(Reported by our newspaper) Harbin Institute of Technology insists on continuously organizing teachers and students to participate in the technical revolution movement, further implementing the Party's education policy, improving the quality of teaching, and promoting scientific research.

Over the past year, the school has regularly and systematically sent teachers and students of relevant majors to factories to work, study, and solve key production problems in the technical revolution movement together with workers and technicians. In the spring of this year alone, during the upsurge of the mechanization and automation movement, the school organized more than 4,000 teachers and students to cooperate with more than 200 factories in Harbin, completing 612 mechanization and automation projects, including participating in the design and manufacture of 118 automatic lines and 444 automated workshops, significantly increasing labor productivity. Teachers and students majoring in industrial electrification helped the Jincheng Hardware Factory further realize "remote control" on the basis of realizing the mechanization of manual operations, reducing the number of workers in a workshop from more than 40 to only two. Since this spring, teachers and students have been regularly and systematically participating in the technical revolution movement in factories. Since the beginning of this semester, teachers and students have been participating in the technical revolution movement in batches and stages, combining teaching, scientific research, and productive labor. Relevant majors have also participated in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement of agricultural machinery. In response to the urgent needs of agricultural production, teachers and students have improved and designed agricultural machinery such as combined threshers, harvesters, bean threshers, and winnowing machines. An automatic universal integrated thresher designed and manufactured by them with the assistance of the Shuangcheng County Farm Tool Factory can directly thresh corn, sorghum, soybeans, or millet as long as the crops are placed on the conveyor belt.

Many of the research results of the school's teachers and students participating in the technical revolution movement have been developed from point to area, forming complete sets, and even promoting the revolution of the entire technical field of some disciplines. Since the workers of the Harbin Machinery Factory created the "using small to do big" building block-style machine tools in the winter of 1958, the school, according to the instructions of the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, sent a large number of teachers and students majoring in machine tools to summarize and analyze various building block-style machine tools and completed the structural finalization design of building block-style machine tools. Over the past two years, in cooperation with factories, they have successively designed large building block-style machine tools with "three modernizations" (multi-purpose, automated movement, and universal parts) and "four degrees" (high rigidity, high precision, reasonable tool angles, and reasonable cutting speeds), medium-sized building block-style machine tools for small and medium-sized factories, small building block-style machine tools for rural machinery factories and repair stations, and "small-small" building block-style machine tools that can be moved anywhere and repaired on the spot, equivalent to a "mobile repair station." They are now designing and manufacturing building block-style machine tools to replace general machine tools and precision special machine tools.

When organizing teachers and students to participate in the technical revolution movement, the school pays great attention to arranging research work according to teaching needs. They use the technical key points in the technical revolution movement as topics for students' course design and graduation design. Because the students participated in a complete series of processes from resource surveying, scheme selection, product design to manufacturing, installation, operation, and even further improvement of the design, they not only fundamentally changed the "armchair strategy" situation of the past design, but also made the students receive comprehensive training, thereby improving the quality of the design. About 40% of the course designs made by fourth-year students majoring in machine tools and automation in the technical revolution movement have reached or exceeded the level of previous fifth-year students' graduation designs. Judging from the content of this year's graduation design, most of them are things that students could only do two or three years after graduating from university in the past. A series of ultra-high voltage electrical appliances such as 330,000-volt current transformers, compressed air circuit breakers, and isolating switches designed and manufactured by the students of Class 55 of the Electrical Appliances Department in cooperation with the factory are of great value. A complete set of simple machine tools for rural use designed by the graduates majoring in machine tools in cooperation with the Machine Tool Research Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building has been included in the national machine tool catalog, and some of the products have also participated in the exhibition at the 16th Casablanca International Exposition.

The school also broke the superstition that "you can't participate in the technical revolution without learning professional courses" and widely organized lower-grade students to go to factories together. Before going to the factory and during the work process, lectures are given in a planned manner, on-site teaching is carried out, and workers and technicians are organized to give lectures to continuously carry out technical disclosure, which has improved their knowledge level. With the help of teachers and workers, the third-year students of the Electrical Engineering Department quickly mastered the design principles and design methods of the electrical control circuit and remote control circuit of the automatic production line, which could only be learned by fifth-year students in the past.

Since this year, after participating in the technical revolution movement, teachers and students have written more than 3.4 million words of scientific papers and monographs focusing on mechanization and automation, which is four times more than last year. Many papers have received attention and welcome from relevant departments.

    组织师生参加技术革命  更好贯彻党的教育方针
    哈尔滨工大教学科学研究并茂
    本报讯　哈尔滨工业大学坚持不断地组织师生参加技术革命运动，进一步贯彻执行党的教育方针，提高了教学质量，推动了科学研究工作。
    一年来，这所学校经常有计划地派有关专业师生到各工厂中去同工人、技术人员一起，同劳动，共研究，解决技术革命运动中的生产关键问题。仅在今年春天机械化自动化运动的高潮中，学校就组织了四千多名师生同哈尔滨市二百多个工厂合作，完成了六百一十二个机械化自动化项目，其中包括参加设计和制造了一百一十八条自动线、四百四十四个自动化车间，显著地提高了劳动生产率。工业企业电气化专业师生帮助金城五金厂在实现了手工操作机械化的基础上，进一步实现了“遥控”，使一个原来有四十多名工人的车间，减少到两名工人就能进行操作。从今年春季起，广大师生下厂参加技术革命运动已做到经常化、制度化。本学期以来，学校师生结合教学、科学研究和生产劳动，分批分期地投入了技术革命运动，有关专业还参加了农业机具的技术革新和技术革命运动。师生针对农业生产的迫切需要，曾改进和设计了联合脱谷机、收割机、打豆机、扬场机等农业机械。他们帮助双城县农具厂设计制造的一台自动万能综合脱谷机，只要将农作物放到传送带上，不论是苞米、高粱、大豆还是谷子，都可直接脱粒。
    这个学校的师生参加技术革命运动的研究成果，有不少是从点到面，配套成龙，甚至促进了某些学科的整个技术领域的革命。从1958年冬哈尔滨机械厂的工人创造出“以小干大”的积木式机床开始，学校就根据中共哈尔滨市委的指示，派出机床专业的大批师生对各种积木式机床进行了总结分析，完成了积木式机床的结构定型设计。两年来，他们和工厂合作，先后设计出了“三化”（用途多能化、运动自动化、部件通用化）“四度”（高钢度、高精度、合理刀具角度、合理切削速度）大型积木式机床、用于中小型工厂的中型积木式机床、用于农村机械厂和修配站的小型积木式机床以及可以随处搬动、就地修理相当于一个“活动修配站”的“小小型”积木式机床。现在他们正在设计和制造代替一般机床和精密特种机床的积木式机床。
    学校在组织师生参加技术革命的运动时，十分注意按照教学需求来安排研究工作。他们以技术革命运动中的技术关键为题目，安排学生的课程设计和毕业设计。由于学生们参加了从资源勘测、方案选择、产品设计到制造、安装、运行甚至到进一步改进设计的一系列完整的过程，不仅根本改变了过去设计时的“纸上谈兵”状况，而且使学生受到了全面锻炼，从而提高了设计质量。机床及自动化专业四年级学生在技术革命运动中所作出的课程设计，有40％左右已达到或超过了以往五年级学生的毕业设计水平。从今年的毕业设计的内容来看，大都是过去学生在大学毕业两三年后才能做到的。电器五十五班在学生同工厂合作设计和制造的三十三万伏电流互感器、压缩空气断路器及隔离开关等一系列的超高压电器，都有重大价值。机床专业毕业生与第一机械工业部机床研究所合作设计出的一整套农村用简式机床，已被列入国家机床型谱，其中部分产品并且参加了十六届卡萨布兰卡国际博览会的展出。
    这个学校还破除了“没学专业课不能参加技术革命”的迷信，广泛组织低年级学生一同下厂。在下厂之前和工作过程中，有计划地讲课、进行现场教学、组织工人和技术人员开讲座，不断地进行技术交底。提高了他们的知识水平。电机系三年级的学生，在教师、工人的帮助下，边干边学，很快就掌握了过去五年级学生才能学到的生产自动线电气控制线路，遥控线路的设计原理和设计方法。
    今年以来，师生们参加技术革命运动后，共写出了以机械化自动化为中心的科学论文、专著三百四十多万字，比去年多了四倍。许多论文都受到有关部门的重视和欢迎。
