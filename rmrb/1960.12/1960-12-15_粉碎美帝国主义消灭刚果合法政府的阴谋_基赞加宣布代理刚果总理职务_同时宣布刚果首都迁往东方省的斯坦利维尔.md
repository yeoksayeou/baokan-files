      粉碎美帝国主义消灭刚果合法政府的阴谋
      基赞加宣布代理刚果总理职务
      同时宣布刚果首都迁往东方省的斯坦利维尔
      新华社14日讯　斯坦利维尔消息：刚果共和国合法政府副总理基赞加13日在斯坦利维尔宣布，在卢蒙巴总理被绑架期间，他代理刚果总理的职务。
    基赞加还宣布，把刚果首都从目前为帝国主义支持下的蒙博托叛国集团所窃据的利奥波德维尔迁往东方省的斯坦利维尔。
    据报道，基赞加已经把刚果政府上述决定通知了联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德和安全理事会主席。
    卢蒙巴总理是12月1日在从利奥波德维尔去斯坦利维尔途中被帝国主义走狗蒙博托武装绑架的。现在他被这个叛国集团非法监禁在下刚果的太斯维尔，受着非人的待遇。
