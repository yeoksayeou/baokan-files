"The world capitalist system is in a process of profound decline and disintegration." "The instability of the capitalist economy is growing. Despite a certain degree of production growth in some capitalist countries, contradictions of capitalism, whether domestically or internationally, are constantly intensifying."

    “世界资本主义体系处在一个深刻的衰落和瓦解的过程中。”“资本主义经济的不稳定性在增长着。尽管某些资本主义国家的生产在或多或少的程度上有一定的增长，但是，资本主义的矛盾无论在本国或国际范围内，都在不断地尖锐化。”
