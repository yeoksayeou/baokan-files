Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan Electric Dispatch: Daye Iron Mine of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation is vigorously grasping the production preparation work for the first quarter of next year.

At the beginning of the fourth quarter of this year, Daye Iron Mine began to prepare for the first quarter of next year from the stripping aspect. At present, it has stockpiled a large amount of recoverable ore, preparing a source of ore for steel production in the first quarter of next year. Since entering December, the Party committee of Daye Iron Mine has also formulated preliminary plans for mining, spare parts processing, equipment maintenance, raw material supply, technical measures, and labor organization for next year. They specially formed two professional groups to lead the processing and manufacturing of spare parts and the supply of raw materials. The materials with the largest demand in the entire mine, such as explosives, detonators, and fuses, can basically meet the needs of production in the first quarter of next year, and there has also been some preparation for flotation reagents used in mineral processing; other items such as iron balls, screws, lime, water glass, and labor protection supplies have also been arranged accordingly. In order to solve the spare parts needed for next year's production, an electric furnace in the mine has begun to produce all steel for spare parts. The metalworking workshop is using this steel to rush-produce large parts such as crawler plates, shovel rods, and turbine housings for electric shovels. Based on the characteristics of the mine area's work extending outwards and the sharp increase in transportation volume within the mine next year, the transportation department employees are also actively carrying out overall transformation of the entire mine's transportation lines, tapping transportation potential. In the Jianshan working area, where the transportation volume of the entire mine will increase the most next year, the reconstruction project of the transportation line has been completed by 60% so far.

    大冶铁矿已储备大量回采矿量
    据新华社武汉电  武汉钢铁公司大冶铁矿大抓明年第一季度的生产准备工作。
    大冶铁矿在今年第四季度之初，就开始从剥离方面为明年第一季度进行准备，目前已储备了大量的回采矿量，为明年第一季度钢铁生产准备了矿源。进入12月以来，大冶铁矿党委又制订了明年的采掘、备品配件加工、设备检修、原料材料供应和技术措施、劳动组织等初步方案。他们特地组成了两个专业组，领导备品配件的加工制造和原料材料的供应工作。全矿需要量最大的材料如炸药、雷管、导火线等，已可以基本上满足明年第一季度生产的需要，选矿用的浮选药剂也有了一定的准备；其他如铁球、螺丝、石灰、水玻璃、劳动保护用品等，也都分别作了安排。为了解决明年生产所需的备品配件，矿里的一座电炉已经开始全部生产配件用钢。金工车间正用这种钢赶制电铲的履带板、铲杆、涡轮外壳等大型配件。根据明年矿区工作面向外延伸，矿内运输量急剧增长的特点，运输部门职工也积极对全矿运输线路实行总体改造，挖掘运输潜力。明年全矿运量增长幅度最大的尖山工区，到目前为止，运输线路的改建工程已经完成60％。
