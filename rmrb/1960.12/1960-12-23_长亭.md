    Long Pavilion
    By Dù Ruòxiāng

    At the Fuchun River ferry crossing there is a long pavilion. In the Jiangnan region, these long pavilions are common, and they can bring a sense of warmth to travelers.

    It was the middle of the day, and there weren't many travelers. An old woman, probably returning from visiting her daughter in the city, kept examining a pair of new cloth shoes she was bringing back; two young men, similarly dressed in gray cloth trousers but wearing white shirts, their shirt pockets bulging with small notebooks, and carrying umbrellas behind them, were probably rushing back to their brigade after a meeting in the commune.

    However, the ferry had not yet arrived.

    The people in the long pavilion were drawn in by a burst of laughter. Looking up, they saw a young woman carrying a shoulder pole walking towards the long pavilion. She held the pole with one hand and gestured with the other. At the front of the pole was a large wicker basket, its contents unknown, half-covered with floral cloth; at the back was a roll of luggage and a net bag. She spoke as she walked, laughing continuously.

    "Almost there, almost there! ... Oh, look, look, we're almost home! ..."

    The clear accent and hearty laughter made it seem like a large group was approaching, but she was the only one on the road. There wasn't another soul in sight.

    As she spoke, she entered the long pavilion, put down the pole, wiped her sweat with the towel around her neck, and removed the floral cloth covering the wicker basket.

    The people in the long pavilion all exclaimed "Ha!" and laughed: sitting in the wicker basket was a chubby little boy of about two years old.

    The child, suddenly the center of attention, became so nervous that he was on the verge of crying. His mother sensed his feelings and quickly picked him up from the wicker basket, lifting him high with both hands. Then, holding the child with one hand, she pointed to the opposite bank:

      "Don't cry. Oh dear, what are you crying for, really! ... Once we cross the river, we'll be home soon. ... Look, our home is so nice! You silly boy!"

    Having said that, she kissed the child's little face.

    Whether he really understood his mother's words, or was attracted by the clumps of tall tallow trees on the opposite bank and the two geese in the river, the child indeed stopped crying. His little eyes fixed on the white geese, and he giggled.

    The mother breathed a sigh of relief. She smoothed her hair, which had been ruffled by the wind, glanced around the long pavilion, and expertly asked the two young men:

    "Comrades, which brigade are you from?"

    The two young men answered almost simultaneously: "Qingshan Brigade."

    "Ha, what a coincidence. I'm returning to Qingshan Brigade."

    "You are...?"

    "Returning from the province. I've been away from home for almost five years. I've missed it so much, now everything is fine..."

    One of the young men eagerly asked: "How many of you are coming down?"

    "Twelve. The commune has made unified allocations, three to Willow Lake, six to Yangqiao, saying it's a backward team that needs to be strengthened. The rest are all going to Qingshan. You see, I've brought the little one back too."

    The two young men didn't know how to respond for a moment, and hurriedly said with a smile: "Welcome, welcome!"

    The young mother was even happier, and kissed the child again, pointing and saying: "Look, uncles are welcoming us! ... Oh, oh, uncles are welcoming us!"

    One of the young men finally recognized the new commune member.

    "Are you Sister Huang Zhen? The more I look, the more you seem like her. I was thinking for a long time."

    The person called Sister Huang Zhen laughed. Before she could ask a question, the other young man continued: "Yes, Comrade Huang Zhen. You were transferred to work in Hangzhou a while ago, and haven't been back since, right?"

    At this moment, the ferry docked. The people in the long pavilion stood up and headed towards the ferry, chatting and laughing.

    "Here, let us hold the child, it's tiring to carry," one of the young men said quickly, taking the child from Huang Zhen's hands. The other young man busied himself helping the old woman onto the gangplank.

    The ferry, carrying a boatload of people and a boatload of laughter, slowly sailed to the middle of the river. The laughter of those three Qingshan people spread lightly across the water, so warm and so touching. The female comrade kept asking this and that, as if she wanted to ask about all the people and all the events in the entire brigade at once, no longer bothering to coax the child.

    长亭
    杜若湘
    富春江渡口有个长亭。在江南，这种长亭是常见的，它能给行路人带来一阵亲切的温暖。
    正是晌午时分，行人并不多。一位老婆婆，大约从城里看女儿回来，不住地端详着带回来的一双新布鞋；两个青年人，差不多的装束，灰布裤子，上面却穿着白衬衫，衬衫口袋被小本子鼓得满满的，身后都背把雨伞，大约是在公社里刚开完会赶回大队去。
    然而渡船还没有过来。
    长亭里的人被一阵说笑声吸引住了。抬头一看，从通到长亭来的路上，走过来一位挑着一副担子的年青妇女，她一只手扶着扁担，另一只手不停地指划。担子的前头是一只大藤篮，不知装着什么，还用花布遮住一半；后头是一只行李卷和一只网袋。她边走边说着话，又不住地笑着。
    “到了，快到了！……哦，你看，你快看呀，咱们回到家罗！……”
    那清脆的口音和爽朗的笑声，就像来了一大伙人，可是路上却只有她一个。周围连一个人影也不见。
    说话之间，她走进长亭，放下担子，用脖子上的手巾擦一下汗，就揭掉罩在藤篮上的花布。
    长亭里的人不约而同地“哈”的一声笑起来：藤篮里坐着一个两岁左右的小胖男孩。
    孩子一下子被许多人注视，紧张得几乎要哭了。妈妈体会到儿子的心情，连忙把他从藤篮里抱起来，双手一使劲，举得高高的。然后，一手托着孩子，一手指着对岸：
      “别哭。哎哟，哭什么呀，你真是！……一过了河，就快到家了。……你瞧，咱们家有多好啊！你这傻小子！”
    说罢，她亲了一下孩子的小脸蛋。
    不知是真的听懂了妈妈的话，还是被河对岸的一丛丛高大的乌桕树和河里的两只鹅吸引住，孩子果然不哭了。两只小眼，盯住了白鹅，格格地笑起来。
    妈妈这才松口气。她拢了一下被风吹乱了的头发，向长亭里扫视了一下，有经验地问那两个青年：
    “同志，你们是哪个大队的？”
    两个青年几乎同时回答：“青山大队。”
    “哈，巧极了。我就是回青山大队。”
    “你是……？”
    “从省里回来的。我离开家都快五年了。真是想死人，现在可好了……”
    有一位青年急切地问：“你们下来几个？”
    “十二。公社统一分配，三个到柳湖，六个洋桥，说那是个落后队，要加强力量。其余的都到青山。你们看，我把小家伙也带回来了。”
    两个青年一时不知怎么回答，连忙笑着说：“欢迎，欢迎！”
    年青的妈妈更乐了，又亲了孩子一下，指着说：“你瞧，叔叔来欢迎咱们啦！……哦，哦，叔叔来欢迎咱们罗！”
    有一个青年终于把这位新来的社员认出来了。
    “你是黄珍姐吧？我越看越像，想了半天。”
    被唤作黄珍姐的人笑了起来，还没等她反问，另一个青年就接着说：“是呀，黄珍同志。你打上回调到杭州去工作，一直没有回来过吧？”
    这时候，渡船靠岸了。长亭里的人一面说笑着，一面站起来走向渡口。
    “来，孩子给我们抱吧，挑着多累。”两个青年人中的一个抢着说，顺手从黄珍手里接过孩子。另一个青年就忙着搀那位老婆婆走上跳板。
    渡船载着一船人，一船笑语，缓缓地划到河心。那三位青山人的说笑声，在河面上轻盈地传开，那么亲切，又那么动人。那位女同志不住地问这问那，仿佛一下子要把全大队的人、全大队的事都问完，再也顾不上哄孩子了。
