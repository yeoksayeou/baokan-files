Chairman Liu Shaoqi's Speech

Your Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk, esteemed Cambodian guests, friends, comrades:

Now, His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk and the esteemed Cambodian guests are about to leave Beijing to visit other parts of our country. With a feeling of reluctance to part, I am here to bid farewell to our good friend His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk and His Excellency Vice-Chairman Penn Nouth, His Excellency Prime Minister Pho Proeung, His Excellency Deputy Prime Minister Nhiek Tioulong, and other Cambodian guests who are accompanying the Prince on his visit to our country. At this moment of imminent departure, please allow me, on behalf of our country and people, and in my own name, to express my sincere gratitude and respect to His Royal Highness for his valuable contribution to strengthening Sino-Cambodian friendship.

This visit by His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk has written a new page in the history of friendly relations between China and Cambodia. During the visit, the leaders of our two countries held many friendly contacts and cordial talks, and extensively and frankly exchanged views on further strengthening friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries and on issues of common concern to both countries. Yesterday, our two governments concluded the Sino-Cambodian Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression. This is a major event in the relations between our two countries and a major event in the political life of the people of our two countries. Your Royal Highness, this shows that both sides have firm confidence and determination to realize the common aspiration that China and Cambodia must always live in harmony and cooperate in a friendly manner; the people of China and Cambodia must always be as close as brothers and share weal and woe. Let our two governments and peoples work together, help each other, build our respective countries better and faster, and continuously achieve new victories in the cause of safeguarding national independence and defending world peace.

Your Royal Highness, esteemed Cambodian guests, during your short stay of a few days, you have already seen how deep the feelings of our people are for the brotherly Cambodian people and how high the respect for Your Royal Highness. The deep friendship of the Cambodian people that you have brought will forever remain in the hearts of the 650 million Chinese people. No force in the world can undermine the friendship between our two peoples, and no force can stop our two peoples from advancing together.

I wish His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk and all the Cambodian guests good health and a safe journey.
