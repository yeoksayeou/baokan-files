The Qi Hezhi Youth Rapid Excavation Team of Chenjiazhuang Mine of the Hebi Mining Bureau of Henan Province has mastered the internal laws of the excavation production process. Using the method of concentrating forces to fight annihilation battles, it has vigorously carried out technological revolution and created a set of advanced excavation experiences and mechanization methods. It has continuously and significantly improved excavation labor productivity to ensure the needs of coal mining production. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, they have always held high the Leap Forward red flag, increasing the monthly efficiency of single-hole coal roadway excavation from 54 meters to more than 2,100 meters. In the first ten months of this year, they excavated more than 18,600 meters. According to the quota calculation, they are now doing the work of 1964.

The experience created by the Qi Hezhi Excavation Team is pushing China's coal roadway excavation technology to a new peak. Many units across the country have learned from their experience and created new excavation records. For example, in Henan Province, five excavation teams have continuously achieved monthly advances of more than 2,000 meters for several months.

The Qi Hezhi Excavation Team was established at the end of 1957. In the early days of its establishment, it failed to complete the state plan for three consecutive months. The emergence of the situation of the Great Leap Forward in national industrial and agricultural production greatly inspired Qi Hezhi, the leader of the excavation team and a Communist Party member. He realized that if the excavation efficiency was not improved, not only would he not be able to leap forward, but it would also affect the leap forward in coal mining and the leap forward in the entire coal production. Therefore, he and the deputy leader Zhao Shengxue carefully analyzed the situation in the team and believed that the low labor efficiency was mainly due to the large number of new workers (more than 80%). New workers were not yet accustomed to underground labor and had not established the idea of "taking the mine as their home," and their skills were not proficient. In response to this situation, they organized all the old and new workers in the team to sign apprenticeship contracts, with the old workers contracting the political ideology, technical education, and living arrangements of the new workers. This quickly helped the new workers improve their awareness and technical level; in addition, the establishment of a production method of division of labor, contracting, special person in charge, and mutual guarantee in every link quickly improved excavation efficiency.

At this time, the Hebi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward a call to the Hebi Mining Bureau to learn from and catch up with advanced mining bureaus. At that time, the Wang Jinsheng excavation team of Jiaozuo Mining Bureau achieved a monthly efficiency of more than 400 meters and was a nationally renowned advanced team. The Qi Hezhi Excavation Team decided to take the Wang Jinsheng team as its target to catch up with. They believed that achievements are all made through hard work, and what the Wang Jinsheng team can do, we can definitely do! In order to catch up with the Wang Jinsheng team, they carefully analyzed the excavation production process, mastered its laws, and found that the key to improving excavation efficiency lies in two links: drilling and blasting and underground transportation. Therefore, they first concentrated their efforts on carrying out technical revolution in drilling and blasting, and finally created blasting methods such as the "pentagram" and the "four-door bucket," which greatly improved blasting efficiency and created a new record of 524 meters per month. After the blasting efficiency was improved, underground transportation became an obstacle to the continued improvement of excavation efficiency. They then seized the transportation link to vigorously carry out technical revolution, creating long-distance coal loading machines, etc., increasing the coal transportation efficiency of each shift from more than 30 tons to more than 80 tons.

After the coal loading machine was successfully created, they did not stop moving forward, but further carried out a technical revolution centered on realizing excavation mechanization. According to the characteristics of underground production, proceeding from realistic conditions, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and adopting various simple and easy-to-use methods, they developed the coal loading machine into six types of machinery, making excavation production basically realized fully mechanized production. In May of this year, they created a new record of 2,013.7 meters per month for single-hole coal roadway excavation. Later, they continued to improve and created the highest record of 2,118.6 meters per month, and saved about one-third of the labor force.

The Qi Hezhi Excavation Team not only continuously improves labor productivity through technological revolution, but also dares to pick up heavy burdens. After the increase production and conservation campaign centered on grain and steel began, Chenjiazhuang Mine decided to open up a new working face in order to produce more coal to support steel production. This task was originally undertaken by the Ren Fusheng Excavation Team. Due to the large cross-section of the working face, the large amount of gangue in the coal seam, and the level roadway excavation, only 140 meters were advanced in a month. Such progress could not guarantee that it would be put into production as planned. Seeing this situation, the Qi Hezhi Team took the initiative to ask the Party committee to take on this difficult task and contribute to socialist construction. When the Qi Hezhi Team arrived at the new working face, they encountered many difficulties at the beginning. The daily footage dropped from the original 80 meters to about 30 meters, and the coal loading machine was not easy to use; the long drill deep-hole blasting technology did not work here. However, the greater the difficulty, the greater their enthusiasm. The original set of mechanized equipment was no longer applicable, and they created a series coal loading machine suitable for level roadway excavation through a vigorous technical revolution. The drilling and blasting technology was changed to continuous blasting, which finally increased the daily efficiency to 50 meters and the monthly efficiency to more than 1,700 meters, creating the highest record of excavation under the same conditions in the country, and making the new working face transferred to production one month in advance.

The Qi Hezhi Excavation Team also proceeds from the overall interests in everything, and regards helping the backward catch up with and surpass themselves as a due obligation. When they were working hard to create a record of 2,000 meters per month in October of this year, they found that the Zhang Xiangcheng Team's task was not completed well. At this time, the leader Qi Hezhi did not hesitate to take a team to help the Zhang Xiangcheng Team, teach them advanced experience, and help them break through 1,000 meters in October and become an advanced team. Qi Hezhi had just returned to the team with his team when he heard that the excavation progress of their competitor, Guan Dexi Team, was very slow, so he went to help the Guan Dexi Team again, increasing the daily footage efficiency of the Guan Dexi Team from 40 meters to 100 meters, catching up with and surpassing their own excavation team.

Although the Qi Hezhi Excavation Team has made great achievements, it is never arrogant, but humbly learns from others. This year, they have sent people out more than ten times to learn more than 40 advanced experiences. The newly created "Three Firsts" blasting method is developed by concentrating the latest three blasting technologies in the country. (Attached picture)

    陈家庄煤矿齐合只掘进队掌握生产规律创造一套先进经验
    不断革新技术不断提高掘进效率
    勇于承担困难任务，善于帮助落后单位，虚心向别人学习
    本报讯　河南省鹤壁矿务局陈家庄矿齐合只青年快速掘进队，掌握掘进生产过程的内在规律，用集中兵力打歼灭战的方法，大搞技术革命，创造出一套先进掘进经验和机械化方法，不断地大幅度地提高掘进劳动生产率，保证采煤生产需要。从1958年大跃进以来，他们一直高举跃进红旗，把煤巷单孔掘进月效率由五十四米提高到了两千一百米以上。今年头十个月掘进了一万八千六百多米，按照定额计算，他们现在是在做1964年的活了。
    齐合只掘进队创造的经验，正在把我国煤巷掘进技术推向新高峰。全国许多单位学习了他们的经验以后，都创造出掘进新纪录。如河南省现在已有五个掘进队连续数月达到月进两千米以上。
    齐合只掘进队是1957年底成立的，建队之初，连续三个月没有完成国家计划。全国工农业生产大跃进的形势出现之后，极大地激励了掘进队长、共产党员齐合只。他认识到，掘进效率不提高，不只自己不能跃进，而且影响采煤的跃进和整个煤炭生产的跃进。于是他和副队长赵生学仔细地分析了队里的情况，认为劳动效率低的原因，主要是新工人多（80％以上），新工人还不太习惯井下劳动，没有树立起“以矿为家”的思想，同时技术也不熟练。针对这种情况，他们便组织全队的老工人和新工人签订了师徒合同，由老工人包干新工人的政治思想、技术教育和生活安排，很快就帮助新工人提高了觉悟和技术水平；加上建立了分工包干、专人负责、环环相保的生产办法，掘进效率很快有了提高。
    正在这时，中共鹤壁市委向鹤壁矿务局提出了学习、追赶先进矿务局的号召。当时，焦作矿务局的王金生掘进队月进效率达到四百米以上，是全国著名的先进队。齐合只掘进队就决定把王金生队作为自己的追赶对象。他们认为，成绩都是干出来的，王金生队能办到的，我们也一定能办到！为了赶上王金生队，他们认真地分析了掘进生产过程，掌握它的规律，发现提高掘进效率的关键在于打眼爆破和井下运输两个环节。于是便首先集中力量对打眼爆破进行技术革命，终于创造了“五角星”、“四门斗”等爆破方法，大大提高了爆破效率，创造出月进五百二十四米的新纪录。当爆破效率提高以后，井下运输又成为掘进效率继续提高的障碍。他们就又抓住运输这个环节大搞技术革命，创造了远距离扒煤机等，把每小班的运煤效率由三十多吨提高到八十多吨。
    扒煤机创造成功以后，他们并没有停止前进，而是进一步开展了以实现掘进机械化为中心的技术革命。他们根据井下生产的特点，从现实条件出发，土洋结合，采用各种简便易行的办法，把扒煤机发展成为六种机械，使掘进生产基本上实现了全面机械化生产。今年5月，他们创造了煤巷单孔掘进月进二千零十三点七米的新纪录。以后，又不断提高，创造了月进二千一百一十八点六米的最高纪录，并且节省了三分之一左右的劳动力。
    齐合只掘进队不仅通过技术革命不断提高劳动生产率，而且勇于拣重担子挑。以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动开始以后，陈家庄矿为了多产煤炭支援钢铁增产，决定新开拓一个工作面。这个任务原由任福生掘进队担任。由于工作面断面大，煤层中矸石多，又是平巷掘进，一个月只进了一百四十米。这样的进度，不能保证按计划投入生产。齐合只队看到这种情况，就主动向党委要求担负这个困难任务，为社会主义建设贡献力量。齐合只队到了新的工作面，开始困难重重，日进尺由原来的八十米降到三十米左右，扒煤机使用起来很不顺手；长钎打眼深孔爆破技术，在这里用起来也不灵了。但是，困难愈大，他们的干劲愈大。原有的一套机械化设备不适用了，他们又通过大闹技术革命，创造了适合平巷掘进的串连式扒煤机，打眼爆破技术改为放连珠炮，终于使日进效率提高到五十米，月进一千七百多米，创造了全国同样条件的掘进最高纪录，使新工作面提前一个月移交生产。
    齐合只掘进队还处处从整体利益出发，把帮助落后赶上和超过自己看成是应尽的义务。当今年10月他们为创造月进两千米纪录而努力的时候，发现张相成队任务完成得不够好，这时，队长齐合只毫不犹豫地带了一个小组去帮助张相成队，把先进经验教给他们，帮助他们在10月份突破了一千米，成为先进队。齐合只刚刚带着他的小组回到队里，听说他们的竞赛对手关德喜队的掘进进度很慢，便又去帮助关德喜队，使关德喜队的日进尺效率由四十米提高到一百米，赶上并超过了自己的掘进队。
    齐合只掘进队虽然创造了很大成绩，但从不骄傲，而是虚心向别人学习。今年他们就曾先后十几次派人出去学习了四十多项先进经验。他们新创造的“三先”爆破法，就是集中了全国最新的三项爆破技术发展而成的。（附图片）
