Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: TASS, New York - Soviet Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Zorin, held a press conference on the 21st to summarize the work of the first stage of the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly, which concluded on the 20th.

Zorin stated in a press conference statement that the issues submitted by the Soviet delegation, headed by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Khrushchev, for discussion at this session of the General Assembly, including the question of complete and thorough disarmament, the question of eradicating colonialism, the question of the situation in the Congo, and the question of restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, became the focus of the first stage of the session's work.

Zorin pointed out that the Soviet Union's actions were in line with the interests of all peace-loving countries and peoples. Therefore, during the discussion of these issues at the session, a broad mutual understanding was reached between socialist countries and major neutral countries in Asia and Africa – India, Indonesia, the United Arab Republic, Iraq, Afghanistan, Ghana, and Guinea.

Zorin pointed out that, contrary to the Soviet Union's position, the Western countries, led by the United States, did not make a positive contribution to the cause of strengthening peace and ensuring the freedom of all peoples in the discussion of any of the issues they put forward at the meeting. Zorin said that, of course, Western countries, first and foremost the United States, are still operating their infamous voting machine at the UN General Assembly in order to impose the resolutions they desire on the United Nations. However, this machine is now creaking, often malfunctioning, and sometimes completely inoperable.

Zorin condemned the Western countries, led by the United States, for flagrantly refusing to accept Khrushchev's proposal on complete and thorough disarmament submitted to the General Assembly on October 13th. Zorin pointed out that the US delegation at the meeting attempted to force through measures for the supervision of armaments, measures that would only benefit potential aggressors, to replace complete and thorough disarmament. He said that the discussion of the disarmament issue at the meeting showed that the Western countries were not only unwilling to carry out complete and thorough disarmament, but also disagreed with any measures to even temporarily halt the arms race.

Zorin said that the first stage of the meeting on the disarmament issue resulted in the adoption of two resolutions: not to continue testing nuclear weapons and to prevent the future spread of such weapons. These two resolutions were supported by the vast majority of countries in the world, with only the United States not giving its support!

Zorin then pointed out that the General Assembly's discussion on the issue of the complete and immediate eradication of colonialism was of great significance. He said that the moment when humanity is completely freed from the evil rule of colonialism is drawing ever closer.

Zorin said that the Soviet draft declaration on granting independence to colonial countries and peoples, with its condemnation of colonialism and colonial countries and its specific proposals, was supported by representatives of Asian and African countries and other countries that had gained independence through arduous struggles against colonialism. Almost all of the principled arguments in the Soviet draft declaration were included in the declaration on granting independence to colonial countries and peoples formulated by Asian and African countries, which has been accepted by the vast majority of UN member states. Eighty-nine member states voted in favor of the Asian-African declaration, and even the most arrogant colonial countries, such as Belgium or Portugal, did not dare to openly oppose this declaration stipulating the complete eradication of colonialism.

However, Zorin pointed out that countries such as the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Australia, and the Union of South Africa abstained when voting on the Asian-African proposal, indicating that colonialist countries have not laid down their weapons, and that they will continue to cling to colonialist policies and will not agree to eliminate colonial enslavement without a fight.

Zorin then spoke about the fierce struggle waged at the General Assembly and the Security Council on the issue of the situation in the Congo. He said that the Soviet Union's position on the Congo issue has received sympathy and support from major Asian and African countries in the United Nations. Together with socialist countries, they advocate taking a number of urgent measures in the Congo, first of all, advocating the release of Prime Minister Lumumba and other Congolese patriots who have been illegally deprived of their freedom, advocating the restoration of the normal activities of the legitimate government and parliament of the Congo, and advocating the disarmament of the Mobutu gang.

Zorin then spoke about the discussion of the Algerian issue at the meeting, saying that Arab countries and Asian and African countries, with the support of socialist countries, enabled the General Assembly to adopt a resolution supporting the Algerian people's right to self-determination and independence. A small handful of colonial countries, led by the United States, also adopted a negative stance on this issue.

Zorin said that the discussion at this session of the General Assembly on the issue of including the Soviet-proposed item on restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations on the agenda was also of major international significance. Representatives from many countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas unanimously pointed out at the meeting that refusing to restore the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is one of the most intolerable and dangerous manifestations of the "Cold War" policy pursued by US imperialism towards the cause of peace. They demanded an end to this policy and the restoration of the People's Republic of China's right to occupy a legitimate seat in the United Nations.

Zorin said that the United States had taken various means to exert pressure to prevent the General Assembly from resolving the issue of restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. Zorin said that there has been a clear shift in the mood of UN member states on this issue. Although the United States tried its best to put together a four-vote majority to prevent this session from discussing the issue of restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, the entire discussion of this issue by the General Assembly and the results of the discussion have been correctly assessed by world public opinion as a failure of the Eisenhower administration's policy.

Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: TASS, New York - Soviet Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Zorin, wrote a letter to the President of the United Nations General Assembly on the 21st, requesting that the documents of the Eighth Session of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea be circulated as official documents of the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly. Attached to the letter was a letter from DPRK Foreign Minister Pak Sung-chul to the President of the United Nations General Assembly and the Secretary-General, the report by Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the DPRK, Choi Yong-kun, "On Further Promoting the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland," a letter from the Supreme People's Assembly of the DPRK to the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea, various political parties, social organizations, and people of South Korea, as well as opinions on realizing economic and cultural exchanges between North and South Korea and seeking the independent development of the South Korean national economy.

    佐林就联大第十五届会议第一阶段工作发表声明
    谴责美国拒绝裁军建议支撑殖民制度
    指出美国阻挠恢复中国在联合国合法权利的“冷战”政策正在遭到失败
    据新华社22日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：苏联驻联合国常任代表佐林21日举行记者招待会，总结在20日结束的联合国大会第十五届会议第一阶段的工作。
    佐林在记者招待会上发表声明指出，以苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫为首的苏联代表团提交本届大会讨论的全面彻底裁军问题、消灭殖民主义问题、刚果局势问题、和恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利等问题，成了会议第一阶段工作的中心。
    佐林指出，苏联这样做是符合一切爱好和平的国家和人民的利益的。因此，在会议讨论这些问题的时候，社会主义国家同亚洲和非洲主要的中立国家——印度、印度尼西亚、阿拉伯联合共和国、伊拉克、阿富汗、加纳和几内亚等国之间，达到了广泛的相互了解。
    佐林指出，同苏联的立场相反，以美国为首的西方国家在会议上提出讨论的问题中，对任何一个问题的讨论都不会对加强和平和保证各国人民自由的事业作出积极的贡献。佐林说，当然，西方国家，首先是美国仍然在联合国大会上开动臭名远扬的表决机器，以便把它们所希望的决议强加于联合国。但是，这部机器现在开动起来已经是吱吱作响，常常发生故障，有时竟完全开不动了。
    佐林谴责以美国为首的西方国家在联大本届会议上，悍然拒绝接受赫鲁晓夫10月13日提交大会的关于全面彻底裁军问题的提案。佐林指出，美国代表团在会议上企图强行通过对军备进行监督的措施，即只会有利于潜在的侵略者的措施，来代替全面彻底裁军。他说，会议关于裁军问题的讨论表明，西方国家不仅不愿意全面彻底裁军，而且也不同意那怕是暂时停止军备竞赛的任何措施。
    佐林说，会议第一阶段对裁军问题的讨论结果通过了两项决议：不继续试验核子武器和防止今后扩大散布这种武器。这两项决议得到了世界绝大多数国家的拥护，只有美国不给予支持！
    佐林接着指出，大会关于彻底和立即消灭殖民主义问题的讨论具有巨大意义。他说，人类彻底摆脱殖民主义罪恶统治的时刻正在日益接近。
    佐林说，苏联关于给予殖民地国家和人民独立的宣言草案中对殖民主义和殖民主义国家的谴责和具体建议，受到同殖民主义者艰苦斗争获得了独立的亚非国家和其他国家代表的支持。苏联宣言草案中的原则论点，几乎全部包括到亚非国家制定的关于给予殖民地国家和人民独立的问题的宣言中，这个宣言已经为联合国绝大多数会员国接受，八十九个会员国投票赞成亚非国家宣言，而且甚至最狂妄的殖民主义国家，像比利时或葡萄牙之类，也不敢公开反对规定彻底消灭殖民主义的这个宣言。
    但是，佐林指出，像美国、英国、法国、比利时、西班牙、葡萄牙、澳大利亚、南非联邦这样一些国家，在表决亚非提案时弃权了，这说明殖民主义国家并没有放下武器，这表明，它们今后仍将抱住殖民主义政策，它们不会不经过战斗就同意消灭殖民奴役。
    佐林接着谈到本届大会和安全理事会就刚果局势问题展开的尖锐的斗争。他说，苏联在刚果问题上的立场在联合国中得到亚非主要国家的同情和支持。它们同社会主义国家一道，主张在刚果采取一些迫切的措施，首先是主张释放被非法剥夺了自由的卢蒙巴总理和其他刚果爱国者，主张恢复刚果合法政府和议会的正常活动，主张解除蒙博托匪帮的武装。
    佐林接着谈到会议关于阿尔及利亚问题的讨论说，阿拉伯国家和亚非国家在社会主义国家的支持下，使大会通过了一项支持阿尔及利亚人民自决权和独立权的决议。而以美国为首的一小撮殖民主义国家，在这个问题上也采取了否定的立场。
    佐林说，联大本届会议对把苏联提出的、关于恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利这一项列入议程的问题的讨论，也有重大的国际意义。欧洲、亚洲、非洲和美洲许多国家代表在会上一致指出，拒绝恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利，是美帝国主义执行的“冷战”政策的最难令人容忍的对和平事业最危险的表现之一。他们要求结束这一政策，恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中占有合法席位的权利。
    佐林说，美国曾经采取各种手段施加压力阻挠大会解决恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利的问题。佐林说，联合国会员国对这个问题的情绪发生了很明显的变化。美国虽然极力拼凑起四票的多数阻挠了这次会议讨论关于恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利问题。但是，联大对这一问题的全部讨论和讨论的结果，已被世界公众正确地估价为艾森豪威尔政府政策的失败。
    新华社22日讯　塔斯社纽约讯：苏联驻联合国常任代表佐林21日写信给联合国大会主席，要求把朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议第八次会议的文件作为联合国大会第十五届会议的正式文件予以散发。信中附有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴成哲致联合国大会主席和秘书长的信、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会委员长崔庸健《关于进一步促进祖国的和平统一》的报告、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议给大韩民国国会、南朝鲜各政党、社会团体和人民的信以及关于实现南北朝鲜之间的经济文化交流和谋求南朝鲜民族经济自主发展的意见书。
