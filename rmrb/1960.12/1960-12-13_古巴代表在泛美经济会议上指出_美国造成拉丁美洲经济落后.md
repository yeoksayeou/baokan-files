    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, December 9th. Cuban Revolutionary Government representative Pino Machado yesterday, at a special meeting of high-level government representatives for strengthening the Pan-American Economic and Social Council, condemned American imperialism as the cause of the economic backwardness of Latin American countries.
    Machado said, "The Cuban people know that the economic development problems of Latin American countries cannot be solved by piles of documents. They can only regret to say that they have no confidence whatsoever in the measures that may be decided upon at this meeting, because they clearly see how unwilling people are to say the key word that caused the economic misery of Latin America - imperialism. He pointed out that imperialism and monopoly organizations have caused economic deformities in Latin American countries. The United States cannot be interested in the economic development of the Latin American people, because that would jeopardize its own regime structure.
    Machado said, "In order to solve the problems of Latin America, it is necessary to start with the root of its disasters." Machado emphasized that Latin America must carry out a genuine land reform that will forever eliminate the latifundia system. He said that in Latin America, land is controlled by large estates and foreign monopolies like the United Fruit Company.

    古巴代表在泛美经济会议上指出
    美国造成拉丁美洲经济落后
    新华社哈瓦那9日电　古巴革命政府代表皮诺·马查多昨天在为加强泛美经济及社会理事会而举行的高级政府代表的特别会议上谴责说，是美帝国主义造成了拉丁美洲国家的经济落后的状况。
    马查多说，“古巴人民知道，拉丁美洲国家的经济发展问题是不能靠堆积如山的文件得到解决的，他们只得遗憾地说，他们对这次会议上可能决定采取的措施没有丝毫信心，因为他们清楚地看到，（会议上的）人们是如何不愿意说出造成拉丁美洲经济惨状的关键性的字眼——帝国主义。他指出，帝国主义和垄断组织造成了拉丁美洲国家中的经济畸形化。美国不可能对拉丁美洲人民的经济发展感到兴趣，因为那样一来，就是危害它本身的政权结构。
    马查多说，“为了解决拉丁美洲的问题，必须从它的灾难的根源着手。”马查多强调指出，拉丁美洲必须进行永远消灭大庄园制度的真正的土地改革。他说，在拉丁美洲，土地掌握在大庄园以及像联合果品公司这样的外国垄断企业手中。
