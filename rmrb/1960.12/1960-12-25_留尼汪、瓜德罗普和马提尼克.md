    Réunion, Guadeloupe, and Martinique

    Editor's Note: Among the fraternal parties that participated in the Moscow meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties were the Martinique Communist Party, the Guadeloupe Communist Party, and the Réunion Communist Party. Recently, some readers have written to this newspaper hoping to learn about Martinique, Guadeloupe, and Réunion. A brief introduction is provided below:

    Réunion: An island in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa, with an area of over 2,500 square kilometers and a population of over 300,000. Réunion became a French colony in 1815, and in 1946 it was changed to a French "overseas department." The French authorities have an administrative head stationed in the capital, Saint-Denis, divided into two arrondissements, nine districts, and twenty-three cantons. Réunion's main products are sugar, alcohol, coffee, vanilla, flavorings, etc., of which sugar exports account for four-fifths of the total exports. French monopoly capital controls the island's economy, and the local people live in extreme poverty under the cruel exploitation of colonialism.

    Guadeloupe: An archipelago in the West Indies in the Caribbean Sea in Central America. The entire island is divided into two main parts: the island proper in the west and Grande-Terre Island in the east, as well as five dependent islands. The archipelago has been under French colonial rule since 1815. In 1946, the French authorities forcibly merged it into a French province. The capital is Basse-Terre, and the highest head of the island is an administrative head appointed by France. The total area of the island is 1,760 square kilometers, and the population is more than 240,000, of which colonists account for only 2%. The main products are sugar cane, bananas, coffee and cocoa. The economy is controlled by France.

    Martinique: Also an island in the Caribbean Sea, separated from Guadeloupe by the island of Dominica in the Spanish West Indies Federation. It is also a French colony and was forcibly changed into a French province at the same time as Guadeloupe. The total area of the island is 1,090 square kilometers, and the population is 270,000. The capital is Fort-de-France. The economic situation is roughly the same as in Guadeloupe. (Attached picture)

    留尼汪、瓜德罗普和马提尼克
    编者按：参加莫斯科举行的各国共产党和工人党代表会议的兄弟党中，有马提尼克共产党、瓜德罗普共产党和留尼汪共产党。最近一些读者写信给本报，希望介绍一下关于马提尼克、瓜德罗普和留尼汪的情况，现简单介绍如下：
    留尼汪：是非洲东岸印度洋上的一个岛屿，面积二千五百余平方公里，人口三十余万。从1815年起，留尼汪就沦为法国的殖民地，1946年被改为法国的一个“海外省。”法国当局在岛上设有行政长官，驻在首府圣但尼，下分两个州、九个专区二十三个县。留尼汪主要产品为糖、酒精、咖啡、香草、香精等，其中糖的出口占出口总额五分之四。法国垄断资本控制了全岛的经济，而当地人民在殖民主义的残酷剥削下，生活困苦不堪。
    瓜德罗普：是中美洲加勒比海西印度群岛中的一个岛群。全岛分成两个主要部分，西部是岛本部，东部为格兰德——泰尔岛，另外还有五个附属岛屿。这个岛群从1815年起就处在法国殖民统治之下，1946年起被法国当局强行改并为法国一个省份，首府在巴斯—泰尔，由法国指派行政长官为岛上的最高首长。全岛面积一千七百六十平方公里，人口二十四万余人，其中殖民者只占2％。主要产品是甘蔗、香蕉以及咖啡、可可。经济上受到法国控制。
    马提尼克：也是加勒比海上的一个岛，和瓜德罗普仅隔一个西属西印度联邦的多米尼加岛。它也是法国的殖民地，与瓜德罗普同时被强行改为法国的一个省。全岛面积一千零九十平方公里，人口二十七万人。首府叫法兰西堡。经济状况和瓜德罗普大致相同。（附图片）
