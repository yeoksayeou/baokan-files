Xinhua News Agency, New York, 3rd -- News: Under pressure from the people, a judge of the United States Federal Court yesterday finally was forced to sign an order allowing William Foster, leader of the American Communist Party, to leave the United States to seek medical treatment in the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia.

Foster was allowed to go abroad for one year, but with the following conditions: he must notify the U.S. Attorney of one or more of his mailing addresses, as well as any changes to these addresses, so that he can be found at any time, and he must arrive in New York within twenty days after receiving a notice to return home.

Foster's lawyer, Mary Kaufman, told reporters that Foster's permission to go to the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia for medical treatment was the result of a long struggle in the courts. She recounted that the issue was first brought to the court in June 1959, at which time the court refused to allow Foster to leave the country.

    美国联邦法院在人民压力下
    被迫允许福斯特出国医病
    但仍蛮横规定无理的刁难条件
    新华社3日讯　纽约消息：美国联邦法院法官昨天终于被迫签署了一项命令，允许美国共产党领袖威廉·福斯特离开美国到苏联和捷克斯洛伐克就医。
    福斯特被允许出国一年，但附有下列条件：他必须把他的一个或数个通信地址以及这些地址的变化通知美国检察官，以便能够在任何时候找到他，并且在他接到要他回国的通知后二十天内到达纽约。
    福斯特的律师梅利·考夫曼对报界说，福斯特被准许去苏联和捷克斯洛伐克就医，是在各法院里进行了长期斗争的结果。她追述说，这个问题首次向法院提出是在1959年6月，当时法院拒绝允许福斯特出国。
