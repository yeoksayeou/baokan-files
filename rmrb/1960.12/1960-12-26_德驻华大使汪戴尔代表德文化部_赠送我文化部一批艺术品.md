Xinhua News Agency, 25th. German Democratic Republic Ambassador to China, Wang Daoyuan, on behalf of the Ministry of Culture of the German Democratic Republic, presented a batch of prints, sculptures, and oil paintings to our Ministry of Culture this morning.

    The presentation ceremony was held at the Ministry of Culture. Vice Minister of Culture Qian Junrui accepted the gifts on behalf of the Ministry of Culture.

    Vice Minister of Culture Xu Guangxiao, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zeng Yongquan, and Deputy Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Qu Wu attended the presentation ceremony.

    Also attending the ceremony were Zhu Kezhen, President of the Sino-German Democratic Republic Friendship Association, Liu Kaiqu, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Artists Association, artists Gu Yuan, and relevant personnel.

    Ambassador Wang Daoyuan said in his speech at the ceremony: I feel very honored and pleased to present this friendly gift to you on the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-German Friendship Treaty. He said: I am particularly pleased to be able to hand over to you the portraits and sculptures of the revolutionary pioneers of the German working class—Marx, Liebknecht, Thälmann, Pieck, and other comrades—who laid the cornerstone of the profound friendship between our two countries. He said that on the basis of the Friendship Treaty, the political, economic, and especially cultural relations between Germany and China have achieved fruitful development and have contributed to the socialist camp. The ambassador said, I am convinced that, as part of the socialist world system, the cultural relations between our two countries will continue to develop on the basis of closer unity in the future. Qian Junrui expressed his heartfelt thanks on behalf of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China for the gifts presented by the German Democratic Republic at the presentation ceremony. He said that we cherish these memorable gifts very much, and we cherish even more the fraternal friendship between the people of our two countries. Qian Junrui said that the signing of the Sino-German Friendship Treaty five years ago fixed the friendly cooperation between the two fraternal countries at the eastern and western outposts of the socialist camp in the form of a treaty. We are pleased to see that over the past five years, the friendship between the people of China and Germany has been growing, and the mutual assistance and cooperation between our two countries in political, economic, and cultural fields have been developing day by day. The solidarity between our two countries is being strengthened day by day. This kind of solidarity is being built in the struggle to realize our common ideals, complete our common cause, and oppose our common enemy—imperialism headed by the United States—and safeguard world peace, and this kind of solidarity cannot be destroyed by any force. After the presentation ceremony, the Ministry of Culture held a tea party to entertain Ambassador Wang Daoyuan and other diplomatic personnel from the German Democratic Republic in our country. The guests and hosts had a cordial and friendly conversation at the tea party.
