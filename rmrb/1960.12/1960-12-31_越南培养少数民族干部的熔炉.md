    The Central Nationalities Cadre School of Vietnam was established after the restoration of peace, with nearly a thousand students from twenty-five ethnic groups. In the past four or five years, this school has sent hundreds of political cadres to various places to participate in construction work, which is dozens of times more than the number of ethnic minority students during the century of French colonial rule in Vietnam. This has had a huge impact on the ethnic minorities in Vietnam who are fighting for the peaceful reunification of the country and yearning for the North.

    In the Central Nationalities Cadre School, the scene of the various ethnic groups of Vietnam uniting like brothers and sisters in the socialist family is specifically embodied. Ethnic minority students deeply appreciate the Party's kindness here, thus becoming more confident that the socialist revolution and the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the country will surely succeed. Recently, driven by the socialist transformation and socialist revolution movement, the students of all fraternal ethnic groups have shown good performance in their political stance, ideological level, national unity spirit, and participation in labor.

    In assisting farmers in fighting drought, participating in school building construction projects, flood and typhoon prevention, and building water conservancy projects, students have thrown themselves into these tasks with a positive attitude.

    National arts and literature have also been widely developed in the school. A national art troupe has been established. At the 7th World Youth and Students Festival for Peace and Friendship, the "Long Qiang Dance" performed by this troupe won a gold medal.

    越南培养少数民族干部的熔炉
    越南中央民族干部学校是在和平恢复以后才建立起来的，拥有二十五个民族的近千名学生。四、五年来，这个学校已经输送了数百名政治干部到各地参加建设工作，比法国殖民主义者统治越南百年期间的少数民族学生数目要多几十倍。这对于正在为和平统一祖国而斗争和一心向往北方的越南少数民族有着巨大的影响。
    在中央民族干部学校中，具体体现了越南各民族像兄弟姐妹一样地团结在社会主义大家庭中的景象。少数民族学生从这里深深体会到党的恩情，从而愈加相信社会主义革命和和平统一祖国的斗争一定成功。近来，经过社会主义改造和社会主义革命运动的推动，各兄弟民族学生的政治立场、思想水平、民族团结精神和参加劳动，都表现得很好。
    在协助农民抗旱、参加校舍建筑工程、防汛防台和修建水利的劳动中，学生们以积极的态度投身进去。
    民族文艺在学校中也得到了广泛的发展。一个民族文工团成立起来了。在第七届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节上，这个文工团演出的“龙锵舞”曾获得金质奖章。
