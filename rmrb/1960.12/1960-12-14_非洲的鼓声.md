    The Drumbeat of Africa
    Li Ying
    A friend told me: in Africa,
    People often play a passionate drum,
    The sound of the drum is sonorous and solemn,
    Like their land and their people.
    So I think of history,
    Africa, dawn and dusk for thousands of years,
    Reflected in drumheads soaked with tears,
    Anger burning on the drumheads.
    Today, when the last drop of blood,
    Has not yet seeped into the soil,
    The battle drums rise from all directions,
    For freedom, for independence, the drums cheer.
    Dong mou—dong mou, who is drumming?
    Announcing victory to the world;
    As if pounding strong chests,
    As if shaking the entire continent.
    Dong mou—dong mou, who is drumming?
    I can't see his face,
    But I see glittering tears,
    But I see the happiness of battle.
    No need to ask which country or people,
    It is Africa that is striding forward,
    Unite and persist in the struggle,
    Resolutely drive colonialism out of the continent!
    The drumbeats stir up the waves of the ocean,
    The ocean pours out a thousand years of pain,
    Listen to the shouts of countless people rising from the heart of the earth:
    Uhuru!—Uhuru! [Note]
    I listen to the news from Africa,
    As if touching the vibration of the eardrum;
    Africa, welcome to smile as you walk towards us,
    Like the rising sun emerging from the haze!
  [Note] Uhuru: African language, meaning freedom.

### 非洲的鼓声

    非洲的鼓声
    李瑛
    朋友告诉我：在非洲，
    常有人拍一种激情的鼓，
    那鼓声浑厚而庄严，
    像他们的土地和民族。
    于是我想起历史，
    非洲，千百年日落日出，
    映着眼泪滴湿的鼓面，
    鼓面上燃烧着愤怒。
    今天，当最后一滴血，
    还没有渗进泥土，
    战斗的鼓声起自四处，
    为自由、为独立，鼓在欢呼。
    咚哞——咚哞，是谁在敲呵？
    把胜利向世界宣布；
    仿佛捶打健壮的胸脯，
    仿佛摇撼整个大陆。
    咚哞——咚哞，是谁在敲呵？
    看不见他的脸，
    却看见闪光的泪珠，
    却看见战斗的幸福。
    不用问是哪个国家、民族，
    是非洲在迈动脚步，
    团结起来坚持斗争，
    坚决把殖民主义逐出大陆！
    鼓声掀起了大洋的浪涛，
    大洋在倾诉千年的痛苦，
    听多少人的喊声从地心腾起：
    乌呼鲁！——乌呼鲁！〔注〕
    我倾听着来自非洲的消息，
    仿佛触到了鼓膜的颤动；
    非洲，欢迎你微笑着向我们走来，
    犹如阴霾里旭日东出！
  〔注〕乌呼鲁：非洲语，即自由。
