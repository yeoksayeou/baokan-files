Xinhua News Agency report: Yunnan is launching a mass campaign to store and conserve water, making every effort to prepare sufficient water for spring planting next year.

This year, Yunnan Province experienced a rare autumn drought following a spring drought. The province's annual rainfall decreased by about 30% to 40% compared to last year. Therefore, this winter's water storage and conservation work is extremely important for next year's spring planting.

This winter, following the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, all localities, in addition to giving full play to the effectiveness of water conservancy projects built over the years, have also more prominently applied the experience accumulated by various ethnic groups over generations in storing water in small dams, storing water in winter fallow fields, sealing ditches to cut off flow, and lifting water for irrigation. In Chuxiong County, all communes have built dams across all six rivers within their boundaries, building more than 430 dams one after another, storing more than 30 million cubic meters of water in more than 7,000 small dams; the masses also used their years of experience to fill more than 7,500 winter fallow fields with "Laba water" (water stored in the twelfth lunar month). The county also erected 49 water pumps on the Longchuan River to pump river water to dams and winter fallow fields for storage. Therefore, although the county has suffered from drought for three consecutive years, the current water storage is still about 20% more than the same period last year.

While actively increasing water storage, all localities are also vigorously carrying out water conservation work to reduce seepage from reservoirs and dams. In Chengjiang County, leading cadres, technicians, and the masses combined their efforts and used only more than 150 workdays to repair the leaks in six reservoirs and dams. Now the county has increased its water storage by more than 3.7 million cubic meters. Funing County organized technical forces to repair leaks in seven reservoirs and seventy-eight dams. Therefore, even though it hasn't rained for more than two months, the county has also increased its water storage by more than 3.7 million cubic meters.

### 云南蓄水保水准备春耕

    云南蓄水保水准备春耕
    据新华社讯　云南展开群众性的蓄水保水工作，千方百计为明年春耕准备足够的水量。
    今年，云南省各地继春旱之后，又出现了历史上少见的秋旱。全省全年降雨量比去年减少了30％到40％左右。因此，今年冬季的蓄水保水工作对明年的春耕栽种十分重要。
    今冬各地都根据省委指示，除充分发挥历年兴修的水利工程的效用外，还更加突出地运用了各族人民世代积累的小坝塘蓄水、冬闲田蓄水、封沟断流和提水灌溉的经验。楚雄县各公社把境内六条河流全部筑坝拦蓄起来，先后打坝四百三十多座，给七千多个小坝塘蓄水三千多万方；群众还运用多年的经验，在七千五百多座冬闲田里灌了腊水。全县又在龙川江上架起了四十九台抽水机，把河水提到坝塘和冬闲田里蓄积起来。因此，这个县虽然连续遭受了三年干旱，目前的蓄水量仍比去年同期多20％左右。
    在积极增加蓄水的同时，各地还大力展开保水工作，减少水库坝塘的渗漏。澄江县由领导干部、技术员、群众三结合，只用一百五十多工日，就补好了六个水库、坝塘的漏洞。现在全县已增加蓄水量三百七十多万方。富宁县组织技术力量，补了七个水库和七十八个坝塘的漏洞。因此，在两个多月未下雨的情况下，全县也增加蓄水量三百七十多万方。
