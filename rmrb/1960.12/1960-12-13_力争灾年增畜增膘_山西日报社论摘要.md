　　Protecting and developing all productive forces to prepare for next year’s spring plowing is an extremely important task related to next year’s bumper harvest. Livestock is both the main power of agricultural production and the main source of organic fertilizer, so it should be carefully protected and strive for development. If we relax the management and feeding of livestock, resulting in livestock diseases and weakness, it will have a very unfavorable impact on next year's spring plowing and the entire agricultural production. Recently, some counties have put forward the slogan "Increase Livestock and Fatten Animals in Disaster Years." This slogan is very good and deserves widespread attention.

　　Disasters do bring great difficulties to the development of animal husbandry. However, these difficulties are not insurmountable. The Baijiagou Management Area of the Xingxian Lvliang Pioneer Commune, which is well-known throughout Shanxi Province, does not have good conditions. It has suffered disasters for two consecutive years last year and this year. However, the number of large livestock increased by 10% this year, and the increase rate of small livestock is even higher. "Dry Wanrong," which is famous for its drought, has suffered more severe disasters in the past eleven years since liberation in 1953, 1957, and the past two years. However, their animal husbandry has still grown year by year. Wenxi County, which has been lagging behind in large livestock for ten years, has criticized the conservative thinking on the development of animal husbandry from top to bottom since August last year, established the ambitious goal of catching up with Jishan, and improved leadership and management. In just one year, it achieved a 7% increase in large livestock in the disaster year. What do these examples illustrate? It shows that difficulties cannot become obstacles to our progress. As long as leading cadres dare to face difficulties and mobilize the masses to fight against difficulties, they will definitely be able to overcome them.

　　All our production activities (including animal husbandry) are fighting against nature. It is precisely in the long-term and frequent struggles that we gradually understand and grasp the laws of nature, increase our wisdom, and think of ways. For example, not long ago, large livestock in many places only used valley grass and wheat straw as fodder. With the continuous reproduction of livestock, these fodders were insufficient. Therefore, methods such as establishing fodder grass bases, harvesting grass, and storing green fodder were adopted, which greatly expanded the source of fodder, and the difficulty of insufficient fodder was relatively solved. In disaster years, fodder and feed are undoubtedly reduced, but can't we find some substitute feed and fodder? It is entirely possible. The vast number of commune members of the People's Commune, especially the veteran commune members, have many years of experience in raising livestock and fighting against nature. As long as we mobilize them and rely on them, the difficulty of fodder and feed can be solved.

　　The most important issue at present is to carefully arrange livestock fodder and feed. We should check the preparation of livestock fodder, feed, and heating equipment pen by pen, circle by circle, and team by team, just like checking the food, vegetables, and fuel in the canteen, and strive to implement everything. On the basis of checking and clarifying the bottom line, formulate a system such as "Know Fodder and Feed a Year in Advance." If the preparation of livestock fodder and feed is insufficient, a certain amount of labor should be drawn to concentrate on harvesting grass, processing straw, or finding other wild materials that can be used as fodder and feed to ensure that there is enough; for those that have been prepared, we must advocate careful calculation, make small streams flow steadily, cherish every stalk of grass and every grain of feed, and avoid waste.

　　From now until March and April next year is a critical period for protecting livestock. During this period, Party committees at all levels should arrange the work of protecting livestock to safely survive the winter as an important task for implementing the Party’s policy of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production. They must designate someone to be responsible for leading the livestock work, regularly check the wintering situation of livestock, and solve problems immediately when they are discovered.

    力争灾年增畜增膘
    ——山西日报社论摘要
    保护并发展一切生产力，为明年春耕做好准备，乃是关系明年农业大丰收的一项极为重要的任务。牲畜既是农业生产的主要动力，又是有机肥料的主要来源，更应加意保护，并力争有所发展。如果放松对牲畜的管理饲养工作，以致造成牲畜的疾病和瘦弱，那末，对明年春耕以及整个农业生产，就会造成十分不利的影响。最近有些县提出了“灾年增畜增膘”的口号，这个口号提得很好，值得普遍重视。
    灾荒给发展畜牧业带来的困难确实很大。但是，这些困难不是不能克服的。闻名山西全省的兴县吕梁先锋公社白家沟管理区条件并不好，去年和今年连续两年遭灾，今年的大牲畜却增殖了百分之十，小牲畜增殖率更高；素以干旱著称的“干万荣”，解放以后的十一年来，在一九五三、一九五七，和去今两年大灾荒年月，他们受到了更严重的灾荒，可是，他们的畜牧业仍然年年有所增长。十年来大牲畜一直落后的闻喜县，自去年八月以后，从上而下批判了发展畜牧业上的保守思想，树立了赶稷山的雄心大志，改进了领导和管理工作，仅仅一年，就在灾荒的年月里，取得了大牲畜增殖百分之七的成绩。这些例子说明了什么呢？它说明了困难并不能成为我们前进的阻碍，只要领导干部敢于正视困难，发动群众去和困难作斗争，就一定能战胜困难。
    我们的一切生产活动（包括畜牧业），都是在与自然界作斗争。正是在长期的频繁的斗争中，逐渐了解掌握了自然规律，增长了智慧，想到了办法。比如，在不久以前，许多地方的大牲口只用谷草、麦秸当饲草，随着牲畜的不断繁殖，这些饲草已感不足，于是又采用了建立饲草基地打草贮青等办法，扩大了许多饲草来源，饲草不足的困难就相对地解决了。在灾荒年月，饲草饲料无疑是减少了，但是，可以不可以寻找一些代饲料、饲草呢？完全是可能的。人民公社的广大社员，特别是老社员们，他们有着多少年饲养牲畜、向自然界作斗争的经验，只要发动他们，依靠他们，饲草饲料的困难是可以解决的。
    当前最主要的问题，是要认真安排牲畜的饲草饲料。应该像检查食堂的粮食、蔬菜、燃料等一样，逐槽逐圈逐队地检查牲畜饲草饲料和取暖设备的准备情况，力求样样落实。在检查澄底的基础上，制订“饲草饲料一年早知道”等制度。牲畜饲草饲料准备不足的，应抽出一定劳力，集中打草、处理秸秆或寻找其他可作饲草饲料的野生物资，保证够用；已经备妥的，要提倡精打细算，细水长流，珍惜每一节草和每一粒料，不使浪费。
    从现在起，到明春三、四月份，是保畜的关键时期。在这个时期，各级党委，应当把保护牲畜安全过冬工作，作为贯彻党的大办农业、大办粮食方针的重要任务去安排，要确定专人负责对牲畜工作的领导，要经常检查牲畜过冬情况，发现问题，立即解决。
