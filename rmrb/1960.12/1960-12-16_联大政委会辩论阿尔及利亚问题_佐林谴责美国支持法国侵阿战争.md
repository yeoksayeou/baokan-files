Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 14: In the recent two-day debate on the Algerian question in the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee, representatives of many countries strongly condemned the French colonialists' recent atrocities of massacring demonstrating Algerian residents in various parts of Algeria, condemned France's persistence in the colonial war in Algeria, and supported the Algerian people's demand for independence.

In his speech at the meeting on the morning of December 13, Soviet representative Zorin condemned France for committing new crimes in Algeria, shooting at thousands of unarmed Algerians and staining Algerian soil with blood.

Zorin also said that in France's shameful colonial war in Algeria, it is sided with by its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's military colonialist bloc. Zorin said that if France did not receive the political support and financial and material assistance from its NATO allies, especially the United States, it would not be able to prolong the war in Algeria for so long. He said, "Regardless of what the propagandists say, the fact is that American weapons are being used to massacre Arabs in Algeria." He said that the vast majority of the military aid France receives from the United States is used to suppress the Algerian national liberation movement. French colonialists are using American bombers to drop bombs on Algerian villages and cities. The helicopters used to attack Algerian guerrillas are made in the United States. The napalm bombs massively used by colonialists in Algeria are also marked with the words "Made in the U.S.A." He said that the Algerian war is the work of the Atlantic alliance, especially the United States. The United States is ready to plunder Algeria's resources—especially gas and oil—to ensure their infiltration into Africa.

Zorin pointed out that Western countries are doing their utmost to help the French colonialists, but are trying to deprive the Algerian Provisional Government, which represents the interests of the people, of the right to receive assistance from countries that stand on anti-colonialist positions, including socialist countries.

Zorin emphasized that more than half of humanity, including the People's Republic of China and the United Arab Republic, has declared recognition of the Algerian Provisional Government. Zorin said that as for the Soviet Union, it has provided all kinds of assistance and support since the first day of the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria.

Zorin then said that the Soviet Union supports the Algerian people's legitimate right to freedom and independence and advocates an immediate end to the Algerian war. Zorin expressed his support for the proposal on the Algerian question submitted to the Political Committee by the Asian and African countries.

Speaking at the afternoon meeting on December 13, Czechoslovak representative Nosek pointed out that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had organized a colonialist alliance to help France invade the Algerian people.

In his speech, Cuban representative Bಿಸ್ভি expressed the warm solidarity of the Cuban people with the fighting Algerian people. Bಿಸ್ভি severely condemned the French colonialists' appalling atrocities in Algeria. He expressed his belief that the Algerian people who have taken up arms to fight will surely win.

At the meeting on the 12th, U Thant, chairman of the Asian-African Group's special committee on the Algerian question, reported to the committee that more than 1,000 Algerian people had been massacred in the past forty-eight hours. He demanded that France stop the crime of massacring the Algerian people.

The Political Committee's debate on the Algerian question began on December 5. In the previous debates, representatives of some Asian and African countries mainly spoke. Guinean representative Ismail Touré condemned France for persisting in its colonial war.

At the meeting on the 12th, Burmese representative U Thant submitted a draft resolution to the General Assembly on behalf of twenty-two Asian and African countries, requesting the United Nations to recognize the Algerian people's right to self-determination and independence, and to effectively guarantee the successful and just exercise of self-determination on the basis of respecting Algeria's unity and territorial integrity.

The French representative has stubbornly refused to participate in the debate in the Political Committee. Western colonialist countries, such as the United States, have so far been slow to speak in the debate. At the beginning of the debate, the USIS revealed when talking about the US attitude that the United States was trying to make this debate "not hinder" the deceptive conspiracy that De Gaulle is currently playing on the Algerian question.

    联大政委会辩论阿尔及利亚问题
    佐林谴责美国支持法国侵阿战争
    据新华社14日讯　纽约消息：在联合国大会政治委员会最近两天关于阿尔及利亚问题的辩论中，许多国家的代表在发言中都严词谴责法国殖民者最近几天在阿尔及利亚各地屠杀进行示威的阿尔及利亚居民的暴行，谴责法国在阿尔及利亚坚持进行殖民战争，并且支持阿尔及利亚人民取得独立的要求。
    苏联代表佐林在13日上午会议上发言，谴责法国在阿尔及利亚犯下了新罪行，开枪射击数以千计的没有武装的阿尔及利亚人，使阿尔及利亚土地洒上了鲜血。
    佐林还说，在法国坚持在阿尔及利亚进行的可耻的殖民战争中，同它站在一起的，有它的北大西洋公约组织军事殖民主义集团盟国。佐林说，如果法国得不到它的北大西洋公约组织盟国、特别是美国的政治支持以及财政和物资援助，它是不能把阿尔及利亚的战争拖得这样久的。他说，“不管进行宣传的人说些什么，事实是，正在阿尔及利亚以美国武器屠杀阿拉伯人。”他说，法国从美国得到的军事援助的绝大部分被用来镇压阿尔及利亚的民族解放运动。法国殖民主义者是用美国的轰炸机把炸弹投掷在阿尔及利亚乡村和城市的。用来袭击阿尔及利亚游击队的直升飞机是美国造的。殖民主义者在阿尔及利亚大规模使用的凝固汽油弹也同样标有“美国造”的字样。他说，阿尔及利亚战争是大西洋联盟、特别是美国的作品。美国准备好搜刮阿尔及利亚的资源——特别是瓦斯与石油——这样来保证他们渗入非洲。
    佐林指出，西方国家竭力援助法国殖民主义者，但是却企图剥夺代表人民利益的阿尔及利亚临时政府得到站在反殖民主义立场上的国家，其中包括社会主义国家的援助的权利。
    佐林着重指出，目前有半数以上的人类，其中包括中华人民共和国、阿拉伯联合共和国，都宣布承认阿尔及利亚临时政府。佐林说，至于苏联，从阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府成立的第一天起，就给予各种援助和支持。
    佐林接着说，苏联支持阿尔及利亚人民对自由和独立的合法权利，主张立即停止阿尔及利亚战争。佐林表示支持亚非国家向政治委员会提出的关于阿尔及利亚问题的提案。
    在13日下午会议上发言的捷克斯洛伐克代表诺塞克指出，北大西洋公约组织国家组织了殖民主义者联盟来帮助法国侵略阿尔及利亚人民。
    古巴代表比斯维在发言中表示了古巴人民对战斗的阿尔及利亚人民的热烈声援。比斯维严厉谴责法国殖民主义者在阿尔及利亚的骇人听闻的暴行，他表示相信，拿起武器进行战斗的阿尔及利亚人民必将获得胜利。
    在12日的会议上，亚非集团阿尔及利亚问题特别委员会主席吴丹向委员会报告，在过去四十八小时内，已有一千多名阿尔及利亚人民被屠杀。他要求法国停止屠杀阿尔及利亚人民的罪行。
    政治委员会关于阿尔及利亚问题的辩论是从12月5日开始的。在前几次的辩论中，主要是一些亚非国家的代表发言。几内亚代表伊斯梅尔·杜尔在发言中谴责法国坚持进行殖民战争。
    缅甸代表吴丹在12日会议上代表二十二个亚非国家向大会提出一项决议草案，要求联合国承认阿尔及利亚人民的自决和独立权利，并且确实保证在尊重阿尔及利亚的统一和领土完整的基础上成功地和正当地行使自决权。
    法国代表一直横蛮地拒绝参加政治委员会的辩论。美国等西方殖民主义国家到现在为止还迟迟没有在辩论中发言。美新处在辩论开始时谈到美国的态度时透露，美国企图要使这次辩论“不妨碍”戴高乐目前在阿尔及利亚问题上玩弄的欺骗阴谋。
