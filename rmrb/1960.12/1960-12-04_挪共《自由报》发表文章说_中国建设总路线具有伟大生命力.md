	Norwegian Communist Party's "Friheten" Publishes Article Saying China's General Line for Construction Has Great Vitality
	(Dispatch from our newspaper) The Norwegian Communist Party's newspaper "Friheten" published an article on September 30th, titled "New China's Workers and Peasants are Leaping Forward," stating that the three fundamental factors behind the remarkable achievements of the Chinese people in construction are: the General Line for Socialist Construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes.

	The article continued: In China, the whole country is in the Great Leap Forward, resulting in unparalleled production growth. The article listed the production growth rates of steel, iron, electricity, and cement in the first half of 1960 and pointed out that even though agriculture suffered severe natural disasters last year, and this year there were serious droughts or floods, people still managed to maintain the production growth rate. Thanks to the People's Communes, extensive assistance and support, and the leadership of the Party, the summer harvest was still higher than last year.

	When discussing the technical revolution movement, the article wrote: Starting from the spring of 1960, China's socialist construction mass movement entered a new stage of technical innovation and technical revolution centered on automation or semi-automation. This movement can not only liberate heavy manual labor and greatly increase labor productivity, but also significantly improve product quality, produce a large number of new products, new processes, and new technologies, opening up a new path for the rapid, economical, and high-quality development of China's science and technology. The prospects of this movement are limitless. In rural areas, the mass movement for agricultural technical transformation, focusing on improved farm tools and semi-mechanized farm implements, has greatly developed. The peasant masses, combined with scientific and technical personnel, have created new farm tools and implements suitable for China's specific agricultural conditions, such as rice transplanters and wheat harvesters.

	The article pointed out: All these tremendous changes and achievements prove that the Party's General Line is completely correct and has great vitality. At the same time, it makes it richer and more complete.

	The reason why the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction has exerted such great power in the past and will exert even greater power in the future is because this General Line is a line that combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with China's specific practice, and because this General Line correctly reflects the objective laws of China's socialist economic development. The core of the General Line is to mobilize all forces that can be mobilized under the leadership of the working class, especially the great force of 500 million peasants, and adopt all forms and methods suitable to China's specific conditions to achieve a sustained leap forward in the national economy.

	The article also talked about the significance of industry supporting agriculture. The article said: Agriculture is the foundation of China's development of the national economy. The movement to support agriculture not only improves the technical equipment level of agriculture and promotes the development of agricultural production, but also helps to strengthen the worker-peasant alliance.

	The article concluded: The Chinese people have every reason to be satisfied with the achievements they have made in industrial and agricultural production, and the solid alliance of workers and peasants is also a guarantee for China to solve its future tasks.

### 挪共《自由报》发表文章说  中国建设总路线具有伟大生命力

    各国舆论盛赞中国人民的建设成就
    挪共《自由报》发表文章说
    中国建设总路线具有伟大生命力
    本报讯　挪威共产党机关报《自由报》在9月30日发表的以《新中国工农正在大跃进》为题的文章里说，中国人民在建设中取得奇妙成果的三个根本因素是：社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社。
    文章接着说：在中国，全国都在大跃进，结果是生产无比的增长。文章列举1960年上半年钢、铁、电力和水泥的生产增长速度，并且指出：即使在农业方面去年遭受很厉害的自然灾害，今年又有严重的旱灾或水灾，人们还是设法保持住了生产增长速度。由于人民公社，广泛的援助和支持及党的领导夏季收获量仍比去年为高。
    在谈到技术革命运动时，文章写道：从1960年春季起始，中国的社会主义建设群众运动就进入了一个以自动化或半自动化为中心的技术革新与技术革命的新阶段。这一运动不仅能够解放笨重的体力劳动，大大提高劳动生产率，而且能够显著提高产品的质量，产生大量的新产品及新工艺、新技术，为中国的科学技术的多快好省的发展开辟出一条新的道路，这个运动的前途是无可限量的。在农村中，以改良农具和半机械化农具为主的农业技术改造的群众运动，已有了很大的发展。农民群众和科学技术人员结合起来，创造了适合于中国农业耕作具体条件的新农具和新工具，如水稻插秧机、割麦机等。
    文章指出：所有这些巨大的变化和成就证明党的总路线是完全正确的并具有着伟大的生命力。同时又使其更加丰富和完备。
    党的社会主义建设总路线在过去能够发挥这样大的威力，在将来还要发挥更大的威力，就是因为这条总路线是马克思主义列宁主义普遍真理同中国具体实践相结合的路线，就是因这条总路线正确的反映了中国社会主义经济发展的客观规律。总路线的核心，就是在工人阶级的领导下，调动一切可以调动的力量，首先是五亿农民这个伟大的力量，采取一切适合中国具体条件的形式和方法，实现国民经济的持续跃进。
    文章还谈到工业支援农业的意义。文章说：农业是中国发展国民经济的基础，支援农业运动不仅提高了农业的技术装备水平，促进了农业生产之发展，而且也有助于加强工农联盟。
    文章最后写道：中国人民有充分的理由对他们在工农业生产上所取得的成就感到满意，工农的牢固联盟也是中国解决其未来任务的保证。
