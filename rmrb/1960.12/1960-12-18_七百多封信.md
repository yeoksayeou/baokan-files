    More Than Seven Hundred Letters

    Recently, the Shanghai Xinguang Furniture Store has been receiving letters from customers every day, offering many valuable suggestions.

    This furniture store, which combines production and sales, mostly sells wooden furniture that they manufacture themselves. How to ensure that customers buy satisfactory furniture has been a constant consideration for the sales staff. They adopted a new service method: sending letters to old customers who had bought furniture in the store in the past two years, soliciting their opinions. So far, more than seven hundred letters have been sent, and more than two hundred replies have been received.

    Many old customers enthusiastically told the store in their letters what kind of furniture they needed and which styles they preferred. The store has referred to these opinions and designed and manufactured forty-six new styles of furniture. Some of these can be used for multiple purposes, saving materials and being practical. For example, a dual-purpose writing desk can be opened to reveal a mirror, functioning as a dressing table. Another type is a folding chair embedded in the panels on both sides of the wardrobe, which can be taken out when needed and put back in when not in use, taking up no floor space in the room. There is also a seemingly ordinary chest of drawers, but by pulling out a table top in the middle, it can be used as a writing desk.

    七百多封信
    最近一个时期，上海新光家具商店每天都收到顾客来信，向他们提出许多宝贵意见。
    这家亦工亦商的家具店，卖的木器家具大都是自己造的。怎样使顾客买到称心如意的家具，是营业员们脑子里一直考虑的问题。他们采取了一种新的服务方法：向这两年曾经在店里买过家具的老顾客发信，征求他们的意见。到现在一共寄出七百多封信，收到二百多封回信。
    许多老顾客在信上热情地告诉商店自己需要什么家具，哪种式样最合意。商店参考这些意见，设计制造出四十六种新式样的家具。有些可以一件多用，既省料，又实用。譬如一种两用写字台，翻开台板，就露出一面镜子，可以当梳妆台。另有一种折椅，嵌在衣橱两旁的板上，要坐的时候取出来，不用就放进去，丝毫不占房间地面。还有一种看来是具普通的五斗柜，但是在中间抽出一块台板来，就可当写字台了。
