Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 27th: This reporter reports: Inspired by the magnificent Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965), Soviet industrial and agricultural workers, with high enthusiasm and courageous labor, are victoriously completing this year's production and construction tasks, enabling the national economy to achieve further development.

According to Soviet press reports, a significant feature of the Soviet national economic development this year is that the development speed of various departments, especially industrial departments, has greatly exceeded the original targets controlled by the Seven-Year Plan. It is estimated that the national industrial production plan will be overfulfilled by 3% this year, and the total industrial output value will increase by 10% compared to last year. The total industrial output value for the two years of 1959 and 1960 will increase by 23% compared to 1958.

On the basis of implementing the policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, the increase in important products of the Soviet heavy industry sector this year has exceeded the highest annual increase in the past. The achievements made by workers in the steel industry, machinery manufacturing industry, and electric power industry in production are particularly outstanding. According to reports, the net increase in steel production this year will reach more than 5.1 million tons, following last year's unprecedented record of 5 million tons in the history of the Soviet steel industry. This will bring the annual steel production to a breakthrough of 60 million tons, reaching about 65 million tons, almost equivalent to the total steel production of the Soviet Union in the eighteen years from 1918 to 1935. The machine manufacturing industry, which bears an important task in the technological progress of the national economy, has rapidly increased the production of first-class machinery and equipment, mechanization, and automated production lines this year. The development of the electric power industry is also very rapid. In this year, the Soviet Union has put more than 6 million kilowatts of new power generation capacity into production, which is about 1 million kilowatts more than the average annual power generation capacity put into production in the past.

In addition, the Soviet chemical, petroleum, cement, and other industries have also continued to achieve high-speed development, and the output of some important products will have a very large increase.

Rapid and large-scale capital construction is an important link in promoting the further development of the Soviet national economy this year. This year, the state's capital construction investment increased by 28 billion rubles compared to last year. More than 1,000 large projects have been completed and put into production in one year, which means that an average of three projects are completed and put into production every day and night. Among the newly built enterprises, many are world-class. For example, in November this year, the Lenin Steel Plant in Krivoy Rog, Ukraine, built the world's largest blast furnace, with a volume of 2,000 cubic meters. The world's largest hydropower station—the Stalingrad Hydropower Station with a power generation capacity of 2.415 million kilowatts—was also completed at the end of this year. According to statistics, since the implementation of the Seven-Year Plan, the Soviet Union has built more than 2,000 new large-scale projects, and the investment in national economic capital construction in the past two years is more than the total investment in the twenty-two years before the Second World War.

On the agricultural front, natural conditions in many areas of the Soviet Union this year were very unfavorable to agricultural production. However, through hard work, the broad masses of agricultural workers still achieved a good harvest. According to reports, the state's grain purchase volume this year is still not lower than last year. This year is the highest year for sugar beet production in the Soviet Union. The purchase volume of oil crops, fruits, tea, etc. will all exceed last year. Cotton has also achieved a good harvest. In terms of animal husbandry, the number of livestock and the state's purchase volume of livestock products are also higher than last year.

At present, the Soviet Union's various republics and national economic regions are reporting good news of completing this year's production plans ahead of schedule. The industrial production of many regions has reached the level of 1961 or 1962, thereby creating a higher starting point for the production of the coming year.

    七年计划鼓舞着工农业劳动者
    苏联国民经济今年进一步发展
    据新华社莫斯科27日电　本社记者报道：苏联工农业劳动者在宏伟的七年计划（1959—1965年）的鼓舞下，热情高涨，奋勇劳动，胜利地完成着今年的生产和建设任务，使国民经济获得了进一步的发展。
    据苏联报刊报道，苏联今年国民经济发展的一个显著特点是：各部门，特别是工业部门的发展速度大大地超过了七年计划控制数字原订的指标。预计，今年全国的工业生产计划将超额3％完成，工业总产值将比去年增长10％。1959和1960年这两年的工业总产值将比1958年增长23％。
    在执行优先发展重工业方针的基础上，苏联今年重工业部门重要产品的增长额超过了以往最高的年度的增长额。钢铁工业、机器制造业和电力工业工人在生产中取得的成就十分突出。据报道，今年钢产量的纯增长额，将继去年创造的苏联钢铁工业史上的五百万吨空前纪录之后，达到五百一十万吨以上。这将使全年的钢产量突破六千万吨大关而达到六千五百万吨左右，差不多相当于苏联在1918—1935年十八年期间钢产量的总和。在国民经济的技术进步中担负着重要任务的机器制造工业，今年十分迅速地增加了第一流机器装备、机械化和自动化作业线的生产。电力工业的发展也很迅速。在这一年中，苏联共有六百多万瓩新的发电能力投入生产，即比以往平均每年投入生产的发电能力增加约一百万瓩。
    此外，苏联的化学、石油、水泥等工业也继续获得了高速度的发展，一些重要产品的产量都将有极大的增长。
    迅速和大规模地进行基本建设，是推动苏联今年国民经济进一步发展的一个重要环节。今年，国家的基本建设投资比去年增加了二百八十亿卢布。一年之中有一千多项大工程建成并投入生产，即平均每昼夜就有三项工程完工和投入生产。在新建成的企业中，有许多都是世界第一流的，例如，今年11月乌克兰的克里沃罗格市列宁钢铁厂建成了世界上最大的一座高炉，它的容积是二千立方米。世界上最大的水电站——发电能力达二百四十一万五千瓩的斯大林格勒水电站，也是在今年末建成的。据统计，自七年计划执行以来，苏联已经建成了两千多项新的大型工程，两年中用于国民经济基本建设的投资，比第二次世界大战前二十二年的投资总和还多。
    在农业战线上，今年苏联许多地区的自然条件对农业生产十分不利，但是，广大农业劳动者通过辛勤的劳动，仍然获得了良好的收成。据报道，今年国家的谷物收购量仍不低于去年。今年是苏联甜菜生产最高的年份。油料作物、水果、茶叶等的收购量都将超过去年。棉花也获得了良好的收成。在畜牧业方面，牲畜头数和国家畜产品的收购量也高于去年。
    目前，苏联各加盟共和国和国民经济区正在传来提前完成今年生产计划的捷报，许多地区的工业生产已经达到了1961年或1962年的水平，从而为即将到来的一年的生产创造更高的起点。
