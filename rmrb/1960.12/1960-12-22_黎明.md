    Dawn
    Painting by Ling Yun, Poem by Lin Bi
    The moon sets on the horizon, the willow breeze is light, and the morning mist drifts like smoke, pausing and stopping. The steel mill's whistle sounds, and another day dawns. The fire beside the furnace is strong, and the molten steel surges, just like the heroic steelmakers. The red sun rises in the east, joyfully watching the giant dragon ascend. (Image attached)

    黎明
    凌云画  林碧诗天边月落，杨柳风轻，朝雾如烟飘又停。钢厂汽笛响，一日又黎明。炉边火旺，钢水翻腾，恰似英雄炼钢人。东方红日起，喜看巨龙升。（附图片）
