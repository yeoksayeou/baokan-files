    Front and Rear
    —Seeing Off Comrades Supporting the Front Lines of Agricultural Production (Fifteen)
    Ge Song
    These days, whether it is on the blackboard newspapers in government offices, at farewell parties, or on the streets, in vehicles, as long as you pay a little attention, you can see scenes of enthusiastic farewells and mutual encouragement, and you can even hear moving heroic words.
    Comrades going to the forefront of agricultural production said: "We are determined to run the rural people's communes well, produce more grain, and strive for a greater leap forward in agriculture."
    Comrades staying in their original posts also said: "We are determined to undertake the work you have left behind and ensure that it is done quickly and well."
    This guarantee is very important. The People's Daily reported on November 23 that 70% of the cadres of county-level government offices in Huai'an County, Jiangsu Province, have gone to the forefront of agricultural production to strengthen the rural work force. The comrades who stayed behind have launched a "clever government work" competition. They not only managed to do more work with fewer people and do things well, but also allowed half of the cadres remaining in the government offices to take turns working at the grassroots level, greatly improving work efficiency.
    The situation in Huai'an County, where the front and rear are of one heart and one mind, twisted into one rope, and promoting the work of the entire line, is a microcosm of our many government offices and departments. This is not only a glorious tradition of revolutionary struggle, but also an important guarantee for the continuous victory of the revolutionary cause. At present, the Party's policy of vigorously developing agriculture and grain is like fighting on the front lines. A large number of cadres, workers, and educated youth are going to the forefront of agricultural production, which is also to concentrate superior forces to demand rewards from nature and greatly push rural work forward. Precisely because this task is so important, it is necessary to concentrate a large number of crack troops and generals to seriously compete with it several times. In this way, the strength of the front is strengthened, and the manpower in the rear will naturally be relatively reduced. But will the work in the rear be reduced? No. On the contrary, the tasks will become more and more, and the burdens will become heavier and heavier.
    In the long and arduous war years of the past, under the correct leadership of the Party, the front and rear were of one heart and one mind, with one energy. We overcame many difficulties and hardships, and walked through many high mountains and evil waters, moving from one victory to another. The frontline soldiers opened mountains and broke ridges, cleared the way through thorns and brambles, and established immortal feats. The comrades in the rear fully supported, ensured the supply of grain and ammunition, and consolidated the base areas, and also established great achievements. The tasks of the comrades working in the rear are also extremely heavy, but everyone diligently carries the heavy burden on their shoulders, and supplies as much manpower and material resources as possible to the front, striving for victory to come faster and the results to be greater. Let us learn from the spirit of the comrades in Huai'an County and continue to carry forward the revolutionary tradition. Let the front and rear launch a revolutionary competition!
    Comrades who support the front lines of agricultural production, go ahead with confidence, dear comrades-in-arms! We are waiting for the good news you send back from the front, and we will also constantly report our new achievements to you!

    前方和后方
    ——十五送支援农业生产第一线的同志
    戈松
    这几天，无论在机关的黑板报上，在欢送会上，或是街头巷尾，车上车下，只要你稍加注意，就可以看到热烈话别、互相勉励的情景，更可以听到动人的豪言壮语。
    到农业生产第一线的同志说：“我们决心办好农村人民公社，打更多的粮食，争取农业的更大跃进。”
    留在原来工作岗位上的同志也说：“我们决心承担你们留下来的工作，保证作得又快又好。”
    这个保证十分重要，11月23日《人民日报》报道，中共江苏省淮安县县级机关的干部们，有70％走上了农业生产第一线，加强农村工作的力量；留下来的同志，开展了“巧作机关工作”的竞赛。他们不仅做到了人少多办事、把事情办好，而且还能使留在机关的干部，也有一半人轮流到基层工作，大大地提高了工作效率。
    在淮安县出现的前方后方一条心、拧成一股劲、推动全线工作的局面，正是我们许多机关、许多部门的缩影。这不仅是革命斗争的光荣传统，而且也是革命事业不断取得胜利的重要保证。目前，党的大办农业、大办粮食的方针，好比前方作战一样，大批干部、工人和知识青年等等走上农业生产第一线，也是集中优势兵力向大自然去索取酬报，把农村工作大大向前推进一步。正因为这个任务如此重大，才需要集中大批精兵强将，同它认真较量几番。这样，前方的力量加强，后方的人力自然相对地就要减少。可是后方工作会不会减少呢？不。相反，任务还会越来越多，担子还会越来越重。
    在过去长期的、艰苦的战争岁月里，在党的正确领导下，前方后方一条心、一股劲，我们克服了多少艰难困苦，走过了多少高山恶水，从一个胜利走向一个胜利。前线战士开山辟岭、披荆斩棘，建立了不朽的功勋；后方的同志全力支援，保证粮草弹药的供应，巩固根据地，同样建立了丰功伟绩。在后方工作的同志，任务同样极其繁重，但是大家勤勤恳恳地把重担挑在肩上，把尽可能多的人力物力供应前方，争取胜利来得更快些，战果更大些。让我们学习淮安县同志们的劲头，把革命传统继续发扬下去。前方和后方开展一个革命的竞赛！
    支援农业生产第一线的同志，你们放心前去吧，亲爱的战友们！我们等待着你们从前方寄回来的捷报，也把我们的新成就不断地报告你们！
