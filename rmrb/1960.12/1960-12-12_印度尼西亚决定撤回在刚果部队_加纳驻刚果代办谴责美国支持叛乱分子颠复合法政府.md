Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 10th: Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio announced at a press conference this evening that the Indonesian government has decided to withdraw its troops sent to the Congo under the command of the "UN forces," because the tasks they are now performing are not in line with the tasks entrusted to them by the Indonesian government and people.

He said that this instruction has also been issued to the Indonesian representative to the United Nations.

Subandrio said that the Indonesian troops currently in the Congo should not be used to rebuild neo-colonialism and protect neo-colonial interests in the Congo. He said that the United Nations has not fulfilled its responsibilities in the Congo, and Indonesia's withdrawal of troops from the Congo is consistent with the actions of many Asian and African countries.

He said that since the kidnapping of Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba, the Indonesian government has made its best efforts to enable the "UN forces" to release Lumumba. But until now, they have not been able to do so.

Subandrio said that for Indonesia, the arrest of Lumumba and the rough treatment of him means that the "UN forces" have failed to fulfill the tasks that people expected them to fulfill, such as protecting the interests of all Congolese people.

Xinhua News Agency, December 9th: Accra Dispatch: Ghanaian Chargé d'Affaires in Congo, Welbeck, pointed out at a mass rally attended by thousands of people in Accra on the evening of the 8th that the current chaotic situation in the Congo was created single-handedly by Western countries such as the United States, which have been supporting the traitorous groups in the Congo. He said, "The truth about the situation in the Congo is that the whites want to turn the Congo into a cash cow-style territory."

Welbeck warned that "if we don't pay attention, the United States—this greedy country—will endanger the independence of Africa."

Welbeck was forced to leave Leopoldville on November 22nd and return to Accra. Because Ghana expressed its support for Lumumba's legitimate government, the imperialists, headed by the United States, instructed the Congolese Mobutu traitorous group to use force to force him to leave the Congo. He said that the Americans even wanted their Congolese puppets to try to murder him. After returning to Accra, he told the press that "only colonialists and imperialists are creating serious obstacles to prevent the establishment of peace in the Congo. Americans, French, British and Belgians provide active and extensive assistance to the Congolese rebels through various means. For example, Mobutu has received, and continues to receive, an astonishing amount of money and arms and ammunition, which are used to eliminate the legitimate government of the Congo."

    印度尼西亚决定撤回在刚果部队
    加纳驻刚果代办谴责美国支持叛乱分子颠复合法政府
    据新华社雅加达10日电　印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约今天晚上在记者招待会上宣布，印度尼西亚政府已经决定撤回它派到刚果受“联合国军”司令部指挥的部队，因为他们现在执行的任务不符合于印度尼西亚政府和人民交给他们的任务。
    他说，这项指示也已经发给印度尼西亚驻联合国的代表。
    苏班德里约说，现在在刚果的印度尼西亚部队不应当被用来重建新殖民主义和保护新殖民主义在刚果的利益。他说，联合国没有履行它在刚果的职责，印度尼西亚军队从刚果撤退的行动同很多亚非国家的行动是一致的。
    他说，自从刚果总理卢蒙巴被绑架以来，印度尼西亚政府作出最大的努力，以便使“联合国军”能够释放卢蒙巴。但是直到现在，他们并没有能够这样做。
    苏班德里约说，对印度尼西亚来说，逮捕卢蒙巴并粗暴地对待他意味着，“联合国军”没有能够履行人们期望他们履行的任务，如：保护全体刚果人民的利益。
    新华社9日讯　阿克拉消息：加纳驻刚果大使馆代办韦尔贝克8日晚在阿克拉有数千人参加的群众大会上指出，刚果当前的混乱局势是美国等西方国家一手造成的，它们一直支持着刚果的叛国集团。他说，“刚果局势的真相是，白人想把刚果变成一个摇钱树式的领地”。
    韦尔贝克提出警告说，“如果我们不加注意的话，美国——这个贪婪的国家——将危害非洲的独立”。
    韦尔贝克是11月22日被迫离开利奥波德维尔回阿克拉的。由于加纳表示支持卢蒙巴合法政府，以美国为首的帝国主义曾指使刚果蒙博托叛国集团用武力强迫他离开刚果。他说，美国人甚至要他们的刚果傀儡试行谋杀他。他回阿克拉后曾向报界发表谈话说，“只有殖民主义者和帝国主义者在制造严重障碍，不让刚果建立和平。美国人、法国人、英国人同比利时人通过各种办法给予刚果叛乱分子以积极和广泛的援助。例如，蒙博托过去和现在都得到多得惊人的金钱和枪支弹药，以便用来消灭刚果合法政府。”
