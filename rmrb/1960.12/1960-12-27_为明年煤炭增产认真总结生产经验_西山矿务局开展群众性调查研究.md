    For Next Year's Coal Production Increase, Seriously Summarize Production Experience
    Xishan Mining Bureau Carries Out Mass Investigation and Research
    (Our newspaper, Taiyuan, December 26th) The Taiyuan Xishan Mining Bureau, centering on mining, tunneling, and transportation, is carrying out mass investigation and research activities to summarize new technologies and new experiences to prepare for next year's coal production.
    In order to summarize advanced experiences, explore production laws, and strive to increase coal production next year, the Xishan Mining Bureau's Party Committee, starting in November, selected dedicated personnel to combine with the masses of workers to conduct investigation and research activities. Offices were established at the bureau, mine, and pit levels, and working groups were formed to carry out the investigation work.
    The specific method of investigation and research is: first organize the broad masses of workers to have extensive discussions, summarize production increase experiences, find the weak links in current production, formulate plans for promoting advanced experiences and comprehensive reforms based on past experience and aimed at the current weak links in production, as a basis for guiding next year's production. The problems discovered during the investigation and research are mostly concentrated in three aspects: coal mining, tunneling, and transportation. In terms of mining and tunneling, the proportion of miners and tunnelers in the total number of employees in the bureau is relatively low. In terms of transportation, the transportation line in the Jiaozigou pit of Ximing Mine is as long as 7,900 meters, and it has to go through nine transportation links including coal chutes, belts, winches, manual pushing, and electric car pulling, which requires an average of fifteen to twenty minutes to transport one ton of coal. No. 1 Pingdong of Guandi Mine not only has many transportation sections, but also has slopes of ten to seventeen degrees. Shortening the transportation line has become an important key to increasing coal production next year. Due to multi-stage transportation and uneven lines, the bureau has produced 900,000 tons less raw coal this year. This investigation and research also found that the output per unit area is growing rapidly, but the tunneling speed is very slow, and the mining and tunneling are not compatible.
    In response to the above problems, the Party Committee of the bureau mobilized the workers to seriously summarize experience and overcome weak links. A mass movement of great improvement and great summarization, centered on mining, tunneling, and transportation, quickly formed throughout the bureau, with everyone thinking of ways and everyone finding experience. In terms of transportation, cadres from the bureau's agencies went deep into the site and jointly investigated and researched with the workers, and summarized the experience of Du'erping Mine's Shiwuchi Pit in shortening the transportation line. In terms of tunneling, the mines and pits summarized the experience of rapid tunneling, with a single heading advancing 300 meters per month. In terms of coal mining methods, Baijiazhuang Mine summarized the experience of the Red Flag Coal Mining Team maintaining a monthly output of 20,000 tons and achieving large-scale high yield, Du'erping Mine summarized the experience of "rocket-style" coal mining, and other mines and pits summarized the experience of "longwall," "knife pillar," and "full-height mining." Finally, the bureau leaders combined the above experiences, formulated technical reform plans layer by layer from bottom to top, and further mobilized the masses to concentrate their efforts on solving the problems in transportation and mining. In order to improve transportation efficiency, in the spirit of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, they leveled the uneven lines, changed multi-stage transportation to short-stage transportation, and changed endless rope transportation to electric car transportation. Jiaozigou Pit plans to change nine-stage transportation to five-stage transportation. After the reform of the entire transportation line of the bureau, the transportation distance will be shortened by half, and two-thirds of the auxiliary workers can be saved to enrich underground production. After the transportation belt of Songshukeng in Baijiazhuang Mine and the large truck yard of Du'erping Mine and Guandi Mine were quickly constructed and put into production, the transportation efficiency can be doubled. In order to strengthen mining and tunneling work, the bureau has successively transferred more than 900 cadres to serve as team and group leaders and miners and tunnelers, most of whom were skilled workers on the mining and tunneling front in the past. At the same time, the labor force and machinery and equipment of the existing working faces have been adjusted to ensure that each pit has a complete set of spare working faces, creating conditions for large-scale high yield, and strengthened the technical transformation of mining and tunneling, transferring professional personnel to study coal mining and tunneling methods suitable for the characteristics of the mine, and quickly improve tunneling efficiency and coal mining mechanization.

    为明年煤炭增产认真总结生产经验
    西山矿务局开展群众性调查研究
    本报太原26日电　太原西山矿务局以采、掘、运为中心，开展群众性的调查研究活动，总结新技术和新经验，为明年煤炭生产做好准备工作。
    西山矿务局为了总结先进经验，摸索生产规律，力争明年煤炭增产，局党委从11月开始，就抽调专人与职工群众相结合，进行调查研究活动；局、矿、坑都成立了办公室，组成工作组进行调查工作。
    调查研究的具体作法是：先组织广大职工广泛讨论，总结增产经验，寻找当前生产的薄弱环节，根据以往的经验，并针对当前生产的薄弱环节，制订出推广先进经验和全面改革方案，作为指导明年生产的依据。调查研究中发现的问题，大部分集中在采煤、掘进、运输等三个方面。在采掘方面，采掘工人在全局总人数中所占的比重较低；在运输方面，西铭矿茭子沟坑的运输线路长达七千九百多米，中间要经过煤溜子、皮带、绞车、人推、电车拉等九道运输环节，平均运一吨煤要花费十五至二十分钟的时间。官地矿一号平峒，不仅运输段数多，而且坡度都在十到十七度以上。缩短运输线路就成为明年煤炭增产的重要关键。全局因为多段运输、线路不平，今年以来就少产原煤九十万吨。这次调查研究中，还发现单位面积产量增长快，掘进进尺的速度很缓慢，回采与掘进不相适应。
    针对以上存在问题，局党委发动职工，认真总结经验，克服薄弱环节。全局很快形成了一个以采、掘、运为中心，大改进、大总结的群众运动，人人想办法，个个找经验。在运输方面，局机关干部深入到现场和工人共同调查研究，总结了杜儿坪矿十五尺坑缩短运输线路的经验；在掘进方面，各矿、坑总结了快速掘进、单头月进三百米的经验；在采煤方法上，白家庄矿总结了红旗采煤队保持月产两万吨，获得大面积丰产的经验，杜儿坪矿总结了“火箭式”采煤的经验，其他矿、坑分别总结了“长壁式”、“刀柱式”和“一采全高”的经验。最后，局领导把上述这些经验，加以综合配套，由下到上层层制订技术改革规划，进一步发动群众集中力量解决运输和采掘方面的问题。为了提高运输效率，他们本着勤俭办企业的精神，线路不平的拉平，多段运输改为小段运输，无极绳运输改为电车运输。茭子沟坑准备把九段运输改为五段运输。全局整个运输线路改革后，运输距离缩短一半，并可节约出三分之二的辅助工人充实井下生产。白家庄矿松树坑运输皮带、杜儿坪矿和官地矿的大车场，经过快速施工，竣工投入生产后，运输效率可提高一倍。为了加强采掘工作，全局先后抽调了九百多名干部担任队、组长和采掘工人，这些人大部分都是过去采掘战线上的能手。同时，对现有工作面的劳动力、机械设备作了调整，使每个坑口经常保持一个设备齐全的备用工作面，为大面积高产创造了条件，并加强了采掘技术改造，抽调专业人员，研究适合本矿特点的采煤、掘进方法，迅速提高掘进效率和采煤机械化水平。（附图片）
