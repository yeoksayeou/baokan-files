    Yangzhou Special District Exploits Local Resources to Develop Non-Staple Foods
    Anqing Special District Uses River and Lake Barriers to Trap Fish and Shrimp

    (Our report) Since the beginning of winter, the Party committees at all levels in Jiangsu's Yangzhou Special District have seized the favorable opportunity of the winter slack season to mobilize the masses to develop sideline production in accordance with local conditions. Currently, the district has mobilized 430,000 laborers for sideline production, accounting for 21% of the total labor force. Since early November, the value of winter sideline production has reached more than 7.6 million yuan, and 220 million catties of firewood have been cut, doubling the amount in the same period last year. The daily output of fish has also doubled compared to October.

    In winter sideline production, various areas of Yangzhou Special District have fully exploited non-staple food resources, such as fish, shrimp, wild chickens, wild ducks, wild rabbits, etc. This not only improves the lives of commune members, but also increases cash income. Baoying County, based on the characteristics of abundant fish, shrimp, and wild ducks in the local area, proposed that winter sideline production should first serve current life. The Wanzhuang team of the Yuechan Brigade of the Wangzhi Commune in this county organized eight skilled fishermen. Since the end of last month, they have been catching 70 to 80 catties of fish and shrimp every day. On average, each person eats two to four taels of fish and shrimp, and sells more than 600 catties to the state, drying and storing more than 300 catties. Other areas with less water and fewer fish and shrimp focus on hunting and other sideline occupations.

    Starting from the favorable development of sideline production, Yangzhou Special District counties have, in accordance with the specific conditions of each locality, fully discussed and studied the policy boundaries for the division of operations, distribution of income, and handling of products among communes, brigades, teams, and commune members at all levels, and have made several specific regulations respectively to mobilize the enthusiasm of brigades, teams, and the broad masses of commune members. Xinghua County stipulated that non-stocked water surfaces, regardless of size or boundaries, should be open to everyone for fishing, and whoever catches it gets it. This immediately formed a mass movement to engage in fishing during spare time, and the county's aquatic product output increased more than twofold. The fertilizer accumulation team of more than 120 people at the Gaoyou County Forest and Seedling Farm, after the opening of the water surface, combined mud dredging with fish catching and dry ditch fertilizer accumulation with fish catching. In half a month, they caught more than 3,000 catties of fish.

    (Our report) In Anhui's Anqing Special District along the Yangtze River and lakes, the opportunity of the current recession of inland rivers and lakes is being seized to build barriers to strenuously catch mature fish. At present, the total fish production in the region has reached more than 50 million catties, and the average daily output has increased from 120,000 catties in late November to 210,000 catties.

    Anqing Special District has many lakes, and winter is the peak fishing season. The fishery teams of various state-run aquaculture farms and fish-producing communes in Anqing Special District, in light of the life habits of mature fish "autumn leaving and winter hibernation," have been building barriers at lake mouths and river mouths since the beginning of autumn, building and catching at the same time to prevent mature fish from flowing away with the water. After the beginning of winter, various localities have specifically carried out encirclement and capture, thus significantly increasing the amount of fish caught compared to the past. Pengcheng Lake in Zongyang County has 30,000 mu of water. In the past, no barriers were built, and large numbers of mature fish flowed into the river every time the water receded after autumn. This year, Anfeng, Zongyang, Chengguan and other communes along the lake jointly established a barrier fishing committee. After erecting a 120-meter fish barrier at the lake's outlet, the efficiency of fishing increased twice as much compared to the past. Huaining County divided the county into three cooperation zones and found more than 140 key fish sources to carry out encirclement and capture, and the county's fish production increased significantly.

    Various localities have also universally reformed fishing gear and improved fishing methods in catching mature fish in order to achieve the goal of "catching more fish during the peak season, increasing production without increasing personnel." According to incomplete statistics from Wangjiang, Zongyang, Huaining and other counties, more than 150 kinds of fishing gear have been reformed recently, and the efficiency has generally increased by one to four times. There are also many new creations in fishing methods. Koukou Commune, a key fish-producing area in Wangjiang County, promoted the "three-layer hook fishing" method created by fishing expert Hu Yiqing (that is, changing the past one-layer fishing to three layers of fishing on the surface of the water, in the water, and at the bottom of the water), which increased efficiency fourfold. The Xiachongyang Fishery Brigade in Zongyang County vigorously promoted the reform movement of "four reforms" and "four combinations" (that is, changing small nets to large nets, shallow nets to deep nets, manual netting to winch netting, and low-yield operations to high-yield operations; and combining shallow water operations with deep water operations, combining fixed berths with mobile fishing, combining large fishing gear with small fishing gear, and combining the organization of large-scale fish-trapping arrays with the blitzing of guarding important locations on all sides). After the reform movement, the potential of tools, labor, and aquatic resources was fully tapped, and the annual fishing plan was completed two and a half months ahead of schedule, and the fish output increased by 86% compared to the same period last year.

    扬州专区因地制宜挖掘副食品资源
    安庆专区沿江沿湖拦河扎箔捕鱼虾
    本报讯　入冬以来，江苏扬州专区各级党委，就抓住冬闲的大好时机，发动群众，因地制宜地开展副业生产运动。目前，全区投入副业生产的劳力已达四十三万人，占总劳力的21％；从11月上旬以来，已经完成冬季副业产值七百六十多万元，刈柴草二亿二千多万斤，比去年同期增加了一倍，捕鱼的日产量也比10月份翻了一番。
    扬州专区各地在冬季副业生产中，充分挖掘副食品资源，如鱼、虾、野鸡、野鸭、野兔等等，这既使社员改善生活，又能增加现金收入。宝应县根据本地鱼虾多、野鸭多的特点，提出了冬季副业生产首先要为当前生活服务。这个县的望直公社月蛅大队万庄小队，组织八名捕捞能手，从上月底以来，每天都捕鱼虾七、八十斤，平均每人每天除吃二两到四两鱼虾以外，还出售给国家六百多斤，晒干贮存三百多斤。其它地区水面少，鱼虾少的，则以打猎等其他副业为重点。
    扬州专区各县从有利发展副业生产出发，按照各地的具体情况，对公社、大队、小队和社员各级之间的经营分工、收益分配、产品处理等政策界限，经过充分讨论和研究，分别作出了若干具体规定，以调动大队、小队和广大社员的积极性。兴化县规定非放养的水面，不分大小，不分境界，一律开放，人人都可捕捞，谁捕谁得以后，立即形成了群众性的利用业余时间大搞捕捞的运动，全县水产产量猛增一倍以上。高邮县林苗场一百二十多人的积肥专业队，在水面开放后，结合罱泥夹鱼，结合干沟积肥取鱼，半个月的时间，就取鱼三千多斤。
    本报讯　安徽安庆专区沿江沿湖地带，抓紧当前内河湖泊水退时机，拦河扎箔，大力捕捞成鱼。目前全区已累计产鱼五千多万斤，平均日产量由11月下旬的十二万斤提高到二十一万斤。
    安庆专区湖泊众多，冬季是捕鱼旺季。安庆专区各国营养殖场和产鱼公社的渔业队，针对成鱼“秋走冬藏”的生活习性，从入秋后，就普遍在湖口、河口扎箔，边扎边捕，防止成鱼随水流走；在入冬以后，各地专门进行围捕，因而使捕鱼量较过去显著增长。枞阳县有三万亩水面的蓬城湖，以往不扎箔，每当秋后退水时就有大批成鱼流到江里。今年沿湖的安凤、枞阳、城关等公社联合成立了扎箔捕鱼委员会，在该湖出水口扎起一百二十多米的拦鱼箔后，使捕捞工效比过去增加两倍。怀宁县将全县划分为三个协作区，找出一百四十多处重点鱼源进行围捕，全县产鱼量显著增长。
    各地在捕捞成鱼中，还普遍改革渔具和改进捕捞方法，以实现“旺季多捕鱼，增产不增人”的目的。仅据望江、枞阳、怀宁等县的不完全统计，最近就改革渔具一百五十多种，工效一般提高一倍到四倍。在捕捞方法上也有很多新的创造。望江县重点产鱼区的?口公社推广了捕鱼能手胡义清创造的“三层挂钓”法（即将过去一层钓改为水面、水中、水底三层钓），提高工效四倍。枞阳县下枞阳渔业大队大搞“四改”、“四结合”（即小网改大网，浅网改深网，人力起网改起网机起网，低产作业改高产作业；和浅水作业与深水作业相结合，固定埠位与流动捕捞相结合，大型渔具与小型渔具相结合，组织大兵团迷鱼阵与四处分兵把口的突击捕捞相结合）的改革运动以后，充分挖掘了工具、劳力和水产资源的潜力，提前两个半月完成了全年的捕鱼计划，鱼产量比去年同期增长86％。（附图片）
