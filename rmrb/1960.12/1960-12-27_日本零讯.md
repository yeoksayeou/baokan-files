　　Japanese Snippets

　　Government Plans to Change "Defense Agency" to "Ministry of Defense"

　　In order to step up military expansion and war preparations in accordance with the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, the Director-General of the "Defense Agency" of the Ikeda government, Naoki Nishimura, openly instructed the "Defense Agency" to draft a plan to upgrade the "Defense Agency" to the "Ministry of Defense."

　　According to the "Tokyo Shimbun," Nishimura Naoki also said that he would change the names of some of the Japanese military's equipment to "correct" names. In order to conceal the fact that Japan possesses combat forces prohibited by the constitution, the Japanese government has always given some weapons strange names, such as calling tanks "special vehicles." Nishimura's remarks show that the Japanese government will restore the original names of weapons and equipment in the future, and blatantly expand its combat strength regardless of the prohibitions of the constitution.

　　More Than 5,000 Fascist Groups Nationwide

　　According to materials released by the Japanese National Police Agency on the 25th, there are currently approximately 5,200 fascist groups across Japan, with approximately 120,000 participants.

　　The materials released by the Police Agency stated that from January to October of this year alone, 62,000 criminal cases involving fascist elements were cracked, an increase of approximately 8% compared to last year. Five thousand pieces of weapons were confiscated, including 173 handguns.

　　Ruling Party Bribery in Elections Sets Unprecedented Record

　　The bribery scandals of the Liberal Democratic Party, the ruling party of Japan, are being exposed one after another.

　　According to incomplete statistics released by the Japanese National Police Agency on the 17th, a total of 11,722 incidents of violating election laws occurred in this general election, an increase of 20% compared to the previous general election, setting an unprecedented record. A total of 24,919 people were detained or arrested for violating election laws, one and a half times more than in the previous general election. Moreover, most of them are members of the Liberal Democratic Party.

　　The "Asahi Shimbun" published the names of 20 people who violated election laws. Except for one Democratic Socialist Party member, all were Liberal Democratic Party members, including the current Minister of Justice in the Ikeda government, Kōjirō Ueki, the current Minister of International Trade and Industry, Etsusaburo Shiina, and the former Deputy Prosecutor-General of the Supreme Public Prosecutors Office, Yoshihiro Kishimoto.

　　Police Station Personnel Participate in Memorial Service for Murderer

　　According to the "Tokyo Shimbun," public security personnel from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department recently openly attended the memorial service for Otoya Yamaguchi held by a fascist group at the Hibiya Public Hall, wearing mourning badges, and sent condolences under the name of "enthusiasts." Yamaguchi was the murderer who assassinated Socialist Party leader Inejiro Asanuma.

　　Banji Kinoshita, a professor at Tokyo University of Education, pointed out in the "Tokyo Shimbun" on the 16th that this incident proves that the police are colluding with right-wing groups.

    政府要把“防卫厅”改为“国防省”
    为了根据日美军事同盟条约加紧扩军备战，池田政府“防卫厅”长官西村直己公然指示“防卫厅”拟订一项把“防卫厅”升格为“国防省”的方案。
    据“东京新闻”报道，西村直己还说，他要把日本军队的一些装备的名词改成“正确的”名称。日本政府为了掩盖日本拥有宪法所禁止的作战力量的事实，一直给一些武器起些古怪的名称，例如把坦克叫作“特车”。西村的谈话表明日本政府今后将恢复武器装备原来的名称，不顾宪法的禁止，明目张胆地扩充作战实力。
    全国现有法西斯团体五千多个
    据日本警察厅二十五日公布的材料说，日本全国现有约五千二百个法西斯团体，参加的约十二万人。
    警察厅公布的材料说，仅从今年一月到十月期间被破获的法西斯分子的犯罪案件，就达六万两千起，比去年增加约百分之八。被没收的凶器有五千件，其中有一百七十三支手枪。

    “朝日新闻”发表了二十名违反选举法的人的名字，其中除了一名是民主社会党议员以外，全是自由民主党议员，包括池田政府现任法务相植木庚子郎、现任通商产业相椎名悦三郎、前最高检察厅次长岸本义广。
    警局人士参加凶犯追悼会
    据“东京新闻”报道，东京警视厅公安人员最近公然带着丧章出席了法西斯团体在日比谷公会堂举行的山口二矢追悼会，并以“有志者”名义送了奠仪。山口二矢是杀害社会党领袖浅沼稻次郎的凶犯。
    东京教育大学教授木下半治在十六日的“东京新闻”上发表谈话指出，这件事情证明警察是与右翼团体有勾结的。
