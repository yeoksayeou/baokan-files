    Manufacturing Small Parts from Waste Tinplate
    Workers at the Dresden Turbine Factory enthusiastically responded to the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany's call for conserving raw materials, saving materials worth 72,000 marks in July and August.
    The rational cutting of tinplate proposed by welder Peter and foreman Jerimowitsch has been promoted. Waste tinplate scraps that used to be sent to the scrap heap are now being used to manufacture smaller parts. According to statistics from June, July, and August, a total of 22,950 kilograms of boiler iron were saved.

    利用白铁下脚料制造小零件
    德累斯顿涡轮机厂职工热烈响应德国统一社会党中央委员会关于节约原材料的号召，在7、8两月中节约了价值七万二千马克的材料。
    焊工彼得和工长耶里莫维奇提出的合理剪裁白铁皮的建议得到了推广。过去被送进废料堆去的白铁皮下脚料也被用来制造较小的零件。据6、7、8三个月的统计，总共节约了二万二千九百五十公斤锅炉铁皮。
