Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 9th: Vientiane Radio broadcast this morning that the Committee for Peace and Neutrality, National Harmony, and Unified Nation issued a statement condemning Kouprasith Abhay for creating riots in Vientiane, and condemning the United States and Thailand for interfering in Lao internal affairs and supporting the rebel group.

The statement pointed out that on December 8th, a group of rebels headed by Colonel Kouprasith staged riots in the capital Vientiane, attempting to usurp power, overthrow the Souvanna Phouma government, allow the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak group to establish a dictatorial system, and undermine the negotiations between the Phouma government and the Lao Patriotic Front, destroying the peace and neutrality policy of the Lao Royal Government.

The statement also pointed out that the riots created by the Kouprasith rebel group were caused by the blatant interference of the United States and Thailand. They have helped the Phoumi rebel group in all aspects.

The statement said that therefore, the Committee for Peace and Neutrality, National Harmony, and Unified Nation condemns the actions of foreign countries interfering in Lao internal affairs and supporting rebel groups to overthrow the legitimate government to all peace-loving countries in the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 9th: Vientiane Radio published a commentary on the 9th, exposing that US imperialism supplied its lackey in Laos, the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique, with a large number of modern weapons to attack the Lao Royal Government's army.

The commentary revealed that the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group's army, which has been launching attacks on the Lao Royal Government army along the Kading River south of Phonsavan since the end of November, used a large number of American-made weapons, such as American-made M24 tanks, a large number of 105mm American-style artillery pieces, and a large amount of ammunition. There were also helicopters for the rebel group's artillery to correct the target of bombardment against the government army.

The commentary further revealed that the United States directly sent military personnel to help the Lao traitorous group attack the Lao Royal Government army. The commentary listed the facts that after the 830-type reconnaissance aircraft was shot down while conducting reconnaissance over the Kading River, it was found that there were four Americans in the plane. When the rebel group's army attacked south of the Kading River, the American "advisors" sat in American jeeps to inspect.

The commentary said that the "United States Information Service" in Luang Prabang even helped the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group carry out reactionary propaganda. The radio station used by the rebel group was even directly located inside the "United States Information Service" in Luang Prabang.

The commentary also revealed that the Thai reactionary government allowed the Lao traitorous group's troops to enter Thai territory, provided them with supplies, and fired artillery from Thai territory at the Lao government army. The commentary said that the Thai government and the Philippine government also sent technicians to work for the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group. At the same time, Chiang gang planes hired by foreign agencies airdropped ammunition, supplies, and troops for the Lao traitorous group near North Kading on December 5th. (Attached picture)

    声明指出，12月8日，以库·帕西上校为首的一撮叛军在首都万象制造暴乱，企图篡夺政权，推翻梭发那·富马政府，让富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞集团建立独裁统治制度，并破坏富马政府同老挝爱国战线党之间的谈判，破坏老挝王国政府的和平中立政策。
    声明还指出，库·帕西一撮叛乱分子制造的暴乱，是由于美国和泰国明目张胆的干涉所造成的。它们曾经从各方面帮助富米叛乱集团。
    声明说，因此，争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会向全世界爱好和平各国谴责外国干涉老挝内政、扶植叛乱集团来推翻合法政府的行动。
    新华社河内9日电　万象电台在9日发表评论，揭露美帝国主义供给它在老挝的走狗富米·诺萨万叛国集团大量现代化武器，用来进攻老挝王国政府的军队。
    评论揭露，从11月底以来就在北汕南面卡定河沿岸向老挝王国政府军发动进攻的富米·诺萨万叛国集团的军队使用了大量的美式武器。如美国制造的M24型坦克、为数甚多的一零五毫米的美式大炮和大量弹药。还有为叛乱集团的炮兵校正向政府军轰击的目标的直升飞机等。
    评论进一步揭露说，美国还直接派遣军事人员帮助老挝叛国集团进攻老挝王国政府军。评论列举事实说，八三零型侦察机在卡定河南面上空进行侦察时被击落后，发现飞机里有四名美国人。在叛乱集团的军队向卡定河南面进攻时，美国的“顾问”就坐在美国吉普车上进行视察。
    评论说，在琅勃拉邦的“美国新闻处”甚至帮助富米·诺萨万叛国集团进行反动宣传。叛乱集团使用的电台甚至直接设在琅勃拉邦的“美国新闻处”里面。
    评论还揭露泰国反动政府允许老挝叛国集团的部队进入泰国领土，向他们提供物资，并从泰国的领土上以炮火向老挝政府军轰击。评论说，泰国政府和菲律宾政府还派遣了技术人员为富米·诺萨万叛国集团效劳。同时，被外国机关雇用的蒋帮飞机12月5日在北卡定附近为老挝叛国集团空投弹药、物资和部队等。（附图片）
