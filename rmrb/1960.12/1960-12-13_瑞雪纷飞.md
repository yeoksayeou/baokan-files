    Auspicious Snow Flying
    Leng Jie
    “Three million jade dragons were fought back, defeated scales and broken armor fly all over the sky.” These two lines of poetry by Zhang Yuan of the Song Dynasty vividly depict a magnificent scene of snow flying all over the sky. People also call snowflakes "goose feathers" or "willow catkins." On the surface, the metaphors are very appropriate and accurate. When a snowflake is placed under a magnifying glass, one will see that the shape of a snowflake is far more beautiful than we imagine. It can be said that each snowflake is an exquisite and superb pattern. Soviet scientists have observed at least 15,000 different shapes of snowflakes under a microscope, and the vast majority of them are based on six petals.
    Why six petals? It turns out that when water vapor in the high altitude freezes due to cold, it first forms tiny ice crystals. These ice crystals are all elongated hexagonal prisms or hexagonal thin slices. Water vapor continues to freeze on the edges and corners of the ice crystals, giving birth to new branches and twigs, which in turn give birth to small branches and twigs, eventually transforming the ice crystals into snowflakes with six petals. Because the water vapor content of the air layers through which the snowflakes pass is different, none of their shapes are absolutely symmetrical, and there are always deformed areas to be found.
    Snow makes a great contribution to mankind, especially to agriculture, and it is directly related to the harvest of crops in the coming year. People often say, "A timely snow promises a good harvest," and "No snow in winter, wheat will not set." According to measurements, newly fallen snow on the ground is loose and porous, containing as much as 40%-50% air gaps. Air does not easily transmit heat, so the snow layer has the wonderful effect of keeping warm and preventing cold, just like a down comforter. When the snow is as deep as a foot, even if the temperature drops to minus 30 degrees Celsius, the wheat will not suffer from frost damage. Under the snow cover, the soil freezes to a shallow depth, and substances such as leaves and grass roots can continue to rot into fertilizer; snow can also freeze to death the eggs of overwintering pests such as locusts and rice borers, and the earlier the snow falls, the stronger the insecticidal power. After the spring, the melted snow seeps into the ground, like watering with frozen water, which is beneficial for spring plowing and sowing. Although the density of snow is generally not large, in cold regions and polar regions, snow can become an excellent building material - it can be used for building roads and houses. When cars cannot drive fast due to slippery roads, a specially made horse-drawn sleigh runs happily. The famous Soviet polar explorer, Babannin, also invented building houses with "snow concrete." Just dig a hole in the ice surface, and sprinkle a lot of snow into it, stirring as you sprinkle, and it becomes dense and moist "concrete." Fill this "concrete" into the template, and it will solidify into an incomparably strong snow wall in a while.
    After each snowfall, you will feel that the air is particularly fresh and refreshing, because the dust and miscellaneous bacteria floating in the air all settle to the ground with the snowflakes. People breathe particularly comfortably, their resistance to bacteria is enhanced, many viruses are frozen to death, and pathogens are therefore reduced. This is very beneficial to human health.
    In the weather of auspicious snow falling, when you think of these contributions of snow, you will surely think with a kind feeling: snow is a product of nature, a close friend of mankind. We will eventually master it and make it create the greatest wealth for the happiness of mankind.

    瑞雪纷飞
    冷洁
    “战退玉龙三百万，败鳞残甲满天飞。”宋人张元这两句诗形象地描绘出一幅漫天飞雪的壮丽景色。人们也管雪花叫“鹅毛”或“柳絮”。从表面上看，比喻得都很恰当确切。当把雪花摆在放大镜下，就会看到雪花的形状远比我们想象的要美丽得多，可以说，每一片雪花都是一件精美卓绝的图案。苏联科学家用显微镜至少观测过一万五千种不同形状的雪花，其中绝大多数雪花都以六个花瓣为主体。
    为什么是六瓣呢？原来当高空中的水蒸汽在遇冷冻结时，先形成细小的冰晶。这种冰晶都是长六棱体或六角形的薄片。水蒸汽陆续在冰晶的棱角上冻结，生出了新的枝叉、枝叉上再生出小枝叉；最后使冰晶变成为有六个花瓣的雪花。由于雪花所通过的空气层水蒸汽含量不同，所以它的形状没有一个是绝对匀称的，总能找出畸形的地方。
    雪对人类有很大的贡献，特别和农业关系更为密切，它直接关系着来年农作物的收成。人们常说：“瑞雪兆丰年”、“冬无雪、麦不结”。据测量，新降落地面的积雪疏松多孔，竟含有40％—50％的空气间隙。空气不易传热，使得积雪层具有保暖防寒的妙用，恰似一床鸭绒被。当积雪深达一尺时，即便气温降低到摄氏零下三十度，小麦也不会遭受冻害。在雪被的复盖下，土壤冻结深度浅，树叶、草根等物质能继续腐烂变成肥料；雪还能冻死蝗虫、螟虫等过冬害虫卵，雪下得愈早，杀虫力愈强。开春后，融化的雪花渗进地里，就像浇了一次冻水，对春耕播种都有好处。雪的密度一般虽不大，但在严寒地区和极地，雪就能成为优良的建筑材料——能用于筑路和盖房。当汽车因路滑不能快速行驶时，一种特制的马拉雪撬却跑得正欢呢。苏联著名极地探险家巴巴宁还发明了用“雪花矻”建筑房屋。只要在冰面上凿一个洞，并撒进大量的雪，随撒随搅拌，变成了质密湿润的“矻”。把这种“矻”填入模板内，一会就凝固成坚固无比的雪墙了。
    每逢雪后，会感觉到空气特别新鲜、清爽，原因是浮游在空气中的灰尘、杂菌都随雪花沉落地面。人呼吸起来分外舒畅，抵抗细菌的能力增强了，许多病毒被冻死了，病原因此得到减少。这对人的健康大有益处。
    在瑞雪纷纷的天气里，想起雪的这些贡献时，你定会怀着一种亲切的心情想到：雪是大自然的产物，是人类的挚友。我们终将掌握它，使它为人类的幸福创造出最大的财富。
