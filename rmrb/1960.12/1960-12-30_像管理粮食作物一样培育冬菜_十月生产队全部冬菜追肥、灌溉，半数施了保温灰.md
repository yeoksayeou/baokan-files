Cultivating Winter Vegetables Like Managing Grain Crops
The October Production Team Top-Dresses and Irrigates All Winter Vegetables, Half Apply Warming Ash

(Our Dispatch) The October Production Team of the October People's Commune in Xishui County, Hubei Province, while carefully managing overwintering grain and oil crops, has adopted the policy of "the mess hall plants and the mess hall harvests," focusing on the cultivation and management of overwintering vegetables by calculating the vegetable needs. To date, all of the team's 150+ mu of winter vegetables have been weeded once, top-dressed once, and watered twice; 30% have been weeded twice and top-dressed twice; and 50% have been applied with warming ash manure to protect the vegetables and ensure they safely overwinter.

The October Production Team's sub-teams have planted 150+ mu of winter vegetables, with 90+ mu in vegetable bases and 50+ mu intercropped in the fields, all based on the mess halls. To ensure planting and harvesting, and to prepare sufficient vegetables for next year's spring plowing season, the Party branch proposed the slogan of focusing on the cultivation and management of winter vegetables, striving for winter vegetables to surpass autumn vegetables. At that time, some cadres and members believed that this year's autumn harvest was plentiful, so careless management of winter vegetables would not be a big deal; some believed that winter vegetable seedlings are dormant in winter, so management could wait until spring. In response to these ideological situations, the Party branch convened a meeting of cadres and member representatives, conducting ideological education by calculating the vegetable needs and through typical comparisons of managing winter vegetables versus not managing them. In the typical comparisons, everyone recalled that last year, the Seventh Sub-team's six mu of winter vegetables, due to good weeding and top-dressing, remained full and strong even with snow and ice. After spring, the various vegetables grew quickly, ensuring that the members had enough vegetables to eat during the spring plowing season, boosting member morale and making production fast and good. The Second Sub-team's twelve mu of vegetables, due to a failure to keep up with weeding and top-dressing, experienced some deaths due to snow and ice, and those that survived were yellow, thin, old, and weak. During spring production, there was a shortage of vegetables, and the members had complaints, which somewhat affected production. After everyone calculated the team's current autumn vegetable inventory, they realized that if winter vegetables are not well managed, there will still be a shortage of vegetables after spring. Through this work, everyone's ideological understanding was improved, and they quickly took action. Wang Youwang, the captain of the Third Sub-team, personally led five or six members after the meeting, and in one day, they weeded and top-dressed all five mu of winter vegetables, and also scattered ash manure on some frost-sensitive vegetables to keep them warm.

To further stimulate the enthusiasm of the sub-teams and members in managing winter vegetables, the production team implemented the method of "the mess hall plants, the mess hall harvests, the mess hall eats, and the surplus vegetables are entirely handled by the mess hall itself." In addition to consuming and storing a large amount of vegetables, the mess halls throughout the production team sold more than 253,000 jin of fresh vegetables to the market, generating an income of more than 22,000 yuan in cash. From this money, the mess halls allocated some cash to the sub-teams to purchase commercial fertilizers and kitchen utensils, and also distributed some cash to the members according to their labor work points. This further stimulated the members' enthusiasm for managing winter vegetables. The Seventh Sub-team mess hall, in addition to assigning four dedicated laborers to manage the six mu of winter vegetables, also had agricultural laborers voluntarily take time to help with urgent tasks.

While managing the basic vegetable plots well, they adopted a method of division of labor between professional vegetable teams and agricultural laborers to manage the intercropped vegetables in the fields. According to the situation, the professional teams were responsible for the vegetable bases, and the agricultural laborers took time to manage the intercropped vegetable fields, so that the agricultural laborers cultivated vegetables while managing grain and oil crops. The agricultural laborers of the Fifth Sub-team not only did a good job in cultivating and managing grain crops, but also did a good job in cultivating and managing vegetables. They only took two and a half days to weed and top-dress all five mu of intercropped vegetable land, and in addition to weeding, they top-dressed the four mu of basic vegetable land twice.

    像管理粮食作物一样培育冬菜
    十月生产队全部冬菜追肥、灌溉，半数施了保温灰
    本报讯　湖北浠水县十月人民公社十月生产队，在细心管理越冬粮食和油料作物的同时，采取算蔬菜需要账，固定专班劳力，贯彻执行食堂种食堂收的政策，狠抓越冬蔬菜的培育管理。到目前止，全队一百五十多亩冬菜普遍锄了一道草，追了一次肥，浇了两次水；有30％锄了两次草，追了两次肥；有50％施了保温的灰粪，保护蔬菜安全越冬。
    十月生产队各小队，以食堂为单位种了一百五十多亩冬菜，其中蔬菜基地九十多亩，大田套种五十多亩。为了保种保收，为明年春耕生产季节备足蔬菜，党支部提出抓好冬菜培育管理，力争冬菜超秋菜的口号。当时部分干部和社员认为，今年秋菜丰收了，冬菜管理马虎点没有大关系；有的认为冬菜苗在冬季是休眠时期，等开春后再管理也不迟。党支部根据这些思想情况，召开了干部和社员代表会议，通过算蔬菜需要账和冬菜管与不管的典型对比，进行思想教育。在典型对比中，大家回忆起七小队去年冬天六亩冬菜由于锄草追肥搞得好，下雪起凌也保持了苗全苗壮，开春以后各种菜长得很快，保证了春耕大生产时社员有足够的菜吃，社员生产劲头高，生产搞得又快又好。二小队十二亩蔬菜，由于锄草追肥没有跟上，落雪起凌，菜苗有的死了，没有死的也黄瘦老弱，春天大生产时缺菜吃，社员有意见，生产也受了一些影响。经过大家算了全队当前秋菜库存账，使大家认识到，如果冬菜管不好，开春后蔬菜还是会不够吃。通过这些工作，提高了大家的思想认识，很快行动起来。三小队队长汪有旺开会以后，亲自带领了五、六个社员，一天时间将五亩多冬菜全部锄了草，追了肥，对有些不耐冻的菜还撒了灰粪保温。
    为了更进一步激发小队和社员管理冬菜的积极性，生产队执行了那个食堂种、那个食堂收、那个食堂吃、多余的菜完全由食堂自己处理的办法。全生产队各食堂除自食和储藏了大量蔬菜外，还向市场上出售了二十五万三千多斤鲜菜，收入现金二万二千多元。这些钱各食堂除抽出部分现金交小队购买商品肥料和食堂添置炊具以外，还按照劳动工分给社员分了部分现金。这样就更加激发了社员们管好冬菜的积极性。七小队食堂的六亩冬菜除抽了四个专门劳力进行管理外，农业劳力还主动抽空帮助突击。
    在管好基本菜地的同时，他们采取了专业蔬菜队伍和农业劳力分工负责的办法管好大田套种的菜。根据情况专业队伍专管蔬菜基地，农业劳力抽空兼管大田套种的菜地，这样农业劳力在搞粮食、油料作物管理的同时就带着培育了蔬菜。五小队的农业劳力既搞好了粮食作物的培育管理，又搞好了蔬菜的培育管理，只用了两个半天时间，五亩多套种蔬菜的地全部进行了锄草追肥，四亩多基本菜地除了锄草外又追了二次肥。
