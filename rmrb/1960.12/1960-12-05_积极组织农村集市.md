Editor's Note:

    In the realm of commodity circulation, we must not only strengthen the state-owned commercial sector's acquisition and supply of industrial and agricultural products, but also be adept at utilizing the form of rural market trade in order to better organize commodity circulation and invigorate the urban and rural economy.
    “Three-level ownership, with the production team as the foundation” is the fundamental system of rural people's communes at the present stage. Not only between the state and the commune, and between communes, but even between production teams and even production groups, is there a need for necessary commodity exchange and adjustment through the form of commodity circulation. The products of commune members' private plots and the commodity-oriented portion of household sideline production will also participate in the scope of commodity exchange. Although these scattered commodities account for a small proportion of the overall market commodity exchange, they have an extremely wide variety and are exchanged very frequently.
    The "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1958 pointed out that people's communes must not only develop self-sufficient production to meet the needs of the commune itself, but also extensively develop commodity production, and, according to their own characteristics, under the leadership of the state, carry out production division and commodity exchange with other communes and state-owned enterprises. Actively organizing and leading rural market trade can not only better meet the requirements of production teams and commune members to sell certain commodities they produce and buy back certain commodities they need, but also help promote the development of the entire social economy.

    积极组织农村集市
    在商品流通领域中，既要加强国营商业部门对工农业产品的收购和供应，又要善于利用农村集市贸易这一形式，以便更好地组织商品流通，活跃城乡经济。
    “三级所有，队为基础”，是现阶段农村人民公社的根本制度。不仅国家与公社、公社与公社之间，就是生产队甚至生产小队之间，都需要通过商品流通的形式进行必要的商品交换和调剂；社员自留地的产品和家庭副业生产的商品性部分，也将参加到商品交换的范围中来。这些零星商品在整个市场的商品交换中虽然所占比重不大，品种却极为繁多，交换次数也很频繁。
    一九五八年中共八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中，就曾经指出：人民公社既要发展满足本社需要的自给性生产，又必须广泛地发展商品性生产，并根据自己的特点，在国家领导下，同别的公社和国营企业实行生产分工和商品交换。积极组织和领导农村集市贸易，既可以更好地满足生产队和社员出售自己生产的某些商品和买回自己所需要的某些商品的要求，更有利于促进整个社会经济的发展。
