Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 15th: The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement today regarding the grave situation in Laos, strongly condemning the blatant acts of aggression against the Lao people by US imperialism and its lackey, the reactionary Thai clique.

The statement said that in order to turn Laos into its own military base and colony, US imperialists have long engaged in various threats and interventions against the Kingdom of Laos government and have consistently and systematically fostered Lao people's traitors to act as their pawns.

US imperialists provide the Lao people's traitor and their pawn, the Phoumi Nosavan group, with various weapons and ammunition, and directly command them to expand the war of aggression in Laos.

The statement pointed out that this action by US imperialism is a blatant violation of the Geneva Agreements on Indochina, a premeditated and overt aggression against Laos, a challenge to the people of Asia and the world, and a grave threat to world peace and security. All these facts once again clearly prove that US imperialism is the ferocious enemy of peace and national independence and the arch-criminal of imperialist aggression.

The statement said that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the entire Korean people resolutely condemn the blatant interference and aggression by US imperialists and the reactionary Thai regime against Laos, and strongly demand that US imperialism and its lackeys immediately withdraw their claws from Laos. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the entire Korean people fully support the Lao people's just struggle.

The statement said that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea fully supports the position of the governments of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, participants in the Geneva Conference on Indochina, regarding Laos. If US imperialists, disregarding the opposition and protests of the Korean people and the people of the world, continue to carry out their war of aggression against the Lao people, they must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 16th: A rally of more than 1,200 people was held in Pyongyang tonight at the Cinema Actors' Theatre to support and express solidarity with the Lao people's struggle against the aggression of US imperialism and its lackeys.

Among those attending the rally were: DPRK Vice Premiers Hong Myong-hui and Chong Il-ryong, Vice Chairmen of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea Park Jung-ae and Kim Chang-man, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea Li Guk-ro, Chairman of the Presidium of the Fatherland Front Kim Chun-hae, President of the Korean Academy of Sciences Baek Nam-un, and heads of various social organizations, well-known figures from all walks of life, etc.

Han Seol-ya, Chairman of the Korean National Peace Committee and Chairman of the Korean-Asian-African Solidarity Committee, spoke at the meeting, severely condemning the crime of US imperialism's armed intervention in Laos.

He said that the Korean people fully support the Lao people's struggle against the armed intervention of US imperialism and to defend national independence. The Lao people's struggle is linked to the Korean people's struggle to drive US imperialism out of South Korea.

Han Seol-ya said that US imperialism has bared its fangs in Laos, proving that it is the enemy of the people of the whole world, and once again illustrating that the aggressive nature of US imperialism will not change.

Also speaking at the rally were representatives of workers, peasants, youth, students, and figures from the scientific, cultural, and artistic circles. They unanimously angrily condemned the act of armed intervention in Laos by US imperialism.

    据新华社平壤15日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省今天就老挝的严重局势发表声明，严词谴责美帝国主义及其走狗泰国反动集团对老挝人民进行的露骨的侵略行为。
    声明说，美帝国主义者为了把老挝变为自己的军事基地和殖民地，从很久以前就开始对老挝王国政府进行各种威胁和干涉，并一直有计划地豢养老挝人民的叛徒充当自己的走狗。
    美帝国主义者提供给老挝人民的叛徒、它的走狗——富米·诺萨万集团以各种武器和弹药，并直接指挥他们在老挝扩大侵略战争。
    声明指出，美帝国主义的这种行动是对关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协议的粗暴的违反，是对老挝进行的蓄谋已久的露骨的侵略，是对亚洲和世界人民的挑战，是对世界和平和安全的严重威胁。这一切事实又一次清楚地证明，美帝国主义是和平和民族独立的凶恶的敌人、是帝国主义侵略的元凶。
    声明说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民坚决谴责美帝国主义者和泰国反动政权对老挝的粗暴的干涉和侵略，并强硬要求美帝国主义及其走狗立即从老挝缩回它们的魔掌。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民完全支持老挝人民的正义斗争。
    声明说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府完全支持关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议参加国——苏联、中华人民共和国和越南民主共和国政府对老挝立场。如果，美帝国主义者不顾朝鲜人民和全世界人民的反对和抗议，继续进行反对老挝人民的侵略战争，就必须对由此而造成的一切后果负完全责任。

    他说，朝鲜人民完全支持老挝人民反对美帝国主义的武装干涉、保卫民族独立的斗争。老挝人民的斗争是同朝鲜人民从南朝鲜赶走美帝国主义的斗争连结在一起的。
    韩雪野说，美帝国主义在老挝露出了它的狼牙，证明了它是全世界人民的敌人，并且再一次说明美帝国主义的侵略本性是不会改变的。
    在大会上讲话的，还有工人、农民、青年学生和科学、文化、艺术界的代表。他们一致愤怒地谴责美帝国主义武装干涉老挝的行为。
