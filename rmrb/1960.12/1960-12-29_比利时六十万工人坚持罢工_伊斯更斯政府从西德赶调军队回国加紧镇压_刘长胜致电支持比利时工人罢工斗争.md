Xinhua News Agency, December 28th, Brussels Dispatch: Twenty thousand striking Belgian workers held a large demonstration in the southern Belgian industrial town of La Louvière on the 27th, expressing their determination to persist in their struggle against the government's reactionary economic policies. According to estimates by Belgian Socialist Party figures, the number of strikers nationwide has reached 600,000.

On the same day, 7,000 people also held a demonstration in Brussels, the capital of Belgium. This was a rally of Belgian workers, displaying their indomitable spirit in the face of the government's intensified suppression through troop deployments. Workers in Brussels posted many slogans on trams, buses, and lampposts, which read: "The austerity bill is a bill of suffering."

In Mons, a coal mining center in the province of Liège, striking workers erected roadblocks on major highways. In this area, all coal mines, as well as steel, chemical, and cement factories, have completely ceased operations. It is reported that in Liège, the provincial capital of Liège province, an industrial center, not a single chimney is smoking, and not a single crane is working in the layers of factories within a 24-kilometer radius.

Workers in Flanders drove dozens of locomotives that were still running back to the depot on the evening of the 26th. Butchers in the capital, Brussels, also joined the ranks of the strikers.

The Eyskens government is intensifying its suppression of striking workers. Seven hundred Belgian troops stationed in West Germany have been ordered to return home, and reservists have been called up to suppress the workers. Near Brussels, armed police even opened fire on striking workers yesterday, injuring several people. Now, trucks full of troops are constantly patrolling the streets of the capital. The authorities have also dispatched helicopters to cooperate with the military police in setting up heavy posts in the city center. Western news agencies say that it will "soon present a military camp scene."

These reactionary measures by the government have aroused even greater anger among the working class and the broad masses of the people. Under pressure from the masses, in Wallonia, the French-speaking region of southern Belgium, approximately four hundred mayors have had to refuse to implement the Ministry of the Interior's instructions to compile a blacklist of municipal employees participating in the strike.

Xinhua News Agency, December 28th: Liu Changsheng, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, sent a telegram to Reynaers, Deputy General Secretary of the Belgian General Federation of Labor, on the 27th, expressing that the Chinese workers deeply sympathize with and resolutely support the heroic struggle of the Belgian working class against the reactionary "economic austerity plan" and to defend the vital interests of the workers.

In his telegram, Liu Changsheng wished the Belgian workers to strengthen solidarity and achieve victory in their struggle.

    比利时六十万工人坚持罢工
    伊斯更斯政府从西德赶调军队回国加紧镇压
    刘长胜致电支持比利时工人罢工斗争
    新华社28日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：两万名比利时罢工工人27日在比利时南部工业重镇拉鲁维尔举行大示威，表示坚持斗争反对政府的反动经济政策的决心。据比利时社会党人士估计，全国罢工人数已达六十万人。
    同一天，在比利时首都布鲁塞尔，七千人也举行了示威游行。这是比利时工人在政府调兵遣将加紧镇压的面前，表示他们威武不屈的誓师大会。布鲁塞尔的工人在电车、汽车和路灯柱上贴了许多标语，标语上写道：“节约法案是苦难的法案。”
    在列日省的煤矿中心蒙斯，罢工的工人在主要公路上筑起了路障。在这个地区，所有煤矿以及钢铁、化学和水泥工厂已全部停工。据报道，在列日省省会列日市这个工业中心，方圆二十四公里内层层叠叠的工厂中，没有一家的烟囱冒烟，也没有一架起重机在工作。
    佛兰德省的工人26日晚把数十辆仍在行驶的火车头开回车库。首都布鲁塞尔屠宰工人也参加了罢工的行列。
    伊斯更斯政府正在加紧镇压罢工的工人。七百名驻在西德的比利时军队已奉调回国内并且征召后备兵入伍，以便镇压工人。在布鲁塞尔附近，武装警察昨天甚至对罢工工人开枪，使得好几个人受了伤。现在，满载军队的卡车在首都大街上不断来回巡逻。当局还出动直升飞机，配合军警在市中心区布下重重岗哨。西方通讯社说，那里“很快就呈现出一个军营的景象”。
    政府的这些反动措施，激起了工人阶级和广大人民更大的愤怒。在群众的压力下，在比利时南部操法语的华伦地区，有大约四百名市长不得不拒绝执行内政部关于开列参加罢工的市政府职员的黑名单的指示。
    新华社28日讯　中华全国总工会副主席刘长胜27日打电报给比利时总工会副总书记雷纳，表示中国工人十分同情与坚决支持比利时工人阶级为反对反动的“经济节约计划”和保卫工人切身利益所进行的英勇斗争。
    刘长胜在电报中祝比利时工人在斗争中加强团结，取得胜利。
