Liu Huanzhi is an excellent automobile driver from the No. 1 Automobile Team of the Tangshan City Transportation Bureau. The average monthly vehicle-tonnage production of the car he drives reached more than 37,000 ton-kilometers, and he saved more than 13,000 liters of gasoline in ten months.

Liu Huanzhi often thinks: To save fuel, we must start with high yields. He constantly researches ways to improve towing capacity with veteran workers. The towing capacity of the car he drives has quadrupled compared to the past, carrying much more cargo with the same amount of gasoline.

Liu Huanzhi pays close attention to the maintenance of his vehicle, avoiding fuel waste due to poor maintenance. Whenever the car is loading or unloading goods, he always carefully inspects the vehicle, adjusting the oil and electrical circuits to ensure uniform fuel injection during driving...

The car he drives has achieved high yields for every vehicle, daily fuel savings, and over-fulfillment of the national plan every month.

    争高产  重保养
    刘焕墀是唐山市交通运输局汽车一队的优秀汽车司机。他驾驶的汽车平均车吨月产达到三万七千多吨公里，十个月节约的汽油有一万三千多公升。
    刘焕墀经常想：要节约燃料，必须从高产着手。他不断和老工人一起研究提高拖挂能力。他驾驶的汽车的拖载能力已经比过去提高了四倍，用同样多的汽油多拉了许多货物。
    刘焕墀很注意保养车辆，避免因为保养不好而浪费汽油。每当汽车装卸货物时，他总是详细检查车子，调整油路、电路，保证行车时喷油均匀……。
    他驾驶的车子已经作到车车高产、日日节油，月月超额完成国家计划。
