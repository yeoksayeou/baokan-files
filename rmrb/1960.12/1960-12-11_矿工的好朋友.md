    The Miner's Good Friend
    Zhou Fengqin, a food delivery worker at the Cai Tun Coal Mine in Benxi, always remembers what the Party Branch Secretary said: "Delivering food to the mine shows the Party's concern for the workers. If the food delivery work is done well, the workers will feel the warmth of the Party even more." For more than a year, she has always followed the Party's teachings, carrying hot meals to the workface in the mine on time. The workers say: "Little Zhou has a warm heart, and the food is hot too."
    During the intense labor competition, Zhou Fengqin noticed that although the meals were delivered to the workface, the miners still had to climb out of the main work area to eat, which wasted a lot of their rest time. Wouldn't it be better for the workers to rest if the meals could be delivered into the workface and handed directly to them? She told the Party Branch about this idea. The Party Branch considered that she had been delivering food for several months, was familiar with the conditions in the mine, and understood the safety regulations, so they agreed to let her deliver the food into the workface. Soon after, all the food delivery workers in the mine were doing this, greatly benefiting the workers.

    矿工的好朋友
    本溪彩屯煤矿送饭员周凤琴，时刻记着党支部书记的话：“送饭到井下，体现了党对工人的关怀，送饭员的工作搞好了，就越能使职工体会到党的温暖。”一年多来，她总是按照党的教导，按时背着热饭热菜送到井下掌子口。工人们说：“小周心热饭也热。”
    在火热的劳动竞赛中，周凤琴看到饭菜虽然送到了掌子口，但是矿工们还是要爬出大掌子来吃饭，耽误不少休息时间，如果把饭菜送进掌子面交到工人手里，不是更有利于工人休息吗？她把这想法告诉党支部，党支部考虑到她已经送了几个月饭，熟悉了井下情况，懂得安全规程，就同意她把饭送进掌子去。不久以后，矿上所有的送饭员都这样做了，大大便利了工人。
