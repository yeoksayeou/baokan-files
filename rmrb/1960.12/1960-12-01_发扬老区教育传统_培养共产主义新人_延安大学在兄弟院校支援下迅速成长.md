    Carrying Forward the Educational Tradition of the Old Revolutionary Base Areas, Cultivating New Communist People
    Yan'an University Grows Rapidly with the Support of Brother Institutions
    (By our newspaper) Yan'an University, under the leadership of the Party and with the strong support of nearly a hundred brother institutions, has overcome the numerous difficulties of its early establishment through its own hard work and has grown rapidly. Now, all teachers, students, and staff members are full of vitality and confidence, continuously improving the quality of teaching and forging ahead steadily.
    Yan'an University was established in 1958. The campus is located in Yangjialing, Yan'an, where the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao lived. It has five departments: Medical, Mathematics, Chinese, Physics, and Chemistry.
    At the time of its establishment, due to the short preparation time, the school's teachers, teaching equipment, and other resources could not meet the needs of teaching. Brother institutions in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Fuzhou, and Xi'an, upon learning of this situation, immediately provided comprehensive support in terms of human resources and materials. Higher education institutions in Beijing alone provided more than 60,000 books, 103 kinds of teaching instruments, and several teachers in one instance. Among them, spark-type vacuum measuring machines and other instruments were very valuable. At the same time, Peking University, Shanghai First Medical College, and Northwest University also helped Yan'an University train twenty-seven young teachers. Nankai University, Fudan University, Zhejiang Medical College, and other institutions warmly received teachers and cadres from Yan'an University who came to visit and learn. They also took the time to hold various symposiums, providing detailed introductions to the experiences in Party committee leadership, teaching reform, and student life management. Nanjing First Medical College, Shandong University, and other institutions repeatedly worked with teachers from Yan'an University to study the teaching and tutoring content of various courses and jointly formulate teaching syllabi.
    In order to better support Yan'an University, Xi'an Medical College proactively signed a five-year contract with Yan'an University, specifically responsible for the professional settings, teacher training, textbook supply, and all teaching staff currently needed for the Medical Department of Yan'an University.
    In supporting Yan'an University, brother institutions always treated the difficulties of Yan'an University as their own and tried their best to help solve them. Beijing Normal University, upon hearing that Yan'an University lacked analytical balances, immediately sent its best one. When the Medical Department of Yan'an University needed anatomical specimens for dissection experiments, Sichuan Medical College promptly sent ten anatomical specimens from its inventory. Xi'an Jiaotong University even opened its warehouse and said to the cadres of Yan'an University: "Whatever Yan'an University needs, we will support it." Higher education institutions in Beijing and Shanghai not only provided books and instruments but also took responsibility for packaging and paid for the transportation, sending them thousands of miles away.
    The teachers, students, and staff of Yan'an University, encouraged by the communist spirit of brother institutions, worked even harder, paying attention to using the achievements supported by brother institutions and doubling their efforts to run the school well. They regarded the books, instruments, and other teaching aids supported by brother institutions as the most precious gifts, marking each item with the name of the donating unit, taking good care of them, and making full use of them to improve the quality of teaching. At the same time, the teachers, students, and staff of Yan'an University paid more attention to taking the communist spirit of brother institutions as an example, insisting on implementing the instructions of the Yan'an Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China: "Carry forward the educational tradition of the old revolutionary base areas and cultivate new communist people." When the school was first established, there was nothing but two rows of old cave dwellings. The teachers, students, and staff, based on the principle of running the school diligently and thriftily, built the school by themselves through labor. Lacking classrooms, they dug earth, burned lime, and worked with workers to build more than 400 houses in two years. Without a teaching farm or factory, they worked on their own, and in a few months, they reclaimed a farm and established five factories. When there were not enough teaching tools, they made sulfuric acid, radios, ground bone slices, etc. The new teachers were many and lacked teaching experience, so all members of the school's Party committee went deep into the teaching and research groups, studied lesson preparation with the young teachers, personally helped revise lecture notes, and attended classes to listen. Under the care of the Party committee, the teachers worked hard and were enthusiastic, and they were very serious about preparing and rehearsing lessons. When teacher Yang Dehu was preparing for the lesson "The Production Policy of the People's Commune," he studied it several times in the teaching and research group and took the lecture notes to ask Li Huigui, deputy secretary of the Party committee, to review them. Deputy Secretary Li said: "I will invite the members of the Party committee, and you can treat us as students and give us a rehearsal first!" In the original Central Auditorium, Yang Dehu took the stage to give a rehearsal. After the lecture, the members of the Party committee pointed out what he did well and what he did not do well. Yang Dehu spent another week revising the lecture notes. When he didn't understand some of the questions in the revision, he ran to ask Bai Zhiming, first secretary of the Yan'an Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, until he understood. In this way, the teachers' ideological level and professional ability were rapidly improved. Now, the courses in the four departments of Chinese, Mathematics, Chemistry, and Physics can all be taught by themselves.
    Because the school is run with the spirit of communism, the teachers, students, and staff have developed a hardworking and simple style. All one hundred and seventy-eight graduates of the specialized courses this autumn happily obeyed the state's assignment and went to work in remote areas. (Attached picture)

    发扬老区教育传统　培养共产主义新人
    延安大学在兄弟院校支援下迅速成长
    本报讯　延安大学在党的领导下，在近百所兄弟院校的大力支援下，经过自己的艰苦努力，克服了建校初期的重重困难，迅速成长起来。现在，全校师生员工生气勃勃，信心百倍，不断提高教学质量，健步前进。
    延安大学是1958年成立的。校址在党中央和毛主席住过的地方——延安杨家岭。设有医疗、数学、中文、物理、化学等五个系。
    这所学校在建校时，由于筹备时间短，师资、教学设备等都不能满足教学的需要。北京、上海、天津、广州、沈阳、南京、杭州、福州和西安等地的兄弟院校，知道了这种情况后，立即从人力、物力等方面给予全面的支援。仅北京的高等院校，一次就支援了六万多册图书、一百零三种教学仪器和若干名教师。其中火花式真空勘测机等，都是很贵重的仪器。同时，北京大学、上海第一医学院和西北大学，还帮助延安大学培训二十七名青年教师。南开大学、复旦大学、浙江医科大学等院校，都热情地接待了来本校参观访问的延安大学的教师和干部，并且抽出时间，召开各种座谈会，向来访者详尽地介绍了党委领导、教学改革、学生生活管理等方面的经验。南京第一医学院、山东大学等院校，都曾多次同延安大学教师在一起研究各门课程的教学和辅导内容，共同制定教学大纲。
    为了更好地支援延安大学，西安医学院主动与延安大学签订了五年包干合同，具体负责延安大学医疗系的专业设置、师资培养、教材供给以及当前教学所需的全部教职员工等。
    在支援延安大学中，各兄弟院校总是把延安大学的困难当作本校的困难，竭力帮助解决。北京师范大学听说延安大学缺少分析天平，立刻送来了最好的一架。延安大学医疗系进行解剖实验，没有解剖标本，四川医学院就把库存的十个解剖标本及时地送来。西安交通大学甚至打开仓库对延安大学的干部说：“延安大学需要什么，我们就支援什么。”北京、上海等地的高等院校不但支援了图书、仪器，还负责包装，出了运费，千里迢迢送上门去。
    延安大学师生员工，受到兄弟院校这种共产主义风格的鼓舞，干劲更大，注意运用兄弟院校支援的成果，加倍努力办好学校。他们把兄弟院校支援的图书、仪器和其他教学用具，视为最珍贵的礼物，逐件标明赠送单位的名称，妥善保管，充分用它来提高教学质量。同时，延安大学师生员工更加注意以兄弟院校的共产主义精神为榜样，坚持贯彻中共延安地委的指示：“发扬老区教育传统，培养共产主义新人。”学校初办时，除了两排旧窑洞外，一无所有。师生员工本着勤俭办学的原则，自己动手，劳动建校。缺少教室，自己挖土方、烧石灰、与工人一道，在两年时间内修建了四百多间房屋。没有教学农场和工厂，就自己动手，几个月功夫，就开垦出一个农场，办起了五个工厂，教学用具不够用，自制了硫酸、无线电、磨骨片等。新教师多，缺乏教学经验，学校的全体党委委员就深入教研组，和青年教师一起研究备课，亲自帮助修改讲稿，到课堂听讲。在党委的关怀下，教师们干劲大，热情高，备课试讲都非常认真。教师杨德虎准备“人民公社的生产方针”一课时，在教研组研究了几次，又拿着讲义请党委副书记李棬桂审阅。李副书记说：“我把党委委员们请来，你就把我们当学生，先试讲一遍吧！”在原中央大礼堂，杨德虎登台试讲。讲毕，党委委员们提出他什么地方讲得好，什么地方讲得不好。杨德虎又花了一周时间修改了讲义。修改中有些问题弄不懂，又跑去请示中共延安地委第一书记白志明。直到弄懂。就这样，教师们的思想水平和业务能力得以迅速提高。现在，中文、数学、化学和物理等四系的课程，都能自己开课。
    由于用共产主义的精神来办学校，广大师生员工养成了艰苦朴素的作风。今秋毕业的一百七十八名专科学生，人人都愉快地服从国家分配，到边远地区工作。（附图片）
