Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, December 16th. The "Cambodia Telegram" published a commentary today stating that Prince Sihanouk's third official visit to China "is a new contribution to strengthening the fraternal and profound friendship between the Kingdom of Cambodia and the People's Republic of China."

The commentary stated, "The Sino-Cambodian friendship, built on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, has been continuously developed since Prince Sihanouk and Premier Zhou Enlai established initial contact in the name of their respective countries during the historic Bandung Conference in 1955. Premier Zhou Enlai has also made two official visits to Cambodia. Cultural and economic exchanges between the two countries have also been developing at a rapid pace."

The commentary said that the Chinese Chaozhou Opera Troupe had successful performances in various provinces of Cambodia, Chinese technical experts are working in Cambodia's four major factories and the national radio station, and many Cambodian youths are studying technology in China. The commentary stated, "The Chinese assistance to our enormous economic construction program is deeply appreciated by the Khmer people, just as they appreciate all the selfless assistance from other friendly countries."

The commentary pointed out, "Normal relations between our two countries were established in the distant historical period, and over the years these relations have become very close. It is true that our two countries do not follow the same path in the political sphere, and the social and economic structures are also different. It is true that China is a vast country, while Cambodia is a small country. It is true that China has now become one of the world's giants, far exceeding the possibilities that traditional Western countries can achieve. However, these do not fundamentally hinder the strengthening of friendly ties between our two countries. Sino-Cambodian friendship now stronger than ever. Prince Sihanouk's third visit is a new contribution to the productive and effective development of this solid friendship. This solid friendship vividly demonstrates the relationship that can exist between countries with different systems."

    加强中柬深厚友谊的新贡献
    《柬埔寨电讯报》评西哈努克亲王访华
    新华社金边16日电　《柬埔寨电讯报》今天发表评论说，西哈努克亲王这次对中国的第三次正式访问，“是对加强柬埔寨王国和中华人民共和国之间的亲如兄弟的深厚友谊的新的贡献”。
    评论说，“建立在和平共处五项原则基础之上的中国—柬埔寨友谊，自从西哈努克亲王和周恩来总理以各自的国家的名义1955年在历史性的万隆会议期间建立了初步接触以来，得到了不断的发展。周恩来总理也曾经对柬埔寨进行了二次正式访问。两国之间的文化和经济的交流也不断以很快的速度发展起来。”
    评论说，中国潮剧团在柬埔寨各省进行了成功的演出，中国的技术专家正在柬埔寨的四个大工厂以及国家广播电台工作，许多柬埔寨青年正在中国学习技术。评论说，“中国对我们的巨大的经济建设计划的帮助，深深受到高棉人民的感激，正如他们感激其他友邦的一切无私援助一样。”
    评论指出，“我们两国之间远在遥远的历史时期就建立了正常的关系，而若干年来这些关系已变得非常亲切。诚然，我们两国在政治领域方面不是遵循同一条道路，社会和经济结构也有所不同。诚然，中国是一个幅员辽阔的大国，而柬埔寨则是一个小国。诚然，中国目前已经成为世界巨人之一，大大超过传统的西方国家所能达到的可能性。但是，这些根本不妨碍在我们两国之间加强友好联系。中国—柬埔寨友谊现在比以往任何时候更加坚固。西哈努克亲王的第三次访问，是对这种坚固的友谊的有成果和有效的发展的新的贡献。这种坚固的友谊生动地表明了不同制度国家之间可能存在的关系。”
