    The couple at the Livestock Farm
    Sheng Ru, Zhang Xin
    Wang Shiquan, a tobacco-curing worker at the Huangyan Tobacco Processing Factory in Lintao County, Gansu Province, actively responded to the Party's call this August and requested to settle down in the countryside to participate in agricultural production. One evening, Wang Shiquan told his wife, Liu Shulan, about his plan, and Liu Shulan was also very willing. Soon, with the approval of the organization, the couple happily brought their children to the Shangjie Production Team of the Xindian People's Commune in Lintao County.
    The cadres and members of the team warmly welcomed them. The next day, Wang Shiquan ran to the team headquarters, asking to start working immediately. The cadres still advised him to rest for two days and tidy up his home, but he said, "The team's work is so busy, let us participate in the labor."
    The pig farm of the Shangjie Production Team had ten large sows. Due to the lack of feeding experience and responsibility of the feeders, someone needed to take over immediately. In addition, there were more than seventy chickens that also needed someone to take care of. The team cadres said, "Raising pigs and looking after chickens are two troublesome things, and somewhat dirty. We don't know if you are willing to do this work." Wang Shiquan said very happily, "That's great. Please rest assured, we don't haggle over work. As long as we can produce more grain, we will do any dirty or tiring work." That noon, the couple arrived at the livestock farm.
    The livestock farm was located in a small gully east of the village, which was somewhat remote, more than half a mile away from the village. In order to feed and take care of the pigs and chickens, they decided to move from the village to live at the livestock farm. The team cadres agreed with their opinion, but there were no houses at the livestock farm. They prepared to send some people to build a house for them, but Wang Shiquan declined again, saying, "The autumn harvest task is very tight now, and we can't delay everyone's time. Let's do it ourselves!" So the two of them, while feeding pigs and raising chickens, carried water and mud to build walls and a kang. They made do with whatever was available, and tried to use old and waste materials and other things to replace what was lacking. Without door frames and door panels, they repaired and installed an old set of door frames and door panels; without windows, they used adobe to separate a few grids and pasted newspapers to replace the windows. In this way, they built a new house using a shed originally used for storing firewood, and the family of three settled down here.
    The ten large sows at the livestock farm had tall and long skeletons, and two of them were pregnant, but they were all very thin and staggering when they walked. Wang Shiquan thought, "This is a great fortune for the commune! We must do everything possible to feed them quickly, produce more piglets, and accumulate more fertilizer." Liu Shulan also loved the seventy chickens very much. The two of them divided the work. Wang Shiquan was in charge of feeding the pigs, and Liu Shulan was in charge of raising the chickens.
    When the feed was not enough, Wang Shiquan tried every means to find feed. There was some four-leaf alfalfa in the fields that could not be used to feed livestock, so he took time to cut it back and chop it into short, fluffy pieces for the pigs to eat. After a few days, when the alfalfa was finished, he carried a basket to the vegetable fields to pick up vegetable leaves, picking up several back baskets a day. Later, after hearing that elm leaves were good for fattening pigs, he went to the trees every day to pick elm leaves. Originally, the dishwater in the canteen was poured away, but after Wang Shiquan found out, he discussed it with the cooks. After dinner every day, he felt his way in the dark to carry dishwater from three canteens, three or four loads a day, every day, regardless of wind or snow. After the team started threshing the autumn fields, he pulled a cart every afternoon to transport grain husks and corncobs from several threshing floors to store feed for the pigs to get through the winter. He transported it every time the team threshed, not letting anything be lost.
    Wang Shiquan not only actively and proactively found more feed for the pigs, but also carefully and meticulously fed the pigs food and water, and cared about the pigs' warmth. He fed them twice a day and grazed them once. In late autumn, when the weather turned cold, he first soaked the grain husks in water to soften them, then mixed them with grass and vegetables, put them in a pot to heat them, and then fed them to the pigs. When feeding the pigs, he adopted the method of frequent and small additions, so that the pigs ate more deliciously and abundantly. When giving them concentrated feed, he also adopted the method of giving less first and then more, so that the pigs ate more and were full each time. At noon, when the sun was bright, he drove them out to graze in the harvested potato fields and vegetable fields, letting the pigs bask in the sun while eating vegetable leaves. He was even more careful with the two pregnant sows, feeding them in separate troughs each time. Because Wang Shiquan fed them so carefully, in less than two months, the ten sows' fur was smooth, their color was moist, and their fat grew. As soon as they left the pigpen, they jumped and jumped. After the eight sows came into heat, the production team bought a boar, and soon all eight sows were bred. Like Wang Shiquan's careful pig-raising situation, Liu Shulan also managed and fed the seventy chickens very well. She searched east and west, swept the bottom of the threshing ground, sifted grain husks, and collected a lot of feed, cooked and mixed it well for the chickens to eat. She also drove the chickens to the wild once a day to eat grass seeds, so the chicks grew up and the big chickens were fattened. Several hens began to lay eggs again after winter. Whether feeding at home or grazing outside, she followed the chickens wherever they went. Except for eating and feeding the children, she rarely left the flock all day. Although there are many weasels and eagles here, none of the seventy chickens were harmed.

    饲养场的两口子
    生儒　张辛
    甘肃省临洮县黄烟加工厂的刨烟工人王士全，今年8月间积极响应党的号召，要求到农村去安家落户，参加农业生产。一天晚上，王士全把自己的打算告诉了爱人刘淑兰，刘淑兰也挺愿意。不久，他们夫妇俩经组织上批准，便带上孩子，愉快地来到临洮县辛甸人民公社新添铺大队上街生产队。
    队上的干部和社员们都热情地欢迎他们。第二天，王士全就跑到队部，要求马上干活。干部们还是劝他休息两天，把家里收拾整理一下，他说：“社里的活儿那么忙，还是让我们参加劳动吧。”
    上街生产队的猪场有十个大母猪，由于饲养员缺乏喂养经验，责任心也不够强，所以马上需要人去接替。另外，还有七十多只鸡，也需要有个人看管。队里干部说：“养猪看鸡是两件麻烦事，有些脏，不知你们愿不愿干这工作。”王士全非常高兴地说：“那太好啦，请放心，在工作上我们是不讲价钱的。只要能多打粮食，再脏再累的活我们都干。”当天中午，他们两口子就到了饲养场。
    饲养场是在村子东边的一个小山沟里，地方有些偏僻，离村子还有一里多路。为了把猪和鸡喂养看管好，他们决定由村里搬到饲养场去住。队里的干部同意他们的意见，但是饲养场没有房子，准备派几个人给他们盖一间房子，王士全又谢绝了，他说：“现在秋收任务很紧张，不能耽搁大家的时间，还是我们自己动手搞吧！”于是他们两个就一面喂猪养鸡、一面挑水和泥，砌墙盘炕。他们因陋就简，缺少的东西，就尽量利用旧物废物和其他东西代替。没有门框和门板，他们就把一副破旧的门框和门板加以修补安上；没有窗户，他们就用土坯隔上几个格子糊上报纸代替窗户。就这样，利用原来放柴草的一间棚子，盖起了一间新房子，一家三口就这样居住下来了。
    饲养场的十头大母猪，骨架又高又长，有两头还怀着小猪，但是一个个都非常瘦弱，走起路来摇摇晃晃。王士全想：“这是社里的一批大财富呀！一定要想尽一切办法，把它们很快喂肥，多产小猪、多积肥。”刘淑兰对七十多只鸡也很喜爱。他们俩分工，王士全管喂猪，刘淑兰管养鸡。
    饲料不够，王士全就千方百计想办法找饲料。地里有些四槎的小苜蓿喂不成牲口，他就抽空割回来，铡得短短绒绒的给猪吃。几天以后，苜蓿割完了，他又提上筐子到菜地拣菜叶子，一天拾回几背斗。以后听说榆叶喂猪爱长膘，他又天天上树摘榆叶。原来食堂里的洗锅水都倒了，王士全发现以后和炊事员商量好，每天吃过晚饭后，摸着黑到三个食堂去担洗锅水，一天三、四担，天天如此，风雪无阻。队上开始打碾秋田以后，他又每天下午拉着架子车，到几个打谷场上运谷衣子和玉米心，给猪贮备过冬的饲料，社员打一场，他运一次，一点都不让丢失。
    王士全不但积极主动地给猪找了更多的饲料，而且精心细致地给猪喂食喂水，关心猪的寒暖，每天喂两次，放牧一次。秋末天气冷了，他就先用水把谷衣浸软，然后和草、菜合在一起，放在锅里煮热，再给猪吃。喂猪时，他采取勤添少添的办法，让猪吃得又香又多。下精饲料时，他又采取先少给后多给的办法，每次猪都吃得多吃得饱。中午太阳红了，他又赶出去在收过的洋芋地和菜地放牧，让猪一面晒太阳，一面吃菜叶。对两头怀孕的母猪，他更是经心，每次都分槽喂养。由于王士全这样精心喂养，不到两个月，十个母猪的毛顺了，色润了，膘肉长起来了，一出圈门就蹦蹦跳跳。八个母猪发情后，生产队买了一个公种猪，不久八头母猪全配上了种。和王士全同志精心养猪的情况一样，刘淑兰对七十多只鸡也经管喂养得很好。她东寻西找，扫场底子、筛谷衣子，收拾了许多饲料，煮熟拌好给鸡吃。她每天还把鸡赶到野外吃一次草籽，所以小鸡长大了，大鸡喂肥了。有几个母鸡入冬以后又开始下蛋了。不管是在家喂食或者是出去放牧，鸡走到哪里，她就跟到哪里，除了吃饭和喂孩子以外，她一天很少离开鸡群。虽然这里黄鼠狼和老鹰很多，但七十多只鸡一个也没受害。
