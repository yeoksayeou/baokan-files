Italian Communist Party
    Xinhua News Agency, Rome, December 25th: The Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party recently held a meeting, at which it passed a resolution expressing its complete agreement with the documents adopted by the meeting of representatives of eighty-one Communist and Workers' Parties.
    The resolution pointed out: "These documents will guarantee and develop the correct orientation of the international communist movement. The Central Committee welcomes the strengthening of the unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties, as this is a testament to the strength of the international communist movement and a testament to the power of Marxist-Leninist theory."
    The resolution called on the entire party to strengthen the struggle for peace, for disarmament, and for peaceful coexistence, and pointed out the serious nature of the current Italian government's support for the US imperialist aims to establish a so-called "European atomic force" and its support for French colonialism. The resolution called on all party members to immediately participate in the struggle against the plans of fascism, colonialism, and Western European reactionaries, for the independence of Algeria, for the removal of foreign atomic bases from Italian territory, and for Italy to pursue a new foreign policy.
