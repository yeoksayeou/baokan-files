Yellow Well Water Turns Clear
Feng Qi, Member of Baoquan Commune, Kedong County, Heilongjiang

Comrade Yu Yongxiang was originally a cadre from our county's Bureau of Culture and Education. This year, he was sent down to our production team as a deputy leader. On the first day he came to our team, he participated in labor with everyone. In labor, he set an example, worked diligently, and was selected as a "Five-Good" member and a "Five-Good" cadre several times.

Once, when we were working together, he noticed that the boiled water sent by the cooks was always yellowish and had a fishy smell, indicating poor water quality. Yu Yongxiang thought: if the water quality is not improved, it will affect the health of the members and the progress of production. We must fundamentally change the water quality. So, he sought out some experienced farmers for repeated research and personally led the sent-down cadres and some members to treat the water. They were not afraid of the cold weather or the cold water. When there were no carpenters, they asked the old farmers for guidance and did it themselves; when there were no bricks, they made them themselves. In this way, in just a few days, they dug the well and built the well house. The water quality, which people had previously thought could not be changed, was changed under the leadership of Yu Yongxiang. From then on, the well water became clean, the yellow water turned white, and the fishy smell disappeared. Everyone praised: "Sent-down cadres come to our village, changing the water quality for the villagers, sand and gravel filter the water clean, clean and hygienic, truly beautiful."

    黄黄井水变清亮
    黑龙江克东县宝泉公社社员　冯奇
    于永祥同志，原来是我们县文教局的干部，今年下放到我们生产队当副队长。他来到我们队的头一天，就和大家一起参加劳动。在劳动中，他以身作则，埋头苦干，曾几次被选为“五好”社员和“五好”干部。
    有一次，我们在一起干活的时候，他看见炊事员送来的开水总是黄登登的，还有腥味，水质不好。于永祥想：水质不改变就会影响社员身体健康，影响生产的跃进，一定要从根本上改变水质。于是，他就找一部分有经验的农民反复进行研究，并亲自带领下放干部和部分社员治水。他们不怕天冷，也不怕水凉。没有木匠，他们就请老农作指导自己干；没有坯，就自己做。就这样，不几天的工夫他们就掏好了井，盖上了井房。过去一再被人们认为不能改变的水质，在于永祥的带领下改变了。从此，井水清洁了，黄水变白了，腥味没有了。大家赞扬说：“下放干部到咱庄，改变水质为老乡，砂石过滤水清净，清洁卫生真漂亮。”
