    Conscientiously Master Synthetic Ammonia Production Technology
    Wuhu Union Fertilizer Plant Handles Technical Issues Meticulously, Resulting in Steady Production Increase
    Hefei Jianghuai Fertilizer Plant Underestimated Difficulties and Neglected Project Quality, Taking a Detour
    Our Correspondent in Hefei, 14th December – Anhui Province’s Wuhu Union Fertilizer Plant has emphasized difficulties tactically, paying close attention to every specific issue in the production and construction of small synthetic ammonia plants, being very serious and meticulous. As a result, it quickly achieved normal production, with a steady increase in output. The Hefei Jianghuai Fertilizer Plant, also with an annual output of 800 tons of synthetic ammonia, due to the leadership's underestimation of the technical complexity of producing synthetic ammonia and neglect of project quality and equipment maintenance, was unable to produce normally after being put into production. Later, this factory accepted this lesson, thoroughly overhauled the equipment, and organized workers to seriously study the technology, and production gradually returned to normal.
    When the Wuhu Union Plant began construction, it proposed the slogan "Strategically, one should be considered as ten, tactically, ten should be considered as one," fostering in its workers the idea of ​​daring to think and dare to act, while also cultivating a pragmatic and conscientious spirit, not relaxing at any step, based on the technically complex nature of synthetic ammonia fertilizer plants. The plant did not have specialized quality inspectors. In order to improve installation quality, the plant leaders sent forty workers who had studied operation techniques at other factories to the installation team to inspect the quality of each set of equipment together with the installation workers. They carefully cleaned and pressure-tested all the synthetic ammonia equipment and pipelines. During the inspection of the installation quality of the coal gas conversion section, it was repeatedly inspected and pressure-tested twenty-one times until it fully met the standards before production began.
    During the trial run, due to the new workers and new equipment, unfamiliar operations, and inability to grasp equipment performance, the plant leaders mobilized the masses to concentrate their efforts on breaking through the "technical barrier." The refining section had complex operating conditions, requiring trace amounts of refining gas to reach a few parts per million, which was the key to overcoming the "technical barrier." The Party Committee Secretary, workshop leaders, section chiefs, operators, and maintenance workers referred to relevant materials, compared and studied them item by item, and analyzed and compared them based on the workshop's production records, conducting repeated experiments. After a month of exploration, they finally brought the trace amounts of refining gas up to the standard. In practice, the technical level of the workers improved rapidly. Now, 60% of the workers in the factory can skillfully master the operation of their positions, and 20% of the workers can master the overall work of their section.
    After this factory started normal production in September, its output increased month by month, reaching the design capacity, and creating the highest daily output record among small synthetic ammonia plants.
    When the Jianghuai Fertilizer Plant was built, the leading cadres did not sufficiently recognize the technical complexity of synthetic ammonia production and did not strictly follow technical requirements during construction and installation, which affected project quality. After being put into production, they failed to mobilize the masses to seriously address and promptly resolve the difficulties in production technology; nor did they allocate sufficient maintenance forces and spare parts, resulting in the factory not being able to produce normally for a long period after its completion. Later, the leading cadres of this factory recognized these problems and took active measures, concentrating superior forces to attack the technical barrier from four aspects: equipment installation, operation, enterprise management, and maintenance and repair. From the boiler room at the beginning of the production process to the final ammonia water section, every piece of equipment, pipeline, valve, joint, and even screw was carefully inspected and cleaned, and hundreds of valves on the equipment were individually ground and pressure-tested. The entire factory spent more than two months solving more than four hundred problems on equipment of all sizes one by one and carefully checked the quality. At the same time, production management was strengthened, and workers were organized to learn operating techniques. Now the factory's production has returned to normal.

    踏踏实实掌握合成氨生产技术
    芜湖联盟化肥厂对待技术问题一丝不苟产量稳步上升
    合肥江淮化肥厂低估困难忽视工程质量走了一段弯路
    本报合肥14日电　安徽省芜湖联盟化肥厂在战术上重视困难，对小合成氨厂生产建设中的一个个具体问题，十分认真，一丝不苟，结果很快地实现了正常生产，产量稳定上升。同是年产八百吨合成氨的合肥江淮化肥厂，由于领导干部对生产合成氨的技术复杂性估计不足，忽视工程质量和设备维护工作，结果投入生产后不能正常生产。后来这个厂接受了这段教训，彻底检修了设备，并且组织职工认真地学习技术，生产才逐步走上正常。
    芜湖联盟厂开始建厂时，就提出了“战略上以一当十，战术上以十当一”的口号，在职工中树立敢想敢作的思想，同时又培养职工踏实认真，根据合成氨化肥厂技术复杂的特点，步步都不放松的求是精神。厂里没有专门的质量检查员，为了提高安装质量，厂领导就把四十名在外厂学习过操作技术的工人派到安装队，和安装工人一起检查每套设备的质量。他们把合成氨设备、管线都认真进行了清洗、试压。在检查煤气变换工段安装的质量时，曾反复检查试压了二十一次，直到完全合乎标准后，才开车生产。
    在试车期间，由于是新人新设备，操作不熟练，设备性能掌握不住。厂领导便发动群众集中力量突破“技术关”。精炼工段操作条件复杂，精炼气微量要求达到百万分之几，是过“技术关”的关键。厂党委书记、车间领导干部、工段长、操作工人、维修工人，就参照有关资料，一条条地对照研究，根据车间生产纪录进行分析比较，反复试验。这样摸索了一个月，终于使精炼气微量达到了标准。在实践中，职工的技术水平迅速提高了，现在全厂已有60％的工人能熟练地掌握自己岗位的操作，有20％的工人能掌握本工段的全面工作。
    这个厂从9月份开始正常生产后，产量月月提高，达到了设计能力，并且创造了小合成氨厂中最高的日产纪录。
    江淮化肥厂在建厂时，领导干部对生产合成氨的技术复杂性认识不足，在建筑安装时没有严格按照技术要求办事，影响了工程质量。投入生产后又没有发动群众认真对待生产技术上的困难，及时解决；也没有配备足够的维修力量和备品备件，致使工厂在建成后，有较长的一段时间不能正常生产。后来这个厂的领导干部认识了这些问题，积极采取措施，集中优势兵力，从设备安装、操作、企业管理、维护检修四个方面围攻技术关。从生产过程开始的锅炉房到最后的氨水工段，对每项设备、管道、阀门、接头甚至螺丝钉，都作了认真的检查、清洗，对设备上的几百只阀门都一个个进行研磨试压。全厂用了两个多月的时间把大小设备上的四百多项问题一一解决，并认真检查了质量。同时，加强了生产管理工作，组织工人学习操作技术。现在这个厂生产已经正常。
