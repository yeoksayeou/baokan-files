    Rushing to Unload Coal Cars
    Since our team launched the increase production and practice economy campaign, we have been completing our loading and unloading tasks every month. Recently, the Party called on us again: "Guarantee the completion of transportation tasks and promote the increase of steel and coal production!" Our answer is: "Resolutely listen to the Party's words and vow to be the vanguards on the forefront of transportation!" On November 21st, the climate suddenly changed, first rain and then snow. We fought on the freight yard, facing the piercing north wind. When we finished our task and returned to the lounge to bake by the stove, we heard that another train of coal cars had arrived. We were all thinking: "This is an important cargo to support steel production, and we must not delay the unloading time!" So the whole team immediately tidied up their tools and rushed out of the lounge, braving the wind and snow to head to the freight yard. Everyone jumped onto the coal cars and got to work. The shiny black coal flowed down from the car bodies, and in just twenty-five minutes, a coal car carrying forty-five tons was emptied.

    抢卸煤车
    我们小组自从开展增产节约运动以来，一直是月月完成装卸任务。最近，党又号召我们：“保证完成运输任务，促进钢煤增产！”我们的回答是：“坚决听党的话，誓做运输最前线的尖兵！”11月21日，气候突变，先雨后雪。我们迎着刺骨的北风战斗在货场上。当我们完成任务回到休息室在炉旁烘烤的时候，听说又送进一列煤车。我们心里都在想：“这是支援钢铁生产的重要货物，决不能耽误卸车时间！”于是全组的人马上整理一下工具，就冲出休息室，冒着风雪走向货场。大家跳上煤车就干起来。黑晶晶的煤顺着车皮一流而下，仅仅经过二十五分钟，载重四十五吨的煤车就卸空了。
