How to Concentrate Efforts to Grasp the Main Links?
    In recent months, Shanghai's steelmaking production has shown a steady upward trend. Under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and with the enthusiastic support of coal and iron transfers from various regions, the Shanghai people resolutely implemented the policy of taking steel as the key link in industrial production for overall leap forward and concentrating efforts to ensure key points. The entire workforce on Shanghai's iron and steel front, driven by the excellent situation nationwide, further promoted the experience of organizing large-scale leap forward mass movements over the past two years, concentrating efforts to effectively solve various key issues in each period. This is the fundamental reason why Shanghai's steelmaking front has been able to achieve continuous significant results. The excellent situation on Shanghai's steelmaking front not only vividly illustrates that being good at using the leadership and working methods advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong of concentrating efforts to grasp the main links and fighting battles of annihilation is the key to victory in production and construction, but also provides us with successful experience in how to concentrate efforts to grasp the main links.
    What is Shanghai's main experience?
    One of the main experiences is that leading cadres must go deep into production and have a thorough understanding of production. Concentrating efforts to grasp the main links and fighting battles of annihilation means concentrating the energy of the leadership and concentrating the wisdom and strength of the masses and cadres to seize the links that are decisive to the overall situation. It also means seizing the main contradictions, winning complete and quick victories in one battle, so as to quickly free up hands to seize another link and solve another contradiction. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Without a general idea of the overall situation, one cannot really make a good move." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume 1, p. 216) He also said: "Leaders at any level should focus their attention on those problems or actions that are most important and decisive for the overall situation they command, and not on other problems or actions." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume 1, p. 169) This is an extremely important aspect of leadership art and also the key to whether or not victory can be achieved. However, to make this good move, the leadership must go deep into reality, conduct a comprehensive analysis of objective things, not only to find out the various contradictions in the development of things at that time, but also to find out the main contradiction that plays a decisive role; not only to see the overall contradiction, but also to see the various aspects of the contradiction; not only to see one by one contradiction, but also to see the internal connections between them. In Shanghai's steel production increase campaign, the first concentration of efforts to improve the desulfurization rate and melting rate of iron smelting furnaces was determined only after the leading comrades of the Municipal Party Committee and the leading comrades of the metallurgical department conducted a thorough investigation and comprehensive analysis of the requirements for steel production and quality, the capacity of steelmaking and iron smelting furnaces, the quantity and quality of pig iron supply, and the technical conditions of various links, and accurately identified the key to a substantial increase in steel production.
    Without going deep into production practice, just standing by and looking at it, seeing a little bit of the superficial contradictions in a rough and careless way, and having no understanding or a half-baked understanding of the actual production, it is impossible to grasp the main contradictions in production development in a timely and accurate manner. When the main contradiction or the main aspect of the contradiction begins to transform in the movement, one cannot stand at the forefront of the movement and be a guide to the masses. If you can't grasp the main contradictions, you can't correctly determine what is the central task, what is the non-central task, what is the key point, what is the non-key point, what should be done urgently, and what should be done slowly. This is like stretching out five fingers and hitting randomly, lacking both strength and failing to hit the target you want to hit.
    Once the situation is judged clearly and the main contradictions are accurately grasped, it is necessary to truly concentrate the strength and use it most effectively. To this end, a strong and unified leadership must be established. This is Shanghai's second main experience in fighting battles of annihilation in steelmaking. The steel production process has many links, strong continuity and collaboration, and many "neighbors." The situation changes rapidly, and often the entire work will be affected due to a malfunction in a certain part or a failure to follow up on a certain measure. Only strong centralized leadership and unified command can coordinate the pace of all parties. Shanghai's approach is to establish a unified headquarters for the city, led by the secretary of the Municipal Party Committee in charge of industry, and to set up joint offices in various major economic departments, with counterpart connections at all levels. This kind of centralized leadership, unified command, coordinated actions from top to bottom and left to right, not only tightly grasps the main links, but also better arranges the tasks of other links and other departments around the main links and central tasks, so that the primary and secondary, the important and light, the urgent and slow, each get their due place. Centralized leadership and unified command means organizing general work to serve the central work, and at the same time, driving other work through the central work. In Comrade Mao Zedong's words, this is called the leadership method of "playing the piano." Not only should one finger move, but all ten fingers should move, but the strength is not used equally, but there is a sequence, a priority, and a speed. Only in this way can a harmonious and melodious music be played.
    The third main experience on Shanghai's steelmaking front is to start with grasping political work and ideological work, and to firmly grasp this work from beginning to end. Concentrating efforts and unifying command is not just an organizational work, but more importantly, ideological work and political work. Whether it is improving the desulfurization rate and melting rate of iron smelting furnaces, extending the life of converters, transporting raw materials, or manufacturing and repairing metallurgical equipment and transportation equipment, it is necessary to rely on the workers and masses. The so-called concentration of efforts, in the final analysis, is mainly the concentration of the wisdom and strength of the masses. Both concentration and command must be based on the consciousness of the vast number of cadres and workers.
    To be good at concentrating efforts and truly exert its effectiveness in production, the most important thing is to make the guiding ideology of concentrating superior forces to fight battles of annihilation advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong be grasped by the vast number of cadres and masses, transformed into their own ideas, and turned into a huge material force. In this way, no matter how difficult the task is, they can proceed from the overall situation and maximize their enthusiasm. In every task of supporting steel production, Shanghai's relevant departments and enterprises have insisted on grasping ideology with one hand and grasping tasks with the other, and using ideological work to lead tasks. They talked to the workers about the situation, assigned tasks, and organized the workers to visit steel plants, so that the masses truly understood the principles of taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy and industry as the leading factor, as well as taking steel as the key link in industry, and understood that manufacturing a piece of equipment or a screw for key points, and transporting a ton of raw materials for key points, all had a vital relationship with themselves. In this way, the vast number of cadres and workers would not passively accept the task of collaboration, would not deal with it temporarily, and would not simply piece together manpower and material resources, but would fully promote the communist style and become an organized and led action. Under the guidance of the ideas of "only with steel can there be ships" and "only with steel can there be machines," the vast number of workers knew where there was a need, they went there to support, and when one party had difficulties, all parties cooperated, sending convenience to the furnace and leaving the difficulties to themselves. No matter which unit, when completing the task, they strived to do more rather than less, only better and not worse, rushing forward and not backward, taking responsibility for manufacturing, repairing, and using, and being truly responsible to the end. At the same time, taking advantage of the east wind of supporting key points, they carried out large-scale technical innovation and technical revolution, developed the comprehensive utilization of materials from all aspects, and unearthed potential from various aspects, resulting in many vivid and moving examples. A close collaboration network has been formed between steel enterprises and other enterprises. The workers on all fronts have one heart and one mind, which has made things that were originally impossible to accomplish in a short period of time possible and well done, and has also made work that was originally more difficult less difficult.
    The achievements made by Shanghai's steelmaking front are also inseparable from the strong support of the people in various places. Under the policy of taking steel as the key link in industrial production for overall leap forward and concentrating efforts to ensure key points, the vast number of workers in coal and iron bases in relevant provinces and cities across the country, with full energy, tried every means to increase production, and in accordance with the principle of prioritizing external support over internal needs, transferred a large amount of coal, iron, and various auxiliary materials to support Shanghai's key steel enterprises. This communist style of the vast number of workers in various places gave great encouragement to Shanghai's steel workers and the vast number of people, further stimulating their revolutionary enthusiasm and production enthusiasm, concentrating their efforts, and striving to refine more and better steel with the least amount of raw materials and roll out various steel materials to support the whole country. The victory of Shanghai's steelmaking front is also the result of concentrating efforts to fight battles of annihilation nationwide.
    The several experiences accumulated by Shanghai in the steelmaking movement are good experiences of the specific application of the working method of concentrating efforts to grasp the main links and concentrating superior forces to fight battles of annihilation advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong in socialist construction, and it has universal significance. Other places also have similar experiences and should also be summarized and promoted. Shanghai's experience is not only applicable to Shanghai, but also to other places; not only applicable to steelmaking, but also to other work.

### 怎样集中力量抓好主要环节？

    怎样集中力量抓好主要环节？
    近几个月来，上海市的炼钢生产一直呈现着稳定上升的局面。上海人民在中共上海市委的领导下，在各地调运煤铁的热情支持下，坚决贯彻了工业生产以钢为纲全面跃进、集中力量保证重点的方针；上海钢铁战线全体职工，在全国大好形势的推动下，进一步发扬两年来组织大跃进群众运动的经验，集中力量切切实实地解决了各个时期的各项关键问题。这就是上海炼钢战线能够连续取得重大成果的根本原因。上海炼钢战线上的大好形势，不仅生动地说明了，善于运用毛泽东同志提倡的集中力量抓好主要环节、打好歼灭战的领导方法和工作方法，是生产和建设中的致胜之道，而且给我们提供了怎样集中力量抓好主要环节的成功经验。
    上海市的主要经验是什么呢？
    主要经验之一，就是领导干部要深入生产，对生产要深知深解。集中力量抓主要环节，打歼灭战，就是集中领导的精力，集中群众和干部的智慧和力量，抓紧对全局具有决定意义的环节；也就是抓紧主要矛盾，一战而达到全胜和速决的目的，以便迅速腾出手来，再抓另一个环节，解决另一个矛盾。毛泽东同志说：“没有全局在胸，是不会真的投下一着好棋子的”。（《毛泽东选集》第一卷，二一六页）又说：“任何一级的首长，应当把自己注意的重心，放在那些对于他所指挥的全局说来最重要最有决定意义的问题或动作上，而不应当放在其他的问题或动作上。”（《毛泽东选集》第一卷，一六九页）这是领导艺术的一个极其重要的方面，也是能否取胜的关键。但是要投下这一着好棋子，领导就必须深入实际，对客观事物进行全面的分析，不但要把当时事物发展的各种矛盾找出来，还要把其中具有决定作用的主要矛盾找出来；不但要看到矛盾的总体，还要看到矛盾的各个侧面；不但要看到一个一个的矛盾，还要看到它们之间的内部联系。上海市在钢的增产运动中，首先集中力量提高化铁炉的脱硫率和熔化率，就是市委领导同志和冶金部门的领导同志，对钢的产量和质量的要求，对炼钢能力和化铁炉能力，对生铁供应的数量和质量情况，对各个环节的技术状况，都作了周密调查和全面分析，看准了大幅度增产钢的关键所在之后才确定下来的。
    不深入生产实践，仅仅站在旁边望一望，粗枝大叶地看到一点矛盾的皮毛，对生产实际不知不解或者半知半解，就不可能及时地准确地抓住生产发展中的主要矛盾；当主要矛盾或者矛盾的主要方面在运动中开始转化的时候，就不能站在运动的前头做群众的向导。捉不住主要矛盾，就无法正确确定什么是中心工作，什么是非中心工作，什么是重点，什么是非重点，什么是应当急办的，什么是应当缓办的。这就好比伸开五指乱打一气，既缺少力量，也打不中要打的目标。
    情况判断清楚了，主要矛盾抓准了，要把力量真正集中起来，并且最有效地加以使用，为此就必须建立强有力的统一领导，这是上海市在炼钢中集中力量打歼灭战的第二个主要经验。钢铁生产过程的环节多，连续性、协作性强，“左邻右舍”的关系多，情况变化迅速，往往由于某一个局部发生故障，或者由于某一个措施没有跟上，全部工作都会受到影响。只有强有力的集中领导，统一指挥，才能协调各方面的步伐。上海市的做法是全市成立统一指挥部，由市委管工业的书记挂帅，在各个主要经济部门设立联合办公室，层层对口挂钩。这样集中领导，统一指挥，上下左右，协同动作，既紧紧地抓主要环节，又更好地围绕主要环节、中心任务，安排其他环节和其他部门的任务，使主和次、重和轻、急和缓，各得其所。集中领导，统一指挥，就是要组织一般工作为中心工作服务，同时要通过中心工作带动其他工作。用毛泽东同志的话来讲，这就叫做“弹钢琴”的领导方法。不只要一个指头动，而且要十个指头都动，但又不是平均使用力量，而是有先有后，有重有轻，有快有慢。这样才能弹出一曲和谐悦耳的音乐来。
    上海市炼钢战线上的第三个主要经验，就是从抓政治工作、抓思想工作入手，并且自始至终抓紧这个工作。集中力量，统一指挥，不只是一个组织工作，更重要的是思想工作和政治工作。提高化铁炉的脱硫率和熔化率也罢，延长转炉炉龄也罢，运送原料材料也罢，制造和修理冶炼设备、运输设备也罢，都必须依靠职工群众。所谓集中力量，归根到底，主要地也是集中群众的智慧和力量。集中和指挥，都必须建立在广大干部和职工群众自觉的基础上。
    善于集中力量，并真正在生产上发挥效用，最重要的是使毛泽东同志提倡的集中优势兵力打歼灭战的指导思想，为广大干部和群众所掌握，变为他们自己的思想，变成巨大的物质力量。这样，不论是多么困难的任务，他们都能从全局出发，最大限度地发挥自己的积极性。上海有关部门和企业在每一项支援钢铁生产的任务中，都坚持做到一手抓思想，一手抓任务，并以思想工作带任务。他们向职工群众讲形势，交任务，组织职工群众去钢厂参观，使群众确实懂得国民经济以农业为基础、以工业为主导，以及工业以钢为纲的道理，懂得为重点制造一台设备、一颗螺丝钉，为重点运输一吨原料、材料，都跟自己有切身的利害关系。这样，广大的干部和职工群众就不会是被动地接受协作任务，不会是临时应付一下，也不会是把人力、物力简单地拼凑起来，而是充分地发扬共产主义风格，成为有组织有领导的行动。在“有钢才有船”、“有钢才有机器”等等思想指导下，广大职工知道哪里有需要，就到哪里支援，一方困难，四方协作，把方便送到炉前，把困难给自己留下；无论哪个单位，在完成任务的时候，都力求只多不少，只好不坏，都赶前不赶后，包制造，包修理，包使用，切实负责到底。同时借支援重点的东风，大搞技术革新、技术革命，开展物资的综合利用，从各个方面挖掘潜力，出现了许多生动感人的事例。钢铁企业和其他企业之间形成了这种紧密的协作网，各条战线上的职工一条心，一股劲，就使原来在短期内办不到的事情可以办到了，办好了，也使原来困难比较多的工作变成困难比较少的了。
    上海钢铁战线取得的成绩，也是和各地人民的大力支援分不开的。在工业生产以钢为纲全面跃进，集中力量保证重点的方针下，全国各有关省市的煤、铁基地的广大职工，鼓足干劲，千方百计，力争多增产，并且本着先外后内的原则，调运大量的煤、铁和各种辅助材料，支援上海重点钢铁企业。各地广大职工的这种共产主义风格，给上海钢铁职工和广大人民以极大的鼓舞，进一步激发了他们的革命热情和生产积极性，集中力量，努力以最少的原料材料，炼出更多的好钢，轧出各种钢材，支援全国。上海钢铁战线的胜利，也是在全国范围内集中力量打歼灭战的结果。
    上海市在炼钢运动中积累起来的这几条经验，是毛泽东同志提倡的集中力量抓主要环节、集中优势兵力打歼灭战的工作方法，在社会主义建设中具体运用的好经验，它具有普遍意义。别的地方也有类似的经验，也应加以总结推广。上海的经验，不只适用于上海，也适用于别的地方；不只适用于炼钢，也适用于别的工作。
