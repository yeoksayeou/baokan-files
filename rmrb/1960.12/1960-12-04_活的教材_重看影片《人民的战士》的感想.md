    ——Reflections on Re-watching the Film "People's Warrior"
    Chen Yading
    Recently, I had the opportunity to re-watch a batch of excellent films depicting our people's revolutionary war, such as "Southward and Northward," "Dong Cunrui," "People's Warrior," and "Red Eagle Spreading Wings." These films are all familiar to us, having been watched more than once. However, after studying Volume Four of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," re-watching these films gives me new feelings and many new insights, helping us absorb perceptual and living knowledge from the great revolutionary struggles of the people under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, thereby deepening our understanding of Chairman Mao's works. To confirm this point, I will talk about my feelings after re-watching "People's Warrior."
    In this film, the author focuses on shaping two characters in the People's Liberation Army in the Northeast region at that time. One is Wan Liangcai, a liberated peasant from the liberated areas. He is a completely new type of person, fighting to defend the fruits of victory, to defend the workers' and peasants' regime, and to liberate the suffering masses of the whole country. The brilliance of proletarian consciousness shines on this young soldier. The other is Liu Xing, an old soldier from the Kuomintang-controlled areas. His hometown has not yet been liberated, and his fellow villagers and wife are still in dire straits. Therefore, class hatred is reflected in him more profoundly. Through the depiction of these two people's warriors, the author expresses Chairman Mao's thought on people's war and people's army. After watching the film, recalling the situation when our army first entered the Northeast after the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, it is still vivid in my mind.
    I remember that in 1945, after Japan surrendered, when we first arrived in the Northeast region to work, Chiang Kai-shek, with the direct help of American imperialism, transported a large number of his main forces to the Northeast, surpassing us in both quantity and equipment. The vast areas of the Northeast were controlled by the so-called vanguard forces appointed by Chiang Kai-shek—puppet Manchukuo soldiers, police, habitual bandits, and landlord armed forces. It was truly a dark and hopeless situation. The broad masses of the people did not know enough about our Party and our army, and many people had illusions about Chiang Kai-shek, the so-called "orthodox" leader. In addition, under the suppression of reactionary forces, most people adopted a neutral wait-and-see attitude. When our army first arrived in the Northeast, we were unfamiliar with the people and the place, like fish out of water. In this situation, although the troops were of good quality and brave in combat, and had won many battles, the casualties could not be replenished, and supplies were very difficult. Just as we were facing these difficulties, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao issued the instruction "Establish Consolidated Base Areas in the Northeast," pointing out: "The current task of our Party in the Northeast is to establish base areas, to establish consolidated military and political base areas in Eastern Manchuria, Northern Manchuria, and Western Manchuria." The instruction called on the Party organizations and all Party members in the Northeast region to launch mass struggles, solve problems for the masses, rely on the masses in everything, mobilize all forces to engage in careful mass work, and lay a preliminary reliable foundation within a year, especially in the recent few months of emergency. The wise instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao were like a lighthouse on the vast sea, illuminating our path forward. Under the leadership of the Northeast Bureau headed by Comrade Lin Biao, we resolutely implemented the wise instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao: the main forces and leading organs took the initiative to withdraw from some large cities, dispersed to the vast rear to suppress bandits and mobilize the masses, and Comrade Lin Biao personally mobilized 30,000 cadres to go to the countryside to do mass work. After less than a year of hard work, just as the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao estimated, the situation in the Northeast completely changed. Most of the bandits were eliminated, the masses were basically mobilized, the troops had a consolidated rear, and the second-line corps (new corps composed of liberated peasants) continuously supplemented and strengthened the main forces. The main forces were no longer fish out of water, but fish thriving in deep water. This turning point was the political turning point in the Northeast battlefield, and also the military turning point. Wan Liangcai and his father in "People's Warrior" are the embodiment of the infinite power generated by this wise instruction of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao among the people. Today, re-watching this film and recalling this struggle, I realize the greatness of Mao Zedong Thought even more.
    In the film "People's Warrior," the author, through the plot of the soldier Liu Xing enhancing his awareness in the speaking bitterness movement and growing into a great people's warrior, depicts the great achievements made politically by the new-style military rectification movement of speaking bitterness and three check-ups launched by our army, and depicts the power of our army's political and ideological work. It also profoundly embodies the nature of the war and the class essence of our army. In his article "Comments on the Great Victory in Northwest China and the New-Style Military Rectification Movement of the People's Liberation Army," Chairman Mao gave a very high evaluation to the speaking bitterness and three check-ups movement that was widely carried out in the troops at that time. Although the description of the speaking bitterness and three check-ups movement in "People's Warrior" is a bit simple, it is very valuable in revealing the main factor among the various factors of our army's combat effectiveness, that is, the factor of people's class consciousness. In some literary works describing revolutionary wars and people's armies, although they also write about the heroic combat of commanders and fighters, they often do not fully express the class and ideological foundation of our army's commanders and fighters' heroic combat, the power of our army's political and ideological work, and how Party workers in the troops mobilize the armed masses. This will inevitably reduce the depth of the depiction of our army's class essence, and will weaken the ideological nature and infectiousness of the work.
    The re-screening of films such as "People's Warrior" provides us with some living teaching materials for studying Volume Four of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," helping us to study Chairman Mao's works. But it also raises a new issue: these films, whether in terms of ideological content and artistry, or in terms of quantity and the breadth and depth of depicting revolutionary struggle life, cannot meet the needs of the broad masses of the audience. We ask writers and artists to further depict the great revolutionary practice carried out by the people of the whole country under the leadership of Chairman Mao, to deeply embody the radiant Mao Zedong Thought with higher artistic skills, and to provide us with more and better living teaching materials. The broad masses of readers and audiences need it, and communism needs it!

    ——重看影片《人民的战士》的感想
    陈亚丁
    最近，有机会重看了《南征北战》、《董存瑞》、《人民的战士》、《红鹰展翅》等一批表现我国人民革命战争的优秀影片。这些影片都是我们早已熟悉的、看过了不止一次，但今天在学习了《毛泽东选集》第四卷之后，再来看这些影片，又有些新的感受，得到许多新的启发，帮助我们从影片中再现的、全国人民在毛泽东思想指引下所进行的伟大革命斗争中，吸取感性的、活的知识，从而加深了我们对毛主席著作的理解。为了证实这一点，我在这里谈一谈重看《人民的战士》的感受。
    作者在这部影片中着力地塑造了当时东北地区人民解放军部队里的两个人物，一个是家在解放区的翻身战士万良才，这是一个完全新型的人，他为保卫胜利果实而战，为保卫工农的江山而战，为解放全国的劳苦大众而战，无产阶级觉悟的光辉闪耀在这个青年战士身上；另一个是家在蒋匪统治地区的老战士刘兴，他的家乡还没有解放，他的乡亲和妻子都还在水深火热之中，因而，阶级的仇恨在他的身上体现得更加深沉。作者通过对这两个人民战士的描写，表现了毛主席关于人民战争和人民军队的思想。看了影片，回想起抗日战争结束后我军刚进入东北时的情景，还历历如在目前。
    记得1945年日本投降后，我们刚到东北地区工作时，蒋介石在美帝国主义的直接帮助下，把主力部队大批地运到东北，无论在数量和装备上都超过我们；东北的广大地区都控制在蒋介石委任的所谓先遣军——伪满国兵、警察、惯匪、地主武装的手里，真是暗无天日；广大群众对我党我军还不够了解，不少人对蒋介石这个所谓“正统”有幻想，加之在反动势力的压制下，大部采取中立观望态度；我军初到东北，人地生疏，有如缺水之鱼。在这种情况下，虽然部队质量很好，作战勇敢，也打了不少胜仗，但伤亡了得不到补充，供给也十分困难。正当面临这些困难的时候，党中央和毛主席发出了《建立巩固的东北根据地》的指示，指出：“我党现时在东北的任务，是建立根据地，是在东满、北满、西满建立巩固的军事政治的根据地。”指示东北地区的党组织和全体党员要发动群众斗争，替群众解决问题，一切依靠群众，动员一切力量从事细心的群众工作，在一年之内，特别是在最近几个月的紧急时期内，打下初步的可靠的基础。党中央和毛主席的英明指示，真像茫茫大海上的灯塔一样，照亮了我们前进的道路。在以林彪同志为首的东北局领导下，坚决贯彻了党中央和毛主席的英明指示：主力部队和领导机关主动撤出了一些大城市，分散到广大的后方去剿匪和发动群众，林彪同志亲自动员三万干部下乡，去做群众工作。经过不到一年的艰苦工作，正如党中央和毛主席的估计一样，东北的形势完全改变了，土匪大部肃清了，群众基本上发动起来了，部队有了巩固的后方，二线兵团（由翻身农民组成的新的兵团）源源不断地补充壮大了主力，主力部队再也不是缺水之鱼，而是水深鱼壮了。这一个转折是东北战场政治上的转折点，也是军事上的转折点。《人民的战士》中的万良才和他的父亲，正是党中央和毛主席这一英明指示在人民群众中产生无穷力量的体现。今天，重看这部影片，回想起这段斗争生活，就越发认识到毛泽东思想的伟大。
    在影片《人民的战士》中，作者通过战士刘兴在诉苦运动中提高了觉悟，成长为一个伟大的人民战士的情节，描写了我军开展诉苦三查的新式整军运动在政治上所取得的巨大成果，描写了我军政治思想工作的威力。也从而深刻地体现了战争的性质和我军的阶级本质。毛主席在《评西北大捷兼论解放军的新式整军运动》一文中，曾对当时部队中普遍开展的诉苦三查运动，给予了极高的评价。尽管在《人民的战士》中，对诉苦三查运动描写得简单了一些，但通过这一情节在揭示我军战斗力诸因素中的主要因素，即人的阶级觉悟的因素这一点上，却是十分可贵的。在有些描写革命战争和人民军队的文艺作品中，虽然也写了指战员的英勇作战，但对我军指战员英勇作战的阶级的、思想的基础，对我军政治思想工作的威力和部队中党的工作人员如何发动拿枪的群众的工作，却常常表现得不够充分，这就必然会降低对我军阶级本质的描写的深度，也就会减弱作品的思想性和感染力。
    《人民的战士》等影片的重演，给我们学习《毛泽东选集》第四卷提供了一些活的教材，帮助我们学习毛主席的著作。但也提出了一个新的问题：就是这些影片不论在思想性和艺术性上，不论是在数量和表现革命斗争生活的广度和深度上，都还不能满足广大观众的需要。我们要求作家艺术家更进一步地描写在毛主席领导下全国人民所进行的伟大的革命实践，以更高的艺术技巧去深刻地体现光芒万丈的毛泽东思想，给我们提供更多更好的活的教材。广大的读者和观众需要它，共产主义需要它！
