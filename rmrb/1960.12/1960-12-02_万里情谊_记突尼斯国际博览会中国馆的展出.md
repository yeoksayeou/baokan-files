    Deep Friendship
    ——Remembering the Exhibition of the Chinese Pavilion at the Tunis International Fair
    Wang Wei, Lu Mingzhu
    The Chinese Pavilion was warmly welcomed at this year's Tunis International Fair. In the Tunisian capital, which has a population of only 400,000, the number of visitors to the Chinese Pavilion exceeded 600,000. They were left with the most unforgettable and wonderful memories of the Chinese Pavilion. During the half-month exhibition, the feelings of millions of Tunisians, Algerians, and Black Africans merged with those of the Chinese people, who are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers. They sincerely expressed their most friendly feelings, praise, admiration, and love for China to the staff of the Chinese Pavilion.

    A Giant Magnet
    The rich and colorful Chinese Pavilion, like a giant magnet, strongly attracted people's attention. One day, a young woman visited the Chinese Pavilion accompanied by her female companion. As she was about to leave, the Chinese Pavilion staff realized that she was blind. Although she couldn't see anything, out of her love for China, she had her companion explain everything to her one by one. She not only visited the entire Chinese Pavilion, but also asked her companion to write down her dictated message before leaving.

    After visiting the Chinese Pavilion, everyone praised China's achievements in the Great Leap Forward. One visitor said: "Seeing the most exquisite products of 1960 in the Chinese Pavilion proves the victory of China's continued Great Leap Forward." The "Red Flag" sedan, a product of China's Great Leap Forward, was exhibited in Tunisia for the first time, arousing great interest among the audience. Some viewers said that it was amazing that China is now able to produce such cars. Many viewers repeatedly watched the car from the inside to the outside, and they greatly admired the design of the car, including its beauty, performance, and automatic equipment.

    Another center of attraction for the audience in the Chinese Pavilion was the agricultural section of the exhibition hall and the pictures of the people's communes. From Tunisian government officials to ordinary viewers, they were particularly interested in the industry run by the communes, believing that this was a good way to revive a country's economy. Many viewers lingered in front of the agricultural platform. They touched and looked at China's agricultural products again and again, and always liked to take away a few grains of Chinese wheat or a rice plant. After seeing the photos of the people's communes, a visitor said to the staff of the Chinese Pavilion: "The people's commune is good!" After visiting the Chinese Pavilion, the Governor of the National Bank of Tunisia said that the "agriculture-based" policy is also applicable to Africa.

    Bridge of Friendship
    The Chinese Pavilion is like a bridge of friendship, connecting the hearts of the Chinese and Tunisian people, making them more aware of each other, and further deepening their mutual friendship. The following is an example of countless touching facts: A housewife came to see the Chinese Pavilion five times in a row. Once, she brought a pair of Arab women's bracelets and gave them to a female staff member of the Chinese Pavilion. Because the female staff member politely declined, she kept holding the bracelet until the other party could not insist and accepted it. She invited Chinese friends to take pictures with her almost every time she came to the Chinese Pavilion. On the day the Expo closed, she stayed in the Chinese Pavilion almost all day.

    Despite the language barrier, many viewers hoped to shake hands with the Chinese staff or take a photo. Some viewers learned to trace the two characters "中国" (China) in the guestbook. The six visitors' books in the Chinese Pavilion were often in short supply. After visiting the Chinese Pavilion, an African worker at the hotel where the Chinese exhibition delegation was staying didn't have the opportunity to leave a message because there were too many people. The next day, when he was tidying up the room where the interpreters of the exhibition delegation lived, he respectfully added his impressions in Arabic.

    During the exhibition in the Chinese Pavilion, almost most of the professional photographers of the entire Expo gathered in the Chinese Pavilion, because there were always many viewers willing to take photos in the Chinese Pavilion. According to their own preferences, the audience took a photo in front of the statue of Chairman Mao, or in front of the machine platform, or with colorful silk as the background, or with the abundant harvest platform as the background, to keep a souvenir.

    Salute to Chairman Mao
    During the exhibition, the audience who visited the Chinese Pavilion expressed their infinite respect and love for Chairman Mao. One viewer found a staff member of the Chinese Pavilion, took out a large photo of Chairman Mao from his pocket, raised his hand to the Chinese staff to signal, and then carefully hid the photo. The Chinese staff of the exhibition hall received almost every day many visitors who asked to introduce Chinese books and periodicals, especially the works of Chairman Mao. These enthusiastic viewers included not only Tunisians, but also guests from Algeria, Guinea, Cameroon, Dahomey, Central Africa, the Republic of Mali, Senegal and other places. The reporter met an Algerian soldier who had just returned from the front in Algeria, covered in dust, with a military belt with the Algerian national emblem polished and varnished exposed at his waist. He said that he hoped to immediately bring back to his comrades books and periodicals introducing China, especially the works of Chairman Mao. A viewer from Dahomey told reporters that he had read Chairman Mao's works. He said that Chairman Mao was a great Marxist and a true Leninist. He hoped to continue reading Chairman Mao's works. He especially requested Chairman Mao's "On Protracted War." Many viewers' messages expressed their respect and love for Chairman Mao. One viewer wrote: "I especially admire the revolutionary spirit of Mao Zedong Thought." Said Muhammad, Minister of State of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, said, "We hope that all oppressed people will follow the path opened up by Chinese leaders in order to accelerate their economic and social independence. Everyone should be inspired by the principles established by China to eradicate the remnants of colonialism." The head of the Tunisian Neo Destour Party delegation, who had just returned from a visit to China, said that China's construction experience is very useful to Tunisia, especially the "walking on two legs" approach.

    Many viewers often used the simplest words to express their feelings after visiting the Chinese Pavilion. The visitors' book is full of such sentences: "Long live the Great Leap Forward!" "Long live New China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Salute to the Chinese people." Many messages condemned the US imperialist hostile attitude towards China and expressed their determination to support the Chinese people in liberating Taiwan. One viewer wrote: "One day, you (Chinese) will drive the United States out of Taiwan."

    Common Struggle
    The friendship of the African people for the Chinese people is based on the common struggle against imperialism. China and the African people have long suffered the common experiences of imperialist oppression and enslavement, and their common determination to firmly oppose imperialism helps them to better understand each other. At a gathering held by the Tunisian Minister of Information for the head of the Chinese exhibition delegation, Chinese guests and Tunisian and Algerian friends present all talked about the common experiences of the people of their respective countries. The head of the Chinese exhibition delegation said that before liberation, the gate of the Shanghai Foreign Park often hung the imperialist sign "Chinese and dogs are not allowed to enter" to insult the Chinese people. After hearing this, Tunisian and Algerian friends said to the Chinese guests with emotion that the same imperialist signs insulting the colonial people had also appeared in the territories of Tunisia and Algeria. This common experience has led to a common desire to develop friendship between China and the African people.

    From President Bourguiba to every Tunisian who has visited the Chinese Pavilion, on the one hand, they praised the great achievements of China's construction undertakings, and at the same time repeatedly expressed their hope to continuously enhance the friendly relations between the two countries. "Great cause, great effort." President Bourguiba used these two sentences to praise the Chinese Pavilion. He said that Tunisia hopes to build its own country like China's Great Leap Forward. He expressed his firm belief that the relations between Tunisia and China will be further developed.

    The Tunisian Foreign Minister said well: Although Tunisia and China have different social systems, the two countries have a common desire to build their own motherland. He said that the construction achievements that China has achieved and is achieving are very useful for a young, newly independent country. He also said that Tunisia and China have a long history of relations, and this relationship should be restored and developed in the twentieth century today. The Tunisian Minister of Agriculture visited the Chinese Pavilion many times, especially the agricultural part of the Chinese Pavilion. He enthusiastically said to the head of the Chinese exhibition delegation: "The Tunisian people admire the Chinese people for overcoming difficulties and solving various problems under the leadership of Chairman Mao through self-reliance and achieving great achievements." He said, "China is a big country, and the development of agriculture is amazing. China's experience in developing agriculture, especially in turning a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country, is worth learning from and is an example." He pointed out that "the main reason for China's progress lies in the fact that the Chinese people have mastered their own destiny and become the masters of the country." He said, "The deep feelings between the people of Tunisia and China have a natural foundation. For hundreds of years, our two countries have never invaded the territory of other countries. On the contrary, they were ruled by imperialism for a long time, and the people of both countries have gone through arduous struggles to gain independence. The Chinese people's struggle against imperialism has greatly encouraged the African people." (Attached picture)

### 万里情谊——记突尼斯国际博览会中国馆的展出

    万里情谊
    ——记突尼斯国际博览会中国馆的展出
    王纬　陆明珠
    在今年的突尼斯国际博览会，中国馆受到了热烈的欢迎。仅仅有四十万人口的突尼斯首都，参观中国馆的人次竟达六十万以上。他们对中国馆留下了最难忘、最美好的记忆。在半个月的展出期间，千千万万的突尼斯人、阿尔及利亚人、黑非洲人同远隔千山万水的中国人民的感情交融在一起了。他们由衷地向中国馆的工作人员表示他们最友好的情谊，他们的赞美、欣羡和对中国的热爱。
    巨大的磁石
    丰富多采的中国馆像一块巨大的磁石一样，强烈地吸引着人们的注意力。一天，有一位年轻的妇女由她的女伴陪同到中国馆参观。当她快离开中国馆的时候，中国馆的工作同志才发现原来她是一个盲人。尽管她什么也看不见，但是出于对中国的热爱，她让她的女伴一一向她解释，她不仅参观完了整个中国馆，临走的时候，还请她的女伴记下她口述的留言。
    人们参观了中国馆之后，没有不赞美中国大跃进的成就的。一个观众说：“在中国馆看到1960年最精美的产品，它证明了中国继续大跃进的胜利。”中国大跃进的产物——“红旗”牌小轿车第一次在突尼斯展出，引起观众极大的兴趣。有的观众说，中国现在能够生产这样的汽车，实在惊人。许多观众对这辆汽车从里到外反复观看，他们对这种汽车的设计包括它的美观、性能和自动装备都非常赞美。
    中国馆另一个吸引观众的中心是展览馆的农业部分与人民公社的图片。从突尼斯的政府官员到一般观众，都对公社办工业特别发生兴趣，认为，这是一个国家经济复兴的好办法。许多观众在农业台前流连忘返。他们对中国的农产品摸了又摸，看了又看，而且总喜欢带走几粒中国小麦或一株稻子。一个参观者看了人民公社的照片之后，对中国馆工作人员说：“人民公社好！”突尼斯国家银行总督参观了中国馆之后说，“以农业为基础”的方针对非洲也是适用的。
    友谊的桥梁
    中国馆像一座友谊的桥梁，连结着中突两国人民的心，使彼此之间更加了解了，相互的情谊进一步加深了。下面是无数件感人的事实中的一个事例：有一位家庭妇女接连五次来看中国馆。一次，她带来一副阿拉伯妇女的手镯，送给中国馆的一位女工作人员，由于这位女工作人员婉言谢绝，她一直捧着手镯，直到对方实在无法坚持，收下为止。她几乎每次来中国馆都邀请中国朋友一起照像。博览会闭幕那一天，她几乎整整在中国馆呆了一天。
    尽管语言隔阂，但是许多观众都希望和中国工作人员握握手，或拍一张照，有的观众在留言簿上学着描“中国”两个字。中国馆六本观众留言簿常常轮不过来，中国展览团所住旅馆的一名非洲工友，在参观中国馆之后，因为人太多没有机会留言。第二天，他在收拾展览团翻译人员住的屋子的时候，恭恭正正地用阿拉伯文补留了他的观感。
    在中国馆展出期间，几乎整个博览会的大多数职业摄影师，都集中到中国馆来了，因为总有许多观众愿意在中国馆留影。观众们根据自己的喜爱，或者在毛主席的像前或者在机器台前，或以彩色缤纷的丝绸为背景，或以五谷丰登的丰产台为背景拍一张照，留一个纪念。
    向毛主席致敬
    在展览期间，参观中国馆的观众对毛主席表示了无限的敬爱。有一名观众找到中国馆的一位工作人员后，从衣袋里拿出一张毛主席的大照片，向中国工作人员举手示意，然后细心地把照片藏起来。展览馆的中国工作人员差不多每天都要接待许多要求介绍中国的书刊、特别是要求毛主席的著作的参观者。这些热情的观众不仅包括突尼斯人，而且包括从阿尔及利亚、几内亚、喀麦隆、达荷美、中非、马里共和国、塞内加尔等地远道来的客人。记者曾经遇见一个刚从阿尔及利亚前方归来、满身征尘的阿尔及利亚战士，腰间露出一条磨得发亮的、漆着阿尔及利亚国徽的军用皮带。他说，他希望马上给他的战友带回介绍中国的书刊，特别是毛主席的著作。一位来自达荷美的观众对记者说，他曾经读过毛主席的著作。他说，毛主席是伟大的马克思主义者，是真正的列宁主义者。他希望继续读毛主席的著作。他特别要求毛主席的《论持久战》一书。许多观众的留言表达了他们对毛主席的敬爱，一位观众写道：“我特别钦佩充满革命精神的毛泽东思想”。阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府国务部长赛义德·穆罕默德说，“我们希望所有被压迫的人民都遵循中国领导人所开辟的道路，以便加速自己的经济和社会独立。大家都应当从中国所树立的原则中得到启发，来铲除殖民主义的残余。”刚从中国访问回来的突尼斯新宪政党代表团团长说，中国建设经验对突尼斯很有用，特别是“两条腿走路”的方针。
    许多观众参观了中国馆之后，常常用最简单的文字来表达他们的感受。观众留言簿上充满这样的句子：“大跃进万岁！”“新中国万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”
  “向中国人民致敬”。有不少的留言谴责美帝国主义对中国的敌视态度，并表示支持中国人民解放台湾的决心。一位观众写道：“终有一天，你们（中国人）会把美国从台湾赶出去的。”
    共同的斗争
    非洲人民对中国人民的友谊，是建立在反对帝国主义这个共同斗争的基础上的。中国同非洲人民长期遭受帝国主义压迫和奴役的共同遭遇以及他们坚决反对帝国主义的共同决心，帮助他们相互更好的了解。在突尼斯情报部长为中国展览团负责人举行的一次聚会上，中国客人和在座的突尼斯、阿尔及利亚朋友不约而同地谈到各自国家人民的共同遭遇。中国展览团团长说，解放前的上海外国公园门口常常挂着“华人与狗不得入内”的帝国主义侮辱中国人的牌子。突尼斯和阿尔及利亚朋友听了之后，感慨地对中国客人说，在突尼斯和阿尔及利亚的国土上也出现过一模一样的帝国主义者侮辱殖民地人民的标志。这种共同的遭遇导致了发展中国同非洲人民的友谊的共同的愿望。
    从布尔吉巴总统直到参观过中国馆的每一个突尼斯人，一方面颂扬中国建设事业的巨大成就，同时一再表示希望不断增强两国的友好关系。“伟大的事业，巨大的努力。”布尔吉巴总统用这两句话来赞美中国馆。他说，突尼斯希望像中国大跃进那样来建设自己的国家。他表示深信，突中两国关系一定会得到进一步的发展。
    突尼斯外交部长说得好：尽管突中两国社会制度不同，但是两国有着建设自己祖国的共同愿望。他说，中国已经实现的和正在实现的建设成就对于一个年轻的新独立国家是非常有用的。他还说，突中两国有着悠久的历史关系，这种关系在二十世纪的今天应当得到恢复与发展。突尼斯农业部长多次参观了中国馆，特别是中国馆的农业部分。他热情地对中国展览团团长说：“突尼斯人民对中国人民在毛主席的领导下，用自力更生的方法克服困难，解决了各种问题，取得巨大的成就表示敬佩。”他说，“中国是一个大国，农业发展是惊人的。中国发展农业的经验，特别是使一个落后的农业国变成先进的工业国的经验是值得学习的，是一个榜样。”他指出，“中国进步的主要原因，在于中国人民掌握了自己的命运，做了国家的主人。”他说，“突中两国人民深厚的感情有着天然的基础，几百年来，我们两国从来没有侵略过别国的领土，相反被帝国主义长期统治，两国人民都经过艰苦的斗争才获得独立。中国人民对帝国主义的斗争给非洲人民极大的鼓舞。”（附图片）
