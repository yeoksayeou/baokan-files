Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing Telegram:
    Xuzhou City mobilized its technical forces to help the people's communes and production brigades of Tongshan County reform their grain processing grinders. The county has already reformed 364 sets of various grinders, totaling 1,391 millstones. Once all are put into use, it can save more than 13,000 laborers and over 6,000 head of livestock, which can then be投入农业生产第一线。

    The city's factories and enterprises have dispatched more than 60 technicians and workers to form a grinder reform team to provide specific assistance to the communes. Factories and enterprises have also tapped their potential to produce belts, silk bolting cloths, and small steel grinders for the grinder reform.

    During the grinder reform process, Tongshan County's communes mobilized more than 4,000 blacksmiths and carpenters to cooperate with the professional teams. They followed the principle of adapting to local conditions. Communes near power sources installed larger electric steel grinders. Communes with power tried to install more power-driven grinders. Communes without power or motive power installed multiple grinders pulled by one animal. Some communes built water-powered mills. Now, the county's grinder reform work has been basically completed. After these grinders were reformed, grain processing efficiency increased by five to twenty times. Previously, one animal pulling one stone mill could only grind 50 to 80 jin of flour per day; now, with bearings added to the stone mill and connected by belts, one animal can pull three to four millstones, and the speed is also faster than before, grinding 300 to 600 jin per day, with the highest reaching 1,000 jin. Electric and power-driven steel grinders are even more efficient.

    改革粮食磨子  节省劳力畜力
    据新华社南京电  徐州市动员技术力量，帮助铜山县各人民公社、生产大队改革加工粮食的磨子。全县已改各种磨子三百六十四套共一千三百九十一盘，全部使用后，可以节约出劳动力一万三千多人和六千多头牲畜投入农业生产第一线。
    全市各厂矿企业抽调了六十多名技术工人，组成磨子改革专业队，到各公社具体帮助进行改革工作。各厂矿企业还挖掘潜力，为磨子改革生产皮带、丝绡罗底、小钢磨等。
    在改革磨子的过程中，铜山县各公社动员了四千多名铁工、木工，配合专业队伍进行工作。他们根据因地制宜的原则，在靠电源近的公社就搞较大型的电力钢磨，有动力的公社就尽量多搞动力磨，没有电源也没有动力的公社，就搞一畜拉多磨，有的公社搞水力磨。现在，全县改磨工作已基本完成。这些磨子改革以后，使粮食加工效率提高了五到二十倍。原来一头牲畜拉一盘石磨，一天只能磨五十斤到八十斤面；现在把石磨加上轴承并用皮带联结起来，一头牲畜就能拉三到四盘，速度也比原来快，一天就能磨三百到六百斤，最高的达到一千斤。电力和动力钢磨效率更高。
