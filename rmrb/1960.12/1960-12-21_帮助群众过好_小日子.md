Helping the Masses Live a Good "Small Life"
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Yu Bing

Twenty-seven years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong said in "Be Concerned with the Well-being of the Masses, and Pay Attention to Methods of Work": "We should profoundly pay attention to the problems of the well-being of the masses, from the land and labor problems to the problems of firewood, rice, oil, and salt. ... All these problems of the well-being of the masses should be put on our agenda. They should be discussed, decided, implemented, and checked. We should make the broad masses realize that we represent their interests and are of one heart and mind with them."

Two years ago, the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China stated: "It is necessary to care about people and correct the tendency of seeing things but not people. The greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more the Party should care about the well-being of the masses. The more the Party cares about the well-being of the masses, the greater the enthusiasm of the masses will be. The view that production and life are opposed to each other, and that attaching importance to the well-being of the masses will hinder production, is wrong."

These two paragraphs, separated by twenty-five years in time, completely illustrate one point in spirit, that is, our Party has always been concerned about the well-being of the masses. The Harbin Municipal Party Committee's in-depth visits to residents' homes and comprehensive arrangements for the lives of the people throughout the city are vivid examples. The Party Committee of Tianjin State-owned Cotton Factory No. 6's in-depth visits to workers' dormitories and meticulous arrangements for the lives of workers' families are also vivid examples. They are not only concerned about production but also about life, not only about the concentrated life of the masses but also about the scattered life of households, from washing clothes to installing stoves, from storing vegetables to purchasing coal and grain, all within their scope of concern. It can be said that everything related to the lives of the masses has been put on their "agenda" and properly resolved.

Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are all life issues, and none can be missing. If cadres are unwilling to be "distracted" for the masses in this regard, then the masses themselves will inevitably be more "distracted" in this regard. In the end, the impact will not only be limited to the lives of the masses themselves. Conversely, if cadres can be more "distracted" for the masses' life problems, more masses will be able to save worry on life problems. The masses will be happy and full of energy, and will be able to carry out production better.

Of course, the life problems of the masses are all trivial problems, and some life problems should be handled by the masses themselves, and can also be handled by themselves. However, some life problems cannot be handled well or cannot be handled by the masses themselves, which affects production and hinders work. We should take a positive attitude and help the masses handle these problems well. Here, we should never take a "none of my business" attitude because these are trivial matters, these are the masses' own affairs. Instead, we should, like the Harbin Municipal Party Committee, like Tianjin State-owned Cotton Factory No. 6, go deep into residents' homes, go deep into workers' dormitories, help them arrange their lives, solve some problems that are not easy for the masses to solve themselves, and truly arrange the lives of the masses well.

Go deep among the masses, and earnestly help the masses solve some life problems, so that the broad masses realize that we represent their interests and are of one heart and mind with them. Then, the masses will start from these things, understand the higher tasks we put forward, accept our political calls, and contribute more to the cause of socialist construction. Jin Guichen, a worker at Tianjin State-owned Cotton Factory No. 6, said it well: "The Party not only worries about the big days of the 600 million people all day long, but also worries about the small days of every family, and truly cares for us meticulously." If we make the broad masses feel like Jin Guichen, so that many masses who live "small lives" care about the "big days" of the entire country. This will form a huge force that can overcome all difficulties and make our "big days" and "small days" increasingly move towards a better situation.

    帮助群众过好“小日子”
    于冰
    二十七年以前，毛泽东同志在《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》一文中说：“我们应该深刻地注意群众生活的问题，从土地、劳动问题，到柴米油盐问题。……一切这些群众生活上的问题，都应该把它提到自己的议事日程上。应该讨论，应该决定，应该实行，应该检查。要使广大群众认识我们是代表他们的利益的，是和他们呼吸相通的。”
    两年以前，中共八届六中全会《关于人民公社若干问题的决议》中说：“必须关心人，纠正那种见物不见人的倾向。群众的干劲越大，党越要关心群众生活。党越是关心群众生活，群众的干劲也会越大。把生产和生活对立起来，认为重视群众生活就会妨碍生产的观点，是错误的。”
    这两段话，在时间上相距二十五年，在精神上却完全说明一个问题，就是我们党历来都是关心群众生活的。哈尔滨市委深入居民家庭访问，全面安排全市人民生活是一个生动的例证。天津国棉六厂党委会深入职工宿舍，帮助职工家属细致地安排生活也是一个生动的例证。他们不仅关心生产，而且关心生活，不仅关心集中的群众生活，而且关心分散的住户生活，从拆洗衣服到安装火炉，从储存蔬菜到购买煤粮，都在他们关心的范围以内。可以说，一切与群众生活有关的事情，他们都提到“议事日程”上，并且妥善地解决了。
    衣、食、住、行，这些都是生活问题，缺一不可。如果干部不愿在这方面为群众“分心”，那么，群众自己势必为这方面更多地“分心”。到头来，影响所及，决不仅仅限于群众生活的本身。反过来说，如果干部能够多为群众生活问题“分心”，就会有更多的群众能在生活问题上省心。群众生活愉快，精神饱满，就会更好地进行生产。
    当然，群众的生活问题都是些琐碎问题，有些生活问题群众应该自己处理，也可以自己处理。可是，有些生活问题群众自己处理不好或处理不了，以至影响生产，妨碍工作，我们就应该采取积极态度，帮助群众把这些问题处理好。这里，决不应该因为这是琐碎的事，这是群众自己的事，而采取一种“事不关己、高高挂起”的态度。而应该像哈尔滨市委那样，像天津国棉六厂那样，深入到居民家庭中，深入到职工宿舍中，帮助他们安排生活，解决一些群众自己不易解决的问题，真正把群众生活安排好。
    深入群众，认真地帮助群众解决一些生活问题，使广大群众认识我们是代表他们的利益的，是和他们呼吸相通的。那么，群众就会从这些事情出发，了解我们提出来的更高的任务，接受我们的政治号召，为社会主义建设事业贡献更多的力量。天津国棉六厂的工人金贵臣说得好：“党不仅整天为六亿人民的大日子操心，还为每个家庭的小日子操心，真是对我们关怀得无微不至。”如果我们使广大群众都有金贵臣这样的感觉，使得许多过“小日子”的群众，都来关心整个国家的“大日子”。这样，将形成一种巨大的力量，可以冲破一切困难，使我们的“大日子”和“小日子”都日益走向美好的境地。
