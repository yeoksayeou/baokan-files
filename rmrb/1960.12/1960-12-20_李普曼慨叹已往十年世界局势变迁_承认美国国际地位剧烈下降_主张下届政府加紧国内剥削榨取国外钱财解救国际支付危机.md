Xinhua News Agency, 19th Dispatch from New York: Prominent American bourgeois commentator Walter Lippmann published articles in the *New York Herald Tribune* on the 17th and 18th, lamenting the declining political and economic status of the United States in the international arena, and admitting that the incoming Kennedy administration faces many difficulties.

In his article entitled "What Faces Us," Lippmann first demanded that the American ruling class understand "how enormous has been the change in the position of the United States in the world during the past decade." He said that when Kennedy "speaks of the loss of our (American) prestige and the deterioration of our power and position, this is not merely the alarmed view of a speaker campaigning at a national convention. The relative position of the United States in the world balance of power has markedly declined. In place after place, not only in Cuba, the Congo, Algeria and Laos, but in dealing with our allies, our diplomacy has become increasingly ineffective, and often embarrassingly ineffective." Lippmann admitted that this "basic situation" could not be "improved merely by long statements from the White House and the State Department about our intentions and our ideals," nor could it be "corrected merely by allocating another two or three billion dollars to the Defense Department." Recalling the past, Lippmann could not help but feel sentimental, saying: "At the end of the Second World War, because our enemies and our allies were exhausted, the relative position of the United States was very strong. At that time, our military power was greater because we monopolized nuclear weapons. We had more gold and greater productive capacity, and we were less vulnerable to attack than any other country, indeed than all other countries combined. (But) this situation did not last long."

Lippmann was particularly uneasy about the decline of American "prestige." He wrote: "The imbalance that was once in our favor has been changing. And after the Korean War, this situation underwent enormous changes. By around 1957, our relative military and economic power in the world had sharply declined. In the (American presidential) campaign, Eisenhower angrily denied it. But this is an indisputable fact. In vast areas of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, our military power has been largely offset. In the non-communist world, our ability to finance our foreign policy has been severely undermined by our payment situation."

Lippmann admitted that America's policies of aggression and war are increasingly opposed by people at home and abroad. He said that the "reactionary nature and tone" of American foreign policy has "alienated us from the broad masses of the people, not just farmers, workers, and young students."

This well-known strategist of the American monopoly groups believes that correcting America's military and economic "weaknesses" is the "most important task" of the Kennedy administration. He offered advice to the American ruling class, advocating intensifying the use of the labor aristocracy to undermine the American workers' movement, so that the monopoly capital groups can further strengthen their exploitation of the American working people, in order to "strengthen our competitive ability in the world." He also advocated "revising many of the obligations we undertook after the war," and stepping up efforts to force America's "allies" to come up with more money to solve America's international payment crisis.

    李普曼慨叹已往十年世界局势变迁
    承认美国国际地位剧烈下降
    主张下届政府加紧国内剥削榨取国外钱财解救国际支付危机
    新华社19日讯　纽约消息：美国著名资产阶级评论员李普曼17日和18日在《纽约先驱论坛报》上发表文章，悲叹美国在国际上的政治、经济地位江河日下，承认即将上台的肯尼迪政府面临许多困难。
    李普曼在这篇题为《我们（美国）面临着什么》的文章中，首先要求美国统治集团了解，“过去十年来美国在世界上的地位发生了多么巨大的变化”。他说，当肯尼迪“谈到我们（美国）的威信的丧失和我国的力量和地位的恶化的时候，这不仅仅是一个在全国代表大会上竞选的演讲人的惊慌看法。美国在世界力量对比中的相对地位已经明显地下降了。在一个地方又一个地方，不仅在古巴、刚果、阿尔及利亚和老挝，在处理同我们的盟国的关系方面，我们的外交越来越失效，而且常常是使人感到难堪地失效。”李普曼承认，这种“基本情况”不是“单靠白宫和国务院发表关于我们的意图和我们的理想的长篇声明所能改善的”，也不是“单靠再拨出二、三十亿美元给国防部所能纠正的”。缅怀过去，李普曼不免感慨系之，他说：“在第二次世界大战结束后，由于我们的敌人和我们的盟国都精疲力尽，美国的相对地位非常强大。那时，我们的军事力量更大，因为我们垄断了核武器。我们有更多的黄金和更大的生产能力，我们比其他任何一个国家，的确比其他所有的国家加在一起更不易受到攻击。（但是）这种情况并没有持续多久。”
    李普曼对美国的“威信”下降特别感到不安。他写道：“曾经一度对我们有利的不平衡状况一直在改变着。而在朝鲜战争以后，这种情况发生了巨大的变化。到1957年前后，我们在世界上的相对军事和经济力量剧烈地下降了。在（美国总统）竞选运动中，艾森豪威尔气忿忿地加以否认。但是这是不容争辩的事实。在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的广大地区，我们的军事力量在很大程度上被抵销了。在非共产主义世界里，我们用来资助我国外交政策的能力被我国的支付情况严重地破坏了。”
    李普曼承认，美国的侵略政策和战争政策日益受到国内外人民的反对。他说，美国外交政策的“反动性质和语气”使美国“同广大的人民群众，不仅仅是农民、工人和青年学生，疏远了”。
    美国垄断集团的这个著名谋士认为，纠正美国在军事上和经济上的“弱点”，是肯尼迪政府的“最重要的任务”。他向美国统治集团献策，鼓吹加紧利用工人贵族来破坏美国的工人运动，让垄断资本集团进一步加强对美国的劳动人民的剥削，以便“加强我们在世界上的竞争能力”。他还鼓吹“修订我们战后承担的许多义务”，加紧迫使美国的“盟国”拿出更多的钱，来解救美国的国际支付危机。
