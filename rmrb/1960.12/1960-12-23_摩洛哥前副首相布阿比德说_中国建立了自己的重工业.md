According to a report in the Moroccan newspaper *Al Tahrir* on the 14th, former Moroccan Deputy Prime Minister and General Secretary of the National Union of Popular Forces of Morocco, Abdel Rahim Buabid, recently introduced the experience of China's socialist construction in a speech to Moroccan students.

In his speech entitled "The Problem of Economic Development of African Countries - The Choice Between Capitalist Experience and Socialist Experience," Buabid said, "We must study the socialist experience and the results achieved by certain countries in this experience over the years. No one can deny the great achievements that the People's Republic of China has made in a short period of time. No one can deny that the People's Republic of China has now established its own heavy industry, thus becoming one of the most modern industrial countries in the world. China has completed land reform. China has achieved miracles in education and technical cadre training. The people of the whole country have been mobilized, full of enthusiasm and strict discipline, to complete the plan. The problem of unemployment has been successfully solved.”

    据摩洛哥《解放报》14日报道，摩洛哥前副首相、摩洛哥人民力量全国联盟行政事务总书记阿卜杜勒·拉希姆·布阿比德最近在向摩洛哥学生讲演时介绍了中国社会主义建设的经验。
    布阿比德在他所作的题为“非洲国家经济发展的问题——资本主义的经验和社会主义的经验之间的选择”的演讲中说，“我们必须研究社会主义的经验以及某些国家在几年来所取得这种经验的成果。没有人能够否认，人民中国在短短的时期以内所取得的伟大成就。没有人能够否认人民中国现在已经建立了自己的重工业，从而成为世界最现代化的工业国之一。中国完成了土地改革。中国在教育和技术干部训练方面取得了成果，这是一个奇迹。全国人民都已经动员起来，满腔热情地和严守纪律地去完成计划。失业问题已经胜利解决。”
