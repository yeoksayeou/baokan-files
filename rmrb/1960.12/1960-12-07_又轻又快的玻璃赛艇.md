    Lightweight and Fast Glass Rowing Boats
    The lighter and faster a rowing boat is on the water, the better. Based on this requirement, the Shanghai Wooden Sports Equipment Factory has researched and adopted organic glass, a new material, to make rowing boats. The components of the rowing boat are all pressed from whole pieces of organic glass, and then glued together with an adhesive. The surface of the boat is smooth, and the drag on the water is less than that of wooden rowing boats. Using organic glass to make rowing boats not only improves the quality of use, but also can be made into various colors, transparent or opaque, according to needs, which is also unmatched by wooden rowing boats in terms of appearance.

    又轻又快的玻璃赛艇
    赛艇在水上划行，越轻越快越好。上海木制运动器具厂根据这个要求，就研究采用有机玻璃这种新材料来做赛艇。赛艇上的部件都是用整块有机玻璃压制出来的，然后用一种胶合剂胶合起来。艇身表面光滑，在水面上划行阻力比木制赛艇小。用有机玻璃做赛艇不仅使用质量提高，而且可以根据需要制成各种各样的色彩，透明的或不透明的，外观方面也为木制赛艇所不及。
