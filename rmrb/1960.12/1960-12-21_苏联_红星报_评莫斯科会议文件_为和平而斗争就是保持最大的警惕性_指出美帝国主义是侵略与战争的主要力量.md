    Report from this newspaper: The Soviet "Red Star" published an editorial on December 13th entitled "We Need a High Degree of Vigilance," excerpts of which are as follows:
    In recent days, all of humanity has been closely watching the historically significant documents of our time – the Statement of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties and the Appeal to the Peoples of the World, watching the issues raised at this meeting, primarily the most pressing issue of the moment – war and peace.
    The Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties gave a detailed answer to this question. The fatal inevitability of war does not exist. The Meeting's statement said that the time has come when it is possible to thwart the imperialist aggressors from launching a world war.
    However, the non-existence of the fatal inevitability of war does not mean that we can forget the possibility of the outbreak of war. Just as the exploitation of man by man is a horrifying product of the capitalist system, war is a constant companion of capitalism. In the life of just one generation, imperialism has imposed two devastating world wars on humanity.
    Now, the imperialist aggressors are threatening to drag the people of all countries into an even more terrible disaster. The danger of a new world war has not passed. This danger is brought to all mankind primarily by US imperialism. US imperialism is the main force of aggression and war, and its policies embody the thinking of the bellicose reactionaries. US imperialism drags the capitalist countries dependent on it into a web of aggressive military blocs and military bases. The spearhead of these blocs and bases is directed primarily against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. At the same time, the threat posed by West German revanchists to the cause of peace in Europe is constantly increasing. They openly declare their intention to revise the boundaries determined after the Second World War. With the help of the United States, the hotbed of war in the Far East is being actively revived. US imperialists are doing everything possible to strangle the Cuban revolution, and are blatantly interfering in the affairs of the people of Africa, Latin America, and the Near and Middle East. Naturally, all these events and facts cannot but arouse the vigilance of the people of all countries. Never before has it been so necessary for the people of all countries to maintain a particularly high degree of vigilance. The statement said: Today, to fight for peace is to maintain the greatest vigilance, to tirelessly expose the policies of imperialism, to vigilantly watch the conspiracies and tricks of the instigators of war, to arouse the sacred anger of the people of the world against those who adhere to the war policy, to enhance the organization of all peace-loving forces, to continuously strengthen the active actions of the masses in defending peace, and to strengthen cooperation with all countries that do not want a new war.
    The Soviet people have always been and will continue to be active defenders of world peace. But at the same time, they are clearly aware of the aggressive nature of imperialism. They have done and are now doing everything possible to protect the security of their homeland, to protect it from bandit attacks, and to improve the country's defense capabilities. The Soviet armed forces, equipped with first-class military technology and weapons, are guarding the great achievements of the October Revolution and the peaceful and constructive labor of our people. It is infinitely loyal to its people and loyal to the cause of the Communist Party.
    The Soviet military greatly agrees with and welcomes the Statement of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties and the Appeal to the Peoples of the World. Officer Ni·Nazarov said: "The historic documents of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties encourage us to achieve new successes in learning and strengthening military discipline. We consider it our sacred duty to more persistently strengthen the combat readiness of the troops and be prepared at all times. Let the imperialists not think that they can catch us off guard." The Soviet military is clearly aware that vigilance and combat readiness are the main requirements placed on them by the current international situation. At the same time, it should be pointed out that due to the new conditions arising from the appearance of atomic weapons and rockets, a new attitude must be adopted towards solving the problem of combat readiness of all services and arms. It is precisely for this reason that today combat readiness should not be calculated in hours, or even minutes, but in seconds. Every soldier should keep firmly in mind that when the army is widely equipped with powerful technology that requires collective efforts, the high combat readiness of every crew of warships, aircraft, and tanks, every squad, and even every soldier, sailor, sergeant, and officer will have an important impact on the combat readiness of troops, warships, and detachments.

    苏联“红星报”评莫斯科会议文件
    为和平而斗争就是保持最大的警惕性
    指出美帝国主义是侵略与战争的主要力量
    本报讯　苏联《红星报》12月13日发表题为《我们需要高度的警惕性》的社论，摘要如下：
    近几天来，全人类都在密切注视我们时代的具有历史意义的文件——共产党和工人党代表会议声明和告世界人民书，注视这次会议提出的问题，首先是现时最迫切的问题——战争与和平。
    共产党和工人党代表会议对于这个问题作出了详尽的答复。战争的注定不可避免性是不存在的。会议声明说，可以挫败帝国主义侵略者发动世界战争的时候已经到来。
    但是，战争注定不可避免性的不存在，绝不意味着我们可以忘记爆发战争的可能性。正如人剥削人是资本主义制度骇人听闻的产物一样，战争是资本主义的经常伴侣。仅仅在一代人的生活中，帝国主义就把两次毁灭性的世界战争强加于人类。
    现在，帝国主义侵略者威胁着要把各国人民拖入更加可怕的灾祸中。新的世界战争的危险，还没有过去。这种危险，首先是美帝国主义带给全人类的。美帝国主义是侵略与战争的主要力量，它的政策体现着好战的反动派的思想。美帝国主义把依附它的资本主义国家拖进侵略的军事集团和军事基地的罗网中。这些集团和基地的矛头首先是指向苏联和其他社会主义国家的。与此同时，西德复仇主义者对欧洲和平事业的威胁有增无已。他们公然宣称打算重新修改第二次世界大战后确定的边界。在美国的帮助下，远东的战争策源地正积极复活。美帝国主义者竭尽一切力量，力图绞杀古巴的革命，赤裸裸地干涉非洲、拉丁美洲和中近东各国人民的事务。自然，这一切事件和事实不能不引起各国人民的警惕。从来没有像目前这样要求各国人民保持特别高的警惕性。声明说：今天，为和平而斗争，就是保持最大的警惕性，不倦地揭露帝国主义的政策，警觉地注视战争挑拨者的阴谋诡计，唤起世界人民对那些坚持战争方针的人的神圣愤怒，提高一切爱好和平力量的组织性，不断加强群众保卫和平的积极行动，加强同一切不愿意有新战争的国家合作。
    苏联人民过去一向是、今后仍将是世界和平的积极捍卫者。但是，同时他们又清楚地知道帝国主义的侵略实质。他们过去和现在都尽一切力量来保卫自己祖国的安全，使它免遭强盗的进攻，并提高祖国的国防能力。以头等军事技术和武器装备着的苏联武装力量，在警卫着十月革命的伟大成果、我国人民的和平建设性劳动。它无限忠于自己的人民，忠于共产党的事业。
    苏联军人极大的赞同，欢迎共产党和工人党代表会议声明和告世界人民书。军官尼·纳扎罗夫说：“共产党和工人党代表会议的历史性文件，鼓舞我们在学习和加强军人纪律中取得新的成就。我们认为自己的神圣义务就是要更加坚持不懈地加强部队的战斗素养，时刻作好准备。让帝国主义不要以为可以使我们措手不及。”苏联军人清楚地意识到警惕性和战斗素养，是现时国际局势对他们提出的主要的要求。同时，应该指出，由于出现原子武器和火箭而产生的新条件，对于解决各兵种的战斗素养问题必须采取新的态度。正是因为这样，今天战斗素养应该不是以小时，甚至也不是分计，而是以秒计。每一个军人都应该牢牢记住：当军队广泛地装备着要求集体努力的强大技术时，每一个军舰飞机坦克的乘务组、每一个小队，甚至每一个士兵、水兵、士官和军官的高度战斗素养，都会对部队、军舰和支队的战斗素养发生重要的影响。
