Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 27th — Cuban writers and artists are currently preparing for a national congress to be held next year to discuss literary and artistic guidelines and promote the further development of national culture. More than three hundred writers, artists, and intellectuals recently issued a joint statement calling on all Cuban literary and artistic workers to get closer to the people, create according to the needs of the revolution, and fight for the development of national culture.

This militant call clearly represents the demands of the development of Cuban national culture and has been warmly responded to by Cuban writers and artists. Many writers and artists are preparing to go up to the mountains and down to the countryside next year to share weal and woe with the masses. At present, they are constantly eliminating the poison of American imperialist colonial culture and striving to promote the development of new national literature and art that serves the revolution and the people.

Before the victory of the revolution, American colonial culture suffocated Cuban national literature and art. Hollywood's pornographic films filled Cuban cinemas, and America's decadent, dispiriting music eroded the Cuban people. Since the victory of the revolution, the Cuban people have made valuable achievements in opposing the corrupt American cultural aggression and promoting the development of national culture.

The revolutionary government has established its own film industry and has produced about thirty excellent documentaries in the past two years. The first major film depicting the seven-year anti-dictatorial struggle, "History of the Revolution," will soon be released in Havana. The domestic documentaries that have already been shown include "National Congress," a film recording the conference where the Havana Declaration was issued, "Blacks," which opposes racial discrimination, "Why the Rebel Army Was Born," which shows that the Cuban people can only take up arms to overthrow the ruling class, "This Land of Ours," which exposes the cruel exploitation of peasants by large plantation owners, and "Agricultural and Livestock Cooperatives," which demonstrates the achievements of land reform. All these documentaries have rich revolutionary content and are closely linked to Cuba's current political and economic struggles.

In Cuba, soaring revolutionary music and healthy national music have overwhelmed American decadent tunes. Closely coordinating with the current struggle against American imperialism and defending the motherland is a feature of Cuban folk songs today. The capital's radio station broadcasts the program "Peasant Décimas" every day. Farmers use this form to play the guitar and improvise songs about their lives and struggles, using songs to expose the enemy and awaken the people. The peasant décima troupe led by the famous indigenous people's poet Naborí recently traveled throughout the rural areas of Las Villas Province, singing rural folk songs to mobilize farmers to join the militia to defend the motherland and their homes.

Amateur art groups are springing up all over the country. The Rebel Army, the Association of Rebel Youth, and other mass organizations today have their own choirs, which often sing revolutionary songs such as "The 26th of July March," "The Militia March," and "The Land Reform March" at mass rallies. The song and dance troupe of the 18th State-Owned Land Area Farmers Organization, which has persisted in armed struggle for thirty years, recently performed for urban residents at the Santiago Theater and was warmly welcomed.

Cuba's first national symphony orchestra has been established with the strong support of the government and held its first concert in October this year, playing symphonies full of national characteristics. Black music, which had been discriminated against before the victory of the revolution, is now also respected, and the National Theater is always packed when black folk art troupes perform.

Revolutionary visual art reflecting reality has been valued by the art community and loved by the broad masses of the people. Revolutionary artists have established a People's Visual Art Studio in Santiago, creating vibrant works with revolutionary content and simple tones. The "Revolutionary Visual Art Exhibition" was recently held at the National Museum of Fine Arts. Painters used their artistic talents to praise the continuous and heroic struggles waged by the people of Cuba and Latin America against American imperialism and for national liberation.

Cuban poetry, which has a fine tradition of serving the people's revolutionary struggle, has also developed after the victory of the revolution. The movement to donate "poetry planes" initiated by the poet Guillén and the famous Spanish poet Alberti has become a call to mobilize Cuban poets to write for the revolution and defend the motherland. Poetry recitals have been held in cooperatives in Camagüey Province, on the streets of heroic Santiago, and in trade unions in Havana. At these recitals, poets sang in poetic language about land reform and the invincible will of the Cuban people to defend their motherland.

In order to have the printing industry in their own hands to serve the revolutionary culture, the government founded the National Printing House. The works of Juan Marinello, Nicolás Guillén, Alejo Carpentier, Navala Luna, Félix Pita Rodríguez, and other revolutionary writers, who had been persecuted by the reactionary regime in the past, are now widely circulated. In addition, the National Printing House has also published a large number of popular books and textbooks to promote the literacy campaign.

    肃清殖民文化遗毒　服务当前革命斗争
    古巴民族文化欣欣向荣
    许多作家和艺术家准备深入群众丰富创作
    新华社哈瓦那27日电　古巴的作家和艺术家目前正在筹备明年召开的全国代表大会，来讨论文艺方针和促进民族文化的进一步发展。三百多名作家、艺术家和知识分子最近为此发表了联合声明，号召古巴所有的文艺工作者更加接近人民，根据革命的需要进行创作和为发展民族文化而斗争。
    这个战斗号召鲜明地代表了古巴民族文化发展的要求，得到了古巴的作家和艺术家们的热烈响应。不少的作家和艺术家准备在明年上山下乡和群众同甘共苦。目前，他们正在不断消除美帝国主义殖民文化的毒害，努力促进为革命、为人民群众服务的新的民族文学和艺术的发展。
    革命胜利前，美国的殖民文化窒息着古巴民族的文学和艺术。好莱坞的黄色影片充斥着古巴的电影院，美国的堕落的、令人消沉的音乐侵蚀着古巴人民。而革命胜利以来，古巴人民在反对腐朽的美国文化侵略、促进民族文化的发展上已经取得了可贵的成就。
    革命政府建立了自己的电影业，两年来拍摄了三十部左右的优秀纪录片。描写七年反独裁斗争的第一部大型影片“革命史”很快就要在哈瓦那和观众见面。已经放映的本国纪录片有记录了发表哈瓦那宣言那次大会的影片“全国大会”，有反对种族歧视的“黑人”，有表明古巴人民只有拿起武器去推翻统治阶级的“为什么诞生了起义军”，有揭露大庄园主残酷剥削农民的“我们的这块土地”以及表示土地改革成就的影片“农牧合作社”等。所有这些纪录片都具有丰富的革命内容和密切结合古巴目前的政治和经济斗争的特点。
    在古巴，高昂的革命音乐和健康的民族音乐压倒了美国的靡靡之音。同当前反对美帝国主义和保卫祖国的斗争紧密配合是今天古巴民歌的特点。首都的电台每天都播送《农民十言歌》的节目。农民们利用这种形式弹着吉他即席弹唱他们的生活和斗争，用歌声揭露敌人和唤醒人民。著名的印第安人民诗人纳沃里领导的农民十言歌演唱团最近走遍了拉斯维利亚斯省的农村，演唱农村民歌，动员农民参加民兵，保卫祖国和家园。
    业余艺术团体像雨后春笋一样在全国各地出现。起义军、起义青年联合会和其他群众团体今天都有自己的合唱团，他们经常在群众集会上演唱《7月26日进行曲》、“民兵进行曲”和《土地改革进行曲》等革命歌曲。三十年来一直坚持武装斗争的第十八国有土地区农民组织的歌舞团最近在圣地亚哥剧院为城市居民进行了演出，受到热烈欢迎。
    古巴第一个民族交响乐队已经在政府大力支持下成立，今年10月举行了第一次音乐会，演奏了充满民族色彩的交响乐。革命胜利前一直遭到歧视的黑人音乐今天也受到了尊重，每当黑人的民间艺术团在国家剧院演出的时候，总是座无虚席。
    反映现实的革命造型艺术受到艺术界的重视和广大人民群众的喜爱。革命艺术家在圣地亚哥建立了人民造型艺术室，创作了具有革命内容、色调质朴的朝气蓬勃的作品。最近在全国美术博物馆举行了“革命造型艺术展览会”。画家以他们的艺术天才歌颂了古巴和拉丁美洲人民所进行的反对美帝国主义和争取民族解放的持续不断的英勇斗争。
    具有为人民革命斗争服务的优良传统的古巴诗歌在革命胜利后也得到了发展。诗人纪廉和西班牙著名诗人阿耳贝蒂所发起的捐献“诗歌号飞机”的运动变成了动员古巴诗人为革命写作和保卫祖国的号召。在卡马圭省的合作社中，在英雄的圣地亚哥的大街上，在哈瓦那的工会中，都举行了诗歌朗诵会。在这些朗诵会上，诗人们以诗的语言歌唱土地改革和古巴人民保卫祖国的不可征服的意志。
    为了把印刷业掌握在自己手中来为革命的文化服务，政府创办了国家印刷厂。过去一向遭到反动政权迫害的胡安·马里内略、尼古拉斯·纪廉、阿莱霍·卡彭铁、纳瓦拉·卢纳、费利克斯·皮塔·罗德里格斯以及其他革命作家的作品，现在广为流传。此外，国家印刷厂还出版了大量通俗读物和课本来促进扫盲运动。
