Shijingshan Iron & Steel Plant Sintering Plant Does Good Preparatory Work
Month After Month Exceeding Planned Production Levels, Quarter After Quarter of Rising Production Levels
Their practice: The last month of each quarter and the middle of each month
Beginning specific production preparations for the next quarter and next month

    (Our report) The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company's sintering plant's staff, while grasping current production, have firmly grasped the next step of production preparation, and therefore everything is proactive, step by step proactive, promoting sustained leap forward in production. This year the plant has overfulfilled the plan every month, with production levels rising quarter by quarter. By the end of November, they had overfulfilled the first eleven months of the national plan by 11%, and quality indicators also exceeded the national plan.
    Starting from the last month of each quarter and the middle of each month, the department management, planning, technology, equipment, safety, business accounting, and labor organization personnel of the factory headquarters went to the front line and, together with the workers and administrators of the workshops and sections, started by checking the production operations, raw material consumption, and equipment operation of the current quarter and month. Combined with changes in raw materials, equipment, climate and other conditions in the next month and next season, the next stage of production was analyzed. During the analysis, it was proposed what preparations should be made for the next production period and how to prepare, and then it was handed over to the factory's employees for discussion. Finally, the factory leaders gathered together and made an action plan to prepare for the next production period. According to the plan for preparatory work, each department carries out specific preparatory work. In this way, as soon as the next season or month begins, production can be organized immediately according to the operation plan.
    The benefits of doing so are: First, because the leaders and the masses have conducted serious investigations and studies on the objective changes in various actual conditions, they can accurately grasp the key to future production, so that preparatory work can be targeted. At the beginning of this year, when they analyzed that improving the yield and operating rate in the current production were the two key issues to ensure that the utilization coefficient of the sintering machine could catch up with the advanced domestic level, the plant immediately launched a climax of improving operations and strengthening equipment maintenance. The staff successively formulated 25 sets of operating points and plans to strengthen 55 weak links. As a result of the implementation, the utilization coefficient of the sintering machine in March increased by 20.5% compared with February. Second, it can make the formulation and realization of technical measures happen earlier and faster, and play a role in production relatively quickly. In March of this year, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry decided to transfer a part of mineral powder with high sulfur content and fine particle size to the factory. In order to find out the law of desulfurization and pelletizing and sintering, the staff studied six schemes and carried out more than 100 experiments. As a result, they found a suitable batching ratio, so that this mineral powder was successfully used in the second quarter. Of the 17 measures formulated for November's production in October of this year, 6 were realized ahead of schedule at the end of October, and 8 were realized on schedule in November. This enabled November's production to comprehensively overfulfill the national plan. Third, workers and the masses not only participate in production, but also participate in preparation, and many measures can be implemented relatively quickly and accurately once they are determined. In August of this year, the factory's leaders and technicians, in an in-depth analysis on the front line, found that the iron content of the sintered ore fluctuated, which was a key issue that needed to be resolved in September. After on-site observation and comparison of the operations of the three shifts, they saw that the production operations of the three shifts had their own advantages. After summarizing, matching, and promoting the masses' experiences, the quality of sintered ore stabilized. As a result, the quality pass rate of sintered ore in September increased by 2.84% compared with August.
    The plant's analysis of production activities has now become a system. Before formulating the next month's plan, they not only send people to the company's internal supply and marketing department, coking plant, transportation department, machinery plant and other units to understand the supply, transportation, variety quality changes of raw materials, and the production of spare parts, but also go to the iron and steel plant to understand the blast furnace's opinions on sintered production, regularly exchange technical information with sintering plants across the country, compare advanced indicators and learn advanced experience, and then organize production. The whole factory conducts a security inspection of the equipment every quarter to find weak links and formulate improvement methods. The monthly inventory of spare parts is checked, the next month's spare parts production plan is arranged, and the pre-repair plan is arranged according to the equipment wear. In order to make the work more adaptable to changes in production, they also systematically check the preparation work three days before each overhaul, and the plan for each ten days is also adjusted at any time according to the situation. Workers and the masses also implemented the "sending ace troops" method in daily production, that is, before going to work every day, they send people to the upper, lower, left, and right processes to understand the situation and formulate measures for the shift. Various types of work and processes such as raw materials and transportation, batching and sintering, production and repair, have also established a system of mutual "reporting" situations. In this way, the factory's enterprise management work has become well-organized, and it can look ahead and behind, and be tight but not chaotic, and win the initiative in various tasks.
    At present, while striving to complete the current production tasks, the plant is actively preparing for next year's production. (Attached picture)

### 石钢烧结厂准备工作做得好  月月超额完成计划生产水平逐季上升  他们的作法：每一季的最后一个月每个月的中旬  就开始为下一季下一月进行具体的生产准备工作

    石钢烧结厂准备工作做得好
    月月超额完成计划生产水平逐季上升
    他们的作法：每一季的最后一个月每个月的中旬
    就开始为下一季下一月进行具体的生产准备工作
    本报讯　石景山钢铁公司烧结厂职工，在抓当前生产的同时，狠抓下一步的生产准备工作，因而事事主动、步步主动，促使生产持续跃进。今年来这个厂月月超额完成计划，生产水平逐季上升，到11月底，超额11％完成了前十一个月的国家计划，质量指标也超过了国家计划。
    这个厂从每一季的最后一个月和每个月的中旬开始，厂部管理计划、技术、设备、安全、经营核算、劳动组织的科室人员，就分头深入现场，和车间工段的工人管理员一起，从检查当季当月的生产操作、原料消耗和设备运转等情况入手，结合下月下季的原料、设备、气候等条件的变化，对下一期的生产进行分析。在分析当中，提出为下期生产作些什么准备工作，怎样进行准备，然后再交给全厂职工讨论。最后由工厂领导上集中起来，制成一个为下期生产作准备的行动计划。各部门根据准备工作的计划，进行具体的准备工作。这样，一进入下季或下月，就可以立即按照作业计划组织生产。
    这样做的好处是：首先，由于领导和群众一起对客观上各种实际情况的变化进行了认真的调查研究，就能准确地抓住未来生产中的关键，使准备工作有的放矢。今年年初，当他们在分析当时生产中发现提高成品率和作业率，是保证烧结机的利用系数赶上国内先进水平的两大关键问题时，全厂职工立即掀起了一个改进操作和加强设备维护工作的高潮。职工们先后订出了二十五套操作要点和加强五十五处薄弱环节的方案。执行的结果，使3月份烧结机的利用系数比2月份提高了20.5％。其次，可以使技术措施的制订和实现赶前赶早，比较快地在生产上发挥作用。冶金工业部今年3月决定调给这个厂一部分含硫高、粒度细的矿粉。这个厂为了找出脱硫和造球烧结的规律，职工们研究了六种方案，进行了一百多次试验，结果找出了合适的配料比例，使第二季度顺利地使用了这种矿粉。今年10月为11月生产制订的十七项措施中，有六项在10月底提前实现，八项在11月份内按期实现。这就使11月份的生产全面超额完成了国家计划。第三，工人群众既参加生产，又参加准备，许多措施一经确定之后，就能比较迅速比较准确地贯彻执行。今年8月，这个厂的领导干部和技术人员在深入现场进行分析活动中，发现烧结矿的含铁量有波动，这是9月份需要解决的一个关键问题。他们在对三班操作进行了现场观察、比较以后，看到三个班的生产操作各有优点，经过把群众的点滴经验总结、配套、推广以后，烧结矿的质量稳定了。结果使9月份烧结矿的质量合格率比8月提高了2.84％。
    这个厂对生产进行分析活动，现在已经形成制度。在制定下一个月计划之前，他们不仅要派人到公司内部的供销处、焦化厂、运输部、机械厂等单位了解原料的供应、运输、品种质量的变化和备件的制作等情况，而且还要到炼铁厂了解高炉对烧结生产的意见，定期和全国各烧结厂交换技术情报，对比先进指标和学习先进经验，然后组织生产。全厂每季都要对设备进行一次保安大检查，发现薄弱环节，订出改进办法。每月都要检查备件库存情况，安排下月备件制作计划，并根据设备损耗情况安排预修计划。为了使工作更能适应生产的变化，他们在每次检修前三天还要系统检查准备工作情况，每旬的计划也要根据情况随时进行调整。工人群众在日常生产中也实行了“派尖兵”的办法，即每天上班前派人到上下左右各个工序了解情况，订出当班的措施。原料和运输、配料和烧结、生产和修理等各个工种和工序之间，还建立了互相“预报”情况的制度。这样，就使工厂的企业管理工作有了章法，做到瞻前顾后，紧而不乱，在各项工作中赢得了主动。
    目前这个厂正在争取更多地完成当前生产任务的同时，积极为明年的生产进行准备工作。（附图片）
