Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, December 21st: The Guinean government announced this afternoon a joint statement by the Republic of Guinea, the Republic of Ghana, and the United Arab Republic regarding the situation in the Congo, demanding that the United Nations authorities immediately release Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba and restore the power of the Congo's legitimate government.

The joint statement said, "The Republic of the Congo, which recently appeared on the international stage as an independent sovereign state, became the object of a serious conspiracy orchestrated by imperialism to deprive it of its sovereignty, undermine its unity, and restore imperialist rule in the early days of its independence."

The joint statement exposed the role played by the United Nations in the Congo, saying, "Less than two months after the United Nations forces were sent to the Congo, the legitimate Congolese government headed by Lumumba was deprived of its legitimate right to exercise its functions, and the Prime Minister himself suffered torture and abuse in the presence of the United Nations. The legally elected parliament of the Congolese people suffered the same fate, with members of parliament being expelled and subjected to all kinds of unreasonable treatment."

The three countries demanded in the joint statement that the United Nations "immediately release Lumumba, the Prime Minister of the legitimate government, restore the power of the administrative authorities that existed in the Congo before the United Nations intervened, that is, restore the official power of the Congo's legitimate government, and convene the Congolese parliament elected through elections according to the constitution, so that the parliament and the government can assume their responsibilities."

This joint statement was unanimously agreed upon by the heads of the three states after repeated contacts regarding the Congo situation and its development. The three countries agreed to release the statement simultaneously in Cairo, Accra, and Conakry on the 21st.

Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: Stanleyville dispatch: Congolese Acting Prime Minister Gizenga sent a telegram to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 22nd, condemning the "UN forces" for colluding with Mobutu's rebel troops in slaughtering the Congolese people.

The telegram said that the United Nations authorities in the Congo had obstructed the legitimate Lumumba government from dispatching troops to Katanga Province and other areas to maintain law and order, but condoned Mobutu's continued use of Belgian Sabena Airlines planes to transport his troops to various parts of the Republic of the Congo to suppress patriotic people.

The telegram pointed out that the United Nations is now also colluding with Mobutu's troops in Kikwit and other areas, and that Mobutu's troops are massacring Congolese patriots who support Lumumba in Kikwit.

The telegram demanded an immediate halt to Mobutu's actions of transporting rebel troops to various parts of the country.

It is reported that under the protection of the United Nations authorities, the Kalonji traitor group in Kasai Province is actively expanding its reactionary army. Kalonji revealed in Brazzaville on the 22nd that he had telegraphed Mobutu, proposing to merge his reactionary army and Tshombe's army with Mobutu's army to carry out rebellious activities.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 20th: Salumu, the head of the delegation of the legitimate Congolese government currently visiting Cairo, sent a telegram to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld and the President of the Security Council yesterday, condemning the United States and other Western countries and the United Nations authorities for colluding together in an attempt to reconquer the Congo.

The telegram said that the United Nations is playing the game of the United States and Western countries that are coveting the Congo's resources. "They are doing everything possible to try to reconquer our country by supporting the hypocritical actions of Belgium, which acted as their agent in the Congo during the colonial period. The Western countries, led by the United States, are providing the Kasavubu-Mobutu group with automatic weapons, aircraft, and ammunition to eliminate Congolese nationalists, because these nationalists are merely demanding strict respect for the sovereignty of their country. These weapons are shipped to the port of Matadi every day, and massacres are taking place every day."

The telegram protested against the United Nations authorities' decision to send a so-called conciliation commission to the Congo without releasing Prime Minister Lumumba. The telegram said, "After many twists and turns and the adoption of many despicable means, you have decided to send a conciliation commission to the Congo without first releasing Lumumba, the representative of the vast majority of the Congolese people. We consider your action to be 'arbitrary,' and we will never consider the report produced by this conciliation commission if Lumumba is not free to express his views." The telegram also emphasized, "If Lumumba is not released, our people in Orientale Province will sever all relations with the United Nations."

Xinhua News Agency: Public opinion in Asian and African countries strongly condemns the imperialist, especially American, conspiracy against the Congo.

Indonesia's largest trade union, the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union, issued a statement calling on workers to condemn the conspiracies planned by American and Belgian imperialists against the Congo, and strongly protested against the actions and attitudes of the United Nations Secretary-General and the "UN forces" in the Congo in supporting the imperialist conspiracy against the Congo.

The statement expressed support for the recent statements by President Sukarno and President Nasser demanding that the legitimate Congolese government led by Prime Minister Lumumba be free to exercise its functions without interference. The statement demanded that the Indonesian government immediately take measures to ensure that Prime Minister Lumumba is released and not subjected to abuse by the Mobutu terrorist group.

The Association of African Students in India sent a delegation to the United States Embassy in India to deliver a memorandum to the President of the United States, accusing the United States government of protecting the Belgian government's brutal and heinous activities against the Congo and the African people.

The Nigerian and Cameroonian National Congress Youth Vanguard strongly condemned the United Nations' action in the Congo as a tool of the United States State Department, and accused the United States government and Belgium of conducting a planned conspiracy to attack the legitimate Prime Minister Lumumba.

The Nigerian *West African Pilot* published two articles condemning the shameful role played by the United Nations in the Congo. An article signed by Sanya said that the current chaotic situation in the Congo was created by Belgium and prolonged by the United Nations, in effect, by the United States.

An article signed by Fayokun pointed out that "all the events in the Congo are conspiracies of some major powers with vested interests in the Congo." The author called for an end to Mobutu's activities, the release of Lumumba, and the restoration of his position.

Senegal's *Black African Echo* said in an article that the lessons of the Congo show that colonialists are committed to dividing the African people and making them oppose each other. The newspaper called on the African people to pay attention to the danger of American neo-colonialism, which seeks to "Marshallize Africa."

    几内亚、加纳和阿联发表联合声明谴责帝国主义干涉刚果
    要求恢复刚果合法政府权力释放卢蒙巴
    刚果代总理基赞加谴责“联合国军”勾结蒙博托叛军屠杀人民
    新华社科纳克里21日电　几内亚政府在今天下午公布的几内亚共和国、加纳共和国和阿拉伯联合共和国一项关于刚果局势的联合声明中，要求联合国当局立即使刚果总理卢蒙巴获得释放，并恢复刚果合法政府的权力。
    联合声明说，“作为独立主权国家最近出现在国际舞台上的刚果共和国，在它获得独立的初期，就成为帝国主义为了剥夺它的主权、破坏它的统一和恢复帝国主义统治而策划的严重阴谋的对象。”
    联合声明揭露联合国在刚果所起的作用说，“联合国军派到刚果之后不到两个月，以卢蒙巴为首的刚果合法政府就被剥夺了行使职能的合法权利，总理本人则在联合国目睹的情况下遭受折磨和虐待。刚果人民选举产生的合法议会遭到了同样的命运，议会的议员们被驱逐，蒙受各式各样的无理对待。”
    三国在联合声明中要求联合国“立即使合法政府的总理卢蒙巴获得释放，恢复联合国进行干涉之前在刚果存在的行政当局的权力即恢复刚果合法政府的正式权力，召开根据宪法通过选举产生的刚果议会，使议会和政府能担负起自己的责任”。
    这项联合声明是三国元首就刚果局势及其发展多次进行接触后一致同意发表的。三国商定21日在开罗、阿克拉和科纳克里同时发布这项声明。
    新华社23日讯　斯坦利维尔消息：刚果代理总理基赞加22日致电联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，谴责
  “联合国军”同屠杀刚果人民的蒙博托叛军勾结。
    电报说，在刚果的联合国当局曾经阻挠卢蒙巴合法政府派遣军队到加丹加省和其他地区维持法律和秩序，却纵容蒙博托继续使用比利时萨贝那航空公司的飞机把他的部队运往刚果共和国各地镇压爱国人民。
    电报指出，联合国现在还在基奎特和其他地区同蒙博托军队勾结，而蒙博托军队在基奎特屠杀支持卢蒙巴的刚果爱国者。
    电报要求立即制止蒙博托把叛乱军队运往全国各地的行动。
    据报道，在联合国当局的庇护下，开赛省的卡隆吉叛国集团正在积极扩充他的反动军队。卡隆吉22日在布拉柴维尔透露，他已经打电报给蒙博托，主张把他的反动军队和冲伯的军队同蒙博托的军队汇合起来，进行叛乱活动。
    据新华社开罗20日电　正在开罗访问的刚果合法政府代表团负责人萨卢谬昨天打电报给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德和安全理事会主席，谴责美国等西方国家和联合国当局勾结一起，企图重新征服刚果。
    电报说，联合国正在玩弄着垂涎刚果富源的美国和西方国家的把戏。“它们千方百计地试图通过支持在殖民时期充当它们在刚果的经纪人——比利时的假仁假义行动，重新征服我们的国家。以美国为首的西方国家正在为卡萨武布—蒙博托集团提供自动武器、飞机和弹药来消灭刚果的民族主义者，因为这些民族主义者只不过要求严格尊重他们国家的主权。每天都有这种武器运到马塔迪港，每天都在进行屠杀。”
    电报对联合国当局在不释放卢蒙巴总理的情况下决定派遣一个所谓调解委员会去刚果，表示抗议。电报说，“在经过许多周折和采取许多恶劣手段以后，你们决定派遣一个调解委员会前往刚果，而未能事先释放绝大多数刚果人民的代表卢蒙巴。我们认为你们的这种行动是‘专横的’，如果卢蒙巴不能自由地发表他的意见，我们将决不考虑这个调解委员会制作的报告”。电报还强调指出，“如果卢蒙巴不获释，我们在东方省的人们将断绝同联合国的一切关系。”
    据新华社讯　亚非国家公众舆论强烈谴责帝国主义、特别是美国对刚果的阴谋。
    印度尼西亚最大的工会、全印度尼西亚中央职工会发表声明，号召工人们谴责美帝国主义者和比利时帝国主义者对刚果策划的阴谋，并严重抗议联合国秘书长和在刚果的“联合国军”支持帝国主义针对刚果的阴谋的行动和态度。
    声明表示支持苏加诺总统和纳赛尔总统最近发表的要求使卢蒙巴总理领导的刚果合法政府自由行使职权而不受干涉的声明。声明要求印度尼西亚政府立即采取措施，使卢蒙巴总理获释并不受蒙博托恐怖集团的虐待。
    在印度的非洲大学生协会派了一个代表团向美国驻印度大使馆递交了一项致美国总统的备忘录，指责美国政府包庇比利时政府反对刚果和非洲人民的残暴的和可恶的活动。
    尼日利亚和喀麦隆国民会议党青年先锋队严厉谴责联合国在刚果充当美国国务院工具的行动，并指责美国政府和比利时进行有计划的阴谋活动打击合法总理卢蒙巴。
    尼日利亚《西非向导报》登载两篇文章谴责联合国在刚果所起的可耻作用。萨尼亚署名的一篇文章说，目前刚果的混乱局势是比利时制造，由联合国、实际上是美国使之长期存在的。
    法约昆署名的一篇文章指出，
  “刚果发生的所有事件都是一些在刚果拥有既得利益的大国的阴谋活动。”作者要求制止蒙博托的活动，释放卢蒙巴和恢复他的地位。
    塞内加尔的《黑非洲回声报》在一篇文章中说，刚果的教训表明，殖民主义者致力于分裂非洲人民，使他们互相对立。报纸要求非洲人民注意力求“使非洲马歇尔化”的美国新殖民主义的危险性。
