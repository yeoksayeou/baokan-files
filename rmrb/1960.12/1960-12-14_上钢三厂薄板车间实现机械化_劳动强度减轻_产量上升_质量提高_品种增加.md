Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai. Workers in the thin plate workshop of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, through the technical innovation and technological revolution movement this year, have transformed the entire workshop's production landscape. Since the first rolling mill achieved mechanization in July, output has increased month by month, quality has greatly improved, variety has significantly expanded, the operating rate has remained stable at around 91%, and production capacity has exceeded the designed level by more than one time. This workshop has become one of the nine rolling steel red banner workshops recently selected in the city.

This workshop has a total of six rolling mills. Originally, the process of rolling thin steel plates was complicated and labor-intensive. In order to change this situation, the workshop's Party general branch enthusiastically supported the workers' strong desire to get rid of heavy physical labor, boldly and practically leading them to carry out technical innovations. They first chose to start the innovation on the No. 3 rolling mill, and selected a group of workers and technicians from various sections to participate. Everyone studied, designed, trial-produced, and improved together, using wooden boards, angle iron, and asphalt barrels to make more than ten models. After learning from each other's strengths and making up for weaknesses, they determined a model, and then, following the order of first doing the front of the machine, then the rollers, and then the back of the machine, they broke through each level and carefully solved each problem.

Soon, the No. 3 rolling mill achieved mechanized production, greatly reducing the workers' physical labor. However, when mechanized production was first achieved, the rolling mill's operating rate and output decreased, and the situation did not improve for a week. The workshop's Party organization mobilized workers to analyze the reasons for the low output and found that the main reasons for the reduction in production were that the workers had not yet mastered the performance of the new machine, were not skilled in operation, and did not cooperate well with each other; the machine itself was not perfect; and the operators did not understand maintenance, resulting in many accidents. The Party organization immediately organized forces to solve these problems one by one. After two months of persistent experimentation and improvement, the operating rate of the No. 3 rolling mill's mechanized production finally increased from 40% to 91%.

Next, they reformed the remaining five rolling mills. Because they had accumulated experience on the No. 3 rolling mill and trained their skills, they could generally put each rolling mill into normal production within a week, and the production effect was better than the previous one. For example, on the third day of production after the No. 5 rolling mill was reformed, the output of thin plates rolled by the first shift workers in eight hours far exceeded the output of the No. 3 rolling mill. The No. 4 rolling mill followed closely, not only exceeding the output of the No. 5 rolling mill, but also, due to further reform of the equipment, the length of the rolled thin plates increased from two meters to four meters; the rolling was increased from one piece at a time to four pieces, and eight pieces at a time, which could not only reduce the thickness of the steel plate and roll precision varieties, but also increase output, further solving the contradiction between expanding varieties and increasing output. By November 24, all six rolling mills in the workshop had achieved mechanization.

After the realization of mechanization, the physical labor of the workers in this workshop was greatly reduced. They no longer needed to hold heavy tongs and clamp the red-hot steel plates to the rolling mill for rolling, but only needed to press the button and watch beside the automatic conveyor belt to carry out production. Originally, each rolling mill required more than thirty workers, but now it can be reduced by about half. Without adding a single worker, the entire workshop opened two more rolling mills, and the quality of the thin plates has also greatly improved. For the most widely used type of thin plate with a thickness of 0.5 meters, there were originally very few first-class products, but now the first-class products account for about 90%, and the highest reaches 98%.

    上钢三厂薄板车间实现机械化
    劳动强度减轻　产量上升　质量提高　品种增加
    据新华社上海讯　上海第三钢铁厂薄板车间职工在今年技术革新技术革命运动中，改变了整个车间的生产面貌。从7月份第一部轧机实现机械化以来，产量逐月上升，质量大大提高，品种显著增多，作业率始终稳住在91％左右，生产能力已超过设计水平一倍以上，1月到10月的产量比去年同期增长了316％。这个车间成为全市最近评出的九个轧钢红旗车间之一。
    这个车间共有六部轧机。原来轧制薄钢板工序繁杂，劳动强度很大。为了改变这种状况，车间党总支热情支持工人摆脱繁重体力劳动的强烈愿望，大胆而又切实地领导他们进行技术革新。他们首先选择在三号轧机上开始革新，并从各个工段抽调一批工人和技术人员参加。大家边研究、边设计、边试制、边改进，用木板、三角铁、柏油桶等做成十多个模型，经过取长补短确定了一种模型之后，又按照先搞机前、后搞轧辊、再搞机后的次序，一关一关地突破，一个问题一个问题地认真解决。
    不久，三号轧机就实现了机械化生产，工人的体力劳动大大减轻。但是刚实现机械化生产时，轧机的作业率和产量都降低了，情况连续一个星期没有好转。车间党组织发动工人对产量不高的原因作了分析，发现减产的主要原因，是工人对新机器的性能还未掌握，操作不熟练，互相配合不好；机器本身还不完善；操作工人不懂维修保养，事故多。党组织又立即组织力量，一个一个地认真解决这些问题。经过两个月坚持不懈的试验改进，三号轧机机械化生产的作业率终于从40％提高到91％。
    接着，他们就对其余五部轧机进行改革。由于在三号轧机积累了经验，技术上练了兵，因此改革每部轧机，一般一个星期就能正常生产，而且生产效果一台比一台更好。如五号轧机改革后生产的第三天，甲班工人在八小时内轧制薄板的产量，就远远超过了三号轧机的产量。四号轧机又跟踪追上，不但产量超过了五号轧机，而且由于进一步改革了设备，轧制的薄板由原来的二米长，增加到四米长；由一片一轧提高到四片、八片一轧，既能降低钢板厚度，能轧制精密品种，又能提高产量，进一步解决了扩大品种与提高产量的矛盾。到11月24日止，全车间的六部轧机都已经实现了机械化。
    实现机械化以后，这个车间工人的体力劳动大大减轻，他们不再需要拿着笨重的钳子，夹着红钢板送到轧机上去轧制，而只要按按电钮，看守在自动运输带的旁边，就可以进行生产了。原来每部轧机需要三十几个工人，现在可以减少一半左右，在没有增加一个工人的情况下，全车间多开了两部轧机，薄板质量也大有提高，就用途最广的一种零点五米厚度的薄板来说，原来极少一级品，现在一级品达90％左右，最高达到98％。
