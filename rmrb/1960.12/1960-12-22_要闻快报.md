Seize Every Day at Year's End, Produce More Steel to Welcome the New Year

Anshan Iron and Steel Launches Year-End Decisive Battle Competition

The entire workforce of Anshan Iron and Steel is seizing every day at the end of the year, striving to produce more steel. After workers in each steelmaking plant formulated plans for each ten-day period, each day, and each shift in December, they immediately launched a high-yield, high-quality competition. As a result of the competition between plants, between large teams, and between open-hearth furnaces, the average daily steel output in the first fourteen days of December increased by more than 13% compared to late November.

Shanghai Steel Continues to Achieve New Records

Since December, steel plants in Shanghai have continuously set new daily output records, and major steelmaking workshops have completed their production tasks day after day. As of the 15th, the city's steel output had completed 50.3% of the monthly plan, with improved quality and continued decline in iron consumption. Since the 6th, Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 has been exceeding its plan every day. The No. 2 Converter Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 has also successively organized competitions with unity of purpose between furnace operators, and great coordination between shifts. Since December, this workshop has repeatedly created the highest daily output record of the year. Employees of each plant have also launched a vigorous campaign to save iron, coal (coke), and electricity, further promoting the increase in steel production through conservation.

Taiyuan Iron and Steel Launches Competition to Welcome the New Year

Employees of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company launched a competition of "Everyone Creating a New Achievement to Welcome 1961." New production records for each shift and each day have been constantly emerging in recent days. The average daily steel output for the first five days of mid-December increased sharply by more than 20% compared to the average daily output of early December.

Wuhan Iron and Steel Launches Equipment Safe Operation Campaign

Since December 12th, the workers of Wuhan Iron and Steel's steelmaking plant have launched a safe equipment operation with no accidents campaign. In the first five days of the campaign, the average daily output of open-hearth furnaces has increased by 8% compared to the average daily output of early December.

Yunnan Iron and Steel Front Strives for Comprehensive Leap Forward

While striving to complete the annual plan ahead of schedule, the employees of Yunnan's iron and steel front paid special attention to improving quality, increasing variety, and reducing the consumption of coal, coke, and pig iron. In early December, the average qualified rate of steel in the province increased by 1.5% compared to November, and the variety of steel also increased. Each blast furnace also promoted a fixed-quota contract system for coke, making extensive use of coke fines without affecting blast furnace production, so that the total coke ratio for ironmaking was reduced again and again.

Chongqing Iron and Steel Focuses on the First Shift Every Day

In the mass movement to comprehensively overfulfill the annual plan, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, at the four levels of company, plant, workshop, and team, focuses on the first shift every day, and on the first two hours of each shift, specifically implementing the guiding ideology of "grasping tightly from beginning to end," so that production rises evenly. The output of the first four hours of each shift in the No. 1 Converter Plant has increased from 20% to 30% of the total shift output in the past to about 50%.

Dalian Port Bravely Transports Ore in Severe Cold

Dalian Port workers resisted the difficulties brought about by the severe cold, actively transported materials, and supported the production of Anshan Iron and Steel. In early December, the average daily volume of ore and ore powder sent to Anshan Iron and Steel increased by 31.7% compared to November, and the loading and unloading efficiency increased by 23% compared to the same period in November, comprehensively completing the transportation plan to support Anshan Iron and Steel.
