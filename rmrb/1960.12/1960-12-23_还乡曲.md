Homecoming Song

Is the driver comrade driving the car too slowly? Or is the returning home heart as impatient as an arrow? One pole, two poles, rows of telephone poles flashing backward. One glance sees the small hill of the hometown, and the heart beats even faster. Tears, ah, don't rush out of the eyes, let me take a closer look at my hometown. Erli Village, Shili Shop, the golden, flat, wide road. Yangjia Dianzi Willow Forest Village, the silver, bright reservoir is like a treasure bowl. Qingxing Valley Baicao Depression, layers of terraced fields connecting to the clouds. Red brick walls and blue-gray tiles, the whole village lives in happy families. From afar I see the "Tomb of Ten Thousand People," and tears as big as beans roll down. Thousand-year blood debts and ten-thousand-year hatred, Japanese devils killed our loved ones. Under the crooked-neck locust tree at the village entrance, the villagers held meetings to fight against the local bullies. The five-star flag fluttered red in the sky, and poor brothers raised the flagpoles high. At that time, half of the sky was bright and half was dark, away from my hometown to the south… For more than ten years away from home, I think about it day and night. Every plant and tree is a new atmosphere, and the dreams I saw have all come true. The long-separated son has returned again, and the Party's words are kept in mind. Grandpa's axe, Dad's hoe, the sickle and rake are still familiar. Used to holding the steering wheel of a car, I want to drive a tractor to plow the land. Having lived in the South for more than ten autumns, I also want to call the North to have two harvests… Thinking about it so much that I'm mesmerized, my eyes fixed, the car stops in front of the door. Magpies perch on branches and chirp, the old mother leans on the door frame and smiles. Walking forward and shouting loudly: "Mom, your native son has come home to farm!"

    还乡曲
    刘章是司机同志的汽车开的慢？还是回乡人心儿急似箭？一根根杆，两根根杆，一排排电线杆子往后闪。一眼望见家乡小山包，心口儿跳的更厉害了。泪珠啊莫急着出眼角，让我把家乡仔细瞧。二里庄，十里铺，金闪闪坦平大公路。杨家店子柳林村，银亮亮水库像聚宝盆。青杏沟子白草洼，层层梯田连云霞。红堂堂砖墙青灰瓦，满庄住的是幸福人家。老远望见“万人坟”，豆大的泪珠往下滚。千年血债万年恨，日本鬼子杀亲人。村头头歪脖子槐树下，乡亲们开会斗恶霸。五星大旗飘红了天，穷哥们高举大旗杆。那时候，半边天明半边暗，远离乡亲下江南……一别家乡十几年，天天想来夜夜盼。根根草木气象新，梦里头见的都实现。久别的人儿又回来，党的话儿记心怀。爷爷的斧，爹的锄，镰刀耙子还使的熟。握惯了汽车方向盘，要开动拖拉机把地翻。江南住了十几秋，也要叫塞北两季收……想的入迷了，看的眼直了，汽车在门前停住了。喜鹊登枝喳喳的叫，老妈妈依着门框笑。走进前使劲喊声：“妈，土生子回家来种庄稼！”
