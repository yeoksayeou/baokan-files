    Scrap Metal Turns into Tractors
    "Big Yellow Ox" Shows Might in the Fields
    In the fields of the German Democratic Republic, a batch of iron oxen are demonstrating their power, obeying their masters' will to wage war on the land, compelling it to yield more grain.
    These iron oxen are the new crawler tractors produced by the Brandenburg Tractor Factory. Its trademark pattern is a strong big yellow ox. When people see these huge, flexible, and beautiful tractors, who would think that these thirty-five new tractors were transformed from scrap bins?
    It turns out that the workers of the Brandenburg Tractor Factory, in response to the call of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany to save raw materials, formulated a plan at the beginning of the year to save 240 tons of materials. The factory workers tried every possible means to tap potential and find tricks, and finally saved about 240 tons of materials and used these scraps to manufacture thirty-five tractors.
    Skilled Craftsmen Have Many Ideas
    The working collective led by Engineer Pruschmann fired the first shot in the implementation of the saving plan. After receiving the saving task, everyone worked together to use their brains and tap the potential for saving and increasing production. They found that the factory's past material cutting method wasted a lot of materials. A sheet of iron is cut into six pieces: first cut into three long strips, and then cut in half, so each strip will leave a piece of scrap. They thought: if the transverse cutting is changed to straight cutting, so that the remaining scrap is not three pieces but one piece, wouldn't it save materials? Based on this idea, they carried out intense and arduous work, drawing more than 1,000 iron sheet cutting diagrams. By cutting diagrams of only eight to twenty millimeters, they saved 37,000 marks in the first half of the year alone.
    In addition, this working collective also used strip steel instead of thin iron plates. The width of the strip steel is the same as the width of the parts, so it is possible to cut almost without loss. They also created a card index method, that is, to register all the scrap of iron sheet on the card, so that it can be used to manufacture various required parts.
    The advanced experience of the Pruschmann working collective has been promoted in fraternal factories. This working collective has already formulated a plan to save 276,000 marks next year.
    Flowers of Inter-Factory Collaboration
    Ihlenfeldt, the foreman of the box cover workshop of the Brandenburg Tractor Factory, and inspector Schwarz are also skilled at finding tricks. They do not deal with thin iron sheets, but with a solid cast steel part inside the tractor - the box cover. In this part, ordinary people think there is no potential to be tapped. But they looked more carefully and further. They saw that the ten-millimeter cast steel of the box cover could also be "slimmer." Of course, these cast steel parts were not made in their own factory, but could be solved through inter-factory collaboration.
    Comrade Ihlenfeldt reflected their opinions to Comrade Leinert of the purchasing department. As a result, the tractor factory invited guests from the Leipzig Steel Plant and the Torgelow United Foundry to conduct research together. Everyone calculated each plane and each edge of the cast steel one by one, firing at every millimeter of excess. Through discussion, the result was that five millimeters could be planed off the cast steel. Using this cast steel, 236 marks can be saved for each box cover, and 88,000 marks can be saved in a year. Not only saves materials, but also reduces processing time and saves tools. In the past, the wide front of the box cover needed to be rough-turned three times and finely-turned once. Now, rough-turning once and fine-turning once is enough. (Attached picture)

### 废料变成拖拉机

    废料变成拖拉机
    “大黄牛”扬威田间
    在德意志民主共和国的田野，一批铁牛正在大显威力，它们听从主人的意志，要向大地开战，逼令它献出更多粮食。
    这批铁牛就是布兰登堡拖拉机厂生产的新式履带式拖拉机。它的商标图案是一条健壮的大黄牛。当人们看到这批巨大、灵活、美观的拖拉机时，谁会想到，这三十五台新式拖拉机是从废料箱里变出来的呢？
    原来，布兰登堡拖拉机厂职工响应德国统一社会党中央关于节约原材料的号召，在年初制订了节约二百四十吨材料的计划。这个厂的职工千方百计地挖潜力，找窍门，终于节约了约二百四十吨材料，并利用这些下脚料制造了三十五台拖拉机。
    能工巧手计谋多
    普吕希曼工程师领导的工作集体在执行节约计划方面打响了第一炮，他们在接受了节约任务后，大家一起开动脑筋，挖掘节约增产潜力。他们发现，过去工厂的裁料法浪费材料很多。一张铁皮剪成六块：先截成三长条，然后再一分为二，这样每一条都会留下一块废料。他们想：如果把横切改为直切，使剩余的废料不是三块而是一块，不是能节约材料吗？根据这个设想，他们进行了紧张的、繁重的工作，画出了一千多张铁皮截切图。仅仅通过八至二十毫米的截切图，在上半年就节约了三万七千马克。
    另外，这个工作集体还利用带钢代替薄铁板。带钢的宽度和零件的宽度一样，因而就有可能几乎毫无损失地剪裁。他们还创造了卡片索引法，即把铁皮下脚料都登记在卡片上，以便用来制造各种需要的零件。
    普吕希曼工作集体的先进经验已经在兄弟厂推广。这个工作集体已经订出了明年节约二十七万六千马克的计划。
    厂际协作的花朵
    布兰登堡拖拉机厂箱盖车间的工长伊伦费特和检查员施瓦茨也是找窍门的能手。他们不是和薄铁皮打交道，而是和拖拉机内部的一个坚实的铸钢部件——箱盖打交道。在这个部件里，一般人认为没有潜力可挖了。可是他们却看得更仔细、更远。他们看到，箱盖的十毫米铸钢还可以“苗条”一些。当然，这些铸钢不是本厂造的，但可以通过厂际协作来解决。
    伊伦费特同志向采购部的赖英德同志反映了他们的意见。结果拖拉机厂邀请了来比锡钢铁厂、托格洛联合翻砂厂的客人们一起来进行研究。大家对铸钢的每一平面、每一条边缘都逐一进行计算，向每一毫米多余的部分开火。通过讨论，结果使铸钢可刨去五毫米。利用这种铸钢，制造每个箱盖可以节省二百三十六马克，一年可以节省八万八千马克。不但节省了材料，而且减少了加工时间，节省了工具。过去，箱盖的宽大正面需要粗车三次、细车一次。现在粗车一次，细车一次就够了。（附图片）
