    At the Dock
    The cold winter has brought many difficulties to the dock workers who do loading and unloading work. Since late November, the temperature at the dock has dropped below zero. On November 26th, the sea wind howled at the dock, and the waves rose high, making it difficult to stand. But when we heard that we were unloading ore destined for Anshan Iron and Steel today, everyone was full of energy and ran towards the cargo ship against the biting sea wind. After boarding the ship, groups competed against groups, and individuals competed against individuals in a heated competition. In just one work shift, we unloaded more than 500 tons of ore powder. Recently, at the Dalian Port Youth Swearing-in Rally and Competition, our group has challenged all the youth of the port. Our competition conditions are, on the basis of completing the annual loading and unloading tasks ahead of schedule, we are determined to overcome wind and snow, not fear the severe cold, and load and unload an additional 14,000 tons of goods for the country before the end of the year, so that Dalian Port is unimpeded, and the "food" of steel is transported to the front line of production.

    在码头上
    寒冷的冬天，给在码头上做装卸工作的搬运工人带来了不少困难。从11月下旬开始，码头上的气温已经下降到零度以下。11月26日那一天，码头上海风呼啸，浪花掀起老高，把人吹得都站不住脚。可是当我们听说今天卸运往鞍钢的矿石时，个个精神抖擞，迎着刺骨的海风向货轮跑去。登船以后，小组对小组、个人对个人展开了热火朝天的对手赛，只在一个工班里就多卸了五百多吨矿粉。最近在全港青年誓师比武大会上，我们小组已经向全港青年提出挑战，我们的竞赛条件是，在提前完成全年装卸任务的基础上，决心战胜风雪，不畏严寒，年终之前再给国家多装卸一万四千吨货物，让大连港畅通无阻，把钢铁“食粮”运送到生产第一线。
