Xinhua News Agency, December 4th: Beijing's vast number of voters are enthusiastically participating in basic-level elections. Voters in the urban areas and some suburban areas that have not yet held elections today solemnly and grandly voted in over seven hundred polling stations to elect representatives to the Fourth District People's Congress.

Everywhere in the city, a joyful scene prevailed. Voters braved the snowy morning and flocked to various polling stations to vote. Many polling stations were decorated with lanterns and colorful flags, displaying huge slogans such as "Long Live the General Line!", "Long Live the Great Leap Forward!", and "Long Live the People's Commune!".

Today, Party and state leaders Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai, Chairman Zhu De, General Secretary Deng Xiaoping, and others participated in the election together with voters from the Zhongnanhai electoral district in Xicheng District. The Zhongnanhai electoral district polling station was set up in Ziguang閣. After Mao Zedong and others voted, they warmly shook hands with Yang Bozhen, Chairman of the Xicheng District Election Committee and First Secretary of the Xicheng District Party Committee, who was conducting election work there. Yang Bozhen extended cordial greetings to Chairman Mao. Other Party and state leaders in Beijing also voted today. Peng Zhen, First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and Mayor of Beijing, and Liu Ren, Second Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, voted at the Dongjiaominxiang electoral district polling station in Dongcheng District.

In today's election, many advanced figures from all fronts who hold high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune were nominated as representative candidates. Among them are skilled workers from the steel-grabbing front, vanguards supporting agricultural production, and good cadres who implement the Party's policies. Ma Xiaoliu, a worker at the Iron Smelting Plant of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, led a team that was a pacesetter for the overall leap forward in the experimental plant. He made outstanding achievements in this year's battle to seize steel, and this time he was nominated as a representative candidate by the workers. Sun Guilan, a "March 8th" Red Banner Holder in Beijing and a production worker at the Erlonglu People's Commune Comprehensive Factory, used to be an ordinary housewife. After participating in the urban people's commune, she became an activist in technical innovation through collective labor and Party education. The voters in her electoral district competed to elect her as a representative. Many candidates are representatives from the previous term. Wang Xiuzhen, the director of the Chayuan Kindergarten who has been continuously re-elected as a district people's representative, has been diligently running the childcare undertaking and was nominated as a representative candidate again this time.

The basic-level elections in Beijing this year began preparations more than a month ago. All electoral districts seriously and conscientiously carried out voter registration and review work, and the list of candidates was fully deliberated and discussed. The vast number of voters were very serious when discussing the candidates.

Most districts and counties in Beijing's remote suburbs had previously conducted elections for representatives to the township and town people's congresses.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 4th: Shanghai's 1960 basic-level elections for district, county, and township people's congresses have been successfully concluded.

Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Song Qingling, and Shanghai Party and government leaders such as Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and Mayor of Shanghai, all voted in basic-level electoral units.

Shanghai's basic-level election work this year was carried out under the excellent situation at home and abroad. All basic-level units widely carried out education on the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, as well as education on socialist democracy, further enhancing the political consciousness of the people. The broad masses of people valued their political rights and actively participated in the elections. According to statistics from Jing'an District, 99.31% of the voters in the district participated in the voting, and many electoral districts had 100% voter turnout.

Among the representatives elected to the basic-level people's congresses this time, many are advanced figures who have emerged on all fronts of socialist construction in the continuous leap forward over the past two years. Nationally renowned innovation heroes Tang Ying, Wang Juanjuan, and Ding Xingqing were all elected as representatives. Under the leadership of the Party, industrialists and businessmen, intellectuals, and members of democratic parties have also made great progress through education on the new situation of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and many of their representatives from the previous term continued to be elected in this election.
