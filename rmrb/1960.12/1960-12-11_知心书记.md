    Intimate Secretary
    Workers at the Linqing City Hardware Factory in Shandong Province call their Party Branch Secretary, Qiao Ziling, their "Intimate Secretary."

    Qiao Ziling eats with the workers in the cafeteria. He noticed that the time spent buying food was too long, so he discussed it with the cafeteria administrators and cooks and made the following suggestions: The cooks would be responsible for delivering food and dishes to workers in the machine workshop, where the production tasks were heavier; for workers in the small farm tool workshop, which was close to the kitchen, workers from the workshop would take turns going to the cafeteria to get food; and the cafeteria would add a window to sell food and dishes to facilitate food purchases for others eating in the cafeteria. After these measures were implemented, the time workers spent eating was reduced by half.

    On October 15th, after a recent rain, Qiao Ziling was working in his office when he felt a chill. He looked up and saw that the window had not been covered with paper. He then thought that the windows in the employee dormitories also had not been covered. So, he immediately found some discarded newspapers and asked someone to buy some paper, and together with several cadres, he went to the employee dormitories to paste paper on the windows. Xi Quan, a trainee at the factory, saw this and said, "The windows in your office haven't been covered yet, but you're covering ours first. You are truly a good cadre of the Party, a good leader of ours."

    知心书记
    山东临清市五金厂工人，称呼他们的党支部书记乔子苓是“知心书记”。
    乔子苓和工人们一起在食堂吃饭。他发现买饭的时间太长，便找食堂管理员和炊事员研究，提出了这样的建议：对生产任务较重的机工车间工人，由炊事员负责送饭送菜；对离伙房近的小农具车间的工人，改为由车间派工人轮流到食堂打饭；另外由食堂增设卖饭菜的窗口，便利其他在食堂吃饭的人买饭。这些办法实行以后，工人们吃饭花费的时间比以前缩短了一半。
    10月15日刚下过雨，乔子苓正在屋里工作，阵阵凉风吹在身上，他抬头一看，窗子还未糊上纸，就想到职工宿舍的窗子也还没有糊，于是马上找了些废报纸，又叫人买来些纸，同几个干部一起动手，到职工宿舍去糊窗户。工厂的学员席全来看见了说：“你们办公室的窗子还没有糊，倒先给俺们糊好了，真是党的好干部，我们的好领导。”
