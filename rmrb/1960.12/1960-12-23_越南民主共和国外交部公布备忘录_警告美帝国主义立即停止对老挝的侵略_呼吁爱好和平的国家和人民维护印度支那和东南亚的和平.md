Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 22nd. The "Memorandum of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the Aggressive Actions of U.S. Imperialism and its Servants Against the Kingdom of Laos," published today by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, points out, "The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam cannot remain indifferent to the aggressive actions of U.S. imperialism and its servants against the Kingdom of Laos. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sternly warns U.S. imperialism and demands that U.S. imperialism and its servants must immediately cease their aggression against the Kingdom of Laos and immediately abandon their conspiracy to carry out military adventures in Southeast Asia. The U.S. government must bear full responsibility for the serious consequences they have caused."

Pan Hien, Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, released this memorandum at a press conference held today.

The memorandum first points out, "The situation in Laos is extremely serious. A new hotbed of war has appeared in Indochina and Southeast Asia. The crisis of spreading conflict is seriously threatening the peace and security of the nations in this region. The aggressive actions of U.S. imperialism, the Thai reactionaries, the South Vietnamese authorities, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and other servants of U.S. imperialism against the Kingdom of Laos must be stopped immediately."

The memorandum says, "The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam calls on the governments and peoples of peace-loving countries in the world to take necessary measures to safeguard the peace of Indochina and Southeast Asia, which is being endangered. As a signatory to the Geneva Agreements on Laos and a neighbor of the Kingdom of Laos, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam considers it necessary to publish this memorandum in order to reveal the truth about the situation in Laos to world public opinion and to express our country's attitude towards the current Laotian issue."

This memorandum, which is more than ten thousand words long, is divided into three parts. The first part of the memorandum exposes the crime of U.S. imperialism actually directly participating in the military offensive launched by the Nosavan-Vong faction against the legitimate government of the Kingdom of Laos, which is pursuing the policy of peace and neutrality proposed by Prince Souvanna Phouma.

The memorandum points out, "U.S. imperialism provides the Nosavan-Vong rebel group with weapons, equipment, food, and aid, and helps them plan military and political conspiracies. U.S. imperialism even directs the rebel group to attack the army of the Kingdom of Laos and sends some soldiers to mix into the rebel group's army to directly participate in the battle. American planes, flown by American and Chiang Kai-shek pilots, constantly transport war materials from Bangkok, Manila, and Taiwan to Savannakhet, Luang Prabang, and Xieng Khouang to supply the rebel group. The evidence recently obtained in North Kading, especially in the battle of the Nosavan group's attack on the capital Vientiane, irrefutably proves that U.S. imperialism, the Thai reactionaries, the South Vietnamese authorities, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique have directly participated in it."

The memorandum points out, "On December 13, 14, and 15, the U.S. Embassy in Vientiane and other agencies used silenced guns to shoot at the army of the Kingdom of Laos and the Laotian combat forces defending Vientiane. During the attack on Vientiane, a U.S. military delegation came to Nong Khai, Thailand, to directly command the Nosavan rebel group. At the same time as the attack on Vientiane, the U.S. Seventh Fleet appeared in the waters of Hue and Toulon in the East Sea. At the same time, U.S. imperialism has stepped up mobilizing all the reactionary forces of the Southeast Asia military aggressive bloc. The Southeast Asia military aggressive bloc held an emergency meeting on December 12 to discuss the conspiracy to directly carry out armed intervention in Laos."

The memorandum then exposes that under the instigation of the United States, the Thai authorities have deployed troops along the Thai-Laotian border, imposed an economic blockade on Vientiane, provoked the army of the Kingdom of Laos, and even sent Thai officers and soldiers to directly participate in the attack on Vientiane, setting up cannons on Thai territory to shell the government army and people of the Kingdom of Laos, causing hundreds of casualties. The Thai reactionaries also sent several senior military officers stationed in Nong Khai, including Major General Shan and Major General Wanlop of the Army, to direct the activities of the Nosavan rebel group.

The memorandum emphasizes, "All the above facts powerfully prove that U.S. imperialism has taken a dangerous step in interfering in Laos's actions, brazenly directly participating in the military actions of the Nosavan rebel group to subvert the legitimate government of Laos. The blatant aggression of U.S. imperialism and its servants against Laos has violated the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Laos, violated the national rights of the Lao people, and hindered the Lao people from following the path of peace, neutrality, national harmony, and a unified country."

The second part of the memorandum lists a large number of facts, exposing the series of actions of imperialism and its servants to undermine the peace, neutrality, national harmony, and national unification of Laos since the restoration of peace in Indochina and the establishment of the Phouma government after the coup launched by patriotic soldiers led by Captain Kong Le.

The memorandum points out, "Since the signing of the Geneva Agreements on Laos in 1954, U.S. imperialism has done everything possible to increasingly wantonly interfere in Laos, especially in the military field, instructing the Laotian rebel group to wantonly undermine the Geneva Agreements. In September 1954, immediately after the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization declared its formation, the United States and its servants brazenly placed Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam under the so-called "protection" of this group. U.S. imperialism has provided Laos with 250 million U.S. dollars in aid, of which 170 million U.S. dollars is military aid, not including the emergency military aid provided to Laos in August 1959."

The memorandum also points out, "For several years, U.S. imperialism has sent hundreds of military advisors and personnel to Laos, deploying them in the Lao Ministry of Defense and even in military regions, battalions, companies, and other units, directly training the Lao army to use American weapons and commanding the Lao army to attack the Lao People's Armed Forces."

The memorandum points out, "It was U.S. imperialism that destroyed the Lao coalition government, established in 1957 and with representatives of the Lao Fighting Units participating, with Prince Souvanna Phouma as Prime Minister. U.S. imperialism has conspired to obstruct the activities of the Lao International Commission, instigated the Lao reactionaries to announce their refusal to fulfill the Geneva Agreements on Laos, surrounded and attempted to eliminate two battalions of the Lao Fighting Units, illegally arrested Prince Souphanouvong and members of the Lao Patriotic Front, and openly launched a civil war in Laos, attempting to eliminate the Lao Patriotic Front and other Lao patriots."

The memorandum then refutes the lies of U.S. imperialism and its Laotian lackeys who slander the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for so-called "aggression against Laos." The memorandum points out, "The fact is that the Laotian situation has been unstable and has become serious for several years, which is mainly caused by the interference and war policy of U.S. imperialism; this is the far-reaching root cause and direct cause of the current war in Laos."

The third part of the memorandum clarifies the consistent position of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on Laos. The memorandum says, "As a signatory to the Geneva Agreements on Laos and a neighbor of the Kingdom of Laos, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently followed a peaceful policy of establishing good neighborly relations with the Kingdom of Laos on basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the spirit of the Bandung Conference.

The Government of Democratic Republic of Vietnam has solemnly respected and thoroughly implemented the Geneva Agreements. After the restoration of peace, the Government of Democratic Republic of Vietnam rapidly and correctly implemented the various provisions regarding the concentration of troops and the withdrawal of volunteer forces in Laos. For the benefit of the consistent friendly relations between the people of Vietnam and Laos, the Government of Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly declared and expressed its very correct attitude."

The memorandum says, "The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sternly condemns to world public opinion the extremely dangerous aggressive acts of U.S. imperialism, the Thai reactionaries, the South Vietnamese authorities, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique against the Government of the Kingdom of Laos. This behavior seriously violates the Geneva Agreements on Laos, threatens the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and its consequences will lead to an extremely serious crisis of a new war in Indochina that endangers peace in the Southeast Asian region and the entire world."

The memorandum reiterates the proposal made by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in its statement issued on December 17 to reconvene a conference of the participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference and to restore the activities of the Lao International Commission. The memorandum points out that convening the above-mentioned meeting "in order to seek to extinguish the flames of war, stop the aggression of U.S. imperialism and its servants against Laos, stabilize the situation in Laos, and guarantee the basic national rights of the Lao people, appears more important and more urgent."

    越南民主共和国外交部公布备忘录
    警告美帝国主义立即停止对老挝的侵略
    呼吁爱好和平的国家和人民维护印度支那和东南亚的和平
    新华社河内22日电　越南民主共和国外交部今天公布的《越南民主共和国政府关于美帝国主义及其仆从对老挝王国的侵略行动的备忘录》指出，“越南民主共和国政府决不能对美帝国主义及其仆从们的对老挝王国的侵略行为置若罔闻。越南民主共和国政府严厉警告美帝国主义，并要求美帝国主义及其仆从必须立即停止对老挝王国的侵略，立即放弃它们企图在东南亚进行军事冒险的阴谋。美国政府必须对它们所造成的严重后果负完全责任。”
    越南民主共和国外交部新闻司司长潘贤在今天举行的记者招待会上公布了这一备忘录。
    备忘录首先指出，“老挝局势极其严重。新的战争温床已在印度支那和东南亚出现。冲突蔓延的危机，正在严重地威胁这个地区各民族的和平和安全。必须立即制止美帝国主义、泰国反动派、南越当局、蒋介石集团和美帝国主义的其它仆从对老挝王国的侵略行动。”
    备忘录说，“越南民主共和国政府呼吁世界上爱好和平国家的政府和人民采取必要措施，以维护正在遭受危害的印度支那和东南亚的和平。越南民主共和国政府作为签订关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的一方和老挝王国的邻国，认为有必要发表这个备忘录，以便向世界舆论揭露老挝局势的真相，并表明我国对目前的老挝问题的态度。”
    这个长达一万多字的备忘录共分三部分。备忘录的第一部分揭露了美帝国主义实际上直接参与诺萨万—文翁叛乱集团向正在奉行富马亲王提出的和平中立政策的老挝王国合法政府发动的军事进攻的罪行。
    备忘录指出，“美帝国主义向诺萨万—文翁叛乱集团提供武器装备、粮食和援款，并帮助他们策划军事和政治阴谋。美帝国主义甚至还指挥叛乱集团进攻老挝王国政府的军队，并派遣一些士兵混进叛乱集团的军队，直接参加战斗。由美国和蒋介石分子的驾驶员驾驶的美国飞机不断地把战争物资从曼谷、马尼拉、台湾运到沙湾拿吉、琅勃刺邦、川圹，供应叛乱集团。最近在北卡定，特别是在诺萨万集团进攻首都万象的战斗中所获得的证据，不容置辩地证明美帝国主义、泰国反动派、南越当局和蒋介石集团曾经直接参与其事。”
    备忘录指出，“12月13、14、15日，美国驻万象大使馆和其它机关，曾使用无声枪向老挝王国军队和保卫万象的寮国战斗部队射击。在进攻万象的时候，一个美国军事代表团曾经来到泰国的廊开，以直接指挥诺萨万叛乱集团。在进攻万象的同时，美国第七舰队曾在东海的顺化和土伦海域出现。与此同时，美帝国主义还加紧把东南亚军事侵略集团的一切反动力量动员起来。东南亚军事侵略集团在12月12日召开紧急会议，讨论了对老挝直接进行武装干涉的阴谋。”
    备忘录接着揭露泰国当局在美国的唆使下，陈兵泰老边界沿线，对万象实行经济封锁，向老挝王国军队进行挑衅，甚至还派遣泰国官兵直接参加对万象的进攻，在泰国的领土上设置大炮，炮击老挝王国政府军和人民，造成数百人伤亡。泰国反动派还派驻廊开的若干名高级军事干部，其中有山少将和陆军少将万洛普，去指挥诺萨万叛乱集团的活动。
    备忘录强调指出，“上述一切事实有力地证明，美帝国主义在干涉老挝的行动中跨出了危险的一步，悍然地直接参加了诺萨万叛乱集团的军事行动，以颠复老挝合法政府。美帝国主义及其仆从对老挝的明目张胆的侵略行为，侵犯了老挝的主权和领土完整，侵犯了老挝人民的民族权利，并阻挠老挝人民遵循和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家的道路。”
    备忘录的第二部分列举大量事实，揭露帝国主义及其仆从自印度支那和平恢复以来和以贡勒大尉为首的爱国士兵发动政变后，富马政府成立以来，破坏老挝的和平中立、民族和睦和国家统一的一系列行动。
    备忘录指出，“自从1954年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议签订之后，美帝国主义就用尽一切办法日益猖狂地对老挝进行干涉，尤其是在军事方面，指使老挝叛乱集团大肆破坏日内瓦协议。1954年9月，紧接着东南亚集团宣告拼凑起来之后，美国及其仆从就悍然地把老挝、柬埔寨、越南南方置于这个集团的所谓“保护”之下。美帝国主义曾经向老挝提供二亿五千万美元的援助，其中有一亿七千万美元是军事援助，而1959年8月向老挝提供的紧急军事援助还不包括在内。”
    备忘录还指出，“几年来，美帝国主义派遣了数以百计的军事顾问和人员前往老挝，把他们布置在老挝国防部以至各军区、营、连等单位，直接训练老挝军队使用美国武器，和指挥老挝军队向老挝人民武装力量进攻。”
    备忘录指出，“正是美帝国主义破坏了1957年成立的、有寮国战斗部队代表参加的、以梭发那·富马亲王为首相的老挝联合政府。美帝国主义曾经阴谋阻挠老挝国际委员会的活动，唆使老挝反动派宣布拒绝履行关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，包围和企图消灭寮国战斗部队的两个营，非法逮捕苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党议员，公然发动老挝内战，企图消灭老挝爱国战线党和老挝的其他爱国人士。”
    备忘录接着驳斥了美帝国主义和它的老挝走狗诬蔑越南民主共和国所谓“侵略老挝”的谎言。备忘录指出，“事实是，几年来老挝局势一直不稳定并变为严重，这主要是美帝国主义的干涉和战争政策所造成的；这是目前老挝发生战争的深远根源和直接原因。”
    备忘录的第三部分阐明了越南民主共和国对老挝的一贯立场。备忘录说，“作为签订关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的一方和老挝王国邻国的越南民主共和国政府，始终如一地遵循在和平共处五项原则和万隆会议精神的基础上同老挝王国建立睦邻关系的和平政策。
    越南民主共和国政府已经严正尊重和彻底履行了日内瓦协议。越南民主共和国政府从和平恢复后，就迅速和正确地实现了关于集结军队和撤回在老挝的志愿军的各项条款。为了越南和老挝两国人民的一贯友好关系的利益，越南民主共和国政府曾经多次声明，表明自己的非常正确的态度。”
    备忘录说，“越南民主共和国政府向世界舆论严厉谴责美帝国主义、泰国反动派、南越当局和蒋介石集团对老挝王国政府的极其危险的侵略行为。这种行为严重地破坏了关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，威胁了越南民主共和国的安全，其后果将导致极其严重地危害东南亚地区和全世界和平的印度支那新战争的危机。”
    备忘录重申了越南民主共和国政府12月17日发表的声明中曾经提出的重新召开1954年日内瓦会议参加国会议和恢复老挝国际委员会的活动的建议。备忘录指出，召开上述会议“以便寻求扑灭战火、制止美帝国主义及其仆从对老挝的侵略、稳定老挝局势、保证老挝人民的基本的民族权利，显得更为重要，更为迫切。”
