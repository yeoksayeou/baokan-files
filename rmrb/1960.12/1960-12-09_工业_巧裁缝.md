    Industrial "Clever Tailors"
    The riveting team of the Fifth Workshop of the Shenyang Fan Factory specializes in numbering and cutting materials. Knowing that they are the "throat" of material distribution for the entire factory, all the workers in the team pay special attention to saving materials.
    Li Shudong, a worker in this team, used to cut volute casing plates for fans, with each steel plate only able to cut one, leaving the other half unusable. He felt this was a great waste. One day, he visited a tailoring shop in the street and was inspired by the tailors' clever cutting and trimming, making beautiful clothes with a small amount of cloth. He thought: Could cutting steel plates be done by cutting the components separately and then welding them together? As soon as he raised this idea, someone said, "Tailors use cloth, but we use steel plates. How can this be done?" However, the Party branch strongly supported him and found an inspector to study with him. Li Shudong improved the sample overnight, cutting the component into two sections, cutting them separately, and then welding them together. As a result, 40% of the steel was saved, and the quality was not affected. Thus, the team produced the first industrial "clever tailor".
    The name "clever tailor" quickly became popular throughout the factory. Everyone felt that the method of clever nesting and cutting was good. No matter what shape the components were, they tried to find ways to cut and trim them cleverly. The old worker Wu Baoshun used to cut volute casing components with a material utilization rate of only 60%. This time, he developed a new material cutting method, saving twenty steel plates in a month.

### 工业“巧裁缝”

    工业“巧裁缝”
    沈阳扇风机厂五车间铆工小组，专管号料、切料。全组工人知道自己是全厂下料的咽喉，特别注意节约用料。
    这个组的工人李树东切风机涡壳板，一张铁板只能切一个，另一半就不能用。他感到这是个大浪费。一天，他到街道缝纫门市部见到缝纫工人巧裁巧剪，用少量布就做出美观的衣服来，很受启发。他想：切钢板，能不能将部件切开裁然后焊上？他这想法刚一提出，有人说：“人家裁缝用的是布，我们用的是铁板，这怎能行呢？”可是党支部大力支持他，找检查员同他一道研究。李树东连夜改进了样板，将部件分两段裁，裁后再焊接上，结果节约了钢材40％，质量也没受影响。于是这个组出了第一个工业“巧裁缝”。
    “巧裁缝”这个名字一传出，立刻在全厂叫响了。人人都感到巧套巧裁的办法好，不管是切什么形状的部件，都想办法巧裁巧剪。老工人吴宝顺过去切涡壳板部件，材料利用率只能达到60％，这次研究出新的裁料方法，一个月就节省二十张钢板。
