    Further Consolidate the System of "Three-Level Ownership, with the Team as the Foundation"
    Jing'an Mobilizes the Masses to Summarize the Experience of Running Communes Well

    (Our Dispatch) According to the Jiangxi Daily: Jing'an County, Jiangxi Province, is extensively and deeply mobilizing the masses in rural areas throughout the county to summarize the experience of the communes.

    This mass activity of summarizing the commune experience began in early November. Cadres at all levels of the county, communes, brigades, and teams, as well as all commune members, actively participated in this activity. The Provincial Party Committee and the Prefectural Party Committee also sent responsible comrades to the grassroots level to guide the summary work. From the outset, they vigorously publicized and implemented the Party's series of policies concerning the people's communes, using large meetings to speak and small meetings to discuss, to deliver the Party's policies to the masses, making them known to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts. At the same time, relying on the masses, combined with the specific situation of the commune and team, they comprehensively and systematically summarized the experience of running the people's communes well over the past two years. Successful experiences were promoted in a timely manner, and good people and good deeds were praised in a timely manner. For shortcomings in the work, they analyzed the reasons, researched methods to overcome them, and thoroughly improved them, so that the people's communes were further consolidated and strengthened.

    The method of summarizing was from point to area, conducted with organized leadership, steps, and plans. Cadres brought policies to the production teams, met directly with commune members, and fully mobilized the masses to discuss. According to statistics, in just half a month, the county's eight communes and two reclamation farms posted more than 1,900 big-character posters and put forward more than 4,000 experiences and opinions on running communes well and improving production, forming a mass movement of "everyone using their brains, everyone looking for experience." For the opinions put forward by the commune members, it was ensured that every item was implemented, every matter was fulfilled, and everyone was satisfied. The broad masses of commune members praised the people's communes as an ironclad state, praised the public canteens as iron-cast rice steamers, and said that the supply system was iron-made rice bowls. Xianghu Brigade of Renshou Commune has increased production and income every year since communization. When they summed up the power of the commune, they said: "With communization, heaven and earth listen to me, production increases every year, and everything is worthwhile." The same is true for many other communes and brigades. Hebei Brigade of Shuangxi Commune produced a total of 1.56 million catties of grain last year, which was a production reduction team; this year, it harvested more than 260,000 catties more than last year, an increase of 17.2%. Through two years of comparison, the commune members found that the main experiences of this year's increased production were three: first, adhering to the "four fixings" of the production team and the basic ownership of the production brigade; second, the "three guarantees and one reward" were fully honored, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the commune members; and third, the guiding ideology was clear, and a series of agricultural production guidelines and policies were implemented. Some communes also compared production units with the same natural conditions but different incomes, and mobilized commune members to analyze the reasons, accept experience, and learn lessons. This form of summary is very vivid, the content is very rich, and the effect is very good. From the preliminary experience summarized in various places, the main point is: to run the people's communes well, it is necessary to further consolidate the system of "three-level ownership, with the team as the foundation" at this stage.

    Through the summary, advanced red flags have been established, and problems have been thoroughly solved. At the same time, a thorough assessment and accounting of this year's income distribution was carried out; the lives of commune members were also comprehensively and reasonably arranged; and the production plan and labor management, "three guarantees and one reward" system, etc. for next year have also been basically determined after repeated discussions by the masses. This summary particularly strengthened the leadership of remote areas and backward units. Shaoqian Brigade of Tangdu Commune was a backward team. This time, it fully implemented policies, summarized experience, and solved outstanding problems, and winter production leaped to become an advanced brigade in the entire commune.

    Because attention was paid to close integration with production from the beginning, the implementation of policies went one step deeper, the summary of experience went one step deeper, and production also advanced one step forward. A new upsurge has now emerged in agricultural production. As of November 23, the county had completed more than 35,000 mu of winter plowing, reclaimed 1,675 mu of wasteland, accumulated more than 1.7 million dan of fertilizer, and managed 66,000 mu of winter seedlings by planting, managing, topdressing, weeding, preventing frost, and preventing freezing.

### 进一步巩固“三级所有、队为基础”的制度  靖安发动群众总结办好公社经验

    进一步巩固“三级所有、队为基础”的制度
    靖安发动群众总结办好公社经验
    本报讯　据江西日报消息：江西省靖安县正在全县农村广泛深入地发动群众，总结公社经验。
    这个群众性的总结公社经验活动，是在11月初开始的。县、公社、大队、小队的各级干部和全体社员都积极参加了这个活动。省委、地委也派了负责同志下到基层，指导总结工作。一开始，就大张旗鼓宣传贯彻党的有关人民公社的一系列的方针政策，通过大会讲，小会谈，把党的政策交给群众，做到家喻户晓，深入人心。同时依靠群众，结合本社、本队情况，全面系统总结两年多来办好人民公社的经验，成功的经验及时推广，好人好事及时表扬；对于工作中的缺点分析原因，研究出克服办法，加以彻底改进，做到经验总结好，问题解决透，使人民公社进一步巩固和加强。
    总结的方法，是由点到面，有组织领导、有步骤、有计划地进行的。干部带政策到生产小队，直接和社员见面，充分发动群众讨论。据统计，全县八个公社、两个垦殖场，仅半个月时间，就贴出大字报一千九百多张，提出有关办好公社、搞好生产的经验和意见四千多条，形成了一个“人人动脑筋、个个找经验”的群众运动。对于社员提出的意见，做到了条条有着落，件件都兑现，人人皆满意。广大社员都称赞人民公社是铁打江山，歌颂公共食堂是铁铸饭甑，说供给制是铁造饭碗。仁首公社象湖大队，公社化以来，年年增产增收，他们总结公社的威力时说：“有了公社化，天地听我话，年年都增产，事事都吃价。”其他许多公社、大队也是如此。双溪公社河北大队，去年粮食总产量一百五十六万斤，是个减产队；今年比去年多收二十六万多斤，增产17.2％。社员们通过两年对比，找到了今年增产的主要经验有三条：一是坚持了生产小队的“四固定”和生产大队的基本所有制；二是“三包一奖”完全兑现，充分调动了社员的积极性；三是指导思想明确，贯彻了一系列的农业生产方针政策。有的公社还把自然条件相同而收入两样的生产单位进行对比，发动社员分析原因，接受经验，吸取教训，这种总结形式很生动，内容很丰富，效果也很好。从各地初步总结的经验来看，千条万条，主要一条是：办好人民公社，在现阶段必须进一步巩固“三级所有、队为基础”的制度。
    通过总结，把先进红旗树立起来了，问题也彻底解决了。同时，对今年的收入分配，进行了摸底核算；社员生活，也作了全面合理的安排；并且对明年的生产计划和劳动管理、“三包一奖”等制度，经过群众反复讨论，也基本上确定下来。这次总结，对边远地区和后进单位，特别加强了领导。塘?公社哨前大队是一个后进队，这次全面贯彻政策，总结经验，解决遗留问题，冬季生产一跃而为全公社的先进大队。
    由于一开头就注意了和生产密切结合，所以政策贯彻深入一步，经验总结深入一步，生产也随着前进一步。现在农业生产上已经呈现了新的高潮。到11月23日止，全县冬耕已完成三万五千多亩，开荒一千六百七十五亩，积肥一百七十多万担，六万六千亩冬苗作物，作到了边种边管，追肥锄草，防霜防冻。
