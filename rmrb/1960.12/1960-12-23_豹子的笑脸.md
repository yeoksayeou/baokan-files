Notes

    De Gaulle delivered a speech on the 11th of this month, touting the upcoming "referendum" farce on the Algerian question and vowing, "No one in the world desires peace more than I do."

    What a "peace-loving" man! Never mind how many people De Gaulle has slaughtered in the colonial war in Algeria since taking office more than two years ago. At the same time as he was giving his speech, thousands upon thousands of peaceful Algerian residents in Algiers, Oran, Constantine, and other places were sacrificing and bleeding under the machine guns, cannons, and even tanks and armored vehicles of the colonial troops and police of the De Gaulle government. Such a horrifying and scandalous bloodbath in Algeria is such a strong and bitter irony to De Gaulle's words of peace on the podium!

    However, for all imperialists and reactionaries, wielding butcher knives and shouting "peace" are their usual tricks. De Gaulle's killing in Algeria is an attempt to force the Algerian people to humiliatingly live as slaves, so that French monopoly groups can continue to exploit, plunder, and enslave. De Gaulle's grand talk of "peace" to the Algerian people is an attempt to induce the Algerian people to be willing to live as slaves, so that French monopoly groups can "peacefully" engage in exploitation, plunder, and enslavement. While boasting of "hoping for peace," De Gaulle confessed without being forced that the ultimate goal of the "peace" plan he intends to implement in Algeria through a "referendum" is for Algeria to be "integrated with France" in all aspects - in other words, to remain under the absolute control of France. Isn't this exactly the goal that De Gaulle wants to achieve by persisting in the colonial war?

    There is a good African proverb that says, "Leopards and goats will never live in the same herd." Even if the leopard can pretend to smile, it will still eat the goat. De Gaulle's shouting "hope for peace" will never deceive the Algerian people.

### 豹子的笑脸

    豹子的笑脸
    戴高乐在本月十一日发表演说，为即将举行的关于阿尔及利亚问题的“公民投票”丑剧大肆吹嘘，并且发誓赌咒地说：“世界上再没有人比我更希望和平的了。”
    好一个“希望和平”的人！且不谈戴高乐上台两年多来在阿尔及利亚的殖民战争中已经屠杀了多少人，就在他发表演说的同时，阿尔及尔、奥兰和君士坦丁等地就有成千上万的阿尔及利亚和平居民在戴高乐政府殖民军警的机枪、大炮甚至坦克和装甲车下牺牲流血。阿尔及利亚这种骇人听闻的流血惨剧，对于戴高乐在讲坛上的和平言词，是多么强烈而辛辣的讽刺啊！
    但是，对于一切帝国主义和反动派来说，手舞屠刀和嘴喊“和平”，原是他们惯用的两手。戴高乐在阿尔及利亚挥刀杀人，是企图迫使阿尔及利亚人民屈辱地处于奴隶地位，好让法国垄断集团继续剥削、掠夺和奴役。戴高乐向阿尔及利亚人民大讲“和平”，则是企图诱使阿尔及利亚人民甘心安于奴隶地位，好让法国垄断集团“和平”地从事剥削、掠夺和奴役。戴高乐在吹嘘“希望和平”的同时，就不打自招地供认，他企图通过“公民投票”在阿尔及利亚实施的“和平”计划，最终目的是要阿尔及利亚在一切方面“同法国结合起来”——换句话说，就是仍旧处于法国的绝对控制之下。这难道不正是戴高乐坚持殖民战争所想达到的目的吗？
    非洲有一句民间谚语说得好：“豹子和山羊绝不会生活在同一个群里。”豹子即使能假扮笑脸，也还是要吃山羊的。戴高乐高喊“希望和平”，也决不能骗过阿尔及利亚人民。
