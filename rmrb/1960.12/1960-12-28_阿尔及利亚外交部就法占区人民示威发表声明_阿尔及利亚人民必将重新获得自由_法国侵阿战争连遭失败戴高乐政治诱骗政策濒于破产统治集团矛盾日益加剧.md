Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 26th: The Foreign Ministry of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria issued a statement here today regarding the mass demonstrations in cities within the French-occupied areas of Algeria, stating that the struggle of the Algerian people in the cities is "a powerful expression of our nation's opposition to any solution that runs counter to national independence."

The statement said, "There is no compromise other than continuing the war and negotiating with the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria on an equal basis. It is futile to think that after seven years of fighting, the Algerian people will allow another country to decide their fate."

The statement pointed out, "The Algerian people have forced the French imperialists to retreat many times, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization cannot save the French imperialists from defeat."

The statement concluded, "The Algerian people believe in themselves, are deeply convinced of the justice of their cause, and have the support of world opinion and French democratic forces. They will regain their freedom and become more united in the struggle against French neo-colonialism."

Xinhua News Agency, December 27th: Oran News: Patriotic residents of Oran, Algeria's second-largest city, continue to oppose French colonial rule with their resolute actions.

Last night, hundreds of Muslims demonstrated in the Victor Hugo district and clashed with French colonial authorities' military police who were carrying out suppression. The masses bravely threw bottles and stones at the military police.

Muslim-owned shops also went on strike to express their opposition to colonial rule.

Due to the people's patriotic demonstrations in this city for four consecutive days, the panicked French colonial authorities have taken strict suppression measures. The authorities announced that the curfew would begin two hours earlier starting on the 27th (from 9:00 PM to 4:00 AM local time), prohibiting all gatherings of more than ten people, and prohibiting residents from going onto rooftop platforms. Large numbers of military police are constantly patrolling Muslim residential areas.

In addition, according to news from Algiers, the atmosphere in Algiers remains tense. The city is full of large French military patrols. Police are stationed on the roofs of Muslim areas.

It is reported that the French colonial authorities are worrying about how to conduct De Gaulle's original plan to rape public opinion, a "referendum," under the wave of popular opposition to colonial rule in French-occupied Algeria.

Xinhua News Agency, December 24th: This agency's reporter reports that, under the persistent struggle of the Algerian people and the strong opposition of the French people, contradictions within the French ruling clique over the Algerian issue are becoming increasingly acute. The set of methods De Gaulle painstakingly manipulated on the Algerian issue is on the verge of bankruptcy.

In order to confuse people and extricate the French ruling clique from the ever-deepening quagmire of the colonial war in Algeria, De Gaulle, since coming to power, has successively played a set of political deception conspiracies while intensifying the military suppression of the Algerian national independence movement. He initially attempted to lure the Algerian people into accepting a disguised French colonial rule and to alleviate the pressure of the French people's opposition to the Algerian colonial war under the guise of "self-determination" and "Algeria for the Algerians." After this conspiracy failed, he then proposed a plan in November this year to establish a puppet institution, the "Public Administration Organization," in Algeria, attempting to continue to implement his conspiracy of inducing surrender and strangling the Algerian people's struggle for genuine independence.

However, De Gaulle, in promoting this set of methods, deepened the contradiction between the monopoly group he represented within the French ruling clique and the large colonialist group that advocated continuing purely naked military suppression in Algeria. De Gaulle's difficult task was not only to deceive the Algerian and French people, but also to reconcile the contradictions within the ruling clique.

After announcing that a "referendum" would be held in France and Algeria on January 8th to establish the Algerian "Public Administration Organization," De Gaulle intensified the above-mentioned two aspects of activity. On December 1st, De Gaulle met with the leaders of the five bourgeois parties that supported him in coming to power in 1958: the "Union for the New Republic," the Popular Republican Movement, the Independent Party, the Socialist Party, and the Radical Socialist Party, asking them to support him in the "referendum." De Gaulle also rushed to Algeria on December 9th to sell his "referendum" plan to the Algerian people, while appeasing French extreme colonialists, assuring them that he would not abandon Algeria and asking them to support his "referendum" plan.

The Algerian people, who have long experience in fighting the French colonists, saw through De Gaulle's conspiracy. When De Gaulle arrived in Algeria, they cast a veto on De Gaulle's plan with large-scale patriotic demonstrations demanding independence. As the French bourgeois newspaper *Le Parisien Libéré* admitted, the Algerian people's demonstrations "destroyed the structure that served as the basis for the [De Gaulle's intended] referendum." At the same time, the French colonial authorities' bloody suppression of the demonstrators further thoroughly exposed De Gaulle's colonialist face, thereby further promoting the struggle of the Algerian and French people against his "referendum" conspiracy.

However, De Gaulle still "doesn't shed tears until he sees the coffin." After being forced to return to Paris ignominiously from Algeria one day earlier than scheduled due to the Algerian people's powerful anti-French struggle, De Gaulle is currently continuing to step up the implementation of his "referendum" plan. Since December 19th, the propaganda campaign for the "referendum" under the official control of France has begun, with a new deceptive slogan: "Vote yes for peace." To this end, De Gaulle also gave a special television speech on the 20th, presenting the Algerian people with three paths to "choose their destiny," but without mentioning a word about the genuine and complete independence demanded by the Algerian people. He wanted the Algerian people to "either break with the French Republic, become a part of it, or unite with it." And according to De Gaulle's logic, "breaking up" would only cause "chaos" and is therefore a rebellious act. At that time, the French authorities further strengthened military "pacification" in Algeria, which was even more "justified."

Regardless of the outcome of the "referendum," the bankruptcy of De Gaulle's Algerian policy is becoming increasingly obvious. A person in the Algerian Provisional Government said well to a reporter from Kyodo News: "President De Gaulle, or the extreme right-wing colonialists, they are only different in tactics, but they are no different in essence." This person also said that Algeria's struggle for independence will mainly be an armed struggle in the future.

In France, the movement against De Gaulle's policies under the leadership of the French Communist Party is also becoming more widespread. The Unified Socialist Party has announced that it will oppose De Gaulle in the "referendum," and the Radical Socialist Party, which supported De Gaulle in 1958, decided on the 21st to vote against him in the "referendum." Even the pro-De Gaulle *Combat* believes that the failure of De Gaulle's current methods "will mean the end of all hope." (Attached picture)

    阿尔及利亚外交部就法占区人民示威发表声明
    阿尔及利亚人民必将重新获得自由
    法国侵阿战争连遭失败戴高乐政治诱骗政策濒于破产统治集团矛盾日益加剧
    新华社开罗26日电　阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府外交部今天就阿尔及利亚法占区城市群众示威在这里发表声明说，阿尔及利亚人民在城市中的斗争，“是我们国家反对同民族独立背道而驰的任何解决办法的有力表示”。
    声明说，“除了继续战争和在平等基础上同阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府谈判以外，没有折衷办法。以为经过七年战斗，阿尔及利亚人民会让另一个国家来决定他们的命运，那是徒然的。”
    声明指出，“阿尔及利亚人民已经迫使法帝国主义者退却许多次，北大西洋公约组织不能挽救法帝国主义的失败。”
    声明最后说，“阿尔及利亚人民相信自己，深信自己事业的正义性以及世界舆论和法国民主力量的支持，他们将重新获得自己的自由并在反对法国新殖民主义的斗争中变得愈加团结一致。”
    新华社27日讯　奥兰消息：阿尔及利亚第二大城奥兰市的爱国居民继续以他们的坚决行动反对法国殖民统治。
    昨天夜间，数以百计的穆斯林们在维克托·雨果区举行示威，并且同进行镇压的法国殖民当局军警发生冲突。群众勇敢地用瓶子和石块投掷军警。
    穆斯林开设的商店也罢市表示反对殖民统治。
    由于这个城市人民的爱国示威已经连续四天，惊惶失措的法国殖民当局采取了严格的镇压措施。当局宣布，从27日起宵禁提前两小时开始（从当地时间二十一时到次晨四时），禁止十人以上的一切集会，并禁止居民上屋顶平台。大批军警在穆斯林居住区不断巡逻。
    另外，据来自阿尔及尔的消息，阿尔及尔的空气仍然很紧张。城市中到处都是人数众多的法国军事巡逻队。警察们布防在穆斯林地区的屋顶上。
    据报道，法国殖民当局正在发愁：在阿尔及利亚法占区全民性的反对殖民统治的怒潮下，如何能进行戴高乐原先计划的强奸民意的“公民投票”。
    据新华社24日讯　本社记者报道，在阿尔及利亚人民坚持斗争和法国人民强烈反对下，法国统治集团内部在阿尔及利亚问题上的矛盾正日趋尖锐，戴高乐苦心在阿尔及利亚问题上玩弄的一套手法，正濒于破产。
    为了蛊惑人心和拔脱法国统治集团在阿尔及利亚殖民战争中愈陷愈深的泥足，戴高乐自上台以后，在加紧对阿尔及利亚民族独立运动进行军事镇压的同时，相继玩弄了一套政治欺骗阴谋。他始而企图在“自决”、“阿尔及利亚人的阿尔及利亚”这些幌子下，诱骗阿尔及利亚人民接受改头换面的法国殖民统治和缓和法国人民反对阿尔及利亚殖民战争的压力。在这一阴谋失败之后，继而又在今年11月提出在阿尔及利亚建立傀儡机构“公共行政机构”的方案，企图继续施展他的诱降和扼杀阿尔及利亚人民争取真正独立的斗争的阴谋。
    但是，戴高乐在推行这一套手法的时候，却加深了法国统治集团中他自己所代表的垄断集团，同主张在阿尔及利亚继续单纯进行赤裸裸军事镇压的大殖民主集团间的矛盾，戴高乐的困难任务是，他不仅要欺骗阿尔及利亚人民和法国人民，并且要调和统治集团内部的矛盾。
    在宣布明年1月8日在法国和阿尔及利亚就建立阿尔及利亚“公共行政机构”举行“公民投票”以后，戴高乐就加紧了上述两方面的活动。12月1日，戴高乐接见了1958年支持他上台的“保卫新共和联盟”、人民共和党、独立党、社会党和激进社会党五个资产阶级政党的领导人，要求他们在“公民投票”中支持他。戴高乐并且在12月9日赶到阿尔及利亚去，一方面向阿尔及利亚人民兜售他的“公民投票”计划，一方面安抚法国极端殖民主义分子，向他们保证不放弃阿尔及利亚和要求他们支持他的“公民投票”计划。
    有着同法国殖民者长期斗争经验的阿尔及利亚人民，识破了戴高乐的阴谋。他们在戴高乐到达阿尔及利亚的时候，以大规模要求独立的爱国示威，对戴高乐的方案投了否决票，正如法国资产阶级报纸《解放了的巴黎人报》所承认的，阿尔及利亚人民的示威“摧毁了作为（戴高乐想举行的）公民投票基础的结构”。同时法国殖民当局对示威群众的血腥镇压，也进一步彻底暴露了戴高乐的殖民者的面目，从而更加促进阿尔及利亚人民和法国人民反对他的“公民投票”阴谋的斗争。
    但是，戴高乐却仍旧“不见棺材、不掉眼泪”。在阿尔及利亚人民声势浩大的反法斗争下，被迫提前一天从阿尔及利亚灰溜溜地返回巴黎后，戴高乐目前正继续加紧推行他的“公民投票”计划。从12月19日起，在法国官方控制下的“公民投票”的宣传运动已经开始，一个新的骗人口号就是：“为了和平投赞成票吧”。为此，戴高乐在20日还特别发表电视演说，为阿尔及利亚人民提出了“选择他们的命运”的三条道路，而其中却没有一个字谈到阿尔及利亚人民坚持要求的真正和完全的独立。他要阿尔及利亚人民“要末同法兰西共和国决裂，要末成为它的一部分，要末同它联合”。而按照戴高乐的逻辑，“决裂”是只会引起“混乱”因而也是大逆不道的行为。到那时，法国当局进一步加强在阿尔及利亚的军事“绥靖”，倒是更加“师出有名”了。
    不管“公民投票”的结果如何，戴高乐的阿尔及利亚政策的破产已经日趋明显了。阿尔及利亚临时政府人士对共同社记者的一篇谈话说得好：“戴高乐总统也好，极右派的殖民者也好，他们只是策略上的不同，在本质上是没有两样的”。这个人士还说，阿尔及利亚争取独立的斗争今后主要还是武装斗争。
    在法国国内，法国共产党领导下的反对戴高乐政策的运动也越来越广泛。统一社会党已经宣布要在“公民投票”中反对戴高乐，在1958年支持戴高乐的激进社会党21日已经决定在“公民投票”中投反对票。甚至连亲戴高乐的《战斗报》也认为，戴高乐目前这套手法的失败“将意味着一切希望的终结”。（附图片）
