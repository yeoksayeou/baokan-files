Thoroughly and Meticulously Investigate the Needs of the Masses; Tirelessly Solve Minor Problems
Liangjiadian Supply and Marketing Cooperative Helps Members Live Well Through the Winter

    (Based on a report from the Lüda Daily) The Liangjiadian Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Jin County, Lüda City, an advanced unit, under the leadership of the Commune Party Committee, has been deeply involved with the masses, visiting households to inquire about their well-being and serving the masses practically and meticulously, which has been warmly welcomed by the masses.

    Since the autumn, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative, in accordance with the Commune Party Committee's directive to focus on the people's livelihoods, has mobilized all employees to go deep into the masses, eating, living, working, and discussing matters with them to fully understand their needs. Wang Wenbin, the Party Branch Secretary, along with the staff of the Tuchengzi Brigade and the branch store, conducted a family economic life survey of 126 households, comprising 702 members, in the Fourth Team. They also convened symposiums with representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants to comprehensively understand the needs of the masses. Through the survey, they gained a clear understanding, and those who previously thought that the needs of the masses were too complex to understand have now gained confidence and are full of energy. They reported to the Commune Party Committee. After a comprehensive study, the Party Committee considered the survey to be relatively detailed and comprehensive, with universal significance, and decided that in addition to promptly delivering goods to the members according to the degree of urgency, various service organizations should be established throughout the commune to comprehensively arrange the winter life of the masses.

    Based on the Party Committee's decision, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative, in response to the needs of the masses, extensively launched a "Hundred Services" campaign. They formed over 130 service groups covering more than ten service projects, including house repair, heating equipment, sewing, washing and mending, weaving and mending mats, processing and repairing, and others, to arrange the winter life of the masses. To facilitate the masses, each service group collected old clothes, old shoes and hats, old stoves, and old stovepipes from the members, processed and modified them, and then delivered them to the members, which the masses were very satisfied with.

    At the same time, they also visited each household to inquire about their well-being and tirelessly solve the small problems in the lives of the masses. Wang Shengyu, a member of the Tuchengzi Brigade, had eleven family members, and he could not make cotton clothes in time. Yang Fushan, the director of the branch store, learned of this situation and told him to take his clothes to the service group to be washed and disassembled. In just a few days, the service group had refurbished the dozen or so old clothes he had taken in, making them look as good as new. One member didn't have wula (Manchu boots), so the Supply and Marketing Cooperative cadres asked him if he had old wula. He said he had three pairs, so the Supply and Marketing Cooperative modified them into a good pair of wula for him. Zhang Chengmei, a salesperson at the branch store, found some empty jars and pots in the home of a member and asked why they weren't using them. The member said they were cracked. Zhang Chengmei felt that it was the right time to pickle vegetables and sauerkraut, and that sawing up these jars and pots could solve a big problem. He immediately found a tool for sawing jars and pots and sawed them for the members. He saw that the windowpanes of a member's house were broken, so he used broken glass to patch them up.

    The employees of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative firmly established the mass viewpoint, treating the suffering of the masses as their own. They gave appropriate care to special households such as revolutionary martyrs' families, disabled people, families with large populations, little labor, and financial difficulties, as well as single men, according to their individual needs. Liu Rencai, a poor peasant in the Tuchengzi Brigade, fell ill, and his mother, who was blind, had difficulty taking care of him. Mao Shuzhen, a salesperson at the branch store, discovered this and not only promptly invited a doctor but also personally boiled medicine and water. Under her patient care, Liu Rencai's condition quickly improved.

    Currently, this Supply and Marketing Cooperative has repaired 521 houses for its members, installed and repaired more than 600 stoves, built kang (heated brick bed) flues and manufactured 380 meters of earthen stovepipes, repaired more than 300 sections of stovepipes, woven and repaired more than 800 mats, dismantled, washed, repaired, and made more than 30,000 pieces of various clothes, shoes, hats, and cotton quilts, properly arranging the winter life of the masses.

    深入细致地调查群众需要　不厌其烦地解决细小问题
    亮甲店供销社挨户帮助社员过好冬季生活
    本报讯　据旅大日报消息：旅大市先进单位、金县亮甲店供销社在公社党委的领导下，深入群众挨家逐户问冷暖，扎实细致地为群众生活服务，受到群众的热烈欢迎。
    这个供销社入秋以来，即根据公社党委大抓生活的指示精神，发动全体职工深入群众，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，全面了解群众需要。党支部书记王文斌到土城子大队和分销店职工一起，对第四小队一百二十六户，七百零二名社员进行了家庭经济生活调查，并召开了贫农下中农代表座谈会，全面了解群众的需要。通过调查，他们心中有了数，原来认为群众需要太复杂而不易了解的人，现在也增强了信心，鼓足了干劲。他们向公社党委作了汇报。党委全面研究以后，认为这个调查比较细致全面，具有普遍意义，于是决定除分别轻重缓急把商品及时送到社员手中外，还要在全公社范围内建立各种服务组织，全面安排好群众冬季生活。
    供销社根据党委的决定，针对群众的需要，广泛开展“百项服务”运动。他们组成了房屋修建、取暖设备、缝纫、洗补、编补席子、加工修理等十余种服务项目的一百三十多个服务组，为群众安排冬季生活。为了方便群众，各服务组都把社员的旧衣服、旧鞋帽、旧炉子、旧烟筒等收上来，加工改制后再送到社员手中，群众十分满意。
    与此同时，他们还挨家逐户问寒问暖，不厌其烦地具体解决群众生活中的细小问题。土城子大队社员王生玉家中十一口人，棉衣一时做不上，分销店主任杨福善了解到这一情况后，就告诉他把衣服拿到服务组去拆洗，过了不几天，拿出去的十几件旧衣服，服务组给整旧如新了。有个社员没有靰鞡，供销社干部就问他有没有旧靰鞡，他说有三双，供销社就给他改制成了一双好靰鞡。分销店营业员张成美在社员家中发现有些缸和坛子闲着不用，他就打听社员为什么不用，社员说裂口了。张成美觉得现在正是渍菜、腌菜的时候，要把这些缸坛锯起来，能解决很大问题。他就立即设法找到锯缸的工具，为社员锯缸坛。他看到社员家的门窗玻璃碎了，就利用碎玻璃给镶接起来。
    这个供销社的职工牢固地树立起群众观点，把群众的疾苦当作自己的疾苦。他们对烈军属，残废人和人口多、劳动力少、生活有困难以及单身汉等特殊户，因人制宜地给予了适当照顾。土城子大队贫农刘仁财生了病，母亲双目失明难以照顾，分销店营业员毛淑贞发现后，不仅及时给请来了大夫，还亲自给煎药烧水。在她的耐心护理下，刘仁财的病情很快就好转了。
    目前，这个供销社已为社员修理房屋五百二十一间，盘炉子和修理炉子六百多个，盘炕道和制造土烟筒三百八十米，修理烟筒三百多节，编补席子八百多张，拆洗修补和制作各种衣服、鞋帽、棉被等三万多件，把群众的越冬生活安排得妥妥贴贴。
