    Comprehensively Arrange Teaching Work
    Qiao Huairen
    The central task of a school is teaching. All other work revolves around teaching. This is a very obvious principle.
    However, due to different approaches, two completely different results can be produced. Our schools are to cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and culture, and to develop them comprehensively in terms of moral, intellectual, and physical education. Due to the resolute implementation of the Party's education policy, and because education serves proletarian politics, today's school work is far from comparable to the past. School and the overall revolutionary situation are closely linked. School work is not isolated, and it has close ties with industry, agriculture, and other work. This presents a difficult problem for school work: how to comprehensively arrange things to promote teaching in multiple ways? One approach is to comprehensively arrange teaching work, without wasting any time, but other aspects are not well arranged; the other approach is to arrange not only the eight hours of teaching, but also the eight hours of after-school activities and ensure adequate sleep time. Is the former approach good? It is good, but not enough. Because school work is a whole, if only teaching work is arranged and other work is not, there is a risk of being squeezed out; and squeezing out time outside of teaching will also have a great impact on teaching. Take students' lives, for example, which seems like a small matter, but if not arranged well, it will hinder teaching. For example, to enable students to learn well, on the one hand, they must be educated to carry forward the spirit of hard study, and on the other hand, they must be concerned about their eating, living, and rest, so that students can always maintain sufficient energy. Poor eating and insufficient sleep will also limit learning. Poor student health cannot be considered a comprehensive improvement in teaching quality. Today, the news about the Huazhong Institute of Technology and the Dalian Institute of Technology in this newspaper provides good examples in this regard. These two schools have directly promoted the improvement of teaching quality by paying attention to arranging students' lives.
    Furthermore, labor, although closely integrated with teaching, must also be integrated appropriately. Too little or too much labor will not achieve the goal of improving teaching quality. What is considered appropriate? It cannot be generalized. It must be determined based on the nature of the school, the age of the students, and the specific circumstances of whether the school is in a rural or urban area. To closely integrate teaching with production is not just a matter of time arrangement, but also requires organizing diverse forms of labor according to different situations. Like the Department of Biology of Nanjing Normal College and the Hebei Academy of Fine Arts as reported in today's newspaper, students can be organized to participate in on-campus labor, or off-campus labor; there is both professional labor and general labor; there is both long-term labor and short-term labor. Without analyzing specific situations, and organizing students to participate in various forms of labor in a way that suits the time, place, and people, grasping everything at once, students cannot be better invested in the crucible of labor training, nor can they acquire richer knowledge; at the same time, labor and rest cannot be better combined.
    In this way, grasping life and grasping labor are actually for the sake of teaching, and cannot be taken lightly. Other aspects, such as dealing with social activities, must also be comprehensively arranged. Only by comprehensively arranging all the work of the school, especially in life and labor, can we truly achieve promoting teaching in multiple ways.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said in "Methods of Work of Party Committees": "To play the piano well, all ten fingers must move; some fingers moving while others are still will not do. But if all ten fingers move at once, there will be no melody. To produce good music, the movement of the ten fingers must be rhythmic and coordinated. The Party Committee must grasp the central work, and at the same time, carry out other aspects of work around the central work." The same is true for running education. The focus of school work is teaching; but only seeing teaching and ignoring other aspects of work, while seemingly grasping teaching, will not actually grasp it well. Comrades engaged in education must also learn this "playing the piano" method of work to make our schools better and better!

    全面安排教学工作
    乔怀仁
    学校的中心工作是教学。其他工作都是围绕教学进行的。这是十分明显的道理。
    但是，由于做法不同，可以产生两种完全不同的结果。我们的学校，是要培养有社会主义觉悟有文化的劳动者，要在德育、智育、体育三方面得到全面的发展。由于坚决贯彻党的教育方针，由于教育为无产阶级政治服务，现在的学校工作和过去远远不能相比。学校和整个革命形势息息相通。学校工作不是孤立的，和工农业以及其他工作，有密切的联系。这就给学校工作提出了一个难题：怎样全面安排，才能做到多方面促进教学呢？一种是把教学工作全面安排了，一点时间也不浪费，其他方面都没有很好安排；另一种是既安排了教学的八小时，也安排了课余的八小时和保证睡眠时间。前一种做法好不好呢？好，但是不够。因为学校工作是一个整体，如果只安排了教学工作，其他工作没有安排，就有被挤掉的危险；而挤掉了教学以外的时间，对教学也有很大的影响。就拿学生的生活来说吧，看来是件小事，但安排得不好，就会妨碍教学。比如说，要使学生学得好，一方面要教育他们发扬刻苦读书的精神，另一方面还要关心他们的吃、住和休息的问题，使学生经常保持充沛的精力。吃不好睡不足，学习也会受到限制。学生体质不好，也就不能算作全面提高教学质量。今天，本报刊登的华中工学院和大连工学院的新闻中，就有这方面的好例子。这两个学校，由于注意安排学生生活，直接促进了教学质量的提高。
    再如劳动，虽然要和教学密切结合，但是，结合也必须恰当。劳动过少或者过多都达不到提高教学质量目的。怎么样才算恰当？不能一概而论。要根据学校的性质、学生的年龄，以及学校是在农村或在城市等等具体情况来确定。要使教学紧密结合生产，不光是时间的安排问题，还必须根据不同情况，组织多种多样的劳动。像今天本报发表的南京师范学院生物系和河北美术学院那样，可组织学生参加校内劳动，也可参加校外劳动；既有专业性劳动，又有一般性劳动；既有长期劳动，也有短期劳动。不分析具体情况，因时因地因人制宜地组织学生参加多种劳动，眉毛胡子一把抓，就不能使学生更好地投入劳动锻炼的熔炉中去，就不能使学生获得更丰富的知识；同时，也不能使劳和逸更好地结合起来。
    这样说来，抓生活，抓劳动，实际上也就是为了教学，不可等闲视之。其他如对待社会活动等，也要全面地安排。只有全面安排了学校的一切工作，其中特别是生活、劳动等方面，才能真正做到多方面促进教学。
    毛泽东同志在《党委会的工作方法》一文中说：“弹钢琴要十个指头都动作，不能有的动，有的不动。但是，十个指头同时都按下去，那也不成调子。要产生好的音乐，十个指头的动作要有节奏，要互相配合。党委要抓紧中心工作，又要围绕中心工作而同时开展其他方面的工作。”办教育也是如此。学校工作的重点，是教学；但是光看到教学，忽视了其他方面的工作，看起来是抓了教学，实际上也抓不好。从事教育工作的同志，也必须学会这种“弹钢琴”的工作方法，把我们的学校越办越好！
