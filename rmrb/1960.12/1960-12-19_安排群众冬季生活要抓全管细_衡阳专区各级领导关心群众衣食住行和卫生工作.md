Arrangements for winter life for the masses must be grasped comprehensively and meticulously.
Hengyang Prefecture leaders at all levels care about the people's food, clothing, housing, transportation, and sanitation.
(Our newspaper Changsha, December 18th dispatch) The Party committees at all levels in Hengyang Prefecture, Hunan Province, have adopted forceful measures to make proper and comprehensive arrangements for the winter lives of the masses, so that the broad masses of commune members can eat well, dress warmly, feel comfortable, and actively engage in winter production.
Hengyang Prefecture has suffered from severe droughts for two consecutive years, resulting in certain losses in production. Under the leadership of the Prefectural Committee, Party organizations at all levels throughout the region, with secretaries taking the lead, the entire Party mobilized, and dedicated personnel responsible, are making arrangements for the lives of urban and rural people. In arranging life, all localities have implemented the principle of taking grain as the center, and taking the good management of canteens as the focus of arranging the winter life of the masses. Under the leadership of the Party, democratic management organizations for canteens have been established, the dominance of poor and lower-middle peasants has been established, and good teams of administrators, accountants, and cooks have been equipped. In the previous stage, all canteens used mass self-education methods such as recollection and comparison, and detailed accounting to conduct in-depth and meticulous education on diligence and thrift among commune members, encouraging the masses to strengthen their determination, overcome difficulties, improve production, and arrange their lives well. On this basis, the masses were mobilized to formulate specific plans for arranging life, strengthen democratic management, and implement planned grain use. In order to run the canteens well, it is necessary to "bring politics to the canteen, and cadres to the kitchen." Ning Sheng, the first secretary of the Hengyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, went deep into the Garden Canteen of the Jibing Brigade of the Zhangmu Commune in Hengyang to mobilize commune members to plant vegetables on a large scale. Li Zisheng, the first secretary of the Changning County Party Committee, and Wu Hancheng, the secretary, went deep into the Songlin No. 1 and No. 2 canteens of the Longmen Brigade of the Yintian Commune to help the canteens select selfless, active poor and lower-middle peasants to form core leading groups, educate the canteen staff to work with peace of mind, strengthen unity and mutual assistance; at the same time, democratically formulate management systems and establish canteen housekeeping, and quickly run the canteens well.
Comprehensive grasping and meticulous management are a prominent feature of Hengyang Prefecture's arrangements for the winter lives of the masses. In addition to eating, leaders at all levels have made comprehensive arrangements for clothing, housing, heating, travel, and disease prevention. Many units organized cadres to go down to inspect and understand, and specifically solve problems. In order to rush out cotton clothes and quilts in a timely manner, many places concentrated tailors and cotton fluffing workers to give priority to sewing. The Shiba Brigade of the Baishui Commune in Qiyang has organized sixteen tailors and fluffers to rush out eighty-two cotton clothes and thirty-four cotton quilts. Various localities have also paid special attention to taking care of single men during the winter. The Yuexing Brigade of the Qulan Commune in Hengyang organized twenty-five old women and old men to form a living service group, specializing in making grass sandals and mending clothes and washing clothes for single men. In terms of housing, repairs have been made to houses that are drafty and leaking, and more than 210,000 of the more than 350,000 houses that need to be repaired in the entire region have been repaired. Arrangements have also been made for firewood and coal for heating according to historical habits and the principle of local materials, and there are 20,000 laborers in Lingling County who go up the mountain to collect firewood every day, and the daily firewood collection can reach 4 million catties. In order to save coal and firewood, many plum blossom stoves have been rebuilt and one stove with three pots has been implemented in various parts of the region. Many communes have also rushed to make a large number of bamboo hats, raincoats, and wooden clogs and other rain gear, so that commune members are neither blocked nor frozen when they go to work.
In arranging winter life, various localities have particularly emphasized the combination of work and rest. Most communes have implemented a regular holiday system, and the daily working hours have been appropriately reduced; and the masses have been mobilized to carry out winter sanitation and do a good job in disease prevention. The Nanyue Commune in Hengshan focuses on the three links of food, vegetables, and water, taking the canteen as the center, to ensure that commune members eat warm, full, hygienic, and nutritious food. Many canteens have also established health systems and regularly take preventive medicines, effectively preventing diseases.
The more the Party cares about the lives of the masses, the higher the enthusiasm of the masses for production. Now, the broad masses of commune members are strengthening the cultivation and management of more than 6.16 million mu of winter crops and carrying out winter fertilizer accumulation.

    安排群众冬季生活要抓全管细
    衡阳专区各级领导关心群众衣食住行和卫生工作
    本报长沙18日电　湖南省衡阳专区各级党委采取有力措施，对群众冬季生活，作出妥善全面的安排，使广大社员吃好穿暖，精神舒畅，积极投入冬季生产。
    衡阳专区连续两年遭受严重的旱灾，生产上受到了一定的损失。在地委领导下，全区各级党组织都是书记挂帅、全党动手、专人负责安排城乡人民的生活。在安排生活中，各地都贯彻了以粮食为中心的原则，把办好食堂作为安排群众过冬生活的重点。在党的领导下，建立食堂的民主管理机构，树立了贫农下中农的优势，配备好管理员、会计员和炊事员的班子。各个食堂在前一阶段都运用回忆对比、算细账等群众自我教育的方法，向社员进行了深入细致的勤俭过日子的教育，鼓舞了群众发愤图强、克服困难、搞好生产、安排好生活的意志和信心。在这个基础上发动群众订出安排生活的具体规划，加强民主管理，实行计划用粮。为了办好食堂，做到“政治到食堂，干部下伙房”。中共衡阳地委第一书记宁生同志深入衡阳樟木公社集兵大队花园食堂，发动社员大种蔬菜。常宁县委第一书记李子生、书记伍汉成深入荫田公社龙门大队松林一、二食堂，帮助食堂选出大公无私、积极工作的贫雇农和下中农成立核心领导小组，教育食堂的工作人员安心工作，加强团结互助；同时又民主制订管理制度，建立食堂小家务，很快办好了食堂。
    抓得全，管得细是衡阳专区安排群众过冬生活的一个显著特点。除吃饭外，对穿衣、住房、取暖、行路和防病等，各级领导都作了全面安排。许多单位组织干部下去检查了解，具体解决问题。为了及时赶制出棉衣棉被，许多地方把裁缝和弹花工人集中起来优先缝制。祁阳白水公社石坝大队组织十六个裁缝和弹匠已经赶制出八十二件棉衣、三十四床棉被。各地对单身汉过冬也特别注意照顾。衡阳曲蓝公社月形大队组织二十五个老婆婆和老公公成立一个生活服务组，专门打草编草鞋，为单身汉缝补衣服和洗衣浆衫。住的方面，对透风漏雨的房屋进行了检修，全区需整修的三十五万多间房子，现已整修好二十一万多间。取暖用的柴和煤，各地也按照历史习惯和就地取材的原则进行了安排，零陵县每天上山打柴的劳力达二万人，每日打柴可达四百万斤。为节约用煤用柴，全区各地改建了许多梅花灶和实行一灶三锅。许多公社还赶制大批斗笠蓑衣和木屐等雨具，使社员出工既不受阻又不受冻。
    各地在安排冬季生活中，特别强调劳逸结合。大多数公社已经实行定期放假制度，每日劳动时间适当减少；并发动群众大搞冬季卫生，作好防病工作。衡山南岳公社以食堂为中心，抓住饭、菜、水三个环节，保证社员吃暖吃饱吃得卫生和有营养。许多食堂还建立了卫生制度，定期服用预防药，有效地防止了疾病。
    党对群众的生活愈是关心，群众生产积极性也愈高。现在，广大社员正对六百一十六万多亩冬季作物加强培育管理，开展冬季积肥。（附图片）
