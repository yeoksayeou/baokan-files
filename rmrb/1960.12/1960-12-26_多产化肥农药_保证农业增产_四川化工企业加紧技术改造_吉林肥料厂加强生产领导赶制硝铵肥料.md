Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 24th - Sichuan Province's more than 200 county-level and above chemical enterprises and more than 6,300 district and commune-level fertilizer and pesticide plants are systematically and gradually carrying out technical transformations in order to produce more and better chemical fertilizers and pesticides to support agricultural production.

For county-level and above chemical plants, various regions have appropriately supplemented some equipment to gradually develop them in the direction of producing high-efficiency varieties. The Hongguang Chemical Plant in Nanchong County, adapting to local conditions and using local materials, manufactured indigenous equipment and carried out technical transformations. It has developed from producing a single product to being able to produce acid, alkali, and other twelve major products in batches. Furthermore, through comprehensive utilization, it has manufactured thirty-eight kinds of chemical raw materials such as acetic acid and magnesium chloride. The Shangyou Fertilizer Plant used waste and old materials purchased by the supply and marketing cooperative to make 122 pieces of large and small tools such as triacid pots and cold air pipes, which continuously increased output and product variety. It can now produce twenty-five kinds of high-efficiency fertilizers and pesticides such as ammonium chloride and potassium nitrate. These more than 200 chemical plants have fixed workers for year-round production and provide technical guidance to the fertilizer and pesticide production of various counties.

The province's existing more than 6,300 district and commune-level fertilizer plants are continuing to deepen the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and are carrying out semi-mechanization in processes such as crushing, grinding, screening, transportation, loading, and unloading. After the district and commune-level fertilizer plants in the Nanchong area carried out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, more than half have basically achieved semi-mechanization or indigenous automation of fertilizer and pesticide production. Labor productivity has increased several times, saving more than 13,000 people to support agriculture. In the technical innovation movement, the workers of the Sanyi Chemical Plant in Jinxi District, Peng'an County, changed manual crushing to jaw-plate hammer crushing, changed grinding with one person and one mortar to one person stepping on ten mortars, changed manual mixing to semi-mechanized mixing, and changed manual carrying to rail transportation, basically realizing a complete semi-mechanized production line from raw materials to finished products. As a result, the entire plant was reduced from 122 people to 73 people, and also overfulfilled the production plan.

This newspaper reports that the staff and workers of the Fertilizer Plant of Jilin Chemical Industry Company are actively increasing the production of ammonium nitrate fertilizer for next year's agricultural production. In early December, the output of synthetic ammonia increased by 11.8% compared with late November, and the output of ammonium nitrate increased by 12.5%.

In order to strengthen leadership over production, the plant's Party committee transferred four Party committee members to key workshops to work and discuss with the workers, and promptly solved problems. In response to the situation of fewer old workers and more new workers on the front line of production, the entire plant transferred more than 100 cadres to the workshops, and many old workers returned to their production posts. The staff and workers of each workshop consciously combined doing a good job in production with supporting agriculture. In the cold season, steam consumption increased greatly. In order to ensure stable and high production throughout the plant, the workers in the water and motor workshop put forward the slogan "Saving one ton of steam is equivalent to increasing the production of one ton of synthetic ammonia," actively doing a good job in steam conservation and water recovery, which strongly guaranteed the increase in production. At the same time, the entire plant vigorously grasped equipment maintenance and repair, and strengthened weak links.

    多产化肥农药　保证农业增产
    四川化工企业加紧技术改造
    吉林肥料厂加强生产领导赶制硝铵肥料
    新华社成都24日电　四川省二百多个县属以上的化工企业和六千三百多个区、公社属化肥、农药厂，正在有计划地逐步进行技术改造，以便生产出更多更好的化肥、农药，支援农业生产。
    对于县属以上的化工厂，各地适当充实了部分设备，使它们逐步向生产高效品种的方向发展。南充县红光化工厂因地制宜，就地取材，制造土简设备，进行技术改造，已由生产单一的产品发展到能成批生产酸、碱等十二种主要产品，并且通过综合利用，制造出醋酸、氯化镁等三十八种化工原料。上游化肥厂利用供销社收购的废旧材料，制成三酸锅、冷气管等大小工具一百二十二件，使产量和产品品种都不断增加，现在已能生产氯化铵、硝酸钾等二十五种高效化肥、农药。这二百多个化工厂都固定了工人，进行常年生产，并在技术上指导各县的化肥、农药生产。
    全省现有的六千三百多个区、社属化肥厂，正在继续深入地开展技术革新和技术革命运动，在破碎、碾磨、筛分、运输、装卸等工序大搞半机械化。南充地区各区、社属化肥厂开展技术革新和技术革命运动后，有一半以上已基本实现了化肥、农药生产半机械化或土联动化，劳动生产率成倍提高，节约出一万三千多人支援了农业。蓬安县金溪区三一化工厂工人在技术革新运动中，改手工粉碎为夹板锤粉碎，改磨细一人一碓为一人脚踏十碓，改人工搅拌为半机械化拌料，改人力挑运为轨道运输，基本上实现了从原料到成品一条龙半机械化生产。因此，全厂由一百二十二人减少为七十三人，还超额完成了生产计划。
    本报讯　吉林化学工业公司肥料厂职工为明年农业生产积极增产硝铵肥料。12月上旬合成氨的产量就比11月下旬增长11.8％，硝铵产量增长12.5％。
    厂党委为了加强对生产的领导，抽了四名党委委员深入到重点车间，和工人同劳动、同商量，发现问题及时解决。针对生产第一线老工人少、新工人多的情况，全厂下放了一百多名干部到车间，很多老工人重新回到生产岗位。各车间职工都自觉地把搞好生产和支援农业结合起来。在严寒的季节里，蒸汽用量增加很多。为保证全厂稳定高产，水汽车间工人提出“节约一吨蒸汽，就是增产一吨合成氨”的口号，积极做好保汽回水工作，有力地保证了生产增长。同时，全厂狠抓设备维护和检修工作，并加强了薄弱环节。
