    目前加紧用大量武器装备蒋介石军队
    新华社10日讯　据台湾报纸消息，美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团团长达伦最近宣布，自1951年5月美军顾问团成立到今年11月，美国给予蒋介石集团的“军事援助”总额约达二十亿美元。达伦在11月17日还叫嚣说，美国军事顾问正在对蒋介石军队施行“适应原子战争情况的训练”。他说，美国已经把较新的大炮、坦克、能够携带响尾蛇导弹的各型新式飞机、“奈克—赫尔克里士”导弹等交给蒋军。今后还要替蒋军“不断更新武器与装备”。
    台湾报纸说，美国侵略者在12月6日又把一批F—104型喷气战斗机运到台湾，交给蒋介石空军编入战斗序列，担任所谓“台湾海峡上空的巡逻任务”。美帝国主义依照所谓“共同安全计划”，最近还把一艘排水量八千吨的船坞登陆舰在美国加利福尼亚州长滩港交给蒋介石集团。
