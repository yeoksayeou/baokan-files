Xinhua News Agency, Washington, December 13th: U.S. President-elect Kennedy announced in Palm Beach, Florida, on December 12th the appointment of Dean Rusk, Chairman of the Rockefeller Monopoly Consortium's Foundation, as the next U.S. Secretary of State.

He also announced the appointment of Stevenson, a Democrat who had twice failed in his presidential campaigns, as the Permanent Representative to the United Nations, and Congressman Bowles as Undersecretary of State.

When announcing Rusk's appointment, Kennedy indicated that the new Democratic government would continue to implement the current Republican government's basic policies, noting that Rusk "has consistently demonstrated a deep concern for a bipartisan approach to foreign policy."

Kennedy then emphasized that the United States should intensify its global aggressive policies, particularly its aggressive policies toward the world's underdeveloped regions. He specifically mentioned Rusk's "experience" in his work at the Rockefeller Foundation, where he "came into contact with the situation in various parts of the world, especially the Americas, Latin America, Asia, and Africa." Kennedy said that how to deal with the surging national independence movements in underdeveloped regions is "a common and enormous challenge facing the United States in its foreign policy in the 1960s."

At the same time, Kennedy pointed out that the United States should strengthen its relations with Western European allies.

In accepting Kennedy's appointment, Rusk said that the United States "is at a time of rapid and revolutionary change," and he clamored that the United States must use its "enormous capacity for action" to "play a major role in determining the situation."

The Rockefeller Foundation is an institution of the Rockefeller, one of the largest monopoly capital groups in the United States. Its role and purpose are to assist in promoting the aggressive policies of U.S. imperialism, especially the Rockefeller Consortium, in various regions of the world. During Rusk's tenure as chairman of the foundation, the foundation recruited many American bourgeois politicians and strategists to conduct extensive discussions on "the challenges that the United States may face in the next ten years" and put forward a series of "research reports" on U.S. domestic and foreign policies. In the military policy report, it狂热狂热 fervently advocated that the United States should greatly increase military spending to carry out the nuclear arms race, and while actively preparing for a full-scale war, it should intensify preparations for conducting local wars. In the foreign policy report, it insisted that the United States must do its utmost to pursue a policy of external aggression and expansion in order to establish a "new world order."

Rusk has been the chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation since 1952. Prior to that, he served as Assistant Secretary of State and Deputy Undersecretary of State in the Democratic Truman administration from 1947 to 1952. Agence France-Presse reported that during his tenure as Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, he "played a major role" in the U.S. launching the Korean War and forcibly occupying China's territory of Taiwan.

    肯尼迪任命腊斯克为国务卿
    史蒂文森鲍尔斯分任驻联合国代表和副国务卿
    腊斯克叫嚷美国要在“决定局势中起重大作用”
    新华社13日讯　华盛顿消息：美国当选总统肯尼迪12日在佛罗里达州棕榈海滩城，宣布任命洛克菲勒垄断财团的基金会主席迪安·腊斯克为下届美国政府的国务卿。
    他同时还宣布任命民主党内曾经两度竞选总统失败的史蒂文森为驻联合国常任代表，并任命众议员鲍尔斯为副国务卿。
    肯尼迪在宣布对腊斯克的任命时表明，民主党新政府要继续执行目前共和党政府的基本政策，他指出，腊斯克“一直表现了深深关心对外交政策采取两党一致的态度”。
    肯尼迪接着强调美国要加紧推行它的全球性的侵略政策，特别是对世界不发达地区的侵略政策。他特别提到腊斯克在洛克菲勒基金会的工作中“接触到世界各地的情况，特别是美洲、拉丁美洲、亚洲和非洲”等地情况的“体验”。肯尼迪说，如何对付不发达地区声势澎湃的民族独立运动是“美国在六十年代在外交政策方面面对的、共同的、巨大的挑战”。
    同时，肯尼迪指出，美国要加强同西欧盟国的关系。
    腊斯克在接受肯尼迪的任命时说，美国“正处在（世界）发生迅速的、革命性变化的时期”，他叫嚷美国必须用它“巨大的行动能力”在“决定局势方面起重大作用”。
    洛克菲勒基金会是美国最大的垄断资本集团之一洛克菲勒的一个机构，它的作用和宗旨是在世界各地区协助推行美帝国主义、特别是洛克菲勒财团的侵略政策。在腊斯克担任这个基金会的主席期间，这个基金会曾经网罗许多美国资产阶级政客和谋士，对“今后十年内美国可能面临的挑衅”进行了广泛讨论，就美国内外政策提出了一系列“研究报告”。在军事政策报告里，狂热鼓吹美国要大量增加军费来进行核军备竞赛，在积极准备全面战争的同时，要加紧准备进行局部战争。在对外政策报告里，坚持美国必须竭力推行向外侵略扩张政策，来建立“世界新秩序”。
    腊斯克从1952年来一直是洛克菲勒基金会主席。在这以前，他从1947年到1952年在民主党杜鲁门政府里担任助理国务卿、副国务卿帮办等职。法新社消息指出，在他担任远东事务助理国务卿时期，他曾在美国发动侵略朝鲜战争和武力霸占中国领土台湾中“起了重大作用”。
