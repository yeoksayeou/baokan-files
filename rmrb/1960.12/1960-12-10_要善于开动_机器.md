Be Good at Starting the “Machine”
　　Qiao Huairen

　　To do a good job in the production team, like the Liu Rencao team: “All forty-seven laborers in the team work harmoniously like a huge machine, and the song of active collaboration resounds everywhere.” This is indeed not an easy task. However, as long as we work hard, it can be done. Liu Rencao is an example.

　　The starting of the machine lies in people. The reason why this machine can emit harmonious songs is because the driver of the machine—Liu Rencao—is good at starting his own thinking machine. Whether Liu Rencao is doing ideological work or organizational work, he repeatedly thinks, then comes up with ideas, formulates methods, puts them into practice, and achieves victory. When he heard the new member Liu Renzhuo say that he had no difficulties, he repeatedly thought and repeatedly questioned him, finally clarifying Liu Renzhuo's ideological concerns. Using this as an example, he generalized and gradually clarified the ideological situation and expertise of the new members. On this basis, Liu Rencao made proper arrangements for their work, mobilizing everyone's enthusiasm for production.

　　Comrade Mao Zedong greatly advocated this spirit of being good at starting the thinking machine long ago. In his speech "Learning and the Current Situation," he said: "The so-called starting the machine means being good at using the thinking organs. Some people, although they have no burdens on their backs and have the advantage of contacting the masses, are not good at thinking, unwilling to use their brains to think hard, and as a result, they still cannot accomplish anything. Still others, because they have burdens on their backs, are unwilling to use their brains, and their intelligence is compressed by the burdens." Here, Comrade Mao Zedong not only spoke of the important significance of "thinking hard," but also told us the method of using the thinking organs. What method? There are two: one is to put down the burden, and the other is to contact the masses. In fact, these two are the same meaning; only by putting down the burden can we better contact the masses. Burdens are meant to weigh people down. If you carry it on your back and don't let go, it is difficult to start the thinking organ machine; even if it is started, it is not flexible. Only by putting down this burden can we advance lightly, broaden our minds, and comprehensively consider problems.

　　However, to consider problems comprehensively, an individual still has great limitations and must "have the advantage of contacting the masses." Because the hard thinking we advocate is fundamentally different from wild thinking, let alone fantasy divorced from reality. It must be based on facts, through the analysis and generalization of facts, and then draw conclusions to guide practice. How to understand reality? In addition to frequently contacting reality oneself, it is also necessary to maintain frequent contact with the masses. Practice comes from the masses. If a cadre does not "have the advantage of contacting the masses" and is completely isolated from reality, even if you think hard for a long time, it is like building a cart behind closed doors and will not help. However, if you only "have the advantage of contacting the masses" and collect a large amount of material from the masses without thinking or analyzing, you can at most only discover problems and raise problems, but you cannot solve them. In this way, the power of contacting the masses cannot be fully utilized. Liu Rencao's skillful arrangement of labor power can illustrate this point. After the five-person "think tank" reported to him the problem of the unconcentrated arrangement of labor power, he started the thinking machine and found a method of "grasping the first line within the first line." Not only that, when Liu Rencao discovered problems through production, he continued to start the thinking machine, "still writing articles in his heart," striving to solve problems more deeply and more extensively. For example, when he discovered loopholes in the use of labor power, he thought that the masses would also discover them. When he contacted the masses, sure enough, the masses discovered more than he did alone. Liu Rencao's style of hard thinking has a close relationship with contacting the masses, so it is in line with objective reality and can enable the complex machine to run at full capacity and keep turning.

　　At present, many cadres are concentrated on the front line of agricultural production. They have full enthusiasm for running agriculture in a big way and running grain in a big way. As long as they act in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's teaching of hard thinking and are good at following the mass line, they will surely be able to play a greater role.

    要善于开动“机器”
    乔怀仁
    要把生产小队工作做好，像刘仁草小队那样：“全队四十七个劳动力，像一架庞大的机器一样，和谐地工作着，处处响起主动协作的歌声。”这的确不是一件容易的事。但是，只要努力去做，还是可以做到的。刘仁草就是一个范例。
    机器的开动，在于人。这架机器所以能发出和谐的歌声，是由于机器的驾驶者——刘仁草，善于开动自己的思想机器。刘仁草不论在做思想工作或组织工作时，都要反复思考，然后拿出主意，订出办法，付诸实施，取得胜利。当他听到新社员刘仁灼说自己没有什么困难时，他反复思考，一再追问，终于弄清了刘仁灼的思想顾虑。并以此为例，推而广之，逐个摸清了新社员的思想情况和特长。在此基础上，刘仁草对他们的工作做了妥善安排，调动了每个人的生产积极性。
    像这样善于开动思想机器的精神，毛泽东同志很早就大为提倡。他在《学习和时局》的讲演中说：“所谓开动机器，就是说，要善于使用思想器官。有些人背上虽然没有包袱，有联系群众的长处，但是不善于思索，不愿用脑筋多想苦想，结果仍然做不成事业。再有一些人则因为自己背上有了包袱，就不肯使用脑筋，他们的聪明被包袱压缩了。”这里，毛泽东同志不但讲了“多想苦想”的重要意义，也告诉了我们使用思想器官的办法。什么办法？有两条：一是放下包袱，二是联系群众。其实这两条，也是一个意思，只有放下包袱，才能更好地联系群众。包袱这东西，是要压人的。背起来不放，思想器官这个机器就很难开动；即使开动起来，也不灵活。只有放下这个包袱，才能轻装前进，广开思路，全面考虑问题。
    但是，要把问题考虑全面，一个人还有很大的局限性，还必须“有联系群众的长处”。因为我们提倡的多思苦想和胡思乱想根本不同，更不是脱离实际的幻想。它必须建立在事实的基础上，通过对事实的分析、概括，然后得出结论，指导实践。怎样了解实际呢？除了自己经常接触实际之外，还要经常保持同群众的联系。实践来自群众。一个干部若没“有联系群众的长处”，和实际完全隔离，纵使你多思苦想了一通，也是闭门造车，无济于事。但是，光“有联系群众的长处”，从群众那里收集了大量材料，没有思考，没有分析，最多只能发现问题，提出问题，还不能解决问题。这样，联系群众的威力，就不能充分发挥出来。刘仁草巧妙地安排劳动力的事例，正可以说明这点。当五人“智囊团”向他反映劳动力安排不集中的问题后，他开动思想机器，找到了一个“第一线里再抓第一线”的方法。不仅如此，当刘仁草通过生产发现了问题以后，他仍然继续开动思想机器，“心里还在做文章”，力求更深入、更多地解决问题。比如当他发现使用劳动力有漏洞时，便想到群众也会发现。当他和群众接触以后，果然，群众比他一个人发现得更多。刘仁草这种多思苦想的作风，和联系群众有密切关系，所以，它是符合客观实际的，能够使复杂的机器开足马力，不停地转动。
    目前，在农业生产第一线，集中了许多干部。他们具有大办农业、大办粮食的满怀热情，只要按照毛泽东同志多思苦想的教导去办事，又善于走群众路线，就一定能发挥更大的作用。
