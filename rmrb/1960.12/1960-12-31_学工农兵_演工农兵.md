	Learning from Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers; Performing as Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers
	Xinhua News Agency Reporter He Qilie, Lu Zuohua
	The Shanghai film scene is blooming. Veteran actors and newcomers to the screen are busy shooting and rehearsing more than a dozen new films of various themes and styles. They are playing workers, peasants, and soldiers, learning from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and are vigorously and energetically welcoming the second spring of the sixties.

	They Are All First-Timers
	The actors and directors shooting the large-scale art documentary "Sunflowers in Full Bloom" encountered so many "firsts" in this film. – The six actors in the crew who played the main roles: Zhang Hongmei, Wang Danfeng, Cheng Zhi, Zhu Sha, Zhang Hongxin, and Zhong Jingwen, have had screen lives of varying lengths. The longest, like Wang Danfeng, has been nearly twenty years, while the shortest, like Zhong Jingwen, has just started. However, everyone was a first-timer at playing industrial workers. Cheng Zhi, who often played "villainous roles," was playing an upright old worker for the first time. Wei Yuping independently directed, which was also a first.
	"Sunflowers in Full Bloom" is based on the advanced ideas and deeds of Cao Huiju, a female worker at the Shanghai Sewing Machine Needle Factory and a national advanced producer, who was selfless and helpful. It has been artistically processed and filmed.
	Precisely because they were all first-timers at playing industrial workers, everyone felt honored and therefore learned even more humbly from the workers. After the crew was established in December of last year, the actors, along with editor Zhao Qingge and director Wei Yuping, went to the Shanghai Sewing Machine Needle Factory one after another, working and living with the workers, and even following the workers to the factory school to participate in cultural studies. This period of time played a significant role in helping them shape the image of the workers.
	This film depicts a group of six workers with various different thoughts and personalities. Under the education of the Party and influenced by Cao Huiju-style advanced producer Zhou Yuzhen, they "not only want themselves to be good, but also want the collective to be good," and the whole group became an all-around success. Zhang Hongmei, the actress who played Zhou Yuzhen, said that during this period, Cao Huiju's modesty and simplicity left her with an unforgettable impression. When the film was shooting the scene where Xie Jinfang changed her original petty-bourgeois ideas and expressed to Zhou Yuzhen, "It's all thanks to your help!" Zhou casually replied, "What have I done? It's all your own efforts." Zhang Hongmei said that this sentence was Zhou Yuzhen's reply, but also Cao Huiju's usual saying, and it was also a word that she was naturally uttered after being infected by Cao Huiju.
	The actors all participated in the labor of grinding needles. Grinding needles, what a trivial job, but what a difficult job it is. It requires you to concentrate all your energy, and a slight negligence will produce waste products. The workers work so meticulously every day, which makes the actors deeply feel the noble qualities of the workers who love labor and cherish national property. Therefore, when performing the scene of criticizing Xie Jinfang for producing waste products, they injected their true feelings into the performance.

	Farmers Said: "It's Like It!"
	In the fields, old director Zheng Junli said "Attention," and only saw Fang Dongge (played by Xu Zhihua), a tractor driver with one leg half-kneeling on the ground, excitedly saying to Dean Jiang (played by Gao Bo) and Luo Stationmaster (played by Liu Hongsheng) of the schistosomiasis prevention station who came to inspect the schistosomiasis prevention work: "We used to plow the soil here with tractors and bury the Oncomelania hupensis snails under the soil. Today I see that they are all dead!" While casually picking up a snail with chopsticks, he looked at it and threw it into the bottle, saying: "Here!"…
	The filming of the exterior scenes of the film "The Everlasting Spring," which reflects the great struggle against schistosomiasis, went very smoothly. Shangguan Yunzhu (playing Dongge's mother) and Zhong Xinghuo (Li Daye in the film), who were standing next to them and observing carefully, had happy expressions on their faces. They expressed satisfaction with the movements, tone, and demeanor of the young student Xu Zhihua, who was appearing on the screen for the first time. Among the crowd who came to assist in the filming, there were several local farmers, and they all smiled and said while looking at Fang Dongge: "It's like it!" They are tractor drivers from the commune's tractor station. Xu Zhihua had spent a period of time with them, and in addition to learning how to drive a tractor, he also absorbed a lot of Dongge's spirit and temperament from them. There are several novices like Xu Zhihua in "The Everlasting Spring." Before the film started shooting, they came to Rentun Village in Qingpu County, near Shanghai, where schistosomiasis used to be severely prevalent, to participate in agricultural labor and learn from the farmers. You Jia, a young woman who entered the film industry for the first time and played the important role of Kumeizi, was only about ten years old at the beginning of liberation. For the past eleven years, she has been living in a happy and beautiful environment, and it was originally difficult for her to imagine Kumeizi's painful life. Now, they have lived with the members of Rentun Village for more than twenty days, and they can't restrain their feelings: cursing schistosomiasis, hating the old society that caused "thousands of villages to be barren and people defecating everywhere, and tens of thousands of households to be desolate and ghosts singing," and strongly demanding to sing praises to the life after liberation, where "spring breeze and willows are in thousands of strands, and 600 million Shenzhou are all like Yao and Shun." Many farmers talked to the actors about their experiences before and after liberation. Wu Haiquan, the captain of the production team, said: "If Chairman Mao had come a step later, this place would have become a wild graveyard with three feet of thatch." On the eve of liberation, he was already a late-stage patient with schistosomiasis, on the verge of death. After liberation, under the care of the Party and the government, Wu Haiquan, like the vast number of commune members, recovered his health, grew taller and stronger, and remarried. Under the education and inspiration of these characters, the image of Kumeizi played by You Jia gradually became fuller and more solid.

	"New Recruits" in the Company
	The film "Red Sun," adapted from the novel of the same name reflecting the Third Revolutionary Civil War, is about to start shooting. A few days ago, the crew held a combat exercise with the troops stationed on a small island.
	Not long after the exercise ended, the platoon leader suddenly ordered the soldiers to assemble again and head towards the small river. What was going on? It turned out that after receiving intelligence, all the dirty clothes and socks that the soldiers had changed were missing. The actors had taken them away through a clever surprise attack to wash and mend them. The platoon leader demanded that all the clothes and socks be recovered from the actors. However, the soldiers encountered resolute and brave opponents. In the end, the platoon leader had to announce: "Let's wash them together," which ended the "battle" by the small river.
	In order to familiarize themselves with the life of the troops, the actors lived, ate, and worked with the soldiers here, and also frequently participated in combat exercises. In the morning, they practiced with the soldiers, and in the evening, they studied Chairman Mao's writings together and discussed the "Three Eight" work style. Sometimes, they also asked some comrades from the troops who had participated in the Battle of Menglianggu to explain the battle stories of that year. The actors also read the "Red Sun" movie script to the soldiers and solicited their opinions.
	With the help of the commanders and fighters of the troops, the actors not only learned a lot of combat technical knowledge, but also received a profound ideological education.
	Once, in a combat exercise, the actors followed the soldiers on a forced march to intercept the "enemy." When they came to a vegetable field, the soldiers detoured around it. Later, when they came to a ditch, despite the cold weather and waist-deep water, the soldiers jumped down without hesitation. The soldiers' serious and earnest attitude, like treating it as a real battle, and their quality of cherishing the people's crops, deeply moved the actors. Later, when they encountered ditches and streams again, the actors did not hesitate and jumped over them with the soldiers. They believed that this was not only the "belief" required by acting skills, but also a quality that a people's film actor must possess.
	Currently, "Red Sun" has entered the rehearsal stage. The studio is divided into two large groups, "our army" and "enemy army," both with sets built. After returning from the island, the actors often wear military uniforms, practice exercises, and practice shooting and other military movements as they did on the island. So far, they have rehearsed all the indoor scenes.

    学工农兵　演工农兵
    新华社记者　何其烈　陆左华
    上海影坛，鲜花盛开。老演员和初上银幕的新手，正忙着拍摄和排练各种题材、各种样式的新片十多部。他们演工农兵，学工农兵，生气勃勃，干劲十足地迎接着六十年代的第二个春天。
    他们都是第一次
    拍摄大型艺术纪录片“向阳花开朵朵红”的演员和导演，在这部片子里碰到了那么多的“第一次”。——摄制组担任主要角色的六个演员：张鸿眉、王丹凤、程之、朱莎、张鸿鑫和钟静文，他们的银幕生活有长有短，长的如王丹凤有近二十年之久，短的如钟静文还是刚上银幕，可是大家对演产业工人都还是第一次。经常担任“反派角色”的程之，这是第一次演正面人物老工人。卫禹平独立担任导演工作，这也是第一次。
    “向阳花开朵朵红”是根据全国先进生产者、上海缝纫机针制造厂女工曹慧菊的舍己为人、助人为乐的先进思想、先进事迹，经过艺术加工摄制的。
    正因为他们都是第一次演产业工人，大家都感到光荣，也就更加虚心地向工人们学习。去年12月摄制组成立后，演员们和编辑赵清阁、导演卫禹平，先后到了上海缝纫机针制造厂，同工人们一道劳动，一道生活，甚至跟着工人一起到厂校去参加文化学习。这一段日子，对帮助他们塑造工人的形象起了很大作用。
    这部影片描写的一个小组六个工人，具有各种不同的思想、性格。他们在党的教育下，在曹慧菊式的先进生产者周玉珍的影响下，“不光自己好，还要集体好”，全组成了满堂红。扮演周玉珍的演员张鸿眉说，这一段日子，曹慧菊的谦虚、朴实，给她留下了难忘的印象。当影片拍到谢金芳转变原有的小康思想，向周玉珍表示“都是得到你的帮助！”的时候，周随口回答：“我有什么呢，都是你自己的努力。”张鸿眉说，这句话是周玉珍的回答，也是曹慧菊平常的口头禅，也是我受了曹慧菊的感染，很自然念出来的词儿。
    演员们都参加了磨针的生产劳动。磨针，这是一件多么平凡的工作，但又是多么艰巨的工作呀。它需要你集中全副精力，稍有疏忽，就会出废品。工人们这样天天一丝不苟地劳动着，使演员们深深感到工人热爱劳动，爱护国家财产的高尚品质。因此在演出批评谢金芳出了废品的一场戏时，他们就在表演中注入了自己的真情实感。
    农民说：“像了！”
    田野里，老导演郑君里说一声“注意”，只见一条腿半跪在地上的拖拉机手方冬哥（徐志骅饰），一边兴奋地对前来检查血吸虫病防治工作的江院长（高博饰）和血防站罗站长（刘鸿声饰）说：“以前我们拖拉机在这里翻过土，把钉螺埋在土底下。今天一看，全死啦！”一边用筷子随意拣起一只钉螺，看了看，丢进瓶里道：“喏！”……
    反映防治血吸虫病伟大斗争的影片“枯木逢春”，外景拍摄得很顺利。站在旁边仔细观察的上官云珠
  （演冬哥妈妈）和仲星火（片中的李大爷）一脸喜悦之色，他们对初上银幕的青年学生徐志骅的动作、语气、神态表示满意。前来协助拍摄的人群中，有几个本地的农民，他们望着方冬哥都乐得合不拢嘴说：“演得像！”他们是公社拖拉机站的拖拉机手。徐志骅曾同他们相处一个时期，除了学会开拖拉机，还从他们身上吸取了不少冬哥的精神气质。《枯木逢春》片里像徐志骅这样的新手就有好几个。在片子开拍之前，他们来到了上海附近过去血吸虫病严重流行的青浦县任屯村参加农业劳动，向农民学习。初进影坛并扮演苦妹子这个重要角色的女青年尤嘉，解放初还是十岁左右的孩子。十一年来她一直生活在幸福美好的环境里，对苦妹子的痛苦身世，本来是难以想像的。现在，他们同任屯村的社员们一起生活了二十多天，都抑止不住自己的感情：诅咒血吸虫病，憎恨造成“千村薜苈人遗矢，万户萧疏鬼唱歌”的旧社会，强烈要求歌颂解放后“春风杨柳万千条，六亿神州尽舜尧”的生活。多少个农民向演员们攀谈自己解放前后的遭遇。生产队大队长吴海泉说：“要是毛主席迟来一步，我们这里就将成为茅草三尺长的野坟堆了。”解放前夕，他已是血吸虫病的晚期病人，奄奄一息。解放后，在党和政府的关怀下，吴海泉和广大社员一样恢复了健康，身材长高长结实了，新娶了妻子。在这些人物的教育和启示下，尤嘉扮演的苦妹子形象就逐步丰满扎实起来。
    连队里的“新兵”
    根据同名小说改编的反映第三次国内革命战争的影片“红日”快要开拍了。前些日子，摄制组在一个小岛上与驻岛部队一起举行了一次战斗演习。
    演习结束不久，排长突然又命令战士们集合，向小河边进发。这是怎么回事？原来得到情报，战士们换下的脏衣服和脏袜子全部不翼而飞，被演员们以巧妙的突袭拿去洗和缝补去了。排长要求把所有的衣服和袜子从演员们手里收回来。可是战士们碰到了坚决、勇猛的对手。最后，排长不得不宣布：“大家一同洗吧”，这才结束了小河边的一场“争夺战”。
    演员们为了熟悉部队生活，在这里与战士们同吃同住同劳动，还经常参加战斗演习。早上，他们和战士一起练操，晚上一起学习毛主席著作，讨论“三八”作风。有时还请部队的一些曾经参加过孟良崮战役的同志讲解当年的战斗故事。演员们也把“红日”电影剧本读给战士们听，征求意见。
    在部队指战员的帮助下，演员们不仅学到许多战斗技术知识，而且受到了深刻的思想教育。
    有一次战斗演习，演员们跟着战士一同急行军去阻击“敌人”。当进行到一片菜地的时候，战士们都绕道跑过去，后来跑到一条水沟面前，尽管天寒水冷、水深齐腰，战士们都毫不犹豫地跳下去。战士们那种像对待真的战斗一样严肃、认真的态度，那种爱护人民庄稼的品质，使演员们很受感动。后来又碰到水沟、小河的时候，演员们都毫不迟疑，跟着战士们一跃而过。他们认为这不仅是表演技巧所要求的“有信念”，而且也是作为一个人民的电影演员必需具备的品质。
    目前，“红日”已经进入排戏阶段。摄影棚里分成了“我军”与“敌军”两个大组，都搭上了布景。演员们从海岛回来以后，经常穿着军装，像在小岛上一样练操和练习射击等各种军事动作。到现在，他们已把室内拍摄的场面，全部排练了一遍。
