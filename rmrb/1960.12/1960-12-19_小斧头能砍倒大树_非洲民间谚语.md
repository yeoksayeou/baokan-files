    A Small Axe Can Fell a Big Tree
    —African Folk Proverbs
    A bonfire should not be extinguished, only add fuel to it.
    A small axe can fell a big tree.
    You can't harvest figs from nettles.
    Even if you wash a lump of coal with water, it won't turn into white jade.
    Shouting is by no means a symbol of strength.
    If you want to squeeze lion's milk, you must have the courage to fight a lion.
    A hungry cat is never polite when it meets a chick.
    Don't throw sand on a crocodile—it doesn't bother it.
    No one wants to dance to the roar of a lion.
    A leopard's child is still a leopard.
    A monkey is still a monkey, even if you cut off its tail.
    Leopards and goats will never live in the same group.
    Even if you put a golden saddle on a donkey, it's still a donkey.
                              [Compiled by Wen Yi and Guang Zhou]

    小斧头能砍倒大树
    ——非洲民间谚语
    篝火不能扑灭，只应该往上添柴。
    小斧头能砍倒大树。
    荨麻上收不到无花果。
    煤块就是用水冲洗，也不会变成白玉。
    叫嚷绝不是实力的象征。
    要想挤狮奶，就得有斗狮的胆量。
    饿猫遇见小鸡，向来不讲客气。
    不要往鳄鱼身上撒沙子——这对它并不关痛痒。
    谁也不愿意在狮子的吼叫下舞蹈。
    豹的孩子还是豹。
    猴子，就是割掉尾巴，仍然是只猴子。
    豹子和山羊绝不会生活在同一个群里。
    哪怕是给驴子配上金鞍，驴子总归还是驴子。
                              〔闻一、光宙编译〕
