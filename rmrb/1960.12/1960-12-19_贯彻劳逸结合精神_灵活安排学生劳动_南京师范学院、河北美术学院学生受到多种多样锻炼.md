Xinhua News Agency report: Nanjing Normal College's Biology Department has achieved good results by arranging students to participate in physical labor, paying attention to the combination of work and rest.

Since 1958, the Biology Department of this college has established four specialized production labor bases within the school: plant cultivation, animal breeding, biological specimens, and biochemical products. It has also established ties with rural communes and factories outside the school. Therefore, when arranging student labor, they ensure a balance of work and rest and diversify labor. There is both on-campus labor and off-campus labor; both specialized labor and general labor; both concentrated labor for longer periods of three or four months and regular labor of about one hour per day. This variety of physical labor provides students with diverse training, strengthens their physical fitness, and improves teaching quality.

Many students, after participating in off-campus production labor, have raised their political awareness and strengthened their stance with the working people. Fourth-year students labored in a commune in Jurong County that had suffered from drought for two consecutive years. They heard poor and lower-middle peasants reflect that although they had suffered from the disaster, they were doing well because of the care of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao and the superiority of the People's Commune with its skillful planting arrangements; if they had encountered such a disaster before liberation, they would have had to sell their children and daughters and would have been unable to survive. Through contact with these practical matters in their labor, the students gradually understood the principle that the Party constantly emphasizes in its work of resolutely relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants. Many students have begun to learn to use the class analysis method to look at problems and examine their words and deeds.

Some students, while working in factories, were deeply moved by the spirit of the workers' hard work and bold innovation, and were also greatly inspired by their collectivist thinking of "everyone red, then glory." Many students felt happy because they could work with the workers to contribute to the completion of the national plan and add a brick or tile to the socialist mansion.

Students, through participating in various labors, have gradually developed good habits of loving labor. Now many students consciously pay attention to maintaining environmental hygiene every day, cleaning toilets, repairing manure buckets, rakes, and hoes themselves, and washing their clothes and sewing quilts themselves. After participating in various labors, students have also deepened their understanding of theoretical knowledge and their ability to work independently. In the first half of this year, some students helped Jurong Chengdong Commune establish two fertilizer plants capable of producing gibberellin, azotobacter, and phosphorus bacteria, further improving their theoretical knowledge and independent working ability.

Xinhua News Agency report: This semester, Hebei Academy of Fine Arts, while strengthening basic courses and extracurricular basic exercises, and adhering to the principle of combining work and rest, has further comprehensively arranged labor training for teachers and students, including both professional-related labor and general labor; both off-campus labor and on-campus labor. Because the labor is arranged flexibly and diversely, with varying lengths of time, it ensures that teachers and students have sufficient time to rest.

In addition to participating in labor in the art factory run by the college in batches and phases, students from various departments and classes in this college also engage in a variety of labor combined with their majors. This semester, teachers and students majoring in ceramics, printing and dyeing, and decoration in the Department of Arts and Crafts went to Tangshan Yufeng Porcelain Factory, the experimental factory of Tianjin Silk and Flax Textile Research Institute, and Tianjin Enamel Factory, respectively, to participate in labor related to their majors. In addition, the school also arranges some short-term labor according to the creative and teaching needs of different departments and grades, collecting creative materials while working. For example, when creating works such as "Hongshunli a Red Flag," "Xing Yanzi," and "Iron Girls," the students not only improved their creative level by collecting materials while working, but also received profound education in their thinking.

### 贯彻劳逸结合精神  灵活安排学生劳动  南京师范学院、河北美术学院学生受到多种多样锻炼

    贯彻劳逸结合精神  灵活安排学生劳动
    南京师范学院、河北美术学院学生受到多种多样锻炼
    据新华社讯　南京师范学院生物系安排学生参加体力劳动，注意劳逸结合，取得了良好效果。
    这个学院的生物系从1958年以来，就在校内建立了植物栽培、动物饲养、生物标本、生物化学制品等四个专业性的生产劳动基地，又与校外农村公社、工厂挂了钩，因而在安排学生劳动时，有劳有逸，做到劳动多样化。既有校内劳动，又有校外劳动；既有专业性劳动，又有一般性劳动；既有三、四个月较长时间的集中劳动，又有每天一小时左右的经常劳动。多种多样的体力劳动，使学生受到多种多样的锻炼，增强了体质，提高了教学质量。
    许多学生参加了校外的生产劳动以后，提高了政治觉悟，坚定了劳动人民的立场。四年级学生在句容县一个连续两年遭受旱灾的公社里劳动，听到贫雇农反映：虽然受了灾，但是因为共产党和毛主席关心，人民公社的优越性，抢种巧安排，生活过得还不错；要是在解放前遇到这样的灾害就要卖儿鬻女、难以活命了。学生们在劳动中接触到这些实际事物，逐渐懂得了党经常强调在工作中要坚决依靠贫雇农的道理。许多学生初步学会了用阶级分析方法来看问题和检查自己的言行。
    有些学生在工厂劳动时，看到工人刻苦钻研、大胆创造的精神，深深地被感动，看到工人们那种“大家红、才光荣”的集体主义思想也大受启发。很多学生因为自己能和工人一起为完成国家计划出一分力，能为社会主义大厦添加一砖一瓦而感到愉快。
    学生们参加各种劳动，逐渐养成了爱劳动的好习惯。现在很多学生每天自觉地注意保持环境卫生，打扫厕所，自己动手修理粪桶、钉耙、锄头，自己洗衣服、缝被子等。学生们参加多种劳动后，还加深了对理论知识的理解和独立工作的能力。今年上半年，有些学生帮助句容城东公社创办起两座能够生产赤霉素、固氮素、磷细菌的化肥厂，使学到的理论知识和独立工作的能力，都有进一步提高。
    据新华社讯　河北美术学院这学期在加强基础课和课外基本练习，注意劳逸结合的原则下，进一步全面安排了师生的劳动锻炼，既有与专业有关的劳动，又有一般的劳动；有校外劳动，也有校内劳动。由于劳动安排得灵活多样，时间有长有短，保证了师生们都有充分休息的时间。
    这个学院各系班的学生除分期分批到学院办的美术工厂参加劳动外，还结合专业进行多种劳动。这学期，工艺系陶磁、印染、装饰等专业的师生分别到唐山裕丰瓷厂、天津丝麻纺织研究所实验工厂和天津搪瓷厂等单位参加了有关专业的劳动。此外，学校还根据不同系级创作和教学上的需要，安排一些较短期的劳动，一面劳动，一面搜集创作题材。如在创作“鸿顺里一面红旗”、“邢燕子”、“铁姑娘”等作品时，学生们由于边劳动、边搜集题材，不仅提高了创作水平，在思想上也受到了深刻教育。
