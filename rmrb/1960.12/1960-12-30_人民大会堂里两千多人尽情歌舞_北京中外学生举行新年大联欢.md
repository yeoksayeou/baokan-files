Xinhua News Agency, December 29th. Beijing Chinese and foreign students held a grand New Year's Eve gala in the Great Hall of the People tonight. More than two thousand college students from the capital's universities and international students from over forty countries sang and danced to their hearts' content, celebrating new achievements in their studies in the New Year.

Jiang Nanxiang, Vice Minister of Education, congratulated the Chinese and foreign students on the New Year at the meeting. He said that China, in the cause of building socialism; in the cause of striving for world peace; in the struggle against the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression and war; and in the cause of opposing colonialism and supporting national liberation movements; is increasingly gaining the sympathy, support, and understanding of the people of all countries in the world, thereby increasingly enhancing our country's friendship and unity with the people of all countries. He said that the declaration of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries most powerfully demonstrated the unbreakable unity and invincible strength of the socialist camp. In the face of a situation full of light and victory, we are all gathered together to cheer for victory, and with full confidence, we wish and welcome even greater victories in 1961. Finally, Jiang Nanxiang congratulated the international students on their ability to achieve all-round development in moral, intellectual, and physical education, so that they can play a greater role in the glorious cause of building their own countries in the future.

The gala began amidst warm applause. In the center of the hall, foreign students and Chinese students danced gracefully, and they also played various games together under the corridors. Students from the Central Conservatory of Music, Tsinghua University, Beijing Art Normal College, Beijing Institute of Physical Education and other universities performed various cultural and sports performances.
