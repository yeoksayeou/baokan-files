"Public" First
Tang Xiaoding

In the Democratic Management District of Shicheng Commune in Bazhong, Sichuan, there is a Party Branch Secretary named Yang Shicheng. He was originally a Red Army company commander, and his health is not good due to old age. The organization asked him to enter a home for the elderly several times, but he insisted, "I can still continue to contribute, how can I let the Party and the people support me for nothing?" He works and lives with the masses, without any special treatment or airs. Some commune members advised him, "Secretary Yang, you are so old, you can just sit and direct our production." He replied, "To chop firewood, you have to go up the mountain, to catch fish, you have to go into the water. You can't lead production well if you don't participate in production." To this day, he still uses a quilt from the Anti-Japanese War and wears cotton clothes from the Liberation War. Considering that all his teeth have fallen out, the organization told him that he didn't have to eat in the public canteen and could cook separately, but he refused. One night in April this year, he was lying in bed with a high fever. In a daze, he heard a clap of thunder and immediately thought of the wheat stacks that had been harvested from more than 200 mu of fields and were drying on the branches. Forgetting his pain, he suddenly got out of bed, woke his wife, beat a gong and drum, sounded the alarm, and summoned people, and quickly stored the wheat stacks. When the torrential rain came, the commune members talked with joy and gratitude, "Our good secretary is truly a selfless person who forgets himself for the public."

A true Communist Party member has the word "public" first and foremost in his heart. For the sake of the people, for the sake of the collective, he will forget himself, consciously sacrifice himself, and righteously put personal interests in a subordinate position. The exploiters of the old society and all those blinded by greed only cared about their own wealth and did not care about the life or death of others. They were always scheming against each other, deceiving and betraying each other. As the saying goes, "The Yellow River is ten thousand feet deep but has a bottom, but the human heart is three feet deep and unfathomable." But the proletariat and its vanguard, the Communist Party members, their state of mind and will are as open as the blue sky and as radiant as the sun and moon. The primary reason they can be like this is that they have the word "public" in their hearts. This "public" is the core of communist ideology. With "public," there can be "togetherness." Cadres eat, live, work, and consult with the commune members together, like Yang Shicheng, without any special treatment or airs. This cannot be done without putting "public" first. The people's good servants, especially Party member cadres, with the word "public" in their hearts, can share blessings and hardships with the people. It will not be "togetherness" in form only, but true "togetherness." They can treat the people with the attitude of ordinary laborers and class brothers, with equal footing, emotion, and perspective. Moreover, only with "public" first, can there be differences within "togetherness," that is, striving to fulfill the responsibility of helping the people and leading the people, serving the people unconditionally, and consciously undertaking more of the obligations that must be borne for the victory of the proletarian cause. With "public" first and "togetherness," it will be easy to "communicate" between cadres and the people, between superiors and subordinates, and between left and right. "Public" and "togetherness" are the prerequisites and foundation for "communication." If the people do not think you are selfless, impartial, and forgetful of self, they will not believe what you say so readily, and they will not tell you everything they want to say, then it will be difficult to "communicate." Therefore, to communicate thoroughly, to communicate to the heart, it is necessary to achieve "togetherness" and "public."

Public, togetherness, and communication are the three checkpoints for implementing policies and doing a good job. Without "public," individualism develops; without "togetherness," there is special treatment; without "communication," there is mutual estrangement. In this way, one will naturally become detached from the masses, detached from reality, and unable to implement the Party's policies.

Public, togetherness, and communication reflect the morality of the proletariat and the essential relationships within the revolutionary ranks.

    “公”字当头
    唐小丁
    四川巴中石城公社民主管理区有一位党支部书记，姓杨名世成。他原是一位老红军连长，年老了，健康情况不好。组织上几次要他进敬老院，他都坚持说：“我还能继续贡献力量，怎能让党和人民白白养活我？”他同群众一起劳动，一起生活，没有半点特殊，没有半点架子。有的社员劝他说：“杨书记，你这么大年纪了，坐着指挥我们生产就行啦。”他回答说：“砍柴要上山，捉鱼要下水，不参加生产就领导不好生产。”他至今盖的是抗日战争时期的被子，穿的是解放战争时期的棉衣。组织上考虑到他的牙齿已全部脱落，告诉他不必在公共食堂吃饭，可以另外开伙，他怎么也不肯。今年4月的一个夜里，他躺在床上发高烧，恍惚中听到一阵雷响，便立即想到从两百多亩田里收下来晾在树丫上的麦垛。他忘了病痛，猛地翻身下床，推醒老伴，敲锣打鼓，传警召人，很快地收藏好了麦垛。暴雨倾盆来时，社员们庆幸而感激地交谈着：“我们的好书记呀，硬是个为公忘私的人。”
    一个名副其实的共产党员，他的胸中，首先有个“公”字。为了人民群众，为了集体，他会忘掉自己，自觉地牺牲自己，心安理得地把个人利益放到从属的位置上去。旧社会的剥削者和一切利欲熏心的人，是只管自己富贵，不管他人死活的。他们总是勾心斗角，尔虞我诈。正如俗语所说：“黄河万丈有底，人心三尺难测”。而无产阶级及其先锋队的共产党员呢，他们的心境和意志，好似蓝天那样坦荡，日月那样光耀。所以能够这样，首先在于胸中有个“公”字。这个“公”，是共产主义思想的核心。有了“公”，才能“同”。干部与社员群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，像杨世成那样，没有半点特殊，没有半点架子，如果不是“公”字当头，是办不到的。人民的好勤务员，特别是党员干部有了“公”字当头，就能同人民群众有福同享、有苦同尝，就不会是形式上的“同”，而是真正的“同”，就能以普通劳动者和阶级弟兄的身份、感情和眼光，以平等的态度，来对待人民群众。而且，只有“公”字当头，“同”之中才又有不同，即是努力地尽到帮助人民群众和领导人民群众之责，无条件地为人民群众效劳，自觉地更多地承担为无产阶级事业的胜利所必须承担的义务。一“公”二“同”，干部和人民群众之间，上下左右之间，就容易“通”了。“公”与“同”，是“通”的前提和基础。如果人民群众不认为你是大公无私、公而忘私的人，你说的他们会不那么信，他们想说的也不会向你全说，那就难“通”了。所以，要一通到底，一通到心，就必须做到“同”、做到“公”。
    公、同、通，是执行政策、做好工作的三关。不“公”则发展个人主义，不“同”则特殊化，不“通”则彼此隔阂。这样，就自然脱离群众，脱离实际，不能实现党的政策。
    公、同、通，反映了无产阶级的道德，反映了革命队伍内部的本质的关系。
