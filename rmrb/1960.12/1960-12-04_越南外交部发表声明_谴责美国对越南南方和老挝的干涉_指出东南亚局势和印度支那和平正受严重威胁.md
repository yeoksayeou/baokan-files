Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 3rd: According to reports in local newspapers today: The spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on December 2nd, strongly condemning the provocative actions of U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander Griffin, who announced that he had dispatched 1,500 Marines and many helicopters to the South China Sea, and would rapidly dispatch submarines equipped with "Polaris" rockets to the Western Pacific.

The statement said that, as is well known, U.S. imperialism is increasingly and blatantly interfering in South Vietnam and Laos, in order to realize its plot to prepare a new war in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

The statement said that U.S. imperialism is stepping up the destruction of the Geneva Accords, providing more weapons, uniforms, and military supplies to the South Vietnamese puppet regime, and strengthening the persecution of patriots and people who oppose the corrupt family rule of Ngo Dinh Diem.

The statement said that U.S. imperialism is trying every possible means to undermine the policy of peace, neutrality, and national harmony of the Kingdom of Laos government headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma. U.S. imperialism has repeatedly expressed "concern" about the situation in Laos, and declared that it would intervene in Laos by force. U.S. imperialism has openly supported and is supporting the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Noum Ratpasack rebel group against the Kingdom of Laos government. The statement pointed out that following the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's advisory meeting on November 16th to 18th to discuss the situation in South Vietnam and Laos, U.S. imperialism's strengthening of its military forces in the Indochina waters of the South China Sea is a new step in its entire plan to interfere in and invade this region. The above-mentioned provocative acts of U.S. imperialism seriously violate the Geneva Accords, making the situation in Indochina and Southeast Asia more tense, and threatening the peace and security of the people of Indochina.

The statement said that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly opposes the provocative actions of U.S. imperialism and declares that U.S. imperialism must bear full responsibility for the consequences it has caused.

    越南外交部发表声明
    谴责美国对越南南方和老挝的干涉
    指出东南亚局势和印度支那和平正受严重威胁
    新华社河内3日电　据此间报纸今天报道：越南民主共和国外交部发言人2日发表声明，严厉谴责美国第七舰队司令格里芬宣布已把一千五百名海军陆战队和许多直升飞机派到东海南面，并将把装备有“北极星”火箭的潜艇迅速地派到太平洋西部等挑衅行为。
  声明说，众所周知，美帝国主义日益明目张胆地对南越和老挝进行干涉，以实现其在印度支那和东南亚准备新战争的阴谋。
    声明说，美帝国主义正在加紧破坏日内瓦协议，对南越傀儡政权提供更多的武器、军装、军用物资，加强对爱国者以及反对吴庭艳腐朽的家族统治制度的人民的迫害。
    声明说，美帝国主义正在千方百计地破坏以梭发那·富马亲王为首的老挝王国政府的和平中立和民族和睦政策。美帝国主义对于老挝局势曾经多次表示“忧虑”，并宣称要以武力干涉老挝。美帝国主义曾经而且正在公然支持富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞叛乱集团反对老挝王国政府。声明指出，继东南亚条约组织在11月16日到18日举行顾问会议讨论南越和老挝局势之后，美帝国主义加强东海南面的印度支那海面上的军事力量，是它干涉和侵略这一地区的全部计划中的新的一步。美帝国主义的上述挑衅行为严重地违反了日内瓦协议，使印度支那和东南亚的局势更加紧张，威胁着印度支那各国人民的和平和安全。
    声明说，越南民主共和国政府强烈反对美帝国主义的挑衅行为，并且声明，美帝国主义对它所造成的后果必须担负全部责任。
