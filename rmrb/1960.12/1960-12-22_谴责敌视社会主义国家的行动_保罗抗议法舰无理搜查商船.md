Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, December 17th: The Bulgarian central newspaper published a statement by the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency on the 17th, stating that on November 9th of this year, French naval authorities illegally detained and searched the Bulgarian merchant ship "Vasil Levski" on the high seas of the Mediterranean. The Bulgarian government has lodged a formal protest with the French government regarding this matter. However, despite this, on December 4th of this year, French warships again illegally detained another Bulgarian merchant ship, the "Hristo Smirnenski," on the high seas of the Mediterranean.

The statement said: "There is no doubt that this action by the French authorities is a clear unfriendly act towards Bulgaria (with which France now maintains normal diplomatic relations) and will damage relations between the two countries."

The Bulgarian Telegraph Agency has learned that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of Bulgaria has submitted a new note to the French Legation in Sofia. The note strongly protested the actions of the French military authorities and stated that if similar incidents occur again in the future, the Bulgarian government will have to take necessary measures to protect the interests of Bulgarian merchant ships.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest: According to Romanian newspapers on the 18th, the Romanian freighter "Ardeal" was unreasonably searched by a French warship for two hours while sailing in the Mediterranean on the 16th. Romanian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Lezezeanu delivered a note of protest to the French Minister to Romania, Bouffanais, on the 17th.

    谴责敌视社会主义国家的行动
    保罗抗议法舰无理搜查商船
    据新华社索非亚电　保加利亚中央报纸17日刊载保加利亚通讯社的一项声明说，今年11月9日，法国海军当局在地中海公海非法拘留并搜查了保加利亚《瓦西尔·列夫斯基号》商船。保加利亚政府为此曾向法国政府提出过正式的抗议。但是，尽管如此，今年12月4日，法国军舰又在地中海公海非法拘留了另一艘保加利亚《赫里斯托·斯米尔宁斯基号》商船。
    声明中说：“毫无疑问，法国当局的这种行动是对保加利亚（法国现在与它保持着正常的外交关系）的明显的不友好行动，并且会损害两国的关系。”
    保加利亚通讯社获悉，保加利亚人民共和国外交部已向法国驻索非亚的公使馆递交了一份新的照会。照会中坚决抗议法国军事当局的行动，并且声明，如果今后再有类似事件发生，保加利亚政府将不得不采取必要措施，以保护保加利亚商船的利益。
    新华社布加勒斯特电　据罗马尼亚报纸18日消息：罗马尼亚货轮《阿尔德阿尔号》16日在地中海航行时遭到一艘法国军舰无理搜查达二小时之久。罗马尼亚外交部副部长勒泽雷亚努17日向法国驻罗马尼亚公使布法尼提出了抗议照会。
