From the "Newspaper Digest" column:

    The famous thesis of Comrade Mao Zedong that "all reactionaries are paper tigers" is a fundamental strategic thought of the revolutionary people and embodies the scientific world outlook of the proletariat. Comrade Mao Zedong's great strategic thought inherited and carried forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of Marx, Engels, and Lenin in strategically despising the enemy, and resounds throughout the world, becoming the death knell of capital imperialism and the clarion call for the victory of the people's revolution.

    “All reactionaries are paper tigers” is a scientific conclusion drawn from the laws of social and historical development, and the most thorough exposure and vivid generalization of the essence of reactionaries.

    Social development is always a process of new systems replacing old ones. The class that wants to maintain the old system will inevitably be overthrown; the class that represents the emerging forces will inevitably achieve final victory. The fettered productive forces must be liberated, and the decadent relations of production that fetter the liberation of productive forces must be smashed. This is the objective law of social development, which has been confirmed by thousands of years of social practice. The U.S.-Chiang reactionaries were maintaining imperialism and its colonial system, the semi-colonial and semi-feudal economic base and its superstructure, which was a serious obstacle to the development of China's social productive forces. But in no time, U.S. imperialism was overthrown on Chinese soil. The Chiang Kai-shek reactionary regime was eliminated, and China's productive forces were liberated from the shackles of imperialism and its running dogs. A brand-new socialist relation of production was born. Hasn't history proven it once again? It proves that the seemingly weak Chinese people were victorious, while the seemingly powerful robbers were defeated.

    The reason why reactionaries are bound to perish is that they are divorced from the people. There is no reason for those who oppose the people not to fail, and there is no reason for those who gain the support of the masses not to win. In the Third Revolutionary Civil War in China, although the number of the People's Liberation Army was only over 1.2 million at the beginning, how many more than millions or tens of millions of people rose up to support the people's war? An old Chinese saying goes: "Those who gain the Tao receive much assistance; those who lose the Tao receive little assistance." The more vicious and evil the reactionaries are, the more they mobilize the people to fight against them. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The more reactionaries kill people, the greater the revolutionary force will be, and the closer the reactionaries will be to their demise. This is an irresistible law."

    The atomic bomb in the hands of U.S. imperialism is also a paper tiger. The atomic bomb is a weapon with great destructive power, but having an atomic bomb without the support of the people is still an empty shell. To regard the atomic bomb as something magical, only seeing the role of things and not the role of people, is the theory of weapons and is fundamentally wrong for a revolutionary. The fundamental reason why the atomic bomb is a paper tiger and unreliable is that the people do not stand on the side of the reactionaries. Once the masses of the people are awakened, they are an invincible force. It is not the atomic bomb that eliminates the people, but the awakened people that eliminate the atomic bomb.

    If we do not dare to truthfully regard U.S. imperialism and all reactionaries as paper tigers, then we will first be defeated in spirit and thought, and our fighting will be disintegrated. What else can we talk about? Regarding all reactionaries as paper tigers and strategically despising them is the primary issue that all revolutionaries must resolve, the starting point of the Party's correct line and policy, and the fundamental principle that we must unswervingly adhere to under any circumstances of class strength comparison. Without this, there would be no revolution; abolishing this would abolish all revolutions.

    Regarding imperialism and all reactionaries, strategically, we say they are paper tigers, but tactically, we say they are real tigers. Because the reactionaries have not yet died, they still have considerable strength. What kind of strength do they have? On the whole, they still control the economic base of a certain society, they control the superstructure serving this economic base - the state machinery, especially the armed forces, in addition, they also control a set of experience in reactionary rule, and some of the masses are still temporarily deceived by political deception and have not yet awakened.

    Isn't it contradictory to say that reactionaries are both paper tigers and real tigers? The answer is no. Imperialism and all reactionaries have a dual nature. Paper tigers and real tigers are two sides of the same reactionary thing. We must see both the weak paper tiger side of the reactionaries and the fierce real tiger side. Strategically despising the enemy and tactically valuing the enemy is precisely our whole set of fighting art in dealing with the dual nature of the enemy.

    Why do Marxists-Leninists dare to strategically despise the enemy and tactically value the enemy and seriously deal with it? The reason is nothing more than that we are dialectical materialists, who can clearly see the essence of things without being confused by temporary "powerful" phenomena, and who can clearly see the law that everything will inevitably transform into its opposite under certain conditions, and not regard things as fixed and unchanging. Decadent social systems will inevitably be replaced by new social systems. This is the general trend of historical development. But this basic trend is realized through class struggle. The reactionaries will not automatically withdraw from the stage of history. In every specific struggle, there are two possibilities for revolutionary forces: victory and failure. Seeing the general trend, strategically despising the enemy, we are not afraid of failure or difficulties, and even if we fail temporarily, we are not pessimistic, but dare to sum up experience and learn lessons, and dare to fight again; seeing that the reactionaries still have power temporarily, we can seriously treat the struggle, so that we can win every battle and be invincible.

    The road of revolution is tortuous. Therefore, we must pay attention to the art of struggle, and adopt appropriate forms of struggle and methods of operation according to different times, places and conditions, so as to isolate and eliminate the enemy step by step. During the Third Revolutionary Civil War in China, in the situation where the enemy was strong and we were weak, we, as a whole, defeated the many with the few, but in every actual local struggle, we must defeat the few with the many. This is the dialectic of constantly accumulating small victories into large victories, promoting the qualitative leap of the balance of power between the enemy and us from quantitative accumulation to qualitative change in part, and from partial qualitative change to complete qualitative change. In the situation where we are strong and the enemy is weak, we must also value the enemy tactically, and maintain a high degree of vigilance against the enemy's conspiracies and sabotage. In specific struggles, to despise the enemy, thinking that the enemy is already weak and there is no need to deal with them seriously, and that they will automatically surrender, is essentially still right-leaning opportunist thought and will lead to great mistakes.

    The complete transformation of the real tiger side of the reactionaries into paper tigers is a process of mutual waxing and waning of the enemy and our forces. The occurrence of transformation requires certain conditions. This condition is that hundreds of millions of people become awakened, organized, and under the leadership of the vanguard of the working class, thoroughly smash the reactionary ruling state machine, and completely eliminate the main tools of reactionary ruling power - their armed forces. If the revolutionary people do not strive to create these conditions, the transformation of the reactionaries from real tigers to paper tigers will not be possible. Of course, these conditions are gradually created and can be completely created, because the people are the true creators of history and the subject of class struggle. Only when the masses of the people rise up to carry out revolutionary struggle can the decisive conditions for the realization of the transformation of the reactionaries from real tigers to paper tigers be realized. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out as early as 1934: "Uniting millions of people around the revolutionary government and developing our revolutionary war, we can eliminate all counter-revolutionaries and seize all of China." In December 1947, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The patriotic, just and revolutionary nature of the war of the People's Liberation Army is bound to win the support of the people throughout the country. This is the political foundation for defeating Chiang Kai-shek." The historical facts of the victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary war fully prove the correctness of this argument by Comrade Mao Zedong.

    From this, it can be seen that the task of the proletarian revolutionaries is to recognize the transformation of the reactionaries from real tigers to paper tigers, and to actively promote the realization of this transformation. Comrade Mao Zedong's thought of strategically despising the enemy and tactically valuing the enemy embodies the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat and becomes a Marxist-Leninist law because it truly grasps the dialectical relationship between the "paper tiger" and the "real tiger" of the reactionaries, grasps the fundamental conditions for the transformation of the reactionaries from real tigers to paper tigers, and the fighting art of resolutely relying on the masses of the people to promote this transformation. This closely combines the proletarian's fearless revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win with the fighting art of being good at struggling and being good at winning, reveals the fundamental law for the revolutionary people to overcome the enemy and win, and fundamentally guarantees the complete victory of the Chinese people's revolution.

    伟大的革命战略思想
    杨永直
    毛泽东同志关于“一切反动派都是纸老虎”的著名论点，是革命人民的一个根本战略思想，是无产阶级的科学世界观的体现。毛泽东同志这一伟大的战略思想，继承和发扬了马克思、恩格斯、列宁的在战略上藐视敌人的彻底革命精神，而磅礴于世，成为资本帝国主义的丧钟，成为人民革命胜利的号角。
    “一切反动派都是纸老虎”，是根据社会历史发展的规律而得出的科学结论，是对反动派本质的最彻底的揭露和最生动的概括。
    社会发展总是由新的制度代替旧的制度。那个阶级要维护旧制度，它就一定要被推翻；那个阶级代表新兴的力量，它就一定要取得最后的胜利。被束缚的生产力一定要解放，束缚生产力解放的腐朽的生产关系一定要被打碎，这是社会发展的客观规律，已为几千年来的社会实践所证实。美蒋反动派维护的是帝国主义及其殖民制度，是半殖民地半封建的经济基础及其上层建筑，这种制度，正是我国社会生产力发展的严重障碍。可是曾几何时，美帝国主义在中国的国土上被打倒了。蒋介石反动政权被消灭了，我国的生产力从帝国主义及其走狗的束缚下解放了出来，一个崭新的社会主义生产关系诞生了。历史不是又一次证明了吗？它证明胜利的是看来暂时弱小的中国人民，失败的却是看来十分强大的强盗。
    反动派之所以必然要趋于灭亡，是由于它脱离人民。凡是与人民作对的无有不败之理，凡是获得人民群众拥护的，无有不胜之理。在我国第三次国内革命战争中，人民解放军的数量开始虽然只有一百二十多万，但是纷纷起来支援人民战争的群众岂止几百多万、几千万？我国老话说：“得道者多助，失道者寡助”。反动派愈是穷凶极恶，就愈是动员人民起来和它进行斗争。正如毛泽东同志所说：“反动派杀人越多，革命的力量就越大，反动派就越接近于灭亡。这是一条不可抗拒的法则。”?
    美帝国主义手里拿着的原子弹也是一只纸老虎。原子弹是一种杀伤力较大的武器，但是有原子弹而没有人民的拥护，原子弹仍然是一个空家伙。把原子弹看得神乎其神，只见物的作用，不见人的作用，这是唯武器论，对一个革命者来说是根本错误的。原子弹所以是纸老虎，是靠不住的东西，其根本原因就是人民不站在反动派那一边。人民群众一旦觉悟起来以后，就是不可战胜的力量。不是原子弹消灭人民，而是觉醒了的人民消灭原子弹。
    不敢把美帝国主义和一切反动派如实地看成纸老虎，那么，首先就在精神上、思想上打了败仗，瓦解了斗志，那还用谈其他吗？把一切反动派都看成纸老虎，在战略上藐视它们，是一切革命者都必须解决的首要问题，是党的正确路线和政策的出发点，是我们在阶级力量对比的任何情况下都必须坚持不渝的根本原则。没有这一条，就没有革命；取消这一条，就取消了一切革命。
    对于帝国主义和一切反动派，从战略上看，我们说它是纸老虎，从战术上看我们又说它是真老虎。因为反动派还没有死亡，它还有相当的力量。它们有些什么力量呢？从总体上看来，它们还掌握着一定社会的经济基础，它们掌握着为这一经济基础服务的上层建筑——国家机器，特别是武装部队，此外他们还掌握着一套反动统治的经验，一部分群众还暂时受着政治欺骗的蒙蔽，还没有觉醒起来。
    既说反动派是纸老虎，又说它是真老虎，岂不自相矛盾？答曰，否。帝国主义和一切反动派都具有两重性，纸老虎和真老虎正是反动派的这一事物的两面。我们既要看到反动派虚弱的纸老虎的一面，又要看到它凶恶的真老虎的一面。从战略上藐视敌人与从战术上重视敌人，这也正是我们对待敌人的两重性的一整套斗争艺术。
    为什么马克思列宁主义者敢于从战略上藐视敌人，又能从战术上重视敌人，认真对付它呢？原因无它，无非是由于我们是辩证唯物主义者，看得清楚事物的本质而不被暂时的“强大”的现象所迷惑，看得清楚事物在一定条件下无不向它的反面转化的规律，而不把事物看作是固定不变的东西。腐朽的社会制度必然要被新生的社会制度所代替，这是历史发展的总趋势。但是这一基本趋势是通过阶级斗争而得到实现的。反动派是不会自动退出历史舞台的。在每一具体的斗争中，革命力量总有胜利和失败的两种可能性。看到总的趋势，在战略上藐视了敌人，就不怕失败，不怕困难，即使一时失败了也不悲观，而敢于总结经验、吸取教训，敢于再作斗争；看到了反动派暂时还有力量，就能认真对待斗争，这样就能百战百胜，立于不败之地。
    革命的道路是曲折的。因此就要讲究斗争艺术，根据不同的时间、地点和条件，采取适当的斗争形式和作战方法，以便一步一步地孤立敌人和消灭敌人。在我国第三次国内革命战争时期，在敌强我弱的情况下，我们在整体上，是以少胜多，但在每一个实际的局部斗争中，又必须以多胜少。这就是不断的积小胜为大胜，促使敌我力量对比由量的积累达到质的飞跃，由局部质变达到全部质变的辩证法。在我强敌弱的情况下，同样要在战术上重视敌人，对于敌人的阴谋破坏，要保持高度警惕。在具体斗争中，轻视敌人，以为敌人已经弱小了，可以不必认真对付了，他们将会自动投降了，那实质上仍然是右倾机会主义思想，是要犯绝大的错误的。
    反动派的真老虎一面彻底转化为纸老虎，这是一个敌我力量相互消长的过程。转化的发生需要一定的条件，这个条件就是亿万人民群众觉悟起来，组织起来，在工人阶级先锋队领导之下，通过革命斗争，彻底打碎反动统治的国家机器，彻底消灭反动统治权力的主要工具——它们的武装力量。革命人民不去努力创造这些条件，反动派由真老虎向纸老虎的转化就不可能。当然这些条件是逐步创立，也是完全可以创立的，因为人民是历史的真正的创造者，是阶级斗争的主体。只有人民群众起来进行革命斗争，才是使反动派实现其由真老虎向纸老虎转化的决定条件。毛泽东同志早在1934年就已经指出：“在革命政府的周围团结起千百万群众来，发展我们的革命战争，我们就能消灭一切反革命，我们就能夺取全中国。”?在1947年12月，毛泽东同志又说：“人民解放军的战争所具有的爱国的正义的革命的性质，必然要获得全国人民的拥护。这就是战胜蒋介石的政治基础。”?中国人民革命战争胜利的史实，完全证明了毛泽东同志这一论证的正确。
    由此可见，无产阶级革命派的任务，就是要承认反动派由真老虎向纸老虎的转化，并且积极促进这一转化的实现。毛泽东同志的战略上藐视敌人，战术上重视敌人的思想，所以体现了无产阶级彻底革命的精神，成为马克思列宁主义的定律，就在于它真正把握了反动派的“纸老虎”和“真老虎”之间的辩证关系，把握了反动派由真老虎到纸老虎转化的根本条件，以及坚决依靠人民群众促成这一转化的斗争艺术。这就把无产阶级敢于斗争、敢于胜利的大无畏革命气概和善于斗争、善于胜利的斗争艺术紧紧结合起来，揭示出了革命人民克敌制胜的根本法则，从根本上保证了我国人民革命的彻底胜利。
