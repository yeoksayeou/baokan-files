    Not Letting Wheat Rust Overwinter
    Sun Zhitong, the leader of the Fourth Production Team of the Xinhe Production Brigade in Banpu Commune, Guanyun County, Jiangsu Province, was inspecting the growth of wheat seedlings in the field one day when he saw yellowing wheat leaves with rows of yellow spots. He knew that it was wheat rust, and immediately mobilized the commune members to discuss how to prevent and control it. At the meeting, a few people believed that wheat rust would not spread in the cold winter and that it would not be too late to control it in the spring. Technician Sun Guiming held up the diseased wheat plants for everyone to see, explaining the harm of rust and the principle of "treating one plant this winter, saving ten thousand next spring." In the end, the commune members concluded: "Wheat rust cannot be allowed to overwinter." Thus, a mass movement to eliminate rust began. The methods of prevention and control combined both indigenous and foreign methods. In addition to using pesticides such as barium polysulfide and lime sulfur mixture, grass ash water and salt water were also used for prevention and control. These methods were very effective. Within ten days, the diseased wheat seedlings had been treated twice, and the wheat rust had stopped spreading, and the diseased wheat seedlings had improved.

    不让麦锈病过冬
    江苏灌云县板浦公社新河生产队第四生产小队队长孙植通，一天在田里检查麦苗生长情况，看到有发黄的麦叶，叶片上还有成行的黄点点，就知道是发生了麦锈病，立即发动社员讨论如何防治。会上，有少数人认为麦锈病在冬季天寒时不会蔓延，等明年春天除治也不晚。技术员孙桂明就拿着小麦病株给大家看，边看边讲锈病的危害性，说明“今冬治一株、明春少一万”的道理。最后，社员们得出结论：“不能让麦锈病过冬”。于是一个群众动手除治锈病的运动开展起来了。除治办法是土洋并举，除了用多硫化钡、石灰硫磺合剂等农药外，还用草木灰水、食盐水进行防治。这些防治方法的效果都很好，在十天内，发病的麦苗已普遍防治了两遍，麦锈病已停止发展，发病麦苗有了好转。
