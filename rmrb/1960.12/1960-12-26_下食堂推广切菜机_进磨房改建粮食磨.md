Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 24th. Many people's communes in the Pingliang area of ​​Gansu Province are carrying out mass movements to reform grain processing and canteen cooking tools. According to statistics from mid-November, since the beginning of this year, a total of more than 2,100 animal-powered multi-purpose mills, more than 1,300 rice milling machines, and 130 new and renovated water mills have been built or renovated. One-quarter of the production teams in the region have set up small flour processing plants, which greatly facilitates the unified processing and management of grain. The vast majority of canteens are equipped with vegetable cutting machines, noodle pressing machines or noodle pressing bars, steamers and other equipment; and more than 70% of the canteens have converted old stoves into suction stoves. In this way, a total of more than 39,000 laborers and 17,000 head of livestock were saved, strengthening the front line of agricultural production.

In this tool reform movement, 683 commune and team agricultural tool repair plants in the Pingliang area mobilized more than 80% of their skilled workers to specialize in the reform of mills and cooking utensils. Each factory, according to the local situation, divided its forces into two groups. One group stayed in the factory to manufacture standard products and main parts, and the other went to the canteens and mill rooms to cooperate with the production team's iron and wood workers to carry out reforms. Various localities have also vigorously grasped the selection and appraisal work. The Pingliang Special District organized a group of technicians and workers, along with commune members, to appraise eight kinds of animal-powered multi-purpose mills, which have now been promoted throughout the region and are very popular among the masses. The common characteristics of these mills are: simple manufacture, convenient operation, low cost, and good work efficiency.

    下食堂推广切菜机
    进磨房改建粮食磨
    据新华社兰州24日电甘肃省平凉地区许多人民公社开展群众性的粮米加工和食堂炊事工具改革运动。据11月中旬的统计，今年以来共已改制畜力带动的多合磨两千一百多台，碾米机一千三百多台，新建和改建水磨一百三十处。全区已有四分之一的生产队办起了小型面粉加工厂，大大便利了粮食统一加工管理；绝大部分食堂都有了切菜机、压面机或压面杠子、笼屜等设备；还有70％以上的食堂把旧锅灶改成了吸风灶。这样，一共节约了劳力三万九千多人，畜力一万七千多头，加强了农业生产第一线。
    在这一工具改革运动中，平凉地区六百八十三个社队农具修配厂，调动了80％以上的技术工人，专门从事磨和炊具的改革。各厂又根据地区情况，把力量分成两路，一路留厂自造正规产品和主要配件，一路下到食堂、磨房，协同生产队的铁木工人，进行改革。各地还大抓了选型鉴定工作。平凉专区组织了一批技术人员、工人，和社员一道，鉴定了八种畜力多合磨，现已在全区推广，很受群众欢迎。这些磨的共同特点是：制造简单，操作方便，造价低，工效好。
