In industrial and mining enterprises, the production team is the most basic organization, and all tasks of the enterprise must be completed through it. Especially after the widespread implementation of worker participation in management in various enterprises, the production team not only needs to specifically organize workers to carry out production activities, but also to guide workers to participate in management work. This means that the production team needs to more comprehensively grasp production, life, and political ideology, and manage all aspects of work. The experience of units such as the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant shows that in order for the production team to effectively undertake such tasks, earnestly playing the core role of the Party group is an extremely important link. Although the Party group is not a basic-level Party organization, it is an organic component of the basic-level Party organization. It is like the blood vessels of the human body, distributed in all aspects of industrial and mining enterprises. The Party group fights on the front lines of production and construction. Every Party member of the Party group produces and lives with the workers every day. The Party group and its members understand most clearly and specifically what new situations, new problems, and new experiences there are in production and work, what this or that worker is thinking, what their hobbies and temperaments are, what difficulties they have in work and life, and even what each person's family relationships are like. Not only that, but because the Party members in the production team have the closest relationship with the workers in their group, even being their closest friends, and have a certain prestige among the masses, it is also easiest to achieve results by working with the workers through them. All this shows that the basic-level Party organization of industrial and mining enterprises, in order to well play the role of a link with the masses and play the role of a fighting fortress in its work, must place its work on the foundation of doing a good job in the work of the Party group.

Of course, giving full play to the role of the Party branch committee and the Party branch member meeting is the main aspect of the activities of the basic-level Party organization. There should be absolutely no weakening of this aspect. However, since a basic-level Party organization often has dozens or even hundreds of Party members, if the basic-level Party organization wants to carry out activities effectively, it cannot only pay attention to doing a good job in the work of the branch or general branch itself, but must also pay attention to grasping the work of the Party group and giving play to the role of the Party group. Only in this way can the strength of the entire Party be used, and can the Party's leading role be reflected in all aspects of the enterprise. After the Party committee of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant universally strengthened the work of the Party group, the fighting fortress role of the Party branch was brought into fuller play, the entire organization became more "alive" and "flexible," and the work became easier, because there were the "eyes" of the Party branch everywhere, and the "hands" of the Party branch everywhere. The Party branch was not only relying on a few committee members, but relying on all Party members to carry out the work.

Under the strong leadership of the Party branch, earnestly doing a good job in the work of the Party group can make the Party's ideological and political work and material guarantee work for the workers and staff more easily effective. Because doing so can enable Party members to be constantly supervised and educated by the Party, continuously improve their political and ideological awareness, and enable each Party member to actively and proactively contact the masses, and resolutely implement the Party's policies and production plans. In this way, the Party organization of the enterprise has a reliance in all aspects. Whenever a policy or work task is assigned, it can work on the masses through the Party group and Party members, and quickly turn them into practical actions of the masses, thereby better exerting the Party's leading role over the masses. The "Steel Assault Team" Party group of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the Pumping Station Party group of Xiaoxiba Iron Plant in Sichuan fully played this core role. Whenever there were any instructions from higher authorities, or any new tasks were assigned, they immediately held meetings to study how to implement them. Whenever any problems occurred in production and work, or any difficulties were encountered, they promptly studied and resolved them. Whenever there were any advanced deeds or good experiences among the workers, they promptly commended and promoted them. Moreover, Party members always took the lead in front of the masses in everything, using their own exemplary actions to influence and lead the masses. This set a living example for the masses and united the masses more closely around the Party. At the same time, earnestly grasping the work of the Party group can also truly enliven, deepen, and refine ideological and political work. Ideological and political work is the main work of the basic-level Party organization. However, carrying out ideological and political work by only talking about empty general principles, without combining it with the actual production, life, and thinking of the workers, has no vitality. Carrying out ideological and political work on the masses through the Party group can not only avoid this general problem, truly achieve being targeted and prescribing the right medicine, but can also carry out ideological and political work on each person, even in each worker's home, so that many problems in production and life that seem small but affect the workers' emotions can be resolved in a timely manner. The "Steel Assault Team" of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the Pumping Station Party group of Xiaoxiba Iron Plant in Sichuan played such a role, so their ideological and political work was done well, the workers' ideological awareness was improved quickly, and the production tasks were completed excellently.

The two investigation reports, "Give Full Play to the Fighting Role of the Party Group" and "A Party Group Good at Grasping Ideological Work," provide us with important experience in how to do a good job in the work of the Party group. These experiences are mainly: First, the Party branch must fully recognize the importance of doing a good job in the work of the Party group and earnestly grasp it as an important task. The Party branch should regularly study the work of the Party group, often send people down to understand the situation, discover and solve problems, and give them practical help and guidance, and at the same time pay attention to promptly promoting their experience. The strong leadership of the Party branch is the key to doing a good job in the work of the Party group. Second, attention should be paid to giving play to the exemplary leading role of Party members. This requires strengthening the ideological education of Party members, ensuring that Party members can regularly participate in organizational life, earnestly carry out criticism and self-criticism, so that all the good qualities and good work styles of Party members can be carried forward, and bad ideas and unhealthy tendencies can be promptly corrected and overcome. Third, the Party group should focus on doing a good job in production, closely contact the masses, do a good job in the ideological and political work of the masses, educate the masses to conscientiously implement the Party and the state's policies and production plans, and carry out competition between groups and between people, as the main content of its work, and at the same time vigorously care for the lives of the masses. Only in this way can the masses and Party members progress together, and can the masses constantly maintain high political enthusiasm and production initiative. These few experiences are of great reference value for the basic-level Party organizations of all industrial and mining enterprises. The basic-level Party organizations of various industrial and mining enterprises should attach more importance to giving play to the role of the Party group in the future, and make their work more in-depth, more detailed, and more specific. This will have extremely beneficial effects on improving the level of the Party's work and on ensuring the more in-depth development of the increased production and thrift movement centered on grain and steel.

    为什么要注意抓好党小组的工作
    应麟
    在工矿企业里，生产小组是最基层的组织，企业的各项工作都要通过它来完成。特别在各个企业广泛实行工人参加管理以后，生产小组不但要具体地组织工人进行生产活动，而且要指导工人参加管理的工作。这就是说，生产小组需要更加全面地抓生产、抓生活、抓政治思想，把各方面的工作都管起来。石景山钢铁厂等单位的经验说明，为了使生产小组有效地担负起这样的任务，认真地发挥党小组的核心作用，是一个极其重要的环节。党小组虽然不是党的基层组织，却是党的基层组织的有机组成部分，它就像人体的血管一样，分布在工矿企业的各个方面。党小组战斗在生产建设的最前线，党小组的每个党员每天和工人在一起生产和生活，生产和工作中有些什么新的情况、新的问题和新的经验，这个或那个工人在想些什么，他们的爱好和脾气怎样，工作和生活中有什么困难，以至每个人的家庭关系如何，党小组和党小组的成员了解得最清楚、最具体。不仅如此，而且由于生产小组中的党员们和本组工人的联系最密切，甚至是最亲近的朋友，在群众中有一定的威信，因此通过他们去向工人进行工作，也最容易收到效果。这些都说明，工矿企业的基层党组织，为要很好地发挥联系群众的纽带作用，发挥在工作中的战斗堡垒作用，就要把自己的工作放在搞好党小组工作这个基点上。
    当然，充分发挥党支部委员会和支部党员大会的作用，是基层党组织活动中的主要方面。对于这一方面绝不应该有任何的削弱。但是，由于一个基层党组织往往有几十个甚至上百个党员，基层党组织要想有效地进行活动，就不能只注意搞好支部或总支部本身的工作，必须同时注意抓好党小组的工作，发挥党小组的作用。只有这样，才能把全党的力量都使用起来，才能使党的领导作用在企业的各个方面都能体现出来。石景山钢铁厂党委普遍地加强了党小组的工作以后，党支部的战斗堡垒作用就发挥得更加充分，整个组织就更加“活了”、“灵了”，工作就更加好做了，因为处处都有了党支部的“眼”，处处都有了党支部的“手”，党支部不是仅仅依靠少数几个委员，而是依靠全体党员来进行工作了。
    在党支部的坚强领导下，认真地做好党小组的工作，能使党对职工群众的思想政治工作和物质保证工作更易于收到效果。因为这样做，可以使党员经常地受到党的监督和教育，不断地提高他们的政治思想觉悟，使每个党员都能积极主动地去联系群众，都能坚决地执行党的方针政策。这样，企业的党组织就在各个方面都有了依靠，每当一项方针政策或工作任务布置下来以后，就可以通过党小组和党员对群众进行工作，把它们迅速地变为群众的实际行动，从而更好地发挥党对群众的领导作用。石景山钢铁厂的“钢铁突击队”党小组和四川小溪坝铁厂的抽水机站党小组，就充分发挥了这种核心作用。每当上级有什么指示，或者有什么新的任务布置下来，他们都立即开会研究如何贯彻执行；生产和工作中发生了什么问题，碰到什么困难，他们都及时地研究解决；工人中间有什么先进的事迹和好的经验，他们都及时地予以表扬和推广。而且党员们遇事总是走在群众的前面，用自己的模范行动去影响和带动群众，这就为群众树立了活生生的榜样，把群众更紧密地团结在党的周围。同时，认真地抓好党小组的工作，还可以把思想政治工作真正做活、做得深入和细致。思想政治工作是基层党组织的主要工作。但是进行思想政治工作，光讲空洞的大道理，不结合工人的生产、生活和思想的实际，那是没有生命力的。通过党小组向群众进行思想政治工作，就不但可以避免这种一般化的毛病，真正做到有的放矢和对症下药，而且可以把思想政治工作做到每个人的身上，甚至做到每个工人的家里，使工人中许多看来很细小、但是对工人的情绪发生影响的生产和生活中的问题得到及时的解决。石景山钢铁厂“钢铁突击队”和四川小溪坝铁厂抽水机站的党小组发挥了这样的作用，他们的思想政治工作也就做得好，工人的思想觉悟也就提高得快，生产任务也就完成得很出色。
    “充分发挥党小组的战斗作用”和“一个善于抓思想工作的党小组”这两份调查报告，在如何抓好党小组的工作方面为我们提供了重要的经验。这些经验主要是：第一，党支部要充分地认识搞好党小组工作的重要性，把它作为一项重要的工作认真地抓起来。党支部要定期研究党小组的工作，要经常派人下去了解情况，发现和解决问题，给予他们切实的帮助和指导，同时还要注意及时地推广他们的经验。党支部的坚强领导，这是做好党小组工作的关键。第二，要注意发挥党员的模范带头作用。这就必须加强对党员的思想教育工作，必须使党员都能定期地过组织生活，认真地开展批评和自我批评，使党员中一切好的品质，好的思想作风得到发扬，使坏的思想和歪风邪气得到及时的纠正和克服。第三，党小组要以搞好生产为中心，把密切联系群众，做好对群众的思想政治工作，教育群众认真执行党和国家的方针政策和生产计划，开展组与组和人与人之间的竞赛，做为自己工作的主要内容，同时还要大力地关心群众的生活。只有这样，才能使群众和党员一道进步，才能使群众经常保持高涨的政治热情和生产积极性。这几条经验，对于一切工矿企业的基层党组织都是很有参考价值的。各个工矿企业的基层党组织今后都应该更加重视发挥党小组的作用，把自己的工作作得更加深入、更加细致、更加具体，这对于提高党的工作的水平，对于保证以粮钢为中心的增产节约运动的更加深入的开展，将会产生极其有益的效果。
