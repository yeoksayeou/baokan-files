    The Soviet working people warmly support the statement of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries.
    Unity is the source of victory for socialist forces.
    (Reported by this newspaper) The Soviet working people warmly support the statement of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries.
    In the Soviet capital, this great document has become the focus of attention for the vast majority of the people. When the document was published in the newspapers, the workers of the "Red Proletarian" factory in Moscow were very excited. During shift breaks, during short lunch breaks, and after work, people discussed this remarkable document in groups, expressing their opinions and impressions.
    Comrade Yermilov, a famous producer, a hero of socialist labor, and a fitter, said: "This statement is inspiring. It once again confirms the unbreakable unity of the entire world communist movement and the entire socialist camp. No one can destroy this great friendship. This friendship is the source of our strength and the foundation of all our glorious victories."
    In the workshop where one of the oldest producers, foreman Ivanov, works, a mass meeting was held after a shift ended.
    The workshops of the glorious "Dynamo" factory also organized reading and discussion of the meeting statement, and held short mass meetings.
    Ivan Lukyanov, one of the oldest producers and a member of the CPSU since 1930, said at a mass meeting: "I read the meeting statement with great interest and concern. This is a great document of our great era. It once again shows the world that the unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties and the peoples of socialist countries, and their unwavering faith in the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, are the main sources of strength and invincibility for our great camp of peace."
    The oil workers of Azerbaijan enthusiastically discussed the statement of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties. The oil workers unanimously agreed with the meeting statement, believing that this statement is a fighting program for the world communist movement to strive for peace, national independence, democracy and socialism.
    Ma. Takizade, the captain of the "Shirvan Oil" oil well communist labor team, said: "Time is on our side. Now, the strength of peace and socialism exceeds the dark forces of imperialism and war, which is becoming more and more obvious. The Moscow meeting showed the strong unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties, their loyalty to Marxism-Leninism and the immortal legacy of Lenin. Truth is on our side, we will surely win. Our communist labor team has produced 12,000 tons of oil for the country ahead of schedule."
    Workers in various workshops of the Lviv Bus Factory in Ukraine held discussions. A. Ryashkevich, a fitter in the experimental workshop, said: "The statement emphasizes the rapid growth of the strength and international influence of the world socialist system. The strength of socialism is increasingly exceeding the strength of imperialism. For me, the day the statement was published has double importance: I received my probationary CPSU membership card, and I will work even better with my like-minded friends."
    Fu. Guchalo, the Party Branch Secretary of the steel frame rolling workshop, said: "The meeting statement has given each of us new strength. We will use this strength to complete the annual plan ahead of schedule and successfully prepare for the work in 1961."

    团结一致是社会主义力量胜利泉源
    本报讯　苏联劳动人民热烈支持各国共产党和工人党代表会议声明。
    在苏联首都，这个伟大的文件已成为广大人民注意的中心。当报刊上发表了这个文件后，莫斯科“红色无产者”工厂的工人都非常兴奋。在换班的休息时间，在用午饭的短短休息时间，在下工后，人们一组一组地讨论这个卓越的文件，发表自己的意见和交谈印象。
    著名生产者、社会主义劳动英雄、钳工叶尔米洛夫同志说：“这个声明令人欢欣鼓舞。它再一次确认了整个世界共产主义运动、整个社会主义阵营牢不可破的团结一致。任何人也破坏不了这一伟大的友谊。这友谊是我们强大有力的泉源，是我们一切辉煌胜利的基础。”
    在最老的生产者之一、工长伊万诺夫工作的车间里，在一班工作完毕后举行了群众集会。
    光荣的“狄纳莫”工厂各车间也对会议声明组织了阅读、讨论，并举行了短暂的群众集会。
    最老的生产者、1930年入党的苏共党员伊万·卢基亚诺夫在群众集会上发言说：“我以极大的兴趣和关心阅读了会议声明。这是我们伟大时代的伟大文件。它再一次向全世界表明，共产党和工人党、社会主义国家人民的团结一致及他们对马克思列宁主义学说的不可动摇的信心，是我们伟大的和平阵营强大有力和不可战胜的主要泉源。”
    阿塞拜疆的石油工人热烈讨论了共产党和工人党代表会议声明。石油工人一致赞同会议声明，他们认为这个声明是争取和平、民族独立、民主和社会主义的世界共产主义运动的战斗纲领。
      “什尔万石油”油井共产主义劳动队队长马·塔基扎杰说：“时间对我们有利。现在，和平与社会主义的力量超过帝国主义和战争的黑暗势力，越来越明显了。莫斯科会议显示了共产党和工人党的强大的团结一致，他们对马克思列宁主义和不朽的列宁遗教的忠诚。真理在我们这边，我们一定胜利。我们的共产主义劳动队已经超计划给国家生产了一万二千吨石油。”
    在乌克兰的里沃夫公共汽车工厂各车间的工人分别举行了座谈，实验车间的钳工阿·里亚什凯维奇说：“声明强调世界社会主义体系实力和国际影响的急剧增长。社会主义力量日益超过帝国主义力量。对于我来说，公布声明的这一天有加倍重要的意义：我领到了苏共候补党员党证，我将和思想一致的朋友们一起工作得更好。”
    钢架压延车间党组织书记弗·古查洛说：“会议声明给我们每个人增添了新的力量。我们要用这种力量提前完成年度计划，并成功地准备1961年的工作。”
