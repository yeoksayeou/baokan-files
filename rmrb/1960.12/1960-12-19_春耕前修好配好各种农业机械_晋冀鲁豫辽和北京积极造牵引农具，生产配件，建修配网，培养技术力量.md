Xinhua News Agency, 18th. Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Liaoning provinces and Beijing are actively taking measures to strengthen the supporting and maintenance of agricultural machinery to ensure that 90% of the agricultural machinery can be operated normally and used for production before the spring plowing next year.

Currently, the agricultural machinery departments of these provinces and cities are, in conjunction with the agricultural departments, formulating production plans for various tractor-drawn implements such as plows, harrows, and seeders, so that existing tractors can be equipped with more tractor-drawn implements to improve the utilization rate of tractors and enable more land to be cultivated by machinery. According to the arrangements of the agricultural machinery departments in these areas, existing tractors will be equipped with one or two tractor-drawn implements such as plows and harrows before the spring plowing next year.

Accelerating the establishment of an agricultural machinery repair and distribution network and strengthening the maintenance and repair of agricultural machinery are the main links to ensure the normal operation of machines. Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Liaoning provinces and Beijing are establishing repair factories according to the distribution of agricultural machinery and production capacity in their localities to ensure that agricultural machinery is repaired as soon as it breaks down. Fifty-one of the sixty-seven people's communes in the suburbs of Beijing have established repair factories, and each production team has a repair team, which has formed a preliminary agricultural machinery repair and distribution network, basically achieving on-the-spot repairs of transport machinery and irrigation and drainage machinery as soon as they arrive. Henan Province has adjusted and planned the province's repair points, and established 23 large-scale repair factories in six major special zones such as Kaifeng and Luoyang and Zhengzhou City, 55 medium-sized repair factories in each county, and 1,140 repair stations in the communes, so that agricultural machinery can be repaired without leaving the special zone for major repairs, without leaving the county for medium repairs, and without leaving the commune for minor repairs. The strengthening of repair forces has significantly improved the utilization rate of agricultural machinery. According to statistics, as of the beginning of November, Liaoning Province has repaired 83.4% of the various tractors that should be repaired, and 69.8% of the repaired internal combustion engines. The utilization rate of irrigation and drainage machinery in the suburbs of Beijing has increased by an average of 20%.

In order to ensure the supply of spare parts required for repairing agricultural machinery, these provinces and cities are vigorously grasping the production of agricultural machinery spare parts. In addition to the original agricultural machinery factories rushing to manufacture spare parts, the five provinces have also transferred 71 factories from the original machinery departments to the leadership of the agricultural machinery departments and converted them into specialized spare parts manufacturing factories, and included the production of spare parts in the plan, allocating special materials, and fixing the workers who produce spare parts. This practice of specialized factories, specialized materials, and specialized personnel ensures that the production of spare parts can meet the requirements of quality, quantity, and timeliness.

The agricultural machinery departments of these provinces and cities are also cooperating with relevant departments to jointly train agricultural machinery repair and distribution forces and use and storage forces. Shanxi Province has decided to adopt the following three forms for training: sending people to repair factories for internships; relying on existing mechanical schools for training; and running short-term training classes with the tractor stations in the special zones as units. Shanxi Province plans to run three training classes this winter and next spring, and the first phase has already begun. Beijing takes advantage of the opportunity of tractors being repaired in the factory to invite drivers to the factory to learn repair and distribution, so that drivers are both drivers and repairmen. The Beijing transportation department has also transferred 100 auto repairmen to some agricultural machinery repair factories to help repair tractors, internal combustion engines, and irrigation and drainage machinery, while also taking on apprentices.

While strengthening the repair and distribution of agricultural machinery, these provinces and cities also attach great importance to the repair and manufacturing of small agricultural tools. Beijing has already arranged the production of small agricultural tools and will produce one million pieces within the year. Recently, the Municipal Agricultural Machinery Bureau also invited more than 20 skilled craftsmen from five counties who manufacture small agricultural tools to hold a forum to help them summarize and improve the experience of manufacturing "brand-name" agricultural tools and improve the quality of small agricultural tools. The Henan Provincial Agricultural Machinery Bureau recently allocated 2,000 tons of edge steel and more than 19,000 tons of scrap steel, specifically for the production of 13.6 million small agricultural tools this year. Shanxi is carrying out a campaign to repair and manufacture small agricultural tools in a big way so that each worker can obtain several handy tools before spring plowing. (Picture attached)

    春耕前修好配好各种农业机械
    晋冀鲁豫辽和北京积极造牵引农具，生产配件，建修配网，培养技术力量
    新华社18日讯　山西、河北、山东、河南、辽宁五省和北京市积极采取措施，加强农业机械的配套和维修工作，保证在明年春耕以前有90％的农业机械能够正常开动，用于生产。
    目前，这些省市的农业机械部门正会同农业部门，制定犁、耙、播种机等多种拖拉机牵引农具的生产计划，以便使现有拖拉机多配一些牵引农具，提高拖拉机的利用率，使更多土地实现机耕。根据这些地区农业机械部门的安排，到明年春耕以前，现有拖拉机都能配上一件到两件的犁、耙等牵引农具。
    加紧建立农业机械修配网和加强对农业机械的维护检修工作，是保证机器正常开动的主要环节。山西、河北、山东、河南、辽宁五省和北京市都在根据当地农业机械分布情况、生产能力，建立修配厂，以保证农业机械随坏随修。北京市郊区六十七个人民公社，有五十一个公社建立了修配厂，每个生产队都有修配小组，已经形成一个初具规模的农业机械修配网，基本上做到运输机械、排灌机械随到随修和就地修理。河南省将全省的修配点作了调整和规划，以开封、洛阳等六大专区和郑州市划片设立了二十三个大型修配厂，在各县设立了五十五个中型修配厂，在公社设立一千一百四十个修配站，这样就可以做到农业机械大修不出专区、中修不出县、小修不出社。修配力量的加强，使农业机械利用率有显著提高。据统计，辽宁省至11月上旬止，已经修好各种拖拉机占应修量的83.4％；修好的内燃机占应修量的69.8％。北京市郊区排灌机械利用率平均提高20％。
    为保证修配农业机械所需配件的供应，这些省市正在狠抓农业机械配件的生产。除原有农业机械厂赶制配件以外，五个省份还从原来机械部门划出七十一个工厂归农业机械部门领导，改为专业配件制造厂，并把配件生产列入计划，拨给专用材料，把生产配件的工人也固定下来。这种专厂专材专人的做法，使配件生产能够做到保质、保量、保时的要求。
    这些省市农业机械部门还同有关部门协作，共同培养训练农业机械修配力量和使用保管力量。山西省决定采取以下三种形式进行训练：派人到修配厂实习；依靠现有机械学校培养；以专区拖拉机站为单位开办短期训练班。今冬明春山西省准备开办三期训练班，目前第一期已经开始。北京市利用拖拉机进厂修理的机会，请司机也进厂，学习修配，使司机既是驾驶员又是修理工。北京市交通部门还下放一百名汽车修理工到一些农机修配厂去帮助修配拖拉机、内燃机、排灌机械，同时带徒弟。
    在加强农业机械修配工作的同时，这些省市对小农具的修制工作也十分重视。北京市已经安排了小农具的生产，年内将生产出一百万件。最近市农机局还邀请五个县的二十多位制造小农具的能工巧匠开了座谈会，帮助他们总结和提高制造“名牌”农具经验，提高小农具质量。河南省农机局最近拨二千吨刃钢、一万九千多吨废钢，专门供年内生产一千三百六十万件小农具使用。山西正在开展大修大造小农具运动，以便在春耕前使每个劳动力都能得到几件得心应手的工具。（附图片）
