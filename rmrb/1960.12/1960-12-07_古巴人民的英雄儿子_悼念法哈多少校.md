The heroic son of the Cuban people
—In memory of Major Fajardo
Wu Tong

Early in the morning of the 3rd, I was shocked to see in the newspaper that Cuban militia leader Major Manuel Fajardo had heroically sacrificed himself in a battle to pursue counter-revolutionary elements in the Sierra Maestra mountains. It was hard to believe that just half a year ago, Major Fajardo had warmly expressed to Chen Zhongjing, the head of the art troupe, his hope to visit China soon. At that time, Comrade Chen Zhongjing expressed a warm welcome.

We first met Major Fajardo one night not long after our arrival in Cuba. In Havana, it was already past two in the morning when Major Fajardo, along with Raúl Castro, the Minister of the Revolutionary Government Armed Forces of Cuba, came to the hotel to visit the leading comrades of the art troupe. Minister Raúl Castro specifically explained that because we were going to visit the Sierra Maestra mountains, the revolutionary base of Cuba, he had specifically brought Major Fajardo, who was responsible for the work in the mountainous area, to introduce to us.

The first impression of Fajardo was: enthusiastic and determined. He didn't say much during the first meeting, but he quickly expressed his love for China, and he expressed to the leading comrades of the art troupe that he eagerly hoped to visit China.

A thin man, his skin looked a little dark, tall, with dark, slightly curly hair, and a Cuban rebel-style beard, a typical Cuban appearance; he was warm, humble, and friendly, but also showed firmness and strength; on the surface, people would feel that his physique was not quite like a soldier, but he was wearing the uniform of a rebel major and was also a strong and brave rebel fighter.

Major Fajardo and his old comrade-in-arms, Major Armando Acosta, who was in charge of military command in the mountainous area, greeted and entertained us warmly in the noble manner of the rebel army and the friendly manner of the Chinese. In the city of Cienfuegos, they built a Chinese-style archway and hung Chinese-style lanterns and colorful flowers made by the rebel army to express their cordial welcome to us. We stayed in the mountainous area for more than a day, and the two majors accompanied us throughout the visit.

Facing the overlapping mountains surrounding us, Major Fajardo told the story of the arduous struggle of the rebel soldiers in those years. He spoke so humbly, optimistically, and boldly, displaying the ambition of the Cuban people to resist the Batista dictatorship.

He said: "The Cuban revolution started with mountain warfare, which is somewhat similar to the Chinese revolution, and the laws of development are also similar." From what he said, we remembered something an rebel captain told us: in Cuba, many people often talked about how, during the difficult years of the Cuban armed struggle, Chairman Mao Zedong's book on guerrilla warfare gave the Cuban people a great deal of help, and people called Chairman Mao Zedong's book "Chinese Grain." The Cuban people always talked about the relationship between the Cuban revolution and the Chinese revolution in such a kind and friendly way. Major Fajardo mentioned again: "I hope to go to China soon, and we should strengthen the ties between Cuba and China."

Then, he told us that after the victory in the war against the dictatorship, the American imperialists had never relaxed their sabotage conspiracy against this desolate mountainous area. In this place, which had been brutally ravaged by Batista and liberated after arduous fighting, American planes had bombed the former command post of Minister Raúl Castro and Commander Guevara more than once. But the destroyed houses were quickly rebuilt by the rebel soldiers.

"Even if the Americans drop an atomic bomb, we are not afraid." Major Fajardo said so decisively, expressing the firm will and heroic spirit of the Cuban people. He went on to say: "Now we have started peaceful labor in the mountainous area, but we also have military training schools here." Today in Cuba, whether adults or children, everyone knows that American imperialism is intensifying its aggression against them; they realize that the enemy still exists, the United States still occupies the Guantanamo Naval Base, the Cuban people cannot lay down their weapons, and cannot relax their vigilance in the slightest. That's what one rebel soldier told us.

Major Fajardo also spoke kindly about the rich resources of the beautiful mountainous area, which produces coffee and coconuts, and also has rich mineral deposits. The revolutionary government wants to develop the mountainous area, and the first "school city" has already begun to be built in the mountainous area.

Finally, he did not forget to introduce the heroic deeds of his comrade-in-arms, Major Acosta.

"But he forgot to introduce himself," Major Acosta said with a humorous laugh, as if revealing a secret.

Before the victory of the revolution, Major Fajardo was a famous surgeon, and he donated a considerable portion of his income from medical practice to the revolutionary cause. He himself also joined the ranks of the battle, fighting in the Sierra Maestra mountains. He is an old comrade-in-arms of Premier Castro, and to this day, he is often Premier Castro's personal doctor. After the victory of the revolution, he mainly took charge of the leadership work of building ten school cities nationwide. Currently, he is leading the construction work in the first school city named after the heroic name of the martyr of Cienfuegos. He is carrying out the arduous and great task of the revolutionary government to cultivate the next generation.

The last time we saw Major Fajardo was after the Chinese art troupe returned to Havana from its tour of the Cuban provinces. At that time, Premier Castro was ill, and he was recalled to take care of Premier Castro's health. The Chinese art troupe wrote a letter to greet Premier Castro, sincerely wishing the Premier a speedy recovery. Major Fajardo, on behalf of Premier Castro, brought the Premier's autograph letter to the hotel to thank the art troupe for its deep friendship. He said that Fidel Castro thanked the art troupe for its concern for him; at the same time, he thanked the entire art troupe for joining the Cuban people in the million-person rally protesting American imperialist aggression and for the Chinese people's support for the Cuban revolution. At that time, although Premier Castro was unable to attend this grand gathering due to illness, the entire Cuban people were concerned about the health of their leader and wanted to hear his heroic voice of steel. Finally, under the care of Dr. Fajardo, Premier Castro delivered a television speech from his sickbed, resolutely counterattacking the shameless provocation of American imperialism and crushing the American conspiracy to strangle the Cuban revolution by refusing to refine Cuban crude oil purchased from the Soviet Union after limiting the amount of Cuban sugar purchased.

During this meeting, he still did not forget to express his regret to the art troupe for the third time for not being able to go to China soon, but "I must go to China soon, and I hope to see you again in Beijing." Unexpectedly, this was our last meeting with him, Major Fajardo could no longer accept our welcome to Beijing, but his love for the Chinese people came to Beijing, and his kind image is forever imprinted in our hearts.

Major Fajardo heroically sacrificed himself. He died in the place where he and his comrades had fought arduously against the Batista dictatorship, he died in the place where he was engaged in peaceful construction for his motherland, he died under the bullets of American imperialism's aggression against Cuba, he died on the post of defending his sacred motherland and free land, he died in the Cuban people's heroic struggle against American imperialism.

We deeply mourn Major Fajardo together with the Cuban people, and we also feel honored and proud together with the Cuban people to have such a brave son.

When one person falls, thousands of people stand up. The Cuban people's revolutionary struggle is surging forward, American imperialism has reached the end of its rope, and it is imperialism and all reactionaries that will die.

Eternal glory to the heroic sons of the Cuban people who sacrificed themselves in the heroic struggle for the independence, freedom and happiness of the motherland.

Rest in peace, warrior. (Attached picture)

    古巴人民的英雄儿子
    ——悼念法哈多少校
    吴佟
    3日一清早，从报纸上看到古巴的民兵领袖曼努埃尔·法哈多少校在马埃斯特腊山区追捕反革命分子的战斗中英勇牺牲的消息，不胜震惊。简直不能相信，就在半年以前，法哈多少校还曾对艺术团的团长陈忠经同志热情地表示他希望能很快就到中国来访问。当时陈忠经同志曾表示了热诚的欢迎。
    我们第一次见到法哈多少校，是在我们刚到古巴不久的一个夜晚。在哈瓦那，已经是深夜两点多钟了，就在我们住宿的旅馆里，法哈多少校随着古巴革命政府武装部长劳尔·卡斯特罗到旅馆来拜访艺术团的领导同志。当时劳尔·卡斯特罗部长特别解释，因为我们将要去访问古巴革命根据地马埃斯特腊山区，他特带来负责山区工作的法哈多少校介绍给我们认识。
    法哈多给人第一个印象是：热情、坚毅。第一次见面他没有说很多话，但是他却很快地表达了他热爱中国的感情，他对艺术团的领导同志表示，他热切期望能到中国去访问。
    一个清瘦的人，皮肤显得有些黝黑，高高的个子，黑黑的头发略带卷曲，留着古巴起义军式的胡子，典型的古巴人的模样；为人热情、谦虚、和气，但又表现得坚毅有力；从表面上看，人们会觉得他的体质有些不像个军人，但是他穿着起义军少校的制服，而且还是一个坚强勇敢的起义军战士。
    法哈多少校和他的老战友、负责山区军事指挥工作的阿曼多·阿科斯大少校，以崇高的起义军的方式和友好的中国的方式，热情地迎接和招待了我们。就在西恩富戈斯城，他们搭了一个中国式的牌坊，挂着由起义军赶制的中国式的灯笼和彩花，用来表示对我们的亲切的欢迎。我们在山区停留了一天多，两位少校一直陪伴着我们进行参观访问。
    法哈多少校对着围绕着我们的重重层叠的山峦，讲起当年起义军战士们艰苦斗争的故事。他讲得那么谦虚、乐观，而又豪放地显示了古巴人民反抗巴蒂斯塔独裁统治的雄心壮志。
    他说：“古巴的革命从山地作战开始，与中国的革命有些相似，发展的规律也差不多。”从他讲的话，我们记起一位起义军上尉告诉我们的一件事：古巴常有许多人谈论着，在古巴武装斗争的艰苦岁月里，毛泽东主席论游击战争的书籍给古巴人民很大的帮助，人们都称毛泽东主席的书为“中国粮食”。古巴人民总是这样亲切友好地谈到古巴的革命和中国革命的关系。法哈多少校又一次提到：“希望能很快就到中国去，应该增强古巴和中国两国间的联系。”
    接着，他告诉我们，就在反对独裁战争胜利以后，美帝国主义者从来没有放松对这荒野的山地的破坏阴谋。就在这块曾经遭受巴蒂斯塔残酷蹂躏、经过艰苦奋战获得解放的地方，美国飞机不止一次轰炸过昔日劳尔·卡斯特罗部长和格瓦拉行长的指挥部。但是被炸毁的房子，很快又被起义军战士修建起来了。
    “美国佬就是扔下原子弹，我们也不害怕。”法哈多少校那样斩钉截铁地说出古巴人民的坚强意志和英雄气魄。他接着说：“现在我们山区已经开始和平劳动了，但是就在这里我们也还有军事训练学校。”今天在古巴无论大人或小孩都知道，美帝国主义在加紧侵略他们；他们认识到：敌人还存在，美国还占领着关塔那摩海军基地，古巴人民不能放下武器，也丝毫不能放松警惕。一个起义军战士就是这样告诉我们的。
    法哈多少校还亲切地谈到美丽的山区的丰富资源，这是出咖啡、椰子的地方，还有丰富的矿藏，革命政府要开发山区，第一座“学校城”已经开始在山区建立起来了。
    最后，他没有忘记介绍他的战友阿科斯大少校的英勇作战的事迹。
    “但是，他却忘记了介绍他自己。”阿科斯大少校诙谐地笑着说，像在揭穿什么秘密似的。
    法哈多少校在革命胜利前原是一位著名的外科医生，他把行医所得的相当大一笔收入，全部捐献给革命事业了。他本人也投入了战斗的行列，转战在马埃斯特腊山区。他是卡斯特罗总理的老战友，至今，他常常还是卡斯特罗总理的私人医生。革命胜利后，他主要担负着全国建设十个学校城的领导工作。目前他在这个以西恩富戈斯先烈的英雄名字命名的第一个学校城领导建设工作。他在执行着革命政府培育下一代的艰巨而伟大的任务。
    我们最后一次见到法哈多少校，是中国艺术团在古巴各省巡回演出回到哈瓦那以后。那个时候卡斯特罗总理病了，他又被召回来负责照顾卡斯特罗总理的健康。中国艺术团写了一封信问候卡斯特罗总理，热诚地祝总理早日恢复健康。法哈多少校代表卡斯特罗总理拿着总理的亲笔信到旅馆来答谢艺术团的深厚情谊。他说，菲德尔总理感谢艺术团对他的关心；同时，感谢艺术团全体与古巴人民一起参加了抗议美帝国主义侵略的百万人大会和中国人民对古巴革命的支持。那时，卡斯特罗总理虽然因病没有参加这个盛大的集会，但是全古巴人民关心着他们的领导人的健康，想倾听他的英雄的钢铁的声音。终于在法哈多大夫的照顾下，卡斯特罗总理靠着病床发表了电视演说，坚决反击了美帝国主义的无耻挑衅，粉碎了美国继通过限购古巴糖额之后又想以不炼古巴购自苏联的原油来扼杀古巴革命的阴谋。
    在这次会见中，他仍然没有忘记第三次向艺术团提出：因为没有能很快到中国去表示遗憾，然而“我一定要在不久就到中国去，希望在北京再见”。没有想到，这次竟是我们和他的最后一次会见，法哈多少校再不能接受我们的欢迎到北京来了，但是，他的热爱中国人民的心来到了北京了，他的亲切的形象永远烙印在我们的心中。
    法哈多少校英勇牺牲了，他死在他曾和他的战友们为坚决反对巴蒂斯塔独裁统治进行艰苦战斗的地方，他死在今天他正从事为他的祖国进行着和平建设的地方，他死在美帝国主义的侵略古巴的枪弹下，他死在保卫自己神圣的祖国和自由的土地的岗位上，他死在古巴人民坚决反对美国帝国主义的英雄斗争事业中。
    我们和古巴人民一起深深悼念法哈多少校，我们也和古巴人民一起为古巴人民有这样英勇的儿子感到光荣和骄傲。
    一个人倒下去，千万人站起来。古巴人民的革命斗争正汹涌澎湃地前进，美帝国主义已走向穷途末路，死亡的将是帝国主义和一切反动派。
    在为祖国的独立、自由和幸福的英勇战斗中牺牲的英雄的古巴人民的儿子永垂不朽。
    战士，安息吧。（附图片）
