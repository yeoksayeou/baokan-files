    Rational Organization of Labor
    Zhang Wanlaikuan, Party Branch Secretary of Xiufeng Management Area, Doucun Commune, Wutai County, Shanxi

    Fixing labor is an old saying, and it seems like it's not worth bothering with now. But in reality, it is still a very important issue at present. We have been engaged in fixing labor for eight years, suffered from this, and the lessons learned are: without fixing labor, there is no responsibility system, and the policy of taking grain as the key link and promoting all-round development cannot be better implemented.

    Since the beginning of setting up agricultural cooperatives in 1953, we have fixed labor to production teams for unified allocation and use by the teams. However, at that time, we only managed agriculture, and fixing labor was relatively simple. After the realization of the commune system, various economies were fully developed, the battle lines were lengthened, and we should have carried out labor fixing more comprehensively and meticulously; but we did not do so, and as a result, the original labor order was disrupted. Because the labor force was not fixed, the production responsibility system and the "three guarantees and one reward" system could not be implemented. We have the deepest understanding of this lesson. Therefore, in 1959, we comprehensively and meticulously fixed labor, ensuring the continuous great leap forward in various productions.

    After the realization of the people's commune system, fixing labor must adapt to the three-level ownership system based on production teams, the policy of basing on agriculture, and the characteristics of the commune's wide business scope. Our main experiences are as follows:

    First, fixed labor should be matched and integrated. Whether it is agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, or sideline occupations, the fixed labor should be matched and integrated to form a team. To make the fixed labor matched and integrated, first of all, the labor must be adapted to the draft animals and farm implements. For example, to serve a pair of livestock, you must equip it with two full-fledged handlers who can operate the plow and sow, as well as several assistants, to give full play to its role. Last year, the third team lacked three experienced workers, and there was a phenomenon of the cattle pair stopping work. Now, our entire management area has four production teams, four pairs of livestock, and eight experienced workers, which are truly well-matched, and people, animals, and tools can play their roles well. Secondly, within a unit, there should be old, strong, and weak people to make reasonable use of labor. This is the case in agriculture, and it is also the case in sideline occupations. The lime kiln has five people, two elderly people watch the fire, two strong people carry stones, and one young person does odd jobs, which achieves "everyone doing their best." Finally, the fixed labor should be adapted to the workload to ensure the smooth completion of production tasks.

    Second, the combination of industry-specific fixation and seasonal fixation. In the advanced cooperatives, we only had the fixation of agricultural labor, but not the fixation of other industries. Therefore, the commune members only valued agriculture and neglected others. The labor force in sideline occupations and animal husbandry was not fixed, and they often "argued" with agriculture. This contradiction became even more prominent after the realization of the people's commune system. Therefore, we also fixed labor in forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and basic construction in proportion. After the industry-specific fixation, the responsibility system for various industries was strengthened. However, since the focus of production varies from quarter to quarter, dead fixation cannot adapt to live situations. At critical moments, the phenomenon of various industries "fighting" each other for labor still occurs. Therefore, on the basis of industry-specific fixed labor, we further developed a system that combines industry-specific fixation and seasonal fixation. However, the so-called seasonal fixation mainly fixes labor reasonably and flexibly based on the production situation in the two major periods of busy season and slack season. For example, in the busy farming season, the fixed labor in agriculture should account for 80% of the total labor force, and other forestry, sideline occupations, and collective welfare undertakings should be less; in the slack farming season, the fixed labor in agriculture should be reduced, and other aspects should be increased. As a result of industry-specific and seasonal fixed labor, grain production can be given priority, and the all-round development of various productions can be promoted.

    Third, the combination of single-industry fixation and dual-industry fixation. After the labor force is fixed by industry and season, it is not enough to have single-industry fixation. There must also be combined-industry fixation, which means that one person is engaged in two industries. This method was developed from practical experience. For example, if those engaged in forestry are completely separated from agriculture, it will appear that those engaged in agriculture are very busy during the busy farming season, while those engaged in forestry are leisurely. In response to this situation, we adopted the method of "double fixation," linking the labor force in forestry, basic construction, and animal husbandry with agriculture, jointly undertaking contract production tasks, and when implementing rewards and punishments, they are rewarded and compensated according to the percentage of their actual participation in agricultural labor to their total annual labor days. This reasonably tapped the potential of labor and increased the strength of agricultural production.

    After the labor force is fixed, the key is to persist. We have delegated some productions that do not need to be managed by the management area to the production teams. Each team arranges its own labor and time to actively complete it; the management area issues work points according to the actual completion situation and in accordance with the contract quota.

    合理组织劳动力
    山西五台县豆村公社秀峰管理区党支部书记  张万来宽
    劳力固定使用，听起来是句老话，好像现在不值得为它劳神了。其实不然，这在当前仍然是个十分重要的问题。我们搞劳力固定已经八年，吃过这个苦头，得出的经验教训是：没有劳力固定就没有责任制，就不能更好地保证以粮为纲、全面发展的方针贯彻执行。
    我们从1953年初办农业社起，就把劳力固定到生产队使用，由队统一调配、统一使用。不过，当时只经营农业，固定劳力比较简单。实现公社化以后，各种经济全面发展了，战线拉长了，本来应该更全面更细致地进行劳力固定；可是我们没有这样做，结果闹乱了原来的劳动秩序。因为劳力不固定，什么生产责任制、“三包一奖”制也就办不到。这一教训，我们感受最深。于是在1959年，我们就全面地细致地进行了劳力固定，保证了各项生产的持续大跃进。
    搞劳力固定，在人民公社化以后，必须适应以生产队为基础的三级所有制和以农业为基础的方针，以及公社经营范围广等特点。我们的主要经验有以下几点：
    第一，固定劳力要配套成龙。不论农业，或者林、牧、副业，固定的劳力都要配套成龙，组成一个班子。要使固定劳力配套成龙，首先必须使劳力和耕畜、农具相适应。如服务于一犋牲口，你就得配上能掌犁和摇耧的两个全把手及几个辅助手，才能充分发挥作用。前年，第三队缺少三把老手，就发生过牛犋停工的现象。现在，我们全管区四个生产队，有四犋牲口，八把老手，真正配了套，人、畜、工具就能很好地发挥作用了。其次，在一个单位内，老、壮、强、弱都应有，才能合理利用劳力。搞农业是如此，搞副业也是如此。石灰窑有五个人，两个老年看火候，两个壮年担石头，一个少年打杂活，这就作到了“人尽其力”。再次，劳力固定和工作量要相适应，才能保证生产任务顺利完成。
    第二，分业固定和分季固定相结合。高级社时，我们只有农业劳力的固定，没有其他各业的固定。因之，社员只重视农业、忽视其他。副业和畜牧业劳力不固定，也经常和农业上“扯皮”。这一矛盾，在实现人民公社化以后，更显的突出了。于是，我们在林、牧、副业和基本建设上也按比例固定了劳力。分业固定以后，各业生产的责任制加强了。但是，由于各个季度生产重点不同，死固定不能适应活情况，在紧要关头，仍会出现各业劳力相互
  “打架”的现象。因此，我们又在分业固定劳力的基础上，进一步发展为分业固定和分季固定相结合的制度。不过，所谓分季固定，主要是根据忙季和闲季这两大段的生产情况，合理地而又是灵活地固定劳力。比如在农忙季节，农业上固定的劳力要占劳力总数的80％，其它林业、副业和集体福利事业等就要少一些；在农闲季节，农业上固定的劳力就减少些，其它方面就加大些。分业分季固定劳力的结果，既能优先发展粮食生产，又能促进各项生产全面发展。
    第三，单业固定和双业固定相结合。劳力实行分业分季固定以后，光有单业固定不行，还必须有兼业固定，也就是一身兼二业。这一办法，是从实践过程中摸出的。比如，搞林业的，完全脱离农业，就会出现农忙时搞农业的忙的不可开交，搞林业的却消消闲闲。针对这种情况，我们采取“双固定”的办法，把林业、基建、畜牧上的劳力，都和农业挂起钩来，共同担负包产任务，执行奖惩时，按照本人实际参加农业劳动所占本人全年总劳动日的成数，按成享受奖励和摊赔。这就合理地挖掘了劳动潜力，增加了农业生产的力量。
    劳力固定以后，关键在于坚持。我们对有些不需要由管理区经营的生产，都下放到生产队。由各队自己安排劳力，安排时间，主动完成；管理区根据实际完成情况，按照包工定额，发给工分。
