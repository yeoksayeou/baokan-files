Promoting National Economic Development on the Basis of Agriculture
Zhang Desheng, First Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

Grain First, Increase Grain Production by Every Possible Means

Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and grain is the foundation of the foundation. Over the years, especially in recent years, we have increasingly realized that the rapid development of agriculture is the central link in the high-speed and proportionate development of the national economy. People need to eat every day. Whether it is running industry, transportation, education, basic construction, or any other undertaking, it is inseparable from grain. The development of various undertakings depends first and foremost on how much commodity grain and labor agriculture provides to society; only with the rapid development of agriculture can there be a rapid development of the entire national economy. In the past few years, the achievements on the agricultural front in Shaanxi Province have been unprecedentedly great. Especially since 1958, we have experienced two years of continuous drought out of three. We not only overcame the severe disasters that had not occurred for many years, but also won the continuous leap forward in agricultural production, which promoted the comprehensive leap forward in the entire national economy. At the same time, in the struggle against drought, farmland capital construction centered on water conservancy has been greatly developed, enhancing the ability to resist natural disasters. However, it must be seen that the current level of agricultural production is still very low, and continuous natural disasters in the past two years have caused certain difficulties for the development of agricultural production; while the development of the national economy and the improvement of people's living standards have an increasingly high demand for agriculture. This is a contradiction. The primary task of the entire Party and the entire people for a considerable period is to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production. Grain first, we must increase grain production by every possible means.

In order to strive for a bumper harvest of grain and other crops, in terms of agricultural production, we must implement the policy of both multiple cropping for more yield and high yield for more yield. At present, special attention should be paid to multiple cropping for more yield. Multiple cropping is the foundation of more yield. In order to have multiple cropping, we must not only strictly control the land used for basic construction and pay great attention to saving land, but also actively and systematically reclaim all possible wasteland and transform riveræ»©land, and make full use of idle land and small scattered plots of land, to expand the cultivated area as much as possible. At the same time, we must actively create conditions to gradually and appropriately increase the multiple cropping index and expand the sown area. How much to re-crop mainly depends on the conditions such as water, fertilizer, labor, and livestock, and should be determined according to local conditions.

High yield for more yield is the basic way to increase agricultural production. At present, in Shaanxi Province, there are not many high-yield areas, but there are many low-yield areas. We must not only focus on large-area high-yield and general field crops, but also focus on transforming low-yield fields, so that high-yield fields become even higher-yield, and low-yield fields become high-yield. For the transformation of low-yield fields, on the one hand, high-yield crops should be planted, and high-yield varieties suitable for the local area should be selected, and field management should be strengthened; on the other hand, the soil should be fundamentally improved. The soil of low-yield fields can be completely transformed, the problem is to have a revolutionary drive to transform nature and practical measures. Some places in the Yan'an and Yulin prefectures, on the basis of mountain management, water management, and sand control, are vigorously engaged in high-yield mountains and high-yield gullies, combining mountain management, water management measures, and other various measures closely together, transforming one mountain and one gully in a concentrated and comprehensive manner. These practices are very good and should be promoted.

The experience of the past few years has repeatedly proven that on the basis of fully implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, we must prominently focus on water conservancy and fertilizer. No matter what region or what soil, as long as water conservancy and fertilizer are improved, yields can be greatly increased. To overcome drought, relying solely on surface water is not enough, we must combine storage, diversion, and lifting, and use all three waters (sky water, surface water, and groundwater). Some of the existing water conservancy projects in Shaanxi Province are not yet complete and cannot benefit, and the guarantee rate of those that can benefit is not high. If there is a prolonged drought and the river water dries up, the area that can be guaranteed for irrigation will be even smaller. Therefore, while extensively using surface water, we must also advance towards groundwater. To fundamentally change the face of drought, we must also vigorously carry out soil and water conservation, combine mountain management, water management, and sand control, and plant trees and forests on a large scale in a planned manner, while protecting the existing forests. However, the scale and speed of water conservancy and other farmland capital construction should be arranged under the condition of guaranteeing the labor force needed for the current year's production, and efforts should be concentrated to ensure key points. This winter and next spring, we must concentrate our efforts to first carry out supporting projects and finishing projects that can be effective in the current year. In places where the main projects have been completed or are about to be completed, we must open canals, level land, and give full play to irrigation benefits as soon as possible. For a large increase in grain production, there must be both a large development of water conservancy and a large increase in fertilizer. The current problem of insufficient fertilizer is very prominent. We must implement the policy of simultaneously emphasizing both farm manure and chemical fertilizers. To focus on fertilizer, we must first focus on farm manure, vigorously engage in pig and sheep raising to accumulate manure, plant and compost green manure on a large scale, and accumulate more manure and accumulate good manure. We must combine regular manure accumulation with crash manure accumulation, and combine collective manure accumulation with individual manure accumulation by commune members. At the same time, we must actively build chemical fertilizer plants. The "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture is closely linked, mutually promoting, and indispensable. Therefore, while focusing on water conservancy and fertilizer, we must also focus on other measures and do so in a manner appropriate to local conditions and without violating the farming season.

Without a developed animal husbandry, the development of agriculture will be greatly affected. The development of animal husbandry should focus on pigs, cattle, and sheep. To develop pig raising, we must implement the policy of simultaneously emphasizing public raising and private raising. Public raising should emphasize both large collectives and small collectives, with production teams and public canteens as the main ones. Private pig raising by commune members should also be encouraged and supported. Before the realization of mechanized farming, cattle are the basic power for agricultural production. After the realization of mechanized farming, cattle are still indispensable. Special attention should be paid to development, the experience of combining raising and use should be actively promoted, and the feeding and service systems should be effectively improved, and the feed problem for livestock should be effectively solved. In addition to fully collecting wild feed, land that can be used should be used to establish feed bases. Pig farms and pastures run by counties and communes should advocate the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry, using agriculture to support animal husbandry, using fertilizer to nourish fields, and diversifying operations for comprehensive development.

Guarantee the Necessary Labor Force for Agriculture and Actively Carry Out Technical Transformation of Agriculture

In order to change the backward state of agricultural production, the labor force on the agricultural front must be strengthened. People are the decisive factor in productivity. Especially since the technical transformation of agriculture has just begun, and the technical level of agriculture is still very low, under such circumstances, guaranteeing the necessary labor force for the front line of agricultural production has become the central key to increasing grain production at present. The rural labor force (including full labor, half labor, excluding auxiliary labor) should reach more than 40% of the total rural population, of which full labor accounts for two-thirds. Taking the total number of full and half rural labor as 100, the labor force occupied by the commune and production team levels should not exceed 5%, and the remaining 95% should be at the disposal of the production team. Wasting labor is the greatest waste, and saving labor is the greatest saving. A mass movement that advocates saving labor and opposes wasting labor must be launched. At the same time, counties, communes, and production teams should make overall arrangements and use the rural labor force reasonably. During the busy farming season, ensure that at least 80% or more of the rural labor force participates in field production. In addition to comprehensive arrangements throughout the year, short-term and clever arrangements should be made for each agricultural activity, and timely adjustments should be made to balance, in order to concentrate superior forces to solve the most pressing problems in current agricultural production. While ensuring grain production, the labor force necessary for forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery should also be reasonably arranged, and labor management should be strengthened and labor organization improved.

Industrial, commercial, cultural, and educational departments should also save all possible labor to support the front line of agricultural production. Of course, industry must develop and must have a certain labor force, but in order to ensure increased grain production, in the next few years, the labor force required for the development of industry must not be transferred from the countryside as much as possible, but must rely on carrying out technological revolution to free up the labor force. In the coming period, the technical revolution movement should still focus on reducing heavy manual labor and increasing raw materials, continue to realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading, transportation, mining, and road construction, and vigorously develop automated and semi-automated production to improve labor productivity.

The fundamental way to solve the shortage of agricultural labor is to actively carry out the technical transformation of agriculture. In the next two or three years, we must continue to carry out the mass movement of agricultural technical transformation with the improvement of tools as the main focus, and prioritize the use of improved tools for agricultural work that occupies the most labor, is the heaviest manual labor, and is the most seasonal. Build hydropower stations on a large scale, and develop power stations as much as possible. Vigorously train technicians who master agricultural machinery, strengthen the equipment maintenance capacity of agricultural machinery, and accumulate experience in the operation and management of agricultural machinery, and actively prepare for the realization of mechanized farming.

The industrial sector must take supporting agriculture as its primary task. This is the starting point for formulating industrial plans at the present time. The current issue of supporting agriculture is, first of all, to produce more and better steel. In order to produce more steel, small blast furnaces that have already been built should be technically transformed in a planned manner, and the output and quality of small blast furnaces should be continuously improved. At the same time, actively strengthen mine construction and strengthen coal mining, especially paying close attention to strengthening the mining of coal that is easy to transport. Another important aspect of supporting agriculture is to increase the manufacturing and repair of agricultural machinery and tools, and increase the production of chemical fertilizers. Speed up the construction of all agricultural machinery factories and chemical fertilizer factories that have started construction and are under preparation, and strive to put them into production ahead of schedule. The spare parts and components for manufacturing agricultural machinery and the materials for repairing agricultural tools and producing chemical fertilizers must be given priority guarantee. The materials allocated for manufacturing agricultural machinery, repairing agricultural tools, and producing chemical fertilizers must not be misappropriated. Industrial departments should not only provide more products for the development of agriculture, but also mobilize a large number of technical personnel to support the technical transformation of agriculture. The machinery industry in prefectures and counties undertakes the front-line tasks in the technical transformation of agriculture and must serve agricultural production with all its strength. Commune-run industries must be actively rectified and improved. The focus of rural commune-run industries should be on the repair and fitting of agricultural machinery and tools, and the production of fertilizers and pesticides.

Adhere to the Three-Level Ownership System with the Team as the Foundation and Further Consolidate the Rural People's Communes

The transformation of advanced agricultural production cooperatives into people's communes is a major change in the relations of production. After this change, China's rural socialist relations of production have become more adapted to the development of social productive forces. Three years of practice have proven that the people's commune is indeed the best social organization form to promote the high-speed development of the national economy. The people's communes have played an unparalleled power in overcoming the two consecutive years of severe disasters, not only promoting the leap forward in agricultural production, but also promoting the leap forward in the entire national economy. In order to run all rural people's communes better and build the socialist cause in the vast countryside faster and better, we should well sum up the rich experience accumulated by the people's communes in the past three years, further fully implement the Party Central Committee's policies on the people's communes, adjust the rural socialist relations of production, adhere to the three-level ownership system with the production team as the foundation, adhere to the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work," improve the relationship between people, further consolidate the people's communes, and promote the development of agricultural production.

Ownership is the determining link in the relations of production. The Party Central Committee's series of resolutions and instructions on the people's communes clearly pointed out the socialist nature of the rural people's communes at the current stage, and clearly stipulated that at the current stage, the means of production of the communes should implement the three-level ownership system, with the ownership at the production team level being basic, the ownership at the commune level being partial, and the production team should also have a small part of the ownership. The three-level ownership system with the production team as the foundation is suitable for the nature of the current rural productive forces in China, is adapted to the current development of rural productive forces in China, and must be stabilized for a long period.

The production team is the foundation of the people's commune. Strengthening the basic ownership of the production team is the key to developing the production of the people's commune and further consolidating the people's commune at the current stage. The basic ownership of the production team should be maintained and strengthened from both aspects, that is, from the commune aspect and the production team aspect. Of course, while we emphasize strengthening the basic ownership of the team, we must never ignore the development of the commune-owned economy. The commune-owned economy represents the great hope and great future of the people's commune, and the commune-owned economy should be developed while actively developing the team-owned economy. However, the development of the commune-owned economy should mainly rely on the income of commune-run enterprises, state investment and loans, and a certain proportion of the accumulation fund extracted from the production team in accordance with regulations, and must never take measures to weaken the team-owned economy. The power to manage production should be mainly held by the production team. The production plan of the commune should be based on the production plan of the production team and the production plan of the production team. The arrangement of crops, output targets, and technical measures should be discussed by the members and jointly formulated by the production team and the production team. The commune has the right to make necessary balances and adjustments according to the state plan, and conduct supervision and inspection, but it cannot disregard the actual situation, disregard the opinions of the production team, the production team, and the members, arbitrarily increase output targets, mechanically arrange crop areas, and forcibly promote technical measures. Necessary production collaborations between teams and between communes must be done through democratic consultation and must be strictly in accordance with the principle of equivalent exchange. Effectively acknowledging the small part of the ownership of the production team is an important aspect of adhering to the three-level ownership system with the team as the foundation. Land, labor, draft animals, and farm tools fixed for use by the production team must be registered and recorded, and no one may call them at will. The collaboration of labor and animal power between teams must also implement equivalent exchange. Bumper production should be based on the team. Quotas should truly leave room for maneuver, so that the team has surplus to exceed after efforts. The team economy, within the prescribed scope, should be allowed to develop appropriately and should not be harmed. In addition, commune members should also be encouraged and supported to raise pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, and engage in other household sideline occupations, and to cultivate their private plots well, provided that the collective labor is not affected.

Doing a good job in the income distribution of the people's commune is not only a major matter directly related to the people's food and clothing, but also an important condition for the further consolidation of the people's commune and the continuous leap forward in production. It is absolutely impossible to only grasp production and not grasp distribution. On the basis of production development and increased income, increasing the income of commune members year by year is the basic requirement for doing a good job in distribution. Efforts must be made from all aspects to achieve this requirement. The relationship between accumulation and consumption should be handled correctly in accordance with the principle that it is both conducive to the development of production and can increase the income of commune members. According to the current level of agricultural production, the income distribution of the people's commune should implement less deduction and more distribution. The principle of running the commune diligently and thriftily must be adhered to. Production expenses should also pay attention to economic effects and avoid waste. Management fees and other non-productive expenses that are too large should be resolutely compressed. Even necessary expenses should strive to be economical, oppose waste, and spend less money to do more things. All expenses must not be used for the part that commune members should be allocated, and it is necessary to ensure that distribution is timely cashed. At the same time, full use should be made of the gaps between farming activities to develop diversified operations and sideline production to increase the cash income of commune members. The phenomenon of only grasping agriculture and not grasping sideline production must be overcome. The distribution relationship is one of the important contents of the relations of production. The rural people's commune at the current stage is socialist in nature and must implement the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work." In the part distributed to commune members for personal consumption, the supply part should not exceed 30%, and the wage part should account for 70%. And the system of pre-paying wages monthly or bi-monthly, at least quarterly, must be resolutely implemented. From each according to his ability is a prerequisite for distribution according to work. All people with labor capacity should do their best and actively labor. In addition to strengthening political and ideological work and educating the masses to consciously participate in labor, necessary measures should also be taken from the distribution methods and labor management system to encourage the masses to actively labor and combine political work with material guarantees. The basic labor day system must be effectively implemented, and the labor quota management, work evaluation and scorekeeping, and other effective systems must be improved to further improve the labor management of the production team.

In socialist society, the relationship between people must be constantly adjusted and improved. Improving the work style of cadres at all levels of the commune and strengthening the ties between cadres and the broad masses of the people is of great significance for further consolidating the commune and developing production. The broad masses of rural cadres have made their best efforts to run the people's communes. In all kinds of heavy and complex work, they have forged ahead and worked hard, and a large number of outstanding people loved by the masses have emerged. However, some cadres also have problems with their thinking and work style, and their implementation of the Party's policies is not serious enough. We must further carry forward the traditional work style of hard work and simplicity and sharing weal and woe with the masses that our Party had during the Yan'an period. The style of "four togethers" of eating together, living together, working together, and consulting with the masses should be vigorously promoted, and the regulations for cadres at all levels to participate in labor should be strictly implemented. The situation where some people do not participate in or rarely participate in labor among cadres at all levels of the commune must be resolutely and quickly changed. All cadres at the provincial, prefectural, county, and commune levels who go to the front line of agricultural production must eat in the same hall as the masses and eat the same food. All cadres must at all times humbly listen to the opinions of the masses and respect the opinions of the masses, and must never abuse the Party's prestige and the power given by the people. In considering and handling all issues, attention should be paid to the demands of the masses, starting from the interests of the broad masses, and unifying responsibility to the superiors with responsibility to the masses.

Resolutely Implement Policies and Better Continue the Leap Forward

In order to further consolidate the economic foundation of the people's communes, attention must be paid to constantly adjusting the superstructure. The process of running the people's commune well is also a process of continuous deepening of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front. The struggle between the two lines and the two roads will continue to exist for a long time during the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction. In order to further run the people's communes well, all localities must make use of the slack farming period this winter and next spring to deeply mobilize the masses, sum up the work experience of the people's communes, resolutely, unreservedly, and swiftly implement the Party Central Committee's policies and instructions on rural people's communes; at the same time, seriously transform backward teams and purify the rural Party's grassroots organizations, and further give play to the role of the rural Party organizations as fortresses. The Party's policies must be brought to the attention of the broad masses, so that they are truly known to every household. The masses should be boldly mobilized and relied upon, and problems should be solved by combining leadership with the masses. At the same time, we must never relax our vigilance because of the great victories of the socialist revolution and socialist construction. We must know that there are still complex and sharp struggles between ourselves and the enemy. The method of class analysis must be used to constantly pay attention to identifying the wind direction and grasp the dynamics of the classes. Socialist and communist education should be conducted regularly among the broad masses to raise their political and ideological awareness and increase their revolutionary vigilance. Counter-revolutionary elements engaged in sabotage activities must be resolutely and timely given severe blows to further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and defend socialist construction.

The Party's lines, principles, and policies are important components of the political superstructure. If they are implemented well, the economic foundation can be consolidated and developed. Conversely, it will hinder the development of the foundation. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Only when the Party's policies and tactics are all on the right track can the Chinese revolution be victorious." This is the case for revolution, and it is also the case for construction and production. Therefore, it must be understood that policy is the starting point for all practical actions of a revolutionary political party. In terms of socialist construction, after eleven years of struggle, especially after the continuous leap forward in the past three years, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have formulated the general line of socialist construction and a complete set of principles and policies to guide all aspects of work. Practice has repeatedly proven that the Party's line and various policies are completely correct and have strong vitality. Now, the center of the problem is to adopt a correct attitude and a correct work style to thoroughly and unreservedly implement the Party's line and policies. The Party organizations at all levels in Shaanxi Province and the vast majority of Party members are loyal to the implementation of the Party's line and policies. It is precisely because of the formation of unity in thought and action in the whole Party on the basis of the Party's correct line and correct policies that we can lead the people of the whole province to realize the continuous deepening of the socialist revolution and the continuous leap forward of socialist construction. However, in this regard, it should also be seen that some grassroots organizations are impure, and hostile elements have usurped the leadership and deliberately sabotaged the Party's policies. Not only that, but some of our comrades have not studied the Party's policies carefully enough and have not implemented them seriously enough.

The problem of not seriously implementing policies is, in the final analysis, a matter of Party spirit. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: "Policy and tactics are the life of the Party." Therefore, inconsistency between words and deeds on the Party's policies is deception of the Party; discounting the Party's policies is discounting one's own Party spirit; disloyalty to the Party's policies is disloyalty to the Party. Party organizations at all levels and all Party members and all cadres must seriously treat this issue, from top to bottom, from leading organs to grassroots organizations, resolutely implement the Party's policies, and conscientiously improve their work style.

In order to resolutely implement policies, the following must be done:

First, strengthen learning and improve understanding. The central key to implementing the Party's policies lies first in improving the level of Marxist-Leninist consciousness of cadres, especially improving the theoretical level and policy level of the main responsible cadres at the provincial, prefectural, county, and commune levels. To this end, while organizing cadres to study Volume IV of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," they should also organize cadres to study the Party Central Committee's policies and instructions on the people's communes. Training courses should also be run for cadres at all levels of the commune to conduct policy education, so that they understand the basic principles and various policies related to the people's communes, and fundamentally ensure the implementation of the Party's policies.

Second, establish systems for discussing the Party's policies and instructions and checking the implementation of policies. Party organizations at all levels must, without exception, seriously and conscientiously discuss all the Party's guidelines, policies, resolutions, and instructions at the Party committee. On the basis of the Party's policies and instructions, unify the understanding within the Party, and formulate specific measures for implementation based on the specific circumstances of the time and place. At the same time, the method of communication to the end should be adopted to let the Party's policies meet the masses. The implementation of policies should be checked regularly, and once problems are discovered, they should be solved immediately. The system of requesting instructions and reporting must be strictly implemented, and organizational and disciplinary phenomena must be opposed. Criticism and self-criticism should be fully carried out, and comrades who faithfully implement policies and maintain close ties with the masses should be commended; those who do not seriously implement policies or even violate policies should be seriously criticized and struggled against.

Third, conscientiously improve the work style. Provincial and prefectural-level organs must, without exception, effectively implement the "three-thirds system" leadership method. Cadres at the county level and below must adhere to the "two-fifths system" or "three-sevenths system" leadership method. People who go down to stay at points must go deep into the masses, eat together, live together, work together, consult together, and share weal and woe with the masses. People who travel around to check work are not just running around and looking around, but are to meticulously check the implementation of various policies, and work with local comrades to implement the Party's policies in every grassroots unit, and conduct in-depth investigations and studies, and promptly reflect the true new situations and new problems to the Party. Those who remain in the organs to handle daily work should also often communicate with the bottom, understand and study the situation and problems in the implementation of policies. In short, it is necessary to truly overcome bureaucracy and subjectivism, and continue to carry forward our Party's traditional work style of maintaining close ties with the masses and seeking truth from facts.

The achievements we have made are unprecedented, the situation we face is extremely good, and our future is infinitely bright. Although there are still some difficulties on our road forward, these difficulties are local, temporary, and developing difficulties. Difficulties will always exist, the question is how we treat difficulties. Avoiding difficulties and fearing difficulties may turn small difficulties into large difficulties. Facing difficulties squarely and not fearing difficulties will surely overcome difficulties and transform difficulties into positive factors that promote our victory. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out in the editor's note of the article "The Secretary Starts, the Whole Party Runs the Commune" that the Wang Guofan Cooperative is the image of our entire country. He said: "Social wealth is created by the workers, peasants, and working intellectuals themselves. As long as these people master their own destiny and have a Marxist-Leninist line, do not evade problems, but use a positive attitude to solve problems, any human difficulty can always be solved." Today's China and today's Shaanxi Province are in a much better situation and have much better conditions than the Wang Guofan Cooperative in 1955. As long as we resolutely implement the Party's policies, go all out, overcome difficulties, go deep into the grassroots, go deep into the masses, work hard to become strong, rely on our own efforts, work hard, build the country diligently and thriftily, we will be fully able to achieve continuous bumper harvests in agriculture, and on the basis of continuous bumper harvests in agriculture, promote the better and continuous leap forward of the entire national economy.
