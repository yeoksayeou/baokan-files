Promoting National Economic Development on the Basis of Agriculture
Zhang Desheng, First Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

Grain First, Increase Grain Production by Every Possible Means

Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and grain is the foundation of the foundation. Over the years, especially in recent years, we have increasingly realized that the rapid development of agriculture is the central link in the high-speed and proportionate development of the national economy. People need to eat every day. Whether it is running industry, transportation, education, basic construction, or any other undertaking, it is inseparable from grain. The development of various undertakings depends first and foremost on how much commodity grain and labor agriculture provides to society; only with the rapid development of agriculture can there be a rapid development of the entire national economy. In the past few years, the achievements on the agricultural front in Shaanxi Province have been unprecedentedly great. Especially since 1958, we have experienced two years of continuous drought out of three. We not only overcame the severe disasters that had not occurred for many years, but also won the continuous leap forward in agricultural production, which promoted the comprehensive leap forward in the entire national economy. At the same time, in the struggle against drought, farmland capital construction centered on water conservancy has been greatly developed, enhancing the ability to resist natural disasters. However, it must be seen that the current level of agricultural production is still very low, and continuous natural disasters in the past two years have caused certain difficulties for the development of agricultural production; while the development of the national economy and the improvement of people's living standards have an increasingly high demand for agriculture. This is a contradiction. The primary task of the entire Party and the entire people for a considerable period is to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production. Grain first, we must increase grain production by every possible means.

In order to strive for a bumper harvest of grain and other crops, in terms of agricultural production, we must implement the policy of both multiple cropping for more yield and high yield for more yield. At present, special attention should be paid to multiple cropping for more yield. Multiple cropping is the foundation of more yield. In order to have multiple cropping, we must not only strictly control the land used for basic construction and pay great attention to saving land, but also actively and systematically reclaim all possible wasteland and transform river滩land, and make full use of idle land and small scattered plots of land, to expand the cultivated area as much as possible. At the same time, we must actively create conditions to gradually and appropriately increase the multiple cropping index and expand the sown area. How much to re-crop mainly depends on the conditions such as water, fertilizer, labor, and livestock, and should be determined according to local conditions.

High yield for more yield is the basic way to increase agricultural production. At present, in Shaanxi Province, there are not many high-yield areas, but there are many low-yield areas. We must not only focus on large-area high-yield and general field crops, but also focus on transforming low-yield fields, so that high-yield fields become even higher-yield, and low-yield fields become high-yield. For the transformation of low-yield fields, on the one hand, high-yield crops should be planted, and high-yield varieties suitable for the local area should be selected, and field management should be strengthened; on the other hand, the soil should be fundamentally improved. The soil of low-yield fields can be completely transformed, the problem is to have a revolutionary drive to transform nature and practical measures. Some places in the Yan'an and Yulin prefectures, on the basis of mountain management, water management, and sand control, are vigorously engaged in high-yield mountains and high-yield gullies, combining mountain management, water management measures, and other various measures closely together, transforming one mountain and one gully in a concentrated and comprehensive manner. These practices are very good and should be promoted.

The experience of the past few years has repeatedly proven that on the basis of fully implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, we must prominently focus on water conservancy and fertilizer. No matter what region or what soil, as long as water conservancy and fertilizer are improved, yields can be greatly increased. To overcome drought, relying solely on surface water is not enough, we must combine storage, diversion, and lifting, and use all three waters (sky water, surface water, and groundwater). Some of the existing water conservancy projects in Shaanxi Province are not yet complete and cannot benefit, and the guarantee rate of those that can benefit is not high. If there is a prolonged drought and the river water dries up, the area that can be guaranteed for irrigation will be even smaller. Therefore, while extensively using surface water, we must also advance towards groundwater. To fundamentally change the face of drought, we must also vigorously carry out soil and water conservation, combine mountain management, water management, and sand control, and plant trees and forests on a large scale in a planned manner, while protecting the existing forests. However, the scale and speed of water conservancy and other farmland capital construction should be arranged under the condition of guaranteeing the labor force needed for the current year's production, and efforts should be concentrated to ensure key points. This winter and next spring, we must concentrate our efforts to first carry out supporting projects and finishing projects that can be effective in the current year. In places where the main projects have been completed or are about to be completed, we must open canals, level land, and give full play to irrigation benefits as soon as possible. For a large increase in grain production, there must be both a large development of water conservancy and a large increase in fertilizer. The current problem of insufficient fertilizer is very prominent. We must implement the policy of simultaneously emphasizing both farm manure and chemical fertilizers. To focus on fertilizer, we must first focus on farm manure, vigorously engage in pig and sheep raising to accumulate manure, plant and compost green manure on a large scale, and accumulate more manure and accumulate good manure. We must combine regular manure accumulation with crash manure accumulation, and combine collective manure accumulation with individual manure accumulation by commune members. At the same time, we must actively build chemical fertilizer plants. The "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture is closely linked, mutually promoting, and indispensable. Therefore, while focusing on water conservancy and fertilizer, we must also focus on other measures and do so in a manner appropriate to local conditions and without violating the farming season.

Without a developed animal husbandry, the development of agriculture will be greatly affected. The development of animal husbandry should focus on pigs, cattle, and sheep. To develop pig raising, we must implement the policy of simultaneously emphasizing public raising and private raising. Public raising should emphasize both large collectives and small collectives, with production teams and public canteens as the main ones. Private pig raising by commune members should also be encouraged and supported. Before the realization of mechanized farming, cattle are the basic power for agricultural production. After the realization of mechanized farming, cattle are still indispensable. Special attention should be paid to development, the experience of combining raising and use should be actively promoted, and the feeding and service systems should be effectively improved, and the feed problem for livestock should be effectively solved. In addition to fully collecting wild feed, land that can be used should be used to establish feed bases. Pig farms and pastures run by counties and communes should advocate the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry, using agriculture to support animal husbandry, using fertilizer to nourish fields, and diversifying operations for comprehensive development.

Guarantee the Necessary Labor Force for Agriculture and Actively Carry Out Technical Transformation of Agriculture

In order to change the backward state of agricultural production, the labor force on the agricultural front must be strengthened. People are the decisive factor in productivity. Especially since the technical transformation of agriculture has just begun, and the technical level of agriculture is still very low, under such circumstances, guaranteeing the necessary labor force for the front line of agricultural production has become the central key to increasing grain production at present. The rural labor force (including full labor, half labor, excluding auxiliary labor) should reach more than 40% of the total rural population, of which full labor accounts for two-thirds. Taking the total number of full and half rural labor as 100, the labor force occupied by the commune and production team levels should not exceed 5%, and the remaining 95% should be at the disposal of the production team. Wasting labor is the greatest waste, and saving labor is the greatest saving. A mass movement that advocates saving labor and opposes wasting labor must be launched. At the same time, counties, communes, and production teams should make overall arrangements and use the rural labor force reasonably. During the busy farming season, ensure that at least 80% or more of the rural labor force participates in field production. In addition to comprehensive arrangements throughout the year, short-term and clever arrangements should be made for each agricultural activity, and timely adjustments should be made to balance, in order to concentrate superior forces to solve the most pressing problems in current agricultural production. While ensuring grain production, the labor force necessary for forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery should also be reasonably arranged, and labor management should be strengthened and labor organization improved.

Industrial, commercial, cultural, and educational departments should also save all possible labor to support the front line of agricultural production. Of course, industry must develop and must have a certain labor force, but in order to ensure increased grain production, in the next few years, the labor force required for the development of industry must not be transferred from the countryside as much as possible, but must rely on carrying out technological revolution to free up the labor force. In the coming period, the technical revolution movement should still focus on reducing heavy manual labor and increasing raw materials, continue to realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading, transportation, mining, and road construction, and vigorously develop automated and semi-automated production to improve labor productivity.

The fundamental way to solve the shortage of agricultural labor is to actively carry out the technical transformation of agriculture. In the next two or three years, we must continue to carry out the mass movement of agricultural technical transformation with the improvement of tools as the main focus, and prioritize the use of improved tools for agricultural work that occupies the most labor, is the heaviest manual labor, and is the most seasonal. Build hydropower stations on a large scale, and develop power stations as much as possible. Vigorously train technicians who master agricultural machinery, strengthen the equipment maintenance capacity of agricultural machinery, and accumulate experience in the operation and management of agricultural machinery, and actively prepare for the realization of mechanized farming.

The industrial sector must take supporting agriculture as its primary task. This is the starting point for formulating industrial plans at the present time. The current issue of supporting agriculture is, first of all, to produce more and better steel. In order to produce more steel, small blast furnaces that have already been built should be technically transformed in a planned manner, and the output and quality of small blast furnaces should be continuously improved. At the same time, actively strengthen mine construction and strengthen coal mining, especially paying close attention to strengthening the mining of coal that is easy to transport. Another important aspect of supporting agriculture is to increase the manufacturing and repair of agricultural machinery and tools, and increase the production of chemical fertilizers. Speed up the construction of all agricultural machinery factories and chemical fertilizer factories that have started construction and are under preparation, and strive to put them into production ahead of schedule. The spare parts and components for manufacturing agricultural machinery and the materials for repairing agricultural tools and producing chemical fertilizers must be given priority guarantee. The materials allocated for manufacturing agricultural machinery, repairing agricultural tools, and producing chemical fertilizers must not be misappropriated. Industrial departments should not only provide more products for the development of agriculture, but also mobilize a large number of technical personnel to support the technical transformation of agriculture. The machinery industry in prefectures and counties undertakes the front-line tasks in the technical transformation of agriculture and must serve agricultural production with all its strength. Commune-run industries must be actively rectified and improved. The focus of rural commune-run industries should be on the repair and fitting of agricultural machinery and tools, and the production of fertilizers and pesticides.

Adhere to the Three-Level Ownership System with the Team as the Foundation and Further Consolidate the Rural People's Communes

The transformation of advanced agricultural production cooperatives into people's communes is a major change in the relations of production. After this change, China's rural socialist relations of production have become more adapted to the development of social productive forces. Three years of practice have proven that the people's commune is indeed the best social organization form to promote the high-speed development of the national economy. The people's communes have played an unparalleled power in overcoming the two consecutive years of severe disasters, not only promoting the leap forward in agricultural production, but also promoting the leap forward in the entire national economy. In order to run all rural people's communes better and build the socialist cause in the vast countryside faster and better, we should well sum up the rich experience accumulated by the people's communes in the past three years, further fully implement the Party Central Committee's policies on the people's communes, adjust the rural socialist relations of production, adhere to the three-level ownership system with the production team as the foundation, adhere to the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work," improve the relationship between people, further consolidate the people's communes, and promote the development of agricultural production.

Ownership is the determining link in the relations of production. The Party Central Committee's series of resolutions and instructions on the people's communes clearly pointed out the socialist nature of the rural people's communes at the current stage, and clearly stipulated that at the current stage, the means of production of the communes should implement the three-level ownership system, with the ownership at the production team level being basic, the ownership at the commune level being partial, and the production team should also have a small part of the ownership. The three-level ownership system with the production team as the foundation is suitable for the nature of the current rural productive forces in China, is adapted to the current development of rural productive forces in China, and must be stabilized for a long period.

The production team is the foundation of the people's commune. Strengthening the basic ownership of the production team is the key to developing the production of the people's commune and further consolidating the people's commune at the current stage. The basic ownership of the production team should be maintained and strengthened from both aspects, that is, from the commune aspect and the production team aspect. Of course, while we emphasize strengthening the basic ownership of the team, we must never ignore the development of the commune-owned economy. The commune-owned economy represents the great hope and great future of the people's commune, and the commune-owned economy should be developed while actively developing the team-owned economy. However, the development of the commune-owned economy should mainly rely on the income of commune-run enterprises, state investment and loans, and a certain proportion of the accumulation fund extracted from the production team in accordance with regulations, and must never take measures to weaken the team-owned economy. The power to manage production should be mainly held by the production team. The production plan of the commune should be based on the production plan of the production team and the production plan of the production team. The arrangement of crops, output targets, and technical measures should be discussed by the members and jointly formulated by the production team and the production team. The commune has the right to make necessary balances and adjustments according to the state plan, and conduct supervision and inspection, but it cannot disregard the actual situation, disregard the opinions of the production team, the production team, and the members, arbitrarily increase output targets, mechanically arrange crop areas, and forcibly promote technical measures. Necessary production collaborations between teams and between communes must be done through democratic consultation and must be strictly in accordance with the principle of equivalent exchange. Effectively acknowledging the small part of the ownership of the production team is an important aspect of adhering to the three-level ownership system with the team as the foundation. Land, labor, draft animals, and farm tools fixed for use by the production team must be registered and recorded, and no one may call them at will. The collaboration of labor and animal power between teams must also implement equivalent exchange. Bumper production should be based on the team. Quotas should truly leave room for maneuver, so that the team has surplus to exceed after efforts. The team economy, within the prescribed scope, should be allowed to develop appropriately and should not be harmed. In addition, commune members should also be encouraged and supported to raise pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, and engage in other household sideline occupations, and to cultivate their private plots well, provided that the collective labor is not affected.

Doing a good job in the income distribution of the people's commune is not only a major matter directly related to the people's food and clothing, but also an important condition for the further consolidation of the people's commune and the continuous leap forward in production. It is absolutely impossible to only grasp production and not grasp distribution. On the basis of production development and increased income, increasing the income of commune members year by year is the basic requirement for doing a good job in distribution. Efforts must be made from all aspects to achieve this requirement. The relationship between accumulation and consumption should be handled correctly in accordance with the principle that it is both conducive to the development of production and can increase the income of commune members. According to the current level of agricultural production, the income distribution of the people's commune should implement less deduction and more distribution. The principle of running the commune diligently and thriftily must be adhered to. Production expenses should also pay attention to economic effects and avoid waste. Management fees and other non-productive expenses that are too large should be resolutely compressed. Even necessary expenses should strive to be economical, oppose waste, and spend less money to do more things. All expenses must not be used for the part that commune members should be allocated, and it is necessary to ensure that distribution is timely cashed. At the same time, full use should be made of the gaps between farming activities to develop diversified operations and sideline production to increase the cash income of commune members. The phenomenon of only grasping agriculture and not grasping sideline production must be overcome. The distribution relationship is one of the important contents of the relations of production. The rural people's commune at the current stage is socialist in nature and must implement the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work." In the part distributed to commune members for personal consumption, the supply part should not exceed 30%, and the wage part should account for 70%. And the system of pre-paying wages monthly or bi-monthly, at least quarterly, must be resolutely implemented. From each according to his ability is a prerequisite for distribution according to work. All people with labor capacity should do their best and actively labor. In addition to strengthening political and ideological work and educating the masses to consciously participate in labor, necessary measures should also be taken from the distribution methods and labor management system to encourage the masses to actively labor and combine political work with material guarantees. The basic labor day system must be effectively implemented, and the labor quota management, work evaluation and scorekeeping, and other effective systems must be improved to further improve the labor management of the production team.

In socialist society, the relationship between people must be constantly adjusted and improved. Improving the work style of cadres at all levels of the commune and strengthening the ties between cadres and the broad masses of the people is of great significance for further consolidating the commune and developing production. The broad masses of rural cadres have made their best efforts to run the people's communes. In all kinds of heavy and complex work, they have forged ahead and worked hard, and a large number of outstanding people loved by the masses have emerged. However, some cadres also have problems with their thinking and work style, and their implementation of the Party's policies is not serious enough. We must further carry forward the traditional work style of hard work and simplicity and sharing weal and woe with the masses that our Party had during the Yan'an period. The style of "four togethers" of eating together, living together, working together, and consulting with the masses should be vigorously promoted, and the regulations for cadres at all levels to participate in labor should be strictly implemented. The situation where some people do not participate in or rarely participate in labor among cadres at all levels of the commune must be resolutely and quickly changed. All cadres at the provincial, prefectural, county, and commune levels who go to the front line of agricultural production must eat in the same hall as the masses and eat the same food. All cadres must at all times humbly listen to the opinions of the masses and respect the opinions of the masses, and must never abuse the Party's prestige and the power given by the people. In considering and handling all issues, attention should be paid to the demands of the masses, starting from the interests of the broad masses, and unifying responsibility to the superiors with responsibility to the masses.

Resolutely Implement Policies and Better Continue the Leap Forward

In order to further consolidate the economic foundation of the people's communes, attention must be paid to constantly adjusting the superstructure. The process of running the people's commune well is also a process of continuous deepening of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front. The struggle between the two lines and the two roads will continue to exist for a long time during the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction. In order to further run the people's communes well, all localities must make use of the slack farming period this winter and next spring to deeply mobilize the masses, sum up the work experience of the people's communes, resolutely, unreservedly, and swiftly implement the Party Central Committee's policies and instructions on rural people's communes; at the same time, seriously transform backward teams and purify the rural Party's grassroots organizations, and further give play to the role of the rural Party organizations as fortresses. The Party's policies must be brought to the attention of the broad masses, so that they are truly known to every household. The masses should be boldly mobilized and relied upon, and problems should be solved by combining leadership with the masses. At the same time, we must never relax our vigilance because of the great victories of the socialist revolution and socialist construction. We must know that there are still complex and sharp struggles between ourselves and the enemy. The method of class analysis must be used to constantly pay attention to identifying the wind direction and grasp the dynamics of the classes. Socialist and communist education should be conducted regularly among the broad masses to raise their political and ideological awareness and increase their revolutionary vigilance. Counter-revolutionary elements engaged in sabotage activities must be resolutely and timely given severe blows to further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and defend socialist construction.

The Party's lines, principles, and policies are important components of the political superstructure. If they are implemented well, the economic foundation can be consolidated and developed. Conversely, it will hinder the development of the foundation. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Only when the Party's policies and tactics are all on the right track can the Chinese revolution be victorious." This is the case for revolution, and it is also the case for construction and production. Therefore, it must be understood that policy is the starting point for all practical actions of a revolutionary political party. In terms of socialist construction, after eleven years of struggle, especially after the continuous leap forward in the past three years, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have formulated the general line of socialist construction and a complete set of principles and policies to guide all aspects of work. Practice has repeatedly proven that the Party's line and various policies are completely correct and have strong vitality. Now, the center of the problem is to adopt a correct attitude and a correct work style to thoroughly and unreservedly implement the Party's line and policies. The Party organizations at all levels in Shaanxi Province and the vast majority of Party members are loyal to the implementation of the Party's line and policies. It is precisely because of the formation of unity in thought and action in the whole Party on the basis of the Party's correct line and correct policies that we can lead the people of the whole province to realize the continuous deepening of the socialist revolution and the continuous leap forward of socialist construction. However, in this regard, it should also be seen that some grassroots organizations are impure, and hostile elements have usurped the leadership and deliberately sabotaged the Party's policies. Not only that, but some of our comrades have not studied the Party's policies carefully enough and have not implemented them seriously enough.

The problem of not seriously implementing policies is, in the final analysis, a matter of Party spirit. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: "Policy and tactics are the life of the Party." Therefore, inconsistency between words and deeds on the Party's policies is deception of the Party; discounting the Party's policies is discounting one's own Party spirit; disloyalty to the Party's policies is disloyalty to the Party. Party organizations at all levels and all Party members and all cadres must seriously treat this issue, from top to bottom, from leading organs to grassroots organizations, resolutely implement the Party's policies, and conscientiously improve their work style.

In order to resolutely implement policies, the following must be done:

First, strengthen learning and improve understanding. The central key to implementing the Party's policies lies first in improving the level of Marxist-Leninist consciousness of cadres, especially improving the theoretical level and policy level of the main responsible cadres at the provincial, prefectural, county, and commune levels. To this end, while organizing cadres to study Volume IV of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," they should also organize cadres to study the Party Central Committee's policies and instructions on the people's communes. Training courses should also be run for cadres at all levels of the commune to conduct policy education, so that they understand the basic principles and various policies related to the people's communes, and fundamentally ensure the implementation of the Party's policies.

Second, establish systems for discussing the Party's policies and instructions and checking the implementation of policies. Party organizations at all levels must, without exception, seriously and conscientiously discuss all the Party's guidelines, policies, resolutions, and instructions at the Party committee. On the basis of the Party's policies and instructions, unify the understanding within the Party, and formulate specific measures for implementation based on the specific circumstances of the time and place. At the same time, the method of communication to the end should be adopted to let the Party's policies meet the masses. The implementation of policies should be checked regularly, and once problems are discovered, they should be solved immediately. The system of requesting instructions and reporting must be strictly implemented, and organizational and disciplinary phenomena must be opposed. Criticism and self-criticism should be fully carried out, and comrades who faithfully implement policies and maintain close ties with the masses should be commended; those who do not seriously implement policies or even violate policies should be seriously criticized and struggled against.

Third, conscientiously improve the work style. Provincial and prefectural-level organs must, without exception, effectively implement the "three-thirds system" leadership method. Cadres at the county level and below must adhere to the "two-fifths system" or "three-sevenths system" leadership method. People who go down to stay at points must go deep into the masses, eat together, live together, work together, consult together, and share weal and woe with the masses. People who travel around to check work are not just running around and looking around, but are to meticulously check the implementation of various policies, and work with local comrades to implement the Party's policies in every grassroots unit, and conduct in-depth investigations and studies, and promptly reflect the true new situations and new problems to the Party. Those who remain in the organs to handle daily work should also often communicate with the bottom, understand and study the situation and problems in the implementation of policies. In short, it is necessary to truly overcome bureaucracy and subjectivism, and continue to carry forward our Party's traditional work style of maintaining close ties with the masses and seeking truth from facts.

The achievements we have made are unprecedented, the situation we face is extremely good, and our future is infinitely bright. Although there are still some difficulties on our road forward, these difficulties are local, temporary, and developing difficulties. Difficulties will always exist, the question is how we treat difficulties. Avoiding difficulties and fearing difficulties may turn small difficulties into large difficulties. Facing difficulties squarely and not fearing difficulties will surely overcome difficulties and transform difficulties into positive factors that promote our victory. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out in the editor's note of the article "The Secretary Starts, the Whole Party Runs the Commune" that the Wang Guofan Cooperative is the image of our entire country. He said: "Social wealth is created by the workers, peasants, and working intellectuals themselves. As long as these people master their own destiny and have a Marxist-Leninist line, do not evade problems, but use a positive attitude to solve problems, any human difficulty can always be solved." Today's China and today's Shaanxi Province are in a much better situation and have much better conditions than the Wang Guofan Cooperative in 1955. As long as we resolutely implement the Party's policies, go all out, overcome difficulties, go deep into the grassroots, go deep into the masses, work hard to become strong, rely on our own efforts, work hard, build the country diligently and thriftily, we will be fully able to achieve continuous bumper harvests in agriculture, and on the basis of continuous bumper harvests in agriculture, promote the better and continuous leap forward of the entire national economy.

    以农业为基础促进国民经济的发展
    中共陕西省委第一书记　张德生
    粮食第一，千方百计增产粮食
    农业是国民经济的基础，粮食是基础的基础。多年来特别是最近几年以来，我们越来越深刻地体会到，农业的迅速发展，是高速度按比例地发展国民经济的中心环节。人是每天要吃饭的，不论办工业、办交通、办教育、办基本建设，办任何一项事业，都离不开粮食。各项事业的发展，首先取决于农业为社会提供多少商品粮食和劳动力；有了农业的迅速发展，才会有整个国民经济的迅速发展。过去几年来，陕西省农业战线上的成绩是空前伟大的。特别是1958年以来，三年中有两年连续大旱，我们不仅战胜了多年来没有过的严重灾害，而且赢得了农业生产的持续跃进，促进了整个国民经济的全面跃进。同时，在同干旱作斗争中，使以水利为中心的农田基本建设得到了巨大的发展，增强了抵御自然灾害的能力。但是，必须看到，现在的农业生产水平还是很低的，连续两年的自然灾害，又给农业生产的发展造成了一定的困难；而国民经济的发展和人民生活水平的提高，对于农业的需要，越来越高。这是一个矛盾。全党全民在相当长时期以内的首要任务，就是大办农业，大办粮食。粮食第一，必须千方百计地增产粮食。
    为了争取实现粮食和其他农作物的丰收，在农业生产方面，必须贯彻执行多种多收和高产多收同时并举的方针。目前，特别要注意多种多收。多种是多收的基础。为了多种，不仅要严格控制基本建设用地，十分重视节约土地，而且必须积极地、有计划地开垦一切可能开垦的荒地和改造河滩地，充分利用闲散土地和小块零星土地，尽可能地扩大耕地面积。同时，要积极创造条件，逐步地、适当地提高复种指数，扩大播种面积。复种多少，主要看水、肥、劳力、畜力等条件，因地制宜地确定。
    高产多收是农业增产的基本途径。目前，陕西省农作物的产量，高产地区不多，低产地区却不少。我们既要抓大面积丰产和一般大田的作物，又要抓改造低产田，使高产的更高产，低产的变高产。对低产田的改造，一方面要种植高产作物，选用适宜于当地的高产品种，加强田间管理；另一方面要从根本上改良土壤。低产田的土壤是完全能够改造的，问题在于要有一股改造自然的革命干劲和切实的措施。延安、榆林专区有些地方，在治山、治水、治沙的基础上，大搞丰产山、丰产沟，把治山、治水的措施和其他各种措施紧密结合起来，一架山、一条沟集中地、综合地改造，这些作法是很好的，应当加以推广。
    几年来的经验一再证明：在全面贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”的基础上，必须突出地抓水利和肥料。不论什么地区，什么土壤，只要水利和肥料赶上去，产量就可以大幅度地增长。战胜干旱，光靠地上水不行，必须蓄、引、提并举，三水（天上水、地面水、地下水）齐用。陕西省现有水利工程，有些还不成套不能受益，能受益的保证率也不高，如果久旱不雨、河水断流，能够保证灌溉的面积就更少了。所以，必须在广泛利用地上水的同时，向地下水进军。要根本改变干旱面貌，还必须大力进行水土保持，结合治山治水治沙，有计划地大量地植树造林，同时保护好现有森林。但是，水利等农田基本建设的规模和速度，要在保证当年生产所需要的劳动力的条件下去安排，并且要集中力量，保证重点。今冬明春要集中力量，首先进行当年能够见效的配套工程和收尾工程，在主体工程已经建成和即将建成的地方，要开渠、整地，尽快发挥灌溉效益。粮食大增产，既要水利大发展，又要肥料大增加。目前肥料不足的问题很突出。一定要贯彻执行农家肥料和化学肥料同时并举的方针，抓肥料首先要抓农家肥料，大搞养猪养羊积肥，大种、大沤绿肥，多积肥，积好肥。要把经常积肥和突击积肥结合起来，把集体积肥和社员个人积肥结合起来。同时，积极兴建化肥厂。农业的“八字宪法”，是密切联系、互相促进、缺一不可的，因此在抓水利和肥料的同时，还要抓紧其他各项措施，并且做到因地制宜，不违农时。
    没有发达的畜牧业，农业的发展会受到很大的影响。畜牧业的发展，应以猪、牛、羊为重点。发展养猪业，必须贯彻执行公养和私养并举的方针。而公养又要大集体、小集体同时并举，以生产小队和公共食堂为主。对于社员私人养猪也要予以鼓励和支持。在实现机耕化以前，牛是农业生产的基本动力，在实现机耕化以后，牛仍然是不可缺少的，应当特别注意发展，积极推行养用结合的经验，切实改进饲养、使役等制度，切实解决牲畜的饲料问题。除了充分采集野生饲料以外，还要利用可以利用的土地，建立饲料基地。县、社办的猪场和牧场，要提倡农牧结合，以农养牧，以肥养田，多种经营，综合发展。
    保证农业所必需的劳动力，积极进行农业的技术改造
    为了改变农业生产的落后状况，必须加强农业战线的劳动力。人是生产力的决定因素。特别是目前农业的技术改造刚刚开始，农业的技术水平还很低，在这样的情况下，保证农业生产第一线所必需的劳动力，就成为当前增加粮食生产的中心关键。应当使农村劳动力（包括全劳动力、半劳动力，不包括辅助劳动力）达到农村总人口的40％以上，其中全劳动力占三分之二。以农村全、半劳动力的总数作为100，公社和生产队两级占用的劳动力，不能超过5％，其余95％归生产小队支配。浪费劳动力是最大的浪费，节约劳动力是最大的节约。必须开展一个提倡节约劳动力、反对浪费劳动力的群众运动。同时，县、社、生产队对于农村劳动力要统筹安排，合理使用。在农忙季节，保证至少有80％以上的农村劳动力参加田间生产。除了全年全面安排以外，还要按每一段农事活动，短安排、巧安排，及时调整平衡，以便集中优势力量，解决当前农业生产中最迫切的问题。在保证粮食生产的同时，对林牧副渔各业所必需的劳动力，也要合理安排，并且要加强劳动管理，改善劳动组织。
    工业、商业、文教事业等部门，也要节约一切可以节约的劳动力，支援农业生产第一线。当然，工业要发展，必须有一定的劳动力，但是，为了保证粮食增产，在最近几年内，发展工业所需要的劳动力，必须尽可能地不从农村抽调，而要依靠开展技术革命，腾出劳动力来。今后一个时期内，技术革命运动，仍应以减轻笨重体力劳动和增产原材料为重点，继续实现装卸、搬运、采掘、筑路等方面的机械化、半机械化，并且大力发展自动化、半自动化的生产，提高劳动生产率。
    解决农业劳动力不足的根本出路，在于积极进行农业技术改造。最近两、三年内，要继续开展以改良工具为主的农业技术改造的群众运动，尽先让占用劳动力最多、体力劳动最重，季节性最强的农活，使用改良工具。大办水力站，尽可能地发展电力站。大力培训掌握农业机械的技术人员，加强农业机械的设备维修能力，积累经营管理农业机械的经验，为实现机耕化积极做好准备工作。
    工业部门必须以支援农业为首要任务，这是目前时期制定工业计划的出发点。当前支援农业的问题，首先是要生产更多、更好的钢铁。为了多产钢铁，对于已经建成的小高炉，要有计划地进行技术改造，不断提高小高炉的产量和质量。同时，积极加强矿山建设，加强煤炭的开采，特别是要十分注意加强便于运输的煤炭的开采。支援农业的另一个重要方面，就是增加农业机械和农具的制造与修配，增加化肥的生产。加快所有开始建设和正在筹建的农业机械厂、化肥厂的建设速度，力争提前投入生产。制造农业机械的备品、备件和修配的材料，必须优先保证。分配给制造农械、修理农具和生产化肥的材料，不得挪用。工业部门不仅要为农业的发展提供更多的产品，而且要动员大批的技术力量，支援农业的技术改造。专区和县的机械工业，在农业技术改造方面，担负着第一线的任务，必须全力为农业生产服务。社办工业必须积极加以整顿和提高。农村社办工业的重点，应当放在农械、农具的修配和肥料、农药生产方面。
    坚持队为基础的三级所有制，进一步巩固农村人民公社
    高级农业生产合作社转变为人民公社，这是生产关系上的一次重大的变革。经过这一变革，我国农村社会主义的生产关系就更加适应社会生产力的发展了。三年来的实践证明，人民公社确实是促进国民经济高速度发展的最好的社会组织形式。人民公社在战胜连续两年的特大灾害中，发挥了无比的威力，不仅促进了农业生产的跃进，而且促进了整个国民经济的跃进。为了把全部农村人民公社办得更好，把广大农村的社会主义事业建设得更快更好，我们应该很好地总结人民公社三年来积累的丰富经验，进一步全面地贯彻执行党中央有关人民公社的政策，调整农村社会主义的生产关系，坚持人民公社以生产队为基础的三级所有制，坚持“各尽所能，按劳分配”的原则，改善人与人之间的关系，进一步巩固人民公社，促进农业生产的发展。
    所有制是生产关系的决定环节。党中央关于人民公社的一系列决议、指示，明确指出了目前阶段农村人民公社的社会主义性质，并且明确规定在目前阶段公社的生产资料要实行三级所有制，生产队一级的所有权是基本的，公社一级的所有权是部分的，而生产小队也应该有小部分的所有权。以生产队为基础的三级所有制，是适合当前我国农村生产力的性质的，是同我国当前农村生产力发展状况相适应的，必须在一个长时期内稳定下来。
    生产队是人民公社的基础，加强生产队的基本所有制是现阶段发展人民公社生产和进一步巩固人民公社的关键。要从上下两方面，即从公社方面和生产小队方面来维护和加强生产队的基本所有制。当然，我们在强调加强队的基本所有制的时候，绝不能忽视社有经济的发展。社有经济代表着人民公社的伟大希望和伟大前途，应该在积极发展队有经济的同时，发展社有经济。但是社有经济的发展，应该主要依靠社办企业的收入、国家的投资和贷款以及按照规定向生产队提取的一定比例的公积金，绝不能采取削弱队有经济的办法。管理生产的权力，应该主要由生产队掌握。公社的生产计划，应该建立在生产队的生产计划和生产小队的包产计划的基础上。作物安排、产量指标和技术措施，应该经过社员讨论，由生产队和生产小队共同商量制定。公社有权根据国家计划进行必要的平衡和调整，并且进行督促和检查，但是不能不问实际情况，不听生产队、生产小队和社员的意见，任意提高产量指标，机械安排作物面积，硬性推行技术措施。队队之间，社社之间，确属必要的生产协作，必须经过民主协商，切实按照等价交换的原则办事。切实承认生产小队的小部分所有制，是坚持以队为基础的三级所有制的一个重要方面。固定归生产小队使用的土地、劳力、耕畜、农具，要登记造册，任何人不得随便调用。小队之间劳畜力的协作，也必须实行等价交换。丰产方应以小队为单位。包产指标，一定要真正留有余地，要使小队经过努力，有产可超。小队经济，在规定的范围内，应允许有适当的发展，不得损害。另外，还应当在不影响集体劳动的前提下，鼓励和支持社员饲养猪、羊、鸡、鸭和经营其他家庭副业，种好自留地。
    做好人民公社的收入分配，既是直接关系群众吃饭穿衣的大事情，也是关系人民公社进一步巩固和生产不断跃进的重要条件，绝不能只抓生产，不抓分配。在生产发展收入增加的基础上，使社员的收入逐年有所增加，是做好分配工作的基本要求。必须从各方面努力，实现这一要求。积累与消费的关系，要按照既有利于发展生产，又能使社员增加收入的原则，正确地加以处理。按照目前的农业生产水平，人民公社的收入分配，应当实行少扣多分。要坚持勤俭办社原则。生产开支也要讲求经济效果，避免浪费。管理费用和其他非生产性开支过大的，要坚决压缩下来。就是必要的开支也要力求节约，反对浪费，要少花钱多办事。一切开支都不能挪用社员应分得的部分，要保证分配及时兑现。同时，还要充分利用农事间隙，开展多种经营和副业生产，增加社员现金收入。只抓农业，不抓副业的现象，必须加以克服。分配关系是生产关系的重要内容之一，现阶段农村人民公社是社会主义性质的，必须实行“各尽所能，按劳分配”的原则。在分配给社员个人消费的部分中，供给部分不应超过30％，工资部分应该占70％。而且要坚决实行按月或按双月、至少按季预发工资的制度。各尽所能是按劳分配的前提。一切有劳动能力的人，都应该各尽所能，积极劳动。除了加强政治思想工作，教育群众自觉地参加劳动以外，还要从分配办法和劳动管理制度上，采取必要的措施，鼓励群众积极劳动，把政治工作和物质保证结合起来。要切实执行基本劳动日制度，健全劳动定额管理、评工记分等行之有效的制度，进一步改进生产队的劳动管理。
    在社会主义社会中，人与人之间的关系，必须经常不断地进行调整和改善。改进公社各级干部的工作作风，密切干部和广大群众的联系，对于进一步巩固公社和发展生产，具有十分重要的意义。广大农村干部，为着办好人民公社，尽了最大的努力，在各种繁重复杂的工作中，勇往直前，埋头苦干，涌现出大批受群众爱戴的优秀人物。但是，也有一些干部的思想作风有毛病，执行党的政策不够严肃。我们必须进一步发扬延安时期我党艰苦朴素与群众同甘共苦的传统作风。大兴和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量的“四同”之风，严格执行各级干部参加劳动的规定。公社各级干部中，一些人不参加或很少参加劳动的情况，必须坚决地、迅速地改变过来。省、地、县、社所有到农业生产第一线的干部，都要和群众同堂吃饭，吃同样的饭。所有干部，都要时刻虚心倾听群众的意见，尊重群众的意见，绝不能滥用党的威信和人民所赋予的权力。在考虑和处理一切问题时，都要注意群众的要求，从广大群众的利益出发，把对上级负责同对群众负责统一起来。
    坚决执行政策，更好地持续跃进
    为了进一步巩固人民公社的经济基础，必须注意不断地调整上层建筑。办好人民公社的过程，同时也是政治战线上和思想战线上社会主义革命不断深入的过程。两条路线和两条道路的斗争，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，还会长期存在。为了进一步办好人民公社，各地必须利用今冬明春的农闲间隙，深入发动群众，总结人民公社的工作经验，坚决地、不折不扣地、雷厉风行地执行党中央有关农村人民公社的政策和指示；同时认真改造落后社队，纯洁农村党的基层组织，进一步发挥农村党组织的堡垒作用。必须使党的政策同广大群众见面，真正做到家喻户晓。放手发动群众，依靠群众，用领导和群众相结合的办法，解决问题。同时，我们绝不能因为社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利而放松警惕，要知道敌我之间也还有复杂的尖锐的斗争。必须用阶级分析的方法，经常注意识别风向，掌握阶级动态。在广大群众中经常进行社会主义和共产主义教育，提高政治思想觉悟，提高革命警惕性。对于有破坏活动的反革命分子，要坚决地、适时地给以严厉打击，进一步巩固人民民主专政，保卫社会主义建设。
    党的路线、方针、政策，都是政治的上层建筑的重要组成部分。贯彻执行得好，就能巩固和发展经济基础。反之，则会障碍基础的发展。毛泽东同志说，“只有党的政策和策略全部走上正轨，中国革命才有胜利的可能。”搞革命如此，搞建设，搞生产也无不如此。因此，必须了解，政策是革命政党一切实际行动的出发点。就社会主义建设来说，经过十一年的奋斗，特别是经过最近三年的连续跃进，党中央和毛泽东同志已经制定了社会主义建设的总路线，和指导各方面工作的一整套方针政策。实践反复证明，党的路线和各项政策，是完全正确的，是具有强大生命力的。现在，问题的中心，就是采取正确的态度和正确的作风，使党的路线和政策，彻底地、不折不扣地付诸实现。陕西省党的各级组织和绝大多数党员，执行党的路线和政策是忠诚的，正是由于在党的正确路线和正确政策的基础上形成了在全党思想上和行动上的一致，我们才能领导全省人民，实现社会主义革命的不断深入和社会主义建设的持续跃进。但是，在这一方面，还应当看到：有些基层组织不纯，敌对分子窃取了领导权，蓄意破坏党的政策。不仅如此，我们也有一部分同志对于党的政策，学习不够认真，执行不够严肃。
    执行政策不严肃的问题，归根到底是一个党性问题。毛泽东同志曾经指出：“政策和策略是党的生命”。因而对党的政策言行不一，就是对党的欺骗；对党的政策打折扣，就是对自己的党性打折扣；对党的政策不忠实，就是对党不忠实。党的各级组织和所有的党员、所有的干部，必须严肃对待这个问题，从上到下、从领导机关到基层组织，坚决地执行党的政策，认真地改进工作作风。
    为了坚决执行政策，必须做到：
    第一，加强学习，提高认识。贯彻执行党的政策的中心关键，首先在于提高干部的马克思列宁主义的觉悟程度，特别是提高省、专、县和公社各级主要负责干部的理论水平和政策水平。为此，要在组织干部学习《毛泽东选集》第四卷的同时，组织干部学习党中央有关人民公社的政策和指示。对于公社各级干部还要开办训练班进行政策教育，使他们懂得有关人民公社的基本原理和各项政策，从根本上保证党的政策的贯彻执行。
    第二，建立讨论党的政策、指示和检查政策执行情况等制度。党的各级组织，对于党的一切方针、政策、决议、指示，都必须无例外地在党的委员会上，严肃认真地进行讨论。在党的政策、指示的基础上，统一党内的认识，并且根据当时当地的具体情况，制定贯彻执行的具体措施。同时，要采取一通到底的办法，让党的政策同群众见面。要经常检查政策执行情况，一经发现问题，立即加以解决。严格执行请示报告制度，反对无组织无纪律现象。充分开展批评与自我批评，对于忠实执行政策、密切联系群众的同志，要给以表扬；对于不认真执行政策以至违反政策的人，要进行严肃的批评和斗争。
    第三，认真改进工作作风。省级和专区一级机关，必须无例外地切实实行“三三制”领导方法。县级和县以下的干部，必须坚持“二五制”或“三七制”的领导方法。下去蹲点的人，一定要深入群众，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，同甘共苦。巡回检查工作的人，不光是跑一跑，看一看，而是要丝毫不苟地检查各项政策的执行情况，和当地同志一起，把党的政策贯彻到每一个基层单位中去，并且深入地进行调查研究，及时地向党反映真实的新情况、新问题。留在机关处理日常工作的人，也要经常地和下面通气，了解和研究执行政策中的情况和问题。总之，要切切实实地克服官僚主义和主观主义，继续发扬我党密切联系群众和实事求是的传统作风。
    我们已经取得的成绩，是史无前例的，我们面临的形势，是极为良好的，我们的前途是无限光明的。在我们前进的道路上，虽然还存在着某些困难，但是，这些困难是局部的、暂时的，是发展中的困难。困难时时会有，问题就看我们如何对待困难。回避困难，害怕困难，就可能使小困难变成大困难。正视困难，不怕困难，就一定能战胜困难，把困难转化为推动我们胜利前进的积极的因素。毛泽东同志在《书记动手，全党办社》一文的按语中曾经指出，王国藩合作社，就是我们整个国家的形象。他说：“社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的。”今天的中国，今天的陕西省，较之1955年的王国藩合作社，情况要好得多，条件要好得多。只要我们坚决执行党的政策，鼓足干劲，战胜困难，深入下层，深入群众，发愤图强，自力更生，埋头苦干，勤俭建国，我们就完全有可能实现农业的连续丰收，并且在农业连续丰收的基础上，促进整个国民经济更好地持续跃进。
