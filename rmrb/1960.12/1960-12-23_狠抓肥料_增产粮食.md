    Grasp Fertilizer Tightly to Increase Grain Production

    Formulate a Winter Fertilizer Accumulation Plan Practically and Conscientiously

    Seizing winter fertilizer accumulation and topdressing is the most urgent and crucial measure to strive for a better summer harvest next year.

    The sources of natural fertilizer accumulation in winter are quite broad. The problem before us now is that leaders at all levels should earnestly consult with the masses and formulate a practical fertilizer accumulation and application plan. First, we must adopt the method of "walking on two legs" and combining "coarse and fine" to sort out fertilizer sources. We must accumulate both mud fertilizer and stable manure; we must not only firmly grasp the accumulation and production of farmyard manure, but also transport urban fertilizer to the countryside; we must not only organize professional teams for collective fertilizer accumulation, but also collect commune members' household fertilizer at prices based on quality; we must not only have quantity, but also ensure the quality of fertilizer based on local actual conditions.

    It should be deeply understood that formulating a fertilizer accumulation plan is a meticulous task. Leading cadres must better immerse themselves among the masses, go deep into the fields and riverbanks, and conduct detailed investigations and research work with grassroots cadres and commune members to summarize the rich and effective experiences in fertilizer accumulation, production, and application in the past, and formulate reasonable plans based on the characteristics of this year's production. This is a prerequisite for carrying out the fertilizer accumulation movement in a down-to-earth manner.

    Concentrate Labor on Fertilizer Accumulation and Production

    Fertilizer accumulation and production is the central task of winter production. The primary condition for ensuring the rapid development of the fertilizer accumulation and production movement is to ensure sufficient labor. At present, the grain purchase task in some areas of Qinghai Province has been basically completed, and some areas are about to complete it or are actively completing it. In areas where grain threshing, purchase, and warehousing tasks have been completed, it is necessary to quickly transfer the main labor force to the fertilizer accumulation and production movement in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee.

    After the labor force is transferred to the fertilizer accumulation and production movement, it is necessary to use the labor force reasonably, and fully mobilize and give play to the enthusiasm and initiative of the masses. In addition to continuously conducting ideological education on "grasping fertilizer is grasping grain" and carrying out red flag emulation competitions, it is also necessary to explain the specific policies of fertilizer accumulation and production to the masses, and adhere to the principles of combining collective fertilizer accumulation with individual fertilizer accumulation, combining professional team fertilizer accumulation with everyone's participation, and combining political leadership with material guarantees. For collective fertilizer accumulation, a production responsibility system of fixed quantity, fixed quality, fixed task, and fixed time should be established, and the principles of work assessment and score recording, and distribution according to labor should be adhered to; for commune members' individual fertilizer accumulation, the method of grading and pricing, and cash purchase should be adhered to, in order to stimulate the enthusiasm of the broad masses for fertilizer accumulation.

    In addition, Qinghai Province has very rich resources for indigenous chemical fertilizer production. According to the principles of using local materials, local manufacturing, and local application, all localities should establish a number of indigenous chemical fertilizer plants on a simple basis while consolidating existing chemical fertilizer plants, and manufacture a large amount of indigenous chemical fertilizer to meet the needs of topdressing in the coming spring.

    Seize the Winter to Accumulate More High-Quality Fertilizer

    This year, Shandong Province has sown more than 50 million mu of wheat. Many areas have generally paid attention to improving the quality of sowing and increasing the application of fertilizer. However, judging from the overall situation, both the quantity and quality of fertilizer application are still far from meeting the requirements for ensuring a bumper wheat harvest next year. At the same time, the spring sowing area in our province next year will be even larger, and the amount of base fertilizer required will also be very large, and these fertilizers must also be prepared properly before spring plowing. Therefore, vigorously carrying out the fertilizer accumulation and production movement this winter and accumulating a large amount of high-quality fertilizer is of great significance for ensuring bumper harvests in summer and autumn next year.

    Large-scale accumulation of livestock pen fertilizer is a regular and main source of farmyard manure, and it is also an important link in improving fertilizer quality. According to the general level of fertilizer accumulation, each pig can accumulate about 10,000 catties of fertilizer per year, each large livestock can accumulate more than 10,000 catties of fertilizer per year, and each sheep can also accumulate 3,000 to 5,000 catties of fertilizer per year. If the manure of all livestock and poultry in the province is fully accumulated and utilized this winter and next spring, it will be a huge figure. People's communes, production teams, and commune members in various localities should vigorously strengthen the feeding and management of livestock, so as to not only do everything possible to feed the livestock well, but also frequently pad the pens, clean regularly, and accumulate more good fertilizer. At the same time, it is necessary to improve the pens as much as possible so that all large livestock, pigs, and sheep have pens and enclosures, and that all pens and enclosures are both conducive to feeding and conducive to fertilizer accumulation.

    Human excrement and urine is the best quality fertilizer among farmyard manure. At the same time, the potential of human excrement and urine is very large. If the human excrement and urine of the entire province is utilized, the fertilizer effect of only three or four months in winter can greatly exceed the annual supply of chemical fertilizer this year. At present, the utilization of human excrement and urine in many places in our province is still a weak link, and only about 40% of it has been utilized, especially the utilization of human urine is even worse. This is a problem worth noting and solving. To fully accumulate and utilize human excrement and urine, we must first improve toilets, so that there are not only public toilets, but also family toilets, so that all kinds of toilets are both hygienic and convenient for fertilizer accumulation. At the same time, we should try to make sure that every team has a urine pool, and every household has a urine tank, and strive to utilize all human excrement and urine. Using urine to water wheat in winter has a great effect on increasing production, and all localities can vigorously promote and implement it. As for miscellaneous soil fertilizer, it is everywhere. All localities should extensively mobilize the masses to use the winter slack to collect a large amount of wall soil, kang soil, stove soil, broken house soil, as well as garbage from ditches, moats, village sides, and roadsides that can be used as fertilizer for padding the pens or composting. The potential of human excrement and urine in cities and towns is also very large, and there are many garbage and sewage that can be used as fertilizer. The leading organs of cities and towns should carry out planned and organized fertilizer delivery to the countryside to support agricultural production. (Shandong Dazhong Daily)

    Fertilizer Accumulation, Preservation, and Application Must All Be Grasped

    After the "three guarantees" task is implemented, the production team should increase measures in all aspects to strive to exceed the guaranteed output. Now we should put our efforts into fertilizer. Judging from the actual situation of fertilizer work in our region, the efforts should be used in the following three links, namely, fertilizer accumulation, fertilizer preservation, and fertilizer application.

    Fertilizer accumulation. It is understood that there are no less than a dozen ways to accumulate fertilizer in various places, and all fertilizer sources must be fully utilized. However, there must also be a distinction between primary and secondary. The experience of many high-yield teams proves that the fundamental way to solve the fertilizer problem is to raise pigs and accumulate fertilizer. Where more pigs are raised and raised well, the fertilizer problem will be solved quickly and grain production will increase. From the perspective of solving the fertilizer problem, there should be two indicators to measure whether a place's pig raising work is done well: one is how many pigs are raised, and the other is how much fertilizer is accumulated. The experience of many high-yield teams also proves that while firmly grasping pig raising and fertilizer accumulation, we must also put more effort into human excrement and urine, which is wide in area, large in quantity, and high in fertilizer efficiency. At present, some places have serious losses of human excrement and urine. Each team should have public toilets, and each household should have family toilets, so that the loss of human excrement and urine will be reduced. Cattle manure, horse manure, sheep manure and other pen fertilizers are also a major source of fertilizer, and must also be firmly grasped. Raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer, accumulating human excrement and urine, and accumulating good livestock manure and pen fertilizer are the main directions for solving the fertilizer problem at present. To put in effort, we must put it in these three major fertilizer sources, so that the effort is put in the right place.

    Fertilizer preservation is also very important. Some places used to have the habit of pulling manure to the edge of the field and piling it there, and then spreading the manure when planting. In this way, the fertilizer would lose its effectiveness due to wind and sun. It is very necessary to deliver the manure to the field early, especially in mountainous areas where the land is scattered, it is necessary to transport the fertilizer early. However, fertilizer transportation must be well combined with fertilizer preservation. After the fertilizer is transported to the field, it must be sealed with soil, otherwise good fertilizer will become inferior fertilizer.

    Fertilizer application is the last link in the entire fertilizer work. In terms of fertilization methods, we should advocate ditch application, hole application, seed mixing application, and seed drill application, which are good ways to fully exert fertilizer efficiency and use fertilizer economically.

### 狠抓肥料  增产粮食

    狠抓肥料  增产粮食
    切切实实制订冬季积肥规划
    抓紧冬季积肥、追肥，是争取明年夏熟有个更好收成的一项最迫切的关键性的措施。
    冬季积聚自然肥料的肥源是相当广阔的。现在摆在我们面前的问题，就是要求各级领导认真和群众商量，制订出一个切切实实的积肥用肥的规划。首先要采取两条腿走路和粗细并举的办法进行肥源排队。既要积泥肥，又要积厩肥；既要狠狠地抓紧积造农家肥料，又要把城肥积运下乡；既要组织专业队伍进行集体积肥，又要按质论价收集社员的家肥；不仅要有数量，而且也要从当地的实际情况出发，保证肥料的质量。
    应该深刻地了解，制订积肥规划是一项细致的工作，领导干部一定要更好地深入群众，深入田头、河边，和基层干部、社员一起进行细致的调查研究工作，总结过去丰富的行之有效的积肥、造肥、用肥的经验，根据今年生产的特点，订出合理的规划，这是踏踏实实地开展积肥运动的先决条件。
                                       （江苏新华日报）
    集中劳力积肥造肥
    积肥造肥是冬季生产的中心任务。保证积肥造肥运动迅速开展的首要条件是保证足够的劳动力。当前青海省一部分地区粮食征购任务已经基本完成，一部分地区将要完成或正在积极完成，在已经完成粮食打碾、征购、入仓等任务的地区，必须遵照省委指示精神，迅速把主要劳动力转到积肥造肥运动中来。
    劳动力转入到积肥造肥运动中来之后，一定要合理使用劳力，充分调动和发挥群众的积极性和主动性。这就除了不断深入地进行“抓肥料就是抓粮食”的思想教育和开展红旗评比竞赛以外；还要向群众讲清积肥造肥的各项具体政策，坚持集体积肥和个人积肥相结合、专业队积肥和大家动手相结合、政治挂帅和物质保证相结合的原则。对于集体积肥，要建立定数量、定质量、定任务、定时间的生产责任制，坚持评工记分、按劳分配；对于社员个人积肥坚持分等论价、现金收买的办法，以激发广大群众的积肥积极性。
    此外，我省土化肥生产资源非常丰富，根据就地取材、就地制造、就地运用的原则，各地应在整顿已有化肥厂基础上，适当地因陋就简地办一批土化肥厂大量制造土化肥，以满足明春追肥的需要。
                                                （青海日报）
    抓紧冬季多积优质肥
    今年山东省播种了五千多万亩小麦。许多地区一般都注意了提高播种质量，增施肥料。但是，就总的情况看来，无论是施肥的数量还是质量，与保证明年小麦丰收的要求都有相当的距离。同时，明年我省春播面积更大，所需底肥数量也很大，这些肥料也必须在春耕以前准备妥当。因此，在今年冬季大力开展积肥造肥运动，积造大量的优质肥料，对于保证明年夏秋两季丰收，意义十分重大。
    大积牲畜栏圈肥料，是农家肥料经常的和主要的来源，也是提高肥质的一个重要环节。根据一般积肥水平，每头猪每年可积肥料一万斤左右，每头大家畜每年可积肥料一万斤以上，每头羊每年也能积肥三千斤到五千斤。如果在今冬明春把全省家畜家禽的粪便全部积攒利用起来，是一个巨大的数字。各地人民公社、生产队和社员，都应大力加强牲畜的饲养管理工作，做到既千方百计地把牲畜喂好，又勤垫栏圈、常打扫、多积好肥。同时，要尽可能地将栏圈搞好，使所有的大家畜、猪、羊都有栏有圈，并使所有栏圈既有利于喂养，又有利于积肥。
    人粪尿是农家肥料中质量最好的肥料。同时，人粪尿的潜力很大，如果全省人粪尿都利用起来的话，仅冬季三、四个月的时间，就能大大超过今年全年化肥供应量的肥效。目前，我省许多地方对人粪尿的利用还是一个薄弱环节，已经利用的仅占40％左右，特别是对人尿的利用就更差。这是一个值得注意解决的问题。要把人粪尿充分积攒、利用起来，首先应搞好厕所，做到不仅有公共厕所，而且有家庭厕所，使各种厕所都既卫生又便于积肥，同时应当尽可能作到队队有尿池，户户有尿罐，力争把人粪尿统统利用起来。冬季利用尿浇小麦，增产效果很大，各地可大力提倡和推行。至于土杂肥更是到处都有，各地应该广泛地发动群众，利用冬闲把可以做肥料的墙土、炕土、锅台土、破房土以及沟头、壕旁、村边、路旁的垃圾等，大量地搜集起来，用以垫圈或沤制。城镇中人粪尿的潜力也很大，可做肥料的垃圾、污水很多，城镇领导机关应该有计划有组织地开展送肥下乡，支援农业生产。（山东大众日报）
    积肥保肥用肥都要抓
    “三包”任务落实以后，生产小队就要从各个方面增加措施，争取超包产。现在应该在肥料上用劲。从我区目前肥料工作的实际情况来看，把劲应该用在如下三个环节上，即积肥、保肥、用肥。
    积肥。据了解，目前各地的积肥门路不下十几种，所有肥源都要充分利用。但是，也要有个主次之分。很多超产小队的经验证明：解决肥料问题的根本途径是养猪积肥。哪里的猪养得多，养得好，哪里的肥料关就过得快，粮食就增产。从解决肥料问题上来考虑，衡量一个地方养猪工作做得好坏，应该有两个指标：一是养了多少猪，二是积了多少肥。很多超产小队的经验还证明：在狠抓养猪积肥的同时，还要在面广、量大、肥效高的人粪尿上多用劲。目前有些地方人粪尿流失得比较厉害。各小队应有公共厕所，每户应有家庭厕所，这样就会减少人粪尿的流失。牛马粪、羊粪等圈肥也是个主要肥源，也要牢牢抓住。养猪积肥，积攒人粪尿，积好畜肥圈肥，这是目前解决肥料问题的几个主要方向，要用劲，就得在这三大肥源上用，才算把劲用到了节骨眼上。
    保肥，也很重要。有的地方过去有这样的习惯，把粪拉到田边，就堆放在那里，临播种时再撒粪。这样，任凭风吹日晒，肥料就没劲了。提早把粪送到田头，是十分必要的，特别是在土地分散的山区，必须赶早运肥。但是运肥一定要和保肥结合好，运到田头一定要用土密封好，不然好肥也会变成次肥。
    用肥，是整个肥料工作的最后一环。我们在施肥方法上，应该提倡沟施、穴施和拌种施肥、随耧施肥，这是充分发挥肥效和经济用肥的好办法。
