Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 9th: Romania's "Scânteia" published an editorial on December 7th entitled "Under the Invincible Banner of Marxism-Leninism," stating that the Moscow meeting, in terms of the breadth of participation and the importance of the issues discussed, was a historic international gathering in the development of the international communist movement, the struggle of the world's people for peace and socialism, and their destiny.

The editorial said that the profound democracy and complete equality that characterized the entire discussion process, as well as the contributions made by each party, guaranteed the formulation of this document of great theoretical and practical significance—the meeting's statement—which is the fruit of the collective wisdom of all communist and workers' parties, embodying a summary of the rich experience of the international communist movement.

Referring to the statement's description of the characteristics of the era, the editorial said that the statement's strength lies in the fact that it proceeds from the enormous changes taking place in the world, points out its path of development, and identifies the social forces that determine the development of events, helping the communist parties of various countries scientifically formulate their struggle goals and develop corresponding tactics and strategies.

The editorial then described the overall crisis facing the capitalist world and the flourishing scene presented by the world socialist system.

The editorial said that the communist and workers' parties of all countries protect the unity of the socialist camp as they would protect the apple of their eye—this is the main source of strength for every socialist country, a guarantee for defending peace, and a powerful driving force for social progress throughout the world.

In discussing the issue of defending peace, the editorial pointed out that the communist parties' belief in preventing the possibility of a world war does not stem from denying the aggressive nature of imperialism, which has not changed. Facts show that the imperialists, especially the main aggressive force—U.S. imperialism—are pursuing a policy of war preparations, adhering to the arms race, especially the thermo-nuclear arms race, and constantly attempting to create new hotbeds of war, pushing the world towards the disaster of a world war. However, imperialism and its aggressive plans are met with opposition from a tremendous force led by the socialist camp, a force capable of preventing war, crushing the conspiracies of imperialist aggressors to push humanity into a new world war, and conducting an effective struggle against the local wars launched by the imperialists.

The editorial believes that under the conditions of a world divided into two systems, the only correct principle in international relations is the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems.

The editorial continued, as long as the forces of peace act unitedly and resolutely, they can crush the stubborn resistance of the imperialists, increasingly isolate the militarist blocs, and force them to accept an agreement on general disarmament.

The editorial said that the Moscow meeting discussed the development of the national liberation movement in many ways, a movement that is changing the face of the contemporary world and is an integral part of the world socialist revolution.

The editorial said that the independence of the newly liberated countries is the result of the struggle of the people of these countries against the imperialists—either through the armed path of national liberation war, the progressive and revolutionary importance of which the communists have always recognized, or through non-military means.

The editorial said that the meeting discussed the issue of further safeguarding the purity of Marxism-Leninism, "arming the communist and workers' parties of all countries in the struggle against revisionism, the main danger in the workers' movement, which needs to be continued in the future. Continuing to deeply expose the Yugoslav revisionist version is a necessary task for the communist and workers' parties."

The editorial added that, at the same time, the meeting also pointed out the harmfulness of dogmatism and sectarianism, which, if not fought perseveringly, can become the main danger.

The editorial pointed out that the November meeting marked a new strengthening of the unity of the international communist movement, based on common goals and the interests of the working class, and based on the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism.

The editorial said that the fact that the glorious Soviet Communist Party, a long-tested party, is at the forefront of the international communist movement is a source of great strength for the international communist movement.

The editorial concluded that in the history of the workers' movement, the Moscow meeting will be an event of great significance, and its documents have programmatic and decisive significance for the entire struggle of the communist parties of our time. Along with other communist and workers' parties, our party, under the leadership of its Central Committee, will work tirelessly and make every effort to implement the ideas of the statement.

    共同行动的准则　加强团结的纲领
    在马克思列宁主义不可战胜的旗帜下
    罗马尼亚《火花报》12月7日社论摘要
    新华社布加勒斯特9日电　罗马尼亚《火花报》7日发表题为《在马克思列宁主义不可战胜的旗帜下》的社论说，从参加的广泛性和所讨论问题的重要性来说，莫斯科会议都是国际共产主义运动的发展、世界人民争取和平和社会主义的斗争和命运中的一次具有历史意义的国际会见。
    社论说，成为整个讨论过程中特点的深刻的民主，完全的平等以及每个党所作的贡献保证了这个具有巨大理论和实践意义的文件——会议声明——的制定，是所有共产党和工人党集体智慧的果实，它体现着国际共产主义运动丰富经验的总结。
    社论在谈到声明中所作的对时代特征的说明时说，声明的力量在于它是从世界上所发生的巨大变化出发的，指出了它的发展道路，并确定了决定事件发展的社会力量，帮助各国共产党科学地制定斗争目标和制定相应的策略和战略。
    社论接着叙述了资本主义世界所面临的总危机和世界社会主义体系所呈现的一片欣欣向荣景象。
    社论说，各国共产党和工人党像保护眼珠似地保护社会主义阵营的团结——这是每个社会主义国家力量的主要源泉，保卫和平的保证和全世界社会进步的强大动力。
    在谈到保卫和平问题时，社论指出，共产党对防止世界战争可能性的信念不是从否定帝国主义侵略本性出发的，这种本性没有改变。事实表明，帝国主义者，首先是主要侵略势力——美帝国主义推行着备战的政策，坚持军备竞赛，特别是热核军备，不断企图制造新的战争温床，把世界推向世界战争的灾难。但是帝国主义及其侵略计划遇到了以社会主义阵营为首的巨大的力量的反对，这种力量能够阻止战争，能够粉碎帝国主义侵略者把人类推向新世界战争的阴谋，能够进行有效地反对帝国主义者所发动的局部战争的斗争。
    社论认为，在世界分成两个体系的条件下，在国际关系中唯一正确的原则就是不同社会制度国家间和平共处的原则。
    社论又说，只要和平力量一致地和坚决地行动，就能够粉碎帝国主义者的顽固的反抗，就能够愈来愈孤立军国主义集团，并强迫它们接受普遍裁军协议。
    社论说，莫斯科会议多方面地讨论了发展民族解放运动问题，这个运动正改变着当代世界的面貌，是世界社会主义革命不可分割的一部分。
    社论说，新解放的国家的独立是这些国家人民反对帝国主义者斗争的果实——或者通过民族解放战争的武装道路，共产党人一向都承认这种战争的进步和革命的重要性，或者通过非军事道路。
    社论说，会议讨论了进一步保卫马克思列宁主义纯洁性的问题，“使各国共产党和工人党在今后需要继续进行的、反对作为工人运动中的主要危险的修正主义的斗争中武装起来。继续深入地揭露修正主义的南斯拉夫翻版是共产党和工人党的必要任务。”
    社论又说，同时，会议也指出了教条主义和宗派主义的有害性，如果不进行坚持不渝的斗争，教条主义和宗派主义可以成为主要的危险。
    社论指出，11月会议标志着基于共同的目标和工人阶级利益，基于马克思列宁主义学说的国际共产主义运动的团结有了新的加强。
    社论说，光荣的苏联共产党这样一个久经考验的党走在国际共产主义运动的前头，这个事实对国际共产主义运动来说是一个强大的力量的源泉。
    社论最后说，在工人运动史中，莫斯科会议将成为一个具有巨大意义的事件，它的文件对我们时代共产党的整个斗争具有纲领性的决定性意义。和其他共产党和工人党一起，我们党在其党中央的领导下，将为贯彻声明的思想坚持不懈地工作并尽一切努力。
