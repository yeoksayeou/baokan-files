    Learning Revolutionary Dialectics from the Thesis That All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers
    Wu Chuanqi
    Revolutionary dialectics is the soul of Marxism-Leninism and the spiritual weapon for the proletariat and revolutionary people to understand and transform the world. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On Contradiction": "The task of the Communists lies in exposing the fallacies of the reactionaries and the metaphysical way of thinking, in propagating the dialectics inherent in things, and in accelerating the transformation of things so as to achieve the goal of revolution." Comrade Mao Zedong's thesis that "all reactionaries are paper tigers" and the idea of strategically despising the enemy and tactically taking the enemy seriously are models for applying the materialist dialectical worldview and methodology to revolutionary struggle.
    In complex class struggles, especially at critical junctures of revolutionary struggles, how should we understand the comparative relationship between revolutionary and reactionary forces? How should we establish revolutionary strategic and tactical thinking? This issue has always been a major one in revolutionary struggles. In the comparative relationship between revolutionary and reactionary forces, there are always several contradictory aspects, sides, and factors. If we look at the problem in isolation and superficially, we will inevitably arrive at erroneous estimates. During the First Revolutionary Civil War, Chen Duxiu's right opportunism emerged; during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, "left" opportunism emerged; during the Anti-Japanese War, there were national capitulationists who clamored for "inevitable defeat in the war of resistance" and "inevitable defeat in further war"; during the Third Revolutionary Civil War, many people overestimated the strength of American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries and underestimated the strength of the Communist Party and the people. All these erroneous views, from an epistemological point of view, are manifestations of one-sidedness and subjectivity, and are expressions of the idealist and metaphysical worldview.
    How can we obtain a correct understanding? Comrade Mao Zedong said as early as 1927: "Educate Party members to use the method of Marxism-Leninism to analyze the political situation and estimate class forces, so as to replace subjective analysis and estimation." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol. 1, p. 94) The "method of Marxism-Leninism" mentioned here is materialist dialectics. Lenin said that dialectics is the epistemology of Marxism. He also said, "The splitting of a single entity into two parts and the cognition of its contradictory parts is the essence of dialectics." (Complete Works of Lenin, Vol. 38, p. 407) According to this view, all things in the world have a dual nature, and there is nothing in the world that cannot be analyzed, only the circumstances and nature are different. To concretely and realistically analyze the contradictions of the thing itself is the materialist dialectical worldview and methodology. To examine all social life phenomena in class society with this is the dialectics of class society history, that is, the method of class analysis.

     All Reactionaries Have the Dual Nature of Paper Tiger and Real Tiger
    All things in the world have a dual nature. Applying this fundamental viewpoint of dialectics to expose the inherent contradictions of imperialism and all reactionaries is to point out that they are both paper tigers and real tigers. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Like all things in the world, which invariably have a dual nature (i.e., the law of the unity of opposites), imperialism and all reactionaries have a dual nature too; they are real tigers and paper tigers at the same time." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol. 4, p. 1190. Hereinafter, all page numbers not otherwise indicated refer to this volume.)
    In response to those erroneous ideas that overestimate the reactionary forces and underestimate the revolutionary forces, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality they are not so powerful. From a long-term point of view, the truly powerful forces do not belong to the reactionaries, but to the people." (p. 1193) Here, all reactionaries being paper tigers is spoken of from the point of view of essence, development, and long-term, and in comparison with the truly powerful people's forces. On the other hand, in terms of the dual nature of imperialism and all reactionaries themselves, it refers to their temporary strength, that is, to the real tiger aspect of them. That is to say, to reveal the contradictions between things from the interconnectedness of things; to enter the interior of things from their surface, and reveal the essence of things.
    Being outwardly strong but inwardly weak is the characteristic of imperialism and all reactionaries, and it is also a manifestation of their dual nature. During the Third Revolutionary Civil War, when the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a counter-revolutionary war with the support of American imperialism, it could be said that they possessed the most powerful military force from an outward appearance. However, from a political and essential point of view, it was also their weakest period. Their launching of a reactionary war made them even more detached from the people. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in "The Present Situation and Our Tasks": "At that time, we said that the superiority of Chiang Kai-shek's military strength was only a temporary phenomenon, only a factor that played a temporary role; the assistance of American imperialism was also only a factor that played a temporary role; the anti-popular nature of Chiang Kai-shek's war and the attitude of the people were factors that played a constant role; and in this respect, the People's Liberation Army had the advantage." (p. 1246) In terms of the factors that play a constant role, "the nature of the war determines the relationship between the government and the people, which is a historical principle." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol. 2, p. 375) The Kuomintang reactionaries represented the comprador-feudal relations of production, and they were the concentrated manifestation of imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capitalism. The war launched by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang was an anti-popular war. Because of the reactionary perverse actions of the reactionaries, more than 90% of the people in the country opposed them, and this is the essence of the problem, and it is the basis for why they must be realistically regarded as paper tigers. This factor, which plays a constant role, increasingly promotes the transformation of the reactionaries into paper tigers. On the other hand, we represent the nascent and progressive relations of production, and our war is a just war. This progress and reaction determine the attitude of the people, which in turn determines where the truly powerful forces lie, and determines that the nascent forces will surely defeat the decadent forces.
    Those who only see the factors that play a temporary role and exaggerate them as determining the entire course of events are "weaponry-only theory" advocates in the war issue. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out as early as "On Protracted War": "Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor; the decisive factor is people, not things. The comparison of strength is not only a comparison of military and economic power, but also a comparison of manpower and popular sentiment. Military and economic power must be mastered by people." The "weaponry-only theory" advocates only see one factor of "military and economic power" and regard it as the whole, while they do not see this decisive factor of "manpower and popular sentiment." In fact, all revolutionary wars have been fought by revolutionary armies with inferior weapons defeating counter-revolutionary armies with superior weapons. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "What we rely on is nothing more than millet plus rifles, but history will ultimately prove that this millet plus rifles is stronger than Chiang Kai-shek's airplanes plus tanks." (p. 1193) And this point has long been finally proven by history. The "weaponry-only theory" advocates only see one aspect of things, which is their one-sidedness; to exaggerate this one-sided thing and regard it as the whole, this is their subjectivity.

      The Dual Nature of Reactionaries Reflects
        Their Internal Irreconcilable Contradictions
    In the course of social development, the process of the transformation of all exploiting classes from progress to reaction is also the process of transformation from real tigers to paper tigers. The decisive factor for this transformation is the power of the people. Comrade Mao Zedong analyzed: "Historically, the slave-owning class, the feudal landlord class, and the bourgeoisie, before they seized power and for a period after they seized power, were vigorous, revolutionary, advanced, and real tigers. In the subsequent period, due to their opposites, the slave class, the peasant class, and the proletariat, gradually grew stronger and struggled with them more and more fiercely, they gradually transformed in the opposite direction, turning into reactionaries, turning into backward people, turning into paper tigers, and eventually were or will be overthrown by the people." (p. 1190) When these classes still represent progressive relations of production and reflect the requirements of liberating and developing productive forces, they were once real tigers. Conversely, when they are transformed into representatives of decadent relations of production, they become the objects of revolution, they will be defeated by the new forces, and they will be overthrown by the people. They become paper tigers. This is because there is an antagonistic contradiction between the decadent relations of production represented by the reactionaries and the liberation and development of productive forces.
    Comrade Mao Zedong continued to analyze: All reactionary classes also have this dual nature when faced with the people's do-or-die struggle, "On the one hand, real tigers, eating people, eating millions upon millions of people. The people's cause of struggle is in an era of hardship and difficulty, and there are many winding roads. The Chinese people spent more than a hundred years and died probably tens of millions of people in order to eliminate the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China before they achieved victory in 1949. Look, isn't this a living tiger, an iron tiger, a real tiger? However, they eventually turned into paper tigers, dead tigers, tofu tigers. This is a historical fact." (p. 1190) The decisive factor for this latter transformation is still the power of the people. But here, two concepts must be distinguished. The above-mentioned transformation of all exploiting classes from progress to reaction, that is, the transformation from real tigers to paper tigers in this sense, is spoken of from the entire historical process, from a strategic point of view; as for when these classes have already transformed into reactionaries, from a strategic point of view, they are already paper tigers, but from a tactical point of view, they still have their real tiger aspect. Therefore, the process of transformation from real tigers to paper tigers in this sense is the process of the reactionaries being gradually eliminated. That is to say, the content of the former dual nature is with regard to the transformation of the exploiting classes from revolutionaries to reactionaries; the content of the latter dual nature is with regard to the factors that play a temporary role and the factors that play a constant role for the reactionaries. Thus, as real tigers, the former is with regard to their having been revolutionaries, and the latter is with regard to the factors that play a temporary role for the reactionaries; the former is with regard to strategy, and the latter is with regard to tactics. In short, the content of the dual nature between the former and the latter is different.
    From this dual nature of all reactionaries, the more reactionary they are, the more they will become detached from the people, and the more they will transform towards the paper tiger aspect until they are overthrown by the people. On the other hand, the closer they are to death, the more they will carry out their dying struggle. They will neither automatically withdraw from the stage of history nor change their reactionary class nature. As long as they have power and possibility, they will make trouble with the people to the end, and they will eat people. So in this respect, they are real tigers again.
    The dual nature of imperialism and all reactionaries as both paper tigers and real tigers reflects the irreconcilable contradictions within them, which is the contradiction of class antagonism within society manifested in them. To not see or not recognize that they are essentially nothing more than a paper tiger, and to not see that the truly powerful forces are on the side of the people, is a manifestation of one-sidedness, superficiality, and subjectivity, and is idealism and metaphysics. To guide the revolution with this is the mistake of Chen Duxiu's right opportunism during the First Revolutionary Civil War. Conversely, if their real tiger aspect is ignored, and thus a rash attitude is adopted in the specific struggle, this is also one-sidedness. To guide the revolution with this is the mistake of the "left" adventurism during the Second Revolutionary Civil War. According to the metaphysical viewpoint, this unity of opposites of the paper tiger and the real tiger of the reactionaries is incomprehensible because the metaphysical mind only knows how to look at problems with the ideological formula of "yes is yes, no is no, and anything else is nonsense." They do not understand that the law of the unity of opposites is the fundamental law of the universe, they do not look at the dual nature of things, and they do not understand that "contradiction is motion, is thing, is process, and is also thought." (On Contradiction), so they always make themselves fall into the error of one-sidedness, "And whether it is 'left' or right, it is unfavorable to the revolution and only beneficial to the counter-revolution." (Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party). Contrary to the one-sidedness and subjectivity of all opportunism, Comrade Mao Zedong always studies dialectics for the people's revolutionary struggle and always creatively applies Marxist-Leninist dialectics to solve China's revolutionary problems. In extremely difficult circumstances, he pointed out the bright future, and in extremely complex situations, he pointed out the clear direction. Under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolution always achieves the goal of victory.

    The Unity of Opposites Between Strategically Despising the Enemy and Tactically Taking the Enemy Seriously
    Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On practice": "The problem of Marxism is not merely to understand the laws of the objective world and thereby be able to explain it, but to apply the knowledge of these laws actively to change the world." Then, our knowledge of this law of imperialism and all reactionaries lies in: "Essentially, in the long term, and strategically, we must realistically regard imperialism and all reactionaries as paper tigers. On this point, we establish our strategic thinking. On the other hand, they are living, iron, and real tigers, and they will eat people. On this point, we establish our tactical thinking and tactical thinking." (p. 1190) Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong also said: "In order to fight against the enemy, we have formed a concept over a long period of time, that is, strategically we must despise all enemies, and tactically we must take all enemies seriously." (Speech at the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries held in Moscow in 1957) This dialectic of strategically despising the enemy and tactically taking the enemy seriously is a correct reflection of objective dialectics in people's thinking. Comrade Mao Zedong's thought and theory are a materialistic and comprehensive reflection of objective truth. It is a major development of the Marxist-Leninist strategic and tactical theory and is also a new contribution to revolutionary dialectics. It is under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist strategic and tactical theory that the Chinese people have defeated seemingly powerful enemies and won the victory of the revolution.
    Between strategically despising the enemy and tactically taking the enemy seriously is the unity of opposites. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out during the Third Revolutionary Civil War: "The rule of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group in China is already rotten and has no future. We have reason to despise them, and we have the assurance and confidence to defeat all enemies at home and abroad of the Chinese people. But in every part and on every specific issue of struggle (whether military, political, economic or ideological), we must in no circumstances despise the enemy but, on the contrary, must take him seriously and concentrate all our efforts on fighting to win victory. When we correctly point out that, in the whole and strategically, we should despise the enemy, we must in no circumstances despise him in every part and on every specific issue." (p. 1267) That is to say, strategically despising the enemy and tactically taking the enemy seriously are interdependent and are two aspects of the same thing. Strategically despising the enemy must be guaranteed by tactically taking the enemy seriously, and tactically taking the enemy seriously must be premised on strategically despising the enemy. If the enemy is not strategically despised, then the so-called tactically taking the enemy seriously will become fear of the enemy. Conversely, if the enemy is not tactically taken seriously, then the so-called strategically despising the enemy will become rash. According to dialectics, due to this unity of opposites of the paper tiger and real tiger of the objective object, the unity of opposites of the revolutionary strategy and tactics is stipulated, that is, it is stipulated that it must be both strategically despising the enemy and tactically taking the enemy seriously.
    In this unity of opposites of despising and valuing, strategically despising the enemy is the dominant aspect, and tactics serve strategy and guarantee its realization. In the face of a seemingly powerful enemy, if we do not dare to strategically despise them and do not dare to make revolution, we have made a fundamental mistake. Chen Duxiu's right opportunism during the First Revolutionary Civil War was that he regarded the enemy's strength as remarkable, succumbed to the pressure of the reactionaries, and did not dare to strategically despise them, and as a result, he lost the fruits of the revolution completely. On the other hand, the "left" opportunists who did not tactically take the enemy seriously pinned their hopes on miracles, were unwilling to do the hard and long-term revolutionary struggle, and attempted to achieve the complete victory of the revolution in one morning with a one-shot gamble. Because they did not truly believe in the power of the people either, some people who had committed "left" mistakes during the Second Revolutionary Civil War turned to committing right mistakes in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War. Because they did not believe in the power of the masses, they only felt that the Kuomintang, which was forced to temporarily resist Japan at that time, had a powerful force, and thus underestimated the role of the guerrilla warfare led by the Communist Party in the Anti-Japanese War, and erroneously believed that the victory of the Anti-Japanese War must rely on the Kuomintang, and advocated unifying the people's armed forces, anti-Japanese base areas, and people's organizations with the Kuomintang. However, they showed the thought of underestimating the enemy on the issue of the Anti-Japanese War, believing that Japan was not worth fighting, and fantasizing about relying on the Kuomintang army to seek "quick victory." These two one-sided performances came from the same source, which was not believing in the power of the people and believing in the Kuomintang more than believing in the masses. It can be seen from this that if we do not firmly believe in the power of the revolutionary masses, we cannot stand firm on the proletarian position and avoid wavering.
    Comrade Mao Zedong's dialectical thought is a spiritual condition for defeating the reactionaries and doing all revolutionary work well
    Marxist dialectics runs through the thorough revolutionary spirit. The proletarian revolutionaries despise all enemies in the whole and strategically, despise imperialism and all reactionaries, and thoroughly break with the entire old world, all of which are concrete manifestations of this fearless revolutionary spirit. The Marxist-Leninists' spirit of daring to make revolution and daring to struggle is because they have recognized the objective laws of social development, represent the interests of the people, and believe in the power of the people. One hundred and twelve years ago, when Marx and Engels published the "Communist Manifesto," there were only a few communists with bare hands, but they declared war on the entire old world with a heroic revolutionary spirit:
  "Let the ruling classes tremble at a communist revolution." Decades later, in Russia and China, what started as only communist groups of dozens of people, through the struggle of those who went before and were followed by others, gradually changed from small to large, and finally overthrew all seemingly powerful reactionaries. Today, the situation in the entire world is already "not the West wind prevailing over the East wind, but the East wind prevailing over the West wind." The socialist forces have already taken an overwhelming advantage over the forces of imperialism, and the rampant and domineering actions of the imperialists are forcing more than 90% of the people in the world to rise up and attack them. Their life expectancy will not be very long. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "There are contradictions between the new and old aspects of everything, forming a series of tortuous struggles. As a result of the struggle, the new aspect changes from small to large and rises to be the dominant thing, while the old aspect changes from large to small and gradually becomes something that is doomed to extinction." (On Contradiction) Comrade Mao Zedong's thought is the spiritual condition for defeating imperialism and all reactionaries and promoting this transformation of contradictions.
    Comrade Mao Zedong's thought has a very significant universal significance. It is not only applicable to the struggle against the enemy, but also to the struggle on the economic construction front; it is not only applicable to revolutionary military struggle and political struggle, but also to all revolutionary work, and is used to overcome all difficulties on the road of advancement. Comrade Mao Zedong's thought is also the spiritual condition for us to overcome the difficulties in our advance and do all revolutionary work well.
    Before us, the future is always bright, and the road is often tortuous. During the Third Revolutionary Civil War, Comrade Mao Zedong often used this spirit to educate cadres, that is, to teach people to always see the dual nature of things' development. The future is bright because we are an emerging force with a bright future. Contrary to the difficulties encountered by all reactionaries, there are no insurmountable difficulties before us. As long as we believe in the Party and believe in the masses, there are no insurmountable difficulties. Therefore, in development, in the whole, and strategically, we must regard all difficulties as paper tigers, and strategically, we must despise difficulties. On the other hand, the road is tortuous, and there will always be many obstacles and many difficulties on the road of revolution, so we must always fully recognize difficulties, imagine difficulties, analyze difficulties, and have ideological preparations to cope with all possibilities. Do not covet cheapness and fantasize about winning by luck. Therefore, in specific work, locally, and tactically, we must take difficulties seriously and treat all difficulties as real tigers. "Ten thousand rivers and mountains are nothing," revolutionaries are never afraid of seemingly powerful enemies, and they are never afraid of any temporary difficulties, they are always full of confidence and soaring energy. On the other hand, in all specific struggles and all practical work, we always complete all specific tasks in a down-to-earth spirit of hard work and meticulousness. This is also the style of Marxist-Leninist revolutionaries who combine abundant revolutionary enthusiasm with calm scientific analysis.
    In short, Comrade Mao Zedong's strategic and tactical thought is the most complete and profound dialectical thought. It is a thought weapon against all opportunism and various one-sided mistakes, and it is the spiritual condition for us to achieve the goal of victory in all revolutionary struggles. This thought always radiates the light of victory and is always the guiding light on our road forward.

    从一切反动派都是纸老虎的论断学习革命的辩证法
    吴传启
    革命的辩证法，是马克思列宁主义的灵魂，是无产阶级和革命人民认识世界和改造世界的精神武器。毛泽东同志在《矛 盾论》中说：“共产党人的任务就在于揭露反动派和形而上学的错误思想，宣传事物的本来的辩证法，促成事物的转化，达到革命的目的。”毛泽东同志的“一切反动派都是纸老虎”的论断和战略上藐视敌人、战术上重视敌人的思想，是把唯物辩证法世界观、方法论运用在革命斗争中的典范。
    在复杂的阶级斗争中，特别是在革命斗争的严重关头，怎样认识革命力量同反动力量的对比关系？怎样建立革命的战略思想和策略思想？这个问题历来是革命斗争中的一个大问题。在革命力量同反动力量的对比关系中，总是存在着若干个矛盾着的方面、侧面和因素，如果孤立地、表面地看问题，当然就要得出错误的估计。第一次国内革命战争时期出现过陈独秀的右倾机会主义，第二次国内革命战争时期出现过“左”倾机会主义，抗日战争时期有高嚷“抗战必亡”和“再战必亡”的民族投降主义者，在第三次国内革命战争时期，也曾经有许多人过高地估计了美帝国主义的和国民党反动派的力量，过低地估计了共产党和人民的力量：所有这些错误观点，从认识论上看，都是片面性、主观性的表现，都是唯心论、形而上学的世界观的表现。
    怎样才能得到正确的认识，毛泽东同志在1927年就说过：“教育党员用马克思列宁主义的方法去作政治形势的分析和阶级势力的估量，以代替主观主义的分析和估量。”（《毛泽东选集》第一卷，九十四页）这里说的“马克思列宁主义的方法”，就是唯物辩证法。列宁说，辩证法，也就是马克思主义的认识论。又说，“统一物之分为两个部分以及对它的矛盾着的部分的认识，是辩证法的实质。”（《列宁全集》，三十八卷，四○七页）按照这个观点，世界上一切事物无不具有两重性，世界上没有不能分析的事物，只是情况不同和性质不同而已。具体地如实地分析事物本身的矛盾，就是唯物辩证法的世界观和方法论。以此考察阶级社会的一切社会生活现象，就是阶级社会历史的辩证法，也就是阶级分析的方法。
     一切反动派都有纸老虎和真老虎的两重性
    世界上一切事物无不具有两重性，应用这个辩证法的根本观点去揭露帝国主义和一切反动派本来的矛盾，这就是指出它们是纸老虎又是真老虎。毛泽东同志说：“同世界上一切事物无不具有两重性（即对立统一规律）一样，帝国主义和一切反动派也有两重性，它们是真老虎又是纸老虎。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷，一一九○页。以下凡不注出处，只注页码的，均指本书）
    针对那些对反动力量估计过高和对革命力量估计不足的错误思想，毛泽东同志指出：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”（一一九三页）在这里，一切反动派都是纸老虎，是从本质上、发展上和长远的观点上说的，是同真正强大的人民力量的对比而言的。另一方面，就帝国主义和一切反动派自身的两重性来说，又是对于它们的暂时的力量，即对于它们的真老虎的一面而言的。也就是说，从事物相互联系中，揭露事物之间的矛盾；从事物的表面进入它的内部，揭出事物的本质。
    外强中干，是帝国主义和一切反动派的特征，也是它们的两重性的表现。在第三次国内革命战争时期，当国民党反动派在美帝国主义支持下发动反革命战争的时候，从外貌上看，可以说是他们拥有军事力量的最强大的时期。可是从政治上、从本质上看，又是他们最虚弱的时期。他们发动了反动战争，就使他们更加脱离人民。毛泽东同志在《目前形势和我们的任务》中指出：“那时，我们说，蒋介石军事力量的优势，只是暂时的现象，只是临时起作用的因素；美国帝国主义的援助，也只是临时起作用的因素；蒋介石战争的反人民的性质，人心的向背则是经常起作用的因素；而在这方面，人民解放军则占着优势。”（一二四六页）就经常起作用的因素来说，“战争的性质决定政府和人民的关系，这是一个历史的原则。”（《毛泽东选集》第二卷，三七五页）国民党反动派所代表的是买办的封建的生产关系，他们是帝国主义、封建势力和官僚资本主义的集中表现。蒋介石匪帮发动的战争是反人民的战争。由于反动派的倒行逆施，迫使全国90％以上的人都反对他们，这就是问题的实质，就是为什么必须如实地把他们看作纸老虎的根据。这种经常起作用的因素，日益促使反动派向纸老虎方面转化。另一方面，我们是代表新生的，进步的生产关系的，我们的战争是正义战争。这种进步和反动就决定了人心向背，由此也就决定了真正强大的力量在哪一边，就决定了新生力量一定战胜腐朽力量。
    那些只看见临时起作用的因素，并把它夸大为决定事变整个进程的人们，就是战争问题上的“唯武器论”者。毛泽东同志早在《论持久战》中就指出说：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。力量对比不但是军力和经济力的对比，而且是人力和人心的对比。军力和经济力是要人去掌握的。”“唯武器论”者就是只看见“军力和经济力”的一个因素，并把它当作全体，而看不见“人力和人心”的这个决定的因素。实际上，从来的革命战争都是拿劣武器的革命军队打败拿好武器的反革命军队的。所以毛泽东同志说：“我们所依靠的不过是小米加步枪，但是历史最后将证明，这小米加步枪比蒋介石的飞机加坦克还要强些。”（一一九三页）而这一点是早已为历史所最后证明了。“唯武器论”者只看见事情的一个方面，这是他们的片面性；把这种片面的东西夸大起来看成全体，这是他们的主观性。
      反动派的这种两重性表现了
        他们内部的不可克服的矛盾
    在社会发展的进程中，一切剥削阶级的从进步转化为反动的过程，也就是从真老虎转化为纸老虎的过程。对于这种转化起决定作用的因素，就是人民群众的力量。毛泽东同志分析说：“历史上奴隶主阶级、封建地主阶级和资产阶级，在它们取得统治权力以前和取得统治权力以后的一段时间内，它们是生气勃勃的，是革命者，是先进者，是真老虎。在随后一段时间，由于它们的对立面，奴隶阶级、农民阶级和无产阶级，逐步壮大，并同它们进行斗争，越来越厉害，它们就逐步向反面转化，化为反动派，化为落后的人们，化为纸老虎，终究被或者将被人民所推翻。”（一一九○页）当这些阶级还代表进步的生产关系，还反映解放生产力和发展生产力的要求的时候，它们曾经是真老虎。反之，当它们转化为腐朽的生产关系的代表者，它们就成了革命的对象，它们就要被新生力量战而胜之，就要为人民群众所推翻。它们就变成了纸老虎。这就因为反动派所代表的腐朽的生产关系同生产力的解放和发展之间，存在着对抗性的矛盾。
  毛泽东同志继续分析说：一切反动阶级在其面临人民的决死斗争的时候，也还有这种两重性，“一面，真老虎，吃人，成百万人成千万人地吃。人民斗争事业处在艰难困苦的时代，出现许多弯弯曲曲的道路。中国人民为了消灭帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的统治，花了一百多年时间，死了大概几千万人之多，才取得一九四九年的胜利。你看，这不是活老虎，铁老虎，真老虎吗？但是，它们终究转化成了纸老虎，死老虎，豆腐老虎。这是历史的事实。”（一一九○页）对于这后一种转化起决定作用的，仍然是人民群众的力量。但在这里，必须把两种概念区别开来。上述一切剥削阶级的从进步向反动的转化，即在这个意义上的从真老虎向纸老虎的转化，是从整个历史过程上、从战略上而言的；至于当这些阶级已经转化为反动派的时候，从战略上看它们已经是纸老虎，可是从战术上看，它们还有其真老虎的一面。因此这个意义上的从真老虎向纸老虎的转化过程，即是反动派逐步被消灭的过程。也就是说，前一种两重性的内容是就剥削阶级之从革命派转化为反动派而言的；后一种两重性的内容是就对反动派临时起作用的因素和经常起作用的因素而言的。从而作为真老虎，前者是就其曾经是革命者而言的，后者是就对反动派暂时起作用的因素而言的；前者是就战略而言的，后者是就战术而言的。总之，这里前后之间的两重性的内容是不同的。
    从一切反动派的这种两重性来说，当他们越是反动，就越要脱离人民，就越是向纸老虎方面转化，直至被人民群众推翻。另一方面，他们越是濒于死亡，就越是要进行其垂死的挣扎。他们既不会自动退出历史舞台，也不会改变其反动的阶级本性。只要他们还有力量，还有可能，他们就要同人民捣乱到底，他们就要吃人。所以就这方面来说，他们又是真老虎。
    帝国主义和一切反动派是纸老虎又是真老虎的两重性，表现了它们内部的不可克服的矛盾，是社会内部的阶级对抗表现在它们身上的矛盾。看不见或者不承认它们在本质上不过是一个纸老虎，看不见真正强大的力量在人民一边，是片面性、表面性、主观性的表现，是唯心论和形而上学。以此指导革命，就是第一次国内革命战争时期的陈独秀右倾机会主义的错误。反之，如果忽视了它们的真老虎的一面，因而在具体斗争中采取轻率的态度，也是片面性。以此指导革命，就是第二次国内革命战争时期的“左”倾冒险主义的错误。按照形而上学观点，反动派的这种纸老虎和真老虎的对立统一，是不可以理解的，因为形而上学的头脑只知道用“是则是，否则否，除此以外即是鬼话”的思想公式看问题。他们不懂得对立统一规律是宇宙间的根本规律，不去看事物的两重性，不懂得“矛盾即是运动，即是事物，即是过程，也即是思想。”（矛盾论），因此他们总是使自己陷入片面性的错误，“而无论是‘左’倾或右倾，都是不利于革命而仅仅利于反革命的。”（《关于若干历史问题的决议》）。同一切机会主义的片面性、主观性相反，毛泽东同志总是为人民的革命斗争而研究辩证法，总是创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的辩证法，解决中国的革命问题。在极端困难的环境中，指出光明的前途，在十分复杂的情况下，指出明确的方向。在毛泽东思想的旗帜下，革命总是达到胜利的目的。
    战略上藐视敌人和战术上
    重视敌人的对立统一
    毛泽东同志在《实践论》中说：“马克思主义的哲学认为十分重要的问题，不在于懂得了客观世界的规律性，因而能够解释世界，而在于拿了这种对于客观规律性的认识去能动地改造世界。”那末，我们拿了对于帝国主义和一切反动派的这种规律性的认识就在于：“从本质上看，从长期上看，从战略上看，必须如实地把帝国主义和一切反动派，都看成纸老虎。从这点上，建立我们的战略思想。另一方面，它们又是活的铁的真的老虎，它们会吃人的。从这点上，建立我们的策略思想和战术思想。”（一一九○页）因此毛泽东同志又说：“为了同敌人作斗争，我们在一个长时间内形成了一个概念，就是说，在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人。”（1957年在莫斯科召开的社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议上的发言）这个战略上藐视敌人和战术上重视敌人的辩证法，是客观辩证法在人们思维中的正确反映。毛泽东同志的这个思想、理论，就是唯物地、全面地反映了客观真理。它是对马克思列宁主义战略策略理论的重大发展，也是对革命辩证法的新的贡献。我国人民正是在毛泽东同志的这个马克思列宁主义的战略策略理论的指导下，战胜了貌似强大的敌人，取得了革命的胜利。
    在战略上藐视敌人和在战术上重视敌人之间，是对立面的统一。毛泽东同志在第三次国内革命战争时期指出：“全世界帝国主义和中国蒋介石反动集团的统治，已经腐烂，没有前途。我们有理由轻视它们，我们有把握、有信心战胜中国人民的一切内外敌人。但是在每一个局部上，在每一个具体斗争问题上（不论是军事的、政治的、经济的或思想的斗争），却又决不可轻视敌人，相反，应当重视敌人，集中全力作战，方能取得胜利。当着我们正确地指出在全体上，在战略上，应当轻视敌人的时候，却决不可在每一个局部上，在每一个具体问题上，也轻视敌人。”（一二六七页）就是说，战略上藐视敌人同战术上重视敌人是互相依存的，是一件事的两方面。战略上的藐视敌人必须以战术上的重视敌人为保证，战术上的重视敌人必须以战略上的藐视敌人为前提。如果不是从战略上藐视敌人，则所谓战术上的重视敌人，就会成为恐敌了。反之，如果不在战术上重视敌人，则所谓战略上的藐视敌人，就会成为轻率了。按照辩证法，由于客观对象的这种纸老虎和真老虎的对立统一，就规定了革命的战略和战术的这种对立面的统一，即规定了必须是既要在战略上藐视敌人，又要在战术上重视敌人。
    在这个藐视重视的对立统一中，战略上藐视敌人是主导方面，战术是服从战略并保证它的实现的。在貌似强大的敌人面前，如果不敢在战略上藐视他们，不敢革命，就从根本上犯了错误。第一次国内革命战争时期的陈独秀右倾机会主义，就是把敌人力量看得了不起，屈服于反动派的压力，不敢在战略上藐视他们，结果把革命的果实丧失干净。另一方面，在战术上不重视敌人，不采取慎重态度，当正是需要采取正确政策去孤立反动派的时候，却采取错误政策孤立了自己，这就是第二次国内革命战争时期的“左”倾机会主义的错误，这种错误也使革命遭到了严重损失。
    这种藐视重视的辩证法应用在军事斗争上，就是“以一当十”和“以十当一”的对立的统一。毛泽东同志早在《中国革命战争的战略问题》中指出：“我们是以少胜多的——我们向整个中国统治者这样说。我们又是以多胜少的——我们向战场上作战的各个局部的敌人这样说。”（《毛泽东选集》第一卷二二二页）又说：“我们的战略是‘以一当十’，我们的战术是‘以十当一’，这是我们制胜敌人的根本法则之一。”（同上书，二二○页）“以少胜多”和“以一当十”是对整个敌人而言的，从这方面说，把敌人当纸老虎打；“以多胜少”和“以十当一”是对各个局部的敌人而言的，在这一方面，把敌人当真老虎打。我们可以而且必须坚决、彻底、干净地消灭全部阶级敌人，但是，没有量变就不会引起质变，吃饭只能一口一口地吃，打仗只能一仗一仗地打，不把一个一个局部的敌人消灭，就不能把整个敌人消灭掉。这样，在各个具体战场上，对于一部分一部分的敌人，必须在战术上重视它。毛泽东同志总是教导人们不打无准备的仗，不打无把握的仗，集中绝对优势的兵力，各个歼灭。“实行这种方法，就会胜利。违背这种方法，就会失败。”（一一九六页）从一部分一部分地消灭敌人达到消灭整个敌人，从量变引导到质变。毛泽东同志就是这样教导我们的：“任何质量都表现为一定的数量，没有数量也就没有质量。”（一四四三页）第三次国内革命战争时期到了“辽沈战役”后，人民解放军不仅在质量上早占优势，而且在数量上也已占优势了。毛泽东同志就指出“中国的军事形势现已进入一个新的转折点，即战争双方力量对比已经发生了根本的变化。”（一三六三页）把一个一个局部的敌人消灭，夺取一个一个的胜利的思想贯彻到底，则既不会因为敌人的貌似强大而惧怕它，因而不敢革命，也不会因为我们的胜利和敌人的失败而麻痹大意，放松警惕。
      “一切反动派都是纸老虎”的论断同战略上藐视敌人和战术上重视敌人的思想，是建立在坚定地相信人民力量的基础上的。正是在这一观点上，产生了马克思列宁主义同一切机会主义的根本分歧。不坚定地相信人民的力量和不忠实于无产阶级革命的利益，则是一切机会主义错误的阶级根源。不敢在战略上藐视敌人的陈独秀，就是不相信人民的力量，他相信资产阶级超过相信无产阶级，因而在革命的紧要关头，不去支持和继续发展群众运动来推进革命，而是幻想用让步和妥协来“挽救革命”。不在战术上重视敌人的“左”倾机会主义者，则是寄希望于奇迹，不愿做艰苦的长期的革命斗争，企图以孤注之一掷的方法在一个早上就取得革命的完全胜利。因为他们也不是真正地相信人民的力量，所以有的人在第二次国内革命战争时期犯过“左”倾错误以后，在抗日战争初期又转而犯了右倾错误。由于他们不相信群众的力量，只感觉当时被迫暂时抗日的国民党有强大的力量，因而低估共产党领导的游击战争在抗日战争中的作用，错误地认为抗日战争的胜利必须依靠国民党，主张把人民武装、抗日根据地和人民团体都统一于国民党。可是他们在抗日战争问题上，又表现轻敌思想，认为日本不值一打，幻想依靠国民党军队求得“速胜”。这两种片面的表现，同出一源，就是不相信人民的力量，相信国民党超过了相信群众。由此可见，如果不是坚定地相信革命群众的力量，就不能站稳无产阶级的立场而避免摇摆。
  毛泽东同志的这个辩证思想是战胜反动派
      和做好一切革命工作的精神条件
    马克思主义的辩证法贯穿着彻底的革命精神。无产阶级革命者在全体上、战略上藐视一切敌人，藐视帝国主义和一切反动派，同整个旧世界实行彻底决裂，都是这种大无畏的革命精神的具体体现。马克思列宁主义者的这种敢于革命和敢于斗争的精神，是因为他们认识了社会发展的客观规律，代表了人民群众的利益，相信人民群众的力量。距今一百一十二年以前，当马克思、恩格斯发表《共产党宣言》的时候，只有少数赤手空拳的共产主义者，却以豪迈的革命气概向整个旧世界宣战：
  “让那些统治阶级在共产主义革命面前发抖吧。”再过几十年以后，在俄国和中国，开始不过是几十人的共产主义小组，经过前仆后继的斗争，逐渐由小变大，终于推翻了一切貌似强大的反动派。今天，整个世界的局面已经“不是西风压倒东风，而是东风压倒西风”了。社会主义力量对于帝国主义的力量已经占了压倒的优势，帝国主义者的横行霸道，正迫使全世界90％以上的人正在或者将要对他们群起而攻之。他们的寿命不会很长了。毛泽东同志说：“任何事物的内部都有其新旧两个方面的矛盾，形成为一系列的曲折的斗争。斗争的结果，新的方面由小变大，上升为支配的东西，旧的方面则由大变小，变成逐步归于灭亡的东西。”（《矛盾论》）毛泽东同志的这个思想就是战胜帝国主义和一切反动派，以促进这种矛盾的转化的精神条件。
    毛泽东同志的这个思想是具有十分重大的普遍意义的，它不仅适用于对敌斗争，而且适用于经济建设战线上的斗争；不仅适用于革命的军事斗争、政治斗争，而且适用于一切革命工作，用来战胜一切前进道路上的困难。毛泽东同志的这个思想同时是我们战胜前进中的困难和做好一切革命工作的精神条件。
    在我们面前，前途总是光明的，道路又常常是曲折的。在第三次国内革命战争时期，毛泽东同志经常用这个精神教育干部，即教导人们总是要看到事物发展的两重性。前途是光明的，因为我们是新兴的有光明前途的势力，同一切反动派所遇到的困难相反，在我们面前没有不可克服的困难，只要相信党相信群众，就没有不可战胜的困难。所以我们在发展上、全体上、战略上，必须把一切困难看作纸老虎，在战略上必须藐视困难。另一方面，道路是曲折的，在革命的道路上总会有许多障碍物，总会有许多困难，因此又总是要充分地认识困难，设想困难，分析困难，要有应付各种可能的思想准备，不要贪图便宜，幻想侥幸取胜。所以在具体工作上、局部上、战术上，又必须重视困难，把一切困难当真老虎来打。“万水千山只等闲”，革命者从来不怕貌似强大的敌人，也从来不怕任何暂时的困难，总是信心百倍，干劲冲天。另一方面，在一切具体斗争上和一切实际工作中，又总是以埋头苦干的踏实精神，深入细致地完成一切具体任务。这也就是充沛的革命热情同冷静的科学分析相结合的马克思列宁主义的革命者的风格。
    总之，毛泽东同志的这个战略和战术思想，是最完整而深刻的辩证思想，是反对一切机会主义和各种片面性错误的思想武器，是我们在一切革命斗争中达到胜利目的的精神条件。这个思想永远放射着胜利的光芒，永远是我们前进道路上的指路明灯。
