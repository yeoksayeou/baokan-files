Hungary possesses Europe's largest bauxite deposits. However, before liberation, Hungary had few aluminum smelting factories, and bauxite was mainly exported as raw material. After liberation, Hungary's aluminum manufacturing industry experienced rapid development. In 1959, aluminum production had increased to 45,700 tons, equivalent to 45 times the 1938 level. Currently, the various aluminum products manufactured in Hungary not only meet the needs of the domestic people but can also be exported in large quantities. (Attached pictures)

    匈牙利的“白银”
    匈牙利拥有欧洲最大的铝土矿。但解放前，匈牙利没有多少炼铝的工厂，铝土矿都是作为原料出口的。解放后，匈牙利的制铝工业获得了迅速的发展。1959年铝的产量已增加到四万五千七百吨，相当于1938年的四十五倍。目前，匈牙利制造的各种铝制品，不仅能满足国内人民的需要，并且还能大量出口。（附图片）
