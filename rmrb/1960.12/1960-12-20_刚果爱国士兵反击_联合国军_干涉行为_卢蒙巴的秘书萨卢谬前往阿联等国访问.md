Xinhua News Agency, December 18th: Leopoldville dispatch: Congolese soldiers engaged in fierce fighting with the "UN forces," manipulated by American and other imperialists, in Leopoldville on the 16th.

The direct cause of this conflict was the "UN forces'" sheltering of Belgians disguised as Austrian medical personnel who had been arrested by Congolese soldiers, and their attempt to force the Congolese army to release them by force. The Congolese soldiers put up a tenacious resistance. It is reported that in the six-hour battle, one "UN forces" soldier was killed and three "UN forces" soldiers were injured, including a British officer. In addition, at least ten Congolese soldiers were killed by the "UN forces."

According to a Reuters report, since the Mobutu traitorous group, under the direction of U.S. imperialism, kidnapped Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba, Kasavubu has issued an arrest warrant for Kamitatu, the governor of Leopoldville province, because Kamitatu has consistently expressed his support for Congolese legitimate government Prime Minister Lumumba.

It is also reported that Salumu, one of the heads of the Stanleyville region in the Congo's Orientale Province and Prime Minister Lumumba's secretary, has left the Congo for visits to countries such as the UAR to seek support for the legitimate government of the Congo. Salumu said at a press conference in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, on the 16th, "As long as the Congo is free, Lumumba is the legitimate Prime Minister."

    刚果爱国士兵反击“联合国军”干涉行为
    卢蒙巴的秘书萨卢谬前往阿联等国访问
    新华社18日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果士兵16日在利奥波德维尔同受到美国等帝国主义操纵的“联合国军”发生了激烈的战斗。
    这次冲突的直接起因是由于“联合国军”庇护被刚果士兵逮捕的伪装成奥地利医务人员的比利时人，并且企图通过武力迫使刚果军队释放他们。刚果士兵进行了顽强的反击。据报道，在为时六小时的战斗中，一名“联合国军”士兵被击毙、三名“联合国军”士兵受伤，其中包括一个英国籍军官。另外，至少有十名刚果士兵被“联合国军”杀害。
    另据路透社的一则消息说，自蒙博托叛国集团在美帝国主义指使下绑架刚果总理卢蒙巴之后，卡萨武布已经发出逮捕利奥波德维尔省省长卡米塔图的拘票，因为卡米塔图一直表示支持刚果合法政府总理卢蒙巴。
    还有消息说，刚果东方省斯坦利维尔地区负责人之一、卢蒙巴总理的秘书萨卢谬已离开刚果前往阿联等国家进行访问，以争取对刚果合法政府的支持。萨卢谬16日在怯尼亚首都内罗毕举行的一次记者招待会上说，“只要刚果是自由的，卢蒙巴就是合法总理。”
