	Cherish Coal Like Gold, Compete for Every Ounce
	Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhou Yongkang

	Shanghai's Liming Printing and Dyeing Factory is an advanced unit in conserving coal. To dye one thousand meters of striped poplin, they used to use an average of 106 kilograms of coal last year, but this year they only need 7.5 kilograms.

	Since the Great Leap Forward, the output of various colored cloths in this factory has been continuously rising, and correspondingly, the demand for coal supply has also greatly increased. The workers of the Liming Factory have indeed put a lot of effort into saving coal. In the beginning, under the leadership of the Party branch, they launched a mass movement in which everyone participated to plug loopholes, and the entire factory was bustling with activity. This factory is an old factory. Over the years, the equipment has been modified and moved many times. Many water heating pipes used for dyeing cloth came out of the boiler room, and after seven turns and eight bends, they circled a large area before connecting to the machines in various production workshops. Some pipes were no longer used at all because the machines were moved, but the pipes were still scalding hot all day long. The workers called them "blind intestines." One day, a group of workers investigated the origin and destination of each pipe the night before and cut off more than 100 meters of redundant pipes at once. However, the remaining pipes were still exposed, and some of the heat was still being wasted. The workers used straw and lime instead of asbestos to give more than 400 meters of pipes "clothing." Some workers searched everywhere for air and heat leaks and plugged more than 100 leaks one after another. ... With this comprehensive plugging, the daily coal consumption immediately dropped by more than three tons.

	The obvious waste phenomena on the surface became less and less. Seeing the results of this first battle, the workers became more and more enthusiastic, and more and more methods emerged, and the conservation work became more in-depth. Some time ago, everyone felt that the most troublesome thing in winter was the "three colds": cold water, cold coal, and cold wind. The Party branch handed these three key issues over to the masses, and the workers all started using their brains again. Once everyone became attentive, many small things commonly seen in life attracted great attention, giving them a lot of inspiration. There was a worker in the boiler room named Shen Aiyang. One night, he was drinking in a restaurant and saw the waiter in the restaurant put a wine pot in hot water to warm the wine. He suddenly thought, why can't we use this method to heat the cold water in our boiler? The next day, he told the Party branch secretary about this idea. The Party branch secretary fully supported his suggestion. He and everyone connected a water pipe in the flue, using the residual heat in the flue to heat the cold water in the water pipe, and then send it to the boiler, saving a lot of coal for the boiler. Old stoker Shen Yulin also came up with a good way to overcome the difficulty of cold coal. He said to others: "I used to have a stomach problem, and I felt uncomfortable eating cold food. Eating hot rice porridge made my stomach feel very comfortable. I think we can also soak the coal in hot water first and then give it to the furnace to eat." This is really a good idea. Based on his suggestion, everyone used some waste hot water from the pipes to soak the coal in hot water. The furnace got "hot water soaked rice," and the coal consumption did not increase, but the furnace temperature increased a lot.

	While the stokers were tapping the potential of coal, the workers in each workshop who used water heaters also took active actions, doing everything possible to save water heaters and cooperate with the boiler room to fight together. In the pad dyeing workshop, there was a worker named Guo Fangmao. One day, others saw him staring blankly at the ventilation window of the jingyuan machine and asked him what he was doing. He said: "Now it is October, and the temperature of the water heater is very high, but the quality of the cloth is not good. I remember in August, the temperature of the water heater was lower than it is now, but the quality of the cloth was higher. I am wondering what is the reason for this? I think it is probably because the ventilation window is opened too wide." But some people next to him said that this practice is an old rule of the Liming Factory. If you don't do this, the dyed cloth will become brittle. This time, the Party branch decided to let Guo Fangmao do a bold experiment. Guo Fangmao appropriately lowered the temperature of the water heater and closed the ventilation window by half a foot. As a result, the jingyuan cloth was not only not brittle, but the passing rate of the quality key that had not been resolved for a long time—"reduction fastness"—increased from the original low level to 100%, saving coal and improving the quality of dyeing. The old method was originally for insurance purposes, so more coal was burned to increase the temperature of the water heater. However, if the temperature was too high, the cloth would become brittle if the window was not opened. Over time, this coal-consuming method became an old rule. After the pad dyeing workshop greatly saved on burning water heaters, Zhang Zhiyu, the production team leader and Communist Party member of the scouring workshop, thought that the scouring vat in his workshop was the place that used the most gas in the factory, and the potential for savings was even greater. One day, he was thinking about this problem even while eating. Unexpectedly, he accidentally burned his tongue with the soup. He looked and saw that there was a layer of oil on the soup, and it looked like the soup was not hot, but when he put it in his mouth, it scalded his tongue. This scald, however, gave him a clue. He put down his rice bowl and ran into the Party branch office and said: "Secretary of the branch, there is a layer of oil on the soup, and the temperature will not drop for a while. There is a thin film of caustic soda on the surface of the water in our scouring vat, maybe it can also keep it warm." The branch secretary thought this idea made sense and immediately asked him to experiment. At this time, striped poplin was being scoured in the scouring vat, and the specified temperature was seventy degrees. Zhang Zhiyu waited until the water heater burned to seventy degrees and then turned it off. Because there was a layer of caustic soda on the water, the heat did not dissipate, and the temperature did not drop for a long time. Later, after repeated experiments, some varieties that used to take a long time to scour were also reduced from the original eight hours to four hours, and finally only one hour was enough, and one catty of coal was worth several catties of coal.

	The series of good methods for saving coal created on furnaces and machines are very valuable; some methods have been fully promoted among counterparts in the city and have become a common wealth. But even more valuable is that among the workers in this factory, paying attention to saving one catty or two of coal has formed a new atmosphere. As someone said when summarizing their experience some time ago, they really cherish coal like gold and compete for every ounce! In this way, the workers reduced the average coal consumption in the first ten months of this year by 50% compared to last year, and provided a very favorable condition for increasing production.

    惜煤如金  斤两必争
    新华社记者　周永康
    上海丽明印染厂是个节约用煤的先进单位。同样染一千米条子府绸，去年平均要用一百零六公斤煤，今年只要用七公斤半。
    大跃进以来，这个厂各种色布产量不断上升，相形之下，煤炭的供应量也要求大大增加了。丽明厂的职工们为了节约用煤，的确花了不少心血。开始时，他们在党支部的领导下，掀起了一个人人动手、堵塞漏洞的群众运动，全厂闹得热火朝天。这个厂是个老厂，几年来，设备一改再改，一动再动，有许多染布用的水汀管子，从炉子间出来，七转八弯，绕了很大一个圈子，才通进各个生产车间，接在机器上；有些管子因为机器搬了地方，后来就根本不用了，可是管子还是一天到晚烫得灼人。工人们把它们叫做“盲肠”。一天，一批工人在头天夜里查明了各个管子的来龙去脉，一下子就割掉了一百多米多余的管子。可是留下的管子还是露在外面，一部分热量仍旧白白散掉。工人们又用稻草、石灰，代替石棉，给四百多米长的管子，换上了“衣裳”。还有些工人，到处寻找漏气、漏热的漏洞，先后堵住了一百多个漏洞。……这样四面一堵，每天的用煤马上下降了三吨多。
    表面上看得见的浪费现象越来越少了。工人们看到这第一个战役的战果，热情越来越高，办法越来越多，节约工作也就越来越深入。前些时候，大家感到冬天最伤脑筋的是“三冷”：冷水、冷煤、冷风。党支部把这三个关键交给了群众，工人们又都动起脑筋来了。大家一变成有心人，许多生活上常见的小事情，都被引起了很大的注意，使他们得到了许多启发。炉子间有个叫沈阿扬的工人，一天晚上在一家酒店里喝酒，看见店里服务员把酒壶放在热水里烫酒，他忽然想起，为什么不能用这个方法来烫我们炉子里的冷水呢？第二天，他把这个念头告诉了党支部书记。党支部书记完全支持他的建议。他就和大家在烟道里通进了一根水管，利用烟道里的余热，把水管的冷水烘热，然后再送进锅炉，烧锅炉的煤就省了许多。老司炉工沈玉麟也想了一个克服冷煤困难的好办法。他对别人说：“我过去有胃病，吃冷饭很不好受，一吃热泡饭，肚子里就很舒服。我看，我们也可以把煤先泡一泡热，再给炉子吃。”这真是一个好办法。大家根据他的提议，利用管道里的一些废热水，把煤泡热。炉子吃到了“热水泡饭”，用煤并不增加，炉温却提高了许多。
    司炉工在大挖煤炭的潜力，各车间用水汀的工人们，也积极行动起来，千方百计省用水汀，配合炉子间一起作战。轧染车间里有个工人叫郭芳懋。有一天，别人看见他老是呆呆地望着精元机上的通风窗，问他干什么，他说：“现在是10月，水汀温度很高，布的质量反而不好。记得8月里，水汀温度比现在低，布的质量反而比现在高，我在想，这是什么道理？我看恐怕是通风窗开得太大了。”可是旁边有人却说，这种做法是丽明厂的一套老规矩，不这样做，染出的布就发脆。这次，党支部决定叫郭芳懋作一次大胆的试验。郭芳懋把水汀温度适当地降低了一些，同时把通风窗关小了半尺，结果精元布不但不脆，过去长期未能解决的质量关键——“还原牢度”的及格率，反而从原来较低的水平提高到100％，省了煤，又提高了染布的质量。过去的那个办法原来是为了保险，就多烧煤，来提高水汀的温度。可是温度太高了，不把窗子打开，布又发脆。时间一长，这种费煤的办法就成了老规矩。轧染车间烧水汀大大节省以后，煮炼车间的生产小组长、共产党员张志裕，一想自己车间里的煮缸，是全厂用气最多的地方，节约潜力更大。有一天，他在吃饭的时候也在想这个问题。不料一不注意，被汤烫了舌头。他一看，原来汤上面有一层油，看上去好像汤并不热，谁知吃到嘴里，却烫麻了舌头。这一烫，却使他开了个窍门。他放下饭碗就跑进党支部办公室，说：“支部书记，汤上面有层油，温度一时不会下降。我们煮缸的水，表面有层烧碱的薄膜，说不定也能保温。”支部书记觉得这个想法很有道理，马上要他试验。这时，煮缸里正在煮条子府绸，规定温度是七十度，张志裕等水汀烧到七十度时就关掉，因为水上面有一层烧碱，热气未散，过了很久温度也没有下降。后来又经过一次又一次的试验，过去有些煮炼时间很长的品种，也从原来的八小时减为四小时，最后只煮一小时就够了，一斤煤就顶好几斤煤用。
    炉子上、机器上创造的一连串节约用煤的好方法，十分可贵；有些方法已在全市同行中全面推广，变成共同的财富。但更可贵的是在这个厂的工人们之中，注意节约一斤一两煤炭，已经形成一种新的风气。就像前些时候有人在总结他们的经验时所说的那样，真是惜煤如金，斤两必争！就这样，职工们使今年头十个月的平均用煤量，比去年降低了50％，并为增加生产提供了一个十分有利的条件。
