    Ode to Glorious Families
    Zheng Wen
    Members of the Shishan Commune in Echeng, Hubei, warmly praise Liang Xunwen, the deputy director of the commune, and his family, saying, "Heroes emerge in a heroic era, model families are all red, three generations of grandparents are all advanced, a new style of people's commune"; Liu Village Production Team of Wenfeng Commune in Cangshan, Shandong, has, under the influence of the exemplary actions of the Shao family's three brothers, consistently been at the forefront of all work in the entire commune, and is praised by the LinYi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party as a bright star of the Wenfeng Commune.

    After reading this news and communications, one is indeed moved. Judging from their deeds, the praise from the masses and the honors given to them by the Party and the government are well-deserved. Because they have made brilliant achievements for the cause of socialist construction in their respective positions. They not only labor consciously and voluntarily, but also lead the masses in creative labor. They regard the completion of the various tasks put forward by the Party in the countryside as the greatest joy. In Shishan Commune, there was an old ox that some people thought could not be kept alive and advocated killing it. However, Liang Xunwen's father, Liang Rubi, disagreed and volunteered to take the ox back and raise it himself. In hot weather, he fanned away mosquitoes and flies for the ox; in winter, he added refined feed to the ox to keep it from getting cold. After such careful feeding, the old ox grew fat and strong, with sleek fur. Not only is the old man Liang Rubi like this, but his son Liang Xunwen is a well-known rice high-yield model in the province, his wife Xiong Guiying is a pig-raising expert, his daughter-in-law Xiong Caihua is an excellent cook and labor model, and his granddaughter Liang Shaoying is a "four-good" student. The members of this glorious family are able to labor so well in their respective positions because they have a red heart that loves the commune and loves the collective. This "red heart," as Comrade Mao Zedong proclaimed in the article "In Memory of Norman Bethune," is the spirit of utter devotion to others without any thought of self, the true spirit of communism.

    After the people's commune system was implemented, due to the collectivization of production and life, everyone participated in labor, and therefore, a new change has taken place in the relationship between family members. This change is no longer the situation of individual economic families where wives were dependent on their husbands, mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law were at odds, and brothers quarreled over family property, but rather, they are closely linked together through common labor. On this basis, close, equal, and mutually helpful family and sibling relationships are established. The fact that every member of the Liang Xunwen model family is "red" and that the three Shao brothers are intimately connected is a reflection of this new type of family relationship and sibling relationship. However, they are not just working for the good of their own family or for good feelings between brothers, but even more for the sake of everyone. When Liang Xunwen's wife, Xiong Caihua, did not have a high enough level of political thought, she became an excellent cook and labor model who loved labor and loved the collective with the patient help of the whole family. This vividly illustrates that the family's concern and help are not only for Xiong Caihua's personal progress, but for the collective cause of the commune. The three Shao brothers are wholeheartedly for the collective and patiently help Liu Qinglin's wife, and the situation is the same. This is precisely the valuable thing that thousands upon thousands of families should learn from.

    In today's vigorous development of agriculture and grain production, more Liang Xunwen-style model families and Shao family three-brother-style close brothers are needed in the countryside to build a beautiful and happy rural people's commune.

    颂光荣人家
    郑闻
    湖北鄂城石山公社的社员们，热烈歌颂这个公社的副主任梁勋文一家为“英雄时代出英雄，模范人家个个红，祖孙三代都先进，人民公社新人风”；山东苍山文峰公社刘村生产队，由于在邵家三兄弟的模范行动的影响下，这个生产队的各项工作一直走在全公社的前面，被中共临沂地委誉为文峰公社的一颗明星。
    读了这条新闻和通讯以后，确实使人感动。从他们的事迹看来，群众对他们的赞扬，党和政府给他们的荣誉，他们是当之无愧的。因为他们在各自的工作岗位上，为社会主义建设事业做出了光辉的成就。他们不仅是自觉自愿地劳动，而且带动群众一起进行创造性的劳动。他们把完成党在农村中所提出的各项任务，当做是最大的快乐。在石山公社里，有一头老黄牛，有人认为养不活了，主张把它杀掉。可是梁勋文的父亲梁如毕却不同意，便自告奋勇地把牛牵回来自己养。热天，给牛搧蚊子，打苍蝇；冬天，给牛加精料，不让它受冷。经过这样的精心喂养，老黄牛长得膘肥肉壮，油光水滑。不光是梁如毕老汉如此，儿子梁勋文是全省有名的水稻丰产模范，老伴熊桂英是养猪的能手，媳妇熊才华是优秀的炊事员和劳动模范，孙女梁少英是“四好”学生。这个光荣人家的成员，所以能够在各自的岗位上出色地劳动，就是因为有一颗热爱公社、热爱集体的红心。这个“红心”正如毛泽东同志在《纪念白求恩》一文中所宣扬的是毫不利己专门利人的精神，是真正的共产主义的精神。
    人民公社化以后，由于生产和生活的集体化，人人参加了劳动，因之，在家庭成员之间的关系上，也就起着一个新的变化。这个变化不再是个体经济家庭时那种妻子依附丈夫，婆媳不和，兄弟为家产争吵的局面，而是通过共同的劳动，把他们紧紧地联系在一起。在这个基础上建立起亲密的平等的互相帮助的家庭关系和兄弟关系。梁勋文模范人家个个红，邵家三兄弟亲密无间，就是这种新型的家庭关系、兄弟关系的体现。但是，他们并不是光为自己的家庭好，兄弟之间感情好，而更多地是为了大家。当梁勋文的爱人熊才华政治思想不够开展的时候，在全家人的耐心帮助下，成为热爱劳动热爱集体的优秀炊事员和劳动模范，这就生动地说明了家人的关心和帮助，不仅是为了熊才华个人的进步，而是为了公社的集体事业。邵家三兄弟一心一意为集体，耐心帮助刘庆林的爱人，也是如此。这正是值得千千万万的家庭学习的可贵地方。
    在大办农业、大办粮食的今天，在农村中需要更多的梁勋文式的模范人家和邵家三兄弟式的亲密兄弟，来建设美好幸福的农村人民公社。
