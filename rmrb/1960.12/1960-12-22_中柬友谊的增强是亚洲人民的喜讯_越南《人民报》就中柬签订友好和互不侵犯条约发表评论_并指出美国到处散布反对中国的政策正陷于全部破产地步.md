Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 21st: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary today stating that "The recent joint statement issued by China and Cambodia and the signing of the Sino-Cambodian Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression mark a new stage in the relations between the two countries. At the same time, this is also good news for the Asian people in strengthening solidarity and fighting against US imperialism, defending peace, and national independence."

The commentary pointed out that the friendly documents signed by China and Cambodia this time are a new victory for the peaceful and friendly foreign policy of the Government of the People's Republic of China. This is a shameful failure for the imperialist bloc, which has consistently tried every possible means to provoke relations between China and various nationalist countries, especially China's neighboring countries. The signing of this treaty proves that the US imperialist policy of spreading opposition to China everywhere is heading towards complete bankruptcy.

The commentary, in discussing Prince Sihanouk's visit to China and his earlier visits to Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia, said that this is a good result of Cambodia's consistent adherence to a policy of peace and neutrality. The commentary said that the development and consolidation of friendly relations between Cambodia and China are fully in line with the interests of the people of both countries. The commentary said that the development of Sino-Cambodian relations once again proves the argument in the statement of the Moscow Meeting of Eighty-One Communist and Workers' Parties: "Socialist countries are the sincere and loyal friends of the people who are striving for liberation or have already escaped from imperialist enslavement and oppression."

The commentary said that the situation in Indochina is becoming increasingly serious. US imperialism and its servants, especially the Thai authorities and the Ngo Dinh Diem group, are blatantly interfering in and invading Laos, and are also plotting to interfere in Cambodia. These circumstances make the Sino-Cambodian Treaty of Friendship of great significance for Cambodia's national construction and consolidation of independence, and at the same time, contribute to the maintenance of peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

The commentary concluded by saying that as brothers and neighbors of the Chinese and Cambodian people, the Vietnamese people are pleased with the strengthening of friendly relations between China and Cambodia, and regard it as a positive contribution to strengthening the Asian people's struggle to maintain peace and national independence and oppose the common enemy—US imperialism and its servants.

    中柬友谊的增强是亚洲人民的喜讯
    越南《人民报》就中柬签订友好和互不侵犯条约发表评论
    并指出美国到处散布反对中国的政策正陷于全部破产地步
    新华社河内21日电　越南《人民报》今天发表评论说，“中国同柬埔寨最近所发表的联合声明和中柬友好和互不侵犯条约的签订，标志着两国关系已经进入了一个新的阶段，同时这对加强团结和为反对美帝国主义、保卫和平和民族独立而斗争的亚洲人民也是一个喜讯。”
    评论指出，中国同柬埔寨这次所签订的友好文件，是中华人民共和国政府的和平和友好的外交政策的新胜利。这是一贯用千方百计力图挑拨中国同各个民族主义国家，尤其中国的邻近国家的关系的帝国主义集团可耻的失败。这个条约的签订证明了美帝国主义到处散布反对中国的政策，正在陷于遭到全部破产的地步。
    评论在谈到西哈努克亲王这次访问中国和不久前访问捷克斯洛伐克、苏联、蒙古时说，这是柬埔寨坚持奉行的和平中立政策的美好结果。评论说，柬中友好关系的发展和巩固，完全符合两国人民的利益。评论说，中柬关系的发展，再一次证明了八十一个共产党和工人党莫斯科会议的声明中的论点：“社会主义国家是正在争取解放或者已经挣脱了帝国主义奴役和压迫的人民的真诚的和忠实的朋友。”
    评论说，目前，印度支那局势日益严重。美帝国主义及其仆从，特别是泰国当局和吴庭艳集团正在悍然干涉和侵略老挝，同时也正在阴谋干涉柬埔寨。这些情况使得中柬友好条约对柬埔寨建设国家和巩固独立具有重大意义，同时，为维护印度支那和东南亚的和平作出了贡献。
    评论最后说，作为中国人民和柬埔寨人民兄弟和邻居，越南人民为中国和柬埔寨之间加强友好关系感到高兴，并把它看做是对加强亚洲人民维护和平和民族独立，反对共同敌人——美帝国主义及其仆从的斗争力量作出的积极贡献。
