Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 20th: While continuously increasing steel production through the "Hundred Furnace No Scrap Steel" competition, the workers of Kunming No. 2 Steel Plant have launched a new "Hundred Furnace First-Grade Products" competition. They are seizing the final opportunity of this year to strive to produce more high-quality steel for the country.

Since late August this year, the steelmaking workshop of Kunming No. 2 Steel Plant has continuously improved steel production and quality through the "Hundred Furnace No Scrap Steel" competition. The Zhang Peixuan group, which pioneered the "Hundred Furnace No Scrap Steel" achievement, has reached over 700 furnaces without scrap steel in this competition. The Li Biao group, which previously had relatively poor steel quality, achieved over 800 furnaces without scrap steel, and the Chu Liang group even set a record of 1,000 consecutive furnaces without scrap steel. The output of first-grade steel in the entire workshop increased by more than 20% in September compared to August, by more than 15% in October compared to September, and by more than 5% in November compared to October, reaching about 75%. At the same time, new records such as "Hundred Furnace No Leaking Steel" and "Hundred Furnace No Running Steel" have also emerged continuously.

The workshop's Party organization analyzed the current production situation in late November. Based on the state's requirements for next year, they were determined to produce more first-grade steel and more varieties of high-quality steel. To this end, the Party organization formulated a plan to launch the "Hundred Furnace First-Grade Products" competition, mobilizing everyone to take immediate action and seize the final opportunity of this year to further improve the quality of steel. Leading cadres at all levels in the workshop also went deep into the groups to understand the workers' reactions to the "Hundred Furnace First-Grade Steel" competition and organized steelworkers to listen to the opinions of rolling mill workers on improving the quality of steel ingots. The workshop also held small quality exhibitions, introducing which steel should be rolled into which materials, which steel cannot be rolled into materials, and which steel can be rolled into high-grade steel. Through this series of ideological work, organizational work, and material education, the state's requirements for further improving steel quality were transformed into the urgent desire of the majority of workers. Subsequently, the workshop convened a meeting of worker representatives, made a resolution to launch the "Hundred Furnace First-Grade Products" competition, and unfolded a heated challenge and response. A high-quality, high-yield competition with "Hundred Furnace First-Grade Steel" as the main content was launched vigorously throughout the workshop.

In order to lead the smooth development of this movement, leading cadres at all levels have gone deep into various groups to summarize production management methods and technical operation experience. A system of three-shift meetings and daily exchange of experiences has been established. The workshop also ran short-term technical training classes, where leading cadres and technicians lectured on the key points of smelting high-quality steel, the basic technical knowledge of the proportioning ratio, etc., and conducted on-site examinations and regular tests for the workers. The entire workshop also organized close cooperation between shifts and groups.

The workers have actively invested in the "Hundred Furnace First-Grade Products" competition. The workers of the Zhang Peixuan group, known as "Quality Pioneers," held three group meetings to study the main keys and sent people to fraternal groups to learn in order to first win the victory of "Hundred Furnace First-Grade Products." They have already created a record of 86 consecutive furnaces of first-grade products. In early December, their first-grade product rate had reached 94%, steel production had completed half of the monthly plan, and the iron consumption per ton of steel was 1.068 tons. Other work sections and groups have also continuously achieved new accomplishments in furnace building, casting, and iron melting in the competition to cooperate with converters to seize more first-grade steel. The Zhang Jinrong furnace building group has already achieved 855 furnaces without leaking steel.

    在不断提高钢产量的同时进一步提高质量
    昆明第二钢铁厂开展“百炉一级品”竞赛
    据新华社昆明20日电　昆明第二钢铁厂职工在“百炉无废钢”竞赛不断取得胜利的基础上，又掀起了一个“百炉一级品”的竞赛热潮，抓紧今年最后时机，力争为国家增产更多的好钢。
    自今年8月下旬以来，昆明第二钢铁厂炼钢车间通过“百炉无废钢”竞赛，不断地提高了钢的产量、质量。首创“百炉无废钢”成绩的张培轩小组，在这一竞赛中，达到七百多炉无废钢。一向钢的质量较差的李标小组达到八百多炉无废钢，储良小组更创造了连续千炉无废钢的最高纪录。全车间的一级钢产量，9月比8月上升20％以上，10月比9月上升15％以上，11月比10月又上升5％以上，达到了75％左右。同时，“百炉不漏钢”、“百炉不跑钢”等新纪录也不断出现。
    车间党组织在11月下旬分析了当前的生产状况。根据明年国家的要求，他们决心要生产更多的一级钢和多品种优质钢。为此，党组织拟订了开展“百炉一级品”竞赛的计划，动员大家立即行动，抓紧今年最后时机把钢的质量再提高一步。车间各级领导干部也都深入到小组里去，了解职工群众对开展“百炉一级钢”竞赛的反映，组织炼钢工人听取轧钢工人关于提高钢锭质量的意见。车间里还举办小型质量展览会，介绍什么钢轧制什么材，什么钢不能轧材，什么钢可轧高级钢材。通过这一系列的思想工作，组织工作和实物教育，就把国家关于进一步提高钢的质量的要求，变成了广大职工的迫切愿望。接着，车间召开职工代表会议，做出了开展“百炉一级品”竞赛决议，展开了热烈的挑战应战，以“百炉一级钢”为主要内容的优质高产竞赛，就在全车间轰轰烈烈地开展了起来。
    为了领导这一运动的顺利开展，各级领导干部纷纷深入各小组，总结生产管理方法和技术操作经验。建立了三班碰头、日日交流经验的制度。车间还开办了短期技术学习班，由领导干部、技术人员讲授炼优质钢的吹炼操作要点，配料比例等基本技术知识，并对职工们进行了现场考试和定期测验。全车间还组织了班与班、组与组的紧密配合和协作。
    职工们都积极地投入了“百炉一级品”竞赛。被誉为“优质先锋”的张培轩小组工人为了首先夺得“百炉一级品”的胜利，召开了三次小组会研究主要关键，并且派人到兄弟组去学习。他们已创造了连续八十六炉一级品的最高纪录。12月上旬，他们的一级品率已达到94％，钢的产量已完成全月计划的一半，炼一吨钢的铁耗量为一点零六八吨。其它各工段、小组在协同转炉夺取更多的一级钢的竞赛中，也在筑炉、浇铸、化铁等方面，不断地取得了新成就。张金荣筑炉小组已做到了八百五十五炉不漏钢。
