    Organize Commune Members to Widely Accumulate Refined Fertilizer
    Democratic Production Team Implements Relevant Policies to Carry Out Fertilizer Accumulation Campaign
    Sufficient Fertilization of Overwintering Crops and Preparation of Base Fertilizer for Early and Mid-Season Rice
    (Reported by our newspaper) The Democratic Production Team of Guankou People's Commune in Xishui County, Hubei Province, adheres to the principle of combining political command with material guarantees and implements the policy of reasonable remuneration and more pay for more work, mobilizing commune members to vigorously produce fertilizer, resulting in a situation where every household accumulates fertilizer every day. The team's overwintering crop area this year is more than double that of last year, and all of it has been fertilized with base fertilizer. Currently, the field management of overwintering crops, with topdressing as the main content, is also progressing rapidly. More than 240 mu of rapeseed has been topdressed twice, and most of the 2,050 mu of wheat and barley have been topdressed with liquid manure once. They are currently rushing to apply winter fertilizer to keep them warm, help them survive the winter, and promote tillering. Not only is there sufficient topdressing for overwintering crops, but also a batch of base fertilizer has been prepared for early and mid-season rice next year.
  Frequently Educate Commune Members on the Connection Between More Fertilizer and More Grain
    The Party branch of this team has realized from years of practice that fertilizer is the key to the continuous leap forward in agricultural production. The Party branch often uses accounting and comparison methods to educate commune members on the connection between more fertilizer and more grain, and between good fertilizer and more grain. The whole team selects and rewards advanced units and individuals in fertilizer accumulation every quarter, and the small teams select them every month. In addition to encouraging commune members to accumulate more fertilizer, the Party branch also frequently educates commune members to pay attention to fertilizer quality, pay attention to fertilizer preservation, and criticizes the phenomenon of only pursuing quantity and disregarding quality. The Third Small Team once made compost that did not meet the standards, and some of the fertilizer was lost. After being reminded by the production team, they immediately processed and added materials to improve the fertilizer quality.
  Adhere to the Three Guarantees and One Reward System, Fix Cultivated Land to Small Teams, and Encourage Small Teams to Continuously Cultivate Soil Fertility
    The Democratic Team has always adhered to the policy of "three guarantees" (guaranteed output, guaranteed cost, guaranteed workdays) reward and compensation fulfillment and fixing cultivated land for small teams to cultivate. Therefore, the small teams and the vast number of commune members are actively processing and fertilizing the land, striving to overproduce and receive rewards; and they are required to accumulate as much farm fertilizer as possible and buy less commercial fertilizer in order to save production investment and increase the income of commune members. According to the opinions of the commune members, the Party branch resolutely adopted the principle of focusing on farm fertilizer and supplementing it with commercial fertilizer, and mobilized commune members to vigorously produce fertilizer. In 1959, the team spent more than 12,300 yuan on purchasing commercial fertilizer, but in 1960, it only spent 5,800 yuan, which greatly saved investment and greatly increased fertilizer.
    Reasonable Remuneration for Fertilizer Accumulation, More Accumulation, More Gain
    In order to encourage commune members to actively produce farm fertilizer, this team conscientiously implemented the policy of reasonable remuneration and more pay for more work in fertilizer work. The Democratic Team has a permanent fertilizer accumulation team, and each small team has fixed a group of people to specialize in fertilizer accumulation year-round, with the main task of burning fire manure and storing manure in cellars all year round. The team's more than 90 feeders (most of whom are part-time cattle feeders), 18 cooks, and toilet managers are all part-time permanent fertilizer accumulators. In fertilizer accumulation, these personnel are assigned fixed tasks, stipulated fertilizer quality standards, and work points are recorded by the piece, with rewards for exceeding the quota. The fertilizer accumulation tasks of these personnel are determined by the Party branch, based on their different fertilizer accumulation conditions, in the spirit of being proactive, reliable, and leaving room for improvement, after discussion by the commune members. For example, the team has 241 cattle, one manure storage for each cow. The task of accumulating fertilizer is assigned to each cattle-raising commune member according to the different conditions of large and small cattle, and yellow cattle and buffalo. The fertilizer accumulation task of pig feeders is determined according to the different conditions of more or fewer pigs, and large and small pigs. According to the number of people eating in the canteen and the different stoves and fuels, the cooks are assigned the task of accumulating ash fertilizer and sewage. After they complete the specified fertilizer accumulation task, work points are recorded by the piece. In addition to the work points being recorded as usual, they are also awarded 10% to 20% of the work points they should have earned for the excess part, depending on the amount of the excess and the quality of the fertilizer.
      Digging Pond Mud, "Ponds Follow the Fields"
    Digging pond mud is an important way to accumulate fertilizer in winter. The Democratic Team stipulates that pond mud should be taken by each small team, basically according to the principle of "ponds follow the fields." For the few large ponds that are used in common, the relevant small teams should consult together, and work together to drain water and dig pond mud according to the principle of equal value and mutual benefit. The specific method is generally: according to the ratio of the area of ​​the pond irrigated, each small team sends a certain number of laborers to participate in draining the pond, and the pond mud is distributed in the same proportion. The pond mud is divided into blocks, and each small team picks up their own part. Those who work more can get more pond mud. Each small team reasonably formulates labor quotas for draining water and picking pond mud based on conditions such as steepness, level water, and transportation distance, and work points are awarded to commune members based on the completion of the quotas, with more work getting more pay.
    Encourage Commune Members to Accumulate More Fertilizer and Deliver More Fertilizer
    In addition to first focusing on collective fertilizer accumulation, the Democratic Team also actively focuses on individual fertilizer accumulation. In order to encourage commune members to accumulate fertilizer in their households, in addition to commending commune members who attach importance to household fertilizer accumulation and actively sell fertilizer to the team, the following measures have been taken: 1. In order to solve the contradiction between commune members selling fertilizer to the team and using fertilizer for their private plots, the small teams and commune members negotiate and stipulate the task of selling fertilizer to the team according to the number of people in each household. The surplus can be kept for their own use or sold, and those who sell more than the quota will be rewarded. 2. High-quality fertilizers such as human manure and urine, chicken and duck manure, and pigpen manure accumulated in private toilets and manure storages of commune members will be purchased with cash; other fertilizers with poor quality such as old brick soil and fire manure will be recorded with work points. 3. Differentiated pricing, with high quality fetching high prices. The implementation of these measures has further improved the enthusiasm of commune members to accumulate fertilizer in their households and sell fertilizer to the team.
    Farm fertilizer generally has a large volume, large quantity, and complex variety, making it difficult to count and test quality. In order to effectively implement the policy of reasonable remuneration and more pay for more work, and to encourage commune members to accumulate more fertilizer and accumulate good fertilizer, the Democratic Team attaches great importance to fertilizer acceptance work. Each small team has a deputy team leader who is specifically in charge of fertilizer work, whom the commune members call the "Fertilizer Team Leader." The fertilizer acceptance personnel democratically elected by the commune members carry out fertilizer acceptance work under the leadership of the "Fertilizer Team Leader."

    组织社员广积精肥
    民主生产队贯彻有关政策开展积肥运动
    越冬作物施肥充足，并为早中稻备下底肥
    本报讯　湖北省浠水县关口人民公社民主生产队，坚持政治挂帅和物质保证相结合的原则，贯彻执行合理报酬、多劳多得的政策，发动社员大办肥料，出现了户户积肥、天天积肥的局面。全队今年越冬作物面积比去年扩大两倍多，全部施了底肥。当前以追肥为主要内容的越冬作物田间管理工作也进展很快，二百四十多亩油菜已经普遍追肥两次，两千零五十多亩大、小麦，大部分追了一次水粪，目前正在赶施保暖过冬、促进分蘖的腊肥。这里不仅越冬作物追肥充足，而且还为明年早、中稻准备了一批底肥。
  对社员经常进行肥多粮多教育
    这个队的党支部从历年来的实践中认识到：肥料是农业生产持续跃进的关键。党支部经常用算账、对比的方法，对社员进行肥多粮多、肥好粮多的教育。全队每个季度评选、奖励一次积肥先进单位和个人，小队每月评选一次。除了鼓励社员多积肥外，党支部还经常教育社员重视肥料质量，注意保存肥料，对只图数量、不顾质量的现象进行批评。三小队有一次做的堆肥不合规格，流失了部分肥料，经生产队提醒后，他们立即加工加料，提高了肥料质量。
  坚持三包一奖制，耕地固定小
    队，鼓励小队不断培养地力
    民主队几年来始终坚持“三包”奖赔兑现和将耕地固定给小队耕作的政策。因而，小队和广大社员都积极对土地加工加肥，争取超产得奖；并且要求尽量多积农家肥料，少买商品肥料，以节省生产投资，增加社员收入。党支部根据社员的意见，坚决采取了以农家肥料为主、以商品肥料为辅的方针，发动社员大办肥料。1959年全队用于购买商品肥料的钱是一万二千三百多元，1960年只五千八百元，大大节省了投资，而且肥料大大增加。
    积肥报酬合理，多积多得
    为了鼓励社员人人动手大办农家肥料，这个队在肥料工作中认真贯彻实行了合理报酬、多劳多得的政策。民主队有一支常年积肥队伍，各小队都固定了一批人常年专门积肥，主要任务是一年四季烧火粪、窖粪垱。全队九十多个饲养员（其中大部分是兼职的养牛员）、十八个炊事员，和厕所管理员等都是兼职的常年积肥人员。在积肥中，对这些人员实行固定任务，规定肥料质量标准，按件记工分，超额奖励。这些人员的积肥任务是根据他们不同的积肥条件，本着积极可靠、留有余地的精神，经过社员讨论确定的。比如，全队有二百四十一头牛，一条牛一个粪垱，根据大牛小牛、黄牛水牛的不同情况，给每个养牛社员定出积肥任务。养猪员的积肥任务则是根据猪多猪少、猪大猪小的不同情况规定的。根据食堂入伙人数多少和炉灶、燃料的不同，给炊事人员规定了积灰肥和污水的任务。他们完成规定的积肥任务，按件记工分，超过任务的部分，除工分按件照记外，另外根据超额多少和肥料质量好坏，分别奖给超过部分应得工分的10％到20％。
      挖塘泥，“塘随田走”
    挖塘泥是冬季一项重要的积肥门路。民主队规定：基本上按照“塘随田走”的原则，各小队分别取用塘泥。少数共同使用的大塘，各有关的小队共同协商，按照等价互利的原则，协力车水挖塘泥。具体办法一般是：按照每口塘灌溉田亩的比例，各小队分别出一定数量的劳动力参加车水干塘，按同样的比例分配塘泥，塘泥划块，各小队挑各小队的；多出工的可以多得塘泥。各小队根据陡水平水、运输远近等条件合理制订车水、挑塘泥的劳动定额，按完成定额的情况给社员评工记分，多劳多得。
    鼓励社员多积肥、多交肥
    民主队除了首先抓集体积肥外，也积极地抓个人积肥。为了鼓励社员家庭积肥，他们除了对重视家庭积肥并积极向队里交售肥料的社员进行表扬外，并采取了下面几个办法：一、为了解决社员向队里交售肥料和自留地用肥的矛盾，小队和社员协商，按照各户人口的多少，分别规定向队里交售肥料的任务，多余的可以留作自用，也可以交售，超额交售的给予奖励。二、社员私人厕所、粪垱所积的人粪尿、鸡鸭粪、猪栏粪等优质肥料，现金收购；其他陈砖土、火粪等质量较差的肥料记工分。三、分等作价，优质优价。实行这些办法，进一步提高了社员家庭积肥和向队里交售肥料的积极性。
    农家肥料一般体积大、数量多、品种繁杂，不容易计数和检验质量。民主队为了切实实行合理报酬、多劳多得的政策，鼓励社员多积肥，积好肥，十分重视肥料的验收工作。每个小队都有一个专管肥料工作的副小队长，社员们称他是“肥料队长”。社员们民主选出的肥料验收人员，在“肥料队长”的领导下，进行肥料验收工作。
