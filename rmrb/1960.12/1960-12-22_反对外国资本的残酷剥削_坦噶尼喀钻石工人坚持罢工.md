    Opposing the Cruel Exploitation of Foreign Capital
    Tanzanian Diamond Workers Persist in Strike
    Diamond mine workers in the Mwadui area of Tanganyika recently launched a strike demanding higher wages and improved working conditions. The strike is currently ongoing.

    Following the workers' strike, the capitalist side threatened that if they did not return to work, all striking workers would be fired. The miners ignored the capitalist's threats and persisted in their strike, forcing the capitalist side to withdraw this threat.

    The miners expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the statement issued by the Tanganyikan government on the 16th opposing the strike and stating that if workers demanded higher wages, foreign investors would be afraid to invest in Tanganyika.

    Mwadui is one of Tanganyika's main diamond mining areas, but the entire country's diamond industry is monopolized by foreign companies.

    反对外国资本的残酷剥削
    坦噶尼喀钻石工人坚持罢工
    坦噶尼喀姆瓦杜伊地方的钻石矿工人最近举行罢工，要求提高工资和改善劳动条件。目前罢工还在继续进行中。
    在工人罢工后，资方曾进行威胁说，如果他们不复工，将把所有罢工的工人解雇。矿工们不理睬资方的威胁，坚持进行罢工，迫使资方不得不撤回这种威胁。
    矿工们对坦噶尼喀政府16日发表的反对罢工，并说什么如果工人们要求提高工资、外国投资者就不敢在坦噶尼喀投资的声明，表示极大的不满。
    姆瓦杜伊是坦噶尼喀主要钻石矿区之一，但是，整个这个国家的钻石工业都被外国公司所垄断。
