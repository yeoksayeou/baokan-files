The representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries, at this conference, discussed the urgent issues of the current international situation and the struggle for peace, national independence, democracy, and socialism.

The conference demonstrated that the participants had a unified view on the issues discussed. The Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries unanimously affirmed their loyalty to the Declaration and the Peace Declaration adopted in 1957. These two creative Marxist-Leninist programmatic documents determined the principled stance of the international communist movement on the most important issues of the contemporary world, significantly promoting the unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries in their struggle for common goals. These documents remain the fighting banner and guide to action for the entire international communist movement.

The events of the past three years have confirmed the correctness of the analysis of the international situation and the prospects for world development presented in these two documents, confirming the great scientific power and active role of creative Marxism-Leninism.

The main summary of these years is: the rapid growth of the power and international influence of the world socialist system; the rapid disintegration of the colonial system under the blows of the national liberation movement; the intensification of class struggle in the capitalist world; the increasing decay and rot of the capitalist world system. On the world stage, the forces of socialism are increasingly surpassing imperialism, and the forces of peace are increasingly surpassing the forces of war.

However, imperialism is trying to maintain its positions, obstructing disarmament, and striving to prolong and intensify the "Cold War," stubbornly preparing for a new world war. Therefore, real life urgently demands that the socialist countries, the international working class, the anti-imperialist national movements, all peace-loving countries, and all peace fighters increasingly unite their forces and take decisive actions to prevent war and ensure the peaceful life of people. Real life urgently demands that all revolutionary forces further unite and struggle against imperialism, for national independence and socialism.

I

The era, which began with the great October Socialist Revolution and is primarily characterized by the transition from capitalism to socialism, is an era of struggle between two opposing social systems, an era of socialist and national liberation revolutions, an era of the collapse of imperialism and the destruction of the colonial system, an era in which more and more people are taking the path of socialism, and socialism and communism are triumphing worldwide.

The main features of our era are that the world socialist system is becoming the decisive factor in the development of human society.

The great struggle between the old and new worlds over the past few decades has proven that socialism is powerful and invincible. The attempts of imperialism and its vanguard—fascism—to obstruct the course of historical development through war have failed. Imperialism no longer has the power to block the path of socialist revolution in Europe and Asia. Socialism has become a world system. The plots of imperialism to stop the economic development of socialist countries have been foiled. Imperialism has used every means to maintain the system of colonial slavery, but this system is collapsing. With the consolidation of the world socialist system, the international situation is increasingly changing in favor of the peoples striving for independence, democracy, and social progress.

In the present era, the main content, main direction, and main features of the historical development of human society are determined by the world socialist system, by the forces striving for socialist transformation of society against imperialism. No struggles of imperialism can stop the historical development. The solid foundation for the further decisive victory of socialism has been laid. The complete victory of socialism is inevitable.

The process of social development confirms Lenin's foresight: socialist countries, through economic construction, have a major impact on the development of the world revolution. Socialism has achieved unprecedented creative achievements in production, science, and technology, in building a new, free, and increasingly able to ensure the material and spiritual needs of people, a fraternal community. Socialism is also close to occupying the leading position in the world production. Capitalism will suffer defeat in the decisive sphere of human activity, that is, in the sphere of material production.

The consolidation and development of the socialist system have an increasing impact on the struggle of the peoples of capitalist countries. The world socialist system, with its exemplary power, revolutionizes the minds of laborers in the capitalist world, inspires them to struggle against capitalism, and to a large extent improves the conditions of this struggle. In the capitalist countries, the internal forces for the defense of peace and national independence, for the victory of democracy and socialism, are growing and strengthening.

The world capitalist system is in a process of deep decay and disintegration. The contradictions of imperialism are accelerating the transformation of monopoly capitalism into state monopoly capitalism. State monopoly capitalism strengthens the rule of monopoly organizations over national life, combining the power of monopoly organizations with the power of the state, in order to save the capitalist system, to maximize the profits of the imperialist bourgeoisie through the exploitation of the working class and the plunder of broad strata of the population.

However, the monopoly bourgeoisie has no means to save capitalism. The interests of a small group of monopoly organizations are in irreconcilable conflict with the interests of the whole nation. Class antagonism and national antagonism, internal contradictions and external contradictions in capitalist society are becoming increasingly acute. The attempts to support the rotten foundations of capitalism with militarism are making these contradictions even more tense.

In the capitalist world, the conflict between productive forces and production relations has never been so deep. Capitalism is increasingly hindering the use of modern scientific and technological achievements for the benefit of social progress. Capitalism uses the genius of humanity against humanity itself, turning these discoveries into cruel means of destructive war.

The instability of capitalist economics is increasing. Despite some growth in production in certain capitalist countries, the contradictions of capitalism, both domestically and internationally, are constantly sharpening. A series of capitalist countries have not yet overcome the full consequences of the recent economic crisis, and now face the threat of new economic shocks. The anarchic nature of capitalist production is deepening. The process of capitalist concentration is unprecedentedly accelerating, and the profits and super-profits of monopoly organizations are increasing. Monopoly capital, through various new forms, primarily through the intensification of labor, is unparalleled in its exploitation of the working class. Under capitalist conditions, the automation and "rationalization" of production bring new disasters to the laborers. In some countries, the working class can only satisfy some of its immediate demands through stubborn struggle; in many capitalist countries, the standard of living remains below the pre-war level. Contrary to the promises of the bourgeoisie, only in a few capitalist countries, and only temporarily, has full employment been achieved. The tyranny of monopoly organizations is increasingly harming the interests of the broad masses of farmers and the broad strata of the petty bourgeoisie. In capitalist countries, including some of the most developed capitalist countries, economically underdeveloped regions with particularly impoverished living conditions for the masses still exist, and such regions are even expanding.

All this once again refutes the lies of bourgeois ideologists and revisionists that modern capitalism has supposedly become "people's capitalism," that it has supposedly established a so-called "welfare state" that can overcome the anarchy of production and economic crises and ensure the well-being of all laborers.

The uneven development of capitalism is constantly changing the balance of power between imperialist countries. The smaller the sphere of imperialist rule, the more acute the contradictions between imperialist powers become. The market problem has become unprecedentedly acute. Under the banner of "integration," new international organizations are emerging, which in reality are deepening the contradictions and struggles between imperialist countries. These organizations are new forms of the division of the capitalist world market by the largest capitalist groups, new forms of economic penetration by stronger imperialist countries into their weaker partners.

In the main imperialist country of the modern era—America, the decay of capitalism is most evident. American monopoly capital has clearly shown its inability to utilize the existing productive forces. The richest of the developed capitalist countries—America—has become a country with particularly severe chronic unemployment. Insufficient industrial capacity has become a common phenomenon there. In the post-war years, despite the significant increase in military spending at the expense of lowering the living standards of the working people, the rate of production growth is declining, barely exceeding the rate of population growth. The crises of overproduction are becoming more frequent. This most industrialized capitalist country has become the most deformed country of militarized economy. America is more than any other capitalist country plundering the wealth of Asian countries, especially Latin American countries, hindering their development. American capital is rapidly penetrating Africa. American imperialism has become the greatest international exploiter.

American imperialism uses military alliances and economic "aid" as its main means to try to subjugate many countries to its rule. It also undermines the sovereignty of developed capitalist countries. The ruling monopoly bourgeoisie in the most developed capitalist countries, forming an alliance with American imperialism, sacrifices the sovereignty of their own countries, hoping to rely on the support of American imperialists to suppress revolutionary liberation forces, deprive the working people of democratic freedoms, and hinder the struggle of the masses for social progress. American imperialism is dragging these countries into an arms race, making them execute policies of preparing for new aggressive wars and subversive activities against socialist countries and neutral countries.

The foundations of the capitalist system have rotted to such an extent that in many countries, the imperialist bourgeoisie in power can no longer single-handedly cope with the growing and united democratic and progressive forces. Imperialists form various military-political alliances led by America to jointly fight against the socialist camp, strangle the national liberation movement, the workers' movement, and the socialist movement. The course of international events in recent years has provided many new proofs that American imperialism is the main stronghold of world reaction, the international gendarme, and the enemy of all peoples of the world.

The military alliance system established by America is being weakened by the struggles between the members of these alliances and the struggles of the masses to abolish these alliances. American imperialists are striving to strengthen the aggressive alliances, which is causing greater resistance from the masses. Despite the decline in America's share in the capitalist world economy, it remains the main economic, financial, and military force of modern imperialism. British and French imperialists are fiercely fighting to maintain their positions. The monopoly organizations of West Germany and Japan, which have restored their strength and are closely linked with American monopoly organizations, are rapidly expanding outward. West German monopoly organizations are implementing imperialist policies, becoming increasingly active in exploiting underdeveloped countries.

The peoples of various countries are increasingly resolutely rising up to fight against imperialism. The forces of labor and capital, the forces of democracy and reaction, the forces of freedom and colonialism are engaged in a large-scale confrontation. The profound victory of the people's revolution in Cuba has become a good example for the peoples of Latin American countries. In Africa, the anti-colonial movement for freedom and national independence is sweeping forward with irresistible force. The anti-imperialist national uprising in Iraq has succeeded. In Japan, a powerful mass movement for peace, democracy, and national independence against the U.S.-Japan military alliance is unfolding. The active actions of the Italian people in defense of democracy have proven the fighting determination of the workers. In France, the struggle for democracy and against the reactionary regime of personal dictatorship is intensifying. In the United States, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, India, Britain, Canada, Belgium, and other capitalist countries, workers are launching large-scale strikes. The struggle of American blacks for their living rights is becoming a mass movement. In Spain and Portugal, the trend towards the unity of all-national forces against fascist dictatorship is growing, and the democratic movement in Greece is strengthening. The military tyranny in Colombia and Venezuela has been overthrown, and the blatantly pro-American puppet governments in South Korea and Turkey have been struck. The national democratic movements against American imperialists and their lackeys are developing in South Vietnam and Laos. The Indonesian people are eliminating the economic positions of imperialists in their country, especially those of Dutch colonialists. The mass movement for the defense of peace is expanding, covering all continents. All this clearly shows that the tide of anti-imperialist struggle, national liberation struggle, anti-war struggle, and class struggle is rising higher and higher.

The victory of socialism in many countries in Eurasia, which account for one-third of humanity; the vigorous growth of the forces struggling for socialism all over the world; the continuous weakening of the positions of imperialism in the economic competition with socialism; the new upsurge of the national liberation movement and the rapid disintegration of the colonial system; the increasing instability of the entire capitalist world economic system; the sharpening of capitalist contradictions due to the development of state monopoly capitalism and the strengthening of militarism; the deepening of the contradictions between monopoly organizations and the interests of the whole nation; the narrowing of bourgeois democracy, the trend towards adopting authoritarian and fascist methods of rule; the profound political and ideological crisis of the bourgeoisie—all this shows that the general crisis of capitalism has entered a new stage. The characteristic of this stage is that it is not produced in connection with a world war, but in the competition and struggle between the two systems, the increasingly favorable balance of power for socialism, and the acute sharpening of all the contradictions of imperialism, under the conditions of the victorious struggle of the peace-loving forces for the realization and consolidation of peaceful coexistence, preventing imperialists from disrupting universal peace with their aggressive actions, under the conditions of the high tide of the struggle of the broad masses of the people for democracy, national liberation, and socialism.

All revolutionary forces are uniting to fight against the oppression and exploitation of imperialism. The peoples building socialism and communism, the revolutionary movement of the working class in capitalist countries, the national liberation struggles of the oppressed peoples, the general democratic movement—all these great forces of the present day are merging into a torrent that will sweep away and destroy the world imperialist system. At the center of the present era stands the international working class and its main product—the world socialist system. They are the guarantee of the victory of the struggle for peace, democracy, national liberation, socialism, and human progress.

II

The world socialist system has entered a new stage of development. The Soviet Union is successfully building a communist society in all respects. The other countries of the socialist camp are successfully laying the foundations of socialism, and some of them have entered the period of building a developed socialist society.

Socialism has achieved decisive victories throughout its system. These victories mark the victory of Marxism-Leninism, clearly showing the oppressed peoples of all countries that a society built on the basis of Marxist-Leninist doctrine opens up boundless possibilities for economic and cultural prosperity, for ensuring a high standard of living and peaceful happiness for people.

The Soviet people are successfully implementing the seven-year plan for the development of the national economy, rapidly building the material and technical foundations of communism. Soviet science has opened a new era in the development of world civilization, laying the foundation for the conquest of space, thus vividly demonstrating the economic and technological power of the socialist camp. The Soviet Union is the first in history to pave the way to communism for all humanity. The Soviet Union is the most brilliant example and the strongest bastion in the struggle of all peoples of the world for peace, democratic freedom, national independence, and social progress.

The people's revolution in China has dealt a devastating blow to the positions of imperialism in Asia, to a large extent promoting the change in the balance of power in favor of socialism. It has given a powerful impetus to the national liberation movement and has had a great impact on the peoples of all countries, especially the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

Together with the great Soviet Union, the other people's democratic republics that constitute a powerful socialist camp, namely Albania, Bulgaria, the German Democratic Republic, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, and the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, have achieved great successes in socialist construction in a short historical period.

The people's governments of these countries have proven their unshakable stability. Socialist production relations are playing a dominant role in the national economy; the phenomenon of man exploiting man has been permanently eliminated or is being successfully eliminated. Due to the successful implementation of the policy of socialist industrialization, the economies of the socialist countries have flourished, and their rates of economic development far exceed those of capitalist countries. All these countries have established developed industries; former agricultural countries have become or are becoming industrial and agricultural countries.

In recent years, all the people's democratic countries have successfully solved or are successfully solving the most difficult problems in socialist construction, namely, the transition of peasants from small private economies to large-scale socialist cooperative economies on a voluntary basis. Lenin's cooperative plan has shown its great vitality, whether for countries where the peasant land ownership consciousness is deeply rooted for a long time, or for countries that have recently eliminated feudal relations. The alliance of workers and peasants under the leadership of the working class has been strengthened, as V.I. Lenin taught, the maintenance and strengthening of this alliance is the highest principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat. In the process of socialist construction, this alliance of the two laboring classes, which is the political foundation of the socialist system, is constantly developing, promoting the further consolidation of the people's government under the leadership of the working class, promoting the socialist transformation of agriculture on the basis of voluntary cooperation of peasants according to Leninist principles.

The social structure has undergone a historic change. In the people's democratic countries, the landlord class and the bourgeoisie no longer exist. The working class has become the main force in society, its ranks are growing, and its level of consciousness and political maturity is increasing. Socialism has freed the peasants from generations of poverty, turning them into an active force for social progress. A new type of socialist intelligentsia, closely connected with the laboring people, is being formed. All citizens can freely acquire knowledge and culture. Thus, socialism has created not only political conditions but also material conditions for the cultural development of society, for the full and comprehensive development of human talents and abilities. The material living standards of the people are constantly improving on the basis of economic victories.

In multi-ethnic socialist countries, an unbreakable alliance has been formed and consolidated between the laboring peoples of all nationalities. The victory of Marxism-Leninism in the national policy of socialist countries, the true equality of all nationalities, and their economic and cultural upsurge are inspiring examples for the peoples fighting against national oppression.

In the people's democratic countries, socialist ideology has achieved significant successes in the struggle against bourgeois ideology. This struggle is long-term and will continue until people's consciousness is completely freed from the remnants of bourgeois ideology.

The political and moral unity of society, which was first created and consolidated in the Soviet Union and is now strengthening in other socialist countries, makes it possible to most effectively utilize the creative forces of free laborers to promote the development of productive forces and the prosperity of socialist society.

Socialist society is constantly improving and maturing. In this society, communist attitudes towards labor and other elements of future communist society are constantly emerging. The methods of leadership of the socialist economy and the methods of economic planning are constantly improving. Socialist democracy is further developing, the people's masses are more broadly involved in the leadership of economic and cultural construction, and the individual functions of the state are gradually transferred to social organizations.

Now, not only in the Soviet Union but also in other socialist countries, the possibility of the restoration of capitalism in the social and economic spheres has been eliminated. The united forces of the socialist camp reliably guarantee that each socialist country is not subject to the aggression of imperialist reactionary forces. Thus, the socialist countries have formed a united camp, the strengthening unity and increasing power of which guarantee the complete victory of socialism within the entire system.

In the past decades, the heroic labor of the working class and peasants, the great work of the Communist and Workers' Parties, have created extremely favorable objective possibilities for the further vigorous development of productive forces, for the maximum gain of time and victory in the peaceful economic competition of socialist countries with capitalism. The Marxist-Leninist parties leading the socialist countries consider it their duty to skillfully use these possibilities.

The Communist Parties of various countries, having achieved great victories and undergone serious trials, have accumulated rich and diverse experience in leading socialist construction. The achievements of the socialist countries and the entire socialist camp are due to the correct application of the common laws of socialist construction according to the historical characteristics of each country and the interests of the entire socialist system, due to the efforts of the peoples of these countries, due to their close fraternal cooperation and internationalist mutual aid, primarily due to the fraternal internationalist aid of the Soviet Union.

The experience of the development of socialist countries once again shows that the most important international conditions for their achievements and successes are: mutual assistance and mutual support, the use of all the advantages of the unity of the socialist camp countries. The hopes of imperialists, traitors, and revisionists for the possible split of the socialist camp are built on sand and are doomed to failure. All socialist countries protect the unity of the socialist camp like the apple of their eye.

The world socialist economic system is based on the commonality of socialist production relations and is developing on the basis of the laws of the socialist economy. To ensure the victorious development of this system, it is necessary: in socialist construction, to consistently apply the law of planned and proportional development; to unleash the creative initiative of the masses; on the basis of voluntarism, mutual benefit, and the constant improvement of the level of science and technology, through the implementation of the coordination of national economic plans within the framework of the world socialist system, as well as the specialization and cooperation of production, to constantly improve the international division of labor; to study collective experience; to strengthen cooperation and fraternal mutual aid; on this basis, to gradually overcome the historical differences in the levels of economic development of the countries and to create the material basis for the approximately simultaneous transition of the peoples of the socialist system to communism.

On the basis of the practice of socialist construction in various countries, the collective experience of the entire socialist camp has been accumulated. The fraternal parties study this experience comprehensively and, on the basis of specific conditions and national characteristics, creatively apply and enrich it, which is an unshakable law of the development of each socialist country.

The Communist and Workers' Parties of the socialist countries consider it their international duty: to develop the industrial and agricultural production of each country at the highest possible speed on the basis of existing possibilities, to fully utilize all the advantages of the socialist system and the domestic resources of each country, in order to solve a historical task through joint efforts in the shortest possible time, namely, to surpass the world capitalist system in terms of absolute production of industry and agriculture, and then to surpass the economically most developed capitalist countries in terms of production level and standard of living per capita. To solve this task, it is necessary to constantly improve political and economic work, to constantly improve the methods of leadership of the national economy, to have a socialist management method based on science, that is, to constantly increase labor productivity on the basis of continuous technological progress, to manage the economy on a planned basis, to consistently adhere to Lenin's principle of material interest, and to develop spiritual incentives for labor beneficial to society through the improvement of the political consciousness of the masses, to monitor the quantity of labor and consumption.

The necessary material basis for the transition of the socialist countries to communism is: on the basis of the latest advanced technology, the electrification of the national economy, the mechanization and automation of production, to create a high level of production. Without all this, it is impossible to ensure the abundance of consumer goods necessary for a communist society. On this basis, it is necessary to develop communist social relations, to fully raise the political consciousness of the masses, to cultivate the new man of communist society.

The socialist camp is a union of free and sovereign peoples of various countries, united by close socialist international solidarity and the unity of common interests and goals, advancing along the path of socialism and communism in the social, economic, and political spheres. Strict adherence to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and socialist internationalism is the unbreakable rule of the mutual relations of socialist countries. In the socialist camp, each country participating in this camp enjoys true equality and independence. The socialist countries, on the basis of complete equality, mutual benefit, and fraternal mutual aid, make their comprehensive economic, political, and cultural cooperation more perfect, which is in the interests of each socialist country and in the interests of the entire socialist camp.

One of the greatest achievements of the world socialist system is that it has proven in practice the Marxist-Leninist principle that national antagonism disappears with the disappearance of class antagonism. The antagonistic, war-leading contradictions between classes and classes, nations and nations, states and states are inherent in the capitalist system. In contrast to the laws of the capitalist system, the socialist system, in its essence, does not have objective reasons for contradictions and conflicts between the peoples or states of this system. The development of this system makes the peoples and nations of various countries increasingly united, makes the various forms of their cooperation increasingly consolidated. Socialism organically combines the development of the economy, culture, and state system of its own country with the interests of the consolidation and development of the entire world socialist system, with the increasing unity of the nations. The interests of the entire socialist system and the national interests of the countries are harmoniously combined. The political and moral unity of the peoples of the socialist family is produced on this basis and is constantly consolidated on this basis. The brotherly friendship and mutual aid of the peoples of the socialist countries, generated by the socialist system, replace the political fragmentation and national egoism inherent in capitalism.

The common interests of the peoples of the socialist countries, the interests of socialism and the cause of peace, require that the principles of socialist internationalism be correctly combined with the principles of socialist patriotism in policy. Each ruling Communist Party is responsible for the fate of its own country and for the fate of the entire socialist camp.

The 1957 Declaration correctly pointed out that exaggerating the role of national characteristics, departing from the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism about the socialist revolution and socialist construction, will cause damage to the common cause of socialism. At the same time, the Declaration also correctly pointed out that Marxism-Leninism requires the creative application of the common principles of the socialist revolution and socialist construction according to the specific historical conditions of each country, does not allow the mechanical copying of the policies and strategies of other countries' Communist Parties. A proletarian party that ignores national characteristics will deviate from life, deviate from the masses, and will cause damage to the cause of socialism.

The manifestations of nationalism and national limitations will not automatically disappear with the establishment of the socialist system. To consolidate the brotherly relations and friendship between the socialist countries, the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries must implement the internationalist policy of Marxism-Leninism, educate all laborers with the spirit of combining internationalism and patriotism, and resolutely fight against the remnants of bourgeois nationalism and chauvinism.

The Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries tirelessly educate laborers with the spirit of socialist internationalism, with the spirit of uncompromising struggle against all manifestations of nationalism and chauvinism. The unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the socialist countries and the peoples, their loyalty to the teachings of Marxism-Leninism, is the main source of the strength and invincibility of each socialist country and the entire socialist camp.

The peoples of the socialist countries are paving the way to communism, creating a prototype of a new society for all humanity. The laborers of the capitalist world are extremely concerned about the creative activities of the builders of socialism and communism. This makes the Marxist-Leninist parties and peoples of the socialist countries responsible for the victorious construction of socialism and communism before the international workers' movement.

The Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries regard it as their task to tirelessly consolidate the socialist family of the peoples of various countries, whose international influence and impact on the course of world events are increasing year by year.

The moment has come when the socialist countries have formed a world system and have become an international force with a powerful influence on world development. The real possibility of solving the most important problems of the present day in new ways favorable to peace, democracy, and socialism has appeared.

III

The most urgent problem of our era is the problem of war and peace.

War is a constant companion of capitalism. The system of man exploiting man and the system of man killing man are two sides of the capitalist system. Imperialism has already subjected humanity to the horrors of two world wars and now threatens humanity with even more terrible disasters. Horrifying weapons of mass destruction and annihilation have already been created. The use of such weapons in a new war will cause unprecedented destruction to entire countries, turning the great centers of world production and world culture into ruins. Such a war will bring death and suffering to hundreds of millions of people, including the peoples of countries that have not participated in the war. Imperialism poses a serious danger to all humanity.

Now, more than ever, the peoples of all countries must maintain an especially high degree of vigilance. As long as imperialism exists, there is a soil for aggressive wars.

The peoples of all countries are well aware that the danger of a new world war has not passed. The main forces of aggression and war are American imperialism. Its policy embodies the ideas of the warmongering reactionaries. With the participation of British, French, and West German imperialists, under the pretext of defending against the "communist threat," American imperialism has drawn many countries into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Central Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and other military alliances, and has filled the entire so-called "free world," that is, the capitalist countries subordinate to it, with its military bases, primarily directed against the socialist countries. The existence of these alliances and bases threatens universal peace and security, not only violating the sovereignty of those countries that provide their territory to American militarists as bases, but also threatening the existence of those countries.

The imperialist forces of America, Britain, and France are engaged in criminal collusion with West German imperialism. In West Germany, militarism has been revived, and a large regular army commanded by Hitler's generals is being rapidly rebuilt. American imperialists are arming this army with rocket nuclear weapons and other most modern weapons of mass destruction. This is causing increasingly strong and resolute resistance from the peace-loving peoples of all countries. In France and other Western European countries, military bases are being provided for this army of aggression. The threat to the peace and security of the peoples of Europe from West German imperialism is increasing. The revanchists of West Germany openly declare that they intend to revise the borders that have already been determined after the Second World War. Like the Hitler gang of old, the West German militarists are preparing for war against the socialist countries and other European countries, striving to realize their aggressive plans. West Berlin has become a source of international provocations. The Bonn government has become the main enemy of peaceful coexistence, disarmament, and the easing of tensions in Europe.

All peace-loving countries and peoples of Europe must unite their forces to counter the aggressive plans of West German imperialism. In the struggle against the aggressive ambitions of West German militarism, the German Democratic Republic plays a particularly important role. The conference participants believe that it is the duty of all socialist countries and all peace-loving peoples to ensure that the German Democratic Republic, the true embodiment of the peaceful aspirations of the German people, is not subjected to aggression.

American imperialists are also actively reviving the sources of war in the Far East. They violate the national independence of the Japanese people, against the will of the Japanese people, collude with the Japanese reactionary ruling clique, and impose a new military treaty on Japan. This treaty aims to invade the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other peace-loving countries. American bandits have occupied Taiwan, which belongs to the People's Republic of China, and have occupied South Korea. They are increasingly interfering in the affairs of South Vietnam, turning these countries into dangerous sources of military provocations and military adventures. American imperialists are threatening to invade Cuba, interfering in the internal affairs of the peoples of Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East, striving to create new sources of war everywhere. American imperialists use regional alliances like the Organization of American States to maintain their economic and political control over the countries of Latin America and to drag these countries into the implementation of their aggressive designs.

American imperialism has established a huge war machine and is unwilling to reduce these machines. Imperialists sabotage any constructive proposals of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries aimed at disarmament. The arms race is continuing. Nuclear weapons reserves are increasing alarmingly. The ruling clique of France, despite the protests of the peoples of their own country and other countries, especially the peoples of the African continent, has embarked on the path of manufacturing and testing atomic weapons. American militarists are preparing to resume harmful atomic tests. Military provocations that contain the danger of serious international conflicts are continuing.

The ruling clique of the United States, with its policy of provocation and aggression, sabotaged the Paris summit of government heads, adopting a policy of exacerbating international tensions and sharpening the "Cold War." The threat of war has intensified. Imperialist provocations against peace have aroused the anger and resistance of the peoples of all countries; American imperialism has further exposed its true face, and its influence in the world has suffered new serious blows.

The aggressive nature of imperialism has not changed. However, real forces capable of crushing its aggressive plans have already formed. The inevitability of war is not predetermined. If according to the will of the imperialists, they would have long pushed humanity into the abyss of new world war disasters and horrors. However, the era when imperialists could arbitrarily decide whether war would occur has passed. In recent years, imperialists have launched local wars more than once, bringing humanity to the brink of world disaster. The firm stance of the Soviet Union, other socialist countries, and all peace-loving forces has stopped the aggression of Britain, France, and Israel against Egypt, prevented the military aggression of imperialists against Syria, Iraq, and other countries. The heroic Algerian people are continuing their brave struggle for independence and freedom. The peoples of the Congo and Laos are giving increasingly resolute rebuffs to the criminal actions of imperialists. Experience has shown that it is possible to effectively resist the local wars launched by imperialists and to eliminate the sources of such wars.

The time has come to stop the imperialist aggressors from realizing their plans for a world war. The joint efforts of the world socialist camp, the international working class, the national liberation movement, all anti-war countries, and all peace-loving forces can prevent a world war.

The development of international relations in our era is determined by the struggle between two social systems, by the struggle of the forces of socialism, peace, and democracy against the forces of imperialism, reaction, and aggression, in which the forces of socialism, peace, and democracy are increasingly clearly dominant.

For the first time in history, there are great organized forces fighting against war, these forces are: the powerful Soviet Union, which occupies a leading position in the decisive fields of science and technology; the entire socialist camp, which serves the cause of peace with its powerful material and political forces; the increasingly numerous peace-loving countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, which are deeply concerned about the maintenance of peace; the international working class and its various organizations, primarily the Communist Parties; the national liberation movements of the colonial and dependent countries; the world movement for peace; neutral countries that do not agree with the imperialist policy of waging war and advocate peaceful coexistence. A part of the bourgeoisie in developed capitalist countries, which soberly assesses the balance of power and the dire consequences of modern war, also expresses its support for the policy of peaceful coexistence. To maintain world peace, it is necessary to establish the broadest united front to defend peace and oppose the policy of imperialist aggression and war advocated by American imperialism. The unity and active actions of all peace-loving forces can maintain peace and prevent new wars.

Now, for all democratic and peace-loving forces, there is no more urgent task than to save humanity from nuclear disaster. The unprecedented destructive power of modern military technology urgently requires that the main actions of all anti-war and peace-loving forces be concentrated on preventing war. It is not possible to delay the struggle against war until it breaks out, because then it will be too late for many regions of the world and their inhabitants to fight. Do not wait until the atomic and hydrogen bombs are dropped, and then start the struggle against the danger of a new world war. This struggle must be waged now, and it must be waged with increasing effort every day. The main thing is to timely subdue the aggressors, prevent war, and not allow it to break out.

Today, fighting for peace means maintaining the highest degree of vigilance, tirelessly exposing the policies of imperialism, vigilantly watching the tricks and intrigues of the war provocateurs, arousing the sacred indignation of the peoples of the world against those who persist in the policy of war, raising the organizational level of all peace-loving forces, constantly strengthening the active actions of the masses to defend peace, and strengthening cooperation with all countries that do not want a new war. In countries where imperialists have established military bases, it is necessary to strengthen the struggle to abolish these military bases, which is an important condition for consolidating national independence, maintaining sovereignty, and preventing war. The struggle of the peoples of various countries against the militarization of their own countries should be combined with the struggle against the capitalist monopoly organizations connected with American imperialists. Now, more than ever, it is important to wage an unyielding struggle within each country to make the movement for the defense of peace continuously strengthen and expand in cities and villages, enterprises, and institutions. The movement for the defense of peace is the broadest movement of the present day, which unites people with different political and religious beliefs, belonging to different social classes, but united by the desire to prevent new wars and ensure lasting peace.

Further strengthening the world socialist system is of primary importance for maintaining lasting peace. Before disarmament is achieved, the socialist countries must still maintain their defensive forces at the necessary level.

Communists believe that, in order to ensure the cause of peace, it is first necessary to solve the following tasks: stop the arms race; prohibit atomic weapons and their testing and production; abolish foreign military bases; withdraw foreign troops from the territories of other countries; dissolve military alliances; sign a peace treaty with Germany; make West Berlin a demilitarized free city; stop the aggressive plots of West German revanchists; do not allow Japanese militarism to revive.

History has placed the great responsibility of preventing a new world war primarily on the shoulders of the international working class. Imperialists are uniting and conspiring to launch a thermonuclear war. The international working class should unite its ranks and save humanity from the disaster of a new world war. No differences in political, religious, and other issues should hinder the unity of all the forces of the working class to resist the danger of war. The moment has come to oppose the forces of war with the strong will and united actions of all the ranks and organizations of the international proletariat, to unite all the forces of the international proletariat to prevent war and maintain peace!

The Communist Parties of various countries regard the struggle for peace as their primary task. They call on the working class, trade unions, cooperatives, women's and youth organizations, and all working people, regardless of their political views and religious beliefs, to give a resolute rebuff to any aggressive actions of imperialists through mass struggles.

If the imperialist maniacs start a war, the peoples of the world will clear away and bury capitalism.

The principle of peaceful coexistence and economic competition between socialist countries and capitalist countries, proposed by Lenin, is the unshakable foundation of the foreign policy of the socialist countries. Under conditions of peace, the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system in all aspects of economics, culture, and science and technology is increasingly manifesting itself. In the near future, the forces of peace and socialism will achieve new successes. The Soviet Union will become the world's first industrial power. China will become a powerful industrial country. The industrial products of the socialist system will account for more than half of the world's industrial products. The peace zone will further expand. The workers' movement in the capitalist countries and the national liberation movement in the colonies and dependent countries will achieve new victories. The colonial system will completely collapse. The forces of socialism and peace will occupy an absolute advantage. Under these conditions, before socialism achieves complete victory on Earth, in the situation where capitalism still exists in some regions of the world, there will be a real possibility of excluding world war from social life. The victory of socialism in the world will finally eliminate all social and national causes of any war.

All communists of the world unanimously and consistently adhere to peaceful coexistence and resolutely struggle to prevent war. Communists should tirelessly work among the masses to avoid underestimating the possibility of preventing world war, the possibility of peaceful coexistence, as well as avoiding underestimating the danger of war.

In the situation where the world is divided into two systems, the only correct and sensible principle in international relations is the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems proposed by V.I. Lenin. This principle was further developed in the 1957 Moscow Declaration and Peace Declaration, in the resolutions of the 20th and 21st Congresses of the CPSU, and in the documents of other Communist and Workers' Parties.

The five principles of peaceful coexistence jointly proposed by the People's Republic of China and the Republic of India, as well as the principles adopted at the Bandung Conference, are in the interests of peace and peace-loving peoples.

The question is now posed as follows: peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems or destructive war—there is no other way out. Communists resolutely oppose American "Cold War" and "war on the brink of war" policy because it is a policy leading to thermonuclear disaster. While adhering to the principle of peaceful coexistence, communists strive for the complete cessation of the "Cold War," the dissolution of military alliances, the abolition of military bases, the complete and thorough disarmament under international supervision, the resolution of international disputes through negotiations, the respect for the equality, territorial integrity, independence, and sovereignty of each country, the non-interference in internal affairs, and the broad development of trade, cultural, and scientific relations between the peoples of various countries.

The policy of peaceful coexistence is in the fundamental interests of the peoples of all countries, in the fundamental interests of all those who do not want new bloody wars and strive for lasting peace. This policy helps to consolidate the positions of socialism, helps to increase the prestige and international influence of the socialist countries, and raises the authority and influence of the Communist Parties in the capitalist countries. Peace is a faithful ally of socialism because time is on the side of socialism and against capitalism.

The line of peaceful coexistence is the line of mobilizing the masses to take active actions against the enemies of peace.

Title: On the Declaration of the World Communist Parties and Workers' Parties

The peaceful coexistence of countries does not, as revisionists claim, mean abandoning class struggle. The coexistence of countries with different social systems is a form of class struggle between socialism and capitalism. Under conditions of peaceful coexistence, there are opportunities to advance class struggle in capitalist countries and to advance national liberation movements in colonies and dependent countries. At the same time, the achievements of revolutionary class struggle and national liberation struggle promote the consolidation of peaceful coexistence. Communists consider it their duty to strengthen the confidence of the people in the possibility of consolidating peaceful coexistence and to strengthen the people's determination to prevent world war. They will strive to promote the active struggle of the people for peace, democracy, and national liberation, gradually weakening and reducing the positions of imperialism.

The peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems does not mean the reconciliation of socialist and bourgeois ideologies. On the contrary, it requires the working class and all communist parties to strengthen the struggle for the victory of socialist ideology. However, ideological and political disputes between countries should not be resolved by war.

The conference believes that the implementation of the comprehensive and thorough disarmament plan proposed by the Soviet Union will have historic significance for human destiny. The implementation of this plan would mean the elimination of the possibility of war between countries. The implementation of this plan is not easy. It faces the stubborn resistance of the imperialists. Therefore, an active and resolute struggle must be waged against the imperialist forces of aggression to achieve this plan. This struggle must be increasingly broadened, and persistent efforts must be made to achieve concrete results—prohibition of nuclear weapons testing and production, dissolution of military alliances and military bases on foreign soil, significant reduction of armed forces and armaments, and paving the way for universal disarmament. The socialist countries, other peace-loving countries, the international working class, and the broad masses of the people will wage an active and resolute struggle to isolate the aggressor groups, frustrate the preparations for war, and force the imperialists to accept agreements on universal disarmament.

The arms race is neither a factor in preventing war nor a factor in high employment and welfare for the people. The arms race leads to war. Only a small group of monopolists and arms speculators are enthusiastic about the arms race. In capitalist countries, the demand to reduce military spending and use the savings to improve the living conditions of the people is a constant demand of the people. In every country, a broad mass movement must be launched to use the money and resources saved from disarmament for peaceful production, housing construction, health services, national education, social security, and the development of scientific research. Now, disarmament has become a fighting demand of the people, a historical necessity that has matured. The imperialists must be forced to implement this demand of the people with active and resolute struggle!

The communist parties of the socialist countries will continue to adhere to the line of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, doing everything possible to spare the peoples of various countries from the horrors and disasters of a new war. They will be vigilant against imperialism, strengthen the power and defensive capabilities of the entire socialist camp, and take all necessary measures to ensure the security of the peoples of various countries and maintain peace.

Communists consider their historical mission not only to eliminate exploitation and poverty on a global scale and to permanently eliminate any possibility of war from human social life but also to free humanity from the scourge of a new world war in the present era. The communist parties of various countries will contribute all their strength and energy to achieve this great historical mission.

The victory of national liberation revolutions in vast regions of the world has been achieved. In the fifteen years since the war, nearly forty new sovereign states have emerged in Asia and Africa. The victory of the Cuban Revolution has greatly promoted the struggle of the Latin American peoples for complete national liberation. A new historical period has begun in human life: the peoples who have gained independence in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are actively participating in international politics.

The complete collapse of colonialism is inevitable. Under the impact of the national liberation movements, the disintegration of the colonial slave system, in terms of its historical significance, is second only to the formation of the world socialist system.

The great October Socialist Revolution awakened the East and drew the colonial peoples into the world revolutionary movement. The victory of the Soviet Union in the Second World War, the establishment of people's democratic regimes in a series of countries in Europe and Asia, the victory of the Chinese socialist revolution, and the formation of the world socialist system have greatly accelerated this process. The power of world socialism has played a decisive role in promoting the struggle of the colonial and dependent peoples for liberation from imperialist oppression. The socialist system has become a reliable rear guard for the peoples who have gained independence to realize independent and autonomous national development. The international workers' movement has given great support to the national liberation movement.

The face of Asia has undergone fundamental changes. The colonial system in Africa is collapsing. In Latin America, a line of active anti-imperialist struggle has been opened. The independence of hundreds of millions of people in Asia, Africa, and other regions of the world is the result of their struggle against imperialism. Communists have always recognized the progressive and revolutionary significance of national liberation wars and have been the most active fighters for national independence. The existence of the world socialist system and the weakening of the imperialist positions have opened up new possibilities for the oppressed peoples to struggle for independence.

The peoples of the colonies, based on their specific conditions, strive for their independence through armed struggle or non-war means. They must achieve a solid victory on the basis of a strong national liberation movement. Colonial powers will not grant freedom to the colonial peoples and will not voluntarily relinquish the countries they exploit.

The United States is the main bastion of modern colonialism. The imperialists led by the United States desperately use new methods and new forms to maintain colonialist exploitation of the former colonial peoples. Monopolistic organizations attempt to keep the economic control and political influence in their hands in the countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The purpose of these efforts is to maintain their original positions and seize new positions in the economies of these countries under the guise of economic "aid," to pull the already independent countries into military alliances, to establish military bases, and to support military dictatorships in these countries. Imperialists attempt to castrate and destroy the sovereignty of the already independent countries, distort the meaning of national self-determination, and under the banner of "mutual dependence," impose new forms of colonialist rule, support their own puppets in power, buy off a part of the bourgeoisie, and use the evil weapon of national disputes to weaken these young and not yet consolidated countries. Aggressive military alliances and aggressive bilateral military alliances are being actively used to achieve these purposes. The most reactionary groups in the local exploiting classes are accomplices of the imperialists.

Countries that have freed themselves from colonial oppression can only solve the urgent tasks of national revival by decisively struggling against imperialism and the remnants of feudalism, uniting all patriotic forces of the nation into a national democratic united front. Consolidating political independence, carrying out land reforms in the interests of the peasants, eliminating feudal remnants, eradicating the economic roots of imperialist rule, limiting foreign monopolistic organizations and expelling them from the economy, establishing and developing national industries, improving the living standards of the residents, democratizing social life, pursuing an independent and peaceful foreign policy, and developing economic and cultural cooperation with socialist countries and other friendly countries—these national democratic tasks are the basis on which the progressive forces of the various countries that have gained independence can unite and are actually uniting.

In the struggle for national liberation, the working class, which has played an outstanding role, advocates carrying the tasks of national, anti-imperialist, and democratic revolution to the end and opposing the attempts of reactionary forces to obstruct the progress of society. Solving the peasant problem, which directly affects the interests of the majority of the population, is of paramount importance to these countries. Without a thorough land reform, it is impossible to solve the food problem and to eliminate all medieval remnants that hinder the development of agricultural and industrial productive forces. In these countries, it is of great significance to establish and expand the state-owned component in the national economy, especially in industry, on a democratic basis, which does not depend on foreign monopolistic organizations and gradually becomes the decisive factor in the national economy.

The alliance of workers and peasants is the most important force in the struggle for and defense of national independence, the realization of profound democratic reforms, and the guarantee of social progress. This alliance should be the basis for a broad national united front. The degree to which the national bourgeoisie participates in the liberation struggle also depends to a considerable extent on the strength and solidity of this alliance. In this struggle, all national patriotic forces, all those in the country who are ready to fight for national independence and against imperialism, can play a great role.

Under the current conditions, the national bourgeoisie of the colonies and dependent countries, which has no connection with the imperialist groups, objectively has a common interest with the realization of the basic tasks of anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution, and can participate in the revolutionary struggle against imperialism and feudalism. In this sense, the national bourgeoisie has a progressive character. However, it is vacillating; in addition to having a progressive character, it also tends to compromise with imperialism and feudalism. Due to the two-faced nature of the national bourgeoisie, its participation in the revolution varies in different countries. This depends on the specific conditions, the changes in the balance of class forces, the sharpness of the contradictions between the imperialists, feudalists, and the people, and the depth of the contradictions between the imperialists, feudalists, and the national bourgeoisie.

After the people gain political independence, they will seek answers to social problems in real life and to the problem of consolidating national independence. Different classes and parties propose different solutions. The choice of which path to take is an internal matter for the peoples of various countries. As social contradictions sharpen, the national bourgeoisie increasingly tends to compromise with the domestic reactionaries and imperialists. The people, however, are convinced that the best way to eliminate long-term backwardness and improve their living conditions is the non-capitalist path of development. Only by taking this path can the people free themselves from exploitation, poverty, and hunger. In solving this fundamental social problem, the working class and the broad masses of peasants should play the most important role.

Under the current historical conditions, favorable international and domestic conditions are being created for the establishment of independent national democratic states in many countries. Such an independent national democratic state is one that consistently upholds its political and economic independence, opposes imperialism and its military alliances, opposes foreign military bases on its territory, opposes all new forms of colonialism, opposes the infiltration of imperialist capital, rejects authoritarian and dictatorial methods of management, guarantees the people broad democratic rights and freedoms (freedom of speech, press, assembly, demonstration, and the formation of parties and social organizations), guarantees the people the possibility of achieving land reform and other democratic and social reforms, and participating in determining the policies of the state. The establishment and consolidation of national democratic states enable these countries to develop rapidly along the path of social progress and to play an active role in the struggle of the peoples of various countries for peace, against the aggressive policies of the imperialist camp, and for the complete elimination of colonialist slavery. The communist parties are actively struggling for a thorough anti-imperialist and anti-feudal democratic revolution, for the establishment of national democratic states, and for the decisive improvement of the living conditions of the people. They support the actions of national governments to consolidate the achievements already made and to break the positions of imperialism. At the same time, they actively oppose anti-democratic and anti-people's actions, oppose measures of the ruling class that harm national independence. Communists expose the attempts of the reactionaries in the bourgeoisie to pass off selfish, narrow class interests as the interests of the entire nation, expose the bourgeois politicians who use socialist slogans to deceive and mislead, and strive for the true democratization of social life, uniting all progressive forces to fight against dictatorship or prevent the trend towards the establishment of such a regime.

The communist parties' goals are in line with the highest interests of the nation. Reactionary groups attempt to break up the national front under the banner of "anti-communism," isolating the most advanced part of the liberation movement—the communists. This attempt weakens the strength of the national movement, goes against the national interests of the people, and puts the already achieved national gains in danger of being lost.

The socialist countries are the sincere and loyal friends of the peoples who are struggling for liberation or have freed themselves from imperialist oppression and tyranny. They fundamentally oppose any interference in the internal affairs of young national states and consider it their international duty to promote the struggle of the peoples of various countries to consolidate national independence. They provide great assistance and support to these countries in developing and consolidating their national economy, cultivating their own cadres, and in cooperating with these countries in the struggle for world peace and against imperialist aggression.

The awakened workers of the metropolises have always fought for the self-determination of the peoples oppressed by imperialism, recognizing that "a nation that oppresses other nations cannot be free." Now, when these nations have embarked on the path of national independence, the international duty of the workers and all democratic forces of the industrially developed capitalist countries is to give full support to the struggle of these nations for national independence and the consolidation of national independence, helping them to solve the tasks of economic and cultural revival. They do this while also defending the interests of their own people.

The complete and thorough elimination of all forms and manifestations of the colonialist system is required by the entire historical process of the world in recent decades. For all peoples still under colonial oppression, full support should be given to their struggle for national independence. All forms of colonial oppression must be abolished. The elimination of colonialism will have extremely great significance for easing international tensions and consolidating universal peace. The conference expresses support for all the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Australia who are waging heroic anti-imperialist struggles. The conference pays tribute to the young peoples of Africa who have gained political independence, which is an important step towards their complete liberation. The conference expresses warm sympathy and support for the heroic people of Algeria who are fighting for freedom and national independence, demanding an immediate halt to the aggression against Algeria. The conference angrily condemns the inhuman racial persecution and tyranny of the South African Union, the so-called "apartheid" system, and calls on the international democratic public to actively support the struggle of the South African people for freedom and equality. The conference demands that the sovereignty of the peoples of Cuba, Congo, and all other countries that have gained independence be respected.

All socialist countries, the international workers' movement, and the communist movement consider it their duty to provide moral and material support to the peoples who are struggling to free themselves from imperialist and colonial oppression.

Five
The new balance of power on the world stage provides new opportunities for the communist and workers' parties to solve their historical tasks of struggling for peace, national independence, democracy, and socialism.

The communist parties of various countries, based on the specific historical and social conditions of their own countries and considering the international situation, determine the prospects and tasks of the revolution. They wage a selfless struggle to defend the interests of the working class and the people in the current conditions, to improve their living conditions, and to expand the democratic rights and freedoms of the people, without postponing these things until the victory of socialism. The working class and its revolutionary vanguard recognize that they bear the primary responsibility for struggling to free their own people from capitalist oppression and will launch increasingly powerful attacks on the rule of the oppressors and exploiters in all fields of political, economic, and ideological life in their own country. In this struggle, the masses are tempered, and conditions are created for the decisive battle to overthrow capitalism and achieve the victory of the socialist revolution.

Under the current conditions, the main blows are increasingly directed against the monopolistic organizations of capitalism, which are the culprits of the arms race and the bastions of reaction and aggression. In some developed capitalist countries outside Europe that are under the political, economic, and military domination of American imperialism, the main blows of the working class and the people are directed against the rule of American imperialism and against the domestic monopolistic capital and other reactionary forces that betray national interests. In this struggle, all democratic and patriotic national forces, that is, the forces struggling for true national independence and the victory of the democratic revolution, unite in a united front; and the achievement of true national independence and democracy will create conditions for solving the tasks of the socialist revolution.

The monopolistic organizations are launching a full-scale attack on the interests of the working class and the broad masses of the people. The exploitation of the workers is increasing, and the process of the impoverishment of the broad peasant masses is accelerating; at the same time, the difficulties faced by the urban petty bourgeoisie are increasing. The oppression of the monopolistic organizations is becoming increasingly heavy for all classes of the nation. As a result, while the fundamental class contradictions in bourgeois society, that is, the contradictions between labor and capital, are constantly sharpening, the contradictions between a small group of monopolistic capitalists and all classes of the people are also deepening in the current stage.

The monopolistic organizations are trying to eliminate or severely restrict the democratic rights of the people. In some countries, open fascist terror continues to rage. In some countries, the process of fascization is being strengthened in the following new forms: authoritarian methods of rule are combined with a sham parliamentary system, which has no democratic content. Many democratic organizations are declared illegal, forced to go underground, and thousands of fighters for the cause of the working class and the cause of peace are thrown into prison.

The conference, on behalf of all communists in the world, expresses proletarian sympathy to the glorious sons of the working class and democrats who are being tortured in prisons in the United States, Spain, Portugal, Japan, West Germany, Greece, Iran, Pakistan, the United Arab Republic, Jordan, Iraq, Argentina, Paraguay, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, the Union of South Africa, Sudan, and other countries. The conference calls for a powerful international movement to demand the release of fighters for peace, national independence, and democracy.

The working class, peasants, intellectuals, and urban petty bourgeoisie all have a direct stake in the elimination of the rule of the monopolistic organizations. Favorable conditions for uniting these forces are being created.

Communists believe that such unity is completely achievable, and its basis is: the struggle for peace; the struggle for national independence; the defense and development of democracy; the struggle for the nationalization and democratization of the management of the most important economic sectors; the struggle to use the entire economy for peaceful purposes to meet the needs of the residents; the struggle for thorough land reform; the struggle to improve the living conditions of the working people; the struggle to protect the interests of the peasants and the urban petty bourgeoisie from the harm of the monopolistic organizations.

The realization of all this will be an important step on the path of social progress and will be in the interests of the majority of the nation. All this has a democratic character and does not eliminate the exploitation of man by man. However, the realization of all this will limit the power of the monopolistic organizations, increase the prestige and political weight of the working class in national life, and help to isolate the most reactionary forces and unite all progressive forces. The participation of broad strata of the population in the struggle for democratic reforms will make them convinced of the necessity of united action with the working class, will help to raise their political activity, and the most important duty of the working class and its communist vanguard is to lead the masses in the struggle for democratic reforms, to overthrow the rule of the monopolistic organizations, and to ensure the success of this struggle.

Communists advocate the democratization of economic life and social life, as well as all administrative, political, cultural organizations, and institutions.

Communists consider the struggle for democracy to be a component of the struggle for socialism. In this struggle, communists constantly strengthen their ties with the masses, raise the political consciousness of the masses, make the masses understand the tasks of the socialist revolution and the necessity of achieving this revolution. The fundamental difference between Marxist-Leninist parties and reformists lies in this. Reformists consider reforms within the capitalist system to be the ultimate goal and deny the necessity of the socialist revolution. Marxist-Leninists firmly believe that the people of capitalist countries will recognize in the process of their daily struggles that only socialism is their true way out.

Now, when more and more strata of the population are actively involved in class struggle, it is of great importance for communists to strengthen their work among the unions, cooperatives, peasants, youth, women, sports organizations, and the unorganized residents. Now there are new opportunities to attract the younger generation to the struggle for peace and democracy, for the great ideal of communism. Lenin's great legacy—to go deep into the masses, where there are masses, to work there, to strengthen the ties with the masses, in order to lead them forward, should be the most important task of every communist.

In countries where the labor movement is divided and internationally, the restoration of the unity of the labor movement is of paramount importance for increasing the political weight of the working class in political life and for successfully defending the interests of the working class. Workers belonging to different unions have common interests. In the greatest class battles of recent years, it is precisely because of their unity that they have achieved the satisfaction of the demands of the workers. Communists believe that there are real prerequisites for the restoration of labor unity and will persistently strive for the achievement of this task. In those countries where there is practically no union democracy, the struggle for labor unity requires constant work to achieve the independence of the labor movement and to ensure that the union rights of all workers are recognized and respected, without political or any other discrimination.

The interests of the cause of peace and social progress also require the restoration of the unity of all other mass democratic movements within the country and internationally. On the basis of united action in the struggle for peace, national independence, the defense and expansion of democratic rights, the improvement of the living conditions of the workers, and the expansion of their social rights, the unity of mass organizations can be achieved.

The alliance of the working class and the laboring peasantry, as the main driving force of the social revolution, plays a decisive role in the struggle of the people of capitalist countries for the achievement of their tasks.

The division of the working class remains the main obstacle to the achievement of their goals. The ruling class, the right-wing leaders of the Social Democratic Party, and the reactionary leaders of the unions are eager to maintain this division both in their own country and internationally. Communists firmly advocate the overcoming of this division.

The imperialists and the reactionaries of various countries, while using repressive measures to divide and destroy the unity of the working class, also use deception and bribery. Recent events have once again proved that this division will undermine the positions of the working class and only benefit the imperialist reactionaries.

Some right-wing leaders of the Social Democratic Party have openly turned to the position of imperialism, defending the capitalist system, dividing the working class. Due to their enmity towards communism and fear of the growing influence of socialism on the world stage, they surrender to the reactionary conservative forces. In some countries, the right-wing leadership has led the Social Democratic Party to adopt a platform that openly renounces Marxism and class struggle, renounces traditional socialist slogans. They once again serve the bourgeoisie. Resistance to the policy of the right-wing leaders is growing within the Social Democratic Party, and a part of its workers are also participating in this resistance. The forces that support the actions of the working class and other laborers in the struggle for peace, democracy, and social progress are growing. The vast majority of the Social Democratic Party, especially the workers, support peace and social progress.

Communists will continue to criticize the ideological positions and right-wing opportunist practices of the Social Democratic Party and will continue to work to bring the masses of the Social Democratic Party to the position of waging a thorough class struggle against capitalism for the victory of socialism. Communists are convinced that their ideological differences with the Social Democratic Party should not hinder the exchange of views on mature issues of the labor movement, on common struggles, especially the struggle against the danger of war.

Communists consider the workers of the Social Democratic Party to be their class brothers. Communists often work together with them in unions and other organizations and wage a common struggle for the interests of the working class and all the people.

The fundamental interests of the labor movement urgently require that the communist and Social Democratic parties take joint action at home and abroad to immediately ban the production, testing, and use of nuclear weapons, establish nuclear-free zones, achieve comprehensive and thorough disarmament under international supervision, dissolve military bases on foreign soil, withdraw foreign troops, aid the national liberation movements of the colonial and dependent peoples, guarantee national sovereignty, strengthen democracy, and repel the fascist threat, raise the living standards of the workers, and reduce the working week without reducing wages, etc. Millions of Social Democrats and some Social Democratic parties have already expressed support for the solution of these tasks in one form or another. It can be boldly said that many workers of capitalist countries, if they overcome the division within their ranks and unite all their forces, can deal a heavy blow to the policies of the ruling classes of capitalist countries, force them to stop preparing for a new war, can repel the attacks of monopoly capital, and can ensure that their urgent living and democratic demands are met.

In the struggle to improve the living conditions of the workers, to expand and defend their democratic rights, to struggle for and defend national independence, to struggle for peace among the peoples of various countries, and in the struggle to seize power and build socialism, the communist parties advocate cooperation with the Social Democratic Party. Communists have a strict and scientifically based great Marxist-Leninist doctrine, rich international experience in socialist construction. They are willing to engage in debate with the Social Democratic Party, convinced that this is the best way to compare views, thoughts, and accumulated experience, to eliminate deeply rooted prejudices, overcome the division of the workers, and establish cooperation.

The imperialist reactionaries are trying to arouse doubts about the communist movement and its ideology, continuing to frighten the masses, saying that communists need to use wars between countries to overthrow the capitalist system and establish the socialist system. The communists resolutely refute these slanders. The fact that the two world wars launched by the imperialists resulted in socialist revolutions does not mean that the path to socialist revolution necessarily goes through world wars, especially in our era when there is a powerful world socialist system. Marxist-Leninists have never believed that the path to socialist revolution goes through wars between countries.

The choice of one or another social system is the inalienable right of the people of each country. The socialist revolution cannot be imported and cannot be imposed from outside. It is the result of the internal development and the extreme sharpening of social contradictions in each country. Communists adhere to the Marxist-Leninist doctrine and have always opposed the export of revolution. At the same time, they resolutely oppose the imperialist export of counter-revolution. They consider their international duty to call on the peoples of various countries to unite, mobilize all their internal forces, take active action, and, relying on the power of the world socialist system, prevent and resolutely repel the interference of imperialists in the affairs of the peoples of any country who are rising in revolution.

Marxist-Leninist parties lead the working class and the laboring masses in the struggle to achieve the socialist revolution and establish some form of proletarian dictatorship. The forms and paths of the socialist revolution will depend on the specific balance of class forces in one or another country, the organizational strength and maturity of the working class and its vanguard, and the degree of resistance of the ruling class. Whatever form of proletarian dictatorship is established, this dictatorship will always mean the expansion of democracy, the transition from the formal democracy of the bourgeoisie to the true democracy of the laboring people.

The communist parties of various countries reaffirm the points of the 1957 Declaration regarding the problem of various forms of transition from capitalism to socialism.

The Declaration points out: The working class and its vanguard—the Marxist-Leninist party strive to achieve the socialist revolution by peaceful means. If this possibility can be realized, it will be beneficial for the working class and the entire people, for the entire nation.

Under the current conditions, in some capitalist countries, the working class, led by its advanced forces, can unite the majority of the people on the basis of the workers' front and the people's front, on the basis of various possible forms of agreements and various possible forms of political cooperation between different parties and social organizations, to take state power without civil war, thus ensuring that the basic means of production are transferred to the hands of the people. The working class, relying on the majority of the people, and resolutely striking down those opportunists who do not want to give up conciliation policies towards the capitalists and landlords, can defeat the reactionary, anti-people forces, gain a stable majority in the parliament, turn the parliament from a tool serving the class interests of the bourgeoisie into a tool serving the laboring people, while at the same time carrying out extensive mass struggles outside the parliament, smashing the resistance of the reactionary forces, and preparing the necessary conditions for the peaceful achievement of the socialist revolution. Only by constantly and extensively waging class struggles of the workers, peasants, and urban middle classes against big monopoly capital, against the reactionaries, for profound social reforms, for peace and socialism, can all this be achieved.

Under conditions where the exploiting class uses violence against the people, another possibility must be considered, that is, the non-peaceful transition to socialism. Leninism teaches us, and historical experience also proves, that the ruling class will not voluntarily relinquish power. Thus, the degree and forms of class struggle are determined more by the resistance of the reactionary groups to the will of the majority of the people, and by whether these groups use violence in this or that stage of the struggle for socialism.

In each country, which form of transition to socialism has real possibilities depends on specific historical conditions.

In our era, when communism is not only the most advanced doctrine but also an existing social system that has proven to be superior to capitalism, special favorable conditions are being created to expand the influence of the communist parties, to resolutely expose the bourgeois "anti-communism" used to oppose the proletariat and Marxist thought.

Anti-communism, as the main ideological weapon of the bourgeoisie in its struggle against the proletariat and Marxist thought, has existed since the early days of the workers' movement. With the sharpening of class struggle, especially with the formation of the world socialist system, anti-communism has become more vicious and insidious. Anti-communism reflects the deep ideological crisis and extreme degree of decay of the bourgeois thought system. It outrageously distorts the Marxist doctrine, brutally slanders the socialist social system, fabricates the policies and purposes of the communists, persecutes democratic and peace-loving forces and organizations.

The successful defense of the interests of the workers, the defense of the cause of peace, the realization of the socialist ideals of the working class, all this requires a resolute struggle against anti-communism—this vicious weapon used by the bourgeoisie to isolate the masses from socialism. It is necessary to strengthen the propaganda of socialist thought among the masses, to educate the workers with revolutionary spirit, to raise their class consciousness and revolutionary consciousness, and to reveal to all workers the superiority of the socialist society based on the experience of the countries of the world socialist system, to concretely point out to them the actual benefits that socialism brings to the workers, peasants, and other strata of residents of each country. The communists will free people from the fear of war, guarantee lasting peace; free them from imperialist oppression, exploitation, unemployment, and poverty, guarantee them a high standard of living; free them from the fear of economic crises, guarantee the flourishing of productive forces for the benefit of the whole society; free them from the oppression of money on personality, guarantee the comprehensive development of people's spirits, the full play of all talents, and the unlimited progress of society in science and culture. Except for a small group of exploiters, all strata of residents will benefit from the victory of the new social system. It is necessary to make the millions of masses in capitalist countries understand this.

The world communist movement has become the most influential political force of our time and the most important factor in social progress. In the fierce struggle against the imperialist reactionary forces for the interests of the working class and all laborers, for peace, national independence, democracy, and socialism, the communist movement is constantly advancing, uniting, and being tempered.

Currently, communist parties are active in 87 countries around the world. These parties have a total of more than 36 million members. This is a brilliant victory for Marxism-Leninism and a great achievement of the working class. In the countries that have freed themselves from colonial oppression and embarked on the path of independent development, Marxists with a common ideology are continuing to unite. The communist parties of various countries consider it their international duty to promote friendship and solidarity between the working class of their own countries and the labor movement of the countries that have gained independence in the common struggle against imperialism.

The growth of the ranks of the communist parties of various countries and their organizational consolidation, the victories achieved by some communist parties in the struggle against various tendencies, the overcoming of the harmful consequences of personality cult, the strengthening of the influence of the international communist movement—all this opens up new prospects for the successful solution of the tasks facing the communist parties of various countries.

Marxist-Leninist parties consider it their unshakable principle to strictly adhere to the Leninist principles of party life on the basis of democratic centralism, to protect the unity of the party as one protects one's eyes, to strictly adhere to the principles of party democracy and collective leadership, to value the role of the party leadership organs in party life according to the organizational principles of Leninism, and at the same time to be tireless in strengthening the ties of these leadership organs with the party members and the broad masses of laborers, not to allow the personal cult that restricts the creative thinking and initiative of the communists, to vigorously promote the initiative of the communists, and to carry out criticism and self-criticism within their ranks.

The communist parties of various countries have, in their thoughts, smashed the revisionists in their ranks who attempted to make the party deviate from the Marxist-Leninist path. In the struggle against revisionism and right-wing opportunism, each communist party and the entire international communist movement have been further consolidated in thought and organization.

The communist parties of various countries unanimously condemn the international opportunist variety of Yugoslavia—the concentrated expression of the "theory" of the modern revisionists. The leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia have betrayed Marxism-Leninism, declared that Marxism-Leninism is outdated, opposed the 1957 Declaration with their anti-Leninist revisionist platform, opposed the League of Communists of Yugoslavia to the entire international communist movement, made their country secede from the socialist camp, made it dependent on the so-called "aid" of American imperialists and other imperialists, and thus put the revolutionary achievements of the heroic struggle of the Yugoslav people in danger of being lost. The Yugoslav revisionists are engaged in the work of destroying the socialist camp and the world communist movement. Under the pretext of a non-aligned policy, they are engaged in activities harmful to all peace-loving forces and national unity. It remains a necessary task for the Marxist-Leninist parties of various countries to further expose the leaders of Yugoslav revisionism and actively struggle to prevent the communist movement and the workers' movement from being influenced by the anti-Leninist thoughts of the Yugoslav revisionists.

The practice of the struggle of the working class, the entire process of social development, once again brilliantly proves the great invincible power and vitality of Marxism-Leninism, and powerfully refutes all the "theories" of the modern revisionists.

As the 1957 Moscow Declaration pointed out, the further development of the communist movement and the workers' movement requires continuing to wage a resolute struggle on two fronts in the future—against revisionism, which remains the main danger, and also against dogmatism and sectarianism.

Revisionism, right-wing opportunism, distorts Marxism-Leninism, emasculates the revolutionary soul of Marxism-Leninism, reflects bourgeois thought in theory and practice, numbs the revolutionary will of the working class, disarms the workers and the laboring masses in the struggle against the oppression of the imperialists and exploiters, in the struggle for peace, democracy, and national liberation, in the struggle for the victory of socialism.

If a persistent struggle is not waged against dogmatism and sectarianism, they may also become the main danger for some parties in this or that stage of development. They make it impossible for revolutionary parties to develop Marxism-Leninism on the basis of scientific analysis, to creatively apply Marxism-Leninism according to specific conditions. They make communists alienated from the broad masses of the laboring classes, make communists passive in the revolutionary struggle or take leftist adventurist actions, make them unable to timely and correctly estimate the changing situation and new experiences, make them unable to use all possible means to achieve the victory of the working class and all democratic forces in the struggle against imperialism, against the reactionaries and the danger of war, and thus hinder the peoples of various countries from achieving victory in their just struggles.

Under the conditions of the imperialist reactionaries uniting their forces to oppose communism, it is especially necessary to exert all efforts to unite the world communist movement. Unity and solidarity make the power of our movement increase many times over and provide a reliable guarantee for the advancement of the great communist cause and for achieving success in repelling the attacks of the enemy.

The great Marxist-Leninist doctrine and the common struggle to realize this doctrine unite all communists in the world. The interests of the communist movement require that each communist party, in the spirit of unity, adhere to the common tasks and conclusions determined by the brother parties at the conference regarding the struggle against imperialism, for peace, democracy, and socialism.

The interests of the struggle for the cause of the working class require the increasing consolidation of the ranks of each communist party, the consolidation of the great ranks of communists of all countries, and require their unity of will and unity of action. Caring for the constant strengthening of the unity of the international communist movement is the highest international duty of each Marxist-Leninist party.

The resolute defense of the unity of the international communist movement on the basis of the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism is a necessary condition for achieving victory in the struggle for national independence, democracy, and peace, and for the smooth solution of the tasks of the socialist revolution, socialist, and communist construction. Going against these principles will lead to the weakening of communist forces.

All Marxist-Leninist parties are independent and equal, and they formulate their policies based on the specific conditions of their own countries, adhering to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and mutually supporting each other. The success of the cause of the working class in each country requires the internationalist sympathy and support of all Marxist-Leninist parties. Each party is responsible to the working class and the laboring people of its own country and is responsible to the entire international workers' movement and the communist movement.

The communist and workers' parties hold conferences as needed to discuss urgent issues, exchange experiences, understand each other's views and positions, and reach a consensus through consultation, coordinating joint actions in the struggle for common goals.

When a certain party has issues related to the activities of another brother party, the leadership of that party will bring it to the attention of the leadership of the relevant party, and will have talks and consultations if necessary.

The experience and results of the conferences of the representatives of the communist parties held in recent years, especially the two largest conferences—the November 1957 conference and this conference, show that under the current conditions, such conferences are an effective form of exchanging views and experiences, enriching Marxist-Leninist theory through collective efforts, and determining a unified position in the struggle for common goals.

The communist and workers' parties unanimously declare: The Communist Party of the Soviet Union—the most experienced and battle-tested force in the international communist movement, has been and will continue to be the recognized vanguard of the world communist movement. The experience accumulated by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the struggle for the victory of the working class, in socialist construction, and in the realization of comprehensive communist construction has a principled significance for the entire international communist movement. The example of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its fraternal sympathy inspire all communist parties to struggle for peace and socialism, and is a manifestation of the practical application of the principles of proletarian internationalist revolution. The historic resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union not only have great significance for the communist construction of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union but also open up a new stage in the international communist movement, promoting its further development on the basis of Marxism-Leninism.

The communist and workers' parties of various countries are all making their own contributions to the development of the great Marxist-Leninist doctrine. In the relations between all Marxist-Leninist brother parties, mutual assistance and support are the practical application of the principles of proletarian internationalist revolution.

Under the current conditions, ideological issues have special significance. The exploiting classes use increasingly intensified methods of ideological corruption of the masses to counter the achievements of socialism, striving to keep the masses as spiritual prisoners of bourgeois thought. Communists consider it their task to wage a resolute offensive on the ideological front, striving to free the people from various forms of spiritual slavery of bourgeois thought, including the harmful influence of reformism, striving to spread advanced thought that guarantees social progress among the masses, spreading the thought of freedom-loving democracy and scientific socialism.

Historical experience shows that even after the establishment of the socialist system, capitalist remnants will still exist in people's consciousness for a long period. This makes it necessary for the party to carry out extensive work to educate the masses in communism, to strengthen the Marxist-Leninist education and tempering of the party and state cadres.

Marxism-Leninism is a unified great revolutionary doctrine, a great guiding star for all stages of the struggle of the working class and the laboring people of the world for peace, freedom, and a beautiful life, for the establishment of the most rational society—communism. Its great creative transformative power lies in the fact that it is inseparable from life and is constantly enriched on the basis of a comprehensive analysis of reality. On the basis of Marxism-Leninism, the family of socialist countries, the international communist movement, the international workers' movement, and the liberation movement have achieved great historical victories, and only on this basis can all the tasks facing the communist and workers' parties of various countries be successfully solved.

The participants of the conference believe that the further consolidation of the communist parties of various countries on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism is the most important condition for uniting the forces of the working class, uniting the democratic and progressive forces, and is a guarantee for the new victories of the world communist movement and the workers' movement in their great struggle for the bright future of all mankind, for the victory of the cause of peace and socialism.

    各国共产党和工人党代表会议声明
    各国共产党和工人党代表，在这次会议上，讨论了当前国际局势和今后争取和平、民族独立、民主和社会主义的斗争的迫切问题。
    会议表明，会议参加者对所讨论的问题的观点是一致的。各国共产党和工人党一致肯定它们忠于一九五七年通过的宣言和和平宣言。这两个创造性的马克思列宁主义的纲领性文件，确定了国际共产主义运动对当代最重要问题的原则立场，大大促进了各国共产党和工人党把力量联合在一起，为共同目标进行斗争。这两个文件，仍然是整个国际共产主义运动的战斗旗帜和行动指南。
    三年来事件的进程，证实了这两个文件对国际局势和世界发展前景所作的分析的正确性，证实了创造性的马克思列宁主义的伟大的科学力量和积极作用。
  这几年的主要总结是：世界社会主义体系的威力和它的国际影响的急剧增长；殖民主义体系在民族解放运动的打击下迅速瓦解；资本主义世界中的阶级搏斗日益加剧；世界资本主义体系更加衰落和腐朽。在世界舞台上，社会主义力量日益明显地超过帝国主义，和平力量日益明显地超过战争力量。
    但是，帝国主义企图保持自己的阵地，阻挠裁军，力图延长和全力加剧“冷战”，顽固地准备着新的世界战争。因此，实际生活迫切地要求社会主义国家、国际工人阶级、反帝民族运动、所有爱好和平的国家和一切和平战士日益紧密地把力量联合在一起，采取坚决的行动，以防止战争和保障人们的和平生活。实际生活迫切地要求一切革命力量进一步团结起来，进行反对帝国主义、争取民族独立和社会主义的斗争。
    一
    以伟大的十月社会主义革命所开始的从资本主义向社会主义的过渡为主要内容的我们的时代，是两个对立的社会体系斗争的时代，是社会主义革命和民族解放革命的时代，是帝国主义崩溃、殖民主义体系消灭的时代，是越来越多的人民走上社会主义道路、社会主义和共产主义在全世界范围内胜利的时代。
    我们时代的主要特征，是世界社会主义体系正在成为人类社会发展的决定性因素。
    近几十年来新旧两个世界间的巨大搏斗，证明社会主义是强有力的，是不可战胜的。帝国主义及其急先锋——法西斯主义，想用战争来阻挠历史发展进程的企图遭到了破产。帝国主义已经没有力量堵住欧亚两洲社会主义革命的道路了。社会主义已经成为世界体系。帝国主义企图阻止社会主义国家的经济发展，这些阴谋被粉碎了。帝国主义用尽一切办法想保持住殖民主义奴役制度，但是这个制度正在崩溃。随着世界社会主义体系的巩固，国际局势越来越肯定地发生着有利于争取独立、民主和社会进步的人民的变化。
    在现时代，决定人类社会历史发展的主要内容、主要方向和主要特点的，是世界社会主义体系，是反对帝国主义、争取对社会进行社会主义改造的力量。帝国主义的任何挣扎都不能阻止历史向前发展。社会主义取得进一步决定性胜利的巩固前提，已经奠定了。社会主义的完全胜利是必不可免的。
    社会发展的进程证实着列宁的预见：社会主义胜利了的国家，通过经济建设给世界革命的发展以主要影响。社会主义在生产、科学和技术领域里，在建立人们新的、自由的、能日益更多地保证物质需要和精神需要的友爱大家庭方面，都取得了空前未有的创造性成就。社会主义在世界生产中的比重方面，也占首位的时候已经不远了。资本主义将在人类活动的决定性领域里，即在物质生产领域里遭到失败。
    社会主义体系的巩固和发展给资本主义各国人民的斗争以日益增长的影响。世界社会主义体系以其示范的力量，使资本主义世界劳动者的思想革命化，鼓舞他们去进行反对资本主义的斗争，并且在很大程度上改善着这一斗争的条件。在各资本主义国家中，保卫和平和民族独立、保证民主胜利和社会主义胜利的内部力量，正在增长和加强。
    世界资本主义体系处在一个深刻的衰落和瓦解的过程中。帝国主义的矛盾加速了垄断资本主义向国家垄断资本主义的转变。国家垄断资本主义加强垄断组织对国家生活的统治，把垄断组织的力量和国家的力量合为一体，以便挽救资本主义制度，通过剥削工人阶级和掠夺广大居民阶层来最大限度地增加帝国主义资产阶级的利润。
    但是，垄断资产阶级没有任何办法能够挽救资本主义。一小撮垄断组织的利益同全民的利益有不可调和的矛盾。资本主义社会的阶级对抗和民族对抗，内部矛盾和外部矛盾，都急剧地尖锐化了。用军国主义来支撑资本主义的腐朽基础的企图，使这些矛盾更加紧张起来。
    在资本主义世界，生产力和生产关系的冲突，还从来没有这样深刻过。资本主义越来越阻碍着利用现代科学技术的成就来为社会进步的利益服务。资本主义用人类天才的发现来反对人类本身，把这些发现变成毁灭性战争的残酷手段。
    资本主义经济的不稳定性在增长着。尽管某些资本主义国家的生产在或多或少的程度上有一定的增长，但是，资本主义的矛盾无论在本国或国际范围内，都在不断地尖锐化。一系列资本主义国家还没有来得及克服不久以前经济危机的全部后果，现在又面临着新的经济震荡的威胁。资本主义生产的无政府性质日益加深。资本主义的集中过程空前加剧，垄断组织的利润和超额利润在增长。垄断资本通过各种新形式，首先是通过加强劳动强度，无比地加重了对工人阶级的剥削。在资本主义条件下，生产自动化和“合理化”给劳动者带来新的灾难。在个别国家中，工人阶级只是依靠顽强的斗争才使自己的一些切身要求得到满足；而在许多资本主义国家里，生活水平仍然低于战前的水平。与资产阶级的诺言相反，只是在个别的资本主义国家里，而且只是暂时地实现了充分就业。垄断组织的横暴给广大农民群众和中小资产阶级广大阶层的利益带来日益严重的损害。在资本主义国家里，包括某些最发达的资本主义国家，仍然存在着经济不发达的、群众生活特别贫困的地区，这样的地区甚至还在扩大。
    所有这一切，再一次驳斥了资产阶级思想家和修正主义者的谎言，即现代资本主义似乎已经变成“人民资本主义”，似乎建立了能够克服生产的无政府状态和经济危机、能够保障全体劳动者福利的所谓“福利国家”。
    资本主义发展的不平衡性，不断地改变着帝国主义国家之间的力量对比。帝国主义的统治范围越缩小，帝国主义列强间的矛盾就表现得越厉害。市场问题空前地尖锐化了。在“整体化”口号下产生的新的国际组织，实际上在加深着帝国主义国家间的矛盾和斗争。这种组织是最大的资本家集团之间瓜分资本主义世界市场的新形式，是较强的帝国主义国家向其软弱的伙伴实行经济渗透的新形式。
    在现代帝国主义的主要国家——美国，资本主义的腐朽表现得最明显。美国垄断资本暴露出它显然没有能力利用现有的生产力。发达的资本主义国家中最富有的国家——美国，成了经常失业现象特别严重的国家。工业开工日益不足，成了那里的经常现象。在战后年代里，尽管靠降低劳动人民的生活水平大大增加军事拨款，但是生产的增长速度正在下降，勉强超过人口的增长。生产过剩的危机更加频繁了。这个工业最发达的资本主义国家成了一个最畸形的军事化经济的国家。美国比所有其他资本主义国家都更厉害地榨取亚洲各国特别是拉丁美洲各国的财富，阻碍这些国家的发展。美国资本正加紧渗入非洲。美国帝国主义成了最大的国际剥削者。
    美国帝国主义利用军事集团的和经济“援助”的政策作为主要手段，力图使许多国家屈服于它的统治。它也破坏着发达的资本主义国家的主权。高度发达的资本主义国家中占统治地位的垄断资产阶级，同美国帝国主义结成联盟，牺牲本国的主权，指望依靠美国帝国主义者的支持，镇压革命的解放力量，剥夺劳动人民的民主自由，阻挠人民群众争取社会进步的斗争。美国帝国主义把这些国家拖入军备竞赛，拖着他们执行准备新的侵略战争和对社会主义国家以及中立国家进行颠复活动的政策。
    资本主义制度的基础腐烂到了这样的程度，以致在许多国家中执政的帝国主义资产阶级，再也无力单独对付日益增长和团结起来的民主和进步力量。帝国主义者结成以美国为首的各种军事政治联盟，共同进行反对社会主义阵营的斗争，扼杀民族解放运动、工人运动和社会主义运动。近年来国际事件的进程，提供了许多新的证据，证明美国帝国主义是世界反动势力的主要堡垒，是国际宪兵，是全世界人民的敌人。
    美国所建立起来的军事集团体系，正被这些集团的成员之间的斗争以及群众为取消这些集团的斗争所削弱。美国帝国主义者竭力加强侵略集团，这就引起群众的更大反抗。尽管美国在资本主义世界经济中的比重正在下降，它仍然是现代帝国主义主要的经济、财政和军事力量。英法帝国主义者为保持自己的阵地进行着顽强的斗争。已经恢复起自己力量的、同美国垄断组织有密切联系的西德和日本垄断组织，正在加紧向外扩张。西德垄断组织执行帝国主义政策，越来越积极地致力于剥削不发达的国家。
    各国人民日益坚决地起来进行反对帝国主义的斗争。劳动力量和资本力量之间，民主力量和反动力量之间，自由力量和殖民主义力量之间，正在展开一场大规模的会战。古巴的深刻的人民革命的胜利，已经成为拉丁美洲各国人民的良好榜样。在非洲以不可抗拒之势展开了争取自由和民族独立的反殖民主义运动。伊拉克的反帝民族起义获得了成功。在日本展开了反对日美军事同盟、争取和平、民主和民族独立的强大的人民群众运动。意大利的人民群众保卫民主的积极行动证明了劳动者的战斗决心。在法国，争取民主、反对个人专权的反动制度的斗争正在加强。美国、阿根廷、乌拉圭、智利、印度、英国、加拿大、比利时以及其他资本主义国家的工人展开了大规模的罢工。美国黑人争取自身生活权利的行动正在成为群众性的行动。在西班牙和葡萄牙，反对法西斯独裁的全民力量联合起来的趋向正在增长，希腊的民主运动正在加强。哥伦比亚和委内瑞拉的军事暴虐制度已被推翻，南朝鲜和土耳其露骨的亲美傀儡政府受到打击。南越和老挝反对美国帝国主义者及其走狗的民族民主运动正在发展。印度尼西亚人民正在铲除遗留在他们国内的帝国主义者的经济阵地，特别是荷兰殖民主义者的阵地。保卫和平的群众运动正在扩大，遍及所有大陆。这一切明显地证明，反帝斗争、民族解放斗争、反战斗争和阶级斗争的浪潮正在日益高涨。
    社会主义在占人类三分之一的欧亚许多国家的胜利；全世界为争取社会主义而斗争的力量的蓬勃增长；帝国主义在同社会主义进行经济竞赛中阵地的不断削弱；民族解放斗争的新的巨大高涨和殖民主义体系的迅速瓦解；整个资本主义世界经济体系的不稳定性的增长；由于国家垄断资本主义的发展和军国主义的加强而引起的资本主义矛盾的尖锐化；垄断组织和全民利益之间的矛盾的加深；资产阶级民主的缩小，采取专制和法西斯统治方法的趋势；资产阶级的政治和思想的深刻危机——这一切都证明资本主义总危机已经发展到了一个新的阶段。这个阶段的特点在于：它不是与世界大战相联系而产生的，而是在两个体系的竞赛和斗争、力量对比越来越有利于社会主义以及帝国主义的一切矛盾急剧尖锐化的情况下，在爱好和平力量为实现和巩固和平共处的胜利斗争使帝国主义者未能以其侵略行动破坏普遍和平的条件下，在广大人民群众争取民主、民族解放和社会主义的斗争高涨的情况下产生的。
    所有革命力量都在联合起来反对帝国主义的压迫和剥削。正在建设社会主义和共产主义的人民，资本主义国家工人阶级的革命运动，被压迫人民的民族解放斗争，一般民主运动——所有这些当代的伟大力量，正在汇合成为一股冲击和摧毁世界帝国主义体系的洪流。站在现时代的中心的是国际工人阶级和它的主要产物——世界社会主义体系。它们是争取和平、民主、民族解放、社会主义和人类进步的斗争取得胜利的保证。
    二　　
    世界社会主义体系已经进入了新的发展阶段。苏联正在胜利地全面建设共产主义社会。社会主义阵营的其他国家正在胜利地奠定社会主义基础，其中某些国家已经进入发达的社会主义社会的建设时期。
    社会主义在它的整个体系的范围内，取得了决定性的胜利。这些胜利标志着马克思列宁主义的胜利，这些胜利向受资本压迫的各国人民明显地说明：在马克思列宁主义学说的基础上建立起来的社会，为经济和文化的繁荣，为保证人们的高度生活水平和和平幸福生活，开辟无限的可能。
    苏联人民胜利地执行着发展国民经济的七年计划，迅速地建设着共产主义的物质技术基础。苏联科学在世界文明的发展中开辟了一个新时代，奠定了征服宇宙的开端，从而鲜明地显示了社会主义阵营的经济和技术的力量。苏联第一个在历史上为全人类铺设着通向共产主义的道路。苏联是全世界人民争取和平、民主自由、民族独立和社会进步的斗争中的最光辉的榜样和最强大的堡垒。
  中国的人民革命给帝国主义在亚洲的阵地以毁灭性的打击，在很大程度上促进了世界力量对比发生有利于社会主义的变化。它给民族解放运动以新的有力的推动，给各国人民，特别是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的人民以巨大的影响。
    同伟大的苏联一起构成强大的社会主义阵营的各人民民主共和国，即阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、德意志民主共和国、越南民主共和国、中国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、蒙古、波兰、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克社会主义共和国，在短短的历史时期内，获得了社会主义建设的巨大成就。
    这些国家的人民政权证明了自己的不可动摇的巩固性。社会主义生产关系在国民经济中起着统治作用；人剥削人的现象已经永远消灭或者正在顺利地消灭着。由于胜利地执行社会主义工业化政策，社会主义国家的经济繁荣起来了，它们的经济发展速度大大超过了资本主义国家。所有这些国家都建立了发达的工业；过去的农业国家已经变成或者正在变成工农业国家。
    近年来，所有的人民民主国家都已经解决或者正在成功地解决社会主义建设中最困难的问题，即农民自愿地从小私有经济的道路走上大规模社会主义合作化经济的道路。列宁的合作化计划，无论对于那些长时期中农民土地私有观念很深的国家来说，或者对于那些不久以前消灭了封建关系的国家来说，都显示了它的伟大的生命力。工人阶级领导下的工农兄弟联盟巩固起来了，正如弗·伊·列宁所教导的，这个联盟的保持和巩固是无产阶级专政的最高原则。在社会主义建设过程中，作为社会主义制度的政治基础的两个劳动阶级的这一联盟不断地发展，它促进工人阶级领导下的人民政权的进一步巩固，促进农业在农民自愿合作化的列宁主义原则基础上的社会主义改造。
    社会结构发生了有历史意义的变化。在各人民民主国家里，地主阶级和资产阶级已不复存在。工人阶级成了社会的主要力量，它的队伍在成长着，它的觉悟程度和政治成熟程度提高了。社会主义使农民摆脱了世世代代的贫困，使他们变成了社会进步的积极力量。同劳动人民血肉相连的新型的社会主义知识分子正在形成。全体公民都能够自由地获得知识和文化。这样，社会主义就为社会的文化发展，为人的天赋和才能的全面和充分的发展，不仅创造了政治条件，而且创造了物质条件。人民群众的物质生活水平，在经济胜利发展的基础上不断地提高。
    在多民族的社会主义国家里，各族劳动人民之间的牢不可破的联盟已经形成和巩固了。马克思列宁主义的民族政策在社会主义国家的胜利，各民族的真正平等以及他们的经济和文化的高涨，对于为反对民族压迫而斗争的人民来说，是鼓舞人心的榜样。
    在人民民主国家里，社会主义思想在同资产阶级思想的斗争中取得了显著的成绩。这个斗争具有长期性，并且将一直继续到使人们的意识完全摆脱资产阶级思想残余为止。
    社会在政治道义上的一致，是历史上首先在苏联产生和巩固了的，现在在其他社会主义国家中也加强起来了。这样，就为最有效地利用自由的劳动者的创造力，去促进生产力的发展和社会主义社会的繁荣，创造了可能。
    社会主义社会在不断完善，日益成熟。在这个社会中，不断产生着共产主义的劳动态度和未来共产主义社会的其他因素。社会主义经济的领导方法和经济计划的方法日益完善。社会主义民主正在进一步地发展，人民群众更广泛地参与经济建设和文化建设的领导，国家的个别职能逐渐转入社会组织手中。
    现在不仅在苏联，而且在其他社会主义国家，也消灭了资本主义在社会经济方面复辟的可能性。社会主义阵营的联合力量，可靠地保障着每个社会主义国家不受帝国主义反动势力的侵犯。这样，社会主义各国结成为一个统一的阵营，这个阵营的日益加强的团结和不断增长的威力，保证社会主义在它的整个体系的范围内取得完全胜利。
    在过去的年代里，工人阶级和农民的英勇劳动，共产党和工人党的巨大工作，为生产力的进一步蓬勃发展，为社会主义各国在同资本主义和平经济竞赛中最大限度地赢得时间并取得胜利，创造了极为有利的客观可能性。领导社会主义国家的马克思列宁主义政党认为，善于正确地利用这些可能性是自己的责任。
    获得了巨大胜利和经历了严重考验的各国共产党，在领导社会主义建设方面积累了丰富的多方面的经验。社会主义各国和整个社会主义阵营所以获得成就，是由于根据每个国家的历史特点和整个社会主义体系的利益正确地运用了社会主义建设的共同规律，是由于这些国家人民的努力，由于它们密切的兄弟般的合作和国际主义的相互援助，首先是由于苏联的兄弟般的国际主义的援助。
    社会主义各国发展的经验再一次表明，它们获得成就和成绩的最重要的国际条件是：相互援助和相互支持，利用社会主义阵营各国团结一致的一切优越性。帝国主义者、叛徒和修正主义者指望社会主义阵营可能分裂，这种打算是建筑在沙子上的，是注定要破产的。所有社会主义国家像保护眼珠一样，保护社会主义阵营的团结。
    世界社会主义经济体系，是依靠社会主义生产关系的共同性结成的，是在社会主义经济规律的基础上发展的。为了使这个体系胜利地发展，就要求：在社会主义建设中，一贯运用有计划按比例发展的规律；发挥人民群众的创造性的主动精神；在自愿、互利和全力提高科学技术水平的基础上，通过实行世界社会主义体系范围内的国民经济计划的配合，以及生产专业化和协作来经常改进国际分工制度；研究集体经验；加强合作和兄弟般的相互援助；在这个基础上，逐步克服历史上形成的各国经济发展水平的差别，并且建立物质基础，使社会主义体系的各国人民大致同时过渡到共产主义。
    在各国社会主义建设实践的基础上，已经积累了整个社会主义阵营的集体经验。兄弟党全面研究这一经验，并且根据具体条件和民族特点创造性地运用和丰富它，是每个社会主义国家发展的确定不移的规律。
    社会主义各国共产党和工人党认为自己的国际义务是：根据现有可能高速度地发展每个国家的工农业生产，充分利用社会主义体系的一切优越性和每个国家的国内资源，以便通过共同努力在最短期间解决一项历史任务，即在工农业生产绝对产量方面超过世界资本主义体系，进而在按人口平均计算的生产水平和生活水平方面超过经济上最发达的资本主义国家。为了解决这项任务，必须不断改善政治工作和经济工作，必须经常改进国民经济的领导方法，必须有以科学为依据的社会主义的经营方法，即在技术不断进步的基础上大力提高劳动生产率，有计划地管理经济，始终不渝地遵守列宁的物质利益原则和通过提高群众政治觉悟大力发展对有益于社会的劳动实行精神鼓励的原则，对劳动量和消费量实行监督。
    社会主义各国向共产主义过渡的必要物质基础是：在最新的先进技术、国民经济电气化、生产机械化和自动化的基础上，创造高度的生产水平。没有这一切，就不能保证共产主义社会所必需的丰富的消费品。在这个基础上，必须发展共产主义的社会关系，全力提高人民群众的政治觉悟，培养共产主义新社会的人。
    社会主义阵营是由紧密的社会主义国际团结以及共同利益和目的的一致所联合起来的、沿着社会主义和共产主义道路前进的、自由而享有主权的各国人民在社会、经济和政治方面的结合。严格遵守马克思列宁主义原则和社会主义国际主义原则，是社会主义国家相互关系的不可破坏的准则。在社会主义阵营中，参加这一阵营的每一个国家，都享有真正平等和独立自主。社会主义各国根据完全平等、互利和同志式相互援助的原则，使全面的经济、政治和文化的合作日益完善，这既符合每一个社会主义国家的利益，又符合整个社会主义阵营的利益。
    世界社会主义体系的最伟大的成就之一，是它在实践中证明了马克思列宁主义关于民族对抗随着阶级对抗的消失而消失的原理。阶级和阶级、民族和民族、国家和国家之间的对抗性的、导致军事冲突的矛盾是资本主义制度所固有的。同资本主义制度的规律相反，社会主义体系在本质上没有能使这个体系的人民间或国家间发生矛盾和冲突的客观原因。这个体系的发展，使各国和各民族越来越团结，使它们之间合作的各种形式越来越巩固。社会主义把本国的经济、文化、国家体制的发展，同整个世界社会主义体系的巩固和发展的利益，同各民族的日益团结，有机地结合在一起。整个社会主义体系的利益和各国的民族利益，是和谐地结合在一起的。社会主义大家庭的各国人民在政治道义上的一致，就是在这个基础上产生的，并且在这个基础上不断地巩固。社会主义制度所产生的各国人民之间的兄弟友谊和相互援助，代替了资本主义所固有的政治上的割裂和民族利己主义。
    社会主义各国人民的共同利益，社会主义和和平事业的利益，要求在政策上把社会主义国际主义的原则同社会主义爱国主义的原则正确地结合起来。每一个执政的共产党，无论对自己国家的命运，或者对整个社会主义阵营的命运，都负有历史性的责任。
    一九五七年宣言完全正确地指出，夸大民族特点的作用，脱离马克思列宁主义关于社会主义革命和社会主义建设的普遍真理，会使社会主义的共同事业遭受损失。同时，宣言也完全正确地指出，马克思列宁主义要求根据每个国家的具体历史条件创造性地运用社会主义革命和社会主义建设的共同原则，不允许机械地抄袭他国共产党的政策和策略。一个无产阶级政党如果忽视了民族特点，就会脱离生活，脱离群众，就会使社会主义事业遭受损失。
    民族主义和民族局限性的表现，不会随着社会主义制度的建立就自动消失。为了巩固社会主义各国之间的兄弟关系和友谊，各国共产党和工人党必须执行马克思列宁主义的国际主义的政策，以国际主义和爱国主义相结合的精神教育全体劳动者，为克服资产阶级民族主义和沙文主义的残余进行坚决的斗争。
    各国共产党和工人党，不倦地以社会主义国际主义的精神、以对民族主义和沙文主义的一切表现决不调和的精神教育劳动者。社会主义各国共产党和工人党以及人民的团结一致，他们对马克思列宁主义学说的忠诚，这是每一个社会主义国家和整个社会主义阵营强大有力和不可战胜的主要源泉。
    社会主义各国的人民正在铺设通向共产主义的道路，为全人类创造新社会的雏形。资本主义世界的劳动者极其关心地注视着社会主义和共产主义建设者的创造性活动。这使社会主义各国马克思列宁主义政党和人民在国际工人运动面前担负起胜利地建设社会主义和共产主义的责任。
    各国共产党和工人党，把不倦地巩固各国人民的社会主义大家庭看成是自己的任务，这个大家庭的国际作用和对世界事件进程的影响一年比一年地增长着。
    社会主义各国组成了世界体系，成为对世界发展有强大影响的国际力量的时刻已经到来。用有利于和平、民主和社会主义的新的方式解决当代最重要问题的现实可能性，已经出现了。
    三
    　　　
    我们时代最迫切的问题是战争与和平的问题。
    战争是资本主义的经常伴侣。人剥削人的制度和人屠杀人的制度，是资本主义制度的两个方面。帝国主义已经使人类遭受两次世界战争的浩劫，现在又使人类受到陷入更可怕的灾难的威胁。骇人听闻的大规模杀伤和破坏武器已经造成。在新战争中使用这种武器，会使整个整个的国家受到空前未有的破坏，把世界生产和世界文化的巨大中心变成废墟。这样的战争会给亿万人，其中也包括没有参加战争的国家的人们带来死亡和苦难。帝国主义给全人类带来严重的危险。
    现在比任何时候都更要求各国人民保持特别高的警惕。只要帝国主义还存在，就有侵略战争的土壤。
    各国人民都清楚，新的世界大战的危险还没有过去。侵略和战争的主要力量是美国帝国主义。它的政策体现着好战的反动派的思想。在英、法和西德的帝国主义者的参与下，在防御“共产主义威胁”的幌子下，美国帝国主义把许多国家拉入北大西洋公约组织、中央条约组织、东南亚条约组织和其他军事集团，在整个所谓“自由世界”，即从属于它的资本主义国家，布满了它的首先是针对社会主义国家的军事基地网。这些集团和基地的存在，威胁着普遍和平和安全，不仅侵犯那些把自己的领土供给美国黩武主义者作基地的国家的主权，而且也威胁着那些国家的生存。
    美国、英国和法国的帝国主义势力和西德帝国主义进行着罪恶的勾结。在西德，军国主义已经复活，由希特勒的将军们指挥的庞大正规军正在加紧重建。美国帝国主义者正以火箭核武器和其他最新式的大规模杀伤武器武装这支军队。这引起了各国爱好和平人民的日益增强的坚决反抗。在法国和其他西欧国家内，正为这支侵略军队提供军事基地。来自西德帝国主义的对欧洲各国人民的和平和安全事业的威胁正在加剧。西德的复仇主义者公开宣称，他们打算重新修改第二次世界大战后已经确定的边界。正如当年的希特勒匪帮一样，西德军国主义者正在准备反对社会主义国家和欧洲其他国家的战争，力图实现他们的侵略计划。西柏林变成了国际挑衅的策源地。波恩国家已经成为欧洲的和平共处、裁军和缓和紧张局势的主要敌人。
    欧洲所有爱好和平的国家和人民，必须用联合的力量来对付西德帝国主义的侵略计划。在反对西德军国主义的侵略野心的斗争中，德意志民主共和国起着特别重大的作用。会议参加者认为，保卫社会主义在西欧的前哨、德国人民爱好和平的愿望的真正体现者——德意志民主共和国不受侵犯，是社会主义阵营所有国家和一切爱好和平人民的义务。
    美国帝国主义者在远东也正在积极地复活战争策源地。他们侵犯日本人民的民族独立，违背日本人民的意志，勾结日本反动统治集团，把新的军事条约强加于日本。这一条约以对苏联、中华人民共和国和其他爱好和平国家进行侵略为目的。美国强盗霸占了属于中华人民共和国的台湾，霸占了南朝鲜，越来越多地干涉南越的事务，并把它们变成了危险的军事挑衅和军事冒险的策源地。美国帝国主义者对古巴进行侵略威胁，干涉拉丁美洲、非洲和近东各国人民的内政，力图在世界各地建立新的战争策源地。美国帝国主义者利用像美洲国家组织这种区域性同盟，保持他们对拉丁美洲国家在经济上和政治上的控制，并且裹胁这些国家来实现他们的侵略阴谋。
    美国帝国主义建立了巨大的战争机构，不愿意缩减这些机构。帝国主义者破坏苏联和其他爱好和平国家旨在裁军的任何建设性的建议。军备竞赛在继续着。核武器储备惊人地增长着。法国统治集团不顾本国和其他各国、特别是非洲大陆各国人民的抗议，走上了制造和试验原子武器的道路。美国黩武主义者正在准备恢复有害的原子试验。蕴藏着严重国际冲突危险的军事挑衅正在继续。
    美国统治集团用挑衅和侵略行动的政策破坏了巴黎的政府首脑会议，采取了加剧国际紧张局势和使
  “冷战”尖锐化的方针。战争威胁加剧了。帝国主义对和平的挑衅，引起了各国人民的愤怒和反抗；美国帝国主义更加暴露了自己的面目，它在世界上的影响受到了新的严重打击。
    帝国主义的侵略本性没有改变。但是，已经形成了能够粉碎它的侵略计划的现实力量。战争的注定不可避免性是不存在的。如果按照帝国主义者的意志，那么他们早就把人类推入新的世界战争的灾难和恐怖的深渊了。然而帝国主义者能够为所欲为地决定战争是否发生的时代已经过去了。近年来，帝国主义者不止一次地发动局部战争，使人类处于世界灾难的边缘。苏联、其他社会主义国家和一切爱好和平力量的坚决立场，制止了英、法、以色列对埃及的干涉，阻止了帝国主义者对叙利亚、伊拉克和其他一些国家的军事侵犯。英雄的阿尔及利亚人民正在继续英勇地为争取独立和自由而斗争。刚果和老挝的人民正在给帝国主义者的罪恶行动以越来越坚决的反击。经验证明，可以有效地反对帝国主义者所发动的局部战争，胜利地消除这种战争的策源地。
    能够制止帝国主义侵略者实现他们的世界战争计划的时候已经到来。世界社会主义阵营、国际工人阶级、民族解放运动、所有反对战争的国家以及一切爱好和平力量的联合努力能够防止世界战争。
    我们时代的国际关系的发展，决定于两个社会体系的斗争，决定于社会主义、和平和民主的力量反对帝国主义、反动派和侵略的力量的斗争，在这个斗争中社会主义、和平和民主的力量越来越明显地占优势。
    历史上第一次有了伟大的有组织的力量在进行着反对战争的斗争，这些力量是：在决定性的科学技术部门占据世界领先地位的强大的苏联；用自己的强大物质力量和政治力量服务于和平事业的整个社会主义阵营；迫切关心维护和平的日益增多的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的爱好和平的国家；国际工人阶级和它的各种组织，首先是共产党：殖民地和附属国人民的民族解放运动；争取和平的世界运动；不同意帝国主义发动战争的方针和主张和平共处的中立国家。发达的资本主义国家中清醒地估计力量对比和现代战争惨重后果的一部分资产阶级，也表示赞成和平共处政策。为了维护世界和平，必须建立保卫和平、反对美国帝国主义所鼓吹的帝国主义侵略和战争政策的最广泛的统一战线。一切爱好和平力量的联合和积极的行动，能够维护住和平，防止新战争。
    现在，对于所有民主和爱好和平的力量来说，再没有比使人类免遭世界热核灾难更迫切的任务了。现代军事技术的空前破坏性，迫切地要求把所有反对战争、爱好和平的力量的主要行动集中于防止战争。不能把反对战争的斗争拖延到战争爆发的时候，因为那时对于世界许多地区和那里的居民来说，进行斗争将会是太迟了。不要等到落原子弹和氢弹的时候，才展开反对新的世界战争危险的斗争。现在就应当进行这一斗争，并且要一天比一天更加努力。主要的是及时制服侵略者，防止战争，不使它爆发。
    今天，为和平而斗争，就是保持最大的警惕性，不倦地揭露帝国主义的政策，警觉地注视战争挑拨者的阴谋诡计，唤起世界人民对那些坚持战争方针的人的神圣愤怒，提高一切爱好和平力量的组织性，不断加强群众保卫和平的积极行动，加强同一切不愿意有新战争的国家合作。在帝国主义者建立了军事基地的国家中，必须加强取消这些军事基地的斗争，这是巩固民族独立、维护主权和防止战争的重要条件。各国人民反对本国军国主义化的斗争，应当同反对和美国帝国主义者有联系的资本主义垄断组织的斗争结合起来。现在比任何时候更为重要的是，在每个国家内进行不屈不挠的斗争，使维护和平的运动能在城市和乡村，企业和机关中不断加强和扩大。保卫和平的运动是当代最广泛的运动，它包括具有不同政治信仰和宗教信仰，属于不同社会阶级，但为防止新战争、保障持久和平的崇高愿望所联合起来的人们。
    进一步加强世界社会主义体系，对维护持久和平具有首要的意义。在裁军没有实现之前，社会主义各国仍然必须使自己的国防力量保持应有的水平。
    共产党人认为，为了确保和平事业，首先必须解决下列任务：停止军备竞赛；禁止原子武器及其试验和生产；取消外国军事基地；从别国领土上撤退外国军队；解散军事集团；签订对德和约；使西柏林成为非军事化的自由城市；制止西德复仇主义者的侵略阴谋；不许日本军国主义复活。
    历史把防止新的世界战争的伟大责任，首先放在国际工人阶级的肩上。帝国主义者正在为发动热核战争而勾结和联合起来。国际工人阶级应该团结自己的队伍，拯救人类免于新世界战争的灾难。任何政治、宗教和其他问题方面的差别，都不应该妨碍团结工人阶级的一切力量去反对战争危险。用国际无产阶级一切队伍和组织的强大意志和统一行动来对抗战争势力，团结国际无产阶级的一切力量来防止战争和维护和平的时刻已经到来了！
    各国共产党把争取和平的斗争看作是自己的首要任务。它们号召工人阶级、工会、合作社、妇女和青年的团体和组织，全体劳动人民，不论其政治见解和宗教信仰如何，通过群众性的斗争给帝国主义者的任何侵略行动以坚决的反击。
    如果帝国主义狂人发动战争，世界人民将清除和埋葬资本主义。
    列宁的社会主义国家同资本主义国家实行和平共处和进行经济竞赛的原则，是社会主义各国对外政策的不可动摇的基础。在和平的条件下，社会主义制度在经济、文化和科学技术的一切方面对资本主义制度的优越性，正日益广泛地表现出来。不久的未来，和平和社会主义的力量将获得新的成就。苏联将成为世界第一个工业强国。中国将成为强大的工业国家。社会主义体系的工业产品将占世界工业产品的一半以上。和平地区将更加扩大。资本主义各国的工人运动和殖民地、附属国的民族解放运动将取得新的胜利。殖民主义体系将完全崩溃。社会主义和和平的力量将占绝对的优势。在这些条件下，在社会主义在地球上还没有取得完全胜利之前，在世界部分地区存在资本主义的情况下，将会出现把世界战争排除于社会生活之外的现实可能性。社会主义在全世界的胜利，将最终消除产生任何战争的社会原因和民族原因。
    全世界共产党人一致地始终不渝地坚持和平共处，为防止战争而坚决斗争。共产党人应当在群众中进行不倦的工作，以免于低估防止世界战争的可能性，低估和平共处的可能性，同时也免于低估战争的危险。
    在世界分裂为两个体系的情况下，国际关系中唯一正确的和明智的原则是弗·伊·列宁提出的不同社会制度国家和平共处的原则。这一原则在一九五七年莫斯科宣言和和平宣言中，在苏共第二十次和第二十一次代表大会的决议中，在其他共产党和工人党的文献中，得到了进一步的发展。
      中华人民共和国和印度共和国共同提出的和平共处五项原则，以及万隆会议所通过的原则，都符合和平和爱好和平人民的利益。
    是不同制度国家间的和平共处，还是破坏性的战争——现在问题就是这样摆着的。别的出路是没有的。共产党人坚决反对美国的“冷战”和“战争边缘”主义，因为它是导向热核灾难的政策。在坚持和平共处原则的同时，共产党人争取完全停止“冷战”，解散军事集团，取消军事基地，在国际监督下全面彻底裁军，通过谈判解决国际争端，尊重各个国家的平等、领土完整、独立和主权，互不干涉内政，广泛发展各国人民间的贸易、文化和科学的联系。
    和平共处政策符合各国人民的根本利益，符合所有那些不要新的流血战争而争取持久和平的人们的根本利益。这一政策，有助于社会主义阵地的巩固，有助于社会主义各国的威望和国际影响的增长，提高资本主义国家共产党的威信和影响。和平是社会主义的忠实同盟者，因为时间对社会主义有利，对资本主义不利。
    和平共处的路线是动员群众开展积极行动反对和平敌人的路线。
    各国间的和平共处，并不像修正主义者所断言的那样，意味着放弃阶级斗争。不同社会制度国家的共处是社会主义和资本主义间的阶级斗争的一种形式。在和平共处的条件下，出现着有助于在资本主义国家中开展阶级斗争、殖民地和附属国人民开展民族解放运动的可能性。同时，革命的阶级斗争和民族解放斗争的成就又促进和平共处的巩固。共产党人认为自己有责任，加强人民群众对巩固和平共处的可能性的信心，加强人民群众防止世界战争的决心。他们将竭力促进人民通过自己争取和平、民主和民族解放的积极斗争，日益削弱和缩小帝国主义的阵地。
    不同社会制度国家间的和平共处并不意味着社会主义思想和资产阶级思想的调和。相反，它要求工人阶级、所有共产党为争取社会主义思想的胜利而加强斗争。但是，各国之间的思想的和政治的争执不应该用战争来解决。
    会议认为，实现苏联提出的全面彻底裁军的计划对人类命运会具有历史性的意义。实现这一计划就意味着消除各国间进行战争的可能性。实现这个计划是一件不容易的事情。它遇到帝国主义者的顽强反抗。因此，就要为实现这一计划而向帝国主义侵略势力作积极的坚决的斗争。应该日益广泛地进行这种斗争，坚持不懈地争取达到现实的结果——禁止试验和生产核武器，取消军事集团和设在别国领土上的军事基地，大大裁减武装部队和军备，从而为普遍裁军扫清道路。社会主义国家、其他爱好和平的国家、国际工人阶级和各国广大的人民群众，进行积极的坚决的斗争，就有可能孤立侵略集团，使扩军备战遭到挫败，迫使帝国主义者接受普遍裁军协定。
    军备竞赛既不是抑制战争的因素，也不是人民高度就业和福利的因素。军备竞赛导向战争。只有一小撮垄断资本家和军火投机商才热中于军备竞赛。在资本主义国家里，要求缩减军费，并把由此节省下来的金钱用于改善人民群众的生活条件，是人民的经常要求。在每一个国家里，都必须开展广泛的群众运动，争取把裁军节省下来的金钱和物资用于和平生产、住宅建筑、保健事业、国民教育、社会保障、发展科学研究等方面的需要。现在裁军已经成为人民群众的战斗要求，成为业已成熟的历史的必需。必须用积极的坚决的斗争迫使帝国主义者执行各国人民的这一要求！
    社会主义各国的共产党和工人党今后仍将始终不渝地执行不同社会制度国家和平共处的路线，尽一切可能使各国人民免受新战争的恐怖和灾难。它们将对帝国主义表现最大的警惕性，全力巩固整个社会主义阵营的威力和国防力量，采取一切必要措施保障各国人民的安全和维护和平。
    共产党人认为自己的历史使命，不仅在于在世界范围内消灭剥削和贫困，以及从人类社会生活中永远消除任何战争的可能性，而且在于就在现时代使人类摆脱新的世界战争的惨祸。各国共产党将为实现这一伟大历史使命贡献出自己所有的力量和精力。
    四
    民族解放革命在世界的广大地区里取得了胜利。战后十五年来，在亚洲和非洲出现了将近四十个新的主权国家。古巴革命的胜利，有力地促进了拉丁美洲人民争取彻底的民族解放斗争。在人类生活中开始了一个新的历史时期：亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲获得了独立的人民开始积极地参加国际政治。
    殖民主义的完全崩溃是不可避免的。在民族解放运动的冲击下，殖民主义奴役制度的瓦解，就其历史意义说来，仅次于世界社会主义体系的形成。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命唤醒了东方，把殖民地人民卷入了全世界革命运动的洪流。苏联在第二次世界大战中的胜利，欧洲和亚洲一系列国家里人民民主制度的建立，中国社会主义革命的胜利，世界社会主义体系的形成，大大加速了这一过程的发展。世界社会主义的力量，对促进殖民地和附属国人民争取摆脱帝国主义压迫的斗争，起了决定性的作用。社会主义体系，已经成为获得了独立的人民实现独立自主的民族发展的可靠后盾。国际工人运动给民族解放运动以很大的支持。
    亚洲的面貌发生了根本变化。非洲的殖民主义制度正在崩溃。在拉丁美洲开辟了积极进行反帝斗争的战线。亚洲、非洲和世界其他地区亿万人的独立，是他们在同帝国主义进行残酷的搏斗中争取到的。共产党人从来就承认民族解放战争的进步的革命的意义，他们是争取民族独立的最积极的战士。世界社会主义体系的存在和帝国主义阵地的削弱，为被压迫人民争取独立开辟了新的可能性。
    殖民地各国人民根据本国的具体条件，通过武装斗争或者非战争的方式争取自己的独立。他们要在强大的民族解放运动的基础上，争取巩固的胜利。殖民主义国家不会把自由恩赐给殖民地人民，也不会自愿放弃被它们剥削的国家。
    美国是现代殖民主义的主要堡垒。以美国为首的帝国主义者，拚命用新的方法和新的形式，保持对原殖民地人民的殖民主义剥削。垄断组织企图在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家把经济控制和政治影响的命脉保持在自己手里。这种努力的目的，是想在经济“援助”的幌子下，在已经获得独立的国家的经济中，维持原有的阵地并夺取新的阵地，是要把已经获得独立的国家拉进军事集团，在这些国家中扶植军事独裁制度，建立军事基地。帝国主义者力图阉割和破坏已经获得独立的国家的主权，歪曲民族自决的含义，在所谓“互相依赖”的旗帜下，强制推行殖民主义统治的新形式，在这些国家中扶植自己的傀儡执政，收买资产阶级中的一部分人，利用民族纠纷这个恶毒的武器来削弱这些年轻的尚未巩固的国家的力量。侵略性的军事集团和侵略性的双边军事同盟，正被积极利用来达到这些目的。当地剥削阶级中最反动的集团是帝国主义者的同谋者。
    摆脱了殖民主义压迫的国家，只有在同帝国主义、同封建主义残余进行坚决斗争的条件下，把本民族的一切爱国力量结成民族民主统一战线，才能够顺利地解决民族复兴的迫切任务。巩固政治上的独立，进行符合农民利益的土地改革，消灭封建主义残余，清除帝国主义统治的经济根源，限制外国垄断组织并把它们从经济中排挤出去，建立和发展民族工业，提高居民的生活水平，使社会生活民主化，实行独立的爱好和平的外交政策，同社会主义国家及其他友好国家发展经济和文化合作——这些全民性的民主任务，就是已经获得独立的各国民族进步力量能够联合起来、而且实际上也正在联合起来的基础。
    在争取民族解放的斗争中起了杰出作用的工人阶级，主张把民族、反帝、民主革命的任务坚持到底，反对反动势力阻挠社会进步事业的企图。
    解决直接涉及大多数居民利益的农民问题，对这些国家具有头等重要的意义。不进行深刻的土地改革，就不能够解决粮食问题，就不能够清除束缚农业和工业生产力发展的一切中世纪残余。在这些国家里，在民主基础上建立和扩大国民经济中、特别是工业中不依赖外国垄断组织的和逐渐变成本国经济的决定性因素的国营成分，具有很大意义。
    工农联盟是争取和保卫民族独立，实现深刻的民主改革和保障社会进步的最重要的力量。这个联盟应该成为广泛的民族统一战线的基础。民族资产阶级参加解放斗争的程度，在不小的程度上也取决于这一联盟的力量和巩固性。在这一斗争中，一切民族爱国力量，全国一切准备为民族独立、反对帝国主义而斗争的人们，都能起很大的作用。
    在目前的条件下，殖民地和附属国的同帝国主义集团没有联系的民族资产阶级，客观上同反帝、反封建革命的基本任务的实现有着利害关系，因而能够参加反对帝国主义和封建主义的革命斗争。从这个意义来说，民族资产阶级具有进步性。然而它是动摇不定的，除了具有进步性以外，它还倾向于同帝国主义和封建主义妥协。由于民族资产阶级的两面性，它参加革命的程度在不同的国家是不相同的。这取决于具体的条件，取决于阶级力量对比的变化，取决于帝国主义、封建主义同人民群众之间的矛盾的尖锐程度，取决于帝国主义、封建主义同民族资产阶级之间的矛盾的深度。
    人民在获得政治独立以后，就会为现实生活所提出的社会问题和巩固民族独立问题寻求答案。不同的阶级和政党提出不同的解决办法。选择哪一条发展道路，这是各国人民自己内部的事情。随着社会矛盾的尖锐化，民族资产阶级越来越倾向于同国内反动派和帝国主义妥协。而人民群众确信，消灭长期落后状态和改善他们生活条件的最好道路，就是非资本主义发展的道路。人民只有走这条道路，才能摆脱剥削、贫困和饥饿。在解决这一根本的社会问题中，工人阶级和广大农民群众应当起最重要的作用。
    在现代的历史情况下，正在形成有利于在许多国家中建立独立的民族民主国家的国际条件和国内条件。这种独立的民族民主国家，就是：一贯维护自己的政治独立和经济独立，反对帝国主义及其军事集团，反对本国领土上的外国军事基地；反对各种新形式的殖民主义，反对帝国主义资本的渗透；拒绝专制独裁的管理方法；保证人民有广泛的民主权利和自由（言论、出版、集会、示威游行、建立政党和社会团体的自由），保证人民有可能争取进行土地改革和实现在民主改革和社会改革方面的其他要求以及参予决定国家的政策。民族民主国家的成立和巩固，使这些国家有可能沿着社会进步的道路迅速发展，有可能在各国人民争取和平、反对帝国主义阵营的侵略政策和争取彻底消灭殖民主义奴役的斗争中起积极的作用。
    共产党为彻底进行反帝反封建的民主革命，为建立民族民主国家，为坚决改善人民群众的生活，积极进行斗争。它们支持民族政府为巩固已经取得的成就和破坏帝国主义的阵地而采取的行动。同时，它们积极反对反民主、反人民的行动，反对统治集团危害民族独立的措施。共产党人揭露资产阶级中的反动派把自私的、狭隘的阶级利益冒充全民族的利益的企图，揭露资产阶级政客为了同样目的利用社会主义口号招摇撞骗，他们争取实现社会生活的真正民主化，联合一切进步力量为反对独裁制度或者制止建立这种制度的趋向而斗争。
    共产党人的目标符合民族的最高利益。反动集团企图在“反共主义”的旗帜下破坏民族战线，孤立解放运动的最先进部分——共产党人。这种企图削弱着民族运动的力量，违反人民的民族利益，使已经获得的民族成果有丧失的危险。
    社会主义国家是正在争取解放或者已经摆脱了帝国主义奴役和压迫的人民的真诚的和忠实的朋友。它们根本反对任何干涉年轻的民族国家内政的行为，它们认为促进各国人民争取巩固民族独立的斗争是自己的国际义务。它们对这些国家在沿着进步道路向前发展方面，在建立本国工业，在发展和巩固民族经济和培养本国干部方面给予大力的援助和支持，在争取世界和平、反对帝国主义侵略的斗争中同这些国家合作。
    宗主国觉悟的工人，一贯为受帝国主义压迫的民族获得自决进行斗争，他们认识到，“压迫其他民族的民族是不能自由的”。现在，当这些民族已经走上民族独立道路的时候，工业发达的资本主义国家的工人和一切民主力量的国际义务，就是给这些民族的反对帝国主义、争取和巩固民族独立的斗争以全力的支持，帮助他们顺利解决经济和文化复兴的任务。他们这样作，同时也是保卫本国人民群众的利益。
    完全彻底消灭殖民主义制度的一切形式和一切表现，是近几十年来整个世界历史进程所要求的。对于那些还处在殖民主义奴役下的所有人民，在他们争取民族独立方面应当给予全力的支持。必须废除一切形式的殖民主义压迫。消灭殖民主义，对缓和国际紧张局势和巩固普遍和平，也将具有极其伟大的意义。会议对亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和澳洲所有进行英勇反帝斗争的人民表示支持。会议向年青的非洲国家人民致敬，他们获得了政治独立，这是他们走向彻底解放的重要步骤。会议对为争取自由和民族独立而斗争的英雄的阿尔及利亚人民表示热烈的同情和支持，要求立即停止对阿尔及利亚的侵略战争。会议愤怒地谴责南非联邦的惨无人道的种族迫害和暴政，即“种族隔离”制度，并且呼吁国际民主舆论界积极支持南非人民争取自由和平等的斗争。会议要求不干涉古巴、刚果和一切已经获得独立的国家的人民的主权。
    一切社会主义国家、国际工人运动和共产主义运动认为，给予为摆脱帝国主义和殖民主义的压迫而斗争的人民以道义上和物质上的大力支援，是自己的义务。
    五
    世界舞台上新的力量对比，为共产党和工人党解决它们所面临的争取和平、民族独立、民主和社会主义斗争的历史任务，提供新的可能性。
    各国共产党根据本国的具体历史条件和社会条件，并且考虑到国际局势，来确定革命的前景和任务。它们进行忘我的斗争，争取在当前的条件下尽一切力量保卫工人阶级和人民群众的利益，改善他们的生活条件，扩大人民的民主权利和自由，而不把这些事情拖延到社会主义胜利的时候。工人阶级及其革命的先锋队认识到，他们自己肩负着为使本国人民摆脱资本压迫而斗争的主要重担，他们将在本国政治、经济和思想生活的一切领域里，向压迫者和剥削者的统治展开越来越有力的进攻。在这一斗争的过程中，锻炼群众，为推翻资本主义、争取社会主义革命的胜利进行决战创造着条件。
    在目前条件下，正越来越坚决地把主要打击针对着作为军备竞赛的祸首和反动与侵略的堡垒的资本主义垄断组织，针对着保卫垄断组织利益的整个国家垄断资本主义制度。
    在处于美国帝国主义政治、经济和军事统治下的非欧洲的某些发达的资本主义国家里，工人阶级和人民群众的主要打击是针对美国帝国主义的统治，也针对出卖民族利益的垄断资本和国内其他反动势力。在这一斗争的过程中，一切民主爱国的民族力量，也就是为获得真正的民族独立和民主革命胜利而斗争的力量，结成统一战线；而真正的民族独立和民主的取得，将为进而解决社会主义革命的任务创造条件。
    大垄断组织向工人阶级和广大人民群众的利益进行全线进攻。对劳动者的剥削正在加重，广大农民群众破产的过程也正在加速；同时，城市的中小资产阶级遇到的困难正在增加。大垄断组织的压迫，对于民族中各个阶层人民来说都变得越来越沉重了。结果，在资产阶级社会基本的阶级矛盾，即劳动和资本之间的矛盾不断尖锐化的同时，一小撮垄断资本家和各阶层人民之间的矛盾，在目前阶段也在加深。
    垄断组织力图消灭或者极度缩小人民群众的民主权利。在一些国家中，公开的法西斯恐怖继续猖狂肆虐。一些国家正在用下述新形式加强法西斯化的过程：独裁统治办法同虚伪的议会制度相结合，这种议会制度虚有其表，毫无民主内容。许多民主组织被宣布为非法，被迫转入地下，成千上万为工人阶级事业和和平事业而斗争的战士被抛进监狱。
    会议以全世界所有共产党人的名义，向在监狱里受折磨的美国、西班牙、葡萄牙、日本、西德、希腊、伊朗、巴基斯坦、阿联、约旦、伊拉克、阿根廷、巴拉圭、多米尼加、墨西哥、南非联邦、苏丹和其他国家的工人阶级的光荣儿女和民主主义者表示无产阶级的同情。会议号召展开强大的国际运动，争取释放为和平、民族独立和民主而斗争的战士。
    工人阶级、农民、知识分子、城市的中小资产阶级都同消灭垄断组织的统治有切身利害关系。团结这一切力量的有利条件正在形成。
    共产党人认为这种团结是完全可以实现的，其基础是：争取和平；争取民族独立；保卫和发展民主；争取对最重要经济部门实行国有化和管理民主化；争取把整个经济用于和平目的，以满足居民的需要；争取进行彻底的土地改革；争取改善劳动人民的生活条件；争取保护农民的利益和城市的中小资产阶级的利益，使他们免受垄断组织的危害。
    实现这一切，将是社会进步道路上的重要步骤，将符合民族中大多数人的利益。所有这些都带有民主性质，它们不消灭人对人的剥削。但是，这一切的实现，将限制垄断组织的力量，增强工人阶级在国家生活中的威信和政治分量，将有助于孤立最反动的力量和联合一切进步的力量。广大居民阶层参加争取民主改革的斗争，会使他们确信同工人阶级统一行动的必要性，会有助于提高他们的政治积极性。工人阶级及其共产主义先锋队的最重要的义务，是领导群众为实现民主改革、推翻垄断组织的统治进行经济斗争和政治斗争，并且保证这个斗争取得成就。
    共产党人主张经济生活和社会生活以及一切行政、政治、文化组织和机构的普遍民主化。
    共产党人把争取民主的斗争看作是争取社会主义斗争的组成部分。在这一斗争过程中，共产党人经常加强他们和群众的联系，提高群众的政治觉悟水平，使群众理解社会主义革命的任务和实现这一革命的必要性。马克思列宁主义政党同改良主义者的根本区别就在于此。改良主义者把资本主义制度范围内的改革看成是最终目的，否认社会主义革命的必要性。马克思列宁主义者坚信，资本主义国家人民在日常斗争的过程中将认识到，只有社会主义才是他们的真正出路。
    现在，当居民中越来越多的阶层积极投入阶级斗争的时候，共产党人在工会、合作社、农民、青年、妇女、体育团体和没有组织的居民中加强工作，具有非常重大的意义。现在出现了吸收年青一代参加争取和平与民主、争取共产主义伟大理想的斗争的新的可能性。列宁的伟大遗训——深入群众，哪里有群众，就在那里工作，加强同群众的联系，以便引导他们前进，应该成为每一个共产党最重要的任务。
    在工会运动遭到分裂的国家内和国际范围内，恢复工会运动的统一，对提高工人阶级在政治生活中的分量和胜利地捍卫工人阶级的利益，具有头等重要的意义。参加不同工会的劳动者有着共同的利益。在近几年来最大的阶级战斗中，每当各种不同工会共同行动的时候，正是由于团结一致，它们才争取到劳动者的要求得到满足。共产党认为，现在存在着恢复工会统一的现实前提，并且将为这一任务的实现而坚持不懈地努力。在那些实际上不存在工会民主的国家里，争取工会统一的斗争要求经常进行工作，以便获得工会运动的独立，并且使一切劳动者的工会权利得到承认和尊重，而不受政治的或者任何其他的歧视。
    和平和社会进步事业的利益，还要求恢复其他一切群众性民主运动在国内的统一和在国际上的统一。在维护和平、争取民族独立、维护和扩大民主权利、改善劳动者的生活条件和扩大他们的社会权利的斗争中采取统一行动的基础上，可以实现群众组织的统一。
    作为社会革命主要动力的工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟，在资本主义国家人民群众争取实现自己的任务的斗争中，起着决定性的作用。
    工人阶级队伍的分裂仍然是工人阶级达到自己目的的道路上的主要障碍。统治阶级、社会民主党右翼领袖和工会的反动领袖热中于在本国和在国际范围内保持这种分裂。共产党人坚决主张克服这种分裂。
    帝国主义者和各国反动派为了分裂和破坏工人阶级的团结，在使用镇压手段的同时，还采取欺骗和收买的办法。近几年来的事件再一次证明，这种分裂会破坏工人阶级的阵地，只有利于帝国主义反动派。
    某些右翼社会民主党领袖公开转向帝国主义立场，维护资本主义体系，分裂工人阶级。由于敌视共产主义，害怕社会主义在世界舞台上日益增长的影响，他们向反动保守势力投降。在一些国家里，右翼领导使社会民主党通过了公开背弃马克思主义和阶级斗争、背弃传统的社会主义口号的纲领。他们以此再次向资产阶级效劳。社会民主党中对右翼领袖这一政策的反抗正在增长，它们的一部分工作人员也参加了这一反抗。赞同工人阶级和其他劳动者在争取和平、民主和社会进步的斗争中所采取的行动的力量正在增长。社会民主党中的绝大多数人，特别是工人，都拥护和平和社会进步。
    共产党人将继续批评社会民主党的思想立场和右倾机会主义的实践，并且将继续进行工作，促使社会民主党群众转到为反对资本主义、争取社会主义胜利而进行彻底的阶级斗争的立场上来。共产党人坚信，他们和社会民主党人的思想分歧，不应该妨碍对有关工人运动的已经成熟的问题，对共同斗争，特别是反对战争危险的斗争，交换意见。
    共产党人把社会民主党人中的劳动者看作自己的阶级弟兄。共产党人常常同他们在工会和其它组织中一起进行工作，并为工人阶级和全体人民的利益进行共同的斗争。
    工人运动的根本利益迫切要求共产党和社会民主党在国内和国际上采取共同行动，以争取立即禁止生产、试验和使用核武器，建立无原子区，在国际监督下实现全面彻底裁军，取消设在他国领土上的军事基地，撤退外国军队，援助殖民地和附属国人民的民族解放运动，保障国家主权，加强民主和反击法西斯威胁，提高劳动者的生活水平，在不减少工资的条件下缩短工作周等等。成百万的社会民主党人和某些社会民主党，已经通过这种或那种形式表示赞成解决这些任务。可以大胆地说，许多资本主义国家的工人阶级，如果克服了自己队伍的分裂，使自己的所有队伍统一行动，就能够给资本主义国家的统治集团的政策以沉重的打击，迫使它们停止准备新战争，就能够击退垄断资本的进攻，就能够保证自己迫切的生活要求和民主要求得到满足。
    在争取改善劳动者的生活条件、扩大和维护他们的民主权利、争取和保卫民族独立、争取各国人民间的和平的斗争中，以及在夺取政权和建设社会主义的斗争中，共产党都主张同社会党建立合作。共产党人有严整的有科学根据的并由现实生活所证实的伟大的马克思列宁主义学说，有丰富的社会主义建设的国际经验。他们愿意同社会民主党人进行辩论，确信这是最好的办法，可以把观点、思想和积累起来的经验加以比较，以便消除根深蒂固的成见，克服劳动者的分裂状态，建立合作。
    帝国主义反动派力图引起对共产主义运动及其意识形态的怀疑，继续吓唬群众，说什么共产党人需要用国与国之间的战争来推翻资本主义制度，建立社会主义制度。共产党坚决驳斥这种诽谤。帝国主义者所发动的两次世界大战的结果都发生了社会主义革命这个事实，绝不意味着走向社会革命的道路一定要通过世界大战，特别是在我们这个存在着强大的世界社会主义体系的时代。马克思列宁主义者从来没有认为，走向社会革命的道路要通过国与国之间的战争。
    选择这一种或那一种社会制度，这是每一国家人民的不可剥夺的权利。社会主义革命不能输入，也不可能从外部强加于人。它是每个国家内部发展和社会矛盾极端尖锐化的结果。共产党遵循马克思列宁主义学说，从来反对革命输出。同时，它们坚决反对帝国主义的反革命输出。它们认为自己的国际义务是号召各国人民团结起来，动员自己的一切内部力量，积极行动起来，并且依靠世界社会主义体系的力量，防止和坚决回击帝国主义者干涉任何一个国家的奋起革命的人民的事务。
    马克思列宁主义政党领导工人阶级和劳动群众进行斗争，以实现社会主义革命，建立这种或者那种形式的无产阶级专政。社会主义革命的形式和发展道路，将取决于这一个或者那一个国家内的阶级力量的具体对比，取决于工人阶级及其先锋队的组织性和成熟程度，取决于统治阶级的反抗程度。不论建立什么形式的无产阶级专政，这一专政永远意味着扩大民主，意味着从资产阶级的形式上的民主过渡到真正的民主即劳动人民的民主。
    各国共产党重申一九五七年宣言关于不同国家从资本主义向社会主义过渡的各种形式问题的论点。
    宣言指出：工人阶级及其先锋队——马克思列宁主义的党力图通过和平的方式实现社会主义革命。这种可能如果能实现，对于工人阶级和全体人民，对于全民族，都是有利的。
    在目前条件下，在一些资本主义国家里，以自己的先进部队为首的工人阶级，有可能在工人阵线和人民阵线的基础上，在不同的党派和社会团体达成各种可能形式的协议和建立各种可能形式的政治合作的基础上，把大多数的人民团结起来，不经过内战而取得国家政权，从而保证使基本生产资料转入人民手中。工人阶级依靠人民的大多数，并且坚决打击那些对于资本家和地主不肯放弃妥协政策的机会主义分子，就有可能击败反动的、反人民的势力，取得议会中的稳定的多数，使议会从为资产阶级的阶级利益服务的工具，变成为劳动人民服务的工具，同时开展议会外的广泛的群众斗争，摧毁反动势力的反抗，为和平实现社会主义革命准备必要的条件。只有广泛地、不断地开展工农群众和城市中等阶层反对大垄断资本，反对反动派，争取深刻的社会改革，争取和平和社会主义的阶级斗争，才能实现这一切。
    在剥削阶级对人民使用暴力的条件下，就必须考虑另外一种可能，即非和平地过渡到社会主义。列宁主义教导我们，而且历史经验也证明，统治阶级是不会自愿让出政权的。这样，阶级斗争的剧烈程度和所采取的形式，与其说是决定于无产阶级，不如说是决定于反动集团对于绝大多数人民的意志抵抗到什么程度，决定于在争取社会主义斗争的这一或那一阶段上这些集团是不是采取暴力。
    在每一个国家里，哪一种向社会主义过渡的方式具有现实可能性，决定于具体的历史条件。
    在我们的时代，当共产主义已经不仅是最先进的学说，而且是实际存在的、已经证明比资本主义优越的社会制度的时候，正在创造着特别有利的条件，以扩大共产党的影响，坚决揭露资产阶级用来反对无产阶级的“反共主义”。吸引最广大的劳动者阶层到共产主义思想方面来。
    反共主义，作为资产阶级同无产阶级和马克思主义思想进行斗争的主要思想武器，早在工人运动的初期就已经产生。随着阶级斗争的尖锐化，特别是随着世界社会主义体系的形成，反共主义变得更加恶毒和阴险了。反共主义反映着资产阶级思想体系的深刻的思想危机和极端严重的退化程度。它骇人听闻地歪曲马克思主义学说，粗暴地诬蔑社会主义的社会制度，捏造共产党人的政策和目的，迫害民主的和爱好和平的力量和组织。
    胜利地保卫劳动者的利益，维护和平事业，实现工人阶级的社会主义理想，这一切都要求同反共主义——这个资产阶级用来把群众同社会主义隔离开来的恶毒武器，进行坚决的斗争。必须向群众加强社会主义思想的宣传，用革命精神教育劳动者，提高他们的阶级觉悟和革命觉悟，并且根据世界社会主义体系各国的经验向所有劳动者揭示社会主义社会的优越性，向他们具体指明，社会主义给每个国家的工人、农民和其他居民阶层带来那些实际利益。
    共产主义使人们摆脱对战争的恐惧，保证持久和平；使人们摆脱帝国主义压迫、剥削、失业和贫穷，使人人生活有保障，保证他们有高度的物质生活水平；使他们摆脱对经济危机的恐惧，使生产力蓬勃发展，以造福整个社会；摆脱金钱对个性的压迫，使人们的精神得到全面发展，各种才能得到充分发挥，使社会在科学文化方面获得无限进步。除掉一小撮剥削者以外，居民的各个阶层都会从新社会制度的胜利中得到好处。必须使资本主义国家的千百万群众了解这一点。
    六
    世界共产主义运动已经成了我们时代影响最大的政治力量，成了社会进步的最重要的因素。在为了工人阶级和全体劳动者的利益，为了和平、民族独立、民主和社会主义而同帝国主义反动势力进行的激烈斗争中，共产主义运动在不断地前进，在团结起来和受到锻炼。
    目前，世界八十七个国家中有共产党在活动。这些党的队伍中共有三千六百多万人。这是马克思列宁主义的辉煌胜利，是工人阶级的巨大成就。在摆脱了殖民主义压迫、走上了独立发展道路的国家里，具有共同思想的马克思主义者正在继续联合起来。各国共产党认为自己的国际义务是：在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中，促进本国工人阶级同获得独立的国家的工人运动之间的友谊和团结的巩固。
    各国共产党队伍的成长和它们在组织上的巩固，一些国家共产党在反对各种倾向的斗争中所取得的胜利，个人迷信的有害后果的克服，国际共产主义运动
  影响的加强，这一切都在为胜利地解决各国共产党所面临的任务开辟新的前景。
      马克思列宁主义政党认为，在民主集中制原则的
  基础上严格遵守党内生活的列宁主义准则是自己活动
  的确定不移的法则，必须像保护眼珠一样维护党的统一，严格遵守党内民主和集体领导的原则，根据列宁主义的组织原则重视党的领导机关在党的生活中所起的作用，同时不倦地关心加强这些领导机关同党员以及广大劳动群众之间的联系，不允许有束缚共产党员发挥创造性思想和主动性的个人迷信，大力发扬共产党员的积极性，在自己队伍中开展批评和自我批评。
    各国共产党在思想上粉碎了自己队伍中企图使党离开马克思列宁主义道路的修正主义者。在同修正主义、右倾机会主义的斗争中，每个共产党和整个国际共产主义运动都在思想上和组织上得到了进一步的巩固。
    各国共产党一致谴责国际机会主义的南斯拉夫变种——现代修正主义者的“理论”的集中表现。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的领导人背叛了马克思列宁主义，宣布马克思列宁主义已经过时，用自己的反列宁主义的修正主义纲领同一九五七年宣言相对抗，把南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟同整个国际共产主义运动对立起来，使自己的国家脱离了社会主义阵营，使它依赖美国帝国主义者和其他帝国主义者的所谓“援助”，从而使南斯拉夫人民的英勇斗争所取得的革命成果有失去的危险。南斯拉夫修正主义者进行着反对社会主义阵营和世界共产主义运动的破坏工作。他们以非集团政策为借口，进行着有害于一切爱好和平力量和国家的团结的活动。进一步揭露南斯拉夫修正主义者的领导人，为了使共产主义运动和工人运动不受南斯拉夫修正主义者的反列宁主义思想的影响而积极斗争，仍然是各国马克思列宁主义政党的一项必要任务。
    工人阶级斗争的实践，社会发展的整个进程，再一次光辉地证明了马克思列宁主义的伟大的战无不胜的力量和生命力，有力地驳倒了现代修正主义者的一切“理论”。
    正如一九五七年莫斯科宣言所指出的，共产主义运动和工人运动进一步发展的利益，要求今后继续在两条战线上进行坚决斗争——反对仍然是主要危险的修正主义，也反对教条主义和宗派主义。
    修正主义，右倾机会主义，歪曲马克思列宁主义，阉割马克思列宁主义的革命灵魂，在理论上和实践上反映资产阶级思想，麻痹工人阶级的革命意志，在反对帝国主义者和剥削者的压迫的斗争中，在争取和平、民主和民族解放的斗争中，在争取社会主义胜利的斗争中，使工人和劳动群众解除武装，使他们涣散。
    如果不同教条主义和宗派主义进行始终不渝的斗争，它们在理论上和实践上也可能成为某些党在这一或那一发展阶段上的主要危险。它们使革命政党不能在科学分析的基础上发展马克思列宁主义，不能根据具体条件创造性地运用马克思列宁主义。它们使共产党人脱离广大劳动人民阶层，使共产党人在革命斗争中消极等待或者采取左倾冒险行动，使他们不能及时地正确地估计变化中的局势和新的经验，使他们在反对帝国主义、反对反动派和战争危险的斗争中不能利用一切可能性以有利于工人阶级和所有民主力量的胜利，从而妨碍各国人民在他们的正义斗争中取得胜利。
    在帝国主义反动派联合自己的力量来反对共产主义的条件下，尤其有必要尽一切力量团结世界共产主义运动。一致和团结，使我们运动的力量成倍地增长，并且为伟大共产主义事业的胜利前进和在击退敌人的一切进攻方面取得成就提供可靠的保证。
    伟大的马克思列宁主义学说和为实现这个学说而进行的共同斗争，把全世界共产党人联合起来。共产主义运动的利益，要求每个共产党本着团结的精神，遵守各兄弟党在会议上共同确定的有关反对帝国主义、争取和平、民主和社会主义斗争的共同任务的估计和结论。
    为工人阶级的事业而斗争的利益，要求日益加强每个共产党的队伍的团结，加强所有国家共产党人巨大队伍的团结，要求它们意志统一和行动统一。关心不断加强国际共产主义运动的团结，是每个马克思列宁主义政党的最高的国际义务。
    坚决保卫国际共产主义运动在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则基础上的团结，不允许能够破坏这种团结的任何行动，是在争取民族独立、民主与和平、争取顺利地解决社会主义革命、社会主义和共产主义建设的任务的斗争中取得胜利的必要条件。违背这些原则，就会导致共产主义力量的削弱。
    所有马克思列宁主义政党都是独立的、平等的，它们从本国的具体条件出发，遵循着马克思列宁主义原则制定政策，并且相互支持。每一个国家的工人阶级事业要获得成功，需要所有马克思列宁主义政党的国际主义的同情支持。每个党都对本国的工人阶级和劳动人民负责，都对整个国际工人运动和共产主义运动负责。
    共产党和工人党根据需要举行会议来讨论迫切的问题，交流经验，互相了解彼此的观点和立场，通过协商途径得到一致的观点，协调在争取共同目标的斗争中的共同行动。
    当某一个党遇有同另一个兄弟党的活动有关的问题时，由这个党的领导方面向有关党的领导方面提出，必要时进行会谈和协商。
    最近几年来举行的各国共产党代表会谈的经验和结果，特别是两次最大的会议——一九五七年十一月会议和这次会议的结果表明：在目前条件下，这种会议是相互交换意见和经验、通过集体努力丰富马克思列宁主义理论和在争取共同目标的斗争中确定一致立场的有效形式。
    共产党和工人党一致声明：苏联共产党——国际共产主义运动中最有经验和久经考验的队伍，过去是、今后仍然是世界共产主义运动的公认的先锋队。苏联共产党在争取工人阶级胜利的斗争中，在社会主义建设和实现全面共产主义建设中所积累的经验，对整个国际共产主义运动具有原则性的意义。苏联共产党的榜样及其兄弟般的同情，鼓舞着所有共产党进行争取和平和社会主义的斗争，并且是在实践中运用无产阶级国际主义革命原则的表现。苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的历史性决议，不但对于苏共和苏联的共产主义建设具有伟大的意义，而且开辟了国际共产主义运动的新阶段，促进了它在马克思列宁主义基础上的进一步发展。
    各国共产党和工人党对于马克思列宁主义伟大学说的发展，都在作出自己的贡献。在所有马克思列宁主义兄弟党之间的关系中，相互援助和支持是无产阶级国际主义革命原则的实际运用。
    在目前条件下，思想问题具有特殊的意义。剥削阶级用日益加紧从思想上腐蚀群众的办法对抗社会主义的成就，竭力使群众继续作资产阶级思想的精神俘虏。共产党人认为自己的任务是：在思想战线上展开坚决的进攻，力求把人民群众从各种各样的资产阶级思想的精神奴役下，其中包括从改良主义的有害影响下解放出来，力求在群众中传播保证社会进步的先进思想，传播爱好自由的民主思想和科学社会主义的思想。
    历史经验表明，就是在社会主义制度建立以后，在一个长时期内，人们意识中还会有资本主义的残余。这就使党有必要展开巨大的全面的工作，对群众进行共产主义教育，加强党和国家干部的马克思列宁主义修养和锻炼。
    马克思列宁主义是统一的伟大的革命学说，是全世界工人阶级和劳动人民争取和平、自由和美好生活，争取建立最合理的社会——共产主义的伟大战斗的一切阶段上的指路明星。它的伟大的创造性的改造力量在于，它同生活有着不可分割的联系，它在全面分析现实的基础上不断丰富起来。在马克思列宁主义的基础上，社会主义国家大家庭、国际共产主义运动、国际工人运动和解放运动取得了伟大的历史性的胜利，并且只有在这个基础上，才能胜利地解决摆在各国共产党和工人党面前的一切任务。
    会议参加者认为，各国共产党在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的进一步团结，是联合工人阶级的一切力量、联合民主和进步力量的最重要的条件，是世界共产主义运动和工人运动在它们争取全人类的光明未来、争取和平和社会主义事业胜利的伟大斗争中取得新胜利的保证。
