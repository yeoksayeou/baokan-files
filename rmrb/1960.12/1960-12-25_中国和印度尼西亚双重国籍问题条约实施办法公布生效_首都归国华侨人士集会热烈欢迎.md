Xinhua News Agency, December 24th. Returned Overseas Chinese in the capital gathered this evening, enthusiastically welcoming the announcement and implementation of the implementation measures for the treaty on the question of dual nationality between our country and Indonesia, and fully supporting the implementation of the treaty.

The meeting was presided over by Zhuang Xiquan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese.

Participants in the symposium unanimously agreed that the reasonable resolution of the issue of dual nationality for Overseas Chinese has opened the way for a comprehensive resolution of the Indonesian Overseas Chinese issue. This is not only beneficial to Overseas Chinese with dual nationality but also conducive to the friendship between the people of China and Indonesia and the further development of bilateral relations. Wu Yixiu, member of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and Vice Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, used many facts at the symposium to illustrate the flesh-and-blood ties and friendship established between Overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people in their long-term joint labor, life, and struggle. He said: The announcement and implementation of the implementation measures for the treaty on the question of dual nationality will lay a good and concrete foundation for resolving the dual nationality issue of Indonesian Overseas Chinese. We believe that as long as both sides work together in a spirit of friendship and cooperation, the treaty on the question of dual nationality will definitely be implemented smoothly.

Zhang Guoji, a returned Overseas Chinese from Indonesia and principal of the Beijing Returned Overseas Chinese Students' Preparatory School, said that the signing of the implementation measures for the treaty on the question of dual nationality between the Chinese and Indonesian governments is a good example of resolving international disputes through the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Fang Yanling, a returned Overseas Chinese from Indonesia this year and former chairman of the Wanlong Overseas Chinese Association, said that the announcement and implementation of the dual nationality treaty proves that problems between countries can be resolved through peaceful consultation. It proves that all imperialists' attempts to undermine the friendship between China and Indonesia are bound to fail.

Many people at the symposium praised the close friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people and expressed their efforts to continue to enhance and consolidate the friendship between the two peoples. Wu Shihuang, a returned Overseas Chinese from Indonesia and lecturer in the Department of Oriental Languages at Peking University, said: The people of China and Indonesia not only have brotherly friendship but also have a traditional militant friendship against colonialism. This militant friendship has gained further conditions for development after the implementation measures for the treaty on the question of dual nationality came into effect.

The following also spoke at the symposium: Li Mei, Zhao Wenhua, Zheng Zhengren, Cai Zhongchang, Pan Huadian, Zhang Chukun, Zeng Caitang, Huang Muyou, Chen Luwei, and others.

    首都归国华侨人士集会热烈欢迎
    新华社24日讯　首都归国华侨人士今天晚间集会，热烈欢迎我国和印度尼西亚政府关于双重国籍问题的条约的实施办法的公布生效，并且全力支持条约的实施。
    会议由中华全国归国华侨联合会副主席庄希泉主持。
    参加座谈会的人一致认为：华侨双重国籍问题的合理解决，为全面解决印度尼西亚华侨问题开辟了道路，这不仅有利于具有双重国籍的华侨，也有利于中国和印度尼西亚两国人民友好和两国关系的进一步发展。中华全国归国华侨联合会委员、北京市侨联副主席吴益修在座谈会上用许多事实说明华侨和印度尼西亚人民在长期共同劳动、生活和斗争中建立起来的血肉般的联系和友谊。他说：关于双重国籍问题的条约的实施办法的公布生效，这将为解决印度尼西亚华侨的双重国籍问题打下良好和具体的基础。我们相信，只要双方本着友好合作的精神，共同努力，关于双重国籍问题的条约就一定能够顺利实施。
    印度尼西亚归国华侨、北京归国华侨学生中等补习学校校长张国基说：中国和印度尼西亚两国政府关于双重国籍问题的条约的实施办法的签订，是用和平共处五项原则解决国际争端的一个良好范例。今年5月从印度尼西亚归国的华侨、前万隆华侨公会主席房延陵说：双重国籍问题条约实施办法的公布生效，证明国家和国家之间的问题都是可以经过和平协商的方法得到解决的。证明一切帝国主义者企图破坏中国和印度尼西亚两国的友谊是必然要失败的。
    许多人在座谈会上称颂中国和印度尼西亚人民的亲密友谊，并表示为继续增进和巩固两国人民的友谊而努力。印度尼西亚归国华侨、北京大学东方语言系讲师吴世璜说：中国和印度尼西亚两国人民不仅有着兄弟般的友谊，而且有着传统的反对殖民主义的战斗友谊，这种战斗友谊随着关于双重国籍问题条约的实施办法生效后，又获得了进一步发展的条件。
    在座谈会上发言的还有：李梅、赵文华、郑正仁、蔡钟长、潘华典、张楚琨、曾彩堂、黄木友、陈露薇等。
