Xinhua News Agency, December 18th: Commercial departments in various regions are taking effective measures to vigorously promote the complete set supply of farmland irrigation and drainage machinery. According to statistics up to the end of October, commercial departments in Liaoning and Jilin provinces and Beijing Municipality have achieved complete set supply for over 95% of the irrigation and drainage machinery they handle; Jiangxi, Hebei, Henan, and Fujian provinces have also reached over 90%.

Power units, water pumps, water pipes, transmission belts, and electrical equipment used for farmland irrigation and drainage are produced by relevant factories according to the state's planned arrangements for complete sets. Commercial departments are responsible for supplying these irrigation and drainage machines to the countryside as complete sets. To do this work well, commercial departments in many regions, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, have established special organizations such as complete set committees and complete set offices in coordination with relevant departments to vigorously promote complete set work. The Xinxiang and Luoyang Prefectural Commercial Bureaus in Henan Province have specifically established a complete set section, while county commercial bureaus have established complete set divisions, and basic-level stores have complete set personnel, with people responsible at each level. In Liaoning Province, after establishing special organizations, a hierarchical responsibility system of provincial planning for complete sets, municipal and prefectural adjustment for complete sets, and county guarantee for complete set supply was implemented, ensuring the smooth progress of the complete set work.

In organizing complete set work, commercial departments in various regions first pay attention to strengthening industrial and commercial cooperation, doing everything possible to ensure that products arranged by the state as complete sets can complete tasks on schedule, according to variety and specifications. The commercial department of Hebei Province dispatched twelve resident factory staff to go deep into relevant factories and workshops to assist in the work, helping factories to adjust and resolve the problem of insufficient auxiliary materials. A five-part form method is also implemented for the delivery of farmland irrigation and drainage machinery products from the factory, i.e., when the power unit leaves the factory, a five-part form is issued, with parts one, two, and three sent to the superior authority in charge, the receiving unit, and kept for self-retention, respectively; part four is sent to the matching water pump factory, and part five is sent to the matching water pipe factory, thus strengthening the connection between the matching factories and promoting the timely completion of the planned production of matching products. Commercial departments in Shandong Province have established resident factory groups in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Shenyang, which regularly contact factories producing irrigation and drainage machinery to understand production conditions, promptly purchase and organize complete sets, basically achieving simultaneous production, simultaneous completion, simultaneous transfer, and simultaneous supply.

For partially incomplete products purchased, commercial departments in various regions have generally adopted methods such as clearing warehouses, adjusting surpluses and shortages, and economizing with substitutes to increase the proportion of complete sets supplied as much as possible. Special districts in Henan Province generally held complete set exchange meetings of varying scales, where various regions reported their inventory, adjusted surpluses and shortages, and replenished whatever was lacking. In addition, commercial departments in many regions, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, launched mass movements for technical innovation and technical revolution, widely using substitutes to solve the problem of complete sets. Longxi and Jinjiang prefectures in Fujian Province used indigenous coal gas stoves instead of iron coal gas stoves. Kaifeng Prefecture in Henan Province used canvas to make rubber tubes, wood to make oilers, and substitutes to make distributor caps and other accessories, saving a large amount of raw rubber and steel for the country.

### 成套生产排灌机械　成套供应排灌机械  各地商业部门同工厂加强协作共同做好配套工作

    成套生产排灌机械　成套供应排灌机械
    各地商业部门同工厂加强协作共同做好配套工作
    新华社18日讯　各地商业部门正在采取有效措施，大抓农田排灌机械的配套供应工作。据到10月底的统计，辽宁、吉林两省和北京市商业部门经营的排灌机械95％以上做到了成套供应；江西、河北、河南、福建等省也都达到90％以上。
    用于农田排灌的动力机、水泵、水管、传动带和电器设备等，是由国家有计划地成套安排各有关工厂生产的。商业部门担负着把排灌机械配成套供应农村的任务。为了做好这一工作，不少地区商业部门在党委统一领导下，协同有关部门建立了配套委员会、配套办公室等专门机构，大抓配套工作。河南省新乡、洛阳专区商业局专门成立了配套科，县商业局成立配套股，基层商店设配套员，层层有人负责。辽宁省在建立专门机构以后，实行了省计划配套，市和专区调剂配套，县保证配套供应的分级负责办法，保证了配套工作的顺利进行。
    各地商业部门在组织配套工作中，首先注意加强工商协作，千方百计促使国家成套安排的产品能够按计划、按品种规格、按时间完成任务。河北省商业部门派出驻厂员十二人，深入有关工厂、车间协助工作，帮助工厂调剂解决了部分辅助材料不足的问题。对于农田排灌机械产品出厂还实行五联单办法，即动力机出厂时开出五联单，除一、二、三联分别送主管上级、接货单位、自己留存外，第四联送配套水泵厂、第五联送配套水管厂，这样就加强了各配套厂之间的联系，推动了配套产品按时完成计划。山东省商业部门在上海、天津、沈阳设立了驻厂组，经常同生产排灌机械的工厂联系，了解生产情况，及时收购和组织配套，基本上做到随生产，随配套，随调运，随供应。
    各地商业部门对于收购进来的部分不成套的产品，普遍采取清理仓库、调剂余缺、节约代用等办法，尽可能提高成套供应的比重。河南省各专区普遍召开规模大小不等的配套交流会议，各地自报库存，调剂余缺，缺啥补啥。此外，还有不少地区商业部门在党委统一领导下，发动群众开展技术革新和技术革命运动，广泛利用代用品来解决配套问题。福建省龙溪、晋江专区，用土煤气炉代替铁制煤气炉。河南省开封专区用帆布制成胶管，用木头制成滑油器，并用代用品做成分电盘等配件，为国家节约了大量生胶和钢铁。（附图片）
