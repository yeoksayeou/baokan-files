Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 11th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, Vietnam's heavy industry sector has achieved tremendous success in the Three-Year Plan, with the total output value of heavy industry increasing more than twofold in three years.

This was stated by Vu Anh, Deputy Minister of the Vietnamese Ministry of Heavy Industry, to a Vietnam News Agency reporter recently. He said that thanks to the tremendous efforts of all cadres and workers in the production competition movement, and thanks to the selfless assistance of fraternal countries, Vietnam's heavy industry sector has achieved significant victories. If 1957 is taken as the base, the total output value of heavy industry this year is equivalent to 322% of 1957, with an average annual growth of 47.5%. The number of production units has increased from nineteen to thirty-five. In the past, Vietnam could only extract a small amount of minerals, but now, in addition to producing coal, tin, and chemical fertilizers, it also mines apatite, chromite, and produces machine tools, pig iron, electric motors, small internal combustion engines, rice milling machines, etc. Over the past three years, the output of many products has grown quite rapidly, such as power generation, which has increased twofold, coal by 2.3 times, cement by 2.5 times, tin by 4.5 times, machinery by six times, and apatite by 7.6 times. Among them, the machinery manufacturing industry did not exist before the war. Currently, the products produced by the heavy industry sector in North Vietnam not only meet their own construction needs, but also have a considerable quantity for export.

When talking about the development prospects of Vietnam's heavy industry, Vu Anh said that the level of heavy industrial production is expected to increase by 25.4% next year compared to this year, labor productivity will increase by 13%, and product costs will decrease by 5.5%.

According to Hanoi newspapers, in the past three years, the total output value of the machinery manufacturing industry of Vietnam's heavy industry sector increased fortyfold in 1959 compared to 1957. Currently, it can not only manufacture general machinery, but also some relatively precise machine tools. The total output value of the Hanoi Machinery Factory in 1959 increased by 618% compared to 1958. The Tran Hung Dao Machinery Factory increased by 270%. The total output value of the various enterprises of the General Bureau of Water and Land Transportation in 1959 increased by nearly twofold compared to 1956.

In addition to the good results achieved by the central state-owned enterprises, local mechanical industries have also achieved great successes. In the past year alone, local industries have manufactured 59,000 improved agricultural implements, 240,000 old-fashioned agricultural implements, 500 water-drawing tools, and 450 various simple transportation tools, making significant contributions to improving farming techniques and developing other economic sectors in various regions. This year, all plain and mountainous provinces in North Vietnam have established local machinery manufacturing industries.

The output of various joint state-private machinery manufacturing enterprises, after the implementation of socialist transformation, has also been significantly improved. In 1959, the productivity of joint state-private mechanical industries increased by an average of 20% to 30% compared to before the merger.

In order to increase production and improve labor efficiency, the machinery manufacturing sector launched an enthusiastic labor competition. According to calculations in the first few months of this year alone, the staff and workers of the Hanoi Machinery Factory and the Tran Hung Dao Machinery Factory put forward 178 technical innovation proposals, respectively increasing labor productivity by 100% to 700%. Since 1958, the machine repair units under the Railway General Bureau have put forward a total of 1,100 innovation proposals, both large and small, increasing productivity by 10% to 6000%, and saving the country more than 300,000 Vietnamese dong.

    全体职工热烈开展竞赛运动大力革新技术
    越南重工业总产值三年增长两倍多
    满足国内需要外还有相当数量出口
    新华社河内11日电　据越南通讯社消息：越南重工业部门在三年计划中取得了巨大的胜利，重工业的总产值在三年内增长了两倍多。
    这是越南重工业部副部长武英最近对越南通讯社记者讲的。他说，由于全体干部和工人们在生产竞赛运动中作出了巨大的努力，由于各兄弟国家的无私援助，越南重工业部门已经取得了重大胜利。如果以1957年为基数，今年的重工业总产值相当于1957年的322％，每年平均增长47.5％，生产单位已经从十九个发展到三十五个。过去越南只能开采少量矿产，而现在除了生产煤、锡、化学肥料之外，还开采磷灰石、铬铁，生产工作母机、生铁、电动机、小型内燃机、碾米机等。三年来，许多产品的产量增长得相当快，如发电量增长两倍，煤增长二点三倍，水泥增长二点五倍，锡增长四点五倍，机器增长六倍，磷灰石增长七点六倍。其中，机器制造业在战前是根本没有的。目前，越南北方重工业部门所生产的产品不仅能满足自己的建设需要，而且还有相当数量出口。
    武英在谈到越南重工业的发展前景时说，重工业生产的水平预计明年将比今年增长25.4％，劳动生产率将提高13％，产品成本将降低5.5％。
    另据河内报纸报道，三年来，越南重工业部门机器制造业的总产值1959年比1957年增长了四十倍，目前不仅能够制造一般的机器，而且能够制造一些较精密的工作母机。河内机器厂1959年的总产值比1958年增长618％。陈兴道机器厂增长270％。水陆交通总局的各个企业1959年的总产值比1956年增长近两倍。
    除了中央国营企业取得的良好成绩之外，地方机械工业也取得了巨大的成绩。仅最近一年来，地方工业就制造了五万九千件改良农具、二十四万件旧式农具、五百件戽水用具、四百五十件各种简易运输工具，对改进耕作技术和发展各地其他经济部门作出了巨大的贡献。今年全北方所有平原和山区省份都建立了地方机械制造工业。
    在实行了社会主义改造之后的各公私合营机械制造企业的产量，也有显著的提高，1959年公私合营机械工业的生产率平均比未合营前提高20％—30％。
    为了增加生产，提高劳动效率，机器制造业部门展开了热烈的劳动竞赛。仅据今年头几个月的计算，河内机器厂和陈兴道机器厂的职工们就提出了一百七十八项技术革新建议，分别把劳动生产率提高100％—700％。铁路总局所属的机器修理单位从1958年以来提出大小革新建议共达一千一百项，提高生产率10％—6000％，为国家节约了三十多万越元。
