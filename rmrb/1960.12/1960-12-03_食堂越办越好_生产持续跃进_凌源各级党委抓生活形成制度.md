Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 1st: Lingyuan County, Liaoning Province, has recently implemented the "Secretary's Livelihood Work Day" and a system of cadres taking turns residing in the dining halls, making it a regular and institutionalized practice for the whole Party to focus on people's livelihood, and the dining halls are getting better and better. For several years, the vast majority of cadres in Lingyuan County have basically managed to grasp both production and people's livelihood in their work. However, some cadres only made general appeals to focus on people's livelihood, and did relatively little concrete work and problem-solving.

In order to further improve the lives of commune members with the dining hall as the center and promote the continued leap forward in production, the Lingyuan County Party Committee proposed the call for "four-level secretaries to go to the kitchen, and four heads to reside in the dining hall," and determined that cadres at the county, commune, brigade, and team levels, led by the secretary, should spend an appropriate amount of time delving into the forefront of people's livelihood while going deep into the forefront of production. County-level cadres should spend three to four days focusing on people's livelihood during the ten days they spend in the countryside every half-month; commune-level cadres should spend two to three days focusing on people's livelihood during the seven days they work at the grassroots level every ten days; brigade cadres and team cadres should take turns serving as dining hall managers and cooks to effectively focus on people's livelihood. After cadres go to the dining hall, they should not only work and prepare meals together with the cooks and managers, but also conscientiously implement the Party's various policies on running dining halls well, mobilize the masses to participate in the democratic management of the dining halls, strengthen ideological education for the cooks and managers, adhere to the implementation of planned grain use and economical grain use, and ensure that commune members eat well and save money. Since implementing the "Secretary's Livelihood Work Day" and the system of cadres taking turns residing in the dining halls, more than 3,500 cadres in the county have frequently gone deep into the forefront of people's livelihood, making the dining halls better and better. Qin Youren, the first secretary of the County Party Committee, recently went deep into the second dining hall of the Songzhangzi team in the Songzhangzi commune, helped the dining hall hand over its assets to the commune members, organized the commune members to offer suggestions, and finally made a year-round grain use plan based on the busy and slack farming seasons, the lightness and heaviness of the work, and the size of the personnel, which was widely welcomed by the masses. Since the Beiyingzi commune implemented the "Secretary's Livelihood Work Day" and the system of cadres taking turns residing in the dining halls, the number of first-class dining halls has increased from the original 31 to 35, basically eliminating third-class dining halls. All dining halls have managed to keep the kang warm, the rooms warm, the food diverse, and the eating good while saving money. (Attached picture)

    食堂越办越好　生产持续跃进
    凌源各级党委抓生活形成制度
    新华社沈阳1日电　辽宁省凌源县各级党委最近普遍推行了“书记生活工作日”和干部轮流驻食堂制度，使全党抓生活经常化和制度化，食堂越办越好。凌源县绝大多数干部几年来在工作中基本上做到了一手抓生产、一手抓生活。但是也有一些干部对抓生活只是一般号召，具体做工作和解决问题比较少。
  中共凌源县委为了进一步以食堂为中心搞好社员生活，促进生产持续跃进，提出
  “四级书记下伙房，四长驻食堂”的号召，确定县、公社、大队、小队四级干部，以书记为首在深入生产第一线时，都要以适当的时间深入生活第一线。县级干部每半个月下乡十天中要有三天到四天抓生活；公社干部每旬在基层工作的七天时间中要有两天到三天抓生活；大队干部和小队干部要轮流到食堂当管理员和炊事员，切实抓好生活。干部到食堂后，不但要和炊事员、管理员一起劳动，一起办伙食，还要认真贯彻执行党的关于办好食堂的各项政策，发动群众参加食堂的民主管理，加强对炊事员和管理员的思想教育，坚持实行计划用粮、节约用粮，保证社员吃得好又吃得省。推行“书记生活工作日”和干部轮流驻食堂制以后，全县三千五百多名干部都经常深入生活第一线，使食堂越办越好。县委第一书记秦友仁，最近深入宋杖子公社宋杖子小队第二食堂，帮助食堂把家底交给社员，组织社员出谋献计，最后根据农活忙闲、活计轻重、人员大小，分类分月地做出了全年用粮计划，受到群众的普遍欢迎。北营子公社从推行“书记生活工作日”和干部轮流驻食堂以后，一类食堂由原来三十一个增加到三十五个，基本上消灭了三类食堂。所有的食堂都做到了炕热屋子暖，饭菜多样化，吃得好又吃得省。（附图片）
