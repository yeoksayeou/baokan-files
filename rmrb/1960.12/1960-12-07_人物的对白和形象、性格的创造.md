    Literary works have always been called "the art of language" in literary terminology. From a formal point of view, this definition is reasonable. Without language, literary works would not have their own form of expression. However, I think that drama and film, based on literary scripts, are also largely a kind of language art. Naturally, the language of literary works and the language of drama and film have different effects and their own characteristics.

    For example, character dialogue in dramatic and film arts (excluding literary scripts) is probably the only existing form of language. However, it is not easy to make character dialogue truly show the characteristics of language art and have the function of creating images and creating personalities. I have seen some plays and films, and some of the dialogues (especially in plays, where dialogue is one of the main means of shaping characters) lack artistic features and do not necessarily have a good effect on shaping images and personalities. These dialogues do not vividly express personality or the thoughts and feelings of the characters, but are used by the author to explain personality or the thoughts and feelings of the characters. This cannot but weaken the role of dialogue as an artistic means, because on the stage and screen, people want to see the images and personalities of people in action. Dialogue here cannot be separated from the direct expression of images and personalities. Outstanding artists are good at grasping the characteristics of various art forms and using character dialogue in combination with the needs of the image and personality in action, using concise and accurate dialogue to express the characters' distinct thoughts and feelings. Many of the works of playwright Cao Yu have remarkable features in this respect. His famous work "Thunderstorm" is an example. Everyone knows that the relationship between the characters in "Thunderstorm" is very complex. Each of them has their own personality development history. When these characters with complex relationships gather on the same scene, if an artist lacking cultivation is allowed to handle it, it will inevitably require a large amount of dialogue to explain their thoughts and feelings, and the result will not be very good in shaping images and personalities. Cao Yu is different. He uses very concise dialogue, combined with the creation of stage images, to deeply portray the characters' personalities. For example, the scene of the dialogue between Lu Ma and Zhou Puyuan in the second act is a brilliant dialogue in "Thunderstorm". How concise is that dialogue! Here, there is absolutely no redundant language, even the narration of events (like Lu Ma narrating her experiences in the past thirty years) is so closely combined with the portrayal of the character's personality. Often a few lines of dialogue can prominently express the distinct characteristics of the character's personality. This dialogue not only expresses the complex emotions but also the stubborn personality of Lu Ma, but also deeply exposes the hypocritical spirit of Zhou Puyuan.

    Outstanding artists always make the dialogue of characters show the characteristics of language art. To achieve this, one must be good at combining the creation of images and personalities, and strictly select personalized language that can reveal typical character in the dialogue of characters. Recently, I had the opportunity to re-watch the films "Dong Cunrui" and "Youth in the Flames of War." Of course, the artistic achievements of these two excellent films are multifaceted, but I think their achievements in this area are also very prominent.

    Like "Dong Cunrui," in order to depict the image of this young hero in many ways, the selection of dialogue that can vividly reflect the character's thoughts and feelings can be said to have played a major artistic role in portraying the character's development of Dong Cunrui. Several scenes of Dong Cunrui and Zhi Zhenbiao requesting to join the army (first requesting from Wang Ping and Zhao Lianchang, and then requesting from the instructor), the dialogue is not only full of character characteristics, but also full of life atmosphere, and has a touching comedy effect, vividly portraying the lively and vigorous images of two young heroes who grew up under the long-term education of the Party.

    "Youth in the Flames of War" is a different situation. It does not have much character dialogue, but it is all used where it is needed. For example, the scenes when Gao Shan first arrived at Lei Zhenlin's platoon, the several pieces of tit-for-tat dialogue between Gao Shan and Lei Zhenlin, deeply portray the two completely different character personalities. For Gao Shan, some personalized dialogue not only shows her deep personality that has matured in the test of war, but also subtly expresses her delicate emotional characteristics as a woman, although she is dressed as a man.

    In short, in the character dialogue in dramatic and film arts, we must also pay attention to the characteristics of language art, must combine with the need to create images and create typical personalities, and strictly select personalized language, and must not treat character dialogue as the author's explanatory words. Naturally, the selection of dialogue is not an isolated issue. It depends on the depth of the artist's grasp of the character's personality, and also depends on the depth of the artist's understanding of life. The reason why the character dialogues in "Dong Cunrui" and "Youth in the Flames of War" are so full of character, and full of a strong atmosphere of life, is difficult to achieve without the writer's familiarity with life.

    人物的对白和形象、性格的创造
    倪强
    历来在文学术语里，都称文学作品是“语言的艺术”，从形式的角度上来说，这个定义是有道理的，文学作品离开了语言，就没有了自己的表现形式。但是，我觉得那以文学剧本为基础的戏剧和电影，在很大程度上也是一种语言艺术。自然，文学作品的语言和戏剧、电影的语言，有着不同的功效，各有自己的特点。
    譬如人物的对话，在戏剧艺术和电影艺术（除去文学剧本）里，它恐怕是唯一存在的语言形式了，但是，使人物对话真正能显示出语言艺术的特点而又具有创造形象、创造性格的作用，这却是很不容易的。我就看过一些话剧和影片，其中有的对白（特别是话剧，对白是它的塑造人物的主要手段之一），就缺少艺术的特点，对塑造形象、塑造性格，也不一定有好作用。这些对白大都不是形象地表现性格、表现人物思想感情，而是作者用来说明性格、说明人物思想感情的，这就不能不削弱了对白的艺术手段的作用，因为在舞台和银幕上，人们所要看的，是行动着的人的形象和性格，对白在这里不能离开形象、性格的直接表现。杰出的艺术家，都是善于把握各种艺术形式的特点，结合着行动着的形象、性格的需要来运用人物的对白，用精练、准确的对白，来表现人物的鲜明的思想感情。像剧作家曹禺同志的许多作品，在这方面就具有显著的特点。他的名作《雷雨》就是例子。大家都知道，《雷雨》里面人物之间的关系是非常复杂的。他们每个人，都有自己的性格成长史。当这些有着复杂关系的人物聚集在同一场面上的时候，如果让一位缺乏修养的艺术家来处理，那势必需要大段的对白来说明他们的思想感情，而其结果是不会很好地塑造出形象、性格来的。曹禺同志则不然，他是用很简练的对白，结合着舞台形象的创造，深入地刻划了人物的性格。像第二幕鲁妈和周朴园对白的场面，这是《雷雨》里一段精采的对白，那对白是何等精练啊！在这里，绝没有累赘的语言，即使是事件的叙述（像鲁妈叙述别后三十年的遭遇），也都是那样紧密地结合着人物性格的刻划。往往几句对白，就能突出地表现了人物性格的鲜明特点。这段对白就既表现了有着复杂感情却很倔强的鲁妈的性格，又深刻地揭露了周朴园的伪君子的精神面貌。
    出色的艺术家，总是使人物的对白显示出语言艺术的特点的。想做到这一点，就必须善于结合着形象、性格的创造，严格地选择人物对白能够揭示典型性格的个性化的语言。最近有机会重看了《董存瑞》和《战火中的青春》两部影片，当然这两部优秀的影片在艺术创作上的成就是多方面的，但我觉得它们在这方面的成就也是很突出的。
    像《董存瑞》，作者为了多方面地描绘这个青年英雄的形象，那能形象地反映人物思想感情的对白的选择，真可以说是在刻划董存瑞的性格发展上起了主要艺术手段的作用。董存瑞、郅振标要求参军的几个镜头（先是向王平、赵连长要求，后是向指导员要求），那对白既富有性格化的特点，又充满了生活气息，而且有着动人的喜剧效果，活画出两个在党的长期教育下成长起来的英雄少年的生气勃勃的形象。
    《战火中的青春》则是另外一种情形，它的人物对白并不多，但都是用在刀口上的。譬如高山刚到雷振林排里的那些镜头，高山和雷振林的几段针锋相对的对白，是何等深刻地刻划了两个完全不同的人物性格。对于高山来说，有些个性化的对白，不仅显示了她的在战火考验里成熟起来的深沉的性格，而且含蓄地表现了她虽然男装却是女性的细腻的感情特点。
    总之，在戏剧艺术和电影艺术里的人物对白，也必须重视语言艺术的特点，必须结合着创造形象、创造典型性格的需要，严格地选择富有个性化的语言，不能把人物对白当做作家的说明词。自然，对白的选择也并不是一个孤立的问题，它决定于艺术家对于人物性格把握的深度，也同样决定于艺术家对于生活理解的深度，像《董存瑞》和《战火中的青春》的人物对白所以那样富有性格化，富有浓郁的生活气息，离开作家对于生活的熟悉，是很难做到的。
