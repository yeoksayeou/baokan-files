Xinhua News Agency, Havana, December 9th. Cuban Acting Foreign Minister Olivares delivered a diplomatic note to the U.S. Embassy in Cuba on the 8th, strongly protesting the United States' deliberate explosion of a rocket over Cuba.

    The note pointed out that this is another interventionist and aggressive event violating Cuban sovereignty.

    The note listed in detail the various provocative and aggressive actions taken by the U.S. government against Cuba: defamation through a clumsy news propaganda campaign; blatant violation of international agreements and treaties, declaring a series of aggressive measures against Cuba economically, from reducing sugar quotas, freezing bank accounts, and detaining aircraft of (Cuban) national companies, to economic blockade and coercion of other countries to take similar measures; brazenly and continuously invading Cuban territory and instigating armed aggression, using war criminals and traitors living in the United States for this purpose, allocating more than one million U.S. dollars in loans to be used as military training expenses for these people. The note condemned the recent violation of Cuban territorial waters by a U.S. warship, unloading a group of mercenaries, including several Americans, on the coast of Oriente Province, and the continuous violation of Cuban airspace by U.S. aircraft, setting fire to sugarcane fields and bombing Cuban towns.

    The note emphasized that the series of aggressive activities carried out by the U.S. government targeting the Cuban people and the official statement that "the rocket was deliberately exploded" clearly affirm that this incident is part of a "huge conspiracy planned in the United States against this small but noble country, under the encouragement and funding of the U.S. government."

    The note refuted the U.S. official sophistry that the rocket explosion was due to an "irreparable malfunction in its operation," saying that this is hardly credible: "Launching an unsecured device into the air, while absolutely ignoring the lives and interests of citizens throughout our continent, arbitrarily determining its direction."

    古巴政府就美国在古巴上空爆炸火箭事件发出照会
    痛斥美国侵犯古巴主权的挑衅行动
    新华社哈瓦那9日电　古巴代理外长奥利瓦雷斯8日交给美国驻古巴大使馆一份外交照会，强烈抗议美国故意在古巴上空爆炸一枚火箭。
    照会指出，这是侵犯古巴主权的又一个干涉性和侵略性的事件。
    照会详尽地列举了美国政府对古巴采取各种挑衅和侵略的行动。通过拙劣的新闻宣传运动进行诽谤；肆无忌惮地违反国际协定和条约，在经济上对古巴宣布了一连串的侵略措施，从降低糖的定额，冻结银行账目以及扣留（古巴）国家公司的飞机，直到经济封锁和胁迫其他国家采取类似的措施；放肆地不断侵犯古巴的领土和策动武装侵略，为此而利用住在美国的战争罪犯和叛徒，拨出一百多万美元的贷款用来作为这些人进行军事训练的费用。照会谴责最近美国的一艘军舰侵犯古巴领海，在奥连特省的海岸卸下了一批雇佣军，其中有几个人是美国人，美国的飞机不断地侵犯古巴的领空，纵火焚烧甘蔗田和轰炸古巴的城镇。
    照会强调指出，美国政府以古巴人民为目标所进行的一系列的侵略活动以及关于“火箭是故意爆炸的”正式声明使人们清楚地肯定，这个事件是在美国政府的“鼓励和资助下，在美国策划的反对这个小小的，但却崇高的国家的巨大阴谋的组成部分。”
    照会驳斥了美国官方关于火箭爆炸是由于它的“运转发生无法挽救的故障”的诡辩，照会说，这是难以令人置信的：“向空中发射不能保险的装置，却绝对忽视我们整个大陆的公民的生命和利益，随意地确定它的方向。”
