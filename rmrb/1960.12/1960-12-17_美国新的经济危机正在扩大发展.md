Industrial production level down 6% from January; Operating rate of entire manufacturing industry less than 80%; Unemployment rises to 4.2 million; Business inventories increase to $93.2 billion; National public and private debt reaches unprecedented peak of approximately $900 billion. The crisis of overproduction is intertwined with the international payments crisis. The government's "anti-crisis" measures cannot prevent further deterioration of the crisis. The "American Institute for Economic Research" admits that this crisis is "serious and persistent."

Less than two years after the 1957-1958 economic crisis, the United States has experienced a new economic crisis, which is currently deepening.

All indications show that the U.S. economy entered the initial stage of the crisis in February of this year. The situation deteriorated further after August, and the symptoms of the economic crisis have become apparent in many ways.

U.S. industrial production, especially the production of important industrial sectors, continues to decline. In January of this year, the U.S. industrial production index was 111 (with the 1957 average as 100), the highest point since the 1957-1958 economic crisis. Industrial production began to contract in February. From February to July, the production index hovered between 109 and 110, falling to 108 in August and 107 in September and October. According to a recent report in "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, industrial production continued to shrink in November. In the two weeks from November 6 to 19, the level of industrial production fell by another 1% compared to October, and 6% compared to the peak in January.

The largest production cuts were in the so-called durable goods industries, especially the steel, automobile, and construction industries, which are of great significance to the U.S. economy. From January to September, durable goods production fell by more than 8%. The operating rate of the steel industry has remained only slightly above 50% since the summer of this year, similar to the most severe period of the 1958 economic crisis, and in mid-November it fell again to 47.5%. U.S. steel industry insiders estimate that December production will definitely be lower than November, and according to the new order volume, operating at only 40% capacity will be sufficient. Automobile production in September this year fell by 40% compared to January. Although production increased in October due to automobile companies producing 1961 models in advance, it declined again in November. Currently, unsold automobiles amount to as many as 1.1 million vehicles. The situation in the construction industry is also bad. The value of public and private construction in the first three quarters of this year decreased by 3% compared to the same period last year. The estimated value of new construction in November decreased by 5% compared to October, and October had already decreased compared to September. Since August, the crisis has expanded to most industrial sectors, and the operating rate of the entire manufacturing industry has recently fallen below 80%.

The serious unemployment problem has remained a chronic disease of the U.S. economy since the last economic crisis. In the so-called "prosperous" year of 1959, the annual average number of unemployed, according to official statistics, was 3.8 million. It had decreased slightly at one point this summer, but was still about one million more than the level before the outbreak of the last crisis. Then, with the shrinking of production, the number of unemployed quickly surged again. In October, it rebounded to 3.58 million, and in mid-November it surged again to 4.2 million, not far from the level of the last economic crisis. Even the U.S. official believes that it will rise to more than 5.2 million by the beginning of next year. According to a survey by the U.S. Department of Labor, in 150 major industrial centers, there were 51 severely unemployed areas (i.e., areas with an unemployment rate of more than 6%) in November this year, while there were only 21 in May 1957 (the initial stage of the last crisis).

Long-term mass unemployment coupled with the continuous rise in people's living expenses cannot but seriously reduce the actual income and purchasing power of the American working people. Factors that seriously reduce people's purchasing power also include: the further decline in farmers' income and the sharp increase in American people's debt. The continued development of the agricultural crisis that has lasted for many years has caused the prices of agricultural products in the first three quarters of this year to fall further compared to last year. And U.S. consumer credit and mortgage loans have recently risen to $196 billion, an increase of $71.3 billion from last year. Now many families have to pay 25% of their monthly after-tax income to pay off overdue debts and interest. In this case, the contradiction between the blind expansion of U.S. industrial production capacity and the shrinking purchasing power of the people is further intensified. In October of this year, U.S. retail sales of consumer goods decreased by 4% compared to April, with durable consumer goods falling even more, reaching 8%. Business inventories rose to more than $91.4 billion in February of this year, which is higher than the peak of $91.3 billion during the 1957-1958 crisis. By the beginning of October, business inventories had increased to $93.2 billion. And new orders received by American factories in October decreased by $1.1 billion compared to September. Sales also fell by $700 million this month.

In a situation of serious overcapacity in production equipment and difficulty in selling products, U.S. business capitalists are currently unwilling to invest heavily in domestic fixed capital. After the last economic crisis, U.S. business investment has never recovered to the level before the crisis. This year, the original investment was $37 billion, which is actually still lower than the level of 1957. Now it is reported that only $36 billion can be invested. Despite the U.S. government's repeated reduction of loan interest rates, American entrepreneurs, lacking confidence in the future, are still hesitant to borrow money to expand their businesses. Since the middle of this year, the number of corporate borrowings has actually decreased by 210 million yuan. American bourgeois economists estimate that fixed capital investment will also decline significantly by the beginning of next year.

In addition, railway freight volume has been lower than the level of 1957 every week recently; wholesale prices are falling; stock market operations have experienced sharp declines; domestic profits have declined; and the number of bankruptcies of small and medium-sized enterprises has risen to an unprecedented peak after the war. All these indicate that the storm of a new economic crisis is violently shaking the United States.

The U.S. government this time took so-called "anti-crisis" measures particularly early, trying to prevent the development of the crisis. The Republican government, worried about its disadvantage in the election, did not wait for the crisis to develop seriously as in the past, but took measures to increase government spending (especially military spending), relax credit, and expand exports in the early stages of the crisis. But this series of measures failed to prevent further deterioration of the crisis. Nevertheless, the U.S. ruling group is still trying to ease the crisis by stepping up arms expansion and war preparations. The U.S. government has decided to increase military orders by $2 billion. President-elect Kennedy has repeatedly advocated greatly expanding military spending and other government expenditures.

The current economic crisis in the United States occurred shortly after the 1957-1958 crisis. This once again proves that economic crises in the United States are becoming more and more frequent and the cycles are getting shorter and shorter after the war. The full consequences of the last economic crisis had not been overcome before the new economic crisis occurred, as evidenced by the situation in the United States regarding unemployment and business investment after 1958. Before this crisis, the degree of overcapacity in U.S. production equipment was more serious than before previous crises after the war. In the so-called "prosperous" year of 1959, the average operating rate of the entire manufacturing industry was only 85%, and the machinery industry was 76%. The severity of overcapacity is also reflected in the fact that although monopoly capitalists are still constantly raising prices for people's daily consumer goods, monopoly capital has recently been forced to lower prices for many durable goods. The appearance of this phenomenon before the crisis has developed to its lowest point is rare in previous U.S. economic crises after the war.

Another characteristic of this economic crisis is that the crisis of overproduction is intertwined with the deterioration of the financial situation, especially the serious foreign payment crisis. In recent months, the U.S. foreign payment situation has fallen into an unprecedented crisis after the war, and gold reserves have rapidly fallen below the "danger point" of $18 billion, and the credibility of the U.S. dollar is shaking violently. As British newspapers have pointed out, this puts the U.S. ruling group in "between two fires"—trying to give production a boost will make the international payments crisis even worse; and easing the international payments crisis will make the domestic production decline even more severely. This situation cannot but aggravate the severity of the economic crisis. U.S. public and private debt this year reached an unprecedented peak of approximately $900 billion, equivalent to 180% of the U.S.'s annual gross national product. Some U.S. newspapers and periodicals are raising the question: can the U.S. economy in a "recession" afford such a debt "pyramid"? The ongoing agricultural crisis that has lasted for many years is now more serious than during the last economic crisis. Farmers' net income in 1959 decreased by 17% compared to the previous year. The further decline in agricultural product prices is estimated to reduce the income of American farmers this year by another 3% compared to last year, and the number of farmer bankruptcies and escapes is increasing. This further weakens the U.S. domestic market and makes the crisis more dangerous.

A recent analysis by the private institution "American Institute for Economic Research" published in "The Wall Street Journal" worriedly believes that this U.S. economic crisis is "not only cyclical" but also "serious and persistent." (Xinhua News Agency)

### 美国新的经济危机正在扩大发展

    美国新的经济危机正在扩大发展
    工业生产水平比1月份下降6％；整个制造业的开工率不到80％；失业人数增加到420万人；企业存货增加到932亿美元；全国公私债务达到约9000亿美元的空前最高峰。生产过剩的危机已同国际支付危机交织在一起。政府的“反危机”措施并不能阻止危机的进一步恶化。“美国经济研究所”承认，这次危机是“严重和持久”的。
    1957—1958年的经济危机刚过去还不到两年，美国又爆发了一场新的经济危机，而且目前正在深入发展。
    各方面的情况表明，从今年2月以来，美国经济就进入了危机的初期阶段。8月以后情况进一步恶化，经济危机的症状已经在许多方面明显地发作出来。
    美国工业生产，特别是各重要工业部门的生产，不断下降。今年1月美国工业生产指数是一百一十一（以1957年平均数为一百），这是1957—1958年经济危机以后的最高点。从2月开始工业生产即开始萎缩起来。从2月到7月生产指数一直盘旋在一百零九和一百一十之间，8月下降到一百零八，9月和10月下降到一百零七。据《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志最近报道，11月份工业生产继续减缩，在11月6日到19日的两周内工业生产水平已经比10月份又下跌了1％，比1月份的高峰则下跌了6％。
    工业生产中减产最多的是所谓耐用品工业，特别是对美国经济有重要意义的钢铁、汽车和建筑业。从1月到9月，耐用品生产共下降了8％以上。钢铁工业的开工率在今年夏季以后一直只比50％稍高一些，同1958年经济危机最严重时期相仿佛，而在11月中旬又下降到47.5％。美国钢铁业人士估计，12月份产量肯定比11月份还要低，按照新的订货数量，只要开工40％就够了。小汽车生产今年9月的产量比1月份下降了40％，10月份产量虽然由于汽车公司提前生产1961年式汽车而有所增加，但是到11月又再度下降，目前卖不出去的汽车高达一百一十万辆。建筑业的情况也同样坏，今年头三季公私建筑价值比去年同期下降了3％。11月份的新建筑价值估计比10月份下降5％，而10月份已经比9月份减少了。8月份以来危机已扩大到大多数工业部门，整个制造业的开工率近来已下降到80％以下。
    严重的失业问题在上一次经济危机过去以后依然是美国经济的痼疾。在所谓“繁荣”的1959年，全年平均失业人数按官方统计是三百八十万。今年夏季曾一度稍稍减少，但是仍然比上次危机爆发前的水平多一百万人左右。接着，随着生产的萎缩，失业人数很快又重新猛增了。10月份回升到三百五十八万人，到11月中旬再猛升到四百二十万人，同上一次经济危机时的水平相差不远。甚至美国官方都认为，明年年初要上升到五百二十万人以上。据美国劳工部调查，在一百五十个主要工业中心里，今年11月已有五十一个严重失业地区（即失业百分比在6％以上的地区），而1957年5月（上次危机的初期阶段）只有二十一个。
    长期的大量失业加上人民生活费用的不断上涨，不能不使美国劳动人民的实际收入和购买力严重缩减。使得人民购买力严重缩减的因素还有：农民收入的进一步下降和美国人民债务的剧增。延续多年的农业危机的继续发展，使得今年头三季的农产品价格比去年的水平又进一步下降。而美国的消费信贷和抵押贷款最近已上升到一千九百六十亿美元，比去年增加了七百一十三亿美元。现在许多家庭不得不把每月纳税后的收入的25％来支付到期的债务本息。在这种情况下，美国工业生产能力的盲目扩张同人民购买力日益缩减之间的矛盾更加剧了。今年10月份，美国消费品零售额比4月份减少了4％，其中耐用消费品下降更多，达到8％。企业存货在今年2月已上升到九百一十四亿美元以上，即高于1957—1958年危机时的最高点九百一十三亿美元。到10月初企业存货又增加到九百三十二亿美元。而美国工厂收到的新订货单10月份又比9月份减少了十一亿美元。这一月销售额也下降了七亿美元。
    在生产设备能力严重过剩、产品销售困难的情况下，美国的企业资本家们目前不愿在国内固定资本方面大量投资。在上一次经济危机过去以后，美国企业投资本来就一直没有恢复危机以前的水平。今年原订投资三百七十亿美元，这实际上仍然低于1957年的水平。现在据报道，只能投资三百六十亿美元了。尽管美国政府一再降低贷款利率，对前途缺乏信心的美国企业家对于借款扩充营业仍裹足不前。今年年中以来，企业借款数目反而下降了二亿一千万元。美国资产阶级经济学家估计，固定资本投资到明年初还将大大下降。
    此外，铁路货运量近来每周都低于1957年的水平；批发物价在下跌；股票行市经营发生剧烈下跌；国内利润下降；而中小企业的破产数目则上升到战后空前的最高峰，这些都标志着新的经济危机的风暴已在猛烈震撼着美国。
    美国政府这一次曾经特别提前采取了所谓“反危机”措施，力图阻止危机的发展。担心对自己在大选中不利的共和党政府，没有像过去那样到危机发展得严重时，而是在危机的初期就采取了增加政府开支（特别是军事开支）、放宽信贷和扩大出口等措施。但是这一系列措施却没有能够阻止危机的进一步恶化。尽管如此，美国统治集团仍然妄图用加紧扩军备战来缓和危机。美国政府已决定增加军事订货二十亿美元。当选总统肯尼迪更是一再鼓吹大大扩大军事开支和其他政府支出。
    美国当前这一次经济危机是在1957—1958年的危机刚过去不久的情况下发生的。这再一次证明了战后美国经济危机愈来愈频繁，周期愈来愈短。上一次经济危机的全部后果在新的经济危机发生前还没有克服，1958年以后美国失业和企业投资等方面的情况都说明了这一点。这次危机前美国生产设备能力的过剩程度比战后历次危机前更严重。在所谓“繁荣”的1959年，整个制造业的平均开工率只有85％，机器工业是76％。生产能力过剩的严重性还反映在这样的事实上：尽管垄断资本家在人民日常生活消费品方面还在不断抬高价格，但在不少耐用品方面垄断资本最近已被迫降低售价。危机还没有发展到最低点就出现这种现象，这在战后美国历次经济危机中是罕见的。
    这次经济危机的另一个特点是生产过剩危机同财政金融情况的恶化、特别是严重的对外支付危机交织在一起。近几月来，美国的对外支付情况已经陷入了战后空前未有的危机，黄金储备迅速下降到“危险点”一百八十亿美元以下，美元的信用正在剧烈动摇。这种情况正如英国报纸所指出的，使美国统治集团处于“两个火坑之间”——要设法给生产打强心针，就会使国际支付危机更加恶化；而要缓和国际支付危机，又会使国内生产下降更严重。这种形势不能不加重经济危机的严重性。美国的公私债务今年达到了约九千亿美元的空前未有的最高峰，相当于美国全年的国民生产总值的180％。美国一些报刊正在提出这样的问题：对于这样一个债务的“金字塔”，“衰退中”的美国经济是否能够承担得了。延续多年的经常性的农业危机现在比上次经济危机时期更加严重。1959年农民净收入就比前一年下降了17％。农产品价格的进一步下降估计将使今年美国农民的收入比去年再减少3％，农民破产逃亡数目越来越多。这就进一步削弱了美国的国内市场，使危机更加险恶。
    《华尔街日报》不久前刊载的私人机构“美国经济研究所”的一个分析忧虑地认为，美国这场经济危机“不但是周期性的”，而且还将“严重和持久”。　（新华社）
