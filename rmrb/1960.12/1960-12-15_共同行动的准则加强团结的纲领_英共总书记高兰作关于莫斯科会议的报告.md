Xinhua News Agency, London, December 12th: The "Daily Worker" here reported today that the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, John Gollan, reported to the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain last weekend on the Moscow meeting of eighty-one communist and workers' parties. After discussing the report, the Executive Committee endorsed the declaration of the Moscow meeting.

Gollan first emphasized the great significance of Sino-Soviet unity. He said that Sino-Soviet unity is essential in the struggle for peace. This unity was affirmed at the Moscow meeting.

Gollan said that the main characteristic of our era is that the world socialist system is becoming the decisive factor in social development. The world capitalist system is in a process of profound decline and disintegration. Within the world capitalist system, the strengthening of monopolies increases its internal contradictions. The ruling forces in many capitalist countries are no longer able to cope alone with the growing democratic and progressive forces.

He pointed out that the growing strength of socialist countries, the tremendous new upsurge of national liberation struggles, and the development of the working class and general democratic movements in capitalist countries, all these great forces are converging into a powerful torrent that is destroying and smashing the imperialist system.

Gollan said, "At the Moscow meeting, it was unanimously agreed that peace is the urgent issue of our time, and the U.S. is the main force of aggression and war. Although the aggressive nature of imperialism has not changed, the real forces that have emerged are able to frustrate its aggressive plans. War is not inevitably unavoidable." He said that the moment has now arrived when the activities of all existing forces for peace can stop the imperialist aggressors from launching a world war.

The "Daily Worker" published an editorial on December 6 entitled "Guarantee of Victory" on the declaration of the conference of representatives of communist and workers' parties.

Fajon emphasized that the meeting declaration is "an extremely important document." He said, "The declaration provides a vivid and complete account of the current world situation, the powerful forces that determine the overall development of the current world situation, and the broad prospects for struggle and victory facing the working class and the entire democratic and national forces in every country and on a world scale."

Fajon then briefly discussed the contents of the declaration. In reviewing the last chapter of the declaration, Fajon pointed out that this chapter "disappoints our enemies the most," "because this chapter is precisely about the unity of the communist movement."

Fajon concluded by saying, "This historic meeting that has just concluded is not just for communists. Beyond our ranks, its far-reaching brilliance will guide all workers and all those harmed by monopoly capitalist groups who are struggling for peace and democracy on the road to the victory of socialism."

Human Hope: Abstract of Editorial from the Danish Communist Party's "Land og Folk"
Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 12th: Copenhagen News: The Danish Communist Party newspaper "Land og Folk" published an editorial on December 7 on the conference of representatives of communist and workers' parties, entitled "Human Hope."

The editorial said that communists all over the world will proudly see how their united political force is constantly changing the course of the world. The editorial said that our goal is to create a peaceful world without capitalist exploitation, and this goal is precisely the hope of all mankind. It will be realized on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and on the basis of proletarian internationalism.

The editorial pointed out that the declaration of the conference of communist and workers' parties states that the combined efforts of the world socialist camp, the international working class, the national liberation movement, all countries opposed to war, and all peace-loving forces can stop a world war.

The editorial emphasized that the joint action taken by the working people of capitalist countries in opposing the rule of monopoly capital occupies an important position in the struggle for peace. The struggle for democratic reforms unfolded under the capitalist social system guarantees that the people will exert greater influence in favor of peace and their living conditions. At the same time, the people will realize that only through socialist transformation can they create a happy future for themselves.

The editorial emphasized that the Moscow meeting of eighty-one communist parties marks the unbreakable unity of the most influential political force of our time—the international communist movement. The editorial pointed out that it repelled the attacks of all enemies of the workers' movement, both inside and outside, and shattered the capitalist forces and their running dogs, the revisionists, who constantly attempted to create contradictions between the Soviet Union and China. Those who dream of finding cracks among the thirty-six million communists will surely suffer the consequences.”

The editorial said that the declaration resolutely condemns the activities of the revisionists, who are "exerting themselves to undermine the unity of all peace-loving forces and countries under the pretext of non-alignment policy."

The editorial said, "Our peace-loving people are now constantly threatened, provoked, and attacked by U.S. imperialism and the counter-revolutionaries and traitors who unconditionally serve it, who dream of restoring the evil semi-colonial rule and regaining the privileges that have been forever deprived by the revolution." "Therefore, while defending peace, our people are arming, organizing, training, and preparing to defeat the attacks and aggression of the imperialists and counter-revolutionaries, and to deliver a severe and decisive blow to all those who attack the revolution, attack the people, and attack our homeland."

    共同行动的准则加强团结的纲领
    英共总书记高兰作关于莫斯科会议的报告
    据新华社伦敦12日电　这里的《工人日报》今天报道，英国共产党总书记约翰·高兰在上周末向英共执行委员会作了关于八十一个共产党和工人党莫斯科会议的报告。执行委员会在讨论了这一报告后，赞同这次莫斯科会议的声明。
    高兰首先强调指出苏中团结的重大意义。他说，苏中团结在争取和平的斗争中是必不可少的。这种团结在莫斯科会议上得到了肯定。
    高兰说，我们时代的主要特征，是世界社会主义体系正在成为社会发展的决定因素。世界资本主义体系正处在一个深刻的衰落和瓦解的过程中，在世界资本主义体系中，垄断的加强增加了它的内部矛盾。许多资本主义国家中的统治力量再也无力单独对付日益增长的民主和进步力量。
    他指出，社会主义国家的力量日益强大，民族解放斗争的巨大的新高涨，资本主义国家中工人阶级和一般民主运动的发展，所有这些伟大的力量正在汇合成一股破坏和摧毁帝国主义制度的强大洪流。
    高兰说，“在莫斯科会议上，已一致认为，和平是我们时代的迫切问题，美国是侵略和战争的主要力量。虽然帝国主义的侵略本性没有改变，但是已经出现的现实力量能够挫败它的侵略计划。战争不是注定不可避免的。”他说，现在，一切现有和平力量的活动可以制止住帝国主义侵略者发动一场世界大战的企图的时刻已经到来了。
    《工人日报》12月6日以《胜利的保证》为题就各国共产党和工人党代表会议声明发表了社论。

    法戎接着概括地谈到了声明的内容。法戎在评介声明的最后一章时指出，这一章“使我们的敌人最感失望”，“因为这一章恰恰是谈的共产主义运动的团结一致”。
    法戎最后说，“刚刚开过的这次历史性的会议不是仅仅为了共产党人。在我们的行列之外，它的影响的深远的光辉，将在走向社会主义的胜利的道路上，指引全体劳动者，指引为争取和平与民主而斗争的一切受垄断资本集团之害的人们”。
    人类的希望  丹共《国土与人民报》社论摘要
    据新华社柏林12日电　哥本哈根消息：丹麦共产党机关报《国土与人民报》7日就各国共产党和工人党代表会议发表社论，题目是《人类的希望》。
    社论说，全世界共产党人将骄傲地看到，他们这股统一的政治力量如何不断改变着世界的进程。社论说，我们的目标是要创建一个和平的并且没有资本主义剥削的世界，这个目标正是全人类的希望。它将在马克思列宁主义的基础上，在无产阶级国际主义的基础上来加以实现。
    社论指出，在各国共产党和工人党会议声明中说，世界社会主义阵营、国际工人阶级、民族解放运动、所有反对战争的国家以及一切爱好和平力量的联合努力能够制止世界大战。
    社论强调说，资本主义各国劳动人民在反对垄断资本统治时采取联合行动，这在争取和平的斗争中占据着重要的地位。在资本主义社会制度下展开争取民主改革的斗争，保证了人民在有利于和平和他们的生活条件的方面发挥更大的影响。同时，人民也会体会到只有通过社会主义变革才能为他们自己创建一个幸福的未来。
    社论强调说，八十一个共产党在莫斯科的会议标志着当代最富有影响的政治力量——国际共产主义运动的牢不可破的团结。社论指出，它击退了工人运动一切内外敌人的进攻，粉碎了资本主义势力及其走狗修正主义分子不断企图制造苏中之间的矛盾的阴谋。那些妄想在三千六百万共产党人中间寻找裂痕的人必将自食苦果。”
    八十一个党的声明全世界人民光辉的指南
    古巴《今日报》社论摘要
    据新华社哈瓦那12日电　古巴人民社会党（共产党）机关报《今日报》昨天以《八十一个党的声明，全世界人民光辉的指南》为题发表社论，号召全体古巴人民和革命者阅读和学习这个声明。社论说，古巴人民将从这个声明中“读到对现时代一切主要问题的分析，从中可以得到对我们当前保卫祖国和保卫革命斗争有巨大价值的教益”。
    社论强调指出，这个时代是“昨天还遭受殖民主义和半殖民主义压迫的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民进入世界历史舞台的时代。”
    社论说，声明坚决谴责修正主义者的活动，修正主义者“在非集团政策的借口下竭力破坏一切爱好和平的力量和国家的团结的活动”。
    社论说，“爱好和平的我国人民现在不断受到美帝国主义和无条件地为它效劳的反革命分子和叛徒的威胁、挑衅和攻击，他们幻想使万恶的半殖民统治复辟，重新获得被革命永远剥夺了的特权。”“因此，我国人民在保卫和平的同时正在进行武装、组织起来、进行训练和准备，以便击溃帝国主义者和反革命分子的进攻和侵略，对一切进攻革命、进攻人民和我们祖国的人们给以狠狠的决定性的打击。”
