Xinhua News Agency, Stanleyville, 25th -- Manzikala, the Deputy Governor of Orientale Province in the Congo, announced that Orientale Province will fight with all its strength against any invasion of the province.

Manzikala made these remarks when talking to reporters about the current situation in the Congo. As everyone knows, ever since the US and other imperialists instigated the Mobutu traitorous clique to kidnap Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba by force, and especially since the legitimate government of the Congo announced its temporary relocation to Stanleyville in Orientale Province, the imperialists have been plotting and instructing the Mobutu traitorous clique to collude with the Kalonji traitorous clique in Kasai Province and the Tshombe traitorous clique in Katanga Province, preparing to invade Orientale Province together.

    据新华社25日讯　斯坦利维尔消息：刚果东方省副省长曼齐卡拉宣布，东方省将全力抗击对这个省的任何侵犯。
    曼齐卡拉是在向新闻记者谈到刚果目前的局势时说这番话的。大家知道，自从美国等帝国主义唆使蒙博托叛国集团武装绑架刚果总理卢蒙巴，特别是刚果合法政府宣布暂时迁往东方省斯坦利维尔以后，帝国主义就在策划和指使蒙博托叛国集团，勾结开赛省卡隆吉叛国集团和加丹加省冲伯叛国集团，准备一起进犯东方省。
