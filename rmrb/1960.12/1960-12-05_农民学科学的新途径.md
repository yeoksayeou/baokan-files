New Ways for Peasants to Learn Science
Kang Di

Rapidly improving the scientific and technological level of peasants is a major issue on the cultural and production fronts. China's agriculture has a long history, and the peasant masses have accumulated extremely rich experience in long-term production practices. In the eleven years since liberation, especially under the glorious illumination of the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, many advanced experiences have been created. This is not only of great significance for improving agricultural production, but also raises many new issues worthy of study for the development of scientific theory. Although peasants have gained a lot of experience in production practice, they are limited by their cultural and scientific level and cannot use scientific knowledge and methods to summarize it and elevate it to theoretical principles, and of course, they cannot use it to universally guide agricultural production. At the same time, due to the rapid development of agricultural modernization, agriculture urgently needs to be armed with modern science and technology, but peasants are also greatly restricted in this respect, making it difficult to use modern science and technology to guide the further development of agricultural production. On the one hand, they cannot elevate practice to theory, and on the other hand, they cannot use theory to guide practice and develop practice; this is the fundamental reason why peasants are urgently demanding to learn science and technology.

Once theory is grasped by the masses, it immediately becomes a material force. Once millions of peasants master agricultural scientific theories and technologies, they will certainly unleash endless material forces on the production front and develop China's agricultural production at high speed. Therefore, peasants learning science has become an important strategic task on the cultural and production fronts.

In February of this year, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party approved Wang Baojing, a national agricultural labor model, to study agricultural science and technology at Northwest Agricultural College for one year, and the Fenghuo People's Commune sent eight young peasants to study with Wang Baojing. The situation of these nine people can be basically divided into three types: Wang Baojing represents excellent model figures with high political consciousness, low educational level, strong comprehension ability, and rich production experience; Zhang Wenxin and others represent simple and honest peasants with low cultural level, poor comprehension ability, and several years of farming experience; Wei Zhongwen and others represent rural youths with junior high school education who often participate in agricultural production labor. Obviously, these three types of people have different social experiences and vastly different levels, which will encounter some difficulties in teaching; if some experience can be gained, it will have general significance.

From February 8th, after one hundred and twenty days, they completed five basic courses: mathematics (including arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry), inorganic and analytical chemistry, organic chemistry, physics, and botany. From September 1st, they began to study professional basic courses such as plant physiology, microbiology, plant pathology, and agricultural entomology. In the study of the five basic courses, except for some content of advanced algebra and physics involving deeper mathematical calculations, the general content exceeded high school and was equivalent to university level, and some content was even the latest scientific achievements that current university students have not yet learned. Such as linear programming in mathematics, elemental organic in organic chemistry, and the application of ultrasonic waves and isotopes in agriculture in physics. They completed the basic courses of middle school and university 2,584 class hours in 120 days with 700 class hours, and the exam results were excellent. The second stage is taught entirely according to university standards. This fully demonstrates that peasants are able to quickly learn and master science and technology, and it is possible to find a faster, better, and more economical way for peasants to learn science. This is a new issue in the cultural revolution, and it is worthy of our in-depth study and discussion.

Northwest Agricultural College has initially explored some immature experiences, but these experiences will find a way for peasants to learn science, and also put forward many inspirations for the teaching reform of higher agricultural schools.

		Putting Politics in Command, Ideology First

The teaching practice in the past six months has once again proved that the leadership of the Party is the basic guarantee for the success of all undertakings. The initial success of Wang Baojing's study class is the result of the Party's long-term education and training, and it should be entirely attributed to the leadership of the Party.

Peasants learning science is a tough battle for the intellectualization of workers and peasants, and like the laborization of intellectuals, there will inevitably be an ideological struggle between the proletarian and bourgeois worldviews. It is a rare thing in ancient and modern times for peasants to go to university to learn science, and the emergence of new things is bound to be opposed by old consciousness. It is not surprising that bourgeois intellectuals do not agree, and even the peasants themselves dare not believe that they can go to university and learn science. When individual students encounter difficulties, they also doubt whether they can continue to study? Wanting to retreat and go back to the commune to farm. If these ideas are not resolved, it will be difficult to overcome all the difficulties on the road to learning and open the door to the scientific maze, so we must first break the peasants' mysterious view of science and establish a firm confidence in learning. Putting politics in command is a prerequisite for the success of Wang Baojing and others in learning.

The Party Committee of Northwest Agricultural College fully realized that the study of Wang Baojing's class is not only a matter of a few people's learning, but a cultural revolution of millions of peasants. To win the victory of the revolution on the cultural front, we must first win the victory of the revolution on the ideological front. Under the leadership of the Party, the peasants and the people of the whole country have completed the democratic revolution, and then carried out the socialist revolution and built socialism. Such a big thing has been done, can't we go to university today? After listening to these words from the Party, Wang Baojing and others, after ideological struggle, realized that they must first revolutionize the backward ideology before they can revolutionize the backward culture; they must break the sense of inferiority and the mystery of science, and establish a firm confidence in learning. They believed: If the Party wants us to learn, we will definitely be able to learn, there will definitely be difficulties, and success is certain. They said heroically: "Even if it has thorns, we dare to touch it, even if it is a mountain of knives, we must go up." We must win glory for the Party, we must win glory for the peasants, we must learn well. Despite this, at the beginning, they still had five fears: first, fear of not understanding, second, fear of not being able to remember, third, fear of not being able to use, fourth, fear of not doing well in the exam, and fifth, fear of being laughed at. "Fear" did not make them shrink back in their studies, and the Party led them to turn "anti-five fears" into the driving force to overcome difficulties. They successfully passed the noun pass, the note-taking pass, the calculation pass, the experiment pass, and the theory pass, and embarked on the sunny road of learning. The victory of this struggle laid the ideological foundation for their march towards science.

On the one hand, we must establish Wang Baojing and others' confidence in learning, and on the other hand, we must also establish the teachers' confidence in teaching. The Party Committee of Northwest Agricultural College did a lot of ideological work for the teachers. The Party Committee pointed out that Northwest Agricultural College has been established for twenty-seven years, and has not received such students, and the teachers have taught for more than twenty years, and have not taught such students. Teaching such students is both glorious and arduous. The task of the teachers is not only to teach this class well, but also to explore some experience for hundreds of millions of peasants to learn science. Due to the attention of the Party Committee, it also aroused the attention of the teachers, who felt that the Party Committee entrusted them with such a task, which was the Party's trust in them, and it was also their glory to teach the labor models well. Therefore, they are willing to do their best to teach. But at the beginning, when Wang Baojing understood one-third as being greater than one-half, the teachers were a little doubtful, thinking that with such a foundation, it would be difficult to reach university level within a year. Peasants fight against nature in extremely complex environments, and can understand and master the laws of production. Can't they understand and master the laws of science in the learning process? Moreover, natural science courses need to be thoroughly reformed, coupled with the peasants' enthusiasm, they will definitely be able to learn well. After such an analysis, the teachers' doubts were initially broken. Sure enough, after a period of practice, they overcame all kinds of difficulties in learning. Unexpectedly, Wang Baojing and others even clarified many problems that are considered difficult to understand among university students. From then on, the confidence of teachers and students was established, and the pace of learning became larger and larger.

After solving the ideological problems of teachers and students, the Party Committee of Northwest Agricultural College further improved the relationship between teachers and students and mobilized the enthusiasm of teachers and students. The close relationship between Wang Baojing and others and the teachers is also unprecedented in Northwest Agricultural College. They respect the teachers very much and automatically put forward the slogan of doing a good deed for the teachers every week. On Sundays and holidays, they go to the teachers' homes to sweep the floor, carry water, plant melons, and water vegetables, and they are not only familiar with the teachers, but also with the teachers' families. Wang Baojing's family brought some eggs, and he was reluctant to eat them, so he gave them to the elderly teachers, who were very moved. Now the teachers also give their family's eggs to Wang Baojing. Such a relationship between teachers and students is as close as a family. Wang Baojing and others have even closer contact with young teachers, and they talk about everything. One day, Wang Baojing said to a teacher: "Teacher Huang, your position of 'red and expert' is not properly placed. If you spend ten years to become a professor who is only expert but not red, it is better to spend ten years to strive to become a party member who is both red and expert. As long as you have a political soul, your knowledge can become a treasure." Teacher Huang was very excited and felt that he was progressing too slowly and was far from the requirements of the Party. Although he had the idea of joining the Party, he did not have the courage to submit an application for joining the Party. Under the long-term education of the Party and the influence of Wang Baojing, he finally formally requested to join the Party on the birthday of the Party this year. This is really the combination of red and expert, teaching each other and growing together. With such a relationship between teachers and students, the students' learning goals and the teachers' teaching goals can be organically combined, and any difficulties in learning can be solved.

		Breaking the Old and Establishing the New, Reforming Teaching

Due to the continued deepening of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, and due to the needs of socialist construction and the vigorous development of the technological revolution, it is further required to reform the natural science courses. Without reforming the natural science courses, it will be difficult to rapidly improve the scientific and technological level of the working people in a short period of time. Therefore, after solving the problem of ideological understanding, we must solve the problem of teaching reform.

The fundamental problem of natural science curriculum reform lies in breaking the bourgeois worldview and methodology, holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and establishing a new system and new content of natural science courses that combine Marxism-Leninism with the practice of Chinese revolution and construction. This requirement is not only urgently needed for the teaching of Wang Baojing's study class, but also a long-term and arduous task for China's higher education.

Judging from the current conditions, it is difficult to change it completely, systematically, and maturely all at once. We must adopt a positive and cautious attitude and carry out appropriate reforms, from fragments to the whole, from piecemeal to systematic, gradually complete, and gradually improve. This is not only possible, but also necessary.

Based on the problems existing in the past teaching reforms and combined with the realistic requirements of Wang Baojing's study class, the Party Committee of Northwest Agricultural College pointed out that teachers and students should combine to reform teaching. Therefore, they started with the system of courses, and then reformed the course content and teaching methods. First analyze the problems existing in the basic courses, and then according to their internal connections, find a red line to establish a new system of basic courses, and use this red line to connect the content of the basic courses to form a system. For example, the chemical courses of inorganic, organic, and analytical chemistry have long had the shortcomings of separation of theory and practice and inability to serve the majors well. The content is cumbersome and repetitive, outdated and backward, the system is isolated and fragmented, and lacks organic connection, starting from definitions and concepts, far from production practice and life practice. When Wang Baojing started to learn chemistry, when he talked about the highly generalized laws of material movement such as the law of multiple proportions, the law of definite proportions, and the law of mass action, he didn't even know what matter was? What is matter composed of? Therefore, he felt it difficult to understand these abstract laws. After talking about the structure of matter and the periodic law, he understood the basic structure of matter and its interrelationships, and he didn't feel so abstract and easy to understand about these laws. Therefore, in teaching, we first talk about the structure of matter, then talk about the laws of material movement, first talk about specific laws, then talk about general laws, so as to solve the difficulties in learning. Based on these situations, after a period of research and exploration, the teachers slowly brewed a new system of chemical courses based on the structure of matter and based on chemical reactions. Based on the structure of matter, the laws of material change are connected by chemical reactions. The structure of matter is the basis of change, and chemical reaction is the manifestation of change. For example, organic chemistry reorganizes the structure, nomenclature, classification, manufacture, properties, and application of various organic compounds based on the structure of matter and based on several chemical reactions, thereby greatly shortening the teaching time.

Teaching reform is a major content of the educational revolution, and the reform of the natural science curriculum system will inevitably cause a struggle between the bourgeois and proletarian ideologies. The reform of the chemistry curriculum system is not smooth sailing. When we proposed to reform the chemistry curriculum system, some teachers said: The chemistry system has been established by scientists for thousands of years, how can we change it casually? Isn't this disrespecting science? Therefore, under the leadership of the Party, a sharp ideological struggle was launched.

Wang Baojing said to this teacher: "What is the task that the Party has given you?" The teacher said: "You are a national labor model, and I want to teach you well." Wang Baojing said: "I am an ordinary peasant, not just teaching me alone, but teaching 500 million peasants. Do you have the determination to teach all your knowledge to 500 million peasants?" The teacher said in surprise: "I am working so hard, don't I have the determination?" Wang Baojing said: "It is so difficult for peasants to memorize laws and remember nouns. Since you are determined to give all your knowledge to the peasants, can you use a new scientific system and the language of the peasants to compile a popular chemistry book?" After listening to this, the teacher had a fierce ideological struggle and couldn't sleep well for two nights. He thought that when Wang Baojing came to the college, the Party Committee had told him: to use revolutionary methods, only success is allowed, and failure is not allowed. How is this related to writing a book in the language of peasants? Textbooks have scientific, systematic, logical, and rigorous nature. They are the crystallization of the wisdom of scientists for many years. How can I change them? Isn't this disrespecting science? Wang Baojing said: "When professors come to Fenghuo Commune, the peasants are so enthusiastic, isn't it for learning some scientific knowledge from the professors? If the peasants don't understand science, how can they respect science? Is it that a few intellectuals master science and respect science? Or is it that 500 million peasants master science that is considered to be respectful of science?" Speaking of the issue of systematicness, Wang Baojing said: "The system is set by people. The chemical system established by chemists decades or hundreds of years ago has its own truth, can't we use our truth to set our modern chemical system?" Speaking of the issue of popularization and seriousness, Wang Baojing said: "Popularization does not necessarily mean that it is not serious. Chairman Mao said that agricultural cooperation is progressing very slowly, swaying left and right, like a woman with bound feet walking. This sentence profoundly reflects the spiritual outlook of the right-leaning conservative thought at that time. It is very popular, can you say that it is not serious enough?" After saying all this, today is the people's country, the era of Mao Zedong, what should we do if the peasants want to learn science?

After a sharp ideological struggle, the teachers were determined to boldly change the system, break the old and establish the new, and set about writing a chemistry book suitable for peasants to read. After the system changed, the content also changed accordingly. The victory of this struggle laid the ideological foundation for teaching reform. This is the second key to the initial success of Wang Baojing and others' learning.

		Correct Combination of Practice and Theory

People's understanding comes from practice, practice rises to theory, and theory further guides the development of practice. This is the dialectical relationship between practice and theory. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The process of cognition, the first step is to start contacting external things, which belongs to the stage of sensation. The second step is to synthesize the materials of sensation, organize and transform them, which belongs to the stage of concepts, judgments, and reasoning. Only when the materials of sensation are very rich (not fragmented and incomplete) and in line with reality (not illusion) can correct concepts and theories be created based on such materials." This truth is also very appropriate when applied to teaching. Especially after solving the problems of teaching system and teaching content, it is even more important in reforming teaching methods. The reason why Wang Baojing and others learn quickly and correctly combine theory and practice is also an important reason.

When Wang Baojing and others started learning, they only started from abstract concepts, memorizing by rote, and often couldn't solve the problem until late at night. The Party Committee of Northwest Agricultural College pointed out that learning methods should be found from Chairman Mao's works. After studying works such as "On Practice," "Reform Our Study," and "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," they discovered that the formula of practice-theory-practice is a sunny road for learning natural science. They realized that they found it easier to read crop cultivation, but found it difficult to read physics and chemistry, because they had the practice of cultivating crops, which was easy to understand, but physics and chemistry courses could not be linked to their practice, so it was difficult to understand.

After studying Chairman Mao's works, teachers and students combined to explore three teaching methods. The first is the teaching method of practice first and then theory, experiment first and then lecture, and perceptual first and then rational. Some courses are easier to understand if you do experiments first and then talk about theory, such as analytical chemistry; some courses can be well combined with practice and theory if you lecture and do at the same time, such as physics. It is easy to understand, learn quickly, and has good results when learning theory in this way.

The second is the method of "explaining foreign things with native things" and "explaining native things with foreign things." The so-called "explaining foreign things with native things" is to use familiar phenomena in production practice and life practice to explain the laws of natural science, and the so-called "explaining native things with foreign things" is to use scientific theory to solve practical problems in production. Wang Baojing's view of learning is different from that of ordinary university students. The point of view of linking with reality and applying what you learn is very clear, and the requirements are also very strong. He always asks where the theory that the teacher is talking about comes from, what is it for, and what is it for. "Where does it come from" is to solve the problem of how the theory comes from practice; "What is it for" is to solve the problem of how the theory explains the world; "What is it for" is to solve the problem of how the theory transforms the world; this is as Chairman Mao pointed out: The theory drawn from objective reality and proved in objective reality further guides the development of reality. Using the learning method proposed based on this epistemological principle can enable learners to learn science thoroughly.

The third is the method of lecturing, discussing, practicing, and self-studying. Organically combine these four teaching links and apply them with high flexibility. When a question is finished, ask immediately if there is anything you don't understand, and discuss immediately if there are different opinions. A classroom lecture method can also be turned into a heated classroom discussion. When the discussion is almost over, the teacher will make a summary, which also plays the role of tutoring and answering questions. Sometimes problems are not solved in the classroom, so go to the laboratory to experiment, or move the instruments to the classroom. In this way, organically combining listening, watching, doing, and thinking can greatly shorten the process of understanding objective laws, accelerate teaching progress, and improve teaching quality.

These methods are not obtained out of thin air, but through ideological struggle. At the beginning, they didn't know how to use these methods, they only knew how to work hard, not cleverly, they only knew how to memorize, regardless of the combination of work and rest, working until midnight, staying up late, not only did not solve the problem, but one of them fell ill. They deeply felt that learning science is not as easy as eating tofu, nor is it as easy as farming. You can't just rely on courage, you also need to rely on strategy. After studying Chairman Mao's works, they found the way to learn science of practice-theory-practice and created many learning methods.

Although these experiences are very immature, they are enough to show that peasants have tried every means to open the door to the scientific maze and have marched onto the scientific position heroically and vigorously. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party and under the glorious illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, the peasants will surely shine brightly on the cultural and production fronts.

    农民学科学的新途径
    康迪
    迅速提高农民的科学技术水平是文化战线和生产战线上的重大问题。我国农业有悠久的历史，农民群众在长期生产实践中积累了极其丰富的经验。解放十一年来在党的领导下，尤其是在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀下，更创造了许多先进经验。这不但对提高农业生产具有极重要的意义，而且对发展科学理论也提出了不少值得研究的新问题。农民虽然在生产实践中获得了不少经验，但是，他们由于文化科学水平的限制，不会运用科学知识和方法加以总结，使之上升为理论原则，当然也就不能用来普遍地指导农业生产。同时，由于农业现代化的迅速发展，农业迫切需要用现代科学技术来武装，而农民在这一方面也受了很大的限制，因而难以运用现代科学技术来指导农业生产的进一步发展。一方面不能把实践上升为理论，另一方面又不能用理论去指导实践和发展实践；这就是目前农民迫切要求学习科学技术的根本原因。
    理论一旦掌握了群众，便立刻成为物质力量。千百万农民一旦掌握了农业科学理论与技术，那就一定能在生产战线上发出无穷无尽的物质力量，高速度地发展我国农业生产。因此，农民学科学已成为文化战线和生产战线上一项带战略性的重要任务。
    今年2月，中共陕西省委批准全国农业劳动模范王保京到西北农学院学习农业科学技术一年，烽火人民公社派了八名青年农民随王保京一道学习。这九个人的情况，基本上可以分为三种类型：王保京代表政治觉悟高，文化程度低，理解能力强，生产经验丰富的优秀模范人物；张文信等二人代表文化低、理解能力较差，种过几年庄稼的淳朴忠厚的农民；魏仲文等六人代表经常参加农业生产劳动，有初中文化程度的农村青年。很显然，这三类人的社会经历不同，程度相差悬殊，在教学上会遇到些困难；如果能取得一些经验，也就有了一般的意义。
    从2月8日起，经过一百二十天，他们学完了数学（包括算术、代数、几何、三角）、无机及分机化学、有机化学、物理学和植物学五门基础课。从9月1日起又开始学习植物生理、微生物、植物病理、农业昆虫等专业基础课。在五门基础课的学习中，除高等代数的部分内容和物理学涉及较深的数学计算外，一般内容都超过高中，相当于大学水平，有些内容甚至是现在大学生还没有学的最新科学成就。如数学中的线性规划，有机化学中的原素有机，物理学的超声波、同位素在农业上的应用等。他们在一百二十天内用七百学时学完了中学、大学二千五百八十四学时的基础课，考试成绩优等。第二阶段完全按照大学水平进行教学。这充分地说明农民是能够迅速地学习和掌握科学技术的，要找出一条农民学科学的多快好省的途径是可能的。这是文化革命中的新问题，很值得我们深入研究和探讨。
    西北农学院初步摸出几条不成熟的经验，但这些经验将为农民学科学找出一条途径，就是对高等农业学校的教学改革，也提出了不少启示。
                政治挂帅　思想先行
    半年来的教学实践，又一次地证明了党的领导是一切事业成功的基本保证。王保京这个学习班的初步成功，是党的长期教育和培养的结果，完全应该归功于党的领导。
    农民学科学是工农群众知识化的攻坚战役，和知识分子劳动化一样，必然会有无产阶级与资产阶级两种世界观的思想斗争。农民上大学学科学是古今罕见的新事情，新事物的产生，就免不了要遭到旧意识的反对。资产阶级知识分子不以为然，这倒没有什么奇怪，就是农民自己也不敢相信自己能上大学，能学科学。在个别学员中碰到困难的时候，也怀疑自己能否学下去？想打退堂鼓回社种地。这些思想不解决，就很难克服学习道路上的一切困难，打开科学迷宫的大门，所以首先必须打破农民对科学的神秘观点，树立坚强的学习信心。政治挂帅，是王保京等学习成功的先决条件。
    西北农学院党委充分地认识到，王保京这个班的学习，不仅是几个人的学习问题，而是千百万农民的文化革命问题。要取得文化战线上革命的胜利，必须首先取得思想战线上革命的胜利。农民在党的领导下和全国人民一起完成了民主革命，又进而进行社会主义革命和建设社会主义，这么大的事情都办了，难道今天上个大学还不成？王保京等听了党的这一番话，经过思想斗争，认识到必须先革思想落后的命，然后才能革文化落后的命；必须打破自卑感和对科学的神秘感，树立坚强的学习信心。他们相信：党要我们来学，就一定能学成，困难一定会有，成功也是肯定的。他们豪迈地说：“科学是人创造出来的，人就能理解它，农民不少胳膊不少腿，人家能办到的，农民为什么办不到？”他们表示了决心：“就是它长了刺，我们也敢碰，那怕它是刀山，我们也要上。”要为党争一口气，要为农民争一口气，一定要学好。尽管如此，在开始的时候，他们还有五怕，一怕听不懂，二怕记不下，三怕不会用，四怕考不好，五怕人笑话。“怕”并没有使他们在学习中畏缩不前，党领导他们把“反五怕”变成了克服困难的动力。他们胜利地渡过了名词关、笔记关、计算关、实验关、理论关，走上了学习的阳关大道。这一场斗争的胜利，奠定了他们向科学进军的思想基础。
    一方面要树立王保京等的学习信心，另一方面也要树立教师们教课的信心。西北农学院党委对任课教师做了不少思想工作。党委指出，西北农学院创办了二十七年了，还没有收过这样的学生，老师们教了二十多年书，也没有教过这样的学生，教这样的学生既光荣又艰巨。老师的任务不仅是要把这一个班教好，而且要为几亿农民学科学摸索出一点经验。由于党委的重视，也引起教师的重视，感到党委交给他们这样的任务，是党对自己的信任，把劳动模范教好，也是自己的光荣。因此都愿尽最大努力来教。但一开始碰到王保京把三分之一理解为比二分之一大的时候，教师们又有点怀疑，觉得像这样的基础，恐怕一年内难以达到大学水平。农民在极其复杂的环境下和自然斗争，能认识和掌握生产规律，难道就不能在学习过程中认识和掌握科学规律吗？况且自然科学课程需要进行彻底改革，再加上农民的干劲，是一定能学好的。经过这样的分析，才初步打破了教师们的疑问。果然在一段时间的实践以后，克服了学习中的种种困难。出乎教师意料之外的，是王保京等竟然把许多在大学生中认为难以理解的问题也都弄清楚了。从此老师和学生的信心都树立起来了，学习的步子也就越踏越大了。
    西北农学院党委在解决了老师和学生的思想问题以后，又进一步搞好师生关系，调动师生的积极性。王保京等和老师的亲密关系也是西北农学院从来没有见过的。他们非常尊敬老师，自动地提出每周为老师做一件好事的口号。一到星期日和假期，他们就到老师家里去扫地、担水、种瓜、浇菜等，不但和老师很熟，而且连老师家里的人也很熟。王保京家里捎来几个鸡蛋，他舍不得吃，送给年老教师吃，老师很为感动。现在老师也把家里鸡蛋送给王保京吃。这样的师生关系，正是亲如一家。王保京等和青年教师来往更为密切，无话不谈。有一天王保京和一位教师说：“黄老师，你把红专的位置摆得不适当。你花十年功夫弄成个只专不红的教授，还不如花十年功夫争取做一个又红又专的党员，只要有了政治灵魂，你的知识，才能成为活宝。”黄老师内心很激动，感觉自己进步太慢，距离党的要求很远，虽有入党之念，但无勇气递上入党申请书。在党的长期教育及王保京的影响下，他终于在今年党的生日正式提出了入党的要求。这真是红专结合，教学相长。有了这样的师生关系，就能把学生的学习目的和教师的教书目的有机地结合起来，任何学习上的困难都能解决。
              破旧立新　改革教学
    由于政治战线和思想战线社会主义革命的继续深入，由于社会主义建设的需要和技术革命蓬勃的发展，就进一步要求改革自然科学的课程。自然科学的课程不改革，也很难在短时期内迅速提高劳动人民的科学技术水平。因此在解决思想认识问题以后，就必须解决教学改革问题。
    自然科学课程改革的根本问题，在于破除资产阶级世界观和方法论，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，建立起马克思列宁主义与中国革命和建设实践相结合的自然科学课程的新体系和新内容。这个要求，不仅是王保京这个学习班的教学所急需，也是我国高等教育一个长期而艰巨的任务。
    就目前的条件来看，要一下子改得很完整，很系统，很成熟，是有困难的，必须采取积极而慎重的态度，进行适当的改革，由片段到整体，由零碎到系统，逐步完整，逐步完善。这不仅是可能的，而且是必要的。
    西北农学院党委根据过去教学改革中所存在的问题，结合王保京学习班的现实要求，指出要师生结合来改革教学，于是他们从课程的体系入手，然后改革课程内容和教学方法。首先分析基础课存在的问题，然后根据其内在联系，找出建立基础课新体系的一根红线，用这根红线把基础课的内容贯串起来，构成体系。如无机、有机、分机这几门化学课程，长期存在理论与实际脱节，不能很好地为专业服务的缺点。内容繁琐重复，陈旧落后，体系孤立割裂，缺乏有机联系，从定义和概念出发，距离生产实践和生活实践很远。当王保京开始学化学的时候，讲到倍比定律、定比定律、相量定律等高度概括的物质运动规律的时候，还不知道物质是什么？物质是什么组成的？因此对这些抽象的定律，觉得难以理解。等到讲完物质结构和周期律以后，了解了物质的基本结构及其相互关系，对这些定律，就不感觉那么抽象而容易理解了。因而在教学中就先讲物质结构，后讲物质运动规律，先讲具体规律，后讲一般规律，这样才解决了学习中的困难。教师们根据这些情况，经过一段时间的研究和摸索，慢慢地酝酿出以物质结构为基础，以化学反应为纲，建立化学课的新体系。在物质结构的基础上，把物质变化的规律，用化学反应贯串起来。物质结构是变化的基础，化学反应是变化的表现，如有机化学就把各类有机化合物的结构、命名、分类、制造、性质、应用等都以物质结构为基础，以几个化学反应为纲，把教材重行加以组织，因而能大大地缩短教学的时间。
    教学改革是教育大革命的一个主要内容，自然科学课程体系的改革，也必然会引起资产阶级与无产阶级两种思想的斗争。化学课体系的改革，就不是风平浪静的。当我们提出要进行化学课体系改革的时候，有的老师就说：化学体系是千百年来科学家建立起来的，我们怎能随便改变，这岂不是对科学不尊重吗？于是在党的领导下展开了一场尖锐的思想斗争。
    王保京和这位老师说：“党交给你的任务是什么？”老师说：“你是全国劳动模范，要把你教好。”王保京说：“我是一个普通农民，不是把我一个人教好，而是把五亿农民都要教好。你有没有决心把你的知识全部教给五亿农民呢？”这位老师很惊讶地说：“我鼓这么大的劲，难道还没有决心？”王保京说：
  “农民背定律，记名词多么困难，你既有心把你的知识全部交给农民，你能不能用新的科学体系，用农民的语言，编出一本通俗的化学书？”这位老师听了以后，产生了激烈的思想斗争，两夜没有睡好觉。他想到王保京来院时，党委叮咛过：要用革命的方法，只准成功，不准失败。这和用农民的语言编书，又如何联系？教科书有科学性、系统性、逻辑性、严密性，是多少年来科学家智慧的结晶，我怎么能改变？这不是对科学不尊重吗？王保京说：“教授来烽火社，农民那么热情，还不是为的向教授学点科学知识，农民不懂科学又如何去尊重科学？是少数知识分子掌握科学对科学尊重呢？还是五亿农民掌握了科学才算是对科学尊重呢？”说到系统性的问题，王保京说：“系统是人定出来的。化学家在几十年几百年前订出来的化学体系，有他的道理，我们就不能用我们的道理，订出我们现代的化学体系吗？”说到通俗化和严肃性的问题，王保京说：“通俗化不一定不严肃，毛主席说农业合作化进展很慢，左右摇摆，像小脚女人走路，这句话深刻地反映了当时右倾保守思想的精神面貌，非常通俗，你能说不够严肃吗？”千说万说，今天是人民的江山，毛泽东时代，农民要学科学，怎么办？
    经过一场尖锐的思想斗争，教师们下决心大胆改变体系，破旧立新，着手编写一本适合于农民阅读的化学书。体系改变以后，内容也相应地随着改变。这一场斗争的胜利，奠定了教学改革的思想基础。这是王保京等学习初步成功的第二个关键。
                实践和理论正确结合
    人的认识来源于实践，实践上升为理论，理论再进一步指导实践的发展。这是实践与理论的辩证关系。毛泽东同志说：“认识的过程，第一步，是开始接触外界事情，属于感觉的阶段。第二步，是综合感觉的材料加以整理和改造，属于概念、判断和推理的阶段。只有感觉的材料十分丰富（不是零碎不全）和合于实际（不是错觉），才能根据这样的材料造出正确的概念和理论来。”这个真理运用于教学也非常之确当。尤其是在解决教学体系与教学内容问题以后，在改革教学方法上，更为重要。王保京等之所以学得快，正确地把理论与实践结合起来，也是个重要的原因。
    王保京等开始学习的时候，只是从抽象的概念出发，死背硬记，经常搞到深夜还不能解决问题。西北农学院党委指出从毛主席的著作中找学习方法。他们学了《实践论》、《改造我们的学习》、《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》等著作以后，发现了实践——理论——实践这一公式是学习自然科学的一条阳关大道。他们体会到，他们读作物栽培比较容易，而读物理、化学就觉得困难，是因为他们有栽培作物的实践，容易领会，而物理、化学课程不能和他们的实践联系起来，因而就难懂。
    经过对毛主席著作的学习，师生结合摸出了三个教学方法。第一个是先实践后理论，先实验后讲授，先感性后理性的教学方法。有些课程先做实验，然后再讲理论就比较容易懂，如分机化学等；有些课程要边讲边做，边做边讲，也能使实践与理论很好结合，如物理学等。这样学理论，容易懂，学得快，效果好。
    第二个是“以土解洋”和“以洋解土”的方法。所谓“以土解洋”就是用生产实践与生活实践中所熟悉的现象来解释自然科学的规律，所谓“以洋解土”就是用科学理论来解决生产中的实际问题。王保京学习和一般大学生不同，联系实际，学以致用的观点非常明确，要求也非常之强烈。教师所讲的理论，他总要问是怎么来的，干啥的，有啥用。“怎么来”是解决理论如何从实践中来的问题；“干啥的”是解决理论如何说明世界的问题；“有啥用”是解决理论如何改造世界的问题；这就如毛主席所指出的：从客观实际中抽出来，又在客观实际中得到证明的理论，再进一步去指导实际的发展。运用根据这一认识论原理提出来的学习方法，就能使学习者把科学学得透彻。
    第三是边讲授、边讨论、边实践、边自学的方法。把这四个教学环节有机地结合起来，高度灵活地加以运用。当讲完一个问题，如有不懂的地方马上就问，如有不同的看法马上就讨论，一个课堂讲授的方式，也可以变成一个争论热烈的课堂讨论，当讨论到差不多的时候，教师再做个总结，又起辅导答疑的作用。有时课堂不解决问题，就进实验室去实验，或者把仪器搬到课堂。这样把听、看、做、想有机结合起来，就能大大地缩短对客观规律的认识过程，加速教学进度，提高教学质量。
    这些方法的获得也不是凭空而来的，而是经过思想斗争的。开始他们并不知道运用这些方法，只会苦干，不会巧干，只知死扣，不管劳逸结合，搞半夜，熬红眼，不但不解决问题，反而病倒了一个。他们深深感到，学科学不是像吃豆腐那样容易，也不像种庄稼那样能使上劲。不能光凭勇敢，还要靠有计谋。在学习毛主席著作以后，找到实践——理论——实践这一学科学的门路，创造了许多学习方法。
    虽然这些经验是很不成熟的，但足以说明，农民已千方百计地打开了科学迷宫的大门，雄赳赳气昂昂地踏上了科学阵地。我们坚信在党的领导下，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，农民在文化战线和生产战线上一定能放出万丈光芒。
