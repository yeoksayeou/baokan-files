　　Friendship Forged in Blood and Sweat, Never to be Forgotten
    ——A Record of the Visit and Performances of the Korean People's Army Ensemble in China
    Wei Chuantong
    At the time when the Chinese people solemnly commemorated the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea on "October 25th," the fraternal Korean people and army sent friendly envoys—the Korean People's Army Ensemble—to visit and perform in our country. This not only added luster to this historically significant day but also made valuable contributions to enhancing the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples.
    In addition to participating in the commemorative activities for the tenth anniversary of the Volunteers' War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea in the capital, Beijing, the Korean People's Army Ensemble also visited and performed in cities such as Wuhan, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, and Shenyang. At the same time, they visited factories, schools, and people's communes, and met with the broad masses of the Chinese people and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. The Korean People's Army Ensemble's visit and performances in China lasted forty-two days. Their performances in China achieved great success, leaving an extremely deep impression on the broad masses of the Chinese people and army.
    Performances Reflecting Revolutionary Friendship
    The Korean People's Army Ensemble's visit and performances in our country not only brought us rich and colorful song and dance art but also the profound friendship of the Korean people and army. The broad masses of the Chinese people and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, with incomparable excitement, appreciated the successful performances of the Korean artists from the stage, television, and radio. This not only gave the Chinese people and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army a beautiful artistic enjoyment but also provided a profound education in internationalism. The programs they performed profoundly reflected the correct policy of literature and art serving politics and serving production. Their themes depicted revolutionary war and revolutionary class feelings. From their performances, we recalled the many heroic deeds and moving scenes of the two peoples fighting together in those difficult years. At the same time, it also aroused our deep remembrance of the heroic Korean people; and made us feel the greatness and preciousness of the strength of this class friendship generated for the common revolutionary cause.
    The performances of the Korean People's Army Ensemble were not only warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the Chinese people and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army as well as many former officers and soldiers of the Volunteers, but also received great attention and concern from our Party and state leaders. Our people's most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, not only watched the performances of the Korean artists but also received the leading cadres and main actors of the ensemble and had cordial conversations with them. The comrades of the ensemble were very excited and moved by Chairman Mao's speech. Deputy Head Cui Changyin said, "Every word of Chairman Mao gave us great encouragement and strength." Some members excitedly said: "The great leader of over 600 million people came to see our performances and shook hands with us on stage. This is a joy that we will never forget in our lives." After the performances, many comrades talked about the scene of meeting Chairman Mao for a long time. The Korean People's Army Ensemble's love and respect for the great leader of the Chinese people truly expressed the deep feelings of the Korean people for the people of our country.
    Fighting Shoulder to Shoulder to Defend Peace
    During their visit and performances in China, the ensemble specially visited the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front. As soon as the ensemble arrived at the front, they went deep into the forward positions with full enthusiasm in the rain, greeted the frontline troops, and had a get-together with them. They gave cordial greetings and encouragement to the People's Liberation Army of our country, who were vigilantly guarding the Southeast coastal defense front. Some members said: "You are guarding the Fujian front, just like we are guarding the 38th parallel. In order to eliminate the common enemy, we are guarding the forefront of the battle together. If our two armies unite closely and carry out a resolute struggle, we will definitely be able to drive the American aggressors out of the territories of Korea and China." The ensemble's arrival at the forward positions not only brought joy to the officers and soldiers of our frontline People's Liberation Army, but also gave us tremendous support. What was particularly exciting was that the comrades of the ensemble, facing the turbulent East China Sea and our territory of Taiwan, sang in fluent Chinese:
    No one can infringe on our territory,
    No one can stop our powerful troops;
    Our thousands of troops will cross the ocean,
    We must plant the flag of victory,
    On our motherland's Taiwan.
    This song expressed the fraternal Korean people's full support for the Chinese people's liberation of their territory of Taiwan. This song greatly encouraged the belief of the Chinese and Korean peoples in defeating the common enemy. To thank the comrades of the ensemble, the frontline soldiers chose the most meaningful things—vases made from shells that bombarded Jinmen, filled with flowers; sickles and axes made from shrapnel fired by the enemy—to give to their close comrades-in-arms. These two gifts symbolize that peace must be won through struggle, and that for the sake of a common cause, we will always fight together.
    At the front lines, the comrades also met the militia heroes, the "Ten Sisters of the Front," the "Little Eighth Route Army," and the "Mu Guiying Militia Class" who guarded the coastal defense front day and night with the People's Liberation Army. When they met, they talked very intimately, just like meeting their own brothers and sisters. A member of the ensemble said: "Seeing with my own eyes the broad masses of militia fighting together with the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front has made us further understand the great significance of all the people being soldiers." Deputy Head Kim Byung-soon said: "Here, we have seen a wall of bronze and iron and the high fighting will of the army and the people. We firmly believe that the Chinese people will surely be able to liberate the coastal islands, and Taiwan will surely return to the embrace of the Chinese people."
    Mutual Encouragement in Construction
    During their visit and performances in China, the Korean People's Army Ensemble was very concerned about and attached great importance to the various achievements made in China's socialist construction. Wherever they went, they visited factories, schools, and people's communes in our country with full enthusiasm. They enthusiastically praised the three red banners of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes in our country. They regarded the various achievements made by our country under the guidance of the three red banners as their own achievements and felt happy. In Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang and other places, they not only visited the industrial exhibition hall, but also visited many factories and large-scale buildings. They were very impressed by the large scale and rapid speed of China's construction. When they visited the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, they were amazed that this magnificent building could be completed in such a short period of time. Deputy Head Cui Changyin said, "China can build such a big bridge today, and it can do anything in the future." When visiting Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation and Wuhan Heavy Machinery Plant, they praised the scale of China's construction even more. Some members said that the scale of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation fully shows the great achievements of China's Great Leap Forward. The comrades of the ensemble were not only interested in our country's large new construction projects, but also very happy about every achievement made by our country's small and medium-sized enterprises and in technological innovation. After visiting Shanghai Pengpu Machine Factory and Nanjing Second Machinery Factory, they said that these factories have grown from small to large and from poor to good, which is precious. When the ensemble visited Shanghai Fa Chang Machine Factory, some members said: "It is really amazing that a small factory can build large machines. I only knew about the 'ants gnawing at bones' in China's industry before, but I had never seen it. Today I saw it, which deepened our understanding of the general line of building socialism put forward by the Chinese Communist Party."
    The comrades of the ensemble were also very concerned about the people's communes in our country. Whether it was the Hongxing China-Korea Friendship People's Commune in Beijing or the Xin'jiao People's Commune in Guangzhou, they cordially talked with the members with great care, learned about the production and living conditions after the establishment of the communes, and greatly praised the commune-run industries. Head Zhang Ruihuan said: "With the organization of the people's communes, we can see the full play of people's creativity and the improvement of labor efficiency everywhere. If the people's communes were not established, some things would be unimaginable. The people's communes have truly brought happiness to the people, so they are supported by the broad masses of the people, which also proves that Chairman Mao and the policies of the Chinese Communist Party are very popular." The members generally reflected that they often saw news about China's Great Leap Forward in newspapers at home in the past, but this time they saw it in person and had a more concrete understanding and a deeper experience. China's various construction achievements are all products of the Great Leap Forward. The head said: "China's Great Leap Forward and Korea's Chollima are both for high-speed socialist construction. We firmly believe that our two countries will not only catch up with Western capitalist countries in a not too long period of time, but also leave them far behind."
    Always Unite Closely and Advance Shoulder to Shoulder
    In addition to visiting and performing in various places, the Korean People's Army Ensemble expressed the Korean people's and army's deep remembrance and wishes to the former Chinese People's Volunteer officers and soldiers. They also gave cordial condolences to the former volunteer wounded and sick soldiers. At the same time, they laid wreaths and mourned at Huanghuagang in Guangzhou, Yuhuatai in Nanjing, and the Martyrs' Cemetery in Shenyang. Many comrades shed tears at the tombs of martyrs such as Yang Gensi, Huang Jiguang, and Qiu Shaoyun. Head Zhang Ruihuan said countless times: We will always stand with the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army and advance shoulder to shoulder for our common cause!
    The great friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Korea has undergone severe tests and is eternal and unbreakable. The Korean People's Army Ensemble's visit and performances in our country this time have been solemnly and warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the people and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in various places, which is by no means accidental. Because the peoples of China and Korea shed blood together in opposing our most ferocious common enemy, American imperialism; in the cause of socialist construction, we learn from each other, support each other, and sweat together for our common cause. On the road ahead, our two peoples will always help each other, support each other, and encourage each other. It is precisely:
    We weather the storm together, and share good and bad fortune;
    Friendship forged in blood and sweat, never to be forgotten! (with picture)
    On November 11, the Korean People's Army Ensemble performed the Chinese dance "Spring Comes to the Tea Mountain" for the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front.

    血汗铸友谊　世代毋相忘
    ——记朝鲜人民军协奏团在我国的访问演出
    魏传统
    在中国人民隆重纪念“十·二五”中国人民志愿军抗美援朝出国作战十周年的时候，兄弟的朝鲜人民和军队派来了友好使者——朝鲜人民军协奏团到我国访问演出，这不仅给这具有历史意义的日子增加了光彩，而且对增进中朝两国人民的传统友谊，作出了可贵的贡献。
    朝鲜人民军协奏团除在北京参加了我国首都各界纪念志愿军抗美援朝十周年的活动外，并赴武汉、广州、厦门、福州、杭州、上海、南京、天津、沈阳等城市进行了访问演出。同时在各地参观访问了工厂、学校和人民公社，与我国广大人民及解放军官兵见了面。朝鲜人民军协奏团在我国的访问演出，历时四十二天。他们在中国的演出获得了巨大的成功，给我国广大人民和军队留下了极其深刻的印象。
    反映了革命友谊的演出
    朝鲜人民军协奏团这次来我国访问演出，不仅给我们带来了丰富多彩的歌舞艺术，而且带来了朝鲜人民和军队的深情厚谊。我国广大人民和解放军官兵，怀着无比激动与兴奋的心情，从舞台上，从电视、广播里欣赏了朝鲜艺术家们的成功的演出，这不仅使我国人民和解放军官兵得到了一次优美的艺术享受，而且也受到了一次深刻的国际主义教育。他们演出的节目里，深刻地反映了文艺为政治服务、为生产服务的正确方针。它们的主题描绘了革命战争与革命的阶级感情。从他们的表演中，使我们回忆起在那些艰苦的岁月里，两国人民共同作战的许多可歌可泣的英雄事迹和动人场面。同时，也引起我们对英雄的朝鲜人民的深切怀念；更使我们感到为了共同的革命事业而产生的这种阶级友谊力量的伟大和可贵。
    朝鲜人民军协奏团的演出，不仅受到了我国广大人民和解放军官兵以及许多前志愿军官兵们的热烈欢迎，而且受到了我们党和国家领导人的极大重视和关怀。我国人民最敬爱的领袖毛主席不但观看了朝鲜艺术家的演出，而且还接见了协奏团的领导干部与主要演员，并作了亲切的交谈。协奏团的同志们听到毛主席的讲话都十分兴奋与激动。副团长崔昌殷同志说：“毛主席的每句话都给了我们巨大的鼓舞和力量。”有的团员激动地说：六亿多人民的伟大领袖来看我们的演出，并上台同我们握手，这是我们一生难忘的喜悦。演出结束后，许多同志长久谈论着与毛主席会见的情景。朝鲜人民军协奏团对中国人民伟大的领袖的热爱与尊敬，真实地表达了朝鲜人民对我国人民的深厚感情。
    为保卫和平而并肩斗争
    协奏团在中国访问演出期间，特地访问了福建前线的解放军官兵。协奏团一到前线，就以满腔热情冒雨深入前沿阵地，向前线部队问候并在一起联欢。他们对警惕地守卫在东南海防前线的我国人民解放军，给予亲切的慰问和鼓励。有的团员说：“你们守卫在福建前线，就像我们守卫在三八线一样。为了消灭共同的敌人，我们共同守卫在战斗的最前线。我们两支军队紧密团结起来，进行坚决斗争，就一定能把美国侵略者从朝鲜和中国的领土上赶出去。”协奏团来到前沿阵地，不仅给我们前线解放军官兵带来了欢乐，而且也给予我们莫大的支持。特别令人激动的是协奏团的同志面对波涛滚滚的东海，面对我国领土台湾，用纯熟的中文唱出：
    我们的领土谁也不能侵犯，
    我们强大的队伍谁也不能阻拦；
    我们千军万马要跨过海洋，
    一定要把胜利的旗帜，
    插到祖国的台湾。
    这歌声表达了兄弟的朝鲜人民对中国人民解放自己领土台湾的全力支持。这歌声大大鼓舞中朝两国人民战胜共同敌人的信念。为了感谢协奏团同志，前线战士选择了最有意义的东西——用炮轰金门的弹壳做成花瓶，插上鲜花；用敌人打过来的弹片做成镰刀斧头——赠给亲密的战友。这两件礼物，象征着和平必须用斗争来争取，象征着为了共同的事业，我们永远战斗在一起。
    在前沿阵地上，战友们还会见了日日夜夜与解放军一起守卫海防前线的民兵英雄，前沿十姐妹、小八路、穆桂英民兵班。他们相会时，就像见到自己的兄弟姊妹一样，谈得十分亲切。协奏团的一个团员同志说：在福建前线亲眼看到了广大民兵与解放军在一起战斗，这使我们进一步懂得了全民皆兵的重大意义。副团长金炳淳同志说：“在这里，我们看到了铜墙铁壁的队伍和军民高昂的战斗意志。我们坚信，中国人民一定能够解放沿海岛屿，台湾一定会回到中国人民的怀抱。”
    在建设事业中互相鼓舞
    朝鲜人民军协奏团在我国访问演出期间，十分关心与重视我国社会主义建设所取得的各项成就。每到一地，他们都满腔热情地参观我国工厂、学校和人民公社，他们热情赞扬我国总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，他们把我国在三面红旗指引下所取得的各项成就看作自己的成就一样感到高兴。他们在北京、上海、沈阳等地，不但参观了工业展览馆，而且还参观访问了许多工厂与大型建筑，他们对我国建设规模之大，速度之快十分钦佩。他们在参观武汉长江大桥时，对这座宏伟建筑能在短时期内建成，感到惊奇。副团长崔昌殷同志说：“中国今天能建成这样大的桥，今后就什么事也能办到。”在参观武钢和武汉重型机床厂时，对我国的建设规模倍加赞扬。有的团员说，从武钢的规模就可以充分看出中国大跃进的巨大成就。协奏团的同志不但对我国大的新的建设项目感到兴趣，而且对我国中小型企业和在技术革新中所取得的每一项成就都感到十分高兴。他们在参观了上海彭浦机器厂、南京第二机械厂后说，这些厂都是由小到大，由差到好，可贵就在这里。协奏团在参观上海发昌机器厂时，有的团员说：“小厂造大机器真是了不起。以前只知道中国工业上有个‘蚂蚁啃骨头’，但没有见过。今天见到了，加深了我们对中国共产党所提出的建设社会主义的总路线的理解。”
    协奏团的同志也十分关心我国人民公社，不论在北京的红星中朝友好人民公社，还是在广州的新滘人民公社，他们都以十分关怀的心情与社员亲切交谈，了解公社建立以后的生产、生活情况，并对社办工业大加赞扬。团长张瑞焕同志说：“组织了人民公社，处处看到充分发挥了人的创造性，提高了劳动效率。如果不建立人民公社，有些东西是不可想像的。人民公社真正给人民带来了幸福，所以得到广大人民的拥护，这也证明毛主席和中国共产党的政策是十分深入人心的。”团员们普遍反映：过去在国内从报纸上经常看到中国大跃进的消息，但这次亲自看到，了解更为具体，体会更加深刻。中国的各项建设成就，都是大跃进的产物。团长说：“中国的大跃进和朝鲜的千里马一样，都是为了高速度建设社会主义。我们深信：我们两国不但可以在不太长的时间内赶上西方的资本主义国家，而且要把它们远远抛在后面。”
    永远紧密团结并肩前进
    朝鲜人民军协奏团除在各地参观访问外，并向前中国人民志愿军官兵表达了朝鲜人民和军队对他们深切的怀念与祝愿。他们还对前志愿军伤病员作了亲切的慰问。同时，他们在广州的黄花岗，在南京的雨花台，在沈阳的烈士陵园献了花圈，作了悼念。不少同志在杨根思、黄继光、丘少云等烈士墓前洒下了热泪。团长张瑞焕同志无数次地说道：我们永远同中国人民和中国人民解放军站在一起，为着我们共同的事业而并肩前进！
    中朝两国人民及其军队之间的伟大友谊，是经历了严峻考验的，是永恒的、牢不可破的。朝鲜人民军协奏团这次在我国的访问演出，受到了各地广大人民及解放军官兵的隆重而热烈的欢迎，这决不是偶然的。因为，中朝两国人民在反对我们最凶恶的共同敌人美帝国主义的时候，一起流过血；在社会主义的建设事业中，又相互学习，互相支援，为我们的共同事业，一起流过汗。在今后的前进道路上，我们两国人民将永远互相帮助，互相支持，互相鼓舞。正是：
    风雨同舟济，祸福与共尝；
    血汗铸友谊，世代毋相忘！（附图片）
