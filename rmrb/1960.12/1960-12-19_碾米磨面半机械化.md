    Semi-Mechanized Rice Milling and Flour Grinding
    (Reported by our newspaper) Wangkui County, Heilongjiang Province, is promoting the use of animal-powered, capstan-geared semi-mechanized rice mills and flour mills, saving manpower and animal power to reinforce the front line of agricultural production.
    In the past, Wangkui County used earthen rice mills and flour mills for grain processing, which consumed a large amount of labor and animal power every year. According to the instructions of the County Party Committee, the County Agricultural Machinery Bureau convened a meeting of the tool reform group, mobilizing the masses to study the principle of the liberation-style waterwheel and animal-powered prime mover, utilizing the role of the capstan to realize semi-mechanization of rice mills and flour mills. Wang Zhanjiang, a worker at the Tiemu Factory of the Zheng Lan Qiantou Management Area of the Hongxing Commune, where the technical innovation and technical revolution movement were developing well, after fifteen days of painstaking research and seven experiments, first made rice mills and flour mills driven by capstans. The County Party Committee held an on-site meeting in Hongxing Commune and promoted this experience throughout the county.
    By October 31, the county had transformed sixty-five earthen rice mills and seventy-five earthen flour mills. On average, each semi-mechanized rice mill and flour mill can process 2,400 catties of grain per day, increasing efficiency fivefold compared to the old rice mills and flour mills. From March to October, more than 133,000 man-days and 234,000 horse-days were saved.

    碾米磨面半机械化
    本报讯　黑龙江省望奎县推广畜力牵引、绞关变速的半机械化的碾、磨，节省出人力、畜力，充实到农业生产第一线。
    望奎县过去用土碾、土磨加工粮食，每年需要耗费大量人工、畜力。根据县委指示，县农业机械局召开了工具改革小组会议，发动群众根据解放式水车、畜力原动机的原理，研究利用绞关的作用，实现碾、磨半机械化。技术革新、技术革命运动开展较好的红星公社正蓝前头管理区的铁木厂工人王占江，经过十五天的苦心钻研，七次试验，首先制成了用绞关带动的碾、磨。县委在红星公社召开了现场会议，在全县推广了这一经验。
    到10月31日，全县已经改土碾子六十五台，改土磨七十五台。半机械化的碾、磨平均每台一天可以加工两千四百斤粮食，比旧碾、磨提高效率五倍。从3月到10月，就节省人工十三万三千多个，马工二十三万四千多个。
