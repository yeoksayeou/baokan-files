Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 12th: The Korean newspaper "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial today entitled "A Call to Battle," stating that the Appeal to the People of the World and the Statement from the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries are of great significance in powerfully inspiring and mobilizing the people of the world to oppose the war policies of the imperialists and to carry out the struggle to defend peace.

The editorial stated that the Appeal to the People of the World more clearly explains the fact that the threat to world peace comes from the war policies of the imperialists headed by US imperialism, and puts forward the programmatic tasks of preventing war and maintaining and consolidating peace. The struggle to defend peace and oppose the threat of a new world war is the most urgent task for all mankind today. At the same time, the documents adopted by the Moscow Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries more firmly expressed the confidence that the goal of defending peace can be achieved as long as all forces opposing imperialism and loving peace unite and carry out active struggle.

The editorial said that the fundamental change in the balance of power on the world stage, with the forces of socialism and peace further overwhelming and surpassing the forces of imperialism and war, has created the current situation in which the imperialists' conspiracies of war provocation are bankrupt and there is a real possibility of preventing war. However, this does not mean that peace will come naturally. As the Appeal to the People of the World repeatedly emphasizes: "Peace can only be maintained and consolidated through the joint struggle of all peace-loving forces."

The editorial emphasized that as long as imperialism exists, the roots of war cannot be eliminated. The wolfish nature of imperialism cannot and will not change. The imperialists, headed by US imperialism, are frantically engaging in an arms race, exacerbating international tensions, and engaging in conspiracies of war provocation in order to find a way out of their path to destruction. Many facts show that US imperialism is the chief culprit of world reaction, the international gendarme, and the vicious enemy of world peace and humanity.

The editorial said that today, the struggle to defend peace means: maintaining the greatest vigilance against the imperialists' provocative conspiracies, tirelessly exposing the policies of imperialism, sharply watching the schemes of the arsonists of war, and uniting all peace-loving forces to fight. Only by continuously strengthening the solidarity and might of the socialist camp, the bulwark of world peace, while actively developing the workers' movement within capitalist countries, igniting the flames of the national liberation movement even higher, mobilizing all forces opposing the imperialist policies of aggression and war, striking imperialism in all parts of the world, and putting pressure on them, tying their hands and feet, will imperialism not dare to launch a war.

The editorial pointed out that the Appeal to the People of the World calls on the workers and all people of all continents to fight for the relaxation of international tensions and the achievement of peaceful coexistence, against the "Cold War," against the arms race, and for the realization of complete and thorough disarmament. This can only be achieved through active and decisive struggle against the imperialist forces of aggression. The editorial pointed out that the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the socialist countries are actively implementing a peace-loving foreign policy in this direction, based on Lenin's principle of peaceful coexistence. The peace policy of the socialist countries plays a huge role in isolating the imperialist aggressors, uniting all peace forces, and maintaining and consolidating peace.

The editorial emphasized that peace cannot be waited for; peace must be fought for. This appeal from the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries is fully in line with the consistent policy of our Party and the life experience of our people. Today, the reason why it is possible to maintain the armistice and guarantee peaceful construction in our country is only because, under the wise leadership of our Party, a strong revolutionary democratic base has been formed in the northern half; because our people, with the support of the socialist camp and the world peace forces, are actively carrying out the struggle against the war provocation conspiracies of US imperialism; and because the anti-American patriotic struggle in South Korea continues to run high. We must further promote the revolutionary upsurge of socialist construction in northern Korea and further consolidate the material foundation for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. At the same time, in South Korea, we must ignite even higher the flames of the anti-American national salvation struggle of the broad masses of the people in order to force the withdrawal of the US aggressor troops and strive for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, so that the enemy will fall into confusion and have no foothold. Through this common struggle on a world scale, peace-loving people can prevent the imperialists from daring to launch a new war in any region of the world.

However, the editorial went on to say, as the statement of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries pointed out, "If the imperialist madmen launch a war, the people of the world will eliminate and bury capitalism."

The editorial concluded by saying that the Korean Workers' Party and the entire Korean people will further and persistently launch the struggle to force the withdrawal of the US imperialist aggressor troops from South Korea, achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea, and maintain and consolidate peace in Korea, thereby fulfilling the glorious task of the world people's struggle to defend peace and making a contribution to the cause of peace in the Far East and the world.

    战斗的号召
    朝鲜《劳动新闻》12月12日社论摘要
    新华社平壤12日电　朝鲜《劳动新闻》今天发表题为《战斗的号召》的社论说，各国共产党和工人党代表会议告世界人民书和这个会议的声明一道，对有力地鼓舞和动员全世界人民反对帝国主义者的战争政策、进行保卫和平的斗争具有重要的意义。
    社论说，告世界人民书更加清楚地说明了对世界和平的威胁来自以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义者的战争政策的事实，并提出了防止战争和维护、巩固和平的纲领性任务。保卫和平、反对新的世界大战的威胁的斗争，是今天全世界人类最迫切的任务。与此同时，各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议所通过的文件，更加坚定地表示了这样的信心：只要一切反对帝国主义、爱好和平的力量团结起来，进行积极的斗争，就能实现保卫和平所期待的目的。
    社论说，在世界舞台上，社会主义和和平力量更加压倒和超过帝国主义和战争势力，这种力量对比的根本变化，造成了目前帝国主义者的战争挑衅阴谋破产和能够防止战争的现实可能性。但是，这决不意味着和平会自然地到来。正如告世界人民书中一再强调的那样：“只有通过一切爱好和平力量的共同斗争，才能维护和巩固和平。”
    社论强调指出，只要帝国主义存在，战争的根源就不能消除。帝国主义的狼的本性决不能改变，也不会改变。以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义者为了从它那走向灭亡的处境中寻找出路，正在疯狂地进行军备竞赛，加剧国际紧张局势和进行战争挑衅阴谋。许多事实说明，美帝国主义是世界反动的元凶、国际宪兵、世界和平和人类凶恶的敌人。
    社论说，今天，保卫和平的斗争意味着：对帝国主义者的挑衅阴谋提高最大的警惕，不懈地揭露帝国主义的政策，尖锐地注视着战争放火者的阴谋诡计，团结一切爱好和平力量进行斗争。只有不断加强世界和平的堡垒——社会主义阵营的团结一致及其威力，同时积极发展资本主义国家内部的工人运动，更高地燃起民族解放运动的火焰，动员一切反对帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策的力量，在世界各地打击帝国主义，并给它以压力，捆住它们的手脚，帝国主义才不敢发动战争。
    社论指出，告世界人民书号召所有大陆的劳动者和全体人民为缓和国际紧张局势和争取和平共处、为反对“冷战”、反对军备竞赛、实行全面彻底裁军而斗争。这只有通过同帝国主义侵略势力的积极的决定性的斗争才能实现。社论指出，苏联、中华人民共和国和各社会主义国家根据列宁的和平共处的原则，沿着这一方向，积极地执行着爱好和平的对外政策。社会主义国家的和平政策对于孤立帝国主义侵略者、团结一切和平力量、维护和巩固和平起着巨大的作用。
    社论强调说，和平不能等待，和平必须争取。各国共产党和工人党代表们的这一号召，完全符合我们党的一贯的政策和我国人民的生活体验。今天，在我国所以可能维持停战、保障和平建设，只是由于在我们党的英明领导下，形成了北半部的强有力的革命民主基地；由于我国人民在社会主义阵营和世界和平力量的支持声援下，积极进行着反对美帝国主义的战争挑衅阴谋的斗争；由于南朝鲜的反美爱国斗争继续高涨。我们在朝鲜北部要进一步促进社会主义建设的革命高潮，进一步巩固和平统一祖国的物质基础，同时在南朝鲜要更高地燃起广泛人民群众为了使美国侵略军撤走、争取祖国的和平统一的反美救国斗争的火焰，使敌人陷于混乱、无立足之地。通过世界范围的这种共同斗争，爱好和平的人民能够使帝国主义者不敢在世界上任何地区发动新战争。
    但是，社论接着说，如同各国共产党和工人党代表会议声明所指出的，“如果帝国主义狂人发动战争，世界人民将清除和埋葬资本主义。”
    社论最后说，朝鲜劳动党和全体朝鲜人民将进一步顽强地展开使美帝国主义侵略军撤出南朝鲜、达成朝鲜的和平统一、维护和巩固朝鲜的和平的斗争，以此来担负全世界人民的保卫和平斗争的光荣任务，对远东和世界的和平事业作出贡献。
