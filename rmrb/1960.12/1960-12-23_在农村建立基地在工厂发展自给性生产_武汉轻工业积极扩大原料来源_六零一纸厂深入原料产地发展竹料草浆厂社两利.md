Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 21st: Wuhan's light industry and handicraft systems, starting from supporting agriculture, are adopting the method of linking factories and communes to establish raw material bases in rural areas of Hubei, and also developing self-sufficient raw material production. The raw material bases established this year have already begun to provide large quantities of raw materials.

Under the unified leadership and strong support of Party committees at all levels, this year Wuhan's light industry and handicraft departments have established six types of raw material bases in rural areas, including tobacco leaves, barley, hops, reeds, sugar materials, and feldspar; at the same time, they have helped local rural people's communes establish eight factories for paper pulp, match stems, bamboo and wood commodity processing, and food processing. According to incomplete statistics, these bases and processing plants have supplied Wuhan's light industry and handicraft industries with 6,970 dan of tobacco leaves, 1,700 tons of match stems, 7,000 tons of reeds, more than 20,000 pieces of bamboo semi-finished products, as well as large quantities of feldspar, paper pulp, sugar syrup, white wine, fruit jam, and hops. Since the second quarter of this year, Wuhan's light industry and handicraft systems have also launched mass self-sufficient raw material production, and currently 65 factories (workshops) are specifically producing raw materials, with over 93 varieties being produced.

When various places began to establish light industry and handicraft raw material bases, they lacked experience. Relevant departments then held training courses to train technical teams, and selected technical cadres and technical workers to go to the rural raw material bases to provide on-site technical assistance. For example, Hubei Province had no experience in large-scale tobacco leaf cultivation in the past, so Nanyang Tobacco Factory selected more than 100 workers and cadres in June this year to bring technology to the countryside, training more than 5,000 people in rural areas who understood the complete set of technologies from planting and harvesting to baking, enabling 13 counties to start large-scale tobacco leaf cultivation. For food industry raw materials, especially hops for beer production, which had long relied on supplies from other places, relevant departments sent people to Beijing and other places to learn planting knowledge, and invited professors from Huazhong Agricultural College to teach techniques on-site in Tongshan County, E'nan, where hops were being planted, enabling hops to be produced in batches.

The enterprises themselves are producing raw materials, all adopting measures that are appropriate to local conditions and gradually developing from simple beginnings. After Wuhan Leather United Processing Factory decided to produce red alum for leather making in September this year, all the factory workers used waste materials to build factory buildings and manufacture equipment, and worked hard to learn technology. Now it has produced more than eight tons of red alum, ensuring the needs of shoe production. Wuhan "August 1st" Plastics Factory produced 130 tons of bakelite powder this year, which has been used to manufacture more than 100 kinds of daily necessities.

The light industry and handicraft departments are also grasping the present and planning for the long term, grasping both household production and wild resources. Nanyang Tobacco Factory sent more than 500 employees to the countryside to cooperate with the rural autumn harvest and small autumn harvest movement, helping to pick, process, and transport tobacco leaves, and helping the production bases prepare for next year's production. Wuhan Oil and Fat Chemical Factory also organized more than 200 employees to go to the mountains and countryside, and in a short period of time helped rural areas collect and purchase a total of 800 tons of 19 kinds of wild oil materials such as Vitex seeds, Lycoris radiata, and acorns, and also cooperated with commercial departments to establish fixed wild oil material collection and purchase bases.

    Our newspaper reports that in order to solve the problem of raw materials and promote the continuous leap forward in the paper industry, the 601 Paper Mill in Sichuan Province had already made great efforts to build raw material bases and help communes set up raw material processing plants such as bamboo chip plants, and improve transportation conditions before this year. Since the beginning of this year, all the factory workers have further established the idea that the development of the national economy must be based on agriculture. Through vigorously carrying out technological innovation, they have successively extracted more than 200 people, led by the factory director, to go deep into the main raw material bases to carry out technical guidance and procurement work for the processing and production of agricultural and sideline products such as bamboo materials, grass materials, and grass pulp, and to cut and transport raw materials themselves together with the local masses. At the same time, they also used their spare time to help the commune carry out crash agricultural production.

This factory's in-depth operation of "grain and grass" and vigorous transportation not only developed raw material bases and solved the fiber raw materials required for paper making in the factory, but also increased rural economic income. Due to the increase in raw materials arriving at the factory, the output of paper from January to November this year was guaranteed to be 8.33% higher than the same period last year. In the process of vigorously developing transportation, they built more than 100 kilometers of highways, more than 2,000 meters of cableways, and supported the communes with more than 40 sets of carts and carriages, greatly saving transportation labor and directly supporting agricultural production.

### 在农村建立基地在工厂发展自给性生产  武汉轻工业积极扩大原料来源  六零一纸厂深入原料产地发展竹料草浆厂社两利

    在农村建立基地在工厂发展自给性生产
    武汉轻工业积极扩大原料来源
    六零一纸厂深入原料产地发展竹料草浆厂社两利
    新华社武汉21日电武汉市轻工业、手工业系统，从支援农业入手，采取厂、社挂钩办法，在湖北各地农村建立原料材料基地，并且发展了自给性原料材料生产。今年以来建立的原料材料基地已开始提供大量原料。
    在各级党委的统一领导和大力支持下，今年武汉市轻工业、手工业部门，在农村建立了烟叶、大麦、酒花、芦苇、糖料、长石等六种原料基地；同时帮助各地农村人民公社建立了纸浆、火柴梗、竹木商品加工、食品加工等八个工厂。据不完全统计，这些基地和加工厂已供应武汉市轻工业和手工业烟叶六千九百七十担，火柴梗一千七百吨，芦苇七千吨，竹半成品两万多件，以及大量的长石、纸浆、糖稀、白酒、果酱和酒花等。从今年第二季度开始，武汉轻工业和手工业系统还开展了群众性的自给性原料材料生产，目前已有六十五个工厂（车间）专门生产原料材料，生产的品种达九十三种之多。
    各地开始建立轻工业和手工业原料材料基地，没有经验。有关部门就举办训练班，培养技术队伍，并选派技术干部和技术工人到农村原料基地，送技术上门。如湖北省过去没有大量种植烟叶的经验，南洋烟厂今年6月就选拔了一百多个工人和干部带技术下乡，为农村培养了懂得从种植、采收到烘烤等一套技术的五千多人，使十三个县开始大量种植烟叶。食品工业的原料，特别是生产啤酒用的酒花，过去长期依靠外地供应，有关部门就派人到北京等地学习种植知识，并邀请华中农学院的教授到学习种酒花的鄂南通山县实地传授技术，使酒花能成批生产。
    各企业自己生产原料，都是采取因地制宜、因陋就简的办法逐步发展。武汉皮革联合加工厂，今年9月决定自己生产制革用的红矾以后，全厂职工就利用废旧材料建厂房，制设备，努力学习技术。现在已生产出八吨多红矾，保证了皮鞋生产的需要。武汉“八一”塑料厂今年自己生产的电木粉一百三十吨，已用它制造出一百多种日用小商品。
    轻工业、手工业部门还一手抓当前，一手抓长远，一手抓家生，一手抓野生。南洋烟厂派出五百多名职工下农村，配合农村秋收和小秋收运动，帮助采摘、加工和调运烟叶，并帮助生产基地作好明年的生产准备。武汉油脂化工厂也组织了两百多名职工上山下乡，短期内帮助农村采集和收购了黄荆子、石蒜、橡子等十九种野生油料共八百多吨，而且配合商业部门建立了固定的野生油料采集收购基地。
    本报讯　四川省六零一造纸厂为了解决原料问题，促进造纸工业持续跃进，早在今年以前，就大搞原料基地，帮助公社兴办竹片等原料加工厂，改善运输条件。今年以来，全厂职工进一步树立了发展国民经济必须以农业为基础的思想，通过大搞技术革新，先后抽出二百余人，由厂长带队，深入主要原料基地，进行竹料、草料、草浆等农副产品加工生产的技术指导和收购工作，并和当地群众一道，自砍自运原料。同时还利用空隙时间，帮助公社突击农业生产。
    这个厂深入产地大办“粮草”、大办运输，一方面发展了原料基地，解决了厂里造纸所需纤维原料，一方面增加了农村经济收入。由于到厂原料增加，保证了今年1至11月份纸张产量比去年同期增加8.33％。在大办运输中，他们修建了公路一百余公里，索道二千余米，支援公社四十多部架车和马车，大大节约了运输劳动力，直接支援了农业生产。（附图片）
