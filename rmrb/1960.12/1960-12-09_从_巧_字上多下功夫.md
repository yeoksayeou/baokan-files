Put More Effort into the Word "Skill"
　　Jiang Weicai

　　Winter production tasks are quite heavy, but we must also pay attention to combining work and rest, so that the vast number of commune members have enough time to rest, so as to recuperate and prepare their strength, and invest in next year's spring plowing production with strong soldiers and horses, and strive for a great agricultural harvest throughout the year next year.

　　Skillfully doing winter farm work and improving work efficiency is a very good way to both do a good job in winter production and achieve a good combination of work and rest.

　　The Party branch of the First Production Team of Zhouzhuang Commune, in leading winter production, closely relied on the masses and fully launched a mass movement to skillfully do winter work. Not only was winter farm work done better than in previous years, but also commune members had enough time to rest. This is a very good experience. This experience tells us that there is much to be done with skill, and we can start from many aspects. For example, from labor management, tool reform, operation methods, and even various processes, there are many skills to think about and many tricks to dig out. The problem is to mobilize the masses, and study each production project, each process, and each production measure one by one to find skillful ways to do things. They did this, not only doing a good job in winter production, but also ensuring that commune members had enough rest time, thus achieving a combination of work and rest, being good at working and good at resting, and having good production and good rest.

　　The experience of many regions is like this: the more skillful the work, the higher the labor efficiency; the higher the labor efficiency, the better the combination of work and rest. And the better the combination of work and rest, the more comfortable and energetic the commune members are, and the better they can do in production. We must put more effort into the word "skill" in order to do a better job in winter production and arrange our lives and rest better!

    从“巧”字上多下功夫
    姜韦才
    冬季生产任务是相当繁重的，但还要注意实行劳逸结合，使广大社员有足够的时间休息，以便养精蓄锐，准备力量，兵强马壮地投入明年的春耕生产，力争明年全年农业大丰收。
    巧干冬季农活，提高工效，就是既能搞好冬季生产，又能搞好劳逸结合的一条很好的办法。
    周庄公社第一生产队的党支部在领导冬季生产中，紧紧依靠群众，全面开展了群众性的巧干冬活运动，不仅冬季各项农活比往年干得更好，而且使社员有足够的时间休息，这是一条很好的经验。这条经验告诉我们，巧干大有可为，可以从多方面入手。比如从劳动管理、工具改革、操作方法，以至各道工序上，都大有巧法可想，都大有窍门可挖。问题是要发动群众，把各个生产项目、各道工序、各项生产措施一个一个地加以研究，找出巧干的办法。他们这样作了，不但搞好了冬季生产，又保证了社员有足够的休息时间，就做到了有劳有逸，善劳善逸，生产好、休息好。
    许多地区的经验都是这样：越是巧干，劳动效率越高；劳动效率越高，也越能搞好劳逸结合。而劳逸结合搞得越好，社员越是心情舒畅、精力充沛，也就越能搞好生产。我们要在“巧”字上多下功夫，才能把冬季生产搞得更好，把我们的生活和休息也安排得更好！
