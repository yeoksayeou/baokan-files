Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 6th. Shanghai's industrial departments are making every effort to increase the production of more and better daily necessities to supply the people's livelihood needs. Since the beginning of this year, the city's production of daily necessities, including light industrial products, textile industrial products, and some chemical industrial products, has largely increased compared to last year. Among light industrial products, more than 40 products such as bicycles, sewing machines, plastic products, film, artificial leather, watches, and cameras have doubled their output compared to the same period last year. There are more than 300 kinds of daily necessities with improved and stable quality. In the first ten months, the textile, chemical, and light industries also trial-produced more than 24,000 new styles and varieties of products, and so far, more than 14,000 have been put into production.

This year, Shanghai's relevant leading departments, based on the principle of ensuring key projects while also taking care of general needs, have made comprehensive arrangements for the supply of raw materials and transportation equipment for daily necessities, while concentrating a certain amount of strength to support steel production. Daily necessities production units have always adhered to the spirit of hard work and clever work, making full use of existing conditions, and striving to improve and enhance the production of daily necessities. In the past, the Shanghai Bicycle Factory needed a large amount of oxygen to weld various steel pipes for bicycles. Seeing that steel plants used even more oxygen, the workers themselves made a resistance welding pipe machine, which does not require oxygen for welding pipes, saving nearly 10,000 bottles of oxygen a year. In the first eleven months of this year, the factory's output of bicycles increased by 190,000 units compared to the same period last year. Many other factories also produce some raw materials themselves, according to production needs and possible conditions, using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods. So far, the light industry system alone has 66 units producing 57 kinds of raw materials. For example, the output of synthetic detergents in daily-use chemical industrial products increased by 65% in the first ten months of this year compared to last year, after self-producing a batch of auxiliary materials such as sulfuric acid and carbon dioxide.

Many daily necessities factories in Shanghai have also vigorously grasped the conservation and substitution of materials and comprehensive utilization, striving to make more products with the same amount of raw materials. The "three materials" (scrap, edge material, corner material), "three feet" (spice heads and feet, oil feet, soap feet), "four residues" (MSG residue, wheat residue, bran residue, glycerin residue), and "four waters" (black water, mixed water, sewage, electroplating water) that were not fully utilized in the past have recently been recycled and reused by various factories to make many useful products. The United Perfumery Factory comprehensively utilizes various waste liquids and offcuts, adding more than 160 new products, an amount equivalent to two-thirds of all products.

Constantly improving the quality of existing products and trial-producing new products with higher quality, so that the use value of each product is further enhanced, is a prominent aspect of the current increase production and practice economy campaign in Shanghai's daily necessities industry. The textile industry has recently trial-produced a variety of durable textile products. For example, ordinary cotton cloth and knitwear, after chemical treatment, have improved the wear resistance of the fabric. Various printed silks and satins, using reactive dyes and coatings, and also employing some new processes and technologies for special treatment, are also more wear-resistant, wash-resistant, and sun-resistant than in the past. The collar and cuffs, which are most easily damaged on underwear, are made of a combination of chemical fibers and cotton spinning, making them more durable than in the past, saving materials and reducing the burden on consumers. In addition, the new products that the Shanghai textile industry has already produced this year are more than double the total of the past two years. Some factories use a large amount of domestic cotton to produce high-count yarns of 100 counts or more, and weave new products such as willow crepe, checkered glass yarn, and mercerized bath towels. Some woolen mills have produced a large number of multi-heddle fabrics with more than twelve heddles, ultra-thin gabardine, and woolen fabrics such as patterned overcoating. The successful trial production and putting into production of these high-grade new products shows that the technical level of many factories has been further improved.

### 在抓钢铁生产的同时安排一般产品的生产  上海积极增产生活用品

    在抓钢铁生产的同时安排一般产品的生产
    上海积极增产生活用品
    新华社上海6日电　上海工业部门千方百计增产更多更好的生活用品供应人民生活需要。今年以来，全市生产的包括轻工业品、纺织工业品和部分化学工业品在内的日用品，大部分比去年有很大增长。轻工业产品中的自行车、缝纫机、塑料用品、胶卷、人造革、手表、照相机等四十多种产品，产量都比去年同期增加一倍左右。质量提高和稳定的日用品，共有三百多种。头十个月内，纺织、化学和轻工业还试制成功了二万四千多种新花式新品种产品，到目前为止，已经投入生产的共有一万四千多种。
    上海市有关领导部门今年以来根据既要保证重点，也要照顾一般的原则，在集中一定力量支援钢铁生产的同时，对日用品的原料供应、运输设备等方面，也作了全面安排。各日用品生产单位始终坚持苦干巧干精神，充分利用现有条件，努力提高和改进日用品生产。上海自行车厂过去焊接自行车的各种钢管，需要大量氧气。他们看到钢铁厂氧气用得更多，职工群众便自己动手制成一台电阻焊管机，不用氧气焊管，一年可以节省近万瓶氧气。今年十一个月内，这个厂自行车的产量比去年同期增加了十九万辆。还有许多工厂也根据生产的需要和条件的可能，运用土洋结合的办法，自己生产一部分原料材料。到目前为止，单轻工业系统就有六十六个单位自己生产五十七种原料材料。如日用化学工业产品中的合成洗涤剂，经自己生产一批硫酸、二氧化碳等辅助材料以后，今年十个月产量比去年增长65％。
    上海许多日用品工厂还大抓物资的节约代用、综合利用，力争用同样多的原料做出更多的产品。原来没有被充分利用的三料（碎料、边料、角料），三脚（香料头脚、油脚、皂脚），四渣（味精渣、麦渣、糠渣、甘油渣），四水（黑水、混水、污水、电镀水）等，最近都被各厂回收重用，制成了许多有用的产品。联合香料厂把各种废液下脚加以综合利用，增加了一百六十多种新产品，数量相当于全部产品的三分之二。
    不断提高原有产品的质量和试制质量更高的新产品，使每一件产品的使用价值进一步提高，是上海日用品工业当前开展增产节约运动的一个突出内容。纺织工业最近试制了多种耐用的纺织用品，例如普通棉布和针织品，经化学处理后，提高了织物的耐磨程度；各种印花绸缎，采用活性染料、涂料，同时配合运用一些新工艺和新技术加以特种处理，也比过去更耐磨、耐洗、耐晒。内衣上最容易破损的领口、袖口等，采取化学纤维和棉纺交织办法后，也比过去经久耐穿，既可节省物资，又可减轻消费者的负担。此外，上海纺织工业今年已经制成的新产品，也比过去两年的总和还多出一倍多。有些工厂用国产棉花大量生产了一百支以上的高支纱，织成了柳条麻纱、方格玻璃纱、丝光浴巾等新产品。有些毛纺厂大量生产了十二片综以上的多综织物、超薄花呢和拷花大衣呢等毛织物。这些高级新产品的试制成功和投入生产，表明许多工厂的技术水平有了进一步提高。
