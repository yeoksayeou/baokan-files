	Between Light and Heavy
	Chu Yuntian
	The Party branch of the Gaoqiao Production Team held a very meaningful discussion within the branch committee. This discussion can provide a lot of inspiration, especially for production team cadres to consider: After adhering to the “four fixings” of the small team, has the leadership responsibility of the production team been lessened, or has it been increased?

	This involves a person's understanding of objective things, and it must be specifically analyzed; it cannot be said simply that it is "lessened" or "increased." On the one hand, adhering to the "four fixings" further stimulates the initiative of the small team, and the small team can handle many things on its own, so the leadership responsibility of the production team cadres is obviously "lessened." On the other hand, the three-level ownership with the team as the foundation is the fundamental system of the people's commune at the present stage, and adhering to the "four fixings" is one of the main measures to strengthen this fundamental system, which requires a lot of important work. Therefore, the leadership responsibility of the production team cadres is "increased."

	On the one hand "lessened," on the other hand "increased," after weighing the light and heavy, from a general point of view, the leadership responsibility of the production team cadres is still "increased." Since this is the case, why do some production team cadres have the illusion that they "don't need to do any leadership work in the future, just participate in production more"? The reason for this is that these comrades only see one aspect of the problem, and regard the leadership responsibility as a burden with a fixed weight. In their view, things like formulating crop management plans and mobilizing the small team's labor force are all components of the burden. Now that the small team has taken away these "components," don't they have nothing to carry themselves?

	In fact, leadership responsibility is not exactly the same as a burden with a fixed weight. It will never be the case that if the small team cadres carry fifty more pounds, the responsibility on the shoulders of the production team cadres will be reduced by fifty pounds accordingly. Even while fully leveraging the small team's initiative, production team cadres will have many things to do. Taking the Gaoqiao Production Team as an example, after they unified their thinking through discussion, the production team did a lot of effective work in strengthening ideological and political work, in checking and comparing to help the backward catch up with the advanced, and in improving the level of small team cadres and improving the work style of cadres. This proves that leveraging the initiative of the small team will not hinder leveraging the initiative of the production team at all. Moreover, only by fully leveraging the initiative of the small team can the initiative of the production team be better leveraged.

	The three-level ownership with the team as the foundation is the fundamental system of the people's commune at the present stage. Production team cadres standing at this foundational position must recognize their responsibilities, go deep into the masses, go deep into reality, and constantly enrich their experience in their work to complete the glorious tasks they undertake.

    轻重之间
    楚云天
    高桥生产队党支部在支委会里举行了一次很有意义的讨论。这个讨论可以给人很多启发，特别是可以使生产队的干部考虑一下：坚持小队“四固定”，生产队的领导责任究竟是减轻了呢，还是加重了呢？
    这里涉及到一个人对客观事物的认识问题，必须进行具体分析，不能笼统地说是“减轻了”还是“加重了”。从一方面来说，坚持“四固定”，进一步发挥了小队的积极性，许多事情小队可以自己处理了，生产队干部的领导责任显然是“减轻了”。从另一方面来说，三级所有队为基础是现阶段人民公社的根本制度，坚持“四固定”正是为了加强这个根本制度的主要措施之一，要做许多重要的工作。因此，生产队干部的领导责任是“加重了”。
    一方面“减轻”，一方面“加重”，轻重相权之后，从总的方面来说，生产队干部的领导责任还是“加重”了。既然这样，为什么有些生产队干部会产生错觉，以为自己“以后再不用做什么领导工作，只要多参加生产就行了”呢？所以如此，这是由于这些同志只看了问题的一个方面，把领导责任仿佛看成是一副有固定重量的担子。在他们看来，如像制订作物管理计划，调动小队劳力之类的事情，都是担子的组成部分。现在，小队将这些“组成部分”挑去了，自己不是没有东西可挑了吗？
    其实，领导责任和有固定重量的担子，并不完全相同。决不会小队干部多挑五十斤，生产队干部肩上的责任就相应地减少五十斤。就是在充分发挥小队积极作用的同时，生产队干部也会有很多事情可做的。以高桥生产队为例，在他们经过讨论，统一思想以后，生产队在加强思想政治工作方面，在检查评比帮后进赶先进方面，在提高小队干部水平，改进干部作风方面，都做了许多很有成效的工作。这就证明：发挥了小队的积极性，丝毫也不会妨碍发挥生产队的积极性。而且只有充分地发挥了小队的积极性，才会更好地发挥生产队的积极性。
    三级所有队为基础是现阶段人民公社的根本制度。站立在这个基础岗位上的生产队干部，必须认识自己的职责，深入到群众中去，深入到实际中去，在工作中，不断丰富自己的经验，完成自己所承担的光荣任务。
