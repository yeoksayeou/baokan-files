    The Old Model for Twenty Years
    —Record of the Mountainous Area Party Branch Secretary Li Tang's Deeds
    By Our Reporters Sun Shikai, Chen Tong
    The car sped along the highway, and the mountains drew closer. We casually asked a middle-aged man sitting next to us, "How far is it to the Xiguanshang Production Team of Ma'an Commune?" "You're looking for Li Tang, right!" When we nodded with a smile, confirming his guess, the middle-aged man continued excitedly, "He's an old model here. He's been doing revolutionary work since 1938 and has been the party branch secretary for twenty years..."
    Many people on the way were familiar with Li Tang. This aroused our respect and eagerness to visit him even more. We crossed the surging Juma River via the Wudu Bridge and finally arrived at the mountain village surrounded by towering peaks—Fangshan Xiguanshang. When we entered a house at the north end of the village, an elderly man stood up from in front of the smoke-filled stove. His face was covered with wrinkles left by hard work, he wore an old felt hat, and a black cotton-padded coat. This was Comrade Li Tang. He had been named a labor model fourteen times and received eight medals.
    Everything Starts from Reality, Always Victorious
    The Xiguanshang Production Team is located in the mountains surrounded by the Juma River. Here, the mountains are high and the slopes steep, the soil is thin and the rocks are thick, and most of the cultivated land is small terraced fields built with stones along the mountainside, suffering from drought nine years out of ten. How can production be led well under such natural conditions? Over the past twenty years, Li Tang has accumulated an important experience: combining high revolutionary enthusiasm with a realistic and pragmatic spirit. He often says that mastering this point meant winning every battle when fighting the Japanese devils and making revolution in the past, and that it can also lead to increased production year after year. Once, he went to the township for a meeting, and someone suggested opening up the river滩 to grow rice. He thought it was a great thing, but it was necessary to proceed from reality and study it carefully. After the meeting, he walked back alone along the Juma River against the northwest wind, checking around the piles of rocks on the river滩. After careful calculation, it would take at least three thousand workdays to open up this rocky river滩. However, the whole village only had more than sixty laborers. Even if they did nothing else, it would take three winters to complete. This would not only fail to bring benefits that year but also affect other farm work. What to do? He couldn't make up his mind for a while. Later, he looked around at the surrounding mountains and suddenly thought that there was soil in many mountain depressions. If they were opened up into sloping fields, it would save labor and generate income quickly. He rushed back to the village and immediately convened a branch committee to study the matter. Subsequently, a meeting of commune members was held for discussion. After everyone's understanding was unified, three groups were formed to reclaim the land on the mountains. After a winter and spring of hard work, more than fifty mu of terraced fields were opened up, planted with millet and miscellaneous grains, and harvested tens of thousands of catties of grain. Since then, the Xiguanshang Production Team has been reclaiming wasteland every autumn to expand the cultivated area. Seeing that the Xiguanshang's grain production has increased year after year, the commune members in neighboring villages praised: "They have a good secretary!"
    Those who know Li Tang well admire his ability to grasp the right time and place for growing crops. This year's spring was very dry. The plains had already sown corn before Qingming Festival, but they hadn't started yet. Some cadres were anxious and repeatedly urged Li Tang to say, "This year's corn planting will be behind others, hurry up and rush to plant!" But Li Tang said confidently, "Growing crops requires grasping the solar terms, and each region has its own solar terms. Our mountainous area has terraced fields supported by embankments, unlike the soil in the plains, which is like a piece of jade. Planting too early will cause poor germination." When the Xiaoman solar term arrived, he personally took the lead in going to the fields to drain water and plant. Some young people were tired from carrying water to plant, so he sat on the edge of the field and told them about the arduous struggle against the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War to encourage everyone's emotions. In this way, more than two hundred and eighty mu of corn were planted in half a month. As soon as the corn seedlings emerged, Li Tang proposed timely fertilization. At this time, someone objected, saying, "Fertilizing too early, the drought will burn the seedlings to death." He patiently persuaded everyone again, "The coarse fertilizer we apply is both drought-resistant and flood-resistant." After a few days, the commune members saw that the crops were growing green and lush, and they happily said: Our secretary is really an expert in leading production.
    Turning Policies Over to the Masses, Moving Everything
    In the twenty years of grassroots work, Li Tang deeply realized that party cadres must be good at turning the party's policies over to the masses and turning them into conscious actions of the masses. As early as during the Anti-Japanese War, when organizing manpower and materials to support the front, he always made the party's policies known to every household, so that the masses could understand the spirit of the policies and guidelines and consciously and willingly implement them. Now, he leads production in the same way.
    At the beginning of this year, when Li Tang attended the National Agricultural Hero Conference in Beijing, he heard the instructions from the higher authorities that mountainous areas should develop agriculture according to their own characteristics and raise more livestock to quickly change the face of the mountainous areas. He was very happy at the time. After returning to the village, he discussed with the team cadres and decided to implement the "three guarantees and one reward" system, breeding and raising livestock to expand the grazing herds. Then, he reported the benefits of raising more livestock at the meeting of commune members and handed over the method of developing animal husbandry to the masses. Li Tang also personally convened a symposium for shepherds, explaining in detail the significance of implementing contracted weight gain, contracted lamb survival rate, contracted manure accumulation, and rewarding overproduction. He also put forward specific requirements for them. The shepherds were all energized and said they would "catch up" after autumn! Since then, the sheep flocks have expanded from three to six, and the shepherds have been grazing more carefully, occupying sheds in winter and fields in summer, launching a competition to catch up with each other. Shepherd Mu Xiuting was commended for grazing sheep last year and has become even more active this year, grazing on the shady slopes in February and August and on the sunny slopes in December, padding the pen every two or three days, and the sheep manure has filled the field. The forty-six-year-old shepherd Wei Youjin also personally delivered the lambs when the ewes gave birth. In the first nine months, he delivered four pairs of lambs, overproducing eleven. After Li Tang heard about it, he immediately praised him at the meeting of commune members, and he also cashed in the reward and gave him a double reward. In early December, when the production team summarized the year's production achievements, a total of 137 lambs were produced by ewes throughout the year, and 298 contracted sheep gained a total weight of 2,085 catties. The shepherds accumulated a total of 59,000 catties of overproduced manure. With the development of pigs, cattle, and livestock, the income from animal husbandry has accounted for more than 60% of the team's total income.
    Working Diligently and Selflessly for the Public
    Li Tang often said to the party members of the Xiguanshang Production Team: "To engage in revolution, we must be prepared to endure hardship. We endure hardship today so that future generations will not have to endure hardship." This well-trained old branch secretary has maintained the party's style of hard work and simplicity for twenty years.
    People who visit his home for the first time know that his family has nine members, but they cannot see his wife and children. After careful inquiry, they learned that they still lived in the mountains. After the cooperativization, some commune members who had lived in the mountains for a long time moved down the mountains, and others persuaded his family to move down as well. However, he saw that the houses in the village were too crowded, so he let other commune members live there first. His wife and several children still live in a few thatched houses built on the mountainside sixteen years ago. He also said that this has benefits! It also allows our later generations to know the hard life experienced by the older generation, so that they can love today's good life even more.
    Li Tang has always been selfless and devoted to public service. Before the advanced cooperative, because his family had a large population, life was more difficult. But no matter how tired he was, he never asked for subsidies. After the establishment of the advanced cooperative, according to the regulations, branch secretaries, production team leaders, and accountants could each receive a subsidy of 800 work points per year, but Li Tang resolutely refused. One year, due to his many illnesses and busy work, he only did 500 work points for the whole year, which was four-fifths less than others. At the end of the year, when the commune members proposed to supplement his work points according to the regulations, he asked that the work point subsidy be given to the accountant who had more children and less labor. Under the repeated persuasion of the team cadres and commune members, he reluctantly accepted a subsidy of 300 work points. Over the years, whether he went to Beijing or Fangshan County for meetings, he never wanted to receive a living allowance. Once, when he went to Beijing to attend the National Labor Model Conference, the conference gave him ten yuan for pocket money. He thought, "This money was given by Chairman Mao and cannot be spent carelessly." At that time, he used the money to buy daily necessities and stationery. After returning to the village, he distributed these things to team cadres and students, and encouraged everyone to say: "This is Chairman Mao's concern for us, we must work harder to do a good job in production and repay Chairman Mao's kindness."
    Li Tang paid attention to running the team diligently and thriftily in the work of the production team. At a team cadre meeting, someone suggested buying a radio. Li Tang disagreed. He said that the people's commune is large, but there are also many places to spend money. We must live a rich life as if it were a poor life. Now that we have some money, we should first build a few houses for the elementary school so that children and adults have a place to study. Everyone felt that it made sense and agreed with Li Tang's opinion. When the school buildings were built, the team cadres all said: "The secretary's insistence on running the team diligently and thriftily is too right. If we had bought a radio at the beginning, we wouldn't have this place to study today."
    Caring for Commune Members More Than Himself
    In the Xiguanshang Production Team, when talking about Comrade Li Tang's deeds with the commune members, one always hears such praise: "The old secretary not only thought of the masses first during the most difficult period of the Anti-Japanese War, but he is still the same now, caring for the commune members more than caring for himself."
    When it got cold, Li Tang, together with Deputy Branch Secretary Li Gao and Production Team Leader Li Wen, visited the commune members' homes door-to-door to understand whether everyone was prepared to spend the winter well. They found that the cotton-padded clothes of Wei Fuyin, who had been ill for many years, had not yet been made. Li Tang said that such households are one in a hundred, but we cannot ignore them. After he and the team cadres studied it, they reported to the commune to allocate 50 yuan from the public welfare fund to subsidize Wei Fuyin. Once, poor peasant Li Shan went out to work, and his wife gave birth to a child and no one took care of her for a while. After Li Tang learned about it, he discussed with the director of the village women's federation and sent someone to serve her. Afterwards, the commune members joked with him, saying: "You, the branch secretary, even take care of childbirth."
    He cares for the commune members, and the commune members also deeply respect this branch secretary. When Li Tang is sick, everyone goes to other villages at night to invite doctors; when he is too busy, the commune members always persuade him to rest more. One night, he was going to the management area for a meeting. At that time, the river was very big, and some young people asked to send him across the Juma River. Fearing that he could not refuse, he quietly slipped away. But when he arrived at the river, he saw that the young people were already waiting for him.

    Li Tang worked for the landlords since he was a child and suffered all kinds of hardships. In 1937, the Eighth Route Army opened up a revolutionary base here. He was educated by the Party and participated in revolutionary activities in the second year. He gloriously joined the Party in 1940 and soon served as the branch secretary, leading the masses to fight against the enemy, covering revolutionary cadres day and night, transmitting intelligence, and mobilizing manpower and materials to support the front and attack the enemy. At the same time, under the leadership of the Party, he organized the masses to develop mountain production, resist disasters, and survive famine. In 1958, on the basis of the joint village advanced cooperative, he mobilized all the commune members in the village to participate in the people's commune. In production and labor, he set an example in everything, and when he encountered difficulties, he always thought of the masses first. In this way, for twenty years, he has been loved by the masses and has become a red flag in Fangshan County that never fades. (Attached picture)
   Under the leadership of Comrade Li Tang, the commune members of the Xiguanshang Village Production Team have made all production preparations in advance. This is the commune members building embankments and repairing the edges of the terraced fields in preparation for spring plowing.

    二十年的老模范
    ——记山区党支部书记李堂的事迹
    本报记者　孙世恺　陈彤
    汽车在公路上迎风奔驰，群山由远而近。我们随意向坐在身旁的一个中年人请问：“到马安公社西关上生产队，还有多远？”“你们去找李堂吧！”当我们笑着点点头证实他猜对了的时候，这个中年人又兴致勃勃地讲下去：“他是我们这里的老模范，从1938年参加革命工作，干了二十年党支部书记……”
    同路的好多人，谈起李堂来都很熟悉。这更引起我们对他的敬重和迫切访问他的心情。我们沿着汹涌的拒马河穿过五渡桥，才到达崇山峻岭环抱的山村——房山西关上。当我们走进村北头一所房里，从烟火缭绕的灶前站起一位老年人。他的脸上堆满了辛勤劳动留下的皱纹，戴着旧毡帽头，穿一身黑棉衣。他就是李堂同志。他曾经十四次被评为劳动模范，得过八枚奖章。
    样样事从实际出发，无往不胜
    西关上生产队，位于拒马河畔的群山环抱中。这里山高坡陡，石厚土薄，耕地大部分是傍山打埝用石头码起来的小块梯田，十年九旱。在这样的自然条件下，如何领导好生产？二十年来，李堂积累了一条重要经验：高度的革命热情和实事求是的精神相结合。他常说，掌握好了这一条，过去打鬼子闹革命百战百胜，现在领导生产也能连年增产。有一次，他到乡里开会，有人提议开河滩种水稻。他想这是件大好事；但要从实际出发，仔细研究一下。散会后，他迎着西北风，沿着拒马河独自往回走，在乱石成堆的河滩上转圈查看，细细一算：要开出这乱石丛生的河滩，最少得三千多个工。可是全村只有六十多个劳动力，别的活茬不干，也得三个冬季才能完成。这样不仅当年得不到利益，还要影响其他农活。怎么办？他一时拿不定主意。后来，他向四周一望，看到了周围的群山，他猛然想到许多山洼有土，假若开成坡地，既省工又收益快。他赶回村里，立即召开支委会进行研究。随后，又召开社员大会讨论。大家的认识统一后，便组成了三个组上山开荒。大干一冬一春，开出了五十多亩梯田，种上了谷子和杂粮。收获了上万斤粮食。从这以后，西关上生产队每年秋后都开荒，扩大耕地面积。邻村的社员看到西关上的粮食连年增产，都称赞说：“人家有个好支书！”
    深知李堂的人，对他善于掌握天时地利种庄稼的本领，都表示钦佩。今年入春就大旱，平原地区在清明节前，都点种上玉米，唯独他们还没动手。有的干部着了急，再三催促李堂说：“今年种玉米可居下游啦，赶快抢种吧！”李堂却胸有成竹地说：“种庄稼要抓节气，一个地区有一个地区的节气。咱们山区是埝托着的地，不像平川那样一块玉似的土，种早了不爱出苗。”到了小满节气，他便亲自带头下地排水点种。有些青年担水点种累了，他就坐在地头上，给他们讲抗日战争时期对敌艰苦斗争的事迹，鼓舞大家的情绪。就这样，半个月便抢种上二百八十多亩玉米。玉米刚出苗，李堂提议及时施肥。这时有人反对说：“施肥太早，天旱要烧死苗。”他又耐心地说服大家：“咱施的粗肥，既抗旱又抗涝。”过些日子，社员们看见庄稼长得绿油油的，都高兴地说：咱们的书记真是领导生产的能手。
    把政策交给群众，一推百动
    在二十年的基层工作锻炼中，李堂深深体会到，党的干部要善于把党的政策交给群众，变成群众自觉的行动。远在抗日战争时期，组织人力物力支援前线时，他总是把党的政策做到家喻户晓，使群众领会到方针、政策的精神实质，自觉自愿地执行。现在，他领导生产也是如此。
    今年初，李堂到北京参加农业群英会时，听到上级指示山区要根据自己的特点大办农业，还要多养牲畜，迅速改变山区面貌。他当时心里非常高兴。回村后，便和队干部商量，决定实行“三包一奖”，自繁自养扩大放牧群。接着，他又在社员大会上，报告了多养牲畜的好处，把发展畜牧生产的办法交给群众。李堂还亲自召开羊倌座谈会，向羊倌详细说明放羊实行包增重、包接羔成活率、包羊粪积肥和超产奖励的意义，并对他们提出了具体要求。羊倌们个个鼓足了劲，表示要等秋后
  “看齐”！从这以后，羊群由三群扩大到六群，羊倌们放牧得更加精心，冬占棚、夏占场，展开了你追我赶的竞赛。羊倌穆秀庭去年放羊受到表扬，今年更加积极，二八月放阴坡，十冬腊月放阳坡，两三天一垫圈，羊粪积满了场。四十六岁的老羊倌隗有金，在母羊下羔时，还亲手接胎包。头九个月，他一连接了四对羔，超产十一只。李堂听说以后，立即在社员大会上表扬他，并且把奖励兑现，发给他双奖。12月上旬，生产队总结一年生产成绩时，全年母羊共产羔一百三十七只，二百九十八头包产羊共增重二千零八十五斤，羊倌积肥共超产五万九千多斤。加上猪牛牲畜的发展，畜牧收入已占全队总收入的60％以上。
    勤勤恳恳一切为公
    李堂经常对西关上生产队的党员说：“干革命就要准备吃苦，我们今天吃点苦，是为了将来子孙后代不吃苦。”这位久经锻炼的老支部书记，二十年来一直保持着党的艰苦朴素的作风。
    初次到他家中访问的人，知道他全家老少九口人，却看不到他的老伴和孩子。仔细一问，才知道他们原来还住在山上。合作化以后，一些过去长期住在山上的社员都下山了，别人也劝他全家搬下来。可是他看到村里房子太挤，就尽先让其他社员住。他的老伴带着几个孩子，至今还住在十六年前在山腰搭起的几间茅草屋里。他还说，这有好处啊！叫咱后代儿女也知道老一辈经受过的困苦生活，好更热爱今天的好日子。
    李堂一贯克己奉公。在高级社以前，因为他家中人口多，生活比较困难。可是不论工作多累，他从来不要补助。高级社成立以后，按规定支部书记、生产队长和会计等干部，每人每年可补助八百个工分，李堂坚决不要。有一年，他因身体多病，加上工作忙碌，全年才作了五百个工分，比别人少五分之四。到年终决算时，社员们提出按照规定给他补工分，他却要求把工分补助给孩子多、劳力少的会计。在队干部和社员再三地劝说下，他才勉强接受补助三百个工分。这些年来，他不论到北京或去房山县开会，从不肯领生活补助费。有一次，到北京参加全国劳模会，大会发给他十元零花钱，他想：“这钱是毛主席给的，不能瞎用。”当时，就拿这笔钱置了日用品和文具。回村后，他把这些东西都发给队干部和学生，并鼓励大家说：“这是毛主席对我们的关怀，我们一定要更加努力搞好生产，报答毛主席的恩情。”
    李堂在生产队的工作中，时刻注意勤俭办社。在一次队干部会上，有人提议买个收音机。李堂不同意。他说，人民公社大了，可是用钱的地方也多啦，富日子要当穷日子过。现在有些钱，应该先给小学校盖几间房子，让孩子和成年人，都有个学习的地方。大家一听觉得有道理，都同意李堂的意见。当校舍盖起来了，队干部都说：“书记坚持勤俭办社太对啦，当初要是买了收音机，可就没有今天这个学习地方了。”
    关心社员胜自己
    在西关上生产队，和社员们谈起李堂同志的事迹时，总是听到这样的赞扬：“老书记不仅在抗日战争最困难的时期首先想到群众，一直到现在还是那样，关心社员胜过关心自己。”
    天冷了，李堂同副支部书记李高、生产队长李文一起，挨门沿户到社员家中去访问，了解大家准备好过冬没有。他们发现常年患病的隗福印家中的棉衣还没有做好。李堂说，这样家户百不挑一，但我们也不能忽视。他和队干部研究后，报请公社从公益金中拨出五十元钱，补助了隗福印。有一次，贫农李山外出做工，他的妻子生孩子一时没人照顾。李堂知道后，就和村妇联主任商量，派人去伺候。事后，社员们和他开玩笑地说：“你这个支部书记，连生孩子都管。”
    他关心社员，社员们也十分敬爱这位支部书记，李堂有病时，大家连夜到外村去请医生；他工作太忙时，社员总是劝他多休息。一天夜晚，他要到管理区去开会，当时河水很大，有些青年要求送他过拒马河。他怕推辞不掉，就悄悄地溜走了。可是等他到了河边一看，青年们早在等着他了。
                    ×　×　×　×
    李堂从小给地主扛活，受尽了苦难。1937年，八路军在这里开辟革命根据地，他受到党的教育，第二年就参加了革命活动。1940年光荣入党，不久担任了支部书记，领导群众对敌斗争，昼夜掩护革命干部，传送情报，又动员人力物力支援前线，打击敌人。同时，他在党的领导下组织群众发展山区生产，抗灾度荒。1958年在联村高级社的基础上，他又发动全村社员参加了人民公社。在生产劳动中，他事事都作榜样，遇到困难时，又首先想到群众。就这样，二十年来，他一直受到群众的爱戴，成为房山县一面永不褪色的红旗。（附图片）
   西关上村生产队的社员们，在李堂同志的领导下，把一切生产准备工作提前作好。这是社员们在打埝，整修梯田地边，准备明春耕种。
