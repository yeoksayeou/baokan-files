Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou: On November 21st, it was the day for the organized rural market in Xinhua People's Commune, Hua County, Guangdong. Early in the morning, commune members, in groups, flocked to the market from all directions with agricultural and sideline products and handicrafts that were not subject to state monopoly purchase and marketing or part of the state-mandated sales quota. Some carried chickens, ducks, geese, rabbits, and other poultry and livestock of various sizes in their hands, some carried baskets of eggs and buckets of fresh fish and live shrimp, some pushed carts filled with fresh and tender green vegetables, green beans, melons, and other agricultural products, and some carried mountain goods and bamboo and wooden utensils. Before long, they filled the market. The commune members who were trading with each other were bustling, buying and selling, and the scene was very lively. Du, a commune member who recently completed the task of selling poultry to the state commercial department, sold six meat chickens she raised in the market and happily bought back eight chicks, some daily-use industrial products, and small agricultural tools for her own use, and also kept some pocket money. Some public canteens also took the vegetables they grew that they could not finish eating to the market for sale, and the income was used as oil and salt money for the canteen to improve the lives of the commune members.

Xinhua Commune's organized and planned organization of rural market trade facilitates the exchange and adjustment of commodities produced by production teams and commune members, and promotes the development of agricultural and sideline production and handicrafts. In Hengtan Brigade, each household has recently raised an average of more than three chickens, ducks, and geese. In the past, few commune members here raised rabbits. Now, in Xinhua Brigade, households with more than two rabbits account for one-third of the total number of households. In addition, the vast majority of commune members also make full use of small breaks and days off to go to the mountains and lakes to catch wild animals, fish, and shrimp, or weave some bamboo utensils at home to increase their income.

    公社市集的早晨
    11月21日，正逢广东花县新华人民公社有领导的农村市集日。一早，公社社员们便成群结队地带着不属于国家统购统销和完成国家规定交售任务以后的农副产品和手工业品，从四面八方涌向集市。他们当中，有的手里挽着大大小小的鸡、鸭、鹅、兔等家禽家畜，有的提着一筐筐蛋、一桶桶鲜鱼活虾，有的推着装满鲜嫩青菜、青豆、瓜果等农产品的小车，有的扛着山货、竹木器具，不多久，就把集市市场塞得满满的。互相交易的社员，熙熙攘攘，有买有卖，热闹非常。最近完成向国家商业部门交售家禽任务的社员杜女，在集市里卖了自己饲养的六只肉鸡，高高兴兴地买回了八只小鸡、一部分日用工业品和自用的小农具，还留下了一些零用钱。有的公共食堂也把自己种植的吃不完的菜，拿到集市出售，收入作为食堂的油盐钱，改善社员生活。
    新华公社有领导有计划地组织农村集市贸易，便于生产队和社员交换和调剂自己生产的商品，促进了农副业和手工业生产的发展。横潭大队在最近平均每户就多养了鸡、鸭、鹅三只多。过去，这里养兔的社员很少。现在，新华大队每户养二只以上的就占总户数三分之一。此外，广大社员还充分利用小休和公休时间，上山、下湖捕捞野生动物、鱼、虾，或者在家编织一些竹器用具，以增加收入。
