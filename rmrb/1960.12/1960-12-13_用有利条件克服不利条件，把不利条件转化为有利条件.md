    Overcoming Unfavorable Conditions with Favorable Conditions, Transforming Unfavorable Conditions into Favorable Conditions
    Zhao Guodong, Worker of Tianjin Steel Plant No. 3

    The law of the unity of opposites is the fundamental law of the development and change of things. Chairman Mao said: "Everything in the world has a dual nature (that is, the law of the unity of opposites)" ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume IV, page 1190). Our production and work are also like this, containing both favorable and unfavorable factors. These two factors are interconnected and struggle against each other. When unfavorable factors outweigh favorable factors, great difficulties will arise or even lead to failure; when favorable factors outweigh unfavorable factors, work will proceed smoothly and be successful. Therefore, if we want to achieve victory in production and work, we must not one-sidedly see only unfavorable factors or only favorable factors, but comprehensively look at the problem from both sides, find the reasons for the creation of favorable and unfavorable factors, and actively use all favorable factors to overcome unfavorable factors, and transform unfavorable factors into favorable factors.

    What are favorable factors and unfavorable factors? Generally speaking, all factors that can promote the development of our revolutionary cause are favorable factors; all factors that hinder the development of our revolutionary cause are unfavorable factors. For example, in steelmaking, if iron contains a large amount of sulfur, this is an unfavorable factor, because it hinders the transformation of molten iron into molten steel; conversely, limestone promotes the transformation of molten iron into molten steel, so limestone is a favorable factor.

    Favorable factors and unfavorable factors are a unity of opposites. Where there are unfavorable factors, there will be favorable factors. Where there is magic, there is Tao; where there is resistance, there is assistance; whatever pests and diseases there are, there are corresponding pesticides; whatever bacteria there are, there are corresponding bacteriophages. Where there is a problem, there is a solution; where there is a difficulty, there is a way to overcome it. As the saying goes, "One thing conquers another," which is the reason. Therefore, the emergence of each new unfavorable factor is a prerequisite for discovering and creating favorable factors that can lead to its demise.

    Chairman Mao tells us in "On Contradiction": "The permanence of all processes is relative, but this mutability of one kind of process transforming into another is absolute." Since things can be produced, they can also be eliminated. Non-being can be transformed into being, and being can be transformed into non-being; more can be transformed into less, and less can be transformed into more, which is an absolute law of dialectical materialism. Therefore, favorable factors and unfavorable factors can also be transformed into each other under certain conditions. Steel requires a certain carbon content. If the carbon content exceeds a certain proportion, carbon hinders the transformation of iron into steel, and it becomes an unfavorable factor. After steelmaking operations, the carbon content reaches a certain proportion, and carbon becomes a favorable factor in promoting the transformation of iron into steel. It can be seen that for all unfavorable factors, as long as we understand them, take corresponding countermeasures, and through our actual struggle, we can completely transform them or eliminate them.

    Facts have proved that people are not powerless in the face of unfavorable factors. For example, production accidents are an extremely unfavorable factor for increasing production and practicing economy. However, through the efforts of the workers, accidents can be reduced or eliminated. We know that any production accident does not happen for no reason, but has its causes. In the past, one of our comrades in the workshop had five or six incidents of wall collapse and steel running in a single month. Later, after careful analysis by everyone, it was confirmed that this was entirely caused by the gaps in the bricks being too large and the joints not being tight enough. Where there is a reason, there is a solution; by addressing the problem and taking effective measures, the problem was solved.

    We should also look at favorable factors with a connected, dynamic, and comprehensive perspective. Unfavorable factors are often contained in favorable factors. For example, when repairing iron melting furnaces, less adhesive material is placed, which can save effort when building the furnace; but on the other hand, there is a possibility of furnace collapse. If only its favorable side is seen without considering its unfavorable side, the result will be an accident. It is not uncommon for favorable factors to turn into unfavorable factors. Similarly, in unfavorable factors, we can also find various advantages to exploit. In the past, there were two large pools in our workshop filled with broken bricks, which accumulated a large amount of rainwater. This water seeped into the casting pit, causing a lot of harm. Later, we dug a large pit in it, often putting the red-hot molds in, which not only evaporated a large amount of water but also quickly lowered the temperature of the molds, which was a double benefit. Due to the role of people, the transformation of unfavorable factors into favorable factors is common. Originally, every river was an unfavorable factor for people walking and handling affairs, but once people recognized its laws and built various ships, it became a favorable factor in people's transportation. In the past, many sewage rivers in Tianjin were unfavorable factors for people's hygiene and health, but once people changed their course, they became favorable factors for promoting the growth of crops in the suburbs.

    Today, we have established a socialist system. At the same time, after more than eleven years of great construction, especially the continuous Great Leap Forward in the past two years, the socialist material foundation has grown greatly compared to the past. We have 650 million hardworking and brave people, abundant material resources, and especially the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong. As long as we work hard to study Mao Zedong Thought, gradually and deeply grasp objective laws, give full play to people's subjective initiative, and take various active and effective measures to mobilize all positive factors, then any unfavorable factors can be completely overcome.

    用有利条件克服不利条件，把不利条件转化为有利条件
    天津钢厂第三厂工人  赵国栋
    对立统一规律是事物发展变化的根本规律。毛主席说：“世界上一切事物无不具有两重性（即对立统一规律）”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一一九○页），我们的生产和工作也是这样，它也包含着有利和不利两种因素，这两种因素互相联系，互相斗争。当不利因素超过有利因素时，就会出现很大的困难甚至造成失败；当有利因素大过不利因素时，工作进行得就会顺利并获得成功。因而，我们要想取得生产上和工作上的胜利，就不能片面地只看到不利因素或只看到有利因素，而要全面地从两方面看问题，找出造成有利因素和不利因素的原因，并积极地运用一切有利因素去克服不利因素，把不利因素转化为有利因素。
    何谓有利因素和不利因素呢？概括地说，凡是一切能够推动我们革命事业发展的因素，都是有利因素；凡是一切阻碍我们革命事业发展的因素，都是不利因素。例如在炼钢中，铁中含有大量的硫，这就是不利因素，因为它阻碍着铁水转化成为钢水；相反地，石灰石却推动着铁水转化成为钢水，因此石灰石就是有利因素。
    有利因素和不利因素是对立的统一，有不利因素，就会有有利因素。有魔就有道，有阻就有助，有怎样的病害虫，就有怎样的农药，有怎样的细菌，就有怎样的噬菌体。有问题，就有解决的办法，有困难，就有克服的办法。常言说：“一物降一物”，就是这个道理。因而，每一种新的不利因素的出现，都是发现、创造可以致其于死命的有利因素的前提。
    毛主席在《矛盾论》中告诉我们：“一切过程的常住性是相对的，但是一种过程转化为他种过程的这种变动性则是绝对的。”事物既然可以产生，也就可以消灭。无可以转化为有，有可以转化为无；多可以转化为少，少也可以转化为多，这是一条唯物辩证法的绝对规律。因此，有利因素和不利因素在一定的条件下也是可以互相转化的。钢需要一定的含碳量，含碳量超过一定的比例，碳阻碍着铁转化成钢，它就成为不利因素，经过炼钢的操作，使含碳量达到一定的比例，碳就成为促成铁转化成钢的有利因素了。可见，对一切不利因素，只要我们认识了它，采取了相应的对策，并且通过我们实际的斗争，都是完全可以使其转化或将它消灭掉的。
    事实证明，人在不利因素面前不是无能为力的。例如，生产事故，对于增产节约来说，是一个极大的不利因素。但是，经过工人同志的努力，可以减少或消灭事故。我们知道：任何生产事故都不是凭白无故发生的，而都是有着它的发生原因的。过去，我们车间有一个同志曾经在一个月内接连发生过大小五六次卧砖跑钢的事故。后来，经过大家认真地分析，肯定这完全是因为砖的缝隙太大，结口不严所造成的。有原因，就有办法；针对问题，采取了有效的措施，问题就解决了。
    对于有利因素，我们也应当用联系的、运动的、全面的观点来看它，在有利因素中，也往往包含着不利因素。例如，修化铁炉时，粘性物料搁得少，打炉时就可省些劲；但在另一方面，它却会存在着塌炉的可能性。如果只看到了它的有利的一面，而不考虑它的不利的一面，结果就会造成事故。有利因素转化为不利因素的事也不是稀有罕见的。同样，在不利因素中，我们也可以找到这样那样的可乘之便。过去，我们车间有两个积满碎砖的大池子，里边积有大量雨水。这些水渗透到浇注坑内，为害不浅。后来，我们就在它里边挖出了一个大水坑，经常把红热的模子撂进去，既使大量水分蒸发走了，又很快地降低了模子的温度，真是一举两得。由于人的作用，不利因素转化为有利因素的事是屡见不鲜的。原先，每一条河流对于人们的走路办事都是不利因素，可是一旦人们认清了它的规律，造出了各种船只以后，它反而成了人们交通运输上的有利因素了。过去，天津市的许多污水河道，对于人们的卫生、健康是不利因素，可是人们一旦改变了它们的流道，就变成了促进郊区农作物生长的有利因素了。
    今天，我们已经建立起社会主义制度，同时经过十一年多的伟大建设，特别是过去两年的连续大跃进，社会主义的物质基础比过去已经有了很大的增长。我们有六亿五千万勤劳勇敢的人民，有丰富的物质资源，特别是有党中央和毛泽东同志的正确领导，只要我们努力学习毛泽东思想，逐步深入地掌握客观规律，充分发挥人的主观能动性，采取各种积极有效的措施，调动一切积极因素，那么，任何不利因素都是完全可以克服的。
