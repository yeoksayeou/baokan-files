Also attending the banquet were Leonid Brezhnev, member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and Frol Kozlov, member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee and Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, who accompanied Chairman Liu Shaoqi on his visit to Leningrad.

The banquet was held in the banquet hall of the Leningrad City Soviet. At the beginning of the banquet, Smirnov, Chairman of the Leningrad City Soviet Executive Committee, delivered a speech, warmly welcoming the Chinese Party and Government Delegation headed by Comrade Liu Shaoqi.

Subsequently, Chairman Liu Shaoqi spoke at the banquet.

In his speech, Chairman Liu Shaoqi first expressed his gratitude to the party and government leaders and all the people of Leningrad for their warm welcome and generous hospitality to the Chinese Party and Government Delegation.

He said that Leningrad is the cradle of the great October Revolution. The salvo of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism, enabling China's advanced figures to observe and solve the problems of the Chinese revolution from the perspective of Marxism-Leninism, thus beginning a new historical period for the Chinese revolution. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people, after repeated struggles, finally achieved victory in the people's democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, and are now engaged in socialist construction. For this reason, the Chinese people will always remember the great October Revolution and the people of Leningrad who first raised the torch of this revolution.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi pointed out that Leningrad is worthy of being Lenin's city. He said: During the Great Patriotic War, under extremely difficult conditions, you maintained and developed Lenin's revolutionary tradition and victoriously defended this revolutionary holy land. Your heroic and tenacious struggle encouraged the Chinese people in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the anti-fascist people of the world.

When talking about Leningrad's significant contribution to strengthening Sino-Soviet friendship, Chairman Liu Shaoqi pointed out that this is part of the Soviet government and the Soviet people's enormous assistance to China's socialist construction. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, he expressed his heartfelt gratitude and high respect for this internationalist assistance.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi said that now, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people are victoriously realizing the grand seven-year plan for fully developing communist construction. The great Soviet Union has always been a strong fortress of world peace. The Soviet government has made unremitting efforts to safeguard lasting world peace. Not long ago, the Soviet delegation led by Comrade Khrushchev, together with delegations from other fraternal countries, waged a tit-for-tat struggle against imperialism at the Fifteenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, exposing the crimes of imperialism and colonialism, which was beneficial to the people of the world. The Soviet government's various initiatives to ease international tensions, to strive for general and complete disarmament, and to strive for the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems have won the sympathy and support of all peace-loving countries and peoples.

Chairman Liu emphasized that China and the Soviet Union are socialist fraternal countries. The people of our two countries are the closest comrades-in-arms who have undergone long-term tests. In the common struggle against the enemy, we have always shared the same breath and the same fate. The results of this conference of Communist and Workers' Parties have strengthened the unity of the entire communist movement and strengthened the unity between the Chinese and Soviet parties and the two countries. I am deeply convinced that our unity and friendship are as solid as a rock and unbreakable.

He continued, the prospects for the people of all countries to strive for world peace and human progress have never been as bright as they are now. Faced with this great situation, we Chinese people will always unite with the Soviet people, unite with the people of all socialist countries, and in the common struggle against imperialist aggression and in defense of world peace, in the common cause of building socialism and communism, hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and advance from victory to victory.

Chairman Brezhnev also spoke at the banquet. Comrades Kozlov and Tolstikov toasted at the banquet.

In his speech, Brezhnev once again expressed friendly feelings and warm greetings to Chairman Liu Shaoqi, members of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation, and all the Chinese comrades present.

He continued, the Soviet people are sincerely happy about the achievements of the People's Republic of China and are watching with great interest the great and constructive labor of the Chinese people under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China and its Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong. The Soviet people heartily wish the hard-working Chinese people new achievements in socialist construction.

Brezhnev said that under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and its Leninist Central Committee headed by Comrade Khrushchev, our people are selflessly and vigorously realizing the historically significant program of the Twenty-first Party Congress for building communism. We are pleased that the Chinese people give high praise to the Soviet people's heroic labor and achievements.

He said that you have only been guests of the people of Leningrad for two days. However, during this short period, the working people of this glorious and heroic city have fully demonstrated their warm hospitality. This clearly embodies the deep respect and love of the entire Soviet people for the great Chinese people.

He concluded: We will continue to strengthen our fraternal friendship unremittingly in the future. The vibrant strength of this friendship is the unity of our two parties and their loyalty to Marxism-Leninism and prolet

    出席今天宴会的还有苏共列宁格勒市委书记鲍伊科娃、维里日尼科夫、波波夫、列宁格勒市苏维埃执行委员会主席斯米尔诺夫、苏共列宁格勒州委书记托尔斯季科夫、德雷金、波克罗夫斯基、列宁格勒州苏维埃执行委员会主席斯米尔诺夫、列宁格勒军区司令卡扎科夫大将、列宁格勒海军区司令巴伊科夫大将和列宁格勒其他党政负责人以及各界代表。

    宴会在列宁格勒市苏维埃的宴会厅中举行。在宴会开始时，列宁格勒市苏维埃执行委员会主席斯米尔诺夫致词，热烈欢迎以刘少奇同志为首的中国党政代表团。
    接着，刘少奇主席在宴会上讲了话。
    刘少奇主席在讲话中首先对列宁格勒的党政领导同志和全体列宁格勒人对中国党政代表团的热情欢迎和盛情款待表示感谢。
    他说，列宁格勒是伟大的十月革命的摇篮。十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义，使中国的先进人物能够用马克思列宁主义的观点来观察和解决中国革命问题，这就开始了中国革命一个崭新的历史时期。中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，沿着十月革命的道路，经过反复的斗争，终于取得了人民民主革命和社会主义革命的胜利，现在，正在进行着社会主义建设。正因为这样，中国人民永远记着伟大的十月革命，永远记着首先举起这个革命火炬的列宁格勒人民。
    刘少奇主席指出，列宁格勒不愧是列宁的城市。他说：你们在伟大卫国战争时期，在极端困难的条件下，保持和发扬了列宁的革命传统，胜利地保卫了这个革命圣地。你们的英勇顽强的斗争，鼓舞了抗日战争中的中国人民和全世界反法西斯的人民。
    刘少奇主席在谈到列宁格勒在加强中苏友谊方面的重大贡献时指出，这是苏联政府和苏联人民对我国社会主义建设的巨大援助的一部分。他代表中国政府和中国人民对这种国际主义的援助表示衷心的感谢和崇高的敬意。
    刘少奇主席说，现在，苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导下，正在胜利地实现全面开展共产主义建设的宏伟的七年计划。伟大的苏联一直是世界和平的强大堡垒。苏联政府为维护世界持久和平作了坚持不懈的努力。不久前，赫鲁晓夫同志率领的苏联代表团，和其它兄弟国家代表团，在联合国大会第十五届会议上，同帝国主义进行了针锋相对的斗争，揭露了帝国主义和殖民主义的罪恶，这对世界人民是有益处的。苏联政府为缓和国际紧张局势、为争取普遍彻底裁军、为争取实现不同社会制度国家和平共处而提出的各项倡议，获得了所有爱好和平国家和人民的同情和支持。
    刘主席强调说，中苏两国是社会主义的兄弟之邦。我们两国人民是经过长期考验的最亲密的战友。在共同的对敌斗争中，我们一直是同呼吸、共命运的。这一次各国共产党和工人党的代表会议的结果，加强了整个共产主义运动的团结，加强了中苏两党和两国之间的团结。我深信，我们之间的团结和友谊是坚如磐石的，牢不可破的。
    他接着说，各国人民争取世界和平和人类进步的前景，从来没有像现在这样光明。面对着这一大好形势，我们中国人民将永远同苏联人民团结在一起，同社会主义阵营各国人民团结在一起，在反对帝国主义侵略和保卫世界和平的共同斗争中，在建设社会主义和共产主义的共同事业中，更高地举起马克思列宁主义的旗帜，从胜利走向胜利。
    勃列日涅夫主席也在宴会上讲了话。科兹洛夫同志和托尔斯季科夫同志在宴会上祝酒。
    勃列日涅夫在讲话中再一次向刘少奇主席和中国党政代表团团员们和在座的全体中国同志表示友好的感情，并热烈致意。
    他接着说，苏联人对中华人民共和国的成就感到由衷的高兴，怀着极大的兴趣注视着中国人民在光荣的中国共产党及其以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会领导下所进行的伟大的、建设性的劳动。苏联人民衷心地预祝勤劳的中国人民在社会主义建设中取得新的成就。
    勃列日涅夫说，我国人民在苏联共产党及其以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的、列宁主义的中央委员会的领导下，忘我地、朝气蓬勃地实现着具有历史意义的第二十一次党代表大会所规划的、建设共产主义的纲领。我们感到愉快的是，中国人民对苏联人民的豪迈劳动和成就给予崇高的评价。
    他说，你们在列宁格勒人这里作客不过才两天。但是，在这个短短的期间内，这个光荣的、英雄的城市的劳动人民充分表现了他们的热诚好客的感情。这明显地体现了全体苏联人民对伟大的中国人民的深厚的敬意和爱戴。
    他最后说：我们今后仍将不懈地加强我们的兄弟友谊，这种友谊的生气勃勃的力量就是我们两党的团结和它们对马克思列宁主义与无产阶级国际主义的忠诚。
    在宴会进行当中，宾主频频为中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊、为中苏两国党政领导人的健康干杯。
    宴会是在友好、团结和热烈的气氛中进行的。宴会后，列宁格勒的艺术家们作了精采表演。（附图片）
