Conquering Old Barren Mountains by Bravely Clearing Thorns
— A Story of Party Branch Secretary Le Wenzhen Leading Commune Members in Hard Work to Develop Mountainous Areas
Wen Yi Chen Ruihua

Poor Mountain Slopes Transformed into Grain Bins
Beside the Peach Source River, mountains upon mountains,
The appearance of every mountain greatly changed.
An endless view of wheat seedlings,
Terrace upon terrace encircling the mountains.

These verses describe the story of Le Wenzhen, the Party Branch Secretary of the Tongxing Production Team in the Gonghe Management Area of the Mulan Commune in Huangpi County, Hubei Province, who led commune members to study and emulate Luo Huaqing on a large scale, work hard to develop mountainous areas, and change the face of the landscape. The Tongxing Team is located in the remote and barren mountains and ridges beside the Peach Source River. Here, the mountains rise and fall, the land is barren, and coupled with a large population and little land, they had to rely on state grain supplies every year except for 1958. This year, Le Wenzhen led this production team. Heeding the Party's words, she established the ambitious goal of "competing with the mountains for grain," and together with all the commune members, she studied and emulated Luo Huaqing on a large scale, fully utilized the superior conditions of the people's commune, overcame numerous difficulties, and opened up twenty-one barren mountains, rapidly expanding the cultivated land area from 1,310 mu last year to 5,610 mu. The newly reclaimed land was rushed to plant some grain crops in the summer, and despite the drought, this year's total grain output still had a large increase. After setting aside enough grain for rations, seeds, and fodder, they also sold a large amount of grain to the state. Now, all of the team's newly reclaimed more than 4,000 mu of barren land have been sown with wheat. From a distance, the mountains are covered in green, each one more beautiful than the last. Truly, the poor mountain slopes have been transformed into grain bins.

Daring to Revolutionize Against Poor Mountains and Bad Ridges

Le Wenzhen came to the Tongxing Team in April of this year. Initially, she served as the women's team leader and was assigned to the Fourth Team, where the work was relatively backward. People called her the "new bride who just entered the door." This title had a dual meaning: first, she was indeed a new bride who had just married Ren Yong'an in this team; second, she was coming to a place where she was unfamiliar with the people and the land, and she had to take charge of affairs from the very beginning. Like a good new bride who knows how to manage the household, she immediately went to the canteen and took care of the livelihood of the commune members as soon as she arrived at the Fourth Team, making them feel the warmth of the socialist big family. She was also a good hand at work, taking the lead in delivering fertilizer, preparing fields, and organizing bumper harvest areas. With her as a good leader in the team, it only took three short months to change the face of the team and plant the red flag.

Like many people's feelings when they first take on more important work, Le Wenzhen began to feel a little uneasy when she heard that the Party wanted to promote her to serve as the Party Branch Secretary in the production team. Thinking about having to manage thousands of people, she felt somewhat apprehensive: Can I shoulder this burden? Wang Shaoru, the Deputy Secretary of the Management Area who was sent to the team to assist in the work, saw through her concerns and said to her: "The Party and the masses believe that you can shoulder this burden. As long as you listen to the Party, trust the masses, and rely on the masses in everything, you will be able to do anything well."

Back home, Le Wenzhen tossed and turned, unable to sleep. She repeatedly thought: The reason why our Tongxing Team has had to rely on state grain supplies for years is because there is too little land (an average of only one mu of land per person). If every production team in the country reached out to the state for grain like us, how could we build socialism? She made up her mind: She must unite the masses and create a family business in the mountains with their own hands.

In early July, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party promoted Luo Huaqing's experience of reclaiming wasteland, planting more, and harvesting more at the Hengdian Conference in Huangpi, and issued the resounding call of "Every team should learn from and catch up with Minsheng Team, everyone should learn from and catch up with Luo Huaqing." The Party's call was like a beacon, pointing out the direction for Le Wenzhen. During the visit, she walked and thought: We are all under the leadership of the Communist Party. Luo Huaqing has barren lakes, and we have barren mountains. He is a Communist Party member, and I am also a Communist Party member. He dared to reclaim barren lakes and increase grain production. Can't we dare to develop barren mountains and seize grain?

A Thousand Jin Burden Shouldered by Everyone

As soon as Le Wenzhen returned from Hengdian, she convened a meeting of the branch committee, cadres, and poor peasant representatives to discuss the major issue of opening up mountains and splitting ridges. She presented the Party's call to learn from and catch up with Luo Huaqing and the fact that the team had a large population and little land. Everyone was full of energy and unanimously supported the branch's decision to open up mountains for wasteland. Production Team Leader Liu Houzhong guaranteed to her: "You shouldn't worry now. No matter how heavy the burden is, with everyone carrying it together, we can do anything!" Sure enough, "when you pull the vine, all the melons move." After the meeting, everyone went to each team to publicize, and everyone was energized, eager to try. They even finalized the contracting quota overnight. The next morning, Deputy Production Team Leader Xiao Zhongchang and Ren Dajin led the commune members up the mountain. Han Xianyong, a 56-year-old commune member, did not initially understand the importance of opening up wasteland, saying, "You are going to open up barren mountains that even cows don't graze on. Even if you are capable, I don't think you can do anything about it." But the facts finally gave him a profound education. Later, he understood the benefits of expanding the area and worked especially actively. Every day, just as it was dawning, he would automatically go door to door to wake up the young people. He was twice named a model of the production team.

Always Taking the Lead

In the face of the great power of the masses, one barren slope and rocky ridge after another was reclaimed. In order to seize the opportunity to expand the wasteland area before the autumn planting, Le Wenzhen got up early and went to bed late every day, working ahead of everyone and finishing work after everyone, taking the lead in everything. When developing Yanzishan Mountain, they dug up the soil and saw that it was very good black sandy soil, and the commune members were all overjoyed. Unfortunately, this was a vicious mountain that no one had ever dared to enter. The mountain was densely covered with thorns, snakes and insects roamed, and hornets were menacing. How easy would it be to develop it! A group of female shock troops swung their hoes towards the thorn forest, alarming the insects that occupied the mountains. For a time, snakes came out and wasps chased, scaring everyone back. Ren Daming, a rich middle peasant, had just set up the plow on the edge of the mountain and helplessly shook his head and walked away. Le Wenzhen insisted on not retreating and kept working hard. The retreating team members saw her tenacious energy and did not pay attention to the snakes, insects, and thorns. They encouraged each other to move forward. After all, the insects were afraid of people. The harder they worked, the faster those guys slipped away.

Le Wenzhen has the great ambition to conquer poor mountains and evil ridges, and she has inexhaustible strength and wisdom. Not afraid of the difficulty of opening up Yanzishan Mountain, they cut thatch and burned the thorns, snakes, and insects to ashes. Ren Daming, who was plowing the fields, ran away, and then they invited an old expert. When there were not enough people, they organized twenty or so women to learn how to plow the fields. In this way, many plows and hoes were worn out, but people became more and more energetic. They sprinkled sweat all over the mountain and finally opened up twenty-one rugged barren mountains and planted crops. Seeing the mountains of lush and thriving wheat seedlings that they had cultivated with their own hands, the commune members were all smiles. They said: The new bride who came to the team is not simple. Our mountainous area has a great future!

    披荆斩棘征服老荒山
    ——记党支部书记乐文珍领导社员艰苦建设山区的故事
    闻毅　陈瑞华
    穷山坡变成了粮窝窝
    桃源河边山连山
    山山面貌大改观
    满眼麦苗望不尽
    梯梯层层绕山盘
    说的是湖北黄陂县木兰公社共和管理区同兴生产队党支部书记乐文珍，领导社员大学大赶罗华清、艰苦建设山区、改变面貌的故事。同兴队在桃源河边贫瘠偏僻的荒山野岭间，这儿群山起伏，土地贫瘠，加上人多田少，除1958年以外，年年都要靠国家供应粮食。今年，乐文珍领导了这个生产队。她听党的话，树立了“与山争粮”的雄心大志，和全体社员一道，大学大赶罗华清，充分利用人民公社的优越条件，战胜重重困难，开出荒山二十一座，使耕地面积从去年的一千三百一十亩迅速扩展为五千六百一十亩。新开的荒地在夏季就抢种上了一部分粮食作物，尽管遇上了干旱，今年粮食总产量仍然有很大的增长，留足了口粮、种子、饲料，还向国家出卖了大量粮食。现在这个队新开的四千多亩荒地全部都播种上了麦子，远远望去，满山都披上了绿装，一座美似一座，真个是穷山坡变成了粮窝窝。
    敢向穷山恶岭革命
    乐文珍是今年4月到同兴队来的，初来时任妇女队长，分配在工作比较落后的四小队，人们称她是“刚过门的新媳妇”。这个称呼含有双重意味：一来她的确是刚和这队里的任永安结婚的新娘；二来她是来在一个人生地不熟的地方，一开始便要当家理事。就像一个会理家的新媳妇一样，她一来到四小队，马上就下食堂，抓生活，让社员们感到社会主义大家庭的温暖。她干活也是把好手，送肥整田，办丰产畈，她都带头地干。小队里有了她这个好当家人，只短短三个月，便改变面貌，并插上了红旗。
    像很多人初次担负较重要的工作时的心情一样，乐文珍开始听说党要提拔她到生产队里担任支部书记。想到要去当千把人的大家，心里总有些忐忑不安：这个担子我挑得起吗？派到队里来协助工作的管理区副书记王少儒看穿了她的心事，对她说：“党和群众相信你挑得起这副担子，只要听党的话，相信群众；处处依靠群众，什么事情都会干得好的”。
    回到家里，乐文珍翻来复去的睡不着觉，她一遍一遍地思考着：我们同兴队所以历年要国家供应粮食，就是因为田地太少
  （平均每人只有一亩田），如果全国的每个生产队都像我们这样伸手向国家要粮食，那怎能建设社会主义呢？她下定决心：一定得把群众团结起来，用自己的双手，在山区创建出一份家业来。
    7月初，中共武汉市委在黄陂横店会议上推广了罗华清开荒、多种、多收的经验，并发出了“队队学赶民生队，人人学赶罗华清”的响亮号召。党的号召像一盏指路明灯给乐文珍指出了方向。参观时，她一面走，一面想：都是共产党领导，罗华清有荒湖，我们有荒山，他是共产党员，我也是共产党员，他敢开垦荒湖、增产粮食，难道我们就不敢开发荒山，夺得粮食吗？
    千斤担子众人挑
    乐文珍一从横店回来，就召集支委、干部和贫农代表商量开山劈岭的大事。她把党号召学赶罗华清和本队人多田少的事实一摆，个个浑身是劲，一致拥护支部上山开荒的决定。生产队长刘厚忠向她保证说：“你现在该不耽心了吧，再大的担子，有我们大家一起担，什么事情都干得出来！”果然“牵起藤儿瓜都动”，开会过后，大家又分头到各小队一宣传，人人精神振奋，摩拳擦掌，连夜订好了包工定额，第二天一大早，生产队副队长萧忠昌和任大金就带领各路社员上了山。五十六岁的社员韩先勇，刚开头还对开荒没有认识，说什么：“从来连牛吃草都不去的荒山，你们偏要去开，那怕你们有本事，我看也把它没有办法”，但事实终于使他受到了深刻的教育，到后来他也明白扩大面积的好处了，劳动得特别积极，每天天刚发亮，就自动地挨门挨户喊年轻人起床，两次被评为生产队的模范。
    处处打头阵
    在群众的巨大的力量面前，荒坡石岭一座接着一座地被开垦出来。为了在秋播前抢住开荒面积，炎天暑热，乐文珍天天起早睡晚，出工在人前，收工在人后，事事带头干。在开发燕子山时，挖开土一看，是蛮好的黑沙土，社员们无不欢欣鼓舞。可惜这是一座从来都没人敢进去的恶山，山上荆棘簇密，蛇虫横行，黄蜂逼人，要开发它，谈何容易！一部分妇女突击队员抡起镢头往棘林挥去，惊动了霸占山岭的虫豸，一时蛇出蜂追，吓得大家直往后退。富裕中农任大明在山边刚架开犁，就无可奈何地摇头走开了。乐文珍坚持不退，一个劲地干下去。退下去的队员看到她这股顽强劲，也不把蛇虫恶刺放在眼下，相互鼓励着向前劈去。到底还是虫怕人，他们干的越猛，那些家伙也就溜得越快。
    乐文珍心中有征服穷山恶岭的大志，身上就有用不完的力气和使不尽的智慧，不怕燕子山难开，她们割来茅草，把荆棘蛇虫烧个精光。犁田的任大明跑了，再去请来个老把式，人手不够，又组织二十几位妇女学犁田。就这样，犁头和镢头都磨损了好些把，而人却越干越猛，在山上撒遍了劳动汗珠，终于把二十一座崎岖荒山开垦出来，种上了庄稼。看到自己用双手开劈、培育出来的一山一山葱绿、茁壮的麦苗，社员们无不喜笑颜开，他们说：队里来的新媳妇不简单，我们山区是大有奔头了！
