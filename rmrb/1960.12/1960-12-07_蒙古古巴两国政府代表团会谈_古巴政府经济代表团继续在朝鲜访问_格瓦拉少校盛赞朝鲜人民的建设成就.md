Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, December 6th: The Cuban government delegation, headed by Hector Rodriguez Llompart, Administrative Vice Minister of the Cuban Revolutionary Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Mongolian government delegation, headed by Mongolian Foreign Minister P. Shagdarsuren, held talks here today.

Yesterday evening, the Cuban government delegation also held talks on trade issues with the Mongolian delegation, headed by B. Baturga, First Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade of Mongolia.

This morning, the Cuban government delegation visited the Central Museum in Ulaanbaatar, and in the afternoon, they watched a sports performance and visited a shoe factory and a woolen mill.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 6th: The Cuban Revolutionary Government Economic Delegation, led by Major E. Che Guevara, President of the National Bank of Cuba, continued its tour in Hamhung and Pyongyang on the 4th and 5th, accompanied by Korean Minister of Finance Han Sang-doo and others, and was warmly welcomed by the Korean people everywhere.

On the 4th, the delegation visited factories and agricultural cooperatives in the Hamhung area. Major Guevara praised the Korean people for their achievements when he visited the Hungnam Fertilizer Factory, which was destroyed by U.S. imperialism during the war and has now been restored by the heroic Korean working class into a magnificent, fully mechanized, and automated factory.

Major Guevara wrote in an inscription after visiting the Ryongsong Machine Factory that this factory once again proves the strong spirit of the Korean people in building socialism under the leadership of their great leader, Premier Kim Il-sung.

The Cuban delegation also visited the construction site of the Vinylon Chemical Fiber Factory, the Heungsang Pottery Factory, and the Choyang Agricultural Cooperative in Hamju County, Hamgyongnam-do on the 4th. During their visit to this agricultural cooperative, which had a bumper harvest this year, the Cuban guests expressed their happiness at the rapid improvement in the living standards of Korean farmers after collectivization.

Major Guevara said at a banquet held by Park In-ha, Chairman of the People's Committee of Hamgyongnam-do, on the evening of the 4th, that I did not imagine that Korea, which had been ruled by Japanese imperialism and suffered the ravages of the most brutal war in history launched by U.S. imperialism, would be so strong today.

He said that this proves the correctness of the policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry for the development of an independent national economy and the strength of the socialist camp. This proves the correctness of the leadership of your leader, Marshal Kim Il-sung, and the Workers' Party of Korea.

On the 5th, the Cuban delegation visited the large-scale Heechon Machine Tool Factory and the Pyongyang Textile Factory, which have modern equipment.

When Major Guevara and other Cuban guests arrived in Heechon by special train, many workers, workers' families, and students welcomed the Cuban guests warmly at the station with Korean and Cuban flags and bouquets.

After visiting the Heechon Machine Tool Factory, Major Guevara said, "I was deeply moved by this factory today. You overcame all difficulties in the face of the enemy's brutal bombing and built such a modern factory. This shows us your strong will and determination to achieve your goals and is a very good example for us."

After visiting the Heechon area, Major Guevara and others returned to Pyongyang. That evening, they also visited the Pyongyang Textile Factory.
