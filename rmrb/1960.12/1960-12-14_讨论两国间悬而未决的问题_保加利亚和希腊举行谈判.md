Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, December 12th - According to the Athens radio station on the 5th, Bulgarian and Greek delegations began negotiations on the 5th at the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss outstanding issues between the two countries.

The head of the Bulgarian delegation participating in the negotiations was Nikola Gavrilov, Bulgarian Ambassador to the United Arab Republic and Minister to Sudan. The head of the Greek delegation was Plenipotentiary Minister Constantine Himarios. Prior to the negotiations, the Bulgarian News Agency issued a statement regarding the holding of the negotiations. The statement said that the Bulgarian government had repeatedly suggested resolving some outstanding issues between Bulgaria and Greece through negotiations, but the negotiations had not been held due to unacceptable conditions put forward by the Greek side. It was not until recently that the Greek side abandoned these conditions, and the two sides reached an agreement to hold negotiations.

    新华社12日讯　据保加利亚通讯社索非亚讯：雅典电台5日宣布：保加利亚和希腊两国代表团于5日在希腊外交部开始举行谈判，讨论两国之间悬而未决的问题。
    参加谈判的保加利亚代表团团长是保加利亚驻阿联大使兼驻苏丹公使尼古拉·加夫里洛夫，希腊代表团团长是全权公使康斯坦丁·希马里奥斯。谈判举行前，保加利亚通讯社曾就举行谈判发表一项声明。声明说，保加利亚政府过去多次建议通过谈判来解决保希两国之间的一些悬而未决的问题，但是由于希腊方面提出不能接受的条件，谈判一直未能举行。直到最近希腊方面才放弃了这些条件，双方才达成举行谈判的协议。
