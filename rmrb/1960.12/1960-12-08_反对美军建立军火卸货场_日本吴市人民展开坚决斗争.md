    Opposing the U.S. Military Establishing an Arms Unloading Depot
    Japanese Kure City Residents Launch Resolute Struggle
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 6th. News: Citizens of Kure City, Japan, have launched a large-scale mass struggle, resolutely opposing the U.S. military establishing an arms unloading depot at the Kure City port docks.
    According to the *Akahata* report, to date, 80,000 Kure City residents (equivalent to two-thirds of all voters) have signed petitions against the U.S. military setting up an arms unloading depot.
    Today, Kure City residents sent four representatives to the Diet and relevant government authorities to express their firm opposition to the establishment of a U.S. military arms unloading depot in Kure City port. When the citizen representatives arrived at the Diet, Communist Party members of the Diet received them.
    The representatives subsequently visited organizations such as the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the Peace Committee, and the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, requesting their support for the struggle of the Kure City residents.
