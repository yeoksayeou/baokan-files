At the morning session today, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko delivered a report on the international situation and Soviet foreign policy. The meeting then discussed the issue of Soviet foreign policy and unanimously passed a resolution endorsing the Soviet government's foreign policy.

Soviet party and government leaders, headed by Khrushchev, attended today's meeting.

Diplomatic envoys from various countries to the Soviet Union also attended the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 22nd: TASS Moscow reports: The Soviet Supreme Soviet session concluded its discussion on the draft plan for the development of the Soviet national economy for 1961 and the draft national budget for 1961 on the morning of December 22nd.

Afanasyev, a representative from the Magadan Oblast, said at the evening session on the 21st that the northeastern border regions of the Soviet Union are continuing to be vigorously developed. He said that Soviet scientists and experts have concluded that the mineral deposits on the Chukchi Peninsula are much richer than those in Alaska, across the Bering Strait.

Batiyev, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, said at the meeting that the main oil-producing region of the Soviet Union, Tatarstan, had completed its annual plan half a month ahead of schedule. Now, the republic can provide millions of tons of liquid fuel every year.

Kucherenko, Chairman of the Soviet State Construction Committee, said that the resolution that has been passed to industrialize Soviet industrial construction stipulates that in the next four years, 160 enterprises will be built to produce complete sets of reinforced concrete structures for industrial buildings. After the completion of this plan, we will be able to carry out construction of about 20 million square meters of production area annually using highly industrialized methods.

Yelyutin, Minister of Higher and Secondary Specialized Education of the Soviet Union, said that the vigorous development of education in the various Soviet republics, especially in the eastern states of the Soviet Union, is an extremely glorious page in the history of world culture.

Mammadaliyev, President of the Azerbaijan Academy of Sciences, said, "We Soviet scientists demand: do not use the amazing achievements of human genius to destroy people." He said, "We hope that the budgets of all countries will follow the example of the Soviet budget and become budgets for peace, people's prosperity, and happiness."

Zagafranov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, said at the morning session of the Nationalities Council on the 22nd that Bashkir's industry, especially the oil industry, is developing at a high speed.

Novikov, Minister of Power Station Construction of the Soviet Union, said that the amount of power generation capacity added by the Soviet Union every year is almost twice as much as the power generation capacity stipulated in the famous Russian State Electrification Plan.

Novikov said that in the next year alone, the Soviet Union's power generation capacity will increase by 7.8 million kilowatts. He said that 1961 will be a year of unprecedented development of Soviet power. The large-scale construction of a number of the world's largest thermal power plants, each with a power generation capacity of 2.4 million kilowatts, will begin.

Novikov said that it has been decided to start the construction of two large hydropower stations -- the Kyiv Hydropower Station (Ukraine) and the Nurek Hydropower Station (Tajikistan). Speaking about the role of the Nurek Hydropower Station, he said that this hydropower station is not only of great significance to the power resources of Soviet Central Asia, but it can also irrigate more than one million hectares of fertile arid land in Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan.

In the meetings held separately by the Union Council and the Nationalities Council for three days, a total of 64 representatives spoke on the draft plan for the development of the Soviet national economy for 1961 and the draft national budget for 1961.

Novikov, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Soviet State Planning Committee, and Garbuzov, Minister of Finance of the Soviet Union, made concluding remarks at the joint session of the two houses, the Union Council and the Nationalities Council, on the evening of the 22nd. Novikov pointed out that the draft plan for the development of the Soviet national economy for 1961 submitted to the meeting for discussion has received unanimous support and complete approval from the representatives. The government will study the suggestions and opinions put forward in the conclusions of the budget committees of the two houses and the economic committee of the Nationalities Council, as well as the suggestions and opinions put forward by the representatives, and make corresponding resolutions.

The Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting on the 22nd unanimously passed the Law on the State Budget of the Soviet Union for 1961, the Law on the Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the Soviet Union for 1961, and the Resolution on the Approval of the Implementation of the State Budget of the Soviet Union for 1959.

The 1961 budget stipulates that the total revenue is 78,993,741,000 rubles, and the total expenditure is 77,589,829,000 rubles (all of the above are in new currency).

At the meeting on the 22nd, Yatega Nasreddinova and Georgy Dzotsenidze were newly elected as Deputy Chairmen of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and some decrees promulgated by the Presidium between the two meetings were approved.
