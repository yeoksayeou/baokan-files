Xinhua News Agency, December 28th: This year, China's agricultural production suffered the most severe natural disasters in nearly a century. Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses waged a tenacious struggle against the disasters and achieved tremendous achievements. They are now full of confidence in overcoming the difficulties brought about by the disasters, actively carrying out winter production, comprehensively arranging their lives, and striving for a better harvest next year.

In 1960, 900 million mu of farmland in China were affected by disasters of varying degrees, accounting for more than half of the total cultivated area. Among them, 300 to 400 million mu of farmland were severely affected, and some farmland did not even yield a harvest due to particularly severe disasters.

This year's disaster occurred after 600 million mu of farmland nationwide were affected by disasters in 1959, making the situation even more serious.

The most severe disaster this year was drought. Except for Tibet, which was not affected, and Xinjiang, where the climate was very abnormal but did not result in a disaster, all other provinces and autonomous regions experienced droughts of varying degrees, affecting 600 million mu of farmland. The droughts mainly occurred in the spring and summer seasons. Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and other provinces and autonomous regions suffered continuous droughts in the spring and summer. Parts of Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and other provinces also experienced drought in the summer. Among the drought-affected areas, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces had the largest drought-affected areas, accounting for more than 60% of the total cultivated area of the four provinces. The drought lasted the longest, generally six to seven months. Some places, such as Linxian and Changge in Henan, experienced drought for more than a year. At the height of the spring and summer droughts, eight of the twelve major rivers in Shandong Province, including the Wen River and the Wei River, dried up. The lower reaches of the Yellow River, such as Jinan and Fanxian, dried up or almost dried up for more than forty days in March and June, and people could wade across the river.

This year's typhoons and floods were also very serious, affecting twenty provinces and autonomous regions, with the three northeastern provinces and the coastal provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangsu, and Shandong being the most severely affected. The eastern regions of Liaoning Province even encountered an unprecedentedly severe flood, according to local hydrological records. This year's floods were mainly caused by frequent and strong typhoons. The number of typhoons making landfall in China this year was the highest in the past fifty years, with a total of eleven typhoons making landfall from June to October. The passage time of the typhoons was very long, generally lasting about ten hours, with the longest lasting more than twenty hours. The movement patterns of the typhoons after landfall this year also changed. In the past, typhoons generally moved northwest after landfall, and moving northwest not only reduced wind speed due to the many high mountains, but also brought rainfall to the area. This year, typhoons generally moved straight north after landfall, not only maintaining their intensity but also causing drought in the west and flooding in the east.

Due to the impact of droughts and floods, serious diseases and insect pests occurred in large areas of Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Anhui, Liaoning, and other provinces. Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Anhui, Shandong, and other provinces also suffered frequent and severe hailstorms and frosts.

The above-mentioned natural disasters occurred repeatedly and alternately in many areas. For example, in Changwei, Linyi, Qingdao, and other areas of Shandong Province, after a severe spring drought, they suffered continuous torrential rains in the summer, and also experienced multiple hailstorms and large-scale insect pests.

Under the leadership of the Party, the people in the disaster-stricken areas waged a heroic and tenacious struggle against the natural disasters. In some areas lacking water sources, cadres and the masses climbed cliffs dozens or hundreds of feet high, built aqueducts, and dug tunnels to find and divert water. Many drought-affected farmlands failed to sprout after the first sowing, so they sowed a second time. If that didn't work, they sowed a third time. Some were repeatedly re-sown five or six times, and some even had "five-flower fields" where multiple crops grew in one field. Make up for spring losses in summer, make up for paddy field losses with dry land, make up for grain losses with melons and vegetables, make up for the autumn harvest with a "small autumn harvest"—this is the policy resolutely implemented by many communes.

The people's communes in various places demonstrated great superiority in the fight against disasters. They promptly mobilized manpower and materials, rationally used water sources, organized the cooperation of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and comprehensively arranged the lives of commune members, thus greatly enhancing the disaster relief efforts. The large and small water conservancy projects built by the state and the people's communes over the past few years have played a significant role in the fight against drought and flood. Many elderly farmers who remember the tragic situation of disasters before liberation said, "If it weren't for the people's communes in such a disaster-stricken year, who knows how many people would have died!"

After achieving a great victory in the fight against disasters, the leading organs in various places dispatched hundreds of thousands of cadres to go deep into the grassroots, share weal and woe with the masses, eat, live, work, and discuss things together, grasp production with one hand and life with the other, and actively lead the masses in overcoming famine and the difficulties brought about by the disasters. Now, the disaster areas have completed the sowing of overwintering crops and expanded the planting of a large number of early-maturing crops and vegetables. More than 40 million mu of overwintering vegetables have been planted across the country, an increase of 10 million mu compared with last year. In many areas across the country, overwintering crops such as wheat, barley, naked barley, rapeseed, and green manure are growing neatly and vigorously due to better sowing quality. In some areas, due to the impact of disasters, there are more late-sown wheat and third-class seedlings. These areas have adopted many seedling management methods to try their best to make the late-sown wheat catch up with the early-sown wheat, and the third-class seedlings catch up with the first-class seedlings. Now, all localities are focusing on winter irrigation and topdressing, strengthening winter field management, and stepping up efforts in fertilizer accumulation, winter plowing, repairing farm tools, repairing irrigation canals, and preparing the land. They are also widely carrying out winter sideline production in accordance with local conditions, striving for a better harvest in 1961.

In order to make good arrangements for the lives of commune members this winter and next spring, various localities are strengthening the leadership and management of public canteens, practicing careful calculation, supplementing the canteens with insufficient grain with melons and vegetables, and making comprehensive and specific arrangements for commune members' winter heating, labor, and rest.

In order to protect livestock from safely overwintering, people's communes in various places are also mobilizing the masses to collect and store forage and feed needed for livestock to overwinter, and to repair livestock pens and sheds. In Liaozhong, Liaoyang, Xinmin, and five other heavily affected counties in Liaoning Province, more than 16 million jin of wild feed and more than 264 million jin of forage were stored before winter, and livestock sheds were repaired.

    我国农业生产今年遭受特大天灾
    六亿人民满怀信心克服严重困难
    一半以上农田受到程度不同灾害其中三至四亿亩遭重灾
    公社抗灾大显优越性现正抓紧冬季生产争取明年好收成
    新华社28日讯　我国农业生产今年遭受了近百年来没有过的严重自然灾害，广大群众在党的领导下进行了顽强的抗灾斗争，取得了巨大成就，现正满怀信心地克服灾害带来的困难，积极开展冬季生产，全面地安排生活，争取明年有较好的收成。
    1960年我国有九亿亩农田受到程度不同的灾害，占总耕地面积一半以上。其中有三亿亩到四亿亩农田，遭到重灾，甚至有一部分农田因灾害特别严重没有收成。
    今年的灾害是在1959年全国有六亿亩农田受灾后继续发生的，因此灾情更加严重。
    今年灾情最重的是旱灾。全国除西藏地区没有受灾，新疆地区虽然气候很不正常，但是没有成灾以外，其余各省、自治区都先后发生了程度不等的干旱，受旱农田达六亿亩。干旱主要发生在春、夏两季。河北、河南、山东、山西、陕西、内蒙古、甘肃、四川、云南、贵州、广东、广西、福建等省、区，曾在春夏两季连续遭到干旱，江苏、安徽、浙江、湖北、湖南、江西等省的部分地区在夏季也发生了旱灾。受旱地区中以河北、河南、山东、山西四省受旱面积最大，占四省总耕地面积的60％以上，时间最长，一般干旱六、七个月。有的地方如河南林县、长葛等地连旱一年多。在春旱和夏旱最严重的时候，山东省境内的十二条主要河流中，有汶河、潍河等八条河断流，黄河下游济南、范县等河段，在3月和6月有四十多天断流或几乎断流，人可以涉水过河。
    今年台风和洪涝灾害也很严重，有二十个省和自治区受灾，以东北三省和沿海的广东、福建、江苏、山东等省为最重。辽宁省东部地区更遭遇了当地水文记录上从来未有过的特大洪水灾害。今年的水涝灾害，主要是由于频繁、强烈的台风引起的。今年台风在我国登陆的次数，是五十年来台风在我国大陆登陆次数最多的一年，从6月到10月共有十一次。登陆台风过境时间都很长，一般长达十小时左右，最长的达二十个小时以上。今年台风登陆后的运动规律也发生了变化。以往台风登陆后一般都是向西北方运动，朝西北方运动不仅要被许多高山峻岭削减风速，而且也把雨量带给这一带地区；今年台风登陆后一般是向北直上，不仅一直保持着台风的强度，而且又造成东涝西旱。
    由于旱涝灾害的影响，山东、河南、江苏、安徽、辽宁等省大片地区都发生了严重的病虫灾。陕西、山西、河北、安徽、山东等省还遭受了频繁和严重的冰雹、霜冻。
    上述自然灾害在许多地区是反复交错发生的。如山东省昌潍、临沂、青岛等地区，在春季大旱之后，又在夏季连续遭受暴雨，同时发生多次冰雹和较大面积的虫害。
    受灾地区的人民在党的领导下，同自然灾害作了英勇顽强的斗争。有些缺乏水源的地区，干部和群众为了发掘水源，爬上人迹不到的几十丈、几百丈高的悬崖，架渡槽，挖隧洞，开源引水。许多受旱的农田一次播种不出苗，就种第二次，两次不行再种第三次，有一些反复补种了五、六次，甚至出现了一田生长多种作物的“五花田”。春季丢了夏季补，水田丢了旱田补，粮食丢了瓜菜补，大秋丢了“小秋收”补，这就是很多公社所坚决执行的方针。
    各地人民公社在抗灾中显示了巨大优越性，它及时动员人力物力，合理使用水源，组织工农商学兵的协作，全面安排社员生活，因而大大增强了抗灾力量。几年来由国家和人民公社兴修的大小水利工程，在抗旱抗洪斗争中，发挥了很大的作用。很多记得解放前遭灾的惨状的老年农民说，“今年这样的大灾年，要不是有人民公社，不知道要死多少人！”
    在抗灾斗争取得巨大胜利后，各地领导机关，又派出了几十万名干部，深入基层，和群众同甘共苦，同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，一手抓生产，一手抓生活，积极领导群众生产度荒，克服灾害带来的困难。现在，灾区已经完成了越冬作物的播种工作，扩种了大量早熟作物和蔬菜。各地已经播种了四千多万亩越冬蔬菜，比去年增加了一千万亩。全国不少地区小麦、大麦、元麦、油菜和绿肥等越冬作物，由于播种质量较好，小苗生长整齐、茁壮。也有一部分地区因为灾害的影响，晚茬麦和三类苗比较多，这些地区已采取了许多苗期管理方法，极力促使晚茬麦赶上早茬麦，三类苗赶上一类苗。现在各地正以冬灌、追肥为中心，加强冬季田间管理，并加紧积肥、冬耕、整修农具、维修水渠、整地等工作，因地制宜地广泛开展冬季副业生产，争取1961年有较好的收成。
    为了安排好今冬明春的社员生活，各地正在加强公共食堂的领导和管理工作，实行精打细算，对粮食不足的食堂，补充瓜菜，并对社员冬季取暖、劳动和休息，进行全面具体的安排。
    为了保护牲畜安全过冬，各地人民公社还在发动群众，采集和储备牲畜过冬需要的饲草、饲料，整修畜圈畜舍。辽宁省辽中、辽阳、新民等八个重灾县，入冬前贮藏了一千六百多万斤野生饲料，两亿六千四百多万斤饲草，修理了畜舍。
