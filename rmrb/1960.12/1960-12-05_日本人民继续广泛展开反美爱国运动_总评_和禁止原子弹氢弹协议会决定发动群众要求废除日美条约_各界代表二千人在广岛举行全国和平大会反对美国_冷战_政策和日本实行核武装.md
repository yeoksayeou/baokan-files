Xinhua News Agency, November 30th, Tokyo Dispatch: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) held an expanded meeting of its council members on November 30th and approved the struggle方針 [fāngzhēn - guidelines, policy] for the end of this year and the spring of next year.

    The struggle 方針 [fāngzhēn - guidelines, policy] for next spring stipulates that the 3.7 million workers belonging to Sohyo will cooperate closely with farmers and people from all walks of life to launch a strong struggle, jointly demanding the abolition of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, the conclusion of a peace treaty with the Soviet Union, a substantial increase in the wages of all workers, the establishment of a minimum wage system of 8,000 yen, opposition to "enterprise rationalization" that sacrifices the interests of workers, opposition to unemployment, and a demand for the restoration of the right to strike for public officials.
    The 方針 [fāngzhēn - guidelines, policy] also stipulates that Sohyo, in carrying out the struggle, will actively oppose the revival of militarist education, oppose the Ikeda government's plan to reduce the rural population by 60%, and oppose the implementation of a small constituency system that would hinder the election of progressive individuals, in order to strengthen the unity between workers and other sectors of the people.
    According to the struggle 方針 [fāngzhēn - guidelines, policy], Sohyo will launch a people's march against unemployment and poverty from mid-January to mid-March, with marching teams starting from Omuta, Sendai, and Niigata, converging on Tokyo. In addition to these main routes, large-scale petitions and prefecture-wide marches will be held in each prefectural capital. The main slogans of the march are: "Cut military spending, eliminate unemployment and poverty."
    The 方針 [fāngzhēn - guidelines, policy] stipulates that in order to realize the workers' demands, Sohyo must continuously launch mass movements before the end of February, and from mid-March to the end of March, launch long-term strikes by all trade unions in various industrial sectors.
    The year-end struggle 方針 [fāngzhēn - guidelines, policy] passed on November 30th stipulates that the year-end struggle of Sohyo workers will reach its climax on December 13th. In the year-end struggle, workers demand an average wage increase of 3,000 yen per person, the issuance of year-end allowances, and full employment for the unemployed. Workers also demand a substantial reduction in prices and oppose the government's deceptive "National Pension" system.
    On November 30th, Sohyo also studied the results of the recent general election. This powerful national trade union decided to strengthen cooperation with farmers and organize workers who have not joined trade unions. Sohyo believes that these movements should be promoted so that the strength shown by workers in the recent general election can be further developed.
    Sohyo finally passed an appeal, calling on all workers, regardless of which trade union they belong to, to strengthen unity in order to oppose the capitalists' offensive against workers in the name of "enterprise rationalization."
    The appeal stated that the Ikeda Cabinet, which pursues policies that only benefit monopoly capitalists, is attempting to pass on the adverse effects of the dollar crisis on the Japanese economy to the workers.
    The appeal emphasized that now all workers urgently need to unite in order to counterattack this reactionary offensive by monopoly capital and the Ikeda Cabinet.

Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd, Tokyo Dispatch: The Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs (Gensuikyo) held a standing board meeting in Hiroshima City on the 2nd, deciding to strengthen the struggle to crush the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and safeguard world peace.
    The meeting passed future movement 方針 [fāngzhēn - guidelines, policy]. The 方針 [fāngzhēn - guidelines, policy] stipulates that the future objectives of this national peace organization are: to launch mass movements demanding the abolition of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the Japan-U.S. military "cooperation" system; to demand that the United States remove its nuclear weapons base on Okinawa and return Okinawa to Japan, and to prevent Japan from carrying out nuclear armament.
    The movement 方針 [fāngzhēn - guidelines, policy] also stipulates that the association demands the removal of foreign military bases in all countries, the conclusion of a treaty banning nuclear weapons testing, the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones, the implementation of disarmament, and the elimination of all colonialist policies.
    According to the 方針 [fāngzhēn - guidelines, policy], the association will also launch a struggle to force the Japanese government to cut military spending, provide relief to atomic bomb victims, and prevent the government from establishing its first missile base on Niijima. To this end, the association will send a delegation to Niijima to support the local people's struggle against the establishment of a missile base.
    The association decided to hold the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs in Japan on August 8th next year.
    The association also decided to send delegations to countries around the world to call on the people of all countries to support its struggle to maintain peace.

Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd, Tokyo Dispatch: The National Peace Congress against Atomic Bombs, Hydrogen Bombs and Nuclear Armament was held in Hiroshima City, Japan, last night.
    The congress was attended by about two thousand people, including workers, women representatives, cultural figures, and representatives of many mass organizations from all over the country, including atomic bomb victims from Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
    The congress passed a resolution opposing Japan's nuclear armament and demanding the enactment of laws to provide relief to atomic bomb victims.
    The congress also passed a declaration strongly condemning the United States for pursuing a "Cold War" policy, exacerbating international tensions, and pursuing colonialist policies.
    The declaration also pointed out that, based on the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" that is hostile to China and the Soviet Union, the Ikeda Cabinet is stepping up preparations for war and carrying out nuclear armament.
    The declaration said: We firmly demand that the Ikeda government stop implementing militarist policies.
    Makoto Hori, executive director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, made a keynote speech to the congress. He emphasized that the strength of the Japanese people shown in the struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty should be further developed in the movement against nuclear weapons.
    Representatives of residents near the U.S. military bases in Niijima and Iwakuni spoke at the congress, reporting on the struggle of people in various places against military bases and demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Japan.

Xinhua News Agency, December 4th, Tokyo Dispatch: The people of Yokohama City, Japan, resolutely demand that the U.S. cruiser "Preston," carrying nuclear weapons, immediately get out of Yokohama Port.
    The "Yokohama Citizens' Conference Demanding the Abolition of the Security Treaty" decided on the 2nd to cooperate with the "Kanagawa Prefecture People's Conference for the Abolition of the Security Treaty" to launch a unified struggle demanding the immediate withdrawal of U.S. warships from Yokohama Port.
    The Yokohama Dockworkers' Union Council held a meeting on the evening of the 1st, deciding to launch a movement to resolutely oppose the docking of U.S. warships in Yokohama Port.
    The U.S. Seventh Fleet cruiser "Preston" entered Yokohama Port on the morning of the 2nd under the guise of a "friendly visit."

    日本人民继续广泛展开反美爱国运动
    “总评”和禁止原子弹氢弹协议会决定发动群众要求废除日美条约
    各界代表二千人在广岛举行全国和平大会反对美国“冷战”政策和日本实行核武装
    据新华社11月30日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会11月30日举行的评议员扩大会议通过了今年年底和明年春季的斗争方针。
    明年春季的斗争方针规定，“总评”所属的三百七十万工人将同农民和各阶层人民密切合作，展开强大的斗争，共同要求废除新日美
  “安全条约”，恢复日中邦交，同苏联缔结和约，大大提高所有工人的工资，建立最低八千日元的工资制，反对牺牲工人利益的“企业合理化”，反对失业和要求恢复公务人员的罢工权利。
    方针还规定，“总评”在展开斗争时，还将积极反对复活军国主义教育，反对池田政府实行减少60％的农村人口的计划，反对实行阻挠进步人士当选的小选举区制度，以便增强工人和其它各阶层人民之间的团结。
    根据斗争方针，“总评”将从1月中旬到3月中旬发动反对失业和贫困的人民大游行，游行队伍将分别从大牟田、仙台和新潟出发，会师东京。除了这些主要路线外，还将在各个县政府所在地举行大规模请愿和全县性游行。游行的主要口号是：“削减军事开支，消灭失业和贫困”。
    方针规定，为了实现工人的要求，“总评”在2月底以前要连续不断地展开群众运动，并且要从3月中旬到3月底发动各产业部门的全部工会举行长期罢工。
    11月30日通过的今年年底斗争方针规定，“总评”工人的年终斗争将在12月13日达到高潮。在年终斗争中，工人要求平均每人提高工资三千日元，发给年终津贴和失业者充分就业。工人们还要求大大降低物价和反对政府实行骗人的“国民养老金”制度。
    “总评”11月30日还研究了这次大选的结果。这个强大的全国性工会决定加强同农民的合作，并把没有参加工会的工人组织起来。“总评”认为，应当推进这些运动，以便工人在最近的大选中表现出来的力量得到进一步的发展。
      “总评”最后通过呼吁书，呼吁所有的工人，不论他们属于什么工会，加强团结，以便反对资本家以“企业合理化”名义对工人发动的进攻。
    呼吁书说，奉行仅仅使垄断资本家获得利益的政策的池田内阁正在企图把美元危机在日本经济中所造成的恶劣影响转嫁到工人身上。
    呼吁书强调说，现在所有工人亟需团结一致，以便还击垄断资本和池田内阁的这种反动进攻。
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会2日在广岛市举行常任理事会会议，决定为粉碎日美军事同盟条约，保卫世界和平而加强斗争。

    运动方针还规定，协会要求撤除在所有国家的外国军事基地，缔结禁止试验核武器协定，建立无核武器地区，实行裁军，消除一切殖民主义政策。
    根据方针，协会还将展开斗争，迫使日本政府削减军事开支，救济原子弹受害者，并且阻止政府在新岛建立第一个导弹基地。为此，协会将派代表团到新岛去支援当地人民反对建立导弹基地的斗争。

    大会还通过宣言，强烈谴责美国推行“冷战”政策，加剧国际紧张局势，并奉行殖民主义政策。
    宣言并且指出：根据敌视中苏的新日美“安全条约”，池田内阁正在加紧准备战争，并实行核武装。
    宣言说：我们坚决要求池田政府停止实行军国主义政策。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会常务理事堀真琴向大会作了主要发言。他强调说，在反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争中表现出的日本人民的力量，应当在反对核武器的运动中进一步发挥。
    新岛和岩国的美国军事基地附近的居民代表在大会上发言，报告了各地人民反对军事基地，要求美军撤出日本的斗争情况。
