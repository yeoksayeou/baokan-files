Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th. Suzuki Kazuo, Managing Director of the Japan-China Trade Promotion Association, published an interview in the December issue of the Japanese magazine "Chuo Koron," advocating that Japan stop pursuing its policy of dependence on the United States and restore diplomatic relations with China.

Suzuki Kazuo, who had just returned to Japan after visiting China, first discussed the situation of China's Great Leap Forward. He said that China is now holding high the clear banner of the general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and is carrying out construction towards its goals.

He said, "After visiting key factories, I feel that it can be said that China has established a comprehensive and modern industry." He emphasized, "Now, the scale of China's national economy is already very large." He said, "China has become a modern industrial country based on agriculture and with steel as the marshal, a country with a modern industrial scale."

Suzuki said that after the establishment of the People's Communes, women's labor force has been liberated, and men and women are completely equal. People's living standards are gradually improving.

When talking about the Japanese government's need to reconsider its policy of dependence on the United States, Suzuki Kazuo said, "Prime Minister Ikeda, like Prime Minister Kishi (Nobusuke), has adopted a policy of dependence on the United States in both political and economic terms, but now it has reached the stage where the policy of dependence on the United States must be reconsidered."

He said, "If we look at the content of (Japan's) trade with the United States, we can see that what is imported are our country's industrial raw materials, and what is exported are consumer goods. Therefore, once the United States experiences an economic recession, our country's exports will plummet." He believes that when the United States experiences currency devaluation, the Japanese economy will experience great chaos. Therefore, "the policy of dependence on the United States is very dangerous."

Suzuki also pointed out: The United States has been "regarded as the culprit of imperialism and colonialism," therefore, "even from a political and economic point of view, the policy of dependence on the United States must be reconsidered."

Suzuki said that Japan's "most prominent reflection of its policy of dependence on the United States is its policy towards China." The development of future Japan-China relations "has become a political issue that can no longer be delayed."

Suzuki advocated that Japan should take the initiative on the issue of relations with China.

    铃木一雄在日本“中央公论”发表谈话
    美国已成帝国主义殖民主义罪魁
    日本应该摆脱对美国的依赖同中国恢复邦交
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日中贸易促进会专务理事铃木一雄在日本《中央公论》杂志十二月号上发表谈话，主张日本停止执行依赖美国的政策，同中国恢复邦交。
    在中国访问后回国不久的铃木一雄首先谈到了中国的大跃进情况。他说，中国现在正高举社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社的鲜明旗帜，朝着目标进行着建设。
    他说：“参观了重点工厂以后，我感到可以说中国已经建立起综合的现代化工业”。他强调说：“现在，中国的国民经济的规模已经是非常巨大的了”。他说，
  “中国已经成为一个以农业为基础、以钢铁为元帅的现代工业国，一个具有现代产业规模的国家。”
    铃木说，人民公社成立以后，解放了妇女劳动力，男人和妇女地位完全平等。人民生活水平正在逐渐提高。
    铃木一雄谈到日本政府要重新考虑依赖美国的政策时说，“池田首相和岸（信介）首相一样，在政治、经济两方面都采取了依赖美国的政策，但是现在已经到了必须重新考虑依赖美国政策的阶段”。
    他说：“如果看一下（日本）同美国贸易内容，我们可以知道，进口的是我国的工业原料，而出口的是消费品。因此，一旦美国发生经济衰退，我国的出口就会遽减”。他认为，到美国发生货币贬值的时候，日本经济就会发生大混乱。因此，
  “依赖美国的政策是非常危险的”。
    铃木还指出：美国已经被人们“看成是帝国主义和殖民主义的罪魁”，因此，
  “即使从政治、经济两方面来说，对于依赖美国的政策必须重新加以考虑”。
    铃木说：日本“最突出地反映出依赖美国的政策的，就是对中国的政策”。今后日中关系的发展“已经成为不能再拖延下去的政治问题”。
    铃木主张日本在对中国关系问题上应该争取主动。
