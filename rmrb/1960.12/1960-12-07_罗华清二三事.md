Anecdotes About Luo Huaqing
Zhang Yiru, Secretary of the Huangpi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Hubei

Speaking of which, it was an evening in April. The northwest wind was blowing hard, and bean-sized raindrops and a force five gale suddenly turned a warm spring day into a frigid winter.

Luo Huaqing, barefoot and hugging his arms, stood at the entrance of the experimental station, his face full of anxiety. Suddenly, as if triggered by something, he ran into the house, glanced at the thermometer, and exclaimed, "Oh! It's minus five degrees!" If the seedlings are below minus eight degrees, they will stop growing. Now there are fifty mu of seedlings that haven't even sprouted true leaves, how can they withstand this cold wave? Thinking of this, Luo Huaqing felt like a stone was pressing on his heart. Just then, the phone rang. It was from the commune party committee:

"Resist the cold? Yes, it's very urgent... Ensure... must ensure!"

Luo Huaqing put down the phone, hurriedly rolled up his trousers, put on his raincoat and bamboo hat, grabbed a hoe, and ran into the wind and rain.

At this time, the sky was dark and heavy, and the wind and rain came in bursts. Luo Huaqing didn't care about any of this. He ran from Baishazui to the Ninth Team in one breath. As soon as he stepped into the door of Captain Yuan Xiangshan's house, he saw him discussing countermeasures for protecting the seedlings with several commune members. Seeing Huaqing arrive, Old Yuan exclaimed in surprise, "Secretary Luo, you've come at the right time. Twelve mu of seedlings in our team will be completely lost if they freeze again. What should we do!"

Before he finished speaking, a commune member nicknamed "Nothing Works" sighed, "Hey! It's not that people deceive people, it's that heaven deceives people!"

Luo Huaqing looked and saw that it was none other than wealthy middle peasant Liu Fuji. He thought: My good captain, how could you find a "Nothing Works" to discuss things with! Turning around, he noticed that seventy-two-year-old Father Li Weixiao was present, and he was overjoyed. He went closer and humbly asked, "Uncle, do you think there's a way to protect the seedlings in such cold weather? We can't let a single one of them freeze to death."

Father Li Weixiao thought for a long time and slowly said, "When I was young, I encountered several such unseasonable cold spells. At that time, I would drain the water to prevent it from rushing over the seedlings. As long as the water doesn't damage the sprouts, I think they can be saved."

Luo Huaqing was overjoyed upon hearing this, and the other five or six commune members were also delighted, saying in unison, "That's right! That makes sense." Seeing everyone's approval, Luo Huaqing said, "Let's do it then!" So the commune members immediately lit torches and rushed into the wind and rain with Luo Huaqing.

At midnight, the rain gradually subsided, but the wind was still blowing fiercely. Luo Huaqing and Wang Weimei were walking from the experimental field in Zhujia Chong to Baisha Village, where the production team office was located. At this time, there was a chorus of cock-a-doodle-doos. Old Luo couldn't care less about being hungry. He hurriedly jumped over a five-foot-wide ditch and approached Xihu Village. A strong gust of wind made him shiver twice. He stopped in his tracks, suddenly remembering something, and hurried to the village. It turned out that Xihu Village was located on the edge of Houhu Lake. All thirty-four households in the team were refugees who had come to this place to cultivate wasteland in the old society because they had no means of living. After liberation, they overthrew the lake owner, turned themselves over, and their lives greatly improved, but the thatched huts had not yet been completely converted into tile-roofed houses. Old Luo thought, "With such a strong wind and rain, shouldn't there be any problems!" When he walked to the east end of the village, he found a dark figure. It was commune member Wu Mao. His shed had been blown down by the wind, and he was shivering from the cold. Old Luo asked him, and he said his mother was still in the shed. Upon hearing this, Old Luo jumped into the collapsed shed and carried out an old woman huddled on the ground. Then he arranged for them to stay in the home of a commune member. Weimei caught up, and Old Luo hurriedly stepped forward, grabbed Weimei's hand, and said:

"Old Wang, there are more sheds in Baishazui, let's go and take a look!" Weimei didn't say a word, turned around and left with Huaqing. Regardless of their fatigue, they quickly rushed to Baishazui again, and then checked each household. When they reached the vicinity of the isolated house at the south end of the village, they faintly heard someone groaning in the wind and rain. They hurriedly felt their way to the door. Although it was dark, they could see the low shed. On the north side of the roof, the wind had blown away the grass. Weimei pushed the door open with one hand, and the old man in the house hurriedly asked, "Who is it?" Old Luo walked to the bedside and said quickly, "Uncle, are you frightened?" "Oh! Secretary Luo, why are you here before dawn?" "We didn't do our job well and made you suffer." It turned out that the old man's name was Guan Dean, and he was already sixty-five years old. He was sick, and Old Luo had personally visited him and given him medicine two days ago. So, as he walked, Old Luo remembered this old man again. Seeing that the quilt on the old man's bed was wet. Old Luo said kindly, "Uncle, come to my house! You can't stay here." "Will it be a problem?" "No way!" Just then, a group of commune members rushed over. Everyone didn't say much and helped move things away. Huaqing hurriedly helped the old man up, carried him to the house he had recently moved into, gave his own bed to the old man to sleep in, and urged his wife to cook ginger soup for the old man to drink, instructing Weimei to find a doctor to see the old man's illness at dawn. The old man stuck his head out from the warm quilt and said movedly, "Secretary Luo, you treat us too well!"

    罗华清二三事
    中共湖北黄陂县委书记处书记  张怡如
    说起来这还是4月的一个傍晚，西北风使劲地吹着，豆大的雨点，五级大风，忽地把一个风和日暖的春日，变成了严寒的冬天。
    罗华清赤着脚，抱着膀子，站在试验站门口，脸上充满了焦灼的神色。忽然，好像触发了什么事一样，跑进屋去把寒暑表一望，失声叫道：“呀！零下五度了！”秧苗要是在零下八度以下，就要停止生长。现在有五十亩秧还没出真叶，怎么经得起这个寒潮呢？想到这里，罗华清心里像压了一块石头。正在这时，一阵电话铃响，这是公社党委来的：
    “抗寒？对，是很紧急……确保……一定确保！”
    罗华清放下话筒，急急忙忙卷起裤脚，把蓑衣斗笠一披戴，摸着锄头，向着风雨中跑去了。
    这时，天，黑沉沉的，风一阵雨一阵地压来。罗华清那管得这许多，从白沙咀一口气向九小队跑去，一跨进了队长袁祥山的门，只见他正和几位社员讨论护秧对策，一看华清走来，老袁惊喜地喊道：“罗书记，你来得正好，我们队里十二亩秧，再要一冻都丢完了，怎么办啊！”
    话没落音，一个绰号“行不通”的社员叹了一口气：“咳！不怕人欺人，就怕天欺人！”
    罗华清一看，说话的不是别人，正是富裕中农刘福记。心想：我的好队长，你怎么找到一个“行不通”商量呢！转身一望，发现七十二岁的李维孝老爹在座，心里一阵高兴，凑拢身去，谦虚地问道：“大爹，你说这样冷，有办法保得住秧吗？我们一根也不能让它冻死啊。”
    李维孝老爹想了半天，慢吞吞地说：“我年轻的时候，也碰上几次这样的倒春寒，那时我是把水撇开，不让它冲秧。水只要不浪着谷芽，我看是保得住的。”
    罗华清一听，喜上心头，其余五、六个社员也像如获至宝，异口同声地说：“行呀！有道理。”罗华清一看大伙赞同，说声：“那就干吧！”于是社员们马上点起了火把，和罗华清一起向风雨中冲去。
          ×　×　×
    午夜，雨渐渐小了，可是，风仍然刮得很厉害，罗华清同王维么两人从朱家冲的试验田里，向生产队办公室的所在地白沙村走去。这时，传来一阵阵此起彼落的鸡鸣声，老罗顾不得肚子饿，急忙跃过五尺宽的一条小沟，走近西湖村，一阵大风吹得他连打两个寒颤。他立定了脚步，猛地想起了个什么问题似的，一晃就摸到村里去了。原来这个西湖村，座落在后湖水边。全队三十四户，都是旧社会生活无着逃荒来到这个地方开荒种田的。解放后斗倒了湖主、翻了身，生活大大改善，但是茅棚子还来不及全部改成瓦屋，老罗想：“像这样的大风大雨，该不会发生什么问题吧！”当他走进村东头时，发现一个黑影子。这是社员吴毛。他的草棚被风吹垮了，冻得直打哆嗦。老罗问他，他说母亲还在棚子里。老罗听罢，连忙一纵身钻进了倒塌的棚子里，把一个蜷伏在地上的老婆婆背了出来，随后把他们安置在一户社员的家里。维么赶上来了，老罗忙上前拉住维么的手说：
  “老王，白沙咀的草棚更多，一块去看看吧！”维么没吭一声，转身就同华清一起走了。他俩不顾疲劳，很快又赶到白沙咀，然后挨家挨户地检查，摸到村南头的独屋附近的时候，从风雨中隐隐听见有人的呻吟声。他俩急忙摸到门口，虽在黑夜里，倒也看得见矮小的草棚，靠北边的棚顶上，风把草顶刮走了，维么一手把门推开，屋里的老人急忙问道：“谁呀？”老罗走到床边，忙说：“大爹，受惊了。”“哟！罗书记，你怎么天不亮就来了？”“我们工作未做好，叫你老人家受了苦。”原来这老人叫管德安，今年已六十五岁，染病在身，前两天老罗亲自慰问过，送过药。所以，走着走着，老罗就又想起这个老人来。一见老人床上的被子都淋湿了。老罗亲切地说：“大爹，到我家里去！这儿不能住。”“不要紧吧！”“不行！”正在这时，一群社员赶来，大家没多说话，帮着搬走东西。华清急忙把老人扶起来，背着送到了他刚搬来不久的房子里，一边把自己的床让给老人睡，一边又催爱人煮姜水给老人喝，嘱咐维么天明一定找医生来看老人的病。老人从暖和的被子里伸出头来感动地说道：“罗书记，你待我们太好了！”
