Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch from Stanleyville: Patriotic youths and veterans in Orientale Province of Congo are responding to the call of the Congolese government, taking up arms and preparing to resist the invasion of imperialism and its agent, the Mobutu clique. To date, more than a thousand youths and veterans have joined the Congolese government forces.

It is reported that American imperialism and its running dog, the traitorous Mobutu group, after arming and kidnapping Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba and other patriots, are clamoring and planning an armed invasion of Stanleyville in Orientale Province, where the current Congolese central government is located. The Indian Press Trust said on the 15th that a reactionary armed force of Mobutu is moving from Equateur Province to Orientale Province.

Therefore, the Congolese central government, headed by Acting Prime Minister Gizenga, has issued a call to the people of Orientale Province, asking them to rise up and resolutely crush any military offensive by the Mobutu group, which is supported by imperialism, to defend the independence and unity of the motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch from Khartoum: Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba's representative, Anthony Owawi, who is visiting Sudan, told reporters in Khartoum, condemning the imperialist conspiracies in Congo and demanding the withdrawal of UN forces and Belgian colonialists.

He said that the United Nations cannot achieve the goals of Congolese nationalists. He pointed out that the Congolese people do not want UN forces to remain there.

He strongly condemned Belgian imperialism's policy aimed at strengthening the imperialists' forces in Congo, attacking nationalists, and enabling imperialist agents to rule Congo.

He exposed the disguised Belgian soldiers serving in Mobutu's troops in Leopoldville and in Tshombe's troops in Katanga and Kasai provinces; Britain smuggling weapons and equipment to Tshombe through Kenya; and weapons for Mobutu being smuggled by the French from Brazzaville. He pointed out that the U.S. dollar has played a dangerous role in being used to buy and incite conflict.

He refuted the rumors spread by imperialist news agencies that Congolese nationalists were arresting Europeans. He said that they were trying to incite international public opinion against Prime Minister Lumumba and against Congolese nationalists, but in fact, those arrested were Belgians who had bought off Congolese troops.

He said, we demand that the Belgians withdraw completely, we do not need their experts and technicians.

The Prime Minister Lumumba's representative also demanded that parliament be convened in Congo and that power be handed over to those elected by parliament. He said that Lumumba has the support of the Congolese people.

The delegation led by Anthony Owawi arrived in Khartoum on December 12 and held talks with the Sudanese Foreign Minister.

    拿起武器准备迎击帝国主义和蒙博托集团的进犯
    刚果东方省人民响应号召踊跃参军
    卢蒙巴的代表奥瓦西要求“联合国军”撤出刚果
    新华社16日讯　斯坦利维尔消息：刚果东方省爱国青年和退伍军人响应刚果政府的号召，纷纷拿起武器，准备迎击帝国主义及其代理人蒙博托集团的进犯。到目前为止，已有一千多名青年和退伍军人参加了刚果政府军。
    据报道，美国等帝国主义及其走狗蒙博托叛国集团在武装绑架刚果总理卢蒙巴等爱国者以后，又在叫嚣和策划武装进犯目前刚果中央政府所在地的东方省斯坦利维尔。印度报业托辣斯15日说，蒙博托的一支反动武装正在从赤道省开往东方省。
    因此，以代理总理基赞加为首的刚果中央政府向东方省人民发出号召，要求他们起来坚决粉碎受到帝国主义支持的蒙博托集团的任何军事进攻，以保卫祖国的独立和统一。
    新华社15日讯　喀土穆消息：正在苏丹访问的刚果总理卢蒙巴的代表安东尼·奥瓦西在喀土穆向记者发表谈话，谴责帝国主义在刚果的阴谋活动，并且要求撤走联合国军和比利时殖民者。
    他说，联合国不能实现刚果民族主义者的目的。他指出，刚果人民不希望联合国军留在那里。
    他强烈谴责比利时帝国主义旨在加强帝国主义者在刚果的势力、打击民族主义者、并使帝国主义代理人统治刚果的政策。
    他揭露伪装的比利时军人在利奥波德维尔的蒙博托部队以及加丹加和开赛省的冲伯部队中服役；英国通过怯尼亚偷运武器和装备给冲伯；给蒙博托的武器是由法国人从布拉柴维尔偷运去的。他指出，美元在用来收买和挑起冲突中起了危险的作用。
    他驳斥了帝国主义通讯社散布的谣言，它们说什么刚果的民族主义者逮捕欧洲人。他说，它们是企图煽动国际舆论来反对卢蒙巴总理，反对刚果民族主义者，其实被捕的是那些收买刚果军队的比利时人。
    他说，我们要求比利时人全部撤出，我们不需要他们的专家和技术人员。
    卢蒙巴总理的这位代表还要求在刚果召开议会，把权力交给议会选出的人。他说，卢蒙巴得到刚果人民的支持。
    由安东尼·奥瓦西所率领的代表团是在12月12日到达喀土穆的，他们曾同苏丹外交部长举行了会谈。
