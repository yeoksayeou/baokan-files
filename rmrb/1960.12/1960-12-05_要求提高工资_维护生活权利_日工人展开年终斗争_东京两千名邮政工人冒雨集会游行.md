Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 4th - Japanese workers are launching an increasingly fierce year-end struggle across the country to defend their right to live.

Two thousand postal workers in Tokyo held a year-end struggle rally in Tokyo today despite the rain.

The rally passed a declaration stating that workers would strengthen their struggle, resolutely demanding the issuance of year-end bonuses and requesting that 25,000 temporary workers be promoted to formal workers.

After the rally, all participants, holding red flags and placards, marched in demonstration on the streets.

The All-Communications Workers' Union Central Struggle Committee today instructed 140 postal and telecommunications workers' unions nationwide to hold two-hour workplace rallies on the 10th to strive for the realization of workers' demands.

The Public Servants' Joint Struggle Council, with 1.5 million members, instructed all unions on the 3rd to hold large-scale struggles on the 13th, demanding a wage increase of 3,000 yen per person and the issuance of year-end bonuses equivalent to two and a half months' salary.

The Tokyo Medical Workers' Union Federation decided on the 3rd to hold full-day and half-day strikes on the 9th, launching the seventh unified action, demanding wage increases and the implementation of a minimum wage system of 10,000 yen.

The All-Garrison Forces Union ordered its affiliated unions on the 3rd to hold a 24-hour strike on the 12th or 13th, demanding a wage increase of 3,000 yen. This is the second unified action by Japanese workers working on US military bases in their year-end struggle.
