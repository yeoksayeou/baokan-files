Xinhua News Agency, Fushun Telegram Fushun Mining Bureau's coal mines are seizing the end-of-year opportunity to organize a large number of cadres, technical personnel, and workers to comprehensively inspect the preparations for the first quarter of next year. During the inspection, the mines reviewed projects, observed progress, and plugged loopholes, ensuring that every preparation was implemented reliably, giving them the initiative to strive for continuous leaps forward in coal production in the first quarter of next year.

This year, while striving to complete the annual coal production plan ahead of schedule, Fushun's coal mines mobilized a large number of technical personnel and workers as early as June and July to strengthen the front lines of machinery repair, capital construction, and tunneling, actively carrying out production preparations. Currently, the amount of coal exposed at the West Open-pit Mine has increased by 29% compared to the same period last year; the number of coal mining faces developed by various coal mines has also increased by more than 5% compared to the same period last year. From July, the machinery repair plants launched a campaign to overhaul and manufacture spare parts, and by the end of November, the number of spare parts manufactured had increased by more than 42% compared to the same period last year. Based on the continuous increase in the supply of spare parts, the progress of machinery and equipment repair in various mines has also been greatly accelerated. By means of rotating and cross non-stop repair, the mines have repaired more than 25,000 units of various large and small equipment; the service life of some large equipment that must be shut down for repair has also been extended due to strengthened daily maintenance.

In order to further implement various preparations, the mines paid special attention to key preparations during the recent inspections, and immediately found ways to remedy any loopholes discovered. Recently, during an inspection, the Shengli Coal Mine found that the roadway installation project for the Linglu mining area, which was originally planned to be handed over to production before the New Year, was far behind the tunneling, so it promptly reallocated forces to speed up the progress of the car park installation project, enabling the new mining area to be handed over to production ahead of schedule. In order to verify the amount of coal prepared, the West Open-pit Mine also organized an on-site inspection team composed of geological, surveying, design, stripping, and mining departments to conduct inspections deep underground. The mines also sent dozens of inspection teams to conduct meticulous inspections of the repair quality of major equipment at the mine entrances.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin Telegram Kailuan Coal Mine workers are striving to better complete this year's coal mining plan while actively mobilizing the masses to carry out production preparations for next year, creating conditions for increased raw coal production next year.

Since the fourth quarter, the Mining Bureau has established a tunneling dispatch office to strengthen leadership over production preparations. The mines, headed by the secretary and mine director, formed three-way combination research groups with technical personnel and veteran workers to go deep into the underground site, help workers develop small-scale mechanization of loading and transportation according to local conditions, and promote various rapid tunneling experiences, so that tunneling efficiency is continuously improved and the amount of recoverable coal is continuously increased.

While strengthening development and tunneling, the mines also focused on the repair and manufacturing of machinery and equipment. The repair projects of large equipment such as lifting equipment, screening equipment, and substations in various mines have been arranged early, and the repair time and technical measures have been formulated. The tools and accessories required for the above repair projects have been organized with specialized forces to rush to manufacture them. The regular repair and matching of small equipment such as tunneling and transportation equipment and some damaged equipment have also been strengthened, and equipment management and maintenance systems have been established and improved. In the past month or so, more than 2,270 coal cars, electric chutes, and electric drills, and 2,372 mine lamps have been repaired in the entire mining area. They also mobilized repair personnel to self-reliantly manufacture coal mining and transportation equipment needed for production in the first quarter of next year. At present, more than 1,078 units (vehicles) of various electric locomotives, coal cars, and coal water pumps, and more than 8,000 meters of electric chute chains have been manufactured.

    抚顺煤矿检查明年生产准备
    开滦煤矿大力加强开拓掘进
    新华社抚顺电　抚顺矿务局所属各煤矿抓紧年末时机，组织大批干部、技职人员和工人，全面检查了明年第一季度的各项准备工作。各矿在检查中，通过审核项目、察看进度、堵塞漏洞等办法，使准备工作件件落实，项项可靠，为明年第一季度煤炭生产持续跃进争得了主动权。
    抚顺各煤矿今年在力争提前完成全年产煤计划的同时，早在6、7月份就调集大批技术人员和工人，充实了机械检修、基本建设和井巷掘进第一线，积极进行生产准备工作。目前，西露天矿剥离的煤炭获得量，比去年同期提高29％；各煤矿开拓的采煤工作面，也比去年同期增加了5％以上。从7月份开始，各机械修配厂开展了大修大造备品配件的运动，到11月末，制造出的各种备品配件比去年同期增加42％以上。在备品配件供应不断增加的基础上，各矿机械设备的检修进度也大大加快。各矿通过轮流交叉不停产检修等方法，已经检修了各种大小设备二万五千多台次；一部分必须停产检修的大型设备，由于加强了日常的维修和保养，使用寿命也延长了。
    为了使各项准备工作进一步落实，各矿在最近的检查中，特别注意了关键性的准备工作，发现漏洞，立刻设法弥补。胜利煤矿最近在检查中，发现原计划在年前移交生产的零路采区，巷道车场安装工程大大落后于掘进，便及时调配力量，加快车场安装工程的进度，使这个新采区提前移交生产。为了核实准备出来的煤炭获得量，西露天矿还组织了由地质、测量、设计、剥离和采煤部门参加的现场勘查小组，深入井下进行检查。各煤矿还接连派出几十个检查小组，深入井口细致地检查了重大设备的检修质量。
    据新华社天津电　开滦煤矿职工在力争更好地完成今年采煤计划的同时，正在发动群众积极进行明年的生产准备工作，为明年原煤增产创造条件。
    这个矿务局从第四季度以来就成立了掘进调度室，加强了对生产准备的领导。各矿都以书记、矿长为首吸收技术人员、老工人组成三结合研究小组，深入到井下现场，因地制宜地帮助工人大搞装车、运输的小型机械化和推广各项快速掘进经验，使掘进效率不断提高，可采煤量不断增加。
    在加强开拓和掘进的同时，各矿还狠抓机械设备的检修和制造工作。各矿的提升设备、筛选设备、变电站等大型设备的检修工程，都提早作了安排，拟定了检修时间和技术措施。上述检修项目所需要的工具和配件，已经组织了专门力量突击赶制。掘进和运输等小型设备和一部分损坏的设备，也都加强了经常性修复和配套工作，并且建立和健全了设备管理和维修制度。最近一个多月以来，全矿区修复的煤车、电溜子和电钻等已达二千二百七十多台，矿灯二千三百七十二个。他们还发动机修人员自力更生地制造明年第一季度生产需要的采煤和运输设备。目前，已制造出各种电机车、煤车、煤水泵等一千零七十八台（辆），电溜子大链八千多米。
