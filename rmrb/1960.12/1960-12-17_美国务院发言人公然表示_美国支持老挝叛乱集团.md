Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch from Washington: U.S. State Department Spokesman White, in a statement to reporters on the 15th, once again blatantly expressed that the United States fully supports the Nosavan traitorous clique in Laos in expanding their riots. White even referred to the puppet regime cobbled together by the Nosavan traitorous clique as the "Lao government." He expressed "full confidence" in the fact that this traitorous group is intensifying its armed rebellion under the direction of the United States, and emphasized that the U.S. government will provide "support" "to the best of its ability."

White indicated that the United States will continue to provide the Nosavan group with munitions and weapons. He emphasized that this is "part of the continuous support of the United States (for the Nosavan traitorous group)."

At the same time, White tried his best to deny the solemn accusations by socialist countries such as the Soviet Union, China, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam against the United States' blatant interference in the Lao situation, saying that the Soviet government's note to the United States on the Lao situation was "propaganda." White shamelessly counter-accused socialist countries of carrying out "subversive activities" in Laos.

It is reported that U.S. Secretary of State Herter, who is in Paris preparing to attend the Ministerial Council meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, held talks with British Foreign Secretary Home and French Foreign Minister Couve de Murville on the situation in Laos on the 15th. The details of the talks were not disclosed. However, U.S. news agencies have long revealed that the United States is now eager to "unite" Western countries in order to massively interfere in the Lao situation.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch from Washington: While strongly supporting the Nosavan rebel group in expanding the civil war in Laos, the U.S. government has also deployed troops in the South China Sea, plotting direct armed intervention in the Lao situation.

The U.S. Navy Department officially announced on the 15th that "several units" of the Seventh Fleet are currently deployed in the South China Sea. Two aircraft carriers, several destroyers, and an amphibious force composed of 1,400 Marines have been conducting exercises in the South China Sea in recent weeks to strengthen the "readiness" of these forces. According to the Navy Department, the two amphibious transport ships carrying the Marines are the "Paul Revere" and the "Monticello," and the two aircraft carriers are the "Bennington" and the "Lexington." The "Bennington" is equipped with helicopters that can be used to transport Marines to beachheads "for training."

    美国务院发言人公然表示
    美国支持老挝叛乱集团
    新华社16日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院发言人怀特15日对新闻记者发表谈话，再一次露骨地表示，美国充分支持老挝诺萨万叛国集团扩大暴乱。怀特居然把诺萨万叛国集团拼凑的傀儡政权称为“老挝政府”。他对这个叛国集团在美国的指使下加紧进行武装叛乱一事表示“充分信任”，并且强调说，美国政府将“尽其所能”给予“支持”。
    怀特表明，美国将继续向诺萨万集团提供军火和武器。他强调，这是“美国（对诺萨万叛国集团）源源不断的支持的一个部分”。
    怀特同时竭力抵赖苏联、中国和越南民主共和国等社会主义国家对美国粗暴干涉老挝局势的严正指责，说什么苏联政府就老挝局势向美国提出的照会是“宣传”。怀特厚颜无耻地反诬社会主义国家在老挝进行“颠复活动”。
    据报道，在巴黎准备参加北大西洋集团部长理事会会议的美国国务卿赫脱15日就老挝局势同英国外交大臣霍姆和法国外交部长德姆维尔会谈。会谈情况没有透露。但是美国通讯社早就透露，美国现在正急于使西方国家“联合起来”，以便大举干涉老挝局势。
    新华社16日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府在大力支持诺萨万叛乱集团扩大老挝内战的同时，又陈兵南中国海，阴谋对老挝局势进行直接的武装干涉。
    美国海军部15日正式宣布，第七舰队的“几支部队”目前正部署在南中国海上。两艘航空母舰、几艘驱逐舰和一支由一千四百名海军陆战队组成的两栖部队最近几星期来就一直在南中国海演习，以加强这些部队的“准备状态”。据海军部说，海军陆战队乘坐的两艘两栖运输舰是“保罗·里维尔号”和“蒙特塞罗”号，两艘航空母舰是“本宁吞号”和“列克星吞号”，“本宁吞号”上装备有直升飞机，可以用来把海军陆战队运到“进行训练”的滩头阵地上。
