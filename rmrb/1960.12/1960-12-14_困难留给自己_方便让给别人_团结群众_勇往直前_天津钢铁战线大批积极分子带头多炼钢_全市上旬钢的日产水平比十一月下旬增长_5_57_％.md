    Difficulties Left to Oneself, Convenience Given to Others, Unite the Masses, Advance Courageously
    A Large Number of Activists on the Tianjin Iron and Steel Front Take the Lead in Producing More Steel
    The City's Average Daily Steel Production in the First Ten Days of December Increased by 5.57% Compared with Late November
    (Our Newspaper Report) The broad masses of workers on Tianjin's iron and steel front are seizing every day at the end of the year, striving for a red year to the end. More than 10,000 activists emerging from the steel mills and refractory material factories on the steelmaking front are at the forefront of the battle. They seize difficulties and give way to convenience, unite the broad masses of workers, and advance courageously, powerfully promoting the rise in production. The city's average daily steel production in the first ten days of December increased by 5.57% compared with late November.
    Encouraged by the slogan of "Make persistent efforts, work hard in December, and win a red year to the end," Liu Zilong, an activist and charging team leader at the iron furnace in the Third Branch of Tianjin Steel Plant No. 2, braved the severe cold to dredge the sewers, ensuring the normal progress of production. After his heroic deeds were published in the newspaper, they immediately became a role model for the broad masses of workers on the iron and steel front. The broad masses of activists and workers expressed their determination to the Party to learn from Liu Zilong's heroic behavior and vowed to make contributions in the battle to win a red year. More than 10,000 activists from various steel mills and refractory material factories are at the forefront of the battle. They do not haggle over prices, do not consider conditions, charge into battle, and seize victory. Yu Junyou's team at No. 1 furnace of Tianjin Steel Plant No. 1, in response to the key issue of long melting times, proposed the slogan "Strive for high yield, determined to break through 7:30." All team members cooperated closely, united from top to bottom, left and right, and as a result, created a new record of tapping steel in three heats at 7:11. The activists in the cupola section of this factory proposed a guarantee to keep the open hearth furnaces well-fed. On December 8th, Zhang Jianhong's team in the first shift saw that the low melting rate of the cupola might cause Open Hearth Furnace No. 2 to be charged with some cold material, affecting the melting time. Therefore, all the workers in the team immediately gathered in front of the furnace, pooled their wisdom and efforts, and carried out a tackling performance competition, which rapidly increased the melting rate of the cupola and ensured the full hot charging of No. 2 furnace. Tianjin Steel Plant No. 2 proposed the slogan "Strive to be steel-winning warriors like Liu Zilong" at the plant-wide activists' oath-taking rally, immediately launching a vigorous tackling competition. Wang Yintai, the cupola foreman of the Second Branch, discovered one day that the material pit of Cupola No. 5 had accumulated two meters of water due to a blocked sewer. Thinking of Liu Zilong's heroic behavior, he immediately mustered his courage and jumped into the cold water to dredge the sewer, ensuring production. Because the broad masses of workers displayed such a fearless spirit, key problems were broken through one after another, and new records emerged continuously. The First, Second, and Third Steelmaking Branches of this factory saw more than 30 new records in the first ten days of the month.
    Driven by the broad masses of activists and inspired by Liu Zilong's heroic behavior, the advanced became even more advanced, and the backward worked hard to catch up with the advanced. The atmosphere of learning from, catching up with, and surpassing others surged, and people's mental outlook was completely renewed. Xiao Xianzhou, a steelmaker at Tianjin Steel Plant No. 3 who was good at starting new furnaces, actively helped others start new furnaces and spread advanced experience. After learning about Liu Zilong's deeds, a foundry worker in the Machinery Repair Department of the Third Branch of Tianjin Steel Plant No. 2 took the initiative to seize difficulties in his work. The daily output of steel ingot molds increased from the original 16 to 21.
    In the battle to win the final victory in December, the factory leaders also further studied the experience of Tianjin Steel Plant No. 3 in implementing the new type of socialist enterprise management principles and continuously improved their leadership style and leadership methods. Leaders at all levels of the factories stuck to the front line, seized key points, grasped weak links, and resolved problems decisively. Tianjin Steel Plant No. 1 established a five-person leading group to deeply grasp the production preparation work and created a new daily production record on December 6th. Tianjin Steel Plant No. 3 organized high-yield battles rhythmically, with the 3rd, 6th, and 9th of each month as high-yield steelmaking days, the 2nd, 5th, and 8th as equipment maintenance days and high-yield oil brick days, and the 1st, 4th, and 7th for summarizing and evaluating, ensuring the steady rise of steel production. This factory completed its plan two days ahead of schedule in November, and its steel output in the first ten days of December increased by 9.57% compared with late November. All steel mills adopted the working method of "three grasps per shift and nine grasps per day," grasping current production and preparing for the next step, grasping key points and general points, ensuring that each link was tightly connected and each step was linked, changing unfavorable conditions, and promoting the rise in steel production.

    困难留给自己　方便让给别人　团结群众　勇往直前
    天津钢铁战线大批积极分子带头多炼钢
    全市上旬钢的日产水平比十一月下旬增长5.57％
    本报讯　天津市钢铁战线广大职工正在抓紧岁末每一天，力争全年红到底。各炼钢厂和耐火器材厂在炼钢战线上涌现出的一万多名积极分子，走在战斗的最前列，他们抢困难、让方便，团结广大职工，勇往直前，有力地促进了生产的上升。全市钢的平均日产水平12月上旬比11月下旬提高了5.57％。
    在一鼓作气，大干12月，夺取全年红到底的口号鼓舞下，天钢二厂三分厂积极分子、化铁炉上料组长刘子龙冒严寒，疏通下水道，保证了生产正常进行。他的英雄事迹在报纸上发表以后，立即成为钢铁战线广大职工的学习榜样。广大积极分子和职工们纷纷向党表示决心，学习刘子龙的英雄行为，誓在夺取全年红的战斗中立功。各炼钢厂和耐火器材厂的一万多名积极分子，走在战斗的最前列。他们不讲价钱，不计条件，冲锋陷阵，夺取胜利。天钢一厂一号炉于俊有小组针对熔炼时间长的关键，提出了“夺高产，决心突破七点半”的口号，全组同志紧密协作，上下左右团结一致，结果创造了三槽出钢七点十一分钟的新纪录。这个厂的化铁炉工段的积极分子们，提出了让平炉吃饱吃好的保证。12月8日甲班张建洪小组看到由于化铁炉熔化率低，可能造成二号平炉装一部分冷料，影响熔炼时间。于是全小组工人立即在炉前集会，群策群力开展攻关表演赛，使化铁炉熔化率迅速提高，保证了二号炉的全热装。天钢二厂在全厂积极分子誓师大会上提出了“争做刘子龙式的夺钢战士”的口号，立即掀起了轰轰烈烈攻关赛。二分厂化铁炉炉长王荫太一天发现五号化铁炉料坑因下水道堵塞积了两米深的水，他想到刘子龙的英雄行为，立即鼓起勇气，跳入冷水中疏通了下水道，保证了生产。由于广大职工发扬了这样大无畏的精神，关键纷纷突破，新纪录不断涌现。这个厂的一、二、三炼钢分厂在上旬内出现新纪录三十多项。
    在广大积极分子的带动和刘子龙的英雄行为的鼓舞下，先进的更加先进，后进奋力赶先进，学、赶、超竞赛风起云涌，人们的精神面貌焕然一新。天钢三厂善于开新炉的炼钢员萧先洲，积极帮助别人开新炉，传播先进经验。天钢二厂三分厂机修部的一个铸造工人，学习了刘子龙的事迹以后，工作中主动抢困难，加工钢锭模由原来的日产十六个提高到二十一个。
    在夺取12月最后胜利的战斗中，各厂领导上也进一步学习天钢三厂贯彻新型社会主义企业管理原则的经验，不断改进领导作风和领导方法。各厂各级领导干部坚守第一线，抓关键，抓薄弱环节，雷厉风行解决问题。天钢一厂建立了五人领导小组，深入抓生产准备工作，12月6日又创造了日产新纪录。天钢三厂有节奏地组织高产战役，每逢3、6、9日为炼钢高产日，2、5、8日为设备检修日和油砖高产日，1、4、7日总结、评比，保证了钢产量的稳步上升。这个厂11月份提前两天完成了计划，12月上旬钢产量又比11月下旬提高了9.57％。各炼钢厂都采取了一班三抓，一天九抓的工作方法，既抓当前生产，又抓下一步准备，既抓重点，又抓一般，保证环环扣紧，步步衔接，改变不利条件，促进了钢产量的上升。（附图片）
