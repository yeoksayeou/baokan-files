News in Brief

Jilin Province Transfers Large Quantities of Materials to Rural Areas

Commercial departments in Jilin Province are successively transferring over 1,500 types of production and daily necessities, such as simple farm tools, small farm implements, and small furniture, to rural areas to meet the needs of the countryside. Jilin Province began arranging the production of these products in July. Some general products with simple manufacturing techniques and commonly needed in rural areas, such as carts, iron shovels, steel forks, hoes, and scissors, are arranged to be produced locally by county-run enterprises for local supply. More precise products are arranged to be produced by local state-owned enterprises with a stronger production base. Currently, farm tools like carts and daily necessities like flashlights and batteries produced in various locations have been successively transported to rural areas.

Daily Necessities Transported to Rural Areas

Various department store wholesale stations and daily-use industrial products purchasing and supply stations in Shanxi Province have promptly transported daily necessities, sundries, and cotton knitwear worth over 90 million yuan to rural areas to meet the needs of commune members after selling agricultural products.

Currently, the commercial system throughout the province is actively carrying out a competition to improve the supply during the peak season. The Houma City Department Store has adopted the methods of quick inventory clearance, quick transportation, quick devolution, and quick allocation. In the recent month, it supplied over 3,600 kinds of commodities suitable for rural areas, amounting to more than 2.7 million yuan, an increase of 51.2% compared to the same period last year.

Winter Crash Repair of Farm Tools

Various regions in Gansu Province are utilizing the winter to carry out a crash repair of agricultural machinery. Various locations are stepping up the manufacturing of agricultural machinery parts and conducting inspections and maintenance of existing machinery. As of now, the province has produced over 90,000 pieces of tractor and internal combustion engine parts, and 35 tons of farm tool repair parts. Each special district and county has established a winter repair leading group to uniformly arrange repair work and utilize resources in a unified manner.

Relevant provincial departments have transferred 40 technicians to various locations to assist communes in doing a good job in the maintenance and upkeep of agricultural machinery.

Division of Labor for Repair and Manufacturing, Ensuring Quality and Quantity

The CCP Puxian County Committee in Shanxi Province recently held a forum for technicians from county and commune agricultural machinery factories. The participants conducted a comprehensive and detailed study of the production technology problems of the "three major items" (plows, seeders, and harrows) and the "four minor items" (axes, adzes, sickles, and hoes) that are currently being rushed for repair and manufacture. Based on the different technical equipment and technical strength of county-run and commune-run agricultural machinery factories, appropriate divisions of labor were made for the repair and manufacture of the "three major items" and the "four minor items." Specific requirements were clarified for technical standards and quality specifications. The meeting determined that larger factories should undertake the repair and manufacturing tasks of farm tools with key technical requirements; commune farm tool factories with weaker technical strength should also actively improve their technical level to ensure that every "three major items" and "four minor items" of farm tools repaired and manufactured meet good specifications and high quality.

Quick Refurbishment of Old Parts, Quick Repair and Quick Manufacturing

Various regions in Guangdong are stepping up the repair of agricultural machinery to welcome the upcoming winter planting and prepare for spring plowing production next year. As of early November, the province had repaired 722 tractors and over 75,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage power machinery. In the southern regions where autumn harvesting is earlier, over 100,000 mu of land have been plowed for winter using tractors. In the process of repairing agricultural machinery, various localities have adopted methods such as refurbishing old parts and self-manufacturing to provide accessories. The Panyu County Tractor Repair Factory produced 164 kinds and 2,484 pieces of self-made tractor accessories during the winter repair period; 2,796 pieces were refurbished and reused from old machine parts.

Mobile Visits for Timely Repair and Manufacturing

In order to better support agriculture, the Anze County No. 1 Machinery Factory in Shanxi Province recently organized 21 workers and cadres to tour the county's seven communes, visiting, repairing, studying, and reporting, to promptly reflect the opinions and requirements of agricultural production regarding the repair and manufacture of various agricultural machinery to the factory. During the recent autumn grain purchase, the crop threshing of the Fucheng People's Commune could not keep up with the progress of drying and selling. The factory immediately sent two veteran technicians to assist in installing a corn threshing machine and help commune members master the operating technology. As a result, 45,000 jin were threshed in three days, saving more than 1,000 workdays and enabling the commune to complete the grain delivery task seven days ahead of schedule.
