Guangzhou, December 5th (From our newspaper) Guangdong Province, a major sugar production area in China, has made preparations for the upcoming pressing season after months of efforts by the sugar industry and related units, striving to produce more sugar for the whole country while saving labor. Currently, sugar factories in Zhongshan, Shunde, Zini, Shitou, Huaqiao, Longtang, and Jiangmen Sugarcane Chemical Factory have already started pressing, and other sugar factories will start pressing successively.

The CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee attaches great importance to sugar production. In order to prepare more sugar production materials, this year's sugarcane planting area has increased by more than 30% compared to last year. Through careful management, the sugarcane stalks are tall and strong. In order to produce more and better sugar during the pressing season, the Party committees at all levels have been focusing on pre-pressing preparations since July. To solve the huge transportation capacity required daily after pressing begins, the Provincial Committee, in addition to allocating a batch of timber and steel materials specifically for the sugar industry to rush-produce and repair vehicles and ships, also instructed the Foshan, Zhanjiang, and Jiangmen Special Districts to convene sugarcane transportation meetings one after another to make arrangements. In order to improve labor productivity and reduce enterprise production costs, sugar factories in Guangdong generally carried out technological innovation and technological revolution movements for the four in-factory transportation lines of sugarcane raw materials, bagasse, coal, and finished sugar products during the pressing preparation work. According to statistics, 21 automated and semi-automated transportation operation lines have been established in sugar factories across the province, and 67 single-machine automation devices such as hammering and machine lifting have been implemented, greatly improving the degree of mechanization. Significant achievements have also been made in promoting new technologies and new processes. According to incomplete statistics from the nine major sugar factories in the Pearl River Delta alone, more than 9,000 new machines have been manufactured. Among them, the Zhongshan Sugar Factory, after adopting a new process, has recently proven through experiments that it has increased the efficiency of evaporation and sugar boiling by 20% and 28% respectively compared to the past.

Making every effort to rationally utilize raw materials and vigorously promote a one-stop large-scale collaboration of cutting, transporting, and pressing to ensure that the country extracts more and better sugar from the same amount of raw sugarcane is a prominent feature of Guangdong's new sugar pressing season this year. In order to extract more sugar, on the one hand, various localities rationally arrange the pressing season to improve the sugar content of raw sugarcane and the sugar extraction rate; on the other hand, they comprehensively organize and promote the advanced pressing experience and new technologies and new processes that have been effective in various localities in the past to improve the sugar recovery rate. For example, the Zhongshan Sugar Factory, an advanced collective unit that attended the National Heroes Conference last year and recently proposed a competition to brother factories across the country to use less sugarcane raw materials and produce more sugar, appropriately adopted "uniform and slow pressing" methods after starting pressing on the 18th, and after taking various measures to pay attention to product quality, the average sugar content index for the first eight days reached 97.11%, exceeding the factory's design level and 1.28% higher than the average actual performance in the fourth quarter of last year. The quality of white granulated sugar reached 99.77% of sucrose content, exceeding the national first-class product standard. (Attached picture)

### 节约原料　增产食糖  广东各糖厂大搞技术革新提高出糖率

    节约原料　增产食糖
    广东各糖厂大搞技术革新提高出糖率
    本报广州5日电　我国食糖的主要产区广东省，经过制糖工业部门和有关单位几个月的努力，已经作好开榨前的各项准备工作，力争今年在节约劳动力的前提下，生产出更多的食糖供应全国。目前，已经开榨的有中山、顺德、紫坭、市头、华侨、龙塘和江门甘蔗化工厂等糖厂，其他各糖厂也将陆续开榨。
    中共广东省委对食糖生产非常重视。为了准备更多的制糖原料，今年的甘蔗种植面积约比去年增加了30％以上。经过精心管理，蔗茎高大粗壮。各级党委为了在榨季能够多出糖，出好糖，7月份以来就狠抓开榨前的准备工作。为了解决开榨后每天所需的巨大运输能力，省委除调拨一批木材、钢铁材料专供制糖工业部门用来赶制和修配车船外，佛山、湛江、江门等专区，都根据省委指示先后召开甘蔗运输会议进行安排。为了提高劳动生产率，降低企业生产费用，广东各地糖厂在开榨准备工作中，普遍开展甘蔗原料、蔗渣、煤和食糖成品四条厂内运输线的技术革新和技术革命运动。据统计，全省各地糖厂已建立自动化、半自动化的运输作业线二十一条，和实现锤打、机器起重等的单机自动化六十七台，大大提高了机械化程度。在推广新技术、新工艺方面，也取得很大成绩，仅据珠江三角洲的九大糖厂的不完全统计，就制成新机具九千多件。其中中山糖厂在采用新工艺后，经过最近的试验，证明仅在蒸发和煮糖效能方面就分别比过去提高20％和28％。
    千方百计合理利用原料，大搞砍、运、榨一条龙大协作，保证以同样数量的原料蔗为国家榨出更多、更好的食糖，是广东今年新的榨糖季的一个显著特点。为了多榨糖，各地一方面合理安排榨季，以提高原料蔗的食糖分，提高出糖率；另方面，全面组织推广各地过去行之有效的先进压榨经验和新技术、新工艺，以提高糖分回收率。例如，去年出席全国群英大会的先进集体单位、最近曾向全国兄弟厂倡议开展少用甘蔗原料，多增产糖的竞赛的中山糖厂，18日开榨后，适当采取“均匀和慢车压榨”办法和采取各种措施，注意抓好产品质量后，头八天的榨得糖分指标就平均达到97.11％，超过了这个厂的设计水平，比去年第四季的平均实绩提高1.28％，白砂糖产品质量达到蔗糖分的99.77％，超过国家规定的一级品标准。（附图片）
