Xinhua News Agency, London, December 24th: The Archbishop of Canterbury, Hewlett Johnson, condemned the war policies of Western countries and praised the peace policies of socialist countries in his Christmas message today.

Archbishop Johnson pointed out that Western countries are "unwilling to give up the idea of war" because vested interest groups profit greatly from war preparations and are trying to maintain the hydrogen bomb. He said that the economies of Western countries are "distorted by huge arms programs and are linked to arms production."

Archbishop Johnson emphasized: "Only communist countries dare to propose universal disarmament. Only communist countries can use all the resources now used for war for the struggle not against humanity but against the evil forces of nature. Communist countries are even now making deserts bloom and barren lands bear fruit, and they are even now diverting large rivers and digging huge canals."

In his Christmas message, Archbishop Johnson also praised the achievements of New China. He said: "Twelve years ago, if China had encountered a natural disaster like last year's, at least 20 million people would have died of starvation. But now these 20 million people are alive, and no one is starving."

Archbishop Johnson said that socialist countries are "an Eastern star beckoning to us," and "this is the great hope of the future."

    英国坎特伯雷教长致圣诞贺词
    赞扬社会主义国家爱好和平造福人类
    新华社伦敦24日电　英国坎特伯雷教长休勒特·约翰逊今天在圣诞节贺词中谴责西方国家的战争政策，赞扬社会主义国家的和平政策。
    约翰逊教长指出，西方国家“不愿意放弃战争的主张”，因为既得利益集团从备战中获得巨大利润，他们力图保持氢弹。他说，西方国家的经济“由于庞大的军备计划而畸形化了，它同军备生产联结在一起”。
    约翰逊教长强调说：“只有共产党国家敢于提出普遍裁军的建议。只有共产党国家能够把现在用于战争的一切资源用于不是反对人类而是同自然的恶势力进行的斗争。共产党国家甚至在现在也正在使沙漠开花，荒原结果，他们现在甚至在使大河改道和开凿巨大的运河。”
    约翰逊教长在圣诞贺词中还赞扬了新中国的成就。他说：“十二年以前，如果中国遇到像去年这样的天灾，至少会有二千万人死于饥荒。但是在现在这二千万人都活着，没有人挨饿。”
    约翰逊教长说，社会主义国家是“一颗向我们召唤的东方明星”，“这是未来的巨大希望”。
