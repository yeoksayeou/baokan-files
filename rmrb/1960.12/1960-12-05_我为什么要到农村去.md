    Why I Went to the Countryside
    Wang Dawan, Fitter, Yunmeng County Farm Tool Factory, Hubei Province

    Someone once asked me: Why did you leave the big city and big factory to go to the countryside?

    The Party teaches that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and grain is the foundation of the foundation. I listened to these teachings, kept them in my heart, and the more I pondered them, the more reasonable they seemed, the more I understood them, the more profound they became. As the saying goes, the soil can produce all things. Only by cultivating the land well and further developing agriculture can industry have more raw materials and meet people's needs for clothing, food, housing, and transportation.

    Who will lay this foundation? I realized that it depends on the strength of the entire Party and the entire people. It depends on the peasants, but also on the working class, and on the broad masses of working people. And we, the working class, should stand at the forefront of the struggle and play a backbone and leading role. Of course, under the current circumstances, the working conditions in the countryside are somewhat worse than in big cities and big factories, and the work is generally more tiring and harder. But compared to the countryside before liberation, whether in terms of production, life, or construction, it is like heaven and earth. Moreover, suffering a little today is precisely for the sweetness of tomorrow. We young people should strive to become stronger, and overcome the difficulties before us for the sake of tomorrow's happiness.

    When I first arrived at the Yunmeng County Farm Tool Factory, some people complained that the factory was small, the conditions were poor, and the work was hard. I had visited the Gepu Commune Farm Tool Factory in Yunmeng, and the conditions were much worse than the county farm tool factory, but this factory made great contributions to the commune's agricultural production. The workers made great innovations, and the product quality was very good. When the workers were on the night shift, several people shared an oil lamp. They worked very hard, but they were very enthusiastic. The drilled holes were neat and tidy, and the sand castings were also good. When I first entered the Wuhan Automobile Factory, the entire factory had only 300 people, and the conditions were similar to those of the current Yunmeng County Farm Tool Factory, but now the number of people has increased many times, and there are all kinds of new machines and equipment. At present, there is a big difference between the countryside and the city, but in the future, we will build it as well as the city. In the future, once the gap between urban and rural areas is basically eliminated, and the motherland becomes rich and strong, then we will feel sweet in our hearts! When I thought of this, my heart blossomed with joy, and I was full of energy.

    I grew up in the countryside. Not long after liberation, in order to quickly restore and develop the country's industrial construction, I went from the countryside to the city and entered the factory. Over the past few years, the Party has cultivated and educated me, my class brothers have helped me, and the factory has trained me, so that I have quickly grown from an ordinary peasant child into a Communist Party member and a skilled worker. When the Party called for going to the front line of agricultural production to fight, as a Communist Party member, as a member of the country's leading class, it was an obligatory and natural action to actively and proactively take some of the technology I had learned to the countryside. Therefore, as soon as the Party called, I rushed to the countryside and quickly took root.

    I have been in the countryside for eight months. My body is in the countryside, and my heart is in the countryside. I plan to do it for a lifetime and make the "foundation" of agriculture thick and solid.

### 我为什么要到农村去

    我为什么要到农村去
    湖北省云梦县农具厂钳工　王大万
    曾经有人问我：为什么要离开大城市、大工厂，到农村去？
  党教导说，农业是国民经济的基础，粮食是基础的基础。对于这些教导，我听在耳里，记在心上，越琢磨越感到有理，越体会越感到深刻。俗话说，土能生万物。只有种好土地，使农业更加发展了，工业才有更多的原料，才能满足人们的衣食住行需要。
    这基础靠谁来打呢？我认识到要依靠全党、全民的力量。靠农民，也要靠工人阶级，靠广大的劳动人民。而我们工人阶级更应该站在斗争的最前列，起骨干带头作用。当然，在目前情况下，农村比起大城市、大工厂来，工作条件是差一些，活路一般的也累一些、苦一些。但是比起解放前的农村来，无论是生产、生活和建设，真是一个天上一个地下。况且，今天吃些苦，正是为了明天的甜。我们青年人正应该发愤图强，为了明天的幸福，克服眼前的困难。
    我初到云梦县农具厂，有人嫌这厂小，条件差、干活苦。我在云梦曾经参观过隔蒲公社农具厂，条件比县农具厂差得多，可是这厂为公社农业生产作出了很大贡献。工人们大闹革新，产品质量非常好。工人在当晚班的时候，几个人点一盏油灯，他们辛苦得很，可是却干得热火朝天。钻的眼子整整齐齐，翻砂铸件也好。我刚进入武汉汽车制造厂，全厂也不过三百人，条件和现在的云梦县农具厂不相上下，而现在，人员增加了多少倍，各种新机器、新设备都有。目前农村与城市是有较大的差别，可是，在将来它在我们手里也一样会建设得和城市一样。将来，城乡差别一旦基本上被消灭，祖国国富民强了，那时我们心里才甜哩！我一想到这些，心里就乐开了花，浑身都是劲。
    我从小生长在农村。解放后不久，为了迅速恢复和发展祖国的工业建设，才从农村走向城市，进了工厂。几年来，党培养教育了我，阶级弟兄帮助了我，工厂锻炼了我，使我由一个普通的农民子弟，迅速成长为一个共产党员，一名技术工人。当党号召到农业生产第一线去战斗的时候，作为共产党员，作为国家领导阶级的一员，积极主动地带着学到的一些技术下农村，是义不容辞、理所当然的行动。所以党一号召，我就奔向农村，迅速地扎下根来。
    我来到农村八个月了，身在农村，心在农村，我打算干它一辈子，把农业这个“基础”打得厚厚敦敦的。
