Xinhua News Agency, 1st. Major Ernesto "Che" Guevara, head of the Economic Delegation of the Cuban Revolutionary Government and President of the National Bank of Cuba, at the invitation of the Central People's Broadcasting Station, delivered a broadcast speech to the Chinese people on the eve of his departure from Beijing. The full text of the speech is as follows:

When speaking to the people of this city and the vast areas of China through Beijing Radio, we must first say that during our fifteen-day stay in China, we have been warmly received by the local governments and all residents wherever we went. People have given us the greatest honor and respect. We have had the opportunity to talk with the top leaders of the Chinese government as well as Chinese workers and farmers. In Beijing and Shanghai, we spoke to the masses twice. We visited several cities in the interior and saw huge construction projects; we also saw small enterprises created by the genius of the Chinese people. We have seen the people of the whole country marching towards the future with high spirits and down-to-earth efforts, with firm ideals, full of faith in their leaders, and always following the ideological line pointed out by the party leading the Chinese working class and peasants. In addition, we held talks on trade, industry, and all other economic issues, and reached agreements that satisfied our people very much. The generosity shown by China in accepting our requests is worthy of praise and special mention. Although China is still struggling to overcome the backwardness caused by imperialism, feudalism, and colonialism, and is still fighting such severe natural disasters as those of the last two years, it still spares energy to help a small country thousands of miles away, almost on the other side of the earth. We have reached a trade agreement. According to this agreement, Cuba will sell about one million tons of sugar and other products. Our production is still limited by the evils of monoculture, because we used to be just a vassal state producing sugar for U.S. imperialism. We will purchase a wide variety of industrial and agricultural products from China to balance the total value of the goods we sell. In addition, other agreements were signed. According to these agreements, we will have two hundred young people come to China next year to study and train as technicians in various fields of industry and agriculture. We have also received an interest-free loan of 240 million rubles for use in the next five years. It will be repaid within ten years after the expiration of the usage period, which means that Cuba will repay the loan generously granted by the Chinese people within fifteen years.

We also talked freely about the international situation. We talked about the threat of our common enemy—imperialism, the threat of the most brutal and aggressive imperialism—U.S. imperialism. We all agree that U.S. imperialism is our direct enemy. It is occupying China's Taiwan, and it is sending warships to operate in the Caribbean Sea, saying it wants to defend the freedom of this region, which was unknown before the Cuban revolution. What is even more ridiculous is that the aircraft carriers that threaten the Chinese people with death and destruction every day are now heading to Cuban waters to carry out the same threat. We clearly pointed out and unanimously agreed on the following point: it is impossible to imagine that the nature of imperialism, the nature of imperialist aggression and plunder, will change in the slightest. For those of us who are fighting to consolidate the freedom we have recently won, it does not matter whether Kennedy or Nixon, or anyone else, is in power in the United States.

In general, we have no disagreements, so the entire talks went very smoothly and came to a satisfactory conclusion on the eve of our visit to Korea. This agreement just signed by Cuba and what it embodies—everything a socialist country can do for a small country struggling for independence—sets an example for many countries in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Our advantage is that we do not know what fear is, we move forward bravely, we recognize that imperialism only has relative power, but we are always ready to fight it, tit-for-tat, in any place and in any aspect, and we will never give up an inch of land without a tenacious struggle. We have not only received the great assistance, support, and sympathy of the Chinese people, but also the people of all socialist countries.

At present, in the Americas, such a vast and enslaved region, Cuba is a beloved daughter of the most beautiful and progressive countries in the world. We do not want to enjoy all this help and sympathy alone, but hope that our American brothers who speak our language, have the same customs, and share common ancestors can also receive such help and can quickly embark on the reliable road to a better future. We will tell those who want to know all the new things we have seen and felt in this country. At the same time, if you allow, we will invite all our brothers who can visit China to visit this country, to see with their own eyes what is happening in the world, to understand the great changes that are taking place in the world, despite the attempts of imperialism to hinder this understanding with the so-called Iron Curtain in Europe and the so-called Bamboo Curtain in Asia. We will make our voice stronger and more powerful than the obstacles of lies, so that our American brothers can hear it. We will also tell everyone what we have done through self-reliance and what all the socialist countries are helping us to do. In Cuba, several hundred factories will be built in the next five years, of which twenty-four will be built with the direct and almost comprehensive assistance of the People's Republic of China. The unity between the people was threatened again in the Cuban incident, but the people's response was extremely positive and caused a new failure for imperialism. Now, neither deception, threats, blockade, nor intervention can divide us anymore. Countries that openly fight for a better world are completely united and united for internal solidarity. Cuba, while receiving such generous assistance, is also fulfilling its loyal duty in the great struggle for world peace and against our common enemy—imperialism. Cuba and the People's Republic of China are also very close, because Chinese brothers came to our land very early, but not like the American and Spanish conquerors to spread death and seize the fertile land of the Indians or later the Cubans. They went to the sugarcane fields, coffee plantations, and cities to engage in semi-slave labor, replacing those black people who could no longer be transported from Africa like commodities. A large overseas Chinese community was formed there, which continued to exist long after the entry of this semi-slave population was banned. We have a plaque on a small monument that recalls a sentence from our liberation war in 1895: "There has never been a Chinese traitor." The Chinese in Cuba, although their ancestors were Chinese, have long since become Cubans. They have always been loyal to the cause of the Cuban people, and many of them fought alongside us in the new stage of the liberation war. Therefore, the sympathy and understanding between us is particularly profound. In addition, we are also an agricultural country, although a small country, but an agricultural country, and there used to be feudal relations in the countryside, and there was also a vast peasant mass struggling to obtain their own land. Moreover, through a cruel and bloody struggle, we finally entered the cities from the countryside, defeated a modern and powerful army equipped by the imperialists, and established a people's regime. In this regard, we also have similarities.

We have invited the Chinese government to send a government delegation of the level and nature it deems appropriate to Cuba to talk with our government leaders, visit our country, and see with their own eyes the reality of our small anti-American country. We are waiting for this delegation with open arms, and we believe that we will be able to repay the great hospitality we received in China for fifteen days. In any case, please believe that these two weeks have been unforgettable for us, and we hope to have the opportunity to come again and continue to learn from the valuable experience of the Chinese people's regime. Goodbye, see you again when some of you can also visit our country.

    格瓦拉少校离京前夕向我国人民发表广播讲话
    美帝国主义是我们的直接敌人  古巴人民将以牙还牙斗争到底
    新华社1日讯　古巴革命政府经济代表团团长、古巴国家银行行长埃尔内斯托·切·格瓦拉少校，在离开北京前夕，应中央人民广播电台的邀请，向中国人民作了广播讲话。讲话的全文如下：
    在通过北京电台向本市人民和广大的中国各地讲话的时候，首先我们要说的是，我们在中国逗留的十五天里，所到之处都受到了当地政府和全体居民的热情接待。人们给予我们最大的荣誉和尊敬。我们有机会和中国政府的最高领导人以及中国的工人和农民们进行交谈。在北京和上海，我们两次向人民群众讲了话。我们参观了内地的几个城市，看到了巨大的工程建筑；同时也看到了中国人民天才创造的小型企业。我们看到全国人民意气风发、脚踏实地地走向未来，有坚定的理想，对他们的领导人充满信念，并且一直遵循着领导中国工人阶级和农民的政党所指出的思想路线。另外，我们还就贸易、工业和其他一切有关经济方面的问题进行了会谈，并且达成了令我国人民十分满意的协议。中国在接受我们的要求方面所表现的慷慨是值得赞扬和特别提一下的。中国虽然还在为克服帝国主义、封建主义和殖民主义所造成的落后状态而进行斗争，虽然还和最近两年来这样十分严重的自然灾害作斗争，可是仍然分出精力来帮助远在千里之外、几乎在地球另一端的一个小国。我们达成了一个贸易协定。根据这个协定，古巴将出售一百万吨左右的糖和其它一些产品。我们的生产还受到单一耕作的恶果的限制，因为以前我们只不过是为美帝国主义生产糖的附庸。我们将要向中国购买种类繁多的工农业产品，以便和我们出售的商品总值相平衡。另外，还签订了其他协定。根据这些协定，在明年内我们将有二百名青年来中国学习，训练成为工农业各方面的技术人员。我们还得到了二亿四千万卢布的无息贷款，供今后五年内的使用。在使用期满后十年内还清，也就是说十五年之内古巴将偿还完毕中国人民慷慨给予的贷款。
    我们也畅谈了国际局势。我们谈到了共同的敌人——帝国主义的威胁，谈到了最粗暴、最富侵略性的帝国主义——美帝国主义的威胁。我们都同意美帝国主义是我们直接的敌人，正是它在强占中国的台湾，也正是它派遣军舰在加勒比海上活动，说什么要保卫这一片在古巴革命之前还是不为人知的地区的自由。更可笑的是，成天以死亡和毁灭来威胁中国人民的航空母舰现在又开往古巴领海进行同样的威胁。我们明确指出，并且一致同意下面这一点，就是：不能设想帝国主义的本性、帝国主义的侵略和掠夺的本性会有丝毫的改变。对于我们这些正在为巩固不久前取得的自由而斗争的人民来说，美国是肯尼迪还是尼克松、或者其它什么人执政都是无关紧要的。
    总的说来，我们的观点没有一点分歧，所以整个会谈进行得十分顺利，并且在我们去朝鲜访问的前夕取得了圆满的结束。古巴刚刚签订的这个协定和从中体现出来的一个社会主义国家为一个正在为独立而进行斗争的小国所能作出的一切，为美洲、非洲和亚洲的许多国家作出了榜样。我们的优点是不知道什么叫恐惧，勇往直前，认识到帝国主义只有相对的力量，但是，也时刻准备着和它进行斗争，以牙还牙，在任何地方和任何方面，不经过顽强的斗争决不放弃一寸土地。我们不仅得到了中国人民，而且也得到了社会主义阵营各国人民的巨大援助、支持和同情。
    目前，在美洲这样一个极为广大又深受奴役的地区，古巴是受到世界上最美好、最进步的国家爱护的女儿。我们不愿独享所有这些帮助和同情，而希望和我们讲一种语言、有同样习惯和共同祖先的美洲兄弟们也能得到这样帮助，并且能迅速地走上通向更美好的未来的可靠的道路。我们将把在这个国家中所看到和感受到的一切新鲜事，告诉愿意知道的人。同时，如果你们允许的话，我们将邀请所有能够访问中国的我们的兄弟们，都来访问这个国家，都来亲眼了解一下在世界上正在发生的一切，了解一下世界上正在发生的巨大的变化，尽管帝国主义企图用欧洲所谓的铁幕和亚洲地区所谓的竹幕来阻碍这种了解。我们将使我们的声音比谎言的障碍更强大有力，使我们美洲的兄弟们都听到它。我们也将把我们自力更生做出的事情和所有社会主义国家正在帮助我们所做的事情告诉给大家。在古巴最近五年内将有几百座工厂要建设起来，其中到现在为止，就有二十四个将在中华人民共和国直接的和几乎是全面帮助下建设起来的。人民之间的团结在古巴事件中再次受到威胁，但是，人民的回答是极为积极的，并且使帝国主义遭到了新的失败。现在，无论是欺骗、威胁、封锁、还是干涉，都再也不能分裂我们了。为争取更美好的世界而公开斗争的国家完全团结一致，而且为内部的团结凝结在一起。古巴，在受到这样慷慨的援助时，也在为争取世界和平和反对我们共同的敌人——帝国主义的伟大斗争中，尽她忠诚的职责。古巴和中华人民共和国也是很接近的，因为中国的兄弟们很早就有人来到我们的土地，不过，不是像美国和西班牙征服者那样去散布死亡，强占印第安人或者后来的古巴人的肥沃的土地。他们是到甘蔗园、咖啡园和城市去从事半奴隶式的劳动，以代替那些不能再像商品一样从非洲运来的黑人。那里形成了广大的华侨社会，在这种半奴隶人口的入境被禁止很久之后还是一直存在了下来。我们在一块小纪念碑上面有块牌子，它使人回忆起1895年我们解放战争时期的一句话：“从来没有一个中国人是叛徒”。在古巴的中国人，虽然祖先是中国人，但是老早就已经成为古巴人了。他们一向忠诚于古巴人民的事业，而且他们很多人在新阶段的解放战争中和我们并肩斗争过。因此，我们之间的同情和了解就显得特别深厚。此外，我们也是一个农业国，虽然是小国，但是是农业国，而且以前在农村也有封建关系，也有广大的农民群众为获得自己的土地而进行斗争。而且，我们通过残酷的流血斗争，终于从乡村进到城市，击败了一支由帝国主义者所装备起来的现代化的强大的军队，并且建立了人民的政权。在这方面，我们也有相同之处。
    我们已经邀请中国政府派出它认为合适的等级和性质的政府代表团到古巴去，以便同我们的政府领导人会谈，访问我们的国家，亲眼看一看我们这个反美的小国家的现实情况。我们张开着双手等待着这个代表团，我们相信我们一定能报答我们在中国十五天中得到的大量的款待。无论怎样，请你们相信，这半个月对我们来说是难以忘却的，而且我们希望能有机会再来看看，继续学习中国人民政权的宝贵经验。再见，等到你们中有人也能访问我国的时候再见。
