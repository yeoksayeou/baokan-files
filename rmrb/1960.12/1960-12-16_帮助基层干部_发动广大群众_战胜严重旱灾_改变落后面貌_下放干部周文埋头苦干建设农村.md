(Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang dispatch) Zhou Wen, a cadre of the CPC Jiujiang Prefectural Committee in Jiangxi Province, who was transferred downward to the Wuli Commune in Xingzi County this autumn, used his exemplary actions to motivate local cadres and commune members to overcome the severe drought. He also conscientiously implemented the Party's various policies and enthusiastically helped basic-level cadres improve their work ability. In just a few months, he helped the Meixi Brigade of this commune change its backward appearance. Recently, he was rated as a model of downward-transferred cadres by the CPC Xingzi County Committee and was commended by the county committee.

Communist Party member Zhou Wen was originally a cadre of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Jiujiang Prefectural Committee. In August of this year, he responded to the Party's call to strengthen the front line of agricultural production and was transferred downward to Xingzi County's Wuli Commune as the Party Secretary, specifically responsible for the work of the Meixi Brigade.

At that time, Wuli Commune had already suffered from three consecutive months of severe drought, and Meixi Brigade was the production team with the most severe drought in the commune. As soon as he arrived in Meixi, he and the brigade Party branch secretary, Gong Ping'an, ran all over the 42 mountain gullies and fields of the team. He saw that although the commune members had waged a tenacious struggle against the natural disaster and pumped all the water from the team's 92 ponds, the 363 mu of late rice fields in the entire brigade were still generally short of water, and some fields were already cracked and whitened. The five or six hundred mu of dry crops such as sweet potatoes also had withered branches and leaves. If the drought could not be overcome, there would be a serious reduction in production. These situations made Zhou Wen very anxious.

Meixi Brigade is close to Poyang Lake, but the water in Poyang Lake has also receded towards the center of the lake, and it is not easy to draw the lake water to the high mountain fields. After careful consideration, Zhou Wen believed that the only way was to dig a canal from the center of the lake to draw the water to the shore, and then use four or five layers of waterwheels to turn the water up the mountain fields layer by layer for irrigation. This was a very arduous task, but only in this way could the victory against drought be achieved. That night, he stayed in the fourth team, which was close to the lake, and worked with the cadres and commune members of this team to study and arrange manpower to pump Poyang Lake water to irrigate the fields. The next day, Zhou Wen led 13 commune members to the shore of Poyang Lake before dawn to open a water diversion canal and set up four layers of waterwheels, which indeed made the lake water climb up the high bank and flow into the thirsty rice fields. That day, they irrigated 3.2 mu of dry late rice fields with three or four inches of water. When he returned to the village, his back ached and he did not sleep well all night, but the next morning, he threw himself into the fight against the drought again. His spirit of selfless drought resistance greatly encouraged the commune members. Under the slogan of "Demanding water from Poyang Lake and fighting for grain against drought," they immediately acted with full confidence and connected four or five layers or seven or eight layers of waterwheels into a water-lifting dragon. In the highest terrain, as many as thirteen layers of waterwheels were connected to lift the water. In order to give greater play to the collective strength in drought resistance, Zhou Wen studied with the team cadres, and organized teams to cooperate with each other according to the benefited acreage and equivalent exchange. He himself worked wherever the drought was most severe and the waterwheel was steepest. He and the downward-transferred cadres, such as Ma Yuzhen and Deng Yunxin, were in front pumping water, and the waterwheels behind them often could not supply water in time. The entire brigade pumped water to irrigate 30 to 40 mu of land on average every day, until the late rice harvest, finally achieving a slight increase in grain production under extremely severe drought conditions.

Immediately afterwards, Zhou Wen led the commune members to expand the winter planting area. Expanding winter planting on land that had not seen rain for five months was an even more arduous struggle. They continued to draw water from Poyang Lake to moisten the fields for sowing. Some of the land was so dry that it could not be ploughed, so he and the cadres took the lead in digging with iron hoes. If the soil could not be broken up with a rake, they took the lead in hitting the clods with wooden hammers. Under his influence, all the 1,030 mu of land in the entire brigade were planted with winter crops on time.

Zhou Wen understood that the Party's guidelines and policies are the guide for all work. He collected many relevant documents and studied them carefully. He also helped the team cadres learn the guidelines and policies well. The cadres of this brigade had a relatively low level of education, so Zhou Wen organized them to study intensively for seven days at a time, often reading newspapers to them and studying policies and culture, which was very welcome by the brigade cadres. For example, this time during winter planting, the brigade cadres initially did not sufficiently recognize the importance of "three guarantees and one reward" for winter crops. After repeatedly studying the relevant editorials in the Jiangxi Daily, they immediately formulated "three guarantee" targets in line with the principles of being active, reliable, leaving room for maneuver, and having production that could be surpassed, and practically formulated "three guarantee" targets with each team. After the "three guarantees" were implemented, many teams also fully expanded the planting of winter crops in fields that were originally planned to be left fallow in winter. The teams also actively reclaimed wasteland for expanded planting. Under drought conditions, the sowing quality also reached the level of deep plowing and fine soil, with a base fertilizer of 60 piculs per mu. Once, when he was working with the masses, the masses discovered that some teams were not conscientiously implementing policies such as equal pay for men and women commune members, so they proposed that the Party branch study the matter and then convene a meeting of team leaders, work group leaders, and work point recorders to help them adhere to the policy of distribution according to work, which greatly boosted the production enthusiasm of the masses.

In his work, he also paid attention to being a good advisor to the basic-level cadres and helping them improve their leadership skills. In the fourth team, he found that the team leader, Huang Yiwen, was active and willing to work, but not good at giving play to the strength of others. He helped the team leader recognize the importance of giving play to the role of collective leadership and set an example himself in his work. Huang Yiwen later paid great attention to giving play to the role of other cadres in the team, and the work was arranged even better. Other cadres have also made progress with his help. After the cadres of the fourth team improved their work style and methods, production soon jumped to the forefront of the entire brigade. The cadres of the brigade also learned Zhou Wen's working method of going deep into the teams to be good advisors, and each took responsibility for a team, strengthening the specific leadership of the teams.

The commune members all said that Zhou Wen was their confidant, because since he was transferred downward, he has always been very concerned about the lives of the masses. In addition to paying attention to the combination of work and rest for the commune members, he also conscientiously helped the basic-level cadres grasp the mess hall and improve the lives of the commune members.

Before he went to the countryside, he also prepared medical supplies such as mercurochrome, iodine, anti-inflammatory powder, snake medicine, and eye drops to help the commune members treat some common diseases at any time, and even crossed several mountain gullies to "make house calls" for the commune members. The commune members affectionately called him "Doctor Zhou." They said, "The Party has sent such a good cadre to care for us. We can only work harder to produce and increase the production of more grain to be worthy of the Party and Chairman Mao."

Zhou Wen led the cadres and commune members of the Meixi Brigade to work together with one heart and one mind, and after three months of hard work, the Meixi Brigade quickly changed its appearance. Three months ago, in the production competition of the entire commune, the Meixi Brigade was still the "tail team" in production. Now, drought resistance, autumn harvest, and winter planting are all red flags in the whole commune. Now, the enthusiasm of the cadres and commune members for production is even higher, and they are taking advantage of the victory to do a good job in winter production and prepare to win a bumper harvest next year. Zhou Wen also expressed his intention to continue to work hard with the cadres and commune members in the countryside for a long time and contribute to building a beautiful and happy rural people's commune.

    帮助基层干部  发动广大群众  战胜严重旱灾  改变落后面貌
    下放干部周文埋头苦干建设农村
    据新华社南昌电　中共江西省九江地委今年秋季下放到星子县五里公社的干部周文，用自己的模范行动带动当地干部、社员战胜了严重旱灾，并且认真执行党的各项政策，热情帮助基层干部提高工作能力，在几个月中就帮助这个公社的梅溪大队改变了落后面貌。最近他被中共星子县委评为下放干部的标兵，受到了县委的表扬。
    共产党员周文原来是中共九江地委宣传部的干部。今年8月，他响应党的加强农业生产第一线的号召，下放到星子县五里公社任党委书记，具体负责梅溪大队的工作。
    当时，五里公社已经遭到连续三个月的大旱，梅溪大队又是这个公社旱情最严重的一个生产队。他一到梅溪，就和大队党支部书记龚平安一起，跑遍了全队四十二条山沟和田垅。他看到虽然社员们和天灾作了顽强的斗争，把全队九十二口水塘的水都车干了，但全大队的三百六十三亩晚稻田里仍是普遍缺水，一部分田已经干得开裂发白。五、六百亩红薯等旱作物，也枝叶萎缩。如果不能战胜干旱，就要严重减产。这些情况，使周文非常着急。
    梅溪大队靠近鄱阳湖，但是鄱阳湖水也已退向湖心，要把湖水引到地势高的山垅田里很不容易。周文经过认真琢磨，认为只有从湖心开沟，把水引到岸边，再用四、五层水车，把水一层层地翻上山垅来灌田。这是一件非常艰巨的工作，但是只有这样，才能取得抗旱的胜利。当天晚上，他就住到靠近湖边的第四小队，和这个小队的干部、社员一起，研究安排力量车鄱阳湖水灌田。第二天，周文不等天亮就带领十三名社员到鄱阳湖边，开引水沟，架上四层水车，果然使湖水爬上高岸，流进了干渴的稻田。这天，他们把三亩二分干白的晚稻田灌上了三、四寸深的水。回到村时，他腰酸背痛，整晚都没有睡好，但第二天一早，又投入了抗旱斗争。他这种忘我抗旱的精神，使社员们受到很大鼓舞。他们在“向鄱阳湖要水，与干旱争粮的口号下，立即信心百倍地行动起来，把四、五层车或七、八层车连成一条龙车水。地势最高的地方一直连接了十三层水车，才把水车上来。为了在抗旱中发挥更大的集体力量，周文与队干部研究，根据受益田亩，等价交换，组织小队与小队协同作战。他自己则是那里干旱最严重，那部水车最陡，就在那里劳动。他和马玉珍、邓运鑫等下放干部在前面车水，后面的车竟往往来不及供水。全大队每天平均车水灌田三、四十亩，直至晚稻收获，终于在极为严重的旱情下还使粮食产量略有增长。
    紧接着，周文又带领社员扩大冬种面积。在五个月没有下过透雨的土地上扩大冬种是一场更加艰巨的斗争。他们继续大索鄱阳湖水润田播种，有些田土干结得犁不动，他和干部就带头用铁锄挖，耙不烂，就带头用木鎯头打土块。在他的影响下，全大队一千零三十多亩田地全部按时种上了冬种作物。
    周文懂得党的方针政策是一切工作的指南，他收集了许多有关文件认真学习。他还帮助队干部学好方针政策。这个大队的干部文化水平比较低，周文就组织他们七天集中学习一次，经常给他们读报，学习政策和文化，大队干部非常欢迎。如这次冬种，开始大队的干部们对冬作物实行“三包一奖”的重要性认识不足。在反复学习了江西日报的有关社论后，马上根据积极可靠、留有余地、有产可超等原则，切实与各小队制订了“三包”指标。“三包”落实后，许多小队把原来准备冬闲的田，也全部扩种了冬季作物。各小队还积极垦荒扩种。在干旱条件下，播种质量还达到了翻深土碎，底肥每亩一般有六十担。有一次，他在和群众一起劳动时，群众发现有些小队没有认真执行男女社员同工同酬等政策，就提出来与党支部研究后，召开了小队长、作业组长及记工员会，帮助他们坚持贯彻按劳分配政策，大大鼓舞了群众的生产积极性。
    他在工作中还时刻注意当好基层干部的参谋，帮助基层干部提高领导水平。他在第四小队发现小队长黄益文积极肯干，但不善于发挥别人的力量。他就帮助小队长认识发挥集体领导作用的重要性，并且自己在工作中作出样子，黄益文后来果然很注意发挥小队其他干部的作用，工作安排得更好了。其他干部在他的帮助下也都有了进步。四小队干部改进工作作风和工作方法后，不久，生产就跃居全大队的最上游。大队的干部也都学习周文深入小队当好参谋的工作方法，各自包干了一个小队，加强了小队的具体领导。
    社员们都说周文是他们的知心人，因为他下放以后，一直非常关心群众的生活，除了随时关心社员的劳逸结合外，还认真帮助基层干部抓食堂，改善社员生活。
    他在到农村前还准备了红汞、碘酒、消炎粉、蛇药、眼药等医药用品，随时帮助社员医治一些一般疾病，甚至翻过几个山沟，为社员“出诊”，社员们都亲切地叫他“周医师”，他们说：“党派这么好的干部来关心我们，我们只有更加努力生产，增产更多的粮食，才对得起党和毛主席。”
    周文带领梅溪大队的干部与社员，同心同德，经过三个月的努力，就使梅溪大队迅速改变了面貌。三个月前，全公社生产评比，梅溪大队还是生产上的“尾巴队”，现在抗旱、秋收、冬种，都是全社红旗。现在，干部和社员们生产积极性更加高涨，正在乘胜搞好冬季生产，准备明年夺取丰收。周文也表示要继续和干部、社员们一起，在农村长期埋头苦干，为建设美好幸福的农村人民公社作出贡献。
