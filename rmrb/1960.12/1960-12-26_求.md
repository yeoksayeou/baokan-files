    Why has Xu Kaixi, from Sui County, Hubei Province, become the "most capable person" in directing agricultural production locally? The most important reason is that he can start from reality and find increased production measures suitable for local natural conditions.
    Agricultural production is a science, and science is a matter of honesty, which must be treated with a realistic attitude. What is seeking truth from facts? Comrade Mao Zedong said: "'Facts' are all things that exist objectively, 'truth' is the internal connection of objective things, that is, regularity, and 'seeking' is our research." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume 3, page 801) Of course, it is not easy to "seek" the correct "truth" from "facts". It is not something that can be achieved by arbitrary subjective thinking. Objective laws are often not visible at a glance or readily available. This requires us to step into production practice in a down-to-earth manner and repeatedly conduct systematic investigation and research work.
    To achieve this, we cannot work alone. First, we must absorb the experience of the masses, learn from the peasant masses who grow and labor in this land and have, through long-term practice, grasped a set of objective laws of agricultural production, especially from experienced old peasants. To learn, we must have a humble attitude. The production team where Xu Kaixi is located is a hilly and mountainous area, mostly "marrow bone stone" mountains, with very little arable land. How to develop production in such a place? Xu Kaixi, with the spirit of being a primary school student, went to the masses to conduct investigations and research, and consulted with confidants with full enthusiasm to understand the local soil, crops, farming systems, climate, water conservancy, and even the living habits of the people, and summarized the increased production experience of local old peasants. In this way, he "sought" the "truth" and gradually changed the poor situation in the mountainous area. Xu Kaixi's style of going deep into practice to conduct investigations and research, and consulting with the masses in case of trouble, is essential for exploring the truth and seeking objective laws. Because the natural conditions of different communes, production teams, and production groups will never be exactly the same. As the saying goes, "The difference between the sunny and shady slopes is significant" and "A foot higher in the mountain makes a big difference." The people who are most familiar with the local situation and the most experienced are none other than the peasant masses who have been engaged in production labor for a long time. We must understand the situation and absorb experience through them. At the same time, we must also absorb the experience of foreign regions and modern agricultural science and technology, which are also extremely important.
    "Seeking" cannot stop at learning, but must also go through continuous practice. Because the laws of agricultural production found by the peasant masses at a specific time, in a specific place, and under specific conditions may not be suitable for another time, another place, or another condition. Therefore, whether the experience of the peasant masses and modern agricultural science and technology are applicable at this time and place must be verified through practice in various places, that is, through experiments. Cadres go deep into practice, participate in production, and personally engage in "experimental fields" and "model fields" to test through practice whether the experience of the masses and modern agricultural science and technology are truly applicable to local natural conditions. Good experiences that have been verified through experiments will achieve our subjective wishes and achieve increased production when promoted among the masses. If we do not insist on participating in production and engaging in "experimental fields" and "model fields" to obtain direct experience, but simply copy the experience of the masses and modern agricultural science and technology, then even the best experience and science and technology will not achieve the purpose of increasing production, and may even cause reduced production. The reason why Xu Kaixi was able to turn a poor mountainous area into a rich mountainous area is precisely because he has a relatively complete realistic style and method of seeking truth from facts.

    湖北省随县的徐开西，为什么成了当地指挥农业生产的“最有办法的人”？最重要的原因是，他能从实际出发，找到适合当地自然条件的增产措施。
    农业生产是一门科学，科学是老老实实的学问，必须用实事求是的态度对待它。什么是实事求是？毛泽东同志说：“‘实事’就是客观存在着的一切事物，‘是’就是客观事物的内部联系，即规律性，‘求’就是我们去研究。”（《毛泽东选集》第三卷801页）当然从“实事”中“求”得正确的“是”，并不是一件容易的事情，不是主观上任意想一通，就能求得“是”。客观规律常常不是一眼就可以看到，伸手就可以拿来的。这需要我们踏踏实实深入生产实际，反复作系统的调查工作和研究工作。
    要做到这一点，不能单干，首先要吸取群众的经验，向生长在此地，劳动在此地，经过长期实践，已经摸到一套农业生产客观规律的农民群众学习，特别是要向老农学习。要学习，就必须有谦虚的态度。徐开西所在的生产队，是一个丘陵山区，大部分是“麻骨石”山，耕地很少，在这样的地方，怎样发展生产呢？徐开西以甘当小学生的精神，到群众中去作调查研究，满腔热情地找知心朋友商量，了解当地的土质、农作物、耕作制度、气候、水利，以至人民群众的生活习惯，总结当地老农的增产经验。这样，他就“求”到了“是”，逐渐改变了山区的穷困面貌。徐开西这种深入实际作调查研究，遇事找群众商量的作风是探求真理，找寻客观规律所必不可少的。因为不同的公社、生产队、生产小队的自然条件总不会完全一样，俗话说“阴阳坡、差得多”、“山高一丈，大不一样”。最熟悉当地情况最有经验的不是别人，正是长期从事生产劳动的农民群众。我们必须通过他们了解情况，吸取经验。同时，我们还要吸取外域的经验和现代农业科学技术，那些经验也极为重要。
    “求”不能停留在学习，还要经过不断的实践。因为农民群众在特定时间、特定地点、特定条件下找到的农业生产规律，不一定能适合另一时间、另一地点、另一条件。因此，农民群众的经验和现代农业科学技术是否适用于此时此地，还要经过各个地方的实践，亦即通过试验，得到证实。干部深入实际，参加生产，亲自搞“试验田”、“样板田”，就能通过实践检验群众的经验和现代农业科学技术，是否真正适用于当地的自然条件。经过试验证实了的好经验，推广到群众中去，才会达到我们的主观愿望，获得增产。我们如果不坚持参加生产，搞“试验田”、“样板田”，取得直接经验，只是生搬硬套地学习群众的经验和现代农业科学技术，那么，再好的经验和科学技术也不能达到增产的目的，甚至会造成减产。徐开西之所以能使穷山区变成富山区，正是由于他有比较完整的实事求是的作风和方法。
