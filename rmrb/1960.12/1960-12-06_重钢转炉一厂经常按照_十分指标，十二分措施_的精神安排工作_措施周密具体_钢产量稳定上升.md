(Our Chongqing Dispatch, December 5th) Leading cadres of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company’s Converter Plant No. 1 frequently direct production according to the spirit of "ten points of targets, twelve points of measures." Their work is solid and steady, and production is steadily rising. The plant's current daily steel production level is now more than half higher than it was two months ago.

Each time this plant mobilizes the masses to formulate measures to ensure the completion of the plan, they always fully estimate the favorable factors while sufficiently estimating the difficulties and unfavorable factors in production, thereby adding a few more points to the measures. They often formulate measures according to higher targets than the production plan. In this way, when production encounters difficulties, they can ensure the completion of the plan; when production is smooth, they can greatly exceed the target. For example, in order to ensure the normal production of cupola furnaces and converters, they actively maintain the furnaces in production and prepare a batch of furnaces. When the furnaces in production encounter special difficulties and need to be shut down, the spare furnaces are immediately connected to participate in production. On November 27th, No. 1 cupola furnace in production suddenly experienced a failure of the furnace hearth turning black and the tuyere becoming blocked, requiring shutdown for repairs, which would take several days. Because preparations had been made, when No. 1 cupola furnace was shut down, spare No. 2 furnace was started up to ensure a steady supply of iron to the converters. In order to ensure that raw materials and fuel are continuously fed into the furnace, in addition to implementing measures such as careful maintenance of cranes and strict supply management of raw materials and fuel, they also expanded the stockyard, added an above-ground transportation loop line from the stockyard to the cupola furnace, and increased the equipment for crushing large pieces of iron. In this way, sometimes when the crane malfunctions, raw materials and fuel can still be transported into the furnace via the above-ground loop transportation line; sometimes when small pieces of pig iron are not supplied in time, large pieces of steel can be crushed in time by a crusher for supply. This ensures that the cupola furnace is not starved of material and operates normally. Under the guidance of the idea of "ten points of targets, twelve points of measures," this plant not only arranged relatively sufficient measures for key production and major types of work, but also arranged relatively comprehensive and meticulous measures for various minor types of work, auxiliary departments, and small production links. This reduces the phenomenon of production losses caused by negligence in small areas, and more effectively ensures a stable rise in production.

In order to better implement various measures, this plant assigns the measures to each work team and individual when issuing production targets, and mobilizes the masses to carry out various competitions around the implementation of the measures. For example, workers operating cranes, blowers, winches, and other machines and equipment carried out a counterpart competition of safe and accident-free days around the implementation of the ten major measures for equipment maintenance; furnace lining workers and smelting workers carried out a furnace longevity red banner competition around the implementation of measures to improve furnace life.

The leading cadres of this plant have learned from production practice that although comprehensive and meticulous considerations have been made when formulating measures and twelve points of measures have been set, some unexpected difficulties and twists and turns may still be encountered in the production process. Therefore, they pay special attention to promptly supplementing new measures in response to new weak links and new difficulties that arise in production. For example, factory director Yu Zhongguo and acting shift director Liu Shengwen were on duty once in October. The production situation was very good in the first few hours, the cupola furnace supplied iron normally, the material line was full, and the converter smelting was also very smooth. At this time, while encouraging the workers, they paid attention to checking the weak links in production. They found that one converter might be wearing thin, the pouring work was relatively tight, and the mold stripping progress was not keeping up with the steel tapping progress. Therefore, they added furnace repair measures such as high-temperature furnace repair and high-temperature quick repair on the converter, insisted on repairing every furnace, and seized the time to repair the furnace as soon as the steel was tapped; at the same time, they added some steel ingot molds and organized mold stripping workers to carry out rapid mold stripping. In this way, the production situation became better and better, and the entire shift created a new production record.

    重钢转炉一厂经常按照“十分指标，十二分措施”的精神安排工作
    措施周密具体　钢产量稳定上升
    本报重庆5日电　重庆钢铁公司转炉一厂领导干部经常根据“十分指标，十二分措施”的精神指挥生产，工作稳扎稳打，生产节节上升。现在这个厂钢的日产水平，已经比两个多月以前提高一半以上。
    这个厂每次发动群众制定保证完成计划的措施，总是在充分估计有利因素的同时，足够地估计生产中的困难和不利因素，从而把措施多加几分。他们经常按照比生产计划更高的指标来制定措施。这样，在生产遇到困难时，能确保完成计划；生产顺利时，便能大大超额完成任务。例如，为了保证化铁炉和转炉正常生产，他们一方面积极维护保养正在生产的炉子，一方面预备好一批炉子，当正在生产的炉子遇到特殊的困难需要停炉时，备用的炉子就立即接上去参加生产。11月27日，正在生产的一号化铁炉忽然发生了炉缸发黑，风眼堵死的故障，停下来检修，需要好几天时间；因为早有准备，当一号化铁炉停炉时，备用的二号炉便开炉生产，保证了铁水源源供给转炉。为了保证原料、燃料源源入炉，他们除了实行精心维护行车、严格原料燃料的供应管理等措施外，还扩建了料场，增建了从料场到化铁炉的地上运输循环线，增加了破碎大块铁的设备。这样，有时行车出了故障，原料、燃料仍可经地上循环运输线运送入炉；有时小块生铁供应不上，便及时用破碎机破碎大块钢铁来供应。这便保证了化铁炉不空料线，正常生产。在“十分指标，十二分措施”的思想指导下，这个厂不但在生产关键和主要工种上安排了比较充分的措施，还对各次要工种、辅助部门以及小的生产环节，安排了比较全面周密的措施。这就减少了因小的地方疏忽而造成生产损失的现象，更有效地保证了生产稳定上升。
    为了很好地实现各项措施，这个厂在下达生产指标时，都把措施落实到每个班组和个人，并且发动群众围绕实现措施开展各种竞赛。如操作行车、鼓风机、卷扬机等机器设备的工人，围绕着实现维护设备的十大措施，开展了安全无事故日的对手赛；制炉衬工人和冶炼工人围绕着实现提高炉龄的措施，开展了炉子长寿满堂红竞赛等。
    这个厂的领导干部从生产实践中体会到：尽管在制定措施时经过全面周密的考虑，定出了十二分措施，但在生产过程中，还可能遇到一些原来没有预料到的困难和周折。因此，他们特别注意针对生产中出现的新的薄弱环节、新的困难，及时补充新的措施。例如，厂长余忠国和代理值班主任刘胜文10月份有一次值班，前几小时生产情况很好，化铁炉供应铁水正常，料线饱满，转炉冶炼也很顺利。这时候，他们一面给工人们鼓干劲，一面注意查生产薄弱环节。他们发现有一个转炉可能穿肚子，浇注工作比较紧张，脱模进度跟不上出钢的进度，便在转炉上增加了高温补炉、高温快补等补炉措施，坚持炉炉补、炉子一出钢水就抓紧补；同时，增添了一部分钢锭模，组织脱模工人进行快速脱模。这样，就使生产情况越来越好，全班创造了生产新纪录。
