Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 10th: The Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization, along with the Arab Union National League and the African Association in Cairo, jointly organized a mass rally here today for "Imperialism Out of Africa Day."

A resolution passed by the conference demanded that African people remain vigilant and struggle against the infiltration of U.S. neo-colonialism into Africa in various ways. It pointed out that the U.S. aims to further exploit the African people under new disguises.

The resolution condemned the establishment of foreign military bases in Africa and called on the people of African countries to strengthen the struggle for complete independence. The resolution also called on all newly independent African countries to continue the national liberation struggle until every part of Africa achieves freedom and independence.

The resolution strongly condemned the brutal treatment of Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba and demanded his immediate release.

The resolution condemned the imperialist countries, particularly the United States, for using the United Nations to carry out their sinister schemes in the Congo. The resolution strongly condemned the Belgian imperialist conspiracies implemented by stooges like Tshombe and Kalonji in the Congo, supported by Western imperialist countries led by the United States, and accused neo-colonialist conspiracies aimed at placing the Congo under the yoke of foreign rule.

The resolution praised the heroic Algerian people for their glorious six-year struggle and called on free and peace-loving countries to do everything possible to stop France's war against the Algerian people.

The resolution condemned the racial discrimination policies of the South African Federation authorities and fully supported the national movements of Nyasaland and Southern Rhodesia.

The mass rally was held in the auditorium of Cairo University. The venue was decorated with slogans such as "Release Lumumba Immediately," "Release Kenyatta Immediately," "Lumumba is the Only Legitimate Prime Minister of the Congo," and "Long Live Asian-African Solidarity."

Anwar Sadat, Speaker of the Arab Union National Assembly, who presided over the opening ceremony of the conference, strongly condemned the imperialist conspiracies in the Congo "planned under the banner of the United Nations and with the assistance of the United Nations Secretary-General."

Sadat said: "We strongly condemn the attitude taken by the United Nations in the Congo." He stated: "We in Africa will never succumb to the plots and tricks of the imperialists, and we will never give up our struggle. We will resist all the tricks of the Western imperialists. We will never be willing to become victims of the 'so-called free world' that does not know what freedom is."

Sadat said: "We want to tell the Western imperialists, especially the U.S. imperialists, that we will never bargain, we will never agree to incomplete solutions, and we will never compromise on the issue of our freedom and national independence."

Sadat finally expressed the hope that in the near future, a mass rally will be held to "celebrate the death of imperialism in Africa."

Youssef el-Sebai, Secretary-General of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization, warned the imperialists at the conference: "Get out of Africa before this continent becomes your grave!" In his speech, he praised the heroic fighters of Algeria, the Congo, and other African countries.

The Algerian representative pointed out in his speech that the Algerian people, who have already made enormous sacrifices, will continue their struggle until they achieve final victory and complete freedom and independence. He called on African countries to support the Algerian people's anti-imperialist struggle.

The Zanzibar representative pointed out that the strange interest recently shown by the United States in Africa is nothing more than an action by the new imperialism to conceal its rule. He said, "We are convinced that we will drive out the imperialists and their lackeys and prevent any infiltration into our continent." He said, "We are willing to warn the United States and other imperialists that the African people will always remain vigilant. Our people have gained very painful experience and will never surrender our freedom." He finally said that the imperialists have no right to stay in Africa at all, they must all leave now and leave Africa quickly.

The Southern Rhodesia representative pointed out that the lifespan of imperialists and colonialists in Africa is numbered. Referring to the situation in the Congo, he accused the Mobutu group of serving Belgian and American capitalists.

The resolution adopted by the mass rally held in Beijing on November 28 in support of the just struggle of the Congolese people and the African people was read out at the meeting.

Representatives from various African offices in Cairo and representatives from the Soviet Union, Japan, and Indonesia of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization also spoke at the conference. They unanimously condemned the imperialist conspiracies in the Congo and demanded the release of Prime Minister Lumumba. They also expressed their support for the struggle for freedom and independence in the Congo, Algeria, and all Asian and African countries.
