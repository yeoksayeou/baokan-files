    Weather Sentinels
    Gansu Province has established over 1,000 weather stations (groups, outposts) in rural areas, with approximately 20,000 people holding the glorious position of weather sentinels. They have mastered a large number of weather proverbs and local methods for predicting the weather, forming supplementary forecasting networks in various regions. Combining modern meteorological science with mass experience, they have improved the quality of meteorological services for agricultural production, greatly reducing the damage to crops from frost, strong winds, cold waves, hail, and rain and snow. The following are some short stories about this:
    Safe and Sound
    In the evening, a strong wind suddenly rose, and dust filled the sky, making it impossible to see people's faces across from you. However, the wheat straw stacks of the Dajialiang Brigade in the Qinchuan Commune of Lanzhou City were securely weighed down, and the sheep safely returned to their pens before the strong wind arrived. Everything was safe and sound. The commune members' faces showed satisfied smiles.
    On the afternoon of the day the strong wind blew, Yang Qingying, the leader of the Mu Guiying Weather Group of the Dajialiang Brigade, heard a strong wind forecast on the radio. To make the forecast more accurate, she immediately checked her physical observation room, reviewed the collected weather proverbs, carefully observed the changes in the sky, and visited experienced old farmers for their "sky-watching" expertise. Based on the information gathered, she skillfully analyzed and researched, finally confirming the conclusion that a strong wind was coming, and reported it to the brigade's Party General Branch.
    The Party General Branch immediately formed two task forces. One group rode bicycles to find the grazing sheep, while the other group inspected houses, pens, and other structures. They quickly reinforced what needed reinforcement and weighed down all the straw stacks with stones, door panels, and wet mud to prevent the wind from blowing them away.
    Clear Skies for Rushing the Harvest
    The famous Gannan Grassland has always had unpredictable weather. This autumn harvest season, it rained continuously. Watching the grain in the fields ripen day by day, the people's hearts were as if being burned in oil.
    The meteorological staff of the Tao'yin Commune Climate Service Station in Lintan County felt the same way as the commune members, eagerly hoping for clear weather. In order not to miss any sunny opportunity, they constantly monitored the changes in the sky, carefully observed various objects predicting the weather, and analyzed the obtained data under the lamp in a meticulous manner. They also braved the wind and rain to visit old farmers from house to house to discuss the results of their research. Thanks to their active efforts, they finally determined that the 25th and 26th would be sunny days, and they immediately issued a forecast with joy.
    Based on the forecast, the Tao'yin Commune Party Committee immediately mobilized all personnel and prepared for the rush harvest. The predicted days arrived, and indeed, the sky was clear. All the commune members happily threw themselves into a tense harvest battle. Thanks to thorough preparation, they completed the harvesting of all ripe crops after two days of hard work, avoiding losses.
    Changing the Farmland Climate
    On the Dongzhiyuan, known as the "granary" of eastern Gansu, wheat seedlings often appeared to be frozen to death in patches in the wheat fields every year after the harsh winter when the wheat seedlings turned green. In summer, when the wind blew and it rained, the crops often fell over. Therefore, how to ensure that the wheat could safely survive the winter, withstand the wind and rain, and not fall over became a concern for every meteorological worker.
    Wu Xiuzhen, a young female meteorologist from the Xifeng Commune Meteorological Station in Qingyang County, learned from the meteorological data of the commune's weather station that northerly and northwesterly winds were prevalent in winter and spring on the Dongzhiyuan, while southeasterly winds were more common in summer and autumn. Based on this characteristic, and considering the need for good light and ventilation during plant growth, she boldly put forward a brand-new suggestion: change the original east-west sowing rows of winter wheat to north-south sowing rows to create favorable farmland climate conditions for crops.
    The Party Committee studied Wu Xiuzhen's initiative and believed that this approach had many advantages: aligning the wheat sowing rows with the wind direction would allow the wind to flow easily, the wheat stalks would not be easily blown down, and the crop's light-receiving surface would be enlarged, increasing the amount of time of exposure to sunlight, allowing the plants to receive uniform light, enhancing photosynthesis, making the crops mature uniformly, and reducing winter mortality.
    The Xifeng Commune changed the sowing rows in some wheat fields last winter, and the experimental results were very good, effectively reducing the mortality rate of winter wheat. This year, more production teams promoted this advanced measure during the winter wheat sowing.

### 气象哨兵

    气象哨兵
    甘肃省已在农村建立气象站（组、哨）一千多个，约有两万名群众担任了气象哨兵的光荣职务。他们掌握了大量的气象谚语和土法预测天气的经验，组成各个不同地区的补充预报网，既有近代气象科学，又有群众经验，从而提高了气象为农业生产服务的质量，使霜冻、大风、寒潮、冰雹、雨雪大大地降低了危害庄稼的程度。以下就是关于这方面的几个小故事：
    平安无事
    傍晚，大风骤起，尘土漫天，对面看不见人脸。可是，兰州市秦川公社达家梁大队的麦草堆，却压得严严实实，羊群也在大风到来之前安全地回到了圈里。一切都是平安无事。社员们的脸上都显出了满意的笑容。
    就在刮大风的那天下午，达家梁大队穆桂英气象组组长杨清英，从广播里听到大风预报，为了使预报更加准确，立即检查了自己的物验室，并翻阅收集到的有关气象谚语，细心观察天空的变化，还访问对“看天”有经验的老农。根据了解到的情况，她熟练地进行了分析研究，最后确定大风将要来临的结论，并向大队党总支汇报。
    党总支立即组成两路大军，一路骑上自行车分头寻找正在放牧的羊群，一路检查房屋、圈棚等，该加固的很快加固，并给所有草垛压上石块、门板和湿泥等，防止大风把草堆刮跑。
    晴空万里抢收忙
    著名的甘南草原，天气一向变幻莫测。今年秋收时节，阴雨连绵，看着地里一天比一天黄熟的粮食，人们的心就像火烧油煎一样。
    临潭县洮阴公社气候服务站气象员和社员的心情一样，眼巴巴地盼望有个晴朗的天气。为了不错过任何一个晴天的时机，他们不断地监视着天空的变化，细心地观察各种预测天气的实物，伏在灯下周密地分析所得到的资料，又把研究出来的结果，冒着风雨挨家挨户地找老农座谈……，由于他们的积极努力，终于测定二十五、二十六日两天是晴天，他们怀着喜悦心情，立即发出预报。
    洮阴公社党委根据预报，马上动员所有的人马，做好抢收准备工作。预测的日子到来了，果然晴空万里，全体社员喜气洋洋地投入了一场紧张的抢收战斗，由于事先准备充分，经过两天苦战，就把全部成熟的庄稼收割完毕，避免了损失。改变农田气候
    号称陇东“粮仓”的董志塬上，每当严冬过去麦苗返青的时候，麦田里常常出现片片被冻死的麦苗；夏天刮风下雨，作物又常常倒伏。因此，怎样保证小麦安全过冬，经受风吹雨打，不致倒伏，就成为每个气象工作人员关注的问题。
    庆阳县西峰公社年轻的女气象员武秀珍从公社气象站的气象资料里，知道董志塬上冬春季多北风和西北风，夏秋间多东南风的气象规律。根据这个特点，她又考虑到植物生长期间需要良好的光照和通风条件，便勇敢地提出一个崭新的建议：把冬小麦由原来的东西播行改为南北播行，给农作物创造有利的农田气候条件。
    党委研究了武秀珍的创议，认为这种作法有很多好处，即：把小麦播行与风向平行，风容易流通，麦秆也不容易被风吹倒，同时作物受光面加大，照射的时间也长，植株能均匀地受到光照，增强光合作用，使作物成熟整齐，减少越冬死亡。
    西峰公社在去年冬天改变了部分麦田的播行，试验效果很好，有效地降低了越冬小麦的死亡率。今年冬麦播种，就有更多的生产队推广了这项先进措施。
