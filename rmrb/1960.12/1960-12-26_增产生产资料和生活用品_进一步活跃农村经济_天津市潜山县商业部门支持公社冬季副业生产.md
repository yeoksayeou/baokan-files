Increase Production of Production Materials and Daily Necessities, Further Revitalize the Rural Economy
Tianjin Municipality and Qianshan County Commercial Departments Support Commune Winter Sideline Production

    (Our Dispatch) Tianjin Municipality’s commercial departments, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, are actively supporting the development of diversified operations in rural areas during the winter.

    The city’s commercial departments have dispatched more than 4,000 cadres to go deep into communes and production teams to help them rationally arrange labor, formulate plans for developing diversified operations, and launch a variety of operations. As of the end of November, people's communes in the city's rural areas had already launched more than 150 types of diversified production. In terms of the production of agricultural production materials, more than 1.5 million pieces of medium-sized and small farm tools, reed mats, soil baskets, carrying baskets, and the like have already been produced. Some commune members are also braiding straw hat braids, making shoe soles, producing soy sauce, and making cooking utensils. Commercial departments at all levels have helped production teams formulate production quotas and reward systems, greatly stimulating the production enthusiasm of commune members. Based on the principle of using local materials and producing locally, commercial departments are doing everything possible to help communes and production teams collect sideline raw materials. The commercial departments have also conducted surveys, adhering to the principles of voluntary mutual benefit and equivalent exchange, adopting methods of pricing according to quality and paying in cash, and have helped some production teams mutually adjust a batch of raw materials. Wuqiao County's commercial department organized twenty-one production teams to coordinate, mutually adjusting more than 120,000 catties of raw materials such as Jing willow branches and reeds. For raw materials needed for production that cannot be solved locally, the Municipal Native Produce and Sundries Company has planned to purchase them from other places, transporting, allocating, and supplying them as they are purchased. By the end of November, more than 2,500 tons of raw materials for sideline production had been supplied to various places.

    Commercial departments in various places have also strengthened their purchasing forces, added purchasing outlets, and vigorously carried out the purchasing of rural sideline products in the spirit of giving consideration to both primary and secondary aspects, and grasping both large and small aspects. The total value of the city's purchase of native and sideline products in October increased by 18% compared with the same period last year. Commercial departments at all levels have also organized a large number of technicians to go deep into communes and production teams, adopting a variety of simple and easy methods such as holding technical observation meetings, symposiums, and master-apprentice pairings to introduce production experience to the masses, help improve technology, and ensure product quality.

    (Our Hefei Dispatch, 25th) The commercial departments of Qianshan County, Anhui Province, actively support the people's communes and production brigades in developing winter sideline production. For only a few major sideline products, the total output value from October to November reached 730,000 yuan, an increase of 11% over the same period last year.

    In late September, the county's commercial department organized more than 100 people to go deep into the people's communes and production brigades to help arrange and develop sideline production. They followed the principle of three-level ownership with the production team as the foundation, and implemented the operating policy with the production brigade as the main body. In addition to linking up with the communes and helping with the few perennial fixed large-scale sideline industries that the management brigades could not handle, the commercial departments mainly helped the production brigades formulate winter sideline production plans based on local conditions according to market needs, and generally signed production and sales contracts. For some sideline industries that were not suitable for brigade management or that the brigades could not fully manage directly, the production brigades adopted methods of fixing work, fixing output, fixing quality, fixing time, fixing work points, and fixing rewards and punishments to organize production teams to manage them. In addition, under the principle of not affecting collective production, they also organized commune members to engage in small-scale household sideline production such as raising chickens and making straw sandals. In this way, the enthusiasm of commune members to engage in sideline production was mobilized from all aspects.

    The county's commercial department vigorously carried out the supply of sideline raw materials. In order to support bamboo mat production, the commercial department investigated the county's Mao bamboo resources, sent cadres to go deep into the communes and teams to strengthen technical guidance, and signed raw material purchase and sales contracts with Ningguo and Jiangxi, purchasing 2.5 million catties of Mao bamboo. Compiling raincoat needs silk wool grass, the commercial department in late autumn to help the production areas of the commune, the team, collected more than 120,000 pounds, an increase of ten times over last year. At present, the county's commercial departments prepared raw materials for winter sideline production, the value of up to more than 3.2 million yuan.

    According to the instructions of the county party committee, Qianshan County's commercial department concentrated more manpower and material resources to focus on helping production brigades with weak production foundations. Kangbu Brigade of Meicheng Commune originally planned to weave 1,500 bamboo mats this year due to insufficient funds and raw materials. With the active help of the commercial department, the brigade expanded its winter bamboo mat weaving plan to 20,000 mats, and its daily output soared from 30 mats to 300 mats. (Xinhua News Agency Nanchang Electric) The state-owned store of Danan People's Commune in Guangfeng County, Jiangxi Province, actively helps the commune to develop collective and commune members' personal pig raising production. By the end of November this year, the number of pigs in the entire commune has increased by about 70% compared with last year, and the number of pigs now in pens has increased by 30% compared with the end of last year, with an average of two and a half pigs per household. The entire commune completed the plan to sell live pigs to the state by the end of October. The income from the sale of live pigs by small teams and canteens has accounted for about one-third of the sideline income.

    The state-owned store of Danan Commune constantly helps the commune collective and commune members solve various problems in pig raising production through its own purchasing and sales activities. For example, with more pigs being raised, the pig source felt insufficient. The store sent a special person to Yushan County to purchase more than 200 piglets, and also organized rural market transactions, allocating more than 1,600 piglets, which effectively promoted pig raising production. In order to prevent the spread of pig diseases, the store took the initiative to purchase more than 1,000 yuan worth of veterinary drugs and supplied them to veterinary stations, epidemic prevention teams, and pig raising units in a timely manner.

    Yaoshan Production Team of Chengjiang People's Commune in Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, actively develops winter sideline production. The ramie hat production teams of various small teams carried out high-yield and high-quality labor competitions, so that the output and quality continued to improve. This is the first production team's "Ten Clever Girls" ramie hat group members are weaving ramie hats.

    增产生产资料和生活用品   进一步活跃农村经济
    天津市潜山县商业部门支持公社冬季副业生产
    本报讯　天津市商业部门在各级党委领导下，积极支持农村开展冬季多种经营。
    全市商业部门抽调了四千多名干部深入公社和生产队，帮助公社、生产队合理安排劳动力，制订发展多种经营的规划，开展多种经营。截至11月底，全市农村各人民公社已开展多种经营生产一百五十多种。在农业生产资料的生产方面，现在已经生产出中小型农具和苇席、土篮、抬筐等一百五十多万件。还有一些社员编草帽辫，纳鞋底，制酱油和炊事用具等。各级商业部门帮助生产队制定了生产定额和奖励制度，大大激发了社员的生产积极性。商业部门根据就地取材、就地生产的原则，千方百计帮助公社、生产队采打副业原料。商业部门还通过摸底排队，本着自愿两利、等价交换的原则，采取按质论价，现款收购的办法，帮助一些生产队相互调剂了一批原料。吴桥县商业部门组织二十一个生产队挂钩，相互调剂了荆柳条、苇子等原料十二万多斤。对生产需要而当地又不能解决的原料，市土产杂品公司就有计划地去外地采购，随采购，随调运，随下放，随供应。到11月末，已供应各地副业生产原料两千五百多吨。
    各地商业部门还加强收购力量，增设收购网点，本着主次兼顾、大小齐抓的精神，大力开展农村副业产品收购工作。全市10月份收购土、副产品的总值，比去年同期增加了18％。各级商业部门还组织了大批技术人员，深入公社、生产队，采取开技术观摩会、座谈会，师傅带徒弟等多种简便易行的方法，向群众介绍生产经验，帮助提高技术，保证产品质量。
    本报合肥25日电　安徽省潜山县商业部门积极支持各人民公社、生产大队开展冬季副业生产。仅几项大宗副业产品，10至11月总产值就达七十三万元，比去年同期增加11％。
    9月下旬，这个县的商业部门便组织一百多人深入各人民公社和生产大队，帮助安排和开展副业生产。他们按照三级所有、队为基础的原则，贯彻了以生产大队为主的经营方针。商业部门除了同公社挂钩，帮助经营大队搞不了的少数常年固定性的大型副业以外，主要是帮助生产大队根据市场需要因地制宜地制定冬季副业生产规划，并且普遍订立了产销合同；一部分不适宜于大队经营或者大队不能全部直接经营的副业，由生产大队采取定工、定产、定质量、定时间、定工分、定奖惩的办法，组织生产小队经营；此外，在不影响集体生产的原则下，也组织社员群众从事养鸡、打草鞋等小规模的家庭副业生产。这样就从各方面调动了公社社员从事副业生产的积极性。
    这个县的商业部门大力开展了副业原料的供应工作。为了支持竹席生产，商业部门一面调查全县毛竹资源，派干部深入社队加强技术指导，一面同宁国、江西订立原料购销合同，购买毛竹二百五十万斤。编蓑衣需要丝毛草，商业部门在秋末就帮助产区的社、队，采集了十二万多斤，比去年增加十倍。目前，全县商业部门为冬季副业生产准备的原料，价值达三百二十多万元。
    潜山县商业部门根据县委指示，集中了较多的人力、物力重点帮助生产基础薄弱的生产大队。梅城公社康埠大队由于资金、原料不太充裕，原订今年编竹席一千五百条。经过商业部门积极帮助，这个大队把冬季编竹席计划扩大到两万条，日产量由三十条猛增到三百条。据新华社南昌电　江西省广丰县大南人民公社国营商店积极帮助公社发展集体和社员个人养猪生产，今年到11月底为止，全公社的猪比去年增加70％左右，现在圈存数比去年年底增加30％，平均每户圈存猪达二头半。全社在10月底就完成了向国家出售生猪的计划。小队和食堂出售生猪的收入已占副业收入的三分之一左右。
    大南公社国营商店不断通过自己的购销业务活动，帮助公社集体和社员个人解决养猪生产中的各种问题。例如，养猪的多了，猪源感到不足。商店便派专人去邻县玉山购来二百多头仔猪，还组织农村集市交易，调剂出仔猪一千六百多头，有力地推动了养猪生产。为防止猪病疫流行，商店主动购来一千多元的兽医药品，及时供应给兽医站、防疫组和养猪单位。（附图片）
