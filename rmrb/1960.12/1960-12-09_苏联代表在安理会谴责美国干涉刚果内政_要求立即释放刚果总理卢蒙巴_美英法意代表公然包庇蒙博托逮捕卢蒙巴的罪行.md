Xinhua News Agency, December 8th, New York: At the request of the Soviet representative, the United Nations Security Council held meetings on the morning and evening of December 7th to discuss relevant emergency measures to be taken regarding the recent developments in the Republic of the Congo.

The Soviet government's statement on the Congo situation has been distributed to delegations as a document of the United Nations General Assembly. The Soviet Union submitted a proposal to the Security Council condemning Belgium and other colonial countries, including the United States, for continuing to interfere in the internal affairs of the Congo. It also demanded that United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld guarantee the immediate release of Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba and take all steps to guarantee the activities of the Congo's legitimate government and parliament.

The Soviet Union also demanded that the "United Nations Force" in the Congo disarm Mobutu's troops and demanded the immediate withdrawal of Belgian military and government personnel from the Congo.

After the Security Council's president for this month, Soviet delegation head Zorin, announced the opening of the meeting, the United States and representatives of U.S. allies participating in the U.S.-controlled military bloc arrogantly attempted to obstruct the urgent and effective discussion of the dangerous situation in the Republic of the Congo, which had been formed by the actions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization colonialist countries and their servants. The representatives of the United States, Britain, France, and Italy unreasonably demanded that the Soviet government's statement not be included on the agenda, because the statement clearly pointed out that the United States and its military allies were the main culprits for the great deterioration of the Congo situation. After the attempt to obstruct the discussion of the Soviet proposal failed, the United States, Britain, Italy, and Argentina put forward a proposal entitled "The Congo Question," which essentially supported the Mobutu rebel group's crime of subverting the legitimate government of the Congo and arresting Prime Minister Lumumba.

The meeting finally adopted a proposal put forward by Ceylon, which included both the four-nation "Congo Question" and the Soviet Union's proposal on taking emergency measures regarding the Congo situation on the agenda.

U.S. Representative Wadsworth again tried to create new obstacles, attempting to deprive the Soviet representative of the right to chair the Security Council meeting under the pretext that the Soviet Union was "related to the Congo incident."

The U.S. representative's fallacy was refuted by Soviet Representative Zorin.

At the evening meeting, the Security Council invited representatives from Mali, Guinea, Indonesia, Cameroon, Yugoslavia, and the Congo (capital in Léopoldville) to participate in the council's discussions. Polish and Soviet representatives stated that their governments did not consider the Congolese who were invited to be the true representatives of the Congolese people.

United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld was the first to speak at the evening meeting.

In his speech, Hammarskjöld did not say a word to condemn the Mobutu bandit gang's crime of arresting Prime Minister Lumumba.

He expressed opposition to withdrawing the "United Nations Force" from the Congo before the position of the Congolese army, that is, Mobutu's armed bandits, was consolidated.

In order to cover up the United Nations' interference in the Congo's internal affairs and its support for activities to subvert the Lumumba government, Hammarskjöld greatly slandered the Congolese people. He even said that the current situation in the Congo was the result of "the failure of the Congo's political leaders and the Congolese people."

Ignoring the insistence of the Soviet and Polish representatives to continue the debate, the meeting adopted Argentina's proposal and adjourned until the 8th.

    苏联代表在安理会谴责美国干涉刚果内政
    要求立即释放刚果总理卢蒙巴
    美英法意代表公然包庇蒙博托逮捕卢蒙巴的罪行
    新华社8日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会在苏联代表要求下7日上午和晚上举行会议，讨论就刚果共和国最近的事态发展采取有关的紧急措施的问题。
    苏联政府关于刚果局势的声明已经作为联合国大会的文件分发给各代表团。苏联向安理会提出了一个提案，这个提案谴责比利时和美国等其他殖民国家继续干涉刚果内政，并且要联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德保证立即释放刚果总理卢蒙巴和采取一切步骤保证刚果合法政府和议会的活动。
    苏联还要求在刚果的“联合国军”解除蒙博托军队的武装，和要求比利时军事和政府人员立即撤出刚果。
    在安理会本月份执行主席、苏联代表团团长佐林宣布开会后，美国和参加美国控制下的军事集团的美国盟国的代表，狂妄地企图阻挠刻不容缓地和有效地讨论由于北大西洋公约组织殖民主义国家及其仆从的行动而形成的刚果共和国的危险局势。美国、英国、法国和意大利代表无理地要求在议程上不提苏联政府的声明，因为这个声明中明确指出美国和它的军事盟国是使刚果局势大大恶化的主要祸首。在阻挠讨论苏联提案的企图失败后，美国、英国、意大利和阿根廷便提出一个名为“刚果问题”的提案，这个提案实质上支持蒙博托叛乱集团颠复刚果合法政府和逮捕卢蒙巴总理的罪行。
    会议最后通过锡兰提出的一项提案，这个提案把四国“刚果问题”和苏联关于就刚果局势采取紧急措施的建议都列入议程。
    美国代表华兹沃斯又想制造新的障碍，他以苏联“同刚果事件有关”为幌子企图剥夺苏联代表主持安全理事会会议的权利。
    美国代表的谬论遭到了苏联代表佐林的驳斥。
    在晚间会议上，安理会邀请了马里、几内亚、印度尼西亚、喀麦隆、南斯拉夫和刚果（首都在利奥波德维尔）的代表参加理事会的讨论。波兰和苏联代表都声明说，它们的政府不认为应邀来的刚果人是刚果人民的真正代表。
    联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德在晚间会议上第一个发言。
    哈马舍尔德在发言中没有只字谴责蒙博托匪帮逮捕卢蒙巴总理的罪行。
    他表示反对在刚果军队，也就是蒙博托武装匪徒的地位巩固之前，把“联合国军”撤出刚果。
    哈马舍尔德为了掩饰联合国干涉刚果内政、支持颠复卢蒙巴政府的活动，竟大肆诽谤刚果人民，他居然说，目前的刚果局势是“刚果政治领袖和刚果人民失败”的结果。
    不顾苏联和波兰代表坚持继续辩论的要求，会议通过阿根廷的建议，休会到8日再举行。
