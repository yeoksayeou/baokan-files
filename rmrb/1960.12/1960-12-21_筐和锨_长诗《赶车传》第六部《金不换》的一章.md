Baskets and Spades
    --A Chapter from the Sixth Part of the Long Poem "Gan Che Zhuan" (Cart Driver's Biography), "Jin Bu Huan" (Priceless)
    
    Tian Jian goes up the mountain, this is a commune order; to go up the mountain, Lan Ni was the first to sign up. To go up the mountain, vowing to turn the barren mountain into a paradise; to go up the mountain, vowing to plant the red flag in the blue sky. To be a sower, sowing seeds in the wilderness; to be a bugler, opening the underground treasure palace. Mountain, a red cradle, where countless red eagles were born; mountain, a hero's fortress, where countless red stars rise. Mountains upon mountains, ridges upon ridges, a treasure trove containing thousands of gold, wind whispering, sand settling, the underground treasure palace has jade bottles.

  “I want to be a mountain bird, I want to be a mountain star, to be a spark, planting on the high mountain, cultivating on the high mountain." Plucking hair to make trees, offering sweat to make flowers, taking out my heart, offering it to make a lamp.

  “I want to ask the Great Stone Mountain to make a pearl for the motherland, a gold brick, an iron bone." I want to ask the Great Stone Mountain to go on the Long March with us, discarding the poverty and blankness to be evergreen, wearing a red scarf." Lan Ni's words, the Great Stone Mountain will testify. Revolutionary mountain gave birth to fire people, red cradle nurtured eagles, smart and brave Lan Ni, was born in the flames of war, this female agronomist, is already well-known. The jade bottle left by Pangu, covered with thousands of years of sand and dust, once the sand curtain is lifted, silver flowers will be planted on the mountains. The people's commune has iron hands, opening stone doors, taking jade bottles, the red waterfall surging, to paint the commune's harvest scene. Does Lan Ni have the determination? Old Shi still wants to ask, to see her complexion, is it red or green? To see her eyes, are they bright or dark? Also, to feel her luggage, is it heavy or light? The hoe handle she brought, can it be used as an embroidery needle. Lan Ni smiled happily, and came to explain to the head of the commune-- "If you ask my determination, my heart has fallen on the mountain, living standing on the high mountain, falling buried at the top of the high mountain." Lan Ni is the daughter of the Party, and also the embodiment of hatred, seeing far, drilling deep, is originally an agricultural soldier." Shi Bu Lan he asked--

  "Great Stone Mountain, rocky and rugged, can you go to be a soldier?" Lan Ni answered "Yes!" Shi Bu Lan he asked again--

  "Great Stone Mountain, layer upon layer of ridges, can you manage the wind and clouds?" Lan Ni answered "Okay!"

  "Lan Ni, you said 'Yes', 'Okay', tomorrow I will see you off, send you to marry the high mountain, send you to the high mountain to go on an expedition.

  "Remember you have been married, I haven't sent a dowry, give you a stone mountain, not valuing gold but valuing cultivation."

  "I don't want sandalwood combs, I don't wear peacock feathers, I want a bright mirror, that can hold the blue sky." Shi Bu Lan laughed loudly:

  "Where to find this mirror? Your heart is like it, no need for me to give it.

  "Giving you an iron shovel, giving you a pair of earth baskets, the iron shovel is the golden key, to open the underground palace." The father and daughter were talking, a ball of fire shone into the door, Jin Wa returned to the village after being demobilized, bringing back the call of "fire people." A crowd of people crowded at the door, following Jin Wa across the threshold; Jin Wa heard about the gifts, and said with a smile that he also wanted one. The old head of the commune moved the baskets and the shovel: "Jin Wa, do you think this is okay?" Jin Wa took up the family heirloom,

  "Good, worth a thousand gold." Jin Bu Huan held up "Selected Works of Mao Zedong", came forward and instructed--

  "You are determined to go up the mountain, I will give you a lamp.

  "You bring the golden key, and you must also bring this golden lamp, to be like Comrade Shi Mingwei, forever a red star. "You must go to be a soldier, and also go to be a commander, you must go to be a warrior, and also go to be a singer. "Lamp, a guiding lamp, lamp, a historical compass, the great "Selected Works of Mao Zedong", is such a lamp!" (Attached picture)

    筐和锨
    ——长诗《赶车传》第六部《金不换》的一章
    田间上山去，这是公社一道令；上山去，蓝妮第一个报名。上山去，誓把荒山变乐园；上山去，誓把红旗插蓝天。去作一个播种人，种子播在荒野；去作一个吹号人，打开地下宝殿。山呀红色的摇篮，生过多少红鹰；山呀英雄的堡垒，升起多少红星。重重山，层层岭，万宝囊里有千金，风声声，沙沉沉，地下宝殿有玉瓶。
  “我呀要作山上鸟，我呀要作山上星，要作一粒火种，高山上种高山上耕。“头发摘给它做树，汗水捧给它做花，心呀这心掏出来，献给它做一盏灯。
  “我要请大石山，为祖国作一颗明珠，作一块金砖，作一根铁的骨头。“我要请大石山，跟我们一起长征，丢下穷白万年青，戴上一条红领巾。”蓝妮的这一番话，大石山会来作证。革命山生下火人，红色摇篮养下鹰，聪明勇敢的蓝妮，是在战火中生，这一位女农艺家，大家早已闻名。盘古丢下的玉瓶，蒙着几千年沙尘，沙幕一旦掀开，银花就插在山岭。人民公社有铁手，开石门，拿玉瓶，红色瀑布浪滔滔，来画公社丰收景。蓝妮有没有决心？老石还想问一问，看看她的脸色，是红或者是青？看看她的目光，是亮或者是阴？还要摸摸她的行装，是沉还是轻轻。带的那镢头把子，可否当作绣花针。蓝妮喜笑盈盈，走来对社长说明——“要问我的决心，我的心在山上落下，活着站在高山上，倒了埋在高山顶。“蓝妮是党的女儿，也是仇恨的化身，看得远，钻得深，本是一个农业兵。”石不烂他问——
  “大石山石嶙嶙，你能去作一个兵？”蓝妮回答说“能！”石不烂他又问——
  “大石山层层岭，你能去管风和云？”蓝妮回答说“行！”
  “蓝妮你说‘能’，‘行’，明天我给你送行，送你嫁到高山去，送你高山去出征。
  “记得你已结过婚，我还没送嫁妆，送你一座石山吧，不重黄金重耕耘。”
  “檀香木梳我不要，孔雀羽毛我不挂，我想要一面明镜，能把蓝天装得下。”石不烂哈哈笑道：
  “哪儿来找这明镜？你那颗心倒像呀，不用我来送赠。
  “送你一把铁锨，送你土筐一对，铁锨就是金钥匙，能开那地下宫殿。”父女二人正谈论，一团火光照进门，金娃复员回村，带回“火人”的呼声。门口拥着一群人，跟随金娃跨进门；金娃听说送赠品，笑着说也要一份。老社长搬动筐和锨：“金娃你看行不行？”金娃担起传家宝，
  “好呀，价值千金。”金不换捧上《毛泽东选
  集》，走上前来叮咛——
  “你们决心上山去，我送你们一盏灯。
  “你们带上金钥匙，还得带上这金灯，要像史明伟同志，永作一颗红星。“既要去当士兵，也要去当司令，既要去做武士，还要去作歌人。“灯，指路的长明灯，灯，历史的指南针，伟大的《毛泽东选集》，就是这样一盏灯！”（附图片）
