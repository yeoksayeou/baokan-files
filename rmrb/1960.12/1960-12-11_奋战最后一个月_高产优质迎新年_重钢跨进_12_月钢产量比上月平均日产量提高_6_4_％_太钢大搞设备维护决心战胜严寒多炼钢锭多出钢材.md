Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 10th: Workers at Chongqing Iron and Steel Company have launched a mass movement to comprehensively fulfill or exceed the December and annual plans. In the first week of the final month of 1960, the company achieved new successes in high yield and quality. Steel production in the first six days of December increased by 6.4% compared to the average daily output level of the significantly increased November, and the qualification rate of steel increased by 5.61%; the output of pig iron and steel increased by 1.9% and 21.8% respectively, and the quality was further improved.

In late November, the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company Party Committee fully mobilized the masses and conducted in-depth discussions on the December leap forward plan. Each factory, team, and furnace seat discussed the key points of each process at every level, added new tackling measures, and launched technical performance competitions and "one-dragon" collaboration competitions between factories, workshops, and upper and lower processes. The workers of No. 1 furnace in the Second Team of the First Open Hearth Furnace Plant repeatedly checked the production situation of each furnace of steel and each process in the past and found that the smelting time of one furnace of steel was sometimes more than an hour longer than that of other teams. They delved deeper to find the root cause, prescribed the right medicine, and learned from the advanced experience of other teams in batching and adding cold materials, which immediately shortened the smelting time by about two hours. In the mass movement of "100 Furnaces Without Accidents," No. 2 converter of the Third Converter Plant has created a new record of 300 furnaces without accidents. The in-furnace desulfurization rate of the No. 1 iron melting furnace in the First Team of the Second Converter Plant has been maintained at around 80%, and the external desulfurization of the Dong Tianming team is often maintained at around 50%. The Party Committees of each converter plant have rapidly spread the advanced experience of these typical furnaces to the vast number of workers. As a result, there has been a significant increase in converter furnace life, a significant increase in steel quality, a significant reduction in iron consumption, and a significant shortening of blowing time.

The company's Party organizations at all levels have further strengthened production organization. The company adopted a method of long-term planning and short-term arrangements to make plans and measures more meticulous and solid, and to grasp every team, every furnace of steel, and every process tightly and thoroughly. Cadres in production found that the production of many factories often fluctuated during shift handover and the first shift of each day. In response to this problem, the workers repeatedly studied the matter and put forward the slogan of "grasping tightly from the beginning, taking the initiative from the beginning, and exceeding the quota from the beginning" for each shift every day. Leading cadres at all levels concentrated their main efforts on grasping the political and ideological work and production preparation work of the first shift of each day and the first two hours of each shift to lay the foundation for high output throughout the day and shift. At the same time, each team took the initiative to understand the production situation of the previous shift; each team also took the initiative to prepare for the next shift. Many units have achieved "leaving only experience, not leaving key problems" after work.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, December 10th: Leading cadres of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company went deep into the site and worked with the workers to attack the raw materials and transportation bottlenecks and to intensify equipment maintenance, determined to produce more steel ingots and steel in the last month.

Recently, the temperature in the Taiyuan area has dropped sharply. Ore transported from other places is often frozen in the train cars or material troughs. To rush to unload these frozen ores, company manager Chen Langhuan led thirty cadres and one thousand five hundred basic construction workers and transport workers to form a professional unloading team, working in shifts day and night to blast the frozen ore. Song Minkuan, the secretary of the general branch of the raw materials station, and other leading cadres summarized and promoted the experience of Dong Weisheng's unloading team in diagonal drilling and blasting, which not only improved efficiency but also saved gunpowder. Due to the improved blasting operation method, the efficiency of rushing to unload frozen ore has doubled to two times. Now, the backlog of frozen ore has been completely unloaded, and the newly transported ore has been unloaded as soon as it arrives, greatly shortening the downtime.

In order to prevent open-air production equipment such as coal washing and pipelines from malfunctioning due to freezing, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, in conjunction with checking cold-proof measures, has comprehensively launched a mass equipment maintenance campaign since late November. For example, because the night temperature is low and equipment accidents are prone to occur, maintenance workers have established a night follow-up system to assist production workers in repairing and maintaining equipment at any time. The diesel locomotive of the raw material crushing plant is prone to fire extinguishing accidents in winter. Drivers Li Baosen and Li Erniu constantly tightened the screws that were loosened due to the cold weather and diligently added oil, always maintaining normal operation. Because the equipment was well maintained, the raw material crushing volume of this plant in the first six days of December increased by 30% compared with the average daily output level of the last ten days of last month, creating good conditions for the blast furnace to eat fine materials. Since entering December, the First Steelmaking Plant has universally promoted the experience of No. 3 open hearth furnace in maintaining the furnace body and rapid steelmaking, reducing steel running and leakage accidents. Therefore, the average daily steel output level in the first six days of December increased by 10.6% compared with the same period last month. (Attached Picture)

### 奋战最后一个月　高产优质迎新年  重钢跨进12月钢产量比上月平均日产量提高6.4％  太钢大搞设备维护决心战胜严寒多炼钢锭多出钢材

    奋战最后一个月　高产优质迎新年
    重钢跨进12月钢产量比上月平均日产量提高6.4％
    太钢大搞设备维护决心战胜严寒多炼钢锭多出钢材
    据新华社重庆10日电　重庆钢铁公司职工掀起了全面完成或超额完成12月份和全年计划的群众运动。全公司在奋战1960年最后一个月中的第一周，取得了高产优质的新成绩。12月头六天的钢产量比大幅度增长的11月份平均日产水平提高6.4％，钢的合格率提高5.61％；生铁和钢材的产量分别提高1.9％和21.8％，质量也有进一步提高。
    在11月下旬，重钢党委就充分发动群众，深入讨论了12月份的跃进计划。各厂、各班组、各炉座，层层讨论了每一道工序的关键，增添了新的攻关措施，开展了技术表演赛和厂与厂、车间与车间及上下工序之间的“一条龙”协作赛。平炉一厂二大班一号炉的职工，反复检查了过去每一炉钢，每一道工序的生产情况，发现有时一炉钢的冶炼时间比其他班要长一个多小时。他们就深追下去，找到病根，就对症下药，学习其他班配料和进冷料的先进经验，使冶炼时间立即缩短了两个小时左右。在“百炉无事故”的群众运动中，转炉三厂二号转炉已创造出三百炉无事故的新纪录。转炉二厂一号化铁炉一班的炉内脱硫率，保持在80％左右，董天明小组的炉外脱硫经常保持在50％左右。各转炉厂党委已把这几个典型炉的先进经验，迅速传播到广大职工中去。因此，出现了一个转炉炉龄大提高，钢的质量大提高，铁耗大降低，吹炼时间大缩短的局面。
    公司各级党组织还进一步加强了生产组织工作。全公司采取长计划短安排的办法，使计划和措施更加周密、扎实，使每一个班、每一炉钢、每一道工序都抓紧抓狠一抓到底。干部在生产中，发现了很多厂在交接班和每天第一班的生产经常波动。针对这个问题，职工们反复地进行了研究，提出了每天每班“一开始就抓紧，一开始就主动，一开始就超额”的口号。各级领导干部并集中主要精力抓好每天第一班和每班前二小时的政治思想工作和生产准备工作，为全天、全班的高产打下基础。同时，各班都主动了解上一班的生产情况；各班也都主动为下一班作好准备。许多单位已做到下班“只留经验，不留关键”。
    据新华社太原10日电　太原钢铁公司领导干部深入现场，和职工群众一道猛攻原料、运输关，大搞设备维护，决心在最后一个月中，生产更多的钢锭和钢材。
    最近，太原地区气温急剧下降。从别地运来的矿石，经常冻结在车皮或料槽里。为了抢卸这些冻结矿石，公司经理陈瑯环带领三十名干部和一千五百名基本建设工人、运输工人，组成抢卸专业队，日夜轮班爆破冻结的矿石。原料站总支书记宋民宽等领导干部，总结和推广了董维生卸车组斜打眼爆破的经验，既提高效率，又节约火药。由于改进了爆破操作方法，抢卸冻结矿石的工作效率提高了一倍至两倍。现在，积压的冻结矿石已经全部卸完，新运来的矿石已做到随到随卸，大大缩短了停车时间。
    为了防止洗煤、管道等露天生产设备因冷冻发生故障，从11月下旬以来，太钢结合检查防寒措施，全面开展了群众性的设备维护活动。如夜间气温低，容易发生设备事故，检修工人就建立了夜间跟班制度，协同生产工人随时检修和维护设备。原料破碎厂的柴油机车，冬天容易发生灭火事故。司机李保森、李二牛就随时拧紧因天冷而松动的螺丝，勤加油，始终保持了正常运转。由于设备维护得好，这个厂12月头六天原料破碎量比上月下旬平均日产水平提高了30％，给高炉吃精料创造了良好条件。第一炼钢厂进入12月以来，普遍推广了三号平炉维护炉体和快速炼钢的经验，减少了跑钢、漏钢事故，因而12月头六天钢的平均日产水平，比上月同期提高了10.6％。（附图片）
