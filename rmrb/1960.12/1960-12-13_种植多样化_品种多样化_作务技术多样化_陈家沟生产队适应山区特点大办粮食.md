Diversified Planting, Diversified Varieties, Diversified Farming Techniques
Chenjiagou Production Team Adapts to Mountainous Features to Vigorously Develop Grain Production

(Reported by our newspaper) Qu Lianghe, a famous agricultural labor model in the Ankang Special Zone of Shaanxi Province and the deputy director of the Wenwu Commune, leads the Chenjiagou Production Team. Based on the characteristics of the mountainous area, they implement diversified planting methods, diversified crop varieties, and diversified farming techniques according to local conditions. This has led to rapid annual growth in grain production and further development in other productions.

In the production practice of the past two years, the team has continuously conducted scientific summaries, making the farming system in the mountainous area increasingly substantial and complete. The core of so-called diversified planting is to expand the planting area. During last year's autumn planting, in addition to replanting all existing land that could be replanted, changing one crop a year to two crops, four new positions were opened up to expand the planting area: First, mixed cropping and intercropping of staple and miscellaneous grains were implemented. Peas were interplanted in more than 200 mu of wheat. The rhizobia of the peas were beneficial to wheat growth, and the wheat could act as a "scaffold" for the peas, thus achieving a double harvest of wheat and peas. Second, the more than 700 mu of tung oil forest and timber forest were deeply plowed and dug to sow wheat or peas, implementing intercropping of forest and grain. Third, the fallow period was shortened, and rational crop rotation was carried out. The 210 mu of fallow land were changed from two crops a year to three crops, and from two crops in three years to four crops. Fourth, broad beans were intercropped in the hardpan fields.

The so-called diversified varieties mean adapting to local conditions and planting whatever can be planted and whatever is suitable. For example, they concluded that wheat is a "stable harvest crop" that can be planted on plains, slopes, and mountains, but whether the selected varieties are suitable or not has a great impact on the yield of the coming year. They used five or six varieties of wheat seeds, implementing multi-variety combination. Based on the characteristics of each improved variety, such as cold resistance, drought resistance, fertilizer tolerance, tillering and lodging resistance, and maturity date, they used different seeds for different land and different land for different seeds. This is conducive to giving play to the strengths and roles of various excellent varieties. For example, the "Qitouhong" improved variety, which is fertilizer-tolerant, has hard stems, and strong lodging resistance, is planted on plains and paddy fields; the "Xiahezao" improved variety, which can climb slopes, is drought-resistant, and has strong tillering ability, is planted on slopes; and the "Sanyuehuang" and "6028" varieties, which mature early, are planted in tung oil forests.

The so-called diversified farming techniques mean that a series of measures such as land preparation, fertilization, close planting, sowing techniques, and management must also be adapted to local conditions. For example, they used deep plows and spades to deeply plow the flat land, leveled and finely cultivated the land, and vigorously carried out gardenization; the slopes were deeply plowed with plows, rocks were picked up, and retaining walls were built to vigorously carry out terracing; the mountainous areas were deeply plowed with hoes, stone retaining walls were built to conserve soil, and stage-like development was vigorously carried out. "Row sowing with spaced rows" was implemented on the plains; "ditch sowing" was implemented on the slopes; and "dense cluster planting" was implemented in the mountainous areas, with sowing rates varying from 15 jin, 18 jin, to 20 jin per mu. In fertilization, it was ensured that more fertilizer was applied to poor land and less fertilizer was applied to fertile land; cake fertilizer and cow manure were applied to the shady slopes, human manure and pig manure were applied to the sunny slopes, and cinder fertilizer was applied to the mountainous areas.

In the past two years, the Chenjiagou Production Team has guaranteed annual growth in grain production due to the implementation of the "three diversifications" farming system adapted to local conditions.

The above-mentioned advanced farming system also solved the contradiction between forests and grain competing for land. In the past two years, the team has afforested more than 50 mu. Because more than 300,000 trees were planted on the edges of fields and stone ridges, the grain planting area was not affected. Moreover, the intercropping of forests and grain allowed the trees to conserve water and soil, and the leaves to be used for composting, which was beneficial to the growth of crops. The annual land preparation, fertilization, and weeding for crops were also conducive to the growth of trees and more fruit production, ensuring both increased grain production and promoting the great development of forestry.

Due to the significant increase in grain production, especially the expansion of the summer grain area, the pig raising industry has also seen further development.

Recently, the Party branch and the team committee, in accordance with the Party Central Committee's instructions on "vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain production," and in accordance with the "three diversifications" farming system, have made further plans to expand the wheat and cotton area from more than 800 mu to more than 1,100 mu, and appropriately increase the planting of oil crops and miscellaneous grains. At the same time, reasonable arrangements have been made for the stubble of spring and summer planting next year. Now, all team members are implementing the measures in the fields according to the "three diversifications" system and the production plan, striving to harvest more grain in the summer of next year.

### 种植多样化  品种多样化  作务技术多样化  陈家沟生产队适应山区特点大办粮食

    种植多样化  品种多样化  作务技术多样化
    陈家沟生产队适应山区特点大办粮食
    本报讯　陕西安康专区著名的农业劳动模范、文武公社副社长屈良和领导的陈家沟生产队，根据山区特点，因地制宜实行种植方式多样化，作物品种多样化，作务技术多样化，促使这个生产队粮食产量年年迅速增长，其他生产也得到了进一步发展。
    在最近两年的生产实践中，这个队不断地进行科学总结，使山区的耕作制度愈来愈充实、完善。所谓种植多样化，中心环节是抓扩大播种面积。去年秋播中，除对现有土地能复种的全部复种，改一年一作为两作外，又新开辟了四个阵地，来扩大播种面积：一是实行主、杂粮混作和套种。在二百多亩小麦中带种豌豆。豌豆的根瘤菌肥有利小麦生长，小麦又可以给豌豆起到“搭架”的作用，因此，得到了麦、豆双丰收。二是在七百多亩油桐林、木材林中深犁深挖，播种小麦或豌豆，实行林粮间作。三是缩短轮歇地期限，进行合理倒茬，在二百一十亩轮歇地中，改一年两种为三种；改三年两种为四种。四是在板田里套种一料胡豆。
    所谓品种多样化，就是因地因种制宜，能种啥就种啥，啥种合适就种啥种。如他们就总结出：小麦是个“稳收作物”，无论平地、坡地、山地都能种植，但品种选用得适宜与不适宜，却与来年产量的好坏有很大关系。他们采用的麦种，就有五、六个品种，实行多品种组合。根据各个良种的特性，如耐寒、耐旱、耐肥程度，分蘖和抗倒伏能力、成熟期迟早等，看地用种，看种种地。这就有利于发挥各个优良品种的特长和作用。例如对耐肥、秆硬、抗倒伏力强的“齐头红”良种，就种平地和水田；对能扒坡、耐旱、分蘖力强的“夏河造”良种，就种坡地；在桐林地里就种成熟期早的“三月黄”和“六○二八”等品种。
    所谓作务技术多样化，就是在土地整理、施肥、密植、播种技术和管理等一系列措施上，也要因地制宜。如他们对平地就用深耕犁和锨深翻，平细整地，大搞园田化；坡地就用犁深翻，拣石头，砌楞坎，大搞梯地化；山地就用镢深翻，垒石坎保土，大搞台阶化。平地实行“分行条播”；坡地实行“开沟条播”；山地实行“密窝点播”，播种量也有每亩用种十五斤、十八斤、二十斤不等。在施肥中，掌握瘦地施多，肥地施少；饼肥牛粪上阴坡，人粪猪粪上阳坡，火肥渣肥上山地。
    两年来，陈家沟生产队由于因地制宜，实行“三多样”耕作制度，保证了粮食产量年年增长。
    由于上述先进的耕作制度，也同时解决了林、粮相互争地的矛盾。两年来，全队共造林五十余亩。由于是在地边、石埂边植树三十多万株，并未影响到粮食播种面积，而且林粮间作，树木起到蓄水保土，树叶沤肥，有利农作物生长，而每年给庄稼整地、施肥和锄草，又利于树木生长和多结果实，既保证了粮食增产，又促进了林业的大发展。
    由于粮食生产大大提高，特别是夏杂粮面积扩大，养猪事业也有了进一步发展。
    最近，党支部和队委会，根据党中央“大办农业、大办粮食”的指示精神，按照“三多样”的耕作制度，作了进一步规划，把小麦棉花面积由八百多亩扩大到一千一百多亩，并适当增种油料和杂粮作物，同时合理安排了明年春、夏种的茬口。现在，全队社员正根据“三多样”制度和生产计划将措施落实到田，力争明年夏季多收粮食。
