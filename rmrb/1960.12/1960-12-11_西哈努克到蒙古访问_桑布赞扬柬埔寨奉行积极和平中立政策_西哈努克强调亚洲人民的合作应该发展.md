Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, December 10th: At the invitation of the Presidium of the Great People's Hural and the government of the Mongolian People's Republic, Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk arrived in the Mongolian capital, Ulaanbaatar, by special train this morning for a state visit.

Those who greeted Prince Sihanouk and his entourage at the station included: Jambyn Sambuu, Chairman of the Presidium of the Great People's Hural of Mongolia; Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, Chairman of the Council of Ministers; Zhamsrangiin Sambuu, Chairman of the Great People's Hural; Damdinjavyn Maydar, Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers; and Luvsandorjiin Sandagdorj, Minister of Foreign Affairs. Xie Fusheng, the Chinese Ambassador to Mongolia, and other foreign diplomatic envoys to Mongolia also greeted them at the station.

After Prince Sihanouk alighted from the train, accompanied by Sambuu and Tsedenbal, he reviewed the guard of honor and accepted flowers from Mongolian children.

Chairman Sambuu and Prince Sihanouk delivered speeches at the station square.

In his welcoming speech, Sambuu said, "We are pleased to note that the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Mongolian People's Republic and the Kingdom of Cambodia has opened a new era for the development of friendly cooperation between the Mongolian and Cambodian peoples. We sympathetically observe and are pleased that the peace-loving Cambodian people, under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk, have achieved national liberation and independence through struggle and are successfully consolidating it. Your government is pursuing a policy of active peace and neutrality." Sambuu expressed his conviction that the state visit of all the distinguished Cambodian guests led by Prince Sihanouk to Mongolia will not only consolidate and develop relations between Mongolia and Cambodia but also make an important contribution to maintaining and consolidating peace in Asia and the world.

In his speech, Prince Sihanouk said, "Although our two countries have different social systems, we share a common desire to safeguard friendly cooperation among all peoples on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence. Therefore, we believe that it is an urgent matter for the Mongolian People's Republic, which, like us, hopes to strive for peace, to exercise its rights in the United Nations." He said that in order to achieve this legitimate demand, Cambodia will do everything in its power. He said: "Our two countries are Asian countries. Geographically, between our two countries are our common great friend—the friendly People's Republic of China and neutral Laos. We believe that the peoples of all Asian nations should develop brotherly cooperation on the basis of respecting the Bandung principles in order to safeguard common freedom, eliminate the danger of war, and make the people prosperous and happy."

Prince Sihanouk also mentioned that his and Cambodian Prime Minister Pho Proeung's, Supreme Council of the Throne Vice-Chairman Nhiek Tioulong, First Deputy Prime Minister [name unclear], and other ministers' visits to various socialist countries are of great significance.

    西哈努克亲王下车后，在桑布和泽登巴尔陪同下检阅了仪仗队，并接受了蒙古儿童的献花。
    桑布主席和西哈努克亲王在车站广场上讲了话。
    桑布致欢迎词说，“我们满意地认为，蒙古人民共和国和柬埔寨王国之间建立了外交关系，开辟了发展蒙柬人民友好合作的新时期。我们同情地看到并感到高兴的是，爱好和平的柬埔寨人民在西哈努克亲王领导下用斗争取得了民族解放独立，并正顺利地巩固它。您的政府正在奉行积极的和平中立政策。”桑布表示确信，由西哈努克亲王率领的柬埔寨全体贵宾在蒙古进行国事访问，不仅能够巩固和发展蒙柬两国间的关系，而且对维护和巩固亚洲和世界的和平事业作出重要贡献。
    西哈努克亲王在讲话中说，“我们两国的社会制度虽不相同，但是我们在和平共处原则的基础上有着维护各国人民友好合作的共同愿望，因此我们认为，同我们一样希望争取和平的蒙古人民共和国在联合国行使自己的权利是一件刻不容缓的事情”。他说，为了实现这个合法要求，柬埔寨将竭尽自己的一切努力。他说：“我们两国都是亚洲国家，在地理上，我们两国之间有着我们的共同的伟大朋友——友好的中华人民共和国和中立的老挝，我们认为亚洲各民族人民应该在尊重万隆原则的基础上发展兄弟般的合作，以便维护共同的自由，消除战争危险，使人民繁荣幸福”。
    西哈努克亲王还谈到，他和柬埔寨首相福·波伦、王位最高委员会副主席宾努、第一副首相?·刁隆以及其他大臣这次访问各社会主义国家，具有巨大意义。
