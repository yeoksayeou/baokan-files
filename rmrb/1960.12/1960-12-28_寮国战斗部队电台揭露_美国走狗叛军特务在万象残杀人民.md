Laotian Combat Forces Radio Reveals
American Stooge Rebel Secret Agents Massacring People in Vientiane

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 27th: The Laotian Combat Forces Radio broadcast on the evening of the 26th that the Lao government army and the people are bravely resisting the "mopping up" operation conducted by ten battalions of the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak rebel army, under the command of American officers and including Thai and South Vietnamese troops, north of Vientiane.

The radio station said that on December 24th, one enemy force advanced towards San Phan Nang, another force advanced towards Phou Khouay, reaching a point four kilometers away, and on December 25th, a third enemy force reached Tha Lat Khouang.

The radio station said that despite the rebels launching offensives under the cover of tanks, armored vehicles, and artillery, and with the cooperation of American and their stooge troops, they were resisted by the government army and armed people along the way. Bridges on Highway 13 and the Vientiane-to-Phong Hong road were destroyed by the people.

In addition, in Xieng Khouang Province, the Laotian Combat Forces ambushed a company of rebels between Na Kang and Na Bo on December 20th, inflicting heavy losses on the rebels.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 27th: According to a broadcast by the Laotian Combat Forces Radio today, news from Vientiane indicates that secret agents of American imperialism and its stooges, the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak clique, are conducting large-scale searches, arrests, and persecution of the people of Vientiane.

The radio station said that recently, some young students were killed by secret agents calling themselves the "Siho Army" on the charge of being "Kong Le's troops." Since the rebel attack on Vientiane, more than one hundred young students have been killed by them.

The radio station revealed that the people of Vientiane all know that Captain Siho was an officer in the intelligence bureau of the former Phoui Sananikone reactionary government. He used to be a secret agent for the American Ambassador to Laos and directly received American salaries. After Captain Kong Le launched the coup, Siho fled to Savannakhet and, according to the instructions of his American masters and the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique, led a battalion stationed in Sikhiu County, Thailand. Siho sent troops to sneak into Vientiane to carry out sabotage activities, but they were wiped out by Captain Kong Le's army.

The radio station said that on December 13th, Siho's army crossed the Mekong River with the Thai army and attacked Vientiane.

The radio station pointed out that the above facts once again prove that, in addition to helping the Phoumi-Boun Oum clique occupy Vientiane, American imperialism also keeps some secret agents like Siho, etc., to massacre and persecute the Lao people.

The Laotian Combat Forces Radio also broadcast today that, according to people who evacuated from Vientiane, on December 15th, when the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique attacked Vientiane, they killed two monks six kilometers north of Vientiane. At the same time, the Thai invading troops, who cooperated with the rebel attack, looted the people's property on a large scale. The atrocities of the rebels and invading troops aroused great indignation among the people.

    寮国战斗部队电台揭露
    美国走狗叛军特务在万象残杀人民
    新华社河内27日电　寮国战斗部队电台26日晚上广播，老挝政府军和人民正在英勇阻击富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞叛军在美国军官指挥下的泰国、南越军队等十个营在万象北面进行的“扫荡”。
    电台说，12月24日，一支敌军向山番纳进军，另一支军队向逢衡进军，并到达离逢衡四公里的地方，12月25日，第三支敌军到达杜拉空。
    电台说，尽管叛军在坦克、装甲车和大炮的掩护下发动进攻，并得到美国及其走狗军队的配合，但他们沿途却受到政府军和人民武装的阻击，十三号公路和万象到丰洪路上的桥梁，都被人民破坏。
    此外，在川圹省，寮国战斗部队在12月20日伏击了纳刚和纳波之间的叛军的一个连，使叛军受到严重损失。
    新华社河内27日电　据寮国战斗部队电台今天广播，来自万象的消息说，美帝国主义及其走狗富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞集团的特务分子正在大肆搜捕、迫害万象人民。
    电台说，最近，有一些青年学生被自称为“西河兵”的特务分子加以“贡勒军队”的罪名而杀死。自从叛军进攻万象以来，被他们杀死的青年学生已有一百多人。
    电台揭露，万象人民都知道西河上尉是前松萨尼特反动政府情报局的军官。他过去曾当过美国驻老挝大使的密探，并且直接领取美国的薪金。在贡勒大尉发动政变后，西河跑到沙湾拿吉，并根据他的美国主子和富米—文翁叛国集团的指示，率领了一个营驻扎在泰国锡香梅县。西河曾派军队潜入万象，进行破坏活动，但被贡勒大尉的军队消灭。
    电台说，12月13日西河的军队同泰国军队一起渡过湄公河，进攻万象。
    电台指出，上述事实，再次证明美帝国主义除了帮助富米—文翁集团占领万象之外，它还豢养一些特务如西河等，残杀和迫害老挝人民。
    寮国战斗部队电台今天还广播，据撤出万象的人民说，12月15日，富米—文翁叛国集团进攻万象的时候，在万象市以北六公里的地方杀死了两位僧侣。同时，配合叛军进攻的泰国侵略军大肆抢劫人民的财产。叛军和侵略军的暴行激起了人民的极大愤慨。
