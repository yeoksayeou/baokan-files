The Story of the Camellia

I. Wedding Celebration

September, wild geese fly in formation,
Hibiscus blooms with dewdrops, chrysanthemums just turning yellow.
A suona horn announces joyous news,
A wedding celebration at the pine tree courtyard.
The bride is long in appearing,
Relatives and friends ask what's wrong.
The mother-in-law is about to answer,
When the groom bursts in with a hoe over his shoulder:
"The weather station just reported,
A typhoon may strike the village,
Team Leader Camellia instructed,
The assault team to assemble at Azure Dragon Ridge!"
In a flash, all the wedding guests, young and old, disperse,
Leaving only the two sets of in-laws facing each other,
The mother of the bride sees the mother-in-law picking up carrying baskets,
And, smiling, rolls up her sleeves:
"Do you think I have fewer hands?
Let's go, sisters, and help!"
The story just begins here,
Listen as I slowly tell it...

II. Settling Down

The Camellia girl's surname is Liu,
Born in the year of the Rabbit, just turned twenty.
She volunteered to settle in Maple Tree Slope three years ago.
Her cousin Lihua had old ideas,
Saying Camellia was a "bookworm,"
And said: "Carp don't live in stagnant ponds,
Good girls don't go to barren mountain valleys,
It's much better to find a job in the city,
Why go to the countryside to wield a hoe!"
Camellia's mother was undecided,
And wanted to keep her daughter at home.
But Camellia was determined to farm,
And wouldn't turn back despite countless words of persuasion:
"Agricultural labor is the most glorious,
Cousin's words are unfounded!
The river always flows east,
Your daughter is determined to go."
Finally, her brother had good ideas,
"Right! Vigorously develop agriculture, with grain as the foundation,
Root yourself in the countryside and you'll definitely become red!"

III. Apprenticeship

This day, Camellia came to the production team,
Members welcomed her with applause,
The branch secretary said: "The countryside is the broadest of all lands,
May you advance together with the villagers."
Saying that, he introduced many new friends,
And also introduced her to a master, "Iron Man,"
This was a young man, black and strong,
Real name Lu Ruikang,
In labor, proficient in all "eighteen martial arts,"
In temper, could not hide a word.
He said: "If you're not just 'newly built latrine that smells good for three days,'
I guarantee I'll teach you everything!"

IV. Training

It's hard to start with rice husks and rope twisting,
The first few months were a bit unaccustomed,
Backaches were tolerable,
But it was difficult to arrange farming life,
Camellia was intent on innovation,
But all seven experiments failed.
It happened that her mother came to visit,
And asked her daughter: "Why don't you speak your mind?"
Her daughter said: "I'm not afraid of hardship,
But I didn't expect old habits to be so hard to change,
Could it be that planting willows with great effort yields no results,
Am I not farming material after all?"
Ruikang got angry when he heard this:
"It is wrong to be timid and afraid of difficulties!
If you are afraid of difficulties, go back to the city,
If you have perseverance, show some ambition!"
Her mother got a little angry when she heard this:
"Camellia, your master is too harsh!"
Camellia smiled and didn't answer,
The next day Ruikang's chatterbox opened again:
"Please forgive my bad attitude,
But never forget the branch secretary's words;
The flowers you plant with hardship are especially fragrant,
We should bear any great difficulties!"
Camellia was touched when she heard this,
And quickly said: "It was wrong of me!"

V. Growth

Camellia is determined to be a pioneer,
Daring to learn, dare to do, and dare to think.
Her cousin kindly came to visit,
And was flustered when she saw Camellia:
"People say you are learning to farm,
How come you live in a livestock farm?
Holding a marking gauge and doing carpentry,
You look like a mason from head to toe,
What exactly are you learning?"
Camellia smiled and casually weaved a bamboo basket:
"If you want to get high grain yields,
What does it matter what name or profession you have!"
Her mother came to visit several times,
And each time she felt more comfortable in her heart.
No need to inquire much in the village,
Everyone praises Camellia as a good girl;
The masses love her and the Party cultivates her,
The old lady now knows that her past ideas were wrong.
When she came, her daughter was so delicate,
Now she is fatter, healthier and more beautiful,
Peonies transplanted to the wilderness,
Grow stronger in the wind and frost.

VI. Feelings

Plum blossoms announce spring for thousands of miles,
Birds fly out of the nest and soar into the sky,
Camellia has only settled down for three years,
Her name has spread throughout Eastern and Western Ridge.
The young men count the heroes,
Ruikang said Camellia is amazing.
Someone joked on the spot:
"She's first in your heart."
Ruikang quickly said: "Don't talk nonsense!
I can't afford to climb up to such a good girl."
But who knew that on the auspicious day of August 9th,
A happy event happened in the melon shed,
Camellia shyly spoke her heart,
Lu Ruikang was surprised, embarrassed, and happy,
Thinking in his heart: Where can I find such an object?
Saying in his mouth: "Uh... I agree..."

VII. Conclusion

Singing to here, we turn back again,
The two in-laws walk out carrying baskets.
Suddenly, many people came from outside,
Coming to the countryside to support agriculture and seize a bumper harvest.
Lihua was also in the crowd,
First blushing, then speaking:
"The Party's instructions have opened my mind,
I will go to the agricultural front and not fall behind:
Camellia, I want to worship you as a teacher,
I also want to dedicate myself to the construction of the motherland."
Mother said: "Grain is truly a treasure among treasures,
Ten thousand kinds of truths are in it.
Camellia's path is right,
Everyone must listen to Chairman Mao's words and follow the Party!"

    茶花的故事
    沈祖安一、闹房九月大雁排成行，芙蓉带露菊初黄。一支唢呐传喜事，松树台门闹新房。新娘迟迟不露面，三亲四友问短长。婆婆正要把话答，新郎背锄往里闯：“气象台刚才有报告，恐有台风过村庄，茶花队长有吩咐，突击队集合青龙岗！”一霎眼老少贺客都走散，只剩下两老亲家相对望，老丈母看见婆婆挑箩筐，笑着捋袖撩衣裳：“难道说我就少双手？走，老姐妹一起去相帮！”故事这里刚开头，听我慢慢往下讲……二、落　户茶花姑娘本姓刘，属兔的二十才出头。三年前初中刚毕业，志愿落户枫树? 。表姐莉华有旧思想，说茶花是个“书踱头”，说道：“鲤鱼不住死水塘，好姑娘不上荒山沟，在城里找个工作多少好，又何必去农村捏锄头！”茶花妈听了没主意，一心想把女儿留。那茶花立志要务农，千言万语不回头：“农业劳动最光荣，表姐的话没来由！江水总归向东流，女儿立志定要走。”到底哥哥思想好，“对！大办农业粮为本，扎根农村定红透！”三、拜师这天茶花来到生产队，社员们欢迎齐鼓掌，支书说：“农村的天地最宽广，愿你和乡亲们一起往前闯。”说着他介绍了许多新朋友，又给他引荐了个师父“铁金刚”，这是个又黑又壮的小伙子，大名三字吕瑞康，论劳动“十八般武艺”件件精，论脾气有话半句不能藏。他说：“若不是‘新造茅坑三日香’，包教包会我承当！”四、锻炼砻糠搓绳起头难，头几月有点不习惯，腰骨酸痛倒犹可，耕田的生活难安排，茶花有心闹革新，七次试验都失败。恰巧妈妈来探望，问女儿：“为啥口不开？”女儿说：“受累吃苦我不怕，想不到老习惯这样难更改，难道说苦心栽柳不结果，莫非我不是这块务农材？”瑞康一听心头火：“胆怯畏难不应该！你若怕困难就回城里去，你若有恒心就拿出点志气来！”妈妈听了有点气：“茶花啊，你这个师父太厉害！”茶花笑着不回答，到明天瑞康话匣又打开：“我态度不好请原谅，可千万别把支书的话都忘怀；辛苦种的花儿特别香，有天大的困难我们应担当！”茶花听了心感动，忙说：“是我不应该！”五、成长茶花立志做闯将，敢学敢做又敢想。表姐好心来探望，一见茶花着了忙：“人家说你学种田，怎么住在畜牧场？手拿着墨斗做木工，浑身上下倒像泥水匠，你到底学点啥行当？”茶花笑着顺手编竹筐：
  “要叫粮食出高产，管什么名称论什么行！”妈妈几次来探望，次次心里更舒畅。进村不用多打听，都夸茶花是个好姑娘；群众爱护党培养，老太太才知过去想法欠妥当。看女儿来时多娇嫩，现在是又胖又健更漂亮，牡丹移植原野里，风霜里长得更茁壮。六、心事报春梅花香千里，出巢鸟儿冲天飞，茶花落户才三年，名传岭东与岭西。小伙子屈指论英雄，瑞康说茶花了不起。有人当场开玩笑：“你的心里她第一。”瑞康忙说：“别胡说！这样的好姑娘我可高攀不起。”又谁知八月初九好天气，喜事发生在瓜棚里，茶花含羞说出心头话，吕瑞康又惊又窘又欢喜，心里想：这样的对象哪里找？嘴里说：“呃……我同意……”七、结束唱到这里又回头，两亲家挑着箩筐往外走。忽然间外面来了不少人，下乡来支援农业夺丰收。莉华也在人群里，先红脸，后开口：“党的指示开心窍，奔赴农业战线不落后：茶花啊，我要拜你做老师，我也要为祖国建设献身手。”妈妈说：“粮食真是宝中宝，千万种道理都在里头。茶花的道路走得对，人人要听毛主席话，跟党走！”
