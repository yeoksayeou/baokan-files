Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 19th – After the Cuban revolutionary government successively nationalized American monopoly capital enterprises in the past year, it is steadily overcoming various difficulties created by American monopoly capitalists, so that these enterprises, which already belong to national property, are steadily increasing production and playing their due role in the cause of developing the national economy.

In the year that is about to pass, the Cuban government nationalized American enterprises controlling important economic sectors of Cuba, such as electricity, petroleum, mining, banking, and sugar, and on October 25th, announced the complete seizure of the remaining 167 American enterprises. Thus, all American enterprises in Cuba, with a total value of approximately twelve billion US dollars, became national property, ending the ugly history of these enterprises extracting high profits from the Cuban people every year.

During the process of the Cuban people successively nationalizing these American enterprises, American monopoly capitalists withdrew all American technical personnel from these enterprises. At that time, reactionary American newspapers constantly propagated that without these Americans, the Cuban government and the working class would be unable to manage and operate these enterprises. However, the fact is that during the nationalization of American enterprises, not a single factory had ever suspended production.

Power plants, sugar mills, and cement factories, which require relatively high management technology, are completely managed and operated by the Cubans themselves.

Moreover, the Cuban working class, freed from American capital exploitation, also fully demonstrated their talents and vigorously promoted production forward. By making full use of existing equipment and practicing strict economy, they produced many commodities that previously could only be imported from the United States. For example, the Cuban Steel Company, a joint venture between Cuba and American capital, previously only produced steel bars and oil drums. At the end of 1958, the production of this company almost completely stopped, and all Americans had withdrawn. After the victory of the revolution, Cuban workers, relying on their own strength, not only gradually restored the production of this factory, but also expanded the variety of its products. Currently, this factory not only produces steel bars, but also produces agricultural tools, vehicles, steel beams, and rivets, which are listed on the American "embargo" list. The workers of this factory also repair a passenger car every day, using the bodies of old cars and buses to manufacture oil tankers to supply the needs of the petroleum and transportation departments. Currently, this factory is planning to expand. In the first month after the Owen-Illinois Glass Factory became a state enterprise, it increased production by 6.5%. Currently, it supplies 90% of the country's glass consumption.

The production rate of the Concordia Textile Factory doubled after it was nationalized. Swift Food Company used to import broken machines from the United States, while charging high prices on the books in order to evade funds and profits. Before being nationalized, this company lost 18,000 pesos per month. Only three months after nationalization, it not only cleared all its debts, but also had a profit of 80,000 pesos.

After being nationalized, American enterprises have been assigned to relevant national institutions for centralized management. Currently, after the Industrial Department of the National Land Reform Committee of Cuba took over these enterprises, its factories and mines have reached more than 600, accounting for about 75% of the total number of factories and mines in Cuba; enterprises in the railway and highway departments are led by the Ministry of Communications. Under these circumstances, Cuban national economic institutions can better serve the cause of developing the national economy through unified allocation and arrangement. For example, in the past, except for the three-month production season, the equipment of Cuba's 161 sugar mills was idle for most of the year. Currently, under centralized management, all the repair shops of these sugar mills are used to manufacture parts needed by other industrial departments during the time outside the production season.

After the nationalization of American enterprises, the political status of Cuban workers and their political awareness have simultaneously improved. In many enterprises, workers have participated in management and have established cooperative relations with domestic technical personnel. After abolishing the system of punishing workers previously established by American capitalists in the country's largest textile factory, the "Aliguanapo" Textile Factory, the workers' labor discipline has greatly improved. At the same time, due to workers actively participating in technical design work, the skills of some skilled workers have improved to the level of technical personnel.

On the eve of nationalization, American capitalists deliberately increased the wages of workers in some enterprises, plotting to create divisions among the workers and create difficulties for the Cuban revolutionary government. Currently, the broad masses of workers have realized the imperialists' conspiracy and have launched a sharp struggle to eliminate the influence of this malicious practice of American imperialism. The Cuban Electrical Workers Union recently purged some saboteurs hidden in the union. Currently, this struggle is still going on. At the same time, workers are fighting against American agents and counter-revolutionaries with a high degree of vigilance. Each factory has a militia squad composed of progressive workers, who are responsible for guarding the factory during their spare time. The workers' slogan is: "Every factory is a Sierra Maestra (Cuban revolutionary base - editor's note); every worker is a warrior defending the motherland!"

### 古巴美资企业国有化后生产不断发展  产量提高，品种增加，在国家集中管理下为发展民族经济服务  工人摆脱资本剥削，参加企业管理，政治地位和觉悟大大提高

    古巴美资企业国有化后生产不断发展
    产量提高，品种增加，在国家集中管理下为发展民族经济服务
    工人摆脱资本剥削，参加企业管理，政治地位和觉悟大大提高
    新华社哈瓦那19日电　古巴革命政府在过去一年中陆续把美国垄断资本的企业收归国有以后，正在不断克服美国垄断资本家制造的各种困难，使这些已经属于民族财产的企业稳步提高生产，并在发展国民经济的事业中发挥它们应起的作用。
    在即将过去的一年中，古巴政府把控制古巴的电力、石油、矿业、银行、糖业等重要经济部门的美国企业收归国有，并且在10月25日宣布全部征收残存的一百六十七家美国企业。这样，美国在古巴的总值约为十二亿美元的全部企业就变为民族的财产，从而结束了这些企业每年从古巴人民身上榨取高额利润的丑恶的掠夺历史。
    在古巴人民把这些美国企业陆续收归国有的过程中，美国垄断资本家曾经撤走这些企业中的全部美国技术人员。当时，美国反动报刊不断宣扬，没有这些美国人，古巴政府和工人阶级将无法管理和运转这些企业。但是，事实是，把美国企业收归国有期间，它们之中没有一家工厂曾经中止生产。
    发电厂、糖厂、水泥厂这样需要较高管理技术的大工厂完全由古巴人自己管理和运转着。
    不仅如此，摆脱了美国资本剥削的古巴工人阶级还充分发挥了他们的才智，生龙活虎地把生产推向前进。他们在充分利用原有设备和厉行节约的情况下，生产出许多以前只能依靠美国进口的商品。例如，古巴和美国资本合营的古巴钢铁公司以前只生产钢条和油桶。在1958年年底，这家公司的生产几乎完全停顿，所有美国人都撤走了。革命胜利后，古巴工人依靠自己的力量，不仅逐渐恢复了这家工厂的生产，还扩大了它的产品的品种。目前，这家工厂不仅生产钢条，而且生产农具、车辆、钢梁和铆钉等列在美国“禁运”单上的产品。这家工厂的工人每天还修理一辆客车，利用旧轿车和公共汽车的车身制造运油车，供应石油和运输部门的需要。目前，这家工厂正在计划扩建中。欧文·伊利诺斯玻璃厂在成为国家企业后的第一个月中，就使生产提高了6.5％。目前，它供应了全国90％的玻璃消费量。
    孔科尔迪亚纺织厂在被收归国有后，它的生产率提高了一倍。斯威夫特食品公司过去从美国进口破机器，而在账册上开高价，以便抽逃资金和利润。在被收归国有之前，这家公司每月亏损一万八千比索。在收归国有后仅三个月，它不仅清偿了全部债务，并且有了八万比索的赢利。
    美国企业在被收归国有以后已经划归有关的国家机构集中管理。目前，古巴土地改革全国委员会工业部在接管这些企业后，它所属的厂矿已达六百多家，占古巴全国厂矿总数的75％左右；铁路和公路部门的企业则归交通部领导。在这种情况下，古巴国家经济机构就有可能通过统一调配和安排，使这些企业更好地为发展民族经济的事业服务。例如，以前除了三个月的生产季节以外，古巴的一百六十一家糖厂的设备在一年的大部分时间中被闲置不用。目前，在集中的管理下，这些糖厂的所有修配车间在生产季节以外的时间里，都被利用来制造其他工业部门需要的零件。
    在美国企业国有化之后，古巴工人的政治地位和他们的政治觉悟同时提高了。在许多企业中，工人们参加了管理，并且同本国的技术人员建立了合作关系。全国最大的纺织厂“阿里关纳波”纺织厂在废除了美国资本家以前订立的惩罚工人的制度以后，工人的劳动纪律有了很大的改进。同时，由于工人们积极参加技术设计工作，有些熟练工人的技术已经提高到技术人员的水平。
    在国有化的前夕，美国资本家在一些企业中别有用心地增加了工人的工资，阴谋借以在工人中制造分裂和为古巴革命政府制造困难。目前，广大工人群众已经认识到帝国主义者的阴谋，并且展开尖锐的斗争来消除美帝国主义者这种恶毒做法的影响。古巴电力工会最近就清洗了一些隐藏在工会中的破坏者。目前，这一斗争仍在继续进行。与此同时，工人们正以高度的警惕性同美国特务以及反革命分子进行斗争。每个工厂都有由进步的工人组成的民兵小队，他们在工余时间担负着警卫工厂的任务。工人们的口号是：“每一个工厂都是一座马埃斯特腊山（古巴革命根据地—编注）；每一个工人都是一名保卫祖国的战士！”
