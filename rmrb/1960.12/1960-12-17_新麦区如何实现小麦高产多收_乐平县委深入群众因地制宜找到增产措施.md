    How Can Xinmai Area Achieve High Yield and Bumper Harvest of Wheat?
    Leping County Party Committee Deeply Enters the Masses and Finds Measures to Increase Production According to Local Conditions
    Timely ditching and drainage of wheat in paddy fields to ensure suitable soil moisture during the growing period; intercropping, overlapping, and interplanting wheat in dry land, implementing supplementary irrigation and single irrigation, and increasing fertilizer application; strengthening frost and animal damage prevention for wheat in mountain depressions.
    (Our report from Nanchang, December 16) Leping County, Jiangxi Province, is vigorously grasping field management of wheat in paddy fields, intercropped fields, and mountain depression fields, striving to achieve high yields from every wheat field next year.
    This year, the area sown with wheat in Leping County has increased more than threefold compared to last year, reaching 200,000 mu, breaking the traditional view that "rice in the south, wheat in the north, wheat cannot be grown in the south." After breaking through the multiple planting barrier, the question is how to strive to achieve high yield and bumper harvest. The Leping County Party Committee believes that breaking through the high-yield barrier is more difficult than breaking through the multiple-planting barrier. The reasons are: first, wheat growth is currently encountering unfavorable natural conditions such as early frost, early freezing, waterlogging in paddy fields, and drought in dry fields; second, not only is the area large, but there is also a lack of experience in managing wheat. In response to these situations, the Leping County Party Committee proposed high-yield management measures for wheat during the main growing season in winter.
    Maintaining appropriate water volume in paddy field areas is one of the important ways to promote early growth, early development, early maturity, and high yield of wheat, and to solve the problem of rice and wheat competing for harvest time. The more than 50,000 mu of wheat sown in rice fields in Leping County already have the contradiction of harvesting and early rice transplanting competing for the season. The solution to this contradiction, in addition to implementing rice seedling cultivation and extending the growth period of rice seedlings, so as not to hinder the early rice transplanting time due to late wheat maturity and late harvesting, is to vigorously grasp winter field management of wheat and fully solve the current problem of excessive water content in rice fields, coupled with excessive rainfall, affecting the normal growth of wheat. In order to improve the level of wheat management, the County Party Committee, led by the First Secretary, organized a large number of investigation and research teams to go deep into more than 2,900 production teams throughout the county to seek advice and learn from friends, and summarize the experience of managing wheat in paddy field areas. The main method is: ditching and drainage to discharge excess water, especially rainwater, from the fields, in order to maintain appropriate soil moisture during the winter wheat growth period and prevent the root system from rotting due to the heavy rain in the southern winter and spring seasons, which affects high wheat yields. After this experience was promoted in various paddy field wheat areas, all paddy field wheat in the county achieved uniform and strong seedlings.
    Managing intercropped, overlapping, and interplanted dryland wheat is an even more complex issue. The county has more than 50,000 mu of wheat that is intercropped, overlapping, and interplanted in radish, red clover, and sugarcane fields. How to irrigate these intercropped crops to meet the different water requirements of different crops; at the same time, these intercropped fields have high multiple cropping indices and require a particularly large amount of fertilizer. These are all new problems in this winter's wheat field management. In order to solve these problems, the county organized all agricultural technical cadres and experienced farmers to summarize the experience of managing intercropped wheat fields on a field-by-field, household-by-household, and person-by-person basis, and found that oilseed rape and green manure require less water, while wheat requires more water. The problem of different water requirements of different crops was solved by combining supplementary irrigation and single irrigation. So-called supplementary irrigation means irrigating all crops such as large and small wheat, oilseed rape, and green manure together, once every half month. The so-called single irrigation means irrigating wheat alone once every half month, and the irrigation method is to release water according to the wheat rows. After this experience was widely promoted, all 50,000 mu of intercropped wheat in the county received timely irrigation. In order to make this irrigation method regular and ensure that fields with high multiple cropping indices have sufficient fertilizer, the county, while doing a good job in winter field management, also conscientiously implemented the "three guarantees and one reward" policy, mobilized the production enthusiasm of each contracting unit, and launched a high-yield wheat competition centered on water conservation and fertilizer conservation, so that all winter-sown wheat met high-standard management requirements. For example, after the "three guarantees and one reward" policy was implemented in the Songjia Production Team of Lingang Commune, not only did all 1,400 mu of large and small wheat in the team weeded three times, but also an average of 30 dan of farm manure was applied per mu. In order to achieve actual production exceeding the contracted production, the members of the Fuxia Team worked hard on four water ponds despite the strong winds, and picked out more than 90,000 dan of pond mud, ensuring the fertilizer needs of all wheat.
    Preventing frost, preventing freezing, and preventing animal damage are important measures to manage wheat in mountain depression areas and ensure high yields. Leping County has 100,000 mu of wheat distributed in mountain depressions in the mountainous areas. In the past, the main reasons for low wheat yields here, in addition to unfavorable natural conditions such as early frost, early freezing, and cold climate, were wild animal damage and being too far from the village to manage. Therefore, adhering to the principle of combining current and long-term interests, the County Party Committee transferred more than 10,000 cadres to these mountainous areas to strengthen the leadership of the production teams there, and established more than 50,000 mu of high-yield demonstration plots in mountain depressions with different soil qualities and climates, such as high mountains, low mountains, and red soil mountains, and summarized management experiences such as frost prevention, freezing prevention, and cold prevention from the high-yield demonstration plots. These experiences are: 1. Apply more cattle manure to prevent cold and keep warm; 2. Cover with weeds to prevent frost, freezing, and animals; 3. Establish new residential points to facilitate diligent and careful management. In order to achieve these three management measures, all mountainous areas in the county, combined with winter fertilizer accumulation, organized more than 10,000 people to go to the mountains to cut grass, and ensured that all wheat fields were covered with weeds. At the same time, a large number of transferred cadres and members were mobilized to establish residential points in the mountain depressions, and cattle and pig farms were established there to raise cattle with mountain grass and pigs with wild plants, and to fertilize wheat with pig and cattle manure, which not only solved the problem of being too far from the village to manage, but also ensured the warmth and fertilizer needs of 100,000 mu of wheat.

    新麦区如何实现小麦高产多收
    乐平县委深入群众因地制宜找到增产措施
    水田小麦适时开沟排水，保证生长时期土壤湿度适宜；旱地混种、套种、间种小麦实行套灌、单灌，增施肥料；山坳地区小麦加强防霜冻、兽害
    本报南昌16日电　江西乐平县狠抓水田、套种田、山坳田小麦田间管理，争取明年丘丘麦田获得高产。
    乐平县今年已经播种的小麦比去年增加了三倍以上，达到了二十万亩，打破了“南方米、北方麦，南方不能种小麦”的历来看法。多种这一关突破以后，就是如何争取实现高产多收了。中共乐平县委认为突破高产关比突破多种关更困难。原因是：一，当前小麦生长中遇到了早霜、早冻，水田多渍，旱田干旱等不利的自然条件；二，不仅面积大，而且管理小麦的经验不足。乐平县委针对这些情况提出了冬季小麦主要生长期中的高产管理措施。
    保持水田地区小麦适当水量，是促使小麦早生、早发、早熟、高产，解决收割期稻麦争时的重要办法之一。乐平县在水稻田中播种的五万多亩小麦，在播种时就存在着收割与早稻插秧争季节的矛盾。解决这一矛盾的办法，除实行水稻寄秧、延长水稻秧苗生长期，不因小麦迟熟晚割而妨碍早稻插秧时间外，就是大抓小麦冬季田间管理，全力解决当前因稻田含水量大，再加雨水过多而影响小麦正常生长的问题。为提高小麦的管理水平，县委以第一书记为首组织了大批调查研究组，深入到全县二千九百多个生产小队，求师访友，总结管好水田地区小麦经验。主要办法是：开沟排水，把水稻田里过多的水、特别是雨水，排出田间，以保持冬小麦生长期间的土壤湿度适当，并防止南方冬春两季多雨，污烂根须，影响小麦高产。这一经验在各水田小麦区推广后，全县水田小麦全部达到苗齐、苗壮。
    管好混种、套种、间种的旱田小麦，更是一个复杂的问题。这个县有五万多亩小麦是套种、混种、间种在萝卜、红花草、甘蔗田里的，怎样灌溉这几种套种作物，才能满足不同作物不同的需水量；同时这些套种田复种指数高，需肥量特别大，这些都是今年冬季麦田管理中的新问题。为解决这些问题，全县组织了所有农业技术干部和老农，一丘、一户、一人地总结管好套种小麦田的经验，找到了油菜、绿肥需水量小、小麦需水量大的特点，并以套灌、单独灌相结合的办法解决了不同作物需水量不同的问题。所谓套灌，即不分大小麦、油菜、绿肥等作物一起放水灌溉，一个半月一次。所谓单独灌溉，即半个月单独灌溉一次小麦，灌溉方法是按麦行放水。这项经验普遍推广以后，全县五万多亩套种小麦都得到了适时灌溉。为使这一灌溉方法经常化，并保证复种指数较高的田有足够肥料，全县又在搞好冬季田间管理的同时，认真执行了“三包一奖”政策，调动了各包产单位的生产积极性，掀起了以保水、保肥为中心的小麦高产竞赛，使全部冬种小麦达到了高标准管理要求。如临港公社宋家生产大队“三包一奖”政策贯彻执行后，全队一千四百多亩大小麦不仅普遍锄了三次草，而且每亩平均追施了三十担农家肥。甫下小队社员为实现实产超包产，冒着大风车干了四口水塘，挑出了九万多担塘泥，保证了全部小麦的追肥需要。
    防霜、防冻、防止兽害，是管好山坳地区小麦、保证高产的一项重要措施。乐平县有十万亩小麦分布在大山地区的山坳里。过去这里小麦低产的主要原因除早霜、早冻、气候寒冷等不利的自然条件外，就是野兽危害和离村太远管不过来。为此，县委本着当前与长远利益相结合的原则，下放一万多名干部到这些山区，加强这里的生产小队的领导，并在高山、低山、红土山等不同土质、不同气候的山坳里建立了五万多亩丰产方，从丰产方中总结了防霜、防冻、防寒等管理经验。这些经验是：一、多施牛栏粪，防寒保温；二、复盖杂草，以防霜、防冻、防兽；三、建立新的居住点，以便勤管细管。为实现这三项管理措施，全县各山区结合冬季积肥，组织了一万多人上山砍草，并做到了丘丘麦田都盖上了杂草。同时，动员了大批下放干部和社员到山坳里建立居住点，并在那里建立牛猪场，用山草养牛、用野生植物养猪，以猪牛栏粪肥麦，从而既解决了因离村远管不过来的问题，也保证了十万亩小麦保温保肥需要。
