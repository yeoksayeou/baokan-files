Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 22nd: The French Communist Party held a rally at the Mutualité hall in Paris on the evening of the 21st to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the French Communist Party. Several thousand people attended the rally.

    French Communist Party General Secretary Maurice Thorez spoke at the meeting. Thorez reviewed the history and development of the French Communist Party over the past forty years. He said, "The reason we have been able to make progress is because we have Marxism-Leninism as our infallible compass. Some people absurdly claim that the rich doctrine of Marxism-Leninism is outdated, but in fact, there is no idea in the world that is more modern than communism. The recent meeting of representatives of eighty-one Communist and Workers' Parties in Moscow once again brilliantly confirmed this."

    Thorez also spoke about the brilliant achievements of socialist countries in all fields, the collapsing colonial system, the increasingly acute contradictions of imperialism, and the struggles of the French Communists against personal autocracy and for democracy and social progress.

    Speaking on the Algerian question, Thorez pointed out that there is only one way to achieve peace in Algeria, and that is to negotiate with the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria on the terms of a ceasefire and guarantees of self-determination. He exposed the deceptive nature of De Gaulle's proposed "referendum" and pointed out that this so-called "referendum" cannot lead to peace but can only lead to the continuation of the war, so the only answer to it is "no." He called on people to resolutely oppose the "referendum" scheduled for January 8th.

    巴黎庆祝法共建党四十年
    新华社巴黎22日电　法国共产党21日晚在巴黎互助大厅举行集会，庆祝法国共产党成立四十周年。参加集会的有好几千人。
    法国共产党总书记多列士在会上讲了话。多列士回顾了法国共产党建党四十年的历史和发展，他说：“我们之所以能取得进展，是由于我们有马克思列宁主义作万无一失的南针。有人胡说马克思列宁主义这一丰硕的学说已经过时，其实世界上没有比共产主义思想更新的思想。不久前在莫斯科举行的八十一个共产党和工人党代表会议，再一次辉煌地证实了这一点。”
    多列士还谈到社会主义国家在各方面所取得的辉煌成就，殖民主义体系正在崩溃，帝国主义矛盾日趋加剧以及法国共产党人为反对个人专权、为争取民主和社会进步等而进行的斗争。
    在谈到阿尔及利亚问题时，多列士指出，要在阿尔及利亚实现和平只有一个办法，那就是同阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府就停火条件和自决保证达成协议进行谈判。他揭露了戴高乐所提出的“公民投票”的欺骗性质，并且指出，这个所谓“公民投票”不能导向和平只能导致战争的继续，所以对此的唯一答复是“不”。他号召人们坚决反对预定在1月8日举行的“公民投票”。
