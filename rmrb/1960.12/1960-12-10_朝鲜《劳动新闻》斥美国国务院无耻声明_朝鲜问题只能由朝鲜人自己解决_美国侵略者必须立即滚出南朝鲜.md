Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 9th. The Korean newspaper *Rodong Sinmun* published a commentary today on the shameless statement made by the U.S. State Department on the 7th, condemning the U.S. imperialists for obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea, and demanding that the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops immediately get out of South Korea with all their weapons of murder, and immediately disband the ugly tool of aggression of U.S. imperialism—the "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea."

The commentary said that the proposal for the peaceful reunification of Korea put forward by the Eighth Session of the Second Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has received active support from the broad masses of people at home and abroad. However, the U.S. imperialists felt extreme unease and anxiety. On December 7, the U.S. State Department even issued a so-called statement, slandering the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China, and attributing the responsibility for the failure to achieve Korean reunification as if it lay with our side. This is completely a case of "the thief crying 'stop thief!'"

The commentary emphasized that today, it is the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops who are occupying South Korea and trying to obstruct even the slightest contact and exchange between North and South Korea. If the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops withdraw from South Korea, there is no doubt that Korea would have been peacefully reunified long ago. In order to defend its aggressive actions of continuing to occupy South Korea, the U.S. State Department ridiculously describes its arrival in South Korea, thousands of miles across the ocean and far from the U.S. mainland, as "defense." The commentary said that Korea belongs to the Korean people, not to the American rogues. The so-called "defense" of the U.S. imperialist aggressors is nothing but a synonym for aggression and plunder.

The commentary said that the shameless statement of the U.S. State Department is a self-confession of the fact that the U.S. imperialist aggressors are the chief culprits in obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea. It can only make it clearer to the people of all countries that as long as the U.S. imperialists continue to赖在(lai zai) South Korea, all the tragedies in South Korea cannot be avoided, and the peaceful reunification of Korea cannot be realized.

The commentary emphasized: "The U.S. imperialists have no reason to continue赖在(lai zai) South Korea and must get out immediately. The Korean question can only be resolved independently by the Korean people themselves, and no foreign interference is allowed. Today, the Korean people have a firm belief that they must, through united struggle, force the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops to withdraw from South Korea and realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland. Any provocative conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists to obstruct the struggle of the Korean people is bound to be bankrupt."

    朝鲜《劳动新闻》斥美国国务院无耻声明
    朝鲜问题只能由朝鲜人自己解决
    美国侵略者必须立即滚出南朝鲜
    新华社平壤9日电　朝鲜《劳动新闻》今天就美国国务院7日的无耻声明发表评论，谴责美帝国主义阻挠朝鲜和平统一的行为，并且要求美帝国主义侵略军带着一切杀人武器立即从南朝鲜滚出去，立即解散美帝国主义的丑恶的侵略工具——“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”。
    评论说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国第二届最高人民会议第八次会议提出的关于和平统一朝鲜的方案得到了国内外广大人民的积极支持。但是，美帝国主义者却感到极度的不安和焦燥。12月7日，美国国务院还发表了什么声明，诬蔑朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、苏联和中华人民共和国，把没有实现朝鲜统一的责任说成似乎在于我们方面。这完全是“贼喊捉贼”的把戏。
    评论强调指出：今天，强占南朝鲜、力图阻挠南北朝鲜之间的哪怕是一点点的接触和往来的，就是美帝国主义侵略军。如果美帝国主义侵略军从南朝鲜撤走，毫无疑问，朝鲜早就和平统一了。美国国务院为了替它继续强占南朝鲜的侵略行动作辩护，竟可笑地把它来到隔着大洋、远离美国本土成千上万里的南朝鲜，说成是什么“防御”。评论说，朝鲜是朝鲜人的，不是美国佬的。美帝国主义侵略者所谓的“防御”，只不过是侵略和掠夺的代名词。
    评论说，美国国务院的无耻声明，正是不打自招地承认了阻挠朝鲜和平统一的元凶是美帝国主义侵略者。它只能向各国人民更加清楚地说明，只要美帝国主义者继续赖在南朝鲜，就不能免除在南朝鲜出现的一切惨象，就不能实现朝鲜的和平统一。
    评论强调说：“美帝国主义再没有任何理由继续赖在南朝鲜，必须立即滚出去。朝鲜问题只能由朝鲜人自己自主地来解决，不容许任何外来势力的干涉。今天，朝鲜人民有着坚强的信心，一定要以团结的斗争，迫使美帝国主义侵略军撤出南朝鲜，实现祖国的和平统一。美帝国主义企图阻挠朝鲜人民斗争的任何挑衅阴谋必将遭到破产。”
