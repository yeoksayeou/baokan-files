Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, December 7th. The government of the People's Republic of Mongolia today issued a statement regarding the United Nations Security Council's renewed veto, under the manipulation of imperialist countries, of the discussion of the admission of the People's Republic of Mongolia to the United Nations, saying: "The Mongolian government expresses its righteous indignation and firm condemnation of the colonialist and imperialist countries, primarily the United States, for once again adopting a policy of discrimination against the People's Republic of Mongolia."

The statement pointed out that the obstruction by the United States and its NATO followers, Britain, France, Italy, and others, of the discussion of Mongolia's admission to the United Nations, not only exposes their shameless faces to the world but also crudely violates the United Nations Charter.

The statement pointed out that Mongolia's just desire to join the United Nations has been delayed for fourteen years and remains unresolved, which is a shameless conspiracy by imperialist executioners attempting to obstruct the development of our era.

The statement said that the Mongolian government believes that Chiang Kai-shek's illegal occupation of seats in various United Nations organizations, obstructing the People's Republic of China from restoring its legitimate seat in the United Nations, and obstructing Mongolia from joining the United Nations, allows the United Nations to be used by imperialism to achieve their selfish desires, and thus becomes a tool of the United States government. The statement reiterated that the Mongolian government demands the immediate expulsion of Chiang Kai-shek's representatives from the United Nations, the handover of the legitimate seat in this organization to the People's Republic of China, and the admission of the People's Republic of Mongolia to the United Nations.

    帝国主义操纵安理会否决讨论接纳蒙古进入联合国
    蒙古政府谴责帝国主义无耻阴谋
    新华社乌兰巴托7日电　蒙古人民共和国政府今天就联合国安全理事会在帝国主义国家的操纵下再次否决讨论接纳蒙古人民共和国加入联合国问题发表声明说：“蒙古政府对于殖民主义和帝国主义国家、首先是美国再次采取歧视蒙古人民共和国的政策，表示正当的愤慨和坚决的谴责。”
    声明指出，美国及其北大西洋集团的追随者英、法、意等国阻挠讨论蒙古加入联合国的问题，这不仅向全世界暴露了它们的无耻的面目，而且粗暴地违背了联合国的宪章。
    声明指出，蒙古加入联合国的正义愿望已经拖延十四年而仍然没有解决，这是帝国主义刽子手企图阻挠我们时代发展的无耻阴谋。
    声明说，蒙古政府认为，蒋介石非法窃据联合国各个组织的席位，阻挠中华人民共和国恢复它在联合国的合法席位和阻挠蒙古加入联合国，这使联合国被帝国主义利用来达到它们的私欲，因而成为美国政府的工具。声明再次表示，蒙古政府要求立即从联合国中赶走蒋介石的代表，把这一组织中的合法席位交给中华人民共和国，并且接纳蒙古人民共和国加入联合国。
