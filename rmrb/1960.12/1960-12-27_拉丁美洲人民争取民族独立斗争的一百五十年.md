    One Hundred and Fifty Years of Latin American People's Struggle for National Independence
    Zhang Ye
    This year marks the 150th anniversary of the great revolutionary struggle of the Latin American people for national independence. More than a century ago, after arduous battles, the Latin American people shook off the colonial rule of Spain and Portugal and established independent nations. However, they did not achieve true liberation. For more than a hundred years, the Latin American people have never ceased their struggle to win and safeguard national independence and oppose imperialist oppression.
    During the fifteen years from 1810 to 1825, all Spanish and Portuguese colonies in Latin America witnessed widespread revolutions for national independence. The revolutionary war spread extensively from the three centers of Mexico, Venezuela, and Argentina. After more than ten years of heroic fighting, the countries successively declared independence, finally destroying Spanish and Portuguese colonial rule in Latin America.
    As early as the end of the 18th century, the Latin American people had already waged several large-scale uprisings for national independence. Influenced by the bourgeois revolutions in Europe and the Americas at that time, especially the American War of Independence from 1776 to 1783 and the French Revolution of 1789, in 1790, a black people's armed uprising against French colonists first broke out in Haiti. After thirteen years of arduous and complex warfare, the invading armies of the then three colonial powers—France, Spain, and Britain—were defeated. Haiti declared independence in 1804, becoming the first independent country in Latin America. Haiti abolished slavery and the feudal plantation system during the revolution, igniting the flame of the Latin American people's struggle for national independence.
    By the beginning of the 19th century, when Napoleon occupied the Spanish mainland, the revolutionary situation in the Latin American colonies had matured. The revolution broke out in 1810, and the colonial people drove out the Spanish officials. In Venezuela, Buenos Aires (Argentina), Bogota (Colombia), Quito (Ecuador), Santiago (Chile) and other revolutionary centers, power fell into the hands of Creole revolutionary leaders. The Mexican revolution led by Hidalgo in September 1810 had the nature of a large-scale peasant uprising, proposing to return land to the Indians, liberate slaves, and abolish torture and tributes. Hidalgo's revolutionary army rapidly grew to 80,000, sweeping through many parts of the country. Although the armed struggles led by Hidalgo and later by Morelos and Mina were brutally suppressed by the Spanish colonists, Mexico finally declared independence in 1824 due to the people's persistence in guerrilla warfare. However, when the struggle for independence was joined by the broad masses of the people and began to transform into a broad democratic movement with land demands, the Creole leaders of the revolution became afraid of the revolution. Some even turned to support Spanish colonial rule and attack the insurgents. By 1815, the Spanish had restored colonial rule in various colonies. But this was only a temporary victory for the Spanish colonists. Less than a year later, a new revolutionary upsurge swept through the Spanish colonies.
    In the second stage of the anti-Spanish colonial rule, the Central American colonies—Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and El Salvador—formed the United Provinces of Central America and declared independence from Spain in 1821. Because the local Spanish colonial regime was very corrupt and unable to resist, the insurgent people won victory without firing a shot. But the revolutionary struggle on the South American continent was very fierce. During this period, there were two revolutionary centers in the South American colonies: one was Venezuela, and the other was Argentina.
    In Venezuela, Creole Miranda began armed struggle as early as 1806, re-launching the fight in 1810 and declaring the establishment of the Republic of Venezuela in 1811. After the failure, Bolivar led the revolution, establishing the Second Republic of Venezuela in 1818, but soon failed and was forced into exile in Haiti. Later, led by Haiti, 250 revolutionaries landed in Venezuela by boat and re-declared Venezuela's independence in 1818. Bolivar's army liberated Colombia in 1819, Venezuela and Ecuador in 1821, and established the Gran Colombia Republic, including Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador, in 1822.
    In Argentina, the armed revolution led by San Martin broke out as early as June 1810. After six years of hard fighting, the Spanish governor was overthrown, and independence was declared in 1816. In 1817, the Argentine insurgent army under the leadership of San Martin began its famous expedition with Peru as its destination, helping Chile gain independence. In September 1820, he landed in Peru, and in July of the following year, occupied the capital Lima, together with the southward Bolivar-led army, forming a pincer offensive against the last bastion of Spain in South America, Peru. After San Martin retired, Bolivar led the completion of the entire task of liberating Peru. In January 1825, Upper Peru declared independence and was renamed Bolivia in memory of the liberator.
    In this sweeping revolutionary movement in Latin America, Paraguay in South America declared independence in 1811, and Uruguay declared independence in 1828. Under the influence of the Spanish colonial revolution, Brazil also declared independence from Portugal in 1822. At that time, except for Cuba, which gained nominal independence in 1902, the national revolution throughout Latin America was basically completed.
    Although the Spanish and Portuguese colonial system in Latin America collapsed under the persistent armed struggle of the masses, the reactionary classes in these countries usurped the fruits of the people's revolutionary struggle because the independence of the countries was not consolidated. For their own selfish interests, they did not hesitate to collude with foreign forces. Therefore, the aggression of imperialism of Britain, France, Germany, the United States and other countries took the opportunity to invade. By the end of the 19th century, the Latin American countries quickly became semi-colonies under the control of imperialism. Later, American imperialism gradually squeezed out the forces of other imperialisms and intensified its expansion, turning the entire Latin America almost completely into its own backyard.
    Thus, Latin America faced new enemies and began a new course of revolutionary struggle.
    In 1910, the bourgeois democratic revolution broke out in Mexico, overthrowing the Diaz dictatorial regime, which represented the interests of the great landowners and comprador class and served American imperialism. In 1917, it won a constitution that was relatively progressive and democratic at the time, paving the way for the Cardenas government from 1934 to 1940 to implement land reform and nationalize the oil companies and railways belonging to American, British, and Dutch capital. In 1926, the Nicaraguan national hero Sandino launched a seven-year armed struggle against the American occupation forces. This struggle received the support of the entire Latin America and aroused the anger against American imperialism throughout Latin America. In the plantations of the United Fruit Company of Colombia and Central America, and in the mines of the American copper companies in Chile and Peru, the working class launched large-scale strikes against the cruel plunder of American monopoly capital. In 1931, the pro-American dictatorial regime of Ibanez in Chile was overthrown by a powerful people's movement. In 1933, the Cuban people drove away the pro-American dictator tyrant Machado. The long march of Prestes' column in Brazil shook the entire Latin America. In 1944, a major strike by coffee workers in El Salvador turned into a people's uprising. These anti-American struggles of the Latin American people forced the American government to adopt new deceptive means toward Latin America in the 1930s, touting the so-called "Good Neighbor Policy."
    Around World War II, the sentiment of the people of Latin American countries to strive for and maintain independence further increased. In 1944, a people's uprising broke out in Guatemala, led by the national bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie and actively participated in by the working class, overthrowing the pro-American dictatorial regime of Ubico and establishing a more democratic regime. Later, during the presidency of Arevalo from 1945 to 1951, he promulgated a relatively progressive constitution and petroleum law to protect national resources. During the presidency of Arbenz in 1951, he implemented land reform, distributing part of the land occupied by the American United Fruit Company to farmers, developing the national economy, and publicly condemning the United States' conspiracy to interfere in Guatemala's internal affairs. Under the influence of the Guatemalan revolution, the banana workers of Honduras carried out a major strike against the exploitation of American companies. People in Brazil, Chile and other countries also launched extensive struggles to protect national resources and oppose American plunder.
    American imperialism was of course unwilling to see the weakening of its colonial rule in Latin America. The more it suffered setbacks, the more it would carry out frantic counterattacks. After World War II, under the guise of anti-Soviet and anti-communist rhetoric, the United States rudely interfered in the internal affairs of Latin American countries and suppressed the increasingly developing national democratic movement. During this period, the United States supported 14 pro-American dictatorial regimes in Latin America, coerced and lured five countries to sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, and prompted 16 countries to declare the Communist Party "illegal." In 1954, the United States also instigated armed intervention to subvert the democratic government of Guatemala. In the same year, the United States instigated a reactionary military coup in Brazil, forcing President Vargas to commit suicide. American monopoly capital poured a large amount of capital into Latin America, carrying out the most brutal plunder and exploitation.
    However, contrary to the wishes of American imperialism, the Latin American people did not stop their struggle to safeguard national independence and strive for democratic freedom. A new and larger wave of anti-American and anti-dictatorial struggles swept across Latin America after the Guatemalan incident. The dictatorial regimes supported and fully backed by the United States, such as Peron in Argentina, Odria in Peru, Rojas Pinilla in Colombia, and Jimenez in Venezuela, were all overthrown by powerful people's movements. In early 1959, the Cuban people, after a long period of armed struggle, overthrew the Batista dictatorial regime, opening a new page in the second great historical revolution of the Latin American people for national liberation.
    Encouraged by the victorious development of the Cuban revolution, the Latin American national democratic revolutionary movement is moving towards a new upsurge. The people of Nicaragua, Paraguay, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala and other countries have launched armed struggles against the pro-American dictatorial regimes. The Puerto Rican people insist on their struggle for independence. The Panamanian people are unyielding in their struggle to recover sovereignty over the Canal Zone. People in other Latin American countries have also universally launched struggles to protect national resources and oppose the plunder of American monopoly capital. The struggles of the people of all Latin American countries for national liberation have converged into an unstoppable torrent, powerfully shaking the neo-colonialist system of American imperialism in Latin America. The national democratic revolutionary struggle in Latin America is developing and moving towards victory.

    拉丁美洲人民争取民族独立斗争的一百五十年
    章叶
    今年是拉丁美洲人民争取民族独立而进行的伟大革命斗争一百五十周年。一个多世纪以前，拉丁美洲人民经过艰苦的战斗，摆脱了西班牙和葡萄牙的殖民统治，成立了各个独立的国家。但是他们并没有获得真正的解放。一百多年来，拉丁美洲人民为了争取和维护民族独立、反对帝国主义的压迫，一直没有停止过斗争。
    在1810年到1825年的十五年间，拉丁美洲所有的西班牙和葡萄牙的殖民地，普遍掀起了争取民族独立的革命。革命战争主要从墨西哥、委内瑞拉、阿根廷三个中心广泛地蔓延开来。经过十多年的英勇战斗，各国先后宣告独立，终于摧毁了西班牙和葡萄牙在拉丁美洲的殖民统治。
    早在十八世纪末叶，拉丁美洲人民就已经进行过多次大规模的争取民族独立的起义。在当时欧洲和美洲的资产阶级革命的影响下，特别是1776—1783年美国独立战争和1789年的法国大革命的影响下，1790年在海地首先爆发了黑人反对法国殖民者的武装起义。经过十三年艰苦复杂的战争，先后把当时三个殖民强国——法国、西班牙和英国的侵略军队打得落花流水。海地在1804年宣布独立，这是拉丁美洲第一个独立的国家。海地在革命中废除了奴隶制度和封建的大庄园制度，点燃了拉丁美洲人民争取民族独立斗争的火焰。
    到十九世纪初，即拿破仑侵占西班牙本土的时候，拉丁美洲殖民地的革命形势已经成熟。1810年革命爆发，殖民地人民赶走了西班牙的官吏，委内瑞拉、布宜诺斯艾利斯（阿根廷）、波哥大（哥伦比亚）、基多（厄瓜多尔）、圣地亚哥（智利）以及其他革命中心的政权都落到土生白人的革命领袖手里。1810年9月，伊达尔哥领导的墨西哥革命，具有大规模的农民起义的性质，提出把土地归还印第安人、解放奴隶和废除酷刑、纳贡等要求。伊达尔哥的革命军队迅速发展到八万人，席卷了全国许多地方。虽然伊达尔哥以及后来由摩里罗和米那等领导的武装斗争，都曾遭到西班牙殖民者的血腥镇压，在人民坚持游击战争下，墨西哥终于在1824年宣布了独立。但是，当争取独立的斗争有广大的人民群众参加，并且开始转变为广泛的民主运动并提出土地要求的时候，领导革命的土生白人就害怕起革命来，有的甚至转而支持西班牙的殖民统治而进攻起义者。到1815年西班牙人在各个殖民地又恢复了殖民统治。但这只是西班牙殖民者的暂时胜利，不到一年之后，西班牙各殖民地又掀起新的革命高潮。
    在反西班牙殖民统治的第二阶段里，中美洲殖民地——尼加拉瓜、洪都拉斯、哥斯达黎加、危地马拉和萨尔瓦多——组成了中美联合省，并于1821年宣布脱离西班牙而独立。这些地区由于当地西班牙殖民政权非常腐败，无力抵抗，起义人民不费一枪一弹地获得了胜利。但在南美洲大陆上的革命斗争是十分激烈的。这时期在南美洲殖民地有两个革命中心：一个是委内瑞拉，另一个是阿根廷。
    在委内瑞拉，土生白人米兰大早在1806年就开始了武装斗争，1810年重新展开战斗，并在1811年宣布成立委内瑞拉共和国。失败后，由博利瓦尔领导革命，在1818年建立了第二委内瑞拉共和国，但不久又失败被迫流亡海地。后来由海地率领二百五十个革命者乘船在委内瑞利登陆，于1818年再度宣布委内瑞拉独立。博拉瓦尔领导的军队在1819年解放了哥伦比亚，1821年解放了委内瑞拉和厄瓜多尔，1822年成立了包括委内瑞拉、哥伦比亚和厄瓜多尔在内的大哥伦比亚共和国。
    在阿根廷，由圣马丁领导的武装革命，早在1810年6月就已爆发，经过六年的苦战，推翻了西班牙总督而于1816年宣布独立。1817年，圣马丁领导下的阿根廷起义军开始了以秘鲁为目的地的著名的远征，帮助智利获得了独立。1820年9月在秘鲁登陆，第二年7月占领了首都利马，与南下的博利瓦尔领导的军队一起形成对西班牙在南美洲的最后堡垒秘鲁的钳形攻势。圣马丁退休后，在博利瓦尔领导下完成了全部解放秘鲁的任务。1825年1月，上秘鲁宣布独立，为了纪念这位解放者，改名为玻利维亚。
    在这次席卷拉丁美洲的大革命运动中，南美洲的巴拉圭在1811年宣布独立，乌拉圭在1828年宣布独立。在西班牙殖民地革命的影响下，巴西也在1822年宣布脱离葡萄牙而独立。当时，除古巴是在1902年取得名义上的独立以外，整个拉丁美洲的民族革命基本上已经完成了。
    拉丁美洲西班牙和葡萄牙殖民体系虽然在人民群众坚持武装斗争下宣告崩溃，但是由于各国的独立没有得到巩固，这些国家的反动阶级窃取了人民革命斗争的胜利果实，他们为了自私的利益，不惜勾结外国势力，因此，英、法、德、美等帝国主义的侵略又乘机侵入。到十九世纪末，拉丁美洲各国很快又沦为帝国主义控制下的半殖民地。后来，美帝国主义并逐步排挤其他帝国主义的势力，加紧扩张，使整个拉丁美洲几乎完全变成为它的禁脔。
    于是，拉丁美洲又面对着新的敌人，开始了新的革命斗争的历程。
    1910年，墨西哥爆发了资产阶级民主革命，推翻了代表大庄园主阶级和买办阶级利益并为美帝国主义服务的迪亚斯独裁政权，在1917年争得了在当时说来比较进步和民主的宪法，为1934年到1940年卡德纳斯政府实行土地改革和把属于美、英、荷资本的石油公司和铁路收归国有铺平了道路。1926年，尼加拉瓜的民族英雄桑地诺展开了历时七年的反对美国占领军的武装斗争。这一斗争得到了整个拉丁美洲的支援，并引起了遍及整个拉丁美洲的反对美帝国主义的怒火。在哥伦比亚和中美洲各国美国联合果品公司的种植园中，在智利和秘鲁的美国铜矿公司的矿场上，工人阶级纷纷举行反对美国垄断资本残酷掠夺的大罢工。1931年，智利的伊巴涅斯亲美独裁政权被强大的人民运动所推翻。1933年，古巴人民赶走了马查多亲美独裁暴君。巴西普列斯特斯的纵队的长征，震动了整个拉丁美洲。1944年，萨尔瓦多的一次咖啡工人的大罢工转变成了人民的起义。拉丁美洲人民的这些反美斗争迫使美国政府在本世纪三十年代对拉丁美洲开始采取新的欺骗手段，标榜所谓“睦邻政策”。
    在第二次世界大战前后，拉丁美洲各国人民争取和维护独立的情绪有了进一步的增长。1944年在危地马拉爆发了民族资产阶级和小资产阶级领导、工人阶级积极参加的人民起义，推翻了乌比哥亲美独裁政权，建立了比较民主的政权。后来在1945—1951年阿雷瓦洛总统任内，颁布了比较进步的宪法和保卫本国资源的石油法，在1951年阿本斯总统任内，实行了土地改革，把美国联合果品公司霸占的一部分土地分给农民，发展民族经济，并公开谴责美国干涉危地马拉内政的阴谋。在危地马拉革命的影响下，洪都拉斯的香蕉工人进行了反对美国公司剥削的大罢工，巴西、智利等国人民也掀起了保卫国家资源、反对美国掠夺的广泛斗争。
    美帝国主义当然不甘心于它在拉丁美洲殖民统治基础的动摇，它越是遭到失败，就越要进行疯狂反扑。在第二次世界大战以后，美国在反苏反共幌子下，粗暴地干涉拉丁美洲各国内政，镇压日益发展的民族民主运动。在这一个时期，美国在拉丁美洲扶植了十四个亲美独裁政权，威迫利诱五个国家同苏联断绝外交关系，促使十六个国家宣布共产党为“非法”。美国在1954年还策动武装干涉，颠复了危地马拉民主政府。同年，美国又在巴西策动反动军官政变，迫使瓦加斯总统自杀。而美国垄断资本更是向拉丁美洲大量输出资本，进行最残酷的掠夺和剥削。
    但是，同美帝国主义的愿望相反，拉丁美洲人民并没有停止维护民族独立、争取民主自由的斗争，一个新的更大的反美反独裁斗争的浪潮在危地马拉事件之后席卷了整个拉丁美洲。美国扶植和全力支持的独裁政权，像阿根廷的庇隆、秘鲁的俄德利亚、哥伦比亚的罗哈斯·皮尼亚、委内瑞拉的希门尼斯等独裁暴君，都先后被强大的人民运动所推翻。1959年初，古巴人民经过长期的武装斗争，推翻了巴蒂斯塔独裁政权，揭开了拉丁美洲人民争取民族解放的第二次伟大的历史性革命的新页。
    在古巴革命胜利发展的鼓舞下，拉丁美洲民族民主革命运动正在走向新的高涨。尼加拉瓜、巴拉圭、多米尼加、危地马拉等国人民掀起了反对亲美独裁政权的武装斗争。波多黎各人民坚持要求独立的斗争。巴拿马人民不屈不挠地进行收回运河区主权的斗争。拉丁美洲其他国家的人民也普遍掀起保卫民族资源、反对美国垄断资本掠夺的斗争。拉丁美洲各国人民争取民族解放的斗争，已汇合成为不可阻挡的洪流，有力地动摇着美帝国主义在拉丁美洲的新殖民主义体系。拉丁美洲的民族民主革命斗争正在日益发展并走向胜利。
