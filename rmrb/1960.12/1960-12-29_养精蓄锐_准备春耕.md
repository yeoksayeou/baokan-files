    Replenish Energy and Prepare for Spring Plowing

    Skillfully Arrange Farm Work in Winter
    The Zhongfu Production Team of the Zhongfu People's Commune in Lintao County, Gansu Province, implements a small contract system based on the importance, urgency, distance, and proximity of various winter farm tasks. Commune members who complete their production tasks early can rest earlier. Secondly, winter farm work is rationally arranged according to local conditions, time, and people. For example, more work in front of the village and indoors is arranged when it's cold in the morning, and more outdoor work is arranged when it's warmer in the afternoon. Also, light work, heavy work, distant work, close work, and technical work are assigned according to the different situations of men, women, the elderly, and the weak, ensuring that each commune member has appropriate work and can rest well.

    Democratically Formulate a System Combining Work and Rest
    The Qizhuang Brigade of the Hejie People's Commune in Xuchang City, after democratic discussions among commune members, has formulated some specific methods for combining work and rest: fixed holidays every month; sufficient sleep time every day; and the rest or study time is freely arranged by the commune members.
    This brigade paid attention to the following points in assigning work to ensure that there is both work and rest: (1) Matching heavy and light work. After a concentrated effort on heavy work, some lighter work is arranged to allow commune members to recuperate. (2) Pairing strong and weak laborers, using their talents, and helping each other to avoid overworking some weaker laborers. (3) Fully utilizing the spare time on rainy days to reduce the amount of labor on sunny days.

    Ensure Cooks Have Holidays
    The dining hall of the Dingzhuang Production Team of the Zhangzhai Brigade of the Guanzhuang People's Commune in Zhecheng County, Henan, implements a system where cadres and commune members help with cooking to ensure that cooks have four days off each month, so that they can also have work and rest like the commune members.
    When cooks in the Dingzhuang Production Team need to take a break, they can inform the team cadres the day before, explaining the cooking plan and utensils for the next day, while the team cadres who help with cooking delegate their work to other cadres for concurrent management on that day.

    Winter Schedule: "Rest at Both Ends, Focus on the Middle"
    According to the winter climate characteristics, Guangze County, Fujian Province, has adopted the method of "resting at both ends and focusing on the middle" since the beginning of winter to arrange working hours. The specific method is: appropriately delaying the time for commune members to go to work in the morning, and appropriately advancing the time for finishing work in the afternoon, while concentrating efforts on working at noon because the temperature is higher. After the Qiaoting Brigade of the Chafu Commune implemented the "rest at both ends, focus on the middle" working schedule, the attendance rate and work efficiency of the entire team have greatly improved, which not only effectively promotes winter production, but also enables commune members to replenish their energy and prepare for spring plowing.

    Minimize Meetings as Much as Possible
    The Beiguo Management Area (basic accounting unit) of the Wannianqing People's Commune in Fenyang County, Shanxi Province, in order to ensure that commune members and cadres replenish their energy in winter to prepare for spring plowing next year, has decided that, in addition to holding a meeting of commune member representatives once a month (each time not exceeding two hours), no other special meetings will generally be held; cadres' meetings should also be minimized. Meetings that can be avoided must be resolutely avoided, and meetings that must be held must be prepared in advance so that problems can be solved in the shortest possible time.

    养精蓄锐  准备春耕
    冬季巧排农活
    甘肃临洮县中孚人民公社中孚大队各生产队，根据冬季各项农活的轻重、缓急、远近等情况，实行小包工制，社员早完成生产任务可以早休息。其次是因地、因时、因人制宜地合理安排冬季农活。比如早晨天冷多调庄前活、室内活，下午暖和多调野外活，并按男、女、老、弱等不同情况，分别调派轻活、重活、远活、近活、技术活，保证每个社员有恰当的活干，又能休息得好。
    民主制订劳逸结合制度
    许昌市河街公社祁庄大队，经过社员民主讨论，制订了劳逸结合的一些具体办法：每月有固定假日；每天有足够睡眠时间；休息或学习时间，由社员自由支配等。
    这个大队为了认真做到有劳有逸，在派活当中注意了以下几点：（1）把轻重活搭配开，在突击重活之后，接着安排一些较轻的活，使社员从中得到休整；（2）把强劳动力与弱劳动力搭配开，因才使用，互相帮助，避免一些弱劳力劳动过重；（3）充分利用雨天的空隙时间进行劳动，以减轻晴天的劳动量。
    保证炊事员有假期
    河南柘城县官庄公社张寨大队丁庄生产队食堂，实行干部、社员帮厨，保证炊事员每月放四天假，使他们也能和社员一样有劳有逸。
    丁庄生产队炊事员需要休假时，可以在头一天告诉队干部，交代次日做饭的计划和用具，而帮厨的队干部当天工作交给其他干部兼管。
    冬季作息“歇两头、抓中间”
    福建光泽县根据冬季气候特点，入冬以来采取“歇两头、抓中间”的办法，安排作息时间。具体办法是：早上适当推迟社员出工时间，下午适当提早收工，中午因为气温较高，可以集中力量干活。茶富公社桥亭大队实行“歇两头、抓中间”的作息时间后，全队出勤率和工效大大提高，既有效地推动了冬季生产，也能使社员养精蓄锐，迎接春耕。
    尽量精减会议
    山西汾阳县万年青公社北廓管理区（基本核算单位），为了确保社员和干部在冬季养精蓄锐迎接明年春耕，决定除每月召开一次社员代表大会外（每次不超过两小时），一般不开其他专门会议；干部开会也尽量减少，凡能不开的会坚决不开，必须召开的会也一定要做到会前有准备，以便用最短的时间就能解决问题。
