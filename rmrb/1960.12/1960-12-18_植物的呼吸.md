    Plant Respiration
    Zi Geng
    Plants, like animals, need to breathe. Respiration is an important condition for plant life activities. Regardless of spring, summer, autumn, or winter, and regardless of day or night, plants are constantly breathing.

    In contrast to photosynthesis, which synthesizes organic matter, respiration absorbs oxygen, decomposes organic matter, and finally releases carbon dioxide and water, while also releasing energy. Plants use this released energy to maintain their life activities. In winter, the light in northern greenhouses is weak, and the organic matter produced by plant photosynthesis is limited. If the temperature in the greenhouse is too high at this time, respiration will be strengthened, and more things will be consumed, which will cause poor plant growth. The temperature in the greenhouse should be appropriately lowered at this time. When plant leaves wither due to drought, the respiration rate often increases, while photosynthesis decreases, which will reduce the harvest.

    Various plant organs, such as roots, stems, and leaves, also carry out respiration. Hoeing the soil is beneficial to the respiration of the roots. When the soil is loose, the root's ability to absorb water and fertilizer is improved. Some crops are afraid of flooding because the roots lack oxygen for respiration after being submerged in water. Reduced or stopped respiration will lead to poor growth or death.

    Stored seeds, fruits, and vegetables also respire. Therefore, we must pay attention to reducing their respiration during storage to reduce losses. The respiration rate of seeds, vegetables, etc., is very low when stored at low temperatures; however, the temperature should not be too low to avoid freezing damage. As the temperature rises, respiration always increases. Generally, it reaches its maximum at 30-40 degrees Celsius. When the temperature fluctuates from low to high and back again, it will promote plant respiration, especially when moving from low to high temperatures, respiration increases even more drastically.

    Ordinary air-dried seeds have a water content of about 10%-12%, and one kilogram of seeds exhales about 1.5 milligrams of carbon dioxide per hour. When the water content increases to 14%-15%, respiration increases four to five times. When the water content increases to 30%-35%, respiration increases by a thousand times. Cereals release a large amount of energy due to high respiration in humid conditions, which generates heat. Under such circumstances, seeds will not only lose weight, but their quality will also deteriorate, affecting their germination ability.

    The method of storing fruits and vegetables in sealed earthen cellars is very good. In a closed cellar, the carbon dioxide exhaled by the fruits and vegetables cannot be dispersed, which inhibits their own respiration. This method can store fruits and vegetables for a longer period.

    植物的呼吸
    自更
    植物和动物一样也是要呼吸的。呼吸是植物生命活动的重要条件。不论春夏秋冬，也不分白天黑夜，植物总是在不断地呼吸着。
    和合成有机物质的光合作用恰好相反，呼吸作用是吸进氧气，分解有机物质，最后放出碳酸气（二氧化碳）和水，同时释放出能量来。植物就是利用了这种释放出来的能量来维持生命活动的。冬季北方花房里的光照很弱，植物光合作用制造出来的东西是有限的。如果这时花房里的温度太高了，呼吸加强，消耗掉的东西就要多，会引起植物的生长不良。这时应适当降低花房温度。植物在干旱叶子发生萎蔫时，往往呼吸强度提高，而光合作用相反是降低，就会减少收成。
    植物的各个器官根、茎、叶，也是进行着呼吸的。锄地有利于根部的呼吸，土地疏松了，根部吸收水分和肥料的功能就提高了。有些庄稼怕淹，那是因为根部淹水之后缺乏呼吸用的氧气，呼吸减弱或停止，就会生长不良或死亡。
    贮藏着的种子、果实、蔬菜等，也还是有呼吸的。所以我们在贮藏中必须注意降低它们的呼吸，以减少损失。种子、蔬菜等贮藏在低温下呼吸强度是很低的；但温度也不宜过低，免得冻破。随着温度的升高，呼吸也总是增强的。一般情形，在摄氏30—40度时达到最高。当温度发生低低高高的波动时，会促进植物的呼吸，尤其是由低温搬到高温时，呼吸增加得更厉害。
    普通风干的种子含水量约10％—12％，一公斤的种子每小时呼出的碳酸气约1.5毫克。含水量增加到14％—15％时，呼吸增强四至五倍，当含水量增高到30％—35％时，呼吸要增加到一千倍。禾谷类在潮湿情况下，由于呼吸很高放出大量的能量，就会发热。种子在这种情况下不但会减轻重量，而且品质也会变坏，影响发芽能力。
    用密封土窖贮藏果蔬的方法是很好的，在密闭窖中，果蔬呼出来的碳酸气散不出去，抑制了它们自己的呼吸，用这个方法能较长期地贮存果蔬。
