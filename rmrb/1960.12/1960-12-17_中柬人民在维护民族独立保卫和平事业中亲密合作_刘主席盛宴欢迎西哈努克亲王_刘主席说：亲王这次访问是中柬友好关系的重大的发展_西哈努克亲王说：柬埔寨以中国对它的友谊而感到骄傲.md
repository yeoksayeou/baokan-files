At 7:30 PM, His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk, along with His Excellency Penn Nouth, Vice-Chairman of the High Council of the Throne of Cambodia, His Excellency Prime Minister Pho Proeung, His Excellency First Deputy Prime Minister Nhiek Tioulong, and other distinguished guests, accompanied by state leaders such as Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Vice-Chairman Dong Biwu, Chairman Zhu De, Premier Zhou Enlai, and Vice-Premier Chen Yi, entered the brightly lit banquet hall. At this moment, the audience applauded warmly, and the band played a welcoming tune.

Attending the banquet with Prince Sihanouk were his wife, princesses, and princes, some senior Cambodian officials, Cambodian Ambassador to China Leng Ngeth and diplomatic officials from the embassy, members of the Cambodian Economic Delegation, some artists from the Royal Dance Troupe, and Cambodian youth basketball players studying in Beijing.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Prince Sihanouk delivered enthusiastic speeches at the banquet. In his speech, Chairman Liu stated: "The Chinese people, whether in our respective endeavors to safeguard our national independence or in the common cause of defending world peace, are the most loyal friends of the Cambodian people. We are willing to cooperate closely and be forever friendly with the Cambodian people." In his speech, Prince Sihanouk said: "Cambodia is proud of China's friendship." He also said: "Cambodia, united and having repeatedly defeated attempts at sabotage, reaffirms the right of all nations, even small ones, to choose their own path, live according to their own wishes, and refuse to form alliances."

Also attending the banquet were Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, Saifudin, Panchen Erdeni Qoigyi Gyaincain, Lin Feng, Vice-Premiers of the State Council Ulanhu, Li Xiannian, Lu Dingyi, Luo Ruiqing, Xi Zhongxun, Vice-Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Li Siguang, Burhan, Vice-Chairmen of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong, Fu Zuoyi, President of the Supreme People's Court Xie Juezai, and Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng.

In his speech, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese government, and in his personal capacity, once again extended a warm welcome to His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk, His Excellency Penn Nouth, His Excellency Prime Minister Pho Proeung, His Excellency Deputy Prime Minister Nhiek Tioulong, and all the distinguished Cambodian guests who have come to our country with His Royal Highness the Prince. He pointed out that this visit by Prince Sihanouk and other important senior officials from Cambodia is a rare grand occasion in the history of our two countries' relations and another significant development in the friendly relations between China and Cambodia.

Chairman Liu praised Prince Sihanouk and the Royal Government of Cambodia for the firm stance they have taken in pursuing a policy of peace and neutrality. He said that thanks to the outstanding activities and contributions of His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk in defending national independence and safeguarding Asian and world peace, the international status of the Kingdom of Cambodia is rising day by day, the role of the Kingdom of Cambodia in international affairs is constantly being strengthened, and Cambodia's independent and autonomous foreign policy is receiving increasingly broad support and praise.

Prince Sihanouk spoke amidst warm applause. He first expressed his deep gratitude to Chairman Liu Shaoqi. He said that he appreciated Chairman Liu's warm remarks about his country and the Khmer people, which would resonate greatly in his country and once again demonstrated the understanding, friendship, and respect of New China for Cambodia.

Prince Sihanouk said that New China's understanding of Cambodia undeniably demonstrated New China's sincerity and was also the foundation of the mutual trust that guided the relations between our two countries. Only a very few major powers in the world have shown us selfless concern, and China is one of them.

Prince Sihanouk said: "We are very grateful to the People's China because it has not shown us the chauvinism and contempt that many large and medium-sized countries find difficult to avoid when dealing with weaker countries."

The Prince warmly praised, "Future historians will mention everything that New China has done for the long-oppressed peoples of Asia and Africa. They will also mention the full significance of China's contribution to the liberation of an entire part of humanity; that is, liberation from the colonial system, especially from the various psychological states that hinder some people from having confidence in their own destiny, daring to strive for their own future, and from the deeply ingrained prejudice that only the West can make progress in material terms. Chairman Mao said an inspiring sentence: 'The East Wind Prevails over the West Wind.' China's Great Leap Forward is the best proof." Prince Sihanouk also said, "Cambodia is proud of China's friendship because it knows that in this world that is taking shape, nothing can be built without China."

After speeches by Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Prince Sihanouk, the band played the solemn national anthems of Cambodia and China respectively. Their speeches were warmly welcomed by Chinese and foreign guests, and thunderous applause resounded throughout the hall.

    七时三十分，西哈努克亲王殿下和柬埔寨王位最高委员会副主席宾努阁下、首相福·波伦阁下、第一副首相?·刁隆阁下等贵宾，由刘少奇主席、董必武副主席、朱德委员长、周恩来总理、陈毅副总理等国家领导人陪同，一起走进灯光辉煌的宴会厅。这时，全场热烈鼓掌，乐队高奏欢迎乐曲。
    同西哈努克亲王一起出席宴会的，还有他的夫人、公主和王子，柬埔寨的一些高级官员，柬埔寨驻中国大使兰·?特和大使馆外交官员，柬埔寨经济代表团的成员，皇家舞蹈团的部分艺术家，以及在北京学习的柬埔寨青年篮球队员。
    刘少奇主席和西哈努克亲王在宴会上发表了热情的讲话。刘主席在讲话中表示：“中国人民不论在我们各自维护自己的民族独立事业中，或是在保卫世界和平的共同事业中，都是柬埔寨人民的最忠诚的朋友。我们愿意同柬埔寨人民亲密合作，永远友好。”西哈努克亲王在讲话中说：“柬埔寨以中国对它的友谊而感到骄傲”。他还说：“多次击败破坏企图的团结的柬埔寨，重申各个民族，即使是弱小的民族，都有选择自己的道路、按照自己的愿望生活和拒绝结盟的权利。”
    出席宴会的，有全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长郭沫若、黄炎培、彭真、赛福鼎、班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞、林枫，国务院副总理乌兰夫、李先念、陆定一、罗瑞卿、习仲勋，政协全国委员会副主席李四光、包尔汉，国防委员会副主席张治中、傅作义，最高人民法院院长谢觉哉，最高人民检察院检察长张鼎丞等。
    刘少奇主席在讲话时，他代表中国人民和中国政府，并且以他个人的名义，再一次向西哈努克亲王殿下，向随同亲王殿下前来我国的宾努阁下、福·波伦首相阁下、?·刁隆副首相阁下和柬埔寨全体贵宾们，表示热烈的欢迎。他指出，这一次，西哈努克亲王和柬埔寨的其他重要高级官员的来访，这在我们两国关系史上是少有的盛举，是中柬两国的友好关系上的又一个重大的发展。
    刘主席赞扬西哈努克亲王和柬埔寨王国政府在执行和平中立政策中所采取的坚定立场。他说，由于西哈努克亲王殿下在捍卫民族独立、维护亚洲和世界和平事业中的卓越活动和贡献，柬埔寨王国的国际地位正在日益提高，柬埔寨王国在国际事务中的作用正在不断加强，柬埔寨独立自主的外交政策正在受到越来越广泛的支持和赞扬。
    西哈努克亲王在热烈的掌声中讲话。他首先向刘少奇主席表示深切的谢意。他说，我感谢刘主席对我国和高棉人民所作的热情的讲话，这些话将在我国产生巨大的反响，它再一次体现了新中国对柬埔寨的了解、友谊和尊重。
    西哈努克亲王说，新中国对柬埔寨的了解无可争辩地表明了新中国的诚意，也是指导我们两国关系的相互信任的基础。世界上只有很少几个大国对我们表示大公无私的关怀，中国就是其中之一。
    西哈努克亲王说：“我们非常感谢人民中国，因为她没有对我们表现出很多大国和中等国家在对待较弱小的国家时很难避免的沙文主义和鄙视。”
    亲王热情地赞扬说，“未来的历史家将提到新中国为长期受压迫的亚非人民所作的一切。他们也将提到中国对整整一部分人类的解放作出的贡献所具有的全部重要意义；也就是说，从殖民主义制度下解放出来，特别是从阻碍着一些人民对自己的命运具有信心，敢于争取自己的未来的种种心理状态中解放出来，从根深蒂固的认为只有西方才能在物质方面取得进展的这种偏见中解放出来。毛主席说过一句激动人心的话：‘东风压倒西风’。中国的跃进就是最好的证明。”西哈努克亲王还说，“柬埔寨以中国对它的友谊而感到骄傲，因为它知道，在这个正在形成的世界里，没有中国，什么也是建设不起来的。”
    刘少奇主席和西哈努克亲王讲话以后，乐队分别奏庄严的柬埔寨和中国国歌。他们的讲话都受到了中外来宾们的热烈欢迎，全场不断响起雷鸣般的掌声。
