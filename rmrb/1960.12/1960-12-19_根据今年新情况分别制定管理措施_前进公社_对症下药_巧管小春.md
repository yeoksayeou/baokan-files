According to This Year's New Situation, Formulate Management Measures Separately
Qianjin Commune "Diagnoses and Treats" to Skillfully Manage Spring Crops

(Our dispatch) The Qianjin Commune in Chuxiong County, Yunnan Province, in its spring crop management, has adopted different measures based on the different natural conditions, different seedlings, and different crop varieties in different regions, combining active promotion and appropriate control of field management for spring crops.

The spring crops planted by the Qianjin Commune this year have mostly emerged fully and evenly. In order to improve field management, the Commune Party Committee, together with grassroots cadres and experienced farmers, went deep into the fields and, by summarizing past experiences, formulated spring crop management measures adapted to local conditions. In the process of in-depth summary by the Party Committee Secretary in various places, it was found that there are many new situations in the whole commune this year. The most prominent is that drought is severe, the temperature is high, and drought and diseases and insect pests are serious. However, due to the complex natural conditions and the uneven growth of seedlings, the management measures in various places should be different.

After studying the situation of spring crops this year, the Commune Party Committee decided to divide the whole commune into three categories of regions, with the Party Committee Secretary and members taking charge of each area, conducting in-depth research on the characteristics and key points of increasing production in different regions, and strengthening specific leadership over spring crop management.

The first category of areas has better water conservancy conditions and fertile soil, with most of the land belonging to basic farmland. The current focus of these areas is to seize the time to prevent diseases and insect pests, vigorously suppress wheat, top broad beans, control excessive growth of beans and wheat, and ensure avoiding the frost period. According to past experience, diseases and insect pests such as rust, root rot, and aphids pose the greatest threat to these areas and are the greatest threat to spring crop yield increase. Therefore, field management should be centered on disaster resistance.

The second category of hilly and semi-mountainous areas has a more complex situation, with the general characteristic being severe drought. Therefore, the central task of these areas is to combat drought and preserve seedlings, and to take various measures to promote crop growth. The management measures in these areas mainly include actively combating drought through building barrage gates and rationally utilizing small dams and ponds, and seizing the time to apply top dressing during the seedling stage.

The third category of mountainous areas should also focus on combating drought, but in specific practices, the first task is to solve the past habits of extensive cultivation and lack of management, and change the practice of "lazy farming."

After summarizing the characteristics of various regions and different management experiences, the Commune Party Committee recently held on-site spring crop management meetings in the Lvhe, Qingshang, and Yunqing management districts, with the participation of management district branch secretaries, production team leaders, field management personnel, and experienced farmers, to promote the above experiences and discuss and process measures on the spot.

In the discussion, everyone analyzed the complex situation of current production, believing that even within each management district, or even within a production team, the natural conditions are different, so it is necessary to specifically sort them out and take different measures according to different situations. For example, the management districts in river valley plains also have some semi-mountainous or even mountainous production teams, while production teams belonging to semi-mountainous areas also have some river fields. Therefore, management measures in a management district or production team cannot be generalized, and management must be adapted to local conditions, taking care of the fields and seedlings. While studying different management measures for different regions, the Party Committee also conducted in-depth research on the management measures for different soil types and different seedling structures of various spring crops. At present, all parts of the county are adopting appropriate measures to actively manage all winter crops.

### 根据今年新情况分别制定管理措施  前进公社“对症下药”巧管小春

    根据今年新情况分别制定管理措施
    前进公社“对症下药”巧管小春
    本报讯　云南楚雄县前进公社在小春管理中，根据不同地区的不同自然条件、不同苗棵、不同作物品种，分别采取措施，对小春作物进行积极促进和适当控制相结合的田间管理。
    前进公社今年种的小春，大部分出苗齐全、均匀。为了把田间管理搞得更好，公社党委深入田间和基层干部、老农一起，通过总结历年经验，因地制宜制订小春管理措施。党委书记在各地深入总结中，发现全社今年有许多新情况。突出的是由于干旱气温高，旱象和病、虫害严重。但由于自然条件复杂，苗棵成长不一，因此各地的管理措施应当有所不同。
    公社党委研究了今年小春作物的情况以后，决定将全社大体划为三类地区，由党委书记和委员，分片负责，深入研究不同地区的特点和增产关键，加强对小春管理的具体领导。
    第一类地区水利条件较好，土质肥沃，大部分田地属于基本农田。这类地区当前主要是及早抓紧预防病虫害，大抓小麦镇压、蚕豆打尖，控制豆麦疯长，保证躲过霜期。根据历年经验，这类地区锈病、根腐病和蚜虫等病虫害危害最大，是小春增产的最大威胁，因此确定田间管理应以抗灾为中心。
    第二类丘陵地带和半山区地区，情况就比较复杂，总的特点是干旱严重。所以，这类地区的中心任务是抗旱保苗，并且采取各种措施促进作物肥壮。这类地区的管理措施，主要是通过打拦河闸、合理利用小坝塘等办法，积极抗旱，抓紧苗期追肥。
    第三类地区的山区，也要以抗旱为主，但在具体做法上首先是解决过去耕作粗放、不管理的习惯，改变“种懒庄稼”的作法。
    在总结各种地区特点和不同管理经验以后，最近公社党委在吕合、箐上、云庆三个管理区分片召开了有管理区支部书记、生产队长、田间管理人员和老农参加的小春管理现场会，分别推广以上经验，现场讨论加工措施。
    在讨论中，大家都分析了当前生产的复杂情况，认为在各管理区内，甚至一个生产队范围内，自然条件也不一样，也要具体排队，根据不同情况采取不同措施。如河谷平坝地区的管理区也有一些半山区甚至是山区的生产队，而属于半山区的生产队也有一些河田。因而在一个管理区、生产队，管理措施也不能一般化，必须因地制宜，看田、看苗管理。在研究不同地区的不同管理措施的同时，党委还深入研究了各种小春作物的不同土质、不同苗架的管理措施。目前全县各地正采用适宜的措施，积极管理全部冬种作物。
