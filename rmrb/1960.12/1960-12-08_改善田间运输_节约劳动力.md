Comrade Li Fuchun pointed out in his article "Hold High the Red Flag of the General Line and Continue to Advance": "The main key to developing agricultural production and increasing grain production at present is to save labor from all aspects and enrich the agricultural production front, especially the grain production front." Saving labor in every possible way to strengthen the agricultural front is of important strategic significance and an urgent political task.

On the transportation front, short-distance transportation occupies the most labor. How to save labor in rural field transportation, an important part of short-distance transportation, should be given sufficient attention. Field transportation plays a role in every link of agricultural activities, from cultivation, sowing, fertilization to harvesting, and even to warehousing and consumption. At present, the level of agricultural mechanization is still relatively low, and in many areas, field transportation still uses the ancient method of carrying on the back and shoulders, which has been used for thousands of years, occupying a large amount of labor.

Recently, we investigated the issue of field transportation in Baijia, Helin, and Liaoyuan Communes in Liangping County, exploring the labor occupied by field transportation and methods to save it.

These three communes are located in a mountainous area, a hilly area, and a plain. Baijia Commune, located in the mountainous area, has undulating mountains, crisscrossing valleys, sparse population, scattered fields, and very inconvenient transportation. The labor days occupied by field transportation in the entire commune are about 300,000, accounting for 32.5% of the total agricultural labor; the labor days for transporting fuel and feed for canteens and breeding farms are about 5,044, accounting for 0.5% of the total labor; the commune's incoming and outgoing grain, local and special products, building materials, pesticides, agricultural fertilizers, and daily necessities require about 66,000 labor days to be collected and transported to the roadside, accounting for 6.4% of the total labor.

Helin Commune, located in the hilly area, has slopes, terraces, some flat dams and high mountains. Except for three production teams that can partially use roads for transportation by vehicles, most of the commune relies on carrying on the back and shoulders, with short-distance transportation accounting for 47.35% of the labor days throughout the year.

Liaoyuan Commune, located in the plain area, has better natural conditions, with flat dams accounting for 70%, hills accounting for 25%, and mountains accounting for 5%. There are currently four highways, 9.6 kilometers long, eleven large cart roads, 9.8 kilometers long, and two dirt cart roads, 0.6 kilometers long. Except for the highways, the large cart roads and dirt cart roads have not been fully utilized due to their poor quality, and field transportation still mostly relies on carrying on the back and shoulders. The agricultural crops, economic crops, and commune-run industry output of this commune have grown more than those of the hilly and mountainous areas. Therefore, the collection and transportation of goods and field transportation account for 48.47% of the agricultural labor days.

Although these three communes have different natural conditions, the labor occupied by field transportation is quite large. Improving field transportation conditions can free up a large amount of labor and enrich the strength of field production.

In order to change the backward transportation situation in the fields and save a lot of labor, these three communes, based on the principle of adapting to local conditions, self-reliance, starting small and growing bigger, starting from low to high, first trunk lines and then branch lines, first key points and then general points, planned a field transportation road network. The principle of planning is to start from reality, exert its function as soon as possible, and avoid occupying too much land at the same time. In addition to mechanized farming areas, the field road network makes full use of the original foundation and existing conditions, building more large cart roads, frame cart roads, and wheelbarrow roads; adapting to the characteristics of large slopes and high altitudes in mountainous areas, building chutes and aerial ropeways; using water weirs and ditches to allow boats to pass through. Baijia Commune planned 80 large cart roads, frame cart roads, and wheelbarrow roads, 93 kilometers long, 50 aerial ropeways, 2,500 meters long, and manufactured 800 carts. Liaoyuan Commune is a key area for mechanized farming, and planned 6.75 kilometers of mechanized farming roads, 48 kilometers of large cart roads, 113 kilometers of dirt cart roads, manufactured 4,359 carts, and 7,750 meters of ropeways; after the plan is realized, there will be an average of 4.41 kilometers of various roads per square kilometer, 18.88 kilometers of cart roads per 100 people, and one cart per 15.6 people.

After these roads are built, a field short-distance transportation network connecting management areas, production teams, processing points, breeding farms, fields, drying grounds, factories and mines, and market towns will be formed, crisscrossing and extending in all directions. Using cart transportation instead of carrying on the back and shoulders, Baijia Commune can save 200,000 labor days throughout the year in transportation labor; Helin Commune will liberate 80% of the transportation labor from carrying on the back and shoulders, and transportation labor can be reduced from 47.35% of the total labor to 28.41%; Liaoyuan Commune can reduce transportation labor from 48.47% of the total labor to 19.38%, saving a total of 280,000 labor days. If all fields in the province realize cart transportation, the labor saved can be used to plant many more acres of land and increase grain production.

Field transportation is a component of agricultural production, and the road network must serve agriculture well according to the development of agriculture, and promote the development of the transportation industry to complete the ever-increasing transportation tasks. Based on the experience of Baijia, Helin, and Liaoyuan Communes in developing field transportation, the following measures should be taken:

First, strengthen leadership and make comprehensive arrangements. Since the task of road construction and cart manufacturing is large, and agricultural activities are very heavy, how can a field transportation network be established on the premise of ensuring high agricultural yields? First of all, the commune party committee must strengthen leadership, strengthen political and ideological work, widely publicize the great role of running field transportation well, and lay an ideological foundation for the development of field transportation. These three communes organized the masses to conduct repeated comparisons, calculating the accounts of saving labor and increasing agricultural production. The more the accounts were calculated, the clearer they became, and the masses actively supported it. On this basis, the commune made comprehensive arrangements for the labor force and labor time for running transportation in a big way, seizing every opportunity, in batches, and gradually realizing the plan. First, the roads connecting the management area to the commune, responsible for the transportation of large quantities of grain and means of production, were improved, and then the roads connecting warehouses, canteens, and fields, responsible for the transportation of fuel, fertilizers, and harvested materials into the warehouse, were improved, ensuring that production and road construction were not delayed.

Second, divide and contract sections, and complete them within a time limit. According to the road network plan, the roads connecting the production team to the canteen, warehouse, and fields, as well as the roads connecting to the management area, are built by the production team itself according to the time and standards stipulated by the commune. The roads between the management area and the commune and between the management areas are in principle the responsibility of the management area to organize the construction of the section within its territory. If a route crosses several management areas, the commune will make unified arrangements based on the length of the route, the difficulty of the project, and the amount of labor.

Third, in order to speed up the progress of the project, complete the construction tasks on time, with good quality, and in sufficient quantity without delaying agricultural activities, it is necessary to launch a mass movement in a big way. Helin Commune adopted the method of small repairs during busy periods and large repairs during less busy periods; Baijia Commune also mobilized cadres of organs and teachers and students of schools to participate in voluntary labor. At the same time, one section was repaired, and one section was opened to traffic, which promptly supported agricultural production.

Fourth, take materials locally and make comprehensive use of them. While repairing roads, it is necessary to vigorously build vehicles and vigorously promote advanced and high-quality vehicle types. Animal-powered vehicles, rail vehicles, chicken carts, wheelbarrows, etc., can be completely solved by taking materials locally and relying on self-reliance. Rural water conservancy construction has made great progress in recent years, and the comprehensive utilization of ditches, ponds, and weirs to allow wooden boats to navigate has also had good results.

    改善田间运输　节约劳动力
    四川省交通厅副厅长　丘先忠
    李富春同志在“高举总路线红旗继续前进”的文章中指出：“当前发展农业生产、增加粮食生产的主要关键，是从各方面节约劳动力，充实农业生产战线，首先是粮食生产战线。”从一切方面节约劳动力加强农业战线，具有重要的战略意义，也是迫切的政治任务。
    交通运输战线上，短途运输占用的劳动力最多。短途运输的重要组成部分——农村田间运输如何节约劳动力，应该引起足够的重视。田间运输在农业活动的大小环节都起着作用，从耕作、播种、施肥到收获，直至入仓、消费，环环不离运输。目前，农业机械化程度还比较低，许多地区田间运输仍沿用几千年来的人背肩挑的古老方式，占用了大量劳动力。
    最近，我们在梁平县柏家、和林和燎原三个公社调查了田间运输问题，摸索田间运输占用劳动力的情况和节约办法。
    这三个公社一个在山区，一个在丘陵，一个在平原。山区的柏家公社，山峦起伏，沟谷纵横，地广人稀，田地分散，交通很不便利。全社田间运输占用的劳动工日约为三十万个，占农业总劳动力的32.5％；食堂和饲养场的燃料，饲料运输工日约为五千零四十四个，占总劳动力的0.5％；社内调进调出的粮食、土特产品、建筑材料、农药、农肥和生活用品，集运到公路沿线，约需要六万六千工日，占总劳动力的6.4％。
    丘陵区的和林公社有坡地、梯田，有部分平坝和高山。全公社除三个区队可以部分利用公路，用车子运输外，绝大部分都靠人背肩挑，全年短途运输占劳动工日的47.35％。
    平原区的燎原公社，自然条件较好，平坝占70％，丘陵占25％，山地占5％，现有公路四条，九点六公里，大车路十一条，九点八公里，土车路二条，零点六公里。除公路外，大车路和土车路由于质量不高，没有充分发挥作用，田间运输仍多用人背肩挑。这个公社的农业作物、经济作物和社办工业的产量比丘陵、山区增长更大。因此，货物集运和田间运输占农业劳动工日的48.47％。
    这三个公社自然条件虽然不同，但是田间运输占用的劳动力都相当多。改善田间交通运输条件，就可以腾出大量劳动力，充实田间生产的力量。
    为了改变田间落后的交通运输面貌，大量节约劳动力，这三个公社本着因地制宜、自力更生、由小到大、由低到高、先干线后支线、先重点后一般的方针，规划了田间运输道路网。规划的原则是从现实出发，尽快发挥作用，同时避免过多地占用土地。田间道路网除机耕地区以外，都充分利用原来的基础和现有条件，多修大车路、架车路、独轮车路；适应山区坡度大、居高临下的特点，修建梭槽、架空索道；利用水堰沟渠，通行船只。柏家公社规划了大车路、架车路、独轮车路八十条，九十三公里，架空索道五十条，二千五百米，造车八百辆。燎原公社是机耕重点地区，规划了机耕路六点七五公里，大车路四十八公里，土车路一百一十三公里，造车四千三百五十九部，索道七千七百五十米；规划实现后，平均每平方公里将有各种道路四点四一公里，每一百人有车路十八点八八公里，每十五点六人有一辆车。
    这些道路建成以后，将形成通管理区、通生产队、通加工点、通饲养场、通田间、通晒坝、通厂矿、通场镇的田间短途运输网，纵横交错，四通八达。用车运代替人背肩挑，柏家公社运输劳动力全年可节约二十万工日；和林公社将有80％的运输劳动力从人背肩挑中解放出来，运输劳动力可由占总劳动力的47.35％下降为28.41％；燎原公社运输劳动力可由占总劳动力的48.47％下降到19.38％，共节约二十八万劳动工日。如果全省所有田间都实现运输车子化，所节约的劳动力，可以多种许多万亩田，增产许多粮食。
    田间运输是农业生产的组成部分，必须根据农业的发展，使道路网很好地服务于农业，并促进运输事业的发展，完成不断增长的运输任务。根据柏家、和林和燎原三个公社发展田间运输事业的经验，应当采取以下几项作法：
    第一，加强领导，全面安排。由于修路造车任务大，农事活动又十分繁重，如何在保证农业高产的前提下，建立田间运输网呢？首先，公社党委要加强领导，加强政治思想工作，广泛宣传办好田间运输的重大作用，为发展田间运输打下思想基础。这三个公社组织群众进行了反复对比，算节约劳力账和农业增产账，账愈算愈明，群众积极拥护。在这个基础上，公社对大办运输的劳动力、劳动时间作了全面安排，见缝插针，分期分批，逐步实现规划。先搞好管理区通公社的担负大宗粮食调运和生产资料运输的道路，然后搞通仓库、食堂和田间，担负燃料、肥料和收获物入仓等运输的道路，保证生产、修路两不误。
    第二，分段包干，限期完成。根据道路网规划，生产队通食堂、仓库和田间的道路，以及通管理区的道路，由生产队按照公社规定的时间和标准，自行修建。管理区通公社和管理区通管理区之间的道路，原则上由管理区负责组织修建本境内的路段。如果一条路线跨越几个管理区，则由公社根据路线长短，工程难易，劳力多寡，统一安排。
    第三，为了加快工程进展，按时、按质、按量完成修建任务不误农时，必须大搞群众运动。和林公社采取大忙小修，小忙大修等办法；柏家公社还发动机关干部和学校师生参加义务劳动。同时，修好一段，通车一段，及时支援了农业生产。
    第四，就地取材，综合利用。修路的同时，必须大抓造车，大量推广进步的、优良的车型。畜力车、轨道车、鸡公车、独轮车等，完全可以就地取材，自力更生解决。农村水利建设几年来有很大发展，综合利用沟渠塘堰，通航木船，效果也很好。
