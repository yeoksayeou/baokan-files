    Protesting Landowners' Infringement of Workers' Rights
    National Sugar Workers in Peru Strike
    Twenty-five thousand sugar workers across Peru launched a 24-hour strike on the 12th to protest the actions of the owner of the Pomalca sugar plantation on the northern coast of Peru, who used police forces to prevent the plantation's five thousand workers from organizing a union.
    The Pomalca plantation is the property of figures such as Julio de la Piedra, the head of the former military dictatorship.
    The National Federation of Sugar Workers of Peru announced that the plantation owner and the police force prevented agricultural workers of the Pomalca plantation from holding a general meeting on the 11th, and prohibited the leaders of the union organization from entering the plantation. The police force also attacked agricultural workers who participated in the founding assembly of the union organization on the 8th.
    Sugar workers in Lambayeque Province have already announced a general strike to support the struggle of the agricultural workers on the Pomalca plantation.
