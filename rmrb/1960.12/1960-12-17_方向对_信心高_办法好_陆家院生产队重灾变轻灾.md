Right Direction, High Confidence, Good Methods
Lu Jiayuan Production Team Transforms Severe Disaster into Mild Disaster
    Having overcome severe drought, rice was planted in time; after three consecutive days of torrential rain, two-thirds was flooded. Adhering to production and disaster relief, crash-planting winter wheat and winter vegetables, developing sideline production, and ensuring food and clothing for commune members.

    Five *li* south of Chengguan in Jinghai, Hebei, is the Lu Jiayuan Production Team. More than three months ago, most of the farmland here was a sea of water, and severe waterlogging brought great difficulties to people's production and life. However, under the leadership of the Party, the Party members, cadres, and commune members of this team united as one, worked hard, pooled their wisdom, and unswervingly took the road of production for disaster relief and frugality to overcome the famine. After more than three months of tenacious struggle, the entire team has changed from a severely affected area to a lightly affected area, and significant changes have taken place in production, life, and people's mental outlook. Now, commune members are guaranteed food and clothing, and can receive wages every month; the wheat seedlings are full and strong, and the winter vegetables are generally growing well. The commune members are all delighted, their enthusiasm for labor is high, and they are happily engaged in winter production activities such as accumulating fertilizer, managing wheat, and sideline production.

    Where there are difficulties, there are solutions.

    Lu Jiayuan is close to the right bank of the South Canal, and the terrain is low-lying, often subject to attacks by river water and waterlogging, and crop harvests are very unstable. This year, however, after experiencing continuous severe drought, after nearly 300 days of drought resistance, 1,765 *mu* of rice and 805 *mu* of field crops were planted in time, and the seedlings grew very well, with a good harvest in sight. At this time, it encountered a natural disaster beyond human power. In late August, there were three consecutive days of torrential rain, and most of the crops were flooded. After vigorous drainage and rescue, only 830 *mu* were saved, and two-thirds of the crops were flooded. In this situation, some cadres and commune members became depressed.

    The Party branch of this team studied the instructions of the higher-level Party committee, studied the past experience of leading production and overcoming famine, and decided to mobilize the masses to take the road of production for disaster relief. Afterwards, forums were held separately for experienced old farmers and poor and lower-middle peasants. At these meetings, the team's resources were first laid out: the team's remaining crops were expected to yield 50,000 to 60,000 *jin* of grain. From the beginning of June to the wheat harvest next year, it was estimated that 60,000 to 70,000 *jin* of grain would still be needed for the whole village for human consumption, animal feed, and seeds; and several thousand yuan would also be needed for autumn and spring planting investments. After revealing the team's resources, the question of "whether we can overcome the famine and how to overcome the famine" was launched for everyone to discuss. Old commune member Sun Wanfu said: "Before liberation, encountering such a disaster year was really a dead end, with no way to borrow or copy. Now, with the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we can overcome the famine." Poor and lower-middle peasant Han Fuchun continued: "After the establishment of the People's Commune, the strength to resist disasters is even greater. Take drainage as an example. In the past, when we had waterlogging here, it would take until the spring of the following year to dry out at the earliest. This year, the commune's pumping station drained water day and night, and the accumulated water visibly decreased, and we can definitely plant wheat on time." The commune members spoke one after another, and the favorable conditions for overcoming the famine became more and more numerous. Some said: "If the grain on the ground is lost, there is still a whole ditch of underground grain (referring to Chinese artichokes)"; others said: "If agriculture is lost, we can still engage in sideline production...". The more they discussed, the more energetic they became, which strengthened everyone's confidence in overcoming the disaster. People who originally had pessimistic emotions also cheered up.

    Everyone discusses, everyone works.

    With confidence in overcoming the disaster strengthened, the question of how to overcome the disaster was then discussed. Judging from the commune members' discussions, there were two main views on the road to overcome the famine at that time: a few people advocated simply relying on the state to supply grain; however, the majority of commune members advocated seizing the opportunity to salvage the remaining autumn crops, to collect everything that could be eaten and used, and to plant more autumn vegetables to minimize the amount of grain and materials requested from the state. When winter came, more labor would be extracted to engage in sideline production.

    The branch believed that this was not just a question of thinking, but a question of the direction of production for disaster relief. In order to unify thinking and clarify the direction, do it ourselves, and produce for disaster relief, the Party branch continued to mobilize the masses to discuss: Should we reach out to the state for grain, or should we grab more materials now to reduce the burden on the state? After discussion, the commune members realized that although we have suffered a disaster and cannot provide grain to support national construction, we should not increase the burden on the state too much, and we should try our best to overcome difficulties ourselves. After the truth was clarified, the commune members' ideological awareness was further improved, and it was proposed that grasping the opportunity to produce more agricultural products was the top priority, and engaging in sideline production on a large scale in winter. Once the direction was clarified, people immediately took action. After repeated replanting, more than 200 *mu* of autumn vegetables were finally planted, and the task of sowing 700 *mu* of wheat was completed in a timely manner. Then, after careful processing and management, the team harvested more than 200,000 *jin* of cabbage, turnips, and other vegetables, and the wheat seedlings also grew very well.

    After the masses were mobilized, there were more and more ways to overcome the famine. If the commune members had any good ideas, they would take the initiative to tell the cadres, and the team cadres also paid special attention to listening to the opinions of the masses and discussed things with the commune members. Commune member Sun Wanfu said to the production team leader: "In good years, people still pay attention to 'bending over in autumn is better than turning around three times in winter.' This year we have suffered a disaster, and we have to do this even more. We should collect everything that can be eaten and used." These opinions of the commune members coincided with the Party branch's plan. After the wheat planting was completed, the main labor force of each team was divided into three fronts: one part of the people carried out "small autumn harvest"; another part was responsible for planting more overwintering vegetables; and two teams each extracted eight strong laborers to engage in transportation at the railway station to increase cash income. As a result of this arrangement, 105 *mu* of overwintering vegetables were planted in a timely manner, an expansion of more than 80 *mu* compared to last year; engaging in transportation, nearly 4,000 yuan was earned in the last month alone.

    Take one step, look two steps.

    In the process of leading production for disaster relief, the Party branch also realized that agricultural production and many sideline productions have a certain seasonality, and it is necessary to take one step and prepare for the next. Early preparation and clever arrangements can take the initiative and promote quality with speed. The branch helped the teams arrange in advance what production tasks needed to be completed and what preparations needed to be made at each stage, and how many people were needed for each task. Before the autumn planting and autumn plowing were completed, the commune members were organized to discuss the winter production arrangements by team. In agriculture: do a good job in winter management and fertilizer accumulation for wheat, so that wheat can safely overwinter and ensure that there is fertilizer for planting next year; manage the overwintering vegetables well and store the autumn vegetables well; in sideline production: in addition to managing fish, transporting, and processing pulp, after the Heavy Snow solar term, two more types of production, making straw curtains and weaving mats, will be added. The commune members' household sideline production is arranged by the commune members themselves. According to the winter production tasks, the teams allocated work according to each commune member's technical expertise, achieving clever use of labor. The time for commune members to work in winter was strictly regulated to ensure a balance between work and rest.

    Taking one step and looking two steps keeps the entire team's work proactive. The tools needed for ice fishing were repaired before the ice froze, and after the ice froze, they immediately went down to the ditch to manage the fish. In order to ensure that the wheat safely overwinters, the commune members responsible for managing the wheat have already prepared more than 1,000 cartloads of fertilizer, and as soon as the Heavy Snow solar term arrives, they will be able to send it to the fields to "cover the wheat."

    Go deep down and grasp policies.

    The Party members and cadres of this team have actively participated in the struggle for production and disaster relief. Wherever there are difficulties or problems, there are Party members and cadres. When there are difficulties, the cadres and commune members overcome them together; when problems are encountered, everyone studies and solves them together.

    The cadres are on the front line of production, paying special attention to mobilizing the commune members' enthusiasm for production by implementing the Party's various policies. The Party branch originally planned to draw people from the teams for winter fishing, which would be managed uniformly by the production team. After discussing this opinion with the team cadres and commune members, many commune members raised different opinions. The reasons given were: one is that the winter fishing team of 36 people is not small in our village, but it is still the smallest compared to other teams in Jiakouwa. The ditch is deep and the area is large. It is not as good as other teams to fish in large areas, and more than 30 people will be idle if they fish in small areas. It is better to divide it into two shifts and organize it well by the team. The second is that the team can allocate labor, and more people can be added when there are more fish, and people can be freed up to do other things when there are fewer fish. The Party branch carefully considered these opinions of the teams and commune members and decided to change the fish management production to team management. In this way, the enthusiasm of the team cadres and commune members was mobilized, and as soon as the ice froze, the two fish management groups became active.

    Care for people, be considerate of people.

    After suffering from the flood, the Party branch made it the top priority of production and disaster relief to improve the lives of the commune members.

    First of all, in the spirit of planned grain use, economical grain use, eating more during busy farming seasons, and eating less during slack farming seasons, the masses were mobilized to discuss the grain use plan. According to the opinions of the commune members and the team's production tasks in different seasons, the period from the beginning of September to June next year was divided into four segments, and the grain consumption targets were determined by segment, and the policy of "quantifying grain according to people, grain to the hall, eating on tickets, and saving for oneself" was conscientiously implemented, and the grain management system was further improved.

    Recently, Liu Shaorong, the secretary of the Party branch, and Liu Junming, the commune's resident cadre, went to the canteen to serve as managers and studied with the cooks to improve the lives of the commune members. In order to solve the problem of winter heating for the commune members, the team distributed firewood to each household and individual on the one hand; on the other hand, it stipulated a certain amount of time for the commune members to pick up firewood themselves. On the morning of November 23, when it was snowing heavily, the branch secretary, the production team leader, the commune's resident cadre, and the team leader visited each household separately to check the preparations for winter. During the inspection, it was found that the windows of commune member Zang Guangrui's house had not been papered up yet, and the children's cotton pants were too thin, so the cadres immediately helped solve the problem.

    方向对　信心高　办法好
    陆家院生产队重灾变轻灾
    战胜严重干旱，适时种上水稻；连续三天暴雨，又被淹掉三分之二坚持生产救灾，抢种冬麦冬菜，开展副业生产，保证社员吃穿
    从河北静海城关向南走五华里，有个陆家院生产队。三个多月以前，这里大部分农田还是一片汪洋，严重的沥水灾害给人们的生产、生活带来了很大困难。然而，这个队的党员、干部和社员们，在党的领导下，团结一致，发愤图强，群策群力，坚定不移地走生产救灾、节约度荒的道路。经过三个多月的顽强斗争，全队就由重灾变为轻灾，生产、生活和人们的精神面貌，都发生了显著的变化。现在，社员吃、穿都有保证，月月还能领工资；小麦块块苗全苗壮，冬菜普遍生长良好。社员们个个欢欣鼓舞，劳动热情高涨，心情愉快地投入了积肥、小麦管理、副业生产等冬季生产活动。
    有困难，有办法
    陆家院紧靠南运河右岸，地势低洼，常受河水、沥水的袭击，农作物收成很不稳定。但是连续遇到大旱，经过近三百天的抗旱斗争，适时种上了一千七百六十五亩水稻和八百零五亩大田，禾苗长的很出色，丰收在望。就在这个时候，遇上了人力不可抗拒的自然灾害。8月下旬连降三天暴雨，绝大部分庄稼被淹没了，经过大力排水抢救，全队只救出了八百三十亩，三分之二的农作物被淹。在这种情况下，有的干部、社员情绪低落下来。
    这个队的党支部学习了上级党委的指示，研究了过去领导生产度荒的经验，确定发动群众，走生产救灾的道路。而后分别召开了有度荒经验的老农座谈会和贫农社员座谈会。在这些会上，先摆出了全队的家底：全队剩下的庄稼，预计能打五、六万斤粮，从6月初到明年麦收，全村人吃、马喂和籽种估计还缺六、七万斤粮食；秋种和春种投资也得几千元。亮出家底以后，就“能不能度过灾荒，怎样度过灾荒”的问题，发动大家进行讨论。老社员孙万福说：“解放前碰上这样的灾年，真是走头无路，借抄无门。现在有共产党和毛主席的领导，我们就能够度过灾荒。”贫农社员韩富春接着说：“成立人民公社以后，抗灾的力量更大了。就拿排水来说吧，往年咱们这里下涝了，最早也得第二年春天才能脱干。今年，咱们公社的扬水站黑夜白日的排水，积水眼看着往下脱，准能按时种上麦子。”社员们你一言，我一语，度荒的有利条件越摆越多。有的说：“地上的粮食丢了，还有满洼的地下粮（指地梨）”；还有的说：“农业丢了，我们还能搞副业……”。越讨论，越有劲，使大家坚定了战胜灾荒的信心，原来存有悲观情绪的人，也鼓起了干劲。
    大家议，大家干
    战胜灾荒的信心坚定了，接着讨论了如何战胜灾荒的问题。从社员讨论的情况看，当时对度荒的道路有两种主张：少数人主张单纯依赖国家供应粮食；可是，多数社员主张抓紧时机，打涝残秋，把一切能吃能用的东西都收上来，还要多多抢种秋菜，尽量少向国家要粮要物，等进入冬季再抽出较多的力量，搞副业生产。
    支部认为：这不只是一个思想问题，而是生产度荒的方向问题。为了统一思想，明确方向，自己动手，生产救灾，党支部继续发动群众讨论：咱们是伸手向国家要粮食呢？还是现在多抓物，减轻国家负担呢？经过讨论，社员们认识到：我们虽然受了灾，不能拿出粮食支援国家建设了，可是也不应该给国家增加太多的负担，要尽量自己想法克服困难。道理辩明了，社员的思想觉悟进一步提高了，提出要抓紧时机，多搞农产品，是当务之急，冬季再大搞副业。方向一经明确，人们立刻行动起来了。经过反复补种，终于种上了二百多亩秋菜，还适时完成了七百亩小麦的播种任务。接着，又加工细管，全队共收了白菜、萝卜等二十多万斤，麦苗也长得很好。
    群众被发动起来以后，度荒的办法越来越多，社员有什么好主意，都主动找干部去说，队干部也特别注意倾听群众的意见，有事和社员共同商量。社员孙万福对生产队长说：“好年头的时候，人们还讲究‘秋天弯弯腰，胜过冬天转三遭’。今年受了灾，更得这样办，应该把能吃能用的东西都收回来。”社员们的这些意见，和党支部的打算碰在一块了。种麦结束以后，各小队就把主要劳力划分了三条战线：一部分人进行“小秋收”；另一部分人负责多种越冬菜；两个小队各抽出八个壮劳力到火车站搞搬运，增加现金收入。这样安排的结果，适时种上了一百零五亩越冬菜，比去年扩大八十多亩；搞搬运，最近一个月就收入近四千元。
    走一步，看两步
    党支部在领导生产度荒的过程中，还认识到：农业生产和许多副业生产都有一定的季节性，必须走上步，准备下一步。早做准备，安排得巧，才能争取主动，以早促好。支部对每个阶段需要完成那些生产任务和作好那些准备工作，各项任务需要多少人去做，都是事先帮助小队安排好。在秋种、秋耕还没有完成的时候，就以小队为单位组织社员讨论了冬季生产的安排问题。在农业方面：搞好小麦越冬管理和积肥，让小麦安全过冬，保证明年种地有肥料；把越冬菜管理好，把秋菜保管好；在副业生产上：除了治鱼、搬运、加工纸浆以外，大雪节令以后，再增加打草帘和织席两种生产，社员的家庭副业由社员个人安排。各小队根据冬季的生产任务，按照每个社员的技术专长，进行量人派活，做到了巧用劳动力。对冬季社员劳动的时间，作了严格规定，保证有劳有逸。
    走一步，看两步，使全队的工作步步主动。冰上治鱼所需要的工具，在没有结冰前就修理好了，结冰后立即下洼治鱼。为了保证小麦安全过冬，负责管理小麦的社员，已经整好了一千多车肥料，进入大雪节令，马上就能送到田间，给小麦“盖被”。
    深入下去抓政策
    这个队的党员、干部都积极投入了生产救灾斗争，哪里有困难、有问题，哪里就有党员、干部。有困难，干部和社员共同克服；碰到问题，大家共同研究解决。
    干部在生产第一线，特别注意通过贯彻执行党的各项政策，调动社员的生产积极性。党支部原计划冬网治鱼从小队抽人，由生产队统一经营。这个意见和小队干部、社员商量以后，许多社员提出了不同的意见。人们的理由，一个是：三十六个人的冬网班，在本村说来不算小，可是和贾口洼别的队比起来还是最小的，洼里水深面大，打大片比不过人家别的队，打小片三十多人又窝工，不如分成两班，由小队组织好。第二是由小队支配劳力，鱼多的时候可以多加人，鱼少的时候，可以腾出人来干别的。党支部认真考虑了小队和社员的这些意见，确定把治鱼生产改为小队经营。这样，调动了小队干部和社员的积极性，刚刚结冰，两个治鱼组就活动起来了。
    关心人，体贴人
    遭受水灾以后，党支部就把搞好社员生活作为生产度荒头等重要的任务。
    首先本着计划用粮、节约用粮，农忙多吃、农闲少吃的精神，发动群众讨论了用粮计划。根据社员的意见和本队不同季节的生产任务，从9月初到明年6月分为四段，按段确定了吃粮指标，并认真执行了“以人定量，粮食到堂，凭票吃饭，节约归己”的政策，进一步健全了粮食管理制度。
    最近，党支部书记刘少荣和公社驻队干部刘俊明到食堂担任管理员，和炊事员们共同研究改善社员的生活。为解决社员冬季取暖问题，队里一方面按户按人分配了烧柴；另一方面，规定一定时间让社员自己拾柴。11月23日清晨，天下着鹅毛大雪，支部书记、生产队长、公社驻队干部和小队长，就分头挨门访问，检查过冬准备工作。检查中发现社员臧广瑞家的窗户还没有糊好，孩子的棉裤太薄，干部们就马上帮助解决问题。
