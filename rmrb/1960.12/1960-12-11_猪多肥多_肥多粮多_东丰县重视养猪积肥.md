Dongfeng County emphasizes pig raising for manure accumulation

(Our dispatch) Dongfeng County, Jilin Province, at all levels of Party committees, pay attention to pig raising and manure accumulation. Currently, the county has more than 95,700 pigs, an increase of 121.3% over last year. Pig manure accounts for 40% of the total fertilizer applied. This year, despite suffering from severe water and insect disasters, grain production still achieved a bumper harvest, close to last year's output. Because of the vast land and sparse population in this county, there used to be an old habit of fertilizing only once every three years. After the establishment of the people's communes, this old habit has been greatly changed, but it has not been fundamentally overcome. In response to this situation, the Dongfeng County Party Committee widely publicized the mutually promoting relationship between more pigs, more manure, and more grain throughout the county, from within the Party to outside the Party, from cadres to commune members. During the propaganda, they specifically calculated the increase in grain production after increasing pig manure, and organized cadres and commune members to visit units with more pigs, more manure, and more grain. The Dongxing Management Area of Huangnihe Commune reached one pig per person, and the application of fertilizer per hectare increased from 14,000 catties last year to 30,000 catties (mostly pig manure). As a result, the average yield per unit area increased by about 50% compared to the previous year. They used this fact to educate the people of the county. Many communes also conducted propaganda and education using comparative methods. The Sixth Production Team and the Fifth Production Team of the Dongyang Management Area of Daxi Commune had basically the same production conditions and number of pigs. The Sixth Team paid attention to raising pigs and accumulating manure, and last year's total grain output increased by 91%; the Fifth Team did not pay enough attention to raising pigs and accumulating manure, and the total grain output increased by only 18%. Through this comparison, everyone further realized the great role of raising pigs and accumulating manure. After this propaganda and education campaign throughout the county, the commune members and cadres improved their understanding of raising pigs and accumulating manure, and most of the cadres and commune members realized the correct relationship between raising pigs, accumulating manure, and increasing grain production.

In order to deepen the education on pig raising and manure accumulation and solve specific problems in manure accumulation, the leading cadres of Party committees at all levels went deep into the front line of production and planted 622 "experimental fields" for pig raising and manure accumulation. From planting the experimental fields, they found and timely summarized the experience of pig raising and manure accumulation. Ma Jian, the first secretary of the County Party Committee, and Liu Wanlu, the secretary, summarized four experiences in the "experimental field" of Houshi People's Commune, addressing the new problems that arose after the change in pig raising methods: rational distribution of pig pens, appropriately changing small pens into large pens (to facilitate manure accumulation), accumulating manure all year round, and determining fertilizer based on the number of pigs. After these experiences were promoted throughout the county, the work of pig raising and manure accumulation was further developed. From the County Party Committee to the production team, a livestock front led by pigs was established at all levels, strengthening the specific leadership of pig raising and manure accumulation.

The county has explored some characteristics of pig raising and manure accumulation from practice, and the county has taken specific measures in response to these characteristics. The main measures are: "One Grasp," "Double Reform," "Two Combinations," and "Three Diligences."

"One Grasp" is to focus on pig raising in production teams and canteens. The County Party Committee analyzed the county's characteristics: it is located in a semi-mountainous area, pastures are scattered, the residence is not concentrated, and the operating conditions are poor. In order to adapt to this characteristic and facilitate manure accumulation and transportation, Party committees at all levels strengthened the leadership of pig raising in production teams and canteens, corrected the idea of ​​some cadres who one-sidedly emphasized the establishment of pig farms by communes and districts, pursuing largeness and completeness, adhered to the principle of small-scale as the main, medium-sized as auxiliary, and a combination of medium and small-sized, and made appropriate plans and adjustments to the scale and layout of commune and district pig farms. The county has been adjusted from 800 pig farms last year to 1,576 pig farms, including 166 pig farms run by state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms, government agencies, industrial and mining enterprises, schools, and other units; 195 run by communes and management areas; and the remaining 1,215 are run by production teams and public canteens. In addition, large-scale pig farms operated by communes and management areas also adopted methods such as multiple locations in one farm, decentralized operation, and placing them in production teams for breeding, so that every team has a pig farm and every place has a manure accumulation base. These measures have effectively promoted pig raising in production teams, canteens, and commune members, creating conditions for accumulating more pig manure.

"Double Reform" is to reform manure accumulation methods and reform the seasonality of manure accumulation. Reforming manure accumulation methods is based on the fact that pig pens were insufficient in the past, and small pens were not conducive to manure accumulation, advocating building more pens and larger pens. Various places have generally built larger pig pens using soil instead of wood or a combination of soil and wood. According to incomplete statistics, the county has added 3,074 pig pens. Reforming the seasonality of manure accumulation is based on the difficulty of accumulating manure in the five months of severe winter, mobilizing the masses to offer suggestions and advice to do a good job in winter manure accumulation. The methods adopted in various places include: digging underground insulated pig pens, padding soil or straw ash at any time, and mixing urine ice with soil at any time, which basically changed the habit of less manure accumulation in winter.

"Two Combinations" are the combination of collective manure accumulation and commune member family manure accumulation, and the combination of village manure accumulation and field-side manure accumulation. In terms of collective manure accumulation, the county promoted the experience of Nadang Commune in determining fertilizer based on the number of pigs and rewarding excess. Make sure that every farm has a fertilizer pit, every pen has a waterway, manure is not lost, and the environment is clean. When promoting this experience, Wudaogang Commune also established a responsibility system combining feeders, herdsmen, and manure accumulators. Feeders and herdsmen are responsible for pen manure. Manure accumulators are responsible for special vehicles, special animal manure transportation, and pulling soil for bedding. For commune member family manure accumulation, the production team pulls soil, and the price is calculated based on the amount of fertilizer after manure accumulation, and reasonable remuneration is paid, which encourages commune members to accumulate manure. A combination of village manure accumulation and field-side manure accumulation. In the summer, all communes generally implement pig pens leaving the village and accumulating manure on the side of the field. This year, Erlongshan Commune built 78 pig pens on the side of the field, realizing a "one-stop" service for pig raising, manure accumulation, manure transportation, and planting feed.

"Three Diligences" are diligent in cleaning, padding, and sweeping pig pens. Throughout the county, regardless of public or private pig pens, the "three diligences" system has been implemented. (Attached picture)

    猪多肥多　肥多粮多
    东丰县重视养猪积肥
    本报讯　吉林省东丰县各级党委重视养猪积肥。目前全县养猪头数为九万五千七百多头，比去年增长121.3％，猪肥已占总施肥量的40％。今年粮食产量在遭受严重的水、虫等灾害的情况下，仍然获得丰收，接近去年的产量。这个县由于地多人少，过去有三年施一次肥的旧习惯。人民公社化后，这种旧习惯虽然有很大改变，但并没有根本克服。中共东丰县委针对这种情况，在全县从党内到党外，从干部到社员，广泛宣传了猪多、肥多、粮食多的互相促进的道理。在宣传中，具体计算增加猪肥后的粮食增产账，组织干部和社员到猪多肥多粮食多的单位参观。黄泥河公社东兴管理区达到每人一头猪，去年每公顷地施肥由一万四千斤增加到三万斤（大部分是猪肥），结果平均单位面积产量比前年增长50％左右。他们用这个事实教育了全县人民。许多公社还用对比的方法进行了宣传教育。大兴公社东阳管理区第六生产队和第五生产队，生产条件和养猪头数基本相同，第六队注意了养猪积肥，去年粮食总产量增长91％；第五队对养猪积肥重视不够，粮食总产量仅增长18％。通过这一对比，使大家进一步认识到养猪积肥的巨大作用。全县经过这次宣传教育运动，提高了社员和干部对养猪积肥的认识，使绝大部分干部和社员认识到养猪、积肥、增产粮食三者的正确关系。
    为了把养猪积肥的教育深入一步，并解决积肥中的具体问题，全县各级党委领导干部又深入生产第一线，种了六百二十二处养猪积肥的“试验田”，从种试验田中找到并及时总结了养猪积肥的经验。县委第一书记马鉴，书记刘万禄在猴石人民公社种“试验田”中，针对养猪方式改变后出现的新问题，总结出了猪圈合理分布、小圈适当的改成大圈（便于积肥）、常年积肥、以猪定肥等四项经验。这些经验在全县推广后，使养猪积肥工作进一步开展起来。从县委到生产队，层层建立了以猪为首的畜牧业战线，加强了对养猪积肥的具体领导。
    全县从实践中摸索出一些养猪积肥的特点，并针对这些特点该县采取了具体措施。主要是：“一抓”、“双革”、“二结合”、“三勤”。
    “一抓”，是狠抓生产队和食堂养猪。县委分析本县的特点是：处于半山区，牧场零星分散，居住不集中，经营条件较差。为适应这一特点和便于积肥、运肥，各级党委加强了对生产队和食堂养猪的领导，纠正了某些干部片面地强调社、区办养猪场、贪大求全的思想，坚持以小型为主、中型为辅、中小型相结合的方针，并对社、区猪场的规模、布局作了适当规划与调整。全县由去年的八百个猪场，调整为一千五百七十六个，其中国营农牧场、机关、工矿企业、学校等单位办的猪场一百六十六个。公社、管理区办的一百九十五个。其余一千二百十五个，都是生产队和公共食堂办的。此外，公社、管理区经营的大型猪场，还采取一场多处、分散经营，放到生产队饲养等办法，做到队队有养猪场，处处有积肥基地。这些措施有力地促进了生产队、食堂和社员养猪，为多积猪肥创造了条件。
    “双革”，是改革积肥方法，改革积肥的季节性。改革积肥方法，是根据过去猪圈不足，圈小不便于积肥等情况，提倡多建圈，建较大的圈。各地普遍以土代木，土木结合的方法修建了较大的猪圈。据不完全统计，全县已增建猪圈三千零七十四间。改革积肥季节性，是根据在严冬的五个月积肥比较困难的情况，发动群众献策献计搞好冬季积肥。各地采取的方法有：挖地下保温猪圈，随时垫土或垫草灰、随时起尿冰拌土等，基本改变了冬季积肥少的习惯。
    “二结合”，是集体积肥和社员家庭积肥结合，村屯积肥与田边积肥结合。在集体积肥方面，全县推广了那丹公社以猪定肥、超额奖励的经验。做到场场有肥坑，圈圈有水道，粪肥不流失，环境卫生好。五道岗公社在推广这项经验时还建立了饲养员、放牧员、积肥员相结合的责任制度。饲养员、放牧员负责起圈肥。积肥员负责专车、专畜运肥和拉垫圈土。社员家庭积肥由生产队给拉土，积肥后以肥计价，合理付酬，鼓励了社员积肥的积极性。村屯积肥和田边积肥结合。各公社夏季普遍实行猪圈出村，田边积肥。二龙山公社今年在田边建猪圈七十八个，实现养猪、积肥、运肥、种饲料“一条龙”。
    “三勤”，是猪圈勤起、勤垫、勤打扫。全县不论公、私猪圈，都实行了“三勤”制度。（附图片）
