On the Consistency of Tasks with Policies and Work Style
Zhai Xiangdong

I have heard some comrades say: "Sometimes there is a conflict between completing tasks and implementing policies. To complete tasks, one cannot implement policies, and to implement policies, it is difficult to complete tasks."

I have also heard some comrades say: "It is good to be able to complete tasks. Working methods are endless. Always emphasizing work style and methods sometimes makes it difficult to complete tasks."

What is the relationship between completing tasks and implementing policies, paying attention to work style, and working methods? This is an important issue that must be clarified.

We work every day, and no matter what the nature of the work is, we are completing certain tasks. Resolutely and conscientiously completing the work tasks assigned by the Party is the basic requirement for every cadre and Party member. It is difficult to imagine that a comrade is good but always fails to complete tasks. Therefore, every cadre should regard completing tasks as a glorious responsibility and obligation and try every possible means to complete them. Except in individual cases where the tasks determined are not appropriate and need to be revised or need to be submitted to the higher authorities for revision, it is not allowed to fail to complete tasks without reason.

What does completing a task mean? To put it simply, it means what to do and what requirements to meet within a certain period of time. The products of industrial and agricultural production can be clearly calculated according to quantity and quality, but the quantity and quality of many tasks are not as easy to calculate as products. Because the completion of many work tasks also needs to be observed from the overall practical effect and must be measured by the Party's policies as a standard. That is to say, the completion of the task is the result of correctly implementing the Party's policies and adopting correct working methods. If we deviate from the Party's policies and only one-sidedly emphasize completing tasks, there will definitely be no good results, and the more quantity, the greater the harm. We often say that the purely task-oriented viewpoint is wrong because this viewpoint only pays attention to the requirements of time and quantity without considering the implementation of the Party's policies. The Party's various policies are all for the purpose of completing certain tasks. Conscientiously implementing policies can correctly handle various relationships, fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, and smoothly complete tasks. If we do not implement policies, it is impossible to truly complete any task. Therefore, it is said that implementing the Party's policies is the guarantee for completing tasks and the standard for checking how well the tasks are completed. And the ideological style and working methods of cadres and Party members are the key to the good or bad implementation of policies. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "With the correct line and policies, problems will still occur if work methods are neglected."
(《Work Methods of Party Committees》) This tells us that in implementing policies, we must adopt correct styles and methods, and not incorrect styles and methods. If the Party's policies are not correctly implemented, there is no point in talking about good style and good methods; similarly, if good methods are not adopted and there is no correct style, it is impossible to correctly implement the Party's policies. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Without solving the problem of methods, the task is just empty talk. ... If all work only puts forward tasks without paying attention to working methods in implementation, without opposing bureaucratic working methods but adopting practical and concrete working methods, without abandoning commandist working methods but adopting patient and persuasive working methods, then no task can be accomplished." (《Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Working Methods》)

Comrade Mao Zedong once instructed at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party that our cadre policy is based on "resolutely implementing the Party's line, obeying the Party's discipline, having close ties with the masses, having independent working ability, being active and willing to work, and not seeking personal gain as the standard." The Party has always used Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction as the standard for examining and using cadres. And for many years, it has educated cadres according to this standard. Under the Party's cultivation and education, the broad masses of cadres have reached this standard or are working towards this standard, so their work is getting better and better, and they have achieved great results. However, some comrades do not fully understand the Party's standards for examining and using cadres. This is often reflected in their improper handling of the relationship between tasks, policies, and work style in their actual work. If we analyze it carefully, we will find three situations:

First, being infinitely loyal to the Party, highly responsible to the masses, being able to carry forward the work style of seeking truth from facts and the mass line, resolutely and correctly implementing the Party's policies, and completing various work tasks well. That is to say, being able to complete tasks, and the completion of tasks is completely in line with the Party's policies, and is completed by adopting good working styles and methods.

Second, lacking the consciousness of conscientiously implementing the Party's policies, not taking the mass line sufficiently in work style, and lacking the spirit of seeking truth from facts, so some of the work tasks assigned by the Party are not completed well enough.

Third, failing to implement the Party's policies, failing to pay attention to the mass line and seeking truth from facts, so failing to complete tasks; or sometimes it seems from the surface that the task requirements have been met, but because the Party's policies have not been implemented and bad working styles have been adopted, the final result proves that the task has not been truly completed, and even good things have been ruined.

Obviously, the first situation is what the Party requires every cadre to do. Only by doing so can it conform to the interests of the Party and the people, can it be truly responsible to the Party and the people, and can it be the political demeanor that a proletarian revolutionary should have. The second situation is still far from the Party's requirements. If some shortcomings existing in the work are not quickly and resolutely overcome, it will be detrimental to the Party's cause. Therefore, the Party requires such comrades to make practical efforts to become outstanding cadres like those in front. The third situation is what the Party has always opposed. Because if the Party's policies are not implemented, things are not discussed with the masses, and facts are not sought from facts, it will inevitably seriously separate from the masses and cause bad consequences. It can be seen that using the unity of policies, tasks, and work style as an important standard to examine cadres can understand the cadres' ideological level and policy level, understand whether the cadres are closely connected with the masses and serve the masses well, and can also ensure the correct implementation of the Party's policies and ensure the continuous development of the revolutionary and construction undertakings.

In order to help cadres complete tasks according to the Party's requirements, higher-level Party organizations should pay great attention to strengthening the policy education and the education on work style and working methods for cadres, so that every cadre truly understands the extreme importance of resolutely implementing the Party's policies, effectively enhances the concept of policy, and strictly handles affairs in accordance with policies. At the same time, every cadre must truly understand the extreme importance of establishing a good work style and working methods, and must implement policies and complete tasks by carrying forward a good work style. This is a very important task.

Giving policies and giving work style at the same time as assigning tasks is a practical and effective method to improve the level of cadres. Cadres enhance their policy awareness, understand the necessity of carrying forward the correct style, and understand what policies to implement in each work and how to specifically use the working methods of the mass line in order to complete specific tasks well. The so-called assigning tasks is to tell cadres what to do in a certain period of time, what requirements to meet, and to make cadres understand why to do this thing, and understand the favorable conditions and possible difficulties. This will enhance the cadres' awareness of completing tasks. Since the actual situation is different, when assigning tasks, be sure not to be too rigid or too hasty, so that the lower levels can carry out work according to the specific situation. The so-called giving policies is to tell cadres what policies must be implemented when carrying out a certain work, why such policies must be implemented, and draw a clear line of policy. The deeper and more thorough the explanation of policies, the better the cadres understand the spirit of the policies, and the better they can complete the tasks. We must not only oppose giving tasks without giving policies, but also oppose the sloppy attitude when explaining policies. The so-called giving work style is to tell cadres how to discuss well with the masses when implementing policies, listen to the opinions of the masses, and implement policies according to the specific situation, and play an exemplary role in implementing policies.

In the process of implementing policies and completing tasks, in addition to specifically helping cadres from the above three aspects and summarizing and promoting their good experiences at any time, the higher-level leading organs and leading cadres must also check how well they have done in these three aspects, promptly discover shortcomings and deviations, and guide them to correct them. And they should strictly check whether they have implemented the policies and what methods they have adopted to complete the tasks when they finally complete the tasks. If they only "give three things" when deploying work, and do not provide specific assistance in the process of completing tasks, and do not check and discover problems and solve them at any time, then they cannot guarantee the smooth completion of work tasks, and may even tolerate the occurrence and development of errors.

Every cadre should comprehensively understand and accept the tasks, policies, and work style explained by the higher authorities, and should conscientiously handle affairs according to the explanation of the higher authorities, and unreservedly implement the Party's policies into their work. Neither double-dealing, taking out of context, nor being careless is allowed. Of course, this does not mean that one cannot proceed from reality. On the contrary, the Party has always taught us that we must correctly combine the Party's policies and instructions with the specific conditions of the local area. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "All correct tasks, policies, and work styles are in line with the requirements of the masses at that time and place, and are linked to the masses; all incorrect tasks, policies, and work styles are not in line with the requirements of the masses at that time and place, and are separated from the masses."
(《On Coalition Government》) We should keep in mind this instruction of Comrade Mao Zedong. If the actual situation has been truly and carefully studied, and it is felt that a certain task and a certain requirement put forward by the higher authorities is difficult to achieve, then one should reflect one's opinions and request the higher authorities to consider it. Doing so is a manifestation of being responsible to the Party and the masses.

Seeking truth from facts is inseparable from the mass line. The central link of adhering to the mass line is to consult with the masses in everything. As long as the tasks and policies are handed over to the masses, fully mobilizing the masses to discuss, listening to the voices of the masses, and adopting the correct opinions of the masses, not only can the wisdom of the masses be concentrated, but also the Party's policies can be implemented and various tasks can be completed under the supervision of the masses. If one talks about seeking truth from facts in words, but lacks a mass viewpoint, lacks a democratic spirit, and does not respect the opinions of the masses, and acts arbitrarily, there will be no mistakes.

In short, every cadre should have a task viewpoint, and even more should have a policy viewpoint, and should pay attention to work style and working methods, and should truly reflect the unity and consistency of these three in their work. Whether a cadre's work is good or bad should be used as a standard for inspection and measurement. As long as you consciously do this regularly, you will be able to gradually improve your policy level, improve your work style, and cultivate yourself into an excellent cadre, and outstandingly complete the various tasks assigned by the Party and the masses.

    谈任务同政策、作风的一致性
    翟向东
    曾经听到有的同志讲：“有时候完成任务与贯彻政策有矛盾，要完成任务，就不能贯彻政策，要贯彻政策，就不好完成任务。”
    也曾经听到有的同志讲：“能完成任务就好，工作方法无尽无休，总讲求作风和方法，有时候倒难完成任务。”
    究竟完成任务同贯彻执行政策、讲求工作作风、工作方法之间是个什么关系？这是必须弄清楚的一个重要问题。
    我们天天在工作，无论工作的性质是什么，都是在完成一定的任务。坚决认真地完成党所交付的工作任务，是每个干部和党员的起码条件。很难设想，一个同志很好，却总是完不成任务。因此，每个干部都应该把完成任务看作是光荣的责任和义务，千方百计地去完成。除了个别时候确定的任务不尽妥当，需要修改或需要经过请示上级修改以外，无故不完成任务是不允许的。
    完成任务是指什么呢？简单一点说，就是在一定的时间内，要做些什么，达到什么要求。工农业生产的产品，是可以明显地按数量、质量计算的，但是，许多工作的数量和质量，就不像产品那样好算。因为许多工作任务的完成，还需要从全面的实际效果来观察，还必须以党的政策作标准来衡量。也就是说，任务的完成是正确地贯彻执行了党的政策又采取了正确的工作方法的结果。如果离开了党的政策，只片面地强调完成任务，那一定不会有好结果，而且数量越多，坏处会越大。我们常说单纯任务观点不对，就是因为这种观点只注意时间和数量方面的要求，而不考虑贯彻党的政策。党的各项政策，都是为了完成一定任务的。认真贯彻执行政策，就可以正确处理各种关系，充分调动起群众的积极性，顺利地完成任务。如果不贯彻执行政策，那是根本无法真正完成任何任务的。因此说，贯彻执行党的政策是完成任务的保证，又是检查任务完成得怎样的标准。而干部、党员的思想作风、工作方法如何，则是政策贯彻执行得好坏的关键。毛泽东同志说：“有了正确的方针政策，如果在工作方法上疏忽了，还是要发生问题。”
    （《党委会的工作方法》）这告诉我们，在贯彻执行政策的时候，必须采取正确的作风和方法，不能采取错误的作风和方法。如果不正确地执行党的政策，就谈不上作风好和方法好；同样，如果不采取良好的方法，没有正确的作风，就不可能正确地贯彻执行党的政策。正如毛泽东同志所说：“不解决方法问题，任务也只是瞎说一顿。……一切工作，如果仅仅提出任务而不注意实行时候的工作方法，不反对官僚主义的工作方法而采取实际的具体的工作方法，不抛弃命令主义的工作方法而采取耐心说服的工作方法，那末，什么任务也是不能实现的。”（《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》）
    毛泽东同志在党的六届六中全会上曾经指示说，我们的干部政策是以“坚决地执行党的路线，服从党的纪律，和群众有密切的联系，有独立的工作能力，积极肯干，不谋私利为标准”。党考察和使用干部，一直是以毛泽东同志这一指示作为标准。并且多年来就是以这样的标准教育干部的。广大干部在党的培养教育下，达到了这个标准或正向这个标准努力，因而他们的工作越来越作得好，取得了巨大的成绩。然而，有些同志对党考察和使用干部的标准，还理解得不全面。这常常表现在他们对任务、政策、作风的关系，在实际工作中处理的不妥当。如果仔细加以分析的话，我们会发现这样三种情况：
    第一是，对党无限忠诚，对群众十分负责，能够发扬实事求是、群众路线的工作作风，坚决地正确地贯彻执行党的政策，很好地完成各项工作任务。也就是说，能够完成任务，而任务的完成又是完全符合党的政策的，并且是采取了良好的工作作风和工作方法完成的。
    第二是，比较缺乏认真贯彻执行党的政策的自觉性，在工作作风上走群众路线不够，实事求是的精神也不足，因此对党交给的一些工作任务，完成得还不够好。
    第三是，不贯彻执行党的政策，不讲求群众路线、实事求是，因而不能完成任务；或者有时候从表面上看来似乎达到了任务要求，然而因为没有贯彻执行党的政策，采取了不好的工作作风，最后的结果证明，实际上没有真正完成任务，甚至把好事情办坏。
    这三种情况，显然第一种情况是党要求每一个干部都应当做到的。只有这样去作，才符合党和人民的利益，才是真正对党和对人民负责，才是一个无产阶级革命家应有的政治风度。第二种情况，与党的要求还有距离，如果不迅速地坚决地克服工作中存在的某些缺点，对党的事业将是不利的。所以，党要求这样的同志能够切实地努力，像前边那些同志一样，成为优秀的干部。第三种情况，是党从来所反对的。因为如果不执行党的政策，办事不与群众商量，不实事求是，必然会严重脱离群众，造成恶果。可见，以政策、任务、作风这三方面的统一作为重要标准来考察干部，就能够了解干部的思想水平、政策水平如何，了解干部是否密切联系群众、很好地为群众服务，也就能够保证党的政策的正确执行，保证革命和建设事业的不断发展。
    为了帮助干部按党的要求去完成任务，上级党组织要十分注意加强对干部的政策教育和工作作风、工作方法的教育，使每一个干部真正懂得坚决执行党的政策的极端重要性，切实增强政策观念，严格按照政策去办事。同时要使每一个干部真正懂得树立良好的工作作风、工作方法的极端重要性，一定要通过发扬良好的工作作风，来贯彻执行政策和完成任务。这是一项十分重要的任务。
    在交任务的同时，交政策，交工作作风，这是提高干部水平的切实有效的方法。干部增强了政策观念，懂得了发扬正确作风的必要，又懂得了在每项工作中贯彻什么政策，怎样具体运用群众路线的工作方法，才能把具体任务完成好。所谓交任务，就是告诉干部一定时期要干什么，达到什么要求，并使干部了解为什么办这件事情，了解有利条件和可能遇到的困难。这就会增强干部完成任务的自觉性。由于实际情况是有差异的，在交代任务时，一定不要过死过急，以利于下边能够按具体情况进行工作。所谓交政策，就是要告诉干部进行某项工作时必须执行什么政策，为什么一定要执行这样的政策，划清政策界限。交代政策越深透，干部越懂得政策的精神，就越能把任务完成得好。我们既要反对只交任务不交政策，也要反对交代政策时的马虎草率态度。所谓交作风，就是要告诉干部在执行政策时，怎样很好地同群众商量，倾听群众的意见，做到按照具体情况去执行政策，并且要在执行政策中发挥模范带头作用。
    在贯彻执行政策完成任务的过程中，上级领导机关和领导干部，除了从以上三个方面具体地帮助干部，随时总结推广他们的好经验以外，还要检查他们在这三方面做的怎样，及时发现缺点和偏差，指导他们纠正。并且应当在最后完成任务时，严格检查他们是否贯彻了政策，是采用了什么方法完成任务的。如果只在部署工作时“三交”，不在完成任务的过程中作具体帮助，不随时检查发现问题并加以解决，那就不能保证工作任务的顺利完成，甚至会容忍错误的发生和发展。
    每一个干部对上级交代的任务、政策、作风，应当全面地去领会和接受，并且要认真按照上级的交代去办事，把党的政策不折不扣地贯彻到自己的工作中去。既不允许阳奉阴违，断章取义，也不允许马马虎虎。当然，这不是说可以不从实际出发，恰恰相反，党从来都是教导我们，必须使党的政策指示同当地的具体情况正确地结合起来。毛泽东同志说过：“凡属正确的任务、政策和工作作风，都是和当时当地的群众要求相适合，都是联系群众的；凡属错误的任务、政策和工作作风，都是和当时当地的群众要求不相适合，都是脱离群众的。”
    （《论联合政府》）我们应当牢记毛泽东同志的这一指示。如果是真正周密地研究了实际情况，感到上级提出的某一任务和某一要求不好办到，那就应该反映自己的意见，请求上级考虑。这样做，完全是对党对群众负责的表现。
    实事求是是与群众路线不可分的。坚持群众路线的中心一环是遇事和群众商量。只要把任务、政策交给群众，充分地发动群众讨论，倾听群众的呼声，采纳群众的正确意见，不仅可以集中群众的智慧，而且可以在群众的监督之下来贯彻党的政策，完成各项任务。如果口头上讲实事求是，却缺乏群众观点，也缺乏民主精神，不尊重群众的意见，自己专断行事，那没有不出错误的。
    总之，每个干部都应当有任务观点，更要有政策观点，又要讲求工作作风和工作方法，而且要切切实实地在工作中体现这三者的统一和一致。一个干部的工作是好是坏，应以此作为检查和衡量的标准。只要自觉地经常这样做，必能逐步提高自己的政策水平，改进工作作风，把自己培养成为一个优秀的干部，出色地完成党和群众交付的各项任务。
