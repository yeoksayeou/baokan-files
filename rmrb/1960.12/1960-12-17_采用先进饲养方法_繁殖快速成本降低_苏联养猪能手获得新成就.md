Xinhua News Agency, Moscow: Soviet pig farming experts in animal husbandry have achieved new and higher results in increasing the number of pigs raised, improving the reproduction and growth rate of pigs, and reducing product costs.

    As early as the beginning of this year, Soviet pig farming experts launched a competition to produce more inexpensive pork. Many advanced producers have switched to pig farming. Their experience proves that as long as advanced breeding methods are adopted, a large amount of pork can be produced in a short period of time.

    In the Omsk Oblast, the famous female pig farmer Pelesfuko plans to raise 2,200 pigs this year and sell 200 metric tons of pork to the state. Due to the implementation of mechanization and advanced group feeding methods, this pig farming expert has already delivered more than 3,500 pigs to the state in the first ten months of this year, totaling 318 metric tons. It is expected that she will deliver another 2,000 pigs, no less than 182 metric tons of pork, to the state by the end of this year. Pelesfuko also put forward a more advanced guarantee, deciding to raise 12,000 pigs next year and deliver 1200 metric tons of pork to the state.

    Ukrainian pig farming expert Chichi has maintained a national record in reducing pork costs. The pork he currently raises costs only 221 rubles per metric ton. He plans to reduce the cost of pork to 200 rubles per metric ton by the end of the year. His method of achieving this result relies mainly on feeding with inexpensive feed, in addition to implementing mechanized feeding methods.

    Latvian Socialist Labor Heroine, female pig farmer Ivanova, has achieved new and outstanding results in piglet reproduction. Ivanova originally planned to obtain 1,700 piglets from the sows she manages this year, but in the first ten months of this year, she has already obtained more than 2,100 piglets, an average of 25 piglets per sow. Ivanova is now proposing to obtain at least 3,000 piglets next year.

    Popov, a pig farmer at the "Volovichanin" state farm in the Novgorod Oblast, has made good achievements in over fulfilling the plan and reducing costs. He only switched from being a tractor driver to a pig farmer in May of this year. He planned to sell 200 metric tons of pork to the state from May to the end of the year, but by early October he had already raised more than 2,200 pigs and delivered more than 210 metric tons of pork to the state. The pigs he raises gain an average of half a kilogram per head per day. He plans to raise another 100 metric tons of pork for the farm by the end of the year.

    采用先进饲养方法　繁殖快速成本降低
    苏联养猪能手获得新成就
    新华社莫斯科电　苏联畜牧业中的养猪能手在增加喂猪数目、提高猪的繁殖和成长速度以及降低产品成本方面获得了新的更高的成绩。
    早在今年年初，苏联养猪能手们就发起了多生产价值低廉的猪肉的竞赛。许多先进生产者转到养猪方面来。他们的经验证明，只要采用先进的饲养方法就可以在短期内生产出大量的猪肉。
    在鄂木斯克州，著名养猪女工佩列斯符科今年计划养猪二千二百头，交售给国家猪肉二千公担。由于实行了机械化和先进的成群饲养的方法，这位养猪能手在今年头十个月中已交给国家三千五百多头猪，共重三千一百八十公担。预计，她到今年年底还要交给国家二千头，不少于一千八百二十公担猪肉。佩列斯符科还提出了更加先进的保证，她决定明年要养一万二千头猪，交给国家一万二千公担猪肉。
    乌克兰养猪能手契奇在降低猪肉成本上保持了全国纪录。他现在饲养的猪每公担猪肉只要二百二十一卢布。他计划到年底把猪肉成本降低到每公担二百卢布。他达到这个成绩的方法除了实行机械化饲养方法外，主要靠用价值低廉的饲料来饲养。
    拉脱维亚社会主义劳动英雄、女养猪员伊凡诺娃在小猪繁殖方面获得新的优异成绩。伊凡诺娃原计划今年从她管理的母猪中获得一千七百头小猪，但是在今年头十个月中，她已获得了二千一百多头，平均每条母猪产猪二十五头。伊凡诺娃现在提出明年至少要获得小猪三千头。
    诺夫哥罗德州“沃罗维恰宁”国营农场养猪员波波夫在超额完成计划、降低成本等方面都做出了良好成绩。他今年5月份才从拖拉机手转为养猪员。他计划从5月到年底卖给国家猪肉二千公担，但仅10月初他就饲养了二千二百多头，交给国家猪肉二千一百多公担。他喂养的猪平均每头每昼夜增加半公斤重。他计划到年底再为农场饲养出一千公担猪肉。
