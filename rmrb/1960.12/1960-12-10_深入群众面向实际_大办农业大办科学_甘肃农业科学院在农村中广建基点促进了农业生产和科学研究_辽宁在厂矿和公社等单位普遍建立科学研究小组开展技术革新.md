    Xinhua News Agency: Gansu Academy of Agricultural Sciences has adopted the method of "establishing extensive bases in rural areas, sending people on roving surveys, and appropriately retaining research in the institute," organizing scientific research personnel to step out of the research laboratory, go deep among the masses, face reality, and vigorously promote agriculture and science. This has both promoted agricultural production throughout the province and achieved a great harvest in scientific research.

    This year, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party led the people of the province in launching a drought resistance production campaign. The Academy regarded supporting drought resistance as an overriding task. The eight institutes under the Academy rushed to compile forty important materials, introducing more than fifty drought-resistant improved varieties to the people of the province, as well as drought-resistant cultivation techniques for the province's ten major crops. The twenty-seven research bases also took the initiative to offer advice and suggestions to the Party committees of the prefectures, counties, and cities, and put forward 217 pieces of technical data on drought-resistant production, powerfully supporting drought-resistant production.

    In implementing the mass line in scientific research, the Academy of Agricultural Sciences has linked up with eighty-nine rural people's communes, helped the communes run fifty small farms, cultivated ninety-three high-yield plots covering 23,000 mu, and created a one-stop working method of scientific experimental field—high-yield plot—general field for experimentation, research, and promotion, enabling the research results of scientific experimental fields to be quickly promoted and used in high-yield fields and general fields, increasing production and income.

    After the scientific research personnel went deep into the countryside, they labored together with the peasants and conducted experiments and research together, combining the summarization of experienced farmers' experience with the promotion of scientific and technological knowledge. For example, Ye Guoyu, a female Communist Party member and researcher at the Huining base, had no research data on stem borers when she first received the task of studying the prevention and control of millet stem borers in the spring of 1959. To solve this difficulty, she traveled all over the places where pests had occurred most severely over the years, visited more than seventy old farmers, and learned about the morphology of the pests and the symptoms of harm. After more than a year of hard work, she finally completed the research on the life history of millet stem borers and found effective prevention and control methods. The Huining County Party Committee immediately organized farmers to carry out a prevention and control campaign. During the campaign, Ye Guoyu traveled hundreds of miles on foot again, inspecting the prevention and control situation社by commune, village, and plot, imparting technology, and solving problems. This year, a total of 160,000 mu were treated throughout the county.

    After this Academy conscientiously implemented the working method of going deep into production practice and developing scientific research in the development of production, it has achieved a great harvest in scientific research, production, and thought year after year. In just one year and nine months since its establishment, it has completed 468 scientific research projects. The works completed by the Academy in collaboration with fraternal units include "Gansu Soil," "Gansu Wheat Cultivation," "Gansu Cotton Cultivation," and "Desert Fixation and Afforestation in the Hexi Corridor," and so on, ten kinds in total. It has cultivated and selected 64 improved varieties suitable for promotion in Gansu. In the past, many research results that were only studied in the research room often could not be universally promoted and used. Now, all research results take root and blossom locally, and can be promoted on a large scale and take effect in the same year. For example, this autumn, in order to prevent and control potato late blight, Comrade Liu Weimin, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of the Academy, led the roving inspection team to Minxian County, the main potato-producing area of Gansu, went deep into Chengguan Commune, which has been the most severely affected by the disease over the years, and repeatedly talked with old farmers, proposing many local and foreign prevention and control methods. He also led scientific and technological personnel to take sprayers and go to the fields with the peasants to prevent and control the disease, roving and promoting, and within a month, 60,000 mu were treated, preventing the spread of the disease and ensuring a bumper harvest. Through the exercise of labor production, the ideological awareness of scientific and technical personnel has been rapidly improved, and this year, 36 advanced workers have emerged in the Academy.

    Xinhua News Agency: In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, basic-level units such as factories, mines, enterprises, people's communes, hospitals, and schools in Liaoning Province have universally established mass scientific research groups. Under the leadership of Party organizations at all levels, these groups take members of the Science and Technology Association as the backbone and absorb the voluntary participation of the broad masses. It has become a place for the broad masses of workers and staff to conduct experimental research and learn scientific knowledge. With the development of mass scientific research work, the movement of technical innovation and technical revolution and industrial and agricultural production have been powerfully promoted.

    The staff scientific research organization of Benxi Alloy Factory overcame difficulties such as insufficient information and lack of equipment, and successfully trial-produced 45 new products, 13 of which were put into production, which played a great role in the factory completing its annual production plan eight months ahead of schedule. Dalian Shipyard, which established mass research groups earlier, has put forward more than 63,000 rationalization proposals in five months through research groups, summarized and promoted 3,667 advanced experiences, and carried out 818 special studies, which has greatly changed the face of production. For example, the riveting and welding scientific research group of the hull workshop successfully trial-produced one-time forming welding and universal welding machines, so that the workload of 150 welders in the past can now be completed by 20 people. The tool reform scientific research group of Hualong People's Commune in Xifeng County gave the diesel engine "legs" and made a "local tractor," which provided a new direction for the comprehensive utilization of drainage and irrigation machinery. In carrying out mass research, Yingkou City Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital successfully trial-produced more than ten kinds of electronic medical devices, which played a certain role in improving the quality of medical care.

    Mass scientific research groups are an auxiliary force for professional scientific research institutions and a reserve force for training scientific and technological experts from the working class. In the first half of this year, the Liaoning Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences hired 92 workers and workers from technical backgrounds who had achieved major inventions and innovations and made outstanding contributions in technical innovation and technical revolution as specially invited researchers.

    Recently, Liaoyang Paper Mill has also concentrated a group of outstanding veteran workers and technicians from various research groups in the factory to establish an amateur research institute.

    深入群众面向实际　大办农业大办科学
    甘肃农业科学院在农村中广建基点促进了农业生产和科学研究
    辽宁在厂矿和公社等单位普遍建立科学研究小组开展技术革新
    本报讯　甘肃农业科学院，采取“农村广建基点，派人巡回调查，适当留院研究”的方法，组织科学研究人员走出研究室，深入群众，面向实际，大办农业、大办科学，既推动了全省的农业生产，又获得了科学研究的大丰收。
    今年，中共甘肃省委领导全省人民开展了抗旱生产运动，科学院就将支援抗旱列为压倒一切的任务。院属八个研究所突击编写了四十种重要材料，向全省人民介绍了五十多种抗旱良种，和全省十种主要作物的抗旱栽培技术措施。二十七个研究基点也都主动给地、县、市党委献计献策，提出抗旱生产技术资料二百一十七件，有力地支援了抗旱生产。
    农业科学院在贯彻群众路线的科学研究方针中和八十九个农村人民公社挂了钩，帮助公社办了五十个小农场，培养了九十三个丰产方，面积二万三千亩，并创造了科学试验田——丰产方——一般田试验、研究、推广一条龙的工作方法，使科学试验田的研究成果能够迅速在丰产田、一般田里推广使用，增产增收。
    科学研究人员深入农村以后，和农民一起劳动，共同试验研究，把总结老农经验和推广科学技术结合了起来。如会宁基点的女共产党员、研究员叶国玉，1959年春天刚接到研究防治糜子钻心虫任务的时候，没有一点关于钻心虫的研究资料。为解决这个困难，她走遍了历年来发生虫害最严重的地方，访问了七十多个老农，了解害虫的形态和危害的症状。经过一年多的刻苦钻研，终于完成了糜子钻心虫生活史的研究，找出了有效的防治办法，会宁县委立即组织农民开展防治运动。运动中，叶国玉又徒步奔走数百里，逐社逐村逐片检查防治情况，传授技术，解决问题。今年，全县共防治了十六万亩。
    这个科学院，在认真实行了深入生产实际，在发展生产中发展科学研究的工作方法以后，连年来取得了科学研究、生产、思想齐丰收。建院才一年零九个月，已完成科学研究项目四百六十八项。该院和各兄弟单位协作完成的著作，有“甘肃土壤”、“甘肃小麦栽培学”、“甘肃棉花栽培学”、“河西走廊固沙造林”等十种。培育和选育出适于在甘肃推广的良种达六十四种。从前只关在研究室里研究的许多研究成果，往往不能普遍推广使用。现在的各项研究成果都是就地生根开花，可以当年大面积推广生效。如今年秋天，为了防治洋芋晚疫病，该院党委副书记刘卫民同志，领导巡回检查组，到甘肃洋芋主要产地岷县，深入历年来发病最严重的城关公社和老农反复座谈，提出了很多种土、洋防治办法，还领着科技人员拿着喷雾器和农民一同下地防治，巡回推广，不到一月就防治了六万亩，制止了疫病蔓延，保证了丰收。通过劳动生产的锻炼，科学技术人员的思想觉悟迅速提高，今年全院涌现的先进工作者达三十六人。
    本报讯　辽宁各厂矿、企业、人民公社、医院、学校等基层单位，在技术革新、技术革命运动中，普遍建立群众性的科学研究小组。这些小组在各级党组织领导下，以科学技术协会会员为骨干，吸收广大群众自愿参加。它已成为广大职工群众进行试验研究和学习科学知识的场所。随着群众性科学研究工作的发展，有力地推动了技术革新、技术革命运动和工农业生产。
    本溪合金厂的职工科学研究组织，克服了资料不足、设备缺乏等困难，试制成功四十五种新产品，其中十三种投入生产，对全厂提前八个月完成全年生产计划起了很大作用。群众性研究小组设立较早的大连造船厂，通过研究小组，在五个月当中提出合理化建议六万三千多件，总结推广了三千六百六十七项先进经验，开展了八百一十八项专题研究，使生产面貌大大改观。例如船体车间铆焊科研小组试制成功一次成型焊和万能焊接机，使过去一百五十名电焊工的工作量，现在由二十个人即可完成。西丰县化隆人民公社工具改革科研小组给柴油机“长腿”，制成了“土拖拉机”，为排灌机械的综合利用提供了新的方向。营口市中医院开展群众性研究中，试制成功十多种电子学医疗器械，对提高医疗质量起了一定作用。
    群众性科学研究小组是专业科学研究机构的辅助力量，和培养工人阶级科学技术专家的后备队伍。今年上半年，中国科学院辽宁分院就聘请了九十二名在技术革新、技术革命中实现了重大发明创造和做出卓越贡献的工人和工人出身的技术人员为特约研究员。
    最近，辽阳造纸厂也从全厂各个研究小组中，集中了一批优秀的老工人和技术人员，成立了一个业余研究院。
