Taking the Method of Sending Cadres Down to Guide Apprentices
Jiuyuan Commune Works Hard to Train Grassroots Cadres

    (Reported by our newspaper) The Party Committee of Jiuyuan People's Commune in Fugou County, Henan Province, has adopted the method of sending cadres down to guide apprentices, starting with training cadres to strengthen leadership over backward teams. Because the dispatched cadres worked hard and deeply, led by example, and cared for the growth of grassroots cadres in every possible way, in just a few months, a large number of grassroots cadres have become outstanding leading backbone. The backward teams have now changed their original appearance, and half of the teams have jumped into the ranks of advanced teams.

    The Jiuyuan People's Commune has seven production brigades. In addition to being backward due to poor soil, little land, and years of disasters, a prominent common problem is the weakness of the leadership. Plus, they are located in remote areas of the commune. In the past, responsible cadres of the commune went less often, and specific help was insufficient. Therefore, these brigades still lack a set of experience in organizing collective production and management. To change this situation, the commune Party committee transferred four deputy secretaries to work in these teams. Now, 42 cadres have settled in these seven teams, including 15 cadres at the county section and bureau chief level, and three-quarters are party members, most of whom are excellent cadres who can work independently. According to the specific conditions of these teams, the commune Party committee instructed this group of cadres to first start with training grassroots cadres, take root and blossom in backward teams, and change the backward face as soon as possible.

    The dispatched cadres adopted the "five-character work method" of "package, teach, lead, help, and build" to cultivate grassroots cadres and help them improve. "Package" means contract responsibility. These dispatched cadres have assumed leadership positions such as secretary or deputy secretary of the Party branch, and deputy captain of the brigade or team, and are responsible for the training of cadres in the same position until they can work independently.

    "Teach" means to conduct political education and care about their growth. The communists dispatched to these backward teams paid great attention to improving the political and ideological level of the team cadres. Each of them has a booklet of Chairman Mao's "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Work Methods" and "Serving the People," and often take time to organize team cadres to study. After studying, the cadres of Cao Tai Brigade, the branch secretary and the captain contracted teams, stationed in the canteen, and were fully responsible. Now the cadres and the masses of the whole team are full of vitality in production and life.

    "Lead" means to lead by example, be a role model. The cadres who work in these teams, each with their own active labor, resolutely implement the policies, and have the practical action of consulting with the masses in everything to influence and drive the team cadres. After the dispatched cadres arrived in the team, they first helped the brigade cadres implement the "four fixings" of land, labor, livestock, and farm tools for the team, allowing the team to fully exercise the "three rights" (planting according to local conditions, formulating technical measures, and arranging farm work), which promoted the enthusiasm of the commune members.

    "Help" means specific help and bold use. In the specific work process, the dispatched cadres adopted the method of planning in advance, guiding in the middle, and summarizing afterwards to help the team cadres calculate work in sections, lines (production, life, etc.), and days, study methods, let them meet with the masses, and directly do it, cultivate their ability to work independently, and establish prestige among the masses.

    "Build" means to establish a system. While helping team cadres improve their work ability, the dispatched cadres also helped team cadres establish four systems: production, life, finance, and rewards and punishments, so that the production organization and life management of the brigade and team can be carried out in an orderly manner. The production management system of Cao Tai Brigade stipulates that the team is the unit to organize production and allocate and use labor. The brigade implements "three guarantees and one reward" for the team, the team implements fixed quota contracting for the operation group, the group evaluates work and records points for commune members. If cooperation is required between teams, it is organized by the brigade according to the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, and the labor-using unit pays remuneration or exchanges labor in kind according to the principle of equal value; male commune members have two days of vacation per month, and female commune members have four days of vacation. The life management system of Miaotou Brigade stipulates that a ten-day meal schedule system and a commune member representative assistance system are implemented. The branch secretary and members of the brigade each contract a canteen, regularly participate in cooking labor, and eat the same as the commune members. The financial management system stipulates that work points are cleared every ten days and settled once a month. Due to the establishment and strict implementation of these systems, the enthusiasm of team cadres and commune members to do a good job in production has been fully mobilized.

    The cadres newly trained in the backward teams have great enthusiasm, high spirits, and conscientiously implement the Party's various policies, so that the face of these seven teams has undergone great changes, which has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members. Now, except for Du Fen Brigade, the remaining six brigades have reversed the situation of grain shortage in previous years. This year, not only is there enough grain to eat, but Miaotou, Zhugang and other four brigades also have reserve grain. The commune members witnessed the fact that cadres worked hard and the production face changed dramatically, and each of them was in high spirits, actively working and participating in management.

    采取下放干部以师带徒的办法
    韭园公社努力培养基层干部
    本报讯　河南省扶沟县韭园人民公社党委，采取下放干部以师带徒的办法，从培养干部入手，加强对后进队的领导。由于下放干部艰苦深入，以身作则，无微不至的关怀基层干部的成长，只几个月时间，已有大批基层干部成为出色的领导骨干，后进队现在已经改变了原来的面貌，并有一半队跃到先进队行列。
    韭园人民公社有七个生产大队，因土质差、土地少以及连年遭灾等而造成的后进以外，共同存在的一个突出问题是领导力量薄弱。加上处于公社的边远地区。过去公社的负责干部去的较少，具体帮助不够，所以这些大队尚缺乏一套组织集体生产和经营管理的经验，为改变这种状况，公社党委抽出四位副书记到这些队工作。现在，安家落户在这七个队的干部达四十二人，其中县科、局长级干部十五人，四分之三都是党员，大都是能够独立工作的优秀干部，公社党委根据这些队的具体情况，指示这批干部首先从培养基层干部入手，在后进队生根开花，尽快地改变落后面貌。
    下放干部培养基层干部采取了“包、教、带、帮、建”的五字工作法，帮助他们提高。“包”是包干负责。这批下放干部，到基层都分别担任了党支部的书记或副书记、大队或小队的副队长等领导职务，分工负责同职干部的培养工作，直到他们能够很好地独立工作为止。
    “教”是从政治上进行教育，关心他们的成长，下放到这些后进队的共产党员们，非常注意队干部政治思想水平的提高，他们每人都有一本毛主席《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》和《为人民服务》的小册子，经常抽空组织队干部学习。曹台大队的干部，通过学习后，支部书记和队长分包小队，驻在食堂，包干负责。现在全队干部和群众生产生活一片生气勃勃。
    “带”是以师带徒，做出榜样，到这些队工作的干部，个个以自己的积极劳动，坚决执行政策，有事与群众商量的实际行动去影响和带动队干部，下放干部到队后，首先帮助大队干部给小队实行了土地、劳力、牲畜、农具“四固定”，让小队充分行使“三权”（因地种植，制定技术措施，安排农活），促进了社员的劳动积极性。
    “帮”是具体帮助，大胆使用。在具体工作过程中，下放干部采取了事先有计划，中间有指导，事后有总结的办法，帮助队干部分段、分线（生产、生活等）、分天计算工作，研究办法，让他们与群众见面，直接去作，培养他们独立工作的能力，在群众中树立威信。
    “建”是建立制度。下放干部在帮助队干部提高工作能力的同时，还帮助队干部建立了生产、生活、财务、奖惩等四项制度，使大队和小队的生产组织和生活管理工作，有秩序的进行，曹台大队的生产管理制度规定：以小队为单位组织生产和调配、使用劳动力，大队对小队实行“三包一奖”，小队对作业组实行定额包工，组对社员评工记分，小队之间需要进行协作，根据自愿和互利原则，由大队组织，用工单位按等价交换原则付给报酬或以工抵工；男社员每月休假两天，女社员休假四天。庙头大队的生活管理制度规定：实行十日饭表制和社员代表帮助制，大队的支部书记和委员，每人分包一个食堂，定期参加炊事劳动，吃饭和社员一样。财务管理制度各队都规定了工分十天一清理，一月一结算。由于这些制度的建立和严格执行，充分调动了小队干部和社员搞好生产的积极性。
    在后进队新培养起来的这批干部，热情大，劲头高，认真贯彻执行党的各项政策，使这七个队的面貌都有了很大的变化，从而也大大鼓舞了广大社员的积极性。现在除杜坟大队以外，其余六个大队都扭转了以往年年缺粮的局面，今年不仅粮食够吃，庙头、朱岗等四个大队还留有储备粮。社员们目睹干部踏实工作，生产面貌急剧变化的事实，个个精神振奋，积极劳动和参加管理。
