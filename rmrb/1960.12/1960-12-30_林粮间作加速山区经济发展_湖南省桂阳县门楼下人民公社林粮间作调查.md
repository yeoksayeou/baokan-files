Intercropping of Trees and Grain Accelerates Economic Development in Mountainous Areas
An Investigation of Intercropping of Trees and Grain in the Menlouxia People's Commune, Guiyang County, Hunan Province
By Our Correspondent Zhang Guangyou

The Menlouxia People's Commune in Guiyang County, Hunan Province, is located in the northwestern part of the Nanling Mountains. The total area of the commune is more than 400,000 mu, almost all of which is barren mountains and sparse woodland. The cultivated land area is only 2,600 mu. Calculated according to the total population of 6,022 people in the commune, the average cultivated land area per person is less than half a mu, so it has long been a grain-deficient area. After liberation, although the unit area yield and total output of grain increased rapidly, grain production still could not be self-sufficient due to the large number of mountains and the small amount of cultivated land. However, this year, the Menlouxia People's Commune has undergone a tremendous change: it has completely changed the grain-deficient situation, and the mountainous economy has developed rapidly.

Nourishing Forestry with Agriculture, Producing Grain on Forest Land

Why has this commune been able to undergo such a huge change in such a short period of time? This is because they have found a shortcut to comprehensively and rapidly develop the mountainous economy—vigorously engaging in intercropping of trees and grain.

After the Party put forward the policy of "taking grain as the key link and developing in an all-round way" last winter, the Menlouxia People's Commune vigorously engaged in intercropping of trees and grain while continuously increasing the unit area yield of existing cultivated land. Last winter and this spring, the commune reclaimed more than 40,000 mu of mountains for afforestation. This spring, all newly afforested young forest land was intercropped with grain. The fact that large-scale intercropping of trees and grain has yielded a bumper harvest powerfully illustrates that grain production in mountainous areas can develop at a high speed. The main benefits of intercropping of trees and grain are:

1. Increased grain production. This year, the Menlouxia People's Commune intercropped more than 41,000 mu of grain crops in forest land. According to statistics in early October, the various grains harvested on more than 14,000 mu of forest land were more than 300,000 jin more than the total grain output of the commune last year.

2. Accelerated afforestation speed. Intercropping of trees and grain simultaneously nurtures young forests, greatly improving the survival rate of afforestation and promoting the rapid growth and high yield of trees. This year, the afforestation area of the Menlouxia People's Commune has developed to more than 40,000 mu due to the vigorous intercropping of trees and grain, an increase of more than five times compared with last year, equivalent to twice the total afforestation area since liberation. Judging from the quality of afforestation and the growth of trees, the trees have been nurtured by carrying out field management measures such as cultivation, weeding, topdressing, drought resistance, and pest control for crops. Because the thorns and weeds on the barren mountains are cut down before afforestation and intercropping, and burned after drying to become ash fertilizer, the surface of the land two to three inches is also burned into fire soil fertilizer, plus the fallen branches and leaves of trees and crops, which increases the amount of phosphorus, potassium, and organic fertilizers in the soil, increasing soil fertility. In summer, when the newly planted young forests are small and cannot withstand sun and wind, the crops shield the young trees from sunlight and reduce soil moisture evaporation. Therefore, the survival rate of afforestation is greatly improved and the growth of trees is promoted. According to the survey, the afforestation survival rate in the intercropping area this year is generally above 90%, which is about 30% higher than the survival rate without intercropping in previous years. The height of one-year-old Chinese fir seedlings in intercropping is generally about one and a half feet, while the height of those without intercropping is generally less than one foot.

3. Intercropping of trees and grain is a good method of nourishing forestry with agriculture, using short-term gains to support long-term development, and combining current and long-term interests. According to the natural conditions of the mountainous area, the Menlouxia People's Commune has summarized the experience of small-scale intercropping of trees and grain in recent years and adopted a ten-year rotation method in large-scale intercropping of trees and grain. They planted Chinese fir and tung oil (three-year tung) at the same time on newly reclaimed mountain land, and grain was planted between the trees. In the first three years, grain can be harvested because the trees are young; after three years, the trees grow up, and grain crops are no longer intercropped, but this is the peak fruiting period of tung oil, producing a large amount of tung oil; after the seventh year, the peak fruiting period of tung oil has passed, at this time Chinese fir has begun to mature, and after the Chinese fir is cut down, the ten-year rotation is restarted. In this way, it becomes a grain production base in the early stage and a timber production base in the later stage.

4. Solved the contradiction between agricultural and forestry production. The contradiction between agricultural and forestry production in the Menlouxia People's Commune is mainly manifested in the competition for labor and land. This commune has a large area of barren mountains, and after liberation, the broad masses of commune members have an urgent desire to green the barren mountains and transform the natural landscape. However, because grain production cannot be self-sufficient, a large number of laborers need to be taken out every year to engage in sideline occupations to earn cash income to purchase grain; at the same time, the afforestation season is often the busy season for agricultural production, and it is impossible to draw a large amount of labor to invest in forestry production (afforestation, forest cultivation) that has no current income. After the implementation of large-scale intercropping of trees and grain, one labor force completed two tasks, solving the contradiction between agriculture and forestry in competing for labor. At the same time, using forest land to produce grain also overcomes the difficulty of insufficient cultivated land.

5. Intercropping of trees and grain uses less labor and yields great benefits. This year, the Jiufeng Forest Farm of this commune intercropped 17,000 mu of trees and grain, with an average of 6.9 workdays per mu. Calculated according to the average unit area yield of the harvested area, each workday produced 23.9 jin of grain (not including the income from trees).

Increased Grain Production, Thriving Industries

Due to the vigorous intercropping of trees and grain, the Menlouxia People's Commune has solved the grain problem and promoted the development of the entire mountainous economy. The number of pigs in stock in the commune increased by 47.2% compared with the end of last year; the number of chickens and ducks increased by more than one time compared with last year; the income from sideline production (statistics as of the end of September this year) increased by 78.6% compared with the income for the whole year last year. The development of agricultural production has also greatly promoted the development of commune-run industrial production. In the past year, the commune has established more than 50 commune-run and team-run factories, such as farm tool factories, paper mills, and non-staple food processing factories, and the total industrial output value (statistics as of the end of September this year) is more than two and a half times more than the whole year last year.

Intercropping of trees and grain is not a new discovery for the Menlouxia People's Commune. The Yao and Han people here have had the habit of intercropping for many years. However, large-scale promotion and as a shortcut to high-speed development of the mountainous economy can only be realized today. Before liberation, more than 90% of the forests here were occupied by bureaucrats and landlords, and the people lived in extreme poverty and had no power to open up mountains for grain planting. In the early days of liberation, although all the forests became the property of the people, no one had the power to engage in large-scale intercropping of trees and grain. Individual farmers could only think about it but could not achieve it. Mutual aid groups and cooperatives were stronger, but they could only engage in small-scale operations. Due to decentralized management, the benefits were not high. After the establishment of the People's Commune, because the commune jointly established 106 public canteens, 44 nurseries, and 5 kindergartens, and organized sewing groups, supply and marketing stores, etc., the development of these public welfare undertakings thoroughly liberated the Yao and Han women, who accounted for about one-half of the commune, and tapped the potential of the labor force for large-scale intercropping of trees and grain. The commune carried out unified planning and decentralized management of the large area of barren mountains in the commune, creating favorable conditions for large-scale intercropping of trees and grain.

Maintaining Water and Soil and Changing the Appearance of Mountainous Areas

The People's Commune has created favorable conditions for large-scale intercropping of trees and grain, but the implementation of large-scale intercropping of trees and grain in this commune is still due to the production policy of "taking grain as the key link and developing in an all-round way" put forward by the Party last year, which pointed out the direction for the development of the mountainous economy. According to the policy put forward by the Party, the Party Committee of the Menlouxia Commune seriously analyzed and studied the specific situation in this area. Before liberation, the broad masses of working people here lived a life of half a year of coarse grains and vegetables. In previous years after liberation, most of the grain relied on supplies from other places. The transportation here is extremely inconvenient. A rugged mountain road that livestock and wheelbarrows cannot pass is the transportation route of the commune to the outside world. According to the statistics of the Menlouxia People's Commune, last year alone, the labor spent on transporting grain on this small road reached about 100,000, averaging about one and a half months per laborer per year in the commune. For the country, it has increased the burden of grain. For a long time, the people of Yao Mountain have deeply realized that to comprehensively and rapidly develop production and change the economic landscape, it is necessary to firmly grasp grain production. However, the area of cultivated land in this area is small, and all the flat land has been reclaimed, and the expansion of the area of cultivated land is limited. Efforts to increase the yield per unit area alone cannot solve the problem of grain consumption in the entire commune. If we only go up the mountain to plant grain, it will inevitably cause soil erosion, and it will not be possible to plant for three or two years (because of soil loss). Under this situation, the Party Committee of the Menlouxia People's Commune summarized the experience of intercropping trees and grain in this area for many years and chose this important way to engage in large-scale intercropping of trees and grain to fundamentally change the backward and poor outlook and rapidly develop various productions.

The Victory of the Party, the Victory of the People

Letting the barren mountains become forest mountains and grain mountains is the result of a fierce battle of the Yao Mountain people marching towards nature. In this battle, the Party Committee of the commune and cadres at all levels have always played the role of a fighting fortress. In the vigorous intercropping of trees and grain, Deng Kuanfa, the first secretary of the Party Committee, climbed mountains and ridges and visited 57 old farmers. In order to overcome the lack of intercropping technology and ensure that water and soil are not lost, the Party Committee of the commune and the general branches of the brigades have successively held 27 symposiums of experienced old farmers. The secretary of the Party Committee personally led and organized relevant personnel to travel thousands of miles to Jinlong Mountain in Huitong County to learn from experience, and built more than 30 mu of experimental fields for the secretary of the Party Committee to create and promote a complete set of water and soil conservation experience.

The broad masses are the decisive force in conquering Yao Mountain. Because the Yao Mountain people deeply realized the great significance of large-scale intercropping of trees and grain, under the leadership of the Party, they were all enthusiastic and overcame many difficulties. When the commune began to organize the entire commune to march to Jiufeng Mountain, there were no people in the Jiufeng Mountain area for more than 20 miles. Without a place to live, the commune members built their own houses and erected sheds. Without vegetables to eat, they dug wild vegetables on the mountain. With insufficient labor, the commune members vigorously carried out technical innovations. Zhao Wanrong (Yao nationality), deputy captain of the Aobei Production Team of Banqiao Brigade and a Communist Party member, created a mountain corn seeder, which increased work efficiency by more than two times. The broad masses of commune members here have a common determination: "No matter how high the mountain is, there is no firm will, no difficulties in front of heroes, we will fight Yao Mountain to plant grain trees, and we will not leave Yao Mountain until it changes."

    林粮间作加速山区经济发展
    湖南省桂阳县门楼下人民公社林粮间作调查
    本报记者　张广友
    湖南桂阳县门楼下人民公社位于南岭大山区的西北部。全社总面积约四十多万亩，其中几乎全部都是荒山和疏林地，耕地面积只有二千六百亩，按全社总人口六千零二十二人计算，平均每人占有耕地面积还不到半亩，因此过去长期是一个缺粮地区。解放后，粮食单位面积产量和总产量虽然都有了迅速的增长，但是由于山多耕地少，粮食生产仍不能自给。然而今年门楼下人民公社却发生了一个翻天复地的大变化：彻底改变了缺粮面貌，山区经济有了迅速的发展。
    以农养林，林地产粮
    这个公社为什么能够在短短的一年时间内发生了如此巨大的变化？这是由于他们找到了一条全面的高速度的发展山区经济的捷径——大搞林粮间作。
    去年冬天党提出“以粮为纲，全面发展”的方针以后，门楼下人民公社在不断提高现有耕地单位面积产量的同时，大搞林粮间作。去冬今春全社共垦山造林四万多亩。今春在新造幼林地里全部间种了粮食。大面积林粮间作获得丰收的事实，有力地说明了山区粮食生产是可以高速度发展的。林粮间作的好处主要是：
    1，增加了粮食生产。门楼下人民公社今年在林地中间作的粮食作物共四万一千多亩。到10月上旬统计，已经在一万四千多亩林地上收获的各种粮食，就比去年全社的粮食总产量还多三十多万斤。
    2，加快了造林速度。林粮间作同时抚育了幼林，大大提高了造林成活率，促进林木速生丰产。今年门楼下人民公社由于大搞林粮间作，造林面积发展到四万多亩，比去年增长了五倍多，相当于解放后几年以来造林总面积的两倍。从造林的质量和林木生长情况来看，由于给农作物进行中耕、除草、追肥、抗旱、治虫等田间管理措施，使林木得到了抚育。由于在造林和间作之前砍去荒山的荆棘、杂草，晒干后经过焚烧变成灰肥，经过焚烧地表二至三寸也变成了火土肥，加上林木和农作物的枯枝落叶等，使土壤中增加了大量的磷钾肥和有机质肥料，增加了土壤肥力。夏季，当新造幼林较小经不起日灼风袭时，农作物为幼树遮蔽阳光，减少了土壤水分蒸发。因此大大提高了造林成活率，促进了林木生长。据调查，今年林粮间作地区中的造林成活率，一般都在90％以上，比往年没有间作的成活率提高了30％左右。间作一年生的杉木实生幼林一般高一尺半左右，没有间作的一般都在一尺以下。
    3，林粮间作是以农养林，以短养长，使当前利益和长远利益相结合的好办法。门楼下人民公社根据山区的自然条件，总结了几年来小面积林粮间作的经验，在大面积林粮间作中，采取十年轮作的方法。他们在新开垦的山地上，同时栽上了杉木和油桐（三年桐），林间又种上了粮食。前三年因为林木幼小，可收粮食；三年以后树木长大，不再间作粮食作物，而这时正是油桐结果盛期，生产大量油桐；到第七年以后油桐结果盛期已过，这时杉木已经开始成材，待杉木成材砍伐以后，再重新开始十年轮作。这样作到了初期是粮食生产基地，以后是木材生产基地。
    4，解决了农林业生产之间的矛盾。农业和林业生产之间的矛盾，在门楼下人民公社突出表现在争劳力和争土地这两方面。这个社有着大面积的荒山，解放后广大社员对于绿化荒山改造自然面貌，有着迫切的愿望。但是由于粮食生产不能自给，每年需要拿出大批劳力搞副业，抓现金收入，购买粮食；同时每年造林季节，又多是农业生产大忙季节，不可能抽出大量的劳力，投入没有当前收入的林业生产（造林、育林）。实行大面积林粮间作以后，用一份劳力完成了两项工作，解决了农林业之间争劳力的矛盾。同时利用林地生产粮食，也克服了耕地不足的困难。
    5，林粮间作用工少，收益大。今年这个社的九峰林场，林粮间作一万七千亩，平均每亩用工六点九个。按已收面积的平均单位面积产量计算，每个劳动日生产粮食二十三点九斤（林木收入还没包括在内）。
    粮食增产，百业兴旺
    门楼下人民公社由于大搞林粮间作，解决了粮食问题，带动了整个山区经济的发展。全社的生猪存栏头数，比去年年底增长了47.2％；鸡、鸭比去年增长一倍多；副业生产的收入（到今年9月底的统计）比去年全年的收入增长了78.6％。农业生产的发展，也大大促进了社办工业生产的发展。一年来全社共办起农具厂、造纸厂、副食品加工厂等社办、队办工厂五十多个，工业总产值（到今年9月底统计）比去年全年还多两倍半。
    林粮间作在门楼下人民公社来说，不是一个什么新的发现，这里的瑶、汉两族人民多年来就有这种间作的习惯。但是，大面积的推广和作为高速度发展山区经济的捷径，只有今天才可能实现。解放前这里的山林90％以上为官僚地主所霸占，人民生活极端困苦，无力开山种粮。解放初期，全部山林虽然成为人民财产，可是要大搞林粮间作谁也没有力量。单干农民只能想而不能及，互助组和合作社力量大了些，也只能小面积搞，由于经营分散，收益不高。人民公社成立以后，由于全社共建立了一百零六个公共食堂，四十四个托儿所，五个幼儿园，同时组织了缝纫组、供销店等，这些公共福利事业的发展，使占全社二分之一左右的瑶、汉两族妇女得到彻底解放，为大搞林粮间作挖掘了劳力潜力。公社对全社大面积的荒山进行了统一规划分片经营，为大面积林粮间作创造了有利的条件。
    保持水土改变山区面貌
    人民公社为大面积林粮间作创造了有利条件，但是这个公社的实行大面积林粮间作还是由于去年党提出“以粮为纲，全面发展”的生产方针，为山区经济发展指出了方向以后。门楼下公社党委根据党所提出的方针，认真的分析研究了这个地区的具体情况。解放前，这里的广大劳动人民过着是糠菜半年粮的生活。解放后历年来大部分粮食都是依靠外地供应。而这里的交通又极为不便，一条连牲畜和独轮车都无法通行的崎岖山路，就是这个公社对外的交通要道。国家每年统销给这个公社的一百多万斤粮食，全部都要通过这条小路用人担肩背运进。据门楼下人民公社统计，去年仅这一段小路运粮所花费的劳力即达十万个左右，平均全社每个劳力每年运粮要花费一个半月左右的时间。对国家来说增加了粮食负担。瑶山人民长期以来，已经深深的体会到，要全面的高速度的发展生产，改变经济面貌，必须狠狠抓住粮食生产。但是这个地区耕地面积少，所有的平地已经全部开垦，扩大耕地面积受到限制。单从提高单位面积产量上努力，目前也不可能全部解决全社用粮问题。如果单独上山种粮必然要引起水土冲刷，而且也种不了三两年（因为土壤失肥）。在这种情况下，门楼下人民公社党委，总结了这个地区多年来林粮间作的经验，选择了这个大搞林粮间作从根本上改变落后贫困面貌，迅速发展各项生产的重要途径。
    党的胜利，人民的胜利
    让荒山变成了林山、粮山，这是瑶山人民向大自然进军的一场激烈战斗的结果。在这场战斗中，公社党委和各级干部始终起着战斗堡垒的作用。党委第一书记邓宽发同志在大搞林粮间作中，爬山越岭，访问了老农五十七人。为了克服林粮间作技术不足的困难，保证水土不流失，公社党委和大队总支曾先后召开了二十七次有经验的老农座谈会。公社党委书记亲自领导，组织有关人员远走千里，到会同县金龙山去取经，并且建了三十多亩党委书记试验田，创造和推广了一整套的水土保持经验。
    广大群众是征服瑶山的决定力量。瑶山人民由于深刻认识到大搞林粮间作的伟大意义，他们在党的领导下，个个干劲冲天，战胜了重重困难。在公社开始组织全社向九峰山进军时，那时九峰山地区纵横二十余里没有人家。没有住处，社员们就自己盖起房屋，架起工棚。没有蔬菜吃，他们就在山上挖山菜。劳力不足，社员们就大闹技术革新。板桥大队坳背生产队副队长、共产党员赵万荣（瑶族）创造了山地玉米播种器，提高工效两倍多。这里的广大社员都有一个共同的决心：“山高没有意志坚，英雄面前没困难，大战瑶山种粮树，瑶山不变不下山。”
