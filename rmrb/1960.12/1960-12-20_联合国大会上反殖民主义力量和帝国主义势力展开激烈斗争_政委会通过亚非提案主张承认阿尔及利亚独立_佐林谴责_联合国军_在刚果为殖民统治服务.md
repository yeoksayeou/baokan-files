Xinhua News Agency, December 16th: New York Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee concluded its ten-day debate on the Algerian question on the 15th. Despite the opposition of the United States, Britain, and other Western countries supporting France's colonial war in Algeria, the meeting passed a proposal put forward by twenty-four Afro-Asian countries demanding recognition of the Algerian people's right to self-determination and independence, with forty-seven votes in favor, twenty against, and twenty-eight abstentions.

The Afro-Asian countries' proposal advocated "recognizing the Algerian people's right to self-determination and independence" and "recognizing the urgent need to provide full and effective guarantees to ensure the successful and just exercise of the right to self-determination, respecting Algeria's unity and territorial integrity."

At the same time, the Afro-Asian countries' proposal believed that "the United Nations has a responsibility to contribute to the successful and just exercise of this right." The proposal advocated "holding a referendum in Algeria, organized, supervised, and monitored by the United Nations."

Countries supporting the Afro-Asian proposal included Afro-Asian countries, socialist countries, and some Western European and Latin American countries. The United States, Britain, Italy, France's NATO allies, and some Latin American countries controlled by the United States voted against it.

In the debates on the 14th and 15th, representatives of the United States and Britain spoke, attempting to obstruct the passage of the Afro-Asian countries' proposal, once again demonstrating that they are enemies of the Afro-Asian national independence movement. U.S. Representative Wilcox attacked the Afro-Asian countries' proposal at the meeting on the 15th as "hindering rather than helping the solution of the (Algerian) problem."

Soviet Representative Zorin read a TASS statement on the Algerian question at the meeting on the 15th. Zorin reiterated that the Soviet delegation believes it is necessary to quickly resolve the Algerian issue and stop the bloodshed in Algeria.

Representatives of Romania, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Ukraine, the United Arab Republic, and other countries who spoke at the two-day meeting expressed their support for the Algerian people's struggle for national independence in their speeches.

Xinhua News Agency, December 19th: New York Dispatch: At a plenary meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on the 17th, continuing to discuss the situation in the Congo, Cuban Foreign Minister Roa pointed out in his speech that the adoption of the declaration requiring the end of colonialism by the United Nations General Assembly was a huge moral defeat for colonialism. However, imperialism still has enough power to threaten international peace and security. The current situation in the Congo is a danger.

Roa pointed out that the real purpose of the NATO member states in the Congo has been clearly exposed. Imperialists and colonialists have stifled the independence of the Congo. The resolutions of the United Nations Security Council and General Assembly cater to the interests of U.S. imperialism and colonialism.

The Indonesian representative said that the chaotic situation and lawless behavior in the Congo are caused by imperialist armed intervention.

Albanian Representative Malile emphasized at the meeting that U.S. imperialism plays a major role in the conspiracy against the Congolese people. The "UN forces" command openly colludes with the aggressors, thus losing its reputation.

Bulgarian Representative Chobanov also demanded that the central government and parliament of the Congo resume their activities and that the Mobutu bandits be disarmed.

U.S. Representative Wadsworth at the meeting quibbled about the crimes of the U.S. aggression against the Congo. He insisted that disarming the Mobutu group would lead to the "weakening of constructive forces" in the Congo, saying that "any such attempt is an aggression." In his speech, Wadsworth called on all UN member states to support the U.S.'s actions in interfering in the Congo under the guise of the UN.

Belgian Representative Loridan stated in his speech that the Belgian colonialists are determined to stay in the Congo.

Romanian Representative Micescu expressed indignation at the speeches of the U.S. and Belgian representatives and sternly refuted them.

United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld openly demanded the expansion of his power to interfere in the Congo. He demanded "strengthening the rights of the United Nations" and purposefully demanded the prohibition of so-called "unilateral interference" in the Congo situation by all United Nations member states.

Xinhua News Agency, December 17th: According to TASS, New York: The United Nations General Assembly plenary meeting on the morning of the 16th resumed discussion of the Congo situation raised by the Soviet Union.

Soviet delegation leader Zorin spoke first at the meeting. He pointed out that the Congo situation is deteriorating, and Western colonialists have shamelessly begun a new stage in implementing their destructive policies in the Congo, using their pawns in the Congo and the UN agencies they manipulated. The armed gangs they created have begun to physically destroy the Congolese national leaders, attempting to establish a pro-Western regime of Kasavubu, Tshombe, and Mobutu in the Congo by this method.

The Soviet representative exposed the Western countries' tactics of obstructing the dispatch of a mediation committee composed of representatives of African countries to the Congo, and severely condemned the role played by UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld. Zorin pointed out that the UN Secretary-General actually maintains the interests of the colonialists and the illegal military dictatorship in the Congo. He said that the "UN forces" command and the Secretary-General himself cannot escape responsibility for the current state of affairs in the Congo. Under the direct planning of the Secretary-General and the "UN forces" command, the former colonial ruling institutions have been restored in the Congo.

Zorin demanded that Hammarskjöld be deprived of the command of the "UN forces" command in the Congo, and that representatives of countries trusted by the Congolese people and all countries concerned with expelling colonialists be in charge of the leadership of the "UN forces" command. He also demanded that urgent measures be taken to ensure a fundamental improvement in the development of the political situation in the Congo.

Zorin demanded that Belgium's interference in the internal affairs of the Republic of the Congo be immediately stopped, that all private armies be disarmed, especially the Mobutu armed bandits, that the immediate release of Congolese government head Lumumba and other government members and members of parliament be guaranteed, and that the activities of the Congolese parliament be restored.

United Arab Republic Representative Fawzi, on behalf of the delegations of India, Indonesia, Iraq, Morocco, the United Arab Republic, and other countries, put forward a proposal demanding that the United Nations take measures to restore law and order in the Congo, release all political prisoners, especially members of the central government and members of parliament, and convene parliament quickly.

Ghanaian Representative Quaison-Sackey expressed support for the proposal put forward by Fawzi.

Hungarian Representative Pode then strongly condemned the activities of the "UN forces" and Hammarskjöld.

Moroccan Representative Bousetta pointed out that Morocco cannot be a shield for the colonialists in the Congo, so Morocco decided to withdraw its troops from the Congo.

Hammarskjöld at the meeting quibbled for himself and the "UN forces" command's connivance with the Mobutu bandits.

    联合国大会上反殖民主义力量和帝国主义势力展开激烈斗争
    政委会通过亚非提案主张承认阿尔及利亚独立  佐林谴责“联合国军”在刚果为殖民统治服务
    据新华社16日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会15日结束了历时十天的关于阿尔及利亚问题的辩论。虽然支持法国进行阿尔及利亚殖民战争的美、英等西方国家竭力反对，会议以四十七票赞成、二十票反对和二十八票弃权，通过了二十四个亚非国家提出的要求承认阿尔及利亚人民的自决和独立权利的提案。
    亚非国家的提案主张“承认阿尔及利亚人民自决和独立的权利”和“承认迫切需要提供充分的和有效的保证，确保在尊重阿尔及利亚的统一和领土完整的基础上成功地和正当地行使自决权。”
    同时，亚非国家的提案认为，“联合国有责任对成功地和正当地行使这种权利作出贡献”。提案主张“在阿尔及利亚举行一次由联合国组织监督和监察的公民投票”。
    支持亚非国家提案的有亚非国家、社会主义国家和一些西欧和拉丁美洲国家。美、英、意大利等法国的北大西洋集团盟国和一些受美国控制的拉丁美洲国家投反对票。
    在14和15日两天的辩论中，美国和英国的代表发言，力图阻挠通过亚非国家的提案，再一次表明它们是亚非民族独立运动的敌人。美国代表威耳科克斯在15日的会议上攻击亚非国家的提案是“阻碍而不是帮助（阿尔及利亚）问题的解决”。
    苏联代表佐林在15日会议上宣读了塔斯社关于阿尔及利亚问题的声明。佐林重申，苏联代表团认为，有必要迅速解决阿尔及利亚问题，制止阿尔及利亚的流血事件。
    在两天会议上发言的罗马尼亚、波兰、保加利亚、匈牙利、乌克兰、阿拉伯联合共和国等国的代表，在发言中都表示支持阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的斗争。
    据新华社19日讯　纽约消息：在联合国大会17日继续讨论刚果局势的全体会议上，古巴外长罗亚在发言时指出，联合国大会通过要求结束殖民主义的宣言，这是殖民主义在道义上的巨大失败。但是帝国主义目前还有足够的力量来威胁国际和平和安全。现在刚果的局势就是一种危险。
    罗亚指出，北大西洋集团成员国在刚果的真正目的，已经清楚地暴露出来。帝国主义和殖民主义者窒息了刚果的独立。联合国安全理事会和大会的决议迎合了美帝国主义和殖民主义的利益。
    印度尼西亚代表说，在刚果的混乱局面和无法无天的行为，是帝国主义武装干涉造成的。
    阿尔巴尼亚代表迈利勒在会上着重指出，美帝国主义在反对刚果人民的阴谋中扮演着主要的角色，
  “联合国军”司令部公开勾结侵略者，因而声誉扫地。
    保加利亚代表乔巴诺夫也要求让刚果中央政府和议会恢复活动，并且解除蒙博托匪徒的武装。
    美国代表华兹沃斯在会上为美国侵略刚果的罪行狡辩。他硬说解除蒙博托集团的武装就会导致刚果“建设性力量的削弱”，说什么“任何这样的尝试都是一种侵略”。华兹沃斯在讲话中要联合国所有成员国支持美国盗用联合国名义干涉刚果的行动。
    比利时代表洛里丹在发言中表示，比利时殖民主义者坚决要赖在刚果不走。
    罗马尼亚代表米辛契斯库对美国和比利时代表的发言表示愤慨，并加以严正的驳斥。
    联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德公然要求扩大他干涉刚果的权力。他要求“加强联合国的权利”，并且别有用心地要求禁止所有联合国会员国对刚果局势的所谓“单方面的干涉”。
    据新华社17日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会全体会议16日上午重新讨论苏联提出的刚果局势问题。
    苏联代表团团长佐林在会上首先发言。他指出刚果局势的恶化，西方殖民主义者毫不知耻地利用他们在刚果的走卒以及他们操纵的联合国机构开始了执行他们在刚果的破坏政策的新阶段。他们一手建立的武装匪帮开始了对刚果民族领袖的人身摧残，妄想以这种方法在刚果建立亲西方分子——卡萨武布、冲伯和蒙博托政权。
    苏联代表揭露西方国家阻挠派遣由非洲国家代表组成的调解委员会去刚果的手法，并且严词谴责了联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德扮演的角色。佐林指出，联合国秘书长实际上维护殖民主义者的利益和刚果非法的军事独裁制度。他说，“联合国军”司令部和秘书长本人不能逃脱对目前刚果事态的责任。在秘书长和“联合国军”司令部的直接策划下，前殖民主义统治机构又在刚果恢复了。
    佐林要求剥夺哈马舍尔德对在刚果的“联合国军”司令部的指挥权，而让那些受到刚果人民和一切关心驱逐殖民主义者的国家信任的国家的代表担任“联合国军”司令部的领导工作。他还要求采取紧急措施，保证使刚果政治局势的发展根本好转。
    佐林要求立即制止比利时对刚果共和国内政的干涉，解除一切私人军队，首先是蒙博托武装匪徒的武装，保证立即释放刚果政府首脑卢蒙巴以及其他政府成员和议会议员，保证恢复刚果议会的活动。
    阿拉伯联合共和国代表法齐以印度、印度尼西亚、伊拉克、摩洛哥、阿拉伯联合共和国等国代表团的名义提出一项提案，要求联合国采取措施恢复刚果的法律和秩序，释放一切政治犯，首先是释放中央政府的成员和议会议员，迅速召开议会。
    加纳代表奎森—萨基表示支持法齐提出的提案。
    接着发言的匈牙利代表波得严词谴责“联合国军”和哈马舍尔德的活动。
    摩洛哥代表布塞塔指出，摩洛哥不能做在刚果的殖民主义者的挡箭牌，因此摩洛哥决定从刚果召回军队。
    哈马舍尔德在会上为他自己以及“联合国军”司令部纵容蒙博托匪帮狡辩。
