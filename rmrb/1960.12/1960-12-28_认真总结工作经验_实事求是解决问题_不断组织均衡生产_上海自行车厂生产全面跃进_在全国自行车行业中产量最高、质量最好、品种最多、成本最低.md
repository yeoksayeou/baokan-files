Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 27th: Having initially proposed to become the national bicycle industry leader in terms of highest output, best quality, most varieties, and lowest cost, the Shanghai Bicycle Factory has victoriously realized this overall leap forward slogan, completing its annual state plan ahead of schedule. All economic indicators have been fulfilled excellently, with a greater leap forward margin than in previous years.

As of December 18th, the factory's bicycle production had completed 100.9% of the annual plan, an increase of over 165,000 bicycles compared to last year. The "Forever" brand bicycles produced by this factory were already rated as the best in the country last year; and after the National Bicycle Professional Conference competition in August this year, they continue to lead the nation. The cost of bicycles has been reduced by more than 11% compared to last year, and the average cost of comparable products has caught up with that of the Tianjin Bicycle Factory, which has always had the lowest cost. This year, the factory has been producing seven types of products in large quantities, including standard flat bar bikes, light roadsters, high-end racing bikes, and heavy-duty bikes for rural use. Recently, they successfully trial-produced a light, dual-purpose motorized bicycle, making them the bicycle factory with the most varieties in the country. The factory's labor productivity completed 101.4% of the plan, an increase of 64.9% compared to last year; the profits delivered to the state also exceeded the national plan.

After the factory's Party committee proposed the "Four Mosts" slogan to all employees at the beginning of this year, it immediately led the masses in a serious, meticulous, and comprehensive summary of the experiences of the Great Leap Forward over the past two years, using these experiences to guide this year's production and work. In January, they launched a factory-wide summary and exchange of experience activities on five special topics, including overcoming material difficulties, carrying out technological innovation, and strengthening economic management. This activity played a positive role in solving problems in production. Since then, the Party committee has made summarizing experience an important part of the Party committee's leadership work, conducting regular production summaries monthly and quarterly, and also conducting summaries based on the central work of each period. Through such summaries, the factory's cadres and masses have become more and more confident in achieving the "Four Mosts" goal, and the measures have become more and more concrete. The factory produces both flat bar bikes and light roadsters in large quantities. The tire specifications are different, but the tire supply situation often changes this year. At the beginning of September, there were more light roadster tires supplied. When arranging the plan, they transferred some of the manpower and equipment that produced flat bar bikes to produce light roadsters. By the 25th of that month, the supply of flat bar bike tires suddenly increased. Because the factory had already mastered the experience of organizing high-yield, high-quality production in the face of variable supplies through special summaries, they were able to adapt quickly, breaking the conventional rule of "no changing varieties at the end of the month," and adjusting the manpower and equipment of each workshop to produce more flat bar bikes. As a result, the month not only completed the light roadster task, but also produced an additional three thousand standard flat bar bikes.

In the process of achieving the overall leap forward of high output, high quality, multiple varieties, and low cost, the factory tried its best to solve the major key problems that needed to be solved through self-reliance, and was able to solve the problems quickly. For example, after the bicycle output increased, the steel strips for the frame tubes, which were originally outsourced, could not always meet the needs. With the support of higher authorities and the assistance of fraternal factories, they mobilized the masses to build more than a dozen cold-pressing machines in more than two months, establishing a rolling workshop to produce steel strips themselves. This not only achieved self-sufficiency in steel strips, but also saved processing and transportation costs, ensuring high output and reducing costs. The factory's four key processes—electroplating, welding, painting, and heat treatment—were all operated manually in the past, with low production efficiency and high material consumption, which were major obstacles to achieving the "Four Mosts." They decided to adopt several measures simultaneously to quickly break through these four key areas. For example, replacing oxygen-welded tubes with resistance-welded tubes required a precision resistance-welding tube machine. A resistance machine they designed and manufactured themselves could not operate normally because some electron tubes were easily damaged. They took measures in four aspects simultaneously, including extending the life of electron tubes and preparing substitutes, and quickly solved the problem. After using this machine, welding tube efficiency increased more than tenfold, saving a lot of manpower and oxygen, improving bicycle quality, and reducing bicycle costs.

Vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution is an important factor for the Shanghai Bicycle Factory to achieve an overall leap forward. Currently, there are 3,021 innovation projects officially in use in the factory, accounting for 85% of all innovation projects this year; a total of more than 160 single-machine automated equipment and more than 20 automatic and semi-automatic production lines have emerged in the factory. Through technical innovation and technical revolution, nearly a thousand workers in the factory have been freed from heavy manual labor. The current production capacity is more than 40% higher than at the beginning of the year. Compared with 1957 before the Great Leap Forward, it is equivalent to three factories at that time. In the technical revolution movement, they created and used the formula of "Investigation-Determination—Balance—Innovation." The bicycle factory has a large output and many parts, so it is necessary to regularly investigate and determine, and balance the production capacity of each workshop. In the process of investigating and balancing production capacity, if weak links are found, vigorous technical innovation is carried out to overcome them. In this way, technical innovation is combined with overcoming weak links in production, so that production develops comprehensively, balancedly, and continuously. For example, when they conducted investigation-determination in the three main workshops, they initially found that the production capacity of the electroplating workshop lagged behind the painting and metalworking workshops and was a weak link in the factory. The Party committee mobilized the masses to improve electroplating technology, and the production capacity increased sharply by 40%. At this time, the weak link shifted to the painting workshop. This workshop then successfully tested a new rapid painting technology, and the production capacity also increased by 50%. After the capacity of the two workshops increased, the original metalworking workshop, which had the largest capacity, became a new weak link. At this time, the factory leadership saw that the metalworking workshop had more types of work and complex innovations, and it was difficult to quickly improve production capacity relying solely on the strength of this workshop, so they drew a batch of forces from various workshops and departments to help the metalworking workshop. At present, the production capacity of this workshop has also increased by 40% compared with the beginning of the year. After the three workshops have gone through cycles of investigation-determination, balance, and innovation, the production level has become higher and higher. The highest production capacity at the beginning of the year was more than 1,600 bicycles per day, and now it has reached about 2,400 bicycles.

    认真总结工作经验　实事求是解决问题　不断组织均衡生产
    上海自行车厂生产全面跃进
    在全国自行车行业中产量最高、质量最好、品种最多、成本最低
    据新华社上海27日电　年初提出要在全国自行车行业中争取做到产量最高、质量最好、品种最多、成本最低的上海自行车厂，已经胜利地实现这一全面跃进的口号，提前全面完成了今年的国家计划。各项经济指标都完成得很出色，跃进的幅度超过了往年。
    到12月18日止，这个厂的自行车产量已完成全年计划的100.9％，比去年增加了十六万五千多辆。这个厂生产的“永久牌”自行车，去年就评为全国最好的产品；今年8月份经过全国自行车专业会议的评比，仍在全国领先。自行车的成本比去年降低11％以上，可比产品的平均成本，赶上了一向成本最低的天津自行车厂。今年全厂大量生产的产品共有标定平车、轻便车、高级赛车和农村用的载重车等七种，最近又试制成功一种轻便两用机动车，因而成为目前国内品种最多的自行车工厂。全厂劳动生产率完成计划101.4％，比去年增长64.9％；上交利润也超额完成了国家计划。
    这个工厂的党委今年年初向全厂职工提出了“四最”的口号以后，立即领导群众认真细致地全面总结了过去两年大跃进的经验，用来指导今年的生产和工作。1月份，他们就以战胜材料困难、开展技术革新、加强经济管理等五个专题，展开了全厂性的总结和交流经验的活动。这一活动对解决生产中的问题，起了良好的作用。从此，党委就把总结经验工作作为党委领导工作的一个重要的组成部分，每月、每季都定期作生产总结，另外还根据每一时期的中心工作进行总结。通过这样的总结，全厂干部和群众对实现“四最”的目标，信心愈来愈高，措施愈来愈具体。这个厂的平车和轻便车是同时大量生产的，车胎规格不同，但今年车胎供应情况经常发生变化。9月初，轻便车车胎供应数量较多，他们在安排计划时，就把一部分生产平车的人力和设备，转为生产轻便车。到了这个月的25日，平车车胎的供应量忽然增多。由于全厂经过专题总结，已经掌握了在供应多变的情况下组织高产优质的经验，因此能马上随机应变，打破过去“月底不能变动品种”的常规，调整了各车间的人力和设备来多产平车。结果，这个月不仅完成了轻便车的任务，而且又多生产了三千辆标定平车。
    这个厂在实现高产、优质、多品种、低成本全面跃进的过程中，对必需解决的重大的关键问题，都尽量用自力更生的办法解决，因而能迅速解决问题。例如，自行车产量提高以后，原来委托外厂加工的车管钢带不能经常满足需要。他们就在上级的支持和兄弟工厂的协助下，发动群众在两个多月内造出了十多台冷压机，成立了一个压延车间，自己生产钢带，不但实现了钢带全部自给，而且节省了加工和运输费用，既保证了高产，又降低了成本。这个工厂的电镀、焊接、油漆、热处理四大关键性的工艺，过去全用手工操作，生产效率低，材料消耗大，是实现“四最”的大障碍。他们决定对这四大关键都同时采用几个措施，迅速加以突破。例如，用电阻焊管代替氧气焊管，需要一台精密的电阻焊管机。他们自己设计制造的一台电阻机，因为部分电子管容易损坏，不能正常运转。他们就同时从延长电子管的寿命和准备代用品等四个方面采取措施，很快解决了问题。使用这台机器以后，焊管效率提高十多倍，节约了大量人力和氧气，提高了自行车质量，自行车的成本也降低了。
    大搞技术革新和技术革命，是上海自行车厂实现全面跃进的一个重要因素。目前全厂正式使用的革新项目有三千零二十一项，占今年全部革新项目的85％；全厂共出现了一百六十多台单机自动设备，二十多条自动和半自动的生产流水线。通过技术革新和技术革命，全厂近千名工人摆脱了繁重的手工操作，目前的生产能力比年初提高40％以上，和大跃进以前的1957年相比，等于那时三个厂。他们在技术革命运动中，创造和运用了“查定——平衡——革新”这个公式。自行车厂产量大、零件繁多，必须经常查定和平衡各车间的生产能力。在查定平衡生产能力中，发现薄弱环节，就大搞技术革新来加以克服。这样就把技术革新和克服生产薄弱环节结合了起来，使生产全面、均衡、持续发展。如他们在三个主要车间中进行查定时，最初，发现电镀车间的生产能力落后于油漆、金工车间，是全厂的一个薄弱环节。党委就发动群众改进电镀技术，生产能力猛增40％。这时薄弱环节转到油漆车间。这个车间接着试验成功一种快速油漆的新技术，生产能力也提高了50％。两个车间能力提高后，原来能力最大的金工车间，反而变成一个新的薄弱环节。这时，工厂领导看到金工车间工种较多，革新复杂，单靠这个车间的力量迅速提高生产能力有困难，就从各车间、部门中抽出一批力量，帮助金工车间。目前，这个车间的生产能力也比年初时提高了40％。三个车间经过周而复始地查定、平衡、革新，生产水平越来越高，年初最高生产能力为日产一千六百多辆，现在都达到二千四百辆左右。
