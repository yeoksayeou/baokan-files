This newspaper, Nanning, December 6th: The Wangfu Commune in Cangwu County, Guangxi, found advanced factors in backward canteens, which changed the face of a batch of third-category canteens.

Wangfu Commune has a total of 181 canteens, most of which are well-run, and the commune members eat well and have enough to eat. However, a small number of canteens are not well-run because of weak leadership and incomplete basic systems. There are about 36 such canteens. In August of this year, in order to further implement the spirit of "grasping production with one hand and life with the other," the Commune Party Committee comprehensively inspected the canteen work and decided to strengthen the leadership of the third-category canteens in order to promote the balanced development of the canteen work.

The primary measure taken by the Wangfu Commune to strengthen the leadership of the third-category canteens was to transfer a group of experienced commune and brigade cadres to the third-category canteens to strengthen the leadership, with an average of one to two cadres in charge of each canteen.

After the cadres went deep into the canteens, they actively helped the canteen staff to discover advanced factors from their backward work, enthusiastically summarized and commended their good people and good deeds, in order to enhance their confidence in their work. Tuo Cenxiang, Deputy Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, discovered in the Shanshin Production Team's canteen that the cook, Mo Jiongxian, had a strong sense of responsibility and a good service attitude, and was known by the commune members as a "five-good" cadre. He seized this typical figure, commended him among all the cooks in the brigade, set up a banner, and called on everyone to learn from him. The cadres of this canteen were deeply moved and said: "Secretary Tuo attaches so much importance to our good aspects; we must run the canteen well in the future." At present, the Shanshin Team's canteen has also jumped to the first category.

Huang Shaochang, Secretary of the Shengpo Brigade Party Branch, felt after arriving at the Xinxing Production Team's canteen that although this canteen was poor in other aspects, it adhered to democratic management and financial system relatively well. He affirmed this experience and pointed out that the scope of democratic management should be expanded. Soon, this canteen democratically discussed the issue of developing the "family assets" through the representatives' meeting of the commune members and decided that the canteen management committee should be responsible for the division of labor, meet every two days, study every five days, and summarize every month. Soon, they planted 18 mu of vegetables, raised five pigs, and 57 poultry, becoming the most outstanding canteen in the brigade for developing the "family assets."

The Wangfu Commune Party Committee also adopted the method of linking the third-category canteens with the first-category canteens, organizing the managers and cooks of the third-category canteens to eat, watch, and discuss in advanced canteens, and learn various management systems, which also proved to be very effective. Since August, the commune and brigade have organized nine irregular visits, and 70% of the third-category canteens have been regularly linked with advanced canteens. Mo Naibin, Director of the Liushi Production Team's canteen in Wangfu Brigade, has visited the nearby advanced canteen - the Fumin Production Team's canteen - several times to "learn from the scriptures," humbly learning their experience in developing "family assets" and collective leadership methods. Now, all systems have been established and it has become a first-category canteen.

At present, among the original 36 "third-category canteens," 11 have been upgraded to the first-category level, and 25 are also better than before. Because the canteens are well-run, the lives of the commune members have been improved, and the enthusiasm for production has been enhanced. The 31 production teams, which have always been relatively backward in production, have caught up with the advanced teams in the autumn harvest and winter planting.

### 旺甫公社从落后事物中抓积极因素  一批三类食堂面貌更新

    旺甫公社从落后事物中抓积极因素
    一批三类食堂面貌更新
    本报南宁6日电　广西苍梧县旺甫公社在落后的食堂中找先进因素，使一批三类食堂改变了面貌。
    旺甫公社共有一百八十一个食堂，绝大部分都办得不错，社员吃得好、吃得饱。还有少数食堂由于领导力量较弱，基本制度没有完全建立，办得不够好。这类食堂约有三十六个。今年8月，公社党委为了进一步贯彻“一手抓生产，一手抓生活”的精神，全面检查了食堂工作，决定加强三类食堂的领导，以推进食堂工作平衡开展。
    旺甫公社加强三类食堂领导的首要措施，是抽调一批有经验的公社、大队干部，到三类食堂去，充实领导力量，平均每个食堂有一至二个干部包干负责。
    干部深入食堂后，积极帮助食堂工作人员从落后的工作中，发现先进因素，热情地总结与表扬他们的好人好事，以增强工作信心。公社党委副书记陀岑祥在山心生产队食堂发现炊事员莫炯贤工作责任心强，服务态度好，被社员称为“五好”干部。他就抓住这个典型人物，在全大队炊事员中进行表扬，树立旗帜，号召大家向他学习。这个食堂的干部深为感动地说：“我们有一点好的方面，陀书记就这样重视；今后一定要把食堂搞好。”目前山心小队食堂亦已跃居为第一类。
    胜坡大队党支部书记黄少昌到新兴生产队食堂后，感到这个食堂尽管其他方面较差，但民主管理和财务制度坚持得比较好，他肯定了这个经验，同时指出要把民主管理范围扩大。不久这个食堂就通过社员代表大会，民主讨论了发展“家底”问题，决定由食堂管理委员会分工负责抓，两天一碰头、五天一研究，一月一总结。很快就种上蔬菜十八亩，养猪五头，家禽五十七只，成为全大队发展家底最出色的食堂。
    旺甫公社党委还采取了三类食堂与一类食堂挂钩联系的办法，组织三类食堂的管理人员和炊事员到先进食堂吃、看、议，学习各项管理制度，这也收效很大。8月份以来由公社、大队组织的不定期参观共九次，有70％的三类食堂都与先进食堂定期挂钩联系。旺甫大队六石生产队食堂主任莫乃彬曾几次到附近的先进食堂——富民生产队食堂“取经”，虚心学习他们发展“家底”的经验，集体领导方法，现各项制度均已建立，成了一类食堂。
    目前，在原有的三十六个“三类食堂”中，有十一个提高为一类水平，有二十五个也比过去办得好了。由于食堂办好了，社员生活得到改善，生产积极性提高了。一向生产较落后的三十一个生产队，在秋收冬种中都已赶上先进队水平。
