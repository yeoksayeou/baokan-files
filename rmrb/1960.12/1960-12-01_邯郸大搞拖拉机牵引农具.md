    Give Full Play to the Efficiency of Tractors, Saving More Labor and Animal Power
    Handan Vigorously Develops Tractor-Drawn Farm Implements
    In more than two months, the city manufactured 458 tractor-drawn small five-furrow plows and more than 2,000 tractor-drawn multiple double-furrow plows. One tractor pulling two small multiple-furrow plows can plow more than 200 mu of land a day, equivalent to the work of 70 people or 140 animals for a day. All tractors in the city are now equipped with two to three tractor-drawn plows, increasing the average farmland operation rate by more than 35% and doubling the plowing efficiency.
    (People's Daily Handan, 30th) The city of Handan, Hebei Province, mobilized employees of county and commune farm implement manufacturing and repair factories and tractor stations to go deep into production teams, summarize rural tool reform experiences, and vigorously develop tractor-drawn farm implement sets. As of mid-November, in just over two months, the city manufactured 458 tractor-drawn small five-furrow plows and more than 2,000 tractor-drawn multiple double-furrow plows.
    In recent years, with strong support from the state, Handan City has 722 (combined) tractors and has reformed and created more than 20 kinds of tractor-drawn farm implements, which have multiplied the efficiency of many agricultural labor tasks. However, due to the small number and incomplete variety of tractor-drawn farm implements, they have not been fully equipped, and the average agricultural operation time of tractors in the city is only about 80%. The city's agricultural machinery department calculated an account in autumn plowing: two animals and one person can only plow three mu of land a day, while one tractor pulling two small multiple-furrow plows can plow more than 200 mu of land a day, equivalent to the workload of 70 people and more than 140 animals for a day; if all the tractors in the city are equipped with two tractor-drawn plows, they can save 100,000 animal power and more than 40,000 human power every day. In September, the Handan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China formulated a specific plan for the city to vigorously develop a complete set of tractor-drawn farm implements for plowing, harrowing, rolling, sowing, cultivating, fertilizing, insect control, and harvesting, and determined that the current main task is to mobilize the masses to concentrate their efforts on vigorously developing machine-cultivated farm implements that occupy the most labor and animal power and have the largest workload in farmland operations. The city plans to manufacture 1,600 tractor-drawn multiple-furrow plows and convert a batch of multiple tractor-drawn double-furrow plows before spring plowing next year, so that each tractor is equipped with two small multiple-furrow plows.
    In order to manufacture machine-cultivated farm implements suitable for local farming conditions in a short period of time, from the city and county to the commune, the secretaries personally took command, and leaders, technicians, and veteran workers from agricultural machinery manufacturing and repair, agricultural production, and tractor stations were recruited to form a research group for tractor-drawn farm implement sets. Through investigations and visits, forums with veteran farmers and tractor drivers, and on-site observations, they studied and transformed various new types of farmland implements created by farmers, matched them into sets, and created and transformed more than ten kinds of machine-cultivated farm implements with high efficiency and in line with local farming needs, such as tractor-drawn small five-furrow plows and multiple tractor-drawn double-furrow plows. This year, Rencheng Commune in Julu County plans to plant 170,000 mu of wheat, and it takes five processes from plowing and harrowing to building ridges to plant the wheat. They calculated that even if all 14 tractors, manpower, and animal power in the commune were mobilized, it would take more than two months to complete the plowing alone. Li Mingzi, an old driver at the commune's tractor station, and repair workers went deep into the production teams, studied improved farmland implements such as double-wheel double-furrow plows and mountain plows, and after many tests, repeatedly solicited opinions from veteran farmers and revised them, using three old double-wheel double-furrow plows to convert into one tractor-drawn small five-furrow plow, which was stable and fast when plowing. One 35-horsepower tractor pulling two small five-furrow plows plowed more than 200 mu of land in one day and night, equivalent to the workload of 140 animals and 70 laborers for a day, and the plowing efficiency was twice as high as that of a large foreign three-furrow plow, and the plowed land was flat like a mat, and the depth was more than five inches. The commune used more than ten days to convert more than ten small five-furrow plows from old double-furrow plows, and plowed more than 80,000 mu of land in half a month, enabling the commune to complete all the plowing on time and sow the seeds in a timely manner. During the autumn and winter plowing, the county increased the farmland operation rate of tractors from 70% in the past to more than 95%. At present, all 722 tractors in the city have been equipped with two to three small five-furrow plows or tractor-drawn multiple double-furrow plows. The average farmland operation rate of tractors has increased from 60% in the past to more than 95%, and the plowing efficiency has more than doubled. After completing 2.9 million mu of autumn plowing land ahead of schedule, the tractor stations of the counties and communes in the city had plowed 860,000 mu of winter plowing land by mid-November, doubling the amount compared with the same period last year.

    充分发挥拖拉机效用　节约更多的人力畜力
    邯郸大搞拖拉机牵引农具
    两个多月全市制造机引小五铧犁四百五十八部，机引多台双铧犁二千多件。一台拖拉机牵引两部小型多铧犁，一天耕地二百多亩，相当于七十个人力、一百四十多头牲口一天的工作量。全市现有拖拉机已全部配备两部到三部机引犁，平均农田作业率提高35％以上，耕地效率提高一倍以上。
    本报邯郸30日电　河北省邯郸市发动各县、社农具制修厂、拖拉机站职工深入生产队，总结农村工具改革经验，大搞拖拉机牵引农具配套。截至11月中旬，两个多月时间，全市制造出机引小五铧犁四百五十八部、机引多台双铧犁二千多件。
    几年来，邯郸市在国家大力支援下已有七百二十二台（混合台）拖拉机，改革和创制了二十多种机引农具，使许多项农业劳动生产效率成倍的提高。但是由于机引农具少、品种不齐全，还没有完全配成套，全市拖拉机的农业作业时间平均只在80％左右。这个市农业机械部门在秋耕工作中算了一笔账：两头牲口、一个人力一天只能耕三亩地，而一台拖拉机牵引两部小型多铧犁，一天就能耕二百多亩地，相当于七十个人力，一百四十多头牲口一天的工作量；全市现有的拖拉机都配备上两部机引犁，每天就能节省十万个畜力、四万多个人力。9月间，中共邯郸市委制订出了全市大搞耕、耙、压、播种、中耕、施肥、除虫和收割等一整套机引农具的具体规划，并且确定当前主要是发动群众集中力量大搞在农田作业中占用劳力、畜力最多，作业量最大的机耕农具。全市计划到明年春耕以前制造一千六百部机引多铧犁，改制一批多台机引双铧犁，使每台拖拉机都配备到两部小型多铧犁引犁。
    为了在短时间内制造出适合当地耕作条件的机耕农具，从市、县到公社，都由书记亲自挂帅，吸收农业机械制修、农业生产和拖拉机站等部门的领导干部、技术人员、老工人参加，组成拖拉机牵引农具配套研究小组。他们通过调查访问，老农、拖拉机手座谈，现场观摩等形式，将农民创造的各种新式耕地农具加以研究改造，搭配成套，创造和改制了机引小五铧犁、多台机引双铧犁等十多种效率高又切合当地耕作需要的机耕农具。巨鹿县任城镇公社今年计划种十七万亩小麦，从耕、耙到筑畦经过五道工序才能把麦耩上。他们计算了一下，全社十四台拖拉机、人力、畜力齐出动，光耕地也得两个多月才能完。这个社拖拉机站老司机李明子和修配工深入到生产队，研究了双轮双铧犁、山地犁等经过改良的耕地农具，先后经过多次试验，反复征求老农意见和修改，用三个旧双轮双铧犁改制成一部机引小五铧犁，耕起地来又稳又快，一台三十五马力的拖拉机牵引两部小五铧犁，一昼夜就耕了二百多亩地，相当于一百四十多头牲口七十个劳力一天的工作量，比大型洋三铧犁的耕地效率提高了两倍，耕过的地平展展的像一领席，深度都在五寸以上。这个社用了十来天时间，用旧双铧犁改制了十多部小五铧犁，半个月就耕了八万多亩地，使全社按时耕完了全部耕地并适时的播上了种。这个县在秋耕、冬耕中，拖拉机的农田作业率由过去的70％提高到95％以上。目前，全市七百二十二台拖拉机已全部配备上了两部到三部小五铧犁，或机引多台双铧犁。拖拉机的平均农田作业率由过去的60％提高到95％以上，耕地效率提高了一倍以上。全市各县、社拖拉机站提前完成了二百九十万亩秋耕地以后，到11月中旬，又冬耕地八十六万亩，比去年同期扩大了一倍。（附图片）
