The meeting of representatives of eighty-one Communist and Workers' Parties has concluded. This meeting is the most significant event in the international communist movement since the 1957 meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties. The great achievements of this meeting have been warmly welcomed by the people of the world, and are a heavy blow to the imperialists and reactionaries of all countries.

Through the joint efforts of the fraternal parties, this meeting formulated and unanimously adopted the Declaration and the Appeal to the Peoples of the World. The Declaration is the main document of this meeting. The Declaration reaffirms that the 1957 Declaration and the Peace Manifesto, these two creative Marxist-Leninist program documents, "remain the fighting banner and guide to action for the entire international communist movement." Based on Marxism-Leninism and the principles of the 1957 Declaration, the Declaration analyzed the world situation over the past three years, elucidated the main issues of the era, the world socialist system, war and peace, the national liberation movement, the revolutionary struggles in capitalist countries, and the international communist movement, and put forward the fighting tasks of the Communists of all countries, the international proletariat, and the people of the world who demand freedom and peace. We are deeply convinced that the documents formulated at this meeting will be important and historic in further strengthening the unity of the socialist camp and the solidarity of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries, further promoting the development of the international communist movement, and further promoting the great struggle of the people of all countries for world peace, national liberation, democratic freedom, and socialism.

In the three years since the 1957 Moscow Conference, tremendous new changes have taken place in the world situation and the international communist movement. The strength of socialism has surpassed the strength of imperialism more significantly. The economic construction and scientific and technological undertakings of the socialist countries have developed rapidly, their power has become increasingly strong, and the prestige and influence of the socialist camp in international life have grown, and are becoming the decisive factor in the development of human society. On the contrary, the world capitalist system is in a process of deep decline and disintegration. The people who are building socialism and communism, the revolutionary movement of the working class in capitalist countries, the national liberation struggles of oppressed people, and the general democratic movement, these great forces are converging into a torrent that is destroying the world imperialist system. The people of the world, especially the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, are waging a new upsurge in the struggle against imperialism and for world peace, national liberation, democratic freedom, and socialism. There is every reason to say that the formation and strengthening of the socialist world system, and the new upsurge of the national liberation movement and the emergence of a series of newly independent countries on this basis, are the two major changes with great historical significance in the fifteen years since World War II. The Declaration of the meeting correctly points out that the general crisis of capitalism has now entered a new stage, which has arisen in the context of the competition and struggle between the two world systems of socialism and capitalism, the balance of power being increasingly favorable to socialism, and the sharp exacerbation of all the contradictions of imperialism, and in the context of the victorious struggle of peace-loving forces to realize and consolidate peaceful coexistence, which has prevented the imperialists from undermining universal peace with their aggressive actions, and in the context of the upsurge of the struggle of the broad mass of people for democracy, national liberation, and socialism. This change fully demonstrates the great viability of Marxism-Leninism, and fully demonstrates that the movement for peace, national liberation, democracy, and socialism is achieving greater and greater victories.

Maintaining world peace and preventing a new world war that the imperialist aggressive blocs are plotting with utter ferocity is the most urgent task of the people of the world today. The meeting of representatives of fraternal parties studied in detail all aspects of this most pressing issue. The Declaration points out that the nature of imperialism will not change, and therefore, as long as imperialism exists, there will be soil for aggressive war. The Declaration emphasizes that the main force of aggression and war is U.S. imperialism. It is the main bastion of world reactionary forces, the international gendarme, and the enemy of the people of the world. The Declaration devotes considerable space to exposing the arms expansion and war preparations of U.S. imperialism, pointing out that it has organized various aggressive military blocs, established many military bases, and actively supports the militarist forces of West Germany and Japan, creating hotbeds of war in Europe and the East that threaten universal peace and security. The Declaration points out to the people of all countries that the danger of imperialism launching a new world war of unprecedented destructiveness has not passed, and "now more than ever, the people of all countries are required to maintain a particularly high degree of vigilance." However, the current world situation is favorable to the peace-loving people of all countries, and unfavorable to the imperialist aggressor forces. Due to the changes in the international balance of class forces, a new world war can be prevented by relying on the united struggle of the powerful forces of our time which defend the cause of peace. As the strength of socialism, the strength of the people's revolution, and the strength of peace continue to grow, this possibility is bound to become greater and greater. The Declaration points out that "the inevitability of war is not fatal." "The time has come when it is possible to restrain the imperialist aggressors from carrying out their plans for world war. The joint efforts of the world socialist camp, the international working class, the national liberation movement, all countries opposed to war, and all peace-loving forces can prevent world war."

The Declaration of the meeting points out that the realistic goals for the struggle for lasting world peace are: stopping the arms race and reducing armed forces and armaments, banning atomic weapons, abolishing foreign military bases and withdrawing foreign troops from foreign territories, preventing the revival of the militarist forces of West Germany and Japan, abolishing military blocs, etc. The Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries will unremittingly strive to achieve these goals.

The powerful forces that maintain world peace are: the powerful Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp, the peace-loving countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the international working class and its vanguard, the Communist Party, the national liberation movement of colonial and dependent countries, the world peace movement, and the neutral countries that do not agree with imperialism launching war and advocate peaceful coexistence. Bourgeois individuals in Western countries who oppose nuclear war can also join the ranks of the struggle for peace. The united struggle of all these forces is a reliable guarantee for preventing imperialism from launching a world war.

No socialist country and no Communist Party has ever believed that the victory of socialism needs to be achieved through war between countries. Therefore, socialist countries have consistently insisted on peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition with capitalist countries, and this policy has been unanimously supported by the Communists of the world and the people of the world. Socialist countries and peace-loving people all over the world will make every effort to prevent the catastrophe of a new war. However, if the imperialist warmongers insist on imposing a major war on the people of the world regardless of everything, then, as the Declaration of the meeting states, "the people of the world will cleanse and bury capitalism."

The documents of the meeting will undoubtedly play a significant mobilizing role for all Communists and all peace-loving people around the world, encouraging them to take further action with unparalleled determination and confidence to defeat the aggressive policies and war policies of the imperialist bloc headed by the United States.

The documents of the meeting pay great attention to the revolutionary storm of the national liberation movement in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. This is absolutely necessary. The national liberation movement is a great force of our time against imperialism and for maintaining world peace. The Declaration of the meeting analyzes in detail the international and domestic situations faced by all countries striving for independence and those newly independent. The Declaration strongly condemns all the tricks of the neo-colonialists of the United States, West Germany, etc., and the old colonialists of Britain, France, etc., against the national liberation movement, and resolutely supports the national liberation movements and national liberation wars of all countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The meeting called on the people of all countries to rise up and fight for the complete elimination of colonialism, and put forward to the Communists of all countries engaged in the national liberation struggle the fighting program of carrying the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary struggle to the end, thoroughly realizing the national democratic revolution, establishing national democratic countries, and striving for a non-capitalist development prospect. The Declaration points out the necessity of establishing a broad national democratic united front including the national bourgeoisie in these countries, and in view of the progressiveness and compromising nature of the national bourgeoisie, puts forward the correct policy that the working people of these countries should take on this issue. The Declaration of the meeting is not only an important symbol of the new upsurge of the national liberation movement, but will also become a huge impetus for the victory of the national democratic revolutionary struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

The Declaration of the meeting also clarified the principled stance of the Communists in the capitalist countries on the workers' movement and the struggle for socialism. The task of the Communists is to lead the working class and other working people in economic and political struggles, to oppose the monopoly capitalist groups, to achieve united action of the trade union movement in the course of various daily struggles, and to gradually make the masses of the people realize that only socialism is their true way out. Regarding the issue of peaceful and non-peaceful ways of transition from capitalism to socialism, the Declaration reaffirms the arguments of the 1957 Declaration.

Representatives of eighty-one Communist Parties with more than 36 million members participated in this meeting. The ranks of the Communist Parties of all countries have grown and strengthened in the struggle for world peace, national liberation, democratic freedom, and socialism. The Communist Parties of all countries are completely equal and independent, and at the same time, for the common interests of the communist cause, they must unite as one. The internationalist solidarity of the Communist Parties of all countries is the most important condition for winning the cause of lasting world peace, national liberation, democratic freedom, and socialism. The Declaration of the meeting points out that "concern for the continuous strengthening of the unity of the international communist movement is the highest international obligation of every Marxist-Leninist party."

In order to safeguard the international unity of their ranks based on the great Marxism-Leninism as their ideology, the Communists of all countries must resolutely oppose revisionism that deviates from Marxism-Leninism, especially Yugoslav revisionism. Revisionism remains the main dangerous trend in the international communist movement. At the same time, the dogmatic sectarian trend that deviates from reality and the masses may also become the main dangerous trend in this or that stage of development of some parties, and must also be resolutely combated.

The great socialist camp is the most active supporter of the national liberation movement and the revolutionary struggles of the people of various capitalist countries, a sincere friend of the newly independent countries, and a powerful fortress for defending world peace. Due to the series of great achievements made by socialist countries in domestic construction and international affairs over the past few years, the socialist camp is playing an increasingly decisive role in the overall process of human history. The Declaration of the meeting comprehensively discussed the basic experience of socialist countries in domestic construction, and pointed out the great significance of their fraternal cooperation and mutual assistance, especially the assistance of the Soviet Union to other fraternal countries. The countries participating in the socialist camp are truly equal and independent, and the principle of proletarian internationalism is the criterion of their mutual relations. The unity of socialist countries is the foundation of the unity of the international communist movement. The great achievements of this meeting have provided a new guarantee for the further consolidation of the unity of socialist countries.

China and the Soviet Union are the two largest countries in the socialist camp, and the CCP and the CPSU are the two largest parties in the international communist movement. The unity of the Chinese and Soviet parties and countries is of the utmost importance to the unity of the entire socialist camp and of the entire international communist moment. The great Soviet Union is not only the first socialist country in human history, but also the most advanced and powerful country in the socialist camp. The great Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the oldest and most experienced acknowledged vanguard in the international communist movement. The Declaration of the meeting correctly pointed out the leading position of the Soviet Union in the entire socialist camp and of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the entire international communist movement. The Communist Party of China has always valued the greatest role played by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people in the struggle against imperialism, in maintaining peace, and in supporting all progressive causes in the world, sincerely thanked the Soviet Union for its great assistance to the Chinese revolution and construction, and has consistently worked to maintain and strengthen the unity of the Chinese and Soviet parties and countries. Further strengthening the time-tested greatest friendship between the Chinese and Soviet parties and the people of the two countries is not only the common and greatest interest of the Chinese and Soviet people, but also the common and greatest interest of the entire socialist camp and the entire international communist movement. Precisely because of this, with the increasing strength of the forces of peace and socialism, the imperialists and reactionaries of all countries are particularly keen on conspiring by all means to undermine the close friendship between the Chinese and Soviet parties and countries. They completely do not understand that the common ideals, the common cause, and the common interests closely link the Chinese and Soviet parties and countries together, and that no force can separate them. The result of this meeting thoroughly shattered the vain hopes of the imperialist reactionaries, and once again proved that, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, "The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is eternal and unbreakable." The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people will always be with the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the great Soviet people, protecting the unity of the Chinese and Soviet parties and the people of the two countries as they protect their own eyes, and will do everything in their power to continuously strengthen this unity. What Comrade Liu Shaoqi said at the Moscow airport on November 5 was entirely correct: "No matter what the circumstances, no matter whether there are huge storms and huge difficulties in the world, people will see that the 860 million people of China and the Soviet Union are always standing together."

The results of the meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries are in line with the common aspirations of the international proletariat and the people of the world. Faced with the joint offensive of imperialism and the reactionaries, the international proletariat and the people of the world urgently hope to further coordinate common actions, strengthen unity, and strengthen the struggle. This meeting, like the 1957 meeting, proves that the method of reaching consensus through consultation is correct and effective. The Declaration of the meeting states: "The Communist and Workers' Parties hold meetings as needed to discuss pressing issues, exchange experiences, understand each other's views and positions, reach unanimous views through consultations, and coordinate common actions in the struggle to achieve common goals." Now, the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries have a declaration unanimously adopted by the meeting. This declaration, like the 1957 Declaration, will become the criterion for future joint actions and the program for strengthening unity for the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries. The strength of these documents lies in the fact that they speak of the basic truth of the present era, in the fact that they have advanced the theory of Marxism-Leninism, in the fact that they have pointed out to the international proletariat and the people of the world the path to victory, and in the fact that the tasks they have put forward will be turned into reality through the joint efforts of the Communists of all countries. The Communist Party of China will, as always, guarantee that it will abide by the agreements we have reached with the fraternal parties, and will resolutely fight to the end to realize the fighting goals stipulated in our common documents.

The signing of the new common document is the beginning of a new common struggle. In order to win the victory of the cause of world peace, in order to win the victory of the national liberation movement, and in order to win the victory of the cause of socialism, we still face serious fighting tasks. However, the current situation is favorable to us, time is favorable to us, and our future is infinitely bright. Through the struggle of the people of all countries in the world, world peace can be won, peaceful coexistence can be realized, and the victory of national liberation and socialism is unstoppable. Under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, under the banner of proletarian international ism, relying on the unity of the great socialist camp, the unity of the Communist parties of all countries in the world, the unity of the working class of the world, and the unity of the people of the world who love peace and freedom, we will surely be able to achieve new and greater victories!

    胜利的旗帜，团结的旗帜！
    有八十一个共产党参加的各国共产党和工人党代表会议结束了。这次会议是一九五七年各国共产党和工人党代表会议以后国际共产主义运动中一次最重大的事件。这次会议的巨大成就，受到了全世界人民的热烈欢迎，而对于帝国主义者和各国反动派，则是一个沉重的打击。
    这次会议经过各兄弟党的共同努力，制定了并且一致通过了声明和告世界人民书。声明是这次会议的主要文件。声明重申：一九五七年的宣言和和平宣言这两个创造性的马克思列宁主义的纲领性文件，“仍然是整个国际共产主义运动的战斗旗帜和行动指南”。声明根据马克思列宁主义和一九五七年宣言的原则，分析了三年以来的世界形势，阐明了时代的内容、世界社会主义体系、战争与和平、民族解放运动、资本主义国家的革命斗争、国际共产主义运动等方面的主要问题，提出了各国共产党人、国际无产阶级、全世界要求自由和和平的人民的战斗任务。我们深信，这次会议制定的文件，对于进一步加强社会主义阵营的团结和全世界各国共产党和工人党的团结，对于进一步促进国际共产主义运动发展，对于进一步促进各国人民为世界和平、民族解放、民主自由和社会主义的伟大斗争，都具有重大的历史意义。
    从一九五七年莫斯科会议以来的整整三年中，世界形势和国际共产主义运动发生了巨大的新变化。社会主义的力量更加显著地超过了帝国主义的力量。社会主义各国的经济建设和科学技术事业迅速发展，威力日益强大，社会主义阵营在国际生活中的威信和影响日益增长，正在成为人类社会发展的决定性因素。相反，世界资本主义体系却处在一个深刻的衰落和瓦解的过程中。正在建设社会主义和共产主义的人民，资本主义国家工人阶级的革命运动，被压迫人民的民族解放斗争，一般民主运动，这些伟大力量正在汇合成为摧毁世界帝国主义体系的洪流。世界各国人民，首先是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民，反对帝国主义、争取世界和平、民族解放、民主自由和社会主义的斗争，出现了一个新的高涨。完全有理由说，社会主义世界体系的形成和壮大，民族解放运动的新高涨和在这个基础上一系列新独立国家的出现，这是第二次世界大战以后十五年来具有伟大历史意义的两大变化。会议的声明正确地指出，资本主义总危机在目前时期已经进到了一个新的阶段，这是在社会主义和资本主义这两个世界体系的竞赛和斗争、力量对比越来越有利于社会主义、帝国主义的一切矛盾急剧尖锐化的情况下产生的，是在爱好和平力量实现和巩固和平共处的胜利斗争使帝国主义者未能以其侵略行动破坏普遍和平的条件下产生的，是在广大人民群众争取民主、民族解放和社会主义的斗争高涨的情况下产生的。这个变化，充分说明了马克思列宁主义的伟大的生命力，充分说明了和平、民族解放、民主和社会主义的运动正在取得愈来愈大的胜利。
    维护世界和平，防止帝国主义侵略集团所穷凶极恶地策划着的新世界战争，是当前全世界人民的最迫切的任务。各国兄弟党代表会议详细地研究了这个最迫切问题的各个方面。声明指出，帝国主义的本性是不会改变的，因而只要帝国主义还存在，就有侵略战争的土壤。声明着重指出，侵略和战争的主要力量是美帝国主义。它是世界反动势力的主要堡垒，是国际宪兵，是全世界人民的敌人。声明以大量篇幅揭露美帝国主义的扩军备战活动，指出它组织了各个侵略性的军事集团，建立了许多军事基地，并且积极扶植西德和日本的军国主义势力，在欧洲和东方造成了威胁普遍和平与安全的战争策源地。声明向各国人民指明，帝国主义发动新的具有空前破坏性的世界大战的危险还没有过去，“现在比任何时候都更要求各国人民保持特别高的警惕”。但是，目前的世界形势有利于争取和平的各国人民，而不利于帝国主义侵略势力。由于国际阶级力量对比的变化，依靠当代维护和平事业的强大力量的联合斗争，新的世界战争是可以防止的。随着社会主义力量、人民革命力量和和平力量的不断增长，这种可能性必然越来越大。声明指出，“战争的注定不可避免性是不存在的”。“能够制止帝国主义侵略者实现他们的世界战争计划的时候已经到来。世界社会主义阵营、国际工人阶级、民族解放运动、所有反对战争的国家以及一切爱好和平力量的联合努力能够防止世界战争。”
    会议的声明指出了为世界持久和平而斗争的现实的目标是：停止军备竞赛和裁减武装部队和军备，禁止原子武器，取消外国军事基地和从外国领土上撤退外国军队，制止复活西德和日本的军国主义势力，取消军事集团，等等。各国共产党和工人党将为实现这些目标而坚持不懈地奋斗。
    维护世界和平的强大力量是：强大的苏联和整个社会主义阵营，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲爱好和平的国家，国际工人阶级及其先锋队共产党，殖民地和附属国的民族解放运动，世界和平运动，不同意帝国主义发动战争和主张和平共处的中立国家。西方国家中反对核战争的资产阶级人士，也可以参加争取和平的行列。所有这些力量的联合斗争，是防止帝国主义发动世界战争的可靠保证。
    任何社会主义国家和任何共产党从来不认为，社会主义的胜利需要通过国与国之间的战争来实现。因此，社会主义国家一贯坚持同资本主义国家实行和平共处和和平竞赛，这个政策受到全世界共产党和全世界人民的一致支持。社会主义国家和全世界爱好和平的人民将作一切努力来防止新战争的灾难。但是，如果帝国主义战争狂人硬要不顾一切地把大战强加在世界人民头上，那末，正如会议声明所说的，“世界人民将清除和埋葬资本主义”。
    会议的文件，对于全世界一切共产党人和一切爱好和平的人民，毫无疑问将发挥重大的动员作用，鼓舞他们以无比的决心和信心，进一步行动起来，击败以美国为首的帝国主义集团的侵略政策和战争政策。
    会议的文件对于亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族解放运动的革命风暴给了巨大的注意。这是完全必要的。民族解放运动是当代反对帝国主义和维护世界和平的伟大力量。会议的声明详细分析了一切争取独立和新得到独立的国家所面临的国际和国内的形势。声明强烈谴责美国、西德等新殖民主义者和英、法等老殖民主义者的一切反对民族解放运动的伎俩，坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国民族解放运动和民族解放战争。会议号召各国人民起来为彻底消灭殖民主义而斗争，并且向进行民族解放斗争的各国共产党人提出了把反帝反封建的革命斗争进行到底，彻底实现民族民主革命的斗争纲领，建立民族民主国家和争取非资本主义发展前途的战斗任务。声明指出了在这些国家建立广泛的包括民族资产阶级在内的民族民主统一战线的必要，并且针对民族资产阶级的进步性和妥协性，提出了这些国家的劳动人民在这个问题上应取的正确的方针。会议的声明，不但是民族解放运动新高涨的重要标志，而且必将成为亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民争取民族民主革命斗争胜利的巨大动力。
    会议的声明也阐明了共产党人在资本主义国家中对工人运动和争取社会主义的斗争的原则立场。共产党人的任务是领导工人阶级和其他劳动人民进行经济斗争和政治斗争，反对垄断资本集团，在各种日常斗争的过程中实现工会运动的统一行动，并且使人民群众逐步认识到只有社会主义才是他们的真正出路。关于从资本主义向社会主义过渡的和平方式和非和平方式问题，声明重申了一九五七年宣言的论点。
    参加这次会议的有拥有三千六百多万党员的八十一个共产党的代表。各国共产党的队伍在为世界和平、民族解放、民主自由和社会主义的斗争中成长和壮大了。各国共产党是完全平等的，独立自主的，同时，它们为了共产主义事业的共同利益，必须团结一致。各国共产党的国际主义团结，是争取世界持久和平、民族解放、民主自由和社会主义事业胜利的最重要的条件。会议的声明指出，“关心不断加强国际共产主义运动的团结，是每个马克思列宁主义政党的最高的国际义务。”
    各国共产党人为了维护自己队伍的以伟大的马克思列宁主义为思想基础的国际团结，必须坚决反对背离马克思列宁主义的修正主义，特别是南斯拉夫修正主义。修正主义仍然是国际共产主义运动中的主要危险倾向。同时，脱离实际、脱离群众的教条主义宗派主义倾向，在某些党的这一或那一发展阶段上，也可能成为主要的危险倾向，也必须同它们进行坚决的斗争。
    伟大的社会主义阵营，是民族解放运动和资本主义各国人民革命斗争的最积极的支持者，是新独立国家的真诚的朋友，是保卫世界和平的强大堡垒。由于几年来社会主义各国在国内建设和国际事务中取得一系列的巨大成就，社会主义阵营对人类历史发展的总进程正起着越来越大的决定性的影响。会议的声明概括地论述了社会主义各国在国内建设中的基本经验，并且指出了他们相互之间的兄弟般的合作和相互援助特别是苏联对其他兄弟国家的援助的重大意义。参加社会主义阵营的各国是真正平等和独立自主的，它们之间的相互关系的准则是无产阶级国际主义的原则。社会主义各国的团结是国际共产主义运动团结的基础。这次会议的巨大成就，使社会主义各国团结的进一步巩固得到了新的保证。
    中国和苏联是社会主义阵营两个最大的国家，中共和苏共是国际共产主义运动中两个最大的党。中苏两党两国的团结一致，对于整个社会主义阵营和整个国际共产主义运动团结一致，具有最重要的意义。伟大的苏联不但是人类历史上第一个社会主义国家，而且是社会主义阵营中最先进、最强大的国家。伟大的苏联共产党是国际共产主义运动中历史最久、经验最丰富的公认的先锋队。会议的声明正确地指出了苏联在整个社会主义阵营中和苏联共产党在整个国际共产主义运动中的首要地位。中国共产党一贯重视苏联共产党和苏联人民在反对帝国主义的斗争中、在维护和平和支持全世界一切进步事业的活动中所起的最大的作用，衷心感谢苏联对中国革命和建设事业的巨大援助，并且一贯地为维护和加强中苏两党两国的团结而努力。进一步加强中苏两党和两国人民间久经考验的最伟大的友谊，不仅是中苏两国人民的共同的最大利益，而且也是整个社会主义阵营和整个国际共产主义运动的共同的最大利益。正因为这样，随着和平和社会主义的力量的日益强大，帝国主义者和各国反动派特别热中于千方百计地阴谋破坏中苏两党两国间的亲密友谊。他们完全不了解，共同的理想、共同的事业和共同的利益把中苏两党和两国紧紧地联结在一起，没有任何力量可以使它们分离。这次会议的结果，彻底粉碎了帝国主义反动派的妄想，又一次证明，如毛泽东同志所说，“中苏两国人民的友谊是永恒的，牢不可破的”。中国共产党和中国人民，将永远同伟大的苏联共产党和伟大的苏联人民在一起，像保护自己的眼珠一样保护中苏两党和两国人民的团结，并将为不断加强这种团结而竭尽自己一切的努力。刘少奇同志十一月五日在莫斯科机场的演说说得完全对：“不论在什么情况下，不论世界上是否发生巨大的风波和巨大的困难，人们都会看到，中苏两国八亿六千万人民总是站在一起的。”
    各国共产党和工人党会议的结果，是符合国际无产阶级和全世界人民的共同愿望的。国际无产阶级和全世界人民面对着帝国主义和反动派的联合进攻，迫切地希望进一步协调共同的行动，加强团结，加强斗争。这次会议同一九五七年的会议一样，证明通过协商得到一致意见的方法是正确和有效的。会议的声明说：“共产党和工人党根据需要举行会议来讨论迫切的问题，交流经验，互相了解彼此的观点和立场，通过协商途径得到一致的观点，协调在争取共同目标的斗争中的共同行动。”现在，在各国共产党和工人党面前已经有了一个为会议一致通过的声明。这个声明将同一九五七年的宣言一样，成为各国共产党和工人党今后共同行动的准则和加强团结的纲领。这些文件的力量在于它们所说的是现时代的基本真理，在于它们向前发展了马克思列宁主义的理论，在于它们为国际无产阶级和全世界人民指出了达到胜利的途径，在于它们所提出的任务将经过各国共产党人的共同努力而变成现实。中国共产党将一如既往，保证遵循我们同各兄弟党一致达成的协议，并将坚决地为实现我们的共同文件所规定的斗争目标而奋斗到底。
    新的共同文件的签署，是新的共同斗争的开始。为了争取世界和平事业的胜利，为了民族解放运动的胜利，为了社会主义事业的胜利，我们还面临着严重的战斗任务。但是，当前的形势有利于我们，时间有利于我们，我们的前途是无限光明的。通过世界各国人民的斗争，世界和平是可以赢得的，和平共处是可以实现的，民族解放和社会主义的胜利是不可阻挡的。在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下，在无产阶级国际主义的旗帜下，依靠伟大的社会主义阵营的团结、全世界各国共产党的团结、全世界工人阶级的团结、全世界爱好和平和自由的人民的团结，我们一定能够取得新的更加伟大的胜利！
