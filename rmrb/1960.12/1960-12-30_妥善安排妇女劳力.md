    Properly Arrange Women's Labor Force
    According to recent letters from readers in various places, many local leaders, while implementing a balance between work and rest in the people's communes, have paid attention to the physiological characteristics of female commune members, providing them with necessary care and ensuring they have sufficient rest and sleep. At the same time, while ensuring that commune members do a good job in collective production, it is very necessary to appropriately take care of female commune members' partial household chores and sideline production.
    Women in our country are a vital force in building socialism. Especially in rural areas, almost all women with labor power participate in production. Field management of various crops, pig raising and fertilizer accumulation, and canteen work cannot be separated from women. All rural women have greatly improved their political awareness, are full of energy, and have made great contributions to building a better socialist countryside and consolidating and developing the people's communes. However, precisely because the masses of women are highly motivated, we should pay more attention to the balance between work and rest for female commune members.
    Caring about the balance between work and rest for female commune members is consistent with caring about the livelihood issues of all commune members. Only by caring about commune members' thoughts, lives, eating, clothing, rest and all other practical issues in life can we fully unleash everyone's enthusiasm for production; only then can male and female commune members always maintain vigorous energy. Therefore, earnestly implementing the combination of work and rest is an active measure to ensure the sustained leap forward in socialist construction.

    妥善安排妇女劳力
    根据最近各地读者来信反映，不少地方的领导干部，在人民公社中实行劳逸结合的同时，已注意到妇女社员的生理特点，给以必要的照顾，保证她们有足够的休息和睡眠时间。同时，在保证社员搞好集体生产的前提下，适当照顾女社员的部分家务琐事和副业生产，这是十分必要的。
    我国的妇女，是建设社会主义的生力军，尤其在农村，几乎所有有劳动力的妇女，都参加了生产。各种作物的田间管理、养猪积肥、食堂工作等，都离不了妇女。所有的农村妇女，政治觉悟大大提高，干劲冲天，为把社会主义农村建设的更好，为人民公社的巩固和发展，作出了巨大贡献。但是，正因为妇女群众干劲高，我们就更应该关心妇女社员的劳逸结合。
    关心女社员的劳逸结合，和关心全公社社员的生活问题是一致的。只有关心社员的思想、生活、吃饭、穿衣、休息等一切生活实际问题，才能充分发挥每个人的生产积极性；才可以使男女社员始终保持旺盛的干劲。所以，认真实行劳逸结合，是保证社会主义建设持续跃进的一种积极的措施。
