Xinhua News Agency, Havana, December 6th. The Cuban newspaper "Hoy" published a long editorial on its front page today, praising the economic cooperation agreements recently signed between Cuba and China and the 1961 trade protocol. The editorial stated that the signing of these agreements is a huge support for Cuba's position, a great achievement of the revolutionary government in implementing its policy of establishing relations with all countries in the world and rapidly developing its economy, and a noble example of the brotherly cooperation and assistance adopted by the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and all other socialist countries towards underdeveloped countries.

The editorial described in detail the main contents of the agreements signed between the two countries. It said, "Simply describing the content of these agreements shows their benefits to Cuba, shows the support for Cuba in its struggle against the imperialist economic blockade and the counter-revolutionaries' efforts to paralyze the economy, and shows the great significance of these agreements as an example of the relationship between socialist countries and Latin American countries and all peoples struggling to regain national sovereignty and strive for independence."

The newspaper pointed out, "The myth that Cuba cannot survive economically without the United States has gone bankrupt. After the United States formally announced economic sabotage and boycott against Cuba, Cuba can not only survive economically, but also live better than before."

The editorial pointed out, "This shows that if Latin American countries regain and fully exercise their sovereignty, if they implement land reform, pursue an independent foreign policy, and establish trade relations with the whole world, then they can still maintain and develop their economies even in the face of US boycotts and blockades."

The editorial said, "This situation is possible because of the existence, strength, and economic power of the socialist camp."

The editorial added, "The revolutionary government has in the past strived to maintain normal relations with the United States, the basis of which is of course Cuba's complete national sovereignty, equality, non-interference, and mutual respect between the two countries. However, the Eisenhower imperialist government was unwilling to do so. It wanted to restore imperialist rule in Cuba."

On December 4, "Hoy" published the full text of the joint communique issued by Li Xiannian, Vice Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, and Major Guevara, head of the economic delegation of the Cuban Revolutionary Government, on the second page.

Núñez Jiménez, Director of the National Land Reform Committee of Cuba, spoke about the above-mentioned agreements signed between Cuba and China at a rally of Spaniards living in Cuba in support of the Havana Declaration on the 3rd. He said, "It is the first time in the world that one country provides another country with a loan of 60 million US dollars without any interest."

    古巴“今日报”欢迎中古两国合作的新发展
    中古经济协定是对古巴的巨大支持
    美国的封锁和抵制决不能阻挠古巴经济的发展
    新华社哈瓦那6日电　古巴《今日报》今天在第一版上发表了长篇社论，赞扬古巴同中国最近签订的经济合作协定和1961年贸易议定书。社论说，这些协定的签订是对古巴立场的巨大支援，是革命政府执行同世界各国建立关系和迅速发展经济的政策取得的巨大成就，是中华人民共和国以及苏联和其他所有的社会主义国家对不发达国家所采取的兄弟般的合作和帮助的态度的崇高范例。
    社论详细叙述了两国签订的协定的主要内容，它说，“仅仅叙述一下这些协定的内容就表明了它们对古巴的好处，表明了对古巴在反对帝国主义的经济封锁和反革命分子竭力使经济瘫痪的斗争中的支持，表明了这些协定作为社会主义国家同拉丁美洲国家及一切为收回民族主权和争取独立而斗争的人民的关系的榜样而具有的巨大意义。”
    报纸指出，“没有美国古巴在经济上就不能生存的神话已经破产了。在美国正式宣布对古巴实行经济破坏和抵制之后，古巴在经济上不仅能够生存，而且比以前生活得更好了。”
    社论指出，“这就表明，拉丁美洲国家如果收回和充分行使它们的主权，如果实行土地改革、执行独立的对外政策并且同全世界建立贸易关系，那末它们即使面临美国的抵制和封锁，也仍然能够保持和发展它们的经济。”
    社论说，“这种情况之所以可能，是由于社会主义阵营的存在、它的力量和经济威力”。
    社论又说，“革命政府过去努力同美国保持正常的关系，这种关系的基础当然是古巴完整的民族主权、平等、不干涉和两国间的互相尊重。但是，艾森豪威尔的帝国主义政府不愿意这样做。它想在古巴恢复帝国主义统治。”
    4日的《今日报》在第二版上登载了中华人民共和国国务院副总理李先念和古巴革命政府经济代表团团长格瓦拉少校发表的联合公报的全文。
    古巴土地改革全国委员会主任努涅斯·希门尼斯3日在住在古巴的西班牙人支持哈瓦那宣言的集会上谈到古巴同中国签订的上述协定。他说，“一个国家向另一个国家提供六千万美元的贷款而不要任何利息，这在世界上还是第一次。”
