    Under the People's Determined Struggle,
    Japanese Government Forced to Postpone the Establishment of Missile Base
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: News from Tokyo: The Japanese people's struggle against the government's establishment of a missile base on Niijima has achieved preliminary results. The Japanese government's "Defense Agency" has been forced to decide to postpone the time for establishing the missile base.
    According to a report in the *Tokyo Shimbun* on November 30, the Japanese "Defense Agency" originally planned to forcibly start construction of the missile base on November 25. However, the farmers of Niijima, disregarding police obstruction, held protest rallies and demonstrations for days, and blocked the roads leading to the planned missile base site. Organizations such as the Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan also dispatched strong support teams to Niijima to support the Niijima people's just struggle to defend their homes and oppose military bases. Therefore, the construction of the missile base has not been able to begin.

    在人民坚决斗争下
    日本政府被迫推迟建立导弹基地时间
    新华社讯　东京消息：日本人民反对政府在新岛建立导弹基地的斗争已经取得初步成果，日本政府“防卫厅”被迫决定推迟建立导弹基地的时间。
    据《东京新闻》11月30日报道，日本“防卫厅”原来打算在11月25日就强行动工建立导弹基地。但是，新岛的农民们不顾警察的阻挠，连日举行抗议大会和示威，并且封锁了通往预定建立导弹基地地方的道路，日本共产党、社会党、日本工会总评议会等组织还派遣了强有力的支援队到新岛，支持新岛人民保卫家园、反对军事基地的正义斗争。因而，导弹基地的建设工程一直未能开始。
