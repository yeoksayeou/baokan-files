Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, December 1st: Workers on all production fronts at Anshan Iron and Steel are making full ideological and material preparations, adopting effective technical and management measures, and are determined to go all out in December with the spirit of a ten-thousand-meter race, striving for first place, and seizing the final victory in steel production.

The workers in the raw materials production system, which is the first process of production, in order to go all out in December, have been carefully maintaining and repairing mechanical equipment such as electric shovels, crushers, ball mills, and sintering machines since mid-November, giving each piece of equipment a new look. According to incomplete statistics from Dagushan, Yingtaoyuan, and the Sintering General Plant, more than 2,000 equipment hidden dangers and missing parts have been eliminated and repaired. The No. 2 Sintering Workshop of the Sintering General Plant, in order to ensure the normal operation of blast furnace production, took the initiative to send a visiting group composed of workshop cadres, technicians, and sintering machine team leaders to the iron smelting plant to listen to opinions. After discovering that there was too much sintering ore powder, they immediately went back and mobilized the workers to check, appraise, and find the cause, and adopted twelve measures such as thick paving, leveling, and thorough sintering, so that the sintering ore particles smaller than 5 mm quickly dropped from 15% to 9%. The raw material production workers of Dagushan Iron Mine expressed their determination to achieve high output from the harsh winter, ensuring that the daily output levels of ore, concentrate, and overburden removal will be comprehensively improved in December, so that the blast furnace can eat its fill and eat well.

The workers in the transportation system are even more ambitious. Recently, they have inspected, appraised, and repaired various locomotives, power machinery, loading and unloading equipment, and more than 9,000 pieces of various thawing and anti-freezing tools for rush loading and unloading. The Northern, Southern, and Western Machinery Repair Plants have also rushed to manufacture spare parts for important equipment such as charging machine rods, blast furnace bells, slag pots, iron pots, and steel pot ears for the steelmaking and iron smelting plants. Wang Chonglun, deputy director of the tool workshop of the Northern Machinery Repair Plant, and a three-in-one group composed of more than ten workers, cadres, and technicians, went to the three major steel plants to help repair machine tools, and manufactured 1,500 cutting tools for the three major steel plants for rapid small repairs of open hearth furnaces.

The workers of the three major steelmaking plants and iron smelting plants, from workshops and work sections to teams and groups, put forward suggestions and ideas for the final thirty-one-day battle as early as mid-November. The three major steelmaking plants and iron smelting plants have already implemented 2,200 different measures in advance in terms of equipment, management, and anti-freezing. On the basis of shortening the furnace time, accurate molten ash, and good slag making, the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant further summarized the experience of rapid furnace smelting in the No. 15 open hearth furnace. This open hearth furnace only took five hours and forty minutes to smelt a furnace, and if all the open hearth furnaces in the plant reached or approached the furnace smelting level of the No. 15 open hearth furnace, the open hearth furnace operation rate could be increased by at least 3%, which is of great significance for ensuring the completion of the steel production plan in December. On November 28, 300,000 heroic sons and daughters of the steel capital held a swearing-in competition, and the representatives of various factories and mines who attended the meeting expressed that they must do a good job in cooperation in all aspects and seize the final victory in steel production.

    为大干十二月作好充分思想准备和物质准备
    鞍钢职工决心夺取最后胜利
    新华社鞍山1日电　鞍钢各个生产战线上的职工作好充分的思想准备和物质准备，采取有效技术措施和管理措施，决心以万米赛跑，力争第一的劲头，大干12月，夺取钢铁生产的最后胜利。
    处于生产第一道工序的原料生产系统的职工，为了大干12月，早在11月中旬对电铲、破碎机、球磨机和烧结机等机械设备，进行了认真维护检修，使台台设备面貌一新。据大孤山、樱桃园、烧结总厂三个单位不完全统计，已经消除和修好二千多项设备隐患和缺件。烧结总厂二烧车间为了保证高炉生产正常运行，主动派出由车间干部、技术员和烧结机组长组成的访问小组，到炼铁厂访问，听取意见。他们发现烧结矿粉末多的情况后，立即回去发动职工检查，鉴定，找出原因，并且采取了厚铺、铺平、烧透等十二项措施，使小于五公厘的烧结矿粒由15％迅速下降到9％。大孤山铁矿原料生产职工表示一定要向严冬要高产，保证12月份矿石、精矿和剥岩日产水平全面提高，让高炉吃得饱、吃得好。
    运输系统的职工更是雄心勃勃。近来，他们对各种机车、动力机械、装卸设备，和九千多件抢装抢卸的各种解冻、防冻工具，进行了检查、鉴定、检修。北部、南部和西部机修厂，也为炼钢厂、炼铁厂赶制了装料机挑杆、高炉料钟、渣罐、铁罐和钢罐耳子等重要设备的备品。北部机修厂工具车间副主任王崇伦，和十多名工人、干部、技术员组成三结合小组，奔赴三大钢厂帮助修理机床，并且制造了一千五百把刀具，给三大钢厂作为平炉快速小修之用。
    三大炼钢厂和炼铁厂职工，从车间、工段，直至班组，早在11月中旬，就为决战最后三十一天出策献计。三大炼钢厂和炼铁厂，已经提前实现设备、管理和防冻方面的两千二百项不同措施。第二炼钢厂在炼炉时间缩短、熔毕灰准确、造渣好的良好基础上，进一步总结了十五号平炉快速炼炉的经验。这座平炉仅用五点四十分钟就炼好一次炉，如果全厂各座平炉都达到或接近十五号平炉炼炉水平，平炉作业率最少可提高3％，对保证完成12月份产钢计划有重要意义。11月28日，钢都三十万英雄儿女举行誓师比武大会，到会的各厂矿代表表示，一定要从各方面搞好协作，夺取钢铁生产最后胜利。
