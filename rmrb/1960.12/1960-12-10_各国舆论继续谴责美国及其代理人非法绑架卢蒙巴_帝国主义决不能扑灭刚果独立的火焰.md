Xinhua News Agency, December 8th: International public opinion continues to severely condemn the crime of the US imperialism and its agent, the Mobutu rebel group, for illegally kidnapping Patrice Lumumba, the Prime Minister of the legitimate government of the Congo, pointing out that the US imperialism and the United Nations under its control bear the primary responsibility for undermining the independence and freedom of the Congo.

The Mongolian newspaper "Unen" published a commentary on the 8th, saying that imperialism, headed by the United States, is using its henchman—Mobutu, the enemy of the Congolese people—to achieve its goal of eliminating the Republic of the Congo. The arrest of Lumumba, the Prime Minister of the legitimate government of the Congo, by the henchmen of imperialism once again proves that imperialist colonialists are attempting to strangle Congolese independence. The Mongolian people, together with all progressive mankind, solemnly demand an immediate end to this barbaric act and the immediate release of Prime Minister Lumumba.

The Vietnamese newspaper "Nhan Dan" published a commentary on the 7th entitled "No Force Can Extinguish the Flames of the Congolese People's Struggle." When talking about the torture of Patrice Lumumba, the Prime Minister of the legitimate government of the Congo, by the Mobutu rebels, it said, "This is just a new step in the long-standing conspiracy of US and Belgian imperialism, which aims to overthrow the legitimate government of the Republic of the Congo and extinguish the flames of the Congolese people's struggle for genuine independence."

The commentary pointed out that the United Nations military command bears major responsibility for Mobutu's arrest of Prime Minister Lumumba, and said, "Imperialism and its lackeys can arrest a person, but they cannot extinguish the powerful movement of a nation. The Congolese people have awakened, and the African people have also awakened. Despite the rampant behavior of imperialism and its lackeys in the Congo, they will surely suffer a miserable defeat, and the Congolese people will surely achieve final victory."

The "Evening News," the organ of the ruling People's Convention Party of Ghana, pointed out in an editorial on the 7th that Prime Minister Lumumba's life is under threat. The United States, Belgium, Britain, and France have already made themselves very unpopular in the Congo. Their so-called "civilization" has gone bankrupt. This "civilization" only speaks well and does bad things when it suits the economic interests of Wall Street capitalists.

The Lebanese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee sent a telegram to the President of the United Nations General Assembly, strongly protesting the illegal arrest of Prime Minister Lumumba and the cruel treatment he is receiving.

The telegram demanded the release of Lumumba and pointed out that the United Nations is responsible for Lumumba's safety and for respecting the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the Congo.

The Iraqi newspaper "Al-Tahrir" published a commentary on the 7th, saying that the evil interference in the Congo by imperialism to undermine the independence and unity of the Congo has fueled Mobutu's further terrorist actions, using shameless means to arrest Prime Minister Lumumba and brutally torture him. People of all countries have expressed deep indignation and severe condemnation for this.

The newspaper pointed out that the Congolese people are currently suffering due to the interference in the internal affairs of the Congo by the US and Belgian imperialists and members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, with the full knowledge of the United Nations. The newspaper demanded the release of Lumumba.

The newspaper pointed out that the continued development of the situation in the Congo may have extremely serious consequences, and this situation will also prompt imperialists to continue to interfere in the internal affairs of newly independent countries.

The "Indonesian News" on the 8th strongly condemned the actions of the "United Nations forces" command in the Congo in assisting the colonialists. The editorial said that the "United Nations forces" not only did not help the legitimate government of the Republic of the Congo, but instead supported its enemies.

The Italian newspaper "L'Unità" published an editorial pointing out that the US Embassy in Léopoldville is a center for plotting vicious conspiracies. Hammarskjöld and Bunch openly serve the conspiracies of the United States and Belgium. Lumumba is in danger of being killed with the consent of the United Nations. And this is what Hammarskjöld calls a "policy of non-interference."

    各国舆论继续谴责美国及其代理人非法绑架卢蒙巴
    帝国主义决不能扑灭刚果独立的火焰
    据新华社8日讯　各国舆论继续严厉谴责美帝国主义及其代理人蒙博托叛乱集团非法绑架刚果合法政府总理卢蒙巴的罪行，指出美帝国主义以及在它操纵下的联合国应对破坏刚果独立和自由负主要责任。
    蒙古《真理报》8日发表的评论说，以美国为首的帝国主义正在利用它的走卒——刚果人民的敌人蒙博托来达到自己的消灭刚果共和国目的。帝国主义的走卒逮捕刚果合法政府总理卢蒙巴这件事再次证明，帝国主义殖民主义者正在企图扼杀刚果独立。蒙古人民同全体进步人类一道，严正要求立即停止这种野蛮活动，立即释放刚果总理卢蒙巴。
    越南《人民报》7日以《任何势力都不能扑灭刚果人民的斗争火焰》为题发表的评论，在谈到刚果共和国合法政府总理卢蒙巴遭到蒙博托叛乱分子的折磨时说，“这只不过是美国和比利时帝国主义长期来的阴谋的一个新步骤而已，其目的是企图推翻刚果共和国的合法政府，扑灭刚果人民争取真正独立的斗争火焰。”
    评论在指出联合国军指挥部应对蒙博托逮捕卢蒙巴总理负重大责任后说，“帝国主义及其走狗们可以逮捕一个人，但是它们却不能扑灭一个民族的强大的运动。刚果人民已经觉醒了，非洲人民也已经觉醒了。尽管帝国主义及其走狗在刚果表现得如此猖獗，但是他们一定会遭到惨败，刚果人民一定会取得最后的胜利。”
    加纳执政党人民大会党机关报《新闻晚报》7日在社论中指出，卢蒙巴总理的生命正遭受威胁。美国、比利时、英国和法国已经在刚果把自己搞得很臭，它们宣称的所谓“文明”已经破产，这种“文明”只是在适合华尔街资本家的经济利益的时候讲好话、干坏事。
    黎巴嫩亚非团结委员会打电报给联合国大会主席，强烈抗议非法逮捕卢蒙巴总理以及对他的残酷待遇。
    电报要求释放卢蒙巴，并且指出，联合国对于卢蒙巴的生命安全以及刚果独立、主权和领土完整的受尊重负有责任。
    伊拉克《斗争报》7日发表评论说，帝国主义为了破坏刚果的独立和统一而对刚果进行的罪恶干涉，助长了蒙博托进一步采取恐怖行动，以无耻的手段逮捕卢蒙巴总理并野蛮地折磨他。对此，各国人民都表示深为愤慨，并提出了严厉的谴责。
    这家报纸指出，刚果人民目前由于美国和比利时帝国主义者以及北大西洋公约组织成员国在联合国完全知道的情况下干涉刚果的内政而受苦。这家报纸要求释放卢蒙巴。
    报纸指出，刚果局势的继续发展可能造成极其严重的后果，这种情况也将促使帝国主义者继续干涉最近获得独立的国家的内政。
    《印度尼西亚新闻》8日强烈谴责在刚果的“联合国军”司令部帮助殖民主义者的行为。社论说，“联合国军”不仅没有帮助刚果共和国合法政府，相反地支持它的敌人。
    意大利《团结报》发表社论指出，美国驻利奥波德维尔大使馆是一个策划毒辣阴谋的中心。哈马舍尔德和本奇公开为美国和比利时的阴谋效劳。卢蒙巴有在联合国同意下被杀害的危险。而这就是哈马舍尔德所谓的“不干涉政策”。
