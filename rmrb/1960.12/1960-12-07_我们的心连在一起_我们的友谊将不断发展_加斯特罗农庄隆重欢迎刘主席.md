Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, and head of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation, visited the Castro Collective Farm near Minsk this afternoon, and was warmly and solemnly welcomed and received by all members of the farm.

Accompanying Chairman Liu Shaoqi to the farm were Leonid Brezhnev, Member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, Kirill Mazurov, Alternate Member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Byelorussia, Vasily Kozlov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian Republic, Tikhon Kiselev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Byelorussian Republic, and Stepan Chervonenko, Soviet Ambassador to China.

Accompanying Chairman Liu Shaoqi were Li Jingquan, Lu Dingyi, Yang Shangkun, Liu Ningyi, and Liu Xiao, members of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation.

On the way to the farm, many people waved to greet the distinguished guests.

The collective farm members warmly welcomed Chairman Liu Shaoqi on the main road of the farm. The national flags of China, the Soviet Union, and the Byelorussian Republic were hung on the farm buildings, along with banners written in Chinese and Russian saying "Welcome Chairman Liu Shaoqi!" and "Welcome the Chinese Party and Government Delegation!"

According to traditional custom, a female farm member presented Chairman Liu Shaoqi with bread and salt.

The farm's vice chairman, Shimansky, introduced the farm's history, scale, achievements, and various aspects to the Chinese guests.

The primary school students of the farm's music school presented flowers and red scarves to the Chinese guests and performed musical programs. Chairman Liu Shaoqi and others visited the farm's breeding farm and inquired about the lives and work of the female farm members working there, and took pictures with them.

A mass meeting was held at the farm's club. The farm's agronomist, Puputus, said in his speech that the visit of the Chinese guests to our farm is a great honor for all of us. The achievements of the Chinese people are the achievements of the Soviet people. Your achievements have increased the strength of the entire socialist camp.

Female farm member Shpakovskaya said in her speech that the people of China and the Soviet Union are dear brothers. We, the people of Byelorussia, warmly welcome the representatives of the Chinese people. Although China and Byelorussia are far apart, our hearts are linked together, and our friendship will continue to grow.

The farm's Communist Youth League secretary, Velikhak, said in his speech that the farm's youth have made important contributions to the development of the agricultural economy. The farm's youth will continue to work hard to develop our economy and the friendship between our two countries' youth.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Chairman Brezhnev spoke at the meeting.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi first expressed his gratitude to the farm members for their warm welcome and reception to the delegation.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi said that during the Second World War, the Byelorussian Republic suffered serious damage from the German fascist bandits, and your farm also suffered great damage. However, you carried out heroic guerrilla warfare during the war, and finally you drove out and annihilated the German fascist bandits. In the post-war period, you used heroic labor to restore this farm. Today, we are very happy to hear about the achievements your farm has made.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi said that it is very important for the farm members to engage in agricultural labor. Because agriculture occupies a very important position in the national economy, it is closely related to industry and other sectors of the national economy, as well as culture and education. In recent years, the Central Committee of the CPSU, under the leadership of Comrade Khrushchev, has passed a number of resolutions to vigorously develop agriculture, which is of great significance.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi said that we are very happy to hear about your achievements in developing agriculture. We sincerely congratulate all the people of Byelorussia and the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union on their greater achievements in agriculture and all sectors of the national economy.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi said that the people of our two countries, China and the Soviet Union, must unite closely. Please believe that the Chinese people will always stand with the Soviet people. The imperialists' attempt to undermine our unity will never succeed.

Chairman Liu finally shouted: Long live the great and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people! Long live the Byelorussian Republic! Long live the Communist Party of the Soviet Union!

Speaking at the meeting, Brezhnev conveyed the sincere greetings of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Soviet government to the farmers of the Castro Collective Farm. He said, I am very pleased to learn that you have done so much in such a short period of time with your heroic selfless labor. Your achievements prove that our party's policy aimed at drastically improving agriculture is being implemented victoriously.

Brezhnev said, I have been happy to accompany the Party and Government Delegation of the People's Republic of China—the envoys of the great Chinese people who have the greatest friendship with us Soviet people—on a trip to various parts of the Soviet Union for several days. This friendship has great international significance. The unity of our two countries is the most important factor in fighting to prevent war and ensure a peaceful life in the world.

He said, your cordial hospitality to all of us today is also a vivid manifestation of Soviet-Chinese friendship. Brezhnev concluded by saying, please allow me to join you all in shouting to our Chinese brothers: Our friendship with you is eternal and unbreakable! Please allow me to once again wish the Chinese people new achievements in socialist construction!

After the mass meeting, the masses applauded warmly and bid farewell to the distinguished guests.

    新华社明斯克5日电　中共中央副主席、中华人民共和国主席、中国党政代表团团长刘少奇，今天下午前往参观了明斯克附近的加斯特罗集体农庄，受到了农庄全体庄员热情隆重的欢迎和接待。
    陪同刘少奇主席前往农庄的有苏共中央主席团委员、苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席勃列日涅夫，苏共中央主席团候补委员、白俄罗斯共产党中央委员会第一书记马祖罗夫，白俄罗斯共和国最高苏维埃主席团主席瓦·伊·科兹洛夫，白俄罗斯共和国部长会议主席基谢廖夫，苏联驻中国大使契尔沃年科等人。
    随同刘少奇主席前往参观的有中国党政代表团团员李井泉、陆定一、杨尚昆、刘宁一和刘晓。
    在刘少奇主席前往农庄途中，有许多群众向贵宾们招手致意。
    集体农庄庄员们到农庄的大路上热烈欢迎刘少奇主席。农庄的建筑物上悬挂着中国、苏联、白俄罗斯共和国的国旗，悬挂着用中、俄文写的“欢迎刘少奇主席！”“欢迎中国党政代表团”的标语。
    按照传统的风俗，一位农庄女庄员向刘少奇主席献了面包和盐。
    农庄副主席希曼斯基向中国贵宾们介绍了农庄的历史、规模、取得的成就和各方面的情况。
    农庄的音乐学校的小学生们向中国贵宾们献了花和红领巾，并且表演了音乐节目。刘少奇主席等参观了农庄的饲养场，并且询问了在饲养场工作的女庄员的生活和工作情况，和她们一起照了像。
    在农庄俱乐部举行了群众大会。农庄的农艺师普普图斯在致词中说，中国客人来我们农庄访问，使我们全体庄员感到十分荣幸，中国人民的成就就是我们苏联人民的成就。你们的成就增加了整个社会主义阵营的力量。
    女庄员什帕科夫斯卡娅在讲话中说，中苏两国人民是亲爱的兄弟，我们白俄罗斯人民热烈欢迎中国人民的代表。中国和白俄罗斯虽然相隔很远，但是，我们的心是连在一起的，我们的友谊将不断发展。
    农庄共青团书记魏立夏克在讲话中说，农庄青年们在发展农业经济中，作出了重要贡献。农庄的青年们将继续努力发展我们的经济，发展我们两国青年间的友谊。
    刘少奇主席和勃列日涅夫主席在大会上讲了话。
    刘少奇主席首先向农庄庄员对代表团的热烈欢迎和接待表示感谢。
    刘少奇主席说，在第二次世界大战时，白俄罗斯共和国受到了德国法西斯匪帮的严重破坏，你们的农庄，也受到了很大的破坏，但是你们在战争时期进行了英勇的游击战争，最后你们终于把德国法西斯匪帮赶出去并且消灭了。在战后时期，你们又用英勇的劳动把这个农庄恢复起来。今天听到你们农庄取得的成绩，我们非常高兴。
    刘少奇主席说，庄员同志们从事农业劳动是非常重要的劳动。因为农业在国民经济中占有非常重要的地位，它同工业和国民经济其他部门及文化教育有着非常密切的联系。近几年来，苏共中央在赫鲁晓夫同志领导下，通过了若干大力发展农业的决议，这是有重大意义的事情。
    刘少奇主席说，我们很高兴听到你们发展农业的成就。我们衷心祝贺全白俄罗斯人民和苏联各族人民在农业和国民经济各部门中获得更大的成就。
    刘少奇主席说，我们中苏两国人民要紧密地团结起来，请你们相信，中国人民在任何时候都与苏联人民站在一起。帝国主义者企图破坏我们的团结是永远也达不到目的的。
    刘主席最后高呼：中苏两国人民伟大的、牢不可破的友谊万岁！白俄罗斯共和国万岁！苏联共产党万岁！
    勃列日涅夫在会上讲话时代表苏共中央和苏联政府向加斯特罗集体农庄的农民衷心致意。他说，我很高兴地了解到，你们在短短的时期内用自己英雄的忘我的劳动做了这么许多事情。你们的成就证明，我们党的旨在急剧提高农业的政策正在胜利地实行。
    勃列日涅夫说，我愉快地陪同中华人民共和国党政代表团——同我们苏联人有着最伟大的友谊联系的伟大中国人民的使者——到苏联各地旅行已经好几天了。这个友谊具有重大的国际意义。我们两个国家团结在一起，是为防止战争、为保障世界上的和平生活而斗争的最重要的因素。
    他说，你们今天对我们大家的殷勤招待，也是苏中友谊的鲜明表现。勃列日涅夫最后说，请允许我同你们大家一道向中国兄弟们高呼：我们同你们的友谊是永恒的和牢不可破的！请允许我再一次预祝中国人民在社会主义建设中取得新的成就！
    群众大会结束后，群众热烈鼓掌，欢送贵宾。
