Liaoning Small Commodities
	"Old Wang Ladle" Increases Production
	The frying pan – "Old Wang Ladle" – produced by the Shenyang Hardware Tool Factory is thin-edged, thick-bottomed, and has a smooth surface, making it perennially popular.

	In order to further increase market supply, the factory recently strengthened its technical force and expanded its production capacity. Daily output soared from fifty to one hundred and ten. Since the beginning of this year, the factory has produced more than 17,000 frying pans of various specifications.

	Steel Wire Hair Clips
	The Yunji Street People's Commune in Shenyang City has established a specialized factory with a monthly output of 50,000 boards of hair clips. The hair clips produced are small and exquisite, with beautiful styles, great elasticity, and are durable. Since production began in October, it had produced 90,000 boards of hair clips by the end of November.

	Making up for Deficiencies
	In order to meet the needs of bicycle repairs, the Qidao Commune in Andong City established a vehicle parts factory. The factory was established not long ago, and its technical equipment was not yet complete. The workers used old materials to build a homemade grinding machine. Although the grinding machine is simple, the effect is very considerable. Now, this factory can produce not only bicycle ball bearings, but also axle cups and other small parts.

	New Style Stove
Xinhua News Agency.
	As soon as the severe winter arrived, the Xinghua People's Commune Daily Metal Products Factory in Tiexi District, Shenyang City, produced a large number of new-style stoves for the general public. This kind of stove is made of one-inch-wide scrap steel strip edges, processed and meshed by craftsmen. The stove made of steel strip edges has a double-layer body, which can prolong its service life.

    辽宁小商品
    “王大勺”增产
    沈阳市五金工具厂生产的炒勺——“王大勺”，边薄、底厚、表面光滑，经久耐用，一向为人们所乐用。
    为了进一步增加市场供应，最近，这个厂充实了技术力量，扩大生产能力。日产量从五十把激增到一百一十把。今年以来，这个厂已经生产出各种规格的炒勺一万七千多把。
    钢丝细发卡
    沈阳市云集街人民公社建立起一个月产五万板发卡的专业工厂。生产出的发卡小巧玲珑，样式美观，弹力大，经久耐用。从10月投入生产以来，到11月末，已经生产了九万板发卡。
    拾遗补缺
    为了满足修理自行车的需要，安东市七道公社建立了车辆部件厂。这个厂建厂不久，技术设备还不够齐全，工人们利用旧材料自制成功一台土磨床。磨床虽土，效果却非常可观。如今这个厂既能生产自行车滚珠，又能制造车轴碗以及其它各种小部件。
    新式炉子
    严冬刚到，沈阳市铁西区兴华人民公社日用金属制品厂就为广大市民生产出大批新式炉子。这种炉子是用一寸宽的废钢带边子经过匠人们加工咬合编成的。用钢带边子编的炉子，炉体是双层的，使用年限可以延长。　（新华社）
