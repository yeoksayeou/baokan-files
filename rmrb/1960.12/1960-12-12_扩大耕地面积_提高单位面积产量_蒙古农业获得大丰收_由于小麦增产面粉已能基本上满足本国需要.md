Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, December 7th: Mongolian agriculture has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year. Thanks to the agricultural harvest, especially the wheat harvest, the country's flour supply can now basically meet domestic needs.

This was stated by Mongolian Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, Lin Qin, during a recent interview with a Xinhua News Agency reporter. He said that Mongolia's total grain output this year reached 253,500 tons, an increase of 87.5% compared with last year's total output, exceeding the planned output by about 25%. Among them, the total wheat output reached 214,600 tons, exceeding the plan by 33%.

Lin Qin said that due to the unprecedented agricultural harvest, the grain turned over to the state by various state-owned farms has also greatly exceeded the plan. The total grain turned over nationwide was 127,000 tons, while the plan stipulated 119,000 tons. This year, agricultural and pastoral cooperatives will for the first time turn over 13,000 tons of grain to the state.

He said that the good harvest in Mongolian agriculture is mainly due to the expansion of cultivated land area and the increase in yield per unit area. This year, the country's cultivated land area was 252,000 hectares, an increase of about 100,000 hectares compared with last year, and the average yield per hectare also increased from 1.1 tons last year to 1.23 tons.

He said that many advanced state-owned farms and ranches have emerged in Mongolia this year. The state-owned farms and ranches of Donghara, Chagantolagai, Rejialantu, and Tsileteer all overfulfilled the state plan. Among them, the Donghara State Farm created a high-yield record of averaging 1.88 tons per hectare on 4,000 hectares of cultivated land. The cultivated land of the Tsileteer State Farm was newly reclaimed and lacked water, but thanks to the active efforts of all employees, it achieved an average yield of 1.52 tons per hectare on the newly reclaimed 14,000 hectares of land in the first year.

He said that at present, the vast number of employees of state-owned farms and ranches are plowing fallow land, transporting and selecting seeds, and overhauling machinery, to do all the preparations for spring plowing to meet a greater harvest next year.

    扩大耕地面积　提高单位面积产量
    蒙古农业获得大丰收
    由于小麦增产面粉已能基本上满足本国需要
    新华社乌兰巴托7日电　蒙古农业今年获得了空前大丰收。由于农业丰收，特别是小麦丰收，本国的面粉供应已经基本上可以满足本国需要。
    这是蒙古农牧部副部长林钦最近接见新华社记者时说的。他说，蒙古今年谷物总产量达二十五万三千五百吨，比去年总产量增加了87.5％，超过计划规定的产量25％左右。其中小麦总产量达二十一万四千六百吨，超过计划33％。
    林钦说，由于农业空前丰收，各国营农场上缴给国家的谷物也大大超过了计划。全国上缴的谷物为十二万七千吨，而计划规定的是十一万九千吨。各农牧业合作社今年将第一次向国家上缴一万三千吨谷物。
    他说，蒙古农业获得这样好的收成，主要是由于扩大了耕地面积和提高了单位面积产量的结果。今年全国的耕地面积为二十五万二千公顷，比去年增加了十万公顷左右，每公顷的平均产量也由去年的十一公担提高到十二点三公担。
    他说，今年蒙古出现了很多先进的国营农牧场。东哈拉、查干陶勒盖、热加兰图、茨勒特尔等国营农牧场都超额完成了国家计划。其中东哈拉国营农牧场创造了在四千公顷耕地上平均每公顷收获十八点八公担的高产纪录。茨勒特尔国营农牧场的耕地都是新开垦的，而且缺水，但由于全场职工的积极努力，第一年就在新开垦的一万四千公顷土地上获得了平均每公顷收获十五点二公担的产量。
    他说，目前国营农牧场的广大职工正在翻耕休耕地，调运种子和选种，检修机械，以做好春耕前的一切准备工作来迎接明年更大的丰收。
