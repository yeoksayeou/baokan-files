Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 30th – In the mass movement of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, the health departments of Haining County, Zhejiang Province, have mobilized more than 1,000 health workers from various people's commune hospitals and management district health clinics to return to the forefront of agricultural production, both directly supporting agricultural production and strengthening medical and health work at the forefront of production.
    After returning to their agricultural production posts, these grassroots rural health personnel work and live with the commune members, and continue to play the role of rural health backbone under the guidance of medical personnel. This makes health work more deeply rooted in production and among the masses. After returning to the front lines, health workers from communes such as Xieqiao and Xiashi assist the small team leaders in checking attendance and the health of commune members before going to work each day. If a commune member is found to be ill, they are treated immediately. For patients who need further treatment, they are quickly reported to the mobile medical doctors so that they can receive timely treatment. During work breaks in the fields, they actively carry out mobile medical services and health education. In the evenings, they assist doctors in treating illnesses and delivering medicine to people's homes. The health workers who returned to the peace production teams of the Xiashi Commune have all actively participated in labor, and have equipped each of the eight small teams with a first-aid kit, greatly strengthening health care at the forefront. Several canteens in this team, with the help of health workers, have improved their sanitation work compared to the past. After returning to the front lines, Shen Liubao, a health worker in the Tangqiao production team of the Hutang Commune, has become a production expert and has also carried out health work very well. During this autumn harvest and winter planting season, Shen Liubao led an operating team, and the average daily rice cutting per person exceeded the quota by about 50%. She has now been elected by the masses as the women's captain of the production team. She is very concerned about women's labor protection and has a detailed understanding of the health conditions of all sixty-five female commune members in the team, and often arranges appropriate farm work for them. The masses call her the "woman leader."
    After returning to the production front lines, these health workers also strengthened their ties with the health workers who were originally on the front lines, actively helping them to improve their level of health knowledge. Some have established a regular meeting system to understand difficulties and solve them in a timely manner, and report their good deeds to the production team in a timely manner to commend them and boost their morale. Some commune hospitals, while strengthening guidance for veteran health workers, also focus on training new health workers. Of the eighteen small teams in the Zhongle production team of the Xieqiao Commune, only eight originally had health workers. Recently, under the leadership of the production team's Party branch, after training, each small team now has a health worker.

    海宁一千多医务人员返回农业前线
    生产打先锋  医疗逞能手
    新华社杭州30日电　在大办农业、大办粮食的群众运动中，浙江省海宁县卫生部门从各人民公社医院和管理区保健所动员了一千多名卫生保健人员回到了农业生产第一线，既直接支援了农业生产，又加强了生产第一线的医疗保健工作。
    这批农村基层卫生人员回到农业生产岗位以后，同社员群众一起劳动，一起生活，并且继续在医务人员指导下发挥农村卫生骨干的作用，这就使卫生工作更加深入生产，深入群众。斜桥、硖石等公社回到第一线的保健员，每天出工以前都协助小队长检查出勤和社员健康情况，发现社员有病，立即治疗，对需要进一步治疗的病员，就迅速报告巡回医疗的医生，使病员及时得到治疗。在田间劳动休息时间，他们主动开展巡回医疗和卫生常识宣传工作；晚上，又协助医生治病和送药上门。回到硖石公社和平生产队各小队的保健员们，人人积极劳动，并且在八个小队都配备起保健箱，大大加强了第一线的卫生保健工作。这个队有好几个食堂，在保健员的帮助下，卫生工作比过去搞得更好了。湖塘公社塘桥生产队保健员沈六宝回到第一线后，既成了生产能手，又很好地开展了卫生保健工作。在这次秋收冬种中，沈六宝带领一个操作组，平均每人每天割稻都超过定额50％左右。现在她已被群众选为生产队妇女队长。她对妇女劳动保护工作非常关心体贴，全队六十五个女社员的健康情况她都详细了解，并且经常妥善地为她们安排适当的农活，群众都称她为“女当家”。
    这些卫生保健人员回到生产第一线后，还加强了同原来在第一线的保健员的联系，积极帮助他们提高卫生知识水平。有的建立了定期碰头制度，及时了解困难，解决困难，并把她们中的好人好事向生产队汇报，及时表扬，鼓舞干劲。有的公社医院在加强辅导老保健员的同时，也有重点地注意培养新保健员。斜桥公社仲乐生产队的十八个小队中，原来只有八个保健员，最近在生产队党支部领导下，经过训练培养，已达到每小队有一名保健员。
