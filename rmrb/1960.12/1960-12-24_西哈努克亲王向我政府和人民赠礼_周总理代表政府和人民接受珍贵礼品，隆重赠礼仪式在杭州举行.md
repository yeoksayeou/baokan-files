Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, December 23rd: Cambodian Head of State Prince Norodom Sihanouk, on behalf of the Royal Government and people of Cambodia, presented gifts to the Government and people of the People's Republic of China this afternoon in Hangzhou. Premier Zhou Enlai accepted these precious gifts on behalf of our Government and people, expressing the Cambodian people's close friendship towards the Chinese people.

The grand presentation ceremony was held at the Hangzhou Hotel. The gifts were two stone Buddha statues, each over a foot tall, which had been treasured in the Cambodian Museum. These two Buddha statues are valuable cultural relics unearthed from the famous ancient Cambodian royal palace ruins of Angkor, dating back a thousand years. The Royal Government of Cambodia attached two official certificates of authenticity to these two precious historical artifacts. On the bronze plaque at the base of the Buddha statues, the following Chinese characters were engraved: "Presented by Cambodian Head of State Prince Norodom Sihanouk on behalf of the Royal Government and people of Cambodia to the Government and people of the People's Republic of China to express fraternal gratitude."

Prince Sihanouk delivered a warm speech at the presentation ceremony, which was filled with a cordial and friendly atmosphere. He said that as they were about to conclude this yet another unforgettable visit, he was honored and pleased to present the two stone statues carved by Khmer artists of Angkor a thousand years ago to the Chinese government and people. He said, "This gift from the Khmer people is very meager compared to the consistent support China has given to our country internationally and the enormous assistance in raising the living standards of our people and developing our economy. But we would like to take this opportunity, during the Cambodian Head of State's visit to China, to express our fraternal gratitude and unbreakable friendship."

Prince Sihanouk said that these two stone statues came from Angkor, which the Khmer people cherish the most. "Angkor tells us that as long as we are united and work hard, a small nation can create a bright future for itself."

In his reply, Premier Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, expressed his warm gratitude to the Cambodian Head of State, the Royal Government of Cambodia, and the Cambodian people for their friendly feelings towards the Chinese people. He said: "It is very meaningful for us to accept these cultural relics of precious historical value from your country in the beautiful and culturally rich city of Hangzhou. The Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk, the Royal Government of Cambodia, and the Cambodian people have presented such precious gifts to the Chinese government and people, which fully embodies the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian people." Premier Zhou Enlai wished the friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian people would develop forever, and repeatedly expressed his deep gratitude to Prince Sihanouk.

At the presentation ceremony, Prince Sihanouk also presented a sum of US$50,000 to our country's welfare organizations. This gift was accepted and transferred by Vice Premier Chen Yi.
