    Strengthen Unity, Persist in Struggle
    Workers in Various Parts of France Go on Strike One After Another
    Dutch Metalworkers Strike and Demonstrate Demanding Wage Increases
    Since the beginning of winter, the broad masses of workers in France have launched actions demanding wage increases and improved working conditions. As unity among workers has strengthened, workers' struggles have achieved certain victories in some industries, and in others, employees are persisting in their struggles.
    On the 16th, postal workers across France held a strike, demanding wage increases. According to "l'Humanité," the strike of postal workers was particularly large in Paris, Dijon, Toulouse, Montpellier, Nantes, Orleans, Lyon, and Bordeaux, with 75% to 100% of postal workers participating in the struggle. In many cities, grassroots organizations of different unions took joint action, disregarding the opposition of the socialist party's union leaders and the leaders of the Catholic union organizations.
    Seven thousand workers at glass factories in the Nord, Somme, and Vosges departments announced a strike. Workers on the gas transmission network in the suburbs of Paris also launched a strike struggle demanding wage increases.
    The strike of flight personnel on many routes of "Air France" has been going on for two weeks, and the strike committee decided on the 17th to continue the struggle.
    In Haute-Savoie, the joint struggle of construction workers belonging to different unions has already forced the capitalists to increase wages by 6%. Workers' strikes in many enterprise sectors of the metal processing industry, mining industry, and food industry have also achieved victories.
    Under the call of the National Federation of Miners of the French General Confederation of Labor, a signature campaign is currently underway among miners nationwide, demanding higher wages and shorter underground working hours.
    Metalworkers in Rotterdam, Amsterdam, and other cities in the Netherlands held strikes. According to the Netherlands News Agency, more than 15,000 workers participated in the strike, and workers in many areas also held demonstrations. The reason for the strike was the government's refusal to meet workers' demands for wage increases.
