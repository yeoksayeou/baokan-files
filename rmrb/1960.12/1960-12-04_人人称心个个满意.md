Everyone Satisfied, Every Individual Pleased

Communist Party member Wang Kun is the administrator of the Tianjin First Native Produce Selection and Sorting Factory's employee cafeteria. From the first day he accepted the administrator's job, he thought: "Managing the meals for hundreds of people is a major task. The Party has entrusted me with such a heavy responsibility, I must manage it well and not allow it to be managed poorly." Some people say: Being an administrator is a thankless task, it's hard to please everyone. Wang Kun disagreed with this view. He was determined: He would definitely make it possible to please everyone!

Wang Kun knew: To run the cafeteria well, he must rely on everyone who eats in the cafeteria. Therefore, he often solicited everyone's opinions to improve the cafeteria's work. The cafeteria used mixed coarse grains to make dumplings for everyone. The dough was a bit sticky and didn't taste very good. Someone said: It would be delicious to mix some white flour into the coarse grains and make pancakes. Wang Kun heard this, and the next day, the cooks made pancakes with both types of flour, adding some scallions, which the masses were very satisfied with. In August and September, some employees often went to other places to participate in voluntary labor. Wang Kun often pushed a cart to deliver meals to the comrades.

In order to manage the cafeteria well, Wang Kun always paid attention to exploring the rules. He knew by heart how much rice to steam with one jin of rice, how many steamed buns to make with one jin of flour, and he could even tell at a glance whether there was enough porridge in the bowl. Recently, employees have implemented planned grain consumption. Wang Kun has improved the measuring tools for rice and flour, making them both convenient and accurate. Wang Kun often pays attention to who likes to eat sour food and who likes to eat spicy food. Some employees in the factory suffer from stomach problems. As soon as they stand at Wang Kun's food selling window, Wang Kun will pick out a bowl of softer rice for them without them even saying a word. Therefore, some people said to him with emotion: "You understand my taste like you are a member of my family."

Wang Kun is an administrator and a purchasing agent. He goes to the market every morning before dawn. When the cooks are about to start cooking, he uses a cart to bring back the rice, flour, and vegetables. In order not to affect the cooks' cooking, he always carries the things into the warehouse one trip at a time by himself. For ten years, he has been working diligently like this every day. For several years, this large cafeteria serving more than 1,500 people has been rated as an advanced cafeteria.

    人人称心个个满意
    共产党员王昆是天津第一土产挑选整理厂职工食堂的管理员。自从他接受管理员工作的第一天就想：“管好几百口子吃饭，可是件大事，党把这么重的责任交给自己，只能管好，不许管坏。”有人说：当管理员就是费力不讨好，一人难称百人心。王昆不同意这种说法。他下定决心：非叫它来个一人能称百人心不可！
    王昆知道：要办好食堂必须依靠每一个在食堂吃饭的人。所以，他经常征求大家的意见，改进食堂工作。食堂用杂合面给大家包了些饺子。面有点发粘，不大好吃。有人说：杂面掺点白面烙饼好吃。王昆听见了，第二天，炊事员就烙了两样面的饼，还加了点葱花儿，群众非常满意。8、9月份，有些职工常到其他地方参加义务劳动，王昆经常推着车子给同志们送饭。
    为了把食堂管好，王昆随时随地留心摸索规律。一斤米蒸多少饭、一斤面蒸多少馒头，他都背得烂熟，甚至碗里的稀饭够不够份量，他一眼就能看出。最近，职工们实行了计划用粮，王昆改进了量米面的用具，又方便，又准确。王昆经常注意哪些人爱吃酸的，哪些人又爱吃辣的。厂里有些患胃病的职工，只要他们往王昆卖饭的窗口一站，不等说话，王昆就会挑一碗软些的饭给他。所以，有些人感动地对他说：“你简直像我家里人一样了解我的口胃。”
    王昆是个管理员，也是个采购员。他每天清早天还不大亮，就到市场上去了。等炊事员们快做饭的时候，他就用车把米、面、蔬菜推了回来。为了不影响炊事员们做饭，他总是一个人把东西一趟一趟地送进仓库。十年来，他每天是这样勤勤恳恳地工作着。几年来，这个一千五百多人吃饭的大食堂，一直被评为先进食堂。
