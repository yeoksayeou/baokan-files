    A Washbasin
    Qin Ling, Xi'an Gas Manufacturing Factory
    The afterglow of the sun painted the treetops of the poplars in front of the workshop door with a pale yellow. The factory siren emitted a pleasant sound – “Ooo-ooo” it called. The workers were off duty. I put away my tools, washed my hands, and walked slowly towards the canteen.
    From afar, I saw a dark crowd of people gathered at the entrance of the canteen, guessing that something new must have happened. I quickened my pace and rushed there. I stood on tiptoes and scanned the crowd. There was nothing, just a half-worn washbasin. “Isn't this the washbasin I threw away? How did it get here!” I was very surprised. I looked closer and saw that the washbasin had been repaired, and the repair was very smooth. As soon as I looked up, I saw a square red piece of paper pasted on the wall with the following words:
    This washbasin was picked up in the factory's garbage dump and has now been repaired. If it belongs to you, please take it and please come to see me…
                      Zhang Laoshun, October 25th
    "Oh! How did my father pick it up? This is terrible!" I was so surprised that I almost cried out. The workers next to me were discussing one after another, "This person is too outrageous to throw away such a good washbasin!"
    My ears heard these discussions, my face turned "shua" red, and my heart "thumped". I took the washbasin and walked into the canteen with my head down. The comrades all scanned me with sharp eyes. I swallowed the food in two or three mouthfuls, took the washbasin, and went to see my father with a stiff upper lip.
    I walked into the third dormitory of the dormitory building and saw my father holding a newspaper in both hands, his eyes fixed on something in the newspaper. He was wearing a set of labor cloth work clothes, with dense patches on them. I knew that my father had not received work clothes from the public in three years.
    "Dad," I called out timidly. He raised his head, his dark eyes staring at me. His round face, his brush-like beard, changed in an instant.
    "What, this washbasin is yours?" he asked me sternly.
    "Yes," I responded.
    "I heard that your washbasin had a few small holes and you didn't want it anymore! Alas, young people! When you taste the sweet, you forget the bitter." His beard was upturned with anger. I had never seen him so angry. I didn't dare to breathe and listened to him say, "You probably forgot all about the past! Use things, new for three years, old for three years, mend them and use them for another three years…"
    I stole a glance at my father's radiant face and suddenly remembered my father's yellow and thin face in the old society. A desolate scene instantly appeared before my eyes.
    That was during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. My father and I carried a load of broken furniture, relying on mending pots and washbasins for a living. One day, it was very cold. We were mending pots in a village. An old lady, about fifty years old, wearing ragged clothes, brought us a washbasin to repair. The washbasin was already broken into a triangle, with two palm-sized holes in the bottom. How could this be repaired? We said, "Old lady, this washbasin is really beyond repair."
    The old lady's teeth were chattering from the cold. She pleaded, "Master, please do me a favor and fix it. I really can't afford a good washbasin." My father saw her pitiful appearance and tried to fix it for her.
    After liberation, we no longer wandered. My father entered the factory as a welder, and I also entered the factory to work. …Thinking, thinking, my eyes blurred. My washbasin only had two small holes and a little bit of enamel chipped off, and I threw it away. My father was right, I tasted the sweet and forgot the bitter. I looked up at my father. My father seemed to be thinking about something. He said gently, "Child, you must live a rich life as if it were a poor one. Our country is still very poor. We can't be so extravagant!"
    After he finished speaking, he paused for a while and said, "I have already handed over the money for the solder used to repair the washbasin to the public. In the future…"
    Dad, please don't say anything. In the future, in the future, I will remember the story of this washbasin for the rest of my life.

    一个脸盆
    西安市气体制造厂　秦岭
    太阳的余辉给车间门前的白杨树梢涂上了淡黄色，工厂的汽笛发出了悦耳的声音——“呜呜”地叫着。职工同志们下班了。我收拾了工具，洗完手，慢步朝食堂走去。
    老远，我就看见食堂门口围着黑压压的一堆人，猜想一定有什么新鲜事。我迈大步子，急急走到那里，我垫高了脚，眼睛一扫，什么也没有，仅仅有一个半旧的脸盆。“这脸盆不是我扔掉的那一个么？怎么跑到这里来了！”我很奇怪，近前一看，这脸盆补好了，补得很平滑，我刚一抬头，只见墙上贴着一张四四方方的红纸，上面写着：
    这脸盆是在厂后垃圾堆里拾到的，现已补好，是谁的，请拿去，并希到我处去一下……
                      张老顺　10、25
    “呀！怎么给我父亲拾到了，真糟糕！”我惊奇地差点叫出声来。旁边的工人同志你一言，我一语地议论着：“这人太不像话了，这样好的脸盆就扔掉！”
    我的耳朵听到这些议论声，脸“唰”地红了，心里“咚咚”地跳。我拿了脸盆，低着头走进食堂，同志们都用锐利的眼睛扫视着我。我三扒两咽把饭吃完了，拿上脸盆，硬着头皮去见父亲。
    我走进宿舍大楼第三寝室，只见父亲两手拿着报，一双眼睛在盯住报上什么东西。他穿一身劳动布工作服，上面补着密密麻麻的补钉。我知道父亲已有三年没有向公家领工作服了。
    “爸爸”我提心吊胆地叫了一声。他一抬头，那双黑洞洞的眼睛盯着我，他那圆圆的脸，那像毛刷一样的胡子，刹时变样了。
    “怎么，这脸盆是你的？”他严肃地问我。
    “嗯。”我应了一声。
    “我说你的脸盆有几个小洞就不要了！唉，真是年青人！吃了甜就不知苦呀。”他的胡子气得翘翘着。我从来也没有看到过他气得这样。我不啃气，低着头听他说：“你大概把过去全给忘了吧！用东西，新三年旧三年，补补用用又三年么，……”
    我偷眼望望父亲红光满面的脸，忽然想起旧社会父亲那黄瘦不堪的脸，一个凄凉的场面刹时浮现在眼前。
    那是在国民党反动派统治时期，父亲带着我挑着一担破家具靠给人补锅、补脸盆维持生活。有一天，天气非常冷，我们在一个村里补锅，一个约莫五十上下的老大娘，穿一身褴褛衣服，拿着一个脸盆让我们修理。这脸盆已经坏成三角形了，盆底有两个手掌一样大的洞，这怎么能补呢，我们说：“老大娘，这脸盆实在不能补了呀。”
    那老大娘冷得上下牙齿直打架，请求道：“老师傅，行行好，给修修吧，实在买不起好脸盆。”我爸看到那可怜的样子，设法给她补好了。
    解放了，我们再也不流浪了。我父亲进工厂当了焊工，我也进工厂工作了。……想着，想着，我的眼睛模糊了，我的脸盆仅仅有两个小洞，边缘掉了一点磁就扔掉了，爸爸说我的一点不错，吃了甜不知苦。我抬头看看父亲，父亲好像在想什么似的，他温和地说：“孩子，富日子要当穷日子过呀，我们国家还很穷啊，不能那么大手大脚的！”
    他说完，停了一会又说：“我已经把补脸盆所用的焊锡折合钱交给公家了，今后……”
    爸爸呀，您就别说了，今后，今后我会把这一只脸盆的故事记住一辈子。
