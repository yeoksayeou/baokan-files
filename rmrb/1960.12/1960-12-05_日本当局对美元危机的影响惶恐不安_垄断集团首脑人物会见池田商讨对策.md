Xinhua News Agency, 4th Dispatch from Tokyo: The Japanese ruling clique is feeling anxious about the emergency measures taken by the United States to pass on the dollar crisis to its "allies." They have had to admit that Japan, which is pursuing a policy of dependence on the United States, will suffer a heavy blow.

According to Kyodo News, the Japanese Embassy in the United States convened a "Government-Private Joint Economic Discussion Meeting" in Washington on the afternoon of December 2nd, bringing together representatives from the Japanese Consulate General in New York and the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in the United States to discuss the impact of the U.S. economic crisis on Japan.

Attendees at the meeting believed that as a result of the U.S. measures to "defend the dollar," "it will be unavoidable to exert pressure on Japan in terms of trade liberalization."

These Japanese officials and economic figures also pointed out that the current trend of decreasing U.S. imports of textile products from Japan is already very clear. They said that this "economic recession" in the United States is "not optimistic."

Japanese bourgeois newspapers and radio stations have recently been commenting on the adverse effects of the dollar crisis on Japan. On the 2nd, Nippon Hoso Kyokai (NHK) also published a commentary entitled "U.S. Dollar Crisis Countermeasures and Japan."

The commentary said: If the chain reaction that the dollar crisis is prone to generating is taken into account, then "the impact on Japan cannot be underestimated." It said that as a result of the United States saving dollars, U.S. overseas procurement from underdeveloped countries in Southeast Asia and other regions will naturally decrease. In this way, Japan's exports to Southeast Asia, which depend on the U.S. overseas procurement plan, will also decrease.

The commentary emphasized: "Therefore, Japanese industrial and trade circles feel very uneasy about this."

According to Japanese radio reports, the heads of Japanese monopoly capital groups, including Kobayashi Ataru, Sakurada Takeshi, and Nagano Shigeo, have already discussed future policy issues, including coping with the dollar crisis, with Japanese Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda. They expressed that recently, the United States has begun to take tough measures to "defend the dollar's" value, and therefore worry about "whether" the so-called "doubling of national income" plan proposed by the Ikeda Cabinet to serve monopoly capital "can be smoothly implemented." They also warned Ikeda "not to be overly optimistic" about the balance of payments.

Referring to the issue of Japan's relations with China, these big capitalists instructed Ikeda: that it is necessary to "look at the attitude of the U.S. Kennedy administration while needing to adopt a more flexible attitude than in the past."

Japanese radio said that within the Japanese government's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, many people believe that Japan's future exports will be "greatly affected" by the dollar crisis and that it will be "difficult to achieve" the plan to increase export volume by 10% in the next year. Therefore, more and more people believe that expanding exports is "a matter of urgency."

    日本当局对美元危机的影响惶恐不安
    垄断集团首脑人物会见池田商讨对策
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本统治集团对美国向它的“盟国”转嫁美元危机的紧急措施感到惶恐不安，他们不得不承认，执行着依赖美国政策的日本将遭受沉重的打击。
    据共同社报道，日本驻美国大使馆2日下午在华盛顿召集日本驻纽约总领事馆、在美国的日本商工会议所的代表举行“官民联合经济恳谈会”，讨论美国经济危机对日本的影响问题。
    出席会议的人认为，美国采取“保卫美元”措施的结果，“在贸易自由化方面对日本施加压力，将是无法避免的”。
    日本的这些官员和经济界人士还指出：目前美国从日本进口的纤维产品正在减少的倾向已经很清楚。他们说，美国的这次“经济衰退”是“不容乐观的”。
    日本资产阶级报纸、电台最近纷纷评论美元危机对日本的不良影响。日本广播协会在2日又发表了题为《美国的美元危机对策与日本》的评论。
    评论说：如果把美元危机容易产生的连锁反应考虑在内的话，那末“对日本的影响是不能轻视的”。它说，美国节约美元的结果，美国向东南亚等地区不发达国家的海外采购自然会减少。这样，日本依赖美国海外采购计划而向东南亚的出口也会减少。
    评论强调说：“因此，日本工业界和贸易界对这一点感到很大的不安”。
    据日本电台报道，日本垄断资本集团的首脑人物小林中、樱田武、永野重雄等已经同日本首相池田勇人商谈了包括应付美元危机的今后政策问题。他们表示：最近，美国为了“保卫美元”的价值已经开始采取强硬措施，因此担心池田内阁提出的为垄断资本服务的所谓“国民收入增加一倍”的计划“是否能够顺利地实行”。他们还警告池田对国际收支“不要抱过分乐观的看法”。
    谈到日本同中国的关系问题时，这些大资本家指示池田：要“一面看看美国肯尼迪政权的态度，一面需要采取比以往更加灵活的态度”。
    日本电台说，在日本政府通商产业省内有好多人认为日本今后的出口将受美元危机的“很大影响”，并且“很难实现”明年度增加出口额10％的计划。因此，越来越多的人认为，扩大出口是“当务之急”。
