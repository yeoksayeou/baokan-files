    Great Wall Elementary School
    Woodcut by Tan Quanshu, Poem by Yuan Ying
    A Great Wall elementary school,
    Brimming with the vitality of spring,
    Old trees sprout new buds,
    Peach blossoms as red as brocade.
    The school bell rings,
    A throng of Young Pioneers rushes out,
    Singing loudly of the commune's goodness,
    Singing loudly of the East is Red.
    The songs drift with the wind,
    Straight to the highest reaches,
    Eastward beyond Yuguan Pass,
    Westward beyond Yumenguan Pass.
    The motherland's mountains and rivers are magnificent,
    The scenery beyond the border is new,
    The Great Wall stretches ten thousand li,
    A beautiful and bright future! (Image attached)

    长城小学
    谭权书木刻　袁鹰  配诗
    长城一小学，
    春意正充盈，
    老树出新芽，
    桃花红似锦。
    下课铃声响，
    拥出红领巾，
    高唱公社好，
    高唱东方红。
    歌声随风飘，
    直上最高层，
    向东出榆关，
    向西出玉门。
    祖国山河壮，
    塞上风景新，
    长城一万里，
    锦绣好前程！（附图片）
