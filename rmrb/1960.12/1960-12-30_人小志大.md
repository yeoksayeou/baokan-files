    Small in Stature, Great in Ambition
    One afternoon in December, I went to the Fengfeng Coal Mine Coke Plant in Handan on business. Near the plant, I saw Baowen, the son of the Coke Plant's Party Secretary, running back and forth on the road with a small basket, busy picking up pieces of coal that had fallen from the trucks. Before long, the small basket was full. As I walked, I looked back and saw him running quickly, dumping the coke on the coal pile in the plant, and then running back quickly again.
    Although Baowen is young, he has the great ambition of building the country through diligence and thrift. We should all learn from his spirit of cherishing state property.

    人小志大
    12月的一天下午，我因公事去邯郸峰峰矿焦厂，走到厂子附近，看见焦厂党委书记的儿子宝文，提着个小篮子在大道上跑来跑去，忙着拣从车子上掉下来的煤块。不大的工夫，那个小篮子已满满的了。我边走边回头，只见他飞快地跑着，把焦煤倒在厂子里的煤堆上后，又飞快地跑了回来。
    宝文年纪虽小，却有勤俭建国的大志。我们都应该学习他这种爱护国家财产的精神。
