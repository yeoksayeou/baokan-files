Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 1st: The counties in the suburbs of Shanghai are seizing the opportune time to develop diversified winter operations.

The suburban counties of Shanghai have numerous diversified business projects, including field planting of vegetables, processing of agricultural and sideline products, collection of wild plants, weaving of yellow grass products, hunting, fishing and shrimp catching, and large-scale short-distance transportation. There are nearly a hundred types of projects. According to the characteristics of diversified operations being large-scale and small-scale, concentrated and decentralized, the counties and communes have divided the scope of operations for communes, production teams, production groups, and commune members' families, and determined the income distribution principles.

The Party committees from the county to the people's commune in the suburbs of Shanghai have universally strengthened their leadership over diversified operations, grasping both planning and policies, and helping production teams and groups solve specific problems in developing diversified operations, such as various materials, technologies, and product outlets. Fei Helin, the Party Secretary of Datuan Commune in Nanhui County, went deep into the Ginkgo Production Team to help formulate plans. He also personally made more than 20 tools for catching yellow weasels and caught yellow weasels with the commune members. In order to support poor teams in developing diversified operations, the supply and marketing department of this commune also organized more than 100 dan of thatch, raw silk, etc., and specially entrusted Zhennan, Yachang and other teams to process straw ropes and lampshades.

The production teams and production groups of the suburban communes, under the premise of ensuring the current agricultural work, have properly arranged the labor force for diversified operations, and in accordance with the principle of adapting to people and things, they have organized hunting "sharpshooters," fishing experts, and various skilled personnel to give full play to their respective strengths in order to achieve the maximum economic effect with the least manpower. The Qujia Production Team of Zhangjiang Commune in Chuansha County organized nine fishing experts to engage in large-scale fishing. In just two days, they caught more than 600 jin of river fresh produce.

    上海郊区开展冬季多种经营
    根据不同特点划分经营范围确定分配原则
    合理安排劳力充分发挥特长力求最大效果
    据新华社上海1日电　上海市郊区各县抓紧时机，开展冬季多种经营活动。
    上海郊区各县开展多种经营的项目繁多，有大田播种蔬菜、农副产品加工、采集野生植物、编织黄草制品、打猎、捕捞鱼虾、大搞短途运输等，项目近百种。各县、社根据多种经营有大宗的和小宗的，有集中的和分散的特点，划分了公社、生产队、生产小队和社员家庭经营的范围，并确定了收入分配原则。
    上海郊区各县从县到人民公社的党委，普遍加强了对多种经营的领导，既抓规划、政策，又帮助生产队和小队解决开展多种经营中各种物资、技术、产品出路等具体问题。南汇县大团公社党委书记费鹤林，深入银杏生产队帮助制定规划，还亲自动手，做了二十多只打黄狼的工具，与社员一起捉黄狼。这个公社的供销部门为了支持穷队开展多种经营，还组织一百多担茅草、生丝等，专门委托镇南、鸭场等队加工草绳、灯罩。
    郊区各公社的生产队和生产小队在保证作好当前各项农活的前提下，都妥善地安排了多种经营的劳动力，并按照因人因事制宜的原则，把打猎“神枪手”、捕鱼能手和各种有技术的人材组织起来，充分发挥他们各自的特长，以求用最少的人力，取得最大的经济效果。川沙县张江公社瞿家生产队，把九个捕鱼能手组织起来，大搞捕捞，仅用了两天时间，就捕到了河鲜六百多斤。
