Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 28th - According to a broadcast from Vientiane Radio today: Fighting between the Lao Royal Government forces and the Phoumi Nosavan group is still ongoing in North Kading. Twelve soldiers from the Phoumi Nosavan group were killed, and the rest retreated south.

Another broadcast from the Lao Patriotic Forces Radio on the 27th stated: Under the command of Captain Kong Le, the Lao Royal Government forces launched a counter-attack on November 18th and 23rd against the rebel troops of the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak traitorous group stationed in two villages south of North Kading, causing the rebels to flee in panic.

The broadcast stated that the government forces are now calling on those troops who were forced by the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous group to attack Vientiane to surrender to Prince Souvanna Phouma's government, not to carry out the orders of the traitorous group, and to cooperate with the government forces and the Lao Patriotic Forces to jointly oppose the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous group.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 29th - According to a broadcast from the Lao Patriotic Forces Radio on the 28th: The struggle of the people in Lower Laos against the intervention of U.S. imperialism and against the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak traitorous group is developing daily.

The broadcast said that in early and late October, people in Lao Ngam District, Khong Sedone District, Saravane District, Ta Oy District, Pakse District, Champasak District, Paksong District, and Attapeu successively held rallies, distributed leaflets, and posted slogans, accusing U.S. imperialism of intervention and the Phoumi-Boun Oum group of treasonous crimes, while unanimously supporting Prince Souvanna Phouma's legal government. More than 15,000 people participated in these rallies.

The broadcast said that the masses, civil servants, troops, police, students, etc. in Pakse and Savannakhet, which are occupied by the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous group, also expressed great indignation at the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous group's crimes of selling out the country and harming the people. They are waiting for an opportunity to overthrow the traitorous group. Young people in various villages in these two regions are determined to oppose the Phoumi-Boun Oum group's crime of forcibly conscripting young people, and have organized armed teams to counter the "sweeping" operations and defend their villages.

The broadcast said that the people's armed forces also launched counterattacks against the rebels during this period. On November 17th, when a company of rebel troops from Saravane Province was conducting a "sweeping" operation in the Sen Luang area, they were intercepted by the people's armed forces. Eight rebel soldiers were killed, seven were captured, and some were wounded. The rebels were forced to abandon the Sen Luang stronghold and flee, leaving behind a large number of weapons and military supplies. In addition, in order to prevent the rebels from attacking Vientiane and persecuting the people, the people's armed forces destroyed two bridges in the Paksong area on November 12th.

Furthermore, according to today's broadcast from the Lao Patriotic Forces Radio, from August to mid-November this year, the people of Khammouane Province in central Laos, together with their armed forces, carried out twenty anti-"sweeping" operations in some areas, killing twenty-eight Phoumi Nosavan rebels, seizing eighteen guns, and forcing the rebels to withdraw from two strongholds.
