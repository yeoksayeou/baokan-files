    Wang Zhenshan's Mobile Toilet
    Wang Zhenshan, an old commune member of our commune, has created the experience of building mobile toilets for fertilizer accumulation.
    Wang Zhenshan is sixty-nine years old this year and is a fertilizer accumulation model in the Nanguan Production Brigade. Since the implementation of the policy of "vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain," he has become more deeply aware of the importance of accumulating more fertilizer, and his enthusiasm for accumulating fertilizer has increased. He thought, "Factories and shops are all engaged in technological innovation, can't fertilizer accumulation also be technologically innovated?" One day, Wang Zhenshan met Xiao Chen, a shop assistant in a store. He asked Xiao Chen where he was going. Xiao Chen said, "The branch secretary said yesterday that we are digging lotus roots and fishing at Nanda Pit, where there are many people, so I'm going there to sell goods!" Xiao Chen's words greatly inspired Wang Zhenshan. He followed Xiao Chen to Nanda Pit and saw that there were many people working, but there were no toilets nearby, and they had to run to a distant ditch to urinate and defecate. Wang Zhenshan thought, wouldn't it be possible to accumulate a large amount of fertilizer by building a toilet here? However, the work here will be finished in two or three days, and building a toilet with mud walls would be time-consuming and slow. So he used reeds to weave curtains and built a temporary toilet. That night, Wang Zhenshan wove six or seven reed curtains, and the next day a temporary toilet for men and women appeared on the construction site.
    People who had finished working at Nanda Pit came to Xiwu Pit to cut reeds, and as soon as they arrived, they saw that the toilet had already been built.
    Every day, Wang Zhenshan asked the Party branch secretary or the captain where there were many people working, and he would build a toilet there. In November alone, Wang Zhenshan's mobile toilets accumulated more than 17,000 jin of fertilizer.

    王振山的流动厕所
    我们公社的老社员王振山创造了建立流动厕所积肥的经验。
    王振山今年六十九岁，是南关生产大队的积肥模范。自从贯彻“大办农业、大办粮食”的方针以后，他对多积肥料的重要意义认识得更加深刻，积肥的劲头更大了。他想：“工厂、商店都闹技术革新，难道积肥不能闹技术革新吗？”一天，王振山遇到商店售货员小陈，他问小陈到哪里去，小陈说：“昨天支部书记说南大坑挖藕捕鱼，那里人多，到那里售货去！”小陈这句话给王振山很大启发，他随小陈来到南大坑一看，干活的人很多，但是近处没有厕所，大、小便都得跑到老远的沟里去。王振山想，在这里修个厕所不就可以大量积肥吗？可是，这里的活再干两、三天就完了，用泥垛墙修厕所又费工又慢。他就用苇子编成帘，搭了个临时厕所。当晚王振山编好了六、七个苇帘子，第二天工地上出现了男女分用的临时厕所。
    在南大坑干完了活的人们，又来到西苇坑割苇子，人们一到就看见厕所已经搭好了。
    王振山每天向党支部书记或队长询问那里干活的人多，他就在那里搭起厕所。11月份仅王振山的流动厕所这一项就积肥一万七千多斤。
