Revolutionary Bridge
    ——Poems from My Hometown
    Li Xue'ao
Crossing the stone bridge, the water rushes and the waves surge.
Looking towards the village entrance, I smile in my heart,
Hometown, your son has returned!
I was not yet fourteen when I left,
Returning, I have grown to five feet tall.
I stroke the bridge railing and take a look,
Seeing its familiar, true face from back then—
This is a revolutionary bridge,
Having experienced the great revolutionary storm.
Generals watered their horses at the bridgehead,
Soldiers splashed water and sharpened their swords.
Struggle meetings were held at the bridgehead,
Landlords and bullies were overthrown.
Thousands of young people went to the front lines,
The sound of the march echoed from the bridgehead.
Yellow millet was transported over the bridge,
Rifles overwhelmed rocket launchers.
Flag bearers walked across the bridge,
Red flags from all over the world fluttered.
How many people crossed the bridge to Beijing,
To report to their dearest loved ones.
How many people returned home with hoes in hand,
To depict a new look for the mountainous area.
Stone bridge, oh stone bridge,
A bright path on the revolutionary road,
The clear water under the bridge flows endlessly,
The travelers on the bridge will never grow old!

    革命桥
    ——故乡诗抄
    李学鳌跨上石头桥，水急浪滔滔。眼望村口心里笑，故乡啊，你的儿子回来了！别时不满十四岁，归来长成五尺高。手抚桥栏看一看，熟视当年真面貌——这是一座革命桥，身经革命大风暴。将军桥头饮过马，战士撩水磨过刀。桥头开过斗争会，地主恶霸被打倒。千百青年上前线，桥头响起进军号。桥上运过黄小米，步枪压倒火箭炮。桥上走过举旗人，五湖四海红旗飘。多少人过桥去北京，向最亲的亲人做汇报。多少人握锄回乡来，描绘山区新面貌。石头桥啊，石头桥，革命路上阳关道，桥下清水流不断，桥上行人永不老！
