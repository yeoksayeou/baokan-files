Xinhua News Agency, 26th: People from all walks of life in the capital held a grand meeting this afternoon in the CPPCC Auditorium to commemorate the 150th Anniversary of the Latin American Countries' Struggle for National Independence and to celebrate the Second Anniversary of the Cuban Revolution's Victory.

Today's meeting strongly demonstrated the profound friendship between the Chinese people and the people of Latin American countries. The telegram passed at the meeting stated: "In the common struggle against US imperialism, the Chinese people and the people of Latin American countries have always cared for and supported each other. The Chinese people have firmly supported, do now, and will continue to firmly support the struggle of the people of Latin American countries against imperialism, for national independence, and for democratic freedom."

Vice Premiers of the State Council Luo Ruiqing and Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC Burhan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace Liao Chengzhi, and President of the China-Latin America Friendship Association Chu Tunan attended the meeting.

Invited to participate in the meeting were Cuban Ambassador to China Oscar Pino Santos, and foreign guests from Latin American countries such as Cuba, Brazil, Haiti, Bolivia, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Argentina, and Colombia who are currently visiting our country. When the responsible persons from various aspects of our country and the foreign guests stepped onto the rostrum, warm applause broke out in the hall, which was decorated with banners reading "Long Live the Victory of the National Democratic Revolution of Latin American Countries!" and "Long Live the Friendly Solidarity of the Chinese and Latin American Peoples!"

After Zhou Erfu, Vice President of the China-Latin America Friendship Association and host of the meeting, delivered the opening remarks, Chu Tunan delivered a long speech (full text on page 4). He first expressed his highest respect and warmest congratulations to the people of Latin American countries with their glorious revolutionary traditions, and to the heroic Cuban people who are resolutely fighting against US imperialism.

Chu Tunan emphasized that US imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese people, the people of Latin American countries, and the people of the world. The Chinese people will always support the just struggle of the people of Latin American countries and regard it as their unshirkable international responsibility. These remarks of his aroused a burst of warm applause.

In his speech, Chu Tunan introduced the history of the Latin American people's resistance against Spanish and Portuguese colonial rule and their struggle for national independence. He said that after the people of Latin American countries drove out the Spanish and Portuguese colonialists from their own land, they encountered other European invaders and the intrusion of US imperialism. He pointed out that the intrusion of US imperialism, in particular, has brought new disasters to the people of Latin American countries.

Chu Tunan praised the Latin American people for their continuous and heroic struggle against US imperialism for nearly a century. He particularly pointed out that the Cuban people, under the leadership of the Cuban Revolutionary Government headed by Prime Minister Castro, have achieved a great victory in the national democratic revolution, thereby advancing the anti-imperialist struggle of the Latin American people to a new stage, setting a brilliant example for the Latin American people's struggle against US imperialism, and making a great contribution to the struggle of the world's people against US imperialism's policies of aggression and war, and to defending world peace.

Chu Tunan said that in today's excellent international situation where the East wind continues to prevail over the West wind, as long as the people of Latin American countries strengthen their unity and persist in their struggle, the US imperialist policies of aggression and war will surely be completely defeated. US imperialism will certainly not escape the shameful path of failure taken by Spanish and Portuguese colonialism in Latin American countries. The just struggle of the people of Latin American countries will surely be victorious in the end, and a new, independent, free, democratic, and happy Latin America will surely be born from the flames of struggle.

Cuban Ambassador to China Oscar Pino Santos said in his speech (full text on page 4) that he first thanked the Chinese and Latin American friends who attended the meeting. Ambassador Pino Santos pointed out that the struggle in the early part of the last century was a struggle against Spanish colonial rule, and the struggle in this century is a struggle against US imperialist aggression. The victory in the early part of the last century was the victory of the first independence, and the victory in this century will be the victory of the second independence of Latin America—the independence achieved by shaking off the oppression of American financial capitalism.

The ambassador introduced the history of the Cuban and Latin American people's struggle for national independence. He emphasized that the Latin American people are carrying out a new anti-colonialist struggle in this century, which is the struggle against US imperialism, and the struggle for the second independence of Latin America.

The ambassador severely condemned the American colonialists for trying to eliminate the Cuban Revolution. He said that eliminating the Cuban Revolution would be eliminating the example of struggle and victory that the Latin American people admire and support.

The ambassador finally resolutely stated: "The American colonialists cannot stop the Latin American people from seeing this example. Nor can they stop them from inheriting this example." He concluded by shouting: "The people of all the colonies in the world will surely get rid of imperialism!" "Long live the people fighting anti-colonialism!" These remarks of his were warmly applauded by the entire audience.

Haitian poet René Depestre enthusiastically praised the friendship between the people of Latin American countries and the Chinese people in his speech. He said that today we can happily say that the friendship that links China and the whole of Latin America is as broad and deep as the ocean that geographically separates them. René Depestre said that today what US imperialism faces is not only the Cuban people, but 200 million Latin Americans, because they regard the Cuban Revolution as the realization of their national aspirations and as their own verdant spring. Millions upon millions of oppressed Indians, blacks, and whites have risen up to support the Cuban Revolution. It is precisely for this reason that attempts by imperialism to use Latin American countries to implement a policy of military aggression against Cuba have been repeatedly frustrated. He also pointed out that the road of struggle is still arduous, and the Cuban people and the people of other Latin American countries still need to further enhance their ideological and political unity. Great and magnificent struggles await our people. He said that today's international situation is favorable to our anti-imperialist struggle. The forces of democracy and peace throughout the world are on our side. This is the profound and historical truth of the era in which we live. Therefore, our struggle is invincible in the world.

General Secretary of the Argentine University Federation Alhai Whiskind said in his speech that today we can celebrate with great pleasure the victory of a truly anti-imperialist national and people's revolution, which is the victory of the heroic Cuban people. For the first time, we share in the joy of this free, fully self-determined, and unexploited people. At the same time, we also have an unshirkable obligation to be vigilant day and night with the Cuban people against any despicable and shameless aggression by US imperialism. Whiskind pointed out that defending the Cuban Revolution is the current slogan of Latin American students, and we know how to fulfill the responsibility of this slogan. He said that if Wall Street imperialism attempts to invade Cuba, it will anger the entire Americas. Whiskind said that our people are participating in the ranks of the struggle against imperialism with increasing confidence. We know that we are not isolated, and we see that every step forward in the struggle and progress made by New China is a victory and encouragement for us. Because the aspirations of the Chinese people are also our aspirations.

All the speeches at the meeting were constantly interrupted by warm applause. After the speeches, the meeting passed a telegram expressing heartfelt congratulations to the people of Latin America and the heroic Cuban people.

Also attending today's meeting were: Vice Presidents of the China-Latin America Friendship Association Yao Zhen and Dong Chuncai, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Ding Xilin, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Xu Zhizhen, Vice Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation Zhang Chao, Vice Chairman of the National Women's Federation Xu Guangping, Vice Mayor of Beijing Wu Han, and people from all walks of life in Beijing.

Friends from Latin American countries in Beijing were invited to participate in the meeting.

After the meeting, artists from the capital performed song and dance programs. (Attached pictures)

    据新华社26日讯　首都各界人民今天下午在政协礼堂隆重集会，纪念拉丁美洲各国争取民族独立一百五十周年和庆祝古巴革命胜利二周年。
    今天的大会强烈显示了中国人民和拉丁美洲各国人民的深厚友谊。大会通过的电文中说：“在反对美帝国主义共同的斗争中，中国人民和拉丁美洲各国人民一直是互相关怀、互相支持的。中国人民过去、现在和将来都坚决支持拉丁美洲各国人民的反对帝国主义，维护民族独立，争取民主自由的斗争。”
    国务院副总理罗瑞卿、习仲勋，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长林枫，政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉，外交部副部长章汉夫，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席廖承志，中国拉丁美洲友好协会会长楚图南出席了大会。
    应邀参加大会的，有古巴驻中国大使奥斯卡·皮诺·桑托斯，正在我国访问的古巴、巴西、海地、玻利维亚、巴拿马、多米尼加、阿根廷、哥伦比亚等拉丁美洲国家的外宾。当我国各方面的负责人和外宾们走上主席台的时候，在悬挂着“拉丁美洲各国民族民主革命胜利万岁！”“中国和拉丁美洲各国人民的友好团结万岁！”标语的会场上，响起了热烈掌声。
    大会主持人、中国拉丁美洲友好协会副会长周而复致开会词以后，楚图南接着发表了长篇讲话（全文见第四版）。他首先向有着光荣革命传统的拉丁美洲各国人民，向坚决进行反对美帝国主义斗争的英雄的古巴人民，表示崇高的敬意和热烈的祝贺。
    楚图南强调指出，美帝国主义是中国人民、拉丁美洲各国人民和全世界人民的共同敌人。中国人民将永远支持拉丁美洲各国人民的正义斗争，并把它看做是自己的义不容辞的国际责任。他的这些讲话激起了一片热烈的欢迎掌声。
    楚图南在讲话中介绍了拉丁美洲各国人民反抗西班牙和葡萄牙殖民统治、争取民族独立的历史。他说，拉丁美洲各国人民在自己的土地上赶走西班牙和葡萄牙殖民者之后，又遇到了欧洲的另外一些侵略者和美帝国主义的侵入。他指出，特别是美帝国主义的侵入，给拉丁美洲各国人民带来了新的灾难。
    楚图南赞扬拉丁美洲各国人民近百年来对美帝国主义开展了持续不断的英勇斗争。他特别指出，古巴人民在以卡斯特罗总理为首的古巴革命政府的领导下，取得了民族民主革命的伟大胜利，从而把拉丁美洲各国人民反帝斗争推进到一个新的阶段，为拉丁美洲各国人民反对美帝国主义的斗争树立了光辉的榜样，对世界人民反对美帝国主义的侵略政策、战争政策，保卫世界和平的斗争作出了巨大贡献。
    楚图南说，在今天东风继续压倒西风的大好国际形势下，只要拉丁美洲各国人民加强团结，坚持斗争，美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策必将彻底失败。美帝国主义一定逃不出西班牙和葡萄牙殖民主义者在拉丁美洲各国所走的可耻的失败道路。拉丁美洲各国人民的正义斗争必将最后胜利，新的独立自由、民主幸福的拉丁美洲一定将从斗争的烈火中诞生。
    古巴驻中国大使奥斯卡·皮诺·桑托斯在讲话
  （全文见第四版）中，首先对参加大会的中国、拉丁美洲的朋友们表示感谢。皮诺·桑托斯大使指出，上世纪初叶的斗争是反对西班牙殖民统治的斗争，这个世纪的斗争是反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争。上世纪初叶的胜利是第一次获得独立的胜利，这个世纪的胜利，将是拉丁美洲第二次独立——摆脱美国金融资本主义压迫而取得独立的胜利。
    大使介绍了古巴和拉丁美洲人民争取民族独立的斗争历史。他强调说，拉丁美洲人民在本世纪进行了一个新的反殖民主义的斗争，就是反对美帝国主义的斗争，是争取拉丁美洲第二次独立的斗争。
    大使严厉谴责美国殖民者想消灭古巴革命。他说，因为消灭古巴革命，就是消灭拉丁美洲人民钦佩和支持的斗争和胜利的榜样。
    大使最后坚决表示：“美国殖民者是阻挡不了拉丁美洲人民看到这个榜样的。也阻挡不了他们继承这个榜样的。”他最后高呼：“全世界殖民地的人民一定会摆脱帝国主义”，“反殖民主义斗争的人民万岁！”他的这些讲话受到了全场热烈的鼓掌欢迎。
    海地诗人莱乃·德贝斯特莱在讲话中热情颂扬拉丁美洲各国人民和中国人民之间的友谊。他说，今天我们可以愉快地讲，把中国和整个拉丁美洲联结在一起的友谊，就像在地理上横隔于他们之间的海洋一样广阔和深厚。莱乃·德贝斯特莱说，今天美帝国主义所面临的不仅是古巴人，而是两亿拉丁美洲人，因为他们把古巴革命看成自己民族愿望的实现，看成自己的青翠的春天。千千万万受压迫的印第安人、黑人和白人，群起支持古巴革命。正因为如此，帝国主义利用拉丁美洲国家实行反对古巴的军事侵略政策的尝试，一直遭到了失败。他还指出，斗争的道路还是艰苦的，古巴人民和其他拉丁美洲国家的人民还需要进一步提高团结的思想性和政治性，伟大而壮丽的斗争等待着我们的人民。他说，今天的国际形势有利于我们的反帝斗争。全世界民主、和平的力量是在我们这一边的。这是我们所处的时代的深刻的历史性的真理。因此，我们的斗争是世界上无往而不胜的。
    阿根廷大学联合会总书记阿尔亥·威斯金德在讲话中说，今天我们能以非常愉快的心情来庆祝一个真正反帝的民族和人民革命的胜利，这就是英雄的古巴人民的胜利。我们第一次分享到这个自由的、有完全自决权的、不受剥削的人民的快乐。同时，我们也有不可推卸的义务，和古巴人民一起，日日夜夜警惕美帝国主义任何卑鄙无耻的侵略。威斯金德指出，保卫古巴的革命就是拉丁美洲学生目前的口号，我们知道怎样去实现这个口号的责任。他说，如果华尔街的帝国主义企图侵略古巴，那将触怒整个美洲。威斯金德说，我们的人民越来越有信心地参加到反对帝国主义的斗争行列。我们知道，我们不是孤立的，我们看到新中国所作的斗争和前进中的每一步伐，这对我们来说，都是一个胜利和鼓舞。因为中国人民的愿望也就是我们的愿望。
    大会上的所有讲话，都不断为热烈的掌声所打断。讲话以后，大会通过电文，向拉丁美洲人民和英雄的古巴人民表示衷心的祝贺。
    参加今天大会的还有：中国拉丁美洲友好协会副会长姚溱、董纯才，中国人民对外文化协会副会长丁西林，中华全国总工会副主席许之桢，中华全国青年联合会副主席张超，全国妇联副主席许广平，北京市副市长吴晗以及北京各方面人士。
