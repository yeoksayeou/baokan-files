Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, December 28th. Xinhua News Agency correspondent in Belgrade, Ding Man, was suddenly attacked on the morning of December 15th while en route to Novi Sad, Yugoslavia, on official business. Zhou Qiuye, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of our embassy in Yugoslavia, lodged a strong protest with the Secretariat of State for Foreign Affairs of the Federal Executive Council of Yugoslavia on the afternoon of December 26th regarding this incident and submitted a memorandum.

Chargé d'Affaires ad interim Zhou Qiuye read out the memorandum during a meeting with Zarkovic, Director of the First Department of the Yugoslav Secretariat of State for Foreign Affairs.

The memorandum from the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia stated: "On December 15, 1960, Ding Man, correspondent of the Xinhua News Agency of the People's Republic of China stationed in Belgrade, at the invitation of the Press Secretariat of the Federal Executive Council of Yugoslavia and the Acting General Manager of the Novi Sad Fair, traveled by car to Novi Sad to attend a press conference held by Dušan Bogdanov, Chairman of the Economic Committee of the Executive Council of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, and a discussion and cocktail party for the press representatives with Acting General Manager Jurij Drasinovil for the 28th International Agricultural Fair. At 11:30 a.m. (local time), when the car was in the vicinity of Novi Sad, he was suddenly attacked, and the front windshield of the car was hit by a bullet. Ding Man immediately informed the traffic police and the Secretariat of Internal Affairs of Novi Sad, and the Secretariat of Internal Affairs sent people to investigate, who clearly saw the fact that the car window was hit. On December 16, Ding Man informed the Press Secretariat of the Federal Executive Council of this matter, which promised to respond, but has not yet done so. Obviously, the Yugoslav government authorities have not given due attention to this serious incident."

The memorandum emphasized: "This attack on a Xinhua News Agency reporter while on official business is by no means an accidental event. It is a serious development in a series of incidents in which the Yugoslav side has been hostile to Xinhua News Agency reporters for a long time. After being subjected to discrimination, restrictions, and open personal attacks by the Yugoslav side, the personal safety of Xinhua News Agency reporters is now threatened."

The memorandum concluded: "The Chinese Embassy cannot but lodge a strong protest with the Secretariat of State for Foreign Affairs, demanding that the relevant Yugoslav authorities investigate the perpetrators and take effective measures to ensure the safety of Xinhua News Agency reporters and prevent similar incidents from occurring."

After listening to Chargé d'Affaires ad interim Zhou Qiuye read out the memorandum, Zarkovic immediately tried to shirk the responsibility that the Yugoslav authorities should bear for this serious incident and quibbled. He stubbornly insisted that this incident should not be linked to the Yugoslav government's attitude towards Xinhua News Agency reporters, and he expressed his "most resolute rejection" of the part of the memorandum that mentioned this connection. He also slandered that the solemn protest lodged by our embassy was "deliberately deteriorating relations between the two countries" and made personal attacks on Chargé d'Affaires ad interim Zhou.

Chargé d'Affaires ad interim Zhou refuted Zarkovic's quibbles and slanders on the spot with strong words and insisted on the protest.

However, Zarkovic had to accept the memorandum and stated that he "will investigate this matter with all seriousness."

    我临时代办向南斯拉夫当局递交备忘录
    严重抗议袭击新华社记者事件
    要求查究肇事者并采取措施防止类似事件发生
    新华社贝尔格莱德28日电　新华社驻贝尔格莱德记者丁曼12月15日上午在赴南斯拉夫诺维萨特市执行公务途中，遭到突然袭击。我国驻南斯拉夫大使馆临时代办周秋野于12月26日下午就此事件向南斯拉夫联邦执行委员会外交国务秘书处提出了严重抗议并递交了备忘录。
    周秋野代办在会见南斯拉夫外交国务秘书处第一司司长扎尔科维奇时宣读了这一备忘录。
    我国驻南斯拉夫大使馆的备忘录说：“1960年12月15日，中华人民共和国新华社驻贝尔格莱德记者丁曼，应南斯拉夫联邦执行委员会新闻秘书处和诺维萨特博览会代理总经理的邀请，乘坐汽车前往诺维萨特参加伏伊伏丁那自治省执行委员会经济委员会主席杜山·博格达诺夫举行的记者招待会和尤里耶·德拉西诺维尔代理总经理为第二十八届国际农业博览会同新闻界代表的谈话和酒会。在上午十一时三十分（当地时间），当车行至诺维萨特市近郊时，他遭到突然袭击，汽车的前窗玻璃被枪弹击中。丁曼随即将此事通知了诺维萨特市的路警和内务秘书处，该市内务秘书处派人进行了调查，他们清楚地看到了汽车玻璃被击中的事实。12月16日，丁曼又将此事通知了联邦执行委员会新闻秘书处，该处曾允给予答复，但至今并未答复。显然，南斯拉夫政府当局至今未对此严重事件给以应有的注意。”
    备忘录强调指出：“这次新华社记者在执行公务途中遭受袭击，决不是一个偶然事件，它是长期以来南斯拉夫方面一系列敌视新华社记者事件的严重发展。新华社记者在受到南斯拉夫方面的歧视、限制和公开的人身攻击之后，现在生命安全已经受到威胁。”
    备忘录最后说：“中国大使馆对此不能不向外交国务秘书处提出严重抗议，要求南斯拉夫有关当局查究肇事者，并采取有效措施，保证新华社记者的生命安全，防止类似事件发生。”
    扎尔科维奇在听完周秋野代办宣读了这份备忘录后当场力图推卸南斯拉夫当局对此严重事件所应负的责任并进行狡辩。他硬说，不应该将此事件与南斯拉夫政府对新华社记者的态度相联系，他并表示“最坚决地拒绝”备忘录中提及此一联系的部分。他还诬蔑说我大使馆提出的严正抗议是“故意恶化两国关系”，并对周代办进行人身攻击。
    周代办对扎尔科维奇的狡辩和诬蔑当场一一加以严词驳斥并坚持了抗议。
    但是，扎尔科维奇不得不接受备忘录，并表示“将以一切严肃性来调查此事”。
