    Hefei, December 6th (This newspaper reports) The CCP Ma'anshan Municipal Committee has tightly grasped the three key areas of ore production, transportation, and mechanical equipment maintenance and repair, enabling steel production to steadily increase continuously. By November 25th, the pig iron production of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company had increased by more than 42% compared to last year's actual performance.

    Since September, the steel production of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company has shown the following characteristics: First, a substantial increase in ore production has promoted an overall increase in iron, steel, and steel products. Since October, the amount of ore processing has increased by nearly two times compared to before September. The average daily output of iron, steel, and steel products increased by 14%, 86.5%, and 48.05% respectively, compared to the average daily output from January to August. Second, thanks to the sufficient supply of ore and the safe operation of mechanical equipment, steel production has steadily and continuously increased without significant fluctuations. Third, since September, basically no new production equipment has been added, mainly relying on fully utilizing the potential of existing smelting equipment; not only have no new workers been added, but a group of workers has been drawn out to support other enterprises. Fourth, production order is normal, and there has been no temporary rush. Employees are able to work and rest, are full of energy, and have high morale.

    After several years of continuous leaps forward, Ma'anshan Iron and Steel's pig iron production has greatly increased. This requires greater development in raw material production. The CCP Ma'anshan Municipal Committee has deeply felt from production practice that ore and other raw materials are the foundation of steel production, and the quantity and quality of ore directly affect the production of blast furnaces. With a sufficient supply of ore, a substantial increase in steel production can be reliably guaranteed. To this end, the CCP Ma'anshan Municipal Committee has adopted the method of concentrating superior forces to fight annihilation battles, focusing on the production and construction of mines. Starting in April this year, Huang Yu, Director of the Industrial Department of the CCP Anhui Provincial Committee, Wei Anmin, Secretary of the CCP Ma'anshan Municipal Committee, and Ni Hengzhong, Deputy Secretary, respectively led a group of mechanical repair, installation, power, transportation, material supply, and civil engineering forces to set up camp and command operations in the three large mines of Nanshan, Gushan, and Taochong. After three or four months of efforts, each mine has newly installed five ore crushing and screening machines, and built four large ore storage tanks, increasing the ore crushing and processing capacity of the mines by nearly two times compared to before, and greatly improving the qualification rate of ore, basically meeting the needs of blast furnace production. After the ore storage tanks were put into production, the ore storage capacity increased by 67% compared to before, basically achieving "five days of no production in the mine does not affect transportation, and five days of no transportation does not affect mine production." All steel plants have also actively improved raw material yards, adopted both indigenous and foreign methods, and vigorously carried out reforms of loading and unloading tools, increasing unloading efficiency by more than double compared to before. Due to the improvement of loading and unloading efficiency, the turnaround time of vehicles was shortened, increasing the turnover rate of trains from 1.17 times to 1.53 times. This greatly tapped the potential of existing transportation equipment and improved transportation capacity. The company's train transportation volume of ore in the second quarter increased by more than 64% compared to the first quarter, and in October it increased by 17% compared to September.

    After the problems of ore processing and transportation were gradually solved, the CCP Ma'anshan Municipal Committee further strengthened its leadership in equipment maintenance and repair and spare parts manufacturing. The Municipal Committee organized all mechanical manufacturing and repair forces in the city, mobilized employees to engage in technical innovation and technical revolution, and vigorously carried out the manufacturing of spare parts, greatly increasing the quantity of spare parts. Since August, the monthly production of spare parts by the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel General Repair Plant alone has increased by more than 41% compared to the average monthly output from January to July. Through vigorously engaging in technical innovation and technical revolution, the employees of the mechanical repair workshop of the No. 1 Ironmaking Plant can now manufacture 85% of the spare parts for the blast furnace system themselves. Now, for all spare parts that this plant can manufacture itself, it generally reserves one or two sets, achieving repairs as soon as damage occurs. At the same time, all factories and mines have implemented the policy of "prevention first, maintenance second," strengthened employees' education in technical operating procedures, and regularly carried out mass anti-accident struggles to plug loopholes in man-made accidents. In order to strengthen the leadership of spare parts manufacturing and equipment maintenance and repair, all factories, mines, workshops, and work sections have been equipped with deputy factory directors, deputy directors, and equipment officers for equipment. After these measures were taken, equipment accidents in all factories and mines were greatly reduced, and the operating rate of mechanical equipment was improved.

    After grasping the above three weak links, the CCP Ma'anshan Municipal Committee drove the all-round leap forward in steel production. With sufficient conditions for increasing production, the employees of all steel plants more actively and proactively launched red banner emulation campaigns. The main leaders of the Municipal Committee and the leading cadres at all levels of the company spent 80% of their time going deep into the grassroots, organizing "pace-setter competitions," "opponent competitions," "short-distance evaluations," and "linked large-scale collaboration competitions," etc., so that the level of individual advanced individuals quickly became the universal level of the enterprise.

    抓住矿石、运输、机械维修三大关键集中力量逐个解决
    马钢钢铁产量稳步上升
    本报合肥6日电　中共马鞍山市委紧紧抓住矿石生产、运输和机械设备维护检修三大关键，使钢铁产量持续稳步上升。到11月25日，马鞍山钢铁公司的生铁产量比去年的实绩增长了42％以上。
    9月份以来，马鞍山钢铁公司的钢铁生产出现了下面的一些特点：一、矿石生产大幅度的增长，促进了铁、钢、钢材全面增长。10月份以来，矿石生产的加工量比9月前增加了将近两倍。铁、钢、钢材的平均日产量，和1至8月的平均日产量比较，分别增长了14％、86.5％、48.05％。二、由于矿石供应充分，机械设备安全运转，钢铁产量稳步持续上升，没有忽高忽低的波动。三、9月份以来基本上没有增加新的生产设备，主要靠充分发挥现有冶炼设备的潜力；不仅没有增加新工人，而且抽出了一批工人支援了其他企业。四、生产秩序正常，没有出现临时突击现象。职工有劳有逸，精力充沛，情绪饱满。
    经过几年的连续跃进，马钢的生铁产量大大提高了。这就要求原料生产有更大的发展。中共马鞍山市委从生产实践中深深感到：矿石等原料是钢铁生产的基础，矿石的产量和质量直接影响到高炉的生产，有了充足的矿石供应，钢铁生产大幅度增长才有可靠的保证。为此，中共马鞍山市委采取集中优势兵力打歼灭战的办法，狠抓矿山的生产建设工作。从今年4月起，中共安徽省委工业部长黄驭、中共马鞍山市委书记魏安民和副书记倪恒忠等负责同志，分别率领一批机修、安装、动力、运输、材料供应、土木建筑力量，分别深入到南山、姑山、桃冲三个大型矿山安营扎寨，坐镇指挥。经过三、四个月的努力，各矿山就新安装起五台矿石破碎筛选机，建设起四个大型储矿槽，使矿山矿石破碎的加工能力比原来增加了将近两倍，而且矿石的合格率大大提高，基本上满足了高炉生产的需要。储矿槽投入生产后，储矿能力比原来增长了67％。基本上做到了“矿山五天不生产不影响运输，五天不运输不影响矿山生产。”各个钢铁厂也都积极改善原料场地，采取土洋并举的办法，大搞装卸工具改革，使卸车效率比原来提高一倍多。由于装卸效率的提高，缩短了车辆的停留时间，使火车的周转率由原来的一点一七次提高到一点五三次。这样，就大大挖掘了现有运输设备的潜力，提高了运输能力。这个公司第二季度的火车运矿量比第一季度增加了64％以上，10月又比9月份增加了17％。
    矿石加工和运输问题逐步解决后，中共马鞍山市委又进一步加强了对设备维护检修和备品备件制造的领导。市委组织全市所有的机械制造修配力量，发动职工大闹技术革新和技术革命，大搞备品备件的制造，使备品备件的数量大大增加。仅马钢机修总厂8月份以来每月制造的备品备件就比1至7月份每月平均产量增长了41％以上。炼铁一厂机修车间的职工通过大闹技术革新和技术革命，目前高炉系统的备品备件85％都能自己制造。现在，这个厂凡是自己能够制造的备品备件，一般都储备了一套到两套，做到了随坏随修。同时，各厂矿还贯彻了“以预防为主，检修为辅”的方针，加强职工的技术操作规程教育，定期开展群众性的反事故斗争，堵塞人为事故的漏洞。为了加强对备品备件制造和设备维护检修的领导，各厂矿、车间、工段都配备了设备副厂长、设备副主任和设备员。采取这些措施后，各厂矿的设备事故大大减少，机械设备的作业率提高了。
    中共马鞍山市委抓住了上述三个薄弱环节以后，带动了钢铁生产的全面跃进。各钢铁厂的职工有了充分的增产条件后，更加主动积极地全面开展了红旗竞赛运动。市委的主要负责人和公司的各级领导干部都以80％的时间，深入基层，组织“标兵赛”、“对手赛”、“短距离评比”和“连环大协作赛”等使个别先进的水平很快地变成企业普遍的水平。
