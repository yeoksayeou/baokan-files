Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 8th: The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement today pointing out that the newly formed Second Ikeda Cabinet will pursue policies that serve the interests of aggressive U.S. imperialism, intensify the exploitation of the Japanese working people, and revive Japanese imperialism.

The statement said: "The Ikeda Cabinet and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's anti-national and anti-democratic nature were clearly exposed when the ruling party forced the notorious Kiyose to serve as Speaker of the House of Representatives. We remember very well that it was this Kiyose who, as Speaker of the House of Representatives, violated the will of the majority of the Japanese people and helped the Liberal Democratic Party forcibly pass the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty in the Diet."

The statement pointed out: The dollar crisis is shaking the foundation of the Ikeda Cabinet's domestic and foreign policies.

The statement said: "We announce that we will continue to work to abolish the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, defeat the undemocratic policies of the Ikeda Cabinet, and restore Japan-China diplomatic relations."

Kiyokazu Katsumada, Director of the Education and Propaganda Bureau of the Japan Socialist Party, said in a statement today that the Second Ikeda Cabinet "has not changed its policy of following the United States," and that people "cannot see any concern for the lives of the people." He said, "Ikeda was clumsy in the re-election of the Speaker, thus revealing that his cabinet is unstable." He said that the factional struggles within the Liberal Democratic Party "will become more intense in the future."

According to radio reports, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan believes that although the Ikeda Cabinet promotes the "double income" plan, it will strengthen labor intensity and massively lay off workers in the name of "trade liberalization" and "enterprise rationalization" in the future. Therefore, the General Council of Trade Unions is prepared to fight resolutely against the Ikeda Cabinet.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 10th: Former Japanese Prime Minister Tanzan Ishibashi condemned the newly formed Ikeda Cabinet for pursuing the Yoshida Shigeru line of foreign policy, which makes Japan even more subordinate to the United States. He called for the early restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations.

The veteran Liberal Democratic Party politician pointed out in an article published in the *Hokkaido Shimbun* on the 8th: "Ikeda is carrying out Yoshida-style diplomacy, which I have always opposed. There is no indication that Ikeda has abandoned the policy of unilaterally relying on the United States."

Ishibashi emphasized that Ikeda should change his mind and establish friendly relations with the Soviet Union and China. He also said: "If we consider the fact that Japan is a member of Asian and African countries, we cannot ignore the Socialist Party's view that Japan should establish friendly relations with socialist neighbors." Ishibashi emphasized that not only does he firmly believe that Japan should be friendly with China and the Soviet Union, but most Japanese people also demand it.

The former Prime Minister said that the primary task of the Second Ikeda Cabinet should therefore be to implement a policy of establishing friendly relations with the Soviet Union and China.

He called on the Ikeda Cabinet to take steps to conclude a government-level trade agreement with China and not to be timid towards the United States.

    日本共产党社会党和总评一致指出
    池田新内阁反动政策未变
    石桥谴责池田奉行屈从美国的吉田路线
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央干部会今天发表声明指出：新组成的第二届池田内阁将推行为侵略成性的美帝国主义的利益服务、加紧剥削日本劳动人民群众和复活日本帝国主义的政策。
    声明说：“在执政党自由民主党强使臭名昭彰的清濑充当众议院议长的时候，池田和执政党的反民族和反民主性质就昭然若揭了。我们记得很清楚，正是这个清濑，曾以众议院议长的身份违背大多数日本人民的意志，帮助自由民主党人在国会中强行通过日美军事同盟条约。”
    声明指出：美元危机正动摇着池田内阁的国内外政策的基础。
    声明说：“我们宣布，我们将继续为废除日美军事同盟条约，击退池田内阁不民主的政策以及恢复日中邦交而努力”。
    日本社会党教育宣传局长胜间田清一今天发表谈话指出，第二届池田内阁“没有改变追随美国的方针”，而且人们也“看不出它对国民生活有什么关心”。他说，“池田在改选议长时搞得很笨拙，因而已经暴露出他的内阁是不稳定的”。他说，自由民主党的派系斗争“今后将会更加激烈起来”。
    据电台报道，日本工会总评议会认为，尽管池田内阁宣传要实现“收入增加一倍”的计划，但今后将会用“贸易自由化”、“企业合理化”的名义，加强劳动强度和大量解雇工人。因此，“总评”准备为坚决反对池田内阁而进行斗争。
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本前首相石桥湛山谴责新成立的池田内阁奉行使日本更加从属于美国的吉田茂路线的外交政策。他要求早日恢复日中邦交。
    这位自由民主党老政治家在8日的《北海道新闻》上发表的一篇文章中指出：“池田正在进行吉田式的外交活动，这是我一直反对的，没有迹象表明，池田已经抛弃片面依赖美国的政策。”
    石桥强调说，池田应当改变主意，并且应当同苏联和中国建立友好关系。他并且说：“如果我们考虑到日本是亚非国家的一员这个事实，我们就不能漠视社会党的看法：日本应当同社会主义邻国建立友好关系。”石桥强调说，不仅他本人坚决认为日本应当同中国和苏联友好，而且大多数日本人民也要求这样做。
    这位前首相说，因此，第二届池田内阁的首要任务应当是推行同苏联和中国建立友好关系的政策。
    他要求池田内阁采取步骤同中国缔结政府级贸易协定，而不要对美国采取胆怯的态度。
