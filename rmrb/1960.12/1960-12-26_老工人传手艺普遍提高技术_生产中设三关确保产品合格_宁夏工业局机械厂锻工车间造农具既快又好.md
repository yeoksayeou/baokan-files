Veteran Workers Pass on Skills, Universally Improving Techniques; Three Quality Control Checks in Production Ensure Product Qualification; Forging Workshop of the Ningxia Industrial Bureau Machinery Factory Produces Farm Tools Quickly and Well

    This newspaper reports from Ningxia: The forging workshop of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Industrial Bureau Machinery Factory has fully utilized the role of veteran workers and done everything possible to improve the quality of small farm tools. All the small farm tools leaving the factory this year have been up to standard. By the end of November, the annual production tasks for eight types of small farm tools, including shovels and pickaxes, have been completed or overfulfilled.

    Before August of this year, a few people in the factory believed that the output value of small farm tools was low and the technology was simple, and they did not pay enough attention to the production of small farm tools. The factory Party branch strengthened the education of workers on agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, clarified the relationship between the production of small farm tools and the current large-scale agriculture campaign, and the relationship between quantity and quality. At the same time, in daily production, they often used vivid facts to educate workers to pay attention to the quality of small farm tools. Workers can often pay attention to ensuring and improving the quality of small farm tools.

    This workshop paid attention to the role of veteran workers in the production of small farm tools. From the beginning of this year to October, the workers in the forging workshop attended two hours of technical classes every week, where veteran workers or technicians, combined with the actual production situation, explained the issues that should be paid attention to in the manufacture of small farm tools, lecturing and demonstrating simultaneously. Once, the mouth of a pickaxe forged by worker Li Lu was slightly crooked, but he couldn't see it himself. Yang Shiying, who had been a forger for more than 20 years, noticed the problem and took out the pickaxe during a technical class to tell everyone how to check the quality of the pickaxe and how to prevent the mouth from being crooked. The workers universally improved their technique of forging pickaxes. In daily production, veteran technical workers often pass on their technical experience to others. Seventh-grade forger Wang Fengtong has high skills. The furnace he operates overfulfills the production task every day, and the product quality is also good. The pickaxes forged by Qi Yuanyuan's furnace were not as good as those from Wang Fengtong's furnace. Wang Fengtong told Qi Yuanyuan his tricks for forging pickaxes. Qi Yuanyuan improved the forging tools and quenching process, and soon caught up with Wang Fengtong's furnace in terms of pickaxe quality.

    The forging workshop has also established a series of systems to ensure the quality of small farm tools. After each task is received, they first ask skilled technical workers to produce samples. After the factory department approves them, they ask the user unit to appraise the specifications and quality of the samples. After the user unit is satisfied, the forging workshop uses the samples as the standard and uses the method of fixing personnel, quantity, quality, and materials to implement the production tasks to the furnace and to the individual. From the workshop to the factory, a three-level inspection and acceptance system for product quality has also been established: the group leader checks the quality and specifications of the semi-finished products, and if problems are found, they are remedied in time; after the finished products are forged, the workshop director and veteran forgers check the quality of the finished products, and only those that are qualified are allowed to be put into storage; before the small farm tools leave the factory, leading cadres, forgers, and technicians conduct another inspection together, and those that are unqualified are not allowed to leave the factory.

    老工人传手艺普遍提高技术
    生产中设三关确保产品合格
    宁夏工业局机械厂锻工车间造农具既快又好
    本报讯　据宁夏日报消息：宁夏回族自治区工业局机械厂锻工车间充分发挥老工人的作用，千方百计提高小农具质量，今年出厂的小农具件件合格。到11月底，铁锹、十字镐等八种小农具的全年生产任务已经完成或超额完成。
    今年8月以前，这个厂有少数人认为小农具产值小、技术低，对小农具生产不够重视。工厂党支部对职工加强了农业是国民经济基础的教育，讲清小农具生产和当前大办农业的关系、数量和质量的关系，同时在日常生产中，经常通过活生生的事实，教育工人们重视小农具的质量。工人们对保证和提高小农具质量都能经常注意。
    这个车间在小农具生产中注意发挥了老工人的作用。今年年初到10月份，锻工车间工人每周都上两小时技术课，由老工人或技术员，结合生产实际，讲解制造小农具应该注意的问题，边讲边表演。有一次，工人李禄打的一把十字镐，口子有些偏歪，自己看不出来。干了二十多年锻工活的杨世英看出了这个问题，就在上技术课时，把那把十字镐拿出来，告诉大家怎样检查十字镐质量，以及防止口子偏歪的方法，工人们普遍提高了打十字镐的技术。在日常生产中，老技术工人经常把技术经验传授给别人。七级锻工王凤同手艺高，由他掌钳的烘炉，天天超额完成生产任务，产品质量也好。祁元元掌钳的烘炉，打出的十字镐，不如王凤同烘炉的好。王凤同把自己打十字镐的窍门告诉了祁元元。祁元元改进了锻打工具和焖烧工艺，很快在十字镐质量方面赶上了王凤同烘炉。
    锻工车间还建立了一系列制度，来保证小农具的质量。每次接受任务之后，他们都是先请手艺高的技术工人打出样品，通过厂部，请使用单位鉴定样品的规格、质量。使用单位认为满意后，锻工车间就以样品为标准，用定人员、定数量、定质量、定材料的办法，把生产任务落实到炉、到人。从车间到厂部，还建立了产品质量三级检查验收制度：小组长检查半成品的质量和规格，发现问题，及时补救；打出成品来以后，车间主任和老锻工检查成品质量，合格的才许入库；小农具出厂前，领导干部、锻工和技术员在一起，再进行一次检查，不合格的不让出厂。
