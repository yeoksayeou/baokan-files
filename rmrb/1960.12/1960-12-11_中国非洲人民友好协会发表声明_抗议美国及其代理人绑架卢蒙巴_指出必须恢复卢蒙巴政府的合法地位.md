Xinhua News Agency, December 10th—The China-Africa People's Friendship Association today issued a statement regarding the kidnapping of Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba by U.S. imperialism and its agent, the Mobutu traitorous clique. The full text of the statement is as follows:

Under the direction and support of U.S. imperialism and the "United Nations Force" headquarters it manipulates, the imperialist agent, the Mobutu traitorous clique, outrageously kidnapped Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba by force on December 1st, and subjected him to insults and torture. The China-Africa People's Friendship Association expresses its utmost indignation and strongest protest against this most despicable and shameless barbaric crime committed by U.S. imperialism, the "United Nations Force" headquarters it manipulates, and the Mobutu traitorous clique!

The series of criminal activities carried out by U.S. imperialism in collusion with Belgian colonialists, using the signboard of the United Nations and Congolese national scum, fully exposes the hideous face of U.S. imperialism as a neo-colonialist and its sinister plot to deliberately swallow up the Congo and establish a new American colonial rule there.

The Chinese people resolutely support our government's solemn statement on the situation in the Congo; the imperialist bloc headed by the United States and the "United Nations Force" must immediately stop their aggression and interference in the Congo; they must immediately stop the persecution of Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba, Senate President Okito, and House Speaker Kasongo, and immediately restore their freedom; the legitimate status of the Congolese central government headed by Lumumba must be immediately restored! The 650 million Chinese people resolutely support the Congolese people's patriotic and just struggle against U.S.-led imperialism and its running dogs to safeguard national independence, and express deep sympathy for the persecution suffered by Prime Minister Lumumba and others. The Chinese people firmly believe that as long as the Congolese people unite closely, and with the support of Asian and African countries and all peace-loving countries and people, adhere to a tenacious and arduous just struggle, they will thoroughly defeat all old and new colonialists and achieve final victory.

    中国非洲人民友好协会发表声明
    抗议美国及其代理人绑架卢蒙巴
    指出必须恢复卢蒙巴政府的合法地位
    新华社10日讯　中国非洲人民友好协会今天发表了关于美帝国主义及其代理人蒙博托卖国集团绑架刚果卢蒙巴总理的声明。声明的全文如下：
    在美帝国主义和它所操纵的“联合国军”司令部的指示和支持下，帝国主义的代理人蒙博托卖国集团在12月1日竟悍然武力绑架了刚果总理卢蒙巴，并对他横加侮辱和折磨。中国非洲人民友好协会对美帝国主义和它所操纵的“联合国军”司令部以及蒙博托卖国集团这一最卑鄙无耻的野蛮罪行表示无比的愤慨和最强烈的抗议！
    美帝国主义串通比利时殖民主义者，利用联合国的招牌和刚果的民族败类，在刚果所进行的一系列罪恶活动，充分暴露了美帝国主义这个新殖民主义者的狰狞面目和它蓄意鲸吞刚果，和在刚果建立美国新的殖民统治的罪恶阴谋。
    中国人民坚决拥护我国政府关于刚果局势的庄严声明，以美国为首的帝国主义集团和“联合国军”必须立即停止对刚果的侵略和干涉；必须立即制止对刚果共和国总理卢蒙巴、参议院议长奥基托、众议院议长卡松戈等人的迫害，并立即恢复他们的自由；必须立即恢复以卢蒙巴为首的刚果中央政府的合法地位！六亿五千万中国人民坚决支持刚果人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗、维护民族独立的爱国正义斗争，并对卢蒙巴总理等人所遭受的迫害寄予深切的同情。中国人民坚信，只要刚果人民紧密地团结起来，在亚非国家和一切爱好和平的国家和人民的支持下，坚持顽强而艰巨的正义斗争，必将彻底战胜一切新老殖民主义者，取得最后的胜利。
