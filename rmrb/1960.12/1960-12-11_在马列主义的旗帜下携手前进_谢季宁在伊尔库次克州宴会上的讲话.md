Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The full text of the speech given by Xie Jieting, First Secretary of the Irkutsk Oblast Committee of the CPSU, at a banquet held by the Irkutsk Oblast Committee of the CPSU and the Oblast Soviet Executive Committee for the Chinese Party and Government Delegation on the 9th of this month is as follows:

Dear Comrade Liu Shaoqi!
Dear Comrades and Friends from the People's Republic of China!
Dear Comrade Brezhnev!

Please allow me, on behalf of the Irkutsk Oblast Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet of Working People's Deputies of Irkutsk Oblast, and all the working people of Irkutsk Oblast, to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for being able to stay with us and visit our ancient Siberian city in a short period of time.

The working people of Irkutsk Oblast, like all the people of the Soviet Union, are implementing the grand tasks of the Seven-Year Plan with great enthusiasm, making their due contributions to the common cause of developing our country's economy and culture and strengthening the power of the entire socialist camp.

In accordance with the will of the Party and the government, and with the personal participation of Khrushchev (who has visited Irkutsk three times), our people are taming the Angara River, allowing its huge power resources to serve the construction of communism. As you have seen, the Irkutsk Hydroelectric Power Station is generating electricity at full capacity.

In the coming new year, the first generating units of the world's largest Bratsk Hydroelectric Power Station will generate electricity, and the power generation of this power station will be ten times more than the power generation of all the hydroelectric power stations in Russia before the revolution. The powerful Ust-Ilimsk power station project is being designed.

Mining enterprises, chemical enterprises, machine manufacturing enterprises, and many other enterprises are being built on the vast land of the state, new cities are being built, agriculture is developing, and science and culture are developing rapidly.

Dear comrades, friends! The people of Irkutsk, together with all the people of the Soviet Union, are happy for the ever-developing and strengthening friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. We are delighted that the great Chinese people are advancing hand in hand with us under the banner of immortal Marxism-Leninism in the great cause of building a new world.

We are heartily happy for your achievements and are convinced that the hardworking Chinese people, under the leadership of their glorious Communist Party and the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, will achieve new and outstanding achievements in building socialist China.

Please allow me to propose a toast to the great and unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, to the heroic Chinese Communist Party and its Chairman Comrade Mao Zedong, to our great neighbor and reliable comrade-in-arms, the People's Republic of China and its Chairman Comrade Liu Shaoqi! Long live the unbreakable alliance and eternal friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union!

    在马列主义的旗帜下携手前进
    谢季宁在伊尔库次克州宴会上的讲话
    新华社讯　苏共伊尔库次克州委会第一书记谢季宁9日在苏共伊尔库次克州委会和州苏维埃执行委员会为中国党政代表团举行的宴会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的刘少奇同志！亲爱的来自中华人民共和国的同志们和朋友
  们！亲爱的勃列日?夫同志！
    请允许我代表苏联共产党伊尔库次克州委会、伊尔库次克州劳动人民代表苏维埃和伊尔库次克州全体劳动人民，衷心地感谢你们，感谢你们能够在我们这里停留，并用短短的时间访问我们古老的西伯利亚城市。
    伊尔库次克州的劳动人民和全体苏联人民一样，以巨大的热情执行着七年计划的宏伟任务，他们对我国经济和文化的发展、对加强整个社会主义阵营的威力的共同事业作着应作的贡献。
    根据党和政府的意志，在赫鲁晓夫（他曾三次访问过伊尔库次克）的亲自参加下，我国人民正在驯服安加拉河，让它的巨大的动力资源为共产主义建设服务。你们已经看到，伊尔库次克水电站正在用它的全部能力发电。
    在就要到来的新的一年中，世界上最大的布拉次克水电站的第一批机组将要发电，这个水电站的发电量将比革命前俄国所有水电站的发电量多十倍。强大的乌斯特伊利姆电站的工程正在设计中。
    在州的广阔的土地上正在建设着矿山企业、化学企业、机器制造企业和许多其他企业，新的城市正在兴建，农业在发展，科学和文化正在迅速地发展。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们！伊尔库次克人同全体苏联人民一道为苏联和中华人民共和国两国人民之间日益发展和加强的友谊而高兴。我们感到欢欣鼓舞的是，伟大的中国人民在建设新世界的伟大事业中，在不朽的马克思列宁主义的旗帜下同我们一道携手前进。
    我们为你们的成就而感到衷心高兴，并且坚信，勤劳的中国人民在自己的光荣的共产党和以毛泽东同志为首的党中央委员会的领导下，在建设社会主义的中国方面将取得新的卓越的成就。
    请允许我提议，为中苏两国人民伟大的、牢不可破的友谊，为英雄的中国共产党和它的主席毛泽东同志，为我们的伟大邻邦和可靠的战友中华人民共和国和它的主席刘少奇同志干杯！中苏两国人民的牢不可破的同盟和永恒的友谊万岁！
