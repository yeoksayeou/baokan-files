    Sino-Korean Friendship Shines Throughout the Spring – Impressions of a Visit to Korea
    Xiao Xiangrong

    The city of Pyongyang was once scorched earth everywhere,
    Today, magnificent buildings fill the picturesque landscape;
    May I ask the diligent initiators of this transformation,
    What will the future hold, even more splendid than now?

    Ode to the Korean People's Army Martyrs' Hall
    Heroic posture, unwavering spirit, courageous and mighty,
    Bathing in blood on the battlefield, loyal to the nation;
    Today, victory songs recount their battle achievements,
    For thousands of years, we are fortunate to admire their noble spirit.

    Ode to the Cemetery of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Martyrs
    China and Korea are as close as lips and teeth,
    Years of wind and rain have tested our neighborly friendship;
    Revolutionary spirit solidified in azure blood,
    The cemetery will eternally illuminate those who come after.

    Visiting the Shangyang China-Korea Friendship Agricultural Cooperative
    Sino-Korean friendship shines throughout the spring,
    Admiring the agricultural cooperative, I visited Shangyang;
    Joyfully witnessing the continuous "Chollima" leaps,
    Soaring and advancing directly into a celestial paradise.

    Ode to Kumgang Friendship
    For the love of famous mountains, chasing tigers and wolves,
    Not hesitating to stain Kumgang with fresh blood;
    Many beautiful stories of Sino-Korean comrades-in-arms,
    Spreading throughout the world, eternally fragrant.

    Farewell to Korea
    Twenty days have been filled with the fragrance of friendship,
    The returning car is filled with warmth and harmony.
    The long-lasting affection of Mount Paektu remains,
    The cold Yalu River does not exhaust our righteousness;
    Azure blood solidifies in the sand, lasting for ten thousand years,
    A loyal heart shines on the sun, reflecting a thousand reds.
    If turbulent waves rise again,
    We will strike directly into the dark abyss and斩斩斩 the evil dragon.

    中朝友谊遍春光——访朝即景
    萧向荣
    平壤市当年遍地皆焦土，今日崇楼满画图；为问辛勤经始者，明朝光景更何如？
    题朝鲜人民军烈士馆英姿烈骨气豪雄，浴血疆场报国忠；此日凯歌陈战绩，千秋犹幸仰高风。
    题中国人民志愿军烈士陵园中朝唇齿最相亲，风雨多年验友邻；革命精神凝碧血，陵园千古照来人。
    访上阳朝中友谊农业社中朝友谊遍春光，为慕农社访上阳；喜见连年“千里马”，飞腾直跃进仙乡。
    题金刚友谊为爱名山逐虎狼，不辞鲜血染金刚；中朝战友多佳话，传遍人间万古芳。
    别朝鲜二十天来熏谊风，归车香载暖融融。白头山老情长在，鸭绿江寒义不穷；碧血凝沙垂万古，丹心照日映千红。沧波若再兴风浪，直捣幽渊斩孽龙。
