    Thoroughly Investigate the Natural Conditions and Farming Implement Usage Habits of Each Production Team
    Dali City Suburban Commune Farm Implement Factory Makes Every Effort to Improve the Quality of Small Farm Implements
    (Our Report) According to the Yunnan Daily: The Dali City Suburban Commune Farm Implement Factory in Yunnan, based on the natural conditions and the habits and preferences of farmers in various management districts, actively arranges the production of small farm implements and makes every effort to improve their quality.
    The Suburban Commune Farm Implement Factory originally focused on producing larger farm implements such as horse-drawn carts and threshing machines. After August this year, the commune Party committee, based on the needs of the countryside, organized the farm implement factory to shift its focus to producing small farm implements. At that time, some cadres and workers did not fully recognize the importance of producing small farm implements, feeling that their output value was low and the technology simple, and they did not engage in it enthusiastically. The factory Party branch, on the one hand, educated the staff and workers on vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, establishing the viewpoint of serving agriculture honestly; on the other hand, it organized factory directors, management cadres, and workers to take turns investigating the needs of agricultural production at various times in management districts and production teams, and listening to the opinions and requirements of farmers. In contact with the farmers, the staff and workers received a profound education. When they visited commune members in the Fuxing management district, the commune members took out a flat hoe made in Baoshan and one made by the Suburban Commune Farm Implement Factory for the factory director to compare, and said: "If your factory can make hoes of the same quality as those from Baoshan, we will give you a big red flower." Some commune members raised many suggestions for improvement regarding the hoes and sickles previously produced by the factory. When the staff and workers visited the Daguan Yi management district, some commune members took out various small farm implements of different specifications, explaining to the workers which ones were suitable for digging the ground and which ones were suitable for cultivating vegetable plots, requesting the factory to make them according to the models. The staff and workers saw that the demand for small farm implements in agricultural production was very large, and the quality requirements were also high, and after hearing the farmers' requests, they understood the importance of producing small farm implements. Some workers said that even with skillful hands, good tools are still needed. Cultivating crops is like blacksmithing; the tools must be handy to dig quickly and dig a lot.
    In order to make the production of small farm implements more in line with the needs of the farmers, the staff and workers of the Suburban Commune Farm Implement Factory conducted extensive investigation and research work. The staff and workers found that the plowshares used in the Daguan Yi, Xianfeng, and other management districts on the north bank of the West Er River needed to be larger, and the flat hoe needed to be like a tile, wide at the top and narrow at the bottom; while the flat hoes in the Tianjing and Fuxing management districts on the south bank of the river needed to be thick on all sides and thin in the middle; and the plowshares in the mountainous Taiyi, Diao Cao, and other management districts needed to be smaller. In terms of the required quantities, sickles and plowshares were needed in large quantities during the autumn harvest and autumn planting; small flat hoes and willow-leaf hoes were urgently needed during the spring processing; and cross picks and large hoes were needed for winter production.
    Through this investigation, they not only grasped the demand for certain small farm implements in each season throughout the commune, but also grasped the characteristics of the small farm implements that farmers in each management district liked to use. The staff and workers brought back samples of small farm implements from various management districts and arranged production according to the needs and preferences of the farmers.
    "Although small farm implements are small, their quality must be improved." This is another profound understanding that the workers have gained in their production practice. In order to improve the quality of small farm implements, they have adopted methods such as cooperating with large factories, inviting experienced craftsmen to provide guidance, consulting with farmers, asking farmers for ideas, and taking the produced implements to farmers for trial use and evaluation. For example, the factory had never produced plow tips before. When they produced them this time, they invited an experienced craftsman from the Dali City No. 1 General Machinery Factory to come to the factory to provide guidance and master the production technology. In order to make the plow tips truly suit the farmers' needs, they also invited experienced old farmers from nearby management districts with experience in using cattle to the factory to ask for their ideas; after production, they also organized cadres and workers to take them to the fields with the old farmers who used cattle for trial use and evaluation, and made improvements based on the opinions of the farmers. Some commune members said that the plow was too straight and flat; others said: it could be thinner and lighter, which would save iron and be easier to use; some management districts wanted larger plow tips, while others wanted smaller plow tips, and the factory made improvements and improvements based on the results of the trial use and evaluation. The small farm implements they produced on the same day were subject to mass self-inspection by each furnace and each group, and only those that passed the inspection were put into storage. When the commercial departments received the goods, those that were unqualified were returned to the factory for rework and repair before being sold to the commune members. If the farmers found them to be not durable or of poor quality after use, they would return them to the factory, and the factory would repair them free of charge by the original production workers according to the group number on each small farm implement.

    深入调查每个生产队的自然条件和使用农具的习惯
    大理市郊区公社农具厂千方百计提高小农具质量
    本报讯　据云南日报消息：云南大理市郊区公社农具厂，根据各管理区的自然条件和农民的习惯、爱好，积极安排小农具生产，千方百计提高小农具的质量。
    郊区公社农具厂原来以生产马车、打谷机等较大农具为主，今年8月以后，公社党委根据农村的需要，组织农具厂转向生产小农具为主。当时，有些干部和工人对生产小农具的重要性认识不足，觉得小农具产值低，技术简单，没有搞场。工厂党支部一方面对职工进行大办农业、大办粮食的教育，树立老老实实为农业服务的观点；一方面组织厂长、管理干部、工人轮流到管理区、生产队调查各个时期农业生产的需要，听取农民的意见和要求。在与农民接触当中，职工们受到了深刻的教育。当他们到福兴管理区访问社员时，社员们拿出保山打的一把板锄和郊区公社农具厂打的一把比较给厂长看，并说：“如果你们厂打出像保山这样质量好的锄头来，就给你们带大红花。”有的社员对该厂过去生产的锄头、镰刀提出了很多改进意见。职工们到大关邑管理区访问时，有的社员拿出了各种不同规格的小农具，讲给工人那种适用于挖地，那种适用于盘蔬菜地，要求厂里照样子做。职工们看到了农业生产上对小农具的需要量很大，质量要求也高，听到了农民的要求，懂得了生产小农具的重要。有的工人说，手巧还要家什妙，盘庄稼同打铁一样，工具称手，才挖得快，挖得多。
    为了使小农具的生产更切合农民的需要，郊区公社农具厂的职工们广泛地进行了调查研究工作。职工们发现西洱河北岸的大关邑、先锋等管理区，使用的犁头要大一点，板锄要像一片瓦，上宽下窄；而靠河南岸的天井、福兴管理区板锄又要四边厚，中间薄；山区的太乙、吊草等管理区犁头又要小一点。在需要的数量上，秋收秋种中，镰刀、犁头的需要量大；小春加工中急需要小板锄、柳叶小条锄；而冬季生产又需要十字镐、大条锄。
    经过这一番调查，既掌握了全公社每个节令中对某些小农具的需要量，也掌握了每个管理区农民爱用的小农具的特点。职工们从各管理区带回了小农具的样品，按照农民的需要和爱好安排了生产。
    “小农具虽然小，质量一定要搞好”。这是工人们在生产实践中的又一深刻体会。为了提高小农具的质量，他们采取了与大厂协作，请老师傅来指导；与农民协商，请农民出主意；生产出来后，再拿到农民中去试用鉴定等等办法。如该厂没有生产过犁尖，这次生产时，就到大理市第一通用机械厂请老师傅来厂里指导，掌握了生产技术。为了使犁尖真正合农民心意，他们又把附近几个管理区有使牛经验的老农民请到厂里来，请农民出主意；生产出来以后，又组织干部和工人会同使牛的老农，拿到田里去试用鉴定，根据农民的意见进行改进。有的社员说犁太直太平；有的说：可以再薄些、轻些，又省铁，又好使；有的管理区要大犁尖，有的管理区要小犁尖，厂里都根据试用鉴定情况一一改进提高。他们当天生产出来的小农具，每盘炉子，每个小组都进行群众性的自我检验，合格才入库。商业部门收货时，不合格的要退给厂里返工重修，然后才出售给社员。农民使用后，不经久耐用、质量不好的退给厂里，厂里再按照每件小农具上的组别号码，由原来生产的工人免费修理。
