Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, December 18th. The "Chinese Mass Art Exhibition," jointly sponsored by the Albanian Ministry of Culture and the Committee for Foreign Cultural Relations, opened at the Tirana Art Gallery at 5:00 PM on the 17th.

　　The exhibition features 170 works created by Chinese workers, peasants, and soldiers. Visitors showed particular interest in the works by Chinese workers, peasants, and soldiers depicting their own labor and lives through paintings, woodcuts, and paper-cuts, as well as works with themes centered on the Great Leap Forward, the People’s Communes, and military life. Visitors eagerly invited Ying Tao, a Chinese painter currently visiting Albania, to introduce Chinese painting. After visiting the exhibition, Albanian Foreign Cultural Committee Chairman Treska and Deputy Minister of Culture Mitroyorgji wrote in the guestbook: “We are pleased to have visited this wonderful exhibition of mass art. It warmly expresses the love of Chinese workers and peasants for their ever-developing new life. China has a long and ingenious artistic tradition, but it is only under the people’s regime that this high art has flourished so vigorously. This exhibition demonstrates the great talent of the masses and the care of the Chinese Communist Party for the art of the people. We are convinced that it will strengthen the unbreakable friendship between our two countries.”

    “中国群众画展”在地拉那开幕
    据新华社地拉那18日电　由阿尔巴尼亚文化部和对外文化联络委员会联合主办的“中国群众画展”，17日下午五时在地拉那画廊开幕。
    画展展出了我国工农兵群众的作品共一百七十件。参观者对我国工人、农民、士兵通过绘画、木刻、剪纸描绘他们自己的劳动和生活的作品，以及以大跃进、人民公社、部队生活为创作主题的作品，特别感兴趣。参观者纷纷邀请正在阿尔巴尼亚访问的我国画家英韬介绍中国的绘画。阿尔巴尼亚对外文委主席特雷斯卡和文化部副部长米特罗约尔基参观后，在留言簿上写道：“我们满意地参观了这一美好的群众创作的画展。它热情地表达了中国工人和农民对日益发展的新生活的热爱。中国具有悠久的巧妙的艺术传统，但是只有在人民政权下，这种高度的艺术才有了如此蓬勃的发展。这一展览会表现了人民群众的伟大天才和中国共产党对人民艺术的关怀。我们深信，它将加强我们两国间的牢不可破的友谊。”
