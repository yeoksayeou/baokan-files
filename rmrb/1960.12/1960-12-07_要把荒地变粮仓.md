　　Turning Wasteland into Granary
　　Yin A'mei, Shanghai Baoshan County Yangxing People's Commune Tractor Station

　　Have you been to Chongming Island in Shanghai, surrounded by the sea and roaring waves? There is a newly reclaimed Xinhua Farm on the island. If you have the opportunity to come to our place, you will definitely feel a surge of warmth. When you stand on the newly built road and look east, the vast expanse of silvery-white cotton fields, like snowflakes, will surely attract you. If you turn around and face west, you will surely exclaim from the bottom of your heart: Ah! What a magnificent expanse of land! Tens of thousands of mu of wheat fields are better than a large prairie (a month ago today, this vast area was golden rice paddies). The wheat seedlings are dancing in the wind. If you ask the guide next to you why there is such a large piece of land that grows such attractive crops, he will tell you how we used our hands to change this land.

　　A year ago today, this was still an endless reed marsh. At that time, there was a folk song that wrote: "Northwest of Chongming, there is a Beidahuang, the tide rises like an ocean, the tide recedes like a reed marsh, hundreds of miles are uninhabited, only seagulls hide." In order to reclaim this reed beach, a year ago today, the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee issued the fighting call to "turn wasteland into granary," which shook the hearts of young people in the suburbs of Shanghai like a spring thunder. 30,000 reclamation troops responded to the Party's fighting call, rushed here, determined to turn Chongming's reed and grass beaches into fertile fields, into a base for non-staple food for the city. I followed our Baoshan mechanized land reclamation team, and marched mightily to Chongming Island. When we arrived at our destination, what appeared before us was a vast and boundless desolate reed marsh. We built our home on this weedy, seagull-inhabited reed and grass beach. Comrades, with amazing revolutionary perseverance and tenacious fighting will, cut through thorns and overcome all kinds of difficulties, and finally won today's victory. Based on today's situation, people have composed new folk songs:

　　“In the past, it was a reed marsh,
　　Now the granary is full of grain,
　　The power of the three red flags is great,
　　Wasteland has since become a granary.”

　　Looking back on the situation when we first arrived here a year ago, it was very interesting. At that time, there were no roads, no lights, and no houses. We ate salt water, lived in reed sheds, and slept on damp straw mats. We felt very unaccustomed to life. In addition, when tractors plowed the land on reed piles, vehicle-sinking accidents often occurred. Under such circumstances, some comrades' thoughts began to waver. Some said: It's more fun to drive a tractor in Baoshan than to come to Chongming to reclaim wasteland. We don't eat salt water and sleep comfortably. I felt the same way. But I thought: That's how happiness is earned. The happiness gained through struggle is the greatest happiness. We are here to ask the Dragon King for land, to produce a large amount of grain, chickens, ducks, fish, meat, and vegetables on this barren reed and grass beach to supply the city and improve the lives of the people in the city. How glorious our task is! What does it matter if we live in grass sheds, drink salt water, and endure a little hardship! If we are unwilling to live in grass sheds and drink salt water, the lives of more people will not be improved. We should fight here and contribute to the construction of the motherland and the improvement of the lives of the people in the city with our own hands. I also recalled the suffering I endured as a child working for the landlord and being oppressed by the landlord.

　　When I was eight years old, I followed my mother to work for the landlord. Once, I carelessly hoeed off a cotton seedling and was beaten severely by the landlord. My mother and I worked for the landlord year after year, day after day, eating grass soup, living in thatched houses, wearing rags, and living a life of "wind sweeping the ground and moon lighting the lamp." I also compared myself to the Red Army crossing the snowy mountains and grasslands, and questioned myself. At this time, my thoughts changed.

　　I thought: Today, to rapidly change the "poor and blank" face of the motherland, to build a new socialist countryside, and to enable 650 million people to live a happy and fulfilling life, we young people need to use our own hands to engage in arduous labor and create our new life. Today, we have become the masters of the land. If we don't fight against the land, where does the joy come from?

　　After I exchanged these ideas with other comrades, everyone also talked freely about their ideas. We met and analyzed our thoughts, and everyone's ideas became consistent. We were all full of energy and doubled our efforts, plowing the land day and night. Finally, we successfully completed our glorious task of land reclamation.

　　Ah! What a big change, in just one year, tens of thousands of mu of beaches have been reclaimed and planted with barley, broad beans, and vegetables. On the large piece of land we reclaimed, such good crops are growing. This year, the average yield of rice is more than 670 catties per mu. A large-scale new-type farm has been built here - Xinhua Farm (with 100,000 mu of land). Brand-new roads have been built, and rows of beautiful houses have been built. The commune members here are using their own hands to build their farm like a beautiful garden.

　　I deeply realize that in the vast liberated land, we young people who grew up in the Mao Zedong era are extremely happy. As long as we work hard with our own hands and extract treasures from the land - grain and cotton - our days will become better and better, and the happy and fulfilling communist life will come sooner.

### 要把荒地变粮仓

    要把荒地变粮仓
    上海市宝山县杨行人民公社拖拉机站　尹阿妹
    你到过那四面环海、浪涛滚滚的上海市崇明岛吗？岛上有一个新垦荒的新海农场，如果你有机会来到我们这个地方，那你一定浑身就有一种热呼呼的感觉。当你站在新建的公路上向东极目望去，那一大片朵絮如雪的银白色的棉海，就会把你吸引住，假使转身朝西站着，你一定会惊异地从内心呼出：呵！多么雄伟的一大片土地啊！上万亩的麦田胜过一个大草原（一个月前的今天，这一大片是金黄色的稻浪）。麦苗儿在随风飘舞。你要问站在你旁边的向导同志，为什么有这么大片土地，生长出那么吸引人的好庄稼来呢？他会告诉你，我们是怎样用双手改变这里的土地的。
    一年前的今天，这里还是一片无边无际的芦苇塘。当时有一首民歌这样写道：“崇明西北方，有个北大荒，涨潮像汪洋，退潮像芦荡，百里遥遥无人烟，唯有海鸥把身藏。”为了开垦这片芦滩，一年前的今天，中共上海市委发出了
  “变荒地为粮仓”的战斗号召，它一声春雷震动着全上海郊区青年的心。三万围垦大军响应党的战斗号召，奔向这里，决心要把崇明的这些芦滩、草滩变为良田，变为城市的副食品基地。我随着我们宝山机耕垦荒队，浩浩荡荡开赴崇明岛。到了目的地，在我们面前出现的是一大片一望无际的荒芜了的芦苇塘。我们就在这野草丛生、海鸥栖息的芦滩、草滩上，建立起我们的家。同志们以惊人的革命毅力和顽强的战斗意志，披荆斩棘，克服了种种困难，终于赢得了今天的胜利。人们根据今天的情景，又编出了新民歌：
     “过去一片芦苇荡，
    如今粮食堆满场，
    三面红旗威力大，
    荒滩从此变粮仓。”
    回想起一年前我们刚到这里的情况，是非常有趣的。那时候，没有路，没有灯，又没有房子，吃的是盐水，住的是芦苇棚，睡在潮湿的草垫上，生活上感到很不习惯，再加上拖拉机在芦苇堆上耕地，常常有陷车事故发生，在这种情况下，有的同志思想开始有些动摇了。有的说：不到崇明来开荒，在宝山开拖拉机倒蛮开心，吃不到盐水，睡得又舒适，我的思想上也有同感。但我想：幸福就是这样换得来的。经过斗争所换得来的幸福，才是最大的幸福。我们在这里向海龙王要土地，在这荒芜的芦滩草滩上要生产出大量的粮食、鸡鸭、鱼肉、蔬菜，去供应城市，改善城市人民的生活，我们的任务是多么光荣啊！我们住草棚、喝盐水，吃一点苦，算得了什么！如果我们不愿住草棚、不愿喝盐水，更多的人生活就得不到改善。我们应该战斗在这里用自己的双手，为祖国的建设和城市人民生活的改善做出贡献。我又回忆小时候给地主做工，受地主压迫的苦楚。
    我在八岁的时候，就跟着妈妈给地主做工，有一次，我不当心锄掉了一株棉苗，就给地主痛打一顿。我和母亲给地主一年做到头，一天做到晚，吃的草头汤，住的茅草房，穿的破衣裳，过的是“风扫地、月点灯”的生活。我又对比当年红军过雪山、越草地，责问自己，这时我的思想就转变过来了。
    我想：今天，要迅速改变祖国“一穷二白”的面貌，要建设社会主义新农村，要使六亿五千万人民过着美满幸福的生活，就需要我们青年人用自己的双手去从事艰苦的劳动，去创造我们的新生活。今天自己做了土地的主人，不与地斗争，乐又从何来呢？
    我把这些想法，跟别的同志交换了以后，大家也畅谈了自己的想法，思想见面了，又进行了分析，大家的想法一致了。我们就个个精神充沛，干劲倍增，昼夜不停地机耕，最后，终于胜利完成了我们垦荒的光荣任务。
    呵！变化多么大，仅仅一年的时间，开垦了几万亩的滩地，种上了大麦、蚕豆和蔬菜。在我们垦荒的那一大片土地上，生长出这么好的庄稼，今年水稻平均单产六百七十多斤，这里已建了一个规模较大的新型农场——新海农场（有十万亩土地），这里已修筑起崭新的公路，已盖起一幢幢漂亮的房屋，在这里的社员，正在用自己的双手，把自己的农场建设得像美丽的大花园。
    我深切地体会到，在解放了的广阔土地上，我们生长在毛泽东时代的青年，是无比幸福的，只要我们用自己的双手，努力奋斗，向土地索取宝藏——粮食、棉花，我们的日子就会一天天更美好起来，那美满幸福的共产主义生活就会早日到来。
