Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 22nd - Anshun Special District in Guizhou Province has seized the current peak season for purchasing and sales to develop market trade activities in a planned and organized way, enlivening the rural economy.

Since the autumn harvest, on every market day (generally on commune members' holidays), commune members bring various agricultural and sideline native products to the market, selling the products that should be sold to the state-owned stores; after fulfilling the task of selling to the state, they sell the surplus products on the market and buy back the goods they need. On market days in Chengguan Commune, Anshun City, the number of people has increased from more than 10,000 to more than 30,000, and the types of goods on the market have increased from 74 to 121. The amount of local pottery, bamboo and wood products, dried and fresh fish and shrimp, medicinal materials, and vegetables on the market has increased by one to four times respectively. Some commodities that were in short supply some time ago, such as piglets, dried chili peppers, ginger, and garlic, are now also beginning to be marketed in batches. In order to strengthen the leadership of rural market trade, the state-owned commercial, banking, taxation and other departments in the market area, together with commune and production team cadres, jointly formed a market management committee to publicize policies to the masses and guide transactions. In the market, state-owned commercial departments have also set up purchasing and sales stalls, which not only facilitates commune members' buying and selling, but also vigorously promotes the current procurement of agricultural and sideline products. According to preliminary statistics, the total purchase volume of state-owned stores in the entire special district generally increases by five to six times compared with normal days on market days, and the supply volume increases by two to three times.

    安顺专区开展农村集市贸易
    新华社贵阳22日电　贵州省安顺专区抓住当前购销旺季，有领导有计划地开展集市贸易活动，活跃了农村经济。
    秋收以来，每逢集日（一般都是社员休假日），社员们带着各种农副土特产品到市场上来，把其中属于应向国家交售的产品卖给国营商店；完成向国家交售任务以后的多余产品，就在市上出售，买回自己需要的商品。安顺市城关公社的赶场天，人数已由原来的一万多人增加到三万多人，上市商品种类由原来的七十四种增加到一百二十一种。土陶器、竹木器、干鲜鱼虾、药材、蔬菜的上市量，分别增加一至四倍。前些时候上市较少的商品，如仔猪、干辣椒、生姜、蒜头等，现在也开始成批上市。为加强对农村集市贸易的领导，场集所在地的国营商业、银行、税务等部门，会同公社、生产队干部，共同组成市场管理委员会，向群众宣传政策，指导交易。在集市上，国营商业部门还增设了购销摊点，既便利社员买卖，又有力地推动了当前的农副产品采购工作。据初步统计，全专区国营商店每逢赶场天，收购总额一般比平时增加五倍到六倍，供应总额增加两倍到三倍。
