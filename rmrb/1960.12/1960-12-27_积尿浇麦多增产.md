    Accumulating Urine for Wheat Irrigation Leads to Increased Production
    The Haojiafu Production Team of the Songzhuang Commune in Tong County, Beijing, has been experimenting with using urine as top dressing for wheat for the past two years. Wheat fields irrigated with urine have increased production by about 20% compared to those not irrigated with urine.
    The method of using urine fertilizer for wheat is as follows: first, it is fermented, and then diluted with one to two times the amount of water. It is then applied along the wheat rows or added when irrigating the wheat. The best time to apply urine is before the wheat roots begin to grow and before it turns green. The amount of urine to apply per mu should be determined based on specific conditions. According to the experience of the Songzhuang Commune, the greatest increase in production is achieved when 1,500 to 2,000 jin of urine are applied per mu on generally moderately fertile land. After snowfall, when wheat seedlings are covered with snow, it is not advisable to apply urine, because in this case, the application of urine will cause the snow to melt, and the wheat seedlings will be easily damaged by frost.

    积尿浇麦多增产
    北京通县宋庄公社郝家府生产队两年来试行给小麦浇尿追肥的办法，浇尿的麦田比不浇尿的麦田增产二成左右。
    用尿肥浇麦的办法是：先经过发酵，然后兑一倍到两倍的水，顺麦垅施浇或随给小麦灌水时浇入。浇尿的时间，最好是在小麦盘根到返青以前，每亩地浇尿多少，要根据具体情况确定，根据宋庄公社的经验，在一般中等肥力的土地上，每亩地浇一千五百斤至两千斤，增产的幅度最大。下雪以后，麦苗有积雪复盖的时候，不宜浇尿，因为在这种情况下，浇尿会使积雪融化，麦苗容易受到冻害。
