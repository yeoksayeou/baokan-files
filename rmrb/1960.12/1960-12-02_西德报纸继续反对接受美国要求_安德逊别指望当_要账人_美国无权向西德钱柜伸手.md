Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, November 30th. West German newspapers continue to express dissatisfaction with the U.S. demand that West Germany provide funds to help resolve the U.S. international payments crisis.

    The *Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung*, which often reflects the views of the Bonn government, expressed particular dissatisfaction in a commentary today with the U.S. demand for occupation fees from West Germany. The newspaper said that the Bonn government is willing to "make more contributions to the U.S.'s payment difficulties," but the White House's insistence on demanding occupation fees, which West Germany cannot agree to, "is incomprehensible."

    The West German bourgeois newspaper *Frankfurter Rundschau* also emphasized in an editorial today that the U.S. demand for West Germany to pay occupation fees would "discriminate" against West Germany and "degrade" West Germany's status in the eyes of other countries in the North Atlantic group. The commentary also stated, "West Germany is not richer or more capable of paying just because it has had surpluses for several years. And the U.S. is not poorer or less capable of paying just because it has recently had deficits."

    The *Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung* believes that Eisenhower's demand for money from West Germany is a "regrettable, poorly planned move" to leave a "well-off home" for his successor by means of a "blitzkrieg-like" method before he steps down.

    An article published in today's issue of the weekly magazine *Der Spiegel* said that Anderson is pressuring West Germany for money with the face of a "debt collector," while West Germany "unhesitatingly refused" and rejected his demands as "unrealistic ideas." The article also asked: Does Anderson, as a representative of the outgoing U.S. government, have the "legal qualification" to reach into West Germany's treasury on the grounds of covering deficits?

    The West German Federation of Industry's newspaper *Deutsche Zeitung und Wirtschaftszeitung* commented today, taking advantage of the decline in the U.S.'s position to demand that the U.S. yield to Western Europe. It said that in the past, the U.S. refused to "closely unite" with Western Europe on financial and economic policies, citing "its leading role in the world requires freedom of action" as a reason, but today this reason "no longer exists."

    西德报纸继续反对接受美国要求
    安德逊别指望当“要账人”  美国无权向西德钱柜伸手
    新华社波恩30日电　西德报纸继续对美国要西德出钱帮助解救美国国际支付危机一事表示不满。
    经常反映波恩政府意见的《法兰克福汇报》今天在一篇评论中对美国向西德索取占领费一事特别表示不满。报纸说，波恩政府愿意“为美国的支付困难作出更多的贡献”，但是，白宫偏偏坚持要求西德所不能答应的占领费“是不可理解的”。
    西德资产阶级报纸《法兰克福评论报》今天在一篇社论中也强调，美国要求西德付占领费将使西德“受到歧视”，使西德在北大西洋集团其他国家眼里的地位“遭到贬低”。评论还说，“西德并不因为几年来支付有剩余就更阔气和支付能力更大。而美国也不因为最近支付有亏空就显得更穷和支付能力更小。”
    《法兰克福汇报》认为艾森豪威尔向西德要钱是一个“令人遗憾的，计划得很坏的举动”，是想在他下台之前以一种“奇袭式的”办法给后继者留下一个“景况良好的家底”。
    今天出版的《镜》周刊登载的一篇文章说，安德逊是带着一副“要账人”的面孔迫着向西德要钱，而西德则“毫不犹豫地加以拒绝”，把他的要求看成是“不可指望的想法”给予驳回。文章还问道：安德逊作为一个即将下台的美国政府的代表，是否有“合法资格”以支付亏空为理由把手伸向西德的钱柜。
    西德工业联合会机关报《德意志报与经济报》在今天的评论中借美国地位的下降而要美国向西欧屈服，它说，过去美国以“它在世界上的领导作用需要行动自由”为理由，拒绝在财政经济政策上同西欧“紧密团结”，而今天这个理由“已经不存在了”。
