    How to Prevent and Control Overwintering Diseases and Insect Pests of Crops?

    From the current situation in our country, in addition to focusing on the prevention and control of wheat rust in winter wheat producing areas, we should also focus on the overwintering control of the three major stem borers: rice stem borer, corn borer, and cotton bollworm in rice, coarse grain, and cotton producing areas. These three kinds of stem borers are vulnerable during the overwintering period, and their overwintering locations are relatively concentrated: rice stem borers overwinter mainly in rice stubble; corn borers overwinter mainly in the stalks of corn, sorghum, millet, and hemp, and a small number overwinter in crop stubble, corn cobs, and weeds; cotton bollworms overwinter in seed cotton, cottonseed, and the walls and crevices of warehouses and ginning rooms where cotton is stored, and a small number overwinter in flower drying screens and dry bolls. Treating these overwintering sites can not only control these three major stem borers, but also control many other diseases and insect pests.

    Based on the characteristic that rice stem borer larvae overwinter mainly in rice roots, we can expand winter plowing and winter planting, eliminate hardpan fields, dig up, pull out, and collect rice roots for composting, fertilizing, or using as fuel or for other purposes. The above methods should be completed before spring plowing. In areas where water sources are convenient, we can combine spring plowing with soaking the fields to drown the overwintering borers in the rice roots with short-term immersion. To prevent and control overwintering corn borers, we must first identify the main overwintering sites of corn borers in the local area, comprehensively plan prevention and control measures, and prevent any from slipping through the net. Stalks of sorghum and corn and corn cobs can be treated in conjunction with the comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products to eliminate the overwintering corn borers. For overwintering cotton bollworms, since they can be frozen to death if exposed to minus four degrees Celsius for about ten consecutive days, areas where the winter temperature is below minus four degrees Celsius for about ten consecutive days can place the remaining seed cotton and cottonseed outdoors in the coldest period of winter to freeze them. Cotton purchasing stations, ginning mills, cottonseed oil mills, and other units in various regions can adopt comprehensive prevention and control measures such as sealing wall holes, spraying chemicals, and fumigating cottonseed in freight yards, flower storage warehouses, and workshops to eliminate overwintering red bollworms.

    怎样防治农作物越冬病虫害？
    防治越冬病虫害，从我国目前情况来看，除了在冬小麦产区应当狠抓小麦锈病的防治以外，在水稻、杂粮和棉花产区，应当狠抓水稻三化螟虫、玉米螟虫和棉花红铃虫等三大钻心虫的越冬防治。这三种钻心虫的越冬期有懈可击，越冬的场所比较集中：水稻三化螟虫集中在水稻根茬里过冬；玉米螟虫主要在玉米、高粱、谷子、麻的秸秆里过冬，少部分在作物根茬、玉米穗轴和杂草里过冬；棉花红铃虫在籽棉、棉籽和堆放棉花的仓库、轧花间的墙壁、缝隙里过冬，少部分在晒花的帘子和枯铃里过冬。处理这些越冬场所，不仅可以防治这三大钻心虫，还可以兼治许多其他病虫害。
    根据三化螟虫以幼虫集中在稻根里过冬的特点，可以扩大冬耕冬种、消灭板田，把稻根挖、拔、捡拾收集起来熏肥沤肥或作燃料或作其他用途，采取以上办法在春耕前处理完毕。水源方便的地方，可以结合春耕沤田，短期浸水淹死稻根内的过冬螟虫。防治越冬玉米螟虫首先必须查清当地玉米螟虫主要的越冬场所，全面规划防治，防止漏网。对高粱、玉米秸秆、玉米穗轴可结合农副产品的综合利用等进行处理，消灭其中过冬的玉米螟虫。对于越冬棉花红铃虫，由于它在摄氏零下四度持续十天左右就被冻死，冬季气温在摄氏零下四度以下持续十天左右的地区，可以在三九寒天把存留的籽棉和棉籽放在室外，平摊冷冻。各地的棉花收购站、轧花厂、棉籽榨油厂等单位，可以采取对货场、贮花库、车间进行糊封墙洞，喷撒药剂和熏蒸棉籽等综合防治办法，消灭越冬红铃虫。
