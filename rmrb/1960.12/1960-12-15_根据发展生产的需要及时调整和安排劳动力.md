    Adjust and Arrange Labor in a Timely Manner According to the Needs of Production Development
    Chang Dengbang
    Rationally arranging and utilizing labor according to the needs of production development is a regular and important task of rural people's communes. Conscientiously doing this work well can effectively promote the sustained leap forward in agricultural production.

    Since liberation, like all parts of the country, the Chengmen Commune in Minhou County, Fujian Province, has undergone continuous changes in production relations with the realization of agricultural collectivization and the establishment of people's communes. Many adjustments have been made to the use and arrangement of labor, and each adjustment has effectively promoted the development of production. Taking the Aofeng Brigade of the commune as an example, before the land reform, when individual households engaged in independent production, the grain yield per mu was only 650 jin. In the mutual aid team stage, mutual assistance labor was implemented, and the unit yield increased by 23%. With the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives, the concentrated use of labor was further developed, and people were assigned according to their strengths and skills, making the best use of their talents. As a result, grain yield per mu increased by another 40%.

    After the establishment of the people's commune, in the allocation and use of labor, it was not only possible to uniformly dispatch labor more scientifically and rationally within agriculture but also to adjust and use labor in various industries and trades according to the principle of taking grain as the key link and developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries simultaneously. At the same time, a large number of women were liberated from household labor, adding more than 3,000 laborers to the commune, providing more favorable conditions for the allocation and use of labor. Under this new situation after communization, according to the Party's policy of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing diversified operations, and according to the principle of running some industries within our capacity to meet the needs of agricultural development and people's lives, we made a comprehensive adjustment of labor based on the production team, thus more effectively promoting the high-speed development of various productions. In the first year after the establishment of the commune, grain production increased by 14%, citrus production changed from a small year to a large year, and diversified operations increased fivefold. In the past two years, the speed of grain production development has been even faster, and it has now changed from a grain-deficient commune to a grain-surplus commune. These facts fully demonstrate that timely and rational adjustment of labor is not only a regular and important task but also an extremely important key issue in implementing the Party's policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, taking grain as the key link, comprehensively developing diversified operations, and promoting sustained leap forward in production.

    In recent years, although agricultural production has achieved high-speed development, with the overall leap forward of various socialist production and construction undertakings, new and higher demands have been placed on agricultural production, especially grain production. To rapidly develop agricultural production and produce more grain requires sufficient labor. Of course, the fundamental way to improve labor efficiency and develop agricultural production at high speed is to accelerate the technological transformation of agriculture and achieve mechanization, but this requires a process. Under the current situation where our agricultural production technology level is still very low, to substantially increase the production of grain and other agricultural products, we mainly rely on manual labor. Furthermore, from the perspective of agriculture itself, in implementing the policy of combining multiple harvests and high yields, with the comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, the degree of intensive farming is constantly increasing, and the demand for labor is also greatly increasing. This requires a corresponding increase in the labor force on the front line of agricultural production to ensure the needs of the great development of agricultural production. In addition, judging from the current arrangement and use of agricultural labor, there are still some problems. For example, some departments transfer too much labor from agriculture, occupying too much of the main labor force; some production units, due to lack of experience, have excessively detailed and rigid divisions of labor, such as some brigades having more than a dozen specialized teams for animal husbandry, vegetables, flowers and fruits, fish farming, transportation, and sideline occupations, and these specialized teams emphasize specialization, dividing troops and guarding passes, making it difficult to mobilize, resulting in waste of labor and irrational use, so that the labor engaged in grain production cannot be satisfied in terms of quantity or quality. All this requires us to unswervingly adhere to the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, taking grain as the key link, and comprehensively developing diversified operations, and to further rationally adjust labor to ensure the high-speed development of agricultural production, especially grain production.

    At present, it is not only necessary but also entirely possible to transfer a group of laborers from various aspects and departments within the commune to strengthen the front line of agricultural production. In recent years, with the extensive and in-depth development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization and labor efficiency have been greatly improved in commune-run and team-run industries, enterprises, or logistics departments such as canteens. At present, it is possible to complete more production tasks with less labor. In this way, a group of laborers can be transferred from some departments and units to strengthen the front line of agricultural production. At the same time, after communization, the degree of collectivization of production and life has been greatly improved, and rural commercial purchasing and marketing businesses have become more concentrated than in the past. In this way, commercial outlets can also implement a rational layout according to this new situation, freeing up some labor to replenish the front line of agricultural production. Some farmland capital construction projects that were held in the past have basically completed the main projects, and most of the management cadres and labor used in these projects can be adjusted to the front line of agricultural production. Some specialized departments and units have accumulated rich experience in the organization and use of labor. After rational arrangements and comprehensive use, a large number of laborers can also be freed up to return to the front line of agricultural production. All of these provide conditions for rationally arranging labor, further tapping labor potential, and replenishing the agricultural front.

    While analyzing the possibility of concentrating labor to strengthen the front line of agricultural production, the Chengmen Commune Party Committee also saw that the allocation and use of rural labor contains extremely complex relationships, such as the relationship between grain and forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries; the relationship between current production and capital construction; the relationship between the front line of agricultural production and logistics work; the relationship between agriculture and commune and team industries; the relationship between agriculture and finance, trade, culture, and education; and the proportion of cadres who are divorced from production or semi-divorced from production. How to scientifically and rationally handle these complex relationships? According to the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, taking grain as the key link, and comprehensively developing diversified operations, and according to the characteristics of the people's commune as a five-in-one entity of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, the Commune Party Committee determined the principle of "overall planning, comprehensive consideration, ensuring key points (agriculture), and grain first," and launched a mass movement to adjust labor and strengthen the front line of agricultural production by mobilizing the masses, adopting the method of planning, acting, and arranging simultaneously, and transferred a group of laborers from various production departments and aspects to strengthen the front line of agricultural production.

    The factories and enterprises run by the commune and teams were adjusted according to the principle of mainly serving agriculture, while also taking into account serving the lives of the masses, large-scale industry, and exports. After adjustments in various aspects, more than 1,100 laborers were transferred from factories run by the commune and teams alone to replenish the front line of agricultural production.

    In the form of agricultural labor organization, we implement the method of mainly comprehensive management and supplemented by organizing necessary specialized teams. For production that has no seasonal restrictions, no busy or slack seasons, and has special technical requirements, such as nurseries and collectively-run animal husbandry, we fix a small number of people to engage in specialized management; for production that is seasonal, has large differences between busy and slack seasons, and is easy to master in terms of production technology (such as fruit trees and sideline occupations), we implement comprehensive management, which fully utilizes labor potential and greatly saves labor. For example, the Aofeng Brigade originally had six specialized teams for animal husbandry, nurseries, fruit trees, transportation, vegetables, and sideline occupations, occupying more than 130 laborers. After the adjustment, only two specialized teams for animal husbandry and nurseries were retained, freeing up nearly 100 laborers to strengthen the front line of agricultural production, which not only increased the strength of grain production but also took into account the needs of diversified operations and comprehensive development.

    The commercial departments adjusted the commercial network according to the principles of serving production, promoting production, facilitating the masses, and facilitating the development of purchasing and marketing business, saving a total of 67 laborers. Logistics departments such as canteens and departments such as culture, education, and health made full use of semi-labor and auxiliary labor according to the characteristics of their business and according to needs and possibilities.

    In addition, the Chengmen Commune also made corresponding adjustments to the leadership institutions at the commune and brigade levels, and transferred more than 20 leading backbones from the brigade level and above to the production teams to participate in production and lead production, which not only greatly strengthened the leadership force on the front line and improved the leadership style but also closely linked the relationship between cadres and the masses.

    After the overall adjustment, the entire commune concentrated more than 2,000 laborers from various aspects to the agricultural front, increasing the labor force on the front line of agricultural production to more than 80% of the total labor force.

    After concentrating the labor that could be concentrated to the front line of agricultural production, the Chengmen Commune further strengthened political and ideological education, improved the labor organization of various production units and work groups, established and improved the labor management and production responsibility system, conscientiously implemented the "three guarantees and one reward" and the method of evaluating work and recording points, and the policy of distribution according to work, and continued to vigorously grasp tool reform, make great efforts in technical innovation, and do a good job in life arrangement, combining work and rest, thereby further mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members for labor production, and rapidly pushing the mass movement of vigorously developing agriculture and grain to a climax. In the autumn overproduction movement, late rice was top-dressed with ear fertilizer once, and the "armyworm," which had been rare for decades, was promptly extinguished. Sweet potatoes were generally weeded and top-dressed once; autumn harvest and winter planting preparations were done quickly and well, and winter planting base fertilizer increased by 90% compared with the same period last year. Diversified operations and sideline production have made great progress. The soil cultivation of citrus trees was advanced by one season compared with previous years, and the amount of fertilizer applied was also increased by 30% to 50%. Sideline income in September increased by 80% compared with August. This year's winter planting plan has been implemented in the fields, expanding by 60% compared with last year, of which grain crops expanded by 30%. These facts show that timely and reasonable adjustment and use of labor according to the needs of production development can promote the further development of production, and also prove that the Party's proposed measures to concentrate labor and strengthen the front line of agricultural production are completely correct.

    Some comrades once worried that concentrating labor to strengthen the front line of agricultural production would affect the development of other undertakings. Practice has proved that this concern is unnecessary. After concentrating the main labor force on the front line of agricultural production, not only is agricultural production doing well, but other industries have also seen an unprecedented new situation of "reducing manpower and increasing production, doing big things with fewer people." After changing the phenomenon of excessively detailed and rigid specialized division of labor, the Aofeng Brigade not only increased the labor force on the front line of agricultural production by more than 100 people but also promoted the overall leap forward of other diversified operations. The entire team rushed for five days to accumulate more than 100,000 dan of river mud for citrus trees and expanded the planting of vegetables by more than 60 mu; the income from processing white clay in one month was equal to the income of the past three months; the farm tool repair and fitting station completed the repair and fitting tasks of farm tools required for the "three autumns" ahead of schedule; and the tasks of purchasing pigs, chickens, and ducks by the commercial departments were also overfulfilled.

    The above facts fully show that concentrating labor to strengthen the front line of agricultural production is not only beneficial to agricultural production but also beneficial to the development of other tasks; it also shows that it is correct to implement the principle of "overall planning, comprehensive consideration, ensuring key points (agriculture), and grain first" in adjusting labor, which is in line with the requirements of vigorously developing agriculture and grain.

    根据发展生产的需要及时调整和安排劳动力
    常登榜
    根据发展生产的需要，合理地安排使用劳动力，是农村人民公社的一项经常的重要工作。认真做好这项工作，就能够有效地促进农业生产持续跃进。
    解放以来，福建省闽侯县城门公社和全国各地一样，随着农业合作化和人民公社化的实现，生产关系不断改变，对劳动力的使用和安排曾作过许多次的调整，而每一次的调整，都有效地促进了生产的发展。以该社的敖峰大队为例，土改前一家一户单独生产时，粮食亩产只有六百五十斤；到互助组阶段，实行了互助劳动，单位产量就增长了23％；举办了农业生产合作社，劳动力的集中使用有了进一步发展，并根据劳力强弱、技术高低，作到了人尽其才，因此，粮食单产又提高了40％。
    人民公社建立以后，在劳动力的分配使用上，不仅能够在农业内部更科学、更合理地统一调度，而且能够按照以粮为纲、农林牧副渔同时并举的方针，在各行各业内调整使用劳动力；同时大批妇女从家务劳动中解放了出来，使全社增添了三千多个劳动力，为分配使用劳动力提供了更有利的条件。在公社化后的这一新情况下，我们根据党的以粮为纲、全面发展多种经营的方针，并根据发展农业和人民生活的需要举办一些力所能及的工业的原则，以队为基础，对劳动力作了全面调整，因此，更有效地促进了各项生产的高速度发展。公社成立后的第一年，粮食增产一成四，柑桔变小年为大年，多种经营增长了五倍。近两年来，粮食生产发展的速度更快，现在已变缺粮社为余粮社。这些事实充分说明：适时地、合理地调整劳动力，不仅是一项经常的重要工作，而且是贯彻党的以农业为基础，以粮为纲，全面发展多种经营方针，促进生产持续跃进的一个极其重要的关键问题。
    几年来，虽然农业生产有了高速度的发展，但随着各项社会主义生产建设事业的全面跃进，对农业生产特别是粮食生产提出了新的更高的要求。要迅速发展农业生产，生产更多的粮食，就需要有足够的劳动力。当然，提高劳动效率、高速度发展农业生产的根本出路是加速农业技术改造，实现机械化，但这要有一个过程。在我们今天农业生产技术水平还很低的情况下，要大幅度地增产粮食等农业产品，主要的还是依靠人力劳动。再从农业本身的要求来看，在贯彻多种多收和高产多收相结合的方针中，随着农业“八字宪法”的全面贯彻，精耕细作的程度不断提高，对劳动力的需要量也大为增加。这就要求相应地增加农业生产第一线的劳动力，以保证农业生产大发展的需要。此外，就目前农业劳动力的安排使用情况来看，也还存在一些问题，比如有的部门调用农业的劳动力过多，占用的主要劳动力多了一些；有的生产单位由于缺乏经验，分工过细过死，如有的大队即有畜牧、蔬菜、花果、养鱼、运输和副业等十几个专业队，而且这些专业队又强调专业性，分兵把口，调动不灵，造成了劳动力的浪费和使用不合理的现象，致使从事粮食生产的劳动力不论数量上或质量上都得不到满足。这一切，都要求我们坚定不移地按照以农业为基础，以粮为纲、全面发展多种经营的方针，对劳动力进一步作合理的调整，以保证农业生产特别是粮食生产的高速度发展。
    目前，从公社内部各个方面、各个部门抽调一批劳动力增强农业生产第一线，不仅是必要的，而且是完全可以办到的。几年来，随着技术革新、技术革命运动的广泛深入开展，不论社办、队办工业、企业或是食堂等后勤部门，机械化、半机械化程度和劳动效率都大大提高了，目前已有可能用较少的劳动力完成更多的生产任务。这样，就可以在一些部门、单位中调出一批劳力，加强农业生产第一线。同时，公社化后，生产、生活集体化程度大大提高，农村商业购销业务比过去更为集中，这样，商业网点也就能够根据这个新的情况实行合理布局，腾出一些劳力充实农业生产第一线。过去举办的一些农田基本建设工程，主要工程已经基本完成，这些工程调用的管理干部和劳动力，绝大部分可以调整到农业生产第一线。有些专业部门、单位，在劳动力的组织使用上，已积累了丰富的经验，经过合理安排，实行综合使用，也可以腾出大批劳动力回到农业生产第一线。所有这些都为合理安排劳动力，进一步挖掘劳动潜力充实农业战线提供了条件。
    城门公社党委在分析集中劳动力加强农业生产第一线的可能性的同时，也看到农村劳动力的分配和使用包含着极为复杂的关系。如粮食和林、牧、副、渔各业的关系；当前生产和基本建设的关系；农业生产第一线和后勤工作的关系；农业和社、队工业的关系；农业和财贸、文教事业的关系；以及脱离生产、半脱离生产干部应占的比例关系等等。如何科学合理地处理这些复杂的关系呢？公社党委会根据以农业为基础，以粮为纲、全面发展多种经营的方针，根据人民公社工农商学兵五位一体的特点，确定了“全面规划，统筹兼顾，保证重点（农业），粮食第一”的原则，采用放手发动群众，开展了调整劳动力加强农业生产第一线的群众运动，通过边规划、边行动、边安排的办法，从各个生产部门、各个方面调整出一批劳动力，加强了农业生产第一线。
    对社、队办的工厂、企业，按照主要是为农业服务，并兼顾为群众生活、大工业、出口服务的原则，进行了调整。经过各方面的调整，仅社、队办的工厂中就抽出一千一百多个劳动力充实农业生产第一线。
    在农业劳动组织形式上实行以综合经营为主，组织必要的专业队经营为辅的办法，对一些没有季节限制，没有忙闲差别，又具有特殊技术性的生产，如苗圃、集体办的畜牧业等，固定少数人专业经营；对季节性强，忙闲淡旺差别大，生产技术又容易掌握的生产（如果树、副业等）实行综合经营，这就充分发挥了劳动潜力，大大节省了劳动力。如敖峰大队原有畜牧、苗圃、果树、运输、蔬菜、副业等六个专业队，占用劳动力一百三十多人，经调整后，仅保留畜牧和苗圃两个专业队，腾出了近一百个劳力加强了农业生产第一线，既增加了粮食生产的力量，又兼顾了多种经营、全面发展的需要。
    商业部门则根据服务生产、促进生产、便利群众、有利购销业务开展的原则，调整了商业网，共节约了六十七个劳动力。食堂等后勤部门和文教卫生等部门，根据业务的特点，根据需要与可能，充分利用了半劳力和辅助劳力。
    此外，城门公社还把公社、大队一级的领导机构，作了相应的调整，抽调出二十多个大队以上的领导骨干，下放到生产小队，参加生产领导生产，既大大加强了第一线的领导力量，改进了领导作风，又密切了干部和群众的关系。
    经过全面调整之后，全社从各个方面集中了二千多个劳动力到农业战线，使农业生产第一线的劳动力增加到占总劳动力的80％以上。
    城门公社把可以集中的劳动力集中到农业生产第一线以后，进一步加强了政治思想教育工作，改善了各个生产单位和作业小组的劳动组织，建立与健全了劳动管理、生产责任制度；认真执行了“三包一奖”、评工记分办法，和按劳分配政策，并继续大抓工具改革，大闹技术革新，做好生活安排、劳逸结合等工作，从而进一步调动了广大社员的劳动生产积极性，使大办农业、大办粮食的群众运动迅速推向高潮。在秋季超产运动中，晚稻追施了一次穗肥，及时扑灭了几十年来罕有的“行军虫”，对甘薯普遍进行了一次除草追肥；秋收和冬种准备工作都做得既快又好，冬种基肥较去年同期增加90％。多种经营和副业生产大有起色，柑桔树培土较往年提前了一个季节，施肥量也增加了三至五成。9月份的副业收入比8月份增加了80％。今年冬种计划已落实到田，较去年扩大60％，其中粮食作物扩大30％。这些事实说明，根据生产发展需要，及时合理调整使用劳动力，就能够促进生产的进一步发展，同时也证明党提出的集中劳动力加强农业生产第一线的措施是完全正确的。
    有的同志曾经顾虑集中劳力加强农业生产第一线会影响其他事业的发展。实践证明，这种顾虑是不必要的。在把主要劳动力集中到农业生产第一线后，不仅农业生产搞得好，而且其他各业也出现了“减人大增产，人少办大事”的前所未有的新局面。敖峰大队改变专业分工过细过死的现象后，既使农业生产第一线的劳力增加了一百多人，又促进了其他多种经营的全面跃进。全队突击五天，为柑桔树积河泥十万多担，扩种蔬菜六十多亩；加工白粘土一个月的收入等于过去三个月的收入；农具修配站提早完成了“三秋”所需农具的修配任务；商业部门收购猪、鸡、鸭的任务也都超额完成了。
    以上事实充分说明，集中劳力加强农业生产第一线，不仅有利于农业生产，也有利其他各项工作的开展；也说明在调整劳力上，贯彻执行“全面规划、统筹兼顾、保证重点（农业），粮食第一”这一原则是正确的，是符合大办农业、大办粮食要求的。（注：此文和《合理分配和使用劳动力》一文，均系福建《红与专》编辑部供稿）
