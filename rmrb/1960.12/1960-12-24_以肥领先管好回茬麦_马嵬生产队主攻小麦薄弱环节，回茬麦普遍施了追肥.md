Taking Fertilizer as the Lead to Manage Replanted Wheat Well
Mawei Production Team Focuses on Weak Links in Wheat, Universally Applying Topdressing to Replanted Wheat

(Our dispatch) The Mawei Production Team of Mawei Commune in Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, taking fertilizer as the commander, first managed the replanted wheat. All 3,412 mu of replanted wheat received one topdressing application.

The Mawei Production Team planted a total of 4,615 mu of wheat, of which 3,412 mu were replanted wheat. Soon after emergence, many replanted wheat seedlings showed congenital deficiencies such as yellowing and weakness. What was the reason? How to remedy it? According to the analysis of experienced farmers and technicians, there were five reasons for the yellowing and weakness of some replanted wheat seedlings this year: First, there was more rain in the later period of autumn, which quickly dissolved the fertilizer applied to the autumn fields, resulting in insufficient soil fertility; Second, due to the heavy workload and tight schedule of autumn harvest during the replanting of wheat, there was no time to apply base fertilizer; Third, more than 1,400 mu of new, fertilizer-loving varieties were planted this year; Fourth, 400 mu of replanted wheat were planted by hoeing before the previous crop was harvested, resulting in more floating seeds and shallow rooting; Fifth, 800 mu of replanted wheat were planted after the Cold Dew solar term, resulting in weak seedlings, small roots, and few tillers. The inspection team organized by the Party branch, based on the analysis of experienced farmers and technicians, divided all the replanted wheat into three categories according to the number of tillers. Those with two to three tillers were classified as first-class seedlings; those with one to two tillers were classified as second-class seedlings; and those with no tillers were classified as third-class seedlings.

Once the reasons for the yellowing and weakness of the replanted wheat seedlings were found, the Party branch immediately announced the above situation to the commune members, mobilizing everyone to come up with ideas and clever plans to help the replanted wheat catch up with the regular wheat. The unanimous opinion of the commune members was: fertilizer should be the commander, and replanted wheat should be managed first and managed well; different treatments should be given according to the characteristics, such as: the "Nanda 2419" wheat, which loves fertilizer, is spring-sensitive, and not resistant to freezing, should be fertilized with pig manure, so 10,000 jin of pig manure were applied per mu; the "6028" wheat, which is not cold-resistant and planted in low-lying areas, should be fertilized with sheep and chicken manure, so sheep and chicken manure were applied; for late-sown wheat with few tillers, quick-acting human urine is good, so it was泼 (pō, splashed); the black loess soil is hard, and the wheat seedlings are young, so ash soil fertilizer or humic acid soil fertilizer should be applied, which can loosen the soil, strengthen the seedlings, and promote the development of young seedlings. In terms of the order of fertilization, everyone believed that it should be late-sown wheat and wheat planted by hoeing first, then black loess soil, and finally the "6028" variety and wheat fields in low-lying areas. The commune members put forward four suggestions on how to apply the fertilizer well. First, follow the same track with the carts to avoid trampling damage; second, use wooden shovels instead of iron shovels when spreading fertilizer to avoid harming the wheat seedlings; third, break up the manure clods to prevent壓苗(yā miáo, smothering the seedlings); fourth, when spreading humic acid soil fertilizer, it is best to do it at noon or in the afternoon when there is no dew, and spread it between the rows of wheat to prevent corrosion of the wheat leaves.

After these methods were summarized and refined by the Party branch, they were fully deliberated and mobilized from top to bottom. A campaign to apply more, faster, and more skillfully fertilizer to replanted wheat quickly took shape. All 620 laborers in the team worked together, and 31 large carts and 171 pushcarts were dispatched. If the existing fertilizer of many small teams was not enough, they would search for and produce fertilizer, and purchase household fertilizer from commune members in cash based on the principle of equivalent exchange. The team's ten small soil fertilizer plants produced 1,000 jin of soil fertilizer every day to supply topdressing. By December 12, all the replanted wheat in the team had received a warm seedling fertilizer application. Now, the team has concentrated its forces to start applying topdressing to the regular wheat, and to irrigate, prevent insects, and weed the replanted wheat. (Attached picture)

    以肥领先管好回茬麦
    马嵬生产队主攻小麦薄弱环节，回茬麦普遍施了追肥
    本报讯　陕西兴平县马嵬公社马嵬生产队以肥料为帅，先管回茬麦，三千四百一十二亩回茬麦，亩亩施上了一次追肥。
    马嵬生产队共种小麦四千六百一十五亩，其中回茬麦三千四百一十二亩。不少回茬麦出苗不久，就呈现苗黄苗弱的先天不足现象。原因何在？怎样补救？按照老农和技术员的分析，今年有些回茬麦发生苗黄苗弱的原因有五：一、秋季后期阴雨多，给秋田所施肥料很快溶解，地力不足；二、回茬麦播种时秋收工作量大，时间紧迫，没来得及施底肥；三、今年增种了一千四百多亩喜肥的新品种；四、有四百亩回茬麦是在前茬作物未收时锄种的，浮籽多、扎根浅；五、有八百亩回茬麦是在寒露过后播种的，苗弱根小分蘖少。党支部组织的检查团根据老农和技术员的分析，又把所有回茬麦按分蘖多少划分了三类。凡分蘖二至三个的为一类苗；一至二个的为二类苗，没有分蘖的是三类苗。
    回茬麦苗黄苗弱的原因找到了，党支部立即把上述情况向社员宣布，动员大家为回茬赶正茬出主意，献妙计。社员们一致的意见是：要以肥为帅，先管、狠管回茬；要根据特点分别对待，如：喜肥、春性强、不耐冻的“南大二四一九”麦，施猪粪好，就每亩施猪粪万斤；低洼地种的不耐寒的“六○二八号”小麦，施羊、鸡粪好，就施了羊、鸡粪；播种迟的、分蘖少的麦，见效快的人尿好，就用尿泼；黑垆土地土质硬，麦苗幼小，就施灰土粪或胡敏酸土化肥，能松土壮苗，促进小苗发育。在施肥次序上，大家认为应该是先晚播的、锄种的，再黑垆土，最后六○二八号品种和低洼地麦田。用什么办法施好，社员们提出了四条意见。一、车辗一条辙，不乱开路，减少踏损；二、撒肥时用木锨不用铁锨，以免伤害麦苗；三、粪块要打碎，防止压苗；四、撒胡敏酸土化肥，最好在中午、下午没露水时，撒在麦行间，防止腐蚀麦叶。
    这些办法经过党支部总结归纳以后，又从上到下作了充分酝酿、动员。一个给回茬麦多施、快施、巧施肥的运动，很快就形成了。全队六百二十名劳力一齐动手，三十一辆大车和一百七十一辆架子车等一齐出动。不少小队现存的肥料不够，就搜肥、造肥，根据等价交换的原则，现钱收买社员的家肥。全队十一个小土化肥厂为了供应追肥，每天生产土化肥一千斤。到12月12日，全队所有回茬麦都上了一次暖苗肥。现在这个队已集中兵力开始给正茬麦施追肥，给回茬麦灌水、防虫、锄草。（附图片）
