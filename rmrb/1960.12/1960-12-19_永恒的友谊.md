Eternal Friendship
Major General Zhang Ruihuan, Head of the Korean People's Army Ensemble

    This year, on October 25th, the people and armies of Korea and China grandly commemorated the 10th anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the war, a festival symbolizing the friendship and solidarity between the two peoples and armies. On this significant occasion, the Korean People's Army Ensemble, at the invitation of the Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China, visited our close neighbor, the People's Republic of China, carrying the deep friendship of the Korean people and the Korean People's Army towards the Chinese people, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the former officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    During our forty-plus day visit to China, under the warm care and meticulous attention of the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and the government, headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, we successfully conducted performance activities and fulfilled our task of helping to strengthen the traditional friendship and solidarity between the Korean and Chinese peoples and armies.

    Our performances in eleven cities, including Beijing, received a warm welcome and high praise from the fraternal Chinese people and officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

    Particularly unforgettable was October 30th, when the beloved leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and other leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and the government watched our performance at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing and cordially received us.

    On that day, Chairman Mao Zedong and other leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and the government, after watching our performance, praised our national art, which is flourishing under the constant care and wise leadership of our Party and our respected leader, Comrade Kim Il-sung. They especially praised the high ideological and artistic quality of our art, which educates our people and officers and soldiers of the People's Army with an indomitable revolutionary spirit and revolutionary optimism, and they encouraged us.

    During our visit to China, we felt even more deeply how profound the friendship of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army towards the Korean people and officers and soldiers of the People's Army is.

    Everyone received us with the warm feelings of long-separated comrades-in-arms and brothers. Wherever we went, whether it was streets and villages, factories and enterprises, the front lines in Fujian, or outposts, it was like a joyous festival.

    What was particularly unforgettable for us were the moving days we spent with the people of the Fujian front and the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army's army, navy, and air force. The soldiers on the Fujian front welcomed us as close comrades-in-arms. We danced hand-in-hand with them on the coastal positions and outposts facing Jinmen Island, which is occupied by the U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, in trenches and tunnels, and sang of the eternal friendship between Korea and China.

    The leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and the government expressed their sincere respect to Comrade Kim Il-sung, who led the anti-Japanese guerrilla forces in fifteen years of heroic armed struggle against the common enemy, Japanese imperialism, together with Chinese comrades. They unanimously wished Comrade Premier a long life and sincerely rejoiced in the great achievements made by the Korean people in socialist construction under the wise leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, as if they were their own achievements.

    Every former officer and soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers we met said with tears in their eyes that although they had withdrawn from Korea two years ago, they still could not forget the fraternal love and assistance of the Korean Workers' Party and the government of the Republic, as well as the Korean people, headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung.

    At the same time, they expressed their immense joy that the cities and villages of Korea, which they had defended with their blood alongside the Korean People's Army in the past, had completely healed the wounds of war and were standing taller and more beautiful, and that the entire Korean people had achieved great successes in socialist construction with the spirit of riding the Chollima.

    We firmly believe that this is not only the feeling of a few former officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, but also the unanimous feeling of the entire Chinese people.

    Korean-Chinese friendship is deeply rooted in the lives of our two peoples and is becoming more consolidated and developed with the passage of time.

    Through this visit to China, we have deeply realized that the relationship of friendship forged in blood between the peoples and armies of Korea and China is indestructible by any force and is invincible.

    The relationship of friendship between the peoples and armies of Korea and China is a fraternal relationship based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. It is the closest relationship of comrades-in-arms, forged in blood and tested through arduous trials in the long-term common struggle against imperialism.

    During the long and arduous days of struggle against Japanese imperialism, Korean communists launched a common struggle alongside Chinese comrades, laying a solid foundation for the proletarian internationalist friendship between our two peoples and armies.

    This traditional friendship and solidarity was consolidated and developed during the Fatherland Liberation War against U.S. imperialist aggression, becoming even more unbreakable.

    During the most difficult period of our Fatherland Liberation War, the Chinese people, holding high the banner of "Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea, Protecting Our Homes and Defending Our Country," organized volunteers with their outstanding sons and daughters and sent them to the Korean front to aid the Korean people with their blood.

    The heroic fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers loved the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Korean Workers' Party, and the Korean people as if they were their own homeland, their own Party, and their own people, faithfully implementing the instructions of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong to cherish every mountain, river, tree, and blade of grass in Korea.

    The power of the unity between the peoples and armies of Korea and China caused the U.S. imperialists, the ringleaders of imperialism and the most ferocious enemies of mankind, to suffer their first shameful defeat in their history of aggression, shattered the myth of the "strength" of U.S. imperialism, and defended peace in the Far East and the world.

    The friendship and solidarity between the Korean and Chinese peoples have been further consolidated and developed in the struggle for socialist construction in our two countries, and have brilliantly demonstrated its invincible vitality.

    Today, the peoples and armies of Korea and China have displayed a true example of proletarian internationalist friendship and solidarity by providing comprehensive support to each other, learning from each other, and encouraging each other.

    The strengthening of the traditional friendship and cooperation between our two peoples promotes the common prosperity of both countries, while making a great contribution to strengthening the unity and power of the socialist camp and making a glorious contribution to the cause of defending peace in the Far East and the world.

    This friendship and solidarity between our two peoples and armies will become more consolidated with the passage of time, and it is eternal.

    During our visit to China, we were immensely excited to see the great achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction.

    Today, the Chinese people are united like steel around the Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, holding high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and leaping forward again and again, achieving brilliant successes in socialist construction.

    Last year, China's industrial production increased to 12.9 times that of 1949, and agricultural production increased to 2.7 times.

    On the vast Chinese mainland, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the 650 million Chinese people, mobilized by the Great Leap Forward movement of socialist construction, is surging.

    The fraternal Chinese people have achieved the tremendous achievement of completing the production targets for major industrial products of the Second Five-Year Plan in just two years last year.

    The Chinese people, who were once technologically backward, have today become the proud masters of advanced technology, achieving great successes in the technological revolution.

    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, socialist New China has cultivated many worker-peasant red technicians and experts, and the flames of technological innovation are burning everywhere. The mass movement of automation, semi-automation, mechanization, and semi-mechanization has swept across large, medium, and small factories throughout the country.

    Socialism has triumphed completely not only in China's cities but also in the countryside. The face of the countryside has fundamentally changed.

    Chinese peasants are united in the big family of the People's Communes.

    This year, although China encountered considerable natural disasters, the Chinese peasants, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and relying on the strong organizational strength of the People's Communes, successfully overcame the disasters and achieved great success in agriculture.

    The entire Chinese people are filled with strong confidence in a bright future and pride in their great cause, and their lives are filled with vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm.

    They are launching innovations in every sector of socialist construction every day, leaping forward to build a strong socialist New China with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.

    The tremendous achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction and the rapidly growing power of the Chinese people are a great contribution to further strengthening the world's socialist forces and a heavy blow to the imperialists headed by U.S. imperialism.

    All these achievements of the Chinese people are the result of the entire Chinese people being firmly united around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, overcoming all difficulties, and carrying out a resolute struggle.

    During our visit to China, we were as happy and inspired by every achievement of the Chinese people as if it were our own, and we further firmly believe that the fraternal Chinese people will achieve even greater victories in the future.

    We also clearly saw that our close comrades-in-arms, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, are vigilantly defending their socialist motherland, growing stronger and becoming a powerful modern armed force capable of eliminating any imperialist aggressor.

    Today, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is rapidly strengthening and developing into a powerful armed force of the army, navy, and air force equipped with advanced military technology, a modern army with highly conscious discipline, orderly, and lively style.

    While defending the socialist motherland, they continue to participate in socialist construction, thinking of everything for the country's socialist construction, living a frugal life, and vigorously engaging in sideline production within the troops.

    The officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army maintain a tense combat posture, victoriously smashing the hostile provocative actions repeatedly carried out by U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, reliably defending the victorious fruits of socialism, and are filled with the determination to liberate Taiwan and confidence in the final victory.

    We firmly believe that the Chinese people and the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army will surely be able to defeat the aggression of U.S. imperialism and complete the cause of liberating their sacred territory, Taiwan.

    We are infinitely happy and proud to have such a revolutionary army as our close comrade-in-arms, the glorious Chinese People's Liberation Army with a long history of struggle and revolutionary tradition, and to stand with them on the eastern outpost of the socialist camp.

    We clearly see that the Chinese people and the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are filled with determination to wage a resolute struggle to finally crush the aggressive schemes of U.S. imperialism in the East, to establish lasting peace, and for the victory of socialism.

    The Chinese people condemn with great anger and hatred the U.S. imperialist aggressive schemes of forcibly occupying the southern half of our country and seriously threatening peace in Korea and the Far East, and express fraternal sympathy and support for the Korean people's struggle to achieve the peaceful reunification of their country.

    The arch-criminal of world reaction, U.S. imperialism, is the irreconcilable enemy of the Korean and Chinese peoples and the ferocious enemy of the people of the world.

    U.S. imperialism forcibly occupies the southern half of our country and China's inseparable territory, Taiwan, continues to carry out threatening military provocations against our two peoples, and openly carries out brazen acts of aggression in South Vietnam and Laos, in Cuba and the Congo, and everywhere in the world.

    All this truly proves that the wolfish nature of U.S. imperialism will never and cannot be changed, and shows that there can be no illusion about imperialism.

    The peoples and armies of Korea and China, directly confronting U.S. imperialism, cannot relax their vigilance for a moment and must constantly expose and crush the aggressive schemes of U.S. imperialism.

    Through long historical experience, the peoples of Korea and China have deeply realized that peace and national independence cannot be won by surrendering to imperialism, but must be won by struggle.

    The peoples and armies of Korea and China firmly maintain the posture of repelling the aggression of the imperialists headed by U.S. imperialism at any time and resolutely defending the freedom and independence of their countries and peace in the Far East and the world.

    U.S. imperialism must remember the lesson of the shameful defeat it suffered under the united forces of the Korean and Chinese peoples in the past Korean War.

    Today, the power of the peoples and armies of Korea and China is incomparably stronger than it was ten years ago when U.S. imperialism provoked the Korean War.

    The era in which imperialists arbitrarily plundered the Eastern peoples is gone forever.

    As clearly pointed out in the statement of the meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties held in Moscow not long ago, our era is the era of socialist revolution and national liberation revolution, the era of the collapse of imperialism and the elimination of the colonial system, the era in which more and more people are embarking on the path of socialism, and the era of the victory of socialism and communism worldwide.

    Today, the socialist system has become the decisive force determining the main direction and content of historical development, and the power of the socialist camp decisively overwhelms the imperialist forces of war.

    In Asian, African, and Latin American countries, the flames of national liberation struggles are burning even more fiercely, the colonial system has been fundamentally shaken, and the forces of peace-loving people around the world have been unprecedentedly strengthened.

    U.S. imperialists must face up to all these developments in the world today.

    If U.S. imperialists continue to carry out foolish acts of aggression and provocation against the Korean and Chinese peoples, it can only hasten its own demise.

    The friendship and solidarity between the Korean and Chinese peoples and armies, united in the big family of the socialist camp, is one of the important guarantees for the Korean people's victory in the struggle for the peaceful reunification of their country and socialism.

    The Korean people and officers and soldiers of the People's Army will firmly unite with the people of the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries of the socialist camp, unite with all progressive humanity around the world, continue to resolutely fight against U.S. imperialism, and must strive to achieve the great cause of peacefully reunifying the motherland.

    The just common struggle of the Korean and Chinese peoples to crush the aggressive schemes of U.S. imperialism, defend peace in the Far East and the world, and complete the cause of socialism and communism will surely achieve final victory.

    永恒的友谊
    朝鲜人民军协奏团团长　张瑞焕少将
    今年10月25日，朝中两国人民和军队盛大地纪念了作为两国人民和军队间的友谊团结的节日的中国人民志愿军参战十周年。在这个意义深厚的日子里，朝鲜人民军协奏团应中华人民共和国国防部的邀请，满载着朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军对中国人民、中国人民解放军和前中国人民志愿军官兵们的深厚友情访问了我们的亲密邻邦——中华人民共和国。
    我们在中国访问的四十多天内，在以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党和政府领导人的温暖的照顾和无微不至的关怀下，胜利地进行了演出活动，完成了有助于加强朝中人民和军队间的传统友谊团结的自己的任务。
    我们在北京等十一个城市进行的演出，得到了兄弟般的中国人民和中国人民解放军官兵们的热烈欢迎，并得到了高度的评价。
    特别令人难忘的是10月30日，中国人民的敬爱的领袖毛泽东主席等中国共产党和政府领导人在北京人民大会堂观看了我们的演出，并亲切地接见了我们。
    这一天，毛泽东主席等中国共产党和政府领导人观看了我们的演出后，赞扬了在我们党和敬爱的领袖金日成同志的不断的关怀和英明领导下蓬勃发展的我们民族艺术，特别赞扬了以不屈不挠的革命精神和革命乐观主义教育我们人民和人民军官兵的我们艺术的高度的思想性和艺术性，并鼓舞了我们。
    我们在访问中国期间更加深刻地感受了中国人民和中国人民解放军对朝鲜人民和人民军官兵的友谊之情是多么深厚的。
    每个人都以久别重逢的战友和兄弟的骨肉般的友谊之情接待了我们，我们每到之处，不管是街道和村庄、工厂和企业、福建前线阵地和前哨，到处都像欢腾的节日一样。
    使我们特别难忘的是同福建前线人民和中国人民解放军陆海空军官兵一起度过的动人的日子。福建前线的战士们把我们当作亲密的战友狂热地欢迎了我们，我们在面对着美帝国主义和蒋介石集团盘踞着的金门岛的海岸阵地和哨位上、在堑壕和坑道中同他们手拉着手跳了舞，歌唱了永恒的朝中友谊。
    中国共产党和政府领导人对领导抗日游击队同中国同志一道为反对共同的敌人日本帝国主义进行了十五年英勇的武装斗争的金日成同志表示了热诚的敬意，一致祝贺首相同志万寿无疆，并把朝鲜人民在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党的英明领导下在社会主义建设中取得的巨大成就真心地当作自己的成就一样地高兴。
    我们所见到的前中国人民志愿军官兵，无论是谁都含着眼泪激动地说，从朝鲜撤军两年了，但至今忘不了以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府以及朝鲜人民的兄弟的爱戴和援助。
    同时，他们对过去同朝鲜人民军一道以鲜血保卫的朝鲜的城市和村庄完全医好战争创伤，更美丽更宏伟地矗立起来，对全体朝鲜人民以跨上千里马的气概在社会主义建设中取得的巨大成就表示无比的高兴。
    我们坚信这不仅是几位前中国人民志愿军官兵的心情，而且是全体中国人民一致的心情。
    朝中友谊在我们两国人民的生活中根深蒂固，并随着日月的推进更加巩固发展。
    我们通过这次访问中国，更加深刻地感到了朝中两国人民和军队间以鲜血结成的友谊关系，是任何力量也破坏不了的，是战无不胜的。
    朝中两国人民和军队间的友谊关系，是基于马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则的兄弟关系，是在反对帝国主义的长期的共同斗争中以鲜血结成的并经过了严峻考验的最亲密战友关系。
    在反对日本帝国主义的长期的艰苦的斗争日子里，朝鲜的共产主义者同中国同志并肩展开了共同斗争，打下了我们两国人民和军队间的无产阶级国际主义友谊关系的牢固基础。
    这一传统的友谊团结，在反对美帝国主义侵略的我们祖国解放战争时期，得到了巩固发展，成为更加牢不可破的了。
    中国人民在我们祖国解放战争过程的最艰苦的时期，高举“抗美援朝保家卫国”的旗帜，以自己的优秀儿女组织了志愿军，派往朝鲜前线，以鲜血援助朝鲜人民。
    中国人民志愿军勇士们像对自己的祖国、自己的党和自己人民一样地热爱朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜人民，忠实地执行了中国共产党和毛泽东主席的关于爱护朝鲜的一山一水、一草一木的指示。
    朝中两国人民和军队的团结的威力使帝国主义头子、人类最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义者遭到了它的侵略历史上第一次可耻的惨败，粉碎了关于美帝国主义“强大”的神话，保卫了远东和世界的和平。
    朝中人民间的友谊团结在我们两国的社会主义建设的斗争中更加巩固发展了，并光辉地显示了它的不可战胜的生命力。
    今天，朝中两国人民和军队显示了互相全面支援、互相学习和鼓舞的真正的无产阶级国际主义友谊团结的榜样。
    我们两国人民间的传统友谊和合作的加强，促进了两国的共同繁荣，同时对加强社会主义阵营的团结一致和威力作出巨大的贡献，并为保卫远东和世界和平的事业作出光辉的贡献。
    我们两国人民和军队间的这种友谊和团结将随着日月的推进而更加巩固，它是永恒的。
    我们在访问中国期间，无比兴奋地看到了中国人民在社会主义建设中取得的巨大成就。
    今天，中国人民钢铁般地团结在以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党的周围，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗跃进再跃进，在社会主义建设中取得了辉煌的成就。
    去年，中国工业生产增加到了1949年的十二点九倍，农业生产增加到了二点七倍。
    在广阔的中国大陆上沸腾着被社会主义建设的大跃进运动动员起来的六亿五千万中国人民的革命热情。
    兄弟般的中国人民取得了在去年就仅以两年的时间完成第二个五年计划主要工业产品产量指标的巨大成就。
    过去曾是技术落后的中国人民，今天成为堂堂的先进技术的主人，在技术革命中取得了巨大成就。
    社会主义新中国在中国共产党领导下，培养了许多工农红色技术人员和专家，到处都燃烧着技术革新的火焰。自动化、半自动化、机械化、半机械化的群众运动席卷了全国的大中小工厂。
    社会主义不仅在中国的城市，而且在农村也完全胜利了。农村的面貌根本改变了。
    中国农民团结在人民公社的大家庭中了。
    今年，中国虽然遇到了不小的自然灾害，中国农民在中国共产党的领导下，依靠人民公社的强大的组织力量，胜利地克服了灾害，在农业方面取得了巨大的成就。
    全体中国人民充满着对光明的未来的坚强的信心和对自己的伟大的事业的自豪感，在他们的生活中到处都跃动着生气勃勃的革命热情。
    他们在社会主义建设的每个部门天天掀起革新，为建设成为一个具有现代化工业、现代化农业和现代化科学文化的富强的社会主义新中国而跃进着。
    中国人民在社会主义建设中取得的巨大的成就和迅速壮大的中国人民的威力，是对进一步加强世界社会主义力量的巨大贡献，是对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义者的沉重的打击。
    中国人民的这一切成就，是全体中国人民牢固地团结在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的周围，克服了一切困难，进行了坚决的斗争而取得的。
    我们在访问中国期间，对中国人民取得的每项成就就像自己的成就一样地感到欢欣鼓舞，并进一步坚信兄弟般的中国人民今后将取得更大的胜利。
    我们还清楚地看到，我们的亲密的战友——中国人民解放军警惕地保卫着自己的社会主义祖国，更加壮大成为能够消灭任何帝国主义侵略者的强有力的现代武装力量。
    中国人民解放军今天迅速加强和发展成为具有先进军事技术武装的陆海空军的强有力的武装力量、有高度自觉的纪律、秩序井然的、灵敏活泼的风格的现代化军队。
    他们一方面保卫社会主义祖国，一方面继续参加社会主义建设，一切为国家的社会主义建设着想，过俭朴的生活，在部队内大力搞副业生产。
    中国人民解放军官兵坚持紧张的战斗姿态，胜利地粉碎着美帝国主义和蒋介石集团一再进行着的敌对的挑衅行动，可靠地保卫着社会主义胜利果实，并充满着一定要解放台湾的决心和对最后胜利的信心。
    我们坚信中国人民和中国人民解放军官兵一定能够打败美帝国主义的侵略，完成解放自己的神圣领土——台湾的事业。
    我们为有具有悠久的斗争历史和革命传统的光荣的中国人民解放军这样的革命军队作为自己的亲密战友，并同他们一起站在社会主义阵营的东方前哨而感到无限的欢欣和骄傲。
    我们清楚地看到，中国人民和中国人民解放军官兵充满决心为了在东方最后粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，为了建立持久和平，为了社会主义的胜利而进行坚决的斗争。
    中国人民以巨大的愤怒和憎恨谴责美帝国主义强占我们祖国的南半部严重威胁朝鲜和远东的和平的侵略阴谋，并对朝鲜人民争取祖国的和平统一的斗争表示兄弟般的同情和支持。
    世界反动的元凶——美帝国主义是朝中两国人民的不共戴天的敌人，是全世界人民的凶恶的敌人。
    美帝国主义强占着我们祖国的南半部和中国的不可分割的领土——台湾，继续进行着反对我们两国人民的威胁性的军事挑衅，在南越和老挝，在古巴和刚果，在世界各地公然进行厚颜无耻的侵略行动。
    这一切如实地证明美帝国主义的狼的本性决不会也不可能改变，并说明对帝国主义不能有一丝一毫的幻想。
    同美帝国主义直接对峙着的朝中两国人民和军队一刻也不能放松警惕，必须时刻揭露和粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋。
    朝中两国人民通过长期的历史经验，深刻地体会到和平和民族独立不能用向帝国主义屈服的方法来争取，而必须用斗争来争取。
    朝中两国人民和军队坚定地保持着在任何时候击退以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义者的侵略、坚决保卫祖国的自由独立和远东、世界和平的姿态。
    美帝国主义必须记取在过去的朝鲜战争中在朝中两国人民的团结起来的力量下遭到可耻的失败的教训。
    今天，朝中两国人民和军队的威力比十年前美帝国主义挑起侵朝战争时无比地强大了。
    帝国主义者任意掠夺东方人民的时代已经永远过去了。
    如同不久前在莫斯科举行的各国共产党和工人党代表会议声明中所明白指出的，我们的时代——是社会主义革命和民族解放革命的时代，是帝国主义崩溃、殖民主义体系消灭的时代，是越来越多的人民走上社会主义道路、社会主义和共产主义在全世界范围内胜利的时代。
    今天，社会主义体系成为规定历史发展的主要方向和内容的决定性的力量，社会主义阵营的威力决定性地压倒帝国主义战争势力。
    在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国，民族解放斗争的火焰更加熊熊地燃烧，殖民地体系从根本上动摇了，全世界爱好和平人民的力量空前地增强了。
    美帝国主义者必须正视当前世界上这一切事态的发展。
    美帝国主义者如果继续进行反对朝中人民的愚蠢的侵略挑衅行动，那只能促进它自己的灭亡。
    在社会主义阵营的大家庭中团结在一起的朝中两国人民和军队间的友谊团结是朝鲜人民在为了祖国的和平统一和社会主义的斗争中取得胜利的重要保证之一。
    朝鲜人民和人民军官兵将同苏联、中国和社会主义阵营各兄弟国家人民牢固地团结在一起，同全世界进步人类团结在一起，继续坚决地进行反对美帝国主义的斗争，一定要争取达成和平统一祖国的伟大事业。
    朝中两国人民为了粉碎美帝国主义者的侵略阴谋，保卫远东和世界的和平，完成社会主义和共产主义的事业而进行的正义的共同斗争一定能取得最后胜利。
