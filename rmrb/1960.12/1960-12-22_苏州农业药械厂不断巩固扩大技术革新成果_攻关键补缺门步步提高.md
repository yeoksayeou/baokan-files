(Our newspaper's dispatch from Nanjing, December 21st) The Suzhou Agricultural Machinery Factory, adopting the method of "tackling key problems, filling gaps, and upgrading," consolidates, promotes, and improves technical innovation achievements, greatly increasing labor productivity and reducing raw material consumption, and overfulfills the state plan every month.

In the first half of last year, this factory had only twenty-odd dilapidated lathes, with manual labor accounting for 70%. The entire factory of over one thousand employees only produced one to two thousand sprayers per month. After launching a vigorous technical revolution, it overfulfilled the annual sprayer production task. In the first half of this year, under the leadership of the Party, the employees continued to advance towards mechanization and automation, realizing hundreds of innovation projects, significantly improving the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization, and creating six production lines and twenty-odd automatic and semi-automatic machine tools. However, with the development of production, the state's requirements became higher. The factory not only had to complete the production tasks of old products ahead of schedule but also had to increase the production of tractor-drawn sprayers, manufacture some gasoline engines themselves, and also trial-produce and produce seven-and-a-half-ton water gate hoists and other new products. The addition of these tasks, besides the shortage of manpower and work hours, also brought a series of new problems in terms of materials, equipment, and technical strength. For example, to complete the increased production tasks, it was necessary to increase a batch of thin steel, copper, aluminum, and other materials. To manufacture new products such as water gate hoists, it was necessary to add large lathes and other special equipment to process some special parts.

Faced with these new tasks, the factory's general branch started by grasping ideology, guiding employees to further promote technical innovation. In the discussions, each workshop specifically identified the key to increasing production and saving resources, and also checked the promotion and use of existing innovative machinery. It was found that in addition to the need to tap the potential of materials and equipment through product revolution and process revolution, it was even more necessary to further promote the "four modernizations." Because, on the one hand, some of the existing innovation projects had not been fully used; on the other hand, many processes had not been freed from heavy physical labor. Therefore, each workshop formulated plans to consolidate and promote innovation achievements based on their specific circumstances and widely launched activities of "tackling key problems, filling gaps, and upgrading."

In order to quickly and effectively overcome some major production bottlenecks, the factory, while extensively mobilizing the masses, organized commando teams and "three-in-one" groups, concentrating their efforts to attack key problems. For example, the Third Workshop, in the trial production and production of eight-foot lathes, focused all fitter strength on innovation to address the key problem of insufficient equipment. In a relatively short period, they successfully developed innovative machinery such as lead screw straighteners, movable knife rests, homemade boring machines, and homemade grinding heads, and completed the production tasks in a timely manner. In order to solve the problem of insufficient materials, the factory organized a group of cadres, workers, and technicians to concentrate their efforts on carrying out a product revolution. After the first reform was successful, it was immediately finalized and promoted. The design department organized on-site modifications to the design, the foundry workshop reformed wood molds and castings, and the metal processing department improved tooling, enabling the comprehensive completion of product reform for three types of sprayers. According to the annual production plan, it could save 600 kilograms of copper and more than 60,000 work hours while ensuring good performance.

At the same time, the masses were mobilized to review and compare the original innovation projects item by item, continuing to adhere to the principle of "combining indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous methods as the mainstay," to fill "gaps," fill "blanks," organize supporting facilities, and promote them, so that innovation projects could exert greater power in production. For example, the Fourth Workshop had previously built a production line, but the innovation projects for each process were not fully equipped, and the tinning of the first process and the painting of the last process were still done manually. This time, with the support of the Party General Branch, the innovation "vanguards" Qu Lungen and Hong Guangyao each led an innovation team to carry out a blitzkrieg, successfully experimenting with automatic equipment for tinning and painting, filling the "gaps"; at the same time, the innovation equipment on other processes was also sorted out, and some low-quality parts were replaced, finally forming a more complete mechanized and semi-mechanized production line. The number of workers in the entire workshop was reduced from more than 170 to 58, while the monthly production capacity of compression sprayers increased from 2,000 to more than 20,000 units.

In order to strive for perfection and be even better, they upgraded semi-mechanization to mechanization, and mechanization to semi-automation or automation. In the past three months, twenty-seven important equipment and processes in this factory have met the requirements of "upgrading." For example, the tube drawing group previously used a homemade gantry planer to make a tube drawing machine; however, because the three processes of shearing iron sheets, rolling circles, and sawing tubes were still manual, the production efficiency still could not keep up with the level of the subsequent processes. Veteran worker Zhang Xiangnian, with the help of fraternal work sections, referred to the principle of a noodle rolling machine to make an automatic rolling shear and rolling machine, and added a flexible toothed saw bed to the tube drawing machine, connecting these three machines and the original tube drawing machine into two sets of linkage lines, making tube drawing production leap to semi-automation, greatly improving production efficiency. The number of workers in the entire group was reduced from eight to two, and the output increased three times.

With the development of the "tackling key problems, filling gaps, and upgrading" activities, more than two hundred original innovation projects suitable for production in the factory have been widely used in production, and one hundred and three important innovation projects have been newly realized, filling the "gaps." The factory's production tasks are completed every month. By the end of November, the output of the three types of sprayers, high-pressure, compression, and tractor-drawn, assigned by the state increased by 1.2 times, 1.4 times, and 2.4 times respectively compared with the same period last year, and the tractor-drawn sprayer has completed the annual plan ahead of schedule. In terms of products, new products such as gasoline engines, water gate hoists, and eight-foot lathes have been added. While the factory's output has increased several times, it has also drawn 10% of its workers to support agriculture and key construction projects. The average labor productivity in eleven months increased by 67.4% compared with the same period last year, the product cost decreased by 40%, and raw materials were greatly saved. The thin steel plates saved by compression sprayers alone amounted to more than 60 tons.

    苏州农业药械厂不断巩固扩大技术革新成果
    攻关键补缺门步步提高
    本报南京21日电　苏州农业药械厂，采取“攻关、补缺、升级”的方法，巩固、推广、提高技术革新成果，大大提高了劳动生产率，降低了原材料消耗，月月超额完成了国家计划。
    这个厂在去年上半年只有二十多台破旧车床，手工劳动占到70％，全厂一千多个职工每月只产一、二千台喷雾器。经过大闹技术革命以后，超额完成了全年喷雾器生产任务。今年上半年，职工们在党的领导下，继续向机械化自动化进军，实现了上百项革新项目，机械化半机械化程度显著提高，并且创造了六条生产流水线、二十多台自动化半自动化机床。但是，随着生产的发展，国家的要求更高了，厂里不但要提前完成老产品的生产任务，而且要增加三用机引喷雾器的生产，自制一部分汽油机，还要试制和生产七吨半水闸启闭机等新产品。增加这些任务后，除了人力、工时不足外，还带来了材料、设备、技术力量等方面一系列的新问题。例如，要完成增产任务，就需要增加一批薄钢材、铜、铝等材料。要制造水闸启闭机等新产品，就需要增添大车床等专用设备，来加工一些特殊部件。
    面对这些新任务，厂总支从抓思想着手，引导职工进一步大搞技术革新。在讨论中，各车间都具体排了增产节约关键，也检查了已有革新机具的推广使用情况，发现除了需要通过产品革命、工艺革命，大挖材料、设备等潜力外，更需要进一步大搞“四化”。因为，一方面在已有革新项目中，还有些没有完全使用；一方面还有不少工序未能解除笨重的体力劳动。于是，各车间都根据自己的具体情况，制订了巩固、推广革新成果的计划，广泛展开了“攻关、补缺、升级”的活动。
    为了迅速有效地攻破一些主要生产关键，这个厂在广泛发动群众的同时，组织了攻关突击队、“三结合”小组，集中力量，猛攻关键。比如，三车间在试制和生产八呎车床过程中，针对设备不足的关键，集中全部钳工力量，大搞革新。在比较短的时期里，先后搞成功了丝杆校直器、活动校刀、土镗床、土磨头等革新机具，及时完成了生产任务。为了解决材料不足的问题，这个厂组织了一批干部、工人和技术人员，集中力量大搞产品革命。在第一台改革成功后，立即定型推广。组织设计科在现场修改设计，翻砂车间改革木模、翻改铸件，金加工部门改进工夹具，使三种喷雾器全面完成了产品改革。按全年生产计划计算，可以在保证性能良好的条件下，节省六百公斤铜，六万多个工时。
    与此同时，还发动群众对原有革新项目逐项审查、比较，继续坚持“土洋并举、以土为主”的方针，进行补“缺门”、填“空白”，组织配套和推广，使革新项目在生产上发挥更大威力。像四车间在前一时期早就建成了一条生产流水线，但各道工序的革新项目配得不全，头道工序的搪锡和末道工序的喷漆仍用手工。这次在党总支的支持下，由革新“闯将”瞿兰根、洪光耀分别带领一个革新小组，大搞突击战，试验成功了搪锡和喷漆的自动设备，补齐了“缺门”；同时对其它工序上的革新设备，也进行了整理，调换了一些质量不高的部件，终于配成了一条比较完善的机械化半机械化流水线。全车间工人从一百七十多人减少到五十八人，而压缩喷雾器的月产能力从两千台提高到两万台以上。
    为了精益求精、好上加好，他们把半机械化的升级到机械化，机械化的升级到半自动化或自动化。三个多月来，这个厂已有二十七项重要设备和工艺达到了“升级”的要求。像拉管组前些时用土龙门刨床制成了一种拉管机；但由于剪铁皮、卷圆、锯管等三道工序还是手工操作，生产效率仍然跟不上后道工序的水平，老工人张祥年，在兄弟工段的帮助下，参照轧面机的原理，制成自动滚剪机和卷圆机，在拉管车上加装了活络无齿锯床，把这三种机器和原有拉管机联成了两组联动线，使拉管生产跃升为半自动化，生产效率大大提高，全组工人由八人改为两人，产量提高三倍。
    随着“攻关、补缺、升级”活动的开展，全厂原有适用于生产的两百多项革新项目已经普遍用于生产，还新实现了一百零三项重要革新项目，补齐了“缺门”。全厂生产任务月月完成，国家下达的高压、压缩、机引等三种喷雾器的产量，到11月底止，分别比去年同期增产一点二倍、一点四倍和二点四倍，机引喷雾器已提前完成了全年计划。在产品方面，增加了汽油机、水闸启闭机、八呎车床等新产品。全厂在产量成倍增长的情况下，还抽出10％的工人支援农业和重点建设。十一个月的平均劳动生产率比去年同期提高67.4％，产品成本降低了40％，原材料大大节省，仅压缩喷雾器节约的薄钢板即达六十多吨。
