Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 6th: Chongqing's scientific research departments and universities, based on their own characteristics, are vigorously carrying out technical service activities to bring science and technology to the forefront of industrial and agricultural production, actively assisting various production units in solving key problems in production. According to incomplete statistics, this year, more than three scientific research units and more than ten universities in the city have formed more than twenty technical service teams to go deep into factories, mines, and rural people's communes to spread science and technology.

In supporting industrial and agricultural production, in addition to the Chongqing Metallurgical Design Institute, the Southwest Agricultural College, and the Soil Research Institute focusing on steel plants and rural people's communes, Chongqing University, as a multi-disciplinary comprehensive industrial university, has adopted a complete set of methods, forming a comprehensive technical service team to solve industrial and agricultural production problems in cooperation with various units as needed. In the past two months, they have collaborated with other units to solve more than one hundred key production and major topics in more than forty factories and mines. After going deep into the front line of production, scientific research departments and universities have paid attention to working and researching with workers and technicians before summarizing and promoting. This not only solved problems in production but also improved the technical level of workers, farmers, and technicians. The technical service team of the Chongqing Coal Mine Design Institute went deep into the Nantong Coal Mine and the Guangyuan and Wangcang areas of Sichuan, working alongside workers and engineering technicians down in the mine, producing and studying experiences in increasing coal and coke production. In the past two months, they have successively summarized ten experiences for weak links in mining, excavation, transportation, washing, and refining, such as indigenous transportation machines, indigenous coal crushers, indigenous cranes, and indigenous blasting devices. This has increased coke production by one to three times. In order to help workers and construction technicians improve their technical level, they also held "design disclosure meetings" at the airport to explain the contents of construction drawings, the manufacturing principles of indigenous tools, and operating techniques to various construction design workers. After the Chongqing University Steel Technology Service Team arrived at the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, they spent a month summarizing a "one-stop" comprehensive desulfurization experience with more than ten indigenous and foreign desulfurization measures, turning high-sulfur iron with a high sulfur content into qualified steel; they also held bedside lectures to explain the principles of comprehensive desulfurization to the workers.

In order to help workers and farmers improve production technology, these technical service teams have also vigorously popularized basic production knowledge among workers and farmers. After the teachers and students of Chongqing Iron and Steel Institute arrived at the converter plant of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, they used radio, wall newspapers, and other methods to publicize basic knowledge of converter steelmaking. They also used the workshop furnace side as a classroom, combining theoretical teaching with on-site demonstrations, and explained the principles of converter steelmaking in light of production reality to the workers, which was warmly welcomed by the workers. The agricultural production service team of Southwest Agricultural College trained a large number of junior technical personnel for districts, counties, and communes in Santai County; at the same time, they imparted agricultural production knowledge related to plant protection, seed selection, and seedling cultivation to general commune members.

    把科学技术送到生产第一线
    重庆科学技术人员深入基层总结推广先进经验普及生产知识
    新华社重庆6日电　重庆市科学研究部门和大专学校根据本身特点大力开展技术上门活动，把科学技术送到工、农业生产第一线，积极协助各生产单位解决生产中的关键问题。据不完全统计，今年全市已有三个科学研究单位和十多个大专院校分别组成了二十多个技术服务队深入到工厂、矿山和农村人民公社传播科学技术。
    在支援工农业生产中，除了重庆冶金设计院和西南农学院、土壤研究所等单位分别以钢铁厂和农村人民公社为重点以外，重庆大学是一个多科性的综合工业大学，就采取配套成龙的办法，组成综合技术服务队根据需要和各单位协作解决工农业生产问题。两个多月来，他们和其他单位协作先后到四十多个厂矿解决了一百多个生产关键和重大课题。各科学研究部门和大专学校深入生产第一线后，都注意和工人、技术人员一道工作和研究然后进行总结和推广。不但解决了生产中的问题，还提高了工人、农民和技术人员的技术水平。重庆煤矿设计院的技术服务队深入南桐煤矿和四川广元、旺苍地区，和工人、工程技术人员一道到井下跟班劳动，边生产边研究增产煤焦的经验。两个多月来，他们先后针对采、掘、运、洗、炼等薄弱环节总结出了土运输机、土碎煤机、土起重机、土放炮器等十项经验。使炼焦产量提高了一至三倍。为了帮助工人和施工技术人员提高技术水平，他们还在机场举办了“设计交底会”，向各个施工设计工人讲解施工图的内容，土工具的制作原理和操作技术等。重庆大学的钢铁技术服务团到重庆钢铁公司后，用一个月的时间总结了十几项土洋脱硫措施的“一条龙”综合脱硫经验，把含硫较高的高硫铁炼成了合格钢；还举行了炉边讲座，向工人们讲解了综合脱硫原理。
    为了帮助工人、农民提高生产技术，这些技术服务队还在工人、农民中大力普及生产基础知识。重庆钢铁学院的师生们到重庆钢铁公司转炉厂后，曾经利用广播、墙报等方式宣传转炉炼钢的基本知识。他们并把车间炉旁当课堂，采用理论教学与现场表演相结合的方式，结合生产实际向工人讲解转炉炼钢的原理，受到工人们的热烈欢迎。西南农学院的农业生产服务队在三台县为区、县和公社训练了大批初级技术人材；同时，向一般社员传授了有关植物保护、选种育苗等农业生产知识。（附图片）
