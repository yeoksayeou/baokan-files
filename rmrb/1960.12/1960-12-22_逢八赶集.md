    Market Day Every Eighth Day
    Junliang, Wenxuan, Mingfa
    November 26th (Lunar Calendar, October 8th) is the market day that falls on the eighth day of the month in Wenci City, Shanxi.

    On this day, after the snow, the sky cleared, and the azure sky was boundless. The golden sun shone on the white snow, sparkling with myriad rays of light. Despite the cold weather, the men and women, old and young, around the city, as usual, cheerfully carried baskets, pushed carts, and carried loads on their backs, driving carts, bringing their produced and collected agricultural and sideline products - vegetables, persimmons, red dates, piglets, chickens, ducks, baskets, willow baskets, dustpans, brooms, etc. - continuously converged from all directions to the city market.

    Xi Shuangchen Carries Vegetables to Market
    Along the wide and straight "West Lake" highway, heading south, you reach the bustling West Street entrance – the vegetable market. Here, large and solid cabbages, large red and white radishes, bright red peppers, and fine, long lotus roots are piled up. The people coming to the market are bustling and crowded.

    A broad-shouldered, round-waisted young man with a purplish-red face carried a load of high-quality cabbages to the market. This young man's name is Xi Shuangchen, a member of the Dongguan East Production Team of the Dongguanzhuang Management Area of the Chengguan Commune, a well-known production pacesetter in the whole commune. He loves the Party, loves the collective, believes in the Party's policies, and does whatever the Party tells him to do. Last year, he worked six hundred and fifty-one workdays, and from January to October this year, he has already worked six hundred and eighty days. Today, the cabbages he brought are all produced from his private plot. Like Xi Shuangchen, the private plots and small plots cultivated by all commune members this year are all well-planted, without affecting collective production.

    After Xi Shuangchen sold the cabbages, he went to the means of production department to purchase agricultural tools according to his original plan. Liu Zhongyi, the Party branch secretary of the management area, saw Shuangchen holding a steel mill and a hoe in his hands, and praised him happily: "Shuangchen! You've planned really well; you've already bought the tools for next year." Xi Shuangchen tapped the mill and hoe together and said: "With these two fellows, it will be much easier to work when spring comes next year."

    Li Yongfu Hunts in the Mountains to Earn Money
    In the East Street Native and Animal Products Purchasing Station of the Chengguan Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the purchasing agents are busy receiving commune members carrying various animal skins, wool, medicinal materials, and native products. Suddenly, people's eyes turned to a middle-aged man with a shotgun on his back, thick eyebrows and big eyes, tall stature, and thirteen rabbit skins hanging on the gun barrel.

    "Who is this?" many people asked.

    "It's Li Yongfu from the Xisong Management Area! Don't you know him?" someone replied.

    Li Yongfu is a demobilized soldier with excellent marksmanship. Since the beginning of winter, he has used his spare time to hunt ninety-one various wild animals, including foxes, badgers, and rabbits. He gave the meat to the canteen to improve the lives of the commune members, and sold the skins to the state. The thirteen rabbit skins he brought this time were hunted on the recent snowy day.

    On this day, the native and animal products purchasing station purchased a total of sixty-three kinds of agricultural and sideline products and waste products, such as pig, sheep, and rabbit skins, wool, rope ends, cotton stalk skins, rags, broken shoes, broken covers, medicinal materials, wild oil crops, and watermelon seeds, worth more than one thousand two hundred and ten yuan.

    Director and Secretary Make a Deal
    Wang Chongde, the director of the Wangjiafang Management Area, just came out of the department store when he ran into Zhang Zhigong, the Party branch secretary of the Shangbaitou Management Area. Wang Chongde patted Zhang Zhigong on the shoulder affectionately and said: "Buddy! What did you bring this time?"

    "Hey! Persimmons, dates, and wicker car baskets. What about you?"

    "Cabbages, radishes, garlic, peppers, I guarantee you'll be satisfied." Wang Chongde took a puff of his cigarette and continued: "Let's find a market trader to set the price for us."

    It turned out that the Wangjiafang Management Area is a plain area that produces vegetables, and the Shangbaitou Management Area is a hilly area that produces dried and fresh fruits and woven products. Both have requirements for adjusting surpluses and deficiencies. Since this year, they have traded with each other three times through market trade.

    Wang Chongde and Zhang Zhigong found the market trader Wang Qingbin and explained their purpose. Wang Qingbin introduced the day's listed prices to them while manipulating the abacus with "three times one is three, three times four is twelve," helping them to clear the accounts: the various products of the Shangbaitou Management Area were worth seventy-one yuan and five jiao; the vegetables of the Wangjiafang Management Area were worth one hundred and nineteen yuan and eight jiao, and Shangbaitou paid Wangjiafang forty-eight yuan and three jiao in cash.

    Collective transactions between teams have become a habit in the market. On this day, in addition to Wangjiafang and Shangbaitou, six management areas, including Xinsheng, Beixuezhuang, and Dongguanzhuang, also mutually adjusted surpluses and deficiencies in transactions.

    Small Farm Tools Traded the Most
    In the various shops in the market, people came and went, bustling with activity. However, today, the most popular place, as in previous years, is still the means of production department.

    As early as two days before the market day, the salespeople of the means of production department contacted the management areas and production teams to understand the various means of production and quantities currently needed. They also sent people to key areas to sign sales contracts, make unified arrangements, and classify and queue the tools, preparing to supply them in a planned manner on the market day.

    On the eighth day, the salespeople got up early and arranged the prepared means of production neatly on the shelves, ready to welcome customers. After the business started, in addition to the management areas and production teams paying and picking up goods in batches behind the counter according to the contracts, the commune members outside the counter bought hoes, sickles, mills, and hoes. From 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., when the market was about to end, they roughly calculated that they had sold more than one thousand one hundred hoes, sickles, mills, hoes, rakes, and various machine parts. The Dongguan East Production Team of the Dongguanzhuang Management Area collectively purchased twenty-one hoes, sickles, mills, hoes, and boiler parts at once. Captain Yang Dongsheng said happily: "As long as we have these handy tools, plus the soaring enthusiasm of our commune members, if the land doesn't produce grain, it won't be up to it!"

    Snack Bars Are Very Popular
    There are thirteen snack bars in the market, specializing in soaking steamed buns and heating dry food for the people who come to the market, which is very popular among the masses. Wang Liuhui's snack bar is one of them.

    Military family member Wang Liuhui, an old woman, is not deaf, not blind, and healthy. She has been doing the "Huba馍" business for many years, and her spirit of serving the commune members is very good. Every market day, she always gets up early, prepares the vegetables, seasonings, fuel, etc. properly, lights the stove, and waits for the people who come to the market to soak steamed buns and heat dry food.

    It was very cold on the eighth day. Ji Ronghua, an old man from the Wangjiafang Production Team, came over with two frozen steamed buns. Wang Liuhui warmly greeted him to sit down and skillfully cut the buns, cut the vegetables, and kept asking questions: "Do you want chili peppers?"

    "Give me more; pour some vinegar too, to warm my belly with a sour and spicy taste."

    "Okay! Whatever your taste is."

    Before long, two bowls of steaming steamed buns were served to Ji Ronghua's hands.

    Ji Ronghua ate heartily and said to everyone he met: "Oh, the steamed buns are different from the past now. The buns are cut thinly, soaked softly, hot and fragrant, and taken care of like family."

                × × ×
    As the sun sets in the west, the market ends. Because it just snowed, there are fewer people coming to the market than usual, but it still reaches more than twelve thousand people. In addition to Chengguan Commune, many commune members from five communes within a thirty-mile radius, including Xiading, Beiyuan, Dongzhen, Hedi, and Huzhang, also came to participate. The total turnover on this day reached twenty-eight thousand four hundred and sixty-three yuan, of which farmer trade reached four thousand two hundred and sixty-one yuan.

    逢八赶集
    俊良　文轩　明发
    11月26日（旧历十月初八），是山西闻喜城关的逢八集日。
    这一天，雪过天晴，碧空万里，金黄色的太阳照在皑皑的白雪上，闪耀着万道光彩。尽管天气寒冷，但城关周围的男女老少，却仍和往常一样，兴高彩烈地提篮挑筐，推车背篓，赶着大车，带着他们生产的和采集的农副土特产品——蔬菜、柿子、红枣、猪娃、鸡、鸭和筐子、柳篮、簸箕、扫帚等，从四面八方络绎不断地汇集到城关集市上来。
    席双臣担菜上市
    沿着宽敞笔直的“西湖”公路，一直往南，就到了热闹的西街口——蔬菜市场。这里，个大心实的白菜，肥大的红、白萝卜，红艳艳的辣椒，丝长质细的莲菜，一堆一堆。赶集上市的人们，熙熙攘攘。
    一个膀宽腰圆，紫红色脸皮的小伙子，担着一担上等好白菜来到了市场。这个小伙子叫席双臣，是城关公社东官庄管理区东官东生产队的社员，全社闻名的生产标兵，他热爱党，热爱集体，相信党的政策，党说干啥他干啥。去年，他做了六百五十一个劳动日，今年1至10月份已做了六百八十个。今天，他担来的白菜，都是自留地生产的。全社社员们今年种植的自留地和小块地，和席双臣一样，在不影响集体生产的前提下，都种得很好。
    席双臣卖了白菜，就按照原来的计划，到生产资料门市部购置农具。管理区党支部书记刘忠义见双臣手里拿着一张钢铣和一把钁头，高兴地夸奖他：“双臣！你打算的真周到，明年用的工具现在就置好了。”席双臣把铣、钁往一起一碰说：“有了这两个家伙，明年一开春，干起活来就利洒多了。”
    李永福打山卖钱
    在城关供销总店东街土畜产品收购站，收购员们正忙着接待带着各种兽皮、羊毛、药材以及土特产品的社员们。突然，人们的视线都转向一个背着土枪、粗眉大眼、身材高大、枪杆上挑着十三张兔皮的中年人。
    “这是谁？”不少人在问。
    “西宋管理区的李永福嘛！你还不知道？”一个人答道。
    李永福是个复员军人，枪法很好。入冬以来，他利用空闲时间，已经打了狐、獾、兔等各种野兽九十一只。他把肉交给食堂，让社员们改善了生活，皮张卖给了国家。这次拿来的十三张兔皮，就是他在最近下雪天打下的。
    这一天，土畜产品收购站，总共收购了猪、羊、兔皮、羊毛、绳头、棉秆皮、破布、烂鞋、烂套子、药材、野生油料、西瓜籽等六十三种农副土特产品和废品，价值一千二百一十多元。
    主任和支书成交
    王家房管理区主任王崇德刚从百货大楼里出来，就碰上了上白土管理区党支部书记张志恭，王崇德拍着张志恭的肩膀亲切地说：“伙计！你这次来，带了些什么？”
    “咳！柿子、枣儿，还有荆条编的车筐子。你呢？”
    “白菜、萝卜、大蒜、辣椒，保险你满意。”王崇德吸了一口烟接着说：“咱们找市场交易员给咱定定价钱。”
    原来，王家房管理区是出产蔬菜的平川区，上白土管理区是出产干、鲜水果和编织品的丘陵区。都有调剂有无的要求。今年以来，通过集市贸易，他们已经相互成交三次了。
    王崇德和张志恭找见了市场交易员王清宾，说明了来由，王清宾一边给他俩介绍当天的牌价，一边就“三得三，三四一十二”地拨弄着算盘，帮他俩算清了账：上白土管理区的各种产品，价值七十一元五角；王家房管理区的蔬菜值一百一十九元八角，上白土又找了王家房现款四十八元三角。
    集市上，队与队集体成交已成了习惯。这一天除王家房和上白土以外，互相调剂有无成交的还有新生、北薛庄、东官庄等六个管理区。
    小农具交易最多
    集市上的各个商店里，你来他往，热闹异常。可是，今天最红火的地方，和往年一样，还是生产资料门市部。
    早在集日的前两天，生产资料门市部的营业员们，就一面和各管理区、生产队联系，了解当前需要的各种生产资料和数量，一面派人到重点区签订售货合同，统一安排，并且进行了工具分类排队，准备集日有计划地供应。
    初八这天，营业员们一早起来，就把准备的各种生产资料整整齐齐地分别摆在货架上，迎接顾客们的到来。营业开始以后，除了各管理区和生产队在柜台后面按照合同成批地交款取货以外，柜台外面的社员们，这个买张锄、镰，那个买把铣、镢。从上午十一点开始到下午三点集市快要结束的时候，他们粗略地计算了一下，已经出售了锄、镰、铣、镢、耙子和各种机器零件一千一百余件。只东官庄管理区东官东生产队一下就集体购买了锄、镰、铣、镢和锅驼机零件达二十一件。队长杨东生高兴地说：“只要有了这些得心应手的工具，加上咱社员的冲天干劲，地里不打粮食不由它！”
    小吃部颇受欢迎
    市场上有十三家小吃部，专为赶集的人们泡馍热干粮，很受群众欢迎。王刘号老大娘的小吃部就是其中的一个。
    军属王刘号老大娘，耳不聋、眼不花，身体健壮，干“糊拔馍”这个买卖已经好多年了，她为社员服务的精神很好。每逢集日，她总是早早起来，把蔬菜、调料、燃料等备办的妥妥贴贴，把炉火点好，等候赶集的人们泡馍热干粮。
    初八这一天很冷，王家房生产队的吉荣华老汉拿着两个冻得硬梆梆的蒸馍过来了，王刘号老大娘一边热情地招呼他坐下，一边熟练地切馍，切菜，不断的问长问短：“放辣椒不？”
    “给咱多上点；再倒点醋，酸辣辣地暖暖肚子。”
    “行！随你的口味。”
    不大一会，两碗热气腾腾的泡馍就端到吉荣华老汉的手里。
    吉荣华老汉美美地吃了一顿，见人就说：“唉呀，如今泡馍的也和过去不一样了，馍切得薄薄的，泡得软软的，又热又香，照顾得真和一家人一样。”
                ×　×　×
    夕阳西下，集市结束了，因为刚下了雪，赶集的人比往常少，但也达到一万二千多人。除城关公社以外，方圆三十里以内的下丁、北垣、东镇、河底、胡张等五个公社的不少社员也赶来参加了，这一天成交总额达到二万八千四百六十三元，其中农民贸易达四千二百六十一元。
