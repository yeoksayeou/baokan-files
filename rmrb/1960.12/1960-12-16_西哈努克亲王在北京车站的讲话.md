Mr. President of the Republic, Mr. Premier of the State Council, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, Dearest Friends:

    Please allow me to express our heartfelt thanks to President Liu Shaoqi for his friendly and cordial speech to Cambodia and our people. At the same time, please allow me to express our deep gratitude to the People's Republic of China, to her outstanding leaders, and to her great people for once again extending us this cordial invitation. Thanks to this invitation, we are here today with joy and honor.

    Our visit is an exchange between very close relatives, and our feelings for each other are consistent. A few months ago, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Marshal Chen Yi paid a visit to Cambodia. This visit movingly demonstrated the unity between our two countries. Today, our visit once again demonstrates our unity and solid friendship.

    The great country of New China is a beacon in Asia. She is an admirable example to all Asian and African countries and provides invaluable support to all peoples fighting to maintain their independence.

    New China, thanks to the wisdom of her leaders, the courage of her people, and her peaceful and progressive will, has spread her reputation throughout the world. She now plays a decisive role in the evolution of the world and will increasingly play a decisive role.

    Through personal experience, Cambodia recognizes the sincerity and selflessness of China's relationship with countries like ours, who are resolutely peace-loving, resolutely respectful of rights and justice, and resolutely engaged in better understanding between all peoples.

    We have consistently advocated for the recognition of New China's role in the evolution of the world, because ignoring the Chinese people's contribution to progress and peace is futile and absurd.

    I should salute China, because without her example and help, we certainly would not have achieved what we have today. The enthusiasm shown by the Chinese experts and technicians who work like brothers with our people in many fields is something we are heartily thankful for. The various methods we have learned from China are very well adapted to our economic conditions and are a key factor in our national construction efforts.

    Cambodian-Chinese cooperation has blossomed and borne fruit. I believe that this cooperation will continue to develop in many areas and will contribute to the acquisition of complete independence and prosperity in Asia, which is difficult to imagine today.

    In a few days, we will sign a treaty of friendship and non-aggression with the Chinese government, which will emphatically demonstrate to the whole world our close and solid relationship of unity, as well as our commitment to the ideals and determination of the Bandung spirit.

    At the same time, I would also like to tell you how happy we are to have the opportunity to appreciate the new and tremendous achievements that the Chinese people have made since our visit to your country in 1958. All of our people admire and watch with amazement the extraordinary progress of the Chinese people, and like brothers, we cheer for your every new achievement.

    Finally, please allow me to express to you how happy we are to be back in your capital, which has become more beautiful, to see again the friendly people of your country, and the outstanding leaders of China, especially Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi, whose constant support is our most treasured comfort.

    With firm faith in the future of our two countries, I shout:

    Long live the People's Republic of China!

    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the founder of New China!

    Long live Chairman Liu Shaoqi!

    Long live Premier Zhou Enlai!

    Glory belongs to the indestructible fraternal friendship between Cambodia and China!

    西哈努克亲王在北京车站的讲话共和国主席先生，国务院总理先生，阁下们，女士们，先生们，最亲爱的朋友们：
    请允许我向刘少奇主席先生表示我们衷心的谢意，感谢他对柬埔寨和我国人民发表了如此友好和亲切的讲话。同时，请允许我向中华人民共和国、向她的杰出的领导人、向她的伟大的人民表示我们的深切的感激，感谢他们又一次亲切地邀请我们。由于这一邀请，我们今天愉快地和荣幸地来到了这里。
    我们的访问是非常亲密的亲戚间的交往，我们彼此的感情是始终如一的。几个月以前，周恩来总理和陈毅副总理元帅光临柬埔寨访问。这一访问动人地表现出了我们两国之间的团结。今天我们的访问又一次地表现了我们之间的团结和巩固的友谊。
    新中国这个伟大的国家是亚洲的灯塔，她是所有亚非国家的令人钦佩的榜样，并且给与所有为维护独立而斗争的各国人民以十分珍贵的支持。
    新中国，由于她的领导人的英明，她的人民的勇敢以及她的和平的和进步的意志，已经声誉传遍世界，她现在在世界的演进中起着决定性的作用，并且将日益起决定性的作用。
    由于亲身的体验，柬埔寨认识到中国同像我们这样坚决爱好和平、坚决尊重权利和正义、坚决从事于各国人民之间更好谅解的一些国家的关系中所具有的真诚和无私。
    我们一向不懈地主张承认新中国在世界演进中所起的作用，因为无视中国人民对进步和和平所做出的贡献，是徒劳的和荒谬的。
    我应该向中国致意，因为没有她的榜样和帮助，我们肯定不会获得像今天这样的成就。和我国人民一起兄弟般地在许多方面进行工作的中国专家和技术人员所表现的积极性，是我们衷心感激的。我们从中国吸取的各种方法都非常好地适用于我们的经济条件，并且在我们努力从事的国家建设中是一个首要的因素。
    柬中合作已经开花结果。我相信，这种合作将在许多方面继续发展，并且将为亚洲获取今天难于想像的彻底独立和繁荣做出贡献。
    再过几天，我们将和中国政府签订一项友好互不侵犯条约，这样将在全世界面前，着重表明我们之间的紧密的和巩固的团结关系，以及我们致力于万隆精神的理想和决心。
    同时，我也愿意告诉你们，我们是多么地高兴，有机会来赞赏中国人民自我1958年访问贵国以来所获得的新的巨大的成就。我们全体人民都钦佩地注视着中国人民的异乎寻常的迈步前进，并且像兄弟一般地欢呼你们的每一个新的成就。
    最后，请允许我向你们表示，当我重新来到你们的变得更美丽的首都，重新看到贵国如此友好的人民以及中国的杰出领导人，特别是周恩来总理和陈毅副总理时，我们是感到非常高兴的，周恩来总理和陈毅副总理的一贯的支持是我们最珍贵的安慰。
    我怀着对我们两国的前途的坚定信念高呼：
    中华人民共和国万岁，
    新中国的奠基人毛泽东主席万岁，
    刘少奇主席万岁，
    周恩来总理万岁，
    光荣属于柬埔寨和中国间的不可摧毁的兄弟般的友谊！
