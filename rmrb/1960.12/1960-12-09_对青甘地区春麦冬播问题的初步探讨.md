    Preliminary Discussion on Winter Sowing of Spring Wheat in Qinghai-Gansu Area
    Soil and Agricultural Division, Comprehensive Scientific Expedition to Qinghai and Gansu, Chinese Academy of Sciences
    In recent years, winter sowing of spring wheat has been practiced in Haibei and Qaidam areas of Qinghai Province and Hexi area of Gansu Province (collectively referred to as Qinghai-Gansu area). This is of great practical and theoretical significance to agricultural production in alpine regions. In the past two years, we have conducted some preliminary investigations, studies, and experimental analyses in this regard. Now we would like to briefly describe our superficial understanding of this issue as follows.
      The Superiority of Winter Sowing of Spring Wheat
    Winter sowing of spring wheat has many advantages. First of all, agriculture in the Qinghai-Gansu area is a single-cropping system per year, and spring wheat has always been sown in spring. Due to the large planting area of spring wheat, water use is concentrated in the spring, which is an abnormally dry season in this area, and the arrangement of labor, machinery, etc., is relatively tight. Winter sowing of spring wheat can be carried out at any time throughout the winter, regardless of time and soil moisture, depending on the availability of labor and machinery.
    Secondly, winter sowing of spring wheat can advance maturity and increase yield. According to experiments and large-scale surveys in various places over the past few years, winter sowing of spring wheat generally shows a more obvious effect of advancing maturity. Advancing maturity is of great significance for increasing wheat production in alpine regions. At the same time, it also means that the planting range of spring wheat can be expanded, breaking through the existing planting altitude of spring wheat in Qaidam and Haibei areas—3,200 meters above sea level—and planting at 3,400 meters or higher, thereby changing the crop distribution on the plateau. In the Hexi area, which is 1,400 to 2,200 meters above sea level, advancing maturity also provides the possibility of increasing the multiple cropping index and improving land utilization.
    Winter-sown wheat (hereinafter referred to as winter-sown wheat) has a significant increase in yield compared with normally sown spring wheat (hereinafter referred to as spring-sown wheat). The general increase in yield is about 13.13% to 57.89%. For example, the experimental results of Delingha Farm in Qaidam Basin in 1958 showed that winter-sown wheat increased yield by 28.2% to 34.7% compared with spring-sown wheat; in the large-scale production of Xiangride Farm in 1960, the average yield of winter-sown wheat per mu was more than 15% higher than that of spring-sown wheat.
    Third, increase resistance to adverse environments. Compared with spring-sown wheat, winter-sown wheat also has higher resistance or adaptability in resisting adverse environmental conditions.
    Spring in the Qinghai-Gansu area is a dry and water-deficient season. When water shortage is relatively serious, it is also the time when spring-sown wheat is just entering the three-leaf stage and tillering stage. At this time, the plants are small and the roots are shallow; and the field coverage is small and the evaporation is large. Therefore, the growth and development of seedlings are greatly threatened. Winter-sown wheat, on the other hand, has entered the peak tillering stage or jointing stage at this time. The root system is deeper and can absorb deeper soil moisture; at the same time, the field surface coverage is also larger, which reduces evaporation, thereby increasing its resistance to spring drought, and the seedlings will not be seriously affected by spring drought.
    Spring drought often causes soil salinization. Spring-sown wheat in the three-leaf stage is easily poisoned by excessive salt content; winter-sown wheat, on the other hand, has deeper roots, accumulates more substances in the body, and has a higher concentration of cell sap, which can absorb water from deeper soil layers and avoid salt damage. According to observations and measurements in the Qaidam Basin, winter-sown wheat seedlings can still grow normally in soil with a salt content of 0.6163%; while spring-sown wheat will be harmed in soil with a salt content exceeding 0.519%.
    In addition, according to our observations, winter-sown wheat that has undergone low-temperature training in winter and early spring also has higher cold resistance in the seedling stage than spring-sown wheat. At the same time, due to being in low-temperature conditions for a relatively long time, the internodes of the stem are more compact during elongation, which makes the stems thicker, the stem walls thicker, and the internodes shorter, and the lodging resistance is also improved. According to measurements at Xiangride Farm in Qaidam, the lodging index of winter-sown wheat is 1.13-2.82 lower than that of spring-sown wheat. In terms of disease resistance, according to measurements, the mortality rate of winter-sown wheat after being infected with "Qingsi" disease, which is the most serious disease affecting wheat locally, is also 3.04% lower than that of spring-sown wheat.
    Preliminary Analysis of the Reasons for Early Maturity and High Yield of Winter-Sown Wheat
    After spring wheat is sown in winter, with the changes in external conditions, corresponding changes also occur in its internal physiology, thereby forming early maturity and high yield. Based on experimental data, a preliminary analysis of the reasons for early maturity and high yield is as follows.
    1. Earlier growth period. When the frozen soil begins to thaw in early spring, winter-sown wheat seeds can begin to absorb water and germinate and emerge. Each different growth period is earlier than that of spring-sown wheat. For example, the beginning of seed germination is 30 to 35 days earlier than that of spring-sown wheat, the emergence period is 20 to 25 days earlier, the tillering period is 12 to 15 days earlier, the jointing period is 7 to 8 days earlier, the heading period is 6 to 7 days earlier, the grain-filling period is about 7 to 8 days earlier, and the end of the grain-filling period is also about 7 to 10 days earlier.
    The seedling stage of winter-sown wheat is in low-temperature conditions for a long time. Therefore, although germination, emergence, and tillering begin earlier than those of spring-sown wheat, the time required to pass through each of these stages is relatively longer than that of spring-sown wheat due to temperature limitations. This is extremely beneficial to the strong tillering ability, high ear-forming rate, many grains, and large ears of winter-sown wheat. Because the earlier the tillering period, the higher the ear-forming rate of tillers; the longer the tillering period, the stronger the tillering ability of a single plant. Therefore, in general, the tillering rate of winter-sown wheat is higher than that of spring-sown wheat.
    The increase in effective tillering means that the ratio of tiller ears to the total ears is increased, which has a certain significance for making up for insufficient planting density. For example, at Xiangride Farm, winter-sown wheat with 476,000 seedlings planted per mu had 615,000 ears; while spring-sown wheat with 488,000 seedlings planted had only 544,000 ears per mu. At the same time, in some alpine mountainous areas, the early low temperature inhibits the development of the main stem, making the difference between tillers and the main stem not significant, and the economic traits of tiller ears also catch up with the traits of the main stem ears. Therefore, tiller ears in these areas play an important role in the composition of yield.
    2. Large ears and many grains. Studies on stage development indicate that in order for spring wheat to successfully pass through the photoperiod stage, it must have sufficient sunshine hours (more than 12 hours), a certain light quality, light intensity, suitable temperature (above 10 degrees Celsius), and comprehensive conditions such as water and nutrients. Water and nutrients are determined by cultivation techniques; while factors such as sunshine hours and temperature currently depend on the natural conditions of each region. Although the Qinghai-Gansu area has reached more than 12 hours of sunshine per day by the end of March and the beginning of April, which meets the needs of spring wheat passing through the photoperiod stage, the temperature is still low, still below 10 degrees Celsius, which does not meet the needs of spring wheat. Therefore, on the whole, the photoperiod stage of winter-sown wheat is passed through at a relatively low temperature and for a relatively long time.
    Previous studies have shown that the photoperiod stage is the period when wheat young ears differentiate and form. Extending the time of the photoperiod stage will inevitably increase the number of spikelets and spikelet flower primordia differentiated in the wheat ears, thereby creating conditions for large ears and many grains. Winter-sown wheat promotes the development and differentiation of wheat ears towards large ears and many grains by passing through the photoperiod stage for a longer time.
    3. Full grain and improved quality. Winter-sown wheat not only has large ears and many grains, but also has a stronger growth potential than spring-sown wheat, with well-developed assimilation organs and a long vegetative period. Therefore, it has sufficient material accumulation, producing large and full grains.
    According to observations, the green organs of winter-sown wheat have a growth period of 140 to 150 days from emergence to maturity, which is 20 to 25 days longer than that of spring-sown wheat; the chlorophyll content of its flag leaves is about 0.47% higher than that of spring-sown wheat; and the succulence of leaves is also increased by 0.4 grams per 100 square centimeters; the lifespan of the same order of leaves is also 12 to 16 days longer. It is precisely because the lifespan of the leaves is prolonged and the assimilative life function is improved that it is conducive to the accumulation of materials. According to measurements, the dry matter weight of 100 winter-sown wheat plants is 13 grams higher than that of spring-sown wheat, and the 1,000-grain weight of seeds is generally increased by about 2.49 grams.
    At the same time, the dry winds that often appear in the upper and middle ten days of August and the early fogs that appear in the middle and lower ten days of August in the Qinghai area, as well as the hot easterly winds in the middle and lower ten days of July in the Hexi area, seriously affect wheat grain filling. Because the grain-filling period of winter-sown wheat is advanced, it can avoid being affected. Carrying out grain filling for a longer time under good conditions can transport the nutrients accumulated in the plant more fully to the grains and improve the quality of wheat. The masses also report that winter-sown wheat has a high flour yield and good gluten.
      Technical Measures for Winter Sowing of Spring Wheat
    1. Create a soil environment suitable for winter sowing. Winter sowing of spring wheat requires that the seeds can overwinter normally in the soil, absorb water and germinate preferentially in early spring of the following year, and also requires that the surface layer of the soil does not freeze, which is convenient for smooth winter sowing. To this end, the soil conditions of moist subsoil and dry topsoil should be created before winter sowing.
    2. Master the appropriate sowing time and sowing depth. If sowing is too early, when the temperature temporarily rises, the subsoil will melt, causing the seeds to absorb water and germinate, and then when the temperature drops, the seeds will be damaged by freezing. Light damage will reduce vitality, and severe damage will prevent emergence. Our experiments at Xiangride Farm showed that all those sown in early December were damaged to varying degrees during overwintering because the temperature at noon at that time could still reach above 2 degrees Celsius, causing the seeds to absorb water and germinate. The emergence rate of those sown when the temperature was stable below 0 degrees Celsius reached more than 98%.
    According to investigations in various places, the suitable period for winter sowing of spring wheat in the Qinghai-Gansu area is when the average daily ground temperature is stable at around 0 to 2 degrees Celsius and the bottom soil no longer thaws, until the soil thaws in the spring of the following year. This period in the Qaidam Basin is generally from the beginning of December to the middle and lower ten days of February of the following year, about 75 to 85 days; in Haibei, Qinghai, it is generally from the lower ten days of November to the end of February of the following year, about 90 days. In the Hexi Corridor of Gansu, according to meteorological data, the sowing period may be delayed somewhat compared to the above two regions.
    According to data from various places, the sowing depth should be 4 to 6 cm. The germination rate of Xiangride Farm's sowing depth test at 5.12 cm reached 97.7%.
    3. Rake and loosen the soil and break up the crust in early spring. After winter and spring snowfall, efforts should be organized in a timely manner to disperse excessive snow accumulation in low-lying areas; in early spring, raking and loosening the soil should also be carried out in a timely manner to break up the crust and increase the emergence rate.
    As long as these technical measures that have been proven effective in practice are conscientiously implemented, the effects of early maturity and high yield of winter sowing of spring wheat will definitely be achieved, and the relatively serious seedling deficiency phenomenon that currently exists in production will definitely be overcome.

    对青甘地区春麦冬播问题的初步探讨
    中国科学院青甘综合考察队土壤农业分队
    近几年来，在青海的海北、柴达木地区和甘肃的河西一带（合称青甘地区）实行春小麦冬季播种。这在高寒地区农业生产上具有重大的实践意义和理论意义。两年来，我们曾在这一方面进行了一些初步的调查研究和试验分析。现将我们对这一问题的肤浅认识，略述于后。
      春小麦冬播的优越性
    春小麦冬播有很多好处。首先，青甘地区的农业是一年一熟制，春小麦历年都是春耕春种。由于春小麦播种面积较大，使得春季异常干燥的地区在用水上呈现集中的情况，也使劳力、机具等的安排比较紧张。春麦冬播可以在整个冬季里不受时间、墒情的限制，随时根据劳力、机具情况进行。
    其次，春小麦冬播可以提前成熟，增加产量。据几年来各地的试验和大面积调查，春麦冬播后，一般都表现了比较明显的提前成熟的效果。提前成熟，对于高寒地区的小麦增产具有重要意义。同时它还意味着可以扩大春小麦的种植范围，突破柴达木和海北地区现有春小麦的种植高度——拔海三千二百米，而在三千四百米或更高的高度种植，从而改变高原的作物分布。在河西拔海一千四百到二千二百米的地区，提前成熟，还为增加复种指数，提高土地利用率提供了可能性。
    春麦冬播（以下简称冬播麦）较之正常播种的春小麦（以下简称春播麦），产量有明显的增加。一般的增产幅度约在13.13％—57.89％之间。例如，柴达木盆地德令哈农场1958年的试验结果，冬播麦比春播麦增产28.2％—34.7％；香日德农场1960年大面积生产，平均亩产冬播麦要比春播麦增加15％以上。
    第三、增加对不良环境的抵抗能力。与春播麦相较，冬播麦在抵抗不良环境条件方面也具有较高的抵抗性或适应性。
    青甘地区的春季，是一个干旱、缺水的季节。在缺水比较严重的时候，也是春播麦正好进入三叶期、分蘖期。这时植株小，扎根浅；而田间复盖度小，蒸发量大，因此，幼苗的生长发育受到极大的威胁。冬播麦这时却已进入分蘖盛期或拔节期，根系入土较深，能够吸收较深层的水分；同时田面复盖度也较大，减低了蒸发，从而增加了对春旱的耐变能力，幼苗不致因春旱受到严重影响。
    春季的干旱，还常常引起土壤返盐。三叶期的春播麦，极易因盐分过大的影响而遭受毒害；冬播麦则因根较深，体内积累的物质较多，细胞液的浓度较大，可以从较深的土层吸水，而避免盐分的危害。据在柴达木盆地观察测定，冬播麦苗期在含盐量0.6163％的土壤上，仍能正常生长；而春播麦在含盐量超过0.519％的土壤上，就会受到危害。
    此外，据我们观察，经受过冬季和早春低温锻炼的冬播麦，在苗期的抗寒力上也比春播麦为高。同时，由于比较长期处于低温条件下，茎部节间伸长时比较紧凑，从而使茎秆粗壮、秆壁增厚，节间缩短，抗倒伏的能力，也有所提高。据在柴达木香日德农场测定，冬播麦的倒伏指数要比春播麦的低1.13—2.82。在抗病方面，据测定，对当地危害小麦最严重的青死病，冬播麦染病后的死亡率也比春播麦低3.04％。
    冬播麦早熟高产原因的初步分析
    春小麦在冬季播种以后，随着外界条件的改变，内部生理上也相应地起了一些变化，从而形成了早熟高产。现根据试验资料，对早熟高产的原因作如下的初步分析。
    一、生育时期提前。当早春冻土初融的时候，冬播麦种子便可以开始吸水萌动和出苗，各个不同生育时期都比春播麦提前。例如，种子开始萌动要比春播麦提前三十至三十五天，出苗期提前二十至二十五天、分蘖期提前十二至十五天、拔节期提前七至八天、抽穗期提前六至七天、灌浆期约提前七至八天，灌浆停止时期也约提早七至十天。
    冬播麦的幼苗期处于低温条件下的时间较长，因此尽管萌动、出苗、分蘖等比春播麦开始得要早，但由于温度的限制，通过这每一个时期所需的时间，却相对地比春播麦要长。这一点对于冬播麦的分蘖力强、成穗率高、粒多、穗大是极为有利的。因为分蘖期愈早，分蘖株的成穗率愈高；分蘖时期愈长，单株的分蘖能力也就愈强。因此，一般情况下，冬播麦的分蘖率要比春播麦高。
    有效分蘖的增加，就是分蘖株成穗的比率提高，这对弥补种植密度不足，有着一定的意义。例如在香日德农场，每亩播种四十七点六万苗的冬播麦，成穗达六十一点五万；而播种四十八点八万苗的春播麦，成穗仅达每亩五十四点四万。同时，在某些高寒的山区，早期的低温抑制着主茎的发育，使分蘖株与主茎的差别不大，分蘖穗的经济性状也赶上主茎穗的性状。因此，这些地区的分蘖穗在产量构成上有着重要的作用。
    二、穗子大，结粒多。有关阶段发育的研究指出，要使春小麦顺利通过光照阶段，必须具备足够的光照时数（十二小时以上）、一定的光质、光照强度、适宜的温度（摄氏十度以上），以及水分、养分等综合的条件。水分、养分决定于栽培技术；而光照时数和温度等因素，目前则取决于各个地区的自然条件。青甘地区，虽然在3月底、4月初的日照时数就已达到每天十二小时以上，符合春小麦通过光照阶段时的需要，但温度较低，仍在摄氏十度以下，不符合春小麦的需要，因此，整个说来，冬播麦的光照阶段，是在比较低的温度条件下，以比较长的时间通过的。
    以往的研究证明，光照阶段是小麦幼穗分化形成的时期，光照阶段时间的延长，就必然会使小麦穗部分化出的小穗和小穗花原基的数目增多，从而为穗大、粒多创造条件。冬播麦以较长的时间通过光照阶段，促进了小麦穗部向穗大、粒多方面发育和分化。
    三、结实饱满，品质改善。冬播麦不仅穗大粒多，而且由于其生长势比春播麦旺，同化器官发育良好，植株的营养期也长，所以有充分的物质积累，产生大而饱满的籽粒。
    据观察，冬播麦由出苗至成熟期间，绿色器官生长期有一百四十至一百五十天，比春播的要长二十至二十五天；其箭叶叶绿素的含量，约比春播的增加0.47％左右；叶片肉质度每一百平方厘米也增高零点四克；同序叶片的寿命也要长十二至十六天。正因为叶片的寿命延长，同化的生活功能提高，因此有利于物质的积累。据测定，冬播麦每百株干物质的重量，要比春播麦增加十三克，种子的千粒重也一般提高二点四九克左右。
    同时，青海地区8月上、中旬经常出现的旱风和8月中、下旬出现的早雾，以及河西地区7月中、下旬的热东风等，严重影响了小麦灌浆，而冬播麦由于灌浆时期的提早就可以不受影响。在良好的条件下进行较长时间的灌浆，就可以把植株所积累的营养物质，更充分地运输到籽粒中去，改善小麦的品质。广大群众也反映冬播麦的出粉率高、面筋好。
      春麦冬播的技术措施
    一、创造适宜于冬播的土壤环境。春麦冬播，要求种子在土壤中既能正常越冬，又要能在次年早春优先吸水萌发，还要求土壤表层不冻结，便于冬季顺利播种。为此，应当在冬播前，创造出底土湿润、表土干燥的土壤条件。
    二、掌握适宜的播种时期和播种深度。如果播种过早，温度暂时升高时，底土融解，将使种子吸水萌动，而后当温度降低时，便使种子受到冻害，轻者降低生活能力，重者不能出苗。我们在香日德农场的试验表明，凡在12月上旬播种的，由于当时中午的温度还可达到摄氏二度以上，使种子吸水萌动，越冬时都程度不同地受到了损害。在温度稳定在摄氏零度以下时播种的，出苗率达到了98％以上。
    根据各地的调查，青甘地区的春麦冬播的适宜时期，是在播深土层范围内，自日平均地温稳定在摄氏零度至二度左右、底层土壤不再解冻时开始，直到次年春天土壤解冻以前为止。这一时期在柴达木盆地，一般为12月初到翌年2月中、下旬，约有七十五至八十五天；青海海北一般为11月下旬至翌年2月底，约有九十天左右。而在甘肃河西走廊，根据气象资料，播期可能要比上两地区推迟一些。
    根据各地资料，播种深度以四至六厘米为宜。香日德农场的播深试验结果，五点一二厘米的发芽率达到了97.7％。
    三、早春即时耙地松土，破除板结。冬春降雪以后，应当及时组织力量，分散低处过多的积雪；早春还应及时进行耙地松土的工作，以破除板结，增进出苗率。
    只要认真地执行这些实践中已经行之有效的技术措施，春麦冬播的早熟、高产的效果，一定能够实现，而当前生产中存在的比较严重的缺苗现象，也一定能够克服。
