Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 25th: The full text of Prince Sihanouk's speech at the farewell banquet for him is as follows: Marshal, Governor, Ladies and Gentlemen:

    Please allow me to express my deep gratitude to the Governor of Guangdong Province for the warm, friendly, and kind words he has spoken about our delegation and the entire Cambodian people.

    It is with pleasure and excitement that I have come to Guangzhou once again, a city that has become dear to our hearts and that has always extended to us a sincere and fraternal welcome.

    I am deeply moved by the kind and sincere words that Marshal Chen Yi has just spoken about our country and the Cambodian people. These words express, with pure and inspiring emotion, the friendship that binds our two countries together. Please allow me to take this opportunity to recall the role that Marshal Chen Yi has played in the development of Sino-Cambodian friendship.

    For his Chinese brothers, the Marshal is simultaneously a great soldier of the people, a respected diplomat, an active warrior, and a poet. For the Cambodian people, he is and will always be our ardent and faithful friend, who once aided our threatened nation with his understanding and unreserved support. We will never forget that when foreign troops occupied one of our provinces, when a certain foreign government even dared to lay territorial claim to our coastal islands, Marshal Chen Yi unequivocally expressed the warning of 650 million Chinese people in admirably clear language. The position taken by China gave our people greater confidence and, at the same time, gave those who threatened us and did not sincerely uphold the Bandung Principles a salutary caution.

    Two years ago, Marshal Chen Yi also accompanied us to Guangzhou, expressing his respect for our country. Today, as two years ago, we are again honored to be here, but we are particularly pleased by the presence of Mrs. Chen Yi. In 1959, Mrs. Chen Yi visited Cambodia as an admirable and respected envoy of New China.

    It is a great honor and pleasure for all Cambodians to be able to award Marshal Chen Yi the highest honor of our country. Marshal Chen Yi accepts this medal in the name of the Chinese people and the Chinese government, and he becomes one of the noblest figures in Cambodia and a very precious bridge linking China and Cambodia.

    We are about to conclude an unforgettable visit to China, which Cambodia and the entire Khmer people regard as brothers. In Beijing, we received the highest honors. Whether it was from Jining to Beijing, or from Beijing to Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Guangzhou, we could feel a completely spontaneous friendship and unity. This friendship and unity, for the benefit of the people of both countries, for the future of peace, and for the construction of our Asian continent, is constantly being promoted and developed.

    But this visit also allowed us to see the grand scale on which People's China is developing, and to admire the genius with which the Chinese people, under the leadership of the socialist regime, are developing their country on the road to progress at an increasingly rapid pace. In your admirable new achievements, we have drawn new and valuable experience for our own national construction. The significant material and technical assistance that China has given us once again, as well as the outstanding example set by your people, allows us to look to the future with confidence.

    Furthermore, we held meetings and talks with outstanding Chinese leaders, with Chairman Mao Zedong, who is full of wisdom and foresight, with Chairman Liu Shaoqi, who is so understanding towards us, with Premier Zhou Enlai and Marshal Chen Yi, who are admired for their perseverance, sincerity, and love of peace and justice, with all members of the Chinese government, and with high-ranking Chinese authorities. In these talks, we exchanged views on major international issues of concern to all mankind. We noted with particular pleasure that China and Cambodia have very close positions, and that our actions and our goals are consistent on all issues related to defending peace, justice, and freedom, and the right of all peoples to demand independence and progress.

    It is precisely in the name of this justice that we have demanded, and will continue to demand, the recognition of the right of the People's Republic of China to participate in all international conferences, especially as the sole and true representative of the Chinese people in the United Nations. It is also precisely in the name of this justice that we sincerely hope that all territories internationally recognized as belonging to China will be promptly returned to the People's Republic of China.

    New China occupies a leading position in the world because of her courage, drive, and desire for peace and progress. All non-aligned small and medium-sized countries unanimously recognize this position of New China, a position that no one can deprive, or even deny. Obviously, we Cambodians are excited to see the fact that countries forming a third force are now watching the People's Republic of China with trust and admiration.

    The relationship and cooperation between Cambodia and China sets an example for all peace-loving countries, and I hope that people can objectively evaluate, cherish, and follow this example, and I end my speech with this hope.

    Finally, please allow me to raise my glass,

    To the prosperity of the People's Republic of China,

    To the new and great achievements of the Chinese government,

    To the happiness and prosperity of the Chinese people,

    To the health of Chairman Mao Zedong,

    To the health of Chairman Liu Shaoqi,

    To the health of Premier Zhou Enlai,

    To the health and happiness of our good friend Marshal Chen Yi and his wife, who are present here today,

    To the health of the Governor and his wife,

    To the new and great achievements of the people of Guangdong Province,

    And to the even more fruitful and unbreakable friendship between Cambodia and China, and to world peace!

    在欢送西哈努克亲王宴会上
    西哈努克亲王的讲话
    新华社广州25日电　西哈努克亲王在欢送他的宴会上的讲话，全文如下：元帅先生，省长先生，女士们，先生们：
    请允许我向广东省省长先生对于我们代表团以及整个高棉人民所讲的热情、友好和亲切的语言表示深切的感激。
    我以愉快而激动的心情再一次来到广州，这个已经从我们心坎中感到亲切的城市，每一次都给予我们非常真诚和兄弟般的接待。
    陈毅元帅阁下刚才对于我国和高棉人民所讲的如此亲切和真诚的话，使我非常感动。这些话以纯洁和激动人心的感情，表达了把我们两国连接在一起的友谊。请允许我借此机会回顾陈毅元帅先生对发展中柬友谊所起的作用。
    对于中国兄弟来讲，元帅同时是伟大的人民士兵，被尊敬的外交家，一位积极的战士和诗人。对于柬埔寨人来说，他是而且永远是我们的充满热力的忠实的朋友，他曾经以他的谅解和毫无保留的支持，援助过我们的遭到威胁的国家。我们将永远不会忘记，当外国军队侵占了我们的一个省分，当某一个外国政府竟然敢于对我们的沿海岛屿提出领土要求的时候，陈毅元帅毫不含糊地以令人钦佩的明确语言，表达了六亿五千万中国人民的警告。中国采取的这种立场给与我国人民以更大的信心，同时使得那些威胁我们和不真诚拥护万隆原则的人产生了有益的戒心。
    两年以前，陈毅元帅也曾陪同我们来到广州，表示了他对我国的尊重。今天，同两年以前一样，我们又荣幸地来到了这里，但是陈毅夫人的光临使我们感到格外高兴。1959年陈毅夫人曾经作为新中国的令人钦佩的和尊敬的使者访问过柬埔寨。
    能够授予陈毅元帅以我国的最高荣誉勋章，这对所有高棉人是很大的光荣和愉快。陈毅元帅是以中国人民和中国政府的名义接受这个勋章的，他便成为柬埔寨的最高贵的人物之一，并成为连结中国和柬埔寨的非常珍贵的桥梁。
  我们即将结束在柬埔寨和高棉全体人民当作兄弟看待的中国的难以忘怀的访问。在北京，我们受到了最高荣誉的款待。不论是从集宁到北京，或是从北京到南京、杭州、广州，我们都能够感觉到一种完全自发的友谊和团结。这种友谊和团结为两国人民的利益，为和平的未来，为我们亚洲大陆的建设，正在不断地发扬光大。
    但是，这次访问也使我们能够看到人民中国是以何种宽广的规模在发展着，使我们能够赞赏中国人民在社会主义政权的领导下，以何等的天才，用越来越迅速的速度，在进步的道路上发展自己的国家。在你们的令人赞叹的新成就中，我们为自己的国家建设吸取了新的宝贵的经验。中国给予我们的又一次重大的物质和技术援助，以及贵国人民给我们作出的杰出的榜样，使我们能够满怀信心地展望着未来。
    其次，我们同杰出的中国领导人，同充满智慧和远见的毛泽东主席，同对我们如此谅解的刘少奇主席，同因他们的毅力、真诚以及对和平和正义的热爱而博得人们敬仰的周恩来总理和陈毅元帅，同中国政府的所有成员以及中国高级当局进行了会晤及会谈。在这些会谈中，我们就全人类所关注的国际重大问题交换了意见。我们以特别愉快的心情注意到中国和柬埔寨的立场是非常接近的，在有关保卫和平、正义和自由以及各国人民要求独立与进步的权利等一切问题上，我们的行动和我们的目标是一致的。
    我们正是以这种正义的名义，曾经要求，而且将不断地要求承认中华人民共和国参加一切国际性会议的权利，特别是作为中国人民唯一的真正代表参加联合国的权利。我们也正是以这种正义的名义，衷心地期望一切国际公认属于中国的领土，迅速归还中华人民共和国。
    新中国由于她的勇敢、干劲以及和平与进步的愿望，在世界上占有首要的地位。所有不参加集团的中、小国家一致公认新中国的这一地位，这种地位是任何人不能剥夺，甚至不能否认的。显然，我们柬埔寨人兴奋地看到这样的事实：形成第三种力量的国家现在正怀着信任和钦佩的心情注视着中华人民共和国。
    柬埔寨和中国之间的关系和合作为一切爱好和平的国家树立了榜样，我希望人们能够客观地评价、珍视和遵循这个榜样，并以这一希望来结束我的讲话。
    最后，请允许我举杯，
    祝中华人民共和国昌盛，
    祝中国政府取得新的巨大的成就，
    祝中国人民幸福繁荣，
    祝毛泽东主席阁下健康，
    祝刘少奇主席阁下健康，
    祝周恩来总理阁下健康，
    祝今天在座的我们的好朋友陈毅元帅阁下和夫人健康幸福，
    祝省长先生和夫人健康，
    祝广东省人民取得新的巨大的成就，
    并且为柬埔寨和中国之间将结出更为丰硕的果实和牢不可破的友谊，以及世界和平而干杯！
