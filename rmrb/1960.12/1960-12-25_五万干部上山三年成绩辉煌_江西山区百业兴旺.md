    Five Thousand Cadres Go to the Mountains for Three Years with Remarkable Achievements
    Jiangxi Mountainous Areas Prosper in All Undertakings
    (By our newspaper) Jiangxi's fifty thousand cadres have gone to the mountains for three years, and together with the people of the mountainous areas, they have held high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, and comprehensively exploiting the treasures of the mountainous areas. They have built more than 300 state-owned comprehensive reclamation farms and farms in the deep mountains and dense forests, greatly changing the "poor and blank" face of the mountainous areas. At the same time, the vast number of cadres who went to the mountains have been well-trained in the battle to develop the mountainous areas, their socialist and communist consciousness has been greatly enhanced, their collectivist ideology has been greatly strengthened, and they have formed a good style and virtue of loving labor and loving the mountainous areas.
    In the great struggle to build a new socialist mountainous area, the fifty thousand cadres who went to the mountains in Jiangxi and the people of the mountainous areas resolutely implemented the policy of "taking grain as the key link and making an all-round leap forward." In the past three years, most of the more than 300 state-owned comprehensive reclamation farms and farms established by the transferred cadres have placed the development of grain production in the primary position, combining extensive planting and harvesting with high-yield harvesting. While constantly expanding the cultivated area, they also paid attention to increasing the yield per unit area. Now they have reclaimed a total of more than 1.1 million mu of wasteland, and the multiple cropping index has reached more than 194%, so that grain output has increased year by year. This year's total grain output has increased by about 10% on the basis of last year's bumper harvest. Many reclamation farms and farms have achieved self-sufficiency in grain, and some have surplus grain. The grain sowing area of ​​the state-owned Heshan Comprehensive Reclamation Farm has expanded by more than 11,000 mu in three years. The total grain output increased from more than 1.15 million jin in 1957 to more than 2.33 million jin this year, turning a grain-deficient mountainous area into a grain-surplus mountainous area. The Damao Mountain, Huashan, and Jiguanshan reclamation farms vigorously promoted the intercropping of forests and grains in the case of many mountains and few fields, and a new situation of double leap forward in forests and grains appeared. While developing grain production, the production of cotton, oil, sugarcane, hemp, tea and fruit trees in various reclamation farms and farms has also been greatly developed.
    Under the premise of accelerating the development of agricultural production, the reclamation farms and farms have also developed forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, fishery and industry according to local conditions. In the past three years, the afforestation area has reached 4.97 million mu, more than 100,000 mu of fruit trees have been planted, more than 30,000 mu of mulberry gardens have been cultivated, and more than 2.5 million cubic meters of wood and more than 20 million bamboo poles have been harvested, which has strongly supported national construction. 1.59 million pigs, more than 22,000 sheep, and 7.72 million poultry were developed. There was no fishery in the mountainous areas in the past, but now 600,000 mu of water surface have been operated, and more than 300 million fish have been raised. After the cadres went to the mountains, more than 2,400 industrial enterprises including iron and steel, electricity, machinery, smelting, oil and fat, forest chemical industry, papermaking, and brewing were built in the mountainous areas. These industries are all built on the spot, processed on the spot, and built in a simple way, which has greatly promoted serving agriculture, supporting the construction of mountainous areas, and accelerating the development and utilization of abundant resources in mountainous areas.
    The cultural, health, and scientific undertakings in the mountainous areas have also developed with the development of production. In particular, the establishment and expansion of the communist labor university with half-work and half-study has become a base for Jiangxi Province to train red and expert talents for the construction of mountainous areas. At present, there are more than 200 scientific research institutions and more than 470 health care units in various state-owned comprehensive reclamation farms and farms.
    In the great labor of building a new socialist mountainous area, the fifty thousand cadres who went to the mountains also tempered their thinking and increased their talents. They further realized the great significance of physical labor, and realized the truth that physical labor is the first need of people's lives. A comrade from the Wuyishan Reclamation Farm wrote in his diary: "The greatest happiness in life is labor, especially the labor of building socialism. Leaving the practice of production labor struggle, life is empty and meaningless." In the past three years, the cadres who went to the mountains have lived, eaten, labored, and consulted with the broad masses of the people, lived together day and night, shared weal and woe, produced together, and struggled together, and formed a flesh-and-blood relationship with the broad masses of the people. Because they are constantly influenced by the excellent qualities of the working people, their thoughts and feelings are integrated with the thoughts and feelings of the broad masses of the people, and they gradually overcome bourgeois ideas and individualism, establish a style of close contact with the masses, and enhance their mass viewpoint. In the production labor, Comrade Deng Zijian of Zhanggongshan Reclamation Farm overcame the original erroneous idea that laboring peasants were both "rough" and "dirty", and realized that only those bourgeois who have ugly souls and beautiful appearances are the dirtiest people. In production labor, tens of thousands of cadres have improved their practical skills in building socialism, and developed their talents in production practice, so that theory is further linked with practice, and science is combined with production. Comrade Lan Youfu of Damaoshan Reclamation Farm broke superstitions and gave play to his pioneering spirit, and used indigenous methods to extract important industrial raw materials such as acetone and butanol from Lycoris radiata. Among the 304 cadres in Yongxin Reclamation Farm, 251 have reached the level of primary agricultural technicians and secondary agricultural technicians, 68 understand forestry technology, 15 have learned forest surveying technology, 44 have learned animal husbandry and veterinary technology, and 156 have mastered charcoal burning and iron smelting technology. In the great furnace of labor training, these cadres who went to the mountains have gradually grown into strong fighters who are both red and expert, capable of both writing and fighting.
    Now, all the cadres and workers of the state-owned reclamation farms and farms in the province are actively responding to the call of the Party and have invested in a new upsurge of vigorous agricultural production and grain production. At present, they have newly reclaimed more than 300,000 mu of lake fields and lands, vowing to win a bumper harvest in agricultural production next year. (Attached picture)

    五万干部上山三年成绩辉煌
    江西山区百业兴旺
    本报讯　江西五万干部上山三年，同山区人民一道，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，大办农业、大办粮食，全面开发山区宝藏。他们在深山密林中兴建起三百多个国营综合垦殖场和农场，大大改变了山区“一穷二白”的面貌。同时，广大上山干部在开发山区的战斗中，得到了很好的锻炼，社会主义和共产主义觉悟大大提高，集体主义思想大大加强，形成了热爱劳动，热爱山区的良好风尚和美德。
    江西五万上山干部和山区人民，在建设社会主义新山区的伟大斗争中，坚决贯彻执行了“以粮为纲，全面跃进”的方针。三年来，由下放干部建立起的三百多个国营综合垦殖场和农场中，大部分都把发展粮食生产放在首要地位，把广种多收和高产多收结合起来，在不断扩大耕地面积的同时也注意提高单位面积产量。现在他们已开垦的荒地共达一百一十多万亩，复种指数达到了194％以上，从而使粮食产量逐年上升。今年的粮食总产量在去年丰收的基础上又增产了10％左右。许多垦殖场和农场已实现了粮食自给，有的还有余粮。国营鹤山综合垦殖场粮食播种面积三年中就扩大了一万一千多亩。粮食总产量由1957年的一百一十五万多斤，增加到今年的二百三十三万多斤，把一个缺粮的山区变为余粮的山区。大茅山、华山、鸡冠山等垦殖场，在山多田少的情况下，大力推行了林粮混作，出现了林粮双跃进的新景象。在发展粮食生产的同时，各垦殖场和农场的棉花、油料、甘蔗、麻类、茶叶和果木生产等都有较大发展。
    在加速发展农业生产的前提下，各垦殖场和农场也因地制宜地发展了林、牧、副、渔和工业。三年来，造林面积达四百九十七万亩，栽植果树十万多亩，培育桑园三万多亩，并采伐了木材二百五十多万立方米，茅竹二千多万根，有力地支援了国家建设。发展生猪一百五十九万头，羊二万二千多只，家禽七百七十二万只。山区过去没有渔业，现在也经营了六十万亩水面，共养鱼三亿多尾。干部上山后，在山区建起了二千四百多个包括钢铁、电力、机械、冶炼、油脂、林产化工、造纸、酿酒等工业企业。这些工业都是就地取材，就地加工，因陋就简建立起来的，对服务农业，支援山区建设，和加速开发利用山区丰富资源都起了很大的促进作用。
    山区的文化、卫生、科学事业随着生产的发展，也发展起来。特别是半工半读的共产主义劳动大学的建立和壮大，已成为江西省培养建设山区的红专人才的基地。目前，各国营综合垦殖场和农场已有二百多个科学研究机构和四百七十多个卫生医疗单位。
    五万上山干部在建设社会主义新山区的伟大劳动中，也炼红了思想，增长了才能。他们进一步认识了体力劳动的伟大意义，认识了体力劳动是人们生活第一需要的道理。武夷山垦殖场一个同志在日记上写着：“人生最大幸福就是劳动，特别是建设社会主义的劳动，脱离生产劳动斗争实践，生活就是空虚的，没有意义的。”三年来，上山干部在生产劳动中，同广大人民群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，朝夕相处，甘苦与共，一道生产，一同斗争，和广大人民结成了血肉的联系。他们由于不断受到劳动人民优秀品质的熏陶，使自己思想和感情同广大人民的思想感情融合起来，逐步克服了资产阶级思想和个人主义思想，树立了密切联系群众的作风，增强了群众观点。鄣公山垦殖场邓子健同志在生产劳动中，克服了原先认为劳动农民又“粗”又“脏”的错误思想，认识到只有那些灵魂丑恶外表堂皇的资产阶级才是最脏的人。在生产劳动中几万干部提高了建设社会主义的实际本领，并且在生产实践中发展了自己的才智，使理论进一步联系了实际，科学与生产相结合。大茅山垦殖场蓝有福同志破除迷信，发挥首创精神，用土法从石蒜中提炼出丙酮、丁醇等重要工业原料。永新垦殖场全场三百零四名干部中，有二百五十一名达到了初级农业技术员和二级农业技术员的水平，懂得林业技术的有六十八人；学会森林测绘技术的有十五人；学会畜牧兽医技术的有四十四人；掌握烧炭炼铁技术的有一百五十六人。在劳动锻炼的伟大熔炉中，这些上山干部已逐步成长为又红又专、能文能武的坚强战士。
    现在，全省国营垦殖场和农场全体干部和职工，积极响应党的号召，投入了热火朝天的大办农业、大办粮食的生产新高潮，目前他们又新垦湖田洲地三十余万亩，誓夺明年农业生产大丰收。（附图片）
