Xinhua News Agency, Rome: The Italian working people's strike struggle is surging. The strike of Milan electrical workers and 100,000 workers in the national confectionery industry is still ongoing. On December 1st, Milan electrical workers held another demonstration and a massive protest meeting in Piazza del Duomo.

	At the same time, workers sent representatives to visit the heads of some bourgeois newspapers to protest their disregard and distortion of the workers' struggle.

	Police attacked the workers who were meeting in the square but were resolutely repelled by the workers.

	About twenty demonstrating workers were arrested by the police.

	Meanwhile, 250,000 female olive pickers announced a two-day strike starting on November 28th. These female workers are distributed in Apulia, Calabria, Campania, and other regions of southern Italy. They are demanding that wages be increased from the current 400 to 700 lire (Italian currency) per day to 1,100 lire, and that the current working hours of 10 to 12 hours per day be reduced to 8 hours.

	Thirty-six thousand textile workers in northern Italy also held a strike on November 26th. In the Tuscany region, 15,000 women who work at home in the clothing industry also entered their second day of strike. More than 1,000 of them demonstrated in front of their employers' factories.

	The struggle of 70,000 kiln workers has achieved victory after two national strikes. They won their demands for a 10% wage increase and shorter working hours.

Xinhua News Agency, Athens, December 4th: Construction workers in the Greek capital angrily held a 24-hour strike on December 2nd and demonstrated again to protest the Greek authorities' barbaric suppression of workers the day before, and to show support for the arrested workers.

	On December 1st, a march by 10,000 construction workers was met with a frenzied crackdown by the police, with more than 150 workers injured and many arrested.

	When more than 1,000 construction workers marched in protest on December 2nd, the Athens authorities dispatched a large number of police again, using batons and tear gas to attack the demonstrators. The workers put up a heroic resistance. According to preliminary statistics, another 45 unarmed workers were injured by the police, and a number of people were arrested.

	It is reported that the number of demonstrators arrested the day before has reached 179. The government's atrocities have aroused widespread dissatisfaction among the Greek public.
