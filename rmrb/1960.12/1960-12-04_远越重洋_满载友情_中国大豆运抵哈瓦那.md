Sailing Across the Ocean, Full of Friendship
Chinese Soybeans Arrive in Havana

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, December 2nd. The "Rik Skau" ship carrying 5,500 tons of Chinese soybeans arrived in Havana today. These Chinese soybeans were warmly welcomed by the Cuban people.

According to an expert from an oil pressing factory, the American soybeans they used to use for oil extraction were very small, only about the size of small lentils. Since the United States imposed an embargo on Cuba, the factory has been severely short of raw materials. The arrival of Chinese soybeans made people very happy. The ship also brought a large number of Chinese toys for Cuban rural children to celebrate the New Year. People have been waiting for a while for Chinese exquisite and beautiful toys that are also educational.

    远越重洋  满载友情
    中国大豆运抵哈瓦那
    新华社哈瓦那2日电　由“里克·斯库号”轮船运来的五千五百吨中国大豆今天抵达哈瓦那。这些中国大豆受到古巴人的热烈欢迎。
    据一个榨油厂的专家说，他们厂过去榨油用的美国大豆颗粒很小，只有小菜豆那么大。在美国对古巴实行禁运以后，这个厂的原料非常缺乏。中国大豆的抵达使人们很高兴。这艘船还运来了给古巴农村儿童过新年用的大量的中国玩具。人们从一个时期以来就等待着中国精致而漂亮的并且富于教育意义的玩具。
