Xinhua News Agency, December 26th. Cambodian Head of State Prince Norodom Sihanouk, at the invitation of the Central People's Broadcasting Station, delivered a radio address to Chinese listeners this evening. The full text of the speech is as follows:

　　I am very grateful to the Broadcasting Station of the People's Republic of China for giving me the opportunity to speak directly to the great Chinese people. I am very pleased to extend brotherly greetings on behalf of the Khmer people to the Chinese people, workers, peasants, intellectuals, artists, staff members of organizations, and soldiers of the People's Army.

　　Our official visit to the People's Republic of China this time is a great success for peace and Asian unity. Because a treaty of friendship and non-aggression has cemented the friendship between our two countries, this is a new step on the road to cooperation.

　　The Cambodian-Chinese friendship, so powerfully demonstrated today, was established at the beginning of our country's restoration of national independence, and has since developed continuously according to the principles of peaceful coexistence. This is of great benefit to the people of our two countries, to Asia, and to world peace.

　　During our re-visit to your country, on the one hand, we have fixed our unbreakable friendship through formal documents announced to the world. At the same time, we have also seen your new and great achievements. These achievements most powerfully prove what the people of a country can create with their own courage, perseverance, confidence and unity. Asian and African countries and peoples are watching with admiration the efforts and achievements made by New China. From them they see the great future of China which is closely linked to the future of a large part of humanity. Cambodia hails every new achievement of the Chinese people, and thereby enhances its confidence in its own future.

　　Our stay in your magnificent capital, which is developing at an astonishing speed, has also enabled us to exchange views with China's outstanding leaders on major international issues. We are very pleased to note that the issues we are concerned about are identical, and the solutions we advocate are often consistent, and there has never been any opposition or disagreement. This is because the people of our two countries abhor war and love peace, and they only want to engage in peaceful construction; this is because we have the same sense of justice and firmly defend our independence, and do not allow people to infringe upon our national sovereignty and territorial integrity; this is because we consistently act in accordance with the principles of peaceful coexistence.

　　The powerful material and spiritual strength of New China has made an effective contribution to maintaining peace in Asia and the world, and to ensuring that the rights of threatened and oppressed people are respected. We are pleased to see that China is playing an increasingly important role in international affairs. In particular, we would like to express our respect for the support and selfless assistance that New China has given to those countries and peoples who are struggling arduously with their meager strength to get rid of backwardness quickly. The brotherhood and solidarity of the Chinese people towards all nations, large and small, fully embodies the sincerity of China.

　　Dearest friends,

　　Cambodia and the Khmer people express their friendship to you, this friendship is unbreakable, unreserved, and proud of the affection you constantly express to them. From now on, Cambodia and China have become the two closest relatives, and no force can separate them.

　　Please allow me, on behalf of our country and people, to express our deep gratitude to your great country, to her wise leaders, and to her so hospitable and brotherly people.

　　I and the Khmer people extend our warmest congratulations to you, wish the People's Republic of China prosperity, wish you new and brilliant achievements in peaceful construction, wish all the working people of China prosperity and happiness, and wish peace in Asia and the world.

    西哈努克亲王向中国人民发表广播讲话
    柬埔寨中国成了最亲密的亲戚
    新华社26日讯　中央人民广播电台今天晚上广播了柬埔寨国家元首诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王应这个电台邀请向中国听众发表的广播讲话。讲话全文如下：
    我非常感谢中华人民共和国广播电台给了我直接向伟大的中国人民讲话的机会。我很高兴代表高棉人民向中国人民、工人、农民、知识分子、艺术家、机关工作人员以及人民军队的士兵致以兄弟般的敬意。
    我们这次在中华人民共和国的正式访问，对于和平和亚洲的团结来说，是一个很大的成功。因为一项友好和互不侵犯条约已经把我们两国之间的友谊固定下来，这是合作道路上新的一步。
    今天这样有力地表现出来的柬中友谊，是在我国恢复民族独立之初建立起来的，并从那时起根据和平共处原则不断发展，这对于我们两国人民、对于亚洲和世界和平，都有莫大的裨益。
    在你们国家再次进行访问期间，一方面通过向全世界宣布的正式文件固定了我们的牢不可破的友谊，同时我们也看到了你们新的巨大成就，这种成就最有力地证明了一个国家的人民凭着自己的勇敢、坚毅、信心和团结所能创建的事业。亚非国家和人民以钦佩的心情注视着新中国所作出的努力、所取得的成就，他们从中看到了同很大一部分人类的前途紧密联结在一起的中国的伟大前途。柬埔寨欢呼中国人民的每一项新的成就，并因而对自己的前途增强了信心。
    在你们的以惊人速度发展着的宏伟首都的逗留，也使我们能够同中国的杰出领导人就重大国际问题交换意见。我们很高兴地注意到我们所关心的问题是雷同的，我们所主张的解决办法往往是一致的，始终没有出现对立或分歧。这是因为我们两国人民都痛恨战争、热爱和平，他们只希望从事和平建设；这是因为我们有同样的正义感，坚定地捍卫我们的独立，不容许人们侵犯我们的民族主权和领土完整；这是因为我们始终如一地依据和平共处原则行事。
    新中国的强大的物质和精神力量，对于维护亚洲和世界和平、对于使受威胁和被压迫的人民的权利得到尊重，作出了有效的贡献。我们高兴地看到中国在国际事务中起着日益重要的作用。我们特别要对新中国给予那些为了迅速摆脱落后状态，以自己微薄的力量进行艰巨斗争的国家和人民的支持和无私援助表示敬意。中国人民对待不论大小民族的这种兄弟情谊和团结精神，充分体现了中国的真诚。
    最亲爱的朋友们：
    柬埔寨和高棉人民对你们表示友好，这种友谊是牢不可破的、是毫无保留的，而且为你们不断向他们所表示的情谊感到自豪。从今以后，柬埔寨和中国成了两个最亲密的亲戚，任何力量不能把她们分开。
    请允许我代表我们的国家和人民向你们伟大的国家，向她的英明领导人，向她的那么好客、那么亲如兄弟的人民表示深切的谢意。
    我和高棉人民向你们表达最热烈的祝贺，祝中华人民共和国强盛，祝你们在和平建设中取得新的辉煌成就，祝中国全体劳动人民繁荣幸福，祝亚洲和世界和平。
