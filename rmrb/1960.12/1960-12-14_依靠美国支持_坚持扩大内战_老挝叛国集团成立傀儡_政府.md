Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 13th: According to broadcasts from the radio station of the Lao traitorous clique in Savannakhet, the puppet "government" cobbled together by US imperialism and its Lao lackeys, the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak traitorous clique, was proclaimed on the 12th in Savannakhet, the headquarters of this traitorous group.

According to the broadcast, this so-called "government" includes seventeen members, with Boun Oum Na Champassak serving as Prime Minister and Phoumi Nosavan as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense and Veterans Affairs.

The Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique gathered and coerced some members of parliament in Vientiane to go to Savannakhet, forcing them to hold a meeting on the 12th to cobble together this puppet "government." At the same time, this traitorous clique also coerced the Lao King, who was surrounded by rebel troops in Luang Prabang, to order the "dissolution" of the legal government of the Kingdom of Laos headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma.

    据新华社河内13日电　据老挝叛国集团在沙湾拿吉的电台广播，美帝国主义及其在老挝的走狗富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞叛国集团所拼凑的傀儡“政府”已于12日在这个叛国集团的总部沙湾拿吉宣告成立。
    据广播，这个所谓的“政府”包括十七名成员，由文翁·纳占巴塞担任首相，富米·诺萨万任副首相兼国防、复员军人部大臣。
    富米—文翁叛国集团纠集和挟持部分在万象的议员前往沙湾拿吉，迫使他们在12日举行会议，拼凑这个傀儡“政府”。同时，这个叛国集团还挟持在琅勃拉邦被叛军包围的老挝国王下令“解散”以富马亲王为首的老挝王国的合法政府。
