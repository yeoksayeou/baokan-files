Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 10th: According to reports in local newspapers, the last unit – the twenty-first hydraulic unit – of the famous Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station on the Volga River, was put into operation on the evening of December 9th, a year ahead of schedule. With this, the world's largest hydroelectric station is declared fully completed.

The total power generation capacity of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station is 2,415,000 kilowatts, more than 100,000 kilowatts greater than the total power generation capacity of the Lenin Volga Hydroelectric Station (formerly known as the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station), another Volga River hydroelectric station that was fully completed and put into operation in August 1958, making it currently the world's largest hydroelectric station. In addition, for experimental purposes, another hydraulic unit will be installed in this hydroelectric station. At that time, its power generation capacity will reach 2,563,000 kilowatts.

This hydroelectric station will generate a total of 14 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, which is seven times more than the total annual power generation of all power stations in Tsarist Russia before the October Revolution in 1913. Before being fully put into operation, it had already produced 6.2 billion kilowatt-hours of the cheapest electricity in the country for the state.

With the completion of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station, the grand plan to establish a unified power grid in the European part of the Soviet Union has entered its final stage. Through the Stalingrad-Moscow high-voltage power transmission line (voltage of 500,000 volts) that has already been built and the Stalingrad-Donbass power transmission line (voltage of 800,000 volts) that is under construction, this hydroelectric station will become an important hub, connecting the existing Ural power grid, the central power grid, and the southern power grid. The completion of this hydroelectric station will also bring great changes to the downstream of the Volga River, making it possible to solve a series of important problems related to the development of the national economy: it can use cheap electricity to supply Moscow, the Volga River Basin, the Central Black Earth Region, the Donbass, and other industrial areas of the Soviet Union; it can irrigate and provide water sources for 1.5 million hectares of land in the lower Volga River Basin and the Black Sea coastal lowlands, as well as 6 million hectares of arid land; and it makes it possible to build deep-water shipping lanes in the lower Volga River.

The Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station is the second-to-last cascade hydroelectric station in the Volga River hydroelectric station cascade. Its full commissioning marks the near completion of the grand plan to transform the Volga River, which has been underway for more than 20 years.

The decision to build this hydroelectric station was made in 1950. Its grand construction scale and complex natural conditions required construction workers to complete a huge amount of construction and installation work. According to statistics, in order to complete the important construction projects of the power station alone, the workers excavated 148 million cubic meters of earth, poured 5.44 million cubic meters of cement and reinforced concrete, and installed 82,900 tons of metal structures and mechanical equipment.

British power engineer Sitlin, who visited this construction project several years ago, said that he had seen many construction projects in Italy, France, and the United States, but he had never seen a construction scale as amazing as the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station.

In the construction of this currently unparalleled hydroelectric station, Soviet construction workers actively exerted their labor enthusiasm and creativity, and adopted advanced construction technology and rapid installation methods, resulting in being ahead of schedule, so that the first hydraulic unit of the hydroelectric station started generating electricity on December 23, 1958, a year ahead of the original plan. And now, after only two years, the entire hydroelectric station has been put into production greatly ahead of schedule. At the same time, due to the widespread adoption of industrialized construction methods, mechanized assembly line operations, and the use of advanced building structures and building materials in the construction, the basic construction investment of this hydroelectric station, which is larger than the Lenin Volga Hydroelectric Station, is 3.1 billion rubles less than that of the Lenin Volga Hydroelectric Station. According to expert calculations, its entire construction investment can be fully recovered in the next few years. (Photo attached)

### 标志着改造伏尔加河的宏伟计划接近完成  世界最大的斯大林格勒水电站建成  年发电量比一九一三年沙皇俄国全部电站的发电量多七倍

    标志着改造伏尔加河的宏伟计划接近完成
    世界最大的斯大林格勒水电站建成
    年发电量比一九一三年沙皇俄国全部电站的发电量多七倍
    新华社莫斯科10日电　据此间报纸报道，伏尔加河上著名的斯大林格勒水电站的最后一台——第二十一台水力联动机，已经提前一年于12月9日晚上投入生产。至此，这座世界上最大的水电站就宣告全部建成。
    斯大林格勒水电站的总发电能力为二百四十一万五千瓩，比在1958年8月全部建成和投入生产的伏尔加河上另一座列宁伏尔加水电站（旧称古比雪夫水电站）的总发电能力还多十多万瓩，而成为目前世界上最大的水电站。此外，为了实验性的目的，这个水电站还将安装另一台水力联动机。那时，它的发电能力还将达到二百五十六万三千瓩。
    这座水电站每年总共将生产一百四十亿度电，这比十月革命前1913年沙皇俄国所有发电站全年的全部发电量还多七倍。而在全部投入生产以前，它已经为国家生产了六十二亿度全国最便宜的电力。
    随着斯大林格勒水电站的建成，建立苏联欧洲部分统一动力网的宏伟计划，就进入最后完成阶段。通过已经建成的斯大林格勒—莫斯科高压输电线（电压为五十万伏特）和正在建设的斯大林格勒—顿巴斯输电线（电压为八十万伏特），这座水电站将成为一个重要枢纽，把现在的乌拉尔电力网、中央电力网同南部电力网联结起来。这座水电站的建成，还将使伏尔加河下游的面貌发生很大变化，将使得有可能解决一系列与发展国民经济有关的重要问题：它可以用廉价的电力供应莫斯科、伏尔加河流域、中央黑土地带、顿巴斯以及苏联其它工业地区；可以使下伏尔加河流域和黑海沿岸低地的一百五十万公顷土地和六百万公顷的干旱地得到灌溉和水源；并使得在伏尔加河下游可以建设深水航运线路。
    斯大林格勒水电站是伏尔加河上水电站梯级中倒数第二座梯级水电站。它的全部投入生产，标志着已经进行了二十多年的改造伏尔加河的宏伟计划，已接近完成。
    这座水电站是在1950年决定建设的。它的宏伟的建设规模、复杂的自然条件，要求建设工人们完成庞大的建设和安装工程量。据统计，单是为了完成电站的重要建设工程，工人们就挖掘了一亿四千八百万土方，灌浇了五百四十四万立方米水泥和钢骨混凝土，安装了八万二千九百吨金属结构和机械设备。
    几年前访问过这个建设工程的英国动力学家西特林说过，他曾在意大利、法国和美国看到许多建设工程，但从来没有看到过像斯大林格勒水电站那样惊人的建设规模。
    在建设这个目前举世无双的水电站时，苏联建设工人积极发挥了劳动热情和创造性，采用了先进的建筑技术和快速的安装方法，结果就赶在时间前面，使水电站的第一台水力联动机比原计划提前一年，于1958年12月23日开始发电。而现在，仅仅过了两年，又使整个水电站大大提前投入生产。同时，由于在建设中广泛地采用了工业化施工方法、机械化流水作业法，并采用了先进的建筑结构和建筑材料，这座比列宁伏尔加水电站大的水电站，其基本建设投资却比列宁伏尔加水电站少三十一亿卢布。据专家计算，它的全部建设投资，在最近几年就可以全部收回。（附图片）
