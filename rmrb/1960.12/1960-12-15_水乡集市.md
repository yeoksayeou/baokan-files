    Market in a Water Town
    By Our Staff Reporter
    Before dawn, trading had already begun in Tangqi Town, a market town in the river network region of southern Jiangsu. Members of the People's Commune, in groups of three or five, arrived in town on small boats via the Grand Canal, which runs through the town, and the large and small rivers that extend from the town in all directions. The roads were also busy with people carrying shoulder poles and baskets. They were all using the time before their daily work to bring collective or family-produced goods to the town to participate in the daily market. The canteens of some factories, enterprises, and organizations in the town also sent people to the market to purchase the agricultural and sideline products they needed.
    The market square in the center of the town was bustling with people, and trading was very active. A wide variety of agricultural and sideline products were neatly arranged by category in the market. There were all kinds of seasonal fresh vegetables, fresh fish with their mouths open and tails twitching in baskets, plump chickens and ducks, delicious mutton, yellow local oranges, sugarcane leaning against the walls, eggs in bamboo baskets, game hanging on shoulder poles, bundles of vegetable seedlings, pairs of rabbits, batches of firewood, and many small handicrafts. State-owned stores and commune supply and marketing cooperatives had established supply points in the market square, including teahouses, butcher shops, tofu shops, non-staple food stores, small handicraft stores, small means of production supply stores, vegetable stores, and breeding stock supply stores. Mobile service points run by town residents were also active in the market, enthusiastically serving the market by repairing umbrellas and galoshes, darning socks, repairing pots, sharpening scissors, and so on.
    People participating in the market could choose and purchase what they needed and liked from these stores and products. A farmer in his fifties sold the Chinese cabbage he grew on his private plot, went to the general merchandise store, and bought socks, towels, soap, and other items. His name is Zhu Zhengcai, a member of the Jiangshan Production Team. In addition to actively participating in the collective labor of the team, he also cultivated his three-point private plot in his spare time and raised chickens, sheep, rabbits, and other domestic animals and poultry. Previously, his family had to buy vegetables in town, but now his family had a large surplus of fresh vegetables that he could take to the market to sell. Next to the stall was a long line of stalls made up of dozens of bamboo baskets, filled with various vegetable seedlings. A member of the Zhengjiadi Production Team bought 7,000 seedlings of Youdong'er cabbage seedlings sold by the Sanguantang Production Team for more than 20 yuan at one time. At the other end of the market square, Ma Youcai and Pan Tianlong, members of the Lijiabao Production Team, brought four loads of fresh and tender vegetables left over from their canteen on a small boat and sold them to the canteen of the Chongyu Silk Factory located on the edge of the town. With the 20 yuan they earned, they bought oil, salt, and other items. The canteen of this production team had recently increased the area planted with vegetables from 17 mu to 26 mu. Since winter, they had harvested several hundred loads of vegetables. In addition to feeding the 200-plus households of the canteen, they also sold one-third in the market. The canteen had a thick foundation, and all the members were satisfied.
    On the streets, members of the commune also gathered at the entrances of various state-owned stores and purchasing stations, driving plump live pigs, white Huzhou sheep, and various chickens, ducks, and other poultry one by one from the boats to the purchasing stations to sell. Some of them came to fulfill their task of selling to the state, while others sold their surplus products after completing their task. In the fur purchasing station, various animal skins stretched with bamboo bows hung all around. Members of the Nianyu Jiao Production Team used their spare time to capture more than 500 wild ducks, wild chickens, wild rabbits, waterfowl, etc. by the river and in the fields. That day, they took the meat of these birds and wild rabbits to the market to sell, and sold the furs to the state-owned purchasing station, using the money earned as the team's sideline income.
    In the market, there were also a variety of small stalls and repair services. Every morning around six o'clock, they started working and continued to serve customers until five o'clock in the afternoon. Near the bridge spanning the canal on the street, Wang Acai and his wife, who ran a mobile umbrella and rubber shoe repair service, were repairing an umbrella frame for a member of the commune. People in the market square, after selling their products, could walk a few steps to buy the small means of production and daily necessities they generally needed, as well as steaming tofu, bright red fermented bean curd, and so on.
    Around seven o'clock in the morning, the busiest time of the day in the market passed. Members of the commune sold the products they brought, exchanged them for the means of production and daily necessities needed by the production team, the small team, or the family, and left the market with satisfaction, embarking on their journey home, eager to devote themselves to the day's production labor.
    Tangqi Town is located at the junction of the Qiantang Joint Commune in the suburbs of Hangzhou and Deqing County, and belongs to Hangzhou City. The town is surrounded by endless rice fields, patches of mulberry orchards, and rivers and ponds where fish are raised. Tangqi loquats are famous throughout the country, as are ramie and Huzhou sheep. After communization, this area became even more prosperous. The Tangqi Commune alone increased grain production by 29% this year compared to 1957; during the same period, the number of pigs and sheep increased by 27.9% and 13.9% respectively. On the other hand, production teams, production small teams, and commune member families are constantly developing sideline production. Commune members use their private plots and land in front of and behind their houses to grow all kinds of things. In this way, commune member incomes have greatly increased. According to statistics, the average income per household this year increased by more than 140 yuan compared to last year. Due to the bumper harvest and the development of sideline production, the market in Tangqi Town has become increasingly lively. Commune members use this form to exchange what they have for what they need, and at the same time, it can better play a role in boosting the rural economy and promoting production.

    水乡集市
    本报记者
    东方欲晓，江南水网地区的一个集镇——塘栖镇，交易就已经开始了。人民公社的社员们，通过贯穿镇上的大运河，和由这个镇伸向四面八方的大小河道，划着小船，三五成群地来到镇上。大路上，也流动着人群，挑担的，提篮的，络绎不绝。他们都是利用每天上工以前的时间，带着集体或家庭生产的东西，到镇上来参加每日一次的集市。镇上的一些工厂、企业和机关的食堂，也派人来到集市购买自己需要的农副产品。
    设在镇中心的集市广场，人头浮动，交易十分活跃。市场上品种繁多的农副产品，分类整齐地排列着。这里有：各种各样的当令的新鲜蔬菜，在箩筐里装着张目翘尾的鲜鱼，肥壮的鸡和鸭，味美的羊肉，黄色的土桔，靠在墙壁上的甘蔗，装在篓子里的蛋类，挂在扁担上的狩猎物，一担一担的菜秧，一对一对的兔子，一批一批的柴火，还有许许多多小手工业品。国营商店和公社供销部在集市广场设立了供应点，包括茶馆、肉店、豆腐店、副食品店、小手工业店、小生产资料供应店、蔬菜店和种畜供应店。镇上居民的流动服务点也活跃在市场上，他们热情地为集市服务，有修雨伞套鞋的、补袜子的、修锅子的、磨剪刀的等等。
    参加集市的人们，在这些店和产品前，任随自己的需要和爱好进行选购。一个五十多岁的农民把自己自留地上种植的黄芽菜卖了，走到杂货店，买回了袜子、手巾、肥皂等。他叫诸正才，是江山生产队的社员，他除积极参加社里集体劳动外，还利用工余时间，经营着三分自留地，又养了鸡、羊、兔等家禽家畜。原先他家要到街上买菜吃的，现在是家有大量剩余新鲜蔬菜，可拿到集市出售了。紧挨着货摊的，是一条用几十副箩筐排着长队的摊头，这里装满了各种菜秧。郑家棣生产队的社员，这天就买到了三官塘生产队出售的油冬儿菜秧苗，一次就买了七千株苗，成交二十多元。在集市广场的另一端，李家桥生产队的社员马有才、潘天龙，摇着小船运来了食堂自吃有余的四担鲜嫩蔬菜，为设立在镇边的崇裕丝厂食堂买去了，卖得的二十元，买了油盐之类的东西。这个生产队的食堂，最近种的蔬菜已经从十七亩增加到二十六亩，冬季以来收了好几百担菜，除了这个食堂二百多户人家的食用，还在市场上卖出三分之一，食堂家底厚，社员个个满意。
    在大街上，各个国营商店的收购站门口也集聚着社员，他们把肥壮的生猪、白色的湖羊和各种鸡、鸭等家禽一个一个地从船上赶送到收购站来出售。他们有的是来完成向国家交售任务的，有的是在完成交售任务以后出售剩余产品的。在皮毛收购站里，四周挂满了用竹弓张着的各种兽皮。鲶鱼角生产队的社员，利用工余时间到河边、野外去捕获到五百多只野鸭、野鸡、野兔、水鸟等，这天分别把这些飞禽和野兔的肉拿到集市上出售，把皮毛出售给国营收购站，卖来的钱作为小队的副业收入。
    在集市中，还有多种多样的小摊和修补业。每天早上六点钟左右他们就开始了工作，直到下午五时还在接待着顾客。在街上横亘运河的大桥旁边，流动修理雨伞胶鞋的王阿才和他的妻子两人，正在接待一位社员修理伞骨。集市广场上的人们，带来的产品一经售完，走几步路就可以买到一般需要的小生产资料和生活日用品，还有冒着热气的豆腐，鲜红透亮的腐乳等等。
    早上七点钟左右，这一天的集市最热闹的时候过去了。公社社员们出售了他们带来的产品，换回了生产队、小队或家庭所需要的生产和生活用品，满意地离开集市，踏上归途，急于投入这一天的生产劳动。
    塘栖镇位于杭州市郊钱塘联社和德清县交界的地方，属杭州市。镇四周，是一望无际的水稻田，成片的桑园，河港池塘养殖着鱼类，塘栖枇杷闻名全国，还有络麻、湖羊等产品。公社化以后，这个地区更加富庶了。塘栖公社仅粮食一项，今年就比1957年增产29％；同一时期，猪和羊的头数分别增加27.9％和13.9％。另一方面，生产队、生产小队和社员家庭，不断地发展着副业生产。社员们利用自己的自留地和屋前屋后土地，种植着各种各样的东西。这样，社员收入大大增加。据统计，今年每户收入平均比去年增加一百四十多元。由于丰收和副业的发展，塘栖镇的集市越来越热闹起来了。社员们利用这个形式，互通有无，同时也使之更能对繁荣农村经济和促进生产起着作用。
