    Poland Expands Area for Sowing Fodder
    Poland is expanding the area for sowing fodder and establishing fodder production bases. This year, the national maize planting area reached 130,000 hectares, more than three times that of last year. Various regions have also expanded the irrigated area of pastures, resulting in a bumper harvest of autumn grass, clover, and alfalfa. It is estimated that the national green fodder production this year will increase by 12.5 million tons compared with last year, an increase of 20 percent. The production of beet leaves for silage increased by 50 percent. These green fodders can save the country about 600,000 tons of feed grain. In order to improve fodder supply and gradually achieve the task of self-sufficiency in agricultural production, the Polish agricultural departments have decided to change the composition of crop planting areas, reduce the planting area of ​​rye, oats, and potatoes, and expand the planting area of ​​high-quality and high-yield wheat to increase grain production; at the same time, greatly expand the planting area of ​​forage crops and establish fodder production bases. The state has decided to supply 15,000 tons of maize seeds to ensure that the maize sowing area reaches 250,000 hectares next year.

    波兰扩大饲料播种面积
    波兰正在扩大饲料播种面积，建立饲料生产基地。今年全国玉蜀黍种植面积达十三万公顷，比去年增加了两倍多。各地也扩大了牧场的灌溉面积，使秋草、三叶草、苜蓿获得丰收。估计今年全国的绿饲料比去年增产一千二百五十万吨，增加了百分之二十。作为青贮饲料的甜菜叶子增产了百分之五十。这些绿饲料可使国家节约六十万吨左右饲料粮食。为了改善饲料供应，逐步实现农业生产自给自足的任务，波兰农业部门决定改变农作物种植面积的构成，减少裸麦、燕麦、土豆的种植面积，扩大优种高产的小麦的种植面积，以增加粮食产量；同时大量扩大饲料作物的种植面积，建立饲料生产基地。国家已决定供应一万五千吨玉蜀黍种籽以保证明年的玉蜀黍播种面积达到二十五万公顷。
