Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, December 29th. The Exhibition of Achievements in China's Economic Construction opened here on the afternoon of the 28th. President Sékou Touré of the Republic of Guinea and Speaker of the National Assembly Diallo Saifoulaye attended the opening ceremony. President Touré cut the ribbon for the opening ceremony and delivered a speech.

Also attending the opening ceremony were Guinean government ministers, all members of the Political Bureau of the Guinean Democratic Party, people from all walks of life in Guinea, and more than 10,000 members of the public. Representatives of African countries stationed in Guinea and other foreign envoys in Conakry also attended the opening ceremony.

Chinese Ambassador to Guinea Ke Hua spoke first at the opening ceremony. He said that the common destiny of the people of China and Guinea closely links us together. The people of the two countries have always cared for and supported each other. Since establishing diplomatic relations, the friendship and cooperation between the people of the two countries has developed rapidly.

He said that recently, President Sékou Touré and the Guinean government delegation he led visited China, bringing the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Guinea to a new stage. He hoped that through this exhibition, the two countries could exchange experiences in economic construction to help achieve common economic prosperity; and he firmly believed that this exhibition would further strengthen the friendship between the people of China and Guinea.

Ambassador Ke Hua concluded by praising the outstanding achievements of the Guinean people in their persistent struggle to defend national independence and strive for national economic development in the short span of just over two years since independence.

In his speech, President Sékou Touré pointed out, "This exhibition not only symbolizes the nature of the existing relations between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Guinea, but also demonstrates the importance the two countries attach to economic construction in achieving the supreme goal of completely liberating the people of both countries."

After strongly condemning the imperialists for creating discord in Sino-Guinean relations, President Touré pointed out: "For us, it is a source of pride to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China first. We find that the basis of this relationship is in line with the conditions required by our people—respect for our national character and independence, and the will to engage in faithful cooperation for the benefit of the countries establishing relations; this is also a source of pride."

He said: "We have had the opportunity to personally witness the reality of the People's Republic of China. We have seen a determined people, a conscious people, and we have seen a united people. We have seen a people who, whether dealing with the freedom of all other peoples, international cooperation, or the defense of peace, constantly express their deep willingness to contribute to the success of these ideals, which are also our ideals."

He reiterated his support for the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations, and pointed out, "If the United Nations, under the influence of those who do not respect the true equality of all peoples, the true equality between all countries, and human justice, fails to fulfill its responsibility to admit the representatives of 650 million Chinese people into its organization, we believe that the will and awakening of the masses on all continents will force people to accept this justice and give China its place."

He concluded by shouting: Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live the fraternal cooperation and friendship between Guinea and China! Long live international peace and the progress of the people of all countries in the world!

After the ribbon-cutting ceremony, President Sékou Touré, Speaker Diallo Saifoulaye, and other guests visited the exhibition accompanied by Ambassador Ke Hua and delegation leader Li Ruizheng. After the visit, Sékou Touré and Diallo Saifoulaye wrote in the guestbook: "We are very satisfied with the achievements made by the Chinese people in national economic construction as demonstrated by the exhibition. In the name of the Republic of Guinea, I express the warm confidence and complete trust of all the Guinean people in the brilliant future of the great People's Republic of China. The democratic progress and peaceful will of the People's Republic of China are a reliable guarantee of the positive nature of the diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties established between the people of Guinea and China."

On the evening of the 28th, more than 20,000 people visited the exhibition.

    中国经济建设成就展览会在几内亚开幕
    柯华大使赞扬几内亚人民发展民族经济的出色成就
    杜尔总统说几内亚人民对中几两国的关系感到骄傲
    新华社科纳克里29日电　中华人民共和国经济建设成就展览会28日下午在这里开幕。几内亚共和国总统塞古·杜尔和国民议会议长迪阿洛·塞福拉耶参加了开幕仪式。杜尔总统为开幕仪式剪彩，并讲了话。
    参加开幕式的还有几内亚政府各部部长，几内亚民主党政治局全体委员和几内亚各界人士和群众一万多人。非洲国家驻几内亚的代表及其他外国驻科纳克里的使节们也参加了开幕式。
    中国驻几内亚大使柯华首先在开幕仪式上讲话，他说，中国和几内亚两国人民的共同命运把我们紧密地联结在一起。两国人民始终互相关怀、互相支持。在两国建立了外交关系之后，两国人民之间的友谊和合作有了迅速的发展。
    他说，不久前，塞古·杜尔总统和他所率领的几内亚共和国政府代表团对中国的访问，使中几两国的友好和合作关系进入一个新阶段。他希望，通过这个展览会，能交流两国经济建设的经验，以有助于两国经济的共同繁荣；并且深信，这个展览会将使中几两国人民之间的友谊得到进一步地加强。
    柯华大使最后对几内亚人民在独立后短短的两年多时间内，坚持不懈地为保卫民族独立，争取民族经济发展而进行斗争所获得的出色成就表示赞扬。
    塞古·杜尔总统在讲话中指出，“这个展览会不仅象征着中华人民共和国和几内亚共和国两国之间现存的关系的性质，而且也表明两国在实现彻底解放两国人民的最高目的中对经济建设所给予的地位”。
    杜尔总统在强烈谴责帝国主义者为在中—几关系中制造不和的谬论之后指出：“对我们来说，首先同中华人民共和国建立外交关系是一种骄傲。我们发现这种关系的基础正符合我国人民所要求的条件——尊重我国的国格和独立和为了建交国的利益而进行忠实合作的意志，这也是一种骄傲”。
    他说：“我们曾经有机会特别接触中华人民共和国的现实情况。我们看到了坚决的人民，有觉悟的人民，我们看到了团结的人民。我们看到了不论是对待所有其他各国人民的自由问题或者是国际合作和保卫和平问题，都不断向我们表示他们深刻地愿为这些也是我们的理想的成功而作出贡献的人民。”
    他重申支持恢复中国在联合国的合法席位，并指出，“如果联合国在那些不尊重各国人民真正平等、各国之间真正平等和人类正义的人的影响下，没有尽到责任接纳六亿五千万中国人的代表加入它的组织，我们相信，所有大陆的群众的意志和觉醒将迫使人们接受这种正义，让中国有它的位置”。
    他最后高呼：中华人民共和国万岁！几—中兄弟般的合作和友谊万岁！国际和平和世界各国人民进步万岁！
    在剪彩之后，塞古·杜尔总统、迪阿洛·塞福拉耶议长和其他来宾在柯华大使及李瑞征团长陪同下参观了展览会。参观以后，塞古·杜尔和迪阿洛·塞福拉耶在留言簿上写道：“对于展览会所表明的、中国人民在国家经济建设中所取得的成就，感到非常满意。我以几内亚共和国的名义，表达全体几内亚人民对伟大的中华人民共和国的光辉前途的热烈信心和完全的信任。中华人民共和国的民主进步和和平的意志，是几中两国人民之间所建立起来的外交、经济和文化联系中的积极性质的可靠保证”。
    28日晚上，有二万多人参观了这个展览会。
