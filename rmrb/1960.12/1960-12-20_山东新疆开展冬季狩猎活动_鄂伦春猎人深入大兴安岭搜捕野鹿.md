Xinhua News Agency, Jinan -- Since the beginning of winter, Shandong province has been widely engaged in fishing and hunting activities. Preliminary statistics up to the beginning of December show that Yantai area has caught 4,510,000 jin of fish and hunted more than 115,000 wild animals; Jining area has hunted more than 140,000 jin of wild ducks; and Linyi area has hunted more than 570,000 jin of wild rabbits, foxes, etc.

This province-wide fishing and hunting campaign has been conducted in an organized and planned manner under the leadership of Party committees at all levels. The coastal Qingdao and Yantai areas mainly engage in fishing production, and also organize commune members to "catch small sea creatures," gathering various aquatic plants and animals on the beaches, with great harvests. The people's communes and production teams in Weishan County have specially organized fishing teams and gun teams, totaling more than 3,800 people, equipped with fishing boats, duck guns, and duck nets, to enter Weishan Lake. By the beginning of December, they had caught more than 670,000 jin of fish and hunted more than 140,000 jin of wild ducks. Activities to hunt various wild animals have also been widely carried out in mountainous and plain areas. Since the beginning of winter, communes in some mountainous areas such as Moshan and Luoshan in Zhaoyuan County, Yantai Prefecture, have hunted more than 10,000 wild rabbits; 191 hunting groups in Liangshan County, Heze Prefecture, hunted 3,757 wild rabbits, 220 weasels, and 14 badgers and foxes in five days. In the spirit of relying on the sea for a living, relying on water for a living, and relying on the mountains for a living, all regions, from coastal to inland areas, from the ocean to lakes and rivers, and from mountainous to plain areas, have carried out mass fishing and hunting activities in accordance with local conditions.

Throughout the province, the propaganda work has been strengthened, leading bodies have been widely established, various professional teams have been organized, and labor has been rationally arranged, so that professional fishing and hunting are combined with mass part-time fishing and hunting, and collective fishing and hunting are combined with decentralized fishing and hunting, giving full play to the role of human and material resources. The principle of distribution according to labor has been conscientiously implemented for the income from fishing and hunting production, which has greatly boosted the production enthusiasm of commune members and promoted the rapid development of fishing and hunting activities.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi -- Xinjiang is seizing the peak season of winter hunting and organizing forces to carry out hunting activities. Currently, hunters are galloping across snowy mountains, grasslands, and vast Gobi deserts, hunting elk, argali sheep, wild boars, and wildfowl. At the foot of the Kunlun Mountains and the Pamir Plateau, Kirgiz herdsmen and Tajik herdsmen are setting traps and installing a large number of snares and iron frames everywhere to capture snow chickens. People's communes in various pastoral areas organize hunting groups by production team to ensure livestock protection, eliminate pests, increase income, and improve living standards. By the end of November, Hami Prefecture had killed 277 wolves.

Hunting has always been an important part of Xinjiang's winter sideline production. This year, before winter arrived, arrangements were made for hunting, with experienced hunters as the mainstay, appropriately matched with labor, and equipment was prepared. In Suiding County, each of the county's more than 100 production teams has one to two fixed hunters. The excellent hunters of the rocket people's communes in Nilka County hunted 3,359 wild animals in more than a month.

According to statistics from the autonomous region's purchasing departments, as of December 10, the region's purchases of major wild animal furs such as wild rabbits, wild sheep, and foxes have increased compared with the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot -- The hunting season has arrived, and more than 190 Oroqen hunters of the Oroqen Autonomous Banner, carrying guns and riding horses, have begun their winter hunting life in the snow-covered forests of the Greater Khingan Mountains, braving the severe cold of minus thirty degrees Celsius. According to experienced old hunters, the snow this winter is later, not too much or too little, which is very beneficial to hunting production.

Since the beginning of winter, the hunters have actively responded to the Party's call to "both raise and hunt," capturing wild deer and elk. Many traps, salt licks, and corrals have been set up in places where deer and elk often appear; in addition, 40 brave and resourceful young hunters and experienced old hunters have been selected to form commando teams, divided into 17 groups, to search for deer and elk tracks day and night, spurring their horses to track and hunt until they are captured.

In the first 11 months of this year, the Oroqen Autonomous Banner achieved a bumper harvest in hunting production, capturing 44 live deer, 5 elk, and 1 fox; killing more than 40 deer, and more than 3,600 bears, elk, musk rats, roe deer, musk deer, lynx, wild boars, gray rats and other beasts, and thousands of hazel grouse, pheasants and other birds.

The autonomous banner has established three deer farms, raising 50 deer, all of which are healthy and have given birth to two fawns.

    山东新疆开展冬季狩猎活动
    鄂伦春猎人深入大兴安岭搜捕野鹿
    新华社济南讯　山东各地入冬以来普遍开展捕捞、打猎活动。到12月初的初步统计，烟台地区已捕鱼四百五十一万斤，打野兽十一万五千多只；济宁地区打野鸭十四万多斤；临沂地区打野兔、狐狸等五十七万多斤。
    这次全省各地的捕捞打猎活动，是在各级党委领导下有组织有计划地进行的。沿海的青岛、烟台地区主要开展捕捞生产，并组织社员“赶小海”，到海滩去拣捞各种水生动植物，收获很大。微山县的各人民公社和生产队专门组织渔队、枪队，共三千八百多人，备有渔船、鸭枪、鸭网，进入微山湖，到12月初已捕鱼六十七万多斤，打野鸭十四万多斤。各山区平原地带猎取各种野兽的活动也普遍开展起来。烟台专区招远县磨山、罗山等一部分山区的公社，入冬以来已打野兔一万多只；菏泽专区梁山县一百九十一个打猎组，五天内就打野兔三千七百五十七只，黄鼠狼二百二十只，獾、狐十四只。各地区本着靠海吃海、靠水吃水、靠山吃山的精神，从沿海到内地、从海洋到湖河，从山区到平原，都因地制宜地开展了群众性的渔猎活动。
    全省各地在开展捕捞打猎活动中，都加强了宣传工作，普遍建立了领导机构，组织了各种专业队伍，合理安排劳力，使专业捕打与群众性抽空捕打、集体捕打与分散捕打互相结合，充分发挥人力、物力的作用。对于渔猎生产的收益，认真贯彻了按劳分配的原则，大大鼓舞了社员群众的生产积极性，推动了捕打活动的迅速开展。
    新华社乌鲁木齐讯　新疆各地正抓紧冬季打猎盛季，组织力量开展狩猎活动。目前，猎手们正驰骋在雪山、草原和千里戈壁上，猎取麋鹿、大头羊、野猪和野禽。在昆仑山麓和帕米尔高原，柯尔克孜族牧民和塔吉克牧民到处安下陷井、安上大批套索、铁架，捕获雪鸡。广大牧区各人民公社都以生产队为单位组织打猎小组，作到保畜除害、增加收入，改善生活。哈密专区到11月底已打死害狼二百七十七只。
    狩猎一直是新疆冬季副业生产的重要内容之一。今年各地在冬季没到之前，就对打猎作了安排，以有经验的猎手为主，适当搭配了劳力，并准备了器械。绥定县全县一百多个生产小队，队队都固定了一至二名猎手。尼勒克县火箭人民公社各生产队的优秀猎手，在一个多月内就猎获野生动物三千三百五十九只。
    据自治区收购部门统计，截至12月10日止全区收购的野兔、野羊、狐狸等主要野生动物毛皮，都比去年同期增加。
    新华社呼和浩特讯　狩猎旺季已经到来，鄂伦春自治旗一百九十多名鄂伦春猎人携枪跨马，在风雪弥漫的大兴安岭森林中，冒着零下三十多度的严寒，开始冬季的狩猎生活。据有经验的老猎人判断，今冬雪下得比往年晚，不大不小，对猎业生产十分有利。
    入冬以来，猎人们积极响应党的“养猎并举”号召，捕捉野鹿和犴。在鹿和犴时常出没的地方设置了许多陷井、盐池和栏圈；还选拔出四十名勇敢机智的青年猎人和经验丰富的老猎人成立突击队，分成十七个小组，日夜寻找鹿和犴的蹄印，策马跟踪追捕，直到捕获为止。
    今年头11个月，鄂伦春自治旗猎业生产获得丰收，共活捉鹿四十四只、犴五头和狐狸一只；打死四十多只鹿、三千六百多头熊、犴、香鼠、狍、麝、猞猁、野猪、灰鼠等走兽，和数千只飞龙、野雉等飞禽。
    自治旗已建立起三个养鹿场，饲养了五十只鹿，现在都很健壮，已生下两只仔鹿。
