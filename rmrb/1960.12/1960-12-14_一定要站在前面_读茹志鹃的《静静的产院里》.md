    "Must Stand at the Front"
    ——Reading Ru Zhijuan's "Quiet Delivery Room"
    Bing Xin
    In the ranks of young writers, Ru Zhijuan has emerged, and as a female reader, my heart is filled with great joy and gratitude.

    Since Liberation, China has undergone earth-shattering changes. Society is changing, people are changing, especially women, whose spiritual outlook has changed beyond description! In our reports and novels, we have written about countless female labor heroes and advanced models. These reports and the female images in the novels can also move and educate people, but from a woman's perspective, the psychological depiction of women always feels somewhat lacking in subtlety and depth. There doesn't seem to be a very deep familiarity and understanding of women, and the image of brightness always seems to be veiled behind a thin layer of gauze, not so clear-eyed and radiant.

    Ru Zhijuan observes, studies, and analyzes Chinese women before and after Liberation from the perspective of a new woman in new China. She grasps the strong and distinct revolutionary and combative nature of the story, and she does not let go of every moving, subtle, and profound detail in her observations. And each of these moving, subtle, and profound details, especially about women, seems to a female reader to be something that only a female writer can write so deeply and so movingly!

    Here, I will only bring up her short story "Quiet Delivery Room" ("People's Literature," June 1960 issue) to talk about my feelings.

    This "Quiet Delivery Room" is not quiet; like the raging wind of the night the story takes place in, in the turbulent and leaping environment, everyone—inside and outside the delivery room—feels as if "the wind is using a huge, invisible force to push her from behind, embrace her, and force her to move forward as if her feet are not touching the ground."

    Aunt Tan, the protagonist of the story, is a widow who has been widowed since she was thirty-nine years old. She has seen women giving birth as if they were passing through a "gate," "the parturient biting her hair and sitting on the edge of the footbath to give birth." And when her own daughter-in-law gave birth, the placenta was stepped on by the midwife. In 1956, during the primary cooperative, the head of the cooperative, who is now Secretary Du of the commune, asked her to go to the town hospital to learn new methods of midwifery, telling her that this was also a revolution, a struggle against feudal and backward forces.

    Aunt Tan learned the new method of midwifery and started working. On the one hand, she constantly fought against old ideas and habits, and old midwives. On the other hand, she was also discouraged, shed tears, and complained to Secretary Du. Secretary Du advised her:

    "Old sister-in-law, the task of our generation is not simple! Society is going to change several times in our hands. The situation is developing so fast, how can there be fewer old ideas and old habits of all kinds? So, our work is called doing revolution, and our learning is also called doing revolution. What we don't know, we have to learn quickly, and what we don't understand, we have to understand quickly."

    Aunt Tan stopped being picky. After the establishment of the commune, a "Quiet Delivery Room" was organized. Here, there are delivery beds, electric lights, snow-white walls, and all the necessary midwifery equipment...and she, this "obstetrician"—this was the title she quietly added to her position when she couldn't think of an appropriate name to call her job.

    In the two years since the delivery room was established, a total of 356 babies have been delivered. Many risks have passed, and Aunt Tan has gained the love of the mothers in the commune. Aunt Tan feels proud and happy. This quiet delivery room of hers makes her happy and cheerful. Of course, there are also cases where women do not have smooth deliveries, but as long as you call the real obstetrician in the town hospital, the problem is solved. "Here can't be compared with those big hospitals in the city." Aunt Tan began to be satisfied with her current situation and began to dislike new things, such as electric lights, which were bright but too expensive. As for the postpartum exercises, she couldn't learn to clap her hands and stomp her feet like the women, so she didn't like them, and so on.

    But the leaping situation of one day equaling twenty years does not allow people to be content with the status quo; new things must be learned and understood quickly. He Mei, representing the new force, came in with eighty pounds of luggage, and turned on the electric light with a snap. Aunt Tan's first impression of this doctor, who had grown up watching her and had returned from training in the city, was:

    "How did this child know there was an electric light as soon as she entered the door? Even if she knew, how did she know where the switch was? It's as if there was an electric light in the delivery room, and there should be an electric light, and having an electric light is a matter of course." Aunt Tan was strange at first, and then felt a little out of place.

    This "old stickler," He Mei, is busy asking this and that, installing a water pipe, and getting the mothers to do postpartum exercises. The mothers also agreed, and the mothers' room was filled with laughter.

    "The originally quiet delivery room now seems to have a gust of wind rushing in, disrupting everything." Aunt Tan quickly walked out of this quiet delivery room, her mind empty and full. She just felt unhappy, but couldn't say why. Maybe she was just getting older and more dissatisfied. She began to convince herself...

    She sees contentment in life and backwardness in work as one and the same thing.

    At this time, another woman who was backward three years ago, the old midwife Grandma Pan, gave her a big stimulus.

    Grandma Pan works in the chicken farm, and she is wholeheartedly moving forward. In order to let the chickens eat a little meat, she bends over and catches frogs by the water...Turning back to talk to Aunt Tan, her face looks kind and intelligent, and her eyes are also bright.

    "Revolution is really amazing! Society has changed, and people have changed." Aunt Tan looked at Grandma Pan and thought of Secretary Du's words again.

    Aunt Tan saw the red arrow on Grandma Pan's name on the chicken farm's competition chart, pointing the highest. This is the backward person who stomped her feet and complained to her three years ago, and now she looks so radiant and young in front of her! A person is forever young and forever happy in constant revolution and constant progress. Aunt Tan deeply realized Grandma Pan's pain three years ago, "That was her panic, but she refused to admit that she was behind the times."

    "Could it be that I am like Grandma Pan three years ago..." At this time, the strong wind outside the door and the strong wind in her heart blew together. The warm greetings from the mothers she had received on the roadside cotton field just now, and the pride and happiness she felt herself, were all things of the past, and were blown away by this gust of wind!

    This "invisible storm swept in, as if a滔天巨浪 (overwhelming wave) rushed forward, they advanced with magnificent momentum, overwhelming the mountains and overturning the seas," but the respectable and lovable Aunt Tan did not let this gust of wind blow her down. She clearly felt that the days she was living now were different day by day, one day was like another, she was uneasy, she was dissatisfied with herself, she refused to fall behind, she hurried back to the hospital, just in time for the delivery of the parturient Cai Di.

    Like a veteran who has experienced hundreds of battles, she waits "at her fighting post, with the trust of the parturient women, waiting for that joyful and tense moment."

    The author intersperses a very delicate description here.

    He Mei is stroking the parturient, and the three are talking lively, talking about the issue of being born late and having great happiness. The parturient Cai Di said:

    "If you want to talk about being born at a good time, then the second child is better than the first child, the first child is better than He Mei, and He Mei is better than you, Aunt Tan, do you think that's right?"

    He Mei massaged Cai Di, and felt a little uneasy in her heart. She quickly glanced at Aunt Tan, but Aunt Tan didn't care...

    He Mei is not the protagonist in this novel, but she is the first gust of wind that broke the tranquility of this delivery room. Her personality is straightforward, lively, and serious, completely a big girl of the new society, but she also has her delicate and tender side. She was afraid that Cai Di's words "He Mei is better than Aunt Tan" would hurt Aunt Tan's heart, and she couldn't help feeling uneasy in her heart, and quickly glanced at Aunt Tan.

    And Aunt Tan didn't care at the time. When she was full of confidence "waiting for that joyful and tense moment," the test came! The parturient is yawning and wants to sleep. If the baby is not taken out quickly with forceps, it may suffocate! She almost instinctively stood up abruptly, "I'll call!" Again, she called the doctor in the city. She had lost her confidence. She didn't believe in herself, and she didn't believe in He Mei. Only in the strong wind did she hear Secretary Du's firm voice broadcasting to the commune members, and she was enlightened. She remembered what Secretary Du had told her, and remembered that the situation was developing so fast, and remembered that He Mei was the commune's doctor. She turned around and ran back almost with the wind, and saw He Mei preparing for a battle, walking back and forth solemnly. She then remembered Cai Di's words.

    The word "revolution" released a dazzling light in Aunt Tan's heart: "No! Those born early should stand at the front, must stand at the front. I can learn, Secretary Du, I want to learn, I want to do revolution..." Aunt Tan straightened her body and walked towards He Mei. She felt that her legs were trembling again like the first time she delivered a baby.

    "He Mei, let me learn!"

    He Mei looked up and saw Aunt Tan standing in front of her timidly, but so bravely and resolutely. In that instant, He Mei almost remembered the entire history of this delivery room...

    She also remembered how proudly and preciously Aunt Tan flipped that electric light switch...

    This is the climax of this novel. After that, naturally "everything is as ideal." Aunt Tan is working selflessly and nervously, and only sees the gestures He Mei is pointing to her, and only hears Secretary Du's resolute and loud voice... Suddenly, "Wow!" the baby cried... Aunt Tan just straightened up and was hugged by He Mei, who was filled with tears of emotion.

    Which moved reader would not want to hug this "revolutionary to the end" Aunt Tan tightly?

    This short story has a rigorous structure, without a single wasted stroke. The time is only one day and night, and the characters on stage are only Aunt Tan, He Mei, Grandma Pan, Cai Di, and two other parturients, one is the captain of the豐产田 (bumper harvest field), an advanced producer - A Ling, and the other does not even have a name. The words, actions, and psychological activities of the above-mentioned female characters are all very well-proportioned in their detailed and brief pairings. For example, Grandma Pan is only on stage for a moment, but everything about her past is vividly and vividly described in Aunt Tan's memories and excitement. Regarding He Mei, there is not much material in Aunt Tan's memories. She is just a "second girl" sent to the city for training. Therefore, He Mei's character is portrayed in her own activities and conversations with Aunt Tan. The only male supporting character on stage is Cai Di's husband, one of the first batch of drivers trained by the commune, a young and lovely "daredevil." Another extremely important male supporting character, almost the soul of this story, is the commune's Secretary Du, whom Aunt Tan trusts the most and guarantees to in her heart. We did not see his demeanor, but only heard his voice. How firm, how loud, how optimistic this voice is. This voice forever echoes in Aunt Tan's ears, in the ears of all commune members, just as the beginning of the last paragraph of the story says: "The strong wind seemed to be subdued by Secretary Du's firm and loud voice. It began to shrink back, and the night returned to its tranquil state." The bright and correct voice of the Party forever echoes loudly on the vast and broad land of our motherland. The night symbolizes Aunt Tan, and also symbolizes all those who are content with the status quo, who only feel proud and happy, and who are being pushed by the strong wind of the times. Only by listening to the Party's words, meeting the challenge, and standing at the front can they restore "a tranquil state"!

    This night's strong wind is indispensable. The strong wind sets off Aunt Tan's uneasy heart, making it even more tense. The strong wind makes everything around the delivery room active, setting out a火剌剌 (fiery) posture of "gongs and drums sounding in unison":

    The wind outside is getting stronger and stronger, and the loudspeakers in the fields and villages are all ringing at the same time, and the voice of Secretary Du of the commune is speaking...All the machinery and personnel of the commune are mobilized. The sound of cars, the sound of encouraging slogans in the broadcast, are sometimes blown into the delivery room by the wind, and sometimes carried far away by the wind...

    The darkness is so thick, the wind is rushing around, and Secretary Du's clear voice in the loudspeaker is ringing, in the fields, on the roofs, in the villages, on the roads, his loud and firm voice is echoing...The loud broadcast in the strong wind, although it is sometimes near and sometimes far, makes Aunt Tan's uneasy and turbulent heart grab a擎天柱子 (sky-supporting pillar)! It makes her become a member of the revolutionary masses under the encouragement of loud slogans.

    As I said before, the women under Ru Zhijuan's pen, old and young, are all so distinct and so lovable. Now I only mention the women of the same age as Aunt Tan that the author has described in the past, such as the protagonist in "Aunt Guan," Zhao Er Ma in "Sisters-in-law," Aunt He in "As You Wish," Aunt Wang in "By the Side of the Sports Ground"...etc., their psychological activities are significantly different from Aunt Tan's. After Liberation, society changed, they thoroughly turned themselves over, they were happy, they were grateful, they felt happy, like Aunt He in "As You Wish," who was also proud with tears in her eyes because she "earned a salary for the first time at the age of almost fifty." In the future, they may gradually become like Aunt Tan in "Quiet Delivery Room," content, quiet, and regard satisfaction in life and backwardness in work as one and the same thing.

    The author is leaping forward with the era of the Great Leap Forward. She uses a leaping perspective to find female images in the Leap Forward. She stirs up a strong wind around a "Quiet Delivery Room." This strong wind makes Aunt Tan and all readers' hearts experience unprecedented turbulence! This strong wind spreads the Party's firm and loud voice of "continuous revolution" and "revolution to the end," encouraging all those who are content with the status quo and want to chew on feelings of happiness and pride in a quiet corner to rise up and catch up, "must stand at the front"!

    I repeat once more, in the ranks of young writers, there has emerged a Ru Zhijuan, and as a female reader, my joy and gratitude are great.

    “一定要站在前面”
    ——读茹志鹃的《静静的产院里》
    冰心
    在年轻作家的队伍里，出了一个茹志鹃，作为一个女读者，我心里的喜欢和感激是很大的。
    解放后，中国来了一个翻天复地的变化。社会在变，人在变，尤其在妇女方面，精神面貌的变化，大到无可形容！在我们的报道里，小说里，不知写过多少妇女劳动英雄、先进模范的事迹。这些报道和小说里的妇女形象，也都能感动人，教育人，但是从一个妇女来看关于妇女的心理描写，总觉得还有些地方，不够细腻，不够深刻，对于妇女还不是有很深的熟悉和了解，光明的形象总像是蒙在薄薄的一层云纱后面，不是那么眉宇清扬，容光焕发。
    茹志鹃是以一个新中国的新妇女的观点，来观察、研究、分析解放前后的中国妇女的。她抓住了故事里强烈而鲜明的革命性和战斗性，也不放过她观察里的每一个动人的细腻和深刻的细节，而这每一个动人的细腻和深刻的细节，特别是关于妇女的，从一个女读者看来，仿佛是只有女作家才能写得如此深入，如此动人！
    在这里，我只提出她的短篇小说《静静的产院里》（《人民文学》1960年6月号）来谈一谈我的感受。
    这个《静静的产院里》并不宁静，它和故事发生的这一夜的狂风一样，在动荡跃进的环境中，每一个人——在产院里面和外面的——都像觉得“风用一种巨大的、看不见的力量，在后推着她，拥着她，迫使她好像是脚不沾地的在向前走”。
    谭婶婶，故事里的主人翁，是一个从三十九岁就当寡妇，看到过女人生孩子就像过一次“关”，“产妇咬着头发，坐在脚盆边上生孩子”，而她自己的媳妇生孩子，胎胞就是给产婆拿脚踩下来的，在1956年初级社的时候，社长、也就是现在公社的杜书记，要她到镇上医院去学习新法接生，告诉她这也是革命，是跟封建落后势力作斗争。
    谭婶婶学会了新法接生，开始工作，一方面不断地和旧思想习惯，和旧的接生婆展开了斗争。另一方面，她也灰过心，流过泪，向杜书记诉过苦，杜书记劝过她：
    “老嫂子，我们这一辈的任务是不简单哪！社会要在我们手里变几变，形势发展这样快，各种各样的旧思想旧习惯还会少得了？所以我们做工作就叫做干革命，我们学习也叫做干革命。不会的得赶紧学会，不懂的就得赶紧学懂。”
    谭婶婶不挑剔了。公社成立后，组织了一个“静静的产院”，在这里有产床，有电灯，有雪白的墙壁，有助产的一切用具……还有她这一位“产科医生”——这是她在想不出一个恰当的名字来称呼自己的职务的时候，悄悄地对自己加上的封号。
    产院成立的两年里，一共接了三百五十六个宝宝，多少风险都过去了，谭婶婶得到了公社里母亲们的爱戴。谭婶婶觉得自豪，觉得幸福，她的这个静静的产院，使得她愉快开朗。当然也有产妇不顺产的情况，但是只要打电话到镇里医院去请真正的产科医生，问题就解决了。“这里不能和城里那些大医院比”。谭婶婶开始满足于自己的现状，开始看不惯新的东西了，比如电灯，亮是亮，就是太费了。至于产妇做操，女人家拍手顿脚的，她自己学不上来，也就不喜欢，如此等等。
    但是一天等于二十年的跃进形势，是不容人安于现状的，新事物就得赶紧学会，赶紧学懂。荷妹，代表着新生力量，热气腾腾地，扛着八十来斤的行李进来了，啪的一声就把电灯打开。谭婶婶对于这个从小看她长大、到城里培训回来的医生的第一个印象是：
    “这孩子一进门，怎么就知道有电灯，即使知道，那她又怎么晓得开关在那里？好像产院里本来有电灯，应该有电灯，有电灯是理所当然的事情，谭婶婶开始是奇怪，随后就觉得有些不大入味。”
    这个“老扎认真”的二丫头，也就是荷妹，一会儿都不闲着地问这个，问那个，做自来水管，把产妇掇弄起来做产后操，偏偏产妇也赞成，产妇屋里嘻嘻哈哈笑成一片。
    “本来安安静静的产院，现在好像有一股什么风闯了进来，把一切都搅乱了。”谭婶婶迅速地走出这静静的产院，脑子里空空地，又是满满的，她只觉得不开心，又说不出为什么。大概是自己越老越不知足了。她开始说服自己……
    她把生活上的知足和工作上的落后，看成是一个东西。
    这时，另一个三年前落后的妇女，旧产婆潘奶奶，给了她一个很大的刺激。
    潘奶奶在鸡场里工作，一心一意地向前赶，为着让鸡吃一点荤腥，她弯腰哈背地在水边捉青蛙……回过头来和谭婶婶说话，脸上显得又和善又聪明，眼睛也有神了。
    “革命，真是了不起呵！社会变了样，人也变了样。”谭婶婶看着潘奶奶，又想起了杜书记的话。
    谭婶婶看见鸡场的竞赛表上，潘奶奶名字上的红色箭头，头昂昂地翘得最高。这就是三年前对她又跳脚又诉苦的落后人物，现在在她面前显得这样地光彩年轻！一个人在不断革命，不断进步里，是永远年轻永远快乐的。谭婶婶深深地体会到三年前潘奶奶的痛苦，“那是她恐慌，却又不肯承认自己落在时代的后面。”
    “难道，我现在就像三年前的潘奶奶……”这时，门外的大风和她心里的大风，一齐刮起了。刚才在路上棉田边所受到的母亲们的一阵子热烈的招呼，和她自己所感到的自豪和幸福，都是过去的事情，都被这一阵大风刮散了！
    这一阵“看不见的风暴席卷而来，仿佛滔天的巨浪向前扑来，它们气势磅礴，排山倒海的向前推，向前涌”，但是可敬可爱的谭婶婶，并没有让这阵大风吹倒下去，她清楚地感到：现在过的日子，是一天不同于一天，一天一个样子，她不安，她对自己不满，她不肯掉队，她急忙回到医院去，正赶上刚送来的产妇彩弟的生产。
    她像一个身经百战的老战士，带着产妇们的信赖，“在自己的战斗岗位上，守候那喜悦而又紧张的一刻”。
    作者在这里穿插了一段很细腻的描写。
    荷妹在给产妇抚摩着，三人在热闹地谈着话，谈到生得晚福气就大的问题，产妇彩弟说：
    “要说时辰生得好，那么老二比老大好，老大比荷妹好，荷妹又比你谭婶婶好，你说对不对？”
    荷妹给彩弟按摩着，心里微微不安起来了。她迅速的朝谭婶婶看了一眼，可是谭婶婶并没有在意……
    荷妹在这篇小说里，并不是主角，但是她是头一阵冲破这个产院的宁静的风。她的性格是爽朗、活泼、认真，完全是一个新社会的大姑娘，但是，她也有其细腻温存之处。她怕彩弟的“荷妹又比谭婶婶好”这一句话，会伤了谭婶婶的心，她自己心里忍不住不安起来，而迅速的朝谭婶婶看了一眼。
    而这句话，当时谭婶婶并没有在意，在她充满着自信的“守候那喜悦而又紧张的一刻”的时候，考验来了！产妇打哈欠要睡，婴儿若不赶紧用钳子取出，可能会闷死！她几乎是本能地霍地站起身，“我打电话去！”又是打电话请城里的医生，她没有了自信了，她不相信自己，也不相信荷妹，只在大风中听到杜书记对社员们广播的坚定的声音，她才得了启发，想起杜书记跟她说过的话，想起形势发展得这样快，想起荷妹就是公社的医生。她掉转头几乎是和风一齐飞奔回来，看见荷妹正在准备一场战斗，庄严地走来走去，她才想起彩弟的那一句话。
    “革命”两个字在谭婶婶心里放出了耀眼的光辉：“不！出世早，就该站在前面，一定要站在前面。可以学，杜书记，我要学，我要干革命。……”谭婶婶挺了挺身子，向荷妹走去，她觉得自己的腿又像第一次接生时候那样颤颤的。
    “荷妹，让我来学学吧！”
    荷妹抬头，见谭婶婶怯怯的，但又是那样勇敢，那样坚决的站在自己面前。在这一刹那中，荷妹几乎记起了这个产院的全部历史……
    她也想起了谭婶婶是那么自豪那么珍惜的扳动那电灯开关……
    这是这篇小说的最高峰，之后，自然“一切都如理想中一样”，谭婶婶在忘我地紧张地工作，眼中只看见荷妹给她指点的手势，耳畔只听见杜书记那坚决响亮的声音……忽然“哇”的一声，婴儿哭了……谭婶婶刚直起腰来，就被满含着感动的泪水的荷妹抱住了。
    哪一个被感动的读者，不想把这个“革命到底”的谭婶婶紧紧地抱住呢？
    这个短篇小说，结构是谨严的，没有一点废笔，时间只有一日夜，上场的人物，只有谭婶婶，荷妹，潘奶奶，彩弟，还有两个产妇，一个是丰产田的小队长、先进生产者——阿玲，另外一个连名字都没有。以上几个女角，她们的言谈，动作，心理活动，详略配搭得非常匀称。比如说，潘奶奶上场不过一刻，而她过去的一切，都在谭婶婶的回忆和激动中，鲜明生动地描述了出来。关于荷妹，谭婶婶的回忆中，没有多少材料，她只是一个送到城里培训的“二丫头”。因此荷妹的性格，就在她自己的活动和同谭婶婶的对话中描绘了出来。男配角上场的只有彩弟的丈夫，社里培养的第一批司机之一，年青可爱的“冒失鬼”，另外一个极其重要的男配角，几乎是这篇故事的灵魂，那是谭婶婶所最信赖的、在心里对他保证的、公社的杜书记。我们没有看到他的丰采，只听到他的声音，这声音是多么坚定，多么响亮，多么乐观。这声音永远在谭婶婶的耳中回荡，在全体社员的耳中回荡，正如故事最后一段开头所说的：“狂风似乎被杜书记那个坚定响亮的声音慑住了，它开始畏缩退却了，夜，又恢复了她恬静的常态”。党的英明正确的声音，永远响亮地在我们祖国辽阔广大的土地上回荡。夜，象征着谭婶婶，也象征着一切安于现状，只感到自豪感到幸福的，而又被时代的狂风所推涌着的人。他们只有听党的话，迎上前去，站在前面，才能恢复“恬静的常态”！
    这夜的狂风是不可少的，狂风衬托着谭婶婶的不安的心，更加紧张。狂风使得产院周围的一切，都活跃了起来，摆出“金鼓齐鸣”的火剌剌的架势：
    外面的风呜呜的越来越大了，田里、村头的广播喇叭一齐响了起来，公社杜书记的声音在说话……社里一切的机械、人员都出动了，汽车声，广播里的鼓动口号声，忽而被风吹进产院，忽而被风带得远远的……
    天黑得这样浓，这样厚，风在横冲直撞，广播喇叭里杜书记那清楚的声音在响着，在田野里，在屋顶上，在村头，在道旁，都有他那响亮的、坚定的声音在回响……狂风中的响亮的广播，尽管是忽远忽近，却使谭婶婶的不安动荡的心，抓到了一根擎天的柱子！使得她变成在响亮的口号的鼓动下的革命群众之一员。
    前面已经说过，茹志鹃笔下的妇女，老老少少，都是那么鲜明，那么可爱。如今只提作者以往描写的和谭婶婶一样年纪的妇女，像《关大妈》里的主人翁，《妯娌》里的赵二妈，《如愿》里的何大妈，《运动场边》的王大妈……等等，她们的心理活动和谭婶婶又有显著的不同。解放之后，社会变了，她们彻底地翻了身，她们欢喜，她们感激，她们感到幸福，像《如愿》里的何大妈，也为自己“快跨进五十的人了，竟然第一次挣得了薪水”，满眼含泪地感到自豪。以后，她们也许会渐渐地和《静静的产院》里的谭婶婶一样，知足，宁静，把生活上的满足，和工作上的落后当成一件东西。
    作者是和大跃进的时代一齐跃进的，她以跃进的眼光，来寻找跃进中的妇女形象，她在一座“静静的产院”的周围，刮起一阵大风，这一阵大风，使谭婶婶和一切读者的心中，都起了空前的动荡！这一阵大风，传播了党的“不断革命”，“革命到底”的坚定响亮的声音，鼓动一切安于现状，想在静静的角落里，咀嚼着幸福感自豪感的人们，奋起直追，“一定要站在前面”！
    我再重复一句，在年轻作家的队伍里，出了一个茹志鹃，作为一个女读者，我的喜欢和感激是很大的。
