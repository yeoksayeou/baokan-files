Xinhua News Agency, December 29th. Beijing Mayor Peng Zhen met this afternoon and hosted a banquet to welcome Havana Mayor José Lliunusa of Cuba, Cuban National Traffic Police Bureau Director Major Raúl Menéndez Tomasovich, Cuban Rebel Army Captain Anliki Gonzalez, Cuban Rebel Army Captain and Staff Officer Aiciliel Leiba, and Havana Deputy Mayor Jorge Garcia Bango.

Mayor Peng Zhen spoke at the banquet, first extending a warm welcome to the distinguished guests on behalf of the people of Beijing and the people of the whole country. He praised the firm and heroic spirit displayed by the Cuban people in their struggle to win national independence and oppose U.S. imperialism. He expressed his admiration and respect to the Cuban people, Prime Minister Castro, and other leaders through the distinguished guests.

He said that although China and Cuba are far apart, the struggle against U.S. imperialism and the progressive cause we are engaged in closely link us together.

Mayor Peng Zhen also pointed out that Cuba is located at the doorstep of U.S. imperialism, with a small country and a small population, but dares to fight against U.S. imperialism and has achieved victory. This not only supports the struggle of oppressed nations, oppressed people, and peace-loving people all over the world, but also sets up a banner and example of liberation for them.

Mayor José Lliunusa first expressed his gratitude to Mayor Peng Zhen for his warm hospitality in his speech.

He said that we have long hoped to visit China because in the past we had some understanding of the situation in this country during the war and after the victory.

Mayor Lliunusa also said that as time goes by, the people of our two countries are moving forward more and more, while imperialism is getting weaker and weaker. Because the truth belongs to us. No matter how imperialism spreads rumors, the Cuban people are united and are fighting for the interests of themselves and the people of the world.

He pointed out that we are pleased that the struggle of the Cuban people is not isolated, because we have China and other socialist countries as our friends.

He said that although we have different languages and are far apart, we have a common enemy and are carrying out a common struggle.

Mayor Lliunusa also said that the Cuban people are very happy and warmly welcome the agreement signed by Major Guevara with the Chinese government during his visit to China.

Cuban Ambassador to China Oscar Pino Santos and his wife, as well as other embassy officials, were also invited to the banquet.
