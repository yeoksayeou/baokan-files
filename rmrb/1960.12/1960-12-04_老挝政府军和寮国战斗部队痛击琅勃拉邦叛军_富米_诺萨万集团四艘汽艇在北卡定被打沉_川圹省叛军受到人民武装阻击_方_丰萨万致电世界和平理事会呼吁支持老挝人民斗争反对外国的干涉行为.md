The broadcast said that the armed forces of the Lao Combat Forces and the government army were divided into multiple routes to surround and attack Luang Prabang. On November 30, a team from the Lao Combat Forces and the government army launched an attack on North Shun (an important outpost 14 kilometers north of Luang Prabang), and a company of rebels fled in panic. On December 1, a company of rebel paratroopers reinforced strongholds such as Keowan, Thien Village, and Xiao Village, but under the attack of the Lao Combat Forces and the people's armed forces, the rebels collapsed and withdrew from the above three strongholds.

The broadcast said that currently, the armed forces of the Lao Combat Forces are tightly surrounding the city of Luang Prabang together with the government army.

The broadcast said that a portion of the rebels attacked by the Lao Combat Forces and the government army have scattered, and a portion have defected to the people's side and have been warmly received by the people. These soldiers are all happy to have escaped the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak treasonous group.

The broadcast said that the people in the Luang Prabang area warmly welcomed the victory of the Lao Combat Forces and the government army. In those places that have not yet been liberated, the people are waiting to cooperate with the Lao Combat Forces and the government army in order to drive away the rebel elements and liberate Luang Prabang.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 3rd - According to a broadcast today by the Lao Combat Forces Radio: On November 29th and 30th, the Royal Lao Government forces counterattacked the Phoumi Nosavan treasonous group in North Kading, killing and wounding many rebels. The government forces also sank four motorboats of the Phoumi Nosavan treasonous group.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 3rd - According to a broadcast today by the Lao Combat Forces Radio: In order to coordinate with the activities of the Royal Lao Government forces, the armed forces of the Lao Combat Forces and the people's armed forces launched an attack on the treasonous army entrenched in Xieng Khouang starting from November 22nd.

The broadcast said that the armed forces of the Lao Combat Forces encountered the rebels north of Hai Village and fought against the enemy forces "sweeping" the Nong Het area on November 23rd, defeating nearly two companies of rebels and killing and wounding more than twenty rebels. On November 23rd, another army of the Lao Combat Forces fought the rebels in Tan Tang Village and occupied the Phu Baka Na stronghold.

The broadcast said that the armed forces of the Lao Combat Forces also intercepted the rebels at Phu Pha on November 25th, killing and wounding nineteen rebels. In addition, when the armed forces of the Lao Combat Forces attacked the Na Kang area on November 22nd, they forced more than one hundred rebels to flee in panic and seized many military supplies.

The broadcast said that currently, the Lao Combat Forces are continuing to attack the rebels throughout Xieng Khouang province and are calling on them to rise up against the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak treasonous group and return to the embrace of the government and the people.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 3rd - According to a broadcast by the Lao Combat Forces Radio on the evening of December 2nd, Phoumi Vongvichit, Chairman of the Lao "Committee for Peaceful Neutrality, National Harmony, and Unified State," sent a telegram to the World Peace Council on November 29th, condemning imperialist interference in Lao internal affairs and calling on this organization to sympathize with and support the just struggle of the Lao people, oppose foreign interference in Lao internal affairs, and force the treasonous group to stop their actions in order to contribute to the defense of Lao independence and the cause of world peace.

The telegram said that in accordance with the current situation in Laos and the demands of the Lao people, and in accordance with the spirit of the Bandung Conference, the Lao "Committee for Peaceful Neutrality, National Harmony, and Unified State" has been established. Its executive committee includes representatives from the coup committee, youth organizations, various ethnic groups, people from all walks of life, and patriotic individuals, with the aim of uniting the people of the whole country, opposing foreign intervention and its lackey reactionary group, so that Laos can move towards a truly peaceful and neutral path and achieve national harmony and a unified state.

The telegram said that currently, some foreign countries are supporting the Phoumi-Boun Oum group, opposing the Souvanna Phouma legitimate government, and arbitrarily dividing Laos in order to establish their dictatorial system and create conditions for further foreign interference in Lao internal affairs. Facts have proved that foreign interveners and the treasonous group have trampled on the sovereignty of the Lao people, creating a tense situation in Laos.

In the telegram, Phoumi Vongvichit said that in the face of the current serious situation in Laos, he, on behalf of the "Committee for Peaceful Neutrality, National Harmony, and Unified State," declared:

(1) To accuse foreign interference and the actions of the Phoumi-Boun Oum group to the domestic people and world public opinion; (2) To support the only government of the Kingdom of Laos—the Souvanna Phouma legitimate government; (3) To cooperate with the government and people of the Kingdom of Laos to oppose foreign interference and the actions of the Phoumi-Boun Oum treasonous group, so that Laos can embark on a truly peaceful and neutral path and achieve national harmony.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 1st - According to Vietnam News Agency today, citing a report from the Lao Combat Forces Radio, Lao monks in Vientiane have pledged to support the Lao government's policy of peace, neutrality, and national harmony, and have expressed their determination to fight against foreign interference in Lao affairs and against the Phoumi Nosavan treasonous group.

This declaration was made by the monks at a meeting held in Vientiane.

The meeting began on November 24th and ended on the 26th.

The meeting also praised the negotiations between the delegation of the Royal Lao Government and the delegation of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, and expressed support for the Committee for Peaceful Neutrality, National Harmony, and Unified State.
