    Behind the "Fourth Atomic Power" Plan
    --A New Contest Unfolds at the North Atlantic Council Meeting
    　Xi Linsheng
    The annual North Atlantic Council meeting held in Paris concluded on the 18th. According to a statement by U.S. Secretary of State Herter, "the most important issue discussed at this meeting was the long-term (arms expansion and war preparation) plan of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization," which is the plan proposed by Herter at the beginning of the meeting to arm this aggressive bloc with U.S. nuclear missiles, making it the "fourth atomic power." The communique adopted at the meeting, after the usual boasting about "unity" and "cooperation," also clamored that "nuclear and conventional forces" of the North Atlantic Group "must be maintained" to deal with the Soviet Union. Needless to say, this meeting, like previous sessions of the Council, is intended to actively promote a policy of war and aggression, and U.S. imperialism is spurring its military bloc to accelerate the pace of atomic arms expansion and war preparation.
    Before the opening of this Council meeting, American and Western newspapers had already revealed that the United States would propose a "new Atlantic Treaty" at this meeting. The U.S. "New York Times" said that the important consideration was to "turn the North Atlantic Treaty Organization into a new atomic power." A British newspaper said that U.S. President Eisenhower had prepared a plan for this meeting to make the North Atlantic Group a "powerful new alliance," which is to enable the group to "establish its own nuclear strategic force." The so-called "fourth atomic power," which is heavily publicized by Western newspapers, stipulates that the United States will provide its North Atlantic Group headquarters with five nuclear submarines each equipped with sixteen "Polaris" medium-range missiles in three years, i.e., 1963, so that this aggressive group has "its own disposal" of "nuclear deterrence," and by 1964, the Western European "allies" will pay for the purchase of another 100 medium-range missiles from the United States to strengthen the nuclear armament of these countries. At the same time, the North Atlantic Group will organize a "nuclear mobile force" composed of the armies of the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany as a supplement to cope with "increasingly important" local wars. Using medium-range missiles to "destroy Soviet cities" to prepare for a world war, and relying on "mobile forces" armed with tactical nuclear weapons to launch local wars, this is the essence of the United States' "fourth atomic power."
    The United States has already formulated quite a few accelerated arms expansion plans for the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. In previous years, there were plans to strengthen the North Atlantic "shield defense force," and in recent years, there have been the "MC-70" plan to establish U.S. missile bases in Western Europe and to "modernize" the armies of Western European countries. Now the "fourth atomic power" is being promoted. But although there are war preparedness plans every year, this year is different. In the past, according to the United States' so-called North Atlantic Group's "sword and shield" theory, the sword of this military group's modern offensive weapons was held by the United States, while the troops of Western European countries served as the shield. Therefore, for a long time, the United States has firmly controlled the strategic bombers, atomic rockets, and nuclear warheads of the North Atlantic Group, and some Western European "allies" never wanted to get involved. However, now the United States is "generously" preparing to take out some nuclear submarines and nuclear missiles to be assigned to the North Atlantic Group for "control" and "joint control" with the "allies." Some U.S. officials are also constantly releasing information that if the "allies" accept this plan, the U.S. government is willing to have Congress amend the law prohibiting the export of atomic secrets, indicating that the United States has no intention of "monopolizing" and is willing to "share" with the "allies." It is said that this is an "epoch-making initiative" that will open a "new stage" in the history of the North Atlantic Group.
    The United States' "relaxation" of military control over the North Atlantic Group does not indicate its generosity. This is just another effort by the United States to continue to maintain its "leadership position" within the imperialist camp. In addition, due to the continuous development of the new economic crisis in the United States, Wall Street is more eager to continue to intensify the "Cold War" and accelerate atomic arms expansion as an "economic stimulant." The U.S. "Commercial and Financial Chronicle" once blatantly stated: "There is nothing else that can save the tottering economy except an outbreak of a Korean-type war or a sudden major intensification of the 'Cold War'." Making the North Atlantic Group a new atomic force under U.S. control is based on this consideration. The U.S. "Stone Weekly" once admitted: The establishment of the "fourth atomic power" plan "is favored by our country's growing missile industry, which regards the dissemination of these monsters (guided missiles) as a guarantee of market expansion." To maintain a system of man exploiting man, a system of man slaughtering man is required, which is determined by the nature of imperialism.
    However, the United States' current attempt to implement this aggressive policy is hindered by the numerous contradictions within the North Atlantic Group. Some "allies," especially France, have consistently refused to implement the U.S.'s various war preparation plans on the grounds that they cannot share the "control" of nuclear weapons. Therefore, in order to achieve its goals, the United States is now taking a step back to advance, indicating its willingness to meet the "allies'" requirements for "joint control." The United States knows that the so-called "joint control" will only result in "Norstad's finger still being the only finger pressing the (missile) launch button." This empty favor can both drive the "allies" to obey the U.S.'s will to expand armaments and trick them into paying for U.S. missiles out of their own pockets. The U.S. plan also has many advantages: According to the U.S. "New York Herald Tribune," it "may make it easier for some North Atlantic Treaty Organization members to agree to provide nuclear weapons to West Germany, make France less eager to pursue a go-it-alone nuclear policy, and ease the worries of some British people about U.S. bases." Thus, "only the United States will remain as an independent hydrogen power" (British "Daily Mail").
    Therefore, as soon as the North Atlantic Group Council opened, U.S. Secretary of State Herter could not wait to peddle the arms expansion plan to its "allies." In order to coerce Western European partners to accept this proposal, Herter threatened to "redeploy on a large scale" U.S. troops in Western Europe. The U.S. Secretary of Defense also publicly announced that the United States would stop providing military "aid" to Britain, France, West Germany and other countries by means of "gifts", but would require Western European countries to "buy American military goods" instead. However, despite the efforts of U.S. authorities, at this North Atlantic Group Council, apart from the West Germans who "seemed to be the most enthusiastic" about the U.S.'s arms expansion plan, it "failed to receive very enthusiastic support from all European allies." The enthusiasm of West Germany is conceivable, because it is making every effort to carry out atomic armament and trying every means to obtain various modern nuclear weapons. Now the "fourth atomic power" plan proposed by the United States can bypass the prohibition of the Paris Agreement that does not allow West Germany to manufacture nuclear weapons and enable it to "hold the hilt of the atomic sword" (West German "Süddeutsche Zeitung"), and at the same time weaken the atomic power in the hands of Britain and France, so why not do it? Therefore, when Norstad recently proposed the establishment of a "nuclear mobile force," West Germany hurriedly expressed its willingness to provide a battalion of troops for this force. At the North Atlantic Group Council, West Germany also repeatedly urged the meeting to "formulate specific plans" on the U.S. proposal.
    The reason why Britain, France and other European "allies" are "deliberately indifferent" to the U.S.'s proposal is not because they are not interested in the expansion of atomic armament and war preparation. On the contrary, these countries themselves are spending huge sums of money and increasing the burden on the people to engage in "nuclear deterrence," and are colluding with each other within the North Atlantic Group to jointly manufacture various new weapons. However, they are doing this to raise their own status as major powers, not to carry the sedan chair for the United States. It is reported that some European countries are happy to have five U.S. nuclear submarines assigned to them at no cost, but reject the U.S. proposal to sell them 100 medium-range missiles. Of course, the United States cannot agree to this. The United States pointed out that "their proposal is a package proposal, and the provision of five atomic submarines depends at least to some extent on whether European countries are willing to further purchase U.S. missiles." If Western European countries do not take the latter step, these "submarines will still be the property of the United States. They will remain in the Sixth Fleet or go to any other place." Another West German newspaper wrote: "Frankly speaking, this would mean that European partners should pay for the five Polaris submarines and one hundred medium-range missiles that have already been promised, without getting an independent power of control from the United States. This would be more of a financial integration than a political integration."
    With their own plans in mind, Britain adopted a two-faced attitude towards the U.S. plan. On the one hand, it is worried that this plan will force Britain to hand over its own nuclear weapons under its control to the United States, weaken its influence as the only country with nuclear weapons in Western Europe, and at the same time fear that West Germany will obtain nuclear weapons and further compete with Britain for hegemony. Therefore, Britain insists that it "will never consider changing the policy of maintaining an independent nuclear deterrent," expresses "hope to maintain the current arrangement," and expresses "reservations" about the U.S. plan. However, on the other hand, it has set up a back road. In case this plan is realized, Britain will provide some atomic weapons under the principle of "not harming" its "independent nuclear power" to ensure that the future "fourth atomic power" has its share of leadership. Nevertheless, Britain still hopes that this plan will die a natural death, and is currently using the opposition forces of other Western European countries to drag down the U.S. plan. As for France, needless to say, it has always been a fierce opponent of any U.S. "integration plan" that would require it to abandon atomic armament. De Gaulle has long publicly stated that France must possess atomic weapons, "without this weapon, we can no longer become a sovereign country, but only a unified satellite country." French officials have also publicly expressed "definitely disapprove" of the U.S.'s "fourth atomic power plan." It is precisely because of this insurmountable contradiction of imperialism that this North Atlantic Group Council only achieved "limited results" and could not make "any important decisions." The U.S. plan was only generally mentioned to be "studied in detail."
    Of course, the United States did not give up on this. It is reported that the United States will try its best to promote this aggressive plan at the North Atlantic Conference in the spring of next year. U.S. imperialism will never lay down its butcher knife. For the private interests of a small number of large monopoly organizations, the United States is trying its best to push the world to the brink of war. Therefore, people must remain highly vigilant against the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to prepare for war. (Attached picture)

    在“第四原子力量”计划的幕后
    ——北大西洋集团理事会会议上展开的一场新的角斗　席林生
    一年一度在巴黎举行的北大西洋集团理事会会议已经在18日收场。据美国国务卿赫脱发表的声明说，这次会议“所讨论的问题中最重要的一项，是北大西洋公约组织的长期（扩军备战）计划”，也就是赫脱在会议一开始提出的以美国核导弹武装这个侵略集团，使之成为“第四原子力量”的计划。会议通过的公报在照例吹嘘一番“团结”和“合作”之后，也叫嚷“必须保持”北大西洋集团的“核力量和常规力量”来对付苏联。不用说，这次会议同过去历届理事会一样，为了积极推行战争政策和侵略政策，美国帝国主义正催马加鞭地驱使它的军事集团加速原子扩军备战的步伐。
    在这次理事会开会之前，美国和西方报刊就已经透露，美国将在这次会议上提出一个“新的大西洋条约”。美国《纽约时报》说，这个重要的考虑是要“把北大西洋公约组织变成一支新的原子力量”。一家英国报纸说，美国总统艾森豪威尔给这次会议准备了一个使北大西洋集团成为“一个强大的新联盟”的计划，就是使这个集团“建立自己的核战略力量”。西方报刊大事宣扬的所谓“第四原子力量”，就是规定美国在三年后，即1963年向它的北大西洋集团司令部提供五艘各装备有十六枚“北极星”式中程导弹的核潜艇，使这个侵略集团拥有“自己支配”的“核威慑力量”，到1964年再由西欧“盟国”自己出钱向美国购买另外一百枚中程导弹以加强这些国家的核武装。而在此同时，北大西洋集团再组织一支以美、英、法、西德等国军队构成的“核机动部队”作为补充，以应付“越来越重要的”地方性战争。用中程导弹“摧毁苏联城市”来准备世界战争；靠以战术原子武器武装起来的“机动部队”来发动局部战争，这就是美国的“第四原子力量”的实质。
    本来美国为北大西洋侵略集团制定的加速扩军的计划已是不少。前几年有所谓加强北大西洋“盾牌防御力量”的计划，近年又有在西欧建立美国导弹基地和使西欧各国军队“现代化”的“MC—70”方案。而现在抬出了“第四原子力量”。但是备战方案虽然年年有，今年却是花样不同。过去根据美国的所谓北大西洋集团“剑与盾”的理论，这个军事集团的现代化进攻性武器的这支剑由美国掌握，而西欧各国的部队则充任挡箭的盾牌。因此，长期以来美国始终把北大西洋集团的战略轰炸机、原子火箭和核弹头等武器牢牢控制在自己手中，西欧一些“盟国”休想问津。可是，现在美国虽然大为“慷慨”地准备拿出一部分核潜艇和核导弹划归北大西洋集团“支配”，与“盟国共同控制”。而一些美国官方人士还不断放出空气，如果“盟国”接受这个计划，美国政府愿意使国会修改禁止输出原子秘密的法案，表示美国无意“独占”，而与“盟国共享”的诚意。据说，这是一个“划时代的创举”，将在北大西洋集团历史上开辟一个“新阶段”。
    美国这种“放松”对北大西洋集团军事控制的表示绝不是表明它的大方。这只不过是美国企图继续维持它对帝国主义阵营内的“领导地位”的又一次努力。此外，由于美国新的经济危机的不断发展，华尔街更迫切地要求继续加剧“冷战”，加紧原子扩军，以作为“经济上的兴奋剂”。美国《商业金融纪事报》曾经露骨地说：“除了爆发一次朝鲜型战争，或是“冷战突然大大加剧之外，再没有别的东西可以挽救摇摇欲坠的经济了”。使北大西洋集团成为美国控制下的一支新的原子力量就是出于这种考虑。美国《斯通周刊》就曾承认：建立“第四原子力量”计划“得到我国日益发展的导弹工业的赞成，他们把这些怪物（指导弹）的散播作为市场扩展的保证”。要维持人剥削人的制度，就需要人屠杀人的制度，这是帝国主义的本质所决定了的。
    但是，美国目前要推行这项侵略政策由于北大西洋集团内部的重重矛盾而受到阻碍。一些“盟国”，特别是法国始终以不能分享核武器的“控制权”为由拒绝执行美国的各种备战计划。因此，为了达到目的，美国这次以退为进，表示愿意满足“盟国”的“共同控制”的要求。美国知道，所谓“共同控制”结果只是“诺斯塔德的手指头将仍旧是按在（这些导弹）发射电钮上的唯一的手指头”。而这种空头人情既可驱使“盟国”服从美国的扩军意志，又可骗取它们自掏腰包购买美国导弹。美国的计划还有不少妙处：据美国《纽约先驱论坛报》说，它“可能使得某些北大西洋公约组织成员更易于同意向西德提供核武器，使法国不那么急于奉行一个单干的核政策，而又可以缓和某些英国人士对美国基地的耽心”。从而“将只有美国保持作为一个独立的氢力量”（英国《每日邮报》）。
    因此，当北大西洋集团理事会一开幕，美国国务卿赫脱就迫不及待地向它的“盟国”兜销扩军计划。为了胁迫西欧伙伴接受这个主张，赫脱提出“重新大规模部署”美国在西欧军队相要挟。美国国防部长也公然宣布，美国将停止用“赠送”方式给予英、法、西德等国军事“援助”，而要西欧国家以“买美国军火来代替。但是，尽管美国当权人物花了不少力气，在这次北大西洋集团理事会上，对于美国的这项扩军计划除了西德人“显得最热心”之外，“未能得到全体欧洲盟国十分热情的支持。”西德的这种热心是可以想见的，因为它正在竭力进行原子武装，百般设法获取各种现代化核武器。现在美国提出的“第四原子力量”计划既可绕过巴黎协定的不准西德制造核武器禁令而使它“握住原子剑的剑把”（西德《南德意志报》），同时又能削弱英、法手上的原子力量，这何乐而不为。因此，当最近诺斯塔德一提出成立“核机动部队”，西德急忙表示愿意为这支部队提供一营兵力。在北大西洋集团理事会上，西德也一再敦促会议就美国的建议“制订出具体的计划”。
    英国、法国和其他一些欧洲“盟国”对美国的建议所以“故意冷淡”并不是因为它们对于原子武装的扩军备战不感兴趣。相反的，这些国家自己也在不惜耗费巨资，加重人民负担，搞起“核威慑力量”，并且在北大西洋集团内相互勾结联合制造各种新式武器。不过它们这样做是为了抬高自己的大国地位，可不是为了替美国抬轿子。有消息说，一些欧洲国家乐于不付任何代价地把五艘美国核潜艇交它们支配，但是拒绝美国要卖给它们一百枚中程导弹的建议。当然，美国对此是不能同意的。美国指出“他们的建议是一个包裹建议，五艘原子潜艇的提供至少在某种程度上取决于欧洲国家是否愿意进一步购买美国的导弹。”如果西欧国家不采取后一步骤，这些“潜艇仍旧是美国的财产。它们将留在第六舰队，或者开到任何其他地方去。”另外一家西德报纸写道：“坦率地说这将意味着欧洲伙伴应当为已经答应了的五艘北极星潜水艇和一百个中程导弹付款，而不会从美国那里得到一种独立的、支配权力。这会是一种更多是财经上的一体化而不是政治上的一体化。”
    由于怀着自己的打算，英国对美国的计划采取了两面的态度。一方面它担心这一计划逼使英国向美国交出它自己控制的核武器，削弱它作为西欧唯一拥有核武装的国家的影响，同时害怕西德因此而获得核武器进一步同英国争霸。因此，英国坚持“决不考虑改变英国保持独立核威慑力量的政策”，表示“希望保持目前的安排”，对美国的计划表示“保留”。但是，另一方面它又设下了一条后路，万一这个计划得到实现，英国将在“不妨害”它“独立核力量”的原则下提供某些原子武器，以保证未来的“第四原子力量”中有它一分领导权。尽管如此，英国还是希望这个计划寿终正寝，目前它正利用西欧其他国家的反对力量把美国的计划拖垮。至于法国更不用说了，它对于任何要它放弃原子武装的美国“一体化计划”一直是激烈的反对者。戴高乐早就公开说过，法国必须拥有原子武器，“没有这种武器，我们再也不能成为一个主权国，而只是一个统一的卫星国”。法国官员也公开表示“肯定地不赞成”美国的“第四原子力量计划”。正是由于帝国主义这种无法克服的矛盾，这次北大西洋集团理事会仅获得“有限的结果”，而作不出“任何重要的决定”。美国的计划也只是泛泛地被提到“将详细研究”。
    当然，美国并没有就此罢休。有消息说，在明年春季的北大西洋会议上美国还将要竭力推行这项侵略计划。美帝国主义是绝不会放下它的屠刀的。为了一小撮大垄断组织的私利，美国竭力把世界推向战争的边缘。因此人们对于美帝国主义准备战争的阴谋，必须仍然保持高度的警惕。（附图片）
