Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 25th: The full text of Guangdong Province Governor Chen Yu's speech at the banquet in honor of Prince Sihanouk is as follows:
    Your Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk, distinguished Cambodian guests, friends, comrades:
    Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the distinguished Cambodian statesman, a respected friend of the Chinese people, and the Head of State of Cambodia, has once again come to Guangzhou City in our province for a friendly visit, bringing with him the precious friendship of the Cambodian people, after visiting our capital Beijing and Nanjing and Hangzhou. Now, with unparalleled excitement and joy, I represent the people of Guangdong Province and extend a warm welcome to His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk, to His Excellency Vice Chairman Nhiek Tioulong, His Excellency Prime Minister Pho Proeung, His Excellency ?·刁龙 First Deputy Prime Minister, and all the distinguished Cambodian guests accompanying His Royal Highness.
    The people of Guangdong Province, like the people of the whole country, are particularly excited that our government and the Royal Government of Cambodia have signed the Sino-Cambodian Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression. The signing of this treaty fully embodies the victory of our government's peaceful foreign policy and the Royal Government of Cambodia's policy of peace and neutrality. It also demonstrates our two countries' firm common belief in the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Here, we warmly congratulate the signing of this treaty.
    There is a long-standing traditional friendship between the peoples of China and Cambodia, who have always lived together peacefully in friendship. In recent years, this traditional friendship has experienced encouraging development. His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk's three visits to our country, Premier Zhou Enlai's two visits to Cambodia, and the recently signed Sino-Cambodian Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression are the best examples of the development of our two countries' friendship. The visits and contacts between the leaders of the two countries have greatly enhanced mutual understanding and trust and strengthened the friendly cause of the two peoples.
    We express our sincere gratitude and respect to His Royal Highness for his valuable contributions to strengthening Sino-Cambodian friendship.
    Now, I propose a toast:
    To the health of His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk,
    To the health of His Excellency Vice Chairman Nhiek Tioulong, His Excellency Prime Minister Pho Proeung, His Excellency ?·刁龙 First Deputy Prime Minister,
    To the health of all the distinguished Cambodian guests,
    To the ever-growing friendship between the peoples of China and Cambodia,
    To world peace,
    Cheers!

    在欢送西哈努克亲王宴会上
    陈郁省长的讲话
    新华社广州25日电　广东省省长陈郁在欢送西哈努克亲王宴会上的讲话，全文如下：尊敬的诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王殿下，尊敬的柬埔寨贵宾们，朋友们，同志们：
    柬埔寨杰出的政治家、中国人民尊敬的朋友，柬埔寨国家元首诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王殿下，带着柬埔寨人民的珍贵友谊，在访问了我国首都北京和南京、杭州以后，再一次光临我省广州市进行友好访问。现在我以无比兴奋和喜悦的心情，代表广东省全省人民，向西哈努克亲王殿下，向随同亲王殿下前来的宾努副主席阁下、福·波伦首相阁下、?·刁龙第一副首相阁下和柬埔寨全体贵宾，表示热烈的欢迎。
    广东省人民和全国人民一样，感到特别兴奋的是，我国政府和柬埔寨王国政府签订了中柬友好和互不侵犯条约。这个条约的签订，充分体现了我国政府的和平外交政策和柬埔寨王国政府的和平中立政策的胜利。同时也表明了我们两国对于和平共处五项原则具有坚强的共同信念。在这里，我们热烈祝贺这一条约的签订。
    中柬两国人民之间有着历史悠久的传统友谊，一向是友好地和平相处。近年来，这种传统友谊又有了令人鼓舞的发展，西哈努克亲王殿下三次访问我国，我国周恩来总理两次访问了柬埔寨，和最近签订的中柬友好和互不侵犯条约，就是我们两国友谊发展的最好的例证。两国领导人之间的访问和接触，大大增进了相互的了解和信任，加强了两国人民的友好事业。
    我们对亲王殿下在加强中柬友谊中所作出的宝贵贡献，表示真诚的感谢和敬意。
    现在，我提议：
    为西哈努克亲王殿下的健康，
    为宾努副主席阁下、福·波伦首相阁下、?·刁龙第一副首相阁下的健康，
    为柬埔寨全体贵宾们的健康，
    为中柬两国人民日益发展的友谊，
    为世界和平，
    干杯！
