Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, December 26th: Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk and his entourage returned to Phnom Penh this afternoon after concluding their visits to the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Mongolia, and China. Prince Sihanouk was warmly welcomed by thousands of Cambodians at the airport and along the route from the airport.

Prince Sihanouk delivered a speech at the airport regarding his trip abroad. He said that the purpose of his trip was "to continuously make more friends in the world, strengthen the ties of friendship, solidarity, and cooperation with those countries that treat us very well and that we can rely on in all situations, both large and small, and to establish and develop trade with as many countries as possible, while seeking technical and economic assistance so that our country can move forward more quickly along the path of progress."

Prince Sihanouk said, "This trip abroad has been very satisfactory in all respects."

He said that in terms of national prestige, he and his entourage had never been received with such enthusiasm and solemnity.

He said, "The achievements made in the cooperation with the great friendly countries are at least as great as those made in 1956." He said, "This year, I am very happy to be able to forge a sincere friendship between our country and the Mongolian People's Republic."

He further said, "As for Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and China, they are our great and truly sincere old friends, and their sincere friendship has admirably stood the test of time and events. We have strengthened our relations with them. This strengthening of relations is reflected in increased cooperation to defend our common ideals, peace, peaceful coexistence, freedom, independence, and justice; it is reflected in the continuation and development of cultural and trade exchanges as well as technical and economic assistance; it is reflected in a renewed and very firm support for our country's national independence, our neutrality, and our territorial integrity. This is invaluable for our country's neutrality and our country's territorial integrity, and it is invaluable for our country."

Sihanouk then spoke about the various economic and technical assistance received from Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and China.

In expressing his gratitude for China's assistance, he pointed out that Cambodia has been taking action internationally to restore all the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China, first and foremost the legitimate seat of the Chinese people in the United Nations. He said, "In this regard, our Chinese friends have not hesitated to express their gratitude to Cambodia and believe that our support is as valuable as their assistance."

Prince Sihanouk concluded by saying, "We are deeply grateful to the governments of all those countries that enable us to maintain our national dignity."

He said, "It is precisely for this reason that we should all thank and respect Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, the Mongolian People's Republic, and the People's Republic of China."

Sihanouk's speech was constantly interrupted by thunderous applause.

Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, December 26th: Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk and his entourage returned to Phnom Penh on the afternoon of the 26th after concluding their visits to the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Mongolia, and China.

That evening, all residents of the city were invited to participate in a carnival held in front of the Royal Palace of Cambodia to celebrate Prince Sihanouk's successful visit to the four socialist countries.
