A New Stage in the Friendly Relations Between China and Afghanistan

The Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression between the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Afghanistan has entered into force on December 12 in Beijing, with the exchange of instruments of ratification by representatives of both sides, after the completion of the final legal procedures by China and Afghanistan. From now on, the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Afghanistan have entered a new historical stage. The Chinese people, together with the Afghan people, express warm congratulations on this.

More than three months ago, when Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi visited the Kingdom of Afghanistan, the governments of China and Afghanistan signed this treaty. Subsequently, the two governments quickly completed the ratification of the treaty and exchanged instruments of ratification. This treaty stipulates that the two contracting parties recognize and respect each other's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, maintain peaceful and friendly relations between the two countries, guarantee non-aggression against each other, not participate in military alliances directed against the other party, and develop and further strengthen economic and cultural relations between the two countries. It fully expresses the common aspirations of the two peoples and is a major achievement of the Chinese and Afghan governments in further strengthening the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries and further enhancing the friendship between our two peoples.

In ancient times, the ancestors of the Chinese and Afghan peoples braved hardships and dangers to open up the "Silk Road" for the dissemination of friendship between our two peoples. The friendship between the Chinese and Afghan peoples has been passed down from generation to generation in this way, continuously. Our two peoples have always cared for each other and sympathized with each other in the years when we were engaged in heroic struggles against colonialist aggressors, and our friendship has stood the test of history. However, the flower of friendship between the Chinese and Afghan peoples has never bloomed so luxuriantly as it does now. Today, not only are friendly folk delegations traveling back and forth on the Beijing-Kabul road every year, but also the national leaders and government delegations of the two countries have conducted frequent friendly visits with each other. His Majesty King Mohammed Zahir of the Kingdom of Afghanistan has accepted the invitation of Chairman Liu Shaoqi of our country and will come to our country for a friendly visit. Economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries are also flourishing. These are all unprecedented in the history of relations between China and Afghanistan. And now, we can proudly say that in our generation, we have concluded the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression between China and Afghanistan. This means that we have opened up a new "Silk Road." We have laid a solid foundation not only for our generation, but also for the friendly coexistence between the Chinese and Afghan peoples for generations to come.

Establishing and developing peaceful and friendly relations between the peoples of all countries is the common aspiration of all peace-loving people in the world. The people of Asian and African countries, having suffered from imperialist and colonialist aggression and oppression for a long time, more deeply understand the value of peace and friendship. It is precisely because of this that the historical Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit were born on the land of Asia and Africa. The people of Asian and African countries generally demand unity, striving to oppose imperialism and colonialism, establish and expand peace zones, and safeguard peace in the Asian and African regions and the world. Now, the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression between China and Afghanistan has consolidated and further developed the relations of equality, mutual benefit, and friendly cooperation between the two countries. This is a new victory for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and thus makes a positive contribution to the noble cause of peace and friendship of the people of Asia and the world.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, it has consistently adhered to a peaceful foreign policy and a good-neighborly policy. Since this year, China has successively signed treaties of peace and friendship or friendship and non-aggression with Myanmar, Nepal, Afghanistan, and Guinea. The Chinese government has also repeatedly proposed that all countries in the Asian and Pacific region, including the United States, conclude a treaty of non-aggression and peace in order to effectively guarantee peace in the Asian and Pacific region. All of these eloquently prove that the Chinese government and the Chinese people have consistently made unremitting efforts to seek the development of friendly relations with the people of all countries in the world, especially with our neighbors. As Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai once said: In international affairs, steadfastly striving for the noble goals of world peace and human progress "is not only a policy that we Chinese of this generation must follow, but also a policy that our future generations must follow."

China and Afghanistan are two peace-loving countries and friendly neighbors. We firmly believe that the friendship between the Chinese and Afghan peoples will grow day by day on the basis of deep traditional friendship.

### 中国阿富汗友好关系的新阶段

    中国阿富汗友好关系的新阶段
    中华人民共和国和阿富汗王国友好和互不侵犯条约，经过中阿双方完成最后法律程序，已于12月12日在北京由双方代表互换批准书，宣告生效了。从此，中阿两国的友好合作关系进入了一个新的历史阶段。中国人民同阿富汗人民一道，对此表示热烈的庆祝。
    三个多月以前，当我国陈毅副总理兼外交部长访问阿富汗王国期间，中阿两国政府签订了这个条约，随即两国政府迅速地完成了条约的批准并互换了批准书。这个条约规定缔约双方承认和尊重彼此的独立、主权和领土完整，保持两国之间的和平友好关系，保证互不侵犯，不参加针对另一方的军事同盟，发展和进一步加强两国之间的经济和文化关系。它充分表达了两国人民的共同愿望，是中国和阿富汗两国政府进一步加强我们两国的友好合作关系和进一步增进我们两国人民之间友谊的一个重大成就。
    在古老的年代，中阿两国人民的祖先曾经不畏艰险，为我们两国人民开辟了传播友谊的“丝绸之路”。中阿两国人民的友谊就这样一代一代地流传下来，绵延不绝。我们两国人民在各自对殖民主义侵略势力进行英勇斗争的年月里一直是互相关怀、互相同情，我们的友谊是经过历史的考验的。但是，中阿两国人民友谊的花朵，从来没有像现在这样开得如此茂盛。如今不仅是民间的友好代表团，每年络绎不绝于北京—喀布尔道上，而且是两国的国家领导人和政府代表团也相互地进行了频繁的友好访问。阿富汗王国国王穆罕默德·查希尔陛下已接受我国刘少奇主席的邀请，将前来我国进行友好访问。两国之间的经济和文化交流也日益昌隆。这些在中阿两国的关系史上都是空前的。而现在，我们更可以自豪地说，在我们这一代的手里，缔结了中阿友好和互不侵犯条约。这意味着，我们开辟了一条新的“丝绸之路”。我们不仅为自己一代，也为了中阿两国人民世世代代之间的友好相处，奠定了牢固的基石。
    建立和发展各国人民之间的和平与友好关系，是全世界一切爱好和平的人民的共同愿望。亚非各国人民由于长期遭受帝国主义和殖民主义的侵略和压迫，更加深刻地理解和平与友好的可贵。正是因为这样，所以在亚非的土地上，诞生了历史性的和平共处五项原则和万隆精神。亚非各国人民普遍要求团结一致，为反对帝国主义和殖民主义、建立和扩大和平地区、维护亚非地区和全世界的和平而努力。现在中阿友好和互不侵犯条约，使两国之间的平等互利和友好合作的关系得到了巩固和进一步的发展，这是和平共处五项原则的一个新胜利，因而对亚洲及全世界人民的和平与友好的崇高事业作出了积极的贡献。
    中华人民共和国自从建国之日起，就一贯坚持和平外交政策和睦邻政策。今年以来，中国同缅甸、尼泊尔、阿富汗和几内亚接连地签订了和平友好或者友好和互不侵犯条约。中国政府并且多次建议亚洲和太平洋地区的所有国家，包括美国在内，缔结一项互不侵犯的和平公约，以切实有效地保障亚洲和太平洋地区的和平。所有这些，都雄辩地证明，中国政府和中国人民一贯为谋求同全世界各国人民特别是同我们的邻邦发展友好关系进行不懈的努力。正如我国周恩来总理曾经说过的：在国际事务中，坚定不移地为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力，“这不仅是我们这一代中国人所必须遵循的方针，而且也是我们后代子孙所必须遵循的方针。”
    中国和阿富汗，是两个爱好和平的国家，又是友好的邻邦。我们完全相信，中阿两国人民的友谊在深厚的传统友谊的基础上，必将与日俱增。
