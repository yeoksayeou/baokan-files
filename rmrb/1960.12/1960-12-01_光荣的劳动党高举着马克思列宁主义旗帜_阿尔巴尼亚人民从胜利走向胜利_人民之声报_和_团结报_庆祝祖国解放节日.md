Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 29th - The Albanian newspapers "People's Voice" and "Unity" published editorials today celebrating the sixteenth anniversary of Albania's liberation.

    "People's Voice," in an editorial titled "Long Live the Glorious Day of the Motherland's Liberation," stated that today, all the people of our country are jubilantly celebrating the sixteenth anniversary of the liberation of the motherland from the rule of foreign occupiers and domestic traitors. The editorial stated, "Our people have every reason to regard the victory of the people's revolution not only as a glorious victory over the barbaric Nazi fascist enemy but also as the result of generations of efforts by the Albanian people for freedom and independence, and for social progress."

    The editorial said that the Albanian people unhesitatingly and fearlessly threw themselves entirely into the struggle against the occupiers, bravely resisting the enemy's powerful military machine. The root of such great moral and spiritual strength displayed by our people at such a time lies in their high and consistent revolutionary patriotism, in their desire and invincible will to see the freedom and independence of the motherland, and in their traditional internationalism. Especially in the new, loyal, and wise leadership ahead of them, namely their Party. They believe in the correctness of the Party's line.

    The editorial said that after reviewing the path taken over the past sixteen years, our people have every reason to be proud of their heroic achievements and to be proud of the battles and labor they have undertaken under the leadership of the Party to achieve the victory of socialism in Albania. Socialism is today a great reality, and the achievements our country has made are truly great achievements.

    The editorial said, "The new socialist Albania, from its earliest days, has been fighting alongside the countries building socialism. No force can or ever will be able to divert her from this path. Under the leadership of its Party, the Albanian people have heroically crushed all attempts by imperialism and its servant, the Yugoslav revisionists, to obstruct our march towards socialist victory. Our country today enjoys great international prestige as a peace-loving country. She resolutely fights for peaceful coexistence, against imperialist plans of aggression, to defend peace, and to strive for friendship and cooperation between all peoples."

    The editorial said that our people are a people who have suffered hardships. They have endured the most barbaric horrors of war, and they have shed blood for their freedom and independence. They abhor war, desire stable world peace, and hope for only friendship and understanding between all peoples. However, our people also clearly see that the imperialists have not abandoned their aims of plundering and enslaving all peoples. For this reason, they resolutely and uncompromisingly oppose imperialism and its tool, the Belgrade revisionists. Our people have defended and will unswervingly defend the victory of the people's revolution, defend their freedom and independence, and defend their path to socialism. As in the past, they will not bow to any difficulties and will raise revolutionary vigilance to crush all attempts by imperialism and its servants.

    The editorial said that our people, educated by the Labor Party, will, as always, fight to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp and wage tireless struggle for the victory of socialism and peace.

    The editorial concluded by saying that the path chosen by the Albanian people is in accordance with their vital interests and with the interests of socialism and world peace. Today, on the sixteenth anniversary of the liberation of our motherland, our people have expressed their deep love and gratitude to their wise and courageous leadership—the Central Committee of the Labor Party headed by Comrade Hoxha—and have also expressed their determination to continue to fight under the invincible Marxist-Leninist banner of our Party to defend the victories already achieved on the road of socialist construction and to achieve new victories. In the ranks of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, under the leadership of their Party, and under the banner of invincible Marxism-Leninism, the Albanian people will surely advance from victory to victory.

    "Unity" newspaper's editorial introduced the achievements made by the Albanian people in the war of liberation and since liberation.

    The editorial said that in the sixteen years of construction work, our people have also best demonstrated their noble qualities, their creativity, their indomitable attitude towards difficulties, and their firm and unwavering will to overcome them.

    The editorial said that the Albanian people began to build socialism under very difficult material conditions and surrounded by hostile countries. We started building socialism with a pick in one hand and a gun in the other.

    The editorial said that our country's international position is solid and strong. As a loyal member of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, our people spare no effort in the struggle for peace and the victory of socialism. The People's Republic of Albania resolutely adheres to a policy of peace and international cooperation based on the principles of peaceful coexistence. The Albanian Labor Party educates our people to maintain the highest vigilance against U.S. imperialism and its agents, the Yugoslav revisionists.

    光荣的劳动党高举着马克思列宁主义旗帜
    阿尔巴尼亚人民从胜利走向胜利
    “人民之声报”和“团结报”庆祝祖国解放节日
    新华社地拉那29日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》和《团结报》今天发表社论，庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放十六周年。
    《人民之声报》以《祖国光荣的解放日万岁》为题发表社论说，今天，我国全体人民欢欣鼓舞地庆祝祖国从外国占领者和本国卖国贼的统治下解放出来十六周年。社论说，“我国人民完全有理由把人民革命的胜利看成不仅是对野蛮的纳粹法西斯敌人的光荣胜利，而且也是阿尔巴尼亚人民为了自由和独立、为了社会进步而进行世世代代努力的结果。”
    社论说，阿尔巴尼亚人民毫不迟疑和毫不恐惧地全部投身于反对占领者的斗争中，英勇地抵抗了敌人的强大军事机器。我国人民在这样的时候发出这种伟大的道义力量和精神力量的根源，就在于他们高度的、始终如一的革命爱国主义，就在于他们要看到祖国的自由、独立的愿望和不可战胜的意志，就在于他们传统的国际主义。尤其在于他们前面有了新的忠实和英明的领导，即他们的党。他们相信党的路线的正确。
    社论说，我国人民在回顾十六年来所经历的道路后，完全有理由为自己的英勇业绩而自豪，完全有理由为自己在党的领导下为争取在阿尔巴尼亚社会主义的胜利而进行的战斗和劳动而自豪。社会主义在今天已经是一个伟大的现实，我国所获得的成就是真正伟大的成就。
    社论说，“社会主义的新阿尔巴尼亚从最初的日子起，就站在建设社会主义的各国的行列中进行着斗争。没有也永远不会有任何力量能够使她离开这条道路。阿尔巴尼亚人民在自己的党的领导下英勇地粉碎了帝国主义及其仆从南斯拉夫修正主义者阻挠我们走向社会主义胜利的一切企图。我国今天享有一个作为爱好和平的国家的巨大国际威信。她坚决为争取和平共处、反对帝国主义侵略计划、保卫和平、争取各国人民之间的友谊和合作而斗争。”
    社论说，我国人民是经受过苦难的人民。他们经受过最野蛮的战争恐怖，他们曾经为了自己的自由和独立流过鲜血。他们憎恶战争，希望稳定的世界和平，希望各国人民之间只有友谊和谅解。但是，我国人民也清楚地看到：帝国主义者并没有放弃掠夺和奴役各国人民的目的。正因为如此，他们坚决地、毫不妥协地反对帝国主义及其工具贝尔格莱德修正主义者。我国人民保卫了并将不屈不挠地保卫人民革命的胜利，保卫自己的自由、独立，保卫自己走向社会主义的道路。同过去一样，他们将不向任何困难低头，并将提高革命警惕性，粉碎帝国主义及其仆从的一切企图。
    社论说，为劳动党教导出来的我国人民，和以往一样，将为加强社会主义阵营的团结而斗争，为社会主义和和平事业的胜利而进行不倦的斗争。
    社论最后说，阿尔巴尼亚人民所选择的道路是符合他们的切身利益的，是符合社会主义和世界和平的利益的。今天，在我们祖国解放十六周年的日子里，我国人民表现了对他们英明、勇敢的领导——以霍查同志为首的劳动党的中央委员会的深深爱戴和感激，同时也表示了他们在今后仍将在我们党战无不胜的马克思列宁主义的旗帜下，为保卫在社会主义建设的道路上业已取得的胜利并为取得新的胜利而奋斗。在强大的、以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的行列中，在自己党的领导下，在战无不胜的马克思列宁主义旗帜下，阿尔巴尼亚人民定将从胜利走向胜利。
    《团结报》的社论介绍了阿尔巴尼亚人民在解放战争中和解放以来所取得的成就。
    社论说，我国人民在建设工作的十六年中也最好不过地表现了他们的崇高品质、他们的创造力、对困难不屈不挠的态度和克服困难的坚毅不屈的坚定意志。
    社论说，阿尔巴尼亚人民是在物质条件十分困难并在敌对国家包围的情况下开始建设社会主义的。我们是一手拿镐、一手拿枪着手建设社会主义的。
    社论说，我国的国际地位是牢固的和强有力的。作为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的忠诚的一员，我国人民不遗余力地为争取和平和社会主义的胜利而斗争。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国坚决遵循以和平共处原则为基础的和平和国际合作的政策。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党教育我国人民对美帝国主义及其代理人南斯拉夫修正主义保持最高的警惕。
