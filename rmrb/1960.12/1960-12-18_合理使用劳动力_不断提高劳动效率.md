"Since we are enthusiastic about the cause of communism, we must first be enthusiastic about developing our productive forces." This is the fundamental path pointed out by the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to the whole Party and the people to accelerate China's socialist construction and strive to realize the great ideal of mankind as soon as possible. Whether productive forces can develop rapidly depends on whether the relations of production are suitable for the nature of the productive forces and the requirements of the development of the productive forces. The rural people's commune, a new type of social organization, a new type of rural socialist relations of production, was born to meet the development requirements of rural productive forces and is suitable for the development needs of rural productive forces in our country. Therefore, the birth, growth, and consolidation of this new type of social organization, and its healthy development forward, have opened up a broad road for the rapid development of rural social productive forces in our country, enabling China's agricultural production to maintain its forward development under the conditions of severe disasters rarely seen in nearly a century, and reducing the losses caused by the disasters to the lowest possible limit. Now, the task before all cadres and the broad masses of rural people's communes is not only to resolutely implement the three-level ownership system based on the team, and improve certain links in the relations of production to make it more suitable for the needs of the constantly developing productive forces, so as to promote the more rapid development of productive forces, but also to rationally allocate and use labor force, and continuously improve labor productivity. People are the decisive factor of productive forces. Who manages and who controls the labor force is an important link in developing social productive forces and improving labor productivity. If the relationship between the two fundamental issues of productive forces and relations of production is adjusted well, our social productive forces will develop more rapidly, our socialist construction will have a new, greater, and better leap forward, our agricultural production will have a new, greater, and better high tide, and we will be more guaranteed to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture next year and continued leap forward in the future. It is precisely for this purpose that rural people's communes in various places are taking advantage of the favorable opportunity of the winter slack season to summarize the experience of the people's communes in various aspects over the past two years, further implement the three-level ownership system based on the team in terms of relations of production, and further adjust the labor force in terms of productive forces, fix the labor force for use by the production team, and strengthen the first line of agricultural production.
    The rational arrangement and rational use of labor force include two aspects: the state's arrangement and use of the entire social labor force, and the rural people's commune's internal arrangement and use of the entire labor force. According to the principle of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong, all fronts in urban and rural areas throughout the country have responded to the call of the Party Central Committee to run agriculture in a big way and run grain in a big way, and have saved labor force from all aspects to enrich the strength of agricultural production. After this simplification and adjustment, the labor force on the first line of agricultural production has been greatly strengthened and is continuing to be strengthened. This provides a strong guarantee for striving for a bumper harvest in agriculture next year and continued leap forward in the future. Now, in addition to continuing to take effective measures to save labor force from all aspects and further enrich the first line of agricultural production, the task of the people's communes is to arrange and use the entire labor force that has been greatly enriched and strengthened, and to continuously improve labor efficiency, so as to ensure that agricultural production and the entire rural economy develop faster.
    According to the experience of the past two years, rural people's communes should use the main labor force for agricultural production. Before agriculture is mechanized, ensuring that the first line of agricultural production has sufficient labor force is the central key to implementing the principle of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, and it is also the central key to ensuring grain production at present. Running various undertakings and carrying out various activities in rural areas should all be subordinate to agricultural production, revolve around agricultural production, and be for agricultural production, and must never affect agricultural production. Various undertakings and activities other than agricultural production, whether it is forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fisheries, and other production undertakings, or basic construction undertakings such as farmland water conservancy, or collective welfare, cultural education, and other facilities, must be rationally arranged, strictly controlled, and maintain appropriate quantity, appropriate scale, and appropriate speed. We cannot one-sidedly pursue more, bigger, and faster, so as to affect agricultural production. When running these undertakings and carrying out these activities, we must also pay attention to the characteristics of agricultural production, which has strong seasonality. Under the premise of not delaying agricultural production, we should do more in the slack season, do less in the busy season, and do nothing in the very busy season. We cannot emphasize specialization in everything, occupy a large number of labor force all year round, and affect agricultural production. At the same time, all kinds of undertakings and activities must strictly implement economy when using labor force. Labor creates everything, and any wealth in society is created by people. Saving labor force, saving living labor, and producing more things with less labor time and less labor force is the biggest and most fundamental saving. If we can use semi-labor force and auxiliary labor force, we must never use whole labor force and strong labor force; it is wrong to use whole labor force and strong labor force to do things that can be done with semi-labor force and auxiliary labor force. According to the experience of many communes, in addition to arranging and using the commune's labor force according to these principles, it is also necessary to establish necessary systems for the use of labor force to ensure that the whole labor force and semi-labor force (excluding auxiliary labor force) in rural areas should reach about one-third of the rural population, of which the whole labor force should account for two-thirds; at the same time, pay attention to grasping the undertakings and activities carried out by the two levels of the commune and the production team (basic accounting unit), so that the labor force they occupy does not exceed about 5%, and the remaining about 95% of the labor force is controlled by the production team and used for the first line of agricultural production; the labor force used for the first line of agricultural production must reach 80% in the busy season, and the labor force used for various undertakings such as commune-run industry, short-distance transportation, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fisheries, living welfare, and cultural education should not exceed 20% in total. It is necessary to determine this proportion and establish this system. Before China's agriculture has realized mechanization and agricultural labor productivity has not been fundamentally improved, this proportion and the system to ensure the implementation of this proportion should remain unchanged for a considerable period of time. Even if agriculture is mechanized and agricultural labor productivity has been greatly improved, at that time, we must still pay attention to the characteristics of China's agricultural production, that is, the characteristics of intensive cultivation, the extremely complex characteristics of agricultural products, the characteristics of high multiple cropping index, and so on. Therefore, even at that time, we cannot transfer too much rural labor force at once.
    Ensuring that the first line of agricultural production has sufficient labor force only provides us with the possibility of rapidly developing agricultural production. To turn the possibility into reality, we must also give full play to the enthusiasm of every laborer and continuously improve labor productivity. The experience of many people's communes in the past two years has proved that earnestly implementing the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, "when leading the work of the commune, we must pay attention to comprehensively grasping ideology, production, and life" and adhering to the principle of "doing our best and distributing according to work" can mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members and continuously improve labor productivity. That is to say, we must correctly implement the policy of combining politics in command and material guarantee. We have always believed that continuously strengthening socialist and communist education for the masses and continuously improving the class consciousness of the broad masses are the fundamental guarantees for developing the enthusiasm of the masses and accelerating socialist construction. Unilaterally emphasizing the role of material interests will lead the broad masses into the wrong path of seeking personal gain, which is a manifestation of looking down on the masses and underestimating the consciousness of the masses; however, we have also always believed that prematurely negating the principle of "distribution according to work" is also a wrong behavior of not caring about the interests of the masses. The principle of combining politics in command and material guarantee, at present, is doing our best and distributing according to work, and in the future, it is doing our best and distributing according to needs. Overemphasizing any one aspect is one-sided and wrong. The resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party once clearly pointed out that the distribution system combining wages and supply is a pioneering work of the people's communes in our country in the socialist distribution method, which provides the broad masses of peasants with the most important and reliable social insurance. It also pointed out that the people's commune "transitioned from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people, like state-owned industry, its nature is still socialist, doing its best and distributing according to work." And it clearly stipulates that "in the income of commune members of the people's commune, the wage part distributed according to work must occupy an important position for a long period of time, and will occupy a major position for a period of time." According to the practice of the people's communes in the past two years, in the part distributed to commune members for consumption, the ratio of the supply part to the wage part should be three to seven, that is, the supply part accounts for 30% and the wage part accounts for 70%. This ratio should be adhered to unchanged for a long period of time. Some comrades believe that after communization, it is not necessary to adhere to the principle of distribution according to work, and even it is not necessary to implement work evaluation and score recording. This is a violation of the Party's policy, a violation of objective laws, and of course, it is extremely wrong. The entire practical experience of the people's communes in the past two years has also proved that where the Party's policy of combining politics in command and material guarantee is earnestly implemented, the principle of doing our best and distributing according to work is adhered to, the distribution system combining wages and supply is correctly implemented, and the systems of work evaluation and score recording, basic working days, and regular salary payment are implemented, the enthusiasm of the commune members is higher, and production develops faster and better. Otherwise, it will affect the enthusiasm of the commune members, damage agricultural productive forces, and hinder the faster development of agriculture.
    Earnestly implementing the principle of combining work and rest is also an important measure to improve the enthusiasm of commune members and improve labor productivity. The broad masses of people are eagerly demanding to quickly change the backward face of our country, which is "poor and blank," and are carrying out selfless labor. This soaring enthusiasm and lofty aspirations are understandable and very valuable. This is the fundamental guarantee that we can build our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture and modern science and culture. But, as the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party pointed out, "the greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more the Party must care about the lives of the masses." The combination of work and rest is a positive measure. Because only in this way can laborers eliminate fatigue, restore physical strength, and devote themselves to new labor with strong bodies and energetic spirits. Many communes have stipulated a system of two days off per month for male commune members and four days off for female commune members, which is very good and should be widely promoted and implemented. In addition, many communes have also taken many effective measures, paying attention to hygiene, preventing and treating diseases, and attaching great importance to the special protection of women's labor, which is also very good and should also be widely promoted and implemented. In addition to promoting these effective experiences, we believe that, according to the seasonal characteristics of agricultural production, commune members should be consciously allowed to rest more in winter, especially in areas that have suffered severe disasters this year.
    The relations of production and productive forces are the two key issues for the further consolidation and development of rural people's communes in our country, and they are also the two key issues for the faster and better leap forward of agriculture in our country. Earnestly and meticulously summarizing the experience in this area, and formulating necessary rules and regulations based on these experiences, is a strong guarantee for strengthening the construction of the commune and striving for a bumper harvest in agriculture next year.

    合理使用劳动力　不断提高劳动效率
    “我们既然热心于共产主义事业，就必须首先热心于发展我们的生产力”，这是党的八届六中全会决议向全党全民指出的加速我国社会主义建设，争取早日实现人类伟大理想的根本途径。生产力能否迅速发展，决定因素是生产关系是否适合生产力的性质和生产力发展的要求。农村人民公社这个新型的社会组织，这种新型的农村社会主义生产关系，就是适应着农村生产力的发展要求而诞生的，是适合我国农村生产力发展的需要的。因此，这一新型的社会组织的诞生、成长和巩固，健康地向前发展，为我国农村社会生产力的迅速发展，开辟了宽阔的道路，使我国的农业生产在遇到近百年少有的严重灾害的条件下，仍然保持了向前发展，把灾害带来的损失减少到尽可能低的限度。现在，摆在全体干部和广大农村人民公社面前的任务是，既要坚决贯彻执行以队为基础的三级所有制，并改善生产关系的某些环节，使它更适合不断发展着的生产力的需要，以促进生产力更迅速地发展，同时也要合理地分配和使用劳动力，不断地提高劳动生产率。人是生产力的决定因素，劳动力归谁管理，归谁支配，是发展社会生产力和提高劳动生产率的重要环节。生产力和生产关系这两个根本问题之间的关系调整好了，我们的社会生产力就会更迅速地向前发展，我们的社会主义建设就会出现新的更大更好的跃进，我们的农业生产就会出现新的更大更好的高潮，我们争取明年农业大丰收和以后的继续跃进，就更加有了保证。正是为着这个目的，各地农村人民公社正在利用冬闲的有利时机，总结两年多来人民公社各方面的经验，在生产关系方面进一步贯彻三级所有、队为基础的制度，在生产力方面则进一步调整劳动力，把劳动力固定在生产小队使用，加强农业生产第一线。
    劳动力的合理安排和合理使用，包括两个方面：国家对于整个社会劳动力的安排和使用，农村人民公社内部对全部劳动力的安排和使用。根据毛泽东同志提出的农业是国民经济基础的方针，全国城乡各个战线响应党中央提出的大办农业、大办粮食的号召，从各方面节约劳动力，充实农业生产的力量。经过这次精简和调整以后，农业生产第一线上的劳动力已经大大加强起来，并且在继续加强着。这就为争取明年农业大丰收和今后继续跃进，提供了有力的保证。现在，各地方、各企业、各部门、各单位除了继续采取切实有效措施，从各方面节约劳动力，进一步充实农业生产第一线以外，人民公社的任务就是把大大充实和加强起来的全部劳动力安排好，使用好，并不断地提高劳动效率，以保证农业生产和整个农村经济更快地向前发展。
    根据两年来的经验，农村人民公社应该把主要的劳动力用于农业生产，在农业没有实现机械化以前，保证农业生产第一线有足够的劳动力，是贯彻农业是国民经济基础这一方针的中心关键，也是当前保证粮食生产的中心关键。在农村举办各项事业和进行各项活动，都应该服从农业生产，围绕农业生产，为了农业生产，绝不能影响农业生产。农业生产以外的各项事业和活动，无论是林、牧、副、渔以及社办工业等各项生产事业，还是农田水利等基本建设事业，或是集体福利、文化教育等各项设施，都必须合理安排，严格控制，保持适当的数量、适当的规模和适当的速度，不能片面地求多求大求快，以致影响农业生产。举办这些事业和进行这些活动的时候，还要注意农业生产具有强烈季节性的特点，要在不误农业生产的前提下，农闲多办，农忙少办，大忙不办，不能事事强调专业化，常年占用一大批劳动力，影响农业生产。同时，各种事业各种活动，在使用劳动力的时候必须严格地实行节约。劳动创造一切，社会上的任何财富都是人创造的。节约劳动力，节约活劳动，用更少的劳动时间、更少的劳动力生产更多的东西，是最大最根本的节约。凡是能用半劳动力和辅助劳动力的，绝不用整劳动力和强劳动力；能用半劳动力和辅助劳动力办的事情，用整劳动力和强劳动力去作是错误的。根据许多公社的经验，除了按照这些原则来安排和使用公社的劳动力以外，对劳动力的使用，还必须建立必要的制度，保证农村中整劳动力和半劳动力（不包括辅助劳动力）要达到农村人口的三分之一左右，其中整劳动力又要占三分之二；同时注意掌握公社和生产队（基本核算单位）两级举办的事业和进行的活动，使它们所占用的劳动力，不超过5％左右，其余的95％左右的劳动力，都归生产小队支配，使用于农业生产第一线；用于农业生产第一线的劳动力，农忙季节必须达到80％，社办工业、短途运输、林、牧、副、渔、生活福利以及文化教育等各项事业所用的劳动力，合计起来不要超过20％。确定这种比例和建立这种制度是必要的。在我国农业还没有实现机械化、农业劳动生产率还没有根本的提高以前，这种比例和保证这种比例执行的制度应该在相当长的时期内维持不变。就是实现了农业机械化，农业劳动生产率有了很大的提高，到了那个时候，我们还必须注意到我国农业生产的特点，即精耕细作的特点，农产品极为复杂的特点，复种指数很高的特点等等。因此，就是到了那个时候，也不能把农村劳动力一下子抽调过多。
    保证农业生产第一线有了足够的劳动力，只给我们提供了迅速发展农业生产的可能性。要把可能性变为现实，还必须充分发挥每一个劳动者的积极性和不断地提高劳动生产率。两年来，许多人民公社的经验证明，认真贯彻党的八届六中全会决议，“在领导公社工作的时候，必须注意全面地抓思想、抓生产、抓生活”和坚持“各尽所能，按劳分配”的原则，才能调动广大社员群众的积极性和不断提高劳动生产率。也就是说，必须正确贯彻政治挂帅和物质保证相结合的方针。我们从来认为不断地加强对群众的社会主义和共产主义教育，不断地提高广大群众的阶级觉悟，是发扬群众积极性加速社会主义建设的根本保证，片面强调物质利益的作用，会把广大群众引入唯利是图的歧途，是看不起群众和低估群众觉悟的一种表现；但是，我们也从来认为，过早地否定“按劳分配”原则，也是不关心群众利益的错误行为。政治挂帅和物质保证结合起来的原则，在目前来说，就是各尽所能和按劳分配，在将来，就是各尽所能和按需分配。过分强调任何一面，都是片面的、错误的。党的八届六中全会决议曾经明确地指出，工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，是我国人民公社在社会主义分配方式上的一个创举，它使广大农民得到了最重要最可靠的社会保险。同时也指出：人民公社由集体所有制“过渡到了全民所有制，如国营工业那样，它的性质还是社会主义的，各尽所能，按劳分配”。并且明确规定，“在人民公社的社员收入中，按劳分配的工资部分，在长时期内，必须占有重要地位，在一段时间内并将占有主要地位。”根据两年来人民公社的实践，在分配给社员消费的部分中，供给部分和工资部分的比例，应该三七开，即供给部分占30％，工资部分占70％，这种比例在很长时期内都应该坚持不变。有的同志认为公社化以后，可以不必坚持按劳分配的原则了，甚至可以不要实行评工记分了。这是违反党的政策的，违反客观法则的，当然是极端错误的。人民公社两年来的全部实践经验也证明，凡是认真贯彻了党的政治挂帅与物质保证相结合的方针，坚持了各尽所能、按劳分配的原则，正确执行了工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，实行了评工记分、基本劳动日以及定期发工资等制度的地方，那里的社员劳动积极性就更为高涨，那里的生产就发展得更快更好。否则，就会影响社员群众的积极性，破坏农业生产力，就会阻碍农业的更快发展。
    认真贯彻劳逸结合的原则，也是提高社员劳动积极性，提高劳动生产率的重要措施。广大人民群众迫切要求迅速改变我国“一穷二白”的落后面貌，都在进行着忘我的劳动。这种冲天的热情和凌云壮志是可以理解的，是十分可贵的，这是我们能够在一个不太长的历史时期内把我国建设成一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家的根本保证。但是，正如党的八届六中全会决议所指出的，“群众的干劲越大，党越要关心群众生活”。劳逸结合是一种积极的措施。因为只有这样，才能使劳动者消除疲劳，恢复体力，才能人强马壮、精力充沛地投入新的劳动。有许多公社规定了男社员每月休假两天，女社员休假四天的制度，这是很好的，应该普遍推广实行。另外也有许多公社采取了很多有效措施，注意卫生，防治疾病，十分重视对妇女劳动的特殊保护，这也是很好的，也应该普遍推广实行。除了推广这些行之有效的经验以外，我们认为，应该根据农业生产的季节性的特点，在冬季更应该有意识地使社员多休息一些，特别是今年遭受严重灾害的地区，更应该如此。
    生产关系和生产力是我国农村人民公社进一步巩固和发展的两个关键问题，也是我国农业更快更好跃进的两个关键问题，认真细致地总结这方面的经验，并根据这些经验，制定出必要的规章制度，是加强公社建设，争取明年农业大丰收的有力保证。
