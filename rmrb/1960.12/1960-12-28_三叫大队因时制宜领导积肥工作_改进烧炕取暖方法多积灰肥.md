The Sanjiao Brigade of Tangjiabo Commune in Qixia County, Shandong Province, relying on the masses and summarizing experience, is seizing the favorable opportunity of winter heating to accumulate ash fertilizer in a big way, creating conditions for winning a bumper harvest next year. By early December, they had accumulated more than 117,000 jin of dry ash.

The General Party Branch of the Sanjiao Production Brigade recently convened more than 60 experienced old farmers to discuss specific methods and measures for accumulating fertilizer in large quantities during the deep winter freezing period in different areas. During the discussions, the general experience of utilizing the favorable conditions of household heating in previous years to accumulate dry ash in large quantities in preparation for topdressing crops such as wheat and sweet potatoes to achieve increased production was summarized. They also exchanged five specific methods that can both improve the efficiency of firewood heating and accumulate more dry ash: (1) Every morning, after removing the dry ash from the bottom of the pot, add a shovel of dry soil. Through burning and stirring, it can be completely burned through. This not only increases the amount of dry ash, but also because the heated soil has a stronger heat retention capacity than grass ash, making the kang (platform bed) warm all day long; (2) After stopping the fire after dinner, you can fill the bottom of the pot with chopped grass clippings mixed with a small amount of soil. The chopped grass clippings burn slowly and do not go out all night, which warms the kang and accumulates more dry ash; (3) For kangs that are heated but not used for cooking, you can first pile up some grass soil (about 60%-70% grass and 30%-40% soil) before burning, and then fill it with chopped grass. Light the fire before dinner, and it will not be cold all night, which also greatly increases the amount of dry ash; (4) If there are not enough chopped grass clippings, you can fill the bottom of the pot with cow dung and cover the surface with a layer of dry soil. This not only does not affect the burning of cow dung for heating, but also burns the raw soil thoroughly; (5) In order to accumulate more fertilizer, you can use soil mixed with a small amount of chopped grass to make soil bricks and soil balls, and bake them in the pot while cooking. A batch can be baked through in about two days. According to the experience of old farmer Xu Dehai, more than ten jin can be baked every five days, and the fertilizer effect is similar to that of dry ash.

The specific methods for heating and accumulating ash were summarized and were very popular among the masses. On this basis, the General Party Branch led the masses to formulate methods such as "assigning tasks to households based on the number of people, basic remuneration plus rewards, members ensuring quality and quantity, and teams paying cash monthly."

After the autumn harvest, this brigade immediately adopted various methods to encourage members to collect burnt grass during early mornings, evenings, and holidays. By early December, each household had stored an average of 2,000 jin of firewood. While organizing grass collection, each team also uniformly arranged labor to move more than 7,000 loads of soil for household fertilizer accumulation for the members. In addition, in order to facilitate the accumulation of dry ash by members, in addition to assigning special personnel to collect it, each team also compiled a batch of ash baskets for the members, so that every household has ash baskets (jars) and every team has ash barns. These preparations created conditions for carrying out the accumulation of ash fertilizer in the deep winter.

After the specific methods for accumulating ash fertilizer in large quantities were established, the broad masses of members actively participated in this activity. Old member Liu Zuobao said: "These methods are really thoughtful. There is more ash, the kang is hotter, and it saves grass. Every household can increase their income, which is really a win-win situation." In the past, no one wanted the broken grass on the edge of the field, but now everyone is collecting it. In order to accumulate more ash fertilizer, many members have also designated special personnel in their families. In the entire brigade, from December 1st to 10th alone, 60,000 jin of dry ash were accumulated, with an average of more than eleven jin per household per day, reaching over-quota for every household.

At present, the commune Party committee has comprehensively promoted the experience of this brigade, and a mass ash accumulation movement is unfolding throughout the commune. (Attached pictures)

### 三叫大队因时制宜领导积肥工作  改进烧炕取暖方法多积灰肥

    三叫大队因时制宜领导积肥工作
    改进烧炕取暖方法多积灰肥
    本报讯　山东栖霞县唐家泊公社三叫大队，依靠群众，总结经验，抓紧冬季取暖的有利时机，大积灰肥，为争取明年丰收创造条件；到12月上旬，已积干灰十一万七千多斤。
    三叫生产大队党总支，最近召集六十多名有经验的老农，分片座谈了在深冬封冻期间，大积肥料的具体办法和措施。座谈中普遍总结了往年利用家庭取暖的有利条件，大积干灰，为小麦甘薯等作物准备追肥，获得增产的经验。并交流了既能提高柴草取暖效率，又能多积干灰的这样五种具体办法：（1）每天早晨将锅底干灰取出后，填上一锨干土，通过烧火搅拌，可全部烧透。这样不仅增加了干灰，而且由于烧热的土比草灰保温力强，使炕整日温暖；（2）晚饭停火后，可在锅底填上带有少量泥土的碎草末，碎草末慢慢燃烧，通夜不熄，既暖了炕，又多积了干灰；（3）不烧饭取暖的炕，可在烧炕前，先堆一些草土（草约占60％—70％，土占30％—40％），而后再填碎草，晚饭前点火，通夜不凉，也大大增加干灰数量；（4）碎草末不足用，可在锅底填牛粪，表面盖一层干土。这样既不影响牛粪燃烧取暖，也将生土烧透；（5）为了多积肥，可用土掺上少许碎草做成土坯、土球，烧饭时放在锅灶里烘烤，两天左右可烤透一批。据老农徐得海的经验，每五天可烤十斤以上，肥效与干灰差不多。
    取暖积灰的具体办法总结出来，很受群众欢迎。在这一基础上，党总支领导群众制定了“按人分户定任务，基本报酬加奖励，社员保质保量，小队按月付现金”等办法。
    这个队在秋收结束后，即采取各种办法，推动社员利用早晚和放假空隙收拾烧草。至12月上旬，每户社员平均收储了柴草两千斤。组织拾草的同时，各小队还统一安排劳力，为社员搬下了家庭积肥用土七千多驮。另外，各小队为便于社员积干灰，除确定专人收集外，还为社员编制了一部分盛灰筐，达到家家有灰筐（缸），队队有灰囤。这些准备工作为开展深冬大积灰肥创造了条件。
    大积灰肥的具体办法订了以后，广大社员积极投入了这项活动。老社员刘作保说：“这些办法真周到，灰多、炕热还省草，户户都能增加收入，真是一举三得。”过去场边碎草无人要，现在人人收拾。为了多积灰肥，许多社员还在家庭成员中指定了专人。全大队仅12月1日至10日十天，即积干灰六万斤，每户每天平均十一斤多，达到户户超额。
    目前，公社党委已全面推广了这个大队的经验，一个群众性的积干灰运动，正在全社展开。（附图片）
