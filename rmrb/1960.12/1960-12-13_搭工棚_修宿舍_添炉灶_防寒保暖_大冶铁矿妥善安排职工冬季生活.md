　　Daye Iron Mine Properly Arranges Winter Life for Workers

　　(Reported by our newspaper) The Daye Iron Mine Party Committee of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation is firmly grasping the work of preventing cold and keeping warm, comprehensively arranging the winter life of workers, and ensuring the sustained leap forward of winter production in the mine.

　　At the beginning of September, the Party committee convened a cold prevention work conference attended by heads of various workshops and relevant personnel, and deployed the cold prevention and freeze-proofing work. Subsequently, six cold prevention and warmth-keeping systems and ten measures were formulated. A special inspection team, headed by Deputy Mine Director Liu Qing, was formed to conduct comprehensive inspections of mines, workshops, and teams. While inspecting, measures were taken. At present, the doors and window glass of most factory buildings have been basically repaired, and the doors and windows of electric shovel cabs on the mountain have been repaired. Most of the water pipes and power lines have been wrapped and repaired. They also built more than 100 square meters of shelters on the mountain for open-air workers to rest and keep warm. In order to arrange the winter life of the workers, party committee secretaries, mine directors, and other leaders at all levels went to the shelters and workers' dormitories on the mountain to understand the needs of the workers. They organized repair teams to universally reinforce, add to, and repair drafty places in shelters and dormitories. Cotton clothes for high-altitude workers and workers in more than ten special jobs have been promptly distributed to the workers. In order to ensure that workers on the mountain can eat hot meals and hot food in winter, canteens have been added on the mountain, and special steaming services are provided for workers who bring their own meals. The mine has also prepared stoves and other heating equipment for the workers, and sent special personnel to purchase bedding straw for the workers to ensure that they spend the winter warmly.

　　The workers are all actively taking action to do a good job in preventing cold and keeping warm. Everyone uses their spare time to cut back a large number of wild grasses to wrap more than 400 meters of water pipes; shelters are built on the mountain, and glass is installed, making every effort to use old waste materials, saving funds for the country.

    大冶铁矿妥善安排职工冬季生活
    本报讯　武汉钢铁公司大冶铁矿党委狠抓防寒保暖工作，全面安排职工冬季生活，保证矿山冬季生产持续跃进。
    9月初，党委就召开各车间负责人和有关人员参加的防寒工作会议，布置了防寒防冻工作。接着，制订出六项防寒保暖制度和十项措施，并以副矿长刘清为首，组成专门检查组，到矿山、车间和班组全面检查。一边检查，一边采取措施。目前，大部分厂房的门窗玻璃都基本上检修完毕，山上的电铲驾驶室的门窗等都修补了，水管和动力线路，大部分已经包扎、检修。他们还在山上搭盖了一百多平方米的工棚，供露天作业工人休息取暖。为了安排好职工的冬季生活，党委书记、矿长等各级领导干部到山上的工棚和工人宿舍，了解了职工的需要。他们组织修缮队对工棚、宿舍普遍加固，加盖，修补漏风的地方。高空作业工人和十多个特殊工种工人的棉衣已经及时发到工人手里。为了保证山上职工在冬季吃上热菜、热饭，在山上增建了食堂，并为自己带饭的职工专门蒸饭。矿里还为职工准备了火炉和其他取暖设备，并派专人为职工购买床铺草，保证职工暖和地度过冬天。
    职工们都积极动手，作好防寒保暖工作。大家利用业余时间割回了大批野草，包扎了四百多米长的水管子；山上搭盖工棚，安装玻璃，尽量利用旧废料，为国家节约了资金。
