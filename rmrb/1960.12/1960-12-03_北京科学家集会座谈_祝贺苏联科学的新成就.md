Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 2nd: The good news of the successful launch of the third Soviet spaceship has, like the previous successful launches of space vehicles, excited the scientists here even more. They sincerely congratulate the Soviet Union on this new great scientific achievement.

More than a dozen relevant scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing held a symposium tonight specifically for this purpose. The symposium was presided over by Wu Youxun, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and physicist. Wu Youxun said that within this short period of six months, the Soviet Union has successfully launched three spaceships, which shows that under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and the government, Soviet scientists, engineers, designers, and workers have made another great achievement in conquering outer space for the noble purpose of human happiness and progress. Wu Youxun said that the low perigee of this Soviet spaceship will obtain more and more valuable scientific data about this part of space for human space flight and safe return to Earth in the near future.

Zhao Jiuzhang, Director of the Institute of Geophysics, said that space flight needs to solve two main problems: one is entering orbit, and the other is safely returning to Earth. In the past, Soviet scientists discovered the existence of inner and outer radiation belts from observations of satellites and space rockets, which made us know that when humans enter space flight, they need to fly from the airspace near the North and South Poles to avoid this radiation belt. The launch of this spaceship will definitely obtain other more important data needed for human safe flight. Regarding the problem of returning to Earth, since the height of the perigee of this spaceship is relatively low, if it is to land, it is expected that the landing point may be more accurate than the previous spaceship. Zhao Jiuzhang said that in the past, there were more reliable density measurements in the high altitude below 100 kilometers and above 200 kilometers from the Earth, but the density measurement in the section from 100 kilometers above to 200 kilometers below is very unreliable. The height of this spaceship is in this section, so it may accurately measure the atmospheric density in this section, which is very meaningful for the braking problem when the spaceship returns to the atmosphere. In addition, X-rays and ultraviolet rays are very strong in this section of space, and these rays have a great impact on living things. This spaceship will definitely be able to obtain very meaningful detection results for these physical phenomena.

Guo Yonghuai, Deputy Director of the Institute of Mechanics, believes that the purpose of the Soviet Union's launch of this spaceship is to investigate space physics problems, which is of great importance to future human space flight. The launch of this spaceship is a successful test of the progress of Soviet space flight technology. There are two problems to be solved when the spaceship returns to Earth: one is the problem of not being burned, which has been solved in the past, but it is expected that there will be more progress this time; the other problem is the accuracy of the landing point. The error of the landing point of the second spaceship is already very small. If this spaceship also lands, it may greatly improve the accuracy. He said that these achievements bring human space flight closer to reality.

Hua Luogeng, Director of the Institute of Mathematics, enthusiastically hailed this great achievement of the Soviet Union at the symposium. He said that he was not only happy for the great achievements of the Soviet Union, but also felt that it was even more necessary to learn science and technology from the Soviet Union.

Yan Jici, Director of the Department of Technological Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and physicist, said that judging from the achievements of the Soviet space ship, the problem of people entering space and returning to Earth has been basically solved. The current experiment is to ensure the safety of people living in space. This experiment shows that another step has been taken in making people enter space.

Lin Rong, Deputy Director of the Department of Biological Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and botanist, pointed out that the launch of the third Soviet spaceship has great significance for the research of space biology. It can not only solve many problems related to human life in space, but also help expand the scope of human activities to beyond the Earth in the future. This spaceship, carrying several kinds of living things, will play a great role in clarifying whether living things will mutate after returning to Earth after space flight, as well as in the evolution of living things.

Chen Shixiang, Director of the Institute of Entomology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that there are many kinds of insects on the earth, with a wide range of life and strong adaptability, which is of great value for the study of ecology, physiology and genetic variation. The third Soviet spaceship carries insects, which shows that Soviet scientists will obtain more materials on the living conditions of organisms under high-altitude space conditions.

Ye Duzheng, a researcher at the Institute of Geophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, pointed out that the launch of this spaceship has taken another step towards realizing the great ideal of advancing meteorology to other planets. He said that as a meteorologist, he was very happy to see the successful launch of the third Soviet satellite spaceship.

### 北京科学家集会座谈  祝贺苏联科学的新成就

    北京科学家集会座谈
    祝贺苏联科学的新成就
    新华社北京2日讯　苏联第三个宇宙飞船发射成功的喜讯传来以后，正像过去各次发射成功宇宙飞行器一样，一次甚于一次地振奋了此间的科学家们。他们衷心地祝贺苏联这一新的伟大科学成就。
    中国科学院在北京的十多位有关科学家今晚特地为此举行了座谈会。座谈会由中国科学院副院长、物理学家吴有训主持。吴有训说，在这短短的半年之内，苏联成功地发射了三个宇宙飞船，这说明苏联科学家、工程师、设计师和工人们在苏联共产党和政府的领导下，为了人类的幸福、进步这个崇高目的，在征服宇宙空间方面作出的又一次伟大的成就。吴有训说，苏联这个飞船的近地点较低，必将为不久人类进行宇宙飞行和安全返回地面获得关于这一部分空间的更多更宝贵的科学数据。
    地球物理研究所所长赵九章说，宇宙飞行要解决两个主要问题：一是进入轨道；一是安全返回地面。以前苏联科学家从卫星和宇宙火箭的观测中发现了内外辐射带的存在，这就使我们知道在人类进入宇宙飞行时需要从南北极附近上空飞上去，避开这个辐射带。这次飞船的发射，一定会获得人类安全飞行所需要的其他更重要的资料；关于重返大地问题，这个飞船由于近地点的高度较低，所以如果要它降落的话，可以预计着陆点可能会比上一个飞船更准确。赵九章说，距地球一百公里以下和二百公里以上的高空，过去已有了比较可靠的密度测量，而在一百公里以上到二百公里以下这一段的密度测量很不可靠，这次飞船的高度在这一段，就可能正确地测定这一段的大气密度，这对于飞船重返大气时的制动问题是很有意义的。此外，这一段空间爱克斯射线和紫外线很强，这些射线对生物影响很大，这个飞船对于这些物理现象也一定可以得到很有意义的探测结果。
    力学研究所副所长郭永怀认为，苏联发射这个飞船的目的在于空间物理问题的考察，这对于将来人类进行宇宙飞行有重要的关系；这次飞船的发射，是苏联宇宙飞行技术进步的一次成功的测验，飞船返回地面所要解决的有两个问题，一是不烧毁的问题，这问题过去已解决，但这次可以预计将更有进步；另一个问题是降落地点的准确度，第二个飞船着陆点的误差已很小，这个飞船假如也降落的话，可能会更大地提高准确度。他说，这些成就使人类进行宇宙飞行更接近现实。
    数学研究所所长华罗庚在座谈会上热情地欢呼苏联这一伟大的成就。他说他不但为苏联的伟大成就感到高兴，而且感到更加需要向苏联学习科学技术。
    中国科学院技术科学部主任、物理学家严济慈说，从苏联宇宙飞船的成就看来，现在人进入宇宙空间并返回地面的问题，基本上已经解决了。目前的试验是为了保证人在宇宙中生活的安全。这一试验说明，在使人进入宇宙空间方面又前进了一步。
    中国科学院生物学部副主任、植物学家林镕指出，苏联第三个宇宙飞船上天，对宇宙生物学的研究，也有巨大意义。它不仅可以解决人在宇宙空间中生活有关的许多问题，也有助于使将来人的活动范围扩大到地球以外。这个载有若干种生物的宇宙飞船，对于阐明生物经过宇宙飞行回到地面以后会不会发生变异，以及生物进化等问题，将有很大的作用。
    中国科学院昆虫研究所所长陈世骧说，地球上昆虫种类很多，生活范围很广，适应能力很强，对研究生态学、生理学和遗传变异有重要价值。苏联第三个宇宙飞船载有昆虫，这表明，苏联科学家将获得生物在高空宇宙条件下生活情况的更多材料。
    中国科学院地球物理研究所研究员叶笃正指出，这一飞船上天，对于实现把气象学推进到其它星球上去这个伟大理想又进了一步。他说，作为气象学家，他很高兴看到苏联第三个卫星式飞船的发射成功。
