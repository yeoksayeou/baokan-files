    Tempered into Steel
    Song Guiying, Leader of the "Five Heroines" Youth Shock Brigade, Xiguan Production Team, Chengguan Commune, Xian County, Hebei

    I used to hear people say, "Flowers grown in a greenhouse can't withstand wind and frost." I didn't fully understand that saying at the time. It was only after two years of transforming low-yield fields that I truly understood it. It also made me realize that the younger you are, the less you should avoid difficulties and hardships. You should consciously meet difficulties head-on and dare to struggle against them. Without hardship, there is no happiness; those who have not suffered do not know what happiness is and cannot withstand the test of difficulties. If you can't stand a little wind and frost, how can you strive for true happiness!

    Our Xiguan Production Team used to be a notoriously poor village in Xian County. Not only was there a shortage of labor and weak animal power, but over 1,100 mu of the team's 1,500 mu of land were "pockmarked" saline-alkali lands. In the past, even in good years, a year's work was only enough to eat for half a year. The old folks often said, "Poverty is rooted in this saline-alkali land. If you're capable, don't eat this rice in Xiguan." During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, we were still short of grain. In the autumn of that year, shortly after the establishment of the People's Commune, some people suggested dividing Xiguan among other production teams, with each team taking dozens of households, fearing that our team would drag them down. People have faces, trees have bark, and the poor should have the ambition to overcome poverty. We can't rely solely on others to change our backwardness; we have to do it ourselves. The Party Branch issued a call to all commune members to transform saline-alkali land into fertile fields, transform grain shortage into surplus, and completely change our backward state. At that time, I was the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch. After discussing it with the members, they all expressed their willingness to actively respond to the Party's call. The deputy secretary of the League branch, Ge Xiuying, and League members Ge Suying, Ge Guiying, Dong Xiuying, and I formed a youth shock brigade, with me and Ge Xiuying serving as the captain and deputy captain, respectively. We expressed our determination to the Party Branch. The Party Branch was very supportive and allocated us 76 mu of saline-alkali land, and also named us the "Five Heroines" Youth Shock Brigade.

    Two years have passed, and we have transformed a total of 374 mu of saline-alkali land. "Skill is honed, and iron is forged," that saying is absolutely true. Overcoming one point of difficulty increases one point of ambition, strength, and wisdom. You must not let the work control you; otherwise, you will never be able to do agriculture well. Take deep plowing and leveling the land, for example. This was the first shot in transforming the saline-alkali land. Without deep plowing, we couldn't expose the soil to the sun to improve it; without leveling the land, we couldn't create garden fields for irrigation and leaching out the alkali. In the autumn of 1958, we decided to plant 50 mu of alkali land with winter wheat. On the first day, the five of us plowed an average of 0.44 mu each. On the second day, we plowed 0.49 mu each, and on the third day, it increased to 0.58 mu, and we didn't feel as tired. By the fifth day, each person reached more than 0.7 mu. The Party Branch Secretary, fearing that we would overwork ourselves, organized more than 20 young men to support us. Together, we completed the deep plowing and leveling of the 50 mu of land in seven days. Although it only took a few days, the agricultural work of deep plowing no longer frightened us. In 1959 and this year, we deep-plowed another 324 mu. Now, one person can plow at least 0.8 or 0.9 mu a day.

    The struggle against natural disasters is also a test and training for us. In 1959, just as the 24 mu of Da Mayazi corn were growing large cobs, a strong wind and rain knocked them all down. The five of us ran to the fields before the rain stopped, propped them up one by one, and added soil. This year, there was no reduction in yield. This further strengthened our determination to fight against natural disasters. In July of this year, excessive rainfall flooded all 200 mu of corn. The water was 1.5 chi deep in some places and half a chi deep in others. Dikes and ditches only drained more than 130 mu of the accumulated water. Then, we scooped out more than 40 mu with water dippers. The remaining 20-plus mu were patches of accumulated water that couldn't be diverted or drained, and were soaked for three consecutive days. Some of the corn stalks turned yellow. What to do? The five of us, guarding this dark and sturdy corn, stamped our feet in anxiety and couldn't think of a solution for a while. Ge Xiuying said anxiously, "If there's a wind, the ones soaked in water will all be blown down. We have to learn from the lesson of 1959!" My heart was anxious, thinking: last year, we propped up 24 mu of corn one by one, and that's how we ensured the harvest. This year's corn was planted by carrying water bucket by bucket during the drought. If we can carry water to plant, can't we carry water to drain? I discussed it with everyone, and they all said my idea was good. But only four of the five of us came, and Deputy Captain Ge Xiuying was missing. At this time, we heard the sound of scooping water into buckets in the cornfield. When we went to look, ah, Ge Xiuying was scooping water into a bucket with a ladle. We all thought of the same thing. Everyone ran home, each carrying a pair of water buckets, and drained the accumulated water from the 20-plus mu of land. Strangely enough, no one felt tired at the time, as if they had taken a power pill. Afterwards, after calculating the work done, we realized that normally we couldn't have done that much work in two days what we had managed to do in one. We discussed it one after another. Some said, "Strength grows the more you work it." Others said, "Not only has our strength grown, but also our confidence in overcoming difficulties. We're not afraid of any difficulties in the future." In this way, we conquered the worst drought in eighty years in the spring and tamed the great flood disaster in the autumn, ensuring a bumper harvest.

    Iron can be forged into all kinds of ironware, and people can also develop all kinds of skills. Transforming saline-alkali land requires the application of organic fertilizer, but our village has weak animal power, and transportation is a big problem. I discussed it with the team members, and they all said we couldn't compete with the production team for livestock. Since 1958, we have been using rubber-wheeled carts to transport manure and haul crops, no less than hundreds of thousands of jin that year. After hauling like this for two years, we have all mastered the skill of pulling rubber-wheeled carts. We used rubber-wheeled carts to transport fertilizer to the saline-alkali land.

    We have transformed a total of 374 mu of saline-alkali land. Last year, the 76 mu yielded an average of 771 jin per mu, and this year, the average yield was 812 jin per mu. Last year, our team not only shed the label of grain shortage but also sold 80,000 jin of grain to the state. If someone asks us what happiness is, we will immediately answer: this is the greatest and truest happiness.

    In the process of transforming saline-alkali land, we have deeply realized that difficulties will always stand in your way, requiring you to exert effort and think of solutions. If you have the courage and confidence to kick it away, it will obediently follow your call like a well-behaved cat. But it's not easy to make it obey you. First of all, you must not be afraid of hardship. Once the difficulty is overcome, you will feel an indescribable joy. Now, all the members of our shock brigade are like little tigers and little artillery shells, strong in body, high in ambition, and great in strength, truly becoming stronger and braver with each battle. In the future, under the leadership of the Party, relying on our own hands, and relying on the spirit of strategically despising difficulties but tactically valuing them in specific battles, we will transform all the saline-alkali land into fertile fields and turn low-yield fields into high-yield fields.

    久炼成钢
    河北献县城关公社西关生产队“五英”青年突击队队长  宋桂英
    过去听人们说过“温室里养出来的鲜花，经不起风霜”。当时对这句话的体会不深。两年来经过改造低产田，我才真正懂得了这句话，也使我认识到：越是年轻人，越不能逃避困难和艰苦。应该自觉地迎着困难闯，敢向困难斗争。没有艰苦，也就没有幸福；没吃过苦的人，也就不知道什么是幸福，就经不起困难的考验。如果受不住一点风吹霜打，哪里还能争取到真正的幸福呢！
    我们西关生产队，原来是献县有名的穷村子，不光劳力少，畜力弱，全队一千五百多亩地就有一千一百多亩是“花狗脸子”盐碱地。过去好年景，干一年才够半年吃的。老人们常说：“穷就穷到这盐碱地上了，有能耐的就别在西关吃这碗饭。”在大跃进的1958年，我们仍然缺粮。这年秋天刚成立人民公社不久，别的生产队怕俺们队拉后腿，就有人主张一个队拉几十户把西关分掉。人有脸，树有皮，穷要有穷志气，改变落后不能光靠别人，非自己动手不行。党支部向全体社员发出了变碱地为良田，变缺粮为余粮，彻底改变落后面貌的号召。当时我是团支部书记，和团员们一商量，都表示要积极响应党的号召。团支部副书记戈秀英、共青团员戈素英、戈桂英、董秀英和我，共五个人组成了一支青年突击队，我和戈秀英分别担任正副队长。我们向党支部表白了决心。党支部对我们很支持，拨给了我们七十六亩盐碱地，还命名我们为“五英”青年突击队。
    两年过去了，我们先后共改造了盐碱地三百七十四亩。“劲是练出来的，铁是打出来的”，这话一点也不假。克服一分困难，就长一分志气，一分力量，一分智慧。非得让人欺住活，不能让活欺住人，不然，是一辈子也干不好农业的。就拿深翻和平整土地来说吧，这是改造盐碱地的头一炮。不深翻就不能晒土改良土壤，不平整土地就不能成园田浇水洗碱。在1958年秋天，俺们决心种五十亩碱地冬小麦。头一天，五个人一个人平均翻四分四厘，第二天，翻了四分九厘，第三天就长到了五分八厘，也不觉着那么累了。五天头上，每人达到了七分多。党支部书记怕我们累坏了，便组织了二十多个小伙子来支援我们，连深翻带平整土地，五十亩地七天就完了。虽说干了几天的时间，可是深翻地这项农活再也吓不住我们了。1959年和今年又深翻了三百二十四亩。现在，一个人一天最少也翻八、九分。
    对自然灾害的斗争也是对我们的考验和锻炼。1959年，二十四亩大马牙玉米刚长出大棒子来，一阵大风大雨刮得全倒伏了。俺们五个人没等住雨就跑到地里，一棵一棵地扶起来，培上土，这一年，一点也没减产。这又一次坚定了我们向自然灾害作斗争的决心。今年7月间，雨水过大，二百亩玉米全被雨水泡起来，深的地方有一尺半，浅的也有半尺，挡埝挖沟仅仅排出了一百三十多亩的积水，接着又用水斗子掏出去了四十多亩，其余的二十多亩是一片片的积水，又不能顺又不能排，连泡三天，有的玉米棵发了黄。怎么办呢？俺们五个人守着这又黑又壮的大玉米，急得直跺脚，一时想不出办法来。戈秀英着急地说：“要是一起风，被水泡的都得刮倒，咱们得接受1959年的教训呀！”我心里像长了草，心想：去年是一棵一棵把二十四亩玉米扶起来的，才保住了丰收。今年这玉米是一桶一桶担水抗旱点种的呀，能担水点种就不能担水排水吗？我和大伙一商量，都说我出的办法行。可是五个人只来了四个，就是没有副队长戈秀英。这时，我们听到玉米地里哗哗啦啦地有往桶里掏水的声音。走去一看，啊，戈秀英正拿瓢往桶里掏水呢，真是都想到一处去了。大家都跑回家去，一人担了一副水桶来，就把二十多亩地的积水担干净了。说也怪，当时谁也不觉累，就像吃了大力丸。事后，一算干的活，在平常真是一天的活两天也干不出来。我们纷纷议论起来，有的说：“劲越练越大。”有的说：“不光劲大了，克服困难的信心也大了，以后什么困难也不怕了。”就这样，我们春季战胜了八十年来未有的大旱，秋季又驯服了大涝灾害，保证了丰收。
    铁能打成各式各样的铁器，人也能练出各种各样的本领。改造盐碱地需要施有机肥，可是俺村畜力弱，运送就是大问题。我和队员们一商量，都说不能和小队争牲口使。从1958年起，我们就是用胶轮车送粪拉庄稼的，那一年也不下几十万斤。这么拉了两年，拉胶轮车这一手也全都练出来了。往盐碱地运送肥料，我们全是用胶轮车拉的。
    我们一共改造了盐碱地三百七十四亩，去年七十六亩平均亩产七百七十一斤，今年平均亩产八百一十二斤。去年我们队不仅摘掉了缺粮帽子，还卖给了国家八万斤粮食。如果有人问我们什么叫做幸福的话，我们会马上回答说：这就是最大的真正的幸福。
    在改造盐碱地中，使我们深深地体会到，困难，时刻都会站在你的面前，需要你出力气，想办法。在这儿，如果你有勇气、有信心把它一脚踢开，它就像听话的小猫一样，乖乖地听从你召唤。可是让它听从你也不是容易的事，首先是不能怕艰苦，等到困难克服了以后，你就会感到有难以形容的愉快。现在我们突击队全体队员个个真像小老虎、小炮弹一样，身体强，志气高，力气大，真是越战越强，越杀越勇。今后，我们要在党的领导下，依靠自己的双手，依靠在战略上藐视困难在具体战役上又重视困难的精神，把所有的盐碱地全部变成良田，把低产田变成高产田。
