    China-Cambodia Friendship Forever Green
    Wang Kunlun
    The Chinese Chao Opera Troupe made a friendly visit and performed in the Kingdom of Cambodia, traveling through nine provinces and cities. Whenever they visited places of interest, they were often asked to write inscriptions before leaving. In haste, they responded with seven-character quatrains, without regard for their superficiality.

  Inscription for the National Museum of Cambodia
    China and Cambodia have been close relatives since ancient times,
    Sharing a brilliant culture, both old and new.
    We are delighted to have the opportunity to admire it together,
    And wish you prosperity that lasts as long as the sun and moon!

    Inscription for the National School of Arts of Cambodia
    Glad to enter the art world for exchange,
    New talents carry on the past and usher in the future.
    Dragon carvings and phoenix embroideries are exquisite,
    A vibrant spring abounds in a riot of colors.

    Inscription for the Soviet-Cambodian Friendship Hospital
    Healing the sick and wounded with a shared heart,
    Friendship is deep, from the north to the south.
    How to forever relieve the suffering of all people,
    And win peace for the world, bringing spring to the world.

    Inscription for the Sihanouk-Zhou Enlai Plywood Factory
    We both admire the high beams and pillars for national construction,
    And are willing to help our friendly neighbor with our modest efforts.
    May people all over the world be glued together firmly,
    So that the edifice of peace will stand forever strong.

    Inscription for the memorial album of Representative Wang Ting, Mayor Ding Dong of Kep City
    Green mountains and blue seas, two hearts are close,
    The scenery of Kep City leaves a deep impression.
    Upon returning, we will surely convey our sincere regards,
    And wish you boundless prosperity and happiness!

    Inscription for the Cambodia-China Friendship Textile Factory
    Performing nightly by the Mekong River,
    We are even happier to see the busy looms.
    Ten thousand threads cannot weave enough,
    The endless affection between our two neighboring countries.

    Impromptu poem at Phnom Penh Airport upon departure
    Reluctant to leave, unable to bear the parting,
    How can we forget this deep affection?
    May the mountains, rivers, and natural beauty remain good forever,
    And may China-Cambodia friendship last for ten thousand years!

    中柬邦交万古青
    王昆仑
    中国潮剧团在柬埔寨王国作友好访问演出，行踪历九个省市，所到参观之处，常于临行时嘱为题词，匆促之间，应以七绝，不及计其粗浅也。
  题柬埔寨国家博物馆中柬由来亲戚邦，古今文化共明昌。此番喜得同瞻仰，心祝繁荣日月长！
    题柬埔寨国家艺术学校喜为交流入艺林，开来继往有新人。雕龙织凤多精湛，万紫千红总是春。
    题柬苏友谊医院疗疾扶伤同此心，北天南海友情深。如何永济苍生苦，赢得和平天下春。
    题西哈努克—周恩来胶合板厂兴邦共仰栋梁高，愿助芳邻尺寸劳。举世人民胶合固，和平大厦永坚牢。
    题王廷驻白马市代表丁东市长纪念册
    青山碧海两情亲，白马风光印象深。
    归去定当传厚意，繁荣幸福祝无垠！
    题柬中友谊纺织厂
    连宵献演傍湄江，更喜来观机杼忙。
    万缕千丝织不尽，绵绵情意两邻邦。
    金边机场告别口占
    临别依依不忍行，何年能忘此深情？
    山川风物期长好，中柬邦交万古青！
