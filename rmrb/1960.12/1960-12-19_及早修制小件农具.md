    Repair and Manufacture Small Farm Tools Early
    When doing any work, it is necessary to grasp the key points. One of the important tasks of county and commune industries this winter is to prepare for agricultural production next year as early as possible. And repairing and manufacturing small farm tools is one of the important keys to preparation work.
    Although small farm tools are simple, they are large in quantity and have many specifications. To produce small farm tools suitable for the needs of different regions is a very detailed task. Practice has proved that going deep into the masses to understand the situation, and then grasping manufacturing on the one hand, and extensively mobilizing commune members to repair farm tools themselves on the other hand, is the mass line working method for repairing and manufacturing small farm tools, and also a method for repairing and manufacturing small farm tools that is more, faster, better, and more economical.
    In the activities of repairing and manufacturing small farm tools, the role of county and commune machinery factories should be fully utilized. All factories, repair shops, and kilns that can produce small farm tools should be mobilized to rush to manufacture and repair small farm tools. The staff and workers of county and commune machinery factories must understand that producing and repairing agricultural machinery is a glorious task to support agricultural technological transformation, and should be grasped tightly; producing small farm tools is also an extremely glorious task, and is indispensable not only under today's conditions, but even after agriculture has achieved mechanized operations. It is necessary to educate the staff and workers of county and commune machinery industries to firmly establish the idea of serving agricultural production, proceed from the actual needs of agricultural production, and actively manufacture small farm tools.

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    及早修制小件农具
    做任何工作都要抓关键。今年冬天县、社工业的重要任务之一，是及早为明年农业生产作好准备。而修理制造小农具，就是准备工作的重要关键之一。
    小件农具虽然简单，但是数量大，规格多，要生产出适合不同地区需要的小农具，是一项很细致的工作。实践证明，深入群众中摸清底，然后一手抓制造，一手广泛发动社员自己动手修补农具，这是修制小件农具的群众路线的工作方法，也是修制小农具的一个多快好省的办法。
    在修制小件农具的活动中，要充分发挥县、社机械工厂的作用。凡是能够生产小件农具的工厂、修配站、烘炉等都要动员起来，赶制和修配小件农具。要使县、社机械工厂的职工懂得：生产修配农业机械是支援农业技术改造的光荣任务，应该抓紧进行；生产小件农具也是极其光荣的任务，不仅在今天的条件下，即是农业实现了机械化操作以后，小件农具都不可缺少。要教育县、社机械工业的职工牢固地树立起为农业生产服务的思想，从农业生产的实际需要出发，积极制造小件农具。
