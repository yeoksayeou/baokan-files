    News in Brief

    "Two-Five System" Leadership Method Arrives in Pastoral Areas
    In the Kezilesu Kirgiz Autonomous Prefecture of Xinjiang, cadres of all ethnic groups have widely implemented the "Fourteen-One System" working method, based on the vastness of the pastoral areas. That is: ten days participating in production, four days studying work and learning, and one day resting with the commune members. The cadres who went deep into the pastoral areas on the vast grasslands, traveled to every pasture to arrange pastures for livestock, and lived with the masses, were called confidant secretaries or livestock-loving captains by the herdsmen.
    
    One Government Cadre Can Do the Work of Many
    After transferring a group of cadres to support the front line of agricultural production, the provincial-level organs in Anhui Province actively improved working methods and increased work efficiency. First, they strengthened work planning and concentrated their efforts on important and urgent work. Some agencies have implemented a system of regular collective office work for leading cadres to solve major problems in their work. Cadres of various agencies have also further promoted the style of going deep into reality and implemented a working method of "getting to the bottom of things." Since July, provincial-level agencies have organized more than 1,000 cadres to conduct investigations and research at the grassroots level. As a result, although the number of people in the organs has decreased, they have still successfully completed various tasks.
    
    Finance and Trade Cadres Stationed in Production Teams
    Finance and trade cadres of Shuangmiao Commune in Ningcheng County, Inner Mongolia, adopted the "Five-Five System" and "Three-Seven System" working methods, spending most of their time stationed in production teams, except for a small amount of time working in the office. In the production teams, they participated in labor and organized production and life. In recent months, the stationed cadres have helped the canteens store more than 1.3 million jin of fresh and dried vegetables, and at the same time, they have increased income for the commune and commodities for the market through organizing production, completing the procurement tasks of various products more than 50 days ahead of schedule.
    
    On-Site Teaching Trains Grassroots Cadres
    The Party School of the Huangpi County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Hubei Province has achieved good results by adopting the form of on-site teaching to train branch backbone members. For each training session, they first organized students to visit red-flag branches, learning advanced experience through observation, lectures, and debates; at the same time, they went to backward branches to visit and labor, helping to find the reasons for backwardness. Through these specific examples, the students not only improved their ideological understanding, but also learned working methods and changed their working styles.
    
    "Sweet Potato Investigation Team" Offers Advice
    Scientific and technical personnel from the Beijing Agricultural Research Institute and Beijing Agricultural University and other units formed a "Sweet Potato Investigation Team" to go to Pinggu, Shunyi, Chaoyang and other counties and districts in the suburbs of Beijing to investigate the storage of sweet potatoes, summarize the sweet potato storage experience of veteran farmers, and offer advice, working with commune members to study reasonable sweet potato storage measures to ensure that seed potatoes can safely overwinter and strive to produce more sweet potatoes next year.
    
    Libraries Go to the Countryside to Lend Books
    Staff members of the Xiaoshan County Library in Zhejiang Province actively serve agricultural production. Recently, they selected nearly 2,000 popular books such as "Questions and Answers on the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," "Vegetable High-Yield Experience," "Wheat High-Yield Experience," and "Rapeseed Production Increase Technology," and sent them in batches to the clubs of various production teams for commune members to read.

    要闻快报
    “二五制”领导方法到了牧区
    新疆克孜勒苏柯尔克孜自治州的各族干部，根据牧区地区辽阔的特点，普遍推行了“十四一制”的工作方法。即：十天参加生产，四天研究工作和学习，一天和社员一块休息。深入在千里草原上的牧区干部，踏遍各个牧场，为牲畜安排草场，和群众一块生活，被牧民称为知心书记或爱畜队长。
    机关干部一人顶多人
    安徽省省级机关，在抽调一批干部支援农业生产第一线后，积极改进工作方法，提高工作效率。他们首先加强了工作计划性，集中精力做好重要的和急需办的工作。有些机关实行了领导干部定期集体办公制度，解决工作中的重大问题。各机关干部，还进一步发扬深入实际的作风，实行一竿子插到底的工作方法。七月份以来，省级机关先后组织了一千多名干部，深入基层调查研究。这样，机关的人数虽有减少，但仍顺利地完成了各项任务。
    财贸干部驻队办公
    内蒙古宁城县双庙公社财贸干部，分别采取“五五制”和“三七制”的工作方法，除了少数时间在机关工作外，大部时间驻队办公。在生产队里，他们既参加劳动，又组织生产和生活。几个月来，驻队干部帮助食堂贮存鲜菜、干菜一百三十多万斤，同时通过组织生产，为公社增加了收入，给市场增加了商品，提前五十多天完成了各种产品的收购任务。
    现场教学训练基层干部
    中共湖北黄陂县委党校，采取现场教学的形式，训练支部骨干分子，取得良好效果。每期训练时，都先组织学员参观红旗支部，通过看、讲、辩的方法，学习先进经验；同时到后进支部去参观、劳动，帮助寻找落后的原因。学员通过这些具体事例，不但提高了思想觉悟，也学会了工作方法，转变了工作作风。
    “白薯考察团”出谋划策
    北京市农业研究所和北京农业大学等单位的科学技术人员，组成“白薯考察团”，分别到京郊的平谷、顺义和朝阳等县、区，一方面考察白薯的贮藏情况，总结老农的贮薯经验；一方面出谋划策，和社员一起研究合理贮薯措施，使种薯能够安全越冬，争取明年增产更多的白薯。
    图书馆下乡出借书籍
    浙江省萧山县图书馆工作人员，积极为农业生产服务。最近，他们挑选了“农业八字宪法问答”、“蔬菜丰产经验”、“小麦高额丰产经验”、“油菜增产技术”等通俗读物近二千册，分批送到各个生产队的俱乐部，借给社员阅读。
