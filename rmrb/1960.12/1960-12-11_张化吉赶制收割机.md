    Zhang Huaji Rushes to Produce Harvesters
    This autumn, just when the vast rural areas urgently needed a large number of harvesters to harvest the autumn crops, the production of combine harvesters at the Siping Agricultural Machinery Factory encountered many difficulties. For example, manufacturing qualified springs was the most important hurdle in the factory's production of harvesters. Zhang Huaji, the leader of the youth forging team in the factory, racked his brains day and night to find a way to overcome this key problem in order to support agricultural production. Although he didn't come up with a good way to manufacture qualified springs, he thought: difficulties are like springs, if you are soft, it will be hard, and if you are hard, it will be soft. So at the "breakthrough" meeting, he took the lead and resolutely took on the task of manufacturing springs. They started immediately, and they produced springs by hand that day, but manual production was both laborious and inefficient, and could not meet the needs. Later, after pondering for half the night, Zhang Huaji made a winch out of wood to replace manual labor in processing springs. Manpower was saved, but the efficiency was still not high. At this time, the director of the workshop brought back a blueprint for a spring machine tool from Taiyuan. Zhang Huaji immediately convened a meeting of the team to study the manufacture of a spring machine. They worked overnight, drew several sketches, and after repeated research, they changed the original design of more than two hundred parts into nineteen parts. They made the first spring machine tool. In this way, more than 1,100 springs could be produced per shift, which met the production needs, enabled the factory's combine harvester production plan to be successfully completed, and supported the autumn harvest production in a timely manner.

    张化吉赶制收割机
    今年秋季，正当广大农村急需大批收割机收秋的时候，四平市农业机械厂联合收割机的生产，却遇到了不少困难问题。如制造合格的弹簧，是这个厂生产收割机中最主要的一个难关。该厂青年锻工组组长张化吉，为了支援农业生产，正日思夜想地找窍门攻破这个关键。他虽然没有想出制造合格弹簧的好办法，但他想：困难恰像弹簧，你软它就硬、你硬它就软。于是在“破关”会上，他一马当先，坚决领下了制造弹簧的任务。说干就干，他们当天就用手工生产出了弹簧，可是用手工生产既费力，效率又低，不能满足需要。后来，张化吉经过半宿琢磨，用木料做了一个绞关机代替人拉加工弹簧。人力是省了，就是效率还不高。正在这时，车间主任从太原带回来一份弹簧机床图纸。张化吉立刻召集小组开会研究制造弹簧机。他们突击了一夜，画出好几张草图，又经过反复研究，将原设计的二百多个部件，改成十九个部件。他们制出了第一台弹簧机床。这样，每班可产弹簧一千一百多个，满足了生产需要，使全厂联合收割机的生产计划顺利地完成了，并及时支援了秋收生产。
