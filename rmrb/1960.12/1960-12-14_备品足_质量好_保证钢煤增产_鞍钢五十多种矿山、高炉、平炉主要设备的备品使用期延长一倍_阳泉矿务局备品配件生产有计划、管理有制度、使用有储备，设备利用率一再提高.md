Sufficient Spare Parts, Good Quality, Guarantee Increased Steel and Coal Production
	Anshan Iron and Steel extends the service life of more than 50 types of spare parts for major equipment in mines, blast furnaces, and open-hearth furnaces by one time.
	Yangquan Mining Bureau's spare parts production is planned, managed with a system, and used with reserves, continuously improving equipment utilization.
	Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, December 13th: The broad masses of workers in the Anshan Iron and Steel machinery system have launched a technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "longevity" of spare parts. To date, after appraisal, the service life of more than 50 types of spare parts for major mechanical equipment in mines, blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, etc., has been extended by more than one time compared with the past.

	The workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Southern Machinery Repair Factory, which supplies spare parts for the equipment of various blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces of Anshan Iron and Steel, launched a technical innovation movement to eliminate "five harms" targeting the defects such as "pits," "flashes," "shrinkage cavities" on the surface of castings and the "swell" produced in the casting process, which affect the service life of castings. In just one month, they significantly improved the quality of more than 20 types of over 1,000 key spare parts, extending their service life by one to three times. The "hot blast ring" manufactured by this factory for the iron-smelting plant used to leak air after three to five days of use, affecting the increased production of the blast furnace. This time, they organized veteran workers, technicians, and Meng Tai, the deputy director of the iron-smelting plant, to conduct joint research, and in less than a week, they developed a new method of using steel instead of copper to cast the "hot blast ring," extending its life by more than twice as long as before.

	In this movement, many workers regarded extending the life of spare parts and accessories as their lofty responsibility. The Zhang Weili group in the steel casting workshop of the Northern Machinery Repair Factory, which specializes in manufacturing steel ladles for open-hearth furnaces, and the Kang Jizhong group, which specializes in manufacturing iron ladles for blast furnaces, launched an attack on the key issue of ladle cracks as soon as the rapid steelmaking movement began. Kang Jizhong led all 13 workers in his group, with the help of Zhao Jia, a technician who was originally a veteran steel casting worker, and spent four consecutive nights to finally solve the problem of ladle cracks. After hearing this news, Zhang Weili led his team members to the Kang Jizhong group to learn on the same night when he started work. As a result, the steel ladles and iron ladles cast by both groups eliminated cracks and their service life was more than doubled compared to the past.

	Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, December 13th: Yangquan Mining Bureau in Shanxi Province is grasping the production of various spare parts and accessories for mining and tunneling machinery to ensure the normal operation of coal mine production. Now, each mine, each pit entrance, and each working face have achieved a regular reserve of spare parts for one month, seven days, and three days respectively, which can meet the needs of electromechanical maintenance in a timely manner. Therefore, the equipment utilization rate has been significantly improved. The overall equipment utilization rate increased from 88% in August to 92.1% in September, then to 94% in October, and reached over 95.5% in November.

	Since the beginning of the increase production and practice economy movement in August, Yangquan Mining Bureau has regarded the production of spare parts and accessories for mining equipment as one of the important measures to ensure production. Each mine established repair and manufacturing headquarters, and made unified adjustments and arrangements for the division of labor in equipment repair and matching work according to the technical strength of each unit. Each unit mobilized the masses to carry out the movement of manufacturing and repairing accessories. The repair and manufacturing and electromechanical departments of each mine have allocated more than 80% of the machine tools and manpower to the manufacture of spare parts and accessories, and transferred some technical force to go deep into the pits, teams, and working faces to repair and inspect equipment, and send various spare parts and accessories to the pit entrance, ensuring that whatever is needed on the front line is available. From August to now, the bureau has manufactured a total of 507 tons of various spare parts and accessories, which is more than 21% more than the total in the first half of the year. Due to the timely supply of accessories, the bureau has repaired more than 1,200 sets of various machines and equipment, and 45,814 meters of chutes and large chains. At the same time, each mine, each pit entrance, and each working face have reserved a certain amount of spare parts and accessories, changing the past phenomenon of temporary supply of accessories from the surface.

	The bureau listed commonly used equipment accessories as the focus of accessory production, concentrated repair machine forces, and carried out intensive production in batches and phases.

	Yangquan Mining Bureau also attaches great importance to the management of spare parts and accessories. Since August, the bureau has conducted a major inspection of equipment, clarified the needs of spare parts and accessories, and arranged production plans accordingly. The entire mine determined that the director would host a meeting of each pit's ordering needs in the middle of each month to arrange the manufacturing plan for accessories for the next month, and then review it again at the beginning of the next month to achieve "accurate ordering and timely supply." In addition, it is stipulated that a safety activity day is held every week to mobilize the masses to inspect and maintain equipment, and calculate the required types and quantities of accessories in order to organize production in a timely manner. The bureau also implemented a three-level management system for spare parts and accessories: each mine guarantees a one-month reserve of spare parts and accessories; each pit has a warehouse for various spare parts and accessories underground, storing seven days of spare accessories; each team and group has a parts box on the working face, storing three days of spare accessories. In this way, the phenomenon of missing parts in the past has been overcome, and the production of spare parts and accessories is planned and managed with a system.

    备品足　质量好　保证钢煤增产
    鞍钢五十多种矿山、高炉、平炉主要设备的备品使用期延长一倍
    阳泉矿务局备品配件生产有计划、管理有制度、使用有储备，设备利用率一再提高
    据新华社鞍山13日电　鞍钢机械系统广大职工，开展以备品“长寿化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，到目前为止，经过鉴定，有五十多种矿山、高炉、平炉等主要机械设备备品的使用寿命，比过去延长一倍以上。
    供应鞍钢各座高炉、平炉设备备品的鞍钢南部机修厂职工，针对铸件表面上的“坑包”、“飞翅”、“缩孔”和在铸造过程中产生的“涨箱”等影响铸件使用寿命的缺陷，开展了除“五害”的技术革新运动。在短短的一个月里，他们就使二十多种一千多件关键备品质量显著提高，使用寿命延长一倍到三倍。这个厂为炼铁厂制造的“热风圈”，过去使用三、五天就漏风，影响高炉增产。这次他们组织了老工人、技术人员和炼铁厂副厂长孟泰，共同研究，不到一个星期就研究出用钢代替铜铸造“热风圈”的新方法，使它的寿命比过去延长两倍以上。
    在这一运动中，很多职工都把延长备品、配件的寿命，当作自己崇高的责任。北部机修厂铸钢车间专门给平炉制造钢水罐的张维礼小组和专门给高炉制造铁水罐的康吉中小组，在快速炼钢运动一开始，就针对大罐裂纹的关键，进行围攻。康吉中领着全组十三名工人，在老铸钢工人出身的技术员赵家的帮助下，一连用四个晚上的时间，终于解决了大罐裂纹问题。张维礼听到这个消息后，当天晚上一上班就领着组员到康吉中小组去学习。结果两个组铸出来的钢水罐和铁水罐，都消灭了裂纹现象，寿命比过去延长一倍多。
    据新华社太原13日电　山西省阳泉矿务局抓紧采掘机具各种备品配件的生产，保证煤矿生产的正常进行。现在，各矿、各坑口和各掌子面已分别做到经常有一个月、七天和三天的配件储备量，可以及时满足机电维修的需要。因此，设备利用率显著提高。全局设备利用率由8月份的88％提高到9月份的92.1％，10月份又提高到94％，到11月份就达到了95.5％以上。
    从8月份开展增产节约运动之初，阳泉矿务局就把生产采掘设备的备品配件作为保证生产的重要措施之一。各矿成立修造指挥部，根据各单位技术力量，对设备修配的分工工作作了统一调整和安排。各单位发动群众开展了制修配件的运动。各矿的修造、机电部门都抽出80％以上的机床和人力从事备品配件的制造，抽调一部分技术力量深入各坑、队、掌子面维修检查设备，将各种备品配件送到坑口，保证了第一线用什么有什么。从8月到现在，全局共制造各种备品配件五百零七吨，比上半年的总和还多21％以上。由于配件供应及时，全局共修复各种机器设备一千二百多台，溜槽、大链四万五千八百十四米。同时，各矿、各坑口和各掌子面都有储备了一定量的备品配件，改变了过去临时由井上供应配件的现象。
    这个局把常用设备配件列为配件生产的重点，集中机修力量，分批分期地突击生产。
    阳泉矿务局还十分重视备品配件的管理工作。8月份以来，全局进行了设备大检查，摸清备品配件的需要情况，据此安排了生产计划。全矿确定每月中旬由局长主持一次各坑要货会议，安排下月配件的制造计划，到下月初再复审一次，做到“订货准确，供货及时”。此外，规定每周举行一次安全活动日，发动群众检查维修设备，计算配件需要品种和数量，以便及时组织生产。全局还实行了备品配件三级管理制度：各矿保证有一个月的备品配件储备；各坑井下设有各种备品配件仓库，保存七天的备用配件；各队、组在掌子面设零件箱，存放三天的备用配件。这样，就克服了过去丢失零件的现象，使配件备品生产有计划，管理有制度。
