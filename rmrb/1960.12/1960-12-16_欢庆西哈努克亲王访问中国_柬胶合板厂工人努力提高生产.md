Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, December 15th: To celebrate Prince Sihanouk's visit to China, Cambodian workers at the Sihanouk-Zhou Enlai Plywood Factory, built with Chinese assistance, are striving to increase the daily production of plywood from five hundred to one thousand sheets.

The factory's deputy director told Xinhua reporters today that, in order to achieve this goal, he recently convened a meeting of all foremen and Chinese experts to exchange experiences in order to find the best way to increase production.

In the spacious workshops of this factory, workers told Xinhua reporters with full confidence that they would be able to increase daily production to one thousand sheets before Prince Sihanouk returns from his visit to China.

The products of this factory are widely welcomed. Prince Sihanouk recently said that the quality of plywood produced by this factory is better than that imported from France.

When Premier Zhou Enlai visited Cambodia in May this year, he visited this factory and was warmly welcomed by the workers.

    柬胶合板厂工人努力提高生产
    新华社金边15日电　中国援助柬埔寨修建的西哈努克—周恩来胶合板工厂的柬埔寨工人正在努力把胶合板的日产量从五百块提高到一千块，用这个行动来表示欢迎西哈努克亲王访问中国。
    这个厂的副厂长今天对新华社记者说，为了实现这个目标，他最近召集了所有工长和中国专家开会，交流经验，以便找出增加产量的最好办法。
    在这家工厂的宽敞的车间里，工人们满怀信心地对新华社记者说，在西哈努克亲王访问中国回来以前，他们能够把日产量增加到一千块。
    这家工厂的产品受到普遍的欢迎。西哈努克亲王最近说，这个工厂生产的胶合板的质量比从法国进口的胶合板好。
    今年5月，周恩来总理访问柬埔寨时，曾经访问了这家工厂，他受到工人们热烈的欢迎。
