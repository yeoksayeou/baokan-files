Xinhua News Agency, 26th. China-Latin America Friendship Association President Chu Tunan's speech at the gathering of people from all walks of life in the capital to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Latin American countries' struggle for national independence and celebrate the 2nd anniversary of the victory of the Cuban Revolution, is as follows: Dear friends from Latin American countries, respected Cuban Ambassador to China, Mr. Oscar Pino Santos, comrades, friends:

Today, we are gathering here with great excitement to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Latin American countries' struggle for national independence and to celebrate the second anniversary of the Cuban people's revolutionary victory. On behalf of the China-Latin America Friendship Association and people from all walks of life in the capital, I would like to extend our highest respect and heartfelt and warm congratulations to the Latin American peoples with glorious revolutionary traditions who have been fighting tenaciously to safeguard national independence and strive for democratic freedom, and to the heroic Cuban people who resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism and hold high the banner of national democratic revolution.

As everyone knows, Latin America is a vast continent with abundant resources and beautiful scenery, with a total area almost twice the size of the entire Europe. There, there are two hundred million hard-working, brave, and peace-loving people. However, from the end of the fifteenth century, Spanish and Portuguese colonialists invaded Latin American countries and carried out deception, plunder, and massacres against the people of Latin American countries, subjecting them to a piratical bloody rule for as long as three hundred years. During these three hundred years, large-scale massacres by colonialists turned the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean red with the blood of Latin American peoples. Cuba and Puerto Rico suffered the most severe killings, with the people here almost completely exterminated in the early years. The most famous Mexico City was also turned into scorched earth and ruins. Greedy colonialists not only seized large amounts of land, transferred the plundered gold, silver, gems and other precious minerals into the national treasuries of Spain and Portugal, but also forced people into slave labor, plunging the people of Latin American countries into a deep abyss of suffering.

The history of three hundred years of colonial rule is also a glorious history of the Latin American people's continuous struggle of resistance. Especially during the period from 1810 to 1825, anti-colonial rule fires were ignited throughout Latin America. After fifteen years of arduous struggle, the Latin American peoples finally drove the old colonialists of Spain, who had occupied Latin America for three hundred years, out of the continent and established their own independent countries. In 1822, the Brazilian people drove the Portuguese colonial rulers out of Latin America.

However, just as the Latin American countries were striving to build their own countries, other European invaders and U.S. imperialism followed in the footsteps of the Spanish and Portuguese colonialists, making the entire Latin America a battleground for old and new colonialists, bringing new disasters to the Latin American peoples. Especially after World War II, U.S. imperialists further exposed their ambition to dominate Latin America. In the nearly 100-year history of its invasion of Latin America, U.S. imperialism has carried out more than 100 armed invasions and interventions against Latin American countries, annexed more than half of Mexico's territory, carried out armed invasions of nine countries in the Caribbean, and occupied Haiti for as long as nineteen years. Through the Panama independence incident, it seized the so-called "permanent lease rights" to the Panama Canal Zone, and still refuses to leave today. In addition, U.S. imperialism has forcibly established military bases on the territories of many Latin American countries, establishing a "chain" of base networks from the Caribbean to Argentina, attempting to tie Latin American countries to the U.S. imperialist war chariot, and has supported military dictatorship regimes in many countries as its agents. These agents are opposed by the people of their own countries, and one after another they have collapsed. The remaining dictators are also teetering. In economic terms, U.S. imperialism has used large-scale capital exports, pouring more than 13 billion U.S. dollars into Latin America, thereby allowing U.S. monopoly capital to control 95% of Chile's copper, 90% of Venezuela's oil, 80% of Mexico's mining industry, and almost all of Central America's fruit production. Through cruel plunder methods such as "buying cheap and selling dear," U.S. imperialism extracts more than 2 billion U.S. dollars of so-called "profits" from the people of Latin American countries every year.

U.S. imperialists are determined to completely turn Latin America into a market for extracting cheap raw materials and labor, and into a strategic base for invading other countries. However, this dream will never be realized. In order to fight for survival and freedom, the Latin American peoples have united, just as they did in the past struggle for national independence against colonialists such as Spain and Portugal, inherited the traditions of Bolivar, San Martin, and Jose Marti, and launched continuous and heroic struggles against U.S. imperialism. In particular, at the beginning of last year, the Cuban people, relying on their own united struggle and the support of the Latin American people and peace-loving people all over the world, overthrew the Batista dictatorial rule, a faithful lackey of U.S. imperialism, and achieved a great victory in the national democratic revolution, thereby pushing the Latin American people's anti-imperialist struggle to a new stage and setting a brilliant example for the struggle of the Latin American countries against U.S. imperialism.

It has now been two years since the victory of the Cuban People's Revolution. Under the leadership of the Cuban Revolutionary Government headed by Prime Minister Castro, the Cuban people have resolutely carried out a series of major measures such as suppressing counter-revolutionaries, implementing land reform, and eliminating the remnants of U.S. imperialist forces, and have achieved great victories. U.S. imperialists are not reconciled to their failure in Cuba and are extremely hostile to the Cuban Revolution. In addition to carrying out a series of subversive activities against Cuba, U.S. imperialism is currently imposing a comprehensive economic blockade and embargo on Cuba, and is constantly sending troops to the Caribbean to intensify armed interference in Cuba. U.S. imperialism also uses the "Organization of American States" it controls to try its best to create divisions between Cuba and other Latin American countries, plotting to use the vicious means of pitting Latin Americans against Latin Americans to undermine the Cuban Revolution and strengthen its control and plunder of other Latin American countries. However, no matter what conspiracies and tricks U.S. imperialism employs, or what two-faced tactics of deception, paralysis, and military threats it plays, the awakened Cuban people and the Latin American peoples will never be deceived or intimidated. On the contrary, it has further aroused the Cuban people's deep hatred and further aroused the Cuban people's high fighting spirit to defend their motherland and defend the revolution. In order to crush the military threats and armed aggression of U.S. imperialism, the Cuban people, under the leadership of Prime Minister Castro and the Cuban Revolutionary Government, have implemented a general mobilization of the entire people. Now, the majestic slogan "Cuba yes, Yankees no!" resounds not only in Cuba but also in Latin American countries. U.S. imperialism wants to launch a general offensive against Cuba and the Latin American peoples through the "Declaration of San Jose" it manufactured, but the Cuban people have given a powerful counterattack with the revolutionary "Declaration of Havana." Now, the Cuban people are confidently advancing by leaps and bounds, holding a gun in one hand and a hoe in the other, to defend the revolution and build their own country. The victory of the Cuban People's Revolution has set a brilliant example for the struggle of the Latin American countries to safeguard national independence and strive for democratic freedom, and has made a great contribution to the struggle of the people of the world against U.S. imperialist aggression and war policies and to defend world peace. Today, the national democratic movement throughout Latin America is developing like a prairie fire. The people of Paraguay, Dominica, and Guatemala have launched huge struggles against U.S. imperialism and dictatorship. The people of Panama are carrying out the struggle to recover sovereignty over the Canal Zone. The people of other Latin American countries are also carrying out struggles to safeguard their own interests, oppose the plunder of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and demand land reform and broad social reforms. These struggles have converged into an irresistible torrent.

The Chinese people have long suffered from the oppression and exploitation of imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism. Even today, U.S. imperialism still occupies our territory of Taiwan and poses a military threat to our country. Therefore, the Chinese people and the people of Latin American countries have always had common demands and interests in the struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and war policies, to safeguard national independence, and to defend world peace. U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese people, the people of Latin American countries, and all peace-loving people in the world. The Chinese people have always regarded the struggles of the Latin American peoples as their own struggles, their victories as their own victories, and believe that every achievement of the Latin American peoples is a powerful support and encouragement to us. The Chinese people will always support the just struggles of the Latin American peoples and regard it as their unshirkable international responsibility.

The current international situation is that the East wind continues to prevail over the West wind, and the socialist forces, national revolutionary forces, and peace and democratic forces are unprecedentedly strong and closely united. Imperialism, on the other hand, is full of contradictions, disintegrating, and rotting away day by day. What appears before us is an excellent situation. This is extremely beneficial to the just struggle of the Latin American peoples to maintain and strive for national independence and for democratic freedom. The Latin American peoples have increasingly seen through from the continuous failures of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys that U.S. imperialism and all reactionaries are nothing more than "paper tigers" that appear strong on the outside but are weak on the inside. At the same time, the Latin American peoples will also find the correct path to get rid of the enslavement and control of U.S. imperialism and achieve complete national liberation from the victory and continuous development of the Cuban Revolution. Of course, the future struggle will still be tortuous, complex, and arduous. U.S. imperialism will continue to employ new conspiracies and tricks. As Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out, "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again... until their doom; that is the logic of the imperialists and all reactionaries the world over in dealing with the cause of the people, and they will never go against this logic." As long as the Latin American peoples strengthen their unity and persist in their struggle, the aggression and war policies of U.S. imperialism will surely fail completely. U.S. imperialism will certainly not escape the shameful path of failure taken by the Spanish and Portuguese colonial rulers in Latin American countries. The just struggle of the Latin American peoples will surely achieve final victory! A new, independent, free, democratic, and happy Latin America will surely be born from the flames of struggle!

Finally, let us shout:

Long live the victory of the Cuban People's Revolution!

Long live the victory of the national and democratic revolution of the Latin American peoples!

Long live the friendly unity between the Chinese and Latin American peoples!

Long live the great unity of the people of the world!

Long live world peace!

    美帝国主义逃不出旧殖民主义的失败道路
    古巴革命胜利为拉丁美洲树立了光辉榜样
    楚图南在首都纪念拉丁美洲争取民族独立一百五十周年和庆祝古巴革命胜利二周年大会上讲话
    新华社26日讯　中国拉丁美洲友好协会会长楚图南在首都各界人民纪念拉丁美洲各国争取民族独立一百五十周年和庆祝古巴革命胜利二周年大会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的拉丁美洲各国朋友们，尊敬的古巴驻中国大使奥斯卡·皮诺·桑托斯先生，同志们，朋友们：
    今天，我们以十分兴奋的心情在这里举行集会，纪念拉丁美洲各国争取民族独立一百五十周年并庆祝古巴人民革命胜利二周年。我谨代表中国—拉丁美洲友好协会和首都各界人民，向有着光荣的革命传统的为维护民族独立、争取民主自由而顽强斗争的拉丁美洲各国人民，向坚决反对美帝国主义、高举着民族民主革命旗帜的英雄的古巴人民，表示崇高的敬意和衷心的热烈的祝贺。
    大家都知道，拉丁美洲是幅员广阔，物产富饶，风景美丽的大陆，它的总面积比整个欧洲差不多大一倍。在那里，有两亿勤劳勇敢和热爱和平的人民。但是，从十五世纪末叶，西班牙和葡萄牙的殖民主义者侵占了拉丁美洲各国并对拉丁美洲各国人民进行欺诈、掠夺和屠杀，海盗般的血腥统治达三百年之久。三百年当中，殖民主义者的大规模屠杀，使拉丁美洲人民的鲜血染红了加勒比海和大西洋。遭受残杀最重的是古巴和波多黎各，这里的人民在最初几年几乎完全被消灭。最著名的墨西哥城也变成了焦土和废墟。贪得无厌的殖民主义者，不仅大量强占土地，将掠夺的金、银、宝石等珍贵矿产，纳入西班牙和葡萄牙的国库，并强使人民作奴役的劳动，使拉丁美洲各国人民深深陷进了苦难的深渊。
    三百年殖民统治的历史，同时也是拉丁美洲人民前仆后继进行反抗斗争的光辉的历史。特别是1810年到1825年期间，全拉丁美洲到处燃起了反抗殖民统治的烽火。拉丁美洲各国人民，经过十五年艰苦战斗，终于将霸占拉丁美洲三百年的老殖民主义者——西班牙赶出了大陆，建立了各自独立的国家。在1822年巴西人民又把葡萄牙殖民统治者从拉丁美洲赶出去。
    可是，当拉丁美洲各国人民正努力建设自己国家的时候，欧洲的另外一些侵略者和美帝国主义又继西班牙和葡萄牙殖民主义者之后接踵而来，使整个拉丁美洲成为新旧殖民主义者的角逐场所，给拉丁美洲各国人民带来新的灾难。特别是第二次世界大战以后，美帝国主义者更加暴露了它想独霸拉丁美洲的野心。美帝国主义在侵入拉丁美洲的近百年历史中，对拉丁美洲各国进行了一百多次武装侵略和干涉，并吞了墨西哥一半以上的领土，对加勒比海九个国家进行了武装侵略，四次出兵古巴，占领海地达十九年之久。通过巴拿马独立事件，攫取了巴拿马运河区的所谓“永久租让权”，直到今天仍赖在那里不走。此外，美帝国主义在拉丁美洲很多国家的领土上强设了军事基地，建立了从加勒比海到阿根廷“锁链式”的基地网，企图把拉丁美洲各国拴在美帝国主义的战车上，并扶持了许多国家的军事独裁政权，作为它的代理人。这些代理人受到本国人民的反对，一个个相继垮台，残存的独裁者也摇摇欲坠了。在经济方面，美帝国主义利用大规模的资本输出，在拉丁美洲倾注了一百三十多亿美元，从而使智利95％的铜、委内瑞拉90％的石油、墨西哥80％的采矿业和几乎全部中美洲的果品生产都控制在美国垄断资本的手中。通过“贱买贵卖”等残酷掠夺手段，美帝国主义每年从拉丁美洲各国人民身上榨取了二十多亿美元的所谓“利润”。
    美帝国主义者一心想把拉丁美洲完全变成它的榨取廉价原料和劳动力的市场，变成侵略其它国家的战略基地。但是，这种梦想是永远不会实现的。为了争生存，争自由，拉丁美洲各国人民像在过去争取民族独立斗争时期反对西班牙、葡萄牙等殖民主义者一样团结起来，继承了博利瓦尔、圣马丁和何塞·马蒂的传统，对美帝国主义展开了持续不断的英勇斗争。特别是去年年初，古巴人民依靠自己的团结斗争，依靠拉丁美洲人民和全世界爱好和平人民的支持，推翻了美帝国主义的忠实走狗巴蒂斯塔独裁统治，取得了民族民主革命的伟大的胜利，从而把拉丁美洲人民反帝斗争推进到一个新的阶段，为拉丁美洲各国人民反对美帝国主义的斗争树立了光辉的榜样。
    古巴人民革命胜利现在已经两周年了。古巴人民在以卡斯特罗总理为首的古巴革命政府领导下，坚决进行了镇压反革命，实行土地改革，清除美帝国主义残余势力等一系列重大措施，并且取得了伟大的胜利。美帝国主义者不甘心它在古巴的失败，极端仇视古巴革命。美帝国主义除对古巴进行一系列的颠复活动以外，目前又对古巴实行全面经济封锁和禁运，并且不断出兵加勒比海，加紧对古巴的武装干涉。美帝国主义还利用它所控制的“美洲国家组织”竭力制造古巴同其它拉丁美洲国家之间的分裂，阴谋用拉丁美洲人打拉丁美洲人的恶毒手段，来破坏古巴革命，并加强它对其它拉丁美洲国家的控制和掠夺。但是，不管美帝国主义施展任何阴谋和诡计，玩弄任何欺骗麻痹和军事威胁的两面手法，已经觉悟了的古巴人民和拉丁美洲各国人民是永远骗不了，吓不倒的。相反，它却更加激起了古巴人民的深刻仇恨，更加激起了古巴人民保卫祖国，保卫革命的昂扬斗志。为了粉碎美帝国主义的军事威胁和武装进攻，古巴人民在卡斯特罗总理和古巴革命政府领导下，实行了全民总动员。现在不仅在古巴也在拉丁美洲各国响彻“要古巴不要美国佬”的雄壮口号。美帝国主义想通过它一手制造的“圣约瑟宣言”对古巴和拉丁美洲各国人民发动总进攻，古巴人民用革命的“哈瓦那宣言”给予有力的回击。现在，古巴人民正满怀信心，一手拿枪，一手握锄，为捍卫革命，为建设自己的祖国而大踏步地前进。古巴人民革命的胜利，已为拉丁美洲各国人民维护民族独立，争取民主自由的斗争树立了光辉的榜样，并且对世界人民反对美帝国主义侵略政策、战争政策，保卫世界和平的斗争作出了巨大的贡献。今天，整个拉丁美洲的民族民主运动正以烈火燎原之势向前发展，巴拉圭、多米尼加、危地马拉人民已掀起巨大的反对美帝、反对独裁的斗争，巴拿马人民正在进行收回运河区主权的斗争，其它拉丁美洲各国人民也正在进行维护本国利益，反对美帝国主义及其走狗掠夺，要求进行土地改革和广泛社会改革的斗争。这些斗争已经汇成了一支势不可挡的洪流。
    中国人民过去曾长期受过帝国主义、特别是美帝国主义的压迫与剥削，直至今天，美帝国主义还霸占着我国领土台湾，对我国进行着军事威胁。因此，中国人民和拉丁美洲各国人民之间，在反对美帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策，维护民族独立以及保卫世界和平斗争中，一向就有着共同的要求和利害关系。美帝国主义是中国人民和拉丁美洲各国人民和全世界和平人民的共同敌人。中国人民一直把拉丁美洲各国人民的斗争看成是自己的斗争，把他们的胜利看成自己的胜利，并认为拉丁美洲各国人民的每个成就都是对我们的有力支持和鼓舞。中国人民将永远支持拉丁美洲各国人民的正义斗争，并把它看做是自己的义不容辞的国际责任。
    今天的国际形势是东风继续压倒西风，社会主义力量、民族革命力量、和平民主力量空前强大和紧密团结。而帝国主义却矛盾重重，分崩离析，一天天在烂下去。出现在我们眼前的是一片大好形势。这对拉丁美洲各国人民维护和争取民族独立、为民主自由的正义斗争极为有利。拉丁美洲各国人民已经从美帝国主义及其走狗的不断失败中，日益看透美帝国主义和一切反动派都不过是外强中干的“纸老虎”。同时，拉丁美洲各国人民也将从古巴革命的胜利和不断发展中，找到摆脱美帝国主义奴役和控制和实现彻底的民族解放的正确道路。当然，今后的斗争还会是曲折、复杂和艰巨的，美帝国主义还会施展新的阴谋诡计，正如毛泽东主席所指出的，“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的”。只要拉丁美洲各国人民加强团结，坚持斗争，美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策必将彻底失败。美帝国主义一定逃不出西班牙和葡萄牙殖民统治者在拉丁美洲各国所走的可耻的失败的道路。拉丁美洲各国人民的正义斗争必将最后胜利！新的独立自由，民主幸福的拉丁美洲一定将从斗争的烈火中诞生！
    最后让我们高呼：
    古巴人民革命胜利万岁！
    拉丁美洲人民的民族、民主革命胜利万岁！
    中国和拉丁美洲各国人民间的友好团结万岁！
    世界人民大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
