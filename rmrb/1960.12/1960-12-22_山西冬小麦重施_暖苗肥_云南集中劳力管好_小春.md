Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan -- Rural people's communes in Shanxi Province are widely mobilizing the masses to strengthen winter field management of wheat, increasing the number of first-class wheat fields, upgrading second-class wheat fields, and reducing the area of third-class wheat fields. In the Jinan Prefecture, a major wheat-producing area of the province, after strengthening management, first-class wheat fields have increased from 35% to 38%, second-class wheat fields have increased from 45% to 50%, and 500,000 mu of the original 1.4 million mu of third-class wheat fields have been upgraded.

This year, there was widespread rain and snow in Shanxi in August and October, resulting in good soil moisture after wheat sowing. People's communes in various places promptly implemented the "three guarantees and one reward" system for winter wheat, promoting the rapid development of winter management work for wheat.

In the winter management of wheat, various places first applied farm manure along the ditches based on soil fertility and seedling vigor, "covering the wheat seedlings with warm quilts." At the same time, various systems were formulated to strengthen the management of livestock pens and latrines; members' fertilizers were purchased with cash at different prices according to quality, accumulating livestock manure, human urine fertilizer, and miscellaneous fertilizer while simultaneously applying it, promoting the early greening of wheat seedlings. Since the beginning of winter, according to incomplete statistics, warm seedling fertilizer has been applied to more than 320,000 mu of wheat fields. Secondly, every effort was made to water the fields for the winter to prevent spring drought. To this end, various places focused on the supporting facilities of irrigation projects and leveling the land, changing large ridges to small ridges, rationally planning winter irrigation, adopting the method of irrigating near areas before far areas, thin areas before thick areas, clay soils before loamy soils, and shady areas before sunny areas to strengthen winter irrigation. Many places promptly carried out rolling and harrowing after winter irrigation to prevent crusting and cracking and maintain soil moisture.

For some third-class wheat that was planted later and lacked basal fertilizer, various places adopted methods such as double watering and double fertilizing to cultivate them. In addition, various places also took measures such as repairing embankments and digging trenches in wheat field management to prevent livestock from trampling on wheat seedlings; at the same time, they organized the masses to prevent and control wheat diseases and insect pests as early as possible. At present, the 90,000 mu of rust-affected areas in Jinan and Jinzhong have been universally controlled.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming -- After the end of autumn sowing, Yunnan is concentrating its labor force on carefully managing spring crops. At present, Yuxi Prefecture has already watered more than 200,000 mu of spring crops once, and 70% of rapeseed, 30% of broad beans, and 16% of wheat have been top-dressed once. In the Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture, all 600,000 mu of broad beans have been tipped in a timely manner, more than half of the wheat has been rolled, and 40,000 mu of rapeseed with insect pests have also been controlled in a timely manner.

This year, various places in Yunnan have formulated measures to increase production according to local conditions, resulting in good sowing quality. After the end of sowing, various places conducted inspections to ensure that management measures were implemented solidly. After sowing, the Longjie Management Area of the Jiang Commune in Jiangchuan County organized cadres, technicians, and experienced farmers to conduct field inspections plot by plot. They found that some broad bean fields had rotten beans due to the lack of ditching for drainage, so they conducted accounting education for the commune members. As a result, more than 1,500 mu of broad bean fields with missing seedlings were replanted within ten days, ensuring full stands.

In field management, cadres at all levels went deep into the grassroots, sought advice from experienced farmers, jointly planned production increase measures with commune members, and actively implemented the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture according to local conditions, which generally improved the level of spring crop management. Cadres of the Chuxiong County Qianjin Commune Party Committee went to each production team to jointly study the key points of spring crop management in each area with cadres and the masses, according to three different types of areas: dam areas, semi-mountainous areas, and mountainous areas. After analysis, everyone believed that the dam areas had good water conservancy conditions and were mostly basic farmland; however, rust, root rot, aphids, and other diseases were more serious in previous years. Therefore, the main content of field management should be pest prevention and disaster resistance; semi-mountainous and mountainous areas were prone to drought, and it was decided to focus on drought prevention and resistance. The Juntun Management Area of the Xiabaimiao Commune in Chuxiong County studied different measures for field management according to the different growth conditions of rapeseed: for flowering rapeseed, focus on watering and top-dressing to promote plump grains; for luxuriant rapeseed, take measures of tipping, watering, and top-dressing to promote branching; for newly emerged rapeseed seedlings, seize the time to thin seedlings, replant seedlings, apply chemical fertilizers, and apply insecticide powder to promote strong and vigorous seedlings. As a result, first-class seedlings increased rapidly, and third-class seedlings were quickly reduced by half.

### 山西冬小麦重施“暖苗肥”  云南集中劳力管好“小春”

    山西冬小麦重施“暖苗肥”
    云南集中劳力管好“小春”
    新华社太原讯　山西省各地农村人民公社，广泛发动群众加强小麦越冬田间管理，使一类麦田增加，二类麦田升级，三类麦田面积在缩小。全省小麦主要产区晋南专区，经过加强管理后，一类麦田已由35％上升到38％，二类麦由45％增加到50％，原来的一百四十万亩三类麦田，有五十万亩升了级。
    今年，山西各地8、10两月普降雨雪，小麦播种后墒情较好。各地人民公社及早落实了冬小麦“三包一奖”工作，促使小麦越冬管理工作迅速开展。
    各地在小麦越冬管理中，首先根据地力和苗势顺沟追施农家肥，给麦苗“盖暖被”。同时制定了各种制度，加强对畜圈、茅厕的管理；分等论价现款收买社员肥料，大积畜肥、人尿肥和杂肥，边积边追，促麦苗早返青。入冬以来，据不完全统计，各地已在三十二万多亩麦田施了暖苗肥。其次是千方百计浇越冬水，防止春旱。为此，各地大抓灌溉工程配套和平整田地，变大畦为小畦，合理作了冬浇规划，采用先近地后远地，先薄地后厚地，先粘土地后绵土地，先背阴地后向阳地的办法，加强冬灌，许多地方在冬浇后又及时进行碾压耙耘，防止板结、裂缝，保持墒情。
    对于一些种得较迟、基肥不足的三类麦，各地在管理上都采用浇双水、追双肥等方法加工培育。另外，各地在麦田管理中，还采取修埝挖壕等办法，防止牲畜踩踏麦苗；同时组织群众及早防治小麦病虫害。现在，晋南、晋中等地区发生锈病的九万亩已经普遍进行防治。
    新华社昆明讯　云南各地结束秋种之后，正集中劳力对小春作物进行细致加工。目前，玉溪专区已经给二十多万亩小春润了一次水，70％的油菜、30％的蚕豆、16％的小麦已追肥一次。楚雄彝族自治州六十万亩蚕豆已全部及时打尖，一半以上的小麦已进行镇压，发生虫害的四万亩油菜也及时得到防治。
    云南各地今年由于因地制宜地制订了增产措施，播种质量较好。播种结束后各地又进行了检查，使管理措施踏踏实实。?江县?江公社龙街管理区播种后，组织干部、技术员、老农深入田间逐丘检查，发现有的蚕豆田因没有开沟排涝而有烂豆现象，就对社员进行算账教育。结果，十天内补种好缺塘的蚕豆田一千五百多亩，做到了全苗。
    在田间管理中，各级干部都深入基层，通过聘老农当顾问，与社员共谋增产措施，因地制宜地积极贯彻农业“八字宪法”，使小春管理水平普遍提高。楚雄县前进公社党委的干部分别深入各生产队，根据坝区、半山区、山区等三类不同地区，与干部、群众共同研究各个地区的小春管理关键。经过分析后，大家认为：坝区水利条件好，大部是基本农田；但历年来锈病、根腐病、蚜虫等较严重，因此，田间管理应以防虫抗灾为主要内容；半山区和山区易旱，决定以防旱抗旱为主。楚雄县下白庙公社军屯管理区根据油菜生长的不同情况，研究出田间管理的不同措施：对开花的油菜，抓润水追肥，促使籽粒饱满；对发蓬油菜，采取打尖、润水、追肥，促使发杈；对新出苗油菜，抓紧间苗、补苗、施化肥、打防虫粉，促使苗肥苗壮。结果，一类苗迅速增加，三类苗很快减少了一半。
