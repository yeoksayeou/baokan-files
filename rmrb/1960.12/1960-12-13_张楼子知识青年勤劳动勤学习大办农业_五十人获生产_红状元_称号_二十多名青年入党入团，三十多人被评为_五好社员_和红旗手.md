    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 12th. Fifty educated young men and women of the Zhang Louzi Production Team in the Dadianzi Commune, Tieling County, Liaoning Province, have been working diligently in agriculture and actively building a new socialist countryside for several years. They have made certain achievements in agricultural production and have been praised by the local people. The commune members call them the "Red Top Scholars" of the production team.
    These fifty "Red Top Scholars" are all members of the Zhang Louzi Production Team's Youth Shock Brigade. Among them, four young women are junior high school graduates, and the others are graduates of senior primary school and junior primary school. Twenty-two are young women. Their family backgrounds are all poor peasants, hired peasants, and middle peasants. Since 1954, after responding to the Party's call to return to their hometowns to participate in production, they have consistently been unafraid of hardship and difficulty under the leadership of the Party, working diligently and practically, and studying hard, becoming a shock force in production.
    This spring, the Youth Shock Brigade, composed of these educated youths, proposed a plan to the Party to vigorously develop high-yield rice fields. The commune members discussed it. Most commune members thought they were remarkable, wanting to implement a high-yield plan after only a few days of work. Some commune members also thought that there were many difficulties in developing high-yield rice fields, saying that they were talking nonsense and would not succeed. However, the Youth Shock Brigade was determined, and they were determined to overcome all difficulties. Not understanding the technology of seedling cultivation, they asked experienced farmers for advice. To help them learn the technology, the Party branch invited experienced farmers to give them agricultural technology lessons. After a few days of learning, most of the members learned the seedling cultivation technology. During the seedling raising period, they carefully harrowed the land and raised seedlings, and the seedlings grew very well. The commune members praised them after seeing them, saying, "These rice seedlings are blooming thanks to this group of young people!"
    During the rice transplanting season, the Youth Shock Brigade contracted to transplant seventy-three mu and one fen of rice. At that time, the season was very tight, and the team members, in order to transplant the rice on schedule, guaranteed to the Party that they would complete the task within the stipulated time.
    At that time, the weather was very cold, and there was a thin layer of ice in the paddy fields in the morning. The shock team members went to the fields every day before dawn, rolling up their sleeves, feeling for rice roots and preparing seedbeds in the paddy fields. No one dropped out. No matter how long the ridge, they bent down and worked to the end. Because they were energetic, they greatly accelerated the transplanting progress, with each person transplanting 1.2 mu of land every day. In the past, it took ten first-class laborers to transplant one hectare, but this year only eight were needed. The Youth Shock Brigade fought for twenty days and completed the task of transplanting more than seventy hectares of land on schedule, which was praised by the Party branch, and most of the shock team members were rewarded.
    Natural disasters also tested these educated youths. During the flood season this year, one-third of the land area of ​​this production team was affected by floods. The Youth Shock Brigade stood up in the face of the disaster, and many moving stories emerged. One day, the flood washed 15,000 jin of potatoes belonging to the production team into a mess. The young people jumped into the waist-deep water, some to salvage, some to transport, and in just two hours, they collected all 15,000 jin of potatoes. The next day, the river water gradually decreased, and the land on both sides of the flood river was scoured by the flood, and pieces of land sank. The commune members saw a large plot of scallions on the south bank of the river about to be washed away by the water and were very anxious. At this critical juncture, eight young men from the Youth Shock Brigade, Zhang Baoku, Xu Guangzhi, Xu Guangtian, Zhang Jingmin, Yu Zhenru, Hou Zhenzhou, Yu Chengsheng, and Wang Jinyi, braved the danger and swam to the other side from more than three meters of water. After two hours of fighting, they finally recovered 3,000 jin of scallions. A few days later, the flood flooded three mu of garlic fields. Five young women, Yang Cuilan, Yang Cuiyu, Xu Guanghua, Su Guiqing, and Yu Shuxian, once again rushed to harvest more than 4,000 jin of garlic in more than one chi deep water, reducing losses to the production team in the face of serious natural disasters.
    Under the Party's close care, education, and cultivation, and after several years of labor and production, these fifty youths have all grown up in the countryside. In recent years, eight young people have honorably joined the Party, seventeen have joined the Communist Youth League, one has been named an outstanding League member, thirty-two have been named five-good commune members, three have been selected as county-level young socialist construction activists, and four have been selected as county-level May Fourth Red Banner Bearers. Now, these "Red Top Scholars" are taking advantage of the slack winter season to recharge their batteries and prepare for a major effort next spring, while studying the Party's policies on people's communes, studying cultural technology, and further improving their political and cultural levels.

### 张楼子知识青年勤劳动勤学习大办农业  五十人获生产“红状元”称号  二十多名青年入党入团，三十多人被评为“五好社员”和红旗手

    张楼子知识青年勤劳动勤学习大办农业
    五十人获生产“红状元”称号
    二十多名青年入党入团，三十多人被评为“五好社员”和红旗手
    新华社沈阳12日电　辽宁省铁岭县大甸子公社张楼子生产队的五十名男女知识青年，几年来安心务农，积极建设社会主义农村，在农业生产上做出一定成绩，受到了当地群众的表扬。社员们称他们是生产队的“红状元”。
    这五十名“红状元”，都是张楼子生产队的青年突击队队员，其中女青年有四名是初中毕业生，其他都是高小和初小毕业生。有二十二人是女青年。他们的家庭出身都是贫、雇农和中农。1954年他们响应党的号召回乡参加生产后，几年来，在党的领导下，一贯不怕艰苦困难，遇事实干苦干，努力学习，成了生产上的一支突击力量。
    今年春天，这些知识青年组成的青年突击队向党提出了大搞水稻丰产田的计划。社员们议论纷纷。多数社员认为他们了不起，干活不几天就要搞丰产计划。也有些社员认为搞水稻丰产田困难很多，说他们是胡扯，搞不成功。但是，青年突击队意志坚决，他们决心克服一切困难。不懂育苗的技术，他们就向老农请教，党支部为了帮助他们学技术，请老农给他们上农业技术课。经过几天的学习，大部分队员都学会了育苗技术。在育秧期间，他们细心耙地、育苗，结果苗出得很好。社员看了赞扬地说：“这稻苗叫群小青年给育出‘花花’来啦！”
    在插秧的季节里，青年突击队包干了七十垧三亩一分的水稻插秧任务。当时季节很紧，队员们为了按期插好秧，向党保证要在规定的时间里完成任务。
    当时，天气很冷，早晨，水田里一层薄薄的冰。突击队员们每天天不亮就下地，卷着袖子，在水田里摸稻根、整苗床，没有一个掉队的。不论多长垅，弯下腰就干到头。由于他们干劲足，大大加快了插秧进度，每天每人插一亩二分地。过去插一垧要十个一等劳动力，今年只用八个就够了。青年突击队员奋战二十天，按期完成了七十多垧地的插秧任务，受到党支部的表扬，多数突击队员受到奖励。
    自然灾害也考验着这些知识青年。在今年洪水泛滥的日子里，这个生产队有三分之一的土地面积受到洪水侵袭。青年突击队员们在灾害面前挺身而出，出现了许多可歌可颂的人物。有一天，洪水把生产队的一万五千斤土豆冲得乱七八糟，青年们跳进齐腰深的水中，捞的捞，运的运，仅两小时就将一万五千斤土豆全部收拾起来。第二天，河水渐渐下降，汛河两岸的土地，被洪水冲击得一块块地陷下去。社员们看到河南岸的一块大葱地，即将被水冲跑，非常着急。在这紧要关头，青年突击队员张宝库、许广芝、许广田、张景民、于振如、侯振洲、于成生、王金义等八个男青年，不顾危险，从三米多深的水里游到对岸，经两个小时搏斗，终于夺回大葱三千斤。几天后，洪水又淹没了三亩地大蒜，杨翠兰、杨翠玉、许广华、苏桂清、于淑贤等五名女青年又在一尺多深的水里突击起出大蒜四千多斤，使生产队在严重的自然灾害中减少了损失。
    在党的亲切关怀和教育培养下，经过几年劳动生产的锻炼，这五十名青年都在农村成长起来了。几年来，有八名青年光荣地入了党，有十七名加入了共青团，有一名被评为优秀团员，有三十二名被评为五好社员，有三名被选为县青年社会主义建设积极分子，有四名被选为县“五四”红旗手。现在，这些“红状元”们正在利用冬季农闲季节，一面蓄精养锐，准备明春大干；一面学习党关于人民公社的政策，学习文化技术，进一步提高政治文化水平。
