Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 27th. According to a broadcast tonight by the Pathet Lao Fighting Units radio station, the communiqué issued on December 26th in Sam Neua by Gu Ning Pensena, representative of the Royal Lao Government, and Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, announced that "both sides request the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference to immediately convene a meeting of the nations participating in the 1954 Geneva Conference, and to take urgent and effective measures to ensure that the Geneva Agreement is respected and thoroughly implemented."

In the communiqué, both sides reiterated that "the legitimate government of the Kingdom of Laos and the Lao Patriotic Front will cooperate closely in the common struggle to achieve peaceful neutrality and genuine national harmony"; and declared that "the armed forces of the Royal Lao Army and the Pathet Lao Fighting Units will strengthen unity, fight together against aggressors and traitors, and build a peaceful, neutral, harmonious, unified, and independent Laos."

The communiqué said that Gu Ning Pensena, representative of the legitimate government of the Kingdom of Laos, visited Sam Neua on December 22, 1960, and held cordial talks with Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front. The communiqué said that both sides jointly believed that the situation in Laos had recently become extremely serious.

The communiqué reviewed the activities of the Vong Na Champassak-Phoumi Nosavan rebel clique, supported by the United States and Thailand, in attacking and occupying the capital Vientiane and establishing an illegal puppet "provisional government," and pointed out that the above-mentioned conspiracies and criminal activities were met with extreme resentment and resolute opposition from the entire Lao people. The communiqué said, "Both sides believe that the heroic battles of the military and civilians of Vientiane and the military and civilians of Laos in defending the capital are a great victory, and both sides warmly welcome and praise the indomitable fighting spirit shown by our people and army." The communiqué also said, "Both sides express heartfelt gratitude for the sympathy and support of the peace-loving people of the world, the invaluable assistance of the Soviet government and people, and the support of the governments and people of Asian and African countries and other peace-loving countries for the Kingdom of Laos in its difficult situation."

The communiqué pointed out that the temporary withdrawal of the government and army from Vientiane was necessary to preserve strength for the long-term struggle to liberate the motherland. The communiqué said, "Both sides firmly believe that under the conditions of national unity, long-term hard struggle, and never surrendering to the enemy, with the sympathy and support of the governments and people of peace-loving countries around the world, the just struggle of our people will surely achieve final victory."

The communiqué said, "In the face of the current situation in the motherland, both sides emphasize that the content of the joint communiqué issued by Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma and Lao Patriotic Front Chairman Prince Souphanouvong on November 20, 1960, is completely correct and must continue to be implemented."

In the joint communiqué, Prime Minister Phouma and Prince Souphanouvong declared that Laos must resolutely pursue a path of peaceful neutrality, accept sincere assistance from all countries without any binding conditions, establish diplomatic relations with these countries, and that it is necessary to establish a coalition government that includes representatives of all nationalities and patriotic parties, including the Lao Patriotic Front.

The communiqué also said, "Both sides solemnly declare again that the Lao people only recognize the only legitimate government headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma, which has been trusted by the National Assembly and approved by the King. This government has announced and initially implemented a policy of genuine peaceful neutrality and national harmony. This government is in accordance with the wishes of the people throughout the country and is in accordance with the spirit of the Geneva Agreement and the Vientiane Agreement." The two sides, representing the legitimate government of the Kingdom of Laos and the Lao Patriotic Front, called on all strata of the Lao people, all ethnic groups, all religious believers, all political parties, patriots, monks, soldiers, police, civil servants, youth, students, etc., to unite closely around the legitimate government and resolutely struggle to achieve peaceful neutrality, national harmony, and the independence and unity of the motherland. Both sides also called on the people and governments of all peace-loving countries in the world to support the struggle of the Lao government and people to achieve peaceful neutrality, national harmony, and to defend the independence and unity of the motherland, and to maintain peace in Asia.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 28th. The Pathet Lao Fighting Units radio station today broadcast the statement issued by the Committee for Peaceful Neutrality, National Harmony, and Unified Nation, broadcast by the "Voice of Laos" radio station, condemning the United States, Thailand, and the South Vietnamese authorities for blatant interference and aggression against Laos.

The statement said that the Lao people expressed great indignation at the actions of U.S. imperialism and its servants Thailand and South Vietnam in invading Laos, destroying the peace of Laos and the Geneva Agreement, and being determinedly hostile to the Lao people. The Lao people will never forgive their crimes.

The statement announced:
