Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 12th: The Shanghai Early Childhood Health Education Committee, in conjunction with relevant departments, is adopting various methods to train childcare workers and improve the quality of childcare work in kindergartens and nurseries.

Since this spring, Shanghai's early childhood childcare services have developed greatly with the establishment of urban residents' organizations and the growth of rural people's communes. At present, nearly one million children in the city are in childcare, most of them in newly established nurseries and kindergartens in districts, streets, and rural people's communes. Among the childcare workers in these nurseries (kindergartens), about half are housewives who have joined the workforce recently. Most of them are highly motivated and wholeheartedly want to do a good job in childcare, but they lack experience in collectively raising children. In response to these situations, the Shanghai Municipal, District, and Street Committees, as well as the suburban counties and communes, have generally organized forces to train childcare workers using various methods.

Under the leadership of the street committees, each street and lane generally established early childhood health education groups, organizing street cultural and educational cadres, women's cadres, doctors from local hospitals, primary school teachers, and educators from public kindergartens to help newly employed childcare workers with one or two weeks of study. This aims to enable them to understand the significance of childcare work and learn some health knowledge and educational methods. For some childcare workers who have already started working, the approach is to organize them to participate in various spare-time classes and short-term off-the-job training to help them learn and improve skills such as pinyin, music, painting, and injections. Many streets and rural people's communes also adopt methods such as public kindergartens (nurseries) leading private kindergartens (nurseries), and experienced childcare workers leading new childcare workers, to regularly help newly established kindergartens (nurseries) improve their work.

Entrusted by the Municipal Early Childhood Health Education Committee, the Shanghai Municipal Preschool Normal School, Normal School, and Health School have also held short-term training courses, absorbing childcare workers with certain work experience to systematically improve their professional knowledge and health care knowledge.

    进行思想教育　传授业务知识
    上海加速培训保育人员
    新华社上海12日电　上海幼儿保健教育委员会会同有关部门，采取多种多样办法，培训保育人员，提高幼儿园、托儿所的保育工作水平。
    今春以来，上海的幼儿保育事业随着城市居民组织的建立和农村人民公社的发展壮大，有很大的发展。现在全市共有近一百万孩子入托，其中大部分在地区、街道和农村人民公社新办的托儿所幼儿园。这些托儿所（园）的保育人员中，大约半数是今年参加工作不久的家庭妇女，大部分人干劲很足，一心一意想做好保育工作，但对集体教养孩子的经验还比较缺乏。针对这些情况，上海市、区和街道委员会，以及郊区的县、公社普遍组织力量，用各种办法培训保育人员。
    在街道委员会领导下，各街道和里弄一般都成立了幼儿保健教育小组，组织街道文教干部、妇女干部、地段医院的医生、小学教师，以及公立幼儿园的教养员帮助新参加工作的保育人员进行一、两个星期的学习，使她们懂得保育工作的意义，并学会一些保健知识和教养方法。对于一些已经参加工作的保育人员，则采取组织她们参加各种业余学习班和短期离职学习的办法，帮助她们分别学习和提高汉语拼音、音乐、绘画、注射等技能。很多街道和农村人民公社还采取以公立幼儿园（所）带民办幼儿园（所），老的保育人员带新的保育人员等方式经常帮助新成立的幼儿园（所）改进工作。
    上海市立幼儿师范学校、师范学校、卫生学校在市幼儿保健教育委员会的委托下，也都举办了短期训练班，吸收有一定工作经验的保育人员参加，系统地提高她们的业务知识和卫生保健知识。
