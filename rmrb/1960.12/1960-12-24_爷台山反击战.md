The Battle of Counterattack on Yetai Mountain
Major General Cheng Yuechang

I.

In July 1945, the wheat had already been harvested, and millet, rice, and paddy were flowering and bearing grain. On the slopes, green waves rippled, foretelling another year of abundance. Our 16th Regiment of the New Fourth Brigade was stationed in Ganquan and Fu County in the Yan'an sub-region of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, and the commanders and fighters were overjoyed to see the crops they had planted with their own hands, covering the mountains and plains, about to be harvested.

One day at noon, the soldiers who had been weeding in the fields had finished their lunch, and each had chosen a shady spot to rest. The battalion and regimental cadres returned from the fields to the regimental headquarters during their lunch break to discuss the autumn harvest. I was the commander of the 16th Regiment of the New Fourth Brigade at the time. As we were talking animatedly, the cipher clerk suddenly entered the cave and handed me a top-secret telegram from the Joint Defense Headquarters of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, forwarded by the Military Commission. As I looked at the text, I felt the blood vessels in my body expand rapidly. It turned out that at dawn on July 21, the Kuomintang Provisional 59th Division and the 2nd Cavalry Division suddenly attacked our Yetai Mountain position in Chunhua County, Guanzhong sub-region. Six companies of our 771st Regiment stationed in Guanzhong carried out heroic self-defense. The battle continued until the 23rd, and the position remained standing. The enemy then committed the Provisional 3rd Division to the battle. By the evening of the 27th, we had inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy, but due to the disparity in strength, we withdrew from Yetai Mountain. The Military Commission ordered us to immediately reinforce Guanzhong, with specific tasks to be received in Malan... I tried my best to suppress the anger in my heart and told my comrades the news. The comrades couldn't suppress their anger and cursed Chiang Kai-shek:

"Chiang Kai-shek is really despicable! We've been fighting the Japanese devils for eight years, but he's been creating friction and engaging in anti-communism all along. Now that the victory against Japan is a foregone conclusion, he's taking the opportunity to launch an attack on the Border Region. It's outrageous!"

Political Commissar Chang Xiangkao said to me, "Old Cheng, do you think we should have the battalion cadres go back immediately and bring the troops to Xiaoshanzi to assemble? When can we get there?"

To be honest, I was worried about the time: the troops stationed in Kangzhuang and Fucun River were fifty or sixty li away from the regimental headquarters, and the nearby troops were also twenty or thirty li away. The soldiers were all in the fields at this time, with people all over the mountains and caves. Assembling the troops, communicating the mission, returning to the garrison to retrieve weapons and supplies, and arranging for the personnel left behind all required time. I looked at my watch and said, "It's not yet four o'clock. You go back immediately to assemble the troops. Also, tell the communications platoon to send several cavalry messengers to notify the troops further away. In any case, they must arrive at Xiaoshanzi before eight o'clock."

The whole regiment was rapidly assembling, with bugle calls resounding incessantly in the distance and whistles blowing nearby. The warhorses were re-equipped with saddles and bridles, standing tall beside their masters, shaking their manes and occasionally raising their heads to neigh before setting off...

The troops gathered from all directions on an open space on the hillside opposite Xiaoshanzi Village. Some soldiers were bareheaded, and others were only wearing a pair of shorts. It was clear that they had dropped their hoes and grabbed their weapons and ammunition pouches and ran. From their tightly clenched lips and stern expressions, it could be seen that flames of anger were burning in the hearts of the soldiers.

It was almost nine o'clock, time to depart. I only said a few simple words to the soldiers: "The Kuomintang reactionaries won't let us fight the Japanese devils, nor will they let us carry out peaceful production. Now they have extended their bloody hands into the gate of the Border Region. Defending the Border Region, defending the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, is the most glorious task. Everyone hasn't eaten dinner and has already walked sixty or seventy li. We still have to march all night tonight. It's a three-day journey from here to Malan. We must get there in two days. The mission is urgent. I won't say much more, let's go."

The darkness swallowed the villages and fields, stars twinkled in the sky, and the long marching column set off, advancing rapidly towards Malan in the Guanzhong sub-region...

II.

The troops marched day and night, arriving in Malan in just one and a half days.

The day after arriving in Malan, Commander Zhang Zongxun and Political Commissar Xi Zhongxun of our group army and our brigade leaders held a cadre meeting to analyze the current situation and tasks for us. They pointed out that in recent years, the diehards around the Border Region had often used the excuse of "fighting in the field" and "catching deserters" to wantonly create friction and had often raped and plundered in our Guanzhong sub-region, doing everything possible. We had endured these incidents again and again in order to unite in resisting Japan. The reactionaries' wolfish ambitions had not changed, and this time they had mobilized a large army to invade and occupy our Yetai Mountain position and the surrounding forty-one villages. Their purpose was to seize our Guanzhong sub-region and contain our army in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia from launching a full-scale counter-offensive against the Japanese invaders, in order to provoke a criminal civil war.

The situation was already very clear. If we did not give a resolute rebuff, not only would the anger of the masses in the Guanzhong sub-region not be quelled, but the Kuomintang would inevitably become more aggressive, and the crisis of civil war would be intensified. Chairman Mao taught us that our policy towards the enemy is: "We will not attack unless we are attacked; if we are attacked, we will certainly counter-attack."

At the meeting, after analyzing the situation of the enemy and ourselves, the leaders particularly emphasized that in order to achieve political and military victory in this struggle against the stubborn elements, we must continue to strictly implement Chairman Mao's policy of "reason, advantage, and restraint." After the counterattack begins, we must not let a single enemy escape within our territory, but we must never cross the border even one step.

Our army decided to choose Yetai Mountain as the main direction of the battle's assault. The troop deployment was as follows: five battalions of the New Fourth Brigade, equipped with the 3rd Regiment of the 1st Police Brigade, with one battalion attached to a mountain gun, would be the main attack force; the 771st Regiment on the left, the 1st Battalion of the 3rd Police Regiment on the right, and our 16th Regiment in the center. The 358th Brigade was the auxiliary force, gathered in the mobile positions of Phoenix Mountain and Zhaojin, ready to strike at the counter-attacking enemy. The 1st and 2nd Education Brigades were gathered in the Lingwan and Shangzhenzi areas as the battle reserve, closely monitoring the enemy on the east and west sides to ensure the safety of our army's rear.

On the afternoon of the day the combat plan was formulated, the brigade leaders gathered cadres above the level of squad leader and Party group leader to talk about the tactical aspects of attacking Yetai Mountain. He waved his fist at everyone and said, "To fight the Kuomintang enemy, you have to be fierce, ruthless, and accurate! When attacking, you can't be like pouring boiling water from a teapot, taking forever to pour out so little. You have to be like lifting a full bucket of water and pouring it into a hot pot – as soon as the hand grenade goes off, your bayonet has to stab into his belly..." When the leader spoke to this point, the comrades below immediately became active, their eyes radiating an unusual brilliance, and they proudly puffed out their chests, as if at the sound of an order, even if Yetai Mountain was a tiger's den or a dragon's pool, the comrades would rush in without hesitation.

Various preparations before the battle were carried out meticulously and intensively: commanders repeatedly checked the terrain, and night combat exercises were also carried out intensely...

The broad masses of the Guanzhong sub-region actively participated in this struggle to defend the Border Region and counterattack the stubborn elements. Regardless of their personal safety, they volunteered to act as guides for the combat troops, boiled water and cooked meals for the troops, organized stretchers to rescue the wounded, and also organized many guerrilla groups and demolition teams to move around, cooperating with the troops to defend the border and constantly attacking the Kuomintang army. All of this greatly encouraged the commanders and fighters' confidence in victory.

III.

At twelve o'clock on the night of August 8, our army launched an attack on the enemy guarding Yetai Mountain.

The night was pitch-black, making it impossible to distinguish mountains and rivers, or distance. It was drizzling. The soldiers wrapped their guns in blankets, but let the rain soak them. The mountain gullies were muddy and difficult to walk, and the soldiers kept stumbling, but the morale of the troops was very high. Everyone knew that such a rainy night was a great opportunity to surprise the enemy.

A little after eleven o'clock, the 1st Company sneaked into the enemy's outpost on Yetai Mountain – Hujiazui. The enemy sentries were unprepared, and two soldiers from our vanguard squad pounced on them, and their bayonets flashed before their eyes and disarmed them. The troops smoothly infiltrated the position. They saw a light on in a shed, and several Kuomintang officers were playing mahjong. At twelve o'clock, three red signal flares went up, and the attack began. With a loud explosion of a hand grenade, dozens of bayonets approached the enemy's chest from different directions. Without firing a shot, this outpost and its defending platoon were eliminated.

According to the pre-arranged division of labor: the 2nd Battalion, except for the 5th Company which was responsible for capturing several fortifications on the west side of the main Yetai Mountain position, with the main force of the entire battalion acting as the regiment's mobile force to reinforce the 1st Battalion at any time; the 3rd Battalion was to set up an ambush between Baozigou and Erwangzhuang, ready to cut off the retreat of the Yetai Mountain defenders when they fled south towards Fanglizhen; the task of attacking the main Yetai Mountain position was entrusted to the 1st Battalion. At this moment, Ren Yingkui, the battalion commander of the 1st Battalion, had already led the 2nd and 3rd Companies around the outpost, climbed up the Yaoxian from the gully, and went straight to the main Yetai Mountain position. Before the enemy noticed, the soldiers of the 2nd Company quickly and vigilantly occupied the independent house more than 100 meters away from the main bunker, ready to launch an attack from here.

Defending Yetai Mountain was the 3rd Battalion, 3rd Regiment of the Provisional 59th Division, under Hu Zongnan, with three infantry companies, one heavy machine gun company, and an attached reinforced company – the 4th Company of the 2nd Battalion. This 4th Company was a famous "victorious army" in the Kuomintang army for firmly defending positions. It had recently returned from suppressing "popular revolts" in the Lintao and Minxian areas. Because of their meritorious service in massacring the people, the division headquarters gave each of them a bonus of 40,000 yuan in bogus currency. This time they voluntarily requested to defend the main Yetai Mountain bunker, and the regimental headquarters awarded them another 10,000 yuan each. On the back of the badges of the officers and soldiers of this company were printed the words "Party Guard," intending to imitate Hitler's "SS" and be loyal to Chiang Kai-shek's fascist rule. The opponent encountered by the 1st Battalion was an extremely stubborn enemy.

The rain stopped, the east gradually brightened, and the brother units on the surrounding mountains launched a fierce attack on the defending enemy, with gunfire cracking like popping beans. At this time, a group of the enemy's "Party Guard" 4th Company defending the main bunker suddenly rushed out, wanting to recapture the independent house, trying to push us into the gully to reduce the threat to the front of the main bunker. The soldiers of the 2nd Company knew that this independent house was the foothold for our army to completely annihilate the Yetai Mountain defenders. If they could not hold it, it would affect the overall situation of the battle. Under the command of Company Commander Liu Guangrong, they sometimes fought the enemy inside the house and sometimes rushed out of the house to fight the enemy. The machine guns in the enemy's main bunker kept firing, and the casualties of the 2nd Company were increasing. Company Commander Liu Guangrong heroically sacrificed himself. Platoon Leader Fan Wensheng continued to lead the soldiers to firmly defend the independent house. Due to the enemy's firepower blockade, ammunition could not be replenished from the rear, so the soldiers picked up hand grenades and bullets from the bodies of the sacrificed comrades and the enemy's corpses to continue to attack the enemy. At 9:00 am, they finally held the independent house and completely annihilated an enemy platoon.

At the same time, the 3rd Battalion, which was ambushing on the southern line, was conducting an interesting struggle with the enemy. They cut the telephone line between the Yetai Mountain defenders and the enemy division headquarters stationed in Fanglizhen and connected the line to our machine. Yang Xingguo, the battalion commander of the 3rd Battalion, dialed the telephone of the enemy's command post on Yetai Mountain. He heard a yell in the earpiece: "Are you the division headquarters? I am on the mountain. The Communist attack is fierce. Those people are simply not afraid of death. If you don't send reinforcements, the position will be lost..." Comrade Yang Xingguo deliberately said: "Brother, be calm, be calm. I am the chief of the operations section of the division headquarters. I am arranging reinforcements for you now. They will arrive tomorrow. The division commander orders you to hold on until tomorrow..." With a "click," the other party hung up the earpiece and left. Comrade Yang Xingguo then called the enemy division headquarters: "Division headquarters? I am on the mountain. There is no problem with the position. Yes, the Communist casualties are very heavy. Reward? No need, no need."

This arrangement bought time for the main attack force.

The enemy positions on the east and west wings were quickly captured by us. However, the battle on the main position of Yetai Mountain was still going on fiercely. The casualties of the 1st Battalion were increasing. We notified the 1st Battalion that we planned to reinforce them with the 4th Company of the 2nd Battalion. The messenger returned and said: "The comrades of the 1st Battalion are fighting very tenaciously. They are determined to avenge the sacrificed comrades and will not leave the front line until the enemy is eliminated. Battalion Commander Ren asked me to tell the leader that this time we are fighting at our doorstep, and we will take the Yetai Mountain position even if we die."

At about 10:00 am, our mountain guns also began to bombard Yetai Mountain. Smoke filled the commanding heights of Yetai Mountain, and dense machine gun bullets also flew towards the enemy's position. The 6th Company of the 2nd Battalion of the 8th Regiment of the brother unit 358th Brigade, led by the deputy battalion commander, also joined the battle. At this time, Brigade Commander Wang issued the order for a general attack to us.

At this time, Comrade Ren Yingkui reorganized the entire battalion's strength and fire, and led the soldiers to continuously charge towards the main position. The main position was located high up, and the fortifications were built on cliffs, defended on three levels by the enemy "Party Guard" 4th Company and a heavy machine gun company, and it was also the enemy's battalion command post. However, the strong spirit of revenge and unwavering determination to win encouraged the soldiers to rush up fearlessly. Reaching the bottom of the cliff, they built human ladders to climb up, fighting the enemy with hand grenades and bayonets along the layers of fortifications. The battlefield was filled with black smoke, bayonets were waving, and the soldiers fought more and more bravely. Chiang Kai-shek's "Party Guard" company was no match at all. In this close-quarters combat, our soldiers captured the position layer by layer, and by 11:00 am, all the defenders on Yetai Mountain were annihilated. In addition to recovering Yetai Mountain and all forty-one lost villages nearby, we completely annihilated five entire enemy companies and a battalion headquarters.

The red flag of victory was planted on the recovered land of the Border Region.

IV.

Three days after the end of the Yetai Mountain battle, an American military "mediation group" came from Xi'an to conduct a so-called "on-site investigation." Their purpose was nothing more than to find "evidence" to accuse our army and exonerate the Kuomintang from the responsibility for the civil war. Political Commissar Xi Zhongxun ordered me to accompany them to the position to see for themselves. We came to Yetai Mountain, where evidence was indeed everywhere. I pointed to the boxes containing American bullets and shells and picked up fragments of榴弹炮shells with the letters U.S.A. and gave them the American-made shell casings, saying: "Please see, these are all weapons that your country aided the Kuomintang army with. The Kuomintang relies on the military supplies you aided to attack our Border Region and launch the civil war." The Americans were speechless and looked embarrassed. Then they pretended to be calm and searched inside and outside the trenches again, but of course they did not find any "evidence" that suited them, so they had to return in a sorry state.

Six days after the victory in the Yetai Mountain counterattack—on August 15th, the Japanese devils surrendered unconditionally. That afternoon, we held a memorial service for the sacrificed martyrs on Yetai Mountain, followed by a military-civilian get-together. Everyone was teary-eyed and speechless with joy. The local people brought a large number of慰劳品品to the troops. At this time, the old branch secretary of Kangzhuang where my regiment was originally stationed—we all called him Old Secretary Yuan—also drove dozens of donkeys from two hundred li away and brought all the weapons and clothing that our troops did not have time to collect and take away when they set off, saying that the troops needed them to fight the stubborn elements, and also brought a lot of fresh pork. The enthusiasm of the masses deeply moved every comrade in the troops.

The sky was bright, the golden sunshine shone on the beautiful rivers and mountains of the motherland, shone on the excited faces of the people, and thunderous slogans roared in the venue!

"Celebrate the victory of the War of Resistance!" "Celebrate the victory of the Yetai Mountain counterattack!"

"Oppose the Kuomintang's civil war conspiracy and realize domestic peace!"...

Some soldiers composed a folk rhyme on the spot: Yetai Mountain, high and high, the stubborn army secretly fires guns to attack,妄想to挑动 the civil war. The Border Region's soldiers and civilians rise up together,缴 his guns and炮, even Chiang Kai-shek's孝子 Party Guard, cannot escape. Chiang Kai-shek, Hu Zongnan, we teach you a lesson, if you want to create friction again, we'll show you the example of Yetai Mountain, we'll show you...

    爷台山反击战
    少将　程悦长
    一
    1945年7月，麦田早已收过，糜、谷、稻子正在扬花、吐穗。山坡上下，碧波千顷，预告着又是一个丰收年。我们新四旅十六团驻扎在陕甘宁边区延安分区的甘泉、鄜县一带，眼望着自己亲手栽种的庄稼，漫山遍野，即将丰收，指战员们万分喜悦。
    一天中午，在地里锄草的战士们已经吃罢午饭，各人拣个荫凉地方休息去了。营、团干部们抽午休时间从地里回到团部研究秋收问题。我当时是新四旅十六团的团长。大家正谈得起劲，机要员突然走进窑洞，把一封电报递到我的手中。这是陕甘宁边区联防司令部转发军委的一封万万火急的电报。我望着电文，只觉得浑身血管在急剧地膨胀。原来7月21日拂晓，国民党暂编五十九师、骑兵第二师突然向我关中分区淳化县爷台山阵地袭击，我驻关中七七一团六个连进行了英勇自卫，战斗至23日，阵地屹立未动，敌即以预备第三师投入战斗，至27日晚，我因予敌以重大杀伤，且众寡悬殊，即撤出爷台山。军委命令我们即刻增援关中，具体任务到马栏领受……。我尽量按捺着心头的怒火，把这一消息告给了同志们。同志们压不住心头的怒火，大骂蒋介石：
    “蒋介石真卑鄙！咱们八年抗战，他却搞磨擦，闹反共，一直没有断过。现在眼看抗战胜利已成定局，又乘机向边区动起武来，真是岂有此理！”
    常祥考政委对我说：“老程，你看是不是让各营干部马上回去，把部队带到小山子集结，什么时候赶到呢？”
    说实话，我正为时间问题发急：驻康庄和付村川的部队，距团部五、六十里，近的部队离团部也有二、三十里，这阵战士们又都下地了，满山满窑都有人。而集合队伍，传达任务，回驻地携带武器和给养，安顿留守人员，这一切都需要时间。我看了看表，说：“现在还不到四点，你们马上回去集合队伍，另外叫通讯排多派几个骑兵通讯员，分头通知远处的部队，无论如何，八点以前要赶到小山子。”
    全团在迅速地集结着，远处的军号声，近处的哨子声响不绝耳。战马重新备上了鞍辔，挺立在主人身旁，抖动着鬃毛，不时仰起头，发出出征前的嘶叫……。
    部队从四面八方向小山子村对面山坡上一块空地上集结。战士们有的光着头，有的只穿一件裤衩。看得出来，他们是一手丢下锄头，一手捞起武器和子弹袋就跑来的。从他们那紧咬的嘴唇，那严峻的神色，可以看到一团团愤怒的烈火，正在战士们心中燃烧。
    时间快到九点，应该出发了，我只对战士们简单讲了几句话：“国民党反动派不让我们打日本鬼子，又不让我们进行和平生产，现在他们已经把血手伸进了边区的大门。保卫边区，保卫党中央和毛主席，这是最光荣的任务。大家都没吃晚饭，已经走了六、七十里，今晚还得走一通夜。从这里到马栏是三天的路程，我们一定要两天赶到，任务紧急，我不多讲了，出发。”
    黑夜吞没了村庄、田野，天空闪动点点繁星，长长的行军行列出动了，向着关中分区——马栏疾速地前进……。
    二
    部队昼夜兼程，只一天半的时间就赶到了马栏。
    到马栏的第二天，我们集团军的张宗逊司令员、习仲勋政治委员和我们的旅首长，召集了个干部会议，向我们分析了当前的形势和任务，指出这些年来，顽固派在边区周围，经常以“打野外”、“抓逃兵”等为借口，肆意制造磨擦，并且经常在我关中分区奸淫掳掠，无所不为，对于这些事件，我们为了团结抗日，一忍再忍。反动派狼子野心不变，这次又调集大军，侵占我爷台山阵地和周围的四十一个村庄，他们的目的是：夺取我关中分区，箝制陕甘宁我军向日寇的全面反攻，以挑起罪恶的内战。
    事情已经很明显，我们如果不给予坚决的回击，不仅关中分区群众的愤怒不能平息，而且国民党必然会得寸进尺，内战危机就要加剧。毛主席教导我们，对待敌人，我们的方针是：“人不犯我，我不犯人，人若犯我，我必犯人。”
    会议上，首长们在分析了敌我形势后，特别强调地指出：为了在这次反顽斗争中取得政治上和军事上的胜利，必须继续严格地执行毛主席指示的“有理、有利、有节”的政策。反击开始后，要求在我们的境内不让一个敌人跑掉，但我们也绝不越过界线一步。
    我军决定选择爷台山为战斗的主要突击方向，兵力部署是：新四旅五个营配属警一旅三团，一营附山炮一门为主攻部队；七七一团在左，警三团一营在右，我们十六团居中。三五八旅为助攻部队，集结于凤凰山、照金一带的机动位置，准备打击反攻的敌人。教导一、二旅集结于岭湾、上畛子地区，为战役预备队，严密监视东西两面的敌人，保障我军后方的安全。
    制定作战计划的那天下午，旅首长把班长和党小组长以上的干部集合起来，讲关于攻打爷台山时的战术方面的问题。他挥动拳头对大家说：“打国民党这号敌人，就是要猛、要狠、要准！攻击的时候，不能像茶壶里倒开水，老半天倒那么一点点，要像提着一满桶水猛向热锅里倒的那样架势——手榴弹一响，你的刺刀就得?到他的肚皮上……”首长讲到这里，下面的同志顿时活跃起来，眼睛里放射着异样光彩，一个个骄傲地挺起了胸脯，仿佛只要一声命令，纵使爷台山是虎穴龙潭，同志们也会毫不犹豫地冲进去。
    战前的各项准备工作在细致而紧张地进行着：指挥员们反复查看了地形，各部队夜间战斗的演习活动也紧张地开展起来……。
    关中分区的广大群众踊跃投入了这次保卫边区，反击顽固派的斗争。他们不顾个人安危，主动为作战部队作向导，为部队烧水作饭组织担架抢救伤员，而且还组织了许多游击小组和爆破组四出活动，配合部队守卫边防，不断地袭击国民党军队。这一切，大大地鼓舞了指战员们的胜利信心。
    三
    8月8日夜十二点整，我军向爷台山守敌发起攻击。
    夜，黑洞洞的，分不清山川，也分不出远近。雨簌簌地下着。战士们用被单把枪裹起来，而自己却让雨淋着。山沟泥泞难走，战士们走着尽?跤，然而部队战士情绪很高。大家心里明白，这样的雨夜，正是奇袭敌人的绝好机会。
    十一点多钟，一连摸进了爷台山敌人的前哨阵地——胡家咀。敌人哨兵毫无准备，被我尖兵班的两个战士，猛扑过去，刺刀在眼前一晃就缴了械。部队顺利插进了阵地，只见一间棚屋里亮着灯，几个国民党军官正在打麻将。十二点光景，三颗红色讯号弹升起，攻击开始了，一声手榴弹的巨响，几十把刺刀分头逼近了敌人的胸前。一枪未发，这个前哨阵地及其守军一个排就这样给搞掉了。
    按照事前分工：二营除五连负责攻占爷台山主阵地西侧的几个工事、全营主力作全团机动部队随时增援一营，三营在豹子沟至二王庄之间设伏，准备爷台山的守敌向方里镇方面南逃时截断其归路；攻击爷台山主阵地的任务我们交给了一营。此刻，一营营长任英魁带着二、三连早已绕过前哨阵地，从沟里爬上崾岘，直插到爷台山主阵地上。乘敌人没有发觉，二连战士们迅速、机警地占领了距主碉一百多米的独立屋，准备在这里发起攻击。
    守备爷台山的是胡宗南所属暂编五十九师的第三团第三营，有三个步兵连，一个重机枪连，另有配属的第二营的加强连——第四连。这个第四连，是国民党军里固守阵地有名的“常胜军”，最近才从临洮、岷县一带镇压“民变”回来，因屠杀人民有功，师部给了每人四万元伪币的奖金。这次他们自动要求守备爷台山主碉，团部又奖给他们每人一万元。这个连的官兵的徽章里侧都印有“党卫”二字，意在仿效希特勒的“党卫军”效忠于蒋介石的法西斯统治。一营碰到的对手是个极顽固的敌人。
    雨停了，东方渐渐发白，四面山头上兄弟部队向守敌发起了猛烈的攻击，枪声爆豆子似地响着。这时，守备主碉的敌党卫第四连一股，突然蜂拥冲了出来，想夺回独立屋，企图把我们压到沟里去，以减去对主碉正面的威胁。二连的战士们知道，这个独立屋是我军全歼爷台山守敌的立脚点，如果守不住，就要影响战斗的全局。他们在连长刘光荣同志的指挥下，时而在屋内与敌人作战，时而冲到屋外和敌人搏斗。敌人主碉里的机枪不停地射击着，二连的伤亡越来越大。连长刘光荣同志壮烈牺牲了。排长范文生同志继续率领战士们坚守着独立屋，由于敌人的火力封锁，后面的弹药补充上不来，战士们就从牺牲的同志身上，从敌人的死尸上捡起手榴弹和子弹继续打击敌人。上午九时，终于守住了独立屋，全歼敌人一个排。
    与此同时，设伏在南线的三营正和敌人进行着一场有趣的斗争。他们剪断了爷台山守敌和驻方里镇敌人师部之间的电话线，把线接到我们的机子上。三营营长杨兴国同志摇通了爷台山敌人指挥所的电话，只听耳机里嚷叫：“你是师部吗？我是山上，共军攻击猛烈，那些人简直不怕死，再不派援兵，阵地就要丢……。”杨兴国同志故意说：“老兄，沉着点，沉着点，我是师部作战处长，现在正给你们调援兵，明天才能赶到，师长命令你们无论如何要坚持到明天……”“咔”的一声，对方甩掉耳机走了。杨兴国同志又挂通了敌师部的电话：“师部吗？我是山上，阵地没有问题。是的，共军伤亡很大。奖励？不必了，不必了。”
    这一摆布，为主攻部队争取了时间。
    东西两翼的敌人阵地很快全部被我攻占。但是，爷台山主阵地上的战斗还在激烈地进行着，一营的伤亡越来越大，我们通知一营打算把二营四连增援上去，通信员回来说：“一营的同志们打得很顽强，他们决心为牺牲的同志报仇，不消灭敌人决不下火线。任营长叫我转告首长，这次是在家门口打仗，死也要拿下爷台山阵地。”
    上午十时许，我们的山炮也向爷台山开始轰击，硝烟迷漫了爷台山的制高点，密集的机枪子弹也向敌人阵地飞去。兄弟部队三五八旅八团二营六连由副营长率领也投入了战斗。王旅长在这个时候向我们下达了总攻的命令。
    此时，任英魁同志重新组织了全营的兵力和火器，带领战士们向主阵地连续冲击。主阵地居高临下，工事构筑在断崖峭壁上，分三层由敌党卫第四连和一个重机枪连把守着，又是敌人营指挥所。然而强烈的复仇情绪，毫不动摇的必胜信念，鼓舞着战士们奋不顾身地冲了上去，冲到崖壁下，便搭起人梯往上爬，沿着一层一层的工事，与敌人拚手榴弹和刺刀。阵地上黑烟滚滚，刺刀挥舞，战士们越打越勇，蒋介石的党卫连根本不是对手。就在这短兵相接的搏斗中，我们的战士们一层一层地攻了上去，战斗到十一时全歼了爷台山上的守敌。我除收复爷台山和附近四十一个村子全部失地外，全歼敌五个整连和一个营部。
    胜利的红旗，插上了失而复得的边区土地上。

    爷台山战事结束后的第三天，一个美军“调解组”自西安前来进行所谓“现场调查”。他们的目的，无非是寻找指责我军、为国民党开脱内战责任的“证据”。习仲勋政委命我陪同他们到阵地上去实地看看。我们来到爷台山上，这里的证据的确遍地皆是，我随手指着那些装美国子弹炮弹的箱子，并捡起有着U．S．A字样的榴弹炮弹片，美造子弹壳交给他们说：“请看，这都是贵国援助国民党军队的武器。国民党就是依靠了你们援助的军火进攻我们边区发动内战的。”那几个美国人张口结舌，窘态毕露。接着他们故作镇静地又在战壕内外搜索了一圈，结果当然什么合他们心意的“证据”也没得着，只好狼狈地回去了。
    爷台山反击战胜利后的第六天——8月15日，日本鬼子无条件投降了。这天下午，我们在爷台山上追悼了牺牲的烈士们，接着又召开了军民联欢大会。人们一个个热泪盈眶，高兴得说不出话来。当地群众给部队送来了大批的慰劳品。就在这个时候，我团原来驻扎的康庄的那位老支部书记——我们都叫他袁老支书，也赶着几十头毛驴，从二百里路外，把我们部队出发时来不及集中和带走的武器、衣物统统送来了，说部队打顽固派要用，还送来了许多新鲜猪肉。群众这种热情盛意，深深感动了部队每一个同志。
    天空是明朗朗的，金色的阳光照耀着祖国的锦绣山河，照耀着人们激动的面孔，会场上吼起了雷动的口号声！
    “庆祝抗战胜利！”“庆祝爷台山反击战胜利！”
    “反对国民党的内战阴谋，实现国内和平！”……
    有几个战士，当时就编了一段顺口溜：爷台山，高又高，顽固军背地放枪来进攻，妄想把内战挑。边区军民同奋起，缴他的枪和炮，连蒋介石的孝子党卫军，一个也跑不掉。蒋介石，胡宗南，我们教训你，再要搞磨擦，用爷台山的例子给你瞧，给你瞧……。〔中国人民解放军三十年征文稿〕
