Steel flowers dance before the furnace, workers at the Beijing Steel Plant are working happily.
The team leader concentrates on watching the heat, with a shout he turns the crank,
Only to see a white dragon glittering, leaping forward like an arrow.
The ladle is instantly full of molten steel, the lab technician doesn't delay with his iron ladle,
Scooping out the steel for a close inspection, he can't help but smile with joy,
Facing the furnace chief, he praises repeatedly: another batch of high-quality steel, no small feat!
This electric furnace's past production wasn't so good, a big change from backwardness to advancement.
This is all thanks to the Party committee's leadership grasping the key, and also to the workers' soaring enthusiasm,
And also thanks to the new furnace chief leading the way to catch up with the advanced,
Since he came, the whole furnace's appearance has greatly changed.
Everyone praises the new furnace chief, Bai Shumao,
Working hard and delving deeply, not afraid of difficulties.
He originally led production at Electric Furnace No. 1,
Month after month, high quality and high output, never falling behind,
Not only was he a model producer in this factory,
But his name was spread at the National Conference of Heroes!
One day the general branch secretary came to him,
Shumao! I have something to discuss with you:
Electric Furnace No. 2 is far behind yours,
Truly, the ten fingers are not all the same,
The Party wants to send you to take on the role of furnace chief,
To drive the backward to advance together.
Bai Shumao's face filled with smiles upon hearing this:
A Communist Party member never bargains,
Wherever the Party calls, I will go,
No matter how heavy the burden, I will bear it.
He used his eyes to examine Electric Furnace No. 2 upon arriving,
Grass and ash accumulated thick and wide on the furnace top,
Under the furnace was a large pile of lime and scrap iron,
A messy, chaotic, hard to walk through.
He originally wanted to raise the issue immediately,
But then he thought it wasn't appropriate.
I'm new here and don't understand the situation,
Pointing fingers would cause trouble.
It's better to set an example with my own actions,
Using facts as education is better than empty talk.
He found a shovel and broom and started working,
Sweeping and loading for an entire day.
The furnace top and bottom were all cleaned up,
A clean and refreshing new look,
The workers saw the furnace chief leading by example,
And followed suit, happily cleaning up.
Bai Shumao spoke as he worked:
Everyone must keep sanitation work in mind,
Too much furnace ash shortens the furnace's lifespan,
Throwing tools around affects production safety.
Everyone said Bai Shumao's thoughts were comprehensive,
Truly deserving of the name "advanced," not a false reputation.
Leaving aside the workers' unanimous praise,
Let's talk about Bai Shumao's activity before the furnace.
When loading materials, he rushed to pick the large pieces first,
When repairing the furnace, he was the first to jump into the furnace to lay
bricks.
Leading by example in everything,
Not afraid of hardship, not afraid of difficulty.
In just a few days he became one with the workers,
Truly as close as water and milk, intimate and without gap.
One day at a post-shift meeting to sum up experiences,
Bai Shumao raised a question that was quite fresh:
"Why do some people ride bicycles fast and some slow?"
Everyone said: "Whoever has more energy takes the lead!"
"Electric Furnace No. 1 and us have the same conditions,
Why are they advanced and we are backward?"
Everyone said: "It can be seen that our enthusiasm is a little lacking,
To strive for the top, we must spur on our horses!"
Bai Shumao repeatedly said: Right, right, right, with great ambition, we can overcome difficulties.
After that, the production appearance changed,
The workers were energetic and worked happily.
Who knew that difficulties would come again,
The steelmaking materials were not as good as before.
Using substandard materials to make steel is much worse,
The steel output is low and it takes more time.
The group leader of Team A had opinions,
His heart did not like it when he saw the materials!
Bai Shumao asked him if he could produce high output,
He said that it would be difficult not to reduce production!
Bai Shumao reported to the Party general branch,
The general branch secretary urged him:
Specific problems must be solved specifically,
We must grasp the ideological work.
Bai Shumao replied that this was the case,
He would talk to the group leader in his spare time.
Once, at a cadre meeting, when talking about studying "Selected Works of Mao
Zedong,"
The group leader of Team A spoke,
He said that I have a copy of "On Protracted War,"
But I am a bit lost on how to study it.
Bai Shumao said that we must learn in connection with reality,
The principles of fighting a war and making steel are the same,
This book tells us how to win battles,
Mastering the laws can annihilate the enemy.
The group leader went home and read the book,
Studying it page by page.
Victory or defeat in war does not depend entirely on good weapons,
The human factor must be taken into account.
He thought to himself that production is also the same,
Emphasizing conditions is not right.
The more he thought, the more enlightened he became,
The next day, he spoke at the pre-shift meeting:
How can we win a battle if the raw materials are bad,
I hope everyone will offer more ideas and speak up.
Someone suggested picking up more scrap steel and scrap iron,
Mixing them in can overcome the difficulties.
Someone said that the steelmaking speed is slow,
We can save time in loading materials and shutting down the furnace.
Everyone said these methods were good,
Full of confidence and surging with energy.
When implemented, they were indeed very effective,
The output increased and the time was shortened.
Returning to the story of Bai Shumao,
There was something he couldn't figure out:
Even though the workers have great enthusiasm,
Competing with each other, one team better than the other,
But the output increase is still very slow,
What is the root cause of this?
He lived in the workshop to watch carefully,
Sending off Team A and following Team B,
After watching and watching, he finally discovered,
It turned out that the cooperation between the teams was not adequate.
Each team only cared about their own production being good,
But did not expect to leave difficulties for the next team,
Sometimes the furnace was burned out,
Sometimes the materials were not complete.
Once the problem was discovered, it was easy to solve,
Established a system of cooperation, one, two, three…
Each team established a global perspective,
You help me and I help you, working together forward!
In this way, the production situation greatly changed,
High quality and high output spread throughout the entire workshop.
In the factory-wide competition, they won a banner,
Furnace No. 2 ranked at the front.
Who doesn't praise the good furnace chief Bai Shumao,
Leading the backward to catch up with the advanced, with extraordinary ambition!

    壮志浇开胜利花（鼓词）
    易和元钢花飞舞在炉前，北京钢厂工人干得欢。组长聚精会神把火候看，一声招呼就扭动了转盘，只见一条白龙光闪闪，奔腾飞跃箭一般。钢水包一下就装满，化验员手拿铁杓不迟延，舀出钢水细观看，不由他喜在心头笑在眉尖，面对着炉长连声称赞：又是一炉优质钢可不简单！这电炉过去生产可不怎么好，由落后变先进大有渊源。这多亏党委领导抓关键，也多靠工人们干劲冲天，还多亏新炉长带头把先进赶，他一来全炉面貌大改观。新炉长白树茂大家都称赞，苦干深钻不怕困难。他原在一号电炉领导生产，月月优质高产不落后边，不单在本厂生产是模范，全国群英会上把名传！有一天总支书记把他找，树茂啊！有件事情和你谈：二号电炉比起你们差得远，真个是十个指头不一般，党想派你去把炉长担任，带动后进齐向前。白树茂一听笑满面：共产党员从不讲价钱，党叫到哪里就到哪里去，担子再重也承担。来到二号电炉他用眼看，炉顶上草灰积得厚又宽，炉底下石灰、废铁一大片，乱乱糟糟行路难。他本想把问题马上提出，又一想这样不妥善。我新来情况不了解，指手画脚那会出麻烦。倒不如以身作则做出样板，用事实作教育胜过空谈。他找来铁锹、扫帚就开干，又扫又装干了一整天。炉上炉下全都打扫干净，清清爽爽面目大改观，工人们看炉长带头示范，也跟着打扫卫生干得欢。白树茂边干活边把话讲：卫生工作大家要紧记心间，炉灰多炉子寿命短，工具乱扔会影响生产安全。大家伙都说白树茂想得全面，果不愧称先进名不虚传。且不表工人们同声称赞，再说那白树茂活跃在炉前。装料时他抢先把大块的拣，修炉时第一个跳进炉膛去砌
  砖。处处带头事事作模范，不怕艰苦不畏难。才几天就和工人们打成一片，真个是水乳交融亲密无间。有一天班后会上总结经验，白树茂提个问题可新鲜：“骑自行车为什么有的人快有
  人慢？”大家说：“谁个有劲谁占先！”“一号炉和我们是同样条件，为什么人家先进咱落后边？”大家说：“可见我们干劲差一
  点，争上游我们要快马加鞭！”白树茂连说：对对对，有大志一定能战胜困难。那以后生产面貌有改变，工人们生龙活虎干得欢。又谁知困难又来到，炼钢材料不如从前。次料炼钢差得远，出钢量少又费时间。甲班组长有意见，他一见材料心里不喜欢！白树茂问他能不能高产，他说是要不减产也困难！白树茂向党总支作了汇报，总支书记就向他叮咛一番：具体问题必须要具体解决，要抓住思想工作这一环。白树茂回说是这样，有空就和组长把心谈。有一次干部会上谈起学习《毛
  泽东选集》，甲班组长发了言，他说我有一本《论持久战》，怎样学我可是有点茫然。白树茂说必须联系实际来学
  习，打仗炼钢理一般，这本书告诉我们怎样打胜仗，掌握规律就能把敌歼。组长回家把书念，一页一页苦钻研。战争胜负不全靠武器好坏，人的因素必须要估计在里边。他心想生产也是一个样，强调条件理不端。他越想越乐开了窍眼，第二天班前会上把话谈：原材料不好怎样打胜仗，望大家多提办法多发言。有人提议多把废钢废铁拣，掺着使用就能够战胜困难。有人说炼钢速度慢，可以在装料停炉上面省时间。大家都说这些办法好，信心十足劲冲天。实行起来果然很灵验，产量提高缩短了时间。回书再表白树茂，有件事儿他想不穿：虽说是工人干劲大，你追我赶一班赛一班，可是产量提高还很慢，到底这是啥根源？他长住车间细观看，送走甲班又跟乙班，看来看去才发现，原来是各班协作不周全。各班都只顾自己生产好，却不料给下一班留下困难，有时炉子被烧坏，有时备料不齐全。问题发现就好办，订立了协作制度一二三……各个班都树立全局观点，你帮我我帮你合力向前！就这样生产形势大改变，优质高产红遍了整个车间。厂际评比获得了锦旗一面，二号炉名列在前边。好炉长白树茂谁不称赞，带后进赶先进壮志不凡！（附图片）
