Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, December 13th: The representatives attending the Tibet Autonomous Region's Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers, which opened on the 2nd, have been excitedly reporting at the congress in recent days about their advanced deeds in how they have achieved successes in agriculture, animal husbandry, and other fronts under the leadership of the Party.

In their speeches, the representatives all spoke about the decisive role of the Party's leadership in the development of various undertakings in Tibet. Losang Suolang, a representative from the Linggang District of Nimu County in the Lhasa area, said that it was because of the wise leadership of the Party that the vast number of emancipated peasants were able to establish the ambition to change their impoverished conditions, break with the old conventions of not winter plowing, not weeding, not selecting seeds, not treating diseases and insect pests, using little fertilizer, and little irrigation, and began to adopt advanced farming methods and relatively advanced production tools, which enabled agriculture to achieve a bumper harvest. Jiang Cuo, a representative from Bomi County in the Nyingchi area, said that relying on the collective strength of mutual aid groups, they built more than 100 irrigation canals, greatly improving water conservancy conditions and significantly increasing yields.

Representatives from pastoral areas spoke freely in their speeches about the thriving situation of animal husbandry production in Tibet. The survival rate of young livestock in many districts and townships reached 80% to 90%, an increase of 20% to 30% compared with the past. At present, the livestock of all kinds are in good condition, and great achievements have been made in protecting livestock through the winter and spring. In Nagqu Prefecture alone, nearly 10 million catties of winter grass have been stored since late October, and more than 100,000 large and small sheds have been built.

Representatives from the industrial transportation, finance and trade, political and legal, and cultural, educational, and health fronts also reported on their advanced deeds at the meeting.

In the past few days, the representatives also listened to the report by Apéi Ngawang Jigmé, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. In his report, he outlined the victories achieved in all aspects, especially in agricultural and animal husbandry production, since the democratic reform in Tibet a year ago, and called on all the people to resolutely implement the policy of "vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain" on the Tibetan plateau and to launch a high tide of agricultural and animal husbandry production centered on grain. The representatives also listened to the report "Strive to Vigorously Develop Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Production" made by Li Benshan, Deputy Director of the Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Department of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China. Pagbalha Geleg Namgyal, Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, also delivered a congratulatory speech to the congress on the 7th.

    新华社拉萨13日电　出席2日开幕的西藏全区先进集体和先进生产者代表大会的代表们，这几天在大会上兴奋地报告了他们在党的领导下，怎样在农业、牧业和其他战线上作出成绩的先进事迹。
    代表们在发言中都谈到了党的领导对西藏各项事业的发展的决定作用。拉萨地区尼木县林岗区代表洛桑索郎说，由于党的英明领导，才使广大翻身农民树立了改变贫困面貌的雄心壮志，打破了过去不冬耕、不除草、不选种、不治病虫害、少施肥、少灌水等陈规陋习，开始采用先进的耕作方法和比较先进的生产工具，使农业获得了丰收。林芝专区波密县的代表江措说，他们那里依靠互助组的集体力量，修了一百多条水渠，大大改善了水利条件，使产量有了显著增加。
    来自牧区的代表们在发言中畅谈了西藏牧业生产欣欣向荣的大好形势。许多区、乡幼畜成活率达80％至90％，比过去提高了20％至30％。目前各类牲畜的膘情很好，保畜过冬越春的工作也取得了很大成绩。仅那曲专区，从10月下旬到现在，已贮备冬草近一千万斤，还修盖了十万多个大小棚圈。
    来自工业交通、财贸、政法、文教卫生等战线上的代表们也在会上报告了自己的先进事迹。
    这几天中，代表们还听取了西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员兼秘书长阿沛·阿旺晋美的报告，他在报告中概述了西藏民主改革一年来各方面特别是农牧业生产方面所取得的胜利，号召全体人民坚决在西藏高原上贯彻“大办农业，大办粮食”的方针，掀起一个以粮食为中心的农牧业生产高潮。代表们还听取了中共西藏工委农牧部副部长李本善所作的“为大力发展农牧业生产而奋斗”的报告。西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员帕巴拉·卓列朗杰7日也向大会致了贺词。
