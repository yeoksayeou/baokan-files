    A Person's Beauty is Thought

    The beauty of birds lies in their wings, the beauty of people lies in their thoughts. The advanced individuals in various fields featured in today's "Glorious Posts, Glorious People" column are such people with lofty thoughts.

    The exemplary deeds of these advanced individuals fully demonstrate that as long as a person has ambition, nothing is impossible. This ambition is none other than putting proletarian revolutionary political thought in command, which can generate the driving force for people to forge ahead courageously. Some people in the Xiaoyuzhuang Production Team initially thought that changing from poor to rich was like a "frog in a well can't fly to the sky," and naturally, they couldn't generate the motivation to move forward. But the six "Iron Girls" were different. They firmly believed that relying on the Party and the People's Commune, "not only can the frog in the well fly to the sky, but the 'beggar's camp' can also be transformed into a happy village." The transformation of Xiaoyuzhuang Production Team from poor to rich precisely illustrates the victory of this kind of thinking.

    In the infinitely vast land of our great motherland, there are many people with great ambitions, soaring like the figures introduced in this column. The Party is the source of their strength. Wherever the Party points, they rush towards it, and wherever the difficulties are greatest, they go there to make revolution. They are glorious people. The glorious path they have taken should be the path that all ambitious and idealistic people strive towards.

### 人的美丽是思想

    人的美丽是思想
    鸟的美丽是翅膀，人的美丽是思想。本报今天“光荣的岗位，光荣的人”小专栏里所发表的几个方面的先进人物，就是这样的一些思想崇高的人。
    这些先进人物的模范事迹，充分地说明了，人，只要有志气，没有一件事情不会成功的。这个志气不是别的，就是无产阶级革命的政治思想挂帅，才能产生推动人们勇往直前的动力。小于庄生产队有一些人，开始对由穷变富认为是“井底蛤蟆飞不上天”，当然就不可能产生前进的动力；而六个“铁姑娘”不然，她们坚信：依靠党、依靠人民公社，“井底蛤蟆不仅能飞上天，而‘花子营’还能变成幸福庄”。小于庄生产队由穷变富，正是说明了这种思想的胜利。
    在我们伟大祖国无限广阔的天地上，有着许多胸怀大志的人们，他（她）们像这个专栏里所介绍的人物一样振翅翱翔。党是他（她）们力量的源泉，党指向哪里，他（她）们就奔向哪里，哪里最困难，他（她）们就到哪里去革命。他（她）们是光荣的人们。他（她）们所走的光荣道路，应该是一切有志气、有理想的人们奔向的道路。
