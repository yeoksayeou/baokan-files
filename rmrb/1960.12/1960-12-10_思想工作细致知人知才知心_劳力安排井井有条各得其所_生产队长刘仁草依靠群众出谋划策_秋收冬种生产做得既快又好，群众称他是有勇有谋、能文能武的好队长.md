    Fujian Minqing Bandong Commune Banxi Brigade's May 1st Production Team Leader and Branch Head Liu Rencao, in the work of autumn harvest and winter planting, not only closely relied on the masses, but also was good at using his brain, thinking hard, offering ideas and methods, arranging labor in an orderly manner, making autumn harvest and winter planting both fast and good. The commune members praised him as a "good captain with courage, wisdom, and both literary and military skills," and the commune party committee also issued a circular to commend him.

        To Use Soldiers, One Must First Know the Soldiers

    The May 1st Production Team originally had forty laborers, including fourteen full laborers and twenty-six semi-laborers. Recently, to further implement the policy of "vigorously developing agriculture and grain production," the team has added seven new members. How to give full play to everyone's role? Liu Rencao realized from practice that to lead production well, the first thing is to do a good job in human work. He especially valued doing a good job in the ideological work of the new members.

    One evening, when work was over, he heard that Liu Renzhuo, who had been working outside for six years, had returned home. After dinner, he ran to the new member's house. Just as he arrived at the entrance of the canteen, the two met face to face. Rencao said with a smile: "This time the old worker brother has also come to the front line of agriculture, we should give him a good welcome!" Liu Renzhuo also replied with a smile: "As soon as I heard about vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, I signed up to come back." The two talked and laughed, and Liu Rencao asked him what difficulties he had after returning. The other party replied: "I am young and strong, what difficulties could I have!" Liu Rencao continued to ask: "As the saying goes, 'The fist cannot leave the hand, and the song cannot leave the mouth.' You have been away from home for so many years, your agricultural skills must be rusty!" Liu Renzhuo still answered in one breath: "What's that, the first time is unfamiliar, the second time is familiar!" Although he said so, Liu Rencao repeatedly asked him what help he needed. Seeing that the production team leader was so enthusiastic, Liu Renzhuo was very moved, and couldn't help but quietly express his concerns. He said: "I am not afraid of the technology, but I am afraid that my labor cannot keep up with others." Seeing that the problem was brought out, Liu Rencao kindly comforted him and said: "The commune members are all discerning people. In the first few days, as long as you do your best, everyone will not ask too much. When we look at people, in addition to production skills, we pay more attention to the attitude of labor!" The next day, Liu Renzhuo went to the field with excitement. Indeed, his work efficiency was not high that day, cutting and threshing only more than one hundred and thirty catties. However, difficulties cannot stop those who are determined. By the third day, his work efficiency reached one hundred and seventy-six catties. This new member said: "After talking with the team leader, the sickle seemed to have been oiled, and it became smoother and smoother."

    In this way, through meticulous and patient work, Liu Rencao gradually found out the awareness, temper, physical strength, and skills of the new members. For example, Liu Yiguo, a young man who had just come out of school, had a lot of enthusiasm but poor skills, so he entrusted an old farmer to help him. Liu Yurong, who had been a boatman for more than ten years, had never worked in the fields, but he was good at growing vegetables, so he was assigned to the vegetable growing group. In this way, he both knew the talents and knew the hearts of the members, giving full play to everyone's active role.

    Seize the First Line Within the First Line

    Liu Rencao has a "think tank" around him, including party members, poor peasants, lower-middle peasant activists, and experienced old farmers Liu Shoudong, Liu Shouluan, Liu Quhai, and others. Usually, when something happens, he not only widely solicits opinions from the masses, but also discusses it with these five people. One day after breakfast, Liu Shoudong and Liu Shouluan came to him and reported that the labor force was not concentrated. Liu Rencao thought to himself, that's right! The same is true for autumn harvest and winter planting, there is also a first line within the first line. Like now, harvesting, threshing, plowing, preparing ridges, seed selection, sowing, drying stalks, stacking stalks, field management, logistics... there are dozens of links, but the most important are the four links of harvesting, threshing, plowing, and sowing. If harvesting and threshing are not done well, other links will be impossible to carry out; if plowing and sowing are not done well, the spring harvest next year will suffer losses. The most important labor force must be concentrated on these four most important links.

    How can we concentrate the labor force? Liu Rencao invited the members of the "think tank" to discuss together. Old farmer and communist party member Liu Chuanren first said:
  "We shout every day that agricultural work is tight and there is a shortage of manpower, but the two 'She Taijuns' next door to me are idle and have nothing to do. Like Lin Gongmei and Wang Xia Di, don't look at their age, if they are mobilized, they can really play a role!" Old farmer Liu Shouluan also said: "Field management is now very fragmented. If everyone uses their early morning and evening time to do it 'handily', can't the two 'old Huang Zhongs' of the field management team be spared?" In this way, you said a word and I said a word, the potential was tapped more and more, the methods were thought out more and more cleverly... The five people divided up the work and contracted it out, mobilizing the masses. Because they were good at tapping labor potential and cleverly arranging labor, in just a few days, the number of people in the whole team participating in harvesting and threshing increased from twenty to thirty-one, and the number of people plowing and planting also increased from four to nine. The strength of the most advanced troops in the autumn harvest and winter planting increased by 62%.

    Measuring Time by the Second, Not Underutilizing Talent

    But how can these dozens of commune members do the most things in the least amount of time? This is another move that Liu Rencao considered. He first arranged the nine party members, cadres, and activists in the team to work on the five fronts of harvesting, threshing, plowing, winter planting, and logistics, dividing up the work and contracting it out to drive other members; secondly, he sent the old members Liu Jingyu and Chen Xinwen, who had higher skills and were good at contacting the masses, to be responsible for the organization, liaison, and technical guidance of temporary support labor. He himself also participated in harvesting rice, threshing, drying grain, plowing fields, and other tasks in a planned way, so as to discover problems and solve them. Through labor, he also found that there was a waste of labor in drying straw, and immediately studied it with everyone and got a reasonable solution.

    The labor force for drying straw has been saved, but Liu Rencao is still thinking in his heart. He thought: "I found a waste of labor, could it be that others have not found it? I found a problem in one day of harvesting rice, haven't others found more problems in several days of harvesting?" Therefore, he invited the party members and the "think tank" again to jointly find loopholes in wasting labor. Sure enough, after this search, many loopholes were found again, and they were all solved one by one.

    Because ideological work and production organization are done well, the forty-seven laborers of the whole team are working harmoniously like a huge machine, and the songs of active cooperation are ringing everywhere.

    思想工作细致知人知才知心　劳力安排井井有条各得其所
    生产队长刘仁草依靠群众出谋划策
    秋收冬种生产做得既快又好，群众称他是有勇有谋、能文能武的好队长
    本报讯　福建闽清坂东公社坂西大队五一生产小队队长、支部负责人刘仁草，在秋收冬种的工作中，既紧密依靠群众，又善于开动脑筋，苦思多想，出主意想办法，把劳动力安排得井井有条，使秋收冬种做得既快又好。社员们称赞他是“有勇有谋、能文能武”的好队长，公社党委也通报表扬了他。
        用兵必先知兵
    五一生产小队原有劳力四十个，其中全劳力十四个、半劳力二十六个，最近进一步贯彻“大办农业大办粮食”的方针，队里又增加了七名新社员。怎样充分发挥所有人的作用呢？刘仁草从实践中体会到，要领导好生产，首先就要做好人的工作。他特别重视做好新社员的思想工作。
    一天傍晚收工的时候，他听说六年来一直在外做工的刘仁灼到家了，吃过晚饭就往这个新社员的家里跑。刚到食堂门口，两人就碰个照面。仁草笑嘻嘻地说：“这次工人老大哥也到农业第一线来了，可该好好欢迎一下啦！”刘仁灼也笑着回答：“我一听说大办农业大办粮食，就报名要回来。”两人边笑边谈，刘仁草问他回来后有什么困难。对方回答说：“我年轻力壮的，有什么困难！”刘仁草接着问：“俗话说‘拳不离手，曲不离口’，你离家这么多年，农业技术怕生疏了吧！”刘仁灼还是一口回答：“那有什么，头回生二回就熟嘛！”话虽这么说，刘仁草还是再三询问他需要什么帮助。刘仁灼见生产小队长这么热情，很受感动，不禁就低声地把自己的顾虑说了出来。他说：“技术倒不怕，就怕自己劳动赶不上别人。”刘仁草见问题摆出来了，就亲切地安慰他说：“社员都是明眼人，头几天，只要你尽力干，大家也不会要求很高的。我们看人，除了生产技术，更重要的是看劳动态度呢！”第二天，刘仁灼带着兴奋的心情下田了，这一日他工效果然不高，连割带打只一百三十多斤。可是，困难拦不住有心人，到第三天，他工效就达到一百七十六斤。这个新社员说：“同队长谈话后，镰刀像抹过了油，越割越顺手。”
    就这样，刘仁草通过细致耐心的工作，逐个摸清了新社员们的觉悟、脾气、体力、技术。如刚从学校出来的小伙子刘宜国，干劲足、技术差，就委托老农来帮助他。当了十几年船工的刘裕容，田里活没做过，种菜却有一套，就分配他去种菜组。这样，对社员既知才又知心，充分发挥了每个人的积极作用。
    第一线里再抓第一线
    刘仁草身边有个“智囊团”，包括党员、贫农、下中农积极分子和有经验的老农刘守栋、刘守銮、刘曲海等五人。平日有事，他一面广泛征求群众意见；一面和这五人商量。那天吃过早饭，刘守栋、刘守銮来找他，反映劳动力不集中。刘仁草一想，对呀！同样是秋收冬种，第一线里还有个第一线。像现在收割、脱粒、犁田、整畦、选种、播种、晒秆、堆秆、田间管理、后勤……环节不下几十个，可是最主要的还是收、打、犁、种四个环节。收割脱粒搞不好，其他环节就无从进行；犁田播种搞不好，明年春收就会受损失。必须把最主要的劳力，集中到这四个最主要的环节上来。
    怎样才能集中劳力呢？刘仁草把“智囊团”的成员请了来共同商量。老农、共产党员刘川仁首先说：
  “我们天天嚷农活紧、人手缺，可是我隔壁两位‘佘太君’却闲着没事干，像林拱妹、王夏俤，别看她们年纪大，要是动员起来，真顶得个角色呢！”老农刘守銮也说：“田间管理现在活路很零碎，要是大家利用早晚时间‘顺手牵羊’干一下，田间管理队的两个‘老黄忠’不是又可以省下来？”这样你一言我一语，潜力越挖越多，办法越想越巧，……五个人分工包干，发动群众。由于善于挖掘劳动潜力，巧妙安排劳力，不几天，全队参加收打的劳力，就由二十人增加到三十一人，犁、种劳力也由四人增加到九人。秋收冬种最前沿的兵力，增添了62％。
    分秒量着用　大材不小用
    可是怎样让这几十个社员用最少的时间，干最多的事情呢？这是刘仁草考虑的另一着棋。他首先把小队里的九个党员、干部、积极分子，分别安排在收割、脱粒、犁田、冬种、后勤等五条战线，分工包干，带动其他社员；其次又派技术较高、善于联系群众的老社员刘景玉、陈新文，负责对临时支援劳力的组织、联络和技术指导工作。自己也有计划地参加了割稻、脱粒、晒谷、犁田等项劳动，以便从中发现问题解决问题。通过劳动，他又发现晒草时有浪费劳动力的现象，立即和大家一块研究，得到合理解决。
    晒草的劳力是节省了，可是刘仁草的心里还在做文章。他想：“我发现了浪费劳力现象，难道别人就没有发现？我割稻一天就发现一个问题，别人割了好几天，难道就不能发现更多的问题？”因此他又把党员、“智囊团”请了来，共同找浪费劳力的漏洞。果然，这一找，漏洞又发现了不少，都一个一个地解决了。
    由于思想工作和生产组织搞得好，全队四十七个劳力，像一架庞大的机器一样和谐地工作着，处处响起主动协作的歌声。
