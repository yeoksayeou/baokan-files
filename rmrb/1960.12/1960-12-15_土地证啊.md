Land Certificates, Ah...
　　Wen Jian

　　A thousand conch shells sound at once, ten thousand golden bells chime together, at this moment, every wave in the river is dancing, every pine tree on the snowy mountain is singing... Ah, what great thing has happened on our grassland?

　　What are the old serfs holding in their hands? What are the old grannies carrying on their heads? Ah, they are land certificates. Land certificates issued by the peasant associations, land certificates issued by the People's Government!

　　The land certificate is framed with colors as bright as the彩霞; on the land certificate, the amount of land distributed and the name of its owner are written in both Han and Tibetan languages; in the very center, against the background of the five-star red flag, is printed our great leader Chairman Mao, like the rising sun, shining brightly! …

　　The great democratic reform, with an invincible golden axe, smashed the heinous slavery, and returned freedom, the blue sky, songs, and land to the serfs who had broken their chains. Turn over the thousands of volumes of scriptures in the Great Golden Temple, and you won't find a page of history like today. Ah, this is the first great happy event on the grassland since the beginning of time!

　　The serfs thronged to the peasant associations, where red flags were like the sea and sheng and drums were played in unison. The serfs thronged to the peasant associations, like the tide in March, the dense clouds in September, every footprint filled with joyful laughter. They went to receive the most precious thing in their lives—land!

　　Look, the old serf Dunzhu shakes his white hair, tears streaming down his face, he presses the brand-new land certificate tightly against his chest, closing his eyes in rapture. Listen, he pulls out such sentences from his heart: "Thank you, father! Thank you, Chairman Mao! I know this isn't a dream..."

　　Look, the old granny Nima is jumping and shouting while holding the land certificate, like a mischievous child, beaming and reciting the golden words on it to everyone she meets: "Nine khet, this is my nine khet of land! Headmen and Tusi can no longer take it away!..." She raised her head and laughed, the bright sun shining on her face full of transparent teardrops...

　　Look, the blind Dorje touches the land certificate with trembling hands, solemnly and slowly unfolding this rustling paper. Suddenly, a miracle appears. His eyes, which have been dull and lifeless for decades due to labor and rent, flash with joy in an instant! Then, he holds up the land certificate, gazing at it for a long time, gazing at it... He asks in an excited voice that only he can hear: "Fellow villagers! What do I see!? Ah!?" Finally, he shouts wildly like a mountain torrent erupting: "Heavens! I see it, I see Chairman Mao!"

　　Look, the young serfs first clasp their hands to congratulate each other, and then playfully nudge each other, no one can hear their own and the other's intermittent words clearly. But, a huge sonic wave is reverberating throughout the grassland: "Land! We have land!..."

　　What a scene this is! The serfs holding land certificates run to the vast highland barley fields and flax lands in the north and south of the snow-capped mountains. Now, every piece of land inlaid with black gemstones is full of wooden stakes tied with hada, with the name of the owner of the land written on it. And before the democratic reform, these names were firmly recorded in the register of the serf owners. Yes, Gebu is still Gebu, Zhuoma is still Zhuoma, the difference is that yesterday's pariahs have become today's masters!

　　What's wrong with Sonam? Look, he bends down, softly and proudly reciting his name on the wooden stake, as if he has had a name for the first time in his life. What's wrong with Zhaxi? Look, he kneels down, solemnly holding a handful of soil, smelling it, smelling it, closing his eyes happily, and kissing it on his thick lips. What's wrong with Luodan? Look, he grabs oily clods of earth, like holding handfuls of gold, and laughs "hehehe." Oh, what's wrong with these young serfs? Look, they are chasing each other, pushing and shoving, laughing and rolling in the fields…

　　Yes, yes, the land irrigated by the hot blood and transparent sweat of generations of serfs has finally returned to the hands of this first generation of free people! Land, blossoming land, land so fertile that it drips with oil, land bathed in the socialist sunshine, today exudes a intoxicating fragrance that only serfs can understand, opening its sky-wide chest to embrace its masters who have smashed their shackles and buried their suffering!

　　Look, in the rough hands of millions of serfs, are land certificates radiating golden light; look, the powerful feet of millions of serfs are walking briskly towards the communist future. The heinous slavery has been destroyed, the cannibalistic code has been abolished, the cruel instruments of torture have been smashed, the thick registers have been burned, and a towering class stands tall and awe-inspiring before the statue of Chairman Mao!

　　Tomorrow, on this flowering land full of wooden stakes, there will be wheat waves whistling and golden waves rolling, and thousands of miracles will rise with the sun! Tomorrow, huge oil refineries, sparkling hydropower stations, and towering steel furnaces…will also be born in the footsteps of these serfs! The Tibetan people will join the people of the motherland, breaking through clouds and fog, and completing twenty years of progress in one day!

    土地证啊……
    文健
    一千只海螺同时吹响了，一万座金钟同时敲动了，此刻，江河里的每一片浪花都在跳动，雪山上的每一株松树都在唱歌……呵，我们的草原上发生了什么大事情？
    老农奴们手中捧着的是什么？老阿奶们头上顶着的是什么？呵，是土地证。是农民协会颁发的土地证，是人民政府颁发的土地证！
    土地证的四周，是用彩霞一样鲜艳的色彩镶成的框子；土地证上，用汉、藏两种文字写着土地的分配数量，和它主人的姓名；在正中央，在五星红旗的背景上，印着我们伟大的领袖毛主席，犹如初升旭日，光华万丈！……
    伟大的民主改革，用无敌的金斧子劈碎了万恶的奴隶制，把自由、蓝天、歌声和土地，都还给了挣脱锁链的农奴们。翻遍大金寺千万卷经文，找不到一页像今天这样的历史。呵，这是开天辟地以来，草原上的第一件大喜事！
    农奴们拥向农民协会，那里，红旗如海，笙鼓齐鸣。农奴们拥向农民协会，像三月的潮水，九月的密云，每个脚印里都填满了欢乐的笑声。他们去领取一生中最珍贵的东西——土地！
    看呵，老农奴顿珠摇着满头白发，热泪纵横，他把那张崭新的土地证紧紧贴着胸口，沉醉地闭上了眼睛。听，他从自己的心坎里，掏出了这样的句子：“谢谢阿爹！谢谢毛主席！我知道，这不是在梦里……”
    看呵，老阿奶尼玛捧着土地证边跳边嚷，像个调皮的孩子，逢人便眉飞色舞地念着那上面的金字：“九克地，这是属于我的九克地！头人、土司再也抢不去了！……”她仰起头笑了，大太阳照着她满脸透明的泪滴……
    看呵，瞎眼的多吉用颤抖的手抚摸着土地证，庄重而缓慢地展开了这张索索作响的纸。突然，一个奇迹出现了。他那双几十年来被劳役和租税折磨得浑沌无光的眼珠，一霎时闪射出了喜悦的光辉！然后，他捧起那张土地证，久久地凝视着，凝视着……他用自己才能听见的激动的嗓音问道：“乡亲们！我看见什么啦！？呵！？”终于，他像山洪爆发般地狂呼起来：“天哪！我看见了，我看见了毛主席！”
    看呵，年轻的农奴们先是拱手互相祝福，而后又彼此亲昵地敲打着，谁也听不清自己和对方的断断续续的话语。但，整个草原上却震荡着一股巨大的音浪：“土地！我们有了土地！……”
    这是一个什么样的场面呵！手捧土地证的农奴们前呼后拥地奔向雪山南北辽阔的青稞田和亚麻地。如今，在每片用黑宝石镶成的土地上，都满插着系着哈达的木牌，上面写着这片土地的主人的姓名。而在民主改革前，这些名字还被牢牢地记在农奴主的花名册上。是的，格布还是格布，卓玛还是卓玛，不同的是，昨天的贱民变成了今天的主人！
    索南是怎么了？你看，他弯下腰，轻声地，而又是自豪地念着那木牌上自己的名字，好像他这一生第一次有了个名字一样。扎西是怎么了？你看，他跪下来，庄重地捧起一手的泥土，闻着，闻着，幸福地闭上了眼睛，放在他厚厚的嘴唇上亲吻。洛丹是怎么了？你看，他抓起油亮的土块，像举着大把的黄金，“嘿嘿嘿”地笑出了声。哎呀，这些年轻的农奴又是怎么了？看呵，他们互相追逐着，推打着，哗笑着，在地里打滚……
    是呵，是呵，千百代农奴用滚烫的血，透明的汗浇灌起来的土地，今天终于回到这第一代自由人的手里了！土地，开花的土地，肥得要流油的土地，沐浴着社会主义阳光的土地呵，今天散发着一阵阵只有农奴才能理解的醉人的芳香，袒开了天空一样宽阔的胸怀，拥抱自己砸碎枷锁，埋葬了苦难的主人！
    看呵，千万农奴粗壮的大手里，捧着金光四射的土地证；看呵，千万农奴有力的双脚，步步生风，向着共产主义的前途飞快地走去。万恶的奴隶制被摧毁了，吃人的法典被废除了，残酷的刑具被砸碎了，厚厚的花名册被烧毁了，一个顶天立地的阶级，在毛主席的巨像前，威风凛凛地站起来了！
    明天，就在这插满木牌的、开花的土地上将会麦浪呼啸，金波乱滚，将有千万个奇迹随着太阳上升！明天，巨大的炼油厂，闪光的水电站，巍巍的钢炉群……也将在这农奴们奔跑过的脚迹里诞生！藏族人民将和祖国人民一道，穿云破雾，一天走完二十年的路程！
