Sichuan No. 1 Cotton Mill Relies on the Masses to Rationally Allocate Labor
Achieving 19% Labor Savings and Reducing Non-Production Personnel to 7.4%

    (Our dispatch) Sichuan First Cotton Textile Factory launched a vigorous mass movement to tap labor potential. In just over twenty days, the factory has already saved 19% of its labor force, reducing non-production personnel to 7.4%.
    The work of saving labor in this factory began after the Party Central Committee called for vigorously developing agriculture and grain production. Initially, some cadres said, "We are a newly built factory, and production will expand in the future, so it's hard to say if there is any potential now." Others said, "It's easy to do work now, and it looks like there is potential, but in the future, when it is not so easy, this amount of people may not be enough." The more common idea among cadres was "it's easier to get things done with more people." The factory Party committee analyzed the ideological situation at the time and believed that relying solely on management cadres sitting in the office to calculate accounts would not allow them to fully understand the situation. Saving labor is a major matter related to every employee in the factory. To clarify the potential and do a good job in this area, they must rely on the masses of employees and launch a vigorous mass movement.
    The factory Party committee, on the one hand, organized cadres to study relevant documents, clarify policies, and unify their thinking. On the other hand, through cadre meetings, Party member and Communist Youth League member meetings, and employee meetings, mobilized at all levels, extensively discussed the great significance of saving labor and strengthening the front line of agricultural production, criticized the conservative thinking of a few cadres, and let go of mobilizing the masses to launch a heated debate, forming a mass upsurge of calculating the waste of labor and finding and digging up labor potential. Workers in the fine spinning workshop and cloth yard had a further understanding of saving labor in accounting. It is generally believed that: (1) Too many people lead to low levels of tending machines (spindles), which cannot promote workers' active improvement of technical skills, and also encourages the erroneous practice of a few cadres attempting to rely on more people to complete tasks. (2) Excessive personnel increases the number of assistant workers, resulting in mutual dependence between tending workers and assistant workers, unclear responsibilities, and affecting the further improvement of production levels. (3) Poor organization of labor with too many people often affects work and unity. (4) Too few tasks for too many people can easily lead to lax labor discipline. Initially, the management cadres of the cloth yard calculated an account, stating that more than fifty laborers could be saved under the existing equipment conditions. After a period of study, a second calculation was made, and the labor savings increased to one hundred and two. However, after the mass calculation, the labor savings further increased. In addition to increasing the number of cloth machines by one hundred and two and adding two shifts, more than ninety laborers could still be saved. The workers said that a few people sitting in the office to calculate only saw things but not people. When everyone calculates, they can include the subjective initiative of people.
    The mass calculation of detailed accounts not only quickly clarified the factory's labor potential but also gave the vast number of cadres and employees a vivid and concrete education in increasing production, practicing economy, and supporting agriculture.

### 川棉一厂依靠群众合理安排劳力  已节约劳动力19％非生产人员降低到7.4％

    川棉一厂依靠群众合理安排劳力
    已节约劳动力19％非生产人员降低到7.4％
    本报讯　四川第一棉纺织厂大搞群众运动，狠挖劳动潜力，二十多天中，全厂已节约劳动力19％，非生产人员降低到7.4％。
    这个厂节约劳动力的工作是从党中央号召大办农业、大办粮食以后开始的。起初，有的干部说：“我们是新建厂，将来生产还要扩大，现在很难说有什么潜力了。”也有的说：“现在活路好做，看起来有潜力，以后活路不好做了，这点人恐怕还不够。”在干部中比较普遍存在的思想是“人多好办事”。工厂党委分析了当时的思想情况，认为，只靠管理干部坐在办公室里算账，是把底子摸不清的；节约劳动力是关系到全厂每个职工的大事，要弄清潜力，搞好这项工作，只有依靠全厂职工群众，大搞群众运动。
    工厂党委一面组织干部学习了有关文件，明确政策，统一思想，一面通过干部会，党员、团员会和职工会等，层层进行动员，大讲节约劳动力、加强农业生产第一线的重大意义，批判了少数干部的保守思想，放手发动群众，开展热烈的鸣放辩论，形成了群众性的大算劳动力浪费账，寻找挖掘劳动潜力的热潮。细纱车间和布场的工人在算账中，对节约劳动力有了进一步的认识。普遍认为：（一）人多了，看台（锭）水平低，不能促进工人积极提高技术水平，并且助长少数干部企图依靠人多来完成任务的错误作法。（二）人员过多，增加了帮车工，结果是值车工和帮车工互相依赖，责任不清，影响生产水平的进一步提高。（三）人员多劳动力组织不好，往往还会影响工作和团结。（四）人多事少，容易造成劳动纪律松弛现象。布场最初由管理干部算了一笔账，在现有设备的条件下，可以节约五十多个劳动力。经过一段时间的学习以后，又算了第二次账，节约的劳动力增加到一百零二个。但是经过群众性的算账以后，节约的劳动力又有了更大的增加，除了增开一百零二台布机、增开两个班次以外，还可以节约九十多个劳动力。职工们说，少数人坐在办公室里算账，只见物不见人，大家算账，就可以把人的主观能动作用都算进去。
    群众性的算细账，不但很快弄清了全厂劳动潜力的底子，而且使广大干部和职工受到了一次生动具体的增产节约和支援农业的教育。
