Advancing on the Road to Knowledge
	Daring to Make Revolution in Production
	Also Daring to Make Revolution in Culture

	Wang Baojing, a national agricultural labor model and young peasant scientist, went to the Northwest Agricultural College to study agricultural science and technology in February of this year, along with several young men who were working with him on high-yield experiments.

	It is a revolution for peasants to go to university. Wang Baojing and others were determined to attack the fortress of scientific knowledge like storming a pillbox. Although there were many difficulties ahead, such as having to make up middle school courses on the basis of primary school or even less education before they could study university courses... However, difficulties cannot scare these people who dare to make revolution in production and also dare to make revolution in culture.

	When they started learning, they used the wrong learning methods, simply memorizing things by rote. This term, that concept, the more they learned, the more difficult it became. Often they worked late into the night and still couldn't solve the problems. Some of their partners began to waver, and Wang Baojing's heart wasn't at ease either, but he didn't want to drop out. He knew that this wasn't just a matter of whether one person could learn well or not, but a major matter of how to open up the road for peasants to learn science. He thought, "What exactly is separating the peasants from scientific theory?" With the enlightenment of the college's Party committee, they found learning methods in Chairman Mao's works and discovered that practice—theory—practice is the broad road to learning theoretical knowledge. Wang Baojing and his partners proposed to break through the "five barriers" (terminology barrier, note-taking barrier, calculation barrier, experiment barrier, theory barrier) and master the "five grasps" (grasp the key points, grasp the practical, grasp the comparison, grasp the relationship, grasp the application), and formed mutual aid groups to help each other and improve together. After adopting these methods, they gradually began to get rid of the difficulties in learning. One day, Wang Baojing was reviewing chemical compound molecular formula reactions. From morning to noon, he couldn't figure it out. When he realized that these molecular formulas were closely related to agricultural production, he became even more determined to figure them out. He calculated one molecular formula after another, and finally succeeded.

	Through hard work, Wang Baojing and his partners finally completed the basic courses of middle school and university, such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, and botany. From not understanding to understanding and applying, from applying to innovating, they have always combined theory with practice. During the learning process, they often wrote to the commune to improve various experimental contents and methods, and they also gained a deeper theoretical understanding of the high-yield experiments they had done in the past. Now Wang Baojing and others have entered the study of professional basic courses and professional courses.

	Worker-Peasant-Soldier News

	Sing Praises of the Motherland for Ten Thousand Years

	Worker-peasant-soldier writer Gao Yuobao is now a third-year student in the Journalism Department of Renmin University of China. Two years ago, he spent four years completing the twelve years of middle and primary school courses and then graduated from the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Middle School of Renmin University. When he was admitted to the Journalism Department of Renmin University, he excitedly wrote a quick-rhythm poem:

	Now workers and peasants study journalism,
	Want to be reporters and run newspapers.
	Break superstitions and be bold,
	Be a hero on the journalism front.
	Study diligently and learn with humility,
	Will not stop until I'm both red and expert.
	Newspaper propaganda is a good weapon,
	Reporters are the Party's propagandists.
	I am determined to study journalism,
	Sing praises of the motherland for ten thousand years.

	Gao Yuobao entered the university with a passion for knowledge, wanting to swallow all the good things at once, but almost every university course was unfamiliar to him, and learning roadblocks followed one after another. In order to work better for the Party, he was not afraid of difficulties blocking his way. He thought: I rose from suffering, and have tasted all kinds of difficulties and hardships. As long as I listen to the Party, study hard, and ask questions when I don't understand, there is no knowledge that I cannot learn. When studying "Logic," in order to understand the meaning and relationship of the two terms "extension" and "intension," he humbly asked the teacher for advice and discussed and studied with his classmates. After repeated thinking, he finally understood.

	In his studies, Gao Yuobao especially valued political theory courses. He thought: As a Party propagandist, without a correct worldview and without mastering theoretical weapons, he cannot do a good job. He always carefully read the assigned classics and textbooks, and also took time to read some popular philosophy books and other reference books.

	Gao Yuobao still loves physical labor in his studies. He often participates in labor activities organized by the school and performs well in every labor. In 1958, the Journalism Department established a printing factory. Gao Yuobao and his classmates built the factory while working. In this factory, he not only learned photography plate-making technology, but also worked as a furnace worker, electrician, carpenter, mason, and painter, learning a lot of knowledge that cannot be learned from books.

	Not Afraid of Many Difficulties with a Red Heart

	Early in the morning, the campus of Peking University is peaceful and quiet. In a corner of the campus, there are bursts of foreign language reading. Who gets up so early to study? It turns out to be Tan Haiquan, a third-year student in the Department of Chemistry and a Communist Party member.

	Learning a foreign language is still a new subject for this young man who just graduated from the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Middle School. Tan Haiquan found it most difficult to remember Russian words. People said that it was because of his poor memory and he was destined not to learn it, but Tan Haiquan said with confidence: "Poor memory can be exercised. The reason why I can't remember Russian words for a while is because I haven't seen them enough and the impression is not deep enough. As long as I put in more effort, I will always remember them." From then on, he always carried a vocabulary book in his pocket and took it out to read whenever he had time.

	Tan Haiquan's difficulties in learning are not limited to Russian. Studying mathematics and chemistry requires him to put in a lot of effort. However, no matter what difficulties he faced, they did not shake his confidence and determination in learning. In order to work better for the Party in the future, he is determined not to give up until he completes the learning tasks assigned to him by the Party. In the classroom, he listened attentively, and after class, he seized the time to review. Tan Haiquan was originally a combat hero of the Volunteer Army. After going to school, he continued to maintain the heroic qualities of a Volunteer Army soldier who is not afraid of difficulties, both in thought and action.

    在知识化道路上迈进
    敢于在生产上闹革命
    也敢于在文化上闹革命
    全国农业劳动模范、青年农民科学家王保京，是在今年2月到西北农学院去学习农业科学技术的，和他同去的还有一起搞丰产试验的几个小伙子。
    农民上大学是一个革命，王保京等下定了决心要像攻碉堡一样，把科学知识的堡垒攻下来。虽然面前摆着许多困难，如要在小学或不及小学程度的基础上，补习中学课程后才能学习大学课程……。可是，困难吓不倒这些敢于在生产上闹革命，也敢于在文化上闹革命的人。
    他们开始学习的时候，由于学习方法不对头，只是死背硬记，这个名词，那个概念，越学越难，经常搞到深夜还不能解决问题。伙伴中有的人开始动摇了，王保京的心里也不松快，可是他没有想退学，他知道这不是一个人学好学坏的事，而是如何打开农民学科学的道路的大事。他想：“到底有什么东西把农民和科学理论隔着呢？”经过学院党委的启发，他们在毛主席的著作中找到了学习方法，发现实践—理论—实践，是学习理论知识的阳关大道。王保京和他的伙伴们提出了要攻破“五关”（名词关、笔记关、计算关、实验关、理论关）和学习“五抓”（抓重点、抓实际、抓对比、抓关系、抓应用），并且组成了互助组，互相帮助，共同提高。采取这些方法后，他们逐渐地开始摆脱了学习上的困境。有一天，王保京做化合物分子式反应复习，从早上到中午，也没有演算出名堂来，当他晓得这些分子式和农业生产有密切关系时，更下了狠心一定要演算出来。他演算了一个又一个分子式，最后终于演算成功了。
    经过刻苦学习，王保京和他的伙伴们终于学完了中学、大学的数学、物理、化学、植物等基础课。他们从不懂到懂和运用，从运用到革新，一直是把理论与实践结合起来的。在学习过程中，他们经常给公社写信，改进各种试验内容和方法，而且对自己过去搞的丰产试验，在理论上也有了进一步的认识。现在王保京等已经进入专业基础课和专业课的学习了。
    工农学新闻
    歌颂祖国万万年
    工农兵作家高玉宝现在是中国人民大学新闻系三年级的学生。两年前，他用了四年的时间学完了中、小学十二年的课程后，就从人民大学工农速成中学毕业了。当他考取人民大学新闻系的时候，他很激动地写了一首快板诗：
    如今工农学新闻，
    要当记者把报办。
    破除迷信大胆干，
    新闻战线比好汉。
    苦心钻研虚心学，
    不红不专心不干。
    报纸宣传好武器，
    记者是党的宣传员。
    我要决心学新闻，
    歌颂祖国万万年。
    高玉宝满怀着渴求知识的热情进了大学，真想把所有好的东西都一下子吞进肚里去，可是大学的课程几乎门门对他都是生疏的，学习上的拦路虎一个跟着一个。为了更好地为党工作，他不怕困难挡道。他想：自己是从苦难中爬起来的，什么困难什么苦都尝过，只要听党的话，刻苦钻研，不懂就问，没有学不到的知识。在学“逻辑学”时，为了弄通“外延”和“内涵”两个词的意义和关系，他虚心地向老师请教，和同学讨论研究，经过反复思考，终于弄明白了。
    在学习中，高玉宝特别重视政治理论课程，他想：作为一个党的宣传员，没有正确的世界观，不掌握理论武器，是做不好工作的。他总是认真地阅读指定的经典著作和教材，而且还抽空阅读一些哲学通俗读本和其他参考书。
    高玉宝在学习中仍然热爱体力劳动。他经常参加学校组织的一些劳动活动，在每次劳动中都表现得很出色。1958年，新闻系办了一个印刷厂，高玉宝和同学们一面建厂，一面工作。在这个厂子里，他不但学会了照相制版技术，而且还当炉匠、电工、木匠、泥瓦匠和油漆工等，学得了许多书本上学不到的知识。
    心红那怕困难多
    清晨，北京大学校园里一片恬静，在校园的一角，传出了阵阵朗读外文的声音。是谁这么早就起来读书呢？原来是化学系三年级学生，共产党员谭海泉。
    学习外文，对于这个刚刚由工农速成中学毕业的青年人来说还是一个新的课题。谭海泉最感到困难的是记不住俄文单字。人家说这是记忆力不好，注定学不会，但谭海泉却满有信心地说：“记忆力不好可以锻炼，俄文单字一时记不住是因为见得少、印象不深，只要多下功夫，总有记住的时候。”从此，他的衣袋里总是装着单字本，一有空他就拿出来念。
    谭海泉在学习上的困难不仅仅是俄文。学习数学、化学，哪一门功课都要他付出很大的劳动。可是，不管什么困难都没有动摇他学习的信心和决心。为了将来更好地为党工作，他决心不完成党交给他的学习任务决不罢休。在课堂上，他全神贯注地听讲，课后就抓紧时间复习。谭海泉原是一个志愿军战斗英雄，上学以后，他从思想上到行动上，还继续保持着一个志愿军战士不畏艰难的英雄本色。
