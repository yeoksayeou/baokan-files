Topdressing with Urine Fertilizer Promotes Rooting and Tillering of Re-cropped Wheat
Our Reporter

Urine-soaked re-cropped wheat, seedlings grow as if hand-pulled
How effective is using human urine on wheat? The Wheat High-Yield Group of the Northwest Soil Biology Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences conducted an investigation in Shangzhai Production Team, Yujin Commune, Lintong. A large amount of comparative investigation material further confirmed that human urine is indeed a high-quality and fast-acting fertilizer. Using human urine on wheat is a key measure to promote the rooting and tillering of re-cropped wheat. The commune members recognized and affirmed the benefits of using human urine on wheat from vivid facts. Someone composed a quick verse describing it: "Urine-soaked re-cropped wheat, seedlings grow as if hand-pulled, roots take hold like arrows, yielding a stone and a half per mu." Through investigation and research, the movement of using urine on re-cropped wheat here was pushed to a new climax. Before November 28th, the entire team used urine on more than ten mu of wheat every day; after the 28th, it rose sharply to more than thirty mu. By December 8th, of the 1,200 mu of poorly growing re-cropped wheat in the entire team, 632 mu had been treated with urine.

Shangzhai Production Team started using human urine on wheat in 1957. Over the past three years, under the same soil conditions and farming practices, the average yield per mu of re-cropped wheat treated with human urine was about 70 jin higher than that of re-cropped wheat that was not treated.

After the beginning of winter this year, this team continued to use this successful experience to carry out the urine-soaked wheat movement. The Wheat High-Yield Group of the Northwest Soil Biology Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (hereinafter referred to as the Wheat High-Yield Group) also conducted careful investigations in eight locations and twenty-three wheat fields in seven natural villages and production team experiment stations in Shangzhai, Nanshangzhai, and Huihe Village of Shangzhai Production Team. The investigation results clearly showed that urine-soaked wheat played a significant role in promoting the tillering and rooting of re-cropped wheat.

On average, each urine-soaked wheat plant had two tillers and 1.7 secondary roots. Plants without urine application had an average of only 1.2 tillers, 0.8 fewer. Single plants had only 0.6 secondary roots, 1.1 fewer. Based on the experience that the number of tillers before winter is closely related to the number of effective tillers in the coming year, wheat treated with urine laid a good foundation for re-cropped wheat to catch up with and surpass regular wheat; and for third-class wheat to catch up with and surpass first-class wheat.

Soaking is better than not soaking, soaking early is better than soaking late

Is it better to soak early or late? Is it better to only soak early-sown re-cropped wheat or to first soak late-sown re-cropped wheat? According to the investigation by the Wheat High-Yield Group in the wheat field of the team's experiment station, soaking early is better than soaking late. Wheat treated with urine on November 12 had an average of 2.67 tillers (including the main stem), 3.5 secondary roots per plant, 8.5 leaves per plant, and a plant height of 21.1 cm. Wheat treated with urine on November 18 had the same average number of tillers as on the 12th, but only 2.4 secondary roots per plant, 6.5 leaves per plant, and a plant height of 18.8 cm. Wheat treated with urine on November 27 had an average of only 1.83 tillers (including the main stem), 1.4 secondary roots per plant, 5.6 leaves per plant, and a plant height of 18.3 cm. Whether it is early-sown or late-sown re-cropped wheat, the effect of urine soaking is very good, especially the effect of early soaking. According to the investigation of four wheat fields, early-sown wheat on October 7, treated with urine, had an average of 2.1 tillers per plant, 0.9 more tillers per plant than wheat that was not treated with urine. Urine-soaked single plants had 2.2 secondary roots, one more than single plants that were not treated with urine. Late-sown wheat on October 23, treated with urine, had an average of 1.49 tillers per plant, while those not treated with urine had only 1.02. Urine-soaked single plants had 1.2 secondary roots, while those not treated with urine had only 0.3.

Why is urine fertilizer so effective?

Why can using urine on wheat produce such obvious effects? After careful analysis by the Wheat High-Yield Group and soil experts from Beishangzhai Team, they believe that: First, human urine is a complete fertilizer. According to tests, human urine usually contains 0.5% nitrogen, 0.13% phosphoric acid, and 0.1% potassium oxide. In this way, 1,000 jin of human urine is equivalent to 25 to 30 jin of ammonium sulfate. Second, human urine is a fast-acting fertilizer that is easily absorbed and utilized by plants. Third, human urine contains growth stimulants that are beneficial to plants, which can promote the growth and development of wheat. In order to verify the correctness of these arguments, the Wheat High-Yield Group and the local and foreign experts from Beishangzhai once again went deep into the fields to take samples for analysis. The nitrogen content in early-soaked wheat is more than one-third higher than that in late-soaked wheat. Late soaking also has obvious effects. When sampling and analyzing the wheat treated with urine on November 27 at the Beishangzhai Team Experiment Station, the nitrogen content of the wheat seedlings increased by 0.37 in just five days.

Human urine is an abundant source of fertilizer

After doing the above work, the Wheat High-Yield Group also investigated how large the source of human urine fertilizer is and how to apply it. According to past experience, the annual urine excretion of each adult is 1,400 jin. Used as topdressing, this urine can increase grain production by about 70 jin. Shangzhai Team also conducted a statistical analysis, and the team's human waste accounts for 30% of the total fertilizer volume.

The amount of urine used on wheat by this team is generally four to five dan to seven to eight dan of urine and manure mixture per mu. Before application, about twice the amount of water is added to the human manure and urine.

This investigation and research has always been carried out under the leadership of the Party branch and relying on the masses. Through investigation and research, the team, based on the principle of overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement, made a reasonable allocation of urine for the team and the members, and selected three to five people who are fair, selfless, hardworking, and able to endure hardship to form a professional group for collecting and spreading urine. This makes the accumulation and application of urine fertilizer during the wheat field topdressing period regular and institutionalized, so that a new atmosphere of building water toilets and setting up urine jars for collecting urine fertilizer has quickly emerged in the entire team.

    追施尿肥促使回茬麦盘根分蘖
    本报记者
    尿泼回茬麦，长苗如手拔
    用人尿泼麦的作用到底有多大？中国农业科学院西北土壤生物研究所小麦丰产组在临潼雨金公社尚寨生产队作了调查。大量的调查对比材料进一步证实：人尿确是一种质量高，见效快的好肥料，用人尿泼麦，是促进回茬麦盘根分蘖的关键性的措施。社员们从活生生的事实中，认识和肯定了人尿泼麦的好处。有人编快板形容说：“尿泼回茬麦，长苗如手拔，扎根像箭发，该打一石打石八。”通过调查研究，把这里的尿泼回茬麦运动推向新高潮。11月28日前全队每天尿泼麦十亩多，28日以后猛升到三十多亩，到12月8日，全队一千二百亩生长较差的回茬麦，用尿泼过的达六百三十二亩。
    尚寨生产队用人尿泼麦是从1957年开始的。三年来，在同样土质，同样作务的条件下，凡是用人尿泼过的回茬麦比没有泼过的回茬麦，平均亩产高出七十斤左右。
    今年入冬后，这个队继续运用这一成功的经验，开展了尿泼麦运动。中国科学院西北土壤生物研究所小麦丰产组（以下简称小麦丰产组）也在尚寨生产队的北尚寨、南尚寨、灰和村等七个自然村和生产队试验站的八个点、二十三块麦田，进行了仔细调查。调查结果，明显地看出：尿泼麦对促进回茬小麦的分蘖、盘根起了很大作用。
    尿泼的麦平均每株分蘖两个，单株次生根一点七个。没有尿泼的，平均每株分蘖只一点二个，少零点八个。单株次生根只零点六个，少一点一个。根据小麦冬前分蘖多少与来年有效分蘖多少有极密切关系的经验判断，用尿泼过的小麦，就为回茬赶正茬、超正茬；三类赶一类、超一类，打下良好的基础。
    泼了比不泼好，早泼比晚泼好
    早泼好还是晚泼好；光泼早播的回茬麦好还是先泼晚播的回茬麦好？据小麦丰产组在这个队试验站的麦田里调查，早泼比晚泼好。11月12日用尿泼过的麦，平均分蘖
  （包括主茎）二点六七个，单株次生根三点五个，单株叶片数八点五个，株高二十一点厘米。11月18日用尿泼的麦平均分蘖和12日的相同，但单株次生根只二点四个，单株叶片数只六点五个，株高十八点八厘米。11月27日尿泼的，平均分蘖（包括主茎）只一点八三个，单株次生根只一点四个，单株叶片数只五点六个，株高十八点三厘米。无论早播的回茬麦或晚播的回茬麦，用尿泼过的效果都很好，特别是早泼的效果更好。根据对四块麦田的调查，10月7日早播的，用尿泼过的小麦，平均每株分蘖二点一个，比没有用尿泼过的小麦每株分蘖多点九个，尿泼过的单株次生根二点二个，比没有用尿泼过的单株次生根多一个。10月23日晚播的，用尿泼过的小麦平均每株分蘖一点四九个，没有用尿泼的只一点零二个，尿泼过的单株次生根一点二个，没用尿泼的只零点三个。
    尿肥的肥效为什么这样大
    用尿泼麦为什么能产生这样明显的作用？经过小麦丰产组和北尚寨队土专家的仔细分析，认为：一、人尿是一种完全肥料，据化验，人尿中通常含氮0.5％，含磷酸0.13％，含氧化钾0.1％。这样，一千斤人尿可相当于二十五到三十斤硫铵的肥效。二、人尿是一种速效肥料，很容易被植物吸收利用。三、人尿含有对植物有利的生长刺激素，能促进小麦生长发育。为了证实这些论断正确，小麦丰产组和北尚寨的土洋专家又再一次深入到田里取样分析。早泼的小麦中含氮量比晚泼的含氮量高三分之一以上。晚泼的也有明显的效果。北尚寨队试验站11月27日尿泼的小麦采样分析时，只五天时间，麦苗含氮量就增加零点三七。
    人尿是一项丰富的肥源
    小麦丰产组在做了上述工作以后，又对人尿肥源到底有多大，以及怎样施用等作了调查。根据以往经验，每个成年人每人每年尿的排泄量是一千四百斤，用做追肥，这些尿可以增产粮食七十斤左右。尚寨队还做了一次统计，全队人粪尿要占到全部肥料量中的30％。
    这个队用尿泼麦的数量，一般是一亩地泼四、五担到七、八担尿液和粪尿混合液。施用前，在人粪尿里加一倍左右的水。
    这次的调查研究，始终是在党支部领导下，依靠群众进行的。通过调查研究，这个队本着统筹兼顾，全面安排的方针，对队和社员用尿作了合理分配，选派了为人公正、吃苦耐劳的三至五人成立了收尿泼尿专业组。使积尿泼尿在麦田追肥期间，形成经常化、制度化，使全队很快出现了一个家家修水厕，设尿缸，大积尿肥的新风气。
