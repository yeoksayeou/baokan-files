Universal Education Closely Combined with Individual Assistance, Explaining Principles Clearly and Solving Practical Difficulties
The Lushui Party Branch Does Detailed Ideological Work

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Lushui Brigade Party Branch of the Shahe Commune in Bobai County, Guangxi, has conducted ideological work among the masses through various methods, highly promoting the enthusiasm of the masses in building socialism. As a result, production has improved, the backwardness has been changed, and the total rice output has increased year after year.

    The main aspects of this branch's experience in doing political and ideological work are as follows:

    1. Combining policy propaganda with policy implementation. The Party branch of this brigade has always attached importance to propaganda work. The branch frequently propagates the Party's policies to the masses repeatedly. In the propaganda, it not only explains how the policies stipulate, but also explains why they are stipulated in this way, so that the masses can understand the essence of the policies. When carrying out each major task, it always first conducts full ideological mobilization within the Party, so that each Party member thoroughly understands the purpose and significance of the work, and then relies on them to carry out propaganda and education for the masses. Party members are assigned to be responsible for both production and life, as well as ideological mobilization, carrying out ideological work to each household and individual, so that the masses consciously complete all tasks of the Party. They not only propagate policies, but more importantly, they combine policy propaganda with policy implementation, propagandizing while fulfilling promises. When propagating the Party's various policies concerning people's communes and rural work, the branch adjusted the three-guarantee output based on the policies and the actual production situation of the brigade. Six teams achieved exceeding their contracted output for the early rice crop, and rewards were given where due, and penalties were applied where necessary. After the implementation of the three guarantees for the late rice crop, a movement to exceed contracted output was immediately launched, laying the foundation for a bumper harvest of late rice.

    2. Paying attention to both universal education and "using a different key to open each lock". On the basis of universal education, the branch delves into the educational work of individual people, using the method of using a different key to open each lock to solve everyone's ideological problems, so that everyone can actively participate in the movement. For example, Pang Shibao, a member of the Sixth Team, sometimes did not go to work without reason. The team cadres repeatedly talked to him individually, conducted education, and inspired him to recall and compare, finally making him realize his mistakes and actively go to work. He was rated as a five-good member. In the autumn harvest distribution last year, the three members of his family received 116 yuan in wages in addition to food rations.

    3. Combining future education with recall and comparison education. They often use various methods to explain the future prospects of socialism and communism to the members, so that the members understand the direction of advancement and see the bright future of the country and themselves. At the same time, they also educate the members to recall the past and compare it with the present, inspiring everyone to work hard to realize their happy and grand ideals. When the members recalled that before liberation, there were more than 2,800 mu of land in their village, except for more than 300 mu of paddies along the river that could be planted with rice, the rest of the dry land could only be planted with hillside rice, sweet potatoes, and other miscellaneous grains; seeing that after liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the face of the village changed year by year, the area of paddy fields increased from more than 300 mu to 1,800 mu, and the yield per mu increased from more than 100 jin to more than 800 jin, they realized that only under the leadership of the Communist Party, with concerted efforts, hard work, and determination to become strong, can they gradually move towards a prosperous road. Therefore, they responded more actively and consciously to the call of the Party. For example, when the branch called on everyone to be diligent and thrifty, every household saved grain.

    4. Combining reasoning with presenting facts. When this branch encountered doubts from members in promoting new technical measures, they reasoned on the one hand and conducted experiments and comparisons on the other hand, using facts to educate the members. For example, last year, when late rice was to promote the white-husk dwarf variety, some members did not believe it, always saying that the original "seven-day soaking" was better. At this time, Party member and team leader Pang Shide and the members conducted variety experiments and specification comparison test fields. As a result, the white-husk dwarf yielded 313 jin more per mu than the "seven-day soaking", and the 5×3 specification yielded 181 jin more per mu than the 6×4 specification. The members were very surprised and ran to visit and study, counting seedlings and counting grains, and they were all convinced. Therefore, this year, the entire brigade promoted the white-husk dwarf variety on more than 1,500 mu of late rice, accounting for more than 86% of the rice area.

    5. Combining ideological education with solving practical problems. While conducting ideological education, this branch also earnestly and promptly solves the practical problems of the members. Before the autumn of 1959, when public canteens were not well-run, every family had to leave someone at home to cook and chop firewood, and they also needed to earn some money for oil and salt, so the attendance rate of members was only about 60% of the labor force. However, since the autumn harvest, after the brigade conscientiously ran the canteens well, the members all ate in the canteens, and the number of workers often reached more than 90% of the labor force.

### 普遍教育紧密结合个别帮助　既讲清道理又解决实际困难  绿湖党支部思想工作做得细致

    普遍教育紧密结合个别帮助　既讲清道理又解决实际困难
    绿湖党支部思想工作做得细致
    本报讯　广西博白县沙河公社绿湖大队党支部，通过各种方式向群众进行思想工作，高度发扬了群众建设社会主义的积极性，因而搞好了生产，改变了落后面貌，水稻总产量连年增加。
    这个支部做政治思想工作的经验，主要有以下几个方面：
    一、宣传政策与执行政策相结合。这个大队的党支部，一贯重视宣传工作。支部经常把党的方针政策，向群众反复宣传。在宣传中，不但讲明方针政策如何规定，而且讲清为什么要这样规定，使群众领会到方针、政策的精神实质。在进行每一项重大工作时，总是首先在党内进行充分的思想动员，使每个党员透彻地了解工作的目的意义，然后依靠他们，开展对群众的宣传教育。党员分工包干，既包生产、生活，又包思想发动，把思想工作做到户，做到人，使群众自觉地完成党的一切任务。他们不光是宣传政策，更主要的是把宣传政策与执行政策结合起来，边宣传，边兑现。在宣传党的有关人民公社与农村工作的各项政策时，支部根据政策和本大队生产的实际情况，调整了三包产量，有六个队获得早造超包产，做到应奖的照奖，应罚的照罚。晚造三包落实后，立即掀起了超包产运动，打下了晚造丰收的基础。
    二、既注意普遍教育，也注意“一把钥匙开一把锁”。支部在普遍教育的基础上，深入做好个别人的教育工作，用一把钥匙开一把锁的办法，解决每个人的思想问题，使大家都能够积极地投入运动。如第六队有个社员庞世保，有时无故不出工，队干部反复找他个别谈话，进行教育，又启发他回忆对比，终于使他认识了错误，积极出工，被评为五好社员。去年秋收分配，父子三人除口粮外，得工资一百一十六元。
    三、前途教育与回忆对比教育相结合。他们经常运用各种方式，向社员讲解社会主义、共产主义的前途远景，使社员明确前进的方向，看到国家和自己的美好前途。同时又教育社员回忆过去，对比现在，激发大家为实现幸福、远大的理想而艰苦奋斗。当社员们回想到本村解放前二千八百多亩土地，除江岸有三百多亩戽水田可种水稻外，其余大片旱地只能种些坡禾、红薯和其他杂粮的时候；看到解放后在党的领导下，一年年改变了面貌，水田面积从以前三百多亩增加到一千八百亩，每亩产量从以前百把斤提高到八百多斤的时候，他们就意识到只有在共产党的领导下，同心同德，艰苦奋斗，发愤图强，才能步步走向富裕的道路。因而更加积极、自觉地响应党的号召。例如支部号召大家勤俭节约，家家户户就节约了粮食。
    四、讲道理与摆事实相结合。这个支部在推广新的技术措施，碰到社员有怀疑的时候，他们就一面讲道理，一方面进行试验对比，用事实来教育社员。比如去年晚造要推广白壳矮良种，有些社员不信，总说还是原来的“七日浸”好。这时，党员队长庞世德就和社员搞了品种试验和规格对比试验田，结果白壳矮比“七日浸”亩产多三百一十三斤，5×3规格比6×4规格亩产多一百八十一斤。社员感到很惊奇，都跑去参观研究，数苗数，数谷粒，都信服了。因此，今年晚造全大队共推广了白壳矮良种一千五百多亩，占水稻面积86％以上。
    五、思想教育与解决实际问题相结合。这个支部在进行思想教育的同时，还认真地、及时地去解决社员的实际问题。1959年秋季以前，那时没有办好公共食堂，每家都要留人在家煮饭、打柴，平时也要搞些油盐钱，社员出勤率仅达劳动力的60％左右。但从秋收起，大队认真把食堂办好了以后，社员都在食堂吃饭，出工人数就经常达到劳动力的90％以上。（附图片）
