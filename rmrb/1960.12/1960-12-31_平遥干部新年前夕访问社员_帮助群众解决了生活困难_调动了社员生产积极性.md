    Pingyao Cadres Visit Commune Members Before the New Year
    Help the Masses Solve Living Difficulties, and Arouse the Production Enthusiasm of Commune Members

    (Our report) As the New Year approaches, leading cadres at all levels in Pingyao County, Shanxi Province, are carrying forward the fine traditions of the land reform work teams, visiting the masses from door to door, discovering problems, and solving them on the spot.

    In the past half month, more than 1,700 cadres in the county have visited more than 20,000 commune members' households, solved various difficulties for 6,278 commune member households, and distributed 490 pieces of winter clothing and more than 55,000 yuan in relief funds. When County Party Secretary Zheng Luqing and other comrades visited the Daobei Management Area of Hongshan Commune, they discovered that the masses urgently needed to solve the coal problem, so they immediately adopted the method of the management area advancing funds for purchase and distributing by household, and bought back coal to ensure that the masses could keep warm in winter.

    Through this visit to show concern and warmth, the political enthusiasm and production activism of the broad masses have been further mobilized, and the relationship between the Party and the masses has been strengthened. When Ma Shiji, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, Hu Liangqi, the Secretary of the Secretariat, and other comrades delivered coal to the homes of households in difficulty early in the morning, the masses said with gratitude, "Only Chairman Mao's cadres can serve the masses like this!" At present, the enthusiasm of the masses for winter production is increasing day by day. Most of the more than 300 laborers in the Ninggu Management Area are engaged in the manure accumulation campaign, and have now accumulated more than 12,000 loads of fertilizer, laying a good foundation for a bumper harvest next year.

    Recently, the Pingyao County Party Committee checked and summarized this work. It decided to fix the door-to-door visiting work and form a system.

    平遥干部新年前夕访问社员
    帮助群众解决了生活困难　调动了社员生产积极性
    本报讯　新年将到。山西省平遥县各级领导干部，发扬当年土改工作队的优良作风，挨门逐户访问群众，发现问题，就地解决。
    最近半个月来，全县一千七百余名干部，已经访问了二万余户社员，解决了六千二百七十八户社员的各种困难问题，并发放了寒衣四百九十件，救济款五万五千余元。县委书记郑履青等同志，在洪善公社道备管理区访问时，发现群众迫切需要解决煤炭问题，就立即采取了管理区垫资购买、分户结算的办法，买回来煤炭，保证了群众过冬取暖。
    通过这次访寒问暖，进一步调动了广大群众的政治热情和生产积极性，密切了党群关系。当县委第一书记马石纪、书记处书记胡良奇等同志，在大清早给困难户上门送炭时，群众感激地说：“只有毛主席的干部，才能这样为群众服务！”目前，群众冬季生产的积极性日益高涨。宁固管理区三百多个劳动力，绝大部分投入积肥运动，现已积肥一万二千余担，为明年大丰收打下了良好基础。
    最近，中共平遥县委检查总结了这一工作。决定把挨门访问的工作固定下来，形成制度。
