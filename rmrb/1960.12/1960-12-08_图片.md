    Tangjiabo Commune, Qixia County, Shandong Province, suffered severe natural disasters this year. However, under the leadership of the Party and relying on the superiority of the People's Commune, the commune members actively carried out disaster relief struggles. As a result of the autumn harvest, the unit area yield of grain crops decreased by only about 20% compared to last year.
