    "Treasure pot of the team, everyone cares, never returning empty-handed, value surpassing gold." This is a poem written on a wooden sign in front of our team's treasure pot. The waste and discarded materials recovered by the workers of our team are all collected here.

    This is a small garden that I opened up for everyone after being elected as the team's material administrator. It is located in the open space in front of the rest room. Every day, when everyone returns from the construction site, they conveniently pile the waste and discarded materials picked up from the construction site here. Among them are waste lead wires, broken rebar ends, half-used welding rods, etc. Over time, we have recovered a lot! The amount on the "Value Table of Recovered Materials" posted in front of the treasure pot by the cost accountant keeps increasing. From the beginning of the year to now, our team has recovered and saved materials worth more than 178,000 yuan.

    When the treasure pot was first set up, we could sometimes pick up half sheets of iron sheet and small pieces of bar iron; later, everyone paid more attention to saving materials, and all the teams in the entire work area successively set up treasure pots, so it was difficult for us to pick up anything in whole pieces or strips. However, the most important things in the world are "persistence" and "seriousness." When everyone is walking, they often pay attention to whether there are any scattered waste materials on the roadside; after work, they inspect the site again; when transferring to new projects and working with comrades from other work areas, we take the lead in recycling. Because the recycling of waste materials has become a habit for the team members, we can still recover a lot of things. No wonder some comrades often jokingly say to me: "You, the material administrator, are really a 'treasure collector', your team should also be renamed 'Treasure Collecting Team'!"

### “聚宝员”和“聚宝队”

    “聚宝员”和“聚宝队”
    “小队聚宝盆，大家都关心，来回不空手，价值赛黄金。”这是一首写在我们小队聚宝盆前一块木牌上的诗。我们小队工人同志回收的废旧材料都集中在这里。
    这是我当选为小队材料管理员以后为大伙开辟的一个小园地。它就在休息室前面的空地上。每天，大伙从工地回来，顺手就把从工地上拣的废旧材料堆放在这里。其中有废铅丝、碎钢筋头、半截电焊条，等等。日积月累，我们回收的东西可就多啦！核算员张贴在聚宝盆前的“回收材料价值表”上，金额不断增加。从年初到现在，我们小队回收节约的材料价值十七万八千多元。
    刚设聚宝盆的时候，我们有时还能拣到小半张的铁皮、小块元铁；后来，大家都更加注意节约使用材料，全工区各个小队都陆续设立了聚宝盆，我们就很难拣到什么成块成条的东西了。但是，天下的事贵在“坚持”和“认真”这几个字。大伙在走路的时候，经常留心路边有没有零碎的废旧材料；下班以后，都在现场巡视一遍；转移到新工程上，和别的工区的同志搭伙干活，我们又带头搞回收。由于回收废旧材料已经成了队员们的习惯，我们还是可以回收到不少东西。难怪有些同志见了我常常开玩笑地说：“你这个材料员真是一个‘聚宝员’，你们小队也该改名叫‘聚宝队’啦！”
