Under the Socialist System, Rapidly Changing the Backward Situation
The Slovak Region Has Developed Industry and Agriculture

(Reported by this newspaper) The Czechoslovak Republic is composed of two main ethnic groups, Czech and Slovak. Before liberation, due to the national discrimination policy implemented by the bourgeoisie and landlord regime, the economy of the Slovak region was far more backward than that of the Czech region. After liberation, the Czechoslovak Party and government implemented a policy of national equality and paid special attention to accelerating the economic development of the Slovak region.

In the fifteen years of building socialism in Czechoslovakia, Slovakia has made great achievements in economic, social, and cultural development. The backwardness of the Slovak region has been completely eliminated, and it has become a developed industrial and agricultural area.

In the past fifteen years, 218 new factories equipped with modern technology have been built in the Slovak region. In addition, as many factories have been fundamentally rebuilt and expanded. Industrial production in 1960 will exceed the production volume in 1937 by about nine times. The number of industrial employees reached 400,000, while before the war, the number of employees in this area was only slightly more than 100,000.

Due to the leading role of industry, the entire economic outlook of Slovakia has changed. The scattered and backward small agricultural production has been transformed into a large-scale socialist mechanized production sector. Currently, 80% of the agricultural area belongs to cooperatives and state farms. In 1930, the agricultural sector only had over a thousand tractors, but now it has over 22,000 tractors and thousands of other large agricultural machines. With the number of employees in agriculture reduced by half, agricultural production efficiency has increased by about 50%.

Accompanying the rapid and comprehensive economic development of Slovakia is the development of Slovak national culture in socialist Czechoslovakia. Sufficient to illustrate the development of cultural undertakings is the rapid development of education, the establishment of theaters and cinemas, amateur art activities, science, creative and plastic arts, etc. However, the most telling fact about the improvement of residents' cultural level is that fifteen years ago, the number of experts in the Slovak region was simply very small, while now there are 157.7 experts for every 1,000 employees. In the past six years, the number of experts in the Slovak region has more than doubled. In 1937, there was one college student for every 400 families, while now there is one college student for every 42 families.

The rapid economic and cultural development of the Slovak region, especially socialist industrialization, was made possible by the selfless assistance of the developed Czech region. The huge investment in the Slovak region was achieved by relying on the accumulation of the national economy of the entire country. This backward region has developed with the material and spiritual assistance of the entire republic. This demonstrates in practice the new socialist relationship between the Czech and Slovak nations.

The Czechoslovak 1961-1965 Third Five-Year Plan stipulates that all sectors of the Slovak national economy should develop rapidly, especially the industrial sector. Due to Slovakia's geographical location, and considering that Slovakia is adjacent to the Soviet Union—Czechoslovakia will import a large amount of iron ore and oil from the Soviet Union—the metallurgical industry and chemical industry will be developed in the Slovak region. After the completion of the East Slovak Iron and Steel Company project, it will become one of the largest and most modern iron and steel complexes in Europe. (Attached picture)

    在社会主义制度下迅速改变落后面貌
    斯洛伐克地区有了发达的工农业
    本报讯　捷克斯洛伐克共和国是由捷克和斯洛伐克两个主要民族组成的，在解放前，由于资产阶级和地主政权执行的民族歧视政策，斯洛伐克地区的经济远比捷克地区落后。解放后，捷克斯洛伐克党和政府执行民族平等政策，特别重视加速斯洛伐克地区的经济发展。
    在捷克斯洛伐克建设社会主义的十五年中，斯洛伐克在经济、社会和文化的发展方面取得了巨大的成就。斯洛伐克地区的落后现象完全消除了，它变成了一个发达的工农业地区。
    在过去的十五年中，斯洛伐克地区建起了二百一十八座用现代技术装备的新工厂。此外，还有这么多数目的工厂从根本上进行了改建和扩建。1960年的工业生产将超过1937年生产量约九倍。工业职工人数达四十万，而在战前这方面的职工人数只稍多于十万人。
    由于工业的主导作用，斯洛伐克整个的经济面貌都改变了。分散、落后的小农业生产变成了社会主义的大机器生产部门。现在，80％的农业面积属于合作社和国营农场。在1930年，农业部门只拥有一千多台拖拉机，而现在已拥有二万二千多台拖拉机和数千台其它的大型农业机器。在从事农业的职工人数减少一半的情形下，农业生产效率却提高了约50％。
    伴随着斯洛伐克经济迅速和全面发展的是，斯洛伐克的民族文化在社会主义捷克斯洛伐克的发展。足以说明文化事业发展的是，教育事业的迅速发展，剧院和电影院的建立、业余艺术活动、科学、创作和造型艺术事业的发展等。然而，最能说明居民文化水平提高的事实是，十五年前，斯洛伐克地区的专家人数简直少得很，而现在在每一千职工中就有一百五十七点七名专家。在过去的六年中，斯洛伐克地区专家的人数增长了一倍多。在1937年，每四百个家庭有一名大学生，而现在每四十二个家庭就有一名大学生。
    斯洛伐克地区经济和文化的迅速发展，特别是社会主义工业化之所以可能，是由于发达的捷克地区的无私援助。斯洛伐克地区的巨大投资是依靠整个国家国民经济的积累来实现的，这个落后地区是在整个共和国的物质和精神的援助下获得发展的。这样，在实际上表现了捷克和斯洛伐克民族之间新的社会主义的关系。
    捷克斯洛伐克的1961—1965年的第三个五年计划规定，斯洛伐克国民经济的各个部门都要迅速发展，特别是工业部门。由于斯洛伐克的地理位置，同时考虑到斯洛伐克与苏联相邻——捷克斯洛伐克将从苏联输入大量的铁矿石和石油——，因而在斯洛伐克地区将发展冶金工业和化学工业。斯洛伐克东部钢铁公司工程竣工后，将成为欧洲规模最大，最现代化的钢铁联合企业之一。（附图片）
