This newspaper reports from Xi'an on December 4th: The Xingping County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently invited a group of experts, technicians, and experienced farmers to meet in the fields to identify the growth characteristics of this year's winter wheat and discuss winter management measures.

Xingping County has planted 1.2 million mu of wheat, an increase of 70,000 mu compared to last year, and the sowing quality is generally good. In order to further guide the masses in doing a good job in wheat field management, the Xingping County Committee invited more than 30 professors, technicians from the Northwest Agricultural College, the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the Institute of Biology and Soil, and the Irrigation Experiment Station, as well as experienced farmers from various communes in early November to conduct in-depth investigations of wheat seedling growth in the representative Yincun Production Team of the Chengguan Commune, and discuss specific management measures. They roughly divided wheat growth into three types: First, the properly rotated wheat, with good land preparation, sufficient base fertilizer, and timely sowing, has a solid root system and has begun to tiller; second, the wheat in replanted fields, due to the urgency of planting time, and the land was poorly harrowed, the wheat roots are not firmly established, and tillering is slow; third, some late autumn fields, due to rushing to plant, the land was not deeply ploughed, and less fertilizer was applied; some were even sown with hoes before the autumn crops were harvested, the seeds were sown shallowly, with many floating seeds, and the wheat seedlings were weak. Another common phenomenon of the latter two types of wheat seedlings is that there was a lot of rain during the sowing period, the ground became hardened and cracked, and the wheat roots were easily exposed to wind and frost.

After analyzing these current growth characteristics of wheat, everyone believed that the focus of winter wheat management this year should be: focusing on fertilization, prioritizing the management of replanted wheat; adapting measures to local conditions, and adhering to winter irrigation; promoting and protecting simultaneously (promoting early rooting, more tillering, and strong seedlings, and preserving moisture, warmth, and seedlings), and striving for balanced yield increase.

In view of the actual situation of replanted wheat sowing, everyone suggested that various wheat crops should adopt the following measures: 1. Apply livestock manure quickly if no base fertilizer has been applied. 2. For those sown on hard stubble or sown with hoes, immediately spray urea and superphosphate, and other quick-acting fertilizers externally on the roots. 3. After the wheat has tillered, before the ground freezes, quickly hoe, harrow and roll to ensure the healthy growth of basic seedlings. 4. Saturate the fields with freezing water before the ground freezes.

Now, Xingping County is actively promoting these field management measures, striving to make strong seedlings stronger, upgrade weak seedlings, and enable all wheat fields to overwinter vigorously.

This newspaper reports from Zhengzhou: The Party Branch of the Mengpai Brigade of the Pohu People's Commune in Changge County, Henan, patiently listened to the opinions of cadres and members of various production teams, used the working method of the mass line, based on the results of experimental research, and used the Party's policies as weapons to deeply mobilize the masses to implement the "six-character" measures for winter wheat field management—supplementing, topdressing, watering, rolling, ploughing, and treating—to ensure that wheat increases roots, increases heads, and has strong seedlings, and survives the winter well.

As early as the beginning of November, the Party Branch of the Mengpai Brigade synthesized the opinions of various production teams and proposed the "six-character" measures for wheat management before winter. In practice, the members raised the following two questions about the Party Branch's requirements of "early wheat tillering well, late wheat rooting first": How much tillering per mu is good for the more than 800 mu of early-sown wheat planted before the "Cold Dew" solar term? Is there any way to make the more than 500 mu of late-sown wheat planted around the "Beginning of Winter" solar term tiller early? Everyone raised many opinions around these two questions. The Party Branch repeatedly studied the opinions from all sides, revised the original imperfect plan, and re-proposed the requirements of "early wheat having enough heads (750,000 to 800,000 per mu), and late wheat developing heads early," and handed it over to the production teams for discussion.

In the discussion of the production team members, everyone advocated for applying human manure and urine as early as possible for the problem of late wheat developing heads early. However, there were different opinions on the issue of watering. Some said that for late wheat, it is better to apply fertilizer early and water with the fertilizer; others said that now the late wheat is still single-rooted seedlings, and if water enters the field, the soil will be compacted and the wheat seedlings will be frozen to death. In order to come to a correct conclusion, the brigade party branch looked for peasant experts and agricultural scientific and technical personnel who were helping work here to study, and they decided to immediately conduct six different comparative tests on three different types of wheat seedlings (one in the three-leaf stage, one after needle inversion and starting to develop heads, and one just needle inverted) to test the adaptability of the "six-character" measures to late-sown wheat. Among them, focusing on the issue that everyone was arguing about, the emphasis was placed on the comparative test of topdressing and watering versus topdressing without watering. On the fifth day, soil experts, experienced farmers, and technicians went to the wheat fields for careful inspection and analyzed a set of the three groups of experiments (the second group). After analysis, the conclusions were: First, the wheat seedlings with added water and fertilizer had longer and wider three leaves, the above-ground part was heavier, and the stems were thicker than those with only added fertilizer and no added water. This shows that the wheat seedlings have become stronger. Second, the wheat seedlings with added water and fertilizer had better root system development, and the roots were longer and deeper than those with only added fertilizer and no added water. This shows that adding water and fertilizer can significantly promote wheat seedling rooting and strive for late wheat to tiller early. Everyone said: This experiment has increased our knowledge, let's go back and water the wheat quickly! Each production team organized manpower to repair field projects, repair water conservancy machinery, and began watering the late wheat. At present, the entire brigade has applied fertilizer and watered 220 mu at the same time.

The brigade party branch, according to the members' opinion that "the six-character measures are all very good, especially the fertilizer character is the most important," specifically checked and calculated the task of accumulating and topdressing fertilizer before winter. The results of the check and calculation showed that everyone thought that it was getting colder earlier this year than in previous years, and the wheat field topdressing was urgent, but the existing manure was still insufficient. What should be done? The Party Branch took the following three measures: First, it strengthened the leadership of collective manure accumulation. On the one hand, it organized each production team to build public toilets in the village in a planned way and assigned special personnel to clean them. On the other hand, it built large manure ponds in the fields in a planned way and carried out large-scale accumulation and fermentation. Second, appropriately increase the price of fertilizer and collect a large amount of fertilizer from the members' homes. Third, cadres took the lead in picking up manure and accumulating fertilizer. Party member cadres did: have manure picking tools, and pick up a certain number of kilograms of manure every day. Ma Tongyi, the secretary of the Party Branch, took the lead in setting a plan to pick up 15 carts of manure before winter. Other party members and cadres also set out plans to pick up manure and accumulate fertilizer and took the lead in taking action. With the leadership taking the lead in doing this, the members followed suit. It has become a common practice for members to pick up manure during their spare time. Now, each production team has accumulated about 6,000 carts of crude fertilizer, and 1,300 mu of wheat fields have been topdressed with human manure and urine.

In addition to conscientiously implementing the holiday system, this brigade has also further promoted quota management in order to ensure that the members work well and rest well.

Through the above measures, the leadership in wheat field management has been strengthened, which has powerfully promoted the current wheat field management movement.

    深入调查具体安排麦田管理
    兴平县以肥为主先管回茬麦，因苗制宜早浇封冻水
    长葛县孟排大队经过对比试验，找出科学管理方法
    本报西安4日电　中共陕西省兴平县委最近邀请了一批专家、技术人员和老农，会师田间，找寻今年小麦冬前生长特点，商订冬季管理措施。
    兴平县共种小麦一百二十万亩，比去年增加了七万亩，播种质量一般都好。兴平县委为了进一步领导群众做好小麦田间管理工作，11月上旬邀请了西北农学院、中国农业科学院陕西分院、生物土壤研究所、灌溉试验站的教授、技术人员和各公社的老农共三十多人，深入到有地区代表性的城关公社尹村生产队，就地查看麦苗生长情况，商讨具体管理措施。他们把小麦生势大体分三种类型：一类是整地好、底肥足、播种适时的正茬麦，根系入土扎实，已经开始分蘖；二类是回茬地的小麦，因下种时间紧迫，土地打耱较差，麦根扎得不实在，分蘖缓慢；三类是部分晚秋田，由于抢时下种，土地没有深翻，施肥较少；有的还是在秋禾未收前用锄撒种的，种得浅，浮籽多，麦苗孱弱。后二类麦苗的另一个共同现象是：播种期间雨水多，地面板结发生裂缝，麦根容易吃风受冻。
    在分析了当前小麦的这些生长特点以后，大家认为，今年小麦冬季管理的重点应该是：以肥为主，优先管回茬麦；因苗制宜，坚持冬灌；促保并重（促早盘根、多分蘖、幼苗健壮和保墒、保温、保苗），力争平衡增产。
    大家针对当前回茬麦播种的实际状况，建议各种麦采取如下措施：一、没有施底肥的，快施牲口粪肥。二、对硬茬下种或用锄撒种的，马上根外喷尿和过磷酸钙等速效肥。三、在麦子分蘖后，封冻前，抓紧锄耱镇压，以保证基本苗生长健壮。四、封冻前饱灌一次封冻水。
    现在，兴平县正在积极推广这些田间管理措施，力争壮苗更壮，弱苗升级，全部麦田茁壮越冬。
    本报讯　河南长葛县坡胡人民公社孟排大队党支部耐心听取各个生产队干部和社员的意见，运用群众路线的工作方法，以试验研究的结果为依据，以党的政策为武器，深入发动群众执行冬前麦田管理“六字”措施——补、追、浇、压、耕、治，保证小麦增根、增头、壮苗，过好越冬关。
    早在11月上旬，孟排大队党支部就综合了各个生产队的意见，提出了小麦冬前管理“六字”措施。在实践当中，社员们对党支部提的“早麦分好蘖，晚麦先盘根”的要求，提出了这样两个问题：“寒露”前种的八百多亩早茬麦，每亩冬前分蘖到底以多少为好？“立冬”前后种的五百多亩晚茬麦，到底有没有办法使它早分蘖？大家围绕这两个问题提了很多意见。党支部反复研究了各方面的意见，修改了原订的不尽完善的计划，重新提出“早麦发够头（每亩七十五万到八十万个），晚麦早发头”的要求，交各生产队讨论。
    各生产队社员在讨论中，对晚麦早发头问题，大家都主张尽量早追人粪尿。可是在浇水问题上，却有不同的看法。有的说，对于晚麦，还是早追肥，随追肥随浇水为好；有人却说，现在晚麦还是单根独苗，水一进地，踏实了土壤，会冻死麦苗。为了得出一个正确的结论，大队党支部就找农民专家和在这里帮助工作的农业科学技术人员研究，他们决定对三种不同的麦苗（一是进入三叶期的，二是倒针后开始发头的，三是刚倒针的）立即分别作出六种不同的对比试验，来检验“六字”措施对于晚茬麦的适应程度。其中，针对大家争论的问题，重点放在追肥又浇水与只追肥不浇水的对比试验上。第五天，土专家、老农和技术人员到麦田进行了细致检查，分析了三组试验中的一组（第二组）。经过分析，结论是：第一、加水加肥的比只加肥不加水的麦苗三叶长而宽，地上部分较重，秆较粗。这说明麦苗变壮了。第二、加水加肥的比只加肥未加水的，麦苗根系发育好，根长根深。这就说明加水又加肥能显著促进麦苗盘根，争取晚麦早分蘖。大家说：这一试验，给咱们长了见识，赶快回去浇麦吧！各生产队都纷纷组织人力整修田间工程，检修水利机具，浇起晚茬麦来。目前，全大队在追肥的同时已浇了二百二十亩。
    大队党支部根据社员们说的“六字措施都很好，尤以肥字最重要”的意见，具体查算了冬前积肥追肥任务。查算的结果，都认为今年比往年冷的早，麦田追肥迫不及待，而现有粪肥还很不足。如何办呢？党支部采取了以下三项措施：首先加强了对集体积肥的领导，一方面组织各生产队在村内有计划地建设公共厕所，固定专人打扫，一方面在田间有计划地修建大茅池，开展大积大沤。第二、适当提高肥料的价格，大量搜集社员家肥。第三、干部带头拾粪积肥，党员干部作到：有拾粪工具，每天拾粪有斤数。党支部书记马同义首先订出冬前拾粪十五车的计划。其它各个党员干部也都订出了拾粪积肥计划，带头行动起来。领导上带头这样做，社员们也就跟着干起来，社员利用工余时间拾粪，已成一种风气。现在，各个生产队积的粗肥达六千车左右，有一千三百亩麦田已追施了人粪尿。
    这个大队还根据既要使社员劳动好，又要使社员休息好的精神，除认真执行放假制度以外，还进一步普遍推行了定额管理。
    通过以上几项办法，加强了麦田管理工作中的领导，有力地推动了当前麦田管理运动。
