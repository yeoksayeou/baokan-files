Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing. The Huaian Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiangsu Province runs an on-site Party school at the Siyang Farm, using the advanced deeds of Zhang Xuetong, an outstanding Communist Party member and director of the Siyang Farm, as a living example to conduct political and ideological education for grassroots Party members and cadres.

The Siyang Farm is located on the former Yellow River滩, which was originally a barren land of rolling yellow sand. Because the director, Communist Party member Zhang Xuetong, had a high level of awareness, adhered to the Party's mass line, insisted on "four togethers" with the masses, and led all the farm workers in hard work, the farm's appearance has greatly changed after several years of effort by all the farm workers. Now this farm is a high-yielding grain and cotton unit and a red flag farm in the Huaian area with comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery. Since 1958, it has been able to hand over profits to the state every year. Zhang Xuetong has also become a model for rural grassroots cadres in the province.

In order to further implement the principle of combining theory with practice, the Party School of the Huaian Prefectural Committee moved to Siyang Farm in early May this year to run the school on-site, taking the advanced deeds of Siyang Farm and Zhang Xuetong as living examples to conduct ideological and political education for students. The teaching method is: first study (study Chairman Mao's works and the Party's policies); second look (visit the site); third listen (Zhang Xuetong and farm workers speak from their own experiences); fourth discuss (relate to reality, discuss and compare), and finally summarize.

The Party School has now run eight sessions and trained more than 4,100 Party members and grassroots cadres. They studied the advanced deeds of Zhang Xuetong and the farm staff who were loyal to the Party's cause, as well as their selfless devotion, selflessness, modesty, and prudence, and received a practical and vivid communist ideological education. Many students consciously checked themselves in connection with their own situations. Some students originally thought that the production of the units they led was very good and had a sense of complacency. After comparing themselves with the Siyang Farm in their studies, they realized that they were far behind and were determined to further improve their work.

Zhang Xuetong insisted on eating and living with the workers, insisted on participating in production, leading production, and fully trusting the masses, relying on the masses in everything, and adhering to the democratic style of persuasion and education, which deeply moved everyone. At the same time, they deeply realized that adhering to the "four togethers" is not only a matter of working methods, but a matter of the Party spirit of Communists. In their studies, everyone also saw that Zhang Xuetong, in leading production, implemented the Party's instructions that economic work should be done more and more carefully, and worked hard to study his business, turning himself from a layman into an expert. Therefore, after returning to their posts, they were able to pay attention to studying their business diligently. Ding Mingben, Deputy Secretary of the Luji Commune Party Committee in Suqian County, after learning about Zhang Xuetong's painstaking exploration of methods to prevent and control cotton bollworms, continuously observed in the rice fields for several days and nights, finally discovered the activity patterns of rice leaf rollers, and successfully researched methods to prevent and control rice leaf rollers. This method has been widely promoted.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou. The Party Branch of the Xingqiao Management District of the Haikou Commune in Fuqing County, Fujian Province, recently held a Party school to help Party members and cadres study a series of Party policies concerning the People's Commune, which has played a significant role in improving the policy understanding of Party members and cadres.

The Party School of the Xingqiao Management District uses spare time, holding classes once a week during busy farming seasons and once every three days during slack farming seasons, for two hours each time. The secretary of the Management District General Branch and the resident cadres of the Rural Work Department of the County Party Committee serve as teachers, closely combining with the current practical work to explain the central government's relevant instructions and policies on the People's Commune. In lecturing, the lecturer generally investigates the local situation first, so that local examples can be cited in the lecture, and the methods of recalling, comparing, and calculating are used to help Party members and cadres deepen their understanding of the policies, so that students can improve their work while studying.

After Chen Shizhou, the captain of the Xingqiao Production Brigade, studied the policy of "raising pigs should be done on two legs, with both public and private raising," he immediately made arrangements for the team's pig-raising production. In addition to continuing to do a good job in the pig-raising production of the brigade and team canteens, he also took the initiative to help commune members solve problems such as feed. After Lin Guangcui, the captain of the Xixing Brigade, understood the dialectical relationship between work and rest through study, he and the cadres and masses in the team jointly stipulated the basic workdays and arranged rotations for rest according to the specific conditions of each team, ensuring that male laborers rest for two days a month and female laborers rest for four days a month.

Since the Party School of the Management District was held for more than a month, the political atmosphere among the commune members and cadres has become more intense, and the number of people reading books, newspapers, and studying policies has greatly increased compared with the past. Party members and cadres are leading production more deeply. Lin Chunxiang, the instructor of the sixth team of the Xixing Brigade, used to have a relatively simple working method. After participating in the study, she realized her shortcomings. During the autumn harvest and winter planting, she insisted on "four togethers" with the masses, walked ahead in work, and consulted with the commune members to solve problems, which was praised by the masses. Now, the Party members and cadres in the entire district are actively leading the masses in digging river mud to prepare sufficient fertilizer for next year's spring plowing.

    新华社南京电　中共江苏省淮阴地委在泗阳农场办现场党校，以优秀共产党员、泗阳农场场长张学同的先进事迹作为活榜样，向基层党员和干部进行政治思想教育。
    泗阳县农场在废黄河滩上，原是黄沙滚滚的不毛之地。由于场长、共产党员张学同有高度的觉悟，坚持党的群众路线，坚持和群众“四同”，领导全场职工艰苦奋斗，经过全场职工的几年努力，使农场面貌大为改变。现在这个农场是粮棉高产单位和淮阴地区农林牧副渔全面发展的红旗农场，从1958年起每年都能向国家上缴利润。张学同也成为全省农村基层干部的标兵。
    中共淮阴地委党校为了进一步贯彻理论联系实际的方针，今年5月初就将党校迁到泗阳农场来现场办校，把泗阳农场和张学同的先进事迹作为活的榜样，对学员进行思想政治教育。教学方法是：一学（学习毛主席著作和党的方针政策）；二看（参观现场）；三听（张学同和场内职工现身说法）；四议（联系实际、讨论对照），最后进行总结。
    党校到现在已办了八期，共训练了四千一百多名党员和基层干部。他们学习了张学同和农场工作人员忠心耿耿地为党的事业奋斗的先进事迹，以及他们克己奉公、舍己为人、谦虚谨慎的作风，都受到一次实际、生动的共产主义思想教育。不少学员自觉地联系自己进行检查。有的学员原来认为自己领导的单位生产搞得很不错，有自满情绪。在学习中与泗阳农场对比后，才觉得相差还很远，都决心要进一步改进工作。
    张学同坚持与职工同吃、同住，坚持参加生产，领导生产，并且充分相信群众，事事依靠群众，和坚持说服教育的民主作风，使大家深为感动，同时深刻地体会到，坚持“四同”不仅是工作方法问题，而是共产党人的党性问题。大家在学习中，还看到张学同在领导生产时，执行了党提出的经济工作要越做越细的指示，刻苦钻研业务，使自己从外行变为内行。因此，回到岗位后，都能注意刻苦钻研业务。宿迁县陆集公社党委副书记丁明本学习了张学同刻苦探索防治棉花红铃虫的方法后，在稻田里连续观察几个白天和晚上，终于发现了稻包虫的活动规律，并研究成功了防治稻包虫的方法。这一方法已被广泛推行。
    新华社福州电　福建省福清县海口公社星桥管理区的党总支，最近举办党校帮助党员、干部学习党的有关人民公社的一系列政策，对提高党员和干部的政策水平起了显著作用。
    星桥管理区的党校利用业余时间，在农忙时每周上课一次，农闲时每三天一次，每次两小时。由管理区总支书记和县委农村工作部的驻点干部担任教员，紧密结合当前的实际工作，讲解中央关于人民公社的有关指示、政策。在讲课时一般是由授课人先调查当地情况，以便在讲课中引用当地实例，用回忆、对比、算账的办法帮助党员、干部加深对政策的理解，使学员们能够边学习边改进工作。
    星桥生产大队大队长陈世周学习了“养猪应该两条腿走路，公养和私养并举”的政策后，对全队的养猪生产马上作了安排，除了继续搞好大队小队食堂的养猪生产外，还主动帮助社员解决饲料等问题。西星大队大队长林光粹通过学习理解了劳和逸的辩证关系之后，在队里和干部群众一起规定了基本劳动日，并根据各小队具体情况轮流安排休息，做到男劳力每月休息两天，女劳力每月休息四天。
    管理区的党校举办一个多月来，社员和干部中的政治空气更加浓厚，看书、看报、学习政策的人比过去大大增加。党员和干部们领导生产更加深入。西星大队六小队指导员林春香，过去工作方法比较简单，参加学习后认识到自己的缺点，在秋收冬种中坚持和群众“四同”，干活头里走，遇到问题和社员商量解决，受到群众赞扬。现在，全区党员和干部们正积极带领群众大挖河泥，为明年春耕准备充足的肥料。
