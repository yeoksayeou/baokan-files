Increase Tunneling Speed and Ensure Increased Coal Production
——On the Advanced Experience of the Qihe Zhi Youth Tunneling Team

Tunneling and coal mining are two interconnected and mutually reinforcing key aspects of coal production. Increased coal production depends on improving coal mining efficiency. Improving coal mining efficiency, in turn, requires increasing tunneling speed to provide more working faces for coal extraction. Between the two, tunneling is the preparation for coal mining, serving coal mining. Coal mining, however, is premised on tunneling, and tunneling must correspondingly stay ahead. If tunneling cannot meet the needs of coal mining, even with high coal mining efficiency and large coal mining capacity, there will be no place to use it, and it will be difficult to increase coal production. Therefore, while striving to improve coal mining efficiency, focusing on tunneling to make tunneling compatible with coal mining is required by the objective laws of coal production development.

Since the Great Leap Forward, leading cadres in many coal mines across the country have attached importance to and strengthened the leadership of tunneling work, adopting various concrete measures to strengthen tunneling, and generally improving tunneling efficiency. However, from the perspective of overall coal production, because the production of many coal mines during the Great Leap Forward greatly exceeded their original designed capacity, coal mining efficiency significantly improved, and coal production continued to grow, there is still a certain gap between tunneling and coal mining. In some mines, tunneling cannot keep up with the needs of coal mining, which seems to have become a somewhat regular phenomenon. Is this really the case? The report on the Qihe Zhi Youth Rapid Tunneling Team published in this newspaper today strongly denies this point. It proves that the "conventional" idea of tunneling lagging behind coal mining can be completely broken.

The Qihe Zhi Youth Rapid Tunneling Team is a tunneling team from the Chenjiazhuang Mine of the Hebi Mining Bureau in Henan Province. When this team was established at the end of 1957, its tunneling efficiency was very low, and it had failed to complete the national plan for three consecutive months. However, after the start of the Great Leap Forward, they increased the initial monthly efficiency of single-heading coal roadway tunneling from 54 meters to more than 500 meters (the average efficiency of general coal mines is about 200 meters per month), then from more than 500 meters to more than 1,000 meters, and then from more than 1,000 meters to 2,000 meters. In June of this year, they broke through the peak of 2,000 meters per month, increasing the monthly efficiency to more than 2,100 meters. In less than three years, they increased tunneling efficiency by nearly forty times and continuously created the highest monthly efficiency record for single-heading coal roadway tunneling in the country.

What is even more important is that not only did the Qihe Zhi Tunneling Team create a high-efficiency tunneling record of more than 2,000 meters, but all tunneling teams that learned from their experience also successively created brand-new tunneling records. According to existing materials, five tunneling teams in Henan Province have been able to maintain the monthly efficiency of coal roadway tunneling at a new height of more than 2,000 meters, reaching or exceeding the advanced level in the country, after learning from the experience of the Qihe Zhi Tunneling Team. This shows that tunneling lagging behind coal mining is not a "conventional" situation.

How to make tunneling keep up with the needs of coal mining? There are only two ways. One is to increase tunneling manpower, and the other is to improve the production efficiency of tunneling. The former method is certainly necessary in certain circumstances, but the growth of equipment and manpower is always limited, and relying solely on this method often fails to achieve the expected goals. The latter method, however, is a consistently effective and fundamentally potential method. The Qihe Zhi Tunneling Team used the latter method to increase tunneling speed.

The Qihe Zhi Tunneling Team had a very weak original technical foundation and poor production conditions. What is the secret to their rapid and substantial increase in tunneling efficiency? The secret lies in the team's conscientious and down-to-earth, in-depth and meticulous study of the tunneling production process and mastering the internal regularity of tunneling work.

No matter what we do, if we want to do it well, an indispensable condition is to be very familiar with the matter itself and the various aspects related to it. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Denying the necessity of delving into the essence of things and meticulously studying the characteristics of contradictions, merely standing there and looking at a distance, roughly seeing a little of the appearance of contradictions, and then wanting to solve the contradictions (answer questions, resolve disputes, handle work, command war). Such practices inevitably lead to chaos." ("On Contradiction") This means that no matter what problem we solve, we must deeply understand the essence and characteristics of the problem (contradiction). In war, knowing oneself and the enemy is the key to winning every battle; in production, only by fully familiarizing ourselves with and mastering the objective laws of the production process can we continuously improve production efficiency. The key is to "size up the situation" in the overall situation, that is, in the overall understanding of the actual situation, grasp the main contradictions, and effectively solve the main contradictions. The Qihe Zhi Tunneling Team, based on a full analysis and study of the tunneling production process, found that the main keys to tunneling are drilling and blasting and underground transportation. The speed of drilling and blasting and the amount of blasting are directly related to the level of tunneling efficiency. Underground transportation is the prerequisite for timely and continuous advancement of drilling and blasting. Improving transportation efficiency can open up work sites for drilling and blasting at a faster rate. In this way, they came to the correct judgment: whether tunneling can stay ahead of coal mining depends on improving the labor efficiency of drilling and blasting and underground transportation.

But how can we improve the labor efficiency of drilling and blasting and underground transportation? The second experience of the Qihe Zhi Youth Tunneling Team is to persistently carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, replacing low-efficiency production methods with high-efficiency production methods. When carrying out technical revolution, they also used the method of concentrating superior forces to fight annihilation battles. According to the laws of tunneling production, they first concentrated their efforts to grasp the key of drilling and blasting, creating a complete set of new drilling and blasting technologies and methods. After the efficiency of drilling and blasting improved, the problem of underground transportation became prominent. They concentrated their efforts again, vigorously carried out technical revolution in underground transportation, and created a complete set of underground transportation machinery, thereby basically realizing the mechanization of the entire tunneling production process. Because they adopted the method of concentrating superior forces to fight annihilation battles, they ensured that the problem was solved quickly and thoroughly. When carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, they consistently adhered to the principle of starting from specific conditions, using foreign methods when possible, using local methods when possible, and combining foreign and local methods, fully considering China's existing material and technical conditions and the material and technical conditions of the enterprise itself, and developing and applying China's traditional experience in tunneling technology. Therefore, the newly created tunneling machinery has the characteristics of using less materials, being easy to manufacture, easy to use, and having high efficiency. This ensures that the new technologies and new methods are easy to promote and adhere to.

The complete set of new tunneling technology experience and mechanization methods created by the Qihe Zhi Youth Rapid Tunneling Team is a successful experience for completely changing the situation of tunneling lagging behind coal mining, continuously improving tunneling labor productivity, and ensuring the continuous leap forward in coal production. Seriously learning and promoting this experience can promote a substantial and large-scale increase in coal production. However, to learn the technical experience and mechanization methods of the Qihe Zhi Tunneling Team, we must first learn their proletarian revolutionary spirit of daring to revolutionize, being down-to-earth, and striving for progress, and learn their work style of combining the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and act with the scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts. The reason why this team was able to increase production efficiency by nearly forty times, save about one-third of the labor force, and create such vital and efficient new technologies and new methods in such poor conditions in just over two years is because they were not intimidated by the poor conditions and low technology. On the contrary, they believed that socialist construction requires coal, requires more coal mining, and tunneling must keep up. It was this infinite love for the cause of socialism and a high sense of responsibility that guided them to dare to fight against difficulties and overcome difficulties. The reason why the Qihe Zhi Tunneling Team can continuously create new records for single-heading coal roadway tunneling in the country is also because they have a broad vision and a noble communist style. They never care about the gains and losses of their own team, nor are they satisfied with their existing achievements. As Comrade Qihe Zhi, the captain of the team and a member of the Communist Party, often said: "Socialism cannot be built by one person. Our team only advances a little more than 2,000 meters per month, and ten teams only advance a little more than 20,000 meters, which is far from meeting the requirements of socialist construction!" Based on this understanding, they always start from the interests of socialism in everything they do, and they are not arrogant or complacent, helping others to catch up with themselves. It is because of this style that they can not be satisfied with their existing achievements, continuously study and absorb new nourishment, and constantly improve themselves. This is a fundamental secret to the Qihe Zhi Tunneling Team's substantial improvement in tunneling efficiency.

    提高掘进速度　确保煤炭增产
    ——论齐合只青年掘进队的先进经验
    掘进和采煤，是煤炭生产的两个相互联系，相互促进的重要环节。煤炭的增产，取决于采煤效率的提高。采煤效率的提高，又要求提高掘进速度，提供更多的工作面来开采煤炭。二者之间，掘进是采煤的准备，它服务于采煤。而采煤又以掘进为前提，掘进要相应地走在前面。如果掘进不能适应采煤的需要，纵然有很高的采煤效率，很大的采煤能力，也是找不到用武之地，很难增产更多的煤炭。因此，在努力提高采煤效率的同时，狠抓掘进，使掘进和采煤相适应，是煤炭生产发展的客观规律所要求的。
  大跃进以来，全国许多煤矿的领导干部都重视和加强了对掘进工作的领导，采取了各种加强掘进的具体措施，普遍提高了掘进效率。然而，从整个煤炭生产来看，由于许多煤矿的生产在大跃进中都大大地超过了原有的设计能力，采煤效率显著提高，煤炭产量不断增长，这就使得掘进和采煤之间仍然存在着一定的距离。在一些矿井里，掘进跟不上采煤的需要，好像成了一种带有规律性的现象。事实果真如此吗？本报今天发表的齐合只青年快速掘进队的报道，有力地否定了这一点。它证明：掘进落后于采煤的“常规”，是完全可以打破的。
    齐合只青年快速掘进队，是河南省鹤壁矿务局陈家庄矿的一个掘进队。这个队在1957年底成立时，掘进效率十分低下，接连有三个月没有完成过国家计划。但是，大跃进开始以后，他们把最初的煤巷单孔掘进月效率由五十四米提高到了五百多米（一般煤矿平均效率是月进二百米左右），再由五百多米提高到一千多米，再由一千多米提高到二千米。今年6月，又突破了月进两千米的高峰，把月进效率提高到二千一百米以上。不到三年时间，他们把掘进效率提高了近四十倍，并且接连不断地创造出全国煤巷单孔掘进的最高月效率。
    重要之点还在于：不但齐合只掘进队一个队创造了二千米以上的高效率的掘进纪录，而且凡是学习了他们的经验的掘进队，也都接二连三地创造出了崭新的掘进纪录。根据已有的材料，河南省已经有五个掘进队在学习了齐合只掘进队的经验以后，都能把煤巷掘进月效率保持在两千米以上的新高度，达到或超过了全国的先进水平。这就说明，掘进落后于采煤并不是什么“常规”。
    怎样使掘进跟上采煤的需要呢？办法不外两个。一个是增加掘进力量，一个是提高掘进的生产效率。前一个办法，在一定的情况下，固然是需要的，但设备和人力的增长总是有一定限度的，只依靠这个办法，往往并不能达到预期的目标。后一种办法，却是经常有效的、潜力很大的根本办法。齐合只掘进队就是采用后一种办法提高掘进速度的。
    齐合只掘进队原有的技术基础很薄弱，生产条件也很差，他们能如此迅速和大幅度地提高掘进效率的秘诀何在？秘诀就在于这个掘进队认真踏实，深入细致地研究了掘进生产过程，掌握了掘进工作的内在规律性。
    我们无论做什么事情，要想把这件事办好，一个必不可少的条件就是要很熟悉这件事情本身以及与它相联系的各个方面。毛泽东同志说过：“否认深入事物里面精细地研究矛盾特点的必要，仅仅站在那里远远地望一望，粗枝大叶地看到一点矛盾的形相，就想动手去解决矛盾（答复问题、解决纠纷、处理工作、指挥战争）。这样的做法，没有不出乱子的。”（《矛盾论》）这就是说，我们不论解决什么问题，都要对问题（矛盾）的本质和特点深知深解。在战争中，要知己知彼，方能百战不殆；在生产中，也只有充分熟悉和掌握生产过程的客观规律性，才能不断地提高生产效率。这中间，关键的一条，是要在总体上也就是在对实际的全盘了解中“审时度势”地抓住主要矛盾，并且切实解决主要矛盾，齐合只掘进队出于充分地分析研究了掘进生产过程，发现了掘进的主要关键是打眼爆破和井下运输。打眼爆破的进度快慢，爆破量的大小，是与掘进效率的高低直接相关的。井下运输，则是打眼爆破能否及时地不断向前推进的前提。运输效率提高了，就能够以更快的速度为打眼爆破开辟出工作场所。正是这样，就使他们得出了正确的判断：掘进能否走在采煤前面，关键在于提高打眼爆破和井下运输的劳动效率。
    可是怎样才能提高打眼爆破和井下运输的劳动效率呢？齐合只青年掘进队的第二条经验就是坚持不懈地开展技术革新和技术革命，用高效率的生产方法来代替低效率的生产方法。在进行技术革命的时候，他们又运用了集中优势兵力打歼灭战的方法，根据掘进生产的规律，首先集中力量抓住打眼爆破这个关键，创造出一整套打眼爆破的新技术、新方法。当打眼爆破的效率提高以后，井下运输这个环节的问题，暴露得突出了，他们又集中力量，大力开展井下运输的技术革命，创造出一整套井下运输机械，从而基本上实现了掘进生产全部过程的机械化。由于他们采取了集中优势兵力打歼灭战的办法，就保证了问题解决得快，解决得彻底。在开展技术革新和技术革命的时候，他们又始终如一地坚持了从具体条件出发，能洋则洋，能土则土，土洋结合的原则，充分考虑了我国现有的物质技术条件，企业本身的物质技术条件，发展和运用了我国掘进技术的传统经验，因而新创造出的掘进机械，具有用料少，制造容易，使用方便和效率高的特点。这样，就保证了新技术、新方法易于普遍推广和坚持使用下去。
    齐合只青年快速掘进队创造的一整套新的掘进技术经验和机械化方法，是彻底改变掘进落后于采煤的状况，不断提高掘进劳动生产率，确保煤炭生产持续跃进的成功经验，认真学习推广这项经验，就可以促使煤炭生产实现大幅度、大面积增产。但是要学习齐合只掘进队的技术经验和机械化方法，又必须首先学习他们那种敢于革命、脚踏实地、发愤图强的无产阶级的革命精神，学习他们那种把敢想敢干的革命精神和实事求是的科学精神结合起来的工作作风。这个队所以能够在那样差的条件下，在短短的两年多的时间内，把生产效率提高近四十倍，节省出三分之一左右的劳动力，并且创造出这样富有生命力和高效率的新技术和新方法，就是因为他们没有让条件差、技术低所吓倒，相反，却认为社会主义建设要煤，要多采煤，掘进就一定要赶上去。正是这种对社会主义事业的无限热爱和高度的责任心，引导着他们敢于和困难作斗争，并且战胜困难。齐合只掘进队所以能不断创造出全国煤巷单孔掘进的新纪录，还在于他们具有远大的目光，具有高尚的共产主义风格。他们从不计较自己小队的得失，也不满足于已有的成就。正如这个队的队长、共产党员齐合只同志经常所说的一样：“社会主义不是一个人可以建成的。我们一个队月进不过两千多米，十个队也才两万多米，跟社会主义建设的要求相比，还差得远哩！”基于这种认识，他们总是处处从社会主义利益出发，不骄不傲，帮助别人，赶上自己。正是因为有了这种风格，他们才能不满足于已有的成就，不断地钻研学习，吸收新的营养，使自己不断提高。这是齐合只掘进队大幅度提高掘进效率的一个根本秘诀。
