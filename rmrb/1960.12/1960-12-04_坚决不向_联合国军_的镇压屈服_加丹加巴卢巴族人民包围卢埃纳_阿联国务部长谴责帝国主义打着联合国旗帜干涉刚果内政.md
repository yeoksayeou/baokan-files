Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd dispatch from Elisabethville: Approximately three thousand Baluba people today surrounded Luena, the coal mining center in Katanga Province controlled by the Tshombe clique.

It is reported that at approximately four o'clock this morning, an armed force of approximately one hundred and fifty Baluba people, armed with bows and arrows, wooden sticks, and some homemade guns, stormed into the city of Luena, launched an attack on the Tshombe clique's police station, and engaged in fierce combat with the reactionary Tshombe police.

The 350 "UN forces" stationed there interfered arbitrarily in the patriotic armed struggle of the Baluba people, opening fire on Baluba patriots alongside Tshombe's police to suppress them. The Baluba patriots put up a heroic resistance.

The interventionist atrocities of the "UN forces" enraged more Baluba people, and approximately three thousand Baluba people immediately surrounded Luena despite the "UN forces'" suppression.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 1st: United Arab Republic Minister of State Hatem today condemned the United Nations for acting as a tool of imperialism in the Congo.

Hatem said, "Four months after the United Nations intervened in the Congo, the situation there has become even worse, and the doors of the Congo have been opened to imperialist countries, allowing them to carry out their conspiracies under the protection of the UN flag."

He said, "Under the flag of the United Nations, imperialist countries have been able to strengthen the position of their puppets and put them in power; under the flag of the United Nations, imperialist countries and their puppets dissolved the Congolese parliament and arrested some members of parliament; under the flag of the United Nations, Belgian imperialism killed thousands of Congolese people and expelled approximately ten thousand refugees."

Hatem said that what has happened in the Congo has discredited the reputation of the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 29th dispatch: According to a report from Leopoldville by the Middle East News Agency on the 28th, the result of four months of UN intervention in the Congo is that the independence of the Congo has been severely undermined, and "the United Nations has lost its prestige and dignity and is now regarded as a tool for implementing imperialist policies."

The report said that people from all walks of life in the Congo are accusing Hammarskjöld and the UN representatives in the Congo. They said, "Since arriving in the Congo, the UN military headquarters has been pursuing the plans of Western imperialism in the Congo."

The message continued, "The United States and Western imperialist countries are continuing to carry out conspiracies there, attempting to find a ruler who supports them and overthrow the Lumumba national government."

An editorial published in Cairo's *Al-Goumhouria* on the 29th pointed out, "The events in the Congo are nothing but the natural result of an imperialist policy planned by the United States and Western imperialist countries and meticulously implemented by the UN military headquarters in the Congo." The newspaper continued, the Congolese people are "again being subjected to the enslavement of colonialists, who are disguised as United Nations troops, commanded by the UN military headquarters which is working for colonialism."

Damascus's *Al-Youm* also published an editorial on the 29th saying: "The stance adopted and the activities carried out by UN officials in the Congo clearly reveal the imperialist conspiracy, the purpose of which is to establish a regime in the Congo controlled by imperialists."

The editorial condemned the United Nations for destroying Lumumba's legitimate government and supporting the traitor Mobutu.

    新华社2日讯　伊利沙伯维尔消息：约三千名巴卢巴族人今天包围了冲伯集团盘踞下的加丹加省煤矿中心卢埃纳。
    据报道，今天早晨四点钟左右，一支约一百五十人的巴卢巴族人民武装，带着弓箭、木棍和一些土枪冲进卢埃纳城，向冲伯集团警察局发动攻击，并同冲伯反动警察展开激烈的战斗。
    那里的三百五十名“联合国军”对巴卢巴族人的爱国武装斗争横加干涉，同冲伯的警察一起向巴卢巴爱国者开枪镇压。巴卢巴爱国者进行了英勇的抗击。
    “联合国军”的干涉暴行激怒了更多的巴卢巴族人，约三千名巴卢巴族人不顾“联合国军”的镇压立即包围了卢埃纳。
    新华社开罗1日电　阿拉伯联合共和国国务部长哈特姆今天在这里谴责联合国在刚果充当帝国主义的工具。
    哈特姆说，“联合国干涉刚果四个月后，那里的局势变得更加恶化了，刚果的大门已向帝国主义国家敞开，使它们在联合国旗帜的保护下，进行它们的阴谋活动。”
    他说，“在联合国的旗帜下，帝国主义国家能够加强他们的傀儡的地位并把他们扶植上台；在联合国的旗帜下，帝国主义国家和它们的傀儡解散了刚果的议会并逮捕了一些议员；在联合国的旗帜下，比利时帝国主义杀害了数以千计的刚果人，并驱逐了大约一万名难民。”
    哈特姆说，在刚果所发生的事情使联合国的声誉扫地。
    据新华社开罗29日电　据中东通讯社28日从利奥波德维尔发出的一则消息报道，四个月来联合国干涉刚果的结果，刚果的独立遭到严重破坏，“联合国失去了它的威信和尊严，它现在被人认为是执行帝国主义政策的工具”。
    这则消息说，在刚果的各国人士都指责哈马舍尔德和联合国驻刚果代表。他们说，“联合国军司令部自从到达刚果以来，一直在刚果奉行西方帝国主义的计划。”
    消息接着说，“美国和西方帝国主义国家正在那里继续进行阴谋活动，企图物色一个支持它们和推翻卢蒙巴全国政府的统治者。”
    开罗《共和国报》29日发表的社论指出，“刚果发生的事件，不过是美国和西方帝国主义国家策划的、并由驻刚果的联合国军司令部缜密执行的帝国主义政策的自然结果。”这家报纸继续说，刚果人民正“再次受到殖民主义者的奴役统治，殖民主义者伪装成为联合国部队，受着为殖民主义出力的联合国军司令部的指挥”。
    大马士革的《今天报》29日也发表社论说：“联合国官员在刚果所采取的立场、所进行的活动都清楚地揭示帝国主义的阴谋，其目的在于在刚果建立帝国主义者控制之下的政权”。
    社论谴责联合国摧毁卢蒙巴的合法政权、支持卖国贼蒙博托。
