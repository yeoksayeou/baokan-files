    Chairman Mao's Inscription as Award
    In the Anti-Japanese War Hall of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Museum, there is a certificate inscribed by Chairman Mao on display. This certificate is on a piece of white cloth the size of a handkerchief, on which Chairman Mao wrote the four characters "Lead by Example" with a brush.
    This certificate was awarded to Comrade Luo Zhang, a cadre of the 359th Brigade of the Eighth Route Army, in February 1943. Comrade Luo Zhang took the lead actively and set an example in the Nanniwan Great Production Movement, sharing weal and woe with the soldiers, and therefore received this glorious award.
    Leading by example is our glorious revolutionary tradition. In the past arduous years of revolutionary war, our Communists and revolutionary cadres shared joys and sorrows with the masses and overcame difficulties together by setting an example. They endured hardship first, were not afraid of sacrifice, worked diligently, and motivated the masses to achieve the great victory of the revolution.
    The fine style of leading by example needs to be promoted and carried forward in our great socialist construction cause today. Chairman Mao's inscription, like a bright mirror, will forever illuminate our minds and inspire us to move forward.

    毛主席写的奖状
    在中国人民革命军事博物馆抗日战争馆里，陈列着一个毛主席题的奖状。这个奖状是在一块手帕大小的白布上，毛主席用毛笔写下了“以身作则”四个字。
    这个奖状是在1943年2月，奖给八路军三五九旅干部罗章同志的。罗章同志在南泥湾大生产运动中，积极带头，以身作则，和战士们同甘共苦，因此受到了这光荣的奖励。
    以身作则，是我们光荣的革命传统。在过去艰苦的革命战争年代里，我们共产党人和革命干部就是以身作则地和群众同甘苦、共患难的。他们吃苦在先，不怕牺牲，埋头苦干，带动群众，取得了革命的伟大胜利。
    以身作则的优良作风，在我们今天伟大的社会主义建设事业中，更需要发扬光大。毛主席这一题字，像一面明亮的镜子，永远照亮我们的头脑，鼓舞着我们前进。
