Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 8th: Shanghai textile industry workers are vigorously engaged in product reform to produce durable products. According to incomplete statistics from the past five months, the durability of more than 100 types of textile and knitwear products has been improved. The increased product durability not only benefits consumers but also saves a large amount of social wealth.

Using chemical methods to treat products is an important way to improve the fastness of textile and knitwear products. The towels produced by the Shanghai Pacific Weaving Factory are specially treated to make the loops spiral. They were tested in barbershops for six months and washed more than 15,000 times without damage, while ordinary towels would be damaged after half a month and about 1,300 washes. The fastness of floral poplin, socks, canvas for sneakers, and collar linings that have been chemically treated has been doubled compared to products that have not been chemically treated, according to physical tests.

Reasonably improving fabric design and changing tailoring methods are also important ways to extend the service life of fabrics. The collar and cuffs of shirts or cotton undershirts are the most easily damaged parts. The Yingyin Knitting Factory reinforces the ribs of the cuffs and collars of double-yarn cotton undershirts with nylon. The shoulder seams of cotton undershirts are prone to damage, so a piece of cloth is added inside when sewing. Although the measure is simple, it can achieve the effect of one double-yarn cotton undershirt lasting as long as two. When buying a new pair of socks, after wearing them for a period, the sock legs are still good, but the toes and heels often break first. In order to meet consumer demand, many sock factories in Shanghai reinforce the toes and heels with nylon or ply yarn. The increase in raw materials is small, but the wearing time can be greatly extended. Shanghai Unified Towel Factory, Shanghai Towel Factory No. 2, and other factories have changed the rarely used loops on both sides of the towel to plain weave, printed novel patterns, and used the saved cotton yarn to increase the density in the middle of the towel. Without increasing cotton yarn, the towel's fastness is increased by 25%.

The trial production of durable products in Shanghai's textile industry is carried out through mass movements inside and outside the factories. Workers in knitwear factories proposed more than 200 suggestions for improving the design and tailoring methods of knitwear in just over ten days. Many factories have established "three-in-one" groups composed of leading cadres, workers, technicians, and scientific research institution personnel to pool everyone's wisdom, determine the direction of reform, explore process rules, and appraise product performance.

At present, the staff and workers of Shanghai's textile industrial departments are simultaneously trial-producing and trial-selling new durable products and gradually producing products that have been initially successfully tested in small batches to meet the needs of the broad masses of consumers.

Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, December 8th: The "Wuhe" brand rubber shoes produced by Qingdao Rubber Factory No. 9 are continuously improving in quality while increasing production. The wearing time of long sneakers increased from 123.5 days in the first half of last year to 207 days in the second half of last year, and further to 248.4 days in the first half of this year. The wearing time of "Lishi" shoes increased from 123.9 days in the first half of last year to 141 days in the second half of last year, and further to 160 days in the first half of this year. The wearing time of both types of shoes has been further extended in the second half of the year, and the appearance has also reached the national standards.

### 上海大力增产耐用纺织品  青岛五和牌胶鞋在高产的同时穿用时间一再延长

    上海大力增产耐用纺织品
    青岛五和牌胶鞋在高产的同时穿用时间一再延长
    据新华社上海8日电　上海纺织工业职工大搞产品改革，生产耐用产品。据最近五个月来的不完全统计，已有一百多种纺织、针织品提高了耐用性能。产品牢度提高，不仅为广大消费者带来了利益，而且可以节约大量社会财富。
    运用化学方法处理，是提高纺织、针织产品坚牢程度的重要途径。上海太平洋织造厂生产的毛巾，经过特殊处理，毛圈成螺旋形，送到理发店试用六个月，洗涤一万五千多次，仍然完整无损；而一般毛巾用半个月，洗涤一千三百多次，就会损坏。经过化学处理的花府绸、袜子、球鞋帆布、领衬布等，经过物理试验，牢度都比未经化学处理的产品提高一倍左右。
    合理改进织物设计，改变剪裁方法，也是延长织物使用寿命的重要方法。衬衣或棉毛衫，最容易破损的地方是领口、袖头。莹荫针织厂把双纱棉毛衫袖口、领口的罗纹，用尼龙加固，棉毛衫挂肩容易破损，在缝制时就在里面衬块布，事情虽很简单，却可以收到一件双纱棉毛衫抵两件穿的效果。新买一双袜子，穿一个时期，袜筒还很好，但袜头和后跟往往先破。上海许多袜厂为了满足消费者的要求，把袜头和后跟用尼龙或股线加固，增加的原料不多，而穿用的时间却可以大大延长。上海统一毛巾厂、上海毛巾二厂等，将毛巾两边两头不大使用的毛圈改为平纹，印上新颖的花型图案，把节省下来的棉纱用来增加毛巾中间的密度，不需增加棉纱，就使毛巾的牢度提高25％。
    上海纺织行业试制耐穿耐用的产品，是通过厂内厂外的群众运动来进行的。针织内衣厂的职工在十几天之内就提出了二百多件改进针织品设计与剪裁方法的建议。许多厂成立了有领导干部参加的工人、技术人员与科学研究机关人员组成的“三结合”小组，集中大家智慧，确定改革方向，摸索工艺规律，鉴定产品性能。
    目前，上海纺织工业部门的职工正在一面试制试销新的耐用产品，一面陆续小批生产已经初步试验成功的产品，满足广大消费者的需要。
    据新华社青岛8日电　青岛橡胶九厂出产的“五和牌”胶鞋在提高产量的同时，质量不断提高。长球鞋的穿用时间去年上半年是一百二十三天半，去年下半年提高到二百零七天，今年上半年又提高到二百四十八点四天。力士鞋穿用时间去年上半年是一百二十三点九天，去年下半年提高到一百四十一天，今年上半年又提高到一百六十天。下半年两种鞋的穿用时间都进一步延长，外观也都达到了国家规定标准。
