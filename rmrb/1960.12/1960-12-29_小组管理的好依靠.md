    Good Reliance on Group Management
    To be a good production team leader, one must give full play to the role of the worker administrators in the team. I have some experience in this regard.
    In the past, I used to come to work half an hour early every day to prepare tools and materials, assign tasks, and after work, I would inspect the finished products and clean up the site. I was busy all day, but the group management work was still not done well. When the group first established positions like plan dispatcher, technical inspector, tool and material clerk, cost accountant, recorder, and propagandist, I didn't boldly entrust much work to them, and the group work was still not managed very well. With the specific help of the Party committee work group, I realized that only by relying on the masses can we do a good job in management. I paid attention to giving play to the role of worker administrators and initially summarized some good working methods, which achieved remarkable results.
    I feel that the better working methods are: First, assign work to the worker administrators every three days or once a week. When assigning work, always clarify the key points of the work according to the central tasks of each period and put forward different requirements accordingly. This allows them to have a clear direction and work more methodically.
    Second, provide specific help to them to overcome difficulties. When worker Wei Duo first took on the job of cost accountant, he was worried that cost accounting was complicated and would affect his production tasks. I promptly had an individual conversation with him to explain that as long as he arranged his work well, it would definitely not affect production; at the same time, I asked the workshop accountant to specifically help him familiarize himself with the business knowledge, so that he mastered the method of group cost accounting in a very short period of time. Not only did he do a good job as a worker administrator, but he also completed his production tasks beautifully.
    Third, check the work of the worker administrators once every one to three days. Before leaving work every day, I focus on checking the original records and quality status, and check the cost accounting situation every three days; at the same time, I check the work of the worker administrators at the meeting of the Party group leader, production team leader, and trade union group leader or the core leadership group meeting (including the Youth League group leader, veteran workers, and activists). Now, the group's various necessary forms, reports, and systems can be maintained, which is one of the main reasons.
    Fourth, mobilize all workers in the group to study and improve the group management methods to promote worker administrators to carry out activities better. For example, the tool and material distribution and storage work in our group used to be relatively chaotic, and the tool and material clerk, Comrade Li Jinzhang, also felt a headache. I convened several special meetings to study specific improvement methods, and everyone worked together to make toolboxes and established tool receipt and issuance accounts. Now, the distribution and storage of tools and materials are very orderly, and the phenomenon of loss and damage without cause has not occurred again.

### 小组管理的好依靠

    小组管理的好依靠
    要当好生产小组长，必须充分发挥小组工人管理员的作用。在这方面，我有一些体会。
    过去，我每天提前半小时上班，准备工具、材料，分派活，下班后，检验成品，收拾现场，整天忙忙碌碌，但是小组管理工作还是搞得不好。小组刚建立计划调度员、技术检验员、工具材料员、成本核算员、记录员、宣传员的时候，许多工作没有大胆地交给他们去做，小组工作仍然没有管理得很好。在党委工作组的具体帮助下，我认识到只有依靠群众，才能搞好管理，注意发挥了工人管理员的作用，并且初步总结出一些好的工作方法，收到了显著的成效。
    我感觉比较好的工作方法是：一、三天或一周向工人管理员布置一次工作。布置工作时，都根据各个时期的中心任务，明确交代工作重点，分别提出不同的要求。这样就可以使他们方向明确，工作更有计划。
    二、具体帮助他们克服困难。工人魏铎刚担任成本核算员的时候，担心成本核算工作复杂，影响自己完成生产任务。我便及时找他个别谈话，对他说明只要把工作安排好，绝不会影响生产；同时，请车间核算员具体帮助他熟悉业务知识，使他在很短时间内掌握了小组成本核算的方法。他不但搞好了工人管理员的工作，生产任务也完成得很漂亮。
    三、一天或三天检查一次工人管理员的工作。我在每天下班前，都重点检查一次原始记录、质量情况，三天检查一次成本核算情况；同时，在党小组长、生产小组长、工会小组长碰头会或核心领导小组会议（包括团小组长、老工人、积极分子）上检查工人管理员的工作。现在，小组的各种必要的表报、制度都能坚持，这是主要原因之一。
    四、发动全组工人研究改进小组管理办法，促进工人管理员更好地开展活动。例如，我们小组的工具材料领发、保管工作过去比较乱，工具材料员李锦章同志也感到很头痛。我便几次召集专门会议研究具体改进办法，大家动手做起工具箱，建立了工具收发账。现在，工具材料的领发和保管都很有秩序，丢失和无故损坏的现象再没有发生过。
