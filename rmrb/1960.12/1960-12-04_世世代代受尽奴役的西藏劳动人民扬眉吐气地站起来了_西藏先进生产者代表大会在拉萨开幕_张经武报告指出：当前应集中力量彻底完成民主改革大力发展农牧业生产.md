Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, December 3rd. The Tibet Autonomous Region's Advanced Collective and Advanced Producers Congress opened in Lhasa on the 2nd. More than 400 representatives from various production and construction fronts in Tibet participated in the conference. Among these representatives, farmers and herdsmen accounted for more than 80%, and nearly 400 were former serfs and slaves.

The sun shone brightly on Lhasa, the city of sunshine, on the 2nd. The venue of the conference, the Lhasa Auditorium in front of the Potala Palace, was newly decorated.

At 10:30 a.m., the conference opened in the solemn sound of the national anthem. Tan Guansan, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a congratulatory speech on behalf of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China amidst warm applause. He said: This conference is being held in a situation where the democratic reform in Tibet has achieved great victories, agricultural production has achieved bumper harvests, and great achievements have been made on other production fronts.

He said: With the great victory of the democratic reform, agricultural production in Tibet has achieved a bumper harvest this year; animal husbandry production has also made new developments; industrial production and transportation have also developed more than last year; finance, trade, culture, education, health, handicraft production, etc., have all achieved great results in serving the Party's central work, serving production, and serving the people's lives.

He said: The great achievements we have made in a short period of more than a year fully prove that the various principles and policies formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are completely correct. As long as we resolutely implement the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we will be invincible. At the same time, it also proves that the liberated Tibetan working people have infinite wisdom and creativity.

The conference also read out a congratulatory telegram from Panchen Erdeni, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, who is currently inspecting various parts of the country. The telegram said: The convening of this conference is a great event for the Tibetan people. In the telegram, he described the great victories achieved in Tibet since the suppression of the rebellion and the implementation of democratic reforms. He said: All this makes us deeply realize that the Party's leadership is the most important thing, and Mao Zedong Thought is the lighthouse for the eternal victory of all our work. The unity of the people of all fraternal nationalities in the country is an important guarantee for the common prosperity and common development of all our nationalities. He encouraged the representatives to further improve their work and strive for greater glory for the motherland and the people.

Zhang Jingwu, Representative of the Central People's Government in Tibet and Secretary of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a report at the meeting. He analyzed in detail the excellent situation in Tibet and the great achievements made in the past year and more, and elaborated on the Party's various policies in Tibet and the future tasks in Tibet. He said: The great victory of the democratic reform has made the most reactionary, darkest, most cruel, and most barbaric feudal serf system in Tibet, which was vigorously supported and extremely loved by imperialism, gone forever. The millions of serfs who had been exploited and enslaved for generations have gained freedom and liberation, and have stood up with pride. Under the leadership of the Party, they have established their own democratic power - people's governments at all levels and peasant and herdsmen associations, exercising the right to be masters of their own affairs and managing all affairs within their own ethnic group. In terms of economy, the broad masses of working people have also achieved a great turnaround. After the "Three Antis (anti-rebellion, anti-Ula corvée system, anti-personal dependence) and Two Reductions (rent reduction and interest reduction)" and land reform, the working people have for the first time their own land, livestock and other means of production. The result of changing the serf owners' ownership of the means of production to peasant ownership has liberated the productive forces, and the enthusiasm of the people for production has been unprecedentedly high. Bumper harvests have been achieved for two consecutive years, and the people's lives have been improved. New ideas and new moral qualities of the broad masses of working people are constantly emerging, and people's mental outlook is undergoing profound changes. People-run primary schools and night schools and after-school training classes for adults have been established in large numbers. He pointed out that this fundamental and profound change that has taken place in Tibet in less than two years is a victory for the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's ethnic policy, and a victory for Mao Zedong Thought. He then elaborated on the Party's policies on suppressing the rebellion of the reactionary clique in the upper strata of Tibet, implementing democratic reforms, and carrying out united front work with people in the upper strata of Tibet, and called on all Party members and cadres, all advanced producers and activists to conscientiously study the Party's policies, actively publicize the Party's policies to the people, and resolutely implement the Party's policies so that the Party's policies can be truly grasped by the broad masses of people.

In his report, Zhang Jingwu analyzed the nature and tasks of the current revolution in Tibet. He pointed out that Tibet is still in the stage of democratic revolution. At present, we should concentrate our efforts on thoroughly completing the democratic reform, continue to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, consolidate the leadership of the proletariat, thoroughly eliminate the remnants of the feudal serf system, thoroughly eliminate the ideological influence of imperialism and foreign reactionaries, develop the new democratic economy and culture, rapidly improve the people's awareness, train ethnic cadres, and carry out Party building and Youth League building. He pointed out that only after thoroughly completing this series of tasks can Tibet better transition to the stage of socialist revolution.

In the final part of his report, Zhang Jingwu pointed out that we must strive to do the following tasks well in the future: first, continue to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, consolidate and expand the people's democratic united

    张经武报告指出：当前应集中力量彻底完成民主改革大力发展农牧业生产
    新华社拉萨3日电　西藏全区先进集体和先进生产者代表大会2日在拉萨开幕。来自西藏各地各个生产建设战线上的四百多名代表参加了大会。这些代表中农、牧民占80％以上，有近四百人是过去的农奴和奴隶。
    日光城拉萨2日阳光灿烂。大会会场——布达拉宫前的拉萨大礼堂布置得焕然一新。
    上午十时半，大会在庄严的国歌声中开幕。中共西藏工委副书记谭冠三在热烈的掌声中代表中共西藏工委致祝词。他说：这次大会是在西藏地区的民主改革取得伟大胜利，农业生产获得丰收和其它各个生产战线上都取得巨大成绩的情况下召开的。
    他说：随着民主改革的伟大胜利，西藏地区的农业生产今年获得了丰收；牧业生产也有新发展；工业生产和交通运输事业等也比去年有了发展，财贸、文教卫生、手工业生产等，在为党的中心工作服务、为生产服务、为群众生活服务等方面，都取得了很大成绩。
    他说：我们在短短的一年多的时间里所取得的巨大成绩，充分证明了党中央和毛主席所制定的各项方针政策是完全正确的，只要我们坚决执行党中央和毛主席的指示，我们就会无往而不胜；同时也证明了解放了的西藏劳动人民有着无穷无尽的智慧和创造力。
    大会还宣读了正在祖国各地视察的全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼的贺电。贺电说：这次大会的召开是西藏人民的一件大喜事。他在电报中叙述了西藏在平叛和实行民主改革以来所取得的伟大胜利，他说：这一切使我们深深体会到，千条万条，党的领导第一条，毛泽东思想是我们一切工作永远胜利的灯塔，全国各兄弟民族人民的团结，是我们各民族共同繁荣、共同发展的重要保证。他勉励代表们要进一步做好工作，为祖国、为人民争取更大的光荣。
    中央人民政府驻西藏代表、中共西藏工委书记张经武在会上作了报告。他详细分析了西藏地区的大好形势和一年多来取得的伟大成就，阐述了党在西藏的各项政策和西藏地区今后的任务。他说：民主改革的伟大胜利，使帝国主义所极力支持和异常钟爱的西藏的最反动、最黑暗、最残酷、最野蛮的封建农奴制度一去不复返了。世世代代受尽剥削和奴役的百万农奴获得了自由解放，扬眉吐气地站起来了。他们在党的领导下，建立了自己的民主政权——各级人民政府和农、牧民协会，行使当家作主的权利，管理着本民族内部的一切事务。在经济上，广大劳动人民也获得了大翻身。经过“三反（反叛乱、反乌拉差役制度、反人身依附）双减（减租减息）”和土地改革，劳动人民第一次有了自己的土地、牲畜和其他生产资料。把农奴主的生产资料所有制改变为农民所有制的结果，使生产力得到了解放，人民群众的生产积极性空前高涨，连续两年夺得丰收，人民的生活已经有了改善。广大劳动人民的新的思想和新的道德品质正在不断出现，人们的精神面貌正在经历着深刻的变化。民办小学和成年人的夜校和业余训练班已经大量兴办起来。他指出，西藏地区在不到两年时间里所发生的这一根本的、深刻的变化，是党中央和毛主席的民族政策的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。他接着就党对平息西藏上层反动集团的叛乱、实行民主改革和对西藏上层人士的统一战线工作等方面的政策问题作了阐述，要求全体党员和干部、全体先进生产者和积极分子认真地学习党的政策，积极地向人民群众宣传党的政策，坚决贯彻执行党的政策，使党的政策真正为广大群众所掌握。
    张经武在报告中分析了目前西藏地区革命的性质和任务，他指出，西藏目前仍然处于民主革命的阶段，当前应集中力量彻底完成民主改革，继续巩固人民民主专政，巩固无产阶级的领导权，彻底肃清封建农奴制度的残余，彻底肃清帝国主义和外国反动派的思想影响，发展新民主主义的经济和文化，迅速提高人民群众的觉悟程度，培养民族干部，进行建党建团。他指出，只有在彻底完成这一系列的任务后，西藏才能更好地转变到社会主义革命的阶段。
    张经武在报告的最后指出，今后必须努力作好下面几项工作：第一，继续巩固人民民主专政，巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线，保卫胜利果实；第二，在以农业为基础、工业为主导的方针指导下，大力发展农牧业生产，开展群众性的爱国增产节约运动；第三，大力发展文化教育事业和开展爱国卫生运动。他勉励全体代表戒骄戒躁，永远记住毛主席的“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，继续发挥模范带头作用。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员帕巴拉·卓列朗杰、阿沛·阿旺晋美、西藏军区副司令员陈明义、副政治委员詹化雨和各机关、各人民团体的负责人都出席了大会的开幕式。
