Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, December 17th. The Cambodian radio station broadcast a commentary on the evening of the 16th, saying, "The warm reception of Prince Sihanouk by the Chinese people has deeply moved all Cambodians. We Cambodians understand how precious the friendship of the great country of People's China is. The Cambodian people know that in any situation, it can count on the friendship and support of great China, which is an extremely precious help to the Cambodian people."

The commentary said that although China has its own difficulties in guaranteeing the development of its own economy, "People's China has not hesitated to agree to give our country a large amount of generous assistance."

The commentary said that the four factories aided by China to Cambodia are an extremely valuable help to the Cambodian economy, and these factories ensure that these relevant production departments are largely independent. The powerful radio station donated by China enables Cambodia to provide constantly improved programs to its own country and the foreign public. At the same time, the continuous development of economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries brings great benefits to Cambodia.

The commentary said, "Finally, especially the extremely good relations between Beijing and Phnom Penh show that as long as there is a real willingness, two countries with completely different social structures and systems can establish such harmonious and fruitful relations."

*Mien Hua Daily* today published the talks given by some Cambodian congressmen to the newspaper reporters on Prince Sihanouk's third official visit to China.

Congressman Pi Tianlie, who led a Cambodian cultural delegation to China last year, said, "We Cambodians are very happy to know that the Chinese people have given such a warm welcome to Prince Sihanouk, the head of state of Cambodia. We fully agree with Prince Sihanouk's visit to China, because this visit will further enhance the friendship between our two countries."

Congressman Yu Nan said that Prince Sihanouk's visit to socialist countries was successful, and it will further enhance Cambodia's friendship with socialist countries. He said, "This friendship is very precious. With this friendship and Prince Sihanouk's leadership, Cambodia's independence will be more consolidated, and its neutral policy will be firmer."

Congressman Xie Weng, who had visited China, told reporters that Prince Sihanouk's third visit to China showed that "the friendship between Cambodia and China has entered a stage of relatives and brothers, which is gratifying." He said that every Cambodian is happy about the success of Prince Sihanouk's visit.
