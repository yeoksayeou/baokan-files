    Protest Against the Brutal Crimes of U.S. Imperialism in the Congo
    By a Commentator of This Newspaper
    Another serious incident has occurred in the Congo. The Mobutu rebel group, with the support of U.S. imperialism and the "United Nations forces" under its control, brazenly kidnapped Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba. It is reported that Prime Minister Lumumba is not only being imprisoned by the rebel group, but is also being subjected to all kinds of humiliation and beatings by the rebels, and his life is in danger. This atrocity of persecuting Prime Minister Lumumba is arousing great indignation among the broad patriotic people of the Congo and just public opinion in various countries around the world.
    After the kidnapping, the United Nations authorities in the Congo immediately issued a communique stating that "the United Nations is not responsible for Lumumba's actions," attempting to completely shirk the United Nations' responsibility for this incident. However, the United Nations cannot escape its guilt for instigating the rebel group to persecute Prime Minister Lumumba. The "United Nations forces" manipulated by U.S. imperialism have colluded with the Mobutu rebel group, taking a series of measures to weaken and even completely subvert the legitimate Congolese government headed by Prime Minister Lumumba. The United Nations authorities have supported in many ways the military rebellion launched by the Congolese traitor Mobutu, and a spokesman for the "United Nations forces" stated that the United Nations would abandon the legitimate Congolese government and associate with the Mobutu rebel group. The commander of the "United Nations forces" in Leopoldville even attended a so-called military "review" by the Mobutu rebel group, intimidating the Congolese people. More seriously, while the "United Nations forces" condoned the rebel group's arrest and persecution of responsible officials of the Congolese central government and Congolese patriots in the Congolese capital, they publicly placed Prime Minister Lumumba under house arrest in the name of "protection," actually depriving Prime Minister Lumumba of his personal freedom long ago. Prior to the aforementioned atrocities, the "United Nations forces" had openly stated that they would prevent Prime Minister Lumumba from leaving Leopoldville to go to his hometown in Orientale Province, and since Prime Minister Lumumba left Leopoldville on the 27th of last month, the United Nations authorities and the Mobutu group have been extremely "alarmed." Now that the Mobutu rebel group has kidnapped Lumumba, is not the United Nations authorities' so-called "non-interference" statement blatantly supporting and encouraging the Mobutu rebel group's persecution of Lumumba? It is very clear that the "United Nations forces" headquarters is actually an accomplice in this despicable atrocity of persecuting Prime Minister Lumumba.
    It must be pointed out that standing behind the Mobutu rebel group and the "United Nations forces" headquarters, plotting the sinister conspiracy to persecute Lumumba, are the American imperialists. It is not difficult for people to understand that the persecution of Lumumba occurred after the United States manipulated the United Nations General Assembly and directed the ugly farce of depriving Lumumba's legitimate government of its representation in the United Nations, and this is by no means accidental. The Wall Street propaganda machine, the *New York Herald Tribune*, published an editorial on November 26, viciously scolding Prime Minister Lumumba as a "rabble-rousing politician," and already clamoring murderously for "tough action" to be taken in the Congo to "prevent" Lumumba from "returning to power." This incident of persecuting Prime Minister Lumumba is a major conspiratorial step by U.S. imperialism to strangle Congolese independence, subvert the legitimate Congolese government, and then replace it with a Wall Street puppet regime.
    U.S. imperialists and their lackeys in the Congo are now gloating over the success of their conspiracy to kidnap Prime Minister Lumumba. However, the patriotic and just struggle of the Congolese people can never be strangled by U.S. imperialism and its agents in the Congo. On the contrary, the barbaric acts of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in persecuting the Lumumba government can only arouse greater anger among the Congolese people. On December 4, even in the Congolese capital of Leopoldville, which is under the strict control of the rebel group and the "United Nations forces," mass demonstrations in support of Prime Minister Lumumba broke out, which is a powerful answer from the Congolese people to the atrocities of U.S. imperialism. As a commentary broadcast by Radio Guinea on December 2 pointed out, "It is certain that the humiliation of Lumumba, who is striving to prevent the Congo from becoming an imperialist colony, will generate a violent reaction among the Congolese people."
    The Congolese people will not allow, the people of African countries will not allow, and all peace-loving people in the world will not allow U.S. imperialism to persecute Lumumba through the hands of the United Nations and Congolese national traitors! The Chinese people, together with the people of all countries in the world, angrily condemn and protest this serious crime committed by U.S. imperialism in the Congo through the United Nations. The Chinese people resolutely support the legitimate Congolese government headed by Prime Minister Lumumba and resolutely support the patriotic and just struggle of the Congolese people. We appeal to all upright people in the world to take immediate action to stop the black hand of U.S. imperialism persecuting Lumumba. Prime Minister Lumumba's freedom must be restored immediately!

    抗议美帝国主义在刚果的野蛮罪行
    本报评论员
    刚果发生了又一严重事件。蒙博托叛乱集团在美帝国主义及其操纵下的“联合国军”的支持下，悍然绑架刚果总理卢蒙巴。据报道，卢蒙巴总理目前不仅遭到了叛乱集团的监禁，而且还遭到了叛乱分子的百般凌辱和毒打，并有生命的危险。迫害卢蒙巴总理的这一暴行，正在激起刚果广大的爱国人民和世界各国公正舆论的巨大的愤慨。
    绑架事件发生以后，在刚果的联合国当局立即发表公报说，“联合国对卢蒙巴的行动不负任何责任”，妄图把联合国对这一事件的责任推卸得一干二净。但是，联合国是不可能逃脱其策动叛乱集团迫害卢蒙巴总理的罪责的。美帝国主义操纵下的“联合国军”同蒙博托叛乱集团狼狈为奸，曾经采取了一系列措施，力图削弱以至完全颠复以卢蒙巴总理为首的刚果合法政府。联合国当局多方支持了刚果卖国分子蒙博托发动的军事叛乱，“联合国军”发言人声言，联合国将摒弃刚果合法政府而同蒙博托叛乱集团来往。“联合国军”的指挥官在利奥波德维尔甚至还出席了蒙博托叛乱集团恫吓刚果人民的所谓军事“检阅”。更为严重的是，“联合国军”一面纵容叛乱集团在刚果首都逮捕和迫害刚果中央政府的负责官员和刚果爱国者；一面又以“保护”为名，公开出面软禁了卢蒙巴总理，实际上早就剥夺了卢蒙巴总理的人身自由。在上述暴行发生以前，“联合国军”曾公然声称要阻止卢蒙巴总理离开利奥波德维尔到他的故乡东方省去的行动，而自从卢蒙巴总理在上月27日离开利奥波德维尔之后，联合国当局和蒙博托集团一样感到十分“惊慌”。现在当蒙博托叛乱集团绑架了卢蒙巴，联合国当局的所谓“不干涉”的声明，不就是明目张胆地在支持和鼓动蒙博托叛乱集团对卢蒙巴的迫害吗？事情十分明白，“联合国军”司令部实际上是这次迫害卢蒙巴总理的卑鄙暴行的共谋者。
    必须指出，站在蒙博托叛乱集团和“联合国军”司令部背后，策划迫害卢蒙巴的罪恶阴谋的，是美国帝国主义者。人们不难理解，对卢蒙巴的迫害，发生在美国操纵联合国大会，导演了剥夺卢蒙巴合法政府在联合国的代表权的一场丑剧之后，这绝不是偶然的。华尔街的宣传机器《纽约先驱论坛报》在11月26日发表的社论中恶毒地谩骂卢蒙巴总理为“煽惑人心的政客”，并且已经杀气腾腾地叫嚷要在刚果“采取强硬行动”，“阻止”卢蒙巴“重新执政”。这次迫害卢蒙巴总理的事件，正是美帝国主义绞杀刚果独立，颠复刚果合法政府，并进而代之以华尔街傀儡政权的一个重大的阴谋步骤。
    美帝国主义者及其在刚果的走狗，现在因为绑架卢蒙巴总理的阴谋得逞而得意忘形起来。但是，刚果人民的爱国正义斗争，绝不是美帝国主义及其在刚果的代理人所能扼杀得了的。正相反，美帝国主义及其走狗迫害卢蒙巴政府的野蛮行为，只能激起刚果人民的更大的愤怒。12月4日，即使是在叛乱集团和“联合国军”严密控制下的刚果首都利奥波德维尔，也爆发了支持卢蒙巴总理的群众示威，这就是刚果人民对于美帝国主义暴行的一个有力的回答。正如几内亚电台12月2日发表的评论所指出的，“可以肯定，对竭力反对使刚果沦为帝国主义殖民地的卢蒙巴实行侮辱，将会在刚果人民中产生猛烈的反应。”
    刚果人民不容许，非洲各国人民不容许，全世界一切爱好和平的人民不容许美帝国主义假联合国和刚果民族叛徒之手迫害卢蒙巴！中国人民和全世界各国人民一道，愤怒地谴责和抗议美帝国主义利用联合国在刚果犯下的这一严重的罪行。中国人民坚决支持以卢蒙巴总理为首的刚果合法政府，坚决支持刚果人民的爱国正义斗争。我们向全世界一切正直的人们呼吁，立即采取行动，制止美帝国主义迫害卢蒙巴的黑手。必须立即恢复卢蒙巴总理的自由！
