Accumulating Fertilizer Locally Saves Labor; Reducing Soil Mixing Improves Quality; Accumulate Fertilizer Regularly and Launch Concentrated Campaigns
    Improving Fertilizer Accumulation Methods Requires Less Labor and Produces More Fertilizer
    Hongxing Team One Accumulates Sufficient Base Fertilizer for Next Year, Quality Doubles, Labor Saved by Half
    Jupuo Commune Jianfeng Production Team Starts Early and Plans Skillfully, Preparing Sufficient Fertilizer for Crops

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Party Branch of the First Production Team of the Hongxing Brigade, Xiaoba Commune, Qingtongxia, Ningxia, through extensive discussions with members, reformed unreasonable fertilizer accumulation methods, achieving less labor and better fertilizer. In the five months since June, they have accumulated enough base fertilizer for the entire next year, and the fertilizer quality has more than doubled compared to previous years. All of these fertilizers have been stored in the fields. Due to the improvement of fertilizer accumulation methods, this year's fertilizer accumulation and transportation saved more than half the labor compared to previous years.
    The First Production Team of the Hongxing Brigade has always started fertilizer accumulation work early. Every year, after applying sufficient base fertilizer to the summer-sown crops of the current year, they begin accumulating fertilizer for the next year. In June this year, after the summer sowing ended, the Party Branch launched a discussion on fertilizer work among the members, presenting the following account: Every year, the labor used for accumulating, making, and transporting fertilizer accounts for about 35% of the total workdays for the entire team. For example, for wheat, each mu is contracted for twelve to fifteen workdays, but the fertilizer transportation alone (excluding animal power) requires an average of three workdays per mu for fields both near and far. Adding the labor for accumulating and making fertilizer, fertilizer alone requires about five workdays per mu, accounting for one-third of the contracted workdays. Thus, only seven to ten workdays are left for other aspects of each mu of wheat, such as leveling the land, preparing the soil, sowing, topdressing, weeding, and harvesting, which is clearly insufficient. How can we reduce the labor on fertilizer accumulation? The Party Branch called on members to use their brains and find solutions. Through extensive and in-depth discussions among the members, a solution was finally found.
    The members proposed: First, implement animal pens in the fields to accumulate fertilizer locally. In the past, whether for lining toilets or pens, soil was first transported from the fields to the homes. After lining, it was removed and piled up in the villages, and then transported from the villages to the fields during sowing, wasting half the labor on transportation. If we implement animal pens in the fields and pile fertilizer in the fields, use soil nearby, and compost manure on the spot, we can save three-quarters of the transportation labor. Second, improve fertilizer quality. Since communization, the First Production Team has overcome the phenomenon of "moving yellow soil." If the current soil mixing ratio of one cart of manure to two carts of soil and one cart of pure manure to four carts of soil is reduced by half, more than one-third of the labor force can be saved. Third, properly arrange the labor force and seize the opportunity for fertilizer accumulation. In the past, regular fertilizer accumulation and seasonal fertilizer accumulation were not accurately grasped. There were too few laborers during the fertilizer accumulation season, and the opportunity to accumulate fertilizer was lost; there was surplus labor during the off-season, resulting in waste. If fertilizer is not properly managed during the peak season, the quality of fertilizer will be poor and labor will be more intensive when it is rushed in the off-season.
    The Party Branch adopted these suggestions from the members and immediately took action. In just one week, it moved all forty-two large livestock of the entire team in two pens to the yellow soil fields suitable for applying pen manure, and moved all the pigsties of the team to the sandy loam fields suitable for applying pig manure. In this way, we can achieve accumulation, transportation, and piling and sealing as needed, which saves labor and improves fertilizer efficiency. The Party Branch also reorganized the fertilizer accumulation organization and established a fertilizer accumulation team. The fertilizer accumulation team must not only manage the year-round fertilizer accumulation, ensuring that all sources of fertilizer, large and small, in the team are not lost, but also accurately grasp seasonal fertilizer accumulation, understand the ways of seasonal fertilizer accumulation and the number of labor required, and make suggestions. Under the direct participation and guidance of experienced farmers, in addition to grasping the year-round sources of fertilizer, such as accumulating pen manure and collecting miscellaneous manure, they also divided the seasons into three stages: From June to October is the peak season for collecting green grass, composting weeds, and planting green manure; November to January is an important season for burning kang fertilizer, pulling sheep manure, digging peat, and making soil fertilizer; from February to May, there are not many sources of fertilizer, and agricultural work is busy. Therefore, in addition to keeping three to five people to insist on accumulating pen manure and sweeping up miscellaneous manure, all other personnel participate in field operations.
    After more than five months of efforts, the First Production Team of the Hongxing Brigade has already composted and sealed all the base fertilizer on the 891 mu of its 980 mu of summer and autumn fields for next year, except for the 89 mu that have been planted with green manure. This saves two-thirds of the labor used in previous fertilizer transportation. Due to the reform of fertilizer accumulation methods, the fertilizer labor cost is about half of what it was in previous years. Calculated at 2.5 workdays saved per mu, 2,225 workdays can be saved on fertilizer work next year, strengthening field operations.

    (Reported by this newspaper, Wuhan, 1st) The Jianfeng Production Team of the Zhupo Commune, Xiangyang County, Hubei Province, has adopted the method of starting early and arranging skillfully to vigorously accumulate and make fertilizer, preparing sufficient fertilizer for crops. Now, this production team's 2,006 mu of autumn-sown crops, in addition to having sufficient base fertilizer applied to each mu, has also prepared more than 140,000 dan of high-quality fertilizer, enough for two topdressings before the new year.
    The Jianfeng Team has done a good job in accumulating fertilizer with great achievements. The most important key is to start early and arrange skillfully. Before autumn sowing this year, under the leadership of the Party Branch, this team conscientiously summarized the experience of increasing production over the years and proposed that the word "early" should be the priority in fertilizer application, grasping the next season in the current season and grasping next year in the current year. It specifically required each team to prepare 100 dan of topdressing fertilizer for each mu of autumn-sown crops before autumn sowing.
    While grasping "early," this team also paid special attention to the skillful arrangement of fertilizer accumulation work, achieving a combination of fixed professionals and everyone's participation, a combination of concentrated fertilizer accumulation and regular fertilizer accumulation, a combination of collective fertilizer accumulation and family fertilizer accumulation, and a combination of fertilizer accumulation and fertilizer making. This team fixed a deputy captain from the production team to each team to take charge of fertilizer. The entire team organized thirty-six experienced elderly members into fifteen groups to specialize in fertilizer accumulation throughout the year. At the same time, it mobilized the masses to participate, everyone acting, accumulating fertilizer when they have time, and grabbing fertilizer when they see it. The team has more than 1,100 members, accumulating more than 30,000 dan of fertilizer every month without affecting production. This team also seized the production gap according to the season to carry out concentrated fertilizer accumulation. This year, they carried out four concentrated fertilizer accumulation campaigns. At the same time, this team also grasped the basic construction of fertilizer accumulation. The entire team built more than 50 large manure pools in the fields, averaging one for every 40 mu of land. All 216 draught cattle have cowsheds, and more than 4,000 dan of cowshed manure can be accumulated every month. In the fifteen large pigsties, there is a large manure pool of more than 2,000 dan, and more than 10,000 dan of liquid fertilizer can be made every month. Each member's home also has chicken coops, toilets, urinal pools and small manure piles.

    就地积肥节省劳力　少掺杂土提高质量　常年积肥分期突击
    改进积肥方法用工少肥料多
    红星一队积足明年底肥，质量提高一倍，节约劳力一半
    朱坡公社建锋生产队早动手巧安排已为农作物备足肥料
    本报讯　宁夏青铜峡小坝公社红星大队第一生产小队党支部，通过社员广泛讨论，改革了不合理的积肥方法，做到了少用工、积好肥。从6月份以来的五个多月中，已积足明年全年所需底肥，肥料质量比往年提高一倍以上。这些肥料已全部压存在田头。由于改进了积肥方法，今年的积肥运肥比往年节省了一半以上的劳力。
    红星大队第一生产小队的积肥工作，年年抓得早。每年都是在当年的夏播作物送足底肥以后，就开始积攒下一年的肥料。今年6月间，夏播一结束，党支部发动群众讨论肥料工作的时候，向社员算了这么一笔帐：每年全小队用于积、造、运肥的劳力占全年总包工数的35％左右。比如小麦，每亩包十二个至十五个工，但每年仅运肥一项（不算畜力），远近田平均每亩就要花三个工，再加上积、造肥料的工，光肥料一项，每亩就要用五个左右，占包工的三分之一。这样，每亩小麦其他方面的用工，如平田整地，播种，追肥，薅草，直到黄熟收割，总共只能用七到十个工，显然不能满足需要。怎样才能减少积肥上的用工呢？党支部号召社员动脑筋，想办法。经过社员的广泛深入讨论，终于找到了办法。
    社员们提出：第一，实行畜圈下地，就地积肥。过去不论垫厕所或垫圈，都是先从田里拉土回家，垫好后起出来堆放在庄子里，到播种时再从庄子里拉运到田头，往返白费一半工。如果实行畜圈下地，田头堆肥，就近用土，就地压粪，就能节约四分之三的拉运劳力。第二，提高肥料质量。从公社化以来，第一生产小队已经克服了“黄土搬家”的现象。如果将现在一车圈粪两车土和一车纯粪四车土的掺土比例，再减少一半，就能节约三分之一以上的劳动力。第三，要妥善安排劳力，切实抓住积肥时机。过去常年积肥和季节积肥没有抓准、抓狠，积肥旺季劳力嫌少，失去了积肥时机；积肥淡季劳力有余，造成浪费。旺季肥料不抓好，到淡季再去突击，肥料质量就差，用工也多。
    党支部采纳了社员们的这些建议，马上行动起来，仅用一个星期时间，就把全小队四十二头大家畜分两个圈，迁移到适合上圈粪的黄土地的田头，把全队猪圈迁移到适合上猪肥的夹沙地的田头。这样就做到了随积、随运、随堆压封闭，既节约了劳力，又提高了肥效。党支部还整顿了积肥组织，建立起一个积肥小组。积肥小组不但要管好常年积肥，使全队大小肥源不流失，还要抓准季节积肥，摸清季节积肥门路和需工数量，提出建议。他们在老农直接参加和指导下，除抓常年肥源，如积圈肥、拾杂粪外，还按季节划分了三个段落：从6月到10月是大打青草、沤杂草、种绿肥的旺季；11月到1月为烧炕肥、拉羊粪、挖草炭、造土化肥的重要季节；2月到5月肥源不多，农活正忙，因此积肥小组除留三至五人坚持积圈肥、扫拾杂粪外，其他人员全部参加田间作业。
    经过五个多月的努力，红星大队第一生产小队明年的九百八十亩夏田和秋田，除八十九亩已种上绿肥外，其余八百九十一亩的田头，都已经压封好全部底肥，比以往运肥用工数节约了三分之二。由于改革了积肥方法，肥料工本约为往年的一半左右。以每亩节约二点五个工计算，明年在肥料工作上就能节约出二千二百二十五个工日，加强田间作业。
    本报武汉1日电　湖北省襄阳县朱坡公社建锋生产队，采取早动手、巧安排的办法，大抓积肥造肥，为农作物准备了充足的肥料。现在，这个生产队的二千零六亩秋播作物，除每亩已施足了底肥以外，又准备了十四万多担质量很好的足够年前施两次追肥的肥料。
    建锋队积肥工作抓得好、成绩大，最主要的关键是早动手、巧安排。今年秋播以前，这个队在党支部领导下，认真总结了历年增产经验，提出了抓肥也要以“早”字当先，在上季就抓下季，在今年就抓明年，并具体要求各小队在秋播前为每亩秋播作物准备一百担追肥。
    在抓“早”的同时，这个队还特别注意了积肥工作的巧安排，做到了固定专业和人人动手相结合，突击积肥和经常积肥相结合、集体积肥和家庭积肥相结合、积肥和造肥相结合。这个队，从生产队到各个小队都固定一个副队长专管肥料，全队组织三十六个有经验的老年社员，分成十五个小组，一年四季专搞积肥。同时还发动群众，人人动手，有空就积，见肥就抓。全队一千一百多个社员，每月在不影响生产的前提下，就积肥三万多担。这个队还根据季节，抓住生产间隙，大搞突击积肥。今年他们就搞了四次突击积肥。同时，这个队还抓紧了积肥基本建设，全队在地头修建了五十多个大粪池，平均四十亩地有一个。二百一十六头耕牛都有牛栏，每月可积牛栏粪四千多担。十五个大猪圈里，都有一个两千担以上的大粪池，每月可造水粪一万多担。每户社员家里，也都有鸡笼、厕所、小便池子和小粪堆等。
