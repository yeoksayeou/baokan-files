Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, December 6th: West German Foreign Minister Brentano today announced the West German government's response to the United States' pressure on it to help resolve the dollar crisis, putting forward a five-point plan that the West German government is prepared to undertake. However, he reiterated that the West German government is unwilling to pay for the expenses of American troops stationed in West Germany, as requested by the United States.

The five-point plan that Brentano mentioned at the Christian Democratic Union parliamentary group meeting is: immediately repaying the six hundred million U.S. dollars in war debt owed by West Germany ahead of schedule, increasing imports of surplus American agricultural products, purchasing more American military equipment, increasing West Germany's burden on NATO military expenses, and providing some "aid" to underdeveloped countries.

It is reported that these things mentioned by Brentano are what West Germany agreed to during negotiations with U.S. Treasury Secretary Anderson and others, and there has been no further retreat from West Germany's position in that negotiation. He did not specify whether West Germany's early repayment of debt owed to the United States was conditional on the United States returning Hitler Germany's property in the United States that was confiscated during World War II. In the past, West German newspapers have always revealed that West Germany was making this a condition. Regarding the expenses for expanding "aid" to underdeveloped countries, he did not specify whether this money would be handed over to institutions such as the "International Development Association" controlled by the United States. West German Vice-Chancellor and Minister of Economic Affairs Erhard recently stated that West Germany should deal directly with underdeveloped countries as much as possible, so that West Germany's money can serve the interests of the West German ruling group, without "intermediate intervention" from international institutions controlled by the United States.

Brentano confirmed that two representatives from the U.S. Department of Defense are in Bonn negotiating with West Germany on the issue of increasing purchases of American military equipment. He did not specify what agreement was reached between the two sides.

As for the two items of increasing purchases of surplus American agricultural products and increasing West Germany's burden on NATO expenses, it is revealed that the required funds are not large.

    美国一再逼迫　西德硬不买账
    勃伦塔诺宣布“五点计划”
    坚持原来立场拒绝负担美国驻军费用
    新华社波恩6日电　西德外长勃伦塔诺今天宣布了西德政府对美国逼迫它帮助解救美元危机的答复，提出了西德政府准备做的五点计划。但是他重申西德政府不愿意像美国所要求的那样支付驻西德美军费用。
    勃伦塔诺在基督教民主联盟议会党团会议上谈到的五点计划是：立刻提前归还战后西德欠美国的六亿美元债款，增加美国剩余农产品的进口，购买美国更多的军火，增加西德对北大西洋集团军事费用的负担，西德给予不发达国家若干“援助”。
    据报道，勃伦塔诺提到的这些就是西德在同美国财政部长安德逊等谈判时答应了的东西，并没有从西德在那次谈判中的立场再退让一步。他没有说明西德提前归还欠美国的债款，是否以美国归还二次大战期间没收的希特勒德国在美国的财产为条件。而西德报纸过去一直透露西德是以此为条件的。关于对不发达国家进行扩张的“援助”费用，他也没有说明是否把这些钱交给美国控制下的“国际开发协会”之类的机构。而西德副总理兼经济部长艾哈德最近表明过，西德要尽可能直接同不发达国家打交道，以使西德的钱为西德统治集团的利益服务，而不受美国控制的国际机构的“中间干预”。
    勃伦塔诺证实，美国国防部的两个代表正在波恩同西德就增加购买美国军火问题进行谈判。他没有说明双方达成了什么协议。
    至于增加购买美国剩余农产品和增加西德对北大西洋集团费用的负担两项，据透露所需款项为数不大。
