Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 12th: The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" today published an editorial on the "Appeal to the Peoples of the World" by the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries. The title of the editorial is: "The Historical Mission of Communists."

The editorial stated that an extremely deep concern for the welfare and prosperity of mankind permeates the words of the statement and the "Appeal to the Peoples of the World" by the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries. These two documents are permeated with one idea: that all efforts must be made to realize the wishes of the peoples of all countries for generations, namely, to live in conditions of peace and freedom.

The editorial stated that the statement and the "Appeal to the Peoples of the World" by the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries pointed out with irrefutable facts where the threat to the cause of peace comes from. American imperialism, which embodies the ideology of the belligerent reactionaries in its policies, is the main force of war and aggression. It uses aggressive military blocs and a network of bases to bind the various capitalist countries subordinate to it. It has launched an unprecedented arms race in history and is desperately resisting the cause of disarmament. It colludes with West German militarism to rebuild a hotbed of war danger in the center of Europe. It violates the will of the Japanese people and turns Japan into a springboard for a new war. It threatens the Cuban revolution, attempts to reverse the historical development of the African people, and shamelessly interferes in the affairs of the peoples of Latin America and the Near East.

The editorial continued, however, the time when imperialists could do whatever they wanted to decide whether a war would happen has passed. What determines the development of international relations in the current era is not imperialism, but the struggle between the two social systems, the struggle of socialism, peace, and democratic forces against imperialism, reactionaries, and aggressive forces. In our era, war is not inevitable, war can be prevented, and peace can be defended and consolidated.

The editorial emphasized that, however, peace will not come automatically. The task lies in fully and thoroughly utilizing the great possibilities for preventing war and maintaining peace opened up by the current configuration of international forces. The representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries have pointed out to the peoples of all countries the way to solve this most important problem of our time.

The Communist statement: "Now, for all democratic and peace-loving forces, there is no more urgent task than to save mankind from a world thermonuclear catastrophe. The unprecedented destructiveness of modern military technology urgently demands that the main actions of all anti-war and peace-loving forces be focused on preventing war. The struggle against war cannot be postponed until the outbreak of war, because then it will be too late to fight for many regions of the world and their inhabitants. Do not wait until atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs fall before launching a struggle against the danger of a new world war. This struggle must be carried out now, and it must be carried out more vigorously day by day. The main thing is to subdue the aggressors in time, prevent war, and not let it break out."

The editorial said that the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries emphasized that in the history of mankind, there has never been such a realistic possibility as in our era to achieve this goal. For the first time, there are great organized forces fighting against war. These forces are: the powerful Soviet Union, the entire socialist camp serving the cause of peace with its powerful material and political strength; the peace-loving countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America; the international working class and its various organizations, especially the Communist Party; the national liberation movements of the peoples of colonies and dependent countries; the world movement for peace; neutral countries advocating peaceful coexistence. Part of the bourgeoisie in developed capitalist countries, who soberly estimate the balance of power and the dire consequences of modern war, also express their support for the policy of peaceful coexistence.

The editorial emphasized that if all the powerful peace-loving forces unite closely, and if they unite and act actively, then the imperialist aggressors will not be able to realize their man-hating conspiracies. The call made by the Communists to all good people is precisely to unite the peace-loving forces that can crush the evil war plans, defend peace, and consolidate friendship among the peoples of all countries. The editorial pointed out that the interests of maintaining world peace urgently require the establishment of a common and broadest united front against imperialist aggression and war policies. Life has proven that the united and active actions of all peace-loving forces can stop any military provocation by the imperialist aggressors. In recent years, the imperialists have launched local wars more than once, placing mankind on the brink of world devastation. But each time they have been defeated, resolutely countered by the Soviet Union, the socialist countries, and all peace-loving peoples.

However, the editorial emphasized, the enemies of peace are still powerful, cunning, and dangerous. The primary condition for stopping their conspiracies is the greatest vigilance of the people of all countries. The editorial said that today, to fight for peace means to tirelessly expose the policies of imperialism, to vigilantly watch the conspiracies of war instigators, to arouse the sacred anger of the people of the world against those who adhere to the war policy, to improve the organization of all peace-loving forces, and to continuously strengthen the active actions of the masses in defending peace.

The editorial said that the statement and the "Appeal to the Peoples of the World" by the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries is a comprehensive program that resolutely and purposefully struggles to prevent the danger of war. In contrast to the imperialist policy of predatory war, the Communists consistently and consistently adhere to the Leninist principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. The policy of peaceful coexistence actively promotes the health of the world situation, eases international tensions, and improves conditions for eliminating the "Cold War" and stopping the arms race. The Communists believe that their obligation is to greatly enhance the confidence of the masses in the possibility of consolidating peaceful coexistence. Like the 1957 Declaration and the Peace Manifesto, the statement and the "Appeal to the Peoples of the World" emphasize that the Communist Party considers the struggle for peace its primary task.

The editorial emphasized that if the imperialist madmen launch a war, the people of the world will eliminate and bury capitalism. This warning is a beneficial cold shower for those groups in the "Atlantic" camp who gamble with the fate of millions of people.

The editorial concluded that the international workers' movement, relying on the growing support of the broadest masses of the people, has now become such a powerful force that its communist vanguard can declare that saving our generation from the tragedy of a new war is its historical mission. This task can be accomplished, and it must be accomplished—the Communists will contribute all their strength to this great and sacred cause.

Peace will surely triumph over war!

    共产党人的历史使命
    苏联“真理报”十二月十二日社论摘要
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科12日讯：苏联《真理报》今天就各国共产党和工人党代表会议的告世界人民书发表了一篇社论，社论的题目是：《共产党人的历史使命》。
    社论说，对人类福利和繁荣的极为深切的关怀，渗透在各国共产党和工人党代表的声明和告世界人民书的字里行间。这两个文件贯穿着一个思想：必须尽一切努力，使各国人民世世代代的愿望，即生活在和平和自由的条件下的愿望，得以实现。
    社论说，各国共产党和工人党代表的声明和告世界人民书，以不可辩驳的事实指出了对和平事业的威胁来自何处。在政策中体现了好战的反动派的意识形态的美国帝国主义，是战争和侵略的主要力量。它用侵略性军事集团和基地网束缚住从属于它的各个资本主义国家。它发动了历史上空前未有的军备竞赛，并且对裁军事业进行拼命的抵抗。它同西德军国主义勾结，重建在欧洲中心的战争危险的策源地。它违背日本人民的意志，变日本为新战争的跳板。它威胁古巴革命，企图倒转非洲人民的历史发展，无耻地干涉拉丁美洲和近东人民的事务。
    社论接着说，然而，问题在于，帝国主义者为所欲为地决定战争是否发生的时代已经过去了。决定现时代国际关系发展的，不是帝国主义，而是两个社会体系的斗争，是社会主义、和平和民主的力量对帝国主义、反动派和侵略力量的斗争。在我们的时代，战争不是不可避免的，战争是可以防止的，和平是可以保卫住和巩固起来的。
    社论强调说，但是，和平是不会自行到来的。任务在于，把现在国际力量配置所开辟的防止战争和维护和平的巨大可能性，加以完全和彻底的利用。各国共产党和工人党代表会议向各国人民指出了解决当代这一最重要问题的道路。
    共产党人声明：“现在，对于所有民主和爱好和平的力量来说，再没有比使人类免遭世界热核灾难更迫切的任务了。现代军事技术的空前破坏性，迫切地要求把所有反对战争，爱好和平的力量的主要行动集中于防止战争。不能把反对战争的斗争拖延到战争爆发的时候，因为，那时对于世界许多地区和那里的居民来说，进行斗争将会是太迟了。不要等到落原子弹和氢弹的时候，才展开反对新的世界战争危险的斗争。现在就应当进行这一斗争，并且要一天比一天更加努力。主要的是及时制服侵略者，防止战争，不使它爆发”。
    社论说，各国共产党和工人党代表会议强调指出，在人类历史中，从来没有过像在我们时代里那样的现实的可能性来达到这一目的。第一次有了伟大的有组织的力量在进行着反对战争的斗争，这些力量是：强大的苏联，用自己的强大的物质力量和政治力量服务于和平事业的整个社会主义阵营；亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的爱好和平的国家；国际工人阶级和它的各种组织，首先是共产党；殖民地和附属国人民的民族解放运动；争取和平的世界运动；主张和平共处的中立国家。发达的资本主义国家中清醒地估计力量对比和现代战争惨重后果的一部分资产阶级，也表示赞成和平共处政策。
    社论强调说，如果一切强大的爱好和平力量紧密团结起来，如果它们联合和积极地行动，那么，帝国主义侵略者是无法实现他们仇恨人类的阴谋的。共产党人向所有善良的人们发出的呼吁，正是要求能够粉碎罪恶的战争计划、保卫住和平并巩固各国人民之间的友谊的爱好和平的力量团结起来。社论指出，维护世界和平的利益，迫切要求建立反对帝国主义侵略和战争政策的共同的最广泛的斗争战线。生活证明，一切爱好和平的力量联合和积极的行动，能够制止帝国主义侵略者的任何军事挑衅。近几年来，帝国主义者不止一次地发动局部战争，把人类置于世界浩劫的边缘。但是，他们每次都遭到了失败，遭到苏联、社会主义国家和所有爱好和平的人民的坚决反击。
    但是，社论着重指出，和平的敌人还是强大、狡猾和危险的。制止他们的阴谋诡计的首要条件，是各国人民最大的警惕性。社论说，今天，为和平而斗争，就是不倦地揭露帝国主义的政策，警觉地注视战争挑拨者的阴谋诡计，唤起世界人民对那些坚持战争方针的人的神圣愤怒，提高一切爱好和平力量的组织性，不断加强群众保卫和平的积极行动。
    社论说，各国共产党和工人党代表的声明和告世界人民书，是那样坚决地、目的明确地为防止战争危险而斗争的全面纲领。与帝国主义掠夺战争政策相反，共产党人一致地、始终如一地坚持不同社会制度国家和平共处的列宁主义原则。和平共处方针积极地促进世界局势健康化，缓和国际紧张局势，为消除“冷战”，和停止军备竞赛改善条件。共产党人认为自己的义务是，大力增强人民群众对巩固和平共处的可能性的信心。同1957年的宣言和和平宣言一样，声明和告世界人民书着重指出，共产党认为争取和平的斗争是自己的首要的任务。
    社论强调指出，如果帝国主义狂人发动战争，世界人民将清除和埋葬资本主义。对于“大西洋”营垒中的那些拿千百万人的命运来赌博的集团来讲，这一警告是一次有益的冷水浴。
    社论最后说，依靠最广泛的人民群众日益增长的支持的国际工人运动，现在变成了如此强大的力量，以致它的共产主义先锋队有可能宣布，拯救我们一代人免遭新战争惨祸是自己的历史使命。这一任务是能够完成的，它应当完成——共产党人将为这一伟大的神圣事业贡献出自己的一切力量。
    和平必将战胜战争！
