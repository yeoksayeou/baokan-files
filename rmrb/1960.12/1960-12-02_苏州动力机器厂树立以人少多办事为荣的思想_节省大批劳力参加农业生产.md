The Suzhou Power Machinery Plant in Jiangsu Province has established the idea of "taking pride in accomplishing more with fewer people" and launched a competition to "one person doing the work of several," greatly tapping the potential of labor. From January to October this year, the average number of employees in the plant decreased by 34.4% compared to the same period last year, while output and output value increased by 1.4 times and 1.17 times respectively. The labor productivity of all employees increased by 2.12 times, reaching the level of one person doing the work of three. A total of 144 people were transferred to reinforce the agricultural front and newly built or expanded key enterprises.

Since the beginning of this year, the plant's Party committee has conducted publicity and education among employees on the importance of agriculture as the foundation and running enterprises diligently and thriftily by organizing employees to visit rural areas and calculating detailed accounts of increasing production and practicing economy. They put forward the slogan "One person does the work of several, reduces personnel and increases production, saves labor, and wholeheartedly supports the countryside." The broad masses of employees actively responded to the Party's call, expressing that they would obey the needs of socialist construction in everything, providing products and people as needed. Starting in May, the Party committee further mobilized the masses to launch a competition for one person to do the work of several, with each workshop establishing models of one person doing the work of several, creating a heated atmosphere of catching up with, surpassing, and helping each other. In the competition, they insisted on mobilizing the masses to carry out technical revolution and improve production efficiency. Employees fiercely attacked backward manual operations and key production processes, multiplying work efficiency. In the machining workshop, manual tapping was originally used, requiring five or six people per shift, which still could not meet the requirements of the subsequent processes. Workers successfully developed a tapping machine, which increased work efficiency fivefold, requiring only two people per shift, immediately saving nine laborers. From January to October, the plant achieved more than 800 large and small innovations, saving 10,450 work hours, equivalent to the labor required to manufacture more than 250 diesel engines.

In order to tap more labor potential, the plant also reasonably adjusted labor organization, scientifically organized production, and made full use of manpower and equipment. For example, the machining of diesel engine parts was originally divided into two workshops for large and small parts, with many parts being processed across workshops, increasing scheduling difficulties and wasting manpower and time. After research, the plant leaders merged them into one machining workshop, implementing unified leadership and dividing work according to parts. After this adjustment, 30 laborers were freed up. After the foundry workshop implemented cross-operation between casting workers and unboxing workers, as well as division of labor according to "packages," the phenomenon of idling and waste was avoided. Although casting tasks continued to increase, the number of people decreased from 29 to 18. Each workshop also paired new and old workers in groups, with the old workers mastering key tasks and providing technical guidance to improve the technical level of new workers, so that the strengths of both new and old workers could be fully utilized. Plant leaders also adopted methods such as three checks a day and comprehensive inspections to organize balanced production, preventing any link from being broken and avoiding work stoppages and waiting for materials, thus making full use of working hours.

In addition, this plant also compressed non-production personnel on the basis of further mobilizing workers to participate in management. Each production team in the plant established a core group composed of the Party group leader, production team leader, and activists, and also selected "six major members" such as tool custodians, quality inspectors, statisticians, and welfare officers to rely on the masses to strengthen management, creating favorable conditions for reducing non-production personnel. The plant reduced 34 non-production personnel. Through these effective measures, the production efficiency of workers has generally improved, and many workers have achieved one doing the work of three or one doing the work of four. Due to the greatly improved labor productivity of all employees, the plant completed the year's more arduous diesel engine production tasks ahead of schedule, with fewer people than last year.

    苏州动力机器厂树立以人少多办事为荣的思想
    节省大批劳力参加农业生产
    本报讯　江苏省苏州动力机器厂职工，树立了“以人少多办事为荣”的思想，开展“一人顶几人”的竞赛，大挖劳动力潜力。今年1至10月份，全厂平均人数比去年同期减少34.4％，产量和产值分别增长一点四倍和一点一七倍，全员劳动生产率增长二点一二倍，达到一人顶三人，先后抽出一百四十四人充实农业战线和新建扩建的重点企业。
    这个厂的党委，今年以来，通过组织职工参观农村、算增产节约细账等方式，对职工进行了以农业为基础和勤俭办企业的宣传教育，提出了“一人顶几人，减人大增产，节约劳动力，全心支援农村”的口号。职工群众积极响应党的号召，纷纷表示：一切服从社会主义建设的需要，要产品有产品，要人有人。党委从5月份起，进一步发动群众，开展一人顶几人的竞赛，各个车间树立了一人顶几人的标兵，掀起了你追我赶、互赛互帮的热潮。在竞赛中，坚持发动群众大搞技术革命，提高生产效率。职工猛攻落后手工操作和生产关键，使工效成倍提高。机械加工车间原来用手工攻螺丝，每班用五、六个人做，还不能满足后道工序的要求，工人搞成功一台攻丝机，就使工效提高五倍，每班只用两人，一下节约了九个劳动力。全厂1到10月共实现大小革新八百多项，节约工时达一万零四百五十个，相等于制造二百五十多台柴油机的用工量。
    为了挖掘更多的劳动力潜力，这个厂还合理调整了劳动组织，科学组织生产，充分利用人力、设备。如柴油机部件金加工原来分大件、小件两个车间，部件跨车间加工的很多，增加调度上的困难，浪费人力和时间。厂领导研究后，便合并为一个机械加工车间，实行统一领导，按部件分工作业，经过这样调整，腾出了三十个劳动力。铸工车间实行浇铸工和开箱工交叉作业以及按“包子”分工后，避免了窝工浪费现象，铸件任务虽然不断增加，但人数从二十九人减少到十八人。各个车间还把新老工人搭配编组，由老工人掌握关键活和作技术指导，提高新工人技术水平，使新老工人力量都得到充分发挥。厂领导上还采用一日三抓、全面检查等办法，组织均衡生产，不让一个环节脱节，避免停工待料，充分利用工时。
    此外，这个厂还在进一步发动工人参加管理的基础上，压缩非生产人员。全厂各个生产小组，都由党小组长、生产组长和积极分子等建立核心小组，并且选出工具保管员、质量检验员、统计员、生活福利员等“六大员”，依靠群众加强管理，为减少非生产人员创造了有利条件，全厂减少了非生产人员三十四人。通过这些有力措施，工人生产效率普遍提高，许多工人实现了一顶三、一顶四。由于全厂职工劳动生产率大大提高，因此在减人的情况下，提前完成了比去年更加繁重的全年柴油机生产任务。
