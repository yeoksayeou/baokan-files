    The Great Leap Forward in Hulunbuir
    Li Zhenhua, First Secretary of the CPC Hulunbuir League Committee
    After three consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward, the industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry production in the Hulunbuir League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have achieved tremendous development. The total industrial output value has risen from 57.64% of the total industrial and agricultural output value in 1957 to 69.8% this year. Compared with 1957, the total grain output this year is expected to increase by 1.2 times, and timber production by 75.57%. The net increase of various livestock in the past three years is more than 700,000 head. Other tasks have also achieved great results. The development of all these undertakings has brought profound changes to the Hulunbuir League area.
    Hulunbuir League is an important timber production base in our country and also a large agricultural and animal husbandry production base in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. It is inhabited by 1.8 million diligent and brave people of more than ten nationalities, including Mongolian, Han, Daur, Ewenki, and Oroqen. The land here is fertile, the water source is abundant, the trees are forested, and the pasture is rich. It is a "treasure bowl" in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. However, before liberation, this rich and beautiful place became very desolate under the oppression of the reactionary rule, and the people of all ethnic groups lived in extreme poverty. After liberation, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the working people were liberated, and Hulunbuir truly prospered and developed. Especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, under the guidance of the Party's general line for socialist construction, Hulunbuir's socialist construction has entered a new historical period. Starting from this year, in the mass campaign of making steel by the whole people, people of all ethnic groups went all out, worked hard, and built many "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups," and constructed some small steel plants. Now six banners and cities can produce steel themselves. In the past three years, an average of 1.2 industrial enterprises in the entire league have been put into production every day. After the people's communes were established, both urban and rural people's communes established farm machinery repair and agricultural and sideline product processing plants. The development of these local industries and commune industries has powerfully supported national construction and agricultural and animal husbandry production.
    In 1958, after the people's communes were established in agricultural and pastoral areas, the people of all ethnic groups on the agricultural and animal husbandry production front in Hulunbuir League, holding high the three red banners of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, worked hard and diligently, launching mass movements for agricultural and animal husbandry production time and time again. In this production upsurge, the rural people's communes implemented the policy of both diversified and high-yield farming, continuously expanding the cultivated area, vigorously developing farmland water conservancy, and further changing the backwardness of agricultural production in Hulunbuir League. This year, the sowing area of grain crops in the entire league has been expanded by more than 10% compared with last year, and the irrigated area of farmland has reached 1.8 million mu. Judging from the total grain output, this year is still a bumper year, with an average of 2,000 jin of grain harvested per farmer. Under the guidance of the Party's idea that agriculture is the foundation, this year, farmers of all ethnic groups and the vast number of workers in state-owned farms and ranches have worked hard from early spring to late autumn, reclaiming more than 4.6 million mu of wasteland, which is equivalent to the total area of wasteland reclaimed in the past ten years, which has laid a good material foundation for obtaining greater agricultural harvests next year.
    Since the "one hundred mothers one hundred offspring" movement was launched at the end of last year, the herdsmen of all ethnic groups on the livestock breeding front have successfully raised more than 600,000 young animals this year. In the past three years, the net increase of various livestock has been 31.34%. Due to the high-speed growth of animal husbandry production, in the past three years, herdsmen of all ethnic groups have supported the country with a large number of draught animals and edible cattle and sheep, as well as a large amount of wool, fur, milk powder, cream, casein, and lactose. Especially after the people's communes were established in pastoral areas, the technical transformation of animal husbandry and various basic production facilities and feed production have developed rapidly. This year, the work of mowing grass in the people's communes in pastoral areas has basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization. Even remote nomadic areas have opened up grain and feed bases this year, so that the single pastoral economy in pastoral areas has rapidly developed into a diversified economy that combines breeding and farming, creating favorable conditions for the great development of animal husbandry in the future. With the care and help of the Party, the living conditions of the herdsmen of all ethnic groups who "live by water and grass" have been greatly changed. Relying on the superiority of the people's communes, they have established settlements, and most herders have built new houses and settled down. In the places where they have settled down, they have set up factories, built schools, some have cultivated land and raised pigs, and established health clinics, kindergartens, and canteens. This has rapidly changed the backwardness of the pastoral areas and enabled the minority peoples in the pastoral areas to live a more stable and happy life.
    The forest industry is an important production sector in the league's national economy. In the past three years, thanks to the hard work of forestry workers of all ethnic groups, tens of millions of cubic meters of timber have been felled for the country. Timber production in the first ten months of this year increased by 16.2% compared with the same period last year. With the rapid increase in timber production, workers have built railways and opened up highways in the dense forests, and transported large quantities of timber to places where the country needs it in a timely manner. In the days of the Great Leap Forward, forestry workers put forward the fighting slogan of "Let the Greater Khingan Mountains be evergreen forever," conscientiously implemented the policy of both logging and renewal, and nurtured and renewed large areas of forest land. At the same time, comprehensive utilization of timber was carried out, and a large number of new products such as wild fiberboard and plywood were produced. Now, under the leadership of the Party, workers of all ethnic groups in the Greater Khingan Mountains forest area are engaged in creative labor to build this place into a modern forest industrial base for the motherland.
    With the great development of production and construction, the material and cultural life of urban and rural people has also improved rapidly. Now, primary education has been popularized in cities, rural areas, pastoral areas, and forest areas, and many middle schools and secondary vocational schools have been built. Medical networks have been established in agricultural, pastoral, and forest areas. Especially in nomadic areas, due to the initial settlement of herders and the improvement of material and cultural life, the population is booming, and a new scene of "prosperity of both people and livestock" is emerging everywhere.
    In the three consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward, we have deeply realized that the leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of all our undertakings, and Mao Zedong Thought is the lighthouse illuminating our progress. The reason why Hulunbuir League has achieved such great achievements in various production and construction projects is precisely because Mao Zedong Thought has armed the people of all ethnic groups, and the three red banners have guided the people of all ethnic groups to advance. Now, when we look back on the past, look at the present, and look forward to the future, our hearts are filled with gratitude to our great Party and our beloved leader Chairman Mao, and filled with confidence in winning greater victories in the future. The people of all ethnic groups in the entire league, on the basis of the great victories already achieved, are holding high the three red banners, with everyone united, and are fighting bravely for the sustained leap forward of industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry production in 1961!

    跃进中的呼伦贝尔
    中共呼伦贝尔盟委员会第一书记  李振华
    经过连续三年的大跃进，内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔盟工农牧林业生产获得了巨大的发展。工业总产值，由1957年占工农牧业总产值的57.64％，今年上升到69.8％。与1957年相比，今年粮食总产量预计增长一点二倍，木材生产增长75.57％。三年净增各种牲畜七十多万头。其它各项工作也取得了很大的成绩，所有这些事业的发展，使呼伦贝尔盟地区的面貌，发生了深刻的变化。
    呼伦贝尔盟，是我国重要木材生产基地，也是内蒙古自治区较大的农牧业生产基地之一。居住着蒙、汉、达斡尔、鄂温克和鄂伦春等十多个民族的一百八十万勤劳勇敢的人民。这里土地肥沃，水源丰富，树木成林，牧场丰美，是内蒙古自治区的一个“聚宝盆”。然而解放前，这个富饶美丽的地方，在反动统治的压榨下，变得十分荒凉，各族人民过着极端贫困的生活。解放以后，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，劳动人民翻了身，呼伦贝尔才真正繁荣发展起来。特别自1958年大跃进以来，在党的社会主义建设总路线的照耀下，呼伦贝尔的社会主义建设事业，进入了一个崭新的历史时期。从这一年开始，在全民大办钢铁的运动中，各族人民鼓足干劲，艰苦奋斗，建立许多“小土群”、“小洋群”，兴建了一些小型钢铁厂。现在已有六个旗和市，自己能生产钢铁了。三年来，全盟平均每天就有一点二个工业企业投入生产。人民公社化以后，城乡人民公社都建立了农牧机具修配和农副产品加工厂。这些地方工业和公社工业的发展，有力地支援了国家建设和农牧业生产。
    1958年，农牧区人民公社化后，呼伦贝尔盟农牧业生产战线上的各族人民，高举总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗，发愤图强，埋头苦干，一次又一次掀起了农牧业生产的群众运动。在这个生产高潮里，农村人民公社贯彻执行了多种多收与高产多收并举的方针，不断扩大耕地面积，大兴农田水利，进一步改变了呼伦贝尔盟农业生产的落后面貌。今年全盟粮食作物播种面积比去年扩大10％以上，农田灌溉面积达到一百八十万亩。从粮食总产量看，今年仍然是个丰收年，平均每个农民能收获二千斤粮食。在党的农业是基础的思想指导下，今年各族农民和国营农牧场广大职工，艰苦奋斗，从初春奋战到秋末，新开垦了四百六十多万亩荒地，相当于过去十年开荒面积的总和，这就为明年获得农业的更大收成，打下了良好的物质基础。
    畜牧业战线上的各族牧民，从去年年底开展“百母百仔”运动以后，今年成活了六十多万头仔畜。过去三年中，各种牲畜净增31.34％。由于畜牧业生产的高速度增长，三年来各族牧民支援了国家大批耕畜和食用牛羊以及大量绒毛、皮张、乳粉、奶油、酪胶和乳糖。特别是牧区人民公社化以后，畜牧业的技术改造，各项生产基本建设，饲料生产都有迅速的发展。今年牧区人民公社的打搂草工作，基本上实现了机械化和半机械化。连偏僻的游牧区，今年也都开辟了粮食和饲料基地，使牧区单一的牧业经济，迅速发展为饲养业与种植业并举的多种经济，为今后畜牧业的大发展创造了有利条件。在党的关怀和帮助下，现在各民族牧民“逐水草而居”的生活状况，已大大改变。他们依靠人民公社的优越性，建立定居点，大部分牧户盖了新房，定居下来。他们在定居的地方，办工厂，建学校，有的种了地，养了猪，成立了卫生所、幼儿园和食堂。这就迅速改变了牧区的落后面貌，使牧区的少数民族人民过着更加安定幸福的生活。
    森林工业是全盟国民经济中一个重要的生产部门。在过去三年中，由于各族林业职工艰苦奋斗，为国家采伐了成千万立方米木材。今年头十个月的木材生产，比去年同期增长了16.2％。随着木材生产的迅速增长，在茂密的森林里，职工们兴建铁路，开辟公路，及时把大量木材，运送到了国家需要的地方。在大跃进的日子里，林业职工提出“让大兴安岭万古长青”的战斗口号，认真贯彻执行采伐与更新并举的方针，抚育更新大面积林地。同时进行木材的综合利用，生产了大批野生纤维板和胶合板等新产品。现在大兴安岭林区各族职工，在党的领导下，正为把这块地方建成为祖国现代化的森林工业基地进行着创造性的劳动。
    随着生产建设的大发展，城乡人民的物质文化生活也迅速提高。现在，城市、农村、牧区和林区，普及了小学教育，兴建了许多中学和中等专业学校。农牧区和林区，已经建立起医疗网。特别是在游牧区，由于牧民初步定居和物质文化生活的改善，人口兴旺，到处呈现着一派
  “人畜两旺”的新景象。
    在三年连续跃进中，我们深深体会到：党的领导是我们一切事业取得胜利的根本保证，毛泽东思想是照耀我们前进的灯塔。呼伦贝尔盟各项生产建设，所以能取得如此巨大成就，正是毛泽东思想武装了我们各族人民的结果，是三面红旗引导着各族人民前进的结果。现在，当我们回想过去，看看现在，展望将来的时候，内心里充满了对我们伟大的党和敬爱的领袖毛主席的感激，充满了今后夺取更大胜利的信心。全盟各族人民，正在已经取得的伟大胜利的基础上，高举三面红旗，大家一条心，为1961年工农牧林业生产的持续跃进而奋勇前进！
