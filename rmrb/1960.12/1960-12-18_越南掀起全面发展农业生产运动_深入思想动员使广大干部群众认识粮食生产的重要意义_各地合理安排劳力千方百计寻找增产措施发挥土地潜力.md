Hanoi, December 17th (reported by this newspaper) – North Vietnam is launching an unprecedented large-scale movement to comprehensively develop agricultural production, especially grain production, in order to fully utilize the favorable natural conditions of the tropical region and tap the enormous labor potential of the countryside.

North Vietnam has warm climate, fertile land, and abundant water resources, with crops that can be harvested three to four times a year, providing excellent natural conditions for developing agricultural production. Since the preliminary realization of agricultural cooperativization in North Vietnam in October, ideological mobilization has been carried out from top to bottom and from bottom to top to enable the broad masses of cadres and farmers to recognize the importance of agricultural production, especially grain production, its direction of development, and its favorable conditions, and to prepare ideologically for the comprehensive development of agricultural production. In conjunction with ideological education, production increase plans and measures are also formulated and revised, so that ideological education and the formulation of plans and the search for measures promote each other, break old habits, and set production increase targets and practical and effective measures. At present, in the twelve provinces and autonomous regions where ideological mobilization has been relatively thorough, the production increase targets for summer rice, corn, sweet potatoes, and cassava have been increased by more than 15% after revision compared with the original plan, and the planting area has been expanded by 11%, of which the total output target for corn has been increased by 30% and the planting area has been expanded by 24%.

While ideological understanding is gradually improving and targets are being revised, various regions have sought to find ways to increase production by organizing mass symposiums. In order to exploit the potential of the land, various regions have generally planned to reclaim large areas of wasteland, use pondside vegetable gardens, and plant miscellaneous grains and cassava according to regional characteristics. They have vigorously practiced multiple cropping, intercropping, mixed cropping, and changed single-season crops to double-season crops, and double-season crops to three-season and four-season crops to expand the planting area. At the same time, they are building water conservancy projects, applying more fertilizer, and improving technology in the existing farmland to increase the yield per unit area.

Due to the increase in production targets and production increase measures, a new problem that has generally arisen is how to rationally arrange and use labor in order to fully exploit labor potential. In order to solve this problem, various regions generally comprehensively arrange agricultural work, while developing agriculture, animal husbandry, fishery, forestry, and other sideline productions, and also regularize basic construction such as water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, and improvement of agricultural tools, in order to solve the problem of large surplus of labor caused by small land and extensive cultivation in the past.

Due to the rational arrangement of labor, water conservancy construction in the North has been continuous throughout the year. From the beginning of this year to the end of October, a total of 100.2 million cubic meters of earthwork was excavated for water conservancy, an increase of 21% compared with the same period in 1959, and the irrigated area expanded by more than 129,000 hectares compared with the same period last year. At the same time, the construction of dams and dikes, the opening of ponds and ditches, and the conservation of water sources in the original paddy fields have also been better than in previous years. Various regions have also widely launched fertilizer accumulation movements. Mud ponds and toilets, which are sources of fertilizer, have gradually expanded in various parts of the North this year. The breeding area of Azolla, the main raw material for green manure, has doubled compared with previous years. (Attached picture)

    越南掀起全面发展农业生产运动
    深入思想动员使广大干部群众认识粮食生产的重要意义
    各地合理安排劳力千方百计寻找增产措施发挥土地潜力
    本报河内17日电　越南北方正在开展一个全面发展农业生产、特别是粮食生产的空前规模的运动，以便充分利用热带地区有利的自然条件和发掘农村巨大劳动潜力。
    越南北方气候温暖，土地肥沃，水利资源丰富，农作物一年可以三熟和四熟，有着发展农业生产的优越的自然条件。越南北方各地自10月初步实现农业合作化以后，即从上而下和从下而上的进行了思想动员，使广大干部和农民群众认识农业生产尤其是粮食生产的重要意义、发展方向和有利条件，作好全面发展农业生产的思想准备。结合思想教育还制订和修订增产计划和增产措施，使思想教育和订计划、找措施互相促进，打破旧习惯，订出增产指标和切实有效的措施。现在，思想发动较充分的十二个省和自治区的夏稻、玉米、甘薯、木薯的增产指标，修订以后比原订计划提高15％以上，种植面积扩大11％，其中玉米的总产量指标提高30％，播种面积扩大24％。
    在思想认识逐步提高和修订指标的同时，各地就通过组织群众专题座谈，千方百计寻找增产措施。为了发挥土地的潜力，各地普遍根据地区特点，计划大量开荒，利用池畔菜园，种植杂粮和木薯。大力复种、套种、间种、混种，改单季为双季，改双季为三季、四季，扩大种植面积。同时，在原有农田中兴修水利，增施肥料，改良技术，以提高单位面积产量。
    由于提高增产指标和增产措施，普遍发生的新问题是如何合理安排和使用劳动力，以便充分发挥劳动潜力。为了解决这一问题，各地一般全面安排农活，同时发展农业、畜牧、渔业、林业和其他副业生产，还把水利建设、积肥、改良农具等基本建设经常化，以解决过去遗留下来的由于土地少、耕作粗放而产生的劳动力大量剩余的问题。
    由于合理安排了劳动力，北方的水利建设保持常年不断，从今年年初到10月底，共挖水利土方一亿零二百多万立方米，比1959年同期增加21％，灌溉面积比去年同期扩大十二万九千多公顷。同时，在原有的水田中，修坝筑埂，开塘挖渠，保蓄水源，也比往年搞得好。各地还广泛展开积肥运动。作为肥料来源的泥塘、厕所，今年在北方各地逐渐扩大。绿肥的主要原料——桑花萍的养殖面积，比往年扩大了两倍。（附图片）
