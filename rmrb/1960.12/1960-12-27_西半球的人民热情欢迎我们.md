    The People of the Western Hemisphere Warmly Welcome Us
    Chen Zhongjing
    [Continued from yesterday]
    (V) Best Wishes
    From early August to early October, we performed in seven cities in Canada for two months, with an audience of over 70,000 people, and were similarly widely and warmly welcomed.
    Canada is a capitalist country that is highly subordinate to U.S. imperialism. Many large companies, nominally Canadian, are actually controlled by American parent companies, and Canadians cannot buy shares at all. Almost none of the larger industrial enterprises in Canada do not belong to the Morgan, Rockefeller, and other groups of the United States. The power of U.S. monopoly capital has actually invaded all aspects of Canadian life.
    However, Canadians have had enough of being bullied by the United States. We traveled back and forth across the Canadian mainland twice, and we deeply felt that among Canadians, including some relatively intelligent, insightful, and nationally self-respecting members of the bourgeoisie, there is a growing sense of concern, dissatisfaction, and indignation regarding the subordinate relationship between Canada and the United States. Why can't Canada have its own national economy and must be a branch of U.S. monopoly capital? Why can't Canada have its own national culture and must allow the so-called "culture" of the United States to dominate everything? Why can't Canada have an independent and autonomous domestic and foreign policy and must follow the United States step by step? These question marks are growing larger and larger. Ambitious Canadians are brewing a determination for independence and autonomy and have already begun to take action in some areas. Some newspapers have expressed pride in the fact that the Chinese Art Troupe appeared on the North American continent for the first time, first in Canada, only in Canada, and not in the United States.
    Because Canada has not had a war for nearly 150 years, because it has shared some of the high profits earned primarily by American capital through foreign investment, and because of the cheap labor provided by foreign immigrants (mostly bankrupt and impoverished people), Canada has experienced a certain degree of economic development in the past period, especially in the dozen or so years since World War II. However, this "good time" has begun to pass. Currently, the number of unemployed people in Canada is rapidly increasing, estimated to reach one million this winter and spring, which is one-fifth of the total national labor force. Large quantities of surplus agricultural products cannot be sold. In early September, steel production was only 69% of production capacity (82.2% in the same period in 1959). Based on the gradual deterioration of the Canadian economy and the further exposure and development of the evil consequences of American economic control, Canada's centrifugal tendency towards the United States and the political awareness of the Canadian people, especially the Canadian proletariat, will inevitably further develop. Currently, they have put forward the slogans of striving for peace and striving for neutrality; they believe that "striving for neutrality" is the first step to break free from American control.
    One of the deepest impressions we gained in Canada was the profound friendship expressed by many friends in the Canadian cultural and artistic circles, education circles, business circles, and other sectors. I remember one businessman who specially invited us to dinner and had a long talk with us. He enthusiastically discussed the general trend of the world; he talked about his hatred for the United States and his yearning for New China. When he finally said goodbye, he firmly shook our hands and said, "I invited you to dinner and had a long talk with you, not because I have any specific requests or intentions for you, but just to make you feel that you are not alone!"
    On the day we left Canada, the ship was about to set sail, and the people who were seeing us off were getting off the ship one after another. An elderly man who did not look like he was seeing us off, suddenly ran to my side and asked in a low voice, "Do you speak English?" I said, "Please do." He said in a loud voice, "Please give Mao Zedong my best regards!" After saying that, he turned around and went down the ship, and we didn't even have time to thank him. This was the last sentence we heard from a Canadian to us before we left Canadian soil. Dear Canadian friends, thank you for your deep friendship towards the Chinese people!
    (VI) Strong Resonance
    The four countries we visited have a prominent commonality in the cultural field, that is, since the beginning of this century, especially in the last dozen or so years, the influence of American cultural aggression has been extremely deep and great. In the three Latin American countries, the progressive national new culture movement is gradually developing along with the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal national democratic revolutionary struggle. Canada is no exception. In Canada, people of insight in the cultural circles and other fields are making various efforts to get rid of the bad influence of American culture and develop their own national culture, and have already achieved initial and valuable achievements.
    The reason why the programs performed by the art troupe in these countries (including Peking Opera's civilian and military plays, excerpts and full-length plays—"The White Snake" and "Wild Boar Forest," ethnic folk dances and music, and soprano solos) were so warmly welcomed, many friends believe, is not only because these programs have a certain artistic quality, but fundamentally, it is because of their popular and national character. The enthusiastic welcome received by programs such as "Red Silk Dance" at every performance was by no means accidental, reflecting the audience's excitement, longing, and celebration of the happiness and victory of the people. Our classical operas also have ideological content of anti-feudalism, anti-persecution, and striving for freedom and happiness, or are full of life atmosphere, which is easy for the audience to understand and resonate strongly with. These programs also have a unique national style, making the audience's senses very vivid and fresh. In particular, this kind of performance forms a good contrast with the chaotic and poisonous atmosphere spread by American cultural aggression, which obviously aroused great attention and joy among the local people, especially friends in the cultural and artistic circles. Their sincere and serious inquiries, investigations, and explorations of Chinese art moved us very much. A person who truly has enthusiasm and a serious attitude towards the cause of his nation and the cause of human happiness will adopt a welcoming, loving, and actively exploring attitude towards every truly beneficial achievement of other nations.
    (VII) Relatives
    There are nearly 60,000 overseas Chinese in these countries. Our visit naturally gave them great encouragement and comfort. And they gave us extremely warm welcome, support, and help. The overseas Chinese often called us "relatives from the motherland," and we also called them relatives. An old overseas Chinese in Venezuela, nearly seventy years old, had suffered all kinds of hardships overseas throughout his life. Now, meeting his relatives, he was filled with mixed feelings of grief and joy, and he couldn't help but burst into tears when he thought of the past. He couldn't be persuaded to stop. He said that he had finally met his relatives and had to cry to his heart's content. We comforted them: The motherland has become strong, which is the main reliance; everything is changing. "You see: we couldn't come to these countries in the past because of the sabotage and obstruction of the American reactionaries, but now we can come, isn't this a change?"
    (VIII) The "Monroe Doctrine" of the United States
    Before we went to Canada, when we were resting in a hotel in Cuba, a member of the group suddenly raised a question: "What is the Monroe Doctrine?" So we made some explanations and explorations. After talking about it, everyone couldn't help but burst into laughter.
    The Western Hemisphere has always been regarded as a forbidden fruit by U.S. imperialism. The definition of the "Monroe Doctrine" can be defined as follows: "The Americas are the Americas of American monopoly capital, and no one else should try to get involved." Eisenhower recently also put forward the so-called "New Monroe Doctrine." There are just some fools in the world who love to dream the most. It's really too oblivious to the characteristics of the times. The world today is not what it used to be. Now, the people of the Americas are really going to rise up and be the masters of the Americas. The American imperialists are shouting madly that a gap has been opened in the Western Hemisphere in Cuba, and that the Western Hemisphere should "unite" to jointly resist the "intrusion" of the "Sino-Soviet bloc." Who pays attention to this kind of mad shouting, what's the use? What should and is beginning to truly unite is the people of Latin America, the people of Latin America and North America—the people of the United States and Canada; they must further unite with the Soviet people, the Chinese people, all socialist countries, and the people of all countries in the world to jointly bury the so-called "Monroe Doctrine" and jointly send the "Monroe Doctrine" to the historical archives forever.
    We went from the "backyard" of the United States to the "front yard" of the United States. It seems that this "great rear" of the United States is very unstable. The American devils seem to be a bit stretched and unable to cope. Their days are not good, and the situation is very bad. The revolutionary movement in Latin America is booming. What about Canada? Please see an editorial in a Canadian bourgeois newspaper, The Toronto Daily Star, on September 8 this year, entitled "Why Canada Should Be Independent?" The first sentence clearly states: "Canada's independence must be defended, and American annexation or domination must be resisted." What kind of atmosphere, what kind of sound, isn't it clear?
    This time we went to the Americas to play music for the people there, and it seems that we really disturbed the American devils. All the way from south to north, the reactionaries' conspiracies to sabotage us have never stopped, and they have put a lot of effort into it. But overall, they are really powerless and cannot achieve anything. The police who were closely monitoring us originally eventually stood with the enthusiastic audience and waved to us and cheered. During a visit to a certain country, the "International Police Bureau" directly under the command of the American imperialist secret service had decided to search us. However, a hotel manager with a sense of justice refused to cooperate with them and publicly exposed the conspiracy in a newspaper. He believes that "it is unfair to treat Chinese artists and friendly envoys of the Chinese people in this way." Therefore, in the end, it was the reactionaries themselves who were isolated, not us. During this entire overseas visit, we often recited a sentence, which is: "The vast majority of people are our friends or can become friends, and the real enemies are only a very few."
    We have now returned to the motherland. Our minds are often thinking about the other side of the earth. The people of the Western Hemisphere bear the glorious and arduous task in the struggle against imperialist aggression and war policies and for lasting peace. We sincerely salute you. We thank you for your warm welcome to the Chinese Art Troupe and the Chinese people. We miss you and will always stand closely with you. (End) (Attached picture)

    西半球的人民热情欢迎我们
    陈忠经
    〔续昨〕
    （五）最好的问候
    我们从8月初到10月初，在加拿大的七个城市相继演出了两个月，观众七万余人次，同样受到广泛的热烈的欢迎。
    加拿大是一个对美帝国主义附属性极大的资本主义国家。很多很大的公司，名为加拿大的，而实际由美国的母公司控制，加拿大人根本不能购买股票。加拿大较大的工业企业几乎没有一家不是分别属于美国的摩根、洛克菲勒等集团的。美国垄断资本的势力，实际已经侵入加拿大生活的各个方面。
    但是，加拿大人受美国的气受够了。我们在加拿大大陆上来回走了两趟，耳闻目击，深深感觉到在加拿大人中间，包括资产阶级某些比较有头脑、有眼光、有民族自尊心的上层人士，对于加拿大与美国的这种主从关系，抱有愈来愈增长的隐忧、不平与愤懑。加拿大为什么不能有自己的民族经济，而必须是美国垄断资本的分支？加拿大为什么不能有自己的民族文化，而必须要让美国的所谓“文化”笼罩一切？加拿大为什么不能有独立自主的对内对外政策，而一定要跟着美国亦步亦趋？这几个问号愈画愈大。有抱负的加拿大人正在酝酿着一种独立自主的决心，并且在若干方面已经开始采取了行动。某些报纸曾经以中国艺术团首次出现在北美洲大陆上，先到加拿大、只到加拿大而不去美国感到自豪。
    由于将近一百五十年以来加拿大没有战争，由于通过对外投资分润到一些主要是美国资本所获得的高额利润，由于外国移民（大部分是破产的穷苦人民）所提供的廉价劳动力等等原因，加拿大在过去一段时间内，特别是二次世界大战以后的十几年以来，在经济上有一定的发展。但是这种“好景”已经开始成为过去了。目前加拿大失业人数正在迅速增加，估计今冬明春将达一百万人，即全国总劳动力的五分之一。大量剩余农产品卖不出去。9月初，钢的产量仅为生产能力的69％（1959年同期为82.2％）。在加拿大经济逐步恶化以及美国经济控制的恶果进一步暴露和发展的基础上，加拿大对美国的离心倾向和加拿大人民、首先是加拿大无产阶级的政治觉悟，必然会有进一步的发展。当前他们提出了争取和平、争取中立的口号；他们认为“争取中立”是从美国控制下解脱出来的第一步。
    我们在加拿大所得到的一个最深的印象，就是加拿大文化艺术界、教育界、工商界和其他各界许多朋友对我们所表示的深挚的友情。记得有一位商人，特别邀我们一道吃饭，和我们作长谈。他热情地纵论天下大势；谈到对美国的仇恨，对新中国的向往。最后分手道别的时候，他紧紧地握着我们的手说：“我请你们吃饭、长谈，对你们并没有什么具体要求和意图，只是要你们感觉到，你们并不孤单！”
    在我们离开加拿大的那一天，船快要启碇了，送行的人正在纷纷上岸，有一个并不是送我们的学者模样的老人，突然跑到我的旁边，附耳问道：“说英文吗？”我说：“请吧。”他放重声音说了一句：“请带给毛泽东最好的问候！”说罢掉头就下船去了，连我们道声感谢都来不及。这是我们离开加拿大国土前所听到的加拿大人对我们所讲的最后一句话。亲爱的加拿大朋友，感谢你们对中国人民的深挚友情！
    （六）强烈的共鸣
    我们所去的这四个国家，在文化领域中有一个突出的共同点，就是从本世纪初，特别是最近十几年以来，美国文化侵略的影响极深极大。拉丁美洲这三个国家，进步的民族的新文化运动正在伴随着反帝反封建的民族民主革命斗争逐渐开展起来。加拿大也不例外，他们那里文化界以及其他方面的有识之士正在为摆脱美国文化的恶劣影响、发展自己的民族文化作种种努力，并且已经取得了初步的可贵的成就。
    艺术团在这些国家所表演的节目（包括京剧的文戏和武戏、折子戏和本子戏——“白蛇传”、“野猪林”，民族民间的舞蹈和音乐，以及女高音独唱）之所以受到极大的欢迎，许多朋友认为，不仅仅是由于这些节目都具有一定的艺术性，而从根本上说，是由于它们的人民性和民族性。“红绸舞”等节目，场场受到狂热的欢迎决不是偶然的，这反映了观众们那种欣羡、向往和欢庆人民幸福和胜利的激动心情。我们的古典戏，也都具有反封建、反迫害，争取自由幸福的思想内容，或者是充满生活气息，很容易得到观众的理解和强烈的共鸣。这些节目也都具有独特的民族风格，使观众的耳目感觉十分生动新鲜。特别是这种表演与美国文化侵略所散布的混沌毒害气氛形成一个很好的对比，显然引起了当地人民特别是文化艺术界朋友们极大的重视和喜悦。他们那种对中国艺术的诚挚认真的询问、考察和探究，很使我们感动。一个真正对自己民族的事业和人类幸福的事业抱有热诚和严肃态度的人，对于别的民族的每一个真正有益于人民的成就是都会采取欢迎、喜爱和积极探讨的态度的。
    （七）亲人们
    这几个国家，一共差不多有六万华侨。我们此去，自然给了他们很大的鼓舞和安慰。而他们更是给了我们极为热情的欢迎、支持和帮助。侨胞们常常称呼我们作“祖国的亲人们”，我们也称呼他们是亲人。委内瑞拉有一位老华侨，将近七十岁了，一生在海外受尽千辛万苦，今番与亲人见面，悲喜交集，想起过去种种，不禁放声痛哭。怎么劝也劝不住。他说好容易和亲人见一面，一定要哭个痛快。我们安慰他们：祖国已经强大了，这是主要的依靠；一切事情都在变化。“你们看：我们过去由于美国反动派的破坏阻挠不能到这些国家来，现在能来了，这不就是一种变化吗？”
    （八）美国的“门罗主义”
    我们去加拿大以前，在古巴旅馆里休整的时候，一位团员忽然提出一个问题：“什么叫门罗主义？”于是我们就作了一番阐释和探讨，谈来谈去，结果大家不禁为之哄堂大笑。
    西半球，美帝国主义是一向视为禁脔的。“门罗主义”也者，其定义可以这样下：“美洲是美国垄断资本的美洲，别人休想染指。”艾森豪威尔最近还曾揭櫫所谓“新门罗主义”。世上就是有那么一些痴人，最爱说梦。实在也太不了然于时代的特征了。方今之世，已非昔比。现在，美洲的人民要真正起来做美洲的主人。美国帝国主义者狂喊甚么西半球已经在古巴被打开缺口了，西半球要“团结”起来，共同抵制“中苏集团”的“侵入”。这种狂喊有谁理睬呢，有甚么用处呢。真正应该并且正在开始团结起来的，是拉丁美洲的人民，是拉丁美洲的人民和北美洲——美国和加拿大的人民；他们并且要进一步和苏联人民、中国人民、所有社会主义国家以及全世界各国的人民团结起来，共同来埋葬所谓“门罗主义”，共同把“门罗主义”永远送进历史档案馆中去。
    我们从美国的“后院”走到美国的“前院”，看来美国的这个“大后方”很不稳。美国佬颇有点捉襟见肘，穷于应付的样子。他们的日子不好过，光景很不妙了。拉丁美洲的革命运动是蓬蓬勃勃。加拿大呢？请看今年9月8日加拿大一家资产阶级报纸《多伦多每日星报》的一篇社论，题目是“为甚么加拿大应该独立？”开宗明义第一句就是：“加拿大的独立必须加以保卫，美国的吞并或统治必须加以抵抗。”甚么空气，甚么声浪，还不清楚吗。
    我们这次去美洲，为那里的人民鼓瑟吹笙，看来确实惊动了美国佬。从南到北这一路，反动派对我们的阴谋破坏没有停息过，很费了一番心思。但是总起来一看，实在无能为力，不成气候。原来严密监视我们的警察们，到了最后也和热情的观众站在一起向我们招手欢呼。在某国访问时，美国帝国主义特务机关直接指挥之下的“国际警察局”已经决定动手搜查我们。但是，有正义感的旅馆经理拒绝同他们合作，并且在一个报刊上公开揭露了这个阴谋。他认为，“这样来对待中国的艺术家、对待中国人民的友好使者是不公平的。”所以，到头来被孤立起来的恰恰是反动派自己，而不是我们。我们在整个这次海外访问的期间，时常念道一句话，就是：“最大多数人是我们的朋友或可以成为朋友，真正的敌人只是极少数。”
    我们现在已经回到祖国了。我们的心思常常惦记着地球那一边。西半球的人民在反对帝国主义侵略和战争政策、争取持久和平的斗争中肩负着光荣的、艰巨的任务。我们衷心地向你们致敬。我们感谢你们对于中国艺术团、对于中国人民的热情欢迎。我们怀念你们，并且将永远紧密地和你们站在一起。（完）（附图片）
