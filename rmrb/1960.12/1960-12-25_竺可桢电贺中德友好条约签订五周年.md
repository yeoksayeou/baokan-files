    Xinhua News Agency, December 24th. Zhu Kezhen, President of the Sino-German Friendship Association, today sent a telegram to Lothar Bolz, Chairman of the German Democratic Republic League for Foreign Culture, warmly congratulating the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-German Friendship Treaty.
    The telegram said: "On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-German Friendship Treaty, I would like to extend warm congratulations to you, and through you to the people of the German Democratic Republic, on behalf of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with the German Democratic Republic. Five years ago, the signing of the Sino-German Friendship Treaty reflected the common aspirations of our two peoples to support each other, learn from each other, consolidate friendship, and strengthen unity. Over the past five years, the friendly cooperation between our two countries in the political, economic, and cultural fields has developed day by day, and the friendly unity between the two peoples has grown stronger. This friendly relationship between our two peoples is built on the basis of Marxist-Leninist proletarian internationalism and cannot be undermined by any force. This friendly unity is not only beneficial to the people of our two countries, but also beneficial to the entire socialist camp, and to the cause of defending world peace and striving for human progress. May the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the people of China and Germany last forever."
