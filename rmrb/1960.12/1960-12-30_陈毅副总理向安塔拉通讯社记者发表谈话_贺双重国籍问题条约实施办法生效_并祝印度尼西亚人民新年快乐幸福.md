Xinhua News Agency, December 29th: Vice Premier Chen Yi, on December 28th, gave a statement to Suwito, a reporter from the Indonesian Antara News Agency, regarding the announcement by the Chinese and Indonesian governments of the implementation measures for the Treaty on Dual Nationality. The full text is as follows:

    The announcement and implementation of the measures for the Treaty on Dual Nationality between the Chinese and Indonesian governments is a significant achievement of the two governments in resolving the Overseas Chinese issue through friendly consultation. It is also a new victory for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit, which deserves our warm congratulations.

    China and Indonesia, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, signed the Treaty on Dual Nationality in 1955 through friendly negotiations. Now, both sides, in the spirit of friendship and mutual accommodation, and after full consultation, have signed an implementation method. This implementation method is fair, reasonable, and practical, and it will pave the way for a comprehensive resolution of the Overseas Chinese issue.

    After the announcement and implementation of the Treaty on Dual Nationality, Overseas Chinese with dual nationality will choose their nationality based on the principle of voluntariness. Our government will take a favorable attitude towards Overseas Chinese who voluntarily choose Indonesian nationality. It is a great honor for both countries that Overseas Chinese can become citizens of the Republic of Indonesia and dedicate themselves to the national independence and construction of this country, and it is also a symbol of friendship between the two countries. Of course, our government also welcomes Overseas Chinese who voluntarily choose the nationality of the People's Republic of China. We will continue to advise them to abide by the laws of their country of residence, not to participate in the political activities of their country of residence, to help their country of residence develop its economy, and to live in harmony with the local people.

    The significant achievements made by China and Indonesia in resolving the Overseas Chinese issue through consultation are a heavy blow to the imperialists and reactionaries who attempt to use the Overseas Chinese issue to undermine the friendly relations between the two countries, and a great encouragement to the people of all countries in the world who hope to strengthen Asian-African solidarity. Indonesia is one of the initiators of the Bandung Conference, and China is a participant in the Bandung Conference. Both countries are united in opposing imperialism and colonialism, safeguarding world peace, and promoting Asian-African solidarity. Our two countries, holding high the banner of the Bandung Conference and strengthening friendly unity, are of great significance to the struggle of the Asian and African people to defend world peace and oppose colonialism. I believe that with the gradual resolution of the Overseas Chinese issue, the friendly relations between the two countries will have new developments.

    The year 1961 is approaching, and I would like to take this opportunity, on the eve of the New Year, to extend my greetings to the Indonesian people through Antara News Agency, wishing the Indonesian people a happy and prosperous New Year, and new achievements in developing the national economy and safeguarding peace in Asia and the Pacific. I hope that in 1961, the friendly relations between China and Indonesia will be further developed and consolidated.

    陈毅副总理向安塔拉通讯社记者发表谈话
    贺双重国籍问题条约实施办法生效
    并祝印度尼西亚人民新年快乐幸福
  新华社29日讯　陈毅副总理12月28日就中国政府和印度尼西亚政府公布关于双重国籍问题的条约的实施办法向印度尼西亚安塔拉通讯社记者苏维多发表的谈话，全文如下：
    中国政府和印度尼西亚政府关于双重国籍问题条约实施办法的公布生效，是两国政府通过友好协商解决华侨问题的一项重大成就，也是和平共处五项原则和万隆精神一个新的胜利，值得我们热烈祝贺。
    中国和印度尼西亚根据和平共处五项原则，通过友好谈判，在1955年签订了关于双重国籍问题的条约，现在双方又本着友好互让的精神，经过充分的协商，签订了一项实施办法。这个实施办法公平合理，切实可行，它将为华侨问题的全面解决铺平道路。
    双重国籍问题的条约的实施办法公布生效后，具有双重国籍的华侨将根据自愿原则，选择他们的国籍。我国政府对华侨自愿选择印度尼西亚国籍将采取赞同的态度。华侨能够成为印度尼西亚共和国的公民，献身于这个国家的民族独立和建设事业，这对两国来说，都是十分光荣的事，也是两国友谊的象征。对于自愿选择中华人民共和国国籍的华侨，我国政府也当然欢迎。我们将继续劝导他们遵守侨居国的法令，不参加侨居国的政治活动，帮助侨居国发展经济，同当地人民友好相处。
    中国和印度尼西亚协商解决华侨问题所取得的重大成就，对企图利用华侨问题破坏两国友好关系的帝国主义和反动派是一个沉重的打击，对希望加强亚非团结的世界各国人民是一个很大的鼓舞。印度尼西亚是万隆会议的发起国之一，中国是万隆会议的参加国，两国在反对帝国主义和殖民主义，保卫世界和平、促进亚非团结方面都是一致的。我们两国高举万隆会议的旗帜，加强友好团结，对亚非人民保卫世界和平，反对殖民主义的斗争具有重要的意义。我相信，随着华侨问题的逐步获得解决，两国的友好关系将会有新的发展。
    1961年即将来临，我愿意在新年的前夕，通过安塔拉通讯社向印度尼西亚人民致意，祝贺印度尼西亚人民新年快乐、幸福，在发展民族经济和维护亚洲和太平洋地区的和平事业中获得新的成就。我希望在1961年中国和印度尼西亚的友好关系将获得进一步的发展和巩固。
