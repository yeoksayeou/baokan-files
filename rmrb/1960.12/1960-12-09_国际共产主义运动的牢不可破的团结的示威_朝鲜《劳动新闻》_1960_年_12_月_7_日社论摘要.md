Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 8th: The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial on December 7th entitled "Demonstration of the Indestructible Solidarity of the International Communist Movement" regarding the declaration of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries.

The editorial stated that the convocation of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries and the declaration adopted at the meeting have great historical significance for the development of the international communist movement.

Representatives of 64 parties participated in the 1957 Moscow Conference, and representatives of 81 Communist and Workers' Parties from around the world participated in this meeting. Therefore, this is the meeting with the most party representatives participating in the history of the international communist movement. This fact itself proves the victorious advance of Marxism-Leninism throughout the world and the epoch-making development of the international communist movement.

The editorial stated that the participants in this meeting unanimously confirmed their loyalty to the 1957 Moscow Declaration.

The course of events in the past three years has confirmed the correctness of this declaration. The editorial also stated that in recent years, the international situation has undergone new changes that are even more favorable to socialism.

The editorial stated that the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and various socialist countries have achieved great victories in socialist and communist construction, and the power of the world socialist system has rapidly grown. The workers' movement against capitalist exploitation and oppression in capitalist countries is becoming increasingly vigorous, and the booming colonial national liberation struggle has fundamentally shaken the imperialist colonial system. The broad masses of people have more forcefully launched a struggle against the imperialist policy of aggression and to defend peace. Imperialism, which is on the road to decline and demise, is becoming increasingly desperate in the face of the invincible power of the growing and consolidating socialist camp and the tenacious revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries.

The editorial stated that this meeting, convened under such circumstances, exchanged and summarized the valuable experiences gained by the fraternal parties in the struggle during this period, and in the declaration of the meeting, based on a scientific analysis of the international situation, made clear answers to the basic principles of the current international communist movement. This declaration is our party's programmatic document and guide to action. It provides Marxist-Leninist elucidation on all important issues of the current period. It provides the working class and working people of the world with more powerful revolutionary weapons, and once again dealt a powerful blow to the imperialists and their lackeys.

The editorial stated that the convocation of this meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties and the issuance of the declaration demonstrated the indestructible unity of the socialist camp and Communist and Workers' Parties and made great contributions to the development of the international communist movement.

The editorial also stated that the frantic conspiracies and attempts by imperialists and their running dog revisionists to undermine the unity of the socialist camp and the international communist movement and to weaken the influence of socialism have been shattered. Life has proven that the wishful thinking and attempts of the imperialists, whether in the past, present, or future, are futile.

The editorial believes that the meeting's statement on the content of the era is "the most comprehensive and scientific analysis of the nature of the current era."

The editorial stated that all facts prove that imperialism has no power to stop the people's struggle for national independence, democracy, and socialism. The class contradictions in capitalist society have become more acute, and the corruption of capitalism has deepened. The infighting and contradictions between imperialist powers have also intensified.

The editorial then pointed out that the complete victory of socialism and the demise of imperialism are inevitable. This has further strengthened the clear vision of a happy future and the confidence in the victory of the struggle for the working masses and people around the world.

The editorial stated that the American imperialists who are now occupying South Korea will inevitably be defeated and destroyed in the face of the united struggle of the Korean people and the movement of historical progress, and the Korean people will surely triumph.

The editorial stated that the declaration comprehensively assessed imperialism, especially American imperialism. As the declaration pointed out, American imperialism is the biggest international exploiter, the chief culprit of world reaction, the international gendarme, and the ferocious enemy of the people of the world. The editorial stated that American imperialism is the main force of aggression and war and the main stronghold of modern colonialism.

The editorial pointed out that recognizing the reactionary nature of American imperialism is of great significance for the people who are struggling for peace, national independence, and social progress. Life demands strengthening the struggle against imperialist oppression and exploitation and for peace.

The editorial stated that, as the declaration pointed out, today, on the international stage, under the conditions of the powerful material and spiritual forces of socialism and peace overwhelming the imperialist forces of war, the imperialists can no longer arbitrarily launch wars as they did in the past.

However, in the real environment where imperialists continue to stubbornly pursue a policy of aggression and war, greater vigilance must be heightened. As long as imperialism exists, there will be soil for aggressive war. The nature of imperialism has not changed. Imperialists continue to expand their armaments, establish military bases everywhere in the world, and carry out military provocations.

The people of all countries know that the danger of a new world war has not been eliminated. Today, the struggle for peace is to raise the greatest vigilance, unremittingly expose the conspiracies of the imperialists, sharply watch the conspiracies and tricks of the war instigators, and unite all forces of peace to struggle and put pressure on the imperialists in all parts of the world, tying their hands and feet.

The editorial stated that the issue of raising vigilance against the imperialist war policy is even more urgent in the case of our country. We are directly confronting the chief culprit of aggression and war – the American imperialists. The American imperialists are strengthening their military forces in South Korea, transporting various new weapons, and continuing to conduct provocative military exercises.

Our party has firmly held high the banner of peace, taken positive measures to strive for peace, and continued to expose the war policies of the American imperialists and their lackeys, thereby mobilizing the masses and awakening them.

The editorial stated that peace should not be waited for, but should be strived for. Only by continuously strengthening the power of the socialist camp, actively developing the workers' movement within capitalist countries, igniting the flames of national liberation struggle even higher, and mobilizing all forces against the imperialist policy of aggression and war to strike and exert pressure on the imperialists everywhere in the world can peace be firmly maintained.

The recent heroic struggle of the South Korean people has not only severely hit the colonial rule of the American imperialists but has also seriously hit their war policy.

The editorial stated that the foreign policy of socialist countries such as the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, based on the principle of peaceful coexistence, is making a great contribution in exposing the war policy of the imperialists and safeguarding peace. The policy of peaceful coexistence is in line with the interests of all people who do not want a new war and strive for lasting peace.

The editorial stated that peaceful coexistence between countries does not mean abandoning class struggle as the revisionists advocate. Peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems is a form of class struggle between socialism and capitalism. This does not exclude the political and ideological struggle against capitalism but presupposes it.

The editorial stated that the declaration emphasizes actively fighting to realize the plan for comprehensive and thorough disarmament proposed by the Soviet Union.

The editorial also stated that at present, it is first necessary to carry out a tenacious struggle to achieve realistic results in banning nuclear weapons testing and nuclear weapons production, dissolving military blocs and abolishing military bases on foreign territories, and significantly reducing armaments and troops.

In the struggle for peace, the withdrawal of foreign troops from foreign territories is one of the most urgent tasks.

The editorial pointed out that at present, the American imperialists' occupation of South Korea has become a serious threat to peace in Korea and the Far East. For the sake of peace in Korea and the Far East, and for the sake of the peaceful reunification of Korea, the American imperialists must immediately withdraw from South Korea.

The Korean people will continue to carry out a powerful struggle together with the peace-loving people of the world to make the American imperialists withdraw from South Korea.

The editorial stated that this declaration profoundly analyzed the issue of national liberation revolution.

The editorial stated that the complete bankruptcy of colonialism is inevitable. However, liberation and the attainment of national independence from colonial rule are not formed naturally but are achieved in a fierce struggle against imperialism. Imperialists and colonial powers will not bestow freedom on the colonial people, nor will they automatically leave the countries they are exploiting.

The situation in the southern half of our motherland also truthfully shows this point. The imperialists, headed by American imperialism, the stronghold of modern colonialism, use their puppets to attempt to maintain their past colonial exploitation of the colonial people by using new methods and forms such as so-called "aid" and "military blocs."

The participants in this meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties believe that it is the duty of socialist countries and the international workers' movement and communist movement to give moral and material support to the people who are struggling to gain liberation from imperialist and colonialist oppression.

Our party has in the past, and will continue in the future, to express warm sympathy and support to the people of all countries who are struggling for national independence and liberation.

The editorial stated that this declaration, for the further development of the communist and workers' movement, more clearly elaborated the principled issues of revolutionary Marxist-Leninist theory, and at the same time, once again emphasized the need to continue to resolutely oppose all kinds of revisionism and dogmatism in the future, and to carry out the struggle to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism on two fronts.

Dogmatists only mechanically apply existing formulas and conclusions and cannot promptly see and correctly estimate the developing concrete reality. According to our experience, the danger of dogmatism is mainly manifested in their failure to combine Marxist-Leninist principles with the specific reality of their own country in socialist construction.

Revisionism is a reflection of bourgeois ideology, and as this declaration repeatedly points out, it remains the main danger in the current stage of the international workers' movement. Modern revisionists and right-wing opportunists, headed by the Yugoslav Tito group, distort Marxism-Leninism, emasculate its revolutionary spirit, and say that Marxism-Leninism is outdated. They defend imperialism and its policies in every way, spread illusions about imperialism, and carry out destructive activities against the socialist camp and the international communist movement.

Revisionism serves imperialism; It attempts to paralyze the revolutionary will of the working class and disarm workers and working masses in the struggle for peace, democracy, national liberation and the victory of socialism. Our party has consistently waged a resolute struggle against revisionism. In the future, we will continue to wage a tenacious struggle against it.

In particular, we are building socialism in a tense environment directly confronting the American imperialist aggressors, the heads of world reaction; therefore, a thorough struggle must be waged against revisionism and all bourgeois ideologies.

The editorial stated that defending the unity of the party is the guarantee for achieving victory in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

The editorial stated that one of the greatest achievements of this meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties is that it has further strengthened the unity of the socialist camp and the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries. The declaration has made the various principles regarding the relations between socialist countries and the relations between parties more concrete and developed it.

Today, strengthening the unity of the socialist camp and the unity of the international communist movement is an important issue for ensuring peace, national independence, and the victory of socialism and for determining the future destiny of mankind.

As clearly stipulated in the 1957 Moscow Declaration, the relationship between socialist countries and the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries is based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and socialist internationalism. This relationship is based on the principles of complete equality, mutual benefit, and comradely mutual assistance.

The editorial stated that this declaration points out that Communist and Workers' Parties will discuss urgent issues, exchange experiences, understand each other's views and positions when necessary, and reach unanimous opinions through consultation in the struggle for common goals; and pointed out that the interests of the working-class struggle require consistent compliance with views and conclusions jointly reached at their meetings, proceeding from the tasks of common struggle.

The relationship between the socialist camp and the fraternal parties of various countries in the world is precisely because it is firmly based on these principles, so their unity is conscious and voluntary and is truly consolidated.

The editorial stated that in the common struggle for the realization of the great Marxist-Leninist doctrine, socialist countries and Communist and Workers' Parties are united, closely cooperate, and actively support each other, which is the duty of proletarian internationalism.

Each Communist and Workers' Party formulates its own policies based on Marxist-Leninist principles, and they are fully responsible for the revolution in their own country, and also responsible for the international communist movement.

Our party and the Korean people are victoriously carrying out the Korean revolution and making practical contributions to strengthening the power of the socialist camp and developing the international communist movement.

Our party has always strengthened socialist internationalist education among the masses and, at the same time, continuously strengthened socialist patriotic education in coordination with this.

Our party and the Korean people have consistently made every effort to strengthen the mutual unity between the people of fraternal countries and to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp for the victory of world peace and socialism and for the victory of our common cause.

For us, the firm friendship with the people of our great neighbors, the Soviet Union and China, is especially precious.

In the future, we will further strengthen the friendship and unity with the people of these two countries, closely unite with the people of all socialist countries, and advance together. We will protect the unity and solidarity of the socialist camp and the international communist movement like the apple of our eye.

The editorial concluded by saying that the 1957 Moscow Declaration and this declaration are powerful ideological weapons for our people to build socialism and fight for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. Our party will continue to be faithful to the various principles of the 1957 Moscow Declaration and this declaration and take it as a guide to more strongly fight for the victory of our revolution. All our party members and people will unite as one around our party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, strive for greater achievements in the peaceful reunification of the motherland and socialist construction, contribute to the infinite prosperity of our nation, and contribute to the struggle of the people of all countries for peace, national independence, and socialism.

    国际共产主义运动的牢不可破的团结的示威
    朝鲜《劳动新闻》1960年12月7日社论摘要
    新华社平壤8日电　朝鲜《劳动新闻》7日就各国共产党和工人党代表会议声明发表了题为《国际共产主义运动的牢不可破的团结的示威》的社论。
    社论说，这次召开的各国共产党和工人党代表会议和在这次会议上通过的声明，对国际共产主义运动的发展有着巨大的历史意义。
    参加1957年莫斯科会议的有六十四个党的代表，参加这次会议的有世界八十一个共产党和工人党的代表。所以，这是国际共产主义运动史上最多的党的代表参加的会议。这个事实本身就证明了马克思列宁主义在全世界的胜利前进和国际共产主义运动的划时代的发展。
    社论说，参加这次会议的人一致确认他们忠于1957年莫斯科宣言。
  三年间的事变的进程证实了这个宣言的正确。社论又说，最近几年间，国际形势发生了对社会主义更加有利的新的变化。
    社论说苏联、中华人民共和国和各个社会主义国家在社会主义、共产主义建设中取得了巨大的胜利，世界社会主义体系的威力有了迅速的壮大。资本主义国家内的反对资本的剥削和压迫的工人运动日益更加高涨，蓬勃掀起的殖民地民族解放斗争从根本上动摇了帝国主义殖民体系。广大人民群众更加强有力地展开反对帝国主义侵略政策，保卫和平的斗争。走上衰退和没落的帝国主义在壮大巩固的社会主义阵营的战无不胜的威力和世界各国人民的顽强的革命斗争面前，更加日暮途穷了。
    社论说，在这样的形势下召开的这次会议交换和总结了兄弟党在这一期间的斗争过程中取得的宝贵的经验，并在会议的声明中根据对国际形势的科学的分析，对目前国际共产主义运动的基本的原则问题作出了明确答复。这个声明是我们党的纲领性文献和行动的指南。它对目前时期的一切重要问题作出了马克思列宁主义的阐明。它使全世界工人阶级和劳动人民有了更加有威力的革命武器，使帝国主义者及其奴仆又一次遭到了强有力的打击。
    社论说，这次召开的共产党和工人党代表会议和发表的声明，显示了社会主义阵营和共产党和工人党的牢不可破的团结一致，对国际共产主义运动的发展作出了巨大的贡献。
    社论又说，帝国主义者及其走卒修正主义者为了破坏社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结，为了削弱社会主义的影响而进行的疯狂阴谋企图被粉碎了。生活证明，帝国主义者的妄想和企图，不论过去还是现在和将来都是徒劳无益的。
    社论认为会议声明关于时代内容的阐述是“最全面地和科学地分析了当前时代的性质。”
    社论说，一切事实证明，帝国主义是没有力量阻止人民争取民族独立、民主和社会主义的斗争的。资本主义社会的阶级矛盾更加尖锐化了，资本主义的腐败加深了。帝国主义大国间的倾轧和矛盾也加剧了。
    社论接着指出，社会主义的完全胜利和帝国主义的灭亡是不可避免的。这更加坚定了全世界劳动群众和人民对幸福的未来的清晰的前景和对斗争胜利的信心。
    社论说，现在强占着南朝鲜的美帝国主义者在朝鲜人民团结起来的斗争和历史前进运动面前必将遭到失败和灭亡，朝鲜人民必将胜利。
    社论说，声明全面估价了帝国主义特别是美帝国主义。正如声明指出的一样，美帝国主义是最大的国际剥削者、是世界反动的元凶、是国际宪兵、是全世界人民的凶恶的敌人。社论说，美帝国主义是侵略和战争的主要势力，是现代殖民主义的主要堡垒。
    社论指出，认清美帝国主义的反动本性，对为争取和平、民族独立和社会进步进行斗争的人民来说具有重要的意义。生活要求加强反对帝国主义的压迫和剥削、争取和平的斗争。
    社论说，正如声明中指出的一样，今天在国际舞台上社会主义和和平力量在压倒帝国主义战争势力的强大的物质、精神力量的条件下，帝国主义者再不能像从前那样地任意发动战争了。
    但是，在帝国主义者继续执拗地追求侵略政策和战争政策的现实环境中，必须提高更大的警惕性。只要帝国主义存在，就有侵略战争的土壤。帝国主义的本性没有改变。帝国主义者继续扩张军备、在世界到处建立军事基地、进行军事挑衅。
    各国人民都知道新的世界大战的危险并没有消除。今天争取和平的斗争，就是要提高最大的警惕、不懈地揭露帝国主义的阴谋、尖锐地注视战争放火者的阴谋诡计、团结一切和平力量进行斗争。
    社论说，对帝国主义者战争政策提高警惕的问题，在我国的情况下是更为迫切的。我们同侵略和战争的元凶——美帝国主义者直接对峙着。美帝国主义者正在南朝鲜增强军事力量，运入各种新式武器，继续进行挑衅性的军事演习。
    我们党牢牢地举起和平的旗帜，采取了争取和平的积极措施，并继续揭露美帝国主义者及其走狗的战争政策，从而动员了群众，使群众觉悟了起来。
    社论说，不应等待和平，而应该去争取。只有不断地加强社会主义阵营的威力，积极地发展资本主义国家内部的工人运动，更高地燃起民族解放斗争的火焰，动员一切反对帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策的力量来在世界各地打击帝国主义者，并对它们施加压力，捆住它们的手足，才能牢牢地维护住和平。
    最近南朝鲜人民英雄的斗争，不仅沉重地打击了美帝国主义者的殖民地统治制度，而且还严重地打击了它们的战争政策。
    社论说，基于和平共处原则的苏联和中华人民共和国等社会主义各国的对外政策，正在揭露帝国主义者的战争政策和维护和平方面作出巨大的贡献。和平共处政策，符合于不愿意新战争、为争取持久和平而努力的所有人民的利益。
    社论说，国与国之间的和平共处，并不意味着像修正主义者所主张的那样放弃阶级斗争。不同社会制度国家的和平共处，是社会主义和资本主义之间的阶级斗争的一种形式。这并不是排除同资本主义的政策、思想斗争，而是以它为前提的。
    社论说，声明强调，为实现苏联提出的全面彻底裁军计划而积极地斗争。
    社论又说，当前，首先要为禁止核武器试验和核武器生产、解散军事集团和撤消在别国领土上的军事基地、显著地裁减军备和兵力等带来现实结果而进行顽强的斗争。
    在为和平的斗争中，从别国领土上撤出外国军队是最迫切的任务之一。
    社论指出，当前，美帝国主义者对南朝鲜的强占，成了对于朝鲜和远东和平的严重威胁。为了朝鲜和远东的和平，为了朝鲜的和平统一，美帝国主义者必须立即从南朝鲜撤走。
    朝鲜人民将同全世界爱好和平人民一道为使美帝国主义者撤出南朝鲜而继续进行强有力的斗争。
    社论说，这次声明，深刻地分析了关于民族解放革命的问题。
    社论说，殖民主义的完全破产是不可避免的。然而，从殖民地统治下获得解放和民族独立的取得，并不是自然而然地形成的，而是在同帝国主义的激烈斗争中取得的。帝国主义者和拥有殖民地的大国，是不会把自由恩赐给殖民地人民的，也不会自动离开被它们所剥削着的国家的。
    我们祖国南半部的情况，也正是如实地表明了这一点。以现代殖民主义的堡垒美帝国主义为首的帝国主义者利用自己的傀儡，企图用所谓“援助”和“军事集团”等新的方法和形式来维持过去对殖民地人民的殖民地剥削。
    这次共产党和工人党代表会议参加者认为，给予为争取从帝国主义和殖民主义压迫中获得解放而斗争的人民以道义上和物质上的大力支持，是社会主义各国和国际工人运动和共产主义运动的义务。
    我们党过去已经、今后仍然将对为争取民族独立和解放而斗争的各国人民，表示热烈的同情和支持。
    社论说，这次声明为了共产主义和工人运动的进一步发展，更清楚地阐明了革命的马克思列宁主义理论的原则问题，同时再一次强调了关于今后继续坚决地展开反对各种修正主义和教条主义，在两条战线上进行保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性的斗争的必要性。
    教条主义者只会搬用现有的公式和结论，不能及时地看到而且也不能正确地估计发展着的具体现实。根据我们的经验，教条主义的危险，就是着重表现在他们在社会主义建设中不会把马克思列宁主义原则和本国的具体现实相结合起来。
    修正主义是资产阶级思想的反映，正如这次声明所一再指出的，它仍然是现阶段国际工人运动中的主要危险。以南斯拉夫铁托集团为首的现代修正主义者和右倾机会主义者歪曲马克思列宁主义，阉割其革命精神，说马克思列宁主义已经过时。他们从各个方面为帝国主义及其政策辩护，散布对帝国主义的幻想，进行反对社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的破坏活动。
    修正主义为帝国主义服务，它企图麻痹工人阶级的革命意志，在争取和平、民主、民族解放和社会主义的胜利的斗争中，解除工人和劳动群众的武装。我们党始终一贯地为反对修正主义，进行了坚决的斗争。今后，我们将仍然为反对它而继续进行顽强的斗争。
    特别是，我们是在同世界反动派的头子美帝国主义侵略者直接对峙着的紧张的环境里建设社会主义的，因此，必须进行彻底的斗争来反对修正主义和一切资产阶级思想。
    社论说，捍卫党的统一是社会主义革命和社会主义建设取得胜利的保证。
    社论说，这次共产党和工人党代表会议所取得的最巨大的成就之一就是，它进一步加强了社会主义阵营和各国共产党和工人党的团结。声明把关于社会主义国家之间的关系和各国党之间的关系的各项原则更加具体化了，并且发展了它。
    今天，加强社会主义阵营的团结和国际共产主义运动的团结，是保证和平、民族独立和社会主义胜利，是决定人类将来命运的重要问题。
    正如1957年莫斯科会议宣言所明白规定的，社会主义国家和各国共产党及工人党的相互关系是以马克思列宁主义和社会主义国际主义原则为基础的。这一关系是以完全平等、互惠和同志般的互相援助的原则为基础的。
    社论说，这次声明指出，共产党和工人党将在必要时讨论迫切的问题、交流经验，互相了解观点和立场，在为共同的目的而进行的斗争中，以协商的方法取得一致的意见，并指出，工人阶级斗争的利益要求一致遵守从共同斗争任务出发，在自己的会议上共同得出的看法和结论。
    社会主义阵营和世界各国兄弟党之间的关系正是由于巩固地基于这些原则，因而它们之间的团结是自觉自愿的，是真正巩固的。
    社论说，在为实现伟大的马克思列宁主义学说而进行的共同斗争中，社会主义国家和共产党及工人党团结一致，密切合作，相互积极支援，是无产阶级国际主义的义务。
    每个共产党和工人党都根据马克思列宁主义原则，各自规定自己的政策，它们对本国革命完全负责，同时也对国际共产主义运动负责。
    我们党和朝鲜人民胜利地进行着朝鲜革命，对加强社会主义阵营的威力和发展国际共产主义运动作出了实际的贡献。
    我们党一贯在群众中加强社会主义国际主义教育，同时也配合这一点不断加强社会主义爱国主义教育。
  我们党和朝鲜人民为了世界和平和社会主义的胜利，为了我们共同事业的胜利，一贯为加强兄弟国家人民之间的相互团结和加强社会主义阵营的团结尽了一切努力。
    对于我们来说，同伟大的邻邦苏联、中国两国人民的牢固的友谊尤其宝贵。
    今后我们也将进一步加强同这两个国家的人民的友谊和团结，同所有社会主义国家的人民紧密团结，共同前进。我们将像爱护眼珠一样，保护社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动队伍的统一团结。
    社论最后说，1957年莫斯科会议宣言和这次声明是我国人民建设社会主义和为祖国和平统一而斗争的强有力的思想武器。我们的党今后仍然将忠实于1957年莫斯科宣言和这次声明的各项原则，并把它作为指针，更加坚强地为我们革命的胜利而斗争。我们的全体党员和人民将钢铁般地团结在以金日成同志为首的我们党的周围，在祖国的和平统一和社会主义建设中争取更大的成就，为使我们民族无限繁荣和对各国人民争取和平、民族独立与社会主义的斗争作出贡献。
