Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 28th: The employees of the Shenyang Standard Parts Factory have outstandingly completed the glorious task of "playing a good supporting role." They have comprehensively overfulfilled the annual national plan for this year two months ahead of schedule.

The screws, nuts, cotter pins, and spring washers produced by this factory are supplied to more than 300 enterprises in various regions and are indispensable accessories for various types of machinery and equipment. All factory employees have a deep understanding of the principle that "large machines cannot do without small screws." They are using high revolutionary enthusiasm and solid technical organizational measures to overcome various difficulties and realize a comprehensive leap forward in production. This year, the variety of parts they produce has increased from more than 110 last year to more than 130, filling several gaps in domestic screw types. The quality of the products leaving the factory is excellent, and they have been praised by users. Product output has increased by more than 30% compared to last year. Labor productivity has increased by 58% compared to last year. The total cost of products has decreased by 1.31 million yuan compared to last year. Both product quality and low cost rank among the top among similar factories nationwide.

Since the beginning of this year, the factory has launched a vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Li Jingzi, an old worker with more than 20 years of service, with the support of the Party organization, and after more than 40 experiments, first reformed the main equipment, the friction press, into automated equipment. Subsequently, the whole factory set off a climax of reforming old equipment. Within a few months, more than 110 old equipment in the factory were reformed into automated or semi-automated, and production efficiency increased by an average of 50%. More than 70 pieces of various equipment were also manufactured. On this basis, in the second half of the year, 27 automatic production lines and production linkage lines were formed, saving more than 600 laborers to support agriculture and other departments. In response to the difficulty of insufficient raw materials, all factory employees took various measures to save more than 1,400 tons of steel in more than half a year. The employees of the tool workshop changed 21 types of tools and molds, such as initial punches and top molds, from cutting to hot pressing and cold stamping, and reformed the tool design, saving more than 15 tons of tool steel in one month.

Under the slogan of "Produce whatever the state needs, and produce as much as the state needs," the factory's employees also overcame difficulties to successfully trial-produce more than 30 new products, which not only met the country's urgent needs but also improved the technical level of the enterprise.

    沈阳标准件厂“配角”当得好
    配件品种增加　补起一些缺门　产品质量优良
    新华社沈阳28日电　沈阳标准件厂职工出色地完成了“当好配角”的光荣任务。他们已经提前两个月全面超额完成了今年全年的国家计划。
    这个厂生产的螺钉、螺帽、开口肖和弹簧垫等，供应各地三百多个企业，是各种机器设备不可缺少的配件。全厂职工对“大机器离不开小螺钉”的道理有深刻的体会，他们都以高度的革命热情和扎扎实实的技术组织措施，来战胜各种困难，实现生产的全面跃进。今年他们生产的配件品种，由去年的一百零几种增加到一百三十多种，补上了国内螺钉品种的若干缺门；出厂的产品质量优良，受到了用户的赞扬；产品产量比去年提高30％以上；劳动生产率比去年提高58％；产品总成本比去年降低了一百三十一万元。产品质量好，成本低，都名列全国同类厂的前茅。
    今年从年初起，这个厂开展了轰轰烈烈的技术革新和技术革命运动。有二十多年工龄的老工人历敬子，在党组织支持下，经过四十多次试验，首先把主要设备磨擦压力机改革成了自动化的设备。接着，全厂就掀起了改革旧设备的高潮。几个月内，全厂一百一十多台老设备都被改革成为自动化或半自动化，生产效率平均提高50％；还造出各种设备七十多台。在这基础上，下半年又组成二十七条生产自动线和生产联动线，共节约出六百多名劳动力支援了农业和其它部门。针对原材料不足的困难，全厂职工采取各种措施，半年多来节约钢材一千四百多吨。工具车间职工将初冲、顶模等二十一种工具、模具由切削改为热压冷冲，改革了工具设计，一个月就节约工具钢材十五吨多。
    在“国家要什么就生产什么，要多少就生产多少”的口号下，这个厂职工还克服困难试制成功新产品三十多种，既满足了国家急需，又提高了企业的技术水平。
