    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 17th: The Soviet newspaper "Red Star" published many materials on the third page on the 15th, exposing the aggressive activities of U.S. imperialism. The banner headline on this page was: "American Imperialism is the Main Force of Aggression and War."

    The editor's note said that the working people of the world, with hopeful and excited hearts, and with unshakable confidence in the bright future of mankind, are repeatedly reading the historic documents of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries. These documents express the wishes and feelings of hundreds of millions of working people. These documents point out the clear path to the victory of peace, democracy, and socialism. The meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties pointed out that under modern conditions, war is not inevitable and can be prevented. But this does not mean that the danger of a new world war has now disappeared.

    The note said that peace-loving people of all countries have seen with their own eyes that the main force of aggression and war is U.S. imperialism. It is engaged in an unprecedented arms race in history. U.S. imperialism is implementing bellicose and reactionary ideas in its policies, and in the capitalist countries that are subordinate to it, it is setting up aggressive blocs and military bases everywhere to oppose socialist countries. It is none other than the forces of U.S. imperialism that oppose disarmament and oppose the prohibition of atomic weapons.

    The note concluded by saying that the materials published in this issue show that now more than ever, people of all countries need to be especially vigilant. The duty of the Soviet army is to vigilantly watch the conspiracies of warmongers and be ready at all times to give a devastating rebuff to any aggressor.

    苏联《红星报》以大量事实揭露
    美帝国主义是侵略和战争的主要力量
    指出各国人民应特别提高警惕　要求苏军时刻准备回击侵略者
    新华社莫斯科17日电　苏联《红星报》15日在第三版以整版篇幅发表许多材料，揭露美帝国主义的侵略活动。这一版的通栏大标题是：“美国帝国主义是侵略和战争的主要力量”。
    编辑部按语中说，全世界劳动人民满怀希望和兴奋的心情，抱着对人类光明未来不可动摇的信心，反复阅读着各国共产党和工人党代表会议的历史性文件，这些文件表达了亿万劳动人民的愿望和感情。在这些文件里指出了走向和平、民主和社会主义事业胜利的明确道路。共产党和工人党代表会议指出，在现代条件下，战争不是不可避免的，战争是可以防止的。但是这不意味着现在新的世界战争的危险性已经消失了。
    按语说，各国爱好和平的人民亲眼看到，侵略和战争的主要力量是美国帝国主义。它正在进行历史上空前的军备竞赛。美国帝国主义在自己的政策中贯彻着好战的反动思想，在附属于它的资本主义国家中，遍设侵略集团和军事基地来反对社会主义国家。反对裁军和反对禁止原子武器的不是别人，正是美国帝国主义势力。
    按语最后说，本版发表的材料说明，现在比任何时候都需要各国人民具有特别高度的警惕性。苏军的职责是警惕地注视战争挑拨者的阴谋，时刻准备着给任何侵略者以毁灭性的回击。
