    North Korea and Vietnam: Many Factories and Mines Advance in Completing Production Plans
    North Korea: Steel plants produce twice as much steel plate in the first ten months as in the same period last year.
    Vietnam: Factories and mines pay attention to reducing product costs while completing plans ahead of schedule.
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 27th - Good news is pouring in from many factories, mines and enterprises in North Korea, victoriously completing their annual production plans ahead of schedule.
    According to reports in the local newspapers, steel plants completed their annual steel plate production plans by the end of October, with ordinary steel plate production in the first ten months of this year doubling compared to the same period last year. Workers at the Chongjin Steel Works, which completed its annual total output value plan on October 25th, have recently launched an even more fervent production increase competition for the "Red Flag" and "Red Star." Their completed annual production plan represents a 20.7% increase over last year's actual output value.
    The Dayudong, Unsan, and Suan mines have all completed their annual production plans. Among them, the miners of the Unsan Mine increased labor productivity by 85% in the third quarter of this year and exceeded this year's production plan by 37.1% by October 20th. Since the beginning of this year, workers at the Ongjin Mine have been widely engaged in technical innovation movements, and now 80% of the transportation work in the tunnels has been mechanized, and more than twenty mining and ore dressing processes have been automated. They completed this year's total output value plan on November 9th.
    Silk mills belonging to the North Korean Light Industry Committee exceeded this year's production plan by November 10th. The silk fabrics produced by these factories in the past ten months are equivalent to twelve times the total output of textiles in northern Korea in 1944, and forty-three times the total output of silk fabrics. The achievement of completing the plan ahead of schedule and exceeding it is the result of the silk mills' vigorous mass technical innovation movement and increased labor productivity. Workers at the Pyongyang Silk Reeling Factory and the Hamhung Silk Reeling Factory have newly installed automatic silk reeling machines and other machines, greatly increasing labor productivity.
    In the democratic capital, Pyongyang, even more factories and enterprises have completed this year's production plans ahead of schedule. The famous Pyongyang Rubber Factory completed this year's production plan on November 7th. Now this factory can produce the same amount of various rubber products in just over a month as it did in the entire year of 1954. Thanks to the response to the decision of the 1959 December Plenary Session of the Korean Workers' Party and the strengthening of the mass technical innovation movement, they increased labor productivity by 23.4% in the first half of the year and 26.5% in October. The Pyongyang Metal Measuring Tool Factory completed the state's production task on August 30th, and by October 27th had exceeded it by 21.5%. The workers of this factory are determined to complete the production tasks assigned by the state by the end of the year with a score of 150%. Workers at the Pyongyang Honorary Disabled Soldiers Factory, which mainly produces daily necessities and office supplies, exceeded this year's plan by October 31st. This year, they increased the number of products by nine and reduced production costs by 15.8%. Workers at the East Pyongyang Construction Company completed this year's construction plan, which was one and a half times more than last year, on October 26th. Workers in the local industrial sector are also competing with each other to increase production. The textile factories in the South Pyongan Province local industrial system had exceeded the annual cloth production plan by 20.8% by the end of October.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 27th - A large number of heavy and light industrial enterprises in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have completed the Three-Year Plan (1958-1960) ahead of schedule.
    So far, a total of sixteen heavy industrial enterprises have completed the Three-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The twenty-five enterprises and units, including the Co Dinh chromite mine, the Na Duong coal mine, and the Tuyen Quang refractory brick factory, which completed the plan the earliest, reported good news one after another as early as October. In order to complete the Three-Year Plan ahead of schedule, the employees of the Gia Lam Locomotive Repair Factory in Hanoi have successively proposed 634 rationalization proposals, which have increased production by 210% compared with three years ago, increased labor productivity by 220%, shortened the locomotive repair time by 23%, and shortened the carriage repair time by an average of 74%. In this way, the factory completed the Three-Year Plan two hundred and fifteen days ahead of schedule.
    In light industry, eleven enterprises have completed this year's production plan ahead of schedule, and their total output value has exceeded the original planned target by 2% to 40% respectively. In addition, seventeen factories have completed the November production plan ahead of schedule and exceeded the target; at present, they are further striving to complete the Three-Year Plan and this year's annual production plan ahead of schedule.
    In the process of striving to complete the production plan ahead of schedule, all factories and mines generally pay attention to reducing the cost of products. Compared with three years ago, the Gia Lam Locomotive Repair Factory in Hanoi has now reduced the cost of carriage repair by 22%, thereby saving the country more than one million yuan. Railway workers, due to boldly innovating production technology, have proposed more than 2,000 rationalization proposals. As a result, they not only created more than one million yuan in wealth, but also made a significant contribution to completing the Three-Year Plan sixty-four days ahead of schedule. Many light industrial enterprises also try to use waste materials as much as possible in production, which has also significantly reduced production costs. (Attached picture)

    新华社平壤27日电　朝鲜许多厂矿企业单位胜利提前完成今年度全年生产计划的捷报纷纷传来。
    据这里的报纸报道，各钢铁厂在10月底已提前完成了钢板的全年生产计划，今年头十个月生产的普通钢板相当于去年同期的两倍。已在10月25日完成全年总产值计划的城津炼钢厂的工人最近进一步热火朝天地展开夺“红旗”和“红星”的增产竞赛运动。他们已完成的今年度生产计划比去年实际产值增长了20.7％。
    大榆洞、云山、遂安等矿山都已完成了今年度的生产计划。其中云山矿山的矿工们今年第三季度提高了劳动生产率85％，到10月20日已超额完成今年生产计划的37.1％。瓮津矿山的工人从今年年初起就广泛地展开技术革新运动，现在坑道内已有80％的搬运工作实现机械化，有二十多道采矿、选矿工序实现自动化，他们已在11月9日完成了今年度的生产总产值计划。
    属于朝鲜轻工业委员会的各丝织厂已在11月10日超额完成今年度的生产计划。这些工厂在过去十个月中所生产的丝织品相当于1944年朝鲜北部的纺织品总产量的十二倍，丝织品总产量的四十三倍。提前超额完成计划的成绩是各丝织厂大搞群众技术革新运动、提高劳动生产率的结果。平壤缫丝厂和咸兴缫丝厂的工人新装置了自动缫丝机等机器，劳动生产率大大提高。
    在民主首都——平壤市有更多的工厂企业提前完成今年度的生产计划。著名的平壤橡胶厂已在11月7日完成了今年度的生产计划。现在这个工厂只要用一个多月的时间就能完成1954年一年中所生产的各种橡胶制品。由于响应朝鲜劳动党1959年12月全会的决定，加强了群众技术革新运动，他们在上半年提高了劳动生产率23.4％，10月份提高了26.5％。平壤金属量具工厂在8月30日就完成了国家的生产任务，到10月27日已超额完成了21.5％，这个工厂的工人决心到年底以150％的成绩来完成国家所交给的生产任务。主要是生产日用品和办公用具的平壤荣誉军人工厂的工人，到10月31日已超额完成了今年的计划。今年内他们增加了九种产品，降低了15.8％的生产成本。东平壤建筑公司工人在10月26日就完成了比去年增加了一倍半的今年的施工计划。地方工业部门的工人也你追我赶地展开增产竞赛。平安南道地方工业系统的各纺织厂到10月底为止已超额20.8％完成了今年全年的布匹生产计划。
    新华社河内27日电　越南民主共和国的大批重工业和轻工业企业已经提前完成了三年计划（1958—1960年）。
    到目前为止，共有十六个重工业企业提前完成了三年计划。完成计划最早的古定铬铁矿、那养煤矿和宣光耐火砖厂等二十五个企业和单位，早在10月份就相继传出捷报。河内嘉林机车修理厂职工为提前完成三年计划，先后提出六百三十四项合理化建议，使生产比三年前增加了210％，使劳动生产率提高了220％，使机车修理时间缩短了23％，车厢修理时间平均缩短了74％。这样，就使全厂提前二百一十五天完成了三年计划。
    在轻工业中，已经有十一个企业提前完成了今年的生产计划，它们的生产总值分别超过原订计划指标2％到40％。此外，还有十七个工厂提前超额完成了11月份的生产计划；目前，它们正进一步努力争取提前完成三年计划和今年全年的生产计划。
    各厂矿企业在争取提前完成生产计划的过程中，普遍注意降低产品的成本。和三年前比较，河内嘉林机车修理厂目前已经把车厢修理成本降低了22％，从而为国家节约了一百多万元。铁路部门的青年工人，由于大胆革新生产技术，共提出两千多项合理化建议，结果，不但创造了一百多万元的财富，还对提前六十四天完成三年计划作出了重大贡献。许多轻工业企业在生产中，还尽量利用废材料，也使生产成本有了显著的降低。（附图片）
