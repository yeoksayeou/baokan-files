Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 8th: Japanese Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda formed his second cabinet today, continuing to pursue a policy of following the United States and implementing the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. The new cabinet was sworn in this morning.

Ikeda Hayato said at a press conference this afternoon that the new cabinet "will not change the policy of cooperating with the United States." He also wants to "be responsible for assisting" the United States in salvaging its economic crisis, and to this end, he will not hesitate to sacrifice Japan's national interests and "accelerate the realization of trade liberalization." He added: "The diplomacy towards China will not change from the time of the first Ikeda cabinet." Ikeda stated that while continuing to "cooperate" with the United States, Japan "will also focus its efforts on Western Europe and the countries of Asia and Africa," and Japan will "make special efforts" to expand into the Asia-Africa region.

According to the instructions of the Japanese monopoly capital group that he form a "unified party" cabinet, Ikeda incorporated all factions within the Liberal Democratic Party into his new cabinet. Of the seventeen cabinet members, the Ikeda faction occupies six minister positions, the Sato faction three, the Kishi Nobusuke faction two, and the remaining six factions one each. Therefore, United Press International said that the two factions led by Nobusuke Kishi and his younger brother Eisaku Sato are "the two wheels of the Ikeda chariot." Kyodo News said, "The important members of the second Ikeda cabinet are almost the same as those of the first Ikeda cabinet, and people cannot see a big difference in the nature of (this cabinet) compared to the first Ikeda cabinet."

    组成新内阁　执行老政策
    池田叫嚷要继续追随美国
    据新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本首相池田勇人今天组成他的第二届内阁，继续执行追随美国、实施日美军事同盟条约的政策。新内阁已经在今天上午宣誓就职。
    池田勇人今天下午在记者招待会上说：新内阁“不改变同美国合作的方针”。他并且要“负责协助”美国挽救经济危机，为此不惜牺牲日本民族利益，“加紧实现贸易自由化”。他又说：“对中国的外交，同第一届池田内阁当时没有改变”。池田表示，在继续与美国“合作”的同时，日本“还要把力量用在西欧和亚非各国这一方面”，日本将“特别努力”向亚非地区扩张。
    池田根据日本垄断资本集团要他组成“举党一致”内阁的指示，把自由民主党内各派系都纳入他的新内阁。在十七名阁员中，池田派占据六个大臣，佐藤派占三名，岸信介派占二名，其余六个派系各一人。因此，美国合众国际社说，岸信介和他的胞弟佐藤荣作所率领的两派是“池田马车的两个车轮”。共同社说，“第二届池田内阁的重要阁员几乎和第一届池田内阁没有两样，人们看不出（这届内阁）在性质上同第一届池田内阁有大不相同的地方。”
