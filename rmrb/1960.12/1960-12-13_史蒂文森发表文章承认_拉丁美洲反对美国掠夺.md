Xinhua News Agency, December 10th – Former U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson, in an article titled "Our Predicament in Latin America" published in the American magazine *Look* on November 22nd, admitted that during his visit to Latin America, he discovered the existence of "anti-American sentiment" in various Latin American countries. He said that he often heard the following criticisms of the United States in Latin America: the U.S. government "is fundamentally concerned with making Latin America safe for American business, not for democracy. It supports dictators whom the people hate, and whitewashes them"; our (American) "businessmen care only about how much money they can make, and not about the country where they are, or its development"; the United States is responsible for the "low and fluctuating prices of copper, coffee, and other products" of Latin America.

Stevenson advocated stabilizing the prices of Latin America's export raw materials for the sake of the United States' own interests. According to the author, with the "development of American production," there is a "need for a larger market in Latin America to sell our goods."

In order to ease the dissatisfaction of various Latin American countries with U.S. economic plunder, Stevenson also advocated that U.S. companies should be "integrated" with the national economies of Latin American countries, that is, absorb some local capital to participate in U.S. enterprises, and use the name of joint ventures to appease and deceive the people of Latin America. He believes that in this way, "their (U.S. companies') development would be welcomed, and would no longer arouse nationalist" sentiments.

    史蒂文森发表文章承认
    拉丁美洲反对美国掠夺
    据新华社10日讯　美国民主党前总统候选人史蒂文森在11月22日的美国《展望》杂志上发表题为《我们在拉丁美洲的处境》的文章承认，在他访问拉丁美洲期间，他发现拉丁美洲各国存在着“反美情绪”。他说，他在拉丁美洲经常听到的对美国的批评有：美国政府“根本关心的是使拉丁美洲对美国企业来说是安全的，而不是对民主来说是安全的。它支持人民所憎恨的独裁者，并且替他们涂脂抹粉”；我们（美国）的“企业家只关心他们能赚多少钱，而不关心所在的国家及其发展”；美国应对拉丁美洲的“铜、咖啡和其他产品价格低廉及价格波动”负责。
    史蒂文森主张为了美国本身的利益，应该稳定拉丁美洲的出口原料价格。据作者认为，随着美国“生产的发展”，“需要在拉丁美洲有更大的市场来销售我们的货物”。
    为了缓和拉丁美洲各国对美国经济掠夺的不满，史蒂文森还鼓吹美国公司同拉丁美洲各国的国民经济“合在一起”，也就是说，吸收当地一部分资本参加美国企业，在合营的名义下对拉丁美洲人民进行怀柔和欺骗。他认为，这样一来，“它们（美国公司）的发展就会受欢迎，而不会再引起民族主义”的情绪。
