    Compactor is very useful
    Hope to arrange production as soon as possible
    According to the experience of Handan city in recent years, the micro compactor is very useful. It is driven by tractors or livestock, and can not only crush soil clods and conserve water, but also is an indispensable weapon for spring plowing. It can also be used for rolling wheat and threshing in summer harvesting. A tractor pulling a group of compactors can thresh 200,000 jin per day, which is ten times more efficient than a thresher. It can solve the contradiction of busy summer harvesting and insufficient labor and animal power.
    It is suggested that the relevant departments arrange the production of compactors as soon as possible, so as to supply the needs of spring plowing and water conservation and wheat harvesting and threshing in time.

    镇压器用处大
    希望及早安排生产
    根据邯郸市几年来的经验，微形镇压器用处很大，它由拖拉机或牲畜带动，不但能碾碎土块，蓄水保墒，是春耕整地不可缺少的武器；它还可以在夏收中用来轧麦打场，一台拖拉机牵引一组镇压器，一天可以轧场脱粒二十万斤，比一台脱谷机工效高十倍，可以解决夏收农活繁忙劳畜力不足的矛盾。
    建议有关部门对镇压器及早安排生产，以便及时供应春耕保墒和麦收打场的需要。
