Xinhua News Agency, Guayaquil, December 1st: The Ecuadorian people oppose the government's adoption of a unified exchange rate between the Ecuadorian and U.S. currencies, which is detrimental to the national economy. Ecuadorian Minister of Economy, José Cevallos, stated on November 28th that he had decided to adopt this measure.

It is reported that the unified exchange rate announced by the Minister of Economy was pre-approved by a U.S. delegation and the U.S.-controlled International Monetary Fund, and the decision was made secretly. It is believed that this is the government's submission to the will of U.S. imperialism and the oligarchy directly connected to it.

The government's decision to implement a unified exchange rate has been opposed by national industrialists and businessmen, the Mountainous Region Agricultural Association, the Industrialists Association, and the Chamber of Commerce. The Ecuadorian Communist Party has issued a statement calling on people of all strata to be vigilant against the government's new offensive and to wage a resolute struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, Lima: Peruvian Senator Pedro Martinto condemned the American-funded Marcona Mining Company for evading taxes.

In his speech in the Senate, Martinto pointed out that this American company, which mines iron ore in Nazca in southern Peru, extracts more than 2.5 million tons of iron ore annually, but in the past ten years it has only paid 749,964 soles in taxes, evading as much as 11,199,640 soles. Senator Martinto also condemned the tax authorities for dereliction of duty, which allowed the American-funded company to evade taxes.

Xinhua News Agency, Rio de Janeiro: The Vice President of the Rio de Janeiro Chamber of Commerce, Meneses, criticized the policy of economic plunder pursued by the United States against Latin American countries at a recent meeting of the Chamber of Commerce's leadership.

According to a report in the *Correio da Manhã* on November 26, Meneses said that the United States single-mindedly pursues profits and relies on its extremely strong financial power to control the entire economic system of Latin America. On the price lists of the U.S. food exchanges, the prices of Latin America's main export products are always the lowest. At the same time, the U.S. Export-Import Bank encourages these countries to rely on credit to purchase more American-made products. The International Monetary Fund then forcibly imposes economic and exchange rate measures on these countries, subjecting the products that help their balance of payments to international speculation.

    新华社1日讯　瓜亚基尔消息：厄瓜多尔人民反对政府采取有损民族经济的厄美货币统一兑换率。厄瓜多尔经济部长何塞·塞瓦略斯在11月28日曾经表示，他已经决定采取这一措施。
    据报道，经济部长宣布要采取的统一兑换率是预先由美国代表团和由美国控制的国际货币基金组织通过的，并且是以秘密方式作出这项决定的。人们认为，这是政府对美帝国主义以及同它有直接联系的寡头阶层的意旨的屈从。
    政府决定实行统一兑换率的作法遭到了民族工商业者、山区的农业家协会、工业家协会和商会的反对。厄瓜多尔共产党为此发表了一项声明，号召各阶层人民对政府的新的进攻保持警惕，并且进行坚决的斗争。
    据新华社利马电　秘鲁参议员佩德罗·马廷托谴责美资马科纳采矿公司逃避税收。
    马廷托在参议院的发言中指出，美国这家在秘鲁南部纳斯卡开采铁矿的公司每年开采二百五十多万吨铁矿石，但它在最近十年中只交纳了七十四万九千九百六十四索尔的税收，漏交的税收多达一千一百九十九万六千四百索尔。参议员马廷托还谴责税收机关失责，使美资公司得以漏税。
    据新华社里约热内卢电　里约热内卢商会副会长孟泽斯在最近举行的商会领导机构的会议上批评美国对拉丁美洲国家奉行的经济掠夺政策。
    据《晨邮报》11月26日报道，孟泽斯说，美国一味追逐利润，凭恃自己的极其强大的财政力量控制拉丁美洲的整个经济系统。在美国食品交易所的牌价上，拉丁美洲的主要出口产品的价格总是最低的。同时美国进出口银行促使这些国家靠信贷购买更多的美国制成品。而国际货币基金组织又强行对这些国家规定经济和汇兑方面的办法，使这些国家的有助于自己的支付平衡的产品受到国际规模的投机之害。
