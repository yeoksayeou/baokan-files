    Be Good at Summarizing Experience

    Constantly summarizing work is an important method for continuously improving leadership and enterprise management levels. Since the Great Leap Forward, workers have created many valuable experiences, which are precious assets for building socialism at high speed. Timely summarizing and applying these experiences will play a huge promoting role in ensuring the completion of this year's production plan and achieving a continuous leap forward next year.

    Constantly summarizing work is an important working method to gradually develop perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge, and to further understand and master objective laws. The Chongqing Water Transport Company encountered an unprecedentedly low water level last winter and this spring, the lowest in twenty-three years. In order to ensure the supply of raw materials such as steel, coking coal, and ore, all employees, with the heroic spirit of making the low water bow its head and the reefs give way, fought against the low water and shoals, and finally overcame this difficulty and achieved victory. In order to further consolidate and develop this victory, before the arrival of the low water this year, they mobilized the masses to conduct a systematic summary of the experience of overcoming the low water last winter and this spring, developing perceptual knowledge into rational knowledge. And they used it to guide the struggle against low water this winter and next spring. In this way, they further mastered the laws of fighting low water and promoted the continuous Great Leap Forward in water transport. In our various factories and mining enterprises, the vast number of employees have created many experiences in the struggle for production. We must be good at constantly summarizing the masses' experience in struggle. Through summarizing work, we can further improve the theoretical and policy levels of cadres, better lead the masses, and achieve a continuous leap forward with the best methods and the least manpower and material resources.

    To be good at summarizing the rich experience in production and truly exert its effectiveness in production, first of all, leading cadres must steadfastly base themselves on the reality of production and have a deep understanding of production. The regularity of production is often hidden behind the complex surface of things and cannot be seen through at a glance. A down-to-earth work style is the primary condition for understanding the reality of production and mastering the laws of production. Without a down-to-earth and hard-working style and without the spirit of being willing to be a pupil, one cannot summarize work well.

    To summarize experience well, it is also necessary to fully mobilize the masses, carry out mass movements on a large scale, and adhere to the leadership method of "from the masses, to the masses." Experience is the crystallization of the labor and wisdom of the broad masses, and only by mobilizing the broad masses to summarize it themselves can it be concentrated, adhered to, and better implemented among the broad masses. At the same time, the process of mobilizing the masses to summarize work is also a process of continuously improving the political and ideological awareness and technical level of the masses. This is a very good living teaching material for us to carry out political and ideological work among the broad masses, and it is also an important part of our production preparation work for next year.

### 要善于总结经验

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    要善于总结经验
    不断总结工作，是不断提高领导水平和企业管理水平的一个重要方法。大跃进以来，职工们创造了许多宝贵经验，这都是高速度建设社会主义的宝贵财富。把这些经验及时地加以总结和运用，对于保证完成今年的生产计划和实现明年的持续跃进，必将起巨大的推动作用。
    不断地总结工作，是使感性认识逐步发展到理性认识，进一步认识和掌握客观规律的一项重要工作方法。重庆市水上运输公司在去冬今春遇到了二十三年来所罕见的特大枯水位，为了保证钢、煤焦、矿石等原材料的供应，全体职工以要枯水低头，礁石让路的英雄气概，大战枯水、浅滩，终于战胜了这一困难，取得了胜利。为了进一步巩固和发展这一胜利，今年当枯水到来之前，他们又发动群众对去冬今春战胜枯水的经验进行了系统的总结，将感性认识发展到理性认识。并运用来指导今冬明春的枯水斗争。这样就进一步掌握了和枯水斗争的规律，促进了水上运输持续大跃进。在我们各个厂矿企业中，广大职工在生产斗争中所创造的经验是很多的，我们必须善于经常总结群众的斗争经验，通过总结工作，进一步提高干部的理论水平和政策水平，更好地领导群众，以最好的办法，最少的人力和物力实现持续跃进。
    要善于总结生产中的丰富经验，并真正在生产中发挥效用，首先领导干部要踏踏实实地立足于生产实际，对生产深知深解。生产的规律性，常常是隐蔽在复杂的事物表面的背后，不是一眼就能看透的。踏踏实实的工作作风，则是认识生产实际，掌握生产规律的首要条件。没有踏踏实实埋头苦干的工作作风，没有甘当小学生的精神，是不能把工作总结好的。
    要总结好经验，还必须充分发动群众，大搞群众运动，坚持贯彻“从群众中来，到群众中去”的领导方法。经验是广大群众劳动和智慧的结晶，也只有通过发动广大群众自己起来进行总结，才能集中起来，坚持下去，更好地贯彻到广大群众中去。同时，发动群众总结工作的过程，也就是不断提高群众政治思想觉悟和技术水平的过程。这是我们对广大群众进行政治思想工作的一个很好的活教材，也是我们对于明年的生产准备工作中的一项重要内容。
