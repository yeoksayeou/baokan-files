    Shanxi Province Actively Expands Winter Irrigation Area
    Shandong's Forty Counties and Cities Begin Winter Irrigation

    (Xinhua News Agency report) People's communes in various parts of Shanxi Province are making full use of existing water conservancy facilities to actively expand the area of winter irrigation. The province's autumn and winter irrigated area has reached more than 1,150,000 mu, of which more than 435,000 mu are winter-irrigated wheat fields.

    This year, Shanxi Province has experienced prolonged drought, and the water volume of various rivers has generally decreased, and the groundwater level has dropped. However, because various reservoirs closed their gates for water storage in advance based on weather forecasts, they have still stored water for winter irrigation this year and spring irrigation next year. In order to fully tap the potential of existing water sources, all river systems in the province have released water for winter irrigation ahead of schedule. The nine irrigation districts under the Sanggan River Administration Bureau in northern Shanxi began releasing water in early October, ten to fifteen days earlier than in previous years.

    In this year's winter irrigation, all localities have been leveling and preparing fields and building canals as early as possible, and have promoted a planned water use method of allocating water per mu, thereby saving water consumption per unit area, speeding up the progress of irrigation, and expanding the area of irrigation.

    (Xinhua News Agency report) Since late November, some communes and production teams in forty counties and cities in Shandong Province have successively started winter irrigation activities.

    Counties and communes in Shandong Province have conducted a thorough investigation of the water conservancy projects, irrigation areas, and labor force, formulated feasible winter irrigation plans, and organized forces to repair and irrigate simultaneously. In the Zibo area's Dayuzhang Irrigation Area, the canals and wheat fields were first sorted out one by one, and the canals that did not need to be cleaned, those that needed to be dredged, those that needed to be repaired, wheat fields with low moisture content, wheat fields with salinization, and wheat that needed early watering were analyzed. Thus a detailed winter irrigation plan was formulated to fully utilize the Yellow River water diversion irrigation of the Dayuzhang project. As of the beginning of December, the irrigation area has irrigated 183,000 mu of wheat, 21,000 mu of autumn vegetables, 70,000 mu of uncultivated land, and 9,400 mu for alkali leaching, completing more than 80% of the irrigation plan.

    In winter irrigation, areas with suitable conditions have achieved a complete set of water conservancy projects, and have paid attention to the installation and maintenance of drainage and irrigation machinery. Before winter irrigation, the Lao Zhao Zhuang Commune in Linqing City organized special personnel to repair the drainage and irrigation machinery, and fixed the machinery for the use and management of brigades and teams, thereby strengthening the maintenance of the machinery and reducing losses. The commune's 36,300 mu of wheat this year has now been irrigated by nearly 30,000 mu.

### 山西积极扩大冬灌面积  山东四十个县市开始冬灌

    山西积极扩大冬灌面积
    山东四十个县市开始冬灌
    据新华社讯　山西省各地人民公社充分运用现有各项水利设施，积极扩大冬灌面积。全省秋冬灌溉面积已达一百一十五万多亩，其中冬灌麦田四十三万五千多亩。
    今年山西省长期干旱，各河水量普遍减少，井水水位下降。但由于各个水库根据天气预报，提前关闸蓄水，仍旧为今年冬灌和明年春灌贮备了水源。为了充分挖掘现有水源潜力，全省各河系灌区都提前放水冬灌。晋北桑干河管理局所属的九个灌区，都在10月上旬放水，比往年提早十天到半个月。
    在今年冬灌中，各地都是及早平田整地，修建渠道，并且推行按亩配水的计划用水方法，因而节省了单位面积用水量，加快了浇地进度，扩大了浇地面积。
    据新华社讯　山东省各地自11月下旬以来，已有四十个县市的部分公社、生产队先后开始了冬灌活动。
    山东省各县、社对水利工程、灌区和劳力的情况进行了摸底排队，制定了切实可行的冬灌计划，并组织力量边整修、边灌溉。淄博专区打渔张灌区，首先对渠道、麦田逐一进行了排队，分析了哪些沟渠不用清理，哪些需要清淤，哪些需要补缺，以及哪些麦田含水量低，哪些有发碱现象，哪些小麦需要早浇水，从而制定了详细的冬灌计划，充分利用打渔张工程引黄灌溉。到12月上旬止，这个灌区已浇小麦十八万三千亩、秋菜二万一千亩、白茬地七万亩、洗碱九千四百亩，完成了浇地计划的80％以上。
    在冬灌中，有条件的地区作到水利工程配套，并且注意排灌机具的安装、检修工作。临清市老赵庄公社在冬灌前组织专人检修排灌机械，并将机械固定给大队、小队管理和使用，因而加强了机械的维修，减少了损耗。全公社今年种的三万六千三百亩小麦，现已灌溉了近三万亩。
