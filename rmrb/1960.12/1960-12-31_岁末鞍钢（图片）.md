    Anshan Iron and Steel at Year's End
    Caption
    The year-end competition at Anshan Iron and Steel Company has reached another climax. The broad masses of workers are striving to produce more high-quality steel in the final moments of completing the annual plan.

    Steelworkers have shortened the melting time for each furnace by another 10 to 20 minutes compared to the average for the entire month of November, and the daily steel output has increased by 4.9% compared to the average for the entire month of November. Ironworkers have launched a communist collaboration pact competition to ensure that whatever type of steel the steel plant needs, they will supply high-quality molten iron. Workers in the mining and transportation departments are also battling the severe cold with soaring enthusiasm, doing everything possible to improve the operating rate of equipment, so that transportation and raw materials closely keep up with the pace of steel production.
    Xinhua News Agency reporters Miao Ming, Li Changgui, and Yao Fucai photographed the following:

Second from the left is steelmaking expert Li Shaokui, third from the left is "Five-Good Furnace" furnace chief Gao Wenli, and first from the right is youth leap furnace chief Feng Zhitai.

    Each steelmaking plant has drawn experienced veteran workers, technicians, and leading cadres to form furnace body maintenance inspection teams, regularly conducting meticulous maintenance on the furnace body to ensure rapid steelmaking. Workers from the furnace maintenance team of the First Steelmaking Plant are maintaining a furnace.
    Since the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant launched the team collaboration pact competition, it has greatly promoted the collectivist thinking and communist style of the workers, truly establishing the relationship between people and between furnaces on the ideological foundation of communist large-scale collaboration, resulting in a "one place in trouble, all parties support" atmosphere. Workers from each furnace are helping the No. 4 blast furnace to handle slag tap.
    The No. 41 electric pick of the Dagusan Iron Mine, which won the national red banner of excellence, is quickly loading ore.

    岁末鞍钢
    图片说明
    鞍山钢铁公司岁末竞赛再起高潮，广大职工力争在完成全年计划的最后时刻，炼出更多好钢。
    炼钢工人使每炉钢的熔炼时间又比11月份全月平均缩短十到二十分钟，钢的日产量比11月份全月平均增长4.9％。炼铁工人开展了共产主义协作公约竞赛，保证作到炼钢厂炼什么样的钢，就供给什么样的优质铁水。矿山和运输部门的职工，也以冲天干劲和严寒搏斗，千方百计提高设备的作业率，使运输和原料紧紧跟上钢铁生产的脚步。

    快速炼钢一炉接着一炉，铸锭车间钢花闪闪
    各炼钢厂抽出护炉有经验的老工人、技术人员和领导干部，组成炉体维护检查组，经常对炉体进行细致的维修，保证了快速炼钢。第一炼钢厂护炉组工人正在护炉
    鞍钢炼铁厂开展班组协作公约竞赛以后，大大发扬了职工的集体主义思想和共产主义风格，使人与人、炉与炉之间的关系真正建立在共产主义大协作的思想基础上，出现了“一处有事、各方支援”的气象。各炉工人正在帮助四高炉处理渣口
