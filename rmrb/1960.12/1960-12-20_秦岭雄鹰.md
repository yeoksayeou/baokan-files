    Qinling Eagle
    Liu Ye
    In the early winter weather, the Qinling Mountains are still green and orange, but the distant mountain peaks are surrounded by clusters of vast fog. The morning sun shines on the white frost on the mountain slopes. An eagle circles and soars among the towering mountains, its two wide and powerful wings spread open, freely rotating, as if the thousands of mountains and valleys are within its embrace. Suddenly, it dips down into the deep valley, and in the blink of an eye, it soars into the air again. You look up, your eyes fixed on its graceful figure, and you feel a surge of flying power, and your thoughts are carried into a vast world. People say that there are many eagles like this in the Qinling Mountains. Whether it's the raging wind and rain scouring the chest of the Qinling Mountains, or the overwhelming snow rolling over the top of the Qinling Mountains, the more severe the days, the higher and more fiercely the eagles fly.
    However, in the Qinling Mountains, the more heroic and agile eagles are the heroic mountain builders.
    One day, at noon, I was standing on the Jialing River in Lueyang County, listening to the roaring sounds of mountain blasting. When I looked up, I saw a person on the opposite hillside walking towards the county town with excitement. He wore a sheepskin coat with the long fur collar turned up on his shoulders, his hat pushed high on his head, and his hands pulling the coat behind his back. He walked with a vigorous and powerful bounce, and soon rushed down the hillside. This scene immediately reminded me of the eagles on the Qinling peaks.
    "Isn't that County Chief Wang?" someone shouted.
    County Chief Wang is Wang Shijun. Last night, Secretary Ren of the county party committee introduced us to the situation of Lueyang's vigorous development of agriculture and grain. Before he could say three words, he turned the topic to Comrade Wang Shijun. "Our county is carrying out a 'Learn from Guo Town, catch up with Guo Town, everyone learn from Wang Shijun' campaign." Secretary Ren is a modest person, but when he talked about Wang Shijun, a kind of irrepressible pride appeared on his face. "Old Wang is a shrewd and capable comrade. He resolutely and bravely implements the party's tasks, without any ambiguity. He does everything in a down-to-earth manner, saying one is one, and saying two is two, without anything he can't accomplish. I understand this. We are from the same village in Shanxi, less than thirty miles apart. Old Wang worked as a farmhand since he was a child, and joined the militia early on, serving as a militia captain. When fighting the enemy, he always rushed to the front, and he is the same in construction. In 1949, the party sent us to the Qinling Mountains, and Old Wang always picked the heaviest burden and the hardest work, specializing in dealing with difficulties. Last spring, Old Wang was transferred to Lueyang as deputy county chief and first secretary of the Guo Town Commune Party Committee. Do you know what? Guo Town Commune is a high and cold mountainous area! The difficulties there are as numerous as the cogon grass all over the mountains. The land is barren and the population is sparse, the frost-free period is short, and there are mountains upon mountains everywhere, and grain production has always been backward. It is not easy to shoulder such a burden, but Old Wang's shoulders are strong! That day, he came to Lueyang from Baocheng. We talked about the situation in Guo Town. Before he could even sit down, he picked up his backpack and started to leave. It's a hundred and twenty miles of mountain road from Lueyang City to Guo Town! I said, 'Old Wang! What's the rush? Rest for two days before you go!' He grinned and said, 'The planting season is coming soon!' You see, that's the kind of person he is. Old Wang brought the party's policies to the high mountains and to the masses. In less than two years, the face of Guo Town has changed greatly. Last year, despite abnormal natural conditions, total grain output still increased sharply. This year, even more unfavorable climatic conditions were encountered, but the grain output of Guo Town Commune increased again compared to last year. At the beginning of last year, there were only eight hundred pigs, but now there are more than seven thousand. The members of the Guo Town Commune have also composed a song, singing: 'Five grains are abundant, six animals are thriving, and the four mountains and peaks are all singing'..." Secretary Ren paused after saying this in one breath. He thought for a while and added: "He is truly a red banner for building mountainous areas!" He poked the fire pot in front of him, and the charcoal in the pot crackled for a while, emitting bursts of flames. Whether it was because Secretary Ren was excited by the conversation or because the charcoal fire was hot, people's faces were flushed.
    Comrade Wang Shijun is such a person: as long as you talk to him for a few hours, you will never forget that he has a kind of soaring vitality, a kind and enthusiastic demeanor. When he speaks, it's like a burst of carbine fire, and every word is hot to the heart. However, it wasn't always like this at the beginning. You ask him, how did the miracle of Guo Town Commune come about? He shyly refuses to answer, always saying, "It's nothing, it's nothing." Or, he makes the many hardships and difficulties sound particularly easy: "The work is very easy to do! Just do what the party tells us to do. With the party's leadership and the organization of the people's commune, we can put in more effort and use our brains more, and we can dig out the roots of poverty one by one." But, you will know how much hard work it takes to dig out the roots of poverty, and how much thought it takes!
    Wang Shijun can be regarded as a strong and optimistic person. In the years of war, he never frowned when fighting the enemy; but when he first arrived in Guo Town, he frowned. Here, the mountains are high and the slopes are steep with little flat land, overgrown with weeds, and it's hard to see much cultivated land. It was already the planting season, but there were still few people working in the fields. People welcomed Wang Shijun's arrival in Guo Town, but some also gossiped, "Wang Shijun doesn't have three heads and six arms!" "Guo Town will always be backward, and even immortals can't change it!"... Wang Shijun was confident: "Wealth doesn't fall from the sky, and poverty isn't born from the earth. As long as we resolutely implement the party's general line, rely on the people's commune, and mobilize the masses to work hard, crops can grow wherever there is land." But, it is necessary to make everyone think that way! So, Wang Shijun explained the party's policies to everyone one by one. The commune party committee launched a debate among all cadres and members: "Should we be the masters of nature or willingly be slaves of nature? How to overcome disasters? How to consolidate and develop the people's commune? Where are the roots of poverty and backwardness?..." These questions were like a string of stones thrown into calm water, stirring up rolling waves. People argued and planned, and gradually, the party's policies illuminated people's hearts, and a huge force was transmitted from Wang Shijun to many cadres and members. But, in those days, one question was swirling in Wang Shijun's heart more than anyone else's: "Where is the key to increasing grain production?" He couldn't eat or sleep, and wandered around in the mountains all day long, climbing from this mountain to that mountain, from this production team to that production team, from this member's home to that member's home, seeking advice from cadres and the masses. How much land is there in Guo Town? What crops to plant? How high is the yield? How can we get more grain? And so on. Some people said, "The problems are all obvious, why are you running around?" But Wang Shijun said, "There are big fish in deep water! How can you do it without going to the masses?" Sure enough, Wang Shijun found the key to increasing production among the masses.
    Some members said to him: "County Chief Wang, we must plant more in this high mountain field! The older generation often said, 'Plant a sock to get a shoe, if you don't plant it, where will it come from?' Look, some land is barren, and just planting 'high-yield' is not enough!"
    Some members said: "To get rich, crops should open a grocery store."
    "If you plant more, you don't harvest summer grain but you harvest autumn grain, you don't harvest main grain but you harvest miscellaneous grain, you don't harvest high mountain but you harvest river valley, what's there to worry about increasing grain production?"
    These words made Wang Shijun feel enlightened. He thought: "We must plant more! Expand the planting area, we can't just engage in 'less planting and high yield', we must both achieve high yield and high harvest, and also plant more and harvest more, walking on two legs, isn't that how the party's policies are stipulated? The party and the masses have come to the same conclusion." So, seeds were sown on the mountains and down the mountains, in the plains and river dams. In order to solve the seed problem, Wang Shijun traveled over mountains and rivers to the neighboring area of Dananyu in Gansu to make contact. During the busy planting season, Wang Shijun labored with the members in the high mountains during the day, and slept back-to-back with the members under the stone cliffs at night. In this way, the entire commune expanded its planting by more than 21,000 mu last year, and also cultivated more than 1,800 mu of scattered land, even a palm-sized area was buried with seeds. In the autumn, golden queen, Bashan beans... matured all over the mountains, and Guo Town Commune achieved its first harvest in history.
    Afterwards, Wang Shijun made a summary of the issue of increasing grain production. I have seen that material in the Lueyang County Party Committee. Several items are listed above: 1. Expand planting; 2. Vigorously engage in intercropping; 3. Plant more high-yield crops; 4. Increase varieties in accordance with local conditions and seasons... It seems that these experiences are unremarkable, but if you look closely at the content inside, or ask Wang Shijun to give an introduction, you will be moved by those vivid facts. For example, the natural conditions of the mountainous areas, such as soil layer, slope, height, temperature, sunshine, soil quality, and rainfall, vary greatly, and almost every piece of land has different characteristics. How to grasp these characteristics to defeat the enemies of nature? Wang Shijun will tell you everything in detail: what should be planted on the high mountains? What should be planted in the river dams? When to plant? When to harvest? "Just talking about the planting season, corn is planted from the bottom of the mountain to the top: river dams are planted before Grain Rain, mid-mountains are planted before Start of Summer, and high mountains are planted before Grain Full; wheat is planted from the top of the mountain to the bottom: high mountains are planted during White Dew, mid-mountains are planted during Autumn Equinox, and river dams are planted during Cold Dew..." Wang Shijun recited his abundant grain production experience like reciting beautiful verses. For a person who is not familiar with agricultural production, after hearing these, they will understand that there is such a tortuous and complex struggle between man and nature, and in this struggle, man's intelligence and courage are so firmly exercised.
    If you don't believe it, please listen to a story Wang Shijun told about Golden Queen coming down the mountain:
    "Last year, our commune's Golden Queen came down the mountain!" That night, we sat around together, and Wang Shijun took two strong puffs of dry tobacco and said:
      "Golden Queen, what a good variety! One stalk carries a 'baby', which weighs about a pound. Other varieties, like 'spotted corn' and 'chicken claw', can't compare to it. But when I first came to Guo Town, the masses here didn't like it. And they composed a folk song saying: 'Mention Golden Queen, it makes people want to vomit, climbed several mountains, and still carried an empty basket'.
    "I thought: 'What grievances does Golden Queen have with the folks here? Why don't they like Golden Queen?' The masses said 'Climbed several mountains, and still carried an empty basket', and I thought, why did they say climbed several 'mountains', and not walked several 'rivers'? This reveals a 'secret', that is, the harvest planted in the high mountains is indeed not good. Feng Xiuying's Golden Queen can harvest a thousand catties, because it is planted in the river dam.
    "I studied together with the cadres and members, and the reasons were found. That is because Golden Queen is suitable for planting in the river dams, and not suitable for planting in the high mountains. Golden Queen has tall stalks and deep roots, it requires fertile soil, sufficient sunshine, and thick soil layers. In the high mountains, it is cold and barren, and a hoe can hit a stone, so Golden Queen will naturally only grow stalks and not carry 'babies'. Therefore, we decided: Golden Queen comes down the mountain. This year, the masses are singing again. How are they singing?" Wang Shijun turned around and asked a comrade from Guo Town Commune who came with him.
    "The masses are singing like this: Mention Golden Queen, it makes people happy, the same piece of land, harvests several more baskets." The comrade replied.
    "Yes! Golden Queen has had a bumper harvest, how can the masses not be happy?" Wang Shijun stopped, took two more puffs of tobacco, and said meaningfully:
    "To grow crops, you have to work hard. You have to understand the temper of every mountain, every ridge, every slope, and every piece of land. The masses say: 'One zhang higher, it's different', this is adapting to local conditions, one key opens one lock!"
    We listened in a daze. We wanted to ask Wang Shijun to tell us more stories about his vigorous grain production. We heard that there are many such stories, such as the "Ten Thousand Mu Buckwheat Movement"! "Potatoes Go Up the Mountain"! These are all deeds of Wang Shijun concentrating the wisdom of the masses and trying every means to increase grain production. But, Wang Shijun smiled and said his old saying again, "It's nothing, it's nothing!"
    Early the next morning, we got up and went to Guo Town.
    Walking upstream along the Jialing River, then turning a few bends in the mountains along a deep valley, and then crossing a few mountains, ahead is Lesu River. Guo Town is like a pearl tied to the long belt of Lesu River. We walked and looked on the road, as if entering a natural park. The leaves of the green oak trees all over the mountains have turned yellow, the maple trees are as red as a ball of fire, and strings of golden bell-like fruits hang on the persimmon trees. The green wheat seedlings all over the hillside grow densely and vigorously. This scene stunned us. Could this be the high and cold mountainous area that is said to be "nine harvests out of ten years" and poor and backward? I was wondering, when there was a burst of quacking sounds in front of me. Looking up, it turned out to be a large group of ducks moving like a white cloud on the mountain road. Wang Shijun greeted the duck herders.
    "How many days have you been walking?"
    "More than ten days."
    "None of them are sick, are they?"
    "No. Don't look at them waddling, they are not simple when they walk! On this long march, many ducks have blisters on their feet, but look, none of them are willing to fall behind?"
    It turned out that these more than two thousand ducks were new "residents" of Guo Town Commune. Guo Town has never had ducks before. This spring, Wang Shijun traveled hundreds of miles to Hanzhong City to reserve these ducks. A few days ago, Guo Town Commune specially sent people to pick them up. It was inconvenient to transport them by car on the mountain roads, so they came on foot over a long distance.
    We climbed up another hillside, and below the hillside was Guo Town. Wang Shijun narrowed his eyes with excitement, waving his arms non-stop, pointing here and there, telling me:
  "Look! The rows of houses in the west valley are our pig farms, and the high chimneys over there are the iron and steel plant and the paper mill... And, do you see that?" Wang Shijun raised his finger and pointed to the tallest and largest row of tile houses, raising his voice and said: "That is our grain warehouse! Guo Town has never had a grain warehouse in history, but today it has one, and more and bigger granaries will be built in the future!"
    As we listened, we were fascinated. This day was a rare good day in the Qinling Mountains. Looking up, we saw the eagles flying high in the mountains again. So agile, so brave, thousands of mountains are not in sight. Qinling eagles! Fly high! The sky of our motherland allows you to fly freely! (Attached picture)

    秦岭雄鹰
    刘野
    初冬天气，秦岭的山头却还是青橙橙的，只是远处的高山顶上缭绕着一团团茫茫的雾气，早晨的阳光闪亮着山坡上白晃晃的霜花。在丛山峻岭之间盘旋翱翔的雄鹰，张开两扇宽大有力的翅膀，自由自在地旋转着，好像千山万壑尽在它的环抱之中。猛然间，一斜身子向着深谷里沉下去，转眼工夫，又腾空而起了。你抬头目不转睛地随着它翩翩的英姿望着，感到增添了一股飞翔的力量，思想也被带进一个广阔的天地里去了。人们说，秦岭山区这样的鹰很多，无论是狂风暴雨冲刷着秦岭的胸膛，无论是盖天盖地的大雪滚过秦岭的头顶，越是在严峻的日子里，雄鹰也就越加飞得高，飞得猛。
    然而，在秦岭山区，更加英勇，更加矫健的雄鹰却是那些英雄的山区建设者。
    一天，正是中午时分，我站在略阳县的嘉陵江边上倾听着轰隆轰隆开山的声响，一抬头，迎面山坡上有一个人兴冲冲地朝县城走来。他披了一件羊皮大衣，长毛领子翻在肩上，头上的帽子向后推得高高的，两手把大衣向背后一挑，走起路来一窜一窜的那么雄健有力，一会就冲下山坡来了。这情景，使我一下子就联想起了秦岭山峰上的雄鹰。
    “那不是王县长吗？”谁这么喊了一声。
    王县长就是王世俊。昨天夜里，县委任书记向我们介绍略阳大办农业、大办粮食的情况，没有说上三言五语，就把话题转到王世俊同志身上来了。“我们全县正在开展一个‘学郭镇，赶郭镇，人人都学王世俊’的运动呢。”任书记是个谦逊的人，可是说起王世俊，他脸上流露出一种抑止不住的自豪感。“老王是个精明能干的同志，执行党的任务坚决勇敢，一点也不含糊，办任何事情都是踏踏实实的，说一是一，说二是二，没有个办不成功。这一点我是了解的。我们是山西同乡，村子相隔不到三十里。老王从小扛长工，很早就参加了民兵，当民兵队长，和敌人打起仗来都是猛打猛冲地跑在前头，搞建设也是这样。1949年，党把我们派到秦岭山区来，老王总是担子拣重的挑，工作找硬的干，专门和困难打交道。去年春上，老王被调到略阳来当副县长兼郭镇公社的党委第一书记。你知道不？郭镇公社可是个高寒山区啊！那里的困难多得就和漫山遍野的茅草一样。地薄人稀，无霜期短，到处是重重叠叠的大山，粮食生产一直落后。挑这么一副担子，可不轻，但是老王的肩膀硬！那天，他从褒城刚来略阳，我们谈了谈郭镇的情况，他屁股还没有坐稳，背起背包拔脚就要走。从略阳城到郭镇足有一百二十里山路啊！我说：‘老王呀！急什么哩，休息两天再去吧！’他咧开嘴笑着说：‘播种期快过了！’你瞧，他就是这样的人。老王把党的政策带到高山上去，带到群众中去，不到两年，郭镇的面貌大变样了。去年在自然条件不正常的情况下，粮食总产量还是猛增，今年呢，遇到了更加不利的气候条件，可是郭镇公社的粮食产量又较去年增加了。去年年初，生猪才有八百多头，现在已经有七千多头了。郭镇公社的社员们还编了一首歌呢，他们唱着：‘五谷丰登六畜旺，四山群峰都在唱’……”任书记一口气说到这里停下了，他想了想，加了一句：“他真是建设山区的一面红旗！”他拨弄了一下面前的火盆，盆里的木炭噼噼啪啪地响了一阵，冒出了一股股的火苗。不知道是任书记的话谈得兴奋，还是炭火烤得发热，人们的脸上都泛着红光。
    王世俊同志是这样的人：你只要和他在一起谈上几个小时，就永远也不会忘记，他身上跳动着一种昂然的活力，神态亲切、热情，说起话来像连发的卡宾枪一样，每一句话都火辣辣地热到人的心坎里去。然而，开始并不是这样。你问他，郭镇公社的奇迹是怎样出现的？他腼腆地不肯同答，总说：“没啥，没啥。”要不，就把很多艰难困苦说得格外轻松：“工作好办得很！党叫怎么干就怎么干呗，有党的领导，有人民公社的组织，咱们多出点力气，多动点脑筋，一个个的穷根子就挖出来了。”可是，你会知道，把穷根子挖出来，要付出多少艰苦的努力，要花尽多少心思啊！
    王世俊算得上是个坚强而乐观的人。在战争年月里，和敌人斗争，他从来没有愁眉苦脸过；但刚到郭镇的时候，他可拧了眉梢子了。这里，山高坡陡平地少，到处杂草丛生，简直看不到多少耕地，已经是播种时节了，地里做活的人还稀稀拉拉。人们对于王世俊来郭镇是欢迎的，可也有人七嘴八舌地议论“王世俊没有三头六臂！”“郭镇一辈子落后，神仙也是改变不了的！”……王世俊胸中有数：“富裕不是天降的，贫穷不是地生的，只要坚决贯彻党的总路线，依靠人民公社，发动群众实打实地干，有土地的地方就能长出庄稼来。”但是，要使所有的人都这样想才行啊！于是王世俊把党的政策一条一条地讲给大家听，公社党委发动全体干部和社员展开了一场辩论：“应当做自然的主人还是甘做自然的奴隶？如何战胜灾荒？如何巩固和发展人民公社？贫困落后的根子在哪里？……”这些问题像一串串的石子投进平静的水中，激起滚滚的浪涛。人们争辩着、谋划着，渐渐地，党的政策照亮了人们的心，一股巨大的力量从王世俊身上又传送到许多干部和社员的身上去了。可是，那些日子，有一个问题在王世俊心里比谁都翻腾得厉害：“究竟增产粮食的关键在哪里？”他吃不下饭，睡不着觉，整天在山里转来转去，从这个山头翻上那个山头，从这个生产队走到那个生产队，从这个社员家里串到那个社员家里，向干部、向群众求谋问计。郭镇有多少土地？种什么庄稼？产量高低？怎样才能多打粮食？等等。有人说：“问题都明摆着呐，你到处跑什么？”可是王世俊说：“深水里有大鱼啊！不到群众中去怎么能行？”果然，王世俊在群众中找到增产的关键了。
    有的社员对他说：“王县长，咱这高山场地就得多种呀！老一辈的人常说‘种一袜子打一鞋，你不种它哪里来？’你看，有些地荒着，光种‘高产’不行哩！”
    有的社员说：“要得富，庄稼开个杂货铺。”
    “种得多了，夏粮不收秋粮收，主粮不收杂粮收，高山不收河川收，增产粮食还发什么愁？”
    这些话，使王世俊心里豁然开朗了。他想：“一定要多种！扩大播种面积，不能只是搞‘少种高产’，既要高产多收，又要多种多收，两条腿走路，党的政策不正是这样规定的吗？党和群众想到一条道上来了。”于是，在山上山下，在平川河坝，种籽撒下去了。为了解决种籽问题，王世俊跋山涉水地跑到甘肃邻区大南峪去联系。抢种的时节，王世俊在高山上白天和社员一起劳动，夜晚和社员背靠背地睡在石崖下。就这样，去年全公社扩种了二万一千多亩，还耕种了零星地一千八百多亩，就连一块巴掌大的地方也埋上种籽。到秋天，满山遍野的金皇后、巴山豆……成熟了，郭镇公社获得了历史上第一个丰收。
    事后，王世俊把增产粮食的问题作了一个总结。我在略阳县委看过那个材料。上面列出了好几条：一、扩大种植；二、大搞套种；三、多种高产作物；四、因地因时制宜增加品种……。看来，这些经验平淡无奇，可是，你仔细去看看里面的内容，或者请王世俊作个介绍，你就会被那些生动的事实所感动了。比如，山区的土层、坡度、高度、气温日晒、土质、雨水等自然条件千差万别，几乎每一块土地都有不同的特性，怎样掌握这些特点去打败自然界的敌人呢？王世俊会一五一十地告诉你：高山上应该种什么？河坝里应该种什么？什么时候种？什么时候收？“单就播种季节说，包谷是由山下往山上种：谷雨前种河坝，立夏前种半山，小满前种高山；小麦是由山上往山下种：白露种高山，秋分种半山，寒露种河坝……”王世俊像背诵美丽的诗句一样诉说着他大办粮食的丰产经验。对于一个不熟悉农业生产的人来说，听了这些才会明白，原来人和自然界之间存在着那么曲折复杂的斗争，而在这种斗争中又如此坚实地锻炼了人的聪明智慧和英勇无畏。
    你如不信，请再听一听王世俊讲的一个金皇后下山的故事：
    “去年，我们公社的金皇后下山啦！”那天夜里，我们围坐在一起，王世俊叭哒叭哒地用力吸了两口旱烟，说着：
      “金皇后，多好的品种啊！一根秆秆上背一个‘娃娃’，就是一斤来重，别的，像什么‘花包谷’‘野鸡爪’都顶不上它。可是我刚到郭镇来的时候，这里的群众并不喜欢它。而且编了一首歌谣说：‘提起金皇后，叫人把气呕，翻了几架山，还是空背斗’。
    “我心想：‘金皇后和这里的老乡有什么冤仇？为啥对金皇后看不上眼呢？群众说‘翻了几架山，还是空背斗’，我又想，为啥是翻了几架‘山’，而不是走了几道‘川’呢？这中间可道破了一个‘秘密’，那就是种在高山上的收成确实都不好。冯秀英种的金皇后能收一千斤，因为是种在河坝里。
    “我和干部、社员们共同研究，原因找出来了，就是因为金皇后适宜种河坝，不适宜种高山。金皇后秆高根深，要土地肥沃，日照充裕，土层厚实，高山上，天寒地薄，一镢头下去就能打在石头上，金皇后当然就光长秆子不背‘娃娃’了。所以，我们决定：金皇后下山。今年，群众又唱开了，他们是怎样唱的呢？”王世俊转过身来问旁边郭镇公社同来的一位同志。
    “群众这么唱：提起金皇后，叫人喜心头，同样一块地，多收几背斗。”那位同志回答。
    “是呀！金皇后丰收了，群众怎么能不喜心头呢？”王世俊停下来，又吸了两口烟，意味深长地说：
    “种庄稼，非实打实地干不行。每一架山，每一个梁，每一面坡，每一块土地，你都要摸透它的脾气。群众说：‘高一丈，不一样’，这就是因地制宜，一把钥匙开一把锁啊！”
    我们听得简直出神了。想要求王世俊再讲些他大办粮食生产的故事，我们听说这样的故事还多得很，什么“万亩荞运动”呀！“洋芋上山”呀！都是王世俊集中群众智慧，千方百计增产粮食的事迹。可是，王世俊嘿嘿一笑，又说起他那句“没啥，没啥！”的老话来了。
    第二天一大早，我们便起身到郭镇去了。
    沿着嘉陵江向上游走去，然后顺着一条深谷在万山丛中转上几个弯，再翻过几座大山，前面就是乐素河，郭镇像一颗珍珠系在乐素河这条长长的带子上。我们在路上走着看着，就像进入一个天然的公园一样。满山的青棡树林，叶子已经发黄了，枫树林红得像一团火，柿子树上还吊着一串一串金铃似的果子，满山坡上绿油油的麦苗长得密茂而又茁壮。这情景，使我们怔住了。难道这就是传说中“十年九不收”，贫困落后的高寒山区吗？我正诧异，前面传来一阵阵呱呱的叫声。抬头一看，原来是一大群鸭子像一片白云在山坡的路上飘动着。王世俊和赶鸭子的人打着招呼。
    “走了几天啦？”
    “十几天了。”
    “没有生病的吧？”
    “没有。你别看它们一扭一扭的，走起路来可不简单啊！这次长征，许多鸭子的脚掌板都打泡了，可是你瞧，谁也不肯掉队呢？”
    原来，这二千多只鸭子是郭镇公社的新“居民”。郭镇是从来没有过鸭子的。今年春天，王世俊跑了几百里路到汉中市预订了这些鸭子，前些天郭镇公社特地派了人去接它们，山路车运不方便，它们就长途跋涉走着来了。
    我们又爬上一个山坡，山坡下面就是郭镇了。王世俊兴奋得眯细了眼睛，两只手臂不停地挥舞着，指指这边，又指指那边，告诉我：
  “你瞧！西边山沟里的一排排房子是我们的猪场，那边的高烟囱是炼铁厂、造纸厂……还有，你看见了吗？”王世俊举起手指着那一排最高最大的瓦房，提高声音说：“那就是我们的粮食仓库！郭镇在历史上就没有过粮食仓库，今天有了，以后还会修建更多更大的粮仓！”
    我们一面听着，一面悠然神往。这天正是秦岭山区少有的好天气。抬头一望，我们又看见了高山上的雄鹰飞翔着。那么矫健，那么勇敢，千万重山都不在眼下。秦岭的雄鹰啊！高高地飞吧！我们祖国的天空任凭你自由奔放地飞翔！（附图片）
