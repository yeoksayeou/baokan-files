A Letter
Worker of Xining Coal Machinery Plant, Xi Huiting

"Zhuma has written!" My friend Zhaba ran excitedly towards me. Zhuma's letter was so long, but I couldn't put it down even after reading it several times. To be honest, her passionate and interesting words made me so excited.

Zhaba handed me the letter, which read:

I am so reluctant to leave you all! However, the glorious task and desire to build my hometown and support agriculture inspires me to want to sprout wings and fly back to the lovely Qinghai Lake.

The first day I returned to my hometown was an afternoon. The commune's Party committee held a welcome meeting for us in the newly built "Commune Members' Home" hall. In the evening, when the moon rose, according to our hometown's customs, a Hua'er folk song gathering was held. The Party Secretary, oh, right, Uncle Yangjin, started by singing: "Sunflowers always face the sun, our hearts always face the Communist Party. The People's Commune builds a golden bridge, stepping on the golden bridge to go to paradise." Zhaba, you know, by this time, my throat was itching unbearably, so I continued to sing: "The Party's kindness is like parents, sending me to study and nurture me. Now returning home to engage in agriculture, for the sake of reaching paradise early." As soon as I finished singing, everyone kept asking me to sing more. Just then, Uncle Yangjin pulled me to sit on the slightly yellowed grassland. He said with great interest: "It's great that you've returned home this time to participate in agricultural production." He also said, "This year's highland barley is a rare bumper harvest in a century. What's even more gratifying is that factories and reservoirs will be built on our grassland. We must completely change the face of the grassland..." I was so happy I almost jumped up. At this time, Uncle Yangjin said again: "If your father and mother were still alive, how happy they would be to see such a scene!" It's true, it would be so great if my father and mother were here! I couldn't help but recall that on the day my mother gave birth to me, the hateful chieftain said that I had brought misfortune to his family and tied my mother to a horse's tail, dragging her to death. After my mother died, my father went crazy with anger and later fell ill in his tent and died with injustice! Uncle Yangjin was my father's best partner, and he adopted me. After liberation, he sent me to school, and this time, I was one of the first group of people sent out by the commune to study.

I asked Uncle Yangjin to give us tasks quickly; I really couldn't wait. But he said, "No, you should rest for a few days first. We are currently studying the issue of winter irrigation, striving for an even greater harvest next year!"

Without saying a word, I ran off to find our partners and told them the news. When I explained that the commune Party committee was preparing for winter irrigation and wanted to install the ten water pumps we brought as a gift, everyone unanimously agreed: Let's do it right away! So, several of us started working. The wind was cold on our bodies, but everyone's heart was like a burning butter lamp, warm and comfortable.

"Good! You are truly newborn calves, fearing nothing." I looked back and saw, ah, it was Uncle Yangjin. By the moonlight, I found his expression was quite strange, as if he was about to get angry, and as if he was smiling. Later, he lovingly scolded us for not listening to him. Just as I was about to answer, ah, the commune members all came, carrying large pots of steaming hot milk tea. After drinking a bowl of milk tea, my whole body felt warm and full of energy.

The "rapid installation method" you taught us turned out to be so smooth. When we finished installing all ten water pumps, Uncle Yangjin happily asked: "Is it done?" "All done, just waiting for your command." "Wait!" He turned to the commune members and said: "The worker comrades have come to support us, installing water pumps for us, it's like sending charcoal in the snow! It's wonderful!"

Uncle Yangjin pushed the power switch, and instantly, ten water pumps spewed out ten large columns of water. At this moment, people cheered, lifting us up one by one, throwing us up and catching us again, and then throwing us up again. I was especially happy that day and didn't feel tired at all.

Zhaba, now, the Party committee has arranged a small factory for us, and I have also taken on apprentices. Of course, there are many difficulties. However, when I think of the commune's villagers and the land waiting for us, and when I recall the Party's囑託 (zhǔtuō - exhortation) to us when we parted, it gives me infinite strength.

Uncle Yangjin saw the farewell photo of the two of us. He asked me who this young man was? I said he was my teacher. He asked me what this young man was like, and I said he was very good, a Party member, named Zhaba. But he laughed for a long time and said, "How can the teacher and apprentice just happen to be the two of you! I understand everything. When a lone goose leaves the flock, it always has a companion to rely on and follow. It's really fate that our commune is linked to your factory. Okay, I'll ask your factory's Party committee for this young man, Zhuma, are you willing! You write to tell Zhaba! Just say that I know him and tell him that our commune's livestock has increased tenfold since he left. Doesn't he love to ride horses? Good, we have the best breeding horses. Tell him not to mistake the sheep for white clouds when he comes back! Don't mistake the pears on our fruit trees for pumpkins!" Zhaba, listen, how interesting! Really, people say that you used to be the best rider in the village, and when you come back, we will definitely hold a horse race to welcome you!

Zhaba, seeing that I had finished reading the letter, said excitedly: "I have read this letter for the fifth time, but it seems that there is a kind of charm attracting me, and I always can't put it down." He smiled honestly and said: "I seem to see people using their own hands to change the original face of a vast grassland, that's right, friend! It is this new position that is attracting me, the glorious position of building a new grassland and a new countryside in the socialist motherland that is attracting me!"

    一封信
    西宁煤机厂工人　郗辉庭
    “珠玛来信了！”我的朋友扎巴，兴冲冲地向我跑来。珠玛的信虽然写了那么长，可我读了几遍还是不肯放下。说实话，她那热情、有趣的话真使我太激动了。
    扎巴把手里的信递给我，上面这样写道：
    我多么舍不得离开你们啊！可是，建设家乡，支援农业的光荣任务和渴望，又激发着我恨不得插上翅膀，一下飞回那可爱的青海湖畔。
    我回到家乡的第一天，是个下午。公社党委在新盖起的“社员之家”的大厅里，召开了欢迎我们的大会。晚上，月亮升起来的时候，按着咱们家乡的风俗，举办了花儿会，党委书记，哎，对了，就是央金叔叔。他首先唱道：“葵花总是向着太阳，我们的心总是向着共产党。人民公社架金桥，踏着金桥上天堂。”扎巴，你知道，到这个时候，我的嗓子已发痒的不行，也就接着唱道：“党的恩情似爹娘，送我学习好培养。如今回乡搞农业，为的早日上天堂。”我刚唱完，大家还叫我唱。正巧，央金叔叔拉我坐在有些发黄的草地上。他兴致勃勃地说：“你们这次回乡参加农业生产太好了。”他还说：“今年的青稞是百年少有的丰收。更让人高兴的是，在咱这块草原上，还要建立工厂、水库。要彻底改变草原的面貌。……”我听了简直乐得要跳起来。这时，央金叔叔又说：“要是你阿爸阿妈还活着，见到如今这般光景多高兴啊！”真的，阿爸阿妈要在该多好啊！使我不由得想起，阿妈生下我的那天，可恨的千户说我冲了他家的福，把阿妈拴在马尾上活活拖死了。阿妈死后，阿爸气疯了，后来一病倒在帐篷里含屈死去了！央金叔叔是阿爸最好的伙伴，他收养了我。解放后，他送我上学，这次，我又是公社派出去学习的第一批人中的一个。
    我向央金叔叔要求快给我们任务，实在等不住了。可是他却说：“不行。你们先休息几天再说。现在正在研究冬灌问题，争取明年更大的丰收！”
    我二话没说，撒腿就跑，找到我们的伙伴，告诉他们这个消息。当我说明公社党委正准备冬灌，要把带来的十部抽水机马上安装好，做为我们的献礼意见后，大家一致同意地说：马上干！这样，我们几个人就干开了。风吹在身上很冷，但是，我们每个人的心里就像烧起了酥油火把，热呼呼的那么舒服。
    “好哇！你们真是刚出生的牛犊，天不怕地不怕。”我回头一看，啊，是央金叔叔。借着月光，我发现他的表情挺古怪，好像是要生气，又好像是在笑。后来他疼爱地骂我们不听话，我刚想答话，啊，社员们都来了，他们抬来大壶大壶滚热的奶茶。一碗奶茶下肚，浑身发热，浑身是劲儿。
    你教给我们的“快速安装法”，没想到竟这么顺利。当我们把十部抽水机全部安装完的时候，央金叔叔高兴地问道：“好了吗？”“都好了，就等你的命令了。”“慢着！”他转向社员们说：“工人老大哥来支援我们了，给我们安装上抽水机，真是雪中送炭！太好了！”
    央金叔叔用手一推电闸，刹时，十台抽水机喷出十根大水柱。这下，人们一下欢腾起来了，把我们一个个抬起来，扔起来接住，再扔起来。这天，我特别高兴，一点也不觉得疲乏。
    扎巴，现在，党委给我们安排了一个小工厂，我也带上徒弟了。当然，困难很多。可是，我一想起公社的乡亲和土地正等着我们，想起临别时党对我们的嘱托，就使我增添了无限的力量。
    咱俩的临别合影叫央金叔叔看到了。他问我这个小伙子是谁？我说是我师傅。他问我这小伙子怎么样，我说挺好，是党员，叫扎巴。可是他哈哈地笑了半天，他说：“哪有师徒正好是你们两个人！我全明白了，孤雁离群的时候，总有它的伴侣相依跟随。咱们公社跟你们厂挂钩真有缘份。好吧，我跟你们厂党委要这个小伙子，珠玛，愿意吧！你写信告诉扎巴！就说我认识他，并且告诉他咱公社的畜群比他走时提高了十倍，他不是爱骑马吗？好，咱们有顶好顶好的良种马，他回来时千万可别把羊群当成白云啊！别把咱们果树上的鸭梨当成南瓜啊！”扎巴，你听，多有意思啊！说真的，人们都说你从前是村里最好的骑手，等你回来还一定要举行赛马会迎接你呢！
    扎巴见我看完了信，激动地说：“我已经第五次读这封信了，不过好像有一种魅力在吸引着我，总是不肯放下。”他憨厚地微微一笑，说：“我好像看到了在一片广阔的草原上，人们用自己的双手在改变着它原来的面貌，对了，朋友！是这个新的岗位在吸引着我，建设社会主义祖国的新草原、新农村的光荣岗位在吸引着我啊！”
