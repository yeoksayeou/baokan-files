    A Good Housekeeper for the Bachelor Dormitory
    The northern bachelor dormitory of the Fuxin Haizhou Coal Mine houses over 1,500 employees. Guo Zhanzhi is the only person managing this large dormitory. He is not only the administrator, statistician, accountant, and custodian here, but also manages all kinds of household affairs for the employees, such as remitting money, sending parcels, receiving family members, running errands, and delivering letters, truly becoming a good housekeeper for the single employees.
    Guo Zhanzhi started as the bachelor dormitory administrator in 1958. He enthusiastically handles all kinds of daily “trivial matters” for the employees. He cleans the dormitory with the service staff every day and provides workers with water for washing and laundry after they get off work. Once, when the service staff in the sixth room was sick, Guo Zhanzhi took over her work, busy from morning to night.
    In the past, elderly workers and young workers in this dormitory lived together. When the young people returned to the dormitory after work, they chatted and laughed, playing musical instruments, making the entire room lively; however, the older workers preferred to rest quietly after work, which caused conflicts. After learning about this situation, Guo Zhanzhi, based on everyone's opinions, concentrated the older workers over the age of fifty in one room. In addition, he used old construction materials to build a recreation room, providing everyone with a place for entertainment while maintaining the quietness of the rooms. The workers were very satisfied. (Attached picture)

    独身宿舍的好管家
    阜新海州煤矿北部独身宿舍，住着一千五百多名职工。这样大的宿舍只有郭占智一个人作管理工作。他不但是这里的管理员、统计员、会计员、保管员，还管理着职工的各种各样家务事，替他们汇钱、寄邮包、接待家属、跑腿捎信等等，真正成为独身职工的好管家。
    郭占智是从1958年开始当这个独身宿舍管理员的。他十分热心地为职工们办理各种生活“琐事”。每天跟服务员一起清扫宿舍，工人下班回来后，给工人打洗脸水、洗衣服。有一次，第六寝室的服务员病了，郭占智就代替她的工作，从早忙到晚。
    过去，这个宿舍里的老年工人和青年工人是混住在一起的。青年人下班回到宿舍，有说有笑、吹拉弹唱，把整个寝室弄得热气腾腾；老工人下班后却喜欢安静休息，这就发生了矛盾。郭占智了解到这个情况后，根据大家的意见，把五十岁以上的老工人集中在一个寝室里住，另外又利用废旧建筑材料修起一座游艺室，使大家有了娱乐场所，又保持了寝室的安静，工人们都很满意。（附图片）
