　　On the Road to Laborization
　　——A Record of Cadres Sent Down from the Chinese Academy of Sciences for Labor Training
　　By our reporters Li Langui and Ren Zhenhua
　　In Shatou Commune, Yiyang County, Hunan Province, we visited a group of young scientific researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences who had been sent down for labor training. Although they had only been sent down for ten months, they had received widespread praise from the commune members, and everyone was spreading the model deeds of the cadres after work. And each of these more than 120 cadres sent down had varying degrees of gains and experiences.
　　Passed the Test
　　Over the past ten months, the cadres sent down from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have gained a profound understanding of the Party's policy of "intellectualizing workers and peasants and laborizing intellectuals." In February of this year, continuous cold waves attacked the rice seedlings, and the seedlings were in danger of rotting. At this time, they worked with the commune members day and night in the fields to protect the seedlings, sometimes soaking their whole bodies and freezing their feet red when going into the water. When the rice fields lacked windbreaks, they did not hesitate to take out their own bedding and tents to use as windbreaks. Their actions deeply moved the masses. The leader of the fifth work group of Shatou Production Team told us that the cadres from Beijing endured hardship and were hardworking, setting an example for the masses. Pointing to a patch of emerald green radish greens by the embankment, he said: Look, those vegetable plots were reclaimed by the cadres sent down.
　　Their achievements in labor training today did not come easily. Cadre He Kuanxiang grew up in Beijing and rarely participated in physical labor in the past, knowing nothing about agricultural production. After being sent down to Yiyang County at the beginning of the year, he encountered a series of difficulties in his work. Could he persevere in the long run? He once had feelings of fear and difficulty. With the help of the team leaders, when he worked with the commune members, they kindly told him how to operate, and when they saw that he was tired, they considerately advised him to rest more. These things moved him very much. "We must persevere!" he was determined. From then on, he realized that farm work was also not a simple job, and that it could not be learned without hard work. After a period of labor, he gradually learned some farm work, his body became stronger than before, and his will became stronger. During the drought, he persisted in treading water for fourteen consecutive days. During the early rice harvest, he and three other cadres formed a threshing group, and their work efficiency reached the standard of a strong laborer. He was repeatedly rated as a model and pace-setter by the commune members.
　　Dedicate Knowledge to the Countryside
　　Some technical cadres who used to sit in the research room all day and never asked about production labor, after going to the countryside to work, supplemented their knowledge of production with the help of the commune members. In June of this year, some rice fields in Shatou Commune were infested with rice stem borers. The headquarters of the cadres sent down designated Comrade Yang Jianmei, who had been a postgraduate student in entomology for four years, to conduct investigations and assist in prevention and control. Comrade Yang Jianmei had read many books about rice stem borers in the past. In the research room, she had repeatedly studied and observed the habits of rice stem borers, the shape of the head, chest, tail, and even the wing veins. But this time, when she went to the field, she could not distinguish between the first and second generations of rice stem borers, but a common peasant technician quickly identified them. This incident shocked Comrade Yang Jianmei. She said excitedly: "I am too empty, and theory that is divorced from production reality is useless no matter how much there is!" She said that she would definitely come to production practice to fill this gap and contribute real knowledge to the working people and agricultural production.
　　Before being sent down, a few technical cadres believed that "doing scientific research is just about doing something profound." When formulating scientific research projects, some people were unwilling to engage in research on projects such as "wind-powered waterwheels" and "low-head hydropower generation," looking down on these rustic things. Now that these comrades have come to the countryside, they have seen with their own eyes the great role these native machines play in the countryside, especially when they personally bent down and planted rice seedlings, when they stepped on the treadles of waterwheels to draw water on hot days, and when they studied around a dim kerosene lamp the size of a bean at night. They sincerely said: "Rice transplanters, wind-powered waterwheels, and low-head hydropower generation are very important. How much the countryside needs these things!"
　　Having received a vivid education in labor production activities, the cadres actively used their existing book knowledge to help the commune carry out technical innovations.
　　In the past, the chemical fertilizers and pesticides manufactured in Yiyang County had to be sent to Changsha City, 260 miles away, for testing. Now, with the help of Comrade Cheng Zuliang and other cadres sent down from the Academy of Sciences, they have established their own laboratory. In this laboratory, a tinplate sandbox by the wall is their "heater," and a pot steamer is their "distiller." When they test bacterial fertilizers, they do not use white sugar as an ingredient, but rice soup.... But with these things, they have been able to test for 27 elements. Liu Hehua, a testing technician, was a middle school student who was recently transferred from the commune. She lacked basic knowledge of testing and did not know how to perform technical operations. Comrade Cheng Zuliang lectured her, teaching her knowledge while testing. After more than a month of training and practice, Liu Hehua can now test for more than ten elements on her own. Comrade Cheng Zuliang also considered the technicians in the laboratory and compiled the testing methods for each element into technical data for future reference. Once, the small hydroelectric power station in Henglongqiao Commune suddenly malfunctioned. The light bulb only showed a thin red filament and did not light up. The comrades at the power station could not find the reason for a long time. Comrade Gu Guobiao, who was sent down to the commune and originally worked in motor manufacturing, immediately ran to the power station, helped find the cause, modified the generator drive belt, and increased the motor speed. Soon the light bulb lit up again. There are many such things. Some people installed native lathes for commune-run factories, and some propagated Chlorella for the commune....
　　The Affection of Flesh and Blood
　　In labor training, because the cadres sent down were sincere, honest, and conscientious in their work, and humbly learned from the peasants, they established a deep, flesh-and-blood relationship with the commune members. Wherever they have worked, there are moving stories to be heard. Ran Yiqun, a research intern in operations research at the Institute of Mechanics, has been living in the home of poor peasant commune member Zhang Yuxiu since the day she arrived in Shatou Commune. She treats this place as her own home.
　　In labor production and life, cadres and commune members can help each other overcome difficulties and care for each other like a family. Sanliqiao Production Team of Henglongqiao Commune had a batch of lime to be transported back, and the journey was relatively long. The commune members were afraid that the cadres sent down would not be able to handle the burden and did not want them to go, but the cadres sent down insisted on going. Unable to reach an agreement, everyone went and quickly transported all the lime back. There was an old woman in this production team who was over eighty years old. When she saw that the clothes of the cadres sent down were worn out, she took the initiative to mend them one by one. Usually, the clothes that the cadres changed out of were unknowingly taken by the commune members to be washed, and when they returned home in the evening, the clothes were often folded neatly and placed on the bed. In the short period of more than ten months, the thoughts and feelings of the cadres sent down have undergone tremendous changes, and their feelings for the workers and peasants have increased. The noble qualities of the working people, such as diligence, sincerity, and infinite loyalty to the Party, have deeply infected the cadres. The airs of those intellectuals were unconsciously put down, and they became more respectful and loving of the working people.

    在劳动化的道路上
    ——中国科学院下放干部劳动锻炼纪实
    本报记者　李兰桂  任振华
    在湖南省益阳县沙头公社，我们访问了中国科学院下放劳动锻炼的一群青年科学研究人员。他们下放虽然只有十个月，但是却得到了社员群众的普遍赞扬，劳动之余，大家都在传扬下放干部的模范事迹。而这一百二十多位下放干部，每个人也都有程度不同的收获和体会。
      受住了考验
    十个月来，中国科学院下放干部们，对党提出的“工农群众知识化、知识分子劳动化”的方针有了深刻的体会。今年2月间，持续性的寒流袭击着秧苗，眼看秧苗有烂掉的危险，这时，他们日日夜夜与社员一起在田里护秧，有时全身被淋得透湿，下水时双脚冻得通红。当秧田边缺少挡风设备时，他们毫不犹豫地拿出了自己的被单、帐子去作挡风设备。他们的这种行动，深深地感动了群众。沙头生产队第五作业组组长告诉我们，北京来的这些干部吃得苦，耐得劳，给群众树立了榜样。他指着堤边一片长得翡青的萝卜菜地说：你看，那些菜地都是下放干部开垦出来的。
    他们今天劳动锻炼的成就，也不是轻易得来的。干部何宽祥是在北京城里长大的，过去很少参加体力劳动，农业生产知识一无所知。年初，下放到益阳县以后，在劳动中碰到了一连串的困难。是不是能长期坚持下去呢？他曾产生过畏难情绪，经过队领导的帮助，他与社员一起劳动时，社员也亲切地告诉他如何操作，看他干累了，就十分体贴地劝他多休息一下。这些使他很感动。“必须坚持下去！”他下定了决心。从这以后，他认识到农活同样是不简单的工作，不付出艰辛的劳动是学不会的。通过一段劳动时间以后，有些农活逐步学会了，身体也比以前扎实多了，意志更加坚强，抗旱的时候，他连续坚持车水十四天。收早稻时，他和另外三个干部组成一个扮谷小组，工效曾达到强劳动力的标准，他几次被社员们评为模范和标兵。
    把知识献给农村
    有一些过去整天坐在研究室、从不过问生产劳动的技术干部，到了农村中劳动以后，在社员们的帮助下，补上了生动的生产知识课。今年6月，沙头公社有的稻田里发生二化螟虫害，下放干部大队部指定曾经作过四年昆虫研究生的杨俭美同志进行调查、协助防治。杨俭美同志过去阅读过很多有关螟虫的书本，在研究室对于螟虫的习性，螟虫的头部、胸部、尾巴以至翅脉的形状都反复研究、观察过，可是这次一到田间，她却分不清一化螟与二化螟的区别，而被一个普通的农民技术员很快识别出来了。这件事使杨俭美同志大吃一惊，她激动地说：“自己太空虚了，脱离了生产实际的理论，再多也没有用处！”她表示今后一定到生产实际中来填补这个空白，将真正的知识贡献给劳动人民和农业生产。
    下放以前有少数技术干部认为：“搞科学研究嘛，就是闹点深奥的东西”。在制订科学研究项目时，有的人就不愿意从事“风力水车”、“低水头发电”等项目的研究，看不起这些土里土气的东西。现在这些同志来到了农村，他们亲眼看到这些土机械在农村中发挥的巨大作用，特别是当他们亲自弯腰低头插秧的时候，在酷暑天一脚一脚踏着水车蹬子车水的时候，在黑夜四五个人围着一盏豆大的煤油灯学习的时候，他们才心悦诚服地说：“插秧机、风力水车、低水头发电很重要，农村是多么需要这些东西啊！”
    在劳动生产活动中受到了生动教育，干部们就积极运用他们已有的书本知识帮助公社进行技术革新。
    益阳县过去制造的化肥、农药，总是要到二百六十里以外的长沙市去化验，现在在科学院下放干部程祖良等同志的帮助下，建立了自己的化验室。在这个化验室里，靠墙边的一个洋铁皮沙盘，就是他们用的“加热器”，锅甑就是他们用的“蒸馏器”，他们化验细菌肥料时，不是用白糖作配料，而是用米汤……。可是，他们就凭借这些东西，已经能化验二十七种元素了。化验员刘荷花是不久前从公社调来的一个中学生，化验基础知识缺乏，不知如何进行技术操作。程祖良同志就给她讲课，边化验，边传授知识，经过一个多月的培养和练习，刘荷花现在已能单独化验十多种元素了。程祖良同志又为化验室同志着想，将每个元素的化验方法编成技术资料，供以后进行化验时参考。一次，衡龙桥公社小型水力发电站忽然发生了故障，电灯只一线红丝，不发亮，发电站的同志很久未找出缘故。下放在该社的顾国彪同志，他原是做电机制造工作的，立即跑到发电站，帮助找出了原因，改装了发电机传动皮带，加快了电机转速，不久电灯又亮起来了。像这样的事情是很多的，有的人为社办工厂安装土车床，有的为公社繁殖小球藻……。
      骨肉的情谊
    在劳动锻炼中，由于下放干部诚诚恳恳、老老实实，认真劳动，虚心向农民学习，和社员群众建立了骨肉般的深厚感情。凡是他们劳动过的地方，都能听到一些动人的故事。力学所运筹学研究实习员冉毅群，从到沙头公社那天起就在贫农社员张玉秀家里落了户。她把这里当成了自己的家。
    在劳动生产和生活中，干部们与社员群众都能互相帮助克服困难和互相关心，亲如一家人。衡龙桥公社三里桥生产队有一批石灰要运回来，路程比较远。社员群众怕下放干部挑担吃不消，不要他们去；可是下放干部却争着要去。相持不下，大家都去了，很快就把石灰全部运了回来。这个生产队有个老婆婆，已经八十多岁了，她看到下放干部的衣服磨破了，就主动地给他们一件件都缝补得好好的。平时干部们换下的衣服不知不觉地被社员拿去洗好了，晚上回家时，衣服往往折叠得整整齐齐地放在床上。在短短的十个多月中，下放干部的思想感情起了巨大的变化，和工农群众的感情增加了。劳动人民那种勤劳、诚恳、对党无限忠诚的高贵品质，深深地感染了干部们。他们那些知识分子的架子不知不觉地放下了，他们更加尊敬和热爱劳动人民了。
