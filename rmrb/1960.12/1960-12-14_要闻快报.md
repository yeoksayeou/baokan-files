　　Inner Mongolia Grasslands Enter Busy Lambing Season

　　The vast grasslands of Inner Mongolia have entered a busy lambing season. In the past month or so, more than 180,000 lambs have been delivered in the region, with a survival rate of 95.7 percent. Currently, from the Hulunbuir grasslands to the winter pastures of the Ordos region, herdsmen of all ethnic groups are braving the cold wind and snow, delivering young livestock day and night.

　　Pastoral areas in the major grasslands of Yikezhao, Bayannur, Xilin Gol, and Hulunbuir have generally established specialized lambing and rearing organizations, trained lambing and rearing personnel, and implemented management systems such as livestock grouping, assigned personnel to specific groups, contracted production and survival rates, and bonus rewards for exceeding targets.

　　Xinjiang's Yutian People Reclaim Land from the Desert to Grow Grain

　　The Uyghur people of Yutian County, Xinjiang, who live along the southern edge of the famous Taklamakan Desert, are holding high the red flag of the people's commune and have begun to change the past situation of desert encroachment on farmland, launching a struggle to reclaim land from the desert to grow grain. This year, the people of the county have already diverted water to create more than 100,000 mu of farmland in the sandy wilderness. The Ye'ying area, about 300 li from the ancient city of Yutian, has undergone tremendous changes. The newly opened fields on both banks of the Kriya River stretch into the interior of the large sand dunes, with tender green winter wheat seedlings and clear canal water forming a sharp contrast with the surrounding vast yellow sand. Newly planted poplar saplings stand where the new fields meet the sand dunes.
