    The US economic community has predicted that US industrial production will continue to decline next year.
    According to an Associated Press report on the 4th, the US Chamber of Commerce's recent Business Outlook Conference in Washington estimated that the US Gross National Product will decline by $5-10 billion next year. Chamber of Commerce Economic Research Bureau Director Schmidt said that the US "economists almost unanimously believe that the future outlook is declining." According to reports, "Other participants' reports on the prospects of their industries also supported Schmidt's predictions."
    The participants of this conference specifically mentioned the unfavorable prospects of the automobile, steel, and construction industries, which are the three pillars of the US economy. According to forecasts from relevant industrial sectors, the total sales of automobiles in the US next year will decrease by 200,000 units compared to 1960. National Automobile Dealers Association Research Department Director Herzog admitted that the "unprecedented problem" faced by the US automobile industry is "how to dispose of the new car inventory in dealers' stocks." These inventories currently total more than 970,000 vehicles, 200,000 more than the previous highest record. As for the steel industry, participants admitted that the operating rate in 1960 would only be equivalent to one-half or two-thirds of its production capacity. In the "long-term sluggish" construction industry, the Associated Press said that "the actual number of new buildings" can only "barely exceed 1960."
    At the same time, according to a United Press International report on the 1st, the number of unemployed people in the United States in mid-November had increased to 4.2 million, and the total number of unemployed people for the entire month reached 4.5 million. The report also said that in November, "sales in almost all industries declined." New orders fell by $1.1 billion from mid-October to mid-November. Among them, new orders in the steel industry, based on the orders received, only require a 45% operating rate in December. United Press International said, "This will make December the worst month of the year, and people have long hoped that December will rebound."
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, December 6th: A document released by the US Department of Labor today admitted that in November, 51 of the 150 major industrial centers in the United States had become severely depressed areas. This number has increased by nine compared to the past.
    The Department of Labor today listed nine industrial centers in Connecticut, California, Washington, Indiana, and Ohio as severely depressed areas. The Department of Labor said that the increase in unemployment in these areas is due to the reduction in workers required for steelmaking, aircraft, aluminum manufacturing, and other durable goods manufacturing.
    Last November, there were 32 severely depressed areas among the 150 major industrial centers.
    The Department of Labor admits that 6% of workers in the United States are currently unemployed, and the Department of Labor believes that the number of unemployed people will increase again in January next year.

    美国工业下降失业增加
    商业展望会议预测明年生产总值将下降50—100亿美元
    劳工部承认全国主要工业中心已有三分之一成为严重失业区
    本报讯　美国经济界的一些人士预测，美国工业生产在明年将要继续下降。
    据美联社4日报道，美国商会最近在华盛顿举行的商业展望会议估计，美国国民生产总值明年将下降五十到一百亿美元。商会经济研究局局长施密特说，美国的“经济学家们几乎一致认为，未来的前景是下降”。据报道，“其他与会者就本行业前景所作的报告也支持了施密特的预言。”
    这次会议的参加者特别提到了作为美国经济三大支柱的汽车、钢铁和建筑业的不妙的前景。根据有关工业部门人士的预测，美国明年的汽车销售总额将比1960年减少二十万辆。全国汽车经售商协会研究处处长赫措格承认，美国汽车工业面临的“一个空前未有的问题”，是“如何处理掉经售商库存中的新汽车存货”。这些存货目前已达九十七万多辆，比以往库存的最高纪录还多二十万辆。至于钢铁工业，与会者承认，1960年的开工率将只相当于它的生产能力的一半或三分之二。在“长期以来没有起色的”建筑业方面，美联社说，“新建筑的实际数”只能“勉强超过1960年”。
    与此同时，据合众国际社1日报道，美国11月份中旬的失业人数已增加到四百二十万人，全月失业总数达到四百五十万人。报道还说，在11月份内，“几乎所有行业的销售额都下降了”。新订货从10月中旬到11月中旬下降了十一亿美元。其中钢铁业的新订货按收到的订单情况计算，12月份只要开工45％就行了。合众国际社说，“这将使12月份成为今年最糟糕的月份，而人们长期以来希望12月份是会回升的”。
    新华社6日讯　华盛顿消息：美国劳工部今天发表的一份材料承认，在11月份，美国一百五十个主要工业中心中，已经有五十一个成为有严重失业的地区。这个数字比过去增长了九个。
    劳工部今天把康涅狄格、加里福尼亚、华盛顿、印第安纳和俄亥俄州的九个工业中心列为有严重失业的地区，劳工部说，这些地区失业增加是因为炼钢、飞机、制铝和其他耐用品制造业所需的工人减少。
    去年11月，在一百五十个主要工业中心中，有严重失业的地区是三十二个。
    劳工部承认，美国现在有6％的工人失业，劳工部认为，失业人数在明年1月还要增加。
