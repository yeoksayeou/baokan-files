    “Poor Mountainous Country” Takes on a New Look
    ——Agricultural Mechanization Movement Sweeps Cijiang Province's Mountainous Areas in North Korea

    Cijiang Province (equivalent to a province), a mountainous area in northern North Korea with relatively backward industry and agriculture in the past, is today vigorously launching a mass agricultural mechanization movement.

    Cijiang Province is located deep in the Jiangnan and Langlin mountain ranges, stretching for hundreds of miles. This is a mountainous area with thin soil, a small population, difficult transportation, and continuous rain in the summer; more than 60% of the cultivated land area belongs to pure shifting cultivation (i.e., wasteland in mountainous areas), and even the paddy fields are mixed with a lot of sand and gravel. In the past, people called this mountainous area the "poor mountainous country," and the province's grain relied on external support every year until after liberation. However, the farmers in the plateau mountainous area who have embarked on the Chollima, under the leadership of the Workers' Party, are changing the backwardness of the mountainous area at a speed of a thousand miles a day, just like other rich plain areas.

    In-depth investigation and research needed
    Developing various agricultural tools and transportation tools suitable for mountainous agriculture is the most important task facing the people in the mountainous areas. In order to completely change the poor and backward face of the mountainous area, the Party and People's Committee of Cijiang Province, on the one hand, widely publicized the necessity and superiority of rural mechanization to the peasant masses. At the same time, they also organized agricultural machinery investigation and research teams to go deep into the countryside to study a series of issues related to agricultural machinery needed in mountainous agriculture and their use methods. On the other hand, in order to repair agricultural tools, thirty-five factories and state-owned enterprises were linked with sixty-five agricultural production cooperatives to be responsible for repairing and helping to replenish parts or other urgently needed materials. The state also allocated fifteen machine tools, eighty-three electric motors and transformers, copper wire, water pumps, etc. for use by agricultural cooperatives.

    In order to effectively use electric motors and gas engines, with the Provincial Comprehensive Machinery Factory as the center, more than 180 engine operators were trained and sent to the countryside to support agriculture. At the same time, workers with higher technical levels often went deep into various agricultural cooperatives to help farmers repair agricultural machinery, further strengthening the extensive ties and unity between workers and peasants.

    Vigorously solve the power problem
    Solving the power problem is an important link for mountainous areas to move towards agricultural mechanization. In order to solve this problem, the Provincial People's Committee has built 178 power stations with a production capacity of 1,578 kilowatts in remote mountainous areas. Small and medium-sized hydropower stations have also been built in every "ri" (village).

    Due to the rapid development of power equipment, various agricultural cooperatives have been able to widely use various engines and water pumps, so that major departments such as threshing, rice milling, feed crushing, flour milling, and transportation have all achieved mechanization. 145 agricultural cooperatives in the province have added waterwheels, and 312 gas engines have also been added. The province's agricultural machinery factory has also begun to mass-produce small tractors and various trailers.

    Increased agricultural and sideline income
    The rapid increase in the degree of mechanization in mountainous areas has opened up broad avenues for the development of mountainous agriculture and sideline production. This year's cultivated land area has been expanded by more than 4,540 "tingbu" (one "tingbu" is about 15 mu) compared with last year, and the grain sown area has increased by 140.1% compared with last year. Therefore, this year's grain output has greatly increased compared with last year. Due to the improvement of mechanization level, rational organization and arrangement, and the use of labor, a large amount of agricultural labor has been saved. The surplus labor force, in addition to engaging in animal husbandry, also participates in various sideline productions. This year, the collection of wild fruits and other wild plants has increased by more than 1,100 tons compared with last year, which has greatly increased the cash income of farmers. It is estimated that this year's cash income per household will be 307 yuan (North Korean currency), and each household will be able to distribute 920 kilograms of grain. All farmers will reach the living standards of middle peasants or well-to-do middle peasants.

This small tractor has 5.5 horsepower and can cultivate one "tingbu" (about 15 mu) of land in one day. Its biggest feature is that it can be used on very small plots of land.

### “穷山之国”面貌一新——朝鲜慈江道山区掀起农业机械化运动

    “穷山之国”面貌一新
    ——朝鲜慈江道山区掀起农业机械化运动
    在过去工农业比较落后的朝鲜北部山区慈江道（相当于省），今天正在大力展开群众性农业机械化运动。
    慈江道位于绵延几百里的江南山脉和浪林山脉的深处。这里是土薄人少，交通困难，夏天又是阴雨连绵的万山之地；60％以上的耕地面积属于纯火田（即山区的生荒地），就是稻田也混杂着很多砂石。人们过去把这个山区叫做“穷山之国”，这个道的粮食直到解放后还是年年依靠外地支援。但是，跨上千里马的高原山区农民，在劳动党的领导下，同其他富饶的平原地带一样，正在以日行千里的速度，改变着山区的落后面貌。
    深入调查研究需要
    发展适应于山区农业的各种农具和运输工具，是摆在山区人民面前的头等重要任务。为了彻底改变山区贫穷落后的面貌，慈江道的党和人民委员会，一方面向农民群众广泛宣传农村机械化的必要性及其优越性，同时，还组织农业机械调查研究小组，深入到农村，研究有关山区农业所需要的农业机械及使用方法等一系列问题；另一方面，为了修缮农具，三十五个工厂和国营企业同六十五个农业生产合作社挂了钩，负责修理和帮助添补零件或其他急需材料。国家还拨出十五台机床、八十三台电动机和变压器、铜线、抽水机等供给农业社使用。
    为了有效地使用电动机和煤气发动机，以道综合机械工厂为中心，培养了一百八十多名发动机操纵手，分赴农村支援农业。同时，技术水平较高的工人也常常深入到各农业社，帮助农民修理农业机械，进一步加强了工农之间的广泛联系和团结。
    大力解决动力问题
    解决动力问题是山区走向农业机械化的一个重要环节。为了解决这一问题，道人民委员会在偏僻的山区建设了一百七十八所生产能力拥有一千五百七十八瓩的发电站。每一个里（村）还建设了中小型水力发电站。
    由于动力设备的迅速发展，各农业社能够广泛地使用各种发动机和抽水机等，使脱谷、精米、饲料粉粹、制粉以及运输等主要部门，都实现了机械化。全道内有一百四十五个农业社添设了水车，还增加了三百一十二台煤气发动机。道的农业机器厂也已开始大量生产小型拖拉机和各种挂车。
    农业副业收入增加
    山区机械化程度的迅速提高，为发展山区农业和副业生产开辟了广阔的道路。今年的耕地面积比去年扩大了四千五百四十余町步（一町步约合十五市亩），粮食播种面积比去年增加140.1％。因此，今年的粮食产量比去年大为增加。由于提高机械化水平、合理组织安排和使用劳动力，大量节约了农业劳动力。节余下来的劳动力，除了从事畜牧业外，还参加各种副业生产。今年采集的野果和其他各种野生植物就比去年增加一千一百多吨，这样就大大增加了农民的现金收入。预计今年每户现金收入为三百零七元（朝币），每户可分到粮食九百二十公斤。所有农户将达到中农或富裕中农的生活水平。
