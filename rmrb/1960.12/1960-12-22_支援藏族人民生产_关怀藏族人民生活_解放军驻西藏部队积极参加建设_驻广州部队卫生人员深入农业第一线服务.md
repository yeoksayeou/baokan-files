Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 21st – The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet are actively helping the Tibetan people develop production and improve their lives, contributing greatly to border construction.

The Tibet troops have always regarded participating in border construction and helping Tibetan compatriots develop production as a glorious task. While performing border defense duties and conducting training, they actively participated in border construction. Since the beginning of this year, various units have responded to the call of the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC and the Party Committee of the troops to carry out various activities to care for the lives of the Tibetan people and support their production. The troops stationed in the Ali area cultivated more than 20,000 "ke" of land for the local people this year, accumulating and transporting tens of millions of "jin" of fertilizer. A certain garrison unit allocated a large number of livestock to help Tibetan people reclaim wasteland, increasing the cultivated area there by more than 67,000 "ke" compared to last year. At the same time, the troops also actively organized the masses to fight against natural disasters. The garrison area of a certain regiment suffered a hailstorm in the summer, and many Qing稞 [barley] were knocked down by the hail. The troops immediately helped the masses to support the seedlings, prune the leaves, and cultivate the soil for topdressing. After several days of efforts by the army and the people, 95% of the crops were saved.

In order to develop Tibet's transportation, water conservancy, and electric power industries, this year, the troops in Tibet and the Tibetan people jointly built many simple roads and more than 74,000 meters of canals, as well as many small bridges and reservoirs. They also built a hydroelectric power station.

Helping Tibetan people manufacture, repair, and learn to use various new agricultural tools is an important aspect of the troops' support for the development of production for the Tibetan people. The troops' machinery manufacturing and repair units fully tapped their potential to provide technical support for local agricultural production. In addition to helping repair agricultural machinery at any time, an automobile repair factory of a certain unit manufactured more than 4,200 various types of agricultural tools and gave them to the Tibetan people. At the same time, they also trained new-style walking plow operators for the local people, as well as ironworkers, carpenters, and other technical workers who can handle general repair work.

The troops stationed in Tibet are also extremely concerned about the health care of the Tibetan people. This year, a hospital of a certain unit ran an eight-month primary medical personnel training class for the Shigatse and Gyantse areas, where more than 140 Tibetan youths learned relevant basic health knowledge and medical skills. The health department of a certain unit stationed in the pastoral area trained more than 120 veterinary personnel for the local people.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 20th – Medical teams composed of health agencies and hospitals of the PLA stationed in Guangzhou are actively serving agricultural production. They go deep into rural people's communes for mobile treatment. In the past month, they have treated diseases and conducted physical examinations for more than 2,000 commune members. Adhering to the principle of "simultaneous propaganda, simultaneous treatment, simultaneous training, and simultaneous construction," they also trained health personnel for the communes and improved the communes' sanitary conditions.

In early November, the Guangzhou garrison warmly responded to the Party's call for "vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain production." It transferred a group of military doctors, nurses, and some cadres to form a medical support team for agriculture, bringing medicines to serve the front line of agricultural production. They went deep into the Tangxia and Lile people's communes in Xinhui County and the Lintang people's commune in Gaoyao County in the Jiangmen area. They ate, lived, worked, and consulted with the commune members. Under the unified leadership of the local Party committees and health departments, they diagnosed and treated the commune members, conducted physical examinations, and carried out health propaganda activities, which were deeply welcomed by the commune members. The medical team working in the Chabu Production Brigade of the Lintang People's Commune in Gaoyao County often walked dozens of miles of mountain roads to provide medical services.

The medical team also helped five canteens and a kindergarten establish health systems and held health training classes for cooks and nursery staff. (Attached picture)

    新华社拉萨21日电　中国人民解放军驻西藏部队积极帮助藏族人民发展生产、改善生活，为边疆建设贡献了很大力量。
    西藏部队一直把参加边疆建设，帮助藏族同胞发展生产，作为一项光荣任务。他们在执行边防任务和进行训练的同时，积极参加了边疆建设。今年以来，各部队响应了中共西藏工委和部队党委的号召，开展了关怀藏族人民生活、支援藏族人民生产的各种活动。驻阿里地区的部队，今年为当地群众耕种了两万多克土地，积肥、运肥上千万斤。某地驻军抽出大批牲畜帮助藏民开荒，使那里的耕地面积比去年增加了六万七千多克。同时，部队还积极组织群众向自然灾害作斗争。某团驻地夏天遭受了雹灾，许多青稞被雹子打倒，部队立即帮助群众扶苗剪叶、培土追肥。军民经过几天的努力，救活了95％的庄稼。
    为发展西藏的交通、水利和电力等事业，今年西藏各部队和藏民一起修了许多简易公路和七万四千多米长的水渠，以及许多小型的桥梁、水库，还建立了一座水电站。
    帮助藏族人民制造、修理以及学习使用各种新式农具，是部队支援藏族人民发展生产的一个重要方面。部队的机械制造和修配单位，都充分挖掘潜力，从技术上支援当地的农业生产。某部队汽车修配厂，除随时帮助修理农业机具外，自己还制造了四千二百多件各种式样的农具送给了藏民。同时，他们还为驻地群众训练了新式步犁手，以及能担负一般修理活的铁工、木工等技术工人。
    驻西藏部队对藏族人民的卫生保健事业，也极为关怀。某部队医院，今年为日喀则和江孜地区开办了一个为期八个月的初级医务人员训练班，一百四十多名藏族青年在那里学会了有关的基本卫生知识和医疗技术。驻牧区的某部队卫生部门，为当地人民培养训练了一百二十多名兽医人员。
    新华社广州20日电　解放军驻广州部队卫生机关和医院组成的医疗队，积极为农业生产服务，深入农村人民公社，进行巡回治疗，一个月来，已为二千多名社员进行了疾病治疗和体格检查。他们本着“边宣传，边治疗，边培养，边建设”的原则，还为公社培养了卫生人员，改善了公社卫生条件。
    11月初旬，广州驻军热烈响应党的“大办农业、大办粮食”的号召，抽调了一批军医、护士和部分干部组成支援农业医疗队，携带药品，到农业生产第一线服务。他们在江门专区深入新会县棠下、礼乐和高要县莲塘人民公社，与社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，在当地党委和卫生主管部门统一领导下，为社员诊病、检查体格，并且开展卫生宣传活动，深受社员欢迎。在高要县莲塘人民公社察步生产大队工作的医疗小组，他们经常步行几十里山路出诊。
    医疗队还帮助五个食堂、一个幼儿园建立卫生制度，并举办了炊事员、保育员卫生训练班等。（附图片）
