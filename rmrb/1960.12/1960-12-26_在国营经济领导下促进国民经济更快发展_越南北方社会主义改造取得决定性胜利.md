Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, dispatch from our reporter: North Vietnam has achieved a decisive victory in its socialist transformation this year. More than 84% of farming households have joined agricultural cooperatives, 87% of handicraftsmen have been organized, and private enterprises have been transformed into joint state-private enterprises.

Since the beginning of this year, especially this autumn, North Vietnam's socialist transformation has been rapidly accelerating. Taking agricultural cooperativization as an example, at the end of 1959, there were over 1.23 million farming households in cooperatives, accounting for 45.4% of all farming households in the North. But by the beginning of June this year, the number of households participating in cooperatives had reached more than 1.54 million, accounting for 55% of all farming households; by the end of November, this had risen to more than 2.25 million, accounting for more than 84% of all farming households. Now, the number of households joining cooperatives has approximately doubled compared to the end of last year. While establishing new agricultural cooperatives, existing cooperatives in various regions have also expanded.

Driven by the Labor Party of Vietnam's socialist transformation policy and the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, the socialist transformation of handicrafts, small merchants, and private industrial and commercial enterprises has also progressed very rapidly. For example, from the end of last year to the present, the proportion of small merchants participating in various cooperative organizations or transferred to other production sectors has increased from 12.9% of the total number of households to 67%. According to Nguyen Van Tao, Deputy Minister of Light Industry of Vietnam, 3,884 capitalist and other private enterprises, at the request of capitalists and shop owners, have been transformed into joint state-private enterprises or other forms of socialist production units. Approximately 80% of fishermen and salt farmers in North Vietnam have also achieved cooperativization.

The accelerated progress of socialist transformation has further changed the face of agriculture, handicrafts, private industry and commerce, and other related industries in North Vietnam, and a thriving and vigorous new atmosphere has emerged in production and other work.

This year, the original and newly established agricultural cooperatives have demonstrated great superiority in developing production, resisting natural disasters, diversifying operations, rationally using human and material resources, and increasing the income of cooperatives and members. Following last year, North Vietnam suffered severe natural disasters such as drought and floods again this year. However, under the leadership of the Labor Party and the government, the peasants relied on the collective wisdom and strength to bravely fight drought and drain floods. As a result, the total output of early rice this year was still higher than the highest pre-war output in 1939. After the summer harvest, under the slogan of "using abundance to make up for deficiency," peasants in various regions launched a massive competition to seize a bumper harvest of late rice. They adopted measures such as multiple cropping, intercropping, mixed cropping, and reclaiming wasteland to expand the planting area, and strengthened field management, enabling many places to achieve a bumper harvest of early-maturing late rice. The early-maturing rice in Cao Bang province increased by about 10% compared to the bumper year of 1959. In terms of unit area yield of crops, agricultural cooperatives are generally higher than individual farmers. At the same time, agricultural cooperatives in various regions have also vigorously carried out basic farmland construction, built water conservancy projects, reclaimed wasteland, and vigorously engaged in fertilizer accumulation and afforestation. In the first ten months of this year, North Vietnam built more than 170 medium-sized water conservancy projects and tens of thousands of small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, excavating over 100.2 million cubic meters of earth, which is 21% more than the total amount of water conservancy earthwork completed in 1959. In addition, agricultural cooperatives in various regions have also widely developed diversified operations, developing pig breeding, fish farming, vegetable cultivation, brick burning, and various sideline productions. Cultural and health undertakings such as health stations, nurseries, cultural rooms, and cultural refresher courses in rural areas have also developed more than before.

The completion of the socialist transformation of handicraft production is of great significance to the economic development of North Vietnam. North Vietnam's handicraft production has always been very developed. Before the transformation, there were 17 departments and more than 150 industries. The output value of handicrafts was equal to more than 55% of the total output value of industry and handicrafts, and more than 300,000 people were engaged in handicraft labor. After these handicraftsmen were organized, they generally increased capital, added equipment, and expanded production. The types of products increased from more than 1,000 before the transformation to more than 6,000. The Hanoi Handicraft Cooperative, which has a large production scale, can smelt iron, cast iron, and manufacture simple machines and various new agricultural tools. The production of some cooperatives has been semi-mechanized and transformed into local state-owned factories. Handicraft cooperatives in Yen Bai province and other provinces have implemented the practice of joint operations between cooperatives or federations of cooperatives, so that machines and raw materials can be comprehensively utilized, and workers and technicians can cooperate in division of labor, giving full play to the superiority of collective production and overcoming the difficulties of lack of equipment, technology, and raw materials in the past, and producing many new products that one cooperative could not produce independently.

After being transformed into joint state-private, cooperative joint ventures, or state-owned enterprises, private industrial and commercial enterprises in North Vietnam have generally adjusted their organization, improved their management, and adjusted their relationship with state-owned enterprises, and new atmospheres have also appeared in production and other work. According to surveys and statistics, after the transformation of private industry, output generally increased by 30% to 50% compared with before the transformation, and costs decreased by 30%. After the transformation of the private transportation industry, the transportation volume per vehicle increased from 1,390 ton-kilometers per month before the transformation to 2,300 ton-kilometers, and the transportation volume per steamer increased from 7 million ton-kilometers per month to 10 million ton-kilometers.

At present, agricultural cooperatives, joint state-private enterprises, and various cooperative organizations in North Vietnam are vigorously consolidating and improving. They are improving business management, exploring potential, and striving to increase production and promote faster development of the entire national economy under the leadership of the state-owned economy. The initially consolidated primary agricultural cooperatives are now increasingly transitioning from primary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives, and from small cooperatives to large cooperatives.

    在国营经济领导下促进国民经济更快发展
    越南北方社会主义改造取得决定性胜利
    84％的农户加入合作社　87％的手工业者组织起来　私营企业转为公私合营
    据新华社河内电　本社记者报道：越南北方今年在社会主义改造事业方面取得了决定性的胜利。84％以上的农户已经加入了农业合作社，87％的手工业者参加了合作组织，三分之二以上的小商贩参加了各种合作组织或者被安排到一定的生产部门，对私营工商业的社会主义改造已经完成。
    自今年年初以来，特别是今年秋季以来，越南北方各方面的社会主义改造事业都快马加鞭，突飞猛进。拿农业合作化来说，在1959年底入社的农户一百二十三万多户，占全北方农户总数的45.4％。但到今年6月初，参加合作社的农户已经达到一百五十四万多户，占农户总数的55％；到11月底更上升到二百二十五万多户，占农户总数84％以上。现在，入社的农户已经比去年年底增加了约一倍。在建立新的农业合作社的同时，各地原有的合作社也扩大了。
    在越南劳动党的社会主义改造政策和农业合作化高潮的推动下，手工业、小商贩和私营工商业的社会主义改造的进展也非常迅速。例如，从去年年底到现在，参加各种合作组织和转入其他生产部门的小商贩，从占总户数的12.9％增加到67％。据越南轻工业部副部长阮文滔宣布，三千八百八十四个资本主义和其他的私营企业，在资本家和商店主的要求下，已经变成了公私合营企业或其他形式的社会主义的生产单位。越南北方的渔民和盐民也有80％左右实现了合作化。
    社会主义改造事业的加速进展使越南北方的农业、手工业、私营工商业及其他有关行业的面貌发生了进一步的变化，在生产和其他工作中出现了欣欣向荣、生气勃勃的新气象。
    今年，原有的和新建的农业合作社在发展生产、抵抗自然灾害、开展多种经营、合理使用人力物力，以及增加合作社和社员收入等方面，都显示出了巨大的优越性。越南北方在继去年之后，今年又遭到了严重的旱、涝等自然灾害。但是，农民们在劳动党和政府的领导下，依靠集体的智慧和力量，奋勇抗旱排涝。结果，今年早稻的总产量仍然高于战前产量最高的1939年。在夏收之后，各地农民在“以丰补歉”的口号下，展开了声势浩大的夺取晚稻丰收的竞赛运动。他们采取复种、间种、套种、混种和开垦荒地等措施扩大播种面积，并且加强田间管理，使许多地方的早熟晚稻获得了丰收。高平省的早熟稻比丰收的1959年还增产了10％左右。而在农作物的单位面积产量方面，农业社一般都高于单干农民。同时，各地农业社还大力进行农田基本建设，兴修水利，开垦荒地，大搞积肥和植树造林等。今年头十个月，越南北方共兴修一百七十多座中型水利工程和数以万计的小型农田水利工程，挖土一亿零二百多万公方，比1959年所完成的水利土方总和还多21％。此外，各地农业社还广泛开展多种经营，发展养猪、养鱼、种菜、烧砖以及各种副业生产。农村里的保健站、托儿所、文化室、文化进修班等文化卫生事业，也比以前有了更大的发展。
    完成手工业生产的社会主义改造，对越南北方的经济发展具有重大的意义。越南北方手工业生产向来就很发达，改造前共有十七个部门，一百五十多种行业，手工业产值等于工业和手工业总产值的55％以上，从事手工业劳动的有三十多万人。这些手工业者组织起来以后，普遍增加资金，增添设备和扩大生产。产品种类从改造前的一千多种增加到六千多种。生产规模较大的河内市手工业合作社，可以炼铁、铸铁、制造简单机器和各种新式农具。有些社的生产已经实现半机械化，转变为地方国营工厂。安沛省和其他省份的手工业合作社实行了社与社联营或联社的作法，使机器、原材料可以综合利用，工人、技术员可以分工协作，充分发挥了集体生产的优越性，克服了过去设备、技术和原材料缺乏的困难，生产出许多一个社无法单独生产的新产品。
    越南北方的私营工商业在改造成为公私合营、合作联营或国营以后，都普遍调整了组织，改进了管理，调整了同国营企业的关系，在生产和其他工作上也出现了新气象。据调查统计，私营工业经过改造后，产量一般比改造前增加了30％到50％，成本降低了30％。私营运输业在改造以后，每辆汽车的运输量由改造前的每月一千三百九十吨公里增加到两千三百吨公里，每艘汽船的运输量由每月七百万吨公里增加到一千万吨公里。
    目前，越南北方各地的农业社、公私合营企业和各种合作组织，正在大力进行巩固和提高。它们纷纷改善经营管理，发掘潜力，在国营经济的领导下为增加生产和促进整个国民经济的更快发展而努力。已经得到巩固的初级农业社，现在正愈来愈多地由初级社转为高级社，由小社并成大社。（附图片）
