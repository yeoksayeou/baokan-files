Xinhua News Agency, Simferopol, December 27th: The energy released by a "nova" recently discovered by Soviet scientists at the moment of its explosion is approximately equivalent to the energy released by the sun in 100,000 years.

    These are the observation results obtained by the Soviet Crimean Observatory at the end of the first phase of research on the "nova." The observatory has obtained approximately 120 spectral photographs of the "nova." It has been determined that the "nova's" surface layer, ejected during the explosion, is expanding outward at a speed of 1,800 kilometers per second. Its distance from us is 500 million times the distance between the sun and us, approximately 4,000 light-years.

    The Crimean Observatory is currently studying the temperature, mass, and characteristics of the newly discovered "nova's" outer shell based on the materials obtained. This will help obtain new information about the process leading to the "nova" explosion (possibly a thermonuclear process).

    苏联科学家观测结果
    “新星”爆发一刹那所释能量
    同太阳十万年间所释能量相当
    据新华社28日讯　据塔斯社森佛罗波尔27日讯：苏联科学家新近发现的“新星”在爆发时刻释出的能量约相当于太阳在十万年间释出的能量。
    这是苏联克里米亚天文台在结束对“新星”的第一阶段研究时得出的观测结果。这个天文台已经获得了约一百二十张这个“新星”的光谱照片。据确定，这个“新星”爆发时抛出的“新星”表层以每秒一千八百公里的速度向外扩展。它同我们的距离等于太阳同我们距离的五亿倍，即约为四千光年。
    克里米亚天文台目前正在根据所获得的材料研究新发现的“新星”外壳的温度、质量和它本身特性。这将有助于获得有关导致“新星”爆发过程（可能是热核过程）的某些新资料。
