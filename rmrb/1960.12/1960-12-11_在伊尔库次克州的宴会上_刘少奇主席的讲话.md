The Strong Unity of the Chinese and Soviet Parties and Countries is the Strong Desire of the Vast Majority of People in the World
Chairman Liu Shaoqi's Speech at the Banquet in Irkutsk Oblast

Xinhua News Agency News: Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, and Head of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation, spoke at a banquet held by the Irkutsk Oblast Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Irkutsk Oblast Soviet Executive Committee on December 9. The full text is as follows: Dear Comrade Brezhnev, Dear Comrade Sedinin, Dear Comrade Grishchenko, Dear Comrades:

　　I sincerely thank the people of Irkutsk and the leading comrades of the Party and government for their warm welcome and reception. Our Chinese Party and Government Delegation is very happy to visit your city after visiting Moscow, Leningrad, and Minsk.

　　Here, we visited your city and the Irkutsk Hydropower Station. Your people, with their creative and selfless labor, have built Irkutsk into a new major industrial city. Your city is undertaking major tasks and has achieved remarkable achievements in the cause of realizing the magnificent Seven-Year Plan and fully unfolding communist construction. All this has left a deep impression on us. We are heartily delighted by your achievements and wish you new and greater achievements in your future endeavors.

　　Your city is adjacent to our country and is a channel for brotherly and friendly exchanges between the people of our two countries. Every year, thousands of Chinese and Soviet people pass through here to various parts of China and the Soviet Union. Your city is very dear to the Chinese people.

　　Comrades, after visiting your country and contacting people from all walks of life, I have come to the conclusion that the Soviet people and the Chinese people have a strong desire to strengthen the unity of the people of the two countries. Whenever we talk about strengthening the unity between the two parties and two countries and the friendship between the people, people are very happy; conversely, any remarks and actions that are not conducive to the unity between our two parties and two countries, any remarks and actions that damage the foundation of this unity—the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism—cannot be accepted by the people of China, nor can they be accepted by the people of the Soviet Union. I also believe that this cannot be accepted by the people of all countries in the socialist camp, nor can it be accepted by more than 90% of the total population in the capitalist world. This is because the friendly feelings between the Chinese and Soviet people have a long-term and deeply rooted historical foundation; we still face powerful enemies—imperialism and reactionaries; our two countries and all socialist countries face serious common tasks of struggle and serious tasks of building socialism and communism; more than 90% of the total population in the capitalist world demand revolution, world peace, and the joint support of the socialist camp, especially the two major powers of China and the Soviet Union. Therefore, the people of all countries in the socialist camp and more than 90% of the total population in the capitalist world strongly demand the strong unity of the Chinese and Soviet parties and countries. History is created by the people. This strong desire of the vast majority of people in the world cannot and should not be violated. Our two parties—the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of China, and their central committees, our two governments—the Soviet government and the Chinese government—have reflected this strong desire of the people of our two countries and the vast majority of people in the world to demand unity, and have earnestly done everything necessary to strengthen the unity between our two parties and two countries. Therefore, I propose:

　　For the eternal and unbreakable friendship and unity between the Chinese and Soviet parties and countries and the people of the two countries,

　　For the brilliant achievements of the great Soviet people in developing communist construction,

　　For the health of the leading comrades of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government headed by Comrade Khrushchev,

　　I would also like to especially thank Comrade Brezhnev, because he accompanied us to visit all the places we wanted to visit, for the health of Comrade Brezhnev,

　　For the health of the Irkutsk Party and government leading comrades,

　　Cheers!

    中苏两党两国的坚强团结是世界绝大多数人民的强烈愿望
    在伊尔库次克州的宴会上
    刘少奇主席的讲话
    新华社讯　中国共产党中央委员会副主席、中华人民共和国主席、中国党政代表团团长刘少奇12月9日在苏联共产党伊尔库次克州委员会和伊尔库次克州苏维埃执行委员会举行的宴会上讲话，全文如下：亲爱的勃列日涅夫同志，亲爱的谢季宁同志，亲爱的格里琴科同志，亲爱的同志们：
    衷心地感谢伊尔库次克人民和党政领导同志对我们的热情的欢迎和接待。我们中国党政代表团在参观了莫斯科、列宁格勒和明斯克之后，现在又访问了你们的城市，感到十分高兴。
    在这里，我们参观了你们的城市和伊尔库次克水电站。你们人民以自己创造性的忘我劳动，把伊尔库次克建设成了一个新兴的大工业城市。你们的城市，在实现宏伟的七年计划和全面展开共产主义建设的事业中，担负着重大的任务，获得了卓越的成就。这一切都给我们留下了深刻的印象。我们为你们的成就衷心感到喜悦，并祝你们在今后的努力中取得新的更大的成就。
    你们的城市毗邻我国，是我们两国人民兄弟般的友好往来的孔道。每年都有上千上万的中国人和苏联人经过你们这里前往中国和苏联各地。你们的城市对于中国人民是十分亲切的。
    同志们：我们在你们的国家进行访问、同各界人民接触之后，使我获得这样一个结论：就是苏联人民和中国人民都有增强两国人民团结的强烈的愿望。当我们每次说到要增强两党两国之间团结和人民之间的友谊的时候，人们就十分高兴；相反，任何不利于我们两党两国之间的团结的言论和行动，任何损害这种团结的基础——马克思列宁主义的基本原理——的言论和行动，那在中国的人民中是通不过的，在苏联的人民中也是通不过的。我还相信，这在社会主义阵营所有国家的人民中也是通不过的，在资本主义世界总人口的90％以上的人民中也是通不过的。这是因为中苏两国人民之间的友好感情，具有长期的根深蒂固的历史基础；在我们的面前还站着强大的敌人——帝国主义和反动派；我们两国和所有社会主义国家都面临着严重的共同斗争的任务和严重的建设社会主义和共产主义的任务；资本主义世界总人口中90％以上的人民都要求革命，要求世界和平，都要求社会主义阵营、首先是中苏两大国的联合支援。因此，社会主义阵营所有国家的人民，和资本主义世界总人口中90％以上的人民，都强烈地要求中苏两党两国的坚强团结。历史是由人民创造的。全世界绝大多数人民的这种强烈愿望是不能违反，也不应该违反的。我们两党——苏联共产党和中国共产党和它们的中央委员会，我们两国政府——苏联政府和中国政府——都反映了我们两国人民和全世界绝大多数人民这种要求团结的强烈愿望，都认真地做了加强我们两党两国之间的团结所应该做的一切必要的事情。因此我提议：
    为中苏两党两国和两国人民之间的永恒的、牢不可破的友谊和团结，
    为伟大的苏联人民在开展共产主义建设中取得的光辉成就，
    为以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导同志们的健康，
    我还要特别感谢勃列日?夫同志，因为他陪同我们访问了我们所要访问的一切地方，为勃列日?夫同志的健康，
    为伊尔库次克党政领导同志们的健康，
    干杯！
