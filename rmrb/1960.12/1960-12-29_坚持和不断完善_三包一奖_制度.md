    Persisting in implementing the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system in rural people's communes is of great significance for improving the management level of the communes and mobilizing the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members. In summarizing the experience of running people's communes, sufficient attention should be paid to this issue.
    All our work, from revolution to construction, has been able to proceed smoothly and achieve one great victory after another because it relies on the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people, on the awareness of the broad masses of the people, and on the revolutionary initiative. The Party's ideological and political work, the Party's socialist and communist education of the people, is the most fundamental driving force for raising the people's awareness, mobilizing the people's enthusiasm, and promoting the people's revolutionary initiative. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly told all comrades in the Party to conduct propaganda work to the masses at all times and everywhere, and pointed out that in all work, "politics is the commander, politics is the soul." All comrades in the Party and all state personnel have conscientiously implemented Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, carried out extensive socialist and communist ideological education work among the broad masses of the people, greatly raised the awareness and enthusiasm of the people, and enabled our revolutionary cause and construction cause to achieve one great victory after another. Of course, our emphasis on putting politics in command and on ideological and political work does not mean that organizational work can be neglected. On the contrary, we have always advocated closely integrating ideological and political work with organizational work. Only in this way can the soaring revolutionary enthusiasm and initiative of the broad masses of the people be combined into a huge torrent, and the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people can be maintained for a long time and continuously increased. The "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system of contracting work, contracting output, contracting costs, and rewarding overproduction, which is widely implemented in people's communes, is a management system established on the basis of the continuous improvement of the ideological awareness of the broad masses of commune members. The implementation of this management system has in turn promoted the continuous improvement of the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members, thereby playing a very significant role in the consolidation of the people's communes and the development of agricultural production.
    The "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system is a basic and comprehensive responsibility system in socialist agricultural production under collective ownership in our country. In agricultural production, as in industrial production, there must be a sound responsibility system at all times; otherwise, it will be impossible to organize the enthusiasm of the masses, to establish normal order in production, to effectively carry out planned leadership and promote economic accounting, and therefore it will not be possible to achieve the goal of increasing production and reducing costs. The advantage of this responsibility system of "Three Guarantees and One Reward" lies in its ability to correctly adjust the relationship between the three-level management organizations of the commune, especially the relationship between the basic accounting unit (the contracting unit) and the grassroots production unit (the contracted unit), and to closely combine the interests of the small collective (production team) with the interests of the large collective (the basic accounting unit, the commune) and even the state, and to closely combine the personal interests of the commune members with the collective interests. Rules and regulations belong to the category of the superstructure and serve their own economic base. After the people's communes implemented the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system, the commune and the basic accounting unit could use this system to implement their production and financial plans to the grassroots production unit—the production team. The process of each production team actively implementing the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" contract is also the process of the broad masses of the people struggling to fully realize the overall plan; the better the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" contract is implemented, the more guaranteed the realization of the overall plan. After the implementation of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system, the people's communes and production teams can organize labor production competitions on the basis of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward." Overproduction and receiving rewards is the most glorious, the more overproduction, the more benefits the contracting unit gets, and the greater the contribution to the large collective and the state. This will inevitably encourage each contracting unit to supervise each other, evaluate and check each other, learn from each other's advanced experiences, help each other, and compete with each other in the process of implementing the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" tasks, and push production to a new upsurge. It is particularly important that after the implementation of this system, the rights and obligations between organizations at all levels are more clearly defined, the powers of cadres at all levels are more clearly distinguished, and the cadres of the production teams will be responsible, proactive, and specifically organize production under the unified leadership of the higher-level organizations. In this way, the leading cadres of the basic accounting unit and the commune can better go deep into the front line of production, go deep into the masses, understand the actual situation in a timely manner, concentrate their energy on studying policies, grasp policies, solve key problems in a timely manner, and better lead production and organize the lives of the masses. All of this combined will of course become a huge material force, powerfully promoting the faster development of the production cause of the people's communes and promoting the further consolidation of the people's communes.
    How should the people's communes improve the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" work and use this management system more effectively? Judging from the experience of the past two years, earnestly solving the following problems on the basis of continuously strengthening the Party's ideological and political work is of great significance for the correct implementation of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system.
    To implement the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system, it is first necessary to do a good job of the "Four Fixes" work of the production team, that is, the commune and the production team must guarantee to fix the cultivated land, labor force, draft animals, and farm tools to the production team for use. This "Four Fixes" is the basis for implementing the "Three Guarantees and One Reward." It is conceivable that if the commune and the basic accounting unit constantly mobilize and change the cultivated land, labor force, draft animals, and farm tools used by the production team, how can the production team's work plan be smoothly implemented? How can the enthusiasm and creativity of the team cadres and commune members be fully utilized? In order to enable the production team to do a good job in production under the unified leadership of the higher-level organization, smoothly complete the output contract task, and strive for overproduction, it must be given the right to fix and use a certain amount of cultivated land, labor force, draft animals, and farm tools. All production measures of the commune and the production team, such as organizing production and establishing large-scale high-yield fields, should be carried out with the production team as a unit, and the "Four Fixes" of the production team should not be disrupted; the organization of labor cooperation between teams or on a larger scale must also adhere to the principle of voluntary mutual benefit and equivalent exchange. The unit receiving cooperation exchanges labor for labor or evaluates work and records points, and pays according to work, and cannot mobilize the labor force and other means of production of the team without compensation. Among the "Four Fixes," the fixation of the labor force is particularly important. We should pay attention to regularly ensuring the quantity and quality of the labor force of the production team, so that the labor force of the team is adapted to the basic production tasks assigned to it. Temporary transfer of manpower and unplanned employment must be minimized as much as possible, so as not to disrupt the production order of the production team and weaken the strength of the first line of agricultural production. At the same time, it is also necessary to earnestly improve the leadership of agricultural production by the basic accounting unit, the commune, and other leading organs, and strive to avoid disrupting the team's work arrangements and hindering the rational use of the labor force due to improper command.
    Contracting output is the center of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward." To implement the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system, it is necessary to ensure that the output contract indicators are implemented. The so-called implementation has two meanings: one is that the indicators are set practically and appropriately; the other is that the output contract indicators must be truly and accurately implemented to the output contracting unit, accepted by the output contracting unit, and earnestly followed. These two layers are closely linked. If the output contract indicators are too low, they will not play a role in promoting production, and there is no point in talking about implementation; if the output contract indicators are too high, the output contracting unit will lose confidence in completing them and will not be willing to accept them, and of course there is no point in talking about implementation. The positive role of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system lies in encouraging the output contracting unit to increase production more, exceed the output contract indicators, and complete and overfulfill the production increase plan. Although there are provisions for rewarding overproduction and penalizing underproduction, the main purpose is to reward rather than punish. It is best if everyone overproduces and gets rewards, and does not underproduce and get punished, because more overproduction is of great benefit to the output contracting unit and the basic accounting unit, to the commune and the state. Therefore, the output contract indicators should be both active and leave room for maneuver, so that the output contracting unit has output to overproduce and rewards to obtain. The experience of implementing the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" for many years has proved that appropriate output contract indicators should be slightly higher than the actual output of the previous year under normal years, and slightly lower than the output that can be achieved in the current year. Such output contract indicators can be achieved and exceeded through the active efforts of the broad masses of commune members, thereby further stimulating the production enthusiasm of the commune members.
    To implement the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system, it must be serious and earnest, from beginning to end, to ensure that rewards and punishments are clear. As mentioned above, the output contract indicators must be practical and appropriate, and efforts should be made to achieve this when formulating the "Three Guarantees Plan." After the plan is finalized, it is best not to change it. It is of course very necessary to insist on implementing the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" plan under normal circumstances. Even when sudden abnormal situations occur, such as major natural disasters, we should still insist on handling affairs according to the plan after appropriately adjusting the "Three Guarantees" indicators. Agricultural production is greatly restricted by nature, and some major changes that occur in the production process, such as the attack of severe natural disasters, are often difficult to fully anticipate in advance. When it is found that the original indicators cannot be achieved in the process of implementing the "Three Guarantees and One Reward," we should not abandon the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system, but should promote democracy, fully consult with both the contracting and contracting parties, and adjust the "Three Guarantees" indicators seriously according to the actual situation, and continue to adhere to the implementation of the revised "Three Guarantees and One Reward" plan. We cannot abandon the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" halfway because the situation has changed. The "Three Guarantees and One Reward" is an important system that embodies the production policies of the Party and the state. The quality of its implementation is closely related to production, and we must treat this issue with a serious and earnest attitude.
    In the implementation of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward," Party committees at all levels should go deep into the masses, go deep into reality, closely integrate political work with economic work, closely integrate putting politics in command with material guarantees, correctly implement various relevant policies, greatly improve the sense of responsibility of cadres at all levels and the political awareness of the broad masses of commune members, and encourage everyone to strive to overfulfill the "Three Guarantees" indicators and the production increase and conservation plan. The "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system is based on the continuous improvement of the ideological awareness of the broad masses of commune members. The formulation, implementation, inspection of implementation, settlement and summary of implementation results of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" plan must be initiated by the masses, consulted with the masses, adopted the correct opinions of the masses, and continuously strengthened the Party's ideological and political work to improve the socialist and communist awareness of the masses; as long as we do these, we will be able to implement the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system and organize the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants into the production increase and conservation movement of vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain.

    坚持和不断完善“三包一奖”制度
    在农村人民公社中坚持实行“三包一奖”制度，对于提高公社经营管理水平、调动广大社员的生产积极性，具有重要意义。在总结人民公社办社经验当中，对于这个问题应当给予足够的重视。
    我们的一切工作，从革命到建设，所以能够顺利地进行和取得一个又一个伟大的胜利，都是依靠广大人民群众的积极性，依靠广大人民群众的觉悟和革命的主动精神。党的思想政治工作，党对人民群众的社会主义和共产主义教育，则是提高人民觉悟、调动人民积极性和发扬人民的革命主动精神的最根本的动力。所以，毛泽东同志反复地告诉全党同志，要随时随地向群众进行宣传工作，并且指出，在一切工作中“政治是统帅，政治是灵魂”。全党同志和全体国家工作人员，认真执行了毛泽东同志的这一指示，对广大人民群众进行了广泛的社会主义和共产主义思想教育工作，大大提高了人民群众的觉悟和积极性，使我们的革命事业和建设事业获得了一个又一个的巨大的胜利。当然，我们强调政治挂帅，强调思想政治工作，并不是说可以轻视组织工作。恰恰相反，我们从来就主张把思想政治工作和组织工作密切地结合起来的。只有这样才能把广大人民群众的高涨的革命热情和积极性汇合成巨大的洪流，使广大人民群众的积极性长期保持并不断高涨起来。人民公社广泛实行的包工、包产、包成本、超产奖励的“三包一奖”制度，就是在广大社员的思想觉悟不断提高的基础上建立起来的一种经营管理制度。这项管理制度的实施，又反转来促进了广大社员积极性的不断提高，从而对于人民公社的巩固、对于农业生产的发展起了十分巨大的作用。
    “三包一奖”制度是我国集体所有制的社会主义农业生产中的一项基本的、全面的责任制度。在农业生产中和在工业生产中一样，任何时候都必须有健全的责任制度；否则就不可能把群众的积极性组织起来，不能在生产中建立正常的秩序，不能有效地进行计划领导和推行经济核算，因而也就达不到增加生产、降低成本的目的。“三包一奖”这一责任制度的优点，在于它能够正确地调整公社的三级管理组织之间的关系，特别是基本核算单位（出包单位）和基层生产单位（承包单位）之间的关系，把小集体（生产小队）的利益和大集体（基本核算单位、公社）以至国家的利益密切结合起来，把社员个人利益和集体利益密切结合起来。规章制度属于上层建筑的范畴，是为自己的经济基础服务的。人民公社实行“三包一奖”制度后，公社和基本核算单位就可以通过这个制度，把自己的生产财务计划贯彻到基层生产单位——生产小队去。各个生产小队积极执行“三包一奖”合同的过程，也就是广大群众为完满地实现总的计划而斗争的过程；“三包一奖”合同执行得越好，总的计划的实现也就越有保证。实行“三包一奖”制度后，人民公社和生产队便可以在“三包一奖”的基础上组织劳动生产竞赛。超产受奖最光荣，超产得多，承包单位得到的好处也多，对大集体对国家的贡献也大。这就必然会激励各承包单位在执行“三包一奖”任务的过程中，互相督促，互相评比检查，互相学习先进经验，互相帮助，互相比赛，把生产推向新的高涨。特别重要的是，这个制度实行以后，使各级组织之间的权利义务更加明确，各级干部的职权更加分明，生产小队干部将在上级组织的统一领导之下，勇于负责地、积极主动地具体组织生产。这样一来，基本核算单位和公社的领导干部就可以更好地深入生产第一线，深入群众，及时了解实际情况，集中精力研究政策，掌握政策，及时解决关键问题，更好地领导生产和组织群众生活。这一切汇合到一起，当然会变成一股巨大的物质力量，强有力地推动着人民公社的生产事业更迅速地向前发展，推动着人民公社进一步巩固。
    人民公社应该怎样改进“三包一奖”工作，和更有成效地运用这项管理制度呢？从最近两年来的经验看，在不断加强党的思想政治工作的基础上，认真解决以下几个问题，对于“三包一奖”制度的正确贯彻，有着很重要的意义。
    实行“三包一奖”制度，首先要作好生产小队的“四固定”工作，就是公社、生产队必须保证把耕地、劳动力、耕畜和农具固定给生产小队使用。这种“四固定”是实行“三包一奖”的基础。可以设想，如果公社和基本核算单位不断地调动和变换生产小队所使用的耕地、劳动力、耕畜和农具，生产小队的作业计划怎么可能顺利地执行呢？小队干部和社员的积极性、创造性怎么可能充分地发挥呢？为了使生产小队能够在上级组织的统一领导下搞好生产，顺利完成包产任务而且力争超产，就必须赋予它固定使用一定数量的耕地、劳动力、耕畜和农具的权利。公社、生产队的一切生产措施，比如组织生产和建立大面积丰产田，应当以生产小队为单位来进行，不要打乱生产小队的“四固定”；组织小队之间或更大范围的劳力协作，也必须坚持自愿两利、等价交换的原则，由受协作的单位以工换工或评工记分，按劳付酬，不能无代价地调用小队的劳动力和其他生产资料。在“四固定”中，劳动力的固定，尤为重要，应当切实注意经常保证生产小队的劳动力的数量和质量，使小队的劳动力同交给它的基本生产任务相适应，临时抽调人力和计划外的用工，都必须尽量减少到最低限度，以免因此打乱生产小队的生产秩序，削弱农业生产第一线的力量。同时还要切实改进基本核算单位、公社以及其他领导机关对于农业生产的领导，力求避免由于指挥不当而打乱小队的作业安排，妨碍劳动力的合理使用。
    包产是“三包一奖”的中心，实行“三包一奖”制度，一定要保证包产指标落实。所谓落实，有两层意思：一是指标定得切实、恰当；一是包产指标一定要千真万确地落实到包产单位，为包产单位所接受，并且认真地照着它办。这两层是紧紧相连的，包产指标过低，不起推动生产的作用，谈不上落实；包产指标过高，包产单位失去完成的信心，不愿意接受，当然更谈不上落实。“三包一奖”制度的积极作用，在于鼓励包产单位更多地增产，超过包产指标，完成和超额完成增产计划。虽说有超产得奖、减产受罚这两方面的规定，但是，主旨在奖而不在罚，最好是大家都超产而得奖，不减产而受罚，因为多超产，对于包产单位和基本核算单位，对公社和国家，都大有好处。因此，包产指标，既要积极，又要留有余地，使包产单位有产可超，有奖可得。多年来实行“三包一奖”的经验证明，恰当的包产指标，应当是略高于平常年景下的上一年的实际产量，略低于当年可能达到的产量。这样的包产指标，经过广大社员的积极努力就可以达到并且超过，从而也就能够进一步激发社员群众的生产积极性。
    实行“三包一奖”制度，必须严肃认真，有始有终，保证奖罚严明。上面说过，包产指标必须切实、恰当，在制定“三包方案”时应当力求做到这一点，定案之后最好不再变动。一般的正常的情况下，坚持执行“三包一奖”方案固然是十分必要的，就是在有了突然的不正常的情况发生了的时候，比如发生了较大的自然灾害，也应该在适当调整“三包”指标后，仍然要坚持按方案办事。农业生产受自然界的制约的程度很大，生产过程中发生的某些重大变化，例如严重的自然灾害的袭击，往往是事先难以完全料到的。在执行“三包一奖”的过程中，发现原定指标确实无法实现的时候，不应该放弃“三包一奖”制度，而是应当发扬民主，经过出包和承包双方充分协商，根据实际情况，认真调整“三包”指标，继续坚持执行修订过后的“三包一奖”方案，不可以因为情况发生变化而使“三包一奖”半途而废。“三包一奖”是体现着党和国家的生产政策的一项重要制度，执行得好坏，关系生产很大，我们必须以严肃认真的态度来对待这个问题。
    在实行“三包一奖”当中，各级党委应当深入群众，深入实际，把政治工作和经济工作密切结合起来，把政治挂帅和物质保证密切结合起来，正确地贯彻执行各项有关的政策，大大地提高各级干部的责任心和广大社员的政治觉悟，鼓舞大家为超额完成“三包”指标和增产节约计划而奋斗。“三包一奖”制度是建立在广大社员思想觉悟不断提高的基础上的，“三包一奖”方案的制定、执行、执行情况的检查、执行结果的结算和总结，都要发动群众参加，多同群众商量，采纳群众的正确意见，并不断地加强党的思想政治工作，提高群众的社会主义和共产主义觉悟；只要做到了这些，就一定能够贯彻执行“三包一奖”的制度，把广大农民的生产积极性组织到大办农业、大办粮食的增产节约运动中去。
