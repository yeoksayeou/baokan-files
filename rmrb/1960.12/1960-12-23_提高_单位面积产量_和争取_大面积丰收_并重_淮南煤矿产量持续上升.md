    Simultaneously Emphasizing "Output Per Unit Area" and Striving for "Large-Scale Bumper Harvests"
    Huainan Coal Mine's Output Continues to Rise
    (Our newspaper, Hefei, 22nd) The Huainan Coal Mine, while increasing the output per unit area of existing mines, is actively increasing new production capacity. Since August, it has achieved high production every month. The average daily output in November increased by 6% compared to October and 24.5% compared to August, setting a new monthly production record since the mine's establishment.
    Before August this year, the Huainan Coal Mine, due to a sole emphasis on tapping the production potential of existing mines and increasing output per unit area, and failing to fully consider some unfavorable factors affecting the increase of output per unit area, stopped some small workfaces that played a considerable role in increasing production and scrapped some small shafts. After the mine reduced small shafts and small workfaces, although the output per unit area of existing large workfaces increased somewhat, when geological and other conditions changed and affected the production of large workfaces, there was no room to guarantee output. In response to this situation, the Huainan Municipal Party Committee and the Mine Party Committee immediately adopted measures to both strive to tap existing production potential, increase output per unit area, and actively add new production capacity. This has provided a practical and reliable guarantee for the increase in coal production.
    In terms of increasing new production capacity, leadership groups were established from the bureau to the mine to focus on tunneling work, concentrating efforts to make breakthroughs in new workfaces, and opening new small shafts. By the end of October, ten new workfaces and ten rebuilt small shafts had been successively put into production.
    While actively expanding new production capacity, this coal mine also strengthened its leadership over existing mines in a thorough and meticulous manner, striving to tap production potential and increase output per working face. They first concentrated their efforts on the Xinzhuangzi, Xiejiachi and other five large mines, which accounted for more than 80% of the overall output. At that time, the average monthly coal mining advance of these five large mines was only 48 meters, while the monthly advance of Xiejiachi No. 2 Mine reached 60 meters, and thirteen working faces in the five major mines reached a monthly advance of 70 meters. The leaders of the Mining Bureau promptly summarized and promoted the experience of Xiejiachi No. 2 Mine. The responsible comrades of the Mine Party Committee led more than 20 cadres to the Xinzhuangzi Mine, which had been passively producing in the previous period, to specifically help the mine solve key production problems, so that output steadily increased. The daily output in August was 7,179 tons, and by early October, it broke the 10,000-ton mark every day. The Mining Bureau also established a special hydraulic mining working group, led by the responsible comrades of the Mine Party Committee, to conduct a detailed investigation and study of the reasons for the abnormal hydraulic mining at Liyi Mine, which had more hydraulic mining problems. After repeated observations and understanding, they finally found the reason affecting hydraulic mining production, which was the short operating time of the coal-water pump. They worked with the mine's leading cadres and engineering technicians to thoroughly solve the problem, which not only enabled the water pump to quickly return to normal production, but also significantly improved the recovery rate. After this experience was promoted throughout the bureau, the operating time of the coal-water pump quickly increased from 16.45 hours per day to 21 hours, and the output per hour also increased from 47 tons to 50 tons. The daily output increased from the original 7,000 to 8,000 tons to more than 10,000 tons, and the recovery rate increased by 10%.
    In the work of focusing on large mines, the leading cadres of each mine and district concentrated their efforts on large working faces according to their respective production conditions, so as to greatly increase the output per unit area. Due to the focused and purposeful efforts to focus on large mines and large working faces, since September and October, the increase in coal production from the five major mines accounted for more than 80% of the overall increase in production, and the increase in production from large working faces accounted for more than 70% of the increase in production from the five major mines. Six working faces with a daily output of 1,000 tons appeared, and the number of working faces with a monthly output of 10,000 tons also increased from 35 to 46.

### 提高“单位面积产量”和争取“大面积丰收”并重  淮南煤矿产量持续上升

    提高“单位面积产量”和争取“大面积丰收”并重
    淮南煤矿产量持续上升
    本报合肥22日电　淮南煤矿在提高现有矿井单位面积产量的同时，积极增加新的生产能力，8月以来，月月高产，11月的平均日产量比10月增长6％，比8月增长24.5％，创造了建矿以来月产量的最高纪录。
    今年8月份以前，淮南煤矿由于单纯强调了挖掘现有矿井生产潜力，提高单位面积产量的一面，而没有充分估计到影响提高单位面积产量的一些不利因素，因此停止了一些对增产起相当作用的小工作面和报废了部分小井。全矿减少小井、小工作面后，虽然现有大工作面的单位面积产量有所提高，但遇有地质等情况的变化，大工作面生产受到影响，就没有余地保证产量。针对这一情况，淮南市委和矿党委立即采取了既努力挖掘现有生产潜力，提高单位面积产量，又积极增添新的生产能力的措施。这样，就使煤炭的增产有了切实可靠的保证。
    在增加新的生产能力方面，从局到矿都成立了领导小组，专抓掘进工作，集中力量突击新工作面，增开小井。到10月底止，已有十个新工作面和十个改建的小井陆续地投入了生产。
    这个煤矿在积极扩大新的生产能力的同时，还深入细致地加强了对现有矿井的领导，努力挖掘增产潜力，提高单位工作面产量。他们首先集中力量抓占全局产量80％以上的新庄孜、谢家集等五个大矿。当时这五个大矿的平均采煤月进尺只有四十八米，而谢家集二矿的月进尺则达六十米，五大矿还有十三个工作面达到月进尺七十米。矿务局的领导及时总结推广了谢二矿的经验。矿党委负责同志率领二十多名干部到前一时期生产一直被动的新庄孜矿，具体帮助这个矿解决生产中的关键问题，使产量稳步上升，8月产量每日为七千一百七十九吨，到10月上旬，日日突破万吨关。矿务局还专门成立了水采工作组，由矿党委负责同志率领，深入水采问题较多的李一矿仔细调查研究水采不正常的原因，经过多次观察了解，最后找到了影响水采生产的原因，是煤水泵运转时间短的问题，就会同这个矿的领导干部和工程技术人员，彻底加以解决，不仅使水泵迅速正常生产，也使回收率显著提高。全局推广这一经验后，煤水泵运转时间很快由每天十六点四五小时提高到二十一小时，每小时的产量也由四十七吨提高到五十吨，日产量由原来七、八千吨提高到万吨以上，回收率提高了10％。
    在抓大矿的工作中，各矿、区的领导干部，又根据各自生产情况，集中力量抓大工作面，以大幅度提高单位面积产量。由于有重点有目的地抓大矿和大工作面，9、10月份以来，五个大矿的煤炭增产量即占全局增产量80％以上，而大工作面的增产量又占五大矿增产量70％以上，并出现了六个日产千吨工作面，月产万吨工作面也由三十五个增加到四十六个。
