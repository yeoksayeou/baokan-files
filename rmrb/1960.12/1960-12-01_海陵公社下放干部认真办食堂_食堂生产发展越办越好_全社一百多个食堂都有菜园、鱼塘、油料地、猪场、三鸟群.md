(From Our Newspaper in Guangzhou, 30th) A large number of cadres from the Hailing Commune in Guangdong Province's Liangyang County, transferred to production teams, are implementing a strategy of grasping both production and livelihood, vigorously strengthening leadership over mess halls, so that all 111 public mess halls in the commune are getting better and better, with commune members eating well and having plenty of energy.

The Hailing Commune Party Committee emphasized that after the transferred cadres go to the small teams, they must first take on the responsibility of running the mess halls well, promoting production by improving living conditions; it stipulates that after the transferred cadres go to the mess halls, they must first do three things: first, work; second, visit; and third, teach. "Work" means taking the lead in achieving results and helping the mess halls solve specific problems; "Visit" means going deep to visit the masses and soliciting their opinions on running the mess halls well; "Teach" means conscientiously conducting ideological education for the cooks so that socialist thought takes root in the mess halls. After the transferred cadres did this, the masses praised them, and many mess halls showed a new look. For example, Chen Wenbin, Secretary of the General Party Branch of the Shitou Brigade, became a cook at the Shagang Mess Hall. He asked the masses for their opinions on the work of the mess hall, and the commune members said, "We don't worry about rice and firewood, but we lack fish and vegetables." According to the opinions of the masses, Chen Wenbin convened a meeting and mobilized the masses to discuss why they had land but did not grow vegetables, and why they did not fish near the sea. Then, he worked with the masses to expand the mess hall's vegetable garden from the past ten mu to fifty mu, and also organized four and a half laborers to catch fish and shrimp, so that the mess hall could soon have fish and vegetables to eat regularly.

After a large number of transferred cadres strengthened the work of the mess halls in the Hailing Commune, all the commune's mess halls have achieved "five haves." They have large vegetable gardens, small fish ponds, oil crop bases, pig farms, and poultry (chicken, duck, and goose) flocks. The mess halls have planted a total of 4,250 mu of vegetables (an average of 1.6 li per person), raised 1,830 pigs (an average of more than 16 per mess hall), raised 12,400 poultry, opened up 350 mu of fish ponds, and planted 1,560 mu of oil crops such as peanuts and sesame. In addition, 66 mess halls near the sea have also organized fishing groups.

Because the mess halls are well-run, the commune members have great enthusiasm, which has powerfully promoted the development of production. In the past month or so, more than 60% of the commune members in the commune have exceeded their work quotas, and work efficiency has also been greatly improved. By November 24, the commune had planted more than 19,500 mu of various winter crops, an increase of more than 3,500 mu compared with 1956, which had the largest planting area.

    海陵公社下放干部认真办食堂
    食堂生产发展越办越好
    全社一百多个食堂都有菜园、鱼塘、油料地、猪场、三鸟群
    本报广州30日电　广东省两阳县海陵公社下放到生产小队的大批干部，实行一手抓生产，一手抓生活，大力加强对食堂的领导，使全社一百一十一个公共食堂越办越好，社员吃饱吃好，干劲十足。
    海陵公社党委强调提出下放干部到小队后，必须首先把办好食堂的责任担当起来，抓生活促生产；规定下放的干部到食堂后，都首先做好三件事：一是干，二是访，三是教。“干”是带头干出成绩，帮助食堂解决具体问题；“访”是深入访问群众，征求群众对办好食堂的意见；“教”是认真作好对炊事员的思想教育，使社会主义思想在食堂生根。下放干部这样作了之后，群众纷纷叫好，许多食堂出现了一片新气象。例如，石塘大队党总支书记陈文彬到沙冈食堂当炊事员，他征求群众对食堂工作的意见，社员说：“我们不愁米和柴，只缺鱼和菜”。陈文彬根据群众的意见，便召开了会议，发动群众讨论为什么有地不种菜？近海不捕鱼？接着，他又同群众一起动手，把食堂的菜地从过去的十亩扩大到五十亩，还组织四个半劳动力捕鱼虾，使这个食堂很快就做到经常有鱼有菜吃。
    海陵公社在大批下放干部加强了食堂工作后，全社的食堂都实现了“五有”。有大菜园、有小鱼塘、有油料基地、有养猪场、有三鸟（鸡鸭鹅）群。各食堂共种下蔬菜四千二百五十亩（每人平均一分六厘），养猪一千八百三十头（每个食堂平均十六头多），养三鸟一万二千四百只，开辟鱼塘三百五十亩，种下花生、芝麻等油料作物一千五百六十亩。此外，近海的六十六个食堂，还组织了捕鱼小组。
    由于食堂办得好，社员干劲很大，有力地促进了生产的发展。近一个多月来，全社社员做工超定额的占六成多，工作效率也大大提高。到11月24日止，全社已种下各种冬种作物一万九千五百多亩，比种植面积最多的1956年还增加三千五百多亩。
