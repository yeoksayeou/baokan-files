He said: "At a time when an armed invasion of Cuba by U.S. imperialism may erupt at any moment, and when the heroic Cuban people, filled with anger, are ready to shed their last drop of blood to defend their motherland, the Vietnamese people and government will go all out to support the heroic and certain-to-be-victorious struggle of the fraternal Cuban people."

Hector Rodriguez Llompart, head of the Cuban Revolutionary Government delegation, in his speech, warmly praised the Vietnamese people's unyielding struggle against colonialism throughout history.

He said, "All the Cuban people, the working class, and the peasants, as well as true patriots, are uniting under the leadership of Prime Minister Castro, resolutely fighting against the U.S. imperialist lackey dictators and for the construction of an independent, democratic, peaceful, and happy country."
