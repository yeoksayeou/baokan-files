Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 24th: The press here attaches great importance to and welcomes the implementation measures of the treaty on dual nationality between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of Indonesia, which were announced today. Some newspapers today published the full text of the implementation measures, some started continuous publication from today, and some announced that they will publish the full text soon.

    《Dawn Daily》 also published an editorial today welcoming the publication of the implementation measures for the treaty on dual nationality between China and Indonesia. The editorial pointed out that with the signing of this implementation measure, things that certain groups often use to sow discord between Indonesia and China will disappear.

    The newspaper said that the imperialists are certainly greatly disappointed because what they hope for is not the unity and friendship between Indonesia and China, but their disputes and opposition. The imperialists also know for sure that the unity and harmony of these two major Asian countries will constitute a force that they cannot undermine and fool.

    The editorial expressed the hope that in implementing this measure, both parties will help each other and show mutual understanding in the spirit expressed in the preamble of this measure.

    The newspaper finally expressed the hope that the agreement reached between Indonesia and China on the issue of dual nationality will become an example for Asian and African countries facing the same problem.

    《Hope Daily》, published in Medan, published an editorial on the 17th saying that the signing of the implementation measures for the treaty on dual nationality between Indonesia and China proves the superiority of the Bandung spirit and is conducive to strengthening the unity between Asian and African countries. Especially in the current struggle against the imperialists and colonialists' attempts to split Asian and African countries, this kind of unity is particularly needed.

    The editorial said that what Indonesia and China need is friendship, not division. Strengthening the friendship between the two countries means the victory of opposing imperialism and defending world peace, which is a blow to imperialism.

    中国和印度尼西亚加强友谊有利于和平
    印度尼西亚报纸欢迎双重国籍问题条约实施办法
    据新华社雅加达24日电　这里报界十分重视并欢迎今天公布的中华人民共和国政府和印度尼西亚政府关于双重国籍问题的条约的实施办法。有的报纸今天刊登了实施办法的全文，有的从今天起开始连续发表，有的宣布即将全文刊载。
    《黎明日报》今天还发表社论，欢迎中国和印度尼西亚关于双重国籍问题的条约的实施办法的公布。社论指出，随着这个实施办法的签订，某些集团常常利用来在印度尼西亚和中国之间散布不和的东西将会消失。
    报纸说，帝国主义者当然大失所望，因为他们所希望的并不是印度尼西亚和中国的团结友好，而是它们之间的纷争和对立。帝国主义者也的确知道，这两个亚洲大国的团结融洽将构成一种他们无法破坏和愚弄的力量。
    社论表示希望，在实施这个办法时，双方将本着这个办法序言中表现的精神，彼此帮助，显示互相谅解。
    报纸最后表示希望，印度尼西亚和中国就双重国籍问题达成的协议，将成为面临同样问题的亚非国家的榜样。
    棉兰出版的《希望报》17日发表社论说，印度尼西亚和中国关于双重国籍条约实施办法的签订证明了万隆精神的优越性，并且有利于加强亚非国家间的团结。尤其在当前反对帝国主义者和殖民主义者企图分裂亚非国家的阴谋的斗争中，这种团结是特别需要的。
    社论说，印度尼西亚和中国需要的是友谊，而不是分裂。加强两国的友谊意味着反对帝国主义和保卫世界和平的胜利，也就是对帝国主义的打击。
