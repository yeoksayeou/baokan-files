Increasing revenue and reducing expenditure are two interconnected and mutually promoting aspects of developing production. With diligence, production can be continuously improved; with thrift, products can be used appropriately and costs can be continuously reduced. In the past two years, the Shangxing Brigade of the Shajing Commune in Bao'an County, Guangdong Province, although achieving increased production year after year, did not see a significant increase in the income of its members because it neglected the work of thrift. This year, the brigade paid attention to both diligence and thrift, ensuring that 98% of the members increased their income, which greatly encouraged the members' enthusiasm for labor and created more favorable conditions for striving for a greater harvest next year. Diligence and thrift must be grasped simultaneously - this is the beneficial enlightenment we have gained from the Shangxing Brigade.

    开源节流不可偏废
    勤和俭是发展生产的两个相互联系、相互促进的方面。有了勤，生产才能不断提高，有了俭，产品才能用之得当、成本才能不断降低。广东宝安县沙井公社上星大队，过去两年虽然连年增产，但是由于忽视节约工作，社员收入反而增加不多；今年这个大队注意了勤、俭一齐抓，就保证了98％的社员都增加了收入，从而大大地鼓舞了社员的劳动热情，为争取明年更大丰收创造了更有利的条件。勤和俭必须同时抓好——这是我们从上星大队所得到的有益启示。
