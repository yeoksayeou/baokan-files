    Handing the "Ladle Handle" to Our Own People
    Xie Wanyin, Party Branch Secretary of the First Production Team, Beiquan Brigade, Yanghe People's Commune, Yongning County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region

    In July, when I first arrived at the team to serve as the Party Branch Secretary, I wasn't yet familiar with the work. The team's cook, Ma Lin, had also just been transferred from the brigade, and I didn't know anything about his situation. I heard that the commune members had many complaints about the cook Ma Lin's work. What should I do? Just then, I saw in the Party newspaper the instructions from the Party Central Committee, which said: "To grasp livelihood, the first thing to do is to grasp the canteen well, and rely on poor and lower-middle peasants to organize committees and let them be masters of their own affairs..." At this time, the brigade Party General Branch and comrades from the Autonomous Region working group also suggested that I grasp both production and livelihood. So, I made up my mind to immediately start rectifying the work of the canteen.

    Later, I learned about Ma Lin's background. It turned out that he used to be a small business owner, running a restaurant in the street before liberation, and he hadn't properly engaged in labor since liberation. My mind cleared up instantly. Just as the masses said, how could we hand the "ladle handle" to someone like that! After discussion at the team cadre meeting and asking for instructions from the higher-ups, I immediately convened a mass meeting of the entire team to discuss how to improve the work of the canteen.

    The day of the meeting was really lively. First, based on everyone's opinions, we removed Ma Lin and other cooks and administrators with impure backgrounds and poor work attitudes from their positions. When I said to the commune members: "We will follow the instructions of the Party Central Committee and establish a poor and lower-middle peasant canteen management committee, and select two poor peasant committee members who are of good quality, have good thoughts, are good at labor, are fair in handling affairs, and are considered reliable by everyone to live in the canteen, participate in labor, and supervise the work of the canteen. What do you think?"

    Everyone agreed with this proposal as soon as they heard it. Some people said, "That's right, no matter how good the Party's policy is, without good people, how can good things be done!" At this time, everyone was eager to propose their favorite people to be committee members. Some said, "I choose Zhang Ke, he is a poor peasant, and even though he is old, he can not only cook but also works very seriously." Some said, "I choose Aunt Wu, she can endure hardship and is willing to do things for everyone." "I choose..."

    Zhang Ke and Aunt Wu were elected. Before liberation, they were both poor peasants who suffered from hunger and hardship. After they were elected as committee members, they thought: the Party and the masses have entrusted us with such an important task, we must not fail everyone's expectations! They are really enthusiastic and devoted to the work of the canteen.

    At the beginning, they took the initiative to solicit the opinions of the commune members on the food. This made the commune members very happy. They said to the two old people with joy and affection, "Uncle Zhang, in the past, we always worked hard in production, but Ma Lin and the others always cooked the same thing three times a day, and everyone was tired of it. The food needs to be adjusted frequently!" "Aunt Wu, it's not appropriate for the elderly and children in our team to eat the same food as the commune members. Do you think it's possible to make some soft food for them separately?"...

    The two committee members collected everyone's opinions and came to me to discuss them. We proposed and studied many ways to improve the work of the canteen at the committee meeting. First, we decided to establish a food menu, plan for five days, announce it every two days, and make sure it was different every day. Each time, the two committee members would solicit the opinions of the commune members and then hand them over to the team cadres and cooks for research and decision-making; second, we implemented one hall and two stoves, and used fine grains to make soft food and nutritious food for the elderly, children, the sick, and pregnant women separately every day...

    Although Grandpa Zhang had never cooked dishes in a restaurant like Ma Lin, he often pondered about changing the variety of food, not only to make the commune members full, but also to eat well, eat clean and hygienic food, and save food. Grandpa Zhang thought when cooking noodles, why didn't everyone like the vegetable noodles that Ma Lin used to cook? It turned out that he was too lazy and tried to save trouble. He put the vegetables and noodles together when cooking, and cooked a pot of mush, with no vegetable taste or noodle taste. Grandpa Zhang thought, vegetables are delicious when they are stir-fried. If the vegetables are stir-fried first, and then the vegetables are added after the noodles are cooked, would it be more delicious? He made a bowl of vegetable noodles according to this method, and the commune members said after eating it: "This noodle tastes very good!" Grandpa Zhang will follow this method to cook vegetable noodles every time without fear of trouble.

    Although Aunt Wu is old, she is careful and quick in her work. She always works in the kitchen early and late every day. When the cooks go to eat, she is still busy washing pots and dishes, washing everything clean, and even wiping the stove until it is shiny.

    Since rectifying the organization of the canteen management personnel, implementing democratic management, and strictly implementing the system of fixing quotas based on people, allocating indicators to households, allocating grain to the hall, eating with tickets, and returning savings to oneself, the work of the canteen in our team has been greatly improved. Are the commune members satisfied? Hey, needless to say. You just have to look at how happy they are when they enter the canteen. They say: The Party's method is good. The poor and lower-middle peasant canteen management committee was established, and the "ladle handle" was handed over to our own people. Our lives are getting better and better! We are becoming more and more energetic in our work!

### 把“勺把子”交给自己人

    把“勺把子”交给自己人
    中共宁夏回族自治区永宁养和人民公社北全大队第一生产队支部书记  谢万银
    7月份，我刚到队上担任党支部书记时，因对工作还不熟悉；队上的炊事员马林也是刚刚由大队调来的，我对他的情况一点也不了解。听到社员们对炊事员马林的工作意见很多，怎办呢？刚好我从党报上看到了党中央的指示，说：抓生活，首先就要抓好食堂，要依靠贫农、下中农组织委员会，由他们当家作主……这时，大队党总支和自治区工作组的同志也提出了要我一手抓生产、一手抓生活的意见，于是我就下决心，立刻着手整顿食堂的工作。
    以后我了解了一下马林的历史，原来他以前是个小业主，解放前在街上开馆子，解放后一直没好好劳动过；我的心里一下子就亮堂了。正像群众说的，我们怎能把“勺把子”交给这号人呢！经过队干部会议讨论和向上级请示以后，我立刻召开了全队的群众大会，和大家商量改进食堂的工作。
    开会的那天可真热闹。首先根据大家的意见，撤除了马林同其他成份不纯和工作态度不好的炊事员和管理员的职务。当我对社员们说：“我们按照党中央指示的那样，成立贫农、下中农食堂管理委员会，选两个品质好、思想好、劳动好、办事公正、大家认为可靠的贫农委员，专门住在食堂里，边参加劳动，边监督食堂工作，你们看好不好呀？”
    大家一听这提议都表示赞成。有人说：“对着哩，党的政策再好，没有好人，怎能办好事！”这时大家都争着提出自己中意的人来当委员，有的说：“我选张科，他是贫农，别看他年纪大，他不但会做菜烧饭，做事还特别认真负责。”有的说：“我选吴姨妈，她能吃苦，肯替大家办事。”“我选……”
    张科和吴姨妈当选了。他俩解放前都是受苦挨饿的贫农。他俩被选为委员以后，就想：党和群众把这么重要的任务交给咱，咱可不能辜负大家的期望啊！他俩对食堂的工作可真是积极热心。
    一开始，他们就主动地去征求社员们对伙食的意见。这一来，社员们可都乐了。他们又高兴又亲热地对两位老人说：“张大爷，以往咱在生产上天天鼓干劲，马林他们做饭老是一天三调和，大家都吃腻了，生活得经常调剂调剂啊！”“吴姨妈，咱队老人和娃娃同社员吃一号饭不合适。你看，单另给他们做些软饭能行不能行？”……
    两位委员搜集了大伙的意见，就来找我商量。我们在委员会上提出研究了好多改进食堂工作的办法，首先决定建立饭谱，五天一计划，两天一公布，每天不重样。每次由两位委员征求社员意见以后，交给队干部和炊事人员研究决定执行；第二是实行一堂两灶，每天用细粮单另给老人、娃娃、病号和产妇做软饭、营养饭……
    张大爷虽然以前没像马林一样在馆子里炒过菜，可是他经常琢磨着变换饮食的花样，不但要使社员吃得饱，还要吃得好，吃得干净卫生，还节省粮食。张大爷在煮面时寻思，为啥以前马林煮的菜面大家不喜欢吃呢，原来他太懒惰，图省事，煮面时菜面一齐下，煮的一锅糊糊，菜没菜味，面没面味。张大爷心里想，菜是炒的好吃，要是先把菜炒好，等面煮好再下菜，是不是会好吃些呢？他就照着这个办法做了一回菜面，社员们吃了都说：“这面的味道好得很哩！”老张以后每次就都不怕麻烦地按照这办法煮菜面。
    吴姨妈尽管年纪大了，可是干起活来又细心又麻利，她每天总是起早贪黑地在灶房劳动着，炊事员都吃饭去了，她还忙着洗锅洗碗，把啥都洗得干干净净，就连锅台也揩得油光发亮。
    自从整顿了炊事管理人员的组织、实行民主管理和严格执行以人定量、指标到户、粮食到堂、凭票吃饭、节约归己的制度以后，咱队食堂的工作是大大改进了。你问社员们满意不满意？嗨，那还用说。你只要看看他们进食堂时的那股高兴劲儿就知道了。他们说：党的办法就是好，成立了贫农、下中农食堂管理委员会，把“勺把子”交给了自己人，咱们的生活越过越美气啦！干活也越来越有劲啦！
