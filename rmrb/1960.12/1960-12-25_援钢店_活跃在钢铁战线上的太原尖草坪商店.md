	"Aid Steel Store"
	——The Taiyuan Jiancaoping Store Active on the Steel Front

　　The Jiancaoping Store is a large comprehensive store mainly serving Taiyuan Iron and Steel (TISCO), and is a model unit on Shanxi Province's financial and trade front. Since the beginning of this year, under the leadership of the store's Party committee, the employees have studied and promoted the advanced experience of the Tongjialiang Store, organized aid-steel supply professional teams and employee economic life professional teams, and penetrated into the front line of TISCO production and employee dormitory areas, trying every means to expand the scope of business and fully support the increase in steel production. In order to deliver goods to the door, the store moved the original production materials and daily necessities supply stations to the vicinity of TISCO; the number of fixed stores set up on construction sites and next to furnaces increased from twenty-one to fifty-eight. In addition, a mobile service supply team of more than 120 people was formed to sell goods on construction sites and in workshops on a regular basis. Because the store employees closely cooperated with the work arrangements of the TISCO Party committee, they maximized the continuous leap forward of TISCO's production through their business activities, and were unanimously praised by TISCO employees as "good logistics" for production and "good housekeepers" for life, and were praised as the "Aid Steel Store" loved by everyone.

	When TISCO employees hold commendation and award conferences, they invite store employees to participate, and the units that win the red flag also thank the store employees. Because they know that every ton of steel produced by TISCO is injected with the glorious labor of the Jiancaoping Store employees.
	Before TISCO overhauls the blast furnace, the store's supply station delivers the prepared materials to the front of the furnace.
	In order to ensure that steel workers eat hot meals and hot dishes, the four restaurants in the Jiancaoping Store located in the factory provide free heating services for workers. This is the coking plant restaurant distributing heated meals to workers.
	The store's life service station helps TISCO employees' families carry out services such as dismantling, washing, sewing, and mending, and helps single employees arrange their lives well.

    “援钢店”
    ——活跃在钢铁战线上的太原尖草坪商店
　　尖草坪商店是一个主要为太钢服务的大型综合商店，是山西省财贸战线上的标兵单位。今年以来，职工们在商店党委的领导下，学习并推广了同家梁商店的先进经验，组织了援钢供应专业队和职工经济生活专业队，深入太钢生产第一线和职工宿舍区，千方百计扩大业务范围，全力支援钢铁增产。为了做到送货上门，商店把原有的生产资料和生活资料供应站搬到太钢附近；设在工地、炉旁的固定门市部由二十一个增加到五十八个。另外还组成了一百二十多人的流动服务供应队伍，经常在工地、车间流动售货。由于商店职工紧密配合太钢党委的工作部署，通过自己的业务活动最大限度地促进了太钢生产的持续跃进，被太钢职工一致称赞为生产的“好后勤”、生活的“好管家”，并被誉为人人喜爱的“援钢店”。    新华社记者　花　皑摄（附图片）
    太钢职工每次召开评比发奖大会的时候，都请商店职工参加，获得红旗的单位还向商店职工致谢。因为他们知道，在太钢生产的每一吨钢里，都注入了尖草坪商店职工的光荣劳动
    太钢在检修高炉以前，商店供应站便把准备好的各种需用物资送到炉前
    为了保证钢铁工人吃到热饭、热菜，尖草坪商店设在厂内的四个饭店义务代工人热饭。这是焦炉饭店正给工人分发代热的饭菜
    商店生活服务站帮助太钢职工家属开展拆洗缝补等服务工作，帮助单身职工安排好生活
