U.S. imperialism is pushing Laos into a fiery abyss of full-scale civil war. The army of the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group, equipped by the United States, is openly attacking and invading Vientiane, the capital of the Kingdom of Laos, under the direct command of U.S. officers and with the participation of Thai troops. At the same time, U.S. imperialism and the Thai reactionaries illegally established the Phoumi-Boun Oum puppet government in Savannakhet as a tool for their interference and aggression in Laos. U.S. imperialism has embarked on the dangerous road of open aggression against Laos, creating a new threat to peace in Indochina, peace in Southeast Asia, and world peace.

Regarding this aggressive crime of U.S. imperialism that threatens peace, our government issued a statement on the 14th, condemning it severely, and solemnly stated that "the Chinese government firmly supports the policy of peace, neutrality, national independence, and national unity of the Kingdom of Laos, and firmly supports the just struggle of the Lao patriotic people against the interference and aggression of U.S. imperialism." In recent days, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Premier Pham Van Dong have successively issued statements condemning U.S. imperialism's interference in Laos and calling on relevant countries to take urgent and effective actions to stop it. The Soviet government has also sent a note to the U.S. government, giving a strong condemnation. Our government has expressed its full support for the solemn position of the Soviet government and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the Lao issue, and will resolutely work with the Soviet Union, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and other countries concerned with maintaining peace in Indochina and Asia to make the greatest efforts to safeguard the Geneva Accords and stop U.S. imperialism's interference in Laos' internal affairs.

The current serious situation in Laos is a bright mirror. It once again clearly shows the demonic shadow of U.S. imperialism, this neo-colonialism. Since July 1958, when U.S. imperialism overthrew the Phouma government, which pursued a policy of peace and neutrality, it has tried its best to support the pro-American traitorous group in Laos, gradually intensifying its penetration into Laos and turning Laos into a new colony and base of aggression for the United States. U.S. imperialism has undermined the Geneva Accords, disrupted peace within Laos, and brought ever-deepening disasters to the Lao people. The U.S. imperialist policy of aggression against Laos cannot but be resisted by the broad masses of the Lao people. The coup launched on August 9th by the coup committee headed by Captain Kong Le was able to overthrow the pro-American traitorous government in one fell swoop and re-establish the Phouma government, which pursued a policy of peace, neutrality, and national reconciliation, precisely reflecting the will of the broad masses of the Lao people. However, U.S. imperialism, the main fortress of world reactionary forces, the international gendarme, and the heinous neo-colonialist, is not reconciled to failure. For four months, it has reorganized the disintegrated pro-American traitorous forces in Laos, from implementing economic blockades to exerting political pressure, from instigating riots to threatening with force, conspiring to subvert the legitimate Phouma government that maintains national independence, pursues peace and neutrality, and promotes national harmony. Until recently, the Nosavan rebel army, under the command of U.S. officers and with the participation of Thai, Ngo Dinh Diem, and Chiang Kai-shek group troops, launched a fierce attack on the Lao capital Vientiane from Thailand across the Mekong River.

The flames of civil war in Laos, ignited by U.S. imperialism, are spreading. The Lao people are facing a rampant offensive by the Lao reactionaries directly supported by U.S. imperialism. The situation is serious, and the struggle is arduous. However, in the past four months, the patriotic forces of the Lao people have developed rapidly, and the broad masses of the people have raised their awareness and strengthened their unity in the struggle for peace, neutrality, national independence, and national unity. The broad masses of the people have further recognized their enemies from the rampant interference of U.S. imperialism and the Thai reactionary authorities, and from the sinful activities of the Phoumi Nosavan group in betraying the motherland and selling out national interests. A nationwide struggle against U.S. interference and aggression and against the Nosavan pro-American traitorous group is rising.

The soldiers and civilians of Vientiane have displayed a heroic spirit of tenacious fighting in resisting the attack of the Nosavan rebels under the command of U.S. interventionists. Captain Kong Le, Chairman of the Lao Coup Committee, called on the people to rise up and fight for the Lao nation. He said that the Lao people "would rather die than be slaves to the barbaric colonial system of U.S. imperialism and Thailand, nor be exploited by the Phoumi Nosavan-Kou Voravong-Abhay traitorous group." The Lao Fighting Units have closely cooperated with the Lao Royal Government army, fighting shoulder to shoulder to resist the rebels. All patriotic and progressive forces in Laos have further united in the face of the offensive of U.S. imperialism and the reactionaries.

The Lao rebel group's attack on Vientiane is a signal that U.S. imperialism is determined to expand the civil war in Laos and vainly attempt to extinguish the Lao people's patriotic and just struggle. To this end, the Supreme Command of the Lao Fighting Units Armed Forces issued an order on the 12th to cadres and soldiers of the national troops and people's armed forces, calling on the people of the whole country to act, defend the motherland, defend the policy of peace, neutrality, and national harmony, and vigorously support the government of Prince Souvanna Phouma. The Supreme Command of the Lao Fighting Units also ordered all cadres, soldiers, and guerrillas to continue to comprehensively develop the struggle throughout the country, vigorously promote guerrilla warfare; closely cooperate with the government army and armed forces in Vientiane, resolutely resist any offensive by the Phoumi-Boun Oum rebel group army, and eliminate the enemy's effective strength by all means; launch offensives against the enemy's strongholds in Xieng Khouang, central Laos, and lower Laos; universally and vigorously develop guerrilla warfare, block and cut off the enemy's supplies, harass the main force of the enemy army in various places, and deplete its effective strength; overthrow the forces of the traitorous group, and drive the U.S. interventionists out of Laos. In recent days, youths from all over Laos have risen to respond to this call. Youths of various ethnic groups such as Lao Soung, Lao Thoeng, and Lao Loum in Vientiane, Xieng Khouang, and southern Laos have enthusiastically gone to the front to defend the motherland. Youths in rural areas have also organized youth armed teams, taken up weapons, and defended their villages.

The patriotic and just struggle of the Lao people is not isolated. Socialist countries and peace-loving people all over the world stand on the side of the Lao people. The Lao people's struggle to safeguard national independence, strive for the implementation of a policy of peace and neutrality, and realize national unity is an integral part of the struggle against U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and war, to safeguard peace in Indochina, safeguard peace in Asia, and safeguard the cause of world peace. The Chinese people resolutely support the just struggle of the Lao patriotic people against the interference and aggression of U.S. imperialism. We firmly believe that the Lao people's patriotic and just struggle will surely win final victory!

    坚决支持老挝人民反对美国侵略的爱国正义斗争
    美帝国主义正在把老挝推向全面内战的火海。美国装备的富米·诺萨万叛乱集团的军队，在美国军官的直接指挥下和泰国军队的参加下，公然进攻并侵入老挝王国的首都万象。同时，美帝国主义和泰国反动派在沙湾拿吉非法成立了富米—文翁傀儡政府，作为它们干涉和侵略老挝的工具。美帝国主义已经开始走上了公开侵略老挝的危险道路，造成了对印度支那和平、东南亚和平、世界和平的新威胁。
    对于美帝国主义这一威胁和平的侵略罪行，我国政府14日发表声明，加以严厉谴责，并严正表示“中国政府坚决支持老挝王国的和平中立、民族独立和国家统一的政策，坚决支持老挝爱国人民为反对美帝国主义的干涉和侵略所进行的正义斗争”。最近几天，越南民主共和国外交部和范文同总理相继发表声明，谴责美帝国主义对老挝的干涉，并且呼吁有关国家采取紧急和有效行动加以制止。苏联政府也照会美国政府，给予强有力的谴责。我国政府已表示完全支持苏联政府和越南民主共和国政府关于老挝问题的严正立场，并将坚决地同苏联、越南民主共和国和其他关心维护印度支那和亚洲和平的国家一道，尽最大的努力来维护日内瓦协议和制止美帝国主义对老挝内政的干涉。
    目前老挝的严重局势是一面明亮的镜子。它又一次清晰地显现了美帝国主义这个新殖民主义的魔影。自从1958年7月，美帝国主义颠覆了奉行和平中立政策的富马政府以后，竭力扶植老挝亲美卖国集团，步步加紧渗入老挝，把老挝变成美国的新殖民地和侵略基地。美帝国主义破坏了日内瓦协议，破坏了老挝国内的和平，给老挝人民带来日益深重的灾难。美帝国主义对老挝的侵略政策，不能不遭到老挝广大人民的反抗。今年8月9日以贡勒大尉为首的政变委员会所发动的政变，所以能够在广大人民的支持下，一举推翻亲美卖国政府，重新成立了奉行和平中立政策的富马政府，正是反映了老挝广大人民的意志。但是，美帝国主义这一世界反动势力的主要堡垒、国际宪兵、万恶的新殖民主义者并不甘心失败。四个月来，它重新组织起老挝瓦解了的亲美卖国势力，从实行经济封锁到施加政治压力、从策动暴乱到武力威胁，阴谋颠覆维护民族独立、奉行和平中立和民族和睦政策的富马合法政府。以至最近，在美国军官指挥下，有泰国、吴庭艳和蒋介石集团军队参加的诺萨万叛军，以泰国为基地，渡过湄公河向老挝首都万象发动猛烈的进攻。
    美帝国主义一手点燃的老挝内战的战火，正在蔓延。老挝人民面临着有美帝国主义直接支持的老挝反动派猖狂进攻。形势是严重的，斗争是艰巨的。但是，四个月来，老挝人民的爱国力量得到了迅速的发展，广大人民在争取和平中立、民族独立和国家统一的斗争中，觉悟提高了，团结加强了。广大人民从美帝国主义和泰国反动当局的猖狂干涉中，从富米·诺萨万集团的背叛祖国和出卖民族利益的罪恶活动中，进一步认清了自己的敌人。一场全民的反对美国干涉和侵略、反对诺萨万亲美卖国集团的斗争，正在兴起。
    万象军民，在抗击美国干涉者指挥下的诺萨万叛军的进攻中，显示出顽强战斗的英勇气概。老挝政变委员会主席贡勒大尉号召人民，起来为老挝民族而战。他说，老挝人民“宁死也不愿作美帝国主义和泰国的野蛮的殖民制度的奴隶，也不愿受到富米·诺萨万—库·帕西·阿贝叛国集团的剥削”。寮国战斗部队已经同老挝王国政府军队密切配合，肩并肩地抗击叛军。老挝一切的爱国进步力量，在美帝国主义和反动派的进攻面前，进一步团结起来了。
    老挝叛乱集团向万象的进攻，是美帝国主义决心扩大老挝内战，妄想扑灭老挝人民爱国正义斗争的信号。为此，寮国战斗部队武装力量最高司令部12日已向全国部队和人民武装力量的干部和战士发布命令，号召老挝全国人民行动起来，保卫祖国、保卫和平中立、民族和睦的政策，大力支持梭发那·富马亲王政府。寮国战斗部队最高司令部并命令全体干部、战士和游击队，继续全面发展全国的斗争，大力推进游击战争；在万象密切配合政府军和武装力量，坚决抗击富米—文翁叛乱集团军队的任何进攻，用一切办法消灭敌人的有生力量；在川圹、中寮和下寮向敌人的据点发动攻势；普遍地、大力地发展游击战争，封锁和切断敌人的供应，对各地敌军的主力进行骚扰，消耗其有生力量；打倒叛国集团的势力，把美国干涉者从老挝赶出去。连日以来，老挝各地青年奋起响应这一号召。万象、川圹和老挝南部各地的寮松、寮听和寮龙等各族青年，踊跃走向前方，保卫祖国。各地农村的青年也组织起青年武装队，拿起武器，捍卫村庄。
    老挝人民的爱国正义斗争，不是孤立的。社会主义国家和全世界爱好和平人民，都站在老挝人民这一边。老挝人民维护民族独立、争取实行和平中立政策、实现祖国统一的斗争，是反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策、维护印度支那和平、维护亚洲和平、维护世界和平事业的一个组成部分。中国人民坚决支持老挝爱国人民为反对美帝国主义的干涉和侵略所进行的正义斗争。我们深信，老挝人民的爱国正义斗争，必将获得最后胜利！
