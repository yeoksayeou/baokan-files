Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 13th: In the process of victoriously implementing the magnificent Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965), the development speed of the Soviet steel industry has been continuously accelerated, and this year's steel production tasks stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan will be greatly overfulfilled. The gap with the United States in terms of steel production has been greatly narrowed. According to materials recently published in the Soviet press, the growth rate of Soviet pig iron and steel production in the nearly two years since the start of the Seven-Year Plan has accelerated by 50% compared with the average annual growth rate in the previous four years (1955-1958), and by approximately 6% to 30% compared with the original average annual rate set by the Seven-Year Plan's control figures.

The Seven-Year Plan's control figures stipulate that during the seven years from 1959 to 1965, Soviet pig iron should increase by an average of 7.3%-8.5% annually, and steel should increase by 6.6%-7.5%. Thanks to the continuous efforts of the broad masses of Soviet steelworkers in the race to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule, constantly tapping production potential, improving technical levels, and increasing labor productivity, the actual growth rates achieved for these two important products in the past year and the first three quarters of this year have each increased to 9%. In the four years from 1955 to 1958, the average annual growth rate of these two products was 6%; compared with 1957-1958, the average annual growth rate of these two products in the past two years will increase by 88% and 70% respectively, while the growth rate of steel will increase by 50%. In October of this year, Soviet steel production climbed to an even higher peak, with monthly output reaching over 5.6 million tons. This is much higher than the average monthly output for the entire past year, and also higher than the average monthly output for any quarter in the first nine months or first three quarters of this year.

This good situation stands in stark contrast to the American steel industry, which is in a new production crisis this year. According to reports from American news agencies, from January to August of this year, American steel industry production fell by about 30%. The situation has further deteriorated in recent months.

After the expansion of the production base and the acceleration of the development speed, last year, the net increase in Soviet steel production reached 5 million tons, creating an unprecedented record in the history of the Soviet steel industry. This record will be broken again this year, reaching more than 5.1 million tons. It is estimated that this year's Soviet steel industry production plan will likely be overfulfilled, bringing pig iron production to over 47 million tons, and steel production will break through the 60 million ton mark for the first time, reaching around 65 million tons, and reaching over 70 million tons next year. According to Soviet press reports, this year the Soviet Union will produce a total of about 3 million tons more steel than the Seven-Year Plan's control figures, nearly 3 million tons of steel, and a large amount of pig iron.

The steelworkers' high enthusiasm for continuously improving production technology and steadily increasing labor productivity is an important reason for the greatly accelerated production speed of the steel industry in the past two years. Since the beginning of last year, they have been actively tapping potential and increasingly extensively and deeply launching a competition to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Since the beginning of this year, they have further created many new production records and new production achievements, continuously improving production technology, reducing costs, and increasing labor productivity. In the Soviet Union's largest Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works, not long ago, each blast furnace averaged six heats of pig iron per day and night, but now it has been raised to an average of eight heats. Open-hearth furnace workers created two production records in May alone. They shortened the furnace repair time after every 400-500 heats of steel from the past three to seven days and nights to two to six days and nights, thereby accelerating steel production and producing 9.22 tons of steel per square meter of hearth area, exceeding the steelmaking records of all Western countries, including the United States. In the Cherepovets Steel Works, an important steel industry center in the Northwest region, the working team led by Communist Party members Yashenko and Antonov used advanced technologies such as high top pressure and high-temperature blast, producing 16,600 tons of pig iron for the country in the first nine months of this year, exceeding the plan. In October, they further created an unprecedented record, making the utilization coefficient of the effective volume of the blast furnace reach 0.542, which is much higher than the average record of 0.771 for the entire Soviet Union last year.

Continuously expanding and rapidly carrying out capital construction, enabling the production capacity of the steel industry to increase rapidly, is another important reason for the significant achievements made by the Soviet steel industry in the past two years, especially this year. For example, from 1959 to November of this year, the Soviet Union has built seven new blast furnaces and more open-hearth furnaces and rolling mill equipment. The equipment put into production in this year alone can produce 4.8 million tons of iron, 4.3 million tons of steel, and 5 million tons of steel annually. As everyone knows, on the other side of the ocean, the American monopoly capital reveals that it obviously does not have the ability to utilize the existing productive forces. At present, less than 50% of the existing steel industry production capacity in the United States is being utilized.

According to statistics from Schwartz, a commentator for the American *New York Times*, in the first three quarters of this year, Soviet steel production has been narrowing the gap with the United States month by month. In the third quarter, the steel production of the two countries was very close, at 16.3 million tons and 17.7 million tons respectively. After analyzing the steel industry production situation in the third quarter of the Soviet Union and the United States, Schwartz wrote uneasily: "What worries American experts is that... the Soviet Union is now producing almost as much steel as the United States."

According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch on the 13th, TASS reported: Filipov, an expert from the Soviet State Planning Committee, recently declared at a meeting that the Soviet Union's coke production has now exceeded that of the United States, and the level of mechanization in the coking furnace production process is also higher than that of the United States. Due to the increase in coke production in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, the coke production of the socialist camp countries will account for 40% of the world's total coke production this year.

He said that in the past decade, the production capacity of the Soviet coking industry has more than doubled. In order to meet the ever-growing needs of the steel industry and other production departments for coke, by the end of the Seven-Year Plan in 1965, the Soviet Union will also build 53 new coking furnaces and renovate many existing coking furnaces.

    十年来焦炭工业生产能力增加一倍以上　焦炭产量现已超过美国
    新华社莫斯科13日电　在胜利执行宏伟的七年计划（1959—1965年）的过程中，苏联钢铁工业发展速度不断加快，七年计划规定的今年钢铁生产任务将大大超额完成。在钢的生产量方面，同美国的差距已经大大缩短了。根据苏联报刊最近以来发表的材料计算，七年计划开始以来将近两年中，苏联生铁和钢的产量增长速度，已比去年以前四年（1955—1958年）中的年平均增长速度加快了50％，比七年计划控制数字原定年平均速度加快了大约6％至30％左右。
    七年计划控制数字规定，在1959—1965年七年中，苏联生铁每年平均应增长7.3％—8.5％，钢应增长6.6％—7.5％。由于苏联广大钢铁工人在争取提前完成七年计划的竞赛中，不断挖掘生产潜力，提高技术水平和劳动生产率，在去年全年和今年头三个季度中，这两种重要产品实际上达到的增长速度则各提高为9％。而在1955至1958年四年中，这两种产品的年平均发展速度都是6％；同1957年—1958年比较，去年和今年两年内这两种产品的年平均增长速度则将分别提高88％和70％，而钢材增长速度则将提高50％。今年10月份，苏联钢产量攀上了更高的高峰，月产量达到五百六十万吨以上。这既大大高于去年全年的月平均产量，也高于今年头九个月和头三季度任何一季度的月平均产量。
    这种良好形势，同处于新的生产危机中的今年美国钢铁工业，恰成一强烈对比。据美国通讯社报道，从今年1月到8月，美国钢铁工业生产即下降了30％左右。最近几个月，又进一步恶化了。
    生产基数扩大、发展速度加快后，去年，苏联钢产量纯增加额达到五百万吨，创造了苏联钢铁工业史上的空前纪录。而在今年，这一纪录又将被突破，而将达到五百一十万吨以上。据预计，今年苏联钢铁工业生产计划，将可能超额完成，使生铁产量达到四千七百万吨以上，使钢产量第一次突破六千万吨大关，达到六千五百万吨左右，并在明年达到七千万吨以上。据苏联报刊报道，今年苏联将比七年计划控制数字总共多生产约三百万吨钢，将近三百万吨钢材和大量生铁。
    钢铁工人热情高涨地不断改进生产技术，节节提高劳动生产率是两年来钢铁工业生产速度大大加快的重要原因。从去年年初起，他们就积极挖掘潜力，日益广泛深入地展开了争取提前完成七年计划的竞赛运动。今年以来，他们进一步创造了不少新生产纪录、新的生产成就，不断改善生产技术、降低成本和提高劳动生产率。在苏联最大的马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁联合工厂，不久以前平均每座高炉每昼夜炼六炉生铁，而现在已平均提高到八炉。平炉工人在5月一个月内就创造了两个生产纪录，他们把每炼四百—五百炉钢后的定炉时间由过去的三至七昼夜缩短到二至六昼夜，从而加速了钢的生产，并从每平方米炉底面积出产了九点二二吨钢，超过了包括美国在内的一切西方国家的炼钢纪录。在西北地区重要钢铁工业中心切列波维茨钢铁工厂，以共产党员雅申科、安东诺夫等人为首的工作队由于采用了炉顶高压和高温鼓风等先进技术，今年头九个月内就超计划为国家炼出了一万六千六百吨生铁。在10月份，他们又进而创造了一个空前纪录，使高炉有效容积利用系数达到零点五四二，比去年全苏联平均纪录——零点七七一高出许多。
    不断扩大并迅速进行基本建设，使钢铁工业生产能力迅速增加，这是两年来特别是今年苏联钢铁工业取得重大成就的另一个重要原因。例如，从1959年到今年11月，苏联就建成了七座新高炉和更多的平炉和轧钢设备。单在今年一年内投入生产的设备，每年就可以生产四百八十万吨铁，四百三十万吨钢，五百万吨钢材。而大家知道，在大洋彼岸的美国，垄断资本暴露出它显然没有能力利用现有的生产力。目前，美国现有的钢铁工业生产能力被利用的还不到50％。
    据美国《纽约时报》评论员施瓦尔茨的统计，今年头三季度，苏联钢产量已月月缩短了同美国的差距，在第三季度，两国的钢产量已十分接近，分别为一千六百三十万吨和一千七百七十万吨。施瓦尔茨在分析了苏美两国钢铁工业第三季度的生产情况后不安地写道：“使美国专家耽忧的是……，苏联现在生产的钢差不多和美国一样多了”。
    据新华社13日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联国家计划委员会的一位专家费利波夫前不久在一次会议上宣称，现在，苏联的焦炭生产量已经超过了美国，炼焦炉生产过程的机械化水平也高于美国。由于苏联和其他社会主义国家焦炭产量的增长，今年社会主义阵营国家焦炭产量将占全世界焦炭总产量的40％。
    他说，在过去十年中，苏联焦炭工业的生产能力增加了一倍以上。为了满足钢铁工业和其他生产部门对焦炭不断增长的需要，到七年计划结束时的1965年，苏联还将建成五十三座新的炼焦炉，并改建许多现有的炼焦炉。（附图片）
