Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 11th. According to a military communique released today by the headquarters of the Algerian National Liberation Army, the Algerian National Liberation Army killed 167 French soldiers and wounded 263 others between November 26th and December 5th.

The communique stated that during this period, the Algerian National Liberation Army engaged the French army in twenty locations, launched twenty-two attacks on French military strongholds, and carried out eleven ambushes on French troops and military convoys. Algerian National Liberation Army commando units also launched forty-seven rapid attacks, and sabotage teams carried out military operations against French military installations throughout Algeria.

The communique pointed out that during this period, the Algerian National Liberation Army also destroyed twenty-nine French military vehicles, destroyed three French military trains with landmines, shot down several French military aircraft, and captured one hundred and fifty-five weapons. Twenty-four fully armed French soldiers surrendered to the Algerian National Liberation Army.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 10th. The Foreign Ministry of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria issued a communique here today revealing that the French colonial authorities heinously murdered three Algerian patriots on December 8th. Busetta and Abdelkader were beheaded in the Santé Prison in France, and Slimane was killed in Algiers.

The communique said: "This barbaric crime, disregarding international law, is a new and serious provocation to the Algerian people."

The communique pointed out that this new atrocity occurred on the eve of French President de Gaulle's trip to Algeria to deploy a new deceptive "referendum" plot. The communique said that this act proves that those seemingly enlightened statements by the French government on the Algerian issue are worthless.
