Ice seals ten thousand miles, only waiting for the thaw

    Winter is the busiest and most arduous season for the transportation department of Anshan Iron and Steel. At this time, more than 60% of the raw materials, fuel, and supplies transported to Anshan from all over the country are frozen solid, and no matter how hard you beat them with sticks and hammers, they are not easily broken open. This year, the workers of the transportation department of Anshan Iron and Steel learned from the experience and lessons of previous years and started the anti-freezing and thawing work for winter transportation as early as April and May. In just four or five months, they improved and created more than 9,000 anti-freezing and thawing tools of various types, and researched and summarized more than ten anti-freezing and thawing technologies, including powerful thawing vibrators, hammer picks, expanding wedges, steam furnaces, and thawing blasting methods. In addition, they also overhauled locomotives, trams, and various mechanical and electrical equipment.
    On November 21st, there was a strong wind and heavy snow, and the weather in Anshan became even colder. The largest storage yard of Anshan Iron and Steel—the Lingshan Ore Yard—has been receiving trains loaded with frozen and solid ore these days. The workers looked at the ice-covered frozen cars and said: We are not afraid of how solid you are frozen! As soon as the train arrived, the workers used the advanced technologies they had already researched, such as the blasting thawing method and the steam thawing method, as well as new anti-freezing and thawing tools such as hammer picks and expanding wedges. In previous years, it took at least eight hours for twelve people to unload a frozen car, but this time it only took four hours. A wind and snowstorm froze the concentrated ore powder at the Xibajiazi Storage Yard into ice mountains. The loading and unloading workers at this yard proposed "We are determined to make the severe cold bow its head and the ice and snow give way." They planted red flags on the site, lit steam thawing furnaces, and confidently modified the grab of the electric shovel into a shovel suitable for winter operations. Finally, they won the battle against the ice and snow! Since the beginning of winter, they have been overfulfilling the loading and unloading tasks every day.

    冬季是鞍钢运输部的最繁忙的季节，也是作业条件最艰苦的时期。这时从全国各地运抵鞍山的原料、燃料和材料，60％以上都要冻成一团，任凭你棒敲锤打，轻易也敲打不开。今年鞍钢运输部的职工接受往年的经验教训，早在4、5月份，就开始了冬季运输的防冻解冻工作。在短短的四、五个月中，就改进和创造各种防冻解冻工具九千多件，研究和总结出防冻和解冻技术十多项，包括效力强大的解冻震动器、锤头镐、涨起子、蒸汽炉和解冻爆破法等。此外还检修了机车、电车和各种机械、电气设备。
    11月21日大风大雪，鞍山的天气更冷了，鞍钢最大的贮料场——灵山矿石场，这几天到的全部是冻得又坚又实的矿石车。工人们眼望着冰串倒挂的冰冻车，说：冻得再坚实也不怕你！火车一来，工人们就用起早已研究好的爆破解冻法、蒸汽解冻法等先进技术，和锤头镐、涨起子等新式防冻解冻工具。往年十二个人卸一辆冻车起码要八个多小时，这次只用了四个小时。一场风雪，把西八家子贮料场的精矿粉冻成了一座座冰山。这个场的装卸工人提出“定叫严寒低头，冰雪让路”，在现场上插起一面面红旗，烧起一座座解冻蒸汽炉，并且胸有成竹地把电铲的抓子改成适于冬季作业的铲子，终于战得冰雪低了头！入冬以来，天天超额完成装车和卸车任务。
