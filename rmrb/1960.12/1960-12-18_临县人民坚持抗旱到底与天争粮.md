    Lin County People Persist in Fighting Drought to the End, Seizing Grain from the Heavens

    Hundred Days Without a Drop of Rain During Spring Sowing, and Also Suffering from Natural Disasters Such as Wind, Frost, Insects, and Hail

    Although the Autumn Harvest was Reduced, Living Arrangements were Implemented, and the Masses Actively Engaged in Production to Overcome the Disaster

    (This newspaper reports) The people of Lin County, Shanxi Province, under the strong leadership of the Party and the organization of the People's Communes, stood tall and fought against the drought, the worst in sixty years, and finally greatly reduced the severity of the disaster. Currently, the cadres and masses of the entire county, with the strong support of all sides, are united and full of confidence in vigorously engaging in production for disaster relief and practicing economy to overcome the famine, striving for a good harvest next year.

    This year, the drought demon in Lin County came with unusual ferocity. According to the memory of elderly people, Lin County suffered a severe drought in the twenty-sixth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu (i.e., 1900). The county gazetteer recorded the drought as follows: "Beggars from village to village, corpses everywhere on the roads. After winter, the bark of trees was stripped bare, grass roots were eaten clean, looting became prevalent, and thieves ran rampant, making small paths impassable, villages without smoke, fathers and sons not caring for each other, husbands and wives each going their separate ways, children abandoned, crawling in the streets crying to death..." However, the drought of the twenty-sixth year of Guangxu was much smaller compared to this year. In the twenty-sixth year of Guangxu, there were droughts in spring and summer, but there was sufficient rain in autumn, and the small-day millet crops grew very well. This year, there was no full rain throughout the year, especially during the spring sowing period when there was not a drop of rain for one hundred days. In addition to the drought, disasters such as wind, frost, insects, and hail also occurred from time to time. At the moment of fighting drought and rushing to plant, a "May snow" froze 120,000 mu of wheat to death, and many areas did not even harvest the wheat seeds. The two wind disasters occurred on July 10th and September 12th, especially the latter, which blew so dark that the sky and the earth were dark. In the Guangke Huzhai commune alone, more than 400 trees were uprooted. In many places, crops were blown to the ground, with the most serious cases reaching 90%. In the face of such a serious disaster, the people of Lin County did not flinch, but stood tall and fought against it.

    As early as early spring, the Lin County Party Committee, based on the weather station's drought forecast, called on the masses to "plant early fields and plant drought-resistant fields" and seized the moisture to rush to plant. By April, when it was the most suitable time for sowing, the drought became more and more serious day by day, and sowing became more and more difficult. At this time, the county party committee put forward the call to "plant wherever there is a gap, rush to plant in time, and protect the seedlings even if it doesn't rain." Thus, a massive anti-drought struggle unfolded. However, the topsoil was very poor, and it was impossible to plant. Even if planted, the seedlings could not emerge. The task was arduous, but the people of Lin County were strong, and they finally came up with a set of anti-drought planting methods: Initially, the dry planting and compression method was used, that is, after sowing in the field, more foot treading or rolling with stone rollers was added to compress. This way, the soil layers were tightly connected, and after the morning and evening tides, seedlings could still emerge. Hundreds of thousands of mu of millet and sorghum in the county were mostly caught in this way. Subsequently, the drought became more and more serious, and this kind of planting was no longer effective. They adopted the method of "borrowing moisture to plant," that is, digging open the pits, digging out the dry soil, finding wet soil from elsewhere and putting it in, then sowing and burying, and in this way, more than 300,000 mu were sown. Until no more wet soil could be dug from the ground, people began to carry water to plant seeds. At this time, the county party committee issued the call for "ten thousand waters to return to the fields," and thus a movement to find water sources, open canals, and dig springs was launched among the masses. "Since ancient times, water flows to low places, but we insist on calling it uphill!" "Even if the sky is dry and the ground is dry, our hearts are not dry, dig springs and carry water to fight difficulties!" These loud battle slogans greatly encouraged the people's confidence in the struggle, and finally, in the face of severe spring drought, they successfully completed the planting task.

    The planting stage was conquered. After entering summer, the drought demon intensified. As soon as the crops were exposed to the sun at noon, their leaves curled up, and they did not release all day long, curling tighter and tighter until they withered. Although people were still watering, the land area was large, and they could not take care of it. More than 200,000 mu of seedlings were burned to death; it was even harder to calculate the number of mu with missing seedlings and broken ridges. At this time, some people developed a sense of disappointment, saying, "It's no use watering with oil if it doesn't rain!" However, in every critical moment, the Party always pointed out the direction in a timely manner. While encouraging everyone to increase their confidence, the county party committee put forward the battle slogan of "compensating for the loss of the autumn harvest with the small autumn harvest," mobilizing the masses to plant small autumn crops. The Party's policy was deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. At this time, more than 10,000 strong laborers returned to the countryside, and more than 2,000 cadres went down to work with the masses, sharing weal and woe, which further encouraged the people's enthusiasm. Everyone said: "We won't do it halfway, we'll fight the drought until the sky bows its head!" Thus, people replanted and replanted. When the late autumn crops could no longer be replanted, the county party committee called for: combining with cultivating and weeding to plant vegetables. This filled the more than 200,000 mu of autumn grain land that had been burned to death and all the land with missing seedlings and broken ridges with vegetables.

    After such tenacious struggles by the people of the entire county, the seedlings on the county's 1.58 million mu of land were basically preserved. However, they grew very strangely. Each piece of land contained several crops, some even as many as eight or nine: millet, sorghum, mountain yam, black beans, buckwheat, turnips..., everything that should be there. Because the crops were seven high and eight low, people called it "five generations under one roof" or "six-story building." Although these crops had very messy heads and the harvest was not as large as that of the autumn crops, with a reduction in production of about 100 million jin compared to last year (average yield per mu was only 40 jin), the total output was still nearly twice as much as in the twenty-sixth year of Guangxu. People proudly said: We have won the victory over the disaster. After the autumn harvest, in order to make up for the loss of crop production, the county party committee put forward the battle slogan of "compensating for the loss of domestic produce with wild produce," and a movement of large-scale collection was launched throughout the county, and many wild animals and wild birds were hunted.

    In this disaster year, in order to ensure that the masses live well and ensure that production is good, the 27 members of the Lin County Party Committee, headed by the first secretary, went deep into the front lines, and at the same time, more than 2,400 cadres went down to meticulously arrange the production of the masses and lead the masses to carry out the production disaster relief movement. In November, the county party committee sent another batch of cadres to strengthen the leadership of the three types of management areas. Now, the entire county's people have arranged fuel for the winter, and food rations have been implemented, and each person can still have one or two jin of vegetables every day. Because the living arrangements are good, the masses are full of enthusiasm, actively engage in winter production, vigorously engage in sideline occupations, and strive to increase income.

    The people of Lin County have been able to overcome the disaster, in addition to their own efforts to become strong and work hard, there is another important reason, that is, the support and encouragement of the entire Party and the entire people. The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China has been very concerned about Lin County's disaster relief struggle. Comrade Tao Lujia, the first secretary of the provincial party committee, has given specific instructions to the Lin County Party Committee on production disaster relief and economical famine relief work. After the autumn harvest, the people of Jin Southeast District, Taiyuan, Jinzhong and other places also transferred a large number of materials to support the people of Lin County.

### 临县人民坚持抗旱到底与天争粮

    有党坚强领导　有公社巨大力量　有各方面支援
    临县人民坚持抗旱到底与天争粮
    春播期间百日无滴雨，又遭受风冻虫雹等自然灾害
    秋收虽然减产，生活安排落实，群众积极生产救灾
    本报讯　山西临县人民在党的坚强领导和人民公社的组织下，挺起胸膛与六十年不遇的旱灾斗争，终于大大缩小了灾情。目前，全县干部和群众，在各方面的有力支援下，正团结一致，满怀信心地大搞生产救灾，节约度荒，争取明年有个好收成。
    今年临县的旱魔来势异常凶猛。据年老的人记忆，光绪二十六年（即1900年）临县曾经遭受过严重的旱灾。对这次旱灾县志上作了如下记载：“村村乞丐沿门，道路死尸遍地。入冬后，树皮剥尽，草根吃光，刁抢流行，盗贼四起，弄得小道无人行，村落断烟火，父子不相顾，夫妻各西东，孩子无人收留，爬行于街头号哭而死……。”可是光绪二十六年的旱灾与今年比较起来，却要小得多。光绪二十六年是春夏两旱，秋来雨足，小日月庄稼长得很好。今年是全年无饱雨，特别在春播期间滴雨不下有一百天。除旱灾以外，风、冻、虫、雹等灾害也不时发生。正在抗旱抢种的时刻，一场“五月雪”，冻死了十二万亩麦子，许多地区连麦种也没有收回来。两次风灾是7月10日和9月12日，特别是后一次，刮得天昏地暗，光克虎寨一个公社，就连根拔倒树木四百余株。许多地方的庄稼，也被刮得遍地倒伏，最严重的倒伏到90％。在这样严重的灾害面前，临县的人民毫不畏缩，而是挺起胸膛，与之战斗。
    早在初春，中共临县县委就根据气象台的旱象预报，号召群众“种早田、种秷田”，乘墒抢种。到4月间，正当播种最适时的时候，旱象就一日比一日严重，播种越来越困难。这时，县委又提出“见缝插针，适时抢种，天不下雨保全苗”的号召。于是一场声势浩大的抗旱斗争展开了。可是，墒土很赖，怎么也种不上；种上了，又出不了苗。任务是艰巨的，然而临县人民是坚强的，他们终于想出了一套抗旱种植的办法：起初是用干种镇压法，就是在地里下种后，多加脚踩或辘砘镇压。这样土层紧连，经过早晚潮润，仍可出苗。全县的数十万亩糜谷、高粱，大都是这样捉苗的。随后，旱象愈来愈严重，这样播种也不济事了。他们就采取了“借墒种”的办法，即掏开圪凹，把干土挖出，又从别处找出湿土放进去，然后下籽掩埋，如此又下种了三十余万亩。直到地里再挖不见湿土，人们又开始了担水点种。这时，县委发出了“万水归田”的号召，于是在群众中开展了找水源、开水渠、挖泉水运动。“自古水往低处流，咱偏叫它上山头！”“天旱地旱心不旱，挖泉担水战困难！”这些响亮的战斗口号极大地鼓舞了人民的斗争信心，终于在严重春旱面前胜利完成了播种任务。
    播种一关被攻克了。入夏以后，旱魔变本加厉。庄稼一到中午就被晒得卷叶，整天不放，愈卷愈紧，直到枯干。尽管人们还在浇灌，但土地面积大，照顾不过来，被晒死的禾苗达二十余万亩之多；晒得缺苗断垅的更难计算。这时，有人产生了失望的情绪，说什么“天不下雨浇上油也不行！”然而，每到紧急关头，党总是及时地指出方向。县委一面鼓励大家提高信心，一面提出“大秋丢了小秋补”的战斗口号，发动群众大种小秋作物。党的政策深入人心，此时又有万余精壮劳力回到农村，两千多名干部下放与群众同甘共苦，更加鼓舞了人民的干劲，大家说：“一不做，二不休，抗旱抗到天低头！”于是，人们补了再补，种了再种。当晚秋作物再不能补种的时候，县委又号召：结合中耕锄草大种蔬菜。这就把晒死的二十余万亩秋禾地和一切缺苗断垅的地都补种上了菜。
    经过全县人民这样顽强奋战，全县一百五十八万亩土地，基本上都保全了苗。不过它成长得很奇特，每块地里都是几种作物，有的甚至多到八九种：糜、谷、高粱、山药、黑豆、荞麦、蔓菁……，应有尽有。因为作物七高八低，人们把它叫作“五世同堂”或“六层楼”。这些作物，虽然头穗很乱，收成不如大秋作物大，比去年减产约一亿斤（每亩平均产量仅四十斤），但总产量仍比光绪二十六年多收近两倍。人们自豪地说：我们赢得了抗灾的胜利。秋后，县委为了弥补作物减产的损失，又提出“家生丢了野生补”的战斗口号，全县掀起了大采大集的运动，并猎获了许多野兽、野禽。
    受灾年为使群众生活好，保证生产好，中共临县县委以第一书记为首的二十七名委员，都分别深入第一线，同时下放两千四百多名干部，深入细致地安排群众生产，领导群众开展生产救灾运动。11月份，县委又派出一批干部，加强三类管理区的领导。现在，全县人民过冬燃料已有了安排，口粮已经落实，每人每天还可以有一、二斤蔬菜。由于生活安排得好，群众干劲十足，积极进行冬季生产，大搞副业，力争增加收入。
    临县人民能够战胜灾荒，除自己发愤图强、艰苦奋斗外，还有一条重要原因，就是全党全民的支援和鼓舞。中共山西省委对临县的抗灾斗争关怀备至，省委第一书记陶鲁笳同志曾具体对临县县委的生产救灾、节约度荒工作作过指示。秋收以后，晋东南专区、太原、晋中等地人民还调运大批物资支援临县人民。
