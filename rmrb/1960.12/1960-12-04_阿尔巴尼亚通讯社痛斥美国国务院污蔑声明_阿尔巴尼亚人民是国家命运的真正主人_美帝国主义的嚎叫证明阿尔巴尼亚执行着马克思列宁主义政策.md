Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, December 2nd: The Albanian News Agency issued a statement on December 1st, refuting the recent statement by the U.S. State Department attacking and slandering Albania on the occasion of the forty-eighth anniversary of Albanian independence (November 28th) and the sixteenth anniversary of liberation (November 29th).

The statement said that the U.S. State Department's statement is not only a shameless and intolerable interference in the internal affairs of an independent country, undermining the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter, but also an integral part of the aggressive policy of hostility towards the Albanian people and opposition to peace consistently pursued by the U.S. government. The Albanian people despise and resolutely oppose this new hostile action by the U.S. government.

The statement said that the Albanian people are united more closely than ever around the Labor Party and the government, celebrating the forty-eighth anniversary of Albanian independence and the sixteenth anniversary of the liberation of the motherland from the hands of the Nazi fascists and traitors with great achievements in all aspects and an unprecedented upsurge of creative labor to welcome the Fourth Party Congress. Our heroic people and Albanian patriots abroad, as well as our many friends in the world, especially the fraternal people of socialist countries, are happy about the achievements we have made in all aspects. On the other hand, the enemies of Albania and the people's regime have gone mad because of our achievements and continue their despicable attacks and slanders. Just as we are celebrating our great national festival, this year the U.S. government, through the State Department, has issued another provocative and bribing statement, daydreaming of Albania's re-"independence" and fantasizing that our country will return to the "period" under feudal-capital and imperialist enslavement. Imperialist gentlemen, don't forget: True freedom and independence are not given to the Albanian people by anyone, but are achieved by their own heroic national liberation struggle and the greatest sacrifices against the Nazi fascist rulers and traitors; the Albanian people smashed the system of oppression and exploitation with weapons and established their own people's regime. They have forever become the true masters of the country and their destiny, and have opened the road to socialism and communism, turning Albania into a free and independent country, a strong socialist country, a loyal member of the great socialist camp led by the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, and an indestructible bastion of peace and progress on the Adriatic coast. Today, no force, threat, or provocation in the world can deviate the Albanian people from this glorious path, nor can it hinder the progress of history.

The statement emphasized that under the wise and courageous leadership of their party and government, the Albanian people have defended and consolidated their historic victory, defended and consolidated the independence of the motherland and the people's regime for sixteen years, and achieved the achievements of socialist construction through fierce and unyielding struggle against U.S. imperialism and its various lackeys. They have always and will always smash all conspiracies, tricks, provocations, and aggressive activities. Just as the Party and Comrade Hoxha taught, the Albanian people have never and will never have any illusions about the nature and true intentions of imperialism. They clearly know that as long as imperialism exists, there is soil for plunder and aggressive wars. U.S. imperialism is the most barbaric enemy of the peace and freedom of all peoples. Its ultimate goal is to eliminate socialism and establish its bloody hegemony over the people of all countries. Therefore, the Albanian people, the Labor Party, and the government will always maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance and combat readiness, so that the enemy will never find an opportunity for a sudden attack, and will always vigorously expose the aggressive policies and malicious conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and its despicable tools—modern revisionists. The united struggle of the people of all countries will accelerate the death of imperialism and the victory of socialism throughout the world.

The statement emphasized that the Albanian people do not expect U.S. imperialism—the deadly enemy of our country and socialism—to have any praise or kind words for us. Therefore, this new attack by the U.S. State Department is only another proof: the existence and prosperity of the People's Republic of Albania is a heavy blow to imperialism; it only proves that the Labor Party and the Albanian government vigorously condemn U.S. imperialism and its aggressive policies as the main danger to world peace, and that their unwavering principle of Marxism-Leninism in resolutely fighting to smash their conspiracies and offensives and defend world peace is so correct. The Albanian people are closely united around the Labor Party and the People's Government, raising revolutionary vigilance, and are always ready to smash every hostile attempt from any direction.

### 阿尔巴尼亚通讯社痛斥美国国务院污蔑声明  阿尔巴尼亚人民是国家命运的真正主人  美帝国主义的嚎叫证明阿尔巴尼亚执行着马克思列宁主义政策

    阿尔巴尼亚通讯社痛斥美国国务院污蔑声明
    阿尔巴尼亚人民是国家命运的真正主人
    美帝国主义的嚎叫证明阿尔巴尼亚执行着马克思列宁主义政策
    新华社地拉那2日电　阿尔巴尼亚通讯社在1日发表声明，驳斥美国国务院最近就阿尔巴尼亚独立四十八周年（11月28日）和解放十六周年（11月29日）发表的攻击和污蔑阿尔巴尼亚的声明。
    声明说，美国国务院的声明不仅是对一个独立国家内政的无耻和不可容忍的干涉，破坏联合国宪章的基本原则，同时也是美国政府所一贯奉行的敌视阿尔巴尼亚人民和反对和平的侵略政策的一个组成部分。阿尔巴尼亚人民鄙视和坚决反对美国政府这一新的敌对行动。
    声明说，阿尔巴尼亚人民空前紧密地团结在劳动党和政府的周围，以各方面的伟大成就和为迎接第四次党代表大会而掀起的空前的创造性劳动热潮来欢庆阿尔巴尼亚独立四十八周年和祖国从纳粹法西斯和卖国贼的手中获得解放十六周年。我们英雄的人民和国外的阿尔巴尼亚爱国者，以及我们在世界上的很多朋友，首先是社会主义国家的兄弟人民，都为我们在各个方面所取得的成就感到高兴。另一方面，阿尔巴尼亚和人民政权的敌人却由于我们的成就而疯狂起来，并继续着他们的卑鄙攻击和污蔑。就在庆祝我们伟大的民族节日的时候，今年美国政府竟通过国务院又发表了一个挑衅和贿赂性的声明，白日做梦地妄想阿尔巴尼亚再次
  “独立”，妄想我国重新回到封建——资本和帝国主义奴役下的“时期”。帝国主义先生们别忘了：真正的自由和独立并不是什么人施舍给阿尔巴尼亚人民的，而是他们以自己英勇的民族解放斗争和反对纳粹法西斯统治者及卖国贼的最大牺牲而取得的；阿尔巴尼亚人民以武器粉碎了压迫和剥削制度，并建立了自己的人民政权。他们永远成了国家和他们命运的真正主人，并打开了走向社会主义和共产主义的道路，把阿尔巴尼亚变成了一个自由和独立的国家，变成了一个强大的社会主义国家、以苏联为首的伟大的社会主义阵营和华沙条约的忠诚的一员，成了亚得里亚海滨的和平和进步的坚不可摧的堡垒。今天，世界上没有任何力量、威胁或者挑衅能使阿尔巴尼亚人民脱离这条光荣的道路，能阻碍历史的前进。
    声明强调说，阿尔巴尼亚人民在他们的党和政府的英明和勇敢的领导下，十六年来保卫和巩固了他们历史性的胜利，保卫和巩固了祖国的独立和人民政权，并以激烈的和不屈不挠的反对美帝国主义及其形形色色的仆从的斗争，取得了社会主义建设的成就。他们过去和将来都始终粉碎一切阴谋诡计、挑衅和侵略活动。就像党和霍查同志所教导的那样，阿尔巴尼亚人民过去和将来对帝国主义的本性和真正的企图都永远不会抱有幻想。他们清楚地知道，只要帝国主义还存在，就存在着掠夺和侵略战争的土壤。美帝国主义是各国人民和平和自由的最野蛮的敌人。它的最终目的是消灭社会主义和建立它对世界各国人民的血腥霸权。因此，阿尔巴尼亚人民、劳动党和政府将永远保持高度的革命警惕性和战斗准备，使敌人永远也找不到突然袭击的机会，并将始终大力揭露美帝国主义及其卑鄙的工具——现代修正主义者的侵略政策和恶毒阴谋。各国人民的联合斗争将加速帝国主义的死亡和社会主义在全世界的胜利。
    声明着重说，阿尔巴尼亚人民并不期望美帝国主义——我国和社会主义的死敌能对我们有什么赞颂和好话，因此，美国国务院的这一新的攻击只是再一次地证明：阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的存在和繁荣对帝国主义是一个多么沉重的打击；只是证明：劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚政府大力谴责美帝国主义及其侵略政策是世界和平的主要危险，为粉碎它们的阴谋和进攻、保卫世界和平而坚决斗争的马克思列宁主义的毫不动摇的原则政策是多么正确。阿尔巴尼亚人民紧密地团结在劳动党和人民政府的周围，提高革命警惕性，并随时准备粉碎来自任何方面的每一个敌对企图。
