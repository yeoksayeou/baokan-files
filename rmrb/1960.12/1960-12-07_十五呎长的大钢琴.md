    Fifteen-Foot Long Grand Piano
    Beautiful piano music wafts from the light industrial products exhibition hall of the Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Building. It turns out that a performer from the Shanghai Conservatory of Music is sitting in front of a domestically produced grand piano, giving it a trial run.

    This grand piano is fifteen feet long in total, and is a new product trial-produced by the Shanghai Musical Instrument Factory after the successful trial production of five-foot, seven-foot, and nine-foot grand pianos. This grand piano is mainly used for large-scale musical concerts. Its tone is soft and beautiful, and the keys are very flexible, able to move up and down six times in one second, capable of playing any complex musical work.

    十五呎长的大钢琴
    上海中苏友好大厦的轻工业品展览馆里，传出优美的钢琴声。原来，上海音乐院的一个演奏家正坐在一架国产大钢琴前面作试验性弹奏。
    这架大钢琴共有十五呎长，是上海乐器厂在五呎、七呎、九呎三角钢琴试制成功以后，又新试制的一种产品。这架大钢琴主要是用于大型的音乐演奏会。它的音色柔美，琴键非常灵活，在一秒钟之内，可以上下跳动六次，能够演奏任何复杂的音乐作品。
