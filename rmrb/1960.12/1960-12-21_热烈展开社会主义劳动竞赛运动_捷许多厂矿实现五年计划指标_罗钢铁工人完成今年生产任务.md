Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 19th: According to reports in the local newspapers, a stream of good news has recently arrived from Czechoslovakian factories and mines, announcing the early fulfillment of targets for the Second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960).

　　Coal miners are at the forefront of early plan fulfillment. The Sokolov brown coal mining area in North Bohemia became the first coal area in the country to complete the Second Five-Year Plan on November 19th. The miners in this area have pledged to overproduce 1.7 million tons of coal by the end of this year. In the machinery manufacturing industry, the Pisek Machinery Factory in Slovakia completed the total output value target stipulated by the Second Five-Year Plan in mid-October. Before the end of this year, it will overproduce 36 million crowns (Czech currency) worth of products.

　　In the metallurgical industry, the Sverma Steel Plant, one of the important metallurgical enterprises in Slovakia, completed the Second Five-Year Plan target one month ahead of schedule. This is the first enterprise in the metallurgical industry to complete the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

　　The Stalin Chemical Plant announced on December 9th that the plant had completed the Second Five-Year Plan not only in terms of total output value, but also in terms of cost and labor productivity. Before the end of this year, the factory will overproduce 123 million crowns worth of products.

　　The Gustav Kliment Shoe Factory in South Moravia completed the Second Five-Year Plan in early December and will overproduce 780,000 pairs of leather shoes before the end of the year.

　　Widespread socialist competition and the adoption of the latest technologies are a strong guarantee for early plan fulfillment. For example, in the Kladno hard coal mining area, which completed its Second Five-Year Plan coal output on November 25th, 70% of the workers (790 labor teams) participated in socialist competition. In the largest brown coal mining area in Czechoslovakia, located in North Bohemia, which completed its plan on November 20th, 587 teams participated in the competition for the title of "Socialist Labor Team," and 64 teams have already won this title. Two-thirds of the workers at the Pisek Machinery Factory participated in the movement to adopt the latest technologies.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 19th: According to reports in the local newspapers, Romanian steel workers have completed this year's plan to produce 1.7 million tons of steel and 950,000 tons of pig iron sixteen and twenty days ahead of schedule, respectively.

　　Romania's steel industry originally planned to increase steel production by 22% and pig iron by more than 11% this year compared with 1959. It is estimated that by the end of the year, steel production will increase by more than 26% over last year, and pig iron will increase by about 20%. In other words, this year will produce 370,000 tons more steel and more than 170,000 tons more pig iron than last year. These two absolute increases are more than the total annual output of steel and pig iron in 1938.

　　So far, several major steel enterprises across the country have completed this year's total output value plan ahead of schedule. The largest Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine in the country and the Resita Metallurgical Combine, which has a history of more than two hundred years, completed the annual total output value plan fifteen and twenty days ahead of schedule, respectively. These two companies have saved the country more than 37 million lei (Romanian currency) by saving raw materials and other methods.

　　From the beginning of this year, steel workers have launched a heated socialist labor emulation drive, determined to overfulfill this year's production plan with soaring labor enthusiasm. In the competition, they actively put forward innovation suggestions, promoted advanced working methods, helped each other and exchanged experiences, so the technical level and equipment utilization rate have been continuously improved. The Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine has adopted 275 innovation suggestions since the beginning of this year. These innovation suggestions not only promoted production, but also reduced product costs. In the first nine months of this year, the national average output of open-hearth furnaces per square meter of furnace bottom area per day was 300 kilograms more steel than planned, and the cost per ton of steel averaged 80 lei lower than last year. The blast furnace utilization coefficient of the "Victory" factory increased by 37% compared with last year. The No. 1 open-hearth furnace of the Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine has shortened the time for smelting each furnace of steel by one hour compared with last year, and has smelted more than 1,000 furnaces of fast steel since the beginning of this year.

　　The active production of Romanian iron ore miners and coal miners, as well as the mass movement to pick up scrap iron, have also played a significant role in the rapid growth of steel production this year. In the first three quarters of this year, iron ore miners over-mined 52,000 tons of iron sand, and workers in the Jiu coal area over-mined 50,000 tons of coal by the end of November. This year, millions of teenagers in urban and rural areas participated in the scrap iron collection movement. Youths in Bucharest alone collected more than 30,000 tons of scrap metal by the beginning of October.

　　Romanian steel workers are currently engaged in intense labor to complete and overfulfill all production targets for this year. It is estimated that this year's production of steel and metallurgical coke will increase by more than 42% and 34% respectively compared with 1959. The workers in the 800 mm and 650 mm rolling mills of the Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine have completed this year's production plan ahead of schedule and have reached the equipment utilization target for next year.

    热烈展开社会主义劳动竞赛运动
    捷许多厂矿实现五年计划指标
    罗钢铁工人完成今年生产任务
    据新华社布拉格19日电　据这里的报纸报道：近来，捷克斯洛伐克各工矿企业提前完成第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）指标的捷报纷纷传来。
    煤矿工人走在提前完成计划的前列。北波希米亚的索科洛夫褐煤矿区在11月19日成为全国首先完成第二个五年计划的煤区。这个煤区的矿工们已经提出保证，到今年年底要超计划多生产一百七十万吨煤。在机器制造工业方面，斯洛伐克的皮索克机械工厂在10月中旬就完成了第二个五年计划所规定的总产值指标，到今年年底前，将超计划生产三千六百万克朗（捷币）的产品。
    在冶金工业中，斯洛伐克地区的重要冶金企业之一斯维尔马炼钢厂已经提前一个月完成了第二个五年计划的指标，这是冶金工业中第一个提前完成第二个五年计划的企业。
    斯大林化学工厂在12月9日宣布，这个厂不仅在总产值方面，而且在成本、劳动生产率等方面也完成了第二个五年计划。到今年年底以前，这个工厂将超额生产一亿二千三百万克朗的产品。
    南摩拉维亚州的古斯塔夫·克利门特皮鞋厂在12月初完成了第二个五年计划，于年底前将超额生产七十八万双皮鞋。
    广泛开展社会主义竞赛和采用最新技术运动是提前完成计划的有力保证。例如，在11月25日完成第二个五年计划煤产量的克拉德诺硬煤矿区，有70％的工人（七百九十个劳动队）参加社会主义竞赛。在11月20日完成计划的位于北波希米亚的捷克斯洛伐克最大的褐煤矿区，有五百八十七个队参加了争取
  “社会主义劳动队”称号的竞赛运动，有六十四个队已获得这个称号。皮索克机械工厂有三分之二的工人参加了采用最新技术的运动。
    新华社布加勒斯特19日电　据这里的报纸报道：罗马尼亚钢铁工人已经提前十六天和二十天分别完成了今年生产一百七十万吨钢和九十五万吨生铁的计划。
    罗马尼亚钢铁工业今年原计划比1959年增产22％的钢和11％以上的生铁，而预计到年底，钢产量将比去年增长26％以上，生铁约增长20％，也就是说，今年将比去年多生产三十七万吨钢和十七万多吨生铁，这两个绝对增长量都比1938年全年钢和生铁的产量还要多。
    到目前为止，全国几个主要钢铁企业都提前完成了今年的总产值计划，全国最大的洪尼多阿拉冶金联合企业和有着两百多年历史的累希察冶金联合企业分别提前十五天和二十天完成了全年的总产值计划。这两个企业通过节约原材料等方法已为国家节约了三千七百多万列伊（罗币）。
    从今年一开始，钢铁工人就展开了热烈的社会主义劳动竞赛运动，以高涨的劳动热情决心超额完成今年的生产计划。在竞赛运动中，他们积极提出革新建议，推广先进工作方法，相互帮助和交流经验，因此技术水平和设备利用率都不断提高。洪尼多阿拉冶金联合企业今年以来已经采用了二百七十五项革新建议。这些革新建议不但促进了生产，而且还降低了产品成本。在今年头九个月中，全国平炉每天每平方米炉底面积的平均产量比计划多生产三百公斤钢，而每吨钢的成本平均比去年降低了八十列伊。“胜利”工厂的高炉利用系数比去年提高了37％。洪尼多阿拉冶金联合企业的一号平炉今年炼每炉钢的时间比去年缩短了一小时，今年以来已经炼了一千多炉快速钢。
    罗马尼亚铁矿工人、煤矿工人的积极生产和群众性的拣废铁运动对今年钢铁生产的快速增长也起了很大作用。铁矿工人在今年头三季度中超计划开采了五万二千吨铁砂，纪乌煤区的工人到11月底超计划开采了五万吨煤，今年城乡各地，有上百万的青少年参加了拣废铁运动，单是布加勒斯特的青年到10月上旬止就拣了三万多吨废金属。
    罗马尼亚钢铁工人目前正在为完成和超额完成今年的全部生产指标进行着紧张的劳动。预计，今年钢材和冶金用焦的产量将比1959年分别增长42％和34％以上。洪尼多阿拉冶金联合企业的八百毫米和六百五十毫米轧钢车间的工人都已提前完成了今年的生产计划，并达到了明年的设备利用指标。
