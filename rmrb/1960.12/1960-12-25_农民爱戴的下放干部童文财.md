After the people's commune was established in 1958, Communist Party member 童文财 (Tóng Wéncái) was sent to the Luli (炉里) Agricultural Brigade of the Second Branch of the Da Mao Shan (大茅山) Reclamation Farm to serve as the Secretary of the Party General Branch. From the day he arrived in this brigade, whether in the dead of winter or the sweltering summer, he worked and labored alongside the commune members. He understood the problems in the fields and the thoughts of the commune members. Last summer, when weeding the rice, he noticed that many late-season rice seedlings were yellow and weak, and that not enough base fertilizer had been applied to the fields, and some had not been top-dressed after weeding. After learning about it, he found out that the people in the mountainous areas had always considered "late rice as grass" and were unwilling to apply fertilizer to it. At that time, 童文财 did the math with the commune members: In the past, when late rice was not fertilized, one mu (亩) only yielded 100-200 jin (斤). If fertilizer was applied in a timely manner, each mu could yield an extra hundred or so jin, and the entire brigade could yield an extra 20,000-30,000 jin. The commune members felt that this made sense, so they all got motivated and went up the mountain with him to cut grass and burn it into ash to apply grass and ash fertilizer to the late rice. As a result, the seedlings soon grew strong and green. The yield of late rice this year doubled compared to the previous two years. The commune members said, "Ever since Secretary Tong came down to our brigade, late rice has become a treasure, no longer just grass!"

Later, 童文财 also discovered that the "density" aspect of the "Eight-Character Charter" was a weak link in the Luli Brigade. Rice had been planted here for years at a distance of one foot two inches, which not only resulted in low yields but also wasted a lot of land. After investigation and analysis, 童文财 proposed the idea of eight-inch close planting to the Luli Brigade and asked everyone to study it. Initially, some commune members disagreed, believing that this was cold and infertile paddy field, and the low temperature would affect yields if planted too densely. 童文财 then organized the cadres to plant experimental plots. As a result, the eight-inch close-planted field yielded 520 jin, while the one-foot-two-inch field yielded 380 jin. Through this fact, the commune members clearly saw the benefits of close planting. Once the commune members’ thinking was aligned, the entire brigade switched to eight-inch close planting for all the rice in 1959, resulting in increased production.

With the production of the Luli Production Brigade catching up, 童文财 then took the initiative to request to settle in the poorest Shuangxi (双溪) Brigade.

The Shuangxi Brigade is a backward team located under the Wufengling (乌风岭) of Da Mao Shan, with high mountains, cold water, thin soil, and lean fields. Half of the brigade's fields are cold and infertile paddy fields with white sandy soil, resulting in historically low yields. The state had to supply 100,000 jin of grain to this brigade every year. Some commune members believed that "sandy land is like a board, it's futile to work to death," and some were uneasy about agricultural production and wanted to become forestry workers. After arriving in Shuangxi, 童文财 lived, ate, and worked with the commune members. He learned that the masses were eager to shed the "backward" label and also understood their concerns. He tried every means to publicize the Party's policy of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production to the commune members, encouraging them to work hard, eradicate poverty, and thoroughly transform low-yield fields. While publicizing, 童文财 led the commune members to cut grass on the mountains, burn it into ash, and launch a shock campaign to accumulate fertilizer. When the early rice was flowering and heading, it encountered a drought, so 童文财 and the commune members went down to the river to carry water and up the mountains to divert water. Under his leadership, the commune members all expressed their determination to work hard for a few years and shed the backward label. As a result, after only one year of arduous struggle, the average yield of early rice on 970 mu in Shuangxi Brigade this year was 414 jin per mu, and the total grain output for the year increased by more than 30% compared to last year. This year, they not only did not need the state to supply grain, but also sold 71,000 jin of surplus grain to the state.

    农民爱戴的下放干部童文财
    共产党员童文财在1958年人民公社化以后，下放到大茅山垦殖场二分场的炉里农业大队去担任党总支书记。从他到这个队的那天起，不论是数九寒冬或是三伏炎夏，都跟社员们一起出工，一起劳动。田里有什么问题，社员们有什么想法，他都了解。去年夏天耘禾的时候，他看见许多一季晚稻禾苗长得又黄又瘦，田里底肥下得少，耘田以后有的还不追肥。经了解，原来是山区群众素来认为“晚稻是草”，不愿给晚稻追肥。童文财当时跟社员们算了笔账：往年晚稻不下肥，一亩只打一、二百斤，如果抓紧时机追肥，每亩就可以多收百把斤粮，全大队就可以多收二、三万斤。社员们听了，觉得很有道理，于是，都鼓起劲来，跟他一道上山铲草烧灰，给晚稻追施草肥和灰肥。这样，禾苗不久就长得青壮了。这年晚稻产量比前两年翻了一番，社员们说：“自从童书记下放到咱队里以后，晚禾变成宝，再也不是草了！”
    后来，童文财又发现炉里大队在贯彻“八字宪法”中，“密”字是一个薄弱环节。这里种稻历年都是一尺二寸的距离，不仅产量很低，而且浪费很多的田地。童文财经过调查分析后，向炉里大队提出八寸密植的建议，要大家研究。开始有一部分社员不同意，认为这里是冷浆田，气温低，密了会影响产量。童文财便组织干部种试验田。结果，八寸密植的田收了五百二十斤，一尺二寸的田收了三百八十斤。通过这件事实，社员们清楚地看到了密植的好处。社员们思想通了，1959年全大队把稻子全部改为八寸密植，得到了增产。
    炉里生产大队的生产赶上来了，这时，童文财又主动要求到最穷的双溪大队去落户。
    双溪大队是大茅山的乌风岭下一个山高水冷、土薄田瘦的落后队。全队有一半白沙土的冷浆田，历年产量很低。这个队每年要国家供应十万斤口粮。部分社员认为“沙田一块板，做死也枉然”，有的不安心农业生产，想去做林业工人。童文财到双溪以后，在和社员们同吃同住同劳动中，了解到群众都迫切要求摘掉“落后”帽子，也摸到了他们心里的顾虑，就想方设法利用各种机会向社员们宣传党的大办农业大办粮食的方针，鼓励社员发愤图强，挖掉穷根，彻底改造低产田。童文财一面宣传，一面率领社员们上山砍草烧灰，突击积肥。早稻扬花孕穗时碰到了干旱，童文财又跟社员们一道下河挑水，上山引水。社员们在他的带动下，大家都表示要苦干几年，摘掉落后帽子。结果只经过一年的艰苦奋斗，双溪大队今年九百七十亩早稻平均亩产四百一十四斤，全年粮食总产量比去年增长了30％以上。今年他们不但不要国家供应粮食，还卖给国家七万一千斤余粮。
