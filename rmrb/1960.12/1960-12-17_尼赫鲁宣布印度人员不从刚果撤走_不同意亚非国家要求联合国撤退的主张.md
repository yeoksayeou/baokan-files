Xinhua News Agency, December 15th—According to a report by the Indian Press Trust: Indian Prime Minister Nehru announced in the Indian People's Assembly on the 12th that India has currently decided not to withdraw its personnel from the Congo.

He also said that India's future attitude would depend on future developments there and on how Indian nationals are treated there.

Nehru also disagreed with the demand of many Asian and African countries that the United Nations withdraw from the Congo. He believes that if the United Nations withdraws from the Congo, it would be dangerous, because withdrawal would mean civil war in that country and interference by major powers. He also called on the United Nations Security Council, which is currently meeting, to grant the United Nations mission there "the necessary powers to function properly."

Nehru said that all Congolese "political prisoners," including Lumumba, should be released, and the Congolese parliament should be allowed to meet. He accused the Belgians of encouraging separatist tendencies in the Congo and of transporting large quantities of weapons into the Congo. He also expressed regret that various authorities and countries had fostered Mobutu's attitude of not allowing the Congolese parliament to meet.

As previously reported, due to dissatisfaction with the United Nations' actions in the Congo, the governments of some countries, such as the United Arab Republic, Guinea, Morocco, Ceylon, and Indonesia, have formally announced the withdrawal of their troops sent to the Congo under the command of the "United Nations Force" headquarters.

    尼赫鲁宣布印度人员不从刚果撤走
    不同意亚非国家要求联合国撤退的主张
    新华社15日讯　据印度报业托辣斯报道：印度总理尼赫鲁12日在印度人民院宣布，目前，印度已经决定不从刚果撤出它的人员。
    他又说，印度将来的态度将取决于那里将来的发展，并且取决于印度国民在那里所受的待遇如何。
    尼赫鲁还不同意许多亚非国家要求联合国撤出刚果的主张。他认为，联合国要是撤出刚果，那将是危险的，因为撤出就意味着那个国家会发生内战，各大国会进行干涉。他还要求现在举行会议的联合国安全理事会授予在那里的联合国代表团“适当发挥作用所必需的权力”。
    尼赫鲁说，刚果的一切“政治犯”包括卢蒙巴在内，都应当释放，应当允许刚果议会开会。他指责比利时人曾鼓励刚果的分裂主义倾向和把大量武器运入刚果。他还表示遗憾说，各个当局和国家曾助长蒙博托采取不让刚果议会开会的态度。
  前已报道，由于对联合国在刚果的所作所为不满，已有一些国家的政府，如阿联、几内亚、摩洛哥、锡兰、印度尼西亚等，正式宣布撤出它们派往刚果受“联合国军”司令部指挥的部队。
