Hebei Mobilizes Two Million Laborers to the Front Lines of Agricultural Production

Hebei Province is enthusiastically responding to the Party's call to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production. From July to November this year, it has transferred approximately two million laborers to reinforce the front lines of agricultural production.

The influx of a large number of new forces into the agricultural front has boosted the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members. The timely harvesting of over 70 million mu of grain crops throughout the province was more meticulous and thorough than in previous years. Simultaneously, the sowing of over 30 million mu of wheat was completed in a timely manner.

Currently, the downwardly delegated labor force and the original labor force on the agricultural front are actively engaged in winter production activities such as accumulating fertilizer, managing wheat fields, and developing diversified operations, in order to greet the new high tide of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production next year.

Sichuan Intensifies Winter Plowing and Water Storage

Various regions in Sichuan are actively carrying out early winter plowing and water storage work, making early preparations for spring irrigation next year. In Mianyang Prefecture alone, in just half a month, the vast majority of the more than two million mu of winter paddy fields in the region have been plowed twice, achieving level fields and fine mud. The prefecture has also built and repaired more than 23,000 river dikes, storing more than 100 million cubic meters of water. Jianyang County's people's communes have universally implemented a "five-fixed" management responsibility system—fixed personnel, fixed time, fixed area, fixed water storage volume, and fixed work points. The county's 37 reservoirs, more than 6,000 ponds, and 3,000 river dikes are basically full of water, with the total water storage volume increasing by more than 40% compared to the same period last year.

Jilin Actively Develops Winter Sideline Production

From the Changbai Mountains in the east of Jilin Province to the Baicheng Grassland in the west, winter sideline production activities such as hunting wild animals, catching fish and shrimp, collecting wild plants, weaving baskets and mats, boiling saltpeter, and raising poultry and livestock are being widely carried out. Commune members, undeterred by the severe cold and hardship, have harvested a large quantity of sideline products. Preliminary statistics up to December 20th show that sideline income throughout the province has reached more than 57.98 million yuan.

Jilin Province suffered relatively severe natural disasters in agricultural production this year. In accordance with the spirit of "compensating for agricultural losses with sideline income," various regions have universally strengthened their leadership over sideline production. Counties and cities have established sideline production command centers or diversified management offices; communes and management districts all have a secretary, head, or director specifically in charge of sideline production. Commercial departments are also stepping up procurement, supplying tools, and adjusting raw materials to support sideline production.

Fujian Mobilizes 100,000 Fishermen for Winter Fishing Season

More than 100,000 fishermen in various fishing grounds along the coast of Fujian are setting sail to sea, chasing after schools of fish, and investing in winter fishing production. Hundreds of fishing boats going north to the Zhangjiang fishing ground are seizing the moment, braving frequent strong winds, and catching more than four million jin of hairtail in three days. Hundreds of fishing boats gathered in the northeastern Fujian fishing ground have been catching large quantities of fish and shrimp for days. Fishermen from a large fishing production team in Lianjiang County caught more than 110,000 jin of krill in two days. The southeastern Fujian fishing ground is also vigorously hunting hairtail and great white sharks. (Attached picture)
