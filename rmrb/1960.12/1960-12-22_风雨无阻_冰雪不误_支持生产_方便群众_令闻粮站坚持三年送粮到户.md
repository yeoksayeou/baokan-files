    Regardless of Wind or Rain, Unfazed by Ice and Snow, Supporting Production, Serving the Masses
    Lingwen Grain Station Persists in Delivering Grain to Households for Three Years
    (Our Dispatch) According to news from the Shenyang Daily: All the staff of the Lingwen First Grain Supply Station of the Huigong People's Commune in Shenhe District, Shenyang City, have given convenience to the masses and kept the difficulties to themselves. For three years, they have consistently insisted on delivering grain to households, continuously improving the quality of service, and have been enthusiastically praised by men, women, old and young in the supply area.
    The Lingwen First Grain Supply Station is responsible for the grain supply of 1,023 households in the first management area of the Huigong Commune, excluding those dining in public canteens. For the past three years, residents here have never had to carry rice bags and oil bottles to the grain station to buy grain and oil themselves. Regardless of the scorching sun or biting cold wind, whether it is icy and snowy or rainy and muddy, the staff of the grain station have always steadfastly delivered the grain for thousands of households to their homes on time. Therefore, nearby residents have praised each other: "Insisting on delivering grain is number one, taking care of the elderly and weak with extra joy; every household is happy, worthy of flying the red flag every season." This grain station has won the honorary title of "Advanced Grain Station" in Shenhe District.
    The Lingwen First Grain Station supplies an average of over 140,000 jin of grain to residents every month. The grain station only has four employees. Such a large amount of grain
  (oil not included), has to be delivered cart by cart, and each cart of grain has to be packed into many different rice bags with different names. The task is indeed arduous, and it is not smooth sailing. The clarion call of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 awakened the broad masses of housewives, who actively got rid of housework and participated in social labor. This new situation brought new problems to the delivery of grain to homes. Grain station comrades found that almost eight out of ten homes were locked, and grain could not be delivered. What to do? Should the grain delivery method, which was once welcomed by the masses, be simply cancelled? Or should another way be found? Because all the staff of the grain station established the determination to serve the people, with the support of the Party, they finally persisted in the grain supply method of delivering grain to households. The staff thought: The number of couples working together has increased. If grain is not delivered, they will be busy with production during the day and will have to come to the grain station to buy grain at night, which will take up their rest and study time. How can we talk about supporting production and caring for life? After discussion, the direction of insisting on delivering grain was clarified, and they came up with a solution by relying on the masses: elderly people in the residential courtyard who did not work were elected as grain group leaders. When buying grain, employees whose couples were both at work would give the rice bags and money to the group leader in advance and entrust them to purchase on their behalf. The result of this trial brought great convenience to the staff and promoted mutual assistance and unity among neighbors. After undergoing this test, the grain supply method of delivering grain to households gave all the staff of Lingwen First Grain Station more confidence. They said: As long as it is beneficial to the masses and welcomed by the masses, even if the difficulties are great, we must persist.
    This year in August, due to flood disasters, traffic was briefly interrupted, which affected the transportation and processing of grain for a time. Therefore, the amount of grain supplied to the citizens at one time was only enough for a few days, and it was impossible to deliver every day. Should the old method before grain delivery be restored? Counter-based grain payment would be convenient for us, but it would trouble the masses. All the staff of the grain station thought of the Party's entrustment and the people's expectations. Therefore, even if it was only for a few days, we had to insist on delivering grain. So, they delivered during the day and at night. Finally, the grain for thousands of households was delivered to the residents' homes time and time again on time.
    The reason why the Lingwen First Grain Station has overcome numerous difficulties and persisted in delivering grain for three years is mainly because all the staff have realized the glory and importance of their responsibilities, understood the profound significance of grain supply work, and have a heart that considers the masses everywhere. The salesman Chen Xingdi, who delivers grain by cart, even in heavy rain, no matter how difficult the road is, covers the grain with tarpaulin and pushes the cart from house to house, delivering the grain to households on time. The fifty-seven-year-old salesman Cui Binghuan, who had lived in a grain depot in the old society and witnessed capitalists hoarding and speculating, is even more vigorous today when he sees that the broad masses of people are no longer struggling to get grain. He said: "As long as the masses feel convenient, we are willing to work hard!"

    风雨无阻　冰雪不误　支持生产　方便群众
    令闻粮站坚持三年送粮到户
    本报讯　据沈阳日报消息：沈阳市沈河区惠工人民公社令闻第一粮食供应站全体职工，把方便送给群众，把困难留给自己，三年来一贯坚持送粮到户，不断提高服务质量，受到供应区的男女老少热情称赞。
    令闻第一粮食供应站担负着惠工公社第一管理区在公共食堂就餐以外的一千零二十三户居民的口粮供应任务。三年来，这里的居民，从来不用提着米袋和油瓶亲自到粮站去买粮、打油，不论是烈日当头或是寒风刺骨，也不管是冰天雪地或是大雨泥泞，粮站的工作人员始终是坚持不渝地把千家万户的口粮准时地送到居民家里。因此，附近的居民争相称赞：“坚持送粮数第一，老弱照顾乐有余；家家户户人欢喜，不愧季季飘红旗”。这个粮站曾获得沈河区“先进粮站”的光荣称号。
    令闻第一粮站平均每月供应居民的口粮达十四万余斤，粮站的职工只有四名。这么大数字的粮食
  （油未算在内），要用手推车一车一车的送，而每一车粮又不知分别装进多少个不同姓名的米袋里，任务确实艰巨，作起来并不一帆风顺。1958年大跃进的号角，唤醒了广大家庭妇女，纷纷摆脱家务劳动参加了社会劳动。这一新情况给送粮到家带来了新问题，粮站同志走十家几乎有八家锁着门，不能送粮，怎么办？是干脆取消这一曾经受群众欢迎的送粮办法呢？还是另谋他路？由于粮站全体职工树立了为人民服务的决心，在党的支持下，终于把送粮到户的供应办法坚持下去。职工们想：夫妇一齐上班的增多了，如果不送粮，他们白天忙生产，只好夜晚来粮站买粮，占去了他们的休息和学习时间，这怎能谈到支持生产、关怀生活呢？经过讨论，坚持送粮这一方向明确了，他们依靠群众想出了办法：由居民院里推选不上班的老人担任粮食小组长，到买粮时，夫妇双方上班的职工就将米袋和钱等事前交到小组长家委托他来代购。这样试行的结果，给职工带来很大方便，并促进了邻里间的互助团结。送粮到户的供应方法，经受了这次考验后，给令闻第一粮站全体职工更添了信心，他们表示：只要对群众有利，受群众欢迎的事，既使困难再大，也要坚持下去。
    今年8月由于洪水成灾，交通短暂的中断，致使粮食的调运、加工一时受到影响。因此，对市民的口粮供应一次送量只是几天的，需要天天送还送不过来，难道恢复实行送粮以前的老办法吗？柜台付粮，那倒是自己方便，群众却麻烦了。粮站全体职工想到党的委托，想到人民的期待，因此，即使是几天，也要坚持送粮。于是，他们白天送、夜晚送。终于按时地把千家万户的口粮，一次又一次地送到居民家里。
    令闻第一粮站所以战胜重重困难，坚持送粮达三年之久，主要是全体职工认识到自己肩负责任的光荣和重要，了解到粮食供应工作的深刻意义，并有一颗处处为群众着想的心。推车送粮的营业员陈兴第，即使遇到倾盆大雨，不管路怎么难走，也要把粮食用雨布苫好，推着手推车东家出西家进，把粮食按时送到户。曾经在旧社会住过粮栈，目睹过资本家囤积居奇的五十七岁的营业员崔炳焕，今天看到广大群众不再为吃粮而奔波的情景时，更加老当益壮，他说：“只要群众感到方便，我们再麻烦，也心甘情愿！”
