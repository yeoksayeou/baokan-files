    The "Nimble Little Craftsman" Huang Guangyao was staring intently, unmoving, lost in thought again, all in the name of saving two minutes. Anyone who knew him knew that this eighteen-year-old was once again working on his personal daily summary, trying to find a clever trick.
    On August 6th, while processing the "studs" for locomotives, others were producing sixty-two pieces a day, while Huang Guangyao made one hundred and three. However, he still felt that there were four minor, unnecessary steps in the process. Each piece wasted two minutes unnecessarily. This loophole had to be closed.
    On August 7th, Huang Guangyao removed the four unnecessary steps, reclaiming those two minutes from each piece, increasing his daily output to one hundred and fifty, earning praise from the Party organization and his comrades. After the quitting time bell rang, he was again unmoving, lost in thought. He felt that stopping the machine each time to push the center point wasted forty seconds. With a large number of pieces, the waste was significant, and this was not in line with the spirit of increasing production and practicing thrift.
    Therefore, at the start of work on the 8th, he adopted the method of pushing the center point without stopping the machine, reclaiming those forty seconds. That day, daily output soared to two hundred and thirty-seven pieces, with all products meeting quality standards.
    Huang Guangyao is an apprentice at the Chengdu Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, and his technical skills are not particularly high. However, because he insists on daily summaries, he has already achieved one hundred and sixty-four innovations this year, completing the workload of one year and eight months in just half a year. Some young workers in the factory jokingly said to him:
  “You really are a summary fanatic.” Huang Guangyao replied, “It is precisely because I have insisted on summarizing experience in every shift and innovating technology every day that I have achieved daily progress.”

    灵巧的小工匠
    为了节约两分钟，黄光耀又瞪着眼一动不动地在想心事。熟悉他的人一看就知道，这个十八岁的
  “灵巧的小工匠”又在搞他的个人每日总结，想办法找窍门了。
    8月6日这天，在加工机车的配件“栽丝”时，别人一天干六十二件，黄光耀做了一百三。但是，他仍然感到加工中有四个小的操作过程是不必要的。每车一根，就白白浪费了两分钟。这个漏洞必须堵塞。
    8月7日，黄光耀把四个不必要的操作过程去掉了，从每件活上抓回了这两分钟，日产量提高到一百五，得到了党组织和同志们的赞扬。下班吃饭铃响后，他又一动不动地在想心事。他觉得每车一根要停一次车，去推一次顶针，得花四十秒。根数多，浪费就大了，这不符合增产节约的精神。
    于是，在8日一上班，他就采用不停车顶顶针的办法，把这四十秒又夺了回来。这天，日产量飞升到二百三十七件，产品质量全部合格。
    黄光耀是成都机车车辆工厂的学徒工，技术水平并不高。但是由于他坚持每日总结，今年以来已经实现了一百六十四项革新，半年就完成了一年零八个月的工作量。厂里有些青年工人对他开玩笑地说：
  “你真是个总结迷”。黄光耀回答说：“正因为我坚持了班班总结经验，天天革新技术，才实现了日日红。”
