    People need clothes, and commodities need packaging. If people wear too little clothing, they will catch a cold. If commodities are not well packaged, they will deteriorate or be damaged. For example, light bulbs will be broken, medicines will spoil, paper and cloth will be soiled or torn, and chemical products may even cause accidents. Poor packaging will cause trouble in loading, unloading, transportation, storage, and sales, making it difficult to deliver goods to consumers and users in the right quantity and quality. Therefore, commodity packaging is an integral part of commodity production. All departments and enterprises must pay as much attention to commodity packaging as they do to commodity manufacturing and should not allow unpackaged or poorly packaged commodities to leave the factory.
    In capitalist society, commodity packaging is often an advertising means for capitalists to compete for sales. Therefore, the packaging of many commodities is extremely luxurious, and the packaging cost is sometimes higher than the commodity manufacturing cost. Of course, we are completely opposed to the capitalists' practices. Socialist commodity production is to meet the needs of the people's life and production. The manufacturing and packaging of commodities should be thrifty, strive for durability, simplicity, beauty, and elegance. However, we must never reduce the quality of packaging because of saving money. There are many kinds of commodities, some are afraid of wind, some are afraid of sun, some are afraid of rain, some are sold locally, and some are transported to other places. Packaging should be carried out according to the different properties and characteristics of different commodities. Saving money without guaranteeing the quality of packaging is not saving money, but a greater waste. "Achieving success just inches from the finish line," this not only wastes packaging materials and the labor of packaging workers, but also wastes the labor of commodity manufacturing workers. Therefore, with a high degree of responsibility to the country and consumers, on the one hand, we must save all possible packaging materials, and on the other hand, we must ensure the quality of packaging. We must consider the different conditions such as commodity performance, transportation distance, and storage time. What kind of materials should be used for packaging, how thick should the packaging be. In order to reduce packaging costs, substitute materials should be vigorously used on the premise of ensuring packaging quality.
    To pack well, we must have packaging materials. In the past few years, China's commodity production has developed rapidly, and the number, variety, and specifications of products have grown rapidly. Although the production of packaging materials has also grown rapidly, the quantity and quality of some varieties still cannot meet the needs of commodity growth. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the production of packaging supplies and materials. Industrial and commercial departments must arrange the production of packaging supplies and materials at the same time when arranging commodity production plans and commodity circulation. We must ensure that commodity development is planned, and packaging supplies and materials are also planned. It is better to let packaging supplies wait for commodities than to let commodities wait for packaging supplies. The packaging supplies and materials in various places, in addition to a very small part relying on the state to allocate from other places, should strive to be self-sufficient. This is not only convenient for unifying the arrangement of commodity production and the arrangement of packaging materials production, but also can avoid long-distance transportation, thereby reducing transportation losses and reducing costs.
    Strengthening recycling is also an important source of expanding packaging supplies. Some packaging supplies can no longer be used after being used once, but there are also many packaging supplies, such as flour bags, sacks, cement bags, various glass bottles, etc., which can be used several times. Those that cannot be used to package the original goods can also be used in a downgraded manner; those that cannot even be used in a downgraded manner can be used as raw materials for reprocessing and manufacturing. This is in line with the spirit of making the best use of everything and practicing thrift. The potential for recycling packaging supplies is not only great, but also inexhaustible. The more commodities in social circulation, the more packaging supplies can be recycled. The key lies in taking the mass line and strengthening the organization and leadership of recycling work. We should widely publicize and mobilize store employees, and at the same time, regularly send people to the streets and alleys to collect packaging supplies scattered in the hands of consumers and packaging supplies scattered in stores and enterprises, good ones, bad ones, whole ones, and zero ones, as much as possible. The Tianjin Purchasing and Wholesale Station recycled more than 300,000 various bottles in about ten days. This shows that as long as we earnestly rely on the masses, the road to recycling packaging supplies is wide.

### 重视商品包装

    重视商品包装
    人要穿衣，商品要包装。人衣服穿少了就会伤风感冒。商品包装不好，就会变质或碰坏，例如灯泡会被打碎，药品会变质，纸张、布匹会弄脏拉破，化工产品甚至会因此发生事故。商品包装不好，装卸、运输、保管、销售都要发生麻烦，很难按质按量地送到消费者和使用者手里。因此，商品包装是商品生产的一个组成部分，任何部门，任何企业，都要像重视商品制造一样重视商品包装，不应该让不包装或包装不好的商品出厂。
    在资本主义社会，商品包装常常是资本家竞销商品的一种广告手段，所以许多商品的包装极尽华丽的能事，包装成本有时比商品制造成本还高。我们当然同资本家的做法完全相反，社会主义的商品生产，是为了满足人民的生活和生产的需要。商品的制造和包装，都要厉行节约，力求坚固耐用，朴素、美观、大方。但是，绝不能因为节约而降低包装质量。商品种类繁多，有怕风吹的，有怕日晒的，有怕雨淋的，有的就地销售，有的运往外地销售，应当根据不同商品的性能和特点进行包装。不保证包装质量的节约不是节约，而是更大的浪费。为山九仞，功亏一篑，这不只是浪费包装材料，浪费包装工人的劳动，连商品制造工人的劳动也浪费了。因此，必须以高度的对国家、对消费者负责的精神，一方面要节约一切可以节约的包装材料，另方面还要保证包装质量，要考虑商品性能、运途远近、保存时间的长短等不同条件，该用什么样的材料包装，就用什么样的材料，该包装多厚就包装多厚。为了降低包装成本，应当在保证包装质量的前提下，大力使用代用材料。
    要包装好就得有包装材料。几年来，我国商品生产在飞跃发展，产品数量、品种、规格都增长得很快。包装材料的生产虽然也增长得很快，但是，有些品种的数量和质量仍然不能满足商品增长的需要。因此，必须增加包装用品和材料的生产。工业部门和商业部门，在安排商品生产计划和商品流通的时候，一定要同时安排包装用品和材料的生产，要做到商品有计划地发展，包装用品和材料也有计划地发展。宁可让包装用品来等商品，不可让商品来等包装用品。各地的包装用品和材料，除了极少部分依靠国家从外地调拨外，都要力求自给。这样做，既便于把安排商品的生产和安排包装材料的生产统一起来，又可以避免长途运输，从而减少运输损耗和降低成本。
    加强回收工作，也是扩大包装用品的一个重要来源。有些包装用品，用过一次就不能再用了，但也有许多包装用品，如面粉袋、麻袋、水泥袋，各种玻璃瓶等等，可以连用好几次。不能用来包装原来商品的，也可以降格使用；连降格使用也够不上的，可以当作原料，重新加工制造。这是符合物尽其用和厉行节约精神的。包装用品回收的潜力不只很大，而且永远挖不完。社会流通的商品愈多，可以回收的包装用品也就愈多。关键在于走群众路线加强回收的组织领导工作。应当广泛宣传，把商店职工发动起来，同时经常派人深入街道里弄，把分散在消费者手里的包装用品，把分散在商店里、企业里的包装用品，好的，次的，整的，零的，尽量收集起来。天津市采购批发站，十天左右就回收了各种瓶子三十多万个。这就说明，只要认真依靠群众，回收包装用品的道路是宽阔的。
