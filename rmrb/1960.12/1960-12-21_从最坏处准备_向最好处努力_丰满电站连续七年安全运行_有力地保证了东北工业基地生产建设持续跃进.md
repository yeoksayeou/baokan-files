Xinhua News Agency, Jilin - The Fengman Hydropower Station in Jilin has set a record of 770 consecutive days of safe power generation and 2,697 consecutive days of safe operation. Because of the good safety work, the smooth completion of power generation and supply tasks has been guaranteed.

The Fengman Hydropower Station is one of the main power stations in the Northeast Power Grid. In order to ensure the continuous leap forward of industrial production in the Northeast, this power station has comprehensively implemented the electricity production policy of "generate more, supply more, safety and economy" since 1958. Under the circumstances of continuously increasing load and continuously increasing power generation, the safety work is continuously strengthened, and with the guiding ideology of "preparing for the worst and striving for the best," the masses are mobilized to unremittingly fight against all kinds of major and minor, obvious and hidden accidents. In the past two years, the entire power station has eliminated more than 10,000 hidden dangers, ensuring that this large-scale and complex power station can always maintain safe production.

Carrying out a mass "100 Accident Pre-thinking" campaign, so that all power station employees fully grasp the laws of safe production and accident occurrence, is the main reason for the power station's long-term safe production achievements. In the movement, they adopted the method of combining cadres, workers, and technicians, consulted historical accident data from the factory and other factories, and learned lessons from them; consulted construction and installation materials and literature, and absorbed foreign experience. In addition, employees are stationed at their posts, keep abreast of the operating status of the equipment at any time, analyze the seasonal changes in power production, and take measures to prevent weak links and equipment defects as early as possible. Now, the pre-thinking movement has become a regular activity for all employees. There are not only long-term pre-thinking, seasonal pre-thinking, and special pre-thinking, but also operation personnel conduct pre-thinking on the safety production situation of the day and shift according to the actual operating situation.

Through extensive pre-thinking activities, the entire power station has successively discovered tens of thousands of unsafe factors. In response to these unsafe factors, the power station's Party committee organized the masses to set up "three lines of defense." The first line of defense is planned maintenance, that is, to eliminate unsafe factors in a planned and batch-by-batch manner. The second line of defense is piecemeal maintenance, that is, under normal operating conditions, seize every opportunity to eliminate unsafe factors anytime, anywhere. The third line of defense is to strengthen daily maintenance work to prevent the emergence of new unsafe factors. In this way, many unsafe factors are quickly transformed into safety factors, while preventing and reducing the occurrence of new unsafe factors.

In the "100 Accident Pre-thinking" campaign, the power station also mobilized the masses to analyze, study, and systematically summarize the discovered unsafe factors, find out the general laws of accident occurrence and safe production, and then formulate measures and adopt countermeasures. For example, in response to the continuous wear of various equipment during operation, equipment archives were established, and inspection procedures and inspection plans for different equipment were formulated; in response to the impact of external natural conditions such as wind, rain, thunder, water, and temperature on the normal operation of the equipment, measures such as preventing wind damage, preventing rain damage, preventing lightning damage, preventing water damage, and preventing cold insulation were formulated; in the spring thaw period, summer flood season, and winter icing period, large-scale accident prevention campaigns are carried out to turn these seasons that are prone to accidents into safe production seasons. In addition, the management of safe production has been established and improved, and fifty-two rules and regulations have been revised. The materials supply department went deep into the front line of production during the pre-thinking movement, inspected and improved the supply of equipment materials and spare parts.

Continuously strengthening safety education is another important experience for the power station to achieve safe production. They often oppose complacency and arrogance among employees, and use various forms such as broadcasting, blackboards, and big-character posters to remind employees to pay attention to unsafe factors during safe production at any time and anywhere. In addition, they also frequently organize anti-accident drills, safety military training, safety exams, and safety training activities. Through these activities, employees have improved their operating skills and anti-accident capabilities. Many workers are not only able to use their senses such as ears and eyes and with the help of instruments and meters to keenly discover the signs of accidents, but also are good at quickly and decisively eliminating accidents in the bud.

    从最坏处准备　向最好处努力
    丰满电站连续七年安全运行
    有力地保证了东北工业基地生产建设持续跃进
    据新华社吉林电　吉林丰满水电站创造了连续七百七十天安全发电、连续二千六百九十七天安全运行的纪录。由于安全工作做得好，保证了发电、供电任务的顺利完成。
    丰满水电站是东北电力网的主力电站之一。这个电站为了保证东北工业生产的持续跃进，从1958年以来，全面贯彻了“多发多供，安全经济”的电业生产方针。在负荷不断增加、发电量不断增长的情况下，不断加强安全工作，以“从最坏处准备，向最好处努力”的指导思想，发动群众不懈地与各种重大的和细小的、明显的和隐蔽的事故进行斗争，两年来，全电站先后消灭了上万件隐患，保证了这个规模宏大、设备复杂的电站能经常保持安全生产。
    开展群众性的“百件事故预想”运动，使全电站职工充分掌握安全生产和事故发生的规律，是这个电站取得长期安全生产成绩的主要原因。运动中，他们采用干部、工人、技术人员三结合的方法，查阅了本厂和外厂历史上的事故资料，从中吸取教训；查阅建筑安装的材料文献，吸收国外经验。此外，职工们还分兵把口，随时了解设备的运行情况，分析电业生产的季节性变化，对薄弱环节和设备缺陷采取措施，及早预防。现在，预想运动已成为全站职工经常性的活动，不仅有长期性的预想、季节性的预想和专题预想，而且运行人员还根据实际运行情况，对当日、当班的安全生产情况进行预想。
    通过广泛的预想活动，全电站陆续发掘出数以万计的不安全因素。针对这些不安全因素，电站党委组织群众设置了“三道防线”。第一道防线是计划检修，即有计划地、分批地消灭不安全因素。第二道防线是零星检修，即在正常运行的条件下，见缝插针，随时随地消灭不安全因素。第三道防线是加强日常维护工作，防止新的不安全因素出现。这样就使许多不安全因素都迅速转化为安全因素，同时防止和减少了新的不安全因素的出现。
    在“百件事故预想”运动中，这个电站还发动群众对发现了的不安全因素进行分析研究和系统总结，找出事故发生和安全生产的普遍规律，然后制订措施，采取对策。例如，他们针对各种设备在运行中不断磨损的情况，设立了设备档案，制订了不同设备的检修规程和检修计划；针对风、雨、雷、水、温等外界自然条件影响设备正常运行的情况，制订了防风害、防雨害、防雷害、防水害、防寒保温等措施；在春季解冻期、夏季汛期、冬季结冰期，开展大规模的防止事故运动，把这些容易发生事故的季节变成安全生产季节。此外，还建立和健全了安全生产的管理工作，修订了五十二项规章制度。材料供应部门在预想运动中，深入生产第一线，检查和改进了设备材料和备品配件的供应工作。
    不断加强安全教育，是这个电站能够实现安全生产的另一条重要经验。他们经常在职工中反对麻痹大意、骄傲自满的情绪，用广播、黑板报、大字报等多种形式，随时随地提醒职工在安全生产时注意不安全的因素。此外，他们还经常组织反事故演习、安全大练兵、安全考试和安全集训等活动。通过这些活动，职工们提高了操作水平和反事故能力。许多工人不仅能够用耳、目等感觉器官和借助仪器、仪表，敏锐地发现事故苗头，而且善于迅速果断地把事故消灭于萌芽状态。
