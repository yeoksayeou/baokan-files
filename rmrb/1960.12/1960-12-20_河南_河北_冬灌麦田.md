    Henan and Hebei
    Winter Irrigation of Wheat Fields
    According to Xinhua News Agency reports: Winter irrigation of wheat in Henan Province has expanded from selected points to a wider area, with Xinxiang and Kaifeng prefectures progressing rapidly, having already irrigated over two million mu of wheat for root establishment.

    Winter irrigation of wheat is an important measure for Henan Province to strive for a good wheat harvest next year, and Party committees at all levels attach great importance to it. Party secretaries at all levels in Xinxiang, Kaifeng, Luoyang and other prefectures are personally focusing on key winter irrigation areas while also supervising the repair of irrigation projects and water lifting machinery. Kaifeng Prefecture specifically organized 560 water conservancy cadres to go to communes and production teams to provide concrete assistance in winter irrigation work.

    During the winter irrigation, various localities have established responsibility systems, which has greatly improved irrigation efficiency. In Xinxiang Prefecture, after implementing a responsibility system in Beizhai Brigade of Nanzhai Commune in Huixian County, the irrigation efficiency increased from 15 mu per day to 45 mu, and the quality also improved. Various localities have implemented a labor exchange system, allowing commune members to work and rest, and due to round-the-clock irrigation, water is saved and the irrigation progress is accelerated. Dongsizhuang Brigade of Nancaizhuang Commune in Yanshi County implemented a shift system and irrigated 1,100 mu of land in four days.

    In order to save fuel oil for winter irrigation machinery, Luoyang Prefecture is vigorously promoting the gasification of machinery, which can save fuel oil while fully utilizing the role of irrigation machinery. Twenty-two communes in nine counties, including Yiyang, Xinan, Yanshi, and Mengjin, have transferred 284 technicians and 25 iron and wood workers to specifically modify irrigation machinery; the modified machinery saves 56% to 63% of the original fuel consumption.

    In order to ensure that all wheat fields with irrigation conditions are winter irrigated before the ground freezes, various localities are stepping up the repair of canals and water storage.

    According to Xinhua News Agency reports: Hebei Province is actively organizing commune members to carry out winter irrigation, water storage, development of deep groundwater, and water conservancy project supporting work to prevent spring drought next year and achieve a bumper agricultural harvest.

    Spring drought and little rain are natural characteristics of Hebei Province. In particular, from last autumn to the first half of this year, most areas have not had significant rainfall for nearly 300 days, and the general soil moisture content is relatively poor. Therefore, winter irrigation and water storage to conserve soil moisture have become key measures to ensure timely spring sowing and strive for a summer harvest. Various localities have formulated winter irrigation plans at all levels based on water conservancy projects, water source conditions, and wheat sowing, in accordance with the principle of adapting to local conditions. Cadres at the county, commune, and team levels in Shulu County, together with commune members, have universally checked the soil moisture, water sources, animal power, and irrigation tools. They classified wheat fields with different soil qualities (black, sandy, red, yellow, alkaline, etc.) and different soil moisture levels, and calculated the time, tasks, and fuel consumption. They organized the masses for winter irrigation. In order to tap the potential of water sources, various localities have strengthened irrigation management. Larger irrigation areas have generally established irrigation committees, fixed water outlets, trained water distributors and water measurers, and implemented planned water use. As of December 9, the winter irrigation area in the province had reached more than 2.55 million mu.

    Various localities are also seizing the time to carry out supporting work for small-scale water conservancy projects in accordance with the principle of "building and utilizing simultaneously." Under the unified leadership of the Party committee of Bachigang Commune in Luanxian County, Tangshan City, each production team organized teams for leveling land, building ridges, digging canals, digging wells, and repairing machinery to carry out project supporting and land leveling work.

    In order to increase water sources for winter irrigation and spring irrigation next year, various localities are actively carrying out large-scale interception and storage, developing deep groundwater, and building small-scale water conservancy projects with quick returns while utilizing existing projects.

    When carrying out the above work, all counties and communes have paid attention to combining work and rest. (Attached picture)

    河南·河北
    冬灌麦田
    据新华社讯　河南各地小麦冬灌工作已由点向面展开，进度较快的新乡、开封两个专区已浇小麦盘根水二百多万亩。
    冬灌小麦是河南省争取明年小麦丰收的一项重要措施，各级党委十分重视。新乡、开封、洛阳等专区的各级党委书记，都是一面亲自抓冬灌重点地区，一面督促检修灌溉工程和提水机械。开封专区专门组织了五百六十名水利干部到公社、生产队，具体帮助搞好冬灌工作。
    在冬灌中，各地都制定了责任制度，使浇地效率大为提高。新乡专区辉县南寨公社北寨大队实行责任制后，浇地效率由日浇十五亩提高到四十五亩，而且质量也好。各地实行劳力换班制度，使社员有劳有逸，而且由于日夜轮浇，既节约了用水，又加快了浇地进度。偃师县南才庄公社东寺庄大队实行换班制，四天就浇地一千一百亩。
    为了节约冬灌机械用油，洛阳专区大搞机械煤气化，在充分发挥灌溉机械作用的前提下，又能节约燃油。宜阳、新安、偃师、孟津等九个县的二十二个公社，抽调二百八十四名技术员和二十五名铁木工人专门改制灌溉机械；已改制的机械比原来节省用油56％到63％。
    各地为了争取在封冻前使有灌溉条件的麦田全部冬灌，正在加紧整修渠道和蓄水。
    据新华社讯　河北各地积极组织社员进行冬灌、蓄水、开发地下深层水和水利工程配套等工作，预防明年春旱，夺取农业丰收。
    春旱少雨是河北各地的自然特点，特别是从去秋到今年上半年大部分地区近三百天未下透雨，一般土地墒情基础较差。因此，进行冬灌和蓄水保墒成为保证及时春播和争取夏季丰收的关键性措施。各地根据水利工程、水源条件和麦田播种等情况，本着因地制宜的原则，层层制定了冬灌计划。束鹿县县社队三级干部和社员一起，普遍检查了墒情、水源、畜力和灌溉工具的情况。并把黑、沙、红、黄、碱等不同土质和不同墒情的麦田进行了分类排队，算清了时间、任务、燃料几笔账。组织群众进行冬灌。为了挖掘水源潜力，各地都加强了灌溉管理工作。较大的灌区普遍建立了灌溉委员会，固定配水口，训练配水员、量水员，实行计划用水。到12月9日止，全省冬灌面积已达二百五十五万多亩。
    各地还根据“边兴修、边利用”的原则，抓紧小型水利工程的配套工作。唐山市滦县扒齿港公社在公社党委统一领导下，各生产队都组织起平地打畦、开渠、打井、检修机具队伍，开展了工程配套和平整土地工作。
    为了增加冬灌和明年春灌的水源，各地在利用现有工程的同时，积极进行大拦大蓄，开发地下深层水和兴修收益快的小型水利工程。
    各县、社在进行以上工作的时候，都注意了劳逸结合。（附图片）
