Xinhua News Agency, December 5th: Leopoldville dispatch: In Kikwit (an important base of the African Solidarity Party), 250 miles east of the Congolese capital, local Bombala people have risen up to resist the suppression and atrocities of the Mobutu traitorous clique's paratroopers.

It is reported that when Prime Minister Lumumba passed through Kikwit before being kidnapped, the Bombala people warmly welcomed him. Therefore, Mobutu sent his paratroopers to suppress them, but these paratroopers were resisted by the local people. The news of Lumumba's kidnapping further angered the Bombala people, who rose up and fought Mobutu's paratroopers with stones. As of the afternoon of the 4th, fighting was still ongoing. The news said that as of the 4th, twelve tribal people had been killed and twenty-two wounded by Mobutu's troops.

The Governor of Leopoldville Province and leader of the African Solidarity Party, Kamitatu, has written to Mobutu protesting his dispatch of troops to massacre unarmed people and warned that the people there know how to defend Kikwit.

According to reports from Stanleyville, the people of Stanleyville, enraged by Mobutu's atrocities in kidnapping Lumumba, are intensifying their actions to strike at the colonialists and defend Congolese independence in order to counter the conspiracies planned by the imperialists.

According to the Indian Press Trust on the 4th, Prime Minister Lumumba, who is being illegally detained in Thysville, continues to be tortured by the Mobutu clique. The news agency quoted UN authorities as saying that Lumumba suffered serious injuries to his face and one leg, and one of his fingers has been cut off. With the support of imperialism, the Mobutu traitorous clique is stepping up its conspiracy to undermine Congolese independence. According to Agence France-Presse, the Mobutu traitors announced on the 4th that they plan to establish a "provisional government of the Republic of the Congo," which will be composed of members of his "Committee of Commissioners."

    刚果基奎特人民抗击蒙博托叛军镇压
    卢蒙巴遭到残酷折磨　蒙博托宣布要建立“临时政府”
    新华社5日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：在刚果首都以东二百五十英里的基奎特（非洲团结党的重要根据地之一），当地的邦巴拉族人民纷纷奋起抗击蒙博托叛国集团伞兵的镇压暴行。
    据报道，卢蒙巴总理在被绑架前路过基奎特时，邦巴拉族人曾经热烈欢迎了他，因此蒙博托就派他的伞兵前往镇压，但是，这些伞兵遭到当地人民的反抗。卢蒙巴被绑架的消息更加激怒了邦巴拉族人民，他们纷纷起来用石头同蒙博托的伞兵进行搏斗。到4日下午，战斗仍在进行中。消息说，到4日为止，已有十二名部族人民被蒙博托军队打死、二十二人被打伤。
    利奥波德维尔省省长、非洲团结党领袖卡米塔图已写信给蒙博托抗议他派兵屠杀手无寸铁的人民的暴行，并且提出警告说，那里的人民是知道怎样来保卫基奎特的。
    据来自斯坦利维尔的消息说，被蒙博托绑架卢蒙巴的暴行激怒了的斯坦利维尔人民，以加紧打击殖民者和保卫刚果独立的行动来对付帝国主义者所策划的阴谋。
    据印度报业托辣斯4日报道，被非法囚禁在太斯维尔的卢蒙巴总理继续遭到蒙博托集团的折磨。这家通讯社援引联合国当局的消息说，卢蒙巴的脸部和一条腿受了重伤，他的一个手指已经被切断。在帝国主义的支持下，蒙博托叛国集团加紧进行破坏刚果独立的阴谋活动。据法新社报道，蒙博托叛国分子4日宣布，他计划成立一个“刚果共和国临时政府”，这个“政府”由他的“专员委员会”成员组成。
