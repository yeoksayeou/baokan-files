Xinhua News Agency, Havana, December 1st. Cuban newspaper *Hoy* published a commentary today entitled "Friendship," stating that the results of the Cuban Revolutionary Government's economic delegation's visit to China proved "the eternal friendship between our two revolutionary and peace-loving countries." The commentary said that Major Guevara's statement that the friendship between the Cuban and Chinese people would last as long as the snow on the Himalayas "is not just a beautiful phrase. Life confirms this truth with its beauty that surpasses language."

The commentary discussed the agreements and protocols signed by the Chinese and Cuban governments in Beijing. The commentary said, "These negotiations explain why the Cuban people are watching with confidence and interest the visits of its competent representatives to socialist countries." The commentary said that the results of the Cuban government's economic delegation's visits to socialist countries will "gain time in Cuba's industrialization, the development of diverse crops in agriculture, the rapid improvement of our people's living standards, and the consolidation of our national economy."

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, December 1st. Cuban newspapers today warmly praised the economic cooperation agreement and the 1961 trade protocol signed between China and Cuba.

An editorial in *Revolución* stated that China has not only increased its purchases of sugar from Cuba, but is also prepared to provide Cuba with the equipment needed to develop its agricultural programs and economic progress. The newspaper said, "This is because this great Eastern country has vast resources, and its production figures are updated daily, and these figures are always being exceeded."

The newspaper pointed out that the economic cooperation agreement signed between the two countries proves that "under the guidance of the theory of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, China is rapidly becoming a great power."

*Revolución* ridiculed the slanderous propaganda of the American news agencies about China, pointing out that the People's China, which has freed itself from the backwardness of more than a hundred years caused by the semi-feudal system, has taken a big step towards the future due to the high enthusiasm of its 600 million people. "This is an example for all people who are looking for their own independent road; at the same time, for those who have obtained her unreserved support, this also means assistance."

*Combate* pointed out in its commentary on China's aid to Cuba that the agreements signed with People's China and other socialist countries are genuine bilateral agreements and contribute to achieving Cuba's economic goals. *Prensa Libre* commented that although relations with the People's Republic of China have only just begun, they have already yielded results in the broad economic field.

*Liberación*, in a commentary entitled "True Friendship," stated, "The People's Republic of China has just provided a new proof of the sincere friendship and support of socialist countries to Cuba." "We have been provided with an interest-free loan of 60 million pesos, which is an unprecedented event in our diplomatic and trade relations." The newspaper, in comparing China's aid with the so-called "aid" from the United States, said, "The People's Republic of China is only helping a friendly country and providing it with the assistance it can provide." The newspaper then said, but "American loans with interest rates as high as 6% only benefit American companies. This is the assistance of usurers to the poor. They even strip the poor of their shirts and hold their throats to force them to submit." The newspaper said that the support of socialist countries is completely different. The unconditional, interest-free loan of 60 million pesos provided by the People's Republic of China is proof of this.

    古巴舆论热烈赞扬中古友谊新成果
    “今日报”说古巴政府经济代表团的访问结果有助于古巴民族经济的发展
    “街道报”说中古经济合作协定证明中国正在迅速成为伟大的强国
    “解放报”说中国的援助是社会主义国家对古巴真诚友谊和支持的证明
    新华社哈瓦那1日电　古巴《今日报》今天以《友谊》为题发表评论说，古巴革命政府经济代表团对中国的访问的结果，证明了“我们这两个革命的和爱好和平的国家之间的永恒友谊”。评论说，格瓦拉少校所说的古巴和中国人民之间的友谊将像喜马拉雅山的白雪一样永世长存这句话，“不仅仅是一个美丽的词句。生活以它的超过语言的美好证实了这个真理。”
    评论谈到中古两国政府在北京签订的协定和议定书。评论说，“这些谈判说明了古巴人民为什么怀着信心和兴趣注视着它的称职的代表对社会主义世界各国的访问”。评论说，古巴政府经济代表团对社会主义国家的访问的结果将是在古巴“工业化、发展农业的多种作物、迅速提高我国人民的生活水平过程中，并且在巩固我们的民族经济方面赢得时间。”
    新华社哈瓦那1日电　古巴报纸今天热烈赞扬中国同古巴签订的经济合作协定和1961年贸易议定书。
    《街道报》的评论说，中国不仅仅增加了它向古巴购买的食糖，而且准备向古巴提供为发展古巴的农业计划和经济进步所需要的设备。这家报纸说，“这是因为这个伟大的东方国家拥有广大的资源，它的生产数字每日在更新，这些数字总是被超过。”
    报纸指出，两国签订的经济合作协定证明了“在工农业同时并举的理论指导下，中国正在迅速地成为一个伟大的强国。”
    《街道报》嘲笑美国通讯社关于中国的诽谤宣传，它指出，从半封建制度所导致的百余年的落后状况中摆脱出来的人民中国，由于她的六亿人民的高涨的积极性，已经向未来跃进了一大步。这对所有寻找自己独立道路的人民来说是一个榜样；同时对取得她的无保留的支援的人们说来，这也意味着是一种援助”。
    《战斗报》在评论中国对古巴的援助时指出，同人民中国以及其它社会主义国家签订的协定是真正的双边协定，有助于达到古巴的经济目的。《自由新闻报》评论说，尽管同中华人民共和国的关系刚刚开始，但是已经从广阔的经济领域上带来了成果。
    《解放报》在题为真正的友谊的评论里说，“中华人民共和国刚刚提供了社会主义国家对古巴的真诚的友谊和支援的一个新证明”。“已经向我们提供了六千万比索的无息贷款，这是我国外交和贸易关系上史无前例的事件。这家报纸在对比中国的援助和美国的所谓“援助”时说，“中华人民共和国只是援助一个友好的国家、向它提供所能够提供的援助。”这家报纸接着说，可是“美国利息高达6％的贷款只对美国企业有利。这是高利贷者对穷人的援助。他们甚至剥掉了穷人的衬衫，扼住穷人的咽喉迫使他们屈服。”报纸说，社会主义国家的支援完全不同。中华人民共和国提供的六千万比索的不附带条件的无息贷款就是一个证明。
