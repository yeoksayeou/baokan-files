    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 8th.  Vietnamese Democratic Republic Deputy Foreign Minister Ung Van Khiem, at a press conference held this afternoon, announced the statement issued by the Vietnamese Democratic Republic Foreign Ministry regarding the US and Thai military intervention in Laos.

    The statement pointed out that recently, US imperialism and its vassal states, such as Thailand, are again carrying out new and extremely serious interference in Laos: the US is using airplanes to continuously transport many military weapons and military supplies from military bases in Bangkok and Manila to places such as Savannakhet, Luang Prabang, and Xieng Khouang, supplying the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group armies currently engaged in war in North Cading; US officers are directly participating in commanding the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group's armies; using Thai territory as a base for sending troops; Thai troops are coordinating artillery shelling of Lao Royal Army strongholds from across the Mekong River; at the same time, the US Seventh Fleet has been dispatched to the East Coast and has announced its readiness to intervene in Laos at any time.

    The statement continued by pointing out that the above actions prove that US imperialism and its Thai vassals are helping the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group realize its plan of militarily attacking Vientiane and overthrowing the legitimate Lao Royal Government headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma, in order to establish a reactionary government that acts as a US lackey. These actions are part of the US imperialist plot to intensify the sabotage of the Lao Kingdom's policy of peace, neutrality, and national harmony, to expand and prolong the Lao civil war, and to transform Laos into a base for US imperialism to launch war.

    The statement strongly condemned the US imperialism and its vassal Thailand for repeatedly and brazenly interfering in Laos, disregarding the repeated protests of the Lao Kingdom Government and the resolute opposition of the Lao people. The statement pointed out that this increasingly large-scale and blatant interference seriously violates the Geneva Agreements on Laos, undermines peace in Laos, Indochina, and Southeast Asia, and threatens the security of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic.

    The statement emphasized that, as a party to the Geneva Agreements on Laos and a neighbor of Laos, the Vietnamese Democratic Republic government resolutely opposes and sternly warns against the US imperialism and its Thai vassals' extremely blatant, crude, and dangerous interference in Laos, and demands that they immediately cease such interference. US imperialism and the countries that follow it must bear full responsibility for the consequences they cause.

    The statement concluded by requesting the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference and the participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina to take effective measures to stop the US imperialism and its running dogs from interfering in Laos.

    越南外交部声明揭露美泰援助老挝叛乱集团扩大内战
    要求制止美国干涉老挝内政的行为
    新华社河内8日电　越南民主共和国外交部副部长雍文谦在今天下午举行的记者招待会上，公布了越南民主共和国外交部就美国和泰国军事干涉老挝一事所发表的声明。
    声明指出，最近，美帝国主义及其仆从国家如泰国，又在对老挝进行着新的、极为严重的干涉：美国正在把许多军事武器和军用物资用飞机接连从曼谷和马尼拉军事基地，运到沙湾拿吉、琅勃拉邦和川圹等地，供给正在发生战争的北卡定的富米·诺萨万叛乱集团军队；美国军官直接参加指挥富米·诺萨万叛乱集团的军队；利用泰国土地作为出兵的基地；泰国军队在湄公河彼岸配合炮击老挝王国军队的据点；同时，美国第七舰队被派到东海岸，并宣布随时干涉老挝。
    声明接着指出，上述行动证明，美帝国主义及其泰国仆从，正在帮助富米·诺萨万叛乱集团实现军事进攻万象和推翻以梭发那·富马亲王为首的老挝王国合法政府的计划，以建立一个充当美国走狗的反动政府。这些行动，是美帝国主义正在加紧破坏老挝王国的和平中立和民族和睦政策，扩大和拖延老挝内战，并把老挝变为美帝国主义发动战争基地等侵略阴谋的一部分。
    声明强烈谴责美帝国主义及其仆从泰国不顾老挝王国政府的多次抗议和老挝人民的坚决反对而一再蛮横干涉老挝的行为。声明指出，这种规模日益扩大的蛮横干涉，严重地违反了关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，破坏了老挝、印度支那和东南亚的和平，威胁着越南民主共和国的安全。
    声明强调说，作为签订关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的一方和老挝的邻国，越南民主共和国政府坚决反对和严厉警告美帝国主义及其泰国仆从极其明目张胆地、粗暴地和危险地干涉老挝的行为，并要求它们必须立即停止这种干涉。美帝国主义和追随它的国家必须对他们造成的后果负完全责任。
    声明最后要求日内瓦会议两位主席和1954年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议参加国采取有效措施，以制止美帝国主义及其走狗干涉老挝的行为。
