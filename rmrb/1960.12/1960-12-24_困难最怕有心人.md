Difficulties Fear the Determined

"Nothing is impossible to a willing heart." Almost everyone knows these two sentences. However, "nothing is impossible" requires a prerequisite, which is that there must first be a "willing heart." Without a "willing heart," difficulties remain difficulties. Therefore, this word "heart" is of great significance.

What kind of heart? First of all, it is the determination to overcome difficulties. If there is a lack of courage to overcome difficulties, difficulties will not only always exist, but even small difficulties will turn into big difficulties. "Difficulties are like springs, it depends on how strong you are; if you are strong, it is weak, if you are weak, it is strong." This is the conclusion the masses have drawn about difficulties!

To deal with difficulties, it is not enough to have determination, you must also be careful. Every difficulty has its own temperament. Without understanding its temperament, rushing in blindly will inevitably lead to setbacks. This temperament is what we usually call objective laws. Only by carefully studying and seriously treating objective laws can we use them to continuously win victories and continuously move forward!

Determination and carefulness are what we call a "willing heart." Wang Baojing, Gao Yubao, and Tan Haiquan are such "willing hearts." Relying on this heart, they won victories in production and on the battlefield in the past; today, they are conquering scientific fortresses in their learning posts.

May we all be such willing people!

### 困难最怕有心人

    困难最怕有心人
    “天下无难事，只怕有心人。”这两句话，几乎人人皆知。但是，“无难事”要有一个前提，那就是必须先有“有心人”。没有“有心人”，难事总归还是难事。因此，这个“心”字，大有文章。
    什么心？首先是克服困难的决心。如果缺乏战胜困难的勇气，困难非但会永远存在，甚至小难会化为大难。“困难像弹簧，看你强不强；你强它就弱，你弱它就强。”这就是群众给困难下的结论！
    和困难打交道，光有决心还不行，还必须细心。每一个困难，都有每一个困难的脾气。不摸透它的脾气，蛮冲猛闯，也免不了要碰钉子。这个脾气，就是我们通常所说的客观规律。对于客观规律，只有细心研究，认真对待，才能利用它，不断胜利，不断前进！
    决心和细心，就是我们所说的“有心人”。王保京，高玉宝，谭海泉，就是这种“有心人”。他们凭着这颗心，过去，在生产中，在战场上赢得了胜利；今天，又在学习岗位上，攻克了科学堡垒。
    愿我们大家都做这种有心人！
