Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 28th: The Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Prosperity People's Commune in Longjiang County, Heilongjiang Province, has adopted the method of "following production" to carry out purchasing and sales activities, which has achieved good results in promoting production, facilitating commune members, and completing purchasing and sales plans.

During this year's crop threshing season, the branch's salesmen drove ox carts or carried goods on shoulder poles to deliver cold-weather supplies and threshing tools to the Prosperity Management Area's courtyards. During threshing breaks, the salesmen set out the goods for the commune members to choose from. For products that commune members wanted to sell from their homes, the salesmen also arranged times to visit and collect the goods. Commune members were able to buy satisfactory items and sell their agricultural and sideline products in the courtyards.

During this year's spring plowing, summer hoeing, minor summer harvest, and minor autumn harvest, the salesmen often went to the fields, canteens, and mountain production sites to organize noon and evening markets. Commune members could buy and sell during meal times and breaks, saving travel time. According to incomplete statistics, this commune saved more than 20,000 workdays this year as a result.

This new approach has also promoted the completion of purchasing plans. This year, the commune's supply and marketing cooperative completed its purchasing plan one hundred days ahead of schedule, and the sales plan was also completed very well.

    深入田头场院送工业品
    约定时间登门购副产品
    龙江县繁荣公社供销部购销活动随着生产转
    据新华社哈尔滨28日电  黑龙江省龙江县繁荣人民公社供销部采取“随着生产转”的方法开展购销活动，对促进生产、方便社员、完成购销计划，都收到良好效果。
    在今年的农作物脱谷季节，分销部的营业员们就赶着牛车或者挑着货挑，把防寒用品和打场工具送到繁荣管理区场院。在打场休息的时候，营业员把货物摆出来，供社员选购。对社员家里要出售的产品，营业员也同他们约定时间登门取货。社员们在场院里买到了可心的东西，出售了农副产品。
    在今年的春耕、夏锄、小夏收和小秋收中，营业员经常到田间、食堂、山上生产场所组织午市、晚市，社员们借吃饭、休息时间就可进行买卖，省去了跑路时间。据不完全统计，这个公社今年因此节省了二万多个劳动日。
    这种新的做法，还促进了收购计划的完成。今年这个公社供销部提前一百天完成了收购计划，销售计划也完成得很好。
