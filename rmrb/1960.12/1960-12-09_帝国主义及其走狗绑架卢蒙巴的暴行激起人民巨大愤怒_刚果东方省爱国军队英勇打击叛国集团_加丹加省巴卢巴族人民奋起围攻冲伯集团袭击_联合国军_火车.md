Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch: Leopoldville news: The imperialists and their running dogs, Mobutu's atrocities of kidnapping Prime Minister Lumumba, aroused great anger among the patriotic soldiers and civilians of Orientale Province, Congo. According to reports, the Congolese patriotic forces in Stanleyville, the capital of Orientale Province, entered the northern region of Equateur Province on the 5th to combat the forces of the Mobutu traitorous clique there.

The news said that the patriotic army engaged in battle with Mobutu's reactionary armed forces in Bemba, fifteen miles inside Equateur Province. The Mobutu group hurriedly dispatched reinforcements there.

The angry people of Stanleyville, in order to step up their fight against the colonialists' conspiracies to undermine Congolese independence, have sealed off the area to prevent colonialists from sneaking in to carry out activities.

At the same time, under the instigation of imperialism, the traitorous groups in the Congo are stepping up their collusion, conspiring to replace the legitimate government of Lumumba. According to Agence France-Presse, Mobutu's "Commission of Commissioners" and the illegal "government" of Ileo appointed by Kasavubu are holding secret talks, planning to form a "coalition government."

Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch: Elisabethville news: About one thousand armed Congolese Baluba people, disregarding the barbaric suppression of the "UN forces" and Tshombe's reactionary police, continued to besiege Luena, the coal mining center of Katanga Province, where the Tshombe traitorous group is entrenched, on the 3rd.

Prior to this, about three thousand angry Baluba people launched an attack on Luena on the 2nd, and were subjected to armed suppression by the "UN forces" there. The "UN forces" even arrested two thousand Baluba patriots and disarmed them. However, the Baluba people were not intimidated by this atrocity of the "UN forces." The next day, about one thousand Baluba patriots continued to attack Luena. Western news agencies reported that Luena was still surrounded by the Baluba people.

On the evening of the 3rd, the Baluba people also attacked a "UN forces" train near Luena that was heading towards Elisabethville. The news said that the train was carrying fifty Baluba leaders who had been abducted by the "UN forces" in Luena. According to Western news agencies, the "UN forces" intended to hand them over to the Tshombe authorities in Elisabethville.

The news said that near Kabalo in northern Katanga Province, a large number of Baluba people are gathering, preparing to launch an attack on the city to strike at the Tshombe reactionary armed forces who are staying in the city. However, according to Agence France-Presse, Berendson, the UN representative in Katanga Province, and Byrne, the commander of the "UN forces" there, rushed from Elisabethville to Kabalo on the 4th to plan new interventions and suppression. At the same time, amid the imperialists' intensified use of various means to undermine Congolese independence and unity, the traitor Tshombe has gone to Brussels on the 4th to carry out activities.

    加丹加省巴卢巴族人民奋起围攻冲伯集团袭击“联合国军”火车
    新华社7日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：帝国主义及其走狗蒙博托绑架卢蒙巴总理的暴行，激起了刚果东方省爱国军民的巨大愤怒。据报道，东方省省会斯坦利维尔的刚果爱国军队已经在5日进入赤道省北部地区，打击蒙博托叛国集团在那里的势力。
    消息说，爱国军队在赤道省境内十五英里的奔巴地方同蒙博托的反动武装展开了战斗。蒙博托集团急忙向那里增派援军。
    愤怒的斯坦利维尔人民为了加紧打击殖民者破坏刚果独立的阴谋活动，已经封锁了那个地区，防止殖民者潜入活动。
    和这同时，在帝国主义策动下，刚果的叛国集团之间正在加紧勾结，阴谋取代卢蒙巴合法政府的地位。据法新社报道，蒙博托的“专员委员会”和卡萨武布任命的伊利奥非法“政府”正在进行密谈，策划成立一个“联合政府”。
    新华社5日讯　伊利沙伯维尔消息：约一千名刚果巴卢巴族人民武装，不顾“联合国军”和冲伯反动警察的野蛮镇压，3日继续围攻冲伯卖国集团盘踞的加丹加省煤矿中心卢埃纳。
    在这以前，约三千名愤怒的巴卢巴族人2日向卢埃纳发动攻击，遭到那里“联合国军”的武装镇压。“联合国军”竟逮捕了二千名巴卢巴爱国者，并解除他们的武装。但是，巴卢巴族并没有被“联合国军”的这种暴行所吓倒，第二天，约一千名巴卢巴爱国者又继续向卢埃纳发起进攻。西方通讯社报道，卢埃纳仍处在巴卢巴人的包围之中。
    3日晚上，巴卢巴族人还在卢埃纳附近袭击了“联合国军”的一列正开向伊利沙伯维尔的火车。消息说，这列火车上押有在卢埃纳被“联合国军”劫持的五十名巴卢巴族人的领袖。据西方通讯社透露，“联合国军”打算把他们交给伊利沙伯维尔的冲伯当局。
    消息说，在加丹加省北部的卡巴洛附近，巴卢巴人大量在集结，准备向这个城市发动进攻，打击赖在城里不走的冲伯反动武装。但是据法新社报道，联合国在加丹加省的代表贝伦德森和在那里的“联合国军”司令伯恩4日赶忙从伊利沙伯维尔去卡巴洛，策划新的干涉和镇压。同时，在帝国主义者加紧用各种手段破坏刚果独立和统一声中，叛国分子冲伯已在4日前往布鲁塞尔活动。
