Public and Private Efforts Combined, Raise Pigs in a Big Way
	Caimen Brigade Implements Pig Raising Policy, Average Pig Ownership Increases from 1.5 to 4.5 per Household
	Dili Brigade Corrects Shortcomings in Two Years of Pig Raising Work, Number of Pigs Gradually Increases
	This newspaper reports: In the development of pig production, the Caimen Brigade of the Zhongnan Commune and the Dili Brigade of the Chengguan Commune (both are basic accounting units) in Huanjiang County, Guangxi, adopted two different attitudes in implementing the policy of combining public and private pig raising. The pig production formed a clear contrast. Compared with 1958, the Caimen Brigade of Zhongnan Commune increased from 1.5 pigs per household to 4.5 pigs per household. The number of pigs in the Dili Brigade of Chengguan Commune not only did not develop, but declined.
	For the past two years, the Caimen Brigade of Zhongnan Commune has adhered to the pig raising policy of "walking on two legs." Currently, this brigade has 561 pigs, with an average of 4.5 pigs per household for 122 members. Among them, the number of publicly raised pigs has increased from 175 to 403, and the number of privately raised pigs has increased from 4 to 158.
	As early as 1956, after the Caimen Brigade was transformed into an advanced cooperative, the 233 pigs privately raised by the members were valued and put into the cooperative. However, due to the lack of experience in centralized feeding, some died, so the pigs were handed back to the members for raising. Would it work to have the members raise the pigs entirely by themselves? At that time, the members castrated 23 of the 25 sows given to them (because raising meat pigs saves effort). After a year of raising, the number increased from 151 to 179, but this was too slow, only an increase of 28. In 1958, based on the desire for accelerated development, the brigade implemented collective breeding again. Because collective pig raising was more experienced, the pigs were fatter than in 1956, and there were fewer sick pigs. However, after deducting eating and selling, the number of pigs at the end of the year did not increase significantly.
	After learning the lessons of three years, people realized that a new path must be found to develop the pig raising industry at high speed. Just then, the Party put forward the policy of combining public and private raising, and the members were greatly encouraged. After the brigade cadres handed this policy and typical experiences to the masses for extensive discussion, everyone immediately agreed.
	After the policy of high-speed development of pig raising by walking on two legs of public and private raising was put forward, a prominent problem was the source of pigs. At that time, there were only two sows in the entire brigade. How could the members solve the problem of raising pigs? The brigade Party branch proposed: resolutely implement the Party's instructions, implement the policy of self-breeding, adopt the method of keeping all sows, selecting later, raising sows and boars collectively, and supporting members with piglets. In order to raise these two sows well, they promoted the "four fixings" contracting system of fixed output, fixed investment, fixed work points, and fixed rewards and punishments to improve the enthusiasm and responsibility of the breeders, improve the sow's litter rate, and reduce and avoid empty pregnancies. Sure enough, by April, the two sows had produced 27 piglets, including 18 gilts. Later, due to strengthening the feeding of sows, promoting the advanced experience of artificial insemination, and carrying out the "all pregnant, all born, all alive" campaign, 20 sows produced another 164 piglets, including 87 gilts. In this way, the problem of the source of pigs for collective and individual pig raising was gradually solved.
	Having a source of pigs, it is also necessary to solve the problem of feed. Should we rely on ourselves to solve it, or rely on the state to solve it? Should we walk on one leg, or walk on two legs? At that time, many members believed that "only by supplying fine feed from the state can we raise big fat pigs." Of course, some fine feed is necessary, but we must not ignore the members' original experience of using coarse feed to raise pigs fat and strong. Therefore, the team collected a large amount of wild feed. This year, they collected more than 50,000 catties of more than 150 kinds of wild feed such as wild buckwheat and sand bark. Because the members' private plots grew some feed, and the brigade established a collective feed base of 120 mu, the feed problem was solved, and the enthusiasm of the members to raise pigs was unprecedentedly high.
	Solving the problems of pig sources and feed, it is also necessary to ensure labor and time to raise pigs well. Originally, some team cadres were worried: would the members raising pigs affect their work attendance? Would they not listen to orders? The members were also worried that they would not have time and would not be able to raise pigs well. The brigade took four measures to solve these problems: First, implement a combination of work and rest, with a holiday every ten days, so that members can use the holidays to plant and take care of feed crops in their private plots; second, implement a labor quota and reward and punishment system; third, in arranging work attendance, work completion, rest, and meal times, members must be able to arrange their own work well; fourth, neighbors help each other. Some members' families do not have additional labor, and the attached labor at home helps to feed the pigs during the day, and the private individuals pay a certain remuneration. In this way, the contradiction between private pig raising and doing a good job in collective production was resolved, and the members were more active in work attendance. Of the 264 laborers in the entire brigade, 123 people attended work for more than 330 days a year, 89 people attended work for 320 days, and the rest attended work for more than 300 days.
	For the past two years, the cadres of the Caimen Brigade have deeply realized that to develop the pig raising industry at high speed, policy implementation is a huge driving force. They said: "We must do what we say, and the enthusiasm of the members to raise pigs will be improved." Indeed, they have implemented policies in developing the pig raising industry for the past two years. For example, they have always implemented the six-fixing contracting system of fixing the number of heads, fixing the weight gain, fixing work points, fixing feed, fixing fertilizer, and fixing rewards and punishments.
	The Caimen Brigade used to be a very poor brigade, with only 722 mu of land, surrounded by stone mountains, with steep slopes and much soil erosion. In addition, there were no plowing cattle and few pigs, insufficient fertilizer, poor soil quality, and very low crop yields. Before 1958, the entire brigade had to sell 200,000 catties of grain every year. In 1959 and 1960, after the large-scale development of pigs, there was more pig manure, and this year there was an average of 41 dan of pig manure per mu of land. Due to more fertilizer, plus other measures to increase production, grain production in 1960 increased by 22% compared with 1959. The pig purchase task was 66 heads, and 178 heads have already been completed.
	The brigade is now continuing to implement the policy of "walking on two legs" to push the pig raising industry to a higher peak. All 54 sows in the brigade will be giving birth to piglets within a month, and it is expected to produce more than 400 piglets. In this way, by the end of this year, it will be possible to reach more than one pig per mu of land.
	What is the situation of the Caimen Brigade like? What about the situation of the Dili Brigade?
	For the past two years, the Dili Brigade of Chengguan Commune has never implemented the policy of "walking on two legs," but has been hopping around on one leg. Before 1958, the brigade had a total of 323 pigs, with an average of 2.9 pigs per household for 110 members, including 111 publicly raised pigs and 212 pigs raised by members. Originally, both publicly and privately raised pigs were raised fat and strong. In particular, collective pig raising was successful. Relying on self-breeding and careful management, 111 pigs grew very lovely. However, some cadres felt that it was better to have them raised entirely collectively, so they mobilized the members to evaluate the pigs and put them into the cooperative. Because the breeders were temporarily transferred, the pigs were not well managed, the big pigs bit the small pigs, and the feed problem was not solved well. Mainly relying on the little fine feed given by the state, only 36 heads were left after a year of raising.
	Seeing this, the brigade cadres did not study how to raise the collective pigs well and combine public and private efforts, but simply adopted the method of handing them all over to the members, and stipulated that the weight gain would be divided into four-six, with 40% going to the brigade and 60% going to the members. Because the feed, labor, and time were not arranged, especially without firmly implementing the policy, the members' thoughts were uncertain, and the pigs were not fed well, so several more died. After a year of raising by the members, only 32 pigs were left out of 36 in December 1959.
	Then the cadres became anxious again. In a hurry, they adopted the method of centralized feeding again. In this way, from 1958 to 1960, they sometimes concentrated feeding and sometimes dispersed feeding. In addition, due to other reasons, there were only six pigs in the entire brigade in June of this year. With few pigs and little fertilizer, coupled with other reasons, the brigade's grain production was also seriously affected.
	In June, in accordance with the instructions of the Prefectural Committee, the County Committee organized a work team to help the brigade rearrange the pig raising work. The existing pigs were handed over to the canteen for raising, carefully managed, and the sows were raised well. Recently, one sow has given birth to piglets. On the basis of implementing policies and mobilizing the masses, we will conscientiously implement the policy of "walking on two legs" and "collective pig raising is mainly based on small teams and canteens." The "three fulfillments" were realized: all those who raise pigs, including pigs, feed grain, and feed land, are all implemented together. As a result, the enthusiasm of the masses has risen again, and they are vying to raise pigs.

    公私并举　大养其猪
    才门大队贯彻养猪方针平均每户养猪由一头半增到四头半
    地理大队改正两年来养猪工作的缺点猪只头数逐渐增加
    本报讯　广西环江县中南公社才门大队和城关公社地理大队（都是基本核算单位）在发展养猪生产上，由于执行公私并举养猪方针采取了两种不同的态度，养猪生产形成了鲜明的对照，今年和1958年比较，中南公社才门大队从每户有猪一头半增长到四头半，城关公社地理大队的猪不但没有发展，反而下降了。
    中南公社的才门大队，两年来坚持执行两条腿走路的养猪方针。现在，这个大队有猪五百六十一头，一百二十二户社员平均每户有猪四头半，其中公养由一百七十五头增加到四百零三头，私养由四头增加到一百五十八头。
    远在1956年，才门大队转入高级社后，社员私养的二百三十三头猪曾经评价入社。但是，由于缺乏集中喂养的经验，死了一些，因此又把猪交给社员养。完全由社员养猪行不行呢？当时，交给社员养的二十五头母猪，社员们就阉了二十三头（因为养肉猪省工夫）。养了一年，由一百五十一头增加到了一百七十九头，但是，太缓慢了，只增加了二十八头。1958年，基于加快发展的愿望，这个大队又实行集体饲养。由于集体养猪比较有经验了，猪养得比1956年肥了一些，病猪也比较少一些，但是，除去吃和卖，年底存栏数还是没有很大的发展。
    吸取了三年的教训，人们认识到，要把养猪业高速度发展起来，必须另找新路。正在这时，党提出了公养和私养并举的方针，社员们受到了极大的鼓舞，大队干部把这一方针和典型经验交给群众广泛讨论后，大家立刻一致赞同。
    公养、私养两条腿走路的高速度发展养猪的方针提出来以后，一个突出的问题是猪源问题。那时全大队只有两条母猪，社员养猪怎么解决？大队党支部提出：坚决贯彻党的指示，实行自养自繁的方针，采取逢母必留，先留后选，集体养母猪、公猪，用猪仔支援社员的办法。为了把这两头母猪养好，推行定产量、定投资、定工分、定奖惩的“四定”包工，以提高饲养员的积极性和责任感，提高母猪生仔率，减少和避免空怀。果然，到4月份，两头母猪就养出小猪二十七头，其中小母猪十八头。以后，由于对母猪加强饲养，推广人工配种的先进经验，开展“全怀、全生、全活”运动，二十头母猪又养出小猪一百六十四头，其中小母猪八十七头。这样，集体养猪和个人养猪的猪源问题就逐步地得到了解决。
    有了猪源，还要解决饲料问题。是依靠自己解决，还是依赖国家解决？是一条腿走路，还是两条腿走路？当时，许多社员认为，“全由国家供给精饲料，才能养大肥猪”。当然，精饲料是要有一些，但绝不能忽视社员们原有的用粗饲料把猪养肥养壮的经验。因此这个队大量采集野生饲料，今年即采集野荞麦、沙树皮等一百五十多种野生饲料共五万多斤。由于社员自留地种了一部分饲料，大队又建立了集体饲料基地一百二十亩，解决了饲料问题，社员养猪的积极性空前高涨。
    解决了猪源和饲料问题，还必须在劳力和时间上给以保证才能把猪养好。原来有些小队干部担心：社员养猪会不会影响出工？会不会不听指挥？社员们原先也顾虑没有时间，猪养不好。这个大队在解决这些问题时采取了四条措施：一是贯彻劳逸结合，十天放一次假，社员可用假日来种植和护理自留地的饲料作物；二是实行劳动定额和奖惩制度；三是在安排出工、收工、休息和开饭的时间上，要使社员能够安排好自家活路；四是邻里相帮，有些社员家里没有附带劳动力的，白天由邻居在家的附带劳力帮助喂猪，由私人付给一定报酬。这样，就解决了私人养猪与搞好集体生产的矛盾，社员出工更加积极。全大队劳力二百六十四个，一年来出工达三百三十天以上的有一百二十三人，三百二十天的有八十九人，其余的都出工三百天以上。
    才门大队的干部，两年来深深地体会到：要使养猪业高速度发展，政策落实是一个巨大的动力。他们说：“一定要做到讲到哪里，做到哪里，社员养猪的积极性才会提高。”确实，他们两年来发展养猪事业，都贯彻执行了政策。如定头数、定长膘、定工分、定饲料、定肥料、定奖惩的六定包工，他们自始至终贯彻到底。
    才门大队过去是一个很穷的大队，只有土地七百二十二亩，四面是石山，坡度大，水土流失多，加上没有耕牛，猪又少，肥料不足，土质贫瘠，作物产量很低。1958年以前，每年全大队要统销二十万斤粮食。1959和1960两年，生猪大发展后，猪粪多，今年平均每亩地有猪粪四十一担。由于肥料多，加上其他增产措施，1960年粮食比1959年增产22％。生猪派购任务六十六头，已经完成了一百七十八头。
    这个大队现在正继续执行两条腿走路的方针，把养猪事业推向更高的高峰。全大队五十四头母猪在一个月内又要生猪仔了，预计可产猪仔四百头以上。这样，到今年年底，就可以达到每亩地一头多猪了。
    才门大队的情况如此，地理大队的情况如何呢？
    两年来，城关公社地理大队始终没有执行“两条腿走路”的方针，而是一条腿跳来跳去。1958年以前，这个大队共有猪三百二十三头，一百一十户社员平均每户两头九，其中公养一百一十一头，社员养二百一十二头。本来公养私养的猪，都养得肥肥胖胖。特别是集体养猪有成绩，靠着自养自繁，精心管理，一百一十一头猪长得真爱煞人。可是，有的干部觉得完全由集体养更好，于是就动员社员把猪评价入社。因为饲养员是一时调来的，猪管不好，大猪咬小猪，再加上饲料问题没解决好，主要靠国家规定给的那点精饲料，养了一年，就只剩下三十六头。
    大队干部们见此，不是研究如何既能把集体的猪养好，又能公私并举，而是简单地采取了全部交给社员的办法，并规定增膘四六分红，四成归大队，六成归社员。由于饲料、劳力、时间未作安排，特别是没有坚定地贯彻政策，社员们思想不定，猪就喂不好，所以又死了几头。社员养了一年，到1959年12月，三十六头猪只剩下三十二头。
    于是干部们又着急了，一急之下，又采取集中饲养的方法。就是这样，从1958年到1960年时而集中饲养，时而分散饲养，加上其他原因，到今年6月，全大队总共还有六头猪。猪少肥少，加上其他原因，这个大队的粮食生产也受到了严重的影响。
    6月份遵照地委指示，县委组织了工作组，帮助这个大队把养猪工作重新做了安排。把现有的猪交给食堂去养，精心管理，养好母猪。最近一条母猪已经生仔。在贯彻政策、发动群众的基础上，认真执行“两条腿走路”和“集体养猪以小队和食堂为主”的方针。实现了“三兑现”：凡养猪的，连猪带饲料粮，再加上饲料地，一起落实。这一来，群众情绪又高涨起来，争着要养猪了。
