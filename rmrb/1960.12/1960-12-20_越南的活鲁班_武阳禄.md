    "Vietnam's Living Lu Ban" - Vuong Duong Luc
    Feng Jianwei
    Seventy-one-year-old carpenter Vuong Duong Luc has been consecutively elected as a national model worker in Vietnam's construction industry for four years. This year, he was honorably approved to join the Vietnamese Labor Party.
    Vuong Duong Luc is from Tan Trieu commune, Thanh Tri district, Ha Dong province. He was born into a poor peasant family, learned carpentry at the age of twelve, and became a craftsman at seventeen. For more than fifty years before liberation, he traveled throughout the towns and villages of northern Vietnam with an axe and a saw, repairing villas for local tyrants and landlords, and building bungalows for the French. However, he still lived in the open air, enduring all the hardships of the world, and was even injured in the right arm by French colonists. He hated imperialism, secretly participated in the anti-war work, hid documents for the Party, escorted cadres, and delivered food and grain to the People's Army. Later, he ran to the liberated areas, thus ending his old life and beginning a new one.
    This old carpenter, known as "Vietnam's Living Lu Ban," is an experienced and skilled craftsman. Although he is old and not in good health, he has always been active and diligent in his work, never absent, and always maintains his old habit: he cannot be idle. Last winter, he was transferred to the expansion site of the Haiphong Cement Plant. Without work assigned for a while, he asked the leaders for work every day.
    The leading cadres said to him: "Old Vuong, we are even more anxious than you. Seeing large batches of workers being transferred here, but there is no dormitory to live in!"
    "Build them quickly."
    "There is no wood!"
    "Build bamboo ones."
    "That's right, build bamboo ones." The leadership approved it. So, Old Vuong went from being a carpenter to a bamboo craftsman, and built bamboo sheds with his fellow workers. Spacious and bright bamboo houses were quickly built. When the newly arrived workers moved into their new homes, they all smiled at Old Vuong, expressing their infinite gratitude.
    Vuong Duong Luc not only has proficient carpentry skills, but is also happy to impart his skills and actively help others. When building workers' residences in Hanoi, it took others three days to make a staircase, but he only needed two. He traveled around the construction site introducing this experience, and more than two hundred carpenters learned from him. In recent years, the apprentices he has directly and indirectly trained have been spread throughout the construction sites of northern Vietnam, and all of them are masters.
    Through the long and painful experiences of the old society, Vuong Duong Luc has strong class feelings. He loves his work and the country's construction cause even more, and consciously contributes everything he has to this cause.
    In the early days of liberation, an old friend of Vuong Duong Luc said to him: "With your father and son's good craftsmanship, you can earn a good salary anywhere. Why participate in the construction site and earn less money!"
    Vuong Duong Luc immediately said to him after hearing these words: "If you are my good friend, you should say good things and persuade me to do good deeds. How can you lead me astray?"
    Vuong Duong Luc then asked this friend: Others don't understand, haven't you seen the consequences of my working alone for more than fifty years?
    His friend had to admit that Vuong Duong Luc was right.
    Vuong Duong Luc took his four sons and resolutely joined the state-owned construction company shortly after the restoration of peace in northern Vietnam. From the first day of working for the public, Vuong Duong Luc has always been diligent and hardworking, leaving the heavy work to himself and the light work to others. He is also thrifty and careful, cherishing every plant and tree of the public. In the past five years, he has used waste wood to make many appliances for the country.
    Vuong Duong Luc is not only a good worker, but also an active member on the construction site. This seventy-year-old man is indispensable in everything from morning exercises to evening parties, from political study to recreational activities. His spirit of diligently studying culture is very prominent. Five years ago, he was illiterate, but now he can read newspapers and write ordinary letters.
    Vuong Duong Luc's family life is also happy and pleasant. He passed on his rich experience to his four sons, so that they not only have proficient carpentry skills, but also a hardworking attitude, so they were all elected as national model workers in the construction industry. Vuong Duong Luc used his personal experience of the changes in life before and after liberation to educate his wife and four daughters-in-law, so that they have always actively taken the lead in various tasks in the township and made outstanding achievements. Every Spring Festival is a day for the whole family to reunite, and a family meeting is held at this time. At the meeting, each person reports on their work achievements and shortcomings of the year, conducts evaluations, and then puts forward plans for the next year, challenging and competing with each other. This type of meeting is held once a year, and has been maintained for four or five years without interruption, so that the whole family has developed a good relationship of mutual care and mutual help.

    “越南的活鲁班”——武阳禄
    冯建伟
    七十一岁的老木工武阳禄，曾连续四年当选为越南全国建筑工业劳动模范。今年，他又光荣地被批准加入越南劳动党。
    武阳禄是河东省清池县新潮乡人。他出生在一个贫农家庭，十二岁学木工，十七岁当匠人。解放前五十多年中，他一把斧头一张锯，走遍越南北方的城镇和乡村，给土豪地主修过别墅，给法国人盖过洋房，而自己依然餐风宿雨，受尽人间的苦楚，还被法国殖民者打伤了右臂。他仇恨帝国主义，秘密参加了抗战工作，为党藏文件，护送干部，给人民军送饭运粮。后来他跑到解放区，从此结束了旧生活，开始了新生活。
    这位被称为“越南的活鲁班”的老木工，是一位经验丰富、技术娴熟的能工巧匠。虽然他的年纪大了，身体也不大好，但在工作中却一贯积极肯干，手脚勤快，从不缺勤，而且总保持着他的老习惯：不能闲着。去年冬天，他被调到海防市水泥厂扩建工地，一时没有分配工作，他天天找领导要活干。
    领导干部对他说：“老武呀，我们比你还着急哩，眼见大批大批工人调来了，却没有宿舍住！”
    “赶快盖吧。”
    “没有木料！”
    “盖竹子的。”
    “对，盖竹子的。”领导上批准了。于是，老武就由木工变竹匠，和工友们一起修建竹棚。一幢幢宽敞明亮的竹房迅速地建成了，当新来的工人弟兄搬进新居时，都对着老武笑笑，表示无限感激。
    武阳禄不仅有熟练的木工技术，而且还乐于传授技术，积极帮助别人。在河内市修建工人住宅时，别人作楼梯要三天，他只用两天。他走遍工地介绍这个经验，有两百多木工跟他学。近几年来，他直接和间接培养的徒弟，遍布越南北方的建筑工地，而且个个都是好手。
    经过旧社会漫长的痛苦遭遇，武阳禄有强烈的阶级情感。他热爱自己的工作，更热爱国家的建筑事业，并且自觉地为这一事业贡献自己的一切。
    还在解放初期，武阳禄的一位老朋友对他说：“凭你们父子的这份好手艺，到哪里不挣头份工钱，干嘛要参加建筑工地少挣钱呀！”
    武阳禄听了这些话立即对他说：“是我的好朋友，就该说好话，劝我作好事，怎么让我走邪路呢？”
    武阳禄接着又问这位朋友：别人不了解，难道你没有看见我单干五十多年的下场吗？
    他的朋友不得不承认，是武阳禄作对了。
    武阳禄带着四个儿子在越南北方恢复和平建设不久就毅然参加了国营建筑公司。从给公家干活的第一天起，武阳禄总是勤勤恳恳，吃苦耐劳，把重活留给自己，把轻活让给别人。他还勤俭节约，爱惜公家的一草一木。五年来，他利用废木料为国家作了很多器具。
    武阳禄不仅是劳动好手，而且还是工地上的活跃分子。这位七十高龄的老人，从早操到晚会，从政治学习到文娱活动，样样都少不了他。他刻苦钻研文化的精神是很突出的。五年前，他目不识丁，现在已经能读报，可以写普通的信件。
    武阳禄的家庭生活也是幸福和愉快的。他把自己的丰富经验传授给四个儿子，使他们既有熟练的木工技术，又有埋头苦干的劳动态度，因而都当选为全国建筑工业劳动模范。武阳禄以解放前后生活变化的亲身经历，教育老伴和四个儿媳妇，使她们在乡里的各项工作中，一贯积极带头，作出了突出的成绩。每年春节，是全家大团圆的日子，这时就召开家庭会议。会上，每人汇报一年的工作成绩和缺点，开展评比，然后提出下年度的计划，互相挑战竞赛。这种会议每年一次，保持四、五年没有间断，使全家都养成一种互相关怀和互相帮助的良好关系。（附图片）
