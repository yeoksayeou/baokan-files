    Consulting with Everyone on Work Matters
    He Xiaozhang, Foreman of the Mud Mixing Team, Raw Materials Workshop, Kungang Iron and Steel Plant

    In the past, I didn't consult enough with the comrades in my team. Whenever there was a difficulty, I would just go to the leaders. When assigning tasks to the team members, I simplified things. As a result, the tasks were not completed well. I was anxious, and everyone had complaints about me. I thought being a team leader was really difficult.

    Unable to solve the problem, I was very distressed. Later, I listened to the experiences of advanced teams, and they all emphasized that listening to the Party and consulting with the masses were most important. The Party committee report also emphasized this point. Later, I also read Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and finally understood a principle: it's not enough to just give orders; you also have to raise everyone's awareness. My problem was that my methods were too simple; I only talked about doing things, but I didn't explain why we were doing them. So, I decided to hold a team meeting and take the lead in criticizing my own shortcomings. At the same time, I also told everyone why I was anxious: "The blast furnace roars and spits fire as soon as the iron is tapped. If we don't complete the task of producing refractory mud, how can we seal the furnace door without refractory mud?" As soon as I opened up, everyone spoke their minds, raised their opinions about me, and boldly exposed their thoughts. Our relationship became much warmer. In the thoughts that everyone exposed, some always felt that no matter how hard they tried, they couldn't meet my demands, as if they were working for me. So, we addressed this problem by getting to the root of it and initiated a discussion. If the people in the team are working for the team leader, then who is the team leader working for? Who is the factory director working for? This inquiry clarified the issue: it turned out that we were all working for socialism. Addressing the idea that some people felt "there's no future in making mud in the mud mixing team," we compared our team to a kitchen, making refractory mud to cooking food, and the blast furnace to a person. The discussion resulted in unanimous agreement that a person cannot be fed without a kitchen, and the blast furnace cannot have refractory mud without the mud mixing team. We recognized the importance of our work, and those who were unsettled became settled. With unified thought, our enthusiasm doubled. I also deeply realized that we must listen to the Party, consult with the masses more, and things will be much easier to handle. Later, the demand for refractory mud increased, and our production was not enough. We needed to produce more and also create some reserves in case of emergencies. What to do? I consulted with everyone again. Originally, I only thought about mobilizing everyone to work a little harder and endure a little more hardship. After consulting with everyone, some suggested storing more coke powder and white clay first to prevent difficulties on rainy days; some suggested changing from people pulling the grinding roller to oxen pulling it to improve efficiency; some said it would be best to use a tractor to pull the grinding roller, which would be more efficient than human or oxen power. There were many thoughtful suggestions. So, we started a technical innovation campaign. Everyone gathered materials and worked on their own. We were not discouraged by several failures. As a result, we created an electric mud grinding machine. It not only had high efficiency and good quality but also saved manpower.

    Due to the vigorous technical innovation campaign, the whole team freed up manpower, and the tasks were completed better than in the past. With the strengthening of the Party committee's leadership over the team's work, we also established seven positions in our team, including safety and quality inspector, material supplier, tool manager, and propaganda mobilizer. Everything was managed by a dedicated person, which further enhanced everyone's enthusiasm. For example, in the past, we needed to get four or five shovels a month. After we had a tool manager, seven shovels have been used from June until now. All comrades in the team also care about each other very much. They not only care about life but also especially care about political progress. For example, when team member Yang Cunhou was sick, everyone fed him food and medicine. When he recovered, he said with emotion, "You are all too good to me." We told him, "Mainly because the Party's leadership is good and the socialist system is good." This improved his awareness. He quickly transformed from someone who didn't care about production and learning into an active member and important backbone of the team. All the team members are truly as close as family, competing to do heavy work, and helping each other solve difficulties in life. Therefore, when some comrades leave the team to be transferred to other teams, they are always reluctant to leave.

    和大家商量办事
    昆钢炼铁厂原料车间和泥组组长　何小章
    以前，我和小组的同志商量不够，一有困难就找领导，在向组员布置任务的时候，简单化，结果，任务完成得不好，我干着急，大家还对我有意见。我就想小组长实在不好当。
    问题解决不了，我心里很苦恼。后来，我听先进组介绍经验，都讲听党的话，和群众商量最重要，党委报告也强调这一条。以后，又读了毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，终于懂得了一条道理，光靠下命令是不行的，还要提高大家的觉悟。我的毛病就是办法太简单，只讲干，没讲清为什么要干。于是，我决心开个小组会，自己先带头检讨了缺点。同时，也把我为什么着急告诉了大家：“高炉一出完铁就吼吼地喷火，如果我们生产的耐火泥完不成任务，没耐火泥封炉门怎得了？”我一交底，大家就都说出了知心话，对我的意见也都提出来了，还大胆地暴露了思想，彼此关系就亲热起来了。在大家暴露的思想中，有的总觉得再努力也满足不了我的要求，就好像给我干活一样。于是，我们就针对这个问题，采取追根问到底的办法，展开了讨论。如果小组里的人是给组长干，那末组长又给谁干呢？厂长给谁干呢？这一追问题就明白了，原来，我们大家都在为社会主义干。又针对有人认为“在和泥组搞泥巴，没前途”的思想，把我们小组比作厨房，把搞耐火泥比为做饭，把高炉比做人来进行讨论。讨论结果一致认为没有厨房给人做饭不行，没有和泥组给高炉搞耐火泥也不行，认识了我们工作的重要性，不安心的也安心了。思想统一，干劲倍增。我也深深体会到要听党的话，多和群众商量，一商量事情就好办得多。后来，耐火泥的需要量增加了，我们生产的不够用，要多生产些，还要搞点储备，以防万一。怎么办？我又和大家商量。原来我只想到动员大家多干一点，多辛苦一点。和大家一商量，有的说要先多储藏些焦末、白泥，防备下雨天不好搞；有的建议把人拉碾子改成牛拉，提高工效；有的说最好用牵引机拉碾子，比人拉、牛拉效率都高。办法又多又周到。于是，我们闹起了革新，大家自己搞材料，自己干，几次失败不灰心，结果搞成了电动碾泥机。不但工效高、质量好，还节省了人力。
    由于大闹革新，全组腾出了人力，任务还比过去完成得好。随着党委对小组工作领导的加强，我们组里又设立了安全质量检查员、材料供应员、工具管理员、宣传鼓动员等七大员，样样事情都有专人管，更加发挥了大家的积极性。比如，过去我们一个月要领四、五把洋铲。有了工具保管员后，七把洋铲从6月用到了现在。全组同志互相间也特别关心。不单关心生活，还特别关心政治上的进步。比如，组员杨存厚害病时，大家给他喂饭喂药。他病好了感动地说：“你们大家对我太好了。”我们告诉他说：“主要是党的领导好，社会主义制度好。”这就提高了他的觉悟。他很快就由过去不关心生产和学习，变成了小组的积极分子和重要骨干之一。全体组员真是亲如家人，互相争着做重活，生活上谁有困难也是大家帮助解决。所以，有的同志在离开小组调到别组的时候，总是依依不舍。
