    My Old Lady
    Xiao Guo, An Dong Printing Factory, Liaoning

    I never dreamed that my tongue-tied spouse could have a half-foot-tall photograph hanging on the honor roll in front of the city's Labor Palace; comrades all say I married a good wife. Me? Heh heh, I'm really both happy and a little ashamed.

    Two years ago, she was still a housewife who wouldn't get off the kang without the kids and her sewing kit, and when she was on the ground she was stuck at the stove. She couldn't speak well, and didn't want to, wearing her loose-fitting blue pants and dark jacket all year round, like a mute, just quietly dealing with pots and pans all day long. I often got mad at her over trivial things. I remember once, coming home from work late, I bought her a movie ticket at the factory, but she didn't say whether she would go or not, just busy setting the table and serving me food. After eating, I looked at the time and the movie was about to start, so I urged her to hurry up, and she said while washing the dishes, "If I can't make it, I won't go, I still have to hold the kids." When I heard that, my temper flared up again: "Don't go then!" I didn't understand her at all, and in two steps I was out of the house, slamming the door hard behind me, and went myself.

    After watching the movie and coming back, I saw her still mending my socks under the lamp. At this time, I couldn't help but blame myself for being too impatient.

    This spring, the street set up a canteen, and many people in the neighborhood stopped cooking at home and joined the canteen, and many housewives found jobs. She also discussed with me about joining the canteen, sending the two children to the nursery, and finding something to do herself. I agreed with her idea, and the next morning, she went to register, and the organization arranged a job for her. Who knew, everyone else was assigned to engage in civilian-run industry, but she was arranged to learn to shave in a barber shop. I was really not satisfied with this occupation of hers, but then I thought, since it was a unified arrangement by the organization, being too picky wouldn't be good, and besides, it was better than staying at home. So, she became a barber apprentice.

    From then on, like me, she went to work and came home early and late every day. Sometimes when she came back in the evening, she would ask me to coax the children, and she would put a dipper on the table, scraping it layer by layer with a razor, or she would roll up her thighs and practice shaving on them, which made me laugh. She often told me about what meetings they had, what competitions they were holding, and sometimes she would hum a few lines of song. I felt that she had changed, she had become generous, she had become cheerful.

    This summer, the whole city held a technical performance competition for the barber industry, soldier against soldier, general against general, and she was selected to attend. Hey, I didn't expect her to win first place, have her picture taken, and appear in the newspaper. Looking at the newspaper introducing her advanced deeds, I don't know why, my face was a little hot.

    This time, the Party Central Committee issued the great call to vigorously develop agriculture and vigorously develop grain, and I secretly vowed to walk ahead of her. So, I wrote applications one after another, asking to go to the countryside. Before the Party organization approved it, she brought back the approval the night before. She didn't tell me directly, and as soon as she entered the house and saw me burning the kang, she rushed up and told me to rest, and she would burn it herself. After adding a few pieces of firewood, she came over and turned on the radio. As soon as I heard the broadcast about transferring manpower to support agriculture, I immediately tried to get a read on her, and I said, "Hey, listen, people are going to the countryside to vigorously develop grain production, haven't you asked to go?" She smiled "Puchi" and said, "Don't ask me first, what about you?"

    "I, I wrote the application long ago!" I said very proudly.

    But unexpectedly, she took out the approved application and handed it to me, saying, "Comrade, take a look, we have already been approved!" When she said this, I saw her expression, and she really got the better of me again. So, we started calculating. In the end, we decided to move the family to the countryside. With the decision made, I took her approval letter and hurried to the factory to talk to Secretary Huang. When Secretary Huang heard this, he grabbed my hand and said, "Old Zhao, you two have chosen the right path, I represent the Party organization to formally approve you to go to the front line of agricultural production." I was so happy that I added another hand and tightly grasped Secretary Huang's tried and tested hand, unable to express a thousand words, and shed tears of excitement.

    俺那一口子
    辽宁安东印刷厂　萧郭
    我作梦也没想到俺那个笨嘴拙舌的人，能够在市劳动宫门前的光荣榜上挂上一张半尺多的大照片；同志们都说我娶了个好老婆。我呀，嘿嘿，真是又欢喜又有点羞愧。
    两年前，她还是个上炕不离孩子、线包，下地围着锅台的家庭妇女。不会说，也不愿道，一年四季穿着她那套肥大的青裤蓝褂，像个哑巴似的，一天到晚闷声闷气的，就知道跟锅碗瓢盆打交道。我常为一些鸡毛蒜皮的事儿跟她动火。记得有一次，晚上下班回来，我在厂里给她买了一张电影票，当时她也没说去还是不去，光顾着放桌子给我侍弄饭吃。吃完饭，我一看表快开映啦，就催她快点，她一边刷碗一边说：“不赶趟我就不去吧，还得抱着孩子哩。”我一听，火又上来了：“不去拉倒！”我一点儿不体谅她，两步迈出屋子，把门使劲往后一摔，自己去了。
    看完电影回来，我看她还在灯下给我补袜子。这时，我又不能不责备自己太暴躁了。
    今年春天，街道办了食堂，左右邻舍许多人都停锅离灶加入了食堂，不少家庭妇女找到了职业。她也和我商量要加入食堂，把两个孩子送到托儿所，自己也找点营生做。我同意了她的意见，第二天一早，她就去登记，组织上给她安排了工作。哪知道，人家都被分配去搞民办工业，她却被安排到理发馆里学剃头。我真不满意她这个职业，可是又一想，既然是组织上统一安排的，过分的挑剔也不太好，再说，总比在家呆着强。就这样，她就当上一名理发学徒了。
    打这一来，跟我一样，她每天早起晚归上下班。有时晚间回来，还叫我哄着孩子，自己把个水瓢扣在桌子上，用剃刀一层一层地刮，再不就把自己的大腿撸出来练习着刮，我看着都发笑。她还时常告诉我，他们又开什么会，又搞什么竞赛，有时还哼哼两句歌曲。我觉得她变了，变得大方了，变得开朗了。
    就在今年夏天，全市区举行理发行业兵对兵、将对将的技术表演赛，她被选拔出席了。嘿，真没想到还闹了个第一名，拍上了照片，登了报。我看着报上介绍她的那些先进事迹，不知怎的，我的脸有些发烧。
    这回，党中央发出大办农业、大办粮食的伟大号召，我就暗暗地发誓要走在她的前头。于是我便接二连三地写了申请，要求到农村去。还没等党组织批准，头天晚上人家又先把批准书拿回来了。她没直接告诉我，一进家门看我在那烧炕，就抢上来叫我歇着，自己来烧。添了几根柴禾，她就走过来把电匣子打开了。我一听到广播有关抽调人力支援农业的事，就先套上她的口气了，我说：“哎，你听，人家都下到农村大办粮食去啦，你没要求去吗？”她“噗哧”一笑说：“你先别问我，你呢？”
    “我呀，早就写申请啦！”我说得非常神气。
    可没有想到，她把批准的申请书掏出来，递给我说：“同志，看看吧，我们已经批下来啦！”说这话的时候，我看她那神气，真又压了我一头。于是，俺俩就核算开了。末了决定把家搬到乡下。主意已定，我便拿着她这张批准书，急忙来到厂里找黄书记谈了一遍。黄书记一听，便一把拉起我的手说：“老赵，你们两口子这条路算选对了，我代表党组织现在正式批准你到农业生产第一线去。”我乐得又加上一只手，紧握在黄书记这只千锤百炼的手上，千言万语说不出口，流下了激动的热泪。
