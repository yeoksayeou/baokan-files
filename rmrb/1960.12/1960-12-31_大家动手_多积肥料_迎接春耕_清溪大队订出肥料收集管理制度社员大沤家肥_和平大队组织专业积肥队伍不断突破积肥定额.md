　　This newspaper reports that Qingxi Brigade in Shaoshan Commune, Xiangtan, Hunan Province, has launched a winter fertilizer accumulation campaign centered on accumulating and producing household fertilizer, and has established a relatively complete household fertilizer collection and management system.
　　In addition to the brigade and production teams organizing labor to prepare fertilizer ponds and burn soil fertilizer, the Qingxi Brigade extensively mobilized commune members to vigorously prepare household ponds and accumulate human and animal manure. The household ponds that had been filled in by commune members have now been restored under the unified planning of the production team, based on the living conditions of the commune members, basically achieving one pond per household. Some commune members who raised pigs also built pig manure pits. Commune members use their time in the morning and evening to collect wild manure, prepare household ponds, repair toilets, and build manure pits, forming a mass movement.
　　In order to mobilize the enthusiasm of commune members for accumulating and producing household fertilizer, the Qingxi Brigade stipulates that: for collective accumulation of soil fertilizer, such as preparing field ponds and burning soil fertilizer, work points are generally recorded according to the quantity and quality of the completed fertilizer accumulation tasks. The work points are paid by the production team from the "three guarantees" work points and are included in the brigade's distribution. For household fertilizer accumulated by commune members individually, the production team generally pays commune members cash rewards from the "three guarantees" costs, according to the quantity and quality of the fertilizer delivered, but the fertilizer used for the production team's and canteen's self-sufficient production is paid by the production team from its own operating income. For the pond fertilizer and human and animal manure accumulated by the canteen, the portion used for large collective production is rewarded by the production team from the "three guarantees" costs, as the income of the canteen's small collective.
　　The Qingxi Brigade also reasonably distributes fertilizer accumulation tasks according to different fertilizer sources and fertilizer properties, and correctly stipulates the proportion of fertilizer use by the large collective, small collective, and individual commune members. The specific methods are: set fertilizer accumulation tasks, set fertilizer use ratios, and set reward and punishment measures. There are generally four situations: (1) For brigade pig farms, the implementation of "farm-team linkage", pig farms are required to hand over fertilizer to the production teams for use according to the prescribed fertilizer accumulation tasks (stipulating that 30% of the pig manure produced by each pig farm throughout the year is used for planting feed on the farm, and 70% is handed over to the production team). The production team pays the pig farm the price from the "three guarantees" costs, or offsets it with rice straw, sweet potato vines, etc. The brigade rewards the excess portion, with the pig farm and the breeder each receiving half of the bonus; (2) For production team fertilizer accumulation, the main task is to prepare field manure ponds, implementing "determining ponds based on fields, contracting fields based on ponds; assigning people to ponds, ensuring quality and quantity"; (3) For pond fertilizer and human and animal manure accumulated by the canteen, implement a 20-80 split, with the production team and canteen taking 20% and the large collective taking 80%. Set fertilizer delivery tasks for the production team and canteen's breeders and cooks according to the fertilizer accumulation quota, and reward them for exceeding the tasks; (4) For commune member household fertilizer accumulation, the masses reasonably assess the fertilizer accumulation tasks of each household commune member based on the fertilizer accumulation conditions and the number of people in each household. The production team gives appropriate rewards to those who overfulfill the tasks.
　　The Qingxi Brigade adopted the above methods, and after more than a month, the fertilizer accumulation work achieved great results. The entire brigade, with 605 households, has prepared more than 500 household ponds, one household pond per canteen, and some canteens have prepared two. The entire brigade, with 3,600 mu of paddy fields, has prepared more than 380 field manure ponds. The above have accumulated more than 110,000 dan of various pond manures, averaging 30 dan per mu. Human and animal manure is collected and used as it is collected, totaling more than 2,000 dan. In order to implement cash purchase, the brigade allocated 1,800 yuan of cash from the production team's "three guarantees" costs, as the price for the production team to buy household fertilizer from the commune members.

　　This newspaper, Hefei, 30th dispatched: Heping Brigade of ?jian Commune, Tianchang County, Anhui Province, is vigorously accumulating fertilizer in the following three aspects: organizing professional teams to accumulate fertilizer; mobilizing commune members to carry out household fertilizer accumulation; and accumulating pig and cattle manure and grass ash. For professional team fertilizer accumulation, tasks are assigned to the team, and the team then assesses fertilizer accumulation quotas based on each person's physical strength and technical conditions, implementing work point assessment, extra rewards, and daily cash settlement. The fertilizer accumulation tasks of each professional team in November were fully overfulfilled by the end of the month. From December 1st to 15th, eight teams completed 80% of the monthly task, one group completed 70%, and two groups overfulfilled. 97% of the 153 commune members participating in the fertilizer accumulation professional group exceeded the quota. For commune member household fertilizer accumulation, the brigade and each production team allocate fertilizer accumulation tasks according to the number of people in each household and the number of livestock and poultry raised, mobilizing every household to carry out fertilizer accumulation. For fertilizer accumulated by commune member households, each team forms a fertilizer price negotiation and purchase team composed of team cadres and impartial commune members, implementing price negotiation based on quality, cash purchase, and household purchase every five to seven days. Since the beginning of winter, the household fertilizer accumulated by the entire brigade and sold to the team has reached 65,000 dan, accounting for 20% of the total fertilizer accumulation of the entire brigade, and most of it is fine fertilizer. In order to take care of the fertilizer used on commune members' private plots, each team also reserves a certain amount for each household's own use when determining the task of selling household fertilizer to the team for each household commune member. For pig and cattle manure and grass ash accumulated in conjunction with pig and cattle raising and canteen cooking, tasks are assigned to pig farms, cattle houses, and canteens, and responsibilities are assigned to each breeder and cook, implementing rewards and cash payments. At present, nine of the eleven fertilizer accumulation professional teams have overfulfilled the fertilizer accumulation tasks assigned by the brigade every ten days; more than 90% of the 350 commune member household fertilizer accumulation have overfulfilled the tasks assigned by the production team; most of the 30 collective units engaged in fertilizer accumulation have exceeded the quota plan, and 95% of the 249 commune members directly participating in winter fertilizer accumulation have exceeded the quota. Since the beginning of winter, the entire brigade has collectively and in commune member households repaired and newly built 85 toilets, 328 chicken and duck pens and pigsties, and added more than 310 various fertilizer accumulation tools.

    大家动手　多积肥料　迎接春耕
    清溪大队订出肥料收集管理制度社员大沤家肥
    和平大队组织专业积肥队伍不断突破积肥定额
    本报讯　湖南湘潭韶山公社清溪大队，掀起了一个以积制家肥为中心的冬季积肥运动，并且制订了一套较为完整的家肥收集管理制度。
    清溪大队除了大队、生产小队组织劳力沤凼、烧火土以外，广泛地发动了社员大沤家凼，大积人畜粪尿。原来社员的家凼被填塞了的，现在根据社员居住情况，在生产小队统一规划下，都恢复起来了，基本上已经做到了一家一凼。有些养了猪的社员，还建了猪粪池。社员们利用早晚时间拾野粪、沤家凼、修厕所、建粪池，已形成了一个群众性的运动。
    为了调动社员积制家肥的积极性，清溪大队规定：集体积制土肥，如沤田凼、烧火土等，一般按照完成积肥任务的数量和质量记工分，工分由生产小队从“三包”工分支付，参加大队分配；社员个人积制的家肥，一般按照交肥的数量和质量，由生产小队从“三包”成本内付给社员现金报酬，但用于生产小队和食堂自给性生产的肥料，则由生产小队从自营收入中支付。食堂积制的凼肥、人畜粪，用于大集体生产部分，由生产小队从“三包”成本内付给报酬，作为食堂小集体的收入。
    清溪大队还根据不同肥源和肥料的性质，合理分配积肥任务，正确规定大集体、小集体与社员个人用肥的比例。具体作法是：定积肥任务、定用肥比例、定奖罚办法。一般有四种情况：（1）对于大队猪场，实行“场队挂钩”，猪场按规定的积肥任务（规定每个猪场全年所产猪粪，三成用于本场种植饲料，七成交给生产小队），定期交给生产小队使用，由生产小队从“三包”成本内付给猪场价款，或者以稻草、薯藤等顶付。超过部分由大队给奖励，猪场和饲养员各得奖金一半；（2）对于生产小队积肥，主要沤制田间粪凼，实行“以田定凼，以凼包田；定人定凼，保质保量”；（3）对于食堂积制的凼肥、人畜粪，实行二、八分成，生产小队和食堂二成，大集体八成，对生产小队和食堂的饲养员、炊事员按照积肥定额，规定交肥任务，超过任务的给以奖励；（4）对于社员家庭积肥，根据每户积肥条件和人口多少，由群众合理评定各户社员的积肥任务。超额完成任务的由生产小队给以适当奖励。
    清溪大队采取以上办法，经过一个多月时间，积肥工作取得了很大的成绩。全大队六百零五户，已沤家凼五百多个，每个食堂一个家凼，有一部分食堂沤了两个。全大队三千六百亩水田，已沤田间粪凼三百八十多个。以上共沤各种凼粪十一万余担，平均每亩达三十担。人畜粪尿随收随用，一共收集二千多担。为了贯彻执行现金收购，大队拨给生产小队“三包”成本一千八百元的现金，作为生产小队向社员收买家肥价款之用。
    本报合肥30日电　安徽省天长县?涧公社和平大队从以下三个方面大积肥料：组织专业队伍积肥；发动社员开展家庭积肥；积攒猪牛肥和草木灰。对专业队积肥，采取任务落实到队，队里再根据各人体力和技术条件评定积肥定额，实行评工记分、超额奖励，按日兑现。各专业队11月份的积肥任务，月底全面超额完成，12月份到15日止，有八个队完成全月任务的80％，一个组完成70％，两个组超额完成；一百五十三名参加积肥专业组的社员97％超过定额。对社员家庭积肥，大队和各生产小队按照每户人口多少、家畜家禽饲养头数，分配积肥任务，发动家家户户，开展积肥。对社员家庭积攒的肥料，各小队由小队干部和公正社员组成肥料议价收购小组，实行按质论价，现金收买，每五至七天逐户收购一次。入冬以来全大队积攒的家庭肥料，出售给小队的已达六万五千担，占全大队总积肥量20％，而且大部分是细肥。为了照顾社员自留地上的用肥，各小队在确定每户社员向队出售家庭肥料任务时，还留一定数量给各户自用。对结合养猪养牛、食堂烧饭等活动积攒的猪牛粪和草木灰，采取将任务落实到猪场、牛房、食堂，责任落实到每个饲养员和炊事员，实行奖励，报酬兑现。目前，十一个积肥专业队有九个旬旬超额完成大队分配的积肥任务；三百五十户社员家庭积肥有90％以上超额完成了生产小队分给的任务；三十个结合搞积肥的集体单位，大部分超过定额计划，二百四十九名直接参加冬季积肥的社员95％超过定额。入冬以后，全大队集体和社员家庭整修和新盖厕所八十五所，鸡鸭栏、猪圈三百二十八处，添制各种积肥工具三百一十多件。
