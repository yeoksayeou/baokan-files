Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th Dispatch: The Japan Peace Congress opened in Tokyo today. This three-day conference, convened by the Japan Peace Committee, will summarize the past year's peace movement in Japan and determine the movement's direction for the coming year.

	More than 300 active members of the peace movement from across the country are participating in the congress.

	Kenjuro Yanagida, Representative Committee Member of the Japan Peace Committee, spoke first at the meeting. He emphasized that the world's peace forces are overwhelming the forces of war year by year. If we strengthen the movement for peace on the basis of the struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," we will certainly be able to strike a heavier blow against the forces of war. He pointed out that the more unfavorable the situation is for the forces of war, the more ferocious they will become, and they will use more sinister means to carry out war provocations. Yanagida called on the participants to be vigilant and thoroughly expose the conspiracies of the war forces.

	Keian Kumakura, Permanent Director of the Japan Peace Committee, gave a general report at the meeting. He pointed out that through the struggle against the "Security Treaty" and the recent election struggle, we have seen a great increase in the political awareness of the Japanese people. This is the biggest factor that will deepen the contradictions between the Japanese people and the Ikeda Cabinet, and at the same time, it will promote the leap-forward development of the Japanese peace movement.

	Kumakura emphasized that the major tasks of the Japanese peace movement at present include striving for disarmament, opposing the strengthening of the militarist system and the expansion of the Japanese army, strengthening the common struggle with the people of Asian and African countries, and striving for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China.

	The congress read out congratulatory telegrams and letters to the congress from the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the German Peace Committee, the All-India Peace Council, and the Women's International Democratic Federation.

	The congress then heard reports on various issues and reports from local representatives.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th Dispatch: The Japan Asian-African Solidarity Committee held the "Asian-African Solidarity Congress Against Military Treaties and Foreign Military Bases" in Tokyo on the evening of the 8th. The congress unanimously passed a resolution stating that it would strengthen the struggle to completely abolish the military treaties concluded by imperialism with its running dogs in Asia and Africa, and to remove all troops stationed and all military bases established by imperialism in Asia and Africa.

	This congress is part of the "Joint Action Fortnight Against Military Alliances and Foreign Military Bases" launched by the Japan Asian-African Solidarity Committee on November 25 in response to the call of the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization. More than 400 people participated in the congress, including peace movement leaders such as Akira Kazami, Yoshitaro Hirano, and Tokumatsu Sakamoto, as well as well-known figures from all walks of life and representatives of various groups.

	The congress resolution said, as soldiers participating in the Asian-African common action front, we vow today, on this shameful day of the nineteenth anniversary of the Japanese imperialism launching the Pacific War, to devote all our efforts to striving for the abolition of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the removal of all U.S. military bases, the recovery of Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands from the United States, and the crushing of the "treaty" signed by Japan with the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the "Japan-Korea talks" to the end.

	Koishiro Okakura, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Japan Asian-African Solidarity Committee, and Shigeo Sato, Permanent Director, spoke at the meeting. They unanimously pointed out that the imperialists' and their followers' policies of aggression are being opposed by more and more people, and at the same time, the Japanese people's struggle for independence, peace, and neutrality is supported by the people of Asia and Africa.

	Cuban Ambassador to Japan Mario Alzugaray, Algerian National Liberation Front representative Kiouane, overseas Chinese representative Gan Wenfang, and Korean resident representative Cha Sang-cheol also delivered speeches at the meeting. The congress read out congratulatory telegrams and letters from the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee and the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace and the Korean Asian-African Solidarity Committee, which were greeted with warm applause from the participants.

    日本和平大会在东京开幕
    亚非团结委员会举行大会反对军事条约和外国军事基地
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：日本和平大会今天在东京开幕。由日本和平委员会召开的这次为期三天的大会将总结一年来的日本和平运动，并确定明年度的运动方针。
    来自全国各地的和平运动的积极分子三百多人参加了大会。
    日本和平委员会代表委员柳田谦十郎首先在会上讲话。他强调指出，世界和平力量一年比一年地压倒战争势力。如果我们以反对日美“安全条约”斗争为基础来加强争取和平的运动，一定能够更沉重地打击战争势力。他指出，形势对于战争势力越不利，它们就会越加凶暴，并用更加阴险的手段来进行战争挑衅。柳田呼吁与会者提高警惕，彻底揭露战争势力的阴谋。
    日本和平委员会常任理事熊仓启安在会上作了总报告。他指出，通过反对“安全条约”的斗争和最近的竞选斗争，我们看到日本人民的政治觉悟有很大的提高，这是促使日本人民同池田内阁的矛盾更加深刻化的最大因素，同时将促使日本和平运动取得飞跃的发展。
    熊仓强调指出，目前日本和平运动的重大任务包括争取裁军、反对加强军国主义体制和扩充日本军队、加强同亚非各国人民的共同斗争和争取恢复日中邦交。
    大会宣读了中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、德国和平委员会、全印和平理事会和国际民主妇女联合会给大会的贺电和贺信。
    大会接着听取了各项问题的报告和地方代表的报告。
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：日本亚非团结委员会8日晚上在东京举行“反对军事条约和外国军事基地亚非团结大会”。大会一致通过决议，表示将加强斗争，争取完全废除帝国主义同它在亚非的走狗们缔结的军事条约，撤除帝国主义在亚洲和非洲驻扎的军队和设立的一切军事基地。
    这个大会是日本亚非团结委员会为了响应亚非人民团结组织书记处的号召而从11月25日展开的“反对军事同盟和外国军事基地共同行动双周”活动的一部分。参加大会的有风见章、平野义太郎、坂本德松等和平运动领袖和各界著名人士以及各界团体代表四百多人。
    大会决议说，作为参加亚非共同行动阵线的战士，我们今天在日本帝国主义发动太平洋战争十九周年的这个可耻的日子发誓，要全力为争取废除新日美“安全条约”、撤销一切美军基地、从美国手里收回冲绳岛和小笠原群岛、粉碎日本同蒋介石集团签订的“条约”和“日韩会谈”而斗争到底。
    日本亚非团结委员会理事长冈仓古志郎和常任理事佐藤重雄在会上讲话。他们一致指出，帝国主义者和它的追随者的侵略政策遭到越来越多的人的反对，同时，日本人民争取独立、和平、中立的斗争受到了亚洲和非洲人民的支持。
    古巴驻日本大使马里奥·阿耳苏加赖、阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线代表基欧安、旅日华侨代表甘文芳和旅日朝侨代表斜相哲也在会上致词。大会宣读了中国亚非团结委员会和朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会以及朝鲜亚非团结委员会的贺电和贺信，与会者报以热烈的掌声。
