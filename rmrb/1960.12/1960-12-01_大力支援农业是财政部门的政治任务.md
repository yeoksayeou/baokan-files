Vigorously Supporting Agriculture is the Political Task of Financial Departments
Jin Ming, Vice Minister of Finance

The policy put forward by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong of developing China's national economy with agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor, and combining the priority development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture, profoundly reveals the internal relations between the various sectors of the national economy, clarifies an important law of China's socialist economy, and points out the important position and role of agriculture in the national economy. Resolutely and correctly implementing this policy is of great significance for accelerating socialist construction and ensuring the high-speed and proportionate development of the entire national economy.

To vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, we must rely on the efforts of the entire Party and the entire people. In order to accelerate the development of agriculture and grain production, gradually realize the modernization of agriculture, it is necessary to supply more and more agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides; to build farmland water conservancy projects; to develop agricultural electricity; to continuously improve the scientific and technological level of agricultural production; and to solve the problem of capital supply for agricultural development, and so on. All of these require the long-term and arduous efforts of the country's peasants, the mutual cooperation and vigorous support of various sectors of the national economy, and the vigorous support of financial departments. Actively supporting agriculture and promoting the rapid development of agriculture and grain production is not only an important economic task of financial departments, but also an important political task.

Socialist finance is built on the basis of production development and at the same time serves production construction. Therefore, agriculture, as the foundation of the national economy, has a significant impact on the development of national finance. Although the vast majority of China's fiscal revenue comes from state-owned enterprises, the realization of these revenues is closely related to agricultural production. The raw materials for China's light industry production rely heavily on agriculture for supply. The development of light industry and the speed at which it provides accumulation largely depend on the state of agricultural development. Agriculture is also closely related to the development of heavy industry, because the development of heavy industry requires agriculture to provide grain, labor, and markets, especially with the gradual development of agricultural technology transformation, the point that heavy industry must take agriculture as an important market has become increasingly clear. Comrade Mao Zedong made a thorough discussion of this relationship between agriculture, industry, and finance in the article "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation": "In order to complete the large amount of funds required for national industrialization and agricultural technology transformation, a considerable part of it must be accumulated from the agricultural sector. In addition to the direct agricultural tax, it is to develop the production of a large number of consumer goods needed by farmers, and exchange these things for farmers' commodity grain and light industrial raw materials, which not only satisfies the material needs of farmers and the state, but also accumulates funds for the state." The development of fiscal revenue in China over the past few years fully proves the correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong's assertion. Whenever agriculture had a bumper harvest in the previous year, industrial production and fiscal revenue in the following year would have a relatively large increase. This shows that the agricultural issue is a fundamental issue in developing socialist construction and also a fundamental issue that determines the speed of capital accumulation for national construction.

Agriculture not only largely determines the scale and speed of the growth of national fiscal revenue, but also has a significant relationship with national fiscal expenditure. National fiscal expenditure is arranged according to the needs of national economic development, and it must fully consider various factors. The state of agricultural production is one of the important factors that determine the scale of construction, the speed of construction, and fiscal expenditure. If agriculture can provide more grain and raw materials, industrial production and capital construction can develop faster, and capital construction investment can have a greater increase. It can be seen that how fiscal expenditure is allocated, how much capital construction investment is expanded, and how much the expenditure on other undertakings is increased cannot but take into account the state of agricultural production.

The close relationship between agricultural production and fiscal revenue and expenditure determines that financial work must vigorously support the development of agricultural production. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have always instructed the staff of financial departments to regard supporting agricultural production as an important task of financial work. As early as the War of Resistance Against Japan, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "County and district party and government workers should devote 90 percent of their energy to helping farmers increase production on financial and economic issues, and then devote 10 percent of their energy to collecting taxes from farmers. If you put in hard work on the former, the latter will be easy." Since 1953, the Party and the government have stipulated the policy of stabilizing the burden on farmers in terms of agricultural tax. This policy of increasing production without increasing taxes has been implemented to this day and has been warmly welcomed by the masses of farmers. As a result of the stabilization of the burden on farmers, the income that increases year by year with the development of agricultural production is basically left to the farmers, expanding agricultural production investment and giving play to the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers in developing production. Over the years, in accordance with the instructions of the Party and the government, the state finance has also allocated a large amount of funds from the budget to support the development of agricultural production, to build farmland water conservancy projects, and to expand the production of agricultural production materials. The state's expenditure in this area has increased year by year. Taking this year as an example, the state's budget alone has a free investment of 1.5 billion yuan directly to the People's Commune, which is close to one-half of the agricultural tax directly taken by the finance from the People's Commune. Practice has proved that vigorously supporting agriculture in financial work not only promotes the development of agricultural production, but also provides the necessary conditions for the smooth realization of the state budget.

Although the financial department has achieved certain results in supporting agriculture, and the financial cadres have a certain understanding of the importance of supporting agriculture; however, the idea of ​​supporting agriculture has not been universally and firmly established in the financial staff, and a few comrades still have some incorrect views on this. Some comrades believe that the agricultural production cycle is long, and the effect of investment is not as fast as that of industry. Therefore, when arranging agricultural investment, there are such or such concerns, and even the investment stipulated by the state for agricultural production is withdrawn for other purposes. Some comrades also believe that vigorously supporting agriculture is only to change the current situation of low agricultural production levels in China, not a long-term work policy. These views are incorrect. It should be recognized that it is precisely because agriculture has a long production cycle that it needs more support from state finance. As for the economic effect of agricultural investment, it should not only be viewed from agriculture itself, but must be examined from the development of the entire national economy, and must be examined from the standpoint of "agriculture is the foundation of the national economy." It should also be recognized that supporting the development of agricultural production is by no means just an extremely important measure in our current work, but a long-term policy. In China, a large country with agriculture accounting for a large proportion of the national economy and more than 500 million peasants, only by taking agriculture as the foundation can we develop the national economy both at high speed and proportionately, accelerate the country's socialist industrialization, further strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, consolidate and develop the People's Commune, and prepare conditions for the gradual construction of socialism and the future transition to communism. Therefore, vigorously supporting the development of agricultural production is a long-term work policy of the financial department. How well the work of supporting agriculture is done is one of the important signs to test financial work. The financial staff must deeply understand the extremely important instructions of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong on agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, firmly establish the idea of ​​vigorously supporting agriculture, and complete the support of agriculture as an important strategic task.

What work must the financial department focus on in order to vigorously support agriculture?

First, from the perspective of national financial investment, vigorously support the development of agricultural production. To develop agricultural production at a high speed, it is necessary to continuously increase investment in expanded reproduction in agriculture. In particular, the technological transformation of agriculture requires a large amount of capital investment. Supporting the development of agricultural production from the perspective of national financial investment is an important feature of socialist finance. At present, the funds used to support agriculture in China's national budget roughly include the following parts: 1. The free investment of the national budget in the People's Commune. This is the fund directly allocated by the national budget to the People's Commune for the development of agricultural production. It is mainly to help the commune and the production team gradually realize the technological transformation of agriculture, and help the poor teams and poor communes to catch up with the rich teams and rich communes in production as soon as possible. Under the leadership of the Party committees at all levels, the financial department must pay this part of the funds in a timely manner according to the established distribution plan, and ensure that it is used in agricultural production. In the future, all matters that are conducive to the development of agricultural production should be strongly supported by the financial departments at all levels, and the funds should be paid proactively and promptly in accordance with the national plan to serve the development of agricultural production. 2. The funds used for farmland water conservancy in the national budget and the agricultural and forestry operating expenses used for promoting fine agricultural varieties and improving agricultural production technology are also direct investments for developing agricultural production. The financial department should cooperate with relevant departments to maximize the effectiveness of this part of the funds, and strive to do more with the same amount of money. 3. The industrial investment in the national budget used to develop agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides. Although this part of the money is not directly used in agricultural production, the production of these industries directly serves agricultural production. In particular, the development of the agricultural machinery industry will provide a material and technical foundation for the technological transformation of agriculture. For this part of the investment, the financial department should cooperate with relevant departments to reasonably arrange and use it in accordance with the national plan, actively support these industrial enterprises to implement technological innovation and technological revolution, strive to develop production, improve product quality, increase product varieties, and reduce production costs, provide agriculture with more inexpensive, high-quality, economical, and applicable agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, pesticides and other products to support the development of agricultural production.

Agricultural production is highly seasonal. When the financial department pays the state's investment in support of agriculture, it must fully pay attention to this feature, so that it can be allocated quickly and used well, without delaying the agricultural season and ahead of the production season. While allocating funds, it should help the commune and production team to use the funds rationally, and strive to ensure that the supply of materials can keep up closely. That is to say, the financial department should not only be concerned about the timely allocation and rational use of funds, but also be concerned about the timely supply of materials. Since this year, when the financial departments in many places have paid the state's free investment in the People's Commune, they have taken the initiative to understand the production needs of the commune and the production team, and contacted the supply and marketing department to deliver the funds allocated to the commune and the team and the production materials needed by the commune and the team in a timely manner. This has not only supported agricultural production, but also encouraged the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members.

Second, help the commune and the production team strengthen financial management and adhere to the principle of running the commune diligently and thriftily. The rural People's Commune leads production and organizes and arranges the lives of commune members. In particular, the production team directly leads and manages the production and lives of the commune members. Therefore, it is necessary to resolutely implement the principle of running the commune diligently and thriftily, strengthen the operation and management of the commune and the production team, and only then can we improve various production undertakings and the lives of commune members and accelerate the development of agriculture.

Financial management is an important part of the operation and management of the commune and the team. The quality of financial management has a direct impact on the speed of development of the various production and construction undertakings of the commune and the team. Only by doing a good job in financial work can we rationally arrange and use funds, carefully calculate, and manage the housework of the commune and the team. In particular, the current family background of the commune and the team is not yet thick, and it is even more necessary to strengthen financial management and adhere to the principle of running the commune diligently and thriftily. This is a major event that the broad masses of commune members are extremely concerned about, and it is also an important task for the financial department to support agriculture.

In order to strengthen the financial management of the commune and the team, the financial department must, under the leadership of the Party, help the People's Commune, especially the production team, establish and improve the financial management system in accordance with the "three-level ownership, team-based" People's Commune system and the principle of diligent and thrifty commune management and democratic management. With a financial system that correctly reflects the Party's policies, it is possible to correctly implement the Party's policies in financial work. When establishing and improving the financial management system, we must focus on helping the commune and the team establish and improve the four basic systems (namely, the financial planning system, the accounting system, the cash management system, and the material management system). The establishment and improvement of the system must follow the mass line, mobilize the masses to discuss, implement democratic management, and implement it under the supervision of the commune members. The establishment and improvement of the financial system is ultimately to promote the development of production in the commune and the team. Therefore, establishing and improving the financial system of the commune and the team and conscientiously implementing it can adhere to the principle of diligent and thrifty commune management, improve the level of operation and management, and promote the development of agricultural production.

While establishing and improving the financial system, the financial department should also help the commune and the team do a good job in arranging and managing funds to ensure the rational distribution and economical use of funds. This is also an important step in adhering to the principle of diligent and thrifty commune management. Over the past two years, with the rapid development of production in the commune and the team, the funds that the commune and the team can provide for production and construction have increased, but the things that need to be done have also increased. Therefore, there is still a certain degree of contradiction between construction needs and the supply of funds. In particular, those poor teams and poor communes urgently need to solve the problem of capital supply in order to catch up with the rich teams and rich communes. The financial department should help them comprehensively arrange the plan for the use of funds according to the needs and possibilities of the commune and the team. We must implement long-term plans and short-term arrangements, with both annual financial revenue and expenditure plans and short-term arrangements that adapt to the seasonal characteristics of agricultural production and the distribution season. The arrangement of various funds for the commune and the team must be based on the spirit of seeking truth from facts, leaving room for maneuver, being diligent and thrifty, and making careful plans for the funds, and the use of funds must be strictly managed without wasting a penny.

The financial department should also act as a consultant for the commune and the team, give ideas, find ways, and open up sources of funds. The way to open up sources of funds is mainly to help the production team implement the policy of taking grain as the key link and developing diversified operations. We must actively help the commune and the team develop twelve productions such as grain, cotton, oil, hemp, silk, tea, sugar, vegetables, tobacco, fruit, medicine, and miscellaneous, and implement the principle of taking grain as the key link and developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries simultaneously. To speed up the development of production through financial management is an important feature of socialist financial work.

Third, help the commune and the production team do a good job in distribution and implement the Party's distribution policy. Helping the commune and the production team to do a good job in distribution, rationally distribute, and arrange the lives of the commune members is a very important task for the financial department to serve the development of production in the commune and the team.

An important condition for doing a good job in distribution is to verify income and distinguish the boundaries of three-level ownership. The so-called verifying income means that the products harvested by the commune and the production team must be recorded in the accounts according to the actual harvest, actual striking, weighing and warehousing numbers, and the cash income must be recorded in the accounts according to the actual numbers received. No matter the income from agricultural and sideline products and cash income, we must seek truth from facts, record as much as there is in the account, one is one, two is two. When verifying income and warehousing and recording accounts, we must pay special attention to distinguishing the three-level ownership, whoever's it is, record it in whose name, whoever's it is, whoever owns it, the boundaries are clear, and it is clear at a glance. The income belonging to the production team must be recorded in the income account of the production team, and must not be confused, otherwise, it is impossible to correctly distribute.

After verifying the income and recording the accounts clearly, we must do a good job of calculating the distribution account. Calculating the distribution account means that according to the Party's distribution policy and the requirements of the higher Party committee, combined with the specific circumstances of the time and place, the distribution plan is tentatively calculated to provide reference for the Party committee. If the distribution account is done well, it can provide data for the commune and the production team to carry out distribution, which is conducive to correctly handling the relationship between the large collective and the small collective, the collective and the commune members, and mobilizing the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members. This is a highly policy-oriented work, which is related to the implementation of a series of policies of the Party on the People's Commune. Under the leadership of the Party, the financial department must help the commune and the team to tentatively calculate this year's consumption part of the commune members through the work of calculating the distribution account, and how much is the retained part, that is, production costs, management fees, state taxes, public accumulation fund, public welfare fund, etc. Through this tentative calculation, we must rationally arrange production and the lives of commune members according to the Party's policies, and the relationship between production and capital construction, the wage part and the supply part, the state and the collective, and the large collective and the small collective. After the distribution plan is determined by the Party committee, the financial department will work with relevant departments to arrange and use the funds and materials well, and organize the implementation of the distribution plan under the leadership of the Party committee. The financial department serves to do a good job in distribution, and helps the commune and the team to do a good job in calculating the distribution account and implementing the distribution plan, which is conducive to correctly implementing the Party's distribution policy and is conducive to mobilizing the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members.

Fourth, help the commune and the production team carry out economic accounting and Promote the Development of Agricultural Production. Economic accounting is an important method for managing the socialist economy. As a production unit, the commune and the production team must of course also carry out economic accounting. Economic accounting is not mysterious. Implementing economic accounting is to register, calculate, and compare the daily production activities and other economic activities of the commune members, mobilize the masses to take effective measures, use the least manpower, material resources, and financial resources to achieve the greatest labor results and achieve more, faster, better, and more economical in production. The financial department should vigorously help the commune and the team carry out economic accounting to serve the promotion of production.

For the economic accounting of the commune and the production team, we must consider the characteristics of the commune, the team, and agricultural production, and it must be simple and easy to implement. At present, the financial department should, in accordance with the principle of "three-level ownership, team-based", focus on helping the production team actively carry out economic accounting work. The economic accounting of the production team should be carried out on the basis of implementing the "three guarantees and one reward" system. It is necessary to verify the output, calculate the "three guarantees" accounts, and implement the overproduction reward system to mobilize the production enthusiasm of the contracted production units and the masses of commune members. In the production process, it is also necessary to help the contracted production team regularly conduct accounting analysis of various production costs and labor work points, and in particular, to strengthen the accounting and analysis of labor work points. It is necessary to compare production costs, labor days, and production results between the previous period and the current period, between the contracted production team and the contracted production team, between the work team and the work team, and between the commune members, to see which is advanced, which is backward, which is economical, and which is wasteful, find out the key to the problem, and promote the backward to learn from the advanced.

The financial department should not only help the financial accountants of the commune and the production team carry out professional accounting, but also help them mobilize the commune members to participate in accounting, carry out mass economic accounting, and closely integrate professional accounting with mass economic accounting. Mobilizing commune members to participate in economic accounting is an important aspect of the democratic management of the commune and the team. Only when commune members participate in production management and financial management can they truly be masters of their own affairs. Commune members are production laborers, and they are most familiar with the production situation, where there is potential, where there is waste, what is advanced, and what is backward. Once economic accounting is mastered by the masses of commune members, it can become a powerful weapon for carrying out socialist labor emulation and promoting the movement to increase production and practice economy, and it also enriches the content of the People's Commune's democratic management system. Therefore, the financial department should help the financial accountants of the commune and the team to actively carry out mass economic accounting while strengthening professional accounting, mobilize the commune members to manage finances, account for everything, and handle finances for everyone, and put financial work under the participation and supervision of the commune members. Only by combining professional accounting with mass economic accounting can the role of economic accounting be fully exerted and better serve to accelerate the development of production.

While doing the above work, the financial department must also gradually cultivate a team of financial accountants who are both red and expert for the commune and the production team. Managing the finances of the commune and the team is to manage the housework well for the commune members. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that the financial work of the commune and the team is in the hands of people who have good components, high awareness, are fair and selfless, and can contact the masses. At the same time, under the leadership of the Party committee, the financial department must conduct planned training for the financial personnel of the commune and the team. For the training of the financial personnel of the commune and the team, the first is to improve their political and ideological level, and the second is to improve their professional level. It is necessary to put politics in command as a prerequisite, combine politics with business, and combine theory with practice. There can be many ways of training, and it is best to adapt to local conditions and times. It is necessary to improve the political and professional level of the financial accountants of the commune and the team through various methods, especially through various mass movements.

Supporting the rapid development of agricultural production is the current and long-term political task of the financial department. The financial department must support agriculture in every possible way under the leadership of the Party. The financial cadres must firmly establish the idea that the national economy is based on agriculture, and in particular, they must work hard to study a series of policies on the development of agricultural production and the People's Commune instructed by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and resolutely implement them in actual work, and resolutely struggle against all phenomena that violate the policies. In the work of collecting agricultural taxes, we must continue to implement the policy of stabilizing the burden on farmers and increasing production without increasing taxes to promote the development of agricultural production. At the same time, the financial cadres must continue to improve their work style, not only to go all out, but also to seek truth from facts, and to do a solid and diligent job in supporting agricultural production. The financial departments at all levels should systematically send a large number of cadres deep into the commune and the production team to eat, live, work, and discuss with the commune members, and wholeheartedly help the commune and the team manage their housework well, live a good life, and accelerate the development of agricultural production.

At present, the mass movement of the whole Party and the whole people to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production is developing in depth. The national financial cadres must actively participate in this movement, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of not being afraid of difficulties and being indestructible, act as a promoter of supporting agriculture, support agriculture in every possible way, and strive to accelerate the development of agricultural production.

    大力支援农业是财政部门的政治任务
    财政部副部长　金明
    党中央和毛泽东同志提出的我国国民经济的发展以农业为基础、以工业为主导，把优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业结合起来的方针，深刻地揭示了国民经济各部门的内在关系，阐明了我国社会主义经济的一个重要规律，指出了农业在国民经济中的重要地位和作用。坚决正确地贯彻执行这个方针，对于加快社会主义建设，保证整个国民经济高速度按比例地发展，具有重大的意义。
    大办农业、大办粮食，必须依靠全党全民的努力。为了加快农业和粮食生产的发展，逐步实现农业的现代化，需要供应越来越多的农业机械、化学肥料、农药，需要兴修农田水利，发展农业用电，需要不断地提高农业生产的科学技术水平，需要解决发展农业的资金供应问题，等等。所有这些，必须依靠全国农民进行长期的艰巨的努力，需要国民经济各部门互相配合，大力支援，也需要财政部门的大力支援。积极支援农业，促进农业和粮食生产的迅速发展，不仅是财政部门的一项重要的经济任务，而且是一项重要的政治任务。
    社会主义财政是建筑在生产发展的基础上，同时又是为生产建设服务的。因此，作为国民经济基础的农业，对于国家财政的发展有着重大的影响。我国的财政收入虽然绝大部分是来自国营企业，但是这些收入的实现，同农业生产有着十分密切的关系。我国轻工业生产的原料，绝大部分依靠农业来供应。轻工业的发展以及它提供积累的速度，在很大程度上决定于农业发展的状况。农业同重工业的发展同样也有密切的关系，因为重工业的发展，需要农业提供粮食、劳动力和市场，特别是随着农业技术改造的逐步发展，重工业要以农业为重要市场这一点，已经看得越来越清楚。农业、工业和财政的这种关系，毛泽东同志曾经在《关于农业合作化问题》一文中，作了透彻的论述：“为了完成国家工业化和农业技术改造所需要的大量资金，其中有一个相当大的部分是要从农业方面积累起来的。这除了直接的农业税以外，就是发展为农民所需要的大量生活资料的轻工业的生产，拿这些东西去同农民的商品粮食和轻工业原料相交换，既满足了农民和国家两方面的物资需要，又为国家积累了资金。”我国几年来财政收入的发展情况，充分证明了毛泽东同志的这一论断的正确性。凡是上年农业丰收了，第二年的工业生产和财政收入就有较大幅度的增长。这就说明，农业问题是发展社会主义建设的一个根本问题，也是决定国家建设资金积累速度的一个根本问题。
    农业不仅在很大程度上决定着国家财政收入增长的规模和速度，而且对于国家财政支出，也有着重大的关系。国家财政支出是根据国民经济发展的需要来安排的，它必须充分考虑到各方面的因素。农业生产的状况，就是决定建设规模、建设速度和财政支出的重要因素之一。农业能够提供更多的粮食和原料，工业生产和基本建设才能有更快的发展，基本建设投资才能有更大幅度的增长。由此可见，财政支出怎样分配，基本建设投资扩大多少，其他各项事业开支增长多少，都不能不考虑农业生产的状况。
    农业生产同财政收支的密切关系，决定了财政工作必须大力支援农业生产的发展。党中央和毛泽东同志历来指示财政部门的工作人员，要把支援农业生产当做财政工作的重要任务。早在抗日战争时期，毛泽东同志就说过：“县区党政工作人员在财政经济问题上，应以百分之九十的精力帮助农民增加生产，然后以百分之十的精力从农民取得税收。对前者用了苦功，对后者便轻而易举。” 1953年以来，党和政府规定了在农业税方面实行稳定农民负担的方针。这个增产不增税的方针，一直执行到现在，受到了农民群众的热烈欢迎。农民负担稳定的结果，随着农业生产发展而逐年增加的收入，基本上留给了农民，扩大了农业生产投资，发挥了广大农民发展生产的积极性。多年来，根据党和政府的指示，国家财政还从预算中拨出了大量的资金，用来支援农业生产的发展，兴修农田水利，扩大农业生产资料的生产。国家用于这方面的开支，一年比一年增大。拿今年来说，单是国家预算中直接对人民公社的无偿投资就有十五亿元，接近于财政上直接取之于人民公社的农业税的二分之一。实践证明，财政工作大力支援农业，不仅促进了农业生产的发展，也为国家预算的顺利实现，提供了必要的条件。
    财政部门支援农业的工作虽然取得了一定的成绩，财政干部对于支援农业的重要意义也有了一定的认识；但是支援农业的思想还没有在财政工作人员中普遍地牢固地树立起来，少数同志对此还有一些不正确的看法。有的同志认为，农业生产周期长，投资的效果不如工业来得快，因而在安排农业投资的时候，有这样或那样的顾虑，甚至把国家规定用于农业生产方面的投资抽去作其他用途。也有的同志认为，大力支援农业，仅仅是为了改变我国目前农业生产水平不高的状况，不是一个长远的工作方针。这些看法，都是不对的。应当认识，正是因为农业的生产周期长，才更加需要国家财政的支援。至于农业投资的经济效果，不仅要从农业本身去看，而且必须从整个国民经济的发展去考察，必须从“农业是国民经济的基础”这个立脚点去考察。还应当认识，支援农业生产的发展，决不只是我们工作中当前的极为重要的措施，而且是一个长远的方针。在我国这样一个农业在国民经济中占很大比重、农民有五亿多的大国里进行社会主义建设，只有以农业为基础，才能既高速度又按比例地发展国民经济，才能加快国家的社会主义工业化，才能进一步加强工农联盟，巩固和发展人民公社，为逐步建成社会主义和将来过渡到共产主义准备条件。因此，大力支援农业生产的发展是财政部门的一个长期的工作方针。支援农业的工作做得如何，是检验财政工作的重要标志之一。财政工作人员必须深刻地领会党中央和毛泽东同志关于农业是国民经济的基础这个极其重要的指示，牢固地树立起大力支援农业的思想，把支援农业当做重要的战略任务去完成。
    财政部门大力支援农业，必须抓紧做好哪些工作呢？
    第一，从国家财政投资方面，大力支援农业生产的发展。要高速度地发展农业生产，就必须不断地增加农业扩大再生产的投资。特别是农业的技术改造，更需要投入大量的资金。从国家财政投资方面支援农业生产的发展，这是社会主义财政的一个重要特征。目前，我国国家预算中用于支援农业的资金，大体上有这样几个部分：一、国家预算对人民公社的无偿投资，这是国家预算直接拨给人民公社用于发展农业生产的资金，主要是为了帮助公社、生产队逐步实现农业的技术改造，帮助穷队、穷社在生产上早日赶上富队、富社。财政部门必须在各级党委的领导下，根据已经确定的分配计划，及时拨付这部分资金，并且保证用于农业生产方面。今后，凡是有利于发展农业生产的事情，各级财政部门就应当大力支持，并按照国家规定的计划，主动地及时地拨付资金，为农业生产的发展服务。二、国家预算中用于兴修农田水利的资金和用于推广农业优良品种、改良农业生产技术等方面的农林事业费，这也是直接用来发展农业生产的投资。财政部门应当协同有关部门，最大限度地发挥这部分资金的效用，努力做到用同样多的钱办更多的事。三、国家预算中用于发展农业机械、化学肥料和农药等方面的工业投资，这部分钱虽然并不是直接用于农业生产方面，但是，这些工业生产是直接为农业生产服务的。特别是农业机械工业的发展，将为农业的技术改造提供物质技术基础。财政部门对于这部分投资，要按照国家规定的计划，协同有关部门合理安排使用，积极支持这些工业企业实行技术革新和技术革命，努力发展生产，提高产品质量，增加产品品种，降低生产成本，为农业提供更多的价廉物美、经济适用的农业机械、化学肥料和农药等产品，支援农业生产的发展。
    农业生产的季节性很强，财政部门在拨付国家支援农业的投资的时候，必须充分注意到这个特点，做到拨快用好，不误农时，赶在生产季节的前面。在拨付款项的同时，应当帮助公社、生产队合理地使用资金，并且努力做到物资供应能够紧紧地跟上去。这就是说，财政部门不仅要关心资金的及时拨付和合理使用，而且要关心物资的及时供应。今年以来，许多地方财政部门在拨付国家对人民公社的无偿投资的时候，主动地去了解公社、生产队的生产需要，联系供销部门，把拨给社、队的资金和社、队所需的生产资料，都及时地送上门去。这样做，既支援了农业生产，又鼓舞了广大社员群众的劳动热情。
    第二，帮助公社、生产队加强财务管理，坚持勤俭办社。农村人民公社既领导生产，又组织安排社员生活，特别是生产队直接领导、管理着社员群众的生产和生活。因此，必须坚决贯彻勤俭办社的方针，加强公社、生产队经营管理工作，才能够把各项生产事业和社员的生活搞好，加快农业的发展。
    财务管理工作是社、队经营管理工作的一个重要环节。财务管理工作的好坏，对于社、队的各项生产建设事业发展得快慢，有着直接的影响。财务工作做好了，才能够合理地安排和使用资金，精打细算，管好社、队的家务。特别是目前社、队的家底还不厚，更加需要加强财务管理，坚持勤俭办社的方针。这是广大社员群众极为关心的一件大事，也是财政部门支援农业的一项重要任务。
    为了加强社、队的财务管理工作，财政部门必须在党的领导下，根据“三级所有、队为基础”的人民公社制度和勤俭办社、民主管理的方针，帮助人民公社特别是生产队，建立和健全财务管理制度。有了正确地体现党的政策的财务制度，才有可能在财务工作中正确地贯彻执行党的各项政策。在建立和健全财务管理制度的时候，要着重帮助社、队把四个基本制度（即财务计划制度、会计制度、现金管理制度、物资管理制度）建立和健全起来。制度的建立和健全，必须走群众路线，发动群众讨论，实行民主管理，在社员群众的监督下贯彻执行。建立和健全财务制度，归根到底是为了促进社、队生产的发展。因此，把社、队财务制度建立和健全起来，并且认真地贯彻执行，才能坚持勤俭办社，提高经营管理水平，促进农业生产的发展。
    在建立和健全财务制度的同时，财政部门还应当帮助社、队搞好资金的安排和管理，保证资金的合理分配和节约使用。这也是坚持勤俭办社的一个重要步骤。两年多来，随着社、队生产的迅速发展，社、队自己能够提供生产建设的资金增加了，但是，需要办的事情也增加了。因此，在建设需要同资金供应之间，仍然存在着一定程度的矛盾。特别是那些穷队穷社，为了赶上富队富社，迫切需要解决资金的供应问题。财政部门应当根据社、队的需要和可能，帮助他们全面安排资金的使用计划。要实行长计划短安排，既有年度的财务收支计划，又有适应农业生产季节和分配季节特点的短期安排。安排社、队的各种资金，一定要本着实事求是，留有余地，勤俭节约的精神，周密地做好资金的计划安排，并且对资金的使用要严格管理，不浪费一文钱。
    财政部门还要为社、队当参谋，出主意，寻找门路，开辟资金来源。开辟资金来源的这条道路，主要是帮助生产队贯彻执行以粮为纲，发展多种经营的方针。要积极帮助社、队发展粮、棉、油、麻、丝、茶、糖、菜、烟、果、药、杂等十二项生产，实行以粮为纲，农林牧副渔五业并举。通过财务管理工作去帮助社、队加快发展生产，这是社会主义财务工作的一个重要特点。
    第三，帮助公社、生产队做好分配工作，贯彻执行党的分配政策。帮助公社、生产队做好分配工作，合理进行分配，安排好社员的生活，这是财政部门为社、队发展生产服务的一项很重要的工作。
    做好分配工作的一个重要条件是核实收入，划清三级所有的界限。所谓核实收入，就是公社和生产队收获的产品，必须根据实收实打、过秤入库的数字记账，现金收入则须根据实际到手的数字记账。不论农副产品收入和现金收入，都要实事求是，有多少就在账上记多少，一是一，二是二。在核实收入和入库记账的时候，还要特别注意区别三级所有，是谁的就记在谁的名下，是谁的就归谁所有，界限分明，一清二楚。属于生产队的收入，必须记在生产队的收入账上，绝不可混淆不清，否则，就不可能正确地进行分配。
    在核实收入、记清账目以后，还要做好算清分配账的工作。算清分配账，就是根据党的分配政策和上级党委的要求，结合当时当地的具体情况，试算分配方案，提供党委参考。分配账做好了，就可以为公社、生产队进行分配提供数据，从而有利于正确地处理大集体和小集体、集体和社员之间的关系，调动广大社员群众的生产积极性。这是一项政策性很强的工作，它关系到党关于人民公社一系列的方针、政策的贯彻执行。财政部门必须在党的领导下，帮助社、队通过算清分配账的工作，很好地试算本年社员消费部分是多少，扣留部分即生产费、管理费、国家税收、公积金、公益金等是多少。要通过这种试算，按照党的政策合理地安排生产和社员生活，生产和基本建设、工资部分和供给部分、国家和集体以及大集体和小集体之间的关系问题。在分配方案经过党委确定以后，财政部门就要会同有关部门帮助社、队把资金和物资安排好、使用好，在党委的领导下，组织分配方案的兑现。财政部门为做好分配工作服务，帮助社、队把算清分配账和实现分配方案的工作做好了，就有利于正确地贯彻执行党的分配政策，有利于调动广大社员群众的生产积极性。
    第四，帮助公社、生产队开展经济核算，促进农业生产的发展。经济核算是管理社会主义经济的一个重要方法。作为一个生产单位来说，公社、生产队当然也必须进行经济核算。经济核算并不神秘。实行经济核算，就是把社员群众的日常生产活动和其他经济活动，进行登记、计算和比较，发动群众采取有效措施，用最少的人力、物力和财力，取得最大的劳动成果，实现生产上的多快好省。财政部门应当大力帮助社、队开展经济核算，为促进生产服务。
    对于公社、生产队的经济核算，必须考虑社、队和农业生产的特点，并且要做到简便易行。目前，财政部门要根据“三级所有、队为基础”的原则，着重地帮助生产队积极开展经济核算工作。生产队的经济核算应当在贯彻执行“三包一奖”制度的基础上进行。要核实产量，算清“三包”账目，贯彻执行超产奖励制度，以调动包产单位和社员群众的生产积极性。在生产过程中，还要帮助包产小队经常进行各项生产费用和劳动工分的核算分析，特别要加强对劳动工分的核算和分析。要在上期同本期之间、包产小队与包产小队之间、作业组与作业组之间、以及社员与社员之间，核算比较生产费用、劳动日和生产成果，看看到底哪个先进，哪个落后，哪个节约，哪个浪费，找出问题的关键，推动落后的向先进的看齐。
    财政部门不仅要帮助公社、生产队的财务会计人员进行专业核算，还应当帮助他们发动社员群众参加核算，开展群众性的经济核算，使专业核算同群众性的经济核算紧密地结合起来。发动社员群众参加经济核算、是社、队实行民主管理的一个重要方面。社员群众既参加生产管理，又参加财务管理，才能真正做到当家作主。公社社员是生产劳动者，他们最熟悉生产情况，哪里有潜力，哪里有浪费，什么是先进，什么是落后，他们最清楚。经济核算一旦为社员群众所掌握，就能够成为开展社会主义劳动竞赛、促进增产节约运动的有力武器，同时也丰富了人民公社民主管理制度的内容。因此，财政部门应当帮助社、队财务会计人员在加强专业核算的同时，积极开展群众性的经济核算，发动社员群众人人理财、人人算账、大家办财务，把财务工作放在社员群众的参与和监督之下。专业核算同群众性的经济核算结合起来，才能够充分发挥经济核算的作用，更好地为加快发展生产服务。
    在做好以上几项工作的同时，财政部门还必须帮助公社、生产队逐步地培养起一支又红又专的财务会计人员的队伍。管理社、队的财务，就是替社员群众管好家务。因此，一定要保证社、队的财务工作掌握在成分好、觉悟高、办事公正无私并且能够联系群众的人的手里。同时，财政部门必须在党委的领导下，对社、队的财务人员，有计划地进行培训工作。对于社、队财务人员的培训，首先是提高他们的政治思想水平，其次才是提高他们的业务水平，要做到以政治挂帅为前提，政治与业务相结合，理论与实践相结合。培训的方法可以多种多样，最好是因地因时制宜，要通过各种方式，特别是要通过各种群众运动去提高社、队财务会计人员的政治水平和业务水平。
    支援农业生产的迅速发展，是财政部门当前的也是长期的政治任务。财政部门必须在党的领导下，千方百计地支援农业。财政干部必须牢固地树立起国民经济以农业为基础的思想，特别是要下苦功学习党中央和毛泽东同志所指示的关于发展农业生产和人民公社的一系列的政策，并且在实际工作中坚决地贯彻执行，同一切违反政策的现象作坚决的斗争。在征收农业税的工作中，要继续执行稳定农民负担、增产不增税的政策，以促进农业生产的发展。同时，财政干部还要不断改进工作作风，既要鼓足干劲，又要实事求是，老老实实、勤勤恳恳地做好支援农业生产的工作。各级财政部门应当有计划地派遣大批干部深入到公社和生产队去，与社员群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，全心全意地帮助社、队管好家务，过好日子，加速农业生产的发展。
    目前，全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的群众运动正在深入发展，全国财政干部一定要积极地投入这个运动，发扬不怕困难和无坚不摧的革命精神，充当支援农业的促进派，千方百计地支援农业，为加快发展农业生产而奋斗。
