Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 29th: Japanese Communist Party, Socialist Party, and leaders of various organizations, in reviewing the achievements of the Japanese people's struggle in 1960, unanimously stated their determination to strengthen the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its agents in the New Year, and to make greater contributions to the independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality of Japan.
    Leaders of various progressive political parties and mass organizations expressed their fighting resolve in talks with Japanese reporters and in articles published in newspapers and magazines.
    Nosaka Sanzo, Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, told reporters that the task facing the Japanese Communist Party next year is to make every effort to organize the people's struggle to realize their various demands, and to overcome the weaknesses within the democratic forces to form a strong national democratic united front. Nosaka emphasized that the central demand of the Japanese people next year, as in the past year, will be the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."
    Nosaka emphasized that the democratic forces must recognize the essence of the two enemies of the Japanese people—U.S. imperialism and Japanese monopoly capital—more clearly than in the past. Nosaka said: "The activities of the National Council Against the Security Treaty throughout Japan should continue until the treaty is abolished." Nosaka said that the Japanese Communist Party will make special efforts next year to unite the labor front and organize the unorganized farmers.
    Speaking on the China issue, Nosaka said that the Japanese people must carry out a broad and vigorous struggle to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China.
    Nosaka concluded: "Next year, we will hold our Eighth National Congress. At the 1961 Congress, we will adopt the party's program and the policy of increasing the number of party members to hundreds of thousands. The Communist Party should rapidly grow into a truly revolutionary mass party."
    Eda Saburo, Acting Chairman of the Socialist Party, emphasized in an article reviewing 1960 that next year should be the year for Japan to achieve neutrality. He wrote that the first step for Japan to become a neutral country is to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China. Eda stated that the Socialist Party will organize a powerful movement against the Ikeda Cabinet.
    Ota Kaoru, Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), said in an article written for the magazine "Sohyo," "The power currently accumulated among Japanese workers and ordinary people is unprecedentedly huge in the history of the Japanese labor movement and social movement." As long as workers can fully exert these forces, the spring struggle we are about to launch will definitely be successful.
    Nomiizo Masaru, Chairman of the All-Japan Farmers Association, said that the primary task of various farmers' associations next year is to establish a solid worker-peasant alliance based on the cooperation between workers and peasants developed in the anti-"Security Treaty" movement. He said that this will be the most effective way to smash the Ikeda Cabinet's vicious agricultural policy of reducing the agricultural population by 60%.
    Yanagida Kenjuro, Representative Committee Member of the Japan Peace Committee, said that 1961 will be a year full of hope for victory. He also said: "For eleven years, the Japanese peace movement has been accumulating power, and it is expected that this accumulated power will be fully expressed next year." Yanagida Kenjuro pointed out that the imperialists' struggle to restore their lost positions is doomed to failure. He said: "The more the imperialists struggle, the more fully their essence will be exposed to hundreds of millions of people around the world."
    Kazami Akira, Director-General of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, stated that the National Council will launch a powerful mass movement next year to restore Japan-China diplomatic relations on the basis of the three political principles of Japan-China relations. Kazami Akira emphasized that the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and the Ikeda Cabinet to create "two Chinas" must be crushed.
    Suzuki Kazuo, Director-General of the Japan-China Trade Promotion Association, emphasized that, in the wake of the economic crisis in the United States, the task of changing the Japanese national economy from a state of dependence on the United States to an independent economy will become increasingly important next year. Suzuki said, "The domestic and international situation is conducive to Japan completing this process of economic change."
    Nakajima Kenzo, Representative Committee Member of the Japan Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, pointed out that 1960 was the year when the Japanese people finally clearly realized that they must closely cooperate with the Afro-Asian people and struggle against U.S. imperialism. Nakajima emphasized that if the strength of the Japanese people is united with the strength of all the people of the world, the Japanese people will be able to open up a bright future for themselves.

    日本进步政党团体领袖展望新年表示决心
    积蓄人民力量争取和平中立
    野坂说人民的中心要求仍是废除日美条约
    据新华社29日讯　东京消息：日本共产党、社会党和各界团体领袖在回顾1960年日本人民斗争的成就时一致表示，决心在新的一年中加强反对美帝国主义及其代理人的斗争为争取日本的独立、民主、和平、中立作出更大的贡献。
    各进步政党和群众团体的领导人是在向日本记者发表谈话和在报刊上发表的文章中表示他们的战斗决心的。
    日本共产党主席野坂参三对记者说，日本共产党明年所面临的任务是作出一切努力，组织人民争取实现他们各种要求的斗争，并克服民主力量内部的弱点来组成强大的民族民主统一战线。野坂强调，明年日本人民的中心要求，像在即将过去的一年中一样，将是废除日美“安全条约”。
    野坂强调，民主力量必须比过去更加清楚地认清日本人民的两个敌人——美帝国主义和日本垄断资本的本质。野坂说：“全日本各地反对安全条约国民会议的活动应当继续进行，直到这个条约被废除为止。”野坂说，日本共产党将在明年特别努力来使劳工阵线团结一致，并把没有参加组织的农民组织起来。
    野坂在谈到中国问题时说，日本人民必须进行广泛的强有力的斗争，争取恢复日中邦交。
    野坂最后说：“明年我们将召开第八次全国代表大会，我们将在1961年的代表大会上通过党的纲领和使党员增加到几十万人的方针。共产党应当迅速地成长为一个真正的革命的群众性政党。”
    社会党代理委员长江田三郎在一篇回顾1960年的文章中强调说，明年应当是日本实现中立的一年。他写道，日本成为中立国家的第一步就是恢复日本同中国的外交关系。江田表示，社会党要组织反对池田内阁的强大运动。
    日本工会总评议会议长太田熏在为《总评》杂志所写的一篇文章中说，“目前在日本工人和普通人民中间积累起来的力量，在日本的劳工运动和社会运动史上是空前巨大的”。只要工人能够充分发挥这些力量，我们将要发动的春季斗争是一定会成功的。
    全日本农民协会联合会会长野沟胜说，各农民协会在明年的首要任务是，在反对“安全条约”运动过程中得到发展的工人和农民之间的合作的基础上，建立巩固的工农联盟。他说，这将是粉碎池田内阁要把农业人口减少60％这一恶毒的农业政策的最有效的办法。
    日本和平委员会代表委员柳田谦十郎说，1961年将是充满着胜利希望的一年。他还说：“十一年来，日本的和平运动一直在积蓄力量，预料这种积蓄的力量明年将充分表现出来。”柳田谦十郎指出，帝国主义要想恢复它们已经失去的阵地的挣扎是注定要失败的。他说：“帝国主义愈挣扎，它们的本质将更充分地暴露在全世界亿万人民的面前。”
    恢复日中邦交国民会议理事长风见章表示，国民会议明年将展开强大的群众运动，争取在日中关系三项政治原则的基础上恢复日中邦交。风见章强调必须粉碎美帝国主义和池田内阁制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
    日中贸易协进会理事长铃木一雄强调说，在美国发生经济危机后，明年把日本国民经济从依赖美国的状况改变为独立经济的任务，将变得越来越重要了。铃木说，“国内外的形势有利于日本完成这一经济变化的过程。”
    日本亚非团结委员会代表委员中岛健藏指出，1960年是日本人民终于清楚地认识到他们必须同亚非人民密切合作、同美帝国主义进行斗争的一年。中岛强调说，如果日本人民的力量同世界全体人民的力量联合起来，日本人民就能够为自己的未来打开光明的前景。
