	Shuangfeng Commune Launches "Good Captain" Movement
	In order to improve the leadership level of production teams, the Shuangfeng Commune Party Committee in Xichong County, Sichuan Province, launched a "Good Captain" movement among cadres throughout the commune. They used adherence to the Party's guidelines and policies, adherence to the "Four Togethers" (living, eating, working, and studying together with the masses), caring for the lives of the masses, and playing an exemplary leading role as the main criteria for evaluation. At the same time, they adopted methods such as phased rotational training, sending good captains to backward teams to impart experience, and organizing cadres from backward teams to study in advanced teams to widely exchange experiences in being a good production team leader, so as to learn from each other's strengths and make common progress.
	Driven by the "Good Captain" movement, the policy and ideological level and leadership level of team cadres have been improved.
	Reform of Earth Rollers and Earth Mills Saves a Lot of Human and Animal Power
	Wangkui County, Heilongjiang Province, reformed earth rollers and earth mills, changing manual traction to animal-powered traction or winch-speed-change semi-mechanized rolling and grinding, saving a large amount of labor. Originally, each earth roller and earth mill could only process 400 jin of grain per day. After being changed to semi-mechanized rolling and grinding, each machine can process 2,400 jin per day, increasing efficiency by five times. Now, about 40% of the management areas in the county have realized semi-mechanized rice making, and about 45% of the management areas have realized semi-mechanized cornmeal grinding. From March to October, a total of more than 133,000 man-days and more than 234,000 animal-days were saved, enriching the front line of agricultural production.
	Xincheng Commune's Mechanization Pilot Project is Doing Well
	The agricultural machinery mechanization and serialization pilot project of the Luhua and Tongzhuang brigades of Xincheng People's Commune in Yinchuan City, Ningxia, has been established for more than half a year. Starting from agricultural work that occupies a lot of labor, has a large workload, low efficiency, is relatively common in production, and is highly seasonal, more than 30 kinds of mechanized and semi-mechanized agricultural tools have been created, imitated, and reformed. The pilot project has initially achieved mechanized field operations (plowing, harrowing, sowing, ditching), semi-mechanized field operations (plowing, harrowing, sowing, harvesting), electric rope traction, agricultural and sideline product processing, and semi-mechanization of cooking tools. In production practice, this pilot project compares the original agricultural tools of the two brigades, and improves the shape while finalizing the design and promotion, changing one piece, testing one piece, and using one piece to support current production.
	Wuxiang County Promotes the Experience of Yimen Canteens Throughout the County
	The Wuxiang County Party Committee of Shanxi Province decided to launch a mass movement to learn from Yimen, catch up with Yimen, and run public canteens well in the county's 1,062 rural canteens, so that the Yimen canteen experience can blossom and bear fruit throughout the county.
	The Yimen Canteen in the Yimen Management Area of ​​Wuxiang Yongquan Commune, due to good planning, good management, good system, and a solid foundation, has ensured that members are satisfied with their meals and has grain reserves despite the severe disaster this year. (See page 2 of this newspaper on November 20)
	Jiangdong Commune Plants Sugarcane in Winter
	The production brigades of Jiangdong People's Commune in Chao'an County, Guangdong Province, which is famous for its high sugarcane yield, have conscientiously summarized the experience of successful sugarcane winter planting experiments in the past three years and are comprehensively promoting the sugarcane winter planting method.
	Winter-planted sugarcane has stronger tillering power, faster growth, earlier maturity, thicker stems, larger sugarcane feet, stronger disaster resistance, and is resistant to drought, cold, and wind and rain. Winter-planted sugarcane generally yields 4,000 to 5,000 jin more per mu than spring-planted sugarcane, and produces 200 to 300 jin more sugar. Moreover, because winter-planted sugarcane is planted and matures earlier, it is also conducive to expanding the summer planting area and adjusting the uneven distribution of labor in winter and spring.

    要闻快报
    双凤公社开展“好队长”运动
    四川西充县双凤公社党委为了提高生产队的领导水平，在全社干部中开展了一个“好队长”运动。他们把按照党的方针政策办事、坚持“四同”、关心群众生活和起模范带头作用等条件，作为评比的主要内容。同时采取分期分批轮训、派好队长到落后队传授经验、组织落后队的干部到先进队留学等方式，广泛交流当好生产队长的经验，达到取长补短、共同提高的目的。
    在“好队长”运动推动下，队干部的政策思想水平和领导水平都有了提高。
    改革土碾土磨节约大量人畜力
    黑龙江望奎县改革土碾土磨，变人力牵引为畜力牵引或绞关变速等半机械化的碾磨，节省出大量的劳动力。原来每盘土碾土磨每天只能加工四百斤粮食，改成半机械化的碾磨后，每台每天可加工两千四百斤，效率提高五倍。现在全县有40％左右的管理区实现制米半机械化，有45％左右的管理区实现磨玉米面半机械化。从3月到10月，共节省出人工十三万三千多个，畜工二十三万四千多个，充实了农业生产第一线。
    新城公社机械化试点搞得好
    宁夏银川市新城人民公社芦花和同庄两个大队的农业机具机械化、系列化试点，建立半年多来，从占用劳动力多、工作量大、工效低、生产较普遍、而且季节性强的农活着手，共创制、仿制、改制各种机械化、半机械化的农具三十多种。初步实现机械化田间作业（耕、耙、播、开沟）、半机械化田间作业（耕、耙、播、收）、电动绳索牵引、农副产品加工和炊事工具半机械化一条龙。这个试点在生产实践中，对两个大队原有的农具进行排队比较，以边改进造型、边定型推广的方法，改一件，试一件，用一件，支援了当前的生产。
    武乡全县推广义门食堂经验
    山西武乡县委决定在全县一千零六十二个农村食堂中，开展一个学义门、赶义门，办好公共食堂的群众运动，使义门食堂经验在全县开花结果。
    义门食堂在武乡涌泉公社义门管理区，由于计划好、管理好、制度好、家底厚，虽然今年灾情严重，仍保证社员吃得满意，还有储备粮。（见本报11月20日二版）
    江东公社冬植甘蔗
    以甘蔗高产著名的广东潮安县江东人民公社各生产大队，认真总结了三年来试验成功的甘蔗冬植经验，全面推行甘蔗冬植法。
    冬植蔗比春植蔗分蘖力强，生长快，成熟早，茎粗蔗脚大，抗灾力强，耐旱、耐寒、耐风雨。冬植蔗每亩一般要比春植蔗多产四千至五千斤，多榨糖二百至三百斤。而且，由于冬植蔗早种早熟，还有利于扩大夏种面积以及调节冬春劳力忙闲不均的现象。
