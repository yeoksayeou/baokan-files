    Visiting the Hero of the Republic – Ji Queshi
    Zhao Yang
    The Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea recently awarded the title of Hero of the Republic to four outstanding leaders of the Chollima work teams, and Comrade Ji Queshi is one of them.
    Comrade Ji Queshi is a worker in the No. 1 workshop of the Pyongyang Silk Reeling Factory. She grew up in a mountain valley and is only twenty-four years old this year. In terms of education, she has not even finished elementary school. However, she cultivated two Chollima work teams in less than a year.
    I visited this hero with admiration. She is a slightly plump girl of short stature with a round face, wearing a short white gauze top and a long black gauze skirt, with a short, thick braid. She gives the impression of being simple and honest. Three medals hang on her chest—a Gold Star Medal and two Chollima Work Team Medals—marking the party and the country's full evaluation of her work.
    Continuously Improving Oneself
    Comrade Ji Queshi entered the Pyongyang Silk Reeling Factory on October 4, 1955, as a worker. Due to her low level of education, she needed to learn everything. She set two rules for herself: one was to accept the leadership of the Party and the Youth League; the other was to work hard to learn technology. As a result, she made rapid progress, improving her skills by two grades each year. By the end of 1958, she had become a skilled seventh-grade worker (the highest grade). In October of the same year, she was promoted to work team leader. This team had forty-eight workers, with an average seniority of four years, including some female workers with ten years of experience. She felt that she was young and had difficulty leading older workers, and she felt somewhat timid in her mind. But when she thought that the leadership wanted her to be the team leader because they believed she could do a good job, she felt very honored and gained confidence. At this time, she set two more rules for herself: one was to work hard to learn leadership methods; the other was to take the initiative to ask the Party, the Youth League, and the trade union for instructions when some problems could not be solved. Thanks to her unremitting efforts and the key assistance of the factory leadership, this work team, which was originally "middle-of-the-road" in its work, joined the Chollima Work Team movement on May 9, 1959, and won the title of Chollima Work Team on July 8 of the same year. She got along very well with the comrades in the team. Everyone even talked to her about trivial family matters, and some comrades even showed her letters written by their loved ones. The older female workers also respected her very much when they saw that she had made achievements in her work.
  Going to the Most Backward Work Team to Work
    After gaining the glorious title of Chollima Work Team, Ji Queshi was praised everywhere. However, she was not satisfied with this. She often thought of Premier Kim Il-sung's teaching: what we emphasize is not to limit the innovation movement to one or a few people, but to need many people to expand the ranks of innovators. Whenever she heard workers who failed to complete their plans being criticized, she felt very sad. She thought of Premier Kim Il-sung's words and the stories of guerrillas fighting against difficulties, and felt that she had a responsibility to go to the most backward work teams to help them progress, even though she knew that working there would be more laborious and the income would be reduced. But did participating in the Chollima Work Team movement mean working less and earning more? So, at a factory-wide conference, she was the first to speak, asking the leadership to send her to work in those teams that failed to complete their plans. This request was supported by the Party committee, and she chose the most backward work team—the fifth work team of the first silk reeling workshop. This team had seventy-two people, and its characteristics were that there were many new workers, with an average seniority of less than one year, poor labor discipline, and the machines were assembled from waste products, and they often failed to complete their production tasks. The best month only completed 70% of the plan, and the attendance rate never exceeded 78%. The situation was very bad. However, all this did not scare Comrade Ji Queshi, and she began her arduous work from then on.
    Using Practical Actions to Influence Them
    She believed that the first thing to do was to raise the consciousness of the comrades in the team so that they could consciously engage in productive labor. So she strengthened her contact with the trade union group leader and the core members of the team, and she took charge of the political and ideological work in the team, and began to patiently explain the Party's policies and carry out education in revolutionary traditions to the new workers. But, to her surprise, they ironically said: "You are the leader of the Chollima Work Team, and we are backward elements." Some people walked away without speaking to her when they saw her. This made her very uncomfortable. She thought that there must be shortcomings in her work methods, so she made a concrete analysis of the workers in the team, preparing to carry out various forms of activities based on the actual ideological situation of the workers. On the one hand, she mobilized the Youth League and trade union cadres to go to understand and help the comrades in the team, and on the other hand, she used her own practical actions to influence them. The dormitory was very dirty, and Ji Queshi cleaned it every day. At first, they thought this was right, but as the days passed, they gradually felt embarrassed. They said, "Comrade Team Leader, let us sweep it." Some workers pretended to be sick, and she asked the doctor to diagnose them. This made them feel guilty and also feel the warmth between comrades. Some workers did not know how to live, so she helped them wash clothes, iron clothes, and save money when they received their wages, and arrange their lives in a planned way. Some workers liked to watch movies and dramas, so she organized them to watch educational movies and dramas. In this way, the relationship between comrades became better day by day, and everyone thought she was a good team leader.
    Transforming Her
    There was a girl in the team named Jin, who was relatively pretty and also very vain. But she had just entered the factory in October last year, and her skills were low and her wages were low, which could not satisfy her desire for vanity. So when she saw others making new clothes, she secretly took them and wore them to play. The workers all hated her, and her mother could not control her, saying that she would let the factory handle it. All the workers in the factory demanded that she be expelled, but Comrade Ji Queshi was determined to transform her. She thought, if she is expelled, where will she go? Unless she goes to South Korea, otherwise, we have a responsibility to transform her. She made a very long pillow and a very large quilt and slept with her. Others said she was cultivating a thief, and some suspected that she had also become a loafer. She was afraid that the organization would not trust her, so she went to the Party committee. The Party committee supported her opinion. In order to help her progress, Ji Queshi went to her home fifteen times, visited forty-six people who were connected with her, and learned about her situation. Not only did she help her in the team, but she also mobilized the people around her to help her. Later, she found that she had been a wall newspaper editor, so she recommended her to be a factory newspaper correspondent. This work was very educational for her, making her feel her past mistakes and also feel the trust of her comrades. She was determined to reform and began to work hard. After more than four months of help, her skills improved from the second grade to the fourth grade, she was able to manage her life, and she also started saving money, and finally became an activist in the team.
  Ji Queshi had cried many times when she ran into setbacks in her work, but Premier Kim Il-sung's teachings and the image of the guerrillas encouraged her to continue moving forward. She finally succeeded. In December 1959, this most backward team completed the production plan for the first time with a 2% overfulfillment. In January of this year, it completed the production plan with a 40% overfulfillment. The attendance rate reached 100%. The situation in this team has completely changed.
    For Communism
    During the "March 8" International Women's Day this year, Premier Kim Il-sung specially received Comrade Ji Queshi, listened to her report in detail, and gave a high evaluation of her deeds of helping the backward catch up with the advanced, praising her as a true communist and hoping that their team would win the title of Chollima Work Team before the "May 1" Labor Day. Comrade Ji Queshi did not disappoint Premier Kim Il-sung's expectations. She conveyed Premier Kim Il-sung's teachings to all the comrades in the team. Everyone was more motivated to produce, and mutual assistance between comrades became a trend, and they were more united. Finally, they won this glorious title ahead of schedule on April 18. However, Comrade Ji Queshi was still not satisfied. She was determined to strive for her team to win the title of double Chollima Work Team before the "May 1" Labor Day next year, and at the same time help four other teams become Chollima Work Teams. In order to achieve this goal, the entire team is participating in the Workers' Middle School (junior high school) and has also linked up with Kim Chaek University. With their help, they are constantly improving their technical level.
    "Of course, our purpose is not to strive for the title, but for communism," said this young girl, like a mature politician, never losing her way. She truly deserves to be a hero of the Republic and a communist fighter.
    Last year, during our National Day's tenth anniversary, Comrade Ji Queshi came to China as a member of the Korean working people's delegation. She asked the reporter to say hello to the Chinese workers and hoped to exchange experiences between the two countries through the newspaper. (Attached picture)

    访共和国英雄——吉确实
    赵扬
    朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会最近授予四个杰出的千里马作业班班长以共和国英雄的称号，吉确实同志就是其中的一个。
    吉确实同志是平壤缫丝厂第一车间的工人。她生长在山沟里，今年才二十四岁，论文化小学还没有念完，然而她却在不到一年的时间里培养出了两个千里马作业班。
    我怀着敬佩的心情去访问这位英雄。她是一个身材不高而略略有些胖的姑娘，圆圆的脸庞，穿着一件白纱的短上衣和一条黑纱的长裙，梳着一条短而粗的辫子，给人的印象是朴素而淳厚。她的胸前挂着三枚奖章——一枚金星奖章和两枚千里马作业班奖章——标志着党和国家对她的工作的全部评价。
    不断提高自己
    吉确实同志是1955年10月4日进平壤缫丝厂当工人的。由于文化水平低，什么都需要学，她替自己规定了两条：一条是接受党团领导；另一条是努力学习技术。这样做的结果，进步很快，技术每年提升二级，到1958年底，她已成为一个技术熟练的七级工（最高级）了。同年10月，她被提升为作业班长。这个班有四十八个工人，平均工龄为四年，也有十年工龄的女工。她感到自己年纪轻，领导老工人有困难，思想上有些畏缩。但一想到领导上要自己做班长，是相信自己能把工作搞好，感到十分光荣，于是就有了信心。这时她又为自己规定两条：一是努力学习领导方法；二是有些问题解决不了，主动向党、团、工会请示。由于她的不懈努力和工厂领导上的重点帮助，这个本来工作上是“中游”的作业班，在1959年5月9日参加了千里马作业班运动，并于同年7月8日荣获千里马作业班称号。她和班里的同志相处得非常好，大家连家庭琐事都给她谈，有的同志把爱人写来的信也给她看。年纪大的女工看她工作做出了成绩，也都非常尊敬她。
  到最落后的作业班去工作
    获得光荣的千里马作业班称号后，吉确实到处受到表扬。然而她并不以此为满足。她经常想起金日成首相的教导：我们所强调的不是把革新运动局限在一个人或几个人，而是需要许多人，使革新者的队伍更加扩大。每当她听到那些完不成计划的工人受到批评时，心里就非常难过。她想起了金日成首相的话，想起了游击队员向困难作斗争的故事，觉得自己有责任到最落后的作业班去帮助她们进步，虽然她也知道到那里去劳动费力气，收入却会减少。但是参加千里马作业班运动难道是为了少作活多挣钱吗？于是在一次工厂召开的大会上，她第一个发言，要求领导上派她到那些完不成计划的班里去工作。这个要求得到党委的支持，她就选了一个最落后的作业班——第一缫丝车间第五作业班。这个班有七十二个人，它的特点是新工人多，平均工龄不到一年，劳动纪律不好，机器也是用废品装配起来的，经常完不成生产任务。最好的月份只完成计划的70％，出勤率从来没有超过78％，情况非常糟糕。但是，这一切并没有吓倒吉确实同志，她从此开始了艰巨的工作。
    用实际行动去感化她们
    她认为首先要提高班里同志的觉悟，使她们能够自觉地进行生产劳动，于是她加强了同工会组长和班里核心分子的联系，自己分工负责班里的政治思想工作，开始耐心地向新工人解释党的政策和进行革命传统的教育。但是，出她意外，她们反而讽刺地说：“你是千里马作业班班长，我们是落后分子”。有的人见了她不讲话就走开了。这使她非常难受。她想，定是自己的工作方法有缺点，于是她对班里的工人进行了具体的分析，准备从工人的实际思想情况出发，进行各种方式的活动。她一面动员团和工会干部分头去了解和帮助班里的同志，一面用自己的实际行动去感化她们。宿舍非常脏，吉确实天天打扫。起初，她们认为这是应该的，日子久了，她们慢慢感到不好意思起来，她们说：“班长同志，我们来扫吧。”有的工人装病，她就请医生给她们诊断。这样一来，使她们受到良心上的责备，也感到同志间的温暖。有的工人不会过生活，她就帮助她们洗衣服，熨衣服，发工资时帮助她们储蓄，有计划地安排生活。有的工人爱看电影和戏剧，她就组织她们看有教育意义的电影和戏剧。这样，同志间的关系就一天天好起来，大家都认为她是个好班长。
    把她改造过来
    班里有一个姓金的姑娘，人长得比较清秀，也非常爱虚荣。但她去年10月刚进厂，技术低、工资少，满足不了她爱虚荣的欲望。于是她看到别人做了新衣服，就偷偷地拿来自己穿着去玩。工人们都恨她，她母亲也管不了她，说听厂里处理吧。全厂工人都要求把她开除，吉确实同志却下定决心要把她改造过来。她想，把她开除，她到哪儿去呢？除非到南朝鲜去，否则，我们就有责任改造她。她做了一个很长的枕头和很大的被子和她睡在一起，别人说她在培养小偷，有人怀疑她也变成了二流子了。她恐怕组织上也不信任她，就找到党委。党委支持她的意见。为了帮助她进步，吉确实到她家住的地方去了十五次，访问了四十六个和她有联系的人，了解她的情况。不仅自己在班里帮助她，而且动员她周围的人也一起来帮助她。后来发现她当过墙报编辑，就推荐她当厂报通讯员。这个工作对她很起教育作用，使她感到自己过去的错误，也感到同志们对她的信任。她决心改过，并且开始好好地劳动了。经过四个多月的帮助，她的技术由二级提高到四级，自己能管理生活，还开始了储蓄，终于成为班里的积极分子。
  吉确实在工作中碰钉子的时候，也哭过很多次，但是金日成首相的教导和游击队员的形象在鼓舞着她继续前进。她终于成功了。1959年12月，这个最落后的班第一次超额2％完成了生产计划。今年1月，超额40％完成了生产计划。出勤率达到百分之百。这个班的情况完全变样了。
    为了共产主义
    今年“三八”节时，金日成首相特地接见了吉确实同志，详细听取了她的汇报，对她帮助落后赶上先进的事迹给予很高的评价，称誉她是个真正的共产主义者，希望她们的班能在
  “五一”节前争得千里马作业班称号。吉确实同志没有辜负金日成首相的期望，她把金日成首相的教导向全班同志进行了传达，大家生产的劲头更足了，同志之间互相帮助成了风气，团结得更紧了。终于，她们在4月18日提前获得了这个光荣的称号。但是，吉确实同志还不满足，她决心要在明年
  “五一”节前争取自己这个班获得双重千里马作业班的称号，同时还帮助其他四个班成为千里马作业班。为着实现这个目标，她们全班参加劳动者中学（初中）读书，并和金策大学挂上了钩，在他们的帮助下，不断提高自己的技术水平。
    “当然，我们的目的不是为了争取称号，而是为了共产主义”，这个年轻的姑娘说，像一位成熟的政治家，永远不会迷失方向，她真不愧为共和国的英雄，共产主义的战士。
    去年我国国庆十周年时，吉确实同志作为朝鲜劳动人民代表团的成员来过中国。她要求记者向中国工人问好，并希望通过报纸交流两国的经验。（附图片）
