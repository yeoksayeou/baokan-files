Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 20th. The "Voice of Laos" radio station of the legitimate Lao government today published a commentary saying that the method of convening a conference of the participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference is very correct, and it expressed the hope that this conference can be convened as soon as possible.

The commentary said that in order to maintain peace in Laos and Southeast Asia, the countries concerned in the Geneva Agreement, Southeast Asian countries, and peace-loving people of the world must take effective measures to stop the actions of US imperialism and its running dogs in their aggression against Laos.

The commentary said that the 1954 Geneva Agreement on the Lao issue is the international legal basis for recognizing the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Laos. The Geneva Agreement stipulates that Laos must not join any military blocs, foreign military personnel, weapons, and military supplies are prohibited from entering Laos, and foreign countries are prohibited from establishing military bases on Lao territory. In order to strictly and fully implement the above-mentioned resolutions, the co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference and the International Commission for Laos have the responsibility to monitor and supervise the implementation of the Geneva Agreement on the Lao issue until the political issues of Indochina are completely resolved.

The commentary pointed out that, however, the vicious conspiracy of US imperialism is to turn Laos into its colony and make Laos one of its military bases in the Southeast Asian region. For six years, US imperialism has used its military "aid" and its running dogs in Laos and in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization aggression bloc to continuously undermine the legal basis of the Geneva Agreement on the Lao issue. And now, US imperialism, the Thai reactionaries, and other reactionary forces collude with the Lao traitorous clique, and even more blatantly directly invade Laos, conspiring to overthrow the legitimate Lao government and establish a puppet government, in order to use the puppet government as a tool to realize their above-mentioned conspiracy.

The commentary pointed out that the direct aggression against Laos by US imperialism and the Thai reactionary forces and other reactionary groups in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization aggression bloc has made the situation in Laos very serious. The war launched by US imperialism in Laos threatens peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia. The commentary pointed out that in the current situation, the method of reconvening the conference of participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference on the issue of restoring peace in Indochina is very correct, and it conforms to the spirit and content of the Geneva Agreement.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 18th. According to a broadcast by the Lao Legitimate Government Radio Station today: Captain Kong Le, Chairman of the Lao Coup Committee and Garrison Commander of Vientiane, issued a statement on the 16th, sternly condemning the blatant aggression against Laos by US imperialism, Thailand, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, the Philippines, and the South Vietnamese reactionary forces, and solemnly declared: "The Lao Royal Government, with Prince Souvanna Phouma as Prime Minister, will resolutely fight to eliminate the US and Thai running dogs, the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique, resolutely oppose the blatant interference of the United States and its servants, and lead the people and the Royal Armed Forces to fight resolutely for final victory." In the statement, Kong Le pointed out: "Just as the Lao government, troops, and people are fighting resolutely to defend the capital Vientiane against the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique, running dogs of US imperialism, US imperialism and its servants have blatantly invaded Laos, causing serious damage to the people of Vientiane. Recently, US imperialism has continuously transported many tanks and artillery pieces to the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique, and airdropped many weapons, ammunition, and war materials for them to attack Vientiane. In the Battle of Vientiane, some shells were fired from the US agencies stationed in Vientiane, and these US agencies have also become the bunkers and fortresses for the traitorous clique's troops and tanks."

Kong Le pointed out: "Thai reactionary forces have also dispatched troops to land in Vientiane to reinforce the Phoumi rebels, and at the same time, they have shelled Vientiane from Thai territory, causing serious damage to the people of Vientiane. US imperialism, Thailand, the Philippines, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and the South Vietnamese reactionary forces have sent many personnel to Vientiane to help the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique attack the government forces in the capital, Vientiane."

Kong Le said: "In the name of the Chairman of the Coup Committee and Garrison Commander of Vientiane, I solemnly condemn and resolutely oppose the interference and aggression against Laos by US imperialism, Thailand, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, the Philippines, and the South Vietnamese reactionary forces." Kong Le demanded an immediate end to the above-mentioned actions, and pointed out that US imperialism and its servants must "bear full responsibility" for the consequences caused by their actions.

Kong Le said: "In the current situation, the Lao people and the Royal Armed Forces hereby appeal to the peace-loving governments and people of the world to support the Lao people's struggle for the independence, peace, and neutrality of Laos."

    《老挝之声》电台要求召开日内瓦会议参加国会议
    制止美国侵略保障印度支那和平
    贡勒大尉说老挝爱国军民决心为反对叛国集团斗争到底
    新华社河内20日电　老挝合法政府的《老挝之声》电台今天发表评论说，关于召开1954年日内瓦会议参与国会议的办法是非常正确的，它表示希望这个会议能尽快召开。
    评论说，为了维护老挝和东南亚地区的和平，日内瓦协议有关各国、东南亚各国和世界爱好和平人民必须采取有效措施，制止美帝国主义及其走狗侵略老挝的行动。
    评论说，1954年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议是承认老挝的独立、主权和领土完整的国际的法理基础。日内瓦协议规定，老挝不得加入任何军事集团，禁止外国军事人员和武器、军用物资输入老挝，禁止外国在老挝领土上建立军事基地。为了严正和充分履行上述决议，日内瓦会议主席国和老挝国际委员会有责任监察和监督关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的履行，直到印度支那的政治问题获得完全解决的时候为止。
    评论指出，但是，美帝国主义的恶毒阴谋是：把老挝变成它的殖民地，并使老挝成为它在东南亚地区的军事基地之一。六年来，美帝国主义利用它的军事“援助”和它在老挝的、以及东南亚条约组织侵略集团中的走狗，不断地破坏关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的法理基础。而现在，美帝国主义、泰国反动集团以及其他反动势力勾结老挝叛国集团，更明目张胆地直接侵略老挝，阴谋推翻老挝合法政府，成立傀儡政府，以便利用傀儡政府作为实现它们上述阴谋的工具。
    评论指出，美帝国主义和东南亚条约组织侵略集团中的泰国反动势力和其他反动集团对老挝的直接侵略，使老挝局势变得非常严重。美帝国主义在老挝发动的战争，威胁了印度支那和东南亚地区的和平。评论指出，在目前情况下，重新召开1954年关于恢复印度支那和平问题的日内瓦会议参加国会议的办法是非常正确的，它符合日内瓦协议的精神和内容。
    新华社河内18日电　据老挝合法政府广播电台今天广播：老挝政变委员会主席、万象卫戍司令贡勒大尉在16日发表声明，严正谴责美帝国主义、泰国、蒋介石集团、菲律宾和南越反动势力明目张胆地侵略老挝的行动，并且郑重宣布：“以梭发那·富马亲王作首相的老挝王国政府，将为消灭美国和泰国的走狗富米—文翁叛国集团、坚决反对美国及其仆从明目张胆的干涉，而领导人民和王国军队坚决斗争，争取最后胜利”。贡勒在声明中指出：“正当老挝政府、部队和人民为了反对美帝国主义的走狗富米—文翁叛国集团，以保卫首都万象而坚决斗争的时候，美帝国主义及其仆从竟然明目张胆地侵略老挝，给万象人民造成了严重损失。最近，美帝国主义不断地运给富米—文翁叛国集团许多坦克、大炮，并空投许多武器、弹药和战争物资，让它们进攻万象。在万象战斗中，有的炮弹从美国驻万象的机关里射出，美国的这些机关还成了叛国集团的军队和坦克的掩体和堡垒。”
    贡勒指出：“泰国反动势力也调兵在万象登陆，以增援富米叛军，同时它还从泰国境内炮击万象，使万象人民受到严重损失。美帝国主义、泰国、菲律宾、蒋介石集团和南越反动势力派遣许多人员到万象，帮助富米—文翁叛国集团进攻首都万象的政府军。”
    贡勒说：“我谨以政变委员会主席、万象卫戍司令的名义，严厉谴责和坚决反对美帝国主义、泰国、蒋介石集团、菲律宾和南越反动势力对老挝的干涉和侵略。”贡勒要求立即停止上述行动，并且指出，美帝国主义及其仆从必须对它们的行动所造成的后果“担负完全责任。”
    贡勒说：“在当前局势下，老挝人民和王国军队谨呼吁世界爱好和平的政府和人民支持老挝人民为了老挝的独立、和平和中立所进行的斗争。”
