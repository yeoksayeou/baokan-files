    The Good Captain of the Hani People – Feng Zhengde
    Ji Wangming
    Feng Zhengde, a Hani cadre and Communist Party member from Mojiang County, Yunnan Province, returned to his hometown to engage in production for three years, leading ethnic minority commune members in water management and land improvement, resulting in consecutive years of increased grain production. The Xiacaoyuan production team of the Bixi Commune, originally a backward production team, has now been transformed into an advanced production team.

    Feng Zhengde was a poor peasant. After the land reform, he left his hometown to work in the county committee's rural work department and later studied at the prefectural party school for two years. In the winter of 1957, the county committee, in order to strengthen rural work, transferred him back home to participate in production. He happily returned to his hometown with his bedding roll. The Hani commune members welcomed him, saying, "Our mountain valley has another Hani person who understands Chairman Mao's principles!"

    Feng Zhengde's hometown is in a canyon in the Ailao Mountains. The climate is relatively mild, and double-cropping rice is possible. However, due to water scarcity, even planting a single crop of rice is difficult. The Hani people always irrigate the fields with winter water in one year and save it for transplanting seedlings the next year. In 1958, Mojiang County experienced a severe drought unprecedented in decades. The fields were so dry that they cracked, and people worked day and night to draw water for drought resistance, but the cracks still wouldn't close. The seedlings were on the verge of dying from drought, while the Mojiang River flowed downstream in vain beside the fields. The river was only three or four feet lower than the paddy fields, but there was no way to get the water into the fields. While Feng Zhengde and the commune members were drawing water, he thought: How great it would be if we could build a small dam to raise the river water. Hani elder Luo Zhangde said, "During a severe drought in the Qing Dynasty, we wanted to build a dam, but we didn't know how to build it or where to build it." Feng Zhengde was determined to work with his fellow villagers to build a dam on the Mojiang River.

    Feng Zhengde borrowed a level from the county agricultural and water conservancy department, surveyed the dam site and the route of the canal, and led the commune members to start working. However, the first dam they built could not withstand the scouring. Feng Zhengde called a meeting of commune members to discuss the issue, and the commune members came up with many good ideas. So Feng Zhengde led the commune members again, according to the methods jointly studied by everyone, cutting trees for stakes, weaving bamboo cages, scooping pebbles and sand from the river to fill the bamboo cages, and then stacking these bamboo cages horizontally on the riverbed, installing long bamboo fences inside and outside, and planting large tree stumps, building a solid dam foundation. It took only over two hundred workdays to build this dam. At the time of the severest drought, the river water flowed into the fields, saving the dying seedlings. Later, Feng Zhengde led the commune members to build a similar small dam and two irrigation canals on the Hexi Xiaohe River, and more than 300 mu of fields in the entire team were transformed into water-saturated fields. People no longer had to draw water for drought resistance. With water, the commune members changed from single-cropping rice to double-cropping rice, and the seven mu of double-cropping rice trial-planted last year were all successful. This year, the area of double-cropping rice has increased to sixty-three mu, with a total output of more than 25,000 jin, accounting for more than double the total grain increase of the team this year.

    The process of building the Mojiang River dam gave Feng Zhengde a profound education, making him further realize that in promoting advanced measures such as water, fertilizer, and soil in ethnic minority areas, it is necessary to adapt to local conditions, fully consider the characteristics of ethnic minority areas, and respect the effective experience of ethnic minorities. If all the ethnic members had not had a strong desire to construct the dam and contributed ideas and methods it would not have been constructed so quickly. Feng Zhengde thought: Even though he is a Hani, he would still encounter setbacks if he didn't follow this principle. He was determined to participate in labor and immerse himself more deeply in the masses.

    From then on, Feng Zhengde worked with the commune members every day to go up the mountains and down to the dams to engage in production, thinking about ways to increase production. One day, while he was plowing the fields with the commune members, one commune member's ox suddenly stopped. The man whipped it, and the ox suddenly lunged forward and fell into a large hidden pit. Another time, a young man also fell into a hidden pit while transplanting seedlings. Some people didn't understand what was going on and were afraid to work in this kind of field. Feng Zhengde came to the edge of this field and saw bubbles rising from the field, slowly forming a sinkhole. The commune members told him that the soil in this field was particularly cold, and it only yielded two or three hundred jin of grain per mu, which was half the local yield. There were more than 30 mu of such fields in the entire team, accounting for more than one-tenth of the total area. Feng Zhengde thought that as long as these fields could be transformed, production would definitely increase. So he visited commune members of all ethnic groups. Some said that the land was too rotten, and it was best to abandon it and open up new fields; others said that people were lazy, and as long as they plowed and harrowed a few more times and applied more fertilizer, they didn't believe it couldn't be transformed. Feng Zhengde felt that merely plowing more was not enough, but he believed that as long as he persisted in going deep into the masses, he would definitely be able to come up with a solution. One day, he was talking to his nephew, who was an accountant, about the transformation of the sinkholes, and the accountant's mother said, "The field in the mountain gully in front of our house used to have sinkholes, and it only yielded a few gourds of grain a year; one year, I poured a lot of horse manure into it, the sinkholes disappeared, and the grain grew very well, yielding over a stone a year!" She added, "The soil is cold, and the horse manure is dry. When mixed together, the grain can grow well." These words lit up Feng Zhengde's mind. It was like searching high and low without success, only to find it effortlessly. The old sister-in-law's method might be able to increase grain yield. At this time, a leading comrade from the county committee came to his team. Feng Zhengde reported this situation and his ideas to this comrade. The county committee comrade told him that not only should he listen to the opinions of the masses, but he should also analyze them. Soil improvement should be discussed with the agricultural technology department, experimented with, and gradually promoted. This comrade sent a cadre from the agricultural technology station to study with Feng Zhengde. This technical cadre took off his shoes and observed in the field for a long time and said, "The acidity in the field is too high, and it is undergoing intense chemical changes at all times. These pits are the result of these changes. In recent years, the acidity in the field has been increasing year by year, and horse manure is no longer effective. It is best to sprinkle some lime to neutralize it." This suggestion was supported by many commune members, and some young people said, "Sprinkle it quickly. Sprinkle it on all the fields with this problem." Others said, "Lime is extremely violent. It can kill insects and ruin grass. Can the onion-like seedlings withstand it?" They fundamentally disagreed with sprinkling lime. According to the county committee's instructions, Feng Zhengde decided to experiment with a few mu first, figure out the method, and then work on it on a large scale. In the first year, Feng Zhengde led several members of the Communist Youth League to try sprinkling on three mu. In some places, the lime was sprinkled too concentrated, and the seedlings that were later transplanted were indeed burned to death; in the fields where the lime was sprinkled evenly, the temperature rose, the sinkholes disappeared, and the grain yield increased. Feng Zhengde summarized a set of experiences: the amount of lime used should be appropriate. Sprinkle more on fields with high acidity and less on fields with low acidity, and it should all be sprinkled evenly. This year, all the more than 30 mu of acidic fields in the team were sprinkled with lime according to this method. Feng Zhengde sprinkled it on his own eight mu, and all of them yielded a bumper harvest. Now, the grain has been weighed and put into storage, with an average yield of more than 800 jin per mu, more than double the yield of last year. The eight mu sprinkled by Feng Zhengde himself averaged 1,130 jin per mu. These fields increased grain production by more than 10,000 jin.

    Previously, the Hani people planted fields with sparse seedlings and sparse planting, with clumps of seedlings eight inches wide, and only about 10,000 clumps were planted per mu. Based on the soil conditions, Feng Zhengde suggested planting slightly denser. Some commune members disagreed, and most commune members didn't know whether dense planting was good or not. Feng Zhengde remembered a sentence that the county party secretary often said: Ethnic minority farmers, like Han farmers, will only believe it after they see the facts. We cadres must play a leading role. Feng Zhengde decided to conduct an experiment first and start a competition with those who advocated sparse planting. In a seven-mu field, half was planted by those who advocated sparse planting according to the old rules; the other half was planted by Feng Zhengde and several members of the Communist Youth League, with an average of 25,000 clumps planted per mu. The fertilization, weeding, and other measures for these two plots of land were the same. At first, they were both green and lush and lovable, but after the grain was bagged, the situation was different. The rice in Feng Zhengde's field had rice blast, the grain filling was very slow, and the husks were also turning black. One commune member said: This must be because it was planted too densely. At this time, an old man told Feng Zhengde to spray water soaked in crushed cypress leaves and Wujiu tree leaves, which are available everywhere locally. He and the members of the Communist Youth League sprayed the tree leaf water three times in a row. The phenomenon of blackening of the husks was suppressed, and the slurry also filled normally. As a result, Feng Zhengde's field averaged 1,030 jin per mu; the other half of the field averaged only over 700 jin per mu (both were double-cropping rice). Since then, reasonable close planting has been promoted in the team. This year, an average of about 25,000 clumps were densely planted per mu, which played a considerable role in increasing grain production.

    During the three years that Feng Zhengde has been the team leader, the production outlook of the Xiacaoyuan production team has undergone great changes. Many bad habits that hindered the development of production have been reformed, and many good habits have been formed. In the past, the Hani people didn't fertilize when planting crops. Now, they not only use green manure but also use human and animal manure. Therefore, grain production has increased year after year. In 1958, production increased by 50%, last year production increased by more than 20%, and this year production has increased by nearly 20% compared to last year.

    哈尼族的好队长——封正德
    纪旺明
    云南省墨江县哈尼族干部、共产党员封正德回乡生产三年，带领少数民族社员治水改土，粮食连续三年增产。碧溪公社的下菜园生产队原来是一个落后生产小队，现在已变成了先进生产小队。
    封正德是个贫农，土改结束以后，就离开家乡到县委农村工作部工作，后来又到地委党校学习了二年。1957年冬天，县委为了加强农村工作，调他回家参加生产，他就高高兴兴地背着铺盖卷回到了家乡。哈尼族社员都来欢迎他，说：“我们山沟里又多了一个懂毛主席道理的哈尼人！”
    封正德的家乡在哀牢山脉的一个峡谷里。气候比较温和，可以种双季稻。但由于缺水，种一季水稻也有困难。哈尼人总是在头一年灌上腊水，留到第二年栽秧。1958年，墨江县遇到了几十年没有过的大旱，田里旱得裂了缝，人们夜以继日地车水抗旱，裂缝还是合不拢来。秧苗眼看就要旱死了，而田边的墨江河却在白白地向下淌。河水只比水田矮三、四尺，就是没法流进田里来。封正德一边和社员车水，一边在想：要是修个小水坝就能把河水提上来该有多好。哈尼老人罗章德说：“清朝时有一年大旱，我们就想修个坝，就是不晓得要咋样修，修在哪里好？”封正德下决心要和乡亲们一起在墨江河上打起一道坝来。
    封正德到县农水科借来了一架水平仪，勘定了坝址和水渠的路线，就领着社员们干起来。但是第一次修起的坝经不起冲刷。封正德召集社员开会研究，社员们说出了许多好办法。于是封正德又领着社员，按照大家共同研究的办法，砍树作桩，破竹编笼，从河里涝出鹅卵石和沙土装进竹笼里，然后把这些竹笼横堆在河床上，内外安上长篾笆，再栽上大树桩，建起了稳固的坝基。修这个坝一共只花了二百多个工，在最干旱的时候使河水流进田里，拯救了快死的禾苗。以后，封正德又领着社员们在河西小河里修了同样一座小坝和两条输水渠，全队三百多亩田都变成了饱水田，人们再也不用车水抗旱了。有了水，社员们把一季稻改成了两季稻，去年试种的七亩双季稻都成功了。今年双季稻的面积增加到六十三亩，总产两万五千多斤，占今年全队粮食增产总数的一倍以上。
    修筑墨江河水坝的经过，给封正德很深刻的教育，使他进一步体会到：在少数民族地区推行水、肥、土等先进措施，必须因地制宜，充分考虑少数民族地区的特点，尊重少数民族行之有效的经验。这次修水坝要不是各族社员有迫切愿望，大家出主意想办法，就不可能这样迅速修成。封正德想：自己虽然是哈尼族，不遵守这一条也会碰壁。他决心更好地参加劳动，深入群众。
    这以后，封正德天天都和社员一起上山下坝搞生产，琢磨增产的办法。有一天他和社员在一起犁田，有个社员的牛蓦地停住了，那人抽了一鞭，这牛猛然的向前一窜，就陷进一个大暗坑里。又一回，有个青年在栽秧的时候也掉进了暗坑。有些人不明白是怎么回事，都怕到这种田里去作活。封正德来到这块田边，见田里直冒气泡，慢慢地就形成一个陷坑。社员们告诉他，这田里的水土特别冷，一亩只收得二、三百斤谷子，比当地的产量低一半。这样的田全队有三十多亩，占总面积的十分之一以上。封正德想只要能把这些田改造过来，就一定能增产。于是他访问了各民族的社员。有的说是地太烂，最好丢荒了另开田；有的说是人懒，只要多犁耙几道，多上点肥料，就不信改造不过来。封正德觉得仅是多犁还不够，但他相信只要坚持深入群众，不怕想不出个办法来。一天，他在当会计的侄儿家里谈起改造陷坑的事，会计的母亲说：“我们门前山冲里的那一块田往日也有陷坑，一年只收几葫芦谷子；有一年，我倒了好些马粪进去，陷坑没有了，谷子长得很好，一年能收一石几哩！”她又说：“泥土凉，马粪燥，混在一起，谷子就能长得好。”这话使封正德心里一亮，真是踏破铁鞋无觅处，得来全不费工夫。老嫂子说的办法兴许能多收粮食。这时候，县委的一位负责同志到了他队里。封正德向这位同志汇报了这个情况和想法。县委负责同志告诉他不仅要倾听群众意见，还要加以分析。改良土壤的事要和农业技术部门研究，经过试验，逐步推广。这位负责同志派了个农技站的干部来和封正德研究。这位技术干部把鞋子脱了在田里观察很久以后说：“田里的酸性太大，时时刻刻都在起着强烈的化学变化，这坑就是变化的结果。这几年，田里的酸性在逐年增强，马粪已经不顶事了，最好是撒一些石灰中和一下。”这个意见得到了许多社员的拥护，有些青年人说：“赶快撒，有这种毛病的田都撒。”也有人说：“这石灰的性子要多暴有多暴，虫也闹得死，草也糟得坏，水葱般的秧苗能经得住吗？”他们根本不同意撒石灰。封正德根据县委指示，决定先试验几亩，摸出个门道来再大干。头一年，封正德领着几个共青团员试撒了三亩，有的地方，石灰撒得太集中，后来栽上的秧苗果然烧死了；撒得匀净的田里，温度升高了，陷洞没有了，都增产了粮食。封正德总结了一套经验：石灰的用量要适当，酸性大的田多撒、酸性小的田少撒，而且都要撒得很均匀。今年，全队三十多亩酸性大的田都照这个办法撒了石灰，封正德自己撒的有八亩，全都获得了丰收。现在，粮食已过秤入仓，平均亩产八百多斤，比去年增产一倍多，封正德撒的八亩平均亩产一千一百三十斤。这些田共增产了一万多斤粮食。
    以前，哈尼人种田都是稀秧稀植，八寸宽一丛秧，一亩田只栽万把丛。封正德根据土质的情况建议稍微再栽密一点。有些社员不同意，多数社员都不知道密植究竟好不好。封正德想起县委书记常说的一句话：少数民族农民和汉族农民一样，只有见到了事实以后才会相信的，我们当干部的要起带头作用。封正德决定先搞个试验，就和主张稀植的人开展对手赛。在一片七亩大的田里，由主张稀植的人照老规矩种一半；另一半由封正德领着几个共青团员栽，平均每亩栽二万五千丛。这两份田的施肥、薅草等措施都一样，起初都青悠悠的惹人爱，但是谷子打包以后情况就不同了，封正德种的田得了稻热病，谷浆灌得很慢，谷壳也有变黑的了。一个社员说：这一定是栽得太密了。这时候有个老人告诉封正德用当地到处都有的柏枝树叶和乌旧树叶捶烂泡水喷洒。他和共青团员们一连喷洒了三次树叶水。谷壳发黑的现象被抑止了，浆水也浆得很正常。结果，封正德的田平均亩产一千零三十斤；另一半田平均每亩只收七百多斤（都是双季稻）。从此，合理密植就在队里推开了。今年平均每亩密植二万五千丛左右，对粮食增产起了不小作用。
    封正德当队长的这三年中，下菜园生产队的生产面貌有了很大变化，改革了不少阻碍生产发展的陋习，养成了许多好的习惯。以前，哈尼人种庄稼不施肥，现在不仅用绿肥，还用人畜肥。所以粮食年年增产，1958年增产了五成，去年增产两成多，今年又比去年增产了将近两成。
