Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, December 11th. According to the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency, the Central Committee and the Central Auditing Commission of the Bulgarian Communist Party held a plenary session on the 10th. The plenary session heard a report by Zhivkov, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, on the work of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of All Countries held in Moscow, and adopted a corresponding resolution.

The resolution stated that the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party expressed complete satisfaction with the work of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of All Countries and the results achieved at the meeting. The resolution stated that the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of All Countries was an event of historical significance for the further development of the international communist movement and for the fate of the world. The atmosphere of fraternal friendship that permeated the meeting and the unanimous adoption of the Declaration and the Appeal to the Peoples of the World marked a new great victory for Marxism-Leninism and a new victory for the international communist movement in its struggle for peace, democracy, national independence, and socialism.

The meeting armed the fraternal Marxist-Leninist parties and all fighters for peace, democracy, national liberation, and social progress with a new, comprehensively reasoned program, which was formulated on the basis of the only scientific and thorough revolutionary theory of Marxism-Leninism and on the basis of proletarian internationalism.

The resolution pointed out that the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party expressed its unconditional support for all the arguments in the Declaration and the Appeal to the Peoples of the World of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of All Countries. The Declaration is a new example of the creative development of Marxist-Leninist thought and embodies the collective wisdom and experience of the world communist and workers' movement. It opens up brilliant prospects for the struggle for peace and the victory of the communist cause before the communist parties of all countries, the working class, and the working masses of the whole world.

In view of the great significance of the Moscow meeting and the Declaration and the Appeal to the Peoples of the World unanimously adopted at the meeting, the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party believes that these two documents must become the fighting program and guide to action for the entire work of the Party, the government, state and social organs and organizations in building a socialist society in the People's Republic of Bulgaria and striving for the victory of the cause of world peace, democracy, and socialism.

The resolution went on to say that at the current decisive stage in our common struggle against the forces of imperialism and war and in striving for new victories for the cause of the working class, it is of great significance to educate Party members and the working people in this spirit in the future, that is, loyalty to the cause of peace and communism, loyalty to the principles of proletarian internationalism, to the principles of unbreakable fraternal friendship and unity with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, to the principles of friendship and cooperation with the fraternal people of China and other socialist countries, and a high degree of vigilance and irreconcilable spirit towards the enemies of peace, democracy, national independence, and socialism.

The resolution pointed out that it is necessary to disseminate the invincible Marxist-Leninist ideology more widely among Party members and the working people, to deeply understand the Marxist-Leninist analysis and conclusions made in the Declaration on the current fundamental issues and on our strategy and tactics in the class struggle, and to study and creatively apply the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union more diligently—this experience is of fundamental significance for all Marxist-Leninist parties.

The Central Committee believes that it is a very important task to launch the most extensive political work among Party members and the working people of our country to explain the basic arguments of the Declaration and the Appeal to the Peoples of the World. The resolution stated that the Party's ideological and political activities should be more militant, and should more effectively and aggressively oppose bourgeois ideology and revisionist and dogmatic-sectarian tendencies that deviate from Marxism-Leninism.

    保共中央举行全体会议
    通过决议支持各国共产党和工人党代表会议文件
    新华社索非亚11日电　据保加利亚通讯社报道：保加利亚共产党中央委员会和中央检查委员会10日举行了全体会议。全会听取了保共中央第一书记日夫科夫关于在莫斯科举行的各国共产党和工人党代表会议的工作的报告，并通过了相应的决议。
    决议说：保共中央全会对于各国共产党和工人党代表会议的工作和会议所取得的结果表示完全满意。决议说，各国共产党和工人党代表会议是对进一步发展国际共产主义运动、对世界的命运具有历史意义的事件。在会议上洋溢的兄弟友好的气氛和一致通过声明和告世界人民书的情况，标志着马克思列宁主义的新的伟大胜利，标志着国际共产主义运动为争取和平、民主、民族独立和社会主义而斗争的新的胜利。
    会议用新的全面论证的纲领武装了兄弟的马克思列宁主义政党和一切为和平、民主、民族解放和社会进步而斗争的战士，这个纲领是在唯一科学的和彻底的革命理论马克思列宁主义原则的基础上、在无产阶级国际主义的基础上制定的。
    决议指出，保加利亚共产党中央委员会表示无条件支持各国共产党和工人党代表会议声明和告世界人民书的全部论点。声明是创造性地发展马克思列宁主义思想的新范例，是世界共产主义和工人运动的集体智慧和经验的体现。它在各国共产党、全世界工人阶级和劳动群众面前打开了为争取和平和共产主义事业的胜利而斗争的光辉前景。
    鉴于莫斯科会议和会议一致通过的声明和告世界人民书的巨大意义，保共中央全体会议认为，这两个文件必须成为全党、政府、国家和社会机关与团体在保加利亚人民共和国建设社会主义社会和争取世界和平、民主和社会主义事业的胜利的全部工作的战斗纲领和行动指南。
    决议接着说，在我们反对帝国主义与战争势力的共同斗争以及争取工人阶级事业取得新胜利的现在的决定性阶段，今后用这种精神教育党员和劳动人民有着巨大意义，即忠于和平和共产主义事业，忠于无产阶级国际主义原则，同苏联共产党和苏联人民不可动摇的兄弟友谊和团结的原则同中国和其他社会主义国家兄弟人民的友谊和合作的原则，以及对和平、民主、民族独立与社会主义的敌人高度警惕和不可调和的精神。
    决议指出，必须在党员和劳动人民中间更广泛地传播不可战胜的马克思列宁主义思想，深刻理解声明对当前那些根本问题以及我们在阶级斗争中的战略和策略所作的马克思列宁主义的分析和结论，更努力地学习和创造性地运用苏联共产党的经验——这个经验对于所有马克思列宁主义政党都有原则意义。
    中央委员会认为，最近在党内和我国劳动人民中间最广泛地展开政治工作，解释声明和告世界人民书的基本论点，是一项非常重要的任务。决议说，党的思想和政治活动应该更具有战斗性，应当更有效地更具进攻性地反对资产阶级思想，反对背离马克思列宁主义的修正主义和教条—宗派主义的倾向。
