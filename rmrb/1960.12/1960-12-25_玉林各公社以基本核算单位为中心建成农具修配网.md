    Yulin's Communes Establish Farm Implement Repair and Assembly Networks Centered on Basic Accounting Units

    (Xinhua News Agency News) Yulin County, Guangxi, People's Communes are vigorously assisting production brigades (basic accounting units) and production teams to establish farm implement repair and assembly stations and groups. A farm implement repair and assembly network centered on production brigades has been formed throughout the county. It has already manufactured more than 195,800 various farm implements and repaired and assembled more than 279,800 various farm implements for this year's autumn harvest, winter planting, and next year's spring plowing.

    Yulin County's winter planting and next year's spring plowing area will be expanded compared to previous years, and the degree of intensive cultivation is also continuously improving. In addition, since autumn, all walks of life have saved a large number of laborers and returned to the front line of agricultural production. Therefore, the task of manufacturing and repairing farm implements this winter and next spring is very heavy. In order to adapt to the new situation in agricultural production and achieve "tools are fully prepared before the farming season arrives," the Yulin County Party Committee, based on the "three-level ownership, with the team as the foundation" system, established a farm implement repair and assembly network centered on production brigades throughout the county to better meet the needs of agricultural production.

    In the process of establishing the farm implement repair and assembly network, the People's Communes have transferred a group of iron, wood, and bamboo workers to the farm implement repair and assembly stations of the production brigades. At the same time, the commune's farm implement, woodworking, and bamboo ware factories have also trained a large number of technical personnel for the brigade repair and assembly stations. Now, in all twenty communes in the county, each commune has a relatively capable farm implement factory, responsible for manufacturing and repairing large and medium-sized farm implements, improving farm implements, and summarizing and guiding the work of the production team's farm implement repair and assembly stations (groups); all two hundred and seventy-three production brigades have one or two farm implement repair and assembly stations, responsible for the manufacturing and repair of small iron, wood, bamboo and other farm implements; every one or two of the county's three thousand production teams has a farm implement repair and assembly group, mainly repairing small bamboo and wood farm implements. The county has basically achieved that minor repairs of general farm implements do not leave the door, medium repairs do not leave the brigade, and major repairs do not leave the commune.

    Establishing a farm implement repair and assembly network centered on the brigade, because the farm implement repair and assembly station is owned by the brigade and is uniformly planned and arranged by the brigade, makes the brigade's farm implement repair and assembly and manufacturing work closely integrated with the brigade's production plan, business management, and economic accounting, showing many advantages in promoting agricultural production.

    玉林各公社以基本核算单位为中心建成农具修配网
    据新华社讯　广西玉林县各人民公社大力帮助生产大队（基本核算单位）和生产小队建立农具修配站、组。在全县形成了一个以生产大队为中心的农具修配网。已为今年的秋收、冬种和明年春耕生产制造各种农具十九万五千八百多件，修配各种农具二十七万九千八百多件。
    玉林县今年冬种和明年春耕播种的面积比往年扩大，精耕细作的程度也不断提高，加上秋季以来各行各业节约出大批劳动力返回农业生产第一线，因此，今冬明春农具的制造和修配任务十分繁重。为了适应农业生产的新形势，作到“农时未到，工具齐备”，中共玉林县委根据“三级所有，队为基础”的制度，在全县建起了以生产大队为中心的农具修配网，更好地满足农业生产的需要。
    在建立农具修配网的过程中，各人民公社都为生产大队农具修配站调剂了一批铁、木、竹工人。同时，各公社的农具、木器、竹器等厂还为大队修配站培养了大批技术力量。现在，全县二十个公社，每一个公社都有一个比较精干的农具厂，担负制造和修配大中型农具、改良农具、总结指导生产队农具修配站（组）的工作；二百七十三个生产大队都有一个或两个农具修配站，负责小型铁、木、竹等农具的制造和修配工作；全县三千多个生产小队每一个或两个有一个以修配竹、木小件农具为主的农具修配组。全县基本上做到了一般农具小修不出门、中修不出大队、大修不出社。
    以大队为中心建立农具修配网，由于农具修配站归大队所有，由大队统一计划安排，使大队的农具修配、制造工作与大队的生产计划、经营管理、经济核算紧密结合起来，在促进农业生产上显示出了很多优越性。
