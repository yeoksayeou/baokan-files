    Further Develop the Great Undertaking of Mountain Area Construction
    Shao Shiping, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
    For three years, cadres in Jiangxi Province have been going up to the mountains and down to the countryside to develop and construct mountain areas.
    In the winter of 1957, more than 50,000 cadres throughout the province enthusiastically responded to the Party's call and formed a powerful labor force to go up to the mountains and down to the countryside to vigorously develop agricultural, forestry, and land reclamation undertakings. In just three years, the cadres who went up to the mountains and down to the countryside, together with the broad masses of people in the mountain areas, worked together with one heart and one mind, striving to be strong, working hard, overcoming difficulties, and establishing more than 300 state-owned comprehensive reclamation farms on the vast red soil wilderness and in the remote mountains and dense forests. Each reclamation farm actively developed various production undertakings in accordance with the principle of taking grain as the key link, and comprehensively managing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fisheries, and industry. This year, the total industrial and agricultural output value of state-owned reclamation farms throughout the province is expected to reach 580 million yuan (including the collectively owned parts under the leadership of the reclamation farms, the same below), an increase of 13% over last year. The total grain output reached more than 1.2 billion jin, an increase of about 10% over last year. Reclamation farms have established more than 2,000 large and small factories, and built 105 new hydroelectric and thermal power stations. The task of timber and bamboo cutting undertaken by the reclamation farms accounts for more than 60% of the province's timber and bamboo cutting task. The task of transferring live pigs and poultry completed by the reclamation farms accounts for a considerable proportion of the total number of live pigs and poultry transferred in the province. With the development of industrial and agricultural production, the transportation, cultural, educational, and health undertakings in the mountain areas have also been greatly developed. All of these indicate that tens of thousands of cadres going up to the mountains and down to the countryside have opened up a new situation of vigorous development for the socialist construction of the mountain areas throughout the province, and have brought about and are bringing about tremendous changes in the appearance of the mountain areas. The mountain areas, which have always been considered poor and backward, are now displaying a brand-new spirit of prosperity in front of the people.
    The cadres who went up to the mountains and down to the countryside closely combined the grand ambition of developing and building new socialist mountain areas with strengthening their own training and transformation. The vast majority of them, in the boiling socialist construction of the mountain areas, ate, lived, worked, and consulted with the broad masses of working people. They have learned many production technologies and scientific knowledge, enhanced their labor viewpoint, mass viewpoint, and production viewpoint, and further established the proletarian world outlook, and are gradually training themselves into revolutionary cadres who combine mental and physical labor, who are both red and expert. The heroic deeds of tens of thousands of cadres fighting in the mountain areas have set a good example for cadres and people throughout Jiangxi Province to vigorously develop agriculture, vigorously develop grain, build new socialist mountain areas and new rural areas.
    Through the hard work of all the cadres who went up to the mountains and down to the countryside and the people in the mountain areas, the state-owned comprehensive reclamation farms throughout the province have been gradually consolidated. The undertaking of developing and building mountain areas has achieved great success and accumulated rich experience. We should seriously sum up experience on the basis of the achievements already made, and further rectify, consolidate, and improve the state-owned reclamation farms, so that this kind of state-owned agricultural enterprise can play a greater role in the mass movement of vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain.
    In order to further rectify, consolidate, and improve state-owned reclamation farms, and accelerate the development and construction of mountain areas, it is necessary to implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, grain as the key link, and comprehensively developing production. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and grain is the foundation of the foundation. Only when agriculture develops can other undertakings in the mountain areas develop faster. Therefore, no matter what kind of reclamation farm it is, it must put the development of agricultural production, especially the development of grain production, in the first place. All manpower, material resources, and financial resources must be subject to the needs of agricultural production. This is a long-term and fundamental task for each reclamation farm, and it is also the key to further consolidating and improving the reclamation farm and comprehensively developing the mountain economy. Jiangxi Province's mountain areas are rich in resources and have many production avenues, but whether the mountain economy can be fully developed ultimately depends on the development of agriculture, especially the development of grain production. Only when agriculture continues to leap forward and grain production continues to increase can we ensure that the living standards of the people in the mountain areas continue to improve, and can also ensure the comprehensive development of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fisheries, and industrial production in the mountain areas. Therefore, emphasizing the vigorous development of agriculture and the vigorous development of grain does not mean weakening the development of various economies such as forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fisheries, and industry in the mountain areas. On the contrary, this is precisely to more effectively realize the comprehensive leap forward of the mountain economy. In the past three years, most of the reclamation farms in Jiangxi Province have firmly grasped the main key of grain production in production and construction, and comprehensively and reasonably arranged the production of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fisheries, and industry. Grain has achieved self-sufficiency, and the production and construction of various aspects have also achieved rapid development, which is a good proof. However, some reclamation farms do not have a clear understanding of the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation. In actual work, they have not well implemented the policy of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively leaping forward. They have opposed the vigorous development of agriculture and the vigorous development of grain to the development of diversified operations, resulting in the failure of grain production and the failure of other production in the mountain areas. This is a lesson. In the past, we said, "Rely on the mountains to eat the mountains, and rely on the water to eat the water." Generally speaking, this is correct. However, the role of "mountains" and "water" can only be more effectively played under the premise of taking grain as the key link. Of course, the general guiding ideology should be taking grain as the key link, but in actual work, it is also necessary to distinguish specific situations. For example, in some areas with very little land and heavy timber and bamboo production tasks, the grain production task should be appropriately reduced.
    Ensuring that the agricultural production frontline has sufficient labor is the key to ensuring grain production, and it is also a major measure to conscientiously implement the Party's fundamental policy of taking agriculture as the foundation. Reclamation farms in Jiangxi Province must resolutely correct the phenomenon of decentralized waste of labor. Squeeze out all possible labor from all aspects, and strengthen the agricultural front, especially the grain production front. The industries run by the reclamation farms that directly serve mountain construction and agricultural production should be enriched and strengthened; industries that use wild plants as raw materials on the spot should continue to be run; industries that do not directly serve agricultural production and compete with large industries for raw materials should be run less or not at all. Other various diversified management undertakings should be rationally arranged according to the agricultural season, according to the principle of "doing more in slack farming seasons, doing less in busy farming seasons, and not doing anything in very busy farming seasons," which not only avoids the phenomenon of competing with agricultural production for labor, but also does not allow seasonal diversified management to miss the opportunity.
    To ensure the rapid development of various undertakings in developing and building mountain areas, it is necessary to solve the difficulty of insufficient labor in mountain areas. To solve the difficulty of insufficient labor in mountain areas, in addition to continuing to improve the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of people in mountain areas, rationally using labor, improving labor organization, and striving to tap labor potential, the fundamental way out is to accelerate the promotion of agricultural mechanization in mountain areas. In the past few years, remarkable results have been achieved in promoting agricultural mechanization in mountain areas. Reclamation farms in Jiangxi have more than 400 standard tractors and many agricultural machines, and in the movement of technological innovation and technological revolution, they have improved, manufactured, and promoted a large number of new agricultural tools and improved tools, which have played a great role in improving work efficiency, saving labor, and promoting production. However, the degree of agricultural mechanization in mountain areas is still very low, and many productions are still manual operations. In order to rapidly change this situation, all state-owned reclamation farms in the province should fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, adhere to the principle of self-reliance, combine with the specific conditions of various places, and formulate practical and feasible plans for realizing mechanization in mountain areas, and strive to realize mechanization in mountain areas as soon as possible, so that production in mountain areas can be transferred from manual operations to the foundation of modern technical production as soon as possible.
    In order to further rectify, consolidate, and improve the state-owned comprehensive reclamation farms, it is necessary to correctly handle the relationship between state ownership and collective ownership in accordance with the Party's policy. Since the cadres went up to the mountains and established state-owned reclamation farms, it has generated strong attraction and profound impact among the broad masses of people in the mountain areas. Therefore, in the people's commune movement in the winter of 1958, according to the needs of production and the requirements of the masses, more than 1,800 advanced agricultural production cooperatives and more than 900,000 farmers voluntarily applied to join various state-owned reclamation farms. After these agricultural cooperatives joined the reclamation farms, they were changed to a production brigade under the leadership of the reclamation farms. Most of them maintained the form of separate management, independent accounting, and self-responsibility for profits and losses, with two ownership systems coexisting under the unified leadership of the state-owned reclamation farms. However, some individual reclamation farms were eager to transition the collective ownership of the entrants to state ownership.
    It must be recognized that the transition from collective ownership to state ownership, and from socialism to communism, is a long-term development direction. We should affirm this direction. However, at the present stage, the reclamation farms should mainly help the production brigades in the field that adopt unified leadership, hierarchical management, separate accounting, and self-responsibility for profits and losses to develop production, increase income, and continue to maintain the form of two ownership systems coexisting for a considerable period of time, and should not rush to transition them to state ownership. After long-term efforts, the productive forces have been greatly improved, production has been greatly developed, and the broad masses of people urgently require the transition, then these production brigades can be transferred from collective ownership to state ownership in batches. For the past few production brigades that have been transferred to state ownership, those that have been transferred well and supported by the masses can be kept unchanged and run resolutely well; if some are indeed not well-conditioned and reluctantly transferred to state ownership, and now production is not doing well and the masses require change, it should also be allowed to restore the form of unified leadership, hierarchical management, separate accounting, and self-responsibility for profits and losses by the field, vigorously develop production, improve production level, and transfer again when conditions are met. At the same time, the reclamation farms should all adhere to the implementation of the Party's policy and properly handle the economic relations between state ownership and collective ownership. Only by conscientiously and seriously checking policies and implementing policies can we more effectively mobilize the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of people and more closely integrate the relationship between state ownership and collective ownership, so as to ensure that the cause of developing and building mountain areas develops faster.
    The situation in Jiangxi Province is very good at present. The mass movement of vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain has formed a new upsurge, and the winter production movement is flourishing. All state-owned reclamation farms throughout the province should be mobilized to raise even higher the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, muster greater revolutionary energy, vigorously grasp winter production, and strive for a bumper harvest next year, and strive for the great cause of developing and building mountain areas to achieve sustained leap forward.

    进一步发展建设山区的伟大事业
    中共江西省委书记　邵式平
    江西省干部上山下乡开发和建设山区已经三年了。
    1957年的冬季，全省有五万多名干部，热烈响应党的号召，组成一支强大的劳动大军，上山下乡，大办农林垦殖事业。在短短的三年中，上山下乡干部和山区的广大人民一起，齐心协力，发愤图强，艰苦奋斗，战胜困难，在辽阔的红土荒原上和荒无人烟的深山密林中，建立起了三百多个国营综合垦殖场。各个垦殖场都根据以粮为纲，农林牧副渔业和工业综合经营的方针，积极发展了各项生产事业。今年，全省国营垦殖场的工农业总产值预计可达五亿八千万元（包括划归垦殖场领导的集体所有制部分，下同），比去年增长了13％。粮食的总产量达到十二亿多斤，比去年增长10％左右。垦殖场兴办的大小工厂有二千多个，新建的水、火力发电站有一百零五座。垦殖场担负的木竹采伐任务占到全省木竹采伐任务的60％以上。垦殖场完成的生猪、家禽的上调任务在全省生猪、家禽上调任务总数中占了相当大的比重。随着工农业生产的发展，山区的交通运输、文教卫生事业也都有了很大的发展。所有这些都表明，几万干部上山下乡，为全省山区的社会主义建设开辟了一个蓬勃发展的新局面，使山区的面貌发生了和正在发生着巨大的变化。一向被人认为贫困落后的山区，正以欣欣向荣的崭新气概展示在人们的面前。
    上山下乡干部把开发、建设社会主义新山区的宏大抱负同加强自己的锻炼和改造紧密结合起来。他们中间的绝大多数人，在山区沸腾的社会主义建设的大熔炉中，和广大劳动人民同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。他们学会了许多生产技术和科学知识，增强了劳动观点、群众观点和生产观点，进一步树立了无产阶级的世界观，正在逐步把自己锻炼成为脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的又红又专的革命干部。几万干部奋战山区的英雄事迹，为江西全省干部和全省人民树立了大办农业、大办粮食、建设社会主义新山区和新农村的良好榜样。
    经过全体上山下乡干部和山区人民的辛勤劳动，全省的国营综合垦殖场已经逐步地巩固起来了。开发和建设山区的事业取得了很大的成绩，积累了丰富的经验。我们应当在已有成绩的基础上，认真总结经验，进一步整顿、巩固和提高国营垦殖场，使这种全民所有制农业企业在大办农业、大办粮食的全民运动中发挥更大的作用。
    为了进一步整顿、巩固和提高国营垦殖场，加速山区的开发和建设，必须贯彻执行农业为基础，以粮为纲，全面发展生产的方针。农业是国民经济的基础，粮食是基础的基础。只有农业发展了，山区的其他各项事业才能更快的发展。因此，不论哪种地区的垦殖场，都必须把发展农业生产，首先是发展粮食生产放在首要地位。一切人力、物力和财力的使用都必须服从农业生产的需要。这是各个垦殖场一个长期的根本性的任务，也是关系着进一步巩固、提高垦殖场，全面发展山区经济的关键。江西省山区的资源丰富，生产门路很多，但是山区的经济能否全面发展，归根结底取决于农业的发展，特别是粮食生产的发展。只有农业不断跃进，粮食不断增产，才能保证山区人民的生活水平不断改善，也才能保证山区的林、牧、副、渔业和工业生产的全面发展。因此，强调大办农业，大办粮食，丝毫也不是意味着削弱山区的林、牧、副、渔和工业等多种经济的发展，恰恰相反，这正是为了更有效的实现山区经济的全面跃进。过去三年，江西省绝大部分垦殖场在生产建设中，正是由于紧紧抓住了粮食生产这个主要关键，全面地、合理地安排农林牧副渔和工业各方面的生产，粮食做到了自给，各方面的生产建设也得到了飞跃的发展，这就是很好的证明。但是，也有一些垦殖场对于以农业为基础的思想认识不够明确，在实际工作中，还没有很好地贯彻执行以粮为纲，全面跃进的方针。他们把大办农业、大办粮食和发展多种经营彼此对立起来，结果粮食生产上不去，山区其他各项生产也上不去，这是个教训。过去我们讲“靠山吃山，靠水吃水”。一般说来这是对的。但是，必须在以粮为纲的前提下，才能更有效的发挥“山”和“水”的作用。当然，总的指导思想应当是以粮为纲，但在实际工作中，还要区别具体情况。比如在一些土地很少而木竹生产任务很重的地区，粮食生产任务就应该适当的减少一些。
    保证农业生产第一线有足够的劳动力，是保证粮食生产的关键，也是认真贯彻执行党的以农业为基础这一根本方针的重大措施。江西省各垦殖场必须坚决纠正劳力使用上的分散浪费现象。从各方面挤出一切可能挤出的劳动力，加强农业战线、首先是粮食生产战线。垦殖场所办的工业，凡是直接为山区建设和农业生产服务的应当予以充实和加强；凡是就地取材利用野生植物作为原料的工业，应当继续办下去；凡是不是直接为农业生产服务，又与大工业争原料的工业，应该少办或不办。其他各种多种经营事业，都应根据农时季节，按照“农闲多办，农忙少办，大忙不办”的原则进行合理安排，既要避免与农业生产争劳动力的现象，又不要使季节性的多种经营错过时机。
    要保证开发和建设山区的各项事业的迅速发展，必须解决山区劳动力不足的困难。要解决山区劳动力不足的困难，当前除了继续提高广大山区人民的劳动积极性，合理使用劳动力，改善劳动组织，努力挖掘劳动潜力之外，根本出路是在加速推行山区的农业机械化。过去几年来，在山区推行农业机械化方面已经取得了显著的成效。江西各垦殖场已拥有四百多标准台的拖拉机和许多农业机器，并且在技术革新和技术革命运动中，改良、制造和推广了大批的新式农具和改良工具，这对提高工效，节省劳力，促进生产都起了很大的作用。但是，目前山区农业机械化的程度还很低，许多生产仍是手工操作，为了迅速改变这种情况，全省各国营垦殖场都应该把群众的积极性充分调动起来，本着自立更生的原则，结合各地具体情况，作出切实可行的实现山区机械化的规划，力争早日在山区实现机械化，使山区的生产能够尽快地从手工操作转向现代技术生产的基础上来。
    为了进一步整顿、巩固和提高国营综合垦殖场，必须按照党的政策，正确处理全民所有制和集体所有制的关系。从干部上山，建立国营垦殖场以来，它在山区广大人民中间产生了强烈的吸引力和深刻的影响，因此，在1958年冬季的人民公社化运动中，根据生产的需要和群众的要求，当时有一千八百多个高级农业生产合作社和九十多万农民自动申请加入了各个国营垦殖场。这些农业社加入垦殖场以后，改为垦殖场领导下的一个生产大队，其中绝大部分是在国营垦殖场的统一领导下，保持单独经营、自负盈亏两种所有制同时并存的形式。但是，也有个别垦殖场有急于把入场的集体所有制过渡到全民所有制的情绪。
    必须认识，由集体所有制过渡到全民所有制，由社会主义过渡到共产主义，这是长远的发展方向。我们应当肯定这个方向。但是，在现阶段，各垦殖场对于场内采取统一领导、分级管理、单独核算、自负盈亏的集体所有制的生产大队，在今后相当长的时间内，主要应从各方面去帮助它们发展生产，增加收入，继续保持两种所有制同时并存的形式，不要急于把它们过渡为全民所有制。经过长时期的努力，生产力大大提高了，生产极大的发展了，广大群众迫切要求过渡的时候，才能够将这些生产大队分期分批的由集体所有制转为全民所有制。对于过去少数已经转为全民所有制的生产大队，转得好的，群众拥护的，可以不予变动，并且把它坚决办好；如果有的确因条件不够，勉强转为全民所有制，现在生产搞得不好，群众要求改变的，也应允许恢复由场统一领导、分级管理、单独核算、自负盈亏的形式，大力发展生产，提高生产水平，到条件具备时再转。同时，各垦殖场都应当坚持贯彻党的政策，妥善处理全民所有制和集体所有制之间的经济关系。只有认真地、严肃地检查政策、贯彻政策，才能更有效地调动广大群众的生产积极性，更加密切全民所有制和集体所有制的关系，以保证开发和建设山区的事业更快地向前发展。
    目前江西省的形势很好。大办农业、大办粮食的群众运动已经形成了新的高潮，冬季生产运动正蓬勃开展起来。全省各国营垦殖场都应当动员起来，更高地举起总路线、大跃进和人民公社的三面红旗，鼓足更大的革命干劲，大抓冬季生产，力争明年大丰收，力争开发和建设山区的伟大事业实现持续的跃进。
