Movement within Stillness
Yang Ling

In nature and in society, all things are in constant motion, constant change, and constant development. "In the general sense, motion is the mode of existence of matter, its inherent attribute; it embraces all changes and processes occurring in the universe, from simple change of position to thinking." (Engels, *Dialectics of Nature*, p. 46) The old is always in constant decline, and the new is always in constant growth. No matter what, even the shortest moment, in the universe will not be absolutely still. This is a fundamental view of dialectical materialism. Anyone who forgets or deviates from this point of view will not have any revolutionary spirit and will be left behind by the torrent of the times, which never stops moving forward for even a second.

Dialectical materialism believes that all things are in constant motion, development, and change, while not denying the state of relative stillness and relative equilibrium of things. In the eyes of metaphysicians, this is a mutually exclusive proposition. In the eyes of dialectical materialists, motion and stillness are a unity of opposites. Motion is the principal aspect of the contradiction, and stillness is the secondary aspect. Motion is absolute, and stillness is relative. The motion, development, and change we are talking about always refer to the motion, development, and change of things with relative stability. If there is nothing stable or definite in the ever-flowing river of history, if everything is like a "white horse flashing past," so that people can only see a blurred and uncertain flash of white light, then people cannot understand the world, cannot understand the motion, development, and change of things, and cannot even talk about grasping the laws of development of things, and will fall into the mire of agnosticism and nihilism.

We are proponents of the theory of uninterrupted revolution, and at the same time, we are proponents of the theory of stages of revolutionary development. We believe that revolution will never stop, not for a moment, and it is impossible for anyone to want it to stop. We also believe that if the stages of revolutionary development are ignored, the theory of uninterrupted revolution will become empty talk. The relative stillness and temporary equilibrium of things play a great role in the development and change of things. Relative stillness, temporary equilibrium, is a state in which new things are gradually growing, accumulating strength, and preparing to break through the old stage of development and enter a new stage of development. "Erecting new stone walls on the western reaches of the Yangtze, high gorges give way to a lake in the flatlands;" this is to put the water of the Yangtze River in a state of relative stillness, but this is precisely to make the river flow more powerfully, to transform water power into powerful electricity, and to open up better routes.

The productive forces are always active and developing forward without stopping; the relations of production must be suited to the nature of the productive forces and the level of development of the productive forces. This is the fundamental law of social development. This law itself contains two aspects, and we must grasp it from both aspects: on the one hand, when the relations of production have lagged behind and are restricting the development of the productive forces, the old relations of production must be changed to liberate the productive forces; on the other hand, when the old relations of production have been changed and new relations of production have been established, the new relations of production must be relatively stabilized to protect and promote the productive forces. Under the conditions of relative stability of the new relations of production, constantly improving the new relations of production has a huge role in the further development of the productive forces. Here it is also clear that development is absolute, and stability is relative; there must be a stage of relative stability in development, and the fundamental purpose of relative stability is further development.

The rural people's communes currently implement the system of three-level ownership, with the production team as the basic unit, and stabilizing this system for a relatively long period is precisely for the fundamental purpose of developing the productive forces. Corresponding to this fundamental system, there are many specific work systems. These systems all embody the dialectical relationship between the theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development, and the dialectical relationship between absolute motion and change and relative stillness and equilibrium. "Three fixings," "four fixings," "quota management," and so on, all have the word "fixing." This word "fixing" reflects the stage of development of things, that is, relative stability. These "fixings" are necessary to make the relations of production adapted to the current stage of development of the productive forces more consolidated and more perfect. The Sunji People's Commune in Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, integrated and improved its original labor management and financial management systems, and formulated and implemented the "three divisions and three fixings" system. As a result, the three-level ownership and production team-based relations of production were further improved, strengthening the foundation of the entire people's commune—the production team, and also strengthening the foundation of the entire national economy—agricultural production. It is precisely under relatively stable conditions that the superstructure has a strong reaction on the base, and the relations of production have a strong reaction on the productive forces. All superstructures always serve their economic base and strive to maintain and consolidate their economic base. The old superstructure always wants to maintain the old economic base, and even after the old economic base has been crushed, it still struggles for a long time, trying to revive the old economic base. The new superstructure must also maintain the new economic base in two aspects: on the one hand, it must resolutely fight against the old superstructure, and on the other hand, it must resolutely fight for the new economic base to be more sound and more perfect. The "three divisions and three fixings" of the Sunji Commune is precisely a good system for maintaining new relations of production to promote the development of productive forces.

The main characteristics of the people's commune are its large organizational scale and wide range of activities. It can plan the production and distribution of the entire commune in a unified way, and can arrange the rural labor, materials, and financial resources more effectively, more fully, and more rationally than agricultural cooperatives, accelerating the development of various production and construction undertakings. The basic content of "three divisions and three fixings" is to take the management area (production team) as the basic unit, and at the beginning of each year, "fix" the production tasks and labor, materials, and financial resources to each production squad and each small unit of labor and spending by battle line, project, and time. The time, unit, task completed, labor used, and money spent are all "fixed." "Three divisions and three fixings" is precisely to better ensure that the superiority of "large in size and collective in nature" is more fully exerted. Here, "division" is a reasonable division of labor under the unified leadership of the commune and production team, which obeys and serves the collective cooperation; "fixing" is to stand firm under the general purpose of accelerating the various production and construction undertakings, obeying and serving the development of production. The process of the "three divisions and three fixings" system in Sunji Commune can illustrate that without appropriate "division," but rather "all industries and trades go into action together, all reaching out for people and money," and without reasonable "fixing," but rather each unit handles affairs, uses labor, and spends money arbitrarily, it would be impossible to use human, material, and financial resources more rationally and effectively, and it would be impossible to talk about giving full play to the superiority of "large in size and collective in nature." After unified and reasonable planning, the annual output, labor input, and money spent by each production squad are "fixed" using the method of contracting output, contracting labor, and contracting costs, and the right to use labor, land, draught animals, and agricultural tools is "fixed" in the production squad using the method of "four fixings." This is precisely to better facilitate the most reasonable and effective use of human and material resources under the unified leadership of the commune and production team, and to raise the productive forces and labor productivity to a higher level more quickly; in this process, the ability of the commune, production team, and production squad to manage the collective economy and the collectivist consciousness of the commune members are also raised to a higher level.

After a major change in the relations of production, there must be a period of relative stability. During this relatively stable period, the productive forces develop smoothly, and the quantitative development will not reach a certain level, which will not cause a new qualitative change in the relations of production. This is an objective law that does not depend on people's subjective wishes. In a relatively stable stage, the unbalanced development of the productive forces will also cause local qualitative changes, and the relations of production must also be adjusted locally accordingly, but the overall relations of production cannot go beyond the nature of this large stage. In a relatively long period, relative stability, "fixing" at which level and within which scope, is unchanged. When the specific conditions of the productive forces change, such as the changes in the land of the production squad caused by the water conservancy projects, the greater improvement in the degree of agricultural mechanization, or the irresistible disasters suffered by some land, the specific implementation of "three contracting," "four fixings," and "three divisions and three fixings" may and should also have corresponding changes. However, this kind of change is a "movement" on the basis of "fixing." This local "movement" is subject to the overall "fixing." From the perspective of the entire course of historical development, the "fixing" of a certain period serves the "movement" of the entire course.

Motion is absolute, and stillness is relative. There is stillness in motion, and there is motion in stillness. "All rest, all equilibrium is only relative, they are only significant with respect to one or another definite form of motion." "The fact that the measure of motion must be its opposite - rest - is a difficulty and a bitter pill for our metaphysicians. ... From the point of view of dialectics, the possibility that motion manifests itself in its opposite, in rest, is absolutely no difficulty. For dialectics, all these oppositions, as we have seen, are only relative; absolute rest, unconditional equilibrium, does not exist. Individual movements tend toward equilibrium, but the overall movement destroys equilibrium. Thus, rest and equilibrium, at the moment of their existence, are only the result of limited movement..." (Engels, *Anti-Dühring*, pp. 60, 63) Relative stillness and constant progress are two aspects of the unity of opposites. When a person walks, he always steps on the ground on the one hand and moves forward on the other, and it is impossible to lift his legs and move forward without touching the ground. "Not stopping is not possible"; each step of "stopping" is precisely for the sake of "moving." "Moving" to a certain destination has another stage of "stopping"; and this "stopping" is the beginning of a new stage of "moving."

It is necessary to look at the development and change of various things with a combined view of the theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development, and to see the relative stillness in the absolute movement, in order to see the foothold for moving forward with big strides, and to move forward step by step in a down-to-earth manner.

    动中有静
    杨岭
    在自然界，在社会上，一切事物都是不断运动、不断变化、不断发展的。“就是一般的意义来说，运动是物质的存在形式、物质的固有属性，它包括宇宙中所发生的一切变化和过程，从简单的位置变动起到思维止。”（恩格斯：《自然辩证法》第46页）旧东西总是在不断地衰亡，新东西总是在不断地生长。宇宙间的任何事物，哪怕是最短的一刹那，也不会绝对地静止下来。这是辩证唯物主义的一个最根本的观点。谁忘记了或者背离了这个观点，他就不会有一点革命精神，他就会被一秒钟也不停止前进的时代的洪流甩在一旁。
    辩证唯物主义认为万事万物都在不断运动、不断发展、不断变化，同时并不否认事物相对静止、相对均衡的状态。在形而上学者看来，这是一种相互排斥的论断。在辩证唯物主义者看来，运动和静止是矛盾的统一。运动是矛盾的主要方面，静止是矛盾的次要方面。运动是绝对的，静止是相对的。我们所说的运动、发展、变化，总是指具有相对稳定性的事物的运动、发展、变化。如果说在永不停息的历史的长河中没有任何稳定的、确定的东西，如果认为一切事物都像“白驹过隙”一样使人们只能看到模糊的、不确定的一道白光，那末，人们就不可能认识世界，不可能认识事物的运动、发展、变化，也就根本谈不到掌握事物发展的规律性了，那就会陷入不可知论和虚无主义的泥坑。
    我们是不断革命论者，同时又是革命发展阶段论者。我们认为：革命永远不会停止，每时每刻都不会停止，任何人想要它停止都是不可能的。我们又认为：如果忽视了革命发展的阶段性，不断革命就会成为空谈。事物的相对的静止状态和暂时的均衡状态，对于事物的发展、变化有很大的作用。相对的静止，暂时的均衡，就是这样一种状态：新事物在逐渐成长，积蓄力量，为突破旧的发展阶段和进入新的发展阶段作准备。在长江上“更立西江石壁，高峡出平湖”；这是使长江的水处于相对静止的状态，而这正是为了使江水更有力地奔流，为了使水力转化为强大的电力，为了开辟更好的航路。
    生产力永远活跃而不停地向前发展；生产关系一定要适合生产力的性质，适合生产力发展的水平。这是社会发展的根本规律。这个规律本身包含着两个方面，我们也必须从两个方面去掌握它：一方面，当生产关系已经落后于并且束缚着生产力的发展的时候，就必须变革旧的生产关系以解放生产力；另方面，当旧的生产关系已经变革、新的生产关系已经建立起来的时候，就必须相对地稳定新的生产关系以保护和促进生产力。在新的生产关系相对稳定的条件下，使新的生产关系不断完善起来，对于生产力的进一步发展有巨大的作用。这里也很清楚：发展是绝对的，稳定是相对的；在发展中必然要有相对稳定的阶段，而相对稳定的根本目的是进一步发展。
    农村人民公社在现阶段实行三级所有、队为基础的制度，在相当长的时期内稳定这个制度，根本目的正是为了发展生产力。同这个根本制度相适应的，还有许多具体工作的制度。这些制度，都体现出了不断革命论和革命发展阶段论的辩证关系，绝对的运动、变化和相对的静止、均衡的辩证关系。“三定”，“四固定”，“定额管理”，等等，都有一个“定”字。这个“定”字反映了事物发展的阶段性，也就是相对稳定性。这些“定”，是使同现阶段生产力发展状况相适应的生产关系更加巩固、更加完善所必需的。山西万荣县孙吉公社把原有的劳动管理和财务管理的制度配套成龙、综合提高，制定和推行了“三分三定”的制度，其结果，使三级所有、队为基础的生产关系更加健全，加强了整个人民公社的基础——生产队，同时也加强了整个国民经济的基础——农业生产。正是在相对稳定的条件下，上层建筑对基础、生产关系对生产力起了强有力的反作用。一切上层建筑，总是为自己的经济基础服务，并力求维护和巩固自己的经济基础的。旧的上层建筑总是要维护旧的经济基础，甚至在旧的经济基础已经被粉碎之后还要长时期地挣扎，企图复活旧的经济基础。新的上层建筑也必须从两方面维护新的经济基础：一方面坚决地同旧的上层建筑作斗争，另方面坚决地为自己的经济基础更加健全、更加完善而斗争。孙吉公社的“三分三定”，正是维护新的生产关系以推进生产力发展的一种好制度。
    人民公社的主要特点是组织规模大、活动范围广，可以统一筹划全社的生产和分配，可以比农业社更有效更充分更合理地安排农村的人力、物力、财力，加快各项生产建设事业的发展。“三分三定”的基本内容是以管理区（生产队）为基本单位，每年年初把生产任务和人力、物力、财力分战线、分项目、分时间“定”到各个生产小队和各个用工、花钱的小单位，哪个时候、哪个单位完成什么样的任务、用多少工、花多少钱，都“定”下来。“三分三定”正是为了更好地保证“一大二公”的优越性更充分地发挥出来。在这里，“分”是在公社和生产队统一领导下的合理分工，服从并服务于集体的合作；“定”是在加速各项生产建设事业的总的目的下站定脚跟，服从并服务于生产的发展。孙吉公社的“三分三定”制度产生的过程就可以说明：如果没有适当的“分”，而是“行行业业齐上马，都伸手要人要钱”，如果没有合理的“定”，而是各单位随意办事、用工、花钱，那就不可能更合理更有效地运用人力、物力、财力，也就说不上发挥“一大二公”的优越性了。经过统一的合理的规划，用包产、包工、包成本的办法把各个生产小队每年的产量、用工数、用钱数“定”下来，用“四固定”的办法把劳力、土地、耕畜、农具的使用权“定”在生产小队，正是为了更便于在公社和生产队统一领导下最合理最有效地运用人力、物力，把生产力和劳动生产率更快地提高到更高的水平；在这过程中，同时又把公社、生产队和生产小队经营管理集体经济的能力和社员群众的集体主义觉悟也提到更高的水平。
    生产关系大变革之后，一定要有一定时期的相对稳定。在这相对稳定的时期里，生产力顺利地发展着，发展的数量达不到一定的程度，就不会引起生产关系的新的质变。这是不依人的主观愿望为转移的客观规律。在相对稳定的一个阶段里，生产力的发展不平衡，也会引起局部的质变，生产关系也要作相应的局部的调整，但是总的生产关系却不可能超出这个大的阶段的性质。在相当长的时期内，相对的稳定，“定”在哪一级、哪个范围内，是不变的。在生产力的具体条件变了的时候，例如兴修的水利工程使生产小队的土地发生了变化，例如农业机械化程度有了较大的提高，例如有的土地受了不可抗拒的灾害等等，“三包”“四固定”“三分三定”的具体执行也可能而且应该有相应的变动。可是，这样的变动是在“定”的基础上的“动”。这个局部的“动”是受制约于整体的“定”的。从历史发展的全程看，一定时期的“定”又是为全程的“动”服务的。
    动是绝对的，静是相对的。动中有静，静中有动。“任何静止，任何平衡只是相对的，它们只对这个或那个特定的运动形式而言，才是有意义的。”“运动的计量物不得不是它的反面——静止，这一事实对我们的形而上学者是一个难题和一种苦药。……从辩证法观点看来，运动表现于其反面、表现于静止的这种可能性绝对不是困难。对辩证法来说，全部这一切对立像我们所见到的，只是相对的；绝对的静止、无条件的平衡是不存在的。个别的运动趋向于平衡，可是总的运动又破坏平衡。这样，静止和平衡在其存在之时只是有限制的运动的结果……”（恩格斯：《反杜林论》第60、63页）相对的静止和不断的前进，是矛盾的统一的两个方面。人在走路的时候，总是一方面脚踏实地，一方面迈步前进，不可能抬起腿来就脚不沾地一直向前。“不止不行”；每一步的“止”正是为了“行”。“行”到一定的目的地又有一个阶段的“止”；而这“止”又是“行”的新阶段的开始。
    要用不断革命论和革命发展阶段论相结合的观点来看各种事物的发展变化，从绝对的动中看到相对的静，才能看清大踏步前进的立脚点，才能脚踏实地步步前进。
