Xinhua News Agency, Kunming Electric Dispatch: The Party Committee of Banqiao People's Commune in Baoshan County, Yunnan Province, through in-depth key investigations and research, has explored a reasonable proportion of year-round labor arrangement based on local conditions. Under the guidance of the ideology of taking agriculture as the foundation and grain as the key link, after overall arrangements, they have taken the initiative in labor use, thus realizing an all-round leap forward with grain as the key link. This year, the commune's measures for increasing production of major spring grain crops were completed on time and with quality, resulting in a bumper grain harvest; pig raising has also developed; sideline income averages more than 50,000 yuan per month, guaranteeing monthly wage payments; and 8,600 mu of tea trees were planted this year, more than the total planted in the past six years.

The Party Committee of Banqiao Commune, from its experience in leading agricultural production over the past few years, has realized that how to arrange and use labor to adapt to the needs of various advanced measures in agricultural production is a major issue. Only by placing the main force on grain production can we ensure that grain production develops forward at the fastest speed. To solve this problem well, at the beginning of this year, the Commune Party Committee focused on going deep into Hanzhuang Management Area, which is representative in terms of cultivated land area, crops, and labor force, and conducted detailed investigation and research work together with cadres and commune members. They first calculated the annual grain production, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, forestry, and other projects, as well as the labor requirements, for the entire management area. From this thorough assessment, they deeply felt that agricultural production is a whole; from spring plowing to autumn harvest, each season and each measure are closely linked. In addition, most of the land is double-cropped, and failure in the previous season will affect the next season. Therefore, the labor arrangement needs to be considered comprehensively. Then, through visits and discussions, many cadres and commune members suggested that it would be best to fix the labor force needed for field management on a regular basis throughout the year, and the remaining labor force should be concentrated or dispersed according to the needs of agricultural production in different seasons. They unanimously believed that the benefits of doing so are: agriculture will have a basic, permanent team responsible for the regular field management work, which will make it easier for commune members to become familiar with the characteristics of the land and the growth patterns of crops, better implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, improve cultivation levels, and also facilitate the establishment of a year-round production responsibility system that integrates planting, management, and harvesting. In response to this request, the Commune Party Committee, together with the cadres and commune members of Hanzhuang Management Area, calculated the proportion of labor fixed in various aspects such as field production throughout the year, as well as how to arrange labor to adapt to the requirements of changes in agricultural seasons, based on the different needs of grain production and other production in each season.

Through such investigation and research, the Commune Party Committee determined, based on the fact that each laborer can manage six to eight mu of farmland on a regular basis, to fix 50% of the labor force in the production team to form a year-round basic team, specifically responsible for completing the team's regular basic farm work; 30% of the labor force will be concentrated or dispersed according to different agricultural seasons. They will mainly serve the needs of grain production, while fully utilizing the gaps in grain production to engage in forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery production; and 20% of the labor force will engage in livestock breeding, welfare services, and management of tea gardens and nurseries. The use of these specialized forces is also flexibly arranged with grain production as the key link. For example, during the busy season of harvesting and planting, the commune members who raise plowing cattle can be invested in plowing fields; sideline occupations, except for necessary transportation, can be suspended; and the firewood cutting labor force can prepare fuel for the canteen in advance when farm work is relatively loose, and then be drawn out to engage in agricultural production during busy seasons, and so on. This ensures that more than 80% of the labor force can be invested in the front line of agricultural production during busy seasons.

After the year-round basic teams are fixed, each production team forms several year-round field management groups. Usually, each group carries out regular work, and during busy times, the production team gives unified command. When the mobile forces are invested in farmland production, they are generally matched on the basis of fixed field management groups, and the organizational leadership remains unchanged. After doing this, the group's responsibilities are clear, and the commune members can understand the characteristics of the land they manage and study crop cultivation techniques, which is conducive to promoting various advanced technical measures and ensuring the implementation of the year-round responsibility system.

This method of arranging and using labor, through exploration, experimentation, and promotion, has played a significant role in developing production. During the tense period of summer harvesting and summer planting this year, the whole commune systematically organized 80% of the labor force to carry out harvesting and planting, so that 73% of the paddy fields were planted ten days earlier than last year despite the threat of severe drought, and the rest were also planted on time; the spring crops were also harvested quickly and well. After the planting of rice seedlings was completed, 17,900 mu of rice seedlings suffered from pests, but because the paddy fields of each production team were managed by basic teams, plus the cooperation of mobile teams to capture the pests, the rice seedlings did not suffer much damage. During the mid-cultivation period, in addition to the year-round basic teams being responsible for management by area, each production team also transferred more than 2,000 mobile laborers to strengthen the mid-cultivation front, ensuring timely weeding and topdressing. At the same time, due to the dedicated and meticulous management of the basic teams, measures such as water withdrawal, sunning the fields, and topdressing were relatively timely. 8,600 mu of third-class seedlings were continuously topdressed three times, promoting the balanced growth of the seedlings. In the autumn harvest and autumn planting, also because of the fixed labor force carrying out field production throughout the year, there is no need to temporarily mobilize labor. Therefore, the autumn planting work gained the initiative from the beginning, truly achieving simultaneous harvesting, collecting and planting. Before the full organization of the autumn harvest, each production team also extracted most of the mobile labor to carry out preparatory work such as repairing warehouses, drying grounds, repairing agricultural tools, and preparing daily necessities during the busy season, so that all 138 production teams in the whole commune built more than two "three-in-one soil" drying grounds, repaired warehouses sufficient to store rations, seeds, and feed, and also prepared sufficient tools for threshing, transportation, plowing, and harrowing. As soon as the busy season arrived, each production team transferred the mobile labor force from sideline production to harvesting and planting.

    摸清农事变化规律　以粮为纲全面安排
    板桥公社常年劳力使用比例合理
    农忙季节80％劳力投入农业生产第一线；粮食丰收，养猪和副业都有发展
    新华社昆明电　云南省保山县板桥人民公社党委深入重点调查研究，根据当地情况摸索出了一个常年劳力安排的合理比例，在以农业为基础、以粮为纲的思想指导下，经过全面安排，在劳力使用上掌握了主动，因而实现了以粮为纲的全面跃进。今年这个公社大春粮食作物的增产措施都按节令按质量完成，粮食获得了丰产丰收；生猪也有了发展；副业收入每月平均有五万多元，保证了按月发工资；今年栽了八千六百亩茶树，比过去六年栽的茶树总和还要多。
    板桥公社党委从几年来领导农业生产的经验当中，认识到安排和使用劳力怎样和农业生产各项先进措施的需要相适应，是一个重大问题，只有把主力放在粮食生产上，才能保证粮食生产以最快的速度向前发展。为了解决好这个问题，公社党委今年初重点深入到耕地面积、农作物和劳力等方面有代表性的汉庄管理区，同干部和社员一起，进行了细致的调查研究工作。他们首先对全管理区全年粮食生产和畜牧、副业、林业等项目和需要劳力的情况加以计算。从摸底排队中，他们深深感到农业生产是一个整体，从春耕到秋收，每个季节、每个措施都紧密相连，加上大多数土地都进行复种，上季搞不好会影响到下季，因此在劳力的安排上需要通盘考虑。接着经过访问和座谈，许多干部和社员都提出，最好把田间管理平时需要的劳力能够常年地固定下来，其余的劳力按不同季节农业生产的需要进行集中或分散活动。他们一致认为这样做的好处是：农业上有了一支常年固定的基本队伍，负责搞好经常性的田间管理工作，便于社员摸熟土地的脾气和作物的生长规律，更好地贯彻农业“八字宪法”，提高耕作水平，也便于建立种、管、收一条龙的常年生产责任制。针对这个要求，公社党委又和汉庄管理区的干部社员一道，根据各个季节粮食生产和其他生产的不同需要，算出了常年固定在田间生产等各方面的劳力所占的比重，以及如何安排劳力以适应农事季节变化的要求。
    经过这样的调查研究，公社党委就根据平时每个劳力可管理六至八亩农田的情况，确定以生产队为单位，固定50％的劳力组成常年基本队伍，专门负责完成全队经常性的基本农活；30％的劳力按不同农事季节进行集中或分散活动，他们以服从粮食生产的需要为主，同时充分利用粮食生产间隙从事林、牧、副、渔等生产；以20％的劳力从事畜牧饲养、生活福利事业、管理茶园苗圃等。这些专业力量的使用，也以粮食生产为纲灵活安排。如收种大忙时，饲养耕牛的社员就可投入犁田；副业除必要的运输以外，其余就可停下来；砍柴劳力在农活较松时事先为食堂备下燃料，农忙时就抽出来搞农业生产，等等。这样，就保证在大忙时能有80％以上的劳力投入农业生产第一线。
    常年基本队伍固定后，各生产队都组成了若干常年的田间管理小组，平时各组进行经常工作，忙时由生产队统一指挥。机动力量投入农田生产时，一般仍以固定的田间管理小组为基础进行搭配，组织领导不变。这样做后，小组责任明确，社员们可以摸着自己所管理的土地的脾气，钻研作物的栽培技术，便于推广各种先进技术措施，保证了常年责任制的贯彻执行。
    这个安排使用劳力的办法，经过边摸索、边试验、边推行，对发展生产起了显著的作用。今年夏收夏种紧张时期，全社有计划地组织了80％的劳力进行收种，使73％的稻田在特大干旱的威胁下，仍然比去年提早十天栽下，其余的也做到按节令栽稻；小春作物也收得快、收得好。栽稻结束后，有一万七千九百亩稻苗发生了虫害，但是由于各生产队的稻田有基本队伍管理，加上机动队伍协力捕捉，使稻苗没有受到多大损失。中耕期间，全社各生产队除了由常年基本队伍分片包干管理外，还分别抽调了两千多个机动劳力，加强中耕战线，保证了适时薅锄追肥。同时由于有基本队伍专责精细管理，撤水、晒田、追肥等措施比较及时，有八千六百亩三类苗连追了三道肥，促进了苗棵的平衡生长。在秋收秋种中，也由于有固定劳力常年进行田间生产，用不着再临时调动劳力，因此秋种工作一开始就争得了主动，真正做到边熟边收边种，全社在全面组织秋收前就收好了零星黄熟的水稻四、五千亩。在大收开始前，各生产队又抽出大部机动劳力搞修仓、晒场、补修农具和准备农忙期间生活必需品等准备工作，使得今年全社一百三十八个生产队都修起了两块以上的“三合土”晒场，修缮了足够存放口粮、籽种、饲料等的仓库，掼盆、运输、犁耙工具也准备得充足。大忙一到，各生产队又把机动劳力从副业生产等方面转移到收种上来。
