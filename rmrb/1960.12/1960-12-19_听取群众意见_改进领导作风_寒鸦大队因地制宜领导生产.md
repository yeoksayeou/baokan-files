Listen to the Opinions of the Masses, Improve Leadership Style
The Hannya Brigade Leads Production According to Local Conditions

(Report from our newspaper) The Hannya Production Brigade of the Cijian People's Commune in Xin'an County, Henan Province, in leading production, has accepted the experience of past management of production teams (i.e., contracted production units, same below), and adopted a leadership method that suits the time and local conditions, resulting in a new situation in production: work plans have become more planned and accurate; the initiative and enthusiasm of the production teams have been brought into play; the commune members are the masters of their own affairs, and their mood is cheerful, and the autumn production has been very good.

The Hannya Brigade is the focus of work of the Xin'an County Party Committee and the Cijian Commune Party Committee. In the past, there were some shortcomings in the leadership of production, both from the commune to the brigade and from the brigade to the production team. This autumn, the brigade Party branch realized that the production teams and commune members had opinions on this leadership method, and then conducted a self-examination of its leadership method. Everyone believed that: in recent years, the cotton field area has been expanded in accordance with local conditions, sloping land has been terraced, soil and water conservation has been carried out, and measures such as rational close planting and improved varieties have been promoted, which has increased yields and increased income; however, there are also many subjective leadership methods. The main ones are: planting plans and major and minor farm work are arranged by the brigade, and the production teams lack flexibility; the characteristics of each production team are not taken into account, and technical measures are generalized, so the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture cannot be better implemented in accordance with local conditions. This hinders the enthusiasm of the production teams. For example, when planting sweet potatoes this spring, the county and commune arranged for 3,000 to 3,500 plants to be planted per mu, and the production teams objected to this regulation, saying: "The slope land is short of water, and planting too densely is not drought-resistant, which affects intertillage and weeding, and insufficient manure cannot increase production; planting 2,000 to 2,500 plants is best." The cadres stationed in the team did not consider the opinions of the production teams. This practice is detrimental to production. The commune and brigade learned a lesson from these facts and realized that if they did not direct production in a realistic way, they could not achieve the goal of increasing production. Therefore, after examination, the leadership method was improved. They implemented "four fixings" for the production teams, clearly stipulating that the production teams have the right to plant according to local conditions, the right to formulate technical measures, and the right to arrange farm work, on the premise of ensuring the completion of the "three guarantees" plan.

After improving the leadership method, in order to further bring into play the role of the commune members as masters of their own affairs, the brigade organized a "old peasant staff" group, and held "old peasant staff" meetings for crop planting and important technical measures. When planting wheat this autumn, the commune originally allocated 1,300 mu of wheat and 258 mu of miscellaneous grains to the Hannya Brigade. The brigade solicited the opinions of the production teams, old peasants, and commune members, who proposed that the area of miscellaneous grains was too large. The reason was: the slope land of Hannya is suitable for planting sweet potatoes, one season of spring sweet potatoes a year, and each mu can harvest 1,000 jin; if miscellaneous grains are planted in summer and black beans are planted again in autumn, the two seasons will only harvest more than 100 jin, the yield is not high, and the farm work is tight. The brigade analyzed the characteristics of the cultivated land in Hannya and believed that the opinions of the masses were correct. As a result, the area of miscellaneous grains was reduced, and land was reserved to appropriately expand the planting of sweet potatoes. Because planting was done according to local conditions and seized the opportunity to plant while the soil was moist, and at the same time, the area of miscellaneous grains was reduced, the labor and animal power released were used to plant wheat. This year, 1,294 mu of the 1,300 mu of wheat were applied with base fertilizer, and more than 50% of the area of miscellaneous grains was also applied with base fertilizer. The amount of fertilizer was sufficient, and the planting was good.

While improving the leadership method, the Hannya Brigade also promptly checked the implementation of the Party's various production policies. Because the leadership style was improved and the policies were implemented, a new atmosphere of unity from top to bottom and concerted efforts to improve production emerged in the Hannya Brigade. At present, all the commune members of the brigade are applying fertilizer on one side and topdressing human and animal manure to the wheat fields on the other side, while preparing to renovate the terraced fields, striving to achieve a greater harvest next summer.

    听取群众意见　改进领导作风
    寒鸦大队因地制宜领导生产
    本报讯　河南新安县磁涧人民公社寒鸦生产大队在领导生产中，接受了过去对生产队（即包产单位，下同）管理的经验，采取了因时制宜、因地制宜的领导方法，生产出现了新局面：工作计划性和准确性加强了；生产队的主动性和积极性发挥出来了；社员当家作主，心情舒畅，秋季各项生产都搞得很好。
    寒鸦大队是中共新安县委和磁涧公社党委的工作重点。过去在领导生产上，公社对大队、大队对生产队都存在着一些缺点。今年秋季，大队党支部觉察到生产队和社员对这种领导方法有意见，随即将自己的领导方法进行了检查。大家认为：近年来，因地制宜地扩大了棉田面积，山坡地整修梯田、搞水土保持，推行了合理密植、优良品种等措施，提高了产量，增加了收入；但是，也有不少主观主义的领导方法。主要是：种植计划、大小农活由大队安排，生产队缺少机动权；不照顾各生产队的特点，技术措施一般化，因此执行农业“八字宪法”不能更好的因地制宜。这样就妨碍生产队的积极性。如今年春季栽种红薯的时候，县和公社布置每亩地栽三千棵到三千五百棵，生产队对这个规定提意见说：“坡地缺水，栽的过密不耐旱，影响中耕除草，粪不足不能增产；栽二千棵到二千五百棵最好。”住队的干部没有考虑生产队的意见。这种作法对生产是不利的。公社和大队从这些事实中吸取了教训，认识到如果不实事求是地指挥生产，就不能达到增产的目的。因此，经过检查，改进了领导方法。他们对生产队实行了“四固定”，明确规定生产队在保证完成“三包”计划的前提下，有权因地种植，有权制定技术措施，有权安排农活。
    改进了领导方法以后，为了进一步发挥社员当家作主的作用，大队组织有老农参谋部，作物种植和重要的技术措施，都召开老农参谋会议。今秋种麦时，公社原分配寒鸦大队种小麦一千三百亩，杂粮二百五十八亩。大队征求了生产队、老农和社员的意见，他们提出：杂粮面积太大。理由是：寒鸦的山坡地适合种红薯，一年种一季春红薯，每亩地可收一千斤；如果夏季种杂粮，秋季再种黑豆，两季也不过收一百多斤，产量不高，农活又紧。大队分析了寒鸦耕地的特点，认为群众的意见正确，结果缩小了杂粮面积，留出地来适当扩大种植红薯。因为做到了因地种植，趁墒抢种，同时减少了杂粮面积，腾出的劳力和畜力用到种小麦上。今年一千三百亩小麦有一千二百九十四亩施了底肥，杂粮面积也有50％以上的施了底肥，施肥量足，种的好。
   在改进领导方法的同时，寒鸦大队还及时检查了党的各项生产政策的执行情况。由于改进了领导作风，贯彻执行了政策，寒鸦大队出现了上下一心，团结一致搞好生产的新气象。目前，全队社员正一面积肥、向麦田追施人粪尿，一面准备整修梯田，争取明年夏季获得更大丰收。
