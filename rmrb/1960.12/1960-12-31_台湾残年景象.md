    Taiwan in its Final Years

    American Troops' "Gluttony Party"
    On December 25th, Taipei newspapers published many reports of Americans and "high-class Chinese" in Taiwan celebrating "Christmas." At the U.S. military's Club 63 on Yuanshan Zhonglie Road in Taipei, at the U.S. military officers' club on Section 3 of Zhongshan North Road, at the U.S. Air Force's 13th Air Force Club on Section 4 of Roosevelt Road, and at the Grand Hotel Taipei, which houses Americans, groups of U.S. military officers and soldiers, American diplomats, economic personnel, and consultants danced the A-go-go and the jitterbug after drinking heavily. Taipei's restaurants, bars, and "American Soldier Paradise" (military brothels) were also bustling, filled with the laughter and whistles of American soldiers.
    American invaders squander the blood and sweat money plundered from the Taiwanese people, living a licentious and shameless life. The *Ching Shin News* in Taipei said that a group of officers and soldiers from the U.S. military assistance advisory group in Taiwan organized a "Gluttony Party." "This gathering, dedicated to eating, aims to sample all kinds of local Taiwanese delicacies. They have many gimmicks during the meals. They strike a chime when eating and bang a gong when they stop. During a meal, the chime and gong sound very lively. These American soldiers, indulging in gluttony, often gobble down food in Taiwanese restaurants." Taiwanese newspapers say that not only do Americans in Taiwan "eat happily and drink comfortably," but even their pet cats and dogs are "well taken care of."
    
    Abandoned Infants and Starving Corpses
    According to a report from the Chiang Kai-shek group's Taipei City Police Department published in Taiwanese newspapers, four residents of Taipei committed suicide on Christmas night due to a lack of means to survive. More suicides than before also occurred in other parts of Taiwan in December. For example, Zhou Junying, a 34-year-old young man originally from Hunan, committed suicide in Hualien County by lying on the railway tracks due to unemployment; Wen Xinmei, a Gaoshan (aboriginal) girl from Taitung County, committed suicide by poisoning; and Huang Yiyong, a 19-year-old Taiwanese youth, died by poisoning himself in Shoushan Park in Kaohsiung. A suicide note found on his body by the police stated, "I am a tramp, a person with nowhere to turn."
    Incidents of selling children and abandoning infants continue to occur throughout Taiwan. On December 21, the *Ching Shin News* in Taipei published a news item titled "Struggling on the Poverty Line, a Two-Year-Old Boy is Given Away," stating that Chiang's army "retiree Shi Shenghua is ill, and because his wife and children have no means of support, he wants to give his two-year-old son to a kind-hearted person to raise. Shi Shenghua often feels that life is inadequate. He built a small shed to live in, and whenever there is wind and rain, the room is completely unable to block it. He hopes to find a kind-hearted person to adopt his young son and also hopes that this kind-hearted person can build a small cottage for them to shelter from the wind and rain." The next day, the *Min Tsu Evening News* in Taipei published another news item titled "No Money to Sell Her Own Daughter, the Sorrowful Tears of a Loving Mother," stating that "Li Liu Wang, a disheveled, poorly dressed, weak, and sorrowful mother," collapsed in front of the Chiang Kai-shek group's Tamsui Township Police Department in Taipei County, crying bitterly. The reason was that her husband, "because life was unbearable," had secretly sold her two daughters, aged twelve and ten, without her knowledge. She asked the police to help her find her daughters and cried, "I don't know where my beloved daughters are now? If they can't be found, the Tamsui River will be my final resting place (meaning she would commit suicide by drowning)." Three days later, on December 23, the social news section of the *United Daily News* in Taipei published two tragic news items and photos of abandoned infants. The newspaper said, "Whose child is this? So beautiful and cute, but abandoned by his parents in a culvert near Xizhi Township, Taipei County. This poor child is constantly calling for his mother."
    Taiwanese newspapers reported that Chen Zhongyun, a 74-year-old man, and Hong Mingshan, a two-year-old boy, both starved to death by a ditch on the same day, December 22, in Yuli Township, Hualien County.
    
    People Who Sell Blood
    In a news item titled "The Story of Drinking Human Blood" in the *United Daily News* in Taipei on December 24, it said that according to the regulations of various hospitals in Taiwan, people who sell blood are only allowed to register to sell blood once every two months, each time selling 250 cc of blood. However, due to the control of the underworld, many blood sellers have blood drawn several times a month, with the highest record being 3,000 cc of blood in one month. Blood sellers are originally poor people who are already malnourished. In addition to selling large amounts of blood, most of them end up with yellow faces, emaciated bodies, and are on the verge of death. However, the hospitals give them NT$200 for every 100 cc of blood, and the underworld deducts NT$30 as an "introduction fee." The *Cheng Kung Evening News* in Tainan City said, "There are all kinds of industries in the world, but relying on selling one's own blood in exchange for two meals should be considered the most unique industry.
    Currently, a large number of people rise early and line up at various large and small hospitals in Taipei, waiting to use their own blood in an attempt to exchange it for a thin stack of banknotes to maintain their own lives and the lives of their families. Preliminary estimates show that there are about 4,000 people in Taipei City. If amateur blood sellers are included, the total number is more than 20,000."

    台湾残年景象
    古凡
    美军“饕餮会”
    12月25日，台北市报纸登载了许多在台湾的美国人和“高等华人”庆祝“圣诞节”的消息。在台北圆山忠烈路美军六三俱乐部，在中山北路三段美军军官俱乐部，在罗斯福路四段美国空军第十三航空队俱乐部，在接待美国人居住的台北圆山大饭店等处，一群群酗酒后的美军官兵和美国外交官员、经济人员和顾问之流，跳着阿飞舞和摇摆舞。台北市接待美国人的酒家、酒吧和“美军乐园”（军妓院）等处，也是人声鼎沸，喧闹着美国大兵的狂笑声和口哨声。
    美国侵略人员挥霍着从台湾人民身上劫掠得来的血汗钱，过着荒淫无耻的生活。台北市《征信新闻报》说，美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团的一批官兵，组织了一个“饕餮会”，这个“专以吃为目的的集会要吃遍台湾各种具有地方特性的佳肴美食，他们聚餐时的噱头很多，吃菜时就敲磬，停止吃菜时便打锣，一餐饭的中途，磬鸣锣响，十分热闹。这些大吃特吃的美国官兵，常常在台湾各酒家狼吞虎咽，大嚼特吃”。台湾报纸说，不光是美国人在台湾“吃得痛快，喝得舒服”，连他们豢养的猫狗也都“养尊处优”。
    弃婴和饿殍
    据台湾报纸刊载的蒋介石集团台北市警察局报告，圣诞节之夜，台北市区内因求生无门而自杀的市民就有四人。台湾其它各地在12月间也发生了比从前更多的自杀案件，如今年三十四岁原籍湖南的青年周俊英在花莲县因失业卧倒在铁路轨道上自杀；台东县高山族少女温新妹服毒自杀；十九岁的台湾籍青年黄义勇在高雄市寿山公园服毒自杀死去后，警察从他身上搜出的一封遗书上说：“我是一个流浪汉，是一个走投无路的人”。
    台湾各地发现的卖儿卖女和抛弃婴孩的事件，也不断发生。12月21日，台北市《征信新闻报》以“挣扎贫病线上割让两岁男婴”为题发表消息说，蒋军“退役军人石生华患病，因妻子及儿女生活无着，欲送两岁儿子给善心人抚养。石生华生活常感不济，他搭了一个小棚子居住，每当风雨交加之际，室内根本无法遮挡风雨。他希望找一位善心人收养小儿子，同时希望这位善心人能为他们盖一间小茅屋以避风雨。”次日，台北市《民族晚报》以“无钱卖亲女，哀哀慈母泪”为标题，刊出了另一条消息说，“一个蓬头垢面，衣着褴褛，弱不经风，愁容满面的思雏病妇李刘罔”，倒在蒋介石集团台北县淡水镇警察分局门前抱头痛哭，原因是她的丈夫“由于生活难挨”，竟瞒着她把两个十二岁和十岁的亲生女卖去，她要求警方替她把女儿寻回，并且痛哭着说：“现在不知爱女在哪里？如果她们找不回来，淡水河将是我的归宿（就是投河自杀）。”第三天，12月23日，台北市《联合报》的社会新闻版上，刊出两则弃婴的悲惨消息和照片。这家报纸说，“这是谁家的孩子，长得清秀可爱，但是却被父母遗弃在台北县汐止镇附近的一个涵洞里。这个可怜的孩子，时时在喊着他的妈妈。”
    台湾报纸报道，在花莲县玉里镇，七十四岁的老翁陈中允和两岁的男孩洪明善，都在12月22日同一天饿死在沟渠旁。
    卖血的人
    台北市《联合报》在12月24日一则题为《喝人血的故事》的消息中说，依照台湾各医院的规定，卖血的人每满两个月才准登记卖血一次，每次卖血二百五十西西，但是，由于黑社会的包揽，许多卖血的人每月抽血数次，最高纪录有一个月卖血三千西西的。卖血者本来都是贫穷的人们，平日已经营养不良，加上大量卖血，因此绝大部分人都弄得脸黄饥瘦，奄奄一息。但是，医院给他们每一百西西台币二百元的血钱，还被黑社会克扣了台币三十元的“介绍费”。台南市《成功晚报》说，“世界上形形色色的行业都有，但靠出卖自己的鲜血，以换取二餐的，应该算是最奇特的行业了。
    目前，一些黎明即起，排列在台北各大小医院，等候用自己的鲜血，企图换取一叠薄薄的钞票，来维持自己及一家大小生活的人，为数甚多。初步估计，台北市大约有四千人，如果连同业余的卖血者，总数有二万多人。”
