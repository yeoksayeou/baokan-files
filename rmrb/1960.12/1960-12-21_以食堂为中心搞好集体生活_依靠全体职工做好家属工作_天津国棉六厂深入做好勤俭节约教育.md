    This newspaper reports: The Tianjin State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 6 Party Committee, while taking the canteen as the center to improve the collective life of employees, goes deep into the employee family dormitories and conscientiously does a good job in family work, making the work of arranging employee life more comprehensive, in-depth, and meticulous.
    The Party Committee of this factory pays great attention to mobilizing and relying on all employees to do a good job in family work. In the past, some employees believed that "family life is trivial, a matter for women," and were unwilling to get involved, often because family life was not well arranged, affecting the production and life of employees. In response to this situation, the Party Committee repeatedly educated the employees, and many groups also launched debates around the question of "Why should family life be arranged well?" so that everyone was more consciously aware of arranging family life. From the factory level, workshops, teams, and groups, all included the arrangement of employee family life in their work plans, established special organizations or assigned special personnel to be responsible for this work. Many employees have formulated family life plans, and often conduct inspections and exchange experiences at group meetings. Cadre Zheng Mancheng responded to the Party Committee's call to do a good job in family work, and held several family meetings in succession, patiently explaining the principles of building the country through diligence and thrift and managing the household diligently and thriftily, and democratically agreed on the family living expenses plan. Now, this family is living a good life, changing from "relaxed at the beginning of the month and tight at the end of the month" to having a surplus every month. Since October, they have been able to save ten yuan a month.
    The factory leaders also go deep into the families to strengthen the ideological and political education of the family members. Cadres go deep into employee family dormitories, hold small meetings by district, and talk to employee family members about the excellent domestic and international situation, and the significance of building the country through diligence and thrift and managing the household diligently and thriftily. When the factory held the "Exhibition Before and After Liberation," the Party Committee also organized family members to visit, and helped them recall the bitter days before liberation, see the sweet days after liberation, and look forward to the happy days in the future. Through these educations, family members' minds were opened up, they stood taller, saw further, and expressed their willingness to respond to the Party's call to achieve diligence and thrift in managing the household and building the country. Employee family member Auntie Man, in the discussion, recalled her bitter days before liberation when she didn't wear cotton clothes for three winters and her family of seven shared one cotton quilt. She compared it with today's situation where everyone in the family has a job and lives a life of plenty. She said, "Thinking about the suffering of the past can truly appreciate the sweetness of today. Today, we work hard and practice diligence and thrift for a happier tomorrow."
    The factory Party Committee also mobilized Party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and veteran workers to cooperate with the backbone members of the family to understand the employee's family life, plan for grain use, and prepare for winter through the method of contracting by district and visiting households. The wife of Jin Guichen, a worker in the combing group, used to have no plans for her life, and often had the phenomenon of being loose at the beginning and tight at the end. Yan Shufen, the group's welfare officer, visited her three times in a row, chatted with her, explained to her the principle of "eating doesn't make you poor, wearing doesn't make you poor, not calculating will make you poor for life," and helped her and her husband calculate carefully and make a life plan. Jin Guichen's family life changed quickly. Now, life is planned by the month and arranged by the day, and the small life is prosperous. Jin Guichen was so moved that he said, "The Party not only worries about the big days of 600 million people all day long, but also cares about the small days of every family. It really cares for us meticulously." Through visits, they found that some employee families had some specific difficulties, so they mobilized the masses to help solve them. For example, in the household visits, the preparation workshop found that some families had both husband and wife working, and there were only the elderly and young children at home, making it very inconvenient to go out to buy things. The workshop set up a life service station to buy oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, and daily necessities on behalf of the family, and contacted the grain store to deliver grain to the door on time. Since the beginning of winter, they have also investigated the winter preparations of employee families twice, and helped some family members dismantle and wash clothes and install stoves, which was welcomed by the family members.
    The factory Party Committee also closely cooperated with the commune Party Committee, promptly summarized the experience of family members in living diligently and thriftily, erected red flags, and established pacesetters. They summarized the experience of cadre Lu Xueming and worker Wang Yuqing's family members in facing production, diligence, and thrift in managing the household, held on-site meetings, and disseminated and promoted them. At the same time, the factory also sent cooks and administrators to go deep into the family dormitory areas, using literary and technical performances to publicize the significance and specific methods of planned grain use and saving grain to family members, which was also welcomed by family members. Many family members reflected: These methods of diligence and thrift are really "family heirlooms." If used all year round, life will get better and better. At present, family members often gather in twos and threes to study and exchange experiences in diligence and thrift. (Attached picture)

    以食堂为中心搞好集体生活　依靠全体职工做好家属工作
    天津国棉六厂深入做好勤俭节约教育
    本报讯　天津国棉六厂党委在以食堂为中心搞好职工集体生活的同时，深入职工家属宿舍，认真做好家属工作，使安排职工生活的工作更全面、更深入、更细致。
    这个厂党委很注意发动和依靠全体职工做好家属工作。过去，有的职工认为“家庭生活小事，婆婆妈妈”，不愿过问，往往因为家属生活安排不好，影响职工的生产和生活。党委针对这种情况，反复地向职工进行了教育，很多小组还围绕着“为什么要安排好家庭生活？”等问题展开辩论，使大家都更加自觉地注意安排好家庭生活。从厂级、车间、班、组都把安排职工家属生活列入自己的工作规划，成立专门组织或抽出专人负责这项工作。很多职工都订出了家庭生活计划，并且经常在小组生活会上进行检查和交流经验。干部郑满成响应党委做好家属工作的号召，连续召开了几次家庭会议，耐心讲述勤俭建国、勤俭持家的道理，民主议定家庭生活开支计划。现在，这个家庭生活过得很好，由“月初松、月末紧”变为月月有富余，10月份以来，每月都能储蓄十元钱。
    这个厂领导上还深入到家属中去，加强对家属的思想政治教育工作。干部们深入到职工家属宿舍，分片召开小型会议，对职工家属大讲国内外大好形势，大讲勤俭建国、勤俭持家的意义。厂里举办“解放前后展览会”的时候，党委还组织家属参观，并且帮助他们回忆解放前的苦日子，看看解放后的甜日子，展望将来的幸福日子。通过这些教育使得家属们心胸豁然开朗，站得高、看得远了，纷纷表示响应党的号召，做到勤俭持家、勤俭建国。职工家属满大嫂，在讨论中，回忆了自己在解放前三冬没穿上棉衣服、全家七口人盖一床棉被的苦日子，跟今天全家人人有工作，过着丰衣足食的生活作了对比，她说：“想想过去的苦，才能真正体会今天的甜，今天我们艰苦奋斗、勤俭节约，正是为了更加幸福的明天。”
    工厂党委还发动党团员和老工人，配合家属中的骨干分子，采取分片包干、入户访问的办法，了解职工家庭生活、计划用粮、过冬准备等情况，帮助家属做好具体安排。并条小组工人金贵臣的爱人，过去过日子没有计划，经常出现前松后紧现象。小组生活福利员阎淑芬连续三次登门访问，跟她聊天，向她讲解“吃不穷、穿不穷、计算不到一世穷”的道理，并且协助她夫妻俩算细账，制定生活计划。金贵臣的家庭生活很快变样了，现在做到过日子月有计划，日有安排，小日子富富裕裕。金贵臣感动得直说：“党不仅整天为六亿人民的大日子操心，还为每个家庭的小日子操心，真是对我们关怀得无微不至。”通过访问，发现有的职工家庭生活有些具体困难，他们就发动群众帮助解决。像准备车间在家庭访问中，发现有的家庭夫妻双方都工作，家中只有老幼，外出买东西很不方便。车间就设立了一个生活服务站，代买油盐酱醋和生活日用品，并且跟粮店联系，按期把粮食送上门。入冬以来，他们还先后两次调查了职工家庭的过冬准备情况，帮助一部分家属拆洗衣服、安装炉子，受到家属们的欢迎。
    厂党委还密切配合公社党委，及时总结家属中勤俭节约过日子的经验，大插红旗，大树标兵。他们总结了干部卢学明、工人王玉清的家属面向生产、勤俭持家的经验，召开现场会议，传播推广。同时，厂里还派出炊事员、管理员，深入到家属宿舍区，用文艺和技术表演等形式，向家属宣传计划用粮、节约用粮的意义和具体做法，也深受家属们欢迎。很多家属都反映：这些勤俭节约的办法，真是“传家宝”，常年使用，日子就会越过越好。目前，家属当中常常三两个人凑在一起研究、交流勤俭节约的经验。（附图片）
