    Socialist countries are sincere and faithful friends of the people who are striving for liberation or have already freed themselves from imperialist enslavement and oppression. They fundamentally oppose any act of interfering in the internal affairs of young national states, and they regard promoting the struggle of all peoples to consolidate national independence as their international obligation.

    社会主义国家是正在争取解放或者已经摆脱了帝国主义奴役和压迫的人民的真诚的和忠实的朋友。它们根本反对任何干涉年轻的民族国家内政的行为，它们认为促进各国人民争取巩固民族独立的斗争是自己的国际义务。
