Yunmiao of Yun County, Guizhou Expands Rape Planting Area
More than 3 million mu of rape planted early in Guizhou Plateau generally have five or six true leaves. Currently, people's communes in various places are combining the seedling-stage field management of rape with timely thinning and transplanting of seedlings, striving to plant more rape.

Thinning and transplanting rape seedlings is a good way to kill two birds with one stone. It can not only save labor and improve field management, but also adapt to the natural conditions of lower temperatures in early winter, effectively expanding the planting area.

Anhui Promotes Multi-Pot Backdraft Stove
Various places in Anhui Province are promoting multi-pot backdraft stoves, which not only save a lot of fuel and labor, but also improve the sanitary conditions of the canteens.

The multi-pot backdraft stove was successfully trial-produced in Taihe County, Anhui Province. It is fuel-efficient, labor-saving, safe, and hygienic. This kind of backdraft stove can simultaneously perform a variety of tasks such as stir-frying, cooking rice, and boiling water, and also greatly reduces the labor intensity of cooks.

Nanchong Area Achieves Great Results in Minor Autumn Harvest
After the autumn harvest and autumn planting were basically completed, Nanchong Area, Sichuan Province, closely combined with the field management of early spring crops and the accumulation and production of fertilizer, and launched a mass movement of vigorously carrying out the "minor autumn harvest" throughout the area, marching in ten directions: peeling cotton stalks, collecting wild five treasures, collecting domestic and wild medicinal materials, catching adult fish in large quantities, raising poultry and livestock well, recovering various fruits, raising autumn silkworms well, engaging in short-distance transportation in a big way, engaging in agricultural product processing in a big way, and actively developing handicraft side-occupations. At present, this movement has achieved great results. According to incomplete statistics, more than two million catties of tung seeds have been picked throughout the area, and many cotton, cotton bolls, sweet potatoes, and sweet potato stems have been recovered, and 150,000 catties of cotton stalks have been peeled.

Arrange Re-harvesting According to the Characteristics of Winter
Recently, the Party Committee of Gao Village Commune in Wendeng County, Shandong Province, studied the methods of re-harvesting and re-threshing according to the characteristics of changeable and increasingly cold weather in winter. It was decided to re-harvest eastern slopes and sunny places in the morning, and re-harvest flatlands in the afternoon; re-harvest shady hillsides on warm days, and re-harvest sunny hillsides on cold days. At the same time, comprehensive arrangements were made for labor and reasonable remuneration methods were stipulated. In this way, the enthusiasm of the commune members for re-harvesting was further mobilized, and great achievements were made.

Antu Forest Farms Combine Forestry with Agriculture
There are currently fourteen state-owned forest farms in Antu County, Jilin Province. Since this year, 38 hectares of wasteland have been used to grow grain crops, producing more than 150,000 catties of corn, soybeans, and millet; 25 hectares have been used to grow livestock feed crops, producing 200,000 catties of feed; and 32 hectares have been used to grow vegetables, producing about 400,000 catties of autumn vegetables such as cabbage and radishes. Each employee (excluding temporary workers) produces an average of more than 680 catties of grain. There are more than 2,000 employees and family members in the county's forest farms, and they are self-sufficient in vegetables, meat, eggs and other non-staple foods, with a surplus.

Scientifically Arrange Farm Work and Rationally Use Labor
Cadres of the Fourth Team of the United Production Team of Xiannv Commune in Yidu County, Hubei Province, grasp the laws of nature, are familiar with the specialties of commune members, carry forward the working style of the mass line, scientifically arrange farm work, rationally use labor, achieve "skillful use of soldiers," and improve labor efficiency, saving labor.

The farm work of this team is not only arranged in advance in everything, but also fully estimates the changes in nature and makes several sets of arrangements. In the use of labor, the combination of "assigning tasks according to people" and "assigning people according to tasks" is achieved. Weak laborers are not sent to do the work that strong laborers can do. And pay attention to the close connection between various types of work and various processes, so as to avoid delays and be proactive in everything.
