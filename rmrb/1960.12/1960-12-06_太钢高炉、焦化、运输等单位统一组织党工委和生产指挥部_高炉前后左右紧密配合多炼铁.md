Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, December 5th: Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, with the blast furnace as the center, formed a Party Working Committee and Production Headquarters with various auxiliary units such as coking, transportation, power, and machine repair, making these units a production whole from a general cooperative relationship, further meeting the needs of ironmaking production.

Blast furnace production involves auxiliary production departments and comprehensive service units such as coking, mining, transportation, power, and machinery repair. In the production process, they are actually an organic whole centered on the blast furnace. However, in the past, in terms of production management, they were independent units, and some key issues in ironmaking production were sometimes not easy to solve or could not be solved quickly. After forming the Ironmaking Party Working Committee and Production Headquarters in August under the leadership of the company's Party committee, they continuously organized battles to repair equipment and solve raw material problems, achieving good results. For example, in overcoming the equipment maintenance hurdle, in addition to supplying sufficient spare parts for the blast furnace's "three openings" (tuyere, taphole, slag notch), the machine repair shop also overhauled the four major auxiliary equipment such as cranes, electric bulbs, plugging machines, and opening machines, basically eliminating the phenomenon of the blast furnace being affected by equipment problems. After the spare parts and auxiliary equipment maintenance problems were solved, the slow turnover of slag pots and iron pots became the main contradiction. Duan Jirui, Secretary of the Ironmaking System Party Working Committee, organized workers from various types of work such as furnace workers, slag removal workers, pig casting machine workers, and machine repair workers to carry out joint technical performance competitions to ensure rapid slag removal by the slag removal section and accelerate the turnover of molten iron pots.

Under the unified leadership of the Party Working Committee and the Headquarters, the workers of the various auxiliary departments such as coke, iron, mining, and transportation, and the workers of the ironmaking plant formed a unified whole, which made it easier to carry out "one-dragon" competitions according to the production system. In order to allow the blast furnace to smoothly implement the technical policies of fine materials, high temperature, and large air volume, the Party secretaries and directors of coking plants, transportation departments, and other units all led workers to visit the blast furnace to solicit opinions from ironmaking workers and improve their work. According to the opinions and requirements of the blast furnace workers to improve the quality of coke, the coking plant workers carried out technical performances on a large scale, improved coal blending and coke output methods, and strengthened furnace maintenance, which greatly improved the strength of coke, and greatly reduced the coke ash content and sulfur content, creating conditions for high-yield and high-quality blast furnace production.

Realizing the centralized leadership and unified command of the company's Party committee over the ironmaking system in the form of the Party Working Committee and Production Headquarters also strengthened the daily production scheduling work of the ironmaking system. When problems are discovered, the forces of all parties can be immediately organized to solve them quickly. Recently, more than 3,000 workers participated in the emergency repair of large blast furnaces, including production workers, basic construction workers, and machine repair workers. Although there are many types of work, due to unified leadership, the entire emergency repair work was arranged in an orderly manner, and the blast furnace was repaired ahead of schedule.

    太钢高炉、焦化、运输等单位统一组织党工委和生产指挥部
    高炉前后左右紧密配合多炼铁
    据新华社太原5日电　太原钢铁公司以高炉为中心，把焦化、运输、动力、机修等各个辅助单位，组成炼铁系统党的工作委员会和生产指挥部，使这几个单位，由一般的协作关系变成了一个生产整体，进一步符合了炼铁生产的需要。
    高炉生产牵连着炼焦、矿山、运输、动力、机械修配等辅助生产部门和综合服务单位。在生产过程中，它们实际是以高炉为中心的一个有机的整体。但是过去在生产管理上，它们都是独立的单位，对炼铁生产中有些关键问题，有时就不容易解决，或不能迅速解决。8月份他们在公司党委领导下组成炼铁党工委和生产指挥部以后，针对生产关键，连续组织了设备维修和解决原料问题的战役，收到了良好的效果。如在攻克设备维修关当中，机修厂除为高炉“三口”（风口、铁口、渣口）供应足够的备品备件外，还检修好天车、电泡、堵口机、开口机等四大辅助设备，使高炉基本上消除了因设备问题影响正常生产的现象。备品备件和辅助设备的维修问题解决以后，渣罐、铁罐周转不开又成了主要矛盾。炼铁系统党工委书记段集锐就组织炉前工、清渣工、铸铁机工、机修工等各工种职工，开展联合技术表演赛，保证了清渣工段快速清渣，加快了铁水罐的周转。
    在党工委和指挥部统一领导下，焦、铁、矿、运等各个辅助部门职工同炼铁厂职工结成了统一的整体，更便于按生产体系，开展
  “一条龙”竞赛。为了让高炉顺利地贯彻精料、高温、大风等技术方针，焦化厂、运输部等单位的党委书记、厂长都带领工人到高炉前访问，征求炼铁工人意见，改进自己的工作。焦化厂职工根据高炉工人改进焦炭质量的意见和要求，大搞技术表演，改进配煤、出焦方法，加强炉体维护，使焦炭强度大大提高，焦炭灰分、硫分也大大降低，为高炉高产优质创造了条件。
    以党工委、生产指挥部形式来实现公司党委对炼铁系统的集中领导和统一指挥，也加强了炼铁系统日常的生产调度工作。发现问题，就能立即组织各方面的力量迅速解决。最近参加抢修大型高炉的职工有三千多名，其中有生产工人、基本建设工人和机修工。虽然工种繁多，但是由于有了统一领导，整个抢修工作安排得有条不紊，高炉竟提前修好。（附图片）
