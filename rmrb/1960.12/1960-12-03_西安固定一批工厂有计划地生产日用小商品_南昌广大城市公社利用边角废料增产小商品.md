Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an Dispatch: Xi'an City has designated a group of urban commune industries and city- and district-affiliated industries to systematically produce small daily-use goods, enabling the rapid increase and improvement of the output, quality, and variety of these goods. Currently, the city has designated 215 factories to produce small goods, with over 2,000 varieties, an increase of 30% compared to before the planning, and the output has generally increased by about 50% compared to the past.

    In order to further develop the production of small commodities systematically, the Xi'an Municipal Planning Commission, Economic Commission, Light Industry Bureau, Handicraft Industry Bureau, Commerce Bureau, and other units have specially formed a small commodity production planning office to conduct a comprehensive investigation and research on the products, equipment, technology, and raw material supply of commune industries and city- and district-affiliated industries. At the same time, they assessed market needs. Then, according to the production conditions of each factory and market needs, they made plans and adopted the method of designating factories, personnel, equipment, and tasks (the variety, quantity, and quality of products), and establishing supply and sales relationships to produce small goods. In the plan, based on the characteristic that small commodities mainly use scraps and waste materials for production, raw material processing factories such as rolling, wire drawing, waste oil refining, waste product processing, and waste metal smelting were systematically established.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang Dispatch: The broad urban people's communes of Nanchang City are actively developing the production of small commodities by utilizing the scraps and waste materials from large factories, increasing the variety of small commodity products produced by commune-run industries from the original 70-odd to nearly 400. Among them, many products were not previously produced in Nanchang City.

    The broad communes have successively established cooperative relationships with more than a dozen nearby large state-owned factories to collect scraps and waste materials. Using these scraps and waste materials, they carefully calculate and skillfully tailor, process, and produce a large number of useful small commodities. Commune-run factories use the large pieces of cloth scraps left over from the Hua'an Underwear Factory to make children's clothing, and the small pieces of cloth scraps to make shoe uppers; even smaller pieces of cloth are used to pad the soles of shoes; and the remaining cloth strips are processed into recycled cotton, which is then used to spin yarn and weave cloth to make very good sofa covers. They use waste yarn collected from textile factories to spin synthetic thread and also make very good cool cloth shoes. In terms of iron, wood, and hardware, commune-run industries have a wider range of comprehensive utilization. They use larger scrap iron plates and iron sheets that are not used by state-owned steel factories, hardware factories, and cannery factories to make rice cookers, smaller ones to make rice spoons, and scattered pieces to make soup spoons or corner nails for boxes; waste iron wires are used to make mousetraps and nails, and the remaining iron wire ends are used to make shoelace tips, turning a large amount of scraps and waste materials from useless to useful and from small use to large use.

    西安固定一批工厂有计划地生产日用小商品
    南昌广大城市公社利用边角废料增产小商品
    据新华社西安电　西安市固定一批城市公社工业和市、区属工业有计划地生产日用小商品，使小商品的产量、质量和品种迅速增加和提高。目前，全市已经指定二百一十五个工厂生产小商品，品种达二千多种，比规划以前增加30％，产量一般也比过去增长50％左右。
    为了进一步有计划的发展小商品生产，西安市计划委员会、经济委员会、轻工业局、手工业局、商业局等单位专门组成小商品生产规划办公室，对公社工业和市、区属工业的产品、设备、技术、原料供应等情况进行了全面调查研究；同时对市场需要摸了底。然后根据各厂的生产条件和市场需要作出规划，采用定工厂、定人员、定设备、定任务（产品的品种、数量和质量）、定供销关系的办法生产小商品。在规划中，还根据小商品主要利用下脚料、废料生产的特点，有计划地建立了压延、拔丝、废油提炼、废品加工、废金属冶炼等原料材料加工工厂。
    据新华社南昌电　南昌市广大城市人民公社利用大工厂的边角废料积极发展小商品生产，使社办工业的小商品产品由原来的七十多种增加到近四百种。其中，许多产品是南昌市过去没有生产过的。
    广大公社先后与附近十多个国营大工厂建立了收取边角废料的协作关系，用这些边角废料，精算巧裁，加工处理，做出大批适用的小商品。社办工厂利用华安内衣厂剩下的大块布角做成童装，小块布角做成鞋面；再小的布块垫鞋底；最后剩下的布条经过加工成为再生棉，用再生棉纺纱织布又做出了很好的沙发套。他们利用从纺织厂收取的废纱，纺成合成线，也做出了很好的凉布鞋。在铁木、五金方面，社办工业综合利用的范围更广。他们利用国营钢铁厂、五金厂、罐头厂等工厂不用的较大的废铁板、铁皮做成饭锅，小些的做成饭勺，零零碎碎的做成汤匙或者箱子角上的包钉；用废铁丝制成老鼠夹子、钉子，剩下的铁丝梢制成鞋带头，使大量边角废料变无用为有用、变小用成大用。
