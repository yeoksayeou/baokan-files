    Poet Meets Readers at "Poetry" Bookstore
    Soviet poets Tikhonov, Inber, Shepachev, and others recently proposed opening a "Poetry" bookstore in Moscow, so that poets can have daily contact and conversations with the masses. In addition to allowing poets to conduct ideological and aesthetic propaganda, it can also be a place to listen to readers' opinions and answer readers' questions.
    According to past practice, during this year's annual "Poetry Festival" (October 9th), poets met with readers in twenty-seven bookstores in Moscow, and then, for a whole week, met with the masses in factory workshops, libraries, and public squares. In order to further increase the connection between poets and readers, they proposed opening a "Poetry" bookstore.

    诗人到“诗歌”书店会见读者
    苏联诗人吉洪诺夫、英倍尔、谢帕切夫等人最近提议在莫斯科开办一所“诗歌”书店，使诗人每天都能和群众接触、交谈。除了让诗人进行思想和美学宣传外，还可以在这里听取读者意见、解答读者问题。
    按照过去的惯例，今年诗人们在一年一度的“诗歌节”（十月九日）曾分别在莫斯科二十七家书店与读者会见，并且在以后一整个星期内到工厂车间、图书馆和大街的广场上会见广大群众。为了进一步增多诗人与读者的联系，他们提出了开办“诗歌”书店的建议。
