Xinhua News Agency, Washington, December 8th: United States Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Merchant yesterday advocated using the expansion of U.S. dumping in the capitalist world market to resolve the U.S. international payments crisis.

In a speech to the National Export Expansion Council, a private U.S. business group, Merchant expressed opposition to reducing U.S. foreign "aid" programs and plans for other military build-up activities abroad in order to alleviate the U.S. international balance of payments deficit. Addressing those who called for cuts in these programs, he pointed out that most of the funds for the "common security" program, which the U.S. uses to coerce its allies into military build-up activities, are "spent in the United States," and that "reducing overseas programs essential to national security is also an unrealistic approach." Merchant also said that "restricting private capital flows to foreign countries or restricting U.S. citizens from traveling abroad violates the concept of America's free enterprise economy." Merchant emphasized that "a major factor that has proven helpful in improving our (U.S.) trade balance is the dismantling by our friends and allies of barriers to the import of American goods." This means opening the door to U.S. dumping by its allies.

    美国要以倾销政策解救美元危机
    麦钱特鼓吹扩大美国输出缓和国际支付逆差
    新华社8日讯　华盛顿消息：美国负责政治事务的副国务卿麦钱特昨天鼓吹用扩大美国在资本主义世界市场上倾销的办法来解救美国的国际支付危机。
    麦钱特在向美国的一个私人企业团体——全国输出扩大委员会发表讲话时，表示反对为了缓和美国国际支付逆差而削减美国的对外“援助”计划和在国外进行其他扩军备战活动的计划。他针对要求削减这些计划的人指出，美国用来胁迫它的盟国进行扩军备战的“共同安全”计划的大部分款项，都是“在美国花费掉的”，而“缩减对国家安全所必需的海外计划也是一种不现实的作法。”麦钱特还说，“限制私人资本流向外国或限制美国公民到国外去旅行，是违反美国的自由企业经济的概念的”。麦钱特强调，“业已表明有助于改进我们（美国）贸易差额的一个主要因素，是我们的朋友和盟国拆除对美国商品输入的壁垒”。这就是说，要盟国为美国的倾销敞开大门。
