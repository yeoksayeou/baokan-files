    Concentrate Efforts on Improving Coal Transport

    With the development of socialist construction, China's coal production has greatly increased, and at the same time, the needs of all aspects of the national economy for coal have also greatly increased. The importance of coal in our production activities and daily life is becoming more and more prominent.

    Production determines distribution; only when coal mines produce more coal can they better meet the needs of all parties. But this is not the only factor. Because coal is large in volume and heavy in weight, and the distance between production sites and usage sites is very long, transportation has become a very important link in coal supply work. Hundreds of millions of tons of coal are transported across long distances by train and ship to users every year. Therefore, to grasp coal, we must first grasp production and second grasp transportation, both of which are indispensable and must be grasped tightly.

    The raw coal produced by the vast majority of large coal mines and many small and medium-sized coal mines is transported by rail. Among the various material transportation tasks undertaken by railways, coal accounts for the largest amount. Therefore, coal transportation has become the railway's primary task. In the process of completing this task, a lot of experience has been accumulated over the years, the most important of which is to concentrate forces to fight battles of annihilation.

    In economic work, the so-called concentration of forces not only refers to the concentration of material forces, but also includes the concentration of the wisdom and strength of the masses, and the concentration of leadership's energy. The concentration of leadership's energy is the decisive link in whether all forces can be concentrated. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The leaders of any level should focus their attention on the most important and decisive problems or actions for the overall situation they command, and not on other problems or actions." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume 1, pp. 169-170) Leaders at all levels on the railway transportation front should focus their attention on the key issue concerning the overall situation—coal transportation. They should concentrate their main energy on the transportation of key materials from beginning to end, while appropriately arranging the transportation of non-key materials. To achieve this, we must also continuously strengthen ideological and political work among railway workers, stimulate the awareness of the vast number of cadres and masses to submit to the overall situation and ensure key points, and concentrate the wisdom and strength of the masses. This concentration of spiritual strength is a prerequisite for the concentration of material strength, and the key to whether the concentrated material strength can fully play its role.

    Whether the leadership's energy is concentrated and whether the wisdom and strength of the masses are concentrated cannot be judged only on the surface. The important thing is to examine the specific measures and their effects. The experiences of the Bengbu, Beijing, Jinzhou, and Jilin Railway Bureaus tell us that the reason why they have done a relatively good job in coal transportation is that they have used their main energy to go deep into the grassroots to understand the situation. Then, they concentrated their efforts on a series of links and adopted a series of specific measures, thus achieving better results. To transport coal from the place of production to the place of need requires a series of work. If forces are dispersed in any major link, the entire coal transportation will be affected. To do a good job in every link, the leadership cannot stay at general appeals, but must use its main energy practically on specific measures, and concentrate forces to implement these measures practically in every link. That is to say, concentrating forces and fighting battles of annihilation is a very specific and meticulous task that cannot be accomplished with just a little effort. We must truly spend 100% to 120% of our efforts to do many specific tasks well in order to achieve our goals.

    Of course, to improve coal transportation, it is also necessary for production departments to cooperate closely. While vigorously grasping raw coal production, coal mines should concentrate a certain amount of force to do a good job in the handling and loading of raw coal, and strive to gather the increased coke coal and stockpiled coal from the mines to railway or highway trunk lines in a timely manner for rapid external transfer. Coal-consuming units such as steel plants should further improve unloading and handling work in order to accelerate vehicle turnover.

    In addition to coal, a key material, railways also need to transport key materials such as grain, ore, pig iron, coke, refractory materials, petroleum, timber, agricultural machinery, and many daily necessities, while also taking into account the transportation of other non-key materials. How can we transport all these materials well? Concentrating forces to ensure key points is a good method. Starting from reality, arrange priorities according to the situation, concentrate forces to transport the most important and largest amount of materials first, and gain the initiative in decisive links, so that we can actively allocate appropriate forces to transport other materials. This is faster and better than using forces evenly. Therefore, conscientiously adopting the method of concentrating forces to fight battles of annihilation is an effective method for railway transportation to comprehensively complete transportation tasks with coal transportation as the center.

    The new year is coming soon. The development of all aspects of work requires more and more coal. Therefore, concentrating efforts to do a good job in coal transportation is a very important task for coal production and transportation departments, and requires redoubled efforts.

### 集中力量做好运煤工作

    集中力量做好运煤工作
    随着社会主义建设事业的发展，我国煤炭生产有了巨大的增长，同时国民经济各方面对煤炭的需要量也大大增长了。煤炭在我们的生产活动和日常生活中的重要性越来越突出。
    生产决定分配，只有煤矿多产煤，才能更好地满足各方面的需要。但这不是唯一的因素。由于煤炭量大、体重，以及生产地点和使用地点距离很长，运输就成了煤炭供应工作中一个十分重要的环节。全国每年有几亿吨的煤炭，需要火车、轮船经过长途运输运到使用者手里。所以抓煤炭，一要抓生产，二要抓运输，两者缺一不可，都要抓紧。
    全国绝大多数大型煤矿和许多中小型煤矿生产出的原煤，是通过铁路外运的。在铁路承担的各项物资运输任务中，煤炭的数量最大。因此，煤炭运输成了铁路运输的首要任务。在完成这项任务的过程中，几年来积累了很多的经验，其中最主要的一条，就是集中力量打歼灭战。
    在经济工作中，所谓集中力量，不仅是指集中物资力量，而且包括集中群众的智慧和力量，集中领导的精力。领导精力的集中是一切力量能否集中的决定性环节。毛泽东同志说：“任何一级的首长，应当把自己注意的重心，放在那些对于他所指挥的全局说来最重要最有决定意义的问题或动作上，而不应当放在其他的问题或动作上。”（《毛泽东选集》第一卷169—170页）铁路运输战线上的各级领导者，应当把自己注意的重心，放在关乎全局的关键性问题——煤炭运输上。应当自始至终地把主要精力集中在重点物资的运输上，同时又适当地安排好非重点物资的运输。要做到这一点，还要对铁路职工不断地加强思想政治工作，激发广大干部和群众服从全局、保证重点的自觉性，集中群众的智慧和力量。这种精神力量的集中，是物资力量集中的先决条件，是集中后的物资力量能否充分发挥作用的关键。
    领导的精力是不是集中了，群众的智慧和力量是不是集中了，不能只看表面，重要的是要考察具体措施和效果怎么样。蚌埠、北京、锦州、吉林等铁路局的经验告诉我们，他们的运煤工作所以做得比较好，就是因为他们用主要精力深入基层摸清情况，接着集中力量在一系列的环节上，采取了一系列的具体措施，因而取得了较好的效果。把煤炭从产地运到需要的地方，要经过一系列的工作，在任何一个主要环节上，分散了力量，都会使整个煤炭运输受到影响。要把每个环节的工作都做好，领导就不能停留在一般号召上，而必须把主要精力，扎扎实实地用在具体措施上，在每个环节都集中力量扎扎实实地实现这些措施。这就是说，集中力量，打歼灭战，是一项十分具体、细致的工作，不是花几分力量就能办好的，而必须切切实实地花十分十二分力量，做好许多具体工作，才能达到目的。
    当然，煤炭运输要搞好，还必须生产部门密切合作。煤矿在大抓原煤生产的同时，应当集中一定的力量搞好原煤的搬运、装车工作，力争把矿井增产的焦煤和存煤及时汇集到铁路或公路干线，以便迅速外调；钢铁厂等用煤单位应进一步做好卸车、搬运工作，以便加速车辆周转。
    铁路除了运煤炭这项重点物资以外，还要运粮食、矿石、生铁、焦炭、耐火材料、石油、木材、农业机具以及许多生活用品等重点物资，并兼顾其他非重点物资的运输。怎样把这些方面的物资都运好呢？集中力量保证重点就是一个好的方法。从实际出发，根据情况排好轻重缓急，集中力量首先把最重要最大量的物资运输好了，在决定性的环节上，取得主动权，就可以主动地配备适当的力量，运输其它物资。这样比起平均使用力量来，又快又好。所以说，认真采取集中力量打歼灭战的方法，是铁路运输以运煤为中心全面完成运输任务的有效方法。
    新的一年转瞬即到，各方面工作的发展，对于煤炭的需要量越来越大，因此集中力量做好运煤工作，是煤炭生产部门和运输部门的一个十分重要的任务，需要加倍努力做好。
