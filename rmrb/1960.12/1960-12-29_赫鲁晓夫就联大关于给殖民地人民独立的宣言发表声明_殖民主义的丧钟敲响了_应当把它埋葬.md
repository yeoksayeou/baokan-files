Xinhua News Agency, December 28th, Moscow dispatch from TASS: Soviet Premier Khrushchev issued a statement regarding the United Nations General Assembly's Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. The full text is as follows:

After lengthy and comprehensive discussions, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a historic resolution on December 14, 1960: the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. Representatives of the vast majority of countries in the world endorsed this resolution, proposed by forty-three independent Asian and African nations.

Representatives of eighty-nine countries voted in favor, and representatives of nine countries abstained. Not a single representative dared to oppose it. This is the result of a fierce political struggle, which unfolded not only at the United Nations General Assembly, but across the world, centering on the Soviet Union's proposal on this most pressing and significant issue of our time, which stirs hundreds of millions of people across continents.

Everyone remembers the intense and sharp debates that unfolded at the beginning of this session of the General Assembly, attended by many prominent national figures. After returning home from New York, I followed closely the tenacious struggle over the colonial issue. This struggle took place both within and outside the United Nations General Assembly.

Now that this important resolution has finally been adopted, the people of all countries can congratulate themselves on a great achievement.

The United Nations resolution, like the declaration proposed by the Soviet Union at the United Nations, is based on a major conclusion: colonialism in all its forms and manifestations must be eliminated most rapidly, thoroughly, and universally. Our proposal, imbued from beginning to end with the noble Leninist ideal of freedom, equality, and friendship among all nations and peoples, is reflected in essence in the United Nations resolution. Therefore, the Soviet declaration can be regarded as the political foundation of the United Nations resolution. Of course, the declaration adopted by the United Nations contains traces of certain compromises between the views of different countries. However, the substance of the document is expressed quite clearly.

Precisely because of this, there is reason to believe that the resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly is a great victory for those countries that take a consistent stand in the struggle for peace and the independence of all peoples. This is a great victory for the socialist countries, which consistently strive to achieve national liberation and national rejuvenation for the people of all oppressed countries; it is a great victory for the foreign policies of the independent countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America that oppose colonialism; and it is also a victory for the peace-loving and freedom-loving countries and forces of the West.

The very fact that the resolution was adopted by such a large majority says a lot. Those who abstained in the vote were only representatives of colonial countries (the abstention of the representative of the Dominican Republic's dictator cannot be taken seriously; it has no colonies and, in essence, is itself a colony. One must know that its current representative does not express the will of the Dominican people). It is now particularly evident how correct Lenin, the great friend of all oppressed nations, was when, half a century ago, he pointed out that those countries and individuals who are directly interested in continuing the colonial plunder and oppression of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are decreasing. How happy our beloved teacher and leader would be if he could see the thriving and rapid progress of the peoples of many countries, who yesterday were still in a state of being bullied and deprived of rights, but today have shaken off the shackles of colonialism and are developing their own independent nation-states.

The Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, adopted by the General Assembly, shows how the united front against the shameful shackles of colonialism is growing and strengthening in our era. It is natural and understandable that the people of socialist countries and the peoples of countries that recently freed themselves from colonial oppression are now opposing colonialism. Even many capitalist countries, such as Austria, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Canada, and New Zealand, have also endorsed the resolution on the elimination of colonialism.

All this illustrates the correctness of the Soviet assertion, including the assertion in our proposed declaration, that colonialism has become a heavy burden on all countries and peoples, that the death knell of colonialism has sounded, and that it should be buried.

The Soviet people wholeheartedly welcome the expansion of the front against colonialism. Because to eliminate colonialism, it is necessary not only to expose and eliminate it in the places where it carries out its criminal activities, that is, in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, but also in its lairs, in the places where it hoards what it plundered, that is, to expose colonialism in the lairs of colonialism – the metropolitan countries.

I believe that if the issue of the fate of the colonial system were voted on openly and fairly, not just in the halls of the United Nations General Assembly, but among the people of all countries, then even in some of the countries whose representatives abstained from voting on the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples at the General Assembly, the supporters of colonialism would not get the votes they need.

Colonial policies and the colonial system of exploitation only benefit and bring huge profits to a small number of capitalist monopolies and their servants who are entrenched in the colonies. One must know that the working people of the metropolitan countries have also paid a heavy price for colonial policies and colonial wars, as well as for adventures like those in Algeria or the Congo. They pay with the lives of their sons. They suffer from increased taxes, from the deprivation of acquired democratic freedoms, and from other disasters caused by the rampant activities of reactionaries and militarists in their own countries.

The great significance of the increasingly strengthened worldwide front against colonialism lies in the fact that with the collapse of colonialism in all its forms and manifestations, the barriers that imperialism has erected between peoples and between countries will collapse. The distrust that has been sown for centuries between nations, tribes, and clans will disappear more rapidly, and their fraternal unity and cooperation will grow and strengthen more rapidly. This will lay a more solid foundation for the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems.

Of course, we cannot fail to see the differences between the resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly and the declaration submitted by the Soviet government to the General Assembly for consideration. The Soviet declaration is characterized by its extreme breadth and argumentation, its clarity and thoroughness. It sharply and deeply criticizes modern colonialism and reflects the interests of the vast majority of mankind. The Soviet government's proposals are more specific. Its purpose is to fundamentally transform the relations between countries and peoples left over from the old era of imperialist domination of the world. Therefore, we believe that the Soviet proposals more fully meet the urgent needs of the times and the aspirations of the people of colonial and dependent countries.

Due to the insistence of the Soviet government, the United Nations held a separate vote on the declaration proposed by the Soviet Union. All socialist countries and most Asian and African countries voted in favor of the Soviet declaration. When voting on the various parts of the Soviet declaration, twenty-five to thirty-two countries voted in favor, and twenty-nine to thirty countries abstained. In other words, the countries representing the vast majority of the world's population voted in favor of our proposal.

This shows that the ideas of the Soviet declaration are in line with the interests of the majority of the world's inhabitants, and it is a broad political program in the struggle against colonialism.

The United Nations has adopted a resolution. However, the people of the world, especially those who have recently shaken off the shackles of colonialism or are still engaged in a heroic struggle for their own liberation, cannot and should not rely solely on the United Nations resolution. One must know that the colonialist countries abstained from voting, and they did not even support an incomplete resolution. It is quite clear that behind this behavior of the colonialist countries lies their attempt to maintain and preserve the decadent colonial system. The people of all countries should take this into account.

The bloodshed in Algeria, the Congo, and Laos, as well as the conspiracies against independent Cuba and many other countries, eloquently demonstrate that the struggle to break free from the shackles of colonialism requires even greater efforts. It would be wrong to have illusions and indulge in the idea that everything can now be easily obtained. No, a tenacious struggle must be waged. This struggle must continue until all countries and peoples achieve independence and national freedom.

The people of all countries have embarked on the road to independence and freedom. However, it will take time to erase from their consciousness all traces of the old concepts, views, and prejudices left over from the past. The old always leaves many traces: old concepts inevitably play a role now and in the future. Just looking at the tragedy of the Congo and the events surrounding the Congo is enough to understand that colonialism today is not only maintaining its position using its old methods. It is also increasingly taking advantage of the lack of unity among oppressed tribes, clans, and nations, their lack of experience in struggle, and their lack of understanding of their true interests. Life sometimes gives the people of all countries painful but necessary lessons. It teaches them to choose more correct shortcuts to achieve their goals and shows which people and parties are most capable of defending their interests. Therefore, the problem is not only to oppose the external forces that have an interest in preserving the colonial system. It is also very important to truly instill the lofty ideas contained in the resolution adopted by the United Nations into the consciousness of the people of all countries: it is necessary to explain the significance of what is happening and to expose all manifestations of colonialism everywhere, in all strata of society, and in all countries. Then colonialism will no longer be able to rely on any force, any bribery, or any bayonets to support itself.

The main task now is to strive to implement the will of the people of all countries expressed in the United Nations Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, so that the demands put forward in this declaration do not remain on paper but are embodied in practical action. It is not permissible to use various means and tricks to obstruct the implementation of the General Assembly resolution. Since the United Nations resolution says that colonialism should be ended immediately, then corresponding measures should be truly implemented immediately, rather than delaying implementation under various pretexts. The elimination of the colonial system in this or that country must not be a superficial act, nor should it become empty talk through ways that actually still retain the colonial system within it. Nor can it be allowed for colonialists to retain strongholds such as territories or leased areas.

Representatives of many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have correctly pointed out on the United Nations podium that colonialism is doing everything possible to cling to its remaining positions and influence, attempting to continue colonialist oppression and exploitation of the people of all countries in new forms, using traitors and quislings from these countries, puppets like Mobutu, political zombie Chiang Kai-shek and the like. They want to give the people of African countries, for example, only a flag and a national anthem, but in reality, they retain the former colonial system in political and economic terms. What is happening now is that certain non-Asian and African countries that have been declared independent are being bound by new chains made up of many unequal "treaties" and "agreements" that deprive them of true sovereignty.

The General Assembly's declaration does not refer to giving the people of all countries a false break from the shackles of colonialism, but a genuine break from the shackles of colonialism. Therefore, the people of all countries will fight for genuine liberation, not false liberation, for genuine freedom, not superficial freedom. As the Eastern proverb says: What the traveler needs is a real spring, not its illusion.

The Soviet government hopes that the countries that voted in favor of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in the United Nations will continue to support measures to combat colonialism in practical action. The era of colonialism is over, and the demands of the people of all countries, who hope to achieve independence, national freedom, and a secure and prosperous life for everyone, must be taken into account.

If the colonialist countries challenge the United Nations and continue to obstruct the liberation of the oppressed peoples and oppose their independence, then the people of these countries will have no choice but to resolutely fight to eliminate all obstacles in their path. In this struggle, they will not be isolated.

The Soviet government is proud that the United Nations' historic resolution on the elimination of the colonial system was adopted on the initiative of the socialist Soviet state. Not only communists, but all honest people in the world are forever irreconcilable opponents of the colonial system. The idea of freeing the people of all countries from colonial capitalist oppression is increasingly gripping the people of the world.

No matter what obstacles the colonialists create, the system of plunder and robbery established by imperialism will inevitably be shattered and thrown into the dustbin of history. The people of all countries around the world are looking forward to the arrival of this moment and are fighting to bring it about.

    赫鲁晓夫就联大关于给殖民地人民独立的宣言发表声明
    殖民主义的丧钟敲响了　应当把它埋葬
    新华社28日讯　塔斯社莫斯科27日电：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫就联合国大会关于给予殖民地国家和人民独立的宣言发表声明，全文如下：
    联合国大会经过长时间和全面的讨论之后，于1960年12月14日通过了一项历史性决议：关于给予殖民地国家和人民独立的宣言。世界上绝大多数国家的代表都赞同这个由亚非四十三个独立国家提出的决议。
    八十九个国家的代表投赞成票，九个国家代表弃权，没有一个代表敢于反对。这就是一场尖锐政治斗争的结果。不仅在联合国大会会议上展开了这场斗争，而且全世界，都围绕着苏联就这个激动着各洲亿万人的、当代最迫切和最重大的问题所提出的建议展开了这场斗争。
    大家都记得在有许多国家的卓越国家活动家参加的本届联大会议开始时所展开的激烈和尖锐的辩论。我从纽约回国后，注意地注视着就殖民地问题所进行的顽强斗争。在联合国大会内和联合国外都进行了这一斗争。
    现在，这个重要决议终于通过了，各国人民可以祝贺自己的巨大成就。
    联合国的决议，同苏联在联合国提出的宣言一样，有一个主要的结论作为基础：必须最迅速地、彻底地、普遍地消灭各种形式和各种表现的殖民主义。我们的建议，自始至终浸透着各个民族和各国人民自由、平等和友好的这一崇高的列宁主义思想，这一建议的实质在联合国决议中得到了反映。因此，苏联的宣言可以被认为是联合国决议的政治基础。当然，联合国通过的宣言包含着不同国家的观点之间某种妥协的痕迹。但是，文件的实质是表现得相当清楚的。
    正因为如此，有理由认为，联合国大会所通过的决议是那些在争取和平和各地人民的独立的斗争中采取一贯立场的各国所取得的巨大胜利。这是一贯争取使一切被压迫国家人民获得民族解放和民族复兴的社会主义各国的巨大胜利，这是反对殖民主义的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各独立国家外交政策的巨大胜利，这也是西方各爱好和平和自由的国家和力量的胜利。
    由这样大的多数通过决议这个事实本身就说明很多问题。在投票时弃权的只是殖民主义国家的代表（对多米尼加共和国独裁者的代表的弃权不能认真看待，它没有殖民地，实质上，它自己就是个殖民地。要知道，它的现任代表的本身并不表达多米尼加人民的意志）。现在特别明显地看到，各被压迫民族的伟大朋友列宁是多么正确，还在半个世纪以前，他就指出了那些同继续对亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民实行殖民主义掠夺和压迫有直接利害关系的国家和人士正在日益减少。如果我们亲爱的导师和领袖能够看到昨天还处在被欺凌和无权地位、而今天却摆脱了殖民主义枷锁并得到了发展自己独立的民族国家的可能的许多国家人民蒸蒸日上和迅速向前发展的情况，他该多么高兴啊。
    联大通过的关于给予殖民地国家和人民独立的宣言表明，在我们的时代里，反对可耻的殖民主义枷锁的统一战线是如何成长和加强了。现在，反对殖民主义的是社会主义各国人民和不久前摆脱了殖民主义压迫的各国人民，这是很自然的和可以理解的。甚至像奥地利、瑞典、丹麦、挪威、芬兰、加拿大、新西兰等这样许多资本主义国家也都赞同关于消灭殖民主义的决议。
    所有这一切都说明苏联的论断，其中也包括我们提出的宣言中的论断的正确性，这就是：殖民主义已经成为各国和各国人民的沉重负担，殖民主义的丧钟敲响了，应当把它埋葬。
    苏联人衷心地欢迎反对殖民主义斗争战线的扩大。因为要消灭殖民主义，就必须不仅在它们进行罪恶活动的地方，即在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，而且要在它的老巢，在收藏掠夺东西的地方，揭露和消灭殖民主义，即在殖民主义的巢穴——宗主国本土揭露殖民主义。
    我相信，如果对殖民主义制度命运问题公开地和公正地投票表决，不单单是在联合国大会会议厅中进行，而且在各国人民当中进行，那末殖民主义拥护者，甚至在下面这样一些国家中也不会得到他们所需要的票数，这些国家的代表在联大表决关于给予殖民地国家和人民独立的宣言时弃权。
    殖民主义政策和殖民主义剥削制度，只是给盘踞殖民地的一小撮资本主义垄断组织及其仆从带来好处和巨额利润。要知道，宗主国劳动人民对于殖民主义政策和殖民主义战争以及像在阿尔及利亚或刚果的冒险行动也付出了沉重的代价。他们付出自己儿子的生命。由于赋税增加，由于所获得的民主自由被剥夺和由于反动派和军国主义在本国猖獗活动而造成的其他灾难，使他们受尽痛苦。
    现在日益加强的全世界反对殖民主义斗争阵线的伟大意义在于，随着各种形式和各种表现的殖民主义的崩溃，帝国主义在各国人民之间和各国之间所筑起来的壁垒将倒塌。多少世纪以来在各个民族之间、各个部族之间和各个部落之间所散布的不信任将更加迅速地消失，它们兄弟般的团结和合作将更加迅速地增长和加强。这样也就为不同社会制度国家的和平共处奠定更加牢固的基础。
    当然，我们不能不看到联合国大会所通过的决议和苏联政府提交联大审理的宣言之间的区别。苏联宣言的特点是极为广泛和有论据、鲜明和彻底，它猛烈地和深刻地批评现代殖民主义，反映人类绝大多数的利益。苏联政府的建议更为明确。它的目的是，彻底改造帝国主义统治世界的旧时代所遗留下来的各国之间和各国人民之间的那种关系。因此，我们认为，苏联的建议更充分地符合时代的迫切要求以及殖民地和附属国人民的愿望。
    由于苏联政府的坚持，联合国对苏联所提出的宣言进行了单独的表决。所有社会主义国家和大多数亚非国家投票赞成苏联的宣言。在对苏联的宣言各个部分进行表决时，有二十五个到三十二个国家投票赞成，二十九个到三十个国家弃权，换句话说，占人类绝大多数人口的国家投票赞成我们的方案。
    由此可见，苏联宣言的思想符合世界大多数居民的利益，它是在反对殖民主义斗争中的广泛的政治纲领。
    联合国通过了决议。但是，世界各国人民，首先是不久前摆脱殖民主义桎梏的、或者还在为自身解放进行英勇斗争的人民，不能而且不应该单是指望联合国的决议。要知道，殖民主义国家在表决时弃权，他们甚至连不完备的决议都不支持。十分明显，在殖民主义国家这种行径的背后隐藏着它们想要保持和维护腐朽的殖民主义制度的企图。各国人民应该考虑到这点。
    阿尔及利亚、刚果、老挝的流血事件以及对独立的古巴和其他许多国家进行的阴谋雄辩地说明，争取摆脱殖民主义桎梏的斗争要求作更大的努力。幻想和沉湎于现在可以轻而易举地得到一切，那就错了。不，必须进行顽强的斗争。这个斗争要继续到各国和各国人民获得独立和民族自由为止。
    各国人民已经走上争取独立和自由的道路。但是，要从他们意识中抹掉过去所遗留下来的一切旧的概念、观点和成见的遗迹，还需要一段时间。旧东西总是留下很多痕迹：旧的概念现在和将来都不可避免地发生作用。看一看刚果的悲剧和围绕刚果所发生的事件，就足以了解，殖民主义今天不仅用它的老办法来维持自己的局面。它还日益利用被压迫的部落、部族和民族团结一致不够的情况，利用他们斗争经验不足和对自己真正利益认识不足的情况。生活有时给各国人民以痛苦的、然而是必要的教训，它教导选择更正确地达到目的的捷径，并表明哪些人士和政党最能保卫他们的利益。因此，问题不仅在于反对那些与保存殖民主义制度有利害关系的外部势力。而且非常重要的是，使联合国通过的决议中所包括的崇高思想真正地深入各国人民的意识中：必须解释所发生的事件的意义，在一切地方、在社会的各阶层中、在各个国家中揭露殖民主义的一切表现。那时殖民主义就不能再依靠任何力量、任何收买和任何刺刀来支撑了。
    现在主要任务是争取使联合国关于给予殖民地国家和人民独立的宣言中所表达的各国人民的意志付诸实现，使这个宣言中所提出的要求，不停留在纸面上，而体现在实际行动中。不容许利用各种手段和诡计阻挠联大决议的执行。既然联合国决议中说，应该立即结束殖民主义，那末就应当真正立即开始执行相应的措施，而不是在各种借口下拖延执行。必须使在这个或那个国家中的殖民主义制度的消灭，不是一种表面行动，不致通过实际上仍然在其中保留殖民主义制度的方式而成为空谈。也不能容许殖民主义者保留领地或租借地区等据点。
    亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲许多国家代表在联合国讲坛上正确地指出，殖民主义千方百计地企图固守还存在的阵地和影响，企图以新的形式继续对各国人民进行殖民主义压迫和剥削，利用这些国家人民的叛徒和卖国贼，蒙博托、政治僵尸蒋介石之流的傀儡。他们想给予例如非洲国家人民的，只是国旗和国歌，但实际在政治和经济方面保留以前的殖民主义制度。现在正在发生这样的情况，某些被宣布独立的非亚国家正在被许多使它们丧失真正主权的不平等“条约”和“协定”结成的新链条束缚起来。
    联大的宣言所指的不是使各国人民虚假的摆脱殖民主义枷锁，而是真正的摆脱殖民主义枷锁。因此各国人民争取的将是真正的解放，而不是假的解放，是真正的自由，而不是表面上的自由。正如东方的谚语所说：旅行者需要的是真正的泉水，而不是它的幻象。
    苏联政府希望在联合国中投票赞成关于给予殖民地国家和人民独立的宣言的各国将在实际行动中继续支持同殖民主义作斗争的措施。殖民主义时代过去了，不能不考虑各国人民的要求，他们希望获得独立、民族自由、人人过有保障的好日子。
    如果殖民主义国家向联合国挑战，继续阻挠被压迫人民的解放和反对他们的独立，那么这些国家的人民就只有坚决进行斗争来消除他们道路上的一切障碍。在这个斗争中，他们将不是孤立的。
    苏联政府感到自豪的是，联合国关于消灭殖民主义制度的历史性决议是根据社会主义的苏维埃国家倡议而通过的。不仅共产党人，而且世界上所有正直的人们永远都是殖民主义制度不可调和的反对者。使各国人民摆脱殖民主义资本主义压迫的思想正在越来越多地掌握全世界的人民。
    无论殖民主义者制造怎样的障碍，帝国主义建立的掠夺和强盗的制度，不可避免要被粉碎，被扔到历史的垃圾箱中。全世界各国人民都在期待这一时刻的到来，并且为争取这一时刻的到来而斗争。
