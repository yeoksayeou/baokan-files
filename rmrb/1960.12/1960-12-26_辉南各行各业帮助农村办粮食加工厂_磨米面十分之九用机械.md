    Huinan Various Sectors Help Rural Areas Establish Grain Processing Factories; 90% of Rice and Flour Milling Done by Machinery

    (Our dispatch) Jilin Province's Huinan County is actively establishing rural grain processing factories, using machinery to process staple grain. Eighty-three management areas in ten rural people's communes in the county have already built eighty-six mechanized or semi-mechanized grain processing factories. 91% of the staple grain is processed by machinery, and the output rate has increased by an average of 8%. The mechanization and semi-mechanization of grain processing saves 1,524 laborers and 1,964 draft animals every day compared to traditional methods, powerfully strengthening the front line of agricultural production.

    In the process of establishing grain processing factories and reforming grain processing tools, the people's communes in Huinan County have earnestly implemented the principle of "mainly indigenous, combining indigenous and foreign methods," adapting to local conditions and using whatever power is available. The Nanguan Management Area of Fumin People's Commune used local water resources to build a hydroelectric grain processing factory, which does not require fuel or electricity, but has high production efficiency.

    The establishment of grain processing factories by the communes has received great support from various sectors. The state-owned grain processing factory transferred fifteen technicians to guide the construction of factories in ten people's communes and train technical personnel. The commercial departments promptly allocated sixty-nine various power machines, forty-five rice milling machines, fifty crushers, forty steel mills, as well as various materials such as rice tubes and conveyor belts.

    辉南各行各业帮助农村办粮食加工厂
    磨米面十分之九用机械
    本报讯　吉林省辉南县积极办农村粮食加工厂，用机械加工口粮，全县十个农村人民公社的八十三个管理区，已经建成机械化或半机械化的粮食加工厂八十六处，机械加工的口粮达91％，出品率平均提高8％。粮谷加工实现机械化、半机械化，比土法加工每天可以节省劳动力一千五百二十四名，畜力一千九百六十四头，有力地加强了农业生产第一线。
    辉南县各人民公社在办粮谷加工厂，改革粮谷加工工具的过程中，认真贯彻了“以土为主，土洋结合”的方针，因地制宜，有什么动力就利用什么动力。抚民人民公社南关管理区利用当地的水源，建成一座水力粮谷加工厂，不用燃料也不用电，生产效率却很高。
    公社办粮谷加工厂得到各行各业很大支援。国营粮食加工厂抽调了十五名技术工人，到十个人民公社巡回指导建厂，培养技术人员。商业部门及时下拨了各种动力机六十九台，大米机四十五台，粉碎机五十台，钢磨四十台，以及米筒子、传送带等多种物资。
