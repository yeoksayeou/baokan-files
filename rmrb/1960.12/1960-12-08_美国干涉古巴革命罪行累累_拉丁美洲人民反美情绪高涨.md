    U.S. Crimes of Intervention in the Cuban Revolution Are Piling Up
    Anti-American Sentiment Among Latin American People is Rising
    Editor's Note: The American magazine *The Nation* published an article by Carleton Beals on the U.S. policy toward Cuba on November 12. The author's purpose is to advocate that the U.S. government adopt a "more enlightened policy," namely, to obstruct the national democratic movements of the Latin American people through economic "aid." However, the article also admits the evil facts of the United States' consistent interference in the Cuban revolution and acknowledges that the anger of the Latin American people towards the United States is growing. The article is excerpted and translated as follows:

    Cuban leaders have a much more thorough understanding of history than American politicians. They remember that after President Taft ordered American citizens to withdraw from Mexico in March 1913, one of Mexico's most respected presidents was assassinated (he was troubled and conspired against by North American companies), and the brutal, counter-revolutionary Huerta government was established.

    Cubans remember their own recent history. In 1934, when Grau San Martín—a moderate reformer—boldly stipulated a minimum wage of one dollar a day in Cuba and tried to reduce electricity rates from 25 cents to 17 cents per kilowatt-hour, the island was surrounded by thirty American warships; throughout his administration, two cruisers remained stationed in Havana Harbor, with their guns, unshrouded, aimed at O'Reilly Street. Cubans remember that U.S. Ambassador Sumner Welles colluded with fascist A.B.C. terrorists and Batista to overthrow Grau and install the illegitimate Mendieta government, followed by terror and bloodshed.

    They remember even more recent history: U.S. Ambassador Smith held secret talks with Army Minister Tabernilla to replace the crumbling Batista regime with a military commission. But unlike the tricks of Ambassador Wilson in Mexico and Ambassador Peurifoy in Guatemala, Smith's conspiracy came too late to deceive the Castro revolution.

    The Castro revolutionary government knows that Washington has declared an unforgivable economic war on Cuba, with the aim of overthrowing Castro at all costs. Months ago, Castro's officials obtained several posters secretly printed by U.S. Ambassador Bonsal. These posters said that this was the home of an American citizen, and then asked not the Cuban government but those who might gain power to respect the property of American citizens.

    But the recent actions taken by the United States are even more serious. It is clearly letting loose again: planes taking off from the United States are violating Cuban territory, distributing propaganda leaflets, air-dropping rebels and weapons, and destroying sugarcane fields and factories.

    What Cubans are really worried about is that the United States is plotting to use Guantánamo as a pretext for launching an invasion. Even if an attack is launched, the idea of immediate armed intervention may be wrong. A state of semi-war between the two countries would allow the United States to impose a blockade on the island, starving the Cuban people into submission. There are indications that there is a faction in Washington, mainly military personnel, who hope to implement such a blockade.

    Every time we launch a "punitive strike" against Cuba, we lose the support of the Latin American people; even "loyal" governments are wavering. We expressed our willingness to provide Peru with large loans to entice it to initiate the recent OAS conference in San José, but it is now refusing to accept the money; instead, the Peruvian Congress is considering four laws to take over the American oil industry.

    Latin America's resentment of the United States has been gradually increasing, especially after Washington orchestrated the overthrow of Arbenz in Guatemala. Today, countries are filled with anger at our policy towards Cuba, which does not need Castro to incite with propaganda.

    Recently, in August, a poll conducted by Princeton University in Cuba showed that 85% of the people support Castro and the revolution.

    Because we are waging a cold war against Castro, we are losing the battle to win over the neutral and independent emerging countries of the world.

    Unfortunately, indications are that we intend to continue on our current foolish path.

    Even if we manage to install a counter-revolutionary government, we will fail in Cuba. Such an anti-Castro regime, if it does not fall under the impact of Fidel's "street revolution," will have to maintain itself on a base of terror that is even worse than that of Batista. So would we, despite our vocal opposition to all forms of dictatorship, support a brutal right-wing dictatorship?

    On this issue, if we are truly opposed to dictatorships, then why are we only bullying Cuba? What about Trujillo? What about Franco? Why are we bullying a government that promises—for the first time in Cuban history—to make it possible for its people to live a better life?

### 美国干涉古巴革命罪行累累  拉丁美洲人民反美情绪高涨

专栏：外论摘要

    美国干涉古巴革命罪行累累
    拉丁美洲人民反美情绪高涨
    编者按　11月12日的美国《民族》周刊发表了卡尔顿·比耳斯论述美国对古巴政策的一篇文章。作者的目的，是鼓吹美国政府采取“比较明智的政策”，即通过经济“援助”作手段来阻挠拉丁美洲人民的民族民主运动。但是，在文章里也供认了美国一贯干涉古巴革命的罪恶事实，承认拉丁美洲人民对美国的愤怒正在增长。现在把文章摘译如下：
    古巴领导人对历史的了解比美国政治家们透彻得多。他们记得，塔夫脱总统在1913年3月命令美国公民撤出墨西哥后，接着墨西哥的最受人尊重的总统之一遇了刺（他是被北美公司困扰和共谋陷害的），成立了残暴的、反革命的乌埃塔政府。
    古巴人记得他们自己最近的历史。在1934年当格劳·圣马丁——一个温和的改良者——大胆地规定古巴的最低工资为每天一美元并设法把电费从每度二角五分减为一角七分时，该岛被三十艘美国军舰包围了起来；在他整个执政期间，有两艘巡洋舰一直停泊在哈瓦那港，舰上卸去炮衣的大炮瞄准着奥赖利街。古巴人记得，美国大使萨姆纳·韦尔斯同法西斯A·B·C恐怖主义者和巴蒂斯塔勾结在一起推翻格劳而安插了非法的门迪埃塔政府，随之而来的是恐怖和流血。
    他们记得更近的历史：美国大使史密斯同陆军部长塔维尼利亚举行秘密商谈，用一个军事委员会来接替摇摇欲坠的巴蒂斯塔政权。但是同驻墨西哥大使威尔逊和驻危地马拉大使普里弗伊的诡计不同，史密斯的阴谋来得太晚了，以致无法欺骗卡斯特罗革命。
    卡斯特罗革命政府知道，华盛顿对古巴宣布了不可宽恕的经济战，其目的是不惜代价地来推翻卡斯特罗。数月以前，卡斯特罗的官员们得到了由美国大使邦沙尔秘密印刷的几份招贴。这些招贴说，这是一所美国公民的住房，接着不是要求古巴政府而是要求可能得到权力的人尊重美国公民的财产。
    但是最近美国采取的行动更为严重了。显然又一次放手干了起来：从美国起飞的飞机侵犯古巴领土、散发宣传印刷品、空投叛乱分子和武器、破坏甘蔗田和工厂。
    古巴人真正担心的是，美国正在阴谋利用关塔那摩作为发动入侵的借口。即使发动进攻，关于随着立即发生武装干涉的想法，可能是错误的。两国处于半交战状态的情况将使美国可以对该岛实行封锁、使古巴人民挨饿，以致使他们屈服。有迹象表明，华盛顿有一派人，主要是军界人士，希望实行这样的封锁。
    每当我们对古巴发动“惩罚性的打击”时，我们就失掉了拉丁美洲人民的支持；甚至连“忠诚的”各国政府也动摇了。我们对秘鲁表示愿意提供大笔贷款以诱使它发起最近在圣约瑟举行的美洲国家会议，但是它现在拒绝接受这笔钱；相反，秘鲁国会正在考虑四项接管美国石油产业的法律。
    拉丁美洲对美国的恶感一直在逐步增长，特别是在华盛顿策动推翻危地马拉的阿本斯以后。今天各国对我们的对古巴的政策满怀愤怒，它不需要卡斯特罗用宣传来煽动。
    最近在8月份，普林斯顿大学在古巴进行的民意测验表明，85％的人民是支持卡斯特罗和革命的。
    由于我们对卡斯特罗发动冷战，我们在争取世界上各中立和独立的新兴国家的战役上正在吃败仗。
    很不幸，迹象表明，我们打算继续采取我们目前采取的愚蠢的道路。
    即使我们得以安插进一个反革命政府，我们在古巴也会失败。这样一个反卡斯特罗政权如果不是在菲德尔的“街头革命”的冲击下倒台，就要在一批巴蒂斯塔的基础更为糟糕的恐怖的基础上来维持自己。那么我们是不是会尽管口口声声反对各种形式的独裁政权却去支持一个残暴的右翼独裁政权呢？
    在这个问题上，如果我们真正反对独裁政权，那么我们为什么单单欺负古巴呢？特鲁希略怎样呢？佛朗哥怎样呢？我们为什么欺负一个答应——在古巴历史上还是第一次——使自己的人民有可能过比较好的生活的政府呢？
