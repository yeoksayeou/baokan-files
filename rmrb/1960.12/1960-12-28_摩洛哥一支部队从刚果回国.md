This is the first batch of Moroccan troops withdrawn from the United Nations forces in the Congo.

Morocco currently has approximately three thousand two hundred troops in the Congo.

    摩洛哥一支部队从刚果回国
    新华社拉巴特24日电　一支由九十七名官兵组成的摩洛哥部队今天从刚果回到摩洛哥的西迪斯利曼基地。
    这是摩洛哥从刚果联合国军撤回的第一批摩洛哥部队。摩洛哥政府在帝国主义及其代理人武装绑架刚果总理卢蒙巴后，曾于12月12日宣布决定撤回它在刚果的部队。摩洛哥现在在刚果的部队共约三千二百人。
