Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 18th - The Pathet Lao Fighting Units Radio broadcast on the evening of the 17th that Prince Souphanouvong, Honorary Chairman of the Lao "Committee for Peace, Neutrality, National Harmony and Unified State" and Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, issued a statement in Sam Neua, calling on the Lao people nationwide, especially the military and civilians of the capital Vientiane, to unite closely, struggle unremittingly and resolutely, and form a powerful force around the Souvanna Phouma government to promote the implementation of the policy of peace, neutrality, national harmony and a unified state, to defend the motherland, religion, the King and the Constitution, and to realize the independence, democracy and prosperity of the country. Souphanouvong called on governments of all countries that love peace, freedom and cherish friendship between nations, and peace-loving people of the world to support the Lao people and the Lao Royal Government, who are resolutely struggling for sovereignty and justice.

The statement called on the Lao people to be vigilant and smash all enemy conspiracies of discord, retaliation and suppression. The statement said that the traitorous group, ignoring the people's and the government's desire for peace and being unwilling to see Lao people killing each other, launched an extremely barbarous large-scale attack on the capital Vientiane, causing serious losses to the people of the capital. These losses "are caused by the U.S. imperialists, the reactionary forces of Thailand and South Vietnam, and their loyal running dogs, the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous group, who are interfering in and invading Laos. They must bear full responsibility to our motherland, to history, and to world opinion."

The statement said that during the traitorous group's attack on Vientiane, the people of the capital, the government army, the Pathet Lao Fighting Units and the patriotic youth armed forces bravely and resolutely dealt heavy blows to the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous group and aggressors and interventionists such as U.S. imperialism, Thai and South Vietnamese reactionary forces, thereby receiving the admiration of the Lao people and world opinion. Throughout the country, the government army has victoriously struck the traitorous group in many places. Although the traitorous group can temporarily control the capital, the heroic struggle of the government army and the people's forces in Vientiane and in various districts and provinces will strengthen the power of the legitimate Phouma government.

Prince Souphanouvong, in the name of the Honorary Chairman of the "Committee for Peace, Neutrality, National Harmony and Unified State" and Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, suggested that the people nationwide regard December 13th as "Hatred Day", hating the enemies of the people, hating the criminals who committed heinous crimes in the capital Vientiane, and hating U.S. imperialism and other reactionary forces that interfere in and invade Laos, as well as their capable running dogs, the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous group.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 18th - According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao Fighting Units Radio on the 17th: The Lao People's Armed Forces, executing the order of the Supreme Command of the Lao Pathet Lao Fighting Units Armed Forces and responding to the call of the Royal Government on December 16th, are attacking Nong Het County in Xieng Khouang Province. According to initial reports, twenty enemy soldiers were killed and many were wounded.

In Khammouane Province, the People's Armed Forces are also attacking and encircling the enemy's stronghold of Lang Khang (formerly translated as Nam Khan).

    新华社河内18日电　寮国战斗部队电台17日晚上广播，老挝“争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会”名誉主席、老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王在桑怒发表声明，呼吁老挝全国人民、特别是首都万象军民紧密团结，不懈地、坚决地斗争，在梭发那·富马政府的周围结成一个强大的力量，以促进和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家政策的实施，保卫祖国、宗教、国王和宪法；实现国家的独立、民主和繁荣。苏发努冯呼吁爱好和平、自由和珍视各国之间的友谊的各国政府和世界爱好和平人民，支持为了主权和正义而正在坚决斗争的老挝人民和老挝王国政府。
    声明号召老挝人民提高警惕，粉碎敌人离间、报复、镇压等一切阴谋。声明说，叛国集团无视人民和政府的和平和不忍目睹老挝人自相残杀的愿望，竟然对首都万象进行了极其野蛮的大规模的进攻，使首都人民遭受严重损失。这些损失“是干涉和侵略老挝的美帝国主义、泰国和南越反动势力以及它们的忠实走狗富米—文翁叛国集团所造成的。它们必须对我们祖国、对历史、对世界舆论担负全部责任。”
    声明说，在叛国集团进攻万象期间，首都人民、政府军、寮国战斗部队和爱国青年武装力量英勇地、坚决地给予富米—文翁叛国集团以及美帝国主义、泰国和南越反动势力等侵略者和干涉者沉重打击，从而受到老挝人民和世界舆论的钦佩。在全国，政府军在许多地方胜利地打击了叛国集团。尽管叛国集团能够暂时控制首都，但是，政府军和人民力量在万象和各区、各省的英勇斗争取得胜利，就会增强富马合法政府的力量。
    苏发努冯亲王以“争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会”名誉主席和老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席的名义，建议全国人民把12月13日作为“仇恨日”，仇恨人民的敌人，仇恨在首都万象制造滔天罪行的罪犯，仇恨干涉和侵略老挝的美帝国主义和其它反动势力以及它们得力的走狗富米—文翁叛国集团。
