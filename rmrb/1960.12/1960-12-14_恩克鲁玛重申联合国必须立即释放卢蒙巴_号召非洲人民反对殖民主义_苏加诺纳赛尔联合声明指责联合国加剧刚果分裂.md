Xinhua News Agency, Accra, December 11th: Ghanaian President Nkrumah, at a rally in Kumasi, a major city in Ghana, on December 10th, reiterated his demand that the United Nations immediately and unconditionally release Patrice Lumumba, the legitimate Prime Minister of the Congo, restore Lumumba's central government, and allow the constitutional parliament to exercise its functions.

Nkrumah arrived in Kumasi on December 9th and is scheduled to conduct a six-day inspection of the Ashanti and Brong-Ahafo regions in central Ghana.

At the rally, he stated, "The recent developments in the Congo are a sad commentary on the cunning and ruthless attempts by colonialists and imperialists to strengthen their foothold on the African continent." He said, "This is a matter of deep concern to all of us, and serious developments, fraught with danger for the whole of Africa, are occurring every day."

Nkrumah emphasized, "African independent states should now more than ever unite in their efforts to eradicate the remnants of imperialism on this continent and to block the forces of neo-colonialism."

Nkrumah said that if UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld "ignores, as usual," the suggestions he made in his letter to Hammarskjöld on December 7th, "tragic consequences will confront Hammarskjöld."

Nkrumah's letter to Hammarskjöld on December 7th was released by Ghanaian Foreign Minister Adjei at a press conference held here on December 9th. In the letter, Nkrumah wrote, "We now see the legitimate Prime Minister of the Congo, Lumumba, imprisoned, and his country's parliament surrounded by armed personnel undoubtedly supported by foreign powers."

He said he was "extremely disturbed" by the attitude and policy of the United Nations, which was opposing the government that invited it to the Congo to restore law and order.

He also said that he was now surprised to see the Western world openly and loudly applauding the fact that a group of soldiers had banned the activities of the elected Congolese parliament.

The Ghanaian President concluded in his letter that unless the legitimate Prime Minister of the Congo and other members of his government were immediately released and parliamentary democracy restored, a state of chaos would emerge in the Congo, for which the United Nations could not shirk its responsibility.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 12th: President Sukarno and President Nasser, in a joint statement issued here tonight, accused the United Nations of intensifying activities aimed at splitting the Congo. The statement said that the current situation in the Congo indicates that neo-colonialist forces have resurfaced in the Congo.

This joint statement was issued after Indonesia and the United Arab Republic consulted through diplomatic channels on the developments in the Congo.

The joint statement pointed out that the United Nations' intervention in the Congo has failed to achieve the unification of the Congo under the leadership of the central government but has instead intensified the division and conflict in the Congo. The statement believes that, in fact, the United Nations has never genuinely tried to restore the central government led by Prime Minister Lumumba and the constitutionally elected legislative body, the parliament.

The statement said that from the beginning, it was clear that Belgium, as the former colonial power, was not sincerely transferring all power to the new national government and was creating a near-chaotic situation in the Congo's administration and economy.

The joint statement also called upon Asian and African countries to demand that the United Nations immediately improve the situation in the Congo so that the legitimate central government led by Prime Minister Lumumba could freely exercise its functions without any threats or interference.

    号召非洲人民反对殖民主义
    苏加诺纳赛尔联合声明指责联合国加剧刚果分裂
    新华社阿克拉11日电　加纳总统恩克鲁玛10日在加纳大城市库马西的一次集会上，重申他要求联合国立即无条件地释放刚果合法总理卢蒙巴，恢复卢蒙巴的中央政府和让合乎宪法的议会行使职权。
    恩克鲁玛是在9日到达库马西的，他预定要对加纳中部的亚山蒂和布隆加哈福地区作六天的视察。
    他在这个集会上说，“最近刚果事态的发展，对于殖民主义者和帝国主义者为了加强他们在非洲大陆的据点而进行的狡猾、无情的企图是一个可悲的评论。”他说，“这是我们全体深感不安的一件事，每天都在发生着对整个非洲充满了危险的严重的发展。”
    恩克鲁玛强调说，“非洲独立国家现在比以前任何时候都更加应该团结一致地进行努力，以便在这个大陆上肃清帝国主义的残余，并且阻挡新殖民主义的势力。”
    恩克鲁玛说，如果联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德“同往常一样无视”他在12月7日写给哈马舍尔德的信中所提的建议的话，“悲惨的后果将要在哈马舍尔德面前出现”。
    恩克鲁玛7日给哈马舍尔德的信，曾由加纳外交部长阿杰伊9日在这里举行的记者招待会上公布。恩克鲁玛在这封信中写道，“我们现在看到刚果合法总理卢蒙巴被囚禁，他的国家的议会遭到无疑是由外国势力支持的武装人员的包围。”
    他说，他对于联合国竟然反对那个邀请它前往刚果恢复法律和秩序的政府的态度和政策，“极感不安”。
    他又说，看到一帮军人禁止经过选举产生的刚果议会进行活动一事竟然得到西方世界公开的大声欢呼，我现在是感到惊讶的。
    加纳总统在信中最后说，除非立即释放刚果的合法总理和他的政府的其他成员，恢复议会民主，否则刚果将会出现混乱的状态，而对此联合国不能推卸它的责任。
    新华社雅加达12日电　苏加诺总统和纳赛尔总统在今晚在这里发表的联合声明中指责联合国加剧分裂刚果的活动。声明说，刚果目前的局势表明，新殖民主义势力已经在刚果重新抬头。
    这项联合声明是在印度尼西亚和阿联通过外交途径就刚果的发展进行磋商以后发表的。
    联合声明指出，联合国对刚果的干涉未能实现在中央政府领导下的刚果的统一，而是加剧了刚果的分裂和冲突。声明认为，事实上，联合国从来没有真正设法恢复卢蒙巴总理领导下的中央政府和根据宪法选出来的立法机构——议会。
    声明说，从一开始起，事情就很清楚，作为前殖民国家的比利时并不真心把一切权力移交给新的民族政府，而在刚果的行政和经济方面制造近乎混乱的局面。
    这项联合声明还吁请亚非国家要求联合国立即改善刚果的局势，以便使卢蒙巴总理领导的合法中央政府能够自由行使职权而不受到任何威胁和干涉。
