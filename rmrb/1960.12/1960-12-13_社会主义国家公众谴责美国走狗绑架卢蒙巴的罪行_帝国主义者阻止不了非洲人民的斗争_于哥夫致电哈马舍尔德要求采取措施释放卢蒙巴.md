Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: Mass organizations and prominent figures from the Soviet Union, Mongolia, Poland, and Albania have recently issued statements or sent telegrams to the United Nations General Assembly, strongly protesting the rebel group led by Mobutu for illegally kidnapping Prime Minister Lumumba of the Republic of the Congo and others with the support of the "United Nations Force" manipulated by American imperialism, and resolutely demanding their release.

    The Soviet Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, in a statement issued on the 9th, demanded in the name of all Soviet people the release of the kidnapped Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba, Congolese government ministers, and members of parliament, the disarmament of the Mobutu gang, and the cessation of their criminal activities. The statement said that United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld and his American masters should be held responsible for these crimes.

    The Mongolian Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, in a recent statement, condemned the "United Nations Force" in the Congo for participating in the shameful act of the Mobutu rebel group kidnapping Prime Minister Lumumba. The statement said that no matter what conspiracies the imperialist colonialists and their lackeys employ, they cannot stop the powerful movement of the African people, including the struggle of the Congolese people, to win national independence and oppose colonialism. The Congolese people, fighting for justice, will surely triumph.

    Thousands of university students and youth representatives in Warsaw held a mass rally at the University of Warsaw on the 10th to protest imperialist intervention in the Congo. The conference adopted a resolution protesting the illegal deprivation of the freedom of Congolese legitimate government Prime Minister Lumumba and others, and the brutal mistreatment of them. Warsaw youth demanded the immediate release of those arrested and guarantees that they would be able to exercise power in accordance with the will of the Congolese people.

    The Presidium of the Polish Committee for the Defense of Peace, Chairman Kulczyński, economist Professor Lange, and writer Kruczkowski and others sent a telegram to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 10th, requesting immediate measures to release Prime Minister Lumumba and others, disarm the Mobutu bandits, restore the rule of law and the normal functions of the parliament, and enable the heroic Congolese people to enjoy freedom.

    The Council of the Albanian Association of Legal Workers held a meeting in Tirana on the 11th and adopted a statement on the kidnapping of Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba, condemning the tyrannical acts committed by the Mobutu clique on the orders of their American and Belgian masters. The statement firmly protested and demanded the immediate release of Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba, the Speaker of Parliament, and all patriots who have been arrested, the disarmament of the Mobutu bandits and traitors who serve the Belgian colonialists and imperialists, and that the "United Nations Force" not be used to suppress the Congolese people's liberation movement.

    Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, December 11th: Bulgarian newspapers reported on the 10th that the Chairman of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers, Anton Yugov, sent a telegram to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld saying: The Bulgarian government and all the Bulgarian people cannot remain indifferent to the events taking place in the Congo today. The People's Republic of Bulgaria most resolutely advocates the immediate taking of measures to release Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba and the other kidnapped ministers and parliamentarians, convene the legally elected National Assembly of the Congo, and stop the aggressors and their agents.

    The telegram pointed out that every honest person in the world understands that the actions of the "United Nations Force" headquarters in the Congo are entirely in the service of the interests and conspiracies of imperialism, harmful to the Congolese people, and threaten this part of Africa and world peace.

    The telegram said that the Bulgarian government fully supports the proposals put forward in the Soviet government's statement on the situation in the Congo and calls for the immediate implementation of these proposals.
