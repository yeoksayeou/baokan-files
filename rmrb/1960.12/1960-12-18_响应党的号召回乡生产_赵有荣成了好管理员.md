Xinhua News Agency, December 17th: Zhao Yourong, an 18-year-old junior high school student and member of the Communist Youth League from the Gaomiaotun Production Team of the Yanqing People's Commune in Yanqing County, Beijing suburbs, has become a canteen administrator and accountant praised by the commune members after more than two months of training.

Zhao Yourong was originally in the first year of junior high school in the middle school class of a nearby village elementary school. This summer, he responded to the Party's call to return to his hometown to participate in agricultural labor. After returning to his hometown, he was quickly elected as the captain of the youth shock brigade because of his good work. Throughout the entire autumn harvest, Zhao Yourong led his team members to do whatever the Party told them to do, and went wherever there were difficulties. Seeing how good he was, everyone unanimously elected him to be the canteen administrator.

Zhao Yourong was young and had no experience in running a canteen. The Party branch assigned Secretary Zhang Zhong and a Party branch committee member who worked as a cook in the canteen to help him specifically. He encountered difficulties at the very beginning of his work. With so many people eating in the canteen, how much grain should be put in the pot for each meal to avoid waste? This made him very embarrassed. He didn't know how to use an abacus, and the accounts were often calculated incorrectly in the first few days. At this time, the Party branch asked the production team's accountant and the old administrator who used to be in the canteen to help him calculate and teach him how to calculate. Zhao Yourong was very moved and studied very hard.

Zhao Yourong paid close attention to the opinions of the commune members and cooks. The commune members hoped to eat vegetable-filled dumplings, and the cooks also said that dumplings were delicious, labor-saving, and did not waste grain. Zhao Yourong asked the Party branch for instructions and adopted everyone's opinions. Someone said that his method of selling food was not very good, and he changed it on the spot.

After more than two months of training, Zhao Yourong has begun to be able to carry out management work relatively skillfully. The canteen not only has clear accounts, but also implements the spirit of diligence and thrift. The vegetables stored in the canteen can be eaten until April next year, and more than 150 jars of pickles have also been made. The number of pigs in the canteen has also increased from three in the past to ten.

    响应党的号召回乡生产
    赵有荣成了好管理员
    据新华社17日讯　北京郊区延庆县延庆人民公社高庙屯生产队十八岁的初中学生、共青团员赵有荣，经过两个多月的锻炼，已经成为一个受到社员称赞的食堂管理员兼会计。
    赵有荣原来在附近村庄小学的中学班里读初中一年级，今年暑假，他响应党的号召回到家乡参加农业劳动，回乡后因为劳动好，很快就被选为青年突击队队长。在整个秋收过程中，赵有荣领导队员们做到了党叫干什么就干什么，那里有困难就到那里去。大伙看他好，就一致选他担任食堂管理员。
    赵有荣年轻没有办食堂的经验，党支部指定书记张忠和一个在食堂当炊事员的支部委员具体帮助他。工作一开始就碰上了困难，食堂里那么多人吃饭，每顿饭究竟要多少粮食下锅才不浪费？使他很作难。他不会使用算盘，开头几天账目常常算不对。这时党支部就让生产队的会计和原来在食堂的老管理员帮他算，教他算。赵有荣很受感动，学习很努力。
    赵有荣很注意听取社员和炊事人员的意见。社员们希望吃菜馅团子，炊事员也说团子好吃、省工、不费粮，赵有荣请示了党支部，采纳了大家的意见。有人说他卖饭方法不大好，他当场就改。
    经过两个多月的锻炼，赵有荣已经开始能够比较熟练地进行管理工作，食堂里不仅账目清楚，还贯彻了勤俭精神。食堂储存的蔬菜可以吃到明年4月份，还腌制了一百五十多缸咸菜，食堂的猪也由过去的三头增加到十头。
