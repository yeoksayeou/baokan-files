Reasonable Resolution of the Overseas Chinese Dual Nationality Issue

The Chinese government and the Indonesian government have reached an agreement on the implementation measures for the treaty on the issue of dual nationality. These implementation measures were signed on December 15th in Jakarta by the chief representatives of both sides of the China-Indonesia Joint Committee, and the instruments of ratification were exchanged by both sides in Jakarta on the 21st. It is scheduled to be announced and take effect today (24th) simultaneously. These implementation measures were formulated by the Chinese government and the Indonesian government in the spirit of friendly consultation, based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, for the implementation of the treaty on the issue of dual nationality. The announcement and entry into force of the implementation measures for the dual nationality treaty enable the implementation of the provisions of the Treaty between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia on the Question of Dual Nationality of April 22, 1955, and the Exchange of Letters between the Premiers of the two countries of June 3, 1955, and open up a path for the comprehensive resolution of the Overseas Chinese issue existing between China and Indonesia. This is a victory for the Chinese government and the Indonesian government in comprehensively resolving the Overseas Chinese issue, and a major achievement in resolving international issues through peaceful consultation. This shows that as long as both sides have the intention of friendly cooperation and the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation, any difficult issue between countries can be reasonably resolved through peaceful consultation. Therefore, the Chinese people warmly welcome the announcement and entry into force of the implementation measures for the dual nationality treaty, and fully support the implementation of the treaty on the issue of dual nationality.

The issue of dual nationality of Overseas Chinese is a problem left over by history. The Chinese government has always believed that it is unreasonable for Overseas Chinese to have dual nationality, because this is not only detrimental to the personal interests of Overseas Chinese, but also may be used by forces hostile to the friendship between our country and relevant countries to carry out instigation and sabotage activities. The Treaty between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia on the Question of Dual Nationality stipulates that every person with dual nationality can voluntarily choose the nationality of the People's Republic of China or the nationality of the Republic of Indonesia, and the implementation measures for the dual nationality treaty between the two governments determine that all necessary measures should be taken and various facilities should be provided for the implementation of the aforementioned treaty. This enables every person with dual nationality to choose their nationality according to their own wishes, so that the issue of dual nationality of Overseas Chinese can be properly and reasonably resolved.

We have always taken into account that the Overseas Chinese with dual nationality in Indonesia have lived and worked hard in Indonesia for generations, and have contributed to the local economic and cultural construction; and have formed close ties with the local people, and have integrated with the local people in economic and cultural life. It is entirely understandable that many of them are willing to choose Indonesian nationality to participate in the public life of the Indonesian people on an equal footing. The Chinese government and people understand and approve of their wishes, and hope that they can choose Indonesian nationality based on the principle of voluntariness. Once they acquire Indonesian nationality, they should of course be loyal to Indonesia, and at the same time, they should of course enjoy the rights of citizens of this country, without any discrimination. Therefore, Overseas Chinese joining the nationality of the country of residence is in the interests of the countries concerned and in their own interests.

Of course, due to various different circumstances, there may still be some Overseas Chinese with dual nationality who retain the nationality of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese government and people also welcome this. We hope that the legitimate rights and interests of these Overseas Chinese can be respected so that they can continue to reside in Indonesia. The Chinese government will also continue to encourage Overseas Chinese residing in Indonesia to respect the laws of the country of residence and local social customs, not to participate in the political activities of the country of residence, and to live in friendship with the local people and continue to make positive contributions to Indonesia's economic development. People who voluntarily choose Indonesian nationality or retain the nationality of the People's Republic of China should, from now on, work together in the spirit of friendship and unity to promote the friendly and good-neighborly relations between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia.

The Chinese government's policy on resolving the Overseas Chinese issue is entirely consistent with China's peaceful foreign policy. China sincerely hopes to live in friendship with Southeast Asian countries, and advocates resolving all issues between them on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. China's peaceful foreign policy is firm and unshakable, and can stand the test of time. The Chinese government's unremitting and sincere efforts to promote peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems are also obvious to all. China has signed treaties of friendship and non-aggression or treaties of peace and friendship with Yemen, Burma, Nepal, Afghanistan, Guinea, and Cambodia, respectively. We have consistently maintained friendly and cooperative relations with many Asian countries. The reasonable resolution of the dual nationality issue between the Chinese government and the Indonesian government is another new and powerful proof.

China and Indonesia are two friendly countries, and there is a profound friendship between the two peoples. There is no fundamental conflict of interest between China and Indonesia, but there are thousands of reasons for needing friendly cooperation. Our two countries not only share the common experience of imperialist and colonialist aggression and oppression; today we also face a common enemy and face the same tasks. China's territory of Taiwan and Indonesia's territory of West Irian are still occupied by imperialism; it is entirely necessary for the people of our two countries to strengthen unity, support each other, and help each other in the struggle against imperialist aggression and interference, in the struggle to safeguard their sovereignty and territorial integrity, and in the cause of economic development. The Chinese government has always believed that consolidating and developing the friendship between our two countries is in line with the wishes and fundamental interests of the two peoples. Although some unpleasant things have happened between the two countries on the Overseas Chinese issue in the past year or so, this is only a temporary problem and a minor difficulty after all. Our two governments have been seeking a reasonable solution to this problem. As Indonesian President Sukarno said: "We have some difficulties with China, namely difficulties on the Overseas Chinese issue, but these are not major difficulties. With the goodwill of the two countries, these difficulties can be resolved. In any case, these small difficulties will not change our position and desire to maintain the closest relationship with China."

Now, due to the announcement and entry into force of the implementation measures for the treaty on the dual nationality issue between the Chinese government and the Indonesian government and the implementation of the treaty, there has been new and important progress in the resolution of the Overseas Chinese issue existing between our two countries. The treaty between the two countries on the dual nationality issue, the exchange of letters between the Premiers of the two countries on the implementation measures of this treaty, and the implementation measures of the treaty are all fair and reasonable. In the future, as long as both sides continue to adopt a positive and cooperative attitude, create a good atmosphere for the implementation of the treaty, provide convenient conditions, and strictly abide by the provisions of the treaty, the exchange of letters, and the implementation measures, we believe that this treaty can be implemented smoothly, and the Overseas Chinese issue can be resolved comprehensively and reasonably. Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai once emphasized: "The friendly resolution of this temporary problem between our two countries will be conducive to the further development of the friendship between our two peoples and the relations between our two countries. This is beneficial to both the Chinese people and the Indonesian people, and it is also beneficial to the unity of the people of Asian and African countries." We sincerely hope that the friendly and cooperative relations of the Chinese and Indonesian countries will continue to develop under the guidance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Conference spirit.

### 华侨双重国籍问题的合理解决

    华侨双重国籍问题的合理解决
    我国政府和印度尼西亚政府已就双重国籍问题条约的实施办法达成协议。这项实施办法已于本月15日在雅加达由中国和印度尼西亚联合委员会的双方首席代表签字，21日双方在雅加达互换了批准书，并定于今天（24日）同时公布生效。这项实施办法，是我国政府和印度尼西亚政府本着友好协商的精神，根据平等互利和互不干涉内政的原则，为实施关于双重国籍问题的条约而制定的。双重国籍条约实施办法的公布生效，就使1955年4月22日中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国关于双重国籍问题的条约和1955年6月3日两国总理换文的规定得以付诸实施，并且为全面解决存在于中国和印度尼西亚之间的华侨问题，开辟了道路。这是我国政府和印度尼西亚政府全面解决华侨问题的一个胜利，也是通过和平协商解决国际问题的重大成就。这表明只要彼此都具有友好合作的意愿、本着互谅互让的精神，国家和国家之间的任何繁难问题，都是可以通过和平协商的途径求得合理解决的。因此，我国人民对双重国籍问题条约的实施办法公布生效表示热烈的欢迎，并且全力支持关于双重国籍问题的条约的实施。
    华侨的双重国籍问题，是历史遗留下来的问题，中国政府一向认为华侨具有双重国籍是不合理的，因为这不仅不利于华侨的切身利益，而且有可能被那些敌视我国同有关国家友谊的势力利用来进行挑拨和破坏活动。中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国关于双重国籍问题的条约规定每一个具有双重国籍的人，都可以自愿选择中华人民共和国国籍或印度尼西亚共和国国籍，而两国政府关于双重国籍问题条约的实施办法，又确定为实施上述条约采取一切必要的措施和提供各种便利条件。这就使每一个具有双重国籍的人能够根据自己的意愿选择他们的国籍，从而使华侨的双重国籍问题获得妥善和合理的解决。
    我们历来考虑到，在印度尼西亚的具有双重国籍的华侨，都是在印度尼西亚世代相传，辛勤劳动，对当地的经济和文化建设做出过贡献；并且和当地人民结成了血肉相连的亲密关系，在经济和文化生活方面已经同当地人民融合在一起。他们当中许多人愿意选择印度尼西亚国籍，以平等的身分参加印度尼西亚人民的公共生活，这是完全可以理解的。我国政府和人民谅解和赞同他们的愿望，希望他们能够根据自愿的原则，选择印度尼西亚国籍。他们一旦取得印度尼西亚国籍，就当然应当效忠于印度尼西亚，同时也当然享受这个国家的公民权利，而不受任何歧视。因此，华侨加入侨居国的国籍，是既符合于有关国家的利益，也符合于他们本身的利益的。
    当然，由于各种不同的情况，可能还有一部分具有双重国籍的华侨，保留中华人民共和国国籍，我国政府和人民也表示欢迎。我们希望这些华侨的正当权利与利益能够得到尊重，使他们能在印度尼西亚继续居留。我国政府也将继续勉励居住在印度尼西亚的华侨尊重侨居国政府的法律和当地的社会风俗习惯，不参加侨居国的政治活动，并且，同当地人民友好相处，对印度尼西亚的经济发展继续做出积极的贡献。自愿选择印度尼西亚国籍、或保留中华人民共和国国籍的人，今后都要本着友好团结的精神，为促进中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国的友好睦邻关系而共同努力。
    我国政府关于解决华侨问题的方针是同我国的和平外交政策完全一致的。我国诚心诚意地希望同东南亚各国友好相处，主张在和平共处五项原则的基础上解决彼此间的一切问题。中国的和平外交政策是坚定不移的，是经得起时间的考验的。中国政府为不同社会制度的国家和平共处坚持不懈地进行真诚的努力，更是有目共睹的。中国同也门、缅甸、尼泊尔、阿富汗、几内亚、柬埔寨，分别签订了友好和互不侵犯条约或者和平友好条约。我们同很多亚洲国家，一贯保持着友好合作的关系。中国政府和印度尼西亚政府关于双重国籍问题的合理解决，更是一个新的有力的证明。
    中国和印度尼西亚是两个友好的国家，两国人民间存在着深厚的友谊。我国和印度尼西亚之间并不存在根本利害的冲突，却有着千条万条的理由需要友好合作。我们两国不仅有着帝国主义、殖民主义侵略和压迫的共同遭遇；今天还面临着共同的敌人，面对着同样的任务。中国的领土台湾、印度尼西亚的领土西伊里安，仍然被帝国主义霸占；我们两国人民完全有必要在反对帝国主义侵略和干涉的斗争中、在维护自己主权和领土完整的斗争中，在发展经济的建设事业中，加强团结，互相支持，互相帮助。中国政府一向认为，巩固和发展我们两国之间的友谊，是符合两国人民的愿望和根本利益的。尽管最近一年多来，两国在华侨问题上，发生了一些不愉快的事情。但这毕竟只是暂时性的问题，是小的困难。我们两国政府一直在谋求这个问题的合理解决。正如印度尼西亚苏加诺总统所说：“我们同中国有一些困难，即在华侨问题上的困难，但是这些不是重大的困难。依靠两国的善意，这些困难是能够解决的。无论如何，这些小困难丝毫不会改变我们要同中国保持最密切的关系的立场和愿望。”
    现在，由于中国政府和印度尼西亚政府关于双重国籍问题的条约的实施办法的公布生效和条约付诸实施，存在于我们两国之间的华侨问题的解决有了新的重要的进展。两国关于双重国籍问题的条约、两国总理关于这个条约的实施办法的换文和条约的实施办法都是公平合理的。今后，只要双方继续采取积极合作的态度，为条约的实施创造良好的气氛，提供便利的条件，并且严格遵守条约、换文和实施办法的规定，我们相信这个条约是能够顺利实施，华侨问题是能够获得全面合理解决的。我国周恩来总理曾经强调指出：“我们两国之间这个暂时性的问题的友好解决，将有利于我们两国人民友好和国家关系的进一步发展，这是对中国人民和印度尼西亚人民都有利的事情，也是对亚非各国人民的团结有利的事情。”我们衷心地希望中国和印度尼西亚两国的友好合作关系在和平共处五项原则和万隆会议精神的指导下，继续得到发展。
