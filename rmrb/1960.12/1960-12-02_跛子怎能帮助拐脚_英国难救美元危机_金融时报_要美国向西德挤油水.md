Xinhua News Agency, December 1st – An article published in the British *Financial Times* on November 28th bluntly told the United States that “Britain is in a position that makes it impossible to do much about the U.S. balance of payments problem.”

The *Financial Times* encouraged the United States to extract money from West Germany, Britain's competitor. The newspaper said, "Currently, and for many years, West Germany has been the main source of imbalance in world trade, and the outflow of (U.S.) reserves to West Germany is one of the fundamental causes of the (U.S.) deficit. It would be a great example of a cripple helping a lame man for the United States to ask Britain, which consistently has a trade deficit, to spend more foreign exchange on Western defense."

But the *Financial Times* was unwilling to openly offend West Germany. It wrote, "It is also completely unrealistic for Britain to come out and openly support Mr. Anderson diplomatically in his dispute with Bonn. Such a statement by Mr. Macmillan or Mr. Lloyd would have absolutely no positive effect on Dr. Adenauer. It would only unnecessarily risk breaking the fragile political understanding that has recently been established between Britain and West Germany at the highest level."

The *Financial Times* lamented, "In any case, Britain is deeply involved in the dollar's troubles. The main danger is that, failing an agreement with West Germany, the Americans may insist on taking unilateral action to solve the problem. Eisenhower's recent economic measures are only a small step in this direction. It would be a more serious matter (for Britain) if they took big steps in overseas aid, investment, traveler spending, or exports.”

    跛子怎能帮助拐脚  英国难救美元危机
    “金融时报”要美国向西德挤油水
    新华社1日讯　英国《金融时报》11月28日发表的一篇文章，直截了当地告诉美国说，“英国所处的地位使它不能在（缓和）美国支付平衡问题上做很多事。”
    《金融时报》怂恿美国从英国的竞争对手西德身上榨出钱来。报纸说，“目前以及许多年来，西德是使世界贸易失去平衡的主要根源，流往西德的（美国外汇）储备是造成（美国）逆差的根本原因之一。美国要求对外贸易一贯有赤字的英国为西方防务出更多的外汇，那将成为跛子帮助跛子的绝好事例”。
    但是《金融时报》又不愿公开得罪西德。它写道，“要英国出来在安德逊先生同波恩的争执中公开在外交上支持安德逊，这也是完全不现实的。麦克米伦先生或者劳埃德先生发表这样一个声明，对阿登纳博士绝对不会有积极的效果。却只会不必要地使英国和西德最近在最高级水平上建立起来的脆弱的政治谅解冒破裂的危险”。
    《金融时报》叹息说，“不管怎样英国是大大地卷在美元的麻烦中了。主要的危险是，由于同西德达不成协议，美国人可能坚持采取单方面的行动来解决这个问题。艾森豪威尔最近的一些经济措施只是在这方面走了小小的一步。如果在海外援助、投资、旅行者支出或者出口方面大踏一步，那（对英国）就会是一件更严重的事情。”
