    Construction of the Vinylon Factory
    A large-scale vinylon chemical fiber factory is under construction in the northern region of Korea. Once completed, it will have an annual output of 20,000 tons of chemical fiber raw materials, equivalent to planting 200,000 chongbo (1 chongbo is approximately equal to 15 mu in China) of cotton.
    The northern climate of Korea is not suitable for growing cotton, and the arable land area of only 1.8 million chongbo does not allow for squeezing out grain to grow more cotton. According to the Secretary-General of the Korean State Planning Commission: currently, the cotton planting area in northern Korea is 50,000 chongbo, and the unit yield per chongbo is about 500 kilograms (seed cotton), which is far from meeting the needs of the textile industry. Therefore, it is necessary to concentrate efforts on solving the problem of fiber raw materials. The Party and the government require that the factory complete the construction of equipment with an annual output of 10,000 tons before "May Day" next year, and complete the construction of equipment with an annual output of 20,000 tons by the end of next year. In this way, it can provide raw materials for the annual production of 150 million square meters of textiles. This number is equal to the total output of textiles in the northern region of Korea last year. The completion of this factory will not only fundamentally change the current situation of insufficient raw materials for the textile industry, but also require the expansion and construction of more textile factories to produce new products.
    Vinylon has a strength three to four times higher than cotton, and its raw material is calcium carbide, which is produced in large quantities by the Hungnam Chemical Factory in Korea. The raw material for calcium carbide is limestone, which is found everywhere in Korea. The largest consumption of the chemical industry is electricity, and Korea's electric power industry has developed rapidly after the war. These are all favorable conditions for the development of the organic chemical industry.
    From the successful research of vinylon to factory design, equipment manufacturing, and construction, the Korean people have solved it with their own wisdom. Dr. Lee Sung-ki, the inventor of vinylon, used to work in research in Japan. After the liberation of Korea, he returned to South Korea, hoping to realize his ideals. He submitted a factory construction plan to the South Korean authorities, but the Syngman Rhee puppet regime ignored him. He brought his hopes to North Korea. With the strong support of the Korean Workers' Party and the government, his hopes finally became a reality.
    The vinylon factory under construction covers an area of 508,000 square meters and has 38 factory buildings. Together with the Hungnam Chemical Factory, which has already been put into production, the dye factory and polyvinyl chloride factory under construction, and the synthetic rubber factory to be built, it will form the world's largest first-class chemical complex.
    In order to promote the construction of the vinylon factory and lay the foundation for chemicalization, Premier Kim Il-sung led a group of state planning personnel and scientific and technological experts to the construction site to inspect, study and solve a number of major problems that could not be solved locally. He believes that the construction of the vinylon factory is the first high ground in socialist construction to be occupied in the first year of the Seven-Year Plan. The completion of this factory is equivalent to building a strong fiber raw material base, and at the same time can solve a large number of light industrial raw material problems, laying the foundation for the comprehensive realization of chemicalization in Korea. In order to support the construction of the vinylon factory, factories and enterprises in northern Korea have placed the task of producing equipment and materials needed by the vinylon factory in the first place, and launched competitions to strive for early delivery. The Seven-Year Plan stipulates the task of producing 300 million square meters of textiles annually in the next two or three years, which will be realized due to the completion of this factory.

### 维尼龙工厂的建设

    维尼龙工厂的建设
    朝鲜北部地区正在建设一个规模宏大的维尼龙化学纤维工厂，建成后年产量为二万吨化学纤维原料，等于种二十万町步（一町步约等于中国十五亩）棉花。
    朝鲜北部气候不适宜于种植棉花，加之耕地面积只有一百八十万町步，也不容许挤掉粮食去多种棉花。据朝鲜国家计划委员会事务长（即秘书长）谈：现在朝鲜北部棉花种植面积为五万町步，每町步单位产量约五百公斤（籽棉），远不能满足纺织工业的需要。因此，必须集中力量解决纤维原料问题。党和政府要求这个工厂在明年“五一”前建成年产一万吨的设备，明年年底建成年产两万吨的设备。这样，就可以提供年产一亿五千万平方米纺织品的原料。这个数字等于去年朝鲜北部地区纺织品的全部产量。这个工厂的建成，不仅将从根本上改变现有纺织工业原料不足的状况，而且需要扩建和新建更多的纺织工厂来生产新的产品。
    维尼龙的强度比棉花高三至四倍，它的原料是电石，朝鲜的本宫化学厂就大量生产电石。电石的原料是石灰石，在朝鲜到处都有。化学工业最大的消耗是电力，而朝鲜的电力工业战后发展得很快。这些都是发展有机化学工业的有利条件。
    从维尼龙的研究成功，到工厂设计、设备制造、建筑施工，都是朝鲜人民用自己的智慧解决的。维尼龙发明者李升基博士，原在日本搞研究工作，朝鲜解放后，回到南朝鲜，希望实现自己的理想。他向南朝鲜当局提出了建厂方案，可是，李承晚傀儡政权没有理睬他。他把自己的希望带到了北朝鲜。在朝鲜劳动党和政府的大力支持下，他的希望终于变成了现实。
    正在建设中的维尼龙工厂占地五十万八千平方米，有三十八个厂房，它和已经投入生产的本宫化学厂，正在建设的染料工厂、聚氯乙烯工厂，将要建设的合成橡胶厂等一起，将组成世界上最大的第一流化学联合厂。
    为了促进维尼龙工厂的建设和打下化学化的基础，金日成首相曾带了一批国家计划人员和科学技术专家到工地视察过，研究并解决了当地所不能解决的若干重大问题。他认为维尼龙工厂的建设，是在七年计划第一年里准备占领的社会主义建设中的第一个高地。建成了这个工厂，等于建成了强大的纤维原料基地，同时可以解决大量的轻工业原料问题，为朝鲜全面实现化学化奠定基础。为了支援维尼龙工厂的建设，朝鲜北部各工厂企业都把生产维尼龙工厂所需设备和材料的任务放在首要的地位，并且发动竞赛，力争提前交货。七年计划规定在今后两三年内每年生产三亿平方米纺织品的任务，将因这个工厂的建成而得到实现。
