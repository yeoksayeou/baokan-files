    Chairman Brezhnev said:
    The Soviet people are sincerely happy for the achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong.
    Chairman Liu Shaoqi said:
    We Chinese people will always stand together with you and with the Soviet people. We Chinese people firmly believe that the great Soviet people will always stand with us.
    Xinhua News Agency, Leningrad, December 3rd: Liu Shaoqi, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, President of the People's Republic of China, and head of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation, visited the famous Kirov Factory in Leningrad this morning at 11:00 AM and was warmly welcomed by all the workers of the factory.

    Also visiting the Kirov Factory with Chairman Liu Shaoqi today were Li Jingquan, Lu Dingyi, Yang Shangkun, Liu Ningyi, and Liu Xiao, members of our country's Party and Government Delegation.
    At 11:15 AM, when Chairman Liu Shaoqi arrived at the factory, he was warmly greeted by Isayev, the factory director, Kalinin, the factory Party Secretary, and some veteran Communist Party members in the factory. Then, accompanied by the factory director, Chairman Liu Shaoqi visited two mechanical assembly workshops of the Kirov Factory. The thousands of workers in these two workshops welcomed the arrival of our country's Party and Government Delegation with enthusiastic cheers and applause. During the visit, Chairman Liu Shaoqi had cordial conversations with the Soviet workers and observed their operating techniques.
    At 12:00 noon, a mass meeting of workers was held in the tenth workshop of the Kirov Factory. In the middle of the venue were large portraits of Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Khrushchev, and Brezhnev, as well as large banners in both Chinese and Russian characters: "Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the great people of the Soviet Union and China!"
    Kalinin, the Party Secretary of the Kirov Factory, delivered a welcome speech at the mass meeting, saying that all the staff and workers of the Kirov Factory welcomed the distinguished Chinese guests with great joy. We are sincerely happy for the achievements made by the Chinese people in the past eleven years under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. He hoped that the Chinese Delegation would convey the respect of the Soviet people and Soviet workers to the Chinese people and Chinese workers.
    Old worker Miroshnikov, who participated in the October Revolution, said in his speech that in the days of the October Revolution, the workers of the Putilov Factory (the predecessor of the Kirov Factory) deeply believed when attacking the Winter Palace that the banner raised by the great Lenin would fly all over the world. And now, that time has come. Now, advancing with us are our most loyal friends and brothers—the great Chinese people and all the people of the socialist camp countries. No force in the world can reverse the wheels of history and undermine the unity of the socialist camp.
    Also speaking at the meeting were Lebedev, the captain of the Communist Labor Team, and Zhuravleva, the representative of the young workers.
    Brezhnev, Member of the Presidium, Central Committee of the CPSU and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, also spoke at the meeting. He said that Leningrad is the pride of the Soviet people. Forty-three years ago, the guns of the "Aurora" here announced the beginning of the socialist era. Now, the working people of Leningrad are adding new glory to their city with their heroic labor.
    Brezhnev said that the Soviet people, who are building communism, are excited to see that the great Chinese people and all the people of the socialist camp countries are advancing side by side with the Soviet people today. The Soviet people are sincerely happy for the achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong.
    Brezhnev concluded by saying that Soviet-Chinese friendship is unbreakable. The friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China, and the friendship between the people of socialist countries, are built on the principles of Marxism-Leninism. This friendship is a reliable guarantee for the victory of peace, democracy, socialism, and communism.
    Chairman Liu Shaoqi also spoke at the meeting. When he stepped onto the podium, warm and prolonged applause rang out in the venue. The workers shouted:
    "Salute to the great and hardworking Chinese people!" "Long live the glorious Chinese Communist Party!"
    Chairman Liu Shaoqi said that your factory is a factory with a glorious revolutionary tradition. Lenin had done a lot of work and delivered many famous speeches in your factory. Many outstanding revolutionary cadres and many cadres for building socialism and communism have emerged from your factory.
    Chairman Liu Shaoqi said that our country also has factories, mines, rural areas, and troops like your factory that maintain excellent revolutionary traditions and work styles. The work of a factory, a rural area, and a troop is well done, which is not only of national significance but also of world significance. We hope that comrades will inherit Lenin's excellent revolutionary traditions and work styles, maintain them forever, and further promote them.
    Chairman Liu Shaoqi said that your factory is also a world-renowned factory. The various new machines you produce are strengthening the power of the socialist camp every day, every hour, and every minute. Your factory has supplied China with many excellent equipment and trained technical cadres for China. On behalf of the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese government, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you, to all the Soviet people, the Soviet Communist Party, and the Soviet government. We Chinese people will always stand together with you and with the Soviet people. We Chinese people firmly believe that the great Soviet people will always stand with us. In our common struggle, we Chinese people are the most reliable and closest brothers and friends of the Soviet people.
    Chairman Liu Shaoqi finally shouted: "Long live the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union!" "Long live the great Soviet people!" "Long live the great Soviet Communist Party!" "Long live the Central Committee of the CPSU headed by Comrade Khrushchev!"
    At this time, the audience also shouted, "Long live Soviet-Chinese friendship!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long live Comrade Mao Zedong!" The slogans rose one after another. Amidst warm applause, Isayev, the director of the Kirov Factory, presented a gift to Chairman Liu Shaoqi.
