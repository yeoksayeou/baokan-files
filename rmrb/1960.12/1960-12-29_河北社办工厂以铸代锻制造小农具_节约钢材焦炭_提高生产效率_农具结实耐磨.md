Xinhua News Agency, 28th. Several hundred people's commune-run iron factories in Hebei Province have adopted the method of using casting instead of forging, producing more than five million small farm tools, daily necessities such as kitchen knives, scissors, and spatulas, as well as certain machine parts. Adopting the method of casting instead of forging has saved the country a great deal of high-quality steel and coke.

In the past, the production of small farm tools and small hardware items involved heating high-quality steel to a red glow and forging it hammer blow by hammer blow. Now, casting instead of forging involves melting pig iron, mixing it with some scrap wrought iron, and casting it into blanks of various products. These blanks are then subjected to slow annealing (闷火) to enhance their toughness. Some products, such as cutting tools, are also quenched after annealing to increase hardness and strength. In this way, the products are more wear-resistant and less brittle. The iron factory of the Simencun People's Commune in Jiahe County, Hebei Province, was the first to apply annealing and quenching techniques to treat pig iron castings, enabling pig iron castings to replace products forged from steel. Iron factories in Tangshan, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, and other places further developed and improved this experience during its promotion. Recently, workers at the Zhuoxian Laishui Commune Farm Implement Repair Factory absorbed experiences from various locations and integrated this new process into a complete system. They use bituminous coal to melt iron to save coke; use mud molds instead of sand molds for casting to improve work efficiency and eliminate sand holes; and use reverberatory furnaces for annealing and salt-alkali quenching to increase the product yield rate and quality.

Small farm tools and small hardware products produced using the "casting instead of forging" method have sufficient tensile strength and hardness, are relatively wear-resistant, and are well-received by the masses. White iron scissors produced by several iron factories in Tianjin can cut through five layers of tinplate at once; some commune members of Chengezhuang Commune in Tangshan said after using cast hoes: "They are strong, wear-resistant, save money, and are easy to use."

Casting efficiency is also higher than forging. The Handai Commune Repair Factory in Xinle County uses casting to produce hoes, increasing efficiency by nine times compared to forging. The Tie-Mu Factory of the Jing'an Commune in Changli County produced nail hammers. In the past, three people at one furnace could only forge five hammers a day. After using casting instead of forging, the daily output is 240.

### 河北社办工厂以铸代锻制造小农具  节约钢材焦炭　提高生产效率　农具结实耐磨

    河北社办工厂以铸代锻制造小农具
    节约钢材焦炭　提高生产效率　农具结实耐磨
    新华社28日讯　河北省有几百个人民公社办的铁工厂，采用以铸代锻办法，共生产了五百多万件小农具和菜刀、剪刀、锅铲等日常生活用具，以及某些机器零件。采用以铸代锻办法，为国家节省了很多好钢材和焦炭。
    过去制造小农具和小五金用品，都是把好钢铁烧红以后一锤一锤锻打成的。现在以铸代锻，就是用熔化了的生铁掺上一些废杂熟铁，铸成各种产品的毛坯，经过闷火，加强它的韧性；有些产品如刃具等在闷火以后还要再淬火，增加硬度和强度。这样，产品就比较耐磨而不太脆。河北省交河县寺门村公社铁工厂首先把闷火和淬火技术，用来处理生铁铸件，使生铁铸件能够代替用钢锻打的产品。唐山、天津、石家庄等地铁工厂在推广这项经验时，又有发展和提高。最近涿县涞水公社农具修配厂职工，吸收了各地经验，使这套新工艺配套成龙。他们用白煤化铁，以节省焦炭；用泥模代替砂模浇铸，以提高工效和消除砂眼；用反射炉闷火、用盐碱淬火，以提高产品的成品率和质量。
    采用“以铸代锻”办法生产的小农具和小五金产品，有足够的抗拉强度和足够的硬度，也比较耐磨，群众乐于使用。天津市有几个铁工厂生产的白铁剪子，一次能剪断五层马口铁；唐山市陈各庄公社有的社员用了铸造的镐头以后说：“结实耐磨、省钱好使。”
    铸造效率也比锻打高。新乐县邯邰公社修配厂用铸造办法生产镐头，效率比锻打提高九倍。昌黎县靖安公社铁木工厂生产奶头锤，过去三个人一盘炉一天才打五个，以铸代锻以后，日产二百四十个。
