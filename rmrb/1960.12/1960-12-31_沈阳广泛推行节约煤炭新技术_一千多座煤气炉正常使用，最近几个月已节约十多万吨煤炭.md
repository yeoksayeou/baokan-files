Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang Electric. Shenyang City is widely promoting technological innovation achievements in saving coal. The city is vigorously promoting coal gasification, popularizing heating with hot air (native-style central heating), and adopting new technologies in boilers, generally saving 20% to 30% of coal.

The gas furnaces born in Shenyang's coal gasification movement in April and May this year currently have more than a thousand units that are consistently in normal use. Some of these gas furnaces, after further reforms, can now burn low-quality pulverized coal. These gas furnaces are used in industrial production, as well as for boiling water, cooking, and heating. In recent months, they have saved the country over ten thousand tons of coal.

Leaders at all levels in Shenyang City attach great importance to continuously summarizing and improving coal gasification technology in order to consolidate and improve the achievements of the coal gasification movement. When using gas initially, due to lack of experience, many gas furnaces experienced slagging, insufficient gasification, insufficient intensity, and inability to burn low-quality coal. The city and district coal gasification leading departments promptly summarized the experience of those gas furnaces with good coal combustion, and concentrated on applying the experience to one furnace for testing, exploring experience for the city's gas furnaces to pass the technical barrier. For example, after the rubber factory's gas furnace was built, slagging and insufficient gas temperature occurred. Later, with the assistance of the city and district coal gasification headquarters, they learned some advanced experiences from the Northeast Pharmaceutical Factory, Transformer Factory, and Plastics Factory gas furnaces, and made a series of improvements from the furnace structure, equipment parts to the coal gas combustion method, adapting to the need to burn low-quality pulverized coal. In this way, this gas furnace became a "model furnace" for the city. More than one hundred "model furnaces" appeared in the city. Subsequently, the city comprehensively integrated the advantages of this batch of "model furnaces" and designed two sets of standardized drawings, which were vigorously promoted after successful key tests. Relevant departments in the city and districts, and various units, also adopted methods such as intensive training and furnace-side operation to train tens of thousands of operators. In this way, from improving the construction and use technology of gas furnaces and training technical forces, the consolidation and improvement of gas furnaces were guaranteed in all aspects.

    沈阳广泛推行节约煤炭新技术
    一千多座煤气炉正常使用，最近几个月已节约十多万吨煤炭
    据新华社沈阳电　沈阳市广泛推行节约用煤的技术革新成果。全市大搞煤气化，推广取暖热风化（土暖气）和在锅炉上采用新技术，一般地都能节省煤炭20％到30％。
    沈阳市在今年4、5月份开展煤气化运动中诞生的煤气炉，目前有一千多座坚持正常使用，其中有些煤气炉，经过进一步改革，已能燃烧劣质粉煤。这些煤气炉有用于工业生产的，也有用于烧水、做饭、取暖的，最近几个月已为国家节省了十余万吨煤。
    沈阳市各级领导十分重视不断地总结和改进烧煤气的技术，来巩固和提高煤气化运动的成果。开始运用煤气的时候，由于缺乏经验，不少煤气炉出现结渣、气化、强度不够和不能燃劣质煤等现象。市、区煤气化领导部门，就及时总结那些燃煤情况良好的煤气炉的经验，集中在一个炉子上运用试验，为全市煤气炉过技术关摸索经验。如橡胶厂的煤气炉建成后，曾发生结渣、煤气温度不够现象。后来，在市、区煤气化指挥部的协助下，学习了东北制药总厂、变压器厂、塑料厂煤气炉的一些先进经验，从炉体结构，设备配件到煤气燃烧方法，进行了一系列的改进，适应了烧劣质粉煤的需要。这样，这座煤气炉就成为全市的“样板炉”。全市共出现了一百多座“样板炉”。接着，全市又综合了这批“样板炉”的优点，设计出两套定型图纸，经过重点试验成功后就大力推广。市、区有关部门和各单位，还采取了集训和炉旁操作等方法，培养训练了上万名操作工人。这样，就从提高煤气炉的建筑、使用技术和培养技术力量等各方面，保证了煤气炉的巩固和提高。
