Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 8th: The Vietnamese newspaper "Nhan Dan" published an editorial on December 7th regarding the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties, stating that this declaration is the excellent result of democratic discussion and exchange of opinions among eighty-one fraternal parties. Based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism, it analyzes the international situation in the three years since the 1957 Moscow meeting, elucidates the main issues of the current world, and points out the path forward for communist parties and working people of all countries to strive for new victories.

The editorial, entitled "The Victory and Solidarity Banner of the International Communist Movement," reviewed the international situation and the major changes that have taken place in the international communist and workers' movement since the 1957 Moscow meeting. It stated that all these changes clearly prove what the Declaration of the Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties stated: "Our era, the main content of which is the transition from capitalism to socialism begun with the Great October Socialist Revolution, is the era of struggle between two opposing social systems, the era of Socialist revolutions, national liberation revolutions, the collapse of imperialism and the liquidation of the colonial system, the era of the growing of more and more peoples taking the path of socialism, of the triumph of socialism and communism on a world-wide scale."

When discussing the great importance of the struggle of the people of all countries for peace and peaceful coexistence, and to prevent warmongering imperialism from launching a world war, the editorial said, "Due to the changes in the balance of power on the international stage, which are clearly in favor of socialism, peace and democracy, and national independence, new possibilities have emerged, and that is the possibility of preventing a world war. This possibility is increasing day by day with the growth of the socialist camp and the revolutionary movements of all countries and the peace-loving forces of the world. The current urgent task of communist and workers' parties of all countries is to continue to explain to the people of the world, to make people fully aware of the importance of the possibility of preventing a world war, and to fully believe in the reality of this possibility; we must strive to unite all forces, including bourgeois figures who do not want war, and resolutely fight to smash all war conspiracies of imperialism, and to safeguard and consolidate peace."

The editorial said, "At the same time, the new declaration also emphasizes that the aggressive and warmongering nature of imperialism has not changed. As long as imperialism still exists, there is soil for the outbreak of war. At present, the main aggressive and war forces in the world are U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism is the stronghold of world reactionary forces, the international gendarme, and the most ferocious enemy of the people of all countries. They are driving warmongering imperialism to engage in an arms race, consolidate military aggression blocs, establish military bases, revive West German and Japanese militarism, and ignite the flames of war in Europe and Asia. The people of the world are facing an extremely serious new world war crisis. Therefore, in order to defend and consolidate peace, the people of all countries must always be vigilant, must continuously strengthen unity, and must direct the spearhead of struggle at U.S. imperialism. The struggle to defend and consolidate peace is obviously a class struggle against aggressive and warmongering imperialism headed by U.S. imperialism, and the victory of this struggle mainly depends on the united struggle of the peace-loving masses of people all over the world."

When discussing the issue of peaceful coexistence between the two social systems, the editorial said, "The new declaration clearly points out the extremely important significance of the struggle to realize peaceful coexistence between countries of the socialist system and the capitalist system; on the other hand, it also emphasizes that this struggle must be combined with vigorously developing the revolutionary movement in countries of the capitalist system." The editorial said, "The struggle to realize peaceful coexistence between countries of the two systems and the struggle to develop the revolutionary movement in countries of the capitalist system are two inseparable aspects of the current world people's struggle. Peaceful coexistence is a form of class struggle between socialism and capitalism. Imperialism will never voluntarily coexist peacefully with socialist countries; on the contrary, they will do everything possible to interfere in the internal affairs of socialist countries, carry out subversive conspiracies, and provoke wars of aggression." The editorial emphasized that to achieve peaceful coexistence, "it is necessary to strengthen the strength of the socialist camp, it is necessary to vigorously strengthen the necessary struggles in the political, economic, and ideological fields between socialism and capitalism, and it is necessary to vigorously develop the revolutionary movement in countries of the capitalist system, so that imperialism will become increasingly weak, thereby forcing the imperialists to coexist peacefully with socialist countries. At the same time, the more actively we carry out the struggle to realize peaceful coexistence between countries belonging to the two systems, the more we will be able to create favorable conditions, rapidly enhance the strength of the socialist camp, accelerate the decline and collapse of imperialism, and promote the struggle movement of the people of all countries for national independence, democracy, and socialism."

The editorial said that the national liberation issue occupies an important position in the new declaration. The declaration points out that the current international situation is very conducive to the national liberation movement. In order to seize victory, "the people of colonies and dependencies and nationalist countries should vigorously build and develop their own revolutionary forces, and should flexibly use various different forms of revolutionary struggle, peaceful and non-peaceful, suitable to the specific conditions of each country." The editorial said, "The Marxist-Leninist parties of these countries should hold firmly and raise high the banner of national democracy, and should vigorously build and strengthen the united front based on the worker-peasant alliance, including the national bourgeoisie, and should carry the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution to the end, realize the independence of each country in accordance with the democratic national system, and create conditions for the country to embark on the path of non-capitalist development." The editorial also said that the very important position of the peasants in the national liberation movement and the policy of both uniting with and struggling against the national bourgeoisie are clearly pointed out in the new declaration. At the same time, the new declaration also points out that the people of the world must continue to support and help the national liberation movements and liberation wars of Asian, African, and Latin American countries. "These correct arguments of the new declaration will illuminate the path of the revolutionary struggle of the colonial countries, dependencies, and nationalist countries aimed at realizing and completing the cause of national liberation."

The editorial said that the declaration of the meeting put forward the main direction for the revolutionary struggle movement in the capitalist countries. "The working class and people of these countries must direct the spearhead of struggle against the monopoly capitalist groups, must be good at combining economic struggle and political struggle, must gradually realize united action between various communist parties and social democratic parties and realize the unity of the workers' movement through struggle, and at the same time, must vigorously establish a broad people's front based on the worker-peasant alliance." The editorial emphasized that regarding the issue of transition to socialism, "the communist parties and workers' parties must clearly recognize that the exploiting classes will never voluntarily withdraw from the stage of history, therefore, the parties must grasp and prepare for two possibilities of transition, namely peaceful transition and non-peaceful transition."

The editorial emphatically pointed out the importance of striving to strengthen the solidarity and unity in the international communist movement on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. The editorial said that this solidarity and unity is one of the main factors in bringing together all workers, democratic, and progressive forces, and is the guarantee for the world communist and workers' movement to achieve new victories in the great struggle for the bright future of mankind.

The editorial said, "The declaration of the meeting clearly points out that in order to strengthen the solidarity and unity between the communist parties and workers' parties of all countries, it is necessary to continue to wage a resolute struggle against modern revisionism, especially the revisionism of Yugoslavia, because revisionism is still the main danger in the current international communist movement. At the same time, it is necessary to continue to struggle against dogmatism and sectarianism."

The editorial emphasized that in order to strengthen solidarity and unity in the international communist movement, it is also necessary to strengthen solidarity and unity between socialist countries, as well as between the communist parties and workers' parties in power in these countries. The Soviet Union is the most powerful country in the socialist camp. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the most experienced vanguard in the international communist movement. At the same time, in the socialist camp, the Soviet Union and China are the two largest countries; in the international communist movement, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of China are the two largest parties and bear the most important responsibilities. Therefore, it is necessary to pay special attention to strengthening the solidarity and unity between the Soviet Union and China, and between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of China. Doing so is completely in line with the fundamental interests of the entire socialist camp and the entire international communist movement, and completely in line with the urgent aspirations of the working class and other progressive forces around the world. The editorial said, "This new declaration, unanimously adopted by the meeting of representatives of eighty-one fraternal parties, is a powerful proof of the unbreakable solidarity and unity between the communist parties and workers' parties of all countries and between the countries of the socialist camp, and at the same time, it is a solid foundation for further strengthening this solidarity and unity. It is a fatal blow to the warmongering imperialist bloc and the modern revisionist bloc, and to their vicious conspiracies to undermine the socialist camp and the international communist movement."

    国际共产主义运动的胜利和团结的旗帜
    越南《人民报》1960年12月7日社论摘要
    新华社河内8日电　越南《人民报》7日就各国共产党和工人党代表会议声明发表社论说，这一声明是八十一个兄弟党民主讨论和交换意见的美好结果，它在马克思列宁主义原理的基础上，分析了自1957年莫斯科会议以后三年来的国际形势，阐明了当前世界的各个主要问题，给全世界各国共产党和劳动人民指出了争取新的胜利的前进道路。
    这篇以《国际共产主义运动的胜利和团结的旗帜》为题的社论回顾了自1957年莫斯科会议以来的国际形势以及国际共产主义和工人运动中所发生的重大变化，它说，所有这些变化都清楚地证明了各国共产党和工人党会议声明中所说的：“以伟大的十月社会主义革命所开始的从资本主义向社会主义的过渡为主要内容的我们的时代，是两个对立的社会体系斗争的时代，是社会主义革命和民族解放革命的时代，是帝国主义崩溃、殖民主义体系消灭的时代，是越来越多的人民走上社会主义道路、社会主义和共产主义在全世界范围内胜利的时代。”
    社论在谈到各国人民为争取和平和和平共处，为防止好战的帝国主义发动世界大战而进行的斗争的巨大重要性时说，“由于国际舞台上的力量对比的变化明显地有利于社会主义、和平民主、民族独立，新的可能性已经出现，这就是防止世界战争的可能性。这种可能性正在随着社会主义阵营及各国革命运动和全世界爱好和平力量的壮大而日益增长。各国共产党和工人党当前的迫切任务是必须继续向世界人民进行解释，使人们充分地认识到防止世界大战的可能的重要性，并且充分相信这个可能的现实性；必须努力团结一切力量，包括不愿意发生战争的资产阶级人士，为粉碎帝国主义的一切战争阴谋，为维护和巩固和平而坚决奋斗。”
    社论说，“同时，新的声明也强调了帝国主义的侵略和好战本质仍然没有改变，只要帝国主义仍然存在，则有发生战争的土壤。目前，世界上主要的侵略和战争势力是美帝国主义，美帝国主义是世界反动力量的堡垒，是国际宪兵，是各国人民的最凶恶的敌人。它们正在带动好战的帝国主义进行军备竞赛，巩固军事侵略集团，建立军事基地，复活西德和日本军国主义，在欧洲和亚洲燃起战争的火焰。世界人民正面临着一次极其严重的新的世界大战的危机。因此，为了保卫和巩固和平，各国人民必须时刻提高警惕，必须不断加强团结，把斗争的矛头指向美帝国主义。保卫和巩固和平的斗争，显然是反对以美帝国主义为首的侵略和好战的帝国主义的阶级斗争，而这一斗争的取得胜利，主要决定于全世界爱好和平的人民群众的团结奋斗。”
    社论在谈到两种社会体系之间的和平共处问题时说，“新的声明一方面清楚地指出了为实现社会主义体系和资本主义体系各国的和平共处而斗争的极其重大的意义；另方面也强调指出，必须结合这种斗争，大力发展资本主义体系各国的革命运动。”社论说，“实现两个体系各国之间的和平共处和发展资本主义体系各国的革命运动的斗争，是当前世界人民的斗争事业不可分割的两个方面。和平共处是社会主义和资本主义之间的阶级斗争的一种形式。帝国主义永远不会自愿地同社会主义各国和平共处；相反地，它们千方百计干涉社会主义各国的内政，实行颠复阴谋和挑起侵略战争。”社论强调指出，要实现和平共处，“必须加强社会主义阵营的力量，必须大力加强社会主义和资本主义之间在政治、经济和思想领域中的必要斗争，必须大力发展资本主义体系各国的革命运动，使帝国主义日益衰弱，由此迫使帝国主义者要与社会主义各国和平共处。同时，越积极进行为实现属于两个体系的各国之间的和平共处的斗争，就越能够创造有利的条件，迅速地增强社会主义阵营的力量，加速帝国主义的衰落和崩溃过程，促进各国人民为民族独立、民主和社会主义的斗争运动。”
    社论说民族解放问题在新的声明中占有重要的地位。声明指明目前国际形势非常有利于民族解放运动。为了夺取胜利，“殖民地和附属国以及民族主义各国的人民应该大力建设和发展自己的革命力量，应该灵活地运用各种不同的、和平和非和平的、适合于每个国家的具体情况的革命斗争形式。”社论说，“这些国家的马克思列宁主义政党应该紧握和高举民族、民主旗帜，应该大力建设和加强包括有民族资产阶级在内的、以工农联盟为基础的统一战线，应该把反帝和反封建的革命进行到底，按照民主民族的制度实现各国的独立，为国家走上非资本主义的发展道路创造条件。”社论又说，农民在民族解放运动中的非常重要地位和对民族资产阶级的既联合又斗争的政策在新的声明中都有明确指出。同时新的声明还指出，世界人民必须继续支持和帮助亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国的民族解放运动和解放战争。“新的声明的这些正确论点，将照亮各殖民地国家、附属国以及各民族主义国家旨在实现和完成民族解放事业的革命斗争的道路。”
    社论说，会议声明为各资本主义国家的革命斗争运动提出了主要的方向。“这些国家的工人阶级和人民必须把斗争的矛头针对垄断资本集团，必须善于把经济斗争和政治斗争结合起来，必须通过斗争以逐步实现各个共产党与社会民主党之间的统一行动和实现工人运动的统一，同时必须大力建立以工农联盟为基础的广泛的人民阵线。”社论着重指出，关于向社会主义过渡问题，“各共产党和工人党必须认识清楚，剥削阶级从来是不会自愿退出历史舞台的，因此，各党必须掌握和准备过渡的两种可能性，即和平的过渡和非和平的过渡。”
    社论强调指出了在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的基础上努力加强国际共产主义运动中的团结一致的重要性。社论说，这种团结一致是集合所有的工人、民主和进步力量的主要因素之一，是世界共产主义和工人运动在为人类光辉未来的伟大斗争中取得新的胜利的保证。
    社论说，“会议声明明确地指出，要加强各国共产党和工人党之间的团结一致，必须继续向现代修正主义、特别是南斯拉夫的修正主义作坚决的斗争，因为修正主义仍然是当前国际共产主义运动中的主要危险。同时，必须继续向教条主义和宗派主义作斗争。”
    社论着重指出，为了在国际共产主义运动中加强团结一致，还必须加强社会主义各国之间，以及在这些国家执政的共产党和工人党之间的团结一致。苏联是社会主义阵营中最强大的国家。苏联共产党是国际共产主义运动中最有经验的先锋队。同时，在社会主义阵营中，苏联和中国是两个最大的国家；在国际共产主义运动中，苏联共产党和中国共产党是两个最大的和负有最重大责任的党。因此，必须特别重视加强苏联与中国之间、苏联共产党与中国共产党之间的团结一致。这样做是完全符合于整个社会主义阵营和整个国际共产主义运动的根本利益，完全符合于全世界工人阶级和其他进步力量的迫切愿望的。社论说，“这次为八十一个兄弟党代表会议所一致通过的新的声明，是各国共产党和工人党之间、社会主义阵营各国之间牢不可破的团结一致的有力的证明，同时，也是为进一步加强这种团结一致的牢固基础。它是对好战的帝国主义集团和现代修正主义集团，对它们妄图破坏社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的恶毒阴谋的一个致命的打击。”
