    Soviet Cultural Briefs
    Seventeen well-known cultural workers of the Russian Federation recently published a joint appeal in the "Soviet Culture Newspaper," calling on all musical workers of the Russian Federation to better serve rural laborers. The appeal calls on composers to create new artistic works with distinctive styles that reflect the present era and the people engaged in heroic labor, to create musical works for rural amateur art groups to perform, and suggests that conductors, teachers, and students of music schools help establish new choirs and orchestras in rural areas. It also suggests that professional musical workers hold more various concerts, musical theatre performances, music lectures, and symposiums in rural areas.
    The appeal was signed by Sveshnikov, Shostakovich, Surkov, Isakovsky, and others.
