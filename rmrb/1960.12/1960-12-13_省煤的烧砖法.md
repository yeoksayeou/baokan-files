    Coal-Saving Brick Burning Method

    (Our report) The Social Welfare Production Factory in the Donggang District of Lanzhou City has successfully tested a coal-saving brick burning method.

    This brick burning method involves mixing boiler cinder and yellow earth to make "cinder bricks," and then laying them and ordinary brick blanks in layers in a pre-dug circular pit according to a certain ratio.

    Because there is unburned coal in the cinder that can burn, less fuel is used. "Cinder bricks" can also be calcined into hard bricks, which can be used to build low walls and pigsties.

    This experience has been widely promoted in brick-burning units in Lanzhou. According to calculations, if all the cinder in the city is utilized, it can save more than 200,000 tons of coal per year compared to ordinary brick-burning methods.

    After testing and evaluation, the quality of bricks burned using this method is better than bricks burned in ordinary earthen kilns, and the cost is about 50% lower than earthen kilns. The brick burning time is also about 15 days shorter than ordinary earthen kilns, and it can also save some land used for brick burning.

    省煤的烧砖法
    本报讯  兰州市东岗区社会福利生产厂试验成功一种能节省煤的烧砖方法。
    这种烧砖方法，是用锅炉煤渣和黄土混合制成“炉渣砖”，把它们和普通的砖坯按比例一层层铺在事先挖好的圆坑里。
    因为炉渣里有尚未烧尽的煤能够燃烧，就少用燃料。“炉渣砖”也能炼结成坚硬的砖块，可以砌矮墙，修猪圈。
    这一经验已经在兰州市烧砖单位普遍推广。据计算，如果把全市的炉渣都利用起来，一年可以比一般的烧砖方法节约煤二十万吨以上。
    经过试验、鉴定，用这种方法烧制的砖，质量比一般土窑烧制的砖好，成本比土窑低50％左右；砖的烧成时间，也比一般土窑缩短十五天左右；还能节约一部分烧砖用地。
