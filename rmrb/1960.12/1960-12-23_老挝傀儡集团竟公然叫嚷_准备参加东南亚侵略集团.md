Xinhua News Agency, 22nd. According to Western news agencies reporting from Vientiane, the traitorous Phoumi-Boun Oum clique, the U.S. imperialist stooges in Laos, recently cobbled together a puppet "government" and, on the 21st, blatantly disregarded the provisions of the Geneva Accords on Laos, clamoring that it would join the U.S.-controlled Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) military aggression bloc when "necessary."

This was announced yesterday by Bouavan Norasing, the propaganda minister of the puppet "government," who stated that the puppet government "will not hesitate to join SEATO if it is necessary to defend the country."

He also revealed that the puppet "government" is preparing to establish so-called "civil defense forces" in the northern provinces to carry out fascist terror rule.

An Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the same day showed that this clamoring by the Lao puppet clique is clearly related to its American master's long-planned aggression plans. In mentioning the above remarks of the puppet "government," the news agency, on the one hand, had to admit that this was a violation of the Geneva Accords, but at the same time said, "There is an exception: if the security of Laos is threatened, not all restrictions on Laos are binding."

    老挝傀儡集团竟公然叫嚷
    准备参加东南亚侵略集团
    新华社22日讯　据西方通讯社自万象报道，美帝国主义在老挝的走狗富米—文翁叛国集团最近拼凑的傀儡“政府”在21日公然不顾关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的规定，叫嚷它在“必要”时将参加美国控制的东南亚条约组织军事侵略集团。
    这是傀儡“政府”的宣传大臣布文·诺拉辛在昨天宣布的，他表示，傀儡政府“将毫不犹豫地参加东南亚条约组织，如果这对于保卫国家是必要的话”。
    他还透露，傀儡“政府”准备在北方各省建立所谓“民防部队”来进行法西斯恐怖统治。
    合众国际社同一天从东京发出的一条消息表明，老挝傀儡集团的这个叫嚷显然同它的美国主子的蓄谋已久的侵略计划有关。这家通讯社在提到傀儡“政府”的上述谈话时，一方面不得不承认这是违反日内瓦协议的，但是它同时又说，“有一个例外规定：如果老挝的安全受到威胁，并不是对老挝的一切限制都是具有约束力的”。
