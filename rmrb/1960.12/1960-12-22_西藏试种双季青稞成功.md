Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa. Tibetan farmers in the Kare District of Langkazi County and the Rema Mutual Aid Team of Mani Township in Changdu County have successfully trial-planted double-season highland barley.

The second season of highland barley trial-planted by farmers in the Kare District of Langkazi County this year was successful on 14 "ke" (one "ke" is equivalent to one "mu," or approximately 0.16 acres), with an average yield of 78 jin (39 kg or 86 lbs) of highland barley per "ke." In the Paba Township, the Second Mutual Aid Team trial-planted one "ke" of land, harvesting 338 jin of highland barley in the first season and 104 jin in the second season. The Rema Mutual Aid Team in Mani Township, Changdu County, trial-planted more than one "ke" of double-season highland barley, yielding 60 jin of grain per "ke." This land had also been planted with the first season of highland barley before.

To trial-plant two seasons of highland barley, the farmers in the Kare District and the Rema Mutual Aid Team advanced the sowing time of the first season of highland barley this spring. The Rema Mutual Aid Team advanced the sowing time by fifty days and harvested the first season of highland barley on June 9th. On the second day after the harvest, they seized the time to plow the land, applied sufficient base fertilizer, and carefully selected the newly harvested highland barley as seeds. After careful management by the farmers, although a hailstorm in early October caused some damage to the second-season highland barley, a certain yield was still obtained after harvesting in early November. The grain harvested from this plot of land by the Rema Mutual Aid Team in two seasons increased by nearly double compared to the yield of other single-season highland barley in the team.

In the past, no one had ever harvested two seasons of highland barley in one year on the Tibetan Plateau. This successful trial planting proves that it is possible for areas with similar conditions on the Tibetan Plateau to gradually change from one crop a year to two crops a year or three crops in two years.

### 西藏试种双季青稞成功

    西藏试种双季青稞成功
    据新华社拉萨电　西藏浪卡子县卡热区和昌都县马尼乡热玛互助组的藏族农民试种双季青稞获得成功。
    浪卡子县卡热区农民今年试种的第二季青稞，有十四克（每克相当于一市亩）获得成功，平均每克收青稞七十八斤。这个区帕巴乡第二互助组试种的一克地，第一季收青稞三百三十八斤，第二季收一百零四斤。昌都县马尼乡热玛互助组试种一克多地二季青稞，每克产粮六十斤。在这以前，这块地上还种了第一季青稞。
    卡热区和热玛互助组的农民，为了试种二季青稞，今年春天都把第一季青稞的播种时间提前。热玛互助组把播种时间提前了五十天，6月9日就收割了第一季青稞，他们在收割后的第二天就抓紧时间翻地，施足底肥，并精选新打下来的青稞作种子。经过农民们精心管理，虽然10月初下了一场冰雹，使二季青稞受到一定损失，但11月初收割后，仍然获得一定的产量。热玛互助组这一块地两季所收的粮食，比组里其他单季青稞产量增加将近一倍。
    西藏高原上过去从来没有一年中收获过二季青稞。这一次试种成功，证明西藏高原上与此条件相同的地区，有可能逐渐变一年一熟为一年两熟或两年三熟。
