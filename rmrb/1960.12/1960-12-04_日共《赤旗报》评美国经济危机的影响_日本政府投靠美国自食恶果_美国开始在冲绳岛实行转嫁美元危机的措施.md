Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 3rd: The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper "Akahata" today published an editorial exposing the Ikeda Cabinet's attempts to conceal the adverse effects of the US economic crisis on Japan. The editorial called on the Japanese people to launch a powerful movement to steer the Japanese economy towards peaceful and independent development.

The editorial refuted the Japanese government's claim that the dollar crisis had no connection with the Japanese economy. The editorial emphasized that the decline in stock prices on the Japanese stock market after the implementation of dollar protection measures was sufficient to illustrate that the US economic crisis had brought serious problems to the Japanese economy.

"Akahata" continued, saying that the Ikeda Cabinet's unwillingness to mention the dollar crisis was because Liberal Democratic Party leaders attempted to use the so-called "only way to make Japan prosperous" – the economic cooperation between Japan and the United States – to win votes during the election. However, because the dollar crisis suddenly became more intense after the election, and under the influence of this crisis, the Ikeda Cabinet's plan to "double the national income" will become unsustainable, they are worried that the economic situation in the United States may be seriously related to their political life.

The editorial warned that, according to the Ikeda Cabinet's policy of cooperating with the United States, Japanese industries will have to adopt hasty "trade liberalization" measures and carry out so-called "enterprise rationalization" at a faster rate than they had considered. Therefore, "this will bring more economic burden to the lives of the people."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 3rd: The United States has begun to implement measures to shift the dollar crisis to Okinawa, a strategic island in the Pacific.

According to Kyodo News, US Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps personnel and their families in Okinawa have received orders from the military stating: "Starting from 00:01 on December 1st, it is forbidden to purchase foreign goods other than American goods."

Additionally, according to the "Asahi Shimbun," the US military authorities also publicly requested military personnel and their families to "not waste," save US dollars, and remit them to the United States.

The newspaper said that the US Air Force authorities in Okinawa also issued an order on December 1st: Starting from the 5th, the outings of subordinate officers and soldiers will be restricted. The Navy authorities are also preparing to issue the same order.

At the same time, the US military engineering corps announced that it will lay off seventy-two Okinawan technicians by January 10th next year.

The "Asahi Shimbun" said that these are part of the measures taken to resolve the US international payment crisis.

The newspaper said that due to the series of measures taken by the US military authorities to shift the dollar crisis, laundry shops, fruit stores, butcher shops, and some bars in Naha City, which mainly rely on the US military for business, have successively closed down.

Okinawa, occupied by the United States, is facing a bleak end to the year.

    日共《赤旗报》评美国经济危机的影响
    日本政府投靠美国自食恶果
    美国开始在冲绳岛实行转嫁美元危机的措施
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报《赤旗报》今天发表社论揭露池田内阁掩饰美国经济危机对日本的不利影响。社论号召日本人民发动强有力的运动，以便把日本经济引向和平和独立的发展方向。
    社论驳斥了日本政府所谓美元危机同日本经济没有关系的说法。社论强调说，在采取美元保护措施以后日本证券交易市场上证券价格的下跌就足以说明，美国经济危机对日本经济带来了严重的问题。
    《赤旗报》继续说，池田内阁不愿意提起美元危机的原因是：自由民主党领袖企图在竞选的时候把日美经济合作说成是“使日本繁荣的唯一办法”以捞取选票。但是，由于美元危机在大选以后突然变得更加激烈起来，而且，在这种危机的影响下，池田内阁所宣传的把“国民收入增加一倍”的计划将变得没有着落，因此他们担心，美国的经济情况对他们的政治生命可能是严重有关的。
    社论警告说，按照池田内阁同美国进行合作的政策，日本的工业将不得不采取轻率的“贸易自由化”的措施，并且以比他们曾考虑到的更快的速度进行所谓“企业合理化”。因此，“这将对人民的生活带来更多的经济负担。”
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：美国开始在太平洋的战略岛屿——冲绳岛实行转嫁美元危机的措施。
    据共同社报道，在冲绳的美国陆军、海军、空军和海军陆战队的军人和家属接到军方的命令说：“从1日上午零时一分起，禁止购买美国货以外的外国货物”。
    另外据《朝日新闻》报道，美军当局还公开要求军人和家属“不要浪费”，把美元存起来，汇到美国去。
    这家报纸说，美国驻冲绳空军当局1日还发出命令：从5日起限制所属官兵外出。海军当局也准备发出同样的命令。
    同时，美军工兵部队宣布，将在明年1月10日以前，解雇七十二名冲绳技术人员。
    《朝日新闻》说，这些是为了解救美国国际支付危机而采取的措施的一部分。
    报纸说，由于美军当局采取这一系列转嫁美元危机的措施，那霸市内主要依靠美军维持生意的浆洗房、水果店、肉铺和一些酒吧间相继倒闭。
    美国霸占的冲绳正在面临着一个阴暗的年终。
