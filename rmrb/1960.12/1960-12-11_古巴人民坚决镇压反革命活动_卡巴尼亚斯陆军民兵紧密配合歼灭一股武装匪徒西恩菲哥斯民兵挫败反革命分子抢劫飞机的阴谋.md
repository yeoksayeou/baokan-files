Xinhua News Agency, Havana, December 9th: A press release from the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces stated that Cuba's revolutionary armed forces and militia yesterday annihilated a group of traitors and counter-revolutionaries in Cabañas, Pinar del Río Province.

The press release stated that a deserting officer, Clodomiro Miranda Martínez, along with a group of counter-revolutionaries, were immediately pursued by the Army's Special Battalion and the militia, who worked closely with the Special Battalion, while transporting weapons from Cabañas to the mountains, and were completely wiped out within a few hours. Clodomiro and his accomplice Gregorio Hernández were seriously injured, and his brother, Roberto Miranda Martínez, was killed. The other seven counter-revolutionaries were captured and will be tried by the Cuban Revolutionary Military Tribunal.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, December 9th: An attempt by counter-revolutionaries to hijack a plane to the United States was thwarted in the city of Cienfuegos, Las Villas Province, Cuba, on the 8th. The four counter-revolutionaries who hijacked the plane have been arrested.

Yesterday afternoon, when a Cuban Airlines plane en route from Santiago to Havana was passing over Cienfuegos, five armed counter-revolutionaries hidden on the plane attempted to hijack the plane by force and forced the pilot to change course and fly to the United States. A fierce struggle immediately broke out on the plane. The pilot, Captain Francisco Martínez, was seriously injured. However, when a rebel soldier guarding the plane bravely fought the counter-revolutionaries, the injured pilot immediately turned the plane back and forcibly landed on the runway at Cienfuegos Airport. In order to prevent the counter-revolutionaries from taking off again, the militia stationed in the military training camp near the airport immediately blocked the runway with several trucks, causing the plane to crash into the trucks, leave the runway, and rush into the sugarcane fields.

Except for one counter-revolutionary who was killed by their leader for expressing willingness to surrender during the struggle, the rest were arrested by the militia.

The plane returned to Havana early this morning.

    古巴人民坚决镇压反革命活动
    卡巴尼亚斯陆军民兵紧密配合歼灭一股武装匪徒西恩菲哥斯民兵挫败反革命分子抢劫飞机的阴谋
    新华社哈瓦那9日电　古巴革命武装部发表的新闻公报说，古巴的革命武装部队和民兵昨天在比那尔德里奥省的卡巴尼亚斯消灭了一批卖国贼和反革命分子。
    公报说，一名开小差的军官克洛多米罗·米兰达·马丁内兹同一批反革命分子在把一些武器从卡巴尼亚斯运到山里去的时候，立即受到陆军特别营和同特别营紧密配合的民兵的追击，并且在几小时内被彻底消灭。克洛多米罗和他的同谋格雷戈里奥·埃尔南德斯受重伤，他的兄弟罗伯托·米兰达·马丁内兹被击毙。其他七名反革命分子被俘，他们将受到古巴革命军事法庭的审讯。
    新华社哈瓦那9日电8日在古巴拉斯维利亚斯省的西恩菲哥斯城挫败了一起反革命分子把一架飞机劫往美国的阴谋。劫夺飞机的四名反革命分子已被逮捕。
    昨天下午，当一架属于古巴航空公司的从圣地亚哥飞往哈瓦那的飞机途经西恩菲哥斯上空时，隐藏在飞机中的五名武装反革命分子企图用武力劫持飞机，并强迫飞行员改变航向，飞往美国。飞机上马上爆发了一场激烈的搏斗。飞行员弗朗西斯科·马丁内斯上尉身受重伤。但是，当警卫飞机的一个起义军士兵英勇地与反革命分子搏斗的时候，这位受伤的飞行员马上使飞机折回，强行降落在西恩菲哥斯机场的跑道上。驻在机场附近的军事训练营中的民兵，为了阻止反革命分子再使飞机起飞，立即用几辆卡车堵住了跑道，使飞机撞上卡车，离开了跑道，冲向甘蔗田。
    除了一个反革命分子由于在搏斗中表示愿意投降而被他们的头子杀死外，其余都被民兵逮捕。
    这架飞机今天清晨已返回哈瓦那。
