A Journey Through the Taklamakan Desert
By our reporter Song Zhenghou

Recently, I accompanied the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Desert Comprehensive Expedition Team on a trip to the world-renowned Taklamakan Desert. We started from the ancient city of Yutian, traveled north into the heart of the desert, lasting more than twenty days, with a round trip of more than three hundred kilometers. In this mysterious land, we saw for the first time the boundless, yellow-wave-rolling face of the desert, the ruins of villages and ancient cities buried by the desert long ago, and also the magnificent feats of the Uyghur people conquering the desert today.

A Booming New Desert Village

In Uyghur, "Taklamakan" means "enter and never come out." When the people of the ancient city of Yutian heard that we were going to enter the desert from here, they were all surprised. Many Uyghur villagers also told us various mysterious legends about the desert.

One clear morning, we left the ancient city of Yutian and traveled north along the Keriya River. After four days, we arrived in the Ye'lie area. Here, the Keriya River, like a winding silver belt, flows far into the north. On the east bank, a ridge-shaped compound sand dune, about seventy or eighty meters high, stands side by side with the river like a natural barrier, resisting the fierce northeasterly wind. Reeds, licorice, wild hemp, red willow, and poplar grow in the river valley. On the west bank, a new levee canal and irrigation ditches as dense as spider webs crisscross. Where the ditches converge, newly cultivated farmland stretches as far as the eye can see, some already showing the new sprouts of wheat seedlings, and some being irrigated and deeply ploughed. Next to the river are rows of newly built reed houses, which are the camps of the reclamation army. This is a new village in the desert, full of thriving scenes.

After a day of exploration, we met Comrade Duan Shaohua, the Party Secretary of the Yutian Pioneer Commune, who was leading the land reclamation here. Duan Shaohua told us: "In February of this year, Wu Jimin, the First Secretary of the Yutian County Party Committee, led more than ten commune cadres, riding donkeys, carrying water canisters and flour sacks, to survey wasteland along the Keriya River. They camped in sand dunes and grass叢 every day, drank raw water and ate dry naan, and in hundreds of miles of travel, they found a lot of surface water and reeds and wetlands, so he said with confidence: 'With water and soil, we can grow crops.'"

"So, more than a thousand men and women from the Pioneer Commune, with their hoes and bedding, came to this sparsely populated place and began the magnificent feat of conquering nature."

"The first problem encountered in desert land reclamation is water. But the riverbed is too low, how can the water be led to the highlands? They built several river dams to raise the water level. From the secretary to the team leader, they all took the lead in plunging down to tie grass and dig mud. After working for a while, they climbed up and lay on the hot sand for a while, then jumped down again. In this way, in just a few days, the backs of every cadre were sunburned and peeling. After the river dam was built, a new difficulty arose: with only a hoe, they had to dig canals on the quicksand. As they dug, the wind blew, filling in behind them as they dug in front. Sometimes the wind blew so hard that they couldn't even open their eyes. Later, the Party Branch Secretary, Semet Rouzi, and everyone else created the "terraced soil transfer method," digging a section and then blocking it with reeds on both banks, finally subduing the wind."

"Difficulties were solved one by one, and the enthusiasm of the masses and cadres was even higher. After several months of struggle, they built three river dams and a thirty-mile-long canal, and also reclaimed 20,000 mu of wasteland. Some have even planted crops. After communization, the members here also built new ironware, brick, hunting, licorice, wild hemp, and poplar alkali processing plants. The former desert has now become a new socialist village. Currently, they are building sand-prevention forests and running large-scale forest farms and ranches. Dormitories, schools, kindergartens, and nurseries in the residential areas are all planned, and some have already started construction."

The Past and Present of Tonggubasti

After eight days of marching, we entered the Keriya River Delta. The river water disappeared, and before us was only a nearly 1,000-meter-wide, dry, pale riverbed. At dusk, a large expanse of mountains, vaguely green and black, appeared before us. We walked towards them, but the mountains disappeared, and before us was a dense sea of ​​trees. In the depths of this forest, we found a small village, with about ten households. An Uyghur elder warmly welcomed us. Only then did we realize that we had reached the center of the vast desert - Tonggubasti.

In the moonlight, we set up the radio to listen to the sounds from the capital. At this time, the villagers also came. They surrounded us, staring intently at the strange and bizarre gadget, and telling us a story about this place. Elder Amaner said that one day in 1953, two strangers in uniforms rode in on donkeys. As soon as they entered the village, all the adults and children in the village hid in the forest, peeking at the strangers' actions, just like they had when they saw Kuomintang officials and landlords before liberation. But strangely, these two people not only did not enter their homes or lead away their sheep, but helped them clean the livestock pens and organize forage. During the day, they drank well water and camped under the eaves at night. At this time, Elder Amaner, with a moved but fearful heart, came out of the forest to greet the strangers. The first thing the strangers told him was that there were no more corrupt officials and profiteers from Yutian here, and that the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army had replaced them, and that they were Communist Party cadres, dedicated to working for the working people. From then on, Amaner knew that the world had changed.

Under the leadership of these two People's Government cadres, Tonggubasti soon embarked on the road of collectivization. Later, the People's Government sent commercial teams and veterinarians to transport cloth, flour, melons, fruits, and vegetables to them. Their lives have greatly improved.

Last year, the Yutian New Life People's Commune was established, and they are one of the livestock breeding teams. With the help of the commune, they built new houses and had sewing shops and blacksmith shops. After communization, their enthusiasm for labor was even higher. They dug wells, built dikes, blocked floods, fetched well water, and planted saplings and pastures. The number of livestock has now increased to more than 6,000. Victory inspires the people here. At the beginning of this year, they opened up 100 mu of wasteland and planted crops, which have been harvested. When the fruits ripened, Elder Amaner held the wheat grains and said with tears in his eyes, "Although we have eaten white flour in recent years, this is the first time we have seen wheat grains."

The Ancient City of Kaladongke

After another day of travel, we arrived at the ancient city of Kaladongke. Everyone wandered around inside and outside the ancient city, some looking for the ruins of walls, some looking for fragments of ancient coins, some busy taking pictures and drawing maps, and some busy collecting soil samples.

The ancient city is circular, with a circumference of several hundred meters. Outside the city are large sand dunes layered on top of each other. Some of these sand dunes are crescent-shaped, some are like pyramids, and some are square grids. Among the sand dunes are dotted red willow and dry poplar. The guide told us humorously that these sand mountains look majestic, but once they encounter wind, they are like sheep, going wherever they are told. Therefore, who knows how many once-prominent ancient kingdoms it has buried. The Kaladongke in front of us is an ancient city buried by wind and sand.

In the relatively low-lying center of the city, we found a large beam that was more than ten feet long. People judged from this evidence that this was where the yamen of the ancient kingdom was located. It is said that 300 years ago, this was an ancient city surrounded by oases. Current investigations have proved that the ancient city was indeed next to an ancient riverbed, and there were many dried poplar, red willow, reeds, and weeds outside the city. In the past, people relied on water and grass to graze and live here. However, several centuries ago, the river changed its course, the herbaceous plants died first, and then the poplar and red willow also lost their adaptability. So the wind and sand invaded, and people had to move, and the ruins of this ancient city were left behind.

We continued to move southeast. In the evening, we crossed a sand mountain, and a water gleam came into view. It is naturally an endless joy to see water deep in the desert. In the trees and grass surrounded by sand mountains, lies quietly a lake of several square kilometers. The lake is dotted with small islands like stars. The lake water is deep and blue, with rippling waves. This unnamed desert "Heavenly Lake" will add endless courage and strength to the people who conquer the desert.

After walking in the desert for more than ten days, we learned that although the lower reaches of the Keriya River have lost their surface water sources, the snow water on the Kunlun Mountains, after a long journey underground, is secretly stored deep in the desert strata. What a precious resource this is! (Attached picture)

    塔克拉玛干大沙漠记行
    本报记者　宋政厚
    最近，记者随中国科学院沙漠综合考察队，到闻名世界的塔克拉玛干大沙漠走了一趟。我们从于田古城出发，北行到沙漠腹地，历时二十多天，往返行程三百多公里。在这片神秘的土地上，我们第一次看到了浩瀚无垠、黄浪滚滚的沙漠面貌，看到了很久以前被沙漠掩埋的村落和古城的废墟，也看到了今天维吾尔族人民征服沙漠的壮举。
    沸腾着的沙漠新村
    “塔克拉玛干”在维吾尔语中是“进去出不来”的意思。于田古城的人们听说我们从这里要进沙漠，大家都很惊奇。许多维吾尔族老乡还告诉了我们关于沙漠里种种神秘的传说。
    一个晴朗的清晨，我们离开于田古城沿克里雅河北行。经过四天，来到也烈地区。在这里，克里雅河像一条弯弯曲曲的银带，一直流逝在那老远的北方。河东一条高约七八十米的垅状复合式沙丘，像一座天然屏障与河流并排屹立，抵御着那猛烈的东北风。河谷中生长着芦苇、甘草、野麻、红柳和胡杨。河西一条新堤大渠和那密如蛛网的灌溉水沟，纵横交错。在沟渠汇织的地方，新垦农田一望无际，有的已经露出麦苗的新芽，有的正在灌水深耕。河旁有一排排苇草新房，这是垦荒大军的营地。这就是沙漠里的新村，它充满着欣欣向荣的景象。
    考察一天之后，我们会见了领导这儿开荒的于田先锋公社党委书记段少华同志，段少华告诉我们：“今年2月，于田县委第一书记吴济民同志，带领十多个公社干部，骑着毛驴，背负水罐面袋，沿克里雅河勘查荒地。每天露宿沙丘草丛，喝生水啃干馕，在几百里行程中，发现不少地面水和苇子、泽地，于是他满怀信心地说：‘有水有土，我们就可以种庄稼’。
    于是先锋公社一千多名男女，带着坎土镘、铺盖卷，来到了这罕有人迹的地方，开始了征服自然的壮举。
    沙漠造田首先碰到的问题就是水。可是河床太低，水怎能引上高地呢？他们筑几条拦河大坝，提高水位。从书记到队长都带头下去扎草挖泥。劳动一会，爬上来在烫热的沙面上躺一会，然后再跳下去。就这样没过几天，每个干部的背上都晒得脱了皮。河坝建成后新的困难又来了，凭着一把坎土镘，要在流沙上面挖渠，一面挖一面刮风，前面挖，后面风又给填上了。有时风刮得连眼睛都没法睁。后来党总支书记色买提肉孜和大家一起，创造了“梯形传土法”，挖一段就在两岸挡上苇子，总算把风制住了。
    困难一个一个解决了，群众和干部的干劲更高了。经过几个月的奋斗，修起三条拦河大坝和一条三十里长的大渠，还开出荒地两万亩。有的还种上了庄稼。公社化后，这里的社员们还新建起了铁业、砖瓦、狩猎、甘草、野麻和胡杨碱等加工厂。昔日的沙漠，现在变成了社会主义的新村。目前，这里正在营造防沙林，大办林场牧场。居民点里的宿舍、学校、幼儿园、托儿所，全都有了规划，有的已开始施工了。”
    同古巴斯忒的今昔
    经过八天的行军，我们进入了克里雅河三角洲地带。河水不见了，眼前只有一条宽近千米、干得发白的河床。黄昏时刻，在我们面前隐隐约约出现一大片似绿似黑的山峦，我们迎面走去，山峦不见了，眼下是一片密集的林海。在这林海深处，我们找到了一个不大的村落，约有十来户人家。一位维吾尔族老人热情地迎接我们，这时我们才知道已经到达了大沙漠中心——同古巴斯忒。
    月夜里，我们架好电台准备从广播中收听由首都传来的声音。这时老乡们也都来了，他们团团围住我们，一面出神地凝视着那离奇古怪的玩艺儿，一面向我们叙说着这里的一个故事。阿曼尔老人说，1953年的一天，来了两个骑着毛驴身着制服的陌生人。当他们刚一进村，村里的大人小孩全都跟解放前看到国民党的官吏和牧主一样，一眨眼就躲进了林海里，暗暗窥视着陌生人的行动。可是奇怪，这两个人不但没进他们的家，牵他们的羊，反而帮他们打扫畜圈，整理草料，白天喝点井水，晚上露宿在檐下。这时，阿曼尔老人带着感动而又疑惧的心情，走出树林与陌生人打招呼。陌生人首先告诉他的，是这里再没有于田的贪官污吏和投机商人了，而代替他们的是共产党和人民解放军，而他们两人就是共产党的干部，是专门为劳动人民做事的，从此阿曼尔才知道世界变了。
    同古巴斯忒，就在这两个人民政府干部的领导下，不久就走上了合作化道路。后来人民政府又派来了商业队、兽医员，给他们运来布匹、面粉、瓜果、菜蔬。他们的生活有了很大改善。
    去年又成立了于田新生人民公社，他们是其中一个畜牧小队。在公社帮助下，他们盖起了新房，有了缝纫店、铁匠铺。公社化后他们劳动积极性更高了，他们打井、筑堤、拦洪水、取井水、营造幼林、培植牧场。牲畜现在已增加六千多只。胜利激励着这里的人们，今年年初他们开了百亩荒地，种的庄稼，已收到果实。当果实成熟的时候，阿曼尔老人捧着麦粒激动得含着热泪说，“这几年我们虽然吃到白面，可还是头一次见到过麦粒。”
    卡拉当克古城
    又走了一天，来到了卡拉当克古城。大伙儿都在古城里外转来转去，有的寻找残垣断壁，有的寻找古钱碎片，有的忙着照相绘图，有的忙着收集沙土标本。
    古城是一环形，周围数百米，城外是层层叠高的大沙丘，这些沙丘有的成半月形，有的像金字塔，还有的是一个个方格。在沙丘之中点缀着红柳和干胡杨。向导有趣地告诉我们，这些沙山看来威风，但一遇上风，却像绵羊一样，叫到哪里就到哪里，因此，不知它埋葬过多少显赫一时的古国。眼前的卡拉当克，就是被风沙埋没的一座古城。
    在比较低洼的城中心，我们找到了一根长达丈余的大梁。人们从这个证据判断，这是古国的衙门所在，相传三百年前，这里是一座绿洲环绕的古城。经目前的考查证明：古城确在古河道之旁，城外有许多干枯了的胡杨、红柳、芦苇和杂草。过去人们凭着水草在这儿放牧生活。然而几个世纪以前，河流改道了，草本植物首先死亡，接着胡杨、红柳也失去适应性，于是风沙入侵，人们只好迁居，这座古城遗迹就这样留了下来。
    我们向东南方向继续前进。傍晚翻越一座沙山，一片水光映入眼帘。在沙漠深处能见到水，自然是无尽的喜悦。在沙山重围的树草丛中，静静地躺着一个方圆数公里的湖泊。湖泊之中点缀着像星星一样的小岛。湖水深而碧蓝，波光荡漾。这座没名的沙漠“天池”，将给征服沙漠的人们增添无穷的勇气和力量。
    在沙漠里走了十多天后，我们知道了克里雅河下游虽然失去了地面水源，然而昆仑山上的雪水，在地下经过漫长的旅程以后，又暗暗地汇存在沙漠地层的深处，这是多宝贵的资源啊！（附图片）
