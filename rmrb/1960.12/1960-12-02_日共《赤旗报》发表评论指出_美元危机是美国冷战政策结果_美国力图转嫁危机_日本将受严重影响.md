Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch from Tokyo: The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper, *Red Flag*, published an article today entitled "The Dollar Crisis and Japan," pointing out that the US dollar crisis will severely affect Japan, which is dependent on the United States.

The article points out that the serious international payment crisis of the United States is directly related to the US insistence on its Cold War policy. In order to maintain US troops stationed abroad and support reactionary groups in various places, the United States allocates billions of dollars every year in the name of "military aid" and "economic aid." The "dollar-saving" measures currently adopted by the United States do not touch these, but attempt to continue to pursue its aggressive policy by shifting the economic crisis to its allies.

The article points out that if this continues to evolve, the United States may ultimately be forced to take measures to restrict the exchange of dollars and even devalue the dollar, which will create serious chaos in the capitalist world economic system. Since Japan has only exchanged 15% of its fifteen billion dollars into gold, Japan will suffer a severe blow when the United States takes the above-mentioned measures.

The article emphasizes that the aggravation of the dollar crisis means the bankruptcy of the policy of "relying on the dollar system," and at the same time means the bankruptcy of the Ikeda Cabinet's line of "relying on the United States to deal with China and the Soviet Union."

    美元危机是美国冷战政策结果
    美国力图转嫁危机　日本将受严重影响
    新华社1日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报《赤旗报》今天发表题为“美元危机与日本”的文章指出，美国的美元危机将严重影响依赖美国的日本。
    文章指出，美国严重的国际支付危机，同美国坚持冷战政策有直接关系。由于维持派到国外的美军和扶持各地反动集团，美国每年以“军事援助”和“经济援助”名义拨出几十亿美元。目前美国采取的“俭省美元”措施并不触动这些，而是企图通过向它的盟国转嫁经济危机的办法来继续推行它的侵略政策。
    文章指出，这样演变下去，美国可能终将被迫采取措施，限制美元的兑换以至贬低美元价值，这将在资本主义世界经济体系中造成严重混乱。日本由于从它所拥有的十五亿美元中只兑换了15％的黄金，所以在美国采取上述措施时，日本将遭到严重的打击。
    文章强调指出，美元危机的严重化，意味着“依靠美元体系”的政策的破产，同时意味着“要以美国为靠山来对付中苏”的池田内阁的路线的破产。
