Prince Sihanouk's Speech

Mr. President of the Republic, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, Dearest Friends,

    As we leave your magnificent capital of Beijing, which grows ever larger and more beautiful with each passing year, and as we bid farewell to so many of our dearest friends who have received us so memorably and expressed such vivid and heartfelt affection for our country, I cannot find the words to express our deeply moved feelings.

    We are about to leave Beijing, but in the next five days, we will still be able to see other equally inspiring aspects of a China moving forward, because we are well aware that in your vast land, from north to south, from east to west, development is taking place everywhere on an equal scale. During the last five days of our visit to your country, we will be able to draw new and encouraging lessons from your efforts and methods used to further accelerate peaceful construction. We can also tell the Chinese people how much we admire their magnificent achievements and express to them the Cambodian people's fraternal friendship.

    Our visit is not only a vivid manifestation of friendship, but also marks a new stage in the cooperation between our two countries. This cooperation has been developing for more than four years and is an example of the successful implementation of the principles of peaceful coexistence between our two countries, which share a love of peace and cherish their respective dignity and independence, in an atmosphere of mutual trust. In this regard, I would like to express my boundless gratitude to our Chinese friends and the Chinese government for their continued material and technical assistance, which is a new and significant contribution to the success of our country's Five-Year Plan and the construction undertaken by our people and government with their modest strength.

    Shortly after we leave China from Guangzhou, we will have another event that will make us extremely honored and happy, that is, His Excellency Chairman Liu Shaoqi has agreed to visit our country in the near future. This news will make our people very happy, and they will surely receive the highest representatives of the People's Republic of China and the great Chinese people with all their hearts, although this reception will never be able to match the hospitality we have received this time.

    Through this visit, our confidence in the future has been strengthened, because, as His Excellency Zhou Enlai recently said, the forces of peace outweigh the forces of war. We will work tirelessly with all our friends, first and foremost the People's China, to make a modest contribution to further understanding between the peoples of all countries, in order to eliminate all violent ideas and aggressive consciousness from our continent.

    I would like to conclude my speech with the following wishes. Please allow me to express our warm wishes that our great friends, the People's Republic of China, will achieve increasingly great and glorious achievements in their valiant advance towards progress, that their wise and outstanding leaders will enjoy good health and vigor, and that the dynamic and courageous Chinese people will enjoy a peaceful life of unparalleled happiness and prosperity.

    Long live the People's Republic of China!

    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong and Chairman Liu Shaoqi!

    Long live Premier Zhou Enlai and the Chinese Government!

    May the people of Beijing and all the people of China be happy and prosperous!

    Glory to the eternal friendship and close fraternal cooperation between Cambodia and China!

    Long live world peace!

### 西哈努克亲王的讲话

专栏：

    西哈努克亲王的讲话共和国主席先生，阁下们，女士们，先生们，最亲爱的朋友们，
    在我们离开你们一年比一年更大更美的雄伟首都北京的时候，在我们向这么多曾经令人难忘地接待我们并且对我国表示了极为生动和发自内心的情谊的最亲爱的朋友们告别的时候，我找不出言词来向你们表达我们万分激动的心情。
    我们就要离开北京，但是在未来的五天里，我们还可以看到前进中的中国同样振奋人心的另外一些方面，因为我们很清楚在贵国辽阔的土地上，从北到南，从东到西，到处都以同等的规模在发展。在我们访问贵国的最后五天中，我们将能在你们为进一步加速和平建设所作的努力和使用的方法中吸取新的令人鼓舞的教益。我们也可以告诉中国人民，我们对他们的宏伟的成就是多么钦佩，并向他们表示柬埔寨人民对他们的兄弟般的友谊。
    我们的访问不仅是友谊的生动体现，而且标志着我们两国的合作进入了一个新的阶段。四年多以来这种合作不断发展着，这种合作是我们两个同样爱好和平、珍视各自的尊严和独立的国家，在互相信任的气氛中成功地执行和平共处原则的范例。在这方面，我谨向中国朋友和中国政府表示无限感激，感谢他们继续给予我们物资和技术援助，这对我国的五年计划以及我国人民和政府以其微薄的力量所进行的建设获得成功是一种新的重大贡献。
    不久以后，当我们从广州离开中国的时候，还将有一件使我们感到极其荣幸和愉快的事，那就是刘少奇主席阁下已经同意在不久的将来光临我国进行访问。这个消息将使我国人民感到非常高兴，并且，他们一定会全心全意地接待中华人民共和国和伟大的中国人民的最高代表，尽管这种接待怎么也不会比得上我们这次所受到的款待。
    通过这次访问，我们对未来的信心更加强了，因为，正如周恩来阁下最近所说的那样，和平力量压倒战争力量。我们将同所有的朋友首先是人民中国一起，进行不懈的努力为各国人民间的进一步了解作出微薄的贡献，以便在我们的大陆上消除一切暴力思想和侵略意识。
    我谨以下面的祝词来结束我的讲话。请允许我表示我们热烈的祝愿，祝我们伟大的朋友——中华人民共和国在向着进步奋勇前进中取得日益巨大和辉煌的成就，祝他们英明杰出的领导人身体健康精力充沛，祝富有朝气和勇敢的中国人民享有无比幸福和繁荣的和平生活。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    毛泽东主席和刘少奇主席万岁！
    周恩来总理和中国政府万岁！
    祝北京市人民和全中国人民幸福繁荣！
    光荣归于柬中两国万古长青的友谊和紧密的兄弟般的合作！
    世界和平万岁！
