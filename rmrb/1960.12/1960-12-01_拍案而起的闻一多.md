Wen Yiduo slapped the table and rose in anger, glaring at the Kuomintang's guns, preferring to fall rather than submit. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: Wen Yiduo "demonstrated the heroic spirit of our nation." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume IV, page 1499)

Yiduo and Mr. Zhu Ziqing had completely different personalities. Mr. Ziqing was careful, reserved, gentle, and never spoke harshly. Yiduo, on the other hand, was bold, forthright, eloquent, and spoke out loudly, sometimes with tears in his eyes.

The most profound impression was during one meeting, probably the Tsinghua University graduate student examination meeting. At that time, a wave of anti-Soviet sentiment had just passed. Some examination committee members arrived, but the graduate students had not yet arrived, so everyone began to chat. One of the Kuomintang's apologist philosophers, deliberately asked Yiduo:

"Some people say that your Democratic League is the Communist Party's tail. Why be a tail?"

He originally expected Yiduo to be flustered by this sudden attack, but who knew Yiduo answered very simply:

"We are the Communist Party's tail. The Communist Party is doing the right thing. If there's a head, there's a tail. What's wrong with being a tail?"

This shut the philosopher up, and it was he, not Yiduo, who was flustered.

Yes, Yiduo's answer represented the political line of many of us at the time: follow the Communist Party.

However, it must be explained that at that time, the political, theoretical, and ideological level of us few was very low. First, we didn't understand Marxism-Leninism, although we had studied some books, we understood the words, but not the spiritual essence. Second, we didn't understand the Communist Party. We knew that the Communist Party was resolutely resisting Japan and working for the people, and we admired them very much, but we didn't know much else. Third, we hated the Kuomintang, hated it for harming the country and the people, and for committing all kinds of evils.

Therefore, at that time, we had our own standard for judging right and wrong: whatever the Communist Party did must be good, and whatever the Kuomintang did must be bad. For example, just a few days before the graduate student examination, the Kuomintang reactionaries conspired to launch a large-scale anti-Soviet movement and published a declaration, which more than a hundred people at the Southwest Associated University signed. Someone also came to ask Yiduo to sign. Yiduo inquired about a professor who lived diagonally opposite his house, who had also signed and was also a leader of the Democratic League. From that person, he learned that the signing was being led by several notorious Kuomintang members. Yiduo then came to discuss it with me, and we believed that this must be a bad thing. Not only did we not sign, but we also came up with a way to publish a public statement through the intermediate elements who had been fooled into signing, exposing the Kuomintang reactionaries' conspiracy.

Yiduo's slapping the table and rising in anger was taught by two teachers, one positive teacher was the Chinese Communist Party, and one negative teacher was the Kuomintang reactionaries. In terms of time, the negative teacher came first, and the positive teacher came later.

In his early years, when Yiduo studied in the United States, and even for a period after returning to China, he was a nationalist. He joined the Great River Society (the predecessor of the State Socialist Party) and opposed the Communist Party. In 1926, at the age of twenty-eight, he wrote to a friend saying: "The red scourge is rampant in the country. The responsibility of us nationalists is especially great at this time, and progress is even more difficult. Nationalism and communism will inevitably have a fierce battle in the near future." Around April and May 1927, the Kuomintang took over the National Socialist stronghold of Wusong Political University, and Yiduo seemed to break away from practical politics from then on, burying himself in writing new poetry, turning to the study of classical Chinese literature, and living the life of a poet and scholar in an ivory tower, until 1943, when he slapped the table and rose in anger, becoming another Wen Yiduo, a democratic fighter.

Reality educated Yiduo. At this time, the Kuomintang reactionaries were politically corrupt, with big officials engaging in big corruption and small officials engaging in small corruption; militarily, they were experts at internal warfare but amateurs at external warfare, using their full armed forces to deal with the Communist Party, but retreating repeatedly in the face of Japanese imperialist aggression, ceding thousands of miles of territory, while still shouting about their "strategic retreat" in the newspapers all day long. They demanded grain and soldiers from the people, draining the pond to catch all the fish, binding up strong men, humiliating and abusing them, turning them into sick and dying soldiers. And what about public employees? The legal tender was depreciating daily, and prices were skyrocketing daily. Some professors ran the滇缅路(Burma Road) to do business, while others set up stalls to sell scraps. Except for a few, the vast majority could not survive.

From his own experience, Yiduo gradually recognized the true face of the Kuomintang, from admiration to doubt, to hatred and opposition.

He had five children, and the family burden was very heavy. However, he had backbone and never bowed his head to the Kuomintang. When he couldn't make a living, he taught part-time at a middle school, earning a little over a dan (approximately 100 lbs) of rice a month. Later, he couldn't even teach part-time, so he learned to carve seals, both stone seals and ivory seals, and barely supported his large family with this handicraft.

Under these circumstances, Yiduo began to openly criticize the Kuomintang in the classroom and at some gatherings.

Young people also educated Yiduo. Because Yiduo did not conceal his views on the Kuomintang, progressive elements among the youth, including individual underground Communist Party members, gradually gathered around Yiduo, discussing current affairs and exchanging opinions. Yiduo's political leanings became increasingly clear and firm.

It was also at this time that some of us secretly organized a symposium, with a dozen or so members. Among them were one or two Communist Party members. The purpose of the symposium was to study the Party's policies and analyze current affairs, and to plan the struggle. The location was sometimes in a garden, and sometimes we hired a boat to cruise on Dianchi Lake. At these meetings, we initially learned the principles of the Chinese society being small at both ends and large in the middle, the United Front policy, the relationship between the individual and the collective, and so on. Later, we obtained Party documents such as "On Coalition Government," "On New Democracy," and "On the Anti-Japanese War Behind Enemy Lines," as well as publications such as "Xinhua Daily" and "The Masses," and eagerly devoured them, and our understanding of politics gradually improved.

Under the negative education of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the positive education of the Party, Yiduo resolutely joined the ranks of the people's democratic struggle.

At the current affairs evening held at Yunnan University on May 7, 1944, the chairman said that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss academic research. He shouted loudly: "We can't even get enough to eat, what are we researching? Even if others don't want us to make trouble, we must make trouble. The country has come to this point, if we don't care, who will!"

Not only among students and the masses, but even at the current affairs forums of Kuomintang warlords, he said passionately: "Now there is only one way, revolution!"

On the Lu Xun memorial meeting on October 19, he admitted that he was wrong to scold Lu Xun in the past: "Lu Xun was right, we were wrong. We wanted to be aloof, but our aloofness has brought the country to this point. Others say I associate with political activists, yes, I want to associate with them!"

He not only associated with them, but also bravely participated in the struggle.

After receiving the Party's education, he also had a new understanding of American-style education. At the Alumni Association of the Southwest Associated University at the end of April 1946, he said publicly:

"The American education we received in the past was really bad, teaching us to separate from the people, almost ruining my life. Becoming a professor, becoming a principal, having a position, makes us seem different, but what's so great about that? Others think I'm scolding people; but why shouldn't I scold what's wrong?"

On the contrary, he realized that power comes from the people. He said in a speech to the students returning to school from the army:

"Don't think that intellectuals have power. Real power lies in the people. We should combine our knowledge with their power. Without knowledge, it is impossible, but knowledge without the power of the people is useless! We intellectuals often exaggerate and think we are great, but we never think that once the people awaken and mobilize, the real power is in them."

In "Beasts, Men, and Ghosts," a short article denouncing the Kuomintang reactionaries, he said:

"Anyway, we must remember that humans and beasts are irreconcilable, and we also firmly believe that final victory will belong to humans!"

He severely criticized his peers at the time. In an article recalling his eight years at the Southwest Associated University, he said:

"The younger they are these days, the more they can see the big picture. Middle-aged people with extensive knowledge and abilities can only nitpick at minor details. Just when young people are raising their heads to be human beings, middle-aged people are kneeling before the dark tyranny. Who should learn from whom?"

He wanted to raise his head and ask about politics. He said elsewhere:

"From not asking about politics to asking about politics, from being non-partisan to being partisan, this change, from the objective environment, is the compulsion of the times. From the subjective understanding, it is the awakening of thought. We are awakened to the fact that the neutral attitude of strictly adhering to neutrality and not hearing or asking about the past was either being deceived or deceiving ourselves. If we were praised as aloof scholars and experts yesterday, then we are indeed awakened today, knowing that such praise is ill-intentioned sugar-coating, because only when we are aloof can the gentlemen dare to do their despicable cannibalistic deeds with impunity."

From 1943, Yiduo participated in every democratic movement in Kunming. At every meeting, he spoke generously, inspiring emotions and promoting fighting spirit. He participated in the anti-civil war current affairs evening held by Kunming students on the evening of November 25, 1945. After the "December 1st" tragedy, he fought against the reactionaries with the students.

After the Kuomintang's anti-Soviet movement arose, the Kuomintang reactionaries gave Yiduo a name, calling him Wen Yiduo-fu (a derogatory nickname). The walls of Jinri Building in the center of Kunming were plastered with abusive and insulting words. Before and after this, there were many rumors that the Kuomintang government wanted to assassinate Yiduo. Concerned friends advised him to be careful, but he just smiled.

After the last group of students from the Southwest Associated University left Kunming, on July 11, Kuomintang secret agents killed Li Gongpu with a silenced pistol. Friends repeatedly warned Yiduo that there was absolutely reliable news that the Kuomintang reactionaries were about to strike, but Yiduo still just smiled: "Things have come to this point. If I don't come out, then everything will stop. How can I comfort the dead?" At the Li Gongpu memorial service held at Yunnan University on the 15th, Yiduo bravely faced the secret agents present and denounced them:

"Secret agents, think about it, how many days do you have left? Truth will surely triumph. The end of the reactionaries is our dawn!"

Finally, he said:

"We must prepare to be like Mr. Li, with our front foot stepping out the door, and our back foot not preparing to step back in!"

Two hours later, he glared at the Kuomintang's guns and fell.

From 1943 to 1946, in this short period of just over three years, Yiduo wrote a glorious page in the history of the Chinese people's struggle. He demonstrated the heroic spirit of our nation. He was a staunch, upright, and heroic democratic fighter. He inherited the fine traditions of our nation, and his excellent qualities will always be worthy of our remembrance and study.

    拍案而起的闻一多
    吴晗
    “闻一多拍案而起，横眉怒对国民党的手枪，宁可倒下去，不愿屈服。”毛泽东同志指出：闻一多“表现了我们民族的英雄气概。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷1499页）
    一多和朱自清先生的性格是完全不同的，自清先生小心、拘谨，温文尔雅，从来不会厉色疾言。一多呢，豪放，爽朗，侃侃而谈，大声疾呼，有时候会声泪俱下。
    印象最深刻的，是在有一次会议中，大概是清华大学考试研究生的会吧，那时候，一阵反苏高潮刚过去，考试委员来了些人，研究生还没来，大家便闲谈起来。其中有一个国民党御用哲学家，清华大学的权要故意问一多：
    “有人说，你们民主同盟是共产党的尾巴，为什么要当尾巴？”
    他本来期望一多会因此突袭而张皇失措，谁知一多回答得极干脆：
    “我们就是共产党的尾巴，共产党做得对。有头就有尾，当尾巴有什么不好？”
    这一来，把这位哲学家的词锋煞回去了，张皇失措的不是一多，而是他自己。
    是的，一多的回答代表了当时我们不少人的政治路线：跟着共产党走。
    但是，必须说明，在当时，我们这些少数人的政治、理论、思想水平是很低的，一，不懂马克思列宁主义，虽然也啃过一点书，文字懂了，精神实质并不很懂。二，不了解共产党，共产党坚决抗战，在为人民办事，我们知道，很钦佩，其他的就不甚清楚了。三，恨国民党，恨它祸国殃民，无恶不作。
    以此，当时，我们有一个自己的判断是非的标准，凡是共产党作的一定是好事，国民党干的一定是坏事。举例说，就在研究生考试的前些日子，国民党反动派阴谋搞了个大规模的反苏运动，发表了宣言，西南联合大学有一百多个人签了名。有人也来找一多签名，一多打听了一下，住在他家斜对面的一位签了名的教授，也是当时民主同盟的负责人，从此人口中，知道主持签名的是几个臭名昭著的国民党员。一多就来和我商量，我们就认为这一定是坏事，不但不签名，还想了个法子，通过当时被愚弄的签了名的中间分子，发表公开声明，揭穿国民党反动派的阴谋。
    一多的拍案而起，有两个教员，一个正面教员是中国共产党，一个反面教员是国民党反动派。就时间说，反面教员在前，正面教员在后。
    一多早年在美国留学的时候，以至回国后的一个时期，是国家主义者，他参加了大江社（国社党的前身），反对共产党。1926年，他那年二十八岁，写信给一个朋友说：“国内赤祸猖獗，我辈国家主义者际此责任尤其重大，进行益加困难。国家主义与共产主义势将在最近时期内有剧烈的战斗。”到1927年4、5月间，国家主义者的据点吴淞政治大学被国民党接收了，一多从此也似乎对现实政治脱离接触，埋头写新诗，转而研究中国古典文学，过象牙塔里诗人、学者的生活，一直到1943年，才拍案而起，成为另外一个闻一多，民主斗士。
    现实教育了一多。这时候国民党反动派在政治上贪污腐化，大官大贪，小官小贪；军事上内战内行，外战外行，全副武装对付共产党，对日本帝国主义的侵略，却节节败退，蹙地千里，还成天在报纸上大嚷其“转进”。对老百姓要粮要丁，竭泽而渔，把壮丁绑走，凌辱虐待，变成病丁、死丁。对公教人员呢？法币天天贬值，物价天天飞涨，教授们有的跑滇缅路做买卖，有的摆地摊卖破烂，除了少数人以外，绝大多数人都活不下去了。
    一多从亲身的经历，逐步认识了国民党的真实面目，从崇拜而怀疑，而仇恨、反对。
    他有五个孩子，家庭负担很重。但是，他有骨气，从来没有向国民党低过头。没办法过日子，就到中学兼课，一个月多得一担米。后来兼课兼不成了，便学刻图章，石章牙章都刻，靠着这手工行业，勉强养活大大小小一家人。
    在这种情况下，一多在讲堂上，在有些集会上，开始公开批评国民党了。
    青年人也教育了一多，由于一多不隐讳自己对国民党的看法，青年中的进步分子，包括个别地下党员，逐渐围绕到一多的周围，讨论时事，交换意见，一多的政治倾向日渐明朗、坚定了。
    也正在这个时候，我们一些人秘密组织一个座谈会，成员有十几个人。其中有一两个是共产党员。座谈的目的是学习党的政策和分析时事，计划斗争。地点有时在一家花园里，有时雇一条船，到滇池漫游。在这些会上，我们初步知道中国社会两头小中间大，统一战线政策，个人和集体的关系等等道理。以后我们又得到《论联合政府》、《新民主主义论》、《论敌后战场》等党的文献和《新华日报》、《群众》等刊物，如饥似渴地抢着阅读，对政治的认识便日渐提高了。
    在国民党反动派的反面教育，和党的正面教育之下，一多便毅然决然参加了人民民主斗争的行列。
    1944年5月7日在云南大学举行的时事晚会，主席说这个会的目的是讨论学术研究。他大声喊：“饭都吃不饱，研究什么？别人不叫我们闹，我们就是要闹，国家到了这步田地，我们不管，还有谁管！”
    不只是在学生、群众中，甚至在国民党军阀的时事座谈会上，他也激昂地说：“现在只有一条路，革命！”
    10月19日在鲁迅逝世纪念会上，他承认过去骂鲁迅是错了：“鲁迅对，我们错了。我们要清高，清高弄得国家这步田地，别人说我和政治活动的人来往，是的，我就要和他们来往！”
    他不止是来往，而且，勇敢地参加了斗争。
    在受了党的教育之后，他对美国式教育也有了新的认识。1946年4月底，他在联大校友会上公开说：
    “我们过去受的美国教育实在太坏了，教我们和人民脱离，几乎害了我一辈子。做了教授，做了校长，有了地位，就显得不同，但是这些有什么了不起？别人又以为我在骂人；可是不对的为什么不该骂？”
    相反，他认识到：力量来自人民。他对从军回校同学讲话里说：
    “不要以为有了知识分子就有力量，真正力量在人民。我们应该把自己的知识配合他们的力量。没有知识是不行的，但是知识不配合人民的力量，决无用处！我们知识分子常常夸大，以为很了不起，却没想到人民一醒觉，一发动起来，真正的力量就在他们身上。”
    在《兽·人·鬼》这篇痛斥国民党反动派的短文中，他说：
    “反正我们要记得，人兽是不两立的，而我们也深信，最后胜利必属于人！”
    对当时他同辈的中年人，他严厉提出批评，在联大八年回忆与感想一文中说：
    “这年头愈是年青的，愈能识大体，博学多能的中年人反而只会挑剔小节。正当青年们昂起头来做人的时候，中年人却在黑暗的淫威面前屈膝了。究竟是谁应该向谁学习？”
    他要昂起头来，过问政治。他在另一个地方说：
    “从不问政治到问政治，从无党无派到有党有派，这一转变，从客观环境说，是时代的逼迫。从主观认识说，是思想的觉悟。我们觉悟了我们昨天那种严守中立，不闻不问的那种超然态度，不是受人欺骗，便是自欺欺人。昨天如果我们是被人捧为超然的学者专家，超然起来的，那么，我们今天确是觉悟了，知道那种捧是不怀好意的灌米汤，因为只有我们超然，老爷们才更敢放手干他们的卑鄙的吃人勾当。”
    从1943年开始，一多参加了昆明每次的民主运动，在每次会上，他都慷慨发言，激励情绪，发扬斗志。他参加了1945年11月25日晚上昆明学生举行的反内战时事晚会，“一二·一”惨案发生，他和学生一起，向反动派进行斗争。
    在国民党的反苏运动起来以后，一多被国民党反动派起了一个名字，叫闻一多夫。在昆明市中心近日楼的墙上，贴满了谩骂侮辱的文字。在此前后，多次传说国民党政府要暗杀一多，关心的朋友劝他小心，他只是笑笑。
    到西南联大最后一批学生离开昆明以后，7月11日国民党特务用无声手枪杀了李公朴。朋友们再三劝告一多，已经有绝对可靠消息，国民党反动派要下手了，一多还只是笑笑：“事已至此，我不出，则诸事停顿，何以慰死者？”到15日在云南大学举行的李公朴追悼会上，一多英勇地面对着在场的特务痛斥：
    “特务们，你们想想，你们还有几天？真理是一定胜利的。反动派的末日，就是我们的光明！”
    最后，他说：
    “我们要准备像李先生一样，前足跨出大门，后脚就不准备再跨进大门！”
    两小时以后，他横眉怒对国民党的手枪，倒下去了。
    从1943年到1946年，这短短的三年多时间，一多为中国人民斗争的历史写下光辉的一页，他表现了我们民族的英雄气概。他是刚强的，正直的，英勇的民主斗士。他继承了我们民族的优良传统，他的这些优良品质，永远值得我们怀念和学习。
