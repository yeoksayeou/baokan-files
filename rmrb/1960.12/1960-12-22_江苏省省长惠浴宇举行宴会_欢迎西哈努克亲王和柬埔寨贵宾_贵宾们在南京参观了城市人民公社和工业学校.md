We express our heartfelt admiration for this."

These flowers are the Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and some other new agreements.

The Cambodian people will never forget the contributions made by the Chinese people to support their efforts."

He said, "Cambodia and China are also spiritually close, because we are fundamentally united in our goals of maintaining peace, yearning for progress and justice, and hoping to be friends with the people of all countries in the world. This unity of ideals also promotes the consolidation of our friendship and cooperation, enabling it to withstand any tests it faces today." Prince Sihanouk concluded by proposing a toast to the prosperity of the People's Republic of China and to the unbreakable friendship between Cambodia and China.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 21st: Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk and other distinguished guests were warmly welcomed by the people of Nanjing when they visited Nanjing today.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi and his wife, Jiangsu Provincial Governor Hui Yuyu, Nanjing Mayor Chen Yang and others accompanied the distinguished guests on their visit.

Prince Sihanouk and other distinguished guests first visited the Wulaocun branch of the Baixia People's Commune in Nanjing City in the afternoon. This branch of the urban people's commune is mainly composed of street residents, with a total of more than 12,000 households. When the distinguished guests arrived by car, gongs and drums were sounded in the streets and alleys, and thousands of residents waved small flags to warmly welcome them. Prince Sihanouk waved to the commune members from time to time. As he passed through some alleys, he also entered the homes of commune members to warmly greet the hosts.

The distinguished guests visited the canteen, kindergarten, branch industrial exhibition hall, and a small garden built on the site of a stinking ditch. In the kindergarten, Prince Sihanouk and his wife warmly shook hands and kissed the children. A group of five- and six-year-old children waved their hands and welcomed the distinguished guests with crisp songs.

The distinguished guests entered the community-run radio factory, which was filled with the sound of machines. This branch runs 29 factories of various sizes, and 80% of the employees are former housewives. Prince Sihanouk and his wife carefully watched the female commune members operating machines and assembling radios in the radio factory. Prince Sihanouk said to the head of the branch, "Your method is very good. From here, we can see that your government has brought you many benefits and fully reflects the government's concern for the people."

Prince Sihanouk and other distinguished guests then visited the Radio Industry School. Thousands of teachers and students lined up on the campus to shout welcome slogans to the distinguished guests. All the windows of the five or six tall buildings on both sides of the road were filled with welcomers who enthusiastically cheered the distinguished guests. Prince Sihanouk constantly waved to them in greeting.

The distinguished guests carefully visited the school's industrial product exhibition hall, electrical engineering laboratory, and various workshops of the affiliated factory. In order to implement the policy of combining education with productive labor, this secondary technical school established a school-affiliated factory in 1958, with a total of seven workshops, as a place for students and teachers to practice. The precision instruments and equipment such as motors, electron tubes, and ionization vacuum gauges manufactured by teachers and students attracted the attention of the distinguished guests. In the electron tube workshop, Prince Sihanouk watched the students' operations in particular detail. He said: This is a very interesting and large-scale school. Your students have technology, and you combine theory with practice. This shows that your education is developing rapidly. When Prince Sihanouk and other distinguished guests left the school, the head of the school gave Prince Sihanouk a delicate radio manufactured by the students themselves. Prince Sihanouk said: "Thank you very much for your welcome, and I hope you will convey my thanks to the teachers and students." He also said: "You have made great achievements, and I hope you will continue to move forward."

This morning, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, Governor Hui Yuyu, and Mayor Chen Yang, the distinguished guests also paid their respects at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. Afterwards, they toured scenic spots and historical sites such as the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum and Xuanwu Lake.
