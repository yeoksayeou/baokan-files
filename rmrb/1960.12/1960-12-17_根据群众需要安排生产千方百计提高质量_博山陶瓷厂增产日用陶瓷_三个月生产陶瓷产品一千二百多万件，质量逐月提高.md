According to a report from the *Dazhong Daily*:

    Arrange Production According to the Needs of the Masses, Strive to Improve Quality
    Boshan Ceramic Factory Increases Production of Daily-Use Ceramics
    Three Months of Production Yields Over 12 Million Ceramic Products, Quality Improving Month by Month

    This newspaper reports: The Boshan Ceramic Factory in Zibo City, Shandong Province, has established a firm perspective of serving the masses, actively increasing the production of daily-use ceramic products. From September to the end of November this year, the factory has produced 12.67 million ceramic products, with product quality exceeding national standards month by month.

    This factory mainly produces porcelain for daily life. According to market needs and user feedback, the factory's Party committee decided in September of this year to immediately stop producing products that are not urgently needed by the masses and are overstocked within the factory. It also decided to vigorously increase the production of large-volume daily-use ceramic products that are in short supply in the market and to actively organize trial production of products that are urgently needed by the masses but not currently produced by the factory. Workshops and production processes formulated production plans and measures based on this decision of the Party committee, so that the factory's production of daily-use ceramics was closely integrated with the needs of the masses.

    In increasing the production of daily-use ceramics, the factory faced many difficulties in terms of technology and equipment due to the reform and increase in product variety. In order to rapidly increase variety and improve output and quality, the factory's Party committee organized workers to prioritize the key issues in production and then adopted different measures to solve them specifically based on different situations. The main difficulty encountered in producing new products was equipment. For example, in the production of warming bottles, which are urgently needed by the masses, there was a shortage of kiln mud models, and the manufacture of kiln mud models requires four processes: mixing materials, forming, firing, and so on. Overall, it would take at least half a month to complete four hundred sets of models. Aiming at this key issue, the workers in the processing workshop used their brains and adopted the method of plaster casting, completing the manufacturing task of more than four hundred sets of new models in only five days, increasing the daily output of warming bottles from more than eighty to more than five hundred. The main difficulty encountered in reforming product specifications and restoring well-known brands was technical issues. The factory's Party committee selected 166 workers with high technical skills from four workshops to specialize in production. For the five-piece nesting bowls urgently needed by the masses, the workers boldly innovated technology, using machines to replace manual mud making, thus increasing production efficiency by more than 15%. Due to the significant increase in products that meet the needs of the masses, product sales have been brisk and corporate income has also increased accordingly.

    While vigorously increasing new products and improving output, the factory also prominently focused on improving the quality of daily-use ceramics. In addition to sending more than a dozen people to ceramic factories in Jingdezhen, Changsha, and other places to seek teachers and friends, learn from experience, and study advanced techniques, the factory's Party committee also focused on product quality while arranging plans, inspecting production, summarizing work, and evaluating and rewarding. Therefore, since October, the quality of major products has improved month by month. In October, it increased by 0.49% to 1.33% compared to September, and in November, it increased by 0.6% to 5.1% compared to October.

    根据群众需要安排生产千方百计提高质量
    博山陶瓷厂增产日用陶瓷
    三个月生产陶瓷产品一千二百多万件，质量逐月提高
    本报讯　据大众日报消息：山东省淄博市博山陶瓷厂树立牢固为群众服务的观点，积极增产日用陶瓷产品，从今年9月至11月底三个月中，已生产陶瓷产品一千二百六十七万件，产品质量月月超过国家规定标准。
    这个厂以生产生活用瓷为主。厂党委根据市场需要和用户意见，今年9月决定对于群众不急需而厂内有积压的产品，立即停止生产；对于市场供应不足的大宗日用陶瓷产品，大力增加生产；对于群众迫切需要而厂内原来不生产的产品，积极组织试制。各车间、工序根据党委这一决定，纷纷制订了生产计划和措施，使全厂的日用陶瓷生产紧紧和群众需要结合在一起。
    这个厂在增加日用陶瓷生产中，由于产品品种的改革和增加，在技术、设备等方面带来许多困难。为了迅速增加品种，提高产量和质量，这个厂党委组织职工对生产中的关键进行了排队，然后根据不同情况，采取不同措施，具体加以解决。在生产新产品中遇到的主要困难是设备问题。如生产群众急需的取暖温瓶，窑泥模型不足，而窑泥模型的制造，需要经过拌料、成型、烧成等四道工序。总的计算起来，要完成四百套模型，最短也得半个多月的时间。针对这一关键，加工车间的职工开动脑筋，采用石膏浇铸的办法，仅用了五天时间就完成了四百多套新模型的制造任务，使取暖瓶的日产量由原来的八十多件，提高到五百多件。在改革产品规格、恢复名牌产品中，遇到的主要困难是技术问题。厂党委就从四个车间中挑选出一百六十六名技术较高的工人，专门进行生产。对群众急需的套五盆，职工们大胆革新技术，用机器代替手工制泥，因而生产效率提高了15％以上。由于适应群众需要的产品大增，因而产品畅销，企业收入也随之增加。
    在大抓增加新产品，提高产量的同时，这个厂还突出地抓住了提高日用陶瓷质量这一工作。他们除抽出十几个人分赴景德镇、长沙等地的陶瓷厂寻师访友、取经探宝、学习先进经验外，厂党委还在布置计划、检查生产、总结工作、评比奖励的同时，大抓产品质量。因此，从10月份以来，主要产品质量逐月提高。10月份比9月份分别提高了0.49％到1.33％，11月份又分别比10月份提高了0.6％至5.1％。
