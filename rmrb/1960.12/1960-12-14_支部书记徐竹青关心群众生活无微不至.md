    Branch Secretary Xu Zhuqing Cares for the Masses Meticulously
    Comrade Xu Zhuqing, the Party Branch Secretary of the Xiaosanjiazi Management Area of the Sijiazi Commune in Aihui County, Heilongjiang Province, cares for the lives of all commune members meticulously with lofty class sentiments. She often visits the homes of commune members to inquire about their well-being. From eating, housing, and clothing, to weddings, funerals, illnesses, and hygiene, from the elderly to the children in nurseries, she earnestly helps to arrange and solve all practical life problems based on the Party's policies and the principle of developing production. Her care has won the sincere love and respect of the vast majority of commune members, who all sincerely praise her: "The secretary is closer than a relative."

    Arranging Life According to the Seasons
    People's lives are multifaceted and complex. Because Comrade Xu Zhuqing has persisted in participating in production and leading production for many years, sharing joys and hardships with commune members, she has thus explored a set of rules for grasping life, so that complex and diverse life problems can be rationally arranged according to needs and possibilities, with both focus and comprehensive care, to achieve close integration and mutual promotion between production and life. This rule is: focus on disease prevention in spring, combine work and rest in summer, prepare for winter in autumn, distribute income in winter, and manage the canteen year-round.

    Spring is a season when diseases are prone to occur, so Xu Zhuqing puts sanitation and ensuring the health of commune members on the branch's work agenda. This spring, she and all the comrades of the branch led the commune members in carrying out a thorough clean-up of the village's environment. They dug drainage ditches, cleared garbage and manure, built new toilets, leveled the roadbeds, and assigned two and a half able-bodied laborers to be responsible for cleaning the streets every day (combined with manure accumulation). Every spring, Xu Zhuqing also personally goes door-to-door to supervise and inspect, and helps the caregivers to disinfect the nursery and kindergarten, and give children vaccinations. When people are not sick, it is the most powerful guarantee for spring plowing production.

    In summer, the days are long and the nights are short, production is intense, and people are most prone to fatigue. Xu Zhuqing particularly emphasizes the combination of work and rest, allowing commune members to have sufficient rest time. When each production task is completed, the team stipulates a day off. She sets an example by using the field, the canteen, and cadres and commune members to discuss work, and tries not to hold large meetings. Even when there are meetings, they are brief and clear, and work starts immediately after they are finished. In order to avoid commune members drinking raw water while working in the fields, she suggested bringing large pots to the fields to boil water for the commune members to drink on the spot. In order to enable commune members to rest well at noon, she took the lead in setting up sunshades in the fields. Everyone said with emotion: "This is great." A poem is also circulating among the commune members: "Sunshades dispel the heat, hot water warms the heart; good stories spread in the fields, the Party is closer than anyone else."

    In autumn, Comrade Xu Zhuqing always considers arranging commune members' winter lives in advance. This year, she and the team cadres studied the matter and seized the limited time before the autumn harvest to give the commune members a few days off, organizing male commune members to collect firewood, and female commune members to dismantle and wash bedding, renew winter clothes, and dry vegetables and pickle vegetables. At the same time, three repair teams were specially organized to repair kangs (heated brick beds) and plaster walls for commune members. In order to solve the problem of money for seasonal changes, she also discussed with the management area director to issue the regular advance payment to the commune members in advance. She especially cared about the several commune members who had just moved from Shandong. She explained the local climate conditions to each household, introduced cold-proof measures and experiences, and asked the repair team to plaster their houses inside and out twice. Some people's houses were large and not warm, so Xu Zhuqing found someone to partition the large houses into small houses for them.

    Entering winter, what commune members generally care about is the distribution of income from a year's labor. While the autumn harvest was in progress, Xu Zhuqing and the accountant calculated, calculated, and verified the output while harvesting, and cleared up various accounts and announced the work points of commune members. After the autumn harvest was over, she and the cadres and old commune members formulated a distribution plan based on the Party's distribution policy to ensure that more than 90% of the commune members increased their income. Grasping distribution in winter does not mean only grasping it in winter. In the spring, Comrade Xu Zhuqing discussed with the masses and formulated a "three guarantees and one reward" plan that not only ensured increased production compared with the previous year, but also enabled the production team to have output that could be exceeded, and insisted on implementing it. In all production throughout the year, Xu Zhuqing repeatedly emphasized the implementation of work evaluation and score recording. She and the management area director, accountant, and production team's work recorders formulated a table for announcing commune members' daily work points and insisted on evaluating them once a day. And before each season, different labor quotas were formulated according to the characteristics of farm work, and the work point accounts were announced to the commune members once after each farming season. In this way, the commune members' work point accounts are clear, more labor is evaluated with more work points, they know the details in their hearts, and the final settlement is clear at a glance.

    In arranging the lives of commune members, Xu Zhuqing adheres to the Party's policies and at the same time educates commune members to properly handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual. She has consistently educated and persuaded commune members about ideas and behaviors that neglect the interests of the state and the collective, based on the Party's policies. This year, the vegetable acreage in this management area was expanded, and a bumper harvest was achieved. Some people said: "This time, we should eat more and sell less to improve our lives." This is a problem involving the state and the individual, and she decided to convene a meeting of commune members. After calculating the political and economic accounts, the commune members clearly understood that the main thing in supporting socialist construction is to produce grain and various agricultural products, and this is consistent with their long-term interests. As a result, this management area sold more than 200,000 jin of vegetables to the state this year, and they were all top-quality vegetables.

    Managing the Canteen Year-Round
    "Running the canteen well, so that commune members can eat well and eat economically, is the most important thing in the lives of commune members." This is Xu Zhuqing's personal experience in grasping the lives of commune members.

    She truly manages the canteen year-round, working with the canteen manager to jointly plan to improve the diet, and working with the grain manager to jointly control the grain. In the spring, she leads the commune members to grow vegetables and develop household sideline production. In the summer, she focuses on the canteen's sanitation work. In the fall, she leads the commune members to store winter vegetables using various methods such as cellaring, drying, pickling, and preserving. In the winter, she and the commune members established "earthen heating" for the canteen. The busier the farming season, the more deeply and specifically Xu Zhuqing leads the canteen work. She puts on an apron, rolls up her sleeves, and cooks with the cooks.

    One day in late October this year, Xu Zhuqing had just sat down with her meal when commune member Gai Changsuo said to her:
    "Secretary Xu, try it, why is this potato soup and stir-fry sour?" Xu Zhuqing tasted it and it was indeed sour, and she felt very sad: Now is the busy season, how can production be good if the commune members don't eat well! This is all because I haven't gone deep enough in my work. She went to the kitchen and looked for the reason with the cooks. The next day, she personally went to stir-fry the dishes.

    From then on, the canteen's food became more varied, the taste improved, and every commune member praised it and was satisfied.

    In the canteen, she is not only a cook, but also a manager and a propagandist. She helped the canteen establish a menu so that "food and dishes are known in advance"; she helped the canteen plan and save grain, and she also conducted in-depth "look ahead and behind, small stream flows long" education for the canteen staff and commune members, arranged the annual rations for each household and each person, and implemented the method of setting the amount per person and weighing the rice.

    Caring About Pain and Itch
    Recently, there was such an event that was spread among the masses as a good story:

    During the autumn harvest, commune member Che Zengshun developed a sore on his neck. After Xu Zhuqing knew about it, she immediately visited him at his home. Old Che said to her pessimistically: "What should I do! Others say that it is dangerous to have a sore under the neck, if it really... alas, how will my old partner and children live!"

    "Old Che, your illness can definitely be cured, just tell us what difficulties you have, and we can help you solve them." Xu Zhuqing comforted him.

    In order to cure Old Che's illness, Xu Zhuqing called the city hospital to contact them, and then sent him to the city. After Old Che left, she often visited his wife and children, and sent him money and food stamps on time, so that the patient could concentrate on recuperating in the city without any worries. When the mood improves, the illness also gets better quickly. A month later, when he received the doctor's permission to go home, another worry came to his mind: it's getting cold, the windows at home should be repaired, the walls should be plastered, and there is not enough firewood for the winter, but I don't have the strength to do these things now; the secretary has already been meticulous to me, it's really embarrassing to ask for help again.... Old Che walked towards the village with an uneasy mood. But as soon as he walked into the courtyard, his lover greeted him and said happily: "After you left, Secretary Xu often came to ask about everything. Look, the windows have been repaired, the inner and outer walls have been plastered once, and this large pile of firewood will not be burned up in the winter, and the house is warmer than any year...." Old Che's eyes were wet, and he turned around to find Xu Zhuqing and said: "How can I repay the care of the Party and you! I have nothing else, just tell me, I will take out all my strength to do something for everyone."

    In the Xiaosanjiazi Management Area, the deeds of Xu Zhuqing caring about the pain and itch of commune members are everywhere. Which woman is about to give birth, which single household needs to make clothes, when which young person is going to get married... she knows it very clearly and does her best to help.

    Water and Milk Intermingled
    Xu Zhuqing's personal life is not special at all. She always eats at the same table with the commune members, and she never eats an extra bite of "special food." When collecting firewood, she gives the good places to the commune members, and when plastering the walls, she plasters the commune members' walls first.

    Xu Zhuqing cares for and loves the commune members as her own relatives, and the commune members are closer to her than relatives. Women take the initiative to help her make clothes, and old ladies warn her like they would their own daughters to pay attention to her health. Every time she goes to town for a meeting, Xu Zhuqing always asks the commune members if they have anything to do for her, and the commune members also take the initiative to help her pack her luggage and carry things.

    In early October this year, Xu Zhuqing went to the county for a meeting. The commune members of the repair team discussed and decided to plaster Xu Zhuqing's house first. Several "earth tilers" finished plastering it for her, working early and late, and this house was plastered with extra care.

    Grasping life well promotes production. This truth has been most powerfully proven in the Xiaosanjiazi Management Area. The commune members in this management area usually work full time. When pulling the land and cutting the land, the efficiency of the commune members here is higher than elsewhere. The commune members are in a good mood, full of energy, and the labor attendance rate is high, the efficiency is high, which makes the various productions of this management area rank among the best in the entire commune for several years.

    支部书记徐竹青关心群众生活无微不至
    黑龙江爱辉县四嘉子公社小三嘉子管理区党支部书记徐竹青同志，以崇高的阶级情感，无微不至地关心着全体社员的生活。她经常到社员家里，问寒问暖；社员的吃饭、住房、穿衣，一直到婚丧嫁娶、疾病卫生，从老年人到托儿所的孩子，一切的实际生活问题，她都本着党的政策，本着发展生产的原则，认真地帮助安排和解决。她的关怀得到了广大社员真心实意的爱戴，个个都由衷地称赞：“书记比亲人还亲。”
    按季节安排生活
    人们的生活是多方面的、复杂的。徐竹青同志由于多年来坚持参加生产领导生产，与社员同呼吸、共甘苦，因此摸索到一套抓生活的规律，使复杂多样的生活问题，根据需要和可能，既有重点，又能全面照顾地加以合理安排，达到生产生活密切结合，互相促进。这条规律就是：春抓疾病预防，夏抓劳逸结合，秋抓过冬准备，冬抓收益分配，常年抓食堂。
    春天是发病多的季节，徐竹青便把搞好卫生，保证社员身体健康，提到支部工作日程上来。今年春天，她和支部的全体同志带领社员，把全村的环境卫生进行一次彻底整顿。挖了顺水沟，清除了垃圾粪便，新修了厕所，垫平了路基，还抽出两个半劳力，每天负责打扫街道（结合积肥）。每到春季，徐竹青还亲自挨家督促检查，帮助保教人员给托儿所、幼儿园做室内消毒，给孩子们打预防针。人们不生病，这就是春耕生产最有力的保证。
    夏天，天长夜短，生产紧张，人最容易疲乏。徐竹青特别强调劳逸结合，让社员有充足的休息时间。每段生产任务完成时，这个队规定放假一天，她以身作则地利用地头、食堂和干部、社员商量工作，尽量不开大会，就是开会，也是简短明了，说完就干。为了避免社员在田间劳动喝生水，她建议把大锅带到地里，就地给社员烧开水喝。为了使社员在午间休息得好，她带头在地头搭起了凉棚。大家感动地对她说：这样做太好了。在社员中还流传着一首诗：凉棚消暑意，热水暖人心；地头传佳话，党比谁都亲。
    秋天，徐竹青同志总是考虑到提早安排社员过冬生活问题。今年她和队干部们研究，抓住秋收前的有限时间，给社员们放了几天假，组织男社员打柴，女社员拆洗被褥，翻新冬装，晒干菜、腌咸菜。同时专门组织了三个修缮小组，给社员扒炕抹墙。为了解决换季的用钱问题，她还和管理区主任商量，把定期预支提前发给了社员。她特别关心新从山东移来的几户社员，她挨家讲解当地的气候条件，介绍防寒的措施和经验，并让修缮小组把他们的屋子里外抹了两遍。有的人家屋子大，不暖和，徐竹青就找人给他们把大屋子间壁成小屋。
    进入冬季，社员普遍关心的是一年劳动的收益分配问题。徐竹青在秋收进行中，就和会计一起，边收、边算、边核实产量，并清理各种账目，公布社员工分。当秋收结束后，她又同干部、老社员一起，根据党的分配政策，制订出保证90％以上的社员增加收入的分配方案。冬抓分配，并不是进入冬季才抓。徐竹青同志在春天，就和群众商量制订出既保证比上年增产，又使生产队有产可超的“三包一奖”方案，并坚持执行。在全年各项生产中，徐竹青一再强调实行评工记分，她和管理区主任、会计、生产队的记工员，制订了社员当日工分公布表，坚持一日一评。并在各个季节前根据农活特点制出不同的劳动定额，每个农事季节过后，向社员公布一次工分账目。这样，社员工分账目清楚，多劳动多评工，心中有数，年终结算一目了然。
    徐竹青在安排社员生活中，坚持党的政策，同时教育社员处理好国家、集体、个人三者的关系。对一些忽视国家、集体利益的思想和行为，她都坚持党的政策，向社员进行了教育和说服。今年这个管理区蔬菜面积扩大了，并且获得了丰收。有人说：“这回该多吃些，少卖些，好改善生活。”这是个涉及到国家和个人的问题，她决定召开社员大会，经过算政治账、经济账，使社员明确支援社会主义建设主要的是生产粮食和各种农产品，而这是和自己的长远利益一致的。结果这个管理区今年卖给国家二十多万斤蔬菜，而且都是上等菜。
    常年抓食堂
    “搞好食堂，让社员吃得好，吃得省，是社员生活中最重要的事。”这是徐竹青抓社员生活的切身体验。
    她真正做到了常年抓食堂，同食堂管理员共谋改善伙食大计，同粮食管理员共同掌握粮食。春天她领着社员种菜，发展家底生产；夏天大抓食堂卫生工作；秋天又领着社员用窖、晒、腌、渍各种办法贮藏越冬蔬菜；冬天又同社员一起为食堂建立了“土暖气”。越是农忙季节，徐竹青也就越深入而具体地领导食堂工作，她扎上围裙，卷起袖筒，同炊事员一起做饭菜。
    今年10月底的一天，徐竹青端着饭菜刚坐下，社员盖常锁对她说：
  “徐书记，你尝尝，这土豆汤和炒菜怎么酸呢？”徐竹青尝了尝，果真有酸味，心里很难过：现在是大忙时节，社员吃不好，怎么好生产！这都怪自己工作深入不够。她到了伙房，和炊事员一起查找原因。第二天，她亲自去炒菜。
    从这以后，食堂的饭菜花样多了，味道好了，社员个个称赞，人人满意。
    在食堂里，她既是炊事员，又是管理员，又是宣传员。帮助食堂建立了食谱，做到了“饭菜早知道”；帮助食堂计划用粮、节约用粮，并且深入地向食堂人员、社员进行了“瞻前顾后，细水长流”的教育，逐户逐人地安排了全年口粮，实行了按人定量、过秤下米的办法。
    关心痛痒
    最近有这样一件事，被群众传为佳话：
    秋收时，社员车增顺脖子上生了一个疮。徐竹青知道以后，立即登门看望。老车悲观地对她说：“我怎么办啊！别人说脖子底下长疮有危险，如果真……咳，我的老伴和孩子怎样生活啊！”
    “老车，你的病一定能治好，你有什么困难只管提，我们能帮助你解决。”徐竹青安慰他说。
    为了给老车治好病，徐竹青打电话和城里医院联系，又把他送到城里。老车走后，她经常到他家看望他的爱人和孩子，并按时给他捎钱、捎粮票，使病人在城里一心无挂地养病。情绪好起来，病也好得快。一个月后当他得到医生准许回家时，又一桩心事涌上心头：天冷了，家里窗户也该修理了，墙也该抹了，过冬的烧柴还没备足，可这些自己现时还没有力气做；书记对咱已经是无微不至了，再开口请求帮助，真是难为情……。老车心情不安地走向村里。可是刚走进院子，爱人迎出来，高兴地对他说：“你走以后，徐书记常来问长问短。你看，窗户修理了，里外墙都抹了一遍，这一大垛烧柴一冬烧不了，屋子比哪年都暖和……。”老车的眼睛润湿了，他扭转身子就去找徐竹青说：“我怎么报答党和你的关照啊！没别的，你吩咐吧，我要拿出全部的力气，为大伙干点事。”
    在小三嘉子管理区，徐竹青关心社员痛痒的事迹触目皆是。哪个妇女该分娩了，哪个独身户该做衣服了，哪个青年什么时候要结婚，……她都了解得十分清楚，并且尽力给予帮助。
    水乳相融
    徐竹青个人的生活毫不特殊。她始终和社员同桌吃饭，她从不多吃一口“偏饭”。打柴把好场地让给社员，抹墙尽先抹社员的。
    徐竹青把社员当做自己的亲人去关怀、爱护，社员们对她也比亲人还亲。妇女们主动帮她做衣服，老太太像告诫自己亲生女儿一样，让她注意自己的健康。每次上街开会，徐竹青总问社员有什么事代办，而社员也都主动地来帮她捆行李，拿东西。
    今年10月初，徐竹青去县里开会去了。修缮小组的社员们商量决定，先给徐竹青的住房抹墙，几个“土瓦匠”起早贪黑地给她抹完了，这间房子抹得格外的细心。
    抓好生活，促进生产。这个真理在小三嘉子管理区得到最有力的证明。这个管理区社员通常是出满勤，同样拉地、割地，这里社员的效率就比别处高。社员心情舒畅，干劲充沛，劳动出勤率高，效率高，就使得这个管理区的各项生产，几年来都在全公社名列前茅。
