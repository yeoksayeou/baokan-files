Xinhua News Agency report: Shandong Province is strengthening livestock breeding and management to ensure that large livestock can rest and recuperate during the winter and safely overwinter, in order to prepare for the major spring production next year.

This year, Shandong Province had many late autumn crops and heavy "three autumns" tasks. Livestock was used for a long time, and the physical condition of some livestock weakened due to fatigue. In order to enable livestock to quickly gain weight and recuperate, and safely survive the severe winter, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China requested all localities to strengthen livestock winter feeding and management as early as when the autumn harvest and autumn planting had not yet ended. All localities have also listed livestock protection as one of the current important tasks.

All localities have focused on the collection and storage of forage and feed. This year, the forage collected in various places has many varieties and a wide range. Due to the good implementation of various policies, many areas began silage forage during the autumn harvest. After the autumn harvest and autumn planting were basically completed, they seized the opportunity to organize professional teams and mobilize commune members to go to the mountains and lakes to collect plant straw, leaves and vines as winter feed for livestock. Linyi, Changwei, Liaocheng and other three regions, which have made rapid progress in collection and storage, have completed more than 70% of their forage and feed collection and storage plans.

Xinhua News Agency report: Shanxi Province's winter livestock protection work, centered on forage, barn improvement, and fat preservation, has achieved great success.

To date, more than 2.1 billion catties of grass have been cut and stored as green fodder throughout the province. Many people's communes are grasping the storage, management and use of winter forage. Due to early and effective efforts, the problem of grass shortage has been solved in some disaster areas in northern Shanxi.

Since the beginning of winter, various localities have actively carried out livestock barn insulation work. Jin Southeast District and the northern Shanxi Plateau have repaired more than 52,000 livestock barns and built nearly 20,000 new barns. Generally, grass door curtains have been hung in the livestock barns, and wind leakage holes have been blocked. In addition, the winter epidemic prevention work for livestock has been universally strengthened.

After the "three autumns" busy season in the countryside, various localities generally implemented winter rest for livestock and strengthened the leadership of livestock overwintering work. Recently, the agricultural leadership department of Shanxi Province further carried out winter livestock protection inspection activities throughout the province, requiring all communes to ensure that livestock have sufficient grass, are well managed, and well used, that the barns are warm, and that the livestock is fat, per management district.

    山东山西保护牲畜安全过冬
    据新华社讯　山东各地加强牲畜饲养管理，保证大家畜冬休复壮，安全过冬，以迎接明年春季大生产。
    今年山东省晚秋作物多，“三秋”任务重，牲畜使役时间较长，部分牲畜因劳累体质减弱，为了使牲畜迅速增膘复壮，安全度过严冬，中共山东省委早在秋收秋种尚未结束时，就要求各地加强牲畜冬季饲养管理。各地也都把保畜工作列为当前重要任务之一来进行。
    各地突出地抓了收贮饲草饲料工作。今年各地收集的饲草品种多、范围广。由于各种政策贯彻得好，许多地区在秋收时就开始青储饲草。在秋收秋种基本结束后，又抓紧时机组织专业队伍和发动社员上山、下湖，收集植物秸秆叶蔓作为牲畜过冬饲料。收贮进度较快的临沂、昌潍、聊城等三个专区，已完成饲草饲料收贮计划70％以上。
    据新华社讯　山西省各地以饲草、整圈、保膘为中心的冬季保畜工作已经取得很大成就。
    到目前为止，全省已打草贮青二十一亿多斤。许多人民公社都抓紧了过冬饲草的贮备、保管和使用。晋北部分灾区由于抓得早抓得好，缺草问题已经解决。
    入冬以来，各地积极开展了畜圈保温工作。晋东南专区和晋北高原地区已整修了五万二千多间畜圈，还新建了近两万间新圈。一般的畜圈都挂上了草门帘，堵塞了漏风洞。另外，普遍加强了牲畜冬季防疫工作。
    在农村“三秋”大忙之后，各地普遍实行了牲畜冬休，并且加强了对牲畜过冬工作的领导。最近，山西省农业领导部门进一步在全省开展越冬保畜检查活动，要求各公社以管理区为单位作到牲畜草足，保管好，使用好，圈暖，膘满肉肥。（附图片）
