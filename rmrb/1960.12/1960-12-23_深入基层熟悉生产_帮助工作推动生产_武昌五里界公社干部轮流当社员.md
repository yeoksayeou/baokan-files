Going Deep into the Grassroots to Become Familiar with Production, Helping Work and Promoting Production
Wuchang Wulijie Commune Cadres Take Turns Becoming Commune Members

(Our report) In order to meet the requirements of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, the Wulijie People's Commune in Wuchang County, Hubei, has sent cadres from all departments of the commune to production teams in batches and phases to work as commune members in rotation, and some leading core members have been sent to backward teams (or poor teams) to serve as team leaders or deputy team leaders. The time spent as a commune member is generally sixty days per year, or half a month per season; the time spent as a team cadre is limited to changing the backward situation.

After the cadres go to the teams, they go deep into the grassroots, adhere to the "four togethers" (eating, living, working and consulting together), become more familiar with production, understand the situation, and continuously improve their policy level and leadership level. They also directly help the grassroots cadres, promote production, and promote work. For example, Qian Huizhao, a bank cadre from a long-term farmhand background sent by the commune to serve as the deputy team leader of the Ejiabian team of the Hongqi Production Team, put down his luggage and went to work as soon as he arrived at the team, and conscientiously implemented the "four togethers". He quickly discovered the reasons why this team's work was not done well: the team cadres lacked methods and the living arrangements were poor. Combining specific work, he constantly helped the team cadres improve their leadership methods. During the autumn sowing this year, Qian Huizhao worked in the fields with the commune members and found that the sowing quota was too high and the commune members reported that they could not reach it. Based on this situation, Qian Huizhao immediately discussed the reasons and methods for revising the quota with the team leader. After democratic discussion by the commune members, the quota was reasonably revised. Later, Qian Huizhao helped the team to reasonably arrange the use of labor and cattle, and discussed the team's production and living matters with the commune members, mobilizing the enthusiasm of the commune members. As a result, land reclamation and autumn sowing were proactive, and the lives of the commune members were well arranged. It was ranked second in the team's evaluation. During the previous stage of autumn sowing production, the "three guarantees" plan of the Democratic Production Team was not implemented. Wang Caihan, a commune cadre who went to the seventh team of this team to serve as the team leader, mobilized the masses to repeatedly discuss and formulate a production plan for implementation, which stimulated the enthusiasm of the team cadres and commune members to increase production, and quickly organized cattle and labor to invest in grabbing farming and sowing, accelerating the progress of autumn sowing and expanding the area of autumn sowing. The commune party committee promptly introduced the experience of this team, which greatly promoted the autumn sowing production of the entire commune at that time.

The widespread deployment of cadres to the grassroots can promptly identify problems and avoid subjectivism in production leadership. At the beginning of the autumn sowing this year, the commune party committee originally proposed that barley should be strip-sown. This time, Guo Chengbang, deputy secretary of the commune party committee, found in the third team of the Liming Production Team that strip-sowing in paddy fields was uneven and inefficient during labor. Relying on the masses, he summarized five sowing methods suitable for different paddy field characteristics, changing the rigid regulation of strip-sowing in all paddy fields. This not only accelerated the sowing speed and improved the sowing quality, but also expanded the area of wheat planting in paddy fields by nearly twice compared with last year.

In addition, the widespread deployment of cadres to the grassroots has a significant effect on the labor training and ideological transformation of general young cadres, and on all walks of life becoming familiar with agricultural production, understanding production needs, and establishing the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation and serving agriculture in an all-round way. Zhang Shaoquan, deputy secretary of the commune's Communist Youth League committee, rarely participated in labor in the past and did not understand the urgent significance of tool reform. Now, after transporting fertilizer with the commune members, he realized that if the tools are not reformed, people will suffer and the work efficiency will be low. He actively added and repaired five ox carts and ten hand carts together with the team cadres, which not only reduced the labor intensity of the commune members, but also improved the efficiency of fertilizer transportation, which was welcomed by the masses. Qin Zhengbao, director of the production materials retail department of the commune's central store, was sent to the Qunli Team as a commune member during the wheat harvest this year. He worked with the masses to harvest wheat and found that there were no wheat straw ties for bundling wheat, and the masses were anxious. Qin Zhengbao mobilized the office cadres to free up the straw from their bed boards to make more than 700 wheat straw ties, and at the same time purchased more than 50,000 kilograms of rope from other places, which promptly solved the difficulty.

### 深入基层熟悉生产　帮助工作推动生产  武昌五里界公社干部轮流当社员

    深入基层熟悉生产　帮助工作推动生产
    武昌五里界公社干部轮流当社员
    本报讯　为了适应大办农业、大办粮食的要求，湖北武昌县五里界人民公社，把全社各部门的干部，分批分期轮流下放到生产小队当社员，一部分领导骨干下放到落后小队（或穷队）担任小队长或副队长。下放当社员的时间，一般每年是六十天，每季是半个月；下放当小队干部的时间，以改变落后面貌为限。
    干部下放小队后，由于深入基层，坚持贯彻“四同”，更加熟悉生产，了解情况，政策水平和领导水平不断提高，并直接帮助了基层干部，推动了生产，推动了工作。如公社下放的老长工出身的银行干部钱辉照到红旗生产队鄂家边小队担任副队长，他刚到小队就放下行李出工劳动，并认真贯彻“四同”，很快地发现这个小队工作做得不够好的原因：是小队干部缺少办法，生活安排较差等。他结合具体工作，不断地帮助小队干部改进领导方法。今年秋播时，钱辉照在地里和社员一起生产，发现播种定额过高，社员反映达不到。根据这一情况，钱辉照立即同小队长研究出修改定额的理由和办法。经过社员会民主讨论，合理修改了定额。以后，钱辉照又帮助小队合理安排劳动力、耕牛的使用，和社员共同商量全队生产、生活大事，调动了社员的积极性。结果，开荒、秋播事事主动，社员的生活也安排得很好，在全队评比时被列为第二名。前段秋播生产中，民主生产队“三包”计划没有落实，公社干部王才汉到这个队的七小队担任小队长，就发动群众反复讨论，制订出落实的生产规划，激发了小队干部和社员超产积极性，迅速组织耕牛、劳动力投入抢耕抢种，加快了秋播进度，扩大了秋播面积。公社党委及时介绍了这个队的经验，又大大推动了当时全社的秋播生产。
    干部普遍下放基层，能够及时发现问题，避免生产领导中的主观主义。今年秋播开始时，公社党委原提出大麦一律条播。这次公社党委副书记郭成邦在黎明生产队三小队当社员时，和大家在劳动中发现水田条播不匀、工效低等问题，依靠群众总结出适合不同水田特性的五种播种方法，改变了水田一律条播的硬性规定，这样不仅使播种速度加快，提高了播种质量，水田种麦面积还比去年扩大了将近两倍。
    此外，干部普遍下放基层，对一般青年干部劳动锻炼、改造思想和各行各业熟悉农业生产，了解生产需要，树立以农业为基础、全面为农业服务的思想也有显著效果。公社团委副书记张绍全，过去很少参加劳动，不了解工具改革的迫切意义，现在和社员一道送肥后，体会到工具不改革，人受累、工效低，便积极和小队干部一起添修起五辆牛车、十辆手推车，不仅减轻了社员的劳动强度，还提高了送肥工效，受到了群众的欢迎。公社中心商店生产资料门市部主任秦正保，今年麦收时下放到群力队当社员，和群众一起割麦，发现捆麦没有?子，群众焦急。秦正保就动员机关干部腾出床铺草打?子七百多把，同时从外地采购回五万多斤绳子，及时解决了困难。
