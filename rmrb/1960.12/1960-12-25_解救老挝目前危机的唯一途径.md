The Soviet government replied to the British government on December 22 regarding the situation in Laos. In the note, the Soviet government strongly condemned the intervention and aggression of US imperialism and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in Laos; recognized the Souvanna Phouma government as the only legitimate government of the Kingdom of Laos; and called on all peace-loving countries in the world to actively support the Lao government of Phouma. The Soviet government emphasized that the current serious situation in Laos is the result of the blatant interference by US imperialism and certain participating countries in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization military bloc. The Soviet government believes that in order to mediate the Laos issue and normalize the situation in the region, it is necessary to convene a meeting of the participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference to discuss the situation in Laos and to restore the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos. The Soviet government suggested that the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, as chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference, should call on all participating countries of the Geneva Conference to jointly oppose the interference and aggression of US imperialism, to create conditions for maintaining the implementation of the Geneva Accords, and to restore the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos. The Soviet government also suggested working with the British government to request the US government to stop its aid to the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group in Laos, recall US military personnel, recover the arms and weapons the US has transported into Laos, and exert influence on other countries that are providing military personnel and equipment to the rebel group along with the US, and work together to ease the situation in Laos.

The Soviet government's solemn stance on resolving the current Laotian issue and the measures it proposes to take are undoubtedly in line with the interests and aspirations of the Lao people and are conducive to maintaining peace in Indochina and Asia. The Chinese people express their firm support for this.

The Chinese government and the Chinese people have always firmly maintained that the Laos issue should be resolved by the Lao people themselves, and no foreign country should interfere. Our government has stated more than once that the deep-seated root cause and direct cause of the current serious situation in Laos are the rampant interference of US imperialism and its servant, the Thai reactionary authorities, in Laos' internal affairs, and US imperialism's attempt to turn Laos into a US colony and military base. In order to extinguish the flames of war ignited in Laos and stabilize the situation in Laos, we believe that the armed intervention, subversion, and divisive acts of aggression against Laos by US imperialism and its servant Thailand must be stopped immediately, and the sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity of Laos must be respected. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has also repeatedly solemnly declared that the only way to save the current situation in Laos is to stop US imperialism's interference in Laos and allow the Kingdom of Laos to freely embark on the path of peace and neutrality chosen by the Lao people. The positions of the Soviet Union, Vietnam, and China on the Laotian issue are clear and firm. We are all participants in the 1954 Geneva Conference and signatories or guarantors of the Geneva Accords. We have an unshirkable responsibility to jointly maintain the Geneva Accords and restore peace in Laos. We are all socialist countries, sincere and faithful friends of all peoples striving for liberation or who have already freed themselves from imperialist enslavement and oppression, and we have a sacred international obligation to support the struggles of all countries to achieve and consolidate national independence.

The current situation in Laos is very dangerous. US imperialism and its Thai servants and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization are preparing to intervene in Laos on a large scale. US State Department spokesman White openly stated on the 19th that the United States would continue to "fully support" the Vong-Nosavan rebel group and would "give all consideration" to its requests for assistance. White admitted that the United States is colluding with members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, especially Thailand, using Bangkok as a base to airlift so-called "emergency assistance" to the Nosavan rebel group, adding fuel to the fire of the Laotian civil war. At the same time, the US government is stationing troops in the South China Sea, waiting for an opportunity to directly intervene militarily in the Laotian situation. The US Navy Department officially announced on the 15th that "nine units" of the Seventh Fleet are currently deployed in the South China Sea. Two aircraft carriers, several destroyers, and an amphibious force of 1,400 Marines have recently been conducting exercises in the South China Sea to strengthen the "readiness" of these forces. After holding three consecutive "emergency meetings" in Bangkok from the 12th to the 15th, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, controlled by the United States, held another meeting in Bangkok on the 19th to further deploy armed intervention in Laos. While frantically participating in the Laotian civil war, the Thai Sarit reactionary ruling clique also demanded that the United Nations send representatives to Thailand to "investigate" the so-called "losses" it has suffered due to the Laotian civil war; attempting to use the United Nations' signboard to cover up its crimes of interfering in Laos' internal affairs, and conspiring to use this to involve the United Nations in interfering in Laos' internal affairs.

Obviously, if the conspiracies of US imperialism and its servants were to succeed, the flames of war in Laos would inevitably continue to spread, bringing even greater suffering to the Lao people and plunging Indochina and Southeast Asian countries into a crisis of expanding war. At this critical moment, it has become even more necessary to reconvene a meeting of the participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference and restore the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos to seek ways to stop US aggression and safeguard the basic national rights of the Lao people.

The Geneva Accords are the foundation of peace and security in Indochina. Peace in Laos was restored on the basis of the 1954 Geneva Accords on Laos, respecting the sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity of Laos. The Geneva Accords clearly stipulate that Laos shall not join any military bloc, and the entry of foreign military personnel and arms, and military materials into Laos is prohibited, and the establishment of military bases by foreign countries on Laotian territory is prohibited.

For six years, US imperialism, in order to turn Laos into its colony and a base for preparing new wars, has been continuously undermining the Geneva Accords on Laos through its military "aid" and its running dogs in the Lao reactionaries and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. The patriotic and progressive forces of Laos and the broad masses of the Lao people, as well as all peace-loving countries and peoples, have waged repeated and sharp struggles against US imperialism to strive for the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos and to safeguard peace in Laos and Indochina.

At present, the large-scale armed intervention in Laos instigated by US imperialism not only tramples on the sovereignty and independence of Laos, but also seriously threatens peace in the Indochina region and Asia, directly affecting our country's security. The Chinese people cannot but be seriously vigilant about this. We demand the reconvening of a meeting of the participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference and the restoration of the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos in order to seek ways to stop US aggression and create conditions for striving for the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos. We call on all countries and peoples concerned about peace in Indochina to immediately take effective measures and actions to jointly make efforts to maintain the Geneva Accords and restore peace in Laos.

    解救老挝目前危机的唯一途径
    苏联政府12月22日就老挝局势复照英国政府。在照会中，苏联政府强烈谴责了美帝国主义和东南亚条约组织对老挝的干涉和侵略；承认梭发那·富马政府是老挝王国唯一的合法政府；呼吁世界上一切爱好和平的国家积极支持老挝富马政府。苏联政府强调指出，老挝当前的严重局势，是美帝国主义和东南亚条约组织军事集团的某些参加国进行粗暴干涉的结果。苏联政府认为，为了调解老挝问题和使这一地区的局势正常化，有必要召开1954年日内瓦会议参加国的会议来讨论老挝的局势，并且恢复老挝国际监察和监督委员会的活动。苏联政府建议，苏英两国作为1954年日内瓦会议的主席，号召日内瓦会议的所有参加国，共同反对美帝国主义的干涉和侵略，为维护日内瓦协议的实施、为恢复老挝国际监察和监督委员会的活动创造条件。苏联政府并建议同英国政府一起要求美国政府，停止对老挝富米·诺萨万叛乱集团的援助；召回美国军事人员；收回美国运入老挝境内的军火武器以及对其他与美国一道向叛乱集团提供军事人员和装备国的家施加影响，共同为和缓老挝的局势而努力。
    苏联政府对于解决当前老挝问题的严正立场和它建议采取的措施，无疑是符合于老挝人民的利益和愿望，有利于维护印度支那地区和亚洲的和平的。中国人民对此表示坚决支持。
    中国政府和中国人民一贯坚决主张，老挝问题应该由老挝人民自己解决，任何外国不得干涉。我国政府曾不止一次地明确指出，造成老挝当前严重局势的深远根源和直接原因，是美帝国主义和它的仆从泰国反动当局对老挝内政的猖狂干涉，是美帝国主义亟图把老挝变成美国的殖民地和军事基地。为了扑灭在老挝挑起的战火，稳定老挝局势，我们认为，必须立即制止美帝国主义和它的仆从泰国对老挝进行的武装干涉、颠覆和分裂的侵略行为，老挝的主权、独立、统一和领土完整，必须受到尊重。越南民主共和国政府也曾一再郑重声明，挽救老挝当前局势的唯一办法就是：制止美帝国主义对老挝的干涉，让老挝王国自由地走上老挝人民所选择的和平中立的道路。苏联、越南和中国对于老挝问题的立场是明确和坚定的，我们都是1954年日内瓦会议的参加国和日内瓦协议的签字国或保证国，我们有不容推卸的责任，来共同维护日内瓦协议和恢复老挝的和平。我们都是社会主义国家，是为一切争取解放或者已经摆脱了帝国主义奴役和压迫的人民的真诚的和忠实的朋友，我们有神圣的国际义务，支持各国人民争取和巩固民族独立的斗争。
    目前老挝局势非常危险。美帝国主义和它的泰国仆从以及东南亚条约组织正在准备大规模干涉老挝。美国国务院发言人怀特19日公然表示，美国要继续“全力支持”文翁—诺萨万叛乱集团，并且对它提出的援助要求“给予一切的考虑”。怀特供认不讳，美国正纠合东南亚条约组织成员国、特别是泰国，以曼谷为基地，把所谓“紧急援助”空运给诺萨万叛乱集团，为老挝内战火上加油。与此同时，美国政府陈兵南中国海，伺机对老挝局势进行直接的武装干涉。美国海军部15日正式宣布，第七舰队的“九支部队”目前正部署在南中国海上。两艘航空母舰、几艘驱逐舰和一支由一千四百名海军陆战队组成的两栖部队最近一直在南中国海演习，以加强这些部队的“准备状态”。由美国控制的东南亚条约组织在12日到15日期间接连在曼谷召开三次“紧急会议”之后，19日又在曼谷举行会议，进一步部署对老挝的武装干涉。泰国乃沙立反动统治集团在猖狂地参与老挝内战同时，还要求联合国派代表到泰国“调查”它由于老挝内战所遭受的所谓“损失”；企图利用联合国的招牌来掩盖它干涉老挝内政的罪行，并阴谋借此使联合国插手干涉老挝的内政。
    显然，美帝国主义及其仆从的阴谋如果竟然得逞，老挝的战火势必将继续蔓延，为老挝人民带来更加深重的灾难，使印度支那和东南亚各国面临战争扩大的危机。在这个严重的时刻，重新召开1954年日内瓦会议参加国的会议和恢复老挝国际监察和监督委员会的活动，来寻求制止美国侵略、保障老挝人民基本民族权利的办法，就变得更加必要。
    日内瓦协议是印度支那和平与安全的基础。老挝的和平，正是根据1954年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，在尊重老挝主权、独立、统一和领土完整的基础上恢复的。日内瓦协议明白规定，老挝不得加入任何军事集团，禁止外国军事人员和武装、军用物资输入老挝，禁止外国在老挝领土上建立军事基地。
    六年来，美帝国主义为了把老挝变成它的殖民地和准备新战争的基地，一直利用它的军事“援助”和老挝反动派以及东南亚条约组织中的走狗，不断地破坏关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议。老挝爱国进步力量和老挝广大人民，以及所有爱好和平的国家和人民，则为争取日内瓦协议在老挝的实施、为维护老挝和印度支那的和平，同美帝国主义进行了反复的尖锐的斗争。
    目前，美帝国主义策动的对老挝的大规模武装干涉，不仅使老挝的主权和独立遭到蹂躏，而且严重威胁印度支那地区和亚洲的和平，直接影响我国的安全。中国人民对此不能不引起严重的警惕。我们要求重新召开1954年日内瓦会议参加国的会议和恢复老挝国际监察和监督委员会的活动，以便寻求制止美国侵略的办法，为争取日内瓦协议在老挝的实施创造条件。我们呼吁一切关心印度支那和平的国家和人民，立即采取有效措施和行动，为维护日内瓦协议和重新恢复老挝的和平共同作出努力。
