Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 9th: Transport departments and steel mill workers in Hebei are working together to rush pig iron to support steel plant production. In November, the province exceeded its pig iron transfer plan by 4.2%. Entering December, transportation department workers throughout the province have proposed: ensuring that plants do not stock iron, stations do not stop vehicles, and that they will support steel plant production in the final month of this year to achieve a complete victory.

　　In the work of vigorously grasping transportation, all iron smelting plants have strengthened internal transportation work. Highway transport departments have dispatched sufficient cars and horse-drawn carts to short-distance transport, delivering pig iron to the station in a timely manner. The Shuangtashan Iron Plant in Chengde had a narrow road for transporting iron to the station, so they dispatched more than 100 workers to widen the road in three days, and in those three days, they transported all the pig iron stored in the factory. Longyan Iron and Steel Company repaired the plant's dedicated lines, allowing vehicles to enter and exit directly. Now, pig iron is transported as soon as it is produced, transporting as much as is produced.

　　Railway workers in various places have been making every effort to strengthen the organization of transportation, ensuring that pig iron is loaded onto trains as soon as it arrives at the station. All stations have strengthened cooperation with steel plants, proactively understanding the pig iron production situation, grasping the supply of goods, and requesting vehicles from dispatchers in advance. Dispatchers also do everything possible to ensure the supply of empty cars. Zhangjiakou Station consulted with Longyan Iron and Steel Company to unify the dispatch of loading and unloading labor. Wherever there are loading and unloading tasks, they go there, ensuring timely loading and unloading.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, December 9th: Shanxi Province's coal mines, together with railway department workers, are doing everything possible to ensure the completion of the outward transfer of raw coal. From December 1st to 3rd, the average daily coal transported throughout the province increased by 13.3% compared to the last ten days of last month.

　　While increasing the production of raw coal, all mining bureaus are concentrating their efforts on grasping the loading, unloading, and transfer of raw coal, striving to load and transport as much as possible, in order to ensure high yields through increased transport. In the first three days of December, the province dispatched more than 2,800 strong laborers to enrich the loading and unloading front, striving to gather the coking coal and stored coal produced by the mines in a timely manner to the railway and highway trunk lines, so that they can be quickly transported to iron and steel plants. After Yangquan Coal Mine increased the number of workers engaging in coal handling by 500, the daily coal transport volume increased by more than 2,000 tons.

　　In order to ensure sufficient train cars for loading coal, railways, mines, and stations throughout the province are taking effective measures to grasp unloading. Key steel enterprises in the province have generally organized unloading shock teams. Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company alone has organized an unloading team of more than 600 people. Various places are also innovating loading and unloading tools according to local conditions and available materials. In addition to using existing bulldozers and coal chutes for loading and unloading, major coal mines and railways throughout the province are vigorously promoting the mechanization of loading and unloading, reforming transportation lines and transportation organization. The Fenxi Coal Mine has formed a dragon-like mechanized loading and unloading transportation system with manpower, cars, horse-drawn carts, and small flat cars, ensuring that trains are loaded as soon as they arrive, loading as much as they bring, thereby increasing loading and unloading efficiency by one time.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, December 9th: A group of experienced old drivers, shunters, and couplers from Hegang Coal Mine in Heilongjiang Province have returned to the front line of transportation from leadership positions, strengthening the political and technical forces of the front line. Since November, under the difficult conditions of cold waves and falling temperatures, the average daily coal loading volume of the entire mine has still increased by more than 40 cars compared to October.

　　Since late November, the temperature in this area has dropped sharply, with the lowest dropping to minus 26 degrees Celsius. In order to overcome the difficulties brought about by the cold wave and ensure more coal is transported, the Party Committee of the Transportation Department of the Coal Mine decided to send all experienced old drivers, shunters, and couplers among the grassroots leading cadres of the transportation system to the front line of driving. Among the 47 section chiefs, section heads, station masters, and squad leaders who were sent down, 40 were Communist Party members. After returning to the front line, 15 of them served as drivers, and the other 32 also took up their old professions as shunters and couplers. After these old drivers and old workers returned to the front line, they shared hardships with the workers and actively helped them learn the skills of driving in severe cold conditions. After crew leader Lin Baoshan and Chen Shigui returned to the front line as drivers, they helped the original drivers master techniques such as how to go uphill, downhill, and start the car in severe cold conditions, which has gradually eliminated the "slow transportation" accidents where the locomotive could not climb the slope.

　　In the severe cold days, the Party Committee Secretary and Minister of the Transportation Department of Hegang Coal Mine, who had served as drivers and shunters, also squatted on the front line day and night in shifts. Wherever there were difficulties in the marshalling yard, they went there to help. In the more than ten days when the temperature dropped sharply, Yang Sheng, the Party Committee Secretary of the Transportation Department, who was originally a driver, and Guo Jufu, the Minister of the Organization Department of the Party Committee, who was originally an electric locomotive driver, have been sticking to the Dongshan Coal Mine, which has a large transportation volume and steep lines, personally helping the drivers driving the night shift to pass the curves and cross the steep slopes.

　　The Party Committee of the Transportation Department is very concerned about the lives of the workers who persist in coal transportation under severe cold conditions. The Party Committee mobilized the families of the workers to dismantle, wash, and mend more than 200 sets of cotton overalls for these workers, solving the problem of winter clothing for some new workers. In order to ensure that the workers on the front line eat their fill and rest well, warm sheds and stoves for boiling water and heating meals have been built at each loading point, and hot soy milk is also prepared for the night shift workers. The canteen for the front-line workers ensures the supply of hot dishes and hot meals day and night.

    又多又快地把生铁煤焦运进钢厂
    河北运输部门和铁厂通力协作超额完成上月调铁计划
    山西省狠抓煤炭装卸搬运日运量增长百分之十三以上
    鹤岗煤矿老手重上第一线抗住严寒每天多装四十多车煤
    据新华社天津9日电　河北各地运输部门和炼铁厂职工通力协作，赶运生铁支援钢厂生产，11月份全省超额4.2％完成了生铁调运计划。进入12月，全省运输部门职工又提出：保证厂不存铁、站不停车，在今年最后一个月里支援钢厂生产获得全胜。
    在狠抓调运的工作中，各炼铁厂都加强了厂内运输工作。公路运输部门抽调了足够的汽车、马车投入短途运输，及时把生铁运到车站。承德市双塔山铁厂运铁上站的道路窄，他们就抽调一百多名工人，抢修三天加宽了路面，三天时间就把厂存的一批生铁全部运出。龙烟钢铁公司抢修厂内的专用线路，使车辆直出直入，现在已经作到生铁随产随运，产多少，运多少。
    各地铁路职工千方百计加强运输的组织工作，做到生铁到站立即装车。各个车站都加强了同钢铁厂的协作，主动了解生铁生产情况，掌握货源，提前向调度员请求车辆；调度员也千方百计保证供应空车。张家口车站同龙烟钢铁公司协商，统一调度装卸劳力，那里有装卸任务就到那里去，保证了及时装卸。
    据新华社太原9日电　山西省各煤矿同铁路部门职工一起，千方百计保证完成原煤外调任务。12月1日至3日，全省每天运的煤炭平均比上月下旬提高13.3％。
    各个矿务局在增产原煤的同时，都集中力量狠抓原煤的装卸调运，尽量做到多装多运，以多运保高产。在12月份的头三天，全省抽调二千八百多名强壮劳力，充实装卸搬运战线，力争把矿井增产的焦煤和存煤及时汇集到铁路和公路干线上，以便迅速运到炼铁厂和炼钢厂。阳泉煤矿增加了五百人大搞捣搬煤以后，每天运煤量增加两千吨以上。
    为了保证有足够的车皮装煤，全省路、矿、车站都采取有力措施抓好卸车。省内各重点钢铁企业普遍组织卸车突击队，仅太原钢铁公司就组织了六百多人的卸车队。各地还因地制宜、就地取材地革新装卸工具。全省各大煤矿、铁路，除运用现有的推土机、煤溜子等装卸机械外，正在大搞装卸土机械化，改革运输线路和运输组织。汾西煤矿把人力、汽车、马车、小平车等组成一条龙的装卸土机械化运输，保证了火车随到随装，来多少装多少，使装卸效率提高一倍。
    据新华社哈尔滨9日电　黑龙江省鹤岗煤矿一批有经验的老司机、调车员、联结员，从领导岗位上回到运输第一线，加强了第一线的政治力量和技术力量。11月以来，全矿在寒潮侵袭、气温下降的困难条件下，煤炭平均日装车量仍比10月份增加四十多车。
    11月下旬以来，这个地区的气温骤然下降，最低降到摄氏零下二十六度。煤矿运输部党委为了克服寒潮带来的困难，保证多运煤炭，决定把运输系统的基层领导干部中有经验的老司机、调车员、联结员，全部下放到行车第一线去。下放的四十七名科长、段长、站长、班长等干部中，有四十名是共产党员。他们回到第一线后，有十五名充当了司机，另外三十二名也干起了调车员、联结员等老本行。这些老司机、老工人回到第一线后，同工人们一起同甘共苦，积极帮助他们学习在严寒条件下行车的本领。乘务班长林宝山、陈士贵重回第一线当了司机后，帮助原来的司机掌握在严寒条件下如何上坡、下坡、起车等技术，已使原来的司机逐步消灭了机车爬不上坡的“运缓”事故。
    在严寒的日子里，鹤岗煤矿运输部党委书记、部长中当过司机和调车员的领导干部，也都昼夜轮班蹲在第一线。在调车场上，那里有困难，他们就到那里去帮忙。在气温骤降的十多天里，老司机出身的运输部党委书记杨生同原是电气机车司机的党委组织部长郭巨福一起，一直坚守在运量大、线路陡的东山煤矿，亲自帮助夜班行车的司机驶过弯道，越过陡坡。
    运输部党委十分关心在严寒条件下坚持煤炭运输的职工的生活。党委发动职工家属为这些职工拆洗、缝补了两百多套棉作业服，解决了一部分新工人的冬季御寒服装问题。为了保证第一线职工吃得饱，休息得好，各装车点都修建了暖棚和烧水、热饭的炉灶，还为夜班工人准备了热豆浆。行车第一线的职工食堂，做到了昼夜供应热菜，热饭。
