	Repairing Lines in the Snow
	Despite wearing a coat, cotton shoes, a cotton hat, and gloves, the north wind carrying snowflakes was still piercingly cold. Wang Yutian, a worker from the Shenyang Electric Power Bureau's Distribution Work Zone, braved the cold wind, climbed onto the utility pole using foot buckles, and installed a transformer. When his hands became numb with cold, he would rub them together, then continue working.

	When he came down from the utility pole, someone asked him if he was cold. He said, "Our revolutionary predecessors climbed snow-covered mountains and crossed grasslands for the cause of the Party. Today, for the sake of socialist construction, for safe power transmission, and to guarantee production and the people's livelihood, what does this bit of cold matter?" As he spoke, he picked up his tools and continued down the circuit, continuing the repair work. (Attached picture)

    冒雪检修线路
    尽管穿着大衣、棉鞋，戴着棉帽、手套，然而夹着雪花的北风，吹过来还是透骨寒。沈阳电业局配电工区工人王雨田，冒着寒风，蹬上脚扣，爬上电线杆，安装变压器。手冻木了，他就搓一搓，接着再干。
    当他从电线杆子上下来时，有人问他冷不冷，他说：“我们的革命前辈为了党的事业爬雪山过草地，今天我们为了社会主义建设，为了安全送电，保证生产和人民生活，这点冷算得了什么。”说着，拿起工具，又顺着电路走下去，继续进行检修。（附图片）
