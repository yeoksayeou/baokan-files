Local Newspaper Commentary Excerpts:

    The production and repair of farm tools must be closely integrated. Repair work, like manufacturing, is an indispensable and important link in developing agricultural production and gradually realizing agricultural mechanization. Where there is manufacturing, there must be repair. Repair work is essential at all times. In the work of repairing and manufacturing farm tools, we must pay attention to machines, but we cannot ignore red furnaces. Red furnaces have many unique advantages; they can forge and hammer; they can repair and manufacture; they can do both fixed repairs and mobile repairs in rural areas.
    In order to do a good job in the repair and assembly of agricultural machinery, we must adopt various methods convenient to the masses, combining the organization of red furnaces to go to the countryside for mobile repair with the zoning and fixed-point overhaul, vigorously carry out repair activities, and gradually establish and improve the farm tool repair network in a planned and led manner. The method of "commune helping team," that is, transferring a portion of iron and woodworkers from commune-run industries to production teams, combined with the repair forces selected by the teams, to universally establish farm tool repair stations in production teams, has many benefits. First, the repair stations of production teams can undertake all the repair of small farm tools and part of the manufacturing tasks, so that the commune farm tool factory can concentrate its main force on producing larger and more complex farm tools and overhauling agricultural machinery. Second, after the production team establishes a repair station, generally damaged farm tools can be repaired locally. This can save the time of going to the commune farm tool factory for repair. Third, after the production team establishes a repair station, daily necessities and small furniture can also be repaired and supplemented in time. In addition, the repair station can also help production teams and commune members establish and improve various systems for the use, storage, maintenance, and overhaul of farm tools.

    组织红炉下乡　抓紧修配农具
    农具的生产和修配，必须紧密结合。修配工作和制造一样，是发展农业生产和逐步实现农业机械化的不可缺少的重要环节，有制造就要有修配，修配工作在任何时候都是不可缺少的。在修制农具的工作中，要重视机器，也不能忽视红炉。红炉具有许多独特的优点，它既能打，又能锻；既能修，又能造；既能固定修配，又能串乡巡回修配。
    为了搞好农业机具的修配工作，必须采取各种便利群众的方法，组织红炉下乡巡回修配和划片定点检修相结合，大力开展修配活动，并且有计划、有领导地把农具修配网逐步建立和健全起来。采取社帮队的办法，从社办工业抽调一部分铁、木工人下放到生产队，结合队里选拔的修配力量，在生产队普遍建立农具修配站，有许多好处。首先，生产队的修配站可以承担全部小农具的修配和部分小农具的制造任务，使公社农具厂可以集中主要力量生产比较大的、复杂的农具和检修农业机械。其次，生产队建立修配站以后，一般农具损坏了可以就地修理。这样可以节约到公社农具厂修配的时间。第三，生产队建立修配站以后，日常生活必需品和小家具也可以及时修理补充。另外，修配站还可以帮生产队和社员，建立和健全各种农具的使用、保管、维护检修等制度。
