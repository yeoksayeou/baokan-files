    Going Deep Reveals Problems
    Promoting work by inspecting the implementation of the Party's policies is the main working method of Comrade Wu Qinglong, the first secretary of our commune's Party committee. Wherever he goes, he always first understands the implementation of the Party's policies. Recently, when he went to the Huling Production Team to inspect work, the secretary of the production team's Party branch reported that the production team's "three guarantees" had been fully implemented. After he went deep into the masses to understand the situation, he found that although the contracted production plans had been implemented in the fields, they had not been discussed by the commune members; the systems of contracted labor, contracted costs, and rewards and penalties had not been fully implemented. He and the branch members of the production team studied together, explaining that whether the Party's policies are implemented well depends on whether the commune members' ideological awareness and labor enthusiasm have been improved. If the commune members have not discussed the "three guarantees and one reward" in depth and they have not been fully implemented, then it is necessary to mobilize the commune members to discuss them again and fully implement them. According to Secretary Wu's opinion, the production team's Party branch organized the commune members to discuss the relationship between vigorously developing agriculture and the "three guarantees and one reward," so that the commune members realized that actively doing a good job in the "three guarantees" is a concrete action for vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain production. Each production team also checked the implementation of the three guarantees item by item, and launched production competitions exceeding the guaranteed production targets, focusing on weak links. In the inspection, the Yangli Production Team found that the fertilizer was insufficient according to the "three guarantees" plan, so they organized labor to smoke and produce fertilizer. Hu Tongji, a commune member of the Cunwei Production Team, knew that the base fertilizer for summer crops was insufficient, so he actively accumulated and produced fertilizer. He accumulated 380 dan of boiled saltpeter mud and gave it to the production team to apply topdressing fertilizer to the wheat fields. He said with confidence: "If the wheat fields are given enough fertilizer and carefully managed, we will definitely be able to exceed the guaranteed production in the summer harvest next year."

    深入下去就能发现问题
    通过检查党的方针政策贯彻执行的情况推动工作，是我们公社党委第一书记吴清隆同志主要的工作方法。他走到哪里，总是首先了解贯彻执行党的政策的情况。最近，他到胡岭生产队检查工作时，生产队党支部书记汇报说，生产队的“三包”已经全部落实。他深入群众了解以后，发现包产计划虽然落实到田，但是并没有发动社员讨论过；包工、包成本和奖罚制度还没有完全落实。他就和生产队的支部委员一起研究，说明党的政策贯彻执行得好不好，要看社员的思想觉悟和劳动积极性是不是提高了，社员对“三包一奖”讨论得不深，没有全部落实，就要发动社员重新讨论，全面落实。生产队党支部根据吴书记的意见，就组织社员讨论了大办农业与“三包一奖”的关系，使社员认识到积极搞好“三包”，就是大办农业、大办粮食的具体行动。各生产小队也逐项检查了三包落实情况，针对薄弱环节开展了超包产的生产竞赛。洋理生产小队在检查中，发现按着“三包”计划肥料还不足，就组织劳力熏制肥料。村尾生产小队的社员胡桐基，知道夏收作物底肥不足，就积极积肥造肥，他积下了三百八十担煎硝泥，交给生产小队给麦田施了追肥。他满有信心地说：“麦田施足了肥，再加上精心管理，明年夏收一定能够超包产。”
