Xinhua News Agency, December 9th: The declaration of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties continues to elicit enthusiastic responses from people across China. In cities such as Harbin, Changchun, Taiyuan, Hohhot, Urumqi, Yinchuan, Xining, Lhasa, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Changsha, Zhengzhou, Guiyang, Kunming, Nanning, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Jinan, Hefei, Fuzhou, and Nanchang, the broad masses of working people and other strata of society have continued to hold numerous symposiums in recent days, expressing their firm support for this declaration and their determination to strive to realize the tasks put forward in the declaration.

Workers, peasants, and people from all walks of life believe that this declaration is another revolutionary document of great historical significance since the publication of the 1957 Moscow Declaration. Chen Yu, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, said that this declaration is a victorious banner of the world communist movement and the workers' movement, and a banner of unity for the Communist parties of all countries, the international proletariat, and the socialist camp. Our working class firmly supports this declaration and is determined to respond to the great call made in the declaration with practical actions. Qi Shenglin, an advanced producer in Qinghai Province, said that this declaration will undoubtedly play a significant mobilizing role for all communists and all peace-loving people in the world. Li Shunda, a well-known national agricultural labor model, said that the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries was a meeting of unity and a meeting of victory. The documents of the meeting severely struck at imperialism and inspired all peace-loving people in the world. Lü Jiyi, Deputy Director of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said that the declaration pointed out the main characteristics of our era, summarized the rich experience of the world people's revolutionary struggle movement over the past few years, and determined the direction and common tasks of future struggles, enabling us to further understand the situation, clarify the direction, and strengthen our confidence.

The further unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, as demonstrated in the declaration, makes people from all walks of life in our country feel happy and encouraged. They pointed out that unity is strength, and unity is victory. The Chinese people will, as in the past, strive to continuously strengthen the great unity of the Chinese and Soviet parties, countries, the entire socialist camp, and the entire international communist movement. Ma Lizhen, a famous advanced producer from the Jinan No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, who recently returned from a visit to the Soviet Union, said that imperialism, in order to pursue its policy of aggression, is most afraid of the unity between China and the Soviet Union, so they try every possible means to vainly attempt to destroy the close friendship between the two countries. The declaration of this meeting completely shattered the shameless delusions of imperialism. Deng Xiaolan, a famous actor from Jiangxi Province who recently returned from a trip to the Soviet Union, said that from the declaration, people can clearly see that the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet parties and countries is based on common ideals, common causes, and the common interests of the people of the whole world, and it is eternal and unbreakable. The Chinese people will never forget the brotherly and selfless assistance of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet people to our revolutionary cause and socialist construction. Rong Xi, a Mongolian female worker and advanced producer from the Inner Mongolia No. 1 Woolen Textile Factory, and Hu Xiuying, a Hui female worker and national advanced producer from the Hohhot Mica Factory, said that the declaration of the meeting of representatives of eighty-one Communist and Workers' Parties is itself sufficient to prove that the unity of the brother parties of all countries in the world is unbreakable. Wang Changming, director of the Hangzhou Silk Printing and Dyeing Factory and a famous labor model, said that the unity of the Chinese and Soviet parties and countries is the cornerstone of the unity of the socialist camp, the international communist movement, and the people of the whole world. We will work together with the Soviet workers to further strengthen this great unity. The workers of many factories, such as the Changchun No. 1 Automobile Manufacturing Plant, expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet people for the tremendous assistance they have given to our country's socialist construction, and expressed their desire to further study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and accelerate our country's socialist construction.

The declaration pointed out that the danger of imperialism launching a new world war has not passed, and it is now more necessary than ever for the people of all countries to maintain a particularly high degree of vigilance; at the same time, it pointed out that as long as the people of all countries strengthen their unity and struggle, they can prevent a new world war. This conclusion has been endorsed by the people of all regions. Yang Deyan (Bouyei nationality), a labor model in Guizhou Province and an engineer from the Ganyintang Steel Plant, said that the declaration pointed out that the nature of imperialism will not change, and as long as imperialism exists, there will be soil for aggressive war. This point is particularly deeply felt by the Chinese people, who have suffered from imperialist bullying. We must maintain a high degree of vigilance against the war conspiracies of US imperialism. Ou Yanmin and Li Yunhua, advanced producers from the Xinghuacun Vegetable Brigade of the Miaojie Branch of the Xishi People's Commune in Hefei City, said that the current world situation is as stated in the declaration: the socialist forces significantly exceed the imperialist forces, and the forces of peace significantly exceed the forces of war. As long as the peace-loving people of the world further unite and actively struggle, defeat the aggressive and war policies of US imperialism, it is possible to prevent a new world war. Zhong Zhigang, a famous advanced producer and worker at the Chengdu Measuring Tools and Cutting Tools Factory, expressed his determination to increase production and strengthen the strength of our country's socialist construction with his practical actions to defend world peace. Chu Futian, a commander of an airport on the Fujian front line of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and a first-class meritorious person, said that we resolutely respond to the call of the declaration, maintain a high degree of vigilance at all times, and fight to the end to defend world peace and prevent the new world war planned by the US imperialist aggressive group. Deng Baoshan, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and Li Hanyuan, Vice Chairman, pointed out after reading the declaration that the nature of imperialism will never change, and we must strengthen the struggle against imperialism to defend world peace.

People from all walks of life warmly support the declaration's profound analysis of the national independence movement in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the struggle of the people of various capitalist countries for world peace, democratic freedom, and socialism, and expressed their firm support for the just struggle of the people of these countries. Wei Shuqin, a salesperson and labor model at the Harbin No. 7 Department Store, said that the Chinese people have always firmly supported the struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against colonialism. Wang Jinlu, Deputy Director of the Islamic Association of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, said that the current international situation is very favorable to the struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America for national independence. We Muslims admire their heroic struggle and firmly support them in achieving final victory.

People from all regions also expressed that the publication of this declaration is the beginning of a new common struggle, and the Chinese people will, as always, resolutely follow the consensus reached by the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries and strive to achieve the goals of the struggle stipulated in this document. Li Siwei, an old party member who has been the party branch secretary of the Huangjialing Management Area of the Nanzhuang Commune in Lüliang County, Shanxi Province, for twelve years, said: Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have always taught us to be loyal to Marxism-Leninism and loyal to the international communist movement. We have done this in the past, and we will continue to do so in the future. The signing of the new common document is the beginning of a new common struggle. The Chinese Communists will, as in the past, wage unremitting struggles to defend world peace, strive for national liberation, democratic freedom, and the victory of the cause of socialism.

    全国各地人民拥护各国共产党和工人党代表会议声明
    据新华社9日讯　各国共产党和工人党代表会议声明继续引起我国各地人民的热烈反应。哈尔滨、长春、太原、呼和浩特、乌鲁木齐、银川、西宁、拉萨、兰州、成都、长沙、郑州、贵阳、昆明、南宁、南京、杭州、济南、合肥、福州、南昌等地的广大劳动人民和其他各阶层人民，这几天继续举行了许多座谈会，表示坚决拥护这一声明，并且决心为实现声明所提出的任务而奋斗。
    各地的工人、农民和各阶层人民认为，这个声明是1957年莫斯科会议宣言发表以后另一个具有重大历史意义的革命文献。湖南省总工会主席陈郁发说，这个声明是世界共产主义运动和工人运动的胜利旗帜，是各国共产党、国际无产阶级、社会主义阵营团结的旗帜。我们工人阶级坚决拥护这个声明，并决心以实际行动来响应声明中所提出的伟大号召。青海省工业先进生产者祁生林说，这个声明对于全世界共产党人和一切爱好和平的人民，毫无疑问将发挥重大的动员作用。全国著名的农业劳动模范李顺达说，各国共产党和工人党代表会议是一次团结的大会、胜利的大会，会议发表的文件沉重地打击了帝国主义，鼓舞了全世界爱好和平的人民。民革广西僮族自治区委员会副主任委员吕集义说，声明指出了我们时代的主要特征，总结了几年来世界人民革命斗争运动的丰富经验，决定了今后斗争的方向和共同的任务，使我们进一步认清了形势，明确了方向，增强了信心。
    声明所显示的各国共产党和工人党在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的进一步团结，使我国各阶层人民感到欢欣鼓舞。他们指出，团结就是力量，团结就是胜利。中国人民将和过去一样，为不断加强中苏两党、两国和整个社会主义阵营、整个国际共产主义运动的伟大团结而努力。济南第一机床厂的著名先进生产者马丽珍不久前才从苏联访问回来，她说，帝国主义要推行侵略政策，最怕中苏两国的团结，所以它们千方百计妄想破坏中苏两国之间的亲密友谊。这次会议的声明彻底粉碎了帝国主义的无耻妄想。最近才从苏联旅行回来的江西省著名演员邓筱兰说，从声明中，人们都清楚地看到中苏两党、两国间的友谊是建立在共同理想、共同事业和全世界人民共同利益上的，是永恒的、牢不可破的。苏联共产党和人民对我国革命事业和社会主义建设事业中兄弟般无私的援助，中国人民永远也不会忘记。内蒙古第一毛纺织厂蒙古族女工、先进生产者容喜和呼和浩特市云母厂回族女工、全国先进生产者虎秀英说，八十一个共产党和工人党代表会议的声明本身，就足以证明世界各国兄弟党的团结是牢不可破的。杭州丝绸印染厂厂长、著名的劳动模范王长明说，中苏两党、两国的团结，是社会主义阵营、国际共产主义运动和全世界人民团结的基石。我们将同苏联工人一起共同努力，进一步加强这一伟大团结。长春第一汽车制造厂等许多工厂的职工表示衷心感谢苏联人民对我国社会主义建设所给予的巨大援助，并表示要进一步学习苏联的先进经验，加快我国的社会主义建设。
    声明指出帝国主义发动新的世界大战的危险还没有过去，现在比任何时候都更要求各国人民保持特别高的警惕；同时指出，只要各国人民加强团结和斗争，就能够防止新的世界大战。这一论断受到各地人民的赞同。贵州省劳动模范、甘荫塘钢厂工人出身的工程师杨德炎
  （布依族）说，声明指出帝国主义的本性不会改变，只要帝国主义还存在，就有侵略战争的土壤。这一点对饱受过帝国主义欺凌的中国人民来说，是体会得特别深刻的。我们对美帝国主义的战争阴谋必须保持高度的警惕。合肥市西市人民公社庙街分社杏花村蔬菜大队的先进生产者欧延敏、李云华等人说，现在的世界形势正如声明中所说的，社会主义力量更加显著地超过帝国主义力量，和平力量更加显著地超过战争力量。只要全世界爱好和平的人民进一步团结起来，积极进行斗争，击败美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，就有可能防止新的世界大战。著名的先进生产者、成都量具刃具厂工人钟志刚表示以自己的实际行动，增加生产，增强我国社会主义建设的力量，来保卫世界和平。中国人民解放军福建前线某机场指挥员、一等功臣褚福田说，我们坚决响应声明的号召，时时刻刻保持高度警惕，为维护世界和平，防止美帝国主义侵略集团所策划着的新世界战争而斗争到底。民革甘肃省委员会主任委员邓宝珊和副主任委员李翰园在阅读了这一声明后指出，帝国主义本性决不会改变，我们要加强对帝国主义的斗争，以保卫世界和平。
    各地人民热烈拥护声明中对亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族独立运动和各资本主义国家人民争取世界和平、民主自由和社会主义斗争形势的深刻分析，并表示坚决支持这些国家人民的正义斗争。哈尔滨市第七百货商店售货员、劳动模范魏淑琴说，中国人民一贯坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民反对殖民主义的斗争。宁夏回族自治区伊斯兰教协会副主任王进禄说，目前国际形势对亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民争取民族独立的斗争非常有利，我们穆斯林对他们的英勇斗争表示钦佩，并且坚决支持他们获得最后胜利。
    各地人民还表示，这一声明的发表是新的共同斗争的开始，中国人民将一如既往，坚决遵循各国共产党和工人党达成的一致协议，并且为实现这一文件所规定的斗争目标而奋斗。山西省吕梁县南庄公社黄家岭管理区已经担任了十二年党支部书记的老党员李四维说：毛主席和党中央一贯教导我们忠于马克思列宁主义，忠于国际共产主义运动，我们过去这样做了，今后还将这样做，新的共同文件的签署，是新的共同斗争的开始，中国共产党人将和过去一样，为保卫世界和平、争取民族解放、民主自由和社会主义事业的胜利而进行不懈的斗争。
