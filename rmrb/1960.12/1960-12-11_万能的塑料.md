    The Almighty Plastic

  The transparent, translucent, hard, and soft soap boxes, "glass" toothbrushes, socks, handbag baskets, "chemical" kettles, baby bottles, buttons, combs, teacups, and all kinds of shiny and beautiful fountain pen barrels, as well as bakelite and other items that we commonly see in our daily lives are all made of plastic. Plastics are some high molecular organic synthetic materials. Currently, there are about a hundred members of the plastic family, with two or thirty kinds being common. Because their properties are different, their uses are also different.
    Some plastics can replace metal materials. For example, machine gears made of phenolic resin laminated plastic are as wear-resistant as steel, but there is no friction noise when they are running. As everyone knows, metal materials such as steel are most afraid of corrosion from acids and alkalis, which is also a headache for people. However, since many new plastic varieties have continued to appear, this problem has been initially solved. Polyvinyl chloride and fiberglass are both excellent chemical corrosion-resistant materials. Even "aqua regia," which gold fears, is helpless against polytetrafluoroethylene. Therefore, people call polytetrafluoroethylene the "king of plastics." Plastic is also an ideal insulating material. It not only does not absorb water or moisture, but it is also not easy to conduct electricity. Almost all electrical products cannot do without it.
    "Three days of fishing and two days of drying nets" was originally a satirical cliché, but it is common for fishermen to dry their nets because fishing nets become weak and easily mildew after being soaked in water for a long time. However, fishing nets woven from chlorinated ethylene or nylon (Kapron), nylon, etc., are not only stronger and more resistant to seawater erosion than fishing nets woven from ordinary plant fibers and do not mildew, but also eliminate the trouble of drying nets. In wood processing, shavings and sawdust are inevitable waste materials. In the past, they could only be used as fuel. Now, shavings and wood scraps can be glued together to make beautiful furniture, turning waste into treasure. This is also thanks to urea-formaldehyde resin!
    In addition to being commonly used as tablecloths, raincoats, curtains, toothbrush bags, etc., polyvinyl chloride film can also be used in agricultural production to prevent frost, cold, and greenhouse vegetable production. Artificial leather made of polyvinyl chloride is a leather substitute for making leather jackets, suitcases, leather shoes, handbags, and other items. One ton of artificial leather made of polyvinyl chloride, if made into shoe uppers, is equivalent to the use of 20,000 cowhides.
    Some plastics have the strength of steel but are as light as wood, some are as transparent as glass but as soft as rubber, and some are as corrosion-resistant as lead but have very high insulation properties. Plastic can not only be processed by pressurization, but also by various methods such as casting, spinning, grinding, cutting, welding, and bonding. Therefore, some people call plastic a metal "substitute." In fact, plastic is no longer a "substitute," but an indispensable material for cutting-edge science, national defense, modern industry, agriculture, cultural education, and making people's daily lives more colorful.

    万能的塑料
    何秉朴
  我们日常生活中常见的那些透明、半透明、硬的、软的肥皂盒，“玻璃”牙刷、袜子、皮包提篮，“化学”水壶、奶瓶、扣子、梳子、茶杯和各种光亮美丽的自来水笔笔杆以及电木等一些东西，都是塑料制成的。塑料是一些高分子的有机合成材料。目前塑料家族的成员大约上百个，常见的也有二、三十种，由于它们秉性不同，用途也不一样。
    有些塑料能够代替金属材料。像用酚醛胶布层压塑料压成的机器齿轮，虽然像钢那么耐磨，可是开动起来却没有一点摩擦的响声。大家都知道，钢铁等金属材料最怕的是酸、碱化学物品的腐蚀，这也是使人们很伤脑筋的，但自从许多新塑料品种不断出现后，已经初步解决了这样的问题，像聚氯乙烯、玻璃钢都是很好的耐化学腐蚀材料。就连黄金都怕的“王水”，但对聚四氟乙烯来说却无可奈何，因此，人们称聚四氟乙烯为“塑料王”。塑料也是理想的绝缘材料，它不仅不吸水不吸潮，还不易导电，几乎所有电器制品中都少不了它。
    “三天打鱼、两天晒网”，这原是一个讽刺的口头禅，不过打鱼人晒网确是常事，因为鱼网在水里泡久了不结实，容易霉烂，但是用过氯乙烯或锦纶（卡普纶）、尼纶等抽丝织成的鱼网，不仅比一般植物纤维编织的鱼网结实、耐海水的浸蚀，不霉烂，更没有晒网的麻烦了。在木材加工时，刨花和木屑是必然产生的废料，过去只能做为燃料，现在能把刨花、碎木粘在一起，做成漂亮的家具，使废物变成宝物，这还得要归功于脲醛树脂呢！
    聚氯乙烯薄膜除了常用做桌布、雨衣、窗帘、牙具袋等外，在农业生产上还可用来防霜、防寒以及温室蔬菜生产等。聚氯乙烯做的人造皮革是做皮夹克、皮箱、皮鞋、手提包等用品的皮革代用材料。一吨聚氯乙烯做成的人造皮革如果做成鞋面，就相当于两万张牛皮的用途。
    塑料有的强度像钢，可是却像木材那么轻，有的像玻璃一样透明，可是像胶皮那么柔软，有的像铅那么耐腐蚀，但是绝缘性能却很高。塑料不仅能采用加压的办法，而且可以用铸型、旋、磨、切削、焊接和粘接等各种各样的办法来加工。因此，有人把塑料叫做金属的
  “代用品”。其实，塑料早已不是什么“代用品”，而是尖端科学，国防、现代工业、农业和文化教育，以及使人民日常生活更加绚丽多彩所必不可少的材料了。
