Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 8th. The Polish "People's Tribune" published an editorial on December 7th entitled "The Voice of the Communists," pointing out that the meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties in Moscow "enriched the basic guidelines of the international communist movement with new experiences and new tasks."

The editorial said, "What determines the characteristics of our era is the struggle between two opposing social systems—socialism and capitalism. The transition of mankind from capitalism to socialism, which began with the October Revolution, is vigorously developing—socialist revolution, national liberation revolution, and the class struggle in capitalist countries are destroying and shrinking the positions of imperialism. The world socialist system is becoming a decisive factor in human development." The most essential prerequisite for this is the rapid development of socialist countries.

It said, "In the capitalist world, the contradiction between productive forces and relations of production is becoming increasingly acute. Imperialist monopoly capital is increasingly combined with the reactionary state machinery, controlling all aspects of life." "The anarchy of the capitalist economy has caused its economic fluctuations and deepened the capitalist contradictions at home and abroad." "The strengthening of the national liberation struggle, the anti-war struggle, and the class struggle in the modern world is a sign of a new stage in the development of the general crisis of capitalism."

When discussing the issue of war and peace, the editorial said that capitalism does not produce peace but produces war. Imperialism and its allies – the major imperialist countries – have established a system of military blocs and military bases, imposing a mad arms race on the world. The revival of West German militarism is a clear manifestation of these trends.

However, the period when the fate of peace was determined by the will of the imperialists is gone forever. A broad front for defending peace can prevent new wars. Therefore, it is necessary to establish and consolidate this front in order to focus the struggle for peace on the most urgent tasks today, which are: stopping the arms race, banning atomic weapons, banning the testing and production of such weapons, abolishing foreign military bases and withdrawing foreign troops from other countries' territories, disbanding military blocs, concluding a peace treaty with Germany and turning West Berlin into a demilitarized free city, and crushing the actions of West German and Japanese militarists and revanchists.

The editorial said that Communists resolutely advocate peaceful coexistence, mobilize the people of all countries to fight for peaceful cooperation, and call for active action to defend peace.

The editorial said, "Peaceful coexistence does not mean abandoning the class struggle in the slightest. Coexistence is a form of this struggle."

The editorial pointed out, "At present, eliminating colonialism first requires fighting against all forms of neo-colonialism, which attempt to maintain the economic status of the colonial powers in the liberated countries, drag them into military blocs, establish military dictatorships or puppet governments there, and paralyze the national liberation struggle by provoking ethnic conflicts and disputes."

The editorial pointed out that the full utilization of the tremendous revolutionary possibilities existing in the current era depends on the Communists, on the unity and strength of all Communist Parties, and on their international solidarity and unity.

The editorial said that revisionism remains the main danger, as it castrates the revolutionary content of Marxism-Leninism and disarms the working masses. Dogmatism and sectarianism, if not resolutely combated, may also become the main danger of this or that party, making it unable to carry out effective activities under changed conditions.

The editorial talked about how close international unity is of particular importance today. The editorial said that the situation and tasks stipulate the importance of the unity of the Soviet Communist Party and the Chinese Communist Party, the two largest parties, and the unity of socialist countries and communist and workers' parties around the world.

The editorial said that all our parties are independent, equal, follow the general principles of Leninism, determine their own policies according to the needs of their own countries, and support each other based on internationalist ideas. In the international communist movement, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the universally recognized vanguard, and it is the most experienced and most seasoned force.

The editorial said that the Polish United Workers' Party stands on the basis of the unshakable unity of the socialist camp and the entire international workers' movement, and has consistently followed the Leninist guidelines of the Moscow Declaration. We regard this unity as the basic guarantee of peace and the condition for the smooth development of all socialist countries.

    共产党人的声音
    波兰《人民论坛报》12月7日社论摘要
    新华社华沙8日电　波兰《人民论坛报》7日发表的以《共产党人的声音》为题的社论指出，在莫斯科举行的各国共产党和工人党会议，“以新的经验和新的任务丰富了国际共产主义运动的基本指针”。
    社论说，“决定我们时代特点的是两个对立的社会体系——社会主义和资本主义的斗争。由十月革命开始的人类从资本主义向社会主义的过渡大力向前发展——社会主义革命，民族解放革命和资本主义国家的阶级斗争在破坏着和缩小着帝国主义的阵地。世界社会主义体系正在成为人类发展的决定性因素。”其最本质的前提是社会主义国家的迅速发展。
    它说，“在资本主义世界，生产力与生产关系的矛盾日益尖锐。帝国主义垄断资本愈来愈与反动的国家机器相结合，控制了生活的各个方面。”“资本主义经济的无政府性造成了它的经济动摇，加深了在国内及国际范围内的资本主义矛盾。”“现代世界上民族解放斗争、反战斗争和阶级斗争的加强是资本主义总危机发展的新阶段的征兆。”
    社论谈到战争与和平问题时说，资本主义不产生和平而产生战争。帝国主义和自己的同盟者——主要的帝国主义国家一道建立了军事集团和军事基地体系，把疯狂的军备竞赛强加于世界。西德军国主义的复活就是这些趋势的明显的表现。
    但是，和平的命运决定于帝国主义者的意志的时期已经一去不复返了。保卫和平的广泛阵线可以防止新的战争。因此需要建立和巩固这种阵线，以便把争取和平的斗争集中于今天最迫切的任务，这些任务是：停止军备竞赛，禁止原子武器，禁止试验和生产这种武器，取消外国军事基地和从别国领土上撤退外国军队，解散军事集团，缔结对德和约和把西柏林变成非军事化的自由城市以及粉碎西德和日本的军国主义者和复仇主义者的行动。
    社论说，共产党人坚决地主张和平共处，动员世界各国人民为争取和平合作而斗争，号召为保卫和平积极行动。
    社论说，“和平共处丝毫不意味着放弃阶级斗争。共处是这个斗争的一种形式。”
    社论指出，“在目前，消灭殖民主义首先要求同一切形式的新殖民主义作斗争，它们企图保持殖民宗主国在已获解放的国家经济中的地位，把它们拖入军事集团，在那里建立军事专政统治或傀儡政府，通过挑起民族冲突和纠纷来瘫痪民族解放斗争。”
    社论指出，存在于目前时代的巨大的革命可能性的充分利用，取决于共产党人、取决于所有共产党的团结和力量、取决于他们的国际团结和一致。
    社论说，修正主义仍然是主要危险，它阉割马克思列宁主义的革命内容，解除劳动群众的武装。教条主义及宗派主义，如果不与之进行坚决的斗争，也可能成为这个或那个党的主要危险，使之不善于在变化了的条件下进行有效的活动。
    社论谈到了紧密的国际团结在今天具有特别重要的意义。社论说，形势和任务规定了苏共和中共这两个最大的党团结一致，社会主义国家及全世界共产党、工人党团结一致的重要性。
    社论说，所有我们的党都是独立的、平等的、遵循列宁主义总的原则，根据本国的需要确定自己的政策，根据国际主义思想相互支持。在国际共产主义运动中，苏联共产党是普遍公认的先锋队，它是最有经验的、最经受过锻炼的部队。
    社论说，波兰统一工人党站在社会主义阵营及整个国际工人运动不可动摇的团结一致的基础上，一贯遵循了莫斯科宣言的列宁主义指针。我们把这种团结一致视作和平的基本保证及所有社会主义国家顺利发展的条件。
