    Correctly Handle the Relations of Production in Rural People's Communes, Fully Mobilize the Production Enthusiasm of the Masses
    The Three-Level Ownership System is Suitable for the Current Level of
    Development of Productive Forces and the Consciousness of Peasants in Rural Areas

    The reason why the current rural people's communes should implement a three-level ownership system based on the production team is primarily because taking the production team, roughly equivalent to the original advanced cooperative, as the basic accounting unit allows the people's commune to overcome certain limitations of the advanced cooperative and to fully utilize the positive effects of some of the original advanced cooperative's effective systems and methods. On the one hand, it ensures that the main means of production, which still account for a significant proportion of the entire commune, such as draft animals, farm tools, and sideline tools, remain basically owned by the production team, roughly equivalent to the original advanced cooperative, and are fixed for use by the production team, thus enabling these means of production to play their role. On the other hand, the commune-level ownership of large-scale agricultural machinery that cannot be owned separately by the production teams and the unified allocation and use within the commune's scope are more conducive to promoting the improvement of labor productivity throughout the commune.

    The implementation of the three-level ownership system based on the production team, giving the commune, production team, and production team each responsibilities and powers suitable for the current level of production, is extremely beneficial to the development of production. At the current stage, the people's communes implement: the power of production, operation, and management mainly belongs to the production team, which serves as the basic accounting unit; the agricultural and sideline products managed by the production team, except for a small portion submitted to the commune for accumulation and taxes paid to the state in a unified manner by the commune, are uniformly distributed within the scope of the production team. Crop arrangements, output targets, and technical measures are all discussed by the members and jointly formulated by the production team and the production team. The production team, as the grassroots organization of production, contracts with the production team for output, labor, and costs. On the premise of ensuring the completion of the contracted output tasks, the team can manage small-scale sideline production that is not convenient for the production team to manage and make full use of the edges and corners of fields and other idle land. The contracted part of the team is entirely turned over to the production team for unified distribution; the surplus production and operating income beyond the contracted task, after a certain proportion is turned over to the production team, the remainder belongs to the team. The team can fix the use of labor, land, draft animals, and farm tools, and has the right to plant according to local conditions, to formulate technical measures, and to arrange various farm work. The commune's production plan is based on the production plan of the production team and the contracting plan of the production team. The commune also has the right to make suggestions to the production team based on the national plan and to make necessary balance and adjustments to the plan proposed by the production team. The implementation of such a system is conducive to fully发挥发挥 the role of the commune, production team, and production team these three levels of organizations, and conducive to使让 their enthusiasm are fully mobilized. The implementation of such a system can发挥发挥 the unified leadership role of the commune level,促使促使 the production teams to care about and actively manage production operations; at the same time, it strengthens the responsibility of each production team, so that the production team can carry out planting according to the production plan of the production team, and make use of time, place, and crop conditions, save labor, save agricultural costs, and精打细算地精打细算地 make use of the land, develop small-scale sideline production. Therefore, this is of course greatly beneficial to promoting the rapid development of agricultural and sideline production.

    The three-level ownership system based on the production team also has a great driving role in inspiring poor teams to catch up with rich teams and促使促使 the economic co-prosperity of the production teams within the people's commune. Due to different natural and historical conditions, as well as different operations, the level of productive forces and the quantity and quality of means of production of each production team are different, resulting in varying levels of income. This is an objective fact. The implementation of the three-level ownership system based on the production team is to出发出发 from recognizing this difference,促使促使 rich teams to work harder to increase production,促使促使 poor teams to work harder and strive to catch up with rich teams,促使促使 the production level and living standards of each production team to共同共同 improve, which is conducive to the development of production, and with the support of the commune economy, helps poor teams catch up with rich teams, so that the economic differences between the production teams are gradually reduced. In fact, in the past three years, due to the commune's strengthened leadership over poor teams, and with the support of the commune economy, and with the efforts of the poor teams to发愤图强, many poor teams have caught up with rich teams.

    Of course, emphasizing the production team as the basis under the current conditions does not mean that the development of collective ownership should not be developed. However, the development of collective ownership must rely on its own economic strength, that is, rely on the income of collective ownership enterprises, state investment and loans, and the extraction of a certain percentage of the public accumulation fund from the production team in accordance with regulations. Only on the premise that the production team economy develops rapidly can the commune's public accumulation fund gradually increase, and the collective ownership economy can gradually develop; only when the production team economy develops rapidly can the income of the production team and the living standards of the whole team's peasants be continuously and universally improved. Therefore, both the commune and the production team should maintain the basic ownership of the production team from the top and bottom.

    The three-level ownership system based on the production team not only conforms to the current level of awareness of the peasant masses but also helps to further improve the consciousness of the peasant masses. The improvement of peasants' consciousness, of course, is partly determined by the political and ideological work of the proletarian vanguard for the peasants, but existence determines consciousness, and thus also determines their class status, mode of labor, and way of life. China's peasants, due to their long-term participation in armed revolutionary struggles and land reform struggles under the leadership and education of the Party, have undergone fundamental changes in their class status since liberation, and their level of awareness has been greatly improved. This is a powerful guarantee for the rapid development of the socialist revolution in China's rural areas. After the mass rectification movement in 1957, and the large-scale agricultural production movement that followed, the political and ideological awareness of China's peasants has developed to an unprecedented height. It is on such an ideological basis that China's peasants have the demand to further improve the advanced cooperative to the people's commune; the establishment of the people's commune has some elements of ownership by the whole people and the budding of communism, although these are not the main ones at the current stage, but it points out the direction and is extremely beneficial to further improving the political and ideological awareness of the broad masses of peasants. Since their labor and life still have to be basically carried out within the small collective, and their income has to mainly rely on small collectives such as the production team, their awareness cannot but be subject to certain restrictions. In addition to caring about the interests of the commune, they cannot but directly care more about the interests of their own production team and production team, which is very natural. Therefore, the current stage of the people's commune, in addition to vigorously and continuously strengthening socialist and communist political and ideological education for peasants, the implementation of the three-level ownership system based on the production team is most suitable for the current level of awareness of peasants and can best mobilize their enthusiasm for production.

    The practice in the past three years has fully proved that at the current stage, the implementation of the three-level ownership system based on the production team is a great creation made by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao based on the principle of the dialectical relationship between productive forces and relations of production, combined with the current state of productive forces in China's rural areas and the awareness of peasants. It powerfully mobilized the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members from all aspects of ownership and greatly promoted the rapid improvement of agricultural productive forces.
    (Excerpt from An Daye's article in the Shanghai "Liberation" No. 22, 1960)
   Maintaining and strengthening the basic ownership of production teams from both the commune and team sides
   To fully develop the agricultural economy

    Relations of production must conform to the nature of the productive forces. The establishment of people's communes expanded and improved the collective ownership of the original agricultural cooperatives, pushing agricultural production and rural construction to a new climax. This is an example of our party correctly handling the contradictions between productive forces and relations of production. After the establishment of the people's commune, the Party, in accordance with the level of existing rural productive forces, clearly stipulated in a series of resolutions and instructions on consolidating and developing people's communes that the current stage of the people's commune is socialist in nature, implements a three-level ownership system, and is based on the ownership of the production team; in the distribution of income, three-level accounting is implemented, distribution according to labor, and the production team is the basic accounting unit; in the distribution of income of the production team, the wage portion should be the main one, and the proportion of the supply portion should not be too large; in production, hierarchical management under the unified leadership of the commune, the power of production operation and management mainly belongs to the production team, the commune has the right to make suggestions to the production team according to the national plan, and make necessary balance and adjustments to the plan proposed by the production team, but cannot control the production team too much or interfere too much; cooperation between production units must be equivalent exchange. The set of systems stipulated by the Party is completely adapted to the current level of productive forces in rural China, and thus is conducive to the development of production. This is because: First, China's rural areas have a poor foundation, and the level of development of productive forces is very low. Although there has been great development under the correct leadership of the Party in recent years, so far, agricultural machinery is still very scarce, and most of the land still relies on manual labor and animal power for cultivation. The actual situation that the land, draft animals, and farm tools that serve as the main means of production today belong to the production teams transformed from the original advanced agricultural cooperatives determines that the ownership of the production teams is fundamental. Second, there are not many means of production such as machinery and equipment owned by the commune, and the commune-run industry has just begun to develop. Its ownership is only a part of the economic weight of the entire commune. Collective ownership can change the important conditions in the existing ownership only if they rely on their existing economic strength, actively expand accumulation, gradually develop, and gradually make their own economic strength occupy a superior position in the economic weight of the entire commune. Third, after the production team of the original advanced cooperative transformed into the current production team of the people's commune, it still has a small part of the ownership, which has a considerable effect on mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members. The Party's policy is based on the above-mentioned actual situation. In this way, the relations of production of the people's commune are not only improved compared with the agricultural cooperatives but also maintain the authority of the three-level ownership and hierarchical management, and the relations of production are adjusted to suit the nature of the current productive forces, thereby promoting the development of productive forces. If we did not have the correct policy after the establishment of the people's commune, it would be impossible to guide the people's commune to quickly embark on a path of consolidated and sound development. If some people do not act in accordance with the Party's correct policies, and do not maintain the fundamental system of three-level ownership and the production team as the basis in actual work, this will hinder the development of productive forces.

    The Party has another important basis when formulating this policy, that is, the level of awareness of the broad masses of peasants. The Party always formulates correct policies from the demands of the masses and the degree that the masses can accept, and relies on its own policies to improve the awareness of the masses and mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses. In 1958, when the broad masses felt that the small circles of agricultural cooperatives had restrained their hands and feet, and spontaneously organized labor cooperation, and demanded to move forward, the Party firmly stood in front of the masses and guided the masses to move forward on the road of people's communes. But on the other hand, the Party also clearly saw that there was an imbalance in the level of production and the level of income of commune members among the various production teams transformed from agricultural cooperatives. The commune members had been engaged in labor in various different production units and received remuneration according to labor. To make these differences largely disappear, the production level and income level of commune members of each team should be largely balanced, mainly through the efforts of poor teams to 发愤图强, with the help of the government and brother teams, to accelerate the development of production and catch up with rich teams. Under the objective conditions that there are differences in the level of economic development of each team, canceling the differences in the income level of commune members of each team through other methods is not acceptable to commune members and is not conducive to the development of production. It is necessary to recognize this difference for a considerable period of time after the establishment of the people's commune in order to further mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses. The policy of implementing three-level ownership with the production team as the basis and unified distribution by the production team under the unified leadership of the commune takes care of this difference, which can enable more than 90% of the commune members to increase their income than before, and can also unite them to actively work for greater development of production and more income. At the same time, the production team extracts a certain proportion from its own public accumulation fund and hands it over to the commune to develop the commune-level economy, which will closely combine the interests of the large collective with the interests of the small collective, taking care of the immediate interests of the commune members and also taking care of the long-term interests of the commune members.

    Only by adhering to the implementation of three-level ownership with the production team as the basis, and the commune and the team taking the initiative to maintain the foundation of the production team from both the top and bottom, can the economies of the three levels of the entire commune be truly and fully developed. Because the means of production such as land, draft animals, and farm tools are basically owned by the production team, agricultural production is basically managed by the production team, and the collective income of the commune members mainly relies on the distribution of the production team, the service objects of commune-run industry are the agricultural production managed by the production team, and the team contracts the production tasks assigned to it by the production team, so no matter which aspect is separated from the foundation of the production team, it is impossible to develop its own economy alone. Only when the production of the production team develops well and the economic strength is strong can the commune-run industry develop more and faster, and can extract more accumulation from the production team. A tall building starts from the ground. The foundation is solid, and the high-rise buildings built can be consolidated. If we only focus on developing the collective ownership economy in a one-sided manner, without maintaining and developing the economy of the production team, it will make the collective ownership economy hang in the air, eager to achieve success without achieving it. Team cadres and commune members engaged in labor in the team should faithfully implement the contracted output tasks assigned by the production team and strive for overproduction. The team can only continuously increase its own income and get more overproduction rewards by maintaining the continuous development of the production team economy.
    (Excerpt from Wang Han's article in the "China Youth Daily" on December 1)
   Adhering to the three-level ownership system based on the team
   Is the central link in consolidating and improving rural people's communes

    Ownership is the decisive link in the relations of production. On the basis of a certain system of ownership of the means of production, a certain relationship between people in production and a relationship of product distribution are formed. If ownership changes, the relationship between people in production and the relationship of product distribution will also change accordingly. The three-level ownership system based on the production team is the fundamental system of the people's commune at the current stage. Therefore, in order to give full play to the superiority of the people's commune and rapidly develop agricultural production, we should improve this system at present. Only by adhering to the three-level ownership system based on the team can we ensure the implementation of distribution according to labor, the "three guarantees and one reward" system, and a series of other policies of the Party on the people's commune, can we correctly handle the relations of all parties within the commune, and more fully mobilize the production enthusiasm of the masses. Therefore, ownership is a fundamental issue that relates to the development of production and the interests of the masses, and it is also the issue that the masses are most concerned about. In the work of improving and consolidating the people's commune, grasping this central link first provides the prerequisite for correctly implementing other policies related to the people's commune.

    In the three-level ownership system of the people's commune, the production team level is the basic one. Maintaining and strengthening the basic ownership of the production team and doing a good job in the production of the production team is an important link in improving and consolidating the system of the people's commune and further developing agricultural production. We should tightly grasp this link and maintain and strengthen the basic ownership of the production team from both the commune and the production team. For example, the land, labor force, draft animals, farm tools, funds, etc. of the production team should be fixed in order to strengthen the material foundation for the production team to develop production. Since the production team ownership is basic and the production team is the basic accounting unit, the people's commune should also mainly rely on the production team in production operation and management, give full play to the enthusiasm and initiative of the production team, so that the production team can, under the guidance of the national plan and under the unified leadership of the commune, and in accordance with the specific situation of the team, discuss with the commune members and jointly formulate a production plan with the production team, arrange crop planting, determine output targets and technical measures, arrange production activities, and reasonably use the labor force. The commune's production plan should be based on the production plan of the production team and the production plan of the production team. The unified leadership of the commune is completely necessary, but because the specific conditions of each team are different, it is not necessary to require uniformity in everything.

    In addition to earnestly adhering to the basic team ownership, strengthening the leadership of the production team, and doing a good job in the production of the production team, it is also necessary to handle the relationship between the production team and the production team well, and mobilize the enthusiasm of the production team and the masses of commune members. The production team is the contracting unit and the grassroots unit of the people's commune for organizing production and managing the lives of the masses. The interests of the production team and the masses of commune members are the most direct, and therefore the commune members are very concerned. The production team should earnestly implement the "three guarantees and one reward" system for the production team. The "three guarantees and one reward" is a very good form for the people's commune to mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, implement unified leadership, and implement hierarchical management, and it is also the main content of the small part of ownership of the production team. Adhering to the small part of ownership of the production team and earnestly implementing the "three guarantees and one reward" can encourage the advanced and promote the backward, which is conducive to mobilizing the enthusiasm of the team cadres and the masses of commune members. Therefore, the "three guarantees and one reward" should be earnestly implemented, and the contracting targets must be appropriate and leave room for maneuver, so that the production team can indeed have products to overproduce, and overproduction must be rewarded. The land, labor force, livestock, and farm tools used by the production team should be fixed in order to facilitate the production team to actively arrange the labor force, reasonably use the land, and give full play to its enthusiasm and strive for overproduction. When organizing labor cooperation between the production team and other economic relations, the principle of voluntary mutual benefit and equivalent exchange must be adhered to, and production teams should be allowed to have certain differences in income distribution. Of course, the production team also has a great responsibility for doing a good job in the production of the production team and maintaining the basic ownership of the production team. The production team should actively complete the contracted output tasks and verify the output. The agricultural products harvested by the team and other operating income, all within the contracted output task, should be truthfully turned over to the production team for unified distribution; the overproduced part should also be turned over to the production team in a small proportion according to the prescribed ratio for unified distribution.

    Adhering to the basic ownership of the production team and the small part of ownership of the production team does not mean ignoring the part of ownership of the commune and no longer developing the collective ownership economy. At present, although the commune ownership is still partial, it contains the elements of ownership by the whole people, and it is this part of the commune ownership that represents the great hope and great future of the people's commune. Therefore, the part of ownership of the commune must be adhered to, the fixed proportion of public accumulation of the commune must be adhered to, and the collective ownership economy should be developed so that the part of the commune ownership can be gradually expanded. The method of developing the collective ownership economy is to vigorously promote the economic development of the production team while relying on the accumulation of the collective ownership economy itself, tapping its own potential, and developing simultaneously with the team ownership economy. The development of production in each production team means the development of production in the whole commune, and the development of the collective ownership economy will have a solid foundation.

### 正确处理农村人民公社的生产关系，充分调动群众的生产积极性

专栏：报刊文摘

    正确处理农村人民公社的生产关系，充分调动群众的生产积极性
    三级所有制适合当前农村
    生产力的发展水平和农民的觉悟程度
    现阶段农村人民公社所以要实行以生产队为基础的三级所有制，首先是因为以大体上相当于原高级社的生产队作为基本核算单位，使人民公社既可以克服高级社的某种局限性，又能充分发挥高级社原有的行之有效的一些好制度、好办法的积极作用。一方面使在目前整个公社中占有重要比重的主要生产资料，如耕畜、农具和副业工具等等，仍基本上归大体上相当于原来高级社的生产队所有，而归生产小队固定使用，就能够发挥这些生产资料的作用；一方面，由公社一级占有各生产队所不能单独占有的大型农业机械，在公社范围内统一调配使用，也就更有利于促进整个公社劳动生产率的提高。
    实行以生产队为基础的三级所有制，使公社、生产队和生产小队各有适合于当前生产水平所需要的责任和权力，对于发展生产是极为有利的。现阶段人民公社实行：生产经营管理的权力主要归作为基本核算单位的生产队，生产队经营的农副产品，除以一小部分提交公社积累和由公社统一向国家缴纳税收外，在本生产队范围统一分配。作物安排、产量指标和技术措施，均经过社员讨论由生产队和生产小队共同商量制定。由作为生产基层组织的生产小队，向生产队包产、包工、包成本，在保证完成包产任务的前提下，小队可以经营不便于生产队经营的小型副业生产和充分利用田边地角及其他闲散土地。小队的包产部分全部上缴生产队统一分配；超产部分和包产任务以外的经营收入，除以一定比例上缴生产队外，其余归小队所有。小队可以固定使用劳动力、土地、耕畜和农具，有权因地种植、有权制定技术措施、有权安排各种农活。公社的生产计划，则建立在生产队的生产计划和生产小队的包产计划的基础上，公社也有权根据国家计划向生产队提出建议并对生产队提出的计划做必要的平衡和调整。实行这样的制度，就有利于充分发挥公社、生产队和生产小队这三级组织各自的作用，有利于使它们的积极性都充分调动起来。实行这样的制度，既可以发挥公社一级的统一领导作用，促使各生产队关心和积极搞好生产的经营管理工作；同时又加强了各生产小队的责任感，使生产小队可以按照生产队的生产计划进行因时、因地、因作物制宜的种植，节约劳动力、节约农业成本和精打细算地利用土地，发展小型的副业生产。因而，这就当然大大有利于促进农副业生产的迅速发展。
    以生产队为基础的三级所有制，在激发穷队赶上富队，促使人民公社内各生产队的经济共同提高上，也有着很大的推动作用。由于自然条件和历史条件的不同，以及经营好坏的不同，各生产队的生产力水平、生产资料的数量、质量都有着一定差别，从而收入水平也有高有低，这是客观事实。实行以生产队为基础的三级所有制，就是从承认这种差别出发，促使富队更加努力增加生产，促使穷队更加发愤图强，立志赶上富队，促使各生产队的生产水平和生活水平共同提高，有利于生产的发展，并且在公社经济的支援下，帮助穷队赶上富队，使各生产队的经济差别逐步缩小。事实上，近三年来，由于公社加强了对穷队的领导，并且在公社经济的支援下，在穷队的发愤图强的努力下，已经使不少穷队赶上了富队。
    当然，强调在目前条件下以生产队为基础，决不意味着不要发展社有经济。但是社有经济的发展，必须依靠本身的经济力量，也就是要依靠社有企业的收入，国家投资和贷款，以及按照规定向生产队提取一定比例的公积金而发展的。只有在生产队经济迅速发展的前提下，公社的公积金才能逐步增加，社有经济才能逐步发展起来；也只有生产队经济迅速发展起来，才能使生产小队的收入和全队农民的生活水平不断地普遍地提高。所以，公社和生产小队都应该分别从上下两方面来维护生产队的基本所有制。
    以生产队为基础的三级所有制，既符合当前农民群众的觉悟水平，又有利于进一步提高农民群众的觉悟。农民觉悟程度的提高，固然一方面决定于无产阶级先锋队对于农民的政治思想工作，但是，存在决定意识，因而又决定于他们的阶级地位、劳动方式和生活方式。我国的农民，由于长期在党的领导和教育下，积极参加了武装革命斗争、土地改革斗争，在解放以后，阶级地位起了根本的变化，觉悟程度大大提高。这是我国农村中社会主义革命迅速开展的有力保证。经过1957年的全民整风运动，以及随之而来的大规模的农业生产运动，我国农民的政治思想觉悟，发展到了空前未有的高度。正是在这样的思想基础上，我国农民才有了把高级社进一步提高到人民公社的要求；人民公社的建立，有了若干全民所有制的因素和共产主义的萌芽，尽管这些在当前阶段还不是主要的，但它指出了方向，对于进一步提高广大农民的政治思想觉悟，是极为有利的。而目前他们的劳动和生活既然还不能不基本上在小集体内进行，他们的收入又不能不主要的依靠生产队那样的小集体，因而，他们的觉悟，就还不能不受到一定的限制，他们在关心公社利益之外，不能不比较更直接地关心本生产队和生产小队的利益，这是很自然的。因此，现阶段的人民公社，除了应该大力地不断地加强对于农民的社会主义、共产主义的政治思想教育外，实行以生产队为基础的三级所有制，就最适合于农民目前的觉悟水平，最能调动他们的生产积极性。
    近三年来的实践充分证明，在现阶段，人民公社实行以生产队为基础的三级所有制，是党中央和毛主席根据生产力和生产关系的辩证关系的原理，结合我国农村当前生产力状况和农民的觉悟程度，而作出的一个伟大创造。它有力地从所有制的各个环节上，调动了广大社员群众的生产积极性，大大地促进了农业生产力的迅速提高。
    （摘自上海《解放》1960年第22期安大业的文章）
    从公社和小队两方面维护和加强生
    产队的基本所有制，全面发展农业经济
    生产关系一定要适合生产力的性质。人民公社的建立，使原来农业合作社的集体所有制扩大了，提高了，把农业生产和农村各项建设事业推向新的高潮。这是我们党正确处理生产力与生产关系之间矛盾的一个范例。当人民公社建立起来以后，党按照现有农村生产力的水平，在有关巩固发展人民公社的一系列的决议、指示中明确规定：现阶段的人民公社是社会主义性质的，实行三级所有制，并且以生产队的所有权为基础；在收益的分配上实行三级核算，按劳分配，以生产队为基本核算单位；在生产队收益的分配部分中，要以工资部分为主，供给部分所占的比例不应过大；在生产上实行公社统一领导下的分级管理，生产经营管理的权力主要归生产队，公社有权根据国家计划向生产队提出建议，并且对生产队提出的计划作必要的平衡和调整，但是不能对生产队控制过死，干涉过多；各生产单位之间进行协作，要等价交换。党规定的这样一整套制度，是完全适应我国农村现时生产力水平的，因而有利于生产的发展。这是因为：第一，我国农村的老底子是“一穷二白”，生产力发展水平是很低的，这些年来在党的正确领导下虽然有了很大发展，但直到目前为止，农业机器还很少，绝大部分土地还靠手工劳动和畜力耕作。而那些作为当前主要生产资料的土地、耕畜、农具都是属于原来高级农业合作社转变成的生产队所有的，这个实际情况决定了生产队的所有权是基本的。第二，属于公社所有的机器设备等生产资料还不多，社办工业刚刚开始发展，它的所有权在全公社的经济比重中还只是部分的。社有经济只有在依靠自己现有的经济力量，积极扩大积累，逐步发展，逐渐使自己的经济力量在全公社经济比重中占到优越地位的时候才具备了改变现有的所有制的一个重要条件。第三，原来高级合作社的生产队转变为现在人民公社的生产小队以后，仍然还有小部分的所有权，它对于调动广大社员的积极性有相当的作用。党的政策就是从上述实际情况出发而制订的。这样，人民公社的生产关系，既比农业合作社有所提高，又保持了三级所有、分级管理的权限，生产关系就调整得适合当前生产力的性质，从而推进生产力向前发展。如果我们在人民公社建立以后，没有正确的政策，就不可能引导人民公社迅速走上巩固的健全的发展道路。如果有人不按照党的正确政策办事，在实际工作中不是去维护三级所有、队为基础的根本制度，这就会妨碍生产力的发展。
    党在制定这一条政策的时候，还有另一个重要根据，那就是广大农民群众的觉悟程度。党总是从群众的要求和群众所能接受的程度出发来制订出正确的政策，又依靠自己的政策去提高群众的觉悟，调动群众的积极性。在1958年，广大群众感到农业合作社的小圈子束缚了他们的手脚，自动起来组织劳动协作，要求前进一步的时候，党坚决站在群众前面，引导群众向人民公社化道路前进。但在另一方面，党也清醒地看到：从农业合作社转变过来的各个生产队之间，存在着生产水平和社员收入水平不平衡的状况，社员曾经是在各个有差别的生产单位中从事劳动，按劳动取得报酬的，要使这些差别大体消失，各队的生产水平和社员收入水平大体趋于平衡，主要是要通过穷队在政府和兄弟队的帮助下，发愤图强，加速发展生产，赶上富队。在各队的经济发展水平客观上存在着差别的情况下，通过其他办法来取消各队的社员收入水平之间的差别是社员们所不能接受的，对发展生产是不利的。在人民公社建立后的一个相当长的时间内必须承认这种差别，才能进一步调动群众的积极性。实行三级所有，队为基础，在公社统一领导下由生产队统一分配的政策，就照顾了这种差别，就能使90％以上的社员都能比以前增加收入，也就能把他们团结起来为更大地发展生产，更多地增加收入而积极劳动。同时，生产队从自己的公积金中提取一定比例上交给公社，发展公社一级的经济，这就会使大集体的利益同小集体的利益紧密结合起来，既照顾了社员们的眼前利益，又照顾到社员们的长远利益。
    只有坚持实行三级所有，队为基础，公社和小队都主动地从上下两方面来维护生产队的基础，才真正能使全公社的三级所有的经济都得到全面发展。因为土地、耕畜、农具等生产资料基本上归生产队所有，农业生产基本上由生产队经营，社员们的集体收入主要靠生产队分配，社办工业的服务对象是生产队所经营的农业生产，小队则是承包生产队交给它的生产任务，所以无论那一方面脱离了生产队这一基础，都不可能单独地发展自己的经济。只有生产队的生产发展得好，经济力量雄厚，社办工业才能发展得又多又快，才能从生产队提取更多的积累。万丈高楼从地起，地基打得结实，建筑起来的高楼大厦才能巩固。如果片面地只顾发展社有经济，不去维护和发展生产队的经济，那么会使社有经济悬在半空，欲速而不达。小队干部和在小队从事劳动的社员，应当忠实地执行生产队交给的包产任务，并且力争超产。小队只有维护生产队经济不断发展，才能不断增加自己的收入，才能更多地得到超产奖励。

    坚持以队为基础的三级所有制，
    是巩固和健全农村人民公社的中心环节
    所有制是生产关系的决定环节。在一定的生产资料所有制的基础上，形成了人们在生产中一定的相互关系和产品分配关系。所有制发生了变化，人们在生产中的相互关系和产品分配关系都会随着发生变化。以生产队为基础的三级所有制，是现阶段人民公社的根本制度。因此，为了充分发挥人民公社的优越性，迅速发展农业生产，当前我们应当健全这种所有制。只有坚持以队为基础的三级所有制，才能保证按劳分配、“三包一奖”以及党关于人民公社的其他一系列的政策的贯彻实现，才能正确地处理公社内部的各方面的关系，更充分地调动群众的生产积极性。所以，所有制是关系到生产的发展、关系到群众利益的根本问题，也是群众最关心的问题。在健全和巩固人民公社的工作中，首先抓住这一中心环节，就给正确地贯彻执行有关人民公社的其他各项政策提供了前提条件。
    人民公社的三级所有制，生产队一级是基本的。维护和加强生产队的基本所有制，搞好生产队的生产，这是健全和巩固人民公社制度，进一步发展农业生产的重要环节。我们应当紧紧抓住这一环节，从公社和生产小队这上下两方面去维护和加强生产队的基本所有制。如对于生产队的土地、劳动力、耕畜、农具、资金等等，应当固定下来，以便加强生产队发展生产的物质基础。既然生产队所有制是基本的，生产队是基本核算单位，人民公社在生产经营管理上，也应当主要依靠生产队，充分发挥生产队的积极性和主动性，使生产队能够在国家计划的指导下，在公社的统一领导下，按照本队的具体情况，经过社员群众讨论，和生产小队共同商量制订生产计划，安排作物的种植，确定产量指标和技术措施，安排生产活动，合理使用劳动力。公社的生产计划，应当建立在生产队的生产计划和生产小队的包产计划的基础上。公社的统一领导是完全必要的，但是，由于各队的具体情况不同，也不要事事都要求统一。
    除了认真坚持基本队有制，加强对生产队的领导，搞好生产队的生产以外，还必须处理好生产队与生产小队的关系，调动起生产小队和社员群众的积极性。生产小队是包产单位，是人民公社组织生产和管理群众生活的基层单位，生产小队的利益和社员群众的关系最直接，因而社员十分关心。生产队对生产小队，应当认真贯彻执行“三包一奖”的制度。“三包一奖”是人民公社发动群众、依靠群众，实行统一领导、分级管理的一种很好的形式，同时也是生产小队小部分所有制的主要内容。坚持生产小队的小部分所有制，认真实行“三包一奖”，可以鼓励先进，推动落后，有利于调动小队干部和社员群众的积极性。因此，应当认真实行“三包一奖”，并且包产指标一定要适当和留有余地，使生产小队确实有产可超，超了产就一定要奖励。归生产小队使用的土地、劳动力、牲畜、农具，应当固定下来，以利于生产小队主动安排劳动力，合理使用土地，充分发挥其积极性，努力争取超产。在组织生产小队与生产小队之间的劳力协作和处理其他经济关系时，必须坚持自愿两利、等价交换原则，并允许小队与小队之间在收入分配上有一定的差别。当然，生产小队对搞好生产队的生产，维护生产队的基本所有制，也负有很大的责任。生产小队应当积极完成包产任务，核实产量。小队收获的农产品和其他经营的收入，凡是在包产任务以内的，都应当如实上缴给生产队统一分配；超产部分也应该按照规定的比例，上缴小部分给生产队，统一分配。
    坚持生产队的基本所有制和生产小队的小部分所有制，并不意味着忽视公社的部分所有制和不再发展社有经济。目前，公社所有制虽然还是部分的，但它包含着全民所有制的成分，正是这部分公社所有制代表着人民公社的伟大希望和伟大前途。因此，公社的部分所有制必须坚持，公社的一定比例的公共积累必须坚持，社有经济应当发展，使公社所有制部分逐步扩大。发展社有经济的办法是，在大力促进生产队经济发展的同时，依靠社有经济本身的积累，挖掘本身的潜力，与队有经济同时发展。各个生产队的生产发展了，也就是全社的生产发展了，社有经济的发展也就有了坚实的基础。
