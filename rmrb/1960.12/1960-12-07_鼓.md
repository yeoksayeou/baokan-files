    Drum

    Lin Quan

This drum, closely following the secretary for thirty years, has traversed countless rivers and mountains. The secretary carried it on his shoulders since he was eighteen, now his temples are turning white. In the Great Revolution, a red-tasseled spear was clenched in his hand, a Soviet was established amidst the drumbeats, and the drumbeats illuminated the sky with red clouds! The drum beats in the front, the flag waves in the front, one after another, the peasant brothers left their homes, carrying steel guns like forests on their shoulders, following the red flag to carry out the revolution. The drumbeats grew louder and louder, resounding before the Long March's banner, echoing across ten thousand miles of sky, echoing from the Yan River to Yan'an! The drumbeats resounded in Nanniwan, resounding in the hearts of the villagers, resounding in the harvest festival of the army and the people's joint celebration, in the drumbeats, mountains of rice and grain piled up.

The secretary beats the drum and moves forward, reporting victories every year; the drumbeats fly over the Yangtze River's thousand-mile waves, beating until the five-star red flag flies all over the sky! In the drumbeats, power plants are built on wasteland, in the drumbeats, chimneys rise and emit clouds and smoke, in the drumbeats, steam turbines form a grand chorus, in the drumbeats, thousands of miles of electric light flash everywhere! Revolutionary drum, victory drum, closely following the secretary for thirty years, now the secretary beats the drum again, responding to Chairman Mao's call to go to the front lines! The revolutionary drumbeats resound continuously, the revolutionary red flag is even more vibrant, under the red flag, a team of revolutionary soldiers, just like the troops who set out for Qinchuan back then!

Now, the revolutionary soldiers under the red flag are red electricians and technicians, the vehicles are fully loaded with motors in complete sets, heading to the forefront of agriculture! How many nights did the light shine brightly under the secretary's window, how many nights did frost sprinkle on the secretary's padded jacket! How many dawns before the rooster crowed, the secretary's drumbeats shook in all directions! In the drumbeats, ten thousand electric lights bloomed like flowers, in the drumbeats, the commune's factory motors sang loudly; electric irrigation stations spout thousands of silver dragons dancing on the fields, pearls are scattered on ten thousand acres of seedlings... Just like the triumphant songs of battle in the past, the secretary's drumbeats are deafening!

The drumbeats fly to Beijing, reporting good news to Chairman again! At the "Victory Celebration," he swears an oath again, the sun rises in the east and sets out again; villagers, don't try to keep him, the drumbeats urge people on! Like the farewell to the villagers at the village entrance in the past, the secretary prepares and beats the drum to go to the front again, the revolutionary red flag is raised higher and higher, flying over village after village. In the drumbeats, camps are set up to fight a "new battle," in the drumbeats, another grand completion ceremony is held; in the drumbeats, the socialist electric light shines for thousands of miles, illuminating the commune's land!

Illuminating the commune's evergreen tree, illuminating thousands of happy smiling faces, illuminating the golden waves surging across the fields, illuminating the mountains of rice and grain reaching to the heavens! This drum, closely following the secretary for thirty years, has traversed countless rivers and mountains, the secretary carried it on his shoulders since he was eighteen, now his temples are turning white! Revolutionary drum, fighting drum, resounding on the great road of communism, now beating on the front line of agricultural production, forever resounding on the forefront of the revolution...

    鼓
    林泉这面鼓，紧跟书记三十年，越过万水走千山，书记十八岁上肩头背，如今两鬓白斑斑。当年闹起大革命，一杆红缨手中攥，鼓声里立起苏维埃，鼓声里红霞照满天！鼓在前面敲，旗在前面打，一个个庄稼弟兄离家园，钢枪如林肩上扛，跟着红旗把革命干。鼓声越敲越响，响在长征的大旗前，响过长空一万里，响过延河到延安！鼓声响到南泥湾，响在乡亲们的心坎坎，响在军民联欢的丰收会，鼓声里堆起座座米粮山。书记敲鼓向前走，捷报报过一个胜利年；鼓声飞过长江千里浪，敲到五星红旗飘满天！鼓声里，废根基上建电厂，鼓声里，长起烟囱吐云烟，鼓声里，汽轮机组成大合唱，鼓声里，千里电光万里闪！革命的鼓，胜利的鼓，紧跟书记三十年，如今书记又擂鼓，响应毛主席的号召上前线！革命的鼓声响连天，革命的红旗更鲜艳，红旗下一队革命的兵，好似当年出征过秦川！如今红旗下革命的兵，是红色的电工、技术员，车马上满载电机配成套，奔向农业最前线！多少晚书记的窗下灯光亮，多少夜书记的袄上洒寒霜！多少个拂晓鸡未啼，书记的鼓声震四方！鼓声里，万盏电灯亮开了花，鼓声里，公社工厂的马达放声唱；电灌站吐出千条银龙地头舞，颗颗珍珠洒在万顷田苗上……如同当年战斗奏凯歌，书记的鼓呵擂得震天响！鼓声飞向北京去，又给主席报喜讯！“庆功会”上又誓师，日出东方又出征；乡亲们呵莫挽留，鼓声点点紧催人！像当年村头辞别众乡亲，书记整装擂鼓又上前方，革命的红旗举得高更高，飘过一村又一庄。鼓声里，安营再打“新战役”，鼓声里，又一次落成大典礼；鼓声里，社会主义的电光千万丈，普照在公社的土地上！照耀公社的万年长青树，照耀千万张幸福的笑脸，照耀遍野金浪如潮涌，照耀座座米粮高山拄天堂！这面鼓呵，紧跟书记三十年，越过万水走千山，书记十八岁上肩头背，如今两鬓白斑斑！革命的鼓，战斗的鼓，响在共产主义的大道上，如今敲到农业生产第一线，永远响在革命的最前方……
