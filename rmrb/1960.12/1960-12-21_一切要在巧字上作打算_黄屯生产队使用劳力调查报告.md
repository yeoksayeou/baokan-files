Everything Must Be Planned Cleverly
——Investigation Report on Labor Use in Huangtun Production Team
Wang Ruipu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Shen County Committee, Hebei Province

Can the current problem of labor shortage on the agricultural front be solved? How to solve it? This is an extremely important issue in current agricultural production. Understanding this is of great significance for further implementing the Party's agricultural production policy of vigorously developing agriculture, vigorously developing grain, and planting more, harvesting more, producing high yields, and harvesting more. To this end, I recently conducted an investigation in the Huangtun Production Team of Xiaofang Commune and initially found some clues to solve this problem.

The Huangtun Production Team is located in the southeast of Shen County. Historically, it was known as one of the "Lower Four Tuns" (including Houtun, Litun, and Jitun), a village with low-lying terrain, frequent floods in the past, few people, large land area, weak labor force, and lack of production tools. The whole team has 1,383 mu of land, 233 people, 69 able-bodied and semi-able-bodied men and women, and 25 old and weak draught animals. The average cultivated land per person is 5.94 mu, which is 90% higher than the average of 3 mu per person in the commune; each laborer is responsible for 20 mu of cultivated land, which is 72% higher than the average of 11.6 mu per laborer in the commune; each animal is responsible for an average of 55.3 mu of cultivated land, which is 10% higher than the average of 50 mu in the commune. Moreover, all of it is red soil, which is not easy to cultivate. However, since the establishment of advanced cooperatives, especially since communization, Huangtun has completed all agricultural tasks 10 to 15 days earlier than its neighboring villages. Taking this year's autumn harvest as an example, wheat planting was 15 days earlier, autumn harvest was 10 days earlier, and autumn plowing was 6 days earlier. Since 1957, grain production has been increasing year after year. What is the reason? Branch Secretary Yin Jinsheng told us: "We must use labor like using money and materials. Everything must be planned cleverly, so that 'one star can manage two'."

Clearly Define the Direction and Focus on Key Tasks

According to our national economy's development policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, the main labor force must be used in agricultural production. Grasping the "grain" guideline can promote the development of other undertakings. Since the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes in 1958, a high tide has emerged in the development of various undertakings. The Huangtun Production Team Party Branch also tried to make all work a "ten thousand horses galloping forward, advancing together." It planned to establish sewing factories, wood factories, repair factories, fertilizer factories, pig farms, and sheep farms, develop diversified economies, plant lotus roots, raise fish, and add logistics, water conservancy, and industrial labor run by the commune. At least 31 people were needed, accounting for nearly half of the team's total labor force; and the further implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" increased the amount of agricultural labor by 30%, creating a very prominent contradiction between labor and production needs. Obviously, continuing to do so would inevitably lengthen the front, disperse labor, and affect the continued leap forward in agricultural production. In this situation, the branch repeatedly studied the instructions of the higher-level Party committee and analyzed the characteristics of the team: large land area with a small labor force, unable to develop all industries at the same time, and the spirit of "agriculture as the foundation, grain first" must be implemented. After unifying the thinking of cadres and commune members, the labor force was re-adjusted and arranged. Since 1959, more than 80% of the labor force has been invested in agricultural production. This year, the labor force invested in agriculture reached 59 people, accounting for 86.9% of the total labor force, and the strong and able-bodied labor force invested in agriculture accounted for 80%. From the perspective of labor use, it also reflects the guiding ideology of taking agriculture as the foundation. This year, a total of 19,279 workdays were used, of which 15,832 workdays were used for agriculture, accounting for 82.11% of the total workdays for various undertakings throughout the year. From the perspective of cadre strength, two of the three branch committee members in the village grasped agriculture, and 14 of the 16 Party and Youth League members in the village were arranged on the agricultural production front, thus ensuring a superior force on the agricultural front.

Reasonable Layout of Agricultural Work

The layout of agricultural work is a strategic issue for the year's agricultural production and also the foundation for the rational use of labor. A good arrangement of agricultural work can give full play to the enthusiasm of all laborers, so that each laborer can do his best, show his talents, and effectively regulate the contradiction between the large amount of agricultural work and the lack of labor. On the contrary, an improper layout in one link will cause a disparity in the amount of agricultural work, uneven busyness and leisure of the labor force, loss of opportunities at critical moments, affecting the overall situation, delaying agricultural time, and causing passivity. Therefore, the layout of agricultural work must also be "clever." What is clever about the agricultural work layout of the Huangtun Production Team? First, all agricultural miscellaneous work is concentrated in the agricultural slack season, so that the agricultural slack season can catch up with the agricultural busy season; second, in the crop configuration and arrangement of stubble, the planting and maturity times of various crops are reasonably matched to distribute the agricultural work of field management as much as possible, balance the agricultural work of busy and slack seasons, shorten leisure time and rush time, and extend normal working time; third, rationally set up farmland capital construction projects to save labor and reduce labor use.

As soon as the autumn harvest last year ended, they calculated the various agricultural tasks for this year, which required a total of 19,279 workdays. However, mobilizing all the people in the village who can do some work and calculating according to the highest attendance rate, the maximum is only about 17,000 workdays. In order to solve this problem, they used all the agricultural miscellaneous work throughout the year during the time before spring and after autumn and during the winter slack season. For example, the fertilizer used for spring sowing was all transported to the fields last winter, and more than 1,300 carts of foot-padding soil were pulled back in combination with sending manure, enough for the whole year. Chopping grass is also concentrated in the agricultural slack season. In the past, two grass-cutting knives occupied four people, who could not go to the fields to produce during the busy season; last year, the method was changed, and more than 1.36 million catties were chopped at once during the winter slack season, enough for all the livestock to eat for a year, saving 720 workdays during the busy season. Only by doing the main agricultural tasks such as making adobe, chopping grass, pulling soil, and sending manure in advance, more than 2,700 workdays were freed up for the busy season, effectively regulating the contradiction between labor and agricultural work.

However, the busiest and most concentrated period of agricultural work is the summer and autumn busy season. Simply rushing to work during the agricultural slack season cannot solve all the problems. In the past, as soon as the summer busy season began, wheat harvesting, threshing, sending fertilizer, summer plowing, summer planting, and summer hoeing were all crowded together. With a little negligence, either the land would be barren or it could not be sown in time, affecting production. The workload of the three autumns is even greater. Harvesting and sowing start at the same time, and autumn plowing must be carried out as soon as possible, otherwise, the moisture will not be preserved, affecting the sowing of the coming year, which will create a passive situation for the year's agricultural production. In the past, this village alone needed 7,975 workdays in the four months of June, July, September, and October, accounting for 52% of the year's working days. According to the past situation, the highest attendance rate during this period was only 6,040 workdays, a difference of 1,935. Taking wheat harvesting as an example, from the start of harvesting on June 6 to the completion of summer sowing, it cannot exceed half a month. At the same time, in this short period of time, threshing, sending manure, plowing, and hoeing for spring seedlings must also be completed. According to this requirement, 1,732 labor workdays and 386 animal power workdays are needed, but the team's highest attendance rate is only 1,200 labor workdays and 375 animal power workdays. Their solution to this problem is: first, in the crop configuration, appropriately match the varieties that mature early and those that mature late, so that some agricultural work from planting management to harvesting and storage is planned in advance and staggered, avoiding the phenomenon of crowding agricultural work in the middle period. Of the 320 mu of wheat planted last year, 200 mu were planted with "Plain 50," which matures five days earlier. In addition, they sent the fertilizer for summer sowing to the fields before harvesting wheat. In this way, 750 labor workdays and 128 animal power workdays were prepared before the peak of the summer busy season, freeing up hands for summer harvesting and sowing. The same method was adopted in the preparation for the three autumns and for next year's bumper harvest, solving the contradictions and gaining the initiative.

The Key to Using Labor Lies in Skill

Under the guidance of the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, if mobilizing troops and generals from all fronts, concentrating forces, and making a layout for the year's production is a strategic issue, then the use of troops in a specific agricultural task is a tactical issue. Of course, a good handling of strategic issues will lay the foundation and provide the premise for overall victory; however, a poor handling of a tactical issue often affects the overall victory. According to the Party Central Committee's policy of vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain, the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture must be implemented at a higher level, and the amount of agricultural labor used has greatly increased. However, our level of mechanization is not high, and there are certain restrictions on the extension of working hours. Therefore, in the use of labor, we must implement Chairman Mao's military strategic thinking, "use troops skillfully," "use one as ten," and produce more work with the same time, the same tools, and the same labor. Their specific methods are:

(1) Under the unified plan and overall arrangement, use people according to their abilities, assign work according to their skills, and assign labor according to the work. In order not to waste a labor force, the "ten assign, ten don't assign" principle was implemented in assigning work, that is: do not assign multiple people to do work that can be done by fewer people, do not assign able-bodied labor to work that should be assigned to semi-able-bodied labor, do not assign semi-able-bodied labor to work that should be assigned to auxiliary labor, do not assign male labor to work that should be assigned to female labor, do not assign strong labor to work that should be assigned to weak labor, do not assign two animals to work that should be assigned to one animal, do not use two processes if one process can be used, do not assign labor separately for work that can be combined, do not assign people with low skills to work that should be assigned to people with high skills, and do not occupy full time for work that should be done in sporadic time.

(2) Combine the strong and the weak, streamline operations, and form a complete set. There are many types of agricultural work, each with its own characteristics. Agricultural work has its light and heavy aspects, its strong and weak aspects, and its high and low technical requirements. A clever combination of the two can achieve twice the result with half the effort. They have many forms of supporting each other, and the tactics vary according to the characteristics of the crops.

(3) One person with multiple skills, one specialty with multiple abilities, linked sets, and mutual links. Do as much as possible of what can be taken along with agricultural work at each period, such as a basket of manure to the fields, a basket of grass back home, a basket of fertilizer to the fields, and a basket of crops back home; plowing with a cart, a cart of manure to the fields, a cart of crops (or a cart of soil) back home. In this way, all 449 mu of corn, 60 mu of sweet potatoes, and 137 mu of millet in the team were transported home without a single large cart being assigned. This one item alone saved 300 labor workdays and 300 animal power workdays. Other examples include combining animal husbandry with feeding livestock, combining cooks with running the canteen and growing vegetables, and combining pig breeders with growing feed land and accumulating fertilizer. Because the various agricultural tasks have been cleverly combined, the team can save 2,200 laborers just by skillfully using troops.

Look Three Steps Ahead, Seize Opportunities Every Step of the Way

The growth and development of crops all have their different laws. Each crop has several "opportunities" in its growth process that are suitable for promoting its growth and development. One step earlier is early in everything, and every step is proactive; one step later is later in everything, and every step is passive, and will be "punished" by nature. The timeliness and delay of agricultural production have a great relationship with yield. According to the investigation in Huangtun, the difference in yield between timely and delayed plowing and sowing is 20%, and the difference in labor use is about 70%. In addition, it is also important to seize the "management" aspect early. According to the investigation of this team, the amount of labor used per mu differs by two to three times between timely and appropriate management, and the yield differs by 30%. In 1957, this team had 30 mu of late corn. Due to late management, grass weeds occurred, and one laborer could not hoe one mu in a day; while on land without grass weeds, one laborer could hoe three mu in a day, and the yield was 30% higher. After communization, the Party organization and the vast number of commune members of this team, relying on the superior conditions of the People's Commune, summarized the experience of fighting against nature for many years and learned lessons from the "punishment" of nature, thus grasping the laws of nature, that is, "seizing opportunities, grasping the four early, and striving for the initiative." The so-called four early are early autumn plowing, early sowing, early management, and early clearing of stubble. Every link is tightly linked, and no link is loosened. At the beginning of the wheat harvest this year, they scientifically matched labor, livestock, and tools into several teams. The whole team mobilized 90% of the able-bodied and semi-able-bodied men and women and 21 laborers who could participate in minor auxiliary labor. They adopted the method of people and animals going to the fields and taking wheat home, and concentrated animal power into summer sowing, making it possible to harvest one mu of wheat, plow one mu, and sow one mu. 95% of the 320 mu of wheat stubble were replanted (the replanting rate was 50% higher than in the past), which not only increased the replanting rate, but also completed it about ten days earlier than other surrounding teams. Because summer plowing was carried out before summer sowing, it brought convenience to seedling management, and no grass weeds occurred on the team's more than 1,200 mu of spring and late crops.

Opportunity is "yield," opportunity is "labor." According to the characteristics of spring drought, autumn floods, and poor soil stickiness, the Huangtun Production Team has made articles on seizing opportunities and grasping the early for several years, thus ensuring a continuous leap forward in production. For autumn plowing, there has been no bare stubble land for several years. This year, the team's 1,006 mu of autumn plowing tasks were generally plowed once by November 15, and 350 mu were plowed twice before the light snow. Every year, millet is sown as soon as the land thaws, which not only staggers the agricultural work, but also seizes the moisture to sow, making it easy to preserve the seedlings.

Implement the Party's Guidelines and Policies

The Party's guidelines and policies are not only the direction of all work, but also an important symbol for measuring the quality of all work; at the same time, they are also the driving force for promoting work. Practice has proved that once the Party's guidelines and policies are mastered by the masses, they will generate huge material strength. In the process of digging labor potential and improving labor efficiency, in addition to carefully and meticulously studying and mastering the laws and characteristics of agricultural work, thereby using labor scientifically, this team also especially emphasized doing a good job in the work of people, strengthening ideological education for commune members, and conscientiously implementing the Party's various policies. Therefore, it fully mobilized the production enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members.

The first is to do a good job in distribution in a timely manner. For several years, this team has embodied the Party's policy of more pay for more work and distribution according to work, ensuring that more than 90% of the commune members increase their income year by year. The distribution in previous years has focused on the following two aspects of work: first, correctly handle the withholding ratio. Although this team suffered serious disasters this year, it still ensured that the income of commune members was not lower than last year by compressing all non-productive expenditures and reducing non-productive labor. This year, the part used for the distribution of commune members accounted for 70% of the total income, and the part withheld accounted for 30%. The average income of commune members increased by about 30% compared with 1958. Second, the labor management system of evaluating work and recording points, quota management, and more pay for more work was implemented, so that the 50 commune members who had more attendance, high work efficiency, and were active in labor received due rewards, which encouraged the labor enthusiasm of the commune members. The average attendance of able-bodied, semi-able-bodied, and auxiliary laborers in the team throughout the year was 300 days, and the average number of labor days was 240, an increase of about 10% in work efficiency compared with last year.

Fully caring for the lives of commune members is also an indispensable important aspect of mobilizing the production enthusiasm of commune members. The Party branch of this team first earnestly ran the canteen well, ensuring that the commune members eat their fill, eat well, and save money. At the same time, it also paid special attention to combining work with rest. Throughout the year, except for the 20 days of the summer and autumn busy seasons, there were no more overtime rushes. At the same time, in order to ensure that commune members have a good rest, meetings were streamlined as much as possible, with large meetings being turned into small meetings and small meetings being turned into zero meetings. Evening meetings were changed to field meetings and field-side meetings. Even commune member meetings generally did not exceed two hours. In summer, in order to ensure the health of commune members, the system of going to the fields early in the morning, returning home early in the morning, going to the fields late in the afternoon, and returning home late was implemented to avoid heatstroke among commune members. A vacation system was implemented for commune members, and special protection was provided for female commune members.

In addition, the participation of cadres in labor also played a great role for commune members. The commune members of Huangtun reflected: "Our branch secretary and team leader, and all the cadres, do everything first, how can the commune members not do it?" The nine cadres of Huangtun, except for attending meetings, have been participating in production for several years. In addition to recording work according to the system for cadres attending meetings in the county and commune, no work is recorded for work delays due to other work. Cadres have no subsidy work and rely entirely on their own labor.

The methods adopted by this team in digging labor potential are multifaceted, and the achievements are also very outstanding. But has the labor potential been fully tapped? From the investigation, the potential is still great. The biggest potential is tool reform. Taking the inter-tillage tool as an example, the inter-tillage of crops alone uses 1,800 workdays throughout the year. If it is changed to a weeding hoe, the work efficiency will be increased by at least two times, so only 600 to 800 workdays will be needed. Taking fertilizer accumulation and capital construction as examples, if the fertilizer pits are built in the fields, not only will the fertilizer be increased, but also the labor used for pulling soil and sending fertilizer will be relatively reduced. Although this team tried to do as much as possible in the agricultural slack season for the labor used for pulling soil and sending fertilizer, and made full use of the method of taking it along the way to reduce the use of individual labor, the total number of labor used for pulling soil, accumulating fertilizer, and sending fertilizer still reached 1,037 this year. If the manure pits are built in the fields, at least one-quarter of the labor days can still be saved.

In short, the use of labor in a production unit, like a commander of a combat unit using troops, must embody Chairman Mao's strategic thinking in strategy and tactics. Scientific and meticulous layout and planning, a deep understanding of labor and agricultural work, understanding their characteristics, and mastering their laws are necessary to gain the initiative, be the master of nature, and improve labor efficiency at a higher level.

    一切要在巧字上作打算
    ——黄屯生产队使用劳力调查报告
    中共河北省深县县委书记处书记　王瑞朴
    当前农业战线上缺乏劳力的问题能不能解决？怎样解决？这是当前农业生产中一个极为重要的问题。摸清这个底，对于进一步贯彻执行党的大办农业、大办粮食和多种多收、高产多收的农业生产方针，有着极为重要的意义。为此，最近特地到小范公社黄屯生产队作了一次调查，初步找到了一些解决这个问题的线索。
    黄屯生产队位于深县的东南部，在历史上被称为“下四屯”之一（包括侯屯、李屯、吉屯），地势低洼，过去十年九涝，是一个人少地多、劳力弱、生产工具缺乏的村庄。全队一千三百八十三亩土地，二百三十三口人，男女整半劳力六十九个，老弱耕畜二十五头。每人平均耕地五点九四亩，比该社每人平均三亩高90％；每个劳力负担耕地二十亩，比该社每个劳力负担耕地十一点六亩高72％；每头牲口平均负担耕地五十五点三亩，比该社平均负担耕地五十亩高10％。并且全部是红壤土，不易耕种。然而从高级社特别是公社化以来，黄屯样样农活都比它的邻村提前十天到十五天完成。以今年三秋为例，种麦提前十五天，秋收提前十天，秋耕提前六天。从1957年以来，粮食生产年年上升。原因在哪里？支部书记尹金生告诉我们说：“要像用钱用物一样使用劳力，一切在巧字上作打算，就能‘一星管二’。”
    明确方向，狠抓重点
    根据我国国民经济发展以农业为基础的方针，必须把主要劳动力用在农业生产上。抓住“粮食”这条纲，就能促进其他事业的发展。从1958年大跃进、人民公社化以来，各项事业的发展出现了高潮。黄屯生产队党支部也曾试图各项工作来个“万马奔腾，齐头跃进”，计划建立缝纫厂、木厂、修配厂、化肥厂、养猪场、养羊场，发展多种经济，种藕、养鱼，加上后勤、水利，以及社办工业用工等，最少也得三十一人，占全队劳力总数的近半；而“八字宪法”的进一步贯彻，使农业用工量又增加了30％，劳力和生产的需要就产生了一个非常突出的矛盾。显然，这样作下去势必拉长战线，分散劳力，使农业生产的持续跃进受到影响。在这种情况下，支部反复学习了上级党的指示，分析了本队的特点是：地多劳力少，不能百业俱兴，必须贯彻“农业为本，粮食当先”的精神。在统一了干部、社员的思想之后，重新调整和安排了劳力，从1959年以来，始终保持了80％以上的劳力投入农业生产。今年投入农业的劳力达到了五十九人，占劳力总数的86.9％，投入农业的精壮劳力占80％。从用工上看，同样体现了以农业为基础的指导思想，今年共用一万九千二百七十九个工，其中农业用工一万五千八百三十二个，占全年各项事业用工的82.11％。从干部力量上看，全村三个支部委员有两个抓农业，全村十六名党团员有十四名安排在农业生产战线，从而保证了农业战线上的优势力量。
    农活合理布局
    农活布局是全年农业生产的一个战略问题，也是合理使用劳力的基础。农活安排得好，就能发挥全体劳动力的积极作用，使每个劳力都各尽其能、各显其才，有效地调节农活繁多和劳力不足的矛盾。反之，一环布局不当，就会造成农活多少悬殊，劳力忙闲不均，在紧要关头失去战机，牵动全局，违误农时，造成被动。所以农活布局也必须要“巧”。黄屯生产队的农活布局巧在什么地方呢？一是农杂活都集中在农闲时期干，使农闲为农忙赶工；二是在作物配置安排茬口上，按着各种作物下种和成熟的时间合理搭配，尽量分散田间管理的农活，平衡忙闲季节的农活，缩短休闲时间和突击时间，延长正常的劳动时间；三是合理设置农田基本建设工程，节约劳力，减少用工。
    去年三秋工作刚一结束，他们就把今年的各项农活算了一笔账，全年共需用工一万九千二百七十九个。但是，把全村能干点活的人都动员起来，按最高出勤率计算，最多也不过作一万七千个左右的劳动日。为了解决这个问题，他们把全年的农杂活全部利用春前秋后和冬闲时间去作。如春播的用肥，去冬就全部运到了地里，结合送粪拉回垫脚土一千三百多车，够全年使用。铡草也集中到农闲干。往年两口铡刀，占住四个人，在大忙时期不能下地生产；去年改变了办法，利用冬闲时期一下就铡了一百三十六万多斤，够所有牲口吃一年，为大忙时期省出七百二十个工。仅打坯、铡草、拉土、送粪等几项主要农活提前做，就为大忙时期赶出二千七百多个工，有效地调节了劳力和农活之间的矛盾。
    但是，农活最多最集中的时期，是夏秋大忙时期，光农闲赶工不能解决全部问题。往年夏忙一开始，收麦、打场、送肥、夏耕、夏种、夏锄都挤在一起了，稍有疏忽，不是荒地就是不能适时播种，影响生产。三秋农活份量更大，收割播种同时开始，秋耕又必须抓紧进行，否则保不住墒，影响来年播种，就会给全年农业生产造成被动。过去这村仅6、7、9、10四个月，就需用工七千九百七十五个，占全年出工数的52％，而根据往年情况，这个时期最高出工数也不过六千零四十个工，相差一千九百三十五个。以麦收为例，从6月6日开始收割到完成夏种，不能超过半月。同时在这短短时间里，又要完成打场、送粪、耕地和春苗的中耕锄草等。按这个要求计算，需用一千七百三十二个劳力工和三百八十六个畜力工，但全队最高出工数也不过一千二百个劳力工和三百七十五个畜力工。他们解决这个问题的办法是：首先在作物配置上，把成熟早和成熟晚的品种适当搭配，这样就把一部分农活从耕种管理到收割入仓有计划地提前和错后，避免了中期农活挤堆的现象。去年种的三百二十亩小麦中，就种了二百亩成熟期早五天的“平原50”，又加上他们把夏种的肥料在收麦以前就送到了地头。这样，在夏忙高潮以前就作好了七百五十个劳力工和一百二十八个畜力工，给夏收夏种腾开了手脚。在三秋和为明年丰收的准备工作中，也采取了同样的方法，解决了矛盾，争得了主动。
    使用劳力在于巧
    在以农业为基础的方针指导下，如果说从各个战线上调兵遣将，集中力量和作好全年生产的布局是一个战略性问题，那么在一项具体农活上的用兵就是战术问题。当然，战略问题处理得好，就为全面胜利奠定了基础，提供了前提；可是一个战术上的问题处理不好，又往往影响着全局的胜利。根据党中央大办农业、大办粮食的方针，农业“八字宪法”必须在更高的水平上来贯彻，农业用工量大大增加，而目前我们的机械化程度还不高，劳动工时的延长又有一定限制。因此，在劳动力使用上，就必须贯彻毛主席的军事战略思想，“巧用兵”、“以一当十”，用同样的时间、同样的工具、同样的劳力作出较多的活计。他们的具体办法是：
    （一）在统一计划、全面安排的情况下，量才使用，因人给活，因活派工。为了不浪费一个劳动力，在派活上执行了十派十不派，即：人少能作的活不派多人去作，该派半劳力的活不派整劳力，该派辅助劳力的活不派半劳力，该派女劳力的活不派男劳力，该派弱劳力的活不派壮劳力，该派一头牲口的活不派两头牲口，该用一个工序的不用两个工序，能结合干的活不单派劳力，该派技术高的人干的活不派技术低的，该用零星时间干的活不占用整时间。
    （二）强弱结合，流水作业，配套成龙。庄稼活种类繁多，各有其特点，而农活有轻有重，有强有弱，技术有高有低，两者巧配就能达到事半功倍的效果。他们配套的形式很多，因作物特点不同而战术有别。
    （三）一人多艺，一专多能，连环配套，相互挂钩。对每个时期的农活能捎带的尽量捎带，如下地一筐粪，回家一筐草，下地一筐肥，回家一筐庄稼；耕地套车，下地一车粪，回家一车庄稼（或一车土）。这样一来，全队四百四十九亩玉米、六十亩红薯、一百三十七亩谷子，没单套大车就运回家来。仅这一项捎脚就节省了三百个劳力工和三百个畜力工。其它，如牲口使役结合喂牲口，炊事员结合搞食堂种菜，猪只饲养员结合种饲料地、积肥等。由于各项农活作到了巧结合，仅巧用兵一项全队就可节省劳动力二千二百个。
    早看三步棋，步步抢时机
    农作物生长发育都有其不同的规律。每一种作物在其生长过程中，都有几个适宜于促进其生长发育的“时机”。一步抓早了就一早百早，步步主动；一步迟了就步步迟，节节被动，受到自然的“惩罚”。农业生产的及时和失时，对产量关系很大。从黄屯的调查看，耕与种这两步及时与失时，产量就相差20％，用工量相差70％左右。此外，“管”字这一关抓早了也很重要。据这个队调查，管的及时与适时，每亩用工量相差二倍至三倍，而产量相差30％。1957年，这队有三十亩晚玉米，由于管的晚发生了草荒，一个劳力一天锄不了一亩；而没草荒的地，一个劳力一天锄三亩，而且产量还高30％。这个队的党组织和广大社员在公社化以后，依靠人民公社的优越条件，总结了多年来同自然斗争的经验，从历次自然的“惩罚”中取得了教训，从而抓住了自然规律，就是“抢时机、抓四早、争取主动”。所谓四早，即早秋耕，早播种，早管理，早腾茬。环环扣紧，一环不松，一着不让。今年收麦开始，他们即将劳、畜、工具科学地搭配成了几套班子，全队把90％的男女整半劳力和二十一个能参加轻微辅助劳动的劳力全部动员起来，采用人畜下地回家捎麦的方法，集中畜力投入夏种，作到了麦子收一亩，耕一亩，种一亩，三百二十亩麦茬，95％进行了复种（复种率比过去提高了50％），不仅提高了复种率，而且比周围其他队早完成十天左右。由于夏种前进行了夏耕，给幼苗管理带来了方便，全队一千二百多亩春晚作物未发生草荒。
    时机就是“产量”，时机就是“劳力”。黄屯生产队根据春旱、秋涝、土粘性劣的特点，几年来从抓早、抓时机上作文章，从而保证了生产持续跃进。秋耕几年来不留白茬地，今年全队一千零六亩秋耕任务，在11月15日已普耕一遍，到小雪前有三百五十亩耕了两遍。每年的谷子也都是地一解冻就播，这样不仅错开了农活，而且抢墒播种，容易保全苗。
    贯彻执行党的方针政策
    党的方针政策既是一切工作的方向，又是衡量一切工作质量的重要标志；同时，也是推动工作前进的动力。实践证明，党的方针政策一旦被群众所掌握，就会产生巨大的物质力量。这个队在大挖劳动潜力、提高劳动效率的过程中，除了认真细致地研究掌握农活规律、特点，从而科学使用劳力外，还特别强调了作好人的工作，对社员加强了思想教育，切实贯彻执行了党的各项政策，因而，充分调动了广大社员的生产积极性。
    首先是及时作好分配。几年来这个队一直体现了党的多劳多得、按劳分配的政策，保证了90％以上的社员逐年增加收入。历年的分配抓住了以下两方面的工作：第一，是正确处理扣留比例。今年这个队虽然遭受了严重灾害，但是通过压缩一切非生产性开支，减少非生产用工，仍保证了社员的收入不低于去年。今年用于社员分配的部分占总收入的70％，扣留部分占30％，社员平均比1958年增加收入30％左右。第二，是贯彻执行了评工记分、定额管理、多劳多得的劳动管理制度，使出勤多、工效高、劳动积极的五十名社员得到了应有奖励，鼓舞了社员的劳动热情。全队男女整半辅助劳力，全年平均出勤三百天，平均做劳动日二百四十个，比去年提高工效10％左右。
    全面关心社员生活，也是调动社员生产积极性不可缺少的重要方面。这个队的党支部首先切实办好了食堂，保证了社员吃饱吃好又节约以外，同时还特别注意劳逸结合。全年除夏秋两个大忙季节的二十来天外，再没有过加班突击。同时为了使社员休息好，尽量精简了会议，往往大会化小，小会化零，改晚上开会为田头开、场边开，即是社员大会也一般不超过两小时。夏天为了保证社员身体健康，实行了早晨早下地、上午早回家，下午晚下地、晚回家，避免了社员中暑。并对社员执行了放假制度和做到了对女社员的特殊保护。
    此外，干部参加劳动对社员也起到了很大作用。黄屯的社员反映说：“我们的支书、队长各个干部事事干在头里，社员那肯不干呢？”黄屯的九个干部，几年来除开会以外，都是参加生产。干部除了到县、社开会按制度记工外，因其他工作误工都不记，干部没有补贴工，完全依靠自己劳动。
    这个队在挖掘劳动潜力上采取的方法是多方面的，成绩也很突出，但是劳动潜力是否挖尽了呢？从调查中来看，潜力还很大，最大的潜力是工具改革。以中耕工具为例，全年仅作物中耕就用工一千八百个，如果改为耘锄，工效最少提高两倍，那么只用六百个到八百个工就可以了。再以积肥、基本建设为例，如果把肥坑建在田间，不仅会增加肥料，而且相对减少拉土、送肥的用工。这队虽然在拉土、送肥用工尽量赶在农闲，并充分利用了捎带办法，减少了单独用工，但今年拉土、积肥、送肥，用工总数仍达到了一千零三十七个，如果粪坑建在田间，至少还可以节省四分之一左右的劳动日。
    总之，一个生产单位的使用劳力，像一个作战单位的指挥员使用兵力一样，在战略、战术上，必须体现毛主席的战略思想。科学细致的布局、谋划，对劳力和农活必须深知甚解，了解其特点，掌握其规律，只有这样，才能取得主动权，作大自然的主人，也才能更高地提高劳动效率。
