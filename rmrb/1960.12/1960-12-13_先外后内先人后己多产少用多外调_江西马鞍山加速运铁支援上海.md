Ma'anshan, Jiangxi Accelerates Iron Transport to Support Shanghai

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, December 12th: Jiangxi Province, in the spirit of "the whole country as one chessboard," "prioritizes external needs, then internal needs, prioritizes others, then self," producing, transporting, and quickly transporting good iron to support Shanghai's steelmaking. As of December 10th, the province has completed 97% of its annual pig iron external transfer plan. All staff on the province's iron and steel front and transportation front are adopting various concrete measures and striving with full confidence to complete the annual pig iron external transfer plan ahead of schedule and exceed the target.

In order to fully support Shanghai's steelmaking, the Provincial Party Committee's Iron and Steel Leading Group and the Iron and Steel Coal Transfer Command have strengthened leadership over the external transfer of pig iron, organized working groups to go deep into the front lines of production and transfer, and supervised and inspected the production and transfer of pig iron. Recently, the province has also transferred one hundred trucks and some fleets to strengthen the transportation capacity for external transfer of pig iron, accelerating the speed of transfer.

All iron and steel plants are adopting the method of producing, testing, concentrating, and transporting simultaneously, and are minimizing the enterprise's own iron consumption, transferring more good iron to Shanghai as quickly as possible. Jishui County has transferred all pig iron accumulated in docks and iron plants. Thanks to effective measures taken in various places, 7,000 tons were transferred in early December, and the transfer progress is increasing daily.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, December 12th: Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company in Anhui concentrates its efforts on producing more good iron and transferring more good iron to supply Shanghai to increase the production of good steel. In the first eleven months of this year, Ma'gang's total transfer of pig iron to Shanghai increased by 51.8% compared with the same period last year. In the first week of December, the pig iron transferred to Shanghai increased by another 16.7% compared with the same period last month.

Recently, the iron and steel workers of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company have enthusiastically launched a labor competition centered on producing more iron, using less iron, and transferring more iron. The workers of the three major ironmaking plants used the "three-way combination" method to break through various key production aspects such as raw material management and technical operation one by one, further increasing the output of blast furnaces. From December 1st to 8th, the company's pig iron output increased by an average of more than 330 tons per day compared with the same period last month, while ensuring quality. Steelmaking workers also implemented pig iron metering into the furnace, doing everything possible to reduce iron consumption and save pig iron for external transfer.

The company also adopted the method of minimizing its own iron consumption, striving to transfer as much iron as it produces. Xiangshan Iron and Steel Plant originally planned to use a batch of pig iron for its own use, but after the plant leaders and workers studied it together, they believed that it was not urgently needed at present, and voluntarily loaded all the pig iron onto trucks and transported it to Shanghai.

The transportation department of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company actively cooperates with sales and production units, prioritizing the supply of vehicles according to needs. The supply and marketing department organizes personnel to go to the pig iron warehouse and loading site to understand the source of goods and specifically arrange consignment plans, ensuring immediate transportation upon production. The main leading cadres of the CPC Ma'anshan Municipal Committee and the company also go deep into the site to command and inspect the work of external transfer of pig iron.

    先外后内先人后己多产少用多外调
    江西马鞍山加速运铁支援上海
    新华社南昌12日电　江西省本着“全国一盘棋”的精神，“先外后内、先人后己”，多产、多运、快运好铁，支援上海炼钢。截至12月10日止，全省已完成全年生铁外调计划的97％。全省钢铁战线和运输战线的全体职工，正在采取各种具体措施，满怀信心地争取提前超额完成全年生铁外调计划。
    为了全力支援上海炼钢，省委钢铁领导小组和钢铁煤调运指挥部，加强了生铁外调工作的领导，组织工作组深入生产和调运第一线，督促检查生铁的生产和调运工作。最近全省又抽调了一百部汽车和一些船队，加强外调生铁的运输力量，加快了调运生铁的速度。
    各钢铁厂都采取边生产、边化验、边集中、边运输的办法，并尽量减少企业自用铁，把更多的好铁尽快地调往上海。吉水县已将所有码头、铁厂积压的生铁全部外调。各地由于采取了有效的措施，12月上旬就外调了七千吨，而且调运进度还在日益上升。
    据新华社合肥12日电　安徽马鞍山钢铁公司集中力量多产好铁，多调好铁，供应上海增产好钢。马钢今年前十一个月已调上海的生铁总量比去年同期增长51.8％，12月第一周调往上海的生铁比上月同期又增长16.7％。
    最近，马鞍山钢铁公司的钢铁职工，热烈地展开了以多产铁、少用铁、多调铁为中心的劳动竞赛。三大炼铁厂职工，用“三结合”的办法，一个一个地突破了原料管理、技术操作等各个生产关键，促使高炉产量进一步提高。12月份1至8日，全公司生铁产量和上月同期比较，平均每天多产三百三十多吨铁，并保证了质量。炼钢职工也实行铁水计量入炉，千方百计降低铁耗，节省出生铁外调。
    这个公司还采取尽量减少自用铁的办法，力争做到增产多少铁，外调多少铁。向山钢铁厂原来准备自用的一批生铁，经厂领导和工人一起研究，认为目前并非急需，便主动将这批生铁全部装车运往上海。
    马鞍山钢铁公司运输部门主动与销售、生产单位协作，按照需要优先供应车辆。供销部门组织人员到生铁库、装车现场，了解货源，具体安排托运计划，做到随产随运。中共马鞍山市委和公司的主要领导干部，也深入现场指挥、检查外调生铁的工作。
