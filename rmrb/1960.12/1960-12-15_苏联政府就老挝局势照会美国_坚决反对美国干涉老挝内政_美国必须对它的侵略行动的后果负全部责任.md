Xinhua News Agency, December 14th: TASS, Moscow, December 13th: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vasily Kuznetsov received U.S. Ambassador to Moscow Thompson on December 13th and handed him a note from the Soviet government to the U.S. government regarding the situation in Laos.

The full text of the note is as follows:

"The Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics deems it necessary to make the following statement to the Government of the United States.

In a statement issued on September 22nd this year regarding the situation in Laos, the Soviet Government drew attention to the fact that a serious threat to peace had arisen in this region of Southeast Asia due to the unbridled interference of the United States and some of its partners in the aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in the internal affairs of Laos. Two or three months ago, the United States government was still trying to disguise its illegal activities in Laos, but recently, the United States has actually directly participated in the military operations of the rebels against the legitimate government of Laos and the Lao people.

The United States has trampled on the sovereignty of the Lao government headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma and is now openly supporting the Nosavan rebel group, supplying it with weapons, military technical equipment, ammunition, and money. The rebels are equipped with weapons unprecedented in the Lao army: 105mm howitzers, 120mm mortars, heavy tanks, military aircraft, helicopters, armored speedboats, and other equipment.

The United States government has consistently sent many American advisors and trainers to the rebel camps, training them in the use of these weapons. In addition, near the town of North Cadin, government forces shot down an '830-type' reconnaissance plane with four American officers on board. During the fighting between government forces and the rebels, American 'Sikorsky' helicopters regularly took off from Thai territory to correct the rebels' artillery fire.

This shows that American military advisors and trainers not only train the rebels but also directly lead their combat operations against the troops of the legitimate government of Laos. The United States government is also making extensive use of its Southeast Asian military bloc ally, Thailand, which provides its territory for conducting rampant military operations against government forces and imposes a brutal economic blockade on Laos.

The facts show that the United States government completely disregards the repeated appeals of the legitimate government of Prince Souvanna Phouma and its official request in its statement of December 5th this year that the United States stop supplying weapons and ammunition to the rebels.

All of this is a serious violation by the United States government of Article 12 of the Final Declaration of the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina. Article 12 of the Declaration stipulates that each participant of the aforementioned conference, including the United States, has the following obligation: to respect the sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity of Laos, and not to interfere in any way in the internal affairs of Laos.

The United States government is openly opposing the legitimate government of Prince Souvanna Phouma of Laos, which has declared a policy of peace, neutrality, and national unity as its program, and is attempting through this action to force the Lao people to abandon the path they have chosen and once again make Laos serve military blocs and policies of aggressive preparation that are incompatible with the Lao people.

However, it is worth mentioning that this policy has already once failed in Laos. The Lao people overthrew the government that pursued a policy of turning Laos into an American military base and semi-colony. The Lao people hope to finally end the civil war and achieve national unity without any foreign interference; it is impossible to obstruct their legitimate desire.

As a participant and one of the chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina, the Soviet government firmly opposes U.S. interference in the internal affairs of Laos and condemns this interference. This interference violates the Geneva Accords and aims to oppose the freedom and independence of the Lao people, and their inalienable right to pursue a policy of peace, neutrality, and friendship with all nations.

The Soviet government cannot remain indifferent to the threat to peace and security in Southeast Asia resulting from the United States' blatant interference in the internal affairs of Laos; the Soviet government believes that the United States government must bear full responsibility for the possible consequences of the aggressive actions taken by the United States and some of its allies in the Southeast Asia military bloc against the Lao people. Moscow, December 13, 1960."

Ambassador Thompson said he would forward the note to his government.

### 苏联政府就老挝局势照会美国  坚决反对美国干涉老挝内政  美国必须对它的侵略行动的后果负全部责任

    苏联政府就老挝局势照会美国
    坚决反对美国干涉老挝内政
    美国必须对它的侵略行动的后果负全部责任
    新华社14日讯　塔斯社莫斯科13日讯：苏联外交部第一副部长库兹?佐夫在12月13日接见了美国驻莫斯科大使汤普森，并把苏联政府就老挝局势给美国政府的一份照会交给了他。
    上述照会全文如下：
    “苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府认为有必要向美国政府作如下的声明。
    苏联政府在今年9月22日关于老挝局势的一项声明中曾经提醒注意，由于美国及其东南亚条约组织侵略集团中某些伙伴对老挝内政的肆无忌惮的干涉，在东南亚的这一地区形成了对和平的严重威胁。两三个月以前，美国政府还企图设法把它在老挝的非法活动伪装起来，而最近，美国实际上直接参加了叛乱分子对老挝合法政府和老挝人民的军事行动。
    美国蹂躏了以富马亲王为首的老挝政府的主权，现在又公开支持诺萨万叛乱集团，供给它武器、军事技术装备、弹药和金钱。叛军用老挝军队前所未有的武器装备起来了：一○五毫米的榴弹炮、一二○毫米的迫击炮、重型坦克、军用飞机、直升飞机、装甲快艇和其他装备。
    美国政府过去和现在不断派遣许多美国顾问和教练员到叛乱分子的军营中，训练他们使用这些武器。此外，在北卡定城附近，政府军队打下了一架‘八三○式’侦察飞机，飞机上有四个美国军官。在政府军队同叛乱分子进行战斗期间，美国‘西考斯基式’直升飞机定期从泰国领土上起飞，校正叛乱分子的大炮的火力。
    由此可见，美国军事顾问和教练员不仅训练叛乱分子，而且直接领导他们的战斗行动去反对老挝合法政府的军队。美国政府还广泛利用它的东南亚军事集团盟国泰国；后者提供它的领土供对政府军队采取猖狂的军事行动之用，并对老挝实行残酷的经济封锁。
    事实说明，美国政府完全无视富马亲王合法政府不止一次发出的呼吁和它在今年12月5日的声明中提出的要美国停止向叛乱分子供应武器弹药的正式要求。
    所有这一切都是美国政府对1954年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议最后宣言第十二条的严重破坏。宣言的第十二条规定，上述会议的每一个参加者，其中包括美国，负有下列义务：尊重老挝的主权、独立、统一和领土完整，不得对老挝的内政进行任何干涉。
    美国政府公然反对宣布和平、中立和民族团结的政策为自己纲领的老挝富马亲王合法政府，企图用这种行动迫使老挝人民离开他们所选择的道路，重新使老挝为同老挝人民格格不入的军事集团和侵略准备政策服务。
    但是，值得一提的是，这种政策已经一度在老挝遭到了失败。老挝人民推翻了那个执行变老挝为美国军事基地和半殖民地的政策的政府。老挝人民希望最终停止内战和在没有任何外国干涉的情况下实现民族团结；要阻挠他们的这一合法愿望，那是办不到的。
    作为关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的参加者和主席之一，苏联政府坚决反对美国干涉老挝内政，并谴责这一干涉。这种干涉破坏了日内瓦协议，其目的是要反对老挝人民的自由和独立，反对他们执行和平、中立和同各国人民友好的政策这一不可剥夺的权利。
    苏联政府不能对由于美国粗暴干涉老挝内政而在东南亚产生的对和平与安全的威胁漠然视之；苏联政府认为，美国政府要对美国及其东南亚军事集团的某些盟国对老挝人民采取的侵略行动所可能产生的后果负全部责任。　1960年12月13日于莫斯科”
    汤普森大使说，他将把照会转交自己的政府。
