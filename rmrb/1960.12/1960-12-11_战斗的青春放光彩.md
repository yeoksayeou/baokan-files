Three bright flowers bloom towards the sun,
Three trees are planted against the wind,
Three sisters on one boat,
Constantly travel to and from the East Sea front.

The youngest sister loves to dance and sing,
A plum blossom blooming under the artillery fire:
She was left to support the front line at sea,
Pouting her little mouth and shouting bad luck!

The sisters row the boat to the heart of the sea,
Singing flies under the deck!
Lift the deck and look –
Ah? What is it?
The youngest sister jumps out from under the deck!

"Eldest sister, second sister, come and see:
That little sea eagle,
Can fly high against the wind and waves!"
Ai Hai Yo!
The youngest sister is only fifteen years old this year,
She has supported the front line under artillery fire thousands of times!

The second sister is an experienced woman boatman,
Weaving through the waves and clouds:
That day she shouted that there was a situation,
And jumped into the sea holding up a shark hook!

Only the sound of the sea rushing,
Waves hitting the boat!
The second sister got on the boat –
Sisters!
Pull hard!
The shark hook hooked a "water ghost"!

"Eldest sister, youngest sister, don't be surprised,
Just now I saw bubbles coming up here,
So I knew this 'shark' was coming to sabotage!"
Ai Hai Yo!
With a clear mind and quick hands and feet,
The second sister's courage is greater than the East Sea!

Our eldest sister is like a piece of steel,
With both strength and tenderness:
Usually, she speaks in a soft voice,
But that day she spoke like thunder!

Shaking the East Sea with a thousand-foot wave,
Shaking the enemy so they couldn't lift their heads!
The cannon is hard to open its mouth—
Ah? What is it!
She is our gunner!

The three sisters, valiantly,
The women of the new China are so proud,
Beating the plague god and making him run away with his tail between his legs!
Ai Hai Yo!
Raising the anti-imperialist banner high,
The three sisters fought bravely together!

Three bright flowers bloom towards the sun,
Three trees are planted against the wind,
Production and fighting are leaping forward together,
The sisters are growing up in the artillery fire,
New era, new women,
The radiance of fighting youth!

    战斗的青春放光彩
    张永枚
    三朵鲜花向阳开，
    三棵树儿迎风栽，
    一条船上三姐妹，
    东海前线常往来。
    爱跳爱唱是小三妹，
    炮火下开出一枝梅：
    海上支援前线留下她，
    噘起小嘴喊倒霉！
    姐妹们划船到海心，
    船舱底下歌声飞！
    揭开船板看——
    啊？啥呀？
    舱底下跳出个小三妹！
    “大姐二姐你来看：
    那一只海鹰虽然小，
    她迎着风浪能高飞！”
    哎嗨哟！
    小妹今年刚满十五岁，
    炮火下支援前线上千回！
    二姐本是个女老?，
    浪里穿梭云里来：
    那天她喊声有情况，
    高举鲨鱼钩跳下海！
    只听海水哗啦啦响，
    浪头打到船上来！
    二姐上了船——
    姐妹们！
    用力拉呀！
    鲨鱼钩钓起个“水鬼”来！
    “大姐三妹别奇怪，
    刚才我见这儿直冒泡，
    就知这‘鲨鱼’要来破坏！”
    哎嗨哟！
    心明眼亮手脚快，
    二姐的胆量大过东海！
    咱们的大姐像块钢，
    又有硬来又有柔：
    平时讲话嗓门细，
    那一天讲话如雷吼！
    震得东海千尺浪，
    震得敌人抬不起头！
    大炮难开口——
    啊？啥呀！
    她是咱们的一炮手！
    三姐妹，雄赳赳，
    新中国的妇女多自豪，
    打得那瘟神夹着尾巴就逃走！
    哎嗨哟！
    反帝的大旗高高举，
    三姐妹一齐奋勇战斗！
    三朵鲜花向阳开，
    三棵树儿迎风栽，
    生产战斗双跃进，
    姐妹们在炮火中成长起来，
    新的时代新妇女，
    战斗的青春放光彩！
