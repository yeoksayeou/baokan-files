Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 13th: According to a broadcast today by the Lao Fighting Forces Radio, Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front, sent a telegram to Prince Souvanna Phouma, Prime Minister of the Lao Royal Government, currently in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, reaffirming his support for the legitimate government headed by him.

The telegram said, "Having learned that you and some ministers of the government recently left Vientiane for Phnom Penh due to the tense situation created by the U.S. imperialist lackey, the Phoumi Nosavan clique, in the capital and the country, I believe that the Lao Patriotic Front needs to once again reaffirm the Lao Patriotic Front and the Lao people's support for the government headed by you."

The telegram said, "The government headed by you is the only legitimate government, a government that implements a policy of peace, neutrality, and national harmony in line with the wishes of the Lao people. I earnestly hope that, in the current situation in Laos, you will continue to fulfill the country's mission, and call on the governments and public opinion of all peace-loving countries to support Laos' policy of peace and neutrality, and oppose blatant foreign interference."

The telegram said, "Currently, the U.S. imperialist lackey, the Phoumi Nosavan clique, and Thai reactionaries are preparing to create bloodshed in our beloved capital, attempting to stifle our people's struggle. They are also preparing to overthrow the legitimate government and establish a puppet government of U.S. imperialist lackeys. The Lao people will unite as one and fight to the end. The Lao people and the Lao Patriotic Front have consistently believed that the government headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma is the only legitimate government. We firmly believe that our people's just struggle to defend the King, defend the Constitution, and strive for Laos' peace, neutrality, independence, unity, and prosperity will surely be victorious."

The telegram concluded, "I earnestly invite you and the ministers of the government to return to Sam Neua at this time of tension in the capital, in order to lead the people and administer state affairs."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 12th: Vientiane dispatch: On December 8th, Captain Kong Le's soldiers crushed the rebellion launched in Vientiane that day by a handful of Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak traitorous clique elements, supported by the United States, and led by Kouprasith Abhay. On the 9th, Prime Minister Phouma and some ministers left Vientiane by plane and arrived in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia. Several ministers, including Minister of Propaganda Quinim Pholsena, remain in Vientiane to continue performing the duties of the Phouma government.

Prior to this, according to a broadcast by Vientiane Radio on the 10th, Phouma had authorized the formation of a Supreme Military Committee, chaired by Chief of Staff Sounthone Pathammavong, to "lead all the work of the country." On the 11th, the chairman of the Supreme Military Committee returned the military and political power to the Phouma government.

According to a broadcast by this radio station on the 10th, the Lao Royal Army led by Captain Kong Le is entrusted with the responsibility of defending Vientiane and its surrounding areas. Captain Kong Le has called on all the people to help the Royal Army maintain the security and order of Vientiane, and to be vigilant against the enemy's sabotage plots.

It is reported that the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique, under the instructions of U.S. imperialism, while piecing together a puppet "government" in Savannakhet by gathering traitors, is also gathering troops around Vientiane with the vigorous support of U.S. imperialism, attempting to attack Vientiane and subvert the Phouma government.

    电报说，“目前，美帝国主义走狗富米·诺萨万集团和泰国反动分子，准备在我们可爱的首都制造流血事件，妄图窒息我们人民的斗争。它们还在准备推翻合法政府，成立美帝国主义走狗的傀儡政府。老挝人民将一致团结斗争到底。老挝人民和老挝爱国战线党始终如一地认为，以梭发那·富马亲王为首的政府，是唯一合法的政府。我们坚信，我们人民进行的以保卫国王，保卫宪法，争取老挝的和平中立、独立、统一和繁荣的正义斗争，一定会取得胜利。”
