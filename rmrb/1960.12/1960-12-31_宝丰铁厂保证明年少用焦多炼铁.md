Baofeng Iron Plant in Anze, Shanxi Province, is adopting a combination of top-down and bottom-up methods to summarize advanced experiences in saving coal and coke in preparation for "using less coal and producing more iron" next year. The Party Committee of this plant recently held an experience exchange meeting on saving coke and reducing costs in the Beiping Smelting Workshop, systematically summarizing and promoting the advanced experiences of the Beiping Smelting Workshop in saving coal, coke, manpower, and machine oil, and reducing costs. Because the Beiping Smelting Workshop comprehensively focused on conservation, promoting increased production through conservation, the amount of coal and coke used for ironmaking has been continuously reduced this year. The cost of each ton of pig iron has been reduced to 144 yuan, a decrease of 29.2% compared with the same period last year, and 16.24% lower than the state plan.
