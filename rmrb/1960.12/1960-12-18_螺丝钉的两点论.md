People often associate screws with the concept of "small." A small screw is only a few centimeters or a decimeter long, weighs very little, and occupies a negligible space on a large machine. It is indeed small.

However, it also has another aspect: it is an indispensable part of the large machine, the host machine. A 1,500 kW steam turbine requires approximately 4,000 screws; without these screws, the turbine cannot rotate. Airplanes cannot fly freely in the sky without the necessary screws; cars cannot speed across the land without the necessary screws; ships cannot brave the waves on the ocean without the necessary screws... In short, the screw is an indispensable thing.

One point is "small," and the other point is "indispensable." This is the two-point theory regarding the screw. Many factory cadres and worker comrades have grasped this two-point theory in their understanding of the screw. The Shanghai Non-Ferrous Metal Screw Factory is a small alley factory with only seventy-odd workers. The workers of this factory have established the idea that "large machines cannot do without small screws." First, they call screws "small screws," acknowledging that screws are "small"; second, they believe that large machines "cannot do without small screws," or, in their other words, "the protagonist is important, but the supporting cast is indispensable." Precisely because they have grasped this two-point theory, they are happy to be enterprising "screws" in the socialist construction of the motherland, doing everything possible in the production of screws to achieve: "Whatever the host machine needs, we make; how much is needed, we give; when it is needed, we give." To meet the needs of key products such as motors, instruments, and telecommunications equipment, the factory's screw production in November this year increased four and a half times compared to May this year. The facts of this factory tell us that a correct understanding of the screw generates a correct attitude towards the screw.

There are also some comrades who now think that screws are "insignificant." They do not value or are unwilling to engage in the production of screws. Why? It is because these comrades have adopted a one-point theory towards screws. They only see the "small" point of the screw and do not see the "indispensable" point of the screw. Although some of them verbally acknowledge that screws are "indispensable," because they do not truly understand this point, they are still, in effect, one-point theorists. It is obviously one-sided to see only one point when there are two points, and naturally, mistakes will be made.

Screws on machines have two points, and other "screws" in other areas also have these two points. In his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," Chairman Mao, when discussing the relationship between the Party's literary and artistic work and the Party's entire work, said: "Revolutionary literature and art are part of the entire revolutionary cause, they are gears and screws. Compared with other, more important parts, there is naturally a distinction between the light and heavy, the first and second, but they are indispensable gears and screws for the entire machine, an indispensable part of the entire revolutionary cause." On the large machine of our socialist construction, there are many "screws." They are "small," but they are indispensable. We must grasp this two-point theory. We should be happy to be a "screw," and we must be determined to be an enterprising "screw"!

    螺丝钉的两点论
    曹宪文
    人们往往把螺丝钉和“小”这个概念联系在一块儿。一颗小螺丝钉，只有几分长、寸把长，分量也很轻，在一部大机器身上占的地方又微乎其微。的确是小。
    但是，它还有另外一面，这就是：它对大机器、主机来说，又是不可缺少的一部分。一台一千五百瓩的汽轮机，大约就要有四千个螺丝钉；没有这些螺丝钉，汽轮机就不能转动。飞机少了必要的螺丝钉，就不能在天空上自由飞翔；汽车少了必要的螺丝钉，就不能在陆路上风驰电掣；轮船少了必要的螺丝钉，就不能在海洋上乘风破浪……。总而言之，螺丝钉是一个不可缺少的东西。
    一点是“小”，一点是“不可缺少”，这就是关于螺丝钉的两点论。我们许多工厂干部和工人同志，对螺丝钉的认识，是掌握了这个两点论的。上海有色金属螺丝厂，是一家只有七十多个工人的弄堂小厂，这个厂的工人就树立了一种“大机器离不开小螺钉”的思想。第一，他们把螺丝钉叫做“小螺丝钉”，承认螺丝钉是“小”的；第二，他们又认为大机器是“离不开小螺丝钉”的，或者用他们另外的一句话来说，就是：“主角虽重要，龙套不可少”。正因为他们掌握了这个两点论，所以他们就乐于在祖国的社会主义建设中做一个奋发有为的“螺丝钉”，在螺丝钉的生产上千方百计地做到了：“主机需要什么，就做什么；要多少，给多少；什么时候要，什么时候给”。为了满足电机、仪表、电讯设备等重点产品的需要，这个厂今年十一月份的螺丝产量就比今年五月份提高了四倍半。这个厂的事实告诉我们，对螺丝钉的正确认识，就产生了对螺丝钉的正确态度。
    现在也有一些同志，认为螺丝钉是“微不足道”的，他们不重视或者不愿搞螺丝钉的生产。为什么？就是因为这些同志对螺丝钉采取了一点论，他们只看到螺丝钉“小”的这一点，而看不到螺丝钉“不可缺少”的那一点。虽然其中有些人口头上也讲螺丝钉“不可缺少”这一点，但由于他们并没有真正懂得这一点，所以他们实际上也还是一点论者。明明有两点，而只看到一点，当然是片面的，这样自然就会犯错误。
    机器上的螺丝钉有两点，其他方面的“螺丝钉”，其实也都有这两点。毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中，谈到党的文艺工作和党的整个工作的关系问题的时候，就这样说过：“革命文艺是整个革命事业的一部分，是齿轮和螺丝钉，和别的更重要的部分比较起来，自然有轻重缓急第一第二之分，但它是对于整个机器不可缺少的齿轮和螺丝钉，对于整个革命事业不可缺少的一部分。”在我们社会主义建设的大机器上，有许许多多的“螺丝钉”，他们是“小”的，但又是不可缺少的。我们一定要掌握这个两点论，我们应当乐于做一个“螺丝钉”，并且要下定决心做一个奋发有为的“螺丝钉”！
