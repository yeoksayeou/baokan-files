    “With Three Heads Facing Each Other, Things Are Easy to Handle”
    Jiao Hewen

    Jiang Bingying, the female Party branch secretary of the Xiaoyuzhuang Production Team in Lianzhen Commune, Jiahe County, Hebei Province, is a well-known pacesetter in implementing policies. Her production team is among the best in the entire commune in terms of production and living standards. She says, "The policy is one head, the cadres are one head, and the commune members are another head. With these three heads facing each other, things are easy to handle." This statement hits the nail on the head.

    Policies, cadres, and commune members must also be integrated into one, the three heads combined into one, all working towards the same goal. If each acts independently, good things will not be accomplished. The Party's policies are excellent in every way, but if cadres and the masses do not study, disseminate, and implement them, it is all in vain. If cadres are sharp-eyed and capable, but lack policy guidance and the help of commune members, how many nails can you hammer even if you're made of iron? If commune members have righteous hearts, strong will, and rush forward in the face of difficulties, but lack policy support and cadre leadership, they will lose their direction and get lost, and their energy will not be used effectively. Furthermore, it's better for two heads to meet than for one head to work alone, but that's still not enough. For example, if policies meet with cadres, and the cadres understand and remember them thoroughly, but they don't convey the policies to the masses, they can't win the world by relying solely on their own efforts. Or, for example, if cadres deliver the policies to the masses, letting the policies return to their home, and the cadres then wash their hands of the matter, relax, and sleep soundly, has the policy actually been implemented? What are the masses thinking about the policy? Cadres can't be indifferent either, because the masses not only listen to what you say, but also watch what you do, and follow in your footsteps. If you don't move forward or move in the wrong direction, the masses will have to "checkmate" you. Or, for example, if cadres and commune members are also twisted together and become one, but there is no policy as the backbone, the cadres have no foundation, and the masses have no confidence, and they can't exert their strength fully even if they have it. In short, it all boils down to this: "With three heads facing each other, things are easy to handle." This is the truth, and it is also experience.

    Policies and cadres are closely linked, policies and the masses are as close as flesh and blood, and cadres and the masses are as inseparable as fish and water. "Three heads facing each other" is not accidental; it is inevitable. Precisely because of this, cadres deliver policies to the door, the masses welcome policies to their homes, and everyone keeps the policies in their hearts, and then works together according to the policies, moving in the same direction and stepping on the same point, allowing the policies to unleash their full power.

    With three heads facing each other, things are easy to handle, with each layer of meaning containing a layer of reason. When there are many people, things are easier to do. If thousands of cadres and tens of thousands of commune members share the same mind, how many Zhuge Liangs will emerge, and with policies as their eyes, production and life can be improved a hundredfold. In addition, comparing performances when facing each other makes it easy to distinguish genuine skills from fake ones. When cadres and the masses all master the Party's policies, it is like having a mirror to see your face, and a ruler to tailor clothes. No one can draw a square by comparing it to a circle. In order to ensure that the policies are accurate and do not deviate from the mark or go astray, the masses and cadres learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, consulting and discussing everything, making everything easy to handle. That is to say, with three heads facing each other, policies are easy to implement.

    The key to three heads facing each other lies in people. The Party's policies have a clear origin and destination, and they are oriented towards the masses. Cadres serve as bridges, bearing a heavy responsibility, ensuring that there are no discounts or half-measures in the journey of "delivering blessings to the door," and genuinely delivering the policies to the masses quickly, efficiently, and completely. This requires thoroughly investigating the situation and implementing the policies to the end, because when you give the bottom line (policies) to the masses, the masses will give their bottom line (wisdom) to you. This mass line of "bottom plus bottom" will become wider and wider.

    “三头对面事好办”
    焦合文
    河北省交河县连镇公社小于庄生产队女支部书记姜炳英，是出了名的贯彻执行政策的红旗手。她所在的生产队，说生产，论生活，全社数一数二。她说：“政策是一头，干部是一头，社员又是一头，三头对面事好办。”这话算说到家啦。
    政策、干部、社员也得三合一，三个头合成一个头，往一股绳上拧劲。一头一面，好事也不会办好。党的政策千个好、万个好，要是干部、群众不学、不传、不办，也是枉然。干部眼力高、本事大，要是没有政策引路，社员帮忙，算你浑身是铁，能打多少钉？社员心气正、脾气硬、见困难就冲，要是没有政策当家、干部撑腰，就会转了向、迷了路，劲使不到刀刃上。话进一步，两头见了面，总比一头一面好，可是，这还不够。比方说，政策跟干部见了面，干部说得透、记得下，可就是没把政策交给群众，光靠单枪匹马，打不了天下。又比方，干部把政策交给了群众，让政策回了老家，干部就万事大吉地退出门来，放了心，松了手，高枕头睡起懒觉来，到底政策落地没落地？群众对政策还有啥心思？干部不闻不问也不行，因为群众不光听你说，还要看你作，按着你的脚印走，你不走、走错了，群众都得“将”你的“军”。再比方，干部跟社员也扭在一起了，也打成一片了，可就是没有政策当主心骨，干部没根，群众没底，空有力气也甩不开膀子。说一千、道一万，还是那句话：“三头对面事好办”。这是实话，也是经验。
    政策跟干部一脉相通，政策跟群众骨肉相连，干部跟群众鱼水相关。“三头对面”不是偶然，这是必然。正因为这样，干部送政策上门，群众接政策坐炕头，大伙把政策记在心里，然后一块按政策办事，走在一个板上，踩在一个点上，让政策大发威力。
    三头对面事好办，一层意思一层理。人多好办事，千百个干部跟万千个社员同了心，要出多少个诸葛亮，再有政策当眼睛，生产、生活都能搞个一百成。另外，对了面比着干，真假把式好分辨。干部群众都掌握了党的政策就无异是：照脸有了镜子，裁衣有了尺子，谁也不能比着圆的画方的。为了让政策丁是丁，卯是卯，不离板，不走样，群众跟干部取长补短，商商量量，万事好办，这就是说，三头对了面，政策好兑现。
    三头对面，决定在人。党的政策来有踪，去有影，面向群众。干部当桥梁，担子重，在“送福上门”的一路上不打折扣，不半途而废，真正把政策多快好省、原原本本地交给群众，这就要摸情况一摸到底，贯彻政策一贯彻到底，因为你把底（政策）给了群众，群众就会把底（智慧）给了你，这条“底加底”的群众路线，就会越走越广、越宽。
