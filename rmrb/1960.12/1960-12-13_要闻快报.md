    Hebei Sends Large Numbers of Health Workers to the Countryside
    More than 30,000 health workers in Hebei Province are rushing to the front lines of agricultural production. Their main tasks are to prevent and treat winter and spring epidemics, and at the same time, combine with production to widely carry out mass medical prevention and health care activities. Through these efforts, they will further improve the health of farmers and strive for a bumper grain harvest next year.

    A Thousand-Person Scientific and Technological Investigation Team
    In the upsurge of the mass movement to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, the agricultural science and technology investigation team, jointly organized by the Provincial, Prefectural, and County Science and Technology Commissions and Science Associations of Hunan, conducted more than two months of scientific and technological investigation activities in the rural areas of the province. The total number of technical cadres, teachers and students from universities and colleges, and worker-peasant innovators participating in the investigation reached more than 1,000, and the scope of the investigation covered 27 counties and cities and more than 100 communes in various prefectures (autonomous prefectures).

They helped these units to more rationally arrange and dispatch materials, equipment, and labor, further tap production potential, and played a certain role in promoting the production of these units.
