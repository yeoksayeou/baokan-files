    Starting from "A Heroic Father Breeds a Heroic Son"
    Tang Xiaoding
    After reading the report on "Zhao Jinke Encourages His Son to Farm" in the *People's Daily* (November 14th) and the article "Not Valuing Gold and Silver, but Valuing Cultivation" (November 28th), I would like to add a few words.
    Communist Party member Zhao Jinke changed his son's names from Guijin (Precious Gold) and Guiyin (Precious Silver) to Zhao Geng (Zhao Plough) and Zhao Yun (Zhao Cultivate), and advised his son to farm, saying to his son: "You must not forget labor!" "Young people should endure some hardship and get some training." Well done! This kind of education is completely correct.
    As the saying goes, "A heroic father breeds a heroic son," which is possible, but not necessarily so. Only by influencing and educating one's son with revolutionary thoughts, words, and deeds, like Comrade Zhao Jinke, is it possible to促使（cùshǐ: cause, impel） for the son to become a "hero." If one is indulgent and dotes on one's son, the son may also learn bad habits and be influenced badly.
    In our country, with the leadership of the Communist Party, the advanced social system, and schools that serve proletarian politics and combine education with productive labor, our young generation lives in the happiest environment and receives a good education that is thousands of times better than in the old society. However, in the education of the next generation, family education has always occupied a certain important position in the past, present, and future.
    If a child grows up to be more than ten years old without sweeping the floor himself, without washing his clothes, and without knowing how to use a needle and thread to sew on a button that has fallen off; this reflects that the parents have not cultivated the child's ability to live independently. If a child is corroded by selfish and self-serving ideas that harm others and benefit oneself, but the parents are indifferent; this cannot be said to be irresponsible to the new generation.
    Lenin said that people educated in the old society can be said to have been infected "from the time they were breastfed" with the psychology, habits, and viewpoints of exploiters and all egoists. In our new society, from the time they are breastfed, we must cultivate young people to become the true future and hope of those who can inherit the revolutionary cause and embody the revolutionary cause, so that they love labor, are diligent and thrifty, have collectivist ideas, have a clear sense of right and wrong and love and hate, understand the pain of the old society and the happiness of the new society, and have the noble ideals of communism.
    The ideological front has no blanks. Classes in our country have not been completely eliminated, the political and ideological influence of the bourgeoisie still exists, the remnants of bourgeois rights still exist, and the traditional prejudices and habits of the old society still exist. Young people are like seedlings, and in this case, despite the bright sunshine and fertile land, without good cultivation in all aspects, the seedlings will also grow crookedly. Family, school, and society are all cultivators of young people. In addition to society and school, the family must also carefully and unremittingly cultivate them. We need "a heroic father breeds a heroic son," and we hope that each generation will be stronger than the last, because we never forget the revolutionary past and look forward to the communist future.
    Fulfill your responsibilities to your children! Educate your children better and help them grow into tall, towering trees!

### 从“老子英雄”说起

    从“老子英雄”说起
    唐小丁
    看了《人民日报》上《赵晋科鼓励儿子务农》的报道（11月14日）和《不重金银重耕耘》一文（11月28日），我还想说几句。
    共产党员赵晋科把儿子的名字由贵金、贵银改为赵耕、赵耘，劝儿子务农，对儿子说：“可不能忘了劳动啊！”“年青人应该吃点苦，锻炼锻炼。”做得好！这种教育方法是完全正确的。
    俗话说“老子英雄儿好汉”，这是可能的，但也不尽然。如像赵晋科同志那样以革命的思想、言论和行为影响儿子，教育儿子，才有促使儿子成为“好汉”的可能。如果对儿子放任和溺爱，儿子也可能学坏样，受到坏的影响。
    我们的国家里，有共产党的领导，有先进的社会制度，有教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的学校，这一切，都使我们年青的一代生活在最幸福的环境里，获得比旧社会高超上千百倍的良好的教育。但在对下一代的教育中，家庭教育无论在过去、现在、将来总是占着一定的重要地位。
    孩子长到十多岁，如果不自己动手扫地，不洗衣服，钮扣掉了也不会使针用线；这就反映了做父母的没有培养孩子的独立生活能力。孩子如果受了自私自利、损人利己思想的侵蚀，做父母的却漫不经心；这不能不说是对新的一代不负责任。
    列宁说过，旧社会里教养出来的人，可以说“从吃奶的时候起”就染上了剥削者和一切利己主义者的心理、习惯和观点。在我们的新社会里，也必须从吃奶的时候起，就培养青少年成为真正能够继承革命事业、体现革命事业的未来和希望的后代，使他们热爱劳动，勤俭，有集体主义思想，是非和爱憎分明，懂得旧社会的痛苦和新社会的幸福，有共产主义的高尚理想。
    思想阵地是没有空白的。我们国内的阶级还没有完全消灭，资产阶级的政治影响和思想影响还存在，资产阶级法权的残余还存在，旧社会的传统偏见和习惯势力还存在。青少年好比幼苗，在这种情况下，尽管有灿烂的阳光，有厚沃的土地，如果没有很好的各个方面的栽培，也会使幼苗弯曲地生长。家庭、学校和社会，都是青少年的栽培者，除了社会、学校外，家庭也要细心地不懈地培植他们。我们需要“老子英雄儿好汉”，希望一代强过一代，是因为我们决不忘记革命的过去，又展望共产主义的未来。
    尽到对孩子的责任！把孩子教养得更好，使他们成长为挺直的、参天的大树吧！
