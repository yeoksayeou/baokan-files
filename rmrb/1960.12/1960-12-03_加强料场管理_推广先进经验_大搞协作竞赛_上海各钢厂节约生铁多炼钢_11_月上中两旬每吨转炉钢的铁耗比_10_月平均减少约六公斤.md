According to a report from the Liberation Daily: Shanghai's iron and steel front workers are doing everything possible to save pig iron and strive to produce more and better steel with less iron. According to statistics from relevant departments, the iron consumption per ton of converter steel in the Municipal Metallurgical Bureau system decreased by an average of 25 kilograms in October compared to September, and decreased by approximately six kilograms in the first two ten-day periods of November compared to the October average.

During discussions of production increase and thrift plans, many factories spoke extensively to the broad masses of workers about the situation and carefully calculated accounts. They used various methods to educate the masses, enabling them to further recognize that reducing pig iron consumption is not only of great significance for increasing steel production and reducing costs but also directly related to saving manpower and material resources in other sectors of the national economy and supporting agriculture. As a result, the workers' enthusiasm for saving pig iron has greatly increased.

Once pig iron enters the factory, it first goes to the stockyard. To save pig iron, many steelmaking workshops first focused on stockyard management. Units such as the No. 2 Converter Workshop of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, the Open Hearth Workshop and No. 3 Converter Workshop of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, and the Steelmaking Plant of the Iron and Steel Research Institute weigh all pig iron brought into the stockyard and added to the cupola, and stack it separately according to its different components. The batching personnel keep abreast of the pig iron components at all times, ensuring uniform and accurate matching, so that the cupola is well-fed. Workers in the stockyard of the No. 1 Converter Workshop of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant carefully used magnets to pick up small pieces of iron left in the stockyard and send them into the cupola during stockyard clean-up.

Many steelmaking workshops have vigorously promoted advanced experiences in reducing iron consumption and achieved great results. The No. 1 Converter Workshop of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant adopted the furnace type of "shallow molten pool, large hearth, and small tuyere" with high air pressure. The average iron consumption in the first ten days of November decreased by about 29 kilograms compared to the previous month. The No. 2 Converter Workshop of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant humbly learned from the advanced experience of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant in changing single-row tuyeres to three-row tuyeres, reducing losses caused by splashing during converter blowing. The iron consumption in the middle ten days of November decreased by 121 kilograms compared to the first ten days.

In addition, some steelmaking departments have also actively launched a dragon-style collaboration and competition from the stockyard to steel casting, mobilizing workers in all links to vigorously save pig iron. Some units actively seek substitutes to reduce iron consumption. The Steelmaking Plant of the Iron and Steel Research Institute launched a "class-by-class, hundred-furnace, no-scrap-steel dragon-style collaboration and competition" from the stockyard to casting, with remarkable results. So far, the three converter shifts have had more than 500 heats without scrap steel, and the iron consumption in the middle ten days of November decreased by 96 kilograms compared to the first ten days. The workers of the Open Hearth Workshop of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, which won the national small open hearth high-yield and high-quality red flag, use iron oxide splashed from converter blowing instead of iron ore for steelmaking. In the past, only about three tons of iron oxide were added per heat of steel, but now it has increased to about five tons, greatly reducing the consumption of iron ore. The average iron consumption per ton of steel in November dropped to 1,018 kilograms, a decrease of 10 kilograms compared to the previous month.

    加强料场管理　推广先进经验　大搞协作竞赛
    上海各钢厂节约生铁多炼钢
    11月上中两旬每吨转炉钢的铁耗比10月平均减少约六公斤
    本报讯　据解放日报消息：上海钢铁战线职工千方百计节约生铁，力争用更少的铁炼出更多更好的钢。据有关部门统计，市冶金局系统每吨转炉钢的铁耗，10月份比9月份平均减少了二十五公斤，11月份上中两旬比10月份平均又减少了六公斤左右。
    在讨论增产节约计划的时候，很多厂向广大职工大讲形势，大算细账，用各种方法教育职工群众，使广大职工进一步认识到降低生铁消耗量，不仅对增加钢产量、降低成本有重大意义，而且对国民经济其它各部门人力、物力的节约，对农业的支援也有直接关系，因此职工节约生铁的积极性大大提高。
    生铁一进厂，首先到料场。为了节约生铁，许多炼钢车间就首先从料场管理抓起。上钢三厂第二转炉车间、上钢一厂平炉车间和第三转炉车间、钢铁研究所炼钢厂等单位，凡是运进料场和加入化铁炉内的生铁，都要过磅，并且根据生铁的不同成份分类堆放。配料员随时随地掌握生铁成份，保证搭配均匀、准确，使化铁炉吃饱吃好。上钢一厂第一转炉车间料场工人，在清理料场时用磁铁块细心地把遗留在料场上的小铁块吸起来，送进化铁炉内。
    许多炼钢车间大力推广降低铁耗的先进经验，取得了很大成绩。上钢三厂第一转炉车间采用高风压的“浅熔池、大炉膛、小风眼”的炉型，11月上旬平均铁耗比上月减少了二十九公斤左右。上钢一厂第二转炉车间虚心学习了上钢三厂将单排风眼改为三排风眼的先进经验，减少转炉吹炼过程中因喷溅而造成的损失，11月份中旬铁耗比上旬减少了一百二十一公斤。
    此外，有的炼钢部门还积极开展从料场到浇钢的一条龙协作大竞赛，发动各个环节的职工大力节约生铁。有的单位则积极寻找代用品，来降低铁耗。钢铁研究所炼钢厂从料场到浇注开展“班班百炉无废钢一条龙大协作竞赛”，效果非常显著。到现在转炉三个班都已经有五百多炉无废钢，11月中旬铁耗比上旬减少了九十六公斤。荣获全国小型平炉高产优质红旗的上钢一厂平炉车间工人，用转炉吹炼中喷出的氧化铁代替铁矿石炼钢，过去每炉钢只加三吨左右氧化铁，现在增加到五吨左右，大大降低了铁矿石的消耗量，11月份平均每吨钢的铁耗下降到一千零十八公斤，比上月平均下降十公斤。
