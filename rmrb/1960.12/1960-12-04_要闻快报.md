    Establishing High-Yield Plots with Production Teams as the Unit
    The Second Production Team of the Henan Production Brigade of the Dazhang Commune in Song County, Henan Province, established high-yield plots for various crops in 1959 based on the "Four Fixes" and "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system. They also correctly handled the relationship between high-yield plots and ordinary fields, promoting overall increases in the production of various crops.
    The facts of the past year have educated the masses, and the commune members are asking to gradually expand the high-yield plots. This year, the area of high-yield plots during the wheat and autumn harvests has been expanded to account for 17.23% of the total cultivated land, with an average yield per unit area 46.7% higher than that of ordinary fields. When planting wheat this year, the production team expanded the area of high-yield plots to 29.5%. The wheat in the high-yield plots is growing well and is currently being top-dressed and irrigated.
      Everyone Participates in Planting More Spring Crops
    The Seventh Production Team (contracted output unit) of the First Management Area (basic accounting unit) of the Liemian Commune in Wusheng County, Sichuan Province, while ensuring the completion of the spring planting plan, actively encourages commune members to plant more scattered plots during their spare time. It is clearly stipulated that whoever plants reaps the harvest, mobilizing the commune members' enthusiasm for increasing planting. The whole team has increased planting by an average of four or five fen of peas and broad beans and wheat per household, 200 rapeseed plants, and 1,700 vegetable seedlings.
    Adhering to the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" System: Large and Small Livestock Exceed Contracted Output
    The First Team of the Shengli Brigade of the Shengli Commune in Xilinhot, Inner Mongolia, with the direct help of Comrade Gao Wanbaozhabu, First Secretary of the Xilingol League Party Committee, has promoted production development over the past year by conscientiously implementing the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system. In the 1960 pastoral year, the team's total livestock increased by 31.5%, a net increase of 23.85%, with the actual output of large and small livestock exceeding the contracted output by 500 head (animals). Their winter preparations this year are better than in any previous year. The livestock are one to two grades fatter than in the same period last year; 2.3 million jin of grass have been harvested, 600,000 jin more than last year; and the construction of sheds and pens is basically complete. Commune members are actively preparing to welcome the winter lambs.
      Improving the Responsibility System Increases Labor Efficiency
    The Third Team of the Huangjing Production Brigade of the Hanjiang People's Commune in Mianyang County, Hubei Province, after signing the 1961 "Three Guarantees" contract with the production brigade, further established a production responsibility system for work groups. They divided the team's 65 full and semi-laborers into several work groups according to the current agricultural tasks and each person's physical strength, skills, and specialties. The team implemented a "Five Fixes" responsibility system for the work groups, including fixed short-term contracts, fixed tasks, fixed time, fixed quality, fixed work points, and fixed rewards and punishments, further enhancing the enthusiasm of the commune members. The cattle-feeding group cleaned up the cattle pen and the front and back yards in less than half a day, both feeding the cattle well and accumulating more manure.
      Carrying Out Appraisals and Competitions to Promote Production
    The Sanzhuang Production Team of the Dongyuan People's Commune in Huzhu Tu Autonomous County, Qinghai Province, on the basis of "Four Fixes" and "Three Guarantees and One Reward", regularly carries out appraisals and competitions, further enhancing the fighting role of each production team and increasing grain production year after year.
    Since the beginning of this year, this production team has organized nine large-scale appraisals and competitions during the stages of preparing for plowing, spring sowing, field management, autumn harvesting, and threshing. Advanced units and advanced experiences are immediately praised and promoted; problems are immediately studied and resolved, powerfully promoting the in-depth development of the "Learn from, Compare with, Catch up with, and Help" movement. Due to the appraisals and competitions carried out between production teams, between work groups, and among commune members, all the members of the team have maintained strong production enthusiasm. This year, after overcoming various natural disasters, grain production increased by 15% compared to last year.
    Adhering to the Mass Line Promotes Winter Planting
    The Sanwang Commune in Hechi County, Guangxi Province, has expanded its winter planting area by 31% due to its adherence to the mass line working method during winter planting.
    This year's winter planting plan for this commune was formulated by commune and brigade cadres who went deep into the production teams to discuss with the team cadres and commune members. During the consultation and discussion with the masses, the production teams first made plans for the planting area, varieties, yield targets, and time arrangements for various winter crops based on local conditions.
    Due to the working method of implementing the mass line at every level, the winter planting plan achieved "Four Satisfactions" among the commune, brigade, team, and commune members. The commune members' enthusiasm for winter planting is extremely high, both expanding the area and improving the quality of sowing.

    要闻快报
    以生产小队为单位建立丰产方
    河南嵩县大章公社河南生产大队第二生产小队，1959年就在“四固定”和“三包一奖”的基础上建立了各种作物的丰产方，并且正确处理了丰产方和一般田的关系，促进了各种作物全面增产。
    一年来的事实教育了群众，社员要求逐步扩大丰产方。今年麦秋两季搞的丰产方面积已扩大到占总耕地面积的17.23％，单位面积平均产量比一般田高46.7％。今年种麦时，生产队又将丰产方面积扩大到29.5％。现在丰产方内小麦长得很好，正在进行追肥浇水。
      人人动手增种小春作物
    四川武胜县烈面公社第一管理区（基本核算单位）第七生产队（包产单位），在保证完成小春播种计划的前提下，积极鼓励社员利用工余时间多种零星地。明确规定谁种谁收，调动了社员们大搞增种的积极性。全队平均每户已增种豌胡豆、小麦地四五分，油菜二百株，蔬菜一千七百窝。
    坚持“三包一奖”大小牲畜超包产
    内蒙古锡林浩特胜利公社胜利大队第一小队，在锡林郭勒盟盟委第一书记高万宝扎布同志的直接帮助下，一年来由于认真贯彻执行“三包一奖”制度，促进了生产发展。在1960年牧业年度里，小队牲畜总增31.5％，纯增23.85％，大小牲畜实产超过包产五百头（只）。他们今年的过冬准备工作比以往哪一年都好，畜膘比去年同期增加了一至二成；打草二百三十万斤，比去年多六十万斤；棚圈建设也已基本就绪。社员们积极准备迎接冬羔。
      健全责任制劳动工效高
    湖北省沔阳县汉江人民公社黄荆生产队第三小队，在与生产队签订了1961年的“三包”合同后，进一步建立了作业小组的生产责任制。他们将全队六十五个整、半劳动力，按当前农事活路和每人体力、技术、特长，划分成几个作业小组。小队对作业组实行小段包工和定任务、定时间、定质量、定工分、定奖惩的“五定”责任制，进一步发挥了社员的积极性。喂牛组在不到半天的工夫，就把牛栏和前后场子收拾得干干净净，既喂好牛，又多积肥。
      开展评比竞赛促进生产
    青海互助土族自治县东源人民公社三庄生产队在“四固定”和“三包一奖”的基础上，经常开展评比竞赛，进一步发挥了各生产小队的战斗作用，粮食连年增产。
    今年以来，这个生产队在备耕、春播、田间管理、秋收、打碾过程中，即先后组织了九次较大规模的评比竞赛。发现先进单位和先进经验，立即表扬、推广；发现问题，马上研究解决，有力地推动了“学、比、赶、帮”运动的深入开展。由于在小队与小队之间，作业组与作业组之间，以及社员之间开展了评比竞赛，全队社员始终保持着旺盛的生产热情，今年在战胜了各种自然灾害之后，粮食生产比去年增长了15％。
    坚持群众路线促进冬种工作
    广西河池县三旺公社在冬种当中，由于坚持群众路线的工作方法，冬种面积扩大了31％。
    这个公社今年的冬种计划，是由公社和大队干部深入到生产小队，和小队干部、社员群众共同讨论制订的。在和群众协商讨论过程中，首先由生产小队因地制宜地对各项冬种作物的种植面积、品种、产量指标以及时间安排等方面作出规划。
    由于层层贯彻群众路线的工作方法，冬种计划做到了公社、大队、小队、社员“四满意”，社员们的冬种积极性异常高涨，既扩大了面积，又提高了播种质量。
