Xinhua News Agency, San Salvador: Since the overthrow of the Lemus dictatorship, El Salvador has experienced an unprecedented surge of patriotic democracy, unseen since the establishment of the dictatorial government. Workers, youth, intellectuals, and office workers are all busy with organizational work. In the first week after the coup that ousted Lemus, the National Citizen Orientation Front, demanding democratic reforms, held more than fifty people's rallies across the country and established many committees of the National Citizen Orientation Front.

    The General Confederation of Labor of El Salvador has also been very active and is engaged in organizational work among the workers.

    Driven by the democratic forces, the government committee that took office after the coup has begun to fulfill some of its promises. The state of siege imposed by Lemus to suppress the people has been declared abolished, political exiles have begun to return home, and citizens arrested for political reasons have been released.

    The Communist Party of El Salvador pointed out that "the new situation in El Salvador marks a victory for the people." The Communist Party pointed out that after this coup, "the state machine has not fundamentally changed, nor have the economic forces within the ruling class changed."

    巩固反独裁斗争的胜利　推进国家的民主改革
    萨尔瓦多爱国民主力量积极活动
    据新华社讯　圣萨尔瓦多消息：在莱穆斯独裁政权被推翻以后，萨尔瓦多出现了一个从独裁政府建立以来从未有过的爱国民主高潮。工人、青年、知识分子和职员们都在忙着进行组织工作。在赶走莱穆斯的政变发生后的头一个多星期内，要求民主改革的全国公民方针阵线在各地举行了五十多次人民集会，并且建立了许多全国公民方针阵线的委员会。
    萨尔瓦多总工会也进行了许多活动，并且在工人中从事组织工作。
    在民主力量推动下，政变后执政的政府委员会已经开始实现了一些诺言。莱穆斯为镇压人民而实施的戒严状态被宣布废除了，政治流亡者已经开始回国，由于政治原因被捕的公民已经获得释放。
    萨尔瓦多共产党指出，“萨尔瓦多国内的新局势标志着人民的胜利。共产党指出，经过这一次政变，“国家机器并没有根本改变，统治阶级中的经济力量也没有改变”。
