Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 25th:  According to a report by the Vietnam News Agency, Polish Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Sirenkiewicz, wrote in a letter to Premier Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the 19th: "The People's Republic of Poland, a member of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Indochina, has consistently respected and thoroughly implemented the Geneva Accords, and it severely condemns the U.S. imperialists and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization bloc for interfering in Laos." Sirenkiewicz made these remarks in response to letters written by Premier Pham Van Dong on December 11th and 15th to countries responsible for implementing the Geneva Accords on Laos and some countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

Sirenkiewicz said in his letter, "The government of the People's Republic of Poland, like your government, is very concerned about the situation caused by the U.S. imperialism and certain member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization aggressive bloc grossly interfering in the internal affairs of Laos in opposition to the legitimate government of Prince Souvanna Phouma. This interference and support for the rebel groups blatantly violate the Geneva Accords and seriously threaten peace."

He said, "The government of the People's Republic of Poland supports the policy of peace, neutrality, and establishing good relations with all countries pursued by the legitimate government of Laos. This policy is in line with the fundamental interests of the Lao people and the Geneva Accords."

Sirenkiewicz said, "Faced with such a serious threat to peace in Laos, the government of the People's Republic of Poland will continuously strive to stop imperialist interference, ease tensions, and consolidate peace and security in that region."

    谴责美国及其仆从干涉老挝
    波兰支持老挝合法政府的和平中立政策
    新华社河内25日电　据越南通讯社报道，波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹在19日写给越南民主共和国范文同总理的一封信中说：“印度支那国际监察和监督委员会参加国波兰人民共和国一贯尊重并彻底执行日内瓦协议，它严厉谴责美帝国主义者和东南亚条约组织集团对老挝的干涉。”西伦凯维兹是在答复范文同总理12月11日和15日写给对执行关于老挝的日内瓦协议负有责任的国家和一些亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家的信件时说这番话的。
    西伦凯维兹在信中说，“波兰人民共和国政府同贵国政府一样，非常关切由于美帝国主义和东南亚条约组织侵略集团的某些成员国为了反对富马亲王的合法政府对老挝内政进行粗暴干涉而引起的局势。这种干涉和对叛乱集团的支持，悍然违反了日内瓦协议并严重威胁着和平。”
    他说，“波兰人民共和国政府支持老挝合法政府奉行的和平、中立和同一切国家建立良好关系的政策。这项政策符合老挝人民的基本利益和日内瓦协议。”
    西伦凯维兹说，“面对着老挝和平受到这样严重的威胁，波兰人民共和国政府将不断地努力制止帝国主义的干涉，缓和紧张局势和巩固那个地区的和平和安全。”
