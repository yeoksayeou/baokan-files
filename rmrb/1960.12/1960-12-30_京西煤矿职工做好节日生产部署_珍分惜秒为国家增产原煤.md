The staff and workers of the Beijing Western Mining Bureau in the capital, after completing the annual state plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target, are working hard and advancing victoriously. They have decided to adhere to production during the New Year holiday to produce more and better coal to meet the needs of national industrial production and people's lives.

In recent days, workers from the seven coal mines under the Jingxi Mining Bureau held meetings to summarize the experience of sustained leaps forward this year and discuss the excellent situation of the country, the bureau, and the entire mine in terms of production. The workers further realized that, due to the continued leap forward in China's industrial production, the demand for coal is increasing day by day. The miners deeply felt their glorious responsibility and decided to adhere to production during the holidays, seizing every minute and second to produce more coal for the country. The workers used the valuable time at the end of the year to set production targets and specific measures, launching a production increase competition.

In order to help workers achieve high yields, leading cadres at all levels of the Mining Bureau have gone to the front line underground to direct production. The Party Secretary and Director of the Mining Bureau led cadres from various departments to form seven working groups, going deep into the mines to eat, live, work, and consult with the workers.

The more enthusiastic the workers are, the more concerned the leadership is about the workers' lives. The mines have made proper arrangements for the workers' lives and cultural entertainment activities during the holidays, ensuring that everyone has adequate rest and entertainment time. The Party Secretary in charge of living affairs has personally gone to the kitchen to study the holiday food work with the canteen staff and formulate the holiday menu. The amateur cultural troupe is actively rehearsing programs in preparation for performances during the holidays. The film team is preparing to show feature films.

The more the leadership cares for the workers, the greater the workers' enthusiasm. The coal mining workers of the whole bureau are vigorously promoting advanced coal mining methods to increase the output of existing working faces and strive for high yields during the holidays. The tunneling workers are accelerating the speed of advancement, opening up three new working faces; the production support departments have fully prepared the equipment and materials for the new working faces, which can be put into production on New Year's Day.

    本报讯　首都京西矿务局全体职工，在提前超额完成全年国家计划之后，鼓足干劲，乘胜前进，决定在新年节日坚持生产，增产更多更好的煤炭，供应国家工业生产和人民生活的需要。
    连日来，京西矿务局所属七个煤矿的职工分别举行了大会，总结今年持续跃进的经验，讨论了全国、全局和全矿在生产上的大好形势。职工们进一步认识到：由于我国工业生产的继续跃进，对煤炭的需要量日益增长。各矿职工深深感到自己的光荣责任，决定节日坚持生产，抓紧一分一秒的时间为国家增产更多的煤炭。职工们利用岁末的宝贵时机，订好了包产指标和具体措施，展开了增产竞赛。
    为了帮助工人夺取高产，矿务局的各级领导干部已分别到井下第一线指挥生产。矿务局党委书记、局长带领各处室干部组成七个工作组深入各矿，和工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。
    职工们的干劲越高，领导方面对职工的生活更关心。各矿对节日期间职工的生活和文化娱乐活动，都作了妥善安排，保证每人都有充分的休息、娱乐时间。负责生活的党委书记已亲自下伙房，和食堂人员研究节日伙食工作，制定了节日的食谱。业余文工团现正积极排练节目，准备在节日中演出。电影队准备放映故事影片。
    领导上越关怀工人，工人的干劲越大。全局回采工人正在大力推广先进采煤方法，提高现有工作面产量，争取节日高产丰收。掘进工人加快进尺速度，开辟了三个新工作面；生产辅助部门已把新工作面的设备材料准备齐全，元旦就可投入生产。（附图片）
