Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd dispatch from Washington: The U.S. State Department is alarmed by the further strengthening of friendly relations between China and Cuba. State Department Press Officer Ripe made a statement to reporters on December 1, wantonly slandering the economic cooperation agreement and the 1961 trade protocol concluded between China and Cuba in Beijing. Ripe openly opposed the "increasing" friendly and mutually beneficial cooperation between the people of China and Cuba. He desperately attempted to counteract the impact of China's signing of the aforementioned agreement and protocol, even ridiculously claiming that these economic cooperation agreements were China's "determination to gain a greater foothold in the Western Hemisphere." Then, he revealed the U.S. government's own hostile attitude toward the Cuban revolution, shamelessly threatening Cuba, saying that the Cuban government's adoption of measures conducive to Cuba's independent economic development "will further limit the opportunities for the Cuban people to re-establish their ties with friends and neighbors in the Western Hemisphere."

U.S. government officials also did everything possible to denigrate the economic cooperation agreement and trade protocol concluded between China and Cuba. These officials openly interfered in the affairs of the Cuban government, intimidating them by saying that Cuba's adoption of such actions to develop foreign trade "would naturally reduce" Cuba's "freedom to buy and sell goods on the (capitalist) world market."

    中古友谊使美国感到恐慌
    美国务院公然对古巴进行威胁恫吓
    新华社2日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院对中国和古巴友好关系进一步加强感到恐慌。国务院新闻发布官里普1日对新闻记者发表谈话，大肆诬蔑中国和古巴两国在北京缔结的经济合作协定和1961年贸易议定书。里普露骨地反对中古两国人民的友好和互助合作联系“日益增加”。他竭力企图抵制中国同古巴签订上述协定和议定书的影响，居然把这些经济合作协议瞎说成是什么中国“决意在西半球取得一个更大的立足点”。接着，他便露出了美国政府自己敌视古巴革命的一副凶相，他无耻地威胁古巴说，古巴政府采取这种有利于古巴经济独立发展的措施“必将进一步限制古巴人民重新建立他们同西半球的朋友和邻邦之间的联系的机会”。
    美国的政府官员还竭尽能事来诋毁中古两国缔结的经济合作协定和贸易议定书。这些官员公然干涉古巴政府的事务，进行恫吓说，古巴采取这种发展对外贸易的行动“会自然减少”古巴“在（资本主义）世界市场上买卖商品的自由”。
