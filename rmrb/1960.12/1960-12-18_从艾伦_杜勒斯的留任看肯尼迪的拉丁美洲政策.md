    On Kennedy's Latin American Policy as Seen from Allen Dulles' Retention

    Editor's Note: When the next new president of the United States, Kennedy, was assembling his team, the American spy chief, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Allen Dulles, was the first to be announced as remaining in his original position. This is by no means accidental. On December 4th, the American *Worker's Weekly* published an article entitled "Dulles' Shadow Looms over Cuba and Threatens World Peace," exposing the close relationship between this spy chief and the American monopoly capital that is ravaging the people of Latin America. The following is a translated excerpt of the article:

    Allen Dulles seems to have received special approval from the president-elect, as Dulles was the first person Kennedy nominated when he began choosing his officials.

    Dulles, who directed the overthrow of the Guatemalan government in 1954, has become Kennedy's advisor on American military policy in the Caribbean.

    The fact is that Dulles represented nearly $50 million in Cuban sugar property and other interests in the Caribbean before entering the spy agency.

    In the 1930s and 1940s, Dulles represented Cuban sugar kings as a banker and lawyer. He was a director of the Henry Schroder Banking Corporation at 46 William Street, New York City. This bank owned many properties in Cuba before the Castro government intervened. The bank's record of activity in the Caribbean shows that it controlled Cuban sugar companies owning nearly 500,000 acres of land and producing hundreds of thousands of tons of sugar annually.

    "Moody's Industrial Manual," which lists the properties of major companies, illustrates the scale of the Manati and Francisco sugar industries in Camagüey and Oriente provinces of Cuba.

    The Manati Sugar Company itself is a small empire. It owns nearly 260,000 acres of Cuban land in total. The Manati Sugar Company also owns railroads and land. It owns 212 miles of railway. The Manati Sugar Company also controls the Port of Manati itself. Its total assets exceeded $20 million during the Batista regime.

    The Francisco Sugar Company is even larger. Its assets exceed $25 million. It owns less land, less than 200,000 acres, but its sugar production is greater. Its pastures are vast.

    These companies had indeed considerable power under the villainous Batista dictatorship. One can imagine how enthusiastically Dulles would encourage Kennedy's anti-Castro tendencies.

    Schroder Bank also had other interests in Cuba. Dulles was a key partner in his brother's (John Foster Dulles) law firm, Sullivan & Cromwell. Sullivan & Cromwell was the formal legal advisor to Schroder Bank and its Cuban companies.

    Dulles' law firm was once an agency that contacted the Batista dictatorship.

    It is appropriate to examine Dulles' interests in Central American countries.

    The interest lies in the United Fruit Company, which controls the small republics of Central America. One must never forget that the CIA and Dulles overthrew the Guatemalan government after President Arbenz began implementing land reform. The shooting started after the United Fruit Company's land was given to landless peasants.

    Dulles' law firm is the official representative of the International Railways of Central America, a railway company that is owned by the United Fruit Company and operates railroads in Central America. Schroder Bank is also there. Bill, the president of Schroder Bank, is also a director of the International Railways Company. (Attached picture)

### 从艾伦·杜勒斯的留任看肯尼迪的拉丁美洲政策

    从艾伦·杜勒斯的留任看肯尼迪的拉丁美洲政策
    编者按　在美国下届新总统肯尼迪拼凑班底时，美国特务头子、中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯首先被宣布留任原职。这绝不是偶然的。12月4日，美国《工人周报》发表了一篇题为《杜勒斯的影子笼罩着古巴和威胁着世界和平》的文章，揭发了这个特务头子和蹂躏着拉丁美洲人民的美国垄断资本之间的密切关系。现将文章摘译发表如下：
    艾伦·杜勒斯看来得到当选总统的特别赞许，因为杜勒斯是肯尼迪开始选择他的官员时提名的第一个人。
    在1954年指使推翻危地马拉人民政府的杜勒斯已经成为肯尼迪的关于美国在加勒比的军事政策的顾问。
    事实是，杜勒斯在进入间谍机构以前代表着将近五千万美元的古巴食糖财产和加勒比的其他利益。
    在三十年代和四十年代，杜勒斯作为银行家和律师代表着古巴食糖大王。他是纽约市威廉街四十六号的小亨利·施罗德银行的一个董事。这家银行在卡斯特罗政府进行干涉之前在古巴拥有很多财产。这家银行在加勒比的活动纪录表明，它控制了那些拥有将近五十万英亩的土地和年产几十万吨食糖的古巴食糖公司。
    列举各大公司的财产的“穆迪工业一览”的报告说明了古巴卡马圭省和奥连特省中的马纳蒂和弗朗西斯科糖业的规模。
    马纳蒂糖业公司本身是一个小小的帝国。它一共拥有将近二十六万英亩的古巴土地。马纳蒂糖业公司还拥有铁路和土地。它拥有二百一十二英里的铁路。马纳蒂糖业公司还控制了马纳蒂港口本身。它的全部财产在巴蒂斯塔政权执政期间超过了二千万美元。
    弗朗西斯科糖业公司的规模更大。它的财产超过了二千五百万美元。它拥有的土地少一些，不到二十万英亩，但是它的糖产量更大。它的牧场很大。
    这些公司在罪恶的巴蒂斯塔独裁政权下的势力的确是相当大的。人们可以设想，杜勒斯将多么热心地鼓励肯尼迪的反卡斯特罗的倾向。
    施罗德银行在古巴还有其他利益。杜勒斯是他的哥哥（约翰·福斯特·杜勒斯）的沙利文克伦威尔法律事务所的一个重要伙伴。沙利文克伦威尔法律事务所是施罗德银行和它的古巴公司的正式法律顾问。
    杜勒斯的法律事务所曾经是同巴蒂斯塔独裁政权接触的一个机构。
    研究一下杜勒斯在中美各国的利害关系是相宜的。
    利害关系在于控制着中美的各个小共和国的联合果品公司。人们决不可忘记，中央情报局和杜勒斯是在阿本斯总统开始实行土地改革以后推翻了危地马拉人民政府的。在联合果品公司的土地交给无地的农民以后，射击就开始了。
    杜勒斯的法律事务所是在中美各国设有铁路的联合果品公司的国际铁路公司的正式代表。施罗德银行也在那里。施罗德银行行长比耳也是国际铁路公司的一个董事。（附图片）
