Flowers of Friendship Blossom
Zhang Tiesheng, Head of the Sichuan Provincial Song and Dance Troupe, China

The Sichuan Provincial Song and Dance Troupe of China went abroad on August 7th. It successively accepted invitations from the Damascus International Fair in the United Arab Republic (UAR) Syrian region, the Lebanese Minister of Education, and the UAR Egyptian region's Ministry of Culture and National Guidance, to conduct visits and performances in Damascus, Beirut, and Cairo. It also performed several times for the UAR army in Cairo, Ismailia, and Alexandria. After concluding its performances in the UAR, the song and dance troupe, according to the cultural cooperation agreement between China and Albania, was invited to visit and perform in Tirana, the capital of Albania, as well as Durres, Shkodër, Korçë, Stalin City, and Vlorë. It returned to Beijing on October 16th.

During the two months and ten days of the journey, the song and dance troupe brought the friendship of the Chinese people to the people of the UAR and Lebanon, and to the people of the fraternal country of Albania. At the same time, we also returned to our motherland, laden with the friendship of the people of the UAR and Syria, and the deep affection of the Albanian people for the Chinese people.

We performed a total of eighteen shows in the UAR and Lebanon, and each show was warmly welcomed by the audience. The theater doors were often surrounded by crowds like tides, and applause, cheers, and calls for "Encore!" were constantly heard inside. The "Egyptian Progressive News" said that the new life of China and the national style expressed by the song and dance troupe in its programs "attract both dance fans and music fans," so the grand occasion of the performance can be described as unprecedented.

People gave all kinds of praise and compliments to the song and dance troupe's performance. We deeply know that this is not only out of appreciation for our country's song and dance performance art, but more importantly, out of respect and friendship for our great motherland and people. A driver in Damascus said to us, "I have watched it three times, but I will go to see the last one tonight." An academic leader in Beirut specifically asked someone to congratulate us on the success of our performance. In Cairo, a female artist said, "Every program you perform is so fascinating, not only is the dance magical, but also the Chinese music is really touching." One audience member pointed out when talking about the cooperation of the band, "Only the most organized nation can cooperate so well in the performance." Another audience member repeatedly expressed his friendly feelings towards the Chinese people after the performance, and said, "Your performance not only has a beautiful form, but also makes people feel its rich and abundant content." Even some officials in the Egyptian region of the UAR believed that "the reason why Chinese art has achieved such great achievements in just ten years is inseparable from the leadership and support of the government."

While abroad, we not only introduced Chinese dance, music, and singing to the general audience, but also learned from the excellent national arts of various countries. The "Picture" weekly wrote, "The performance of the Sichuan Provincial Song and Dance Troupe of China in the two regions of the UAR is a major event in the literary and art circles of the UAR. We can learn a lot of things, and we should learn how to use song and dance to express a pleasant, optimistic, and positive emotion." This is sincere and earnest. The Ministry of Culture and National Guidance of the Egyptian region of the UAR sent people to record our programs and photograph the musical instruments. The artists of the UAR also specially learned national musical instruments from us. We, in turn, made use of the visits arranged for us by the ministry to learn as much as possible about the folk art of the UAR.

In the process of our visit and performance in the UAR and Lebanon, many friendly activities were interspersed. In Damascus, Beirut, Cairo, Ismailia, and Alexandria, we visited the responsible persons of the relevant parties and received their friendly reception. The reception by Shawaf, the Minister of Economy of the Syrian region of the UAR, the reception by Sawe, the Deputy Minister of Culture and National Guidance of the Egyptian region, and the reception by the UAR military all left a deep impression on us.

We also visited Mari, the Secretary-General of the Arab-China Friendship Association in Cairo, and I presented the Arab-China Friendship Association with a gift in the name of the People's Republic of China-United Arab Republic Friendship Association. The welcome tea party held for us by the Arab-China Friendship Association was also full of enthusiastic atmosphere.

In the UAR and Lebanon, whether in hotels or theaters, on the streets or in the alleys, we often encountered local people nodding, smiling, or greeting us in a friendly manner. This fully reflects their friendship towards the Chinese people. A sculptor in Damascus said when he gave me a beautifully crafted small wooden box, "A small gift conveys a great friendship, this is the friendship I express to the Chinese people." An audience member in Cairo put it even better: "Thank you very much for your performance. Although our two countries are far apart, we will always be friends."

As soon as we left the UAR, we went to fraternal Albania. The comrades of the song and dance troupe regarded the performance in Albania as their glorious task. Because we have always sincerely admired and loved the heroic Albanian people. The heroic Albanian people, in the face of fierce enemies, were not afraid of violence and difficulties, and demonstrated the heroic spirit of the revolutionary proletariat in the struggle against the US imperialist policy of aggression and war and against modern revisionism.

We arrived in many places in Albania such as Tirana, Durres, Shkodër, Korçë, Stalin City, and Vlorë, and performed a total of eleven shows, each of which was warmly welcomed by the audience. When we held our first performance in Tirana, Comrade Kasapi, the head of the Albanian National Song and Dance Troupe and the director of the Acrobatics Theater, gave a speech before the performance to express his welcome. He said that the song and dance troupe's programs were full of optimism, fully demonstrating the Chinese people's yearning for a new life and their love for the Chinese Communist Party and for the leader Mao Zedong. When we held a farewell performance in Tirana, Comrade Chachi Leshi, the Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania, and other party and government leaders watched the performance. That night, the Albanian Ministry of Education and Culture and the Albanian-China Friendship Association hosted a banquet for us, and Comrade Mitro Jorqi, the Deputy Minister of Education and Culture of Albania, also gave a speech at the banquet. What moved us in particular was the warm and cordial hospitality of the responsible comrades of the party and government in various places, artists, and the masses, which made us feel like we were back home wherever we went. The deep friendship of the Albanian people towards the Chinese people has given us an indelible impression.

After we arrived in Tirana from Cairo, our song and dance actors learned Albanian singing and dancing from the song and dance actors in Tirana. Under their careful teaching and the guidance of Comrade Shetaj, the art director of the Albanian National Song and Dance Troupe, our song and dance actors learned two folk songs and a dance, and performed them. In addition, we were educated in many visits. The firm stance of the Albanian people in opposing imperialism and modern revisionism, as well as the brilliant achievements they have made in socialist construction, have deeply educated every member of the song and dance troupe.

Now, we have returned to our motherland, but we still miss our Albanian brothers. We wish the fraternal friendship between the people of China and Albania will be more consolidated and developed, and we wish the Albanian people will move from victory to greater victory under the leadership of the Albanian Party of Labor headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha.

    友谊之花朵朵开
    中国四川省歌舞团团长　张铁生
    中国四川省歌舞团在8月7日出国，先后应阿联叙利亚地区大马士革国际博览会、黎巴嫩教育部长以及阿联埃及地区文化与国家指导部的邀请，在大马士革、贝鲁特、开罗进行了访问演出，并在开罗、伊士美利亚、亚历山大为阿联军队演出过几次。结束了在阿联的演出以后，歌舞团又根据中国和阿尔巴尼亚两国的文化合作协定，应邀到阿尔巴尼亚首都地拉那以及都拉斯、斯库台、科尔察、斯大林城、发罗那进行了访问演出，在10月16日返回北京。
    在两个月零十天的旅程中，歌舞团把中国人民的友谊带给了阿联和黎巴嫩两国的人民，带给了兄弟之邦的阿尔巴尼亚的人民。同时，我们也满载阿联和叙利亚人民的友谊，和阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国人民的深情厚谊，返回祖国。
    我们在阿联和黎巴嫩一共演出了十八场，每场都受到观众的热烈欢迎。剧院门前经常围着像潮水一般的人群，场内不断听到鼓掌、喝采以及“再来一个”的呼声。“埃及进步报”说，歌舞团在节目中所表现的新中国的生活面貌和民族风格“既吸引着舞蹈迷，也吸引着音乐迷”，因此演出的盛况可算是空前的。
    人们对歌舞团的演出给予种种好评和称赞。我们深知，这不仅是出于对我国歌舞表演艺术的欣赏，更重要的是对我们伟大祖国和人民的尊敬和友好。大马士革的一位司机对我们说，“我已经看过三次了，但今晚还要去看最后的一场”。贝鲁特的一位学术界领袖特地叫人来祝贺我们的演出成功。在开罗，一位女艺术家说，“你们演出的每个节目都是这样的令人神往，不仅舞蹈有魔力，中国音乐也真感人。”有一位观众在谈到乐队的合作时指出，“只有组织性最强的民族才能在演出时相互配合得这样好。”还有一位观众在演出结束后一再向我们表示他对中国人民友好的感情，并且说，“你们的表演不仅具有美的形式，而且令人感到它充实丰富的内容”。甚至阿联埃及地区的官方也有人认为“中国艺术之所以能在短短十年中得到这样高的成就，是同政府的领导和支持分不开的。”
    我们在国外不但向广大的观众介绍中国的舞蹈、音乐和歌唱，也向各国文艺界学习他们优秀的民族艺术。“图画”周刊写道，“中国四川省歌舞团在阿联两个地区的演出，是阿联文艺界的一件大事，我们可以学习很多的东西，我们应该学习如何用歌舞来表达一种愉快、乐观和积极的感情。”这是语重心长的。阿联埃及地区文化和国家指导部曾派人把我们的节目录了音，把乐器照了像，阿联的艺术家还特别向我们学习民族乐器等。我们则利用该部为我们安排的参观访问尽可能多地了解、学习阿联的民间艺术。
    在我们到阿联和黎巴嫩访问演出的过程中，穿插进行了许多友好活动。在大马士革、贝鲁特、开罗、伊士美利亚和亚历山大等地，我们访问了各有关方面的负责人，获得了他们友好的接待。阿联叙利亚地区经济部长沙瓦夫的招待会，埃及地区文化和国家指导部次长萨韦的招待会以及阿联军方的招待会，给我们留下了深刻的印象。
    我们在开罗还访问过阿拉伯—中国友好协会秘书长马里，我曾以中华人民共和国—阿拉伯联合共和国友好协会的名义赠送阿中友协一笔礼品。阿中友协为我们举行的欢迎茶会，也充满了热烈的气氛。
    在阿联和黎巴嫩各地，不管在旅馆或是剧场内外，在街头、巷尾，我们都不时碰到当地人民向我们友好地点头、微笑或招呼。这充分反映出他们对中国人民的友谊。大马士革一位雕刻家送我一个精制的小木盒时说，“礼轻友谊重，这就是我对中国人民所表示的友谊。”开罗的一位观众说得更好：“非常感谢你们的演出。我们两国虽然相距很远，但我们永远是朋友。”
    一离开阿联，我们就前往了兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚。歌舞团的同志们都把在阿尔巴尼亚的演出当作自己的光荣任务。因为我们对于英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民一向是衷心敬佩和爱戴的。英勇的阿尔巴尼亚人民在面对着凶恶的敌人不畏强暴、不畏困难，在反对美帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策、反对现代修正主义的斗争中表现出革命无产阶级的英雄气概。
    我们在阿尔巴尼亚到了地拉那、都拉斯、斯库台、科尔察、斯大林城、发罗那等许多地方，一共演出了十一场，场场都受到观众的热烈欢迎。我们在地拉那举行首次演出时，阿尔巴尼亚民族歌舞团团长、杂技剧院院长卡萨皮同志曾在演出前讲了话表示欢迎。他说，歌舞团的节目充满了乐观主义的精神，充分表现了中国人民对新生活的向往和对中国共产党、对领袖毛泽东的热爱。当我们在地拉那举行告别演出时，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国人民议会主席团主席恰奇·列希同志等党政领导人观看了演出。当晚阿尔巴尼亚教育和文化部、阿中友协设宴招待我们，阿尔巴尼亚教育和文化部副部长米特罗约尔基同志还在宴会上讲了话。使我们特别感动的是，各地党政负责同志、艺术家和群众热情和亲切的款待，使我们不论走到哪里都像回到了自己家里一样。阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国人民的深情厚谊，实在给了我们以不可磨灭的印象。
    当我们从开罗到了地拉那以后，我们的歌舞演员曾向地拉那的歌舞演员学习阿尔巴尼亚的歌唱和舞蹈。经过他们的精心教授以及阿尔巴尼亚民族歌舞团艺术指导谢台约同志的指导，我们的歌舞演员学会了两首民歌和一种舞蹈，并且进行演出。此外，我们还在许多参观访问中受到教育。阿尔巴尼亚人民在反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义等方面进行的坚定立场以及在社会主义建设上获得的光辉成就，都深深地教育了歌舞团的每一个成员。
    现在，我们已经回到了祖国，可是我们仍然怀念着阿尔巴尼亚兄弟，我们预祝阿中两国人民的兄弟友
  谊更加巩固和发展，并且预祝阿尔巴尼亚人民在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，从胜利走向更大的胜利。（附图片）
