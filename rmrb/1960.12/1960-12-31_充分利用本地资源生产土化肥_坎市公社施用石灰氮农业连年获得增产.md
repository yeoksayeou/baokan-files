    Fully Utilize Local Resources to Produce Native Fertilizer
    Kan City Commune Achieves Consecutive Years of Increased Production by Applying Calcium Cyanamide
    (Our report) The Kan City Commune in Yongding County, Fujian Province, has greatly increased its production and promotion of calcium cyanamide. The commune has applied an average of 60 to 70 jin per mu for the past two years, which has strongly promoted agricultural production. Recently, the Yongding County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party summarized the commune's calcium cyanamide production and decided to further promote their successful experiences throughout the county.
    Most of the land in Kan City Commune is acidic soil, suitable for nitrogen fertilizer. At the same time, the local limestone resources are abundant. Therefore, in the winter of 1958, the commune decided to vigorously develop calcium cyanamide production and selected Wenxi Brigade as a demonstration pilot. Calcium cyanamide was a new thing. When it was first manufactured and promoted, some people were skeptical. The commune Party committee, on the one hand, conducted propaganda among cadres and the masses, and on the other hand, adopted a combination of cadres, veteran farmers, and technicians to establish experimental fields at the commune, brigade, and production team levels. Last spring, the commune Party secretary and Wenxi Brigade cadres conducted experiments at the entrance of Huanglaozhai. The results proved that the yield of those who applied calcium cyanamide increased by 28% compared with those who did not. In order to educate the masses, the commune Party committee organized more than 200 people, including cadres, production team leaders, and young activists, to visit the site during the summer harvest. The masses saw with their own eyes that the early rice was growing well and took the initiative to ask the commune to vigorously develop calcium cyanamide production. All the brigades in the commune began to popularize its use in the summer of last year.
    After the promotion and use of this fertilizer, good results were achieved. This year, the 5.4 mu of early rice fields in Wenxi Brigade were fertilized with 1,370 jin of calcium cyanamide, with an average yield of 480 jin per mu, an increase of 77% compared with the early season of 1959 when calcium cyanamide was not used. Two-fen-three-li of flue-cured tobacco in Wuxian Production Team was fertilized with 120 jin of calcium cyanamide (applied in three times), with an average yield of 550 jin per mu, more than twice the normal yield. Sweet potatoes, pumpkins, and other crops have all achieved different degrees of increased production after application.
    After many experiments, it was proved that the application of calcium cyanamide had good results. Therefore, the commune members generally loved to use calcium cyanamide, and there was a situation where teams competed for calcium cyanamide. This year, during the commune's call to vigorously grasp autumn grain field management, the commune members went to the factory at night to wait for calcium cyanamide in order to use more calcium cyanamide.
    Through large-scale promotion and use, the commune has basically mastered the nature and use of this fertilizer. From the experimental process, it was unanimously believed that the biggest benefit of applying calcium cyanamide is that it can increase soil temperature and accelerate the decay of weeds, especially when applied to winter paddy fields and cold water paddy fields. Applying it together with organic fertilizer can also promote the formation of a structure in the soil that is conducive to crop growth.
    Kan City Commune's development of calcium cyanamide production adhered to the principle of focusing on native methods and starting from low to high levels, implementing diligence and frugality in running factories, such as using blue bricks instead of refractory bricks, and using old houses when there were no factory buildings. This set off a great upsurge in calcium cyanamide production throughout the commune, and more than 100 small calcium cyanamide factories were established throughout the commune.
    Since the beginning of this spring, in the movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, many factories have revolutionized their tools, changed heavy manual operations to mechanized and semi-mechanized operations, greatly improved labor productivity, and promoted the growth of calcium cyanamide production. After technical innovation, the Wenxi Brigade calcium cyanamide factory realized powered feeding and motorized transportation, which improved work efficiency by more than two times. The production level increased from 3,300 jin per day per 36 people to 10,000 jin per day per 15 people, and the cost of manufacturing calcium cyanamide was also reduced.
    The commune's calcium cyanamide production adopted a combination of perennial and seasonal production methods. In addition to the 25 factories with 76 people engaged in perennial production, the others were engaged in agriculture during busy farming seasons and in production during slack seasons, which enabled production to grow rapidly.
    According to statistics, since the establishment of the factory in the winter of 1958, the commune has produced more than 10 million jin of calcium cyanamide, which has increased the need for fertilizer for various crops at various times, and more than 7 million jin of calcium cyanamide have been used in the past two years. This year, the application area has increased from 45% last year to 92%, with an average application of about 70 jin per mu. Remote mountainous areas that used to apply little or no fertilizer have also applied calcium cyanamide, thus achieving large-scale increased production. In 1959, the commune's grain output increased by 8% compared with the Great Leap Forward in 1958; this year, the summer crops increased by another 9%.

### 充分利用本地资源生产土化肥  坎市公社施用石灰氮农业连年获得增产

    充分利用本地资源生产土化肥
    坎市公社施用石灰氮农业连年获得增产
    本报讯　福建永定县坎市公社大量制造和推广使用石灰氮，两年来平均每亩施用了六、七十斤，有力地促进了农业增产。最近中共永定县委对这个社石灰氮生产进行了总结，决定在全县进一步推广它们的成功经验。
    坎市公社绝大部分土地是属于酸性土壤，宜于施氮肥；同时当地石灰石资源丰富，因此这个社在1958年冬季决定大搞石灰氮生产，并选定文溪大队作为示范试点。石灰氮是新生事物，开始制造推广的时候，有的人抱着怀疑态度。公社党委一方面向干部、群众进行宣传，一方面采取干部、老农、技术员结合，从公社、大队、生产队层层建立试验田。去年春天公社党委书记和文溪大队干部在黄老寨门口进行试验，结果证明，施用石灰氮的比没有施用的增产了28％。公社党委为了教育群众，在夏收时组织了干部、生产队长、青年积极分子等两百多人实地参观，群众亲眼看到早稻生长得好，就主动要求公社大搞石灰氮生产。全社各大队从去年夏季开始便普遍推广使用。
    推广使用这种肥料以后，收到了很好的效果。今年文溪大队的五亩四分早稻田，施上一千三百七十斤石灰氮，平均每亩产四百八十斤，比1959年早季未施用石灰氮增产77％。武先生产队的两分三厘烤烟施石灰氮一百二十斤（分三次施），平均每亩产五百五十斤，超过一般产量两倍。番薯、南瓜等各种作物施用后，都取得不同程度增产。
    经过多方面试验，证明施用石灰氮效果良好，因此，该社社员们普遍爱用石灰氮，出现了队队争着要石灰氮的局面。今年公社号召大抓秋粮田间管理期间，社员为了多用石灰氮，晚上还到工厂等着领取石灰氮用。
    通过大面积推广使用，这个社已经基本掌握了这种化肥的性质和使用规律。从实验过程中，一致认为施用石灰氮最大的好处是可以增加土温，加快杂草的腐烂，特别是施在浸冬田、冷水田最为适宜。在施用它的同时增施有机肥，还能促进土壤发生有利于作物生长的结构。
    坎市公社发展石灰氮生产，坚持了以土为主，由低到高的方针，实行勤俭办厂，如用青砖代替耐火砖，没有厂房就利用旧房子。这样就在全社范围内掀起大造石灰氮的热潮，全社办了一百多个小型石灰氮厂。
    今年入春以来，在技术革新和技术革命运动中，大闹工具革新，许多厂都改变了繁重的手工操作为机械化、半机械化操作，大大提高了劳动生产率，促进石灰氮生产的增长。文溪大队石灰氮厂，通过技术革新后，实现了推料动力化，运输车子化等，提高工效两倍以上，生产水平由原来三十六人日产三千三百斤，提高到十五人日产一万斤，而且还降低了制造石灰氮的成本。
    这个社的石灰氮生产，采取常年性和季节性生产相结合的办法，全社除常年生产的二十五个厂七十六个人外，其他是农忙务农，农闲生产，使生产增长很快。
    据统计全社从1958年冬建厂以来，共生产石灰氮一千多万斤，增加了各个时期、各种作物的用肥需要，两年来就用了石灰氮七百多万斤。今年施用面积由去年的45％增加到92％，平均每亩施七十斤左右。过去少施或从来没有施过的边远山区，也都施上石灰氮肥，因此取得了大面积增产。全社1959年粮食产量比大跃进的1958年增产8％；今年夏熟作物又增产了9％。
