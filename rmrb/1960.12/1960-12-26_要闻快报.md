Continuing to Expand Winter Planting in the Deep Winter Season
Sichuan is making full use of the favorable natural conditions of high local temperatures and long frost-free periods to continue expanding the area of winter planting.

The expansion work in various places is closely integrated with the current field management of minor spring crops. While strengthening field management of existing crops, production teams of various people's communes have organized professionals to check river滩, check field ridges, and check between rows of crops, planting as they check, planting as many nests as possible, transplanting as many seedlings as possible, and expanding the planting of wheat, spring potatoes, peas, broad beans, and other food crops wherever possible.

In the winter planting, the selection of seeds, crop arrangements, and planting techniques all fully consider the principle of adapting to local conditions. Various places have selected crop varieties with strong spring characteristics, strong cold resistance, and the ability to mature early and produce high yields. In river滩 land closer to the water level, early-maturing barley, broad beans, and other crops are generally sown; in 漕田 and low-lying fields, crops with strong waterlogging resistance and short maturity periods are generally selected.

Taking Effective Measures to Resist and Prevent Winter Drought
In Qianxi County, Guizhou Province, as soon as winter drought began to appear, the production teams of Chengguan Commune, under the unified leadership of the commune party committee, took various measures according to local conditions to fight the winter drought. At present, more than 3,000 mu of drought-stricken summer crops throughout the commune have been irrigated in a timely manner, and growth has returned to normal. In order to maximize irrigation efficiency, all 54 production teams in the commune have organized follow-up watering groups to carry out follow-up irrigation according to the size of the seedlings and the degree of drought. Generally, rapeseed is watered first, followed by wheat, and then barley and other crops. In order to save water, everyone also adopted the method of using river water first, then ditch water, and using pond water first, then manure pit water. Crops were quickly irrigated.

Production and Construction Corps Establishes Tractor Repair and Distribution Network
The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps has established a multi-level tractor repair and distribution network, vigorously carrying out tractor and agricultural machinery repair and distribution and parts production, ensuring that the average attendance rate of tractors in various farms reaches more than 75%, greatly improving the efficiency of tractor farming.

Before 1958, only the first level of each reclamation area had established a tractor repair and distribution plant. At present, a relatively complete four-level tractor repair and distribution network has been formed from the corps to the farm, basically achieving that major tractor repairs do not leave the reclamation area and management office, and minor repairs do not leave the farm.

Pruning and Fertilizing to Strengthen Winter Orchard Management
Shaoruikou Production Team of Huangwu Commune in Yantai City, a nationally renowned apple-producing area, is strengthening winter orchard management by summarizing past experiences in order to strive for a greater harvest next year. In winter orchard management, the first step is to apply sufficient base fertilizer; the second is to cultivate the orchard land; the third is to clean the orchard and thoroughly eliminate diseases and insect pests; and the fourth is to prune according to local conditions and trees to maintain the nutrients of the fruit tree branches. In order to ensure the implementation of the above measures, party branch members go deep into the front line, dividing up areas and taking charge, following through to the end. At the same time, they also organized skilled commune members to participate in pruning teams and a certain amount of labor to carry out winter cultivation and land preparation.

Naiman Banner Massively Breeds Donkeys
According to the advantages of donkeys, such as their wide range of uses, easy feeding, and grass-saving nature, Naiman Banner in Inner Mongolia has massively developed donkeys, increasing the number of donkeys in the banner by more than 1,200 this year alone. Donkeys have played a significant role in agricultural production. According to preliminary statistics, donkeys in this banner complete about 35% to 40% of the total workload in animal power labor such as spring plowing, summer hoeing, the three autumn harvests, threshing, and delivering grain. At present, all production teams have prepared a large amount of forage and warm sheds for donkeys to safely overwinter.

Exchanging Experiences at the Hunting Competition
Fifty-one people, including armed forces ministers from various communes in Fanshi County, Shanxi Province, representatives from advanced management areas and advanced groups in fighting mountain pests, and advanced hunters, held a hunting competition in Yantou Commune. Through competition assessments, experience exchanges, and on-site competitions, one advanced commune, two advanced management areas, three advanced groups and competition-winning groups were selected, and thirteen advanced hunters were selected.

    要闻快报
    在深冬季节继续扩大冬种
    四川各地充分利用当地气温较高、无霜期长的有利自然条件，继续扩大冬种面积。
    各地的扩种工作是紧密结合当前小春作物田间管理进行的。各人民公社的生产队，在加强现有作物田间管理的同时，都组织专业人员，查河滩、查田坎、查作物幅里行间，随查随种，能种一窝种一窝，能栽一苗栽一苗，见缝插针地扩种小麦、春洋芋、豌豆、胡豆等粮食作物。
    冬种中选用种子、作物安排、播种技术等，都充分注意了因地制宜的原则。各地都选用春性强、抗寒力强，并能早熟高产的作物品种。在离水位较近的河滩地，一般都播种早熟早收的大麦、胡豆等作物；在漕田、下湿田上，一般都选种了抗涝力强和成熟期短的作物。
    采取有效办法抗预冬旱
    贵州黔西县城关公社各生产队，在冬旱刚一露头就在公社党委统一领导下，因地制宜地采取各种措施，和冬旱进行斗争。目前，全社已有三千多亩受旱的夏收作物，得到及时灌溉，生长转为正常。为了发挥灌溉效益，全社五十四个生产小队，都组织了追淋作业组，根据苗架大小、受旱程度，分清先后进行追灌。一般是先追油菜，后追小麦，再追大麦等其他作物。为了节约用水，大家还采取先用河水、后用沟水，先用塘水、后用粪坑水的办法。作物很快得到灌溉。
    生产建设兵团建立拖拉机修配网
    新疆生产建设兵团分级建立拖拉机修配网，大搞拖拉机、农机具修配和配件生产，保证了各农场拖拉机出勤率平均达到百分之七十五以上，大大提高了拖拉机耕作效能。
    在一九五八年以前，只有各垦区一级建立了拖拉机修配厂。目前，从兵团到农场，已形成了一个比较完整的四级拖拉机修配网，基本上作到了拖拉机大修不出垦区和管理处，小修不出农场。
    整枝施肥加强果园冬季管理
    闻名全国的苹果产地烟台市黄务公社绍瑞口生产队，为争取明年更大丰收，总结历年经验，加强果园冬季管理。在果园冬管中，首先施足基肥；第二整刨园地；第三清理果园，彻底消灭病虫害；第四因地因树修剪，以保持果树枝干的养分。为保证以上措施的实现，党支部委员深入第一线，分片包干、一抓到底。同时还组织了有技术的社员参加修剪队和一定的劳力进行冬刨、整地。
    奈曼旗大量繁殖毛驴
    内蒙古奈曼旗根据毛驴用途广、好饲养、省草料的优点，大量发展毛驴，今年一年内全旗毛驴增加了一千二百多头。毛驴在农业生产上发挥了重大的作用，据初步统计，这个旗在春耕、夏锄、三秋、打场、送粮等畜力劳动中，毛驴大约完成整个工作量的百分之三十五至百分之四十左右。目前各生产队都为毛驴安全过冬准备了大量的草料和暖棚暖圈。
    在打猎比武会上交流经验
    山西繁峙县各公社的武装部长、打山害的先进管理区、先进小组代表和先进猎手等五十一人在岩头公社举行打猎比武会。经过比武会的评比，交流经验，现场比武等形式，评选出先进公社一个，先进管理区二个，先进小组和比武优胜小组三个，并评出先进猎手十三名。
