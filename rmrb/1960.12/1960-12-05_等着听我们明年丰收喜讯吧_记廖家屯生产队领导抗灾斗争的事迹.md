　　“Wait to Hear Our Good News of a Bumper Harvest Next Year”
　　——Record of the Deeds of the Leaders of the Liaojiatun Production Team in Combating Disaster
　　　　Lin Yi Dazhong Bao Reporter

　　Liaojiatun is a production team in Chudun People’s Commune, Tancheng County, Shandong Province. This summer it suffered a severe flood. Now, there are few traces of the disaster left in the village.

　　Four Submersions and Four Plantings Conquer “Heaven”

　　Just as the spring corn was setting kernels, the summer sweet potatoes were taking root, and the soybeans were emerging from the ground, a heavy rain suddenly struck, turning 90% of the team's land into a vast expanse of water. After draining the water, all the soybeans were ruined. The commune members seized the opportunity to sow again. Who would have thought that just as the second planting of soybeans sprouted two leaves, another heavy rain came, rendering their efforts and seeds wasted again. "Farming is dealing with nature. How many years are blessed with favorable weather? Plant even if it's washed away!" The commune members were full of fighting spirit and changed to planting mung beans and other crops. Before the crops from the third sowing emerged, another heavy rain came. At this time, the emotions of some commune members became somewhat abnormal. Some said: "How can there be such a year? Heaven is deliberately denying us food." The Party branch discovered this situation and immediately organized everyone to analyze the favorable conditions for combating the disaster, strengthening everyone's confidence. How to make up for the losses caused by the disaster? Secretary Liao Junqi consulted with one elderly person after another. Based on the advice of the old "advisers," they decided to replant buckwheat and autumn vegetables.

　　With a plan in place and determination strengthened, Secretary Liao Junqi resolutely said to the commune members: "Seizing grain from nature is like fighting the enemy. As long as we have determination and methods, there is no unwinnable battle." The commune members' enthusiasm was boosted, and they unanimously expressed: the greater the disaster, the greater the effort. They planted for the fourth time in one go. Afterwards, although there was a fourth flood, it was quickly overcome by the cadres and commune members. After drainage, weeding, and topdressing, just as the secretary said, they finally conquered "Heaven." The part of the wheat stubble land originally thought to be barren, due to good management, still yielded more than 1,200 jin per mu; the third planting of soybeans still yielded 80-90 jin per mu. Four plantings and four submersions, with rainfall reaching 1,170 millimeters between summer and autumn, they were still able to harvest more than 528,000 jin of grain throughout the year! This is the victory of the Party's leadership, the victory of the people's commune, and the victory of the masses' struggle!

　　Make Up for Grain Reduction in Eight Ways

　　The flood was indeed too severe. Despite people's courageous fight to seize grain from Heaven, grain production was still reduced by one-third compared to last year. What methods should be used to make up for the losses? Cadres, Party members, and all commune members summarized the historical experience of disaster relief and production and decided to "make up for it in eight ways." That is, make up for the reduced production in low-lying areas with high-lying areas, make up for the reduced production of early autumn crops with late autumn crops, make up for the reduced grain production with vegetables, make up for the reduced agricultural production with sideline occupations, make up for the reduced straw with wild grass...

　　With heavy rain and abundant grass, the commune members adopted the method of "taking a sickle to the fields and bringing back a load when returning home," and stored more than 90,000 jin of dry green grass, nearly 20,000 jin of pig feed, plus other fodder, enough for livestock to eat until the wheat harvest next year. They harvested a total of more than 100,000 jin of fresh vegetables that they had diligently cultivated.

　　During the autumn harvest, the branch arranged early for both sunny and rainy plans, grasping grain with one hand and vegetables and grass with the other. Not a single soybean leaf or sweet potato vine was discarded, and the sweet potatoes were re-harvested three times. In order to harvest and dry the sweet potato vines well, the elderly people took the initiative to go to the lake to pull thatch and twist ropes. Fresh vegetables and dried melons were drying everywhere in the streets and alleys, on the roofs and walls, in the courtyards and yards, and on the stacks of trees. Although there were several cloudy and rainy days in the autumn, the melons and vegetables suffered no losses.

　　Save and Use Sparingly to Get Through the Disaster Year

　　Liu Huancai, a 73-year-old commune member, relied on his accumulated old disaster relief experience to offer the branch suggestions of saving and using sparingly, long-term planning, early preparation, and not waiting until there is no grain to worry. The branch adopted his opinion, and Deputy Secretary Liao Junhe personally took charge of running the canteen, and discussed ways to save grain with the commune members, implementing grain quotas to households, grain to the hall, eating with tickets, and saving for oneself. At the same time, the team's collective vegetable garden was expanded, the canteen vegetable garden was expanded, 160 mu of wheat land was also planted with spinach, and the commune members planted winter vegetables wherever they could find space in front of and behind their houses.

　　The Chudun People's Commune Party Committee, based on the severe flood damage in this production team, planned to supply them with some grain. The commune members were extremely grateful when they heard about it. After discussing it, they asked someone to send a letter to the Party Committee saying: Although our village has suffered a disaster, the arrangements for grain, vegetables, charcoal, and fodder are generally in place. It is better to supply the grain to the brother teams with greater difficulties.

　　Reduced Harvest This Year, Increased Production Next Year

　　The initial victory in the struggle against disaster and production further inspired people's fighting spirit. After the Party branch summarized the experience of the previous stage of disaster relief and production, it formulated a plan for winter production this year. According to the plan, one branch secretary and two branch committee members will focus on sideline production, weaving mats, weaving shoes, weaving baskets, making ropes, transporting, hunting, fishing... to achieve ten ways to generate income. In agricultural production, all 430 mu of winter fallow land were winter plowed; 40 mu of terraced fields were opened up. Combined with digging 2,000 jin of wild water chestnuts, the wheat this year was planted better than any other year. An additional 1,000 jin of base fertilizer was applied per mu compared to last year, and urea fertilizer was also applied as topdressing. Why did they put so much effort into spring sowing land and winter wheat? For one purpose: "Reduced harvest this year, increased production next year!"

　　As I was about to leave here, the commune members enthusiastically said: Comrade, the people's commune stands tall and firm, the cadres and commune members are of one mind, no disaster can scare us, wait to hear our good news of a bumper harvest next year!

    “等着听我们明年丰收喜讯吧”
    ——记廖家屯生产队领导抗灾斗争的事迹
          临沂大众报记者
      廖家屯，是山东郯城县褚墩公社的一个生产队。这里今年夏天遭受了严重的涝灾，可是现在庄里重灾的痕迹留得很少。
          四淹四种斗倒“老天”
    春玉米正在攻粒，夏地瓜刚扎下根，大豆才离地面的时候，这里突然下了一场大暴雨，全队百分之九十的地变成了一片汪洋。把水排出去以后，大豆全部被淹毁了。社员们抓紧时机又播种了一次，谁想到二次种下的
  豆子刚露土两个瓣又来了一场大水，工夫和种子又都白搭了。“种庄稼就是和天地打交道，风调雨顺的年成有多少？冲了还是种！”社员们斗志昂扬，又改种了绿豆等作物。三次播种的作物还没有出土，又来了一场大水。这时候，部分社员的情绪有些不正常了，有的说：
  “哪有这样的年成，老天成心不给吃了。”党支部发现这种情况，立即组织大家分析抗灾斗争的有利条件，坚定了大家的信心。怎样弥补灾害的损失？书记廖俊其向一个又一个的老年人请教。根据老“参谋”们的意见，决定再改种荞麦和秋菜。
      办法有了，决心也大了。书记廖俊其斩钉截铁地向社员们说：“向大自然夺粮就和打敌人一样，只要有决心有办法，没有打不胜的仗。”社员们的干劲鼓起来了，一致表示：灾大，干劲更大。一鼓作气种了第四次。以后，虽然又来了第四次水害，可是，很快被干部、社员们战胜了。经过排水、拔草、追肥，真像书记讲的那样，他们终于斗倒了“老天”。原来认为要绝产的一部分麦茬地瓜，由于管理得好，每亩还收了一千二百多斤；第三次种的豆子，一亩还打了八、九十斤哩。四种四淹，在夏秋之间降雨量达到一千一百七十毫米，全年还能够收到五十二万八千多斤粮食！这是党的领导的胜利，人民公社的胜利，群众斗争的胜利！
              粮食减收八处找补
      涝灾毕竟是太重了，尽管人们奋勇向天争粮，粮食产量还是比去年减收了三分之一。用什么办法来弥补损失呢？干部、党员和全体社员总结了历史上抗灾生产的经验，决定了“八下里找补”。这就是，洼地减产高地找，早秋减产晚秋找，粮食减产蔬菜找，农业减产副业找，秸穰减收野草找……。
    雨大草多，社员们采用了“下地带镰刀，回家捎一挑”的办法共收存下干青草九万多斤，猪饲料近两万斤，加上其他饲草，足够牲畜吃到明年麦收。他们辛勤培植起来的鲜菜，一共收了十万多斤。
      秋收的时候，支部及早安排了晴雨两套计划，一手抓粮食，一手抓菜、草。大豆叶、地瓜秧一点没丢，地瓜复收了三遍。为了收晒好地瓜秧，老年人主动到湖里拔茅草搓绳，满庄大街小巷、屋顶墙头、场里院内、树丫垛顶，到处晒着鲜菜、瓜干。秋天虽然有过几次阴雨，瓜、菜一点没受损失。
            省吃俭用好度灾年
    七十三岁的老社员刘焕才，就凭他积累的抗灾老经验，向支部献出了省吃俭用，细水长流，早打谱早安排，莫等无粮干着急的建议。支部采纳了他的意见，由副书记廖俊和亲自挂帅办食堂，并和社员们研究了节约用粮的办法，实行用粮指标到户、粮食到堂、凭票吃饭、节约归己。同时，队的集体菜园扩大了，食堂菜园扩大了，有一百六十亩麦地也种了菠菜，社员家前屋后见缝插针，大种越冬菜。
    褚墩公社党委根据这个生产队涝灾严重，打算供应一部分粮食给他们。社员们听说以后，感激得了不得，大家商量了一下，托人捎信给党委说：俺庄虽然受灾，但粮食、蔬菜、烧炭、饲草大体安排停当了，还是把粮食供应给困难大的兄弟队吧。
            今年减收明年增产
    生产抗灾斗争的初步胜利进一步鼓舞了人们的斗志。在党支部总结了前一阶段生产抗灾经验以后，订出了今年冬季生产的计划。根据计划，由一个支部书记、两个支部委员专抓副业生产，编席、编鞋、编筐、打绳、运输、打猎、捕鱼……做到十路进财。在农业生产上，四百三十亩冬闲地全部冬耕了；开整台田四十亩，结合挖两千斤野荸荠，今年小麦种得比哪年都好，每亩比去年多施了一千斤基肥，还追施了尿肥。他们为什么在春播地和冬小麦上这样使劲呢？为了一个目的：“今年减收，明年增产！”
    当我要离开这里的时候，社员们热情洋溢地说：同志啊，人民公社顶天立地，干部、社员一个心眼，什么灾害也吓不倒咱们，等着听我们明年大丰收的喜讯吧！
