Learning to Rely on the Masses: No More Hectic Work
Jin Wenjie, Fifth Squad Leader of Jinshang Production Team, Chongning Commune, Weinan, Shaanxi

I've been a squad leader for several years, and I've always wanted to do a good job. It's just that my work methods and ideological approach weren't quite right, so the work wasn't as good as it could be, and the commune members had some complaints.

This year in August, the county sent Comrade Jing Deshan to work here long-term, and I paid attention to learning his work methods. I noticed that he labored alongside the commune members every day, chatted and laughed with everyone during breaks, and often sought their opinions on production and work matters. Before long, he became as familiar with everyone as if he were family. At first, I thought he was just trying to build good relationships since he was new; who knew that this was how he grasped many of the practical issues in our team.

One day, he brought up all the issues he had learned about and discussed solutions with me. After we reached a consensus, we convened a meeting of work group leaders and commune member representatives, and everyone discussed and researched solutions together. For example, our labor quotas used to be insufficiently specific and somewhat unreasonable. After everyone studied it, they proposed various agricultural labor quotas and implemented a system of rewards for exceeding the quotas, which motivated the commune members to be more productive.

This matter was a great enlightenment to me. Afterward, I followed Comrade Jing Deshan's example. As a result, it was very effective. For example, in this year's "Three Autumns" work, I also widely solicited the opinions of commune members, set quotas for various tasks according to their importance and urgency, and arranged them in order. We also rationally allocated labor, divided it into groups, and assigned responsibilities to individuals. In this way, the commune members all had a clear idea of what was expected, and their enthusiasm increased. Because our labor and tasks were well-arranged, and the ideological work was more thorough than before, which motivated the commune members to work, the progress of various productions was rapid, and the quality was high. For example, pulling corn stalks, which was originally planned to take eight days to complete one hundred and sixty mu, was completed in six days. The production team also held an on-site meeting at our squad to promote our experience.

Because I rely on the masses in leading production in everything, I have truly achieved "a thousand-pound burden borne by all." Not only has production improved, but my own work is no longer hectic. (Attached picture)

### 学会依靠群众　工作再不忙乱

    学会依靠群众　工作再不忙乱
    陕西渭南崇凝公社靳尚生产队第五小队长　靳文杰
    我担任小队长好几年了，并且一心想把工作搞好。就是工作方法和思想方法不对头，结果工作做得不够出色，社员也有意见。
    今年8月份，县上派井德善同志，到我们这里长期工作，我就注意向他学习工作方法。我发现他每天都是和社员一起劳动，休息时和大家有说有笑，并经常征求社员对生产和工作方面的意见。不久，他就和大家熟悉得像一家人一样。起初，我还以为人家初来，是为了搞好群众关系；谁知道，他就是这样掌握了我们队里的许多实际问题。
    有一天，他把他所了解到的问题全都提了出来，和我商量解决的办法。我们取得一致意见以后，又召开了作业组长、社员代表会，大家一起商量，研究解决的办法。比如我们的劳动定额过去不够具体，不太合理，大家研究后，提出了各种农活定额，实行了超额奖励的制度，调动了社员的生产积极性。
    这件事，给我的启发很大。以后，我就照着井德善同志那样去作。结果，很灵验。比如在今年“三秋”工作中，我也广泛征求社员意见，把各种活路按照轻重缓急定出了定额，排出次序，并将劳力合理搭配，分成小组，责任落实到人。这样一来，社员心里都有了底，干劲也大了。由于我们的劳力、活路安排得好，加上思想工作较前做得深入，调动了社员的劳动积极性，各项生产的进度都很快，质量也高。像拔玉米秆，原计划八天完成一百六十亩，结果六天就完成了。生产队还在我们小队开了现场会，推广了我们的经验。
    由于我在领导生产中处处依靠群众，就真正做到“千斤担子众人担”，不但生产搞好了，自己的工作也再不忙乱。（附图片）
