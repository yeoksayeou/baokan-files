An Important Path to Developing Industry
	Use Less Coal, Produce More Steel
	Hefei promotes advanced experiences such as strong winds and high temperatures, reducing the coke ratio month by month, and steel production continues to be high.
	Anshan and Shenyang steel plants implement coke saving plans at all levels, and diligently improve operating techniques.
	(Our report) According to a report from the Anhui Daily: Metallurgical industrial workers in Hefei City, Anhui Province, have done everything possible to save coal and produce more steel. By the end of November, they had saved more than 100,000 tons of raw coal, which strongly promoted the continuous high production of steel.
	In the steelmaking process, the steel plants in Hefei City first did everything possible to reduce the coke ratio. The workers conscientiously implemented high-wind, high-temperature operating methods, which caused the ironmaking coke ratio to decrease month by month. Calculated by the amount of raw coke consumed per ton of iron produced, it decreased by 0.2 tons in August compared to July, 0.087 tons in September compared to August, 0.1 tons in October compared to September, and decreased again in November. Due to the continuous reduction in the coke ratio, steel plants throughout the city saved more than 5,000 tons of coke in October alone.
	In order to save raw coal, the workers of each coking plant made full use of coal slurry, anthracite, coke powder, and bottom coal for coking, increasing the production of more than 38,000 tons of coke. The Anhui Provincial Party Committee Steel Plant also generally used coke powder instead of raw coal as fuel in steel rolling heating, oil refining, and lime burning. In October alone, more than 3,600 tons of raw coal were saved. Metallurgical kiln plants use coke powder to burn bricks, which can save 1.5 tons of raw coal per 10,000 bricks.
	The metallurgical industrial workers also started by strengthening management to reduce the loss of coking coal. The steel plants have generally adjusted the transportation routes, so that the loss rate is continuously reduced in the process of loading, unloading, handling, and turning over the coke from the dedicated line to the furnace. After the adjustment, a steel plant of the local garrison reduced the entire number of loading, unloading, handling, and turning operations of coke from the dedicated line to the furnace from the original eight times to about two times, and the coke loss rate decreased by 12% compared with the past, saving more than 400 tons of coke per month.
	The steel plants also widely mobilized the masses to organize screening teams and commando teams to screen out small coke from coke powder and mix it into the furnace for ironmaking. More than 400 tons of small coke were screened out in one month, replacing good coke for ironmaking. The steel plants and coking plants also mobilized workers and their families to pick up broken coke in their spare time at special lines, freight yards, construction sites and other places.
	The advanced experience of saving coking coal was promoted in a timely manner in the steel plants, which promoted the general reduction of coking coal consumption. They successively promoted the advanced experience of hot air operation in converters and iron melting furnaces, as well as iron melting and steelmaking without baking furnaces, which greatly reduced coking coal consumption. The steel window factory promoted the method of rolling steel at one time, reducing coal consumption by more than 40%.
	The factories also carried out technical reforms to save coking coal. The coking plants continuously carried out reforms on the furnace type and operating techniques of the coking furnace, and adopted the method of strong fire burning and timely fire extinguishing to reduce the phenomenon of bottoming and coking. After the coal washing workers of the Hefei Coking Plant improved their operating techniques, the recovery rate of refined coal increased sharply from about 70% in the past to more than 80%, and the ash and sulfur content of refined coal were also greatly reduced, and the quality of coke was improved.
	(Our report) According to a report from the Liaoning Daily: The Anshan and Shenyang steel plants mobilized workers to actively save coking coal.
	Workers at Anshan Iron and Steel launched a competition to "use less coke and produce more iron", which reduced the coke ratio month by month. From August to early December, the average consumption of coke for each ton of pig iron was reduced from 1,390 kg from January to July to 633 kg, which was 767 kg less than the national plan. The coke saved in four months can meet the needs of smelting nearly 10,000 tons of pig iron.
	The plant conscientiously formulated a plan to reduce the coke ratio and save coke, and implemented the savings plan layer by layer to the furnaces and teams, while mobilizing workers to implement high-temperature, high-wind, fine-material, and heavy-load smelting methods. In the past, due to the adoption of dry dust removal, the wind temperature fluctuated high and low, and the coke ratio was very high. The workers of the Power Section changed the multi-tube dry dust removal to a water-sealed spray washing tower, which greatly reduced the impurities in the gas, and the wind temperature rapidly increased from 380 degrees to above 500 degrees. In the past, the electrode of the blower was small, the air volume was insufficient, and a lot of coke was wasted. In order to solve this key problem, the machine repair workers worked together to connect the blowers in parallel and in series, and the air volume increased from 12,000 cubic meters per hour to 16,000 cubic meters per hour, meeting the needs of the blast furnace. The workers also dug more than a dozen earthen kilns and roasted natural ore into artificial rich ore through earthen methods, which not only ensured high production but also reduced the coke ratio from a maximum of 2,000 kg in the past to about 700 kg. The workers also strengthened the management of coke before it entered the furnace and improved the charging system, which not only reduced coke consumption but also improved the charging speed.
	Encouraged by the slogan of "one ton of coal equals two tons, one ton of coke equals two tons", the workers of the Shenyang Iron and Steel Plant tried every means to reduce the coke ratio and save coke. From August to November alone, they saved more than 5,700 tons of good coal and more than 3,100 tons of coke.
	In order to mobilize the masses to save coking coal, the party committee secretary and factory director and other leading cadres of this factory led technicians to go deep into the front of the coking furnace, the front of the kiln, the blast furnace, and the front of the iron melting furnace to help each work section and group calculate the details and formulate savings plans. After the coking workshop formulated and implemented the fire burning and fire adjustment system and improved the preheating method, the temperature rose from 850 degrees to 950 degrees, which improved the coking rate and coke quality. The iron melting furnaces in each workshop conscientiously implemented the methods of full wind and sufficient pressure, and promptly blocked any air leaks, and ensured uniform material distribution and guaranteed particle size. Therefore, the steelmaking coke ratio in November decreased by 31.23% compared with October, and 281 kg less coke was used per ton of steel produced; the pig iron coke ratio also decreased from 1.145 in October to 1.05, and 95 kg less coke was used per ton of iron produced.

In order to reduce the sulfur content in pig iron, the workers promoted the operating methods of "skillful allocation, hot charging, fine adjustment, and rapid smelting", which reduced the sulfur content of coke to below 0.8.

    发展工业的一条重要途径
    少用煤炭  多炼钢铁
    合肥推广大风高温等先进经验，月月降低焦比，钢铁持续高产
    鞍山沈阳两钢铁厂层层落实节约焦炭计划，认真改进操作技术
    本报讯　据安徽日报消息：安徽省合肥市冶金工业职工，千方百计节约煤炭，多炼钢铁，到11月底止，节约了原煤十万多吨，有力地促进了钢铁的持续高产。
    合肥市各钢铁厂在炼铁过程中，首先千方百计地降低焦比。职工们认真执行大风、高温操作方法，使炼铁焦比月月下降。以每炼一吨铁所耗毛焦计算，8月份比7月份降低零点二吨，9月份比8月份降低零点零八七吨，10月份比9月份降低零点一吨，11月份又有所下降。由于焦比不断降低，全市各钢铁厂仅10月份就节约焦炭五千多吨。
    为了节约原煤，各炼焦厂职工充分利用煤泥、无烟煤、焦粉和撇底煤等搭配进行炼焦，共增产了三万八千多吨焦炭。中共安徽省委钢铁厂在轧钢加热、炼油、烧石灰等方面，还普遍利用焦炭粉末代替原煤作燃料，仅10月份就节约原煤三千六百多吨。冶金窑厂搭配焦粉烧砖，每万块砖就能节约原煤一点五吨。
    冶金工业职工们还从加强管理入手来减少焦煤的损耗。各钢铁厂一般都调整了运输线路，使焦炭在从专用线到入炉的装卸、搬运和翻堆等周转过程中，不断降低损耗率。经过调整，当地驻军的一座钢铁厂，把焦炭从专用线到入炉的整个装卸、搬运、翻堆次数，由原来八次减少到二次左右，焦炭损耗率比以前降低12％，每月可节约焦炭四百多吨。
    各钢铁厂还广泛发动群众组织筛选小组和突击队，从焦粉中筛出小焦搭配入炉炼铁。一个月就筛出小焦四百多吨，代替了好焦炼铁。各钢铁厂、炼焦厂并且发动职工及家属，利用业余时间到专用线、货场、工地等场所拣拾碎焦。
    节约焦煤的先进经验在各钢铁厂中及时得到了推广，促进了焦煤消耗普遍降低。他们先后推广了转炉、化铁炉热风操作以及不烘炉化铁、炼钢等的先进经验，使焦煤消耗大大降低。钢窗厂推广一次轧成钢材的办法，降低煤耗40％以上。
    各厂还大搞技术改革，节约焦煤。各炼焦厂对炼焦炉不断进行了炉型、操作技术等改革，采取大火猛烧、适时灭火办法，减少了撇底、化焦等现象。合肥炼焦厂洗煤职工改进操作技术后，精煤回收率由过去的70％左右猛增到80％以上，精煤含灰分和含硫量也大大降低，并提高了焦炭质量。
    本报讯　据辽宁日报消息：鞍山、沈阳两座钢铁厂发动职工群众积极节约焦煤。
    鞍山钢铁厂职工掀起了“少用焦炭多炼铁”的竞赛，使焦比逐月下降。从8月份到12月上旬，每炼一吨生铁，由1至7月平均使用一千三百九十公斤焦炭，降低到六百三十三公斤焦炭，比国家计划少用七百六十七公斤焦炭。四个月节省下来的焦炭，可供冶炼近万吨生铁之需。
    这个厂认真地制订了降低焦比、节约焦炭的计划，并且把节约计划层层落实到炉子、班组，同时发动职工贯彻执行高温、大风、精料、重负荷的冶炼方法。过去由于采取干式除尘，风温忽高忽低，焦比一直很高。动力科职工把多管干式除尘改为水封喷雾式洗涤塔，瓦斯中的杂质大大减少，风温由三百八十度迅速提高到五百度以上。过去鼓风机的电极小，风量不足，浪费不少焦炭。为了解决这一关键，机修工人群策群力，将鼓风机并联和串联起来，风量每小时由一万二千立方米提高到一万六千立方米，满足了高炉需要。职工们又挖了十多个土窑，把天然矿石经过土法焙烧，变成了人造富矿，不仅保证了高产，而且使焦比由过去最高达二千公斤迅速降低到七百公斤左右。职工们还加强了焦炭入炉前的管理工作和改进了装料制度，既减少了焦炭的耗损，又提高了装料的速度。
    沈阳钢铁厂职工在“一吨煤当两吨用、一吨焦当两吨使”的口号鼓舞下，多方设法降低焦比，节约焦炭，仅8月至11月，就节约好煤五千七百多吨和焦炭三千一百多吨。
    这个厂的党委书记和厂长等领导干部，为了发动群众节约焦煤，带领技术人员深入到炼焦炉前、窑前和高炉、化铁炉前，帮助各工段、小组算细账，制订节约计划。炼焦车间制订和执行了烧火、调火制度和改进了预热方法后，温度由八百五十度上升到九百五十度，提高了结焦率和焦炭质量。各车间化铁炉认真贯彻了满风、足压的方法，发现跑风及时堵塞，并作到分布料均匀、保证粒度等。因此，炼钢焦比11月份比10月份降低31.23％，每炼一吨钢少用二百八十一公斤焦炭；生铁焦比也由10月份的一点一四五，下降到一点零五，每炼一吨铁少用焦炭九十五公斤。（附图片）
    河南省水冶炼铁厂焦化车间展开了“少用煤多炼焦、用次煤炼好焦”的增产竞赛运动。职工们为了降低生铁中的含硫量，推行了“巧配、热装、细调、快炼”的操作方法，使焦炭含硫量降低到零点八以下。新华社记者  张青云摄
