    The Tatu Bridge Lies Horizontally, Iron Chains Cold

    This is a section of the Luding Bridge iron chain, reborn with rust.

    The Red Army on the Long March was blocked by the natural barrier of the Tatu River. The perilous Luding Iron索, hung high in the air, ten zhang high and several ten zhang long, guarded by enemy troops on the opposite side. The river below was deep and the water turbulent, with towering waves. The wooden planks on the bridge had been burned by the enemy, leaving only thirteen bare iron chains swaying in the cold wind. This was the only way forward.

    Twenty-two Red soldiers, armed with Mauser pistols, carrying sabers, and with twelve hand grenades strapped to their waists, led by Company Commander Liao Dazhu, braved the rain of bullets and fire, climbed the iron chains, and crossed the turbulent Tatu River. They opened the way forward for the Red Army's main force and opened the way forward for the revolution.

    大渡桥横铁索寒
    这是一节锈迹重生的泸定桥铁索。
    长征途中的红军，被天堑般的大渡河阻挡了进路。天险的泸定铁索，横空高悬，高十丈，长数十丈，对面有敌军重兵把守，桥下河深水急，波浪滔天，桥上的木板已被敌人烧毁，只剩下十三根赤裸裸的铁索在寒风中摇晃，这是唯一的进路。
    二十二个红色战士，手持驳壳枪，身背马刀，腰缠十二颗手榴弹，在廖大珠连长率领下，冒着弹雨和烈火，攀着铁索，跨过了波涛汹涌的大渡河。他们为红军大队人马打开了前进道路，为革命打开了前进的道路。
