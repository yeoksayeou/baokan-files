　　Wuxi's Forty Mechanical Factories Cooperate to Ensure Key Projects
　　The industrial leadership departments of Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, broke down industry boundaries and organized forty mechanical factories from the city's machinery, metallurgy, textile, and chemical systems to cooperate and accelerate the progress of key product support. According to the needs of each key product's support and the production conditions of each factory, they divided these mechanical factories into main engine factories, auxiliary machine factories, and component factories, forming a "one-dragon" cooperative system. The result of concentrating the city's forty mechanical factories on "annihilation warfare" has greatly accelerated the progress of key product support.
　　Fully Utilize All Sizes of Materials in Warehouses
　　The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant launched a mass movement throughout the plant's 170+ warehouses of different types (materials, tools, semi-finished products, collaborative parts, etc.) to involve workers in materials management and vigorously promote warehouse economic accounting to manage and use materials well. This year, the initiative of mobilizing warehouse workers to renovate defective products for automobile production alone amounted to 480,000 pieces, equivalent to the value of forty automobiles; and over 90% of the warehouses achieved consistency between accounts and actual stock.
　　Winter Timber Transportation Requires No Manpower or Horses from Rural Areas
　　Since the beginning of winter, the employees of the Nancha Forestry Bureau of the Yichun Forestry Administration have launched a technical revolution movement centered on developing new timber collection tools, creating and promoting nearly a hundred types of new timber collection tools, realizing mechanized, semi-mechanized, and continuous operations in timber collection. In the tense winter transportation period, without requiring any manpower or horses from rural areas, the bureau had completed 130% of its monthly timber collection plan by November 20th.
　　Mudanjiang Small Coal Kilns' Daily Transportation Volume Increases Sixfold
　　In order to achieve basic self-sufficiency in local coal use, the Mudanjiang area of Heilongjiang Province has concentrated manpower and material resources since October to vigorously promote the transportation work of local small coal kilns. The average daily transportation volume of local small kiln coal in the whole area was 230 tons from January to September, rose to over 1,000 tons in October, and reached 7,184 tons by November 15th.
　　Shashi Widely Carries Out Repair and Assembly of Machinery Activities
　　Shashi, Hubei, has organized more than 200 repair and assembly service workshops, stores, and teams in all walks of life, as well as mobile repair and assembly service vehicles and shoulder-pole services, to widely carry out repair and assembly of machinery activities. Many production units have reasonably arranged labor and organized special workshops, teams, and workers to do repair and assembly work, producing whatever they can repair and assemble; many units have also dispatched technical workers with tools to the countryside to repair agricultural tools and machinery on the spot. All repair and assembly units also strive to provide fast repairs, simple procedures, low fees, and guaranteed use, which have been welcomed by the masses.
　　Modifying Designs Saves Large Amounts of Funds and Labor
　　Wuhan's design institutes vigorously promote "three-way combination," inspecting and modifying engineering designs simultaneously. In the past three months, six units inspected a total of 313 engineering designs, over 1,000 kilometers of railway lines, and five marshalling stations. After preliminary modifications, under the principle of not reducing usage requirements, they saved 137.7 million yuan in investment and a large amount of raw materials.
　　Xining Agricultural Machinery Factory Actively Produces Spring耕Implements
　　Workers at the Xining Agricultural Machinery Factory in Qinghai Province are producing more and better spring plowing implements. Starting in October, this factory actively arranged the production of spring plowing implements for next year. So far, it has produced more than 2,000 units (pieces) of tractor-drawn three-bottom plows, two-bottom plows, five-bottom plows, tractor-drawn heavy-duty notched harrows, twelve-disc harrows, as well as small agricultural implements such as pickaxes and iron shovels, and has begun to ship them successively. In order to improve the efficiency of spring plowing implements, the factory leadership has also stepped up the organization of product support.
