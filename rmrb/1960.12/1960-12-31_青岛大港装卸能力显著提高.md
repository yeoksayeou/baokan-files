The employees of the Dagang Loading and Unloading District of the Qingdao Maritime Bureau have vigorously consolidated, promoted, and improved the achievements of the technological revolution. Since the beginning of this year, they have realized a total of 481 technological innovation projects, of which 464 have been put into production, accounting for 96.5%. As a result, the port's loading and unloading capacity has been greatly improved. Compared with last year, the volume of key materials transported has increased by 26.92%, work shift efficiency has increased by 61.32%, labor productivity has increased by 63.1%, and the average total loading and unloading time of ships in port has been shortened by 18.62%, including a 48.37% reduction in the loading and unloading time of 10,000-ton coal ships. In terms of train loading and unloading, the average loading and unloading time per wagon has been shortened by 50.5% compared with the same period last year, and the average number of loading and unloading workers has been reduced by 17.52%.

    The Party General Branch of this loading and unloading district attaches great importance to consolidating, promoting, and improving the achievements of the technological revolution. In the first and second quarters, after the employees created and successfully trial-produced various indigenous and foreign loading and unloading machinery and tools such as earthen derricks, car unloading machines, and belt conveyors, they launched a mass movement to consolidate, promote, and improve the achievements of technological innovation, and focused on key technological innovation projects. For example, in response to the large increase in loading and unloading tasks, they focused on the technological transformation of coal loading, unloading, and transportation, basically realizing the mechanization and semi-mechanization of coal unloading operations. As a result, they continuously set high-yield monthly records in October and November, with coal unloading taking less than an hour, and setting a new record of loading a 10,000-ton coal ship in two hours and forty-five minutes.

    In order to continuously consolidate and improve the achievements of technological innovation, the district also promptly strengthened the management, maintenance, and upkeep of innovative machinery. They established and improved more than ten types of management and usage systems, safety operating procedures, and maintenance systems, fixing the management and usage methods of various machines with systems, making them easy for workers to learn, understand, and master. They also ensured good use of the machinery by improving as they used them, and by frequently checking, maintaining, and repairing them. At the same time, they adjusted the labor organization, establishing tunnel loading and unloading teams, train loading and unloading teams, and ship loading and unloading teams, achieving specialization in car unloading and ship loading.

    青岛大港装卸能力显著提高
    本报讯　青岛海运局大港装卸区职工，大力巩固、推广、提高技术革命成果，今年以来，共实现技术革新项目四百八十一件，投入生产的有四百六十四件，占96.5％，因此大大提高了港口装卸能力。同去年相比，重点物资运量提高26.92％，工班效率提高61.32％，劳动生产率提高63.1％，船舶在港总平均装卸时间缩短18.62％，其中万吨煤船装卸时间缩短48.37％。在火车装卸方面，总平均装卸车分比去年同期缩短50.5％，总平均装卸工人数减少17.52％。
    这个装卸区党总支非常重视巩固、推广、提高技术革命成果工作。在第一、二季度中，当职工创造和试制成功土吊杆、卸车机、皮带机等多种土洋装卸机械工具后，他们就开展了巩固、推广、提高技术革新成果的群众运动，并狠抓技术革新的重点项目。如根据装卸任务的大量增加，重点抓住了煤炭装卸车船的技术改造，使卸煤操作基本实现了机械化、半机械化。因此，10、11两月份连创卸车不过小时高产月，和二小时四十五分装一艘万吨煤船的新纪录。
    为了不断巩固提高技术革新成果，这个区还及时加强了革新机械的管理和维修保养工作，他们建立健全了十余种管理使用制度、安全操作规程和维修保养制度，把各种机械的管理使用方法用制度固定下来，使工人易学、易懂、易于掌握，并做到边使用、边改进和勤检查、勤保养修理，保证了机械的良好使用状态。同时调整了劳动组织，分别成立了坑道装卸队、火车装卸队和船舶装卸队，实现了卸车、装船专业化。
