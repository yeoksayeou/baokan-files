    Increase Production of “Brand Name” Farm Tools

    Various regions have some "brand name" farm tools. They are lightweight and durable, and are welcomed by the majority of farmers. The Handan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently organized a group of cadres and technicians to go to key counties, communes, and production teams to investigate the needs of the rural areas for agricultural tools. Farmers hope to supply more "brand name goods." The "brand name goods" in Handan City include the sickles and scissors from Chengu in Yongnian County, the kitchen knives from Linzhang in Ci County, and the wooden harrows from Shuguan Commune in Daming County. According to the demands of the masses, the Municipal Party Committee has determined the production tasks for these products and has given appropriate consideration to the supply of raw materials. The Municipal Party Committee also organized skilled craftsmen from various places to go to the "brand name goods" production units to learn from their experience. In this way, the production of "brand name goods" can be supported, so that the majority of farmers can use the most favorite and high-quality agricultural tools.

    Products that have been famous in the Handan area for many years include the "Meng Yi Mo" sickle from Linqing, Shandong, the plowshare from Qingfeng County, Henan Province, and the hoe blade from Huolu County, Hebei Province. These popular products have not been supplied much in recent years. It is hoped that the relevant regions will produce more of these "brand name goods," that the commercial departments will do a good job in supplying these products, and that the relevant departments will organize the exchange of production experience of "brand name" farm tools, so that the majority of farmers can have more handy tools in large-scale production.

    增产“名牌”农具
    各个地区都有一些“名牌”农具。它们具有轻巧、耐用等特点，受到广大农民的欢迎。中共邯郸市委最近组织一批干部、技术人员到重点县、社、生产队，调查了农村需要农具的情况。农民们希望多供应一些“名牌货”。邯郸市的“名牌货”，有永年县陈固的镰刀、剪子，磁县临漳的菜刀，大名县束馆公社的木耙等。市委根据群众的要求，确定了这些产品的生产任务，并在原料材料供应方面适当照顾。市委还组织各地能工巧匠到“名牌货”的生产单位取经学艺。这样，可以扶植“名牌货”的生产，使广大农民用上最喜爱的质量高的农具。
    历年来在邯郸地区著名的产品，还有山东临清的“猛一摸”镰刀，河南省清丰县的犁铧，河北省获鹿县的锄板。这些受欢迎的产品，近年来都供应不多。希望有关地区多生产些这样的“名牌货”，希望商业部门作好这些产品的供应工作，希望有关部门组织交流“名牌”农具的生产经验，让广大农民在大生产中有更多得心应手的工具。
