Xinhua News Agency, December 14th, Algiers dispatch: In the French-occupied areas of Algeria, the people valiantly persisted in their patriotic and just struggle against French colonial rule on the 13th and 14th. They were fearless in the face of the bloody suppression by the French colonialists.

    In Algiers, the central city where the French colonialists were entrenched, heroic Algerians continued to hold funerals in various districts on the 13th for the martyred heroes. Under the threat of machine guns and armored vehicles of the colonial military police, they fearlessly held high the Algerian flag, shouting slogans such as "Algeria for the Algerians," "Long Live the National Liberation Front," and held demonstrations. The walls of Algiers were covered with slogans such as "Eliminate all colonialism," "Long Live the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria," and "Long Live the Algerian National Liberation Front," which terrified the colonialists. On the afternoon of the 13th, all Muslim shops in the city closed their doors in a strike to mourn the patriotic martyrs.

    On the evening of the 13th, a new tide of struggle erupted in the Casbah district (the Muslim residential area of Algiers), which was heavily surrounded by more than 25,000 French colonial military police. Thousands upon thousands of Casbah residents poured into the streets, some delivering speeches, some waving the Algerian flag, shouting slogans demanding independence, and parading in the district all night long. Many women stood on the rooftops, constantly shouting traditional Algerian morale-boosting calls, encouraging men to join the struggle.

    On the morning of the 14th, the French colonial authorities ordered a large number of colonial military police to enter the Casbah district, divide and surround the demonstrating masses, and carry out new massacres. According to Agence France-Presse, more than 4,000 Casbah residents took up wooden sticks and fought heroically with the fully armed colonial military police. The French colonial authorities strictly sealed off the area, preventing reporters and anyone from entering. Western news agencies said that the French colonialists were conducting a "comprehensive search" in the Casbah district, killing and wounding residents in large numbers.

    In Oran, Bone, Blida, and other cities, mass demonstrations against French colonial rule continued to erupt on the 13th. In the city of Blida, hundreds of Algerians held demonstrations, shouting slogans of Algeria for the Algerians.

    The French colonial authorities continued to open fire and suppress the anti-French struggle of the Algerians. According to Agence France-Presse, the French authorities admitted that 18 more people were killed in Oran on the 13th, more than 100 were injured, and more than 300 were arrested. In Bone, the colonialists killed several demonstrators carrying the Algerian flag and injured nearly 50 people. The French colonial authorities also arrested a large number of Algerian patriots in these cities.

    The French De Gaulle government's massacre of Algerians has been condemned by the French working people.

    The French Communist Party issued a statement condemning De Gaulle's suppression of the Algerian people and called on the people to oppose De Gaulle's so-called "referendum" fraud on the Algerian issue. The French General Confederation of Labor issued a statement protesting the French government's atrocities against Arabs in Algeria. The statement said that recent events in Algeria eloquently prove the strong support of the Algerian masses for the national liberation movement. The French General Confederation of Labor called on all French workers to strengthen their common struggle to stop the unjust colonial war waged by the French colonialists in Algeria. Workers in many factories in the Vitry district of the suburbs of Paris held rallies in support of the Algerian people's struggle. Youths in the French departments of Seine and Marne held a march on the 13th against the colonial war in Algeria, and 20 demonstrators were arrested. In the past two days, thousands of people in these two provinces have signed petitions against the colonial war in Algeria.

    The heroic struggle of the people in the French-occupied areas of Algeria has caused great shock among the French ruling clique. On the 12th, prices on the Paris stock market plummeted. Among them, the stocks of French plantations and oil companies in Africa fell the most. Algerian and Saharan oil stocks fell by 5% to 10%.

    Under the head-on blows of the Algerian people, French President De Gaulle ended his trip to Algeria one day earlier on the evening of the 13th and scurried back to Paris. According to United Press International, French officials who accompanied De Gaulle on his "inspection" of North Africa said that De Gaulle was "enraged" by the patriotic demonstrations of the Algerian people, and he shouted, "I will crush them." This news agency revealed that De Gaulle had studied measures to suppress the Algerian people with French High Commissioner in Algeria, Morane, and French Commander-in-Chief in North Africa, Crepin.

    Xinhua News Agency, December 14th, New York dispatch: Algerian Provisional Government Minister of Information Yazid said on the 13th, when talking about the recent bloody suppression of the Algerian people by France, "The situation in Algeria in recent days proves that France's policy is to eliminate the Algerian people."

    Yazid reported at a meeting of the Asian-African group at the United Nations that the French authorities' new bloody suppression of the Algerian people has caused thousands of Algerian deaths and injuries, most of whom have been killed.

    Yazid condemned France, which had committed new crimes, for attempting to minimize the number of Algerian casualties. (Attached picture)

    殖民者的血腥镇压激起新的斗争怒潮
    阿尔及尔市人民同法国军警英勇搏斗
    奥兰、波尼等地群众继续示威游行殖民当局又在各地进行新的屠杀
    新华社14日讯　阿尔及尔消息：阿尔及利亚法国占领区人民13、14日英勇地坚持反抗法国殖民统治的爱国正义斗争。他们在法国殖民者的血腥镇压面前一无畏惧。
    在法国殖民者盘踞的中心城市阿尔及尔，英勇的阿尔及利亚人13日继续在各区为死难的烈士举行葬礼。他们在殖民军警机枪、装甲车的威胁下，毫无畏色地高举阿尔及利亚的国旗、高呼“阿尔及利亚人的阿尔及利亚”、“民族解放阵线万岁”等口号，举行示威游行。阿尔及尔各处的墙壁上写满了“消灭一切殖民主义”、“阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府万岁”、“阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线万岁”等标语，使殖民主义者为之胆战心惊。13日下午，全市穆斯林商店都关门罢市，为死难爱国志士志哀。
    13日晚上，在两万五千多名法国殖民军警严密包围的卡斯巴区（阿尔及尔穆斯林住区）爆发了新的斗争的怒潮。成千成万的卡斯巴居民涌上街头，有人发表演说，有人挥舞着阿尔及利亚的国旗，高呼着要求独立的口号，通宵达旦地在区内游行。许多妇女站在屋顶上不停地高喊着阿尔及利亚人传统的鼓舞士气的呼号，激励男人去参加斗争。
    14日清晨，法国殖民当局命令大批殖民军警开进卡斯巴区，分割包围示威群众，进行新的屠杀。据法新社报道，四千多卡斯巴居民拿起木棍同全副武装的殖民军警英勇搏斗。法国殖民当局严密封锁这个地区不让记者和任何人进去。西方通讯社说，法国殖民者正在卡斯巴区进行“全面的搜捕”，大批杀伤居民。
    在奥兰、波尼、布利达等城市，13日也继续爆发了反对法国殖民统治的群众示威。在布利达城，数百名阿尔及利亚人举行示威游行，高呼阿尔及利亚人的阿尔及利亚的口号。
    法国殖民当局继续开枪镇压阿尔及利亚人的反法斗争。据法新社报道，法国官方承认，13日又在奥兰打死了十八人，打伤一百多人，逮捕了三百多人。在波尼，殖民者打死了几个拿着阿尔及利亚国旗游行的示威者，打伤了将近五十人。法国殖民当局在这些城市中还逮捕了大批阿尔及利亚爱国者。
    法国戴高乐政府对阿尔及利亚人的屠杀受到法国劳动人民的谴责。
    法国共产党发表声明谴责戴高乐对阿尔及利亚人民的镇压，号召人民反对戴高乐就阿尔及利亚问题举行所谓“公民投票”的骗局。法国总工会发表声明抗议法国政府对阿尔及利亚的阿拉伯人的暴行。声明说，阿尔及利亚最近的事件雄辩地证明了阿尔及利亚群众对民族解放运动的强有力的支持。法国总工会号召全体法国劳动者加强共同斗争，制止法国殖民者在阿尔及利亚进行的非正义的殖民战争。巴黎市郊维特利区许多工厂的工人举行了支持阿尔及利亚人民斗争的集会。法国塞纳省和马恩省的青年13日举行了反对在阿尔及利亚进行殖民战争的游行，有二十名示威者被捕。这两个省里最近两天还有数千人签名反对在阿尔及利亚进行殖民战争。
    阿尔及利亚法占区人民英勇的斗争在法国统治集团中引起极大震动。12日，巴黎股票市场价格猛烈下跌。其中以法国在非洲的种植园和石油公司的股票跌得最多。阿尔及利亚和撒哈拉石油股票跌价5％到10％。
    在阿尔及利亚人民的迎头痛击下，法国总统戴高乐已在13日晚上提前一天匆匆结束了他的阿尔及利亚之行，溜回巴黎。据合众国际社报道，随从戴高乐“视察”北非的法国官员说，戴高乐对阿尔及利亚人民的爱国示威“勃然大怒”，他叫嚷说，“我要粉碎他们”。这家通讯社透露戴高乐曾与法国驻阿尔及利亚总代表摩兰及法国驻北非总司令克雷班研究了镇压阿尔及利亚人民的措施。
    新华社14日讯　纽约消息：阿尔及利亚临时政府宣传部长亚齐德13日在谈到最近几天来法国对阿尔及利亚人民的血腥镇压时说，“阿尔及利亚最近几天来的局势证明，法国的政策是要消灭阿尔及利亚人民。”
    亚齐德在联合国亚非集团的会议上报告说，法国当局对阿尔及利亚人民的新的血腥镇压已经使阿尔及利亚人死伤几千名，其中大部分人被杀死了。
    亚齐德谴责犯下新罪行的法国企图缩小阿尔及利亚人的伤亡人数。（附图片）
