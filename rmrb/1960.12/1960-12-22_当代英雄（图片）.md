    Contemporary Hero
    Wang Genliang, a young fitter at the Shanghai Sixth Textile Machinery Factory and a national advanced worker, insists on continuous revolution. In addition to actively tackling key problems, he also pays attention to small measures and small improvements. Since 1958, he has overfulfilled his production plan every year. This year, he has achieved the outstanding result of completing eight years and five months of work in eight months, and all the parts he processed are qualified. Wang Genliang (left one) is helping Wu Guomin (right two) and others to reform the winding machine.
