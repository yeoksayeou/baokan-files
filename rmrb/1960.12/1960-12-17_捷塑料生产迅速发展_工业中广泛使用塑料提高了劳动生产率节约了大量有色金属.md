Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Czechoslovakia's plastic production is developing rapidly. This year, plastic production will reach 57,000 tons (excluding raw materials used for manufacturing artificial fibers). The per capita output is 4.2 kilograms, an increase of more than 60% compared to 1958.

Due to the rapid increase in production, the use of plastics in industry has reached an unprecedented extent. Approximately 30% of the total plastic production is used for industrial purposes. In machinery manufacturing and other industries, plastics have been used to manufacture bearing bushings, pipes, chemical equipment, and telecommunications equipment, as well as materials for corrosion protection of metals. In the cable manufacturing industry alone, more than 4,000 tons of polyvinyl chloride will be used this year.

The widespread use of plastics in industry has great economic value. On average, the use of one ton of plastic can save three to four tons of non-ferrous metals. At the Lenin Factory in Pilsen, a plastic sheet of glass is used to replace the cast iron gearbox cover. This glass cover weighs only 14 kilograms, while a metal cover weighs as much as 200 kilograms. Due to the use of plastic as a raw material, the production technology of many jobs has been simplified, and labor productivity has greatly improved. For example, when metal was used to manufacture spiral plugs in the past, a worker could only produce 24 pieces per shift. Now, after using plastic as a raw material, a worker can press 1,200 to 1,800 pieces per shift. As a result of using plastics in the cable industry, labor productivity has increased by approximately 45%.

In the construction industry, plastics have also begun to be used to replace traditional materials, especially in the manufacture of partitions, floors, pipes, bathrooms, and kitchen equipment. Plastic products also have strong anti-corrosion capabilities.

    工业中广泛使用塑料提高了劳动生产率节约了大量有色金属
    据新华社讯　捷克斯洛伐克塑料生产迅速发展，今年生产的塑料将达五万七千吨（不包括制造人造纤维用的原料）。按人口平均计算的产量为四点二公斤，比1958年增加了60％以上。
    由于生产量的迅速提高，目前工业中对塑料的使用已达到空前广泛的程度。用于工业的塑料约占全部塑料产量的30％。在机械制造和其他一些工业中，塑料已被用来制造轴承衬套、管子、化学设备和电讯设备以及防止腐蚀保护金属的材料。仅电缆制造工业中，今年就将使用四千吨以上的聚氯乙烯。
    工业中广泛使用塑料具有很大经济价值。平均使用每一吨的塑料可以节省三到四吨的有色金属。在比尔森的列宁工厂，用一种塑料制的玻璃薄板来代替生铁制齿轮箱盖，这种玻璃盖子的重量只有十四公斤，而一个用金属做的盖子则重达二百公斤。由于使用塑料为原料，许多工作的生产技术简化了，劳动生产率随之大大提高。例如过去螺旋塞子用金属制造时，一个工人每一班只能生产二十四个，现在改用塑料为原料后，一个工人每一班能用塑料压出一千二百个到一千八百个。电缆工业使用塑料的结果，劳动生产率提高大约45％。
    在建筑工业中，也已经开始使用塑料来代替传统的材料，特别在制造隔墙、地板、管子、浴室和厨房的设备等方面。塑料制品还具有很强的防腐能力。
