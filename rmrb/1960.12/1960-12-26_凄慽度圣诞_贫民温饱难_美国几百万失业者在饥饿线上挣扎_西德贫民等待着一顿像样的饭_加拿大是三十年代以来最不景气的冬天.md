Bleak Christmas: The Poor Struggle to Survive
Millions of Unemployed Americans Struggle on the Brink of Starvation; West German Poor Await a Decent Meal; Canada Experiences Its Worst Winter Since the 1930s

    America is experiencing a "Christmas" this year that angers both God and man.

    The economic crisis is increasingly assaulting the United States, and American working people are facing the abyss of mass unemployment and poverty. Millions of unemployed American families are living on meager "unemployment benefits," struggling on the brink of starvation. Especially in some "depressed areas" where the number of unemployed accounts for more than 6% of the total labor force, the situation is even more miserable. *Newsweek* recently reported that in southern Illinois, 20,000 out of 80,000 people are unemployed. A local Chamber of Commerce member said, "We are like a graveyard here." Even those who are fortunate enough to have jobs are constantly worried about employers shortening working hours to reduce wages and the threat of being laid off. *The Wall Street Journal*, quoting some materials to describe the "anxiety about career prospects caused by the economic recession" among Americans, said, "People do not know what jobs they will be doing after the beginning of next year... Some people do not even know if they will have a job next year." *Business Week* also said that the employment situation in the United States is deteriorating, "It seems certain that after Christmas, layoffs will push the number of unemployed over five million."

    On the one hand, there is the threat of unemployment and declining income, and on the other hand, there is the continuous rise in living costs. This is like a pair of iron pincers attacking the vast number of American working people from both sides. According to the US government's announcement on the 23rd, since the beginning of this year, the cost of living in the United States has risen almost every month. In November, the cost of living index rose to an unprecedented peak of 127.4 (with the average for 1947-1949 being 100). Food prices, medical expenses, and even movie ticket prices are all rising. Some American newspapers and periodicals admit that due to the monopoly capitalists' efforts to raise prices to seek profits, the cost of living in the United States will continue to rise.

    Due to the attacks of unemployment and poverty on the vast number of working people, this year's "Christmas" market in the United States appears particularly bleak. The Associated Press said that this year's Christmas shopping activity in the United States "started off slowly." *The Wall Street Journal* said, "Reports of sluggish sales come from almost every region." A retailer in Boston said that it seems to be "a very poor Christmas."

    Looking at the bottom of the society in this country called the "economic miracle" through the West German press reveals a bleak and arduous scene where the working masses live like years.

    For more than a month, many West German bourgeois newspapers have been constantly calling on "good-hearted people" to donate clothes and food so that people with financial difficulties can "share a little Christmas joy." *Frankfurter Rundschau* said in such an "appeal", "In this prosperous and outwardly glorious world, the disaster is profound..." The newspaper said that everywhere one can hear requests from cold houses and "windy basements." People there are waiting for "a warm piece of clothing and a decent meal."

    *Süddeutsche Zeitung* recently reported on the bleak situation of a twenty-six-year-old widow living with three children. The newspaper wrote that her husband was originally a taxi driver and died of illness in August this year. The only savings were used for funeral expenses. Because the issue of relief money has not been resolved until now, the family of four has to live on debt. Now, her seven-year-old son suffers from tonsillitis, her five-year-old daughter has pneumonia, and her two-and-a-half-year-old daughter is also coughing.

    The mother said that she did not want to think about Christmas at all, because it meant greater misery for her, because the children's wishes could not be fulfilled. The older child said he wanted a warm blanket. The five-year-old daughter has lost the joy of life and often says to her mother: "I want to die, because then I can go to 'heaven' and be with my dad."

    According to *Deutsche Zeitung und Wirtschaftszeitung*, there are now 1.1 million people in West Germany living on relief money, and the Bonn government's stipulated relief standard is only 78 to 95 marks per month. At the same time, there are many poor people who do not receive any state subsidies at all.

    In contrast to the plight of the vast number of working people, many former Nazis are well cared for by the Adenauer government. These Nazis still receive high "pensions" and "subsidies" from the Bonn government under various names today. For example, Schloeb, State Secretary and Minister of Justice during Hitler's time, now receives a "subsidy" of 2,800 marks per month.

    Recently, on the newspapers and television screens in Canada, on the shop windows and colorful advertisements, one can see the slogans "Merry Christmas" everywhere. However, for those Canadian unemployed who are heartbroken by the question of "where to find a job" all day long, Christmas is harsh.

    As the economic crisis deepens, the problem of unemployment in Canada is also becoming more and more serious. Currently, almost one in fifteen employees is unemployed. It is estimated that by February or March next year, the army of unemployed will reach at least 600,000, accounting for 10% to 12% of the national labor force. *The Canadian Forum* said that this winter is the most depressed winter since the 1930s. However, the supplementary budget submitted to Parliament by the government recently did not stipulate any emergency measures to address the unemployment problem.

    Bru, who lost his job half a year before Christmas, described his heavy mood like this: "It is very sad when you wake up in the morning when you know exactly what the day will bring you. Loafing around in the morning, looking for work everywhere in the afternoon, that's how I spend my day."

    Millen, an unemployed person in Windsor, said: "I look for work everywhere, but the only answer I get is: 'We need younger people.' It turns out that I am already too old at twenty-eight."

    *Toronto Daily Star* wrote that for hundreds of thousands of Canadians, Christmas is bleak and winter is cold.

    凄慽度圣诞　贫民温饱难
    美国几百万失业者在饥饿线上挣扎　西德贫民等待着一顿像样的饭　加拿大是三十年代以来最不景气的冬天
    美国今年正在度着一个天怒人怨的“圣诞节”。
    经济危机日益严重地袭击着美国，美国劳动人民面临着大批失业和贫困的深渊。几百万失业的美国家庭靠着微不足道的“失业救济金”度日，正在饥饿线上挣扎。特别在一些失业人数占全部劳动力6％以上的“萧条地区”，那里人们的处境更是凄惨。《新闻周刊》最近就报道说，在伊利诺斯州南部，八万人中就有二万人失业，当地的商会人员说，“我们这里像一个坟场。”就算那些侥幸还有工作的人们，由于雇主缩短工时以压低工资和被解雇的威胁，也是惶惶不可终日。《华尔街日报》在引用一些材料描述美国人“由于经济衰退而产生的对职业前景的忧虑”说，“人们现在并不知道明年开年以后会干什么工作……一些人并且不知道他们在明年是否还有工作做”。《商业周刊》也说，美国的就业情况正在恶化，“看来肯定的是，在圣诞节以后，解雇将使失业人数超过五百万”。
    一方面是失业威胁和收入下降，一方面却是生活费用不断上升，这就像一把铁钳一样从两方面夹击着美国广大劳动人民。据美国政府23日宣布，今年以来，美国的生活费用差不多逐月上涨。在11月份，生活费用指数已上升到一百二十七点四（1947—1949年的平均数为一百）的空前未有的最高峰。食品价格、医疗费用以至电影票价等都在上涨。美国一些报刊承认，由于垄断资本竭力抬高物价来牟取利润，美国的生活费用还会继续上升。
    由于广大劳动人民遭受失业和贫困的袭击，美国今年“圣诞节”的市场因而显得格外清淡。美联社说，今年美国的圣诞节购买活动“一开头就是慢吞吞的”。《华尔街日报》说，“关于销售不振的报告差不多来自各个地区”。波士顿一个零售商说，看来这“是一个非常可怜的圣诞节”。
    通过西德报刊来透视一下这个被称为“经济奇迹”的国家的社会底层，是劳苦大众度日如年的一片凄凉艰辛景象。
    近一个多月来，西德许多资产阶级报纸不断呼吁“好心人”捐助衣物和食品，让生活困难的人“分享一点圣诞节的欢乐”。《法兰克福评论报》在一篇这样的“呼吁”里说，“在这个繁荣和外部光辉的世界里，灾难是深重的……”报纸说，到处都可以听到来自阴冷的房子里，来自“充满冷风的地下室”的要求。那里的人们在等待着“一件温暖的衣服和一顿像样的饭”。
    《南德意志报》最近报道了一个二十六岁的寡妇带着三个孩子度日的凄凉景况。报纸写道，她丈夫原来是个出租汽车司机，今年8月间得病死去。仅有的一点积蓄都作了丧葬费。由于直到现在救济金问题还没有解决，一家四口只得靠借债度日。现在，她的七岁的儿子患着扁桃腺炎，五岁的女儿患肺炎，两岁半的小女儿也在咳嗽。
    这位母亲说，她根本不愿想到圣诞节，这对她意味着更大的凄苦，因为孩子们的愿望没法满足。大孩子说他想有一条暖和的毯子。五岁的女儿失去了生活的乐趣，常对妈妈说：“我愿意死，因为那样我就可以上‘天堂’去，同爸爸在一起了。”
  据《德意志报与经济报》报道，西德现在有一百一十万人靠救济金生活，而波恩政府规定的救济金标准每月只有七十八至九十五马克。同时还有许多穷人根本得不到国家的任何补助。
    同广大劳苦人民的这种处境相反，许多前纳粹分子却为阿登纳政府关怀备至。这些纳粹分子今天还以各种名义从波恩政府领着高额的“抚恤金”和“补助金”。例如希特勒时期的国务秘书和司法部长施勒贝格，现在每月就领着二千八百马克的“补助金”。
    近日来，在加拿大的报纸和电视机萤光屏上，在商店的橱窗和五光十色的广告上，到处都可以看到“祝圣诞节幸福”的字标。但是，对那些成天被“哪里去找工作”的问题折磨得心碎的加拿大失业者来说，圣诞节是严酷的。
    随着经济危机越来越深重，加拿大失业的问题也越来越严重。目前几乎每十五个职工中就有一个人失业。据估计，到明年2、3月份，失业大军至少要达到六十万人，即占全国劳动力的10％到12％。《加拿大论坛报》说，今年的冬天是三十年代以来最不景气的一个冬天。然而，政府最近提交议会的补充预算案却没有规定对失业问题采取任何紧急措施。
    圣诞节前夕半年前就失去工作的布鲁这样描述他沉重的心情说：“当你确切地知道一天将会给你带来什么的时候，你早晨醒来时是很难过的。上午闲逛，下午到处寻找工作，我的一天就是这样虚度过去的。”
    文索尔市的失业者米伦说：“我到处寻找工作，可是得到的回答只有一个：‘我们需要更年青的人。’原来，我二十八岁就已经太老了。”
    《多伦多每日星报》写道，对成千上万的加拿大人来说，圣诞节是凄凉的，冬天是寒冷的。
