    Red Technician Chen Baolan

    Chen Baolan, who was named a National "March 8th" Red Banner Pacesetter and a Jiangxi Province Clever Sister, was a student before being sent down to Damaoshan. When she first arrived in Damaoshan, she couldn't even lift a bucket of water. However, after a period of labor training, she became stronger and stronger, becoming a glorious member of the Communist Youth League and a technician.

    Last year, Chen Baolan was transferred to the edible fungi seed factory to learn how to cultivate菌种 (junzhong; strains). Originally, she didn't know anything about biology, chemistry, bacteria, inoculation... She didn't understand many complex instruments and medicines even more. However, she was determined to study hard and quickly master the technology. She bought some books on菌种 (junzhong; strains) cultivation herself, and when she didn't understand something, she asked the veteran comrades for advice. When others rested, she squatted in the laboratory to ponder and observe, studying diligently. In this way, she gradually learned some basic knowledge of菌种 (junzhong; strains) cultivation.

    Chen Baolan understands that learning is for better work. Therefore, she worked hard in her job. Even trivial tasks such as lighting the stove, washing bottles, picking grass, and sweeping the floor, she rushed to do, not afraid of being tired or getting dirty. This spring, Chen Baolan worked with everyone during the day and was on duty in the菌种 (junzhong; strains) cultivation room at night. Chen Baolan often stayed up all night by the stove, getting her hands black and her face and nostrils full of black ash. The temperature in the菌种 (junzhong; strains) cultivation room was often as high as 40 degrees Celsius, hot and dry. Most people felt stuffy after being there for a few minutes, but Chen Baolan often worked the night shift for more than ten days in a row so that other comrades could sleep well.

    Last year, Chen Baolan and her comrades not only quickly cultivated the first generation of shiitake mushrooms and straw mushrooms in the Damaoshan area using scientific methods, but also extracted precious chemical raw materials—acetone and butanol—from wild lycoris radiata.

    In the three years since she came to the mountains, she has gradually grown from an ordinary junior high school student into a red technician. In June of this year, the Jiangxi Provincial Academy of Sciences also hired her as a special researcher.

    红色技术员陈葆兰
    被评为全国“三八”红旗手和江西省巧姐妹的陈葆兰，下放到大茅山以前，一直在学校里读书。来大茅山之初，她连一桶水也抬不起。但是，经过一段时间的劳动锻炼，她越来越坚强了，成了一个光荣的共青团员和技术员。
    去年，陈葆兰被调到食用菌种厂学习培养菌种。她原来对生物、化学、细菌、接种……一点也不摸门。许多复杂的仪器、药品更是不懂。但是，她立志努力学习，迅速掌握技术。她自己买了一些有关培菌的书籍，看不懂就向老同志们请教。别人休息了，她还蹲在试验室里琢磨观察，刻苦钻研。就这样，她逐渐地学会了一些初步的培菌知识。
    陈葆兰懂得：学习是为了更好工作。因此，她在工作中埋头苦干。即便是生炉子、洗瓶子、挑草、扫地这些琐碎的劳动，她也抢着去干，不怕累不嫌脏。今年春天，陈葆兰白天和大家一道工作，夜里还在培菌室值班。陈葆兰经常通宵守在炉边，弄得双手乌黑，脸上和鼻孔里都是黑灰。培菌室的温度经常高到摄氏四十度，又热又干燥，一般人呆上几分钟就感到发闷，而陈葆兰为了让其他同志睡好觉，她往往一连十几天值夜班。
    去年，陈葆兰和同志们一道，不仅用科学方法迅速地在大茅山区栽培了第一代香菇和草菇，而且还从野生石蒜里制取出了珍贵的化工原料——丙酮和丁醇。
    上山三年，她从一个普通初中学生逐步地锻炼成了红色技术员。今年6月，江西省科学院还聘请她为特约研究员。
