　　Jiaohe Commercial Departments Vigorously Support Winter Sideline Production
　　(This newspaper dispatch) Jilin Province, Jiaohe County's commercial departments are promoting rural winter sideline production by participating in planning, organizing production, and correctly implementing procurement policies.
　　The Jiaohe County commercial departments recently held a sideline production meeting with the participation of supply and marketing cooperative party branch secretaries, supply and marketing cooperative directors, and purchasing station managers. They made comprehensive arrangements on how to correctly implement procurement policies and organize winter sideline production. The county has organized more than 280 employees to go deep into communes, management districts, and production teams. In conjunction with procurement, they are helping communes and teams comprehensively arrange various winter productions. The Happiness Road Commune Supply and Marketing Cooperative organized more than 30 employees to participate in winter sideline production planning meetings held by communes, management districts, and production teams, comprehensively promoted the Party's policies on winter sideline production and procurement to commune cadres and members, introduced sideline product varieties, helped divide business scopes, determined income distribution methods, helped formulate sideline production plans, and promoted the active development of winter sideline production by various management districts and production teams in the entire commune. Commercial departments at all levels, based on national and market needs, have universally signed production and sales delivery contracts with various production teams. The Tiangang Commune Supply and Marketing Cooperative signed production and sales contracts with thirty-three production teams in the Yongfeng, Qidaohe, Hongxing, and Dahuopenggou management districts for thirty-two large and small varieties such as papermaking grass, turnip strips, charcoal, frame strips, and baskets, amounting to more than 260,000 yuan. In the process of organizing production, commercial departments throughout the county paid attention to publicizing the view of comprehensively fulfilling national plans to management district and production team cadres and members. The Laoyeling and Xiaogujia production teams in the Beian Management District of the Happiness Road Commune are key papermaking grass production areas. After the cadre stationed in the team from the supply and marketing cooperative explained to the team leader and members that papermaking grass is a raw material urgently needed by industry, the two teams decided to cut papermaking grass first. Now, more than 40,000 jin have been cut.
　　Commercial departments at all levels actively help various communes solve difficulties in production and vigorously support winter sideline production through purchasing and sales business activities. For example, many production teams need hunting medicine, and commercial departments organize community-run industries to produce it, ensuring the needs are met. Commercial departments in various places vigorously improve supply methods, delivering production and living materials for winter sideline production to the front line in a timely manner through canteen markets and on-site services. According to statistics, from October to now, the county has supplied more than 12,000 sickles, more than 2,000 axes, 1,900 rounds of hunting rifle bullets, 3,500 jin of gunpowder, 1,530 jin of gunshot, and 49,471 pairs of cotton-soled shoes, timely meeting the needs of sideline production and greatly encouraging the production enthusiasm of commune members.
　　These activities of the commercial departments have not only promoted winter sideline production but also expanded purchasing business. At present, the county has purchased 1,900 jin of yuan mushrooms, 4,113 dan of papermaking grass, 626 dan of reeds, 1,251 grass bags, 247 tons of turnip strips, and 2,600 pairs of earth baskets. In addition to fur and medicinal materials, a total of more than 100 kinds of local and special products have been purchased, with a total value of more than 1 million yuan.

    宣传政策　组织生产　签订产销合同　加强收购供应
    蛟河商业部门大力支持冬季副业生产
    本报讯　吉林省蛟河县商业部门通过参与规划、组织生产，正确贯彻收购政策，促进农村冬季副业生产。
    蛟河县商业部门最近召开有供销部党支部书记、供销部主任、采购站经理等参加的副业生产会议，对如何正确贯彻收购政策、组织好冬季副业生产做了全面部署。全县共组织了二百八十多名职工深入公社、管理区、生产队，结合收购，帮助社、队全面安排冬季各项生产。幸福之路公社供销部组织三十多名职工参加公社、管理区、生产队召开的冬季副业生产规划会议，向公社干部和社员全面宣传了党关于冬季副业生产和收购的政策，介绍副业产品品种，帮助划分经营范围，确定收益分配办法，帮助制定了副业生产规划，推动全公社各管理区、生产队积极开展了冬季副业生产。各级商业部门根据国家和市场需要，同各生产队普遍签订了产销交售合同。天岗公社供销部同永丰、七道河、红星、大伙朋沟等四个管理区的三十三个生产队签订了造纸草、苕条、木炭、架条、筐等三十二个大小品种的产销合同，金额达二十六万多元。全县商业部门在组织生产过程中，注意向管理区、生产队干部和社员宣传全面完成国家计划的观点。幸福之路公社北安管理区老爷岭和小姑家两个生产队是造纸草重点产区。供销部驻队干部向队长和社员说明造纸草是工业急需的原料以后，这两个队确定先割造纸草。现在，已经割了四万多斤。
    各级商业部门通过购销业务活动，积极帮助各公社解决生产中的困难，大力支援冬季副业生产。如不少生产队需要狩猎用药，商业部门就组织社办工业生产，保证了需要。各地商业部门大力改进供应方法，通过食堂集市和服务到现场，把冬季副业生产的生产资料和生活资料及时送到第一线。据统计，全县从10月到现在，已经供应镰刀一万二千多把，斧子二千多把，猎枪子弹一千九百发，火药三千五百斤，枪砂子一千五百三十斤，棉胶鞋四万九千四百七十一双，及时满足了副业生产的需要，大大鼓舞了社员的生产积极性。
    商业部门的这些活动，既促进了冬季副业生产，又扩大了收购业务。现在，全县已经收购元蘑一千九百斤，造纸草四千一百一十三担，苇子六百二十六担，草袋子一千二百五十一条，苕条二百四十七吨，土篮子二千六百付。加上皮张、药材等，收购的土副特产品共一百多种，总值达一百多万元。
