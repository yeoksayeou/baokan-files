    A Vigorous Leader
    -- On the Exemplary Deeds of Shang Zijie, Party Secretary of Yiyang Commune
    By our correspondent Wang Jianlin

    Shang Zijie, the first secretary of the Yiyang People's Commune Party Committee in Feicheng County, Shandong Province, is already in his fifties. He escaped famine, begged for food, and toiled as a laborer in his youth. After liberation, he served as the secretary of the district party committee and the secretary of the commune party committee. Over the years, he has always been full of revolutionary vigor. The commune members say he is younger than the young people.

    Adhering to the Direction of Vigorously Developing Grain Production

    Ever since Shang Zijie became the secretary of the district party committee in 1956, he has been determined to solve the grain problem and enable the masses to live a prosperous life. After the establishment of the commune, he felt an even greater responsibility to manage this household well and believed that solving the grain problem was the first priority. To solve the grain problem, he walked through every mountain gully and traversed ninety-two mountain peaks, large and small, to investigate and analyze the local climate, soil, and growth characteristics of various crops. Old farmers told him that the local area had many mountains but little land, a severe shortage of water, and was prone to drought. In the past, the millet and corn planted on the mountains were often withered by drought. Only sweet potatoes could guarantee a harvest every year. Shang Zijie attached great importance to this advice and wanted to plant this highly adaptable, disaster-resistant, and high-yielding crop on a large scale throughout the district. He transported some Victory No. 100 sweet potato seedlings from other places, which were high-yielding and had short vines, but no one wanted to plant them. Some people also did not understand the idea of close planting with 3,000 plants per mu. To gain experience and educate the masses, Shang Zijie insisted on conducting experiments first. He and others conducted comparative experiments under the same conditions. As a result, Shang Zijie's two mu of sweet potatoes yielded 5,800 jin per mu, while others only yielded 3,200 jin per mu. Shang Zijie used this as an example to convene symposiums with cadres and old farmers to unify their thinking and expand the sweet potato planting area.

    Shang Zijie lacked experience in planting sweet potatoes on a large scale. The only way was to seek advice from the masses. He made many close friends among the old farmers and learned from them the experience of planting sweet potatoes. He first experimented with what he learned in his own experimental fields, and then promoted it after gaining experience. In practice, he felt that relying solely on the original experience of the old farmers was not enough. Together with agricultural technicians, he gathered the scattered experiences of the old farmers and, with reference to the experience gained from visiting other places, he conducted comprehensive analysis and research. He derived a complete set of scientific management techniques and experience, from sweet potato seedling cultivation, furrowing, planting, to harvesting and storage. He widely disseminated these techniques and experience through on-site meetings and other means, and persisted in doing so. Last year and this year, although Yiyang Commune suffered from severe drought, sweet potatoes and other crops still achieved continuous bumper harvests.

    Taking the Lead Everywhere and Working Hard

    In his actual work, Shang Zijie has always been down-to-earth and hardworking. He said, "To change the face of poverty, how can we not put in more effort?". In the winter of 1959, Shang Zijie led more than 5,000 people from the commune to manage Mother Pig Mountain. He moved his bedding to the mountain. One day, it was snowing heavily and the temperature plummeted. Some cadres advocated postponing the mountain management work. Shang Zijie didn't say anything. Early in the morning, he ran to the mountain alone and dug several fish-scale pits. After trying it, he didn't feel too cold. He thought, "If an old man like me can handle it, the masses can also handle it." So he led everyone to work. Within half a month, eleven mountains, large and small, were managed. Shang Zijie installed a telephone on the mountain, managing the mountains while directing the production of each team. One person persisted, and ten thousand people persisted. Each production team did not stop winter production in the freezing cold. Commune members said that Secretary Shang's hands would itch if he didn't work. He worked wherever he went. This summer, he passed by Liujia Tai and encountered commune members planting sweet potatoes while fighting the drought. That day, the sky was overcast and it looked like it was going to rain. Captain Liu Gongzuo wanted to wait until after the rain to work. However, Shang Zijie believed that this was a good opportunity to plant sweet potatoes and should not be missed. He personally led people to the fields. That day, the entire team planted more than 30 mu in one go, saving labor and water, and the sweet potato survival rate was high. Other production teams, knowing that Shang Zijie was leading the commune members to plant sweet potatoes, also persisted in working in the rain, and the progress of sweet potato planting was much faster than usual.

    Shang Zijie is very enthusiastic about participating in labor. Throughout the year, except for meetings, he is rarely found in the office. When he goes to the production teams to guide and inspect production, he does not just stand aside and point fingers. Instead, he works with the cadres and commune members, and solves problems on the spot. Under his influence, cadres at all levels in the commune have also developed the habit of participating in labor. During the busy farming season, most offices are closed. However, he often tells the cadres, "When cadres participate in labor, they should not only see the mud under the hoe, but also see more, ask more, think more, and discuss with the masses to play the role of participating in production and guiding production." When carrying out pig raising activities last winter, Shang Zijie lived in the Wang Jin production team's breeding farm, working with Dong Shuya, an old man with many years of pig raising experience, to mix feed, feed pigs, breed pigs, and repair pigsties. When a sow was about to give birth, he stayed up all night to watch over it. While working, he learned from Old Man Dong how to cut the umbilical cord of piglets and keep them warm, and immediately promoted these methods throughout the commune.

    Planning Each Step and Working Thoroughly and Meticulously

    This year, before the late autumn crops were harvested, large and small piles of manure were scattered on the fields and field edges of Yiyang Commune. Each production team transported fertilizer to the fields in advance, preparing to spread the base fertilizer as soon as the stubble was cleared, and planting wheat while plowing the land. This was a plan that Shang Zijie had prepared more than a month in advance, based on the lessons learned in the previous two years. This year, there are many autumn farming tasks and a shortage of labor. If arrangements are not made early, the farming tasks will be crowded together, and planting will be delayed. Shang Zijie foresaw this and mobilized the commune members to transport fertilizer to the fields in advance. The commune members said:
    "Our Secretary Shang can see several steps ahead with one glance. He has already planned things that others can't think of." This year, when planting wheat, the superiors required deep plowing. Everyone was worried that there were not enough tools, but Shang Zijie had already instructed the commune's farm tool factory to manufacture a batch of mixed plows. After trial use, they not only met the requirements for deep plowing, but also saved animal power. Before the autumn plowing began, the commune held a meeting of small team cadres and plowmen in the first small team of Yiyang Brigade, allowing everyone to try plowing. Everyone unanimously expressed satisfaction and had confidence in deep plowing.

    The reason why Shang Zijie is able to take the initiative step by step is because he works thoroughly and meticulously, and understands the production situation. When he goes to the production teams to inspect production, he does not only listen to the cadres' reports. Instead, he first goes to the canteen, the home for the elderly, the kindergarten, the breeding farm, and other places to talk to people, look at the fields, and then talk to the cadres. Shang Zijie's inspection of production is not only to look at the near and conspicuous places, but also to look at the far and less frequented places. The commune covers an area of fifty li, with one hundred and eight villages, and his footprints are everywhere. When inspecting the "Ten Edges Wasteland" this June, he led the commune cadres to walk through every mountain. Thanks to this inspection, the entire commune opened up more than 10,000 mu of wasteland.

        "He is truly a source of good living"
    Shang Zijie keeps every grain of food in mind. During the harvest season, he walks on the road and his pockets are always filled with ears of grain. This autumn, when harvesting sweet potatoes, he re-examined a plot of land in Nanyang Brigade and found that they were not dug cleanly. He convened an on-site meeting and demanded that everyone not drop a single leaf stalk or a single sweet potato block. He often says, "I feel heartache when I see the grain that commune members have exchanged for sweat being scattered." Last autumn, when sweet potatoes were harvested in abundance, some people ate sweet potatoes like bananas, peeling off the skin and throwing away the heads, leaving them all over the table and ground. When Shang Zijie ate sweet potatoes in the canteen of the first small team of Yiyang Brigade, he didn't drop or waste a bit. People around him, seeing this, quietly picked up the peeled sweet potato skins. This incident spread throughout the commune, and everyone paid attention to thrift. A female commune member said to everyone, "Secretary Shang is truly a source of good living. If everyone is like him, we are guaranteed to live a better life."

    Shang Zijie cares for the lives of the masses in every possible way. One day, he was walking on the road and heard two children say, "There is sand in today's breakfast, it's really hard to eat." He stopped the two children and asked for details, and then went to the first canteen of Yiyang Brigade to find out the reason why there was sand in the rice. He said to the team cadres and canteen cadres, "Come, let's do it ourselves and see!" So, he carefully washed, rinsed, cut, and mixed the dough, and steamed a pot of steaming vegetable buns. Everyone tasted them, and they were both delicious and sand-free. Once, Shang Zijie went to the canteen of the eleventh small team of Shiwu Brigade and found that there was no porridge to drink at night. He said, "If you don't drink porridge, how can the female commune members with children have milk to breastfeed their children?" The next day, the commune members of this canteen drank porridge. Because Shang Zijie cared for the masses in every possible way, the commune members more actively engaged in production, striving to harvest more grain next year.

    朝气蓬勃的带头人
    ——记仪阳公社党委书记尚子捷的模范事迹
    本报记者　王建林
    山东省肥城县仪阳人民公社党委第一书记尚子捷，已经是五十多岁的人了。他从小逃过荒，要过饭，扛过活。解放后，他担任区委书记和公社党委书记，多年来，在他的身上一直充满着一股蓬勃的革命朝气，社员说他比年轻的人还年轻。
    坚持大办粮食的方向
    尚子捷从1956年当区委书记时起，就下决心要解决粮食问题，让群众过富裕生活。公社化后，他更感到自己的责任重大，要当好这个家，非首先解决粮食问题不可。为了解决粮食问题，他走遍了每一条山沟，踏遍了大小九十二座山头，考察分析了当地的气候、土壤以及各种农作物的生长特性。老农告诉他，当地山多地薄，水源奇缺，十年九旱，过去山上种植的谷子、玉米等多被旱死，只有地瓜，年年能够保住收成。尚子捷很重视这个意见，想在全区大量种植这种适应性大、抗灾力强而又能够高产的作物。从外地运来了一部分胜利百号地瓜秧苗，产量高，秧子短，可是谁都不愿种。密植每亩三千株，有些人也不通。为了取得经验，教育群众，尚子捷坚持先作试验。他跟别人在同样的条件下，进行对比试验的结果，尚子捷种的二亩地瓜亩产五千八百斤，别的只亩产三千二百斤。尚子捷就拿这做样子，召开干部和老农座谈会，统一了思想，扩大了地瓜种植面积。
    对于大面积栽种地瓜，尚子捷十分缺乏经验，办法只有一条，向群众求谋问计。他在老农中结交了许多知心朋友，向他们学习栽种地瓜的经验。他学到的东西，首先在自己的试验田里作试验，取得经验后再推广。在实践中，他觉得单靠老农原有的经验还不够，便同农业技术员一起，将老农一些点滴的分散的经验集中起来，并参照到外地参观得来的经验，加以综合分析研究，得出了从地瓜育苗、扶沟、栽种，一直到收刨、储藏等一整套科学管理技术和经验，并通过现场会等方式广为传播，坚持下去。去年和今年，仪阳公社虽都遭到严重干旱，但地瓜和其他作物仍连续获得了丰收。
    处处带头　埋头苦干
    在实际工作中，尚子捷一贯脚踏实地苦干实干。他说：“要改变贫穷面貌，不多出点力还行？”。1959年冬，尚子捷带领公社五千多人治理母猪山，他把铺盖搬到了山上。有天，雪花飘飘，气温骤降，有些干部主张推迟治山时间。尚子捷没说话，大清早一个人跑到山上，挖了几个鱼鳞坑，试了试，觉得并不怎么冷。他想：我这老头子能撑得住，群众也就能撑得住，便率领大家干起来。半个月内，治理了大小十一座山。尚子捷在山上安了电话，一面治山，一面指挥各队的生产。一人坚持，万人坚持，各生产队在天寒地冻的情况下，冬季生产也未停工。社员说，尚书记不干活就手痒痒，他走到哪里就干到哪里。今年夏季，他从刘家台路过，正碰上社员抗旱栽地瓜。这天阴云密布，眼看就要下雨了，队长刘公左想雨后再干。尚子捷却认为这正是栽地瓜的好机会，不能错过。便亲自带人下地。这天，全小队一气栽了三十多亩，省工省水，地瓜成活率高。其他生产队知道尚子捷带领社员栽地瓜，也都冒雨坚持，栽地瓜进度比平常加快了许多。
    尚子捷参加劳动的积极性很高，一年到头，除开会外，在办公室里很少能找到他。他到生产队指导、检查生产，不是在一旁指手划脚，而是同干部社员一起劳动，发现问题就地解决。在他影响下，公社各级干部也都养成了参加劳动的风气，每到农忙季节，办公室多数闭门锁户。但是，他又常对干部说：“干部参加劳动，不应光看到锄头底下的一块泥，而要多看，多问，多想，多跟群众研究商量，才能起到参加生产、指导生产的作用。”去冬开展养猪活动时，尚子捷就住到王晋生产队饲养场里，跟有多年养猪经验的董淑雅老汉一起，给猪拌料、喂食、配种、修猪圈。母猪临产了，他整夜守着。他一边干，一边跟董老汉学会了如何给猪仔剪脐带、取暖等办法，并立即在全公社推广。
    走这步看那步　工作深入细致
    今年晚秋作物还没收完，仪阳公社的地头和地边上，就散布着大大小小的粪堆。各生产队提前把肥运到地里，准备一腾出茬来，就铺上底肥，边耕地边种小麦。这是尚子捷根据前两年的教训，提前一个多月打好的谱。今年三秋农活多，劳力紧，若不早作安排，农活挤在一块，就会误了播种。尚子捷预见到了这一点，就发动社员提前把肥料运到了地里。社员说：
    “俺尚书记能一眼看透好几步棋，别人寻思不到的事，他早就盘算好了。”今年种麦，上级要求深耕，大家正愁着工具不够，尚子捷却已经指示公社农具厂，制造了一批混合犁，经过试用，不但达到深耕要求，还能节省畜力。秋耕开始前，公社就在仪阳大队一小队，召开了小队干部和扶犁手会议，让每个人都试耕了一下，大家一致表示满意，对深耕有了信心。
    尚子捷所以能够步步主动，是由于他工作深入细致，对生产摸底。他到各生产队检查生产时，不只听干部的汇报，而是先到食堂、敬老院、幼儿园、饲养场等地方转转，同人们谈谈，到地里看看，然后再同干部交谈。尚子捷检查生产，还不仅看近的、显眼的地方，而且要看远的、人们不常到的地方。公社方圆五十里，一百零八个村，到处都有他的足迹。今年6月检查“十边荒”时，他带领公社干部走遍每个山头。经这次检查促进，全公社多开荒地一万多亩。
        “真是过日子的来头”
    尚子捷对每一颗粮食，都放在眼里。在收获季节，他在路上走一趟，口袋里总是塞满粮穗。今秋收刨地瓜，他在南阳大队的一块地里复查了一下，发现刨得不净，便召开现场会，要求大家不掉一片叶梗，一个瓜块。他常说：“我看到社员用汗水换来的粮食抛撒了，就觉得心痛。”去秋地瓜丰收，有些人吃地瓜跟吃香蕉一样，剥皮去头，丢得满桌满地。尚子捷在仪阳大队一小队食堂吃地瓜时，却一点不丢不损。周围的人看见后，都悄悄将剥掉的地瓜皮拾了起来。这件事传遍全公社，每个人都注意了节约。一个女社员到处对人说：“尚书记真是过日子的来头，大伙都跟他一样，保准日子能过得更好。”
    尚子捷对群众的生活关怀备至。有天，他在路上走，听到两个小孩子说：“今天早饭有沙子，真难吃。”他将两个孩子叫住，问了一下详细情况，随即又到仪阳大队第一食堂，弄清了饭内有沙子的原因。他对队干部和食堂干部说：“来，咱们亲手做做看！”于是，他细心地洗、淘、切、和面，蒸出了一锅热气腾腾的菜窝窝，大家尝了尝，又好吃，又没沙子。一次，尚子捷到石坞大队十一小队食堂，发现晚上没有稀饭喝，他说：“不喝稀饭，有孩子的女社员哪有奶水奶孩子？”第二天，这个食堂的社员就喝上了稀饭。由于尚子捷无微不至地关心群众，社员更加积极地投入生产，力争明年收打更多的粮食。
