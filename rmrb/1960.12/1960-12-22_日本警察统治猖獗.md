Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th. The Japanese people are living under a dark police rule. According to Nobuo Kashimura, Director-General of the Japanese National Police Agency, yesterday, in addition to approximately 130,000 police officers, the police authorities have also established more than 10,000 "assistants" (spies) across the country to provide the police with information about left-wing groups and individuals.

Kashimura also admitted that the Japanese police have deployed approximately 200 wiretaps nationwide and that each prefectural police headquarters has two "periscopes."

This top official of the Japanese police authorities also said that the Japanese police authorities regularly investigate the situations of ten organizations, including the Japanese Communist Party, and are prepared to invoke the fascist law, the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act," at any time to carry out persecution.

Kashimura was forced to reveal this information on the morning of the 19th when answering questions from Socialist Party member Sanji Yajima at a meeting of the House of Councillors Budget Committee.

Yajima cited secret documents of the Shimane Prefectural Police Headquarters published by the Japanese Communist Party and questioned Kashimura about the police situation. He also revealed that the Japanese police create "personal investigation forms" for the Communist Party and progressive organizations, compile blacklists, and carry out despicable activities such as stalking and taking photos of residences. He pointed out that these activities are acts of trampling on human rights.

Yajima said that the Shimane Prefectural Police authorities alone spent 1.94 billion yen on police expenses in 1960. Secret documents show that gifts given by the police to superiors are allocated from the police's "investigation expenses," and even the police's food and drink expenses are randomly allocated from taxes.

    日本警察统治猖獗
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：日本人民生活在黑暗的警察统治中。据日本警察厅长官柏村信雄昨天透露，日本除了约有十三万警察外，警察当局还在全国设有一万多名“协助者”（特务），向警察提供有关左翼团体和人士的情报。
    柏村还承认，日本警察在全国布置了大约二百个偷听器，并且在每一个县的警察本部里都设有两个“潜望镜”。
    这个日本警察当局的最高官员还说：日本警察当局经常调查日本共产党等十个组织的情况，准备随时引用法西斯法律“防止破坏活动法”，进行迫害。
    柏村是在19日上午举行的参议院决算委员会会议上答复社会党议员矢嶋三义的质询时被迫透露这些情况的。
    矢嶋援引日本共产党公布的岛根县警察本部秘密文件，向柏村质询了警察的情况。他还揭露，日本警察对共产党和进步组织制作“个人调查表”，并编制黑名单，进行盯梢和拍摄住宅照片等卑鄙活动。他指出：这些活动是蹂躏人权的暴行。
    矢嶋说，仅仅岛根县警察当局在1960年的警察费就达十九亿四千万日元。秘密文件表明，警察送给上级的礼物，都由警察的“搜查费”中拨出，甚至警察吃喝费用也由税款中乱拨。
