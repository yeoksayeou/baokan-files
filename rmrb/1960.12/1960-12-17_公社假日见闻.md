Commune Holiday Sights
By Our Correspondent Wei Changwang

One day in early winter, I visited the Songjiatang Brigade of the Liangshitang People's Commune in Shaodong County, Hunan Province. The commune members were rushing to plant wheat and rapeseed, and only a small portion of the sowing task remained, which would soon be completed. After their labor, the commune members always liked to talk about their holiday activities. It turned out that this brigade had generally implemented a holiday system: male commune members get two days off per month, and female commune members get four days off per month. The holiday dates are determined by the production team and work group in consultation with the commune members based on the busy or slack periods of production, which makes it more convenient for the commune members.

The following are fragments of commune holiday observations.

Peng Ersao's Chit-Chat
From the entrance of the Advanced Production Team No. 1 canteen, separated by only one room, was the home of commune member Peng Ersao. It was already noon, and some commune members had already started eating lunch, but she was still sitting at a small table by the door, intently making shoes for her eldest daughter, Chun'e. Peng Ersao is a capable female commune member. Her family of seven, including her husband Liu Jun, who works as an accountant in the brigade's comprehensive factory and is often away from home, rely on her to do all the laundry, shoemaking, and mending. Everyone in the family, young and old, is dressed neatly and cleanly. In addition to managing the household, she is also very active in labor, earning twenty-six or seven work points each month.

While making shoes, Peng Ersao chatted with Zeng Erniang, her neighbor, about everything from making shoes to holidays. Zeng Erniang praised Peng Ersao for being capable. Peng Ersao repeatedly said that it was thanks to the good policies of the Party and Chairman Mao's genuine concern for the commune members. There was actually a story behind it:

Last year, also around this time, she and all the women in her work group participated in the construction of a reservoir, but her second son, Xin Geng, urgently needed a pair of cotton shoes. Although the cadres on the construction site had repeatedly said that those with special difficulties at home could ask for leave, she always felt that building the reservoir was a major event related to the commune and the team. How could she ask for leave when others were working so hard? She delayed it for more than twenty days. It wasn't until one day of rest on the construction site that she hurriedly made a pair of cotton shoes for her son to wear.

Talking about this matter, she happily said to Zeng Erniang, "Erniang, look how thoughtful the higher-ups are for us women! In the past, considering that we women have special difficulties, they stipulated that we could ask for a few days off each month. Now, it's as if they saw that we were embarrassed to ask for leave ourselves, so they simply stipulated that we get four days off each month. Seriously, even our own parents weren't this good to their daughters!" Peng Ersao said that she planned to use her holidays this winter to make all the shoes that her family members would need to wear next year, mend their clothes, and then start work in the spring, wholeheartedly focusing on production.

Zeng Erniang was reminded by her words, stood up, and said, "Yes! I should also go back and tidy up my house so I can go to work neatly tomorrow!"

Wu Wusao's Birthday

This day happened to be the fortieth birthday of Wu Wusao, a commune member of the Shuangtang Production Team No. 3 work group. Early in the morning, she ate breakfast, changed her clothes, and carried her six-month-old child to pick up her sixty-five-year-old mother, her younger brother and his wife, and her nephew from nearby to come home to celebrate her birthday together.

Lunch was made at home, with several dishes on the table. In addition to her own family of five, she also invited the work group leader and several other guests. Everyone ate and talked with laughter. At this moment, the old lady Qiao Erniang left her seat, took out a thirteen-foot-long piece of blue gabardine from a handkerchief, and placed it in her daughter's hands with deep meaning, saying, "Banbao (Wu Wusao's childhood name): This is what your mother earned this year from sideline occupations and bought with her own hands. The People's Commune is really good. Not only does my family not have to worry about food and clothing, but even an old woman like me can earn money to buy things for you for your birthday. Remember my words: Be sure to run the canteen well so that our lives become even sweeter."

People Who Can't Put Down Production

On holidays, people can indulge in playing and taking care of their own household chores. However, on every holiday, there are some people who don't want to rest that day in order not to miss the opportunity for production. On the day that the "July 1st" Production Team had a holiday, there were five commune members on the ridges of the first work group engaged in a battle to rush plow winter paddy fields.

It turned out that the day before the holiday, there was a heavy rain that soaked the fifty-odd mu of dry, hard, yellowish clay fields. At dinner, when the work group leader announced in the canteen that there would be a holiday tomorrow, poor peasant commune member Li Dayun, who was in charge of plowing, automatically asked Yao Zaisheng, Yao Rongting, and two other members of the plowing group, "Folks! The team is having a holiday tomorrow, but our plowing group won't rest. Let's try to plow it over while the fields are still wet, so that we won't have to dig with hoes when planting crops in the future. What do you think?" Yao Zaisheng and the others responded, "That's fine. Anyway, we're working for ourselves. It doesn't matter which day we rest. Why do we have to rest tomorrow?" Early that morning, Li Dayun and the others got up to check their tools. After eating breakfast, they each harnessed their plows and drove their oxen to work. As soon as they entered the fields, the five of them started a competition, working even harder.

That day, the five of them plowed a total of 8.2 mu of winter paddy fields, exceeding the daily labor quota of 7.5 mu.

The Party Branch Secretary's "Holiday"

On the day of the holiday, Zou Xinsheng, the Party Branch Secretary of the Advanced Production Team, arrived at the Second Canteen early in the morning. As soon as he entered the door, cook Tang Juxiang and others asked him warmly, "Secretary Zou, you're up so early today. Where are you going?" The Party Branch Secretary said happily, "I'm here to help you cook!"

"Help us cook? Aren't we all here? We don't need your help!" Xu Yuanhua said, pointing to herself and Tang Juxiang and Jiang Meiying, who were busy.

"You work hard from morning till night every day. When others have a holiday, you still have to cook. It's really hard. Today is a holiday, and I have nothing to do, so I came to help you." With that, he started to help measure rice and steam rice. Then, he picked up water buckets and went to the pond to fetch water. Seeing that the Party Branch Secretary was so earnest, Xu Yuanhua happily said to Tang Juxiang, "Today is a holiday, we must make the food good so that everyone can eat to their satisfaction and have fun." Everyone nodded happily.

Before stir-frying, Zou Xinsheng had already carried the water and put down the pole, and then asked everyone, "Today is a holiday, what good dishes are you going to make for everyone?" Xu Yuanhua pointed with her hand and said, "We prepared shredded cabbage last night."

"Anything else?"

"Add dried sword beans stir-fried with chili peppers."

"I agree with both." The Party Branch Secretary nodded and said, "But you have to stir-fry it a little better. When stir-frying the cabbage, the fire should be hot, and you should also add some chili peppers so that everyone feels it has some flavor when they eat it." With that, he started to light the fire and help them stir-fry the dishes.

At half past eight, the canteen opened for meals. On each table was a large bowl of shredded cabbage and a bowl of chili-fried dried sword beans. An old commune member said to a young man at the next table while eating, "Why does today's shredded cabbage taste especially good compared to usual?" The young man leaned close to his ear and whispered, "Today's shredded cabbage was personally supervised by our Secretary Zou." The old man smiled with satisfaction.

At this moment, someone recited a clapper rhyme at the table: "The secretary goes to the kitchen, the food changes greatly; although it is ordinary dishes, the taste is especially fragrant." Everyone said, "Well said! Well said!"

On this holiday, Jiang Yuncheng, the Party Branch Secretary of the Shuangtang Production Team, also visited poor peasant commune members' homes one by one. He first went to commune member Yao Shuquan's home. He knew that Yao Shuquan was injured on duty in January this year and is still recuperating. At this time, Yao Shuquan wanted to buy some wine to help promote blood circulation, but he didn't have enough money for a while and hadn't bought it yet. Jiang Yuncheng knew his request and immediately lent him more than eight jiao. He also asked if he had any other difficulties. Yao Shuquan said very moved, "I don't have any requests. After I was injured, the Party and the government cared about me so much, invited doctors to treat me, and the brigade also lent me more than thirty yuan. What other difficulties do I have? I can only wait until I recover from my injury and work harder to repay the kindness of the Party and the commune."

The commune members' holiday activities are varied, some handle household chores at home, some go out to visit relatives..., but the effects are all the same: people work for ten days or so, take a rest, handle their own personal affairs, and the next day they have even more energy for production.

    公社假日见闻
    本报记者　魏昌旺
    初冬的一天，我访问了湖南邵东县两市塘人民公社宋家塘大队，社员们正在抢种小麦和油菜，播种任务只剩下了一个尾巴，很快就完成了。社员们在劳动之余，总喜欢谈起假日的活动。原来，这个大队普遍实行了放假的制度：男社员每人每月放假两天；女社员每人每月放假四天。放假日期是由生产队、作业组根据生产忙闲和社员商量确定的，这就使社员们更方便了。
    下面记载的，是公社假日见闻的片断。
    彭二嫂的家常话
    从前进生产队第一食堂出来，只隔一间房子，就到了社员彭二嫂的家。这时，已是中午时分，有的社员已经开始吃中饭了，只有她还坐在大门边的一只小桌旁，聚精会神地为她的大女儿春娥做着鞋子。彭二嫂是个能干的女社员，她一家大小七口人，丈夫刘军在大队综合工厂当会计，经常不回家。一家人洗衣、做鞋、缝缝补补，靠她一个人做。家里不论大人小孩，都是穿得整整齐齐、干干净净。除了管理家务以外，她劳动也很积极，每月都要做二十六、七个工。
    彭二嫂一边做鞋子，一边和隔壁的曾二娘谈家常，从做鞋子谈到放假。曾二娘夸彭二嫂能干。彭二嫂只口口声声说是党的政策好，毛主席对社员关心的真周到。原来有这么一段故事：
    去年，也是这个时候，她和全作业组的妇女都参加了修水库，但是她的第二个儿子新庚这时急需一双棉鞋。虽然工地上的干部也再三说过，家里有特殊困难的可以请假，但她始终觉得修水库是关系到一社、一队的大事，别人积极劳动，自己怎好请假呢，一拖就拖了二十多天。直到有一天工地休息日，她才匆匆忙忙地赶做成一双棉鞋，给儿子穿了。
    谈到这件事，她高兴地对曾二娘说：“二娘，你看上级为我们妇女安排得多么周到啊！以前，考虑到我们妇女有特殊困难，规定每月可以请几天假。现在，好像看见我们自己不好开口请假，就干脆规定每月放四天假。认真说起来，自己的父母对待自己的女儿也没有这么好！”彭二嫂说，她打算利用今年冬季的假日，把全家几个人明年要穿的鞋子都做好，衣服补起，明年一开春就出工，落心落意的搞生产。
    曾二娘被她一句话提醒了，站起来说：“是呀！我也该回去把家里收拾一下，明天好利利落落出工呀！”
    吴五嫂的生日
    这一天，恰巧是双塘生产队第三作业组社员吴五嫂四十周岁的生日。清早她吃了饭，换了衣服，抱上自己半岁的小孩，到附近去接已经六十五岁的老娘和娘家的弟弟、弟媳及侄儿等一同到家来过生日。
    午饭是在家里做的，桌上摆几样菜。除了她自家大小五人外，还请了作业组长等几个客人。大家笑哈哈地吃着、谈着。就在这时老太太乔二娘离开坐位，从一块手巾内取出一丈三尺蓝士林布，双手放在女儿的手里，意味深长地说：“班保（吴五嫂的乳名）：这是你娘今年搞副业亲手赚来的钱买的。人民公社真好，我家不但不愁吃不愁穿，连我这个老婆婆也能靠自己的劳动赚钱买东西给你贺生日了。要记住娘的话：一定要把食堂办好，使我们的日子过得更甜。”
    丢不下生产的人
    在放假的日子，人们虽然可以尽情地去玩，去搞自己的小家务。但是，在每个假日里都有一些为了不失生产时机，不愿在当天休息的人。“七一”生产队放假的那一天，第一作业组田坎上，就有五个社员正在进行着一场抢犁冬板田的战斗。
    原来，在放假的前一天，这里下了一场大雨，把这五十多亩干得又坚又硬的黄夹泥田浸透了。吃晚饭时，当作业组长在食堂里宣布明天放假以后，负责犁田的贫农社员李达云就自动找犁田小组的姚再生、姚荣庭等四人说：“伙计！明天组里放假，我们犁田组不休息，争取趁田里水没有干时就把它犁转来，以免将来种作物时又要用锄头去挖，你们看怎样？”姚再生等都响应说：“要得。反正自己给自己做活，哪天休息不一样，为什么明天就非休息不可呢！”这天清早，李达云等就起来检查了工具。吃了早饭，各人就架上犁赶着牛出了工。一下田，五个人就展开了竞赛，干得更起劲。
    这一天，他们五个人共犁了八点二亩冬板田，超过了每天犁七点五亩田的劳动定额。
    党支部书记的“假日”
    放假的那天，前进生产队的党支部书记邹新生一清早就来到了第二食堂。一进门，炊事员唐菊香等就亲切地问：“邹支书，你今天起得这么早，准备到那里去呀？”党支部书记高兴地说：“帮你们来做饭呀！”
    “帮我们来做饭？我们不是都在这里吗？用不着你来帮忙啊！”许元华指着自己和正忙碌的唐菊香、姜梅英两人说。
    “你们每天都起早贪黑的工作着，别人放了假，你们还要煮饭，真是辛苦了。今天放假，我没有事，特地来帮帮你们的忙。”说罢，他就动手帮助量米、蒸饭。接着，又挑起水桶到塘里挑水去了。许元华看见党支部书记说得如此恳切，心里乐滋滋地对唐菊香说：“今天是假日，我们一定要把饭菜搞好，使大家吃得满意，玩得快乐。”大家都高兴地点了点头。
    炒菜前，邹新生已担好了水，放下担子，又问大家：“今天是个假日，你们准备搞些什么好菜给大家吃？”许元华把手一指说：“昨晚准备了白菜片了。”
    “还有吗？”
    “再加一个刀豆干炒辣椒。”
    “我都同意。”党支部书记点头说：“不过要炒得好一点。炒白菜时火要烧得大，还要放点辣椒，使大家吃了感到有味道。”说罢，他就动手烧火，帮着他们炒起菜来。
    八点半钟，食堂开饭了。这一餐，每个桌子上都摆了一大钵子白菜片子，一钵子辣椒炒刀豆干。一位老社员一边吃着一边向邻桌的一个青年说：“今早的白菜片为什么比往常的特别好吃一些？”那青年人凑近他的耳朵轻声地说：“今早的白菜片是我们的邹支书亲自掌握的。”老人满意地笑了。
    这时，有人在桌上念了快板：“支书下厨房，伙食大变样；虽是平常菜，味道特别香。”大家都说：“念得好！念得好！”
    双塘生产队党支部书记姜运成在假日这一天，还到贫农社员家里逐户访问。他首先到社员姚书全的家里，他知道姚书全今年1月因公负伤，现在还在休养。这时姚书全正想买点酒吃帮助通风活血，但一时手里缺钱，还没买成。姜运成知道他的要求，立即借给八角多钱，又问他还有什么困难没有？姚书全十分感动地说：“没有要求了。我跌伤后，党和政府这样关心我，给我请医生治，大队也借了三十多元，我还有什么困难呢？我只有等伤好了，加紧出工报答党和公社的恩情。”
    社员们的假日活动是多种多样，有人在家处理家务，有人出门去走亲戚……，但是，效果都是一样：人们劳动十来天，休息一次，处理处理自己的私事，第二天的生产干劲就更足了。（附图片）
