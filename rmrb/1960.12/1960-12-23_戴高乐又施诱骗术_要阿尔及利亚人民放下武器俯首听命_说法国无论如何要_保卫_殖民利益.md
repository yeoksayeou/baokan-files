Xinhua News Agency, December 21st – The bloodstains from the French colonial army's massacre of Algerian demonstrators are not yet dry, and President De Gaulle is once again implementing his political deception scheme towards the Algerian people.

In a speech on the 20th regarding his planned referendum on the Algerian question, De Gaulle once again attempted to entice the Algerian people to cease their struggle for national independence and liberation, and instead accept new French colonial rule in the "referendum" to be held on January 8th of next year.

In his speech, De Gaulle acted as if the mass slaughter of Algerian demonstrators by the French colonial army during his recent trip to Algeria had never occurred, and instead generously released smoke screens of "peace," "negotiations," and "self-determination."

In his speech, De Gaulle attempted to deceive the Algerian people by claiming that voting "yes" in the "referendum" meant supporting the principle of Algerian "self-determination." However, he then revealed his true intentions himself. He still insisted that only "after peace arrives" could the Algerian people "choose their own destiny." And the "peace" that De Gaulle speaks of, according to what he and his government have announced in the past, is that the Algerian National Liberation Army must lay down its arms, cease the war for independence, and allow the French government to arrange their future; in other words, surrender.

De Gaulle stated undisguisedly in his speech that the "resolution of the conditions for the Algerian people to freely exercise their right to self-determination" would not come until "the end of the final battles and atrocities." He said that France "hopes in the future not to deal with a disorganized and rebellious Algeria, but with a calm and responsible Algeria, that is, an Algeria that obeys France."

In his speech, De Gaulle not only failed to provide the minimum conditions for the Algerian people to freely express their will in the "referendum"—that is, the withdrawal of the French colonial army—but he also indicated that the French army would continue to remain in Algeria and praised this colonial army to the utmost. He described the French army's suppression of the Algerian people as "restoring order," saying that the army "is carrying out and will continue to carry out" this task. De Gaulle even praised the recent atrocities of the French army in opening fire and killing and wounding thousands of Algerian patriots, saying that this massacre was "carrying out (the French colonial authorities') orders."

In his speech, De Gaulle declared that if he obtained a majority in the "referendum," he would immediately establish executive bodies and parliamentary organizations in Algeria. He also said that power would be decentralized to provincial and regional organizations established according to geographical and ethnic differences. He said that organizations with authority in Algerian territory would also be established, such as organizations to implement the Constantine Plan. This passage from De Gaulle reveals that the French ruling clique is preparing, under the pretext of establishing "public administrative institutions," to establish French-controlled organizations to plunder Algeria's resources and divide Algeria. Parisian newspapers had previously revealed that De Gaulle had a vicious plan, the so-called division of the mountainous areas where the Algerian people live and the wealthy coastal areas and Sahara regions occupied by colonialists into different regions and provinces according to geography and "ethnicity," in order to facilitate France's implementation of "divide and rule."

At the same time, De Gaulle clamored in his speech that "no matter what happens (in Algeria), France is determined to defend" the interests of French colonists.

### 戴高乐又施诱骗术  要阿尔及利亚人民放下武器俯首听命  说法国无论如何要“保卫”殖民利益

    戴高乐又施诱骗术
    要阿尔及利亚人民放下武器俯首听命
    说法国无论如何要“保卫”殖民利益
    新华社21日讯　法国殖民军屠杀阿尔及利亚示威群众的血迹未干，总统戴高乐又在向阿尔及利亚人民施行他的政治欺骗阴谋。
    戴高乐在20日就他关于阿尔及利亚问题公民投票的计划发表了一篇演说，再次企图诱使阿尔及利亚人民停止争取民族独立和解放的斗争，而在将于明年1月8日举行的“公民投票”中接受法国新的殖民统治。
    戴高乐在演说时，好像没有发生过在他最近的阿尔及利亚之行期间，法国殖民军大批屠杀阿尔及利亚示威群众的事情似的，而大事施放“和平”、“谈判”、“自决”等烟幕。
    戴高乐在演说里企图欺骗阿尔及利亚人民，说什么在“公民投票”中投赞成票就是赞成阿尔及利亚“自决”原则，但是，接着他自己却露出了马脚。他仍然坚持要到“和平到来之后”，阿尔及利亚人民才能“选择自己的命运”。而戴高乐所说的“和平”，按照他和他的政府历次所宣布的，就是阿尔及利亚民族解放军放下武器，停止争取独立的战争，听任法国政府安排他们的出路，换句话说，那就是投降。
    戴高乐在演说中毫不掩饰地表明，阿尔及利亚人民“自由行使自决权的条件的解决”，要到“最后的战斗与暴行结束”以后。他说什么法国“希望将来不是同一个无组织的和叛乱的阿尔及利亚，而是与一个平静与负责的阿尔及利亚，也就是对法国俯首听命的阿尔及利亚打交道”。
    戴高乐在演说中不仅没有为了使阿尔及利亚人民在“公民投票”中能够自由表达意志提供起码的条件，即撤退法国殖民军，而且他表示法国军队将继续留在阿尔及利亚，并对这支殖民军队极力加以表扬。他把法国军队对阿尔及利亚人民的镇压说成是“恢复治安”，他说，军队“正在进行并且将继续执行”这个任务。戴高乐甚至赞扬法国军队最近开枪打死和杀伤成千阿尔及利亚爱国者的暴行，说这次屠杀是“执行（法国殖民当局的）命令”。
    戴高乐在演说中申明，如果他在“公民投票”中取得多数，他将马上在阿尔及利亚建立执行机构和议会组织。他还说，权力将分散给因地理及人种不同而设立的省与区域组织。他说，还将成立在阿尔及利亚领土上有权的组织，如执行君士坦丁计划组织。戴高乐这一段话透露了法国统治集团准备在建立“公共行政机构”的借口下，成立由法国控制的掠夺阿尔及利亚富源的机构和分裂阿尔及利亚。巴黎报纸早就透露，戴高乐有一个恶毒的计划，就是所谓按照地理及“人种”，将阿尔及利亚人民聚居的山区和殖民主义分子霸占的沿海富庶地区和撒哈拉地区划分为不同地区和省区，以便于法国实行“分治”。
    同时，戴高乐在演说中叫嚷，“无论（在阿尔及利亚）发生什么情况，法国都决心要保卫”法国殖民者的利益。
