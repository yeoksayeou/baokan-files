To strive for next year's wheat production to surpass previous years, the Shixi Production Team has mobilized the masses to find solutions.
Qingtian County is carrying out a competition to learn from and catch up with the Shixi Team, cultivating wheat fields to high standards.
(Our Dispatch) The Party branch of the Shixi Production Team in Qingtian County's Suburban Commune, Zhejiang Province, has mobilized the masses to find solutions, while simultaneously focusing on the advanced, helping the backward, and leading the intermediate, strengthening wheat field management. Currently, the broad masses of cadres and commune members in Qingtian County have launched a competition to catch up and surpass the Shixi Team in cultivating winter wheat.

This year, the wheat acreage of the Shixi Production Team was expanded by 20% compared to last year, with sufficient base fertilizer and uniform sowing, resulting in good growth. As long as management is strengthened, there is great hope for achieving high yields. However, due to uneven development among the teams, the Party branch adopted the approach of helping the advanced teams summarize their experiences and helping the backward teams catch up with the advanced, to promote the entire team to intensify spring management.

Summarize Advanced Experiences
The Party branch first went deep into a group of the Tantou Team, mobilizing commune members to summarize advanced experiences in field management. Members of the "Living Shen Nong" group discovered that last year, the relationship between "water," "fertilizer," and wheat growth was not well resolved. As a result, although there were many tillers, the number of effective ears was not high. Last year, each mu of wheat developed 500,000 to 650,000 plants, but there were only 270,000 to 280,000 ears. If early and abundant tillering is achieved, with an additional 300,000 seedlings of "offspring wheat" per mu in addition to the "mother wheat," and striving for half of them to become effective tillers, production can be further increased. Therefore, everyone believes that striving to increase the effective tillers by 150,000 seedlings per mu is a crucial key to this year's wheat field management. At the same time, they also studied the reasons why there were many "offspring wheat" but few effective ears last year: ① uneven emergence due to drought during the emergence period, affecting tillering; ② insufficient late fertilizer application, and the fertilizer could not meet the needs of all wheat seedlings; ③ lack of water during the tillering period. Based on last year's experience and the characteristics of this year's expanded winter sowing area, everyone put forward high standards for field management, starting early to cultivate and strive for early and abundant tillering.

Determine Measures According to Local Conditions
After summarizing advanced experiences, the Party branch immediately organized all team members to promote the practices of this group. This has brought together many good experiences, enriched the high standards of cultivation, and resolved the issues of whether irrigation, increased topdressing, and early cultivation of wheat would lead to excessive growth and premature heading. According to past experience and combined with this year's actual situation, commune members believe that only wheat that is sown too early and cultivated out of season will head prematurely. Vigorously growing wheat will not head prematurely if reasonable fertilization is mastered. Excessive growth can also be prevented. As long as seedling suppression work is done well during the seedling stage, it will not only prevent excessive growth but also make the plants strong and prevent lodging.

In the process of promoting advanced experiences, the branch paid great attention to giving play to the initiative of the small team and commune members, listening to the opinions of the masses, and ensuring that measures are adapted to local conditions. For example, the Huangbianyang Team, with more than 30 mu of wheat fields, has a high groundwater level, insufficient sunshine, and poor cold resistance. The team cadres and commune members jointly discussed and, in addition to adopting the advanced experiences of general teams, also adopted measures such as ditching and drainage, and applying heavy ash fertilizer to keep warm, to achieve the high standard cultivation requirements of promoting early and vigorous wheat seedlings. The Jingzhongyang Team, with more than 120 mu of wheat fields, has deep soil and sufficient fertility. The team applied thin human manure to grasp seedling suppression, which can both promote early tillering and prevent excessive growth.

Help the Backward Catch Up with the Advanced
While focusing on the advanced, the Party branch also strengthened leadership and assistance to the backward teams, encouraging them to strive to catch up with the advanced. Some commune members of the Houyang Team believed that their team's conditions were poor and they lacked confidence in exceeding contracted production and achieving overall high yields. Guo Songxi, deputy secretary of the Party branch, went deep into this team, mobilizing the masses to find advanced factors. After analysis and comparison, the commune members saw that this year, their team's 17 mu of continuous cropping rice had an average yield per mu that was 20 jin higher than the late rice of the advanced Tantou Team in the same field, mainly because field management was tightly grasped and cultivation was timely. This fact greatly encouraged the commune members of the Houyang Team, who said: Whether or not overall high yields can be achieved mainly depends on our own efforts. The entire team immediately organized 60% of its labor force to invest in field management. Now the wheat has been hoed once, 12 dan of fertilizer have been applied per mu, the seedlings have been supplemented, and the growth is relatively balanced, becoming one of the advanced teams in the entire production team's spring management.

Field Management is Fast and Good
Due to focusing on the advanced, helping the backward, and leading the intermediate, the wheat field management of the Shixi Production Team's teams has become universally active. Now, each team has organized 220 full and half laborers to participate in the fertilizer accumulation campaign, while mobilizing women half laborers to burn more than 2,000 dan of rice roots into ash mud for fertilizer. Each team also went to the county town to collect pit sand, cleaned a large amount of pit sand from the team's 72 toilets for fertilizer, and the commune members actively sold domestic fertilizer to the production team. Therefore, in addition to the fertilizer that has already been topdressed, the entire team has also stored a lot of high-quality fertilizer, enough for the first intertillage topdressing needs of spring management. In the past few days, each team has also rushed to make 40 deep plowing hoes and double-tooth hoes, repaired more than 30 deep plowing hoes, 50 pairs of manure buckets, 7 fertilizer applicators, and some roller-type seedling suppression machines, which has greatly accelerated the progress of field management. Now the progress of transplanting and replanting seedlings, irrigation, intertillage topdressing, and other work is very fast, and the quality of field management has been greatly improved.

The Entire County Learns From and Catches Up with the Shixi Team
The Qingtian County Party Committee attaches great importance to the Shixi Production Team's wheat management practices and, after the end of winter planting in the entire county, has widely used methods such as on-site meetings to comprehensively promote the experiences of the Shixi Team. The Hubian Production Team, separated from the Shixi Team by a river, had almost every commune member visit the Shixi Team to learn. In the competition to learn from and catch up with Shixi, cadres at all levels took the lead in learning, and according to the experiences of the Shixi Team, formulated production increase measures for their own communes and teams based on local conditions, and made model demonstrations. He Hongyuan, secretary of the Zhangcun Commune Party Committee, led more than 130 cadres to visit the Shixi Team, immediately went to the fields to set an example, and promoted the experiences of the Shixi Team, which quickly changed the appearance of the wheat fields. In the process of promoting the experiences of the Shixi Team, the communes and production teams paid special attention to listening to the opinions of the small team cadres and commune members, learning from others' strengths and making up for their own shortcomings. This not only promoted the experiences of the Shixi Team but also summarized many good experiences of their own communes and teams, making the production increase measures more practical and concrete, and better promoting high-standard management of wheat fields. The Zhudianqian Production Team of the Chuanliao Commune had 23 mu of wheat fields with uneven emergence and poor growth last year. The commune members analyzed the reasons in light of the experiences of the Shixi Team and found that the reason was insufficient and untimely irrigation. At the same time, they also summarized the experiences of some of their team's wheat fields that achieved high yields due to good management. After these experiences were promoted, the quality of winter wheat management was greatly improved.

After Qingtian County launched the competition to learn from Shixi and catch up with Shixi, more than 55,000 people are investing in field management centered on fertilizer accumulation every day. More than 42,000 mu of wheat fields in the county have undergone one intertillage, topdressing, and irrigation, laying a good foundation for high yields of winter wheat.

    力争明年小麦产量超过往年  石溪生产队发动群众找窍门
    青田县开展学、赶石溪队竞赛，高标准培育麦田
    本报讯　浙江青田县城郊公社石溪生产队党支部发动群众找窍门，同时抓先进、帮后进、带中间，加强了小麦田间管理工作。目前，青田县广大干部和社员掀起了追、赶石溪队培育冬麦的竞赛运动。
    石溪生产队今年小麦面积比去年扩大20％，基肥足、落籽匀，生长良好。只要加强管理，争取高产大有希望。但是，各队生产发展不平衡，党支部就采取帮先进队总结经验，帮后进队赶先进，推动全队加紧培育春花。
    总结先进经验
    党支部首先深入坦头小队一个小组，发动社员总结了田间管理的先进经验。“活神农”小组的社员总结发现去年对“水”、“肥”与小麦生长的关系还解决得不好，因此，分蘖虽然多，但有效穗数不多。去年每亩小麦发棵达到五十万株至六十五万株，但麦穗只二十七万个至二十八万个。如果做到早发棵多发棵，每亩除“娘麦”以外再增加“子孙麦”三十万苗，并争取其中半数成为有效分蘖，就可以进一步增产。因此，大家认为争取每亩增加十五万苗有效分蘖是今年小麦田间管理中的一个重要关键。同时，他们也研究了去年“子孙麦”多、有效穗数少的原因：①出苗期由于天气干旱，出苗不齐，影响发棵；②腊肥未施足，肥分不能满足全部麦苗的需要，③发棵期水分缺少。大家参照去年经验与今年冬播面积扩大的特点，提出了高标准田间管理的要求，马上动手早培育，力争早分蘖、多分蘖。
    因地制宜定措施
    在总结先进经验后，党支部又马上组织全队社员推广这个小组的做法。这样，就集中了许多好经验，丰富了高标准培育的措施，解决了小麦灌水、增施追肥、提早培育后会不会产生陡长与过早抽穗地问题。社员们根据过去的经验，结合今年的实际情况认为只有播种过早、培育失时的小麦才会过早抽穗，生长旺盛的小麦掌握合理施肥便不会过早抽穗。陡长也是可以防止的，只要苗期做好压苗工作，不仅不会陡长，而且生长粗壮，不会倒伏。
    在推广先进经验的过程中，支部十分注意发挥小队和社员的主动性，听取群众意见，做到因地制宜。例如黄边垟小队三十多亩麦田，地下水位较高，日照不足，抗寒能力较差，小队干部和社员共同商量，除了采取一般小队的先进经验外，还采取了开沟排水、重施灰肥保暖的措施，以达到促使麦苗早发旺发的高标准培育要求。警钟垟小队一百二十多亩麦田，土层深厚，肥力足，小队便施用稀薄人粪，抓紧压苗，既能促进早发棵，又能防止陡长。
    帮后进赶先进
    党支部在大抓先进的基础上，同时加强了对后进小队的领导和帮助，鼓励他们奋力赶先进。后垟小队有些社员认为自己小队条件差，对超包产，实现全面高产信心不足。党支部副书记郭松溪便深入到这个小队，发动群众找先进因素。社员们经过分析比较，看到今年自己小队的十七亩连作稻，平均亩产量比同一坂田里坦头先进小队的晚稻高二十斤，主要原因是田间管理抓得紧，培育适时。这个事实大大鼓舞了后垟小队的社员，他们说：能不能实现全面高产，主要看自己努力不努力。全小队马上组织了60％的劳力投入田间管理。现在小麦都已铲过一次，每亩施了十二担肥，补齐了苗，生长比较平衡，成为全生产队春花田间管理的先进小队之一。
    田间管理又快又好
    由于抓先进、帮后进、带中间，石溪生产队各小队的麦田管理工作普遍活跃起来。现在，各小队共组织了二百二十个整半劳力投入积肥运动，同时发动妇女半劳力把二千多担稻根烧成火灰泥作肥料。各小队还到县城捞坑沙，从全队七十二个厕所中清理出大量坑沙作肥料，社员们还积极向生产队投售家肥。因此全队除已追施的肥料以外，还贮存许多优质肥料，足够春花第一次中耕追肥需要。几天来，各小队还赶制了四十把深耕锄和双齿锄，修理了三十多把深耕锄、五十双粪桶、七个施肥器和部分滚筒式压苗机，因而大大加快了田间管理的进度。现在移栽补苗、灌水、中耕追肥等工作进度很快，田间管理质量大大提高。
    全县学、赶石溪队
    中共青田县委十分重视石溪生产队管理小麦的做法，在全县冬种结束之后，广泛运用现场会等方式，全面推广石溪队的经验。和石溪队一江之隔的湖边生产队，几乎每一个社员都到石溪队去参观学习。在学石溪、赶石溪的竞赛运动中，各级干部都带头学习，而且根据石溪队的经验，因地制宜地订出本社本队的增产措施，并做样板示范。章村公社党委书记贺洪元带领一百三十多名干部在石溪队参观后，马上下田做样子，推广石溪队的经验，使麦田面貌迅速改观。各公社、生产队在推广石溪队的经验中，特别注意听取小队干部和社员的意见，做到取人之长，补己之短，这样不仅推广了石溪队的经验，也总结了本社本队的许多好经验，使增产措施更加切实具体，更好地促进了高标准管理麦田。船寮公社朱店前生产队去年有二十三亩麦田出苗不齐，生长不好。社员们对照石溪队的经验进行分析，找出了原因是由于灌水不足不及时，同时他们还总结了本队一些麦田由于管理好获得高产的经验，这些经验推广后，冬麦管理质量大大提高。
    青田县掀起学石溪、赶石溪的竞赛后，每天有五万五千多人投入以积肥为中心的田间管理运动。全县已有四万二千多亩麦田进行了一次中耕、追肥与灌水，为冬麦高产打下了良好基础。
