To motivate the masses and cadres to cultivate poor and remote land effectively is a significant issue in the mass movement to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production.

In any place, in any commune and production team, the fertility of the land and its proximity to residential areas will not be the same. There will always be some cultivated land that is relatively good and close, and some cultivated land that is relatively poor and far away. These lands, which now seem relatively remote and poor, have enormous potential for increased production. Various types of low-yielding land across the country, such as saline-alkali land, sandy land, sticky land, rotten mud fields, and barren mountainous land, account for approximately three-tenths of the country's cultivated land area. If you add low-lying, flood-prone land, the proportion is even greater. In recent years, about half of these poor lands have undergone preliminary improvement. This is an important factor in the continuous increase in crop yields. There is still a lot of land relatively far from residential areas, some of which is quite fertile. Many remote lands, due to years of neglect in management, lack fertilizer and water, and lack thorough weeding and pest control, have become poor land after a few years of rough cultivation. As long as we make every effort to cultivate remote land within our capabilities, we can also significantly increase the production of grain and other agricultural products. Last winter and this spring, tens of millions of mu of relatively remote wasteland were newly opened across the country and planted as they were opened. The harvested grain played a considerable role in alleviating this year's natural disasters. We must view these poor and remote lands from a global perspective. Viewed in isolation, even if the same amount of labor and capital is invested in the same area of poor and remote land as in good and nearby land, it is not easy to obtain the same harvest. This is a fact. However, in order to increase the total output of agricultural products, we must adhere to the policy of "walking on two legs," not only requiring that good and nearby land be cultivated even better, striving for high yields and more harvests, but also requiring that poor and remote land be planted and cultivated well, striving for more planting and more harvests. It is relatively easy to plant an additional mu of poor or remote land and harvest an additional dozens or even more than one hundred jin of grain per year. On existing good and nearby land, where yields are already relatively high, it would be more difficult to harvest an additional dozens or more than one hundred jin of grain with the same labor and capital as planting an additional mu of poor or remote land. Planting more, "if the east is not bright, the west will be," which is also of great benefit for disaster prevention. China's per capita cultivated land area is relatively small. How to fully and rationally utilize poor and remote land is an important issue for a very long time. Land is not static. Through transformation, poor land can become good; under certain conditions, good land can become poor. There will always be relatively poor and remote land at any time. The issue of fully tapping the potential of poor and remote land deserves our close attention every year.

In the old society and in capitalist societies, the utilization of remote and poor land was mainly governed by differential rent and private land ownership. People were only willing to cultivate remote and poor land when the rent on remote and poor land was relatively low. When most of the good and nearby land was occupied by landlords and rich peasants, poor peasants had no choice but to cultivate poor and remote land using the method of extensive planting and meager harvesting in order to make a living. Under conditions where there is no land rent and where land is publicly owned, the limitations on land utilization have been broken, and people's ability to transform nature and utilize land has been greatly enhanced, and the productive forces have been greatly liberated. In recent years, many low-yielding fields have been transformed into high-yielding fields. Some remote lands have also gained better cultivation conditions after implementing measures such as moving livestock pens to the mountains, establishing field fertilizer bases, rationally arranging threshing grounds, establishing field canteens and temporary accommodations during busy farming seasons, and improving transportation. However, on the other hand, some units do not pay much attention to poor and remote land. The reasons for this are, on the one hand, that people in these units lack a comprehensive understanding of the two factors of increasing production (increasing yield per unit area and expanding cultivated area), and on the other hand, that they have not taken appropriate and clear measures to encourage the planting of poor and remote land. In the new situation of great changes in production relations and rapid development of productive forces, although we have favorable conditions for making poor and remote land play a fuller role, in order to fully utilize these favorable conditions, we must strengthen ideological work and establish necessary systems and implement correct policies, that is, to make the superstructure adapt to the economic base and adjust production relations to promote the faster and more comprehensive development of productive forces.

In terms of ideological education, it is necessary to make cadres at all levels of the commune and all commune members deeply understand the correctness and importance of the policy of simultaneously promoting extensive planting and high yields. In order to achieve the great victory of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, we must not only try every possible means to obtain better harvests on existing good and nearby land, but also overcome all kinds of difficulties to transform poor land and conquer remote land, and seize greater victories on a broader front. Vigorously developing agriculture and grain production is a long-term, arduous, and great struggle. We must open up remote land that our predecessors have not opened up, and we must transform poor land that our predecessors have not transformed. We must make the entire land and the entire countryside take on a new look in our generation. We must advocate the communist attitude of labor of consciously "choosing the heavier burden to bear" in dealing with poor land, and bravely conquer remote land with the spirit of "the Red Army fearing no hardship of a long march." Since building socialism, vigorously developing agriculture, and grain production require cultivating poor and remote land well, the heroic commune members of the people's communes and the most advanced units should actively undertake this more difficult but very glorious task.

In terms of systems and policies, the most important thing is to make production management and income distribution (including reward systems) adapt to the current stage of the people's commune system of three-level ownership with the production team as the basic unit. In order to ensure that both poor and remote land can be rationally utilized, it is necessary to enable production teams and production brigades to fully play their initiative and creativity in production and management under the unified leadership of the commune. Under the conditions of completing the overall production plan and completing the contracted production tasks, how cultivated land is utilized and how crops are planted should be discussed by the commune members and jointly formulated by the production team and production brigade. Production targets for poor and remote land should be specified separately, and contracted production targets should also be specified separately. Scattered and fragmented land can be excluded from the contracted production land. The rewards for increased production should not only be based on the average yield per unit area, but also on the total output increase rate, the per capita output increase rate, and the commodity rate of the products. Material rewards should mainly be cash rewards; on the premise of ensuring the completion of the procurement tasks, a small portion of grain can also be awarded to encourage units with high total output and high per capita grain production to store some, or to eat a little more appropriately under the principle of thrift. Since more labor must be paid to harvest the same amount of grain on poor and remote land, the distribution system and the formulation of work evaluation and point calculation, labor quotas, etc., must be adapted to such actual conditions. Communes and production teams should give appropriate assistance and care to production teams and production brigades with more poor and remote land.

Now is the time for a winter summary of the production experience of the past year and the construction experience of the communes in the past three years. We must pay attention to summarizing the experience of planting poor and remote land; when formulating next year's production plan, we must carefully consider how to cultivate poor and remote land well, so as to prepare well ideologically and materially as soon as possible. We believe that under the guidance of correct ideas and with the guarantee of correct systems and policies, we will be able to greatly improve the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members in planting poor and remote land, march more forcefully and effectively towards nature, transform poor land into good land, and make remote land catch up with nearby land, and achieve the great victory of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production.

### 把坏地种成好地

    把坏地种成好地
    如何调动群众和干部的积极性把坏地和远地种好，是大办农业、大办粮食的群众运动中的一个重要问题。
    在任何地方，在任何一个公社和生产队，土地的肥沃程度和离居民点远近都不会相同，总有一些耕地比较好、比较近，一些耕地比较坏、比较远。在这些现在看来比较远、比较坏的土地上，有巨大的增产潜力。全国各地各种低产的土地，像盐碱地、沙土地、粘土地、烂泥田、山岭瘠薄土地等，占全国耕地面积大约十分之三，加上低洼易涝地就更多。这些坏地，在近几年中，已经有大约一半经过初步改良。这是农作物产量不断增加的一个重要因素。离居民点比较远的土地还有很多，其中有些是相当肥沃的土地；有很多远地，由于多年来没有好好经营，缺肥缺水，除虫除草都不细致，结果粗种几年以后就变成了坏地。只要在力所能及的条件下尽力种好远地，也能大量地增产粮食和其它农产品。去冬今春全国各地新开了较远的荒地几千万亩随开随种，收获的粮食对于减轻今年的灾荒起了相当大的作用。我们一定要用全局观点来看待这些坏地和远地。孤立起来看，在同样面积的坏地、远地上投入的劳动力和资金即使同好地、近地上同样多，却不容易得到同样的收获物。这是事实。可是，为了农产品总产量的提高，必须坚持“两条腿走路”的方针，不但要求把好地、近地种得更好，力求高产多收，同时也要求把坏地、远地种上、种好，力求多种多收。多种一亩坏地、远地，一年多收几十斤以至一百多斤粮食是比较容易做到的；在原有的好地、近地上，在产量已经比较高的情况下，再付出多种一亩坏地、远地同样的劳动力和资金，要多收几十斤、一百多斤粮食就比较困难。种得多，“东方不亮西方亮”，对于防灾也大有好处。我国按人口平均占有的耕地面积比较小，如何把坏地、远地都充分地合理地利用起来，在很长的时期内都是一个重要问题。土地并不是静止不变的，经过改造，坏地可以变好；在一定条件下，好地又可以变坏。任何时候，总是会有比较坏、比较远的土地。充分发挥坏地、远地的潜力这个问题，每年都值得我们密切注意。
    在旧社会，在资本主义社会，远地、坏地的利用，主要是受着级差地租和土地私有权的支配。在远地、坏地的地租比较少的情况下，才有人愿意种远地、坏地。在好地、近地绝大部分都被地主、富农占有着的情况下，贫苦的农民为了谋求生路才不得不用广种薄收的办法去种坏地、远地。在没有了地租的条件下，在土地公有的条件下，利用土地的局限性已经打破了，人们改造自然、利用土地的力量大大增强了，生产力大大地解放了。近几年来，已经有许多低产田经过改造，变成了高产田。有些远地，在推行畜圈上山、建立田间肥料基地、合理布置打谷场、农忙时期建立田间食堂和临时住宿地等等措施和改善交通运输情况之后，也有了较好的耕作条件。可是，另一方面，也有一些单位对坏地、远地不大重视。其原因，一方面是这些单位的人们对于增产的两个因素（提高单位产量和扩大耕地面积）缺乏全面的理解，另方面是没有采取适当的明确的鼓励种坏地、种远地的办法。在生产关系大大改变、生产力突飞猛进的新的情况下，虽然我们有了使坏地、远地更充分地发挥作用的有利条件，可是，要充分利用这些有利条件，还必须加强思想工作和建立必要的制度、实行正确的政策，也就是使上层建筑同经济基础相适应，调整生产关系以促进生产力更快更全面地发展。
    在思想教育方面，要使公社各级干部和全体社员都深切了解广种多收和高产多收同时并举的方针的正确性和重要性。为了取得大办农业、大办粮食的伟大胜利，既要想尽千方百计在现有的好地和近地上取得更好的收成，又要克服千苦万难改造坏地、征服远地，在更广阔的阵地上夺取更大的战果。大办农业、大办粮食是一场长期的、艰巨的、伟大的斗争，前人没有开辟的远地我们要去开辟，前人没有改造的坏地我们要去改造。要使整个大地、整个农村在我们这一代人手里变得焕然一新。要提倡自觉地用“担子拣重的挑”的共产主义的劳动态度对待坏地，勇敢地用“红军不怕远征难”的精神征服远地。既然建设社会主义、大办农业、大办粮食需要把坏地、远地种好，英雄的人民公社社员，最先进的单位，就应该积极地担负起这个比较艰难、但是十分光荣的任务。
    在制度和政策方面，最重要的是使生产管理和收益分配（包括奖励制度）同三级所有、队为基础的现阶段人民公社的根本制度相适应。为了做到坏地、远地都能合理利用，就必须使生产队和生产小队在生产经营方面能够在公社统一领导下充分发挥主动性、创造性。在完成总的生产计划、完成包产任务的条件下，耕地怎样利用、作物怎样种植，应该经过社员群众讨论，由生产队和生产小队共同商量制定。坏地、远地的产量指标应当分别规定，包产指标也应该另行规定。零星分散的，可以不算在包产地亩以内。对增产的奖励，不要光以平均单位产量作依据，还要看总产量增加率、按人口平均产量增加率、产品的商品率。物质奖励，主要是奖现金；在保证完成征购任务的前提下，也可以奖一小部分粮食，鼓励总产量高、按人口平均生产粮食多的单位储存一些，也可以在节约的原则下适当地多吃一些。在坏地、远地上收获同样多的粮食既然要付出较多的劳动，分配制度和评工计分、劳动定额的制定等等，就都要同这样的实际情况相适应。对于坏地、远地较多的生产队、生产小队，公社和生产队应该给以适当的帮助和照顾。
    目前正是冬季总结一年生产经验和近三年来公社建设经验的时候，一定要注意总结种坏地、远地的经验；在制定明年生产计划时，一定要认真考虑如何把坏地、远地种好，以便早早作好思想准备和物质准备。我们相信，在正确的思想指导下，在正确的制度和政策保证下，一定能够大大提高广大社员群众种坏地、种远地的积极性，更有力更有效地向大自然进军，把坏地种成好地，使远地猛追近地，取得大办农业、大办粮食的伟大胜利。
