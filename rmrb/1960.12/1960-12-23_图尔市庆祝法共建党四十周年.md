    Tours Celebrates the Fortieth Anniversary of the Founding of the French Communist Party

    A grand gathering was held in Tours, the birthplace of the French Communist Party, on December 18 to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the French Communist Party.

    The celebration was attended by a delegation from the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, led by Roger, member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party. Also attending the meeting were veteran members of the French Communist Party, active members of local committees, representatives of local masses, and social organizations.

    The delegation from the Central Committee of the French Communist Party visited the Maignejan Building, where the historic congress was held forty years ago. It was at this congress, attended by outstanding representatives of the French working class, that the French Communist Party was founded.

    Roger spoke at the celebration, introducing the activities of the French Communist Party. He emphasized that the French Communist Party has always firmly defended the interests of the French working class and working peasants, and has won their admiration with its indomitable stand.
