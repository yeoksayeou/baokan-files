    “Mountains” and “Rivers”
    ——Observations and Essays
    Shí Yàn

    "Mention Golden Queen,
    Makes folks want to heave.
    Climbed several mountain ridges,
    Still an empty burden to weave."

Golden Queen is a superior variety of corn. Just looking at the name, one can infer its status.

However, the Golden Queen superior variety failed when planted in the high mountains. And the failure was severe: little or no harvest. The above folk rhyme reflects the complaints of the masses.

For Comrade Wang Shijun, the Party Committee Secretary of Guo Town People's Commune in Lüeyang County, the failure did not bring disappointment, but aroused his contemplation. He thought: "Why is it 'climbed several mountain ridges' instead of 'crossed several rivers'? There must be a reason." He is a person who gets to the bottom of things, so he went to the masses to investigate.

Sure enough, there is a big difference between "mountains" and "rivers," though they differ by only one character. The investigation proved that all the Golden Queen planted in the riverbanks yielded a bumper harvest. Among them, the several mu of land planted by commune member Feng Xiuying produced over a thousand jin per mu. It turned out that Golden Queen is suitable for planting in riverbank areas with thick soil layers, but not suitable for planting in cold high mountains with thin soil layers. Comrade Wang Shijun moved the Golden Queen down the mountain, and the following year, there was a widespread bumper harvest, restoring the reputation of "superior" of the "superior variety."

A certain seed needs certain soil, climate, and conditions. Leaving the certain soil, climate, and conditions, even if it is a superior variety, blind planting will not yield a good harvest.

Truth is always specific. The commendable point of Comrade Wang Shijun is that he does not stop at or satisfy himself with generalized deployments and calls, but specifically solves specific problems. Contradictions often exist in two aspects: one is the universality of contradictions; the other is the particularity of contradictions. Comrade Wang Shijun, while grasping the universality of contradictions, particularly emphasizes the particularity of contradictions, thereby adopting different methods to solve different contradictions. When Golden Queen failed to grow in the high mountains, he neither negated the "superiority" of the "superior variety" without analysis nor continued to work blindly after the failure. Instead, he traced the cause of the failure, studied the characteristics of the superior variety, prescribed the right medicine, and adapted to local conditions. His commendable point also lies in: starting from reality, he made a serious and comprehensive review of the lessons of failure and the experience of success. Therefore, he saw success from failure, and saw the dawn ahead from tearing open the curtain woven by clouds and fog.

Seeing the problem from the one-character difference between "mountains" and "rivers" naturally illustrates a person's political sensitivity. However, this sensitivity is neither innate nor accidental. It is the spark of wisdom that bursts out from the experience of the masses through individual investigation and research, and deep consideration!

    “山”与“川”
    ——见闻随笔
    石燕
    “提起金皇后，
    叫人把气呕。
    翻了几架山，
    还是空背斗。”
    金皇后是玉米中的良种。单看这个名字，也就可以推知它的身价。
    可是，金皇后良种在高山种植居然失败了。而且失败得厉害：很少收获，乃至几乎没有什么收获。上述那首歌谣，反映了群众的埋怨情绪。
    对略阳县郭镇人民公社党委书记王世俊同志说来，失败并没有带来失望，而是引起他的沉思。他想：“为什么是翻了几架山，而不是过了几条川呢，其中定有缘故。”他是个穷根究底的人，于是到群众中去调查。
    果然，“山”与“川”虽一字之差，却大有讲究。调查证明：凡是金皇后种在河坝的，莫不丰收，其中社员冯秀英种的几亩地，亩产竟在千斤以上。原来金皇后宜于种在土层厚的河坝地区，不宜于种在土层薄的寒冷高山。王世俊同志把金皇后请下山来，第二年普遍丰收。为“良种”之“良”，恢复了名誉。
    一定的种籽，需要一定的土壤、气候、条件。离开了一定的土壤、气候、条件，即使是良种也罢，盲目种植，也不会得到好的收成。
    真理总是具体的。王世俊同志的可贵之处就在于：他不停留于、不满足于一般化的布置和号召，而是具体地解决具体问题。矛盾常常是存在着两方面的：一方面是矛盾的普遍性；又一方面是矛盾的特殊性，王世俊同志在掌握矛盾的普遍性同时，特别重视矛盾的特殊性，从而对不同的矛盾，采取不同的方法解决。金皇后在高山种植失败了，他既不是对“良种”之“良”，不加分析，一口否定；也不是失败之后，仍然一味蛮干。而是追查失败的原因，研究良种的特点，对症下药，因地制宜。他的可贵之处还在于：从实际出发，把失败的教训与成功的经验，作了认真的、通盘的审查。因此，从失败中看到成功，从撕开云雾所交织成的帷幕看到曙光就在前头。
    从“山”与“川”的一字之差，看出了问题，这自然是说明了一个人的政治敏感。但是，这敏感，一不是天生的，二不是偶然的。它是群众的经验通过个人的调查研究、深思熟虑所迸发出来的智慧的火花！
