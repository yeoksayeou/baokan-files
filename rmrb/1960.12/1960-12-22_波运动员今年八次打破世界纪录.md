   波运动员今年八次打破世界纪录
    据新华社华沙21日电　波兰运动员今年取得了很大成就，他们在田径、举重和跳伞运动中一共八次打破世界纪录，一百五十次刷新国家纪录。
    田径运动员今年取得的成绩特别出色。约瑟夫·施密特8月间在三级跳远中为波兰第一次创下了世界纪录，并且成为世界上第一个打破十七米大关的三级跳远运动员。
    克里兹科威克今年6月间在苏联举行的一次比赛中以八分三十一点四秒的成绩打破了男子三千米障碍赛跑的世界纪录。
    今年被认为是波兰女子田径史上成就最突出的一年。她们在大部分项目中的成绩都有很大提高，特别是在原来较薄弱的项目，如低栏和跳高等。
    波兰举重运动员的成绩近年来也有惊人的提高。著名举重运动员伊·帕林斯基今年三次打破了世界纪录。现在波兰拥有的世界纪录已经从去年的两项增加到今年的三项。从今年打破世界纪录的次数和保持世界纪录的项目计算，波兰已仅次于苏联而居世界第二位。波兰的女子滑翔运动员玛耶夫斯卡等三人今年也分别打破了世界纪录。波兰运动员今年在所参加的三百零七次国际比赛中胜一百五十五次，平二十四次。波兰体育运动的群众性今年也有了发展，例如今年共有二百三十万人参加各地区举办的体育比赛，有四十万人参加全国的越野赛跑，有六十万青少年参加了传统的全国田径比赛。
