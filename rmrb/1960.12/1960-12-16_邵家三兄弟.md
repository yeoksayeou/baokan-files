	The Shao Family's Three Brothers

	In Liu Village Production Team, Wenfeng Commune, Cangling County, Shandong Province, there are three good cadres who are loved by the commune members: Shao Liyan, the branch secretary; Shao Lixin, the production team leader; and Shao Lirui, the storekeeper. In their work, they act according to the Party's policies, listen to the opinions of the masses, care for the lives of the masses, and implement a work style of seeking truth from facts and hard struggle. These are the outstanding characteristics of the Shao family's three brothers in leading the masses in production, and also the outstanding characteristics of their leadership and organization of the lives of the masses since communization.

	Leading the Masses in Fighting Disasters

	The Liu Village Production Team (basic accounting unit) has 114 households with a population of 542, averaging just over nine fen of land per person. This year's more than 500 mu of crops were all achieved after a serious struggle against various natural disasters. In the spring, when the wheat was jointing, more than 150 mu of the 231 mu of wheat suffered from red spider infestations. Shao Liyan, upon returning from a meeting in the province in the evening, couldn't sleep well all night, pondering how to quickly eliminate the pests. Early the next morning, he convened a meeting of cadres to discuss pest control measures. They led more than 300 able-bodied people from the entire village, using sprayers, small cans, and sand pots to spray and water with 666 pesticide powder, fighting for two and a half days to basically treat the area once. After more than ten days, the wheat grew quickly. With careful management afterward, the wheat still had a good harvest.

	After the wheat harvest, the sun blazed, and it didn't rain for more than twenty days. The original plan was to plant beans on all the wheat stubble fields, but it was too dry and labor-intensive. Some people who relied on the weather wanted to wait for rain before planting beans, but the Shao brothers advocated planting sweet potatoes in the drought. Based on years of experience, they knew that sweet potatoes planted in dry weather would have shallow roots, grow round tubers, and produce more starch. However, the land was hard and dry, and four plowshares were broken while plowing the sweet potato furrows. Some people didn't want to continue and still wanted to wait for rain. The Shao brothers believed: "We must plow, planting crops must seize the season, one day earlier is one day earlier, waiting for rain is uncertain." Most of the commune members agreed with the Shao brothers' opinion, so they plowed the land, dug ditches, and built ridges while carrying water to plant sweet potatoes. After more than ten days of effort, they rushed to plant ninety mu of sweet potatoes. After planting, to prevent the sweet potatoes from suffering from drought, they carried water to water them twice a day with the commune members, and the seedlings grew quickly.

	In July, there were more than twenty consecutive days of rain. The sorghum fields were knee-deep in water, and the cornfields were waist-deep in water. Shao Liyan and Shao Lixin then led more than 100 men and women full and semi-laborers to dig two drainage ditches three feet deep and three feet wide in the rain. The water was too great to drain completely, and thirty-three mu of corn and millet were flooded. Seeing that it was not too late in the season and they could still plant, they discussed with the masses and decided to plow under the flooded crops and plant mung beans. However, the rain continued non-stop, and some of the planted mung beans were flooded again. What to do? They didn't lose heart: "If the mung beans are flooded, we'll plant carrots; having something to plant is better than nothing." They continued to mobilize the masses and boost morale, and a few people who lacked confidence also cheered up. Everyone worked together to plow under the flooded parts of the mung beans and plant carrots. As a result, the carrots yielded more than 1,000 jin per mu, and the mung beans yielded more than 90 jin per mu, turning a severe disaster into a light one.

	Eighteen Years of Hard Struggle

	The Shao family's three brothers not only led the masses to overcome serious natural disasters this year, but for the past eighteen years, under the leadership of the Party, they have been the guides for the masses in this village. Before liberation, Liu Village had only seventy or eighty households, and there were twenty families who fled famine and begged for food. People lacked food and clothing. Before 1957, this village always needed the state to supply tens of thousands of jin of grain every year; since the Great Leap Forward, it has changed from a grain-deficient village to a surplus-grain village. In 1958, the yield per mu was 500 jin, and in 1959 it increased to 603 jin, doubling the highest annual output before the war.

	Shao Lirui is sixty-five years old and was a model worker during the War of Resistance Against Japan; Shao Lixin is sixty years old and served as the head of the primary cooperative; Shao Liyan is fifty-five years old and was a village cadre during the War of Resistance Against Japan. They all served as armed work team members and participated in the struggle against the enemy. This year, their ages added together are exactly one hundred and eighty years old, so some young people in this village sometimes enthusiastically call them "one hundred and eighty." In all their work, they always act according to the Party's policies and, in combination with the specific local conditions, formulate implementation plans. In 1959, just after "White Dew," the higher authorities called for seizing the season to quickly plant wheat. Under normal circumstances, this was correct. As the agricultural proverb says: "Early White Dew, late Cold Dew, Autumn Equinox is the right time to plant wheat." However, this village is located north of Wenfeng Mountain, which blocks the north wind. Every year until "Cold Dew," the temperature here is still very high, and it is not appropriate to plant wheat too early. Based on the local soil quality, temperature conditions, and years of experience, they believed that it was appropriate to sow four or five days after "Cold Dew." In this situation, they studied with the masses and decided to first sow "old soil" (a type of soil that emerges later) in the north of the village, and when the season arrived, they concentrated their efforts to attack the river bank land, resulting in good growth of wheat in both places.

	The Shao family's three brothers are very concerned about collective property, always pay attention to thrift and careful calculation, and never easily spend a penny of the team's money. To this day, the team still uses the old cowshed as an office, and when the production tools are broken, they repair them themselves. Therefore, everyone supports them as stewards, and they have not been replaced for eighteen years.

	Leading by Example in Everything

	Although the Shao family's three brothers have different divisions of labor, each person's work has its own characteristics. But no matter what they do, they always walk in front of the masses.

	As the branch secretary, Shao Liyan pays special attention to helping cadres and the masses improve their ideological awareness. He often conducts ideological education on diligence and thrift in running the cooperative to the commune members; when cadres and commune members have shortcomings, he patiently persuades them and never puts on airs. Liu Qinglin's wife in this village, who is in her thirties, is not active enough in labor. Shao Liyan said to her: "The work is everyone's, it must be done by everyone. If one person doesn't go, two people don't go, and everyone doesn't do it, there won't be grain in the fields. What will us farmers eat?" After Shao Liyan's patient help, she gradually became active. This year she did more work than any other year, which made her family happy and the team happy. Shao Liyan often said to the cadres: "People are reasonable, if they do something wrong, we cadres can't get angry, we must patiently help them. Words are the keys to happiness, wouldn't it be good to say a few more heartfelt words!"

	Team leader Shao Lixin, although he is over sixty years old, has been working with the commune members. Last year, just after the lunar new year, the team was building wells along the river in order to strive for production initiative. It was cold at the time, and the ice on the river was half a foot thick. In order to set an example for the masses, he rolled up his trousers, regardless of the cold water, and took the lead. Seeing the elderly cadres going down, the commune members were deeply moved and rushed to jump down. Under their leadership, work efficiency greatly increased. The original plan was to build ten wells in ten days, but five wells were built in two days. According to the branch's division of labor, he is busy grasping both production and life, but last year he still did more than ninety workdays. He often says: "Whatever you do, you must know how to do it. To lead agricultural production, you must participate in agricultural production. If you are not an expert, you cannot lead production well."

	Liu Village's production is good, and the good steward recognized by the whole team—Shao Lirui—also played a big role. The things he keeps, whether it is agricultural tools, or grain, or mountain fruits, are all kept in good order. He believes that everyone's things must be cherished by everyone, and a small loss affects everyone. The wheat straw stacks he keeps are all padded at the bottom and plastered with mud at the top and roots to avoid mold and loss. During the busy farming season, he goes to the field every night to see if there are any forgotten tools. He never went to school when he was young, and when he first became a storekeeper, he had to find someone to keep accounts for everything. Later, he felt that this was both time-consuming and wasteful of manpower, so he worked hard to learn. After two years of learning, he can now keep simple accounts. We looked through the small account book he carried with him, and there was a line that read: "Qingming chestnuts one jin, Jing Shan's witness." After he explained, we learned that for all the fruit accounts he kept, there were not only numbers, but also witnesses.

	Cultivating Successors

	The Shao family's three brothers not only work diligently and conscientiously themselves, but also pay great attention to cultivating successors. The number of Party members in this village has grown from five to fourteen, and the number of Communist Youth League members has grown to sixteen. A new group of cadres has grown up. The village's seven junior high school students and fourteen senior elementary school graduates are all new shock troops on the agricultural front. For these successors, the Shao family's three brothers, on the one hand, use their own practical struggles to conduct revolutionary traditional education to them, and on the other hand, assign them specific tasks, cultivating and training them in actual struggles. Like Zhao Erxin, the deputy secretary of the branch, he often takes the Shao brothers as examples. He remembers what Shao Liyan and Shao Lixin often told him: as long as it is a matter that is beneficial to the masses, resolutely do it, and be sure to do it well. Therefore, since he also served as the director of the public canteen, he moved his bedding to the canteen, determined to be a good servant of the people, and was meticulous in his calculations, saving food and planning its use, so that everyone could eat both fully and well. Under the influence of the Shao brothers, the cadres of this team take the lead in everything, and consult with the commune members when handling affairs. Commune member Li Zhelan said: "The cadres of our team are of one mind with us, and they have thought of the commune members in terms of eating, clothing, and housing, just like a good mother-in-law cares for her daughter-in-law." The unity of cadres and masses, with one heart and one mind, has produced tremendous power. Therefore, the various tasks of this team have always been at the forefront of the entire commune, and it has been praised by the Linyi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party as a star of the Wenfeng People's Commune.

    邵家三兄弟
    在山东苍山县文峰公社刘村生产队，有三个受社员爱戴的好干部——支部书记邵立言，生产队长邵立欣，保管员邵立瑞。在工作中，他们按党的政策办事，倾听群众意见，关心群众生活，贯彻了实事求是，艰苦奋斗的作风。这些是邵家三兄弟领导群众生产的突出特点，也是公社化以后他们领导和组织群众生活的突出特点。
    领导群众奋战灾害
    刘村生产队（基本核算单位）有一百一十四户，五百四十二口人，每人才合九分多地。今年种植的五百多亩庄稼，都是经过和各种自然灾害严重斗争后，才有了好收成。春天，麦子正在拔节，二百三十一亩小麦，有一百五十多亩遭了红蜘蛛的虫害。邵立言傍晚从省里开会回来发现后，一夜没睡好觉，盘算着如何快些把虫害消灭。第二天一早，他就召集干部开会，商讨灭虫办法。他们带领全村能劳动的三百多人，用喷雾器、小罐、砂壶喷、浇六六六药粉，奋战两天半，基本上普治了一遍。十多天后，麦子很快长起来了。加上以后的细心管理，麦子仍然有了好收成。
    麦收后，烈日高照，二十多天没有下雨。原打算麦茬地全种豆子，因地干、费工种不上。有些靠天吃饭的人，想等待下雨后种豆子，邵家兄弟却主张抗旱压甘薯。他们根据多年经验，知道旱天压甘薯扎根浅、长圆瓜、出粉多。但是土地干硬，在犁甘薯沟时坏了四张犁铧，有的人又不想干了，仍然想等下雨。邵家兄弟认为：不耕不行，种庄稼要抢季节，早一天，是一天，等下雨，没有个准。大多数社员同意邵家兄弟的意见，就一边耕地穿沟、培垅，一边担水压甘薯。经过十多天的努力，抢压了九十亩甘薯。压上以后，为了不使甘薯受旱，他们又同社员一道，一天两次挑水浇，苗子很快长好了。
    7月间，又是二十多天连阴雨。高粱地里积水膝盖深，玉米地里水有腰深。邵立言和邵立欣，便带领一百多男女整半劳力，冒雨挖了两条三尺深、三尺宽的排水沟。水大，排不完，玉米、谷子淹了三十三亩。一看，季节不晚，还能种，他们又和群众商量，就翻掉受淹的作物，种上绿豆。可是雨仍然下个不停，种的绿豆，有些又淹了。怎么办？他们没有泄气：“淹掉绿豆，再种胡萝卜；有种就有收，比不种强。”他们继续发动群众，鼓舞斗志，少数信心不高的人，也振作了起来。大家齐心协力，又翻掉受淹的部分绿豆，种上胡萝卜。结果胡萝卜亩产一千多斤，绿豆亩产九十多斤，使重灾变成了轻灾。
    艰苦奋斗十八年
    邵家三兄弟，不仅今年领导群众战胜了严重的自然灾害，十八年来，他们在党的领导下，一直是这个村里群众的带路人。解放前，刘村才七、八十户，逃荒要饭的就有二十家，人们缺吃少穿。1957年以前，这个村每年总要国家供应几万斤粮食；大跃进以来，它由历来的缺粮村变成余粮村。1958年亩产五百斤，1959年又增加到六百零三斤，比战前最高年产量增加了一倍。
    邵立瑞六十五岁，是抗日战争时期的老模范；邵立欣六十岁，初级社就当社长；邵立言五十五岁，是抗日战争时期的村干部。他们都当过武工队员，参加过对敌斗争。今年，他们的年龄加在一起，正好一百八十岁，所以，这个村子的一些青年人，有时也热情地称他们为“一百八”。在各项工作中，他们总是按党的政策办事，并结合当地具体情况，订出执行计划。1959年，“白露”刚过，上级号召抢季节快种麦。在一般情况下，这样做是对的。农谚道：“白露早，寒露迟，秋分种麦正适时。”可是这个村北靠文峰山，挡住了北风，每年到“寒露”，这里的气温仍然很高，不宜种麦过早。他们根据当地土质、气温条件和历年经验，认为过“寒露”四、五天播种才适时。在这种情况下，他们就和群众一起研究，确定先耩村北“老土”（一种出苗较晚的土），待季节一到，就集中力量突击河崖地，结果两下小麦都生长很好。
    邵家三兄弟，对集体财产都十分关心，事事注意勤俭，精打细算，从来不轻易花掉队里一文钱。至今，队里还是利用旧牛棚作办公室，生产工具坏了，他们就自己动手修理。因此，大家都拥护他们当管家人，十八年来就没有换过。
    事事带头干
    邵家三兄弟虽然分工不同，每个人的工作都有各自的特点。但无论做什么事情，都走在群众前面。
    作为支部书记，邵立言特别注意帮助干部、群众提高思想觉悟，他经常向社员进行勤俭办社的思想教育；干部、社员有了缺点，他都是耐心说服，从不耍态度。这个村刘庆林的爱人，三十多岁，劳动不够积极。邵立言就对她说：“活是大家的，得大家做，一个不去，两个不去，大家都不干，地里不打粮食，咱庄户人凭什么吃饭？”经过邵立言的耐心帮助，她逐渐积极起来。今年她做的活比哪年都多，家里高兴，队里也高兴。邵立言常对干部说：“人都是讲理的，做错了事，咱们当干部的，不能吹胡子瞪眼，要耐心地帮助。话是开心的钥匙，多说两句贴心话不就好了嘛！”
    队长邵立欣，虽说六十多岁了，但一直跟社员们一道干活。去年刚过阴历年，队里为了力争生产主动，就在河沿砌井。当时天冷，河上的冰足有半尺厚。为了给群众树立榜样，他不顾水冷，就和邵立言卷卷裤子，带头干了起来。社员们看着年老的干部都下去了，深受感动，便抢着跳下去。在他俩的带动下，工效大大提高。本来打算十天砌十眼井，结果两天就砌好五眼。按支部分工，他既抓生产，又抓生活，是够忙的了，可是去年一年还做了九十多个工。他常说：“干什么都得会什么，领导农业生产就得参加农业生产。不当行家，是领导不好生产的。”
    刘村生产搞得好，被全队公认的好管家——邵立瑞，也起了很大的作用。他保管的东西，不管是农具，或者是粮食、山果，都管得井井有条。他认为大家的东西得大家爱护，损失一点，人人有份。他保管的麦穰垛，都是垫好底，泥好垛顶、垛根，避免了霉烂损失。农忙时，他每天晚上都到场里转转，看看有没有忘掉的工具。他从小没进过学校门，刚当保管，样样都得找人记账。后来，他觉得这样既耽误事，又浪费人力，就苦学苦练。经过两年来的学习，现在，已会记简单的账了。我们翻阅了他身上携带的小账本，有一行写着：“庆明栗子一斤，京山之见”，经他解释，我们才知道：凡他记的果品账，不仅有数字，还有见证人。
    培养接班人
    邵家三兄弟不仅自己勤勤恳恳地工作，还十分注意培养接班人。这个村的党员已由五人发展到十四人，共青团员已发展到十六人。一批新的干部已经成长起来。这个村的七名初中生和十四名高小毕业生，都是农业战线上新的突击手。对这些接班人，邵家三兄弟一方面通过自己的实际斗争，向他们进行革命传统教育，一方面交给他们具体工作，在实际斗争中培养、锻炼。像支部副书记赵尔新，就经常以邵家兄弟为榜样。他记住邵立言、邵立欣经常告诉他的话：只要对群众有利的事，就坚决办，而且一定把它办好。因此，他自兼任公共食堂主任以来，就把铺盖搬到食堂，下定决心当好人民的勤务员，处处精打细算，节约用粮、计划用粮，使大家吃得又饱又好。这个队的干部在邵家兄弟的影响下，事事带头，办事情和社员有商有议。社员李则兰说：“俺队的干部和俺一个心眼，吃的、穿的、住的，都想到了社员，真像好婆婆关心儿媳妇一样。”干部群众一致，同心同德，产生了巨大的力量。因而这个队的各项工作一直走在全公社的前面，被中共临沂地委誉为文峰人民公社的一颗明星。（附图片）
