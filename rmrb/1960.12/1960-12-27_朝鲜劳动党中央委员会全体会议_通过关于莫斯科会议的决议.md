Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 25th: Pyongyang newspapers published on the 24th the resolution of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea on the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties.

The resolution said that the declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties is a powerful revolutionary weapon for the working class and progressive people of the world in their struggle for victory, and a common program of struggle and guide to action for Communist and Workers' Parties in all countries. The documents adopted at this meeting infinitely inspire the working class and hundreds of millions of people throughout the world who aspire to peace, national independence, and social progress to strive for new victories, and deal a heavy blow to the imperialists and their running dogs, the revisionists.

The resolution said that the Workers' Party of Korea warmly welcomes and fully supports the meeting's declaration and appeal to the people of the world, and will wage a resolute struggle to implement the tasks set forth in the meeting's documents.

The resolution said that, as the declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties correctly emphasized, the development of the current international situation is decisively favorable to the people's struggle for peace, national independence, and socialism.

The world socialist system is becoming a decisive factor in the development of human society and is having an increasingly greater impact on changes in the international situation.

The strengthening and development of the socialist system has promoted the vigorous upsurge of the national liberation movement and the disintegration of the imperialist colonial system. The face of Asia has undergone fundamental changes, the liberation struggle is rising higher and higher on the African continent and in Latin America, and colonialists are encountering strong resistance struggles from oppressed people everywhere.

An important lesson of the liberation struggle of the people of colonial and dependent countries is that imperialists will never bestow freedom on colonial people, and people can only achieve liberation and independence through a tenacious struggle against imperialism. Oppressed people will rely on their own revolutionary struggle to eliminate the colonial slavery system and achieve complete victory.

The growth of socialist forces and the upsurge of the colonial national liberation movement have decisively weakened the imperialist forces. The internal contradictions of imperialism are becoming increasingly acute, and the contradictions between imperialist powers are intensifying. The working class and the broad masses of the people are waging a more tenacious struggle to win their rights to life, democracy, and social progress. Imperialism is declining and disintegrating.

The complete victory of socialism and the final demise of imperialism are inevitable. However, imperialism will not automatically withdraw from the stage of history. Imperialism still exists as a dangerous force and is carrying out malicious conspiracies to save itself from its doomed fate.

The head of the imperialist forces is US imperialism. US imperialism is the largest international exploiter, the chief culprit of world reaction, the international gendarme, the main stronghold of modern colonialism, and the enemy of people all over the world. Thoroughly exposing the aggressive policies of imperialism, especially US imperialism, is of extremely important significance in making people recognize the true face of the enemy, strengthening their will to fight, and mobilizing the broad masses to participate in the anti-imperialist struggle. The current situation requires further strengthening the struggle against imperialism headed by the United States, further strengthening the struggle for national independence, democracy, and socialism, and urgently requires further uniting all revolutionary forces in this struggle.

The resolution said that the Workers' Party of Korea has always regarded the Korean revolution as an indivisible part of the international revolutionary movement, and believes that struggling first for the victory of the Korean revolution is the way to contribute to enhancing the power of the socialist camp and the victory of the cause of the international working class.

Under the long-tested leadership of its party, the Korean people have overcome numerous difficulties and tests and have made great achievements in socialist revolution and socialist construction, faithfully fulfilling their international obligations.

In the future, our party and people will also maximize the internal strength of the country and strengthen mutual cooperation with fraternal socialist countries, thereby further promoting socialist construction in the northern half of the Republic.

The resolution said that the Workers' Party of Korea and the Korean people have always regarded supporting the national liberation struggle of oppressed people against imperialism and strengthening support for the revolutionary struggle of the working class and the masses of the people in capitalist countries as their sacred internationalist duty. We resolutely support the struggle of the heroic Cuban people to defend the fruits of the revolution and strive for social progress, and resolutely oppose the US imperialists' aggressive conspiracy against Cuba. We actively support the Japanese people's struggle against US imperialism's rule and the revival of militarism, and for peace, democracy, and national independence. We support the Lao people's struggle to defend national independence and resolutely condemn US imperialists' armed intervention in Laos. We extend warm support to the Algerian people who are waging a just war of liberation and support the national liberation struggles of the Congolese people and all African people.

The resolution said that the Korean people will always stand firmly on the side of the people of all countries who are fighting against imperialism and for national independence, democracy, and socialism.

The resolution, in discussing the issue of defending world peace, said that today, the main force of aggression and war on the international stage is US imperialism. Various facts prove that the aggressive nature of imperialism will not change, and as long as imperialism exists, there will be soil for aggressive war. The danger of a new world war has not passed, and people of all countries must be particularly vigilant at all times and must wage a resolute struggle against the imperialists' conspiracy to launch war.

Today, socialist and peaceful forces on the international stage are overwhelming the imperialist war forces. The fundamental change in the balance of world forces has created the possibility of preventing a new world war. But peace will not come on its own; it must be won through struggle. Only by continuously strengthening the power of the socialist camp, developing the workers' movement in capitalist countries, igniting the flames of national liberation struggle more fiercely, organizing and mobilizing the broad masses of the people to participate in the struggle to defend peace, uniting all peace forces, coordinating various forms and methods of struggle, and putting pressure on and striking blows at the imperialist war instigators everywhere can we prevent war and defend peace.

Now, the tenacious revolutionary struggles of the people unfolding around the world against imperialist aggression and exploitation are dealing serious blows to the imperialists' war policies.

Socialist countries, which are peace-loving in essence, have consistently struggled against war. The Soviet Union and all socialist countries follow a foreign policy of peaceful coexistence and have made great contributions to easing international tensions and maintaining and consolidating peace.

The struggle to realize the Soviet Union's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament is of great significance to the cause of peace, and we should struggle for the prohibition of the testing and production of nuclear weapons, the dissolution of military blocs, the elimination of military bases on foreign territories, the withdrawal of foreign troops, and the reduction of armed forces and armaments. Imperialists are unwilling to coexist peacefully with socialist countries, nor will they automatically lay down their arms. The people must use their own tenacious struggle to stop the arms race and war-provoking policies carried out by the imperialists and must bankrupt them.

The resolution, after condemning US imperialism's occupation of South Korea and its military provocations, pointed out that we must maintain maximum vigilance, keenly watch the enemy's every move, and be constantly prepared materially and spiritually to defeat all the enemy's provocations.

Making the US troops withdraw from South Korea is the basic condition for eliminating the danger of war in Korea and ensuring solid peace. All the Korean people will wage a more tenacious struggle to drive the US imperialist aggressor troops out of our motherland's territory. Our party and our people will continue to advance holding high the banner of peace, steadfastly guarding the eastern outpost of peace and socialism.

The resolution said that in order to safeguard world peace and oppose the aggressive and war policies of the imperialists headed by US imperialism, all peace forces must establish a broad united front.

The resolution strongly condemned the revival of Japanese militarism and the aggressive US-Japan military treaty, which have become the main sources of war in Asia, and expressed its determination to struggle against all this.

The resolution said that the unity of the socialist camp and the solidarity of the international communist movement are the most powerful guarantees for winning victory in the struggle for peace, democracy, national independence, and socialism. The mutual relations between socialist camp countries and between Communist and Workers' Parties in various countries are based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism.

All Communist and Workers' Parties are completely equal and independent, and they independently decide their own lines and policies.

Communist and Workers' Parties reach consensus and take concerted action in the struggle for common goals through consultation. The interests of the working class require each Communist and Workers' Party to consistently abide by the assessments and conclusions jointly made by the fraternal parties at the meeting. Strengthening unity, helping each other, and cooperating closely are the highest internationalist duties of socialist camp countries and all fraternal parties.

The resolution said that the Workers' Party of Korea has always consistently strived to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp and the solidarity of the international communist movement.

Our party will make every effort to further strengthen the unity with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the friendship between the peoples of Korea and the Soviet Union.

Our party will make further efforts to develop the friendship between the peoples of Korea and China, forged in the long-term common struggle against imperialism, and to strengthen the solidarity with the Communist Party of China.

We will closely unite and advance together with the parties and peoples of all socialist camp countries, and we will unite with all fraternal parties to resolutely defend the unity of the international communist movement.

The resolution said that in order to develop the communist movement, it is necessary to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism and further strengthen the struggle on two fronts—against revisionism and against dogmatism and sectarianism.

Revisionism, as a reflection of bourgeois ideology, remains the main danger in the international workers' movement. Modern revisionists, headed by the Yugoslav revisionists, say that Marxism-Leninism is outdated, emasculate its revolutionary spirit, beautify imperialism in every way, and are engaged in activities that undermine the socialist camp and the international communist movement.

Revisionism paralyzes the revolutionary will of the working class, disintegrates the party from within, and disarms and relaxes the vigilance of the working class and the working masses in the struggle for peace, national independence, and social progress.

As in the past, our party will continue to wage a resolute struggle to resolutely defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism and to oppose revisionism and right-wing opportunism.

We must educate all party members and working people not to harbor any illusions about imperialist aggressors, decisively oppose corruption and complacency, hate the enemies of the revolution, and wage an uncompromising struggle against them.

We must wage a struggle against all bourgeois ideologies and continue to strengthen communist education among party members and working people.

The resolution finally called on all party organizations of the Workers' Party to widely explain and publicize the achievements of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties and the content of the meeting's documents to all party members and working people, and to hold high the ever-victorious banner of Marxism-Leninism, unite more closely around the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, and advance bravely for socialist construction and the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

    朝鲜劳动党中央委员会全体会议
    通过关于莫斯科会议的决议
    新华社平壤25日电　平壤各报24日刊载了朝鲜劳动党中央委员会全体会议关于各国共产党和工人党代表会议的决议。
    决议说，各国共产党和工人党代表会议的声明是全世界工人阶级和进步的人民在争取胜利的斗争中的强有力的革命的武器，是世界各国共产党和工人党的共同的斗争纲领和行动指南。这次会议通过的文献，无限地鼓舞着向往和平、民族独立和社会进步的全世界工人阶级和亿万人民去争取新的胜利，沉重地打击了帝国主义者及其走狗修正主义者。
    决议说，朝鲜劳动党热烈欢迎和完全支持会议声明和告世界人民书，并将为了实现这次会议的文献中所提出的各项任务进行坚决的斗争。
    决议说，正如各国共产党和工人党代表会议声明正确强调的一样，当前的国际局势的发展决定性地有利于为争取和平、民族独立和社会主义而斗争的人民。
    世界社会主义体系正在成为人类社会发展的决定性因素，对国际局势的变化发生着越来越大的影响。
    社会主义体系的加强和发展促进了民族解放运动强有力的高涨和帝国主义殖民地体系的瓦解过程。亚洲的面貌发生了根本变化，在非洲大陆和拉丁美洲解放斗争越来越高涨，殖民主义者在所有的地方都遇到了被压迫人民的强有力的反抗斗争。
    殖民地附属国人民的解放斗争的重要教训是：帝国主义者绝不会把自由恩赐给殖民地人民，而人民只有通过同帝国主义的顽强斗争才能取得解放和独立。被压迫人民将依靠自己的革命斗争消灭殖民主义奴役制度，取得完全的胜利。
    社会主义力量的增长和殖民地民族解放运动的高涨，决定性地削弱了帝国主义势力。帝国主义的内部矛盾越来越尖锐化，帝国主义列强间矛盾正在加剧。工人阶级和广大人民群众为争取自己的生活权利、民主和社会进步而进行着更加顽强的斗争。帝国主义正在衰落和瓦解。
    社会主义的完全胜利和帝国主义的最后灭亡是必不可免的。然而，帝国主义是不会自动退出历史舞台的。帝国主义仍然作为危险的势力存在着，并为挽救自己灭亡的命运而进行着恶毒的阴谋活动。
    帝国主义势力的头子是美帝国主义。美帝国主义是最大的国际剥削者，是世界反动的元凶，是国际宪兵，是现代殖民主义的主要堡垒，是全世界人民的敌人。彻底揭露帝国主义特别是美帝国主义的侵略政策，在使人民认清敌人的真面目、加强他们的斗争的意志、动员广大群众参加反帝斗争方面，具有极其重要的意义。当前的局势要求更加加强反对以美国为首的帝国主义，更加加强争取民族独立、民主和社会主义的斗争，并迫切地要求在这一斗争中进一步地把一切革命力量团结起来。
    决议说，朝鲜劳动党一向把朝鲜革命看成是国际革命运动的不可分割的组成部分，并认为首先为朝鲜革命的胜利而斗争才是对增强社会主义阵营的威力和国际工人阶级事业的胜利作出贡献的道路。
    朝鲜人民在自己党的久经考验的领导下，战胜重重的困难和考验，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得了巨大的成就，忠实地履行了自己国际义务。
    我们党和人民今后也将最大限度地动员国家的内部力量，加强同兄弟般的各社会主义国家的互相合作，从而进一步促进共和国北半部的社会主义建设。
    决议说，朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜人民一向认为支持被压迫人民反对帝国主义的民族解放斗争、加强对资本主义国家工人阶级和人民群众的革命斗争的支持是自己的神圣的国际主义义务。我们坚决支持英勇的古巴人民为保卫革命果实和争取社会进步而进行的斗争，坚决反对美帝国主义者对古巴的侵略阴谋。我们积极支持日本人民反对美帝国主义的统治和军国主义的复活、争取和平、民主和民族独立的斗争。我们支持老挝人民保卫民族独立的斗争，坚决谴责美帝国主义者对老挝的武装干涉。我们向正在进行正义的解放战争的阿尔及利亚人民致以热烈的声援，支持刚果人民和一切非洲人民的民族解放斗争。
    决议说，朝鲜人民将永远坚定地站在反对帝国主义和为民族独立、民主和社会主义而斗争的各国人民的一边。
    决议在谈到保卫世界和平的问题时说，今天，国际舞台上的侵略和战争的主要力量是美帝国主义。各种事实证明，帝国主义的侵略本性是不会改变的，只要帝国主义还存在，就存在着侵略战争的土壤。新的世界大战的危险还没有过去，各国人民比任何时候都要特别高的警惕，必须进行坚决的斗争，反对帝国主义者发动战争的阴谋。
    今天，国际舞台上的社会主义和和平力量正在压倒帝国主义战争势力。由于世界力量对比的根本变化造成了能够防止新的世界大战的可能性。但是和平不会自己到来，必须用斗争去争取。只有不断加强社会主义阵营的威力，发展资本主义国家的工人运动，更高地燃起民族解放斗争的火焰，组织和动员广大的人民群众参加保卫和平的斗争，团结一切和平力量，配合各种斗争形式和方法，到处给帝国主义战争挑拨者以压力和打击，才能防止战争保卫住和平。
    现在，在世界各地为反对帝国主义的侵略和剥削而展开的人民的顽强的革命斗争，给帝国主义者的战争政策以严重的打击。
    社会主义各国，从本质上爱好和平，始终一贯地为反对战争而进行斗争。苏联和所有社会主义国家遵循和平共处的对外政策，为缓和国际紧张局势维护和巩固和平而作出巨大贡献。
    为实现苏联提出的全面彻底的裁军计划而进行的斗争对和平事业具有巨大意义，应该为禁止试验和生产核武器，解散军事集团，取消设在别国领土上的军事基地，撤退外国军队，裁减武装部队和军备而进行斗争。帝国主义者是不肯同社会主义国家和平共处的，也不会自动放下武器的。人民必须以自己的顽强的斗争，来制止帝国主义者所进行的军备竞赛和战争挑拨政策，必须使其破产。
    决议在谴责美帝国主义的强占南朝鲜及其军事挑衅行动后指出，我们必须保持最大的警惕性，锐敏地注视敌人的一举一动，在物质上和精神上经常处于戒备状态，以击败敌人的一切挑衅行动。
    使美国军队从南朝鲜撤走，这是在朝鲜消除战争危险保障巩固的和平的基本条件。全体朝鲜人民将为从我们祖国领土赶走美帝侵略军队而进行更加顽强的斗争。我党和我国人民高举和平的旗帜继续前进，坚守和平和社会主义的东方前哨。
    决议说，为了维护世界和平，反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义者的侵略政策和战争政策，一切和平力量必须建立广泛的统一战线。
    决议强烈地谴责成为亚洲的主要战争根源的日本军国主义的复活和侵略性的日美军事条约，并表示要为反对这一切而进行斗争。
    决议说，社会主义阵营的统一和国际共产主义运动的团结，是争取和平、民主、民族独立和社会主义的斗争取得胜利的最有力的保证。社会主义阵营各国和各国共产党、工人党的相互关系是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上的。
    所有共产党和工人党都是完全平等的、独立的，它们独自决定自己的路线和政策。
    共产党和工人党在为了共同目标的斗争中用协商的方法取得一致的见解，采取一致的行动。工人阶级的利益，要求每个共产党和工人党一致遵守各兄弟党在会议上共同作出的估计和结论。加强团结、互相帮助、紧密合作，是社会主义阵营各国和所有兄弟党的最高的国际主义义务。
    决议说，朝鲜劳动党始终一贯地为加强社会主义阵营的统一和国际共产主义运动的团结而努力。
    我们党将为进一步加强同苏联共产党的团结和朝苏两国人民的友谊而尽一切努力。
    我们党将为发展在反对帝国主义的长期的共同斗争中结成的朝中两国人民的友谊，为加强同中国共产党的团结而作进一步的努力。
    我们将同所有社会主义阵营国家的党和人民紧密团结，一同前进，并同所有的兄弟党团结起来坚决保卫国际共产主义运动的统一。
    决议说，为了共产主义运动的发展，必须保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，进一步加强两条战线上的斗争——反对修正主义、反对教条主义和宗派主义。
    作为资产阶级思想反映的修正主义，仍然是国际工人运动中的主要危险。以南斯拉夫修正主义者为首的现代修正主义说马克思列宁主义已经过时，阉割其革命精神，从各方面美化帝国主义，进行着破坏社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的活动。
    修正主义麻痹工人阶级的革命意志，从内部瓦解党，使工人阶级劳动群众在争取和平、民族独立和社会进步的斗争中解除武装，放松警惕。
    我们党如同过去一样，今后也将为坚决保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，继续反对修正主义和右倾机会主义而进行坚决的斗争。
    我们要教育全体党员和劳动人民，对帝国主义侵略者不抱任何幻想，决定性地反对腐化、安逸的现象，仇恨革命的敌人并同它们进行不妥协的斗争。
    我们必须进行反对一切资产阶级思想的斗争，继续在党员和劳动人民中加强共产主义教育。
    决议最后号召劳动党的所有党组织要向全体党员和劳动人民广泛地解释和宣传这次各国共产党和工人党代表会议成就和会议文件的内容，并且高举百战百胜的马克思列宁主义旗帜，更紧密地团结在以金日成同志为首的党中央委员会周围，为了社会主义建设和祖国的和平统一奋勇前进。
