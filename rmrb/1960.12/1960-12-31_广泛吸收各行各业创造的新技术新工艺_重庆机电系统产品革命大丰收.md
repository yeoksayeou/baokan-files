    Extensive Absorption of New Technologies and Techniques Created by All Sectors
    Chongqing's Mechanical and Electrical System Achieves a Bumper Harvest in Product Revolution
    (Reported by this newspaper) According to Chongqing Daily, the factories under the Chongqing Municipal Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Industry have reformed more than 60% of their products and successfully trial-produced more than 200 important new products during the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Through product revolution, not only the quality and technical level of the city's machinery industry have been improved, but also the potential of raw materials and labor has been tapped. The raw materials saved by the bureau are equivalent to the total consumption of all factories for one month, and the labor saved is equivalent to the labor of 3,000 people for one year.
    In the process of vigorously carrying out product revolution, the city's machinery industry has widely absorbed various new technologies, new techniques, and new experiences created by all sectors in the technical revolution movement, thus ensuring that many products become better and better in the reform. For example, in improving the design of Roots blowers, which have been used for many years at home and abroad, the General Machinery Factory absorbed the experience of "small-scale foreign technology groups" in the province's iron and steel industry in using multiple blowers in parallel and created a new type of blower with the advantages of both Roots and vane blowers.
    The wide application of new technologies, new techniques, and new materials (including substitute materials) in product design has made many products lighter, smaller, simpler, and greatly saved man-hours and raw materials. For example, the successful testing of new casting technologies has led to the design of a non-cutting machining winch, reducing product parts by more than 80% and machine weight by more than half. After the modification of 186 types (including specifications) of electrical switches, the average saving in labor is more than 45%, and the saving in raw materials is more than 40%. Boilers, steam engines, air compressors, condensate pumps, and other products have been reformed to increase capacity, improve output, and save materials and man-hours.
    In order to adapt to the new imbalances in some types of work and processes after the reduction of parts and components following product reform, and based on the favorable conditions of increased standardization, generalization, and batch size of parts and components after product reform, many factories have improved production organization and labor organization, established various forms of production lines, and rationally organized the closed production of specialized products or parts and components, so that the achievements of product revolution have been continuously consolidated and improved, and greater practical results have been achieved in production. After organizing the closed production of the modified six-cubic-meter air compressor, the Chongqing Water Turbine Factory not only consolidated the achievements of the product revolution, but also enabled workers to fully grasp and understand the structure and performance of the product, which is more conducive to mobilizing the masses of workers to carry out product design and process reform.

    广泛吸收各行各业创造的新技术新工艺
    重庆机电系统产品革命大丰收
    本报讯　据重庆日报消息：重庆市机电局所属各厂在技术革新和技术革命运动中，改革了60％以上的产品，并试制成功二百多种重要新产品。通过产品革命，不仅提高了全市机械工业的产品质量和技术水平，并且挖掘了原材料和劳动力的潜力，全局节约的原材料相当于各厂一个月耗用量的总和，节约的劳动力相当于三千人一年的劳动。
    这个市机械工业在大搞产品革命中，广泛吸取了各行各业在技术革命运动中创造的各种新工艺、新技术和新经验，因而保证了许多产品在改革中越改越好。如通用机器厂在改进国内外沿用多年的罗茨鼓风机设计中，吸取了全省钢铁“小洋群”企业运用多种风机并联的经验，创造出具有罗茨式和叶式两种鼓风机优点的新型鼓风机。
    在产品设计中广泛采用新技术、新工艺、新材料（包括代用材料）以后，使许多产品重的变轻，大的变小，复杂的变简单，并大大节约了工时和原材料。如铸造新技术的试验成功，出现了无切削加工卷扬机的设计，使产品零件减少80％以上，机器重量减轻一半多。一百八十六种（包括规格）电器开关改型后，平均节约劳动力45％以上，节约原材料40％以上。锅炉、蒸汽机、空气压缩机、冷凝泵等产品，经过改革后，增大了容量，提高了出力，节约了材料、工时。
    为了适应产品改革后零件部件减少，部分工种、工序出现的新的不平衡，以及根据产品改革后零件部件标准化、通用化程度的提高和批量增大的有利条件，许多工厂改善了生产组织工作和劳动组织，建立了多种形式的生产流水线，合理组织了专业产品或零件、部件的封闭式生产，使产品革命成果得到了不断地巩固和提高，在生产上发挥了更大的实效。重庆水轮机厂把改型后的六立方米空气压缩机组织封闭式生产以后，不仅使产品革命的成果得到巩固，同时还使工人能够全面掌握和了解产品的结构、性能，这就更有利于发动工人群众进行产品设计和工艺的改革。
