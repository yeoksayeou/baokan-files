Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing - Jiangsu Province's late-season cotton picking and sales work has rapidly unfolded. From December 1st to 6th, the average daily cotton sales to the state were three and a half times higher than in late November.

Recently, the weather has turned sunny. In order to promptly pick and sell the cotton in the fields, on the stalks, and in the commune and team storage, various localities have further strengthened specific leadership over cotton purchasing work, launching a "four quicks" movement of quick picking, quick drying, quick sorting, and quick selling. The Yancheng Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party mobilized 1,400 cadres in late November, led by responsible cadres of the prefectural committee, to go deep into the production teams to help with work and participate in cotton picking, promoting the meticulous harvesting and quick selling work of the broad masses of commune members. Qidong County rationally arranged labor. In the four days from December 1st to 4th alone, it mobilized more than 60,000 people to continuously carry out a concentrated effort to pick and sell cotton, selling 3,871 dan of ginned cotton to the state. In order to pick all the flowering cotton bolls, all localities paid attention to picking the cotton clean from the stalks and picking up the fallen flowers from the ground. In the Shenzao Commune of Dongtai County, twenty-five large teams mobilized nearly 9,000 people to pick cotton, collecting more than 37,000 jin of seed cotton in three days.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou - Zhejiang cotton-producing areas have universally launched a high tide of meticulous late-season cotton harvesting and sales.

This year, Zhejiang's cotton procurement progress has been faster than in previous years, and many regions have already completed their annual plans ahead of schedule. Recently, Party committees at all levels in the cotton-producing areas, based on the characteristics of the late-season cotton being scattered and sporadic, have further strengthened leadership to ensure that this year's cotton harvesting and purchasing work starts and finishes well, and better support industrial production. Cadres at all levels have gone deep into the front lines, working and discussing with commune members, and mobilizing commune members to further improve cotton harvesting work through block-by-block appraisals, on-site meetings, and detailed accounting. In Cixi County, three Party committee secretaries of the Wudongzha Commune and more than 100 large team cadres went deep into the fields to lead commune members in persistent meticulous harvesting, picking about 300,000 jin of cotton per day.

In cotton harvesting, all localities have conscientiously implemented the Party's various policies, rationally adjusted cotton picking quotas based on the characteristics of late-season cotton picking, appropriately increased labor work points, established a bonus system for exceeding quotas, and organized competitions for meticulous cotton harvesting, more cotton harvesting, and quick cotton selling.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou - The Party committees of key cotton-producing areas in Gansu Province have strengthened ideological education among members of the people's communes regarding meticulous harvesting, careful picking, and quick selling of new cotton, greatly promoting the mass movement of cotton picking, sales, transportation, and processing.

Currently, all cotton-producing areas are concentrating labor, transportation capacity, and processing strength to carry out cotton picking, sales, and processing work. The production teams in the Xiba, Dongba, and Jinta key cotton-producing communes of Jiuquan City, according to the current agricultural work situation, have organized 138 cotton picking teams, 157 cotton selling teams, and more than 510 cotton selling vehicles, greatly enhancing the strength of cotton picking and selling. The number of people involved in cotton picking in the city has increased from more than 2,000 to more than 9,700. They have not only properly arranged the cotton picking force, but also arranged the transportation force, ensuring quick cotton picking, quick transportation, quick sales, and quick processing.

Party committees at all levels have strengthened leadership in cotton picking and sales work and conscientiously implemented policies. Many communes have implemented a method of fixing leaders, plots, time, quantity, quality, work points, and rewards in harvesting, and fixing vehicles, livestock, personnel, time, transportation volume, and rewards in transportation, significantly increasing the average daily cotton picking volume.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi - The purchasing work of livestock products in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has progressed rapidly. By the end of November, more than ten kinds of livestock products, such as cashmere, horse mane, horse tail, cowhide, horsehide, lambskin, and various wild furs, have exceeded the annual purchase targets.

Party committees at all levels in the autonomous region attach great importance to the purchase of livestock products, comprehensively arranging labor and transportation capacity to ensure that agricultural production is not affected and that all livestock products are completed in one go during the peak purchase season.

This year, livestock product purchasing departments in various localities have dispatched a large number of personnel to various communes to pre-purchase livestock products. While signing pre-purchase contracts, they repeatedly publicized the state's purchasing policies, and adopted the method of signing agreements on a commune basis and signing specific contracts on a production team basis, implementing the purchase plan at all levels. In order to promote production and facilitate the sale of livestock products by commune members, various localities have also issued advance deposits in a timely manner to help communes and production teams formulate production plans.

    江苏浙江积极采摘交售后期棉花
    甘肃重点产棉区各人民公社细摘快售新棉
    新疆十多种畜产品超额完成全年收购任务
    据新华社南京电　江苏省后期棉花采摘交售工作迅速展开，12月1日至6日平均每日向国家交售的棉花比11月下旬高出三倍半。
    近来天气转晴，为把田里、秸上和社队库存的棉花及时采摘和整晒出售，各地进一步加强了对购棉工作的具体领导，开展了一个快拾、快晒、快拣、快售的“四快”运动。中共盐城地委在11月下旬动员了一千四百名干部，由地委负责干部带领深入生产队帮助工作，并参加拾花，推动了广大社员精收细摘、快拾快售工作。启东县合理安排了劳力，仅1日至4日的四天中，就发动了六万多人，连续突击采摘交售棉花，出售给国家的皮棉达三千八百七十一担。为使开花的棉桃全部摘下来，各地都注意把株上棉花摘净、地上落花拾净。东台县沈灶公社二十五个大队，动员近九千多人拾棉，三天就拾到籽棉三万七千多斤。
    据新华社杭州电　浙江产棉区普遍掀起后期棉花细收细摘和交售热潮。
    今年浙江棉花采购进度比往年快，许多地区已经提前完成全年计划。最近以来，棉区各级党委根据后期棉花零星分散的特点，进一步加强领导，保证今年棉花采摘和收购工作善始善终，更好地支援工业生产。各级干部深入第一线，跟社员同劳动、同商量，通过逐块鉴定、召开现场会议和算细账的办法，发动社员进一步做好棉花细收细摘工作。慈溪县五洞闸公社三个党委书记和一百多个大队干部都深入田间，带领社员坚持细收，日采棉花达三十万斤左右。
    各地在棉花采摘中，都认真贯彻了党的各项政策，根据后期棉花采摘特点，合理调整了摘花定额，适当提高劳动工分，建立超额奖励制度，并组织开展细收棉、多收棉、快售棉竞赛。
    据新华社兰州电　甘肃省各重点产棉区党委加强对人民公社社员进行精收、细摘、快售新棉的思想教育，大大地推进了群众性的棉花采摘、交售、调运、加工运动。
    目前，各产棉区都集中劳力、运力和加工力量，进行棉花的采摘、交售和加工工作。酒泉市西坝、东坝、金塔等三个重点产棉公社的各生产队，按照当前农活情况，组织了一百三十八个摘棉队、一百五十七个售棉队和五百一十多辆售棉车，大大增强了摘棉、售棉力量。全市投入摘棉的人数由原来的二千多人增加到九千七百多人。他们不仅妥善安排了采摘力量，而且也安排了运输力量，保证了棉花快摘、快运、快交售、快加工。
    各地党委在棉花采摘、交售工作中都加强领导，认真贯彻政策。许多公社在收获上实行定领导、定地块、定时间、定数量、定质量、定工分、定奖励的办法，在运输上实行定车辆、定牲畜、定人员、定时间、定运量、定奖励的办法，平均每天的摘棉量显著提高。
    据新华社乌鲁木齐电　新疆维吾尔自治区畜产品收购工作进展迅速，到11月底，山羊绒、马鬃、马尾、牛皮、马皮、羊羔皮和各种野生皮张等十多种畜产品已经超额完成全年的收购任务。
    自治区各级党委对畜产品收购工作非常重视，全面安排劳力和运力，做到既不影响农业生产，又保证各项畜产品在收购旺季一气呵成。
    各地畜产品收购部门今年都抽调大批人员分赴各个公社预购畜产品。在签订预购合同的同时，反复宣传了国家的收购政策，并且采用以公社为单位签订协议，以生产队为单位签订具体合同的办法，把收购计划层层落实。为促进生产，便利社员交售畜产品，各地还适时发放了预购订金，帮助公社和生产队制定生产规划。（附图片）
