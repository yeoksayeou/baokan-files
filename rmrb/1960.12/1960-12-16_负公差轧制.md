    Rolling with Negative Tolerance

    Rolling with negative tolerance is an important measure for saving raw materials and increasing the output of finished products in the production of shaped steel. Many industrial departments have regulations for positive and negative tolerances, and any product within this range is considered qualified. Negative tolerance rolling of steel means controlling the finished product size within the negative tolerance range promulgated by the state, achieving the goal of producing more and better steel products with the same amount of steel billets and ingots. For example, the standard for round steel with a diameter of 10 mm specifies a positive tolerance of 10 to 10.4 mm and a negative tolerance of 9.5 to 10 mm. That is, finished products between 9.5 and 10.4 mm are all qualified. Assuming that one ton of steel material can be rolled into 162 meters of 10 mm round steel, rolling it entirely to the negative tolerance of 9.7 mm would yield 172 meters.

    负公差轧制
    负公差轧制，是在生产型钢中既能节约原料又能增产成品的重要措施。许多工业部门都有正公差与负公差的规定，凡在此范围内的就算是合格的产品。钢材的负公差轧制，就是把成品尺寸控制在国家颁布的负公差范围以内，达到用同样多的钢坯钢锭生产出更多更好的钢材。譬如直径十毫米的圆钢在标准中规定正公差是十至十点四毫米，负公差是九点五至十毫米。也就是轧出九点五至十点四毫米之间的成品都能合格。假定一吨钢料轧十毫米的圆钢为一百六十二米，全轧负公差九点七毫米就可轧一百七十二米。
