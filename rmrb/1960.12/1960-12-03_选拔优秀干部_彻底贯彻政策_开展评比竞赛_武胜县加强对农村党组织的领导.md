    Selecting Outstanding Cadres Thoroughly Implementing Policies Launching Emulation Drives
    Wusheng County Strengthens Leadership over Rural Party Organizations
    Xinhua News Agency News: The Wusheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the new situation after communization, has further strengthened its leadership over the work of rural branches, continuously improving the policy and leadership level of rural Party branch cadres, ensuring the serious implementation of the Party's various guidelines and policies. Over the past two years, the people of the county have worked with one heart and one mind to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, overcome various difficulties in the advance, and achieved great results. Although the county encountered drought this year, it has completed the annual national grain and oil procurement tasks ahead of schedule, on the basis of retaining sufficient rations, seeds, and fodder; the autumn sowing area has been expanded by 19.4% compared to last year.
    After communization, the thirty-four communes and three hundred and eighty-four management districts (basic accounting units) in Wusheng County established Party committees and Party branches, which have played a significant role in leading the people's communes in production and construction. In order to continuously improve the level of rural Party organizations, the Wusheng County Committee of the CPC initially focused on strengthening the leadership over the work of rural branches from the following aspects.
    First, the county committee adopted the method of "sending down" and "promoting up," transferring a group of outstanding Party member cadres from leading organs to work in the branches, and at the same time, selected more than one hundred outstanding Party members from various branches to serve as branch secretaries. These people have been tested by years of work and are firm in their positions and have advanced ideas, poor and lower-middle peasant Party members, most of whom are red flag bearers and pacesetters in production and various tasks.
    Secondly, whenever an important task is assigned, the method of "planting a pole to the bottom" is adopted, convening enlarged meetings with the participation of branch secretaries to directly explain the policies to the branches. At these meetings, the county party committee organizes branch cadres to repeatedly study the policies through reports, discussions, and other methods; and educates cadres to recognize the importance of implementing the Party's policies by comparing good and bad examples, which has played a great role in improving the policy level of Party branch cadres.
    In order to make it easier for cadres to memorize policies, the county committee also compiled some important policies into popular lectures based on the actual situation of the county and distributed them to the branches. In addition, the county also ran spare-time Party schools on a large scale to concentrate branch cadres and rural Party members in batches to study policies. In the summer of this year alone, the county Party school trained more than 5,000 people in rotation.
    Grasping the key points to drive the general is also one of the methods used by the Wusheng County Committee to strengthen the leadership of the branches. The five secretaries of the county committee have respectively established key branches in various types of regions throughout the county. After each policy of the Party is announced, they conduct pilot work in these branches, create and summarize experience, and then hold on-site meetings to promote it and promote overall work.
    The red flag competition carried out between branches and Party members is another measure taken by the Wusheng County Committee to grasp the work of the branches. Wang Dingchang, the secretary of the Satellite Management District Branch of the Old County Commune, goes deep among the masses, always sets an example and takes the lead in implementing policies, and leads the Satellite Management District to increase production year after year. The county party committee organized a campaign to learn from Wang Dingchang among the branches throughout the county, and many Wang Dingchang-style branch secretaries and cadres emerged. The red flag competition prompted the advanced to become more advanced, and the backward to catch up with the advanced, with each branch striving to be the best. At the beginning of this year, there were forty-two branches with relatively poor performance in the county. Due to the strengthened leadership of the county party committee and the launch of the red flag competition, thirty-four of them have changed their faces, and the rest have made great progress.

### 选拔优秀干部  彻底贯彻政策　开展评比竞赛  武胜县加强对农村党组织的领导

    选拔优秀干部  彻底贯彻政策　开展评比竞赛
    武胜县加强对农村党组织的领导
    新华社讯　中共四川省武胜县委根据公社化后的新情况，进一步加强对农村支部工作的领导，不断提高农村党支部干部的政策和领导水平，保证了党的各项方针、政策认真贯彻。两年多来，全县人民一条心、一股劲地大办农业、大办粮食，战胜了前进中的各种困难，取得了很大成绩。今年虽然遇到干旱，全县在留足口粮、种籽、饲料的基础上，已经提前完成全年的国家粮食、油料征购任务；秋播面积比去年扩大了19.4％。
    公社化以后，武胜县三十四个公社和三百八十四个管理区（基本核算单位）都建立了党委会和党支部，对领导各人民公社进行生产建设，起了很大作用。为了不断提高农村党组织的水平，中共武胜县委一开始就注意从以下几方面加强对农村支部工作的领导。
    县委首先采取“放下去”、“提起来”的办法，从领导机关抽调一批优秀党员干部到支部工作，同时从各支部选拔了一百多个优秀党员担任支部书记。这些人都是经过多年来工作考验，立场坚定、思想先进的贫农和下中农党员，其中绝大部分是生产和各项工作中的红旗手和标兵。
    其次，每布置一项较重要的工作时，都采取一竿子插到底的办法，召开有支部书记参加的扩大会议，把政策直接交代到支部。在这些会上，县委通过做报告、讨论等办法组织支部干部反复学习政策；并用好坏典型对比的办法教育干部认识到贯彻党的政策的重要意义，对提高党支部干部政策水平起了很大的作用。
    为了使干部便于熟记政策，县委还结合本县实际情况把一些重要政策编成通俗讲话发到支部。此外，全县还通过大办业余党校的方式，分批集中支部干部和农村党员学习政策。仅今年夏季，县党校就轮训了五千多人。
    抓住重点带动一般，也是武胜县委加强对支部领导的方法之一。县委的五位书记都分别在全县各种不同类型的地区建立了重点支部，党的每项政策公布后，他们就在这些支部进行试点工作，创造、总结经验，然后召开现场会议加以推广，推动全面工作。
    在支部和党员之间开展的红旗竞赛，是武胜县委抓支部工作的另一措施。旧县公社卫星管理区支部书记汪定昌深入群众好，处处以身作则、带头模范地执行政策，领导卫星管理区连年增产。县委在全县支部中组织开展了学汪定昌的运动，出现了许多汪定昌式的支部书记和干部。红旗竞赛促使先进更先进，后进赶先进，个个支部力争上游，今年初全县有四十二个工作较差的支部，由于县委加强领导，以及开展了红旗竞赛，现在已有三十四个改变了面貌，其余的也都有很大进步。
