    The Flying Phoenix
    Guo Ba, a woman who used to be impoverished and suffered all kinds of hardships herding livestock for the herdowners, is now, under the leadership of the Party, a strong and capable female deputy leader of a production team.
    Wei Molin, Ma Yufang, Zhao Huaiqing
    "A phoenix nesting in a chicken coop cannot spread its wings; a flying phoenix soars higher than an eagle." Guo Ba, the female deputy leader of the production team of the Suhurima Commune in Jiuzhi County, Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, is that flying phoenix.
    Having grown up on the grasslands and previously herded cattle and sheep for herdowners, living in extreme poverty, Guo Ba became the deputy leader of the Second Production Team of the commune when it was established in 1958. At first, when people called her "Captain," she was very timid, afraid to answer, her face reddening to the roots of her ears. She wondered if a woman who had been a hired hand and begged for food could lead the villagers well. At this time, the Party Branch Secretary encouraged her to believe in her own strength and to be a strong and brave female warrior. The Party's teachings added infinite confidence and strength to Guo Ba. She thought: "As long as I have the Party's support and education, as long as I am selfless and listen to the Party, there is nothing I cannot do."

    Turning the Grassland into a Land of Rice and Grain
    In the autumn of 1959, the Suhurima Commune in the pastoral area responded to the Party's call and began to develop agriculture. One evening, Guo Ba walked home excitedly. Her mother, who was cooking milk tea for her, had never seen her daughter so excited. Before she could figure out what was going on, her daughter was already sitting in front of her:
    "Mom, our pastoral area will soon be planting crops! Tomorrow morning, I'm going to the mountains to clear land!" That night, Guo Ba couldn't fall asleep for a long time. She remembered the scene more than twenty years ago when she was a child, trekking to Aba, Sichuan, to beg for food. She saw the endless sea of wheat for the first time. However, the fierce-looking strongmen standing next to the land wouldn't let her get close! She thought with resentment: No matter how rich this land is, it belongs to the landlords. She couldn't help but dream of when her hometown could also grow crops. Now, her dream of more than twenty years was about to come true. The next day, at the crack of dawn, she went door to door calling the commune members, "Hey, let's go to the mountains to plant crops!" Her voice was full of joy.
    On the way to the mountains, she couldn't restrain herself and eagerly asked the Han Chinese cadres about agricultural technology. In the beginning, the Han Chinese cadres plowed in front, and she followed closely behind, learning attentively, not letting a single subtle movement escape her eyes. Even during meals, she pondered how to plow straight and how to use force to make the furrows even in depth, and then shared her insights with the commune members. Every morning, she went to the mountains to reclaim wasteland. By the time everyone had finished breakfast and started work, Guo Ba had already cleared a large piece of land.
    The herdsmen, using their hands accustomed to herding whips, had no experience in planting crops at first. The hoes were not installed correctly, and they broke one every few days, and they didn't know how to repair them. Guo Ba went to the blacksmiths and carpenters to learn how to repair them. Every night, while the girls who were clearing wasteland with her were sleeping soundly after a day's work, Guo Ba quietly left the tent and went to the moonlight to repair the tools. When the girls found out, they complained, "Why didn't you call everyone to go together! If you do it alone, what will happen if you get sick from exhaustion?" Guo Ba said, "I saw that you were tired, so I didn't dare to disturb you. When I think about cultivating more land and harvesting more grain, I forget about being tired!"
    This year, when the wheat ripened, Guo Ba was at the livestock team. One day, she took some time off and crossed mountains and rivers to get to the crop field, excitedly running from one end of the field to the other, gently stroking the sturdy barley ears, and bringing back a bundle of ears to say to the old people: "Look how strong these ears are! I never dreamed that we who feed livestock would be able to grow crops. We must not forget the Party even when we eat a grain of food!"

    Letting Livestock Production Ride on Swift Horses
    The livestock led by Guo Ba's production team are in good condition, and the survival rate is high. The eligible cows in the team gave birth to 325 calves this year, all of which survived and are strong. The old people all exclaimed, having touched cattle and horses their whole lives, they had never seen such big calves. This is all thanks to the Party's good leadership and also Guo Ba's hard work.
    The old people's praise for Guo Ba is not accidental. Last year, in order to develop animal husbandry at high speed, the commune wanted to send three people to learn the technology of artificial insemination and breeding. At that time, many people did not believe that artificial insemination could be used to impregnate cows and were unwilling to go. Guo Ba thought: I am a Party member and a captain, this is the time to take the lead, so she resolutely signed up with two female commune members to participate in the study. After returning from their studies, they were really busy. Building warm sheds and finding pregnant women's urine, they didn't know what it meant to be tired. In those days, many old people hid far away when they saw them, and some people said: "If people could impregnate cows, we wouldn't have been poor long ago!" Guo Ba didn't take these things to heart and always buried herself in her work. She thought: Someday everyone will understand. Later, when all the eligible cows in the team that had just given birth were inseminated and each gave birth to a calf, people gave her a thumbs-up.

    Caring for Commune Members More Than for Oneself
    Guo Ba always kept in mind the Party's teachings: "Be sure to care for the lives of the commune members." She thought that everyone eats in the cafeteria, so to care for the lives of the masses, she must first run the cafeteria well. Therefore, whenever she returned from the fields or the herds, regardless of wind or rain, she always went to the cafeteria first to discuss with the cooks how to make the food better. She led everyone in the "small autumn harvest" and achieved great results. The warehouses of their production team were filled with ginseng fruit and wild animal meat. She often ate and discussed with the cooks: "How should the staple and non-staple foods be combined to be both economical and filling and delicious?" Under her leadership, the cafeteria established a pregnant women's stove and a patient's stove. She also often helped the cooks deliver food to some seriously ill people. Some time ago, four of the six members of commune member Hua Shijie's family fell ill. Every day after returning from work, she always went to Hua Shijie's house to visit them, help them cook tea and decoct medicine, and sometimes even took her own money to hire a doctor for them. Hua Shijie was very moved and worked even more actively after recovering from his illness.

    飞起的凤凰
    郭巴，这个从前为牧主放牧受尽贫困折磨的妇女，如今在党的领导下，成为一个坚强能干的生产队女副队长。

    “栖在鸡窝里的凤凰展不开翅膀，飞起来的凤凰比苍鹰还高。”青海省果洛藏族自治州久治县苏胡日麻公社的生产队女副队长郭巴，就是那飞起来的凤凰。
    在草原上长大，从前为牧主放牧牛羊，生活十分贫困的郭巴，1958年公社成立担任了公社的第二生产队副队长。开头，人们喊她“队长”时，她很胆怯，不敢答应，脸红到耳朵根。她想，一个当过长工，要过饭的妇女能把乡亲们领导好吗？这时，党支部书记鼓励她要相信自己的力量，要作一个坚强勇敢的女战士。党的教导给郭巴增添了无限的信心和力量。她想：“只要有党的支持和教育，只要我没私心，听党的话，就没有作不成的事。
    让草原变成米粮川
    1959年秋天，牧区苏胡日麻公社响应党的号召，开始发展农业。一天晚上，郭巴兴冲冲地走回家，正在为她煮奶茶的妈妈，从来没见女儿这样兴奋过，当她还没弄清是怎么回事时，女儿已经坐在她跟前：
  “妈，咱们牧区也快种庄稼啦！明天一早我就要上山去开地啦！”这一夜，郭巴久久没有入睡，她想起二十多年前，当她还是孩子的时候，跋山涉水到四川阿坝讨饭的情景。她第一次看到那一眼望不到边的麦海。但是，地旁边站着横眉竖眼的大汉，哪敢挨边！她气恨地想：这地再富也是财主的。她忍不住梦想着什么时候家乡也能种上庄稼。现在，二十多年来的梦想就要实现了。第二天天麻麻亮，她就挨家挨户地叫社员，“哎，上山种地啦！”声音里充满喜悦。
    上山的路上，她就耐不住性子，如饥似渴地向汉族干部询问着有关农业技术的问题。开头那几天，汉族干部在前边犁，她就紧跟在后边用心地学，那怕是一个细小的动作也溜不过她的眼睛。甚至在吃饭时，她还琢磨着怎样犁得直，怎样使劲才能深浅匀称，然后又把自己的心得告诉给社员们。每天一清早她就上山开荒，等大家吃完早饭上工时，郭巴已开出一大片地。
    牧民们用使惯了牧羊鞭子的手种庄稼，开头一点经验也没有，镢头安得不对劲，几天坏一把，也不会修理。郭巴就跑到铁工、木工那里去学修理。每天晚上，当同她一起开荒的姑娘们劳动一天，正在甜蜜地睡眠时，郭巴却悄悄离开帐房，到月亮地里修理工具。姑娘们知道后埋怨说：“为什么不叫大家一起去！你一个人干，累病了可怎么办呵？”郭巴却说：“我看你们乏了，就没敢惊动你们，一想多耕地，多打粮食，我就忘记累啦！”
    今年麦子成熟的时候，郭巴正在畜牧队上。一天，她抽了个空，翻山涉水来到了庄稼地，兴奋地从地这头跑到地那头，又从地那头跑到地这头，轻轻抚摸着茁壮的青稞穗，还带回来一束穗，向老人们说：“你们看这穗头多壮实呀！做梦也没想到咱们喂牲口的人会种出庄稼，吃一粒粮食也不能忘了党啊！”
    让牧业生产骑上骏马
    郭巴所领导的生产队牲畜膘情好，成活率高，队上的适龄母牛今年产了三百二十五个牛犊，全部成活，个个健壮，老人们都感叹地说，摸了一辈子的牛马，没见过这样大的犊儿，这都是党的好领导，也有郭巴队长的心血呵。
    老人们夸奖郭巴不是偶然的，去年公社为了高速度发展畜牧业，要调三个人去学习人工催情、配种的技术，当时很多人不信能用人工给牛配上种，不愿意去。郭巴想：咱是党员，又是队长，这正是带头的时候，就毅然和两个女社员一起报名参加了学习。等学习回来，真把她们忙坏了。搞暖棚呀，找孕妇尿呀，就不知道什么叫疲倦。在那些日子里，许多老年人看见她们就躲得远远的，有的人说：“人要能给牛怀上犊，早先就不受穷了！”郭巴没有把这些放在心上，总是埋头工作，她想：总有一天大家会明白的。后来当队上刚刚产过犊的适龄母牛全部配上种，并且个个产了犊的时候，人们这才对她伸出了大拇指。
    关心社员胜过自己
    郭巴时时牢记党的教导：“一定要关心社员群众的生活。”她想，大家都在食堂吃饭，要关心群众生活得首先搞好食堂。因此每当她从田间或畜群里回来，不论刮风下雨，总是先到食堂里和炊事员商量怎样把饭食做得更好。她领导大家搞“小秋收”取得很大成绩。他们生产队仓库里的人参果和野牲肉装得满登登的。她常常一边吃饭一边跟炊事员合计：“主食和副食怎么搭配，才能既节约又吃得饱吃得好。”在她的主持下，食堂成立了孕妇灶和病号灶。她还时常帮助炊事员给一些重病号送饭。前些时候社员花十杰一家六口病倒了四口，她每天劳动回来，总要先到花十杰家去看望，帮他们煮茶、煎药，有时还自己拿钱给他们请大夫。花十杰十分感动，病好以后劳动更加积极。
