    The face of the Middle Gobi and South Gobi regions of Mongolia is changing day by day, and its past appearance is already hard to recognize.
    The Gobi region of Mongolia is vast and sparsely populated, with most of the land covered by sand dunes and deserts, and little rainfall. Due to the lack of people and water, nomadic grazing has long been the main production activity.
    After the implementation of pastoral cooperatives in the Gobi region in 1958, under the call of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party to accelerate socialist construction, the policy of focusing on animal husbandry while developing diversified operations was implemented, and the appearance changed dramatically.
    Since the vast number of herders settled down, many fixed constructions, such as offices, clinics, schools, and shops, have been established in the center of the cooperatives. Electric lights and telephones have also reached the Gobi region for the first time. The way people manage production has also changed, with livestock being managed in groups and breeds being actively improved, resulting in continuous increases in livestock product yields. This year, the wool yield per head of livestock has increased by more than 10% compared to last year, and the milk yield has increased by more than 15%. The income of cooperative members is also constantly improving, with pastoral income in South Gobi Province increasing from 3 million tugriks (Mongolian currency) in 1958 to 12.5 million tugriks in 1960.
    In the past, there was no agriculture in the Gobi region. This year, South Gobi Province and Middle Gobi Province also reclaimed 1,000 hectares and 250 hectares of wasteland, respectively, and tested the cultivation of crops such as barley, oats, and corn, with good harvests.
    While agriculture and animal husbandry are developing, the industrial, mining, transportation, and other industries have also achieved corresponding development. In the past, the Gobi region lacked trees and bricks, and there was no construction industry. Nowadays, in order to adapt to the settlement of herders and the development of various production undertakings, the province has established construction cooperatives and construction sideline teams. At the same time, sewing, carpentry, shoemaking, and food processing industries have also developed rapidly.

    昔日地广人稀如今百业兴旺
    蒙古戈壁面貌一新
    蒙古中戈壁和南戈壁地区的面貌在日新月异地变化，它过去的景象已经很难辨认了。
    蒙古戈壁地区地广人稀，绝大部分土地为沙丘和沙漠所掩盖，雨量稀少。由于缺人缺水，长期来流动放牧成为人们主要生产活动。
    戈壁地区在一九五八年实行牧业合作化后，在蒙古人民革命党中央加速社会主义建设的号召下，实行以畜牧为主同时发展多种经营的方针，面貌为之一变。
    自从广大牧民定居下来后，许多固定性建设，例如办公室、诊疗所、学校和商店等，纷纷在合作社中心建立起来。电灯电话也第一次通到了戈壁地区。人们生产经营的方式也随之改变，对牲畜实行分群管理并积极改良品种，畜产品的产量不断提高。今年每头牲畜的产毛量比去年提高百分之十以上，产奶量提高百分之十五以上。社员的收入也不断改善，南戈壁省一九五八年牧业收入为三百万图格里克（蒙币名），一九六○年增加到一千二百五十万图格里克。
    过去戈壁地区没有农业，今年南戈壁省和中戈壁省还分别开了一千公顷和二百五十公顷荒地，试种了大麦、燕麦和玉米等作物，而且收成良好。
    在农牧业发展的同时，工矿交通运输业也获得了相应的发展。戈壁地区过去无树缺砖，没有建筑工业。如今为了适应牧民定居和各项生产事业的发展，省成立了建筑合作社和建筑副业队。同时，缝纫、木工、制靴和食品加工行业也迅速发展起来了。
