Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 15th: The Japan-China Friendship Association today adopted a future action plan, calling on the Japanese people to vigorously launch a signature campaign from January to March next year to strive for the early restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations and demand the abolition of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

This action plan was adopted at the association's national board of directors meeting. It stipulates that the association will also collect signatures to demand the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations and the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Asia-Pacific region.

The plan also stipulates that the Japan-China Friendship Association will work to persuade the parliaments of various prefectures to pass resolutions requesting the government to intensify its efforts to break the current deadlock in Japan-China relations and to conclude a government-level trade agreement with China.

The plan points out that those who obstruct the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations have become isolated in the course of the rising people's movement. The plan emphasizes that the time has come to make unremitting efforts to strengthen the nationwide movement for the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations.

The Japan-China Friendship Association will hold meetings in many parts of the country to discuss current political issues such as Japan-China relations. The Japan-China Friendship Association will also hold report meetings where Japanese people who have recently returned from visits to China will give reports on their visits.

The Japan-China Friendship Association will continue to compile lists of Chinese people who were forcibly transported to Japan and killed by Japanese militarists during the war, as part of its activities against fostering Japanese militarism.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 17th: The Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Japan requested the government on the 13th to take positive measures to expand trade with China, the Soviet Union, and other socialist countries.

Japanese media figures say that this is the first time a capitalist economic organization has requested increased trade with China since trade with China stopped in May 1958.

According to Japanese radio reports, after the United States announced the transfer of the dollar crisis to its "allies," voices in Japanese economic circles demanding the development of trade with socialist countries are growing stronger. In particular, business people in Osaka, Japan's most developed industrial and trade area, are eager to develop trade with China because this area had traditional trade relations with China in the past.

Japan Shortwave Radio said: Currently, "what Japanese monopoly capital attaches the most importance to is the impact of the U.S. measures to protect the dollar on Japan and the issue of how to advance its policy towards China." This radio station also said: "On the diplomatic issue with China, since China cannot be ignored in the future, financial circles believe that the new Ikeda cabinet should seriously study this issue."

Opposition party members in the Japanese Diet also strongly demanded that the Japanese government restore Japan-China diplomatic relations and Japan-China trade, and opposed the Ikeda government's bowing to U.S. policy. Socialist Party member Mitsu Kono demanded during a question session on the 14th that Japanese Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda conclude a government-to-government trade agreement with China. The Japan-China Trade Promotion Association is launching activities to demand the conclusion of a government-to-government trade agreement between Japan and China.

However, Japanese Prime Minister Ikeda said in the Diet on the 14th that he would still look to the United States for guidance on the issue of Japan-China relations. His statement was: regarding the issue of diplomatic relations with China, he is prepared to "see what the various countries think in the United Nations."

    争取恢复日中邦交要求废除日美条约
    日本经济界人士和议员要求扩大日中贸易活动
    新华社15日讯　东京消息：日中友好协会今天通过了今后行动方针，号召日本人民在明年1月到3月期间，大力开展争取早日恢复日中邦交和要求废除日美军事同盟条约的签名运动。
    这个行动方针是在协会的全国常务理事会上通过的。它规定，协会也为了要求恢复中国在联合国的合法地位，要求在亚洲和太平洋地区建立无核武器地区而征集签名。
    方针还规定，日中友好协会将进行工作，争取各县的议会通过决议，要求政府加紧努力来打开目前日中关系的僵局，并同中国缔结政府级贸易协定。
    方针指出，那些阻挠恢复日中邦交的分子，在人民运动高涨的过程中已经陷于孤立。方针强调说，作出不屈不挠的努力来加强争取恢复日中邦交全国性运动的时候已经到来。
    日中友好协会将在全国许多地方举行会议，在这些会议上讨论日中关系等当前的政治问题。日中友好协会还将举办报告会，由最近从中国访问归来的日本人士作访华报告。
      日中友好协会将继续编制在战时被日本军国主义者强迫运到日本并被杀害的中国人的名单，作为它反对扶植日本军国主义的活动的一部分。
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：日本大阪商工会议所13日要求政府采取积极措施来扩大同中国、苏联以及其他社会主义国家间的贸易。
    日本新闻界人士说，这是自从1958年5月同中国的贸易停止以后，资本家的经济团体第一次要求增加同中国的贸易。
    据日本电台报道，美国宣布向它的“盟国”转嫁美元危机以后，日本经济界要求发展同社会主义国家间的贸易的呼声日益强烈。特别是日本最发达的工业和贸易地区大阪的企业界人士迫切希望同中国发展贸易，因为这个地区过去同中国有传统的贸易关系。
    日本短波电台说：目前，“日本垄断资本最重视的是美国保卫美元措施对日本的影响以及如何推进对中国的政策的问题”。这家电台还说：“在对中国的外交问题上，因为今后不可能忽视中国，所以金融实业界认为，池田新内阁应该认真研究这个问题”。
    日本在野党议员在国会会议上也强烈要求日本政府恢复日中邦交和日中贸易，反对池田政府屈从美国的政策。社会党议员河野密14日在质询时要求日本首相池田勇人同中国缔结政府间贸易协定。日中贸易促进会正在展开要求缔结日中两国政府间贸易协定的活动。
    然而，日本首相池田14日在国会里仍然表示在日中关系问题上要看美国的眼色行事。他的说法是：关于同中国的邦交问题，准备“看看各国在联合国的想法”。
