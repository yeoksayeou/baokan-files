American Progressives Praise China's Peking Opera Art
Accuse U.S. Authorities of Obstructing Cultural Exchange

    (Reported by this newspaper) Helen Nearing, an American progressive who visited China in 1957, recently published an article in the American magazine "New World Review" entitled "Peking Opera in Canada," accusing the U.S. State Department of "depriving American citizens of the opportunity to see this highly skilled artistic drama (referring to China's Peking Opera)," and arguing that this obstruction of cultural exchange is "very stupid."

    Helen Nearing wrote that she and her husband, Scott Nearing, had made "a 15,000-mile trip" to see Peking Opera in Beijing. Because the U.S. State Department revoked their passports and prohibited them from going to Beijing again, they then "made a 1,500-mile trip to Montreal, Canada, to see Peking Opera."

    The author described the grand occasion of the Chinese Art Troupe's performances in seven major Canadian cities, believing it was "a victorious tour, allowing tens of thousands of enthusiastic Canadian audiences to see brilliant performances and dances, amazing martial arts techniques, and dazzling costumes."

    The author then criticized the U.S. State Department, writing: "The U.S. State Department deprives American citizens of the opportunity to see this highly skilled artistic drama, which is very stupid. We cannot go to China, nor can we see this art in our own country, and we are the ones who suffer the loss." She also said: "We four (referring to her husband and friends who crossed the border to see Peking Opera together) are just a few of the Americans who traveled hundreds of miles to watch this fascinating performance. We saw or met more than half a dozen American friends and acquaintances in the audience, all of whom felt that their trip was worthwhile, and their praise for the performance was as enthusiastic as that of the Canadians."

    After describing the enthusiastic praise of the Canadian people and newspapers for Chinese Peking Opera, Helen Nearing seriously raised the following question: "How long will it take for the American authorities to stick their heads out of the sand and recognize that there is such a splendid world here, with such unlimited possibilities for cooperation and co-existence, to gain friendship and appreciation?"

    美进步人士赞扬我国京剧艺术
    指责美国当局阻挠文化交流
    本报讯　曾于1957年来我国访问的美国进步人士海伦·尼尔林最近在美国刊物《新世界评论》上发表了一篇题为《京剧在加拿大》的短文，指责美国国务院“剥夺了美国公民观看这种造诣高超的艺术戏剧（指我国京剧）的机会”，认为这种阻挠文化交流的行为“是很愚蠢的”。
    海伦·尼尔林写道，她曾同她的丈夫斯科特·尼尔林在作了“一次一万五千哩的旅行”后才在北京看到了京剧，由于美国国务院吊销了他们的护照，不准他们再去北京，因此才又“作了一次一千五百哩的旅行到加拿大的蒙特利尔城去看京戏”。
    作者叙述了中国艺术团在加拿大七大城市演出的盛况，她认为这是“一次胜利的巡回演出，使数万热烈的加拿大观众看到了辉煌的表演和舞蹈、惊人的武打技术和绚丽夺目的服装。”
    作者接着对美国国务院提出了指责，她写道：“美国国务院剥夺了美国公民观看这种造诣高超的艺术戏剧的机会，这是很愚蠢的。我们既不能前往中国，又不能在我们自己国土上看到这种艺术，受损失的是我们自己。”她还说：“我们四人
  （指她的丈夫和一起越境看京戏的朋友）只是旅行数百哩前往观看这种迷人的演出的美国人之中的几个。我们在观众中看到或遇到的半打以上的美国朋友和熟人，无不感到他们并没有虚此一行，他们对演出的称赞和加拿大人一样热烈。”
    海伦·尼尔林在描绘了加拿大人民和报刊对中国京剧的热烈赞扬以后，严肃地提出了下面这个问题：“究竟要等到几时美国当局才会从沙子里伸出头来认识到在这里还有这样一种灿烂的世界，还具有这样无限的进行合作和共处，得到友谊和欣赏的可能性呢？”
