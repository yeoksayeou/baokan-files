Tao Mei

    We pushed the manure cart and walked out of the east gate. We began to see scattered groups of people working and hear the faint sound of singing. A large, round, red sun had just risen from the horizon, and the clouds in the sky, the boundless fields, and our whole bodies were instantly dyed a layer of orange-red.
    At this moment, the fragrance of osmanthus wafted towards us, and a familiar face flashed before my eyes, quickly disappearing again. Who, who? Finally, I remembered: Wasn't that Tao Mei!
    Three years ago, I parted with her by this osmanthus tree. At that time, this was a winding path. She carried a load of luggage, her braids swaying as she walked forward. I hoped she would turn around and wave to me, but no, she didn't even turn her head.
    Tao Mei and I had been classmates since we were little. I first met her when I was biting on the end of my brush, and she came to help me with an arithmetic problem. From then on, she became my best friend. On rainy days, we ran barefoot, chasing a leaf drifting down the stream, to school. Under the kerosene lamp, we studied together, chatting about everything and nothing. She once told me a story about "Bitter Plum Slope": many years ago, in her hometown of Li Village, there was a widow whose husband was beaten to death by a landlord. She was forced to open up land on a barren slope to survive. Spring flowers bloomed, autumn leaves fell, and year after year passed, she dug out a small plot of land. But nothing would grow, and she finally starved to death on the barren slope. Legend has it that on cold, windy, and moonlit nights, the desolate slope can still faintly hear the widow of the Li family crying sadly. The locals called the barren slope "Bitter Plum Slope." This story left a deep impression on me. When I was in junior high school, I asked her: What about Bitter Plum Slope now? She didn't answer me, but just sang a folk song to me in a low voice: "Bitter plums have turned over, the rice grows golden yellow..."
    On the day we graduated from junior high school, as soon as we got our diplomas, she ran over to me with a letter, happily saying, "Let's go, let's transform Bitter Plum Slope!" I was stunned, but before I could ask, she spoke rapidly, "The Party branch secretary of the commune wrote a letter, he welcomes us to go. Sigh, I've been wanting to go so badly!" She tugged at my sleeve and said, "There's land there, just like Bitter Plum Slope, high ground, poor soil, no water, the yield is terribly low. It's the root of poverty in our village. We must change it!..." I said, "No, Tao Mei, let's go take the teacher's college entrance exam, they're recruiting... This is for your future!" She got angry at me, "Future, does the countryside have no future?!" Her eyes fixed on me, her lips trembling slightly, as if she had many more words to say, but she ignored me...
    In the blink of an eye, several years have passed. Now that I think about it, I feel that the path she took was very right. Not long ago, the teachers and students of our county's teacher's college were doing propaganda on the streets for vigorously developing agriculture and grain production. I met her mother, who was also preparing to go to her. Talking about Tao Mei, her mother said that Tao Mei had become the team leader, wore a red flower this spring, and joined the Party. Before leaving, her mother chuckled and said, "This girl, she insisted on going to the countryside to make a name for herself, and she did!"
    The sun gradually rose, and the row of villages in the distance became clearer. We pushed several carts of manure, following the tracks of the tractor, creaking and groaning forward. I looked up and saw white clouds floating in the blue sky, and below the clouds, a bright red flag fluttered. The red flag fluttered closer and closer, accompanied by the joyful singing and steps of young men and women. In the rippling singing, a clear shout echoed: "Comrades, you've worked hard!"
    Coming closer, we saw that the person speaking at the front was a young girl, wearing a plaid shirt, blue pants rolled up at the cuffs; a white towel wrapped around her head, a slightly dark pink face, raising two not-too-thin eyebrows, a pair of bright eyes, full of simplicity, neatness, and closeness, constantly looking at us. I almost cried out, wasn't this her!
    Yes, this was Tao Mei.
    Tao Mei waved her hand, and they swarmed over to push the carts with us. I called out to her, "Tao Mei!" She turned her head, saw me, paused, and said with a smile, "Huh, you're here! I heard from my mother a long time ago that you were coming to support the team. We were preparing to welcome you! Let's go, that field is still east of the village." I deliberately said, "How will you welcome us?" She said confidently, "Ha! Hydropower station, high-yield plot, club, top-notch cafeteria, agricultural research station... Is that enough?" She leaned closer to me: "If you're still not satisfied, come play at my house, I'll cook you some eggs. But, I also need to discuss a physics problem with you..."
    The cart bumped forward, and my arm vibrated along with it. We walked onto a stone bridge, and a rushing sound echoed at our feet. I looked down and, strangely, a stream flowed underneath, and a water trough was built over the stream. Just as I was wondering, Tao Mei explained, "This is called an aqueduct. Look! That's the Happiness Reservoir, built last year."
    Singing and talking, everyone pushed the manure cart faster. A village appeared before my eyes. Lush green trees interspersed in the village, revealing rows of newly painted white walls, chimneys rising from the roofs. A stream flowed by the village, and waterwheels creaked. Walking into the village, many different kinds of houses attracted me. Tao Mei kept introducing them to me: "That one with two glass display windows at the entrance is the cafeteria and club; that red brick wall with a chimney in the distance is the by-product processing factory, and next door is a fertilizer factory; that one facing south with the door half-open, a blackboard at the entrance, and a rain gauge, is the agricultural science research station and amateur night school..." Just as she was speaking, a girl next to her made a gesture to Tao Mei and said playfully, "This is our teacher!"
    "Chatterbox, chatterbox!" Tao Mei smiled, bit her lip, glared at her, her face reddening.
    "I'm going to say it, I'm going to say it! You're also the 'chief of staff' of the cafeteria and the deputy leader of our scientific research station!"
    Tao Mei raised her hand, wanting to tease her, but there was a cart in between. She had to put her hand down, shaking her head helplessly. Tao Mei said earnestly, "Having a few books in your stomach, what do you know! Production and work still rely on the comrades of the branch committee, rely on the experienced elders. That winter when I went up the mountain to chop firewood, everyone else chopped vines to use as rope, but I brought a rope, it was really laughable. Besides, when I first entered the kitchen, I couldn't even add wood to the fire. Many things, I learned from others."
    Not far past the village was a high slope. The slope had been cleared of large and small plots of land, mostly planted with winter crops, and some places were planted with various fruit trees. The cart became heavier and heavier, and I was sweating all over. Just as I was exerting myself, I saw Tao Mei straighten up, wave her hand to everyone, and shout, "The time to use your strength has come!" Tao Mei closed her mouth, pushed hard upwards, and a bright light suddenly appeared on her dark red face. Everyone made a concerted effort and rushed up. I took a breath, stretched my body, and looked ahead, seeing a sign stuck in the field, which read: "Youth Commando High-Yield Plot."
    Unexpectedly, this was a new world! The gurgling canal water, along the two-tiered high and low fields, was neatly crisscrossed. The fields had already been planted with wheat and rapeseed, a green expanse, the soil was very fertile and black, and a thin green smoke seemed to rise from it as it evaporated in the sun. We poured the manure into the manure pond, then left the cart and took a look at the land. I broke off a branch and stuck it into the field, and it went in a long way without any effort. I picked up a piece of black soil, tender and fine, and it crumbled with a twist, it was really good land.
    "This is our 'pace-setter land', planting two crops of rice a year, this year we harvested more than a thousand catties per mu!" I asked in surprise, Tao Mei glanced at me, smiling: "It's not surprising, 'Where there's a will, there's a way', just take this piece of land, the soil quality was terrible. Okay, you're bad, we'll bring in water, we'll mix in sand, we'll transport fertilizer... We're not afraid you won't change!"
    I stood up and showed her the soil in my hand: "This will take a lot of fertilizer!" Tao Mei said, "Go over the mountains, go to the village, the bird fertilizer in the forest, the thatch ash all over the mountain, and the fertile mud, manure, there's plenty, plus the chemical fertilizer we make ourselves, as long as we pick it and transport it, we don't have to worry about fertilizer."
    These words were spoken so easily from her mouth. But I knew that transporting several loads of fertilizer, transforming one mu of low-yield land, digging out a root of poverty, and exchanging it for a rich team, I don't know how many dry spells with no rain, how many nights of heavy rain, I don't know how much effort and sweat it would take! I really wanted to know these things. But in my mind, a question that I had wanted to know for a long time suddenly popped up.
    "Tao Mei, what about Bitter Plum Slope?"
    "Bitter Plum Slope?" Tao Mei was stunned for a moment, looking at me mischievously with her watery eyes, then glancing at her companions. The young commune members burst into laughter. In the laughter, Lanlan said to me in a loud voice: "No--o! We don't have 'Bitter Plum Slope' here, only Happ——iness, Slope!" My face couldn't help but start to burn. Who knew that Tao Mei would stop laughing and say seriously:
    "You want to ask about Bitter Plum Slope? There are still many stories about Bitter Plum Slope! Now, let's all go to our village for lunch." We pushed the carts and sang again, happily walking down the slope. Tao Mei walked closer to me and said, "Come to my house at noon, my mother will be there too. Then, I'll tell you. This story is not about others, it's about the Party, it's about everyone."

    桃妹

    我们推着粪车，走出了东门。我们开始看到点点劳动的人群，听到悠悠飘来的歌声。而一轮满大的红日，又刚刚从地平线上升起，天边的云朵，无垠的田地，我们的全身，霎时染上了一层橙红的颜色。
    这时，一阵桂花香迎面扑来，我眼前蓦然闪过一个熟悉的面影，很快又消失了。谁，谁？终于记起来了：这不是桃妹吗！
    三年前的一天，我就是在这棵桂花树边和她分手的。那时，这里是一条弯曲的小道。她挑着一担行李，晃荡着一双辫子，一闪一闪地朝前走去。我希望她能回头来，向我招一招手，可是不，她头也没回。
    我和桃妹从小就是同学。最初认识她，是在我咬着毛笔杆子的时候，她跑来帮我做了一道算术。从那以后，她就成为我最要好的朋友。下雨天，我们打着赤脚，追逐顺水漂流的一片叶子，到学校里去。煤油灯下，我们一同温习功课，没事就谈天说地。她曾给我讲过一个“苦李坪”的故事：很多年以前，她的家乡李家村有个寡妇，丈夫被地主打死了，她被逼到一个荒坪上去开地求生。春花开了，秋叶落了，一年年地过去，挖出了一小块田地。可是什么也长不出来，她终于饿死在荒坪上。传说每当寒风淡月的夜晚，那荒坪还隐约可以听到李家寡妇悲苦的哭泣声。当地人就把荒坪叫“苦李坪”。这故事给我留下了深刻的印象。初中的时候，我问过她：现在的苦李坪呢？她没有回答我，只是低声唱着山歌给我听：“苦李呀翻了身，谷子长得黄橙橙……”
    初中毕业那一天，我们刚得到文凭，她拿着一封信跑来高高兴兴地对我说：“走，改造苦李坪去！”我楞了一下，但是不等我问清楚，她又火辣辣地一口气讲下去，“社里党支书来信了，他欢迎我们去。唉，我想都想死啦！”她扯了扯我的袖子，说：“那里有的田，跟苦李坪一样，地高，土差，没水，产量低得要命。这是我们村的穷根子啊。我们哪，一定把它改过来！……”我说：“不，桃妹，我们还是去考师范吧，那里正招生……这，也是为了你的前途啊！”我把她说恼了：“前途，农村就没有前途？！”她的眼睛盯住我，嘴唇轻轻地颤抖着，好像还有许多话要说，可是她没睬我……
    转眼又是好几年了。现在想来，觉得她走的道非常对。前不久，我们县中师生在街上作大办农业，大办粮食的宣传，我遇上了她妈，她妈也准备到她那里去。谈起桃妹，她妈说，桃妹干上队长了，今年春上戴了红花，并且入了党。临走，她妈嘿嘿笑了，说：“这丫头，她硬要到乡下去闯，可闯出来啦！”
    太阳渐渐升起，那远远的一溜村子也显得清晰了起来。我们推着几车粪肥，顺着拖拉机碾过的辙印，吱吱呢呢地向前走去。我举目一望，只见一朵朵白云在碧蓝的天空飘游，白云下面拂闪着一面鲜艳夺目的红旗。红旗越飘越近了，随着飘来了一些欢歌迈步的青年男女。在那荡漾的歌声中，响着一个清脆的喊声：“同志们，辛苦了！”
    走了近来，我们看到为头说话的是一位青年姑娘，穿一件花格子褂子，蓝裤子卷着裤筒；头上蒙块白手巾，一副略带黑色的粉红脸庞，扬起两弯不算太细的眉毛，那一对晶亮的眼睛，充满着淳朴、利索、亲近的神色，不停地打量着我们。我几乎叫了起来，这不就是她吗！
    是的，这就是桃妹。
    桃妹一招手，他们就拥过来和我们一道推车。我唤她：“桃妹！”她转过头来看到了我，楞了一下，笑着说：“哼，你来啦！我早就听妈说，你们要来支援队里。我们正准备着欢迎你们呢！走，那田还在村东。”我故意说：“你用什么欢迎呢？”她自信地说：“哈！水电站，丰产方，俱乐部，十好食堂，农业研究站……行吧？”又凑近我：“还嫌不够，就去我家玩玩，给你煮上几个鸡蛋。不过，还得顺便和你研究一个物理上的问题……”
    车子一颠一簸地向前走，我的胳膊也跟着震动了起来。我们走上石桥，一阵哗哗声在脚边响着。我朝下一看，怪，一道溪河从下面穿过去了，溪河上又架有一道水槽。正疑惑着，桃妹解释说：“这叫渡槽。瞧！那就是幸福水库，去年修的。”
    说着唱着，大家把粪车推得更快。一个村子显现在我的眼前。绿葱葱的树丛穿插在村落里，露出一排一排新粉的白墙，屋顶上矗起一些烟囱。村边，一条溪水流过，筒车在吱呀地响着。走进村里，许多各种各样的房屋把我吸引住了。桃妹不停地给我介绍着：那个大门口摆了二个玻璃宣传窗的，是食堂兼俱乐部；那远处红砖墙冒烟囱的房子是副产品加工厂，隔壁是一所化肥厂；那靠南一幢半开着大门，门口竖了块黑板，还有个量雨池的，是农业科学研究站和业余夜校……正说着，旁边一位姑娘朝桃妹作了个手势，调皮地说：“这位就是我们的老师！”
    “多嘴鸟多嘴！”桃妹笑咬着嘴唇，瞪了她一眼，脸红了。
    “就要说，就要说！你还是食堂的‘参谋长’，我们科学研究站的副组长哩！”
    桃妹扬起手，想整一整她，但是中间又隔着车。她只得把手放下来，无可奈何地摇了摇头。桃妹认真地说：“肚子里装几本书，懂个啥呢！生产、工作，还不是仗着支委会的同志，仗着有经验的老大伯。那年冬天上山砍柴，人家都砍藤当绳捆，我却带了根绳去，真是笑死人。再说，我初进厨房，就连火都不会加。许多事呀，都是打别人那里学来的。”
    过村子不远，就是一个高坡。坡上大大小小的地开出来了，大都种上了冬作物，有的地方还栽上了各色果树。车子越推越沉，浑身直冒汗。正吃着力，只见桃妹直起身子，向大家一挥手，喊道：“用劲的时候到啦！”桃妹闭住嘴，使劲往上撞，黑里带红的脸上忽然发出亮眼的光泽。大伙一鼓作气，冲了上去。我透了一口气，舒展身躯朝前望去，见田头插着一个标牌，上面写的是：“青年突击队丰产方”。
    想不到这里却是一个新的天地！汪汪渠水沿着二层一高一低的田地，齐整地纵横交错着。田里已经种上了小麦和油菜，绿油油的一片，土质肥黑得很，似乎被太阳蒸发得冒起一股微薄的青烟。我们将粪倒在粪池里，就搁下车子，先看一看地。我折了一根树枝往田里一插，不费劲就进去了一大截，又拣起一块黑土，细嫩嫩的，一捻就碎，真是好地呀。
    “这就是我们的‘标兵地’，一年种两季稻子，今年我们一亩就打了一千多！”我惊异地打着疑问，桃妹瞅了我一眼，笑着说：“这也不奇怪，‘愚公移山，事在人干’，就说这块地吧，土质坏透了。好，你坏吧，我们给引来水，我们给掺进沙，我们给运来肥……不怕你改不过来！”
    我站起来，把手上的土捧给她看：“这可要不少肥啊！”桃妹说，“翻山呗，到村里去呗，那树林的鸟肥呀，满山的茅草灰呀，还有肥泥呀，大粪呀，多得很，再加上我们自己制造的化学肥料，只要去挑去运，不愁没肥。”
    这些话从她口里讲出，是多么地轻松。然而我知道，运上几担肥料，改造一亩低产田，挖掉一个穷根子，换来一个富队，不知道要斗过多少久旱不雨的晴天，多少暴雨猛落的夜晚，不知道要费去多少心血和汗珠啊！这些，我都很想知道。可是在我的脑子里，却偏偏蹦出一个长久以来就很想知道的问题。
    “桃妹，苦李坪呢？”
    “苦李坪？”桃妹楞了一下，用一双水汪汪的眼珠调皮地望着我，又扫向她的伙伴。那些年轻社员们轰的笑了起来。笑声中兰兰用高嗓子对我说：“没——有！我们这里没有‘苦李坪’，只有幸，福，坪！”我的脸上不由得发起烧来，谁知桃妹收敛了笑，认真地说：
    “你要问苦李坪吗？关于苦李坪的故事还有很多哩！现在，都到我们村里去吃午饭吧。”我们推着车，又唱起歌来，高高兴兴地走下坡去。桃妹走近了我，说：“中午，你到我家去，我妈也在。那时候，再讲给你听。这故事讲的不是别人，是党，是大家伙。”
