Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 28th: Our reporter reports: The German Democratic Republic has achieved remarkable results in the socialist transformation of agriculture and agricultural production this year. Within this year, all rural areas in the entire republic have completed the full cooperativization of agriculture, and agricultural production has developed at an unprecedented speed in the past few years. New and prosperous scenes are everywhere in the rural areas of the country.

This year, the agricultural cooperativization movement in the German Democratic Republic has progressed very rapidly. In early March of this year, the Rostock District, bordering the Baltic Sea, first reported the good news of the complete cooperativization of agriculture. Immediately afterwards, the cooperative upsurge swept the country. In just over a month, farmers in all fourteen districts of the republic and the suburbs of Democratic Berlin successively embarked on the road of collective management. With the exception of a very small amount of land in individual areas that is not suitable for large-scale cultivation, approximately 6.4 million hectares of arable land in the republic are now entirely managed by agricultural cooperatives and state farms.

The cooperative rural economy has continuously demonstrated its enormous superiority in this year's production. During this year's spring sowing, the natural conditions in the German Democratic Republic were not good. Spring came late, and the soil moisture shortage caused by last year's drought and winter dryness had not been eliminated. However, since farmers participated in cooperatives in entire townships and counties, the land was connected into one piece and collective labor began, the national spring sowing work was generally completed earlier than last year. During the summer harvest, although the harvest season came later and the weather was consistently bad during the harvest period, the cooperative members, with the support of all walks of life in the country, used machines to harvest on large areas of land, saving a lot of time, manpower, and materials, and the harvesting work was still able to be completed within the same time as last year.

Agricultural cooperativization has brought fruitful results to agricultural production. According to statistics, the unit area yield of various major crops this year has increased more than in the past few years. The average grain yield reached 27.5 quintals per hectare, exceeding the average yield of previous years. The average yield of potatoes per hectare reached 194.9 quintals, which is the highest potato yield since the founding of the German Democratic Republic. The planting area of ​​maize has more than doubled compared with last year, and the average unit area yield has increased by about 20% compared with last year. At the same time, animal husbandry production has also achieved greater results. The number of cattle and pigs raised reached more than 4,679,000 and 8,283,000 respectively at the end of November this year, an increase of 4.8% and 3.5% over last year.

At present, the vast majority of cooperatives in the German Democratic Republic have been consolidated, and collective management is being strengthened. In the past six months, most of the newly established Type I cooperatives (primary cooperatives) have successively organized "production teams." In some advanced production teams, farmers brought their own horses, farm implements, etc. into the team, strengthening the economic strength of the cooperative. In order to better use modern agricultural machinery and equipment and formulate scientific land rotation plans, and further improve production, the newly established agricultural cooperatives have also begun to unite land and merge several Type I cooperatives in the same village into a large cooperative. At the same time, the newly joined cooperative farmers launched mutual assistance and competition between teams, villages, and townships under the slogan of "everyone for everyone" during this year's summer harvest, autumn harvest, and autumn sowing. The collectivist ideology of the members is constantly improving.

With the realization of full cooperativization, new scenes have also appeared in rural cultural and educational undertakings. In order to meet the needs of farmers for scientific and technological knowledge, there are currently 2,000 amateur agricultural schools and various training classes in the country. A large number of farmers participated in the study. At the same time, rural cultural life has also become active, and there are now more than 5,000 rural clubs across the country. At present, various localities are using the winter slack season to carry out rural cultural and sports activities.

The beautiful future prospects of the countryside demonstrated by full cooperativization are changing people's views on the countryside and agricultural production. Many advanced youths have criticized the old view of not wanting to engage in agricultural labor and are determined to stay in the countryside and create their own happy life with their own hands. Women's enthusiasm has also been brought into play after the realization of full cooperativization. At present, female members account for 45% of the more than 950,000 agricultural production cooperative members. One hundred and forty-seven cooperatives across the country are chaired by women.

    生产迅速发展　文化生活活跃
    德农村合作化后呈现新景象
    新华社柏林28日电　本社记者报道：德意志民主共和国今年在农业的社会主义改造和农业生产中获得了显著的成绩。在这一年内，全共和国所有的农村已完成了农业全部合作化，农业生产以过去几年所未有的速度向前发展。全国农村到处呈现出欣欣向荣的新气象。
    今年，德意志民主共和国农业合作化运动的进展十分迅速。在今年3月初，频临波罗的海的罗斯托克专区首先传出了农业全部合作化的捷报。紧接着，合作化高潮席卷全国。在短短的一个多月中，全共和国十四个专区和柏林民主区郊区的农民便相继走上了集体经营的道路。除了个别地区的极少数不适于大规模耕种的土地以外，共和国大约六百四十万公顷的耕地，已经完全由农业合作社和国营农场经营。
    合作化后的农村经济在今年的生产中不断显示出巨大的优越性。在今年春播的时候，德意志民主共和国的自然条件不好，春天姗姗来迟，去年干旱和冬季干燥所造成的土壤缺水情况还未消除。但是，由于农民整乡整县地参加了合作社，土地连成一片，并开始集体劳动，全国春播工作一般仍比去年完成得早。在夏收的时候，虽然收割季节来得较晚，收获期间天气一直不好，但是，合作社社员们在全国各行各业的支援下，用机器在大片土地上收割，节约了不少时间、人力和物力，收获工作仍然能够在和去年相同的时间内完成。
    农业合作化已为农业生产带来了丰硕的果实。据统计，今年各种主要作物的单位面积产量的增长都比过去几年高。谷物产量平均每公顷达二十七点五公担，超过前几年的平均产量。马铃薯每公顷平均产量达一百九十四点九公担，这是德意志民主共和国建国以来马铃薯产量最高的一年。玉蜀黍种植面积比去年扩大一倍多，平均单位面积产量较去年提高约20％。同时，畜牧业生产也取得了较大的成绩。牛和猪的饲养头数在今年11月底分别达到四百六十七万九千多头和八百二十八万三千口，比去年增长4.8％和3.5％。
    目前，德意志民主共和国的绝大部分合作社已经得到了巩固，集体经营正在加强。半年以来，大部分新成立的一型社（初级社）都先后组织起“生产队”。在一些先进的生产队里，农民把自己的马、农具等带进队来，加强了合作社的经济力量。为了更好地使用现代农业机械设备和制定科学的土地轮种计划，进一步提高生产，新建立的农业合作社也已开始联合土地和把同一个乡村中的几个一型社合并为一个大社。与此同时，新参加合作社的农民在今年夏收、秋收和秋种期间，在“人人为大家”的口号下，展开了队与队、村与村、乡与乡之间的互助和竞赛。社员们的集体主义思想不断提高。
    随着全部合作化的实现，农村的文化教育事业也出现了新气象。为了适应农民对科学技术知识的需要，目前全共和国已办有两千所业余性质的农业学校和各种训练班。大批农民参加了学习。同时，农村的文化生活也活跃起来，全国已有五千多个农村俱乐部。目前，各地正利用冬季农闲时间开展农村文化体育活动。
    全部合作化展示的农村美好的未来远景，正在改变着人们对农村和农业生产的看法，许多先进青年批判了不愿从事农业劳动的旧观点，决心留在农村，用双手创造自己的幸福生活。妇女的积极性在实现全部合作化后也得到了发挥。目前，在九十五万多个农业生产合作社社员中，女社员占45％。全国有一百四十七个合作社由妇女担任主席。
