Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang Electric Dispatch: This year, a large number of cadres in Jiangxi Province were transferred to poor teams, mountainous areas, and low-yield areas. They closely united and relied on local grassroots cadres, shared weal and woe with the masses, and worked steadily. They led the masses to make great achievements in helping poor teams catch up with rich teams, mountainous areas catch up with plains areas, and low-yield areas catch up with high-yield areas. At present, of the province's more than 5,100 poor teams, about one-third have caught up with or exceeded the production level of rich teams under the joint efforts of local people, cadres, and downward-transferred cadres over the past year, and the appearance of mountainous and low-yield areas has greatly changed.

This year, Party committees at all levels in Jiangxi Province selected a large number of outstanding cadres with rural work experience to transfer to poor teams, remote mountainous areas, and low-yield areas, so that these areas averaged two to three downward-transferred cadres per commune and production team serving concurrently or holding grassroots leadership positions. After arriving in these areas, they all first strengthened political leadership. The cadres in Fuzhou Prefecture who were transferred to 314 poor teams and backward teams generally strengthened political leadership in three aspects: First, further giving play to the core leadership role of the Party, so that Party organizations become bastions for implementing the Party's policies; second, fully establishing the leadership advantages of cadres from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds, and convening symposiums of commune members from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds to listen to the opinions of the basic masses; third, further promoting a democratic style of work, improving democratic life, and discussing major issues through commune members. After the 59 county-level and commune Party committee secretary-level cadres transferred to 25 poor teams in Zixi County strengthened political leadership in these three aspects, they greatly enhanced the combat effectiveness of Party organizations and cultivated a large number of activists from poor and lower-middle peasant commune members, thereby enabling the vigorous implementation of the Party's policies and giving full play to the enthusiasm of the masses. The downward-transferred cadres also closely united and relied on local grassroots cadres, helping them improve their policy level, improve leadership methods, and fully mobilize and give play to their work enthusiasm.

On the basis of strengthening political leadership, the downward-transferred cadres, together with local grassroots cadres, led the masses to universally carry out large-scale discussions and summaries on whether or not to catch up with rich teams, catch up with plains areas, and catch up with high-yields, and how to catch up with rich teams, catch up with plains areas, and catch up with high-yields. They publicized and promoted various advanced experiences, planted red flags, set up role models, and greatly boosted the confidence of the masses. In the five mountainous communes of Wuqiao, Cunqian, Hualin, Yanxi, and Tiannan in Gaoan County, many people originally believed that mountainous areas were high and cold, with poor natural conditions, and that grain production could not catch up with the plains. The downward-transferred cadres led the masses to summarize local advanced experiences and analyzed the favorable conditions of manpower and material resources after communization, greatly enhancing the masses' confidence in changing the appearance of mountainous areas. The commune members immediately issued challenge letters to the suburban commune in the plains area and launched a production competition. Taiping Brigade of Zuobi Commune in Xinfeng County is a place of poor mountains and rivers, and many people think that there is no future in engaging in grain production. The downward-transferred cadre, Commune Party Secretary Zhong Chongxiang, personally worked with the brigade cadres to deeply summarize the experience of the first team of this brigade from the annual grain shortage before communization to grain self-sufficiency and surplus, set up a role model, and boosted the enthusiasm of the masses, determined to catch up with the rich teams.

While carrying out these tasks, the downward-transferred cadres implemented the policy of taking grain as the key link and vigorously grasped production in accordance with local conditions. According to the characteristics that poor teams generally have slow development of grain production and single management projects, the cadres transferred to the poor teams mobilized the masses to vigorously grasp grain production and develop diversified management. In the past, Limu Brigade of Gaotian Commune in Zixi County mostly only planted one season, and grain could not be self-sufficient. The cadre Lin Xinghui, who was transferred to this brigade as the Party branch secretary, led the masses to tap the potential of the land, and together with the masses, he entered the fields and went up the mountains, changing late rice to early rice, wasteland to cultivated land, and one season to two seasons in accordance with local conditions, so that the planting area of double-cropping rice was much larger than last year. He also organized commune members to develop forestry and sideline production, so that the entire team not only greatly developed grain production and achieved grain self-sufficiency, but also increased forestry and sideline income compared to last year. At the end of the year, the pre-distribution of income to all commune members increased, making it one of the pacesetters for poor teams catching up with rich teams in the county. Cai Yanchao, a cadre transferred to Beikeng Production Team, a poor team in Shanzheng Commune, Xingan County, as the Party branch secretary, mobilized the masses to try every possible means to reclaim wasteland and expand the planting of grain crops by more than 800 mu. The local cadres and commune members were very enthusiastic and advocated replanting all 610 mu of paddy fields with continuous double-cropping rice. While actively encouraging and supporting them, Cai Yanchao consulted with veteran farmers and, based on the water source and labor conditions of the entire team, suggested planting 280 mu of fields with good water sources with double-cropping late rice and replanting 330 mu of fields with relatively poor water sources prone to autumn drought with intercropped double-cropping late rice. In this way, the planting and maturity period of intercropped late rice would be earlier, which could not only avoid the midsummer drought but also stagger the seasons, and the area of double-cropping rice would not be reduced. The cadres and commune members accepted his opinion, and as a result, each season of rice was well planted and well managed, and a double-cropping harvest was obtained.

The cadres transferred to mountainous and low-yield areas also regarded leading the masses to increase grain yields as the center of their work. The Jinggangshan area is high and cold, and double-cropping rice was rarely planted in the past. The downward-transferred cadres summarized the local farmers' farming experience and led the masses to take measures such as opening ditches around the mountains to drain cold water, removing weeds on the edge of the mountains to increase sunshine, and accumulating warm fertilizer to expand the planting of double-cropping rice. In the spring, the early rice seedlings were attacked by cold waves. The downward-transferred cadres and commune members worked together, braving the cold wind and frost, and used methods such as burning fire to produce smoke and irrigating fields with warm water to protect the seedlings, so that the area of double-cropping rice in the entire region expanded to more than 65,000 mu and a bumper harvest was obtained. More than 200 cadres transferred to Dongxiang County, a low-yield area, worked with the masses in the fields and lived in thatched sheds, established cultivation and management points, and took measures such as deep plowing to improve the soil and processing to increase fertilizer to transform red soil low-yield fields. Wang Zhen, the county party secretary transferred to Changlin Commune, chose the famous low-yield slope "Wugang Ridge" as an experimental base, and led the commune members to conscientiously implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, promoting the transformation of low-yield fields in the entire commune, so that the yield of several thousand acres of low-yield fields in the entire commune increased greatly compared to last year.

These downward-transferred cadres work hard and deeply, standing at the forefront of the production struggle, and are loved by the broad masses. Over the past year, many of them have been rated as model cadres or red banner holders of teams, communes, and counties. According to statistics from Zixi, Wuning, Shangyou, Dongxiang and other counties alone, there are more than 1,000 downward-transferred cadres who have been rated as model cadres at all levels.

    江西下放干部作风踏实工作深入
    在实现穷队赶富队、山区赶平原等工作中作出巨大成绩
    许多人被评为模范干部或红旗手受到了广大群众的爱戴
    新华社南昌电　江西省今年下放到穷队、山区和低产地区的大批干部，紧密团结和依靠当地基层干部，与群众同甘共苦，脚踏实地，领导群众为实现穷队赶富队、山区赶平原、低产赶高产作出了巨大成绩。现在，全省的五千一百多个穷队，在当地群众、干部和下放干部一年来的共同努力下，已经有三分之一左右赶上或超过了富队的生产水平，山区和低产地区的面貌有了很大改变。
    江西省各级党委今年选派了大批有农村工作经验的优秀干部，下放到穷队、偏僻山区和低产地区，使这些地区平均每个公社、生产队都有两名到三名下放干部兼任或担任基层领导职务。他们在到达这些地区以后，都首先加强了政治领导。抚州专区下放到三百一十四个穷队、后进队的干部，普遍从三个方面来加强政治领导：一、进一步发挥党的核心领导作用，使党的组织成为贯彻党的政策的堡垒；二、充分树立贫农、下中农出身的干部的领导优势，并且召集贫农和下中农出身的社员举行座谈会，倾听基本群众的意见；三、进一步发扬民主作风，健全民主生活，重大问题通过社员讨论。资溪县下放到二十五个穷队的五十九名县级和公社党委书记一级的干部，从这三个方面加强政治领导以后，大大增强了党组织的战斗力，培养了大量贫农和下中农社员积极分子，从而使党的各项政策得到有力贯彻，群众积极性得到充分发挥。下放干部们还紧密团结和依靠当地基层干部，帮助基层干部提高政策水平，改进领导方法，充分调动和发挥他们的工作积极性。
    在加强政治领导的基础上，下放干部同当地基层干部一起，领导群众普遍开展了能不能赶富队、赶平原、赶高产，怎样赶富队、赶平原、赶高产的大讨论、大总结，宣传和推广各种先进经验，插红旗、树榜样，大大鼓舞了群众的信心。高安县五桥、村前、华林、燕溪、田南等五个山区公社，原来许多群众认为山区山高水冷，自然条件差，粮食生产不能赶平原；下放干部领导群众总结了当地的先进经验，分析了公社化以后人力、物力的有利条件，使群众改变山区面貌的信心大为增强，社员们立即向平原地区的郊区公社下战书，展开了生产竞赛。信丰县左陂公社太平大队是个穷山恶水的地方，许多人认为搞粮食生产没奔头。下放干部、公社党委书记钟崇祥亲自和大队干部一起深入总结了这个大队第一小队由公社化前年年缺粮到粮食自给有余的经验，树立了榜样，鼓起了群众干劲，决心赶上富队。
    在进行这些工作的同时，下放干部们贯彻以粮为纲的方针，因地制宜大抓生产。下放到穷队的干部根据穷队一般是粮食生产发展慢和经营项目单一的特点，发动群众大抓粮食生产和开展多种经营。资溪县高田公社里木大队过去大都只种一季，粮食不能自给。下放到这个大队担任党支部书记的干部林星辉，领导群众挖掘土地潜力，与群众一起进垅上山，因地制宜地晚稻改早稻、荒地改熟田、一季改两季，使双季稻的栽插面积比去年扩大很多。他又组织社员开展林业和副业生产，使全队不仅粮食生产大大发展，做到粮食自给有余，而且林业、副业收入也比去年增加很多，年终预分全队社员都增加了收入，成为全县穷队赶富队的标兵之一。下放到新干县善政公社穷队北坑生产队担任党支部书记的干部蔡燕朝，发动群众千方百计开荒扩种粮食作物八百多亩。当地的干部和社员干劲很大，主张再把其中的六百一十亩水田全部改种连作双季稻。蔡燕朝一面积极鼓励支持他们，一面和老农商量后，根据全队水源和劳动力等条件，建议因地制宜将二百八十亩水源好的田插双季连作晚稻，将三百三十亩水源较差易受秋旱的田改插间作双季晚稻，这样间作晚稻栽插和成熟期较早，既可以躲过伏旱，又可以错开季节，双季稻面积也不减少。干部和社员们接受了他的意见，结果季季水稻都种得好、管得好，获得了双季丰收。
    下放山区、低产地区的干部，也把领导群众提高粮食产量作为工作的中心。井冈山地区山高水冷，过去很少种双季稻。下放干部总结了当地农民的耕作经验，领导群众采取环山开沟排除冷水，铲除山边杂草增加日晒，以及积造暖性肥料等办法，扩种双季稻。春季，早稻秧苗受到寒潮侵袭，下放干部们和社员一起，顶寒风，冒霜冻，用烧火熏烟、温水灌田等方法保住了禾苗，使全区双季稻的面积扩展到六万五千多亩，并且获得了丰收。下放到低产区东乡县的二百多名干部，同群众一起下田间、住茅棚，建立耕作管理点，采取深耕改土加工加肥等措施改造红壤低产田。下放到长林公社的县委书记王珍，选择有名的低产坂“乌岗岭”作为试验基地，带领社员认真贯彻农业“八字宪法”，推动了全社的低产田改造工作，使全社数千亩低产田的产量比去年增长很多。
    这些下放干部工作艰苦深入，在生产斗争中站在最前列，受到了广大群众的爱戴。一年来，他们中许多人被评为队、社、县的模范干部或红旗手。仅据资溪、武宁、上犹、东乡等县的统计，被评为各级模范干部的下放干部就有一千多名。（附图片）
