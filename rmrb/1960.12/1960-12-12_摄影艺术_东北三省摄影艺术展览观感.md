Impressions of the Photographic Art Exhibition of the Three Northeast Provinces
Wu Yin-xian

The Photographic Art Exhibition of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang Provinces is being held in Beijing. It reflects the great victories achieved by the people of the three northeastern provinces under the inspiration of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune's three red flags. The one hundred and ninety-four works on display reflect the spirit of struggle of the Chinese people in transforming society and nature; depict the great era of our country; profoundly portray the revolutionary spirit of the people striving for strength and working hard under the guidance of the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor in our socialist construction; and outline the beautiful picture of social life in our country.

Most of the exhibited works focus on reflecting industrial and agricultural production. They vividly and prominently reflect the industrial and agricultural features of Northeast China through photographic art. Among them, such works as "Steelmaking Expert - Li Shaokui" (photographed by Tian Yuan) and "Folk Expert - Zhang Xijiu" (photographed by Jin Duo) depict the images of heroic figures of our times from various aspects. Among them, the image shaping of Li Shaokui is particularly successful. The author portrays Li Shaokui's firm and unyielding spirit. This kind of character depiction represents the typical image of Chinese workers.

This photo exhibition is an example of the flourishing of photographic art creation in our country after the Third National Congress of Literary and Art Workers.

From the exhibited works, we have seen that the three northeastern provinces have very rich photographic potential, and this potential is constantly being developed; at the same time, we have also seen the hard work and excellent achievements made by photographers in these three provinces under the leadership of the Party, serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers with photography. We wish them continued and unremitting efforts to continuously leap forward in China's photographic art. (Photos attached)

    摄影艺术
    东北三省摄影艺术展览观感
    吴印咸
    辽宁、吉林、黑龙江三省摄影艺术展览在北京展出了。它反映了东北三省人民在党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗鼓舞下所取得的巨大胜利。展出的一百九十四幅作品，反映了我国人民改造社会、改造自然的斗争精神；表现了我国伟大的时代面貌；深刻地描绘了我国社会主义建设事业中，在以农业为基础，以工业为主导的方针指导下，人民发愤图强、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，勾画出了我国社会美丽的生活图画。
    展出的作品大多数是以反映工农业生产为主题的。它们都是通过摄影造型艺术鲜明而突出地反映了祖国东北的工农业面貌。其中如《炼钢能手——李绍奎》（田原摄）、《土专家——张锡久》（金铎摄）等，则又是从各个方面描写了我们时代的英雄人物形象。其中尤以李绍奎的形象塑造最为成功。作者刻划了李绍奎坚强不屈的精神面貌。这种性格的描绘，表现了中国工人的典型形象。
    这个影展，是我国第三次文代大会以后，摄影艺术创作走向繁荣的一例。
    从展出的作品中，我们看到了东北三省蕴藏着非常丰富的摄影潜力，而这些潜力正在不断地发挥出来；同时我们也看到了这三个省的摄影工作者在党的领导下，在用摄影为工农兵群众服务中付出的辛勤劳动和获得的优良成绩。祝他们继续不懈地努力，使我国的摄影艺术持续跃进。（附图片）
