Xinhua News Agency, Jinan - The Mengyin County Processing Plant in Shandong Province comprehensively utilizes wild raw materials to produce a large quantity of inexpensive and good-quality daily necessities such as soap and caustic soda, and extracts products such as potassium carbonate, potassium chloride, and potassium sulfate.

In the past two years, workers at this small factory have used thyme, thatch, bean stalks, sesame stalks, sunflower stalks, wheat stalks, and sorghum stalks as raw materials to produce more than 150 kinds of products. Thyme (called mosquito grass by the masses) used to be mainly used to repel mosquitoes in the summer. Now, the factory uses it to make aromatic oil, and the residue is made into feed. The products are inexpensive and of good quality, and are very popular among the masses.

In vigorously developing the comprehensive utilization of wild plants, factory leaders and workers have jointly carried out technical innovations, repeatedly studied and solved a series of problems.

    蒙阴加工厂
    用野生原料制造日用品
    据新华社济南电　山东蒙阴县加工厂综合利用野生原料，制成大批肥皂、火碱等物美价廉的日用品，并提炼出碳酸钾、氯化钾、硫酸钾等产品。
    两年来，这家小工厂的工人已经利用百里香草、茅草、豆秸、芝麻秸、向日葵秸、麦秸、高粱秸等作原料，生产了一百五十多种产品。百里香草（群众叫蚊子草），过去最大的用处是人们在夏天用它熏蚊子。现在，厂里用它做成了芳香油，渣子做成了饲料。产品价廉物美，很受群众欢迎。
    在大搞野生植物综合利用中，工厂领导干部和工人一起大闹技术革新，反复钻研，解决了一系列的问题。
