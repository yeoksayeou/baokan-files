Xinhua News Agency, Havana, December 3rd: Ben Bella, head of the Algerian delegation currently visiting Latin America, said in Havana yesterday evening that the United States is preventing the Algerian people from achieving liberation. However, the Algerian people are determined to continue the struggle until they win independence.

Ben Bella said in a television broadcast that "the United States government has not remained neutral in the Algerian war of independence, but like other members of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization, has provided assistance to France in order to continue the war, and has allowed France to use the equipment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, from every weapon to aircraft and warships, to oppose our people." He also pointed out that the United States also "guarantees France's daily war expenditure of six million dollars economically."

Ben Bella condemned De Gaulle's plan to establish an "Algerian Republic" as "a conspiracy to establish a puppet government. We believe that De Gaulle's desire for peace in Algeria is insincere, because he has always hoped to achieve a military victory that he will never obtain." Ben Bella said that the Algerian people are determined to continue their struggle until they win independence.

In response to a question about how the Algerian people would respond if France used atomic bombs against them, Ben Bella said, "France has already detonated two experimental atomic bombs in the Algerian desert, and the Algerian National Liberation Front's response has been to carry out activities on an even larger scale." He said that France's detonation of atomic bombs has attracted the attention of the people of other African countries, further strengthening anti-colonialist activities and the determination to fight for independence.

Ben Bella then said that the Algerian delegation has confirmed during this visit to Latin America that there is a very deep anti-imperialist sentiment among the Latin American people. He also said that the people of Latin America are very concerned about the experience currently developing in Cuba.

The Algerian delegation arrived in Cuba on November 26th. The delegation has visited cooperatives and factories in Oriente Province and Pinar del Río Province, and has attended various mass rallies, receiving a warm welcome from the Cuban people.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 2nd: The "Voice of the Algerian Republic" radio station broadcast here tonight that the Algerian armed struggle will continue until French imperialism succumbs to the Algerian people's right to full freedom and independence.

The radio station said: On the eve of the United Nations debate on the Algerian issue, French imperialism fabricated and heavily promoted so-called "Algeria for Algerians," "referendum," and other deceptive schemes and plans, attempting to divert world public opinion and deceive public opinion in order to continue its imperialist war in Algeria.

The radio station emphasized: All the conspiracies and tricks of the French government cannot deceive world public opinion.

    本赫达在哈瓦那发表广播演说
    谴责美国阻挠阿尔及利亚独立
    指出在访问中看到拉丁美洲人民有着极深刻的反帝情绪
    新华社哈瓦那3日电　正在拉丁美洲访问的阿尔及利亚代表团团长本赫达昨天晚上在哈瓦那说，美国正阻止阿尔及利亚人民取得解放。但是阿尔及利亚人民决心继续斗争，直到赢得独立。
    本赫达在电视广播中说，“美国政府在阿尔及利亚的独立战争中并没有保持中立，而是像侵略性的北大西洋公约集团的其他成员国一样，向法国提供援助，以便继续进行战争，并且允许法国利用北大西洋公约组织的装备，从每件武器直到飞机和战舰来反对我国人民。”他还指出，美国还在经济上“保证着法国每天在战争中花费的六百万美元的开支。”
    本赫达谴责说，戴高乐的建立“阿尔及利亚共和国”的计划，“是建立傀儡政府的阴谋。我们认为戴高乐对阿尔及利亚的和平的愿望是不真诚的，因为他一直希望取得他永远得不到的军事胜利。”本赫达说，阿尔及利亚人民决心继续进行斗争，直到赢得独立为止。
    本赫达在答复如果法国使用原子弹来对付阿尔及利亚人时阿尔及利亚人民将如何回答时的问题时说，“法国已经在阿尔及利亚的沙漠地区爆炸了两枚试验性的原子弹，阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线对它所做的回答是更大规模地开展活动。”他说，法国爆炸原子弹已经引起了非洲其他各国人民的注意，更加加强了反殖民主义的活动和坚决为争取独立而斗争。
    本赫达接着说，阿尔及利亚代表团在这次对拉丁美洲的访问中证实了拉丁美洲人民存在着极深刻的反对帝国主义的感情。他还说，拉丁美洲的人民非常关心目前在古巴发展着的经验。
    阿尔及利亚代表团是在11月26日抵达古巴的。代表团已经参观了奥连特省和比那尔德里奥省的合作社和工厂，并且出席了各种群众集会，受到了古巴人民的热情接待。
    新华社开罗2日电　《阿尔及利亚共和国之声》电台今晚在这里广播说：阿尔及利亚的武装斗争将继续进行下去，直到法帝国主义向阿尔及利亚人民享有完全的自由和独立的权利屈服。
    电台说：在联合国就阿尔及利亚问题进行辩论的前夕，法国帝国主义制造了所谓“阿尔及利亚人的阿尔及利亚”、“公民投票”等等故弄玄虚的方案和计划，并大肆渲染，企图以此来转移世界舆论的视线，欺骗公众舆论，以达到它继续在阿尔及利亚进行它的帝国主义战争的目的。
    电台着重指出：法国政府的一切阴谋诡计都欺骗不了世界公众舆论。
