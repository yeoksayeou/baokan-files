    Helping Rural Areas Design Simple Tractor Repair Equipment
    Jilin University of Technology, combining teaching and scientific research, is helping rural areas design a complete set of simple tractor repair equipment, testing equipment, and main disassembly tools.
    The design work for these agricultural machinery repair and testing equipment was undertaken after thorough practical investigation and research. The designed items all have the advantages of simple structure, convenient manufacturing, and easy operation, which can ensure repair quality and testing accuracy.
    In accordance with the needs of the new situation of accelerating agricultural mechanization, Jilin University of Technology has also decided to establish a tractor repair technology major, which, together with the original tractor manufacturing and agricultural machinery manufacturing majors, will form a "one-stop" professional teaching system for agricultural machinery design, manufacturing, and repair technology.
    Conducting Crop Pest and Disease Surveys and Prevention Activities
    The Department of Biology of Central China Normal University organized more than 110 teachers and students to cooperate with relevant departments in conducting crop pest and disease surveys and prevention work in the three regions of Enshi, Xiangyang, and Huanggang.
    The pest and disease survey team in Enshi Prefecture, in more than two months, cooperated with the local area to complete a survey area of approximately 2 million mu and a prevention area of more than 425,300 mu; trained more than 14,000 temporary prevention technicians and nearly 1,000 professional technicians for the local area, and enabled these people to reach the level of "five abilities" personnel, that is, they are both workers, surveyors, preventers, propagandists, and forecasters.
    Establishing Party Organizations in Rural Canteens
    In order to strengthen the Party's leadership over rural public canteens, the CPC Fushan County Committee in Shanxi Province actively established Party organizations in the canteens. Since October, the county party committee has drawn 573 party cadres from the county, communes, management areas, and production teams to serve as or concurrently serve as stewards, cooks, and administrators in the canteens. At present, 297 canteens in the county have established Party groups. After the establishment of Party organizations in the canteens, not only has the lives of the masses been improved and production promoted, but also the work style of cadres has been further improved.
    Laocheng Commune Runs Party Training Classes
    The Laocheng Commune Party Committee of Songzi County, Hubei Province, has achieved remarkable results in strengthening the political and ideological education of new Party members through Party training classes.
    Since the training class started in June, the Party committee has collectively studied and reviewed the teaching content, and directly participated in giving lectures and making reports. Up to now, a total of five classes have been trained, training 479 rural party members and activists.
    Warmly Caring for the Lives of Fishermen
    Party organizations at all levels in the Liuheng Commune of Zhoushan County, Zhejiang Province, warmly care for the lives of fishermen at sea, and do everything possible to organize a large number of vegetables and non-staple foods to be transported to the fishing grounds. The more the leaders care about the lives of the commune members, the higher the commune members' enthusiasm for production. They gratefully wrote big-character posters saying: "The Party committee takes care very thoughtfully, the commune members' enthusiasm soars to the sky, they work diligently to produce beyond the target, and make achievements to report the good news."
