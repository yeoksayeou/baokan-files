Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, December 6th: The "Cambodia Telegraph" strongly condemned the United States for interfering in Laos' internal affairs on the 6th. It pointed out: "If the United States and its allies and servants had allowed the Lao people to solve their own problems, the Lao crisis would not have occurred or would have already been resolved."

The newspaper condemned the United States for recognizing the Phouma government on the one hand, and undermining it on the other. The newspaper pointed out that the United States and its allies have done everything possible to help the Phoumi Nosavan group through various means. They not only provided the Phoumi group with weapons, ammunition, artillery and aircraft, but also continuously transported weapons, ammunition and various equipment from Bangkok and Manila to Luang Prabang and Savannakhet on the airline's planes. Helicopters piloted by Southeast Asia Treaty Organization officers directed the Phoumi group's artillery fire. Mortars and artillery based on Thai territory bombarded the defense facilities of the Lao Royal Government. The US Navy is also prepared to "land when the situation becomes serious."

The newspaper said that international public opinion can no longer ignore this. If the Phoumi group's conspiracy succeeds, then the countries of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization will then launch attacks on the governments of some neutral countries. Neutral Cambodia will face serious threats.

Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh: Cambodian National Radio accused the United States on the 5th of instigating the Nosavan group to hold the King of Laos hostage and preparing to establish another "new Lao government" run by their own people, in order to introduce intervention by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and pave the way for the armed intervention of the US Seventh Fleet, which is cruising near the South China Sea.

The "Cambodia Telegraph" quoted Max Clos, a special correspondent for the French newspaper "Le Figaro" who had recently visited Laos, in a commentary on the 3rd. The French reporter said: In the past, "In Laos, everything depended on the United States, and it took care of the formation and dissolution of the government. It can even be said that the de facto government of Laos is the US Embassy." He said, "The remarkable shift of certain people towards the Phoumi Nosavan group recently is the result of (American) cunning application of dollars." The newspaper then said, "All this is disgusting. All this is regrettable. It is shameful to use such means."

    柬埔寨国家电台和报纸发表评论
    揭露美国猖狂干涉老挝内政
    新华社金边6日电　《柬埔寨电讯报》6日强烈谴责美国干涉老挝内政。它指出：“如果美国以及它的盟国和仆从们让老挝人解决他们自己的事情，那么老挝危机本来就不会发生或者已经解决。”
    这家报纸谴责美国一面承认富马政府、一面又去破坏富马政府。报纸指出，美国及其盟国竭尽所能通过各种办法帮助富米·诺萨万集团。它们不仅向富米集团提供武器、弹药、大炮和飞机，而且还向这个航空公司的飞机不断把来自曼谷和马尼拉的武器、弹药和各种装备运到琅勃拉邦和沙湾拿吉。由东南亚条约组织的军官驾驶的直升飞机指挥着富米集团的炮兵射击。设在泰国领土上的迫击炮和大炮轰击了老挝王国政府的防御设施。美国的海军还准备“在局势严重时登陆”。
    报纸说，国际舆论不能再置之不理。如果富米集团的阴谋一旦得逞，那么东南亚条约组织各国就将继而向一些中立国家的政府发动进攻。中立的柬埔寨就将面临严重的威胁。
    据新华社金边讯　柬埔寨国家电台5日指责美国煽动诺萨万集团挟持老挝国王，并准备成立由他们自己的人主持的另一个“新的老挝政府”；以便通过它引进东南亚条约组织的干涉，并为正在南中国海附近海面游弋的美国第七舰队的武装干涉铺平道路。
    《柬埔寨电讯报》3日在一篇评论中引证了不久前访问过老挝的法国《费加罗报》特派记者马克斯·克洛的话。这个法国记者说：过去，“在老挝，一切取决于美国，政府的组成和解散都是它包办的。甚至可以说，老挝的实际上的政府是美国大使馆。”他说，“最近某些人令人注目地倒向富米·诺萨万集团，这是由于（美国）狡猾地施给美元的结果。”报纸接着说，“这一切都是令人憎恶的。这一切都是令人遗憾的。使用这种手段是可耻的。”
