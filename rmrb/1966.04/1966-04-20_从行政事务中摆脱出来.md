　　As a rural Party branch secretary, where should the focus of work be placed? I say we must grasp the major issues and should not take on all administrative affairs. This is my experience.
　　When I first started working as the branch secretary, I was very enthusiastic and wanted to do a good job. I thought, as the branch secretary, I should have comprehensive control over the work. Because of this kind of thinking, I managed everything and personally stepped forward in everything. Because I grabbed at work randomly and managed everything, I ignored the major issues, that is, I neglected doing people's ideological work well. As a result, some people went astray. After the commune Party committee discovered these problems and talked to me, I still felt it was sudden and unexpected.
　　I put in a lot of effort, but the work was still not done well. What was the reason? Later, through studying Chairman Mao's works, I gradually realized that the reason why the work was not done well was because I took on too many administrative affairs and did not grasp the helm.
　　From then on, I reversed the practice of taking on all administrative affairs and paid attention to grasping the major issues, grasping the issues of direction, and grasping the implementation of the Party's policies and guidelines. The branch committee members also had clear divisions of labor, and each person took on the work assigned to them. Major issues were collectively discussed at the branch committee meeting. In this way, the work went smoothly and was grasped proactively. After breaking free from administrative affairs, I was able to concentrate my energy on doing ideological work, and the work was done more solidly. Last spring, we had a severe spring drought, and a small portion of the land had missing seedlings and broken rows. Some people were resistant to checking the fields and replanting seedlings, believing that the seedlings were growing well and that missing a small amount would not affect the year's harvest. We seized on this ideological tendency and conducted an analysis and study at the branch committee meeting. Everyone believed that this was a kind of blind optimism. We eliminated the commune members' blind optimism by summarizing past experiences and lessons, and doing thorough and meticulous ideological work. Then, the branch committee members took the lead in leading the commune members to replant. After three days of hard work, all the plots of land with missing seedlings and broken rows in the entire brigade were replanted.
　　Facts show that to do the work of a branch secretary, it is necessary to grasp ideological work and treat highlighting politics as the top priority. If it is not done this way, grabbing at everything, it is impossible to do the work well.

    从行政事务中摆脱出来
    黑龙江肇东县五站公社高卜大队党支部书记　张林
    作为一个农村党支部书记，应该把工作重点放在什么地方？我说必须抓好重大的问题，不应包揽行政事务。这是我的一点体会。
    我刚做支部书记工作时，劲头很足，一心想把工作干好。我想，自己是支部书记，工作应该管得全面一些。正因有这种想法，什么工作都管，样样亲自出头。由于自己工作乱抓，事事都管，就把重大问题忽略了，也就是把做好人的思想工作忽略了，结果有些人走上了歪道。公社党委发现这些问题之后，和我一说，我还感到突如其来。
    劲没少费，工作还没搞好，是什么原因呢？后来，通过学习毛主席著作，自己才逐渐认识到工作所以没干好，就是因为包揽行政事务过多，没有掌握住舵。
    从此，我扭转了包揽行政事务的做法，注意抓重大问题，抓方向性问题，抓党的方针政策的贯彻。支部委员还做了明确的分工，各人都把分工的工作担负起来，重大问题在支委会上集体讨论，这样，工作顺手了，抓的也主动了。摆脱行政事务之后，我就能集中精力做思想工作了，工作也做得更扎实了。去年春天，我们这里发生了严重的春旱，有一小部分地块发生了缺苗断条现象。有些人对查田补苗存有抵触情绪，认为苗长得好，缺一星半点的也不影响年成。我们抓住这种思想苗头，在支委会上进行了分析研究，大家认为这是一种盲目乐观情绪。我们通过总结过去的经验教训，做一番深入细致的思想工作，消除了社员的盲目乐观情绪，然后支部委员带头领着社员补种。经过三天时间的奋战，全大队缺苗断条的地块都补种上了。
    事实说明，做支部书记工作，一定要抓思想工作，把突出政治当作头等大事去抓。如果不是这样，眉毛胡子一把抓，工作是不可能做好的。
