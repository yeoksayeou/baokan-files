    In 1959, our county's men's and women's basketball teams visited several counties for matches and won every game. At first, everyone was conscientious and performed well. However, during the last game, the individualistic thoughts of the athletes were exposed, and their arrogance began to show. They argued with each other about who deserved the credit, and the players on the court felt they were being treated the same as those on the bench, which they considered unfair. At the time, I thought, "It's the last game anyway, let's not make things too tense, it's not good to harm the harmony." Therefore, I didn't conduct the necessary ideological education. "A thousand-mile dike is destroyed by an ant hole." From then on, the team quickly went downhill. They thought they played well and deserved more attention. They also believed that they were playing for the County Sports Committee, and as long as they played well, they would be popular, without the word "politics" in their minds. The coach even openly said to me: "I'm in charge of technique, you're in charge of politics. If there's a problem, we'll call you, and you can come." How could they play with style and skill in the matches under such circumstances? How could they play well? When they lost, they blamed the venue, the referees, the weather, and even the fact that the uniforms were too old, etc.
    In 1964, the prefectural preliminary competition was held in our county. Although we had trained some new players, we still had championship-ism in our heads, and we called the old athletes to play during the competition. They didn't perform well, and the masses angrily said: "Losing the game doesn't matter, but we can't lose our character!" The county Party committee pointed out sharply that this was a reflection of class struggle in the sports team. From then on, we were determined to highlight politics. From the second half of 1964, we launched a discussion in the team on "For Whom Do We Play?" During the discussion, everyone presented their problems, expressed their thoughts, and criticized and helped each other. Both new and old players were shocked and realized the danger of this style of work developing. By studying articles such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People," they raised their awareness. They said that they had clarified that playing is for the revolution, they didn't feel hot in the sun, and they didn't feel pain in their bodies. From then on, they pooled their wisdom and efforts in the competition, were quick and brave, and were able to perform their techniques normally, and naturally achieved good results. Last year, in the competition of fourteen teams in the prefecture, the men's team rose from the second to last place in 1959 to seventh place. The women's team ranked first among ten teams.
    These experiences and lessons have taught us: 1. If athletes want to play well, they must highlight politics, earnestly study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, transform their subjective world, and establish the idea of "playing for the revolution." 2. Leading cadres must set an example and check themselves first when there are problems. 3. We must often grasp the athletes' living thoughts. We cannot ignore them because there are no competitions. We must go to their units to understand them and help them. 4. We must never engage in championship-ism or material incentives. In that case, even if we achieve some results, it will only be a flash in the pan. Only when people's ideology is revolutionized can the achievements be continuously consolidated and improved.

    不能让资产阶级思想乘虚而入
    一九五九年，我们县男女篮球代表队，到一些县去访问比赛，场场获胜。开始时，大家兢兢业业，表现较好。到最后一场时，运动员中的个人主义思想暴露了，骄傲情绪露头，彼此争功，闹意见，上场队员认为自己和场下队员一样待遇，吃了亏。当时我想，反正最后一场了，不要搞得紧紧张张的，伤了和气不好，因此没有进行必要的思想教育。“千里之堤，溃于一穴”，从此，这个球队就迅速朝下坡路跑。他们认为自己球打得不错，应该得到更多的照顾。还认为，球是为县体委打的，只要打好球，就吃香，脑子里没有“政治”两字。教练员也公然对我说：“搞技术归我，政治归你，出了问题，我们叫你，你再来。”这样，比赛中哪能打出风格，赛出水平？哪能比赛得好？输了就怪场地、裁判、天气，甚至怪服装太旧等等。
    一九六四年，专区分区赛在我县举行，我们虽也培养了些新手，但自己脑袋瓜有锦标主义思想，临比赛时，仍叫那些老运动员上场。他们表现得不够好，群众生气地说：“输了球不要紧，可不能输了人！”县委一针见血地指出，这是阶级斗争在体育队伍中的反映。从此，我们下决心突出政治，从一九六四年下半年起，在球队中展开了“为谁打球？”的讨论。讨论中大家摆问题，亮思想，互相批评帮助，新老队员都大吃一惊，认识到这种作风发展下去的危险性；又通过学习《纪念白求恩》、《为人民服务》等文章，提高了觉悟。他们说，明确了打球是为革命，太阳晒也不觉热，身上痛也不觉苦。从此，比赛中群策群力，快速勇猛，技术都能正常发挥，很自然地取得了较好的比赛成绩。去年男队在专区十四个队的比赛中，由一九五九年来的倒数第二名升到第七名。女队在十个队中名列第一。
    以上这些经验教训，使我们懂得了：一、运动员要想打好球，必须突出政治，认真活学活用毛主席著作，改造主观世界，确立“为革命打球”的思想。二、领导干部要以身作则，有问题首先检查自己。三、经常抓运动员的活思想，不能因为没比赛，丢开不管，要深入到他所在的单位去了解他，帮助他。四、决不能搞锦标主义、搞物质刺激，那样，即便出点成绩，也只是昙花一现。只有人的思想革命化了，成绩才能不断巩固上升。
