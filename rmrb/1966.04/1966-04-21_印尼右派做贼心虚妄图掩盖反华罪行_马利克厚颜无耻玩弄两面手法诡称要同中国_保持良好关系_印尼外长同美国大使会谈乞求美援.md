    Xinhua News Agency, April 20th Dispatch from Jakarta: Indonesian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Adam Malik once again played his two-faced trick of feigned friendship and genuine anti-China stance on the 18th. According to Antara News Agency, when answering reporters' questions, he said that Indonesia "still hopes to maintain good relations with People's China" and "he guaranteed that the Indonesian government will continue to protect the safety of overseas Chinese residing in Indonesia and the Chinese Embassy in Jakarta from any irresponsible actions." However, he then attributed the fascist atrocities of attacking the Chinese Embassy, directly organized and directed by the Indonesian government, to "people's anger" and described them as "natural." The fact that Malik openly defended this notorious fascist atrocity completely exposed what he meant by hoping to maintain "good relations" with China. The day after Malik made this statement, Indonesian right-wing thugs attacked, vandalized, and seized the Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta again.
    Prior to this, in the bloody incident on April 15th, when the Indonesian government organized armed military police and thugs to attack the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, Malik also played this trick of feigned friendship and genuine anti-China stance. Malik, as Deputy Prime Minister, not only sent a representative to attend the anti-China mobilization rally organized by the Indonesian right-wing military regime in Banteng Square in Jakarta, but also delivered a "written congratulatory message" to the rally, inciting anti-China sentiment. However, after the Indonesian armed military police and thugs staged the fascist atrocity of attacking the Chinese Embassy, Malik hypocritically went to the scene of the Chinese Embassy and reached out to shake hands with Chinese diplomatic officials. Only when the Chinese diplomatic officials made solemn protests and questioned Malik did he have no words to respond and left in embarrassment. The next day, Malik received the thugs who attacked the Chinese Embassy and expressed his appreciation for the thugs' so-called "determination to be loyal to Indonesia."
    Malik's actions fully exposed his shameless and two-faced nature.
    Xinhua News Agency, April 20th Dispatch from Jakarta: Indonesian Foreign Minister Adam Malik met with US Ambassador to Indonesia, Green, on the 18th to beg the United States for "aid."
    According to Jakarta Radio and Western news agencies, Malik held "friendly talks" with Green on the relations between Indonesia and the United States and discussed the economic difficulties currently faced by the Indonesian government. A UPI report on the meeting revealed that the main content of Malik's meeting with Green was to request "aid" from the United States to cope with the serious economic problems it faces. It said that the Indonesian "new regime will eventually need US help to cope with the current demand for rice and to reschedule debt repayment plans, and perhaps provide interest-free loans urgently needed to remedy the country's ruined economy."

    印尼右派做贼心虚妄图掩盖反华罪行
    马利克厚颜无耻玩弄两面手法诡称要同中国“保持良好关系”
    印尼外长同美国大使会谈乞求美援
    新华社二十日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚内阁副总理兼外交部长阿丹姆·马利克在十八日又一次玩弄他的假友好、真反华的两面派手法。据安塔拉通讯社报道，他在回答记者的问题时，说什么印度尼西亚“仍然希望同人民中国保持良好关系”，“他保证印度尼西亚政府将继续保护旅居印度尼西亚的华侨和中国驻雅加达大使馆的安全，使他们不受任何不负责任的行动的侵犯。”但是，他接着把由印度尼西亚政府直接组织和指挥的袭击中国大使馆的法西斯暴行，说成是由于“人民愤怒情绪”，“是自然的”。马利克公然为这个臭名远扬的法西斯暴行辩护的事实，彻底揭穿了他的所谓希望同中国保持“良好关系”，究竟是什么东西。就在马利克发表这个讲话的第二天，印度尼西亚右派暴徒又袭击、破坏并强占了中国驻雅加达总领事馆。
    在这之前，在四月十五日印度尼西亚政府组织武装军警和暴徒袭击中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆的血腥事件中，马利克也曾玩弄过这种假友好、真反华的伎俩。身为内阁副总理的马利克，不仅派代表出席了在雅加达雄牛广场上举行的由印度尼西亚右派军人政权组织的反华动员大会，并且向大会发表了一个煽动反华的“书面贺词”。但是，在会后印度尼西亚武装军警伙同暴徒演出了袭击中国大使馆的法西斯暴行之后，马利克又装模作样地跑到中国大使馆现场，伸手要同中国外交官员握手。只是在中国外交官员义正词严地向马利克提出抗议和质问的时候，马利克才无词可对，狼狈退走。第二天，马利克又接见了袭击中国大使馆的暴徒，并且对暴徒们所谓“忠于印度尼西亚的决心”，表示赞赏。
    马利克的这些行径，充分暴露了他的厚颜无耻和两面派面目。
    据新华社二十日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚外交部长阿丹姆·马利克十八日同美国驻印度尼西亚大使格林举行会谈，向美国乞讨“援助”。
    据雅加达电台和西方通讯社报道，马利克同格林就印度尼西亚同美国之间的关系进行了“友好的会谈”，并且讨论了印度尼西亚政府当前面临的经济困难。合众国际社报道这次会谈的消息透露，马利克同格林会谈的主要内容是要求美国给予“援助”，来应付它面临的严重经济问题。它说，印度尼西亚“新政权终将需要美国的帮助来应付当前对大米的需求以及重新安排还债的计划，也许还需提供补救这个国家破坏了的经济所急需的无息贷款。”
