    Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, March 30th. Vice Premier and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China, Chen Yi, spoke at a civic reception in Karachi on the 30th. The full text is as follows: Respected Foreign Minister Bhutto, Respected Deputy Chairman Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq, Dear Friends:
    Last year, President Ayub Khan visited China, and we thank him for bringing the deep affection of the Pakistani people to the Chinese people. Now, Chairman Liu Shaoqi has come to Pakistan for a visit and has personally received a warm and cordial welcome from the Pakistani people. We are deeply moved. These days, we live among the Pakistani people as if we were living in our own home. We received inspiring welcomes in Rawalpindi and Lahore. Today, as we arrived here, the people of Karachi cheered for Sino-Pakistani friendship. Now, the Karachi Municipal Committee is holding such a grand reception to welcome us. On behalf of Chairman Liu Shaoqi and all comrades, I express my heartfelt thanks to the friends present and, through you, to all the people of Karachi. Karachi is Pakistan's largest industrial and commercial city and a famous port. Karachi plays a pivotal role in the friendly exchanges and economic trade between China and Pakistan. The Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition is currently being held in your city. Tens of thousands of people visit every day, fully demonstrating the Pakistani people's friendship towards China. We are pleased to see that the trade between the two countries has increased several times in recent years, and economic cooperation has been rapidly strengthened. The economic and trade relations between our two countries are built on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, exchange of needed goods, and mutual support. This relationship is conducive to the development of our respective national economies, enabling us to more effectively resist imperialist exploitation, plunder, and control. We believe that the economic and trade relations between the two countries have broad prospects for development.
    Dear friends, we have come to visit you with the Chinese people's desire for permanent friendship with the Pakistani people. This desire has resonated strongly with the Pakistani people. There is a Chinese saying, "A long road tests a horse's strength; time reveals a person's heart." The friendship between our two peoples has been tested by adversity and has proven to be strong and reliable. When Pakistan was subjected to armed aggression by India, the Chinese people stood firmly on the side of the Pakistani people. On the issue of resolving the Kashmir issue, the Chinese people have always supported Pakistan's just position. The Pakistani government and people have made a correct assessment of this, and we express our gratitude. Dear friends, the Chinese people will not forget the support given to us by the Pakistani government and people in international affairs. This mutual support is a reliable foundation for the deep friendship between our two peoples.
    Tomorrow, we will end our visit to West Pakistan. On the eve of our departure, I would like to once again assure the Pakistani people that in your struggle to safeguard national independence and oppose foreign interference and aggression, the 650 million Chinese people will always be your most reliable friends.
    Qin—Pakistan Ni—Dosti—Zindabad! (Long live China-Pakistan friendship!)

    新华社卡拉奇三十日电  中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼外交部长陈毅三十日在卡拉奇市民招待会上讲话，全文如下：尊敬的布托外长阁下，尊敬的穆罕默德·齐乌拉·汗副主席阁下，亲爱的朋友们：
    去年，阿尤布·汗总统阁下访问了中国，我们感谢他给中国人民带来了巴基斯坦人民的深情厚意，现在，刘少奇主席前来巴基斯坦访问，又亲自受到了巴基斯坦人民的热情而亲切的欢迎，我们深为感动。这几天，我们生活在巴基斯坦人民中间，就好象生活在自己家里一样。我们在拉瓦尔品第、在拉合尔，受到激动人心的欢迎，今天，当我们到达这里的时候，卡拉奇人民向我们发出了歌颂中巴友谊的欢呼。现在，卡拉奇市政委员会又举行这样盛大的招待会欢迎我们。我代表刘少奇主席和全体同志们，向在座的朋友们，并且通过你们，向全体卡拉奇人民表示衷心的感谢。卡拉奇是巴基斯坦最大的工商业城市和著名的港口。在中巴两国友好往来和经济贸易方面，卡拉奇起着枢纽的作用。现在中国经济贸易展览会就正在你们的城市举行。每天都有几万人来参观，充分表现了巴基斯坦人民对中国的友情。我们高兴地看到，近年来两国的贸易成倍地增长，经济合作迅速地加强。我们两国的经济贸易关系是建筑在平等互利、互通有无、相互支援的基础上的。这种关系有利于发展我们各自的民族经济，使我们能够更有效地抵制帝国主义的剥削、掠夺和控制。我们相信，两国的经济贸易关系有着广阔的发展前途。
    亲爱的朋友们，我们带着中国人民同巴基斯坦人民永久友好的愿望来访问你们。这种愿望在巴基斯坦人民这里得到了强烈的共鸣。中国有一句成语说，“路遥知马力，日久见人心”。我们两国人民的友谊正是这样地经过患难的考验，证明是坚强可靠的。当巴基斯坦遭到印度武装进攻的时候，中国人民坚决站在巴基斯坦人民一边。在解决克什米尔问题上，中国人民一贯支持巴基斯坦的正义立场。巴基斯坦政府和人民，对此作出了正确的评价，我们表示感谢。亲爱的朋友们，中国人民也不会忘记巴基斯坦政府和人民在国际事务中所给予我们的支持。这种互相支持，是我们两国人民深厚友谊可靠的基础。
    明天，我们要结束在西巴基斯坦的访问。在离别的前夕，我愿意向巴基斯坦人民再一次保证：在你们维护民族独立、反对外来干涉和侵略的斗争中，六亿五千万中国人民将永远是你们最可靠的朋友。
    秦——巴基斯坦尼——多斯底——金达巴！（中巴友好万岁！）
