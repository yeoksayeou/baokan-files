    Recently, commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a forum to severely criticize Comrade Wu Han's "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office." The following are excerpts from some of the speeches.

    What is Comrade Wu Han singing? What is he scolding?
    Wang Chengyi

    In "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," Comrade Wu Han loudly sings that Hai Rui, the political representative of the landlord class, is a people's "savior" who "avenges the people." In essence, he is using the name of Hai Rui to sing that the big landlords, big bureaucrats, and right-wing opportunists are the people's "savior." Let us look at the historical truth. I come from a poor background. In the old society, I was oppressed and exploited by landlords. I couldn't get enough to eat or wear warm clothes. The landlords didn't care about the lives of the poor at all. We only knew that the landlords were the enemies of the working people. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao led the poor to make revolution and overthrow the three great mountains. After liberation, the Party led the people to carry out land reform and take the road of the people's commune. Only then did the working people completely get rid of the root of exploitation and oppression—the old system—and truly become the masters of the new China. We only know that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are our saviors, and there are no others.

    Just when our country was suffering from three years of natural disasters in a row, right-wing opportunists viciously attacked our beloved Party: first, they cursed our Party for messing things up; second, they cursed our heroic figures for making reckless moves; third, they cursed that the Communist Party wouldn't last long; fourth, they cursed us for not praising "San Zi Yi Bao."

    What was Comrade Wu Han doing at this time? He "burst out" and wrote "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," singing about how good Hai Rui was: first, he sang that Hai Rui was an honest official and a "great savior" of the people, in essence cheering for right-wing opportunists who were opposing the Party and socialism. Second, he sang that Hai Rui "scolded" the emperor, and the more he scolded, the more enjoyable it was, making him a hero, in essence wanting right-wing opportunists to oppose the Party and socialism, unafraid of having their official hats removed. Third, he sang that Hai Rui was not discouraged when he was dismissed from office, in essence encouraging right-wing opportunists not to be discouraged by failure and to make a comeback. Fourth, he sang about Hai Rui's land return campaign, in essence encouraging right-wing opportunists to stir up "San Zi Yi Bao."

    What are we singing about? First, we sing that the people's savior is the Communist Party and Mao Zedong; second, we sing long live the three red flags; third, we sing about our revolutionary history and contemporary heroes—Liu Hulan, Dong Cunrui, Huang Jiguang, Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Mai Xiande, Jiao Yulu—because they lived greatly and died gloriously.

    A comparison of the three thoroughly exposes Comrade Wu Han's crimes of opposing the Party and socialism. We will resolutely defend the Party and defend socialism, and we will not let Wu Han's conspiracy succeed.

    Use Mao Zedong Thought to repel the bourgeoisie's attack
    Liang Yumin

    All true proletarian revolutionaries cannot tolerate Comrade Wu Han's set of bourgeois trash running rampant everywhere. We must resolutely expose, criticize, and struggle against its reactionary essence.

    Culture and literature and art serve politics. The "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" written by Comrade Wu Han are completely in the service of the bourgeoisie. They are big poisonous weeds that are anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist. These two works applaud and cheer for right-wing opportunists who attack the Party. Therefore, the entire script is filled with praise for monsters and demons and insults against the Party.

    I am a soldier. In the hearts of us revolutionary soldiers, the great Party and Chairman Mao are even closer than our own parents. We infinitely love the Party, love Chairman Mao, and love our socialist cause. Therefore, we feel boundless indignation towards Comrade Wu Han's shameful behavior of opposing the Party and socialism.

    Chairman Mao taught us: "In our country, the ideas of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie, anti-Marxist ideas, will exist for a long time. ... We must wage a long-term struggle against the ideas of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie. It is wrong to not understand this situation and abandon ideological struggle." We revolutionary soldiers regard Chairman Mao's books as the supreme instructions for all work and arm our minds with Chairman Mao's thought. We must pick up the guns in our hands to eliminate the enemy's armed attacks, and at the same time, we must pick up the pens to repel the attacks of bourgeois ideology. We must overthrow and discredit all anti-Party, anti-people, anti-socialist monsters and demons, and forever use our guns and pens to defend Marxism-Leninism and the dictatorship of the proletariat, so that the country of the working people is as solid as a rock.

    A sharp challenge
    Gao Changqing

    Wu Han wrote "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor," and said triumphantly that Hai Rui "scolded" the emperor "enjoyably." At that time, right-wing opportunists were scolding the Party Central Committee and socialism. Is this a coincidence? The "hero" fabricated by Wu Han is a "hero" who attacks the Party and attacks socialism. After the right-wing opportunist anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracy was crushed, some people were removed from their posts. Wu Han was not resigned to this and brought out "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," portraying Hai Rui as "pleading for the people," unafraid of losing his post, cheering for the right-wing opportunists, and encouraging them to try again after failure. It can be seen that his reactionary ideology is very clear, and his methods are vicious and sinister. All that Wu Han has done is closely linked to the right-wing opportunists. This is a sharp challenge to the Party.

    We warn Wu Han: We come from the old society. At that time, we were treated as cattle and horses because we did not have the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. With the Party and Chairman Mao, we have today. In our hearts, the Party and Chairman Mao are our red sun. Whoever dares to touch a hair of the Party will be crushed to pieces.

    Our heroes are Jiao Yulu and Lei Feng
    Li Fuchen

    Comrade Wu Han keeps saying that Hai Rui is a hero and wants us to learn from Hai Rui, which makes me very angry.

    What exactly is Comrade Wu Han's political purpose in asking us to learn from Hai Rui? To put it bluntly, it is: to call on us to dare to scold the Communist Party and socialism. I warn Wu Han here: It is absolutely impossible for you to want revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, through learning from Hai Rui, to turn their guns to serve Wu Han in opposing the Party and socialism. Because we deeply understand that the true heroes of our time are Jiao Yulu, Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Mai Xiande. They wholeheartedly serve the Chinese people and the vast majority of the people of the world. They are heroic figures who are not afraid to shed blood and sacrifice themselves for the revolution and are fighting on various fronts of the motherland. We also deeply realize that studying Chairman Mao's works is the fundamental path for the growth of our revolutionary soldiers. No matter how high your "skills" are, no matter how hidden your methods are, Wu Han, we will see through you. Chairman Mao said: "Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary. Whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism is a counter-revolutionary..." If we look at Comrade Wu Han with this teaching of Chairman Mao, isn't he standing opposite us, baring his fangs and claws, opposing our great Party and the socialist revolution? We have the obligation to resolutely wage an irreconcilable struggle against him.

    What is the purpose of shouting about returning land?
    Hui Xianjun

    Wu Han vigorously writes about "returning land." Who should "return land" to? To whom should it be returned? What is the purpose of returning land? Through "Hai Rui's" mouth, he loudly sings: "The south of the Yangtze River is suffering and desolate, and it won't be long before land is returned." "The unjust cases must be redressed," "Only by returning land can the people be at peace." According to Wu Han's logic of "using the past to serve the present," only by dividing the land of our collective economy among individual households, returning it to the landlords and rich peasants, and restoring the old road of capitalism can the people be at peace. This is precisely in line with the tastes of class enemies at home and abroad.

    Isn't this anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds of Wu Han already exposed in broad daylight? Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our country's peasants are taking the road of the people's commune. This road is the road to common prosperity, the road that fundamentally frees the broad masses of peasants from poverty. Those capitalist individual economies of the past have long been pushed into the dustbin of history by the revolutionary people, but Wu Han wants to undermine the foundations of socialism and pave the way for the restoration of capitalism.

    I am a soldier of the People's Liberation Army, holding two guns: one is Mao Zedong Thought, and the other is the weapon in my hand. I will use these two guns to defend our most beloved Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and to defend socialism. No matter if it is Comrade Wu Han, or any anti-Party and anti-socialist elements of any class enemy, if they dare to touch a hair of our Party Central Committee and socialism, I will spare no effort to eliminate them.

    Who is a friend? Who is an enemy?
    Wang Dianyang

    Through the Party's training and education, we understand who our friends are and who our enemies are. We love the people, the Party, socialism, and our great leader Chairman Mao. We hate imperialism, revisionism, reactionaries of all countries, and all other class enemies.

    When introducing his experience in writing "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," Wu Han once said: "Writing about this person, acting this person, is not for the dead, but to serve the living." Then, what kind of living people is Comrade Wu Han serving? It is very obvious that he provided a "timely rain" for the class enemies and offered them advice and strategies. Chairman Mao taught us long ago: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never be reconciled to their defeat. They will still carry out destruction and sabotage in various ways after the country is stabilized. They will try to restore capitalism in China every day and every hour." Then, judging from the theme of the two works written by Wu Han, it also adopted the methods that class enemies have always used: if open struggle doesn't work, use covert struggle; if hard tactics don't work, use soft tactics to attack our Party. He attempted to awaken the social remnants that have long been spurned by the people to restore capitalism and once again ride roughshod over the people.

    Today is the day that countless revolutionary martyrs shed blood, sacrificed themselves, and fought heroically for decades to achieve. If anyone comes to curse our Party and attack our socialist system, whether they are imperialists, revisionists, reactionaries of all countries, or any kind of "Hai Rui," we must resolutely fight them to the end.

### 斗垮吴晗的反动的资产阶级思想

    斗垮吴晗的反动的资产阶级思想
    最近，中国人民解放军某部指战员举行座谈会，对吴晗同志的《海瑞骂皇帝》、《海瑞罢官》进行了严正的批判。下面发表的是部分发言的摘要。
    吴晗同志唱什么？骂什么？
    王成义
    吴晗同志在《海瑞罢官》里，大唱地主阶级的政治代表海瑞是“为民雪恨”的人民“救星”。实质上，他是借海瑞之名，来歌唱大地主、大官僚、右倾机会主义是人民的“救星”。让我们看看历史的真实吧。我是穷人出身的，在旧社会受地主压迫、剥削，吃不饱，穿不暖，地主根本就不管穷人的死活。我们只知道地主是劳动人民的敌人。共产党和毛主席领导穷人闹革命，推翻了三座大山。解放以后，党领导人民搞土改，走人民公社的道路，劳动人民才彻底地摆脱了人剥削人、人压迫人的穷根子——旧制度，真正成了新中国的主人。我们只知道救星是共产党和毛主席，没有别的。
    正当我国连续遭受了三年自然灾害的时候，右倾机会主义分子恶毒地攻击我们敬爱的党：一骂我们的党搞糟了；二骂我们的英雄人物瞎胡闹；三骂共产党长不了；四骂我们不给“三自一包”叫好。
    吴晗同志在这时干了什么呢？他“破门而出”，写了《海瑞骂皇帝》、《海瑞罢官》，歌唱海瑞怎样好：一唱海瑞是清官，是人民的“大救星”，实质上是为右倾机会主义分子反党反社会主义叫好。二唱海瑞“骂”皇帝，越骂越痛快，是英雄好汉，实质上是要右倾机会主义分子反党反社会主义，不怕摘掉乌纱帽丢了官。三唱海瑞被罢了官，不灰心丧气，实质上是鼓动右倾机会主义分子失败了不灰心，卷土重来。四唱海瑞闹退田，实质上是鼓励右倾机会主义闹“三自一包”。
    我们又是唱什么呢？一唱人民救星是共产党、是毛泽东；二唱三面红旗万万岁；三唱我们革命历史和当代的英雄人物——刘胡兰、董存瑞、黄继光、雷锋、王杰、麦贤得、焦裕禄，因为他们活的伟大，死的光荣。
    三者一比较，就彻底暴露了吴晗同志反党反社会主义的罪行。我们坚决保卫党，保卫社会主义，不让吴晗的阴谋得逞。
    用毛泽东思想打退资产阶级的进攻
    梁玉民
    凡是真正的无产阶级革命者，都不能容忍吴晗同志那一套资产阶级货色到处泛滥，必须对它的反动本质进行坚决的揭露、批判和斗争。
    文化和文学艺术是为政治服务的，吴晗同志写的《海瑞骂皇帝》和《海瑞罢官》，是完全为资产阶级服务的，是反党、反人民、反社会主义的大毒草。这两篇作品，替右倾机会主义分子向党进攻拍手叫好，摇旗呐喊。所以，整个剧本都充满着对牛鬼蛇神的歌颂，对党的辱骂。
    我是一个战士。在我们革命战士的心目中，伟大的党和毛主席比我们的亲生爹娘还要亲。我们无限地热爱党，热爱毛主席，热爱我们的社会主义事业。因此，我们对吴晗同志这种反党、反社会主义的可耻行为，感到无比的愤恨。
    毛主席教导我们：“在我国，资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想，反马克思主义的思想，还会长期存在。……我们同资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想还要进行长期的斗争。不了解这种情况，放弃思想斗争，那就是错误的。”我们革命战士把毛主席的书当作各项工作的最高指示，用毛主席的思想武装我们的头脑。我们要拿起手中枪，消灭敌人的武装进攻，同时也要拿起笔杆子，打退资产阶级思潮的进攻。我们一定要把一切反党、反人民、反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神斗垮、斗臭，永远用我们的枪和笔捍卫马克思列宁主义、无产阶级专政，使劳动人民的江山坚如磐石。
    尖锐的挑战
    高长清
    吴晗写了《海瑞骂皇帝》，洋洋得意地说，海瑞“骂”皇帝“骂”得痛快。当时，右倾机会主义者正在大骂党中央、社会主义，难道这是偶合吗？吴晗捏造的什么“英雄”，是攻击党，攻击社会主义的“英雄”。当右倾机会主义反党反社会主义的阴谋被粉碎后，有些人被撤了职。吴晗并不死心，又拿出来《海瑞罢官》，把海瑞说成“为民请命”，不怕丢官，为右倾机会主义分子打气，鼓励他们失败了再干。可见他的反动思想是很明确的，手段是毒辣阴险的。吴晗所作的这一切，完全是和右倾机会主义分子密切结合的，这是他对党的尖锐的挑战。
    我们警告吴晗：我们是从旧社会来的，那时候，我们当牛当马，就是因为没有党和毛主席的领导。有了党和毛主席，我们才有了今天。在我们心中，党和毛主席是我们的红太阳。谁敢动党的一根毫毛，就叫他粉身碎骨。
    我们的英雄是焦裕禄、雷锋
    李福臣
    吴晗同志口口声声说海瑞是英雄，叫我们学习海瑞，使我非常气愤。
    吴晗同志叫我们学习海瑞的政治目的究竟是什么呢？说穿了就是：叫我们敢骂共产党、社会主义。我在这里警告吴晗：你要想叫用毛泽东思想武装起来的拿枪的革命战士，通过学习海瑞，掉转枪口去为吴晗反党反社会主义服务，是绝对办不到的。因为我们深深懂得当代真正的英雄是焦裕禄、雷锋、王杰、麦贤得，他们是全心全意为中国人民和世界绝大多数人服务的，是为革命不怕流血牺牲的战斗在祖国各个岗位上的英雄人物。我们更深深体会到只有学习毛主席著作才是我们革命战士成长的根本道路。吴晗你有多高的“本领”，多么隐蔽的手法，我们也会看穿你的。毛主席说：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派……。”拿毛主席的这一教导去看吴晗同志，他不是正站在我们对面张牙舞爪的反对我们伟大的党和社会主义革命吗？我们有义务坚决和他作不调和的斗争。
    叫嚷退田目的何在？
    惠宪钧
    吴晗大写其“退田”，要谁“退田”？退给谁？退田的目的是什么？他通过“海瑞”的口大唱：“江南困苦凄凉相，不退占田不久长。”“冤狱重重要平反”，“退田才能使民安”。按着吴晗“古为今用”的逻辑，只有把我们集体经济的土地，分给各家各户，退给地主富农，恢复资本主义的老路。这正符合国内外阶级敌人的口味。
    吴晗这种反党、反社会主义言行，不已经暴露在光天化日之下了吗？我国农民在共产党、毛主席的英明领导下，走人民公社的道路，这条道路是共同富裕的道路，是使广大农民从根本上摆脱贫困的道路。过去那些资本主义个体经济，早已被革命的人民推到历史的垃圾堆里去了，吴晗却想挖社会主义的墙脚，为恢复资本主义开辟道路。
    我是一个解放军战士，手持两枝枪，一枝是毛泽东思想，一枝是手中的武器。我就用这两枝枪，保卫着我们心目中最爱戴的党中央和毛主席，保卫社会主义。不管是吴晗同志，不管是任何阶级敌人的反党反社会主义分子，胆敢动我们党中央和社会主义的一根毫毛，我都要不惜一切，将他们消灭掉。
    谁是朋友？谁是敌人？
    王殿阳
    我们经过党的培养教育，懂得了谁是我们的朋友，谁是我们的敌人。我们爱的是人民，是党，是社会主义，是我们伟大的领袖毛主席。我们憎的是帝国主义、修正主义、各国反动派和其他一切阶级敌人。
    吴晗在介绍写《海瑞罢官》的体会时曾经说过：“写这个人，演这个人，不是为了死人，而是为活人服务。”那么吴晗同志是为什么样的活人服务呢？十分明显，他为阶级敌人下了“及时雨”，为他们出了谋，献了策。毛主席很早就教导我们说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。”那么从吴晗所写的两篇作品的主题思想来看，也正是采用了阶级敌人所一贯使用过的手法：明斗不行，用暗斗，硬的不行，用软的方式，向我党进攻。他企图唤起早已被人民所唾弃的社会残渣，来复辟资本主义，重新骑在人民头上作威作福。
    今天，是我们无数革命先烈流血牺牲英勇奋斗几十年换来的今天。如果谁来咒骂我们的党，攻击我们的社会主义制度，不管他们是帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派也好，还是什么样的“海瑞”也好，我们都要坚决和他们斗争到底。
