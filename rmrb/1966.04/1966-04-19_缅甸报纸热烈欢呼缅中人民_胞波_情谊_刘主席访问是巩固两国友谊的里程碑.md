According to Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, April 18th: Several major newspapers here today published editorials warmly welcoming Burmese-Chinese friendship and emphasizing that Chairman Liu Shaoqi's visit will certainly strengthen this friendship.

The *Guardian's* editorial stated: "The most powerful evidence of friendship between the two countries is the amicable demarcation of the 1,250-mile-long border between the two countries—a problem that had been unresolved for centuries." The editorial continued: "The 'Pauk-Phaw' friendship between the peoples of the two countries allowed the problem to be resolved to the satisfaction of both sides, adding new bonds to the sincere friendship between the two countries. The resolution of the border issue irrefutably proves that Burma's great and powerful neighbor has no ambition to covet Burmese territory. To be fair, China has no intention of exerting influence over Burma by any means. Burma's attitude on many international affairs proves this."

The Burmese-language *Working People's Daily* published an editorial today titled "Further Consolidation of Sino-Burmese Friendship," stating: "Chairman Liu Shaoqi's visit will become a milestone in further consolidating the friendship between the two countries." The editorial stated that our two countries strictly abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Under these circumstances, friendly mutual visits between the leaders of the two countries will surely deepen mutual understanding and close friendship between the two countries. The editorial said that only by adhering to the fundamental principles of resolving international issues peacefully, recognizing and respecting each other's sovereignty and independence, not interfering in each other's internal affairs in any way, strictly and correctly adhering to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, equality, and mutual concession can peace be maintained and consolidated.

The editorial said that the People's Republic of China and the Union of Burma abide by these inviolable fundamental principles and strive to safeguard and consolidate world peace. We have always urged and called on countries that do not abide by or do not strive to abide by these principles to abide by them. The relationship between Burma and China has never felt any tension but has developed more and more smoothly.

The English-language *Working People's Daily's* editorial, titled "Consistency in Friendly Policy," said that Chairman Liu Shaoqi's visit cannot but re-emphasize that the policies of friendship, amity, and cooperation between our two countries are consistent.

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, April 18th: Rangoon newspapers prominently published news and pictures on the front page today of Chairman Liu Shaoqi's arrival in Rangoon on the 17th and the warm welcome he received from Chairman Ne Win and the Burmese people.

The English-language *Working People's Daily*'s headline was: "Burma Will Maintain Friendship with China." The Burmese-language *Working People's Daily*'s front-page headline was: "Efforts Will Be Made to Maintain the Traditional Friendly Relations Between the Two Countries." The *Guardian's* headline was: "Chinese Chairman Liu Shaoqi Arrives for a Friendly Visit." The *Mirror's* headline was: "Chinese Chairman Arrives in Rangoon, Welcomed by General Ne Win and the Masses."

All the newspapers prominently published on the front page news and pictures of the state banquet held by Chairman Ne Win for Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his entourage. Almost all the newspapers published the full texts of the speeches by Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Chairman Ne Win at the state banquet. The *Working People's Daily* and the *Guardian* also published editorials welcoming Chairman Liu Shaoqi. (Attached pictures)

    缅甸报纸热烈欢呼缅中人民“胞波”情谊
    刘主席访问是巩固两国友谊的里程碑
    据新华社仰光十八日电　这里的几家主要报纸十八日都发表了社论，热烈欢呼缅中友谊，并且强调指出，刘少奇主席的访问一定会加强这种友谊。
    《卫报》的社论说：“两国友谊的最有力的证据，是友好地标定了两国之间的一千二百五十英里长的边界——这是几世纪遗留下来未解决的问题。”社论接着指出：“两国人民的‘胞波’情谊使问题在双方都感到满意的情况下得到解决，并为两国之间的诚挚友谊增添了新的纽带。边界问题的解决不容置辩地证明，缅甸的伟大强盛的邻邦没有觊觎缅甸领土的野心。说句公道话，中国也没有想用什么办法来对缅甸施加影响。缅甸在许多国际事务上的态度证明了这一点。”
    缅文的《劳动人民日报》今天以《中缅友谊进一步巩固》为题发表社论说：“刘少奇主席这次访问将成为进一步巩固两国友谊的里程碑。”社论说，我们两国严格地遵守和平共处五项原则。在这种情况下，两国领导人的友好互访，一定会加深两国的相互谅解和亲密的友谊。社论说，只有遵守以和平方式解决国际问题的根本原则、承认和尊重彼此的主权和独立、互相不以任何方式干涉内政、严格和正确遵守和平共处五项原则、平等、互让，和平才能得到保持和巩固。
    社论说，中华人民共和国和缅甸联邦遵守了这些不可违反的根本原则，为维护和巩固世界和平而奋斗。我们一向敦促和呼吁不遵守或者不努力遵守这些原则的国家要遵守它们。缅甸和中国的关系从来不曾感到有任何紧张，而是发展得越来越顺利。
    英文的《劳动人民日报》的题目是《友好政策的一贯性》的社论说，刘少奇主席的这次访问不能不再次着重说明我们两国之间的友谊、友好和合作政策是一贯的。
    新华社仰光十八日电　仰光各报十八日在头版最显著地位刊登了刘少奇主席十七日到达仰光和受到奈温主席和缅甸人民热烈欢迎的消息和图片。
    英文版的《劳动人民日报》的标题是：《缅甸将保持同中国的友谊》。缅文版的《劳动人民日报》头版的标题是：《将努力维护两国传统的友好关系。》《卫报》的标题是：《中国刘少奇主席到达进行友好访问。》《镜报》的标题是：《中国主席到达仰光，受到奈温将军和群众的欢迎》。
    所有各报都以头版的显著地位刊载奈温主席为刘少奇主席和他的随行人员举行国宴的新闻和图片。几乎所有各报都全文刊载了刘少奇主席和奈温主席在国宴上的讲话。《劳动人民日报》，《卫报》还分别发表了欢迎刘少奇主席的社论。（附图片）
