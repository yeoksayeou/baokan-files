    For Whom Are They Crying Injustice?
    Shanghai Changning District Public Security Bureau　Xing Yunlong

    In the great debate on the issue of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," Comrade Wu Han made a so-called "self-criticism" about "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," racking his brains to defend himself and launch a counterattack. He repeatedly said, "My political class standpoint is firm," and that he "harbors strong hatred for the past reactionary ruling class and the current five types of elements, and can draw a clear line."

    Has Comrade Wu Han really "drawn a clear line" with class enemies politically? Facts speak louder than words. We judge an author's political stance not by how beautifully he speaks, but mainly by whose interests his actions (works) represent, whom they serve, and whom they benefit. Which class's needs does "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" meet? After this play was performed, it was deeply praised by some four types of elements, which I personally witnessed and heard. At that time, a counter-revolutionary element in our Changning District praised the script of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" with self-satisfaction, saying:

  "What a good article this is!" After watching the play "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," he praised it endlessly, spreading everywhere that "This is such a good historical play, I raise both hands in approval." Another special agent was sent to labor camp for counter-revolutionary crimes. In 1962, his father also brought up Hai Rui to overturn the case for this special agent, openly writing on the "petition" demanding "redress": "Unless Hai Rui is reborn in this world, the injustice can be redressed, otherwise, it will be buried forever." What is this voice? This is the voice of the enemies of the proletariat expressing their utmost gratitude to Comrade Wu Han, this is the voice of the enemies of the proletariat crying injustice and counterattacking us, this is the ghostly voice of the enemies of the proletariat trying to restore the old order. Chairman Mao earnestly taught us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we must support; whatever the enemy supports, we must oppose." And the "innumerable injustices must be redressed" sung by Comrade Wu Han in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" has received such warm support from class enemies. Doesn't this prove that Comrade Wu Han, through the mouth of "Hai Rui," is singing the same tune as the class enemies?

    Let's take Comrade Wu Han's "redressing grievances" in the script as an example! He spent so much ink describing a feudal landlord class bureaucrat as the "savior" of the working people. Is this "drawing a clear line" with "the past reactionary ruling class"? Feudal landlord class bureaucrats are the deadly enemies of the working people. Not only will they not "redress the grievances" of the working people, but on the contrary, they are precisely the creators of the working people's grievances. The reason why Comrade Wu Han fabricated Hai Rui's "redressing grievances" is nothing more than to slander "the present is not as good as the past." We must resolutely expose his conspiracy. Everyone knows that in our proletarian country, under the correct leadership of the Party, there is no "unjust case" at all. Then, are there people in the country who are crying injustice? Yes, they are those stubborn and unrepentant elements who resolutely oppose the Party, oppose the people, and oppose socialism. They fantasize about Hai Rui being reborn to redress their "grievances." Comrade Wu Han is doing his best to promote Hai Rui, and wants us to learn from the feudal bureaucrat Hai Rui. His intention is very malicious. If our public security personnel really learn from Hai Rui and "redress grievances" for the reactionary class, wouldn't that be to abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat and throw the proletarian world into chaos!

    Our broad masses of public security personnel are determined to join the broad masses of the people, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, to拔掉 this anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist poisonous weed.

    替谁喊冤叫屈？	    上海市长宁区公安分局　邢云龙
    在《海瑞罢官》问题的大辩论中，吴晗同志作了关于《海瑞罢官》的所谓“自我批评”，挖空心思地替自己辩护并进行反扑。他口口声声说：“政治上的阶级立场是站稳了的”，“对过去的反动统治阶级和当前的五类分子，怀有强烈的憎恨，能够划清界线”。
    吴晗同志在政治上果真是和阶级敌人“划清界线”了吗？事实胜于雄辩。我们判断一个作者的政治立场，不是看他说得如何漂亮，而主要是看他的行动（作品）代表谁的利益，为谁服务，对谁有利。《海瑞罢官》适应哪个阶级的需要呢？这个剧本在演出后深受一些四类分子的赞扬，这是我所亲见亲闻的。当时我们长宁区有个反革命分子看了《海瑞罢官》的剧本，洋洋自得地称赞说：
  “这是多么好的一篇文章！”他看了《海瑞罢官》的戏以后又赞不绝口，到处宣扬“这是一出多么好的历史戏，我举起双手赞成”。还有一个特务分子因反革命罪行被送去劳动教养，他的父亲在一九六二年也抬出海瑞来为这个特务分子翻案，在要求“平冤狱”的“状纸”上面公然写道：“在现世除非海瑞重生，方能昭雪，否则就此埋送。”这是什么声音？这是无产阶级的敌人对吴晗同志万分感激的声音，这是无产阶级的敌人喊冤叫屈向我们反扑的声音，这是无产阶级的敌人借尸还魂的咒呓声音。毛主席谆谆教导我们说：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”而吴晗同志在《海瑞罢官》里所唱的“冤狱重重要平反”，竟然得到阶级敌人如此热烈的拥护，这岂不是证明吴晗同志通过“海瑞”的嘴，唱着同阶级敌人同一个曲调吗？
    再以吴晗同志在剧本中所讲的“平冤狱”来说吧！他费了那么多的笔墨，把一个封建地主阶级的官僚描写成为劳动人民的“救星”，这难道是“对过去的反动统治阶级”“划清界线”了吗？封建地主阶级的官僚是劳动人民的死对头，他们不但不会替劳动人民“平冤狱”，恰恰相反，他们正是劳动人民冤狱的制造者。吴晗同志所以捏造海瑞“平冤狱”，无非是污蔑“今不如昔”。我们坚决要揭露他的这个阴谋。谁都知道，在我们无产阶级的国家里，在党的正确领导下，根本没有什么“冤狱”。那么国内有没有人喊冤叫屈呢？有，那都是些顽固不化、坚决反党反人民反社会主义的分子。他们幻想海瑞重生，替他们伸“冤”。吴晗同志竭力宣扬海瑞，还要我们向封建官僚海瑞学习，他的用心是非常恶毒的。如果我们公安人员真的向海瑞学习，去为反动阶级“平冤”，那岂不是要取消无产阶级专政，使无产阶级的天下大乱吗！
    我们广大公安人员坚决要同广大人民一起，在毛主席思想的指导下，拔掉这棵反党反人民反社会主义的大毒草。
