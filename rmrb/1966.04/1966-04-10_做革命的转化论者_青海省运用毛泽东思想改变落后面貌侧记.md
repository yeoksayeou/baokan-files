    Becoming Revolutionary Transformationists
    — A Sideline Account of Qinghai Province Using Mao Zedong Thought to Change Its Backward Appearance
    Spring has come to the Qinghai Plateau.
    As the motherland's Third Five-Year Plan begins, Qinghai has also entered a new stage. From the Yellow River Valley to the Qaidam Basin, from the shores of Qinghai Lake to the Tanggula Mountains, people of all ethnic groups, including Han, Tibetan, Hui, Mongolian, Tu, Salar, and Kazakh, under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought and with the promotion of the Socialist Education Movement, are using their laboring hands to paint a new socialist picture on this plateau of more than 700,000 square kilometers.
    Agricultural production throughout the province has steadily increased for several years. In 1965, grain production reached self-sufficiency and surplus, ending the history of relying on state allocation of grain and for the first time contributing grain to national construction. For a high-altitude cold region where pastoral areas account for more than 90 percent and all farmland is 2,000 to 3,000 meters above sea level, this is a remarkable change. Animal husbandry has also developed rapidly. The total value of industrial production in 1965 increased by 28 percent compared to 1964. With economic development, a cultural revolution upsurge has also emerged.
    How did such a favorable situation come about? There are many reasons, but people clearly answer: The most fundamental reason is relying on Mao Zedong Thought, this invincible weapon, mobilizing the wisdom and strength of the broad masses of working people, and continuously promoting the transformation of things. The comrades in Qinghai put it well: "We are doing revolutionary transformation work."

    Using the dialectical materialist viewpoint, correctly understanding Qinghai, and actively transforming Qinghai
    "We are still backward here." Some leading comrades in Qinghai Province, prefectures, and counties often say this. This is not just modesty, but also reflects their confidence in advancing and their determination to continuously make revolution and thoroughly make revolution.
    Things are always divided into two. There are backward elements in the advanced, and advanced elements in the backward.
    The backwardness mentioned here is compared to the prospect of Qinghai developing socialist construction, and to the work that should be done. Regarding agriculture, among the existing eight million mu of cultivated land, only more than two million mu are irrigated. Sixty to seventy percent of the shallow mountain dry land needs to be transformed. Grain production has not yet reached the "Outline" requirements. Regarding animal husbandry, although the grasslands are vast, the utilization rate is not high, and it has not yet completely shaken off the state of relying on nature to raise livestock. Regarding industry, the rich resources above and below ground have not been fully developed and utilized, and a large part of the means of production and daily necessities needed in the province cannot be self-sufficient.
    The backwardness mentioned here is compared to the advanced provinces and regions in the country. Qinghai's work foundation is relatively poor. Some work has not been done thoroughly. The material and cultural living standards of the broad masses of working people are still quite low.
    Backwardness is formed by historical conditions. The exploitation and oppression and the policy of keeping people ignorant by warlords, herd owners, and headmen in the old society made Qinghai's economy and culture many years behind advanced regions. The three consecutive years of natural disasters starting in 1959 and some shortcomings and errors in work also caused some difficulties in the advancement.
    Acknowledging backwardness means finding the gap and finding the starting point for advancement. Acknowledging backwardness is for the purpose of changing backwardness.

    In 1964, while studying Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee put forward the slogan "Correctly understand Qinghai and actively transform Qinghai."
    The plateau climate is dry, which has a disadvantage; but the sunshine duration is long, and there are fewer rain and flood disasters, which has an advantage. The temperature is low, but the temperature difference is large, which is conducive to the growth of crops such as wheat and highland barley.
    The high-altitude cold mountainous areas provide an extremely broad world for the development of animal husbandry production.
    Rich underground treasures are the material foundation for large-scale industrial construction.
    In the past few years, the comrades in Qinghai have used the dialectical materialist viewpoint to specifically analyze the unfavorable and favorable conditions here, and are determined to rely on the more than two million working people of all ethnic groups to create conditions and promote the transformation of contradictions.

    Starting from "one," grasping it to the end, and combining revolutionary courage with a pragmatic spirit
    The emergence of the current favorable situation in Qinghai Province is not an easy task, but the result of a lot of hard and meticulous work.
    The Qinghai Provincial Party Committee often mentions an extremely ordinary but substantial word. This word is: "One."
    "Strive for one fen of land."
    "Protect one sheep."
    "Kill one wolf."
    "Do a good job in one production team."
    "Grasp the mobilization of each household."
    "Take one step at a time and work bit by bit."…
    "Starting from 'one'," putting the ambitious goal of thoroughly changing Qinghai's backward appearance into doing every specific job well; combining revolutionary courage with a pragmatic spirit.

    It is on this word "one" that the people of all ethnic groups on the Qinghai Plateau have done a great "article," broken through the situation, and created countless moving heroic deeds. Madoi County, located at the source of the Yellow River, suffered a severe snowstorm last winter and this spring. Under the guidance of the spirit of "protecting one sheep," the broad masses of working herdsmen fought against the wind and snow to protect livestock over the winter. Many people guarded the herds overnight, sleeping in the snow in their clothes. Some Tibetan commune members used their own roasted noodles, ghee, and white sugar to supplement the lambs. Starting from the active desire to keep more lambs alive and fewer lambs dying, the herdsmen also created and promoted a variety of snow-pushing tools to overcome the wind and snow and win a bumper harvest. Now, this county has an average of 108 sheep per person.
    One sheep is indeed a very small number, but as one responsible comrade pointed out; "Protecting one sheep is easy to do for each flock. If everyone can realistically start from protecting one sheep, the province has tens of thousands of flocks, and it can increase by tens of thousands of sheep."
    In the shallow mountainous areas with severe soil erosion, the broad masses, in the spirit of starting from "one," dug fish-scale pits one shovel and one hoe at a time, built level terraces, planted trees one by one, built terraced fields one mu at a time, and controlled mountains and rivers one gully and one slope at a time. In the past year alone, the treatment area reached more than 430,000 mu. On both sides of the Huangshui River and in the Chuan water area along the Lanqing Railway, we also saw the enthusiastic scenes of the broad masses of commune members, guided by the spirit of grasping "one," wielding hoes and shovels, blocking mud and clearing silt, and trying every means to compete with the river for land. The Laoya City Brigade of the Laoya Commune in Ledu County used the wide and shallow riverbed of the Huangshui River, and through one shovel and one hoe, stabilized the water flow, built stone embankments, and silted out more than 100 mu of fertile land on the opposite river beach. The commune members named it "Hainan Island." This "Hainan Island" gave the commune members saw victory and hope. They said: "Today, seizing land is one hoe and one shovel, tomorrow, autumn grain will have thousands and thousands of dan."
    Here, ideals and reality, long-term plans and current work, strategic goals and tactical steps, are dialectically unified in this word "one."

    Starting from "one," grasping it to the end; basing on the present and facing the future; both daring to do and not doing blindly. This is the specific application of the revolutionary theory of transformation in leadership work. It embodies Comrade Mao Zedong's brilliant thought on the combination of revolutionary courage and a pragmatic spirit.

    Starting from current conditions, giving play to subjective initiative, and continuously creating new conditions
    To promote the transformation of things, it is necessary to grasp the laws of development of things. It is necessary to start from the current objective conditions, and more importantly, to give play to the subjective initiative of people, continuously create conditions, and promote the development of things in the revolutionary direction.
    "It is necessary to adapt to local conditions." This is a phrase often heard in Qinghai. Qinghai has a large area, is inhabited by many ethnic groups, and has complex terrain, climate, and other conditions. Without grasping the laws of development of things, without adapting to existing conditions, without making specific analysis of specific problems, and simply engaging in or demanding uniformity, setbacks will inevitably be encountered. In a county, people pointed to the remains of a canal project for us to see. This "canal" was unsuccessful because it did not adapt to the local terrain, water source, irrigated area, and other objective conditions. Although a lot of earth and stone work was dug and a lot of manpower was spent, it still could not divert water and irrigate the land.
    We also looked at many water conservancy projects built in recent years. These projects all pay attention to starting from reality and emphasizing practical results. They can be summarized as five words: "diversion, pumping, lifting, storage, and dam." They all analyze the relationship between the water source and the irrigated area, starting from the specific conditions such as the amount of water flow from the water source and the height of the water source, and use the methods of digging canals to divert water, pumping water with water turbine pumps, lifting water with pumps, storing water in reservoirs and ponds, and building dams to block water or silting ice to melt water to solve the irrigation problem. These projects that adapt to local conditions can solve the problem of one place by building one place.
    The work of improving sheep breeds is also adapted to local conditions. In the past, some places in pastoral areas experimented with improving sheep breeds. The improved lambs had sparse wool and were afraid of freezing, and the young improved sheep had low feeding ability. Successes were achieved in places with warmer climates or with thermal insulation equipment, and in places with sufficient concentrate supplements. However, it was not successful in some places where natural and artificial conditions were insufficient. Improving livestock breeds is a great thing to improve the quality of livestock, but if it is done indiscriminately without considering the conditions, it will have a destructive effect. In recent years, Qinghai Province has gradually promoted the work of improving sheep breeds in certain areas of Haixi, Hainan, and Haibei prefectures where conditions are available, and has achieved good results, accumulating experience for large-scale livestock improvement work.
    "It is necessary to create conditions." This is another phrase often heard in Qinghai. It shows that it is not enough to just stay at adapting to the current objective conditions. More importantly, it is necessary to mobilize the active factors of people, create conditions, and promote the transformation of things.
    In the case of a relatively rapid increase in the number of livestock, many places once reflected: "The carrying capacity of the grassland has reached saturation, and livestock cannot be developed any further." Qinghai has a vast grassland area, and calculated by the existing number of livestock, there should still be plenty of room for development. Why do some people feel that the carrying capacity of the grassland has reached saturation? There are two reasons: The main reason is that the utilization rate of the grassland is not high, some grassland water sources have not been developed, and some grass production is low. The second is that the distribution of grassland is unbalanced. Faced with reality, should we passively stay at adapting to existing conditions and compress or limit the development of livestock? Or should we actively create conditions and develop more livestock?
    Under the leadership of the Party, the herdsmen of all ethnic groups on the Qinghai grassland resolutely took the road of creating conditions and actively carried out grassland construction work: gradually developing planting, establishing artificial forage grass bases; building grassland water conservancy, so that waterless grassland can be used; diverting water to irrigate grassland, promoting pasture growth; and carrying out large-scale elimination of grassland rodent pests to increase grass production…
    Areas that did not originally have the conditions for improving sheep breeds also actively built warm sheds and sheepfolds, and learned improved techniques, gradually creating conditions for improving livestock quality.
    Nature is bullying the weak and fearing the strong. The braver the person, the more wealth they can extract from nature. The more daring they are to create conditions, the more favorable conditions there will be. Now, more than 100,000 mu of artificial forage grass bases have appeared on the Qinghai grassland, and many communes have established some agriculture that serves animal husbandry, producing grain and feed locally. In the past two years, the area of grassland rodent control has exceeded 40 million mu. Haixi, Hainan, and Haibei, the three autonomous prefectures with relatively scarce water sources, have built a large number of water conservancy projects, which have enabled the original 1.6 million mu of water-scarce grassland to be used, and also irrigate more than 2 million mu of grassland every year. Because the herdsmen of all ethnic groups carried forward the revolutionary spirit and created conditions for improving the utilization rate of grassland, they promoted the further development of animal husbandry production. The number of livestock has increased, and the quality has also improved.

    Going deep into reality, investigating and researching, and going to the front line to obtain the "right to speak"
    To do revolutionary transformation work, leaders must pay attention to the development trend of things in complex contradictions, and take the initiative to master the objective laws with an active offensive spirit.
    How can we obtain this initiative? The key lies in going deep into reality, investigating and researching, taking the path of seeking truth from facts, going to the front line to obtain the "right to speak," and striving for "freedom" of action from practice. The Provincial Party Committee once clearly put forward such a call to cadres at all levels: "Put down the airs and improve production." "Go deep into the production team and take root at the grassroots level." Since 1963, several secretaries of the Provincial Party Committee have run pilot projects in rural and pastoral areas, conducted experiments, and grasped models. They strive to achieve: accurate understanding of the situation, seeing the problems, grasping the direction correctly, and thinking about the methods in detail.

    Here is an example: With the improvement of the situation, the Provincial Party Committee considered further developing the reclamation cause in the Qaidam Basin. After years of development, Qaidam's agricultural production has some "foundation"; but some people believe that Qaidam is short of water and soil, and today's agriculture is "a flower in the basin, which is quite good!"
    Can the reclamation cause in Qaidam be further developed? Is there a future? In order to find the correct answer, a Provincial Party Committee secretary personally led a working group, carrying tents, traveled throughout the southern and northern edges of the Qaidam Basin, surveyed wasteland, traveled 6,000 miles, and went to "explore" some rarely visited wastelands. As a result, a large amount of primary data on hydrology, sunshine, geology, soil, and temperature was obtained, providing a reliable basis for the Provincial Party Committee to make the decision to develop the reclamation cause.
    Rodent pests are a major disaster in Qinghai's pastoral areas. They compete with sheep for grass, destroy grasslands, and seriously affect the development of animal husbandry production. In order to truly understand the rodent pest situation, a leading comrade personally went to Guoluo to conduct an investigation and brought back a clear conclusion: "To greatly develop livestock, we must first carry out large-scale rodent control." Once the key is identified and the decision is made, the entire party in the pastoral area is immediately mobilized to grasp this work firmly and go all out. If there is insufficient medicinal material, immediately start building a zinc phosphide factory; if the bait supply cannot keep up, allocate a large number of oats and poor-quality highland barley to send to the pastoral area; if the transportation cannot keep up, mobilize the automobiles of the provincial transportation departments to transport day and night; for large areas of grassland, dispatch aircraft to spray poisoned bait to kill rodents. In the past winter alone, the province killed rodents on more than 13 million mu.
    There are two valleys in the Mutual Aid Tu Autonomous County, and insufficient water sources affect agricultural development. In the past, the County Party Committee always waited for national investment to build foreign reservoirs, and the result was sighing at the "foreign." Last July, a responsible comrade of the County Party Committee, accompanied by scientific and technical cadres, ran through more than ten mountain ditches in the area, consulted with the masses, surveyed water sources, and finally found a water source and suitable location for building a reservoir, and in October last year, relying on the masses to design and construct, used local methods to build a reservoir. The County Party Committee held a Standing Committee meeting at the site of this reservoir to further study and determine the approach of vigorously building reservoirs to improve irrigation.

    Through practice, understanding the laws, and learning to correctly apply the laws in practice, people can gradually enter the realm of freedom from necessity. Now, many comrades in Qinghai have practiced Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings on seeking truth from facts and the mass line with action, achieving a combination of general appeals and individual guidance; a combination of leaders and the masses; coming from the masses and going to the masses, thereby placing themselves in an active position in the revolutionary transformation process.

    With the development of the situation, frequently conduct "contradiction lineups" and put forward new goals of struggle in a timely manner
    Following Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings, the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee studied and applied the law of the unity of opposites, frequently conducted "contradiction lineups" with the development of the situation, actively captured and analyzed the contradictions in real life, and put forward new goals of struggle in a timely manner to determine the direction of work.
    In 1964, the Provincial Party Committee specially held seven off-the-job study classes, each lasting two weeks, and organized cadres above the department and bureau levels to study "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," analyzing the social contradictions in Qinghai Province and the contradictions in production and construction. At each meeting, the cadres below were also required to present contradictions and find reasons, so that everyone was aware of the contradictions and often had problems in their minds, striving to see the next step when taking a step and continuously making revolution and continuously moving forward.
    For example, in 1963, the situation of agricultural and animal husbandry production in Qinghai improved, and some cadres developed complacency and relaxation. The Provincial Party Committee timely pointed out that the province's total grain output, yield per mu, and livestock development had not yet reached the highest level in history, and the development of work was still unbalanced, which was incompatible with the requirements of the situation of building a new Qinghai on a larger scale, requiring everyone to look at problems from two aspects, "find shortcomings after winning a victory." The comrades in Guide County originally thought that the grain output in 1963 had reached "Ala Ami Mountain (the highest mountain in Guide)," but after this reminder from the Provincial Party Committee, they saw the shortcomings and led the masses to tap potential and continue to advance. In 1964, the county's grain output increased by about 4 percent. They finally admitted convincingly: "After crossing Ala Ami Mountain, there are even higher peaks."

    Since last year, the situation in the province has undergone a greater transformation, and grain and livestock production have exceeded and reached the highest levels in history. Some cadres felt that "there is flour in the cabinet and money in hand," and always wanted to "defend the position," not daring to move forward, fearing that they would smash their own "comfortable home" of having enough to eat and wear. This is essentially the small-scale peasant economic thought of small heavens and small earths and self-sufficiency. At this time, the Provincial Party Committee sharply pointed out: "Small-scale peasant economic thought cannot lead socialist large-scale agriculture (animal husbandry)." It criticized this thought that was unfavorable to the development of production. Some people believe that the leadership can remind the comrades below when they are ignorant, knock them when they are cocky, help them when they are hesitant, and guide them when they face a fork in the road, so that they can always be politically clear. Some people call this practice of reminding, knocking, helping, and guiding "weather forecast," saying that frequently and timely issuing this "weather forecast" can keep the comrades below on the right track in their thinking.
    Change is endless, and the situation of great transformation has caused some comrades' thinking to lag behind for a while, and their understanding lags behind the situation. The process of continuously doing revolutionary transformation work is the process of continuously fighting against various erroneous thoughts. To thoroughly break with all decadent and backward thoughts, viewpoints, traditions, and habits, and to create a newer situation at a faster pace, this is the work that the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee is currently considering and is vigorously carrying out. The large-scale discussion of learning from Jiao Yulu and striving to promote the revolutionization of the thinking and leadership style of leaders at all levels is being widely launched in Qinghai.

    Change is endless, and with the development of production, many new contradictions and new problems have been put on the agenda:
    In order to build pastoral areas for a long time, how can we better achieve fixed and rotational grazing? How to implement the mechanization of animal husbandry production?
    How to reclaim a certain amount of wasteland with conditions and steps on the basis of doing a good job in existing cultivated land?
    How to plant trees and afforest, improve soil, and control ditches in shallow mountainous areas to ensure stable and high yields of grain on a larger area?
    How to use the rivers in the territory more and better for irrigation and power generation?…

    The comrades in Qinghai Province are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with the viewpoint of "basing on the present and facing the future," with a humble and cautious attitude, taking the advanced brotherly provinces and regions as examples, finding gaps, grasping contradictions, thinking about these problems, and actively starting to solve these problems, and continuously promoting the transformation of various tasks in the revolutionary direction.

    做革命的转化论者
    ——青海省运用毛泽东思想改变落后面貌侧记
    春天来到了青海高原。
    在祖国第三个五年建设计划开始的时候，青海也步入了一个新的阶段。从黄河河谷到柴达木盆地，从青海湖畔到唐古拉山，汉、藏、回、蒙古、土、撒拉、哈萨克等各族人民，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在社会主义教育运动的促进下，用劳动的双手，在这一片七十多万平方公里的高原上，描绘着社会主义的新图。
    全省农业生产连续几年稳定上升，一九六五年，粮食达到自给有余，从此结束了依赖国家调拨粮食的历史，并第一次拿出粮食支援国家建设。对一个牧区面积占百分之九十以上、全部农田在拔海二千米至三千多米的高寒地区来说，这是一个了不起的变化。牧业发展也很快。工业生产总值，一九六五年比一九六四年增加了百分之二十八。随着经济的发展，一个文化革命高潮也已出现。
    大好形势是怎么来的？原因很多，人们明确地回答：最根本的原因是依靠毛泽东思想这个战无不胜的武器，调动了广大劳动人民的智慧和力量，不断促进事物的转化。青海的同志们说得好：“我们就是做革命的转化工作的。”
    用辩证唯物主义观点，正确认识青海，积极改造青海
    “我们这里还落后。”青海省、州、县一些领导同志常常这样说。这不单是谦虚，而且反映了他们前进的信心和不断革命、彻底革命的决心。
    事物总是一分为二的。先进之中有落后的因素，落后之中有先进的因素。
    这里所说的落后，是拿现状同青海发展社会主义建设事业的远景对比，是同应做的工作对比。论农业，在现有的八百万亩耕地中，水浇地只有二百多万亩。有百分之六七十的浅山旱地需要改造。粮食产量尚未达到“纲要”的要求。论牧业，草原虽然辽阔，但利用率不高，仍未完全摆脱靠天养畜的状况。论工业，地上地下丰富的资源还没有充分地开发利用，省内所需要的生产资料和生活用品，还有很大一部分不能自给。
    这里所说的落后，是同全国先进的省、区比。青海的工作基础比较差。有些工作还没有做到家。广大劳动人民的物质生活和文化生活的水平还相当低。
    落后，是历史条件形成的。旧社会的军阀、牧主、头人的剥削压迫和愚民政策，使青海的经济文化比起先进地区落后了好多年。从一九五九年开始的连续三年自然灾害和某些工作上的缺点和错误，也造成了前进中的一些困难。
    承认落后就找到了差距，就找到了前进的出发点。承认落后，目的在于改变落后。
    一九六四年，在学习毛泽东同志的《实践论》、《矛盾论》中间，青海省委提出了“正确认识青海，积极改造青海”的口号。
    高原气候干旱，有不利的一面；但日照时间长，雨涝灾害少，又有有利的一面。气温较低，温差却较大，有利于小麦、青稞等作物的生长。
    高寒山区，为畜牧业生产的发展，提供了极为广阔的天地。
    丰富的地下宝藏，是大规模进行工业建设的物质基础。
    青海的同志们几年来用辩证唯物主义观点，具体地分析了这里的不利条件和有利条件，决心依靠二百多万各族劳动人民，创造条件，促进矛盾的转化。
    从“一”抓起，一抓到底，把革命胆略和求实精神结合起来
    青海省当前大好形势的出现，并不是一件容易的事情，是进行了大量艰苦、细致的工作的结果。
    青海省委常常提到一个极其普通但却有充实内容的字眼。这个字眼就是：“一”。
    “争一分地。”
    “保一只羊。” 
    “打一只狼。”
    “搞好一个生产队。”
    “抓一家一户的发动。”
    “一步一个脚印，一点一滴地工作。”……
    “从‘一’抓起”，把彻底改变青海落后面貌的这个雄心壮志，落实到做好每一件具体工作上面；把革命胆略和求实精神结合了起来。
    就是在这个“一”字上，青海高原的各族人民大做了“文章”，闯开了局面，创造了无数动人的英雄事迹。位于黄河源头的玛多县，去冬今春遭到了一次特大风雪灾害，广大劳动牧民在“保一只羊”精神的指导下，奋战风雪，护畜越冬。很多人跟群守夜，在雪地中和衣而眠。有的藏族社员用自己食用的炒面、酥油和白糖补饲羊羔。从力争羊羔多活少死的积极愿望出发，牧民群众还创制推广了多种推雪工具，战胜了风雪，夺得了丰收。现在，这个县按人口平均计算，每人拥有一百零八只羊。
    一只羊，这的确是一个很小的数字，但是，正如一位负责同志所指出的；“保一只羊，这个要求对于每个畜群来说，是容易做到的，如果大家都能实实在在地从保一只羊做起，全省有几万个畜群，就能多增几万只羊。”
    在水土流失严重的浅山地区，广大群众本着从“一”抓起的精神，一锹一镐地挖鱼鳞坑，修水平阶，一株一株地植树造林，一亩一亩地修梯田，一沟一坡地治山治水，只去年一年，治理面积就达到四十三万多亩。在湟水两岸，在兰青铁路沿线的川水地区，我们也看到了广大社员以抓“一”的精神为指导，挥镐舞锹，拦泥清淤，千方百计与河争地的热烈场景。乐都县老鸦公社老鸦城大队利用湟水宽浅河床，通过一锹一镐，稳定水流，砌石培埂，在对岸河滩淤出了一百多亩肥沃土地。社员们名之为“海南岛”。这个“海南岛”，使社员们看到了胜利和希望。他们说：“今天夺地是一镐一锹，明天秋粮有千担万担。”
    在这里，理想和现实，长远设想和眼前工作，战略目标和战术步骤，辩证地统一在这个“一”字上。
    从“一”抓起，一抓到底；立足当前，面向未来；既要敢干，又不蛮干。这是革命的转化论在领导工作中的具体运用。它体现了毛泽东同志关于革命胆略和求实精神相结合的光辉思想。
    从当前的条件出发，发挥主观能动作用，不断创造新的条件
    要促进事物转化，必须掌握事物发展规律。既要从当前的客观条件着手，更要发挥人的主观能动精神，不断创造条件，促进事物向革命的方向发展。
    “要因地制宜。”这是在青海经常听到的一句话。青海面积很大，多民族聚居，地形气候等条件很复杂。不掌握事物发展规律，不适应现有条件，不对具体问题作具体分析，简单从事或者强求一律，一定会碰到挫折。在一个县，人们指着一条渠道工程的遗迹给我们看。这条“渠道”就因为没有适应当地的地形、水源、灌区等客观条件，虽然挖了不少土方石方，费了许多人力，还是引不出水，浇不成地。
    我们又看了许多近几年兴修的水利。这些工程都注意从实际出发，讲求实效。它们可以归纳为“引、泵、提、蓄、坝”五个字，都是分析了水源与灌区的关系，从水源流量的多少，水源位置的高低等具体条件出发，分别采用修渠引水、水轮泵打水、抽水机提水、水库涝池蓄水、筑坝拦水或淤冰化水来解决灌溉问题。这些因地制宜的工程，修一处就能解决一处的问题。
    改良绵羊的工作也是因地制宜的。以前，牧区一些地方试验改良绵羊。改良羊羔毛稀怕冻，幼龄改良羊采食能力低。在气候较暖或有保暖设备的地方，在有足够精料补饲的地方，都获得成功。而在一些自然条件和人工条件不够的地方就没有成功。改良畜种是提高牲畜质量的大好事，但是如果不看条件乱办，反而会起破坏作用。这几年，青海省在条件具备的海西、海南、海北三州某些地区逐步推行改良绵羊工作，都获得了很好的成绩，为大规模开展牲畜改良工作积累了经验。
    “要创造条件。”这是在青海经常听到的又一句话。它说明，不能仅仅停留于适应当前客观条件，更重要的，是要调动人的积极因素，创造条件，促进事物转化。
    在牲畜数量增长较快的情况下，不少地方曾经反映：“草原载畜量达到饱和点了，牲畜再要发展不行了。”青海草原面积辽阔，按已有牲畜头数计算，应该还大有发展的余地，为什么有些人觉得草原载畜量达到饱和点了呢？原因有两个：主要是草原利用率不高，有的草原的水源没有被开发，有的产草量低。其次是草原分布不平衡。面对现实，是消极地停留于适应现有条件，压缩或者限制牲畜的发展呢？还是积极地创造条件，更多地发展牲畜呢？
    青海草原上的各族牧民，在党的领导下坚决走创造条件的路，积极进行草原建设工作：逐步发展种植业，建立人工饲草基地；兴修草原水利，使无水草原得到利用；引水灌溉草原，促进牧草生长；大规模消灭草原鼠害，增加产草量……
    原来不具备改良绵羊条件的地区，也积极建设暖棚羊舍，学习改良技术，为提高牲畜质量逐渐创造条件。
    大自然是欺软怕硬的。越是勇敢的人，越能向自然索取到更多的财富。越敢于创造条件，有利条件也就越来越多。现在，青海草原上已经出现了十万多亩人工饲草基地，有不少公社办起了一些为牧业服务的农业，就地生产粮食和饲料。最近两年中，草原灭鼠面积已经超过四千万亩。海西、海南、海北三个水源较缺的自治州，兴修起大量水利工程，已使原来缺水的一百六十万亩草原得到利用，每年还灌溉草原两百多万亩。由于各族牧民发扬革命精神，为提高草原利用率创造了条件，促进了牧业生产进一步发展，牲畜数量更多了，质量也有所提高。
    深入实际，调查研究，到第一线去取得“发言权”
    做革命的转化工作，领导人员就必须在复杂的矛盾中，时时注意事物发展的动向，以积极进攻的精神，去取得驾驭客观规律的主动权。
    怎样才能取得这种主动权呢？关键在于深入实际，调查研究，走实事求是之路，到第一线去取得“发言权”，从实践中去争得行动的“自由”。省委曾经向各级干部明确提出这样的号召：“把架子放下来，把生产搞上去。”“深入生产队，扎根在基层。”从一九六三年以来，省委的几位书记都在农村、牧区办过点，搞过试验，抓过样板。他们力争做到：情况摸得准，问题看得见，方向抓得对，办法想得细。
    有这样一个例子：随着局面的好转，省委考虑在柴达木盆地进一步发展农垦事业。柴达木经过多年开发，农业生产有了一些“底子”；但是有人认为：柴达木缺水、少土，有了今天这点农业，就是“盆中一枝花，满不错了！”
    柴达木的农垦事业能不能进一步发展？有没有前途呢？为了寻求正确的答案，一位省委书记曾经亲自率领工作组，带着帐房，走遍了柴达木盆地的南缘和北缘，踏勘荒地，行程六千里，一些人迹罕到的荒草滩，也要去“探一探险”。结果，取得了大量的水文、日照、地质、土壤和气温等方面的第一性资料，为省委定下发展农垦事业的决心，提供了可靠根据。
    鼠害是青海牧区一大灾害，它与羊争草，破坏草原，严重影响了牧业生产的发展。为了确实弄清鼠害状况，一位领导同志亲自到果洛作了调查，带回来一个明确的结论：“牲畜要大发展，必先大规模地灭鼠。”关键一经看准，决心既已下定，就立即动员牧区全党狠抓这项工作，全力以赴。药料不足，马上动手兴建磷化锌厂；饵料接济不上，就拨出大批燕麦和秕青稞送往牧区；运输赶不上，就动员省属交通部门的汽车，日夜兼程赶运；大面积的草原，就出动飞机喷撒毒饵灭鼠。只去年一冬，全省就灭鼠一千三百多万亩。
    互助土族自治县内有两条谷地，水源不足，影响农业发展。过去县委总是等着要国家投资，搞洋水库，结果是望“洋”兴叹。去年七月，县委一位负责同志偕同科学技术干部，跑遍了当地十多条山沟，向群众请教，勘探水源，终于找到了修建水库的水源和适宜位置，并在去年十月，依靠群众设计、施工，用土办法修成了一个水库。县委在这个水库现场召开了常委会，进一步研究确定了大办水库，改善灌溉的做法。
    通过实践，认识规律，并在实践中学会正确地运用规律，人们就能从必然逐步进入到自由的境界。现在，青海已有不少同志用行动实践了毛泽东同志关于实事求是和群众路线的教导，做到了一般号召和个别指导相结合；领导和群众相结合；从群众中来，到群众中去，从而在革命的转化过程中，使自己处于主动地位。
    随着形势的发展，经常进行“矛盾排队”，及时提出新的奋斗目标
    青海省委遵循毛泽东同志的教导，学习和运用对立统一的规律，经常随着形势的发展搞一搞“矛盾排队”，积极捕捉和分析现实生活中的矛盾，及时提出新的奋斗目标，确定工作方向。
    一九六四年，省委曾经专门举行过七次、每次两个星期的离职学习班，组织部、厅级以上干部学习《实践论》和《矛盾论》，分析青海省的社会矛盾和生产建设中的矛盾。每次开会，也要求下面的干部摆矛盾，找原因，使大家对矛盾心中有数，脑子里经常装着问题，努力做到走上步看下步，不断革命，不断前进。
    譬如，一九六三年青海农牧业生产情况有了好转，一部分干部产生了自满松劲情绪。省委就及时指出，全省粮食总产、单产和牲畜发展，都还没有达到历史上最高水平，工作发展还不平衡，它和更大规模地建设新青海这个形势要求不相适应，要求大家一分为二看问题，“打了胜仗找缺点”。贵德县的同志原来认为一九六三年的粮食产量已经到了“阿拉阿米山了（贵德境内最高的山）”，经过省委这一提醒，他们看到了不足之处，领导群众挖潜力，继续前进。一九六四年，这个县的粮食产量又增长了百分之四左右。他们终于心服口服地承认：“跃过阿拉阿米山，还有更高峰。”
    去年以来，全省局面有了更大转变，粮畜生产都超过和达到了历史上的最高水平。有的干部就觉得“柜里有面，手里有钱”，老想“保阵地”，不敢向前闯，生怕砸碎了自己温饱的“小康之家”。这实质上是小天小地、自给自足的小农经济思想。这时省委又尖锐地提出：“用小农经济思想是不能领导社会主义大农（牧）业的。”批判了这种不利生产发展的思想。有人认为，领导上在下面同志懵懂的时候点一点，翘尾巴的时候敲一敲，犹豫不决的时候帮一帮，面临歧路的时候引一引，就可以使自己在政治上永远清醒。有人把这种点、敲、帮、引的做法，叫做“天气预报”，说经常及时地发这种“天气预报”，就能使下面的同志在思想上不离正道。
    变无止境，大转变的局面，使有些同志的思想一时还跟不上来，认识落后于形势。不断地做革命的转化工作的过程，就是不断地与各式各样错误思想作斗争的过程。彻底地与一切陈腐、落后的思想、观点、传统和习惯决裂，以更快的步伐，闯出一个更新的局面来，这是青海省委当前正在考虑，并已在大力进行的工作。学习焦裕禄，努力促进各级领导思想、领导作风革命化的大讨论，正在青海普遍展开。
    变无止境，伴随着生产的发展，许多新矛盾和新问题被提到议事日程上来了：
    为了长期建设牧区，怎样更好地实现定居轮牧？怎样实行牧业生产机械化？
    怎样在搞好现有耕地的基础上，有条件有步骤地开垦一定数量的荒地？
    怎样在浅山地区植树造林、改土治沟，以保证在更大面积上取得粮食的稳产高产？
    怎样更多更好地利用境内河流来灌溉、发电？……
    青海省的同志们正高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，以“立足当前，面向将来”的观点，以谦虚谨慎的态度，以先进兄弟省、区为榜样，找差距，抓矛盾，思考着这些问题，积极地着手解决这些问题，不断促进各项工作向革命的方向转化。
