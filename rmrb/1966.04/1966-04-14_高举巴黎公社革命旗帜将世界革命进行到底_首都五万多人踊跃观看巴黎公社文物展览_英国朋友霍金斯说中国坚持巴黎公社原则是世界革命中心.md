    According to Xinhua News Agency, April 13th: Over 50,000 people in the capital have viewed the "Exhibition of Cultural Relics and Materials of the Paris Commune." This exhibition has aroused strong reactions among the audience, who expressed in their messages that they want to "hold higher the revolutionary banner of the Paris Commune and carry the world proletarian revolution through to the end."
    Just as Marx once said: "The Paris of the workers and its Commune will forever be celebrated as the glorious harbinger of a new society." The exhibition opened on March 30th, and the audience was very enthusiastic. The visitors included workers, commune members from suburban communes, cadres from government offices, students, commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, and ordinary citizens. Some foreign friends in Beijing also visited the exhibition. Many people took notes while viewing the exhibits. The number of visitors increased so much that the exhibition organizers had to extend the exhibition period by a week at the request of the audience. Today, the exhibition has closed.
    During the two-week exhibition, the audience saw exhibits of the Paris Commune's life-and-death struggle against the counter-revolution. They revisited the experience and lessons of the first proletarian regime in human history ninety-five years ago, which further inspired revolutionary enthusiasm. A visitor surnamed Mo wrote in the guestbook: "The wheels of history are irresistible, and revolution will surely triumph; we will always remember your name—'Paris Commune'." A young student visited the exhibition on April 3rd, the day he cast his first vote to elect delegates to the Sixth People's Congress of the District of Beijing. He wrote in the guestbook: "Today is the first day I participated in the election, and now I realize how hard-won my vote is. Countless revolutionary martyrs shed their blood and sacrificed themselves to exchange for today's state of proletarian dictatorship. I must cherish the fruits of revolutionary victory, intensify my training, cultivate myself into a strong and reliable successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause, and contribute my whole life to the cause of human liberation." Another young student wrote: "Under the huge photograph of the 'Wall of Communards,' I deeply realize how heavy the burden on the shoulders of a new Chinese youth is. We must sing the Internationale loudly and forever point the banner of Marxism-Leninism towards communism."
    The audience felt particularly close to the exhibits that praised the Paris Commune fighters for taking up their guns, using revolutionary violence to smash the bourgeois state apparatus, and carrying out a heroic struggle to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat. A woodcarving worker wrote in a message: "This exhibition has left a very deep impression on me, especially the truth that the proletariat must use violence to seize power, which is even more deeply engraved in my mind." Another visitor wrote: "Through the Paris Commune photo exhibition, I have a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's truth that the whole world must be transformed by the barrel of a gun."
    The audience also expressed their heartfelt thanks to the British friends, Mr. and Mrs. Hawkins, who collected and provided nearly four hundred cultural relics and materials of the Paris Commune. Sixty-year-old Hawkins was so moved by the enthusiasm and eagerness of the audience that he repeatedly shed tears. He excitedly said to his Chinese friends: "China adheres to the principles of the Paris Commune, and China is the center of world revolution!" During their visits to various parts of China, Mr. and Mrs. Hawkins collected portraits of Chairman Mao and the five-star red flag, and collected the "Red Flag" magazine containing the article "The Great Enlightenment of the Paris Commune" as a souvenir. He said that everything he saw in China was beyond his expectations. He said that after returning to his country, he must report his experiences and feelings in China to his British friends.

    高举巴黎公社革命旗帜将世界革命进行到底
    首都五万多人踊跃观看巴黎公社文物展览
    英国朋友霍金斯说中国坚持巴黎公社原则是世界革命中心
    据新华社十三日讯　首都五万多人观看了“巴黎公社文物资料展览”。这个展览在观众中引起强烈反响，人们在留言中表示要“更高地举起巴黎公社的革命旗帜，将世界无产阶级革命进行到底”。
    正象马克思曾经说过的那样：“工人的巴黎及其公社将永远作为新社会的光辉的先驱受人敬仰。”这个展览在三月三十日开幕后，观众十分踊跃。参观的有工人、郊区公社社员、机关干部、学生、解放军指战员和市民。在北京的一些外国朋友也看了展出。不少人一边看，一边作了笔记。参观的人越来越多，以至于展出主办单位只好根据观众的要求，把展出期限延长一周。今天，这个展览已经闭幕。
    在两周展出中，观众看到巴黎公社与反革命进行生死搏斗的展品。重温了九十五年前人类历史上第一个无产阶级政权的经验和教训，更加激发了革命的豪情。一位姓墨的参观者在留言簿上写道：“历史的车轮是不可阻挡的，革命一定能胜利；我们永远记住您的名字——‘巴黎公社’”。有一位青年学生在四月三日参观了展览，这一天正是他第一次投票选举北京市第六届区人民代表大会代表的日子。他在留言簿上写道：“今天是我第一次参加选举的日子，现在我更认识到自己那一张选票来得多么不容易。无数革命先烈流血牺牲才换来今天的无产阶级专政的国家，我一定珍惜革命胜利果实，加紧锻炼，把自己培养成无产阶级革命事业坚强可靠的接班人，为人类的解放事业贡献出自己的一生。”另一个青年学生写道：“在‘公社社员墙’的巨幅照片下，我深深地体会到，一个新中国青年身上的担子是多重。我们一定高唱国际歌，把马列主义的旗帜永远指向共产主义。”
    观众们对展品中歌颂巴黎公社战士拿起枪杆子，用革命暴力粉碎资产阶级的国家机器，为建立无产阶级专政而进行的英勇斗争，感到特别亲切。一位木刻工人留言说：“这次展览给我留下很深刻的印象，尤其关于无产阶级必须以暴力来夺取政权的道理，更加铭刻在我的脑海中。”另一位参观者写道：“通过巴黎公社图片展览，使我对毛主席关于整个世界必须用枪杆子来改造这个真理，体会得更深刻了。”
    观众们还对收藏和提供近四百件巴黎公社文物资料的英国朋友霍金斯夫妇，表示衷心感谢。六十岁的霍金斯看到观众这样热情，这样踊跃，感动得一再流下眼泪。他激动地向中国朋友说：“中国坚持巴黎公社的原则，中国是世界革命的中心！”霍金斯夫妇在中国各地参观中，收存起毛主席象和五星国旗，收集了登载着《巴黎公社的伟大启示》一文的《红旗》杂志作为纪念。他说，他在中国看到的一切，出乎他的意料。他表示回国以后，一定要把在中国的见闻和感受，报告给英国朋友。（附图片）
