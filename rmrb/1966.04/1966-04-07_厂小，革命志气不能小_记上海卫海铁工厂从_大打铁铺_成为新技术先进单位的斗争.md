    The Factory Is Small, But Revolutionary Ambition Must Not Be Small
    -- Recording the Struggle of Shanghai Weihai Iron Factory from a "Large Blacksmith Shop" to an Advanced Unit of New Technology
    Shanghai has a small factory, located under a reed mat shed, with only about two hundred people. Over the past nine years, they have held high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, constantly innovating production technology, and the quality of the steel plate springs they produce has caught up with the quality of the same products from the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. This small factory is called Weihai Iron Factory.
    Grasp Class Struggle to Promote Production Struggle
    In 1958, the workers of Weihai Iron Factory were still dealing with iron hammers and bellows all day long, using backward production methods. They were eager to free themselves from heavy manual labor and quickly change the backward state of production. Although these employees from small blacksmith shops had a strong sense of turning over, due to the fact that the public-private partnership was only recently established, they had not undergone systematic socialist education. Some people had relatively strong habits of freedom and laxity, and labor discipline was lax, and they were not united with each other. Some people did not fully understand the significance of their work and were not enthusiastic about production. A conscious working class team had not yet formed. Individual anti-Party and bad elements hiding in the working class team stirred up trouble, openly provoking the relationship between workers and the Party, encouraging workers to make trouble over welfare and bonuses, and spreading rumors such as "Blacksmiths making machines is like a toad wanting to eat swan meat," shaking employees' confidence in changing the face of production.
    At this time, the factory Party branch was established, and the blacksmith team had a leading core. From the beginning, this young Party branch had to answer a question: Should they immediately mobilize the masses to engage in technological revolution, or should they first organize the class ranks and start by raising the consciousness of the employees?
    Under the leadership of the higher-level Party organization, they saw that the struggle for production was closely intertwined with the class struggle, and it was impossible to simply grasp production well. Therefore, they decided to firmly grasp the class struggle, selecting more than twenty workers who had deep-seated bitterness and hatred in the old society and had a firm stand, as the backbone of the class struggle, focusing on cultivation. At the same time, they boldly mobilized the masses, vigorously exposing and criticizing individual anti-Party and bad elements. The employees improved their consciousness in this struggle, distinguished between the enemy and ourselves, and strengthened unity. They realized that those who were flaunting the banner of "fighting for welfare for the workers" were actually attempting to drag the workers back to the old road of being exploited and oppressed. In this way, the Party and League organizations were strengthened, and a backbone team began to be cultivated, and the class ranks were initially purified. The branch then conducted in-depth and meticulous ideological education for the workers, speaking extensively about socialism and the tasks of the working class, and speaking extensively about the importance of organization and discipline.
    The consciousness of all employees in the factory was generally improved, and the desire to change the backward mode of production was even stronger. However, could blacksmiths make machines? Some people said with self-deprecation: "With only two baskets of characters known, can blacksmiths make machines?" Some people said with confidence: "I think we can!" The first to speak out was Jiang Miaotao. This top expert at wielding the sledgehammer, no more than thirty years old, had been forging iron for more than ten years. He said: "Blacksmiths must make machines, we cannot build socialism empty-handed." "We must eat swan meat, we must fight for glory for the proletariat!"
    The Party branch supported this advanced seed, and organized Gu Yaozu and several other blacksmiths to work with him to ensure that this battle was won. Several pairs of forging hands picked up chalk and surrounded the ground to draw sketches and make models. After more than half a year of exploration, they finally made a coil winding machine. The first machine made by the blacksmiths was crude, but it dispelled superstition and boosted everyone's courage. The Party branch seized on this event, and carried out extensive propaganda in the factory, greatly enhancing the ambition of the proletariat. A wave of technological revolution appeared throughout the factory, and one after another special equipment was manufactured.
    True Gold Stands the Test of Fire
    In the years when the country suffered from continuous three-year severe natural disasters, Weihai Iron Factory faced difficulties such as insufficient raw materials, insufficient fuel, and insufficient production tasks. At that time, two-thirds of the products were substandard, and one-third were second-class. Some workers went to support other places and the countryside, and workers transferred from some other factories disliked the poor production conditions here and were not at ease in their work. This was a severe test. Should they adopt a positive attitude, move forward despite difficulties, or be pessimistic and retreat from difficulties? True gold stands the test of fire. The employees of Weihai Iron Factory held high the red banner of the General Line, everyone recalled the past and compared it with the present, remembered bitterness and thought about sweetness, spoke extensively about Mao Zedong Thought, and stimulated revolutionary enthusiasm.
    At the factory-wide employee meeting, Party branch secretary Li Yulin talked about his tragic experience of working as a farmhand for a landlord since he was a child. As soon as he finished speaking, the workers stood up one by one to pour out their grievances. These people, who were called "stinky blacksmiths" in the old society, all had a bellyful of grievances. Worker Feng Guitang opened his clothes, pointed to the scars on his stomach, and denounced the crimes of the old society. Before liberation, a splashed red iron nail was embedded in his stomach, the boss did not give him treatment, he could only use newspaper to stick to the festering wound, and finally he was kicked away and wandered to the countryside to beg for food.
    The more they recalled the old society, the more bitter it became; the more they compared it with the new society, the sweeter it became. Everyone discussed a spirit of resolutely overcoming difficulties. Cadres and workers, two bitter gourds on one vine, were intimate and fearless in the face of difficulties. When there were not enough steel plate spring tasks, they took the initiative to undertake the processing tasks of other large equipment.
    They also worked hard to improve the quality of steel plate springs. Cadres and workers together, spoke extensively about the significance of improving quality. Mass scientific experiments to explore the production laws of steel plate springs were launched throughout the factory.
    Most of the workers in Weihai Iron Factory were deprived of the right to study culture in the old society, and they relied mostly on their own experience in their work, so the operations were very inconsistent. Deputy factory director Wu Miaoxiang, who was born a worker, had only studied for five years since he was a child, and he also did not understand many of the principles of manufacturing steel plate springs. He took several people to observe the operation of each master in the heat treatment workshop, and truthfully described and recorded the operations of the three best technicians, and then organized the masses to repeatedly summarize and discuss, and finally formulated forty-one heat treatment processes. In this way, the forty-odd processes of manufacturing steel plate springs all had new process operating procedures. A set of strict inspection system was also established; a set of scientific testing equipment was also manufactured by relying on their own efforts.
    The quality of Weihai Iron Factory's products has since improved rapidly. The life of a single-piece steel plate spring increased from 70,000 to 80,000 times to 250,000 times. In the 1963 national steel plate spring quality evaluation (Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant did not participate in the evaluation), the quality of Weihai Iron Factory's products was rated as advanced.
    The technical revolution continued unabated. By 1963, the number of self-made equipment had increased to more than fifty units, and 85 percent of the factory's operations had been mechanized and semi-automated.
    "Three Olds" Catch Up with "Three News"
    The quality of the steel plate springs was rated as advanced, and more and more people came to visit and learn from them. As praises grew, a sense of complacency secretly grew among some employees. Some people said: "Now you can say that we are the steel plate king."
    We cannot stop moving forward! The Party branch organized all employees in the factory to study Chairman Mao's teaching that "modesty makes one progress, and arrogance makes one fall behind." The employees compared the quality of their steel plate springs with that of the most advanced Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant in China, and found six gaps; compared with the world's advanced level, the gap was even greater. After mass deliberation and discussion, the factory leaders timely proposed: First, catch up with Changchun in 1964!
    The equipment of Weihai Iron Factory is very different from when it was founded; but compared with Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, it is still far behind. Some people said that Changchun is "Three News" – modern factory buildings, modern equipment, and a first-class technical team. We are "Three Olds" – the factory buildings are "old", two-thirds of them are reed mat sheds; the equipment is "old", most of it is local equipment; the people are also "old", with low cultural level. How can "Three Olds" catch up with "Three News"?
    Can a small factory catch up with and surpass a large factory? The employees of Weihai Iron Factory saw this possibility in the process of studying the revolutionary spirit of Daqing and the People's Liberation Army. The employees said: "The people of Daqing, with the blue sky above their heads and the prairie under their feet, relied on a revolutionary ambition to catch up with the world's advanced level and built a first-class oil field. We still have reed mat sheds above our heads and cinder on the ground, and our conditions are better than Daqing's, so why can't we catch up with Changchun?" Everyone analyzed: "Three Olds" are unfavorable conditions for catching up with Changchun, but there are also favorable aspects: the equipment is self-made local equipment, highly specialized, and workers are familiar with its use; the factory buildings are dilapidated, which can inspire the spirit of self-reliance; the old workers suffered deeply in the old society and have a high degree of class consciousness. Therefore, the employees of Weihai proposed: "With reed mat sheds above our heads and cinder under our feet, establish the ambition of the Foolish Old Man, and 'Three Olds' catch up with 'Three News'."
    To eliminate the six quality gaps with Changchun, the key is to manufacture "Three Machines": make a shot peening machine; make a higher-level coil winding machine; and make a batch of new quenching machines. Shot peening is a new surface strengthening process, which uses a large number of steel balls the size of rapeseed to strike the surface of the steel plate spring at a very high speed. At that time, Weihai Iron Factory did not have a shot peening machine, and the single-piece steel plate spring produced would break after being continuously bent 250,000 times on a fatigue testing machine. If you make a general shot peening machine, it can be extended to more than 600,000 times. If you make a more advanced stress shot peening machine, which has only recently appeared in the world, it can be extended to more than one million times. The employees of Weihai Factory decided to climb to the peak in one step from the ground, and designed and manufactured a stress shot peening machine.
    The factory transferred special personnel to form a commando team to build the "Three Machines". The "Three Machines" had thousands of parts and components, requiring processing equipment. The factory did not have enough machine tools, so they borrowed equipment from fraternal factories when they were resting. When trial-producing new machines, the factory did not have a suitable place, so they cleaned up the places where waste and coal were piled up, built a frame, and put on oilcloth, and worked under the oilcloth shed. In the hot weather, the shot peening machine body was like an oven, but they still drilled into the machine body to chisel, file, and scrape. During the typhoon and rainstorm season, after a rain, the site was muddy, and everyone continued to work in galoshes. Some parts and components were "repaired" bit by bit by the workers with chisels, files, and hand-held grinding wheels. The grinding wheel shook their hands numb, and they said: See if it can shake our bones apart! To create machinery and equipment, many people were truly "obsessed".
    In 1964, the "Three Machines" were manufactured, achieving the goal of "Three Olds" catching up with "Three News" and catching up with Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. In the national steel plate spring quality evaluation that year, Weihai Iron Factory was rated as a national advanced factory for new technology.
    Climbing one peak after another, the employees of Weihai Iron Factory are moving towards higher goals, and are determined to make more contributions to the country during the Third Five-Year Plan.

    厂小，革命志气不能小
    ——记上海卫海铁工厂从“大打铁铺”成为新技术先进单位的斗争
    上海有一个小工厂，设在芦席棚下，只有二百来人。九年来，他们高举毛泽东思想的红旗，不断革新生产技术，生产的钢板弹簧的质量，赶上了长春第一汽车制造厂同样产品的质量。这个小工厂名叫卫海铁工厂。
    抓阶级斗争促生产斗争
    一九五八年，卫海铁工厂的工人还成天与铁锤、风箱打交道，沿用着落后的方式生产。他们迫切要求从笨重的体力劳动中解放出来，迅速改变落后的生产面貌。虽然这些来自小打铁铺的职工有强烈的翻身感，但由于刚公私合营不久，没有进行过系统的社会主义教育，部分人自由散漫习气比较重，劳动纪律松弛，互相不团结。有些人对自己工作的意义认识不足，生产情绪不高。一支有觉悟的工人阶级队伍还没有形成。隐藏在工人阶级队伍中的个别反、坏分子兴风作浪，公开挑拨工人和党的关系，鼓动工人闹福利，闹奖金，并且散布“铁匠造机器，是癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉”之类的流言，动摇职工改变生产面貌的信心。
    这时，工厂党支部成立了，铁匠队伍有了一个领导核心。这个年轻的党支部一开始就要回答一个问题：是立即发动群众搞技术革命，还是首先组织阶级队伍，从提高职工的觉悟入手？
    他们在上级党组织的领导下，看到生产斗争与阶级斗争紧紧交织在一起，要想单纯地抓好生产是不可能的。于是决定狠抓阶级斗争，挑选了二十多个在旧社会苦大仇深、立场坚定的工人，作为阶级斗争的骨干，重点培养。同时放手发动群众，大张旗鼓地揭发批判了个别反、坏分子。职工们在这场斗争中提高了觉悟，分清了敌我，加强了团结。他们认识到，那些打着“为工人闹福利”旗号的人，原来是妄图把工人拉回受剥削受压迫的老路上去。这样，党和团的组织壮大了，一支骨干队伍开始培养出来，阶级队伍初步纯洁了。支部又向工人进行了深入细致的思想教育，大讲社会主义和工人阶级的任务，大讲组织性、纪律性的重要。
    全厂职工觉悟普遍提高，要求改变落后生产方式的愿望更加强烈。但是，铁匠能不能造机器呢？有人妄自菲薄地说：“凭着斗大的字只识两箩，铁匠能造机器？”有人满怀信心地说：“我看能造！”第一个站出来说话的是江苗涛。这个抡大锤的一把手，年纪不过三十岁，已经打了十多年铁。他说：“铁匠一定要造机器，我们不能赤手空拳地建设社会主义。”“我们就是要吃天鹅肉，就是要为无产阶级争气！”
    党支部支持这个先进的苗子，组织顾耀祖等几个铁匠跟他一起，一定要把这一仗打响。几双打铁的手，拿起了粉笔，围在地上画草图，作模型，经过半年多的摸索，终于造出了一台卷耳机。铁匠造的第一台机器是粗糙的，但是给大家破了迷信，壮了胆量。党支部抓住这件事，在厂里大宣传，大长无产阶级的志气。全厂出现了技术革命的热潮，造出了一台台的专用设备。
    疾风知劲草
    在连续三年遭受严重自然灾害的年月里，卫海铁工厂面临了原材料不足、燃料不足、生产任务不足等困难。那时，产品有三分之二是等外品，三分之一是二等品。一部分工人支援外地、支援农村去了，从其它一些厂调来的工人嫌这里生产条件差，不安心工作。这是一场严峻的考验。是抱积极的态度，知难而进，还是消极悲观，畏难退缩？疾风知劲草。卫海铁工厂的职工更高地举起了总路线的红旗，大家回忆对比，忆苦思甜，大讲毛泽东思想，激发革命热情。
    在全厂职工大会上，党支部书记李玉林谈自己从小给地主作长工的悲惨遭遇。他的话音刚完，一个个工人都激动地站起来诉苦。这些在旧社会被称作“臭铁匠”的人，都有一肚子苦水。工人冯贵堂拉开衣服，指着肚子上的伤痕，控诉了旧社会的罪恶。解放前，飞溅出来的红铁钉嵌在他的肚子上，老板不给医治，他只能用报纸贴在溃烂的伤口上，最后还是被一脚踢开，流落到农村讨饭。
    回忆旧社会，越忆越苦；对比新社会，越比越甜。大家从议论中议出了一个坚决克服困难的精神面貌。干部和工人，两个苦瓜一根藤，在困难面前，亲密无间，无所畏惧。钢板弹簧的任务不足，他们主动承接了其他大型设备的加工任务。
    他们又努力提高钢板弹簧的质量。干部和工人一起，大讲大议提高质量的意义。群众性的摸索钢板弹簧生产规律的科学实验活动，在全厂展开了。
    卫海铁工厂工人大部分被旧社会剥夺了学文化的权利，干活多凭自己的经验，因此操作很不统一。工人出身的副厂长吴庙祥，从小也只读过五年书，对制造钢板弹簧的好多道理同样不懂。他带着几个人，在热处理工段观察每一个老师傅的操作，并如实地把三个技术最好的工人的操作描绘记录下来，又组织群众反复总结、讨论，最后制订了四十一条热处理工艺。制造钢板弹簧的四十多道工序，就这样都有了新的工艺操作规程。一套严格的检验制度也建立起来了；一套科学的测试设备也依靠自己的力量制造出来了。
    卫海铁工厂的产品质量从此迅速提高。单片钢板弹簧的寿命，从七、八万次提高到二十五万次。一九六三年度全国钢板弹簧质量评比（长春第一汽车制造厂没有参加评比），卫海铁工厂产品的质量被评为先进。
    技术革命持续不断。到一九六三年，自己制造的设备增加到五十多台，全厂百分之八十五的操作实现了机械化、半自动化。
    “三老”赶“三新”
    钢板弹簧的质量被评为先进，来参观学习的人多了，表扬多了，部分职工中自满情绪暗暗滋长。有人说：“这下可说是钢板大王了。”
    不能停止前进的脚步！党支部组织全厂职工学习了毛主席关于“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导。职工们把自己的钢板弹簧质量，跟国内最先进的长春第一汽车厂比，比出了六项差距；与世界先进水平比，差距更大。经过群众的酝酿讨论，工厂领导上及时提出：首先在一九六四年内赶上长春！
    卫海铁工厂的设备面貌跟创业时比，是大不相同了；可是跟长春第一汽车厂比，毕竟还差得远。有人说，长春是“三新”——现代化的厂房，现代化的设备，第一流的技术队伍。我们是“三老”——厂房“老”，三分之二是芦席棚；设备“老”，绝大部分是土设备；人也“老”，文化水平低。“三老”怎么能赶“三新”呢？
    小厂能不能赶上和超过大厂？卫海铁工厂的职工们从学习大庆和解放军的革命精神的过程中，看到了这种可能。职工们说：“大庆人头顶青天，脚踏草原，凭着一股革命志气，赶上了世界先进水平，建成了技术第一流的大油田。我们头上还有芦席棚，脚下还有煤渣地，条件比大庆好，为什么赶不上长春？”大家分析：“三老”是赶长春的不利条件，但是也有有利方面：设备是自制的土设备，专用性强，工人使用熟悉；厂房破旧，可以激发自力更生的精神；老工人在旧社会受苦深，阶级觉悟高。于是，卫海职工提出：“头顶芦席棚，脚踏煤渣地，立下愚公志，三老赶三新。”
    要消灭与长春的六个质量差距，关键在于制造“三机”：造出喷丸机；造出更高水平的卷耳机；造出一批新型的淬火机。喷丸处理是一种表面强化的新工艺，就是用大量象菜籽般大小的钢丸，以很高的速度打击钢板弹簧的表面。当时卫海铁工厂没有喷丸机，生产的单片钢板弹簧，在疲劳试验机上连续弯曲二十五万次就断了。如果造一般喷丸机，可以延长到六十万次以上。如果造世界上才出现不久的一种更高级的应力喷丸机，则可以延长到一百万次以上。卫海厂职工决心从平地一步登上高峰，设计、制造应力喷丸机。
    全厂抽调专人组成了造“三机”的突击队。“三机”的零部件上千，需要有加工设备。厂里没有足够的机床，他们趁兄弟厂休息的时候，借人家的设备干。试制新的机器，厂里没有合适的场所，他们把堆废料、堆煤的地方清理干净，搭个架子，拉上油布，就在油布棚下干。大热天，喷丸机机身象个烘箱，他们还是钻进机身去凿、去锉、去刮。台风暴雨的季节，一阵雨过，场地一片泥泞，大家还穿着套鞋继续干。有的零部件，是工人们用凿子凿、锉刀锉、手提砂轮磨，一点一滴“修”出来的。砂轮震得手发麻，他们说：看它还能震得散我们的骨头！为了创造机器设备，许多人真是着了“迷”一样。
    一九六四年，“三机”制造了出来，实现了“三老”赶“三新”的目标，赶上了长春第一汽车厂。这一年度全国钢板弹簧质量评比，卫海铁工厂被评为全国新技术先进厂。
    攀了一峰又一峰，卫海铁工厂的职工正在向更高的目标前进，决心在第三个五年计划期间为国家做出更多的贡献。
