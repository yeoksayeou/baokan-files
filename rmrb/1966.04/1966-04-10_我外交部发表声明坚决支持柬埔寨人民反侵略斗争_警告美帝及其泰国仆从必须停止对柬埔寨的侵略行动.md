    Our Foreign Ministry Issues Statement Firmly Supporting the Cambodian People's Anti-Aggression Struggle
    Warns US Imperialism and its Thai Lackeys to Cease Aggression Against Cambodia
    Xinhua News Agency, April 9th. The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement on April 9th, expressing firm support for the Kingdom of Cambodia government and people's solemn position against Thailand's acts of aggression against Cambodia. The full text of the statement is as follows:
    Statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
                        April 9, 1966
    On the night of April 3rd, a Thai army invaded the province of Preah Vihear in Cambodia, attacking and burning the Cambodian guard post at the ancient temple of Prasat Preah Vihear in the area of Long Dum, and abducting five guards from the post. This is yet another serious act of aggression by US imperialism, instigated by its lackey Thailand, against the Kingdom of Cambodia. On April 7th, the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia issued a statement, severely condemning the Thai aggressors and demanding that all justice-upholding and peace-loving countries stop Thailand's acts of war against Cambodia. The Chinese government and the Chinese people resolutely support this solemn position of the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia.
    In order to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam to the entire Indochina, US imperialism is stepping up its use of the Thai reactionaries as its accomplices. In recent times, under the direction of US imperialism, the Thai army has carried out a series of aggressive and provocative activities against the Kingdom of Cambodia. The Thai authorities have continuously issued clamorous statements, falsely accusing the peace-loving Kingdom of Cambodia of posing a serious threat to Thailand. After Thai Prime Minister Thanom's visit to Vientiane at the end of March, the Thai military and political leaders repeatedly clamored for cooperation with the Lao right wing to launch attacks against the Lao liberated areas and the Kingdom of Cambodia, in coordination with the United States. All of this shows that the Thai army's attack on the Long Dum outpost in Cambodia was entirely a premeditated action by US imperialism and the Thai reactionaries. As the statement of the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia pointed out, this is "a prelude to a large-scale aggression against Cambodia."
    The Thai army's attack on the Long Dum outpost in Cambodia is a blatant act of aggression. The location of the Long Dum outpost belongs to the sovereign territory of the Kingdom of Cambodia, which is internationally recognized. The Thai authorities, on the one hand, verbally acknowledge this fact; on the other hand, they send troops to attack the Cambodian outpost there and at one point occupied the Long Dum Temple. This once again exposes the territorial ambitions of the Thai reactionaries toward the Kingdom of Cambodia. The purpose of the Thai authorities is very clear, that is, to attempt to fish in troubled waters in the US expansion of the Indochina war.
    The heroic Cambodian army and people, under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, have resolutely repelled every invasion and provocation by US imperialism and its lackeys, striking at the arrogance of the aggressors and defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Cambodia. In this invasion incident, the armed forces of the Kingdom of Cambodia repelled the Thai army's attack, recovered the Long Dum Temple, and once again achieved a major victory. The Chinese government and the Chinese people resolutely support the just struggle of the Cambodian people against aggression, and warn US imperialism and its Thai lackeys that they must stop their acts of aggression against the Kingdom of Cambodia, otherwise, they will surely eat their own bitter fruit.

    我外交部发表声明坚决支持柬埔寨人民反侵略斗争
    警告美帝及其泰国仆从必须停止对柬埔寨的侵略行动
    新华社九日讯　中国外交部九日发表声明，表示坚决支持柬埔寨王国政府和人民反对泰国对柬埔寨的侵略行动的严正立场。声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国外交部声明
                        一九六六年四月九日
    四月三日夜晚，一支泰国军队侵入柬埔寨柏威夏省，袭击和烧毁了隆端古寺的柬埔寨哨所，劫走了哨所的五名守卫者。这是美帝国主义唆使它的仆从泰国对柬埔寨王国的又一次严重的侵略行为。四月七日，柬埔寨王国政府发表声明，严厉谴责泰国侵略者，要求所有主持正义和爱好和平的国家制止泰国对柬埔寨的战争行动。中国政府和中国人民坚决支持柬埔寨王国政府的这一严正立场。
    美帝国主义为了把侵略越南的战争扩大到整个印度支那，正在加紧利用泰国反动派作为它的帮凶。最近一个时期以来，在美帝国主义的指使下，泰国军队对柬埔寨王国进行了一系列的侵略和挑衅活动。泰国当局不断发出叫嚣，诬蔑爱好和平的柬埔寨王国是对泰国的严重威胁。三月底泰国总理他侬访问万象后，泰国的军政头目竟然一再叫嚷要和老挝右派合作，配合美国向老挝解放区和柬埔寨王国发动进攻。这一切表明，泰国军队对柬埔寨隆端古寺哨所的袭击完全是美帝国主义和泰国反动派预谋的行动。正如柬埔寨王国政府的声明中所指出的，这是“对柬埔寨进行大规模侵略的前奏”。
    泰国军队对柬埔寨隆端古寺哨所的袭击，是明目张胆的侵略行为。隆端古寺的所在地属于柬埔寨王国的领土主权，这是国际上所公认的。泰国当局一方面口头上承认这个事实；另一方面却派军队进攻在这里的柬埔寨哨所，并且一度占领隆端古寺。这就再一次暴露了泰国反动派对柬埔寨王国的领土野心。泰国当局的目的是很清楚的，那就是企图在美国扩大印度支那的战争中混水摸鱼。
    英勇的柬埔寨军民，在诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王领导下，对于美帝国主义及其仆从的每一次入侵和挑衅，都给予了坚决的回击，打击了侵略者的气焰，捍卫了柬埔寨王国的主权和领土完整。在这次入侵事件中，柬埔寨王国的武装部队打退了泰国军队的进攻，收复了隆端古寺，又一次取得了重大的胜利。中国政府和中国人民坚决支持柬埔寨人民反侵略的正义斗争，并且警告美帝国主义及其泰国仆从，必须停止对柬埔寨王国的侵略行动，否则，他们必将自食其果。
