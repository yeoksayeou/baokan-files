    Spring is Strong in the Workshop
    Bian Xiangyu, Worker of Anhui Hydraulic Machinery Factory
    Tall pines on high mountains defy frost,
    The proletariat's fighting spirit soars,
    Resolved to have the determination of the Foolish Old Man who moved mountains,
    Vowing to compete with the bitter winter.
    Foundry workers pat their chests,
    Shedding their cotton coats, they grab the pneumatic drills,
    With a loud shout, difficulties retreat,
    Each and every one is a fierce tiger.
    Golden light flashes before the melting furnace,
    The red iron stream flows with a whoosh;
    Heroic hands wield the furnace-poking bar,
    The cold air is scared back three zhang!
    Cranes dance iron hooks up and down,
    Ringing sounds echo in the air,
    Like a frontline transportation team,
    Lifting boxes busy transporting sand.
    Spring is strong in the workshop,
    Labor enthusiasm melts the frost,
    The Third Five-Year Plan will surely be realized,
    Hold high the red flag and get to work!

    车间里面春意浓
    安徽水利机械厂工人　卞相玉
    高山青松傲冰霜，
    无产阶级斗志昂，
    立下愚公移山志，
    誓与寒冬比高强。
    翻砂工人拍胸膛，
    脱去棉衣拿风枪，
    大喝一声困难退，
    个个都是猛虎将。
    熔化炉前闪金光，
    红色铁流哗哗淌；
    英雄手执刺炉钎，
    吓得寒气退三丈！
    吊车上下舞铁钩，
    空中铃声阵阵响，
    好似前线运输队，
    吊箱运砂来回忙。
    车间里面春意浓，
    劳动热情溶冰霜，
    第三个五年计划定实现，
    高举红旗干一场。
