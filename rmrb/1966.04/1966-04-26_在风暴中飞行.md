    Flying in a Storm	Liao Xunrang
    Late at night, a gale swept across the Yellow Sea.
    In the duty room of the leading organ of a certain army unit stationed on the coast of the Yellow Sea, frequent communications were being conducted with the guard company on an island far from the mainland, anxiously inquiring about the condition of Gu Furong, the guard company cook suffering from acute appendicitis:
    "How is the situation now?"
    "He is in a semi-comatose state, with the possibility of developing toxic shock. If he cannot be sent back to the mainland for surgery by tomorrow morning, then..."
      "The transport boat sent to pick up the patient has already departed, please do not worry!"
    However, the transport boat sent to pick up the patient was forced back by the storm as soon as it left the port. The leading officers anxiously waiting in the duty room placed their hopes on the second large transport boat that was sent, but unexpectedly, the large transport boat also lost speed in the storm.
    This news quickly reached the duty room of a certain naval unit. Thus, a battle to rescue class brothers with a helicopter urgently unfolded...
    Two red signal flares shot from the control tower burned fiercely in the sky above the airport. The on-duty crew of aircraft 02, like a whirlwind, quickly gathered around the aircraft from the apron where they were waiting for orders. Captain Wang Xin勋 excitedly made a pre-flight mobilization speech to the crew.
    The engine roared, and the rotor spun. In an instant, the helicopter flew towards the airspace above the island.
    The wind speed was increasing, and the airflow was fluctuating. The pointers of the aircraft's level and altimeter moved back and forth incessantly. Wang Xin勋 gripped the control stick tightly, constantly correcting the course deviation. Whenever the aircraft was slightly more stable, he tilted the rotor forward to the maximum position to increase the aircraft's speed. From the aircraft's bursts of abnormal shaking, he realized that the entire crew was seizing the time to practice lowering the stretcher, attaching the steel cable, and positioning the patient.
    The grueling flight passed. The small island surrounded by waves was clearly reflected on the cockpit glass. Wang Xin勋 happily announced loudly to the crew:
    "Entering the target area, prepare to land."
    After speaking, he lowered the altitude and circled the island once, looking for a landing site. He saw army comrades standing all over the island, on the island and below, in front of and behind the houses, waving their arms and excitedly greeting the sky. Wang Xin勋 looked all over the island, but couldn't find a place to land. He immediately issued the order to the crew to hover and lower the stretcher to pick up the patient.
    The aircraft attempted to hover seven times in succession, but was unsuccessful. It was either blown out to sea by the northwest wind or pushed towards the rocky cliffs by irregular airflow. Wang Xin勋 bit his teeth, steeled his nerves, and began the eighth entry into the target area.
    Learning from the previous attempts, he did not forcibly enter the target area, but instead slowly lowered the altitude along the wind direction outside the island. The aircraft smoothly sideslipped to the hovering position. Just as Wang Xin勋 was about to stop the speed, the aircraft suddenly shook violently. Based on his feeling, Wang Xin勋 knew that he was in the center of a very strong airflow. If he didn't counter the airflow and exit, he wouldn't be able to escape the danger at all. He decisively made a sharp ascent. The aircraft, taking advantage of the airflow lift, crossed the overhanging cliff and shot straight into the high sky. The bulging belly of the aircraft almost grazed the overhanging cliff.
    The aircraft rose for a while and gradually stabilized. The fully focused Wang Xin勋 immediately realized that this was an abnormal phenomenon in flight in bad weather. Sure enough, as expected, the aircraft, having escaped the airflow, suddenly lost its powerful support and began to descend rapidly. The roar of the sea overwhelmed the engine's rumble. Wang Xin勋 used all his strength to forcefully increase the throttle pitch, but he couldn't exert any force in the violent bumps. Seeing the approaching wave crest about to smash the aircraft into the surging sea, at this tense moment, Wang Xin勋 felt as if his left hand was lifting into empty space, and the throttle pitch was very easily raised. The rotor spun at an even faster speed, screaming, and suddenly brought the aircraft into the air.
    This battle with the bad weather exhausted Wang Xin勋 so much that beads of sweat the size of beans fell from his forehead in strings, stinging his eyes. Just as he was about to free his hand to wipe the sweat, someone gently wiped his face with a soft towel. Wang Xin勋 looked and saw that it was Deputy Commander Xia, sitting in the co-pilot's seat, his left hand still tightly gripping the throttle pitch grip. Ah! So, in the emergency just now, Deputy Commander Xia had helped him raise the throttle pitch. Wang Xin勋 gratefully looked at Deputy Commander Xia's gaze filled with trust and expectation, and really wanted to say something, but as soon as he opened his mouth, he felt a surge of acid rising up, and his temples ached like they were being clamped with pliers. Deputy Commander Xia hurriedly stopped him from speaking, while kindly pointing to the lower right of the cockpit glass. Wang Xin勋 turned his eyes and saw a red banner dazzlingly:
    "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice and surmount every difficulty to win victory."
    He didn't know how many times he had read this sentence, but now he felt it was particularly cordial, and his spirit was lifted. He opened the intercom switch and encouraged the comrades in the crew:
    "Keep Chairman Mao's teachings firmly in mind, and resolutely complete the task. Prepare to enter again."
    The enormous spiritual strength overcame one danger after another, and the aircraft finally hovered successfully. Wang Xin勋 issued instructions:
    "Open the hatch and lower the stretcher."
    Xiao Chang抢 [搶 – compete to do something] eagerly replied:
    "Understood. I request to go down on the rope ladder first to take care of the patient getting on board."
    "Good!"
    The rope ladder was thrown out of the hatch. Xiao Chang climbed down to the ground along the swinging rope ladder, and when he and the guard company cadres carried the patient to the bottom of the aircraft, Xiao Liu had already lowered the stretcher with the steel cable.
    From the headphones came gasping sounds of "huff, huff," and Wang Xin勋 knew that Xiao Liu was laboriously cranking the stretcher into the cockpit. Suddenly, Xiao Liu said "ouch," and Wang Xin勋 hurriedly asked, "Xiao Liu, what's wrong?"
    After a while, he heard Xiao Liu reply: "It's nothing, everything is normal."
    It turned out that when he was cranking the winch, the aircraft shook, causing him to lose his balance. He didn't hold the winch handle tightly and it snapped back. Xiao Liu saw this and panicked. He rushed over and used his chest to brace the crank. The crank hit his chest, and both of his arms were also numbed. He endured the pain in his chest and insisted on cranking the stretcher into the cockpit.
    Wang Xin勋 reported to the control tower:
    "Aircraft 02 has safely completed the task of loading the patient and requests to return."
    "Aircraft 02 can return, proceed quickly to the military hospital to land."
    "Understood."
    The rotor spun, the clouds flashed by, and Wang Xin勋's crew overcame many difficulties that day and finally rescued the lives of their army comrades.

    在风暴中飞行	廖训让
    深夜，大风浪席卷黄海。
    黄海岸陆军某部队首长值班室，正与远离大陆的岛上守备连进行频繁的通讯联络，关切地询问急性阑尾炎患者、守备连炊事员顾福荣的病情：
    “现在情况怎么样？”
    “呈半昏迷状态，有产生中毒性休克的可能。如果明天上午不能送回大陆开刀，就……”
      “派去接病人的运输艇已经出发，你们千万不要着急！”
    可是，接运病人的运输艇刚驶出港口就被风浪顶了回来。紧张守候在值班室的首长，把希望寄托在第二次派出的大型运输艇上，不料，大型运输艇也在风浪中失速。
    这消息飞快传到海军某部作战值班室。于是，一场用直升飞机营救阶级兄弟的战斗，紧急地展开了……
    塔台打出的两颗红色信号弹，在机场上空急剧燃烧，值班的02号机组人员，象一阵旋风似的，从待命出发的停机坪四周，迅速聚集到飞机前。机长王新勋激动地向机组人员作飞行前动员。
    马达轰鸣，旋翼飞转。刹时，直升飞机便朝着海岛上空飞驶而去。
    风速在增大，气流起伏不定，飞机水平仪和高度表的指针来回不停地变动。王新勋紧握驾驶杆，不断修正航向偏差，只要飞机稍平稳些，就把旋翼向前倾斜到最大位置，以增加飞机速度。从飞机一阵阵异常的晃动中，他觉出了这是全机组同志在抓紧时间练习放救护椅，绞钢缆，安放病人的动作。
    难熬的途中飞行过去了。被海浪围住的小海岛，清楚地映现在罩舱玻璃上。王新勋高兴得大声通知机组人员：
    “进入目标，准备降落。”
    说完，便降低高度绕岛一周，寻找降落场地。只见岛上岛下，房前房后站满了陆军战友，他们挥动手臂，兴奋地向空中招呼着。王新勋把海岛看了个遍，但找不到一块能降落的地方。他马上向机组人员发出了悬停，放下救护椅接病人上飞机的命令。
    飞机连续试探着悬停了七次，都没有成功，不是被西北风刮出海岛，就是被不规则的气流冲向岩壁。王新勋把牙一咬，狠劲定了定神，开始第八次进入目标。
    他接受上几次的教训，不强行进入目标，改成在岛外顺着风势慢慢降低高度。飞机很顺利地侧滑到悬停位置。王新勋正要刹住速度，飞机突然猛烈一晃。凭感觉，王新勋知道这是一股很强烈的气流中心冲来了，如果不顶着气流退出，根本摆脱不了危险，他果断地来了个急剧跃升动作，飞机趁着气流升力，越过悬岩，直插高空。飞机鼓出的腹部，几乎是贴着悬岩擦了过去。
    飞机上升了一会，渐渐平稳起来，全神贯注的王新勋马上警觉出这是恶劣气候中飞行的反常现象。果然不出所料，飞机由于摆脱了气流，突然失去了有力的托举，开始快速下降。大海咆哮声盖过了马达的轰鸣。王新勋使出全身力量猛提油门变距，可是在猛烈地颠簸中怎么也使不上劲。眼看前面倾泻而来的浪峰，要把飞机砸入白浪汹涌的大海，就在这紧张时刻，王新勋感到左手象是提空了一样，油门变距很轻快地被提了上来，旋翼以更快的速度旋转着，嘶叫着，把飞机猛然带向空中。
    这一场与恶劣气候的搏斗，把王新勋累得豆大的汗珠由额上成串往下掉，渍得眼睛都发痛。他刚想腾出手擦擦汗，有人用一团柔软的毛巾从他脸上轻轻揩过，王新勋一看，是坐在副驾驶位置上的夏副部队长，他的左手还紧握在油门变距握把上。啊！原来刚才紧急时刻，是夏副部队长帮助他提上了油门变距。王新勋感激地看着夏副部队长那充满信任和期望的目光，真想说几句什么，可是刚要张口，就有一股酸水要往外喷，太阳穴象被钳子夹住一样痛得钻心。夏副部队长急忙制止他讲话，一边亲切地指了指罩舱玻璃右下方。王新勋转眼看去，一条红色标语光彩夺目：
    “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    这句话他不知道读到过多少次了，但现在觉得倍加亲切，不由精神为之一振，他打开机内通话开关鼓励机组的同志：
    “牢记毛主席教导，坚决完成任务。准备再次进入。”
    巨大的精神力量，战胜了一次又一次的危险，飞机终于悬停成功了。王新勋发出指示：
    “打开舱门，放救护椅。”
    小常抢着回答：
    “明白。我请求放软梯先下去，好照顾病人上机。”
    “好！”
    软梯从舱门抛了出来，小常顺着甩来甩去的软梯连攀带哧溜地爬到地面，当他同守备连的干部把病人抬到机下时，小刘早已用钢缆放下救护椅。
    从耳机里传来“吭哧吭哧”的喘息，王新勋知道小刘正吃力地往坐舱绞救护椅。忽然间，小刘“哎哟”了一声，王新勋急忙问：“小刘，怎么啦？”
    好一会才听到小刘回答：“没什么，一切正常。”
    原来，刚才摇绞盘时，由于飞机晃动，使身体失去了平衡，绞盘握把一时没握住，吧哒一下倒了回来。小刘一看急了，忙扑过去用胸脯抵住摇把，摇把打着了他的胸脯，两臂也被震得发麻。他强忍住胸脯的疼痛，坚持把救护椅绞进坐舱。
    王新勋向塔台报告：
    “02号安全完成装载病人任务，请求返航。”
    “02号可以返航，迅速到军医院降落。”
    “明白。”
    旋翼飞转，云雾闪道，王新勋机组这天冲破了重重困难，终于抢救出陆军战友的生命。
