    The Tramplers of the Bandung Principles	By Our Commentator
    The Indonesian right-wing has recently launched a massive attack on China, accusing it of "deviating from the Bandung Principles" and "interfering" in Indonesia's "internal affairs." What factual basis have they presented for such outcry? None whatsoever. The only "basis" they have put forward is the objective and truthful reporting by Xinhua News Agency and Radio Beijing on the drastic changes in the Indonesian political situation over the past six months.
    This anti-China pretext fabricated by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces, which they consider extremely clever, is in fact utterly clumsy!
    The military coup launched by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces and the drastic changes in the Indonesian political situation are facts known to the world. Over the past six months, news agencies and newspapers of various countries have made extensive reports and, from their respective standpoints, have carried out extensive commentaries. Even the Japanese bourgeois newspapers said that after the right-wing forces of the army forced the palace on March 11, they organized a new cabinet, thereby "suspending" Sukarno's position and "fixing the Nasution-Suharto system." The propaganda machine of U.S. imperialism nakedly applauded the Indonesian right-wing's seizure of power, gloatingly clamoring that power in Indonesia "has unmistakably passed into the hands of the army" and that Sukarno has been "kept in his gilded cage." Then, may we ask the Indonesian authorities, why can news agencies and newspapers of various countries publish such and such reports and commentaries on the Indonesian political situation, while only the Chinese press cannot do so?
    The Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces have been frantically anti-communist and anti-people domestically for more than six months, carrying out an unprecedented massacre, which is also an ironclad fact. Even the U.S. imperialists, the masters of the Indonesian right-wing, admit this is a fact. An article by Sulzberger from Jakarta published in The New York Times on April 13 stated that "one of the most serious massacres in history has not ended in Indonesia." Regarding the number of people killed by the right-wing, Sulzberger said, "A prudent diplomat estimates the total number at 300,000. Other estimates are even higher." Since the Indonesian right-wing is recklessly venting its bloodthirsty frenzy, brutally massacring Indonesian communists and patriotic people, and staining this archipelago with blood, then why can't the Chinese news agencies report it truthfully?
    The Indonesian right-wing is frantically anti-China and anti-Chinese, creating a large number of fascist atrocities, which is also an iron fact. How can the Chinese news agencies remain indifferent to the persecution and massacre of their own overseas Chinese and to the unbridled infringement upon their country's sovereignty and dignity? Of course, we have even more right to expose these fascist atrocities.
    To put it bluntly, the reason why the Indonesian right-wing forces are attacking and slandering China is to force China to change its principled stand against imperialism and colonialism, and to force China to change its stand of supporting the just struggle of the Indonesian people. They vainly attempt to force the Chinese people to remain silent about their bloody crimes against communism and the people, and to remain silent about their fascist anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities. However, the Indonesian right-wing must be warned that this is absolutely impossible.
    May we ask you, Indonesian right-wing gentlemen, who exactly is "deviating from the Bandung Principles" and who is interfering in other countries' "internal affairs"?
    Since the beginning of October last year, you have been anti-China and anti-Chinese every day, persecuting and massacring overseas Chinese, and even brazenly attacking the Chinese embassy, setting fires and committing violence, and destroying and seizing our consulates general. You have organized thugs to paint and shout anti-China slogans and slogans such as "Smash the People's Republic of China," "Hang the Chinamen," and "Kill all the Chinamen" on the streets of Jakarta, inciting fascist racist sentiments. You have also used the newspapers, news agencies, and radio stations under your control to launch vicious attacks on China every day, denouncing China as "China colonialism," "communist imperialism," and "yellow peril," and even wantonly insulting Chinese leaders. You have spread rumors that China is carrying out "planned mass massacres" domestically, that "the Beijing regime has failed in agriculture," and slandered China's education system as "forced" "political control," and openly shed tears for the complete demise of the feudal serf system in the Tibet region of China, and falsely accused China of "curtailing the basic rights of the Tibetan people." On April 18, Balan, chairman of the Indonesian right-wing Islamic Student Association, even clamored about giving the people of the Tibet region and Taiwan province of China "the right to self-determination." Aren't these frantic anti-China acts and shouts of yours deviating from the Bandung Principles, infringing upon Chinese sovereignty, and interfering in China's internal affairs?
    Frankly speaking, the Indonesian right-wing gentlemen are simply not qualified to talk about the Bandung Principles. The basic spirit of the Bandung Principles is that Asian and African countries unite to jointly oppose imperialism and new and old colonialism. However, you are faithful agents of U.S. imperialism and thorough reactionaries. You sell yourselves to U.S. imperialism, frantically oppose China, and attempt to undermine the Asian-African solidarity against imperialism. Is it not you who are shamefully trampling on the Bandung Principles and insulting the glorious name of Bandung? We advise the Indonesian right-wing leaders to put away your clumsy tricks!

    万隆原则的践踏者	本报评论员
    印度尼西亚右派最近大肆攻击中国“背离万隆原则”，“干涉”印度尼西亚“内政”。他们这样大叫大喊，究竟拿出什么事实根据呢？一件也拿不出。他们拿出来的唯一“根据”，无非是新华社和北京电台对于半年多来印度尼西亚政局的急剧演变，作了客观的、如实的报道。
    印度尼西亚右派反动势力制造出来的这个反华借口，自以为十分高明，其实是拙劣之至！
    印度尼西亚右派反动势力发动的军事政变和印度尼西亚政局的急剧变化，这是举世皆知的事实。半年多以来，世界各国的通讯社和报刊作了大量的报道，并从各自的立场出发，进行了广泛的评论。就连日本资产阶级报刊也说，陆军右派势力在三月十一日逼宫后，组织了新内阁，从而把苏加诺的地位“悬空起来”，“把纳苏蒂安—苏哈托的体制固定下来”。而美帝国主义的宣传机器则赤裸裸地为印度尼西亚右派夺取政权拍手叫好，它们得意地叫嚷，印度尼西亚的权力“已经明白无误地转入陆军手中”，苏加诺被“留在他的金丝笼中”。那末，试问印度尼西亚当局，为什么世界各国的通讯社和报刊都可以对印度尼西亚的政局发表这样和那样的报道和评论，而唯独中国的新闻界不可以这样做呢？
    印度尼西亚右派反动势力这半年多来在国内疯狂反共反人民，进行空前规模的大屠杀，这也是铁一般的事实。就连印度尼西亚右派的主子美帝国主义者也承认这是事实。四月十三日《纽约时报》刊登了苏兹贝格从雅加达发出的一篇文章就说，“历史上最严重的一次屠杀在印度尼西亚尚未结束”。关于右派杀人的数字，苏兹贝格说，“一位谨慎的外交人士估计总数是三十万。其它的估计还要高。”既然印度尼西亚右派不顾一切地发泄自己的嗜血狂，野蛮屠杀印度尼西亚共产党人和爱国人民，血染这千岛之国，那末，为什么中国的新闻机关不能如实地加以报道呢？
    印度尼西亚右派疯狂反华和排华，制造了大量的法西斯暴行，这也是铁的事实。中国的新闻机关怎么能够对自己的侨胞遭到迫害和屠杀，对自己国家的主权和尊严遭到肆无忌惮的侵犯而无动于衷呢？我们当然更有权利对这些法西斯暴行进行揭露。
    说穿了，印度尼西亚右派势力所以大肆攻击和诬蔑中国，目的是要迫使中国改变反对帝国主义和殖民主义的原则立场，迫使中国改变支持印度尼西亚人民正义斗争的立场。他们妄想迫使中国人民对他们反共反人民的血腥罪行默不作声，对他们反华、排华的法西斯暴行默不作声。但是，必须正告印度尼西亚的右派，这是绝对办不到的。
    请问印度尼西亚右派先生们，究竟谁在“背离万隆原则”，谁在干涉别国的“内政”呢？
    你们自从去年十月初以来，天天都在反华和排华，迫害和屠杀华侨，甚至明目张胆地袭击中国大使馆，放火行凶，捣毁和强占我国的总领事馆。你们组织暴徒在雅加达的街头涂写和叫喊“粉碎中华人民共和国”、“吊死支那人”、“杀光支那人”等等的反华标语和口号，煽动法西斯种族主义情绪。你们还利用自己掌握的报刊、通讯社和电台，天天都在对中国进行恶毒的攻击，辱骂中国为“支那殖民主义”、“共产帝国主义”、“黄祸”，甚至对中国领导人进行放肆的侮辱。你们造谣说，中国在国内进行“有计划的群众性屠杀”、“北京政权在农业方面已经失败”，诬蔑中国的教育制度是“强迫”的“政治控制”，并且公然为中国西藏地方封建农奴制度的彻底灭亡而掉泪，诬蔑中国“遏制西藏人民的基本权利”。四月十八日，印度尼西亚右派伊斯兰学联主席巴兰还叫嚷说什么要给中国西藏地方和台湾省的人民以“自决权”。你们的这些疯狂反华的行径和叫嚷，难道不是背离万隆原则，侵犯中国主权，干涉中国内政吗？
    老实说，印度尼西亚右派先生们根本没有资格谈论万隆原则。万隆原则的基本精神就是亚非国家团结起来，共同反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义。可是，你们是美帝国主义的忠实代理人，是十足的反动派。你们卖身投靠美帝国主义，大肆反华，力图破坏亚非团结反帝事业。难道不正是你们，可耻地践踏了万隆原则，侮辱了万隆这个光荣的名称吗？奉劝印度尼西亚的右派头目们，还是收起你们的这套拙劣的把戏吧！
