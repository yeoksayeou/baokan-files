    奥博特宣誓就任乌干达总统
    新华社十六日讯　坎帕拉消息：乌干达前总理密尔顿·奥博特十五日下午在乌干达国民议会宣誓就任乌干达总统。
    在乌干达国民议会十五日会议上废除了旧宪法，并以压倒多数的赞成票批准了新宪法。根据新宪法的规定，乌干达执政党领导人将是乌干达总统，总统是国家元首和军队总司令。奥博特是执政的乌干达人民大会党主席。
    在奥博特宣誓就职后，乌干达的内阁部长和国民议会议员也宣誓保证忠于新宪法。
    在这之前，奥博特向议会发表讲话说，根据新宪法，国民议会将是乌干达的最高立法机构，旧宪法规定的联邦制度将予以废除。被废除的乌干达旧宪法是在乌干达独立前由英国政府起草的。根据旧宪法规定，国家的主要执行机构是以总理为首的内阁。
    旧宪法是今年二月由前总理奥博特宣布暂时停止实行的，奥博特然后宣布接管乌干达前总统和副总统的权力。
