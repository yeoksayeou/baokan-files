    Wu Han Has Two Hearts With Us
    Peasant of Poor Background, Wu Changsheng, Taipingzhuang Brigade, Nankou Commune, Changping County

    These days, I've been seeing many materials exposing Wu Han in the newspapers. He keeps saying the old society was good, slandering the new society, and opposing the Communist Party. The more I read, the angrier I get. He says things like in the past there were “good officials” and also “good emperors.” This is really strange! I suffered decades of oppression and exploitation in the old society, and I never heard of any emperor being good, nor did I ever encounter a good official. I won't talk about other things, I’ll just talk about the past “good emperors” and “good officials” to see just how good they really were?

    We can't see emperors today, but I'll just talk about things we can see now. Take the Ming Tombs, for example, everyone can see them clearly, right? This is the "good thing" that "good emperors" left us. Look at its engineering, how massive it is. From the moment an emperor is born, they start building his tomb, which continues until he dies. I don't know how much money it cost. Where did that money come from? It’s all the money of us poor brothers, all the blood and sweat of us common people! In the Ming Tombs, so much gold and silver treasure is buried for the emperor to enjoy after death. You say there were "good emperors," and "good emperors" did this!

    Let's take the Great Wall. It is a great project in the world. To build the Great Wall, how many people had to labor, moving bricks and stones, working day and night, to build it. Why did the emperors of past dynasties build the Great Wall? Wasn’t it just the ruling class of one ethnic group preventing the invasion of the ruling class of another ethnic group. Poor people all over the world are one family, the people don't want to invade each other, nor do they need the Great Wall. Of course, the Great Wall was created by our working people, and it demonstrates the creative ability of the working people; at the same time, the Great Wall is our working people's indictment against emperors and generals. Why do I say this? Because the Great Wall is built with the bones of our ancestors, and the mortar is mixed with the blood of our working people. This was all forced by emperors and generals.

    The officials of the past were all of the same ilk as the emperors; they all drank the blood of the working people. They embraced the emperor's legs and rode on the heads of the common people; they were all disgusting things. Take Bao Zheng, for example. He also drank the blood of the working people and was a loyal subject of the emperor. You say he was good; in what way was he good? Why didn't he oppose the emperor? He was only racking his brains to be loyal to the emperor. When did he ever do anything good for the people? Officials were all for getting promoted and making a fortune; how could they work for the poor! They're like a carpenter's axe—chopping on one side, only chopping at us poor people, scraping our money. In the past, most people in our village couldn't get enough to eat, didn't have enough to wear, and suffered oppression. The puppet government levied taxes based on the number of acres of land. The poor people's land was thin, and one acre only yielded dozens of catties of grain, while the landlord's land was fertile, and one acre yielded hundreds of catties, but the poor and the landlord had to pay taxes the same way; you couldn't pay less. If the officials wanted fruit, they didn’t ask if you had fruit trees; you had to pay, even if you didn't have any. The poor suffered greatly. Have you ever seen an official see that the common people were poor and issue some money to provide relief? Which official let the poor children in the village go to school for free? They only knew how to drink the blood of the poor!

    Emperors and generals are all landlords, all exploiting class rulers. Getting to the root, from the day they were born, they were considered to have "good fortune." They were what were known as "princes," "dukes," and "young masters," and their "good fortune" was drinking our blood! How could these princelings speak for the poor when they grew up? During the Qing Dynasty, this area was all the imperial family's "banner land," and we only had the share of hard labor. When the prince's lackeys came to collect rent, from the high-ranking royal princes down to the low-ranking dogs and the petty landlords, they were all squeezing the marrow of the poor and sucking the blood of the poor. Let me give you an example of us chopping firewood. A strong laborer would get up in the middle of the night and go to the mountains twenty li away to chop a hundred catties of firewood. It would take a whole day to carry it back, and the next day to carry it to Changping to sell. Those "officials" who bought firewood not only ruthlessly suppressed the price, but also shaved a layer of skin off you on the steelyard. At that time, it was sixteen taels to a catty, but they used eighteen taels to a catty to buy it. As a result, after working for two days, you couldn't even buy a sheng of corn! From the emperor down to the petty officials, who wasn't extorting and oppressing us? We were poor because of this.

    In the old society, we never encountered a "good official," nor did we believe that kind of nonsense. Those landlords and bureaucrats caused my family to flee famine and beg for food, and I gave my two younger brothers away to others, and my younger sister became a child bride. If there were "good officials," why were we still so poor? Life is better now because the Communist Party and Chairman Mao led us to overthrow all the big and small landlords and officials.

    Wu Han speaks for the bourgeoisie, hates our Communist Party, and hates us poor and lower-middle peasants. He said that Hai Rui scolded the emperor. Who is Hai Rui? Hai Rui is him. If we all trusted him and followed him, where would we end up? We would only end up on the road of capitalist restoration. This is wanting us to go backwards, and still be beasts of burden! Although Wu Han has some education and can write articles, his heart is so poisonous!

    Wu Han and these people say that there were "good officials" and "good emperors" in the old society, and that Hai Rui was an "upright official." This is all nonsense. When discussing these things, we must see what their roots are, and which side they are standing on. These people were all born into wealth; in the past, they had clothes handed to them and food put in their mouths. Their feelings are different from those of us who were saved by the Party. They are people of the bourgeoisie, speaking for the landlords and the bourgeoisie, and their hearts are not with us. They want us to go back to being beasts of burden; it can't be done!

    吴晗同我们两条心	昌平县南口公社太平庄大队贫农　吴长生
    这些天，看到报上揭露的吴晗的许多材料。他尽说旧社会好，污蔑新社会，反对共产党。我越看越生气。他说什么过去有“好官”，也有“好皇帝”。这真是怪事儿！我在旧社会受了几十年压迫、剥削，也没有听说哪一个皇帝好，也没有碰上一个好官儿。别的我不讲，只讲讲过去的“好皇帝”、“好官儿”，看一看他们究竟是怎么个好法？
    皇帝今天看不到了，我只说现在看得见的东西。就拿十三陵来说，大家都可以清清楚楚看见了吧。这是“好皇帝”给我们留下的“好东西”。你看它的工程，是多么浩大。从皇帝一落生，就要修坟，一直修到他死。也不知花了多少钱。这钱打那儿来的？都是我们穷苦兄弟的钱，都是我们老百姓的血汗！十三陵里，埋了多少金银财宝供皇帝死后享受。说是有“好皇帝”，“好皇帝”就办这个事儿！
    我们再拿万里长城来说，它是世界上的一件伟大工程。修建万里长城，得多少人劳动，搬砖弄石，黑夜白天干活，才能修起来。历代帝王修建长城是为什么呢？还不是这一个民族的统治阶级防范另一个民族的统治阶级的侵略。天下穷人是一家，人民是不要互相侵略的，也不要长城。当然，长城是我们劳动人民创造的，它表现了劳动人民的创造能力；同时，长城是我们劳动人民控诉帝王将相的罪状。为什么这样说呢？因为，长城是我们祖先尸骨堆起来的，泥浆都是我们劳动人民的血和的。这都是帝王将相逼的。
    过去当官的也都跟帝王是一道苗，他们一样喝劳动人民的血。他们抱皇帝的腿，骑老百姓的头，都是些臭东西。就说老包吧，也是喝劳动人民的血，是皇帝佬的忠臣。说他好，他有哪一点好？怎么他不反对皇帝？净编着法儿为皇帝效忠，他什么时候为人民办过好事？官们都是为了升官、发财，怎么能为穷人办事！他们好比木匠的斧子——一边砍，净砍我们穷人，刮我们穷人的钱。过去我们村大多数人吃不饱，穿不暖，受压迫。伪政府依田亩数派款，穷人的地土薄，一亩地才打几十斤粮，地主的地土厚，一亩地打几百斤，可穷人和地主照样交款，少拿一点也不行。官们要果子，不问你有没有果树，交不上就不行。穷人吃大亏。你见过哪个官见老百姓穷，发点款救济救济？哪个官让村里的穷孩子免费上学？他们就知道喝穷人的血！
    帝王将相都是地主，都是剥削阶级统治者。说到老根，从他们落生那天起就算沾着“福”了。他们就是什么“王爷”，什么“公爷”，什么“少爷”，他们的“福”就是喝我们的血！这些王爷崽子，长大了怎么能替穷人说话？清朝时候，我们这一带都是皇家的“旗地”，我们只有扛活的份儿。王爷腿子来收租，从高级的皇家王爷直到低级的狗腿子和小渣渣子地主，都是敲穷人的骨髓，吸穷人的血。举个俺们砍柴禾的例子吧，一个棒劳力起半夜到二十里外的山里砍一百斤柴，背回来就得一天，第二天背到昌平去卖，那些收柴的“官”，狠命压价还不算，还要在秤杆子上扒你一层皮。当时是十六两一斤，他们就用十八两一斤的秤收，结果干了两天，买不了一升棒子！上到皇帝，下至小官渣渣子，哪一个不勒索压榨我们？我们穷就穷在这儿。
    在旧社会，我们压根儿没碰上过“好官”，也不相信那套鬼话。那些地主官僚弄得我家逃荒要饭，我两个弟弟送给了人，妹妹当了童养媳。要有“好官”，为什么还那么穷？现在生活好了，是因为共产党、毛主席领导我们把大大小小的地主官都打倒了。
    吴晗为资产阶级说话，仇视我们共产党，仇视我们贫下中农。他说海瑞骂皇帝。海瑞是谁呢？海瑞就是他。如果我们都信任他，跟着他走，我们会走到什么地步去？只会走上资本主义复辟道路。这是要我们走回头路，还让我们当牛当马呀！吴晗虽说有点文化，会写文章，但他的心多毒啊！
    吴晗这些人说旧社会有“好官”、“好皇帝”，海瑞是“清官”，都是胡说。他们谈论这些，要看他们的根底是什么，站在那一边。他们这些人都是金里生银里长的，过去是衣来伸手，饭来张口。他们跟我们被党救出来的人的感情就是不一样。他们是资产阶级的人，替地主、资产阶级说话，同我们两条心。他们想让我们再去当牛当马，办不到！
