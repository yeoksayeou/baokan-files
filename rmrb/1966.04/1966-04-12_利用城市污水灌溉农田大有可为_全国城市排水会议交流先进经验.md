    Utilizing Urban Sewage for Irrigation of Farmland Has Great Potential
    National Urban Drainage Conference Exchanges Advanced Experiences
    (Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 11) The National Urban Drainage Conference recently held in Tianjin by the Ministry of Building Engineering believes that utilizing urban sewage to irrigate farmland is a matter of promoting benefits and eliminating harm, and has great potential. Currently, forty-three cities across the country are using urban sewage to irrigate farmland, playing a positive role in promoting agricultural production increases.
    The industrial wastewater and domestic sewage discharged from cities contain organic fertilizers such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, and have relatively high fertilizer effectiveness. The sewage discharged daily from Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, contains a total fertilizer equivalent to forty-five tons of ammonium sulfate. Currently, all of the city's sewage is used for farmland irrigation.
    According to surveys, the yield of grain and vegetable crops in farmland irrigated with sewage generally increases by more than 15%. More than 100,000 mu of rice paddies around Shenyang and Fushun cities have seen significant increases in rice production after being irrigated with sewage, which has a higher fertilizer effect. Xi'an City diverts the sewage discharged daily to irrigate 65,000 mu of farmland in 135 production brigades, generally increasing wheat and corn production by more than 20% and cotton production by about 4%.
    The experience of some cities that have done a better job of using sewage to support agriculture proves that it is necessary to give prominence to politics, establish the idea of wholeheartedly serving industrial and agricultural production and the people's lives, and comprehensively implement the principle of "combining urban and rural areas, combining industry and agriculture, benefiting production, and facilitating life" in order to achieve comprehensive utilization of sewage, promoting benefits and eliminating harm, and making the best use of everything. The sewage discharged annually by Fushun City contains nitrogen equivalent to approximately 43,000 tons of ammonium sulfate. For a long time, these fertilizers have been wasted along with the sewage, and the water source for downstream Shenyang's water supply along the river has also been polluted. Last year, the national authorities, urban factories and enterprises, and rural people's commune production brigades adopted a "three-way combination" method to construct a sewage irrigation canal project leading to Shenyang, which achieved four major results: improving urban environmental sanitation and solving the problem of urban residents' domestic water use; using sewage as fertilizer for farmland irrigation, equivalent to applying 50 to 80 jin of fertilizer per mu; reducing production team costs, approximately 15% to 30% lower than well water irrigation costs; and cultivating farmland fertility, which is more conducive to substantial increases in production.
    The practice of some cities has proved that solving the problem of urban sewage supporting agriculture must break down foreign frameworks. In the past, the drainage designers of the Shijiazhuang City Urban Construction Bureau only followed some "foreign frameworks" and textbook regulations, rarely considered the specific conditions of the city, and rarely considered the needs of industrial and agricultural production. The sewage discharged by the Shijiazhuang Printing and Dyeing Factory contained strong alkali, so the Urban Construction Bureau stipulated that a separate drainage channel must be built to discharge it into the Hutuo River, resulting in an engineering cost of nearly one million yuan. When some production team members drew sewage for use, they interfered, and the team members were very dissatisfied. Later, they made a review: "We only make drainage plans according to foreign frameworks, and do not consider facilitating industrial production or facilitating agricultural irrigation. This means that we only have technology in our minds, and no politics." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, they abandoned foreign frameworks, walked out of the office, went deep into factories and rural areas, carried out scientific experiments, and found good ways to solve the problem of irrigating farmland with harmful and toxic industrial wastewater. They mixed the strongly alkaline industrial wastewater from the printing and dyeing factory with clear water and sewage with different component ratios, and conducted production experiments on eight crops, including corn, millet, cotton, and scallions. As a result, they explored the laws of using strongly alkaline wastewater to irrigate farmland, turning harmful water into beneficial water. The sewage from the Shijiazhuang Coking Plant contains acid. It is harmful in itself, but it also has the effect of killing bacteria and insects. Later, relevant departments mixed this sewage with wastewater from slaughterhouses to irrigate farmland, which eliminated the bacteria in the slaughterhouse wastewater and diluted the phenol toxicity of the coking plant sewage.
    The conference pointed out that there is still great potential in the utilization of sewage and industrial wastewater for irrigating farmland in cities across the country. The practice of some cities has proved that only by fully mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses can this potential be tapped quickly, well, and economically. Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province, mobilized the forces of factories, streets, and suburban production teams to build, maintain, and manage drainage pipelines and sewage pumping stations, reducing the difficulties of insufficient national investment and maintenance management forces. Currently, of the city's more than 53 kilometers of drainage pipelines, only 23 kilometers are managed by the Urban Construction Bureau, and only 13 professional maintenance workers are needed. Over the past few years, Shijiazhuang City has mobilized the beneficiary production team members to dig 110 kilometers of sewage irrigation canals, making the sewage irrigation area expand year by year. In the past year alone, it has expanded by more than 10,000 mu.

    利用城市污水灌溉农田大有可为
    全国城市排水会议交流先进经验
    新华社天津十一日电　建筑工程部最近在天津召开的全国城市排水会议认为，利用城市污水灌溉农田是一项兴利除害、大有可为的事情。现在，全国有四十三个城市利用城市污水浇灌农田，对促进农业增产方面起到了良好的作用。
    城市排出的工业废水和生活污水，含有氮、磷、钾等有机肥料，肥效比较高。河北省石家庄市每天排出的污水，总含肥量相当于四十五吨硫酸铵。目前，这个市的污水已全部用于农田灌溉。
    据调查，用污水灌溉的农田，粮食和蔬菜作物的产量一般都增长百分之十五以上。沈阳和抚顺市周围十万多亩稻田，用肥效更高的污水灌溉以后，水稻增产幅度很大。西安市把每天排出的污水引灌到周围一百三十五个生产大队的六万五千亩农田里，一般都使小麦和玉米增产两成以上，棉花增产百分之四左右。
    利用污水支援农业做得比较好的一些城市的经验证明，必须突出政治，树立全心全意为工农业生产服务，为人民生活服务的思想，全面贯彻“城乡结合，工农结合，有利生产，方便生活”的方针，才能做到污水综合利用，兴利除害，物尽其用。抚顺市每年排放掉的污水中，含氮量约合四万三千吨硫酸铵，长期以来，这些肥料都随同污水一起白白流失，而且下游沈阳沿河供水的水源也被污染。去年，由国家主管部门、城市的工厂企业和农村人民公社的生产大队采用“三结合”的办法，修建成了一条通往沈阳的污水灌渠工程，收到了四大效果：改善了城市环境卫生，解决了城市居民生活用水问题；污水顶肥用，用污水灌溉农田，相当于每亩地施用了五十斤到八十斤的肥料；生产队的成本降低，大约比井水灌溉的费用降低了百分之十五到三十；培养了农田地力，更有利于大幅度增产。
    有些城市的实践证明，解决城市污水支援农业的问题，必须破除洋框框。过去，石家庄市城市建设局排水设计人员只是按照一些“洋框框”和书本上的条文规定办事，很少考虑本市的具体情况，也很少考虑工农业生产的需要。石家庄印染厂排出的污水中含有强碱，城市建设局就规定必须单独建一条排水渠道，排入滹沱河，结果花费了将近一百万元的工程费用。有的生产队社员抽用污水，他们加以干涉，社员对此很不满意。后来，他们作了检查：“我们只按洋框框作排水规划，不考虑便利工业生产，便利农业灌溉，这就是我们脑子里只有技术，没有政治。”他们按照毛主席的教导，丢掉洋框框，走出办公室，深入工厂农村，大搞科学实验，找出了解决有害有毒的工业废水灌溉农田的好办法。他们把印染厂强碱性工业废水，用清水和各种成分比例不同的污水相混合，对玉米、谷子、棉花、大葱等八种农作物进行了生产实验，结果摸索出了利用强碱废水灌溉农田的规律，把害水变成了利水。石家庄焦化厂的污水中含有酸。它本身有害，但也有杀菌虫的作用。后来有关部门把这种污水同屠宰厂的废水混合灌溉农田以后，既消灭了屠宰厂废水中的细菌，也稀释了焦化厂污水的酚毒。
    这次会议指出，在利用污水和工业废水灌溉农田方面，全国各城市还有很大的潜力。一些城市的实践证明，只有充分发动群众，依靠群众，才能多快好省地把这些潜力挖掘出来。湖南省株洲市发动工厂、街道和郊区生产队各方面的力量，修建和养护管理排水管道和污水抽升泵站，减少了国家投资和维护管理力量不足的困难。现在，全市五十三公里多的排水管道，只有二十三公里是由城市建设局管理的，专业的养护维修工人只用十三人就够了。石家庄市几年来发动受益的生产队社员挖污水灌溉渠道一百一十公里，使得污水灌区面积逐年扩大，只去年一年就扩大了一万多亩。
