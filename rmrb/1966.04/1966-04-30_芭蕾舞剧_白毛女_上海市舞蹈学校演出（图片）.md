    Ballet
    The White Haired Girl
    Performed by Shanghai Dance School
              Overture
    Before liberation, Chinese peasants suffered cruel oppression and exploitation by landlords, bureaucratic capitalists, and imperialists, enduring countless hardships. However, they did not yield. Facing the enemy's knives, they stood tall and waged heroic and tenacious resistance and struggle. Listen to their songs: Looking at the world, for thousands of years, the poor people have been exploited and whipped. How many farmhands were enslaved, how many Xi'ers were persecuted. Endless tears turn into torrential rain! Unspeakable hatred turns into waves of rivers and seas!

                 Scene One
    A New Year's Eve during the Anti-Japanese War, Yanggezhuang, Hebei.
    Xi'er is happily preparing for the New Year. The poor peasant Yang Bailao has just returned from dodging debts. The traitorous bully landlord Huang Shiren, leading his henchman Mu Renzhi, breaks into Yang Bailao's house. Under the guise of debt collection, they want to forcibly seize Xi'er. Yang Bailao resolutely resists and is beaten to death.
    Wang Dachun and the villagers rush over. Huang Shiren threatens the masses with a gun and forcibly takes Xi'er away.
    Wang Dachun and others want to fight the enemy, but underground party member Uncle Zhao dissuades them, guiding them to join the Eighth Route Army and make revolution. Xinhua News Agency Reporter Cui Baolin Photo
                  Scene Two

                  Scene Three
    Xi'er avoids the pursuit of landlord henchman Mu Renzhi and others, hiding in the reeds. Mu and others find Xi'er's lost shoe by the river and mistakenly believe she has drowned.
    Xi'er's deep class hatred is like water that cannot be scooped dry, fire that cannot be extinguished. She sings passionately: "I will not die, I want to live, I want revenge."
              Scene Four
    Xi'er fights against the wind, snow, and wild beasts in the barren mountains. After many springs, summers, autumns, and winters, her black hair has turned white, but Xi'er's character has become even braver and more tenacious. She waits for the opportunity to take revenge. She hopes for the sun to rise in the east, hoping for the liberation of the peasants.

    The Eighth Route Army liberates Yanggezhuang. The villagers warmly welcome and comfort them. Wang Dachun and a detachment of the Eighth Route Army stay in Yanggezhuang to mobilize the masses and carry out work.
    Aunt Zhang tells of Xi'er's experience, arousing everyone's memories and anger.
    Uncle Zhao and Wang Dachun call on the army and the people to unite and wage a struggle against the traitorous bully landlord Huang Shiren.
    A servant girl from the Huang family comes to report that Huang Shiren and Mu Renzhi are trying to escape.
    Uncle Zhao and Wang Dachun immediately lead the masses to track them down.

    Huang Shiren and Mu Renzhi encounter rain on their escape and hide in the Grandma Temple. The "White Haired Girl" (Xi'er) sees her irreconcilable class enemies. Filled with hatred, she chases and beats Huang Shiren and Mu Renzhi.
    Uncle Zhao, Wang Dachun, and others chase Huang Shiren to the Grandma Temple, finding Huang Shiren's umbrella. The crowd follows in pursuit. Dachun stays behind to search and discovers the "White Haired Girl" and follows her.

                Scene Seven
    The "White Haired Girl" (Xi'er) returns to her cave. Wang Dachun arrives and they recognize each other. Years of suffering, years of hatred, all rush to her heart.
    Filled with joy and gratitude, they sing: "The sun has risen, the sun is Mao Zedong, the sun is the Communist Party." Wang Dachun leads Xi'er and the villagers out of the cave, facing the sun.

    The old society turned people into ghosts, the new society turned ghosts into people. Xi'er returns to her liberated hometown and sees her relatives.
    Thousands of years of hatred must be avenged, ten thousand years of grievances must be redressed. Xi'er angrily denounces Huang Shiren's crimes to the villagers.
    The masses rise up and denounce and severely punish the traitorous bully landlord Huang Shiren.
    The liberated peasants sing: Millions of workers and peasants rise up together, the smoke rolls in, how many Xi'ers have turned themselves over, the beautiful rivers and mountains will always shine!

    Dachun leads a detachment of the Eighth Route Army to the front line. The "White Haired Girl" (Xi'er) and the villagers join the ranks of the battle, determined to carry the revolution through to the end.

    在解放以前，我国农民遭受地主、官僚资产阶级和帝国主义的残酷压迫和剥削，经历了多少苦难。但是他们并没有屈服，面对敌人的屠刀，挺起胸膛，进行英勇顽强的反抗和斗争。听，他们的歌声：看人间，往事几千载，穷苦的人儿受剥削，挨鞭笞。多少长工被奴役，多少喜儿遭迫害。流不完的眼泪啊，化作倾盆大雨降下来！诉不尽的仇恨啊，汇成波浪滔天的江和海！
