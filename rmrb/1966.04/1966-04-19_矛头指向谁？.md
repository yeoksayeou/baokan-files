    Who is the Spearhead Aimed At?
    Xu Jianchun
    In 1958, under the leadership of the Party, the Chinese people held high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and advanced bravely and vigorously on the socialist road. The development of socialist revolution and construction aroused the hatred of class enemies. They vainly attempted to overturn the three red banners and had been waiting for an opportunity to launch an attack on the revolution. By 1959, when China suffered serious natural disasters and socialist economic construction encountered temporary difficulties, imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries united to conduct an anti-China chorus. Domestic capitalist forces and feudal forces also became active, and right opportunist elements representing their interests seized the opportunity to come out, gloatingly launching a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism, attacking the three red banners. At this time, Comrade Wu Han wrote "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor." When right opportunist elements clamored to destroy the People's Communes, saying that the public accumulation of the People's Communes was too much, making the people poor, Wu Han also said in "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor": "Making the common people so poor that they have nothing left," and asked the emperor to care about the suffering of the people. Here we can see how similar Comrade Wu Han's remarks are to those of the class enemies! In his article "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor," Comrade Wu Han said that things that originally could not be scolded, "If someone really scolds, it is also a pleasure." In an article of more than a thousand words, he loudly shouted "scold," and the word "scold" appeared as many as nineteen times. In essence, this is using the mouth of the dead to scold the Party and socialism, cheering and applauding the right opportunist elements in carrying out anti-Party and anti-socialist activities.
    Comrade Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is also a big poisonous weed against the Party and socialism. During the period when China's socialist construction encountered temporary difficulties, class enemies vigorously engaged in activities. At that time, a black wind of "going it alone" swept across society, saying that "contracting production to households" and "going it alone" could mobilize people's enthusiasm, etc. A rich peasant element from Hou Lü Brigade of our Xiyou Commune said: "The commune was established too early. It has only been two years since the establishment of the advanced cooperative, and who knows what kind of cooperative will be established in another two years." Some landlords and rich peasants were active everywhere, inciting some backward-thinking and labor-rich members of the commune to come out and demand "contracting work to households." These landlords and rich peasants promoted that to improve the enthusiasm for production, it is necessary to implement "contracting work to households," so that everyone can work with energy, and after completing the collective work, they can go to manage their private plots and also do business to earn money. They also said, "It would be better to implement 'contracting production to households.'" As soon as the poor and lower-middle peasants of our brigade discovered this phenomenon, they immediately stood up to struggle. They said: "This is not okay! Isn't this the same as going it alone? We have been taking the road of collectivization under the leadership of the Party for more than ten years, and this is asking us to go backwards, we will never agree." The poor and lower-middle peasants criticized these destructive remarks and withstood the evil wind. However, Comrade Wu Han also said in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," "With land, why worry about food and clothing, good times are just around the corner," vigorously promoting the "benefits" of "returning land." How are these words of Wu Han exactly the same as those of the class enemies?
    When the right opportunist elements were resolutely struggled against by the Party and the people, and some were "dismissed" from their positions, and the class enemies' attack was hit, Comrade Wu Han again praised the "clean officials" who engaged in "returning land" in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," saying that Hai Rui was the "savior" of the people. This is to praise those right opportunist elements who oppose the People's Commune and want us to go backwards, saying that they represent the interests of the peasants and are "supported" by the peasants. This is an extreme slander against our poor and lower-middle peasants, and we resolutely do not agree. "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" also strives to promote Hai Rui's spirit of not surrendering, saying, "I, Hai Rui, am broad-minded when I lose my official hat, and one day when I return to office, I will reorganize the discipline." He is telling the right opportunist elements not to be discouraged, and to try again after failing. Look, from what position is Comrade Wu Han speaking?
    We are proletarian revolutionaries. We want to learn from Lei Feng and Wang Jie, but Comrade Wu Han wants us to learn from Hai Rui, whom he shaped. What class says what. We want to oppose class enemies, oppose right opportunist elements, firmly listen to the Party, and defend socialism. However, Comrade Wu Han vigorously promoted Hai Rui, advocating Hai Rui's spirit of "daring to scold the emperor" and his spirit of "uprightness and integrity." His intentions are truly malicious.
    Comrade Wu Han, wearing the cloak of academic research, thinks that we cannot see his anti-Party and anti-socialist essence. In fact, he is completely wrong. We have Mao Zedong Thought, this great ideological weapon. As long as we use this political telescope and microscope to take a look, from what position Comrade Wu Han is standing, for whom he is speaking, and who his spearhead is pointing at? Isn't all this very clear? We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and thoroughly expose and criticize Comrade Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-socialist position and ideology.

    矛头指向谁？
    徐建春
    一九五八年，我国人民在党的领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，意气风发，斗志昂扬地在社会主义大道上奋勇前进。社会主义革命和建设的发展，引起了阶级敌人的憎恨。他们妄想反掉三面红旗，一直在等候机会，向革命发动进攻。到了一九五九年，当我国遭受了严重自然灾害，社会主义经济建设遭到暂时的困难的时候，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派联合起来，进行反华大合唱。国内资本主义势力、封建势力也活跃起来了，代表他们利益的右倾机会主义分子趁机出笼，幸灾乐祸地向党向社会主义发动猖狂进攻，攻击三面红旗。正当这个时候，吴晗同志写了《海瑞骂皇帝》。右倾机会主义分子为了破坏人民公社，叫嚣人民公社的公共积累搞多了，把人民都搞穷了的时候，而吴晗在《海瑞骂皇帝》中也说：“弄得老百姓都穷的光光的”，要皇帝关心人民的疾苦。在这里可以看到，吴晗同志的言论和阶级敌人讲的话又多么相似！吴晗同志在《海瑞骂皇帝》一文中，说什么原来不能骂的，“真有人骂了，却也痛快”。千多字的文章，大肆叫喊着“骂”，“骂”字就有十九处之多。这在实质上是借死人的嘴，来骂党骂社会主义，为右倾机会主义分子进行反党反社会主义活动打气和叫好。
    吴晗同志的《海瑞罢官》，也是一株反党反社会主义的大毒草。在我国社会主义建设遭到暂时困难的时期，阶级敌人大肆活动起来。当时，社会上刮起了一股“单干”的黑风，说什么“包产到户”、“单干”可以调动人的积极性啦，等等。我们西由公社后吕大队有个富农分子就说：“公社办早了。高级社成立才二年，就办公社，再过二年不知办啥社”。一些地富分子到处活动，他们煽动一些思想落后、劳动力较多的社员，出来要求“包工到户”。这些地富分子宣传说什么要提高生产积极性，必须实行“包工到户”，那样大家干起来才有劲，集体活干完后可以去搞自留地，还可以去做买卖赚钱。他们还说，“实行‘包产到户’更好”。我们大队的贫下中农一发现这现象，立即起来斗争。他们说：“这还行！这不是和单干一样吗？我们在党的领导下走集体化道路已经十几年了，这是要我们走回头路，我们决不答应”。贫下中农对这些破坏性言论进行了批判，顶住了歪风。而吴晗同志也在《海瑞罢官》中，说什么“有土地何愁衣饭，好光景就在眼前”，大力宣扬“退田”的“好处”。吴晗讲的这些话，怎么和阶级敌人的话一模一样呢？
    当右倾机会主义分子遭到党和人民的坚决斗争，有的“罢”了官，阶级敌人的进攻遭到打击的时候，吴晗同志又在《海瑞罢官》中，歌颂搞“退田”的“清官”，说海瑞是人民的“救星”，这就是歌颂那些反对人民公社、要我们走回头路的右倾机会主义分子，说他们是代表农民利益的，得到农民“拥护”的。这是对我们贫下中农极大的诬蔑，我们坚决不答应。《海瑞罢官》还着力宣扬海瑞的不屈服精神，说什么“我海瑞丢乌纱心胸开朗，有一日再居官重整纪纲”，要右倾机会主义分子，不要灰心，失败了再干。看看，吴晗同志是站在什么立场上讲话的？
    我们是无产阶级革命者。我们要学习雷锋、王杰，但是吴晗同志却要我们向他塑造的海瑞学习。什么阶级说什么话。我们要反对阶级敌人，反对右倾机会主义分子，坚决听党的话，保卫社会主义。可是，吴晗同志却大肆宣扬海瑞，鼓吹海瑞“敢骂皇帝”的精神、“刚直不阿”的精神，他的用心真太恶毒了。
    吴晗同志披着学术研究的外衣，自以为我们看不出他的反党反社会主义的本质了，其实，他完全错了。我们有毛泽东思想这一伟大的思想武器，只要用这个政治望远镜和显微镜去一看，吴晗同志究竟站在什么立场上，替谁讲话，他的矛头又在指向谁？这不是都很清楚了吗？我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底揭露和批判吴晗同志反党反社会主义的立场和思想。
