    Editor's Note: The great debate in Guiyang City surrounding the "rice straw rope problem" criticized various non-political tendencies in past economic work, raised people's political consciousness, and boosted people's revolutionary drive. As a result, in a relatively short period, the face of local industry and handicraft production, which had been relatively backward for a long time, began to undergo significant changes.

    Rice straw rope, seemingly an insignificant small commodity, but why can't this small commodity be produced locally, and why must it rely on external supply? This question is very representative in Guiyang City, reflecting the serious struggle between capitalist and socialist management ideologies in economic work. This struggle exists not only in the production and operation of rice straw ropes but also in the production and operation of other commodities. Guiyang City seized this typical example, launched a great debate, and enabled various departments of industry and commerce to combine and examine their respective "rice straw rope problems," understood the great significance of emphasizing politics, understood the principle that politics is the commander, transformed their thinking, and improved their work.

    In other regions and departments, there are their own "rice straw rope problems." Launching debates by seizing such problems can make the debate on the relationship between politics and professional work more vivid, concrete, and deeply rooted in people's hearts; it can also closely combine the debate with and promote the current increase production and practice economy movement, achieving the effect of grasping revolution and promoting production, grasping revolution and promoting construction.

    Under the leadership of the Guiyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the industrial and commercial enterprises and economic work leading departments of Guiyang City, Guizhou Province, recently conducted a lively and enthusiastic great debate emphasizing politics. This debate revolved around the question of whether or not to import a small commodity—rice straw rope—from other places. The vast numbers of cadres and workers armed their minds with Mao Zedong Thought in the great debate, criticized the tendency of not emphasizing politics in economic work, and powerfully promoted the development of local industrial and handicraft production.

    Guiyang is a city with a relatively weak industrial production base. Before liberation, there was no modern industry, and even very common daily necessities such as ink, hairpins, and buttons could not be produced. After liberation, Guiyang's industry has developed considerably, but compared with advanced regions, there is still a large gap, especially the development of small commodity production in local industry and handicrafts is relatively slow, failing to meet market needs.

    The rice straw rope problem is a very representative problem. Rice straw rope is a packaging material used by industrial departments to bundle products and equipment, and it is originally very easy to process. However, in recent years, Guiyang has been importing it from Changsha and Yiyang in Hunan Province, consuming a large amount of transportation capacity every year. In the period from March 1964 to September 1965 alone, more than 250,000 jin were imported. Is it that Guiyang City has no conditions to produce rice straw rope? No, the suburban areas of Guiyang City are rich in rice straw resources, with more than 20 million jin of rice straw that can be used to make straw products every year. If calculated according to the Guiyang commercial department's plan to operate 540,000 jin of rice straw rope in 1966, it would only require 675,000 jin of rice straw, which is less than 3 percent of the rice straw production. At the same time, some handicraft production cooperatives in Guiyang City and production teams in the suburbs originally had the tradition and habit of processing rice straw rope. The problem is that in recent years, other places have switched to machine processing, which has high work efficiency, good quality, and low cost; while local production has remained at the level of manual production, with low work efficiency, poor quality, and high cost. This has gradually eliminated the production of rice straw rope in Guiyang, turning to complete reliance on external supply. There are many problems like the "rice straw rope" in Guiyang, such as pots, bowls, spoons, chopsticks, straw paper, straw bags, dustpans, etc., most of which are sold as products from other places. Some transport Guizhou's raw materials to other places for processing, and then transport them back from thousands of miles away.

    The Guiyang Municipal Party Committee gained an insight from the rice straw rope problem. They believe that the rice straw rope problem seems to be a trivial matter, but it is very representative in Guiyang City. Therefore, they decided to seize this problem to launch a debate. The Municipal Party Committee pointed out to various departments that in this "small matter" of rice straw rope, it reflects that some people, especially leading cadres, have wrong attitudes in dealing with backwardness and difficulties. Instead of advancing in the face of difficulties, they retreat in the face of difficulties and do nothing. This will make the road narrower and narrower, and production will always lag behind.

    The cadres and workers in the industrial departments focused on discussing the question of "Production for Whom?" Some comrades in the leading departments examined their past erroneous ideas of greed for big and foreign things, and unwillingness to engage in small and local products. They said: "In the past, we only looked at small, local, and indigenous (local industrial products), and wholeheartedly pursued high, large, and foreign." They often complacently showed off a few new "foreign" products while ignoring the large number of small and local products needed for agricultural production and people's lives, failing to include small products such as rice straw rope in the economic plan and not actively supporting them, allowing them to be eliminated. Some people also lacked the ambition to strive for the upstream, believing that the backward state of production left over from history in Guiyang was unchangeable, and no matter how hard they tried, they could not catch up with brother regions. "If the market needs goods that cannot be packaged, manage as much as you can." Therefore, they did not seriously take measures to solve some problems such as rice straw rope that could be easily solved. Some comrades in production units examined their past business ideas with "profit" as the head. They said that in the past, they often did not emphasize politics but emphasized profit. They produced whatever products had high profits. Small products such as rice straw rope were "not very profitable and troublesome." Therefore, they were unwilling to produce them.

    In the commercial departments, the focus was on discussing "Why do business? Is it to make money and make a living, or to do business for socialist construction and for the revolution?" Some comrades said that in the past, they "looked outward with both eyes and stretched their hands outward," thinking that "wherever the quality is good, buy there, and whoever is cheaper and can make more money, buy from them." As for whether local production can go up or not, it is none of their business. After the debate, they realized that this was losing the "three major viewpoints" of socialist commerce. They said that our production and business are all about doing revolution. We must resolutely act in accordance with the state plan and the needs of the people, and overcome the simple profit viewpoint. Only in this way will we not lose our way, and will we consciously and in every possible way take measures to prevent problems such as having to import rice straw rope from other places from occurring, and promote industrial and agricultural production. During the debate, the Guiyang Municipal Native Produce Management Department, which operated rice straw rope, also organized employees to investigate the production and sales of rice straw rope in rural areas. They saw that a few production teams had increased their collective income and members' income and promoted agricultural production because they had developed rice straw rope sideline production. Some production teams suffered some losses because they could not find a market for rice straw. These facts made them deeply realize that a socialist commercial enterprise must resolutely follow the "develop the economy, ensure supply" policy formulated by Chairman Mao, serve proletarian politics, and serve the vast majority of the people.

    After this great debate, the vast numbers of workers and cadres in the industrial and commercial enterprises and management departments of Guiyang City received a vivid education in emphasizing politics. They said that the rice straw rope problem gave us a mirror, making us see how dangerous a tendency it is to not emphasize politics in economic work, and how much harm it can bring to national construction. After improving ideological understanding, changing the backward situation, developing industrial production, and catching up with advanced regions became the urgent demands of the broad masses.

    Now, the industrial and commercial departments of Guiyang City have taken active action. According to statistics from the commercial departments, the number of local products purchased in the first quarter of this year reached 136, an increase of 116 over the same period last year. The product varieties arranged by the planning department this year have also increased significantly. The rice straw rope problem has been completely solved. Relevant production units have manufactured some of their own machinery and equipment, and have purchased ten grass bag machines and five grass rope machines from other places, learned advanced operating techniques, and established five production bases. Now grass ropes and grass bags are no longer imported from other places, achieving self-sufficiency, and the quality is gradually improving and the cost is greatly reduced.

    After this debate, people also drew inferences from one instance and used one to bring about ten, so that many problems similar to rice straw rope were readily solved. For example, the Guiyang Glass Factory needed bamboo shells for the production of thermos bottles. In the past, they always purchased them from Changsha, Hunan, and other places far away, while Guizhou and nearby areas have abundant bamboo resources, but bamboo shell production has not been developed. This time, the relevant departments investigated near Guiyang for more than a month, ran 22 units in two counties, and found a handicraft cooperative in a bamboo-rich area, signed a production contract, and ended the unreasonable situation of transporting thermos bottle bamboo shells from far away.

    This debate has also enhanced people's spirit of collaboration. The communist spirit of cooperation between industry and industry, industry and commerce in the Guiyang area is being greatly promoted.

    一堂生动的突出政治的教育课
    贵阳市抓住“稻草绳问题”开展一场政治和业务关系的辩论，批判了种种非政治倾向，促进了工商企业部门的工作
    编者按：贵阳市围绕着“稻草绳问题”展开的一场大辩论，批判了过去经济工作中的种种非政治倾向，提高了人们的政治觉悟，鼓起了人们的革命干劲，结果，在比较短的时间里，就使得长时期以来比较落后的地方工业和手工业生产的面貌，开始起了明显的变化。
    稻草绳，看来是一件无足轻重的小商品，可是，这种小商品为什么本地不能生产，非要依赖外地供应不可呢？这个问题，在贵阳市很有代表性，它反映了经济工作中资本主义和社会主义两种经营思想的严重斗争。这个斗争，不但在稻草绳的生产和经营问题上存在，在其它一些商品的生产和经营上也同样存在。贵阳市抓住了这个典型，开展了大辩论，使工商企业各部门都结合检查了各自的“稻草绳问题”，懂得了突出政治的重大意义，懂得了政治是统帅的道理，改造了自己的思想，改进了自己的工作。
    在其它各个地区、各个部门，都有自己的“稻草绳问题”。抓住这样的问题来开展辩论，既可以使政治与业务关系的辩论更加生动具体，更加深入人心；又能使辩论密切结合和推动当前的增产节约运动，收到抓革命促生产，抓革命促建设的效果。
    贵州省贵阳市的工商企业和经济工作领导部门，不久前在中共贵阳市委的领导下，进行了一场生动热烈的突出政治的大辩论。这次辩论是围绕着一项小商品——稻草绳应不应该从外地调进的问题而展开的。广大干部和职工在大辩论中用毛泽东思想武装了头脑，批判了在经济工作中不突出政治的倾向，对当地工业和手工业生产的发展起了有力的促进作用。
    贵阳是一个工业生产基础比较薄弱的城市，解放前没有现代化工业，连墨水、发卡、纽扣等极普通的日用小商品都不能生产。解放后，贵阳的工业有了相当大的发展，但与先进地区比较，还有很大差距，尤其是地方工业、手工业的小商品生产发展比较慢，满足不了市场的需要。
    稻草绳问题是一个很有代表性的问题。稻草绳是工业部门用来包扎产品、设备的包装材料，它本来是很容易加工的。但是贵阳地区近几年来却一直从湖南的长沙、益阳等地调进，每年耗用了大量的运输力，仅从一九六四年三月到一九六五年九月的一段时间里，就调进了二十五万多斤。是不是贵阳市没有条件生产稻草绳呢？不是，贵阳市郊稻草资源丰富，每年可以用来作草制品的稻草在两千万斤以上，如果按贵阳商业部门一九六六年经营稻草绳五十四万斤的计划计算，只需要稻草六十七万五千斤，还不到稻草产量的百分之三。同时，贵阳市里的一些手工业生产合作社和郊区生产队，原来也有加工稻草绳的传统和习惯。问题只是：近几年来外地改用了机器加工，工效高，质量好，成本低；而本地的生产却一直停留在手工生产的水平上，工效低，质量差，成本高，这样就使贵阳加工稻草绳的生产逐渐被淘汰了，转而完全依赖外地供应。类似“稻草绳”这样的问题，在贵阳还有许多，象锅、碗、勺、筷、草纸、草袋、撮箕等，多数卖的是外地产品。有的把贵州的原料运到外地加工，然后又不远千里返运回来。
    贵阳市委从稻草绳问题得到了一个启示。他们认为，稻草绳问题看起来好象是一件小事，可是在贵阳市很有代表性，因此决定抓住这个问题来展开辩论。市委向各部门指出，在稻草绳这件“小事”上，反映了一部分人，特别是领导干部在对待落后和困难的问题上，存在着错误态度，他们不是遇难而进，而是遇难而退，无所作为，这样就会路子越走越窄，生产就会永远落后。
    工业部门的干部和职工，着重讨论了“为谁生产？”的问题。领导部门的一些同志检查了过去贪大求洋，不愿搞小产品、土产品的错误思想，他们说：“过去我们是两眼不看小、土、地（地方工业产品），一心追求高、大、洋”，常沾沾自喜于几件“洋”的新产品，而忽视了农业生产和人民生活大量需要的小产品、土产品，没有把稻草绳等小产品纳入经济计划，不积极扶持，任其被淘汰。还有一部分人是缺乏力争上游的雄心壮志，认为贵阳在历史上遗留下来的生产落后状况是不可改变的，怎么赶也赶不过兄弟地区，“市场需要的商品包不起来，能管多少就算多少”因而对一些即使轻而易举就能解决的稻草绳之类的问题，也不认真采取措施去解决。一些生产单位的同志，检查了过去“利”字当头的经营思想，他们说，过去常常不是突出政治，而是突出利润，什么产品利润大就生产什么产品，稻草绳等这类小产品，“油水不大，费事不小”，因此不乐意生产。
    在商业部门，着重讨论了“为什么做生意？是为赚钱、吃饭做生意，还是为社会主义建设、为革命做生意？”有的同志说，过去，他们是“两眼向外看，两手朝外伸”，认为“哪里质量好到哪里采购，谁家便宜能多赚钱就买谁的”，至于本地生产上去上不去，那不关自己的事。经过辩论以后，他们认识到这是丢掉了社会主义商业的“三大观点”。他们说，我们搞生产、做生意，都是干革命。一定要坚决按国家计划办事，按人民需要办事，克服单纯利润观点。只有这样，我们才不会迷失方向，才会自觉地、千方百计地从各方面采取措施，防止连稻草绳还要从外地调进这样的问题发生，促进工农业生产。经营稻草绳的贵阳市土产经理部，在辩论过程中，还组织职工到农村调查了稻草绳的产销情况，他们看到有少数生产队因为开展了稻草绳的副业生产，增加了集体收入和社员的收入，促进了农业生产。有些生产队由于稻草找不到销路，受到了一些损失。这些事实使他们深刻认识到，一个社会主义的商业企业，一定要坚决遵循毛主席制订的“发展经济，保障供给”的方针，为无产阶级政治服务，为绝大多数人民群众服务。
    经过了这场大辩论，使贵阳市工商企业和管理部门的广大职工和干部受到了一次突出政治的生动教育，他们说，稻草绳问题给我们照了一次镜子，使我们看到在经济工作中不突出政治是一种多么危险的倾向，它给国家建设会带来多么大的危害。思想认识提高以后，改变落后状况，发展工业生产，赶上先进地区，成了广大群众的迫切要求。
    现在，贵阳市的工商业部门已积极行动起来，据商业部门统计，今年一季度收购的地方产品达一百三十六种，比去年同期增加了一百十六种。计划部门今年安排的产品品种也有较大幅度增长。稻草绳问题已完全解决，有关生产单位自己动手制造了一部分机具设备，又从外地购进了十台草袋机和五台草绳机，学来了先进的操作技术，建立了五个生产基地。现在草绳、草袋已经不再从外地调进，实现了自给自足，而且质量逐步提高，成本大幅度下降。
    经过这场辩论以后，人们还举一反三、以一带十，使许多类似稻草绳的问题迎刃而解。例如，贵阳玻璃厂生产热水瓶需要的竹壳，过去历来到湖南长沙等地远道采购，而贵州附近地区竹子资源很丰富，却没有发展竹壳生产。这次，有关部门到贵阳附近调查了一个多月，跑了两个县的二十二个单位，在一个盛产竹子的地区找到了一个手工业合作社，签订了生产合同，从此结束了远道运进热水瓶竹壳的不合理情况。
    这场辩论还增强了人们的协作精神。贵阳地区工业和工业之间、工业和商业之间，共产主义协作精神正在大大发扬起来。
