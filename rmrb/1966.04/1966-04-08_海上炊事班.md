    The Seafaring Cooks
    Naval Deputy Observation and Communications Chief Ren Haiying
    Never mind the raging winds,
    Never mind the towering waves!
    Come on, Little Gao,
    —Let’s cook!
    Squad leader Zhang Haishan,
    Strikes a match to light the stove;
    Suddenly a big wave rushes in,
    Ha, adding "oil" to the fire, let’s go!
    The squad leader stands tall,
    Little Gao wipes his "sweat,"
    Spoon and spatula in hand,
    Vowing to wrest lunch from the wind and waves!
    To fight wolves, you need a gun,
    To vanquish demons, you rely on a sharp sword,
    How can sailors fighting the "enemy"
    Go without food?!
    Quick! Fry the vegetables,
    Quick! Steam the rice,
    The two are like astride fierce steeds,
    "Scaling mountains and crossing ridges" without dismounting...
    "Wah!" Little Gao vomits,
    Another patch of yellow water,
    He squeezes his eyes and looks up,
    A bowl of water is offered to his lips...
    The squad leader asks him if it's hard,
    He pats his chest: I'm a Communist Youth League member!
    The squad leader firmly grasps Little Gao's hand,
    Two red hearts connected by a single line.
    Good news of target practice comes from the gun positions,
    The warship sings a hearty song as it surges forward,
    The galley resounds with "percussion music,"
    Wisps of smoke drift over the crests of the waves...

    海上炊事班
    海军副观通长　任海鹰
    管它狂风怒吼，
    管它浪大滔天！
    来，小高，
    ——做饭！
    班长张海山，
    划根火柴把灶火点；
    突然一个大浪扑进来，
    哈，火上加“油”，干！
    班长挺起胸，
    小高擦把“汗”，
    勺子、铲子掌在手，
    誓与风浪夺午餐！
    打狼要有枪，
    斩妖靠利剑，
    水兵与“敌”相争斗，
    哪能不吃饭？！
    快！炒熟菜，
    快！蒸上饭，
    两人象跨上烈马背，
    “翻山越岭”不下鞍……
    “哇！”小高吐了，
    又是黄水一片，
    他挤挤眼抬起头，
    唇边伸来水一碗……
    班长问他苦不苦，
    他胸脯一拍：我是共青团员！
    班长紧握小高的手，
    两颗红心一线牵。
    炮位传来打靶捷报，
    战舰高歌猛向前，
    伙房里奏着“敲打乐”，
    浪尖上飘着缕缕炊烟……
