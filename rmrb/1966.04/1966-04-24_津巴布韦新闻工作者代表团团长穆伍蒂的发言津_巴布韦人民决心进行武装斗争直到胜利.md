    Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd -- When speaking at the enlarged plenary meeting of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association on April 22nd, Don Muwuti, head of the Zimbabwe Journalists Delegation, emphasized that the people of Zimbabwe must wage a relentless armed struggle against imperialism until victory. We completely reject the path of appeasement, surrender, and compromise with imperialism.

    He said that the path of compromise and surrender is a dead end. We cannot believe in "half-freedom." We are fighting for the complete independence of our country and our economy.

    In his speech, Muwuti warmly praised the great significance of the Chinese revolution. He said that the People's Republic of China has always been the center of revolutionary theory and practice. It is a tremendous source of inspiration for us to carry out a relentless anti-imperialist struggle to restore our true national independence and sovereignty. Imperialism underestimated the invincible vitality and revolutionary spirit of the Chinese masses. The Chinese people have shown that an exploited people with nothing but the firm will to smash the chains of oppression can rise up to fight and finally completely eliminate the group of exploiters who were once militarily dominant. This is an excellent lesson for the people of Zimbabwe.

    He said that ever since the British imperialists imposed the fascist white minority on us, we have been an unarmed, oppressed, and exploited people. As a result of this brutal system, in a country that can support an estimated more than seven million people, four million Zimbabwean Africans have been living in abject poverty and starvation. The workers and peasants of Zimbabwe, under the leadership of their revolutionary vanguard, the Zimbabwe African National Union, are determined to completely eliminate the regime backed by the United Kingdom and the United States, which has caused this unfortunate state. This will not only liberate Zimbabwe from colonialism, but also lead it onto the socialist path of economic independence and justice. Unless the entire economy of this country belongs to the four million Zimbabweans, and not to a white or black exploiter minority, the Zimbabwe African National Union does not consider its mission of liberating Zimbabwe to be completed.

    Muwuti said that imperialism and colonialism are a dying horse, violently kicking and jumping around. Knowing that their end is near, these two monsters of imperialism and colonialism are making a dying struggle in many parts of the world. In Asia, the United States has nakedly revealed itself as a cruel imperialist and colonial country. Disregarding American and world opinion, the Johnson administration has adopted a cruel policy of genocide in Vietnam. It has been trying to cover up its crimes in that unfortunate country by hypocritically calling for unconditional negotiations, nominally seeking a solution, but actually wanting to whitewash its aggression in Vietnam internationally. We pay tribute to the heroic Vietnamese freedom fighters who have given the American imperialist aggressors a powerful blow.

    He said that we unreservedly condemn the puppet regime established by reactionaries supported by American imperialists in the unfortunate country of Indonesia for massacring and imprisoning thousands of Indonesian patriotic and progressive people and journalists. We fully support the struggle of the Indonesian people to liberate their homeland.

    He said that the various military dictatorships created by imperialism in Asia and Africa once again convincingly prove that talking about coexistence between imperialism and its victims means that the oppressed people of the world will be enslaved forever. We have no other choice but to fight imperialism to the end.

    Muwuti said that in many parts of Asia and Africa, imperialists still have full possession of newspapers and other means of propaganda. They are using these weapons extensively to demoralize the masses and influence the oppressed people, opposing the progressive movements that want to liberate the oppressed people. This is a challenge to the Asian-African Journalists Association. Imperialist propaganda must be effectively countered, and all obstacles set up by the enemy must be broken through to raise the revolutionary banner to every corner of Asia and Africa.

    津巴布韦新闻工作者代表团团长穆伍蒂的发言
    津巴布韦人民决心进行武装斗争直到胜利
    新华社二十三日讯　津巴布韦新闻工作者代表团团长唐·穆伍蒂二十二日在亚非新闻工作者协会书记处全体会议（扩大）上发言时强调指出，津巴布韦人民要对帝国主义进行无情的武装斗争，直到获胜为止。我们完全拒绝走姑息、投降和同帝国主义妥协的道路。
    他说，妥协投降的道路是一条死胡同。我们不能相信“半自由”。我们在为我们国家和我们经济的完全独立而斗争。
    穆伍蒂在发言中热烈赞扬了中国革命的伟大意义。他说，中华人民共和国一直是革命的理论和实践的中心。它是鼓舞我们为恢复我们的真正民族独立和主权而进行无情的反帝斗争的巨大源泉。帝国主义错误估计了中国群众的不可战胜的活力和革命精神。中国人民表明，一无所有而只有粉碎压迫锁链的这种坚定意志的一个被剥削的人民能够起来进行战斗，最后彻底消灭在军事上一度占优势的剥削者集团。这是对津巴布韦人民的一个极好的经验。
    他说，自从英帝国主义者把法西斯白人移民少数强加给我们之时起，我们一直是手无寸铁的、被压迫和被剥削的人民。由于这种残暴的制度的结果，在一个估计可以养活七百多万人的国家里，四百万津巴布韦的非洲人一直处于赤贫如洗和挨饿状态。津巴布韦的工人和农民在他们的革命的先锋队津巴布韦非洲民族联盟的领导下，决心把造成这种不幸状态的由英美作后盾的政权完全消灭，不仅把津巴布韦从殖民主义下解放出来，而且还使它走上经济独立和正义的社会主义道路。除非这个国家的整个经济都属于四百万津巴布韦人，而不属于白人或黑人剥削者少数，否则津巴布韦非洲民族联盟是不认为它的解放津巴布韦的任务已经完成。
    穆伍蒂说，帝国主义和殖民主义是一匹快死的马，它正在狂暴地乱踢乱跳。帝国主义和殖民主义这两个怪物知道死期接近了，正在世界许多地方进行垂死挣扎。在亚洲，美国赤裸裸地显露出它是一个残酷的帝国主义和殖民国家。约翰逊政府不顾美国和世界舆论，在越南采取残忍的种族灭绝的方针，它一直企图掩盖在那个不幸的国家的罪行，做法是，虚伪地要求举行无条件谈判，名义上是要谋求解决，但实际上是想在国际上粉饰它在越南的侵略。我们向英勇的越南自由战士致敬，他们已经给美帝国主义侵略者以有力的打击。
    他说，我们毫无保留地谴责得到美帝国主义分子支持的反动分子在印度尼西亚这个不幸的国家建立的傀儡政权屠杀和监禁数以千计的印度尼西亚爱国和进步的人民和新闻工作者。我们完全支持印度尼西亚人民为解放其祖国而进行的斗争。
    他说，帝国主义在亚洲和非洲制造的各种各样的军事独裁再一次令人信服地证明了在帝国主义和它的牺牲者之间谈共处是要世界上被压迫人民永远受奴役。我们没有别的选择，只能同帝国主义斗争到底。
    穆伍蒂说，在亚洲和非洲的许多地方，帝国主义者仍然充分拥有报纸和其他宣传手段。他们大肆运用这些武器使群众失去斗志并对被压迫的人民施加影响，反对要使被压迫人民得到解放的进步运动。这是对亚非新闻工作者协会的挑战。必须有效地对付帝国主义的宣传，必须突破敌人设置的一切障碍把革命旗帜举到亚非的各个角落。
