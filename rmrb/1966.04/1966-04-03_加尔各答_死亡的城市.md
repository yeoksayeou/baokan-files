　　“Calcutta - The City of Death”
　　Translator's Note: Calcutta is India's largest city, with a population of nearly six and a half million. It is India's center for industry, commerce, trade, and finance. Here, Indian comprador capitalists and business owners live lives of luxury and extravagance, while the working people struggle on the brink of death. The American magazine *Newsweek*, in its issue of April 4, published in advance, featured a report titled "Calcutta - The City of Death," describing the miserable conditions of Calcutta's poor. The following is an excerpted translation.
　　Approximately one million Indians sleep on the sidewalks of Calcutta every night. At dawn, tens of thousands of people draped in rags rise from the sidewalks they use as beds and go to the ditches to relieve themselves. The loincloths worn by the emaciated people barely cover their squatting knees.
　　Across the Hooghly River from Calcutta proper, behind the Calcutta railway terminus, lies Pilkhana, a typical slum area of Calcutta. More than 50,000 people live in a chaotic and overcrowded collection of small shacks. Stinking, clogged ditches run alongside the narrow streets that wind through this area. People wash clothes and relieve themselves in these ditches. But Pilkhana is by no means the worst slum in Calcutta. The residents of Pilkhana are, in fact, those who have had the good fortune to find work in nearby jute factories or railway workshops.
　　A severe food shortage has made matters worse. Although rationing has been implemented, giving everyone a little something to barely survive, the rate at which Calcutta's poor are dying from malnutrition exceeds that of recent years.
　　Week after week, more and more of Calcutta's poor fail in the final battle to sustain their families. If they fail, they move to the streets to live and sleep.
　　Recently, more than a thousand people a day have been receiving a spoonful of dal and rice (referring to cooked food boiled together – translator's note) from the Mullick Foundation (an Indian Hindu relief organization – translator's note). But this public food does not eliminate the common sight on the streets of Calcutta -- dying Indians lying unconscious on the streets. The only hope for these dying people to gain a little dignity is to be taken in by the hospital run by Mother Teresa. Unfortunately, Mother Teresa's hospital has only two large wards, and due to the extremely limited number of beds, a person who is admitted is sent back to where he was found if he has not died within a month, so that the bed can be given to someone else. Normally, this hospital admits 80 to 90 homeless people each month, and the monthly death rate is 30 to 40 people -- all due to malnutrition. But recently, the monthly admission rate has exceeded 120 people, and the number of deaths has also increased to 60 to 70 people.

### “加尔各答——死亡的城市”

专栏：外论摘要

    “加尔各答——死亡的城市”
    译者注：加尔各答是印度最大的城市，人口将近六百五十万。它是印度工商业、贸易、金融中心。在这里，印度买办资本家和企业主过着骄奢淫逸的生活，而劳动人民却在死亡线上挣扎。提前出版的四月四日一期的美国《新闻周刊》，以《加尔各答——死亡的城市》为题，报道了加尔各答贫民的惨状。以下为其摘译。
    大约有一百万名印度人每天晚上露宿在加尔各答的人行道上。天一亮，成千上万披着破烂的人就从他们用来作为床铺的人行道上起身，到沟渠那里去排泄。骨瘦如柴的人们身上披着的腰布，刚刚盖得住蹲着的膝头。
    与加尔各答本埠隔呼格利河相对，正处在加尔各答铁路总站后面的皮尔克哈纳，是加尔各答的一个典型的贫民窟区域。五万多人居住在杂乱无章、拥挤不堪的许多小茅屋里。蜿蜒在这个地区的狭窄街道的旁边的，是臭气熏天的、阻塞了的沟渠。人们在这些沟渠里洗涤衣服和排泄。不过皮尔克哈纳决不是加尔各答最恶劣的贫民区。皮尔克哈纳的居民，事实上是那些交上好运气在附近黄麻工厂或铁路车间找到工作做的人。
    严重的粮荒使事情更加恶化了。虽然实行了配给，使每一个人分配到一点东西，勉强维持生命，加尔各答贫民因营养不良死亡的速度，超过了近年以来的任何时候。
    一个星期又一个星期，愈来愈多的加尔各答贫民在维持一家生活的最后战斗中失败。如果他们失败了，他们就搬到街道去居住、睡觉。
    最近以来，每天都有一千多人领取穆里克基金会（一个印度教的救济组织——译注）施舍的一勺达尔豆和大米（指合煮的熟食——译注）。但是这种公共的伙食，并没有除掉加尔各答街道上习以为常的景象——奄奄待毙的印度人失去了知觉地躺在街头。这些行将倒毙的人获得一点尊严的唯一希望，是为特里萨修女主持的医院所收容。不幸，特里萨修女医院只有两个大病房，由于床位极其有限，一个被收容的人如果在一个月内还没有死去，就被送回到原来发现他的地方，以便把床位腾给别人。平时，这个医院每月收容八十至九十个无家可归的人，每月的死亡率是三十人至四十人——全都由于营养不良。但是近来，每月收容量超过一百二十人，死亡者也增加到六十至七十人。
