    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 21st. The Vietnamese newspaper *Nhan Dan* published a commentary on the 21st, strongly condemning the Indonesian pro-American reactionary forces for sabotaging and seizing the Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta.

    The commentary said that a group of thugs directed by the Indonesian pro-American reactionary forces attacked the Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta again on the 20th. They unreasonably broke into the Chinese consulate, tore down the Chinese flag, carried out wanton destruction, and illegally seized this Chinese diplomatic mission.

    The commentary pointed out that the Indonesian pro-American reactionary forces have once again blatantly violated China's sovereignty and seriously trampled on international law and international practice. This is an insidious provocative act aimed at completely undermining the relations between China and Indonesia.

    The commentary expressed, along with world public opinion upholding justice, a strong condemnation of the Indonesian pro-American reactionary forces' frantic anti-China actions.

    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, April 21st. The Laotian newspaper *Lao Hak Sat* published a commentary on the 21st, condemning the Indonesian right-wing military clique, under the command of US imperialism, for massacring the Indonesian people and carrying out a series of anti-China activities.

    The commentary, entitled "The Indonesian Right-Wing Clique is Sliding Down a Dangerous Path," said that since the Indonesian right-wing clique launched a coup, they have intensified their cruel suppression and massacre of the Indonesian Communist Party and the Indonesian people. They have also unscrupulously taken a series of hostile actions against the People's Republic of China; they used barbaric methods to close the Xinhua News Agency's Jakarta branch, and blatantly and repeatedly launched armed attacks on the Chinese Embassy and consulates in Indonesia.

    The commentary pointed out that the Indonesian right-wing clique is a loyal lackey long nurtured by US imperialism. According to US imperialism's counter-revolutionary plan, they frantically destroy the revolutionary achievements of the Indonesian people and trample on the revolutionary spirit of the Indonesian people.

    The towering crimes they have committed are by no means accidental, but are carefully planned conspiracies under the instigation and direct command of US imperialism.

    The commentary concluded that the Indonesian people, under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, will surely overcome difficulties and achieve final victory. This is an objective law that cannot be changed by the will of the reactionaries.

    评论说，由印度尼西亚亲美反动势力指挥的一批暴徒，二十日又对中国驻雅加达总领事馆进行袭击。它们无理地冲进了中国领事馆，扯下中国国旗，大肆进行破坏，擅自强占中国的这一外交机关。

    这篇题为《印度尼西亚右派集团正沿着危险的道路滑下去》的评论说，自从印度尼西亚右派集团发动政变以后，他们就变本加厉地对印度尼西亚共产党和印度尼西亚人民进行残酷的镇压和屠杀。他们还肆无忌惮地对中华人民共和国采取了一系列的敌视行动；他们使用野蛮的手段封闭了新华社雅加达分社，并且明目张胆地多次武装袭击中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆和领事馆。
    评论指出，印度尼西亚右派集团是美帝国主义豢养已久的忠实走狗，他们根据美帝国主义的反革命计划，猖狂地破坏印度尼西亚人民的革命果实，蹂躏印度尼西亚人民的革命精神。

    评论最后说，印度尼西亚人民在印度尼西亚共产党的领导下必将战胜艰险获得最后胜利，这是不以反动派的意志为转移的客观规律。
