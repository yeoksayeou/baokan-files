    The Peking Opera "Raid on the White Tiger Regiment," performed by the Shandong Peking Opera Troupe, was an outstanding production at the 1964 Peking Opera Modern Drama Festival. After the festival, under the leadership of the Party, the comrades of the troupe, with a spirit of continuous revolution, made significant revisions to the script and performance, greatly enhancing the ideological and artistic qualities of the play.

    In the process of revising and refining the script and performance, they first used Mao Zedong Thought as a guide to elevate and deepen the theme. Chairman Mao's thought on people's war is more vividly and profoundly reflected in the play. To further shape the heroic image of Yan Weicai, they rewrote the scenes "Reconnaissance" and "Request to Fight." "Reconnaissance" was originally just a transitional scene, but now it stands alone as a full scene. The enrichment and strengthening of this scene creates a solid premise for the "Request to Fight" scene. When the regimental leaders were studying the battle plan, Yan Weicai answered the regimental leaders' inquiries, believing that the reconnaissance squad could insert itself from the area where the enemy was most heavily equipped and guarded. Because this area had many different enemy troop types and complex unit designations, it was suitable for the commando squad to infiltrate in disguise. This military thinking, which is good at discovering and exploiting the enemy's weaknesses, taking them by surprise, demonstrates that the character is good at creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, thereby enriching and enhancing the character's image.

    The revised and refined "Raid on the White Tiger Regiment" prominently demonstrates that Yan Weicai was able to undertake such an important task and achieve brilliant victory precisely because he was armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the ideological red line that runs through the entire play. The arias and accompaniment in the play also have new creations. After the revised "Raid on the White Tiger Regiment" was performed, it aroused a strong reaction in the Shanghai literary and art circles. Everyone unanimously expressed their determination to learn from their spirit of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and their dedication to excellence.

    《奇袭白虎团》锦上添花
    山东省京剧团演出的《奇袭白虎团》，是一九六四年京剧现代戏观摩演出中的优秀剧目。会演以后，剧团的同志们在党的领导下，以不断革命的精神，从剧本到演出作了重大的修改，使这出戏的思想性和艺术性得到了很大的提高。
    在剧本和演出的加工修改中，首先以毛泽东思想为指导提高与深化了主题，毛主席人民战争的思想，在戏中有了更加鲜明、更加深刻的体现。为了进一步塑造严伟才的英雄形象，改写了《侦察》和《请战》两场戏，《侦察》原来只是一个过场，现在单独作为一场。由于这场戏的丰富与加强，就给《请战》一场创造了坚实的前提。在团首长研究作战方案时，严伟才回答团首长的询问，认为侦察班可以从敌人配备最强、戒备最严的地方插入。因为这一带敌人的兵种多，番号复杂，正适合尖刀班化妆潜入。这种善于发现和利用敌人弱点，出其不意，攻其不备的军事思想，说明人物善于活学活用毛泽东思想，从而丰富和提高了人物形象。
    修改加工后的《奇袭白虎团》，突出地表明严伟才所以能够担当这样一个重大任务，并取得辉煌的胜利，正是由于毛泽东思想武装了他。毛泽东思想是贯穿全剧的思想红线。戏中的唱腔和伴奏也都有新的创造。修改后的《奇袭白虎团》演出后，在上海文艺戏剧界引起强烈的反应。大家一致表示要向他们活学活用毛主席著作和精益求精的精神学习。
