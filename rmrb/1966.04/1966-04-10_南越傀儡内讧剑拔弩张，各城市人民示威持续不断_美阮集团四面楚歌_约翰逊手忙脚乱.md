    (Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, 9th) Reports from Saigon: The internal strife within the South Vietnamese puppet clique continues to develop, with various factions of running dogs drawing their swords and unable to reach a compromise. At the same time, mass demonstrations by the people in enemy-occupied cities against the U.S.-puppet group continue unabated, placing the U.S.-puppet group in a situation of being besieged on all sides.
    According to Western news agencies, the situation is very tense in the major cities of the South Vietnamese U.S.-puppet controlled area, such as Saigon, Da Nang, and Hue. Despite the U.S.'s best efforts to intervene, it has so far failed to quell the internal strife within the puppet clique. The contradictions between the Nguyen Cao Ky group, the puppet prime minister, and the supporters of Nguyen Chanh Thi in Da Nang, Hue, and other opposition factions, remain at a fever pitch. With the support of the United States, Nguyen Cao Ky used transport planes dispatched by the U.S. military on the 5th to airlift two battalions of troops to the Da Nang U.S. Air Force Base, attempting to use force to restore control over Da Nang. However, his opponents did not show weakness either, sending troops to guard the highway leading from the U.S. military base to downtown Da Nang, setting up roadblocks, and confronting Nguyen Cao Ky's troops. Phan Xuan Luan, commander of the puppet army's 1st Division in Hue, announced on the same day that he would no longer obey the Nguyen Cao Ky regime in Saigon and deployed tanks in the city for defense. Nguyen Cao Ky went to the Da Nang U.S. military base on the 5th to negotiate with Nguyen Van Thieu, commander of the puppet army's 1st Corps. Although it was later claimed that the two sides had reached a "compromise solution on a political solution," in reality, the various factions of running dogs still refused to give way to each other. On the 8th, Nguyen Cao Ky dispatched planes loaded with bombs and rockets to circle over the headquarters of the puppet army's 1st Corps as a show of force, and repeatedly made low-altitude dives, forcing Nguyen Van Thieu to go to Saigon for negotiations. According to reports, Nguyen Van Thieu was immediately dismissed by Nguyen Cao Ky after arriving in Saigon. Western news agencies said that the tense situation was further aggravated by Nguyen Cao Ky's "display of force." In Da Nang, on the highway leading from the U.S. military base to downtown Da Nang, the two factions of troops "pointed their machine guns and artillery at each other across two barbed wire fences." In downtown Da Nang, tanks and anti-aircraft guns were also deployed around the headquarters of the puppet army's 1st Corps. Nguyen Van Thieu's chief of staff threatened that if Nguyen Cao Ky's troops were to forcibly enter the city, his troops would be "prepared to conduct a defensive war."
    In Saigon, under the direction of the United States, Nguyen Cao Ky is playing the trick of so-called "phased handover of power" in order to appease other factions of running dogs and ease the dissatisfaction of the broad masses of the people. According to reports, in recent days, U.S. officials and Nguyen Cao Ky have been frequently conducting bargaining negotiations with other factions. Nguyen Cao Ky has claimed that he "will accelerate the constitutional process," "establish a constitutional assembly as soon as possible," and "accelerate the establishment of a democratic civilian institution." The Nguyen Cao Ky group also announced that it will hold a "National Political Congress" in the near future in order to "discuss the drafting of the constitution."
    According to reports, as the internal strife within the puppet clique intensifies and Nguyen Cao Ky's opponents continue to organize demonstrations, the broad masses of the people in cities such as Saigon have also risen up to oppose U.S. imperialism and the Nguyen Cao Ky military dictatorship group, demanding the downfall of Nguyen Cao Ky's traitorous regime and demanding that U.S. imperialism get out of South Vietnam. In recent days, mass demonstrations in Saigon have continued every day. On the 5th, demonstrators burned a U.S. military jeep and rushed to the U.S. "Embassy" and U.S. military dormitories, scaring the U.S.-puppet authorities into hurriedly dispatching a large number of U.S. military police and puppet police to guard the U.S. "Embassy." On the evening of the 7th, demonstrators burned another U.S. military jeep and angrily beat a U.S. soldier. On the 8th, a large-scale demonstration against the U.S.-puppet group broke out again. Western news agency reports said that the demonstrators were obviously very emotional, and they specifically looked for Americans to beat, attacked U.S. military dormitories, and chased U.S. cars, beating "Americans fled in droves," and some U.S. soldiers fled through the crowd in a panic "carrying some personal belongings," making a complete fool of themselves.
    The U.S. government is deeply disturbed by the situation in South Vietnam. Johnson has been "closely watching" the situation in recent days and has discussed it with Rusk and McNamara.
    William Bundy, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, said in a television interview on the 8th that "the demonstrations there now are mixed with a lot of nationalism." He also said worriedly, "I think we have to expect that this sentiment will occasionally manifest itself in anti-American slogans." State Department spokesman Wright also admitted on the 8th that "the situation is unstable and is developing." (Attached picture)

    南越傀儡内讧剑拔弩张，各城市人民示威持续不断
    美阮集团四面楚歌　约翰逊手忙脚乱
    据新华社九日讯　西贡消息：南越傀儡集团内讧正在继续发展，各派走狗剑拔弩张，相持不下。同时，敌占区城市人民群众反对美伪集团的示威持续不断，美伪集团正陷入四面楚歌的困境。
    据西方通讯社报道，南越美伪统治区的主要城市西贡、岘港、顺化等地，目前的局势十分紧张。尽管美国竭力干预，至今也未能平息傀儡集团的内讧。伪总理阮高其集团同岘港、顺化等地的阮正诗支持者以及其他反对派的矛盾，仍然处于白热化状态。阮高其在美国的支持下，五日用美国军方派遣的运输机把两营军队空运到岘港美国空军基地，企图用武力恢复对岘港的控制。但是，他的对手也不示弱，派兵把守着从美军基地通往岘港市区的公路，设置路障，同阮高其的军队对峙。顺化的伪军第一师师长潘春伦在同一天宣布不再听命于西贡的阮高其政权，并且把坦克开入市内布防。阮高其在五日曾跑到岘港美军基地同伪第一军军长阮文准进行谈判。尽管事后宣称双方已就“政治解决达成妥协办法”，但是实际上各派走狗仍互不相让。阮高其在八日又出动满载炸弹和火箭的飞机在伪第一军总部的上空盘旋示威，并且多次低飞俯冲，迫使阮文准到西贡去谈判。据报道，阮文准到西贡后，立即被阮高其免职。西方通讯社说，由于阮高其“显示力量”，紧张的局势更加剧了。在岘港，在美军基地通往岘港市区的公路上，两派军队“隔着两道铁丝网，互相把机枪和大炮对准对方”。在岘港市内，伪第一军总部的周围也部署了坦克和高射炮。阮文准的参谋长扬言，如果阮高其的军队要强行进入市区，他的军队“准备进行自卫战”。
    在西贡，在美国的导演下，阮高其正在玩弄所谓“分阶段交出政权”的骗局，以安抚其他各派走狗，缓和广大人民的不满。据报道，近几天来，美国官员和阮高其同其他派系频繁地进行讨价还价的谈判。阮高其扬言，他“将加速进行立宪程序”，“尽快建立制宪议会”，“加速成立民主的文职机构”。阮高其集团还宣布，将在最近先举行“全国政治代表大会”，以便“讨论起草宪法问题”。
    据报道，在傀儡集团内讧加剧、阮高其的反对派不断组织示威的同时，西贡等城市的广大人民也群起反对美帝国主义和阮高其军事独裁集团，要求阮高其的卖国政权下台，要求美帝国主义滚出南越。近几天来，西贡的群众示威天天持续不断。五日，示威群众烧毁了一辆美军吉普车，并且涌向美国“大使馆”和美军宿舍，吓得美伪当局急忙调动大批美国宪兵和伪军警看守美国“大使馆”。七日晚上，示威群众又烧毁了一辆美军吉普车，并且怒打一个美国兵。八日，又爆发了大规模的反对美伪集团的示威。西方通讯社的报道说，示威的群众显然情绪很激烈，他们专找美国人打，袭击美军宿舍，追赶美国汽车，打得“美国人纷纷逃命”，一些美国兵慌慌张张地“挟着一些私人财物穿过人群逃跑”，丑态百出。
    美国政府对南越局势深为不安。约翰逊连日来一直“密切注视着”局势，并且同腊斯克和麦克纳马拉进行了讨论。
    美国远东事务助理国务卿威·邦迪八日在电视谈话中说，“目前在那里的示威掺杂着许多民族主义情绪”。他还忧心忡忡地说，“我认为我们必须预计到，这种情绪不时会在反美口号中表现出来。”国务院发言人赖特八日也承认说，“局势是不安定的，并且正在发展。”（附图片）
