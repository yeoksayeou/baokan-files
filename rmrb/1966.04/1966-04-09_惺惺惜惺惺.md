　　The British newspaper *The Guardian* wrote: "If colonialism can be explained as one country using another country to achieve its own goals, then the U.S. government's role in Vietnam is very much like that of a colonizer." In fact, the U.S. is not "very much like" a colonizer; it is simply an out-and-out colonizer.
　　Another British bourgeois newspaper, the *Daily Express*, loudly exclaimed: Regarding the U.S. situation in South Vietnam, "Britain should be the first country to sympathize with its allied nation suffering from anxiety. Because Britain has been in the position the U.S. is in now many times in the past."
　　Birds of a feather flock together, is this what they mean?

    惺惺惜惺惺
    英国《卫报》写道：“如果可以把殖民主义解释为一个国家利用另一个国家来达到自己的目的的话，那么美国政府在越南的角色就很象是殖民者”。其实美国哪里是“很象”，根本就是不折不扣的殖民者。
    而另一家英国资产阶级报纸《每日快报》则大声疾呼：对于美国在南越的处境，“英国应该是头一个同情它为忧虑所苦的盟国的国家。因为英国过去曾多次处于美国目前所处的地位。”
    惺惺惜惺惺，此之谓欤？
