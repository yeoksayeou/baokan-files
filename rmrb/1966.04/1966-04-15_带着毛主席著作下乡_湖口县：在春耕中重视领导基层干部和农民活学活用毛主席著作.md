    Bringing Chairman Mao's Works to the Countryside
    Hukou County: Hukou County Emphasizes Leaders, Grassroots Cadres and Peasants' Flexible Study and Application of Chairman Mao's Works During Spring Plowing
    (Our Nanchang dispatch) Hukou County in Jiangxi Province pays attention to highlighting politics and strengthening ideological and political leadership in leading spring plowing production, so preparatory work is better than in previous years. The fertilizer accumulated in the two and a half months of this spring is equal to the total amount of fertilizer accumulated throughout last year. The spring repairs to water conservancy facilities have resulted in greater water storage capacity and better quality. The old cotton seeds that the county has not changed for more than ten years have been selected and replaced with new cotton seeds.
    In the past, when Hukou County led preparatory work for plowing, it always assigned tasks at the beginning, grasped progress in the middle, and demanded numbers at the end; however, the tasks, progress, and numbers of many communes and teams often failed to meet the county's requirements. Last winter and this spring, the Hukou County Committee of the Communist Party of China summarized past work and discussed how the county committee could achieve revolutionization. Everyone realized that the fundamental reason why Hukou County was lagging behind fraternal counties was that the county committee's leadership in production did not highlight politics enough, and it did not regularly educate cadres and commune members with socialist thought.
    This year, as soon as the preparatory work for plowing began, the county committee organized a large number of county and commune cadres to go to the countryside with Chairman Mao's works to help grassroots cadres and the masses study Chairman Mao's works, combine this with summarizing last year's work, and thoroughly examine ideological gaps, conducting ideological education among commune members on farming for the revolution.
    Cadres who went to Sanli Commune to help with work found that the progress of spring repairs to water conservancy was not fast. What was the reason? After in-depth understanding, it turned out that the average grain yield per mu in this commune had reached 700 jin last year. Many people believed that there was enough grain to eat, and the contribution to the country was not small. The pace of farmland capital construction could be slowed down. After clarifying the situation, the county and commune cadres first organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's relevant works, and launched a major debate on the relationship between farming and revolution throughout the commune. Most grassroots cadres and the masses further understood the principle that farming is also revolution, and their political and ideological awareness was greatly improved, and they enthusiastically engaged in spring repair of water conservancy.
    After preparatory work for plowing entered a tense and busy stage, the Hukou County Committee insisted on carrying out ideological and political work, paying attention to grasping the living thoughts on the "battlefield," mobilizing cadres and commune members to study and apply Chairman Mao's works flexibly with problems in mind, and further promoting preparatory work for plowing.
    Liushi Commune was building a dike. Liu Xueqin, deputy secretary of the county party committee, and Zhang Li, secretary of the commune party committee, heard some commune members say while working on the section: "This dike is so long, how can it be built this year? Anyway, when it's time to plant rice, we'll have to be called down to the dike." They analyzed the situation of building this dike from the actual situation and believed that there were many favorable conditions. As long as the enthusiasm of the commune members was mobilized and the sentiments of fear of difficulty and hardship among the commune members were overcome, it was entirely possible to build the dike on schedule. They organized the laborers to study "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and encouraged everyone to have the confidence to "make up our minds, fear no sacrifice, get rid of all difficulties to win victory." After studying, the laborers said with full confidence that since we have made up our minds to overcome waterlogging and produce more grain and cotton for the revolution, we should not be afraid of difficulties or sweating. On the second day, as soon as they started work, everyone loaded more and ran faster, and the average work efficiency of the entire construction site was increased from three cubic meters to more than five cubic meters, and the dike soil was compacted and the dam foot was made wide. In fifteen days, the dike was built.
    Maying Commune, located in a semi-hilly area, has relatively few fertilizer sources and mainly relies on digging pond mud and human and animal manure. After the commune's grain yield per mu exceeded the "Program" last year, some production teams became complacent and relaxed their winter fertilizer accumulation activities. After learning about this situation, the commune party committee organized commune members to study "Get Rid of the Baggage and Start the Machine" at the beginning of this year. Some production team cadres and commune members said, "We didn't actively think of ways and shouted that there was no fertilizer to accumulate. This is carrying an eight-hundred-jin burden." After awareness was raised, the commune members actively carried out fertilizer accumulation activities. Some production teams braved the snow to pick up wild manure from places more than ten miles away and went to the county seat to pick up human and animal manure. Some production teams broke the ice to collect pond mud. All 178 production teams in the commune increased the accumulation of more than 100 dan of base fertilizer per mu for more than 3,100 mu of farmland within a month. Poor peasant commune members Li Zhiqin and others said excitedly: "Chairman Mao taught people to be smart. As long as people listen to Chairman Mao, difficulties will listen to people."

### 带着毛主席著作下乡  湖口县：在春耕中重视领导基层干部和农民活学活用毛主席著作

    带着毛主席著作下乡
    湖口县：在春耕中重视领导基层干部和农民活学活用毛主席著作
    本报南昌讯　江西省湖口县在领导春耕生产中注意突出政治，加强思想政治领导，备耕工作比往年好。今春两个半月积的肥料，等于去年全年积肥的总和。春修水利工程设施，蓄水量大，质量好。全县十多年没换过的老棉种，已选换了新棉种。
    湖口县往年领导备耕，总是开头交任务，中间抓进度，结尾要数目；可是不少社队的任务、进度、数目，总是达不到县里的要求。去冬今春，中共湖口县委总结了过去的工作，就县委如何实现革命化进行了讨论。大家认识到，湖口县落在兄弟县后面的根本原因，是县委领导生产突出政治不够，没有经常用社会主义思想教育干部和社员。
    今年备耕刚开始，县委就组织大批县、社干部带着毛主席著作下乡，帮助基层干部和群众学习毛主席著作，结合总结去年工作，大找思想差距，向社员进行为革命种田的思想教育。
    到三里公社去帮助工作的干部，发现这个公社春修水利的进度不快。是什么原因呢？经过深入了解，原来这个公社去年粮食平均亩产已达到七百斤，许多人认为粮食已经够吃了，对国家的贡献也不小，农田基本建设的脚步可以放慢一些了。弄清情况之后，县、社干部首先组织大家学习毛主席有关著作，并在全社范围内展开了一场种田和革命的关系的大辩论。大多数基层干部和群众，进一步弄明白了种田也是革命的道理，政治思想觉悟大大提高，热火朝天地投入春修水利活动中。
    备耕进入紧张繁忙阶段以后，湖口县委坚持进行思想政治工作，注意抓“战场”上的活思想，发动干部和社员带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，进一步推动备耕。
    流泗公社正在修筑一条圩堤。县委副书记刘学勤和公社党委书记张力，在工段劳动的时候，听到有的社员说：这么长的圩堤，今年那能修得起来，反正到栽禾的时候总得叫我们下堤。他们从实际出发分析了修筑这条圩堤的情况，认为有利条件不少，只要调动起社员群众的积极性，克服社员当中的畏难怕苦情绪，如期修成圩堤是完全可能的。他们组织民工学习《愚公移山》，鼓舞了大家“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的信心。民工们学习后，信心十足地说，我们既然下定了战胜涝害的决心，要为革命多产粮棉，就不应该怕困难，怕流汗。第二天一开工，人人多装快跑，整个工地的平均工效也由三方提高到了五方多，而且堤土打得紧，坝脚做得宽，十五天的时间，就把圩堤修好了。
    地处半丘陵地区的马影公社，肥源比较少，主要靠挖塘泥和人畜粪。去年这个公社粮食亩产超“纲要”以后，有的生产队就满足起来，放松了冬季积肥活动。公社党委了解这一情况之后，今年一开春就组织社员学习《放下包袱，开动机器》。有些生产队的干部和社员说，我们没有积极想办法，就喊没肥可积，这是背上八百斤的包袱了。认识提高以后，社员们积极开展了积肥活动。有的生产队冒雪到十几里路远的地方去捡野粪，到县城去捡人畜粪。有的生产队破冰取塘泥。全社一百七十八个生产队，一个月内就为三千一百多亩田地，每亩增积了上百担基肥。贫农社员李直勤等兴奋地说：“毛主席把人教聪明了。只要人听毛主席的话，困难就会听人的话。”
