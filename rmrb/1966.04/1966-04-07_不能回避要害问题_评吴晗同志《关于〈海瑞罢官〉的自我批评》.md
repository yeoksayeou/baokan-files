    Unable to Avoid the Crucial Issues
    —A Critique of Comrade Wu Han’s “Self-Criticism on ‘Hai Rui Dismissed from Office’”
    Fang Qiu
    Summary: The crux of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" lies in political issues, and the crux of political issues lies in the "dismissal" issue. Through his work, Comrade Wu Han placed political praise, sympathy, and hope on the anti-Party, anti-socialist "hero" who was "dismissed" from "office," while splashing political mud, filth, condemnation, and curses on the Party. Whether when he wrote "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" in the past, or when he wrote the so-called "self-criticism" on "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" now, Comrade Wu Han has sharply raised a political challenge. Why do some of our comrades place politics and class struggle outside their field of vision, treating everything as a purely "academic issue" that has nothing to do with politics?
    We have studied Comrade Wu Han's "Self-Criticism on 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office.'" We agree with Comrade Si Tong's evaluation of it: This is a challenge.①
    You criticize my "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and articles about Hai Rui? My play and related articles were written after the "Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was held in Lushan, Jiangxi, from August 2 to 16, 1959"! They were written in response to the "great call" of this meeting! They were written to "oppose right-leaning opportunism"!
    This is a sharp, political challenge.
    This challenge is a good thing.
    Without this challenge, some of our comrades would still be naively complaining: Why drag the criticism of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" into politics? Isn't this confusing academic issues with political issues? And so on, endlessly entangled. With this challenge, these comrades can think hard: Whether Comrade Wu Han raised the issue sharply from a political perspective in the past when he wrote "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," or now when he writes the so-called "self-criticism" on "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," why do these comrades place politics and class struggle outside their field of vision, treating everything as a purely "academic issue" that has nothing to do with politics?
    The People's Daily's editor's note advises readers to carefully read Comrade Wu Han's so-called "self-criticism." Reading such articles can help us clear our stuffy noses and increase our understanding of the world and our experience in class struggle.
    What is so peculiar about this article?
    The peculiarity lies in claiming to stand on the position of supporting the Party, while stubbornly insisting on portraying a representative work of anti-Party and anti-socialist thinking as a work responding to the Party's "great call"; the peculiarity lies in clearly singing praises to those right-leaning opportunists and other anti-Party and anti-people "heroes" who waved the banner of "pleading for the people," struggled against the Party, and were defeated and "dismissed" from "office," while stubbornly insisting that this is "opposing right-leaning opportunism."
    "Lifting a stone to drop it on one's own feet"—the logic of things runs contrary to Comrade Wu Han's wishes. Comrade Wu Han's new political challenge further exposes the political essence of his problems. The recently published articles, "The Reactionary Essence of 'Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor' and 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'" by Comrade Qi Benyu, and "'Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor' and 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office' are Two Big Poisonous Weeds Opposing the Party and Socialism" by Comrades Guan Feng and Lin Jie, have thoroughly analyzed the reactionary political essence of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and other works. We agree with their opinions.
    What kind of political reasons does Comrade Wu Han put forward in his challenge? Let's dissect them one by one.
    (I)
    The first reason Comrade Wu Han puts forward is that he clearly stated in his article "On Hai Rui" that he wanted to oppose right-leaning opportunism.
    In the article "On Hai Rui," there were indeed a few sentences about "opposing right-leaning opportunism." However, Marxism and the experience of class struggle tell us that the essence of a propaganda or an idea cannot be judged solely on the basis of individual words or phrases. If we place the several sentences of "opposing right-leaning opportunism" in "On Hai Rui" into the context of Comrade Wu Han's entire propaganda about Hai Rui, and place Comrade Wu Han's entire propaganda about Hai Rui into the practice of class struggle, then things become very clear: these sentences are something attached and detached from the main theme of Comrade Wu Han's entire propaganda, are incompatible with his entire propaganda main theme, and will not be mentioned again later. Now Comrade Wu Han solemnly emphasizes these sentences, which are not his original intention at all, for nothing more than to confuse the public and deceive the readers.
    Comrade Wu Han's propaganda about Hai Rui began with "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and culminated in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office." "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" was published on June 16, 1959. What time was that? It was precisely on the eve of the Lushan Conference, when right-leaning opportunists were unusually active, spouting nonsense, and in every corner, cursing the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, with insinuations and open attacks. At this time, Comrade Wu Han wrote the article "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor." In the article, he dressed up Hai Rui, a feudal official loyal to the emperor, as an "opposition" who "stood on the side of the people" and opposed the emperor, and portrayed Hai Rui's actions of directly advising the emperor for the fundamental interests of the feudal ruling class as thinking of the interests of the people, speaking on behalf of the masses, and revolutionary behavior of "scolding" the emperor face to face. This description has nothing to do with the historical Hai Rui; in real political life, it can only be to establish a "model" for those right-leaning opportunists and all anti-Party and anti-people "opposition," to encourage them to draw "spiritual strength" from here, impersonate Hai Rui, and launch a frenzied attack on socialism.
    At the Lushan Conference, the attack of the right-leaning opportunists was defeated, their political faces of impersonating Hai Rui and impersonating spokespersons for the people were exposed, and their leaders were dismissed and "dismissed" from "office." However, some of them did not repent, but were accumulating strength and watching for opportunities. Sure enough, not long after, in 1961 and 1962, a right-leaning opportunist force, echoing the capitalist and feudal forces in society, and in coordination with the joint anti-China actions of imperialism, reactionaries of various countries, and modern revisionism, launched a new attack on our Party and socialism.
    "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" began writing at the end of 1959, took years, was revised seven times, was completed in November 1960, and was published and performed in 1961 and 1962. What is the theme of this play? Comrade Wu Han argues that the theme of the play is not land return, but eliminating bullies, attempting to divert people's attention with this entanglement. In fact, land return and eliminating bullies are all plots; all these plots culminate in one point—the "dismissal" clarified in the title of the play. A peasant "savior" who "returns land," "eliminates bullies," and "wants to be the master for the common people" is "dismissed" from "office," a "hero" who "stands on the side of the people," "pleads for the people," and fights fearlessly against the "tyranny" of the authorities is "dismissed" from "office"—this is the theme Comrade Wu Han is trying to explain to readers and audiences. Is this a description of history? Is it conceivable to make such absurd beautification of an official of the feudal ruling class in history? No, this is borrowing the clothes of ancient people to disguise living people, using historical themes to express resentment about reality, and using the stage to express support, regret, and injustice for right-leaning opportunists and all anti-Party and anti-people "heroes" who have been "dismissed" from "office."
    One "scolds" and one "dismisses." One is openly drumming for the rampant attack of right-leaning opportunists before the Lushan Conference, and the other is openly boosting the morale of right-leaning opportunists who have been "dismissed" from "office" after the Lushan Conference. This is the real political meaning of Comrade Wu Han's entire propaganda about Hai Rui in recent years. This is the real political relationship between this propaganda and the right-leaning opportunist, anti-Party, and anti-socialist thinking at that time.
    Therefore, the crux of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" lies in political issues, and the crux of political issues lies in the "dismissal" issue. Through "dismissal," Comrade Wu Han tried to shape his protagonist into a tall artistic image of a tragic hero. He placed the political titles of "defender of the people's interests" and "spokesperson for the people's suffering" on the "hero" who was "dismissed" from "office," while smearing all kinds of political mud and filth on the Party; he poured all his political sympathy on the "hero" who was "dismissed" from "office," while throwing all kinds of political condemnation and curses on the Party; he pinned his political hopes on the "hero" who was "dismissed" from "office," while venting feelings of determination and disappointment on the Party. Comrade Wu Han said with infinite indignation: "In this era, the better the official, the more likely he is to lose his office."② Please see, what is expressed here is no longer dissatisfaction with a temporary event, but the hope to use the description of the "hero" being "dismissed" from office to condemn "this era" and this world, that is, to condemn the Party and the current revolutionary era led by the Party from the overall and fundamental level. This is the extremely dark and extremely reactionary political feeling that "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" tries to promote to people and tries to arouse resonance in some people.
    Promoting "land return" is certainly a very important political issue, but compared with "dismissal," "land return" is in a subordinate position. "Land return" is an important part of the political program of the "hero" who was dismissed from office, and the political feeling expressed by the description of "dismissal" is a deeper and broader political generalization.
    Comrade Wu Han's "Self-Criticism on 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'" does not touch on this real political meaning of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" at all, and tries to avoid this crucial issue, but instead wants to dress it up as a work that "responds to the call of the Lushan Conference" and "opposes right-leaning opportunism." What kind of "self-criticism" is this?
    (II)
    The second reason Comrade Wu Han puts forward is that his propaganda texts about Hai Rui, "except for the preface to 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office,' were all written before 1960."
    What does this mean? This means that, in terms of time, "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," which was completed in November 1960, has nothing to do with the "reversal wind" and "going-it-alone wind" that blew in 1961, and "linking the play with this wind and that wind" is someone else's business.
    Comrade Wu Han is a historian. He runs to instruct us in the guise of a history professor that in studying socio-historical phenomena, we must cut them into individual fragments and treat them as isolated events without cause, history, or the process of occurrence and development. Then he shows off his tricks of chronological research, thinking that this can cover up the true historical connection. Isn't this a typical deceptive method of bourgeois historiography?
    However, hiding the head to reveal the tail. Comrade Wu Han tried his best to hide the connection between "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and the "reversal wind" of 1961 and 1962, but he did not expect that he would expose its connection with the "dismissal" of right-leaning opportunists in 1959. Grasping this key point enables us to have a deeper and clearer understanding of the intrinsic connection between "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and the "reversal wind."
    What is the "reversal wind"? The "reversal wind" is first and foremost some right-leaning opportunists who have been dismissed from office stirring up reversals. All historical processes advance in the struggle of opposition. There will be struggles against right-leaning opportunists as much as there are attacks from them. As much as there are failures from right-leaning opportunists, there will be a portion of right-leaning opportunists who are unwilling to repent, as well as their sympathizers, who are unwilling to accept their failure and try to salvage it. Comrade Wu Han asked people to learn from his Hai Rui's "strong will not to be succumbed to tyranny, not to be intimidated by failure, and to try again after failure," praised his Hai Rui's spirit of "not succumbing and not being discouraged after being dismissed from office," and hoped that his Hai Rui would "return to office one day to reorganize the rules," isn't that what he meant? Therefore, in some people's minds, the intention of reversing the verdict comes with the verdict and has always existed since the verdict. However, under certain class struggle situations, it is a hidden undercurrent, or only sporadic starts. When a "reversal wind" can be stirred up depends on the combination of various historical conditions. To understand the "reversal wind" of 1961 and 1962, we must first regard it as a reaction to the struggle against right-leaning opportunism in 1959, and regard it as the emergence and development of the undercurrent that already existed in 1959 and 1960 under new conditions. Putting the writing, publication, performance, and publication of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" in such a historical connection makes its "creative intention and historical background" very clear, doesn't it? What kind of defense can "completed in November 1960" provide for Comrade Wu Han?
    As for advocating "going it alone" and "returning land" as an integral part of the political program of right-leaning opportunists and other anti-Party and anti-people "heroes," it has been a long-standing issue. Collectivization is the socialist road in the countryside, and going it alone, as its opposite, is the capitalist road in the countryside. The struggle between these two roads runs through the entire historical process of socialist revolution in our country's rural areas and has had several ups and downs over the past decade. Impersonating peasant "saviors," raising the banner of "pleading for the people," and opposing cooperation (opposing communization after 1958) is a common method used by the bourgeoisie in its struggles with the proletariat. These are not new inventions after 1961. How can Comrade Wu Han pretend to be confused and say that he was unaware of them all in November 1960?
    Here, we also need to clarify a question: How do literary and artistic works reflect class struggle and social life? News reports record specific events that have already occurred in social life, and their appearance can only be after the events occur. Literary and artistic works reflect class trends and social ideologies, taking the development of all social life and class struggle as the background. It is an active reflection, which in many cases is different from the news record of specific events. Literature and art are the keen sensory organs of the class. They can detect the turbulent undercurrents in social life and can sense the coming of brewing changes. Literature and art are the class's mouthpiece, which shouts out the class's heart, not only as the echo of class changes, but often as the herald and accompaniment of class changes. Literature and art are the weathervane of class struggle, which can indicate the wind direction when the wind is just rising at the end of the green algae. Revolutionary literature and art are like this, and reactionary literature and art are also like this. Look at the history of class struggle on our literary and artistic front. Almost every wave of bourgeois attacks first showed signs and sent signals from the literary and artistic aspects, and literature and art fueled the waves. The political offensive of the bourgeois rightists peaked in May and June 1957; the "gongs and drums of movies" of the rightists in the literary and artistic circles were struck at the beginning of the year, and "The Early Spring Weather of Intellectuals" was published in March. The political offensive of the right-leaning opportunists peaked at the Lushan Conference; "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" was published on the eve of the conference. The most recent political offensive of the bourgeoisie peaked in 1961, especially in 1962; "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," "Li Hui Niang," and "Xie Yao Huan" were written, performed, and published at the end of 1960 or the beginning and middle of 1961. Doesn't such a timetable clearly illustrate the regularity of literature and art keenly and actively reflecting class struggle?
    Therefore, on the one hand, singing praises to the "hero" who has been dismissed from office on the stage, and on the other hand, the right-leaning opportunists who have been "dismissed" from office in social life stirring up a "reversal wind"; on the one hand, shouting to "return land" on the stage, and on the other hand, a "going-it-alone wind" blowing in social life—the appearance of these two aspects of phenomena at about the same time in a period around 1961, echoing each other, is by no means accidental and unrelated. They are both products of the historical development and current changes of class struggle in our country, and are both governed by a law of class struggle ups and downs. From the perspective of social ideology, the former actively reflects the latter and serves the latter.
    (III)
    The third reason Comrade Wu Han puts forward is that the purpose of his writing "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was "unclear and muddled at the time," and it was "completely for the sake of the past and for the sake of writing a play."
    Here, Comrade Wu Han turned his pen and picked up the cliches of the bourgeoisie. However, how can this tattered shield help Comrade Wu Han cover up the crucial point of the problem?
    Moreover, we remember that Comrade Wu Han's tone was very different from now when he wrote and performed "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office."
    In the preface and foreword of the play "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," Comrade Wu Han clearly stated that he had repeatedly considered the "practical significance" of the play's theme and believed that the Hai Rui he wrote was "worth learning today."③
    When "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" began to be staged and some people praised him as brothers, Comrade Wu Han, full of ambition, clearly stated again in a public letter thanking others for their congratulations that historical plays "the historical figures inside are by no means the resurrection of zombies, and writing about this person and playing this person should focus on a certain aspect of him or her that is enlightening to later generations," "not for the sake of the dead, but to serve the living," this is "not allowed to have any doubts."④
    In a series of articles on historical dramas, Comrade Wu Han also repeatedly promoted that "the purpose of historical dramas is for modern people to learn," "certain spirits of the past are helpful to today's needs,"⑤ to "use dead historical materials as living historical materials and closely combine them with current needs," "use the past to serve the present."⑥
    In many articles and speeches on learning history, Comrade Wu Han repeatedly explained: "Learning history is not only to acquire knowledge and experience of the past, but more importantly...to serve current politics,"⑦ "not a science that is divorced from politics, but a science with a strong political nature," "not to serve the dead, but to serve the living, not for the past, but for today and tomorrow."⑧
    Comrade Wu Han also publicly announced his own views on writing articles: "The purpose must be clear," "to write for a purpose," "an article that has nothing to 'do', no matter how smooth the text and coherent the tone, is empty in content and can only be classified as nonsense, it is better not to write it."⑨
    Such examples are too numerous to mention.
    Please see, how decisive these words are! Where is it that "never thought of the principle of using the past to serve the present"! Where is there the slightest "unclear purpose"! Where is there a moment of "being divorced from politics and reality"! How long ago did Comrade Wu Han change his face. What is the reason for this? It turns out that the times are different. At that time, Comrade Wu Han believed that the climate was suitable, so when he used the "past" to serve anti-socialist real politics, he enthusiastically promoted "using the past to serve the present," fearing that some people would not understand its practical intentions; but today, when the anti-socialist essence of this real politics has been exposed and criticized, he hurriedly puts on a confused look, saying that at that time he was "for the sake of the past and for the sake of writing a play," fearing that people would seize its practical intentions and hit its political key. However, the Wu Han of that day is refuting the Wu Han of today. Which Wu Han should we believe? In the contention of a hundred schools of thought, we welcome serious self-criticism, and we also welcome serious self-defense and counter-criticism. But why give us lies?
    There has never been literature and art for the sake of literature and art, or academics for the sake of academics. Literature and art and academics always belong to politics and serve politics in one way or another. The politics of the proletariat is the politics that serves the vast majority of people in the world. Therefore, the literature and art and academics of the proletariat never conceal their political purposes. The bourgeois and anti-socialist politics serve a very small number of people and oppose the vast majority of people. Therefore, the literature and art and academics that serve this kind of politics often have to conceal their political purposes from people; this is especially true under the dictatorship of the proletariat. The history of the struggle on the ideological front tells us that when you hear someone talking about literature and art for the sake of literature and art, academics for the sake of academics, etc., you must be careful that there are ghosts in it. Comrade Wu Han's defense of "for the sake of the past and for the sake of writing a play" once again confirms this political experience of people.
    (IV)
    Finally, let's take a look at the fourth reason Comrade Wu Han put forward. He said: "For more than 20 years, he has been under the education, cultivation, and care of the Party, and his political class position has been firmly established."
    "Political class position" is not an abstract thing. It is reflected in people's social practice, in people's words and actions, especially in the great storms of class struggle. Comrade Wu Han, from 1959 to 1961, you wrote and published propaganda texts from "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" to "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," etc., which supported right-leaning opportunists. Which class position did you firmly establish in politics? Now, in your "Self-Criticism on 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'," instead of examining your mistakes politically, you say that it is a work that responds to the call of the Party. Which class position did you firmly establish in politics again? Also, in the academic circles in 1961 and 1962, you raised a big banner against Marxism and launched a frenzied counterattack against the academic and cultural revolution since 1958, attempting to reverse the wheel of the socialist academic and cultural revolution and make it embark on the road of capitalist and feudalist academic and cultural restoration. Which class position did you firmly establish in politics again?
    Comrade Wu Han is very proud of his "more than 20 years." Here, we have no intention of commenting on Comrade Wu Han's political history of more than 20 years. We just want to point out that over the past 20 years, the revolution has been advancing, from the democratic revolution to the socialist revolution, and the socialist revolution has been deepening step by step. With the continuous advancement of the revolution, while the ranks of revolutionaries are constantly expanding, there is also a continuous re-differentiation and reorganization, which is the inevitable result of the deepening of the revolution. Whether we can constantly transform ourselves with the advancement of the revolution and keep up with the pace of the revolution is an extremely serious issue for every revolutionary. Revolutionary history cannot guarantee anyone politically. This can only depend on people's conscious, determined, and practical self-transformation in the revolutionary process. Without the consciousness of ideological transformation, then the bourgeois world outlook in their minds, the old ideas, old traditions, and old habits in their minds, must be reflected, must stubbornly express themselves in various ways on political and ideological issues, and must transform the world according to their own image. In this way, they will inevitably have profound conflicts with the Party, with socialism, and with the new development of the revolution at this or that juncture of class struggle. Are the fellow travelers of the Party in the democratic revolution separating from the Party at this or that station of the socialist revolution, or even going to the side of confrontation with the Party, rare events? Are the former left wings becoming the right wings of today rare events? The bourgeoisie especially wants to find such people to be their spokespersons because they were once left wings, have political capital and mass influence, and can play a role that the old right wings cannot play. They hang the banner of the left wing and actually become the new leaders supported by the right wing, acting as vanguards in the attack of capitalist and feudal forces on socialism.
    Comrade Stalin said: "The power of the revolution is also manifested in the fact that it does not bow down to 'celebrities,' but wants them to serve it. If they are unwilling to learn from it, it will throw them into the clouds." ("Many Bulls Surround Me" Complete Works Volume III Page 370)
    Completely putting down our airs, learning from the revolution, learning from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, learning from Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and completely breaking with the bourgeoisie from political position, world outlook to the depths of our feelings is the only road that all people who do not want to be thrown into the clouds by the revolution should choose.

### 不能回避要害问题——评吴晗同志《关于〈海瑞罢官〉的自我批评》

    不能回避要害问题
    ——评吴晗同志《关于〈海瑞罢官〉的自我批评》
    方求
    提要　《海瑞罢官》的要害在政治问题上，政治问题的要害又在“罢官”问题上。吴晗同志通过他的作品，把政治的赞美、同情和希望，寄托在被“罢”了“官”的反党、反社会主义“英雄”的身上，而把政治的烂泥、污秽、谴责和咒骂，抛洒到党的身上。吴晗同志无论过去写《海瑞罢官》的时候，还是现在写关于《海瑞罢官》的所谓“自我批评”的时候，都是尖锐地从政治上提出挑战的。我们有些同志为什么反倒把政治、把阶级斗争置于自己的视野之外，而把这一切都当作是什么与政治无干的纯粹“学术问题”呢？
    我们研究了吴晗同志的《关于〈海瑞罢官〉的自我批评》。我们同意思彤同志对它的评价：这是一个挑战。①
      你们批评我的《海瑞罢官》和关于海瑞的文章么？我的这出戏和有关文章，是“一九五九年八月二日至十六日在江西庐山举行了中国共产党第八届中央委员会第八次全体会议”以后写的！是响应这个会议的“伟大的号召”写的！是为了“反对右倾机会主义”写的！
    这是一个尖锐的、政治性的挑战。
    这个挑战，是一件好事。
    没有这个挑战，我们有些同志还在那里天真烂漫地抱怨：为什么要把对《海瑞罢官》的批评扯到政治上去呀，这样岂不是把学术问题同政治问题混为一谈了呀，如此等等，纠缠不清。有了这个挑战，这些同志就可以好好地想一想了，吴晗同志无论在他过去写《海瑞罢官》的时候，还是在他现在写关于《海瑞罢官》的所谓“自我批评”的时候，都是尖锐地从政治上提出问题的，我们这些同志怎么反倒把政治、把阶级斗争置于自己的视野之外，而把这一切都当作是什么与政治无干的纯粹“学术问题”呢？
    《人民日报》的编者按语，劝读者认真地看看吴晗同志的所谓“自我批评”。读读这样的文章，是很能帮助我们把塞了的鼻子开通起来，增长对世事的见识和阶级斗争的经验的。
    这篇文章的奇特处在哪里呢？
    奇就奇在自称站在拥护党的立场，却硬要把自己写的一部反党、反社会主义思潮的代表作，说成是响应党的“伟大的号召”的作品；奇就奇在分明是为那种打出“为民请命”的旗帜、同党斗争、遭到失败而被“罢”了“官”的右倾机会主义分子以及其他反党反人民的“英雄”唱颂歌，却硬要把这说成是在“反对右倾机会主义”。
      “搬起石头打自己的脚”，事物的逻辑走向吴晗同志愿望的反面。吴晗同志从政治上提出新的挑战，恰恰进一步暴露出他的问题的政治本质。最近发表的戚本禹同志的《〈海瑞骂皇帝〉和〈海瑞罢官〉的反动实质》和关锋、林杰同志的《〈海瑞骂皇帝〉和〈海瑞罢官〉是反党反社会主义的两株大毒草》，对《海瑞罢官》等作品的反动政治本质，作了透辟的分析，我们同意他们的意见。
    吴晗同志在他的挑战中从政治上提出了几条什么样的理由呢？我们把它一一剥开来看一看。
    （一）
    吴晗同志拿出来的第一条理由是，他在《论海瑞》这篇文章中，明明说过要反对右倾机会主义。
    在《论海瑞》这篇文章里，“反对右倾机会主义”的话，是有过几句的。但是，马克思主义和阶级斗争的经验告诉我们，判断一种宣传、一种思想的实质，不能仅仅根据个别的词句。如果把《论海瑞》中“反对右倾机会主义”的若干词句，放到吴晗同志关于海瑞的全部宣传中加以考察，把吴晗同志关于海瑞的全部宣传，放到阶级斗争的实践中加以考察，那么，事情就很清楚：这些词句，是游离于吴晗同志关于海瑞的全部宣传主旨以外的附加的东西，是同他的全部宣传主旨格格不入并且以后不再被提起的东西。现在吴晗同志煞有介事地把这些根本不是他的本意的词句，强调地提了出来，无非是为了混淆视听，欺骗读者而已。
    吴晗同志关于海瑞的宣传，开始于《海瑞骂皇帝》，归结到《海瑞罢官》。《海瑞骂皇帝》发表于一九五九年六月十六日。那是什么时候？正是庐山会议前夕，右倾机会主义分子异常活跃，大放厥词，在各个角落里向党中央和毛主席，向总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，阴一句、阳一句地进行咒骂的时候。在这个时候，吴晗同志写出了《海瑞骂皇帝》这篇文章。在文章里，他把忠于皇帝的封建官吏海瑞，打扮成“站在人民方面”而反对皇帝的“反对派”，把海瑞为着封建统治阶级的根本利益，向皇帝直言进谏的举动，说成是为人民利益着想，代人民群众说话，当面“骂”皇帝的革命行为。这种描写，同历史上的海瑞风马牛不相及；在现实政治生活中，则只能是为了给那些右倾机会主义分子和一切反党反人民的“反对派”树立一个“榜样”，要他们从这里吸取“精神力量”，假冒海瑞，去向社会主义猖狂进攻。
    在庐山会议上，右倾机会主义分子的进攻被击败了，他们假冒海瑞、假冒人民代言人的政治面貌被揭露了，他们的头目被撤了职、“罢”了“官”了。但是，他们中的一部分人并没有改悔，而在积蓄力量，窥测时机。果然，没有过多久，到了一九六一、一九六二年，一股右倾机会主义的势力，同社会上资本主义势力和封建势力相呼应，配合帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义的联合反华，向我们党、向社会主义发动了新的进攻。
    《海瑞罢官》在一九五九年年底动笔，历时经年，修改七次，在一九六○年十一月写成，一九六一、一九六二年发表与演出。这个剧本的主题是什么呢？吴晗同志力辩，剧本的主题不是退田，而是除霸，企图用这种纠缠来转移人们的视线。其实，退田也好，除霸也好，都是它的情节；所有这些情节，又都归结到一点——就是在剧本的题目上点明了的“罢官”。一个“退田”、“除霸”、“要为生民作主张”的农民“救星”被“罢”了“官”，一个“站在人民方面”、“为民请命”、同当道“强暴”作无畏斗争的“英雄”被“罢”了“官”，这就是吴晗同志竭力想要向读者和观众说明的主题思想。这难道是对历史的描写吗？对历史上一个封建统治阶级的官吏作这样荒谬绝伦的美化是可以设想的吗？不，这是借古人的衣冠来改扮活人的躯体，是借历史的题材来抒发对现实的愤懑，是借舞台的阵地来为被“罢”了“官”的右倾机会主义分子和一切反党反人民的“英雄”表示支持、惋惜和不平。
    一“骂”一“罢”。一个是在庐山会议以前公开给猖狂进攻的右倾机会主义分子敲边鼓，一个是在庐山会议以后公开给被“罢”了“官”的右倾机会主义分子鼓士气。这就是吴晗同志几年来有关海瑞的全部宣传的现实政治含义。这就是这种宣传同当时右倾机会主义的、反党反社会主义的思潮的真实政治关系。
    所以，《海瑞罢官》的要害在政治问题上，政治问题的要害又在“罢官”问题上。通过“罢官”，吴晗同志力图把他的主人公塑造成一个悲剧英雄的高大艺术形象。他把“人民利益的维护者”、“人民疾苦的代言人”的政治头衔安放在被“罢”了“官”的“英雄”身上，而把各种政治的烂泥、污秽涂抹到党的身上；他把自己的全部政治同情倾注在被“罢”了“官”的“英雄”身上，而把各种政治的谴责、咒骂抛洒到党的身上；他把自己的政治希望寄托在被“罢”了“官”的“英雄”身上，而把决绝、失望的情感宣泄在党的身上。吴晗同志无限愤慨地说：“这年头，越是好官，越要丢官。”②请看，这里表达的，已经完全不是什么对一时一事的不满，而是希望通过“英雄”被“罢官”的描写，对“这年头”、这世道，也就是从总体上、从根本上对党和党所领导的当前这个革命时代，提出谴责。这就是《海瑞罢官》力图向人们宣传，并且力图唤起某种人的共鸣的极其阴暗、极其反动的政治感情。
    宣传“退田”当然是很重要的政治问题，但是同“罢官”相比，“退田”是居于从属地位的。“退田”是被罢了官的“英雄”的政治纲领的一个重要部分，而对“罢官”的描写所表达的政治感情，则是一种更深、更广的政治概括。
    吴晗同志《关于〈海瑞罢官〉的自我批评》，根本不触及《海瑞罢官》的这个现实政治含义，极力回避这个要害问题，反而要把它打扮成“响应庐山会议号召”的“反对右倾机会主义”的作品，这算是一种怎样的“自我批评”呢？
    （二）
    吴晗同志拿出来的第二条理由是，他的关于海瑞的宣传文字，“除了《海瑞罢官》的序文以外，都是一九六○年以前写的”。
    这是什么意思呢？这就是说，从时间上讲，一九六○年十一月写成的《海瑞罢官》，同一九六一年刮起的“翻案风”、“单干风”沾不着边，“把剧本同这种风、那种风联系起来”，那是别人的事。
    吴晗同志是历史学家。他以一个史学教授的姿态跑来教导我们，在研究社会历史现象的时候，要把它们割成一个一个碎片，当作一件一件没有来由、没有历史、没有发生发展过程的孤立的事情，然后他再耍一通年代考证的花招，以为这样就可以把真实的历史联系掩盖起来，这不是一种典型的资产阶级史学的骗人方法么？
    可是，藏了头来又露尾。吴晗同志竭力想把《海瑞罢官》同一九六一、一九六二年“翻案风”的联系隐藏起来，却没有想到，反而把它同一九五九年右倾机会主义分子被“罢官”的联系暴露了出来。抓住了这个要害就使我们对《海瑞罢官》同“翻案风”的内在联系，有了更深刻、更清楚的理解。
    什么是“翻案风”？“翻案风”首先是一些被罢了官的右倾机会主义分子闹翻案。一切历史过程都是在对立的斗争中前进的。有右倾机会主义分子的进攻，就会有反对右倾机会主义分子的斗争。有右倾机会主义分子的失败，就会有一部分不肯悔改的右倾机会主义分子和他们的同情者，不甘心失败，力图挽救他们的失败。吴晗同志要求人们学习他的海瑞“不为强暴所屈，不为失败所吓倒，失败了再干的坚强意志”，赞扬他的海瑞“罢了官并不屈服，不丧气”的精神，盼望他的海瑞“有一日再居官重整纪纲”，不就是这个意思吗？所以，在一些人那里，翻案的意图是伴随定案而俱来的，是在定案以后就一直存在的，只不过在一定的阶级斗争形势下是一种隐伏的潜流，或者只有零星的发动。什么时候能够刮起一阵“翻案风”，那是取决于各种历史条件的综合的。要理解一九六一、一九六二年的“翻案风”，首先要把它看作是对一九五九年反对右倾机会主义的斗争的一种反动，看作是一九五九、一九六○年就已经存在的潜流在新的条件下的涌出和发展。把《海瑞罢官》的写作、发表、演出和出版，摆在这样的历史联系中一看，它的“创作意图和时代背景”不就很清楚了吗？“写成于一九六○年十一月”云云，又能为吴晗同志作怎样的辩解呢？
    至于鼓吹“单干”“退田”，作为被“罢”了“官”的右倾机会主义分子和其他反党反人民“英雄”的政治纲领的一个组成部分，更是由来已久的事情。集体化，是农村的社会主义道路，作为它的对立物的单干，是农村的资本主义道路。这两条道路的斗争，贯穿着我国农村社会主义革命的整个历史进程，十几年来，有过几番起伏。冒充农民“救星”，打起“为农民请命”的旗帜，反对合作化（一九五八年以后是反对公社化），是历次资产阶级同无产阶级作斗争的惯用方法。这些并不是一九六一年以后的新发明，吴晗同志怎么能够装糊涂，说他在一九六○年十一月都概不知晓呢？
    这里还需要弄清楚一个问题：文艺作品究竟怎样反映阶级斗争和社会生活？新闻报道记录社会生活中已经发生的具体事件，它的出现只能在事件发生以后。文艺作品反映阶级动向和社会思潮，是以全部社会生活和阶级斗争的发展为背景的，它是一种能动的反映，在许多情况下是不同于对具体事件的新闻记录的。文艺是阶级的敏锐的感觉器官，它能察觉社会生活中潜流的激荡，能感应酝酿中的变动的来临。文艺是阶级的喉舌，它把阶级的心声呼喊出来，不仅是阶级变动的回响，而且往往是阶级变动的先声和伴唱。文艺是阶级斗争的风信鸡，它能指示风向，当风刚刚起于青萍之末的时候。革命的文艺是这样，反动的文艺也是这样。请看看我们文艺战线阶级斗争的历史，几乎每一次资产阶级进攻的风浪，都是首先从文艺方面显出征兆，发出信号，并且有文艺来推波助澜。资产阶级右派的政治进攻，高潮在一九五七年五、六月；文艺界右派的“电影的锣鼓”敲起在年初，《知识分子的早春天气》发表在三月。右倾机会主义分子的政治进攻，高潮在庐山会议上；《海瑞骂皇帝》发表在会议的前夕。最近一次资产阶级的政治进攻，高潮在一九六一、特别是一九六二年；《海瑞罢官》、《李慧娘》、《谢瑶环》，写成、演出和发表在一九六○年末或一九六一年的年初和年中。这样一个时间表，不是清楚地说明了文艺敏锐地、能动地反映阶级斗争的规律性吗？
    所以，一方面在舞台上为被罢了官的“英雄”唱颂歌，另一方面在社会生活中被“罢”了“官”的右倾机会主义分子刮起一阵“翻案风”；一方面在舞台上大喊大叫要“退田”，另一方面在社会生活中刮起一阵“单干风”——这样两个方面的现象，大约同时在一九六一年前后的一段时期里出现，互相呼应，绝不可能是偶然的，彼此无关的事情。它们同是我国阶级斗争历史发展和当前变动的产物，同受一个阶级斗争起伏规律的支配，从社会思潮来说，前者是能动地反映后者，并且为后者服务的。
    （三）
    吴晗同志拿出来的第三条理由是，他写《海瑞罢官》的目的性，“在当时是不清楚的，糊涂的”，“完全是为古而古，为写戏而写戏”。
    这里，吴晗同志调转了笔锋，拣起了资产阶级的陈词滥调。可是，这块破烂的盾牌，又怎能帮助吴晗同志把问题的要害掩护起来呢？
    而且，我们记得，在写作和演出《海瑞罢官》的时候，吴晗同志的腔调跟现在是很不相同的。
    就在《海瑞罢官》这个剧本的序和前言里，吴晗同志明明白白地交代，他是反复考虑了剧本主题的“现实意义”，并且认为他写的海瑞是“值得我们今天学习”的③。
    当《海瑞罢官》开始上演，一些人称兄道弟地为他捧场的时候，吴晗同志踌躇满志，在答谢别人祝贺的公开信里，又清清楚楚地声明，历史剧“里面的历史人物决不是僵尸的复活，写这个人、演这个人，都要着眼于他或她的某个方面对于后一代的人们的启发作用”，“不是为了死人，而是为活人服务”，这是“不容有任何怀疑”的④。
    在谈历史剧的一系列文章里，吴晗同志也一再宣传，“历史剧的目的，是要今人学习”，“过去的某些时代精神有助于今天的需要”⑤，要“把死史料运用为活史料，密切结合当前需要”，“古为今用”⑥。
    在关于学习历史的许多文章和讲话里，吴晗同志更是反复地讲解：“学习历史不只是为了取得过去时代的知识和经验，更重要的是……为现实政治服务”⑦；“不是脱离政治的科学，而是政治性很强的科学”；“不是为死人服务，而是为活人服务，不是为了过去，而是为了今天和明天”⑧。
    吴晗同志还特别公开宣告过自己写文章的主张：“目的性要清楚”，“要有所为而作”，“无所‘为’的文章，尽管文理通顺，语气连贯，但是内容空洞，只能归入废话一栏，以不写为好”⑨。
    诸如此类，不胜枚举。
    请看，这些话说得何等斩钉截铁！那里是“一点也没有想起过古为今用的原则”！那里有丝毫“目的性不清楚”！又那里有片刻“脱离了政治、脱离了现实”！曾几何时，吴晗同志变了一副面孔。这是什么缘故呢？原来是时势不同了。在当时，吴晗同志认为气候适宜，所以当他用“古”为反社会主义的现实政治服务的时候，他是那样热心地宣传“古为今用”，生怕有些人不懂得它的现实用意；而到了今天，当这种现实政治的反社会主义实质被揭穿并且受到批判的时候，他觉得气候不对了，所以赶忙装出一副糊涂样子，说什么那时候他是“为古而古，为写戏而写戏”，生怕人们捉住它的现实用意，击中它的政治要害。可是，当日的吴晗同志在反驳今日的吴晗同志。我们究竟相信那一个吴晗同志才是呢？在百家争鸣中，我们欢迎严肃的自我批评，我们也欢迎严肃的自我辩护和反批评。可是为什么要给我们谎言呢？
    世界上从来没有为文艺的文艺、为学术的学术。文艺和学术总是从属于政治，以这种或那种方式为政治服务的。无产阶级的政治是为世界上绝大多数人服务的政治，所以，无产阶级的文艺和学术，从来不隐讳自己的政治目的。资产阶级的、反社会主义的政治是为极少数人服务而反对绝大多数人的，所以，为这种政治服务的文艺和学术，往往要向人们隐瞒自己的政治目的；在无产阶级专政的条件下，尤其是这样。思想战线的斗争历史告诉我们，当你听到有人高谈为文艺而文艺、为学术而学术等等的时候，你必须当心，这里面有鬼。吴晗同志“为古而古”、“为写戏而写戏”的辩词，又一次印证了人们的这一条政治经验。
    （四）
    最后，我们来看看吴晗同志拿出来的第四条理由，他说：他“二十多年来一直在党的教育、培养、关怀下，政治上的阶级立场是站稳了的”。
    “政治上的阶级立场”，不是什么抽象的东西，它是体现在人们的社会实践中，体现在人们的言论和行动中的，特别是在阶级斗争的大风大浪中来考验的。请问吴晗同志，从一九五九年到一九六一年，你写出和发表了从《海瑞骂皇帝》到《海瑞罢官》等为右倾机会主义分子张目的宣传文字，这是在政治上站稳了哪个阶级的立场呢？现在，你在《关于〈海瑞罢官〉的自我批评》中，不但不从政治上检查自己的错误，反而把它说成是响应党的号召的作品，这又是在政治上站稳了哪个阶级的立场呢？还有，在一九六一、一九六二年间，在学术界，你打出一面反马克思主义的大旗，向一九五八年以来的学术文化革命猖狂反扑，妄图扭转社会主义学术文化革命的车轮，使之走上资本主义、封建主义学术文化复辟的道路，这又是在政治上站稳了哪个阶级的立场呢？
    吴晗同志很以他的“二十多年”自诩。在这里，我们无意于评论吴晗同志二十多年来的政治历史。我们只想指出，二十多年来，革命在前进，从民主革命转变到社会主义革命，社会主义革命又一步一步地深入。随着革命的不断前进，革命者的队伍在不断扩大的同时，也不断发生重新分化和改组，这是革命深入的必然结果。能不能随着革命的前进，不断改造自己，跟上革命的步伐，这对每一个革命者都是极其严肃的问题。革命历史不能给任何人在政治上打包票，这只能取决于人们在革命进程中不断自我改造的自觉、决心与实践。没有思想改造的自觉，那么，他们头脑中的资产阶级世界观，他们头脑中的旧思想、旧传统、旧习惯，就一定要反映出来，一定要在政治问题和思想问题上用各种办法顽强地表现自己，一定要按照自己的面貌去改造世界。这样，他们就一定会在阶级斗争的这个关头或者那个关头同党、同社会主义、同革命的新发展发生深刻的冲突。民主革命时期党的同路人，在社会主义革命路程的这个站口或者那个站口同党分手，甚至走到同党对抗的方面，难道是少见的事情吗？昔日的左翼变成今日的右翼，难道是少见的事情吗？资产阶级特别希望寻找这样的人做他们的代言人，因为他们曾经是左翼，有政治资本和群众影响，能够起老右翼所不能起的作用。他们挂着左翼的招牌，实际上成了右翼拥戴的新首领，在资本主义势力和封建势力向社会主义的进攻中充当了急先锋。
    斯大林同志说过：“革命的威力也表现在它不对‘名人’打躬作揖，而要他们为它服务，如果他们不愿意向它学习，那就会把他们抛到九霄云外。”（《“有许多公牛围绕我”》全集第三卷第三七○页）
    彻底放下架子，向革命学习，向工农兵学习，向马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想学习，从政治立场、世界观到感情深处同资产阶级彻底决裂，这是一切不愿意被革命抛到九霄云外去的人们应当选择的唯一道路。
