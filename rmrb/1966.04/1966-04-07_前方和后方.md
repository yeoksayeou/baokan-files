    Walking into the small tool, fixture, and mold storage room of the Jinwei Hai Factory, one often hears the sounds of hammering and metal filing. What is going on? It turns out that the storekeeper, Xu Hongyuan, is not content with simply doing his job of storing tools. He has also learned a set of skills for overhauling, assembling, and processing, so as to deliver high-quality tools, fixtures, and molds to the front lines in a timely manner. Sometimes, he even takes the initiative to improve the molds, helping production workers improve product quality. Xu Hongyuan said, "As long as one has revolutionary aspirations, every position can be at the forefront." Although he is in the "rear," he does his work with remarkable success, constantly contributing to the "front line's" efforts to catch up with and surpass the advanced.
    Production is like battle, and all work in the rear is to support the front. Those whose work posts are in the rear should not leave their thinking in the rear but should breathe and fight alongside those at the front. Xu Hongyuan's task is to store tools, but he has greatly exceeded the scope of storage, overhauling, assembling, and processing tools. This shows that although his body is in the rear, his heart is at the front. To support the front, he creatively does his rear work.

    前方和后方
    走近卫海厂小小的工夹模具保管室，常常会听到敲敲打打和锉磨金属的声音。这是怎么回事？原来，保管员许洪源并不满足做好份内的保管工具的工作，他还学会了一套翻修、装配和加工的本领，把高质量的工夹模具及时送上前方。有时，他还主动改进模具，帮助生产工人提高产品质量。许洪源说：“只要有革命志气，每个岗位都能打头阵。”他人在“后方”，却把工作做得有声有色，时刻在为“前线”的赶超先进出力。
    生产如同战斗，后方的一切工作都是为了支援前方，工作岗位在后方的人，思想不应当留在后方，应当和前方的人同呼吸共战斗。许洪源的任务是保管工具，可是，他却大大越出了保管的范围，把工具翻修、装配、加工。这说明他身虽在后方，心却在前方，为了支援前方，他创造性地做后方工作。
