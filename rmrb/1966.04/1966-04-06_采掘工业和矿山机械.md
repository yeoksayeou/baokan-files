    Gold, silver, copper, iron, coal – some exist independently, like coal mines; others are mixed with other metals or non-metals, like iron ore and copper ore. We use machines to extract these minerals from the ground and select the useful minerals from them. This whole process is called the "Mining Industry."

    The mining industry is a precursor to various industries, both civilian and defense. It not only provides fuel, raw materials, and materials for the machine manufacturing industry, but also is indispensable for the building materials industry, chemical industry, light industry, and textile industry.

    The level of the mining industry, to a great extent, depends on the level of mechanization of mining equipment. After liberation, the Party and the government attached great importance to the development of the mining industry, vigorously improved the working conditions of miners, and actively developed mining machinery to equip mines. At present, China has mastered the design and manufacture of hundreds of types of mining machinery.

    The following is a brief introduction to the types of mining machinery used in each operation, according to the sequence of mining industry operations.

    Prospecting:
    This is the entire process of searching for ore, determining the nature of the ore, the depth, area, and direction of burial, the ore reserves, and the symbiotic minerals. This work mainly involves obtaining rock samples with geological drilling rigs and then analyzing them using some instruments.
    Development:
    This is the process of excavating passages from the surface to the ore deposit to facilitate mining. These passages are the so-called "vertical shafts," "inclined shafts," "inclined roadways," and "horizontal roadways," etc. The machinery used in this operation includes rock drills, rock grabbers, and rock loaders.

    Most open-pit mines require the removal of the top layer of topsoil and rock to expose the ore deposit to the surface before mining can begin. This part of the project is called stripping, and the machinery used includes drilling machines, excavators, electric locomotives, and dump trucks.

    Mining:
    In the mining industry, this is called "recovery," which means bringing the minerals back to the surface. Due to the complex distribution of underground rock formations and minerals, there are various types of mining machinery to adapt to them, such as various rock roadway combined tunneling machines, combined coal mining machines (units), and various loaders. To hoist the ore to the surface, there are also various hoisting and transporting machines, such as various single-rope hoists, multi-rope hoists, as well as winches, scraper conveyors, belt conveyors, and small mine cars that undertake short-distance transportation.

    Mineral Processing:
    Removing the impurities and stones contained in the ore is collectively called mineral processing. Mineral processing requires the use of crushers to crush the ore first, then use grinding machines to grind the ore into powder, and then use screening machines, classifiers, magnetic separators, flotation machines, etc. for grading and washing. Finally, it undergoes dewatering and drying through concentrators, filters, dehydrators, dryers, etc. to become concentrate powder, which is then smelted.

    In order to improve the quality of coal and increase the variety of coal, the coal mined from underground also needs to be sent to the coal preparation plant for selection, to remove impurities and gangue, and to screen into various particles. This process is called coal preparation. Some coal washing machines and coal preparation machines are specially designed and manufactured for the coal preparation industry. (Attached picture)

    采掘工业和矿山机械
    金、银、铜、铁、煤，有单独存在的，如象煤矿；有和其它金属或非金属混在一起的，如象铁矿石、铜矿石等。我们用机器把这些矿物从地下开采出来，并把有用的矿物从中挑选出来，这一整套作业过程，就叫做“采掘工业”。
    采掘工业是民用和国防等各种工业的先行工业。它不仅为机器制造工业提供燃料、原料和材料，而且建筑材料工业、化学工业、轻工业和纺织工业等都离不了它。
    而采掘工业的水平，在极大程度上又决定于矿山装备机械化的水平。解放后，党和政府十分重视采掘工业的发展，大力改善矿工的劳动条件，积极发展矿山机械装备矿山。目前我国已掌握了数百种矿山机械的设计与制造。
    下面按照采掘工业作业的次序，就各种作业用的矿山机械的类型作一简单的介绍。
    探矿：
    就是寻找矿石、确定矿石的性质、埋藏的深度、面积、走向、矿石的储藏量以及共生的矿物质等的全部工作。这部分工作主要是用地质钻探机取得岩石的标本后，利用一些仪器仪表进行分析。开　拓：
    就是从地面开凿通到矿床的通路，以便进行采矿。这些通路就是所谓“竖井”、“斜井”、“斜巷”和“平巷”等等。在这个作业中使用的机械有凿岩机、抓岩机和装岩机等。
    开采露天矿大多数都要把上面的一层表土和岩石挖掉，使矿床露出地面，然后进行开采。这部分工程叫做剥离，使用的机械有穿孔机、挖掘机和电机车、自翻车等。
    采矿：
    采掘工业上叫“回采”，就是将矿物采回到地面上的意思。由于地下岩层和矿物分布复杂，因而与其相适应的就有各式各样的采掘机械，如各种岩巷联合掘进机、联合采煤机（机组）、和各式各样的装载机等。要把矿石提升到地面上来，还有各种提升运输机械，如各种单绳提升机、多绳提升机，以及担负短距离搬运工作的绞车、刮板运输机、皮带运输机和小矿车等。
    选矿：
    把矿石里含的杂质和石头去掉，这个工作，统称为选矿。选矿需要用破碎机先把矿石压碎，然后用磨矿机把矿石磨成粉，再用筛分机、分级机、磁选机、浮选机等进行分级、洗选，最后经过浓缩机、过滤机、脱水机、干燥机等等进行脱水干燥成为精矿粉，再去冶炼。
    为了提高煤炭的质量和增加煤炭的品种，从井下采出的煤也需要送到选煤厂去挑选，选去杂质矸石，筛分成各种颗粒，这一过程就叫选煤。一些洗煤机、选煤机就是专为选煤工业而设计制造的。（附图片）
