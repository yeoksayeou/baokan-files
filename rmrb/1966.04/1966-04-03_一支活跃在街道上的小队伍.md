    The Youth Center is an important socialist education base. Before we established the Youth Center, some unemployed youth, due to lack of management and education, were seriously influenced by bourgeois ideology, and some developed some bad habits. After the Youth Center was established, they were all educated and slowly improved.

    When Sun Shugang first entered the "Home," he often fought, cursed, and satirized progressive classmates. After repeated education, especially after studying Chairman Mao's works and conducting class education on recalling bitterness and thinking about sweetness, he underwent a great transformation. His bad habits were corrected, and he could actively respond to the school's call and play a model leading role. He also took the initiative to help backward students correct their mistakes and shortcomings, and helped his neighbors. A young classmate's older brother was not at home and the house was cold, so Sun Shugang went to build a stove and plaster the walls for them. When a neighbor's husband was away, he fetched water for them every day. In mid-December last year, when the organization was assigning him a job, they asked for his opinion, and he said, "Wherever the Party needs me most is my aspiration." Soon, he honorably joined the Communist Youth League. Over the past two years, the Youth Center has successively absorbed 465 young people to participate in learning. Now 80 of them have settled in the countryside, and 277 have taken up industrial or other production jobs.

    Young people are not only educated and trained in skills at the "Home," but also are an active small team in our street work. They have assisted relevant departments in a lot of work. They fixed every Saturday afternoon as
  "Serve the People" time. On this day, all the students went out to fetch water, chop firewood, sweep snow, wipe glass, sweep the yard, and dismantle and wash bedding for the families of martyrs, military personnel, and educated youth who went to the countryside. The masses said, "These kids have really become diligent. It's all because the Youth Center is well-run!"

    They are even more active in street propaganda work. Every Wednesday afternoon is the political activity day for street residents and also the activity day for the "Red Five Members" of the Youth Center. The young people, according to their expertise, served as storytellers, newspaper readers, song teachers, young children's team instructors, and blackboard newspaper quotation members, to carry out activities in the streets. The 28 storytellers told 25 revolutionary stories in July last year, 155 times, with more than 21,700 listeners. The 22 newspaper readers read the newspaper 41 times, and the song teachers taught 11 revolutionary songs, with more than 800 residents participating in newspaper reading and singing activities. They also compiled and performed various entertainment programs based on the central work of the street and the good people and good deeds of street residents and classmates. Wherever the "Red Five Members" went, many people gathered and it immediately became lively.

    They also actively engaged in some social public welfare labor. They swept the streets and repaired toilets for residents; when the construction and installation cooperative had urgent tasks, they went to work as mason apprentices; when the granary needed to move grain, they went to transport grain; when the transportation company was too busy, they went to load and unload sand and white ash; and they also helped the house repair team repair doors and windows. The masses said: These young people are really capable, they go wherever they are needed.

    These young people who used to run around everywhere have now become powerful assistants in street work. Through the above activities, the Youth Center has taken root among the masses, and at the same time, young people have been educated and trained, and are growing up healthily day by day.

    一支活跃在街道上的小队伍
    青少年之家是一个重要的社会主义教育阵地。我们在建立青少年之家以前，有些未升学的青年，由于没人管理和教育，受资产阶级思想的影响比较严重，有的沾染了一些坏习气。办起了青少年之家以后，他们都受到了教育，也就慢慢变好了。
    孙树刚才入“家”时，经常打架骂人，讽刺进步同学。经过反复教育，特别是学习了毛主席著作和进行忆苦思甜的阶级教育以后，他有了很大的转变，坏毛病改掉了，还能积极响应学校的号召，能起模范带头作用。他还主动地帮助后进的学员改正错误和缺点，并且帮助左邻右舍。一个小同学的哥哥不在家，屋子冷，孙树刚就去给搭炉子、抹墙；邻居家里男人外出，他就每天去给挑水。去年十二月中旬，组织分配他工作的时候，征求他的意见，他说：“党最需要我去的地方，就是我的志愿。”不久，他光荣地加入了共青团。两年多来，青少年之家先后吸收了四百六十五名青少年参加学习。现在已有八十人去农村落了户，二百七十七人走上工业或其它生产岗位。
    青少年不仅在“家”里受到教育，练了本领，而且也是我们街道工作中一支活跃的小队伍。他们协助有关部门作了不少工作。他们固定每星期六下午为
  “为人民服务”的时间。这天，学员全部出动，给烈属军属和下乡知识青年家属挑水、劈柴、扫雪、擦玻璃、扫院子、拆洗被褥。群众说：“这帮孩子可真变勤快了，这都是青少年之家办得好啊！”
    他们在街道的宣传工作中更是活跃。每星期三午后，是街道居民的政治活动日，也是青少年之家“红五员”的活动日。青少年们根据自己的专长，分别担任了故事员、读报员、教歌员、幼儿队辅导员、板报语录员，到街道开展活动。二十八名故事员去年七月就讲了二十五个革命故事，一百五十五场次，听众有二万一千七百余人次。二十二名读报员读报四十一次，教歌员教唱了革命歌曲十一支，参加读报、学唱歌活动的居民有八百余人。他们还配合街道的中心工作以及街道居民和同学中的好人好事自编自演各种文娱节目。“红五员”走到那里，那里就聚拢许多群众，立时热闹起来。
    他们还积极地从事社会上的一些公益劳动。他们扫大街，给居民修厕所；建筑安装合作社有紧急任务时，他们去当泥瓦匠小工；粮库要调动粮食时，他们就去运粮食；运输公司忙不过来时，他们就去装卸砂子和白灰；还帮助房屋维修队修理门窗。群众说：这帮小青年真能干，那里需要就到那里。
    这些从前四处乱跑的青少年，如今已经成为街道工作中的有力助手。通过上述活动，使青少年之家在群众中生了根，同时也使青少年受到教育和锻炼，一天天健康地成长起来。
