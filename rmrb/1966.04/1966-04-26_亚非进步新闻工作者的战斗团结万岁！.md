    Long Live the Fighting Solidarity of Asian-African Progressive Journalists!
    The Fourth Plenary Meeting (Enlarged) of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association, held in Beijing, has victoriously concluded on April 24. This was a meeting that held high the banner of fighting against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, with a very clear distinction between who are the enemies and who are the friends. It was also a meeting filled with the spirit of unity and cooperation. This victorious meeting will undoubtedly play a significant role in further advancing the cause of Asian-African journalists' solidarity against imperialism. We Chinese journalists and the Chinese people warmly congratulate the success of the meeting.
    This meeting was the Secretariat meeting with the largest number of attendees and the broadest representation since the establishment of the Asian-African Journalists Association. Delegations from nineteen Asian-African countries and regions participated in this meeting. During the meeting, six more journalists' organizations were admitted. All this signifies the growing solidarity of Asian-African journalists in their anti-imperialist struggle and the continuously expanding influence of the Asian-African Journalists Association. More and more progressive journalists from Asian and African countries are closely uniting under the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism, held high by the Asian-African Journalists Association, and fighting for the common goal of burying imperialism. This is a powerful response to the imperialists, their lackeys, and accomplices who are single-mindedly trying to undermine the Asian-African Journalists Association.
    This enlarged meeting of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association was convened at a time when people all over the world are engaged in fierce struggles against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. Currently, the people of Asia, Africa, and the world are awakening as never before, revolutionary forces are growing stronger day by day, and revolutionary movements are developing in depth. The people of Asian and African countries urgently demand strengthened unity, further development of the struggle against imperialism and neo-colonialism headed by the United States, and a clear demarcation with the pseudo-revolutionaries who are actually acting as accomplices of imperialism, and a resolute struggle against their conspiracies to undermine the revolutionary cause of the people of various countries. This Secretariat meeting of the Asian-African Journalists Association fully reflects this high-spirited fighting spirit of Asian-African journalists and the Asian-African people, and has pushed the anti-imperialist solidarity movement of Asian-African journalists to a new level.
    The general report made by Djawoto, Secretary-General of the Asian-African Journalists Association, correctly analyzed the current world political situation, and clearly pointed out the direction, tasks, and prospects of the united struggle of Asian-African progressive journalists. The revolutionary principles revealed in the general report, which firmly oppose U.S. imperialism and its lackeys and resolutely refuse to compromise with any anti-people forces, were not only affirmed by the representatives in their discussions, but also embodied in a series of documents adopted by the meeting.
    Supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation became an important theme of this meeting. The heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people was regarded as a glorious example and source of inspiration for the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries. The "Resolution on the Vietnam Issue" adopted by the meeting expressed firm support for the just position of the Vietnamese people and called on journalists from Asian and African countries to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression to the end with practical actions.
    The meeting also adopted more than thirty other political resolutions, strongly condemning imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, for its crimes of aggression in various parts of the world, firmly supporting the struggle of the Asian-African people and the people of all countries against imperialism and neo-colonialism headed by the United States, and powerfully supporting Asian-African journalists in Asian and African countries who are suffering from the brutal persecution of imperialism and reactionaries. These resolutions reflect the growing fighting solidarity of Asian-African journalists and the Asian-African people in their common struggle.
    The representatives of various countries participating in the meeting expressed great anger at the criminal actions of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces. This is primarily because the Indonesian right-wing generals clique, colluding with U.S. imperialism, launched a counter-communist, anti-people, and anti-China frenzy after seizing state power, committing countless heinous fascist crimes. Anyone with a sense of justice cannot help but feel indignant. Moreover, while frantically suppressing the masses of the people, the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces extended their sinister hand to the Asian-African Journalists Association. They forced the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association out of Jakarta. Not content with this, they continued to launch vicious attacks and sabotage activities against the Secretariat. The actions of the Indonesian reactionaries cannot but make progressive journalists from Asian and African countries feel even more indignant. The enlarged meeting of the Secretariat not only fully supported the decision of the Secretariat to withdraw from Jakarta, but also unanimously passed a resolution severely condemning all the crimes committed by the Indonesian fascist regime, expressing firm support for the revolutionary cause of the Indonesian people, and firmly believing that "the Indonesian people's resistance movement, loyal to its long and arduous fighting tradition against colonialism and imperialism in the past, will undergo more training and gain more experience in the current test, and will surely become stronger and stronger and become a powerful force capable of changing the current situation." This strong voice issued by the meeting expressed the profound fighting friendship of the Asian-African people.
    It is particularly worth emphasizing that this enlarged meeting of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association fully promoted the spirit of democracy. The representatives of various countries participating in the meeting, based on the principle of equality, fully exchanged opinions on issues of common concern and reached genuine consensus. There was no baton, no voting machine, and no one imposed their will on others. The results of the meeting proved that this is conducive to promoting genuine unity on the basis of anti-imperialism. The democratic approach of this meeting stands in sharp contrast to the bad practices of some international organizations that are controlled by one party. We hope that the Asian-African Journalists Association can adhere to and continue to promote this good style in the future, and we also hope that this style can be extended to the Asian-African people's solidarity movement.
    The Chinese people and Chinese journalists wholeheartedly welcome the decision of the enlarged meeting of the Secretariat to temporarily locate the working place of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association in Beijing. This is a great trust of the Asian-African journalists in the Chinese people and Chinese journalists. We have always regarded supporting the Asian-African journalists and the Asian-African people's united anti-imperialist cause as our unshirkable internationalist obligation. We will never fail the trust and expectations of the broad masses of Asian-African journalists in us. The Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association can fully expect to receive the active support of the Chinese people and Chinese journalists in its future work.
    For the three years since its establishment, the Asian-African Journalists Association has always stood at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism and neo-colonialism, making great contributions to promoting the unity of Asian-African journalists and the Asian-African people, advancing the revolutionary cause of the Asian-African people, and developing the national progressive journalism of the two major continents of Asia and Africa. Therefore, imperialism, its lackeys, and accomplices, who extremely hate the Asian-African people's anti-imperialist struggle, have consistently adopted a hostile attitude towards the Asian-African Journalists Association. They are constantly plotting to undermine this fighting organization of Asian-African journalists. However, the Asian-African Journalists Association, which has grown up in the storm of the Asian-African people's anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle, cannot be destroyed by any imperialist decadent forces. On the contrary, it is becoming increasingly mature and stronger in struggle and testing. This plenary meeting of the Secretariat decided to hold the Second Asian-African Journalists Conference in Algiers within one year. We warmly support the convening of the Second Asian-African Journalists Conference and are determined to do our best to make this conference a success. We firmly believe that the upcoming Second Asian-African Journalists Conference will better promote the revolutionary spirit of the 1963 Jakarta Declaration, hold higher the banner of anti-imperialism and neo-colonialism, further promote the fighting solidarity of Asian-African journalists, and make greater contributions to the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the Asian-African people.

    亚非进步新闻工作者的战斗团结万岁！
    在北京举行的亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议（扩大），已于四月二十四日胜利闭幕。这是一个高举反对美帝国主义及其走狗的战斗旗帜的会议，谁是敌人，谁是朋友，界限十分鲜明。这也是一个充满着团结合作精神的会议。这个胜利的会议，对于进一步推进亚非新闻工作者团结反帝的事业，必将会产生巨大的作用。我们中国新闻工作者和中国人民，热烈祝贺会议的成功。
    这次会议，是亚非新闻工作者协会成立以来，出席的人数最多、代表性最广泛的一次书记处会议。有来自十九个亚非国家和地区的代表团参加了这次会议。在会议过程中，又有六个新闻工作者组织被接纳入会。这都标志着亚非新闻工作者反帝战斗团结的日益加强，标志着亚非新闻工作者协会影响的不断扩大。亚非各国越来越多的进步新闻工作者，在亚非新闻工作者协会高举的反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的旗帜下，紧密地团结起来，为埋葬帝国主义的共同目标而奋斗。这是对一心想破坏亚非新闻工作者协会的帝国主义及其走狗和帮凶们的有力回答。
    亚非新闻工作者协会书记处这次扩大会议，是在全世界人民正在同美帝国主义及其走狗进行剧烈大搏斗的时候召开的。目前，亚非和全世界人民正在空前觉醒，革命力量正在日益壮大，革命运动正在深入发展。亚非各国人民迫切要求加强团结，进一步开展反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争，并且要求同实际上充当帝国主义帮凶的假革命者划清界限，同他们破坏各国人民革命事业的阴谋进行坚决的斗争。这次亚非新闻工作者协会书记处会议，充分反映了亚非新闻工作者和亚非人民这种高昂的战斗精神，把亚非新闻工作者的反帝团结运动，推到了一个新的水平。
    亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多在会上所作的总报告，正确地分析了当前的世界政治形势，明确地指出了亚非进步新闻工作者团结斗争的方向、任务和前途。总报告中所揭示的坚决反对美帝国主义及其走狗、决不与任何反人民势力妥协的革命原则，不仅为代表们在讨论中所肯定，而且体现在会议通过的一系列文件中。
    支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争，成为这次会议的一个重要主题。越南人民的英勇斗争被看成为各国人民革命斗争的光辉的榜样和鼓舞的泉源。会议通过的“关于越南问题的决议”，表示坚决支持越南人民的正义立场，并号召亚非各国新闻工作者以实际行动来支援越南人民把反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争进行到底。
    会议还通过了三十多项其他的政治决议，强烈谴责帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义在世界各地的侵略罪行，坚决支持亚非人民和世界各国人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争，并且有力地声援亚非各国遭受帝国主义和反动派残酷迫害的亚非新闻工作者。这些决议，反映了亚非新闻工作者和亚非人民在共同斗争中日益增强的战斗团结。
    参加会议的各国代表对于印度尼西亚右派反动势力的罪恶行径表示极大的愤怒。这首先是因为，印度尼西亚右派将领集团与美帝国主义勾结，在夺取了国家政权之后，掀起了反共、反人民、反华的狂潮，犯下无数令人发指的法西斯罪行。任何一个有正义感的人都不能不义愤填膺。不但如此，印度尼西亚右派反动势力在疯狂镇压人民群众的同时，把罪恶的黑手伸向亚非新闻工作者协会。他们把亚非新闻工作者协会书记处逼出雅加达。这还不够，他们又继续对书记处进行恶毒的攻击和破坏活动。印度尼西亚反动派的所作所为，不能不使亚非各国进步的新闻工作者感到加倍的愤慨。书记处扩大会议，不仅完全支持书记处撤出雅加达的决定，而且一致通过决议，严厉谴责印度尼西亚法西斯政权犯下的一切罪行，对印度尼西亚人民的革命事业表示坚决的支持，坚信“印度尼西亚人民的抵抗运动忠于它过去反对殖民主义和帝国主义的艰巨斗争的悠久战斗传统，在目前的考验中经受更多的锻炼和得到更多的经验，必定会越来越壮大，并变成一支能够改变现在的局面的强大力量。”会议所发出的这种强烈的声音，表达了亚非人民深厚的战斗情谊。
    特别值得强调指出的是，这一次亚非新闻工作者协会书记处扩大会议，充分发扬民主的精神。参加会议的各国代表就大家共同关心的问题，根据平等的原则，经过充分交换意见，达成真正的一致。没有指挥棒，没有表决机器，谁也不把自己的意志强加于人。会议的结果证明，这样做有利于促进在反帝基础上的真正团结。这个会议的民主方式，同那些受一家操纵的某些国际组织的会议的恶劣做法，形成鲜明的对照。我们希望亚非新闻工作者协会今后能够坚持和继续发扬这种良好的作风，还希望这种作风能被推广到亚非人民团结运动中去。
    中国人民和中国新闻工作者衷心欢迎书记处扩大会议决定把亚非新闻工作者协会书记处的工作地点暂时设在北京。这是亚非新闻工作者对中国人民和中国新闻工作者的极大信任。我们一贯把支持亚非新闻工作者和亚非人民的团结反帝事业，看作是自己义不容辞的国际主义义务。我们决不会辜负广大亚非新闻工作者对我们的信任和期望。亚非新闻工作者协会书记处在今后的工作当中，完全可以指望得到中国人民和中国新闻工作者积极的支持。
    亚非新闻工作者协会成立三年来，一直站在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义斗争的前列，为促进亚非新闻工作者和亚非人民的团结，推进亚非人民革命事业以及发展亚非两大洲民族进步新闻事业方面，作出了巨大的贡献。因此，极端痛恨亚非人民反帝斗争的帝国主义及其走狗和帮凶，对于亚非新闻工作者协会一贯采取仇视的态度。他们无时无刻不在阴谋破坏亚非新闻工作者的这一战斗组织。然而，在亚非人民反帝革命斗争风暴中锻炼成长起来的亚非新闻工作者协会，是任何帝国主义腐朽势力所破坏不了的。相反，它却在斗争和考验中，日益成熟和坚强。这次书记处全体会议决定在一年内在阿尔及尔召开第二次亚非新闻工作者会议。我们热烈支持第二次亚非新闻工作者会议的召开，并决心为开好这次会议竭尽自己的努力。我们深信，即将举行的第二次亚非新闻工作者会议，将更好地发扬一九六三年《雅加达宣言》的革命精神，更高地举起反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的旗帜，进一步促进亚非新闻工作者的战斗团结，为亚非人民的反帝革命斗争作出更大的贡献。（附图片）
