Edition: 5

Editor's Note: Since the discussion of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" began, newspapers and periodicals across the country have published many articles exposing and criticizing Comrade Wu Han's political errors. These articles point out that Comrade Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and other articles related to Hai Rui wholeheartedly supported right-leaning opportunism. The theme of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is to sympathize with and praise the right-leaning opportunists who were "dismissed" from "office," and to encourage them to "try again after failure." This play advocates "returning land" and "redressing unjust verdicts," inciting "the wind of individual farming" and "the wind of reversing verdicts." "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is a major poisonous weed that opposes the Party, opposes the people, and opposes socialism. In addition to what this newspaper has already published, we now excerpt relevant arguments from some articles on this aspect.

Comrade Wu Han Fully Supports Right-Leaning Opportunism

Cheering and Encouraging Right-Leaning Opportunists

From 1959 to 1961, Comrade Wu Han promoted the so-called "Hai Rui" spirit with fervor. What exactly was his intention?

In his "Self-Criticism on 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'," Comrade Wu Han arranged his articles about Hai Rui in chronological order of writing. The purpose of his arrangement was to avoid Comrade Yao Wenyuan's political criticism, which said his "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was written in 1960 and had nothing to do with the "wind of individual farming." However, he overreached himself; intending to cover his ears, he exposed his backside. Comrade Wu Han linked his "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" with the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held in Lushan, Jiangxi, in August 1959; this immediately revealed the "secret."

At the Lushan Conference, right-leaning opportunists called themselves Hai Rui, viciously attacking our Party and socialism; after the Lushan Conference, we dismissed right-leaning opportunists from office. This was the political situation at the time. On the eve of the Lushan Conference, Comrade Wu Han distorted Hai Rui's memorial to the emperor and wrote "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor"; after the Lushan Conference, he painstakingly spent a year distorting history to write "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office." Comrade Wu Han himself said that historical figures in history and historical dramas are "by no means resurrections of corpses" but serve the living; how do they serve the living? The answer is: "Writing about this person and acting as this person should focus on a certain aspect of him or her that inspires later generations." Yes, before the Lushan Conference, Comrade Wu Han focused on Hai Rui's scolding the emperor; his intention was to cheer for the right-leaning opportunists who were attacking the Party, like the "rapid wind" played by the orchestra before the "general" appeared in old operas. After the Lushan Conference, he focused on Hai Rui's "losing his office, but not yielding, not being discouraged," not slinking away; obviously, this was to cheer and encourage the right-leaning opportunists who had been dismissed from office, to encourage them to "try again after failure," and even hoping that "Hai Rui" would one day "return to office and reorganize the discipline" (see the script of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office")!

Using "Speaking for the People" to Whitewash Right-Leaning Opportunists

During 1959 and 1960, when our country encountered severe natural disasters and temporary economic difficulties arose, right-leaning opportunists became very active. They completely disregarded objective factors and gloated over the Party, which was leading the mass movement. On June 16, 1959, Comrade Wu Han threw out his "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor," using the past to satirize the present, coordinating with the offensive of the right-leaning opportunists. In this article, he insidiously said that "the people want to scold the emperor but cannot," and "it is a pleasure when someone actually scolds him"; he also said that "Hai Rui scolds the emperor, and those who sympathize with and support him are everywhere, and his reputation is growing." What did Comrade Wu Han say these things for? Can it be said that he was not using the past to scold the present, that he was not applauding and supporting the anti-Party activities of the right-leaning opportunists?

Right-leaning opportunists attacked the Party, which was leading the mass movement, under the guise of "speaking for the people" and defending the interests of farmers, posing as "protectors" of farmers' interests and dressing themselves up as "saviors" of the farmers. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party tore off the "speaking for the people" mask of the right-leaning opportunists, exposing their anti-Party features. At this time, Comrade Wu Han became anxious and quickly made a big deal in "On Hai Rui" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," fabricating a tall image of Hai Rui and beautifying the so-called "hero" who "speaks for the people." He said that Hai Rui "stood on the side of the farmers"; he "always thought of the people and sought their interests in everything he did"; his "actions were beneficial to the farmers, especially the poor and middle peasants"; for the sake of the farmers' interests, he "bravely threw his whole life into battle." Comrade Wu Han's meticulous portrayal of Hai Rui was nothing more than to dress the right-leaning opportunists in Hai Rui's clothes, using Hai Rui to whitewash the right-leaning opportunists, and to encourage people to applaud the anti-Party activities of the right-leaning opportunists.

(Ma Zemin, Wang Ruisheng: "'Hai Rui' is Comrade Wu Han's Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Political Tool," see "Guangming Daily," January 29, 1966)

A Specimen Provided to Right-Leaning Opportunists

In his "self-criticism," Comrade Wu Han tried his best to boast about the article "On Hai Rui," saying that it "opposed right-leaning opportunism and opposed counterfeiting and distorting Hai Rui." Why did Comrade Wu Han want to bring up the article "On Hai Rui" in his self-criticism on "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office"? It was because he said that his "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" "was written on the basis of 'On Hai Rui'." Since my Wu Han's motivation for writing "On Hai Rui" was not bad, the motivation for writing "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was of course not bad either.

Then, let's see what things were heavily rendered and promoted in "On Hai Rui":

Hai Rui is "a small official who is not afraid of big officials, dares to stand up to big officials, and dares to speak up for the people"; he "protected the poor," "stood on the side of the farmers," and "was the savior of the people who were suppressed, bullied, and wronged at that time";

Hai Rui "is a great man, a true man from ancient times"; he was pained by "nowadays, those who treat the country only use licorice root, and those who deal with the world only use two words: 'good old boys'";

Hai Rui said, "What career can be accomplished in such a world"; "The cause of the people's poverty is multifaceted, but the biggest harm is that officials are not the right people";

Hai Rui "intends to benefit the people," "cries bitterly for the people," "sighs long for the people";

Hai Rui "denounced the social atmosphere at that time," "opposed bad people and bad deeds, unyielding, never discouraged, bravely threw his whole life into battle"; he "had been attacked, squeezed out, insulted, imprisoned, and lost his office," but he "is a great man of the time."

We want to ask Comrade Wu Han: Today, the people of the whole country have long become the masters of the country under the leadership of the Communist Party. Whom are you calling on to learn from Hai Rui to "speak up for the people"? Whom are you calling on to learn from Hai Rui to be "the savior of the people who are suppressed, bullied, and wronged"? Who are "the people who are suppressed, bullied, and wronged"? Whom are you calling on to learn from Hai Rui to "throw his whole life into battle," not afraid of being imprisoned and losing his office? Obviously, Comrade Wu Han's real intention in writing "On Hai Rui" was to use Hai Rui's body to provide the right-leaning opportunists with the spiritual power to oppose the Party and oppose socialism, and to encourage them to rise up to carry out anti-Party and anti-socialist activities.

Obviously, the creative intention of "On Hai Rui" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and their purpose of "serving the living" are the same. Both are permeated with dissatisfaction with our socialist reality, revealing his dark psychology; both are cheering for the right-leaning opportunists and singing praises for them.

(Wu Wenzhi: "Political Problems Cannot Be Avoided with Such Self-Criticism," see "Guangming Daily," January 13, 1966)

Encouraging the "Fighting Spirit" of Right-Leaning Opportunists

At the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, our Party launched a powerful counterattack against the right-leaning opportunists. Shortly after the meeting, Comrade Wu Han published "On Hai Rui," talking about Hai Rui's thought of "making decisions for the people," vigorously praising "small officials who dare to stand up to big officials, small officials who dare to speak up for the people," talking about "the spirit of unyielding struggle," and saying: "These qualities are what we need to learn and promote today." The Hai Rui spirit promoted by Comrade Wu Han did play a role in praising and encouraging the right-leaning opportunists at that time.

Immediately afterwards, at the end of 1959, he "broke out of the door" and wrote the historical drama "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office." Why "break out of the door"? This is because Comrade Wu Han saw that "the role of drama is far beyond books," so he wanted to occupy the stage to make the "good virtues" of the ancients "deeply rooted in the hearts of the people" (see Wu Han's "Further Discussion on Historical Drama"). The emergence of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was by no means "for the sake of the ancients, for the sake of writing a play" as Comrade Wu Han himself said, but had its political purpose. During this period, it was when the right-leaning opportunists were seen through by the people, criticized to the point of being covered in dirt, and dismissed from "office." In Comrade Wu Han's view, the right-leaning opportunists were dismissed from "office" because they "spoke for the people," so he sympathized with them, complained for them, and also encouraged them to "not be subdued by the powerful, not be frightened by failure, try again after failure," hoping that the right-leaning opportunists would one day "return to office and reorganize the discipline."

(Lu Wenhui, Wang Yue: "For Whom is Comrade Wu Han Speaking," see "Liaoning Daily," March 10, 1966)

The Reactionary Political Motives Cannot Be Concealed

Comrade Wu Han introduced the writing time of his relevant articles, thinking that "On Hai Rui" was written after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, in response to the Party's call to "oppose right-leaning opportunism and oppose counterfeiting and distorting Hai Rui"; he also said that all the articles "were written before 1960," indicating that his "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" had nothing to do with the "wind of individual farming" and "wind of reversing verdicts."

Even in terms of the writing time introduced by Comrade Wu Han, it is not in line with the real situation. The fact is that, in addition to "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" published before the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, "Hai Rui's Story" was published in "New Observer" published on July 1, 1959; "Honest Official Hai Rui" was published in "Beijing Daily" on July 23, 1959. These three articles praising Hai Rui were all written before the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, and obviously not for the purpose of opposing right-leaning opportunism. And "On Hai Rui" was written on the basis of the above three articles, and its political views and historical views are completely consistent with the above three articles, so please ask: Why did the writing motivation of this article suddenly become anti-right-leaning opportunism?

Due to several consecutive years of natural disasters, China's economy encountered temporary difficulties, imperialism, reactionaries of various countries, and modern revisionism repeatedly launched anti-China climaxes, and domestic class enemies thought they had an opportunity and launched another attack on socialism, vigorously advocating "the wind of individual farming" and "the wind of reversing verdicts," and spreading feudalism, the bourgeoisie, and revisionist things in the ideological field. It was in these years that Comrade Wu Han wrote articles and plays, repeatedly praising Hai Rui, and also enthusiastically praising Hai Rui's "returning land" and "redressing unjust verdicts," enthusiastically praising Hai Rui's "strong will not to be subdued by the powerful, not to be frightened by failure, and to try again after failure." Isn't this advocating for the landlord class and the bourgeoisie to demand the restoration of the individual economy and the restoration of capitalist restoration activities? Isn't it cheering for the failed anti-Party and anti-socialist elements? The fact is the fact, and the political motivation for creating "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" cannot be concealed.

Calling Souls for Right-Leaning Opportunists Who Were "Dismissed" from "Office"

A "Hero" Image Shaped for Right-Leaning Opportunists

When the right-leaning opportunists suffered resolute struggle from the Party and the people and were defeated miserably, Comrade Wu Han gave them spiritual comfort and support, asking them to be "broad-minded" even if they were dismissed from office, saying that "even if they lose their office and are not understood, their pure name will last forever." In the early drafts of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," there was also a sentence: "In this era, the better the official, the more likely he is to lose his office." In "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," Comrade Wu Han vented. He was extremely dissatisfied with the Party and the people's struggle against right-leaning opportunism, thinking that they were "good officials," complaining for their "dismissal," and fighting "injustice." "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is not only singing praises for the right-leaning opportunists who were despised by the people and "dismissed" from office, but also encouraging them to "try again after failure," waiting for the day when they "return to office and reorganize the discipline," that is, to ask them to go to the end on the road of anti-Party and anti-socialism. "Hai Rui" is really a "hero" image of a right-leaning opportunist who is stubbornly to the end.

The so-called "returning land," "eliminating tyrants," and "dismissing officials" are essentially different aspects of the same problem in real life, and the core lies in "dismissing officials." The right-leaning opportunists clamored that the people's communes "were established too early and badly managed," that is, to "return land." They attacked one point, ignoring the rest, and described our great cause and our cadre team as "a black mass," so they clamored to "eliminate tyrants," "eliminate harm and first eliminate the wolves in power." The "returning land" and "eliminating tyrants" offensives of the anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist "hero" failed and were dismissed, but they still fantasized about making a comeback. This is the true meaning of "dismissing officials." The fact is very clear that Comrade Wu Han is precisely taking over the weapons in the hands of the right-leaning opportunists, polishing and shining them, and using them to oppose the Party and oppose socialism. This is the black line that runs through from "On Hai Rui" to "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office." Isn't Comrade Wu Han now raising the banner of "opposing right-leaning opportunism" to cover up the truth?

History is always ruthless to all those who are unwilling to join the revolutionary tide and take the inevitable path of history. Comrade Wu Han entered socialist society from the period of the democratic revolution, but his mind is still filled with many dirty things of the exploiting classes, and he根本不knows what proletarian ideology is, what communism is, and what the Party is. Therefore, when his incompletely transformed bourgeois stand and worldview increasingly conflicted with the in-depth development of the socialist revolution, in a new and fierce class struggle, he stood on the side of the class enemies who opposed socialism and attacked socialism, "sitting on the same bench" with the right-leaning opportunists, and "sitting on the same bench" with the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements.

(Cheng Yu: "For Whom is Singing Praises?" see "Beijing Daily," January 18, 1966)

Complaining for the Right-Leaning Opportunists Who Were "Dismissed" from "Office"

In order to cover up his motives, Comrade Wu Han tried his best to separate motives and effects. At the beginning of his article, he listed a timeline of writing from "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" to "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office"; we can understand this intention, which is to try to defend with the writing time and theme that "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" has nothing to do with the "wind of individual farming" and "wind of reversing verdicts." It would be fine if we didn't look at the writing time of the article. Once we look at the writing time of the article, the truth will be revealed to the world, and it will just expose the political motives of Comrade Wu Han's writing. In June 1959, just on the eve of the Lushan Conference, the right-leaning opportunists were wantonly attacking the Party, smearing the three red flags, and insulting the mass movement. And at this time, Comrade Wu Han wrote "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor," vigorously praising an abstract courage and boldness to "scold the emperor." May I ask, choosing this time to write such an article, isn't it closely echoing the anti-Party and anti-socialist activities of the right-leaning opportunists? In September 1959, after the Lushan Conference, the right-leaning opportunists were countered by the Party and the people, their anti-Party faces were completely exposed, and they were completely isolated. At this time, Comrade Wu Han hurriedly wrote "On Hai Rui," vigorously promoting "speaking for the people" and abstract "unyielding spirit." According to him, this was to "oppose right-leaning opportunism." But in our opinion, things are definitely not like this, and on the contrary, the intention is clearly to cheer for the right-leaning opportunists and ask them to resist the Party and the people to the end. At the end of 1959, the right-leaning opportunists suffered a complete defeat. At this time, Comrade Wu Han started to write "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" on the basis of "On Hai Rui." The theme of this play, according to Comrade Wu Han, is not returning land, but eliminating tyrants. However, in our opinion, the theme of this play is "dismissing officials," which expresses infinite and deep sympathy for those anti-Party and anti-people "heroes" who claim to "speak for the people" and are dismissed from office, complaining for them and giving them ideas. Like Hai Rui, even if they are dismissed from office, they will never give up and cannot leave in a slump.

What does such a timeline and the theme of these articles and plays illustrate? It tells us that Comrade Wu Han is using Hai Rui's ghost to sympathize with, complain for, complain for injustice, make plans for, and support the right-leaning opportunists and all anti-socialist ghosts and monsters.

(Shi Shaobin: "Comments on Several Issues in 'Self-Criticism on "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office"''", see "Guangming Daily," January 9, 1966)

Breaking Out of the Door to Support "Heroes" Who Are "Not Afraid of Losing Their Office"

Comrade Wu Han published "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" in 1959, and some people praised it greatly. We believe that the emergence of this situation is by no means accidental.

Everyone remembers that from 1959 to 1962, when China's economy encountered temporary difficulties, imperialism, reactionaries of various countries, and modern revisionism repeatedly launched anti-China climaxes, domestic class enemies launched a rampant attack on socialism again. In June 1959, just on the eve of the Lushan Conference, right-leaning opportunists launched a rampant attack on the Party Central Committee, opposing the general line and insulting the mass movement. It was at this time that Comrade Wu Han threw out his "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor," praising Hai Rui's "dauntless" spirit of scolding the emperor, saying that Hai Rui "scolded" Jiajing for "every family being so poor that they are clean and have no money to use," which was "scolding very happily." Is this a coincidence or something that was done with a purpose? At the end of 1959, when the right-leaning opportunists suffered a complete defeat and some people were dismissed from office, Comrade Wu Han did not hesitate to "break out of the door" and hurriedly wrote his new historical drama "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," depicting Hai Rui as a "hero" who "speaks for the people" and is "not afraid of losing his office." Isn't all this coordinating with the rampant attack of the right-leaning opportunists on the Party and socialism? What other explanation can be given besides this?

(Wang Xizeng, Yang Shoukan: "Why Praise ?" see "Beijing Daily," January 14, 1966)

Encouraging Right-Leaning Opportunists to Make a Comeback

From 1959 to 1961, it was the time when China suffered three consecutive years of extraordinary natural disasters, and our socialist construction encountered temporary difficulties. At this time, the international modern revisionist group colluded with imperialism and reactionaries of various countries to stage an anti-China chorus. Domestically, a small handful of ghosts and monsters were about to move, setting off an anti-socialist adverse current. Right-leaning opportunists put up the banner of "for the interests of the people," put on the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, and launched an attack on the Party and socialism, attacking the three red flags. Their attack was resolutely countered by the broad masses of people who insisted on taking the socialist road.

Not sooner or later, Comrade Wu Han wrote "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" at this time. In the preface to "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," he said: "This play focuses on Hai Rui's uprightness, not being subdued by the powerful, not being frightened by failure, and having a strong will to try again after failure... Hai Rui lost his office, but he did not yield or lose heart." Indeed, in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," Comrade Wu Han beautified and praised a loyal servant who stood on the position of the feudal ruling class and served to maintain the long-term interests of the ruling class, as a heroic image who "stood on the side of the farmers" and "fought for the interests of the farmers" and was therefore "dismissed" from office. Why is this? In his article "Some Issues Concerning Historical Drama," he introduced his experience in writing "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and said: "Writing about this person, acting as this person... is not for the dead but for the living." Serving what kind of living people? To put it bluntly, it is to cheer for the right-leaning opportunists who were falsely representing the interests of the farmers at that time and clamoring for "individual farming" and "reversing unjust verdicts," to encourage them to lose their office, "not yield, not lose heart," "try again after failure," and "one day return to office and reorganize the discipline" to make a comeback. Comrade Wu Han, through the beautification and praise of Hai Rui, pinned his sympathy on the right-leaning opportunists and vented his deep dissatisfaction with socialism. From the social effect after the performance and publication of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," this is also fully illustrated.

In his "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," Comrade Wu Han attacked today's socialism in the name of Hai Rui. Therefore, we say: It is a big poisonous weed!

(Yang Guangmei: "What Exactly is Promoting?" see "Yunnan Daily," February 22, 1966)

Fanning the Flames for "Individual Farming" and "Reversing Verdicts"

Shouting Loudly for "Returning Land" and "Redressing Unjust Verdicts"

Comrade Wu Han not only does not admit the political errors of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" in his "self-criticism," but instead says that it was to "oppose right-leaning opportunism." However, the facts cannot be denied.

From 1959 to 1961, the domestic and international class struggle situation was extremely sharp and complex. Internationally, American imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries launched an anti-China chorus. Domestically, first, the right-leaning opportunists came out to oppose the Party's leadership, attacking the three red flags, saying that "the people's communes were established too early and badly managed." Then, a "wind of individual farming" and "wind of reversing verdicts" blew up in society, advocating to divide the land of the communes to individuals, implement "contracting production to households," and demand to redress the "unjust verdicts" for landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. As a revolutionary literary and art worker, one should pick up the literary and art weapons, strike the enemy, eliminate the enemy, point the finger at capitalist and feudal forces, promote proletarian ideology, and destroy bourgeois and landlord class ideology. Comrade Wu Han not only did not do this, but instead "broke out of the door" and wrote "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," adding fuel to the fire. Our people raised their arms and shouted: Long live the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's communes! "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" expresses: Long live honest officials, law, and feudalism! (Hong Alan: "The blue sky master avenges the people, and the dukes will last for generations.") Through Hai Rui's mouth, he sang loudly: "The south of the Yangtze River is in distress and misery, it will not last long if the occupied land is not returned," "Unjust verdicts must be redressed, and the people can only be at peace if the land is returned." The author also portrayed Hai Rui as a "hero" who specializes in "returning land" and "redressing unjust verdicts" and "speaks for the people," who is "not afraid of death," and praised him in every way. In the proletarian dictatorship socialist country, the broad masses of peasants have long overthrown the enemy on their heads under the leadership of the Party, avenged their revenge, redressed their grievances, and firmly embarked on the socialist road. Whom are such descriptions in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" speaking for, serving, and benefiting? Isn't it very clear?

(Li Yanzhu: "Spreading the Fog of History and Singing the Anti-Tune of the Times," see "Literary Gazette," 1966, Issue 1)

Inciting Ghosts and Monsters to Stir Up Trouble

From the early days of liberation to 1958, Comrade Wu Han was unusually silent in the successive ideological struggles, and even in the struggle to criticize Hu Shih's thought, which had a special relationship with him, he did not speak. However, from 1959, Comrade Wu Han suddenly began to be active, "writing a lot and writing specially." From "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "On Hai Rui" to "breaking out of the door" and writing "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," he wrote nearly 150 articles of various sizes in three years. What made Comrade Wu Han so "uncomfortable" that he "had to write"? What did he write? He focused on describing: "Local officials are violent and the people are poor, like wolves and tigers in the empty fields," "Unjust verdicts must be redressed, and the people can only be at peace if the land is returned." Then, he picked up a tattered magic weapon from the arsenal of feudal culture and sacrificed it. This is "making decisions for the people," encouraging people to "sue." "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is Comrade Wu Han's declaration promoting "suing is also a low-level form of class struggle." Comrade Wu Han's article is a fire that fueled the ghosts and monsters in society at that time to stir up the "wind of reversing verdicts." This is exactly the case. After the script of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was published, the family of a special agent in Shanghai submitted a "petition" requesting to "redress unjust verdicts," which openly wrote: "In the present world, unless Hai Rui is reborn, he can surpass the snow, otherwise he will be buried here." Isn't this the realistic political significance of Comrade Wu Han's new theory of "suing"? If Comrade Wu Han does not agree with our analysis, we hope that he can explain his views more clearly and how to understand this "new" theory.

(Luo Siding: "On 'Suing'," see "Wenhui Daily," April 1, 1966)

Clearing the Way for Capitalist Restoration

Comrade Wu Han wrote a lot about "returning land" in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," promoting that in feudal society, peasants "have land and do not worry about clothing and food, and good times are in sight," and promoted it as a paradise and ideal life for peasants. What does this mean? Not to mention that in history, no exploiting class has ever automatically "returned" land to the peasants, but can the peasants really live a good life even if they have land? Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the peasants of our country, through the land reform movement, became the masters of the land for the first time. However, if the broad masses of peasants only stay on dividing the land and do not further implement socialist transformation and take the road of collectivization and people's communes, the broad masses of peasants in our country still cannot fundamentally get rid of poverty and backwardness, and maintaining the small-scale peasant private economy will also be conducive to the resurgence of feudal and capitalist forces. Therefore, advocating that peasants have a good life if they have land in the socialist revolution stage is by no means speaking for the peasants, but is precisely violating the fundamental interests of the peasants and serving the anti-socialist capitalist restoration fantasies. And advocating this kind of proposition in the situation of the individual farming wind around 1961 is an outrageous attack on socialism.

A Rampant Attack on the Party, the People, and Socialism

Insisting on the Bourgeois Stand and Opposing the Socialist Revolution

In our country, from 1959 to 1962, the class struggle was very fierce. It was at this time that Comrade Wu Han "broke out of the door," not only through the new historical drama "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," but also through essays, academic papers, historical stories, etc., prominently praising Hai Rui's so-called "good virtues" and "fighting spirit"; it was at this time that he prominently promoted feudal morality, wanting to "use the ancient for the present," "transfer it to today," and "apply it to today"; it was at this time that he prominently attacked Marxism, maintained the emperors, generals, and ministers in history, and opposed "being right about the present and wrong about the past" ("Under the Lamp Collection," page 65); it was at this time that he "had bones stuck in his throat" ("Learning Collection," page 273) and had to "write it out," etc. Are all these accidental? No, this is a reflection of class struggle. Chairman Mao said: "The bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie, their ideology must be reflected. They must stubbornly express themselves in political and ideological issues in various ways." ("On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People") The key to Comrade Wu Han's "breaking out of the door" and "persisting to the end" lies here.

Are all these caused by "confusion" with "unclear" purpose? Is it caused by "being ancient for the sake of being ancient"? Of course not. Comrade Wu Han "broke out of the door" to create this new historical drama "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" consciously, purposefully, and with a plan to speak for the right-leaning opportunists and oppose the socialist revolution. Chairman Mao said: "The proletariat wants to transform the world according to its own worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to transform the world according to its own worldview." (Ibid.) This is the essence of the problem.

(Wu Chuanqi: "What Did Comrade Wu Han 'Break Out of the Door' For?" see "Guangming Daily," January 19, 1966)

Fantasizing About Demolishing the Socialist Stage and Taking the Capitalist Road

Comrade Wu Han tried his best to make people believe that even if there were mistakes in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," it was only an academic issue, not a political issue. This is completely self-deception and deception! Those who stand on the position of the feudal landlord class and the bourgeoisie and are dissatisfied with the Party and socialism, although they also write articles in the academic field, what they do is to use academics as a protective color to oppose Marxism-Leninism, oppose Mao Zedong Thought, and attack the Party and socialism. This is of course not an academic issue, but a political issue.

This is him opposing Mao Zedong Thought from the field of history, and then expanding the position, fanning the flames, and demolishing the socialist stage more blatantly. May I ask Comrade Wu Han: In those years of great class struggle, you were so enthusiastic and came up with such a set of anti-Marxist-Leninist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought, and anti-socialist things, is it an academic issue? Can it be said that it is not a political issue?

Comrade Wu Han said that he "deviated from politics and deviated from reality." This is completely false. From Comrade Wu Han's consistent activities in these years, he not only did not deviate from politics and did not deviate from reality, but was a person with a strong political sense and knew what political struggle was all about. However, it needs to be explained here that what he is engaged in is bourgeois politics, not proletarian politics.

This is a Serious Class Struggle

Around 1961, the international community saw the emergence of the modern revisionist group headed by Khrushchev, who did everything possible to beautify American imperialism, saying that American monopoly groups also had "wise" factions, and promoted the "three harmonies" capitulationist line; domestic class enemies of all kinds took the opportunity to stir up trouble, and they took advantage of the temporary economic difficulties in our country due to natural disasters and attempted to restore the old order. Comrade Wu Han chose this opportunity to write and write a lot about Hai Rui in a planned and purposeful manner, to talk about and talk about Hai Rui a lot, saying that Hai Rui is a great "honest official," and should be affirmed and praised, what Hai Rui is "the savior of the people who are suppressed, bullied, and wronged," what Hai Rui is a "good official" in the eyes of the people, and is worthy of research and learning. Isn't it obvious what people this meets the needs of?

We must absolutely not fall for Comrade Wu Han's theory of class reconciliation, and we must draw a clear line with him and expose his anti-socialist face of "using the past to satirize the present" in broad daylight.

"Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is by no means simply an academic issue, but a major political issue. It is a reflection of the class struggle on the political and economic fronts, and a serious class struggle in the ideological field. Comrade Wu Han hopes that our working class can follow Hai Rui and cheer for the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements who have lost

### 吴晗同志写《海瑞罢官》的政治目的是什么？

    吴晗同志写《海瑞罢官》的政治目的是什么？
    编者按：自《海瑞罢官》的讨论开展以来，全国各地报刊发表了许多文章，对吴晗同志《海瑞罢官》的政治错误进行了揭露和批判。这些文章指出：吴晗同志写的《海瑞罢官》及其他有关海瑞的文章，都是全心全力支持右倾机会主义的。《海瑞罢官》的主题思想是同情、赞扬被“罢”了“官”的右倾机会主义分子，激励他们“失败了再干”；这出戏鼓吹“退田”、“平冤狱”，煽动“单干风”、“翻案风”。《海瑞罢官》是一株反党、反人民、反社会主义的大毒草。除本报已经发表的以外，现将一些文章有关这方面的论点摘编于后。
    吴晗同志全力支持右倾机会主义
    为右倾机会主义者助威、鼓气
    从一九五九年到一九六一年这个期间，吴晗同志宣扬所谓“海瑞”精神，达到了狂热的程度。其意图究竟是什么呢？
    吴晗同志在《关于〈海瑞罢官〉的自我批评》中，把他关于海瑞的文章，按照写作时间排了一个队。他排这个队的目的，是为了避开姚文元同志对他的政治批评，说他的《海瑞罢官》写于一九六○年，跟“单干风”无关。然而弄巧反拙，本想掩护耳朵，却露出了屁股。吴晗同志把他的《海瑞骂皇帝》和《海瑞罢官》，跟一九五九年八月在江西庐山举行的中国共产党八届八中全会联系了起来；这一下子泄露了“天机”。
    在庐山会议上，右倾机会主义者自称海瑞，恶毒地攻击我们的党，攻击社会主义；庐山会议之后，我们罢了右倾机会主义分子的官。这就是当时的政治。庐山会议前夕，吴晗同志歪曲海瑞上疏，写了《海瑞骂皇帝》；庐山会议之后，又煞费苦心地花了一年的时间，歪曲历史写了《海瑞罢官》。吴晗同志自己说：历史和历史剧“里面的历史人物决不是僵尸的复活”，而是为活人服务；怎么为活人服务？答曰：“写这个人、演这个人，都要着眼于他或她的某个方面对于后一代的人们的启发作用”。是的，在庐山会议之前，吴晗同志着眼于海瑞的，是骂皇帝；其意图就是给向党进攻的右倾机会主义者擂鼓助威，好比旧戏出“大将”以前乐队奏的“急急风”。在庐山会议之后，他着眼于海瑞的，是“丢了官，但他并不屈服，不丧气”，不灰溜溜的；很显然，这是为被罢了官的右倾机会主义者打气、鼓干劲，要他们“失败了再干”，而且还盼望着“海瑞”有朝一日“再居官重整纪纲”（见《海瑞罢官》剧本）哩！
    （关锋：《此地无银三百两！》见《文汇报》一九六六年一月十八日）
    用“为民请命”替右倾机会主义者涂脂抹粉
    当一九五九到一九六○年，我国遭遇到严重的自然灾害，在经济上出现了暂时的困难的时候，右倾机会主义分子大大活跃起来，他们完全撇开客观的因素，幸灾乐祸地诅咒领导群众运动的党。就在一九五九年的六月十六日，吴晗同志抛出了他的《海瑞骂皇帝》，借古讽今，同右倾机会主义分子的攻势相配合。他在这篇文章中含沙射影地说什么“人民想骂皇帝而不可得”，“真有人骂了，却也痛快”；又说什么“海瑞大骂皇帝，同情他和支持他的人到处都是，他的名声越来越大了”。吴晗同志说这些话是为了什么呢？难道能说不是借古骂今吗，难道能说不是为右倾机会主义的那种反党活动拍手称快，为他们撑腰打气吗？
    右倾机会主义分子攻击领导群众运动的党，却打着“为民请命”、捍卫农民利益的幌子，以农民利益的“保护者”自居，把自己打扮成农民的“救星”。党的八届八中全会剥下了右倾机会主义分子披着的这层“为民请命”的画皮，使他们的反党面目暴露无遗。这时吴晗同志又情急了，就赶紧在《论海瑞》《海瑞罢官》中大作文章，虚构了一个海瑞的高大形象，美化所谓“为民请命”的“英雄”。他说海瑞是“站在农民一边的”；他“一生处处事事为百姓设想、为民谋利”；他的“作为是对农民，特别对贫农、中农是有利的”；他为了农民的利益，“勇敢地把全生命投入战斗”。吴晗同志对海瑞的这种精心刻划，无非是想给右倾机会主义分子穿上海瑞的服装，借海瑞替右倾机会主义分子涂脂抹粉，并鼓动人们为右倾机会主义分子的反党活动喝采。
    （马泽民、王锐生：《“海瑞”是吴晗同志反党反社会主义的政治工具》，见《光明日报》一九六六年一月二十九日）
    给右倾机会主义者提供的标本
    吴晗同志在“自我批评”中竭力炫耀《论海瑞》这篇文章，说它“是反对右倾机会主义的，反对假冒、歪曲海瑞的”。为什么吴晗同志要在关于《海瑞罢官》的自我批评中抬出《论海瑞》这篇文章来炫耀？那是因为，他说他的《海瑞罢官》“是在《论海瑞》的基础上写成的”。既然我吴晗写《论海瑞》的动机不坏，写《海瑞罢官》的动机当然也是不坏的。
    那末，且看《论海瑞》中着重渲染和宣扬的又是些什么东西：
    海瑞是“不怕大官，敢顶大官的小官，敢替老百姓撑腰说话的小官”；他“卵翼穷民”，“站在农民一边”，“是当时被压抑，被欺侮，被冤屈人们的救星”；
    海瑞“是大丈夫，是古往今来一个真男子”；他痛心“现在医国的只一味甘草，处世的只两字乡愿”；
    海瑞说，“这等世界，做得成甚事业”；“民穷之故多端，大抵官不得其人为第一之害”；
    海瑞“意主于利民”，“为百姓痛哭”，“为百姓长太息”；
    海瑞“痛斥当时的社会风气”，“反对坏人坏事，不屈不挠，从不灰心丧气，勇敢地把全生命投入战斗”；他“曾经遭受攻击、排挤、辱骂，坐过牢，丢过官”，但他“是当代伟人”。
    我们要问吴晗同志：今天全国人民早已在共产党的领导下成了国家的主人，你号召学习海瑞“替老百姓撑腰说话”，究竟要向谁去说话呢？你号召学习海瑞做“被压抑、被欺侮、被冤屈人们的救星”，究竟哪些人是“被压抑、被欺侮、被冤屈的人”呢？你号召学习海瑞“把全生命投入战斗”，不怕坐牢丢官，究竟是要叫谁不怕坐牢丢官而去向谁战斗？很明显，吴晗同志写《论海瑞》的真正意图是在于借海瑞的躯壳，给右倾机会主义分子提供反党反社会主义的精神力量，激励他们起来进行反党反社会主义的活动。
    很显然，《论海瑞》和《海瑞罢官》的创作意图及其“为了活人服务”的目的是一样的。同样是浸透了对我们社会主义现实的不满情绪，表露了他的阴暗心理；同样是在为右倾机会主义分子鼓气，为他们唱赞歌。
    （吴文治：《不能用这样的自我批评回避政治问题》，见《光明日报》一九六六年一月十三日）
    鼓励右倾机会主义者的“斗争精神”
    在八届八中全会上，我党向右倾机会主义者进行了有力的回击。会后不久，吴晗同志发表了《论海瑞》，大谈海瑞的“为民做主”的思想，大力赞扬“敢顶大官的小官，敢替老百姓撑腰说话的小官”，大谈“百折不挠的斗争精神”，并且说：“这些品质，都是我们今天所需要学习和提倡的”。吴晗同志所提倡的海瑞精神，在当时的确起了对右倾机会主义者的赞扬和鼓励的作用。
    紧接着，在一九五九年底他又“破门而出”写了历史剧《海瑞罢官》。为什么要“破门而出”呢？这是因为吴晗同志看到了“戏剧的作用是远远超过书本的”，所以要占有舞台阵地使古人的“好品德”“深入人心”（见吴晗《再谈历史剧》）。《海瑞罢官》的产生，绝不是吴晗同志自己所说的“为古而古，为写戏而写戏”，而是有其政治目的的。这期间，正是右倾机会主义者被人民识破，被批判得体无完肤，被罢了“官”的时候。在吴晗同志看来，右倾机会主义者是由于“为民请命”而罢了“官”的，所以同情他们，为他们鸣不平，而且还鼓励他们“不为强暴所屈，不为失败所吓倒，失败了再干”，希望右倾机会主义者有朝一日“再居官重整纪纲”。
    （卢文辉、王悦：《吴晗同志为谁请命》，见《辽宁日报》一九六六年三月十日）
    反动的政治动机是隐瞒不住的
    吴晗同志把他有关文章的写作时间介绍了一下，认为《论海瑞》写于党的八届八中全会之后，是响应党的号召，“反对右倾机会主义的，反对假冒、歪曲海瑞的”；又说所有的文章“都是一九六○年以前写的”，表明他的《海瑞罢官》跟“单干风”、“翻案风”无关。
    就以吴晗同志介绍的写作时间来说，也是不符合真实情况的。事实是，除了《海瑞骂皇帝》发表于党的八届八中全会之前以外，还有《海瑞的故事》发表于一九五九年七月一日出版的《新观察》；《清官海瑞》发表于一九五九年七月二十三日《北京日报》。这三篇歌颂海瑞的文章都写于八届八中全会之前，显然不是为了反对右倾机会主义的。而《论海瑞》是在上述三篇文章的基础上写成的，其政治观点、历史观点跟上述三篇文章完全一致，那么请问：这篇文章的写作动机，为什么突然变成反右倾机会主义？
    由于连续几年的自然灾害，我国经济遇到暂时困难，帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义一再发动反华高潮，国内的阶级敌人以为有机可乘，又一次向社会主义发动进攻，极力鼓吹“单干风”、“翻案风”，并在意识形态领域里，散布封建主义、资产阶级和修正主义的东西。正是在这样的几年中，吴晗同志写文章、编剧本，一而再、再而三地鼓吹海瑞，而且又是狂热地鼓吹海瑞的“退田”“平冤狱”，狂热地鼓吹海瑞的“不为强暴所屈，不为失败所吓倒，失败了再干的坚强意志。”这不是为地主阶级、资产阶级要求恢复个体经济、恢复资本主义的复辟活动张目吗？不是为失败了的反党反社会主义分子鼓气吗？事实就是事实，创作《海瑞罢官》的政治动机是隐瞒不了的。
    （黄祖良　林铁民　蔡景康：《反动的政治动机是隐瞒不住的》，见《福建日报》一九六六年二月二十七日）
    为被“罢”了“官”的右倾机会主义分子招魂
    为右倾机会主义者塑造的“英雄”形象
    当右倾机会主义者遭到党和人民的坚决斗争，一败涂地的时候，吴晗同志给他们以精神上的安慰和支持，要他们罢了官，也“心胸开朗”，说什么“纵然丢官不见谅，清名千古永流芳”。《海瑞罢官》的前几稿中还有这样一句话：“这年头，越是好官，越要丢官。”在《海瑞罢官》里，吴晗同志发泄了。他对党和人民反对右倾机会主义的斗争极为不满，认为他们是“好官”，为他们的“罢官”喊冤叫屈，打“抱不平”。《海瑞罢官》不但是为被人民所唾弃而“罢官”了的右倾机会主义分子唱赞歌，而且鼓励他们“失败了再干”，等待有朝一日，“再居官重整纪纲”，也就是要他们在反党反社会主义的路上走到底。“海瑞”实实在在是一个顽固到底的右倾机会主义者的“英雄”形象。
    所谓“退田”、“除霸”、“罢官”，在现实生活里，实质上是同一个问题的不同方面，而其核心在于“罢官”。右倾机会主义分子所叫嚷的人民公社“办早了，办糟了”，就是要“退田”。他们攻其一点，不计其余，把我们的伟大事业和我们的干部队伍说成“黑漆一团”，因此叫嚣“除霸”，“除害先除当道狼”，反党反人民反社会主义“英雄”的“退田”和“除霸”的进攻失败了，被撤职了，但还妄想卷土重来，这就是“罢官”的真谛。事实很清楚，吴晗同志正是接过右倾机会主义手里的武器，再把它磨光擦亮，用来反对党，反对社会主义。这就是从《论海瑞》到《海瑞罢官》贯穿的一条黑线。吴晗同志现在打起“反对右倾机会主义”的幌子，不是欲盖弥彰吗？
    历史对于一切不愿意投身革命潮流走历史必由之路的人，总是无情的。吴晗同志从民主革命时期进到了社会主义社会，但是他的头脑里还装着许多剥削阶级的脏东西，根本不知道什么是无产阶级思想，什么是共产主义，什么是党。所以当他的未曾彻底改造的资产阶级立场和世界观，越来越同深入发展的社会主义革命发生矛盾的时候，在一次新的激烈的阶级斗争中，他就站到了反对社会主义、进攻社会主义的阶级敌人的一方面，同右倾机会主义“坐在一条板凳上”了，同地富反坏分子“坐在一条板凳上”了。
    （澄宇：《〈海瑞罢官〉为谁唱赞歌？》见《北京日报》一九六六年一月十八日）
    为“罢官”的右倾机会主义者鸣不平
    吴晗同志为了掩饰他的动机，竭力把动机和效果分开。他在他的文章一开头，就列了一个从《海瑞骂皇帝》到《海瑞罢官》的写作时间表；对这种用意，我们是能懂得的，那是在用写作时间和主题等等，竭力辩白《海瑞罢官》同“单干风”、“翻案风”无关。不看文章的写作时间还罢，一看文章的写作时间，真相就大白于天下，恰好暴露了吴晗同志写作的政治动机。一九五九年六月，正当庐山会议前夕，这时右倾机会主义分子正在肆无忌惮地向党进攻，污蔑三面红旗，辱骂群众运动。而正当这时，吴晗同志写了《海瑞骂皇帝》，极力赞扬一种抽象的“骂皇帝”的勇气和胆量。试问，选择这一个时间，写这样的文章，岂不是同右倾机会主义分子的反党反社会主义活动紧紧相呼应吗？一九五九年九月，庐山会议后，右倾机会主义分子受到了党和人民的反击，他们的反党面目暴露无遗，完全陷于孤立。这时候，吴晗同志就迫不及待地赶写了《论海瑞》，竭力宣传“为民请命”和抽象的“傲骨精神”，据他说这是为了“反对右倾机会主义的”。但在我们看来，事情决不是这样，而且恰恰相反，其用意明明是在为右倾机会主义分子打气，要他们同党同人民对抗到底。一九五九年年底，右倾机会主义分子遭到了彻底的失败。吴晗同志又于此时在《论海瑞》的基础上动笔赶写《海瑞罢官》。这个剧本的主题，据吴晗同志说不是退田，而是除霸。但是，在我们看来，这个剧本的主题是“罢官”，是对那些自称“为民请命”而被罢官的反党反人民的“英雄”，寄予了无限深切的同情，为他们鸣不平，出主意。要他们象海瑞那样，罢了官，也决不善罢甘休，也不能走得灰溜溜的。
    这样一个写作时间表，这些文章和剧本的这种主题思想，说明什么呢？它告诉我们，吴晗同志是在用海瑞的幽灵，为右倾机会主义分子，为一切反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神，表同情，抱冤屈，鸣不平，出谋划策，撑腰打气。
    （史绍宾：《评〈关于《海瑞罢官》的自我批评〉的几个问题》，见《光明日报》一九六六年一月九日）
    破门而出，支持“不怕丢官”的“英雄”
    吴晗同志一九五九年发表《海瑞骂皇帝》，有的人还为它大加吹捧，大书特书。我们认为这种情况的出现绝不是偶然的。
    大家还记得，一九五九年到一九六二年，在我国经济遭到暂时困难，帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义一再发动反华高潮的情况下，国内阶级敌人又一次向社会主义发动猖狂的进攻。就在这种情况下，右倾机会主义分子也配合国内外阶级敌人，攻击党的总路线和具体方针政策。一九五九年六月，正是庐山会议前夕，右倾机会主义分子向党中央发动猖狂进攻，反对总路线，辱骂群众运动。也就是在这个时候，吴晗同志抛出了他的《海瑞骂皇帝》，歌颂海瑞谩骂皇帝的“大无畏”精神，说海瑞“骂”嘉靖“家家穷得干干净净，没有钱用”，是“骂得非常痛快”，这难道会是偶然巧合，不是有所为而发的吗？一九五九年年底，当右倾机会主义分子遭到彻底失败，有些人被罢了官免了职的时候，吴晗同志又不惜“破门而出”，赶写他的新编历史剧《海瑞罢官》，把海瑞描绘成一个“为民请命”“不怕丢官”的英雄。这一切不正是配合右倾机会主义分子对党和社会主义的猖狂进攻吗？除此以外，还能做什么别的解释呢？
    （王希曾、杨寿堪：《为什么要歌颂〈海瑞骂皇帝〉？》见《北京日报》一九六六年一月十四日）
    鼓吹右倾机会主义者卷土重来
    一九五九年至一九六一年，正是我国遭到连续三年的特大的自然灾害，我们的社会主义建设事业遇着暂时的困难。这时候，国际上的现代修正主义集团勾结帝国主义和各国反动派演出反华大合唱。在国内，一小撮牛鬼蛇神正在蠢蠢而动，掀起一股反社会主义的逆流。右倾机会主义分子打出“为人民利益”的幌子，披上马列主义的外衣，向党、向社会主义发动进攻，攻击三面红旗。他们的进攻，遭到坚持走社会主义道路的广大人民的坚决反击。
    不迟不早，吴晗同志在这时写出了《海瑞罢官》。并在《海瑞罢官》的序里说：“这个戏着重写海瑞的刚直不阿、不为强暴所屈，不为失败所吓倒，失败了再干的坚强意志。……海瑞丢了官，但他并不屈服，不丧气。”的确，吴晗同志在《海瑞罢官》里，把一个站在封建统治阶级立场，为维护统治阶级长远利益的忠仆，美化、歌颂为一个“站在农民一边”为“农民利益而斗争”，因而被“罢”了官的英雄形象。这是为什么呢？他在《关于历史剧的一些问题》一文里，介绍写《海瑞罢官》的体会时说：“写这个人，演这个人……不是为死人而是为活人服务”。为什么样的活人服务？说穿了就是替当时假冒代表农民利益、叫嚣要“单干”、“平反冤狱”的右倾机会主义分子打气，要他们丢了官，“不屈服，不丧气”，“失败了再干”，“有一日再居官重整纪纲”卷土重来。吴晗同志通过对海瑞的美化、歌颂，寄托了自己对右倾机会主义分子的同情，发泄了他对社会主义的深刻不满。从《海瑞罢官》演出和出版后的社会效果来看，也充分说明了这一点。
    吴晗同志在他的《海瑞罢官》中，假借海瑞之名，攻击今天的社会主义。因此，我们说：它是一株大毒草！
    （杨光楣：《〈海瑞罢官〉究竟在宣扬什么？》见《云南日报》一九六六年二月二十二日）
    为“单干”、“翻案”煽风点火
    大肆叫嚣“退田”、“平冤狱”
    吴晗同志在“自我批评”中不仅不承认《海瑞罢官》的政治错误，反而说是为了“反对右倾机会主义”。但是，事实不容抵赖。
    一九五九年——一九六一年间，国内外的阶级斗争形势异常尖锐复杂。国际上，美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派掀起了反华大合唱。国内，首先是右倾机会主义分子出来反对党的领导，攻击三面红旗，说“人民公社办早了，办糟了”。接着，社会上又吹起了一阵“单干风”、“翻案风”，主张把公社的土地分给个人，实行“包产到户”，要求给地富反坏平反“冤狱”。作为一个革命的文艺工作者，应当拿起文艺的武器，打击敌人，消灭敌人，把矛头指向资本主义、封建主义势力，兴无产阶级思想，灭资产阶级、地主阶级思想。吴晗同志不仅没有这样做，相反倒“破门而出”，写了《海瑞罢官》，来火上加油。我们的人民振臂高呼：总路线、大跃进、人民公社万岁！《海瑞罢官》所表现的却是：清官、王法、封建主义万岁！（洪阿兰：“青天大老爷为民雪恨，公侯万代”。）通过海瑞的口大唱：“江南困苦凄凉相，不退占田不久长”，“冤狱重重要平反，退田才能使民安”。作者并把海瑞描写成了一个专门搞“退田”“平反冤狱”的“为民请命”的“不怕死”的“英雄”，百般颂赞。在无产阶级专政的社会主义国家里，广大农民群众早在党的领导下打倒了压在他们头上的敌人，报了仇、伸了冤，坚定地走上了社会主义道路的今天，《海瑞罢官》中的这样一些描写，究竟是在替谁说话、为谁服务、对谁有利，不是很清楚吗？
    （李衍柱：《布历史的迷雾，唱时代的反调》，见《文艺报》一九六六年第一期）
    煽动牛鬼蛇神兴风作浪
    从解放初期到一九五八年的九年间，吴晗同志在历次思想斗争中都异常沉默，甚至连批判胡适思想这样同他有特殊关系的斗争，都没有发言。但是，从一九五九年起，吴晗同志却突然开始活跃起来，“大写特写”。他从《海瑞骂皇帝》、《论海瑞》一直到“破门而出”写出了《海瑞罢官》，三年间就写了大小文章将近一百五十篇。是什么使吴晗同志这么“难受”，“非写不可”？他又写了些什么呢？他着重描写的是：“乡官强暴百姓穷，如狼似虎田野空”，“冤狱重重要平反，退田才能使民安”。接着，他从封建文化的武库里捡起了一件破烂法宝，祭将起来。这就是“为民作主”，鼓励人们“告状”。《海瑞罢官》，就是吴晗同志宣扬“告状也是阶级斗争的一种低级形式”的宣言书。吴晗同志的文章，是助长当时社会上的牛鬼蛇神掀起“翻案风”的一把火。事实正是这样。在《海瑞罢官》剧本发表后，上海有个特务的家属，就递了一份要求“平冤狱”的“状纸”，上面公然写道：“在现世除非海瑞重生，方能超雪，否则就此埋送。”这不就是吴晗同志的新“告状”论的现实政治意义么？如果吴晗同志不同意我们的这些分析，希望他能够把自己的观点说得更清楚些，究竟该怎样理解这种“新”理论。
   （罗思鼎：《论“告状”》，见《文汇报》一九六六年四月一日）
    为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道
    吴晗同志在《海瑞罢官》里大写“退田”，宣传在封建社会里农民“有土地何愁衣饭，好光景就在眼前”，把它作为一种农民的天堂、理想生活来宣扬，这是什么意思呢？且不说历史上从来没有哪个剥削阶级自动把田“退”给农民的事情，而农民就是有了土地，就真能过好日子吗？我国农民在中国共产党的领导下，经过土地改革运动，破天荒地做了土地的主人。但是，如果广大农民仅仅停留在分得土地，而不进一步地实行社会主义改造，走集体化、人民公社的道路，我国广大农民仍然不能从根本上摆脱贫困、落后的状况，而且保持小农私有经济还会有利于封建主义和资本主义势力的卷土重来。因此，在社会主义革命阶段鼓吹什么农民有了土地就有美好光景，那就决不是在为农民说话，恰恰是违背了农民的根本利益，而为反社会主义的资本主义复辟妄想服务。而在一九六一年前后出现单干风的情况下来鼓吹这种主张，那就更是一种对社会主义的猖狂进攻。
   （徐公持、周铜：《〈海瑞罢官〉散布了反社会主义的毒素》，见《工人日报》一九六六年三月十八日）
    向党、向人民、向社会主义猖狂进攻
    坚持资产阶级立场，反对社会主义革命
    在我们国家里，从一九五九年到一九六二年，阶级斗争是很激烈的。吴晗同志正是在这个时候“破门而出”，不但通过新编历史剧《海瑞罢官》，而且通过杂文、学术论文、历史故事等等，突出地歌颂海瑞的所谓“好品德”和“斗争精神”；正是在这个时候突出地宣扬封建道德，要把封建道德“古为今用”，“移用在今天”、“应用于今天”；正是在这个时候，突出地攻击马克思主义，维护历史上的帝王将相，反对“是今非古”（《灯下集》六五页）；正是在这个时候“骨鲠在喉”（《学习集》二七三页），非“把它写出来”不可，等等。所有这些是偶然的吗？不，这是阶级斗争的反映。毛主席说：“资产阶级、小资产阶级，他们的思想意识是一定要反映出来的。一定要在政治问题和思想问题上，用各种办法顽强地表现他们自己。”（《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》）吴晗同志的“破门而出”，“坚持到底”，关键就在这里。
    所有这些，是目的性“不清楚”的“糊涂”在作怪吗？是“为古而古”在作怪吗？当然不是。吴晗同志“破门而出”创作这个新编历史剧《海瑞罢官》，是有意识、有目的、有计划地为右倾机会主义者张目，反对社会主义革命。毛主席说：“无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。”（同上）这就是问题的本质所在。
    （吴传启：《吴晗同志“破门而出”为了什么？》见《光明日报》一九六六年一月十九日）
    妄想拆社会主义的台，走资本主义道路
    吴晗同志竭力使人相信：《海瑞罢官》即使有错误的话，也只是个学术问题，而不是政治问题。这是十足的自欺欺人的话！那些站在封建地主阶级、资产阶级的立场上，对党对社会主义心怀不满的人，他们虽也在学术领域内做文章，而干的却是以学术作为保护色，反对马克思列宁主义、反对毛泽东思想，向党向社会主义进攻。这当然不是什么学术问题，而是政治问题。
    这是他从史学领域中反对毛泽东思想，进而至于更加明目张胆地，扩大阵地，煽风点火，要拆社会主义的台。试问吴晗同志：在阶级斗争大反复的那几年内，你这样狂热，搞出这样一套反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想、反社会主义的东西，难道是学术问题？能说不是政治问题？
    吴晗同志说，他“脱离了政治，脱离了现实”。这完全是假话。从吴晗同志这些年的一贯活动看，他不但没有脱离政治，没有脱离现实，而且是一个具有强烈的政治嗅觉的、很懂得政治斗争是怎么一回事的人。不过这里需要说明的是：他搞的是资产阶级政治，而不是无产阶级政治。
    （史绍宾：《评〈关于《海瑞罢官》的自我批评〉的几个问题》，见《光明日报》一九六六年一月九日）
    这是一场严重的阶级斗争
    一九六一年左右，国际上出现了赫鲁晓夫为首的现代修正主义集团，他们千方百计地美化美帝国主义，说什么美国垄断集团，也有“明智”派呀，宣扬“三和”投降路线；在国内形形色色的阶级敌人乘机蠢动，他们趁我们国家由于自然灾害在经济上受到了暂时的困难，企图复辟倒算。吴晗同志正是选择这个时机，有计划、有目的地大写而特写海瑞，大讲而特讲海瑞，说什么海瑞是大“清官”，应当肯定，应当歌颂啊，什么海瑞是“被压抑、被欺侮、被冤屈人们的救星”啊，什么海瑞是人民心目中的“好官”啊，是值得研究与学习啊，这究竟适应什么人的需要，不是很明显吗？
    我们绝对不能上吴晗同志阶级调和论的当，一定要和他划清界限，把他“借古讽今”反社会主义的面貌揭露在光天化日之下。
    《海瑞罢官》决不单纯是一个学术问题，而是一个重大的政治性问题。它是政治战线上和经济战线上阶级斗争的反映，是意识形态上的一场严重的阶级斗争。吴晗同志是希望我们工人阶级能跟着海瑞跑，替那些在无产阶级专政下失去了自由的地富反坏分子摇旗呐喊。
    既然吴晗同志披着学术研究的外衣，为资产阶级、封建地主阶级的政治服务，向我们工人阶级、无产阶级专政发动进攻，那末，在这场大辩论中，我们工人同志应该予以坚决的、有力的回击。
