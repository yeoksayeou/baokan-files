    Little Zou and Little Zhang
    Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Chen Mingjing
    Zou Guizhi works on crane No. 7 in the rolling mill, right next to Zhang Shengyun, a female worker on crane No. 8. Little Zou studies and applies Chairman Mao's works in a living way, making rapid progress and becoming an activist in studying Chairman Mao's works at Anshan Iron and Steel Company. However, Little Zhang has not tasted the sweetness of studying Chairman Mao's works, her work is not very outstanding, and her relationships with the masses are not very good. Little Zou is eager to help her and make progress together.
    One day, when both of them were not busy, Little Zou thought, I have never been on Little Zhang's crane, I should take this opportunity to go to her crane and have a look. Unexpectedly, as soon as she got on the crane, Little Zhang coldly asked, "What are you doing on my crane?"
    "Just coming to see you."
    "We see each other every day, what's to see?"
    Little Zou smiled and said, "Look at you, you're talking nonsense!"
    "Little Zou, let me tell you, no one can 'scrape oil' off me! Don't be like a mouse under your armpit – a fake activist!"
    Little Zou still wanted to say something, but she had already been given the order to leave. She ran into such a big snag the first time.
    Back on her own crane, Little Zou calmly thought about why Little Zhang treated her like this. Little Zou analyzed Little Zhang's strengths and weaknesses and realized that she and some comrades had been somewhat one-sided in their view of Little Zhang in the past, which had dampened Little Zhang's enthusiasm. After that, Little Zou took the initiative to get closer to Little Zhang, and Little Zhang also became closer to Little Zou through these contacts.
    Once, when they were cleaning the crane, after finishing work, Little Zhang noticed that Little Zou's hand was scratched, and she quickly tore a strip of cloth from her own clothes to bandage Little Zou. This made the two of them feel even closer. During the conversation, Little Zou told her family history, recalling the tragic situation of her mother leading her to beg for food when she was a child. Little Zou's suffering aroused Little Zhang's sad memories, and it turned out that Little Zhang was also a melon born on a bitter vine.
    Little Zhang gradually became enlightened. Little Zou then further helped her study Chairman Mao's works, telling her the stories of Bethune and Zhang Side, explaining the principle that doing work is doing revolution. Every Sunday, Little Zou often went to Little Zhang's home to introduce her own study experiences and exchange learning experiences with each other. Combining simple reminiscences of past bitterness with studying Chairman Mao's works significantly improved her class consciousness. Little Zhang regretted that she had misunderstood Little Zou, and to express her apology, she would help Little Zou brush her shoes and wash her work clothes when she saw Little Zou was busy. Little Zou thought, Little Zhang is changing recently and is very close to me. But to completely help her transform, we must rely on the power of the masses and let her stand up among the masses.
    One day, Little Zou talked to Little Zhang again, Little Zou said, "Little Zhang, I am grateful to you for helping me brush my shoes and wash my clothes. However, to improve comrade relations, it cannot be limited to just between us." Little Zhang said, "I also think so, but what should I do?" Little Zou encouraged Little Zhang to respect the master workers in everything and take the time to help the master workers with odd jobs. Then, she encouraged Little Zhang to promote the spirit of active cooperation in her work and cooperate well with the master workers operating on the ground. The master workers' view of Little Zhang also changed accordingly. In the past, they often blamed her, but now they often praised her. Little Zhang's mood also became more and more cheerful. Her work also became more and more outstanding.

    小邹和小张
    鞍山钢铁公司　陈明镜
    邹桂枝在轧辊厂天车班七号车劳动，紧挨着她的是八号车女工张生云。小邹活学活用毛主席著作，进步很快，成了鞍山钢铁公司学习毛主席著作积极分子。但是小张却没有尝到学习毛主席著作的甜头，工作不很出色，群众关系也不太好。小邹有心想帮助她，和她共同进步。
    有一天，正好她们俩都没有忙活儿，小邹想，我从未上过小张的车，乘这机会就到她车上去看一看。万万没想到，刚到车上，小张就冷冰冰问一句：“你到我车上来干什么？”
    “来看看你呗。”
    “天天见面，有啥好看的？”
    小邹笑了笑说：“你看你，越说越远啦！”
    “小邹，我告诉你，谁想在我身上‘刮油’，办不到！别胳肢窝夹耗子——假积极啦！”
    小邹还想说点啥，可人家已经下了逐客令。第一次就碰了这么个大钉子。
    回到自己车上，小邹冷静地想了想，为啥小张这样对我呢？小邹分析了小张的优缺点，发觉自己和有些同志过去看小张或多或少带有片面性，挫伤了小张的积极性。以后小邹就主动多接近小张，小张也从这些接触中与小邹较为亲近了。
    有一次，她们打扫天车，干完活后，小张发现小邹的手被擦破了，赶忙从自己衣襟上撕下一条布来给小邹包扎。这一来，两人更觉得亲近了。谈话间，小邹诉起了自己的家史，忆及小时候母亲领她要饭的悲惨境遇。小邹的苦勾起了小张的辛酸事，原来小张也是苦藤上生的瓜。
    小张逐渐觉悟起来了。小邹便进一步帮助她学习毛主席著作。给她讲白求恩、张思德的故事，阐明干工作就是干革命的道理。每到星期天，小邹常常到小张家里，向她介绍自己的学习体会，互相交流学习心得。朴素的忆苦思甜，同学习毛主席著作相结合，阶级觉悟就显著地提高。小张后悔自己曾错怪过小邹，为了表示歉意，她瞅小邹忙的时候，就去帮小邹刷鞋、洗作业服。小邹心想，小张最近是在转变，与自己很亲近。但是要彻底帮助她转变，还得依靠群众的力量，让她在群众中站立起来。
    一天，小邹又和小张谈心，小邹说：“小张，你帮我刷鞋、洗衣服，我感激你。不过，搞好同志关系，不能光限于咱俩之间。”小张说：“我也这样想，可是怎样做呀？”小邹就鼓励小张凡事要尊敬师傅，抽空就帮师傅干点零活。接着，又鼓励小张在工作中发扬主动协作精神，与地面操作的师傅配合得好好的。师傅们对小张的看法也随之转变，过去常常责怪她，现在则经常表扬她。小张的心情也日益舒畅起来。工作也越干越出色了。
