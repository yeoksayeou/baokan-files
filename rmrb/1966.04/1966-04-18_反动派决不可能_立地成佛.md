    Reactionaries Can Never "Achieve Buddhahood on the Spot"
    Fang Guozhong, Soldier of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    Zhao Chongwu and Zheng Hanchen in "Besieged City" are both Kuomintang officers who, although not from Chiang Kai-shek's direct line of troops, similarly represent the interests of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie. In their anti-communist, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary stance, they are no different in essence from the Kuomintang Central Army. Minister Jiang, however, says to these ferocious enemies, "As long as they lay down their butcher knives, they can achieve Buddhahood on the spot." It is true that there have been uprisings by some counter-revolutionary generals in history, but it is necessary to recognize the fact that reactionaries throughout history are unwilling to automatically withdraw from the stage of history; they revolt because they are forced by the situation. Although they have laid down the butcher knives in their hands, it is impossible for them to achieve Buddhahood on the spot. The playwright uses Minister Jiang to say such words, no more than to promote to the audience that the enemy can be won over by private affections, and can be influenced by the bourgeois "human touch," and they will quickly stand on the side of the people. This view is a view of class reconciliation.
    This film tries its best to beautify the enemy and uglify the laboring people. The film has a plot: Zheng Hanchen prevents his subordinates from looting the people's food, preferring to let his troops go hungry. This is completely to exonerate the Kuomintang reactionaries and distort the facts. I am from Changchun. When Changchun was besieged by the People's Liberation Army in 1947, I was in Changchun. At that time, the Kuomintang army was looting and committing all kinds of atrocities everywhere. My family of six lived so bitterly that we could not eat enough, living by eating wild vegetables dug by my older siblings, and eating bran. There were only a few kilograms of soybeans left at home. My father was reluctant to eat them and was afraid that the Kuomintang army would come to rob them, so he buried them in the ground. Later, the whole family was so hungry that my father dug out the beans and wanted to stir-fry them and divide them among everyone, but when they were stir-frying, Zhang Damaizi from the Kuomintang army smelled the fragrance and robbed all the beans. My family had no choice but to go hungry. There are many guys like Zhang Damaizi in the reactionary army, and I have never seen a "good-hearted person" like Zheng Hanchen.
    The film not only beautifies the reactionary fellow Zheng Hanchen, but what is even more hateful is that it makes the common people kneel down to Zheng to thank him for his kindness, saying, "Sir, you have accumulated great virtue." Writing the laboring people without any backbone is the greatest uglification of the laboring people. For example, when the Kuomintang army fled in all directions, Zheng Hanchen and his wife fostered their "young master" in the home of the common people, and our laboring people were actually willing to raise the reactionaries' "young master." Look, how harmonious the relationship between the reactionaries and the laboring people is! What is this if not class reconciliation?
    In short, the guiding ideology of this film is revisionist, and it tries its best to promote supra-class "human nature." The film attempts to prove to the audience that the only difference between us and the enemy is our clothing, and there is not much difference in essence. The enemy's counter-revolutionary nature is easy to change.... At present, the world situation is in a period of great turbulence, great division, and great reorganization, and the revolutionary people need revolutionary literature and art even more to inspire them to fight against imperialism and revisionism. However, the poisonous weed "Besieged City" has played a completely opposite role. We must thoroughly criticize it.

    反动派决不可能“立地成佛”
    中国人民解放军某部战士　房国忠
    《兵临城下》中的赵崇武和郑汉臣，这两个国民党军官，虽然不是蒋介石的嫡系部队，但同样都是代表大地主、大资产阶级的利益的。他们在反共反人民、反革命这点上，和国民党中央军一样，本质上丝毫没有差别。姜部长对这两个凶恶的敌人，却说“只要放下屠刀，就能立地成佛。”不错，历史上是有过一些反革命将领起义的事，但必须要认清这样一个事实，历来的反动派都是不甘愿自动退出历史舞台的，他们所以起义，是为形势所迫。他们手里的屠刀虽然放下了，决不可能立地成佛。编剧所以要借姜部长的口说这样的话，无非是要向观众宣传：敌人是可以用私情的拉拢，用资产阶级的“人情味”去感化，他们会很快站到人民的立场上来的。这种观点，是阶级调和论的观点。
    这部影片，极力美化敌人、丑化劳动人民。影片有个情节：郑汉臣阻止部下抢老百姓的粮食，宁肯让自己的部队挨饿。这完全是为国民党反动派开脱罪责，歪曲事实。我是长春人，一九四七年长春被解放军围困时，我就在长春。当时的国民党军队，到处抢劫，胡作非为。我家六口人，生活苦得吃不上饭，吃哥哥姐姐挖的野菜，吃麸子过活。家里只剩下几斤黄豆，父亲舍不得吃，又怕国民党军队来抢，就把它埋在地里。后来，全家人实在饿得不行了，父亲才把豆子挖出来，想炒炒分给大家吃一点，不料炒的时候，国民党军队里的张大麻子闻到香味，就把豆子全部抢走，我们一家人只得挨饿。反动军队里象张大麻子这样的家伙多的是，象郑汉臣这样的“好心人”我没见过。
    影片不但美化了郑汉臣这个反动家伙，更可恨的是让老百姓向郑下跪，感谢郑的恩德，说什么：“长官，您可积了大德了。”把劳动人民写得没有一点骨气，这是对劳动人民最大的丑化。又譬如，国民党军队四处逃窜时，郑汉臣夫妇把“少爷”寄养在老百姓家，而我们的劳动人民，也居然愿意为反动派抚养他们的“少爷”，你看，反动派和劳动人民之间的关系多么融洽！这不是阶级调和又是什么？
    总之，这部影片的主导思想是修正主义的，它极力提倡超阶级的“人性”。影片企图向观众证明，我们和敌人之间，只是服装不同，本质上没有多少差别，敌人的反革命本性是很容易改变的……。眼下，世界形势正处在大动荡、大分化、大改组之际，革命人民更加需要革命文艺来鼓舞他们同帝国主义、修正主义作斗争，《兵临城下》这棵毒草，却起了完全相反的作用。我们必须彻底加以批判。
