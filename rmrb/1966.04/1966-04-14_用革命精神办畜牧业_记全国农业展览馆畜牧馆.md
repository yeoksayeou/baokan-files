    Run Animal Husbandry with Revolutionary Spirit
    ——On the Animal Husbandry Pavilion of the National Agricultural Exhibition Hall
    After seeing the Animal Husbandry Pavilion of the National Agricultural Exhibition Hall, I got a strong impression: many advanced typical units that have achieved relatively rapid development in animal husbandry are resolutely following Chairman Mao's teaching that agriculture and animal husbandry must be developed simultaneously, using the spirit of daring to revolt and continuously revolt, recognizing objective laws from continuous practice, creating favorable conditions, and pushing animal husbandry production forward step by step.
    This is the common experience of the thirty-one typical units exhibited in the Animal Husbandry Pavilion, and also the common experience of many other regions that have achieved remarkable results in developing animal husbandry.
    Advancing on the Road of Simultaneous Development of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry
    Animal husbandry and agriculture have an interdependent and mutually promoting relationship. Agriculture obtains draft animals and fertilizer from animal husbandry, and animal husbandry relies on agriculture to provide feed. Therefore, without the development of animal husbandry, agriculture will be difficult to develop; without developing agriculture, the development of animal husbandry will also be limited. Conversely, the development of any one of them will create favorable conditions for the development of the other.
    Since liberation, especially since the people's communization, more and more cadres and masses in various regions of the country, following Chairman Mao’s instruction, based on the objective law of interdependence and mutual promotion between agriculture and animal husbandry, that agriculture and animal husbandry must be developed simultaneously, have dared to revolt and dared to practice, embarked on the road of simultaneous development of agriculture and animal husbandry, and promoted the great leap forward of agriculture and animal husbandry. The nineteen units exhibited in the first room of the Animal Husbandry Pavilion are typical examples of this kind of combination of more livestock, more fertilizer, and more grain, and the simultaneous development of agriculture and animal husbandry.
    Raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer, and promoting grain production with pigs, is an important way for the vast agricultural areas to move towards the simultaneous development of agriculture and animal husbandry. Huangcaolang Brigade of Dalang Commune in Dongguan County, Guangdong Province, does not rely on mountains in front and does not lean on water in the back. Before liberation, it was a place with barren land and poor people. After liberation, on the basis of basically passing the water conservancy hurdle, they resolutely implemented the policy of developing grain and pigs simultaneously, tried every means to open up feed sources, and actively developed pig raising, so that every team ran pig farms and every household raised pigs to accumulate fertilizer, transforming low-yield fields. In this way, in the past four years, agriculture and animal husbandry have developed comprehensively, and production and life have improved year by year. In 1965, the entire brigade raised an average of more than ten pigs per household, exceeding the target set by the "National Agricultural Development Program" by two times, and the average grain yield per mu exceeded one thousand catties, and the income of commune members increased significantly.
    Similar units that raise an average of more than ten pigs per household and whose grain yield per mu reaches or exceeds the "National Agricultural Development Program" include Xitang Brigade of Dahu Commune in Changsha County, Hunan Province, and Chengezhuang Brigade of Mulin Commune in Shunyi County, Beijing.
    Breeding more large livestock is another important measure to promote agricultural production. Especially in areas with abundant water and grass, efforts should be made to develop large livestock and make them a large livestock breeding base for the country. Weichang County, Hebei Province, has made achievements in this regard.
    Weichang County is a semi-grassland area, and the masses have historically had the habit of breeding large livestock. However, in the early days of liberation, there were only more than 31,000 heads of large livestock in the entire county. In recent years, especially since the establishment of a large livestock breeding base in 1962, the county has adopted the method of concentrating forces to fight annihilation battles to breed large livestock. According to the characteristics of the county, they strengthened grassland management, made overall plans, made unified arrangements, clearly divided reclamation areas, closed areas, and grazing areas, and reasonably resolved the contradiction between agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry competing for land. In terms of livestock feeding and management, a series of reform measures were taken, such as changing unmanned grazing to following-the-herd grazing, changing tankless mixed penning to tanked and separated penning, and changing in-pen fertilizer accumulation to out-of-pen fertilizer accumulation. In this way, by 1965, there were 115,000 heads of large livestock in pens, an increase of 26.9% compared with 1962; grain output also increased by 36.8%; and 28,700 heads of large livestock were supported to brother counties and communes. The achievements are very outstanding.
    Other typical units exhibited in the Animal Husbandry Pavilion, such as Fuchuan County in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Chenxiang Commune in Changtai County, Fujian Province, Wanshunbao Commune in Nongan County, Jilin Province, and Fulu Commune in Fuyu County, Heilongjiang Province, also have roughly the same experience. This powerfully shows that once the idea of simultaneous development of agriculture and animal husbandry is grasped by the vast number of cadres and masses, it will become a huge material force. It pushes agriculture and animal husbandry step by step towards a new realm of comprehensive development.
    Only by Relying on the Masses can We Achieve Self-Reliance
    In running animal husbandry, should we reach out to the state, or should we rely on self-reliance? Chairman Mao once said: "What should our policy be based on? Based on the base point of our own strength, called self-reliance." This means that we must rely on self-reliance in running all undertakings, and of course, this is also the case in running animal husbandry.
    However, how can we achieve self-reliance? The common experience of the exhibiting units is: rely on the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen.
    Animal husbandry, whether it is production or construction, is always inseparable from thousands of farmers and herdsmen. Without the broad masses, there is no way to talk about developing animal husbandry. Of course, relying on the masses must be combined with doing ideological and political work among the masses. Only when the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen have socialist consciousness can they become a powerful force to rely on. The advanced deeds of Yongji County, Shanxi Province, in developing large livestock are a victory for the mass line and the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance.
    Yongji County is a plain area with no grassland and no slopes. The conditions for developing animal husbandry are very poor. For many years, people have been constrained by conditions and dared not change the situation of severe shortage of large livestock. Every year, they have to buy livestock from other places. Before 1963, about 1,000 heads of draft animals had to be purchased from other places every year. Many production teams also frequently experienced people pushing millstones, people pulling plows, and people pushing waterwheels. Since 1963, the leading cadres at all levels here have been determined to change the method of relying solely on foreign aid, relying on the masses, self-reliance, and self-breeding of large livestock through studying Chairman Mao's works and the party's policies. The county party secretary and other leading cadres went deep into the masses to investigate and study, summarized and promoted the experience of "fixing basic breeding female livestock," and greatly mobilized the enthusiasm of the masses in the county for self-breeding and self-raising of large livestock. Therefore, in the past three years, the number of large livestock in the county has developed rapidly. In 1962, there were only 27,181 heads of large livestock in the county. By the end of 1965, the county had developed to 34,930 heads, a net increase of 28.5%. Due to the development of large livestock, the increase in fertilizer, and meticulous cultivation, the county's grain and cotton output has increased more than doubled.
    The pastoral areas of Aksai Kazakh Autonomous County in Gansu Province mostly belong to desert grasslands. When drought is encountered, pasture growth is slow, which seriously affects grazing. From 1960 to 1962, the county experienced continuous severe drought, and pasture was severely insufficient, which brought a huge threat to animal husbandry. Faced with the severe drought, the leading departments at all levels closely relied on the masses and sent a large number of cadres to go deep into the deep mountains that they usually never went to, together with the masses, to find pastures, and finally found many small pieces of pasture with water and grass, so that a large number of livestock survived the shortage of grass. Since liberation, the total number of various livestock in the county has increased more than tenfold, which is closely related to the fact that leaders at all levels are good at relying on the masses.
    Before liberation, Linchuan County in Jiangxi Province was a region with very serious domestic animal diseases. After liberation, the people of the county conscientiously implemented the policy of "prevention is more important than treatment," launched a mass-based epidemic prevention campaign, everyone engaged in epidemic prevention, and every team made covenants. The county established epidemic prevention organizations from top to bottom, forming an epidemic prevention network. Domestic animals have reached the requirement of "every head is injected, and every animal is immunized." The county's livestock has developed rapidly.
    The experience of all these units proves that whether or not we can adhere to self-reliance is the key to whether animal husbandry can be run well, and the key to self-reliance is to rely on the broad masses, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants and poor herdsmen. Only under the conditions of fully developing the high enthusiasm and rich creativity of the masses can self-reliance become an invincible force.
    Strive to Realize the Modernization of Animal Husbandry
    Since liberation, especially since communization, China's animal husbandry has shown an increasingly prosperous situation. In addition to the fundamental reason for the change in production relations, it is also because more and more regions, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, have begun fruitful struggles to realize the modernization of animal husbandry. The so-called realization of the modernization of animal husbandry, judging from the practical experience of the twelve typical units exhibited in the second room of the Animal Husbandry Pavilion, is to rely on the strength of the collective economy on the basis of realizing collectivization, so that the animal husbandry production process gradually realizes mechanization and semi-mechanization, carries out planned livestock breed improvement, establishes scientific feeding and management systems and good feed bases, and improves animal husbandry and veterinary institutions serving production. In short, it is to arm animal husbandry with modern science and technology.
    Chairman Mao taught: "Only when China thoroughly completes the socialist transformation in terms of the social and economic system, and also in terms of technology, uses machine operations in all departments and places where machine operations can be used, can the social and economic outlook be completely changed." The vast number of farmers and herdsmen in our country are precisely following Chairman Mao's instructions and continuing to fight heroically to realize the modernization of animal husbandry after realizing collectivization. Hulunbuir League and Xilingol League in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are very outstanding examples in this regard.
    Hulunbuir League and Xilingol League have endless, beautiful grasslands. But before liberation, the great grasslands not only did not bring happiness to the hundreds of thousands of Mongolian, Ewenki, and Daur ethnic groups, but instead subjected them to the cruel plunder and oppression of reactionary factions at home and abroad and feudal forces within the nation. At that time, the culture here was very backward, epidemics were frequent, the population continued to decline, and livestock declined year after year. After cooperativization and communization, the herdsmen of all ethnic groups here held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and relied on the strength of the collective economy to move towards the goal of modernizing animal husbandry step by step. They combined the utilization of grasslands with the construction of grasslands, dug earth wells, built machine wells, opened up 30,000 square kilometers of water-deficient grasslands, and established a large number of feed bases. While establishing agricultural machinery service stations with the help of the state, they vigorously carried out technological innovations and actively added mechanized and semi-mechanized machinery and tools. In order to adapt to the needs of improving feeding management, they built millions of square meters of fixed sheds and pens and a large number of mobile feeding equipment; they also bred a large number of fine breeds of livestock and established a large number of animal husbandry and veterinary institutions. In this way, the old backward outlook has been greatly changed, and animal husbandry has developed rapidly. Now, in this vast grassland area, compared with 1958, the total number of livestock has doubled, and the number of fine breeds and improved livestock has increased tenfold.
    Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, with eight counties and one city directly under its jurisdiction, is also a unit that has achieved remarkable results in modernizing animal husbandry. This is a pastoral unit that mainly raises sheep. Since communization, relying on the collective economy and the broad masses, they have adhered to scientific experiments, vigorously carried out fine-wool sheep breeding and sheep hybridization and improvement work, vigorously carried out basic construction, built water conservancy projects, built sheds and pens, and actively adopted machinery for shearing, grass cutting, feed production and feed processing. By 1965, the number of sheep had increased 1.6 times compared with 1949, of which improved sheep and fine-wool sheep accounted for 61.2% of the total number of sheep, and China's first fine-wool sheep breed—Xinjiang fine-wool sheep for both wool and meat—was bred. In the past sixteen years, it has sold 54.29 million catties of wool to the state and promoted more than 117,000 Xinjiang fine-wool sheep to 23 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, effectively supporting the sheep improvement work in various places.
    Yanchi County in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Jin County in Liaoning Province, Zhuji County in Zhejiang Province, Chaka Commune in Ulan County in Qinghai Province, and some communes and production teams in the suburbs of Shanghai and Beijing have also actively promoted modern science and technology in animal husbandry production and construction, promoting the development speed of animal husbandry and improving the quality of animal products. The common experience of these units is: the key to realizing the modernization of animal husbandry lies in overcoming the conservative thinking of being content with the status quo and developing the spirit of continuous revolution. Only in this way can we eliminate all kinds of obstacles on the road of progress and constantly win the victory of struggle.

    用革命精神办畜牧业
    ——记全国农业展览馆畜牧馆
    看完全国农业展览馆畜牧馆，得到一个强烈的印象：许多畜牧业获得了较快发展的先进典型单位，都是坚决按照毛主席关于农业和畜牧业必须同时并举的教导，用敢于革命和不断革命的精神，从不断实践中，认识客观规律，创造有利条件，把畜牧业生产一步一步地推向前进。
    这是畜牧馆展出的三十一个典型单位的共同经验，也是其它许多发展畜牧业取得显著成绩的地区的共同经验。
    在农牧并举的道路上前进
    畜牧业和农业，有着相互依存、相互促进的关系。农业从畜牧业取得耕畜和肥料，畜牧业靠农业提供饲料，因此，没有畜牧业的发展，农业就很难发展；不发展农业，畜牧业的发展也将受到限制。反过来说，它们当中任何一方的发展，都将为对方的发展创造有利的条件。
    解放以来，特别是人民公社化以来，全国各地已经有越来越多的地区的干部和群众，按照毛主席根据农业和畜牧业相互依存、相互促进的客观规律，所提出的农业和畜牧业必须同时并举的指示，敢于革命，敢于实践，走上了农牧并举的道路，促使农业和畜牧业大踏步地向前迈进。畜牧馆第一室展出的十九个单位，就是这种畜多、肥多、粮多的农牧结合、农牧并举的典型。
    养猪积肥，以猪促粮，这是广大农业区走向农牧并举的重要途径。广东省东莞县大朗公社黄草塱大队，前不靠山，后不傍水，解放前是个地瘦人穷的地方。解放后，他们在水利基本上过关的基础上，坚决执行粮猪并举方针，千方百计开辟饲料来源，积极发展养猪，做到队队办猪场，户户圈猪积肥，改造低产田。这样，近四年间，农业牧业全面发展，生产生活逐年提高。一九六五年，全大队平均每户养猪十头以上，比“全国农业发展纲要”规定的指标超出两倍，粮食平均亩产千斤以上，社员收入显著增加。
    类似这样平均每户养猪十头以上，粮食亩产达到或超过“全国农业发展纲要”的单位，还有湖南省长沙县大湖公社西塘大队，北京市顺义县木林公社陈各庄大队。
    繁殖更多的大牲畜，是促进农业生产的另一项重要措施。特别是那些水草丰富的地区，就更应该努力发展大牲畜，使之成为国家的大牲畜繁殖基地。河北省围场县，就在这方面做出了成绩。
    围场县是个半草原地区，群众历史上就有繁殖大牲畜的习惯。然而解放初期，全县仅有大牲畜三万一千多头。近几年来，尤其是一九六二年建立大牲畜繁殖基地以来，全县采取集中力量打歼灭战的办法，繁殖大牲畜。他们根据本县的特点，加强草原管理，全面规划，统筹安排，明确划分垦殖区、封禁区、放牧区，合理解决农、林、牧争地的矛盾。在牲畜的饲养管理方面，采取了改无人放牧为跟群放牧、改无槽混圈为有槽分圈、改圈内积肥为圈外积肥等一系列的改革措施，这样到一九六五年，圈存大牲畜十一万五千头，比一九六二年增加百分之二十六点九；粮食产量也提高百分之三十六点八；支援兄弟县、社大牲畜二万八千七百头。成绩非常突出。
    畜牧馆展出的其它一些典型单位，例如广西壮族自治区富川县、福建省长泰县陈巷公社，吉林省农安县万顺堡公社，黑龙江省富裕县富路公社等，也都有着大致相同的经验。这就有力地说明，农牧并举的思想一经为广大干部和群众所掌握，就会成为巨大的物质力量。它把农业和畜牧业一步又一步地推向全面发展的新境界。
    只有依靠群众才能自力更生
    办畜牧业，是靠向国家伸手，还是靠自力更生？毛主席早就说过：“我们的方针要放在什么基点上？放在自己力量的基点上，叫做自力更生。”这就是说，我们办一切事业，都要靠自力更生，办畜牧业，当然也是如此。
    可是，怎样才能自力更生呢？展出各单位的共同经验是：依靠广大农牧民群众。
    畜牧业，无论是生产也好、建设也好，总是离不开千千万万的农民和牧民的。没有广大群众，也就说不上发展畜牧业。当然，依靠群众，必须和向群众做思想政治工作结合起来。只有当广大农牧民有了社会主义觉悟以后，才能成为可以依靠的强大的力量。山西省永济县发展大牲畜的先进事迹，就是群众路线和自力更生革命精神的胜利。
    永济县是个既无草原、又无山坡的平川地区，发展畜牧业的条件是很差的。许多年来，人们受到条件的束缚，不敢去改变大牲畜严重不足的状况，每年都要到外地买牲口。一九六三年以前，每年都要从外地购进耕畜一千头左右。许多生产队还经常出现人推磨、人拉耧、人推水车的现象。从一九六三年起，这里的各级领导干部通过学习毛主席著作和党的政策，决心改变单纯依靠外援的办法，依靠群众，自力更生，自繁自养大牲畜。县委书记和其他领导干部，深入到群众中去调查研究，总结和推广了“固定基本繁殖母畜”的经验，大大调动了全县群众自繁自养大牲畜的积极性。于是，在近三年间，全县大牲畜迅速发展。一九六二年全县只有大牲畜二万七千一百八十一头，一九六五年底全县发展到三万四千九百三十头，净增长了百分之二十八点五。由于大牲畜的发展，肥料的增多，耕作细致，全县粮棉产量增长一倍以上。
    甘肃省阿克塞哈萨克族自治县的牧区多属荒漠草原，遇到天旱，牧草生长缓慢，严重影响放牧。一九六○年到一九六二年间，全县连续大旱，牧草严重不足，对畜牧业带来巨大的威胁。各级领导部门在大旱面前紧紧地依靠群众，派大批干部同群众一道深入到平常根本不去的深山中去，寻找草场，终于找到了许多有水有草的小片牧地，使大批牲畜度过了缺草的难关。这个县自解放以来，各种牲畜的总头数增长达十多倍，这和各级领导善于依靠群众，有着密切的联系。
    江西省临川县解放前是个家畜疫病十分严重的地区。解放后，全县人民认真贯彻执行“防重于治”的方针，大搞群众性的防疫运动，人人搞防疫，队队订公约，全县从上到下，层层建立了防疫机构，形成一个防疫网。家畜达到“头头注射，只只免疫”的要求。全县牲畜得到迅速发展。
    所有这些单位的经验都证明，能不能坚持自力更生，是畜牧业能不能办好的关键，而自力更生的关键是依靠广大群众，特别是依靠贫农、下中农和贫苦牧民。只有在充分发扬群众的高度积极性和丰富创造力的条件下，自力更生才能成为无往不胜的力量。
    为实现畜牧业现代化而斗争
    我国畜牧业在解放以来特别是公社化以来，出现了日趋繁荣的局面，除了生产关系改变这一根本原因外，还在于越来越多的地区，在党和毛主席的领导下，开始了为实现畜牧业现代化的卓有成效的斗争。所谓实现畜牧业的现代化，从畜牧馆第二室展出的十二个典型单位的实践经验来看，在实现集体化的基础上，依靠集体经济的力量，使畜牧业生产过程逐步实现机械化、半机械化，有计划地进行牲畜品种的改良，建立科学的饲养管理制度和良好的饲料基地，健全为生产服务的畜牧兽医机构。总之，是要用现代的科学技术武装畜牧业。
    毛主席教导说：“中国只有在社会经济制度方面彻底地完成社会主义改造，又在技术方面，在一切能够使用机器操作的部门和地方，通通使用机器操作，才能使社会经济面貌全部改观。”我国广大农民和牧民，正是按照毛主席这个指示，在实现集体化后，继续为实现畜牧业的现代化而英勇斗争的。内蒙古自治区的呼伦贝尔盟和锡林郭勒盟，就是这方面的十分出色的典型。
    呼伦贝尔盟和锡林郭勒盟，有着连绵无际的丰美的草原。可是在解放前，大好的草原不仅没有为十多万蒙古、鄂温克和达斡尔等民族带来幸福，反而使他们遭到了国内外反动派和民族内部封建势力的残酷掠夺和压迫。那时候，这里文化非常落后，疫病经常流行，人口不断减少，牲畜连年下降。合作化和公社化后，这里的各族牧民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，依靠集体经济的力量，一步紧似一步地向着畜牧业现代化的目标迈进。他们把利用草原和建设草原结合起来，打土井、建机井，开辟缺水草原三万平方公里，建立起大批的饲料基地。他们在国家帮助下建立牧业机械服务站的同时，大搞技术革新，积极添购机械化、半机械化机具，他们为了适应改善饲养管理的需要，建设了几百万平方米的固定性棚圈和数量也很大的可移动的饲养设备；他们还繁育了大批良种牲畜和建立了大批畜牧兽医机构。这样，就大大改变了旧日的落后面貌，使畜牧业迅速发展。现在，这一带辽阔的草原上，和一九五八年相比，牲畜总头数增加了一倍，良种和改良牲畜增加了十倍。
    新疆维吾尔自治区伊犁哈萨克自治州，直属八县一市，也是在畜牧业现代化方面卓有成效的单位。这是个以养羊为主的牧业单位。自公社化以来，依靠集体经济和广大群众坚持科学实验，大搞细毛羊育种和绵羊杂交改良工作，大搞基本建设，兴修水利，建设棚圈，并积极采用机械进行剪毛、打草，饲料生产和饲料加工。到一九六五年绵羊比一九四九年增长一点六倍，其中改良羊和细毛羊，占绵羊总数的百分之六十一点二，并育成了我国第一个细毛羊品种——新疆毛肉兼用细毛羊。十六年来，向国家交售羊毛五千四百二十九万斤，向二十三个省、市及自治区推广新疆细毛羊十一万七千余只，有力地支援了各地的绵羊改良工作。
    宁夏回族自治区盐池县，辽宁省金县，浙江省诸暨县，青海省乌兰县茶卡公社，以及上海、北京郊区的部分公社和生产队，也由于在畜牧业生产、建设中积极推行现代科学技术，促进了畜牧业的发展速度和提高了畜产品的质量。这些单位的共同经验是：实现畜牧业现代化的关键，在于克服安于现状的保守思想，发扬不断革命的精神。只有这样，才能排除前进道路上的种种障碍，不断地获得斗争的胜利。
