    Liberation Armed Forces Inflict Heavy Casualties on an American Infantry Division Company Near Saigon

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 12th – According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Liberation Armed Forces of Quang Nam, Gia Lai, and Quang Tri provinces in South Vietnam recently engaged in fierce close-range and night battles with enemy forces during counter-"sweeping" operations, annihilating two companies of U.S. aggressor troops, severely damaging one U.S. Army company, eliminating more than 300 puppet troops, and shooting down 11 enemy aircraft.

    On April 2, a battalion of U.S. Marines, landing from helicopters, launched a "sweeping" operation in Dai Hong commune, Dai Loc district, Quang Nam province, in three directions. The fighters of the Quang Nam Provincial Liberation Armed Forces engaged the enemy in close combat with bayonets and hand grenades, leaving the U.S. aggressor troops strewn across the battlefield, shattering the U.S. aggressor troops' "sweeping" operation, completely annihilating one U.S. Army company, killing and wounding a total of 250 people, shooting down two helicopters, and capturing a large quantity of weapons and military supplies.

    On March 30, in a counter-"sweeping" battle in the western region of Bo Le Me, Gia Lai province, the Liberation Armed Forces annihilated one company of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division, severely damaged another company, shot down seven helicopters and two B-57 bombers, and captured a batch of weapons and military supplies. On the same day, as enemy helicopters landed in the aforementioned area, the Liberation Armed Forces immediately surrounded the enemy and launched successive attacks. At night, the Liberation Armed Forces suddenly attacked the enemy's encampment, annihilating one U.S. Army company, and fiercely intercepted and severely damaged another U.S. Army company that came to their rescue.

    On March 27 and 28, the Liberation Armed Forces of Quang Tri Province shattered the "sweeping" operations conducted by two battalions of puppet troops against various coastal communes in Bei Feng district, eliminating more than 300 enemies and destroying four M-113 amphibious armored vehicles.

    Xinhua News Agency, 12th – Saigon Dispatch: The South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces severely attacked a company of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division near Ping Ye, 64 kilometers east of Saigon, in the afternoon and evening of the 11th. A U.S. military spokesman admitted that the company suffered heavy casualties.

    According to Western news agencies, the aggressor troops of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division have been conducting "sweeping" operations in this area in recent days. On the afternoon of the 11th, a company of this division was out on patrol when it was suddenly surrounded by the Liberation Armed Forces and subjected to fierce attacks from all directions with mortars and light weapons. Liberation Army soldiers then stormed into the enemy's position and engaged in bayonet fighting, throwing the U.S. troops into chaos and disarray. The battered U.S. Army company attempted to break through and "join up with another company of the 1st Infantry Division only 400 yards to the north," but was blocked by the Liberation Armed Forces' artillery fire. It was also reported that the Liberation Armed Forces shelled the puppet police station eight kilometers southwest of Saigon with mortars on the night of the 11th; and on the 9th and 10th, they continuously attacked the U.S.-puppet special forces camp 70 kilometers west of Saigon, causing significant casualties and losses to the enemy.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi – According to supplementary reports from the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, in the surprise attack on the Chu Lai U.S. Air Base in Quang Nam Province on the night of March 23, the South Vietnam Liberation Army, in addition to destroying 30 U.S. jet fighters and eliminating more than 200 U.S. aggressors, also damaged another 22 aircraft; destroyed two M-113 amphibious armored vehicles, destroyed eight U.S. barracks, and hit a gasoline depot.
