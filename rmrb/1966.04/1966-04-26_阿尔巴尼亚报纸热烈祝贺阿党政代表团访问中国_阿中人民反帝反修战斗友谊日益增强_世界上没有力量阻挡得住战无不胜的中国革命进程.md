    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, April 24th (Dispatch) The Albanian newspaper *Zëri i Popullit* published an editorial on the 24th entitled "The Militant Friendship Between Albania and China is Growing Stronger." The editorial stated that the visit of the Albanian Party and Government delegation to China is another powerful manifestation of the genuine militant friendship between our two peoples and another step in further strengthening the unity of the two parties and governments in defending Marxism-Leninism and fighting against our common enemies, the imperialists and revisionists.
    The editorial recounted the development of friendly relations between the two parties and countries since the founding of the People's Republic of China, stating that the friendly and cooperative relations between our two peoples were established by our two parties on the revolutionary principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. The visit of the Albanian people's envoys to fraternal China will make a new and very important contribution to elevating the friendship between the two peoples to a higher stage.
    The editorial said that a friend in need is a friend indeed. The Albanian people will never forget that at the critical moment when imperialism and Khrushchev's revisionism were implementing their barbaric blockade against small Albania, attempting to obstruct and sabotage our socialist construction by the most despicable means, the heroic Chinese people and their glorious Communist Party extended a powerful, fraternal hand of friendship and loyal alliance to us.
    The editorial stated that the fraternal friendship and revolutionary cooperation between Albania and China is a militant friendship tested in battle and strengthened in struggle. It is a profound friendship built on revolutionary principles, a friendship between militant peoples who, regardless of the size of their countries, stand on the front lines of a sacred common cause.
    The relationship between Albania and People's China is a brilliant example of a new type of relationship between fraternal socialist countries. This relationship is built on the correct principles of sincere respect and mutual assistance, on the basis of equality of rights and unreserved fraternal mutual aid. The Albanian people regard the Chinese people as their sincere friends and loyal allies.
    The editorial said that due to the victories achieved by the Chinese people on the socialist construction front, due to their firm stance in the struggle against U.S. imperialism, and due to their unremitting exposure of modern revisionism as the ideological and political agent of imperialism, China has become a shining example inspiring all the peoples and revolutionaries of the world.
    The editorial said that in practice, the Chinese people advocate equality for all countries, regardless of size; oppose big countries oppressing small countries; oppose a few powerful countries manipulating international affairs; and oppose any form of great-power chauvinism. China's international prestige is growing, and socialist China has now become a very powerful, advanced country with enormous international prestige, playing a huge role in the cause of world revolution and progress. Under the current circumstances, it is impossible to resolve important international issues without China's participation. China stands at the forefront of the struggle of the peoples of all countries against imperialism and modern revisionism.
    The editorial pointed out that because China is an insurmountable obstacle to the evil plans of imperialism and revisionism to achieve world hegemony, they hate China to the core, but the freedom-loving people of the world praise and respect it so much. Precisely because the Chinese giant unswervingly adheres to and resolutely defends the interests of the peace-loving people and exposes the policy of imperialism and revisionism cooperating to rule the world, the focus of the U.S. imperialists' "global strategy," aided by the Khrushchev revisionists, has shifted to China. However, neither nuclear blackmail nor the imperialist-revisionist collusion to "encircle" can intimidate the great Chinese people or make them deviate from the correct path of defending revolution and socialism.
    The editorial said that the Albanian people heartily congratulate this visit to China, which will surely make new contributions to enhancing and further prospering the friendship between the two peoples and to further developing the fraternal relations between our two parties; it will surely make new contributions to enhancing the militant unity between the two countries on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and to the interests of our two peoples, socialism and world peace.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, April 24th (Dispatch) The Albanian newspaper *Bashkimi* published an editorial on the 24th entitled "Further Strengthening the Fraternal Friendship and Militant Unity Between the Albanian and Chinese Peoples" on the occasion of the Albanian Party and Government delegation's visit to the People's Republic of China.
    The editorial said that the Albanian people highly appraise this visit and regard it as a new and important contribution to further strengthening the friendship and militant unity between our two peoples.
    The editorial said that the Albanian people have forged a pure, strong, and immortal friendship with the great Chinese people, a friendship forged by Marxist-Leninist parties. This friendship was born, strengthened, and developed in our common struggle for freedom, socialism, and peace, and against the U.S.-led imperialists and their fifth column, modern revisionism.
    The editorial said that the Albanian people wholeheartedly love their true friends and will never forget the fraternal, internationalist assistance given by the Chinese comrades in our good days and in our difficult days. The great Chinese people, the glorious Communist Party of China, and the Chinese government have faithfully defended and are defending the Albanian people and the Albanian Labor Party from the vile slander and attacks of modern revisionists. The Albanian people are forever grateful to the fraternal Chinese people, forever grateful to the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government, and believe that the friendship between our two peoples and the militant unity between our two parties will last forever.
    The editorial continued by stating that the relations and cooperation between our two countries, based on the revolutionary spirit and mutual benefit of the two peoples, are a vivid example of socialist countries implementing Marxist-Leninist doctrine. This relationship and cooperation are being strengthened day by day. The exchange of party and government delegations between our two countries will forever contribute to consolidating the militant friendship and fraternal relations between our two countries, two parties, and two peoples.
    The editorial said that the Albanian people are following with great attention the brilliant achievements made by the great Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong in the economic, political, and social spheres. Our people regard these victories as their own victories and as the victories of all revolutionary peoples of the world. Today, China has become a great economic power and an important political factor with influence in all international life. The prestige and reputation of the People's Republic of China are continuing to rise. The People's Republic of China steadfastly pursues a policy of opposing the aggression and war of imperialism and its servants. It actively and resolutely supports the revolutionary peoples struggling for freedom and national independence. The great Chinese people give great support and assistance to the heroic Vietnamese people and all other peoples who are engaged in a tit-for-tat struggle against bloody and brutal imperialism. The glorious Communist Party of China is a powerful international communist shock force that resolutely defends Marxism-Leninism from the vicious attacks of revisionism. It defends the socialist camp and the international communist and workers' movement from the attacks of imperialism and its servants. Precisely because of this, the enemies of Marxism-Leninism, socialism and peace attack the People's Republic of China, attack the Communist Party of China, slander her, and fabricate all kinds of rumors in order to discredit the far-sighted and peace-loving policies of the People's Republic of China. But in this vile and shameless anti-China activity, they have suffered a shameful defeat in the past, and they will always suffer a shameful defeat in the future. Now, the enemies of China are comprehensively plotting conspiracies, attempting to "encircle" and "isolate" China, and attempting to expand aggression against the People's Republic of China. As Comrade Shehu said, "To attempt to blockade and isolate China is like attempting to stop the howling wind and attempting to stop the bright sunshine." No force in the world can stop the invincible process of the Chinese revolution.
    The editorial concluded by saying that the Albanian delegation about to depart will bring to China the great friendly feelings, love, and respect that our people have for their comrades-in-arms. Therefore, the Albanian people wish the delegation a safe journey and success in fulfilling its faithful mission.

### 阿尔巴尼亚报纸热烈祝贺阿党政代表团访问中国  阿中人民反帝反修战斗友谊日益增强  世界上没有力量阻挡得住战无不胜的中国革命进程

    阿尔巴尼亚报纸热烈祝贺阿党政代表团访问中国
    阿中人民反帝反修战斗友谊日益增强
    世界上没有力量阻挡得住战无不胜的中国革命进程
    新华社地拉那二十四日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》二十四日发表题为《阿尔巴尼亚同中国的战斗友谊正在日益增强》的社论说，阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团访问中国，这是我们两国人民的真正战斗友谊的又一有力的表现，是进一步加强两党和两国政府在捍卫马克思列宁主义，反对共同敌人帝国主义者和修正主义的斗争中的团结的又一个步骤。
    社论叙述了自从中华人民共和国成立以来中阿两党和两国友好关系的发展后说，我们两国人民的友好合作关系是由我们两党在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的革命原则的基础上建立起来的。阿尔巴尼亚人民的使者对兄弟中国的访问将为把两国人民的友谊提到一个更高的阶段作出新的非常重要的贡献。
    社论说，患难识知己。阿尔巴尼亚人民永远不会忘记正当帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义对小小的阿尔巴尼亚实行它们的野蛮的封锁，企图以最卑鄙的手段阻挠和破坏我国社会主义建设的严重时刻，英雄的中国人民及其光荣的共产党，向我们伸出了朋友和忠实盟友的有力的、兄弟般的手。
    社论说，阿中的兄弟友谊和革命的合作是一种在战斗中得到考验，并在斗争中加强了的战斗友谊，这是建立在革命原则基础上的深厚的友谊，这是一种不分大国还是小国，站在神圣的共同事业的第一线进行斗争的战斗的人民的友谊。
    阿尔巴尼亚和人民中国之间的关系是兄弟的社会主义国家之间新型关系的光辉典范。这种关系是建立在真诚尊重和互助的正确原则之上、在权利平等、毫无保留的兄弟般的互相帮助基础之上的。阿尔巴尼亚人民把中国人民看作是自己的真诚的朋友和忠实的盟友。
    社论说，由于中国人民在社会主义建设战线上所取得的胜利，由于他们在反对美帝国主义的斗争中采取坚定的立场，由于他们坚持不懈地揭露作为帝国主义意识形态和政治上的代理人的现代修正主义，中国已经成为鼓舞全世界各国人民和所有革命者的光辉榜样。
    社论说，中国人民在实践中主张不分大国小国，一切国家一律平等；反对大国压迫小国，反对几个强国在国际问题上进行操纵，反对任何形式的大国沙文主义。中国的国际威望正在增长，社会主义中国现在已变成一个非常强大的、先进的、享有巨大国际威望的国家，在世界革命和进步的事业中起着巨大的作用。在当前情况下，没有中国参加就不可能解决重要的国际问题。中国站在各国人民反对帝国主义和现代修正主义斗争的最前线。
    社论指出，因为中国是帝国主义和修正主义实现它们建立世界霸权的罪恶计划的不可逾越的障碍，它们对中国恨之入骨，但是全世界爱好自由的人民又是那么称颂它和尊敬它。正因为中国巨人毫不动摇地坚持和坚决保卫爱好和平人民的利益，揭露帝国主义和修正主义合作统治世界的政策，所以得到赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的帮助的美帝国主义的“全球战略”的重心，就转移到中国的身上。但是，原子讹诈也好，帝国主义修正主义合谋“包围”也好，都不能吓倒伟大的中国人民，不能使他们离开保卫革命和社会主义的正确道路。
    社论说，阿尔巴尼亚人民衷心祝贺这次对中国的访问必将为增强和进一步繁荣两国人民的友谊，进一步发展我们两党之间的兄弟般的关系，作出新的贡献；必将为增强两国在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的战斗团结，为我们两国人民的利益，社会主义与世界和平作出新的贡献。
    新华社地拉那二十四日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》二十四日就阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团访问中华人民共和国，发表题为《进一步加强阿中两国人民之间的兄弟友谊和战斗团结》的社论。
    社论说，阿尔巴尼亚人民高度评价这次访问，并把它看作是进一步加强我们两国人民之间的友谊和战斗团结的新的重要贡献。
    社论说，阿尔巴尼亚人民同伟大的中国人民结成了纯洁、坚强和不朽的友谊，结成了为马克思列宁主义政党所锤炼的友谊。这种友谊是我们在争取自由、社会主义与和平，在反对以美国为首的帝国主义者和他们的第五纵队现代修正主义的共同斗争中诞生、加强和发展的。
    社论说，阿尔巴尼亚人民全心全意地热爱自己的真正朋友，并永远不会忘记中国同志在我们顺利的日子和困难的日子里所给予的兄弟般的、国际主义的援助。伟大的中国人民，光荣的中国共产党和中国政府，忠实地保卫了并正在保卫着阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党免受现代修正主义者的卑鄙诬蔑和攻击。阿尔巴尼亚人民永远感激兄弟的中国人民，永远感激中国共产党和中国政府，并且相信我们两国人民的友谊，我们两党的战斗团结将万古长青。
    社论接着说，我们两国建立在两国人民的革命精神和互利基础上的关系和合作，是社会主义国家间执行马克思列宁主义学说的生动榜样。这种关系与合作日益得到加强。我们两国之间交换的党政代表团永远有助于巩固我们两国、两党和两国人民之间的战斗友谊和兄弟关系。
    社论说，阿尔巴尼亚人民以巨大的注意力注视着伟大的中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的领导下，在经济、政治和社会方面所取得的辉煌成就。我国人民把这些胜利看作是自己的胜利，看作是世界所有革命人民的胜利。中国今天变成了一个伟大的经济强国，成为在一切国际生活中具有影响的重要政治因素。中华人民共和国的威信和声誉正在继续提高。中华人民共和国坚持不渝地奉行反对帝国主义及其仆从的侵略和战争的政策。它积极并坚决地支持为争取自由和民族独立而斗争的革命人民。伟大的中国人民给予英雄的越南人民以及所有与血腥残暴的帝国主义进行针锋相对的斗争的其他各国人民以巨大支持和帮助。光荣的中国共产党是坚决保卫马克思列宁主义免受修正主义恶毒攻击的强大的国际共产主义突击队，她保卫着社会主义阵营以及国际共产主义和工人运动免受帝国主义及其仆从的攻击。正因为如此，马克思列宁主义、社会主义与和平的敌人攻击中华人民共和国，攻击中国共产党，对她进行诬蔑，捏造各种各样的谣言，以便诋毁中华人民共和国富有远见性的和爱好和平的政策。但是在这种卑鄙无耻的反华活动中，他们过去遭到了可耻的失败，今后将永远遭到可耻的失败。现在，中国的敌人正在全面策划阴谋，企图“包围”和“孤立”中国，企图扩大对中华人民共和国的侵略。谢胡同志说过，“企图封锁和孤立中国，就如同企图阻挡呼啸劲吹的大风和企图阻挡光辉夺目的阳光一样”。世界上没有力量阻挡得住战无不胜的中国革命进程。
    社论最后说，即将出发的阿尔巴尼亚代表团将把我国人民对战友怀有的伟大友好感情、热爱和尊敬带到中国。因此阿尔巴尼亚人民祝代表团一路平安并在完成自己的忠实使命中取得成就。
