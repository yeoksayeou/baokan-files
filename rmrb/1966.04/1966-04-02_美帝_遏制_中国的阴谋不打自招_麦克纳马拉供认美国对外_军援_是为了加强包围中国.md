    Xinhua News Agency, March 31st, Washington Dispatch: U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara, while testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the U.S.'s 1967 fiscal year "military assistance" plan on the 30th, emphasized the need to intensify aggression against Asia, especially directing the main spearhead of aggression at China, and strengthening the encirclement of China through "military assistance" to "free nations" on the "periphery of mainland China."

    McNamara began by saying that out of the total of $917 million in U.S. "military assistance" for the 1967 fiscal year, 37 percent, or $387 million, will be used for the Far East region, especially Southeast Asia, not including "military assistance" to the South Vietnamese puppet clique. He also said that the developments in Southeast Asia, especially Laos and Thailand, may require more funds than currently requested.

    McNamara once again issued anti-China clamor while justifying the U.S.'s policy of hostility towards China and the Asian people. He said that the U.S. will spend particularly heavily in the Far East because the "economic and military strength" of the U.S.'s "allies" there is "extremely unbalanced compared to the economic and military strength of Communist China," and these countries or regions are "facing the threat of Communist China." He shamelessly said, "Therefore, the strength of the United States, our presence, our will and obligation to defend them, are extremely important factors for stability in the Far East."

    McNamara said that the "military assistance" given by the U.S. to the South Vietnamese puppet regime, Laos, Thailand, the Philippines, the Chiang Kai-shek gang, and the South Korean puppet regime, which are located on the "periphery of mainland China," will be used to maintain their "considerable armies" to resist so-called "foreign aggression" and "strengthen their ability to maintain domestic security."

    McNamara's testimony shows that the U.S. attaches great importance to the position that Thailand occupies in the U.S.'s strategy of expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam and encircling China. He said, "Due to its size and strategic location on the (Asian) mainland, Thailand is a very important country in Southeast Asia for the United States."

    McNamara's testimony also shows that one of the purposes of U.S. "military assistance" is to drive its puppets to serve the U.S.'s aggressive policies. He praised the South Korean puppet regime for sending 20,000 accomplice troops to assist the U.S. in its aggression against Vietnam, saying that South Korea "provides a vivid example of how we and our allies continue to benefit from the military assistance program."

    McNamara also stated that the U.S. will continue to occupy China's territory of Taiwan and continue to provide arms and weapons to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.

    美帝“遏制”中国的阴谋不打自招
    麦克纳马拉供认美国对外“军援”是为了加强包围中国
    新华社三十一日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国防部长麦克纳马拉三十日在众议院外交委员会就美国一九六七财政年度的“军事援助”计划作证时，强调要加紧对亚洲的侵略，特别是把侵略的主要矛头指向中国，通过对“大陆中国边沿”的“自由国家”的“军事援助”来强化对中国的包围。
    麦克纳马拉一开头就说，在一九六七财政年度总数九亿一千七百万美元的美国“军事援助”中，百分之三十七，即三亿八千七百万美元将用于远东地区，特别是东南亚，对南越傀儡集团的“军事援助”还不包括在内。他还说，东南亚、特别是老挝和泰国的局势发展可能除了目前的要求以外还需要更多的费用。
    麦克纳马拉在为美国敌视中国和亚洲人民的政策辩解时又一次发出反华叫嚷。他说，美国在远东花的钱将特别多，因为美国在那里的“盟友”所拥有的“经济和军事力量同共产党中国的经济和军事力量极不平衡”，这些国家或地区正“面临共产党中国的威胁”。他厚颜无耻地说，“因此，美国的力量，我们的驻扎，我们保卫它们的意志和义务，就成为远东地区稳定的极重要的因素。”
    麦克纳马拉说，美国给予处于“大陆中国边沿”的南越傀儡政权，老挝、泰国、菲律宾、蒋匪帮和南朝鲜傀儡政权的“军事援助”将用来维持它们“数目相当大的军队”，以抵抗所谓“外来侵略”和“加强它们维持国内安全的能力”。
    麦克纳马拉的证词表明，美国十分重视泰国在美国扩大侵越战争和包围中国的战略中所占的地位。他说，“由于它的面积和在（亚洲）大陆的战略地位，泰国对美国来说是东南亚的一个十分重要的国家”。
    麦克纳马拉的证词还表明，美国“军事援助”的目的之一是要驱策它的傀儡为美国侵略政策效劳。他夸奖南朝鲜傀儡政权为美国侵略越南出了两万名帮凶军，说什么南朝鲜“为我们和我们的盟国继续从军事援助计划中得到好处提供了一个生动的例子。”
    麦克纳马拉还表示，美国要继续霸占中国的领土台湾，继续对蒋介石匪帮提供军火武器。
