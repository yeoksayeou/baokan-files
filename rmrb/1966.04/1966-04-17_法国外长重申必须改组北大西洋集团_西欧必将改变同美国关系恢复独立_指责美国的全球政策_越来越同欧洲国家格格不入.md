    According to Xinhua News Agency, Paris, April 15th, French Foreign Minister Couve de Murville accused the United States on the 14th of having a global policy that is “increasingly incompatible with European countries.” He emphasized that Western Europe's "restoration of independence from the United States is inevitable and good for everyone."

    While speaking at the French National Assembly's foreign policy debate, de Murville emphasized that France's decision to withdraw from the military "integration" of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was not a military issue, but "primarily a political issue... Ultimately, it is about changing the relationship between the United States and Europe."

    He pointed out: France remains "loyal to this alliance," but "with the two main headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization located in France, along with all other headquarters, communication networks, airports, and logistics systems belonging to the American army, the U.S. military in fact enjoys extraterritoriality." He added that although the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had not prevented France from implementing its own policies in the past, "the question now is not whether to do what one wants to do, but to avoid being forced to do what one does not want to do."

    De Murville pointed out that the current form of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should also be changed because the current situation in Europe is different from that of fifteen years ago, because "the US-Soviet confrontation is narrowing."

    De Murville said that the French government had long stated that it would state its position in the spring of 1966. He said that fundamental reform of the organization through negotiation was merely "wishful thinking." Since de Gaulle took office in 1958, there have been eight years of "dialogue with the deaf." De Gaulle has consistently criticized military "integration," while the American response has always been that military "integration" institutions should be strengthened rather than weakened.

    De Murville spoke about France's relationship with West Germany, saying that France is willing to hold negotiations with West Germany on the issue of the continued stationing of French troops in West Germany, which France intends to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization headquarters on July 1st.

    法国外长重申必须改组北大西洋集团
    西欧必将改变同美国关系恢复独立
    指责美国的全球政策“越来越同欧洲国家格格不入”
    据新华社巴黎十五日电　法国外交部长德姆维尔十四日指责美国的全球政策“越来越同欧洲国家格格不入”。他强调，西欧“恢复对美国的独立是不可避免的，对大家都是好事”。
    德姆维尔在法国国民议会外交政策辩论中发言时强调，法国决定退出北大西洋公约组织军事“一体化”，不是一个军事问题，“主要是政治问题……归根结蒂，就是改变美国和欧洲之间的关系。”
    他指出：法国是仍然“忠于这个联盟”的，但是“在法国设有北大西洋公约组织的两个主要司令部，还设有属于美军的其他所有司令部、通讯网、飞机场和后勤体系，而事实上，美军的这一切都享有治外法权”。他还说，虽然北大西洋公约组织过去没有妨碍法国执行自己的政策，但是“现在的问题并不是能不能作自己希望做的事，而是不要被迫作自己不希望做的事情。”
    德姆维尔指出，目前形式的北大西洋公约组织之所以应当改变，还由于目前欧洲局势不同于十五年前的欧洲局势，因为“美苏对抗正在缩小”。
    德姆维尔说，法国政府早就说过要在一九六六年春天表明它的立场。他说，通过谈判来对这个组织进行根本改革只是“空想”，自从戴高乐一九五八年执政以来，已经进行了八年“聋子式的对话”。戴高乐一直批评军事“一体化”，而美国人的答复总是，军事“一体化”机构还要加强，而不是削弱。
    德姆维尔谈到法国同西德的关系说，法国愿意就法国打算在七月一日自北大西洋公约组织司令部撤出的法军继续留驻西德问题同西德举行谈判。（附图片）
