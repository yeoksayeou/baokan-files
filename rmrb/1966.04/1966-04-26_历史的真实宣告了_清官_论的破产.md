    Historical Truth Declares the Bankruptcy of the "Upright Official" Theory
    Jiangxi Province Ganzhou Special District Philosophy and Social Sciences Federation Investigation Team

    Abstract: The on-site investigation in Xingguo County clarified several historical facts about Hai Rui's tenure as magistrate in the area, helping us to further understand Hai Rui's true face and thoroughly declare the bankruptcy of the "upright official" theory. In the short year or so that Hai Rui was in Xingguo, he used insidious and vicious methods to suppress several peasant uprisings, and his hands were stained with the blood of revolutionary people. The landlord class praised Hai Rui to the skies. In the minds of the people, Hai Rui was the political representative of the landlord class, a particularly vicious one among the landlords.

    Comrade Wu Han and other proponents of the "upright official" theory used Hai Rui as a model, repeatedly extolling the merits of "upright officials" and striving to win historical status for them. Their argument is based solely on historical books written by feudal literati according to the interests of the ruling class. Does this argument conform to historical truth? To clarify the rights and wrongs, we recently organized some comrades to conduct an on-site investigation in Xingguo County (where Hai Rui served as magistrate for more than a year from 1563 to 1564). Through interviews with the masses and research of local documents, we have initially found clues to Hai Rui's activities in Xingguo. These clues help us clarify some historical truths and declare the bankruptcy of the "upright official" theory.

          The Truth About "Serving the People"

    When Hai Rui arrived in Xingguo, it was a time when the local peasant masses were subjected to increasingly cruel oppression and exploitation. "Taxes and levies increased daily, and many people fled," outside the city, every thirty or twenty li, there were only "scattered dwellings, less than ten families," "the population dwindling, the villages desolate."① Some peasants had already risen up to resist and organized rebel armies. Appointed at a time of sharp class contradictions and fierce class struggle, Hai Rui, according to records, did these things: repaired "Wan Song Dam," reclaimed wasteland and resettled immigrants, measured fields, and "equalized taxes." Now, let's look at the truth about these things.

    Wan Song Dam, also known as Chun Kou Dam, is located at the bend of the Lian River south of Xingguo city, about five li long. It is said that the original dam was built by Lu Ning, the Xingguo magistrate before Hai Rui. After Hai Rui arrived in Xingguo, he repaired it and asked the people to plant thousands of pine trees on the dam, called "Hai Pine," and the dam was later called "Hai Song Dam."

    According to the *Lianshui Zhilin*, shortly after Hai Rui left, the peasants planted sugar cane on the dam, "and the dam was submerged and no longer existed." During the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty, Huang Weigui, the magistrate of Xingguo, forced the peasants to repair it again, but the peasants rose up in resistance and "did not immediately start work." Huang Weigui used cruel means to "personally supervise the work," and the dam was barely repaired. But "when Huang left, the people breached it again," and the dam was leveled again.② From these records, we can see that there was a fierce struggle over the construction of Wan Song Dam. The peasants were firmly opposed, while Hai Rui and other feudal officials were very fond of this project. What is the reason for this?

    The dam was harmful and not beneficial to the peasants. Because after the dam was built, it hindered the rational irrigation of farmland inside the dam. *Lianshui Zhilin* explains that the peasants breached the dam in order to irrigate dozens of hectares of sweet potato fields inside the dam. After the dam was built, it was easy to cause waterlogging disasters inside the dam. Local people reported that after this section of the dam was built, whenever it rained, the water inside the dam could not be drained, and waterlogging disasters occurred.

    The landlords were very supportive of the dam construction. Because Hai Rui repaired the "Wan Song Dam" mainly for "feng shui." It is said that if there was no forest to block the "water mouth" at the bend of the Lian River, the "fortune" of the wealthy families in the city would flow away. Wang Rui, who came to Xingguo as magistrate forty years after Hai Rui, said in his *Temple Record of Lord Zhongjie Hai*: "Lord Hai planted pine trees at Chun Kou Dam to cultivate the atmosphere."③ Zhang Canlu of the Qing Dynasty also wrote a *Wan Song Song* for this, the preface of the song saying: "The geomancers said that the land should be high and towering, Lord Hai, you virtuous one, came to be magistrate, and once ordered the people to plant thousands of pine trees to act as such." One couplet in the song is: "The predecessors planted this to accumulate deep meaning, the atmosphere is completely gathered, the screen is winding."④ The landlord class chose "feng shui," chose "auspicious land," and begged the illusory gods, dreaming of a more cruel plunder of the peasants. Hai Rui's repair of Wan Song Dam was precisely to cater to this mentality of the landlord class, in order to gain their support and support, colluding and using each other.

    In addition, Hai Rui's purpose in repairing the dam was also to gain fame and reputation for himself. Planting pine trees was to leave his name in Xingguo. A similar thing is: before leaving Xingguo, he also asked the peasants to plant some willow trees by a small stream near "Wan Song Dam"—Cheng River—called "Lord Hai Willow." Planting some willow trees by a small stream is of no significance to production, and like the planting of pine trees at Wan Song Dam, it was just Hai Rui's means of gaining fame and reputation, and it was the ladder he built for himself to climb up.

    This is the true history of "Wan Song Dam." To build such a dam more than ten zhang wide, I don't know how many peasants were deprived of their land, I don't know how many peasants paid uncompensated labor for the benefit of the landlords. After the dam was built and the pine trees were planted, the peasants' production was damaged, and their lives became more difficult; the landlords obtained "auspicious land" and were satisfied. And Hai Rui left his name in the bloody history, winning the praise of feudal literati. In this chorus of praise, there is also a song of praise from the proponents of the "upright official" theory: Hai Rui "served the people."

    Regarding the reclamation of wasteland and resettlement of immigrants, the nature is even clearer. Local people reported that Hai Rui did indeed let the peasants reclaim some wasteland in the northwest of the county, but after the wasteland was reclaimed, Hai Rui announced: this piece of land is a reward for seeking fame—scholars, those who seek fame can get it. Yu Fugui, an 82-year-old man in the suburbs of Xingguo city, said: "Hai Rui only dealt with the rich and famous, and developed some wasteland, but we poor people have no share." The land that thousands of peasants had worked so hard to reclaim suddenly fell into the hands of landlords and gentry. Landlord class intellectuals who gained officialdom and wealth, with the help of Hai Rui, seized this newly opened land, while the peasants who reclaimed the land became new tenants. Reclamation was an extremely cruel method of plunder and exploitation of the peasants that Hai Rui had painstakingly devised for the benefit of the landlord class.

    This is not the ultimate purpose of Hai Rui's reclamation. The ultimate purpose of reclaiming wasteland and resettling immigrants was to suppress peasant uprisings and consolidate the reactionary regime of the entire landlord class.

    In the *Eight Proposals for Xingguo*, Hai Rui clearly stated: If the reclamation and resettlement of immigrants can be realized, "in a few years, there will be no surplus land in southern Jiangxi, and the villages will be connected, which can contain the bandits of the various nests. There will be no surplus people in Ji'an and other places, and there will be no worries about escaping and becoming bandits without food and clothing."⑤ In a word, the reclamation and resettlement of immigrants was to further bind the peasants to the land, giving them the lowest living conditions, allowing them to merely maintain their lives and work for the landlords, so as not to "force them to Liang Mountain." And for the peasants who had already risen up in resistance, this played a restrictive and suppressive role. Look, how thoroughly Hai Rui planned for the long-term rule of the landlord class! All his measures directly targeted the peasant masses; and some of our "upright official" theorists are still cheering for his measures, saying that he was "serving the people"!

    Measuring fields and "equalizing taxes" is also a "merit" of Hai Rui that proponents of the "upright official" theory have repeatedly promoted. After Hai Rui arrived in Xingguo, he did indeed hurriedly measure the fields. But who was this for? As long as one piece of material is cited, the answer can be obtained. According to Zhang Shangyuan's *Biography of Hai Rui*, before Hai Rui arrived, Xingguo "county regulations stipulated that the richest grain households should be the 'pillar heads,' and all public and private expenses were taken from them, and this was abolished at this time."⑥ Originally, the purpose of measuring the fields was to reduce the burden on the landlord class and further add the portion of taxes they should bear to the peasants. Moreover, in the process of measuring the fields, landlords and gentry bribed village officials, engaged in private fraud, and as a result, many lands of the landlords became black lands exempt from taxes, and the taxes were spread to the peasants. The result of the field measurement was an even more brutal exploitation of the peasants.

    Hai Rui followed this practice throughout his life. Even when he later lived at home, he still offered suggestions to the local officials in his hometown, advocating that the portion of taxes that Han landlords should bear be added to the poor peasants of fraternal ethnic groups through field measurements. After the local officials followed his example in measuring the fields, he wrote a letter praising: "Now the descendants of the people have been able to divide their grain to the Li and lighten it, so even the rich families are privately and publicly calling it convenient."⑦

    To describe the measurement of fields to reduce the taxes of landlords and increase the burden on peasants as "beneficial to the peasants" and "serving the people," isn't this turning black and white upside down?

    The above few things show that Hai Rui everywhere proceeded from the interests of the landlord class, and how to help the landlords oppress and exploit the peasants was the starting point of his policy measures. This is the historical truth. He simply ignored the life and death of the peasants, so where did the "serving the people" come from? In Hai Rui's eyes, the peasants who dared to rise up in resistance were "bandits," "thieves," and "reckless and unruly people"; the peasants who had not yet risen up in resistance were the natural cattle and horses of the landlord class, so where did the "sympathy" and "love for the people like children" come from? When he was in Xingguo, he wrote a poem *Comforting the Farmers*, slandering the peasants as: "Working without complaint, running like horses, greedy and incompetent, clumsy like doves."⑧ In the eyes of this landlord, the peasant masses are just cattle and horses who "work without complaint," like clumsy "doves," a group of natural slaves. Look, is he standing on the side of the landlord class or on the side of the peasants? Isn't it obvious?!

    "Serving the people" is the great compassionate halo that proponents of the "upright official" theory have added to Hai Rui's head. And Hai Rui himself, on the question of how to treat the peasants, was very clear. Proceeding from his landlord class nature, he instinctively realized that he and the peasants were sworn enemies who could not coexist. He scolded some of his colleagues who did not dare to fight the peasant rebel army to the end, saying: "Scholars are pedantic and far removed from affairs, and are useless. There are those who hold crowning ceremonies when thieves are approaching the city; there are those who have no plans, hold on to loyalty and righteousness, and bow their heads to be killed. The sages never had such principles, never had such loyalty and righteousness."⑨ It is really indignation filling his chest, rubbing his fists, and being irreconcilable with the peasants. The "upright official" theorists carefully read this passage from Hai Rui, and they can sober up their minds.

      A Executioner Whose Hands Are Stained With the Blood of Revolutionary People

    Viewing the peasants as irreconcilable enemies, Hai Rui's class nature was most fully exposed in the face of the peasant uprising. In his short year or so in Xingguo, he used insidious and vicious methods to suppress many mountain stronghold peasant uprisings, and his hands were stained with the blood of revolutionary people.

    According to records, from the early Tang Dynasty to the late Qing Dynasty, peasant uprisings in Xingguo continued one after another. The ruling classes of the past dynasties, some used bloody massacres, some used insidious methods such as deception, division, and softening, and suppressed one peasant revolution after another. According to *Lianshui Zhilin*, in the 40th year of Jiajing (the year before Hai Rui came to Xingguo as magistrate), the county seat of Xingguo was besieged by the peasant rebel army, and the landlord bureaucrats could not deal with it. Later, many soldiers were sent from above to make the "nest thieves" "defeated and out of the territory."⑩ Hai Rui absorbed the historical lessons of the ruling class in suppressing peasant uprisings, and also used very despicable deceptive tricks to slaughter the revolutionary peasants of Xingguo.

    Local people said that when Hai Rui took office, there were four large mountain stronghold peasant uprisings in Xingguo, namely: Ya Jing (Yashi Village, in today's Zhangmu Commune), Li Sheng (Li Po Village, in today's Jiangbei Commune), Zhang Fu (Zhangshi Village, in today's Changgong Commune), and Bao Xian (Baoshi Village, in today's Chongxian Commune). (Another saying is eighteen camps, but the above four camps are the main ones.) Their主張 were to help the poor and the weak, rob the rich and help the poor, and specifically attack the landlords, gentry, and wealthy merchants in the vicinity, without moving the property of the surrounding peasant masses. The landlords, wealthy merchants hated them to the bone, while the peasant masses were very supportive, often gathering money and grain to help the camps when they encountered difficulties. After Hai Rui arrived in Xingguo, he learned that the strength of each mountain stronghold was very strong, and the cliffs were steep and the terrain was dangerous. Hai Rui had only 252 soldiers under his command?, and he could not suppress them by force. Therefore, he formulated a policy of "suppression and appeasement." According to some predecessors, Hai Rui once disguised himself as a fortune teller and went up the mountain to speak sweet words in front of the mountain stronghold king to gain the trust of the mountain stronghold king. So, he and the mountain stronghold king swore blood as an oath and became brothers, and learned about the strength of each camp. Later, he sent someone to Wu Baipeng, the Nangan Supervisor of Ganzhou Prefecture, to ask for troops, pre-arranged a trap, and invited the mountain stronghold kings down the mountain to pay birthday greetings to his mother in the name of celebrating his mother's birthday. Some mountain stronghold kings were suspicious of Hai Rui and refused to go down the mountain. Hai Rui swore to the sky in front of them and said: "If you harm people, you will be split into four pieces." So, they believed it to be true and were tricked down the mountain. As soon as they arrived in the county seat, they were arrested by the troops that Hai Rui had ambushed in advance. At that time, some mountain stronghold kings questioned Hai Rui: "Why don't you keep your promise?" Hai Rui cunningly took out a rice measure and split the rice measure into four pieces with a knife, saying: "This is what I mean by 'body (measure) split into four pieces.'" As a result, he killed all these mountain stronghold kings. Another mountain stronghold king named Song Naideng, Hai Rui had long realized that this person was shrewd, capable, strong, and brave, and could not deceive him, so he shamelessly adopted the method of a beauty trap. He falsely claimed one of his maids as his daughter and married her to Song Naideng to gain his trust. When the trick succeeded, he used the relationship between father-in-law and son-in-law to invite Song Naideng down the mountain to pay his birthday greetings. When Song Naideng walked to "Lazy Man Bridge" south of the city, suddenly ambush soldiers rose up from all sides, and this mountain stronghold king was also captured and killed. Hai Rui lured and killed the mountain stronghold kings and hung their heads on the city gate for "public display." The landlords, gentry, and wealthy merchants of the whole county hung red lanterns to celebrate, and Hai Rui also made great contributions because of this.

    Although this legend passed down from generation to generation by the local peasant masses differs in some details, the fact that the peasant uprising leaders of Xingguo were lured and killed is consistent. This shows that in the minds of the peasant masses, Hai Rui is an extremely insidious and cunning executioner. The following written materials also powerfully prove this point.

    According to *Lianshui Zhilin*, in the year before Hai Rui came to Xingguo, a large-scale peasant uprising occurred in Xingguo. Although "in the Renxu year, the edict was issued to assemble 200,000 troops and divide them into seven outposts to suppress them"?, it was impossible to "suppress" them all. In the *Eight Proposals for Xingguo*, Hai Rui stated that one of his purposes in advocating the reclamation of wasteland and the resettlement of immigrants was to "contain the bandits of the various nests." *Xingguo County Chronicles* quotes *Ganzhou Prefecture Chronicles* (Xie Chronicles) as saying that after Hai Rui arrived in Xingguo, he "offered rewards for capturing thieves"?. This proves that when Hai Rui took office in Xingguo, there were indeed peasant uprisings in Xingguo, and Hai Rui did try to suppress them in every possible way.

    According to *Lianshui Zhilin·Biography of Lü Yun*, Xingguo "Lü Yun, ... a student of the county, ... during the Jiajing period, he was once hired by Wu Dufufu Baipeng on the recommendation, and pointed out strategies to pacify the three nests of Dongguan"? The three nests refer to the larger-scale peasant rebel armies that were active in northern Guangdong and southern Jiangxi at that time. The peasant uprising in Xingguo was a part connected with it. (According to the masses, some of the leaders in the peasant rebel army's camp were from Guangdong.) Wu Baipeng was the Nangan Supervisor to whom Hai Rui hurriedly submitted the *Eight Proposals for Xingguo* after he arrived in Xingguo, proposing to "contain the bandits of the various nests." He patrolled and appeased Nangan in 1563 and was an executioner who suppressed the peasant uprisings in southern Jiangxi and Guangdong. Huang Bingshi mentioned in *Biography of Lord Zhongjie Hai* that Hai Rui "was promoted to the Ministry of Revenue's Secretary for his meritorious service in rewarding the army."? The so-called "rewarding the army" refers to rewarding Wu Baipeng's officers and soldiers who suppressed the peasant uprising. From these materials, we can see that at that time, the entire landlord class of southern Jiangxi and its representatives acted jointly to suppress the peasant uprising. From the supervisor's office to the landlord class intellectuals, some offered advice and suggestions, and some dispatched troops and generals. Hai Rui's suppression of the peasant uprising in Xingguo was only a component of this suppression activity and was the direct commander of this component.

    There is also a piece of circumstantial evidence, which is Hai Rui's own remarks. Until Hai Rui returned to his hometown, he never stopped suppressing peasant uprisings throughout his life. When Hai Rui lived in his hometown, he did not have an army in his hands and could not personally carry out bloody massacres, so he offered advice to local officials and wrote to Chen Nanchuan, teaching him how to massacre the peasants who rose up in resistance: "The sea bandits are different from the mountain bandits. The mountain bandits have nests, and the sea bandits have no fixed place. Once a large army gathers, they will drift away. Therefore, those who are good at attacking thieves by the sea do not compare with the thieves in terms of numbers or size, but only wait for their convenience, ... lure them and wait for them, using every possible means."? This "luring them and waiting for them, using every possible means" is the best confession of Hai Rui's luring and killing of peasant uprising leaders in Xingguo. What other proof is needed?

    Before us stands an image of an insidious, cunning, hypocritical executioner with blood on his hands. Is such an image not the historical truth, while the false Hai Rui fabricated by the ruling class who "attacked the powerful landlords" and "redressed the grievances of the peasants" is the historical truth instead?

    All oppressive classes, in order to maintain their rule, must adopt two-pronged counterrevolutionary policies. The so-called "suppression and appeasement" policy adopted by Hai Rui in order to maintain the rule of the feudal landlord class is not also this two-pronged counterrevolutionary policy?

    I don't know how many revolutionary peasants sacrificed under the executioner's knife, but the "upright official" theorists portray such an executioner as a "guardian" who protects the interests of the peasants and a "savior" of the peasants. Isn't this deliberately distorting historical facts and helping the feudal ruling class?

    Below, we ask the "upright official" theorists to take a look at how the dead class sang and beautified his loyal son and good son Hai Rui, and how the people vividly describe Hai Rui. Take a look, compare, and see clearly who you are in tune with.

    A Loyal Minister in the Eyes of the Landlords, a Beast in the Eyes of the Peasants

    In order to paralyze the awakening of the peasant class consciousness and to deceive the broad masses of the people, the landlord class always gives its own interests a universal form, saying that its interests are the common interests of all classes. On the issue of "upright officials," they are playing the same trick, fabricating a so-called "upright official" that embodies class harmony, and then portraying it as a "benefactor" who bestows blessings on all classes.

    Comrade Wu Han's *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* ends with a poem: "The weather is cold and the ground is frozen, the wind is howling, and there are thousands of thoughts of departure, Father Hai cannot be kept from returning to the south, and thousands of families burn incense to offer him as a living Buddha," which is a concentrated reproduction of this traditional technique.

    Are "upright officials" really appointed by the people? Do the people really miss and cherish "upright officials" so much? No, this is a fabrication and a distortion. "Upright officials" are appointed by the landlord class, and only the landlord class misses and cherishes him.

    After Hai Rui died, Gong Daoli, the vice-envoy of Lingbei, issued an order to build "Lord Hai Temple" in Xingguo. The temple was completed, "and the gentry of the county thought it should be worshiped." The landlord class of Xingguo raised dozens of mu of land as a fund for the regular sacrifices of "Lord Hai Temple." Some officials who came to Xingguo after Hai Rui also opened a special room near the yamen and hung up the golden sign of "Xuehai Hall."

    During the Kangxi period, the landlord class of Xingguo changed "Lord Hai Temple" to "Hai Huang Temple," also commemorating Huang Weigui. Who was Huang Weigui? He was a famous executioner who suppressed peasant uprisings. During his tenure as magistrate of Xingguo County, he went all out to suppress the local peasant revolution. The masses said that once he led troops to attack a peasant uprising camp, but the peasant rebel army beat him to the ground and fled in defeat. The peasant rebel army chased him into the city, and he hid behind the plaque of the "Lord Hai Temple" beam before he escaped the judgment of the people. In the eyes of the Xingguo landlord class, Huang Weigui, like Hai Rui, was their "stalwart hero" and equally worthy of commemoration.

    The landlord class's commemoration of Hai Rui has not ended here. History always ruthlessly ridicules all ugly things with the facts of its development. In 1945, Liao Shangfan, the Xingguo County magistrate of the Kuomintang reactionaries, built a road in Xingguo city and named it "Hai Rui Road." This reactionary who massacred many revolutionary masses and plundered land in Xingguo also wanted people to learn from Hai Rui. This is truly not unique. History brings together "upright officials," executioners, corrupt officials, and all reactionaries to form one image. Isn't this a historical farce?

    The landlord class is so affectionate to Hai Rui, and Hai Rui is so affectionate to the landlord class, so who appointed the "upright officials," and who is vigorously promoting them? Isn't it clear?

    The Xingguo peasants have the opposite view of Hai Rui. A story is circulating among the peasants: Hai Rui was born from an orangutan, half of him has no hair and looks like a human; the other half has hair and looks like an orangutan. This story is certainly not true, but it reflects the love and hate of the peasant masses and their understanding of Hai Rui's essence. It vaguely and accurately depicts Hai Rui's counterrevolutionary two-faced tactics, and he is actually a beast.

    Local people also reported that no one among the people went to worship at the "Lord Hai Temple," and the ones who worshiped Hai Rui were the landlord bureaucrats and wealthy merchants. Peasants who were influenced by superstitious ideas before liberation only worshiped the "Earth God" and the "Goddess" temple.

    The landlord classes and their literati of the past dynasties have written a large number of biographies for their loyal sons and good sons, the so-called "upright officials," compiled countless poems, dramas, and stories, and established many temples and memorial arches, with the aim of deceiving the people and covering up the reactionary essence of the entire landlord regime. Don't some of the tunes of our "upright official" theorists sound very harmonious with the shouts of the feudal ruling class!

    The eyes of the people are sharp. In the minds of the Xingguo people, Hai Rui is a representative of the landlord class, an accomplice of the landlord class in oppressing and exploiting the peasants, and an executioner who suppressed the peasant revolution. This is the true Hai Rui in history. The "upright official" fabricated by the ruling class is a false Hai Rui. There has never been a so-called "upright official" in history. The peasant masses understand from the practice of class struggle such a truth: the landlord class will never be kind, and it is a daydream to ask the officials of the landlord class to do good things for the peasants. This is originally very clear. "Class struggle, some classes are victorious, and some classes are eliminated. This is history, this is thousands of years of civilization." How can it be believed that in the history full of life-and-death class struggle, the landlord class will send its representative—the "upright official"—to bestow blessings on the peasants? The "upright official" theorists use "upright officials" as a bridge to connect the oppressors and the oppressed, and will inevitably describe a history of class struggle as a history of class cooperation and class harmony.

      The "upright official" theory is a class harmony theory in historical research. The historical facts we investigated in Xingguo are a good refutation to the "upright official" theorists. The historical truth of class struggle declares the bankruptcy of the "upright official" theory.

    历史的真实宣告了“清官”论的破产	江西省赣州专区哲学社会科学联合会调查组
    提　要　兴国县的实地调查，弄清了海瑞在当地任知县时的若干历史事实，帮助我们进一步认识了海瑞的真实面目，彻底宣告了“清官”论的破产。海瑞在兴国的短短一年多时间里，用阴险毒辣的手段，镇压了好几起农民起义，他的双手沾满了革命人民的鲜血。地主阶级对海瑞颂扬备至。而在人民的心目中，海瑞则是地主阶级的政治代表，是地主中特别凶恶者。
    吴晗同志等“清官”论者以海瑞为榜样，连篇累牍地宣扬“清官”的功绩，竭力为“清官”争历史地位。他们的立论不过是依据封建文人根据统治阶级利益所写的史书。这样的立论，符合不符合历史的真实呢？为了弄清是非，最近，我们组织了一些同志到兴国县实地调查（海瑞于一五六三——一五六四年在此做过一年多知县）。通过访问群众，查阅地方文献，我们初步找到海瑞在兴国活动的线索。这些线索帮助我们弄清了一些历史的真实，宣告了“清官”论的破产。
          “为人民办事”的真相
    海瑞到兴国的时候，正是当地农民群众受到日益残酷的压迫和剥削的时候。“赋役日增，民多逃窜”，城外每走三二十里间，只有“寥寥星居，不及十余家”，“人丁凋落，村里荒凉”①。有些农民已经起而反抗，组织了起义军。在阶级矛盾尖锐、阶级斗争激烈的时刻上任的海瑞，据记载，他做了这几件事：整修“万松坝”，垦荒移民，丈量田亩，“平均赋税”。现在，让我们来看看这几件事的真相吧。
    万松坝，又名春口坝，在兴国城南潋水转折处，长五华里左右，据说，原来有十余丈宽。原坝是海瑞之前的兴国知县卢宁在任时修筑的。海瑞到兴国后，加以整修，并要老百姓在坝上种松数千棵，名为“海松”，以后就把这个坝称为“海松坝”。
    据《潋水志林》记载，海瑞走后不久，农民就在坝上种植甘蔗，“坝湮溃不存”。清康熙年间，兴国知县黄惟桂又强迫农民修复，农民起而反抗，“弗即工”。黄惟桂用残酷手段，“亲自督工”，坝勉强修复。但“黄去，民复决之”，坝又平毁了②。从这些记载中，可以看出在修筑万松坝上存在着激烈的斗争。农民坚决反对，而海瑞和其他封建官吏却十分醉心于这一工程。这到底是什么原因呢？
    修坝对农民有害无利。因为修坝之后妨碍坝内农田的合理灌溉。《潋水志林》说明，农民决坝的目的是为灌溉坝内数十顷的薯田。修坝之后容易造成坝内的内涝灾害。当地群众反映，这段坝修起后，每逢雨季，坝内积水无法排除，内涝成灾。
    地主对修坝却十分拥护。因为海瑞修“万松坝”，主要是为了“风水”。据说，在潋水转折处如果没有一片树林把“水口”挡住，城里的万富之家的“福气”就会流走。晚海瑞四十年到兴国做知县的王芮在他的《海忠介公祠堂记》中说：“海公植树松春口坝以培风气。”③清人张参鲁还为此写了一首《万松歌》，歌序说：“形家谓其地宜高耸，海公汝贤来作令，尝课民栽松数千本以当之。”歌中的一联是：“前人栽此蓄深意，风气完萃屏障纡。”④地主阶级选“风水”，择“福地”，乞灵于杳杳中的神灵，梦想着自己对农民更残酷的掠夺。海瑞修万松坝，正是为了迎合地主阶级的这种心理，以求得他们的拥护与支持，互相勾结，互相利用。
    此外，海瑞修坝的目的还在于为自己沽名钓誉。栽松是为了在兴国留下自己的名字。类似的一件事是：他在离开兴国之前，还要农民在靠近“万松坝”的一条小溪——程水旁栽了些柳树，称为“海公柳”。在小溪旁栽些柳树，对生产毫无意义可言，和万松坝的栽松一样，只是海瑞沽名钓誉的手段，是他为自己垒砌起来的向上爬的阶梯。
    这就是“万松坝”的真实历史。要修筑这样一条十余丈宽的堤坝，不知有多少农民被侵夺了田地，不知有多少农民为地主的利益付出了无偿的劳动。修起坝，栽了松，农民的生产受到损害，生活更加困苦了；地主获得了“福地”，心满意足。而海瑞则在鲜血淋淋的历史中留下了自己的名字，博得了封建文人的一片赞扬。在这片赞扬声中，也加入了“清官”论者的一支颂歌：海瑞“为人民办事”。
    关于垦荒移民，性质更是一目了然的。当地群众反映，海瑞确曾让农民在县西北开垦一些荒地，但荒地开垦之后，海瑞就宣布：这片土地是奖励求功名——读书人的，求得功名者可得之。兴国城郊有一个八十二岁的老人余福桂说：“海瑞专门和有钱有功名的人打交道，开发了些荒地，但我们穷人是没有份的。”千万农民辛辛苦苦开垦的土地，一下子落入了地主豪绅之手。得了官、发了财的地主阶级知识分子，在海瑞的帮助下霸占了这片新开的土地，而垦荒的农民则成了新的佃户。垦荒是海瑞费尽心机为地主阶级的利益想出来的一种极为残酷的掠夺、剥削农民的方法。
    这还不是海瑞垦荒的最终目的。垦荒移民的最终目的是为了镇压农民起义，巩固整个地主阶级的反动政权。
    在《兴国八议》中，海瑞明明白白说：垦荒移民如能实现，“不数年间南赣无余地，村居联络，可以挟制诸巢之寇。吉安等地无余民，衣食不窘，可无为逃流为盗贼之忧”⑤。一句话，垦荒移民是为了把农民进一步束缚在土地上，给他们以最低的生活条件，让他们仅仅能维持生命，为地主劳动，不致于把他们“逼上梁山”。而对于已起来反抗的农民，这则起了制约的、镇压的作用。看，海瑞为地主阶级的长远统治筹划得多周到！他的一切措施，进攻的矛头都直接指向农民群众；而我们的一些“清官”论者还在为他的这些措施叫好，说他是“为人民办事”呢！
    丈量田亩，“平均赋税”，这也是“清官”论者一再宣扬的海瑞的“功绩”。海瑞到兴国之后，确实急急忙忙地丈量了田亩。但这到底为了谁呢？只要举出一条材料，就可以得到答案。据张尚瑗《海瑞传》记载，海瑞到来之前，兴国“县例，佥粮户之富者当柱头，公私用度皆取焉，至是革除”⑥。原来丈量田亩的目的，是为了减轻地主阶级的负担，把他们理应负担的部分赋税进一步加到农民身上。何况在丈田的过程中，地主豪绅贿赂乡官，从中营私舞弊，结果地主的许多土地成了免交赋税的黑田，赋税摊到了农民身上。丈田的结果，是更加残暴的榨取农民。
    这种做法，海瑞是终生奉行的。直到他后来家居时，他还对他家乡的地方官献策，主张通过丈量田亩，把汉族地主应该负担的部分赋税，加到兄弟民族贫苦农民身上去。在地方官学他的样丈田之后，他就致书赞扬说：“今其后民田得以分其粮于黎而轻，是以虽彼富家私己亦合声称便。”⑦
    把丈量田亩减轻地主赋税、加重农民负担，说成是“对农民有利”、“为人民办事”，这岂不是颠红倒白吗？
    以上的几件事，说明海瑞处处从地主阶级的利益着眼，如何帮助地主压迫、剥削农民，是他的施政措施的出发点。这就是历史的真实。他根本就置农民的死活于不顾，哪儿来的“为人民办事”呢？在海瑞眼里，敢于起来反抗的农民是“匪”，是
  “盗”，是“黩悍刁民”；还没有起来反抗的农民是地主阶级理所当然的牛马，又哪来的“同情”，哪来的“爱民如子”呢？他在兴国时曾写过一首《恤农诗》，诬蔑农民是：“劳而不怨奔如马，贪且无能拙似鸠。”⑧在这位地主老爷的眼中，农民群众只是“劳而不怨”的牛马，如同笨头笨脑的“鸠”一样，是一群天生的奴隶。看，他是站在地主阶级一边，还是站在农民一边，不是昭然若揭了吗？！
    “为人民办事”，这是“清官”论者加在海瑞头上的大慈大悲的光轮。而海瑞自己，在如何对待农民这个问题上，却是十分明白的。他从他的地主阶级的阶级本性出发，本能地意识到他和农民是你死我活、誓不两立的仇敌。他骂他的一些不敢和农民起义军顽抗到底的同僚说：“儒者迂远而阔于事情，无所用之。有贼临城行冠礼者；有一筹不展、抱守忠义、俯首就戮者。圣人原无此等道理，原无此等忠义也。”⑨真是愤激填胸，摩拳擦掌，和农民不共戴天。“清官”论者细读海瑞的这段话，是能够清醒清醒头脑的。
      双手沾满革命人民鲜血的刽子手
    视农民为不共戴天的仇敌，海瑞的这一阶级本性，在农民起义面前得到了最充分的暴露。他在兴国的短短一年多时间，用阴险毒辣的手段，镇压了好些山寨的农民起义，双手沾满了革命人民的鲜血。
    据记载，自唐初直至清末，兴国的农民起义连续不断。历代的统治阶级，有的用血腥屠杀，有的用欺骗、分化、软化等阴险手段，把一次又一次的农民革命镇压下去了。据《潋水志林》记载，嘉靖四十年（即海瑞来兴国做知县的前一年），兴国县城被农民起义军围攻，地主官僚无法对付，后来上面派了很多兵来才使“巢贼”“败走出境”⑩。海瑞吸取了统治阶级镇压农民起义的历史教训，也曾使用十分卑劣的欺骗伎俩，屠杀兴国的革命农民。
    当地群众说，海瑞到任时，兴国有四个农民起义的大山寨，即：崖京（崖石寨，在今樟木公社境内），鲤省（鲤婆寨，在今江背公社境内），樟府（樟石寨，在今长岗公社境内），宝县（宝石寨，在今崇贤公社境内）。（另一说是十八营寨，而以上述四寨为主。）他们的主张是济困扶危，劫富济贫，专门打击远近的地主豪绅和万富大商，不动周围农民群众的财物。地主富商恨之入骨，而农民群众则十分拥护，常常在营寨遇到困难时凑些钱粮上去接济。海瑞一到兴国后，了解到当时各山寨力量十分强大，更兼悬崖峭壁，地势险要，海瑞手下只有二百五十二名兵丁?，用武力是镇压不了的。因此，他便制定了“剿抚兼施”的政策。据一些前辈说，海瑞曾扮成算命先生，上山在山寨王面前花言巧语，取得山寨王的信任。于是，他和山寨王歃血为盟，结拜为兄弟，了解了各营寨的兵力情况。后来，他派人到赣州府南赣提督吴百朋那里请兵，预先布下陷阱，以给母亲做寿为名，约请各山寨王下山给母亲拜寿。有的山寨王对海瑞有怀疑，不肯下山，海瑞便在他们面前对天盟誓说：“如若害人，身分四劈”。于是，他们信以为真，被骗下了山。他们一到县城，便被海瑞预先埋伏的人马抓起来了。当时，有的山寨王责问海瑞：“为什么不守诺言？”海瑞竟狡猾地拿出一个米升，用刀将米升劈成四块，说：“这就是我所说的‘身（升）分四劈’。”结果，他把这些山寨王都杀害了。另有一个山寨王名叫宋乃登的，海瑞早觉察到这人精明能干、坚强勇敢，骗不了他，就无耻地采用美人计的办法。他把自己的一个女婢伪称自己的女儿嫁给宋乃登，骗取他的信任。当诡计得逞之后，他就借岳婿关系请宋乃登下山拜寿。当宋乃登走到城南“懒人桥”时，忽然伏兵四起，这个山寨王也被捉杀害了。海瑞诱杀了各山寨王，并把他们的首级挂在城门上“示众”。全县的地主豪绅富商张挂红灯来庆祝，海瑞也因此立了大功。
    当地农民群众世代相传的这个传说虽然在若干细节上说法不一，但诱杀兴国的农民起义领袖这件事是一致的。这说明在农民群众的心目中，海瑞是一个极其阴险狡猾的刽子手。下面一些书面材料，也有力地证明了这一点。
    据《潋水志林》记载，海瑞到兴国的前一年，兴国发生了较大规模农民起义。虽“壬戌奉诏会师二十万分为七哨大剿”?，但要全部“剿”尽是不可能的。海瑞在《兴国八议》中提倡垦荒移民时，说明他的目的之一是要“挟制诸巢之寇”。《兴国县志》引《赣州府志》（谢志）称：海瑞到兴国后，就“悬赏捕盗”?。这就证明，海瑞到兴国上任时，兴国确实有农民起义，而海瑞也确实想方设法进行了镇压。
    又据《潋水志林·吕云传》称：兴国“吕云，……邑诸生，……嘉靖间尝以荐就吴督府百朋聘，指画方略，平峒冠三巢”?。三巢是指当时活跃于广东北部和江西南部一带的规模较大的农民起义军。兴国的农民起义，就是与之相联的一个部分。（据群众说，农民起义军的营寨里有些领袖是广东人。）吴百朋，就是海瑞一到兴国之后匆匆忙忙向他上《兴国八议》，提出“挟制诸巢之寇”的那个南赣提督。他于一五六三年巡抚南赣，是镇压赣南和广东农民起义的刽子手。黄秉石在《海忠介公传》中提到海瑞“以犒军功，升户部主事”?。所谓“犒军”，指的就是犒劳吴百朋镇压农民起义的官兵。从这些材料中，我们可以看到，当时整个赣南的地主阶级及其代表，是联合行动镇压农民起义的。上自督府，下至地主阶级知识分子，有的出谋献策，有的调兵遣将。海瑞在兴国镇压农民起义，只是这一镇压活动的一个组成部分，是这一个部分的直接指挥者。
    还有一条旁证材料，这就是海瑞自己的言论。一直到海瑞回乡家居，他一辈子都未停止过镇压农民起义的活动。乡居时海瑞手中没有掌握军队，不能亲自去进行血腥屠杀了，于是为地方官出谋献策，写信给陈南川，教他如何屠杀起来反抗的农民：“盖海寇与山寇不同。山寇有巢穴，海寇无定所，大兵一集则将飘然远去。故海边之善击贼者不与贼较多寡大小，而惟伺其便，……诱之伺之，千方百计。”?这“诱之伺之，千方百计”，就是海瑞在兴国诱杀农民起义领袖的最好供状，难道还需要什么证明吗？
    在我们面前，站着一个阴险、狡猾、伪善的，双手沾满鲜血的刽子手的形象。难道这样一个形象不是历史的真实，而统治阶级捏造出来的“打击豪强地主”，“为农民平反冤狱”的那个假海瑞，反倒是历史的真实吗？
    所有一切压迫阶级，为了维持自己的统治，都要采取反革命的两手政策。海瑞为了维持封建地主阶级的统治，所采取的所谓“剿抚兼施”的政策，不也正是这种反革命的两手政策吗？
    不知有多少革命农民牺牲在这个刽子手的屠刀之下，而“清官”论者却把这样一个刽子手，描绘为保卫农民利益的“卫士”，是农民的“救星”。这不是故意歪曲历史事实，为封建统治阶级帮腔吗？
    下面，我们请“清官”论者看一看那个死去的阶级是怎样歌颂和美化他的忠臣孝子海瑞的，而人民群众又是如何来形象地描述海瑞的。看一看，比一比，弄清自己和谁一个调调。
    地主眼中的忠臣，农民眼中的禽兽
    为了麻痹农民阶级意识的觉醒，为了欺骗广大的人民群众，地主阶级总是赋予自己的利益以普遍性的形式，把它的利益说成是所有阶级的共同利益。在“清官”问题上，他们玩弄着同样的手法，捏造出一个体现阶级调和的所谓“清官”，然后把它描绘成降福给一切阶级的“恩人”。
    吴晗同志《海瑞罢官》的末尾有一首诗：“天寒地冻风萧萧，去思牵心千万条，海父南归留不住，万家生佛把香烧”，就是这种传统手法的集中再现。
    “清官”果真是人民群众封的吗？人民群众果真对“清官”无比留恋和怀念吗？不，这是捏造，是歪曲。“清官”是地主阶级封的，只有地主阶级才对他留恋和怀念。
    海瑞死后，岭北副使龚道立下了一道命令，在兴国盖了“海公祠”。?祠建成后，“邑之缙绅谓宜有祀”?。兴国的地主阶级为
  “海公祠”的定期祭祀筹集了数十亩田为基金。海瑞之后的一些到兴国来的官吏，还在衙门附近辟了专室，挂上了“学海堂”的金字招牌。
    到了康熙年间，兴国的地主阶级把“海公祠”改为“海黄祠”，同时纪念黄惟桂。黄惟桂是个什么人？他是个镇压农民起义的有名刽子手。他在任兴国县令期间，全力以赴地镇压当地的农民革命。群众说，有一次他带兵去攻打农民起义的营寨，被农民起义军打得落花流水，大败而归。农民起义军追到城里，他躲在“海公祠”横梁的扁额背后，才逃脱了人民的审判。在兴国地主阶级眼里，黄惟桂和海瑞一样，都是他们的“汗马功臣”，都是一样值得纪念的。
    地主阶级的纪念海瑞，至此还没有结束。历史总是以它发展的事实，无情地嘲笑一切丑恶的东西。一九四五年，国民党反动派的兴国县长廖上璠，在兴国城里修了一条马路，命名为
  “海瑞路”。这个屠杀了许多革命群众，在兴国搜刮地皮的反动派，也要人们学起海瑞来了。这真是无独有偶。历史把“清官”、刽子手、贪官污吏，把一切反动派归聚在一起，合成一个形象。这岂不是历史的滑稽剧吗？
    地主阶级对海瑞和海瑞对地主阶级是这样地深情，那末，“清官”是谁封的，是谁竭力宣扬的，还不明明白白吗？
    兴国农民对海瑞的看法与此相反。在农民中流传着这样一个故事：海瑞是猩猩生的，他半边没长毛，是人的样子；另外半边长毛，是猩猩的样子。这个故事当然不会是事实，但它反映了农民群众的爱憎和他们对海瑞本质的认识。它隐约而确切地描绘了海瑞的反革命两面手法，他其实是禽兽。
    当地群众还反映，人民群众谁也不去祭祀“海公祠”，祭祀海瑞的是地主官僚富商。解放前受了迷信思想影响的农民，也只祭“土地”和“娘娘”庙。
    历代的地主阶级及其文人，为他们的忠臣孝子、即所谓“清官”，撰写了大量的传记，编了无数的诗歌、戏剧、故事，建立了许多庙堂和牌坊，目的在于欺骗人民群众，用以掩盖整个地主政权的反动实质。我们有些“清官”论者的调子，听起来不也和封建统治阶级的叫喊很和谐么！
    人民群众的眼睛是雪亮的。在兴国人民的心目中，海瑞是地主阶级的代表，是地主阶级压迫、剥削农民的帮凶，是镇压农民革命的刽子手。这就是历史上的真海瑞。而统治阶级捏造出来的那个“清官”，是个假海瑞。历史上本无所谓“清官”。农民群众从阶级斗争实践中明白这样一个真理：地主阶级是决不会发善心的，如果要地主阶级的官吏来为农民办好事，那是白日做梦。这本来是十分明白的。“阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。”?怎么能够认为，在充满你死我活的阶级斗争的历史上，会有地主阶级派出它的代表——“清官”，降福给农民呢？“清官”论者拿
  “清官”作为沟通压迫者和被压迫者的桥梁，必然会把一部阶级斗争的历史说成是一部阶级合作、阶级调和的历史。
      “清官”论是历史研究中的阶级调和论。我们在兴国调查的历史事实，对“清官”论者是一个很好的驳斥。阶级斗争的历史真实，宣告了“清官”论的破产。①②③④张尚瑗主编《潋水志林》卷一二、卷一、卷二○、卷二六。⑤《海瑞集》第二○三页。⑥《潋水志林》卷五。⑦《海瑞集》第四五九页。⑧《潋水志林》卷一六。⑨《海瑞集》第四四二页。⑩参见《潋水志林》卷一四。?参见《海瑞集·留丁壮文》。?参见《潋水志林》卷一四。?同治十一年《兴国县志》卷二二。?《潋水志林》卷七；同条见《兴国县志》卷二五。??《海瑞集》第五五四、四一三页。??《潋水志林》卷二○。?《毛泽东选集》第四卷，第一四九一页。
