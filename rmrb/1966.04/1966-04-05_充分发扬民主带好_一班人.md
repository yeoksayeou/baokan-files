    To be a good "team leader" as a county party secretary and lead the county party committee well, one must fully promote democracy. Recently, while studying the deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, and in combination with studying Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, I have had a particularly deep understanding of this point.

    In his article "On Perfecting the Party Committee System," Chairman Mao criticized the phenomenon of "the resolution of important issues not being decided by party committee meetings, but by individuals." Only by following Chairman Mao's words can the party committee achieve substantive rather than formal unity, and truly mobilize the enthusiasm of county committee members. Comrade Jiao Yulu is a good example in this regard.

    In the past, I rarely proactively "sounded out" the county committee members beforehand, often bringing issues directly to the committee for discussion. Because everyone was not mentally prepared, decisions could not be made promptly, or the decisions made were not perfect and lacked a solid ideological foundation, which affected the work enthusiasm of other comrades. Why? The key lies in my lack of democratic style and my inability to humbly listen to others' different opinions.

    I couldn't listen to others' opinions mainly in three situations: first, preconceived notions, a framework in my mind, believing I had a grasp of things; second, when the task was relatively urgent; and third, when I thought something should have been done but wasn't, and I was unwilling to listen to reasons when people explained why. Obviously, preconceived notions are often inconsistent with objective reality. If I do not seriously listen to others' different opinions, I will inevitably commit subjectivist errors. When the task is urgent, it is indeed difficult to spend a lot of time discussing it, but precisely because it is urgent, it is even more necessary to pool wisdom and find correct methods and measures among the masses. The process of mobilizing everyone to discuss is also the process of unifying ideological understanding and mobilizing everyone's enthusiasm. Individual decisions inevitably lead to a lack of unified action. Some things may seem wrong on the surface, but that is not always the case. Things are always complex, and there are often various reasons why things that should be done are not done. If people are not allowed to explain, how can the problem be solved? In March of the year before last, the county party committee decided to relocate a hospital, but it was not done by August. Without asking the reason, I criticized the comrade in charge of this matter. In fact, it wasn't that he didn't want to do it, but that there were actual difficulties. How could such criticism convince people? Moreover, even if the comrade was wrong, simply giving harsh criticism does not solve the problem, and it is difficult for the other party to accept. As a county party leader, under any circumstances, one must patiently listen to others' different opinions, clarify the ins and outs of things, so as not to block avenues of expression and ruin things.

    Last year, when the county party committee discussed planting safflower clover, I advocated doubling the area from 240,000 mu in the previous year to 500,000 mu, that is, about half of the total cultivated area, and required the entire county to do so proportionally. At that time, a comrade suggested that only 400,000 mu could be planted. I didn't "pay attention" to it, nor did I ask him to further explain the "reasons." After the preliminary plan was issued, some supported it and some opposed it. So, I went to several communes to listen and see, and I learned that there were three types of opposition: first, the land was low-lying and difficult to drain, so it could not be planted; second, the soil was thin and would not grow well, so planting it would be the same as not planting it; third, there was little land and many late autumn crops, so the crop rotation could not be arranged, and it was impossible to plant more. Later, we changed our approach and made different requirements for different regions: low-lying areas only planted in a few high fields; thin soil was plowed and fertilized as much as possible for spot planting; areas with little land adopted intercropping; and other suitable hilly areas planted more. As a result, the county planted 530,000 mu, and it grew well. The facts show that although the comrade who initially thought that only 400,000 mu could be planted was not entirely correct, it reflected some actual situations, and although my target of 500,000 mu was feasible, requiring everyone to plant half of the cultivated area was subjectivist. If I had not seriously studied the opinions of the cadres below and corrected this error later, then 500,000 mu would definitely not have been achieved. This incident made me realize that if the party committee is to fully promote democracy and do a good job of leadership, the "team leader" must not only seriously consider the different opinions of other party committee members (including wrong opinions), but also follow Chairman Mao's teachings: First, achieve "not being ashamed to ask," "first be a student, then be a teacher; first consult with the cadres below, then issue orders," and "never pretend to know what you do not know" (see "Methods of Work of Party Committees"). Second, strengthen investigation and research. The opinions below have correct ones and incorrect ones. Only by doing our own investigation and having a clear understanding in our own minds can we correctly analyze them and decide what to accept and what to reject.

    Whether or not we can fully promote democracy is not only a matter of leadership style, but also related to personal ideological cultivation. Looking back, the reason why I couldn't listen to opposing words boils down to the emotion that "the leader's word counts," fearing that accepting others' opposing opinions would damage my prestige. This is essentially the thought of being "superior to others" at work. The reason why Comrade Jiao Yulu was able to humbly listen to everyone's opinions and lead the "team" so well is also because he had only revolution in his heart, and not himself.

### 充分发扬民主带好“一班人”

    充分发扬民主带好“一班人”
    县委书记要当好“班长”，把县委这“一班人”带好，就要充分发扬民主。最近在学习焦裕禄同志的事迹中，结合学习毛主席的有关教导，对这一点感受特别深刻。
    毛主席在《关于健全党委制》一文中，批评了那种“重要问题的解决，不是由党委会议做决定，而是由个人做决定”的现象。照毛主席的话去做，才能使党委会取得实质上而不是形式上的一致，才能真正调动县委成员的积极性。焦裕禄同志在这方面是个好榜样。
    我过去很少主动与县委委员们事先“通气”，往往把问题一下子拿到委员会上去讨论，由于大家没有思想准备，往往不能及时做出决定，或者做出的决定不够完善，缺乏坚实的思想基础，结果影响其他同志的工作热情。为什么？关键就在于我缺乏民主作风，不能虚心倾听别人的不同意见。
    我听不进别人的意见，主要有三种情况：一是先入为主，脑子里有个框框，自认为有把握；一是任务比较紧的时候；还有一种是我认为该办的事人家没有办，向我申述理由就不乐意听。很明显，先入为主的框框往往是不符合客观实际的，如不认真听取别人的不同意见，就势必要犯主观主义的错误；任务紧，要花很多时间来讨论确实有困难，但也正因为紧，更需要集思广益，在群众中找出正确的方法和措施。发动大家讨论的过程，也就是统一思想认识、调动大家积极性的过程，个人说了算，势必没有统一的行动。有些事情，看起来似乎别人不对，其实不然。事物总是复杂的，该办的没办往往有着种种原因，不让人家说明理由，问题又怎么能够解决呢？前年三月，县委决定要迁移一所病院，到了八月还没有办好，我不问青红皂白把负责这件事的同志批评了一顿。实际上并非他不想办，而是存在着实际困难。这样的批评，人家怎能心服呢？再说，即使是那个同志有错误，只是生硬的批评也不解决问题，对方也难以接受。作为一个县委领导人，不论在什么情况下，都要耐心听取别人的不同意见，弄清楚事物的来龙去脉，这样才不至于阻塞言路，把事情搞坏。
    去年县委讨论种红花草，我主张由前年的二十四万亩翻一番，增加到五十万亩，即占耕地总面积的一半左右，并要求全县都按比例去办。当时有个同志提出只能种四十万亩，我没有“在意”，也没有要他进一步说明“理由”。初步方案下达后，下面有的拥护，有的反对。于是，我到几个公社去了一趟，听一听，看一看，才了解到反对的有三种情况：一是田地低洼，水很难排出去，不能种；一是土地薄，长不好，种了等于不种；一是地少，晚秋作物多，茬口排不开，不能多种。后来，我们就改变做法，对不同地区提出不同要求：低洼地区只在少数高田里种；土地薄的就尽可能翻犁下粪进行点播；土地少的就套种；其他宜种的丘陵地区就多种。结果全县种了五十三万亩，长得也不错。事实说明，最初那个同志认为只能种四十万亩虽然不对，但却反映了一些实际情况，而我的五十万亩的指标虽然可行，但要求一律按耕地面积的一半去种却是主观主义的。如果不是后来认真研究了下面干部的意见，纠正了这个错误，那么五十万亩是肯定不能实现的。这件事使我体会到，党委要充分发扬民主，做好领导工作，当“班长”的，就不但要认真考虑其他党委委员的不同意见（包括错误的意见），而且要遵照毛主席的教导：第一，做到“不耻下问”，“先做学生，然后再做先生；先向下面干部请教，然后再下命令”，“切不可强不知以为知”（见《党委会的工作方法》）。第二，加强调查研究。下面的意见有对的，有不对的，只有亲身做调查，自己心里有了底，才能正确地加以分析，决定取舍。
    能不能充分发扬民主，这不仅是个领导作风问题，而且也和个人的思想修养有关。回想我之所以听不进反对的话，归根到底就是有“领导说了算”的情绪，怕接受了别人的反对意见，有损自己的威信。这实质上是“高人一等”的思想在作怪。焦裕禄同志之所以能够虚心倾听别人的一切意见，把“一班人”带得那样好，也就是因为他心里只有革命，没有自己。
