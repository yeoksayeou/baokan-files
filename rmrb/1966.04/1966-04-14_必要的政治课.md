    Necessary Political Lesson
    Chang Enjiu, Party Branch Secretary of the Mud Drainage Section, Water Supply Plant, Anshan Iron and Steel Works
    Our mud drainage section has a relatively harsh working environment and high labor intensity, and some people are not at ease with their work. How can we lead this team well? We must find out the reasons for the problems and prescribe the right remedy to lead the team effectively. So, we used the method of class analysis to understand the situation thoroughly. Most of the workers came from relatively poor backgrounds; however, most of them are young and have not personally experienced suffering, and some are "unaware of the blessings they enjoy." We started with recollections and comparisons to enlighten the workers' class consciousness and educate everyone to never forget the past suffering. This is a necessary political lesson in class education.
    First, Educate the Party Members Well
    Class education begins within the Party. Only by educating the Party members first can we lead the masses to move forward together. We first convened a branch committee meeting and organized everyone to study a passage from Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Coalition Government": "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the interests of the people, making each of us who are alive feel sad when we think of them. Can it be that we still have any personal interests that we cannot sacrifice, or any errors that we cannot abandon?" I also talked about my family history and said: "Look at the past, compare it with the present, and never forget the pain once the wound heals, or forget who dug the well after drinking the water!" Everyone was very moved. Branch committee member Kang Wanfu said: "You suffered, but I suffered even more than you." He recounted the tragic experience of his mother being forced to death, his younger brother being given away, and himself working as a laborer for more than ten years, and he tearfully examined his own erroneous thoughts, expressing his determination to withstand difficulties and work in the factory for the rest of his life. The other two branch committee members also talked about their past and examined their thoughts. This meeting became a meeting of sharing sufferings, mutually enlightening and educating each other, inspiring fighting spirit, and strengthening revolutionary confidence. Subsequently, a general meeting of Party members was held to conduct recollection and comparison, which enhanced the class consciousness of the Party members. They said: "Thinking about the past makes us sad, looking at the present makes us remember our roots, and we must stick to our posts and carry out the revolution to the end."
    On the basis of enhancing the class consciousness of Party members, we also carried out activities of "recollecting bitterness and thinking about sweetness" among the masses. After the young worker Liu Zhijin came to the work section, he was not at ease with his work. He didn't quite believe the old workers' complaints about their past suffering. Later, he went home to visit his relatives and said to his mother: "It's better to go home because I earn less and work harder in Anshan." At this time, his mother said sadly: "Our family had nothing to eat or wear in the past, and your father was forced to go to sea to fish and died at sea. You are still not satisfied with the current life. If it weren't for the Communist Party, we mother and son would not know where we would be." A series of educational experiences enhanced Liu Zhijin's class consciousness. After returning to the factory, he sought out the branch to examine his thoughts of forgetting his roots. With the help of the Party branch, his work improved. In 1963, he became the deputy group leader, joined the Communist Youth League, and was elected as a member of the Youth League branch committee.
    Over the past four years, our Party branch has organized more than forty meetings to share sufferings, enabling young workers to understand the bitterness of the old society and the sweetness of the new society. They all said: We are determined to work in the mud drainage post for the rest of our lives.
    Class Education is a "Family Treasure"
    In recent years, we have deeply realized that class education is like a universal key, and it works wonders when we grasp it. In order to make class education regular, we strive to integrate class education into daily production and life. For example, when giving safety lessons and distributing labor protection supplies, we conducted education comparing the working conditions of workers in the old and new societies, which all achieved the effect of raising workers' class consciousness.
    In 1962, a new worker, Su Yuchen, came to our work section. He took a leave of absence to visit relatives without even working a single shift in the work section. After a few days, he was absent from work for another fifty days. The branch committee studied his family background and decided to start with class education to help him transform. I took the initiative to approach him. When talking didn't work, I worked with him, carrying mud together. At first, Su Yuchen deliberately loaded more and ran faster, intending to exhaust me, but I still persevered to the end. Once he asked me where I got so much strength. I said, "I used to be a laborer, and I even worked for landlords in the old society." When the old society was mentioned, we talked very intimately. One day after work, he asked me: "Why do you still wear this old set of clothes after work?" I consciously talked about the tragic experiences of the old society from wearing clothes: At that time, we had only one set of clothes for all seasons. We wore a "cover" in winter, altered it to a lined one in spring, and changed it to a single one in summer. Now I have forgotten my roots. This sentence "forgotten my roots" reminded him of his painful family history. With help, Su Yuchen transformed. Not only did he actively work himself, striving to do good deeds, but he could also help others, and he was successively rated as an advanced producer and pacesetter three times.
    Our work section started with class education, and class education is our work section's "family treasure." In order to educate workers to never forget the class exploitation of the old society and to always love the new society, we have set up a "Three Histories" exhibition room. The first political lesson for newly transferred workers is to see the "Three Histories" exhibition. When workers have ideological problems, we take them to see it. Some workers said: "Seeing the suffering of others reminds me of my own suffering. I must remember the past and carry out the revolution to the end."
    Due to the strengthening of education for Party members, branch committee members can lead by example. Now the vast majority of Party members in our branch can play an exemplary role, forming a united, strong, and close-to-the-masses combat collective, driving the broad masses of workers to complete various tasks.

    必要的政治课
    鞍钢给水厂排泥工段党支部书记　常恩久
    我们排泥工段，作业环境比较艰苦，劳动强度很高，有些人工作不安心。怎样带好这支队伍呢？必须找出产生问题的原因，对症下药，才能把队伍带好。于是我们用阶级分析的方法，摸清了底细。职工中大部分人出身比较贫苦；但是，他们大部分是青年，本人并没有亲身受苦的经历，有些人是“身在福中不知福”。我们就从回忆对比入手，启发职工阶级觉悟，教育大家永远不忘过去苦。这是阶级教育中一堂必要的政治课。
    首先要教育好党员
    阶级教育是从党内开始的。只有先教育好党员，才能带领群众共同前进。我们首先召开了支委会，组织大家学习了毛泽东同志《论联合政府》中的一段话：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”我又讲了自己的家史，并说：“看看过去，比比现在，决不能好了疮疤忘了疼，吃水忘了打井人！”大家都很感动。支部委员康万富说：“你苦，我比你更苦。”他讲述了母亲被逼死，弟弟给了人，自己扛了十多年活的悲惨遭遇，并痛哭流涕地检查了自己的错误思想，表示决心顶住困难，要在工厂干一辈子。其他两名支部委员也都讲述了自己的过去，检查了自己的思想。这个会成了诉苦会，成了互相启发、互相教育、鼓舞斗志、坚定革命信心的会。接着，召开党员大会进行回忆对比，提高了党员的阶级觉悟。他们说：“想想过去就感到难过，看看现在决不能忘本，一定要坚守岗位，革命到底。”
    在提高党员阶级觉悟的基础上，我们在群众中也开展了忆苦思甜活动。青年工人刘志锦到工段后，就不安心工作。老工人诉苦，他还不大相信。后来他回家探亲，对母亲说：“在鞍山挣钱少，又挨累，不如回家得了。”这时，他母亲沉痛地说：“咱家过去没吃没穿，你父亲被迫下海打鱼死在海里。你对现在的生活还不满意，要没有共产党，咱娘俩说不上到哪去了。”一连串的教育，使刘志锦提高了阶级觉悟。回厂后找支部检查了自己的忘本思想。在党支部的帮助下，他的工作好起来了，一九六三年当了副组长，加入了共青团，并被选为团支部委员。
    四年来，我们党支部先后组织过四十多次诉苦会，使青年工人懂得了旧社会的苦，新社会的甜。他们都表示：决心在排泥岗位上干一辈子。
    阶级教育是“传家宝”
    几年来，我们深深体会到：阶级教育就象一把万能钥匙，一抓就灵。为了使阶级教育经常化，我们努力把阶级教育贯穿到日常生产和生活中去。例如，在讲安全课、发劳动保护用品时，进行了对比新旧社会工人劳动条件的教育，都收到了提高工人阶级觉悟的效果。
    一九六二年，我们工段新来了个工人苏玉臣。到工段一天班没上，就歇探亲假。几天后，又旷工五十天。支部委员会研究了他的出身情况，决定从阶级教育入手，帮助他转变。我主动接近他，谈心不行，就跟他一起劳动，一起抬泥。开始，苏玉臣故意多装快跑，有心要把我累垮，可我还坚持干到底。有一次他问我，哪来的这么大劲，我说：“我以前也是个力工，旧社会还给地主扛过活。”提起旧社会，我俩谈得很投机。一天下班后，他问我：“为什么下了班还穿着这套旧衣服？”我就有意识地从穿衣服讲到了旧社会的悲惨遭遇：那时，一年四季一件衣服，冬天穿“套子”，春天改夹的，夏天改成单的，现在倒有些忘了本。这一句“忘了本”的话，使他回忆起痛苦的家史。经过帮助，苏玉臣转变了，不仅自己积极工作，争着做好事，而且还能帮助别人，先后三次被评为先进生产者和标兵。
    我们工段是以阶级教育起家的，阶级教育是我们工段的“传家宝”。为了教育职工永远不忘旧社会的阶级剥削，永远热爱新社会，我们设立了个“三史”展览室。新调来的工人，第一堂政治课就是看“三史”展览。职工思想有了问题，就带他们去看。有的工人说：“看了别人的苦，引起了我的苦，一定要记住过去，革命到底。”
    由于加强了对党员的教育，支部委员能以身作则，现在我们支部的绝大多数党员都能起模范作用，形成了一个团结的、坚强的、联系群众的战斗集体，带动广大职工群众完成了各项任务。
