    A Few Words on a Drop of Water
    Luoyang First Tractor Factory
    Jia Xidao
    At a discussion on opposing waste, an old worker vividly said: "Some of our people, when eating at home, if they drop a single soybean on the ground, they will turn on the light even at night to find it and pick it up; some family members of employees washing vegetables, won't throw away a rotten cabbage, placing it in the sink to rinse, turning on the faucet, filling the sink with flowing water, making the water more valuable than the vegetable."
    This old worker's words are very thought-provoking: the difference between saving and wasting reveals the struggle between classes, that is, the struggle between public and private, between individualism and collectivism.
    A grain of rice, a vegetable, is yours; a kilowatt of electricity, a pool of water, should also be seen as yours. Some people don't see the problem this way, what does that indicate? The answer is: a little less public spirit, a little more selfishness. This incorrect thinking must be educated and corrected.

    滴水小议
    洛阳第一拖拉机厂
    贾喜道
    在反浪费的一次讨论会上，一位老工人形象地说：“我们有些人在家吃饭，自己一颗豆粒掉在地上，那怕是夜黑天，扭亮电灯也要把它找到拣起来；有些职工家属洗菜，一棵烂白菜舍不得丢，放在水池里冲洗，拧开龙头，池满水流，菜还没水值钱。”
    这位老工人的话很发人深思：节约和浪费里面存在着阶级和阶级的斗争，即公与私之间、个人主义与集体观念两种思想的斗争。
    一粒粮，一棵菜，是自己的；一度电，一池水，也要看成是自己的才对。有的人不是这样去看问题，说明了什么呢？回答是：公字少一点，私字多一点。对这种不正确的思想，必须进行教育改正。
