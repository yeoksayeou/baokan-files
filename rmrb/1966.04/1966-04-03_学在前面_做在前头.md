    Learning Comes First, Action Comes First
    Amateur counselors at youth centers dare to take on heavy burdens. They work hard to learn scientific and technical knowledge, learning while teaching; they patiently help students make progress politically.
    In Mudanjiang City's eighteen youth centers, there are usually two to three thousand young people studying here, but only twenty full-time cadres. A large amount of teaching and counseling work relies on volunteer counselors. They are students and teachers, not caring about pay or benefits, diligently learning and working. They say: "For the revolution, we are willing to do this work."
    These counselors are not afraid of setbacks and dare to take on heavy responsibilities. Those who undertake teaching and counseling do everything possible to learn diligently ahead of time, learning while teaching. Those who undertake political counseling are wholeheartedly committed to helping students and progressing together.
    Wu Shuqin, a counselor for the fruit tree specialty class at the city's youth center, is responsible for teaching professional courses. She is a junior high school graduate, where would she have learned this subject! What to do? Learn! She said, "Others learn sitting down, I learn running." She is not afraid of hardship and asks for advice everywhere. In one year, she ran all over five farms and fruit tree teams on the outskirts of Mudanjiang City and connected with five technicians and four old fruit farmers, often visiting them to ask for advice. In the autumn of 1964, she heard that the forestry department was running a technical training class at the Gongnong Brigade of the Hualin Commune, more than thirty miles from the city. She braved the rain and carried her luggage to get there. The teaching technician was very moved. In the spring of 1965, she went to the industrial bureau's fruit tree farm to learn pruning. She didn't rest on Sundays and insisted on practicing at the fruit tree farm, until her hands were red and swollen from the cold. Recently, she went to Ning'an Bohai Commune to visit students who had gone to the countryside to work collectively. On the train back, an old farmer talked about fruit tree cultivation techniques with his fellow travelers, and she didn't give up the opportunity to humbly ask for advice. She studies diligently and earnestly, and receives enthusiastic help from people wherever she goes. The old farmers of the Gongnong Fruit Tree Team laugh and say when they see her: "Ha, the little student is here again!"
    It is difficult to do political counseling work for the students of the youth center. However, Chu Qiuzhen, a political counselor at the Chang'an Youth Center in Dong'an District, has done a remarkable job. This nineteen-year-old Communist Youth League member showed amazing patience in her work. She has visited 80% of the students' parents and fully understood the students' situation in all aspects. When mischievous students confront her, she doesn't get angry; when they scold her, she doesn't get annoyed. She studies Chairman Mao's works with her classmates, participates in labor together, and tries to get close to her classmates and form close friendships with them. She firmly believes: "No student cannot be educated well with Mao Zedong Thought." A male student named Niu came to the "home" on and off, working for three days and resting for two, looking gloomy all day long. Chu Qiuzhen talked to him, but he always said "something happened at home" and didn't say the details. Once Chu Qiuzhen talked to him again, she started by talking about her own family labor and slowly guided him to tell the truth. With Chu Qiuzhen's help, his attitude towards learning has changed significantly.
    On December 13, 1965, Chu Qiuzhen received two notices on the same day: one was that the city had organized a youth center counselor training class, which would start tomorrow! The other was that the woodworking machinery factory asked her to be an apprentice, starting work tomorrow. That night, she couldn't sleep, where should she go tomorrow? She launched a struggle in her mind. Finally, she said to her mother: "Mom, my parents gave me life, the Party nurtured me to grow up, I can't only care about my own small 'family', I should first consider the big 'family'. The youth center has just been established, and there is a lot of work waiting for me to do, how can I leave and walk away!" The next morning, she happily went to the counselor training class to register.

    学在前面　做在前头
    青少年之家的业余辅导员敢于挑重担子。他们下苦功夫学习科学技术知识，边学边教；他们耐心地帮助学生在政治上进步。
    牡丹江市十八所青少年之家，平时经常有两千到三千青少年在这里学习，专职干部只有二十名。大量的教学辅导工作，要靠义务辅导员来做。他们是学生，也是教师，不计报酬，不讲待遇，勤勤恳恳地边学习，边工作。他们说：“为了革命，我们心甘情愿地做这个工作。”
    这些辅导员们不怕碰钉子，敢挑重担子。担任教学辅导的，千方百计，下苦功学在前面，边学边教。担任政治辅导的，一心把同学帮助好，共同前进。
    市青少年之家果树专业班辅导员吴淑琴，担任专业课的教学工作。她初中毕业，哪里学过这门课呀！怎么办？学！她说：“别人坐着学，我跑着学。”她不怕苦，到处拜师访友。一年中间，她跑遍了牡丹江市郊五个农场和果树队，和五名技术员、四名老果农挂上了钩，经常登门求教。一九六四年秋天，听说林业部门在离城三十多里路的桦林公社工农大队果树队办了个技术训练班，她冒着雨，背着行李赶了去。教课的技术员很受感动。一九六五年春天，她到工业局果树场学剪枝，星期天也不休息，坚持在果树场里练习，把手都冻红肿了。最近她到宁安渤海公社去慰问集体下乡的同学，回来在火车上，一位老农和同座的旅伴谈果树栽培技术，她也不放弃机会，虚心求教。她学习虚心认真，到哪里都得到人们热情的帮助。工农果树队的老农们一见了她，就笑着说：“哈，小学生又来啦！”
    对青少年之家的学生做政治辅导工作是有困难的。可是东安区长安青少年之家的政治辅导员褚秋珍却做得很出色。这个十九岁的女共青团员，在工作中表现了惊人的耐心。她访问过百分之八十的学生家长，充分地了解了学生各方面的情况。调皮的学生顶撞她，她不急；骂她，她也不恼。她和同学们共同学习毛主席著作，一起参加劳动，想方设法接近同学，和他们结成亲密的友谊。她坚定地相信：“用毛泽东思想没有教育不好的学生。”有个姓牛的男学生上“家”来，三天打鱼，两天晒网，整天愁眉苦脸。褚秋珍找他谈，他总是说“家里有事”，不说详情。有一次褚秋珍又找他谈，她从自己家庭劳动谈起慢慢地引导他谈了真心话。经过褚秋珍的帮助，他的学习态度有了明显的转变。
    一九六五年十二月十三日，褚秋珍一天接到了两份通知，一份是市里组织了青少年之家辅导员训练班，明天开课！一份是木工机械厂让她去当徒工，明天上班。这晚上，她失眠了，明天到哪里去？她思想上展开了斗争。最后她对妈妈说：“妈妈，我是父母生身，党培养长大，我不能只顾自己的小‘家’，我应该首先考虑大‘家’，青少年之家刚刚办起来，有许多工作等着我去做，我怎么能扔下就走开呢！”第二天清晨，她高高兴兴地去辅导员训练班报到了。
