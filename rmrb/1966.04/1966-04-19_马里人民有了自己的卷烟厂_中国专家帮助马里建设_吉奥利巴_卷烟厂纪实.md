Walking out of the urban area of Bamako and looking east, the snow-white factory buildings and tall chimneys next to the tree-lined avenue of the "Sotuba" farm immediately catch your eye. This is the "Djoliba" cigarette factory that the people of Mali are proud of.

In the early morning, workers riding bicycles, chatting and laughing, head enthusiastically towards the cigarette factory, facing the rising sun. Girls in colorful national costumes walk towards the factory...

In the tobacco leaf workshop, thirty-eight Malian female workers sit in rows next to stripping machines, skillfully stripping the tobacco leaves. Male workers are intently operating the shredding machines. In the cigarette-making workshop, Malian workers press a button, and cigarettes immediately gather into a small mountain, which are sent to the packaging workshop, one cart after another. Here, more than sixty female workers, with their skillful hands, expertly pack packs of "Djoliba," "Freedom," "Unity," and "Gem" brand cigarettes. Seeing their skillful techniques, who would have thought that they had only worked with Chinese experts for less than half a year to reach this level? The Malian people are hardworking, simple, intelligent, eager to learn, and willing to work… This all makes the Chinese experts very moved and admire them. However, for decades, those Western colonialist gentlemen have indiscriminately labeled African people with words like "ignorant," "uninformed," and "clumsy." Now, the awakened, independent, and free Malian people are giving the colonialists a resounding slap in the face with their actions.

The "Djoliba" cigarette factory is another colorful flower in the history of friendship between the Chinese and Malian peoples. It has written a brilliant page in the history of Mali's national industrial development.

A Friendship of Trust

In April 1963, entrusted by the people of our motherland, we came to Mali to work with Malian friends on selecting and planning the cigarette factory. Thanks to the direct concern of Malian President Modibo Keita, all work progressed smoothly. However, when the work entered the most intense stage, one day, Malian friends told us: "Now, some foreigners are advising us not to cooperate with you on this project. They say that Malians smoke brown cigarettes, and Chinese people smoke yellow cigarettes. China is still a backward and underdeveloped country. China cannot produce brown cigarettes that suit the tastes of the Malian people. Let us build this cigarette factory for you!" The Malian friends then told us: "I told them categorically that we do not want to accept your advice. We Malians trust Chinese friends. We believe that they will produce cigarettes that suit our taste. Our determination to cooperate with China on this project is unshakable."

The Malian people's trust in us added endless strength to us and accelerated the progress of our work. Therefore, we spent less than three months with our Malian friends to determine the factory site and successfully completed all the necessary preparations for building the factory.

On January 11, 1965, the construction of the cigarette factory began.

One day, a foreigner suddenly appeared at the construction site. He was holding a camera and swaggered around the construction site, taking pictures here and there. Mussa, the chairman of the construction site union, saw this and stepped forward to question him:

"What country are you from? Do you have a photography permit?"

This arrogant foreigner sized up Mussa and replied haughtily: "I am an American. I am a traveler. Seeing your construction site, I want to take a few pictures..."

Mussa said: "You are a traveler, why are you sitting in a car used by the diplomatic mission?"

"This..." This American, who claimed to be a traveler, could not answer when faced with Mussa's question. He stayed for a while and then said: "If I'm not allowed to take pictures, I won't take pictures." After saying that, he walked towards his car. Mussa immediately caught up and stopped him with his hand, saying: "You can't leave! If you want to leave, give me the film!"

"I am a traveler, I have the freedom to take pictures!" The American got anxious.

But after he finished speaking, when he looked around, he became as deflated as a punctured ball. It turned out that in the meantime, a dozen angry Malian workers had surrounded him, their angry eyes staring at this American. In the end, he had no choice but to obediently open the camera, take out the film, hand it to Mussa, and creep into the car and drive away. The Malian workers laughed when they saw this scene.

Ensuring the Factory's Needs First

In July of last year, it was the rainy season in Mali. The clear and calm Niger River was already full. All kinds of sand needed for engineering in Mali were manually dug from the bottom of the Niger River in small canoes. Obviously, the sand-digging work had entered the most difficult moment; at the same time, it was also the time when the cigarette factory needed a lot of sand and stone. What to do? If the sand and stone could not be supplied on time and in the required quantities, the cigarette factory would not be able to officially start production during Mali's fifth anniversary of independence. Therefore, sand and stone became the key to the success or failure of the overall situation. Faced with this situation, the Industrial Department of the Malian Development Ministry immediately made a decision, notifying the manager of the sand and stone factory to suspend the supply of sand and stone to other projects, and prioritize the needs of the cigarette factory. Therefore, the normal construction of the construction site was guaranteed.

After the cigarette factory started construction, various types of work, such as bricklayers, scaffolders, fitters, welders, concrete mixers, plumbers, and installers, all started at the same time. However, Mali had relatively few skilled workers in this area. What to do? Chinese experts selected workers from the Malian laborers for training. After just over a year, nearly two hundred out of more than two hundred laborers have been promoted to level two or three workers by the Malian Labor Bureau. Twenty-six-year-old welder Mamadou is a prominent example. He stayed close to the Chinese experts at all times during work, carefully observed everything, and understood the experts' instructions. If he failed once, he tried twice, practiced repeatedly, and asked questions repeatedly. Sometimes, in order to learn the technology, he even forgot the time to get off work. In this way, through his hard and diligent study, he finally reached the third level.

After several months of working together, Chinese experts, technicians, and Malian workers established deep feelings. In their work, they jointly created a language. It was neither completely Chinese, nor purely French or Bambara. It was a combination of these three languages and gestures. Every morning, Chinese and Malian experts and technicians greeted each other. Malian friends greeted Chinese friends in Chinese, saying "Hello," and Chinese friends also asked "Ani so kuma" (Bambara for "Hello"). Whether it was Sunday or after work, you would see groups of two or three Malian worker brothers coming to the Chinese experts' dormitory as guests. Some came to learn technology and culture from Chinese friends; some came to play table tennis with Chinese friends; and some came to the reading room to look at Chinese picture books...

True Friends and Fake Friends

The chairman of the construction site union was a regular visitor to the Chinese experts' dormitory. He often said:

"At home, I read Chairman Mao's works, often until late at night. From Chairman Mao's works, I learned a lot of revolutionary principles, and I learned the principles of how to work and how to live."

Whenever people asked him why he was working so hard with the Chinese, with such vigor and energy, solving work problems tirelessly, he said:

"Since Mali declared independence, people from many countries in the world have come to Mali, wanting to help Mali 'build'. Americans have come, French have come, British have come, Soviets have come. But some people came to Mali, walked around, and looked around. Finally, they shrugged their shoulders at us, spread their hands, and said: Mali is too poor, there is nothing to do, and then they left. Only Chinese friends, after coming to Mali, saw the actual situation in Mali. They believed that this was the result of colonialism. Chinese friends did not leave, but stayed to help us build. Now, all of Mali knows that Chinese friends are helping us build cigarette factories, sugar factories, match factories... What country can compare with Chinese friends? China's policy is correct, and it is genuinely trying to help us young countries develop."

Malian Development Minister Seydou Badian Kouyate was even more caring for the Chinese experts and technicians. He often disregarded the day's fatigue and went to the construction site, which was as bright as day, at eight or nine o'clock in the evening to visit the Chinese experts and technicians, asking about their work and health. After the groundbreaking ceremony of the cigarette factory, he talked intimately with the Chinese experts and technicians about the cigarette factory, saying:

"...You will hear on the radio the President's praise for the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese experts. Today, we have achieved a great victory. All of Africa will hear this news. They will realize that China is their friend."

"The Most Outstanding Achievement"

Since November 3rd of last year, when the "Djoliba" cigarette factory officially started production, merchants from Kayes, farmers from Sikasso, cadres from Gao, and people from all directions across the country, have flocked to the cigarette factory. Visitors come in a continuous stream, batch after batch. Among them are: Malian President Modibo Keita, Tanzanian President Nyerere, as well as other heads of state, businessmen, journalists, students... According to statistics, from the beginning of the factory construction to the present, there have been more than four thousand visitors. No wonder cigarette factory manager Bakary Camara humorously said: "I am a 'reception manager'."

After the visit, everyone praised the Malian people for being able to build such a large-scale, modern, spacious, and bright cigarette factory in less than eight months after five years of independence, unanimously saying: "Amazing! Miraculous speed!" Even that American reporter with ulterior motives had to admit: "Amazing! Beyond my imagination."

An cadre from the Malian Ministry of Transportation said after the visit: "It is truly amazing that such a large factory could be built and put into production in just eight months!" An old worker said: "It's amazing that such a modern factory can be operated entirely by us Malians after a few months of training! I remember when I was building some houses with the French during the French rule. But they left, and I still didn't know how to build houses." After the visit, a worker held a "Djoliba" brand cigarette in his hand and danced and shouted "Akani, gu su be" (Bambara for "Very good"). In his New Year's message this year, Malian President Modibo Keita praised the "Djoliba" cigarette factory as "the most outstanding achievement of 1965."

The "Djoliba" cigarette factory, like a bright peony, has bloomed in the hearts of the Malian people, and has bloomed in the heart of West Africa. The "Woo... Woo..." whistle symbolizes the Malian people moving towards a new life, encouraging the Malian people to build their homes more vigorously with their own hands. (Attached picture)

### 马里人民有了自己的卷烟厂——中国专家帮助马里建设“吉奥利巴”卷烟厂纪实

    马里人民有了自己的卷烟厂
    ——中国专家帮助马里建设“吉奥利巴”卷烟厂纪实
    王建国
    走出巴马科市区，向东望去，在“索吐巴”农场林荫大道旁，那雪白的厂房，那高高的烟囱，一下子就会跳进你的眼帘。这就是马里人引为骄傲的“吉奥利巴”卷烟厂。
    清晨，骑着自行车，有说有笑的工人们，兴致勃勃地迎着朝阳，一伙一伙地向烟厂驰去，穿着五颜六色的民族服装的姑娘们朝烟厂走去……。
    在烟叶车间里，三十八名马里女工，一排一排地坐在抽梗机旁，熟练地抽着烟叶；男工们在全神贯注地操纵着切丝机。在卷烟车间里，马里工人一按电钮，烟卷顿时集成小山样的一堆，一车紧跟一车地送往包装车间。在这里，六十多名女工，那一双一双的灵巧的手，熟练地包着一条条的“吉奥利巴”牌、“自由”牌、“团结”牌和“宝石”牌的香烟。看到她们这等熟练技术，谁能想到，她们仅仅和中国专家工作了不到半年的时间，就达到了这种程度。马里人勤劳淳朴，聪明、好学、肯干……。这都使中国专家十分感动和钦佩。然而，几十年以来，那些西方殖民主义者的老爷们，却把什么“愚昧”、“无知”、“笨拙”等等字眼横加在非洲人民的头上。现在，觉醒了的、独立了的、获得了自由的马里人民，用自己的行动，给了殖民者一个响亮的耳光。
    “吉奥利巴”烟厂是中马两国人民友谊史上又一朵五彩缤纷的花朵，它在马里民族工业发展的历史上写下了灿烂的一页。
    友谊的信任
    一九六三年四月，我们受祖国人民的委托来到马里，同马里朋友一道进行烟厂的选厂规划工作。由于马里总统莫迪博·凯塔的直接关心，一切工作进行的很顺利。但是，当工作进入最紧张阶段时，一天，马里朋友告诉我们：“现在，有些外国人劝我们不要同你们在这个项目上合作。他们说，马里人抽褐色烟，中国人抽黄色烟。中国还是一个落后的，不发达的国家。中国制不出合乎马里人民口味的褐色烟来。还是让我们给你们建设这座烟厂吧！”马里朋友接着又对我们说：“我斩钉截铁地告诉他们，我们不想接受你们的劝告。我们马里人相信中国朋友。我们相信他们会制出合乎我们口味的香烟来。我们和中国在这个项目上合作的决心是不可动摇的。”
    马里人民对我们的信任，给我们增添了无穷无尽的力量，加速了我们工作的进展。因此，我们仅仅用了不到三个月的时间，就同马里朋友一起，确定了厂址，胜利地完成了建厂的一切必要的准备工作。
    一九六五年一月十一日，烟厂动工了。
    一天，一个外国人，突然出现在工地上。他拿着照相机，大摇大摆地在工地上窜来窜去，东照一张，西拍一张。工地工会主席姆萨看到了，就走上前去责问他：
    “你是哪国人？有没有摄影许可证？”
    这个神气十足的外国人打量了一下姆萨，竟趾高气扬地回答说：“我是美国人。我是一个旅行家。看到你们的工地，我也想照几张……”
    姆萨说：“你是旅行家，为什么坐着外交使团用的车子？”
    “这个……”这个自称旅行家的美国佬，面对着姆萨的责问，一时答不上来。他呆了一会又说：“不让照，我不照了。”说完，就向他的车子走去。姆萨立刻赶上去，用手拦住他说：“你不能走！要走的话，把胶卷给我！”
    “我是旅行家，我有照相的自由！”美国佬发急了。
    但等他说完后，向周围一看时，他就象泄了气的皮球一样软了下来。原来在这中间，十几位气愤的马里工人围了上来，愤怒的眼光逼视着这个美国佬。最后，他不得不乖乖地打开照相机，取出胶卷，交给了姆萨，灰溜溜地钻进汽车跑走了。马里工人们看到这情形，都笑了起来。
    首先保证烟厂需要
    去年七月，正值马里的雨季。清澈、平静的尼日尔河已经满槽。马里工程上需要的各种沙子，都是用人工，驾驶着小独木舟，从尼日尔河河底挖上来的。显然，这时的挖沙工作已进入了最困难的时刻；而在同时，也正是烟厂需要大量沙石的时候。怎么办？如果沙石不能如期如数供应，在马里独立五周年的时候，烟厂就不能正式投入生产。因此，沙石成了有关大局成败的关键。面对着这种情况，马里发展部工业处立即下了决定，通知沙石厂经理，暂停供应其它工程的沙石，一切优先供应烟厂的需要。因而，保证了工地正常的施工。
    烟厂开工以后，各工种，如瓦灰工，架工，拼装工，电焊工，混凝土搅拌工，水暖工，安装工等等，都一齐上马，同时进行。可是，马里在这方面的技术工人又相对的比较少，怎么办？中国专家从马里的壮工中挑选工人进行培养。仅仅经过一年多的时间，在二百多名壮工中，已经有近二百名被马里劳动局升为二级到三级的工人。二十六岁的电焊工玛玛杜就是一个突出的例子。他在劳动中时刻不离中国专家，处处留心观察，领会专家的指点。一次不成，两次，反复地练，反复地问。有时为了学习技术，甚至忘掉了下班的时间。就这样，经他艰苦勤奋地学习，终于达到了三级的水平。
    经过几个月的共同劳动，中国专家、技术人员和马里工人，建立了深厚的感情。在劳动中，他们共同创造了一种语言。它既不是完完全全的中文，也不是纯粹的法文和班巴拉语。而是这三种语言和手势的结合。每天清晨，中马专家和技术人员互相问候。马里朋友用中文向中国朋友们问：“你好”，中国朋友也问“阿尼苏科玛”（班巴拉语“你好”的意思）。不论是星期日，还是下班后的时间里，都会看到三三两两的马里工人兄弟来到中国专家宿舍作客，有的来向中国朋友学技术，学文化；有的来和中国朋友打乒乓球；有的来到阅览室看中国画报……。
    真朋友和假朋友
    工地工会主席是中国专家宿舍的常客。他常常说：
    “在家里，我看毛主席的著作，经常看到深夜。从毛主席著作中，知道了很多革命道理，知道了如何工作，如何生活的道理。”
    每当人们问起他为什么和中国人在一块时，他的干劲这么大，精神旺盛，不知疲倦地解决着工作上的问题时，他说：
    “自从马里宣布独立以来，世界上有很多国家的人来到马里，想帮助马里进行‘建设’。美国人来了，法国人来了，英国人来了，苏联人来了。但是，有些人来到马里，到处走了走，看了看。最后向我们耸耸肩，两手一摊说：马里太穷了，没有什么可搞的，就走了。唯有中国朋友，来到马里之后，看到了马里的实际情况。认为这是殖民主义者所造成的后果。中国朋友没有走，留下来帮助我们建设。现在，全马里都知道是中国朋友帮助我们建烟厂，糖厂，火柴厂……。有哪一个国家能与中国朋友相比呢？中国的政策是正确的，是真正想帮助我们这些年青的国家搞建设的。”
    马里发展部长塞杜·巴迪安·库亚特对中国专家和技术人员更是无微不至地关怀。他经常不顾一天的劳累，晚上八九点钟还要到那照耀得如同白天一样的工地上，看望中国专家和技术人员，询问他们的工作和身体情况。在烟厂开工典礼后，他和中国专家、技术人员，就亲密无间地谈起烟厂来了，他说：
    “……你们会从广播里听到总统对中国专家的革命精神的赞扬。今天，我们取得了很大的胜利。全非洲都会听到这个消息。他们会认识到中国是他们的朋友。”
    “最卓越的成就”
    自去年十一月三日，“吉奥利巴”烟厂正式开工投入生产以来，卡依的商人，锡加索的农民，卡奥的干部，来自全国的四面八方的人，涌向了卷烟厂。参观的人川流不息，一批紧跟着一批。他们中间有：马里总统莫迪博·凯塔，坦桑尼亚总统尼雷尔，以及其他一些国家的元首、商人、新闻记者、学生……。据统计，从去年初开始建厂至今，共有四千多名参观者。难怪烟厂经理巴卡里·卡玛哈幽默地说：“我是个‘接待经理’了。”
    参观完后，无论是谁，都对马里人民能够在独立后的五年，用不到八个月的时间，建成这样一座大规模的、现代化的、又宽敞又豁亮的烟厂，赞不绝口，异口同声地说：“了不起呀！神妙的速度！”就连那别有用心的美国记者，也不得不承认：“了不起！出乎我的想象。”
    马里交通秘书处的一位干部参观后说：“在短短的八个月把这样大的一个工厂建成，而且投入生产，真使人感到惊奇！”有个老工人说：“这么一座现代化的工厂，经过几个月的培训，全都由我们马里人来操作了，真是了不起呀！记得在法国统治的时候，我和法国人一起盖过一些房子。可是，他们走了，我还不会盖房子。”有一个工人参观完后，手里拿着“吉奥利巴”牌香烟，手舞足蹈起来，喊“阿卡尼，古苏贝”（班巴拉语“太好了”的意思）。马里总统莫迪博·凯塔在今年元旦献词中称赞“吉奥利巴”烟厂是“一九六五年最卓越的成就。”
    “吉奥利巴”烟厂，它象一朵鲜艳的牡丹在马里人民的心中绽放了，在西非的腹地绽放了。那“呜……呜……”的汽笛声，象征着马里人民走向新的生活，鼓舞着马里人民更加精力充沛地依靠自己的双手勤劳地建设自己的家园。（附图片）
