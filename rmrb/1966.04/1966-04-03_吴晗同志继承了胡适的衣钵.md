　　Summary: Comrade Wu Han admired and followed Hu Shi in his early years, and was deeply influenced by him. To this day, Comrade Wu Han's view of history and methodology are inherited from Hu Shi. Whether it is in promoting bourgeois reformism, praising emperors, generals, and ministers, or opposing the guidance of Marxism in historical research, Comrade Wu Han is peddling Hu Shi's pragmatism.

　　In his article "I Overcame 'Supra-Class' Viewpoints," Comrade Wu Han said that in his early years he studied under Hu Shi at China Public University and wrote a paper that was greatly "appreciated" by Hu Shi. After Hu Shi left China Public University, he felt it was "boring to continue studying," so he entered Tsinghua University. At Tsinghua University, it was still thanks to Hu Shi's help that he obtained a work-study opportunity to continue his studies. Comrade Wu Han confirmed that he was "deeply influenced by Hu Shi and drilled into the dead end of textual research." Comrade Wu Han's article narrated his past and claimed that he had long "been willing to stand on the proletarian standpoint." However, in the sixteen years since liberation, has Comrade Wu Han's bourgeois world outlook changed? Has he drawn a clear line with Hu Shi? The answer is no. As long as we arrange and compare some of Comrade Wu Han's and Hu Shi's remarks and analyze them one by one, we can see that Comrade Wu Han's view of history and methodology today is precisely the pragmatism peddled by Hu Shi.

　　Below, I will only analyze and criticize Comrade Wu Han's three erroneous viewpoints.

　　Erasing class struggle as the driving force of historical development, promoting bourgeois reformism

　　As everyone knows, during the May Fourth Movement, Hu Shi, the spokesperson of the comprador class, transported pragmatism from the United States to China. His purpose in promoting pragmatism was to oppose Marxism, especially the Marxist theory of class struggle.

　　In his notorious "Problems and Isms," Hu Shi said that the theory of class struggle "is too biased towards proclaiming 'class consciousness,' and unconsciously fosters a kind of class hatred." He vehemently slandered the Chinese people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal movement as "emotional impulses," and "five-minute fever." He said that "a free and equal country cannot be built by a group of slaves," and in one stroke erased the great role of peasant revolutionary struggles in history, viciously cursing the Yellow Turbans, Song Jiang, Li Zicheng, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the Boxers and other peasant uprisings as "roving bandits" and "rebellions." Conversely, he praised the "heroic figures" and "outstanding talents" of the exploiting classes, exaggerating their individual roles to the point of absurdity. He said that the United States was created by Washington, who "opened a new era for history and planted seeds of boundless happiness for future generations" ("The Immortal"). He also said that during the Meiji Restoration, thanks to the efforts of dozens of people like Ito Hirobumi, Japan, a small country with a small population, "leapt to become one of the three or five major powers in the world" ("Confidence and Reflection").

　　Everyone knows that Hu Shi's pragmatist idealist view of history and reformist political views have been completely bankrupt in the face of the victory of the people's revolution. However, in recent years, Comrade Wu Han actually picked up this tattered stuff again, and imitated Hu Shi's tone, attacking the theory of class struggle and promoting reformist views. He blatantly sang a counter-tune to Mao Zedong Thought, and twisted Chairman Mao's scientific theory that "class struggle, some classes triumph, others are eliminated. Such is history, such is the history of civilization for thousands of years." ("Cast Away Illusions, Prepare for Struggle") into "the history of the development of human society is the history of people who dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act" ("Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" Preface). Who exactly are the so-called "people who dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act"? Comrade Wu Han did not make a direct explanation, but in his series of articles, he gave a positive and clear answer, referring to the feudal ruling class, emperors, generals, and ministers. In Comrade Wu Han's view, emperors and generals such as Qin Huang, Han Wu, Tang Zong, Kangxi, Qianlong, as well as "upright officials" Hai Rui and Zhou Chen, were all "people who dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act," and were the masters of history. Their reform measures determined the development of history. For these people, one can only affirm, not criticize; one can only praise, not expose. If you don't do this, and even emphasize peasant revolutionary struggles in textbooks and write less about emperors, generals, and ministers, Comrade Wu Han will alarmingly say: "The bright side of history is lost... history is almost completely dark and gloomy," "Our ancestors are all bad people, and we are all descendants of bad people." This is really absurd! Isn't the bright side of history the revolutionary struggle of the people, but the cruel rule of the exploiting classes, and our ancestors are not the working people but the emperors, generals, and ministers? Comrade Wu Han, who often claims to be a historian, ignores this most basic historical fact, deliberately confuses black and white, and slanders peasant revolutionary struggles and Chinese history. What is the difference between this and Hu Shi's rhetoric!

　　Comrade Wu Han regards the reform measures of emperors, generals, and ministers as everything in feudal society, and as the only driving force for historical progress, which is to promote bourgeois reformism. In today's world revolutionary situation of "the seas are churning, clouds and waters raging, and the five continents are rocking, wind and thunder roaring," promoting reformism will inevitably paralyze the people, disintegrate the revolution, and ask the people to abandon the struggle against imperialism and the socialist revolution.

　　Following Hu Shi in praising emperors, generals, and ministers, acting as the ideological spokesperson for the bourgeoisie

　　In order to spread the pragmatist idealist view of history and promote political reformism, Hu Shi tried his best to find evidence in Chinese history to praise emperors, generals, and ministers, and "heroes." Originally, the biographies of some emperors, generals, ministers, and "heroes" in history had been exhausted with flattery and praise by feudal literati, but Hu Shi was still not satisfied. He said: "Because there is no truly vivid and expressive biography, there has not been a great figure in two thousand years who can be admired and inspire excitement." ("Preface to the Biography of Mr. Zhang Jian of Nantong") Therefore, he tried his best to encourage historians to "record the truth" and sing praises for these "great figures." And "there should be vivid and expressive masterpieces to record their lives, use the meticulous craftsmanship of embroidery needles to search for and verify their facts, and use the far-sighted vision of a broadsword to judge their position in history" (ibid.).

　　Although Hu Shi promoted it so vigorously, and also boasted of being a "biography enthusiast," he never wrote a biography of a "great figure," at most only praising them in a few words in some articles. Little did he expect that Hu Shi's wish would be fulfilled by Comrade Wu Han. In recent years, Comrade Wu Han has simply become a new "biography enthusiast." In the short three or four years from 1959 to 1962, he wrote no less than thirty articles on historical figures in one breath. In these articles, he not only repeated Hu Shi's clichés in terms of fundamental viewpoints and wording, but even wove some of Hu Shi's words into them and gave them full play. Is this an exaggeration? No, not at all.

　　Let's look at the evaluation of the "upright official" issue:

　　Hu Shi once named a few "upright officials" in history, such as Bao Zheng, as "target-like figures," saying: "There have been many ingenious prison verdict stories in ancient times, either recorded in historical books or circulated among the people. People generally do not know their origins, and these stories are easily piled on one or two people." ("Preface to The Three Heroes and Five Gallants")

　　Comrade Wu Han also called a handful of "upright officials" in history as "target-like figures," and imitated Hu Shi, saying: "Many good things that people idealize are piled on them. Bao Zheng of the Song Dynasty, and Kuang Zhong and Hai Rui of the Ming Dynasty are all famous examples." ("Kuang Zhong and Zhou Chen")

　　Hu Shi explained that the reason why the ancient "upright officials" can be permanently passed on by word of mouth is only "because his mind is clear and he can carefully examine the facts, can judge lawsuits, and extend justice to the people" ("Preface to The Travels of Lao Ts'an").

　　In addition to agreeing with Hu Shi's statement, Comrade Wu Han also expanded on it, breaking the framework of old novels and dramas that only limited "upright officials" to the scope of "redressing unjust cases," and promoted them to the ranks of "accomplished politicians." Not only that, he also followed Hu Shi's will, using the "far-sighted vision of a broadsword" and the "meticulous craftsmanship of embroidery needles" to search for historical materials and "vividly portray" them. Comrade Wu Han praised Hai Rui as the "savior" of the people, saying: "The people loved him. When he was dismissed from office in Suzhou, the people cried along the street to see him off, and some families painted his image and enshrined it in the main hall. When he died in office in Nanjing, the people were very sad, the market stopped operating, and the procession of white-clad and crowned mourners, along the riverbank, with condolences and mourning, stretched for hundreds of miles." ("Hai Rui") He also praised Zhou Chen as a "good official who loved the people," saying that he was easy to approach, had no airs, and often went deep into the masses to solve the people's worries, "He lived in Jiangnan for a long time, became familiar with the people, and was like a family. He often visited the countryside, without attendants, in the courtyard, in the fields, talking to farmers face to face, chatting, asking what difficulties and problems they had, and helping to give ideas" ("Kuang Zhong and Zhou Chen"). Comrade Wu Han repeatedly said that one cannot demand too much from the ancients with today's standards, but he described these loyal slaves of the feudal landlord class vividly, rendering them mysteriously, as if they were closer to the masses than the revolutionary cadres of the socialist era. What is this for?

　　Who should be praised and who should be opposed is a question of whether historical research serves proletarian politics, and whether historians stand on the proletarian standpoint. Since ancient times, any class has decided who should be praised and who should not be praised or opposed based on the vital interests of its own class and the needs of class struggle. It has never been the case that some people are praised for no reason in a supra-class and supra-political manner. Comrade Wu Han closely followed Hu Shi, singing praises to the emperors, generals, and ministers of the exploiting classes. Isn't this becoming the ideological spokesperson for the bourgeoisie and making reactionary propaganda for the bourgeoisie!

　　Opposing the guiding significance of Marxism in historical research in the name of "theory emerging from history," encouraging young people to take the road of bourgeois experts

　　Comrade Wu Han's performance in research methods is also sparing no effort to peddle Hu Shi's pragmatism. In his article "How to Study History," Comrade Wu Han explained the relationship between theory and historical facts, and proposed the saying that "theory is in history" and "theory emerges from history." He said: "Theory is in history, not outside of history. Therefore, it is necessary to use correct methods, grasp a large amount of sufficient and credible historical data, arrange them reasonably, and embody the viewpoint through the narration of historical facts... As long as the true historical facts are clearly laid out, the viewpoint will naturally emerge, so we say: 'Theory emerges from history.'" Since theory comes from historical data, he believes that people should "learn history first and then theory. Grasp the practical things (referring to historical data - author) to test the theory."

　　We have never denied the significance of detailed possession of historical data for historical research. However, there are various different viewpoints and attitudes on how to treat historical data. Hu Shi also flaunted "carefully searching for facts" or "respecting facts and respecting evidence," but everyone knows that his "carefully searching for facts" served his "boldly proposing hypotheses" and arbitrarily tampering with history. Marxists treat detailed possession of historical data with a combination of a high degree of revolutionary spirit and a high degree of scientific attitude, believing that the sorting of historical data must be under the guidance of the Marxist class analysis method, and after the transformation and production of "removing the crude and taking the refined, removing the false and retaining the true, moving from this to that, and moving from the appearance to the essence," can historical data that conforms to historical truth be refined, and the essence and internal laws of history be explored. Otherwise, people will be confused by a pile of chaotic historical data and unable to find the basic clues of history. The reason is very simple, because "in a very long historical period, everyone's understanding of social history can only be limited to one-sided understanding, on the one hand, because the prejudice of the exploiting classes often distorts social history, and on the other hand, because the small scale of production limits people's horizons."
    (Mao Zedong: "On Practice") Isn't this the case? How much of the Twenty-Four Histories has not been distorted by the prejudice of the exploiting classes, and how much has not been fragmented and individually described the historical process? How can it be said that "as long as the true historical facts are clearly laid out, the viewpoint will naturally emerge"? Obviously, Comrade Wu Han's "theory emerges from history" is ulterior motive, he is to find new grounds for selling pragmatist idealist view of history, arbitrarily arranging or smearing history for himself.

    In order to promote his "theory emerges from history" ideological method, Comrade Wu Han also repeatedly publicized and encouraged historical workers and young students to take the road of bourgeois experts, telling them to run to libraries, drill libraries, read books to death, and read books to death. He said that if you want to learn history well, "the answer is only two words: reading. Leaving reading, it is impossible to learn history" ("Several Questions on Studying History"). The "book" he refers to is historical data. In addition to reading historical data, you must also copy historical data and memorize historical data; master historical data, without asking the value, without asking the root and the branch, what dynasty, year number, person's name, place name, and even why the Tang Dynasty emperor's surname is Li, what is the "Taishi Ye" in Peking Opera, etc., must be clarified, otherwise you will not learn history well. As for the current domestic and international class struggle, in his opinion, you don't need to spend too much time and energy to pay attention to it, because "for the current reality, domestic and international events, we live in this era, we can understand through reading newspapers, magazines, talking, listening to reports, etc., and get knowledge" (ibid.).

    Here, Comrade Wu Han openly disseminates individualistic poison to the vast number of historical workers and young students, attempting to drag them from the hot class struggle into the quagmire of tedious textual research in the dead paper pile. This is a very harmful road of bourgeois experts, and this road is contrary to the road of intellectual revolutionization and laborization guided by the Party. The Party pointed out: "We must, through cultural revolution, through the revolutionary practice of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, establish a vast team of working-class intellectuals who serve socialism and are both red and expert." ("On Khrushchev's Phony Communism and Its Lessons for the World in History") This is the only correct road. If you do as Comrade Wu Han said, you can only cultivate revisionists and cultivate new bourgeois intellectuals. In fact, there are indeed many young people who have been deceived by him and followed him, drilling into the dead paper pile all day long, resulting in detachment from politics, detachment from practice, and the growth of serious individualistic ideas of fame and gain. The bad influence created by Comrade Wu Han among the vast number of young students must be completely eliminated, and the pragmatist idealist view of history he spread in the historical circles must be severely criticized!

### 吴晗同志继承了胡适的衣钵

    吴晗同志继承了胡适的衣钵
    张岗
    提要　吴晗同志早年曾经推崇、追随胡适，并受了胡适极深的影响。至今吴晗同志的历史观和方法论，还是从胡适那里一脉传衍来的。无论是在宣扬资产阶级的改良主义，大捧帝王将相，还是在反对马克思主义对历史研究的指导等方面，吴晗同志都是贩卖胡适的实用主义货色。
    吴晗同志在《我克服了“超阶级”观点》一文中说，早些年他在中国公学曾受教于胡适门下，写过一篇论文，很得胡适的“赏识”。胡适离开中国公学以后，他感到“再念下去也无聊”了，于是考入清华大学。在清华大学，还是由于胡适的帮助，才得到一名工读生的机会，继续求学。吴晗同志确认不讳，受了胡适“极深的影响，治学钻到考据的牛角尖里去”。吴晗同志的这篇文章，叙述了他的过去，并且自称早已“愿意站在无产阶级的立场上”了。可是，解放十六年来，吴晗同志的资产阶级世界观究竟改变了没有？他和胡适究竟划清了界限没有？回答是：没有。只要把吴晗同志和胡适的一些言论排列、对照一下，逐一加以分析，就可以看出，吴晗同志今天的历史观和方法论，正是贩卖的胡适实用主义货色。
    下面我仅就吴晗同志三方面的错误观点，加以分析和批判。
    抹煞阶级斗争是历史发展的动力，宣扬资产阶级的改良主义
    大家知道，在五四运动时期，胡适这个买办阶级的代言人，从美国把实用主义贩运到中国。他推销实用主义的目的，是为了反对马克思主义，特别是反对马克思主义的阶级斗争学说。
    胡适在其臭名昭著的《问题与主义》中说：阶级斗争学说“太偏向申明‘阶级的自觉心’一方面，无形之中养成一种阶级的仇视心”。他声嘶力竭地污蔑中国人民反帝反封建运动是“感情的冲动”，“五分钟的热度”。说“自由平等的国家不是一群奴才建造得起来的”并且一笔勾销了历史上农民革命斗争的伟大作用，毒骂黄巾、宋江、李自成、太平天国、义和团等农民起义为“流贼”、“匪乱”。反之，他对于剥削阶级“英雄人物”、“优秀人才”却赞扬备至，把他们的个人作用夸大到荒诞离奇的地步。他说，美国是由华盛顿缔造的，他“替历史开一新纪元，替天下后世的人种下无量幸福的种子”（《不朽》）。又说，明治维新时期由于伊藤博文等几十个人的努力，使一个小国寡民的日本“一跃而为世界三五大强国之一”（《信心与反省》）。
    谁都知道，胡适的实用主义唯心史观和改良主义政治主张，在人民革命胜利面前，已经彻底破产了。但是吴晗同志在最近几年，居然又重新拣起这套破烂，也仿效胡适的腔调，大肆攻击阶级斗争学说，宣扬改良主义观点。他明目张胆的和毛泽东思想唱对台戏，把毛主席关于“阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。”（《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》）这一科学理论，篡改成为“一部人类社会的发展史，也就是敢想敢说敢做的人们的历史”（《海瑞罢官》序）。所谓“敢想敢说敢做的人们”究竟指哪些阶级、哪些人？吴晗同志没有作直接解释，但是在他的一系列文章中则作了肯定而明确的回答，就是指着封建统治阶级、帝王将相。在吴晗同志看来，象秦皇、汉武、唐宗、康熙、乾隆以及“清官”海瑞、周忱之类帝王将相都是“敢想敢说敢做的人们”，是历史的主人，他们的改良措施决定着历史的发展。对于这些人，只能肯定，不能批判；只能歌颂，不能揭露。假如你不这样做，甚至在教材中强调了农民革命斗争，对帝王将相少写了一些，吴晗同志就危言耸听地说：“历史上的光明面丧失了，……历史几乎成为漆黑一团，灰溜溜的”，“我们的祖先全是坏人，我们都是坏人的子孙”。这真是奇谈怪论！难道历史的光明面不是人民群众的革命斗争而是剥削阶级的残酷统治，我们的祖先不是劳动人民而是帝王将相？常以历史家自命的吴晗同志，竟然无视这一最基本的历史事实，故意颠倒黑白，污蔑农民革命斗争，污蔑中国历史。这与胡适的论调相比究竟有多少差别！
    吴晗同志把帝王将相的改良措施看成是封建社会的一切，看成是历史前进的唯一动力，这就是宣扬了资产阶级的改良主义。在今天“四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激”的世界大革命形势下，宣扬改良主义，其结果必然是麻痹人民，瓦解革命，叫人民放弃反对帝国主义斗争，放弃社会主义革命。
    追随胡适大捧帝王将相，充当资产阶级的思想代言人
    为了散播实用主义唯心史观和提倡政治上的改良主义，胡适极力找寻中国历史上的证据，来为帝王将相、“英雄豪杰”歌功颂德。本来历史上一些帝王将相、“英雄豪杰”的传记，已被封建文人用尽了阿谀、赞美言词，可是胡适仍不满意。他说：“因为没有一篇真能写生传神的传记，所以二千年中竟没有一个可叫人受敬崇拜感发兴起的大人物。”（《南通张季直先生传记序》）所以他竭力鼓吹历史家们为这些“大人物”“纪实传真”，歌功颂德。并且“应该有写生传神的大手笔来记载他们的生平，用绣花针的细密工夫来搜求考证他们的事实，用大刀阔斧的远大识见来评判他们在历史上的地位”（同上）。
    胡适虽然这样卖劲地鼓吹，并且也自诩为“传记热”，但是他从未写出一篇“大人物”传记，至多也不过在一些文章中零零碎碎地为他们赞扬了几句。那里料到，胡适的遗愿竟为吴晗同志所完成。吴晗同志近几年简直成了一名新的“传记热”，他在一九五九到一九六二短短的三四年内，一连气写了不下三十余篇论述历史人物方面的文章。在这些文章中，他不仅在根本观点和提法上重复胡适的陈词滥调，甚至把胡适的一些只言片语也罗织起来，作了淋漓尽致的发挥。这样说是否夸大其词？不，毫不夸张。
    让我们看看对“清官”问题的评价吧：
    胡适曾把历史上寥寥几个“清官”如包拯一类的人，取名为“箭垛式的人物”，说：“古来有许多精巧的折狱故事，或载在史书，或流传民间，一般人不知道他们的来历，这些故事遂容易堆在一两个人的身上。”（《三侠五义序》）
    吴晗同志也把历史上屈指可数的几个“清官”称为“箭垛式的人物”，并摹仿着胡适说：“许多人民理想的好事都被堆砌到他们身上了。象宋朝的包拯，明朝的况钟和海瑞，都是著名的例子。”（《况钟和周忱》）
    胡适解释古来的“清官”，所以能永久传诵人口的原因，只不过是“因为他的脑子清楚明白，能细心考查事实，能判狱讼，替百姓伸理枉”（《老残游记序》）。
    吴晗同志除了同意胡适的说法外，还加以发挥，打破了旧小说、戏剧只把“清官”局限于“平反冤狱”范围的框框，而把他们提升到“有成就的政治家”的行列。不仅如此，他还遵照胡适的遗志，用“大刀阔斧的远大识见”和“绣花针的细密工夫”来搜寻史料，为他们“写生传神”。吴晗同志把海瑞捧为人民的“救星”，说：“人民是爱戴他的。他在苏州罢官的时候，老百姓沿街哭着送别，有些人家画了他的象供在中堂里。死在南京任上，老百姓非常哀痛，市面停止了营业，白色衣冠送葬的行列，夹着江岸悼祭哀哭的百里不绝。”（《海瑞》）又把周忱捧为“爱民的好官”，说他平易近人，没有架子，还常常深入群众，解决人民的苦忧，“在江南年代久了，和百姓熟了，象一家人一样，时常到农村去访问，不带随从，在院子里，在田野里，和农夫农妇面对面说家常话，谈谈心，问问有什么困难，什么问题，帮着出主意”（《况钟和周忱》）。吴晗同志口口声声说不能以今人标准苛求古人，却把这些封建地主阶级的忠实奴才们，描述得绘声绘色，渲染得神乎其怪，好象他们比社会主义时代的革命干部还更接近群众。这究竟为了什么？
    什么人应当歌颂，什么人应当反对，这是关乎历史研究是不是为无产阶级政治服务的问题，历史工作者是不是站在无产阶级立场的问题。自古以来，任何一个阶级都是根据自己阶级的切身利益和阶级斗争的需要，去决定什么人应当歌颂，什么人不应当歌颂或反对的。超阶级超政治地、无缘无故地为某些人歌功颂德，是从来不曾有的。吴晗同志紧紧追随着胡适，为剥削阶级帝王将相大颂赞歌，这岂不是成了资产阶级的思想代言人，为资产阶级作了反动宣传！
    借“论从史出”反对马克思主义在历史研究中的指导意义，鼓吹青年走资产阶级的专家道路
    吴晗同志表现在治学方法上，也是不遗余力地贩卖胡适的实用主义货色。吴晗同志在《如何学习历史》一文中解释理论与史实的关系时，曾提出“论在史中”、“论从史出”的说法。他说：“论在史之中，不是在史之外。因此，就要运用正确的方法，掌握大量的、充分的、可信的史料，加以合理的安排，通过对史实的讲述，把观点体现出来。……只要把真正的史实摆清楚了，观点自然就出来了，所以我们说：‘论从史出’。”既然理论是从史料中来的，所以他认为人们应该“先学历史后学理论。抓住实际的东西（即指史料——笔者）来检验理论”。
    详细地占有史料对于研究历史的意义，我们从来不曾否认过。但是如何对待史料，却有各种不同的观点和态度。胡适也标榜“细心搜求事实”或“尊重事实，尊重证据”，可是谁都知道，他的“细心搜求事实”是为其“大胆提出假设”、随心所欲地篡改历史服务的。马克思主义者对待详细占有史料，则是采取高度的革命精神和高度的科学态度相结合的原则，认为整理史料必须是在马克思主义阶级分析方法指导之下，经过“去粗取精、去伪存真、由此及彼、由表及里”的改造制作工夫，才能提炼出符合历史真实的史料，探索出历史的本质和历史的内在规律。否则就会使人迷惘于一堆纷乱的史料中，而找不到历史的基本线索。道理很简单，因为“在很长的历史时期内，大家对于社会的历史只能限于片面的了解，这一方面是由于剥削阶级的偏见经常歪曲社会的历史，另方面，则由于生产规模的狭小，限制了人们的眼界。”
    （毛泽东：《实践论》）事实不正是这样吗？一部二十四史，有多少不是受到剥削阶级偏见的歪曲，又有多少不是片断而个别地描述历史过程？这怎能说“只要把真正的史实摆清楚了，观点自然就出来了”呢？显然，吴晗同志的“论从史出”是别有用心的，他是为了给自己贩卖实用主义唯心史观、任意摆布或涂抹历史，找寻新的根据。
    吴晗同志为了推销他的“论从史出”思想方法，还一再宣传、鼓动历史工作者和青年学生走资产阶级专家道路，叫他们跑图书馆、钻图书馆，读死书、死读书。他说，要想学好历史，“答案只有两个字：念书。离开念书，学历史就不可能”（《关于研究历史的几个问题》）。他所谓的“书”，就是指史料。除了读史料，还要抄史料，背史料；掌握史料，不问价值，不问本末，什么王朝、年号、人名、地名，乃至为什么唐朝皇帝姓李，京戏里的“太师爷”是什么，等等，都得搞清楚，不然就学不好历史。至于当前国内外阶级斗争，在他看来可不必过于花费时间和精力去注意，因为“对当前现实，国内外大事，我们生活在这时代，可以通过看报、看杂志、谈话、听报告等方式了解，得到知识”（同上）。
    在这里，吴晗同志公开向广大史学工作者和青年学生散布个人主义毒素，企图把他们从火热的阶级斗争拖进钻故纸堆繁琐考据的泥潭中。这是一条十分有害的资产阶级专家道路，这条道路是与党指引的知识分子革命化、劳动化道路背道而驰的。党指出：“我们要经过文化革命，经过阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验的革命实践，建立一支广大的、为社会主义服务的、又红又专的工人阶级知识分子的队伍。”（《关于赫鲁晓夫的假共产主义及其在世界历史上的教训》）这是一条唯一正确的道路。如果象吴晗同志所说的那样去做，那就只能培养出修正主义者，培养出新的资产阶级知识分子。事实上，也确有不少青年上了他的当，跟着他走，成天钻到故纸堆中，结果脱离政治，脱离实践，滋长了严重的个人主义名利思想。吴晗同志在广大青年学生中造成的这种恶劣影响是必须加以彻底清除的，他在史学界散播的实用主义唯心史观也必须给以严厉的批判！
