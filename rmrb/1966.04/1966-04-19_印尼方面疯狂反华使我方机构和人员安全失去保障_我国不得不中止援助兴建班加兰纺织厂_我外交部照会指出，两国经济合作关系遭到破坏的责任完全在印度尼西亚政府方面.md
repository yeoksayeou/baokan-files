　　Xinhua News Agency, April 18th: Xu Jingwu, Deputy Director of the First Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, summoned Baron Sudadishastra, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Indonesian Embassy in China, this afternoon and handed him a note informing the Indonesian government that, since the Indonesian right-wing generals clique seized power, it has become even more frenzied in its anti-China activities, which have undermined the foundation of economic cooperation between the two countries. The Chinese side has no choice but to suspend its aid for the construction of the Bangaran Textile Factory and withdraw its Chinese experts. The note pointed out that the responsibility for the damage to economic cooperation between the two countries lies entirely with the Indonesian government. The full text of the note is as follows:

To the Indonesian Embassy in China:

　　The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China presents its compliments to the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia in China and, regarding the matter of China's assistance to Indonesia in building the Bangaran Textile Factory, states the following:

　　According to the Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement signed between the Chinese and Indonesian governments on October 11, 1961, the Chinese government has made tremendous efforts to assist Indonesia in building the Bangaran Factory. The Chinese side, in accordance with the provisions of the relevant contract, has shipped more than 8,200 tons of equipment and materials, accounting for more than 70 percent of the total equipment and materials, and has sent construction experts to help build the factory. Until September 1965, the progress of this project had been smooth.

　　After October 1965, the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces launched a large-scale anti-China and anti-Chinese movement, creating a series of serious anti-China and anti-Chinese incidents. Despite this, in order to safeguard the friendship between the two peoples, the Chinese government exercised utmost restraint and continued its aid construction work. Chinese experts continued to work under extremely difficult conditions. The Chinese government also notified the Indonesian government that, under the condition of guaranteed safety, China was prepared to continue shipping equipment and materials. All this shows that the Chinese government is sincere in fulfilling the Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement between the two countries and has made its utmost efforts.

　　The Indonesian government has repeatedly stated in the past that it would take measures to stop anti-China and anti-Chinese activities and remove obstacles to economic and technical cooperation between the two countries. However, the anti-China and anti-Chinese activities of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces have intensified. After the Indonesian right-wing generals clique seized power, it became even more frenzied in its anti-China activities. Recently, it has even gone so far as to openly dispatch armed forces together with right-wing thugs to attack the Chinese Embassy, injuring Chinese diplomats. The safety of Chinese representative offices and Chinese personnel has been completely deprived of guarantees. Obviously, the actions of the Indonesian side have undermined the foundation of economic cooperation between the two countries, making it impossible to continue the work of aiding the construction of the Bangaran Factory.

　　For this reason, the Chinese government notifies the Indonesian government that the Chinese side has no choice but to suspend its aid for the construction of the Bangaran Factory and withdraw its Chinese experts. The Chinese government must point out that the responsibility for the damage to economic cooperation between the two countries lies entirely with the Indonesian government.

　　With the highest respect.

                        Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China

    印尼方面疯狂反华使我方机构和人员安全失去保障
    我国不得不中止援助兴建班加兰纺织厂
    我外交部照会指出，两国经济合作关系遭到破坏的责任完全在印度尼西亚政府方面
    新华社十八日讯　中华人民共和国外交部第一亚洲司副司长徐净武今天下午召见印度尼西亚驻华大使馆临时代办巴伦·苏达迪沙斯特拉，交给他一份照会，通知印度尼西亚政府，由于印度尼西亚右派将领集团夺取政权以后，更加疯狂反华，已破坏了两国经济合作的基础，中国方面不得不中止对班加兰纺织厂的援建工作，并撤回中国专家。照会指出，两国经济合作关系遭到破坏的责任，完全在印度尼西亚政府方面。照会全文如下：印度尼西亚驻华大使馆：
    中华人民共和国外交部向印度尼西亚共和国驻华大使馆致意，并就中国援助印度尼西亚兴建班加兰纺织厂事，申述如下：
    根据一九六一年十月十一日中国和印度尼西亚两国政府签订的经济技术合作协定，中国政府为援助印度尼西亚兴建班加兰厂作出了巨大的努力。中国方面按照有关合同的规定，已发运了八千二百余吨的设备材料，占全部设备材料的百分之七十以上，并派出施工专家帮助建厂。到一九六五年九月为止，这项工程的进展一直是顺利的。
    一九六五年十月以后，印度尼西亚右派反动势力掀起了大规模的反华排华运动，制造了一系列严重的反华排华事件。尽管如此，中国政府为了维护两国人民友谊，尽量克制，继续进行援建工作。中国专家在十分困难的条件下，仍坚持上班。中国政府还通知印度尼西亚政府，在保证安全的条件下，中国准备继续发运设备材料。这一切表明，中国政府对履行两国经济技术合作协定是真诚的、是尽了最大努力的。
    印度尼西亚政府过去一再表示，将采取措施制止反华排华活动，扫除两国经济技术合作的障碍。但是，印度尼西亚右派反动势力的反华排华活动反而愈演愈烈。印度尼西亚右派将领集团夺取政权之后，更其疯狂反华。最近竟发展到公然出动武装部队伙同右派暴徒袭击中国大使馆，打伤中国外交官。中国代表机构和中国人员的安全，已经完全失去保障。很明显，印度尼西亚方面的所做所为，已破坏了两国经济合作的基础，使援建班加兰厂的工作无法继续进行。
    为此，中国政府通知印度尼西亚政府，中国方面不得不中止对班加兰厂的援建工作，并撤回中国专家。中国政府必须指出，两国经济合作关系遭到破坏的责任，完全在印度尼西亚政府方面。
    顺致最崇高的敬意。

                            一九六六年四月十八日于北京
