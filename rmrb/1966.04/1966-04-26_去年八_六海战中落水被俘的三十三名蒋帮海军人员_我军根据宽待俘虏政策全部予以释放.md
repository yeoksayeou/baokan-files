    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 25th: The relevant departments of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently released all thirty-three Chiang Gang naval personnel who were captured after falling into the water when the American-made Chiang ships "Jianmen" and "Zhangjiang" were sunk by our forces in the naval battle of August 6th last year.
    Among the thirty-three released former Chiang Gang naval personnel were Wang Yunshan, former Lieutenant Colonel Captain of the "Jianmen"; Huang Zhijun, former Lieutenant Colonel Operations Officer of the Second Patrol Fleet of the Chiang Gang Navy; Ke Dehui, former Major Reconnaissance Chief of the Chiang Gang Navy Communication Research Office; Li Degang, former Lieutenant Engineering Officer of the "Zhangjiang"; and Xu Changgeng, Li Rongcun, and twenty-nine other Chiang Gang naval soldiers from the "Jianmen" and "Zhangjiang".
    The relevant departments of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, in accordance with our army's consistent policy of lenient treatment of prisoners, decided to release all of the aforementioned captured Chiang Gang naval personnel, provide them with travel expenses to return home, and give them a way to make a living. For Li Degang, Li Rongcun, and eleven other former Chiang Gang naval personnel whose families are in Taiwan Province and who are willing to return, they were released to return to Taiwan to reunite with their families in the spirit of revolutionary humanitarianism.
    During their captivity, these released former Chiang Gang naval personnel received lenient treatment from the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Many of them were only wearing underpants when they were captured, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army promptly provided them with clothing and daily necessities. Some of them were injured and received timely treatment, quickly recovering their health. During this period, the relevant departments of our People's Liberation Army also conducted patriotic education for the captured Chiang Gang naval personnel, explained our army's policy of lenient treatment of prisoners, and organized them to visit factories and rural people's communes. They also helped all captured Chiang Gang naval personnel who had relatives on the mainland find their relatives, restore contact through letters, and some even met with their loved ones.
    These released former Chiang Gang naval personnel expressed their deep gratitude to the Chinese People's Liberation Army for their lenient release.
