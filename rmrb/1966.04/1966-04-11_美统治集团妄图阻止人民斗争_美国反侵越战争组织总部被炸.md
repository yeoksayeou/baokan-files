    New China News Agency, Berkeley, 10th dispatch: Berkeley, California—The headquarters of the "Vietnam Day Committee," an organization actively engaged in the struggle against U.S. aggression in Vietnam, was severely damaged by a powerful bomb planted by reactionaries on the morning of the 9th; at least seven people were injured.
    According to Western news agencies, the explosion could be heard a mile away. The back wall of the building was blown open, and all the glass windows and water and electrical equipment in the building were destroyed. Windows in at least five surrounding buildings were also shattered.
    This is yet another act of terror recently committed by U.S. reactionaries against mass organizations, attempting to use such means to prevent the further development of the people's movement against the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    The "Vietnam Day Committee" was established in early May 1965. Over the course of nearly a year, it actively organized local mass anti-aggression demonstrations, including repeatedly blocking trains carrying U.S. troops to Vietnam, which had a great impact. It was also one of the initiators and main organizers of the "National Day of Protest" and "International Day of Protest" against U.S. aggression in Vietnam last October. Therefore, it has become a thorn in the side of the U.S. reactionary ruling clique.

    美统治集团妄图阻止人民斗争
    美国反侵越战争组织总部被炸
    新华社十日讯　伯克利消息：美国伯克利市（加利福尼亚州）一个积极从事反对美国侵略越南斗争的组织——“越南日委员会”的总部九日上午被反动分子用烈性炸弹炸坏；至少有七人受伤。
    据西方通讯社报道，一英里之外都听见了爆炸的巨响。房屋的后墙被炸开，整幢房屋的玻璃窗和水电设备都被炸坏，周围至少有五幢房屋的窗户也被震坏。
    这是最近一个时期来美国反动分子对群众团体采取的又一个恐怖行动，妄图用这种手段来阻止人民反对侵越战争运动的进一步开展。
    “越南日委员会”是一九六五年五月初成立的。在将近一年的过程中，它积极组织当地群众的反侵越示威，包括多次拦阻运载侵越美军的火车，影响很大。它也是去年十月反对美国侵略越南的“全国抗议日”和“国际抗议日”活动的发起人和主要组织者之一。因此，它成了美国反动统治集团的眼中钉。
