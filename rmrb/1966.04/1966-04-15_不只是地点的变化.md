    Not Just a Change of Location
    The grain supply point in Xiaojiang District, Xinchang County, Zhejiang Province, was located behind a village in a mountainous area, a remote and inconvenient location. It was as if the commune members were walking a winding road to buy rice. The people at the grain management office had also discussed moving the supply point several times, but they couldn't agree. Some were worried that if the supply point was separated from the grain management office located behind the village, they wouldn't be able to find help when work got busy. Others said: The grain management office has a cafeteria, and if the supply point is moved further away, it wouldn't be convenient to eat or get hot water. In January of this year, after the staff studied "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," everyone realized that whether or not to move the supply point, they should first think of the masses. They resolved to move the supply point to the village entrance, which was welcomed by the commune members.
    The relocation of the grain supply point is not just a change of location, but primarily a change in people's thinking. Before the change, when faced with this matter, they first thought of themselves; after the change, they first thought of the masses. Before the change, difficulties that were not insurmountable were not overcome; after the change, the same difficulties were no longer taken seriously. This once again illustrates that if work is to be improved, thinking must be changed first.

    不只是地点的变化
    浙江新昌县小将区粮食供应点，座落在山区一个村背后，地点偏僻，交通不便。社员们买点米，好象走盘陀路。粮食管理所的人也曾几次讨论过供应点搬家的问题，但是意见统一不起来。有人担心供应点和设在村后的粮管所分开，工作一忙，找不到帮手；有的说：粮管所有食堂，供应点搬远了，吃饭、打开水不方便。今年一月，职工们学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》，大家认识到，搬不搬供应点，应该先替群众打算。他们下决心把供应点搬到村口，受到了社员群众的欢迎。
    粮食供应点搬了家，不仅是地点的变动，首先是人的思想的变化。变以前，面对此事，先替自己打算；变以后，首先是替群众打算。变以前，并非不可克服的困难，也不去克服；变以后，同样的困难，人们不再放在眼里。这又一次说明：工作要改善，思想要先改变。
