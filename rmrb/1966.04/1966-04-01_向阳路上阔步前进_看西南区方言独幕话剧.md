    Striding Forward on Xiangyang Road
    ——Watching One-Act Dialect Plays from the Southwest Region
    Feng Zi
    The dialect one-act plays performed in the Southwest Regional Drama Festival are truly a series of good shows. Among the several groups of short plays reporting to Beijing for performance, in addition to a series of short plays performed in a special performance by amateur workers, peasants, and soldiers, "Good Helper" performed by the Rural Cultural Work Troupe of the Dazhou Prefecture of Sichuan and "On Xiangyang Road" performed by the Chengdu City Drama Troupe have also received favorable comments from the audience.

    Concentrating on shaping and praising the shining character images of poor and lower-middle peasants in the countryside who are wholeheartedly for the collective is the outstanding achievement of several one-act plays in character creation. Li Erge, Li Ersao in "On Xiangyang Road", and Li Qunfang in "Good Helper" leave a deep impression on people. These short plays all unfold conflicts and resolve conflicts through the actions of positive characters, which provides conditions for the ideological transformation of the characters being criticized. Taking "On Xiangyang Road" as an example, because the spiritual outlook of the positive characters Li Erge and Li Ersao are written with relatively profound depth, the ideological gap between Doctor Chen and the poor and lower-middle peasants, as well as his ideological changes before and after going to the countryside, are also relatively profoundly excavated.

    As soon as the play opens, a clap of thunder brings the characters into the designated situation – mountain area, summer, before dawn. Li Erge rushes to the courtyard in the thunder. A sound and an action powerfully render the feelings of the poor and lower-middle peasants for collective production, and the feelings of the mountain farmers for rain. In the pouring rain, Li Erge, regardless of his ulcerous leg and the dark and slippery road, picks up a hoe and goes to block the pond. Within a few minutes of the opening, the image of a people's commune member who is wholeheartedly for the collective and fighting in the mountains is established. Concern for production and for the collective cause runs through Li Erge's entire actions, and it is precisely the noble class feelings of Li Erge and Li Ersao that enlightened and educated Doctor Chen and nurse Xiao Liang.

    This short play successfully uses the contrast technique, which concentrates and enriches the plot, and is concise and interesting, greatly enhancing the dramatic and comedic color, and achieving very good artistic effects.

    Doctor Chen broke his leg on the mountain road, Li Erge helped him home, and actively looked for medicinal wine to treat Doctor Chen's leg; Doctor Chen never thought that Li Erge was the patient with ulcers that he had irresponsibly sent away a year ago. This is a contrast in the plot arrangement, and this plot arrangement is very clever. Although Doctor Chen responded to the Party's call and went to the countryside, and also realized a little of the suffering of the peasant brothers, it was only through the comparison of Li Erge's noble qualities of wholeheartedly serving the collective and his strong class feelings for comrades that he truly compared the gap between his own thoughts and feelings and the thoughts and feelings of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

    When Doctor Chen found out that Li Erge recognized him, and with Xiao Liang's encouragement, was preparing to examine himself, but he couldn't let go of his airs and couldn't tear off his mask, in this scene, the description of the petty-bourgeois intellectuals' psychology of personal gains and losses is detailed and subtle. However, when Li Ersao learned that Doctor Chen was the irresponsible doctor in the big city hospital she had criticized to his face, she immediately apologized to Doctor Chen straightforwardly. The frank mind of the poor and lower-middle peasants is as broad as the sea. This is a contrast in character depiction.

    The section, that dialogue between Doctor Chen and Li Erge leaves people with thought-provoking questions. Isn't it true that to solve the problem of rural medical and health work, and to solve the ideological transformation problem of medical personnel – including all intellectuals – the only good prescription is Mao Zedong Thought. The artistic treatment of this play is very clean, simple, and vivid, and the ending is implicit but not obscure. The audience fully believes that intellectuals like Doctor Chen will definitely stride forward in the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers! The ideological and artistic achievements of "On Xiangyang Road" and other one-act plays are precisely the gains of drama workers going deep into the reality of life and struggle and combining ideological transformation.

    In terms of performance, it is very successful, especially the actors who played Li Erge and Li Ersao, who acted naturally, simply, vividly, and realistically. The tone of the character of Doctor Chen is not low, as Xiao Liang said, his performance in the countryside is good, and this is also what makes this script different from the general. It is a pity that the actor feels a little restrained in his grasp of the character.

    Other plays and other characters cannot be discussed one by one due to space limitations. (Attached picture)
    The irresponsible doctor criticized by Li Ersao is precisely Doctor Chen in front of her.

### 向阳路上阔步前进——看西南区方言独幕话剧

    向阳路上阔步前进
    ——看西南区方言独幕话剧
    凤子
    西南区戏剧汇演中演出的方言独幕话剧，真是好戏连台。在来京汇报演出的几组小戏中，最受观众欢迎的，除了工农兵业余专场演出一台小戏外，四川达县专区农村文化工作团演出的《好帮手》和成都市话剧团演出的《向阳路上》也都获得了观众的好评。
    集中地塑造和歌颂农村中贫下中农一心为集体的闪闪发光的人物形象，是几个独幕话剧在人物创造上出色的成就。《向阳路上》里的李二哥、李二嫂，《好帮手》里的李群芳，给人们的印象是深刻的。这些小戏都是通过正面人物的行动来展开矛盾、解决矛盾，这就为被批判人物的思想转变提供了条件。以《向阳路上》为例，由于正面人物李二哥、李二嫂的精神面貌写得比较有深度，所以相应地也就比较深刻地挖掘出陈医生和贫下中农之间的思想差距，以及他下乡前后的思想变化。
    戏一开幕，一声响雷，就把人物带进到这样的规定情景——山区、夏天，黎明之前。李二哥在雷声中奔到院坝。一个音响，一个动作，都有力地渲染了贫下中农对集体生产的感情，山区农民渴望雨水的感情。倾盆大雨中，李二哥不顾连疮病腿，不顾天黑路滑，拿起锄头，就去堵堰塘。开幕不几分钟，一个一心为集体、斗争在山区的人民公社社员的形象就树立起来了。对生产，对集体事业的关心，贯串在李二哥的整个行动中，正是李二哥和李二嫂的崇高的阶级感情启发教育了陈医生和护士小梁。
    这出小戏成功地运用了对比手法，既集中、丰富了情节，又精炼有趣，大大增强了戏剧性和喜剧色彩，取得了很好的艺术效果。
    陈医生在山道上摔坏了腿，李二哥扶他回家，并积极为陈医生找药酒治腿；陈医生那想到李二哥正是他一年前不负责任打发的那个害连疮的病人。这是情节安排上的一个对比，这样的情节安排是非常巧妙的。陈医生响应党的号召、下到农村，虽然也体会到一点农民兄弟的疾苦，可是通过李二哥那一心为集体的高贵品质，和对同志强烈的阶级感情的对比，才真正比出自己思想感情和贫下中农的思想感情之间的差距。
    当陈医生发现李二哥认出了自己，在小梁的鼓励下，准备检讨时，可是又放不下架子、撕不开面子，在这一场戏里，对小资产阶级知识分子的个人得失心理的描写是细致入微的。可是，当李二嫂知道了陈医生就是她当面批评的城里大医院里的那个不负责任的大夫时，马上开门见山地向陈医生道歉。贫下中农的坦率胸怀真是海一样的开阔。这是人物性格描写上的对比。
    陈医生和李二哥的那段戏，那段对话，给人留下值得深思的问题。不是吗，要解决农村医疗卫生工作问题，要解决医务人员——包括一切知识分子的思想改造问题，唯一的好方子，就是毛泽东思想。这个戏艺术处理很干净，朴素，生动，结尾含蓄而又不隐晦，观众完全相信陈医生这样的知识分子，一定会沿着工农兵方向阔步前进！《向阳路上》等几个独幕话剧所获得的思想上艺术上的成就，也正是戏剧工作者深入生活斗争实际、结合思想改造的收获。
    就演出来说，是十分成功的，特别是扮演李二哥、李二嫂的演员同志，演得自然、朴素、生动、真实。陈医生这个人物的基调是不低的，正如小梁所说，下乡来表现的不错，这也是这个剧本创作上不同于一般之处。可惜演员对人物的掌握还感到有点拘束。
    其他戏，其他人物，限于篇幅，不能一一论及。（附图片）
    李二嫂批评的那个不负责任的医生，恰恰就是她面前的陈医生。
