    Shangjia Commune overcame the erroneous thoughts of slackening work and the rise of personal considerations among cadres and commune members after a good harvest, and enhanced everyone's awareness of doing a good job in spring plowing.
    According to the Heilongjiang Daily, the Shangjia Commune Party Committee in Zhaodong County, taking class struggle as the key link, strengthened ideological and political education, and improved the socialist consciousness of the vast number of cadres and commune members, thus promoting spring plowing and production.
    Last year, Shangjia Commune achieved a substantial increase in grain crops, and cash crops and animal husbandry also developed significantly. Some commune and team cadres developed complacency and arrogance, believing that with a bumper harvest, work would be easier. They relaxed political work, and their enthusiasm for leading production was not as strong as before. A few team cadres even planned to live comfortably themselves, unwilling to be cadres and worry and suffer.
    A bumper harvest is a good thing, but why are some people's enthusiasm not as high as before? Why has the idea of personal gain risen? With this question in mind, the Commune Party Committee studied "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and Chairman Mao's discourses on highlighting politics. They realized that some cadres and commune members had lost their way in the face of the bumper harvest, unable to withstand the test. With more grain and more money, they only cared about their own small families, only cared about improving their current lives, disregarding long-term construction, collective interests, and national interests, and unwilling to work hard and continue to move forward. This is a reflection of the struggle between two roads and two ideologies.
    In response to this situation, the Commune Party Committee criticized the erroneous idea that "with a bumper harvest and improved living standards for the masses, the peasants will naturally be willing to take the socialist road, and work will be easier" at the joint meeting of the brigade Party branch secretaries. It pointed out that in the face of an excellent situation, it is even more necessary to highlight politics, educate the peasants with Mao Zedong Thought, guide the peasants to continuously broaden their horizons, care about the collective, care about the country, care about the world revolution, and adhere to the socialist road.
    Subsequently, the Commune Party Committee also focused on class education and socialist education. Through holding exhibitions, organizing the study of Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds, and carrying out recollection and comparison activities, and recalling the bitterness of the past and thinking about the sweetness of the present, the class consciousness of the vast number of Party members, cadres, and poor and lower-middle peasants was enhanced. They realized that only caring about personal interests would not consolidate the collective economy and would lead to a return to the old path. Only caring about immediate interests would not build a new socialist countryside and would not support national construction and world revolution. Everyone expressed: We must adhere to the socialist direction and do a good job in spring plowing and production with greater efforts.
    When people have revolutionary spirit, they can continuously tap the potential of production. The Hongqing Brigade originally thought that there was enough manure fertilizer. After finding the gap with other fraternal teams, they tapped into new sources of manure and accumulated more than 700,000 catties of manure fertilizer. Hongguang, Shangjia, Hongming, and other three brigades are rushing to erect power transmission lines and are also seizing the time to dig wells, preparing to irrigate wheat fields to prevent wheat "necking drought." As of April 3, the entire commune had sown more than 3,700 mu of spring wheat, with base fertilizer applied during plowing. Most production teams also applied chemical fertilizer during sowing, and the quality of sowing was generally better than in previous years.

    生产好了更要突出政治
    尚家公社克服了丰收后干部和社员中的工作松劲、个人打算抬头的错误思想，提高了大家搞好春耕生产的自觉性
    据黑龙江日报消息　肇东县尚家公社党委以阶级斗争为纲，加强思想政治教育工作，提高了广大干部、社员的社会主义觉悟，促进了春耕生产。
    去年，尚家公社粮食作物大幅度增产，经济作物和畜牧业也有较大的发展。部分社、队干部产生了骄傲自满情绪，认为有了大丰收，工作好做了，放松了政治工作，领导生产的劲头也不如过去足了；少数队干部甚至打算自己过舒舒服服的日子，不愿再当干部操心受累了。
    大丰收是好事，为什么有些人的劲头反而不如以前呢？为个人打算的思想抬头了呢？公社党委带着这个问题，学习了《中国社会各阶级的分析》和毛主席有关突出政治的一些论述，认识到这是有些干部和社员在大丰收面前迷失了方向，经受不住考验，粮多、钱多了，就只顾个人小家庭，只顾改善当前生活，不顾长远建设，不顾集体利益和国家利益，不愿艰苦奋斗，继续前进了。这是两条道路、两种思想斗争的反映。
    针对这种情况，公社党委在大队党支部书记联席会上，批评了那种认为“大丰收了，群众生活改善了，农民会很自然地愿意走社会主义道路，工作好做了”的错误思想；指出在大好形势面前，更需要突出政治，用毛泽东思想教育农民，引导农民不断放宽眼界，关心集体，关心国家，关心世界革命，坚持走社会主义道路。
    接着，公社党委又狠抓阶级教育和社会主义教育，通过举办展览，组织学习焦裕禄同志的事迹和开展回忆对比、忆苦思甜活动，提高了广大党员干部和贫农下中农的阶级觉悟。他们认识到，只顾个人利益，就不能巩固集体经济，就要走回头路；只顾眼前利益，就不能建设社会主义新农村，就不能支援国家建设和世界革命。大家表示：一定要坚持社会主义方向，用更大的力量搞好春耕生产。
    人有了革命精神，就能不断挖掘生产潜力。红庆大队原来认为粪肥已经够了，经过和其他兄弟队找差距后，又挖掘粪源，多积攒了七十多万斤粪肥。红光、尚家、红明等三个大队正在架设输电线路，还抓紧打井，准备往麦田里灌水，预防小麦“掐脖旱”。到四月三日，全公社已播完春小麦三千七百多亩，翻地时普遍施了底肥，多数生产队在播种时又施了化肥，播种质量也普遍好于往年。
