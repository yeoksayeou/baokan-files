    Chairman Mao teaches us: “Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary; whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism is a counter-revolutionary.” On which side, then, does Comrade Wu Han stand?
    In old China, the people suffered cruel oppression under reactionary rule and were plunged into misery. Inspired people of the Chinese nation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, waged successive and desperate struggles. But Wu Han prostrated himself before Hu Shi, a reactionary politician and comprador writer, and exhausted his efforts for the personal goals of scholars and professors seeking fame and fortune.
    During the Ten-Year Civil War, Wu Han also used history as a metaphor to advise the executioner Chiang Kai-shek not to regard the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army as a “minor ailment,” but to “pacify while suppressing,” offering advice and strategies to the Kuomintang reactionaries to eliminate the revolutionary armed forces. During the Anti-Japanese War, Wu Han disregarded the nation’s peril and vigorously praised, beautified, and followed Chiang Kai-shek, hoping to win favor from the reactionary ruling class in order to obtain an official position. Even more detestable, he used the lessons of the Ming Dynasty's demise as a warning, advising Chiang Kai-shek to “use all his strength to eliminate” the Communist Party and the people’s armed forces it led.
    During the Liberation War, Wu Han, in the guise of so-called "people," falsely accused the sacred cause of liberation of the Chinese people as "two parties fighting," with "the people suffering." Conversely, he greatly praised the reactionary figures of American imperialism, such as Truman and Marshall, who helped Chiang Kai-shek massacre the Chinese people, sincerely expressing that he would never forget American imperialism’s “great contributions in Chinese history.”
    Facts show that throughout the entire historical period of the democratic revolution led by the Party, Wu Han did not stand on the side of the people, but consistently stood on the side of the three major enemies, launching a frantic attack on the revolutionary people as a de facto employed writer of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule.
    Chairman Mao teaches us: “Intellectuals who harbor hostile sentiments towards our country are a very small minority. These people do not like our proletarian dictatorship; they yearn for the old society. Given the opportunity, they will stir up trouble, wanting to overthrow the Communist Party and restore the old China.” Wu Han is such an intellectual who harbors hostile sentiments toward us.
    Even before the founding of our country, he said: “We must learn” from America’s “democratic methods.” He once dreamed of building a “free world.” Wu Han's "ideal" was shattered. Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have firmly embarked on the road of proletarian dictatorship. Comrade Wu Han could not help but feel regret about this.
    As the saying goes, paper cannot contain fire, and sores will always fester. When the climate and soil are suitable, demons and monsters will always come out and stubbornly express themselves. During the period from 1959 to 1961, when domestic right-leaning opportunists were launching large-scale attacks on the Party, Wu Han's poisonous weeds, such as *Hai Rui Mocks the Emperor* and *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office*, emerged one after another. Wu Han used the past to criticize the present. It was our beloved Party that he vehemently denounced through the mouths of ancient people. It was the right-leaning opportunists we despised that Wu Han praised and glorified.
    We want to sternly warn Wu Han: Your wishful thinking is wrong. Today's workers, peasants, and soldiers, today's revolutionary people, are no longer the "common people" who accomplish nothing in your mind. We are the masters of the new China. We are determined to take the broad road of socialism! With the great Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, we will surely be able to thoroughly expose your reactionary face.

### 吴晗站在哪方面？

    吴晗站在哪方面？	戴东生
    毛主席教导我们：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。”吴晗同志究竟是站在哪一方面呢？
    旧中国，人民饱受反动统治的残酷压迫而沦于水深火热之中，中华民族的有志之士在中国共产党的领导下，前仆后继地进行着殊死的斗争。可是吴晗却拜倒在反动政客买办文人胡适的门下，为学者教授成名成家的个人奋斗目标而费尽心机。
    十年内战时期，吴晗又借古喻今，提醒刽子手蒋介石不要把工农红军看成是“疥癣之疾”，要“以抚济剿”，为国民党反动派消灭革命武装而出谋献计。抗日战争时期，吴晗置民族危亡而不顾，极力吹捧美化和追随蒋介石，想以此博得反动统治阶级的青睐以求得一官半职。更可恶的是，他还以明朝灭亡教训为鉴，进言蒋介石“用全力来消灭”共产党和它所领导的人民武装。
    解放战争期间，吴晗竟以所谓“人民”的资格，诬蔑中国人民神圣的解放事业是“两党打仗”，“人民受罪”。反之，对于帮助蒋介石屠杀中国人民的美帝国主义的反动头子杜鲁门、马歇尔之流，他却备加赞赏，诚心诚意地表示决不忘记美帝国主义“在中国历史上的伟大功绩”。
    事实表明，中国人民在党的英明领导下所进行的整个民主革命的历史时期内，吴晗并没有站在人民的方面，而是自始至终站在三大敌人方面，作为国民党反动统治事实上的御用文人向革命人民进行猖狂进攻。
    毛主席教导我们说：“对于我们的国家抱着敌对情绪的知识分子，是极少数。这种人不喜欢我们这个无产阶级专政的国家，他们留恋旧社会。一遇机会，他们就会兴风作浪，想要推翻共产党，恢复旧中国。”吴晗就是对我们抱敌对情绪的知识分子。
    还在我们建国以前，他就说过：“我们得学学”美国的“民主方式”。他曾经幻想建设一个“自由世界”。吴晗的“理想”破灭了。中国人民在党和毛主席的英明领导下，坚定地走上了无产阶级专政的道路。对此，吴晗同志不无饮恨。
    俗语说，纸包不住火，疮总要流脓，牛鬼蛇神在气候土壤适宜的时候总要出来顽强地表现自己。在一九五九年到一九六一年期间，正当国内右倾机会主义分子大肆向党进攻之时，吴晗的《海瑞骂皇帝》、《海瑞罢官》等毒草就相继出笼了。吴晗借古非今，他通过古人之口大骂的不是别人，正是我们敬爱的党。吴晗所歌颂美化的正是我们所唾弃的右倾机会主义分子。
    我们要正告吴晗：你的如意算盘打错了。今天的工农兵，今天的革命人民，已不是你心目中的无所作为的“小百姓”了，我们是新中国的主人。社会主义这条康庄大道我们是走定了！我们有着伟大的毛泽东思想做武器，就一定能够彻底揭穿你的反动嘴脸。
