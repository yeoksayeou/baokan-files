    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 20th -- The U.S. Department of Defense announced on the 19th that the United States will further draw troops from Western Europe back to the United States, with the total number of troops transferred reaching 30,000 or more.
    This is a step taken by the United States to draw troops from Western Europe to strengthen and expand the war of aggression against Vietnam in the event of insufficient troops. Prior to this, the U.S. Department of Defense had already announced that among the personnel withdrawn from Western Europe, 15,000 would be used to establish new units, train recruits, and rotate U.S. military personnel in the South Vietnam battlefield for the war of aggression against Vietnam. According to Western news agencies, another 15,000 people will also be transferred back to the United States because their "terms of service" in Western Europe have "expired."
    American newspapers acknowledge that many of the U.S. troops being transferred are veterans and specialized technical personnel. Therefore, the quantity and quality of U.S. troops stationed in Europe are declining.

    为加强和扩大侵越战争
    美国又将从西欧抽调大批兵力
    新华社二十日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国防部十九日宣布，美国将进一步从西欧抽调兵力返回美国，抽调的总数将达三万人或三万人以上。
    这是美国在兵力不足的情况下从西欧抽调兵力来加强和扩大侵越战争而采取的步骤。在这以前，美国国防部已经宣布，在从西欧抽调的人员中，一万五千人将用来为侵越战争建立新的部队、训练新兵和轮换在南越战场的美军人员。据西方通讯社报道，另外一万五千人由于在西欧“服役期满”，也将一起调回美国。
    美国报刊承认，在这些抽调的美军中，许多是老兵和专门技术人员。因此，驻欧美军的数量和质量都正在下降。
