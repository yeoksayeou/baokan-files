    U.S. Imperialism Intensifies Military Provocations Violating Our Territorial Waters and Airspace
    I Issue the 400th Serious Warning to the United States
    If U.S. imperialism insists on imposing war on the Chinese people, insists on engaging in another contest with the Chinese people, the Chinese people are determined to contribute, together with the people of the world, to the complete burial of U.S. imperialism.
    Xinhua News Agency, April 5th: From 04:28 to 12:07 on April 5th, a U.S. warship intruded into our territorial waters east of the Min River Estuary in Fujian Province. Regarding this military provocation by the U.S. warship, the spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs was instructed to issue the 400th serious warning.
    Xinhua News Agency, April 5th: Our correspondent reports: Today, a U.S. imperialist warship once again intruded into our territorial waters east of the Min River Estuary in Fujian Province. The spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs was instructed to issue the 400th serious warning against this barbaric act of aggression by the United States. Since September 1958, when the Chinese government issued its first serious warning against the crimes of U.S. warships and aircraft invading our territorial waters and airspace, U.S. imperialism has, for more than seven years, conducted such frequent and continuous blatant military provocations against China. This is an undeniable proof of U.S. imperialism's persistence in its policy of aggression and its war policy. These rampant acts of aggression by U.S. imperialism seriously threaten China's security and also seriously threaten peace in Asia and the world.
    The activities of U.S. imperialism in sending its warships and military aircraft to intrude into China's territorial waters and airspace have become more frequent year by year, the areas have expanded year by year, and the circumstances have become more serious year by year. Since June 29, 1964, when a U.S. submarine intruded into the sea area south of Pinghai, Guangdong Province, and conducted military provocations, and the spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs was instructed to issue the 300th serious warning, in just one year and nine months, U.S. imperialism has sent warships 128 times, involving 160 intrusions, into our territorial waters. In the month with the most intrusions, U.S. warships intruded into our territorial waters 21 times, involving 32 vessels. It has sent military aircraft 82 times, involving 81 planes, into our airspace, including April 1965, when U.S. military aircraft intruded into our airspace as many as 21 times, involving 23 planes. In the recent one year and more, the number of times U.S. warships have invaded our territorial waters is nearly twice as many as during the period from May 4, 1962, to June 29, 1964, when our country issued the 201st to 300th serious warnings to the United States. U.S. military aircraft have intruded into our airspace and even blatantly penetrated into the airspace over Sheyang, Yancheng, Rugao in Jiangsu Province, and Hekou in Yunnan Province. U.S. military unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft have also repeatedly intruded into the airspace over our central-south and southwest regions to carry out reconnaissance and provocation activities. U.S. fighter planes intruding into areas such as Yaxian on Hainan Island have openly launched attacks on our planes taking off for alert duty. U.S. warships and aircraft have also rampantly shelled, strafed, and pursued our fishing boats and merchant ships at sea many times, seriously endangering the lives of our personnel and causing serious property damage. These facts clearly show that U.S. imperialism is the irreconcilable enemy of the Chinese people. It is constantly threatening China with war. The debts owed to the Chinese people by the U.S. bandits are accumulating more and more.
    These aggressive activities of U.S. imperialism are being carried out against the background of its shift of the focus of its counter-revolutionary global strategy from Europe to Asia, with the aim of being hostile to the Chinese people to the end and preparing to launch a larger-scale war of aggression in Asia. U.S. Secretary of State Rusk admitted in October 1964: "The main problem of U.S. foreign policy at present is how to deal with China... the problem of having nuclear weapons in hand." Last February, U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara even more bluntly clamored that China is the main enemy of the United States today. In the past year, while drastically increasing its troops in South Vietnam and intensifying its war of aggression against Vietnam, U.S. aggressors have greatly intensified their military deployment around China, establishing a so-called "crescent arc" encirclement from South Korea through Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, South Vietnam, Thailand, "Malaysia," all the way to India. It is reported that the United States is currently building a large naval and air base, the largest in Asia, at Cam Ranh Bay in South Vietnam, which, together with the bases in Thailand and Laos, constitutes a military base system aimed at China.
    At the same time, U.S. imperialism is also stepping up its activities to turn our Taiwan Province into a base for expanding its war of aggression in Asia. In collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, it signed the so-called "Status of Forces Agreement," expanded the Kungkuan Airport and other military bases in Taiwan, and expanded the U.S. 13th Task Force Air Force stationed in Taiwan into the 327th Air Division, greatly increasing the number of U.S. Air Force personnel stationed in Taiwan and transferring a large number of U.S. aircraft. U.S. Vice President Humphrey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Wheeler, Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Armed Forces Sharp and Felt, and U.S. Ambassador to Saigon Lodge and other senior military and political leaders have also visited Taiwan one after another to plan and instigate the Chiang Kai-shek clique to "counterattack the mainland" and "open up a second battlefield." Wheeler held talks with Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang's military leaders in Taiwan on the situation of the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam and the "strengthening of cooperation between the United States and Chiang." Felt clamored in Taipei that the United States is willing to risk "the danger of war" with China to pursue its policy of expanding its aggression in Southeast Asia. In the past year or so, U.S. intelligence agencies have also instigated U.S.-Chiang armed agents to carry out harassment and sabotage activities against our southeastern coast on many occasions. These facts show that U.S. imperialism's aggressive and bellicose nature will never change. In order to promote its policy of aggression and war policy and realize its wild ambition to dominate the world, U.S. imperialism is actively planning to launch a larger-scale war of aggression in Asia.
    U.S. imperialism's persistence in its policy of aggression and war policy, and its insistence on being an enemy of the great Chinese people will absolutely not end well. Since the Chinese government issued its 300th serious warning against U.S. aggression against our territorial waters and airspace, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has shot down two intruding U.S. fighter planes and captured a U.S. military pilot alive; shot down nine U.S. imperialist military unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft and five U.S.-made Chiang gang U-2 and RF-101 aircraft; and sunk three U.S.-made Chiang gang warships and damaged two. During this period, our coastal military and civilians laid a dragnet and resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilated many groups of U.S.-Chiang armed agents. These are just a few lessons the Chinese people have given to the U.S. aggressors and their running dogs. Debts must be settled. If U.S. imperialism dares to continue its aggression, it will surely be subjected to even more severe punishment.
    The Chinese people love peace, but they are not afraid of war. If U.S. imperialism insists on imposing war on the Chinese people, insists on engaging in another contest with the Chinese people, then let it be. The Chinese people are always prepared for a sudden attack that U.S. imperialism may launch. The Chinese people are determined to contribute, together with the people of the world, to the complete burial of U.S. imperialism, the chief culprit of war, in the just war against U.S. imperialist aggression.

    美帝国主义侵犯我领海领空的军事挑衅更加扩大和加剧
    我对美国提出第四百次严重警告
    如果美帝硬要把战争强加在中国人民头上，硬要同中国人民再来一次较量，中国人民决心同全世界人民一道为彻底埋葬美帝国主义而做出贡献
    新华社五日讯　四月五日四时二十八分至十二时零七分，美国军舰一艘，侵入我福建省闽江口以东地区领海。对于美国军舰的这种军事挑衅，我外交部发言人奉命提出第四百次严重警告。
    新华社五日讯　本社记者报道：今天，美帝国主义的军舰一艘又在我福建省闽江口以东地区侵入我国的领海。我国外交部发言人奉命对美国这种野蛮的侵略罪行提出第四百次严重警告。自从一九五八年九月中国政府对美国军舰、飞机侵犯我国领海领空的罪行发出第一次严重警告以来，七年多中，美帝国主义这样频繁连续地对中国进行明目张胆的军事挑衅，这是美帝国主义坚持侵略政策和战争政策的不可抵赖的罪证。美帝国主义这种猖狂的侵略活动，严重地威胁着中国的安全，也严重地威胁着亚洲和世界和平。
    美帝国主义派遣它的军舰和军用飞机侵犯中国领海领空的活动，次数一年比一年频繁，地区一年比一年扩大，情节一年比一年严重。从一九六四年六月二十九日美国潜水艇一艘侵入我国广东省平海以南地区海域进行军事挑衅，我外交部发言人奉命提出第三百次严重警告以来，到现在仅仅一年零九个月时间，美帝国主义就派遣了军舰一百二十八艘、一百六十次侵入我国领海，最多的一个月，美国军舰有二十一艘、三十二次侵入我国领海；派遣了军用飞机八十二架、八十一次侵入我国领空，其中一九六五年四月份，侵入我领空的美国军用飞机就有二十一架、二十三次之多。在最近一年多时间内，美国军舰侵犯我国领海的次数，比一九六二年五月四日到一九六四年六月二十九日，我国对美国提出第二百零一次到第三百次严重警告期间，多了将近两倍。美国军用飞机侵犯我国领空，甚至明目张胆地深入到我江苏省射阳、盐城、如皋和云南省河口等地区上空。美国军用无人驾驶高空侦察机还多次侵入我中南和西南地区上空，进行侦察挑衅活动。侵入我海南岛崖县等地区的美国战斗机，公然对起飞警戒的我机发动进攻。美国军舰和飞机还猖狂地在海上多次炮击、扫射和追踪我渔船和商船，使我人员的生命安全受到严重威胁，财产受到严重损失。这些事实清楚地表明，美帝国主义是中国人民不共戴天的死敌。它无时无刻不在对中国进行着战争威胁。美国强盗对中国人民欠下的罪债正在越积越多。
    美帝国主义的这些侵略活动，是在它把它的反革命全球战略的重点从欧洲转移到亚洲的背景下进行的，目的是要同中国人民为敌到底，准备在亚洲发动一场更大规模的侵略战争。美国国务卿腊斯克一九六四年十月就承认：“美国目前对外政策的主要问题是如何对付中国……手中有核武器的问题”。去年二月，美国国防部长麦克纳马拉更露骨地叫嚣：中国是今天美国的主要敌人。美国侵略者在过去一年中，在大举增兵南越，加紧扩大侵略越南战争的同时，大大加紧了它在中国周围的军事部署，建立了一个从南朝鲜经过日本、台湾、菲律宾、南越、泰国、“马来西亚”、直到印度的所谓“新月形弧线”的包围圈。据报道，美国目前正在南越金兰湾兴建一个亚洲最大的海空军基地，它同泰国和老挝的基地联系起来，构成矛头针对中国的军事基地体系。
    与此同时，美帝国主义还在加紧把我国的台湾省变为它在亚洲扩大侵略战争的基地的活动。它勾结蒋介石集团签订了所谓“美军在华地位协定”，在台湾扩建了公馆机场和其他军事基地，并且把侵驻台湾的美国第十三特遣航空队扩大为第三二七空军师，大量增加侵台美国空军人员，调进了大批美国飞机。美国副总统汉弗莱，参谋长联席会议主席惠勒，太平洋地区武装部队总司令夏普和费尔特，以及美国驻西贡“大使”洛奇等高级军政头目，也接二连三地跑到台湾，策划和怂恿蒋介石集团“反攻大陆”和“开辟第二战场”。惠勒在台湾曾同蒋介石和蒋军头目就美国侵略越南战争局势和美蒋“加强合作问题”举行了会谈。费尔特在台北叫嚷美国愿冒同中国“发生战争的危险”来推行它扩大侵略东南亚的政策。一年多来，美国的特务机关还指使美蒋武装特务，多次对我东南沿海进行骚扰破坏活动。这些事实表明，美帝国主义的侵略和好战的本性是永远不会改变的。美帝国主义为了推行它的侵略政策和战争政策，实现其独霸全世界的狂妄野心，正在积极策划在亚洲发动一场更大规模的侵略战争。
    美帝国主义坚持侵略政策和战争政策，坚持与伟大中国人民为敌，是绝对不会有好下场的。自从中国政府对美国侵犯我领海领空的侵略罪行提出第三百次严重警告的一年多以来，中国人民解放军又击落了入侵的美国战斗机两架，并活捉美军飞行员一名；击落了美帝国主义军用无人驾驶高空侦察机九架和美制蒋帮U—2型、RF—101型等飞机五架；击沉了美制蒋帮军舰三艘、击伤二艘。这期间，我沿海军民撒下天罗地网，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地歼灭了美蒋武装特务多股。这些只不过是中国人民给美国侵略者及其走狗的一点教训而已。欠债必须清算。美帝国主义胆敢继续进行侵略活动，必将受到更加严厉的惩罚。
    中国人民是爱好和平的，但决不害怕战争。如果美帝国主义硬是要把战争强加在中国人民头上，硬是要同中国人民再来一次较量，那就请吧。对于美帝国主义可能发动的突然袭击，中国人民是时刻准备着的。中国人民决心在反对美帝国主义侵略的正义战争中，同全世界人民一道，为彻底埋葬美帝国主义这个战争的罪魁祸首，做出自己应有的贡献。
