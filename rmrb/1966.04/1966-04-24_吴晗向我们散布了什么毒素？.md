	What Poison Has Wu Han Spread to Us?

	On May 24, 1963, Comrade Wu Han, in his capacity as a Chinese historian and the chairman of the Beijing Historical Society, gave us a report titled "Current Development of Historiography and Several Issues in Historical Research." Here, we will only discuss how Comrade Wu Han wanted us to study classical Chinese and its harmful effects.

	How did Comrade Wu Han want us to study history?

	Comrade Wu Han said: "Classical Chinese is a key to unlocking the treasure house of our motherland's history. Without understanding classical Chinese, there is no basis for studying and researching history. Because, apart from some modern and contemporary history, all historical books and materials are written in classical Chinese, and the language of the ancients is very different from that of us today. Therefore, to read books, collect materials, and research history, one must first master classical Chinese. Only then can one open the vast treasure house of our motherland's history. What method can be used to master classical Chinese? I think there is only one way, and that is to read more, memorize more, spend a year or two, work hard, select thirty or forty articles of different types from 'Guwen Guanzhi' and 'Zizhi Tongjian,' and memorize them desperately, without letting go of a single word or sentence. This way, you can grasp the rules of classical Chinese and be able to read other classical literature."

	The students in our class, whose foundation in classical Chinese was relatively weak, under the deception of Comrade Wu Han, once set off a craze for finding ancient books, buying ancient books, reading ancient books, memorizing ancient books, and copying ancient books. In order to find a few ancient books, some students even used their vacation time to return home from Guangxi, Yunnan, Qinghai, Guizhou and other places, and brought back a large pile of ancient books such as "Youxue" and "Four Books." After a period of hard work and "running around," almost everyone got a few ancient books. Many students, in order not to "fall behind," spent their days squatting in the library, cramming ancient books to death. Some students even used more than two-thirds of their self-study time to learn classical Chinese.

	Of course, we are not generally opposed to learning classical Chinese. For those who study history, it is necessary to master a certain amount of classical Chinese knowledge. Our fundamental difference with Wu Han is not about whether or not to study or how much to study classical Chinese, but about whether historical scientific research should be guided by Mao Zedong Thought or by classical Chinese. Wu Han vainly attempted to use classical Chinese to replace Mao Zedong Thought, which fully exposed his stubborn adherence to the landlord and bourgeois class standpoint. He wanted to use this to lure the broad masses of young people away from the guidance of great Mao Zedong Thought and into the maze he had arranged. Moreover, classical Chinese is not a simple combination of words without class content, but something written by feudal literati reflecting their political stance and expressing their thoughts and feelings. Therefore, the study of classical Chinese must be carried out critically under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Only in this way can we know for whom to study classical Chinese, why to study classical Chinese, and can we enter and exit without losing our way. Wu Han's advocacy of "not letting go of a single word or sentence" and "memorizing desperately" was aimed at leading us astray. Under the deception of Comrade Wu Han, some of our students did desperately memorize, "not letting go of a single word or sentence." For example, when studying "Biography of Li Zicheng," they also recited without criticism the feudal historians' slander of Li Zicheng as "... his voice was like a jackal, his nature was suspicious and cruel, he killed people every day, and cutting off feet and dissecting hearts was his amusement." They also recited the lament of Emperor Chongzhen, who was surrounded by the peasant revolutionary war at that time: "... The emperor left the palace, ascended Coal Hill, saw beacon fires all over the sky, and sighed: 'It is bitter for my people!' He lingered for a long time." Class viewpoint and class feelings became increasingly weak.

	In this way, some of our students were once led by the nose by Comrade Wu Han, spending their days buried in ancient books, unable to get out, developing a sense of boredom towards political theory study, regarding labor and social work as a burden, and relaxing their ideological remolding. This is the result of Comrade Wu Han's "teachings"!

	Now we realize that this is a method used by Comrade Wu Han to oppose Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and a method used by Comrade Wu Han to poison young people. Wu Han's words and deeds must be countered. We must join the battle and thoroughly criticize Wu Han's reactionary stance and ideology.

### 吴晗向我们散布了什么毒素？

    吴晗向我们散布了什么毒素？	中央民族学院学生　白正顺（傈僳族）　杨必繁（白族）
    一九六三年五月二十四日，吴晗同志曾以中国历史学家、北京市历史学会会长的身份给我们作了题为《当前史学的发展和史学研究中的几个问题》的报告。这里只谈谈吴晗同志是要我们怎样学习古文及其恶劣的影响。
    吴晗同志要我们怎样学习历史呢？
    吴晗同志说：“古文是打开祖国历史宝库的一把钥匙，不懂古文就根本谈不上学习和研究历史。因为除了部分近代史和现代史之外，所有的历史书籍资料都是用古文写成的，而古人的语言又和我们今人的大不相同，因此要看书，要收集资料，要研究历史，就必须先掌握古文。然后才能打开浩如烟海的祖国历史宝库。用什么方法可以掌握古文呢？我看办法只有一个，那就是多读、多背，花上一两年的时间，狠下苦功夫，从《古文观止》、《资治通鉴》中选出不同类型的三四十篇文章，拼命地背，不要放过一字一句。这样，就可以掌握古文的规律，就可以阅读其他古典文献资料了。”
    我们班里的同学，古文基础比较差，在吴晗同志的欺骗之下，曾一度掀起了找古书、买古书、读古书、背古书、抄古书的热潮。为了找到几本古书，有的同学还利用假期回家的时间，从广西、云南、青海、贵州等地，找回《幼学》、《四书》等一大堆古书。经过一番辛苦和“奔波”之后，几乎每个人都弄到几本古书了。不少同学为了不“落伍”，整天蹲在图书馆里死啃古书。有的同学甚至把三分之二以上的自习时间都用来学习古文。
    当然，我们并不是笼统地反对学习古文。对于学习历史的人说来，掌握一定的古文知识是必要的。我们跟吴晗的根本分歧不在于要不要学习或者多学少学古文的问题，而在于历史科学的研究中究竟是以毛泽东思想挂帅还是以古文挂帅的问题。吴晗妄图用古文来代替毛泽东思想，这正充分暴露了他顽固地坚持地主资产阶级的立场。他想借此诱骗广大青年离开伟大毛泽东思想的指引，钻进他所布置的迷魂阵里去。并且，古文并不是没有阶级内容的简单的文字组合，而是封建文人写的反映其政治立场、表达其思想感情的东西。因此学习古文，必须在毛泽东思想的指导下，批判地进行学习。只有这样，才能知道为谁学习古文，为什么学习古文，才能进得去，出得来，不致于迷失方向。吴晗向我们鼓吹“不放过一字一句”“拼命地背”，其居心就在于要把我们引入歧途。在吴晗同志的诱骗之下，我们一些同学确实拼命地背，“不要放过一字一句”地背了。例如学到《李自成传》时，对于封建史学家对李自成“……声如豺，性猜忍，日杀人，斮足剖心为戏”这样的诬蔑，也未加批判地背诵。对于当时崇祯皇帝处于农民革命战争的包围之中而发出的哀叹“……帝出宫，登煤山，望烽火彻天，叹息曰：‘苦我民耳！’徘徊久之”，也照样背诵。阶级观点，阶级感情，日益淡薄。
    这样，我们有些同学曾一度被吴晗同志牵着鼻子走路，整天钻在古书堆里，进去了出不来，对于政治理论学习产生了厌倦情绪，把劳动和社会工作看作是一种累赘负担，放松了自己的思想改造。这就是吴晗同志“教导”我们的结果！
    现在我们认清了，这是吴晗同志反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的一种手法，是吴晗同志毒害青年的一种手法。对吴晗的言行，必须予以回击。我们要投入战斗，彻底批判吴晗的反动立场和思想。
