    Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd—Bakary Traoré, head of the National Union of Journalists of Mali delegation, pointed out at the Fourth Plenary Meeting (enlarged) of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association on the 22nd that imperialists are determined to create an intolerable situation in Africa, which is the reason for the many coups, riots, and subversion waves occurring in Africa.
    He said that Mali will soon teach imperialism and its agents a lesson. We have long understood that there is a life-and-death issue between imperialism and us. We would rather risk a head-on conflict with our enemies than cowardly retreat and kneel before them. Experience has shown that people are usually overthrown precisely because of retreat.
    Speaking of the current situation, Bakary Traoré said that the resounding victories of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front in Asia and the heroic resistance of the people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, on the one hand, make us all feel proud and encouraged, and on the other hand, provide us with ample reasons to absolutely believe in our own strength and sincerely believe that we will eventually be victorious.
    He said that we firmly believe that all collusion between imperialists and racists cannot prevent the heroic Vietnamese people from driving out the aggressors and their running dogs.
    He said that imperialists desperately oppose the forces that truly represent political expression. The most advanced systems in Africa are, without exception, targets of imperialist conspiracies. The dates for overthrowing the systems of certain countries (including our own) have already been set. However, the desire for national independence and progress will guide the masses of the people to thwart these vile conspiracies.
    Bakary Traoré concluded by saying that our friend Chawodo and all his collaborators, as well as all Asian-African democratic and revolutionary journalists, can rely on the National Union of Journalists of Mali in any situation. It will spare no sacrifice to contribute to the victory of our common cause, which is our solemn duty.

    马里记协代表团团长特拉奥雷的发言
    马里人民决不在帝国主义面前退却
    新华社二十三日讯　马里全国新闻工作者联合会代表团团长巴卡里·特拉奥雷，二十二日在亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议（扩大）上发言时指出，帝国主义者决心在非洲制造无法忍受的局势，这是非洲发生的许多政变、出现的骚乱和颠覆浪潮的原因。
    他说，马里不久将教训帝国主义及其代理人。我们长期以来就已经懂得，帝国主义和我们之间有着一个生死存亡的问题。我们宁愿冒同我们的敌人发生正面冲突的危险，而不愿向他们屈膝怯懦地退却。经验证明，人们通常被推翻正是由于退却之故。
    巴卡里·特拉奥雷在谈到当前形势时说，在亚洲，越南南方民族解放阵线的响亮的胜利，越南民主共和国人民的英勇抵抗，一方面使我们大家为之而感到自豪和鼓舞，另一方面也给我们提供了充分的理由，以便绝对相信我们自己的力量，真诚相信我们最后将会胜利。
    他说，我们坚决相信，帝国主义者和种族主义者之间的一切勾结都防止不了英勇的越南人民把侵略者及其走狗赶走。
    他说，帝国主义者拼命地反对真正的政治上表态的力量。非洲最先进的各种制度都毫无例外地是帝国主义阴谋的目标。推翻某些国家的制度（其中包括我们国家）的日期都已确定好了。但是，民族独立和进步的愿望将引导人民群众去挫败这些卑鄙的阴谋。
    巴卡里·特拉奥雷最后说，我们的朋友查禾多和他的所有的合作者以及所有亚非民主和革命的新闻工作者，在任何情况下都可以信赖马里新闻工作者全国联合会，它将不惜任何牺牲为我们共同事业的胜利作出贡献，这是我们庄严的义务。
