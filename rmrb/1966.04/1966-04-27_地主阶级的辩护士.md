    The film "Catching Strong-Arm Laborers" is a bad film. It revolves around the "sadness" and "worries" of the landlord Li Laoshuan's family, and promotes the idea that the landlord class was also exploited and oppressed in old China. The film completely distorts the objective reality of old China.
    The film uses a great deal of space to write about the "poverty" of the landlord Li Laoshuan's family. It says things like "Tomorrow is the Mid-Autumn Festival, and there is nothing in the house," "This year, not even a liter of glutinous rice has been prepared, and there isn't a single penny on hand. Such a large family will have to 'hang up the pot and use it as a bell' (go hungry)." In the end, they have to borrow from Wang Mazi, the bao chief.... Strangely, the poor peasant Jiang Guofu is "very rich" and can even pay Li Laoshuan a thousand yuan in cash to plead for his son to avoid being drafted; he can also give gifts to Li Laoshuan's family. The landlord Li Laoshuan in the film is so "poor" that he is not even as good as his tenant Jiang Guofu.
    The film tirelessly and repeatedly writes about the "oppression" of Li Laoshuan's family: The landlord Li Laoshuan has three sons. After the eldest son left (in reality, he also became a "soldier"), the second son (a smoker) was initially targeted. Although he was not drafted, he was extorted by Wang Mazi, the bao chief. But before long, Li Laoshuan's third son was targeted. The third son, fearing being drafted, was forced to wear a Young Pioneer uniform and participate in the Young Pioneers. Li Laoshuan once said to Wang Mazi, the bao chief: "My third son has already paid three thousand yuan in conscription fees," "And now it's been put on my name again!" Please see, the film repeatedly propagates to the audience: The landlord Li Laoshuan is a "victim of oppression," a "bullied person."
    The film also writes about the bao chief Wang Mazi extorting the landlord Li Laoshuan again and again – rather than extorting the peasants. The bao chief Wang Mazi seems not to exist to maintain the interests of the landlord class, but entirely to exploit the family of landlord Li Laoshuan. Bao chief Wang Mazi spends all his time around Li Laoshuan's family: collecting conscription fees, eating and drinking, lording over Li's family, squeezing oil from Li Laoshuan's family, and eyeing Li's "clever daughter-in-law," the third sister-in-law. Everyone knows that the bao chiefs in old society villages were the lackeys of the landlord class. But where is Wang Baochang in the film a lackey of the landlord class? He is simply the mortal enemy of the landlord Li Laoshuan's family.
    From the "sadness" and "worries" of the landlord Li Laoshuan's family, from the constant complaints of Li Laoshuan's family, from the relationship between Wang Baochang and the landlord Li Laoshuan, the director attempts to prove to the audience: The landlord class in old China was a "victim."
    In the evil old society, there were bloody facts of class exploitation and naked facts of class oppression. In Sichuan, there were countless dens of evil like Liu Wencai's Rent Collection Courtyard, where thousands upon thousands of peasants were brutally exploited and oppressed, leading to ruin, the separation of families, and death. Why couldn't the director see these historical truths, but insisted on fabricating and highlighting the "facts" of the landlord Li Laoshuan's family being assigned donations, assigned funds, and being drafted?
    Just when the Party and Chairman Mao were educating the people of the whole country: Never forget class struggle, never forget the past class exploitation and class oppression, and always remember that the overthrown class enemies are not reconciled to death and are always trying to restore themselves, the director of the film "Catching Strong-Arm Laborers" released such a poisonous arrow, which is by no means accidental. In fact, it is defending the landlord class and singing a duet against the Party.
    In short, I think that the director of the film "Catching Strong-Arm Laborers" deliberately blurs the line between the exploiting class and the exploited class, denies that the landlord is a sinful exploiting class, and defends and complains for the landlord class. It is a poisonous weed that is anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-people, and must be thoroughly criticized.

    地主阶级的辩护士	昆明市岗头村财经学校　何朝训
    影片《抓壮丁》是一部坏影片，它围绕着地主李老栓一家人的“悲”和“愁”，宣扬了地主阶级在旧中国也是受剥削，受压迫的。影片完全歪曲了旧中国的客观现实。
    影片用了极大的篇幅，写地主李老栓一家的“穷困”。说什么“明天就要过中秋节了，家里还样啥都没得”，“今年连一升糯米都没准备，手头一个毛钱都没有。这么一大家子人，要‘吊起锅儿当钟打’（喝西北风）了”。最后只得向王麻子保长借……。奇怪的是，贫农姜国富倒“很有钱”，还能交一千块现款给李老栓代儿子求情，免抓壮丁；还能给李老栓家送礼。影片中的地主李老栓就是这样的“穷”，穷得连他的佃户姜国富都不如。
    影片不厌其烦地、再三地写李老栓一家被“压迫”的情况：地主李老栓有三个儿子，老大出走后（实际也当了“兵”），先抽老二（烟鬼），人虽未被抽走，却被王麻子保长敲了一笔钱。可是不多久，又抽到李老栓的老三身上。老三怕被抽壮丁，而被迫穿上了童子军服，参加了童子军。李老栓就曾对王麻子保长说过：“我老三才出了三千块钱的壮丁费”，“又搞到我名下来啦！”请看，影片就是这样三番五次地向观众宣传：地主李老栓是一个“受压迫者”，“受欺凌者”。
    影片又写保长王麻子，一而再，再而三地去向地主李老栓敲竹杠——而不是向农民敲竹杠。保长王麻子，似乎不是为维护地主阶级的利益而存在，而完全是为了敲榨地主李老栓家而存在似的。王麻子保长成天只知道围着李老栓家转：收壮丁费，吃吃喝喝，在李家一家人面前作威作福，榨榨李老栓家的油水，打打李家“巧媳妇”三嫂子的主意。大家知道，旧社会农村里的保长是地主阶级的狗腿子。可是，影片中的王保长那里是地主阶级的狗腿子，简直成了地主李老栓家的死对头了。
    从地主李老栓一家人的“悲”和“愁”中，从李老栓一家的叫苦连天声中，从王保长和地主李老栓的关系中，编导者企图向观众证明：旧中国的地主阶级是“受害者”。
    在万恶的旧社会，有的是血淋淋的阶级剥削的事实，有的是赤裸裸的阶级压迫的事实。在四川，就有不知多少个象刘文彩收租院那样的魔窟，千千万万的农民被残酷剥削压迫得倾家荡产，妻离子散，家破人亡。为什么编导者看不到这些历史的真实，而偏要编造这么个地主李老栓家被派捐，被派款，被抽壮丁的“事实”大写而特写呢？
    正当党和毛主席教育全国人民：千万不能忘记阶级斗争，千万不要忘记过去的阶级剥削、阶级压迫，千万要记住被推翻了的阶级敌人不甘心死亡，随时都在企图复辟的时候，影片《抓壮丁》的编导者，却放出了这样一支毒箭，绝不是偶然的。实际上是在为地主阶级辩护，是跟党唱对台戏。
    总之，我认为影片《抓壮丁》的编导者是有意模糊剥削阶级与被剥削阶级的界限，否认地主是罪恶的剥削阶级，替地主阶级辩护喊冤。它是一株反党反社会主义反人民的毒草，必须彻底地加以批判。
