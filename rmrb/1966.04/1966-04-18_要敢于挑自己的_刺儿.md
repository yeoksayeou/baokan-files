    Dare to Pick on Your Own "Thorns"
    The quitting-time whistle sounded. Zhang Caiyun, a roving weaver from the B shift of the Xinjiang Textile Factory, walked out of the workshop with a worried look on her face, without a trace of her usual cheerful energy. It turned out that she had produced a tangled bobbin on her shift today. According to regulations, this counts as a defective product and should be deducted ten points in quality. But she didn't tell the quality inspector to record it. She concealed the defect and passed it off as a good product. She couldn't sleep when she lay down in bed at home, and that tangled bobbin stirred up her thoughts. A tangled bobbin sent to the next process would affect the quality of warping. The yarn coming out would be a mess, and the woven cloth would be even worse. She regretted not telling the quality inspector on the shift.
    But, the scene of the sisters discussing the plan at the beginning of the month reappeared, everyone wanted to reduce defective products to the minimum, if I register a defective product, wouldn’t that affect the team’s overall results? ... The more she thought about it, the more confused she became. She couldn't sleep. She thought of the application to join the Party that she had just written. Did her thoughts meet the conditions for a Party member? She thought that a defect is an "enemy," an enemy in thought. When encountering an enemy, one should fight bravely, not surrender. She had not only concealed a bad bobbin, but also let go of a bad thought. She thought of Chairman Mao's words: to serve the people "completely" and "thoroughly," and felt even more ashamed. She finally made up her mind: rather be behind in scores, than be behind in thought. So, she hurriedly put on her clothes, ran to the factory, found the inspector, and asked her to record the defective product according to regulations; then she found the Party branch to examine her mistake.
    Zhang Caiyun's noble style of exposing her own defective products and taking the initiative to revolutionize herself moved the sisters in the same group. Du Xiufang, the leader of the trade union group, encouraged her: "It's not scary to produce a defective bobbin, as long as you strictly demand yourself ideologically in the future, you will produce fewer defective products." After listening to the report, the branch leader did not criticize her, but called on everyone to learn from Zhang Caiyun's spirit of self-revolution in not letting go of bad thoughts, and announced that they would not record the defective point against her. This made Zhang Caiyun very touched.
    This incident caused a great shock among the workers and greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses for conscious revolution. Many people took the initiative to examine the individualistic thoughts of concealing defective products in the past. Zhang Caiyun's revolutionary sense of responsibility became stronger, and she didn't produce any defective products for eighty consecutive days, and the quality of the bobbins reached 100%. In the past two months or so, the defect rate in the winding process has been reduced by more than two-thirds compared with the past. The workers said: "The more you dare to expose defects, the fewer there will be; the more you dare not expose them, the more there will be." (Guo Jie)
    Defects are the flaws of yarn and cloth. They appear on the yarn and cloth, but the root is in people's thoughts. To eliminate the "defects" on yarn and cloth, we must first eliminate the "defects" in thought. How to eliminate them? We should be like Zhang Caiyun, dare to pick on our own "thorns," and dare to expose our own "defects." The workers said well: "The more you dare to expose defects, the fewer there will be; the more you dare not expose them, the more there will be." This is the voice of experience.
    We advocate conscious revolution, and Zhang Caiyun is worthy of being a conscious revolutionary in this matter. Consciousness means being clearly and proactively responsible to the Party and to the revolution. If you only revolutionize in matters that others can detect, and muddle through in matters that others cannot easily detect, how can this be considered conscious?
    The Party branch did not criticize her, nor did they record the defective point against her, but praised her and called on everyone to learn from her, which was very right. Zhang Caiyun's courage to expose her own "defects" is a great advantage. With this advantage, she will produce fewer "defects" in production in the future; if everyone learns from her advantage, they will also produce fewer "defects" in production in the future. That is to say, Zhang Caiyun's ideological advantage is greater than the defect on her yarn, how can we record the defective point against her, how can we not praise her?
    A textile worker inevitably produces some defects in spinning and weaving. People in other positions also inevitably produce various different "defects" in their work. Should we adopt the method of concealing our own "defects" like Zhang Caiyun did at the beginning? Or should we resolutely expose them and eliminate them like Zhang Caiyun did later? This is a touchstone for testing whether a person consciously transforms their thinking and is consciously responsible for the cause of socialism.

### 要敢于挑自己的“刺儿”

    要敢于挑自己的“刺儿”
    下班的汽笛响了。新绛纺织厂乙班络经挡车女工张彩云满面愁容走出了车间，往常那种说说笑笑的劲头连影儿也没有了。原来，她在今天班上出了一个乱线筒子，按规定这算次品，应该在质量上扣十分。但她没有告诉质量检查员登记，就把疵点掩饰过去，当做正品交了。她回家躺在床上怎么也睡不着，那个乱线筒子把她的思想搅得乱哄哄的。一个乱线筒子送到下道工序，就会影响整经的质量，浆出纱来是一团，织出布来就更糟了。她后悔没有在班上告诉质量检查员。
    可是，姐妹们月初讨论计划的情形又闪现出来，大家要把次品降低到最少的程度，我要登记了次品，不就要影响全组的成绩吗？……她越想，心里越是乱。她再也睡不着了。她想起了刚刚写过的入党申请书，自己的思想合乎党员条件吗？她想，疵点就是“敌人”，是思想上的敌人。遇到敌人应该勇敢战斗，而不该屈服投降。自己不仅是隐瞒了一个坏筒子，而且是放过了一个坏思想。她想到毛主席的话：要“完全”、“彻底”地为人民服务，更觉得非常惭愧。她终于下了决心：宁肯在分数上落后，决不能在思想上落后。于是，急忙穿起衣服，跑进工厂，找到了检查员，要她按规定记上次品；又找到了党支部，检查了自己的错误。
    张彩云这种自己揭露自己的次品，主动革自己命的高尚风格，感动了同组的姐妹，工会组长杜秀芳鼓励她说：“出了次品筒子不怕，只要今后从思想上严格要求自己，就会少出次品。”支部领导听了汇报，也没有批评她，还号召大家向张彩云不放过坏思想的自我革命精神学习，并且宣布不给她记疵点分。这使得张彩云非常感动。
    这件事情，在工人中引起了很大震动，大大激发了群众自觉革命的积极性，不少人都主动检查了过去隐瞒次品的个人主义思想。张彩云的革命责任心更强了，她连续八十天没出次品，筒子质量达到百分之百。近两个多月来，络经工序的疵点分，比过去降低了三分之二还多。工人们说：“疵点，越敢于揭露它就越少，越不敢揭露它就越多。”　（郭洁）
    疵点，是纱和布的毛病。它是出在纱和布上，根子却在人的思想上。要消灭纱和布上的“疵点”，首先得消灭思想上的“疵点”。如何消灭？应该象张彩云那样，敢于挑自己的“刺儿”，敢于揭露自己的“疵点”。工人们说得好：“疵点，越敢于揭露它就越少，越不敢揭露它就越多。”这是经验之谈。
    我们提倡自觉革命，张彩云在这件事情上，不愧为一个自觉革命者。自觉，就是清醒地、主动地对党、对革命负责。如果在别人能发觉的事情上就革命，在别人不容易发觉的事情上就蒙混，这怎么能算自觉呢？
    党支部没有批评她，没有给她记疵点分，而是表扬了她，并且号召大家学习她，做得很对。张彩云勇于揭露自己的“疵点”，这是一个很大的优点。她有了这个优点，以后在生产上就会少出“疵点”；大家学习她这个优点，以后在生产上也会少出“疵点”。这就是说，张彩云思想上的优点，大于她的纱上的疵点，怎么能给她记疵点分，怎么能不表扬她呢？
    一个纺织工人，在纺纱织布中，难免不出一些疵点。其它岗位上的人，在自己的工作中，也难免要出各种不同的“疵点”。对自己的“疵点”，是象张彩云开头那样，采取掩藏的办法呢？还是象张彩云后来那样，坚决地揭露它，消灭它呢？这是考验一个人是不是自觉地改造思想，是不是自觉地对社会主义事业负责的一块试金石。
