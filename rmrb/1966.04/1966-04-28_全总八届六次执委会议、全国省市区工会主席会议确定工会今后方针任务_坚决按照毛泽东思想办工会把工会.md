    Xinhua News Agency, April 26th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions recently held successively a meeting of chairmen of trade unions of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, and the Sixth Session of the Eighth Executive Committee, discussing the guiding principles and tasks of trade unions for the future and current work issues. Party and state leaders Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, and others received all the comrades attending the meeting of chairmen of trade unions of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, giving everyone great encouragement. Leading comrades of the Party Central Committee also gave extremely important and extremely clear instructions on trade union work, which deeply inspired and educated the comrades attending the meeting, greatly enhancing their confidence in doing a good job. Comrade Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, also made an important speech at the meeting. The meeting believes that according to the needs of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction, and according to the instructions of the leading comrades of the Party Central Committee, trade unions must, under the leadership of the Party, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take class struggle as the key link, vigorously highlight politics, learn from the People's Liberation Army, learn from Daqing, and use Chairman Mao's military building thought to build China's workforce into a highly proletarianized, revolutionary, and combat-effective industrial army, and make trade unions a school for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in a living way.
    The comrades attending the meeting of chairmen of trade unions of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions also participated in the National Industrial and Transportation Work Conference and the National Industrial and Transportation Political Work Conference, listened to important reports by Comrades Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping, listened to speeches by Comrade Bo Yibo and reports by Comrade Tao Lujia, and listened to speeches by advanced units such as Daqing Oilfield and six advanced figures such as Wang Jinxi, greatly enhancing their understanding of running enterprises with Mao Zedong Thought and strengthening their overall perspective.
    After deeply studying the instructions of the leading comrades of the Party Central Committee, the meeting realized that highlighting politics means highlighting Mao Zedong Thought, which means running trade unions according to Mao Zedong Thought. Whether or not trade unions are run according to Mao Zedong Thought is a fundamental issue concerning the path trade unions take, and it is a fundamental issue concerning whether to carry out the socialist revolution to the end and prevent revisionism. The practice of trade union work proves that whenever we act according to Mao Zedong Thought, the work is vigorous and can become a powerful assistant to the Party; whenever we deviate from Mao Zedong Thought even slightly, the work will inevitably be done poorly, or even lose its direction. If trade unions are to fully play a combat role in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, they must take Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, vigorously improve trade union work, and improve the thinking of trade union cadres, especially leading cadres.
    The meeting recognized that building a revolutionary industrial army with Mao Zedong Thought is of extremely important significance. The human factor is primary, and the greatest combat effectiveness is people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Once China's millions of workers better grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they can overcome any difficulties on the road ahead and constantly push China's revolutionary and construction undertakings to new victories. Therefore, the trade union, as a school for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in a living way, must, under the leadership of the Party, coordinate with administrative and other relevant departments to take on the task of building this industrial army well.
    The meeting emphasized that Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the highest and most living Marxism-Leninism, and the highest instruction for all work. Now, a new era has begun in which the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers directly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, and the political consciousness of the broad masses of workers has greatly improved through studying Chairman Mao's works. In order to further revolutionize the broad masses of workers, trade unions must put the organization of workers to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way at the top of all work, constantly improve class consciousness, and fully mobilize their enthusiasm. All trade union cadres, especially leading cadres, must take the lead in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought well, transform their own world outlook, and become propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought and good fighters of Chairman Mao.
    The meeting believes that all trade union business work must put politics in command and strictly act according to Mao Zedong Thought. Everything must be conducive to preventing capitalist restoration, consolidating and developing socialism. In doing anything, trade unions must not only consider tens of millions of workers, but also the people of the whole country, especially the 500 million peasants. The existing rules and regulations of trade unions, wherever they hinder highlighting politics, hinder gradually narrowing the differences between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and between mental and manual labor, and are not conducive to the combination of workers and peasants, the combination of urban and rural areas, and the ideological revolutionization of workers, must be reformed step by step, relying on the masses and after pilot projects.
    The meeting emphasized that it is necessary to resolutely resist and eliminate certain systems and practices in trade union work that do not conform to Mao Zedong Thought with a thorough revolutionary spirit. Those foreign frameworks that only engage in construction, not revolution, only focus on production, not class struggle, emphasize material incentives, do not want politics in command, only focus on business, and do not focus on people's ideological work are completely wrong. Without thoroughly breaking these things, Mao Zedong Thought cannot be truly implemented. It should be seen that Chinese trade unions, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, have their own glorious tradition. We must hold the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought high and break everything that does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, so that China's trade unions can march forward along the road indicated by Mao Zedong Thought.
    The meeting requested that trade unions at all levels must conscientiously implement democratic centralism, conscientiously organize the activities of workers' representative conferences, and strengthen mass supervision. It is necessary to frequently listen to the opinions of the masses, and boldly, faithfully, and promptly reflect them to the Party. Good situations should be reflected, bad situations should also be reflected, and principled issues should be reflected even more, so that trade unions truly become a link between the Party and the masses, and become an unobstructed channel for the Party to understand the situation and implement policies.
    The meeting pointed out that Daqing Oilfield is a model of running enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought. Trade unions should cooperate with relevant departments to do a good job in mass work, carry out the mass movement of learning from Daqing, creating "five goods," comparing, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing. Strive to increase production and practice economy, implement technological innovation and technological revolution, vigorously support agriculture, actively support national defense, ensure key construction, and strive to over fulfill the 1966 national economic plan and the Third Five-Year Plan.
    The meeting believes that the grassroots level is the foothold of all work. The tasks of trade unions must be implemented at the grassroots level and realized through the grassroots level. The experience of trade union work must also be created at the grassroots level. Trade union work is mainly grassroots work. Therefore, leading organs of trade unions at all levels must face the grassroots level, vigorously grasp grassroots work, grasp it firmly, and grasp it to the end.
    The meeting finally called on trade union cadres to take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example, study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, constantly promote ideological revolutionization, persist in participating in labor, maintain close ties with the masses, carry forward the style of hard struggle, and serve the Chinese people and the people of the world wholeheartedly.
    The meeting listened to the experience introductions from the Daqing Oilfield Trade Union, the Hunan 3517 Factory Trade Union, the Henan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, and the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and also listened to the experience introduction from Zheng Yongqin, a worker at the Fuzhou First Printing Factory, on persisting in amateur study for fifteen years. The comrades attending the meeting believed that these experiences are all very good and worthy of serious study.

    全总八届六次执委会议、全国省市区工会主席会议确定工会今后方针任务
    坚决按照毛泽东思想办工会把工会
    办成活学活用毛泽东思想的学校　把职工队伍建成革命化的产业大军
    新华社二十六日讯　中华全国总工会最近相继举行了省、市、自治区工会主席会议和第八届执行委员会第六次会议，讨论了工会今后的方针任务和当前的工作问题。党和国家的领导人刘少奇、周恩来、邓小平等接见了参加省、市、自治区工会主席会议的全体同志，给大家以极大的鼓舞。党中央领导同志还对工会工作作了极为重要、极为明确的指示，使到会同志受到了深刻的启发和教育，大大增强了做好工作的信心。全国总工会主席刘宁一同志也在会议上作了重要讲话。会议认为，根据我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的需要，根据党中央领导同志的指示，工会必须在党的领导下，更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，以阶级斗争为纲，大力突出政治，大学解放军，大学大庆，用毛主席的建军思想，把我国职工队伍建成一支非常无产阶级化、革命化、战斗化的产业大军，使工会成为活学活用毛泽东思想的学校。
    出席省市自治区工会主席会议的同志，还同时参加了全国工业交通工作会议、全国工业交通政治工作会议，听了周恩来同志、邓小平同志的重要报告，听了薄一波同志的讲话和陶鲁笳同志的报告，听了大庆油田等先进单位和王进喜等六位先进人物的发言，大大提高了对于用毛泽东思想办企业的认识，增强了全局观点。
    会议在深入学习了党中央领导同志的指示以后认识到，突出政治，就是突出毛泽东思想，就是要按照毛泽东思想办工会。按照不按照毛泽东思想办工会，是关系到工会走什么道路的根本问题，关系到是否把社会主义革命进行到底、防止修正主义的根本问题。工会工作的实践证明：什么时候按照毛泽东思想办事，工作上就生气勃勃，就能够成为党的有力助手；什么时候只要稍一离开毛泽东思想，工作就必然做不好，甚至迷失方向。工会要在阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动中充分发挥战斗作用，就必须以毛泽东思想为指针，大力改进工会工作，提高工会干部尤其是领导干部的思想。
    会议认识到，用毛泽东思想建设革命化的产业大军，具有极为重要的意义。人的因素第一，最大的战斗力是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人。我国千百万工人群众一旦更好地掌握了毛泽东思想，就可以克服前进道路上的任何困难，把我国的革命事业和建设事业不断地推向新的胜利。因此，工会作为活学活用毛泽东思想的学校，就是要在党的领导下，协同行政等有关方面，把建设这支产业大军的任务很好地担当起来。
    会议强调指出，毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是最高最活的马克思列宁主义，是一切工作的最高指示。现在广大工农兵直接掌握毛泽东思想的新时代开始了，广大职工通过学习毛主席著作，政治觉悟有了很大的提高；为了进一步使广大职工革命化，工会必须把组织职工活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，不断提高阶级觉悟，充分调动他们的积极性。全体工会干部，特别是领导干部，要带头学好用好毛泽东思想，改造好自己的世界观，使自己成为毛泽东思想的宣传员、毛主席的好战士。
    会议认为，工会各项业务工作，都必须政治挂帅，严格按照毛泽东思想办事，一切要有利于防止资本主义复辟、巩固和发展社会主义。工会做任何事情，不仅要考虑到几千万工人，而且要考虑到全国人民，特别是五亿农民。工会现行的规章制度，凡是妨碍突出政治，妨碍逐步缩小工农差别、城乡差别、脑力劳动和体力劳动差别，不利于工农结合、城乡结合，不利于职工思想革命化的，要依靠群众，经过试点，逐步加以改革。
    会议强调指出，必须以彻底的革命精神，坚决抵制和清除工会工作中某些不符合毛泽东思想的制度和做法，那些只搞建设，不搞革命，只抓生产，不抓阶级斗争，强调物质刺激，不要政治挂帅，只抓业务，不抓人的思想工作等洋框框，是完全错误的。不彻底破除这些东西，就不能真正贯彻毛泽东思想。应当看到，中国工会在毛泽东思想的指导下，有着自己的光荣传统，我们一定要把毛泽东思想红旗举得高高的，把一切不符合毛泽东思想的东西破得光光的，使我国工会沿着毛泽东思想所指引的道路阔步前进。
    会议要求各级工会都必须认真贯彻执行民主集中制，认真组织好职工代表大会的活动，加强群众监督。要经常听取群众意见，并且大胆、忠实、及时地向党反映。好的情况要反映，坏的情况也要反映，原则问题更要反映，使工会真正成为党联系群众的纽带，成为党了解情况，贯彻政策的一条畅行无阻的渠道。
    会议指出，大庆油田是按照毛泽东思想办企业的典范。工会要配合有关方面，做好群众工作，开展学大庆创五好的比学赶帮超运动。努力增产节约，实行技术革新、技术革命，大力支援农业，积极支援国防，保证重点建设，为超额完成一九六六年的国民经济计划和第三个五年计划而奋斗。
    会议认为，基层是一切工作的落脚点，工会的任务都要落实到基层，通过基层去实现，工会工作的经验，也要在基层创造，工会工作主要就是基层工作。因此，工会各级领导机关必须面向基层，狠抓基层工作，抓住不放，一抓到底。
    会议最后号召工会干部要以焦裕禄同志为榜样，活学活用毛主席著作，不断促进思想革命化，坚持参加劳动，密切联系群众，发扬艰苦奋斗的作风，全心全意为中国人民和世界人民服务。
    会议听取了大庆油田工会、湖南三五一七工厂工会河南省总工会、上海市总工会的经验介绍，还听了福州第一印刷厂工人郑永钦坚持业余学习十五年的经验介绍。与会同志认为，这些经验都很好，值得认真学习。
