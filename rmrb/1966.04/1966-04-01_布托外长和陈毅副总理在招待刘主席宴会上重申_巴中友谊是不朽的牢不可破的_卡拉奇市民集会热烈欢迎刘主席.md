    Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, March 30th. Pakistani Foreign Minister Bhutto reiterated on the 30th that Pakistan's friendship with China "is immortal, unbreakable, and cannot be haggled over or sold."

    Bhutto made these remarks during a toast at a banquet he and his wife hosted here on the evening of the 30th for Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife.

    He said: "Pakistan-China friendship has historical and geographical roots. It stems from a desire for world peace and tranquility. The Pakistani people's desire for this friendship can be proven at any time."

    Speaking on the Kashmir issue, Bhutto said: "We will never abandon the just cause of self-determination for the people of Jammu and Kashmir. Our territory is not large, and our resources are few, but justice is on our side, and regardless of the disparity in strength, no matter what forces are against us, justice will be served."

    Speaking about Chairman Liu Shaoqi's visit, he said: "These precious days they have spent with us have left an unforgettable impression on the hearts of the Pakistani people."

    He said: "In Rawalpindi, in Lahore, and today in Karachi, our people have expressed to Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and through him to the great Chinese people, our respect for the support they have given to Pakistan, and the gratitude for the support they gave to Pakistan during the September war when we were subjected to armed aggression by a habitual aggressor."

    He said: "The Chinese government and people have also announced their firm support for the right of self-determination of the people of Jammu and Kashmir. During their visit, they reiterated in the clearest terms their determination to continue to oppose aggression, support the victims of aggression, and resolutely support the right of self-determination of the people of Jammu and Kashmir."

    Vice Premier Chen Yi, following Foreign Minister Bhutto's toast, expressed his heartfelt thanks for Foreign Minister Bhutto's company during the visit and the warm hospitality extended to him.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi said: "Under the leadership of His Excellency President Ayub Khan, Pakistan adheres to an independent and autonomous policy, which has led to significant development in the friendly relations between China and Pakistan. Foreign Minister Bhutto has made valuable contributions in this regard. We hope that both sides will work together to consolidate and develop the friendly relations between the two countries, and that the people of both countries will be more determined to sympathize and support each other in the struggle against aggression."

    Vice Premier Chen Yi said: "Tomorrow, we will conclude our visit to West Pakistan. We will bring the very warm friendship of the people of West Pakistan towards the Chinese people back to China. We are eagerly looking forward to visiting East Pakistan in the near future."

    Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out: "The current international situation is very complex. As to whether the aggressors will continue to show off their military might towards China and Pakistan in the future, it does not depend on us, but on the aggressors. We hope they will know when to retreat in the face of difficulty. If they dare to attack Pakistan again, all the Chinese people will certainly stand by your side and repel their attacks."

    Both speeches were repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic applause from those present.

    More than four hundred guests attended the banquet. When Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife, accompanied by Foreign Minister Bhutto and his wife, entered the banquet hall, the entire audience stood up and burst into a storm of applause.

    Among the guests attending the banquet were Pakistani Minister of Industry and Natural Resources Ataf Hussain, Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission Syed Hassan, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Cornelius, Foreign Affairs Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Aziz Ahmed, Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Navy Vice Admiral A.R. Khan, as well as other senior officials and prominent figures from all walks of life.

    Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, March 30th. The Karachi Municipal Committee, the largest city in Pakistan, held a civic reception here at Jinnah Park on the afternoon of the 30th to warmly welcome Chairman Liu Shaoqi. Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi said at the meeting to the Pakistani people (for the full text of the speech, see page 3): "In your struggle to safeguard national independence, oppose foreign interference and aggression, the 650 million Chinese people will always be your most reliable friends."

    When Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife, Vice Premier Chen Yi and his wife, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, and other Chinese guests arrived at the venue accompanied by Pakistani Foreign Minister Bhutto and his wife, as well as Minister of Industry and Natural Resources Ataf Hussain, approximately five thousand people attending the reception stood up to welcome them. Enthusiastic crowds, including girls wearing brightly colored red, silver, and gold national costumes, lined the park entrance all the way to the beautifully decorated rostrum, emitting deafening cheers. Colorful balloons with red gauze, bearing the words "Long Live China-Pakistan Friendship," floated in the sky above the venue.

    Vice Chairman of the Karachi Municipal Committee, Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq Khan, delivered a welcome speech. He said: The citizens of Karachi are very pleased to have this opportunity to express their sincere respect to Chairman Liu Shaoqi and their friendship and neighborly feelings to the Chinese people.

    Speaking on Pakistan-China relations, he said: "The signing of important boundary treaties, as well as trade and cultural agreements between the two countries, has opened up new prospects for mutual cooperation and understanding."

    He said: "The people of Pakistan deeply appreciate the just stance of the Chinese people and government in supporting the right of self-determination of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, a right that both India and Pakistan have pledged to give them."

    He said: "The people of Pakistan also value the role China has played in promoting Afro-Asian solidarity based on consolidating national independence and enhancing self-reliance and peace."

    He said: When the Kashmiri patriots launched their freedom movement and Pakistan was subjected to India's naked aggression, China fulfilled its moral obligation of friendship and good neighborliness, which the people of Pakistan can indeed never forget.

    Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq Khan announced at the end of his speech that he, on behalf of the Karachi Municipal Committee, was bestowing the highest civic honor, "Freedom of the City of Karachi," on Chairman Liu Shaoqi.

    He also presented Chairman Liu Shaoqi with the silver key of the Karachi Municipal Committee, symbolizing that the entire city was open to Chairman Liu Shaoqi.

    In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi emphasized that the friendship between the people of China and Pakistan has stood the test of adversity and has proven to be strong and reliable.

    Speaking on the mutual support between China and Pakistan in international affairs, he pointed out: "This mutual support is the reliable foundation of the deep friendship between our two peoples."

    He said: "Karachi plays a pivotal role in the friendly exchanges, economic cooperation and trade between China and Pakistan. At the moment the Chinese economic and trade exhibition is being held in your city. Tens of thousands of people visit it every day, which fully demonstrates the friendship of the Pakistani people toward China. We are pleased to see that in recent years, trade between the two countries has increased many times over and economic cooperation has rapidly strengthened."

    He also said: "The economic and trade relations between our two countries are built on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, mutual exchange of goods, and mutual support. This relationship is conducive to the development of our respective national economies, enabling us to more effectively resist imperialist exploitation, plunder, and control."

    Vice Premier Chen Yi's speech was repeatedly interrupted by storms of sustained applause.

    卡拉奇市民集会热烈欢迎刘主席
    新华社卡拉奇三十日电  巴基斯坦外交部长布托三十日重申，巴基斯坦同中国的友谊
  “是不朽的、是牢不可破的，它是不能讨价还价或出卖的”。
    布托的这番话是在他和他的夫人三十日晚间在这里为刘少奇主席和夫人举行的宴会上祝酒时讲的。
    他说：“巴中友谊是有历史和地理根源的。它出于对世界和平和安宁的愿望。巴基斯坦人民对这种友谊的意愿随时随刻都可以找到证明。”
    布托在谈到克什米尔问题时说：“我们决不会放弃查谟和克什米尔人民自决的正义事业。”我们的版图不大，资源也少，但是正义是在我们这边，不管力量悬殊，不管什么力量与我们为敌，正义是一定会得到伸张的。”
    他在谈到刘少奇主席这次访问时说：“他们同我们一起度过的这些宝贵的日子，在巴基斯坦人民心坎上留下了难忘的印象。”
    他说：“在拉瓦尔品第，在拉合尔，今天在卡拉奇，我国人民向刘少奇主席，并通过他向伟大的中国人民，表示了我们对他们给予巴基斯坦的支持，对他们在我们遭到一贯的侵略者的武装侵略的九月份战争中，给予巴基斯坦的支持的敬意和感激的心情。”
    他说：“中国政府和人民还宣布，他们坚决支持查谟和克什米尔人民的自决权利。在他们这次访问期间，他们以最明确的话重申，他们决心继续反对侵略，支持被侵略者，坚决支持查谟和克什米尔人民的自决权利。”
    陈毅副总理继布托外交部长祝酒时，表示衷心感谢布托外交部长陪同他进行访问和殷勤招待的盛情厚谊。
    陈毅副总理说：“巴基斯坦在阿尤布总统阁下的领导下，坚持独立自主的政策，使中巴两国友好关系取得了显著的发展。在这方面布托外长阁下作出了宝贵的贡献。希望我们双方共同努力，使两国的友好关系更加巩固，更加发展，在反对侵略的斗争中两国人民更加坚决的相互同情相互支持。”
    陈毅副总理说：“明天我们就要结束在西巴基斯坦的访问。我们将把西巴基斯坦人民对中国人民的非常热烈的友情带回中国。我们热烈地期待着不久以后到东巴基斯坦进行访问。”
    陈毅副总理指出：“目前的国际局势是很复杂的。今后的局势，侵略者是不是还要向中国，向巴基斯坦，炫耀武力这个问题，不取决于我们，取决于侵略者，希望他们能够知难而退。如果他们敢于再向巴基斯坦进攻，我们全中国人民一定站在你们一边，打退他们的进攻。”
    两人的讲话都一再被在场的人的热烈掌声所打断。

    当刘少奇主席和夫人、陈毅副总理和夫人、外交部副部长章汉夫和其他中国客人在巴基斯坦外交部长布托和夫人以及工业和自然资源部长阿塔弗·侯赛因陪同下到达会场的时候，出席招待会的大约五千人全体起立欢迎他们。热情洋溢的群众，其中有穿着鲜艳的红色、银色和金色民族服装的姑娘们，从公园大门口一直排列到装饰得十分美丽的主席台，他们发出震耳欲聋的欢呼声。会场上空飘浮着挂着红纱的彩色气球，红纱上写着“中巴友谊万岁”。

    他在谈到巴中关系时说：“两国签订了重要的边界条约，还有贸易和文化协定，从而为相互合作和谅解展示了新的前景。”
    他说：“巴基斯坦人民深深赞赏中国人民和政府支持查谟和克什米尔人民自决权利的正义立场，这种自决权利是印度和巴基斯坦都已保证要给他们的。”
    他说：“巴基斯坦人民也珍视中国在促进以巩固民族独立和增进自力更生与和平为基础的亚非团结方面所起的作用。”
    他说：当克什米尔爱国者展开他们的自由运动，巴基斯坦遭到印度赤裸裸的侵略的时候，中国履行了它的友好和善邻的道义义务，这是巴基斯坦人民的确永远不能忘怀的。
