    Gansu Promotion of Qinglong Health Clinic Experience On-Site Meeting Debates the Relationship Between Politics and Professional Work
    Emphasizing Politics in Health Work Ensures Adherence to the Correct Direction
    Grasping class struggle, fighting against bourgeois individualism in the mind, and struggling against bourgeois medical thought and medical style, health work can achieve revolutionization, adhere to the socialist road, and serve the people wholeheartedly.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, April 7th, the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee recently held an on-site meeting in Pingliang to summarize and promote the advanced experience of Qinglong Health Clinic of Anguo Commune in Pingliang County in emphasizing politics, creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, constantly transforming thinking, and wholeheartedly serving the people.
    The comrades attending the meeting conscientiously studied Chairman Mao's quotations on politics commanding professional work, serving the people, integrating with workers and peasants, and ideological transformation. Combining learning from Qinglong, finding gaps, and examining thinking, they launched a heated discussion on issues such as emphasizing politics in health work and politics commanding professional work.
    This is a Question of Direction
    The meeting believes that whether or not to emphasize politics is related to whether health work adheres to the socialist direction. The changes before and after the Qinglong Health Clinic vividly illustrate the importance of emphasizing politics. In the early days of the clinic's restoration, due to the fact that politics was not in command and medical personnel put "I" first, a so-called four-no-see—four-fears system was once proposed (no seeing patients who are in debt—fearing losses, no seeing patients who do not pay the consultation fee first—fearing wasted trips, no seeing patients on bad weather nights—fearing hardship, no seeing seriously ill patients—fearing taking responsibility). The masses criticized them: "If you don't see this and you don't see that, it's all about money and laziness." Later, they creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works with these problems, constantly transformed their thinking, and with politics in command, they changed to implement a new consultation system that did not distinguish between day and night, high mountains and long distances, festivals and holidays, or good and bad weather. The two different systems before and after represent two completely different ideologies. The former is a reflection of bourgeois ideology, and the latter is a reflection of proletarian ideology. The comrades attending the meeting believe that the experience and lessons of the Qinglong Health Clinic have universal significance at present. In the health departments, bourgeois medical thoughts and styles still exist quite commonly, which is a concrete reflection of class struggle and the struggle between two roads in health work. Without emphasizing politics, without using Mao Zedong Thought to command, and without vigorously grasping class struggle—fighting against bourgeois individualism in one's own mind, and struggling against bourgeois medical thought and medical style, health work cannot achieve revolutionization, cannot adhere to the socialist road, and cannot serve the people wholeheartedly. Therefore, it is very necessary to launch a major debate on the relationship between politics and professional work among medical and health personnel.
    Criticize Several Erroneous Views
    The comrades attending the meeting opened their minds and conducted in-depth discussions at the meeting, examining and criticizing some erroneous understandings of the issue of politics commanding professional work. One erroneous understanding is: "Politics is soft, professional work is hard, treatment relies on technology, and politics cannot get on the operating table." Everyone believes that politics is spiritual, invisible and intangible, but it is always present and guiding people's actions at all times. Emphasizing proletarian politics is expressed in actions as being hard. Especially at critical moments, it is even more evident whether a person's thinking is strong enough. The first thing that played a role in the Qinglong Health Clinic's successful treatment of burn patients was a strong ideology. In this sense, politics is on the operating table. Everyone pointed out that the experience of the Qinglong Health Clinic also proves that strong ideology is the basis for strong technology. If ideology is strong enough, even if the technology is not high, one will study for the revolution and study for the needs of the masses, and one will learn quickly, learn well, and be able to use what one has learned. Conversely, if one's ideology is not strong enough, the direction is not right, and the motivation is insufficient, the mastery of technology will be limited and will only reach the point of getting by or seeking fame and gain, and one will never strive for perfection.
    Another erroneous view is: "All work is revolutionary work, and good professional work is emphasizing politics." Everyone believes that "all work is revolutionary work" means that any work in our country has its political significance. However, having political significance and emphasizing politics are two different things. People engaged in a certain professional work do not necessarily understand the political significance of their work. There is a question of revolutionary consciousness here. Emphasizing politics and putting politics in command will lead to a high degree of revolutionary consciousness, a full understanding of the political significance of one's work, and a conscious effort to do it well. Conversely, one will not understand the political significance of one's work, and one will not be able to do the work well, or even ruin it. Everyone proved this with personal experiences and countless examples. A person in charge of a rural health grassroots unit said that the medical personnel of the Qinglong Health Clinic recognized the significance of their work, were in the mountains but had the motherland in their hearts and the world in their sights, and made extraordinary achievements in ordinary positions. But he himself was in the countryside but his heart was in the city, so of course he could not do his job well.
    There is also an erroneous view: "Politics is important, and professional work is also important. Professional work takes up a lot of time, so how can we emphasize politics?" Everyone pointed out that politics is the commander, the compass, and the one that controls the direction; professional work refers to actual work. Professional work without political command has no soul; actual work without direction cannot be done well. Any work is carried out under the control of a certain ideology. Politics is playing a controlling role at all times. The more time that professional work takes up, the more important it is to emphasize politics; otherwise, it will be easier to separate from politics. Emphasizing politics is not just shouting political slogans, but using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything and insisting on putting politics in command at all times and in all matters. The Qinglong Health Clinic receives seventy or eighty patients every day, and also has to make rounds and consultations, and delve into technology. The time spent on professional work is very high, but they insist on studying Chairman Mao's works every day, creatively study and apply, learn a little, use a little, transform their thinking, and guide their work. In this way, the professional work is done better and better.
    Three Problems Need to be Solved
    The heads of medical and health departments at all levels attending the meeting repeatedly discussed how to emphasize politics in health work. Everyone agreed that emphasizing politics in health work mainly solves three problems:
    First, use Mao Zedong Thought to transform the subjective world, transform the health team, and promote the ideological revolution of people. At present, the most fundamental thing for medical and health personnel to study Chairman Mao's works is to solve the problem of position, that is, the question of whether to make revolution or not, who to serve, and what road to take. There must be destruction and construction, major destruction and major construction. Destroy bourgeois individualism and establish the idea of ​​not seeking fame or fortune, not fearing hardship or death, and serving the people wholeheartedly; destroy the so-called supra-class viewpoints, establish class and class struggle viewpoints, and look at problems with the method of class analysis; destroy the idea of ​​underestimating the working people, and establish the idea of ​​integrating with the workers and peasants; destroy the idea of ​​fearing difficulties, and establish the idea of ​​resolutely making revolution and making revolution forever. Second, follow Chairman Mao's teachings, go deep into the workers and peasants, combine with the workers and peasants, and transform ourselves in the struggle of the three major revolutionary movements. Rural grassroots medical units must listen to the opinions of the masses with an open mind, learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and constantly transform their thinking. Medical units above the county level organize mobile medical teams to go to the countryside, not only to treat the masses, but also to cure their own "ideological" diseases. It is best to combine mobile medical treatment with participation in the socialist education movement, and combine treating the masses with transforming ourselves. Third, establish and strengthen the regular political work of the health department, adhere to the four firsts, and do a good job in lively ideological work.
    Second, use Mao Zedong Thought to transform the objective world, transform health work, and promote the revolutionization of work. Everyone believes that to realize the revolutionization of health work is to use Mao Zedong Thought to command health work, ensure that health work adheres to the correct direction, and take the socialist road. At present, health work must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instruction on shifting the focus of health work to the countryside. When discussing the specific steps to realize the revolutionization of health work, everyone believed that it is first necessary to thoroughly understand both ends. Second, we must thoroughly reform the medical system, improve the medical style, and revolutionize it. Eliminate the old frameworks and foreign dogmas that are divorced from the masses, divorced from production, and divorced from reality, and establish a revolutionary system and style that faces the countryside, faces production, and facilitates the masses, so that the broad masses can see a doctor, afford a doctor, and see a doctor well.
    Third, use Mao Zedong Thought to promote the revolutionization of leadership thinking. This is the key to the revolutionization of the entire health work. Leading cadres of health leading departments and medical units above the county level must emphasize politics, put the study of Chairman Mao's works in the first place, take the lead in studying, take the lead in applying, and transform their thinking and transform their work.
    Shi Shuhan, Vice Minister of Health, spoke at the on-site meeting. On behalf of the Ministry of Health, he awarded the certificate of "Revolutionary Model of Rural Health Clinic" to the Qinglong Health Clinic, and awarded each medical staff of the Qinglong Health Clinic a set of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong".
    During the meeting, Chen Zenggu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee, spoke on the issue of emphasizing politics in health work. Fu Weiyi, Director of the Gansu Provincial Health Department, made a summary of the experience of the Qinglong Health Clinic, and Yang Peiqing, head of the Qinglong Health Clinic, made a report on the work situation. The comrades attending the meeting also visited the Qinglong Health Clinic and their exhibition of advanced deeds. (Photo attached)

    甘肃推广青龙卫生所经验现场会辩论政治与业务的关系
    卫生工作突出政治才能坚持正确方向
    抓阶级斗争，同头脑里的资产阶级个人主义斗争，同资产阶级的医疗思想、医疗作风斗争，卫生工作才能实现革命化，坚持社会主义道路，全心全意为人民服务。
    据新华社兰州七日电　中共甘肃省委最近在平凉召开现场会议，总结和推广平凉县安国公社青龙卫生所突出政治、活学活用毛主席著作，不断改造思想、全心全意为人民服务的先进经验。
    参加这次会议的同志认真学习了毛主席关于政治统帅业务、为人民服务、同工农群众相结合、思想改造等方面的语录，结合学青龙、找差距、查思想，就卫生工作突出政治、政治统帅业务等问题，展开了一次热烈的讨论。
    这是一个方向问题
    会议认为，突出不突出政治，是关系到卫生工作是否坚持社会主义方向的问题。青龙卫生所的前后变化生动地说明了突出政治的重要性。这个卫生所恢复初期，由于政治不挂帅，医务人员“我”字当头，曾经提出一个所谓四不看—四怕的制度（欠账不看—怕亏本，不先交出诊费不看—怕白跑路，坏天夜间不看—怕苦，重危病人不看—怕承担责任）。群众批评他们：“这不看，那不看，一是为钱，二是懒汉”。以后，他们带着这些问题活学活用毛主席著作，不断改造思想，政治挂了帅，改而实行了不分昼夜、不分山高路远、不分节日假日、不分好坏天气等新的应诊制度。前后两种不同制度代表了两种截然不同的思想。前者是资产阶级思想的反映，后者是无产阶级思想的反映。参加会议的同志认为，青龙卫生所的经验和教训目前具有普遍意义。在卫生部门中，目前还相当普遍地存在着资产阶级的医疗思想和作风，这是阶级斗争和两条道路斗争在卫生工作中的具体反映。不突出政治，不用毛泽东思想挂帅，狠抓阶级斗争——同自己头脑里的资产阶级个人主义斗，同资产阶级的医疗思想、医疗作风斗，卫生工作就不能实现革命化，就不能坚持社会主义道路，全心全意为人民服务。因此，在医疗卫生人员中展开一次政治与业务关系的大辩论，是十分必要的。
    批判几种错误看法
    参加会议的同志，在会上敞开思想，深入讨论，检查和批判了对政治统帅业务问题的一些错误认识。一种错误认识是：“政治软，业务硬，治病靠技术，政治上不了手术台。”大家认为：政治是精神的东西，看不见，摸不着，但无时不在，无事不在，每时每刻都指导人们的行动。突出了无产阶级的政治，表现在行动上就是硬的。特别是关键时刻，更能看出人的思想过硬不过硬。青龙卫生所治好烧伤病人，起作用的首先是过硬的思想。从这个意义来讲，政治是上了手术台的。大家指出，青龙卫生所的经验还证明，思想过硬是技术过硬的基础。思想过得硬，技术不高，也会为革命而学，为群众需要而学，并且学得快，学得好，学了就能用。反之，思想不过硬，方向不对，动力不足，掌握技术就有限度，只能达到过得去或者图得名利为止，决不会精益求精。
    另一种错误看法是：“一切工作都是革命工作，业务好就是突出政治。”大家认为，“一切工作都是革命工作”，是指在我们国家里任何工作都有其政治意义而言。但是，有政治意义与突出政治是两码事。从事某项业务工作的人，不一定都懂得他所做的工作的政治意义。这里有一个革命觉悟问题。突出政治，政治挂帅，就会有高度的革命觉悟，充分认识其工作的政治意义，自觉地把它做好。反之，就不理解其工作的政治意义，也就不能把工作做好，甚至还会搞坏。大家以切身体会和无数事例证明了这一点。有位搞农村卫生基层单位的负责人说，青龙卫生所的医务人员认识到工作的意义，身在山区，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，在平凡的岗位上作出了不平凡的成绩。而自己身在农村，心在城里，工作当然就做不好。
    还有一种错误看法是：“政治重要，业务也重要。业务占的时间多，怎么突出政治？”大家指出，政治是统帅，是指针，是管方向的；业务指的实际工作。业务没有政治统帅，就没有灵魂；实际工作没有方向，就不能做好。做任何一项工作，都是在一定思想支配下进行的。政治时时刻刻都在起着支配作用。越是业务占用时间多，越是要突出政治；否则，就越容易脱离政治。突出政治，并不是空喊政治口号，而是用毛泽东思想统帅一切，时时事事处处坚持政治挂帅。青龙卫生所每天接待七八十个病人，还要巡回出诊，钻研技术，业务工作占的时间很多，但是，他们坚持天天学习毛主席著作，活学活用，学一点，用一点，改造思想，指导工作。这样，业务工作也就越做越好。
    需要解决三个问题
    参加会议的各级医疗卫生部门负责人，反复讨论了卫生工作如何突出政治的问题。大家一致认为，卫生工作突出政治，主要解决三个问题：
    第一、用毛泽东思想改造主观世界，改造卫生队伍，促进人的思想革命化。当前，医疗卫生人员学习毛主席著作，最根本的是解决立场问题，也就是革命不革命、为谁服务、走什么道路的问题。要有破有立，大破大立。破资产阶级个人主义，树立不为名、不为利，不怕苦、不怕死，全心全意为人民服务的思想；破所谓超阶级的观点，树立阶级和阶级斗争观点，用阶级分析的方法看待问题；破轻视劳动人民的思想，树立同工农群众相结合的思想；破害怕困难的思想，树立坚决革命，永远革命的思想。其次，遵照毛主席的教导，深入工农群众，同工农相结合，在三大革命运动的斗争中改造自己。农村基层医疗单位，要虚心听取群众意见，向贫农、下中农学习，不断改造思想。县以上的医疗单位组织巡回医疗队下乡，不单给群众治病，也要给自己治“思想”病。最好把巡回医疗与参加社会主义教育运动结合起来，把为群众治病同改造自己结合起来。再次，建立和加强卫生部门经常性的政治工作，坚持四个第一，做好活的思想工作。
    第二、用毛泽东思想改造客观世界，改造卫生工作，促进工作革命化。大家认为，实现卫生工作革命化，就是用毛泽东思想统帅卫生工作，保证卫生工作坚持正确的方向，走社会主义道路。当前，卫生工作必须坚决贯彻执行毛主席关于把卫生工作重点转到农村的指示。在讨论实现卫生工作革命化的具体步骤时，大家认为，首先必须吃透两头。其次，必须彻底改革医疗制度，改进医疗作风，使其革命化。破除脱离群众、脱离生产、脱离实际的旧框框、洋教条，建立面向农村、面向生产、便利群众的革命化的制度和作风，使广大群众看得上病，看得起病，看得好病。
    第三、用毛泽东思想促进领导思想革命化。这是整个卫生工作革命化的关键。县级以上卫生领导部门和医疗单位的领导干部，必须突出政治，把学习毛主席著作放在第一位，带头学，带头用，改造思想改造工作。
    卫生部副部长史书翰在现场会上讲了话。他代表卫生部把“农村卫生所革命化的榜样”的奖状授给青龙卫生所，并奖给青龙卫生所医务人员每人一套《毛泽东选集》。
    会议期间，中共甘肃省委书记处书记陈曾固就卫生工作突出政治的问题讲了话。甘肃省卫生厅厅长傅唯一作了关于青龙卫生所的经验总结，青龙卫生所负责人杨培清作了关于工作情况的汇报。参加会议的同志还参观了青龙卫生所和他们的先进事迹展览。（附图片）
