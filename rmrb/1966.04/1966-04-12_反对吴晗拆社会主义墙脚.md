    Opposing Wu Han's Demolition of the Socialist Foundation
    Worker of Suzhou Automobile Transportation Department　Li Genyuan
    I am a young worker. I believe that Comrade Wu Han's works reflect his bourgeois restoration fantasies and his anti-Party, anti-people ideological essence. I feel deeply resentful: the so-called "experts and scholars" actually use their research results to oppose socialism!
    Under the leadership of our respected leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, workers in all walks of life are launching a vigorous great production campaign, hoping to add more bricks and tiles to the country, highlighting politics, working hard, and serving the people wholeheartedly. A few years ago, when we encountered temporary difficulties, Comrade Wu Han was demolishing the foundation of socialism. He completely stood on the position of the hostile class to oppose us. I can't help but ask Comrade Wu Han, have you ever participated in labor? Are you worthy of our Party, worthy of our working class? Our workers and peasants have created material wealth and spiritual wealth, giving you status and enjoyment, but you wrote "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" to oppose our workers, peasants, and our socialist cause! You thought we couldn't see through your cunning allegorical techniques, but the eyes of the masses are sharp, and any reactionary words and deeds will not ultimately deceive the eyes of the workers and peasants.
    Comrade Wu Han's "masterpiece" can only be appreciated by a small handful of right-leaning opportunists, but we workers resolutely oppose it! The people need operas that praise Chairman Mao's brilliant thought, and love operas that write about heroes like Jiao Yulu, Lei Feng, and Wang Jie; we oppose operas that have even a hint of negativity towards the Party. The poisonous weed of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" must be uprooted completely.

    反对吴晗拆社会主义墙脚
    苏州市汽车运输处工人　李根源
    我是一个青年工人。我认为，吴晗同志的作品反映了他的资产阶级的复辟幻想和反党反人民的思想实质。我深深感到痛恨：所谓“专家学者”，原来竟是用他的研究成果来反社会主义的人！
    我们工人在敬爱的领袖毛主席和党中央的领导下，各行各业正在展开轰轰烈烈的大生产，希望多为国家添一砖一瓦，突出政治，努力劳动，全心全意为人民服务。前几年，吴晗同志却在我们遇到暂时困难的时候，拆社会主义的墙脚。他完全是站到敌对阶级立场上反对我们。我不禁要问吴晗同志，你参加过劳动吗？你对得起我们党、对得起我们工人阶级吗？我们工人、农民创造了物质财富，也创造了精神财富，给了你地位和享受，你却写《海瑞罢官》来反对我们工人、农民，反对我们的社会主义事业！你以为用了狡猾的影射手法，我们就看不出来了，其实群众的眼睛是雪亮的，任何反动言行最终都迷不住工人、农民的眼睛。
    吴晗同志的“杰作”只能为一小撮右倾机会主义分子所赞赏，我们工人则坚决反对！人民需要歌颂毛主席光辉思想的戏，喜爱写焦裕禄、雷锋、王杰式英雄的戏；我们反对那怕只有一丝丝对党不利的戏。《海瑞罢官》这株毒草必须连根拔掉。
