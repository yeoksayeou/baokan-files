People's Friendship Lasts Forever

A Pakistani friend named Akbar said, when talking about Chairman Liu Shaoqi's visit to West Pakistan, "Our Pakistani people are not just welcoming Chairman Liu with flowers and flags, but with our hearts."

On March 26th, when Chairman Liu and his party arrived in Rawalpindi, as the motorcade of Chinese guests drove from the airport to the city center, the driver of a locomotive traveling on the railway saw the motorcade approaching and immediately stopped the locomotive. Dozens of railway workers scrambled to the top of the train and waved vigorously, shouting: "Long live Sino-Pakistani friendship!"

In Lahore, more than 8,000 motorized tricycle and taxi workers decorated their vehicles beautifully and, shortly before the arrival of the Chinese guests, drove to the streets to hold a grand parade praising Sino-Pakistani friendship. Then, they gave free rides to passengers who wanted to participate in the welcoming ceremony, and drove in a mighty procession towards the airport.

Lahore is now in full bloom, and people are busy going to nurseries and flower shops to buy all kinds of flowers to bring to the welcoming lines. Some people had placed orders for flowers at flower shops a week in advance. To meet everyone's needs, some gardeners simply opened their garden gates and distributed flowers to the welcoming masses for free. They believed that offering the flowers they had grown with hard work to the Chinese Chairman was the greatest reward for them.

On the streets of Rawalpindi, torrential rain soaked the clothes of hundreds of thousands of welcomers and washed away countless colorful paper slogans and flags on both sides of the road. But people immediately replaced them with new ones and continued to wait for the Chinese guests with great excitement. When the sky cleared, elementary school students jumped and waved the bouquets, ribbons, and placards in their hands. Someone asked a ten-year-old girl if she felt uncomfortable being soaked in the rain. The reply was: "What? I would be willing to stand in the rain for twenty-four hours to welcome the Chinese Chairman."

An elderly woman with white hair stood by the roadside with her little grandson, repeatedly shouting: "Zindabad! Zindabad! (Long live! Long live!)" Every time she shouted, the people around her responded with a hundred times the enthusiasm.

In Lahore, from the moment Chairman Liu's special plane appeared in the clouds, the emotions of a million people soared uncontrollably. As soon as the plane landed, people rushed towards the plane and every car in the motorcade like a tide. The motorcade simply couldn't move forward. People reached into the cars, one hand, two hands, three hands, wanting to shake the hand of every Chinese person in the car before they would let go. While shaking hands, they waved the placards in their hands, which read "The Chinese people are the true friends of the Pakistani people!" vigorously towards the Chinese guests with tears of excitement in their eyes.

This friendship between the Pakistani people and the Chinese people has developed in the struggle against imperialism and expansionism. It has stood the test. During this visit, many Pakistani friends emphasized this point.

As the motorcade of Chinese guests drove on the street, enthusiastic welcomers often sent portraits of Chairman Liu that they had drawn, as well as petals, confetti, small flags, and handkerchiefs, into the cars of the Chinese guests. Among them was a printed leaflet with a short poem entitled "Enemies and Friends":

　　“Who supports us in times of emergency?
　　Who betrays us in days of trial?
　　Who is a friend, who is an enemy?
　　Now it is no longer difficult to distinguish.
　　Love your friends, kick your enemies.
　　Welcome China, tell the American guys to get out!”

Once, a cyclist chased after the motorcade of Chinese guests with all his might, holding the handlebars with one hand and waving with the other, shouting loudly in Urdu, and then in English: "Forgive me for not being able to speak Chinese, but I want to say! I want to say! You are our friends, no, brothers, no, our dearest people! We oppose American imperialism! Down with American imperialism!" On the front of his bicycle was a cluster of bright red flowers, with a few yellow flowers mixed in, which seemed to be a symbol of China's five-star red flag. A Pakistani friend, Karim, told Chinese reporters: "Imperialism and its running dogs always want to isolate China and help India fight Pakistan. Let them come to Lahore today and take a look! See how a hundred million Pakistani people use their actions to show: they will always stand with the Chinese people!"

In the struggle against Indian aggression, the heroism displayed by the Pakistani people left a deep impression on the Chinese guests visiting Pakistan.

At the banquet of the Governor of West Pakistan Province, a Lahore party leader talked to the Chinese guests about how the local people calmly resisted the enemy when India attacked Lahore last year. He said: "Everyone is a warrior. Without weapons, we picked up sticks. Women automatically cooked meals and sent them to the soldiers on the front lines. The enemy outnumbered us by far. They also had weapons supplied by world powers. They used all the weapons they had. But we repelled them. I completely agree with Chairman Mao Zedong's words: 'The decisive factor is people'." The heroic struggle of the Pakistani people won victory. Now, the Shalimar Gardens in Lahore, which was once directly threatened by the invaders, has regained its dazzling appearance. The Badshahi Mosque, the largest in the world, is as new and beautiful as it was when it was first built three hundred years ago.

However, as the chairman of the Pakistan-China Friendship Association said in her welcome speech, the war is over, but the struggle against imperialism and colonialism is not over. The Pakistani people, who are building their own country, are vigilantly watching the conspiracies of imperialists and expansionists.

At the construction site of the new capital Islamabad, more high-rise buildings are being built. Pakistani hosts and Chinese guests stood shoulder to shoulder on a hill overlooking this busy construction site. Beside them, the saplings planted by Chairman Liu and Premier Zhou Enlai two years ago had particularly green leaves in the sunlight. At this time, we couldn't help but think: no force can block the path of the Pakistani people's advancement, and no force can destroy the everlasting friendship between the Chinese and Pakistani people.

### 人民的友谊万古长青

    人民的友谊万古长青
    一位名叫阿克巴尔的巴基斯坦朋友在谈到刘少奇主席这次在西巴基斯坦访问的时候说：“我们巴基斯坦人民不光是用鲜花和旗帜来欢迎刘主席，而是掏出心来欢迎他。”
    刘主席一行在三月二十六日到达拉瓦尔品第，当中国客人的车队从机场开往市中心的时候，铁路上正在行驶的一辆机车的司机，一看到车队走近铁路，马上把机车停下来，好几十名铁路工人争先恐后地爬到车顶上，使劲地挥手高呼：“中巴友好万岁！”
    在拉合尔，八千多名机动三轮车和出租汽车工人，把他们的车子打扮得漂漂亮亮的，在中国客人到达以前不久，开到街上举行了一次歌颂巴中友好的大游行。然后，他们免费载上要参加欢迎仪式的乘客，浩浩荡荡地开向飞机场。
    拉合尔现在已经是百花盛开的时节，人们忙着到花圃和花店里购买各种鲜花，带到欢迎的行列中去。有些人在一个星期以前就向花店定购了鲜花。为了满足大家的需要，一些花匠干脆打开他们的园门，免费把鲜花分发给欢迎的群众。他们认为，把他们用辛勤劳动种出来的鲜花献给中国的主席，那就是对他们的最大的报酬。
    拉瓦尔品第的街头，倾盆大雨湿透了几十万欢迎人群的衣裳，冲掉了马路两边无数彩纸制成的标语和旗帜。但是人们马上又把新的换了上来，仍旧兴高采烈地等待中国客人。天晴了，小学生们蹦蹦跳跳地挥舞着手中的花束、彩带、标语牌。有人问一个十岁的小姑娘，身上淋湿了难受吧？回答是：“什么？为了欢迎中国的主席我在雨里站二十四小时也愿意。”
    一位白发苍苍的老太太带着她的小孙孙站在路旁，一再高呼：“金达巴！金达巴！（万岁！万岁！）”她每喊一句，周围的人用百倍的热情来响应她。
    在拉合尔，从刘主席乘坐的专机出现在云端的时候起，一百万群众的情绪就高涨得按奈不住。飞机刚一着陆，人们象潮水一般拥向专机旁边，拥向车队的每一辆汽车。车队实在没办法前进了。人们把手伸进汽车，一只、两只、三只，要把汽车里每一个中国人的手都握遍了才肯罢休。他们一面握手，一面含着激动的眼泪把手中写着“中国人民是巴基斯坦人民真正的朋友！”的标语牌使劲地向中国客人晃动。
    巴基斯坦人民和中国人民之间的这种友情，是在反对帝国主义和扩张主义斗争中发展起来的。它是经受了考验的。在这次访问中，许多巴基斯坦朋友着重指出了这一点。
    当中国客人的车队走在街上的时候，热情的欢迎者常常把自己画的刘主席画象以及花瓣、花纸、小旗、手帕等，送进中国客人的汽车里，其中有一张铅印的传单印有这样一首题为《敌和友》的短诗：
    “谁在紧急的时刻支持我们？
    谁在考验的日子背叛我们？
    谁是朋友，谁是敌人？
    现在再也不难辨认。
    爱你的朋友，踢你的敌人。
    欢迎中国，要美国佬滚！”
    有一次，一个骑自行车的人，使劲追赶着中国客人的车队，一手扶把，一手挥舞着，用乌尔都文，然后用英文高声呼喊：“原谅我不会说中国话，但是我要说！我要说！你们是我们的朋友，不，兄弟，不，我们最亲爱的人！我们反对美帝国主义！打倒美帝国主义！”在他的车头上是一丛鲜红色的花，当中杂有几朵黄花，看来这是中国的五星红旗的象征。一个巴基斯坦朋友卡利姆对中国记者说：“帝国主义和它的走狗总是想孤立中国，帮助印度打巴基斯坦。让他们今天来拉合尔看一看吧！看看一亿巴基斯坦人民怎样用他们的行动表示：他们永远同中国人民站在一起！”
    在反对印度侵略的斗争中，巴基斯坦人民表现的英雄气概，给这次访问巴基斯坦的中国客人留下了深刻的印象。
    在西巴基斯坦省督的宴会上，一个拉合尔的政党负责人向中国客人畅谈去年印度进攻拉合尔的时候，当地人民怎样沉着地抵抗敌人。他说：“每一个人都是战士。没有武器，我们拿起棍棒。妇女们自动做饭送给前线的士兵。敌人在人数上比我们多得多。他们还有世界大国供给的武器。他们把他们所得到的武器都用上了。但是，我们打退了他们。我完全同意毛泽东主席说的话：‘决定的因素是人’。”巴基斯坦人民的英勇斗争赢得了胜利。现在，曾经受到侵略者直接威胁的拉合尔夏利马尔公园，又恢复了它那光彩夺目的面貌。那世界上最大的巴德沙希清真寺，还象它三百年前刚建成的时候那样崭新美丽。
    但是，正象巴中友好协会主席在她的欢迎词中所说的一样，战争结束了，但是反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争没有结束。正在建设自己祖国的巴基斯坦人民，警惕地注意着帝国主义和扩张主义者的阴谋。
    在新首都伊斯兰堡的工地上，更多的高楼大厦正在修建起来。巴基斯坦主人和中国客人肩并肩地站在一个山岗上俯视着这片忙碌的工地，在他们旁边，刘主席刚刚种下的和周恩来总理两年前种下的树苗，叶子在阳光下显得特别翠绿。这时候，我们不禁想到：没有任何力量能够堵住巴基斯坦人民前进的道路，也没有任何力量能够破坏中巴两国人民之间万古长青的友谊。
