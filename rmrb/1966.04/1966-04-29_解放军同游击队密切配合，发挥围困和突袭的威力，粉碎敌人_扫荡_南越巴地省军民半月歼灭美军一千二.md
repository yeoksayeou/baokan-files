    (Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi) According to supplementary reports from the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the army and people of Ba Ria Province in South Vietnam fought continuously for fifteen days, crushing a large-scale "mopping-up" operation launched by the U.S. invading forces against Ba Ria Province. Preliminary statistics show that 1,200 U.S. invading troops were annihilated (excluding puppet troops and accomplice troops), with one U.S. First Infantry Division battalion completely wiped out, and another battalion suffering heavy casualties. The Liberation Armed Forces also shot down, destroyed, and damaged a large number of enemy helicopters, and seized a large number of weapons and military supplies.
    The report said that from March 30 to April 14, the U.S. aggressors dispatched two brigades from the U.S. First Infantry Division, the 173rd Airborne Brigade, and the Seventh Fleet, as well as accomplice troops from Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, and puppet troops, totaling 15,000 men. Under the cover of various types of aircraft, including B-52 strategic bombers, and a large number of armored vehicles and artillery, they launched a major "mopping-up" operation in the suburbs of Ba Ria Province, Long Dien, Dat Do, and Xuyen Moc counties.
    In areas such as Tan Lo, Gia Ray, and Xuan Son, the guerrillas intercepted the enemy for three consecutive days, killing and wounding 69 U.S. invaders and 3 puppet troops.
    On April 10 and 11, just as the American bandits were being besieged and heavily attacked by guerrillas everywhere, the Ba Ria Provincial Liberation Army suddenly appeared in the Den Do and Lam Xuan areas, dealing a heavy blow to the U.S. invading forces, annihilating one battalion of the U.S. First Infantry Division, and severely damaging another battalion, killing a total of 800 U.S. invading troops, and seizing a large number of machine guns and military supplies. After suffering heavy casualties, the enemy hurriedly retreated on April 14.
    (Xinhua News Agency, April 27) Saigon dispatch: The South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces launched four consecutive attacks on U.S. invaders and South Korean accomplice troops in Saigon City, the nest of the U.S.-puppet clique, on the 26th.
    According to the Associated Press, in the northern suburbs of Saigon, the People's Armed Forces "threw a grenade into a jeep carrying four U.S. soldiers," and all the invaders in the vehicle were injured. Shortly after noon, the People's Armed Forces once again "threw a grenade at a U.S. jeep." The report said that at three or four o'clock in the afternoon, "someone threw a grenade into the courtyard of the U.S. communications unit near Tan Son Nhut Airport," injuring another U.S. invader.

    据新华社河内电　据越南南方解放通讯社补充报道，越南南方巴地省军民连续奋战十五天，粉碎了美国侵略军对巴地省发动的一次大规模“扫荡”。据初步统计，歼灭美国侵略军（不包括伪军和帮凶军）一千二百名，全歼美国第一步兵师一个营，另一个营遭到惨重伤亡。解放武装力量还击落、击毁、击伤敌军的大批直升飞机，并且缴获大批武器和军用物资。
    报道说，从三月三十日到四月十四日，美国侵略者出动了美军第一步兵师的两个旅、第一七三空降旅和第七舰队，以及澳大利亚、新西兰、南朝鲜等帮凶军和伪军共一万五千人，在包括B—52型战略轰炸机在内的各种类型飞机和大批装甲车、大炮的掩护下，对巴地省城郊、龙田、红土和川木等县展开了一次大“扫荡”。
    在新露、雅栋、春山等地区，游击队一连三天截击敌人，打死打伤美国侵略者六十九名、伪军三名。
    四月十日和十一日，正当美国强盗在各地遭到游击队的围困和沉重打击的时候，巴地省解放军突然出现在登波和林春地区，给美国侵略军以狠狠打击，歼灭美国第一步兵师一个营，重创另一个营，共打死美国侵略军八百名，缴获大批机枪和军用物资。敌人在遭到惨重伤亡之后，已于四月十四日慌忙撤逃。
    据新华社二十七日讯　西贡消息：越南南方人民武装力量二十六日在美伪集团的巢穴西贡市接连四次袭击美国侵略者和南朝鲜帮凶军。
    据美联社报道，在西贡北郊，人民武装力量“把一颗手榴弹投入载有四名美军的吉普车”，车中的侵略军全部被炸伤。在午后不久，人民武装力量再一次“向一辆美国吉普车扔了手榴弹”。报道说，在下午三、四点钟，“有人把一颗手榴弹扔进新山一机场附近美国通讯部队的院子里”，又炸伤一名美国侵略军。
