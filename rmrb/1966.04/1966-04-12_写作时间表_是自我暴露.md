    "Writing Timetable" is Self-Exposure
    Worker of Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant Wang Zhenhuai
    Since liberation, Comrade Wu Han has diligently written many articles. Among these articles, quite a few are about Hai Rui, which are a concentrated manifestation of Comrade Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-socialist political ideology. "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" are two specimens. In December 1965, after being criticized, Comrade Wu Han wrote a "self-criticism." In this "self-criticism," he arranged a writing timetable, attempting to deceive the broad masses of readers from exposing his political errors, but the timetable precisely exposed his criminal anti-Party and anti-socialist activities.
    "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" was written before the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. At that time, internationally, imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries staged an anti-China chorus. Domestically, monsters and demons came out of their lairs one after another. Right opportunist elements also seized the opportunity to launch attacks on the Party and socialism. They said that the people's communes were established too early and the Great Leap Forward was a mess. Just at this time, Comrade Wu Han, who had always opposed "smearing the faces of ancestors," wrote the article "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor," severely scolding the emperor he revered. He wrote about Hai Rui scolding the emperor, but in reality, it was not Hai Rui scolding the emperor, but Comrade Wu Han representing a small handful of right opportunist elements scolding the Party and socialism. Not only that, Comrade Wu Han repeatedly said that writing history must conform to historical facts. However, the Hai Rui in history never scolded the emperor at all. Why did Comrade Wu Han distort history like this? The reason is that he stood on the position of right opportunism and wanted to use Hai Rui's mouth to scold the Party and socialism. Thus, he disregarded historical facts and fabricated Hai Rui's scolding of the emperor.
    Comrade Wu Han's timetable also tells us that "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was written after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. At that time, right opportunist elements suffered a complete defeat, and some were even "dismissed" from "office." Therefore, Comrade Wu Han wrote the play "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," portraying Hai Rui as a great savior of the people, expressing his grievances for Hai Rui's dismissal. This play, as many comrades have pointed out, is actually encouraging right opportunist elements to continue to oppose the Party and socialism.
    Comrade Wu Han's refusal to admit his political errors in his "self-criticism" is precisely to adhere to his own reactionary stance. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we workers must fight to the end against this reactionary thought that supports right opportunism and completely crush them.

    “写作时间表”是自我暴露
    长辛店机车车辆厂工人　王振淮
    解放以来，吴晗同志非常卖力地写了不少文章。这些文章中有好些是写海瑞的，这是吴晗同志反党反社会主义政治思想的集中表现。《海瑞骂皇帝》和《海瑞罢官》就是两个标本。一九六五年十二月，吴晗同志在受到批评后写了一篇“自我批评”。他在这篇“自我批评”中排了一张写作时间表，企图以此蒙蔽广大读者对他的政治错误的揭发，但是时间表恰恰暴露了他的反党反社会主义的罪恶活动。
    《海瑞骂皇帝》是写在党的八届八中全会以前的。当时在国际上，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派演出了反华大合唱。在国内，牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼。右倾机会主义分子也乘机向党向社会主义发动进攻。他们说什么人民公社搞早了，大跃进搞糟了。正当这时候，一向反对“替祖宗脸上抹黑”的吴晗同志，却写出了《海瑞骂皇帝》的文章，大骂起他敬爱的皇帝来了。他写海瑞骂皇帝，实际上不是写海瑞在骂皇帝，而是写吴晗同志代表一小撮右倾机会主义分子在骂党骂社会主义。不只是这样，吴晗同志口口声声地说，写历史要符合历史事实。但是，历史上的海瑞是根本没有骂过皇帝的。为什么吴晗同志要这样歪曲历史呢？原因就是他站在右倾机会主义的立场上，要借海瑞的口来骂党骂社会主义。这样，他就不顾历史事实，捏造海瑞的骂皇帝了。
    吴晗同志的时间表还告诉我们，《海瑞罢官》是写在党的八届八中全会以后的。当时，右倾机会主义分子遭到了彻底的失败，有的还被“罢”了“官”。因此，吴晗同志又写出《海瑞罢官》这出戏，把海瑞描写成一个人民的大救星，对海瑞的被罢官抱不平。这出戏，正象很多同志所指出的，实际上是在鼓励右倾机会主义分子继续反党反社会主义。
    吴晗同志在“自我批评”中死不承认他自己的政治错误，就是坚持他自己的反动立场。我们工人在党和毛主席的领导下，一定要和这种支持右倾机会主义的反动思想斗争到底，一直把它们彻底粉碎为止。
