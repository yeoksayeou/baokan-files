    Living Philosophy of Disaster Resistance
    Changes in Highlighting Politics in an Old Disaster Area – Fuyang Prefecture

    Disaster areas, especially old and severely affected areas, experience frequent natural disasters and a vast "realm of necessity" that hasn't been understood. Can these regions quickly change their difficult circumstances?

    The changes in Fuyang Prefecture, Anhui Province, show the immense power generated when people’s thoughts are focused on Mao Zedong Thought and a philosophy of struggle replaces pessimistic viewpoints!

    Fuyang Prefecture is an old disaster area with a population of seven million. This area experiences flooding in nine out of ten years. From the beginning of Liberation until the first half of 1964, the state supplied 4.3 billion *jin* of grain to the rural masses throughout the prefecture. Since the second half of 1964, despite continuing disasters, there have been relatively good harvests every season. In 1965, rainfall was roughly equivalent to 1963, but the affected area decreased from 14 million *mu* to 5 million *mu*. Grain production that year reached the highest level in history, with more than 1 billion *jin* of grain sold to the state; the number of pigs raised exceeded the highest level in history, with 600,000 fat pigs sold to the state; large livestock increased by 13 percent compared to 1964; and purchasing power increased by about 20 percent compared to the bumper harvest year of 1957. This significant change came sooner than people expected.

    What is the fundamental reason for this change? Is it support from external forces? No. We sought the opinions of many cadres and commune members, and the common view is: the great role of the Socialist Education Movement, the fact that class struggle has become the driving force for overcoming disasters, the fact that poor and lower-middle peasants have formed a revolutionary force, consolidated and strengthened the collective economy, and used dialectical thinking as a weapon to initially grasp the regularity of disaster resistance and production, thus gaining the freedom of struggle.

    "Letting Go Leads to Initiative"

    The disaster of the Huai River floods has been basically controlled since 1954. However, waterlogging in the Huaibei area remains a serious disaster.

    How to fight waterlogging?

    Water flows downhill. Acknowledge it, and you have freedom in water management; deny it, and you won't have freedom.

    However, whether or not this regularity of things can be recognized involves the issue of class struggle. The class limitations, old habits, and old viewpoints brought about by the old society won't be overthrown without a fight. Here, the idea of blocking water is the old thing. Historically, in the Fuyang area, landlords and capitalists each controlled their own territory, deceiving and coercing the masses, building dams everywhere to block water, setting up defenses wherever water entered. As a result, large numbers of earth dams were built to block water at the boundaries between provinces and counties, and between different spheres of influence. Consequently, floods were forced to flow sideways, first inundating the upstream areas, and then, when that was no longer possible, inundating the downstream areas. Therefore, downstream damming and upstream leveling of dams became a long-standing contradiction and dispute in this region. After Liberation, this feudal separatist thinking manifested itself as a habit, the idea being that blocking water protects the interests of the masses. In reality, this wasn't about conquering water disasters, but a pessimistic viewpoint of each protecting its own territory, a kind of separatism, not Marxism.

    Water cannot be blocked. Blocking water, thinking of leaving the water damage to others, in the end the water still returns to your side, and you suffer just the same.

    To overcome water damage, you must acknowledge: first, water must flow. Second, water flows downhill. Third, upstream and downstream working together to deal with water, water can be conquered. Acknowledging these three points came after serious ideological struggle. In the struggle, a global perspective of unity in water management was established, with the downstream voluntarily letting water pass for the upstream. In the spring of 1964, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee resolutely implemented the instructions of the Party Central Committee, leading the broad masses in the Huaibei area to begin leveling dams blocking water. Fuyang Prefecture, bordering Henan Province, including the six counties of Linquan, Jieshou, Boxian, Guoyang, Taihe, and Funan, leveled 120 sites. Between counties within the prefecture, 159 sites were leveled. According to the flow of water, no matter how much water came from the upstream, they let it pass; wherever leveling was required, the upstream made requests, and the downstream leveled, and after leveling, invited the upstream to inspect and accept. Many Communist Party members in the Fuyang area, in this leveling of dams, realized that they were not Communist Party members of one particular region, but Communist Party members of China, who must represent not only the interests of the downstream people, but also the interests of the upstream people, and even more so the interests of the people of the whole country. Poor and lower-middle peasants said that only under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao can the farmers of the world be one family. In the old society, we were forced to fight for the interests of the landlords, and those who died and were injured were all our own relatives, not a single landlord.

    Problems left over from thousands of years of history were thus resolved. The long-formed habits of feudal separatism were also broken.

    Xinxing District of Guoyang County, which we visited, borders Yongcheng County in Henan and is a famous old disaster area. In 1963, earth dams could not stop upstream floods, and there were 37 breaches in the district, with 63 villages completely surrounded by water. The District Party Secretary, seeing that blocking water wasn't working, waded through waist-deep water to observe the water situation. They investigated the water flow within the district and also went to the upstream of Henan to find out about the incoming water. From wading through the water, they understood that letting the water flow down was better than blocking it, and resolved to accept the incoming water from the upstream. The District Party Committee led the masses to level all water-blocking projects in the district, and at the same time, according to the water flow, dug through some unconnected ditches within the district. In 1965, another major flood occurred, but the water drained faster, the disaster was greatly reduced, and a relatively good harvest was still obtained.

    This matter seems to solve the problem of water conservancy, but it is actually a very big political problem. In our socialist society, the whole country is a chessboard, and the part should serve the whole. Unity is the only way to form a fist to defeat the enemy. In Huaibei water management, one sentence with great significance encouraged people to move forward, and that is "Letting Go Leads to Initiative." The downstream letting water pass means sacrificing certain local interests in exchange for overall interests. Only by letting the water flow down can we manage the water. "Letting Go Leads to Initiative" embodies the new socialist relationship between upstream and downstream. This revolutionary saying has universal guiding significance in socialist cooperative relations.

    Once you have grasped the laws of water, you can use water to serve production. To use water, some people in the past advocated storing water. However, this is a low-lying plain, and the more water stored, the more severe the flooding. If the water isn't sent away quickly, there is a risk of disaster. Therefore, the correct approach can only be to focus on drainage, combined with irrigation and drainage. The so-called "drainage" is not passively waiting for upstream water to flood oneself, but to gradually overcome incoming water step by step according to objective laws. In the words of the farmers, it's called digging more ditches. Not digging randomly, but according to the water flow, according to the requirements of drainage and water use, and according to possibility and need. Digging ditches means establishing a water conservancy system that drains smoothly and has the potential to use water. Recognizing this problem also means gaining freedom. Party organizations at all levels in the Fuyang area adopted a method combining leadership, technical personnel, and the masses, planning comprehensively according to local conditions, leading the masses to dig ditches along the riverbanks according to contour lines and water flow, implementing high-water high-drainage, low-water low-drainage, digging ditches on gentle slopes, building terraced fields in low-lying areas, and building weirs in river beaches, and making large and small ditches interconnected and complementary, so that the water flows smoothly, greatly reducing the flooded area.

    Mao Zedong Thought has revealed the laws for overcoming water damage. The cadres and masses here all say that they suffered from flooding in the past mainly because of the idea of blocking water. Two different political thoughts yield two different results; blocking water or letting water pass is essentially a class struggle in the ideological field.

    Both Resist Disaster and "Avoid Disaster"

    A disaster area can only be said to have complete freedom after completely overcoming disasters. Under the condition that disasters exist, can people's subjective initiative be brought into play?

    Water management in this region is a long-term task. Is it only possible to solve the problem of grain self-sufficiency after the water is completely managed? Practical life proves that as long as we persist in struggle, we can continuously develop agricultural production in disaster areas in the process of water management, relatively quickly solve the problem of grain self-sufficiency, and gradually create a new situation.

    Water management requires fighting disasters head-on, but at the same time, we must also find ways to fight a roundabout war, going around natural disasters.

    Planting more spring sweet potatoes is the main means for the people of Fuyang area to resist and avoid disasters.

    Spring sweet potatoes were not developed in this area in the past, mainly because they were not recognized. Some people were enthusiastic about planting rice, but failed because there was no guarantee of water source; in the past, the planting of sweet potatoes was also promoted, but they were mostly stubble sweet potatoes, planted late and with low yields, sometimes even being flooded before they could be harvested. These comrades all wanted to strive for high yields, but at that time they only had a vague concept of high yields. They did not go to the masses to discover high-yield crops suitable for local disaster resistance conditions, and as a result, they were detached from reality and took some detours.

    Spring sweet potatoes can be planted early, have high yields, have a wide range of uses, and are beneficial for the masses to resist disasters. Should we support the masses in planting spring sweet potatoes? There was debate among the comrades in the Prefectural Party Committee. Individual comrades looked down on sweet potatoes, saying that sweet potatoes are not delicious, not nutritious, not substantial, and so on. As a result of the debate, most comrades believed that if the masses wanted to plant, they should be supported. They went to the masses to investigate. Commune members said: "You should have helped us plant more spring sweet potatoes a long time ago." Spring sweet potatoes are "iron crops." What if they are not delicious? The answer is: "Eat your fill first, then eat well." "We grind sweet potato chips into flour, mix them with soybean flour, and make steamed buns and noodles, which are all very delicious." The masses even made some criticisms, saying: "We said sweet potatoes are delicious, but you said they are not delicious." With sweet potatoes, we can grind flour to raise more pigs, and with more fertilizer, the land is stronger, and there will be more fine grains. Indeed, Linquan County is a good example. This county grows spring sweet potatoes, which not only developed production and improved the lives of the masses, but also developed rural sideline occupations. Last year, it purchased more than 10.4 million *jin* of vermicelli, worth 4 million yuan, which can be used to purchase nearly 20 million *jin* of chemical fertilizer. In March this year, in less than ten days, the masses purchased 5 million *jin* of chemical fertilizer for wheat topdressing. The vermicelli-making sideline industry also promoted the development of livestock. In 1965, compared to 1961, the county's large livestock increased by 40 percent, and pigs increased by 1.2 times.

    Do you want to grow other grain crops well in this disaster area? Then you must first grow spring sweet potatoes well. With it, you can eat less or even not eat supplied grain, and you also have production funds, livestock, and fertilizer, which creates material conditions for high yields of other crops. This can be said to be an example of the dialectics of people's struggle.

    Planting spring sweet potatoes raises a question with universal significance: in disaster areas, the objective situation is different, but the people certainly have their own weapons to resist disasters. As long as the leaders go deep among the masses, to discover and summarize these experiences, give support, and vigorously promote them, they can play a role in overcoming disasters.

    This area also attaches great importance to planting more wheat and other early-maturing crops. Let early-maturing crops be stable and high-yielding, so that the grain can be harvested before the water damage arrives. With grain in hand, you don't panic. This is another way to avoid and resist disasters. In the past, people always focused on autumn crops, but they were flooded as soon as the water came. After these years of practice, people finally understood that to strengthen the struggle against autumn water damage, they must plant and harvest more summer-maturing crops. The better the summer harvest, the higher the people's confidence in winning a good autumn harvest, and the greater the enthusiasm for fighting water disasters.

    Avoiding disaster sounds passive, but it is actually a realistic and positive way. This is a path to utilizing objective possibilities, reducing the threat of disaster, and even ultimately eliminating disaster in disaster area production.

    Disasters are Innate, Destiny is Determined by People

    In an old disaster area, the views of cadres and the masses on disasters are often a reflection of the struggle between two thoughts. Treating disasters with revolutionary thought means relying on the people to fight and overcome them, with the force for good always exceeding the force for evil. On the contrary, it means being weak and helpless in the face of disasters, turning into fatalists who blame heaven and earth.

    In the Fuyang area, we went to many places and saw the vigorous revolutionary spirit of the people under the leadership of the Party, rising up to overcome difficulties and seize bumper harvests. They despise "poverty" and are not afraid of difficulties. They are eradicating the roots of poverty in class struggle and production struggle. Revolution is creating everything.

    Let those who hold bourgeois views see what the poor people in our disaster areas still look like. Zhao Degang, a poor peasant-born feeder in the Xiguan Production Team of the Shuanggou Commune in Boxian County, carefully feeds thirteen cattle by himself. This poor peasant is an activist in studying Chairman Mao's works and a revolutionary backbone of the production team. One day, the cattle shed caught fire, and he bravely rescued the cattle from the fire. When rescuing the last cow, he was unfortunately burned by the fire and died after ineffective treatment. The Prefectural and County Party Committees discussed his revolutionary deeds, decided to commemorate him and learn from him throughout the area, and approved his application to join the Party, which he had made before his death. The leadership sent people to visit his mother and send some money. The mother said: "We have Chairman Mao and the collective as our backing. Please take the money to the production team to buy more livestock." What a great mother! In extreme grief, she thought not of herself but of the collective and the Party.

    Liu Da Niang, a 65-year-old member of the Yangmiaoqian Production Team of the Chengfu Commune in Boxian County, thought of applying fertilizer to the wheat in the fields when it snowed this spring. She said, "Jiao Yulu, the County Party Secretary, doesn't even ride a car; my son is the Production Team Leader, and he doesn't need to ride a car either." She obtained her son's consent and used the money she had prepared to buy a car to subsidize the collective's expenses for buying chemical fertilizer. This is a new relationship between mother and son in our socialist society. There are countless new people and new things that cannot be fully described.

    The people who have been tempered in the Socialist Education Movement and the disaster resistance struggle have driven away fatalistic ideas, and methods to overcome disasters have been put forward by the masses one by one. Advanced units of the Dazhai type have increased. In 1963, no production team here exceeded the "Program" in grain production. In 1964, there were 301 production units (teams, communes), and last year there were more than 4,000 production units whose grain production exceeded the "Program." Was there really none in the past? Perhaps they were not seen. Now, the leadership's thinking has been revolutionized. Advanced units are emerging one after another before our eyes. The view that disaster areas are only about "getting food" and cannot talk about "Dazhai" or the "Program" is a pessimistic view and cannot stand.

    The common characteristic of Dazhai-type in disaster areas is that they have a high revolutionary spirit, clever methods, and a quick turnaround. Many communes and teams have turned themselves around in almost one or two years.

    Why so fast? Class struggle has mobilized the long-accumulated revolutionary enthusiasm of the working people. In the past, thinking was not revolutionary, and disaster areas were seen as having many difficulties. Now, many favorable conditions have been seen. Take the Fuyang area as an example: First, the people have rich experience in struggle; second, there is a lot of land, and if one piece cannot be harvested, try to harvest another; third, there is a lot of water, which can be used for irrigation; fourth, two seasons can be planted, and if grain cannot be harvested, vegetables can also solve some problems; fifth, there are many ways to engage in diversified operations; sixth, some of the projects that were carried out in the past are gradually playing their role, and so on. These favorable conditions are the mainstream. When people grasp them, they can always find ways to maintain their lives in years of major disasters, and they can have a bumper harvest in years of minor disasters. More importantly, they can build stable and high-yield fields according to local conditions.

    There are many Dazhai in disaster areas, and they are very good! Dazhai in disaster areas have developed in the struggle against disaster resistance and have their own characteristics. If you try to understand them using the framework of general areas, you will not be able to recognize them.

    The Liuxi Brigade of the Liuxi Commune in Lixin County is the first Dazhai-style advanced typical example in the Fuyang area. Before 1957, this brigade had always been the focus of disaster relief. Starting in 1958, brigade cadres would take people to the fields to observe the water flow whenever it rained, mark it, and dig ditches after the rain. They finally found a set of scientific water management methods called "watch when it rains, work after the rain, watch again after work, work again after watching, excavate slope by slope, drain at the same elevation, form a self-contained system." Since then, the problem of waterlogging has been basically solved. While managing water, they developed diversified operations and sideline production, solving problems such as lack of livestock and fertilizer. Last year, despite more than 70 days of severe drought followed by more than 20 days of heavy rain, grain yield per *mu* increased from 310 *jin* in 1958 to 510 *jin*, exceeding the target of the "Program."

    In every county we visited, we heard comrades from all over the world talking about their own advanced typical examples. People have created experience in high wheat yields, high soybean and sorghum yields, and high sweet potato and cotton yields in the struggle against water and drought disasters, with their own hands. They also developed experience in raising large livestock and pigs. When disaster struck, some relied on mother donkeys to raise donkey mules to turn themselves around, some relied on a few sows to turn themselves around, and some, even though they had no grain harvest all year round, relied on growing carrots to withstand the disaster. Once the masses are mobilized, there are many ways to relieve and resist disasters and even strive for stable and high yields. This is by no means something that a few people sitting in a room can think of. Truly, fragrant grass is everywhere in Huaibei. Many methods are not mysterious at all. Once you say them, they are clear; once you use them, they are effective. "You can search everywhere but not find it, but it comes easily without effort." In fact, there is effort involved, and that is the great ideological revolution.

    One Joy, One Fear

    Disaster areas have a weak foundation. All work must proceed from the reality of disaster areas, protect vitality, and act according to capacity. We must establish the idea of ​​preparing for a long-term struggle by thinking of the worst-case scenario. There must be things to do, things to do less, and things not to do. Without this, the recovery and development of production in disaster areas will be interfered with.

    Pessimism has been driven away, and in the great good situation, blind optimism may rise again. Blind optimism and pessimism are twins. Our philosophy of struggle is to consciously wage struggle on two fronts.

    Take cotton planting as an example. Can we also concentrate on large-scale cotton fields like some stable-yield areas? No. This is a disaster area, and we must always adhere to the principle of grain first. Cotton should be planted, but it can only be planted in a scattered way, not competing with grain for ranking. This arrangement of the Provincial and Prefectural Party Committees has been supported by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

    Can the organs occupy some arable land to build dormitories? When comrades from the Provincial Party Committee discovered that some organs in a county in Huaibei were occupying arable land to build houses, they severely criticized them and stipulated that "occupying one *mu* of arable land must be approved by the Provincial Party Committee." One *mu* of land may seem like a small matter to some free-spending people. But the thinking behind one *mu* of land can damage the hard-won good situation. Comrades from the Fuyang Prefectural Party Committee are also relatively strict with themselves in this regard.

    Straightening roads and cutting corners is a good thing for the development of transportation; but occupying grain land in disaster areas, consuming the people's labor, and not being able to immediately turn the abandoned roads into farmland is a bad thing. The Prefectural Party Committee believes that as long as the current roads can be passable in both sunny and rainy weather, there is no need to change them, and resolutely concentrates the labor force on the production struggle. The comrades here remember one of the Provincial Party Committee's instructions: "Even if a road falls from the sky, don't change it," "Never forget that a year and a half ago, this was still a disaster area eating supplied grain."

    Running half-farming, half-study schools is also a good thing. However, if the development speed is too fast, too much land is occupied, and too many school buildings are built, it will not be conducive to the current economic recovery and development of disaster areas. Everyone believes that using wasteland to solve the problem of school land is even more feasible in the Huaibei area.

    Running rural health and cultural undertakings must also take into account the characteristics of disaster areas. Do not demand too much and do not force uniformity. For example, health undertakings should be gradually popularized, but not every health worker needs to have a health kit worth ten yuan. People should also voluntarily pay to see plays. However many people go is how many, do not use the method of apportioning money.

    The old disaster area has begun to turn around. This is a great joy. One joy, one fear. The joy is that cadres and the people have begun to use Mao Zedong Thought to control their own destiny and have a certain degree of freedom. The fear is that in the face of a good situation, the head is easily overheated. The better the situation, the more necessary it is to divide one into two. The Provincial Party Committee requires everyone to say nothing that is over the top, do nothing that is over the top, and leave room for everything. This is also a big question of whether or not we can persist in the revolutionary struggle to the end. Without dividing one into two, we cannot consolidate the existing achievements, let alone move forward. In a good situation, we must think more about the difficulties, find more gaps, and make more new demands on ourselves.

    Comrades from the CPC Fuyang Prefectural Committee said: "We have recognized the power of Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle, and now we have a little freedom." Freedom comes from Mao Zedong Thought taking command. They took class struggle as the key link, solved the relationship between people and disasters, and instead of being afraid, they fought, and began to grasp the initiative in the struggle against water damage. They summed up the experience of the masses, made reasonable arrangements for disaster resistance and the development of agricultural production, and established a practice of proceeding from the characteristics of disaster areas and adapting to local conditions. The direction and methods all emphasized politics. The door has been opened, and the road has been widened. Of course, there is still much work to be done to move from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom: the changes in natural phenomena are complex in the Huaibei area, and how to fight the weather is a big question. In production, old problems have been solved, and new problems have come. For example, the drainage problem has been initially solved, and drought resistance must be grasped. Disasters have gradually been reduced, and the problem of fertilizer shortage urgently needs to be solved. While grasping agriculture, we must also grasp diversified operations, which is a relatively weak link. While paying attention to production problems, we must also focus on the lives of the masses, especially solving the problem of firewood. Even greater are how to build stable and high-yield fields according to local conditions and how to realize agricultural modernization under the principle of self-reliance.

    In the struggle against disaster resistance, the ideological revolutionization of people is always the first priority. Visiting the Fuyang area, what we heard and saw showed that the disasters are great, but the power of the people who have mastered Mao Zedong Thought to resist disasters is even greater. There are many Jiao Yulu-style cadres and Lei Feng and Wang Jie-style figures here. Improving them politically and ideologically, excavating and spreading their revolutionary thoughts, qualities, and styles, and making them revolutionary examples that can be seen, touched, and learned by the broad masses of cadres and the masses, can further promote ideological revolutionization. When those who learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought in a living way become a large army, the strength to overcome disasters will be absolutely enhanced.

### 抗灾的活哲学  一个老灾区——阜阳专区突出政治发生的变化

    抗灾的活哲学
    一个老灾区——阜阳专区突出政治发生的变化
    灾区，特别是老灾区、重灾区，自然灾害频繁，有着很大的“必然王国”，没有被认识。这种地区能不能较快改变困难的局面呢？
    安徽阜阳专区的变化表明：人们思想上一旦突出了毛泽东思想，用斗争的哲学代替悲观的观点，会产生多么大的威力！
    阜阳地区是一个七百万人口的老灾区。这个地区十年九涝。解放之初到一九六四年上半年，全区农村群众由国家供应了四十三亿斤口粮。从一九六四年下半年起，尽管还有灾害，但是季季有较好的收成。一九六五年同一九六三年雨量大体相等，成灾面积却从一千四百万亩缩小到五百万亩。这年粮食产量达到了历史上最高水平，向国家交售了十亿多斤粮食；养猪头数超过历史上最高水平，卖给国家六十万头肥猪；大牲畜比一九六四年增加百分之十三；购买力和丰收的一九五七年相比，增长百分之二十左右。这个大变化，来得比人们预料的早。
    变化的根本原因是什么？是外力的支援吗？不是。我们征求了许多干部和社员的意见，共同的看法：是社会主义教育运动的伟大作用，是阶级斗争成了战胜灾害的动力，是贫农下中农组成了革命的队伍，巩固壮大了集体经济，是用辩证思想为武器，初步掌握了抗灾生产的规律性，取得了斗争的自由。
    “让，才能主动”
    淮河洪水泛滥的灾害，从一九五四年起基本被制止了。但是，淮北地区的内涝，还是严重的灾害。
    怎样同内涝作斗争呢？
    水往低处流。承认它，治水就有自由；不承认它，就不会有自由。
    但是，能不能认识事物的这种规律性，这里面也有阶级斗争的问题。旧社会带来的阶级局限性、旧习惯、旧观点，是不打不倒的。在这里，堵水的思想就是旧事物。历史上，阜阳地区地主阶级和资产阶级各霸一方，欺骗和胁迫群众，到处筑坝挡水，水从那里入境，就在那里设防。因此，在省与省，县与县，这个势力范围与那个势力范围接界的地方，都筑了大量的土坝挡水。结果，逼使洪水横流，首先淹了上游，挡不住了，再淹下游。因此，下游筑坝和上游平坝，就成了这个地区多年的矛盾和纠纷。解放以后，这种封建割据的思想影响表现为一种习惯势力，以为堵住水就维护了群众的利益。实际上，这不是战胜水害，而是各保一方的悲观论点，是分散主义，而不是马克思主义。
    水是堵不住的。堵水，想的是把水害留给别人，最后水还是回到自己身边，同样吃苦头。
    要战胜水害，就要承认：第一，水是要流的。第二，水是要往低处流的。第三，上游下游合力对付水，水是可以战胜的。承认这三点，是经过严重的思想斗争的。在斗争中，树立了团结治水的全局观点，下游主动地为上游让水。一九六四年春季，安徽省委坚决执行党中央的指示，领导淮北广大地区广大群众动手平毁挡水堤坝。阜阳专区与河南省交界的临泉、界首、亳县、涡阳、太和、阜南六县，平毁了一百二十处。在专区各县之间平毁了一百五十九处。根据水的流向，上游有多少水，尽管放；该平毁什么地方，上游提要求，下游就平，平了还请上游检查验收。阜阳地区不少共产党员，在这次让水平坝中，认识到自己不是那一个地区的共产党员，而是中国共产党员，不但要代表下游人民的利益，还要代表上游人民的利益，更要代表全国人民的利益。贫农下中农说，只有在党和毛主席的领导下，天下农民才能是一家。在旧社会，我们是被迫为地主的利益而打架，死的伤的都是自己的亲人，没有一个地主。
    千百年历史上遗留下来的问题，就这样解决了。长期形成的封建割据的习惯势力，也就这样打破了。
    我们去的涡阳县新兴区，与河南永城县交界，是有名的老灾区。一九六三年土堤挡不住上游洪水，全区有三十七处决口，六十三个村子完全被水包围。区委书记看到堵水不成，便趟着齐腰的大水去观察水情。他们查清了区内水的流向，还去河南上游摸清了来水的情况。从趟水调查中，他们懂得了让水流下去比堵水好，决心接受上游来水。区委领导群众把全区挡水工程通通平毁，同时把区内一些互不相连的水沟，根据水的流向挖通。一九六五年又发生大水，水排得就比较快，灾害大大减轻，仍然得到了较好的收成。
    这件事看起来解决的是水利问题，实际上是个很大的政治问题。在我们社会主义社会，全国是一盘棋，局部应当为整体服务。团结，才能形成拳头去战胜敌人。在淮北治水中，具有伟大意义的一句话鼓舞着人们前进，这就是“让，才能主动”。下游让水，就是要牺牲某些局部利益来换取全局利益。只有让水流下去，才能治水。“让，才能主动”，体现出上下游社会主义的新关系。这句革命名言，在社会主义协作关系中，有普遍的指导意义。
    摸到了水的规律，才能用水为生产服务。为了用水，过去有人主张蓄水。但是，这里是低洼平原，蓄水越多，受淹越重。水来了不及早送走，就有受灾危险。因此，正确的方针只能是以排为主、排灌结合。所谓“排”，不是消极地等着上游来水淹自己，而是按照客观规律一步一步战胜来水。用农民的话说，叫做多挖沟。不是乱挖，而是按照水的流向，按照排水与用水的要求，按照可能与需要去挖。挖沟就是建立一个排水通畅、并且有可能用水的水利系统。认识了这个问题也就有了自由。阜阳地区各级党组织采取领导、技术人员、群众相结合的办法，因地制宜，全面规划，领导群众在沿河地带按等高线和水的流向开沟，实行高水高排，低水低排，在平坡地挖沟，低洼地修台田条田，河滩地圈圩，并使大小沟互相贯通配套，这样水流畅通，大大缩小了受涝面积。
    毛泽东思想揭开了战胜水害的规律。这里的干部、群众都这样说：过去受淹，主要是吃了堵水思想的苦头。两种政治思想得到两种结果，堵水还是让水，实质上是思想领域里的一场阶级斗争。
    既要抗灾，也要“避灾”
    灾区，在彻底战胜灾害之后，才算是有了彻底的自由。在灾害存在的条件下，人的主观能动作用能不能得到发挥呢？
    这个地区治水是长期的任务，是不是只能等待完全治好了水，才能解决粮食自给的问题呢？实际生活证明，只要坚持斗争，完全可以在治水的过程中，不断发展灾区的农业生产，比较快地解决粮食自给问题，逐步创造出一个新局面来。
    治水，要同灾害打正面战，同时，也要想办法打迂回战，绕着天灾走。
    多种一些春红薯是阜阳地区人民抗灾、避灾的主要手段。
    春红薯过去在这个地区没有发展起来，主要是不认识它。有人热中于栽稻子，但因水源没有保证而失败了；过去也推广过种红薯，但多是麦茬红薯，种得晚产量低，有时甚至赶不上收就被淹掉了。这些同志都想争取高产，但是，当时只有笼统的高产概念。没有到群众中去发现适合当地抗灾条件的高产作物，结果，脱离了实际，走了一些弯路。
    春红薯，可以早种，产量高，用途广，有利于群众抵抗灾害。要不要支持群众种春红薯？在地委同志中是有争论的。个别同志看不起红薯，说红薯不好吃，营养不丰富，不过硬，等等。争论的结果，多数同志认为，群众要种就应当支持群众。他们到群众中去摸底。社员说：“你们早就应该帮助我们多种春红薯。”春红薯是“铁打的庄稼”。不好吃怎么办？回答是：“先吃饱，后吃好。”“我们把红薯干磨成面，掺上黄豆粉，做蒸馍做面条，都好吃得很。”群众甚至提出一些批评说：“我们说红薯好吃，是你们说不好吃。”有了红薯，可以磨粉多养猪，肥料多了，土地壮了，细粮也就多了。的确，临泉县就是一个好例子。这个县种春红薯，不仅发展了生产，改善了群众生活，农村副业也得到发展。去年收购了一千零四十多万斤粉丝，价值四百万元，可以购买近两千万斤化肥，今年三月间不到十天中，群众就购买了五百万斤化肥作小麦追肥。制粉副业还促进了牲畜的发展，一九六五年比一九六一年，全县大牲畜增加了百分之四十，猪增加了一点二倍。
    你要在这个灾区种好其他的粮食作物吗？那就先要种好春红薯。有了它，就可以少吃以至不吃供应粮，也有了生产资金，有了牲畜和肥料，这样，就给其他作物的高产创造了物质条件。这可以说是人民斗争辩证法的一例。
    种春红薯，提出了一个有普遍意义的问题：在灾区，客观情况不同，但人民群众中肯定有自己抵抗灾害的武器。只要领导者深入群众，去发掘、总结这些经验，给予支持，大力推广，就能发挥战胜灾害的作用。
    这个地区也很重视多种小麦及其他早熟作物。让早熟作物稳产高产，在水害到来前，先把粮食收到手。手中有粮，心中不慌。这是又一个避灾和抗灾的办法。过去，人们总是把眼睛看在秋季作物上，但是水一来就被淹掉。经过这些年的实践，人们终于懂得了：要加强同秋季的水害作斗争，就必须多种多收夏熟作物，夏季收成越好，人们夺取秋季好收成的信心越高，同水灾作斗争的劲头就越大。
    避灾，听起来是消极的，实际上是既实事求是，又积极进取的办法。这是在灾区生产中利用客观可能性，减少灾害威胁，以至最后消灭灾害的一条道路。
    灾是天生，命由人定
    一个老灾区，干部和群众中对于灾的看法，常常是两种思想斗争的反映。用革命的思想对待灾荒，就是依靠人民战而胜之，魔高一尺，道高一丈。相反的，就是在灾害面前软弱无力，变成怨天怨地的宿命论者。
    在阜阳地区，我们走了很多地方，看到的是人民在党的领导下奋起战胜困难、夺取丰收的蓬蓬勃勃的革命精神。他们藐视“穷”，不怕难。在阶级斗争和生产斗争中挖掉穷根。革命正在创造一切。
    让那些抱着资产阶级观点的人看看我们的灾区人民还有什么穷相吧。亳县双沟公社西关生产队一位贫农出身的饲养员赵德光，他一个人精心喂养十三头牛。这个贫农是学习毛主席著作的积极分子，是生产队的革命骨干。一天，牛棚着火了，他奋不顾身从大火中抢救牛，抢到最后一头牛，不幸被大火烧伤，救治无效，牺牲了。地委、县委讨论了他的革命事迹，决定在全区范围纪念他，学习他，并且批准了他生前提出的入党要求。领导上派人去看望他的母亲，送去一些钱。这位母亲说：“我们有毛主席，有集体的靠山，请把钱拿去给生产队再买牲口。”这是多么伟大的母亲！她在极端悲痛中想到的不是自己而是集体，而是党。
    亳县城父公社杨庙前生产队六十五岁的刘大娘，今年春天下雪，想到地里麦子要追化肥。她说，“焦裕禄是县委书记，连车子都不骑；我儿是生产队长，他不需要骑车子。”她征得儿子的同意，把准备买车的钱垫到集体买化肥的费用中去。这是在我们社会主义社会中母子的新关系。无数新人新事，是说不完，道不尽的。
    社会主义教育运动和抗灾斗争中锻炼出来的人，把宿命论的思想赶跑了，战胜灾害的办法一个个从群众中提出来了。大寨式的先进单位多起来了。一九六三年这里没有一个生产队的粮食产量超过“纲要”，一九六四年就有了三百零一个生产单位（队、社），去年已有四千多个生产单位粮食产量超过了“纲要”。是不是过去就真的一个没有呢？恐怕是没有看见。现在，领导思想革命化了。一个个先进单位都涌现在自己的眼前。那种以为灾区是“搞饭吃”，谈不上“大寨”，谈不上上“纲要”的说法，是悲观的论调，完全站不住脚。
    灾区大寨有一个共同特点是，革命精神昂扬，办法巧妙，翻身很快。许多社、队差不多都是一两年就翻了身。
    为什么这么快呢？阶级斗争把劳动人民蓄藏已久的革命积极性调动起来了。过去思想不革命，看灾区看困难多，现在，看到了许许多多的有利条件。拿阜阳地区来说，就有：一，人的斗争经验丰富；二，土地多，收不了这块，争取收那块；三，水多，可以搞灌溉；四，可以种两季，收不了粮食，收菜也能解决一些问题；五，多种经营门路多；六，过去搞的一些工程正在逐步发挥效益等等。这些有利条件是主流，人们掌握了它，大灾之年总有办法维持住自己生活，轻灾可以丰收，更重要的是可以因地制宜地建设稳产高产田。
    灾区的大寨多得很，也好得很！灾区大寨是在抗灾斗争中发展起来的，带有自己的特色。如果用一般地区的框子套，是不能认识的。
    利辛县柳西公社柳西大队是阜阳地区第一个大寨式先进典型。一九五七年以前，这个大队一直是救灾的重点。一九五八年开始，大队干部每逢下雨就带着人下田察看水流，作上记号，雨后挖沟，终于找到一套科学的治水办法，叫作“下雨看，雨后干，干后再看，看了再干，逐坡开挖，等高排水，自成系统”。从此基本上解决了内涝问题。他们在治水的同时，发展了多种经营和副业生产，解决了缺乏牲畜、肥料等问题。去年，尽管先是七十多天的大旱，接着又是二十多天大雨，粮食单产却由一九五八年的三百一十斤增加到五百一十斤，超过了“纲要”的指标。
    我们访问的每个县，都听到各地同志谈他们自己的先进典型。人们靠一双双手，在与水旱灾害斗争中，创造了小麦高产的经验，大豆高粱高产的经验，红薯和棉花高产的经验，发展大牲畜和养猪的经验。受灾了，有的靠了母驴养驴骡翻了身，有的靠几头母猪翻了身，有的虽然全年粮食无收，靠种胡萝卜也顶住了灾。人民群众一经发动起来，救灾抗灾以至争取稳产高产的办法多得很。这决不是少数人坐在屋子里能想出来的，真是淮北遍地皆芳草。许多办法说来一点也不神秘，一说就明，一用就灵。“踏破铁鞋无觅处，得来全不费功夫”。其实，功夫是有的，这就是思想大革命。
    一则以喜，一则以惧
    灾区，底子薄。一切工作都要从灾区的实际出发，保护元气，量力而行。要树立从最坏处着想准备长期斗争的思想。要有所为，有所少为，还要有所不为。没有这一条，灾区生产的恢复和发展就要受到干扰。
    悲观论，被赶跑了，在大好形势下，盲目乐观情绪又会抬头，盲目乐观同悲观是双胞胎。我们的斗争哲学就是要自觉地在两个战线上进行斗争。
    拿种棉来说吧，能不能也象一些稳产地区那样集中搞大片棉田呢？不能。这里是灾区，要始终坚持粮食第一的原则。棉花要种，但只能分散地种，不要同粮食争名次。省委地委的这种安排受到了广大贫农下中农的拥护。
    机关可以不可以占些耕地盖宿舍呢？省委同志在淮北一个县发现有的机关占用耕地盖房子，提出了严厉批评，规定了“占用一亩耕地，一定要请示省委批准”。一亩地，在某些大手大脚的人看来，也许是小事。但一亩地背后反映的思想，却可以损坏得来不易的好形势。阜阳地委同志们在这方面对自己的要求也是比较严格的。
    公路裁弯取直，就交通事业的发展来说，是好事；但要占用灾区粮地，耗费民力，废了的路又不能马上变为农田，就是坏事。地委认为现在的路只要能晴雨通车，就没有改的必要，坚决把劳力集中到生产斗争中去。这里的同志们牢记省委的一次指示：“即使从天上掉下一条路，也不要改”，“永远不要忘记在一年半以前，这里还是吃供应粮的灾区”。
    办半农半读学校也是好事。但是，如果发展速度过快，占地过多，盖校舍多，却不利于当前灾区经济的恢复和发展。大家认为，用开荒地的办法解决学校用地问题，在淮北地区更有条件。
    办农村卫生文化事业，也要照顾灾区特点，不要要求过高，不必强求一律。例如，卫生事业要逐步普及，但不必每一个卫生员都要有一个十元钱一只的保健箱。戏也应由群众自愿出钱去看，有多少人看就是多少人，不用摊钱的办法。
    老灾区开始翻身了，这是大喜事。一则以喜，一则以惧。喜的是干部和人民开始运用毛泽东思想掌握自己的命运，在一定程度上有了自由。惧的是在好形势面前头脑容易发热。形势越是好起来，越要一分为二。省委要求大家不说过头话，不做过头事，处处事事都要留有余地，这一条也是能不能坚持革命斗争到底的大问题。没有两分法就不能巩固已有成果，更不能前进。在大好形势下，要多想些困难，多找些差距，多向自己提些新的要求。
    中共阜阳地委同志说：“我们从斗争中认识了毛泽东思想的力量，现在有了一点自由了。”自由来自毛泽东思想挂帅。他们以阶级斗争为纲，解决了人同灾害的关系，不是怕，而是斗争，开始掌握了同水害作斗争的主动权。他们总结人民群众经验，作出了抗灾发展农业生产的合理安排，确立了从灾区特点出发因地制宜的做法。方向和办法都突出了政治。大门打开了，路子走宽了。当然，从必然王国走向自由王国，还有许多工作要做：自然现象的变化在淮北地区是复杂的，如何同天气作斗争是一门大学问。在生产上，老问题解决了，新问题又来了，如排水问题初步解决了，抗旱就要抓起来。灾害逐步减轻了，缺肥料问题又迫切需要解决。抓住了农业，还要抓住多种经营，而这一点是比较薄弱的环节。重视了生产问题，还要狠抓群众生活，特别是解决烧柴问题。更大的还有如何因地制宜建立稳产高产田，以及在自力更生原则下实现农业现代化等。
    在抗灾斗争中，人的思想革命化永远是第一位的。访问阜阳地区，耳闻目见，发现灾大，掌握了毛泽东思想的人民抗灾的力量更大。这里有着为数众多的焦裕禄式的干部和雷锋、王杰式的人物的苗头。从政治上思想上提高他们，把他们的革命思想、品质、风格发掘出来，传播开去，使之在广大干部群众中成为看得见，摸得着，学得到的革命榜样，就能够进一步促进思想革命化。活学活用毛泽东思想的人成了大军，战胜灾害的力量就会绝对地增强起来。
