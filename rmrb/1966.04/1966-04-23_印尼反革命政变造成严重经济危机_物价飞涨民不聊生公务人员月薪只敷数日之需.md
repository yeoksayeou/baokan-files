    (Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 21st dispatch) Since the Indonesian right-wing generals' group launched a counter-revolutionary coup in October last year, it has been carrying out frenzied massacres, plunder, and destruction within the country, severely damaging Indonesia's national economy and bringing the country's economy to the brink of collapse. This is the most serious problem currently facing the right-wing military regime, indicating that its foundation of rule is very fragile.
    According to reports from Antara News Agency and Western news agencies, Indonesian Deputy Prime Minister Sultan Hamengkubuwono XII admitted at a press conference that Indonesia's "currency has been constantly inflating. Prices in 1965 rose fivefold. The price of Indonesia's staple food, rice, rose fivefold in that year. Prices this year may rise tenfold."
    Due to inflation, soaring prices, and severe shortages of goods, Buwono admitted that "the most serious deficit situation appeared in the first three months of this year. From January to March alone, the national budget deficit was close to the entire government expenditure in 1965." The national budget deficit in 1965 had already reached thirty times the gross national income.
    Buwono also said that the Indonesian government's "budget has no money, exports are still decreasing, and the government has $2.4 billion in foreign debt." "Due to the difficulty in obtaining foreign exchange, it has also severely limited the country's ability to import the materials and equipment it needs for industrial development, which has greatly reduced the quantity of industrial products."
    Because of the perverse actions of the Indonesian right-wing generals' group, according to the *Los Angeles Times*, prices have soared in the past six months. "Since the beginning of October (last year), the overall price index has risen at least tenfold. The price of rice alone has doubled since the beginning of 1966."
    Even *Angkatan Bersenjata*, the organ of the Indonesian Army, admitted that due to severe economic difficulties, the broad masses of the people have suffered serious disasters. Taking civil servants, whose living standards are far higher than those of the general public, as an example, according to a report in *Angkatan Bersenjata* on the 8th, their monthly salaries are only enough to maintain their lives for three to four days.

    印尼反革命政变造成严重经济危机
    物价飞涨民不聊生公务人员月薪只敷数日之需
    据新华社二十一日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派将领集团在去年十月发动反革命政变以来，在国内疯狂进行大屠杀、大掠夺和大破坏，严重摧残了印度尼西亚的民族经济，使这个国家的经济濒于崩溃。这是右派军人政权目前面临的最严重的难题，表明它的统治基础十分脆弱。
    据安塔拉通讯社和西方通讯社报道，印度尼西亚内阁副总理苏丹·哈孟库·布沃诺十二日在一次记者招待会上承认，印度尼西亚的“通货一直不断膨胀。一九六五年的物价涨到五倍。印度尼西亚的主食大米的价格在这一年内涨到五倍。今年的物价可能涨到十倍”。
    由于通货膨胀、物价飞涨，物资奇缺，布沃诺承认，“最严重的赤字情况出现在今年的头三个月。仅在一月至三月之间，国家预算的赤字已大到接近一九六五年政府的全部开支。”而一九六五年国家预算的赤字已达国民总收入的三十倍。
    布沃诺还说，印度尼西亚政府的“预算中没有钱，出口仍在减少，政府有二十四亿美元的外债。”“由于难以得到外汇，还严重地限制了国家进口它在工业发展方面所需要的物资和器材的能力，这就使得工业品数量大大下降。”
    由于印度尼西亚右派将领集团倒行逆施，据《洛杉矶时报》报道，半年以来，物价飞涨。“自从（去年）十月初以来，总的物价指数至少上涨了十倍。单是大米价格自一九六六年初以来就翻了一番。”
    甚至印度尼西亚陆军的机关报《武装部队报》也承认，由于严重的经济困难，广大人民遭到严重的灾难。就以生活水平远远高出一般人民的公务员为例，据《武装部队报》八日报道，他们所得的月薪只够维持三至四天的生活。
