    Xinhua News Agency, April 12th. The Agricultural Mechanization Hall of the National Agricultural Exhibition Center officially opened to visitors from all over the country on the 12th.

    The Agricultural Mechanization Hall, including the farm implement hall and the plaza exhibition area, is an important component of the National Agricultural Exhibition Center. This is the first time since the founding of New China that such a large-scale agricultural mechanization exhibition has been held. It centrally displays the important achievements and experiences that our country has already made in promoting the great and arduous historical task of agricultural mechanization. Under the brilliant banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and under the correct leadership of the Party, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and scientific and technological personnel have given full play to their creative talents. Our country's agricultural mechanization has started from scratch, grown from small to large, and, according to the path pointed out by the Party for developing our own agricultural mechanization, has begun to take a major step forward.

    The main content of the Agricultural Mechanization Hall includes: the six red banners of developing agricultural mechanization by carrying forward the spirit of Dazhai and relying on the collective economy; ten models of state-owned agricultural machinery stations and other departments serving agricultural production wholeheartedly; fifteen advanced units of handicrafts supporting agriculture; and more than 1,300 pieces of agricultural machinery and tools designed and manufactured according to the characteristics of agricultural production in our country, including: semi-mechanized agricultural tools, irrigation and drainage machinery, threshing and processing machinery, transportation tools, plant protection machinery, animal husbandry machinery, forestry machinery, tractors and their supporting agricultural tools, farmland capital construction machinery, maintenance equipment, and power machinery.

    Promoting agricultural mechanization is an important task of socialist construction in our country, and a great technological revolution to fundamentally change the backward state of agricultural production in our country. The many pictures, charts, models, and various agricultural machinery and tools exhibited in the Agricultural Mechanization Hall profoundly embody the cordial care and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao for the development of our country's agricultural mechanization, and vividly reflect the revolutionary spirit of our people holding high the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhering to self-reliance, and striving for progress, in the arduous work and gratifying achievements made in agricultural mechanization. The materials exhibited prove that only the revolutionary people who have embarked on collectivization can realize socialist agricultural mechanization. In places where agriculture has achieved semi-mechanization and mechanization, it has played a significant role in increasing labor productivity, increasing agricultural yield per unit area, resolving the contradiction between production development and labor shortages, ensuring timely planting, improving cultivation levels, resisting natural disasters, promoting agricultural production to advance in depth and breadth, increasing collective and commune members' income, consolidating the collective economy of the people's communes, and improving commune members' socialist consciousness. The advanced experience and deeds of the exhibiting units fully prove Chairman Mao's scientific thesis: the fundamental way out for agriculture lies in mechanization.

    全国农业展览馆农业机械化馆正式展出
    新华社十二日讯　全国农业展览馆的农业机械化馆，十二日正式开馆接待各地观众。
    农业机械化馆包括农具馆和广场展区，是全国农业展览馆的一个重要组成部分。举办这样规模巨大的农业机械化展览，新中国成立以来这还是第一次。它集中地显示我国在推行农业机械化这项伟大、艰巨的历史任务方面，已经取得了一些重要的成就和经验。在毛泽东思想伟大红旗照耀下，在党的正确领导下，广大工人、农民和科学技术人员，充分发挥自己的创造才能，我国农业机械化已经从无到有，从小到大，按照党所指引的我们自己的发展农业机械化的道路，开始迈出了一大步。
    农业机械化馆展出的主要内容有：发扬大寨精神，依靠集体经济，发展农业机械化的六面红旗；国营农业机械站管理等部门全心全意为农业生产服务的十个样板；手工业支援农业的十五个先进单位；以及根据我国农业生产特点设计、制造的一千三百多件农机具，其中包括：半机械化农具、排灌机械、脱粒加工机具、运输工具、植物保护机具、畜牧机具、林业机具、拖拉机及其配套农具、农田基本建设机具、维修设备、动力机械等。
    推行农业机械化是我国社会主义建设的一项重要任务，是从根本上改变我国农业生产落后面貌的伟大的技术革命。农业机械化馆展出的许多图片、图表、模型和各种农机具，深刻地体现了党中央和毛主席对于发展我国农业机械化事业的亲切关怀和正确领导，生动地反映我国人民高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚持自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神，在农业机械化方面所进行的艰巨的工作和获得的可喜的成就。展出的材料证明，只有走上集体化的革命人民，才有可能实现社会主义的农业机械化。凡是农业实现了半机械化和机械化的地方，就在提高劳动生产率，提高农业单位面积产量，解决生产发展和劳动力不足之间的矛盾，保证适时耕种，提高耕作水平，抵抗自然灾害，促进农业生产向深度和广度进军，增加集体和社员收入，巩固人民公社集体经济和提高社员的社会主义觉悟等方面，都起了显著的作用。展出单位的先进经验和事迹充分证明了毛主席的科学论断：农业的根本出路在于机械化。
