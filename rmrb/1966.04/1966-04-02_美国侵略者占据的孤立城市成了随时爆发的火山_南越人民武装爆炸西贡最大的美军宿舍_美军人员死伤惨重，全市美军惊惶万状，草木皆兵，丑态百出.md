Editor's Note: The largest American military dormitory in Saigon has again been attacked and blown up by the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces, causing heavy casualties to the American invaders. The news is very gratifying.
    This successful raid, like many similar raids in the past, not only demonstrates the bravery and resourcefulness of the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces, but also shows that the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces have a flesh-and-blood relationship with the broad masses of the people. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out that if the army is seen as its own army in the eyes of the people, this army will be invincible. The South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces are precisely such a people's army that is loved and supported by the people, so they can be invincible and victorious in the battle against the enemy, creating many amazing miracles.
    Saigon is the stronghold of the American puppets, and the strict security is conceivable. Especially after this den of American puppets has been bombed repeatedly, the American invaders and their lackeys have strengthened their defenses a hundredfold. Despite this, they still cannot prevent the elusive South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces from penetrating deep into the enemy's nest and displaying their great power. Without the cover and support of the masses, how could the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces advance and retreat with such ease? If Saigon is like this, then the other American puppet strongholds are even more predictable.
    After massively increasing its troops this year, the American aggressor attempts to launch a series of offensives to realize its so-called "ink stain strategy" and expand its occupied areas. These offensives have been smashed one by one by the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces. Facts have proven that not only is the American aggressor unable to occupy the liberated areas, but even some isolated strongholds it occupies are difficult to protect. The recent surge of political struggles by the people in the enemy-occupied areas, as well as the bombing of the American military dormitory this time, fully prove that the American aggressors and their running dogs are having an increasingly difficult time. Johnson and his ilk have recently been boasting about how the American aggressor army has "gained the initiative" and how the situation in South Vietnam has "improved," which is really just pretending to be fat while slapping his face swollen, both pitiful and ridiculous.
    According to Xinhua News Agency on the 1st: Saigon News: The South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces attacked and blew up the "Victoria Hotel," one of the largest American military dormitories in Saigon, in the downtown area of Saigon on the morning of the 1st, causing heavy casualties to the American invaders.
    According to initial reports from Western news agencies, hundreds of American military personnel have been found dead or injured. However, an American officer at the scene admitted that the number of deaths and injuries in this explosion may be even greater than the deaths and injuries in the bombing of the Saigon American military dormitory "Metropole Hotel" on December 4 last year.
    The attack and explosion took place around 5 a.m. on the 1st. The People's Armed Forces first used light weapons and grenades to kill the military police and police guarding the entrance. Then, a car loaded with explosives rushed to the entrance of the hotel. Before long, the explosives detonated violently, and the sound of the explosion could be heard six kilometers away.
    According to Western news agency reporters who rushed to the scene, the bottom five floors of this ten-story building were destroyed. The first, second, and third floors were a mess, and almost none of the American military personnel living on the first floor survived. The wall on the fifth floor also collapsed. After the explosion, the American military authorities sent many people to the scene to excavate the dead and injured personnel. Ambulances went back and forth to pull the dead and injured away. It is reported that when the People's Armed Forces attacked this American military dormitory, the American military personnel inside panicked after hearing the gunshots and explosions, scrambling to escape. Some people hurriedly fled to the bathroom to hide, some crawled under the bed, and some lay on the floor and covered themselves with the mattresses on the bed, presenting a scene of embarrassment and ugliness.
    According to Xinhua News Agency on the 1st: Saigon News: After the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces attacked and blew up the "Victoria Hotel," one of the largest American military dormitories in Saigon, on the morning of the 1st, the American invading troops in Saigon were all frightened and developed nervous disorders, suspecting everything, and seeing ghosts everywhere, causing a lot of farces. According to United Press International, after the explosion, all American military dormitories in Saigon immediately "entered a state of high alert," fearing another bombing. The report said: "Less than three hours after the explosion at the 'Victoria Hotel,' two other American military facilities also experienced false alarms of bomb explosions, causing bomb disposal teams and military police to take action." "When an unidentified Vietnamese man pushed a car in front of the 'American Military Field Hospital' near Tan Son Nhut Airport," the puppet police, who were frightened out of their wits, thought the car was loaded with explosives and blew their whistles desperately. "Bomb disposal teams and reinforcements rushed to the area." They searched with trepidation, and "found no explosives," and the man was just "pushing his malfunctioning car." It is reported that an hour after the car farce ended, another farce was staged in front of the "International Officers' Dormitory" in Saigon. United Press International reported: "Nervous guards noticed a suspicious pile of garbage in front of the dormitory." They again treated it as a major enemy and immediately summoned "bomb disposal team personnel" to the scene. They "searched through the pile of garbage," but "found nothing abnormal."

    美国侵略者占据的孤立城市成了随时爆发的火山
    南越人民武装爆炸西贡最大的美军宿舍
    美军人员死伤惨重，全市美军惊惶万状，草木皆兵，丑态百出
    编者按：西贡最大的美军宿舍又遭到了南越人民武装的袭击和爆炸，美国侵略者伤亡惨重。消息传来，大快人心。
    这次成功的奇袭，同过去历次类似的奇袭一样，不仅显示了南越人民武装的勇敢和机智，而且表明了南越人民武装同广大人民有着血肉相连的关系。毛泽东同志曾经指出，使军队在民众眼睛中看成是自己的军队，这个军队便无敌于天下。南越人民武装正是这样一支受到人民爱戴和支持的人民军队，所以他们能够在同敌人的战斗中无往不利，无往不胜，创造出许许多多惊人的奇迹。
    西贡是美伪的大本营，戒备之森严是可以想见的。特别是这个美伪的巢穴一再挨炸之后，美国侵略者及其走狗，更是百倍地加强防备。尽管如此，他们仍然防止不了神出鬼没的南越人民武装深入敌巢，大显神威。如果没有人民群众的掩护和支持，南越人民武装怎么可能这样进退裕如呢？西贡尚且如此，其他的美伪据点，就更可想而知了。
    美国侵略者今年在大量增兵之后，妄图发动一系列攻势，实现它的所谓“墨渍战略”，扩大其占领区。这些攻势已经一个一个被南越人民武装力量所粉碎。事实证明，不仅美国侵略者无力侵据解放区，而且连它所盘踞的一些孤立据点也难以自保。最近敌占区人民政治斗争的风起云涌，以及这一次美军宿舍的挨炸，都充分证明，美国侵略者及其走狗的日子越来越不好过。约翰逊之流近来竟然大吹特吹什么美国侵略军已“取得了主动权”，什么南越的局面已经“好转”，这真是打肿脸充胖子，既可怜而又可笑。
    据新华社一日讯　西贡消息：越南南方人民武装一日清晨在西贡闹区袭击并爆炸了西贡最大的美军宿舍之一的“维多利亚饭店”，使美国侵略者遭到惨重的伤亡。
    据西方通讯社的初步消息说，已发现有上百名美军人员被炸死炸伤。但是一个在现场的美国军官承认，这次爆炸死伤的人数可能比去年十二月四日爆炸西贡美军宿舍“大都会饭店”时死伤的还多。
    这次袭击和爆炸是在一日清晨五时左右进行的。人民武装首先用轻武器和手榴弹打死在门口警卫的宪兵和警察。接着，一辆装载着炸药的汽车冲到了饭店的门口。不一会，炸药发生了剧烈的爆炸，爆炸声在六公里以外都能听到。
    据赶往现场的西方通讯社记者说，这座十层的大楼底下的五层被炸毁了。第一、二、三层被炸得一片狼藉，住在第一层的美军人员几乎没有一个活的。第五层的墙也倒塌了。爆炸发生以后，美军当局派了许多人到现场去挖掘死伤的人员。救护车往返不停地把死伤者拉走。据报道，在人民武装袭击这座美军宿舍时，里边的美军人员听到枪声和爆炸声以后，乱作一团，争相逃命。有的人急忙逃往洗澡间躲藏起来，有的人钻到了床底下去，有的人趴在地板上并且把床上的垫子盖在身上，一片狼狈的丑态。
    据新华社一日讯　西贡消息：越南南方人民武装一日清晨袭击并爆炸了西贡最大的美军宿舍之一的“维多利亚饭店”后，西贡的美国侵略军一个个都被吓得患了吃惊病，疑神疑鬼，草木皆兵，闹了不少丑剧。据合众国际社报道，在爆炸发生后，西贡所有的美军宿舍马上“全部处于高度警戒状态”，害怕再次挨炸。报道说：“在‘维多利亚饭店’爆炸后不到三小时，另外两个美军设施也发生了爆炸炸弹的虚惊，使炸弹处理小组和宪兵投入了行动。”“当一名身份不明的越南人在新山一机场附近的‘美军野战医院’的门前推一辆轿车时”，被吓破了胆的伪警察以为车上装的是炸弹，便没命地吹起哨子。“炸弹处理小组和增援部队都赶到这个地区”。他们胆战心惊地进行搜查的结果，“没有发现任何爆炸品”，而那个人只不过是“推了一下他那发生故障的车子”。据报道，在车子丑剧演完后一小时，另一出丑剧又在西贡“国际军官宿舍”前面演出。合众国际社的报道说：“神经紧张的卫兵注意到在宿舍前面有一堆可疑的垃圾”。他们又如临大敌，立刻把“处理炸弹小组人员”召到现场。他们“翻遍了这堆垃圾”，但是“没有发现任何不正常的东西”。（附图片）
