    The Anhui Provincial Party Committee Holds Study Meeting on Chairman Mao's Writings Emphasizing Resolute Implementation of Chairman Mao's Instructions on Democratic Centralism

    It is imperative to view the implementation of democratic centralism from the height of world view, from the height of whether or not the party spirit is pure and strong, and from the height of whether or not one respects the masses, wholeheartedly serves the masses, respects practice, and adheres to dialectical materialism.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 20th) The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a study meeting on Chairman Mao's writings, emphasizing the need to earnestly study and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions on democratic centralism.

    The meeting held that Chairman Mao had given many important instructions on democratic centralism, which must be well studied and resolutely implemented. Democratic centralism is a fundamental issue in our Party's life. Whether or not we can adhere to democratic centralism is a matter related to whether or not the dictatorship of the proletariat can be consolidated and whether or not a socialist state can be built; it is a matter related to whether or not our Party can be consolidated and developed; it is also a matter related to whether or not the enthusiasm and creativity of the entire Party and all the people can be mobilized.

    The meeting considered that, based on the current situation and tasks, further adherence to democratic centralism is of even greater significance. At present, a new upsurge has emerged in the situation of industrial and agricultural production, and some people may be dizzy and complacent because of this excellent situation, self-righteous, only listening to good things and not listening to bad things, not proceeding from reality in their work, not following the mass line, not cherishing the strength of the people, and not paying attention to protecting the enthusiasm of the masses, etc. All of these deserve good vigilance. In light of this situation, it is now all the more necessary to revisit Chairman Mao's teachings on democratic centralism, to further improve democratic life within and outside the Party, and to implement a high degree of centralization on the basis of a high degree of democracy. Only in this way can we proceed from reality, pool our wisdom, and truly act in accordance with objective laws and the wishes of the broad masses; as long as a democratic atmosphere is formed, all kinds of opinions can be heard, and even if some problems occur in our work, they will not be difficult to discover or correct.

    The meeting pointed out that Anhui Province has the problem of frequent disasters and low yields in agriculture, and industry is still backward. To change the backward state of industrial and agricultural production, it is necessary to fully promote democracy, concentrate everyone's wisdom, mobilize all positive factors, unite as one, work hard, and promote the healthy development of the high tide of industrial and agricultural production and construction.

    Everyone believes that, at present, there are ideological problems and methodological problems in Anhui Province's implementation of democratic centralism, but the main problem is ideological. In the future, to further implement democratic centralism, we must start by improving understanding and solving ideological problems. It should be recognized that, as a leading cadre, whether or not one resolutely implements democratic centralism is a question of whether or not one has a solid proletarian world view. First of all, from the perspective of ideological consciousness, whether or not to implement democratic centralism is actually a question of whether or not one can get rid of the word "I" and achieve complete and thorough service to the people. That is, whether or not one can treat people equally, listen to the opinions of the masses, welcome criticism from others, and dare to uphold the truth and correct mistakes. Secondly, from the perspective of ideology, whether or not to implement democratic centralism is also a question of whether or not one can use the method of the mass line to better serve the people. The method of the mass line is to come from the masses and go to the masses; it is to first be a student of the masses and then be a teacher of the masses; it is to combine leadership with the masses and combine the general with the individual. Without understanding the method of the mass line, it is impossible to implement democratic centralism well.

    The meeting pointed out that it is imperative to view the implementation of democratic centralism from the height of world view, from the height of whether or not the party spirit is pure and strong, and from the height of whether or not one respects the masses, wholeheartedly serves the masses, respects practice, and adheres to dialectical materialism. It is necessary to earnestly transform our ideology and methodology in studying Chairman Mao's works, and to establish the implementation of democratic centralism on a solid ideological foundation.

    The meeting pointed out that, for leading cadres at all levels in Anhui Province at present, the primary issue is to develop a democratic style and respect the democratic rights of others. Even the opinions of a few people should be given importance. This is a major issue related to whether or not the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and people can be mobilized and whether or not the socialist revolution and socialist construction can be carried out well. Of course, it is also necessary to be good at centralization and to prevent decentralism. Only by fully implementing democratic centralism and implementing centralization on the basis of broad democracy can we truly achieve unified understanding and unified action.

    The meeting called on everyone to continuously study Chairman Mao's instructions on democratic centralism, continuously review and summarize experiences and lessons, and continuously study and solve problems in the implementation of democratic centralism. If this problem is solved well within the Party, it will not only be able to achieve correct leadership, but also create a political situation that is both centralized and democratic, both disciplined and free, and both has unified will and personal ease of mind, lively and vigorous.

    When discussing the current situation, the meeting focused on the issue of being "sober promoters." The meeting pointed out that leaders at all levels must take the lead in realizing revolutionization, must maintain a clear head in the face of the excellent situation, be sober promoters, and pay good attention to the following issues:

    First, it is necessary to repeatedly educate cadres and Party members to consciously adhere to the leadership method of the mass line. When something happens, it is necessary to consult with the masses, go to the masses to conduct investigation and research, summarize the fighting experience of the masses, proceed from reality in everything, and not act on subjective imagination; it is necessary to do solid work, mobilize the masses in a thorough and meticulous manner, and not just seek superficial excitement and engage in big booms; in leading production, it is necessary to fully promote democracy, and all production plans, especially agricultural production plans, must first be brewed and discussed from the bottom up, and then implemented from the top down after centralization; to promote new technologies or production measures, it is necessary to go through patient persuasion and typical demonstrations before gradually promoting them; if the masses are not willing to do something temporarily, it is necessary to continue to work and persuade the masses with facts, and not engage in coercion and commandism.

    Second, it is necessary to pay attention to using the method of grasping typical examples and setting up pacesetters to drive the general, and to improve the leadership work.

    Third, it is necessary to correctly combine the education of the masses with communist ideology and the resolute implementation of the current policies. Chairman Mao pointed out in "On New Democracy": We should expand the propaganda of communist ideology and intensify the study of Marxism-Leninism, but we should distinguish the propaganda of the ideological system and social system of communism from the practice of the current action program. This instruction is very important and we should keep it in mind. It is necessary to resolutely implement the Party's current policies, such as equivalent exchange, voluntary mutual benefit, distribution according to work, etc.

    Fourth, under the premise of giving prominence to politics, it is necessary to combine the solution of the ideological problems of the masses with the solution of the practical problems of the masses. Only after the masses have raised their class consciousness and changed their spiritual outlook can many of their practical problems be solved correctly. However, from the leadership's point of view, it is also necessary to actively care about the practical problems of the masses, take care of their material interests, and help them solve various difficulties in production and life. When the masses are enthusiastic and motivated, even more attention should be paid to this issue.

    The meeting emphasized that all work must give prominence to politics, use Mao Zedong Thought as the commander, study, lecture, and use Chairman Mao's works extensively; at the same time, it is imperative to truly implement giving prominence to politics, better grasp revolution and promote production, and grasp revolution and promote construction.

    The meeting also focused on discussing the issue of studying Chairman Mao's works by cadres at the county level and above.

### 安徽省委召开的学习毛主席著作会议强调  坚决执行毛主席关于民主集中制的指示

    安徽省委召开的学习毛主席著作会议强调
    坚决执行毛主席关于民主集中制的指示
    必须把执行民主集中制的问题，提到世界观的高度来看待，提到党性纯不纯、强不强的高度来看待，提到是不是尊重群众、一心为群众服务和尊重实践、坚持辩证唯物论的高度来看待。
    据新华社合肥二十日电　中共安徽省委最近召开的学习毛主席著作会议，强调要认真学习和坚决执行毛主席关于民主集中制的指示。
    会议认为，毛主席对民主集中制问题有过许多重要指示，必须很好学习和坚决执行。民主集中制是我们党的生活中一个根本性的问题。能不能坚持民主集中制，是关系到无产阶级专政能不能巩固，社会主义国家能不能建成的问题；是关系到我们党能不能巩固、能不能发展的问题；也是关系到能不能调动全党和全体人民的积极性和创造性的问题。
    会议认为，根据当前的形势和任务，进一步坚持民主集中制就更有重要的意义。目前，工农业生产形势出现了新的高涨，有些人可能被这种大好形势冲昏头脑而骄傲自满、自以为是，只听好的、不听坏的，办事不从实际出发，工作不走群众路线，不爱惜民力，不注意保护群众的积极性等等。这些都值得很好警惕。根据这种情况，当前就更有必要重温毛主席关于民主集中制的教导，进一步健全党内和党外的民主生活，在高度发扬民主的基础上，实行高度的集中。只有这样，才能从实际出发，集思广益，真正按照客观规律和广大群众的意愿办事；只要形成民主风气，各种意见都能听得进去，即使工作中出了一些问题，也不难发现，不难纠正。
    会议指出，安徽省在农业方面存在多灾低产的问题，工业也还是落后的。要改变工农业生产的落后面貌，就必须充分发扬民主，集中大家的智慧，调动一切积极因素，团结一致，艰苦奋斗，促使工农业生产建设高潮健康发展。
    大家认为，目前安徽省在执行民主集中制方面，有思想问题，也有方法问题，但主要的是思想问题。今后要进一步执行民主集中制，必须从提高认识解决思想问题着手。应该认识到，作为一个领导干部，是不是坚决执行民主集中制，是一个是不是具有牢固的无产阶级世界观的问题。首先，从思想意识上来看，是不是执行民主集中制，实际上是一个能不能摆脱“我”字，做到完全、彻底地为人民服务的问题。也就是能不能以平等的态度待人、倾听群众意见、欢迎别人批评的问题，能不能勇于坚持真理、改正错误的问题。其次，从思想方法上来看，是不是执行民主集中制，也是一个能不能按照群众路线的方法，做到更好地为人民服务的问题。群众路线的方法，就是从群众中来，到群众中去；就是先当群众的学生，再当群众的先生；就是领导与群众相结合，一般与个别相结合。不懂得群众路线的方法，就不可能执行好民主集中制。
    会议指出，必须把执行民主集中制的问题，提到世界观的高度来看待，提到党性纯不纯、强不强的高度来看待，提到是不是尊重群众、一心为群众服务和尊重实践、坚持辩证唯物论的高度来看待。必须在学习毛主席著作中，认真改造我们的思想意识和思想方法，把执行民主集中制建立在牢固的思想基础上。
    会议指出，对当前安徽省各级领导干部来说，首要的问题是要养成民主作风，尊重别人的民主权利。即使对少数人的意见，也要加以重视。这是关系到能否调动广大干部群众的积极性、搞好社会主义革命和社会主义建设的重大问题。当然，也要善于集中，要防止分散主义。只有全面贯彻民主集中制，在广泛民主的基础上实行集中，才能真正做到统一认识，统一行动。
    会议要求大家不断学习毛主席关于民主集中制的指示，不断回顾和总结经验教训，不断研究和解决执行民主集中制中的问题。党内把这个问题解决好了，不但能够实现正确的领导，而且能造成一个又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志、又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼那样一种政治局面。
    会议在讨论当前的形势时，着重谈到了要做“冷静的促进派”的问题。会议指出，各级领导必须带头实现革命化，必须在大好形势面前保持清醒的头脑，做冷静的促进派，很好地注意以下几个问题：
    一、要反复教育干部和党员自觉地坚持群众路线的领导方法。有事要同群众商量，要到群众中作调查研究，总结群众的斗争经验，一切从实际出发，不要凭主观想象办事；要扎扎实实地做工作，深入细致地发动群众，不要光图表面热闹，搞大轰大嗡；在领导生产中要充分发扬民主，各项生产计划特别是农业生产计划，一定要先自下而上地酝酿讨论，集中起来后再自上而下地贯彻下去；推行新技术或生产措施，要经过耐心说服，典型示范，再逐步推广；群众暂时还不愿办的，要继续做工作，用事实去说服群众，不能搞强迫命令。
    二、要注意用抓典型、树标兵的方法来带动一般，把领导工作提高一步。
    三、要把用共产主义思想教育群众和坚决执行当前的各项现行政策这两者正确地结合起来。毛主席在《新民主主义论》中就指出：应该扩大共产主义思想的宣传，加紧马克思列宁主义的学习，但是，应该把对于共产主义的思想体系和社会制度的宣传，同当前的行动纲领的实践区别开来。这个指示十分重要，我们应该很好记取。要坚决执行党的各项现行政策，例如等价交换、自愿互利、按劳分配等等。
    四、在突出政治的前提下，要把解决群众的思想问题和解决群众的实际问题这两者结合起来。群众只有在提高了阶级觉悟，改变了精神面貌后，他们的许多实际问题才能得到正确的解决。但是，从领导上来说，还要主动关心群众的实际问题，照顾他们的物质利益，帮助他们解决生产上、生活上的种种困难。在群众热情高、干劲大的情况下，更应加倍注意这个问题。
    会议强调指出：各项工作都要突出政治，用毛泽东思想挂帅，大学大讲大用毛主席著作；同时，一定要使突出政治真正落实下去，更好地抓革命促生产，抓革命促建设。
    会议还着重讨论了县以上干部学习毛主席著作问题。
