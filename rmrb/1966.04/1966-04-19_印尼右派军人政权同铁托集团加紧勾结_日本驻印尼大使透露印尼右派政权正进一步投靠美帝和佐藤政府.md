    Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, 18th: The Indonesian right-wing military group is intensifying its collusion with the Yugoslav Tito group.

    According to a report in the Yugoslav newspaper *Borba* on the 18th, Indonesian Foreign Minister Adam Malik recently told this newspaper's Jakarta correspondent that he wants to strengthen collusion with the Yugoslav Tito group.

    Malik said that the Indonesian "new government now hopes to strengthen and expand cooperation with other non-aligned countries, especially with Yugoslavia." He said that since the Indonesian right-wing military seized power, "the way has been opened for establishing closer and better relations (with Yugoslavia)." Malik also said that due to economic difficulties, Indonesia "must develop cooperation with international organizations, including various agencies of the United Nations."

    The Tito group is also stepping up its collusion with the Indonesian right-wing military group and is vigorously praising this group's frantic anti-communism and anti-people actions at home, and its reliance on US imperialism and opposition to China abroad, fully exposing its traitorous face as an accomplice of US imperialism. According to reports, Yugoslav Ambassador to Indonesia, Loncár, held talks in Jakarta on the 15th with Brigadier General Sharif Thayeb, the newly appointed Deputy Speaker of the Indonesian Cooperation Parliament, on Indonesia's "political development." During the talks, Loncár, on behalf of the Yugoslav government, expressed "sympathy and great concern for the current struggle" of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces.

    Prior to this, after the Indonesian right-wing generals group staged a "palace coup" on March 11, seizing power from Sukarno, the Yugoslav *Borba* openly supported Suharto, the head of the right-wing generals group, on March 15. The newspaper claimed that Suharto's "main purpose" in seizing power was to "defend the revolution and prevent it from being influenced by extremist tendencies," and praised the Indonesian "army for playing an unusually important role in leading this nation of 100 million people and this country in such an important strategic position." *Liberation* published a commentary on April 3 saying that the current situation in Indonesia is "encouraging." The commentary trumpeted that the right-wing generals group and all the counter-revolutionary forces in Indonesia should show "great tenacity and wisdom in order to bring about a complete transformation in all areas of domestic life." The *Courier* said on the same day that "Suharto's reorganization of the Presidium of the Cabinet and the Cabinet itself" and the "granting of authority over Indonesian foreign policy to Malik are of great significance," and "Indonesian foreign policy will be changed again."

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 18th: A statement made by Japanese Ambassador to Indonesia, Shizuo Saito, to Japanese reporters in Tokyo on the 15th indicates that the Indonesian right-wing military government will step up its reliance on US imperialism and collude with the Japanese Sato government. Saito was ordered to return to Japan on the 14th to report on his work.

    According to Japanese newspapers, Saito told reporters that the focus of the Indonesian right-wing military government's future foreign policy will be on "improving relations with the United States" and "expecting to receive assistance from the United States." Its current proclaimed "non-aligned policy" means "to be friendly with the United States." Saito said that the Indonesian right-wing military government has released the American missionaries who were arrested before the September 30th Movement, and that the American journalists who had once been deported have "almost all returned" to Indonesia.

    Saito said that Indonesian Foreign Minister Adam Malik was "very active" in Indonesia's return to the United Nations under US control and expressed his intention to "peacefully resolve" the dispute with "Malaysia."

    In discussing the relationship between Japan and Indonesia, Saito admitted that the Indonesian right-wing military group has requested Japan to provide "urgent economic cooperation" and hopes that Japan will act as a broker in order to obtain "assistance" from the United States and other Western countries.

    Saito also said that the Indonesian government "has made a 180-degree turn in its relationship with China."

    According to reports, the Sato government will, based on the information provided by Saito, support the Indonesian military government as much as possible in "improving relations with the United States," "handling the Malaysian dispute," and "rejoining the United Nations."

    印尼右派军人政权同铁托集团加紧勾结
    日本驻印尼大使透露印尼右派政权正进一步投靠美帝和佐藤政府
    新华社十八日讯　贝尔格莱德消息：印度尼西亚右派军人集团同南斯拉夫铁托集团正在加紧互相之间的勾结。
    据南斯拉夫《战斗报》十八日报道，印度尼西亚政府外交部长阿达姆·马利克最近对这家报纸驻雅加达的记者发表谈话，表示要加强同南斯拉夫铁托集团的勾结。
    马利克说，印度尼西亚“新政府现在希望加强和扩大同其他不结盟国家，特别是同南斯拉夫的合作”。他说，印度尼西亚右派军人夺取政权以后，“为建立（同南斯拉夫的）更密切的和更良好的关系开辟了道路”。马利克还说，由于经济困难，印度尼西亚“必须发展同国际组织，包括同联合国的各种机构的合作。”
    铁托集团方面也在加紧同印度尼西亚右派军人集团的勾结，并且大肆赞扬这个集团在国内疯狂反共、反人民，在国外投靠美帝国主义和反对中国的行径，充分暴露了它充当美帝国主义帮凶的叛徒嘴脸。据报道，南斯拉夫驻印度尼西亚大使朗查尔十五日在雅加达同新任印度尼西亚合作国会副议长沙里夫·塔耶卜准将就印度尼西亚的“政治发展”举行了会谈。在会谈中，朗查尔代表南斯拉夫政府对印度尼西亚右派反动势力“当前的斗争表示同情和极大的关怀”。
    在这之前，在印度尼西亚右派将领集团三月十一日演出“逼宫”丑剧，从苏加诺手里夺取政权以后，南斯拉夫的《战斗报》在三月十五日公然为右派将领集团头目苏哈托捧场。这家报纸说什么苏哈托夺权的“主要目的”是为了“保卫革命，不使革命受极端主义倾向的影响”，并且赞扬印度尼西亚“陆军在领导这个一亿人口的民族和这个处于如此重要的战略地位的国家方面起了异常重要的作用”。《解放报》四月三日发表评论说，目前的印度尼西亚局势“令人鼓舞”。评论鼓吹右派将领集团和印度尼西亚一切反革命势力要表现出“十分顽强和英明，以便使国内生活的各个领域来一个彻底的转变”。同一天的《信使报》说，“苏哈托改组政府主席团和内阁本身”以及让“马利克掌管印度尼西亚对外政策的权柄具有重要的意义”，“印度尼西亚外交政策将重新改变”。
    新华社十八日讯　东京消息：日本驻印度尼西亚大使斋藤镇男十五日在东京向日本记者发表的谈话表明，印度尼西亚右派军人政府将加紧投靠美帝国主义，并同日本佐藤政府相勾结。斋藤是十四日奉命回国述职的。
    据日本报纸报道，斋藤对记者们说，印度尼西亚右派军人政府今后的外交政策的重点将放在“改善同美国的关系上”，并且“期待得到美国的援助”。它目前所标榜的“不结盟政策”意味着“要同美国友好”。斋藤说，印度尼西亚右派军人政府已经释放了在九月三十日事件以前被逮捕的美国传教士，而且那些曾经一度被驱逐出境的美国记者“几乎都返回了”印度尼西亚。
    斋藤说，印度尼西亚外交部长阿达姆·马利克对印度尼西亚重返美国控制下的联合国表现“很积极”，并表示要“和平解决”同“马来西亚”的争端。
    在谈到日本同印度尼西亚的关系时，斋藤承认，印度尼西亚右派军人集团要求日本提供“紧急的经济合作”，并且希望日本充当掮客，以便得到美国和其他西方国家的“援助”。
    斋藤还说，印度尼西亚政府“对中国的关系已经来了一百八十度的大转弯”。
    据报道，佐藤政府将根据斋藤提供的情报，尽可能地支持印度尼西亚军人政府“改善同美国的关系”，“处理马来西亚纷争”和“重返联合国”的问题。
