    According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, April 14th: The Nanjing Radio Factory has summarized the following experience from the trial production and production of two types of popular three-transistor semiconductor radios: In serving the countryside, factory enterprises must emphasize politics in order to truly establish the thought of serving farmers, thereby producing products that are of good quality, low cost, and welcomed by the peasant masses.

    The factory recently began producing the B302 popular three-transistor semiconductor radio for rural areas in batches. This radio is about the size of a large steel lunch box, beautiful and elegant, and highly sensitive. It can not only directly receive programs from the Central People's Broadcasting Station, but also receive broadcasts from more than ten provincial and municipal radio stations. Its selectivity is also relatively good. Even if there are several high-power radio stations in one area, it will not produce noise, and the sound is loud and the sound quality is good. It also saves electricity. If you listen for three or four hours a day, four size 2 batteries can be used for about a month and a half. Some people familiar with radio performance believe that the quality of this three-transistor semiconductor radio has reached the level of some four-transistor and five-transistor semiconductor radios produced by some factories in China, but its price is much cheaper.

    As early as 1964, the factory leadership asked the designers to design a popular semiconductor radio loved by the broad masses of working people. At that time, the designers verbally accepted this task, but in their minds they thought: we must show "a high level" technically. They were enthusiastic about advanced technical indicators and small, exquisite, and beautiful appearance. Therefore, the trial-produced popular three-transistor semiconductor radio, due to high production costs, reaching fifty or sixty yuan per unit, excessive power consumption, and the restriction of listening effect due to its small size, was impractical and has never been produced in batches.

    Last year, during the Socialist Education Movement, workers made such criticisms to the designers: Why only design high-end semiconductor radios and not design popular, inexpensive, and high-quality radios for rural areas? Whom should we serve, a few or the majority? These sharp criticisms from the workers greatly shook the designers, forcing them to re-examine the question of whom to serve. They studied Chairman Mao's relevant works and relevant reports on serving the countryside and farmers in the newspapers, and their ideological understanding gradually improved. On the one hand, they clarified that it is necessary to design and produce high-end semiconductor radios, but it is more important to design and produce popular semiconductor radios that are suitable for the living standards of the broad masses of working people; on the other hand, they combined this with an examination of the purely technical viewpoint in their design thinking. They realized that without 500 million peasants in their minds, they could not design products that truly meet the needs of the peasants.

    To serve farmers, we must first understand their requirements. After the ideological awareness of the factory's more than thirty designers improved, they visited radio sales departments and some farmers in six groups in the urban and suburban areas of Nanjing, collecting farmers' requirements and opinions on radios. Through the visit, they learned that the general requirements of farmers were: the radio sound should be loud, preferably the radio should be placed in the field, and they can hear it while working in the field; they should be able to directly hear Beijing's broadcasts; the price should be cheap; the size does not matter, as long as there is a strap, it can be hung on the shoulder pole and carried in and out at any time. These opinions gave the designers a more specific direction for their efforts. So they analyzed and compared several popular semiconductor radios in China, and at the same time invited accountants to explain the cost composition factors of the products, clarified the main key to reducing costs, and also specifically understood the price and performance of each component. After several studies, it was decided to re-trial produce the three-transistor semiconductor radio.

    After the initial determination of the design plan, the factory published all the designed appearance and circuit diagrams and mobilized all the workers in the factory to put forward improvement suggestions. In this way, the popular three-transistor semiconductor radio, which is deeply welcomed by farmers for its good performance and low price, was finally born. With the approval of relevant leading departments, the Nanjing Radio Factory plans to allocate all of this type of radio produced this year to rural areas. Now the factory is seeking ways to further improve the performance of this radio and continue to reduce production costs.

    确立为农民服务的思想
    生产为农民欢迎的产品
    南京无线电厂制造适合农村的半导体收音机
    据新华社南京十四日电　南京无线电厂从两种普及型三管半导体收音机的试制和生产中，总结出这样一条经验：工厂企业在面向农村当中，只有突出政治，才能真正确立为农民服务的思想，从而生产出质量好、成本低、为农民群众欢迎的产品。
    这个厂最近开始为农村成批生产B302普及型三管半导体收音机，这种收音机的体积同大钢精饭盒相仿，美观大方，灵敏度高，不仅能直接收听中央人民广播电台的广播节目，而且能收听十多个省、市广播电台的广播。它的选择性也比较好，即使一个地区有几个强电力的电台，也不会产生杂音，声音响，音质好。用电也比较省，如果每天收听三四小时，四节二号电池可用一个半月左右。有些熟悉收音机性能的人认为，这种三管半导体收音机的质量已经达到目前国内有些厂生产的四管五管半导体收音机的水平，而它的价格却要便宜得多。
    早在一九六四年，这个厂领导要求设计人员设计一种广大劳动人民喜爱的普及型半导体收音机。当时，设计人员口头上接受了这项任务，脑子里却想的是：一定要在技术上表现出“有水平”。他们热中于先进的技术指标和小巧玲珑、精致美观的外形。因此，试制出来的普及型三管半导体收音机，由于生产成本高，每台达五六十元，用电太费，以及因为体积小而限制了收听效果，不切实用，便一直没有成批生产。
    去年在社会主义教育运动中，职工们纷纷向设计人员提出了这样的批评：为什么只设计高档的半导体收音机，而不设计面向农村价廉物美的普及型收音机？究竟应该为谁服务，是为少数人服务，还是为多数人服务？职工们的这些尖锐的批评，在设计人员中大为震动，迫使他们重新认识为谁服务这个问题。他们学习了毛主席的有关著作和报纸上面向农村为农民服务的有关报道，思想认识逐步提高。一方面明确了设计生产高级半导体收音机是必要的，但是更重要的是设计生产适应广大劳动人民生活水平的普及型半导体收音机；一方面结合检查了设计思想上的纯技术观点。他们认识到脑子里没有五亿农民，就设计不出真正符合农民需要的产品。
    为农民服务，首先就要了解农民的要求。这个工厂的三十多个设计人员在思想觉悟提高之后，分六路访问了南京市区、郊区销售收音机的门市部和部分农民，搜集农民对收音机的要求和意见。经过访问，了解到农民的普遍要求是：收音机声音要响，最好是收音机放在田头，在田间劳动也能听到；能直接听到北京的广播；价格要便宜；体积大小无所谓，只要有一根带子，可以挂在扁担头上，随时带出带进就行了。这些意见使设计人员们有了更加具体的努力方向。于是他们便把国内的几种普及型半导体收音机进行分析比较，同时邀请会计师讲解产品成本构成因素，明确降低成本的主要关键，还专门了解了每种元件的价格和性能。经过几番研究，确定重新试制三管半导体收音机。
    当设计方案初步确定后，工厂又将设计的外形、线路图全部公布出来，发动全厂职工提出改进意见。就这样，深受农民欢迎的性能好、价钱低的普及型三管半导体收音机终于诞生了。经过有关领导部门同意，南京无线电厂今年计划生产的这种收音机，将全部分配给农村。现在这个工厂正在寻求进一步提高这种收音机的性能、继续降低生产成本的途径。
