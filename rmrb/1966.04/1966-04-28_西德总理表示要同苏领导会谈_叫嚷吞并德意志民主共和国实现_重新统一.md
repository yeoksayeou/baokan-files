    (Xinhua News Agency, West Berlin, April 27) West German Chancellor Erhard, while refusing to recognize the German Democratic Republic and clamoring for "reunifying Germany," stated on the 25th that he was "interested" in holding talks with the Soviet Union.
    Erhard made these remarks at a press conference in West Berlin. At the meeting, Erhard blatantly threatened to achieve "reunification" with the aim of annexing the German Democratic Republic. He said that "reunification cannot be forgotten" and that "hope must be turned into reality." While advocating for an "active" German policy that could not wait for a long time, he resolutely refused to negotiate with the German Democratic Republic and opposed any actions that smacked of recognition of the German Democratic Republic. Erhard said, "Germany (referring to West Germany) is interested in holding talks with the Soviet Union," and "the invitation to Kosygin to visit Bonn remains valid. He can come whenever he wants." Regarding the planned mutual dispatch of speakers between the Socialist Unity Party of the German Democratic Republic and the Social Democratic Party of West Germany to deliver speeches in cities of the two countries, Erhard expressed "satisfaction." The West German government had stated that the purpose of such "party and individual debates" could only be to serve West Germany's policy of "reunifying" Germany.

    西德总理表示要同苏领导会谈
    叫嚷吞并德意志民主共和国实现“重新统一”
    据新华社二十七日讯　西柏林消息：西德总理艾哈德二十五日在拒不承认德意志民主共和国，并且叫嚷要“重新统一德国”的同时，表示“有兴趣”同苏联进行会谈。
    艾哈德是在西柏林的一次记者招待会上谈到这些问题的。艾哈德在会上露骨地威胁要实现以吞并德意志民主共和国为目的的“重新统一”。他说“不能忘记重新统一”，必须把“希望变成现实”。他一面鼓吹要推行一项“积极的”德国政策，不能长期地等待下去；一面又表示坚决拒绝同德意志民主共和国进行谈判，反对任何有承认德意志民主共和国的味道的行动。艾哈德说：“德国（指西德）感兴趣的是同苏联会谈”，“向柯西金发出的访问波恩的邀请继续有效。他想哪一天来就哪一天来。”对于计划中的德意志民主共和国的统一社会党同西德的社会民主党相互派人在两国城市中发表演讲的计划，艾哈德表示“满意”。西德政府曾经声明，进行这种“政党和个人辩论”的目的只能是为西德“重新统一”德国的政策服务。
