    New China News Agency, Washington, April 20th: While the U.S. continues to increase troops in South Vietnam and brazenly uses B-52 type aircraft to bomb North Vietnam, and expands the bombing range of U.S. bandit aircraft to the suburbs of Hanoi and Haiphong, the Johnson administration and leading figures in Congress are again playing the "peace talks" conspiracy, attempting to use a two-pronged approach of increasing "military pressure" and waving an olive branch to force the Vietnamese people to submit.
    Washington's latest "peace feeler" was proposed by Senate Democratic leader Mansfield. Mansfield emphasized in the Senate on the 18th that a "just resolution" of the Vietnam War is "beneficial to the United States," and the United States "should more vigorously seek negotiations." He said, "It may be feasible for us to directly face-to-face at a peace table with Hanoi, Beijing, and those factors in South Vietnam that are essential to achieving and maintaining a peaceful settlement in that region," and "the best place to set up this peace table would be Japan or Burma" or some other place in Asia.
    Mansfield's speech immediately received support from the White House. After meeting with Johnson, U.S. Representative to the United Nations Goldberg told reporters on the 19th that the President welcomed Mansfield's suggestion. Goldberg also said that since taking office at the United Nations, Johnson has entrusted him with using any means to promote the "cause of peace talks." This includes not only working through the United Nations, but also exploring what each member state of the United Nations can do to help start peace talks. Goldberg said that Japan sent an envoy to Moscow for this purpose, and the United States welcomes this move. In a television program in New York on the 17th, Goldberg also advocated for the United States to further use the United Nations to interfere in Vietnamese affairs, making the United Nations a "police force in Vietnam." He said: "We have not reached this point yet, but...we are continuing to work towards reaching this point."
    State Department spokesman McCloskey also welcomed and agreed with Mansfield's suggestion on the 19th, and said that the United States "would further welcome any initiative proposed by Asia to achieve discussions."
    However, while the Johnson administration is talking extensively about a "peaceful resolution" of the Vietnam issue, it continues to emphasize that the United States will never withdraw its invading troops from South Vietnam and will never recognize the South Vietnam National Liberation Front as the sole legitimate representative of the South Vietnamese people. This exposes the U.S. "peace talks" conspiracy, which is nothing more than a cover for its plot to expand the war.

    约翰逊政府又为“和谈”骗局死胎招魂
    曼斯菲尔德鼓吹美国同越中两国举行面对面会谈  戈德堡和美国务院齐声叫喊同意曼斯菲尔德建议
    新华社二十日讯　华盛顿消息：在美国继续增兵南越并且悍然使用B—52型飞机轰炸越南北方和把美国强盗飞机的轰炸范围扩大到河内及海防市郊的时候，约翰逊政府和国会的头面人物又在玩弄“和谈”骗局，妄图用增加“军事压力”和摇晃橄榄枝双管齐下的办法来迫使越南人民屈服。
    华盛顿最新的“和平试探”是由参议院民主党领袖曼斯菲尔德提出的。曼斯菲尔德十八日在参议院强调说，越南战争的“公正解决”对“美国是有利的”，美国“应当更有力地谋求谈判”。他说，“我们同河内、北京以及南越的那些为实现和保持那个地区的和平解决必不可少的因素在一张和平桌上直接地面对面会谈也许是可行的”，“设置这种和平桌的地方最好不过的是日本或缅甸”或亚洲某个其他地方。
    曼斯菲尔德的讲话立即得到白宫的支持。在同约翰逊举行会谈后，美国驻联合国代表戈德堡十九日对新闻记者说，总统欢迎曼斯菲尔德的建议。戈德堡还说，自从他担任联合国职务以来，约翰逊就委托他用任何手段来促进“和谈事业”。这包括不仅通过联合国来进行工作，而且还要探讨每一个联合国会员国能做些什么来帮助和谈开始。戈德堡说，日本为此派了一个使者到莫斯科去，美国欢迎此举。戈德堡十七日在纽约的电视节目中还鼓吹美国进一步利用联合国来干涉越南事务，使联合国成为“越南的警察部队”。他说：“我们还没有达到这一点，但是……我们在继续致力于达到这一点。”
    国务院发言人麦克洛斯基十九日也表示欢迎和同意曼斯菲尔德的建议，并且说什么美国“将进一步欢迎亚洲为实现讨论所提出的任何倡议”。
    但是，约翰逊政府在大谈越南问题“和平解决”的时候，继续强调美国决不从南越撤走它的侵略军，决不承认越南南方民族解放阵线是南越人民唯一的合法代表。这就揭穿了美国的“和谈”骗局，不过是一个掩盖它扩大战争的阴谋。
