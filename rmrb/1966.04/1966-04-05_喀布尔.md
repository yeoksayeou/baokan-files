    Kabul
    Kabul is the capital of Afghanistan. It is located in eastern Afghanistan, on the southern slopes of the Hindu Kush mountains. It is a beautiful plateau city surrounded by mountains on all sides, with an altitude of approximately 2,000 meters. The Kabul River runs through the city, with the old city on the south bank and the new city on the north bank. The city covers an area of approximately 18 square kilometers and has a population of approximately 380,000.
    Kabul is a heroic city with a long history. Here, the Afghan people have repelled enemy invasions several times. Afghanistan has fought three wars against British aggressors in its history. In the Third Anglo-Afghan War of 1919, more than 20,000 British invading troops were completely annihilated in Kabul. To this day, the Maiwand Victory Monument and the Independence Monument in Kabul stand as glorious symbols of the Afghan people's heroic struggle against British aggressors.
    The word "Kabul" originally meant "trade center." In ancient times, it was one of the important cities along the famous "Silk Road" that traversed East Asia and West Asia, extending as far as Europe. The "Book of Han" written by the Chinese Han Dynasty historian Ban Gu mentions Gao Fu, which is today's Kabul. Now, Kabul has become the commercial and transportation hub of Afghanistan with a new look. It has several highways leading to all parts of the country and neighboring countries such as Pakistan and Iran, and it also has several air routes connecting with neighboring countries.
    With the development in recent years, Kabul has factories and enterprises such as textile, wool textile, cement, matches, soap, leather, marble, porcelain, and woodworking, as well as a bread joint factory and a power station. Afghanistan's highest institution of higher learning, Kabul University, is located here. The National Museum of Kabul displays ancient stone tools, bronze age artifacts, as well as Buddhist and Islamic relics, which show the splendid ancient culture of Afghanistan.

    喀布尔
    喀布尔是阿富汗的首都。它位于阿富汗东部，在兴都库什山南麓，是一个四面环山，海拔约两千米的美丽的高原城市。喀布尔河纵贯全市，河的南岸是旧城，北岸是新城。全市面积约十八平方公里，人口约三十八万。
    喀布尔是一个具有悠久历史的英雄城市，在这里，阿富汗人民曾经数次打退了敌人的侵略。阿富汗历史上有过三次抗击英国侵略者的战争，在一九一九年的第三次抗英战争中，英国侵略军二万多人在喀布尔全部被歼。至今，喀布尔市内耸立的梅旺德战役纪念碑和独立纪念碑，都是阿富汗人民英勇奋击英国侵略者的光荣标志。
    “喀布尔”这个字的本意是“贸易中心”。在古代，它就是著名的横贯东亚和西亚远达欧洲的“丝绸之路”所经过的重要城市之一。中国汉代历史学家班固所著的《汉书》提到高附，它就是今天的喀布尔。现在，喀布尔更以崭新的面貌，成为阿富汗全国的商业和交通的枢纽。它有好几条公路通往全国各地和巴基斯坦、伊朗等各邻国，还拥有几条与邻国相通的航空线。
    随着近年来的发展，喀布尔拥有纺织、毛纺、水泥、火柴、肥皂、制革、大理石、瓷器、木器等工厂企业以及面包联合工厂和发电站，这里有阿富汗最高学府——喀布尔大学。在喀布尔的国家博物馆里，陈列有远古石器、铜器时代以及佛教和伊斯兰教的遗物，它们表明了阿富汗古代的灿烂文化。（新华社）（附图片）
