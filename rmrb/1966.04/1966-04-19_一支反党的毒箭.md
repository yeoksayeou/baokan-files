    A Poisonous Arrow Against the Party
    Liu Jinchao, Worker of Yutian Agricultural Machinery Repair Factory, Hebei
    I am a worker. I was illiterate in the past. Under the cultivation of the Party, I have become educated and often write small operas. I write about both ancient and modern people. I wrote "Clever Luban" to encourage everyone to use their brains more in technology; I wrote "Apprentice Blood and Tears" to conduct class education for young workers; I also wrote "Old Man Studies Mao's Selected Works in His Old Age," praising good people and good deeds who adhere to putting politics in command and doing a good job in production. In a word, they are all written to promote the socialist revolution and construction.
    Literature and art are originally important weapons of class struggle. We wield them to engage in revolution, and counter-revolutionaries wield them to engage in counter-revolution. However, Comrade Wu Han, in his "self-criticism," actually said that his writing of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was "for the sake of the ancient, for the sake of writing a play." This is deliberately playing dumb. In fact, Comrade Wu Han had long ago loudly and clearly shouted: When writing ancient plays, you must choose themes with practical significance! You must closely integrate with current needs! You must inspire people today! It can be seen that Comrade Wu Han's writing of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was closely integrated with current needs, but what he closely integrated with was the needs of right-leaning opportunists.
    "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was written in 1960, which was after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. The Party "dismissed" the "officials" of the right-leaning opportunists. This was originally a great happy event for the people of the whole country, but Wu Han, standing on the position of right-leaning opportunists, hated the Party to the bone. In "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," he borrowed the soul of Hai Rui, exhausted his ability to fabricate, and beautified those right-leaning opportunists into "benefactors" who "sought benefits for the people," "eliminated harm for the people," and "were loved by the people." He greatly encouraged the right-leaning opportunists, using Hai Rui's words to cheer them on, saying: "The unyielding spirit remains in old age, how can one bow down to flatter powerful ministers?" He hoped that the right-leaning opportunists would not be intimidated by failure and would try again after failing.
    "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is a poisonous arrow that Comrade Wu Han used to attack the Party and socialism. We must counterattack it. Chairman Mao said: "The intellectuals who harbor hostile feelings towards our country are a very small minority. These people do not like our proletarian dictatorship, they are nostalgic for the old society. Given the opportunity, they will stir up trouble, wanting to overthrow the Communist Party and restore the old China." In the current hot three great revolutionary struggles, "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is a very good negative teaching material for us. It reminds us that the bourgeoisie is using various tricks to compete with us for power, and we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and carry the revolution through to the end.

    一支反党的毒箭
    河北玉田农机修理厂工人　刘晋朝
    我是一个工人，过去一字不识，在党的培养下我有了文化，也常写个小戏什么的。古人、今人都写。我写过《巧鲁班》，为的是让大伙在技术上多动脑筋；写过《徒工血泪》，为的是向青工们进行阶级教育；还写过《老来红学毛选》，表扬了坚持政治挂帅搞好生产的好人好事。一句话，都是为了推动社会主义革命和建设才写的。
    文艺本来就是阶级斗争的重要武器，我们握着它搞革命，反革命握着它搞反革命。可是吴晗同志在作“自我批评”时竟说他写《海瑞罢官》是“为古而古，为写戏而写戏”。这是故意装糊涂。其实，吴晗同志早就一字一板地高声大喊过：写古戏必须挑选有现实意义的题材！必须密切结合当前的需要！必须对今人有启发作用！可见，吴晗同志写《海瑞罢官》是密切结合当前的需要的，不过他密切结合的是右倾机会主义分子的需要。
    《海瑞罢官》写在一九六○年，那是在党的八届八中全会以后，党“罢”了右倾机会主义分子的“官”。这本来是全国人民的大喜事，可是，站在右倾机会主义分子立场上的吴晗，却对党恨之入骨。他在《海瑞罢官》里假借海瑞之魂，尽其捏造之能事，把那些右倾机会主义分子，美化成为“为民谋利”、“为民除害”“受民爱戴”的“救星”。他对右倾机会主义分子，大加鼓励，借海瑞之口，给他们打气说：“老来傲骨犹然在，岂肯折腰媚权臣。”希望右倾机会主义分子不为失败所吓倒，失败了再干。
    《海瑞罢官》是吴晗同志向党向社会主义进攻的毒箭。我们必须予以还击。毛主席说过：“对于我们的国家抱着敌对情绪的知识分子，是极少数。这种人不喜欢我们这个无产阶级专政的国家，他们留恋旧社会。一遇机会，他们就会兴风作浪，想要推翻共产党，恢复旧中国。”在眼下火热的三大革命斗争中，《海瑞罢官》对我们是很好的反面教材。它提醒我们，资产阶级正在使着这样、那样的花招，和我们争夺印把子，我们必须更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，将革命进行到底。
