Edition: 5

    Editor's Note: This newspaper published materials on April 10 entitled "Comrade Wu Han's Anti-Party, Anti-Socialist, and Anti-Marxist Political Thought and Academic Views," which exposed Comrade Wu Han's reactionary remarks after the national liberation. Now, we are publishing below the main public statements made by Comrade Wu Han before the national liberation, as compiled by Comrades Wang Zhengping, Ding Weizhi, and others.

    It is well known that in the 1930s, Comrade Wu Han frequented the circles of Hu Shi, Jiang Tingfu, and Fu Sinian, becoming a specimen they meticulously cultivated.

    What kind of person was Comrade Wu Han before liberation? From this material, everyone can see that he stood on the side of pro-Chiang, pro-America, and anti-communist positions, a person who single-mindedly wanted to take the third road, namely the road of bourgeois dictatorship. What Comrade Wu Han wrote down in black and white will enlighten many people.

    We hope everyone will read this material carefully, which will help everyone understand that Comrade Wu Han's path to anti-Party and anti-socialist positions in the 1960s was not accidental. At the same time, this material will help everyone further expose and criticize Comrade Wu Han's reactionary stance and thought.

    Attacking the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement, Serving Chiang Kai-shek's Policy of Non-Resistance

    A Loyal Follower and Active Propagandist of Hu Shi's Reactionary Ideas

    According to Wu Han himself, he wrote his first essay, "The Economic Situation of the Western Han Dynasty," in Hu Shi's culture class at China Public School in 1930. This article was highly appreciated by Hu Shi. He also said that because Hu Shi left the school, he felt it was "boring" to continue studying there, so he ran to Beiping. Relying on Hu Shi's connections, he was admitted to Tsinghua University in 1931, and the department head, Jiang Tingfu, gave him special "work-study" privileges. Under the deliberate training and support of Hu Shi, Jiang Tingfu, and others, Wu Han embarked on the road of "scholarship." ① Hu Shi once instructed him in a letter to "train yourself to be a scholar capable of organizing Ming Dynasty historical materials," to "make a big deal out of a small subject," and to be "down-to-earth," etc. In his reply, Wu Han praised Hu Shi's guidance in a sickening manner as "a celestial star." He said: "Thanks to the teacher's kindness, I was admitted to Tsinghua, and in the blink of an eye, it has been three weeks. After reading the teacher's instructions last time, I felt as if I was alone in the dark night in the boundless wilderness, and suddenly I got a celestial star, and the light shone, and all directions were open." Last week, I asked someone to buy a copy of the Chongwen edition of the History of the Ming Dynasty, and I read it every day...preparing to finish reading the History of the Ming Dynasty first, and then do it step by step according to the teacher's instructions." ②

    From the "September 18th Incident" onwards, Japanese imperialism launched a large-scale invasion of China, and the Chinese nation faced a critical moment of life and death, while Chiang Kai-shek was implementing a traitorous policy of non-resistance. At this time, Hu Shi and others, adapting to the political needs of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionaries, vigorously promoted "sorting out the national heritage," wanting young people to ignore the national crisis and bury themselves in "scholarship."

    Wu Han at that time was a loyal follower and active propagandist of Hu Shi's reactionary ideas. Under Hu Shi's specific guidance, he wrote an article entitled "Hu Yinglin's Chronological Biography," in which he spared no effort to praise Hu Yinglin, a Ming Dynasty scholar, for his spirit of delving into old papers, writing books behind closed doors, and "competing with bookworms and vinegar flies in rat holes," and praised Hu Yinglin for "keenly forming his own theory," "worldly affairs are not worth his brow and heart," and "right and wrong, he ignores everything." ③

    Wu Han himself also practiced what he preached, hiding in the library and devoting himself to tedious and boring textual research. From the end of 1931 to 1932, he wrote three articles on the textual research of "Queen Mother of the West" in one breath, citing extensively, researching the appearance, marriage, children, clothing, and even "Queen Mother of the West hairpin," "Queen Mother of the West mat," "Queen Mother of the West jujube," and "Queen Mother of the West peach" in the legend; he researched that "Queen Mother of the West" had at least "twenty-four daughters, twenty-four sons-in-law, and hundreds of grandchildren." ④

    Wu Han also actively participated in the "academic discussion" of the "Research on the Birth Mother of Ming Chengzu" initiated by Fu Sinian, writing long articles to prove that Chengzu was not born of the Empress Gao but of Concubine Gong. ⑤

    In 1934, Wu Han wrote "Research on the Hu Weiyong Party Case." This is the article that Wu Han enthusiastically recommended to people when right-leaning opportunists stirred up a "reversal of verdicts" in 1962. In that article, he said that the "Hu case" and the subsequent major cases were all due to Zhu Yuanzhang's distrust of "meritorious officials and veterans" and "skillfully fabricated" by "him and his secretaries." He also said that the "Hu Weiyong Party Case" "contains great significance, and its influence extends to the entire Ming Dynasty." ⑥

    Scolding the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement as "for show," "to appear fashionable," "a swarm of bees," and "scattering like birds and beasts"

    The artillery fire of the "September 18th Incident" and the "January 28th Incident" aroused the infinite anger of the people of the whole country. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, students in various places launched a vigorous anti-Japanese national salvation movement, and the slogans "Down with Japanese Imperialism" and "Down with the Traitorous Kuomintang Government" resounded throughout the large and small cities, and patriotic slogans and leaflets were posted all over the streets. All of this not only did not move Wu Han, who was buried in old papers and determined to be a scholar and professor, but instead invited his vicious cold ridicule and abuse.

    In March 1932, he published an article under the pseudonym You Sheng in the "Tsinghua Weekly," ⑦ slandering the student's national salvation movement as "for show," "to appear fashionable," to "show off in society," and to pretend to be "patriotic." He satirized the patriotic students' gatherings, parades, demonstrations, petitions, and organization of volunteer armies as "a set of formulas," and "three weeks later," they still "go to class, sleep, and eat," "pick up reference books to prepare for the big exam," and still use "glossy paper" instead of domestic paper to write.

    He used extremely vicious words to scold the petitioning students, who went as "a swarm of bees" and returned "scattering like birds and beasts"; ridiculed the petition on foot as "pilgrimage to Miaofeng Mountain," and the petition to the south took the "national train," "without having to pay out of their own pockets." He asked the students who declared a hunger strike fiercely: "If you really starve to death, who will come to speak for you?"

    Like father, like son. Wu Han's great work "Past Events" was no less than Hu Shi's "Patriotic Movement and Studying" ⑧ published in 1925. In that year, Hu Shi slandered the "popular sentiment" in the May 30th Movement as "five minutes of heat" and satirized the young people who participated in the patriotic movement for running out of the classroom because they "couldn't resist" others' "temptation and ridicule." Wu Han's cold ridicule and abuse completely inherited Hu Shi's set of mantle.

    Planning for the "Long-Term Peace and Stability" of the Kuomintang's Reactionary Rule

    Saying that "scholars" are loyal to their masters, Chiang Kai-shek should improve the status of "scholars" and give play to the role of "scholars"

    Around 1943, Wu Han felt that he had been a professor for several years and had squeezed into the ranks of "scholars," and should "study well and then become an official," so he talked a lot about the important role of "scholars" in politics, so as to recommend himself to the Chiang Kai-shek group and get an official position.

    In 1943, Wu Han published "Speaking of Scholars," desperately promoting the role of "scholars" in history. He said: "In the Spring and Autumn Period, the pyramid-shaped ruling class, the class below the king, princes, and doctors was scholars, and compared with the class above scholars, the number was the largest and the power was the greatest. Below them were commoners and slaves, who were laborers and villains." "Scholars are between the upper and lower classes, receiving special education, and are civil officials in peacetime and the main force in war in wartime. As far as the upper aristocratic class is concerned, it is the only driving force to maintain the right to rule."

    Wu Han used ancient examples to imply the present, expressing to the ruling Kuomintang reactionaries that "scholars," including himself, are absolutely loyal to their masters. He said: "Scholars have special tasks in politics and society, and enjoy the privilege of education alone among the four classes," "not only receive special education and training, but also receive special spiritual training." "Under these two kinds of training, they have cultivated their moral concept--loyalty." He also said: "In the feudal era, countries stood side by side, and the life of scholars was maintained by the fields and land given by his master, princes or doctors. Due to this economic relationship, scholars can only be loyal to their masters." After the Qin and Han dynasties, "scholars belonged directly to the monarch and the state." "After the division of scholars into civil and military, the moral concept remained unchanged. For thousands of years, civil and military scholars have fought, shed blood, and sacrificed for the country and the nation, unyielding, advancing one after another, and their tragic and brave deeds are endless in history."

    Wu Han especially reminded the rulers at that time to pay attention to such "historical lessons": "If the king, princes, and doctors cannot get the support of scholars, not only will the regime collapse immediately, but they will not be able to protect themselves."

    After talking about "historical lessons," Wu Han turned to directly offer advice to Chiang Kai-shek, making the words clear. He said: "The education and training of scholars in ancient times should be valued, especially the cultivation of moral concepts--the spirit of being responsible to the country (Editor's note: Of course, it is the country of the Kuomintang fascist dictatorship) and the nation." "To improve the social status of scholars, we must attach importance to both civil and military affairs, and the political level and social status must be improved. This is the task that the whole country should devote itself to in the future." ⑨

    In 1943, in the book "Ming Taizu," Wu Han once again told the rulers about the importance of "intellectuals." He said: "Zhu Yuanzhang attached special importance to intellectuals, humbly listened to their advice, and completed his own education. Every time he conquered a place, he would visit and seek out local talents and recruit them into his own mansion." Wu Han also listed some examples of how "mansion talents" offered advice to Zhu Yuanzhang, thus laying the foundation for Zhu Yuanzhang's later imperial career. ⑩

    Wu Han's self-recommendation did not seem to attract enough attention from the rulers at that time. This made him greatly disappointed, so he wrote an article entitled "Life and Thought" in July 1944 to vent his grievances. He said that "middle-aged people," including himself, who are not "powerful and wealthy," have "lost confidence" and formed "a kind of doomsday worldview," and "have broken their hearts and given up the dream of catching up." Saying "broken their hearts" is a pretense, in fact, they still want to "catch up," so at the end of this article, he shouted: This state of "middle-aged people" "is a hidden worry of the 'country'!" According to him, the "only way" to solve this "hidden worry" is to arrange a "way out" for these frustrated "middle-aged people," and "prepare a bicycle"! ? (Note: The so-called "bicycle" means "an official position.")

    Concealing the Kuomintang's Corruption Crimes, Nonsensically Saying that the Root of Corruption is Due to "Family as the Standard"

    In 1943, just as Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary regime was extremely corrupt, Wu Han wrote articles such as "On Corruption" and "A Chapter in the History of Corruption" to exonerate the Kuomintang for its rampant corruption. In these articles, he used the viewpoint of bourgeois sociology to attribute the root of the old society's corruption to what "social education," "social environment," "political environment," etc., avoiding the fundamental issue of the social system.

    Wu Han described the emperor's corruption in history as an occasional phenomenon. He said: "In the past history, the emperor was the head of state, and the emperor's court finance and the state finance have always been separated, but sometimes the emperor was confused and wasteful, indistinguishable between public and private, regarding domestic products as private property, and squandered them at will, causing the people to be poor and the finances exhausted. This situation is endless in history. The most amazing thing is that the emperor also has corruption."

    He said: "The politicians of the past dynasties have exhausted their efforts to try to eliminate corruption and establish a clean and honest officialdom. There are only two ways, the first is a generous salary..., the second is severe punishment." Wu Han believes that "generous salary" and "severe punishment" "have considerable effects temporarily, but neither can last long." "The reason is that these two methods can only treat the symptoms, and cannot affect the root cause of corruption. The only way to cure the root cause is to understand from the entire history and social organization."

    How to understand from the entire history and social organization? Wu Han's explanation is: "Until today, our social organization and our culture are based on the family." "Once you get on the road to success, fathers, wives, daughters, relatives, or old friends and villagers will flock to you. A thin salary cannot support them, and even a generous salary cannot fully cope with them. What's more, you have to welcome and entertain your superiors, and you need money everywhere! If you don't get corrupted, you will either starve to death or be ashamed to death!"

    Wu Han said: "According to this understanding, the root of corruption, the way to cure the root cause, should be to liberate 'people' from the shackles of the family. The independence of personal life, everyone lives for work, there is no dependence between people." "After 'people' can exist independently, the income from work is enough to live on, the sanctions of the law make him unwilling to commit crimes, generous salary and severe punishment are used alternately, there is open public opinion guidance and supervision in society, and there are strong supervisory agencies in the government to impeach and correct, 'if people are well-fed, they will know honor and disgrace,' and the elimination of corruption is of course assured."

    In 1943, just as the Kuomintang-controlled areas were suffering from inflation and the Chiang Kai-shek group was struggling to cope, Wu Han "broke out of the door" and studied financial issues, writing "Record of the Great Ming Circulating Treasure Notes," talking about the advantages and disadvantages of the paper money laws of the Ming Dynasty, and various measures to prevent currency depreciation, indicating that he had a lot of research on this issue.

    Obviously, Wu Han was keen on "discussing corruption" and "discussing treasure notes" at that time, all in order to attract the attention of the Kuomintang authorities and win the favor of the reactionary rulers.

    Following Chiang Kai-shek, Praising Zhu Yuanzhang; Through Zhu Yuanzhang, Praising Chiang Kai-shek

    In March 1940, Chiang Kai-shek personally came forward and wrote a preface to Fang Juehui's "Record of Ming Taizu's Revolutionary Military Achievements." In this preface, Chiang Kai-shek greatly praised Zhu Yuanzhang, saying that "Mingzu rose from the grass, determined to restore the country, recruited heroes, and cut down the heroes, and in fifteen years, he completed the great cause of restoring China." He especially praised Zhu Yuanzhang's achievements in "militarily pacifying the turmoil and politically achieving peace," "suppressing rebellions and pacifying the barbarians and befriending the remote areas," and the means of "combining leniency and severity, and combining power and virtue." He said that Zhu Yuanzhang's these things "not only provide reference for historical studies," but also can "borrow for the construction of the country."

    As soon as the imperial decree came out, Wu Han was busy, and he immediately picked up his pen to "respond to the emperor." In September 1940, he wrote "Record of Ming Shilu," and in April 1941, he published "Mingjiao and the Ming Empire." On this basis, Wu Han wrote the book "Ming Taizu" in 1943. This book was one of a set of series edited by Pan Gongzhan, then Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department of the Kuomintang and Director of the Central Book and Magazine Review Committee. Pan Gongzhan also wrote "Editing Purpose" for this set of series. He explained that the publication of this set of series "has only one purpose, that is, to contribute to the construction of a cultural avenue for the construction of the country and build a small cornerstone." He said that the "first series" included in this set of series is "national great men," that is, "those who have great virtue to the world and will always be worshiped by the people of the country." Wu Han's "Ming Taizu" was written in accordance with Pan Gongzhan's specifications, using a "worship" tone.

    In the book "Ming Taizu," Wu Han fully implemented and specifically elaborated on Chiang Kai-shek's comments on Zhu Yuanzhang. Wu Han followed Chiang Kai-shek step by step, praising Zhu Yuanzhang's civil and military achievements, praising him for "pacifying the heroes" and "building the country with bare hands"; praising his successful "Northern Expedition," making the Chinese nation "not only saved but also revived"; praising his set of political measures after the founding of the country, saying that the "Great Ming Law" is "the most important and greatest code in the entire history of legislation," and even praising the "lijia system" promoted by Zhu Yuanzhang to rule the people as "a good way to guide farmers to cooperate."

    Chiang Kai-shek especially praised Zhu Yuanzhang's reactionary "two hands" of "combining leniency and severity and combining power and virtue." Parroting, Wu Han also followed Chiang Kai-shek and praised Zhu Yuanzhang's ruling methods. On the one hand, he praised Zhu Yuanzhang for using strong means to "build" "national discipline," "stabilize" "governing power," and "eliminate" corruption, "so that the local officials were all fearful of the law, clean themselves, and loved the people, and the atmosphere of officialdom was completely changed." "The disadvantages of generals being arrogant and soldiers rebelling since the Tang and Song dynasties" were also "completely eradicated." On the other hand, he praised Zhu Yuanzhang's "benevolent governance." He said that Zhu Yuanzhang's "severity and brutality seem to be used exclusively to deal with the 'haves'; for the 'have-nots,' he used another attitude and another method." This "another method" is "to appease the farmers, actively benefit the farmers, and passively eliminate harm for the farmers." Wu Han's overall evaluation of Zhu Yuanzhang's rule is: "During the Hongwu Dynasty, the government was tyrannical above, and the people were at peace below."

    Wu Han simply praised Zhu Yuanzhang to the sky, saying that he was "a great national hero!" "The greatest military commander!" "The greatest statesman!" As for Zhu Yuanzhang's personal character, he also made meticulous beautification and praise.

    Chiang Kai-shek praised Zhu Yuanzhang intentionally to compare himself to Zhu Yuanzhang. It seems that Wu Han understood this intention very sensitively. Moreover, he realized a "secret": praising the emperor is praising Chiang Kai-shek. Therefore, he wrote many articles, praising the emperor: what Emperor Wen of the Han Dynasty "cared for the people" was "meticulous," Tang Taizong was "worried about the country and the people, impartial and abiding by the law," "the rule of the Zhao Song Dynasty for three hundred and twenty years" "brought virtue to the people," and so on and so forth. Later, he also created a "theoretical basis" for beautifying the emperors, saying that the emperor was not autocratic in "normal times," and "the era of harsh, tyrannical, dictatorial, and dark, although not entirely absent in history, can be said to be abnormal." In 1946, in his article "Limitations on Monarchical Power in History," he further said: "In the past forty years, popular textbooks and other books have generally had a misunderstanding, thinking that before the establishment of the Republic of China, the political system for thousands of years was all autocratic monarchical, and even all harsh, tyrannical, dictatorial, and dark. This is obviously wrong. Before and after the revolution, it was a suitable strategy to hold this argument to attack the monarchical system. But now that the monarchical system has long become a historical relic, we should not falsely accuse the ancients, and should calmly restore its original appearance." Here, Wu Han not only beautified the emperor's autocratic monarchy, but also whitewashed Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial rule.

    In 1949, Wu Han revised "Ming Taizu" and republished it under the title of "Biography of Zhu Yuanzhang." In this book, Wu Han scolded Zhu Yuanzhang for killing people, being autocratic, dictatorial, lacking humanity, etc. According to Wu Han, this was to insinuate Chiang Kai-shek, so he devalued Zhu Yuanzhang (Note: Wu Han accidentally revealed the secret. Since scolding Zhu Yuanzhang is to express dissatisfaction with Chiang Kai-shek, then praising Zhu Yuanzhang in the first place is not also praising Chiang Kai-shek?). But in the overall evaluation, he still praised Zhu Yuanzhang as a "national hero" and "a successful politician," saying that he was "extremely intelligent, good at planning, foresighted, seeing the big picture, decisive, and good at accepting good suggestions, not self-righteous" (Note: This also revealed the truth. Since scolding this Zhu Yuanzhang refers to Chiang Kai-shek, then fundamentally affirming that the same Zhu Yuanzhang is a "national hero" and "a successful politician," is it not fundamentally affirming that Chiang Kai-shek, this public enemy of the people, is a "national hero" and "a successful politician"?)

    Asking Chiang Kai-shek to Learn from "Historical Lessons" and Devote All Efforts to Eliminate the Communist Party

    Slandering Peasant Uprisings as "Bandits," Reminding Chiang Kai-shek Not to Regard the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army as a "Minor Ailment"

    In 1934, when the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army began the Long March, Wu Han wrote "The Social Background of the 'Bandits' in the Late Ming Dynasty," offering advice to the Kuomintang reactionaries. The article specifically added a subtitle: "The Lessons of the Past Are Not Far Away, in the Era of the Xiahou Clan"! The meaning of this sentence is to remind the Kuomintang authorities to learn from the historical experience of the late Ming Dynasty in dealing with revolutionary armed forces.

    In this article, Wu Han slandered the peasant uprising army as "bandits," "rioters," and "rebellious people." He said that the lesson of the late Ming Dynasty was that "the rulers at that time" were careless at the beginning, regarding the peasant uprising as a "minor ailment," "sleeping soundly," and could not have imagined that the peasant uprising army "once it had power" would come to "seize power." Based on these lessons, he proposed two ways to deal with peasant uprisings: one is that in this "time of crisis," the ruling group should "unite" and not "calculate each other and intrigue"; the other is to implement "appeasement" to fundamentally block the "source of chaos" to avoid "digging their own graves."

    At the same time as the newspaper published Wu Han's article, it also published a commentary to cooperate. The author of the commentary said that after reading Wu Han's article, he "thought of today." We "also have a group of bandits that must be wiped out" and "also have a group of gentlemen that must be supported" (that is, the rulers Wu Han mentioned). The commentator also said: The "current group of bandits" cannot be "regarded as ordinary minor ailments." "We, who are entrusted to the shelter of the gentleman's group, naturally hope that its enemies will quickly perish." Therefore, according to Wu Han's inspiration, the commentator put forward the method of "appeasement and suppression."

    After Wu Han published this article, he successively wrote many articles slandering peasant uprisings. In 1936, in his article "The Collapse of the Yuan Empire and the Founding of the Ming Dynasty," he said: "Farmers are not very able to understand the meaning of political revolution, and generally take patience and self-preservation as the best virtue. To get them to participate in the revolution, you must add some religious or superstitious colors." He also promoted that peasants "have to rely on the financial resources of the landlords and cooperate with them" in the process of the uprising, and can only succeed by cooperating with the landlords.

    In 1943, in his book "Ming Taizu," he also said: The common people suffered from the squeeze between the "official army" and the Red Army. "The official army regarded him as the Red Army, and the Red Army regarded him as a spy of the official army. It was difficult to be a human being on both sides, and they had to provide food and fodder. The Red Army wanted it, and the official army wanted it again, causing everyone to be in danger. Those with money and land were afraid of trouble and went to the official army's side. Those without money and land, needless to say, wrapped a red turban and went to Haozhou to do rebellious things."

    Later, Wu Han also viciously slandered the motives of peasant uprisings, saying that the peasants "fought hard for more than ten years, what for? Nothing more than to be a high official, be given a great title, seal a wife and shade a son, a large manor, good servants, countless gold and silver coins, endless silk and satin, live a glorious, decent, and comfortable life."

    Wanting the Reactionaries to Take the Demise of the Ming Dynasty as a Warning and "Use All Their Efforts to Eliminate the 'Bandits'"

    In 1944, just as the soldiers and civilians in the Liberated Areas had survived the most difficult years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, repelled the third anti-communist upsurge launched by the Kuomintang, and began to turn to a partial counter-offensive against the Japanese invaders, Wu Han published an article entitled "Historical Lessons Three Hundred Years Ago." In this article, Wu Han used the technique of using ancient examples to imply the present, obliquely slandering the Communist Party as "bandits," accusing some Kuomintang generals of failing to resist communism effectively, and wanting the Kuomintang to learn from the lessons of the demise of the Zhu Ming Dynasty and devote all their efforts to eliminate the Communist Party.

    Wu Han said in the article: "History is a mirror. Three hundred years ago, there were too many things worth remembering." "Three hundred years ago, after Emperor Sizong of Ming died for the country, Li Zicheng went west, and the Qing people, with the guidance of Wu Sangui, occupied Beiping and divided their troops to the south. The Hongguang Emperor, the leader of the small court in Nanjing, was decorating the world with peace, building palaces, preparing for a hundred lights, recruiting songs and dances, day and night. His father died unnaturally, his original spouse was scattered and lost, the monarch died for the country, part of the country fell to the bandits, and part was ravaged by the might of foreign troops (the emphasis is added by the editor). The people were displaced, destroyed by war, threatened by hunger and plague, and no eggs were intact in the overturned nest. Even birds and beasts should understand the seriousness of the current crisis. However, this emperor still didn't care."

    He also said: "Three hundred years ago, on the eve of the demise of the small court in Nanjing, the Qing troops approached Jiangbei, the bandits roamed Jin and Shaanxi, the people were poor and the finances were exhausted, and internal and external troubles were intertwined. Prime Minister Ma Shiying relied on a little private favor of supporting him and monopolized the power of the court, excluding dissidents."

    He also said: "Three hundred years ago, when foreign iron hooves roamed Hebei, the main force of the 'bandits' wantonly expanded in Jin and Yu, the country was broken and the people were scattered, and people could not live. Zuo Liangyu, who had hundreds of thousands of troops and was entrenched in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, remained unmoved and watched the rise and fall. He saw through the chaos of the political situation. As long as he could preserve his strength and give a little bribe to the authorities, he would naturally be promoted to a higher rank and ennobled his wife and shade his son. Under this view, he was unwilling to use all his efforts to eliminate the 'bandits,' but used all his efforts to expand the army."

    Finally, Wu Han said: "Three hundred years later, we think about the situation three hundred years ago. The lessons of the past are not far away, in the era of the Xiahou clan."

    Under the Guise of a "Third Party," Small Criticism and Big Help to Chiang Kai-shek, Opposing the People's Liberation War

    Nonsensically saying that the civil war is "two parties fighting," "the people suffer," exonerating the US-Chiang reactionaries for launching the civil war

    In 1946, Chiang Kai-shek, with the support of US imperialism, launched a full-scale civil war. In the first half of the year, he launched a large-scale offensive against the Northeast Liberated Area, and in the second half of the year, he launched a full-scale offensive against the Liberated Areas. At this time, Wu Han flaunted a "third party" position, equating the counter-revolutionary civil war launched by the Kuomintang with the revolutionary self-defense war led by the Communist Party, obliterating the difference between just and unjust wars, and essentially exonerating the US-Chiang reactionaries for launching the civil war and slandering the revolutionary war led by the Communist Party. In January 1946, in a letter to the old representatives of the Political Consultative Conference, Wu Han, posing as a "people's representative," indiscriminately accused the Communist Party, the Kuomintang, and the Youth Party. He said: "Your party history, your party program, and your self-promoting propaganda, we people, to be honest, are not very interested." In the article "On the Anti-Civil War Movement," Wu Han said: "The two parties are at odds, the people suffer, and incurring the anger of the people will not do any good." He also arrogantly shouted: People "see clearly" that "the Kuomintang will never be able to eliminate the Communist Party, and vice versa, the Communist Party will not be able to eliminate the Kuomintang." (Note: This sentence was deleted when it was included in "Touqiang Ji.") In the article "On the Basic Plan for Solving the Situation," he also said: "Although the opponents of the civil war are only the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the land resources, manpower, and financial resources belong to all the people. The two parties are fighting, and the two parties unilaterally agree to talk to each other and completely ignore the people. Important matters related to the life and death of the people themselves are not allowed to be decided by the people, or even interfered with."

    In June 1946, just as the Northeast ceasefire was fifteen days, and the two sides were negotiating, Wu Han published an article entitled "Fifteen Days That Determine the Future History," taking the opportunity to spread rumors and oppose the People's Liberation War. He said: The civil war is "one mistake after another, the mistake is that it is believed that national affairs can be resolved by several political parties, talking and fighting, fighting and talking, fighting and talking." "Fifteen days have slipped away for four days. These fifteen days cannot only be the fifteen days of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but should be the fifteen days of the people of the whole country. We should take action to tell the two sides in the negotiations that these fifteen days are the final limit that the people can tolerate. After this limit, the people will rise up to stop this shameful civil war. We no longer trust any promises and words, what we want is a permanent cessation of the civil war."

    Fearing that the result of the civil war would "cause the Communist Party to become stronger and the Kuomintang to become more decadent," advising the Kuomintang to do more "good deeds" to deceive the people

    In many articles, Wu Han repeatedly expressed his anti-civil war stance, thinking of the Kuomintang, and "planning for the future" of the Kuomintang. In the article "On the Anti-Civil War Movement," he said: "Take a step back and think about the Kuomintang...The only consequence of fighting a civil war is further inflation, the political situation is even more hopeless, the people are even more miserable, running away from Yang and returning to Mo, driving fish into the deep sea, causing the Communist Party to become stronger and the Kuomintang to become more decadent. It is also not worth it." (Note: In this passage, Wu Han deleted the words "running away from Yang and returning to Mo, driving fish into the deep sea, causing the Communist Party to become stronger" when it was included in "Touqiang Ji.")

    In August 1946, when the Kuomintang's reactionary policies of dictatorship, civil war, and national betrayal had been fully exposed, Wu Han still spread illusions about Chiang Kai-shek to the people in his articles, and advised the Kuomintang reactionaries to "do some good deeds" to win over the masses. In the article "What to Do?" Wu Han talked about the issue of organizing a coalition government and implementing popular elections, saying: "One thing that must be noted is that all parties and factions and social elites must work hard to win the people's choice from today." He offered advice to Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary regime, saying: "The people's choice is very simple...Whoever can give these minimum requirements with real guarantee, the people will wholeheartedly support it." (Note: Of course, it refers to Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary regime.)

    Then, Wu Han emphasized: "I want to advise the Kuomintang authorities in the capacity of the people. While you are still in power today, do a little more good deeds, do it immediately, do it and then say it, it is better to do it and not say it. The hungry are easy to feed, the thirsty are easy to drink, and the people's satisfaction is not troublesome. At least, don't do bad things anymore. Cancel the requisition and requisition, cancel the special agent agencies, stop fighting the wind and killing the wind, withdraw the order to close newspapers and stop periodicals, abolish China Textile and China Silk, severely punish corrupt officials, I dare to guarantee that the people will also guarantee that as long as you can do these, completely do it, you don't have to worry about the people not standing on your side." In the article "On Thug Politics," Wu Han said to the Kuomintang: "For the sake of the future of a historical political party, for the sake of the future destiny of the Chinese people, for the sake of the historical future of the Republic of China, it should not be fought anymore!" "Only by doing this can it be a blessing for the Chinese people and a blessing for the Kuomintang."

    In the article "On Cultural Slaughter," Wu Han narrated the history of the Qin and Qing dynasties twice implementing cultural

    请看吴晗同志解放前的政治面目！
    王正萍　丁伟志
    编者按：本报于四月十日发表了《吴晗同志反党反社会主义反马克思主义的政治思想和学术观点》的材料，披露了吴晗同志在全国解放以后的反动言论。现在再把王正萍、丁伟志等同志整理的吴晗同志在全国解放前公开发表的主要言论，发表于下。
    在三十年代，吴晗同志奔走于胡适、蒋廷黻、傅斯年之流的门下，成为他们精心培养的一个标本，这是人所共知的。
    解放以前，吴晗同志究竟是个什么样的人呢？大家从这个材料中可以看出，原来他是站在亲蒋、崇美、反共的立场的人，是一个一心想走第三条道路即资产阶级专政道路的人。吴晗同志白纸黑字写下来的东西，将擦亮很多人的眼睛。
    希望大家认真读一读这个材料，这将有助于大家理解吴晗同志在六十年代走上反党反社会主义的道路并不是偶然的。同时，这个材料也有助于大家进一步揭露、批判吴晗同志的反动的立场和思想。
    攻击抗日救亡运动，为蒋介石不抵抗政策效劳
    胡适反动主张的忠实追随者和积极的宣传员
    据吴晗自己讲，他是一九三○年在中国公学胡适的文化班上写出了第一篇论文：《西汉的经济状况》。这篇文章，很受胡适赏识。他还说，由于胡适离校，觉得再念下去也“无聊”了，于是跑到北平。凭靠胡适的人情，一九三一年，他考进清华大学，系主任蒋廷黻还特别给了他“工读生”的优待。在胡适、蒋廷黻之流加意训练和扶植下，吴晗走上了“治学”的道路。①胡适曾在一封信中，指示他要“训练自己作一个能整理明代史料的学者”，要“小题大做”、“脚踏实地”等等。吴晗在回信里，把胡适的指点，肉麻地颂扬为“一颗天际明星”。他说：“凭着先生的好意，得入清华，一眨眼又是三星期了。上次先生所指示的几项，读后恍如在无边的旷野中，夜黑人孤，骤然得着一颗天际明星，光耀所及，四面八方都是坦途。在上星期已托人买了一部崇文本的明史，逐日点读，……准备先把明史念完后，再照先生所指示的逐步做去。”②
    从“九一八”起，日本帝国主义大举侵华，中华民族面临着生死存亡的关头，而蒋介石正在实行卖国的不抵抗政策。这时，胡适等人，适应蒋介石反动派的政治需要，大力鼓吹“整理国故”，要青年置民族危亡于不顾，埋头“治学”。
    吴晗当时是胡适这种反动主张的忠实的追随者和积极的宣传员。他在胡适具体指导下写了一篇《胡应麟年谱》，竭力推崇明朝人胡应麟钻故纸堆，闭门著书，“与蠹鱼醯鸡争雄长鼠穴中”的精神，表扬胡应麟“锐意成一家言”，“世间事无足上眉尖胸次者”，“是非臧否，一切置之罔闻”。③
    吴晗自己也身体力行，躲在图书馆里，致力于烦琐无聊的考证。一九三一年底到一九三二年，他一口气写了三篇考据“西王母”的文章，旁征博引，考证了传说中“西王母”的相貌、婚姻、儿女、服饰，乃至“西王母簪”、“西王母席”、“西王母枣”、“西王母桃”；考出了“西王母”至少有“二十四个女儿，二十四个女婿，几百十位外孙”。④
    吴晗还积极参与了傅斯年发起的“明成祖生母考”的“学术讨论”，长篇大论地考证，只是为了证明成祖并非高皇后嫡出，乃唝妃所生。⑤
    一九三四年，吴晗写了《胡惟庸党案考》。这就是一九六二年右倾机会主义分子掀起一股“翻案风”的时候，吴晗兴致勃勃地向人们推荐的那篇文章。在那篇文章里，他说，“胡案”以及以后的几桩大案，都是由于朱元璋对“功臣宿将”不放心，而
  “和他的秘书们”“巧为造作”出来的冤案。并且说，“胡惟庸党案”，“含有重大意义，其影响及于有明一代。”⑥
    辱骂抗日救亡运动是“装门面”、“显时髦”、“一窝蜂”、“鸟兽散”
      “九一八”、“一二八”的炮火，激起了全国人民无比的愤怒。在中国共产党的领导下，各地学生掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的抗日救亡运动，“打倒日本帝国主义”、“打倒卖国的国民党政府”的口号响彻了大小城市，爱国的标语、传单贴满了街头。所有这一切，非但没有打动埋头于故纸堆，一心要当学者、教授的吴晗的心弦，反而招致到他的恶毒的冷嘲热骂。
    一九三二年三月，他在《清华周刊》上用酉生的化名发表文章，⑦污蔑学生的救亡运动是为了“装门面”、“显时髦”，在“社会上露脸”，故作“爱国的表现”。讽刺爱国学生的集会、游行、示威、请愿和组织义勇军，是“一套公式”，“三星期后”，仍旧“上课、睡觉、吃饭”，“抱起参考书预备大考”，仍用“有光纸”而不用国产纸张写字。
    他用极其刻毒的词句，谩骂请愿的学生，去时“一窝蜂”，回来“鸟兽散”；嘲笑徒步请愿象“妙峰山进香者”那样“徒步瞻礼”，南下请愿坐的是“国家的火车”，“用不着自己掏腰包”。他恶狠狠地质问宣告绝食的学生：“假使你真饿死了，谁能来替你呼冤”？
    青出于蓝。吴晗的这篇《过去种种》的大作，与一九二五年胡适发表的《爱国运动与求学》⑧有过之而无不及。当年胡适污蔑五卅运动中的“民气”，是“五分钟的热度”，讽刺参加爱国运动的青年是因为“忍不住”别人的“引诱与讥笑”而跑出了课堂。吴晗的冷嘲热骂，完全是承受了胡适的一套衣钵。
    为国民党反动统治的“长治久安”出谋划策
    说“士”是效忠于主人的，要蒋介石提高“士”的地位，发挥“士”的作用
    一九四三年前后，吴晗觉得自己当了几年教授，已经挤进“士”的行列，应该“学而优则仕”了，于是便大谈起“士”在政治上的重要作用来，借以向蒋介石集团毛遂自荐，讨个官做。
    一九四三年，吴晗发表了《说士》，拼命宣扬“士”在历史上的作用。他说：“在春秋时代，金字塔形的统治阶级，王诸侯大夫以下的阶层就是士，士和以上的阶层比较，人数最多，势力也最大。其下是庶民和奴隶，是劳力者，是小人”。“士介在上下层两阶级之间，受特殊的教育，在平时是治民的官吏，在战时是战争的主力。就上层的贵族阶级说，是维持治权的唯一动力”。
    吴晗借古喻今，向当权的国民党反动派表白，包括他自己在内的“士”，对主子是绝对忠实的。他说：“士在政治上社会上负有特殊任务，在四民中，独享教育的特权”，“不但受特殊的教育训练，也受特殊的精神训练”。“在这两种训练下，养成了他们的道德观念——忠”。又说：“在封建时代，各国并立，士的生活由他的主人诸侯或大夫所赐的田土维持，由于这种经济关系，士只能效忠于主人。”秦汉以后“士便直属于君主于国家。”“士分为文武以后，道德观念依然不变，几千年以来的文士和武士，轰轰烈烈，为国家为民族而斗争，而流血，而牺牲，不屈不挠，前仆后继，悲壮勇决的事迹，史不绝书。”
    吴晗特别提醒当时的统治者注意这样的“历史教训”：“王诸侯大夫如不能得到士的支持，不但政权立即崩溃，自家也不能保全。”
    讲过“历史教训”，吴晗便转而直接向蒋介石献策，把话说明白了。他说：“古代对士的教育和训练，应加以重视，尤其应该着重道德观念——对国家（编者按　当然是国民党法西斯专政的国家）对民族尽责的精神的养成。”“要提高士的社会地位，必须文事和武事并重，必须政治水准和社会地位提高，这是今后全国所应全力以赴的课题。”⑨
    一九四三年，吴晗在《明太祖》一书中，再一次向统治者诉说，“知识分子”的重要性。他说：“朱元璋对于知识分子，特别看重，虚心听从他们的劝告，完成自己的教育。每克一地，必访求当地的贤才，罗致于自己幕府中”。吴晗还列举了一些“幕府人才”如何向朱元璋出谋献策，从而奠定了朱元璋后来的帝业的例子。⑩
    吴晗的自荐，似乎并未引起当时统治者的足够重视。这使得他大为失望，于是在一九四四年七月又写了一篇《生活与思想》，发泄牢骚。他说，包括他自己在内的、不是“权贵”的“中年人”，“失去信心”了，形成“一种世界末的人生观”，“已经断了心，放弃了赶上去的幻梦”。说“断了心”，是故作姿态，其实还是想“赶上去”，所以在这篇文章的结尾处，他便大声疾呼：“中年人”的这种状态，“是‘国家’的隐忧”！依他说，解决这“隐忧”的“唯一的办法”，就是给这些失意的“中年人”安排一条“出路”，“预备一辆自行车”！?（按　所谓“自行车”者，即“一官半职”也）
    掩饰国民党的贪污罪行，胡说贪污的根源是由于“家族为本位”
    一九四三年，正当蒋介石反动政权极度腐败的时候，吴晗写了《论贪污》、《贪污史的一章》?等文，为国民党贪污成风，开脱罪责。在这些文章中，他用资产阶级社会学的观点，把旧社会的贪污风气的根源，归结为什么“社会教育”、“社会环境”、“政治环境”等等，避而不谈社会制度这个根本问题。
    吴晗把历史上皇帝的贪污，说成是偶然的现象。他说：“过去历史上皇帝是国家元首，皇帝的宫廷财政和国家财政向来分开，但是有时候皇帝昏乱浪费，公私不分，以国产为私产，恣意挥霍，闹得民穷财尽，这种情形，史不绝书。最奇的是皇帝也有贪污的”。
    他说：“历朝的政治家用尽了心力，想法子肃清贪污，树立廉洁的吏治。不外两种办法，第一是厚禄……，第二是严刑”。吴晗认为，“厚禄”、“严刑”，“暂时都有相当效果，却都不能久远”。“原因是这两个办法只能治标，对贪污的根本原因不能发生作用。治本的唯一办法，应该从整个历史和社会组织去理解。”
    怎样从整个历史和社会组织去理解？吴晗的解释是：“一直到今天为止，我们的社会组织，我们的文化都是以家族为本位的。”“一旦青云得路，父族妻族儿女姻戚或故旧乡里都一拥而来，禄薄固不能支给，即禄厚又何尝能够全部应付，更何况上官要承迎，要人要敷衍，送往迎来，在在需钱！如不贪污非饿死羞死不可！”
    吴晗说：“根据这个理解，贪污的根绝，治本的办法应该是把‘人’从家族的桎梏下解放出来。个人生活的独立，每一个人都为工作而生存，人与人之间无倚赖心。”“‘人’能够独立存在以后，工作的收入足够生活，法律的制裁使他不愿犯禁，厚禄严刑，交互为用，社会上有公开的舆论指导监督，政府中有有力的监察机关举劾纠弹，‘衣食足而知荣辱’，贪污的肃清当然可操左券。”
    一九四三年，正当国民党统治区通货膨胀、而蒋介石集团苦于无法应付的时候，吴晗“破门而出”，研究起金融问题来，写了《记大明通行宝钞》，?大谈明朝各代钞法利弊，以及防止货币贬值的种种措施，表示自己对这个问题颇有研究。
    很明显，吴晗那时热中于“论贪污”、“论宝钞”，都是为了引起国民党当局的重视，博得反动统治者的青睐。
    追随蒋介石，美化朱元璋；通过朱元璋，吹捧蒋介石
    一九四○年三月，蒋介石亲自出马，为方觉慧写的《明太祖革命武功记》?写了一篇序。在这篇序里，蒋介石把朱元璋大大颂扬了一番，说“明祖崛起草莱，志期匡复，收揽豪俊，剪刈群雄，十五年间遂成光复华夏之大业。”他特别赞赏朱元璋“武定祸乱、文致太平”，“戡乱伐叛、平蛮柔远”的成绩，和“宽猛相济，威德兼施”的手段。他说，朱元璋的这些事，“不惟足供历史学之参考”，而且可以“资”“建国之借镜”。
    圣旨一出，忙坏了吴晗，他立即动笔来“应帝王”了。一九四○年九月，他写出《记明实录》，?一九四一年四月，又发表了《明教与大明帝国》。?在这个基础上，吴晗于一九四三年写出了《明太祖》一书。这本书，是当时的国民党中央宣传部副部长兼中央图书杂志审查委员会主任委员潘公展主编的一套丛书中的一本。潘公展还为这套丛书写了“编纂旨趣”。他说明这套丛书的出版，“祗有一个目的，就是希望在建国的文化坦途上，贡献力量，建筑小小的基石”。他说，编入这套丛书“第一辑”的，是“民族伟人”，即“有大德于天下，永为国人顶礼膜拜者”。吴晗的《明太祖》，就是按照潘公展规格，用“顶礼膜拜”的笔调写出来的。
    在《明太祖》这本书里，吴晗完全贯彻了并具体发挥了蒋介石对朱元璋的评论。吴晗亦步亦趋地跟着蒋介石，歌颂朱元璋的文治武功，歌颂他“平定群雄”，“赤手建国”；歌颂他“北伐”成功，使中华民族，“不但得救，而且复兴了”；歌颂他建国后的一整套政治措施，说《大明律》是“在整个立法史上”“最重要最伟大的一部法典”，甚至赞美朱元璋推行的统治人民的“里甲制”，也是“劝导农民合作的好办法”。
    蒋介石特别赞赏朱元璋实行的“宽猛相济，威德并施”的反动的“两手”。鹦鹉学舌，吴晗也跟着蒋介石大肆称赞朱元璋的统治手段。一方面，他称赞朱元璋以强暴的手段，“建设”起了“国家纪纲”，“稳定”了“治权”，“肃清”了贪污，“由于，一时地方守令都惴惧畏法，洁己爱民，吏治风气，焕然丕变”。“唐、宋以来的悍将跋扈、骄兵叛变的弊端”，也“完全根绝了”。另一方面，他又称赞朱元璋的“德政”。他说，朱元璋的“严酷和残暴，似乎专用以对付‘有’的阶级；对于‘无’的穷人，他便用另一种态度，另一种方法。”这“另一种方法，”就是“安抚农民的办法，积极的为农民兴利，消极的为农民除害”。吴晗对朱元璋统治的总评价是：“洪武一朝，政虐于上，民安于下”。
    吴晗简直把朱元璋捧上了天，说他是“伟大的民族英雄”！“最伟大的军事统帅”！“最伟大的政治家”！至于朱元璋的个人品行，他也作了无微不至的美化和吹捧。
    蒋介石捧朱元璋，是有意把自己比作朱元璋的。看来，吴晗领会这种意图，是很敏感的。而且，他从此悟出了一个“秘诀”：捧皇帝者即捧蒋介石也。于是，他写了许多文章，大捧皇帝：什么汉文帝“对人民的爱护”是“无微不至”?啦，唐太宗是“忧国忧民，至公守法”?啦，“赵宋三百二十年的统治”“德泽在民”?啦，等等等等，不一而足。后来，他还制造出一种美化帝王的“理论根据”，说皇帝在“常态上”并不是专制的，“苛暴的、独裁的、黑暗的时代，历史上虽不尽无，但都可说是变态的”。一九四六年，他在《历史上的君权的限制》一文中，又进一步说：“近四十年来，坊间流行的教科书和其他书籍，普遍的有一种误解，以为在民国成立以前，几千年来的政体全是君主专制的，甚至全是苛暴的，独裁的，黑暗的，这话显然有错误。在革命前后持这论调以攻击君主政体，固然是一个合宜的策略。但是现在，君主政体早已成为历史陈迹的现在，我们不应厚诬古人，应该平心静气的还其本来面目。”?在这里，吴晗不仅美化皇帝的君主专制，而且还在替蒋介石的独裁统治粉饰。
    一九四九年，吴晗把《明太祖》修改过后，以《朱元璋传》的书名再版。在这本书中，吴晗把朱元璋骂了一通，骂他杀人、专制、独裁、缺少人性等等。据吴晗说，这是为了影射蒋介石，才贬低了朱元璋（按　吴晗不小心泄了天机，既然骂朱元璋是表示对蒋介石的不满，那末当初赞扬朱元璋，不也就是对蒋介石的歌颂吗？）但是在总的评价上，还称颂朱元璋为“民族英雄”、“成功的政治家”，说他“智力极高，长于计谋，看得远，见得大处，当机立断，更善接受好建议，不自以为是”?（按　这又露出了马脚，既然骂这个朱元璋是指蒋介石的，那末从根本上肯定同一个朱元璋是“民族英雄”、“成功的政治家”，难道不是从根本上肯定蒋介石这个人民公敌是“民族英雄”、“成功的政治家”吗？）
    要蒋介石吸取“历史教训”，全力以赴消灭共产党
    诬蔑农民起义为“流寇”，提醒蒋介石不要把工农红军看成“疥癣之疾”
    一九三四年，工农红军开始长征的时候，吴晗写了《晚明“流寇”之社会背景》，向国民党反动派献策。文章特别加了一个副标题：“殷鉴不远，在夏后之世”！这话的意思是，提醒国民党当局从明末历史中汲取对付革命武装的经验教训。
    在这篇文章中，吴晗诬蔑农民起义军为“流寇”、“暴民”、“乱民”。他说，明末的教训是“当时的统治者”，开始的时候大意了，把农民起义看成是“疥癣之疾”，“高枕而卧”，料想不到农民起义军“一有了势力”，竟来“夺取政权”。他根据这些经验教训，提出了两条对付农民起义的办法：一条是，在这种“火烧眉睫的时候”，统治集团要“联合起来”，不要“勾心斗角地互相计算”；另一条是，施行“抚恤”，从根本上堵死“致乱之源”，以免“自掘坟墓”。?
    报纸发表吴晗这篇文章的同时，还发表了一篇评论来配合。评论的作者说，读了吴晗的文章，就“想到今世”，我们“也有非扑灭不可的流贼集团”，“也有非拥护不可的君子集团”（即吴晗所说的统治者）。评论者还说：不能把“眼前的流贼集团”“当作寻常的疥癣末疾看待”。“我们托身于君子集团的庇下，自然盼望它的敌人快归毁灭”。于是评论者根据吴晗的启示，提出了“以抚济剿”的办法。?
    吴晗发表这篇文章以后，又陆陆续续写了许多诬蔑农民起义的文章。一九三六年，他在《元帝国之崩溃与明之建国》一文中说：“农民是不很能了解政治革命的意义的，一般地都以忍耐苟安为最好的德性。要他们来参加革命，也非加上一些宗教的或迷信色彩的外障不可”。他还宣传，农民在起义的过程中，“不得不靠地主的财力和他们合作”，而且只有与地主合作才能成功。?
    一九四三年，他在《明太祖》一书中又说：老百姓在“官军”和红军之间受夹板罪，“官军把他当红军，红军又把他当官军的奸细，左右做人难，又得供给粮秣，红军要了，官军又要，闹得人人自危，有钱有地的人怕事，都投到官军这边，无钱无地的人不消说，包上一块红头巾，投奔濠州，干反叛的勾当去了”。?
    后来，吴晗还恶毒诬蔑农民起义的动机，说农民“苦战了十几年，为的是什么？无非是为作大官，拜大爵位，封妻荫子，大庄园，好奴仆，数不尽的金银钱钞，用不完的锦绮绸罗，风风光光，体体面面，舒舒服服的过日子”。?
    要反动派以明王朝覆灭为鉴，“用全力来消灭‘流寇’”
    一九四四年，正当解放区军民，度过了抗日战争最艰苦的年代，打退了国民党发动的第三次反共高潮的时候，并开始转入对日寇局部反攻的时候，吴晗发表了一篇题为《三百年前的历史教训》的文章。在这篇文章中，吴晗以借古喻今的手法，含沙射影地污蔑共产党是“流寇”，责备国民党某些将领反共不力，要国民党吸取朱明王朝覆灭的教训，全力以赴消灭共产党。
    吴晗在文章中说：“历史是一面镜子，三百年前，有太多的事情，值得我们追念。”“三百年前，当明思宗殉国以后，李自成西走，清人借吴三桂的向导，占领北平分兵南下的时候，南京小朝廷领袖弘光帝，正在粉饰升平，兴建宫室，大备百光，征歌选舞，夜以继日。他的父亲死于非命，元配离散不知下落，国君殉国，国土一部分沦于流寇，一部分被异族兵威所蹂躏（按重点系编者所加。加重点的字，收入《投枪集》时，删去了。下同），人民流亡离散，被战争所毁灭，被饥饿瘟疫所威胁，覆巢之中无完卵，即使是禽兽也该明白当前危机的严重。然而这位皇帝还是满不在乎”。
    他又说“三百年前，当南京小朝廷覆亡的前夕，清兵迫近江北，流寇纵横晋陕，民穷财尽，内忧外患交迫的时候。宰相马士英凭了一点拥立的私恩，独擅朝权，排斥异己”。
    他还说“三百年前，当外族铁蹄纵横河朔，‘流寇’主力恣张晋豫，国破民散，人不聊生的时候，拥兵数十万虎踞长江上游的左良玉，却按兵不动，坐观兴亡。他看透了政局的混乱，只要自己能保全实力，舍出一点贿赂当局，自然会加官晋爵，封妻荫子。在这个看法之下，他不肯用全力来消灭‘流寇’，却用全力来扩充军队。”
    最后，吴晗说：“三百年后，我们想想三百年前的情形，殷鉴不远，在夏后氏之世。”?
    打着“第三者”的幌子，对蒋介石小骂大帮忙，反对人民解放战争
    胡说内战是“两党打仗”，“人民受罪”，为美蒋反动派发动内战开脱罪责
    一九四六年，蒋介石在美帝国主义支持下，发动了全面内战。上半年大举进攻东北解放区，下半年向各解放区发动全面的进攻。这时候，吴晗却标榜“第三者”立场，把国民党发动的反革命内战和共产党领导的革命自卫战争，相提并论，抹杀正义战争和非正义战争的区别，实质上是为美蒋反动派发动内战开脱罪责，诬蔑共产党领导的革命战争。一九四六年一月，吴晗在写给旧政协代表的信中，以“人民代表”自居，对共产党和国民党、青年党，不分青红皂白，一概加以指责。他说：“你们的党史，你们的党纲，你们自吹自擂的宣传品，我们人民，老实说，都不大感兴趣。”?在《论反内战运动》一文中吴晗说：“两党相持，人民受罪，结怒于人民是不会有什么好处的”。还狂妄地叫喊道：人们“看得清楚”，“国民党决消灭不了共产党，反之，共产党也消灭不了国民党”。?（按　这句话在收入《投枪集》时，删去了。）在《论解决时局的基础方案》一文中又说：“内战的对手虽然只是国共双方，可是土地资源人力财力却是全体人民的，两党打仗，两党一相情愿自己谈而完全漠视人民，有关人民本身生死存亡的大事而不容许人民作主，甚至过问”。?
    一九四六年六月，正当东北停战十五天，双方进行谈判期间，吴晗发表了《决定今后历史的十五天》一文，又趁机散布流言，反对人民解放战争，他说：内战是“一错再错，错在认为国事可以由几个政党来解决，谈谈打打，打打谈谈，边打边谈，又打又谈。”“十五天已经溜走了四天了，这十五天不能只是国共两党的十五天，而应该是全国人民的十五天。我们应该有行动，告诉谈判中的双方，这十五天是人民所能容忍的最后限度。过了这限度，人民要自己起来制止这可耻的内战，我们不再信任任何诺言和文字，我们要的是永久停止内战。”?
    怕内战的结果“造成共产党的更强大、国民党的更没落”，劝国民党多做欺骗人民的“好事”
    吴晗在不少的文章中，一再表示他反内战的立场，是为国民党着想的，是为国民党“前途计”的。在《论反对内战运动》一文中，他说：“退一步替国民党想，……打内战的唯一后果是通货再膨胀，政治更无办法，人民更痛苦，逃杨归墨，为渊驱鱼，造成共产党的更强大，国民党的更没落，也是划算不来的。”?（按　这一段话中的“逃杨归墨，为渊驱鱼，造成共产党的更强大”这些话，吴晗在收入《投枪集》时，删去了）
    一九四六年八月，当国民党的独裁、内战、卖国的反动政策，已经充分暴露的时候，吴晗仍在文章中，向人民散布对蒋介石的幻想，并奉劝国民党反动派“做点好事”，争取群众。在《怎么办？》一文中，吴晗谈到组织联合政府，实行人民选举问题时说：“有一件事情必得注意的，就是各党各派和社会贤达从今天起就得努力争取人民的选择。”他向蒋介石反动政权献计说：“人民的选择很简单，……谁能给予以这些最低要求的切实保障，人民就会死心塌地拥护它。”（按　当然是指蒋介石反动政权。）
    接着，吴晗又强调说：“我要以人民的资格，奉劝国民党当局，趁今天还在位的时候，多做一点好事，即刻做，做了再说，做了而不说更好，饥者易为食，渴者易为饮，人民的满足是不费事的。至少，不要再做坏事，取消征购征实吧，取消特务机构吧，停止打风和杀风吧，收回封闭报纸停止期刊的命令吧，撤销中纺中蚕吧，严办贪官污吏吧，我敢保证，人民也会保证，你们只要能做到这些，完完全全的做到，是不愁人民不站在你们的这一边的。”?在《论打手政治》一文中，吴晗向国民党进言：“为一个有历史的政党前途计，为中华人民的前途命运计，为中华民国的历史前途计，不该再打了！”“只有这样做，才是中国人民之福，也是国民党之福。”?
    在《论文化杀戮》一文中，吴晗叙述了在中国历史上秦朝和清朝两次实行文化杀戮，皆造成了王朝的覆灭的历史，要蒋介石从中汲取“教训”。?
    向美帝国主义的头子献媚，说决不会忘记他们“在中国历史上的伟大功绩”
    一九四六年一月，当美帝国主义为了更好地帮助蒋介石部署内战兵力和消灭人民革命力量，制造所谓“调处”、“停战”等和平阴谋的时候，吴晗和潘光旦、费孝通等人，联名写信给美国“总统特使”马歇尔，大肆颂扬杜鲁门、马歇尔等帝国主义头子“在中国历史上的伟大功绩”。信中写道：
    “杜鲁门总统对华政策的声明传到中国，把我们多日忧患的心情一扫而清。民主的美国又一度坚强了世界上爱好和平的人民对它的信任。”“正在这紧张的关口，杜鲁门总统能发表这一个有历史性的文告，真是令我们不能不衷心感激。接着又接到你被任为特使，迅即来华执行上述声明的消息，更增加了我们无限的希望。”
    “我们在欢迎你的时候，心里又充满着惭愧。中国人民怎么不知道引起内战的，责任是全部应当由我们自己担负的？又怎么不知道我们的内战会威胁世界和平的？我们……已尽力向武装冲突的双方呼吁和平，停止内战；……美国人民在这时能作此严重的声明，实在是给我们为和平为民主而工作的中国人民一个有决定性的援助。我们惭愧自己不能把自己的家务整理明白，有劳我们的好友的斡旋；但是我们也不会忘记你们在中国历史上的伟大功绩。”
    “我们充分了解而且同意你的任务是贤明和正确的。……我们相信，象其他盟国一般地相信，你将执行的政策并不是以美国个别利益为出发点的。”
    “我们并不袒护在野而有武力的共产党，我们也反对任何政党私有武力”。
    “我们盼望国际的友人，为了世界和平，不但要劝阻国共交锋，而且能有效地在政治上和经济上给予建设民主的助力。”
    “我们对于你的服务不但感激而且有信心……敬祝你在历史上留下为我们后世子孙永志不忘的伟迹。”?
    吴晗在写了这封信以后，还在许多文章中，一再向美帝国主义献媚。一九四六年六月，在《决定今后历史的十五天》一文中，他说，不打内战，中国“才能够成为美国所需要的市场。”?
    一九四六年七月，在《是谁在辱国？谁在殃民？》一文中，吴晗还说：“千言万语归结成一句话，停战第一。这不只符合于中国人民的利益，也是符合于美国政府和美国人民的利益。”?
    幻想按照美国的样子，在中国建立资产阶级专政
    颂扬美国的资产阶级民主，吹捧罗斯福的“四大自由”
    一九四六年，正当美帝国主义支持蒋介石发动全面内战，企图消灭中国共产党，把中国变为美国殖民地的时候，吴晗在许多文章中，大肆颂扬美国的资产阶级民主制。在《论民主政治》一文中，他说：“罗斯福总统所提倡的四大自由，就比之林肯时代，华盛顿杰菲逊时代的说法，意义上，内容上，更丰富更重要，比之法国大革命时代所提倡，所喊出平等博爱自由也更向前迈进了一大段，比之英国旧大宪章时代是进步得太多了。”?
    一九四六年五月，在《报纸与舆论》一文中，吴晗极力美化“世界上的民主国家”的“民主”和“多党政治”。他说：“世界上的民主国家，或者多多少少有点民主气味的国家，报纸的主要任务是报导正确的消息，反映，发扬人民对于政府措施的意见，批评，指责，提出纠正，贡献意见，都是人民应有的权利。”
    他又说：“民主国家有一个特点，便是多党政治。在野的党有堂堂正正批评政府的权利，倒过来，在野党执政了，执政党在野，同样保有这权利。彼此互相批评，互相责难，一方面有权提出以事实为根据的质问，被质问的也有义务提供解释的事实，是非曲直，取决于人民的舆论”。（按：这一段话在收入《投枪集》时完全删去了。）
    吴晗还抹煞所谓“民主”国家的阶级本质。他说：“一个国家的前途，发展或停滞，向前或落后，繁荣或衰落，最好的测验器是这一个国家的报纸能不能，敢不敢代表舆论，这也是说明了这国家是为人民所统治，是为人民谋幸福，或是为少数人所统治，为少数人争权利。”?
    一九四八年五月，在国民党反动派召开伪“行宪国大”之后，吴晗在《论所谓“中国式的代议制度”》一文中宣扬“西洋议会的议员是人民选出来的”。
    说“我们得学学”美国的“民主方式”，建设一个“自由世界”
    吴晗不仅颂扬美国的“民主政治”，而且明确主张中国要实行美国的“民主政治”。在《论民主政治》中，他说：“就今天的中国而说，我们所要实行的民主，第一要适合于这个时代，不是历史上或十八九世纪的，也不是什么未来派的，二十一二世纪的，而是二十世纪，所谓人民世纪的民主政治，主要的根据是罗斯福的四大自由，俗言也就是政治的经济的民主。”
    他又说：“欧美一些国家人民所已经享受的正是我们今天所争取的，如思想言论身体出版旅行等自由，如选举权，如议会政治。都是今天中国人民所用全力争取的。”
    在《论法统》一文中，吴晗说：“故罗斯福总统连任了四次，每一次都由公开的合法的选举方法——他们由政纲政策，尤其重要的是过去几度执政的政绩，来要求选民的选票，和另一政党竞选，结果，选民果然选择了他们”，他强调说：“是的，我们得学学美国人民的民主方式，美国的政府是全世界全人类所公认的合法政府，因为这政府是由人民自己选举出来的。”他还以英国的“民主”制度举例说：“老牌民主国家的首相，丘吉尔先生和他的党，对英国总不能说没有大功了吧？可是人民不要他，工党不和他合作，只好举行大选，听凭人民的选择。人民呢，毫不含糊，选择了工党，选择了阿特里。丘吉尔先生承认这选择，保守党也承认了这选择。丘吉尔先生和保守党功成身退。这才是民主，这才是合于民主的法。”?
    吴晗在《报纸与舆论》一文中还说：“我们要建设真正的民主政治，自由世界，要从报纸能尽报导批评的责任，替人民服务，用公正的舆论来监督政府，指导政府开始”。?
    认为代表“中间阶层”的“民主个人主义者”，是“中国前途的引导者”
    一九四六、一九四七年间，一小撮资产阶级“民主个人主义者”，为了和中国共产党争夺群众，提出了由他们来代表和领导中间阶层实现“第三条道路”的反动理论。当时，吴晗也是唱的这个调子。吴晗一直认为，中国共产党所代表的只是“党派利益”，只有他这样的“知识分子”才是人民的真正“代表”。他要求让所谓“超党派”的“人民力量”来“决定一切，执行一切”。
    一九四六年，吴晗在《论新基础》一文中说：“人民的力量是潜在的，一个代表人民力量总和的组织，超出党派利益，代表广大的中间群众人民利益的组织在今天是必需的，应该使其立刻现实存在的。”“要建立一个以召集国是会议为中心的人民推动力量。”这“力量”“是坚强的前进的勇敢的经过考验的民主党派，团体和无量数的卓越的民主斗士的共同战斗体。”“这一力量的出现，它的使命不再是中间式的调人，而是完全站在人民立场的中国前途的引导者。”“于此，这力量的本身就是天平秤，决定一切，执行一切，而不是象过去那样，自身作为法码，作为一个相对的平衡的力量。”他说：“中国的人口假定有四万万五千万，中间阶层占百分之九十以上，百分之九十的人民能够参加这新基础，坚强这新基础，任何问题是可以解决的，任何困难是可以征服的。”?
    同年，他还写了一篇《论社会风气》，从纸堆里拣出些破烂，来作他这种反动理论的证据。他说，在中国历史上，时代精神和社会风气的形成，“大体上似乎都和小百姓无干，治天下者的作用也是推波助澜，主流实实在在发于中层的士大夫集团，加以上层的提倡，下层的随和，才会蔚为风气，磅礴一世。不管历史对所‘尚’的评价如何，就主流的发动而论，转变社会风气，也就是所谓移风易俗，只有中层的士大夫集团才能负起责任。”?
    一九四八年，吴晗在《知识分子今天的任务》中公然鼓吹一小撮资产阶级知识分子可以决定中国未来前途的荒谬观点。他说：“知识分子‘也还有光明的一面’”。他说这批人“肯接受新思想，对现局有正确的理解”，“勤于学习能用脑子，也能动手。中国未来的前途，就寄托在这一群人身上。”?注：①《我克服了“超阶级”观点》，见一九五○年二月《中国青年》第三十二期；《春天集》第五二至六二页。
