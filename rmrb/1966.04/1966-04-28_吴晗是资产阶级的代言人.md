    Wu Han waved the black flag of anti-Marxism and anti-Mao Zedong Thought in academic circles, writing books and selling bourgeois private goods on a large scale. In the past few years, he even "broke out of the gate" and wrote "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," launching an extremely arrogant attack on the Party and socialism.

    Why did Wu Han dare to be so blatantly anti-Party?

    This is determined by Wu Han's reactionary class nature. Chairman Mao said: "Intellectuals who harbor hostile sentiments towards our country are a very small minority. These people do not like our proletarian dictatorship, and they miss the old society. Given the opportunity, they will stir up trouble, trying to overthrow the Communist Party and restore the old China. These are the people who stubbornly want to take the latter path between the two lines of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the two lines of socialism and capitalism... These are some extremely reactionary people." We believe that Wu Han is such a person! Wu Han's remarks before and after liberation, published in newspapers and periodicals recently, eloquently prove that Wu Han has never been a revolutionary, let alone a "Marxist historian." His taking the road of anti-Party and anti-socialism in the 1960s was by no means accidental, but the inevitable result of the development of his own reactionary bourgeois ideology.

    Look: In the 1930s, when the Japanese寇 invaded China and the nation was in a critical state of survival, what was Wu Han doing? He sought favor with people like Hu Shi, maliciously insulting the anti-Japanese national salvation movement, and serving Chiang Kai-shek's policy of national betrayal and surrender. He actively responded to Hu Shi's reactionary proposition of "reorganizing national heritage" and practiced it himself. Hu Shi asked him to "study the history of the Ming Dynasty," so he plunged into the piles of old papers, studying the birth mother of Ming Taizu, and writing "A Study of the Case of Hu Weiyong's Party." Does this kind of person who is indifferent to the interests of the nation have the slightest revolutionary flavor?

    When Chiang Kai-shek vigorously praised Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang of the Ming Dynasty, intentionally comparing himself to Zhu Yuanzhang, Wu Han hurriedly wrote "Veritable Records of the Ming Dynasty," "Ming Religion and the Ming Empire," "Ming Taizu," and so on, endlessly. He described Zhu Yuanzhang as a "great national hero," "the greatest military commander," and "the greatest statesman," in order to praise Chiang Kai-shek to the skies.

    When Chiang Kai-shek launched a civil war, attempting to eliminate the Communist Party and eliminate the people's armed forces, he wrote extensively about the experience and lessons of the Ming Dynasty's suppression of peasant uprisings, alluding that the Communist Party and the people's armed forces were "bandits," and asking Chiang Kai-shek to learn from the lessons of the Ming Dynasty's demise and "use all his strength to eliminate the 'bandits'." How can such a person who advises Chiang Kai-shek on his anti-communist crimes claim to support the Communist Party and that "for more than 20 years... the class stand in politics has been firm." Isn't this openly deceiving people? What Wu Han "stood firm on" was the anti-communist stand, not anything else.

    After the national liberation, Wu Han did not transform his thinking in the slightest. He always hated the Party and socialism. When the right-wing opportunists vigorously opposed the Party, Wu Han again raised Hai Rui, a landlord official of the Ming Dynasty, and at the expense of tampering with history, shot several highly poisonous arrows such as "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor," "On Hai Rui," and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," frantically opposing the Party and socialism... These ironclad facts, Wu Han, don't even think about denying them! It brightens our eyes and makes us realize that Wu Han was originally a "historian" of the landlord bourgeoisie, an "authority" of the reactionary class, and their spokesperson. His research on history is not to serve the politics of the proletariat, but to serve the politics of the landlord bourgeoisie, which is used to be close to Chiang, worship the United States, and oppose the Communist Party!

    Around 1961, when our country suffered serious natural disasters and the national economy was experiencing temporary difficulties, imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries in the world colluded with each other, withdrawing experts, tearing up contracts, and engaging in counterattacks, invading our Tibet... It was rampant for a while, and a few dark clouds appeared in the sky. Domestic right-wing opportunists took the opportunity to launch a frantic attack on the Party, making it seem invincible. All reactionary people always overestimate their own strength. At this time, Wu Han thought that the sky was about to change and the opportunity had come, so he "broke out of the gate," raised the black flag, and frantically opposed the Party and socialism!

    However, Wu Han was wrong. History does not develop according to Wu Han's delusions. "Lifting a rock to drop it on one's own feet," Wu Han can only play a tragic role. Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we have carried out decades of armed struggle and more than ten years of socialist revolution, accumulating extremely rich revolutionary experience. We have seen enough of those things wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism; we have seen enough of those things that use the past to criticize the present; we have seen enough of those things that overestimate themselves and frantically oppose the Party! Our people are a people who have experienced storms and are not afraid of any risks! We have personally experienced that only by following the Party and Chairman Mao can we win. Wu Han's reactionary things don't even think about passing through here, Wu Han don't even think about digging out a grain of sand from the socialist building. Especially important is that we have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. In recent years, our broad masses of workers, peasants and soldiers have creatively studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, and their level of consciousness has been greatly improved. We understand what is true Marxism, what is in line with Mao Zedong Thought; what is false Marxism, what violates Mao Zedong Thought. Wu Han has only those two tricks, nothing great. No matter how he tries to deny, cover up, or even bite back at his reactionary words and deeds, we can see through it, and we can defeat him! Isn't it? As soon as Wu Han's reactionary things emerge, they will be severely attacked by hundreds of millions of people armed with Mao Zedong Thought! Everyone rises up to attack, and Wu Han's reactionary thoughts don't even think about finding a place to stay! All reactionary things will be eliminated, and we must smash Wu Han's frenzied attack!

    The train of history is rumbling forward. Wu Han's resistance is nothing more than a mantis trying to stop a chariot, and it will eventually be crushed by the wheels of history!

### 吴晗是资产阶级的代言人

    吴晗是资产阶级的代言人	解放军某部　李　庆
    吴晗在学术界中打起反马克思主义、反毛泽东思想的黑旗，著书立说，大肆贩卖资产阶级的私货。前几年更“破门而出”，写出了《海瑞罢官》，向党向社会主义发起嚣张之极的进攻。
    吴晗为什么敢如此肆无忌惮地反党呢？
    这是由吴晗的反动的阶级本质所决定的。毛主席说：“对于我们的国家抱着敌对情绪的知识分子，是极少数。这种人不喜欢我们这个无产阶级专政的国家，他们留恋旧社会。一遇机会，他们就会兴风作浪，想要推翻共产党，恢复旧中国。这是在无产阶级和资产阶级两条路线、社会主义和资本主义两条路线中间，顽固地要走后一条路线的人。……这是一些极端反动的人。”我们认为，吴晗正是这样的人！最近报刊上刊登的吴晗在解放前后的言论，雄辩地证明了吴晗从来就不是一个革命者，更不是什么“马克思主义历史学家”。他在六十年代走上反党反社会主义的道路决非偶然，正是他自己反动的资产阶级思想发展的必然结果。
    请看：在三十年代，在日寇侵华、民族存亡危急非常的时候，吴晗在干什么呢？他钻营于胡适之流的门下，恶意辱骂抗日救亡运动，为蒋介石的卖国投降政策效劳。他积极响应胡适提出的“整理国故”的反动主张，并且身体力行。胡适叫他“治明史”，他就一头扎进故纸堆，考证什么明太祖的生母，写什么《胡惟庸党案考》。这种对民族利益漠不关心的人，他身上有丝毫革命气味吗？
    在蒋介石极力赞扬明朝皇帝朱元璋，有意把自己比作朱元璋时，吴晗就连忙大写什么《明实录》、《明教与大明帝国》、《明太祖》等等，不一而足。他把朱元璋说成是“伟大的民族英雄”、“最伟大的军事统帅”、“最伟大的政治家”，借以把蒋介石捧上天。
    在蒋介石发动内战，妄图消灭共产党、消灭人民武装时，他就大写明王朝镇压农民起义经验教训，影射共产党和人民武装是“流寇”，要蒋介石吸取明王朝覆灭的教训，“用全力来消灭‘流寇’”。这种为蒋介石反共罪行出谋划策的人，还居然自称拥护共产党，“二十多年来……政治上的阶级立场是站稳了的。”这不是公开的骗人吗？吴晗“站稳了的”是反共的立场，而不是其它。
    全国解放以后，吴晗丝毫也没有改造自己的思想，他一直仇视党和社会主义。右倾机会主义者大肆反党时，吴晗又抬出明朝的地主官老爷海瑞来，不惜篡改历史，射出《海瑞骂皇帝》、《论海瑞》、《海瑞罢官》几根大毒箭，猖狂地反党反社会主义……这铁一般的事实，吴晗休想赖掉！它擦亮我们的眼睛，使我们认清吴晗原来是地主资产阶级的“历史家”，是反动阶级的“权威”，是他们的代言人。他研究历史不是为无产阶级的政治服务的，而是为地主资产阶级的政治服务的，是用来亲蒋、崇美、反共的！
    在一九六一年前后，我们国家遭受严重自然灾害，国民经济存在暂时的困难的时候，世界上帝国主义、修正主义、反动派，狼狈为奸，撤专家、撕合同、搞反攻，侵略我国西藏……搞得嚣张一时，天空上出现了几片乌云。国内右倾机会主义者乘机疯狂地向党进攻，闹得似乎不可一世。一切反动的人总是过高地估计自己的力量的。在这时，吴晗就以为天要变了，时机到了，于是
  “破门而出”，高举黑旗，猖狂地反党反社会主义！
    但是，吴晗想错了。历史是不依照吴晗的妄想而发展的。“搬起石头打自己的脚”，吴晗只能扮演悲剧的角色。我们在党和毛主席的英明领导下，进行了几十年的武装斗争、十几年的社会主义革命，积累了极其丰富的革命经验。那种披着马列主义外衣的东西，我们看得够多的了；那些借古骂今的东西，我们看得够多的了；那些不自量力，疯狂反党的东西，我们看得够多的了！我们的人民，是饱经风雨的人民，任何风险都吓不退我们！我们亲身体会到，只有跟着党、跟着毛主席走，才能胜利。吴晗的反动东西休想在我们这里通过，吴晗休想挖掉社会主义大厦上的一粒砂子。尤其重要的是我们有着战无不胜的毛泽东思想。近几年来，我们广大工农兵群众活学活用毛泽东思想，觉悟水平有了很大的提高。我们懂得什么是真马克思主义、什么是符合毛泽东思想的；什么是假马克思主义、什么是违反毛泽东思想的。吴晗就有那么两套伎俩，没什么了不起。不管他对自己的反动言行，怎样百般狡赖，掩盖，甚至反咬一口，我们是看得透的，我们是斗得倒他的！不是吗？吴晗那套反动的东西一露头，就遭到亿万用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民群众的痛歼！大家群起而攻之，吴晗的反动思想休想找到寄宿躲藏的地方！一切反动的东西都将被消灭，我们一定要粉碎吴晗的猖狂进攻！
    历史的列车正在隆隆前进。吴晗的反抗不过是螳臂当车，终将被历史的车轮碾得粉碎！
