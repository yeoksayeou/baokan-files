    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, 9th – According to Radio Pathet Lao: The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party issued a statement on the 8th, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys for their heinous crimes of spreading chemical poisons in the Laotian liberated areas and massacring the Laotian people.
    The statement said that in the three months since the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys launched a large-scale offensive against the Laotian liberated areas, they have continuously dispatched aircraft to carry out indiscriminate bombing; at the same time, they have also spread chemical poisons in many villages.
    The statement said that according to preliminary investigations by health cadres of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, the chemical poisons spread by the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys are highly toxic CN, DN, and CS, which have damaged many trees and crops, and some people have died from severe poisoning.
    The statement called on the governments of all countries, peace-loving and justice-upholding organizations, lawyers, scientists, and people of the world to join the Laotian people in protesting and denouncing the U.S. imperialist war of aggression against Laos, and to demand that the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys immediately cease their criminal actions of bombing, strafing, spreading chemical poisons, and massacring the Laotian people in the Laotian liberated areas.
    The statement emphasized that the U.S. imperialists and their servants must immediately cease the war of aggression against Laos, and must withdraw all their military personnel, weapons, and war materials from Laos. All problems of Laos must be solved by the Laotians themselves.
    The statement called on the Lao patriotic soldiers and civilians to maintain a high degree of vigilance against all the plots and tricks of the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, unite as one, and be determined to defeat the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys.
    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, 9th – According to Radio Pathet Lao on the 8th: From the beginning of December last year to the end of March this year, the patriotic army and people of Xieng Khouang Province, Laos, in the battles against the dry-season offensive launched by the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, annihilated a total of 932 enemies, of whom 724 were killed; captured 24 artillery pieces of various calibers, 126 light and heavy machine guns and other guns, and a large amount of war materials.
    According to another broadcast by the radio station: From March 11 to 29, guerrillas and people in Muang Son County, Sam Neua Province, Laos, eliminated 22 enemies in the bandit suppression operations.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 12th – The Vietnamese newspaper *Nhan Dan* published a commentary on the 12th, saying that the Vietnamese people resolutely support the statement issued on the 8th by the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys for their barbaric crimes of spreading chemical poisons in the Laotian liberated areas and massacring the Laotian people.
    The editorial said that this crime once again exposed the extremely reactionary, ugly, and despicable features of the common and irreconcilable enemy of the Laotian people and the people of the world, the war criminal – U.S. imperialism.
    The commentary said that this crazy action of the American aggressors does not indicate their strength, but on the contrary, exposes their failures and embarrassing situation. The United States and its lackeys have suffered one defeat after another in Laos over the past few years. More than 300 American planes have been shot down by the Laotian army and people, and the offensives of the United States and its lackeys against the liberated areas have been frustrated by the Laotian army and people. The heroic Lao army and people will surely smash all the sinister plots of the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys.

    老挝爱国战线党谴责美帝及其走狗撒放毒药屠杀人民
    川圹爱国军民四个月歼敌九百多
    新华社康开九日电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会八日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义和它的走狗对老挝解放区撒放化学毒药、屠杀老挝人民的滔天罪行。
    声明说，从美帝国主义和它的走狗对老挝解放区发动大规模进攻的三个多月来，它们不断派遣飞机对解放区进行狂轰滥炸；同时，还向许多村庄撒放化学毒药。
    声明说，根据老挝爱国战线党卫生干部的初步调查，由于美帝国主义和它的走狗撒放的化学毒药是具有强烈毒性的CN、DN和CS等，破坏了许多树木和庄稼，有的人因严重中毒而死亡。
    声明呼吁各国政府，世界各国爱好和平和主持正义的组织、律师、科学家和人民，同老挝人民一起同声抗议和控诉美帝国主义的侵略老挝的战争，要求美帝国主义及其走狗立即停止对老挝解放区进行轰炸、扫射和撒放化学毒药、屠杀老挝人民的罪恶行动。
    声明强调说，美帝国主义和它的仆从必须立即停止侵略老挝的战争，必须把它们的军事人员、武器和作战物资全部撤出老挝，老挝的一切问题必须让老挝人自己来解决。
    声明号召老挝爱国军民对美帝国主义和它的走狗的一切阴谋和手段保持高度警惕，团结一致，决心战胜美帝国主义和它的走狗。
    新华社康开九日电　据巴特寮电台八日广播：老挝川圹省爱国军民从去年十二月初到今年三月底，在反击美帝国主义和它的走狗军队发动的旱季进攻的战斗中，共消灭敌人九百三十二名，其中被打死的有七百二十四名；缴获各种口径的大炮二十四门，轻、重机枪等各种枪支一百二十六件和许多作战物资。
    另据这家电台广播：老挝桑怒省芒松县游击队和人民从三月十一日到二十九日在剿匪战斗中，消灭敌人二十二名。
    新华社河内十二日电　越南《人民报》十二日发表评论说，越南人民坚决支持老挝爱国战线党中央委员会八日的声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义和它的走狗对老挝解放区撒放化学毒药、屠杀老挝人民的野蛮罪行。
    社论说，这一罪行再一次暴露了老挝人民和世界人民共同的不共戴天的敌人、战争罪犯——美帝国主义的极其反动、丑恶和卑鄙的嘴脸。
    评论说，美国侵略者的这个疯狂行动，并不表明他们的强大，相反，却暴露了他们的失败和狼狈处境。美国及其走狗几年来在老挝遭到了一个又一个的失败，三百多架美国飞机被老挝军民击落，美国及其走狗对解放区的进攻都被老挝军民挫败。英雄的老挝军民必将粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗的一切恶毒阴谋。
