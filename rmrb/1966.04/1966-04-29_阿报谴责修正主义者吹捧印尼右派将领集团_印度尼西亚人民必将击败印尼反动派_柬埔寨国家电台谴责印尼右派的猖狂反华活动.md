　　Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, April 24 – The Albanian newspaper *Bashkimi* published a commentary on the 24th, stating that the Indonesian people, under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, will certainly overcome temporary obstacles and difficulties and ultimately defeat the counter-revolution.

　　The commentary pointed out that the more the right-wing general clique that seized power in Indonesia ruthlessly suppresses the Indonesian people and frantically opposes China, the more American imperialism strengthens its cooperation with it and the more aid it provides.

　　The commentary said that the imperialist ruling groups in Washington, London, and Tokyo applauded the fascist military coup in Indonesia, thus exposing their relationship with the Indonesian right-wing fascist general clique in front of world public opinion.

　　The commentary said that modern revisionists have now shifted from attacking and slandering the Indonesian Communist Party to praising the fascist general clique.

　　The commentary said that the aim of the crusade of imperialism and modern revisionism is to pull the Indonesian fascist generals out of the quagmire, to cover up the counter-revolutionary acts and fascist terror in Indonesia with a smokescreen, and to turn the country into another base against peace-loving countries and the Asian national liberation movement, especially into a hotbed against the People's Republic of China.

　　*Zëri i Popullit* also published a commentary on the same day, stating that Washington has been constantly applauding since the right-wing reactionary general clique in Indonesia launched a coup last October. The Indonesian right-wing forces are further throwing themselves into the embrace of American imperialism, obtaining American economic "aid" and will receive loans and investments.

　　The commentary pointed out, however, that the American imperialists and their friends are rejoicing too soon. The Indonesian people are a great people with glorious revolutionary traditions. There is no doubt that the Indonesian people will burn down this small group of reactionaries who have seized power and will continue to advance along the revolutionary road of Indonesia.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, April 27 – Cambodian National Radio broadcast a commentary on the 26th, pointing out that anti-China activities are being carried out frantically and systematically in Jakarta. "Some universally recognized norms of international law have been repeatedly and deliberately and seriously violated. It is intolerable that foreign diplomats have been harmed again and again by frenzied demonstrators."

　　The radio station said that the current rampant atrocities against overseas Chinese and Chinese property in Jakarta would lead to a lawless situation.

　　The commentary pointed out: "Obviously, this situation will only benefit the American imperialists, fuel their conspiracies, and bolster the arrogant beliefs recently expressed by Humphrey, who said that the United States 'will stay in Asia for a long, very long time.'"

    阿报谴责修正主义者吹捧印尼右派将领集团
    印度尼西亚人民必将击败印尼反动派
    柬埔寨国家电台谴责印尼右派的猖狂反华活动
    新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》二十四日发表评论说，印度尼西亚人民在印度尼西亚共产党的领导下，一定能够克服暂时的障碍和困难，最后击败反革命。
    评论指出，攫取了印度尼西亚政权的右派将领集团越是残酷镇压印度尼西亚人民，越是疯狂反华，美帝国主义同它的合作就越加强，给予它的援助也就越多。
    评论说，华盛顿、伦敦和东京等帝国主义统治集团为印度尼西亚的法西斯军事政变鼓掌，这样，就在世界公众舆论面前，暴露了他们同印度尼西亚右派法西斯将领集团的关系。
    评论说，现代修正主义者现在已经从对印度尼西亚共产党的攻击、诬蔑转到了对法西斯将领集团的吹捧。
    评论说，帝国主义和现代修正主义的十字军的目的在于把印度尼西亚法西斯将领从泥坑中拉出来，给在印度尼西亚的反革命行为和法西斯恐怖遮上一层烟幕，并把这个国家变成另一个反对爱好和平国家和亚洲民族解放运动的基地，特别是变成一个反对中华人民共和国的温床。
    《战士报》也在同一天发表评论说，自从去年十月印度尼西亚右派反动将领集团发动政变以来，华盛顿就不断拍手称好。印度尼西亚右派势力正在进一步投向美帝国主义的怀抱，取得了美国的经济“援助”、并将得到贷款和投资。
    评论指出，但是，美帝国主义者及其朋友高兴得太早了。印度尼西亚人民是伟大的人民，具有光荣的革命传统。毫无疑问，印度尼西亚人民必将烧毁这一小撮攫取了政权的反动派，并将继续沿着印度尼西亚的革命道路前进。
    新华社金边二十七日电　柬埔寨国家电台二十六日发表评论指出，在雅加达正在猖狂地、有计划地进行反华活动。“普遍公认的国际法的一些准则一再遭到蓄意的、极其严重的破坏。外国外交官员一而再再而三地遭到疯狂的示威者的伤害，这是不能容许的。”
    这家电台说，目前在雅加达对华侨和中国财产的那种暴行的泛滥，会导致无法无天的局面。
    评论指出：“显然，这种情况只会有利于美帝国主义者，助长他们的阴谋勾当，并且给汉弗莱最近所表示的狂妄信念助威，他说美国‘将长期地、非常长期地呆在亚洲’。”
