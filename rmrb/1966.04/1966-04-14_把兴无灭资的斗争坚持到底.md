    Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" uses Hai Rui's body to speak Wu Han's words. It is a thoroughly poisonous weed against the Party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought.
    With the deepening development of the socialist revolution, class enemies have launched a sharp struggle against us. Taking advantage of our country's temporary economic difficulties, they frantically opposed the Three Red Banners. They said that the people's communes were a mess, advocated "San Zi Yi Bao," and stirred up a wave of individual farming, launching a comprehensive attack on our Party's guidelines and policies. This was a struggle between two classes and two roads. It was at this time that Comrade Wu Han vigorously promoted the "honest official" Hai Rui. In exploitative class society, how could there be any "honest officials"! So-called "honest officials" are not also feudal bureaucrats who maintain the interests of the exploiting classes through various methods and disguises? So why did Wu Han take so much trouble to beautify Hai Rui? The drunkard's intention is not in the wine. His real purpose is to attack the Party from the standpoint of right-leaning opportunists through Hai Rui's mouth. When right-leaning opportunism had just emerged, he added fuel to the fire by "scolding" the emperor. And when right-leaning opportunists were defeated by the Party, he wanted right-leaning opportunists to learn from Hai Rui's spirit of not being afraid of setbacks, not being afraid of sacrifice, and "trying again after failure," encouraging right-leaning opportunists to persevere in their struggle. Everyone can see how well Comrade Wu Han coordinated with the right-leaning opportunists. He was also using the past to serve the present, launching an attack on the Party, on socialism, and on Mao Zedong Thought under the guise of academic research. We must expose his disguise and resolutely struggle against his reactionary ideas.
    Comrade Wu Han actually uses "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" to put lipstick on the exploiting classes. He says that in feudal society, there were also bureaucrats who served the interests of the people and spoke out for the people's grievances. This is nonsense. Since ancient times, it has never been heard that landlords and capitalists thought of the people. All crows are black, and all rulers are bloodsuckers of the working people. In the old society, my grandfather fled from inside the pass to outside the pass begging for food, and was exploited and oppressed by landlords in the countryside, and exploited and oppressed by capitalists in the city. My grandfather and father worked as shop assistants for capitalists for two generations, but what they got in return was beatings and scoldings, and the risk of unemployment during festivals, not enough to eat, not enough to wear, and cruel exploitation and oppression. There is no such thing as the exploiting class speaking for the working people, there is no such thing as the exploiting class standing on the same position as the working people.
    Chairman Mao taught us in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" that "The struggle in the ideological field between socialism and capitalism in our country will still take a very long time to decide the issue. This is because the influence of the bourgeoisie and of the intellectuals coming from the old society will remain in our country for a long time, and so will their ideology as a class. If we fail to understand this, or still worse, fail to understand it at all, we shall commit the gravest mistakes and ignore the necessity of waging the struggle in the ideological field." Analyzing Wu Han's works with Chairman Mao's viewpoint on class struggle makes the issue clear. This makes me love Chairman Mao even more, and prompts me to work harder to study Chairman Mao's works and constantly enhance my awareness of class and class struggle. We must never put down the weapon of class struggle, but must firmly grasp the gun of class struggle, fight against the enemies with guns, and also fight against bourgeois ideology, until complete victory. In the struggle, resolutely read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

    把兴无灭资的斗争坚持到底
    哈尔滨市第七商店副政治指导员　魏淑琴
    吴晗同志的《海瑞罢官》，是借海瑞的躯壳，说吴晗的话，是一株反对党、反对社会主义、反对毛泽东思想的彻头彻尾的大毒草。
    随着社会主义革命的深入发展，阶级敌人向我们进行了尖锐的斗争。他们乘我国在经济上的暂时困难时期，猖狂地反对三面红旗。说什么人民公社搞糟了，提倡“三自一包”，刮起一股单干风，对我们党的方针、政策进行了全面的攻击。这是一场两个阶级、两条道路的斗争。正是在这时候，吴晗同志大肆宣扬“清官”海瑞。在剥削阶级社会那有什么“清官”！所谓“清官”，不也是通过各种办法，采取各种伪装，维护剥削阶级利益的封建官僚吗？那么为什么吴晗这样煞费苦心地美化海瑞呢？醉翁之意不在酒。他的真实目的是通过海瑞的嘴，站在右倾机会主义者的立场向党进攻。当右倾机会主义刚刚出笼时，他用“骂”皇帝来火上加油。而当右倾机会主义分子被党击败，他又要右倾机会主义分子学习海瑞的不怕挫折，不怕牺牲，“失败了再干”的精神。鼓励右倾机会主义者坚持斗争。大家看，吴晗同志和右倾机会主义者配合得多么协调。他这也是古为今用，披着学术研究的外衣，向党、向社会主义、向毛泽东思想进攻。我们要揭开他的伪装，同他的反动思想坚决进行斗争。
    吴晗同志实际上通过《海瑞罢官》为剥削阶级涂脂抹粉。他说，在封建社会，还有为人民利益服务，为人民喊冤的官僚。这是一派胡说。自古以来，从未听说过有为人民着想的地主和资本家。天下乌鸦一般黑，所有的统治者都是劳动人民的吸血虫。旧社会，我的祖父由关里要饭逃到关外，在农村受地主的剥削和压迫，逃到城市受资本家的剥削和压迫。我祖父和父亲给资本家当了两代店员，可是换来的是挨打受骂，逢年过节都有失业的危险，吃不饱，穿不暖，受着残酷的剥削和压迫。那有剥削阶级替劳动人民讲话的事，那有同劳动人民站在一个立场上的剥削阶级。
    毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》一文中教导我们“我国社会主义和资本主义之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负的斗争，还需要一个相当长的时间才能解决。这是因为资产阶级和从旧社会来的知识分子的影响还要在我国长期存在，作为阶级的意识形态，还要在我国长期存在。如果对于这种形势认识不足，或者根本不认识，那就要犯绝大的错误，就会忽视必要的思想斗争。”用毛主席关于阶级斗争的观点来分析吴晗的作品，问题就一清二楚。这使我更加热爱毛主席，促使自己更加努力去学习毛主席著作，不断增强阶级和阶级斗争的观念。我们决不能放下阶级斗争的武器，而要紧握阶级斗争这杆枪，同拿枪的敌人斗争，也同资产阶级思想斗争，直到彻底胜利。在斗争中，坚决读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。
