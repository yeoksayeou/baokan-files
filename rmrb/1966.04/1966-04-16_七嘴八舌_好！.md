　　“七嘴八舌”好！
　　朱润林
　　上海有个弄堂工厂，增产节约运动搞得热火朝天，产量一增再增，质量好上加好。前往取经的人可真不少。
　　有的人看到这个厂生产搞的这么好，便问这个厂的领导：“你们一定有什么绝招吧！”这个厂的领导回答道：“我们什么绝招也没有，全靠职工‘七嘴八舌’地提办法，‘七手八脚’地实际干。”
　　有人一想到“七嘴八舌”，就和人多语杂，吵吵嚷嚷联系起来。一想到“七手八脚”，就和做事忙乱，没有秩序联系起来。“七嘴八舌”，“七手八脚”，不要吵翻了天，乱了套么？要不得，学不得。其实，这种旧想法，才是真正要不得的。
　　根据这个工厂的经验来看，只有放手发动群众，才能真正地把增产节约运动推向高潮。原因很简单：直接参加生产实践的工人，对生产中存在的问题看得最清楚，对增产的潜力心里最有底。
　　“七嘴八舌”的议论过程，就是集中群众智慧的过程。这个办法就是“群言堂”。它不会吵翻了天，只会吵翻了“一言堂”，吵翻了洋框框和旧框框，实在是好得很。
　　“七手八脚”地干，就是群众充分发挥聪明才干的过程。干革命，搞建设，不能靠少数人冷冷清清地闷头干，要靠广大群众轰轰烈烈、热气腾腾地大干。这是搞好增产节约运动的最牢靠的办法，绝不会“乱了套”的。
　　职工群众大闹增产节约运动，要统一于一个指导思想之下，这就是毛泽东思想。只要我们突出政治，以毛泽东思想武装职工头脑，“七嘴八舌”和“七手八脚”，就一定能把增产节约运动搞好！

"Many Tongues and Hands" is Good!
Zhu Runlin
In Shanghai, there is a lane factory where the increase production and practice economy movement is in full swing. The output is increasing again and again, and the quality is getting better and better. There are really many people who go to learn from their experience.
Some people see that the factory's production is so good, so they ask the factory's leaders, "You must have some unique skills!" The leaders of the factory replied: "We have no unique skills. We rely entirely on the workers to offer solutions with 'many tongues and hands' and actually do it with 'many hands and feet.'"
Some people associate "many tongues and hands" with many people talking at once, being noisy and quarrelsome. When they think of "many hands and feet", they associate it with being busy and chaotic, without order. "Many tongues and hands," "many hands and feet," won't it lead to chaos? It's undesirable and can't be learned from. In fact, this old idea is really undesirable.
According to the experience of this factory, only by boldly mobilizing the masses can the increase production and practice economy movement be truly pushed to a climax. The reason is very simple: the workers who directly participate in production practice can see the problems existing in production most clearly, and they have the most confidence in the potential for increasing production.
The process of "many tongues and hands" discussion is the process of concentrating the wisdom of the masses. This method is "collective discussion". It will not lead to chaos, but will only overturn "one person has the say", overturn foreign constraints and old constraints, which is really good.
Doing things with "many hands and feet" is the process of the masses fully exerting their intelligence and talents. To engage in revolution and construction, we cannot rely on a few people doing it quietly and silently; we must rely on the broad masses to work vigorously and enthusiastically. This is the most reliable way to do a good job in the increase production and practice economy movement, and it will never "lead to chaos."
The workers and masses are making a big effort in the increase production and practice economy movement, which must be unified under a guiding ideology, which is Mao Zedong Thought. As long as we highlight politics and arm the minds of workers with Mao Zedong Thought, "many tongues and hands" and "many hands and feet" will surely make the increase production and practice economy movement a success!

    职工群众大闹增产节约运动，要统一于一个指导思想之下，这就是毛泽东思想。只要我们突出政治，以毛泽东思想武装职工头脑，“七嘴八舌”和“七手八脚”，就一定能把增产节约运动搞好！
