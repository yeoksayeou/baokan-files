    Viewing Two Management Philosophies from Several Transactions
    Staff of Hailun County Production Materials Procurement and Supply Station Improve Understanding Through Debate
    (Our Dispatch) Staff of the Hailun County Production Materials Procurement and Supply Station in Heilongjiang Province, recently conducted a discussion on the relationship between politics and business, clarifying the principle that politics commands business.
    The discussion began as follows: One day, a comrade from this station raised an opinion to the Party branch: "If we always focus on politics, can business develop?" This opinion reflected the long-standing argument of some employees in the station: that grasping politics does not necessarily lead to the completion of tasks. Therefore, the Party branch organized all employees to conduct a discussion. At the discussion, some people said: "Political work is intangible, while business work is tangible. Talking too much about great political principles will squeeze out precious business working time." Others said: "As long as we do a good job in business, we don't have to worry about not being able to complete the target tasks."
    Many people presented facts to criticize these statements. Someone said that our production materials station bought a batch of breeding donkeys from Shaanxi for the production teams last year, which was originally a great thing to do for agriculture, but because we had serious capitalist management ideas, we added more than one hundred yuan to each donkey, increasing the financial burden on the production teams. Can this be considered completing the task of serving agriculture? Later, we studied Chairman Mao's writings and realized our mistake, returning the overcharged money to the production teams.
    Others said that if we do not give prominence to politics and only focus on business, even if the target tasks can be completed, they may not be completed well. For example, the plow beams needed for agricultural production, we had a lot of them in the station, and the production teams also needed them, but they didn't come to buy them. Why? It is because we lacked the idea of serving agriculture in our minds. Knowing that there was a problem with the curvature of these plow beams, we didn't improve them according to the farmers' opinions, resulting in an accumulation of more than 3,200 pieces over three years. This year, our management thinking has been corrected, and after repairing these plow beams, we have already sold more than 2,000 pieces.
    The conclusion everyone drew from these experiences and lessons is that there is a struggle between two management philosophies and two roads in enterprises at all times. To run a socialist enterprise well, we must give prominence to proletarian politics, rely on Mao Zedong Thought to take command, and rely on the advanced thinking of the people.

    从几笔买卖看两种经营思想
    海伦县生产资料采购供应站职工从辩论中提高了认识
    本报讯　黑龙江省海伦县生产资料采购供应站职工，最近就政治和业务关系的问题开展了一场讨论，明确认识了政治统帅业务的道理。
    讨论是这样开始的：一天，这个站的一位同志向党支部提出了一条意见：“老抓政治，业务能开展起来吗？”这个意见反映了站里一些职工长期以来就有的论调：抓政治不一定能完成任务。于是，党支部组织全站职工开展了讨论。在讨论会上，有人说：“政治工作是虚的，业务工作是实的，多谈政治上的大道理，就会挤掉宝贵的业务工作时间。”也有人说：“只要抓好业务，就不愁不能完成指标任务。”
    许多人摆出事实，批判了这些说法。有人说，我们生产资料站，去年从陕西给生产队买回一批种驴，本来是为农业办的一件大好事，可是由于我们有严重的资本主义经营思想，一头驴多加了一百多元钱，给生产队增大了费用开支。这能算完成为农业服务的任务么？后来，我们学习了毛主席著作，才认识到做错了，把多要的钱给生产队退了回去。
    还有人说，如果不突出政治，单抓业务，就是可能完成的指标任务，也不一定能完成得好。比如，农业生产需要的犁辕子，我们站里存了很多，生产队也很需要，可是他们不来买。为什么呢？就是因为我们脑袋里缺少为农业服务的思想，明知道这些犁辕子的弯度有问题，也不按农民的意见加以改进，结果三年来积压了三千二百多根。今年我们的经营思想端正了，把这些犁辕子加以修理，已经卖出了二千多根。
    大家从这些经验教训里得出的结论是：企业里随时存在两种经营思想、两条道路的斗争，要办好社会主义企业，必须突出无产阶级政治，靠毛泽东思想挂帅，靠人的先进思想。
