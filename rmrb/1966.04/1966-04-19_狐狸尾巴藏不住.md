    The Fox's Tail Can't Be Hidden
    Zhang Junming, Worker at the Coal Washing Plant of Tangshan Mine, Kailuan Coal Mine

    During this period, the articles published in the newspapers regarding the criticism of Comrade Wu Han's "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" attracted the attention of many workers in our coal washing plant. Everyone discussed them enthusiastically, and we gained a further understanding of Comrade Wu Han's reactionary political and academic viewpoints.

    First of all, Comrade Wu Han stood on the opposite side of our working class in terms of political stance. He was supporting the right-leaning opportunists by advocating Hai Rui's "unyielding integrity" and "dismissal from office." On the one hand, he was pleading for those right-leaning opportunists who had been "dismissed" from "office"; on the other hand, he was encouraging them to launch frantic attacks on the Party, the people, and socialism. His "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" encouraged all monsters and demons to muster their courage and recklessly scold the Party and socialism. Therefore, Comrade Wu Han's reactionary political viewpoint was extremely insidious and could be seen through at a glance.

    In academic research, we can see that Wu Han often puts on the airs of an "authority," intimidating us and speaking in roundabout ways about many things. To put it bluntly, his "making the past serve the present" was nothing more than dressing up the reactionary Hai Rui as a "savior" of the people, as an image of the right-leaning opportunists, wanting people to learn their kind of "fighting spirit" against the Party and against socialism. However, Comrade Wu Han miscalculated; the fox's tail cannot be hidden. The working people of the socialist era are not so easily deceived. With the weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, no matter how fancy the bourgeois academic viewpoints are dressed up, we can see through them at a glance.

    The worker-peasant-soldier masses have already entered a new historical era of mastering Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Since Comrade Wu Han launched an attack on the proletariat from the ideological front, we must rise up and fight back.

    狐狸尾巴藏不住
    开滦煤矿唐山矿洗煤厂工人　张俊明
    这一时期，报纸上发表的有关批判吴晗同志的《海瑞骂皇帝》、《海瑞罢官》的文章，引起了我们洗煤厂很多工人的注意。大家热烈地议论着，对吴晗同志的反动政治观点和学术观点，有了进一步认识。
    首先，吴晗同志在政治立场上和我们工人阶级站在对立的一面，他是借着宣扬海瑞的“刚直不阿”和“罢官”，替右倾机会主义分子撑腰。一方面，替被“罢”了“官”的右倾机会主义分子诉冤喊屈；一方面，又鼓励他们向党向人民向社会主义疯狂进攻。他的《海瑞骂皇帝》，就鼓励一切牛鬼蛇神壮起胆子，放肆骂党骂社会主义。所以，吴晗同志的这种反动政治观点，十分阴险，一眼就可以看穿。
    在学术研究上，我们可以看出吴晗经常是端着“权威”的架子，吓唬我们，转弯拐角说了很多东西。说穿了，他的“古为今用”，无非是把反动透顶的海瑞装扮成人民的“救星”，作为右倾机会主义分子的形象，要人家学习他们那种反党反社会主义的“战斗精神”。可是，吴晗同志打算错了，狐狸的尾巴是藏不住的。社会主义时代的劳动人民不是那样容易受蒙骗的，我们有了毛泽东思想的武器，资产阶级学术观点装扮得再花梢一些，我们也能一眼看穿。
    工农兵群众已经进入掌握马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的历史新时代，吴晗同志既然从意识形态上向无产阶级发动了进攻，我们就要奋起应战。
