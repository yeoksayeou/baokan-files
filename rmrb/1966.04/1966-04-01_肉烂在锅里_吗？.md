	"Does 'Meat Rot in the Pot'?"
	Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant　Wang Enxi
	During the increase production and practice economy movement, I heard the following saying: "The factory is so big, wasting a bit doesn't matter, anyway 'meat rots in the pot'." The idea is that no matter how much is bought from the market, or how much is taken from the warehouse, and no matter whether it is actually used or not, it hasn't left the factory gates.
	This saying may seem to make some sense, but it is actually completely wrong. A few days ago, our factory carried out a "treasure hunt" activity, collecting steel, iron, coal, coke, wood, and other materials that had been thrown away in the past. On the first day, we collected a lot of "treasures," including metal materials, furnace materials, and fuels... The next day, we dug less than two shovel-depths down a small slope and discovered a "underground coke depot," more than half a foot thick with coke. Look, these "meat" – metal materials and fuel – are still in the "pot," but if we don't dig them out, wouldn't they be "rotted" for nothing! The "meat" is still in the "pot," but it's "rotten," so what good is it! "Meat rotting in the pot" causes serious waste and causes great damage to state property. The saying "anyway meat rots in the pot" is essentially a manifestation of the young master's ideological style. This is not the thought that the working class should have. Let us quickly throw it away!

### “肉烂在锅里”吗？

    “肉烂在锅里”吗？
    北京第一机床厂　王恩熙
    在增产节约运动中，听到这样一种说法：“厂子这么大，浪费点算不了什么，反正‘肉烂在锅里’。”意思是说，不管是从市场上多买进来，还是从仓库里多领出去，也不管是真使用上了，还是没用上，反正是没跑出工厂的大门。
    这种说法，听来似乎有点道理，实际上是完全错误的。前几天，我们厂里开展了一个把以往扔掉的钢、铁、煤、焦炭、木材等拣回来的“拣宝”活动。第一天，就拣回来很多的“宝”，有金属材料，也有炉料、燃料……。第二天，我们从一块小坡地上往下挖不到两锹深，就发现了“地下焦炭库”一座，半尺多厚都是焦炭。请看，这些“肉”——金属材料和燃料虽然还都在“锅里”，但如果不把它们挖出来，不就等于白白“烂”掉了吗！“肉”还在“锅里”，可是“烂”掉了，那又有什么用呢！“肉烂在锅里”，就造成严重的浪费，使国家财产遭受到很大的损失。“反正肉烂在锅里”的说法，实质上是大少爷思想作风的表现，这不是工人阶级应有的思想，让我们赶快把它抛掉吧！
