　　The Indonesian government is the Organizer of Anti-China Atrocities
　　Following the attack on the Chinese Embassy in Jakarta by the Indonesian armed forces in collusion with thugs, within a short span of more than a week, serious incidents of destruction and seizure of the Commercial Counselor's Office of the Chinese Embassy, the office and residence of the Chinese Consulate General, the Military Attaché's Office of the Chinese Embassy, and the Embassy's residence have occurred successively. This is clearly a planned action taken by the Indonesian government to completely rupture diplomatic relations between the two countries.
　　After organizing and instructing thugs to commit these appalling anti-China atrocities, the Indonesian government has attempted to shirk its responsibility. Foreign Minister Malik and other officials have vehemently denied that these atrocities were directed by the Indonesian government, claiming that China's accusations are "groundless" and that the Indonesian government "resolutely rejects" them. The Indonesian right-wing military clique believes that as long as they desperately deny it, they can absolve themselves completely. Frankly, this is absolutely impossible.
　　People have seen that all these anti-China atrocities were carried out under the leadership or in coordination with the Indonesian military and police. The thugs attacking the Chinese Embassy not only received the support of a large number of military and police but were also assisted by armored vehicles. Their destruction and occupation of the Commercial Counselor's Office and the Military Attaché's Office of the Chinese Embassy were carried out in collaboration with the armed forces of the Siliwangi Division.
　　People have seen that the thugs, in staging their fascist farce of all-out violence, did not conceal who their director was. They shouted: "Uncle Suharto told us to smash the Chinese Embassy." They clamored: "We are here to take over the Chinese Consulate General under the orders of Uncle Amir, Commander of the Fifth Military Region."
　　People have also seen that Malik, the Indonesian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, not only delivered speeches inciting anti-China sentiment at an anti-China rally held before the thugs attacked the Chinese Embassy but also received representatives of the attacking thugs after the incident and greatly commended them. He openly defended this fascist atrocity, saying that what is happening now "is only an expression of the people's anger" and "is very natural." Indonesian Deputy Foreign Minister Suwito also openly declared that the thugs who seized the office and residence of the Chinese Embassy and Consulate General were "revolutionary" and "progressive" youth.
　　Irrefutable facts prove that the Indonesian government is the organizer and director of a series of anti-China atrocities, including the attack on the Chinese Embassy, and is the culprit responsible for the bloody crime of injuring and shooting Chinese diplomatic officials. Even the Japan Broadcasting Corporation radio station said that the attack on the Chinese Embassy "was carried out with the support or even tacit consent of the military and government." The evidence is conclusive and undeniable!
　　Admittedly, among the thugs participating in the anti-China atrocities, there are members of organizations such as the "Indonesian University Students' United Action Organization." They are merely the henchmen of the Indonesian right-wing military clique and are completely obedient to the right-wing military clique. The leading right-wing generals constantly encourage them and support them. Just before and after the reactionary thugs repeatedly attacked and destroyed Chinese diplomatic missions, Nasution, when meeting with a group of thugs, also instructed them to "maintain unity with the Indonesian Republic Armed Forces and fight together." Suharto, at a rally of the right-wing organization "Indonesian University Students' United Action Organization," called on them to "especially cooperate with the armed forces." Who is directing this group of thugs, driving them to carry out rampant anti-China activities? Isn't this crystal clear?
　　The Indonesian government is intensifying the creation of anti-China fascist atrocities, determined to push relations between the two countries to a complete rupture. But it is also desperately denying it, not daring to take responsibility for rupturing relations between the two countries. This approach does not in the slightest demonstrate any cleverness in their methods but rather shows that they are outwardly fierce but inwardly weak. We want to tell the Indonesian government: in the face of ironclad evidence, your denials are useless. You must bear full responsibility for the crimes of the anti-China atrocities!

### 印度尼西亚政府是反华暴行的组织者

    印度尼西亚政府是反华暴行的组织者	本报评论员
    继印度尼西亚武装部队伙同暴徒袭击中国驻雅加达大使馆后，在短短一个多星期内，又连续发生了中国大使馆商务参赞处、中国总领事馆办公处和宿舍、中国大使馆武官处以及大使馆宿舍被破坏和强占的严重事件。这显然是印度尼西亚政府为了完全破裂两国外交关系而采取的有计划的行动。
    印度尼西亚政府在组织和指使暴徒干出了这些骇人听闻的反华暴行以后，却妄图推脱罪责。外交部长马利克和其他官员，矢口否认这些暴行是印度尼西亚政府指挥的，说什么中国的指责“没有根据”，印度尼西亚政府“坚决拒绝”。印度尼西亚右派军人集团以为只要拼命抵赖，就可以使自己落个一干二净。老实说，这是绝对办不到的。
    人们看到，所有这些反华暴行都是在印度尼西亚军警的带领或配合下干出来的。暴徒们袭击中国大使馆，不仅得到大批军警的支援，而且得到装甲车的配合。他们破坏和占领中国大使馆商务参赞处、武官处，是由西利万吉师的武装部队协同进行的。
    人们看到，暴徒们在演出全武行的法西斯丑剧时，并不隐讳他们的导演是谁。他们高呼：“苏哈托伯伯叫我们捣毁中国大使馆。”他们叫嚷：“我们是奉第五军区司令阿米尔伯伯的命令来接管中国总领事馆。”
    人们还看到，身为印度尼西亚副总理兼外交部长的马利克，不但在暴徒们袭击中国大使馆前举行的反华集会上，发表煽动反华的讲话，而且在事件发生后，接见行凶暴徒代表，大为嘉奖。他公然为这种法西斯暴行辩解，说目前发生的事情“只是人民愤怒情绪的一种表现”，“是很自然的”。印度尼西亚外交部副部长苏维托也公然宣称，强占中国大使馆和总领事馆办公处及宿舍的暴徒是“革命的”“进步的”青年。
    无可辩驳的事实证明，印度尼西亚政府是袭击中国大使馆等一系列反华暴行的组织者和指挥者，是犯下打伤和枪伤中国外交官员血腥罪行的罪魁祸首。就连日本广播协会电台也说，袭击中国大使馆“是在军方和政府的支持乃至默认之下进行的”。铁证如山，岂容抵赖！
    诚然，在参加反华暴行的暴徒中间，有什么“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动组织”之类的成员。他们只不过是印度尼西亚右派军人集团的打手，是完全听命于右派军人集团的。右派将领头目不断为他们打气，替他们撑腰。就在最近反动暴徒接连袭击和破坏中国外交代表机构的前后，纳苏蒂安接见一批暴徒时，还叮嘱他们“保持同印度尼西亚共和国武装部队的团结，共同奋斗”。苏哈托在右派团体“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动组织”的一次集会上，号召他们“特别要同武装部队进行合作”。是谁在指挥这批打手，驱使他们进行猖狂的反华活动，这难道不是一清二楚的吗？
    印度尼西亚政府变本加厉地制造反华法西斯暴行，决心把两国关系推向完全的破裂。但是它又百般抵赖，不敢承担破裂两国关系的责任。这种做法，丝毫也不表明它们的手法有什么高明之处，而是说明它们色厉内荏，虚弱得很。我们要告诉印度尼西亚政府：在铁的罪证面前，你们的抵赖是毫无用处的。你们必须对反华暴行的罪责承担全部责任！
