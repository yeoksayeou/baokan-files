    Emphasizing Politics in Higher Education by Studying and Applying Chairman Mao's Works
    The Transformation of Intellectuals' Worldview Must Be Placed in a Primary Position
    A Symposium of Leading Cadres from Higher Education Institutions Directly Under the Ministry of Higher Education Pointed Out: If Proletarian Politics Are Not Emphasized in Higher Education, It Will Cultivate Bourgeois Spiritual Aristocrats and Become a Social Foundation for Revisionism.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, April 10th – The Party Committee of the Ministry of Higher Education recently held a symposium in Jinan, Shandong, for leading cadres of directly affiliated higher education institutions. The symposium concluded that the higher education front must further emphasize politics, organize faculty, students, and staff to more widely and deeply carry out the movement of studying Chairman Mao’s works, and vigorously promote the revolution in higher education and the ideological transformation of intellectuals. The symposium emphasized that the key to emphasizing politics on the higher education front lies in leading cadres at all levels taking the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works in a living way.
    The symposium believed that in recent years, the consciousness of faculty, students, and staff in higher education institutions to study Chairman Mao’s works has been continuously improving, and a number of advanced units and individuals who have studied and applied Chairman Mao’s works in a living way have emerged. They have achieved certain results in transforming their worldviews, carrying out educational revolution, engaging in scientific research, and performing general affairs and logistics work. The overall situation on the higher education front is good. However, compared with advanced units, higher education departments and institutions are still in a relatively backward state in studying Chairman Mao’s works, which is not in line with the current upsurge in socialist revolution and socialist construction.
    Participants in the symposium focused on studying Chairman Mao’s "Speech at the National Propaganda Work Conference of the Communist Party of China" and instructions on emphasizing politics, democratic centralism, and other issues. The meeting pointed out that further emphasizing politics, studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works in a living way, and using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, transform everything, and promote everything is the fundamental task of all higher education institutions nationwide.
    The meeting believed that Comrade Lin Biao’s five principles for emphasizing politics are equally applicable to higher education institutions and must be resolutely implemented. In higher education institutions, many people still have erroneous understandings of the relationship between politics and professional work. They either oppose politics to professional work, or juxtapose politics with professional work, or say "politics takes command" in words, but actually do "professional work takes command." Attendees unanimously agreed that a serious and in-depth discussion on the relationship between politics and professional work must be carried out in higher education institutions. Through discussion, the faculty, students, and staff should more deeply understand the importance of emphasizing politics and using politics to command professional work.
    The symposium, after reviewing the several ideological remolding movements experienced by intellectuals in higher education institutions since liberation, pointed out that higher education institutions are places where intellectuals are concentrated. Many people received bourgeois education in the old society, and many people deal with feudal and capitalist cultural heritage every day. Bourgeois ideology constantly influences them. Although China’s higher education institutions have carried out many ideological remolding movements, and intellectuals have made considerable progress, for the majority of people, the problem of establishing a proletarian communist worldview has not been fundamentally resolved. The proletariat wants to transform the world according to its own worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to transform the world according to its own worldview. Therefore, in higher education institutions, the struggle between the two roads, the two worldviews, the struggle to promote the proletariat and eliminate the bourgeoisie, and the struggle to win over the younger generation are long-term, complex, and sometimes very fierce. This is the most fundamental contradiction in higher education institutions. Are higher education institutions cultivating successors to the proletariat, or successors to the bourgeoisie? Is education work promoting the narrowing and even elimination of the three differences, or deepening and widening the three differences? Is it running universities according to the framework of capitalism and revisionism, or resolutely taking our own path? This is the fundamental direction issue that determines whether China’s higher education is socialist or capitalist in nature. If proletarian politics are not emphasized in higher education institutions, it will cultivate bourgeois spiritual aristocrats and become a social foundation for revisionism.
    The meeting believed that educators must first be educated. Only with revolutionary people and revolutionary ideas can revolutionary higher education be run. In higher education institutions, emphasizing politics and studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works in a living way must place the transformation of intellectuals' worldviews in a primary position. They believed that the gap between intellectuals and workers and peasants in studying Chairman Mao’s works ultimately lies in the word "application." To eliminate this gap, efforts must be made in the word "application." First, it must be used to transform the worldview, and second, it must be used to solve various practical problems in professional work with Mao Zedong Thought. Transforming the subjective world in the process of transforming the objective world, and using the transformation of the subjective world to promote the transformation of the objective world, this is a dialectical process of matter transforming into spirit, and spirit transforming into matter. The meeting believed that the movement to study Chairman Mao’s works should be transformed into a mass rectification movement, a conscious ideological transformation movement, on the higher education front. In the process of study, the following issues should be focused on discussing and resolving: First, in the relationship between politics and professional work, between red and expert, establish the idea of politics commanding professional work, using red to lead expert, being both red and expert, and oppose the idea of only being expert but not red and the eclecticism of juxtaposing professional work and politics. Second, in the relationship between mental labor and physical labor, establish the viewpoint of combining physical labor and mental labor, loving and frequently participating in physical labor, never separating from physical labor for life, and opposing the exploiting class thought of belittling physical labor and physical laborers. Third, in the relationship between theory and practice, resolutely put practice first, establish a style of learning that combines theory with practice, and break down dogmatism that is divorced from reality and blindly believes in books. Fourth, in terms of ideological methods and work style, establish the dialectical viewpoint of dividing one into two and the work style of investigation and research and seeking truth from facts, and oppose idealism and metaphysics. Fifth, in the relationship between the collective and the individual, between public and private, establish the idea of serving the Chinese people and the people of the world wholeheartedly, teaching for the revolution, learning for the revolution, and working for the revolution, and oppose all kinds of bourgeois individualism.
    Attendees unanimously agreed that studying Chairman Mao’s works and transforming their worldviews must be combined with participating in the practice of the three great revolutionary movements. The school Party committee should educate teachers and students not to treat the issue of going to the countryside and factories with a temporary point of view, but to be determined to serve the workers and peasants for a lifetime, combine with the workers and peasants for a lifetime, and learn from the workers and peasants for a lifetime. Currently, special emphasis should be placed on teachers and students serving the 500 million peasants, sharing weal and woe with the poor and lower-middle peasants, going to the countryside to get covered in mud, and making a great change in ideological feelings.
    The meeting believed that correct methods must be adopted for the ideological remolding of intellectuals. We must, in accordance with Chairman Mao’s instructions, resolutely implement the Party’s policy on intellectuals and the "double hundred" policy, fully promote democracy, adopt the "letting go" policy, adopt the methods of presenting facts, reasoning, and persuasive education, and the methods of self-criticism and conscious revolution, and not adopt simple, crude, and suppressive methods. Study should be practical and not formalistic.
    The meeting believed that emphasizing politics and studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works in a living way in higher education institutions must be implemented by conscientiously implementing the spirit of the National Conference on Part-Work (Farming) Part-Study Higher Education, conducting in-depth education revolution, and comprehensively improving the quality of education.
    The meeting believed that whether the higher education front can truly emphasize politics depends on whether the leading cadres of higher education departments and institutions take the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works in a living way. Leading cadres must overcome the ideological emotions of being complacent, arrogant, "relying on past achievements," and being accustomed to being educators, and, in the spirit of "grasping the heads, the heads grasping, the heads learning, the heads leading," more consciously study Chairman Mao’s works well. The study of leading cadres should also be in the spirit of rectification, in the spirit of self-criticism, putting themselves in, revealing their thoughts, transforming from simply studying to educate others to first studying to transform themselves, and combining the study of Chairman Mao’s works with transforming thoughts, consciously making revolution, summing up experiences, and improving work well.
    Attendees unanimously agreed to convene a national conference on exchanging experiences in studying Chairman Mao’s works in higher education institutions during the summer vacation of 1966 in order to promote study, promote work, and push the movement to study Chairman Mao’s works to a new climax.
    In addition to the Party secretaries of higher education institutions directly under the Ministry of Higher Education, the conference was also attended by the heads of a few schools and higher education departments (bureaus) affiliated to provinces and cities.

    高等学校突出政治活学活用毛主席著作
    必须把知识分子世界观的改造摆在首要地位
    高教部直属高等学校领导干部座谈会指出：在高等学校不突出无产阶级政治，就会培养出资产阶级的精神贵族，成为修正主义的社会基础。
    新华社济南十日电　高等教育部党委最近在山东济南召开的直属高等学校领导干部座谈会认为，高等教育战线必须进一步突出政治，组织广大师生员工更广泛更深入地开展学习毛主席著作的运动，大力推动高等教育的革命和知识分子的思想改造。座谈会强调指出，高等教育战线突出政治的关键，在于各级领导干部带头活学活用毛主席著作。
    座谈会认为，近年来，高等学校的师生员工学习毛主席著作的自觉性不断提高，出现了一批活学活用毛主席著作的先进单位和先进人物。他们在改造世界观、进行教育革命、从事科学研究和总务后勤工作等方面，都取得了一定的成绩。高等教育战线总的形势是好的。但是，同先进单位相比，高等教育部门和高等学校在学习毛主席著作方面还处于比较落后的状态，这与当前社会主义革命和社会主义建设的高涨形势是不相适应的。
    参加座谈会的人员着重学习了毛主席《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》和有关突出政治、民主集中制等问题的指示。会议指出，进一步突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想来统帅一切，改造一切，推动一切，这是当前全国高等学校的根本任务。
    会议认为，林彪同志关于突出政治的五项原则，对于高等学校是同样适用的，必须坚决地加以贯彻。在高等学校中，许多人对于政治和业务的关系，还存在着错误的认识。他们不是把政治和业务对立起来，就是把政治和业务并列起来，或者口上说的是“政治挂帅”，实际上做的是“业务挂帅”。到会者一致认为，在高等学校中必须就政治和业务的关系，认真地、深入地开展一次大讨论，通过讨论，使广大师生员工更深刻地认识到突出政治、以政治统帅业务的重要意义。
    座谈会在回顾了解放以来高等学校知识分子所经历的多次思想改造运动以后指出，高等学校是知识分子集中的地方，许多人在旧社会受的是资产阶级教育，许多人又成天同封建的、资本主义的文化遗产打交道。资产阶级思想经常地影响着他们。尽管我国高等学校进行过多次的思想改造运动，知识分子也有了相当的进步，但是对于多数人来说，树立无产阶级的共产主义世界观的问题，还没有根本解决。无产阶级要按照自己的世界观来改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观来改造世界。因此在高等学校中两条道路、两种世界观的斗争，兴无灭资的斗争，争夺青年一代的斗争是长期的，复杂的，有时是很激烈的。这是高等学校中的一个最根本的矛盾。高等学校是培养无产阶级的接班人，还是培养资产阶级的接班人？教育工作是促进三个差别的缩小以至消灭，还是加深和扩大三个差别？是照着资本主义、修正主义的框框办大学，还是坚决走我们自己的道路？这是决定我国高等教育是社会主义性质还是资本主义性质的根本方向问题。在高等学校不突出无产阶级的政治，就会培养出资产阶级的精神贵族，成为修正主义的社会基础。
    会议认为，教育者必须先受教育，有了革命的人和革命的思想，才能办革命的高等教育。在高等学校中突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，必须把知识分子世界观的改造，摆在首要地位。他们认为，知识分子和工农群众相比，在学习毛主席著作上存在的差距，归根到底是在一个“用”字上，要消灭这个差距，必须在“用”字上狠下功夫。首先要用在改造世界观上，其次才是运用毛主席的思想，解决业务工作中的各种实际问题。在改造客观世界的过程中改造主观世界，用改造主观世界来促进客观世界的改造，这是一个物质变精神，精神变物质的辩证过程。会议认为应该把学习毛主席著作的运动，变成高等教育战线一次群众性的整风运动，一次自觉的思想改造运动。在学习过程中，着重讨论和解决下列问题：第一，在政治和业务、红和专的关系上，树立政治统帅业务，以红带专，又红又专的思想，反对只专不红和把业务和政治并列的折衷主义思想。第二，在脑力劳动和体力劳动的关系上，树立体力劳动和脑力劳动相结合的观点，热爱并经常参加体力劳动，终身不脱离体力劳动，反对轻视体力劳动和体力劳动者的剥削阶级思想。第三，在理论和实践的关系上，坚决地把实践放在第一位，树立理论联系实际的学风，破除脱离实际、迷信书本的本本主义。第四，在思想方法和工作作风上，树立一分为二的辩证观点和调查研究、实事求是的作风，反对唯心主义和形而上学。第五，在集体和个人、公和私的关系上，树立彻底为中国人民和世界人民服务，为革命而教、为革命而学、为革命而工作的思想，反对形形色色的资产阶级个人主义思想。
    到会者一致认为，学习毛主席著作，改造世界观，必须同参加三大革命运动的实践结合起来。学校党委要教育师生不要抱一种临时的观点来对待下乡下厂的问题，而要下定决心一辈子为工农群众服务，一辈子同工农群众结合，一辈子向工农群众学习。当前要特别强调学校师生为五亿农民服务，和贫下中农同甘共苦，到农村去滚上一身泥巴，在思想感情上来一个大变化。
    会议认为，对于知识分子的思想改造，必须采取正确的方法。必须按照毛主席的指示，坚决贯彻党的知识分子政策和双百方针，充分发扬民主，采取“放”的方针，采取摆事实、讲道理、说服教育的方法，自我批评、自觉革命的方法，而不能采取简单粗暴和压服的方法。学习要讲求实效，不搞形式主义。
    会议认为，高等学校突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，必须落实到认真贯彻全国半工（农）半读高等教育会议的精神，深入进行教育革命，全面地提高教育质量。
    会议认为，高教战线上能否切实做到突出政治，关键在于高等教育部门和高等学校的领导干部是否带头活学活用毛主席著作。领导干部必须克服故步自封、骄傲自满、“凭老本吃饭”和习惯于以教育者自居的思想情绪，本着“抓头头、头头抓、头头学、头头带”的精神，更自觉地学好毛主席著作。领导干部的学习，也应该本着整风的精神，自我批评的精神，把自己摆进去，把思想亮出来，由单纯为教育别人而学，转变到首先为改造自己而学，把学习毛主席著作和改造思想、自觉革命、总结经验、改进工作，很好地结合起来。
    到会者一致同意在一九六六年暑假期间，召开全国高等学校学习毛主席著作经验交流大会，以便推动学习、促进工作，把学习毛主席著作的运动推向一个新的高潮。
    参加这次座谈会的，除了高等教育部直属高等学校的党委书记外，还有少数省、市所属学校和高等教育厅（局）的负责人。
