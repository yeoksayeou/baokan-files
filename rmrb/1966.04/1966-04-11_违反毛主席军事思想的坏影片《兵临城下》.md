    The Bad Film "The Battle of the City" Violates Chairman Mao's Military Thought
    Mei Jieren, Wang Yunzhi, Wuhan Institute of Technology

    Editor's Note: Since this newspaper launched criticism of films like "Northern Country Scenery," "Early Spring February," "The Lin Family Shop," and "Sleepless City," many readers have submitted articles criticizing some films with serious errors. "The Battle of the City" is one of them. The errors in these films show that the film creation has been widely and deeply invaded and influenced by bourgeois ideology. In the field of film art, as in other fields of literature and art, we must hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art and resolutely carry out the struggle against bourgeois ideology, that is, revisionist ideology, to the end.
    This newspaper will successively publish articles criticizing some bad films.

    The film "The Battle of the City" (adapted by: Bai Ren, Lin Nong; directed by: Lin Nong; Changchun Film Studio) depicts the story of the uprising and surrender of a Kuomintang army in a certain city during the Northeast Liberation War. After the film was released, it won enthusiastic praise from some comrades, who believed that the film praised the bravery and decisiveness of our army's commanders and underground party members and their skill in struggle, embodied Chairman Mao's strategic thinking of combining military struggle with political struggle, and was a good film with both profound educational significance and quite mature artistic techniques.
    Because of the enthusiastic recommendation of these comrades, we placed great expectations on the film. However, after watching the film, we were greatly disappointed. We believe that this is not a film worthy of praise, but a film with serious errors of principle. It beautifies and praises the enemy army, uglifies and distorts our army, blurs the distinction between the enemy and ourselves and the class nature of the enemy army; in the process of striving for the enemy army's uprising, it distorts our army's political struggle, negates the decisive role of armed struggle, and attributes the ultimate reason for the enemy army's uprising and surrender to the internal contradictions and struggles of the enemy, thus fundamentally violating Chairman Mao's military thought.

    Indulging in the Internal Division of the Enemy Cancels the Role of Armed Struggle
    The historical background unfolded in the film is 1947, and the central event reflected is the uprising of the 369th Division of the Kuomintang local army. 1947 was the great historical turning point of the Chinese People's Liberation War. In this year, the Chinese People's Liberation Army had already repelled the offensive of the millions of reactionary troops of Chiang Kai-shek, the running dog of the United States, and turned to the offensive itself; it had already reversed the counter-revolutionary wheels of American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang on the land of China, leading them towards the road of destruction, and promoted its own revolutionary wheels, leading them towards the road of victory. This glorious victory of the People's Liberation War severely hit the enemy, causing extremely profound feelings of defeat in the entire enemy camp. It was precisely under the impact of this irresistible revolutionary torrent, under the blows of our army's armed struggle, which was like a swift storm and had the power to overturn mountains and seas, and under the influence of correct political work that explained the advantages and disadvantages, blamed the righteousness, and pointed out the future, that a part of the enemy army was forced to rise up, abandon the darkness and turn to the light, and return to the people. If the film truly reflected the historical truth of this stage, then the writer and director should have profoundly grasped the general trend of class struggle at this stage, correctly handled the interrelationship of the various factors that promoted the enemy army's uprising, and, through the uprising of the 369th Division, demonstrated the invincible power of the people's war and embodied the brilliance of Chairman Mao's strategic thinking of combining military struggle with political struggle. However, how does the film portray this uprising? Among the various factors that contributed to the uprising of the 369th Division, what is the decisive factor grasped by the writers and directors?
    Is it the powerful pressure of a hundred thousand troops approaching the city? No. Although the film uses a few hasty shots at the beginning to vaguely outline the scene of our army gathering, judging from the entire film, it neither forcefully shows the overwhelming momentum of our army approaching the city and its destructive power from the front, creating a clear situation of catching turtles in a jar, nor does it write about the enemy's strong pessimistic and desperate emotions, forcefully highlighting this powerful force and the great pressure of this force on the enemy's spirit and emotions from the side. When the 369th Division suffered a serious setback, and underground party member Li Zhongmin advised Zhao Chongwu (the commander of the 369th Division) to send someone out to probe our army, did Zhao Chongwu not answer arrogantly: "No, the current situation is a struggle between two tigers, and the victory or defeat is undecided. Even if the Kuomintang army retreats to the south of the Yangtze River, it still has half of the country"? When the 369th Division was on the verge of destruction, and Zheng Hanchen (the regimental commander of the 369th Division) said the word "uprising," did Zhao Chongwu not feel astonished and remain hesitant? From this, it can be seen that the so-called "approaching the city" does not see much of the "troops" approaching the city - the People's Liberation Army, and this "troop" did not make Zhao Chongwu uneasy or feel like he had no way out, and did not play a pivotal role in promoting the uprising.
    Is it the powerful influence of our army's political struggle? No. The so-called "political work" in the film neither makes the senior Kuomintang generals truly understand the trend of the times, recognize their crimes of opposing communism and opposing the people, and understand that abandoning the darkness and turning to the light is the only way out, nor does it make the vast number of Kuomintang soldiers recognize the counter-revolutionary essence of Chiang Kai-shek and understand that throwing themselves into the arms of the people is the bright road. Soldiers are originally the mass base of the uprising, but the film places them in an insignificant position. Whether it is Minister Jiang of our army's liaison department or underground party members Li Zhongmin and Fan Guoliang, their eyes are all fixed on Zhao Chongwu and Zheng Hanchen, and they never thought of winning over the lower-level officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang. It seems that their fate is all controlled by Zhao Chongwu and Zheng Hanchen, and it seems that winning over Zhao Chongwu and Zheng Hanchen will make everything a success. Of course, the film still made a little embellishment in this regard, which is to arrange a broadcast to the enemy. The background of the broadcast is an empty position and a bleak and desolate night. The content of the broadcast is how the 369th Division has been discriminated against and squeezed out, etc. The entire audience of the broadcast is only one "small soldier." Even this one audience is not so "enthusiastic." What he wants is not "spiritual food," but steamed buns. After climbing to our army's position and having a full meal, he still climbed back to be his soldier. Isn't this an insult and mockery of our army's political work? The film did spend a lot of effort in winning over the senior Kuomintang generals, which is concentrated in Minister Jiang's riskily entering the city to secretly negotiate with Zhao Chongwu. It stands to reason that in the situation where the enemy is weak and we are strong, we should hold the initiative in the negotiation. However, Minister Jiang in the film appears humble and short-sighted. He does not dare to touch on Zhao Chongwu's crimes of opposing communism and opposing the people, but instead tries to make him change his mind with the friendship of "friends" and "old colleagues"; he does not win over Zhao Chongwu through struggle, but instead fantasizes that Zhao Chongwu's so-called "glorious history" during the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance Against Japan will make him sober. Even these persuasions that replace principles with private feelings and these co-options that replace politics with emotion did not move Zhao Chongwu, but an appointment order from Chiang Kai-shek made Zhao Chongwu feel flattered and grateful. In contrast, isn't this a satire of Minister Jiang's painstaking so-called "political work"?
    So, what is the decisive factor that prompted the uprising of the 369th Division? The film clearly tells us: it is the contradictions and conflicts within the enemy. The pressure of approaching the city did not frighten Zhao Chongwu, and Minister Jiang's exhortations did not move Zhao Chongwu, but the infighting and strife within the enemy, such as the verbal battle at the birthday banquet, the dispute after Zheng Hanchen's wife was insulted, and the conflict over grabbing grain at the airport, etc., made Zhao Chongwu fall into deeper and deeper pain and become more and more estranged from his own group. And the climax of this conflict is the secret telegram that Chiang Kai-shek sent to Hu's staff officer: "Zhao Chongwu is harboring ulterior motives. After breaking through to Shenyang, he should be eliminated quickly." When this telegram fell into Zhao Chongwu's hands. A telegram transformed Zhao Chongwu from a state of swallowing his anger to daring to stand up straight and directly accuse Hu's staff officer; changed his hesitation to decisively announcing the uprising; swept away his frowning face and prepared to fly out of the "cage." Artistic creation must reflect the general through the individual, the universal through the particular, and the inevitable through the accidental. However, the film "The Battle of the City" fundamentally violates this point. Zhao Chongwu's uprising was not mainly caused by the situation of our army approaching the city and catching turtles in a jar and by political struggle, but was the result of the intensification of the contradictions between the Central Army and the local army, the direct line army and the non-direct line army within the enemy, which is the conclusion that the film tells us.

    The history of the Liberation War tells us: the circumstances of the enemy army's uprising are complex, and the factors that promote the enemy army's uprising are also diverse, and specific problems should be analyzed specifically. However, the history of the Liberation War also eloquently proves an irrefutable truth: no matter what kind of enemy, what kind of region, or what kind of situation, military struggle and political struggle are the decisive factors in promoting the enemy army's uprising. Chairman Mao said it well: "Anything reactionary, if you don't hit it, it won't fall. … A bell doesn't ring if you don't strike it. A table doesn't move if you don't carry it. … If our army doesn't fight, the enemy and puppets won't surrender their guns. When the broom arrives, the political influence can fully take effect. Our broom is the Communist Party, the Eighth Route Army, and the New Fourth Army." The enemy's logic is to make trouble - fail - make trouble again - fail again, until destruction. Without relative or absolute advantage in military strength, without heavy or fatal blows in military terms, the enemy will not kindly put down their weapons, and political influence will not work. Trapped beasts still fight. As long as the enemy still has capital, still has territory, and still has a glimmer of hope, they will not wash their hands of their anti-communist and anti-people activities. The stubborn essence determines their nature of struggling desperately before death. Only under the heavy blows and pressure of our army's armed struggle, in the situation where people are turning away, the general trend is irresistible, and there is no way out, can the enemy army possibly rise up and surrender, through different channels, using different methods, and after continuous struggle, explaining the situation to them, clarifying the advantages and disadvantages, and arranging a way out. This is a truth verified by revolutionary history, and this is a valuable understanding gained with blood. To deny the decisive role of military struggle and political struggle in promoting the enemy army's uprising by using the excuse of the complexity of the situation and the particularity of the contradictions is to tamper with revolutionary history and distort Chairman Mao's military thought.

    Then, among the various factors that promote the enemy army's uprising, is the enemy's internal contradiction a factor? It is a factor. Chairman Mao repeatedly taught us to use contradictions, win over the majority, oppose the minority, and defeat them one by one in order to disintegrate the enemy and strengthen ourselves. But this is not the main and decisive factor, but the secondary and non-decisive factor. The enemy's interior is not monolithic. In Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary army, the contradictions between the Central Army and the local army, the direct line troops and the non-direct line troops, as well as other various groups and factions, are objectively present due to uneven distribution of spoils, power struggles, mutual squeezing out, attacks, and encroachments, and are sometimes even very fierce. The enemy's dog-eat-dog contradictions weaken their strength, and we should use them to promote their disintegration. However, the enemy's internal contradictions are only "both painful and itchy" contradictions, and are not fundamental contradictions; for us, they are only "not too big or too small gaps" that can be used, rather than key gaps. For their own interests, they engage in intrigues; on the point of being enemies with the revolution and enemies with the people, they are consistent. When the revolution endangers their fundamental interests, they will temporarily stop arguing and reunite to deal with the people. The writers and directors of the film "The Battle of the City" only see the side of their contradictions, but deny the main and essential side of their unity to jointly deal with the revolution, and exaggerate the enemy's internal contradictions as irreconcilable contradictions and overwhelming contradictions, asking us to lay down our weapons and place our hopes on the enemy's self-disintegration. Isn't this promoting that there is no need to carry out armed struggle and that the enemy can automatically rise up? Isn't this violating Chairman Mao's strategic thinking of combining military struggle with political struggle?

    Beautifying the Enemy and Sympathizing with the Enemy
    Distinguishing who is our enemy and who is our friend is the primary question of the revolution. Whether we can distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and whether we can correctly distinguish and handle the issue of the enemy and ourselves, is also the main criterion for measuring the success or failure of literary and artistic works. A revolutionary literary and art worker must stand on the position of the people, love what the people love, hate what the people hate, praise what the people love, and oppose what the people hate. However, in handling the internal contradictions of the enemy, the film "The Battle of the City" beautifies the side of Zhao Chongwu and Zheng Hanchen, tampers with their history, castrates their class essence, transforms ferocity into kindness, transforms stubbornness into enlightenment, and makes a blatant beautification of them that loses its position.
    Zhao Chongwu and Zheng Hanchen are the heads of the Kuomintang local army, senior generals who have made many contributions to Chiang Kai-shek's "Party-State." From the position of the people, whether it is the head of the Central Army or the head of the local army, they are all jackals of the same lair, all oppressors and exploiters riding on the heads of the people, and all executioners who cruelly harm the people. From the revolutionary point of view, a loyalist like Zheng Hanchen who is willing to "succeed or die for the Party-State" for Chiang Kai-shek must be a mortal enemy of the revolution; Zhao Chongwu, who has made many contributions to the "Party-State" for more than twenty years, his "contributions" must be "contributions" against communism and against the people, and his history must be a history against communism and against the people.

    However, what kind of people are Zhao Chongwu and Zheng Hanchen, who have been carefully disguised by the writers and directors, in the film?

    They have a glorious past and a revolutionary history. Zheng Hanchen is an anti-Japanese hero who "fought bravely against the Japanese invaders on the Xiang-Gui front," and Zhao Chongwu is a Northern Expedition hero who chatted about the Chinese revolution with Minister Jiang on the Yellow Crane Tower twenty years ago, and a national hero who "made many military achievements" during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Moreover, it is none other than Minister Jiang of our army's liaison department in the film who is putting gold on their faces and testifying to their history.

    They have kind hearts that are considerate of soldiers and care for the common people. Zheng Hanchen is a good person who cherishes soldiers, and this point is confirmed by the "small" soldier: "Regimental Commander Zheng usually treats his brothers very well." The writers and directors of the film are afraid that this praise is not enough, so they deliberately arrange a scene to render it. When the 369th Division cannot get supplies and is "forced" to rob the people's food, Zheng Hanchen does not forgive or appreciate the actions of his subordinates, but instead sternly asks: "Why rob the people's food?" In the situation where food is exhausted and they have to "defend" the city, they would rather let their troops starve and risk going to compete for the airdropped food than harm the interests of the people. What else is there to say about Zheng Hanchen's goodness? Zheng Hanchen in the film is such a good person, and Zhao Chongwu is no less so. When the 369th Division and the 302nd Division clashed over the airdropped food, Zhao Chongwu rushed to the airport and saw his subordinate Dong Biao bound, he felt very painful in his heart. From his helpless gaze, how much sympathy and concern for his subordinates was revealed! Regarding this point, the film confirms through Zhao Chongwu's words: "If it weren't for you old subordinates, I would really retire." For the sake of his old subordinates, he would rather swallow the pain of discrimination and endure the blows of exclusion than retire. What else is there to say about Zhao Chongwu's "love"?

    They have unfortunate encounters and pitiful situations. Zheng Hanchen's wife was humiliated by the 302nd Division, and Zheng Hanchen dared to be angry but not to speak; Zhao Chongwu's subordinates were bound for competing for airdropped food, and Zhao Chongwu was helpless and swallowed his anger; knowing that Hu's staff officer sent the 369th Division to break through was a conspiracy to harm them, Zhao Chongwu and Zheng Hanchen had to obey. One blow after another, one layer of oppression deeper than the other, overwhelmed them to the point where they were "mournfully lowering their eyes," "distracted and lowering their heads," and "thinking even more depressingly." Through these scenes, the film not only portrays Zhao Chongwu and Zheng Hanchen as pitiful figures who are insulted and harmed, but also reveals how much sympathy and pity, how much indignation and injustice the writers and directors have for their situation from those close-up shots that depict the psychology and emotions of Zhao Chongwu and Zheng Hanchen!

    Beautifying, praising, and sympathizing, this is the attitude of the writers and directors towards the enemy army's division commander and the enemy army's regimental commander.

    A glorious history, a charitable heart, being harmed by others without harming others, this is the image of the enemy army's division commander and the enemy army's regimental commander portrayed by the film.

    This portrayal of the film completely deviates from the class nature of the characters.

    In a class society, the material living conditions and class status of a person determine the class essence of the person. Zhao Chongwu and Zheng Hanchen's anti-communist and anti-people positions determine their anti-communist and anti-people essence. We cannot forget their class essence and reactionary history in order to win them over; nor can we sympathize with and pity them because they are the weaker and harmed party in the internal struggle of the enemy. Chairman Mao repeatedly taught us: in the period of the alliance between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, we must be vigilant against right-leaning errors. Similarly, when winning over the enemy and when negotiating with the enemy, we must also be vigilant against this kind of error. The writers and directors of the film "The Battle of the City" completely forgot this point. Originally, the history of Zhao Chongwu and Zheng Hanchen can only be an unclear history. Those heroes and good men who actively fought the civil war for Chiang Kai-shek and were willing to "succeed or die for the Party-State" were all vanguards against communism and against the people. Could Zhao Chongwu and Zheng Hanchen be rare exceptions? Even if they are rare exceptions, they are now standing at the forefront of the civil war, doing counter-revolutionary things. Do we still have to look back at their "glorious history" and praise their "great achievements"? Originally, the hearts of Zhao Chongwu and Zheng Hanchen can only be iron hearts that cruelly oppress and extract from the people. If they also have a heart to love the people and sympathize with the people, then what is the difference between the Kuomintang army and the People's Army? What is the difference between the Kuomintang generals and the People's cadres? Even if they have a little charitable expression, it is only false compassion and the decoration of the facade. Do we still have to thank them for their "grace" and praise their "great virtue"? Originally, the contradictions between Zhao Chongwu and Zheng Hanchen and Hu's staff officer and Ma's army commander are just "a particularly interesting struggle between big dogs, small dogs, full dogs, and hungry dogs." Although there are differences such as big, small, full, and hungry between them, we should treat them differently, but their essence is the same. In their dog-eat-dog conflicts, can we beautify any side and sympathize with any side? The writers and directors of the film stood on the side of Zhao Chongwu and Zheng Hanchen, completely treating them as positive characters to sympathize with and praise. In them, we cannot see any class imprint, only the "upright" and "kind" human nature. If, at first, the writers and directors of the film still dressed them in the cloak of "senior Kuomintang military officers," then in the end, even this thin cloak was discarded. At the end of the film, the "Party-State" hero Zheng Hanchen transformed himself into a hero of the uprising who shouted "Oppose the civil war." What role can this black-and-white reversal and right-and-wrong indiscrimination in the film play, except to blur the class boundaries of the masses of the people, paralyze the fighting will of the masses of the people, and guide the masses of the people to love the enemy and sympathize with the enemy? What role can it play other than to guide the masses of the people to lay down their weapons, abandon class struggle, and fantasize that the enemy can "become a Buddha on the spot"?

    The problems existing in the film "The Battle of the City" are serious. It does not truthfully reflect the historical truth of the People's Liberation War period, but greatly distorts this historical truth; it does not embody Chairman Mao's military thought, but violates this thought; it stands in the wrong position and sings a very inappropriate song to the enemy. For this film with a fundamentally wrong ideological tendency, we cannot but raise our opinions and cannot but express our attitude!

### 违反毛主席军事思想的坏影片《兵临城下》

    违反毛主席军事思想的坏影片《兵临城下》
    武汉工学院　梅介人　王运芝
    编者按：从本报开展对《北国江南》《早春二月》《林家铺子》《不夜城》等影片的批判以来，又有不少读者来稿，批评一些具有严重错误的影片，《兵临城下》就是其中一部。这些影片的错误，表明在电影创作上受到资产阶级思想的侵袭和影响很广很深。在电影艺术领域中，如同其他文学艺术领域一样，必须高举毛泽东文艺思想的红旗，坚决地把反对资产阶级思想也就是修正主义思想的斗争进行到底。
    本报将陆续发表批评一些坏影片的文章。
    影片《兵临城下》（改编：白刃、林农；导演：林农；长春电影制片厂拍摄）描写的是东北解放战争时期，某城蒋军起义投诚的故事。影片公演以后，博得了一些同志的热烈赞扬，认为影片歌颂了我军指挥员、地下党员的英勇果断和善于斗争，体现了毛主席的军事斗争与政治斗争相结合的战略思想，是一部既有十分深刻的教育意义，又有颇为成熟的艺术技巧的好影片。
    由于这些同志的热心推荐，我们对影片寄托了很大的期望。但是看了影片，不禁大失所望。我们认为这不是一部值得称道的影片，而是一部有严重的原则性错误的影片。它美化和歌颂了敌军，丑化和歪曲了我军，模糊了敌我界线和敌军的阶级本质；在争取敌军起义的过程中，它歪曲了我军的政治斗争，否定了武装斗争的决定性的作用，把敌军起义投诚的终极原因，归结为敌人内部的矛盾和斗争，从而在根本上违背了毛主席的军事思想。
    沉醉于敌人的内部分化勾销武装斗争的作用
    影片展开的时代背景是一九四七年，反映的中心事件是国民党地方军三六九师的起义。一九四七年，是中国人民解放战争的伟大历史转捩点。这一年，中国人民解放军已经打退了美国走狗蒋介石的数百万反动军队的进攻，并使自己转入了进攻；已经在中国这一块土地上，扭转了美国帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮的反革命车轮，使之走向覆灭的道路，推进了自己的革命车轮，使之走向胜利的道路。人民解放战争这一光辉的胜利，沉重地打击了敌人，在整个敌人营垒中引起了极端深刻的失败情绪。正是在这种不可阻挡的革命激流的冲击下，在我军势如急风暴雨，力能排山倒海的武装斗争的打击下，在晓以利害、责以大义、指明前途的正确的政治工作的影响下，一部分敌军被迫起义，弃暗投明，归向了人民。如果影片果真是反映了这一阶段的历史真实的话，那么编导者应该深刻把握这一阶段阶级斗争的总趋势，正确处理促成敌军起义的诸因素的相互关系，通过三六九师的起义，表现出人民战争无坚不摧的强大威力，体现出毛主席的军事斗争与政治斗争相结合的战略思想的光辉。然而，影片是怎样表现这场起义的呢？在促成三六九师起义的诸因素中，编导者所把握的决定性的因素是什么呢？
    是十万大军兵临城下的强大压力么？不是。影片的开头虽然用了匆匆几个镜头，影影绰绰地勾划了一下我军正在集结的场面，但是从整个影片来看，既没有从正面有力地表现出我军兵临城下排山倒海的气势，摧枯拉朽的力量，造成瓮中捉鳖的鲜明的情势，也没有写出敌人浓重的悲观绝望情绪，从侧面有力地烘托出这种强大的力量，以及这种力量对于敌人精神上的、情绪上的强大压力。当三六九师遭受了严重的挫折，地下党员李忠民劝赵崇武（三六九师师长）派一个人出去向我军试探一下的时候，赵崇武不是趾高气扬地回答：“不，目前是两虎相争，胜负未定，纵使国军退至长江以南，也还有半壁河山”么？当三六九师濒于覆灭，郑汉臣（三六九师团长）说出“起义”两个字的时候，赵崇武不是感到惊愕，依然处在迟疑不决之中么？由此可见，所谓“兵临城下”，既没有见到多少“临城”的“兵”——解放军，这种“兵”也没有使赵崇武惶遽不安，感到走投无路，对促成起义产生举足轻重的作用。
    是我军政治斗争的强大影响么？不是。影片中的所谓“政治工作”既没有使国民党的高级将领真正懂得大势所趋的形势，认清自己反共反人民的罪恶，明白弃暗投明是唯一的出路，也没有使国民党广大士兵认清蒋介石的反革命本质，懂得投向人民是光明大道。士兵，本来是起义的群众基础，影片却把他们放在无足轻重的地位。无论是我军联络部姜部长也好，还是地下党员李忠民、范国良也好，眼睛都是盯在赵崇武、郑汉臣身上的，根本没想到去争取国民党的下级官兵。仿佛他们的命运都操纵在赵崇武、郑汉臣之手，仿佛争取了赵崇武、郑汉臣，一切便大功告成了。当然，影片在这方面还是作了一点点缀的，这就是安排了一次对敌广播。广播的背景是空旷的阵地、凄清寥落的深夜，广播的内容是三六九师如何遭受歧视，遭受排挤等等，广播的全部听众只有“小个子兵”一个。就是这一个听众也不那么“热心”，他要的不是“精神的粮食”，而是馒头，爬到我军阵地饱嚼了一顿以后，依然爬回去当他的兵去了。这不是对我军政治工作的污辱和嘲笑么？对于国民党高级将领的争取，影片确实花了不少笔墨，煞费了一番苦心，这集中表现在姜部长冒险进城与赵崇武秘密谈判上。照理说，在敌弱我强的形势下进行谈判，主动权应该操在我方之手。影片中的姜部长却显得低声下气，志短“情”长。不敢触及赵崇武反共反人民的罪行，而是试图以“朋友”、“老同事”的情谊使他回心转意；不是以斗争争取赵崇武，而是幻想以赵崇武在北伐和抗日时期的所谓“光荣历史”使他清醒过来。就是这些私情代替原则的劝说也好，感情代替政治的拉拢也好，也没有使赵崇武心动，而蒋介石的一个擢升令，却使赵崇武受宠若惊，感激涕零。两相对照，这不是对姜部长呕心沥血的所谓“政治工作”的一个讥讽么？
    那么，促使三六九师起义的决定因素是什么呢？影片清楚地告诉我们：是敌人内部的矛盾和冲突。兵临城下的压力，没有使赵崇武恐惧，姜部长的感化劝说，没有使赵崇武心动，而敌人内部的倾轧和争斗，诸如祝寿宴会上的舌战，郑汉臣的妻子被辱后的争执，机场抢粮的冲突等等，却使赵崇武陷入了越来越深的痛苦之中，越来越背向自己的集团。而这场冲突的最高潮，是蒋介石给胡高参的密电：“赵崇武既怀二心，突围至沈后，宜速剪除”落到赵崇武手中那一场。一封电报，使赵崇武一变忍气吞声之态，敢于挺起腰杆直面指责胡高参了；一改犹豫不决之状，当机立断宣布起义了；一扫愁眉苦脸之容，准备飞出“樊笼”了。艺术创作必须通过个别反映一般，通过特殊反映普遍，通过偶然反映必然。影片《兵临城下》却根本违背了这一点。赵崇武的起义，主要不是由于我军兵临城下、瓮中捉鳖的形势和政治斗争促成，而是敌人内部中央军和地方军、嫡系军和非嫡系军矛盾尖锐化的结果，这就是影片告诉我们的结论。
    解放战争的历史告诉我们：敌军起义的情况是错综复杂的，促使敌军起义的因素也是多种多样的，具体问题应该具体分析。但是，解放战争的历史，也雄辩地证明了一个颠扑不破的真理：不管是什么样的敌人，什么样的地区，什么样的情况，军事的斗争和政治的斗争都是促使敌军起义的决定性的因素。毛主席说得好：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。……钟不敲是不响的。桌子不搬是不走的。……我们的军队不去打，敌伪就不缴枪。扫帚到了，政治影响才能充分发生效力。我们的扫帚就是共产党、八路军和新四军。”敌人的逻辑是捣乱——失败——再捣乱——再失败，直至灭亡。没有军力上的相对优势或绝对优势，没有军事上的沉重打击或致命打击，敌人是不会发善心放下武器的，政治影响也是起不了作用的。困兽犹斗，敌人只要还有资本，还有地盘，还有一线希望，反共反人民的勾当他是不会洗手不干的。顽固的本质，决定了他们垂死挣扎的本性。只有在我军武装斗争的沉重打击和迫使下，人心背向、大势所趋、悬崖绝路的情况下，通过不同的途径，运用不同的方式，经过不断的斗争，给他讲明形势，说清利害，安排出路，敌军才有可能起义投诚。这是为革命历史所证实的真理，这是用鲜血换来的可贵的认识。借口情况的复杂，矛盾的特殊，否认军事斗争和政治斗争对于促使敌军起义的决定性的作用，就是对革命历史的篡改，对毛主席军事思想的歪曲。
    那么，在促使敌军起义的诸因素中，敌人内部的矛盾是不是一个因素呢？是因素。毛主席一再教导我们，要利用矛盾，争取多数，反对少数，各个击破，达到瓦解敌人、壮大自己的目的。但是这不是主要的、决定性的因素，而是次要的、非决定性的因素。敌人内部并非铁板一块。在蒋介石的反动军队里，中央军和地方军、嫡系部队和非嫡系部队，以及其他各个集团、各个派系之间因分赃不匀、争权夺利，相互倾轧、排挤、打击和侵吞的矛盾是客观存在的，有时甚至是很激烈的。敌人这种狗咬狗的矛盾，削弱了他们的力量，我们应该加以利用，促使他们分化。但是敌人这种内部矛盾，不过是“又痛又痒”的矛盾，并不是根本性的矛盾；对我们来说，不过是可以利用的“不大不小的缺口”，而不是关键性的缺口。为了各自的利益，他们钩心斗角；在与革命为敌、与人民为敌这一点上，他们又是一致的。当革命危及到他们根本利益的时候，他们会暂时停止争吵，重新联合起来对付人民。影片《兵临城下》的编导者只看到他们矛盾的一面，却否认他们联合起来共同对付革命的主要的、本质的一面，并把敌人的内部矛盾，夸大为不可调和的矛盾，压倒一切的矛盾，要我们放下武器，把希望寄托在敌人的自行分化上，这不是宣扬不必进行武装斗争，敌人可以自动起义又是什么呢？这不是违背毛主席的军事斗争与政治斗争相结合的战略思想又是什么呢？
    美化敌人　同情敌人
    分清谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友，这是革命的首要问题。能不能分清敌我，能不能正确区分和处理敌我问题，这也是衡量文艺作品成败的主要标准。一个革命的文艺工作者，必须站在人民的立场上，爱人民之爱，憎人民之憎，歌颂人民所喜爱的东西，反对人民所憎恶的东西。然而，影片《兵临城下》在处理敌人的内部矛盾的时候，却美化了赵崇武、郑汉臣一方，篡改了他们的历史，阉割了他们的阶级本质，化凶恶为善良，化顽固为开明，对他们作了丧失立场的露骨的美化。
    赵崇武、郑汉臣是国民党地方军的头子，为蒋介石的“党国”立过很多汗马功劳的高级将领。从人民的立场看，不论是中央军的头子也好，地方军的头子也好，都是一丘之貉，都是骑在人民头上的压迫者、剥削者，都是残害人民的刽子手。从革命的观点来看，象郑汉臣那样为蒋介石的“党国”“不成功便成仁”的忠臣，必定是革命的死敌；象赵崇武那样二十多年来为“党国”立了很多汗马功劳的人，他的“汗马功劳”必定是反共反人民的“功劳”，他的历史，必定是反共反人民的历史。
    然而，经过编导者精心伪装起来的赵崇武、郑汉臣，在影片里是什么样的人呢？
    他们有着光荣的过去，革命的历史。郑汉臣是在“湘桂前线奋勇杀日寇”的抗日勇士，赵崇武是二十年前在黄鹤楼上和姜部长一起畅谈过中国革命的北伐好汉，在抗日战争时期“立过很多战功”的民族英雄。而且，往他们的脸上贴金，为他们的历史作证的不是别人，而是影片中的我军联络部姜部长。
    他们有着体贴士兵、爱护百姓的好心肠。郑汉臣是爱惜士兵的好人，这一点影片通过“小个子”兵之口为他作了鉴定：“郑团长平时待兄弟们挺好的”。影片编导者唯恐这种赞美还不够，又特意安排了一个场面来进行渲染。当三六九师得不到供给、“被迫”抢老百姓的粮食的时候，郑汉臣对自己部下的行径不是宽恕、赞赏，而是声色俱厉的责问：“为什么要抢老百姓粮食？”在粮尽而又要“固守”城市的情况下，宁肯让自己的部队忍饥挨饿，宁肯让他们冒风险去争夺空投的粮食，也不肯损害老百姓的利益，郑汉臣的好，还有什么说的呢？影片中郑汉臣是这样的好人，赵崇武也毫不逊色。当三六九师和三○二师为争夺空投粮食发生冲突，赵崇武赶到机场见到部下董彪被缚时，内心感到非常痛苦，从他无可奈何的目光里，流露了对部下的多少同情和关切呵！关于这一点，影片通过赵崇武之口为他作了表白：“要不是为了你们这些老部下，我真要解甲归田”。为了自己的老部下，宁可吞饮歧视的痛苦，忍受排挤的打击，也不愿解甲归田，赵崇武的“爱”还有什么说的呢？
    他们有着不幸的遭遇，可怜的处境。郑汉臣的妻子为三○二师侮辱，郑汉臣是敢怒而不敢言；为争夺空投粮食，赵崇武的部下被缚，赵崇武是无可奈何，忍气吞声；明知胡高参派三六九师去突围是阴谋坑害，赵崇武和郑汉臣也只得唯命是听。打击一个接一个，压逼一层深一层，压得他们一忽儿“愁苦地低垂着双目”，一忽儿“心绪纷乱地低着头”，一忽儿“更压抑地苦思着”。影片通过这些场面，不仅把赵崇武、郑汉臣写成了被侮辱与被损害的楚楚可怜的人物，而且从那些刻划赵崇武、郑汉臣的心理、情绪的特写镜头里，又流露了编导者对他们的处境的多少同情和怜悯，多少激愤和不平呵！
    美化，歌颂，同情，这就是编导者对敌军师长和敌军团长的态度。
    光荣的历史，慈善的心肠，受人损害而不损害人，这就是影片所刻划的敌军师长和敌军团长的形象。
    影片的这一刻划完全背离了人物的阶级本性。
    在阶级社会里，人的物质生活条件和阶级地位，决定着人的阶级本质。赵崇武、郑汉臣的反共反人民的地位，决定着他们反共反人民的本质。我们不能为着要争取他们，而忘记他们的阶级本质和反动历史；更不能因为他们是敌人内部斗争中的弱小者和受损害者，而同情和怜悯他们。毛主席再三教导我们：在资产阶级与无产阶级联合的时期，要警惕右倾的错误。同样，在争取敌人的时候，在与敌人谈判的时候，也要警惕这种错误。影片《兵临城下》的编导者却根本忘记了这一点。本来赵崇武和郑汉臣的历史，只能是不清不白的历史。那些为蒋介石积极打内战，为“党国”“不成功便成仁”的英雄好汉，都是反共反人民的急先锋，无独有偶，赵崇武和郑汉臣能例外么？就算他们是罕见的例外吧，现在他们已经站在内战的前列，干着反革命的勾当，难道我们还要去回顾他们的“光荣历史”，歌颂他们的“丰功伟业”么？本来，赵崇武和郑汉臣的心肠，只能是残酷压迫榨取人民的铁石心肠。如果他们也有爱护人民之心，体恤人民之意的话，那么国民党的军队与人民的军队还有什么区别呢？国民党的将领与人民的干部还有什么区别呢？就算他们有一点慈善的表示吧，那也只是虚假的慈悲，门面的装潢，难道我们还要去感谢他们的“恩典”，赞美他们的“大德”么？本来，赵崇武、郑汉臣与胡高参、马军长之间的矛盾，不过是“大狗、小狗、饱狗、饿狗之间的一点特别有趣的争斗。”尽管他们之间有大、小、饱、饿等等差别，我们应加以区别对待，但他们的本质却是一样的。在他们狗咬狗的冲突中，难道我们能美化哪一方，同情哪一方么？影片编导者却站在赵崇武、郑汉臣这一边，完全把他们当作正面人物来同情和歌颂。在他们身上，看不见什么阶级的烙印，有的只是“正直”、“善良”的人性。如果说，起初影片编导者还给他们披着“国民党高级军官”的外衣，那么最后连这件薄薄的外衣都丢掉了。影片的结尾，“党国”英雄郑汉臣摇身一变，竟成了高喊“反对内战”的起义英雄。影片这种黑白颠倒、是非不分的描写，除了起到模糊人民群众的阶级界线，麻痹人民群众的斗争意志，引导人民群众去爱敌人，同情敌人的作用，还能起什么作用呢？除掉引导人民群众放下武装，放弃阶级斗争，幻想敌人“立地成佛”，还能起什么作用呢？
    影片《兵临城下》存在的问题是严重的，它没有真实地反映人民解放战争时期的历史真实，而是极大地歪曲了这一历史真实；它没有体现出毛主席的军事思想，而是违反了这一思想；它站错了立场，对敌人进行了很不恰当的歌颂。对于这一部思想倾向根本错误的影片，我们不能不提出我们的意见，不能不表示我们的态度！
