    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, April 27th – Tirana Radio in Albania, on the 25th, issued a commentary on the Albanian Party and Government Delegation's visit to China, saying, "The visit of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation to China is a new manifestation of the very close, fraternal, and internationalist ties established between our two peoples and countries, and a new expression of the steel-like unity built on the immortal and living revolutionary principles of Marxism-Leninism."
    The commentary said, "Although our two countries are far apart, mountains and oceans cannot stop the friendship and unity between our two peoples and parties, which is based on the common ideals and goals for which they are fighting. The People's Republic of China is the largest country in Asia and the most populous country in the world, while our country is one of the smallest in Europe. However, our two countries have established the most mutually equal relations, precisely because the basis of this relationship is the correct principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism."
    The commentary pointed out, "Mutual visits between our two countries have now become a tradition. They embody close friendship and ties and help to further strengthen this friendship."
    The commentary said, "Our people sympathetically, admiringly, and happily watch the great achievements that the great Chinese people have made and are making, and regard these achievements as their own. Every achievement of China is a blow to the aggressive plots of U.S. imperialism, which is frantically hostile to the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people. At the same time, the achievements of the Chinese people are also the achievements of all anti-imperialist revolutionary forces in the world, making the people of all countries feel happy and enhancing the prestige of the People's Republic of China on the international stage. Socialist China has now become a powerful and progressive country, enjoying great international prestige and playing a great role in the development of the world revolution and progress. Under the current conditions, no important international issues can or cannot be resolved without the participation of socialist China. The People's Republic of China stands at the forefront of the struggle of the peoples of all countries against imperialism and modern revisionism."
    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, April 27th – For the past two days, Albanian newspapers have been publishing news of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation led by Mehmet Shehu, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Labor Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, on their visit to China in a large space.

    地拉那电台热烈祝贺阿党政代表团访问中国
    阿中人民钢铁般的友谊团结日益增强
    阿报以大量篇幅显著刊登阿党政代表团访华消息
    新华社地拉那二十七日电　阿尔巴尼亚地拉那电台二十五日就阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团访问中国发表评论说，“阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团访问中国，是我们两国人民和两国之间建立起来的十分紧密的兄弟般的和国际主义的联系的新表现，是建立在不朽的和活生生的马克思列宁主义革命原则基础上的钢铁般团结的新表现”。
    评论说，“我们两国虽然相距遥远，但是高山和海洋阻挡不住我们两国人民和两党建立在为之而斗争的共同理想和目的基础之上的友谊和团结。中华人民共和国是亚洲最大的国家，是世界上人口最多的国家，而我国是欧洲最小的国家之一。但是我们两国建立了最相互平等的关系，这正是由于这种关系的基础是马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的正确原则。”
    评论指出，“我们两国之间的互相访问现在已经成为传统，它们体现了密切的友谊和联系，并有助于进一步加强这一友谊。”
    评论说，“我国人民同情、钦佩和高兴地注视着伟大的中国人民已经取得和正在取得的伟大成就，并且把这些成就看作是自己的成就。中国的每一个成就都是对美帝国主义反对中华人民共和国、与中国人民疯狂为敌的侵略阴谋的打击。同时，中国人民的成就也是世界上所有反帝革命力量的成就，使全世界各国人民感到高兴，提高了中华人民共和国在国际舞台上的威信。社会主义中国现在已经变成一个强大的和进步的国家，在世界革命和进步的发展进程中享有巨大的国际声誉和起着巨大的作用。在当前条件下，没有社会主义中国的参加，就没有也不可能有重要的国际问题能够得到解决。中华人民共和国站在各国人民反对帝国主义和现代修正主义斗争的最前线”。
    新华社地拉那二十七日电　阿尔巴尼亚报纸两天来都以巨大篇幅刊登由劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议主席穆罕默德·谢胡率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团访问中国的消息。

    这两家报纸都刊登了中共云南省委第一书记阎红彦、云南省省长周兴二十六日晚上设宴招待代表团的消息。两报还在头版显著地位刊登了中国女青年向谢胡同志献花的传真照片。
    《人民之声报》二十七日在第四版以大半版篇幅发表了题为《伟大的中国人民在社会主义道路上奋勇前进》的编辑部文章。《团结报》刊登了一篇有关中国的特稿：《新拉萨》。
