    Tear off the Painted Skin of "Upright Officials"
    Soldier of a certain unit of the Air Force of the People's Liberation Army Li Gengchen
    After reading "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," my heart was filled with rage. Comrade Wu Han so brazenly distorts history, using the past to criticize the present, forcing us to stand up and resolutely fight back. He repeatedly says that Hai Rui was a "clean official" who "stood on the side of the peasants," saying that he was "upright and honest," "opposed" bad people and bad things, "supported" good people and good things, and so on, and also called on people to "study Hai Rui, learn from Hai Rui." This is all a pack of lies.
    Chairman Mao has long taught us: "In class society, everyone lives in a definite class position, and all kinds of thinking are stamped with the brand of a class." Hai Rui, this loyal subject and filial son of the feudal emperors, the running dog and lackey of the landlord class, could he possibly be a supra-class figure detached from this rule? No! He can only be the political representative of the landlord class, he can only serve the feudal landlord class politically, and he will never "plead for the people," and will never speak for the working people. No matter how Comrade Wu Han rack his brains to prettify and exaggerate Hai Rui, we, the workers, peasants, and soldiers, have our own views on the evaluation of "upright officials."
    Take my family as an example. Before liberation, the puppet Baozhang Yao Kewen used vicious tactics to seize two strong laborers from my family, on whom we depended for our livelihood, and also embezzled that pitiful so-called "family settlement allowance for strong laborers," forcing my family to be ruined and our family members scattered. My grandfather was so angry that he disregarded everything and went to the puppet Baozhang to reason and demand the return of the people. As a result, he was kicked by him, vomiting blood, and collapsing to the ground. After being carried home, my grandfather suffered from illness, poverty, and sorrow, and soon died with grievances. Later, my grandmother heard some people say that the puppet district chief was an "impartial" "clear sky," so she went to the puppet district headquarters with full hope to cry out her grievances and lodge a complaint. Unexpectedly, this "clear sky" official protected other officials, and not only did he not judge the puppet Baozhang for illegally arresting people and embezzling the "family settlement allowance for strong laborers," but instead said that my family was disrupting military service and making trouble unreasonably, and dragged my grandmother out of the "court." Look, this is the landlord and bourgeois "upright official" whom Comrade Wu Han says wholeheartedly serves the people, this is their "pleading for the people"! Comrade Wu Han, may I ask, on which class's standpoint did you say those words?
    People can't help but ask: Why does Comrade Wu Han work so hard to promote a "clean official" that even he himself would not believe in its existence? Let's tear off the painted skin and see! It turns out that Comrade Wu Han is not confused, but has a very vicious political purpose. Through the mouth of Hai Rui, he clears the way for the right-leaning opportunists who were then anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist, cheers them on, and uses the mouth of Hai Rui to vent his anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist poison.
    Tell Comrade Wu Han that the era in which we workers, peasants, and soldiers were fooled by "historians" like you is gone forever! Mao Zedong Thought has brightened our eyes, giving us theory and the ability to distinguish fragrant flowers from poisonous weeds. You use the mouth of Hai Rui to scold our Party and socialism, which just proves once again that the Party is wise and correct, and that socialism is infinitely bright and beautiful. Contrary to your wishes, we will support the Party even more and love socialism even more.

    撕破“清官”的画皮
    解放军空军某部战士　李庚辰
    看了《海瑞骂皇帝》和《海瑞罢官》，心都要气炸了。吴晗同志如此明目张胆地歪曲历史，借古非今，逼得我们不能不站出来坚决地反击了。他口口声声说什么海瑞是“站在农民一边”的“清官”，说他“清廉正直”，“反对”坏人坏事，“支持”好人好事，等等，又号召人们“研究海瑞，学习海瑞”，这完全是骗人的鬼话。
    毛主席早就教导我们说：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”海瑞，这个封建帝王的忠臣孝子，地主阶级的奴才走狗，难道能是离开这个规律的超阶级的人物？不！他只能是地主阶级的政治代表，只能为封建地主阶级政治服务，而决不会“为民请命”，决不会代表劳动人民说话。不管吴晗同志如何挖空心思地替海瑞涂脂抹粉、吹破牛皮，关于“清官”的评价，我们工农兵群众是自有见解的。
    就以我家为例吧。解放前，伪保长姚克温狠施毒计，一次抓走我家赖以维持生活的两个壮丁，还把那一点可怜的所谓“壮丁安家费”也侵吞掉了，逼得我家家破人亡，妻离子散。我爷爷气愤不过，就不顾一切去找伪保长讲理要人，结果，又被他一脚踢得口吐鲜血，昏倒在地。抬回家以后，爷爷伤病贫愁，不久即含冤死去。后来，奶奶听一些人说伪区长是“铁面无情”的“青天”，就抱着满腔希望跑到伪区部喊冤告状。不想这个“青天”大老爷，官官相卫，不但不判伪保长非“法”抓人、侵吞壮丁“安家费”，竟说我家破坏兵役、无理取闹，连拖带拉地把奶奶赶出了“公堂”。看吧，这就是被吴晗同志说成是全心全意为百姓办事的地主资产阶级的“清官”，这就是他们的“为民请命”！请问吴晗，你到底是站在什么阶级的立场上说的什么话？
    人们不禁要问：吴晗同志为什么要这样卖劲地宣扬一个连他自己也不会相信其存在的“清官”呢？撕破画皮来看吧！原来吴晗同志并不是由于发昏糊涂了，而是有他非常恶毒的政治目的的。他借海瑞之口，为当时的反党反人民反社会主义的右倾机会主义分子鸣锣开道，撑腰打气，借海瑞之口发泄他的反党反人民反社会主义的毒气。
    告诉吴晗同志，我们工农兵被象你这样的“历史家”愚弄的时代一去不复返了！毛泽东思想擦亮了我们的眼睛，使我们有了理论，有了辨别香花毒草的能力。你借海瑞之口大骂我们党、大骂社会主义，正好再一次说明了党的英明正确，社会主义无限光明美好。和你的愿望恰恰相反，我们将更加拥护党，更加热爱社会主义。
