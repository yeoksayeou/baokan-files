    Replacing Heavy Manual Labor, Reducing Working Hours
    Shanghai Develops Automated Passenger Car Washing Machine
    (Xinhua News Agency) Shanghai Railway Bureau workers have recently developed an automated external passenger car washing machine, replacing heavy manual labor.
    In the past, washing a train of passenger cars required twenty to thirty people working hard for twenty minutes. Now, with the automated washing machine, only one person needs seven minutes.
    This external passenger car washing machine uses photoelectric control. It can automatically adjust the distance according to the width and height of the vehicles. It can clean the exterior of various passenger cars. It was developed by Shanghai Railway Bureau workers after drawing on the experience of Wuhan Vehicle Depot workers in manufacturing China's first external passenger car washing machine.
    The successful trial production of the automated passenger car washing machine is also the result of extensive collaboration between many units. Shanghai Yongxin Detergent Factory, Shanghai Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Bureau, Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, Shanghai Industrial Brush Factory, Shanghai No. 1 Water Pump Factory, as well as stations, vehicle depots, locomotive depots, engineering departments, track maintenance departments, telecommunications departments, water and electricity departments, construction departments, train sections, loading and unloading teams, and parts factories within the Shanghai Railway Bureau, have all made contributions.

    代替了繁重的人工劳动，缩短了工作时间
    上海制成自动化客车洗涮机
    据新华社讯上海铁路局职工新近制成一台自动化的客车外部洗涮机，代替了繁重的人工劳动。
    过去洗涮一列客车，需要二三十个人紧张地劳动二十分钟；现在改用了自动化洗涮机，只要一个人花费七分钟就够了。
    这台客车外部洗涮机采用光电控制。它能按照车辆宽度和高低，自动调整距离。可以清洗各种客车的外部，它是上海铁路局职工吸取了武昌车辆段职工制造我国第一台客车外部洗涮机的经验之后制成的。
    自动化客车洗涮机的试制成功，也是许多单位实行大协作的结果。上海永鑫洗涤剂厂，上海机电一局，上海机床厂，上海工业毛刷厂，上海第一水泵厂，以及上海铁路局内部的车站、车辆、机务、工程、工务、电务、水电、建筑、列车段、装卸和配件工厂等单位，都作了贡献。（附图片）
