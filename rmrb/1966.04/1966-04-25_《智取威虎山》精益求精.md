    "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" is a play adapted and created by the Shanghai Peking Opera Troupe in 1958. In 1964, it came to Beijing to participate in the Peking Opera Modern Drama Performance and Observation Conference. At that time, it was welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers and received praise and attention from all aspects. However, they were not satisfied with this. In order to revise the play even better, the playwrights, directors, and actors of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the masses, went to live in the army for three months, creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and humbly listened to opinions from all sides, making major revisions to "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy."
    The newly performed version has removed many digressions, reduced some characters and scenes, and concentrated its efforts on prominently strengthening the heroic image of the main character, Yang Zirong. It especially pays attention to using literary and musical means to portray his wholeheartedly loyal revolutionary spirit and brilliant character. Through the depiction of the third scene, "Snowy Field Reconnaissance," the fourth scene, "Formulating a Plan," the fifth scene, "Fighting the Tiger Up the Mountain," the sixth scene, "In the Tiger Hall," the eighth scene, "Delivering Intelligence by Trick," and the tenth scene, "Meeting at the Hundred Chicken Banquet," this hero is placed in sharp struggles against the enemy, warmly praising his heroic and tenacious spirit and his noble quality of boundless loyalty to the Party and the people, making the ideological thread of this hero even clearer. At the same time, it also strengthened the portrayal of the commander, Shao Jianbo; the role of Li Qiyong, as a representative figure of the masses of Jia Pi Gou, has also been strengthened. In short, the revised "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" has been significantly improved, both ideologically and artistically. Through vivid artistic images, it more prominently praises Chairman Mao's thought on people's war; it more prominently praises the fighting spirit of the commanders and fighters of the Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who are brave, resourceful, and unafraid of sacrifice. There are also many innovations and creations in art, and the artistic appeal has also been strengthened compared to the past. "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" has reappeared before the audience with a brand-new look, and the Shanghai Peking Opera Troupe is still continuing to listen to opinions from all sides, further refining and improving it.

    《智取威虎山》精益求精
    《智取威虎山》是上海京剧院在一九五八年改编创作的剧目。一九六四年曾来京参加京剧现代戏观摩演出大会，当时受到工农兵群众的欢迎和各方面的好评与重视。但他们并不以此为满足。为了把这出戏修改得更好，《智取威虎山》的编剧、导演、演员在党的领导和群众的支持下，又去部队生活了三个月，活学活用毛主席著作，虚心听取各方面的意见，对《智取威虎山》进行了较大的加工修改。
    新演出本删去了许多枝蔓，减少了一些人物和场次，集中力量突出地加强了主要人物杨子荣的英雄形象，特别注意运用文学、音乐手段，来刻划他赤胆忠心的革命精神和光辉性格。通过第三场《雪地侦察》、第四场《定计》、第五场《打虎上山》、第六场《威虎厅上》、第八场《计送情报》、第十场《会师百鸡宴》等戏的描写，让这个英雄处在尖锐的对敌斗争中，热情地歌颂了他的英勇顽强、对党对人民无限忠诚的高尚品质，使这位英雄的思想脉络更加鲜明。同时也加强了对指挥员少剑波的塑造；作为夹皮沟群众代表人物李奇勇的戏也加重了。总之，修改后的《智取威虎山》，不论在思想上或艺术上都有了显著的提高。它通过生动的艺术形象，更突出地歌颂了毛主席的人民战争的思想；更加突出地歌颂了毛泽东思想武装起来的解放军指战员那种英勇机智，不怕牺牲的斗争精神。在艺术上也有很多革新创造，艺术感染力也较前加强了。《智取威虎山》以崭新的面貌再度与观众见面了，上海京剧院还在继续听取各方面的意见，进一步加工修改，精益求精。
