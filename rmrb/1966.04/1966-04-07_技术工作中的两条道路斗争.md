    The two-road struggle in technical work
    If proletarian ideology does not occupy the technical field, bourgeois ideology will. Only by highlighting proletarian politics can technical work have the correct direction. ...
    In the past, we thought that in state-owned enterprises, the problem of ownership had been solved, the factory was under the leadership of the Party, and we only needed to bury ourselves in production; now it seems that this was a very wrong view. In fact, the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads still exists in all aspects of the factory's work.
    The struggle between the two roads is most clearly reflected in the technical departments. Within our factory's technical team, there used to be serious bourgeois ideology. For example, many technicians were superstitious about books and foreigners; some regarded technology as private property, blockaded and monopolized it, even committed fraud and competed for fame and profit; there was a lack of democracy in technology, and the revolutionary enthusiasm of many young people was suppressed, and so on. Under the rampant bourgeois ideology, the factory's technical work has long been unable to develop in a socialist direction. Product designs have remained almost unchanged for more than a decade. Some people described it as "the old copying foreigners, the new copying the old, copying back and forth is still at the level of the 1940s, crawling behind others."
    What is the fundamental reason? It lies in the fact that the leadership of technical work has not highlighted politics, and has not grasped the struggle between the two roads in technical work. We have mystified technology, thinking that we are laymen, and have given up leading technical work. We have not realized that in the technical field, if proletarian ideology does not occupy it, bourgeois ideology will.
    In the past year or two, we have begun to strengthen political leadership over the technical departments, vigorously grasping the revolutionization of the technical team, and organizing everyone to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works. As a result, the spiritual outlook of the technical team has undergone great changes. Last year, we comprehensively completed nearly one hundred sets of new product design tasks, completed twenty-six key scientific research projects, and achieved thirty-seven major technological innovation projects.
    Facts fully show that highlighting politics gives technical work the correct direction, and the ideological style of technical personnel will be completely renewed. In the past, everyone sat in buildings to design; now they go to hydropower station construction sites, working and designing at the same time. In the past, some people buried themselves in writing books indoors, unable to write useful books; now they leave the hospital and combine with workers, achieving good results. Technological democracy has also been greatly promoted. In the past, a few people had the final say, and young technicians had no say; now everyone handles affairs according to Mao Zedong Thought and ventures to gain experience and find methods through repeated practice. In the past, technicians believed that there was no "big S" (integral symbol) or "bean sprouts" (differential symbol) in Chairman Mao's works, and that technical problems could not be solved; now they realize that they can learn standpoints, viewpoints, and methods from Chairman Mao's works, which can be used to transform their own thinking and guide the solution of problems in technical work.
    In recent years of practice, we have realized that highlighting politics is fundamentally a question of direction, that is, a question of the struggle between the two roads. To highlight politics in technical work is to resolutely oppose capitalist and revisionist technical lines, eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology, and make technical work develop in a socialist direction.

    技术工作中的两条道路斗争
    无产阶级思想不去占领技术领域，资产阶级思想必去占领。只有突出无产阶级政治，技术工作才有正确方向。……
    过去，我们以为在国营企业里，所有制问题已经解决，工厂是党在领导，只要埋头把生产搞好就行了；现在看来，这是很错误的看法。事实上，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，在工厂企业的各项工作中依然存在。
    两条道路的斗争在技术部门反映得最明显。我们厂的技术队伍内部，过去存在着严重的资产阶级思想。比如不少技术人员迷信书本，迷信洋人；有些人把技术看成私有财产，封锁垄断，甚至弄虚作假，争名夺利；技术上不民主，有不少青年人的革命积极性受到压制，等等。在资产阶级思想泛滥的情况下，工厂的技术工作长期以来不能按照社会主义方向发展。产品设计十几年来几乎原封未动，有人形容是“老人抄洋人，新人抄老人，抄来抄去还是四十年代的水平，跟在别人后边爬行。”
    根本原因在哪里呢？在于对技术工作的领导没有突出政治，没有在技术工作中抓紧两条道路的斗争。我们把技术神秘化了，以为自己是外行，放弃了对技术工作的领导，没有认识到技术领域，无产阶级思想不去占领，资产阶级思想必去占领。
    近一两年来，我们开始对技术部门加强政治领导，大抓技术队伍的革命化，组织大家活学活用毛主席著作。结果，技术队伍的精神面貌发生很大的变化，去年全面完成了新产品设计任务近一百套，完成了二十六个重点科研课题，实现了三十七项重大技术革新项目。
    事实充分说明，突出政治，技术工作才有正确的方向，技术人员的思想作风才会焕然一新。过去大家坐在大楼里设计；现在到水电站工地上，边劳动，边设计。过去有的人埋头在室内写书，写不出有用的书；现在出院和工人三结合，取得了很好的成果。技术民主也大为发扬了，过去少数人说了算，青年技术人员没有发言权；现在大家按照毛泽东思想办事，从反复实践中去闯经验，找办法。过去，技术人员认为毛主席著作里没有“大S”（积分符号），没有“豆芽菜”（微分符号），不能解决技术问题；现在认识到从毛主席著作中可以学到立场、观点和方法，用来改造自己的思想，用来指导解决技术工作中的问题。
    在近年来的实践中，我们认识到，突出政治，根本上是一个方向问题，也就是两条道路斗争的问题。在技术工作中突出政治，就是要坚决反对资本主义和修正主义的技术路线，肃清资产阶级思想影响，使技术工作按照社会主义的方向发展。
