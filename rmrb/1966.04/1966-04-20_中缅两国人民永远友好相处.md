    Chairman Liu Shaoqi has concluded his friendly visit to Myanmar and once again returned home laden with the friendship of the Myanmar people. Through Chairman Liu Shaoqi's second visit to Myanmar, the people of China and Myanmar relived the deep "Pauk-Phaw" (fraternal) friendship that has long existed between us, and promoted the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries that have been developing smoothly since the establishment of diplomatic relations.

    Myanmar was the first country to conclude a treaty of friendship and non-aggression with China. The Sino-Myanmar Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression signed in 1960 was the first such treaty of peace between Asian countries. We not only fixed the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries in the form of a treaty, but also faithfully fulfilled this treaty, providing a good example of good-neighborly and friendly relations for all countries.

    Myanmar was also the first country to resolve border issues with our country through friendly consultation. China and Myanmar share a border of more than two thousand kilometers. In the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual concession, the governments of the two countries fairly and reasonably resolved the complex border issues that had existed for more than a hundred years, and safeguarded and strengthened the unity between our two countries. For more than ten years, the border between our two countries has always been a peaceful border, and the border residents of the two countries have always lived in friendship. This has had a profound impact on how Asian countries handle border issues left over from history.

    Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Myanmar, economic, cultural, and technological cooperation has also continued to develop. The governments of the two countries have implemented projects such as trade agreements, air transport agreements, postal agreements, and economic and technical cooperation agreements, all in the spirit of equality and mutual benefit, and mutual support, closely cooperating and promoting the common development of the economies of the two countries. In recent years, cultural exchanges between China and Myanmar have also become increasingly frequent, and the close exchanges of envoys from the two countries have formed a strong bond of Sino-Myanmar friendship.

    The steady development of good-neighborly friendship and mutual assistance and cooperation between China and Myanmar is the result of both sides conscientiously implementing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by the governments of the two countries. In handling all issues between the two countries, neither the Chinese nor the Myanmar leaders ever seek to benefit themselves at the expense of others, nor do they impose their own opinions on the other party. We have truly achieved mutual respect and equal treatment. This has laid the foundation for the implementation of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

    The Sino-Myanmar Joint Communiqué pointed out: "Both sides believe that the newly independent countries of Asia and Africa are faced with the common task of safeguarding national independence and building their own countries. Both sides emphasize that achieving economic independence is an important condition for maintaining and consolidating political independence." The Joint Communiqué's emphasis on the economic independence of Asian and African countries is extremely far-sighted. The vast majority of Asian and African countries, including China, have suffered from long-term imperialist aggression and plunder. Facts have proven that after achieving political independence, Asian and African countries must also achieve economic independence. Chairman Liu Shaoqi recently said in Myanmar: "Without true economic independence, political independence is incomplete and not consolidated. If the anti-imperialist struggle is not carried through to the end, the national independence of Asian and African countries will not be guaranteed, and the achievements of economic construction cannot be maintained." This is the practical experience of the Chinese people and the practical experience of many Asian and African countries. Today, in the Asian and African regions, imperialist and neo-colonialist forces have not yet been completely driven out. On the contrary, they are still counterattacking and trying to regain lost ground. Carrying the anti-imperialist struggle through to the end, thoroughly, completely, and cleanly eliminating all the forces of imperialism, consolidating national independence, and developing national economies are the common tasks facing Asian and African countries.

    China and Myanmar are connected by mountains and rivers, and the people of the two countries are "Pauk-Phaw" (fraternal) as close as brothers. Continuously enhancing the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries not only fully conforms to the common aspirations and interests of the people of the two countries, but also is completely beneficial to maintaining peace in Asia. Mutual visits by leaders of China and Myanmar are of great significance for enhancing friendly cooperation between the two countries. As Chairman Liu Shaoqi concludes his visit to Myanmar, we sincerely wish: the people of China and Myanmar will live in friendship from generation to generation.

### 中缅两国人民永远友好相处

    中缅两国人民永远友好相处
    刘少奇主席已经结束对缅甸的友好访问，又一次满载着缅甸人民的友谊回国了。通过刘少奇主席的再度访问缅甸，中缅两国人民重温了我们之间久已存在的深厚的“胞波”情谊，并促进了两国自从建交以来一直顺利发展的友好合作关系。
    缅甸是第一个同中国缔结友好和互不侵犯条约的国家。一九六○年签订的中缅友好和互不侵犯条约，是亚洲国家间出现的第一个这样的和平条约。我们不仅把两国之间的友好合作关系用条约的形式固定下来，而且忠实地履行这个条约，为各国提供了睦邻友好关系的良好范例。
    缅甸也是第一个同我国通过友好协商解决边界问题的国家。中国和缅甸有两千多公里长的边界。两国政府本着互谅互让的精神，公平合理地解决了已经存在一百多年的复杂的边界问题，维护和加强了我们两国之间的团结。十多年来，我们两国的边界始终是和平的边界，两国边境居民始终友好相处。这对于亚洲各国之间处理历史上遗留下来的边界问题，产生了极为深远的影响。
    中缅两国建交以来，在经济文化和技术合作方面，也不断地向前发展。两国政府执行贸易协定、航空运输协定、邮政协定和经济技术合作协定等项目，都本着平等互利，互相支援的精神，密切合作，促进了两国经济的共同发展。近年来中缅两国之间的文化交流也日益频繁，两国使者的亲密往来，形成了中缅友谊的有力的纽带。
    中缅两国睦邻友好和互助合作关系的稳步发展，是双方认真执行两国政府所共同倡导的和平共处五项原则的结果。中缅两国领导人在处理两国之间的一切问题时，任何一方都从不损人利己，从不把自己的意见强加于另一方。我们真正做到了互相尊重，平等相待。这就为和平共处五项原则的贯彻奠定了基础。
    中缅联合公报指出：“双方认为，亚非新独立的国家都面临着维护民族独立和建设自己国家的共同任务。双方强调，获得经济独立是维护和巩固政治独立的重要条件。”联合公报强调亚非国家的经济独立，是极有远见的。包括中国在内，绝大部分的亚非国家都遭受过帝国主义的长期侵略和掠夺。事实证明，亚非国家在取得了政治上的独立之后，还必须取得经济上的独立。刘少奇主席最近在缅甸曾经这样说过：“没有真正的经济独立，政治上的独立是不完全的，也是不巩固的。不把反帝斗争进行到底，亚非国家的民族独立就没有保障，经济建设的成果也不能保持。”这是中国人民的切身体会，也是许多亚非国家的切身体会。今天，在亚非地区，帝国主义和新老殖民主义势力还远没有被彻底赶走。相反，它们还在反扑，还力图夺回已经丧失的阵地。把反帝斗争进行到底，彻底、全部、干净地肃清帝国主义的一切势力，巩固民族独立，发展民族经济，这是亚非国家面临的共同任务。
    中缅两国山水相连，两国人民是亲如手足的“胞波”。不断增进我们两国之间的友好合作关系，不仅完全符合两国人民的共同愿望和利益，也完全有利于维护亚洲的和平。中缅两国领导人的相互访问，对于增进两国之间的友好合作，具有十分重大的意义。在刘少奇主席结束对缅甸的访问的时候，我们衷心地祝愿：中缅两国人民世世代代地友好相处下去。
