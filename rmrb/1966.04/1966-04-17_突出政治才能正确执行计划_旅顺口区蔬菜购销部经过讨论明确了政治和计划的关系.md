    Emphasizing Politics is the Only Way to Correctly Implement Plans
    Lushunkou District Vegetable Purchasing and Marketing Department Clarifies the Relationship Between Politics and Plans Through Discussion
    Not long ago, the Lushunkou District Vegetable Purchasing and Marketing Department of Lüda City, Liaoning Province, launched a discussion on the relationship between politics and plans. Initially, some people believed that fulfilling the planned targets was serving the people and emphasizing politics. Others believed that fulfilling the planned targets contributed to the country and eliminated the "loss-making" label, giving them a strong backbone and a respectable image, making everything they said sound good – and this was emphasizing politics. Still others thought that fulfilling the planned targets benefited the country with money, the enterprise with awards, and individuals with bonuses, so that all three parties were benefited, and this was emphasizing politics.
    However, more people had different views. They believed that the fulfillment of the plan should not be measured solely by the percentage of targets completed, but should be measured from the three perspectives of politics, production, and the masses, first and foremost to see whether it conformed to the fundamental interests of the people. To illustrate this point, they cited vivid examples, both positive and negative.
    In the past, whenever the planned targets were not met by the end of the month, the Party Secretary would lead a group of people to the production teams to organize a large amount of vegetables for the market; the manager would lead another group to the retail stores to forcibly promote sales. As a result, the wholesale market was bustling with traffic and crowded with people, and the masses said, "The vegetable company puts on a 'big show' when it fails to meet its plan." In 1965 alone, they put on seven "big shows." Although the plan was "completed," the retail department lost more than 1,000 yuan, and the masses could not eat good vegetables. What kind of glory was that, and what kind of backbone was strengthened?
    Since 1962, every spring, this purchasing and marketing department has transferred a batch of fresh vegetables to several fraternal cities in the Northeast. In the transfer process, they adopted methods such as upgrading quality and raising prices to obtain unreasonable profits. How could this resemble a socialist enterprise!
    After these examples were presented, many employees and cadres said: If politics is not emphasized in the completion of the plan, and the Party's policies are not implemented, and only the indicators are considered, the enterprise itself has completed the plan, but it has affected production, harmed the interests of the masses, affected relations with fraternal units, violated the Party's policies, and caused losses to the country. Isn't this the capitalist business ideology and style at play? To truly emphasize politics, in the process of implementing the plan, we should resolutely implement the Party's policies, adhere to starting from the interests of the people and the interests of the country, and not just from the interests of individuals or our own unit.
    They also cited some examples of emphasizing politics in the implementation of the plan. Before the Spring Festival of 1964, the purchasing and marketing department received instructions from its superiors to support the disaster area in Hebei with 400 tons of vegetables. Based on this instruction, the Party branch first conducted political mobilization for all employees, calling on all employees to send good vegetables to the class brothers in the disaster area, and to bring the care of the Party and Chairman Mao to the class brothers. It also further improved ideological work, greatly arousing the political enthusiasm of all employees. They stayed at the railway station for seven days and seven nights, eating at the railway station, regardless of the freezing weather, and sent 47 carloads of cabbage on time with guaranteed quality and quantity, exceeding the support by 120 tons. At the same time, they also saved more than 2,000 yuan in various expenses for the disaster area, and successfully completed the transfer task. After receiving the vegetables, the class brothers in the disaster area wrote letters of thanks. The letter said: "We have received the festival vegetables you sent. Thank you for the care of the Party and Chairman Mao, and thank you for the care of the people of Lüda."
    Through similar positive and negative examples, people further saw the power of politics and understood that only by emphasizing proletarian politics can socialist commercial work be done well. If we deviate from emphasizing politics when implementing the plan, we will lose our way and embark on the wrong path.

    突出政治才能正确执行计划
    旅顺口区蔬菜购销部经过讨论明确了政治和计划的关系
    不久前，辽宁省旅大市旅顺口区蔬菜购销部，就政治和计划的关系，展开了一场讨论。开始，有的人认为，完成了计划指标，就是为人民服务，就是突出了政治。也有的人认为，计划指标完成了，对国家有贡献，不戴“赔钱”的帽子，腰板硬了，脸上光彩，说什么也好听，这就是突出了政治。还有些人认为，计划指标完成了，国家得了钱，企业得奖状，个人得奖金，三者都有利，这就是突出政治。
    但是，更多的人却有着不同的看法。他们认为，对计划的完成，不能单纯以完成指标的百分比来衡量，要用政治、生产、群众三大观点来衡量，首先要看是不是符合人民群众的根本利益。为了说明这一观点，他们举出了正反两面的活事例。
    过去，每当月末完不成计划指标时，书记便带领一批人马到生产队组织蔬菜大量登市；经理带领另一批人马，到零售商店硬性推销。结果，搞得批发市场车水马龙，人群拥挤，群众说，“蔬菜公司完不成计划就‘唱大戏’。”仅一九六五年，他们就唱了七次“大戏”，虽然“完成”了计划，但零售部门损失了一千多元，群众吃不上好菜。这算什么光彩，硬的是什么腰板？
    一九六二年以来，每年春季，这个购销部都要向东北几个兄弟城市调运一批鲜菜。在调运中，他们采取了提等提价等办法，捞取了不合理的利润。这哪里象个社会主义企业的样子！
    这些事例摆出后，不少职工、干部说：在完成计划中不突出政治，不贯彻执行党的政策，单纯从指标看，企业本身是完成了计划，但却影响了生产，损害了群众的利益，影响了同兄弟单位的关系，违犯了党的政策，给国家造成了损失。这岂不是资本主义经营思想作风在作怪吗？真正突出政治，在执行计划过程中，就应该坚决贯彻党的政策，坚持从人民的利益国家的利益出发，而不能只从个人或本单位的利益出发。
    他们也举出了在执行计划中突出了政治的一些事例。一九六四年春节前，购销部接到上级指示，要支援河北灾区四百吨蔬菜。党支部根据这一指示，首先对全体职工进行了政治动员，号召全体职工一定要给灾区的阶级兄弟送去好菜，把党和毛主席对灾区人民的关怀带给阶级兄弟，并且进一步做好思想工作，大大激发了全体职工的政治热情。他们不顾冰天雪地，七天七夜住在火车站，吃在火车站，保质保量地按时发去了四十七车白菜，超额支援一百二十吨。同时，还给灾区节省了各项费用两千多元，胜利完成调运任务。灾区的阶级兄弟收到菜后，写来了感谢信。信上说：“我们收到了你们送来的节日菜，感谢党和毛主席的关怀，感谢旅大人民对我们的关怀。”
    通过类似这样的正反面事例，人们进一步看清了政治的威力；懂得了：只有突出无产阶级政治，才能做好社会主义商业工作。如果在执行计划时离开了突出政治，就会迷失方向，走上邪路。
