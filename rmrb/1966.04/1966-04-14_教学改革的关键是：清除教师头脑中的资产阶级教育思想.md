    The Key to Teaching Reform is to Eliminate the Bourgeois Educational Thought in Teachers' Minds
    Simply Grasping Professional Skills Leads Nowhere
    In 1963 and 1964, we carried out two teaching reforms, but the results were not significant. The main reason was that the school leaders did not emphasize politics and grasp the ideological revolutionization of people, but instead focused solely on professional skills. At that time, it was believed that by tightly grasping professional skills and strictly controlling the system, teaching reform would take off. But things didn't go as planned. When the pressure was on, there would be some changes; when the pressure was off, there would be no movement. Sometimes, teachers and leaders even butted heads: you say yours, I do mine; you make the pronouncements, I do the work. It was common to hear some teachers whispering behind their backs: "What 'less is more,' 'heuristic teaching,' if it doesn't improve teaching quality, it doesn't count." In short, with the existence of various individualistic thoughts and bourgeois educational ideas, how could the path of teaching reform be successful?
    The two failed experiences gave us a great education. Chairman Mao taught us: politics is the commander, the soul, and the human factor is primary. The People's Liberation Army creatively studies and applies Chairman Mao's writings, and integrates political and ideological work into the entire army's work, making it an invincible army. But our work was the opposite. We mistakenly believed that grasping ideological and political work was abstract, while grasping teaching tasks was concrete; grasping ideological and political work was long-term, while grasping teaching skills was realistic. After studying Chairman Mao's writings and learning from the political and ideological work experience of the People's Liberation Army, we gradually understood the dialectical relationship between politics and professional skills, between people and things, and truly realized the great significance of politics commanding professional skills and the decisive factor of people. To do a good job in teaching reform, we must first emphasize politics, take class struggle as the key link, do a good job in people's work, and revolutionize the thinking of teachers. From then on, we came to the conclusion: grasping professional skills to promote teaching reform, this path leads nowhere.
    When Thought Changes, Teaching Can Change
    In the second half of 1964, we emphasized correctly handling the relationship between politics and professional skills, and between being Red and expert, shifting the focus of teaching reform to grasping the ideological revolutionization of teachers, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the minds of teachers, thereby promoting the educational revolution and promoting teaching reform. First, we started with transforming the world outlook, solving the fundamental question of "serving whom." Chairman Mao said: "The question of for whom is a fundamental question, a matter of principle." "If this fundamental question is not resolved, many other questions will not be easily resolved." Therefore, we and the teachers, together, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's writings and instructions on educational work, looking at how Chairman Mao taught and how we thought and practiced, comparing and examining ourselves. Our leading cadres first examined their own thoughts. In the past, we often verbally shouted to conscientiously implement the Party's education policy and run revolutionary schools, but in reality, what we said and what we thought were two different things: we either wanted to show personal "prestige," or we wanted to promote the school's "reputation," or even achieve both fame and fortune. The examination of the leaders promoted the examination of the teachers. Tendencies such as pursuing fame and fortune, being worried about gains and losses, fearing hardship and fatigue, teaching knowledge but not teaching people, were all exposed at once. After airing our thoughts, everyone agreed that to reform teaching, we must first reform people, and to reform people, we must first reform the heart. If the heart is not Red and the will is not firm, the path of teaching reform cannot be taken, and even if it is taken, it is like a woman with bound feet walking, either swaying or stumbling.
    With the emphasis on politics in ideology, people's attitudes towards teaching reform were different. Running revolutionary socialist schools and being revolutionary teachers has begun to become the conscious demand of teachers. There were fewer teachers who originally had resistance to teaching reform; some young teachers with short teaching experience and no experience were no longer bound by the "authority" of old teachers, and they dared to break the rules and regulations in teaching. On the one hand, they studied Chairman Mao's instructions on education work, deeply understood Chairman Mao's educational thought, and on the other hand, started with investigation and research to solve the fear of difficulty in teaching ideology, and at the same time actively listened to other people's classes, or invited others to listen to their own classes, learning from others' strengths to make up for their own shortcomings. Most teachers paid attention to teaching people before teaching books, and together with the students, they went deep into reality, participated in labor, visited the poor and asked about their sufferings, and started with class education to educate students to study for the revolution. After a period of reform, we made a summary, and everyone said: Dazhai's production changes because its ideology changes; our teaching changes because our ideology changes. If we continue to do this, teaching reform will definitely produce results. From then on, the school leaders initially tasted the sweetness of grasping politics to promote professional skills and grasping ideology to promote teaching reform.
    Methodology is Unified with World Outlook
    In the past, our teaching reform was to change methods for the sake of methods. We changed it back and forth, but it didn't get better. For example, most teachers paid attention to "less" in their lectures, but they did not pay attention to "essence"; to be heuristic, they asked students too many questions. As a result, the teaching effect not only did not improve, but declined somewhat. Therefore, some teachers believed that the new teaching method was not feasible and had to adopt the old teaching method. We took this question and organized teachers to study Chairman Mao's writings again. Chairman Mao taught us that methodology is unified with world outlook, and improving working methods and transforming thinking methods are mutually influential. The teachers realized that there were ideological issues in methodological issues, and they were also full of the struggle between two educational ideologies, which strengthened their confidence in teaching reform. After the Chinese language teaching and research group studied "On Practice," and understood the principle that knowledge comes from practice, in improving composition teaching, they actively guided students to go out of the classroom, out of the school, visit old poor peasants with deep hatred, often participate in labor within their ability, and also targeted the living ideas existing among students of despising agricultural production and not cherishing the fruits of labor, organized them to visit the Suoma advanced production brigade, and linked teaching with the three great revolutionary movements, overcoming the phenomenon of teaching being divorced from politics, divorced from reality, and divorced from the masses. In the process of practice, they also guided students to carefully observe, think, distinguish right from wrong, and put forward inspiring questions to help them elevate perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge, and combine objective things, thinking, and language, which improved writing quality. We summarized and exchanged these experiences in a timely manner, so that teachers who originally believed that studying Chairman Mao's writings could not learn teaching methods and those who one-sidedly understood less and more, and the heuristic style had changed their thinking, gradually realizing the consistency of changing thinking and changing methods, and also understood that they must change thinking in order to change methods.

### 教学改革的关键是：清除教师头脑中的资产阶级教育思想

    教学改革的关键是：
    清除教师头脑中的资产阶级教育思想
    单纯抓业务，此路不通
    一九六三年和一九六四年，我们进行了两次教学改革，效果不大。主要原因是学校领导没有突出政治，抓人的思想革命化，而是就业务抓业务。当时认为，把业务抓得紧紧的，制度卡得严严的，教学改革就会迈开步子。但事与愿违。抓得紧了就改一改，抓得松了就不动。有时教师同领导甚至顶起牛来：你说你的，我做我的；说是由你，做是由我。常听到一些教师在背地议论：“什么少而精、启发式，提不高教学质量总不算数”。总之，存在各种各样的个人主义思想和资产阶级教育思想，教学改革的路子怎么能走得通呢？
    两次失败的教训，给了我们很大的教育。毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂，人的因素第一。解放军活学活用毛主席著作，把政治思想工作贯串到整个军队工作中去，就成为一支战无不胜的军队。而我们的工作却正好相反。我们错误地认为抓思想政治工作是抽象的，抓教学任务是具体的；抓思想政治工作是长远的，抓教学业务是现实的。学习了毛主席著作，学习了解放军政治思想工作经验后，才逐渐理解政治和业务、人和物的辩证关系，真正认识到政治统帅业务的伟大意义和人是决定性的因素。要搞好教学改革，必须首先突出政治，以阶级斗争为纲，做好人的工作，使教师思想革命化。从此，我们得出一条结论：抓业务促教改，此路不通。
    思想变，教学才能变
    一九六四年后半年，我们重视了正确处理政治与业务、红与专的关系，把教学改革重点转向抓教师思想革命化，用毛泽东思想武装教师的头脑，从而推进教育革命，促进教学改革。首先从改造世界观入手，解决“为谁服务”这个根本问题。毛主席说：“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”“这个根本问题不解决，其他许多问题也就不易解决。”于是，我们和教师们一起，反复学习毛主席著作和有关教育工作的指示，看毛主席是怎样教导的，我们是怎样想、怎样实践的，对照检查自己。我们领导干部首先检查了自己的思想。过去，口头上也常喊认真贯彻党的教育方针，办革命化的学校，实际嘴里说的和心里想的两个样：不是想显个人“威信”，就是想扬学校“名声”，或者来个名利双收。领导的检查，促进了教师的检查，什么追逐名利、患得患失、怕苦怕累、教书不教人等倾向，一下子揭露了出来。经过亮思想，大家一致认为：要改教必须先改人，要改人必须先改心。心不红，志不坚，教改的路子就无法走，就是走起来，也是象小脚女人走路，不是摇摇摆摆，就是跌跌撞撞。
    思想上突出了政治，人们对教学改革的态度就不一样了。办革命化的社会主义学校，当革命化的教师，已开始成为教师的自觉要求。原来对教学改革有抵触情绪的教师少了；一些教龄短、没经验的青年教师，不再受老教师的“权威”束缚，也敢于破教学中的清规戒律了。他们一方面学习毛主席关于教育工作的指示，深入领会毛主席的教育思想，另一方面从调查研究入手，解决教学思想上的畏难情绪，同时主动听别人的课，或邀请别人听自己的课，取人之长，补己之短。大多数教师都注意了教书先教人，和学生一起深入实际，参加劳动，访贫问苦，从阶级教育着手，教育学生为革命而学。经过一段改革，我们作了小结，大家说：大寨是思想变，产量变；咱们是思想变，教学变，这样搞下去，教学改革一定会出成果。从此，学校领导才初步尝到了抓政治带业务、抓思想促教改的甜头。
    方法论同世界观是统一的
    过去我们进行教学改革，是就方法改方法，改来改去，改不好。如大部分教师，讲课注意了“少”，但却没有注意“精”；要启发式，就过多地向学生发问。结果，教学效果不但没有提高，反而有所下降。因此，有些教师就认为新教法使不得，行不通，还得采用旧教法。我们带着这个问题，又组织教师学习毛主席著作。毛主席教导我们，方法论同世界观是统一的，改进工作方法同改造思想方法是互为作用的。教师们认识到在方法问题中包含着思想问题，也充满着两种教育思想的斗争，就增强了教改的信心。语文教研组学了《实践论》，懂得了知识来源于实践的道理以后，在改进作文教学中，积极引导学生走出课堂，走出校门，访问苦大仇深的老贫农，经常参加力所能及的劳动，又针对学生当中存在的轻视农业生产和不珍惜劳动果实的活思想，组织他们参观索马先进生产大队，把教学和三大革命运动联系起来，克服教学脱离政治、脱离实际、脱离群众的现象。在实践过程中，又引导学生认真观察、思维，明辨是非，给他们提出带有启发性的问题，帮助他们把感性认识上升到理性认识，把客观事物、思维、语言结合起来，提高了写作质量。我们把这些经验及时进行总结交流，使原来认为学毛主席著作学不到教学方法和片面理解少而精、启发式的教师，思想有了转变，逐步认识到改思想改方法的一致性，而且懂得了必须改思想，才能改方法。
