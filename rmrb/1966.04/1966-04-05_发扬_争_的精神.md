    To realize the revolutionization of the county committee leadership, the primary need is for the county committee's leadership core to have combat unity and ideological consensus. And to achieve this, it is necessary to promote the spirit of "struggle."

    "Struggle" is the concrete embodiment of implementing democratic centralism. Only by engaging in debate on matters of principle can there be a foundation for unity, can we pool everyone's wisdom, and can we better and more comprehensively implement the Party's policies and guidelines.

    In previous years, the members of our county committee were afraid of debate, afraid that disagreements would be difficult to handle, so they felt troubled when encountering contradictions. As a result, in our work we each guarded our own territory; in our thinking, we muddled along. It was truly a case of "the river doesn't interfere with the well."

    Last year, our county committee repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's articles such as "Combat Liberalism" and "On Strengthening the Party Committee System." This study clarified our thinking, broadened our horizons, and made us realize that whether or not to struggle, whether to dare to struggle or to fear struggle, is a matter of mental state and also a matter of worldview. Chairman Mao said: "Opposition and struggle between different ideas within the Party occur constantly... If there were no contradictions and ideological struggles to resolve contradictions within the Party, the Party's life would cease." In accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, over the past year, we have launched more than ten major debates, sometimes debating a single issue repeatedly four or five times, targeting the ideological state of the county committee leadership at different times. Among these were debates over the size of the area for double-cropping rice; debates over the so-called "risk" versus "stability" in promoting superior varieties; and debates over the two types of thinking regarding water conservancy projects—relying on the Dazhai spirit versus relying on state support, and so on.

    This series of "struggles" has led to a consensus in the ideological understanding of the county committee leadership, enhanced unity, and a solid work style. It was precisely because of "struggle" that the lid was lifted on the backwardness of agricultural production in our county, exposing problems that we had previously dared not face squarely (for example, the fact that our county's per-unit grain yield in 1963 was the second-lowest in the entire region), enabling the vast number of cadres and the masses to find the gap and make the determination to work hard and practically. Practice has proven that several issues that were debated have turned into several major breakthroughs, promoting a substantial increase in grain and cotton production last year.

    If there are differences, they must be unified; to unify, there must be struggle; struggle must be reasonable and in line with reality, and this requires finding a basis. Where does the basis come from? The basis comes from two sources: one from Mao Zedong Thought and the instructions of the Central Committee, provincial committees, and regional committees, and the other from reality and from the people. Carrying out "debates" has prompted us to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, prompted us to go down to squat in the fields, and also promoted the revolutionization of the organs.

    Through debate, everyone has brought their initiative into play and enhanced their sense of responsibility. Because the decision on every issue has fully promoted democracy and listened to opinions from all sides, everyone feels responsible for the success or failure of the county's work. Some county committee comrades said: "Having worked here for more than a decade, it is only this year that I have truly stood in my own department and considered the work of the entire county."

    The process from "not struggling" to "struggling," from "fearing struggle" to "daring to struggle," reflects the change in our mental state, and of course, this is only a preliminary change.

### 发扬“争”的精神

    发扬“争”的精神
    实现县委领导革命化，首先是县委领导核心有战斗的团结和思想认识上的一致。而做到这点，必须发扬“争”的精神。
    “争”，是贯彻民主集中制的具体体现。只有在原则问题上展开争论，团结才有基础，才能集中大家的智慧，更好更全面地贯彻执行党的方针政策。
    前几年，我们县委成员之间害怕争论，害怕意见分歧不好办，所以遇到了矛盾就感到为难。结果，工作上是各守一方；思想上得过且过。真正是“河水不犯井水”。
    去年，我们县委反复学了毛主席的《反对自由主义》、《关于健全党委制》等有关文章。这一学，思想明朗了，视野开阔了，认识到争与不争、敢争与怕争，是个精神状态问题，也是世界观问题。毛主席说：“党内不同思想的对立和斗争是经常发生的，……党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。”按照毛主席的教导，一年来我们针对县委领导上不同时期的思想状态，先后开展了十多次的大争论，有时一个问题反复争论了四、五次。其中有对双季稻种植面积的大、小之争；有在推广优良品种上的所谓“险”与“稳”之争；以及兴修水利工程上有靠大寨精神，还是靠国家支援的两种思想之争，等等。
    这一系列的“争”，使得县委领导思想认识一致了，团结增强了，作风踏实了。正是由于“争”，揭开了我县农业生产落后的盖子，把我们原来一直不敢正视的问题（例如我县一九六三年粮食单产在全专区倒数第二的情况）公开了，使广大干部和群众找到了差距，下了苦干实干的决心。实践证明，几个有争论的问题，都变成了几个大突破，促进了去年粮棉大幅度增产。
    有分歧就要统一，要统一就要争；争要言之有理，符合实际，而这就要找根据。根据从哪里来？根据来自两头：一头来自毛主席思想和中央、省、地委指示，一头来自实际、来自人民群众。开展“争论”，促使我们活学活用毛主席著作，促进我们下去蹲点，也促进了机关革命化。
    通过争论，大家发挥了主动性，增强了责任心。由于每一个问题的决定，都充分发扬民主，听取了各方面的意见，因而大家对全县工作好坏，都感到自己有责任。一些县委同志说：“在这里工作十几年了，真正站在自己部门，考虑全县工作，还是从今年开始。”
    从“不争”到“争”，从“怕争”到“敢争”的过程，反映了我们精神状态的变化，当然这也仅仅是初步的变化。
