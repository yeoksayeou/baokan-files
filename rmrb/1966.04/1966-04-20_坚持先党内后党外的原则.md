    Adhere to the Principle of "Party Members First, Then Non-Party Members"
    When implementing the Party's policies and major tasks, we should adhere to the principle of "Party members first, then non-Party members." Doing so does not slow down action; it actually speeds it up. For example, last year, we further implemented the "Forty Articles on Agriculture" and focused on the key to increasing production – promoting grass seeds. Promoting grass seeds was a new endeavor, and the masses initially had some ideological concerns. To better accomplish this arduous task, we first convened a Party member meeting, explained the significance of promoting grass seeds for increasing grain production and realizing the "Forty Articles," analyzed the favorable conditions, and summarized the existing successful experiences. After repeated discussions, we unified our thinking. When Party members themselves had firm convictions, they were no longer hesitant when mobilizing the masses. For instance, the deputy secretary of the branch proactively went deep into the backward teams, took the lead in action after doing ideological work. Other Party members also went deep into their respective teams to lead the masses in action. As a result, all 100+ mu of grass seeds in the entire brigade were sown on time, followed by a mass campaign of high-quality and early management.
    We deeply realize that adhering to the principle of "from within the Party to outside the Party" has the following benefits: First, it can unify thinking and action within the Party, strengthening the combat effectiveness of the branch; second, it can better pool the wisdom of Party members, making the tasks and measures proposed by the branch more in line with the actual situation; third, Party members learn about the Party's guidelines, policies, and major tasks first, enabling them to better play a exemplary role; fourth, it can enhance Party members' sense of organization.

    坚持先党内后党外的原则
    在贯彻党的方针政策和重大任务的时候，应当坚持先党内后党外的原则。这样做，行动不是慢了，而是快了。例如，去年我们这里进一步贯彻“农业纲要四十条”，狠抓增产关键——推广草籽。推广草籽是件新工作，开始群众有些思想问题。为了更好地完成这一艰巨任务，我们就首先召开党员大会，讲明推广草籽对增产粮食、实现“四十条”的意义，分析有利条件，总结已有的成功经验，经过反复讨论，统一了思想。党员自己思想坚定了，动员群众时就不再是犹犹豫豫的。如支部副书记主动深入后进队，在做好思想工作的基础上，带头行动。其他党员也都深入所在队带领群众行动。这样，全大队一百多亩草籽全部按时种好，并接着开展了高质量、早管理的群众性行动。
    我们深深体会到，坚持从党内到党外的原则，有这样几条好处：一、可以使党内思想一致，步调一致，加强支部的战斗力；二、可以更好地集中党员的智慧，使支部提出的任务、措施更符合实际情况；三、党的方针、政策和重大任务，党员先知道，可以更好地发挥模范带头作用；四、可以增强党员的组织观念。
