    Chawado, Secretary-General, Delivers a Comprehensive Report at the Enlarged Meeting of the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association
    U.S. Imperialism and Its Lackeys Cannot Stop the Anti-Imperialist Struggle Mainstream in Asia, Africa, and Latin America; The Afro-Asian Journalists' Association Is Determined to Fight Alongside the People of the World Until Imperialism Is Eliminated
    To Consolidate and Expand the Anti-Imperialist United Front, We Must Expose and Oppose the Sham Revolutionaries Who Collude with U.S. Imperialism
    Xinhua News Agency, April 21st: Chawado, Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association, declared in his comprehensive report at the Fourth Plenary (Enlarged) Meeting of the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association on the 21st that, in the current excellent global anti-imperialist situation, the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association will hold even higher the banner of anti-imperialist struggle and, together with the people of Asia, Africa, and the world, resolutely wage the struggle against imperialism headed by the United States and against old and new colonialism until they are completely eliminated from the earth.
    Chawado said, "We will never compromise with any anti-people forces." "We will frankly and fearlessly continue to expose, by all means, those who have fallen into the mire of reactionary pragmatism and surrendered."
    Chawado's comprehensive report is divided into two parts: on the current international political situation; and on the activities of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association over the past year and more, and its future tasks.
    When discussing the current international situation, Chawado strongly condemned U.S. imperialism for its aggression against Vietnam and for pursuing its policies of aggression and war in Asia, Africa, and around the world. He also condemned those sham revolutionaries who have played a treacherous and sinister role in aiding and abetting the imperialist schemes of aggression.
    He said that today, the struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and the entire world against imperialism and old and new colonialism is reaching an unprecedented peak. Currently, in order to escape their own difficulties, the imperialists are carrying out the most rampant and arrogant aggression, and they are meeting with the strongest resistance from the people of the world, especially from the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the storm centers of the world.
    He said that the dividing line between aggressive and subversive forces and the people striving for liberation and peace has now become very clear. On one side stand U.S.-led imperialism, their lackeys, and those who have surrendered to them, and on the other side stand the powerful and resolute anti-imperialist forces who believe that there can be no compromise between themselves and imperialism, between the oppressors and the oppressed. At this moment in our history, the imperialists and their apologists have exposed their true faces, and people recognize who is the common enemy of all mankind. There is no doubt that the anti-imperialist forces are growing into a powerful fortress.
    He said that imperialist countries have always tried to prevent the national independence movements of the people and to obstruct the progress of the people who have just shaken off the chains of oppression. They may temporarily gain the upper hand here or there. However, these setbacks are only temporary because the people draw invaluable lessons from them, reorganize their forces, and just as day will surely come after night, because the power of the people is infinite. In short, the world situation is very favorable to the people of all countries. No force in the world, and no amount of weapons, money, or aggression can stop our inevitable victory.
    He said that the focus of American aggression has shifted from Europe to the center of the anti-imperialist struggle, the storm center of the world. Asia, Africa, and Latin America are the first to bear the brunt of imperialist aggression today. And it is in these places that the people's resistance is the most powerful, dealing heavy and fatal blows to imperialism and its lackeys. The situation for the anti-imperialist forces has never been so good, has never reached such an unprecedented peak.
    Chawado said that the heroic Vietnamese people have shown the world that the American aggressors are being defeated. Vietnam has proved to the world that what determines the future of a nation and brings it true independence and freedom is not weapons, but the courage, determination, and awareness of the people to wage a struggle against aggression and to defeat the reactionaries. The entire Vietnamese people have thrown themselves into the battle against aggression, fully demonstrating the power of people's war. The victory achieved by the Vietnamese people fully proves that people's war is the best way to deal with the aggression of U.S. imperialism. Now, the American aggressors are in a dead end, and therefore they are frantically adopting all kinds of cunning means in an attempt to obtain what they cannot obtain on the battlefield. The American aggressors are playing peace tricks around the world, attempting to deceive the Vietnamese people into laying down their arms. However, the heroic Vietnamese people, tempered in the anti-imperialist struggle, have exposed the deceptive nature of Johnson's peace talks. The four points of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point statement of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front express the strongest will of the Vietnamese people. All true revolutionaries can only take one line on the Vietnam issue, which is to unequivocally support the propositions and statements of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the South Vietnam National Liberation Front. The attempt by the apologists of imperialism to induce the Vietnamese people to accept the imperialist "peace" proposals has also completely failed. There is no doubt that the just struggle of the Vietnamese people will achieve final victory.
    Chawado then discussed the struggles of the people of Cambodia, Laos, Korea, China, Japan, and other Asian countries against U.S.-led imperialism and its lackeys.
    He said that the Cambodian people have set an example of uncompromising struggle against U.S. imperialism by rejecting all forms of U.S. aid and severing relations with the United States.
    He said that U.S. imperialism is putting pressure on the Kingdom of Cambodia and colluding with its lackeys in Bangkok and Saigon to intimidate the Kingdom of Cambodia, create conspiracies, and violate its borders; U.S. planes are constantly bombing the liberated areas controlled by the patriotic forces of Laos; and at the same time, Thai troops are attacking the Lao People's Armed Forces together with the Lao right-wing troops. It is very clear that U.S. imperialism's criminal activities against the Kingdom of Cambodia and Laos aim to expand the war of aggression to the entire Indochina and the People's Republic of China.
    He said that the Korean people are waging a struggle to drive U.S. imperialism out of South Korea, thwart the re-invasion of South Korea by Japanese militarism colluding with the United States, and achieve the reunification of their motherland.
    He said that the 650 million Chinese people have expressed their determination to strike a powerful blow against any U.S. imperialist aggression at any time. The People's Republic of China, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are rapidly developing their socialist construction on the basis of self-reliance and are standing at the forefront of the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
    He said that the Japanese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism's enslavement of the Japanese people and its use of Japan as a military base for wars of aggression is surging like an angry tide. The Japanese people are openly challenging the activities of the Japanese reactionaries who are reviving militarism in accordance with the aggressive policies of U.S. imperialism.
    Chawado condemned the fascist military dictatorship of Indonesian Generals Nasution and Suharto for brutally slaughtering hundreds of thousands of patriots and imprisoning hundreds of thousands more, while all basic democratic rights have been cancelled by the fascist military dictatorship. He said, but there, it has already been seen that the people's resistance is at work, and sooner or later this struggle will sweep across all of Indonesia and return this country to the anti-imperialist camp. The future for this struggle is bright, and it will inevitably achieve final victory.
    He said that the Pakistani people achieved victory in their struggle against the Indian aggressors supported by U.S. imperialism. The movement of the Kashmiri people for self-determination is being pushed to an unprecedented peak.
    When discussing the anti-imperialist struggle of the Arab people, Chawado said that the just struggle of the Palestinian people against U.S. imperialism and the Zionist tool and base of aggression, Israel, and demanding the return of Palestinian refugees to their illegally deprived homes, is developing in depth. Their struggle, together with the anti-imperialist torrent of the Asian and African people, is impacting this stronghold of U.S. imperialism in the Middle East.
    He said that the aggressive essence and imperialist origins of the imperialist-planned Islamic Treaty have been quickly exposed by the people of Asia and Africa. The people of Asia and Africa rejected this aggressive treaty, causing the imperialists to suffer another major setback and failure.
    Chawado said that the African people's struggle for self-determination and national independence has also achieved brilliant results. The African people are resolutely waging a struggle to prevent the imperialists and colonialists from returning to their homeland.
    The people of the Congo (Léopoldville), under the leadership of national liberation forces, like their South Vietnamese brothers, are delivering fatal blows to the puppet imposed on them by the American and Belgian imperialists. Our Congolese brothers have resolutely chosen the path of armed struggle, thus abandoning the ideas given to them by those fake revolutionaries, who had advised them not to take up arms, and who had previously persuaded them to bring in the United Nations controlled by the United States. In "Portuguese" Guinea, Mozambique, and Angola, the Portuguese colonialists have suffered one defeat after another at the hands of the national liberation movements in these places. These regions of Africa are quite certain of the correctness of armed struggle.
    Chawado said that the reactionaries in Ghana seem to have gained the upper hand, but this is only temporary. The Ghanaian people, tempered in the struggle against colonialism, will not sit idly by. After the reactionary imperialist military coup in Ghana, the African people have launched a new high tide of struggle against imperialist subversion, interference, aggression, and oppression. African countries and peoples all resolutely support the progressive forces of Ghana led by President Nkrumah. The American-engineered coup in Ghana shows that as long as imperialism exists, it will always be a threat to the security of independent African countries, and the people of African countries and imperialism are inevitably irreconcilable.
    He also discussed the anti-imperialist struggles of the people of Algeria, Azania (South Africa), Guinea, Mali, and other African countries.
    Chawado said that U.S. imperialism's brutal interference and "dictating" to the Latin American continent has aroused even stronger resistance from the Latin American people. U.S. imperialism's naked aggression against the Dominican Republic has made the Latin American people see the nature of U.S. imperialism clearly. The entire Latin American continent is extremely dissatisfied with U.S. imperialism, with the greedy control of their national economies by American monopoly capitalists, and with U.S. imperialism's continued brutal interference in the internal affairs of Latin American countries. The people of many Latin American countries have risen up to wage armed struggle.
    Chawado emphasized that this is the counterattack of the people of the countries at the center of the storm against the conspiracies, subversion, and aggression of U.S. imperialism and their lackeys. The anti-imperialist struggle of the people of all countries is rising to an unprecedented height, while U.S.-led imperialism is at the end of its rope. This is the mainstream in Asia, Africa, and Latin America today.
    Speaking of the need for the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to further consolidate and expand the anti-American united front, Chawado said that to consolidate and expand the anti-imperialist united front, we must expose and oppose the sham revolutionaries. Sham revolutionaries, who cooperate and collude with U.S. imperialism, have become the enemies of the Asian and African people. Wherever imperialism is in difficulty, the sham revolutionaries will provide assistance; wherever the people rise up to strike heavy blows against imperialism and its lackeys and apologists.
    Chawado also talked about the awakening of black people in the United States and the unprecedented mass movement of the American people against the invasion of Vietnam, the anti-American struggles of the people of Oceania and European countries, and the increasing contradictions within the imperialist camp.
    Chawado condemned the U.S.-led imperialist forces' attempts to isolate China. He said that the people of Asia and Africa have not been deceived. China is a brother of the people of Asia and Africa and a close friend. No matter how much slander and attempts to isolate China, they cannot separate the Chinese people from other peoples in the storm center.
    After analyzing the weaknesses of U.S.-led imperialism and its lackeys, Chawado said that from the continuous collapse of imperialism's lackeys in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, we can confidently judge the death and weakness of imperialism. These lackeys, like their masters, do not have the support of the people, and like their masters, they are bound to collapse, but unlike their masters, they will collapse before their masters, and the day when their masters collapse is not far away. The frequent coups in South Vietnam show that the end of U.S. imperialism is approaching. The likes of Ankrah, Nasution, and Suharto only show the weakness of imperialism. They will eventually collapse like Tshombe and Syngman Rhee. These acts of aggression by imperialism are just the last struggles of a dying tiger.
    Chawado emphasized that some people are intimidated by the superficial strength of imperialism. They are afraid of this tottering, clay-footed "giant" and compromise with him. They surrender and undermine the anti-imperialist struggle together with the reactionaries. They loudly proclaim that they are anti-imperialist, but invariably defend and make excuses for imperialism. They dream of colluding with imperialism to dominate the world. We want to ask, why has there been repeated attempts to establish an international United Nations "peacekeeping" force? Isn't this an arrogant conspiracy to suppress the national liberation movements and people's wars in Asia, Africa, and Latin America? They are intimidated by the superficial strength of imperialism and have no confidence in the strength of progressive forces. In order to save their own lives, they compromise with U.S. imperialism. Now, they are invariably colluding with imperialism on the main key issues related to the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Together with the imperialists, they support reactionaries in various countries. They pretend to be "close friends" of the Asian and African people, falsely playing the name of "unity" in order to sow discord and carry out divisive activities among the Asian and African people, thereby undermining the anti-imperialist unity of the Asian and African people. They split the national liberation movement. It is these "friends" who armed the Indian reactionaries, and when the Indian reactionaries attacked another socialist country, China, and invaded Pakistan, they did not condemn it. It is these "friends" who, while shouting loudly about self-determination, do not condemn India's suppression of the Kashmiri people's struggle for self-determination. They were scared out of their wits and even advised us not to wage a struggle against imperialism, "because this would cause a world war and cause the enemy to use nuclear weapons." It was because the African patriot Lumumba listened to the wrong advice of "friends" that these "friends" brought the American-controlled United Nations forces into the Congo, as a result of which U.S. imperialism cruelly murdered him and plundered the country's wealth. It is these "friends" who are supporting the reactionary groups within the national liberation movements of Asia, Africa, and Latin America that are about to die. ... Everywhere they cooperate with imperialism and reactionaries, helping imperialism try to extinguish the flames of the people's armed struggle. In this way, they have placed themselves outside the people's anti-imperialist front and in opposition to the people.
    Chawado said that these sham revolutionaries' surrender to imperialism has made it easy for U.S. imperialism to shift its military focus from Europe and concentrate its global military strategy on the storm center, especially Southeast Asia. By doing so, they gave imperialism a breathing opportunity, thereby betraying the revolutionary forces that were containing the enemy on various fronts. In this way, they allowed imperialism to survive.
    When discussing the struggles of imperialism and its lackeys, Chawado said that the history of mankind has proven that the mad counterattacks of moribund reactionary forces always foreshadow the greater victories that new forces are about to achieve. This will be a great victory that will eliminate all imperialism and the colonial system. He said that the turbulence of the situation marks the progress of history, and the great turbulence indicates the acceleration of the pulse of the times. Mankind is constantly moving forward along a line that separates the new forces from the decadent forces, and we firmly believe that the vast majority are against oppression and aggression and striving for liberation and peace. On the road forward, they may encounter difficulties and suffer setbacks in some places. But this can only help them learn from their failures, sharpen their knives faster, and strike heavier blows against the enemy.
    Chawado said that just when the people of Asia and Africa are engaged in a life-and-death struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism, some people are loudly shouting that imperialism is no longer dangerous, that only "a handful" of colonial remnants remain, and even that freedom bestowed by colonialism can be obtained by relying on resolutions passed by the United Nations manipulated by U.S. imperialism. They also say that peace is more important than freedom, and that the people of Asia and Africa do not need to wage an anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle, but should concentrate on developing their economies. These people are not only dreaming, but in fact, spreading these arguments is aimed at extinguishing the flames of the anti-imperialist struggle of the Asian and African people. It is necessary for the Asian and African people to directly and thoroughly expose such hypocrites.
    He said that in the countries at the center of the storm, how can they develop their own economies by separating themselves from the central task of anti-imperialist struggle when American and other imperialist monopoly capital groups control their economic lifelines and thereby control their domestic and foreign policies? He said that the imperialists and colonialists and their local agents are trying to subvert emerging countries in order to return to Asia and Africa to restore the colonial system. After listing the facts of U.S.-led imperialism's aggression everywhere in Asia and Africa, he said, Can these facts prove that colonialism has been eliminated? He said that in the face of the powerful storm of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and old and new colonialism, imperialism is trying to save its inevitable fate of death. The emergence of a group of apologists is only to meet the needs of imperialism, attempting to sabotage from within the national independence movement. However, although imperialism or its lackeys create countercurrents, they cannot stop the torrent of the river.
    He said that the struggles being waged in various places in the center of the storm show that imperialism and us, the oppressors and the oppressed, cannot coexist peacefully. Reactionary forces and progressive forces cannot compromise. Revolution and counter-revolution cannot cooperate. How can the oppressors and the oppressed, imperialism and us, coexist and cooperate? Those who advocate this policy of the grave, that imperialism and we can coexist peacefully, are actually helping imperialism, thereby weakening the anti-imperialist struggle. When they want to coexist with their enemies, that is, the reactionary forces, they not only kill themselves, but also impose this suicidal policy on us, on the national liberation movement. We must resolutely oppose this.
    He said that the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have clearly put forward their correct estimate of the current objective world forces. They have once again dealt a heavy blow to the imperialists and their apologists. History has once again shown that the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are moving forward. History has once again disappointed the imperialists and their apologists, and will continue to disappoint them, they are not and will never learn from history.
    Chawado said that when the people's struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism has reached this historical and unprecedented peak, what role should we, the members and standard bearers of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association who fight with pens, play? Progressive and militant Afro-Asian journalists firmly believe that journalism cannot be separated from the objective political environment in which Afro-Asian journalists are located. In the past year or so, it can be concluded from the obvious high revolutionism of journalism and the greater participation of Afro-Asian journalists in the daily struggle of the Afro-Asian people that Afro-Asian journalists have political awareness and fully support the anti-imperialist struggle.
    Chawado strongly condemned the various persecutions of Afro-Asian journalists by imperialism and its lackeys. He said that in many cases, our progressive and militant colleagues are the objects of persecution by imperialists and their lackeys. Many people have given their lives. Many people stand at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism and for national liberation.
    In Indonesia, hundreds of progressive journalists who have always stood at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism and against old and new colonialism are currently suffering in prison. Many have been massacred, and many have been subjected to the most brutal torture and humiliation. All of their progressive newspapers have been banned.
    In Ghana, as seen in Indonesia, the first target of the leaders of the right-wing military coup supported by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was progressive journalists. Various progressive newspapers were closed down. Many of our colleagues were arrested and imprisoned.
    We would also like to point out here the persecution suffered by those journalists in Aden who are fighting against British colonialism and for national independence, as well as the persecution suffered by democratic journalists in South Korea, South Vietnam, Morocco, Peru, and many other countries.
    We strongly condemn the persecution of these journalists—our brothers—and express our firm support and solidarity with them.
    In Indonesia, the military fascist dictatorship, fearing the truth spread by Xinhua News Agency, closed the Jakarta branch of Xinhua News Agency.
    This fear of our press by imperialists and their lackeys is a sign of the corrupt nature of reactionary forces. It is a sign of our strength; it is a sign that imperialists and their lackeys are afraid of the truth we spread.
    Chawado said that the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association, as a firm, dedicated, and anti-imperialist international organization of journalists, is determined to wage the struggle against U.S.-led imperialism and old and new colonialism. We are part of the current world anti-imperialist struggle that is sweeping across the three continents and developing to other regions. The Afro-Asian Journalists' Association will work tirelessly with the fighting people of the world until imperialism, old and new colonialism, and all their forms and manifestations are completely eliminated from the earth. We reiterate that we will frankly and fearlessly continue to expose, by all means, those who have fallen into the mire of reactionary pragmatism and surrendered. We will wage a direct, powerful, and open and aboveboard struggle against imperialism in all areas under imperialist rule.
    In the second part of his report, Chawado introduced the responsibilities and work carried out by the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association as an anti-imperialist and progressive organization of journalists. The Afro-Asian Journalists' Association has maintained its characteristics as a progressive and militant organization and has made the greatest contribution to the struggle against U.S.-led imperialism. Wherever national liberation struggles unfold, we fight and propagate for this cause. In the hands of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association, the powerful weapon of the pen has become even more powerful. This weapon has been used in the widest and fullest way to promote the unity of various fighting forces in the world and to unite them. We unite and encourage revolutionary journalists to stand at the forefront of their liberation movements. These achievements prove that the influence of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association not only extends to all parts of Asia and Africa, but even to other continents.
    Regarding the future work of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association, Chawado said that the anti-American storm around the world is at its height, and the people of Asia and Africa must strengthen their unity and resolutely wage their struggle against U.S. imperialism. As a progressive and militant anti-imperialist and anti-colonial organization, the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association has a full responsibility to stand firmly with the people of Asia and Africa, thoroughly expose the crimes committed by U.S. imperialism, support the just struggles of the people of all countries around the world, and contribute to strengthening the unity of the people of the world, especially the people of Asia and Africa, in the anti-imperialist struggle.

### 美帝及其走狗制造逆流阻止不了亚非拉反帝斗争主流  亚非记协坚决同全世界人民一起战斗到消灭帝国主义

    查禾多总书记在亚非记协书记处会议（扩大）上作总报告
    美帝及其走狗制造逆流阻止不了亚非拉反帝斗争主流  亚非记协坚决同全世界人民一起战斗到消灭帝国主义
    要巩固和扩大反帝统一战线必须揭露和反对同美帝勾结的假革命者
    新华社二十一日讯　亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多，二十一日在亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议（扩大）上作总报告时宣称，在当前世界反帝大好形势下，亚非新闻工作者协会将更高地举起反帝战斗的旗帜，同亚非人民和全世界人民一起，坚决进行反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争，直到它们从地球上彻底消灭。
    查禾多说，“我们决不与任何反人民的势力妥协”。“我们将坦率地、毫不畏惧地用一切方法，继续揭露那些滚进反动的实用主义泥坑和投降的人。”
    查禾多的总报告共分两部分：关于目前的国际政治形势；关于亚非新闻工作者协会一年多来的活动和今后的工作任务。
    查禾多在谈到目前国际形势时，强烈谴责美帝国主义侵略越南，并在亚非和世界各地推行侵略政策和战争政策。他还谴责那些假革命者在帮助和鼓励帝国主义的侵略阴谋中扮演了叛逆的阴险角色。
    他说，今天，亚洲、非洲以及全世界的人民反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义的斗争，正在走向前所未有的高峰。目前，帝国主义为了摆脱它们本身的困难，正在进行最猖獗、最狂妄的侵略，他们遭到全世界人民，特别是世界风暴中心——亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的最强大的反抗。
    他说，区分侵略与颠覆势力和争取解放与和平的人民之间的分界线，现在变得十分清晰。一边站的是以美国为首的帝国主义、它们的走狗和向它们投降的人，另一边站的是强大的坚决反帝的力量，他们认为他们与帝国主义之间、压迫者与被压迫者之间是不能妥协的。在我们历史的这一时刻，帝国主义和他们的辩护士暴露了他们的真正面目，人们认清了谁是全人类的共同敌人。毫无疑问，反帝力量正在壮大成为强大的堡垒。
    他说，帝国主义国家始终尽力阻止人民的民族独立运动和阻挠刚摆脱压迫的锁链的人民前进。它们会在这儿或那儿暂时占上风。但是，这些挫折只不过是暂时的，因为人民的力量从中吸取十分可贵的教训，重新组织自己的力量，并且正象黑夜过去了白天一定会到来一样，因为人民的力量是无穷的。总之，世界的形势对世界各国人民来说是大好的。世界上任何力量、也不管多少的武器、金钱或侵略都绝不能阻挡我们必然的胜利。
    他说，美国的侵略重点已从欧洲转移到世界反帝斗争风暴的中心。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲是今天首当帝国主义侵略之冲的地方。而正是在这些地方，各国人民的反抗最为有力，沉重地致命打击帝国主义及其走狗。反帝力量的形势从来没有这样良好，从来没有达到这样空前的高峰。
    查禾多说，英雄的越南人民向全世界昭示美国侵略者正在打败仗。越南已经向全世界证明了：决定一个民族的前途、能为自己带来真正的独立自由的不是武器，而是人民敢于进行反侵略斗争和敢于打败反动派的勇气、决心和觉悟。越南全体人民都投入了反侵略的战斗，从而充分显示了人民战争的威力。越南人民取得的胜利完全证明，人民战争是对付美帝国主义侵略的最好办法。现在，美国侵略者处于走投无路的境地，因此疯狂地采取各种狡猾的手段，企图取得它们在战场上不能得到的东西。美国侵略者在全世界玩弄和平骗局，图谋欺骗越南人民，使他们放下武器。但是从反帝斗争中锻炼出来的英雄的越南人民，揭露了约翰逊和谈骗局的欺骗实质。越南民主共和国的四点主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明表达了越南人民最坚强的意志。凡是真正的革命者，在越南问题上只能采取一种路线，那就是毫不含糊地支持越南民主共和国和越南南方民族解放阵线的主张和声明。帝国主义的辩护士想诱使越南人民接受帝国主义的“和平”建议，这种企图也彻底破产了。毫无疑问，越南人民的正义斗争将取得最后胜利。
    查禾多接着对柬埔寨、老挝、朝鲜、中国、日本以及亚洲其他各国人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，进行了论述。
    他说，柬埔寨人民拒绝了各种形式的美援和断绝了与美国的关系，从而树立了一个与美帝国主义进行毫不妥协斗争的榜样。
    他说，美帝国主义对柬埔寨王国施加压力，并且伙同它们在曼谷和西贡的走狗对柬埔寨王国进行恐吓，制造阴谋和侵犯边境；美国飞机不断对由老挝爱国力量控制的解放区进行轰炸；同时泰国军队同老挝右派军队一道进攻老挝人民武装力量。十分清楚，美帝国主义对柬埔寨王国和老挝进行罪恶活动，其目的是要把侵略战争扩大到整个印度支那和中华人民共和国。
    他说，朝鲜人民正在进行把美帝国主义赶出南朝鲜，挫败同美国勾结的日本军国主义重新入侵南朝鲜，并且实现祖国统一的斗争。
    他说，六亿五千万中国人民已表示了他们随时准备对美帝国主义的进犯予以有力打击的决心。中华人民共和国、越南民主共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，正以自力更生为基础迅速发展着它们的社会主义的建设，并站在亚、非、拉美人民反帝斗争的最前列。
    他说，日本人民反对美帝国主义奴役日本人民和利用日本作为侵略战争的军事基地的斗争，好象怒潮一样汹涌澎湃。日本人民正向日本反动派按着美帝国主义的侵略政策复活军国主义的活动公开挑战。
      查禾多谴责印度尼西亚纳苏蒂安和苏哈托将军的法西斯军事独裁集团残暴地屠杀了几十万爱国者，还把几十万爱国者关进了监狱，一切基本民主权利为法西斯军事独裁集团所取消。他说，但是在那里，人们已经看到，人民的反抗斗争在活动，这个斗争迟早要席卷整个印度尼西亚，使这个国家再次回到反对帝国主义的阵线中来。这个斗争的前途是光明的，而且一定会取得最后胜利。
    他说，巴基斯坦人民在反对由美帝国主义支持的印度侵略者的斗争中，取得了胜利。克什米尔人民争取自决的运动正推向空前未有的高峰。
    查禾多在谈到阿拉伯各国人民的反帝斗争时说，巴勒斯坦人民反对美帝国主义和犹太复国主义的工具及侵略基地——以色列，要求巴勒斯坦难民重返被非法剥夺的家园的正义斗争，日益深入发展。他们的斗争，和亚非人民的反帝洪流汇合在一起，冲击着美帝国主义在中东地区的这个堡垒。
    他说，帝国主义策划的伊斯兰条约的侵略本质和帝国主义根源，被亚非两大洲人民迅速揭露了出来。亚非人民拒绝了这个侵略性的条约，使帝国主义者遭到了又一次重大挫折和失败。
    查禾多说，非洲人民争取自决和民族独立的斗争也取得了辉煌的成绩。非洲人民正在坚决进行斗争。阻止帝国主义者和殖民主义者重新回到他们的国土上来。
    刚果（利）人民在民族解放力量的领导下，正象南越兄弟一样，在致命打击美国和比利时帝国主义者强加在他们头上的傀儡。我们的刚果弟兄坚决地选择了武装斗争的道路，这样，他们就抛弃了那些假革命者给他们出的主意，那些人曾劝他们不要拿起武器，在以前并曾说服了他们把美国控制的联合国请进来。在“葡属”几内亚，莫三鼻给和安哥拉，葡萄牙殖民主义者在这些地方民族解放运动的手里遭到一次又一次的失败。非洲这些地区都很确切地说明了武装斗争的正确性。
    查禾多说，加纳的反动派看起来好象占了上风，但是这只是暂时的。在反对殖民主义的斗争中得到锻炼的加纳人民，是不会消极观望的。在加纳发生反动的帝国主义军事政变之后，非洲人民已经掀起了一个反对帝国主义颠覆、干涉、侵略和压迫的斗争的新高潮。非洲国家和人民全都坚决支持恩克鲁玛总统领导的加纳进步力量。美国策动的加纳政变说明了，只要帝国主义存在，它始终是对独立的非洲国家安全的威胁，非洲各国人民和帝国主义必然是不可调和的。
    他还谈到了阿尔及利亚、阿扎尼亚（南非）、几内亚和马里以及其他非洲各国人民的反帝斗争。
    查禾多说，美帝国主义的粗暴干涉和对拉丁美洲大陆的“发号施令”，激起了拉丁美洲人民更加强烈的反抗。美帝国主义对多米尼加赤裸裸的侵略，使拉丁美洲人民清楚看出了美帝国主义的本性。整个拉丁美洲大陆对美帝国主义，对美国垄断资本家对它们的民族经济贪婪的控制，对美帝国主义继续粗暴地干涉拉丁美洲各国内政都极度不满，很多拉丁美洲国家的人民起来进行武装斗争。
    查禾多强调说，这就是风暴中心的各国人民对美帝国主义和他们的走狗的阴谋、颠覆和侵略的反击。各国人民的反帝斗争空前高涨，而以美国为首的帝国主义正处于穷途末路。这就是今天亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的主流。
    谈到亚、非、拉人民必须进一步巩固和扩大反美统一战线的时候，查禾多说，要巩固和扩大反帝统一战线，我们就必须揭露和反对假革命者。假革命者同美帝国主义合作和勾结，已经成为亚非人民的敌人。哪里帝国主义处于困境，假革命者就给予援助；哪里的人民就起来给予帝国主义和它的走狗与辩护人以沉重的打击。
    查禾多还谈到美国黑人的觉醒和美国人民空前规模的反对侵略越南的群众运动，大洋洲和欧洲各国人民的反美斗争，以及帝国主义阵营日益扩大的矛盾。
    查禾多谴责以美国为首的帝国主义势力企图孤立中国。他说，亚非人民没有受骗。中国是亚非人民的兄弟，是亲密的朋友，不管有多大的污蔑，以及孤立中国的企图，都不能把中国人民同风暴中心的其他人民分割开来。
    查禾多分析了以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗的虚弱性以后说，从帝国主义在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的走狗不断的垮台，我们可以很有把握地判断帝国主义的死亡和虚弱。这些走狗和他们的主子一样得不到人民的支持，和他们的主子一样必定要垮台，但是他们与他们的主子不同的是，他们要比主子先垮台，而他们主子垮台的日子也不远了。南越频繁的政变说明美帝国主义的末日临近了。安克拉、纳苏蒂安和苏哈托之流只是显示帝国主义的虚弱，他们象冲伯、李承晚一样终将垮台的。帝国主义的这些侵略行为只是象垂死的老虎作最后的挣扎。
    查禾多强调说，可是有些人却被帝国主义的表面力量吓倒了。他们害怕这个摇摇欲坠的泥足“巨人”，去同他妥协。他们去投降，同反动派一起破坏了反帝斗争。他们大声宣扬他们是反帝的，但却千篇一律地为帝国主义进行辩护和编造借口，他们梦想与帝国主义勾结共同主宰世界。我们要问，为什么一再企图成立一支联合国“维持和平”的国际部队呢？难道这不是要镇压亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族解放运动和人民战争的狂妄阴谋吗？他们被帝国主义的表面力量所吓倒，对进步势力的力量没有信心。为了保全自己的生命，就同美帝国主义妥协。现在，他们在有关亚、非、拉三洲人民的主要的关键问题上一成不变地与帝国主义勾结。他们与帝国主义者一起，支持各国反动派。他们假装成亚非人民“亲密的朋友”，虚假地玩弄着“团结”的名词，以便在亚非人民中间散布不和与进行分裂活动，从而破坏亚非人民反帝的团结。他们分裂民族解放运动。就是这些“朋友”，他们武装了印度反动派，当印度反动派进攻另一个社会主义国家中国和侵略巴基斯坦的时候，他们不加谴责。就是这些“朋友”，一边对自决叫得应天响，一边却不谴责印度镇压克什米尔人民争取自决的斗争。他们吓破了胆，甚至劝我们不要进行反对帝国主义的斗争，“因为这会引起一场世界大战，会使敌人使用核力量”。就是由于非洲的爱国者卢蒙巴听了“朋友”的错误劝告，因此这些“朋友”把美国控制的联合国部队引进了刚果，结果美帝国主义残酷地杀害了他，并且掠夺这个国家的财富。就是这些“朋友”，正在支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族解放运动内部将要死亡的反动的集团。……他们到处和帝国主义与反动派合作，帮助帝国主义企图扑灭人民武装斗争的火焰。这样他们就置身于人民反帝阵线之外，处于和人民对立的地位。
    查禾多说，这些假革命者向帝国主义的投降，使得美帝国主义能够很容易地把它的军事重点从欧洲转移，并将它的全球军事战略集中到风暴中心，特别是东南亚。他们这样做就使帝国主义得到一个喘息的机会，从而背叛了在各个战线上牵制敌人的革命力量。这样他们就使帝国主义得以苟延残喘。
    在谈到帝国主义及其走狗的挣扎时，查禾多说，人类的历史已经证明，垂死的反动势力的疯狂反扑，总是预示着新生力量即将取得更大的胜利。这将是消灭一切帝国主义和殖民制度的伟大胜利。他说，局势的动荡标志着历史前进的步伐，而大动荡则表明时代脉搏的加速。人类正在沿着一条把新生力量和腐朽力量分开的界线不断前进，我们绝对相信，绝大多数是反对压迫与侵略、争取解放与和平的。在前进的道路上，他们可能会在某些地方遇到困难，遭受挫折。但这只能帮助他们从失败中吸取教训，把刀磨得更快，以对敌人作更沉重的打击。
    查禾多说，正当亚非人民对帝国主义与新老殖民主义进行生死斗争的时候，却有人大声叫嚷说，帝国主义不再危险了，只剩下“几小撮”殖民主义残余了，甚至说，依靠美帝国主义操纵下的联合国通过的决议，就可以得到殖民主义恩赐的自由。他们还说什么和平比自由更重要，亚非人民不需要进行反帝反殖的斗争。而应该集中力量发展经济。这些人不仅是在说梦话，而且在实际上散播这些论调是要达到扑灭亚非人民反帝斗争烈火的目的。对这种伪君子，亚非人民有必要进行直接的、彻底的揭露。
    他说，在风暴中心的国家，当美国及其他帝国主义垄断资本集团控制着它们的经济命脉并借此控制它们的内外政策的时候，它们怎么能脱离反帝斗争的中心任务而发展自己的经济呢？他说，帝国主义者和殖民主义者以及他们培养的当地代理人正在力图颠覆新兴国家，以重新返回亚洲和非洲来恢复殖民制度。他列举以美国为首的帝国主义在亚洲和非洲到处侵略的事实后说，这些事实难道能够证明殖民主义消灭了吗？他说，在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的强大风暴面前，帝国主义力图挽救他们不可避免的死亡的命运。一批辩护士的出现只是为了适应帝国主义的需要，企图从民族独立运动内部进行破坏。但是，尽管帝国主义或它的走狗制造逆流，他们都阻止不了大河的洪流。
    他说，在风暴中心各地进行的斗争表明，帝国主义同我们，压迫者同被压迫者不能和平共处。反动力量和进步力量不能妥协。革命和反革命不能合作。压迫者与被压迫者，帝国主义与我们怎么能共处和合作呢？那些鼓吹帝国主义与我们可以和平共处的这种坟墓政策的人实际上是在帮帝国主义的忙，从而削弱反帝斗争。当他们要和他们的敌人、也就是反动势力共处的时候，他们不仅杀死他们自己，而且把这种自杀性的政策强加于我们，强加于民族解放运动。对此我们必须坚决反对。
    他说，亚非拉三洲人民已明确地提出了他们对当前客观世界力量的正确估计。他们又一次给帝国主义者及其辩护士以沉重的打击。历史又一次表明，亚非拉三洲人民在前进。历史又一次使帝国主义者及其辩护士失望，而且将来会连续地使他们失望，他们是不可能而且决不会吸取历史教训的。
    查禾多说，在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的人民斗争达到目前这个历史性的、空前的高峰时，我们这些用笔杆进行斗争的亚非记协的成员和旗手该起什么作用呢？进步的战斗的亚非新闻工作者坚决认为，新闻工作不能脱离亚非新闻工作者所处的客观政治环境。在过去一年左右的时间里，从新闻工作明显的高度革命性以及亚非新闻工作者更多地参加亚非人民日常斗争中，可以断定亚非新闻工作者的政治觉悟和他们完全支持反帝斗争。
    查禾多强烈谴责帝国主义及其走狗对亚非新闻工作者的种种迫害。他说，在许多情况下，我们的进步的和战斗的同行是帝国主义者及其走狗迫害的对象。许多人献出了自己的生命。许多人站在反对帝国主义、争取民族解放的斗争的最前列。
    在印度尼西亚，一直站在反对帝国主义、反对新老殖民主义斗争最前列的数以百计的进步新闻工作者目前正在狱中受罪。许多人遭到残杀，许多人受到最残酷的拷打和侮辱。他们的进步报纸全被查禁了。
    在加纳，就象在印度尼西亚所看到的一样，美国中央情报局扶植的右派军事政变领导人的第一个目标就是进步的新闻工作者。各种进步报纸被封闭。我们的许多同行被逮捕和监禁。
    我们在这里也要指出亚丁的那些为反对英国殖民主义者、争取民族独立而战斗的新闻工作者遭受的迫害以及南朝鲜、南越、摩洛哥、秘鲁和许多其它国家的民主的新闻工作者所遭受的迫害。
    我们强烈谴责对这些新闻工作者——我们的兄弟——进行的迫害，并对他们表示我们坚定地支持和声援。
    在印度尼西亚，军事法西斯独裁政权害怕新华社传播的真理，关闭了雅加达的新华社分社。
    帝国主义者及其走狗对我们的新闻事业的这种恐惧是表明反动力量的腐朽性的一个迹象。它是表明我们的力量的一个迹象；它是表明帝国主义者及其走狗害怕我们所传播的真理的一个迹象。
    查禾多说，亚非记协作为一个坚定的、专心致志的、反帝的国际新闻工作者组织，坚决进行反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争。我们是当前席卷三大洲和发展到其他地区的世界反帝斗争的一部分。亚非记协将与全世界战斗的人民一道不屈不挠地工作，直到帝国主义、新老殖民主义以及它们的一切形式和表现从地球上彻底消灭。我们重申，我们将坦率地、毫不畏惧地用一切方法继续揭露那些滚进反动的实用主义泥坑和投降的人。我们将在帝国主义统治的一切地区与帝国主义进行正面的、有力的、正大光明的斗争。
    查禾多在他报告的第二部分中介绍了亚非记协作为一个反帝和进步的新闻工作者组织所担负的责任和所进行的工作。亚非记协保持了它作为一个进步和战斗的组织的特性，对同以美国为首的帝国主义进行的斗争作出了最大的贡献。哪里展开了民族解放斗争，我们就为这个事业进行斗争和进行宣传。在亚非记协手里，笔杆子这种强有力的武器变得更加有力量了。这个武器得到了最广泛和最充分的利用，以促进世界上各种战斗力量的团结并把它们联合起来。我们团结并鼓励了革命的新闻工作者站在他们的解放运动的最前列。这些成就证明，亚非记协的影响不仅遍及亚非的各个地方，甚至遍及其它大陆。
    关于亚非记协今后的工作，查禾多说，全世界的反美风暴正处于高潮，亚非人民必须加强他们的团结，并坚决进行他们的反对美帝国主义的斗争。亚非记协作为一个进步和战斗性的反帝和反殖民主义组织，完全有责任坚定地同亚非各国人民站在一起，彻底揭露美帝国主义所犯的罪行，支持全世界各国人民的正义斗争，并对加强全世界人民、特别是亚非各国人民在反帝斗争中的团结作出贡献。
