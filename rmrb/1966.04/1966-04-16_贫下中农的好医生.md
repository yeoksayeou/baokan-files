    A Good Doctor for Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants
    Shi Qingyun, Hebei Zhuoxian Health Work Team
    Zhang Hongyi is a semi-farming, semi-medical doctor from the Shawowo Brigade of the Xiangyang Commune in Zhuoxian, Hebei. He graduated from junior high school last year and participated in labor. In the fall, the commune established a semi-farming, semi-medical training class, and the Party branch selected him to study. Although it has only been four months, he is already a well-known doctor in the village.
    "Can a young man who has only studied for a few months prescribe medicine and treat illnesses?" That's what many people said at first. Facts are most convincing. Last October, when he had just started studying, he was returning home one day. As he was about to enter the village, he saw a man being pushed out of the orchard in a small cart. Uncle Wei Wen was lying diagonally on the cart, as his back pain had flared up again. When he got home, the patient was groaning in pain, and his forehead was covered in a cold sweat. Zhang Hongyi thought: If I give him acupuncture, maybe it can stop the pain. The teacher taught acupoints for treating back pain a few days ago, but what if I damage something? For a few short minutes, the thoughts of "acupuncture" and "no acupuncture" went back and forth in his mind several times. He finally decided: I study medicine to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants, how can I back down when it's time to use it? So, he boldly said, "Let me give Uncle an acupuncture treatment!" The patient was in too much pain to answer, but the patient's mother, who was standing by, said, "You've only been studying for a couple of days, can you do it?" But seeing her son in so much pain, she felt really bad, and then added, "Try it!" At this time, Zhang Hongyi took out the needles, selected the acupoints, disinfected them, one needle, two needles... He inserted seven needles in a row. After an hour, he removed the needles, and the patient said, "It's much better." The next morning, Hongyi went to see him and saw Wei Wen propping himself up with a stick in the courtyard. He quickly helped him onto the bed and inserted five more needles. When Hongyi went to see him again that evening, Wei Wen said, "Thank you for your trouble, you don't have to worry about me anymore. I'm going to work tomorrow."
    This matter spread quickly throughout the village. "Zhang Hongyi in our village can treat illnesses now." "His acupuncture is quite good, now we don't have to go to other villages to ask for a doctor." From then on, more and more people came to him for treatment. As long as Hongyi heard someone calling him outside the window, he would put down his chopsticks, if he was eating, and run out. If it was dark, regardless of wind or snow, he would jump up, put on his clothes, and leave. Once, both of Wei Shan's children were sick, and they needed penicillin injections every four hours. He set the alarm clock at home and still wasn't at ease, so he told his mother to listen for the alarm. As soon as the alarm rang, he got up and went out. In this way, for several nights in a row, the two children finally recovered.
    Wei Zhenyuan's second daughter fell ill. Hongyi ran over, and the child was already in a coma. Hongyi listened and examined her. He injected medicine and, not feeling at ease, ran to the commune to invite his teacher. The teacher's diagnosis agreed with his treatment. Six hours later, the child woke up from the coma, and the whole family was overjoyed. But waking up didn't mean she was out of danger, and they couldn't be careless. Zhang Hongyi simply moved his quilt and slept next to the little patient. Although he said he was sleeping, in fact, he didn't close his eyes for two days and two nights! He held a book, read for a while, looked at the patient, and then looked at the watch. When it was time for the injection, he gave the child the injection. During the day, when it was time to eat, he left silently, went home to eat, and then came back silently. Once, Zhenyuan's mother insisted on keeping him for dinner, but he refused, saying, "If I eat your food, what kind of new doctor am I? The Party would have trained me for nothing."
    Hongyi's parents had lived through hardship. They fled famine to this village. His father worked for the landlord from the age of seventeen until liberation, when he was given a house and land. His father often said to Hongyi, "When I was your age, what work didn't I do? Carrying big buckets, hoeing the fields, grinding the mill, and I couldn't even get a full meal a day. If the Communist Party hadn't come, would you even be able to go to school? You must work hard for the poor, and you can't be lazy at all!" Hongyi went to see patients every night, and his mother waited at the door. Hongyi read books, and his mother often kept him company.
    Speaking of Hongyi's hard work in studying, the teachers praised him, the classmates praised him, and his parents and sisters praised him too. In class, Zhang Hongyi stared at the teacher intently, as if every word the teacher uttered was a seed being planted in his mind. In order to practice injections well, he stabbed his own arm over and over again. He said that he couldn't develop real skills without doing this. In order to learn acupuncture, he bought several acupuncture charts and pasted them on the wall. He would stand there holding a bowl while eating, staring at them. On the road, Hongyi always walked and recited at the same time.
    When it comes to labor, the commune members praise his labor as much as they praise his medical treatment. When he works, in the words of the villagers, he works stupidly and earnestly. The words "dirty" and "tired" are nowhere near him, and he is never willing to fall behind others in anything. Every day after studying, he doesn't go home, but goes directly to the orchard. The orchard is right next to the village, and many saplings haven't grown yet, with a lot of crops interplanted. When he gets there, he does whatever the captain tells him to do. This time during tree planting, the commune members get up at five o'clock and so does he, planting trees with the commune members, and then goes to school when it's time.
    I once asked Hongyi, "You study so hard, staying up with patients for two days and two nights and still reading, where do you get so much energy!" His answer was very simple: "It is Chairman Mao's books that gave me inexhaustible energy." As he spoke, he handed me a small notebook from the table, with the words "Study Notes on Chairman's Writings" written on it. As I opened it, word by word, line by line, watching, reading, it was as if I heard the beating of this poor peasant son's heart. He wrote: "I am a child from a poor family. My parents and the vast number of poor people suffered bitterly in the old society. This time the Party is training me to be a doctor. If I don't study hard and work hard, I will be letting down the Party and Chairman Mao, and letting down the poor and lower-middle peasants...."
    Hongyi's resounding voice has been echoing in my heart. In our countryside, how many Zhang Hongyis are growing up!

    贫下中农的好医生
    河北涿县卫生工作队　史庆云
    张宏义是河北涿县向阳公社沙窝大队的半农半医的医生。他去年初中毕业后参加了劳动，秋后，公社成立了半农半医训练班，支部选送他去学习，虽然刚刚四个月的时间，已经是村里有名的医生了。
    “刚学了几个月的小青年，也能给人开方治病么？”一开始，好些人都是这么说的。事实最能让人信服。去年十月，那时，他刚学习不久，有一天回家，刚要进村，只见从果园里用小车推出一个人来，魏文大叔斜躺在小车上，原来他腰疼病又犯了，到了家，病人疼得一个劲儿哼哼，脑门上已出了一层冷汗。张宏义想：我给他扎扎也许能止住疼，前几天老师才讲过治腰疼的穴位，可是我要扎坏了怎么办呢？短暂的几分钟，“扎”和“不扎”这两个念头在他脑子里来回倒了好几次。他到底决定了：我学医就是为贫下中农服务的，该用的时候怎能往后退？于是，他大胆地说：“我给大叔扎扎吧！”病人疼得没顾得回答，守在旁边的病人的妈妈说话了：“你刚学这么两天，扎得了吗？”可是一看儿子疼得那样，心里也着实难过，又接着说道：“你试试吧！”这时张宏义拿出针，选好穴位，消了毒，一针，两针……连扎了七针，一个多钟头把针起了，病人说：“轻多了。”第二天早上，宏义去时，见魏文正拄个棍子在院里呆着，忙把他扶到炕上又扎了五针。晚上宏义再去看他，魏文说：“多谢你费心，以后你就别惦记着了，明天我就干活去。”
    这件事一传十，十传百，很快在村里传开了。“咱村的张宏义能治病了。”“扎针扎得还挺好呢，这下看病再不用上外村请医生了。”从那以后，找看病的越来越多。宏义只要听谁在窗户外头喊他，他如果正吃饭，撂下筷子，就跑了出去。要是在黑夜，不管刮风下雪，也会腾一下子起来，穿好衣服就走。有一次，魏山家的两个小孩都病了，四个小时注射一次青霉素，他在家里定好了闹钟，还不放心，又嘱咐他妈听着钟响。闹钟一响，他起来就往外走，就这样连着好几宵，两个小孩终于恢复了健康。
    魏振元的二闺女病了，宏义跑了去，小孩已经昏迷，宏义一边听着，一边检查，他给注射了药，不放心，跑到公社把老师请来，老师诊断同意他的处理方法。六个小时以后，小孩从昏迷中醒过来，全家人都欢喜的了不得。醒过来并没有脱离危险期，一点也不能麻痹大意，张宏义索性把被子搬了来，睡在小病人旁边，说是睡，其实，他两天两夜没合眼哪！他拿着书，瞧一段书，看看病人，再看看表，到了该打针的时候，给小孩打了针。白天该吃饭时，不声不响走了，回家吃完饭，又不声不响来了。有一回振元的母亲死扯硬扯要留他吃饭，说什么他也不答应，他说：“我要吃您的饭还算什么新医生，党就白培养我了。”
    宏义的爸爸妈妈是在苦水里度过来的。逃荒到了这村。他爸爸从十七岁给地主扛活，直到解放，分了房子分了地。爸爸常对宏义说：“我象你这么大什么活儿不干？挑大桶、耪地推磨，一天也闹不上一顿饱饭，共产党要不来，你还想念书？你可得好好为穷人办事，一点不能懒哪！”宏义每天晚上去看病，妈妈都等门，宏义看书，妈妈也常陪着。
    提起宏义的刻苦学习劲，老师夸，同学夸，爸爸妈妈妹妹也没有不夸的。上课时候，张宏义目不转睛地盯着老师，好象老师吐出来的每一个字都撒种似的埋在他的脑海里。为了练好打针，他一下挨一下往自己胳膊上扎，他说，非这样不能练出真本事来。为了学针灸，他买了几张针灸挂图贴在墙上，一吃饭他就端着碗站在那儿，瞅着。在路上，宏义总是一边走，一边背。
    说到劳动，社员就象夸他治病一样，夸他劳动好。他干活，按老乡的话说，傻和和的傻干，什么脏啊累啊，这两个字眼跟他不沾边，干什么也不肯落在旁人后头。他每天学习回来，不进家门，直接上果园去。果园就在村边，树苗有的还没长起来，间种了好多庄稼，他到了那里，队长叫干什么活就干什么活。这次植树，社员五点钟起他也五点钟起，跟社员一块栽树，到了时间再上学。
    我曾问过宏义：“你学习这么用功，守着病人两天两夜不合眼还要看书，你那儿来的这么大精力啊！”他回答的很简单：“是毛主席的书，给了我用不完的劲头。”说着，他从桌子上递给我一个小本本，上面写着“主席著作学习笔记”八个字，我翻开来，一字字，一行行，看着，读着，好象我听见了这个贫农儿子的心的跳动。他写道：“我是个穷人家的孩子，我的爸爸妈妈和广大穷人在旧社会受尽了苦，这次党培养我当医生，我要是不好好学，好好干，就对不起党和毛主席，对不起贫下中农。……”
    宏义的铿锵的心声，一直在我心里回响着，在我们的农村里，有多少个张宏义正在成长起来啊！
