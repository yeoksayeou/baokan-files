    We watched the visiting performance of the Lao Patriotic Front Art Troupe with brotherly affection for the fighting Lao people.

    We have a very deep revolutionary friendship with the Lao people who are standing on the front line of the anti-American struggle. When we learned from the newspapers that the Lao patriotic armed forces and people had achieved brilliant victories in the battle of Phou Kout Mountain in the liberated area of ​​Xieng Khouang Province in the first three months of this year, and recently defeated the enemy's attacks five times in a row, severely damaging the heroic deeds of the enemy, we couldn't help but rejoice in the victory of the Lao people. When we saw that the Lao Patriotic Front Art Troupe, which the Lao people call the "revolutionary art troupe," once again used song and dance performances with national characteristics to introduce us to the life and struggle of the Lao people, we were also happy for every achievement of this art troupe. Their performances embody the spirit of the Lao people under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front and Prince Souphanouvong to dare to struggle and dare to win, and enhance our understanding of the fighting Lao people.

    In the evening party, we saw eight beautiful dance programs. These eight dances all have revolutionary content, reflecting the Lao people of all ethnic groups' struggles, production, and new life from various aspects; at the same time, these dances all have extremely strong national characteristics, shining with the unique artistic brilliance of this nation, revealing a distinct national character and profound national feelings. Among them, the dances with the strongest combat colors and revolutionary spirit are "Shield Dance" and "Triumphant Dance." "Shield Dance" reflects the fighting life of the Lao Ting people. This dance uses fiery enthusiasm, sonorous sword strikes, fierce pounces, and increasingly intense rhythms to shape the image of a heroic nation with a firm fighting spirit, resisting aggression, and defending national independence. "Triumphant Dance" depicts the scene of the people in the Lao liberated areas singing and dancing to welcome the triumphant Lao People's Liberation Army, showing the close relationship between the army and the people in the liberated areas. This dance has a very good interlude in its structure: it uses the method of having the Liberation Army soldiers tell the masses about the battle situation in the celebration scene, skillfully reproducing their heroic combat process on the stage. This interlude makes the image of the Liberation Army soldiers appear taller, and at the same time greatly enhances the combat atmosphere of the entire dance, portraying the fish-and-water relationship between the people and their soldiers more deeply and meticulously, and artistically making the dance of national form have a more distinct atmosphere of the times.

    Many of the dances performed at the evening party have another great feature, that is, they use more lyrical dance forms to portray the Lao people's love for their motherland, the Lao Patriotic Front and their leaders, as well as their love for labor and life through the unique dance movements of the nation, showing their firm confidence in the revolution and their joy in the life of the liberated areas. Dances such as "Lotus Lantern Dance" and "Morning Glow Dance," which sing the praises of the people's unity and struggle and the bright future, and the solo dance "Moonlight Dance," which sings the praises of the happy life of girls in the liberated areas, all have such characteristics. These dances are all lyrical dances, and they all express thoughts and feelings and portray them in a more detailed way through symbolic dance images. In addition, "Lao Song Tribe Dance" and "Celebrating Harvest Dance" also belong to the lyrical dance genre, but the colors are more intense, the lines are clearer, and they are closer to life, with specific life scenes. These rich and colorful dances can help us better understand the Lao people's thoughts, lives, and art.

    The musical performances of the evening party were equally moving. Almost all of the songs are processed and improved on the basis of folk songs. They sing the feelings of the times through national tunes, among which the Luang Prabang folk song "Katon," which praises the Lao Patriotic Front and Prince Souphanouvong, the Upper Laos folk songs "De Mang No" and "Lang Wei," which praise the Lao people's unity against imperialism, and the Lower Laos folk song "De Tan Mada," which praises the Lao People's Liberation Army soldiers, are the most impressive. The lead singing, harmony, and band accompaniment of "Katon" are very distinctive, the tune is enthusiastic and optimistic, and the xylophone and drum sounds of the accompaniment are rich in changes, and they are integrated with the singer's emotions and echo each other. Even if we do not understand the Lao language, we can feel the Lao people's love for their leaders and their confidence in the struggle. The performance of the female chorus "De Tan Mada" is also successful. The adapter and singers have handled this Lower Laos folk song very well, which is completely suitable for the characteristics of female singing and has a very distinct imagery. As for the two folk songs "De Mang No" and "Lang Wei," they have long been familiar to the Chinese people and have become popular programs often heard on our radio stations and stages. Being able to hear Lao comrades sing this time makes us feel even more cordial.

    In the musical programs, what is most unforgettable is the large number of Chinese songs sung by Lao comrades in clear Chinese language and with sincere and enthusiastic feelings. When we heard songs such as "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," "On the Golden Mountain in Beijing," "Chairman Mao Comes to Our Village," "Inscription for Female Militia," and "Commune Members Are All Sunflowers," the beautiful and moving singing deeply touched our hearts.

    The comrades of the Lao Patriotic Front Art Troupe, despite encountering many obstacles and difficulties in the war-torn environment over the past few years, have carried their luggage themselves with a revolutionary spirit, climbed mountains and crossed rivers to perform for the troops and in the countryside. These performances not only brought cultural life to the vast number of soldiers and farmers, but also encouraged their labor and fighting spirit.

    We warmly welcome the performance of the Lao Patriotic Front Art Troupe. They serve the Lao people's anti-American and national salvation struggle with revolutionary song and dance art. Their performances will surely inspire the Chinese people and strengthen the fighting solidarity between the Chinese and Lao people.

    增进革命友谊的老挝歌舞
    ——看老挝爱国战线党文工团的访华演出
    叶林
    我们带着对战斗的老挝人民的兄弟般的亲切感情，观看了老挝爱国战线党文工团的访问演出。
    对于站在反美斗争第一线的老挝人民，我们有着极为深厚的革命友谊。当我们从报章上知道了老挝爱国军民今年头三个月在川圹省解放区富科特山的战斗中取得了辉煌胜利，最近又接连五次打败敌人的进攻，重创敌人的英雄事迹的时候，不禁为老挝人民的胜利感到欢欣鼓舞。当我们看到了被老挝人民称为“革命的文工团”的老挝爱国战线党文工团又一次地用具有民族特色的歌舞表演，向我们介绍了老挝人民的生活和斗争的时候，我们也为这个文工团的每一个成就而感到高兴。他们的演出，体现了老挝人民在老挝爱国战线党和苏发努冯亲王领导下的敢于斗争、敢于胜利的精神，增进了我们对战斗的老挝人民的了解。
    在晚会中，我们看到了八个优美的舞蹈节目。这八个舞蹈都是具有革命内容的，它们从各个方面来反映出老挝各族人民的战斗、生产和新的生活；同时，这些舞蹈又都具有极为浓厚的民族特色，处处闪耀着为这个民族所特有的艺术光彩，流露着一种鲜明的民族性格和深刻的民族感情。在这里面，最具有强烈战斗色彩和革命精神的舞蹈是“盾牌舞”和“凯旋舞”。“盾牌舞”是反映老听族人民的战斗生活的，这个舞蹈用火一样的热烈感情，铿锵的刀击，勇猛的扑杀，越来越激烈的节奏，塑造了具有坚强斗志、反抗侵略、捍卫民族独立的英雄民族的形象。“凯旋舞”描写老挝解放区人民载歌载舞地迎接凯旋的老挝人民解放军的情景，表现了解放区的亲密的军民关系。这个舞蹈在结构上有一段很好的穿插：它让解放军战士们在联欢场面中向群众叙说战斗情况的办法，在舞台上巧妙地重现了他们英勇的战斗过程。这一段穿插，把解放军战士的形象显得高大起来了，同时也使整个舞蹈的战斗气息得到大大的增强，把老百姓和子弟兵的鱼水情谊描绘得更加深刻细致，在艺术上使民族形式的舞蹈具有了更鲜明的时代气息。
    晚会上表演的许多舞蹈，还有一个很大的特色，那就是它们更多地采用抒情舞蹈的体裁，通过民族特有的舞蹈动作来刻划老挝人民对祖国、对老挝爱国战线党和领袖的热爱，以及对劳动、对生活的热爱，表现出他们对革命的坚定信心和对解放区生活的喜悦。象歌颂人民团结斗争和光辉前途的“荷花灯舞”和“朝霞舞”，歌颂解放区姑娘幸福生活的独舞“月下舞”，都带有这样的特点。这些舞蹈都是抒情舞，都是通过象征性的舞蹈形象来表现思想感情，刻划比较细致。此外，象“老松族舞”和“庆丰收舞”，也是属于抒情舞的体裁，而色彩比较强烈，线条也比较明朗，更接近生活一些，有具体的生活情景。这些丰富多采的舞蹈，都可以帮助我们更好地了解老挝人民的思想、生活和艺术。
    晚会的音乐表演，也是同样动人的。所有的歌曲几乎都是在民歌的基础上加工提高而成的。它们通过民族的音调唱出了时代的感情，其中以歌颂老挝爱国战线党和苏发努冯亲王的琅勃拉邦民歌《卡通》，歌颂老挝人民团结反帝的上寮民歌《得芒诺》和《浪韦》，歌颂老挝解放军战士的下寮民歌《得坦马达》，给人的印象最为深刻。《卡通》的领唱、伴唱和乐队伴奏都很有特色，音调热情乐观，伴奏的木板琴和鼓声音色富有变化，和歌唱者的感情既溶成一体，又有呼应，即便我们听不懂老挝语言，也可以体会出老挝人民对领袖的热爱和对斗争的信心。女声小合唱《得坦马达》的表演也是成功的，改编者和演唱者把这首下寮民歌处理得很出色，完全适合女声演唱的特点，有很鲜明的形象性。至于《得芒诺》和《浪韦》这两首民歌，则早已为中国人民所熟悉，成为我们的广播电台和舞台上常听到的流行节目了。这次能够听到老挝同志演唱，更加感到亲切。
    在音乐节目中，最使人不能忘怀的是老挝同志用清晰的中国语言和真挚热烈的感情所演唱的大量中国歌曲。当我们听到了《大海航行靠舵手》《在北京的金山上》《毛主席来到咱农庄》《为女民兵题照》以及《社员都是向阳花》等歌曲的时候，优美动听的歌声深深地打动了我们的心。
    老挝爱国战线党文工团的同志们，几年来尽管在战火纷飞的环境中碰到许多阻碍和重重困难，但他们以革命的精神，自己挑着行李，爬山涉水深入部队、农村演出。这些演出不仅为广大战士、农民带来了文化生活，而且鼓舞了他们的劳动和战斗精神。
    我们热烈地欢迎老挝爱国战线党文工团的演出，他们以革命的歌舞艺术为老挝人民的反美救国斗争服务，他们的演出必能同样鼓舞中国人民，加强中老两国人民的战斗团结。
