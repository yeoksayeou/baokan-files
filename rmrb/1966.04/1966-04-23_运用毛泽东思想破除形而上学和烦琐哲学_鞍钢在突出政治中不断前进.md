    Using Mao Zedong Thought to Break Down Metaphysics and Sophistry
    Angang Advances Continuously by Emphasizing Politics
    Editor's Note: Should modern large enterprises undergo revolution? Can they undergo revolution? This was once a debated question. Today, the report in this newspaper about Angang's continuous advancement in emphasizing politics definitively answers: modern large enterprises must also undergo revolution.
    According to the Party's general line for socialist construction, our policy for running industry is to emphasize both large and small and medium-sized enterprises. Large enterprises are the backbone of China's industry, a powerful force in the national economy, and the most concentrated place for the working class. Therefore, the significance and role of large enterprises emphasizing politics and realizing revolutionization are even greater.
    Angang's experience tells us that many large enterprises still retain, to varying degrees, bourgeois management ideas. To realize the revolutionization of large enterprises, it is necessary to break down foreign erroneous frameworks, break down Chinese erroneous frameworks, break down all capitalist management ideas and methods, and liberate ourselves from metaphysics and sophistry.
    In recent years, Angang has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and striven to emphasize politics. Its appearance has changed and continues to change. Of course, modern large enterprises like Angang have the characteristics of continuity and complexity. A single action can easily affect the whole situation. Whether some of its major measures are correct or not often takes a period of time to see more clearly. Therefore, it is necessary to combine a high degree of revolutionary spirit with a strict scientific attitude, and everything must be tested through experimentation in order to better achieve the goal of revolutionization.
    It is encouraging that Angang, China's largest iron and steel complex, has undergone great changes. We hope that the comrades of Angang will guard against arrogance and impetuosity and continue to move forward. At the same time, we hope that all large enterprises across the country can implement enterprise revolutionization in a planned and step-by-step manner.
    Many comrades who have visited Angang before and are now revisiting Angang have a common feeling: Angang has been continuously advancing in emphasizing politics in recent years.
    In this largest combined enterprise in our country, many factories and mines, many workshops, are filled with the revolutionary vitality of youth. The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought shines brighter and brighter, the mass movement is healthier, the experience is more comprehensive, and therefore the production situation is better than ever before, the flowers of technical innovation and technical revolution are blooming more and more, and many sites and many workshops are very clean - about 800,000 tons of garbage have been removed in two years.
    The Path of Running Enterprises According to Mao Zedong Thought is Established
    Some old ideas, old styles, and old habits have also been removed along with the garbage. Some are still being removed. It has been more than seventeen years since Angang became a socialist state-owned enterprise. During this period, Angang's production and construction, under the leadership of the Party and with the efforts of all employees, has undergone great development; however, it has also taken some tortuous paths.
    Angang is an old enterprise and has accumulated rich experience. Angang is also a large combined enterprise with relatively advanced equipment and occupies an important position on the industrial front. If it is not restricted by metaphysics and sophistry and combines learning from foreign countries with originality, and continuously revolutionizes in large enterprises, then Angang can play an increasingly greater role. However, for a period of time, the foreign set of erroneous frameworks had a relatively large impact.
    Carrying out a great revolution in such a large combined enterprise is not easy. On the one hand, metaphysics and sophistry have become habitual forces; on the other hand, the enterprise is large and complex, and a partial change will affect the overall situation, so it must be carefully considered and resolutely decided.
    However, the struggle must be carried out. Is it to stubbornly adhere to foreign and various erroneous frameworks, or to run enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought and create our own path? Is it to rely on the masses or to manage the masses? Is it to rely on the majority or to rely on the minority? This is the center of the struggle between the two lines of running enterprises in Angang.
    The struggle is undulating and advancing in waves. From learning from the People's Liberation Army and Daqing in 1964 to the current new revolution, it is the climax of the struggle between the two lines of running enterprises in Angang.
    Since the beginning of this year, especially in the recent two months, the entire company has conducted a major discussion on emphasizing politics in terms of the relationship between politics and business, the relationship between management and the masses, and the relationship between theory and practice.
    In this struggle, Mao Zedong Thought continuously breaks down metaphysics and sophistry, overcomes the bourgeois line of running enterprises, and establishes the glorious path of running enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought.
    Many comrades in Angang adhere to emphasizing politics, combine Mao Zedong Thought with the actual situation of their enterprise, and study and apply it creatively, so that Angang has made relatively great progress in recent years. They use Mao Zedong Thought to compare their own ideological style and gradually establish a complete and thorough worldview of serving the people; use Mao Zedong Thought to compare their own enterprise management and gradually establish the enterprise management policy of the mass line; and use Mao Zedong Thought to compare their own technical situation and carry out the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution.
    In Angang, studying Chairman Mao's works has become a compulsory course in every unit. Every technical work team spends a quarter of its time each week studying Chairman Mao's works. It is common to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform one's own position and viewpoints. There are also many examples of using Mao Zedong Thought to solve major technical problems. The new technology of red ore flotation with a high level is gradually mastered under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Some activists in technical cooperation voluntarily connect and gather once a week in workers' dormitories to study Chairman Mao's works. Some workers who live in Liaoyang and Haicheng, because the road is far and they cannot participate in the study after get off work, what should they do? Organize and use the time on the train to study and discuss.
    Driven by this strong political atmosphere, intellectuals have also made new progress in self-transformation. Angang has several thousand engineering and technical personnel who have graduated from universities and colleges. They have made great progress in the upsurge of revolutionization and in the study of Chairman Mao's works. Many technical personnel actively participate in labor, combine with workers, study diligently, and climb the peak of world metallurgical science and technology. In recent years, many of them have been promoted to engineers, and some have also joined the Communist Party.
    With the great changes in people's spiritual outlook, and various practical measures have been taken, the production technology of Angang has gradually undergone great changes and entered a new stage of development.
    In general, Angang has made relatively great progress in recent years, but it must be seen that development is still uneven. Advanced units like the seamless steel pipe factory, like the construction department which learn from the People's Liberation Army and Daqing relatively well, have not yet been popularized. It is still necessary to continue to use Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon to continuously revolutionize and continuously move forward.
    Gradually Establish a Complete and Thorough Worldview of Serving the People
    Angang's continuous advancement in emphasizing politics is first manifested in ideological style.
    The fundamental purpose of socialist enterprises is to strive to better serve the people. The whole country has supported Angang, and Angang has indeed supported the whole country. However, for a period of time, due to the influence of metaphysical foreign frameworks, Angang did not all handle matters according to Mao Zedong Thought in how to better serve users, which is essentially serving the people.
    At that time, Angang's attitude towards accepting other people's orders was: I produce what I produce, and you have to use what I produce. And it was: once the goods leave the door, I will not recognize them. If you want to protest, I will counter-protest. It is said that some countries do it this way. Some comrades commented: The contract signed with Angang is a "hegemon contract," you have to take it whether you want it or not.
    In the past, when talking about these issues, some comrades always overly emphasized the characteristics of large-scale, continuous production of large combined enterprises, without regarding it as a matter of the ideological style of a socialist enterprise, a major issue of whether politics is in command or not.
    The revolutionary upsurge of learning from the People's Liberation Army and Daqing is washing away every corner of the country, and also washing away the leading organs and the vast number of employees of Angang. The issue of serving users is brought to the agenda of ideological struggle of all comrades in Angang.
    In 1964, a major discussion on working for whom and serving whom was carried out for several consecutive months. In this major discussion, the first step was that people discovered that the "hegemon contract" was not any other problem, but that Mao Zedong Thought was not in command, and was restricted by metaphysical foreign frameworks. After further discussion, people discovered that Mao Zedong Thought was not in command because their worldview and outlook on life had not been thoroughly transformed. What was in their hearts was only one Angang, not the entire country, nor the entire people. "Once the goods leave the door, I will not recognize them," is there anything the same between this and the proletariat's view of completely and thoroughly serving the people? Isn't this the business philosophy of bourgeois enterprises?
    The revolutionary struggle opened a gap from here, and then the metaphysical foreign frameworks were greatly broken down, and people were sent to visit users all over the country to solicit opinions, and many specific measures were taken in a timely manner. What is the situation now?
    We see that the idea of completely and thoroughly serving the people has been gradually concretized in Angang. That is: you order what you want, and I will produce what I can, and overcome the difficulties myself. If the product really does not meet the user's requirements, it will be returned and modified until the user is satisfied. Others make suggestions, accept them humbly, and publish the user's criticism to the masses, and there is no more counter-protest. Finally, the more than 50,000 contracts signed in 1965 were completed on time, with quality, and with quantity after all kinds of efforts. In short, Angang, which was once said to be the "oldest," is now emphasizing politics, breaking metaphysics, establishing Mao Zedong Thought, and is a good scene of striving for progress.
    The Enterprise Management of the Mass Line is Gradually Established Angang's continuous advancement in emphasizing politics is also manifested in the management of the enterprise.
    The management line of socialist enterprises is to rely on the masses for management. Without following the mass line, there is no proletarian enterprise management.
    Opposed to this management line is the management line of a few people running enterprises by copying foreign frameworks. According to this management line, metaphysics and sophistry will inevitably become very popular.
    Angang has suffered from this kind of copying of foreign frameworks: more and more people, more and more forms. At one time, there were nine people specializing in stamping seals on material requisition and issue forms, averaging 10,000 seals per day. The rules and regulations became more and more cumbersome, and for a small matter handled by the grassroots to the company, it had to go through more than a dozen procedures and dozens of days to solve it. Some could not be solved for several years. There were many rules from above, only emphasizing division of labor, not emphasizing integration; only emphasizing mutual restraint, not emphasizing mutual promotion. It is said that this is also a kind of foreign "rule." As a result, there was a lot of buck-passing, a lot of involvement, and problems were often not solved.
    Does such management promote the development of productive forces, or does it hinder the development of productive forces? In the great wave of revolutionization, the erroneous frameworks in enterprise management have been greatly touched, and many comrades feel that they must consciously revolutionize.
    Any enterprise must have management, and must have management agencies. But management must rely on the masses, and must follow the mass line. Management agencies must be streamlined, and must provide the greatest convenience for the grassroots and the masses. Any modern enterprise cannot be without rules and regulations every minute, and correct and scientific rules and regulations can not only ensure production, but also promote production. But we don't want metaphysical and sophistical rules and regulations, and we don't want rules and regulations that are divorced from production practice. After the major discussion of serving whom in 1964, people made progress in their understanding, and then the company took the practical action of "going downstairs and leaving the courtyard," and organized management personnel to go to the front line of production to work and serve in a planned manner. In this way, a wave of revolutionization began in the management organs. What is the situation now?
    The management personnel of the company have been streamlined by about one-third compared to 1963. Among the existing cadres, an average of several thousand people participate in labor on the job every day. The management organs of the company also send a part of the people to form dozens of roving comprehensive service groups to go to dozens of grassroots production units to investigate and research and solve problems. Since the first roving comprehensive service group was organized in October 1964, thousands of relatively important problems have been solved. Many "old, bearded" difficult problems have also been solved relatively quickly.
    People who have been squatting in the small circle of the office for a long time, once they enter the vast world of mass struggle, breathe fresh air, have more dialectics in their minds, less of all kinds of metaphysics and sophistry, and solve problems more quickly.
    When the roving service group first went down, some comrades often worried: would this weaken management? More than a year of practice has made people realize that: always floating on the top can only "calculate accounts to death" and "calculate dead accounts," not only can not promote production, but even hinder production; serving at the grassroots level, understanding the actual situation, can make the upper strength used properly, promote production, strengthen management, and not weaken management.
    Now, the scope of the roving service of the company's organs has been expanded from production and technology to medical treatment and life welfare, and is welcomed by the grassroots and the masses.
    The feelings of a deputy director of the sales department of the company after he went down are very thought-provoking. He said: "In the past, looking down from above, I felt that everything was safe and sound, and there were no problems. Now, participating in the roving service group, looking up from below, I feel that there are many problems, and we must revolutionize." The difference between up and down is so great.
    The revolution of Angang's enterprise management is only the beginning, and it cannot be said that the problem has been solved. It can be imagined that for Angang, which has dozens of production factories and mines, the revolution of enterprise management is a problem that needs to be treated seriously and carefully. Some things still need to be practiced and need to be understood. However, the path of enterprise leading organs facing the grassroots, facing the masses, and cadres going to the grassroots and to the masses to work and serve in a planned manner is definitely the right one.
    Politics Commands Technology, Technology is Constantly Innovating Angang's continuous advancement in emphasizing politics is also manifested in production technology.
    Large foreign enterprises cannot engage in the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, that is, "the tiger's ass cannot be touched." Technology is a matter for a few technical experts. This metaphysical foreign framework has had an adverse impact on Angang's production technology. When many enterprises much smaller than Angang have technical innovation and technical revolution in full swing, and new technologies, new processes, new materials, and new equipment are emerging one after another, Angang is a bit like a pool of stagnant water.
    Now the situation has completely changed. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, a revolutionary upsurge has emerged on Angang's technical front.
    The first characteristic of this revolution is that politics commands technology. On the one hand, breaking down metaphysics, on the basis of the ideological revolutionization of people, breaking down the situation where a few people monopolize technology, making technical innovation and technical revolution a broad mass movement. On the other hand, technical personnel, through the technical revolution movement, creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, further strengthen the combination of technical personnel and workers, strengthen the laborization of intellectuals, so that the technical revolution also becomes a revolution of training and transforming people. Both of these aspects have now begun to have significant achievements in Angang.
    The second characteristic of this revolution is that, in the mass movement, appropriate organizational forms are adopted according to actual needs. The technical work team is a new thing in Angang. There are now twenty-nine technical work teams in the entire company. There are twenty-two at the company level. The members of these work teams, including scientific and technical personnel from various relevant units, are to attack particularly major scientific and technological barriers. This is like the field army, the fist of technical revolution. Seven factory-level technical work teams (mainly composed of technical personnel and old workers in the positions of this factory, established to solve major technical problems in this factory), as well as the vast number of technical personnel in the positions, are like local troops.
    Dozens of professional groups led by the mass technical cooperation committee, with about a thousand technical backbones (the vast majority of whom are workers, and some are technical personnel), have united more than 20,000 activists to participate in technical cooperation activities in the city, the company, and the unit. Wang Chonglun, the organizer of technical cooperation activities and a labor model, said: We are like an ocean of "militia." The combination of technical work teams and mass technical cooperation has converged into a powerful torrent of technical innovation and technical revolution, and a good situation of "people's war" has emerged on Angang's technical front.
    The third characteristic of this revolution is daring to practice and having clear goals. The tiger's ass can be touched. Large modern enterprises must also continuously carry out technical revolutions, otherwise they will definitely fall behind. Now, in various important links such as mining and beneficiation, ironmaking, steelmaking, and steel rolling in this large metallurgical enterprise, technical innovation and technical revolution are being carried out. They call the goal of technical revolution red flowers. The entire company will open four big red flowers in beneficiation, ironmaking, steelmaking, and steel rolling this year, catching up with and surpassing the world's advanced levels. In some important economic and technical indicators, we must also strive to enter the world's first-class ranks. Each factory and mine has its own goals of technical innovation and technical revolution, and they call these small red flowers. Politics commands technology, and technology can be continuously innovated. This is a true portrayal of the great changes in Angang. Great Changes Have Begun, the Struggle is Still Continuing
    The results brought about by Mao Zedong Thought's continuous breaking down of metaphysics and sophistry and the great rise of the revolutionary style are: 1965 became the year when Angang truly and comprehensively completed the state plan in recent years. In this year, the quality and variety of steel reached an unprecedented new level, a batch of advanced new products were created, the integrity rate of equipment was greatly improved, the mining work, which has always been a weak link, has been greatly improved, and some economic indicators have reached the world's advanced level. What is particularly worth mentioning is that the spiritual outlook of the people has changed, and Angang is becoming a revolutionary melting pot for steelmaking and people-making.
    However, the comrades in Angang always emphasize again and again: the great changes have begun, but the struggle is still continuing. They always say: We are still far from Daqing, and we are not strong enough in many aspects. We must not be complacent and must not be arrogant. Just like steel rails need to be quenched to be wear-resistant, we must also bury our heads in hard work in a solid manner.
    Talking about ideals and talking about the prospects for the future, they are full of energy and determined to carry out a great revolution in this large enterprise. But they also understand very well: we must calm down and not rush, they emphasize very much that understanding cannot be interrupted, and we must guide production struggle and scientific experiments through practice, and gradually grasp the inherent regularity of objective things. Carrying out a revolution in this large enterprise with dozens of production units, we must take care of the overall situation with a single action, and we must have a particularly strict scientific attitude. They said: We must move forward steadily.
    It can be believed that as long as the people of Angang have mastered Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to emphasizing politics, and continuously overcome shortcomings, the appearance of Angang will have an even greater change.

    运用毛泽东思想破除形而上学和烦琐哲学
    鞍钢在突出政治中不断前进
    编者按：一些现代化的大企业，要不要革命？能不能革命？这曾经是一个有过争论的问题。今天本报发表的鞍钢在突出政治中不断前进的报道，肯定地回答：现代化的大企业，同样必须革命。
    根据党的社会主义建设总路线，我们办工业的方针是，大型企业和中小型企业并举。大企业是我国工业的骨干，是国民经济的强大力量，是工人阶级最集中的地方，因此，大企业突出政治，实现革命化，它的意义和作用更为重大。
    鞍钢的经验告诉我们：不少大企业还程度不同地保留着资产阶级的经营管理思想。大企业要实现革命化，一定要打破外国的错误框框，打破中国的错误框框，打破一切资本主义经营思想和管理方法，从形而上学和烦琐哲学中解放出来。
    鞍钢这几年高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，努力突出政治，它的面貌已经起了并且继续起着变化。当然，象鞍钢这样的现代化大企业，具有连续性、复杂性的特点，牵一发易动全局，它采取的一些重大措施，是正确的，还是不正确的，往往要经过一段时间，才能看得比较清楚。因此，一定要把高度的革命精神和严格的科学态度结合起来，一切经过试验，才能更好地实现革命化的目的。
    鞍钢是我国最大的钢铁联合企业，它的面貌起了大变化，是令人振奋的。希望鞍钢的同志们戒骄戒躁，不断前进。同时希望全国所有的大企业，都能有领导有步骤地实行企业的革命化。
    鞍钢近几年来，在突出政治中不断前进，这是曾经到过鞍钢，现在重到鞍钢的许多同志的共同感觉。
    在这座我国最大的联合企业里，不少厂、矿，不少车间，充满了革命青春的朝气。毛泽东思想的光辉越照越亮，群众运动更健康了，经验更全面了，因而生产形势比过去任何时候都好，技术革新和技术革命的花朵日益盛开，许多场地和不少车间十分整洁——两年中，约有八十多万吨的垃圾已经被清除出去。
    确立了按毛泽东思想办企业的道路
    一些旧思想、旧作风和旧习惯，也同垃圾一起被清除出去了。有些还正在清除中。鞍钢成为社会主义全民所有制的企业，已经有十七年多了。这期间，鞍钢的生产建设，在党的领导下，在全体职工的努力下，有了极大的发展；但是，也走过一些曲折的道路。
    鞍钢是一个老企业，积累了丰富的经验。鞍钢又是一个大联合企业，设备比较先进，在工业战线上处于重要地位。如果不受形而上学和烦琐哲学的束缚，把学习外国和独创结合起来，在大企业中不断革命，那末，鞍钢就能发挥出越来越大的作用。可是，有一个时期，外国的一套错误框框，曾经发生过比较大的影响。
    在这样一个大联合企业中，进行大革命，是不容易的。一方面，形而上学和烦琐哲学已成为习惯势力；一方面，企业大而复杂，一个局部的变革，都会影响全局，必须深思熟虑，多谋善断。
    然而，斗争是必须进行的。是死守住外国的和各种各样的错误框框，还是按毛泽东思想办企业，创出一条自己的路？是靠群众还是管群众？是靠多数人还是靠少数人？这就是在鞍钢两条办企业路线的斗争的中心。
    斗争是时起时伏，波浪式地向前展开的。从一九六四年学解放军，学大庆开始直到现在的新的革命，是鞍钢两条办企业路线的斗争高潮。
    今年以来，特别是最近两个多月，全公司又在政治和业务的关系、管理和群众的关系、理论和实践的关系等方面，进行了一场突出政治的大讨论。
    在这个斗争中，毛泽东思想不断破除形而上学和烦琐哲学，战胜了资产阶级办企业路线，确立了按毛泽东思想办企业的光辉道路。
    鞍钢的许多同志，坚持突出政治，把毛泽东思想和本企业的实际结合起来，活学活用，使得鞍钢这几年有了比较大的进步。他们用毛泽东思想对照自己的思想作风，逐步树立起完全的、彻底的为人民服务的世界观；用毛泽东思想对照自己的企业管理，逐步确立了群众路线的企业管理方针；用毛泽东思想对照自己的技术状况，开展了技术革新和技术革命的群众运动。
    在鞍钢，学习毛主席著作已成为各个单位必修的课程。各个技术工作队每周以四分之一的时间学毛主席著作。用毛泽东思想改造自己的立场、观点，这是普遍的。用毛泽东思想解决重大技术问题的事例也屡见不鲜。具有很高水平的红矿浮选的新技术，就是在毛泽东思想指引下，逐步掌握的。有些技术协作的积极分子，自愿串连，每周在工人宿舍区集中学一次毛主席著作。一些家住在辽阳、海城的工人，因为路远不能在下班后参加学习，怎么办？组织起来，利用坐火车的时间学习和讨论。
    在这种浓厚的政治空气的带动下，知识分子的自我改造，也有了新的进展。鞍钢有好几千名从大专学校毕业的工程技术人员，他们在革命化的高潮中，在毛主席著作的学习中，有了很大的进步。不少技术人员积极参加劳动，同工人结合，刻苦钻研，攀登世界冶金科学技术的高峰。这几年，他们中间的不少人已提拔为工程师，有些人还参加了共产党。
    随着人的精神面貌的大变化，又采取了各种切实的措施，鞍钢的生产技术的面貌也逐步起了大变化，进入了一个新的发展时期。
    总的说来，鞍钢这几年有了比较大的进步，但是要看到，发展还是不平衡的。象无缝钢管厂这样大庆式的先进单位，象修建部这样学解放军、学大庆学得比较好的单位，还没有普遍化。还需要继续用毛泽东思想作为尖锐的武器，不断革命，不断前进。
  逐步树立完全、彻底为人民服务的世界观
    鞍钢在突出政治中不断前进，首先表现在思想作风方面。
    社会主义企业的根本目的是力求更好地为人民服务。全国支援过鞍钢，鞍钢也确实支援了全国。然而有一段时间，由于形而上学的洋框框的影响，鞍钢在如何更好地为用户服务，实质上也就是为人民服务的问题上，并不是都按毛泽东思想办事的。
    那时候，鞍钢接受别人订货合同的态度是：我生产什么，你就得用什么。而且是：货物出门，概不认账。你要抗议，我就反抗议。据说，有的国家就是这样办的。有的同志议论：同鞍钢订的合同，是“霸王合同”，要也得要，不要也得要。
    在过去，谈起这些问题，一些同志总是过份强调大联合企业的大规模、连续性生产的特点，而不把它看成是一个社会主义企业的思想作风问题，是一个政治挂帅不挂帅的重大问题。
    学解放军、学大庆的革命化的春潮，涤荡着全国各个角落，也涤荡着鞍钢的领导机关和广大职工。为用户服务问题，提到鞍钢全体同志的思想斗争的日程上来。
    在一九六四年，连续几个月开展了为谁劳动为谁服务的大讨论。在这个大讨论中，第一步，人们发现“霸王合同”，原来不是什么别的问题，而是毛泽东思想没有挂帅，被形而上学的洋框框束缚住了。讨论再深一步，人们发现：毛泽东思想没有挂帅，是自己的世界观、人生观还没有彻底改造。心中装着的只有一个鞍钢，没有整个国家，也没有全体人民。“货物出门，概不认账”，这同无产阶级完全、彻底为人民服务的观点，有任何相同之处吗？这不是资产阶级办企业的经营思想吗？
    革命化的斗争从这里打开了缺口，随着就大破形而上学的洋框框，派人到全国各地访问用户，征求意见，并及时采取了许多具体办法。现在的情况怎样呢？
    我们看到完全、彻底为人民服务的思想，在鞍钢已经逐步具体化了。这就是：你订什么货，我尽可能生产什么，有困难自己克服。产品确实不合用户的要求，管退，管改，直到用户满意为止。别人提意见，虚心接受，而且，把用户的批评向群众公布，再没有什么反抗议了。最后，一九六五年订的五万多项合同，经过千方百计的努力，百分之百地按时、按质、按量完成了。总之，曾经被人们说成是“老大”的鞍钢，如今突出政治，破了形而上学，立了毛泽东思想，是一派力争上游的好景象。
    群众路线的企业管理逐步确立了鞍钢在突出政治中不断前进，还表现在企业的管理方面。
    社会主义企业的管理路线，是依靠群众进行管理。不走群众路线，便没有无产阶级的企业管理。
    同这条管理路线相对立的，就是照搬洋框框的少数人办企业的管理路线。按照这条管理路线办事，形而上学和烦琐哲学必然大为盛行。
    鞍钢曾经吃过这种照搬洋框框的苦头：人越来越多，表报越填越多。有一个时期，专门有九个人在领料发料单上盖图章，平均每天要盖一万个图章。规章制度越来越烦琐，基层到公司来办一件不大的事情，要经过十几道手续，几十天才能解决。有的几年也解决不了。上面条条很多，只强调分工，不强调综合；只强调相互制约，不强调相互促进。据说，这也是一种外国的“规矩”。结果扯皮很多，牵扯很大，问题往往解决不了。
    这样的管理究竟是促进了生产力，还是阻碍了生产力的发展呢？在革命化的大浪潮中，企业管理中的错误框框受到了很大的触动，许多同志感觉到必须自觉革命了。
    任何一个企业，都必须要有管理，要有管理机构。但是管理必须依靠群众，必须走群众路线。管理机构必须精干，必须为基层为群众提供最大的方便。任何一个现代化的企业，每一分钟都不能没有规章制度，正确的、科学的规章制度，不仅能保证生产，而且能促进生产。但是不要形而上学和烦琐哲学的规章制度，不要脱离生产实践的规章制度。经过一九六四年为谁服务的大讨论，人们在认识上进了一步，接着公司就采取了“下楼出院”的实际行动，有计划地组织管理人员到生产第一线去劳动，去服务。这样，就在管理机关中开始掀起了革命化的波澜。现在的情况怎样呢？
    公司的管理人员，比一九六三年，已经精简了三分之一左右。现有的干部中，平均每天有几千人参加岗位上的劳动。公司的管理机关，还派出一部分人组成几十个巡回综合服务组，分工到几十个基层生产单位去调查研究，解决问题。从一九六四年十月，组织第一个巡回综合服务组以来，已经解决了成千个比较重要的问题。不少“长了胡子”的老大难的问题，也比较快地解决了。
    人们长期蹲在办公室的小圈子中，一旦进入群众斗争的广阔天地，呼吸到新鲜的空气，脑子里边的辩证法多了，各种各样的形而上学和烦琐哲学少了，解决问题也就比较快了。
    巡回服务组刚刚开始下去的时候，有些同志常常担心：这样做，会不会削弱了管理？一年多的实践使人们认识到：老是浮在上边，只能“死算账”、“算死账”，不仅不能促进生产，甚至妨碍生产；服务到基层，了解实际，能使上劲用上力，对生产有所促进，是加强了管理，而不是削弱了管理。
    现在，公司机关的巡回服务的范围，已经从生产、技术，扩展到医疗、生活福利等方面，受到基层和群众的欢迎。
    公司的一位销售处的副处长谈他下去后的感想是很能令人深思的。他说：“过去从上面朝下看，觉得平平安安，没有什么问题。现在参加巡回服务组，从下往上看，就觉得问题不少，非革命不可。”一上一下，差别是这样大。
    鞍钢的企业管理的革命，还只是开始，还不能说问题已经解决了。可以想象，对于拥有几十个生产厂矿的鞍钢来说，企业管理的革命，是一个需要严肃、仔细对待的问题。有一些事情，还有待于实践，有待于认识。但是，企业领导机关面向基层，面向群众，干部有计划地到基层、到群众中去劳动，去服务的路子，肯定是走对了。
    政治统帅技术，技术不断革新  鞍钢在突出政治中不断前进，还表现在生产技术方面。
    大洋企业不能搞技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，也就是“老虎屁股摸不得”。技术是少数技术专家的事。这种形而上学的洋框框，曾经给鞍钢的生产技术带来不利的影响。当许多比鞍钢小得多的企业，技术革新和技术革命如火如荼，新技术、新工艺、新材料、新设备层出不穷，而鞍钢却有点象一潭死水。
    现在情况完全变了，鞍钢的技术战线，在毛泽东思想的指引下，出现了一个革命的春潮。
    这个革命的第一个特点是政治统帅了技术。一方面，大破形而上学，在人的思想革命化的基础上，打破了少数人垄断技术的局面，使技术革新和技术革命成为一个广大的群众运动。一方面，技术人员通过技术革命运动，活学活用毛主席著作，进一步加强技术人员和工人群众的结合，加强知识分子的劳动化，使技术革命同时成为一个锻炼人、改造人的革命。这两个方面，鞍钢现在都开始有了显著的成绩。
    这个革命的第二个特点是，在群众运动中，根据实际需要，采取了恰当的组织形式。技术工作队是鞍钢的一个新事物。现在全公司有二十九个技术工作队。公司一级的有二十二个。这些工作队的成员，包括各个有关单位的科学技术人员，是为了攻打特别重大的科学技术关的。这好比是野战军，是技术革命的拳头。七个厂一级的技术工作队（主要是本厂岗位上的技术人员和老工人组成的，为了解决本厂重大的技术关键而设立的），以及广大的岗位上的技术人员，好比是地方部队。
    由群众性的技术协作委员会领导的几十个专业组，有一千左右技术骨干（其中绝大部分是工人，也有一些技术人员），他们又团结了二万多积极分子，参加全市、全公司、本单位的技术协作活动。技术协作活动的组织者、劳动模范王崇伦说：我们好比是“民兵”的海洋。技术工作队和群众性的技术协作相结合，汇合为一股技术革新和技术革命的强大洪流，在鞍钢的技术战线上，出现了“人民战争”的大好形势。
    这个革命的第三个特点是勇于实践，目标鲜明。老虎屁股是能摸的。大型的现代化的企业也必须不断进行技术上的革命，否则就一定要落在后面。现在，在这个大冶金企业的矿山选矿、炼铁、炼钢、轧钢等各个重要环节上，都在进行技术革新和技术革命。他们把技术革命的目标称作红花。全公司今年要在选矿、炼铁、炼钢和轧钢方面开四朵大红花，赶超世界先进水平。在一些重要的经济技术指标上，也要力争进入世界第一流的行列。各个厂矿，都有自己的技术革新和技术革命的奋斗目标，他们把这些叫做小红花。政治统帅了技术，技术就能不断革新，这是鞍钢大变化的一个真实的写照。	  大变化开始了，斗争尚在继续中
    毛泽东思想不断破除形而上学和烦琐哲学，大兴革命化之风所带来的成果是：一九六五年，成为鞍钢这些年来真正全面地完成国家计划的一年。这一年，钢材的质量和品种达到了一个前所未有的新水平，创造了一批高级的新产品，设备的完好率大为提高了，一直成为薄弱环节的矿山工作，有了很大的改进，有一些经济指标，已经达到了世界上的先进水平。特别值得提出的是，人的精神面貌变了，鞍钢正在成为一座炼钢又炼人的革命大熔炉。
    但是，鞍钢的同志们总是一再强调：大变化是开始了，而斗争尚在继续中。他们总是说：我们离大庆还远，我们有许多方面还不过硬。我们一定不能自满，不能骄傲。就象钢轨需要淬火才耐磨一样，我们还要结结实实地埋头苦干一番。
    谈到理想，谈到对未来的展望，他们的劲头很足，决心要在这个大企业中实行大革命。但是他们也很懂得：要沉住气，不能着急，他们十分强调认识不能中断，一定要通过实践来指导生产斗争和科学实验，逐步掌握客观事物本来的规律性。在这个拥有几十个生产单位的大企业中进行革命，牵一发都要照顾到全局，格外要有严格的科学态度。他们说：我们一定要稳步前进。
    可以相信，鞍钢人只要掌握了毛泽东思想，坚持突出政治，不断克服缺点，鞍钢的面貌还会有一个更大的变化。
