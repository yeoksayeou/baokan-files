    Head of Chinese Journalists Delegation Mei Yi Speaks at AASJA Secretariat Meeting
    Establish the Broadest and Truest International Anti-American United Front of the World's People
    Must be based on the solidarity of the world's revolutionary people, and must never include the running dogs, accomplices, and conspirators of U.S. imperialism
    Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd – Mei Yi, head of the Chinese Journalists Delegation, stated at the Fourth Plenary (Enlarged) Meeting of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association (AASJA) on the 22nd that he fully agreed with the Secretary-General Djawoto's report. He emphasized that, in order to maximize the isolation and strike against U.S. imperialism, it is necessary for the people of the world to further expand and strengthen the international united front against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. He said that this should be the broadest and truest international anti-American united front, which should be based on the solidarity of the world's revolutionary people, and must never include the running dogs, accomplices, and conspirators of U.S. imperialism.
    He pointed out that modern revisionists, centered on the Soviet leadership group, are doing their utmost to conspire with U.S. imperialism and reactionaries of various countries to establish a reactionary alliance aimed at China. Their recent clamoring for a "anti-war united front" is a direct counter to our proposed international united front against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.
    In his speech, Mei Yi also analyzed the current excellent international situation. He pointed out that the great turbulence, great division, and great reorganization of the international situation is a reflection of the in-depth development of the world's people's anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle. The current appearance of some counter-revolutionary currents essentially reflects the imminent arrival of a new, more solid, and more violent storm of people's revolutionary struggle.
    Mei Yi began his speech by expressing support for the temporary withdrawal of the AASJA Secretariat from Jakarta. He said that after the Indonesian right-wing forces launched a counter-revolutionary military coup last October with the support of U.S. imperialism, they closed down a large number of Indonesian progressive newspapers, arrested and massacred progressive journalists, and at the same time, wantonly interfered with and obstructed the work of the Asian-African Journalists Association Secretariat stationed in Jakarta, making it impossible for the Secretariat to carry out its work. Under these circumstances, the Secretariat had no choice but to temporarily withdraw from Jakarta.
    Mei Yi said: As everyone knows, the Indonesian right-wing generals group usurped power, launched a counter-communist and anti-people frenzy throughout the country, implemented mass arrests and massacres by the most barbaric means of terror, and turned the entire beautiful archipelago into a fascist prison and slaughterhouse. At the same time, the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces frantically opposed China, persecuted Chinese nationals, unreasonably closed down the Xinhua News Agency Jakarta branch, and recently even went so far as to openly dispatch armed forces, together with right-wing thugs, to attack the Chinese Embassy, injure Chinese diplomats, and occupy the Chinese Consulate General. The Indonesian reactionaries' shocking and heinous crimes have aroused the unparalleled indignation of all righteous people.
    Mei Yi said that Chinese journalists resolutely condemn and strongly protest the fascist crimes of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces. We deeply care about and sympathize with our Indonesian colleagues who have been persecuted for adhering to the truth, and express our admiration for their unyielding spirit.
    Mei Yi then discussed the current international situation. He said that at present, the people of the world are engaged in an unprecedented and fierce struggle with their most vicious enemy, U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. On the one hand, revolutionary struggles are rising everywhere, and on the other hand, U.S. imperialism and its running dogs are continuously instigating reactionary coups in some places. Under these circumstances, various political forces in the world are undergoing fierce division and reorganization. The whole world is in a process of great turbulence, great division, and great reorganization.
    He said that facing such a dramatically changing international situation, the mouthpieces of imperialism, on the one hand, are exclaiming that the world is in a "state of chaos," and on the other hand, are clamoring that "the East Wind does not seem to be prevailing over the West Wind." The propaganda machines of those modern revisionists who fear revolution, oppose revolution, and surrender to imperialism are shouting that the situation is "deteriorating," fearing that the revolutionary storm launched by the people of the world will shatter their beautiful dreams of cooperating with U.S. imperialism. However, we, the progressive journalists, believe that this current great turbulence, great division, and great reorganization is a reflection of the in-depth development of the world's people's anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle. In essence, and from the perspective of development trends, the situation is very good, not very bad, and it is favorable to the people of the world, not to imperialism and reactionaries of various countries.
    Mei Yi said that to look at the situation, we must mainly look at the mainstream. The national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America continue to surge, the anti-American tide is surging all over the world, the people of the world are increasingly awakening, and the revolutionary forces of the world are constantly growing. This is the mainstream of the current international situation. Of course, there are also counter-currents in the current international situation. However, the temporary whirlpools created by counter-revolutionary currents cannot stop the mainstream of the world's people's revolutionary struggle from surging forward. The counter-revolutionary currents essentially reflect the imminent arrival of a new, more solid, and more violent storm of people's revolutionary struggle. As historical experience has proven countless times, the people are truly powerful, not imperialism and reactionaries of various countries. The mainstream of the people's revolutionary struggle promotes the progress of history and determines the fate of the world. Today, at this historical juncture where revolutionary forces and counter-revolutionary forces are engaged in fierce struggle, we, the progressive journalists of Asian and African countries, should courageously throw ourselves into the fiery struggle of the revolutionary people of the world against U.S. imperialism and reactionaries of various countries, and use our unique weapons—pens, cameras, and microphones—to expose the counter-revolutionary and anti-people conspiracies and crimes of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, to inspire the fighting spirit of the people of various countries, and to advance the struggle of the Asian and African people against imperialism and new and old colonialism.
    Mei Yi said that at present, the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. struggle for national salvation is the focus of the world's people's anti-imperialist struggle. The struggle and victory of the Vietnamese people powerfully contain and weaken the aggressive forces of U.S. imperialism, which is very beneficial to the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries. Vigorously supporting the just struggle of the Vietnamese people has become an inescapable international obligation for the people of the world, especially the people of Asian and African countries.
    Mei Yi said that we must also note that while U.S. imperialism is stepping up its expansion of the war, it continues to play the "peace talks" trick, attempting to use counter-revolutionary dual tactics to force the Vietnamese people to submit. In this regard, the followers and partners of U.S. imperialism are actively working for its grand conspiracy. We, the progressive journalists of Asian and African countries, must resolutely expose the "peace talks" scam that U.S. imperialism and its accomplices are trying to peddle, and fully support the Vietnamese people in carrying out the anti-U.S. struggle for national salvation to the end.
    Mei Yi said: The Soviet leaders also say a few words against U.S. aggression and in support of the Vietnamese people's struggle, but in reality, they want to sacrifice the interests of the Vietnamese people to make a deal with U.S. imperialism. In order to pursue cooperation with the United States to dominate the world, they have tried every means to peddle the "peace talks" scam for the United States and serve U.S. imperialism's continued occupation of South Vietnam. They use various propaganda machines to distort the just stand of the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. struggle for national salvation, publicize that Johnson has the sincerity to "negotiate," advocate that the Vietnamese issue can only be resolved through "negotiations," and even especially energetically slander China for obstructing the transit of Soviet "aid materials," trying to provoke the relationship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people. No wonder the American bourgeois press also does not hide the fact that Washington policymakers believe that the Soviet leaders are "brokers helping us achieve a decent peace in Vietnam."
    Mei Yi pointed out that the national liberation movement in Asia and Africa is entering a new stage. The people of Asian and African countries more urgently than ever need to further develop the struggle against imperialism and new and old colonialism and its running dogs. However, the propaganda machine of modern revisionists, centered on the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, continues to tirelessly spread the same old clichés of so-called "peaceful coexistence," saying that "colonialism has disappeared," and that "even a small spark can cause a world war," and so on. Their purpose is nothing more than to whitewash the sharp contradictions between imperialism and new and old colonialism headed by the United States and the oppressed nations, to paralyze the revolutionary will of the Asian and African people, and to force all oppressed nations to abandon the revolutionary struggle for liberation and forever endure the oppression and enslavement of imperialism and its running dogs. The newspapers controlled by the Soviet revisionist leadership group have long degenerated into apologists for neo-colonialism, acting as accomplices of imperialism and new and old colonialists, disintegrating the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial revolutionary struggle of the Asian and African people, and playing a role that imperialism and new and old colonialists cannot play. Therefore, we, as progressive journalists of Asia and Africa, while resolutely exposing the aggressive and war policies of imperialism headed by the United States, cannot but resolutely expose the criminal acts of these imperialist accomplices who serve imperialism.
    Mei Yi said: The ugly face of U.S. imperialism as the common enemy of the people of the world has never been as clearly exposed as it is today; and its situation has never been as isolated and difficult as it is today. This most vicious and brutal imperialism is struggling madly, attempting to save its fate of destruction. Faced with this situation, the people of the world, in order to maximize the isolation and strike against U.S. imperialism, need to further expand and strengthen the international united front against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. This should be the broadest and truest international anti-American united front, which should be based on the solidarity of the revolutionary people of the world, because they are the ones who truly want revolution. This united front should include all countries and peoples who are subjected to aggression, control, interference, and bullying by U.S. imperialism, but it must never include the running dogs, accomplices, and conspirators of U.S. imperialism. The modern revisionists, centered on the Soviet leadership group, are flying the banners of "anti-imperialism" and "revolution," but in reality, they do not oppose U.S. imperialism, do not support the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries, and are bent on seeking cooperation with U.S. imperialism to dominate the world, helping U.S. imperialism and its running dogs maintain the so-called "world order" of enslaving the people of various countries. Wherever there is tension, they collude with U.S. imperialism to restore "calm," and wherever the flames of anti-imperialist revolutionary war are ignited, they act as U.S. imperialism's voluntary fire brigade to extinguish the "fire." They are doing their utmost to conspire with U.S. imperialism and reactionaries of various countries to establish a reactionary alliance aimed at China, but in reality, it is against the people of the world, against the national liberation movement, and against the people's revolution. Their so-called "anti-war united front" that they have recently clamored for is actually a united front against China, which holds high the anti-imperialist revolutionary banner, and against the revolutionary people of the world. It is a direct counter to our proposed international united front against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. We cannot unite with such people. Are we to unite with them to kneel down and surrender to U.S. imperialism? Are we to unite with them to betray the interests of the revolutionary people of various countries? Are we to unite with them to oppose China? If our international united front includes them, what kind of international united front against U.S. imperialism would it be?
    Mei Yi said: The Asian-African Journalists Association, like all fighting organizations, has been tempered in struggle and is constantly growing in the storm.
    Regarding the future work of the Asian-African Journalists Association, he put forward four specific suggestions to the meeting: First, vigorously call on and mobilize the vast number of Asian and African journalists to actively participate in and promote the struggle of the Asian and African people against imperialism and new and old colonialism, and point the main spearhead of the struggle at the common enemy of the world, U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. Second, further strengthen the unity of the Asian and African people and Asian and African journalists in the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle, continuously develop the friendship and cooperation between Asian and African journalists, and at the same time maintain a high degree of vigilance against the destructive conspiracies of imperialism and its accomplices and carry out resolute struggles against them. Third, vigorously carry out activities to support the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. struggle for national salvation, and continue to regard this task as one of the most important tasks of the Asian-African Journalists Association, calling on all progressive Asian and African journalists to use newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and other tools to truthfully report on the heroic struggles and brilliant victories of the Vietnamese people, support their just stand, and expose and condemn the aggression and war crimes of U.S. imperialism and all kinds of "peace talks" conspiracies. Fourth, strongly condemn the persecution by imperialism and reactionaries of various countries of progressive journalists who are fighting for independence, democracy, and freedom, especially to denounce the crimes of the Indonesian reactionary forces in the large-scale persecution and massacre of progressive journalists.

    我新闻工作者代表团团长梅益在亚非记协书记处会议上发言
    全世界人民建立最广泛最真实的国际反美统一战线
    必须以世界革命人民的团结为基础，决不包括美帝的走狗、帮凶和同谋者
    新华社二十三日讯　中国新闻工作者代表团团长梅益二十二日在亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议（扩大）上发言时，表示完全同意总书记查禾多的报告，他强调说，全世界人民为了最大限度地孤立和打击美帝国主义，有必要进一步扩大和加强反对美帝国主义及其走狗的国际统一战线。他说，这应当是一条最广泛最真实的国际反美统一战线，它应以全世界革命人民的团结为基础，决不能包括美帝国主义的走狗、帮凶和同谋者。
    他指出，以苏联领导集团为中心的现代修正主义者，正在竭力同美帝国主义和各国反动派策划建立一个矛头针对中国的反动联盟。他们最近叫嚷的“反战统一战线”，是同我们所主张的反对美帝国主义及其走狗的国际统一战线唱对台戏的。
    梅益在这次发言中，还分析了当前大好的国际形势。他指出，国际形势的大动荡、大分化、大改组，是世界人民反帝革命斗争深入发展的反映。目前出现的一些反革命逆流，实质上正是反映了一个新的更加扎实、更加猛烈的人民革命斗争的风暴即将来临。
    梅益在发言中首先对亚非记协书记处暂时撤离雅加达表示支持。他说，去年十月，印度尼西亚右派势力在美帝国主义的支持下发动反革命军事政变之后，大量封闭印度尼西亚进步报纸，大肆逮捕、屠杀进步新闻工作者，同时对驻在雅加达的亚非新闻工作者协会书记处横加干涉和阻挠，使书记处的工作无法进行。在这种情况下，书记处除了暂时从雅加达撤出之外，已别无选择。
    梅益说：人所共知，印度尼西亚右派将领集团篡夺了政权，在全国范围内掀起了一个反共反人民的狂潮，以最野蛮的恐怖手段，实行大逮捕、大屠杀，把整个美丽的千岛之国，变成一座法西斯的大监狱和大屠场。与此同时，印度尼西亚右派反动势力疯狂反华，大肆迫害中国侨民，无理封闭新华社雅加达分社，最近竟发展到公然出动武装部队伙同右派暴徒袭击中国大使馆，打伤中国外交官，占领中国总领事馆。印度尼西亚反动派种种骇人听闻的滔天罪行，激起了一切正义的人们的无比愤慨。
    梅益说，中国新闻工作者坚决谴责和强烈抗议印度尼西亚右派反动势力的法西斯罪行。我们深切关怀和同情由于坚持真理而遭受迫害的印度尼西亚同业们，并对他们坚贞不屈的精神表示敬佩。
    梅益接着论述了当前的国际形势。他说，当前，全世界人民正在同他们的最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义及其走狗进行着空前激烈的大搏斗。一方面革命斗争到处兴起，而另一方面美帝国主义及其走狗在一些地方连续策动反动政变。在这种情况下，世界各种政治力量正在进行剧烈的分化和重新组合。整个世界都处于大动荡、大分化、大改组的过程中。
    他说，面对着这样激烈变化的国际形势，帝国主义的喉舌一方面惊呼世界陷于“一团混乱”，一方面又叫嚷什么“东风似乎并不压倒西风”。那些害怕革命反对革命、投降帝国主义的现代修正主义者的宣传机器，则叫喊形势“恶化”，唯恐世界人民掀起的革命风暴，打破它们同美帝国主义合作的美梦。但是，我们进步的新闻工作者，认为当前的这种大动荡、大分化、大改组，是世界人民反帝革命斗争深入发展的反映。从本质看，从发展趋势看，形势是好得很，而不是糟得很，是有利于世界人民，而不利于帝国主义和各国反动派。
    梅益说，看形势主要要看主流。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动在继续高涨，全世界的反美怒潮汹涌澎湃，世界人民在日益觉醒，世界人民的革命力量在不断壮大，这就是当前国际形势的主流。当然，目前的国际形势中也存在着逆流。但是，反革命逆流造成的一些暂时的漩涡，决不能阻挡世界人民革命斗争的主流奔腾向前。反革命的逆流，实质上正是反映了一个新的更加扎实、更加猛烈的人民革命斗争的风暴即将来临。正如历史经验已经千百次证明过的那样，真正有力量的是人民，而不是帝国主义和各国反动派。人民革命斗争的主流推动着历史的前进，决定着世界的命运。今天，在革命力量和反革命势力进行激烈搏斗的这个历史关头，我们亚非各国进步的新闻工作者，应当百倍奋勇地投身到全世界革命人民反对美帝国主义和各国反动派的火热的斗争中去，并且运用我们特有的武器——笔、照相机和麦克风，去揭露美帝国主义及其走狗反革命、反人民的阴谋和罪行，鼓舞各国人民的斗志，推进亚非人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争。
    梅益说，目前，越南人民的抗美救国斗争，是全世界人民反帝斗争的焦点。越南人民的斗争和胜利，有力地牵制和削弱着美帝国主义的侵略力量，十分有利于世界各国人民的革命斗争。大力支持越南人民的正义斗争，已成为全世界人民，特别是亚非各国人民的不可推卸的国际义务。
    梅益说，我们还必须注意到，美帝国主义正在一面加紧扩大战争，一面继续玩弄“和谈”骗局，妄图利用反革命的两手策略来迫使越南人民屈服。在这方面，美帝国主义的追随者和合伙者，都在积极为它的这个大阴谋积极效力。我们亚非各国进步的新闻工作者，必须坚决揭露美帝国主义及其帮凶所竭力兜售的“和谈”骗局，全力支持越南人民把抗美救国斗争进行到底。
    梅益说：苏联领导人嘴上也说几句反对美国侵略、支持越南人民斗争，实际上却想牺牲越南人民的利益来同美帝国主义做交易。他们为了追求同美国合作主宰世界，竟然千方百计替美国兜售“和谈”骗局，为美帝国主义继续霸占越南南方效劳。他们利用各种宣传机器，曲解越南人民抗美救国斗争的正义立场，宣传约翰逊有“谈判”诚意，鼓吹越南问题只能通过“谈判”解决，甚至特别起劲地诬蔑中国阻挠苏联“援助物资”过境，竭力挑拨中越人民的关系。无怪乎美国的资产阶级报刊也毫不掩饰，华盛顿的决策者认为苏联领导人是“帮助我们在越南实现体面的和平的掮客”了。
    梅益指出，亚洲和非洲的民族解放运动，正在进入一个新的阶段。亚非各国人民比过去任何时候都更加迫切需要进一步开展反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义及其走狗的斗争。但是，以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义者的宣传机器，却继续喋喋不休地散布那一套所谓“和平共处”的滥调，说什么“殖民主义已经消失”啦，什么“一个小小的火星也能够引起世界大战”啦，等等。他们的目的无非是想粉饰以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义同被压迫民族的尖锐矛盾，麻痹亚非人民的革命意志，要一切被压迫民族放弃争取解放的革命斗争，永远忍受帝国主义及其走狗的压迫和奴役。苏联修正主义领导集团所控制的报刊，早已堕落成为新殖民主义的辩护士，充当帝国主义和新老殖民主义者的帮凶，瓦解亚非人民的反帝反殖革命斗争，起着帝国主义和新老殖民主义者所不能起的作用。因此，我们，作为亚非进步的新闻工作者，在坚决揭露以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策的同时，不能不坚决揭露这些帝国主义的帮凶为帝国主义效劳的罪恶行径。
    梅益说：美帝国主义是全世界人民的共同敌人的凶恶面目，从来没有象今天这样暴露得清楚；它的处境也从来没有象今天这样的孤立和困难。这个最凶恶、最残暴的帝国主义，正在进行疯狂的挣扎，妄图挽救它灭亡的命运。面对着这种情况，全世界人民，为了最大限度孤立和打击美帝国主义，有必要进一步扩大和加强反对美帝国主义及其走狗的国际统一战线。这应当是一条最广泛的最真实的国际反美统一战线，它应当以全世界革命人民的团结为基础，因为他们是真正要革命的。这条统一战线，应当包括一切受到美帝国主义侵略、控制、干涉和欺负的国家和人民，然而决不能包括美帝国主义的走狗、帮凶和同谋者。以苏联领导集团为中心的现代修正主义者，打着“反帝”和“革命”的招牌，实际上却不反对美帝国主义，不支持各国人民的反帝革命斗争，而且一心谋求同美帝国主义合作主宰世界，帮助美帝国主义及其走狗维持奴役各国人民的所谓“世界秩序”。哪里出现紧张局势，他们就伙同美帝国主义去恢复“平静”，哪里燃起了反帝革命战争的火焰，他们就充当美帝国主义的义务消防队，去扑灭“火灾”。他们正在竭力同美帝国主义和各国反动派策划建立一个矛头针对中国、而实际上是反对世界人民、反对民族解放运动、反对人民革命的反动联盟。他们最近叫嚷的所谓“反战统一战线”，实际上是一个反对高举反帝革命旗帜的中国、反对世界革命人民的统一战线，是同我们所主张的反对美帝国主义及其走狗的国际统一战线唱对台戏的。对于这样一些人，我们是不能够同他们联合的。难道我们和他们联合一起来向美帝国主义屈膝投降吗？难道我们和他们联合一起来出卖各国革命人民的利益吗？难道我们同他们联合起来反对中国吗？我们的国际统一战线如果把他们包括在内，这还成其为什么反对美帝国主义的国际统一战线呢？
    梅益说：亚非新闻工作者协会正象所有战斗的组织一样，在斗争中取得锻炼，在风暴中不断成长。
    对于亚非新闻工作者协会今后的工作，他向会议提出四项具体建议：一、大力号召和动员广大亚非新闻工作者积极参加和推动亚非人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争，并把斗争的主要矛头指向全世界的共同敌人美帝国主义及其走狗。二、进一步加强亚非人民和亚非新闻工作者在反帝反殖斗争中的团结，不断发展亚非新闻工作者之间的友谊和合作，同时对帝国主义及其帮凶的破坏阴谋保持高度的警惕和进行坚决的斗争。三、大力开展支持越南人民抗美救国斗争的活动，并且继续把这一任务作为亚非新闻工作者协会最重要的任务之一，号召一切进步的亚非新闻工作者通过报纸、杂志、广播、电视等工具，如实地报道越南人民的英勇斗争和辉煌胜利，支持他们的正义立场，揭露和谴责美帝国主义的侵略和战争罪行和形形色色的“和谈”阴谋。四、强烈谴责帝国主义和各国反动派迫害为争取独立、民主和自由而斗争的进步新闻工作者，特别是声讨印度尼西亚反动势力对进步新闻工作者的大规模迫害和屠杀的罪行。
