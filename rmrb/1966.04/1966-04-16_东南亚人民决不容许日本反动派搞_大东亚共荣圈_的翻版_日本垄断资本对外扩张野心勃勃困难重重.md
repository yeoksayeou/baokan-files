    This newspaper reports that the recent "Southeast Asia Development Ministerial Conference" held in Tokyo fully exposed the Sato government and its backer, Japanese monopoly capital, adhering to the will of the United States, and under the guise of "aid and cooperation," expanding wildly into Southeast Asia with arrogant ambitions. As soon as the conference ended, the Japanese bourgeois press loudly proclaimed that "the Japanese government has sounded the trumpet for advancing into the Southeast Asian region."
    Japanese monopoly capital is so ambitious because it believes it has the means to expand. It is true that over the years since the war, due to the vigorous support of U.S. imperialism and the cruel exploitation of the domestic working people, Japan's monopoly capitalist economy has rapidly recovered and continued to expand. Today, Japanese monopoly capital groups have accumulated billions of wealth and possess enormous production capacity. In the capitalist world, Japan's production has surpassed France, ranking fourth only after the United States, West Germany, and Britain. In the capitalist world, its shipbuilding industry claims first place, electronics industry second place, steel and metal cutting machine tools fourth place, and automobiles fifth place. Now, the imperialist characteristics of Japan's monopoly capitalist economy are already present. Recently, it has increasingly blatantly put the slogan of aggression and expansion on its lips, ambitiously formulating various "economic development," "economic cooperation," "economic aid," and "coexistence and co-prosperity" infiltration blueprints, expanding to Southeast Asia one moment and Northeast Asia the next, with its tail held high.
    However, Japanese monopoly capital appears strong but is actually very weak at its core. First of all, insufficient funds are a major weakness. For example, in Japan's manufacturing industry, the average self-raised funds of enterprises in June 1965 accounted for only 19.9 percent of the total capital, which means that 80 percent of the capital came entirely from domestic and foreign loans. As of March 1964, Japan had imported more than $3.2 billion in foreign capital, making the Japanese economy a veritable "debt economy." Furthermore, Japan's current gold and foreign exchange reserves are only about $2 billion, of which only over $300 million is in gold. This amount of foreign exchange reserves is barely enough to meet its own import needs, and the international balance of payments is often on the verge of crisis. Insufficient funds create enormous difficulties for the overseas economic expansion of monopoly capital. It is well known that capital export is an important weapon for imperialism to control commodity sales markets and raw material supply areas, and an important foundation for forming an imperialist sphere of influence. Capital export requires money. In recent years, Japanese monopoly capital has tried its best to engage in capital export, but the amount is very small. In 1964, Japan's capital export was only $245 million, only one-third of West Germany's, and even less than the United States, France, and Britain. Japan's payment of "war reparations" to Southeast Asian countries and regions after the war is a form of state capital export, which has played an important role in driving the promotion of goods and plundering raw materials. However, now the "reparations" are almost fully paid. General capital exports have been declining year by year due to lack of funds and harsh loan conditions. Japanese monopoly capital already feels overwhelmed in terms of capital export.
    Secondly, Japan's intensified expansion into Southeast Asia is bound to lead to increasingly acute contradictions among imperialists. Due to its own weakness, Japan still has to rely on the United States and act as an accomplice of the United States. The United States wants to pull Japan as its vanguard in aggression, and of course cannot allow Japan to replace its own position. The "consistency" of interests between Japanese and American monopoly capital is temporary and relative, while the opposition and contradictions between the two are profound. The competition between Japan and imperialist countries such as Britain, France, and West Germany for markets will become increasingly fierce. According to the 1966 edition of the "Overseas Market White Paper" of the Japan External Trade Organization, West Germany's fertilizers and Britain's automobiles and automobile parts are very active in the Southeast Asian market, and Japanese products face fierce competition.
    In particular, the contradictions between the national capital and the broad masses of people in Southeast Asia and Japanese monopoly capital will inevitably deepen day by day with the intensification of the expansion of Japanese monopoly capital. Japanese newspapers have already reported that "resistance trends" have emerged in Southeast Asia towards Japan's "economic cooperation." There must be anti-aggression when there is aggression, and there must be resistance when there is infiltration.
    Now, although Japanese monopoly capital colludes with U.S. imperialism and expands under the guise of neo-colonialism, its aggressive face has gradually been seen through. Times have changed, and Japanese monopoly capital's attempt to revive the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" will never succeed.
    Of course, the nature of Japanese monopoly capital's external expansion will not change, and it will never retreat in the face of difficulties. On the contrary, the more it wants to get rid of difficulties, the more it wants to expand. Moreover, due to its own weakness, external expansion and plunder will inevitably be more cunning and hypocritical, and it will do anything as long as it can obtain high profits. This is determined by the nature of monopoly capitalism and is also the law of development of Japanese monopoly capitalism.

### 东南亚人民决不容许日本反动派搞“大东亚共荣圈”的翻版  日本垄断资本对外扩张野心勃勃困难重重

    东南亚人民决不容许日本反动派搞“大东亚共荣圈”的翻版
    日本垄断资本对外扩张野心勃勃困难重重
    本报讯　最近在东京召开的“东南亚开发部长会议”，充分暴露了佐藤政府及其后台日本垄断资本秉承美国意旨，在“援助合作”的幌子下，大举向东南亚扩张的狂妄野心。会议刚刚收场，日本资产阶级报刊便大肆宣传“日本政府吹响了向东南亚地区进军的喇叭”。
    日本垄断资本如此野心勃勃，是因为它自恃拥有扩张的本钱。不错，战后多年来，由于美帝国主义的大力扶植和对国内劳动人民的残酷压榨，日本垄断资本主义经济迅速恢复并且不断膨胀起来。今天，日本垄断资本集团积累了亿万财富，拥有巨大的生产能力。在资本主义世界中，日本的生产已赶过了法国，仅次于美国、西德和英国，居第四位。在资本主义世界，它的造船工业生产号称第一位，电子工业生产第二位，钢铁及金属切削机床第四位，汽车第五位。现在，日本垄断资本主义经济的帝国主义特征已经具备。近来，它越来越露骨地把侵略扩张的口号挂在嘴上，野心勃勃地制定各种各样的“经济开发”、“经济合作”、“经济援助”“共存共荣”、的渗透蓝图，一会儿向东南亚，一会儿向东北亚扩张，尾巴翘得老高。
    然而，日本垄断资本貌似强大，骨子里却实在虚弱得很。首先，资金不足就是它的一个很大的弱点。比如，以日本的制造工业来说，一九六五年六月企业平均的自筹资金仅占资本总额的百分之十九点九，也就是说得有百分之八十的资本全是来自国内外的借款。到一九六四年三月为止，日本输入外国资本共达三十二亿美元以上，日本经济成了名副其实的“借债经济”。再说日本目前的黄金外汇储备只有二十亿美元左右，其中黄金只有三亿多美元。这点外汇储备用来应付自己的进口需要很是紧巴巴的，国际收支经常处于危机边缘。资金不足，给垄断资本的海外经济扩张造成莫大的困难。人所共知，资本输出是帝国主义控制商品销售市场、原料供应地的重要武器，是形成帝国主义势力范围的重要基础。资本输出是需要出钱的。这些年来，日本垄断资本也尽力搞资本输出，然而数量很少。一九六四年日本资本输出只有二亿四千五百万美元，只及西德的三分之一，更比不上美、法、英了。战后日本对东南亚国家和地区支付的“战争赔偿”，是国家资本输出的一种形式，在带动推销商品和掠夺原料方面起过重要作用。但是，现在“赔偿”几乎快全部支付完毕。而一般资本输出又因资金缺乏和贷款条件苛刻，近年来数额逐年下降。日本垄断资本在资本输出方面已经感到力不从心。
    其次，日本对东南亚加紧扩张，势必引起帝国主义之间的矛盾日益尖锐化。日本由于本身软弱仍不能不依附美国，做美国的帮凶。而美国是要拉日本充当它的侵略的马前卒，当然不能允许日本取代自己的地位。日美垄断资本之间利益的“一致”是暂时的、相对的，而两者的对立、矛盾则是深刻的。日本同英、法、西德等帝国主义之间争夺市场的角逐也会越来越激烈。据日本贸易振兴会一九六六年版《海外市场白皮书》说：在东南亚的市场上，西德的化肥、英国的汽车及汽车部件很活跃，日本的产品遇到猛烈的竞争。
    特别是东南亚的民族资本和广大人民同日本垄断资本的矛盾，随着日本垄断资本扩张的加剧，必然会一天天深刻化。日本报刊已经报道，对于日本的“经济合作”，东南亚出现了“反抗的动向”。有侵略必然有反侵略，有渗透必然有抵制。
    现在，尽管日本垄断资本同美帝国主义勾结在一起，披着新殖民主义外衣进行扩张，然而它的侵略嘴脸已逐渐被识破。时代变了，日本垄断资本想搞“大东亚共荣圈”的翻版，是决不会得逞的。
    当然，日本垄断资本对外扩张的本质是不会改变的，它决不会知难而退。相反地，它越是要摆脱困难就越要扩张。而且由于它本身的虚弱，对外扩张掠夺必然更加狡猾虚伪，只要能捞到高额利润，它什么都能干得出来。这是垄断资本主义本质决定的，也是日本垄断资本主义的发展规律。
