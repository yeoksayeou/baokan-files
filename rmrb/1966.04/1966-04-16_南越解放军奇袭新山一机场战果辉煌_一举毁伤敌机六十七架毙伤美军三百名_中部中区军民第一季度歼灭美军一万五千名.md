    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 14th -- According to the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency, the Command of the Liberation Armed Forces in the Saigon-Gia Dinh area of South Vietnam issued a communique on the 13th, stating that a small unit of the Liberation Army in the Saigon-Gia Dinh area launched a surprise attack on Tan Son Nhut Airport on the northern outskirts of Saigon in the early hours of April 13th, achieving glorious results. Preliminary reports indicate that 67 aircraft of various types, including F-100, F-105, and B-57 jet fighters, were destroyed or damaged, and 300 American pilots and technicians were killed or wounded. A large oil depot within the airport exclusively for jet aircraft use was also hit and caught fire, with the fire still burning until noon on the 13th.

    The communique stated that Tan Son Nhut Airport is one of the largest airports used by the American aggressors in South Vietnam. In order to protect this airport, the American aggressors have established an extremely tight defense perimeter around the airport, laying layers of barbed wire, automatic landmines, and searchlight systems, with patrols on guard day and night.

    The communique stated that with the strong support of the people, the Liberation Army soldiers bravely infiltrated the outer areas of the airport and fiercely launched over 200 shells in succession at the airport runway, apron, pilots' quarters, and oil depot. The sound of explosions reverberated through the night sky, and the aircraft on the apron and the buildings inside the airport caught fire one after another, with flames soaring into the sky.

    The communique stated that the Liberation Army's victory in fiercely bombarding Tan Son Nhut Airport was a lightning strike against the American aggressors. Like the Liberation Army's recent victory in attacking the "Victoria Hotel" in Saigon, it powerfully proves that the Liberation Army has sufficient strength to strike all the enemy's important strongholds and any of their lairs.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 15th -- According to the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency, the military and civilians in the central Trung Bo region of South Vietnam fought continuously 1,479 times in the first three months of this year, thwarting the enemy's various "mopping-up operations," eliminating a total of 36,664 enemy troops, including 14,726 American aggressor troops killed and 545 wounded; completely annihilating 7 enemy battalions, 46 companies, and 59 platoons, including 4 American aggressor battalions and 13 companies. During this period, the military and civilians in the central Trung Bo region also shot down and destroyed 588 enemy aircraft of various types, damaged 153, and destroyed 289 enemy military vehicles and 20 artillery pieces ranging from 75mm to 155mm caliber.

    南越解放军奇袭新山一机场战果辉煌
    一举毁伤敌机六十七架毙伤美军三百名
    中部中区军民第一季度歼灭美军一万五千名
    新华社河内十四日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方西贡—嘉定地区解放武装力量指挥部十三日发表公报说，四月十三日凌晨，西贡—嘉定地区解放军一支小部队奇袭西贡北郊的新山一机场取得了辉煌战果。据初步消息，击毁击伤包括F—100、F—105和B—57型喷气式飞机在内的各种飞机六十七架，打死打伤美国飞行员和技术人员三百名。机场内一个专供喷气式飞机使用的大型油库也被击中起火，直到十三日中午大火仍在燃烧。
    公报说，新山一机场是美国侵略者在越南南方的最大的机场之一。美国侵略者为了保护这个机场，在机场周围设立了一个极其严密的防御圈，布下层层的铁丝网、自动地雷和探照灯系统，并有巡逻队日夜放哨。
    公报说，解放军战士们在人民的大力支援下，勇敢地潜入机场外围地区，猛烈地向机场跑道、停机坪、飞行员宿舍和油库连续发射了二百多发炮弹，爆炸声响彻夜空，停机坪上的飞机和机场内的建筑物纷纷起火，火光冲天。
    公报说，解放军猛烈轰击新山一机场的胜利，是对美国侵略者的一次闪电般的打击。它同解放军最近袭击西贡“维多利亚饭店”的胜利一样极其有力地证明：解放军有足够力量打击敌人所有重要据点和它们的任何一个巢穴。
    新华社河内十五日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方中部中区军民在今年头三个月中，连续作战一千四百七十九次，粉碎了敌人的各次“扫荡”，共消灭敌人三万六千六百六十四名，其中包括打死美国侵略军一万四千七百二十六名、打伤五百四十五名；全歼敌军七个营、四十六个连和五十九个排，其中包括美国侵略军四个营和十三个连。在这期间，中部中区军民还击落和击毁各种类型敌机五百八十八架，击伤一百五十三架，击毁敌人各种军车二百八十九辆和七十五毫米到一五五毫米口径的大炮二十门。（附图片）
