    The U.S. imperialists used B-52 type aircraft to bomb the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the 12th. This is a serious step by U.S. imperialism to continue expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam along the path of "gradual escalation." This new "escalation" by the American aggressors shows that in order to save themselves from defeat, they are determined to struggle frantically at all costs.
    Recently, the invading American troops suffered defeats in a series of "offensives" launched on the South Vietnamese battlefield, and the political struggle of the people in the American-puppet occupied areas has surged up again. The infighting among the South Vietnamese puppets has become increasingly fierce, and the situation of the American aggressors is even worse than before. In desperation, they had to resort to the worst possible tactics, attempting to rely on more vicious bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to force the Vietnamese people to submit, while at the same time trying to boost the ever-decreasing morale of the South Vietnamese puppets and quell the infighting within the puppet clique. From this, it can also be seen that the American aggressors, who are already at the end of their rope, do not have many options left.
    This move by U.S. imperialism is clearly futile. Since U.S. imperialism has carried out more than a year of frenzied bombing of North Vietnam and has not been able to intimidate the Vietnamese people, but on the contrary, has only continuously increased their hatred for U.S. imperialism and their determination to resist America and save the country, then could it possibly have any other result if it now expands the scale of this bombing? At the same time, when the United States' means of war blackmailing fails again, the morale of its lackeys will inevitably be even lower, and infighting will inevitably become more intense. There is no doubt about this. In short, it is completely a dream for U.S. imperialism to think that this will save it from the quagmire.
    Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out more than 20 years ago: "The rampancy of all internal and external dark forces has created national disasters; but this rampancy not only shows that these dark forces still have power, but also shows their final struggle, and shows that the masses of the people are gradually approaching victory." Isn't the situation of the Vietnamese people's struggle to resist America and save the country today exactly like this? The more frantically the American aggressors struggle, the closer they get to complete defeat and extinction.

### 越疯狂越接近灭亡

    越疯狂越接近灭亡
    美帝国主义十二日使用B—52型飞机轰炸越南民主共和国领土。这是美帝国主义沿着“逐步升级”道路继续扩大侵越战争的一个严重步骤。美国侵略者这一新的“升级”，表明它为了挽救败局，决意不顾一切地进行疯狂的挣扎。
    最近，侵越美军在南越战场上发动一系列“攻势”遭到了失败，美伪占领区人民的政治斗争又风起云涌，南越傀儡内讧日益激烈，美国侵略者的处境比过去更加不妙了。它在走投无路的情况下，只好出其下策，妄图依靠对越南民主共和国进行更加凶恶的轰炸，来迫使越南人民屈服，同时借以提高南越傀儡日益低落的士气。平息傀儡集团的内讧。由此也可以看到，已经日暮途穷的美国侵略者办法不多了。
    美帝国主义的这一招，显然是徒劳的。既然美帝国主义对越南北方进行了一年多的狂轰滥炸，并没有能够把越南人民吓倒，而且相反的只能不断增强他们对美帝国主义的仇恨和抗美救国的决心，那末，它现在再扩大这种轰炸的规模，难道就可能有其他的结果吗？同时，当美国这种战争讹诈手段再告破产，它的走狗的士气也必然要更加低落，内讧必然更加剧烈，这也是毫无疑问的。总之，美帝国主义认为这样就能把它从泥潭中挽救出来，这完全是梦想。
    毛泽东同志在二十多年前曾经指出：“一切内外黑暗势力的猖獗，造成了民族的灾难；但是这种猖獗，不但表示了这些黑暗势力的还有力量，而且表示了它们的最后挣扎，表示了人民大众逐渐接近了胜利。”今天越南人民抗美救国斗争的形势，不也正是这样吗？美国侵略者越是进行疯狂的挣扎，它就越是接近彻底的失败和灭亡。
