    Only Armed Struggle Can Drive Out the American Aggressors
    “We Dominicans know how to speak clearly with the language of weapons, without fear. The April Constitutionalist Uprising clearly showed the people that American imperialism only understands the language of weapons. Only when the masses, under the leadership of the working class, and based on the worker-peasant alliance, set off a revolutionary storm, and when the masses use just and necessary revolutionary violence, can American imperialism be contained.”
    —Speech by Guido Gil, head of the Dominican delegation, at the Tricontinental Conference
    “Revolutionary practice and a correct understanding of the nature of imperialism prove to us every day that we must actively prepare to launch a life-and-death war against the oppressive forces headed by American imperialism, and mobilize the broadest masses of the people to rise up against American imperialism.”
                  —Resolution of the First Preparatory Congress of the Dominican People's Movement
    “If there is no foundation of workers and peasants, then the democratic revolution cannot be carried through to the end. And in underdeveloped countries like ours, the basic form of peasant participation in the struggle is armed struggle…
    “Therefore, our Dominican People's Movement says that the worker-peasant alliance is the fundamental foundation of the anti-imperialist front. For example, in our country, the way to realize this alliance is armed struggle.”
                        —*Libertad*, organ of the Dominican People's Movement
    “The Dominican people who oppose imperialism love peace, progress, and democracy, but they know that armed struggle can only cease after the interventionist troops withdraw from our country, because there can be no peace between our people and their oppressors. Therefore, the Dominican people will not hand over their weapons to the Organization of American States or anyone else.”
                                —*El 14 de Junio* of the Dominican Republic
    “The real strength lies in the people, in the masses. Peasants make up the majority of our country's population. If they engage in armed struggle under the leadership of revolutionaries, then not only can they defeat the domestic reactionaries, but we can defeat the American army. American power is superficially strong, but it is not so in reality.”
    “We are not isolated, we are stronger than imperialism. As long as we persist in armed struggle, dare to face difficulties, and advance to the end, we will surely defeat them. Our rifles and machine guns are striking the enemy just like the rifles and machine guns of the South Vietnamese patriots, and they have inflicted serious defeats on the American aggressors.
    “We can and must launch people’s armed struggle in both urban and rural areas throughout the country, especially to get the peasants to participate in armed struggle, drive out the foreign oppressors, and establish democracy.
    “The people decide everything. Maintaining their unity and fighting spirit is a fundamental issue. Any position that guides the people’s effective armed struggle toward the utopian paths that imperialism has blocked in the past and will continue to block in the future is essentially divisive. Any position that seeks to hinder the development of armed struggle throughout the country is essentially divisive.
    “Our people do not want to live as they did before and have already taken up arms to fight. The reactionaries cannot subdue them. This is the reality.
    “The Dominican problem is not a question of elections or a provisional government, but a question of the people fighting against the exploiters who use violence to enslave them.”
                          —Statement by the Dominican June 14 Revolutionary Movement

    只有进行武装斗争才能赶走美国侵略者
    “我们多米尼加人懂得用武器的语言来明确地讲话，无所畏惧。四月的护宪起义清楚地向人民表明了，美帝国主义只懂武器的语言，只有在人民群众在工人阶级领导下，以工农联盟为基础掀起革命的风暴前，当人民群众使用正义的、必要的革命暴力的时候，美帝国主义才能被遏制住。”
    ——多米尼加代表团团长吉多·希尔在亚非拉三洲会议上的发言
    “革命实践和对帝国主义本性的正确认识每天都向我们证明，我们必须积极准备展开一场反对以美帝国主义为首的压迫势力的殊死战争，使最广泛的人民阶层起来反对美帝国主义。”
                  ——多米尼加人民运动第一次预备代表大会决议
    “要是没有工农这个基础，那么民主革命就无法进行到底。而在象我国这样的不发达国家里，农民参加斗争的基本形式是武装斗争……
    “因此，我们多米尼加人民运动说，工农联盟是反帝阵线的根本基础。比如在我国，实现这个联盟的方式是武装斗争。”
                        ——多米尼加人民运动机关报《自由报》
    “反对帝国主义的多米尼加人民热爱和平、进步和民主，但是他们知道，只有干涉军撤出我国后，才能停止武装斗争，因为在我国人民及其压迫者之间不可能有和平。因此，多米尼加人民不会把自己的武器交给美洲国家组织和任何人。”
                                ——多米尼加《六月十四日报》
    “真正的力量就在人民之中，就在群众之中。农民占我国人口的大部分，要是他们在革命者的领导下投入武装斗争，那么，不仅能打败国内反动派，而且我们能够战胜美国军队，美国的力量表面上强大，实际上并不如此。”
    “我们并不孤立，我们比帝国主义强大。只要坚持武装斗争，敢于面对困难，前进到底，我们定将打败他们。我们的步枪和机枪同越南南方爱国者的步枪和机枪一样正在打击敌人，而他们已使美国侵略者遭到严重的失败。
    “我们能够、也必须在全国城乡开展人民武装斗争，特别是使农民参加武装斗争，把外国压迫者赶出去，建立民主。
    “人民决定一切。保持他们的团结和斗志是根本性的问题。把人民卓有成效的武装斗争导向帝国主义过去已经对人民堵塞而今后仍将堵塞的乌托邦道路的任何立场，实质上都是分裂。任何要阻碍在全国开展武装斗争的立场实质上都是分裂。
    “我国人民不愿象以前一样地生活，已经武装起来进行斗争。反动派不能使他们屈服。这是现实情况。
    “多米尼加的问题不是选举问题，也不是临时政府问题，而是人民为反对使用暴力来奴役他们的剥削者而斗争的问题。”
                          ——多米尼加六月十四日革命运动声明
