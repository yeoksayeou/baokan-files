    Small Celestial Bodies in the Solar System
    Zhou Fen

    In the vicinity of the sun, orbiting the sun, in addition to the nine major planets, there are also numerous asteroids, comets, meteors, and various gases and dust. The largest of the asteroids is called Ceres, with a mass only one eight-thousandth of the Earth's and a diameter of seven hundred and seventy kilometers. Although comets are very large in volume, their mass is only a few millionths or even a billionth of the Earth's.
    With the world's largest telescope today, the smallest visible asteroid is only one kilometer in diameter. In terms of size, this is very close to the largest meteors. Meteors that fall to Earth are called meteorites. The meteorite crater in Arizona, USA, is one and a half kilometers in circumference and about two hundred meters deep.
    Meteors and asteroids also have many similarities in shape, color, and reflectivity. Some believe that the smaller the diameter of this type of small celestial body, the greater the number. For example, there are only six large asteroids with a diameter of over two hundred kilometers, while more than sixteen hundred small asteroids are known; large meteors that fall to Earth are not many, but if you watch the night sky, you can always see several small meteors per hour.
    The smallest meteors are indistinguishable from interplanetary dust. It is the large amount of dust gathered on the ecliptic (the plane of the planetary orbits) that creates the famous zodiacal light—a faintly luminous cone. On clear, moonless spring days, the zodiacal light can be seen in the western sky after sunset; in autumn, before sunrise, this light can also be seen in the eastern sky.
    Meteors and comets clearly have an evolutionary connection. In 1846, people witnessed Biela's Comet dividing into two. The distance between the two small comets after the split continued to increase, eventually reaching more than 380,000 kilometers. In 1852, the two comets returned again, and the distance between them increased tenfold. After that year, these two comets were never seen again. However, according to calculations, these two comets should return every six and a half years. In 1872, Biela's Comet was closest to Earth. After careful observation by astronomers, it was not found. However, on the night of November 27 of the same year, when the Earth passed through the orbit of Biela's Comet, a very large meteor shower was observed. All the meteors seemed to radiate from a point in the constellation Andromeda. Calculations showed that this point was exactly where Biela's Comet was at the time. This indicates that Biela's Comet had disintegrated and transformed into a group of meteors. This meteor swarm still appears at the end of every November, but because it is gradually scattering in orbit, the meteor shower appears weaker from Earth each year. Since ancient times, China has put "comets, meteors, and meteorites" in the same category. Today, it seems that these small celestial bodies do indeed have a unity, are interconnected, and constantly transform.

    太阳系的小天体
    周芬
    在太阳周围、围绕着太阳运行的，除了九大行星以外，还有众多的小行星、彗星、流星和各种各样的气体和尘埃。小行星中最大的一个叫做谷神星，质量只有地球的八千分之一，直径是七百七十公里。彗星虽然体积很大，但质量只有地球的几百万分之一，有的甚至只有十亿分之一。
    用现在世界上最大的望远镜，所能看到的最小的小行星，直径只有一公里。就大小来说，这已经和最大的流星很相近。流星落在地球上来，叫做陨星。美国亚利桑那州的陨星坑，周围就有一公里半，深约二百米。
    流星和小行星在形状、颜色、反光本领等方面，也有很多相似之处。有人认为，这类小天体的直径越小，数目越大。例如，直径在二百公里以上的大型小行星只有六个，而已知小型的小行星已有一千六百多；落在地球上来的大流星不多，但你若去注视夜晚的星空，每小时总可以看到好几个小流星。
    最小的流星和行星际尘埃并无区别。正是聚集在黄道上（行星轨道平面上）的大量的尘埃造成了有名的黄道光——微弱发光的锥形体。在春季没有月亮的晴天，夕阳西下以后，在西方天空可以看到黄道光；秋季旭日东升以前，在东方天空也有这种光。
    流星和彗星显然具有演化上的联系。一八四六年人们亲眼看见比拉彗星一分为二，分裂后的两个小彗星之间的距离不断增加，最后达到三十八万多公里。一八五二年两个彗星再度回来，它们间的距离又增大了十倍。那一年以后，再没有看到这两颗彗星。但根据计算，每隔六年半这两颗彗星应回来一次，一八七二年比拉彗星最近地球，经天文工作者细心观测，并未发现。而在同年十一月二十七日的夜里，当地球穿过比拉彗星的轨道时，却看到一阵极大的流星雨，所有流星好象是从仙女座里一点散开似的。计算结果表明，这一点正好是当时比拉彗星所在的位置。这表明，比拉彗星已经粉身碎骨，而转变为一群流星了。这个流星群直到今天还在每年十一月底出现，不过由于它在轨道上逐渐散开，从地球上看来，这个流星雨已经一年比一年来得弱了。我国自古以来，就把“彗、流、陨”相提并论，今天看来，这些小天体的确具有统一性，彼此联系，而且不断转化。
