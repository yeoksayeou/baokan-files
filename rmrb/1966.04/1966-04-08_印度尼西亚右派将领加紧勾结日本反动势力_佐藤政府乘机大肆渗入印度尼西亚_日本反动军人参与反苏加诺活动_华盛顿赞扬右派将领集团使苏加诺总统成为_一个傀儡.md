    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 7th - News: After seizing state power, the Indonesian right-wing general group, while relying on the United States, is intensifying its collusion with the Japanese Sato government.
    According to Kyodo News Agency, Japanese Ambassador to Indonesia Saito visited Indonesian Foreign Minister Malik on the 5th, informing him of the Japanese government's decision to provide $2.5 million in "emergency economic aid" to Indonesia. Malik told Saito that Indonesia was preparing to send an economic delegation headed by Fourth Deputy Prime Minister Buwono to Japan to discuss strengthening "cooperative relations between the two countries" and new economic aid plans. This delegation will be formed by the end of this month. The Associated Press also reported from Jakarta on the 5th that this "powerful" Indonesian delegation will not only go to Japan but "may also go to Europe and the United States" to "seek urgently needed foreign aid." The delegation's "trip will be a major effort by the new government controlled by Suharto to obtain financial assistance for Indonesia."
    According to reports, the Indonesian right-wing military group has sent "secret envoys" to Japan several times for aid since the September 30th Incident. Many of them had close relations with Japanese militarists during the past Japanese imperialist occupation of Indonesia. The Japanese magazine "Modern Weekly" recently revealed that after the drastic changes in the Indonesian situation, Shojiro Kawashima, who once represented the Japanese ruling group in activities in Indonesia, has been replaced by Takeo Fukuda, a leader of the extreme right wing of the Liberal Democratic Party, and a group of former Japanese military personnel who "trained Suharto and the backbone of the army" "participated in planning secret anti-Sukarno activities." According to reports, Japan has provided $47 million in "emergency aid" to the Indonesian right-wing general group since the September 30th Incident.
    In order to please the Sato government, the new Indonesian regime changed its attitude of not participating in the so-called "Southeast Asian Development Ministers' Conference" convened by Japan and decided to sit together with puppet groups such as "Malaysia" and South Vietnam as an "observer" to beg Japan for long-term economic "aid."
    Suharto's approach of seeking "aid" from Japan is exactly what the Sato government wants. The Sato government, which has always followed the United States and is intensifying its expansion in Southeast Asia, is seizing this opportunity to extensively penetrate Indonesia. According to Japanese newspapers and periodicals, after the establishment of the new regime centered on Suharto, the Sato government decided to accelerate preparations to provide "emergency assistance" to Indonesia.
    Xinhua News Agency, 7th - American newspapers and news agencies, in commenting on the situation in Indonesia, unreservedly praised the right-wing general group for seizing state power and making President Sukarno a nominal head of state, a "puppet" in their hands.
    "The Christian Science Monitor" published an editorial saying: "The army has now reduced him (President Sukarno) to a position without power." "It now seems that power has unmistakably passed into the hands of the army. But keeping Sukarno in his gilded cage allows the army's control to have legitimacy in the current situation where Indonesia still worships a person as a god, and to use his name to bear the ultimate responsibility for the economic difficulties suffered by this naturally rich country."
    "The Washington Evening Star" published an article entitled "Sukarno Fades" saying: "Suharto is controlling the situation, and Sukarno has little hope of making a comeback." The article said, "If this proves to be the case, from the Western point of view, this can only be a welcome situation." The article said, "A few days ago, Sukarno beat his chest and shouted that he would never succumb to pressure from any side, 'I will never take a step back, not even a millimeter.' This sentence now seems to belong to the category of famous last words."
    The Associated Press reported when Suharto seized state power, saying, "President Sukarno's chances of a comeback are very slim. He is considered to be just a puppet." "If he honestly follows along, they will probably let him continue to be a puppet – a great old man in Indonesian politics. But if he engages in conspiracy activities again, then he will really be in trouble." The news agency also said: "Sukarno himself has been isolated from the public since March 18th. ... Sukarno is being held in the Bogor Palace, and only occasionally is he transported to the Jakarta Independence Palace for short stays to sign decrees and handle official business."

    印度尼西亚右派将领加紧勾结日本反动势力
    佐藤政府乘机大肆渗入印度尼西亚　日本反动军人参与反苏加诺活动
    华盛顿赞扬右派将领集团使苏加诺总统成为“一个傀儡”
    新华社七日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派将领集团在夺取国家政权以后，在投靠美国的同时，正加紧同日本佐藤政府勾结。
    据共同社报道：日本驻印度尼西亚大使斋藤在五日访问了印度尼西亚外长马利克，通知他日本政府决定给予印度尼西亚二百五十万美元的“紧急经济援助”。马利克对斋藤说，印度尼西亚准备派遣以第四副总理布沃诺为首的经济代表团访问日本，讨论加强“两国的合作关系”和新的经济援助计划。这个代表团将在本月底成行。美联社五日从雅加达也报道说，印度尼西亚这个“权力强大”的代表团不仅要去日本，“可能还去欧洲和美国”，“寻求迫切需要的外援”。代表团“此行将是苏哈托控制的新政府为印度尼西亚取得财政援助而作的一次重大努力”。
    据报道，印度尼西亚右派军人集团在九月三十日事件以后，已数度派“密使”去日本求援。他们中间的很多人，早在日本帝国主义过去占领印度尼西亚期间，同日本军国主义分子曾有过密切的关系。日本《现代周刊》不久前透露：在印度尼西亚形势发生急剧变化之后，曾经代表日本统治集团对印度尼西亚进行活动的川岛正次郎，已经为自由民主党极右派头子福田赳夫所代替，“训练过苏哈托及陆军中骨干分子”的日本旧军人集团内的一部分人，“参与了策划反苏加诺的秘密活动”。据报道，在九月三十日事件以来，日本已经向印度尼西亚右派将领集团提供了“紧急援助”四千七百万美元。
    为了讨好佐藤政府，印度尼西亚新政权改变了不参加由日本召开的所谓“东南亚开发部长会议”的态度，决定以“观察员”身份，同“马来西亚”、南越等傀儡集团坐在一起，乞求日本给予长期经济“援助”。
    苏哈托向日本求“援”的作法，正中佐藤政府的下怀。一贯追随美国并正在向东南亚加紧扩张的佐藤政府，抓住这个机会，正向印度尼西亚大举渗透。据日本报刊报道，佐藤政府在以苏哈托为中心的新政权成立以后，就决定加速准备对印度尼西亚提供“紧急援助”。
    新华社七日讯　美国报刊和通讯社在评论印度尼西亚局势时，毫不掩饰地赞扬右派将领集团夺取国家政权，并且使苏加诺总统成为一个有名无实的国家元首，成为他们手中的“一个傀儡”。
    《基督教科学箴言报》发表社论说：“陆军现在把他（苏加诺总统）降到有职无权的地位”。“现在看来权力已经明白无误地转入陆军手中。但是把苏加诺留在他的金丝笼中，这样可以用朋加诺的名义，使陆军的控制在目前印度尼西亚尚把一个人奉若神明的情况下，具有合法地位，并且用他的名义，来承担这个天富之国遭受经济困难的最后责任”。
    《华盛顿明星晚报》以《黯然失色的苏加诺》为题发表文章说：“苏哈托正在控制局面，苏加诺没有什么希望东山再起了。”文章说，“如果事实证明是这样的话，从西方的观点来看，这只能是一种值得欢迎的情况。”文章说，“几天前苏加诺捶胸大叫，他绝不向任何方面的压力屈服，‘我绝不后退一步甚至一毫米’。这句话现在似乎是属于著名的最后的话的一类了。”
    美联社报道苏哈托夺取国家权力时说，“苏加诺总统卷土重来的可能是很小的。人们认为，他只不过是一个傀儡。”“如果他老老实实地跟着走，他们大概会让他继续当傀儡——印度尼西亚政界中的一个伟大的老人。但是如果他再搞阴谋活动，那他就会真正遇到麻烦。”这家通讯社还说：“苏加诺本人自从三月十八日以来就与公众隔绝了。……苏加诺被看管在茂物宫，只是有时他被运送到雅加达独立宫作短时逗留，以签署法令和处理公务。”
