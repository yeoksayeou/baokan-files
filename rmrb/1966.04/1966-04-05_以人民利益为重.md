    Why must the county committee's "squad leader" promote a democratic style, and how can the Party's democratic centralism be genuinely implemented? Several county party secretaries from Shaanxi Province have shared their understanding and experiences.
    Taking the People's Interests as Paramount
    In recent years, especially since 1962, we have made some progress in implementing the Party's democratic centralism. The enthusiasm of Party members and cadres, and their sense of responsibility towards the Party's cause, have been greatly enhanced. However, compared to the requirements of the Party and Chairman Mao, and compared to Comrade Jiao Yulu, there are still many problems. As far as the county committee itself is concerned, there are problems with insufficient centralization, but a more common phenomenon is insufficient democracy. Although the Party committee meetings are still held, and issues are discussed collectively, the effect is not good because some comrades attending the meetings do not fully express their opinions. Resolutions made in this way are sometimes incomplete, sometimes contain significant one-sidedness or even errors. There are many reasons for this situation, including issues of understanding, methods, and style, but the most fundamental reason is the county party secretary's worldview. I do not have as good a democratic style as Comrade Jiao Yulu, who was good at listening to opinions from all sides. In the county committee meetings, he valued everyone's speech, listened attentively, and asked for clarification on important details. I am not like that. At county committee meetings, I am not so fond of listening to speeches that are verbose due to the speaker's limited level, and difficult to grasp the main points quickly, and I even hinder people from speaking. Sometimes, for certain opinions that I believe are incorrect, I am even less willing to listen patiently. This affects the enthusiasm of some comrades to express their opinions. Whether the Party's democratic centralism can be implemented well depends on whether the "squad leader" has a genuine democratic style. If the "squad leader's" style is undemocratic, no matter how many or how long the meetings are held, they will only be a formality. The so-called genuine democratic style is by no means an empty phrase; without a genuine proletarian mass viewpoint, without a thorough and complete worldview of serving the people, there can be no genuine democratic style. Comrade Jiao Yulu had precisely such a mass viewpoint and worldview, which enabled him to have a genuine democratic style. He created a democratic atmosphere with his exemplary actions, influencing and motivating others, making the meetings so good, so lively, where everyone expressed their opinions freely and discussed them repeatedly. This is something we should learn from. For the "squad leader," whether or not they can listen to opinions from all sides, especially dissenting and critical opinions, is a very important issue. On this point, one must prioritize the interests of the people, be capable of self-revolution and self-criticism, dare to uphold the truth, correct mistakes, and never have any personal selfish thoughts.
    To achieve this, the most fundamental thing is to study Chairman Mao's works well. In the past two years, county committee members have made greater progress in studying Chairman Mao's works, but they still haven't studied well enough, especially in applying what they've learned. We have realized that to solve the problem of democratic centralism, the most fundamental thing is to organize leading cadres at all levels to earnestly study Chairman Mao's works and arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought. This way, we will become active and conscious executors of the Party's democratic centralism.

    县委的“班长”为什么必须发扬民主作风，如何才能真正贯彻执行党的民主集中制？陕西省一些县委书记谈了自己的认识和体会。
    以人民利益为重
    这些年，特别是一九六二年以来，我们在执行党的民主集中制方面，有了一些进步。党员、干部的积极性和对党的事业的责任心，有了较大的提高。但是，与党和毛主席的要求，与焦裕禄同志比较，问题还很多。就县委本身说，有集中不够的问题，但比较普遍的现象是发扬民主不充分。党委会议虽然照样开了，问题虽然经过集体讨论，但因为一部分参加会议的同志没有充分发表意见，效果并不好。这样作出的决议，有时不完整，有时有比较大的片面性甚至错误。出现这种情况原因很多，有认识问题，有方法、作风问题，但是最根本的还是县委书记的世界观问题。我就没有焦裕禄同志那样好的民主作风，他善于倾听各方面的意见。在县委会议上，他对每个人的发言都很重视，全神贯注的听，而且要问清一些重要情节。我就不是这样，在县委会议上，对于那些因为受水平限制讲话比较罗索，不易一下使人得到要领的发言，我就不那么爱听，甚至阻碍人家发言。有时对于某些自以为不正确的意见，更不愿意耐心地听下去。这样就影响了一些同志发表意见的积极性。党的民主集中制，能不能很好实行起来，关键就在于“班长”有没有真正的民主作风。如果“班长”的作风不民主，会开得再多、再长也不过是虚有形式而已。所谓真正的民主作风，绝不是一句空话，没有一个真正的无产阶级的群众观点，没有一个彻底、完全为人民服务的世界观，就不可能有真正的民主作风。焦裕禄同志正是有了这样的群众观点和世界观，才有了真正的民主作风。他以自己的模范行动，造成了民主的气氛，影响和带动了别人，使会议开得那样好，那样生动活泼，各抒己见，自由地、反复地进行讨论。这是很值得我们学习的。作为“班长”来讲，能不能倾听各方面的意见，特别是那些反对的意见、批评的意见，是个十分重要的问题。在这一点上，必须以人民利益为重，能够自我革命，自我批评，敢于坚持真理，修正错误，绝不能有个人私心杂念。
    要作到这点，最根本的还是学好毛主席著作。近两年来，县委委员学习毛主席著作虽然有了较大进步，但是仍然学的不够好，特别是活学活用不够。我们体会：解决民主集中制的问题，最根本的还在于组织各级领导干部认真学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想把我们头脑武装起来。这样我们就会成为党的民主集中制积极的、自觉的执行者。
