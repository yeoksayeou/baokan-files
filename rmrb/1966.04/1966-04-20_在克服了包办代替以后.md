	"Barefoot dancing" cannot accomplish anything well.
	I became the Party Secretary of the Gonghe Commune in Neijiang County, Sichuan, in 1962. At the beginning, I had great determination. However, I was not clear about how a commune Party Secretary could do his job well ideologically. I felt that as the secretary, I was responsible for everything and had great power. At the same time, I thought I was highly skilled and capable and did not see the role of the committee members. The Party Committee did not have a regular meeting system. When meetings were held, I did most of the talking and rarely listened to the opinions of the committee members. Everything was arranged by me, and I personally had to handle it. Although the committee members were assigned tasks, they were not allowed to fully exercise their functions. As a result, the more I took over, the more I dared not let go. The more I dared not let go, the more I took over. I was very busy and tired, and the committee members had opinions about me.
	Because the roles of the Party Committee members and various organizations were not brought into play, and I was "barefoot dancing," busy with grasping production and taking on administrative affairs, I neglected the Party's own construction and the ideological and political work of the masses. When implementing the Party's policies, I often did not prioritize the Party members and then the non-Party members. Party member meetings were rarely held, and the management and education of Party members were rarely attended to. Most of the meetings were "one-size-fits-all meetings," where more was said about production and less about ideology. I myself had a wrong view that no matter how good the Party work and political work were, if production did not improve, it would all be empty. As long as production went up, no one would say that our commune was bad.
	In the short term, this seemed to get the work done and increase production. However, the enthusiasm of Party members, cadres, and the masses could not be sustained, and it brought serious consequences. The role of the Party Committee members could not be fully brought into play, which also affected the unity among the committee members. The activities of various mass organizations were poorly carried out, the militia work was not implemented, and it was difficult to implement policies and complete tasks.
	Through the Socialist Education Movement, the Commune Party Committee had a clearer understanding of the system of collective leadership and individual responsibility. The responsibilities of the Party Committee and the Management Committee, the secretary, and the committee members were divided, and a system of collective leadership and individual responsibility was established. Initially, although I handed over the administrative work, I was still a little worried that they would not do it well and that the higher authorities would criticize me. At the same time, I lacked confidence in strengthening the Party's own construction and ideological and political work. I felt that people's minds were constantly changing, and it was difficult to grasp. Later, through studying Chairman Mao's "Methods of Work of Party Committees" and "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work" and the political work experience of the People's Liberation Army, I clarified the direction, enhanced my confidence, and gradually turned my main energy to grasping the Party's own construction, ideological and political work, and implementing the Party's policies.

	Everyone gets involved, and all work becomes active.
	From the practice of this period of work, this approach has a very good effect.
	The collective leadership of the Party Committee has been strengthened, the work of the committee members has become more active, and the roles of the Management Committee and mass organizations have been brought into play. The Party Committee holds two regular Party Committee meetings every month. Before the meeting, I inform each committee member of the main content of the meeting so that they can prepare. At the meeting, democracy is promoted, and the committee members are allowed to fully express their opinions. Decisions are made according to the principle of the minority obeying the majority, and then they are carried out separately. I first take the lead in conscientiously implementing the Party Committee's decisions and supervise and inspect the work of each committee member. Therefore, each committee member is both concerned about the overall situation and can be bold and responsible. The Management Committee and the director actively lead production and handle day-to-day administrative affairs. Various mass organizations carry out activities around the central task, which not only ensures the completion of the central task, but also makes their work more active.
	Last August, it was necessary to rush the autumn harvest and carry out the work of new recruits. The tasks were heavy, and the time was tight. According to the previous working method, a "one-size-fits-all meeting" would be held to deploy and implement the work. Grasping the progress, collecting information, and other work were all handled by myself, without any system. This time, we convened a Commune Party Committee meeting to discuss and study the publicity and education, material preparation, labor organization, and leadership division of labor in the autumn harvest and recruitment work. After making a resolution, I convened a branch secretary meeting and a Party member meeting to convey and implement it. The director convened a meeting of cadres above the production team leader level to mobilize and deploy the work. In this way, various organizations carried out activities around this central task. The Communist Youth League and the militia organization educated young people and militiamen to be good shock workers in production and educated young people of the right age to actively sign up for military service. The women's organization educated women to arrange their housework, strive to work more, help the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers with washing clothes and bedding, and grinding flour, and do a good job in the ideological work of the families of soldiers. The Poor Peasants Association also actively assisted and supervised cadres in implementing policies and doing a good job. The work went very smoothly. The autumn harvest was completed in less than half a month, which was the earliest in the entire district. The recruitment work was also successfully completed.
	From this, I realized that relying on the collective leadership of the Party Committee and giving play to the role of various organizations, prioritizing the Party and then the non-Party, and the working method of launching at all levels is slower than the previous personal "barefoot dancing" and "one-size-fits-all" working methods, but in fact, the work is done more deeply and meticulously, and the tasks are completed faster and better.
	Now, I have more time and energy to grasp the implementation of the Party's policies and the ideological and political work inside and outside the Party. The Party's activities have been strengthened, and the ideological and political work has been strengthened, which has better promoted the development of collective production.

    在克服了包办代替以后
    四川内江县共和公社前党委书记　邓维扬
    “光杆跳舞”，事情是办不好的
    我是在一九六二年担任公社党委书记的。开始时，决心很大。但是，公社党委书记怎样才能做好工作，思想上是不够明确的。我感到当了书记要负责全盘，权力大，同时，认为自己水平高，能力强，看不到委员的作用。党委会没有定期的会议制度，开会也是我个人说得多，很少听取委员的意见。什么工作都听我安排，而且自己要亲自去抓。委员虽然分了工，但没有让他们充分行使职权。结果是我越包办代替，就越不敢放手，越不敢放手，就越包办得多。自己很忙很累，委员们对我还有意见。
    由于没有发挥党委委员和各种组织的作用，自己光杆跳舞，忙于抓生产和包揽行政事务，就忽视了党的自身建设和群众的思想政治工作。在贯彻党的方针政策的时候，常常不是先党内、后党外。党员会很少召开，党员的管理教育很少过问，多数是开“一揽子会”，会上讲生产多，讲思想少。我自己有个错误看法，认为党的工作和政治工作再好，生产上不去，还不是空的。只要生产上去了，那个还说我们这个公社不好。
    这样做，在短时间内，从表面上看，工作是抓起来了，生产也有提高。但是，党员、干部和群众的积极性不能持久，而且带来了严重的后果。党委委员的作用不能充分发挥，也影响了委员之间的团结。各种群众组织的活动开展差，民兵工作不落实，贯彻政策和完成任务都很吃力。
    经过社会主义教育运动，公社党委对集体领导和个人分工负责制度有了比较明确的认识，划分了党委和管委，书记和委员的职责范围，建立了集体领导和个人分工负责的制度。起初，我虽然把行政事务工作交出去了，但还是有些不放心，怕他们搞不好，上级要批评我。同时，我对于加强党的自身建设和思想政治工作缺乏信心，感到人的思想千变万化，不好抓。后来，通过学习毛主席《党委会的工作方法》、《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》等文章，和解放军的政治工作经验，才明确了方向，增强了信心，逐步把自己的主要精力转向抓党的自身建设、思想政治工作和贯彻执行党的方针政策上来。
    大家动手，各项工作活跃起来了
    从这一段的工作实践看，这样做效果很好。
    党委的集体领导加强了，委员的工作积极了，管委会和群众组织的作用发挥了。党委每月定期开两次党委会，会前，我将会议的主要内容，通知每个委员，以便他们作好准备，会上发扬民主，让委员充分发表意见，按少数服从多数的原则作出决议，然后分头去办。我首先以身作则，认真地执行党委的决议，并督促检查每个委员的工作。因此，每个委员既关心全局，又能大胆负责。管委会和社长积极领导生产和处理日常行政事务工作。各种群众组织都围绕中心开展工作，不但保证了中心工作的完成，而且它们的工作也活跃起来了。
    去年八月，既要突击秋收，又要搞新兵入伍工作，任务重，时间紧。按照过去的工作方法，就是召开“一揽子会”布置贯彻。掌握进度，收集情况等工作，都是自己眉毛胡子一把抓。这次我们召开了公社党委会，讨论研究秋收和入伍工作中的宣传教育，物资准备，劳力组织和领导分工；在作出决议以后，我召开支部书记会和党员大会传达贯彻，社长召开生产队长以上干部会动员布置。这样，各种组织都围绕这个中心开展了活动。共青团和民兵组织教育青年、民兵当好生产上的突击手，教育适龄青年积极报名入伍。妇女组织教育妇女安排好家务，争取多出工，帮助烈军属洗衣被、推磨，并做好参军家属的思想工作。贫协组织也积极协助和监督干部执行政策，做好工作。工作进行得很顺利。秋收不到半个月就收打完了，是全区完得最早的。入伍工作也胜利完成。
    由此我体会到：依靠党委集体领导、发挥各种组织作用，先党内、后党外，层层发动的工作方法，比过去个人光杆跳舞和一揽子工作方法，看起来工作似乎是慢了，但实际上工作做得更深更细致，任务完成得更快更好。
    现在，我有更多的时间和精力来抓贯彻党的方针政策和党内外的思想政治工作了。党的活动加强了，思想政治工作加强了，就更好地促进了集体生产的发展。
