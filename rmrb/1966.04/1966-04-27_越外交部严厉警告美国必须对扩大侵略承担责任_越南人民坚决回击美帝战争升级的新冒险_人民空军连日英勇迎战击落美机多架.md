    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 25th - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 25th regarding U.S. imperialism's intensification of the "escalation" of the war against North Vietnam, warning the U.S. government that it must bear full responsibility for all its war crimes.

    The statement said that recently, U.S. imperialism has been making every effort to intensify the bombing and strafing of the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. At the same time, U.S. imperialism continues to send troops to South Vietnam, increasing the U.S. expeditionary force and its puppet troops to more than 270,000.

    The statement said that while strengthening and expanding the above-mentioned war actions, U.S. imperialism also hypocritically rehashes the tune of "peace talks" in order to cover up the United States' strengthening of the bombing and strafing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, to cover up the inhumane actions of the United States in intensifying the destructive war in South Vietnam, to cover up the extremely serious situation of the Saigon puppet regime which is tottering, and at the same time to attempt to divert the attention of the world people who are resolutely condemning U.S. imperialist aggressors. U.S. imperialism has further exposed its extremely insidious aggressive and bellicose face!

    The statement said: "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sternly warns U.S. imperialism that its new adventurous actions of intensifying air raids against North Vietnam and intensifying aggression against South Vietnam will inevitably be resolutely counterattacked by the Vietnamese people. The U.S. government must bear full responsibility for all its war crimes."

    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam calls on the governments and peoples of socialist countries, the governments and peoples of all countries in the world who love peace and uphold justice, and the American people to strengthen the struggle and timely stop the clutches of the U.S. war criminals, and not allow them to commit new crimes against the Vietnamese people.

    The statement concluded: "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam firmly demands that the U.S. government must permanently and unconditionally stop the bombing, strafing and all other war actions against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; must stop the war of aggression against South Vietnam, must withdraw all its and its puppet countries' troops and weapons from South Vietnam; allow the Southern people to solve their own affairs; must respect and strictly implement the 1954 Geneva Agreements on the Vietnam issue."

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi - It was announced here on the 26th that the Air Force of the Vietnamese People's Army once again launched a heroic attack on the 26th, and in coordination with the military and civilians of Hebei Province, shot down two U.S. jet aircraft and damaged many others.

    According to supplementary news released here at noon on the 25th, the military and civilians of Thai Binh, Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Nam Ha and other provinces in northern Vietnam shot down seven U.S. bandit aircraft in the five days from the 19th to the 23rd.

    The military and civilians of Hebei Province, Bac Thai Province, Quang Binh Province and the People's Air Force of northern Vietnam shot down four intruding U.S. bandit aircraft on the afternoon of the 24th and captured U.S. pilots alive.

    According to additional reports, the military and civilians of Nghe An Province shot down one intruding U.S. aircraft and damaged several others on the 23rd.

    越外交部严厉警告美国必须对扩大侵略承担责任
    越南人民坚决回击美帝战争升级的新冒险
    人民空军连日英勇迎战击落美机多架
    新华社河内二十五日电越南民主共和国外交部二十五日就美帝国主义加紧对越南北方的战争“升级”发表声明，警告美国政府必须对它的一切战争罪行承担全部责任。
    声明说，最近，美帝国主义竭力加紧对越南民主共和国领土的轰炸和扫射，与此同时，美帝国主义仍然继续向越南南方增派军队，把美国远征军及其仆从国军队增加到二十七万名以上。
    声明说，美帝国主义在加强和扩大上述战争行动的同时，还假仁假义地重弹“和平讨论”的论调，以便掩盖美国加强对越南民主共和国的轰炸和扫射，掩盖美国加强对越南南方毁灭性战争的惨无人道的行动，掩盖西贡伪政权摇摇欲坠的极其严重的处境，同时企图转移正在坚决谴责美帝国主义侵略者的世界人民的视线。美帝国主义更加暴露了它的极其阴险的侵略和好战面目！
    声明说：“越南民主共和国外交部严厉警告美帝国主义：它的加强空袭越南北方以及加紧侵略越南南方的新的冒险行动，必将遭到越南人民的坚决回击。美国政府必须对它的一切战争罪行承担全部责任”。
    越南民主共和国外交部呼吁社会主义国家政府和人民，世界上爱好和平和主持正义的各国政府和人民以及美国人民，加强斗争，及时制止美国战争罪犯的魔爪，不让它们对越南人民再犯下新的罪行。
    声明最后说：“越南民主共和国外交部坚决要求美国政府必须永远和无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸、扫射和其他一切战争行动；必须停止对越南南方的侵略战争，必须把它的和仆从国家的军队和武器全部撤出越南南方；让南方人民自己解决自己的事务；必须尊重和严正履行一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议”。
    据新华社河内电　据这里二十六日公布，越南人民军空军二十六日再次英勇出击，配合河北省军民一举击落美国喷气式飞机两架，击伤多架。
    又据这里二十五日中午公布的补充消息说，越南北方太平、清化、义安、河静、南河等省军民，在十九日到二十三日的五天中击落美国强盗飞机七架。
    越南北方河北省、北太省、广平省军民和人民空军二十四日下午击落入侵的美国强盗飞机四架，活捉美国飞行员。
    另据补充报道，义安省军民二十三日击落入侵的美国飞机一架，击伤多架。
