	Can Revolutionaries Shake Hands and Make Peace with Enemies?
	Zhao Bencai, Soldier of a Certain Unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Student of the Playwriting Training Class of the Central Academy of Drama
	The movie "The Besieged City" (兵临城下, *Bing Lin Cheng Xia*) desperately promotes the theory of class reconciliation, painstakingly building a "bridge of friendship" between the enemy and ourselves that cannot exist in reality. It uses artistic means to vigorously exaggerate, attempting to deceive the masses into accepting it. This political deception must be exposed!
	There are several scenes in the film: Minister Jiang, a high-ranking cadre of our Northeast Democratic Allied Army, shook hands with a high-ranking officer of the Chiang bandits three times. Under what circumstances did these handshakes occur? And why did the author use close-up shots to portray them?
	The first handshake occurred after Zheng Hanchen, a regimental commander of the Chiang army, was captured by our army, refused to surrender, and openly provocatively stated, "Success or death." Minister Jiang not only failed to educate Zheng Hanchen with the serious political principles of our army but instead made concessions and compromises, abjectly saying "We won't force you to surrender," "We'll send you back," and so on. He proactively extended his hand to make peace, shaking the hand of Zheng Hanchen, stained with the blood of the people, and which still refused to lay down the butcher knife. Two large hands, indistinguishable between friend and foe, were tightly clasped together, and the boundary between the enemy and ourselves dissolved in that one handshake. This is a close-up of the first handshake, and also the first pillar of this "bridge of friendship."
	The matter does not end there. Minister Jiang took the initiative to shake the enemy's bloody hand for a second time. In order to plan the uprising of Zhao Chongwu, the commander of the 369th Division, the besieged enemy in the isolated city, Minister Jiang visited Zhao Chongwu in the enemy's den without being invited. During this meeting, Minister Jiang did not take advantage of the enemy's desperate situation and impending doom, guiding them and explaining the advantages and disadvantages, forcing them to revolt. Instead, he used the means of rekindling old friendships to beg Zhao Chongwu to accept his visit. He extended a warm hand to Zhao Chongwu, but Zhao Chongwu took a clear stand, completely ignoring this old friend, only seeing him as a Communist in the Democratic Allied Army. Thus, Zhao Chongwu withdrew his hand from Minister Jiang's hand. On the screen, we saw Minister Jiang's wishful thinking in extending his hand, a weak and pitiful hand, a hand that did not distinguish between friend and foe. This hand formed a profound satire of our Party and our army's work in disintegrating the enemy army. Repeated compromises and concessions did not seek friendship.
	However, Minister Jiang "did not dwell on old grievances." When Zhao Chongwu defeated his political enemy, Staff Officer Hu, and appeared before Minister Jiang with a victor's attitude, relying on the Democratic Allied Army, Minister Jiang hurriedly turned around and stepped forward to shake hands with Zhao Chongwu, who was wearing the uniform of a Kuomintang general. This handshake did not indicate acceptance of Zhao Chongwu's surrender, but rather gratitude to Zhao Chongwu for finally making great contributions to completing the "bridge of friendship" and "cooperation" between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang local army.
	Three instances of condescension, three instances of compromise, three instances of humility, finally using principles to complete the transaction of so-called "friendship."
	Chairman Mao said: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This question is of primary importance for the revolution." However, the movie "The Besieged City" (兵临城下, *Bing Lin Cheng Xia*) tries every possible means to build a "bridge of friendship" between the enemy and ourselves, blatantly promoting class reconciliation.
	Can revolutionaries "shake hands and make peace" with enemies? No! Absolutely not!

    革命者能和敌人握手言欢吗？
    中国人民解放军某部战士中央戏剧学院编剧进修班学员  赵本才
    电影《兵临城下》竭力宣扬了阶级调和论，费尽心机地在敌我之间搭起一座现实中根本不能存在的“友谊的桥梁”，借艺术手段大肆渲染，企图骗取人民群众的承认。这种政治性的欺骗，必须拆穿！
    影片中有这么几个镜头：我东北民主联军的高级干部姜部长，曾三次和蒋匪的高级军官握手。这些握手是在什么情况下发生的呢？作者又为什么要用特写镜头去表现它呢？
    第一次握手，是蒋军团长郑汉臣被我军俘获，拒不投降，公开挑衅地表示“不成功便成仁”之后。姜部长不仅不以我军严肃的政治原则教育郑汉臣，反而一味退让和迁就，低三下四地表示“不强迫你投降”“送你回去”等等。他主动言和地伸出自己的手，握住了郑汉臣那只沾满人民鲜血、而今仍不肯放下屠刀的手。两只不分敌我的大手紧紧地握在一起了，敌我的界限在一握之中消溶了。这是第一次握手的特写，也是这座“友谊桥梁”的第一个桥墩。
    事情还不止于此。姜部长又主动地第二次去握敌人的血手。姜部长为了策划孤城守敌三六九师师长赵崇武起义，不请自去地身入狼窝去会见赵崇武。这次的会见，姜部长不是在敌军山穷水尽走投无路的现实下，因势利导，晓以利害，迫使其起义，而是以故友身份，用重温旧好的手段乞求赵崇武容纳他的拜访。他向赵崇武伸出了热情的手，而赵崇武却是立场鲜明的，完全无视这位故友，只看到他是民主联军中的共产党人，于是从姜部长的手中抽回了自己的手。银幕上我们看到的是姜部长一厢情愿所伸出的手，一只文弱可怜的手，敌我不分的手，这只手形成了对我党我军瓦解敌军工作的刻骨的讽刺。一再的妥协迁就并没有寻求到友谊。
    但是姜部长“不念旧恶”，当赵崇武战胜了他的政敌胡高参，依靠民主联军，以胜利者的态度出现在姜部长面前的时候，姜部长又赶忙转身向前，与身着国民党将官制服的赵崇武主动握手。这握手不是表明接受赵崇武的投诚，而是感谢赵崇武终于为完成“友谊的桥梁”，为共产党和国民党地方军的“合作”立下了汗马功劳。
    三次屈就，三次妥协，三次谦卑，终于用原则完成了对所谓“友谊”的交易。
    毛主席说：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”可是电影《兵临城下》却千方百计在敌我之间搭起“友谊的桥梁”，露骨地宣扬阶级调和。
    革命者能和敌人“握手言欢”吗？不！决不能！
