　　Suppress the Evil Winds and Noxious Influences
　　Worker of Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 6, Cai Fengying

　　In Wu Han’s “Hai Rui Dismissed from Office,” he says that Hai Rui was willing to give up his official position to seek justice for the people. This is nonsense. Officials in feudal society were slaves appointed by the emperor. If they didn't think of the emperor and instead spoke for the laboring people, wouldn't the emperor have their heads chopped off? I want to expose his lies. In my own family, my father was forced to flee to Shanghai because the landlord drove him to desperation; my grandmother took her children to Zhenjiang to work as a servant for a landlord’s family. One day, while working, a bamboo splinter pierced her eye, even gouging out the eyeball. Not only did the landlord not provide medical treatment, but he immediately kicked her out. As a result, my grandmother lost one eye. Who spoke for her and reasoned with her in the old society? I myself started working at the Rihua Yarn Factory at the age of fifteen, and the abuse and beatings I suffered are too numerous to recount. It was common for the “Number One” [Na Mo Wen, a factory boss or foreman in Shanghai dialect] to grab hair and bang heads against the wall. Even now, after so many years, my nose still bleeds often, the old injury from those beatings. Since liberation, every time my nose bleeds, it reminds me of the countless sufferings I endured in the old society and makes me even more grateful for the happiness that the Party and Chairman Mao have won for us. My experience is living proof that there were no "good officials" in the old society!
　　Under the dark reactionary rule, which laboring family didn't have deep-seated hatred and grievances? The Communist Party and Chairman Mao led us in struggle, overthrew the three great mountains, and resolutely carried out the socialist revolution. Only then did we forever escape oppression and exploitation. This is the only hope and the only way out for the laboring people. If you want to talk about working for the people, it can only be the cadres educated by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Just look at Comrade Jiao Yulu, Chairman Mao’s good student! He couldn't eat or sleep in order to overcome the disasters in Lankao, giving his all until his death. And look at Lei Feng and Wang Jie! The Party and Chairman Mao have cultivated so many good cadres and fighters who wholeheartedly and thoroughly serve the people. Why doesn't Wu Han open his eyes and look at these facts? Instead, he wants everyone to learn from Hai Rui, the running dog of feudal landlords, and wants to insinuate and attack the Communist Party. Why did you have to write "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" in 1960? What were you trying to do? All this proves that Wu Han is engaged in covert class struggle. He is not attacking the Party openly with swords and spears, but is using words to play tricks and spread poison, clearing the way for the restoration of the bourgeoisie. We workers must use Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon to completely shatter this conspiracy and suppress the evil winds and noxious influences.

    把歪风邪气压下去
    上海国棉六厂工人　蔡凤英
    吴晗在《海瑞罢官》中，讲海瑞为了替百姓伸冤，连官也可以不做。这是鬼话。封建社会的官，是皇帝封的奴才，如果他不为皇帝着想而替劳动人民讲话，皇帝不杀他的头才怪呢？我就要拆穿他的谎话。我自己家里，父亲是被地主迫得没有办法才逃到上海来的；我祖母带了孩子逃到镇江给一家地主帮佣，有天做生活时竹枝刺进眼睛，连眼珠也给挑了出来。地主不但不替她医治，反而立时把她赶了出来，祖母就此瞎了一只眼睛，在旧社会里有谁替她说话讲理？我自己十五岁起进日华纱厂做工，受气挨打简直几天几夜说不完。“拿摩温”揪头发撞墙头是常事，至今多少年了，鼻子还常常出血，就是当年打下的老伤，解放以来，每次鼻子出血，都叫我想起旧社会吃的数不尽的苦，更感谢党和毛主席给我们争来的幸福。我的经历，就是旧社会没有“好官”的活见证！
    在不见天日的反动统治下，哪一家劳动人民没有深仇大恨、没有海底沉冤。共产党、毛主席领导我们斗争，推翻三座大山，坚决进行社会主义革命，我们才永远摆脱了压迫和剥削，这是劳动人民的唯一希望、唯一出路。要说为人民、为百姓，那只有共产党、毛主席教育出来的干部。请看看毛主席的好学生焦裕禄同志！他为战胜兰考灾害吃不下、睡不着，鞠躬尽瘁、死而后已。再看看雷锋、王杰，党和毛主席给我们培养了这么多全心全意彻底为人民服务的好干部好战士，吴晗为什么不张开眼睛看看这些事实，反而叫大家学习封建地主的走狗海瑞，反而要影射攻击共产党。你不迟不早偏偏要在一九六○年写《海瑞罢官》，又是为了什么？这一切都证明了吴晗就是在搞隐蔽的阶级斗争。他不是明刀明枪地向党进攻，而是利用文字耍花枪放毒，为资产阶级复辟鸣锣开道。我们工人一定要以毛泽东思想作武器，彻底粉碎这个阴谋。把歪风邪气压下去。
