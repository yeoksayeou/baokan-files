    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 15th Dispatch: Jakarta news: The head of Indonesia's right-wing generals' clique, Nasution, recently delivered three consecutive speeches in Jakarta, clamoring to strengthen white terror and continue to "cleanse" Indonesian state organs, the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly, and the Cooperative Parliament, in order to transform these institutions into tools used by the right-wing generals' clique.
    According to a Jakarta radio broadcast on the 13th, Nasution addressed a group of right-wing university students on the 12th, feeling quite pleased about the right-wing generals' clique's recent establishment of an anti-communist cabinet and the reactionary measures to "dissolve" the Indonesian Communist Party. He said, "The Indonesian Communist Party has been dissolved, and the cabinet has been reorganized." However, Nasution was not satisfied with this, saying, "This only amounts to ten to twenty percent." He clamored for continued "cleansing" of state organs. He said, "The Indonesian Communist Party has been dissolved, but the next steps have not yet been completed." "The work of cleansing the September 30th elements from revolutionary institutions, especially overseas agencies, has not been completed."
    According to an Antara News Agency report on the 11th, Nasution, in another recent speech, again clamored for a "thorough cleansing" of the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly and the Cooperative Parliament. He said, "The call for a thorough cleansing of the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly and the Cooperative Parliament and for perfecting them is justified. After the cleansing, these two institutions should convene meetings in accordance with the spirit and content of the 1945 Constitution."
    On the 13th, when receiving representatives from the reactionary "Indonesian University Students United Action Organization" stationed in Yogyakarta, Nasution also incited this reactionary organization to "eliminate" the "impediments of the 1945 generation" who participated in the struggle for national independence in those years.

    印尼右派要把合作国会等变为御用工具
    纳苏蒂安叫嚷要“彻底清洗”国家机构
    新华社十五日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派将领集团的头目纳苏蒂安最近在雅加达接连发表三次讲话，叫嚷要加强白色恐怖，继续“清洗”印度尼西亚的国家机构、临时人民协商会议和合作国会，以便把这些机构变成右派将领集团御用的工具。
    据雅加达电台十三日广播，纳苏蒂安十二日对一批右派大学生发表讲话，对右派将领集团最近成立反共内阁和
  “解散”印度尼西亚共产党的反动措施颇为得意。他说：“印度尼西亚共产党已经解散了，内阁也已经改组了”。但是，纳苏蒂安对这些还并不满足，他说，“这不过只达到百分之十到二十”。他叫嚷要继续“清洗”国家机构。他说：“已经把印度尼西亚共产党解散了，但是下一步的工作到现在还没有完成”。“革命机构，特别是驻外机构清洗九月三十日分子的工作还没有完成”。
    据安塔拉通讯社十一日报道，纳苏蒂安在最近的另一次讲话中再次叫嚷“彻底清洗”临时人民协商会议和合作国会。他说：“要求彻底清洗临时人民协商会议和合作国会并使它们完美化的意见是正当的。在清洗后，这两个机构应当按着一九四五年宪法的精神和内容召开会议”。
    纳苏蒂安十三日在接见反动的“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动组织”驻日惹的代表时，还鼓动这个反动组织“排除”当年参加争取民族独立斗争的“一九四五年一代的阻滞”。
