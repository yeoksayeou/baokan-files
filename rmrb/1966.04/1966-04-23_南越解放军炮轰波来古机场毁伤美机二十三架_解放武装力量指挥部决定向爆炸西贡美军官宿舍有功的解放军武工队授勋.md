    Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd: Saigon dispatch: The South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces used intense mortar fire in the early hours of April 22nd to shell a new airport in Pleiku, in the central highlands, used by the U.S. invading forces.
    According to an Agence France-Presse report, twenty-three aircraft were destroyed or damaged, and the U.S.-puppet troops stationed there also suffered casualties. Just two days prior, in the early hours of April 20th, the Liberation Armed Forces attacked the airport at the An Khe base of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division near Pleiku, destroying and damaging some aircraft.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 21st: According to a report by the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces Command recently decided to award the Saigon-Gia Dinh area Liberation Army guerrilla unit that raided the Victoria Hotel in Saigon with the Third-Class Liberation Army Medal of Merit, in recognition of the achievements they made in this battle.
    The report said that in the battle to attack and bomb the U.S. military barracks, the Victoria Hotel in Saigon, in the early morning of April 1st, the Liberation Army killed and wounded 215 U.S. Navy, Army, and Air Force officers, including 94 killed and 121 wounded. All the U.S. officers living on the bottom five floors of this ten-story building were killed, and the U.S. officers living on the top five floors were also injured by the impact of the bomb explosion and the collapse of the building. After these injured U.S. military officers were sent to the hospital, by April 5th, two had died, and seventeen were on the verge of death.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 22nd: According to a report by the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, in the first half of April, guerrillas in Nha Be District, Hoc Mon District, and Cu Chi District of Gia Dinh Province in South Vietnam, in their anti-"sweeping" operations, annihilated 207 enemies, including more than 30 U.S. invading soldiers, destroyed and damaged 18 enemy armored vehicles, shot down or damaged 3 helicopters, and sank one landing craft.
    On April 2nd, U.S. bandits and their running dogs concentrated their forces to invade Phong Duc village, Nha Be District, near Saigon. The local guerrillas relied on fortified combat villages to repel twelve enemy attacks, annihilating 117 enemies. The remaining enemies fled in panic.
    On April 5th, the U.S.-puppet clique dispatched another main force battalion of puppet troops and a large number of security teams and civil defense teams to conduct a "sweep" of the third village of Binh My commune, Hoc Mon District. Guerrilla fighters, regardless of the enemy's aircraft and artillery bombardment, stubbornly counterattacked the enemy, killing 60 enemies, sinking one landing craft, and shooting down or damaging three helicopters.
