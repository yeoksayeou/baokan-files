    According to a dispatch from Jakarta by Xinhua News Agency on the 25th: The *Washington Post* published two articles on April 17th and 18th by its reporter, Stanley Karnow, after a two-week interview in East Java, Central Java, and Bali, revealing some new horrifying facts about the fascist massacre being carried out by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces.

    The article said: “One night in the city of Salatiga, two army trucks rumbled through the streets, stopping briefly at four dilapidated buildings, all of which had been requisitioned to hold the thousands of suspected communists in custody.” “At each building, an army captain read a list, notifying them of their so-called crimes ‘in the name of the law,’ although no trials had ever been held. Finally, the trucks loaded sixty prisoners and, escorted by a row of soldiers, drove six miles through the pitch-black rice paddies and rubber plantations to a desolate spot near the village of Tjelok. Farmers nearby had dug a large pit the day before on the orders of the village head. The prisoners were lined up on the edge of the pit and, within minutes, were shot down. But my informant believes some were buried alive.”

    “Near the ancient Hindu temple town of Prambanan, the town head took me to the banks of the Worro River. He informally revealed that three thousand bodies lay under the sandy riverbed of this river.”

    “Temporary prisons in Central Java remain packed with communist prisoners. In Yogyakarta, they are crammed into the building that used to house the Thomas Jefferson Library of the United States Information Service.”

    “Prisons in East Java are emptier because fewer prisoners are spared. In this region, the military commander turns a blind eye to the black-shirted Ansor Youth Movement, a branch of the Islamic Teachers Association – a ‘quiet army’. The prisoners, with their thumbs tied behind their backs, are transported by army trucks to the villages. The (Ansor) Youth Movement takes on the task of killing them. According to a Muslim leader, 250,000 people were massacred in East Java alone. Here, the main tools used for execution are long sugarcane knives and sickles. … In several places, the killers held banquets in front of the bound prisoners they were about to kill. After the banquet, each guest was invited to behead a prisoner. As the massacre intensified throughout November, heads were hung on bridges,…rafts carried headless corpses downstream. The British Consul in Surabaya discovered four bodies washed ashore on the banks of the river near his beloved garden. In one area, so many corpses from Kediri filled the Brantas River that the town of Jombang downstream lodged a formal protest, complaining that it could cause a plague.”

    “Bali, with only two million inhabitants, had the highest percentage of those massacred in all of Indonesia. At least 50,000 people were killed here, a large proportion of whom were killed for mysterious reasons.” “Many of the victims were not communists at all, but merely enterprising Chinese and Javanese who had managed to open or own enviable shops and land. … (Subsequently) much of their property fell into the hands of local military officers and politicians.”

    印尼反动派罪恶滔天血债累累
    美报继续透露他们血腥大屠杀的罪行
    据新华社二十五日讯雅加达消息：《华盛顿邮报》在四月十七日和十八日刊登了这家报纸的记者斯坦利·卡诺在东爪哇、中爪哇和巴厘岛等地采访了两个星期后所写的两篇文章，透露了印度尼西亚右派反动势力继续进行法西斯大屠杀的一些新的骇人听闻的事实。
    文章说：“一天晚上，在沙拉笛拉城，两辆陆军卡车隆隆地驶过街道，在四座破旧的建筑物旁停了一会儿，这些建筑物都是被征用来收容在押的成千名共产党嫌疑分子的。”“在每一座建筑物旁，都有一名陆军上尉宣读了一分名单，‘以法律的名义’通知他们所谓犯了什么罪，虽然从未举行过任何审讯。最后，这些卡车装了六十名犯人，由一排军队押送，经过漆黑的稻田和橡胶园，行驶了六英里，来到策洛克村附近的一个荒凉的地方。附近的农民在前一天奉村长的命令挖了一个大坑。这些犯人排列在坑的边缘上，在几分钟之内就都被枪弹打倒了。但向我提供消息的人认为有一些人是被活埋的。”
    “在古老的印度教寺院所在的巴兰班南镇附近，镇长把我带到沃罗河边。他非正式的透露，在这条河的砂质河床下躺着三千具尸体。”
    “中爪哇的临时监狱仍然挤满了共产党犯人。在日惹，他们被塞到以前是美国新闻处托马斯·杰斐逊图书馆所在的那座大楼里去了。”
    “东爪哇的监狱比较空，因为被饶掉一命的犯人更少一些。在这个地区，军事司令对伊斯兰教师联合会的穿黑衬衫的安索青年团这一支‘静悄悄的军队’放纵不管。犯人们双手拇指反绑着，被陆军用卡车运到村子里。（安索）青年团担任杀死他们的任务。据一位穆斯林领导人说，仅在东爪哇一地，就有二十五万人被屠杀。在这里，用以处决的主要工具是长长的砍甘蔗刀和镰刀。……在几个地方，杀人者当着被捆绑着的要被他们杀掉的人的面，举行宴会。宴会后，请每一位客人斩下一名犯人的首级。在整个十一月份屠杀加紧进行的时候，桥上悬挂着首级，……木筏装运着无头尸体顺流而下。英国驻泗水领事在靠近他心爱的花园的河岸发现了四具被冲上岸的尸体。有一个地方，从谏义里流来的许多尸体塞满了布兰塔斯河，以致下游的宗班镇提出了正式抗议，抱怨说可能引起瘟疫。”
      “巴厘岛只有二百万居民，而在全印尼，它的被屠杀的人数的百分比是最高的。这里至少有五万人被杀死，这些人中有很大一部分是因神秘莫测的原因被杀的。”“受害者有许多人都不是什么共产党人，只不过是好容易开设着或拥有了令人羡慕的商店和土地、有事业心的华人和爪哇人。……（随后）他们的许多财产都落到当地军官和政客的手里了。”
