　　In "Encirclement" Growing Stronger
　　Recently, the patriotic people's armed forces of Thailand have repeatedly crushed the "encirclements" launched by U.S. imperialism and the Thai Thanom reactionary clique in the northeast, achieving great victories. This proves that the revolutionary people, when they take up arms to fight, will certainly be able to defeat enemies armed to the teeth.
　　"A single spark can start a prairie fire" is the universal law of the development of revolutionary struggles of oppressed nations and oppressed people. The single spark has to go through repeated struggles with imperialism and reactionaries before it can develop into a prairie fire. Imperialism and reactionaries always try to use force to eliminate the armed forces of the revolutionary people, launching one "encirclement" after another against them. However, the armed forces of the revolutionary people are precisely constantly preserving themselves, eliminating the enemy, accumulating experience, gaining training, and gradually growing stronger in the battles against "encirclement". In the distant past, there is the example of China; in the recent past, there is the example of South Vietnam. The Thai patriotic people's armed forces are also experiencing this process of growing in battle. One thing is completely certain: the more the Thai patriotic people's armed forces are "encircled," the more numerous they will become, and the more "encircled," the stronger they will become.
　　U.S. imperialism and the Thai reactionaries are stepping up their suppression of the patriotic forces in Thailand in order to prevent Thailand from becoming "the second South Vietnam," that is to say, to extinguish the revolutionary struggle of the Thai people. In fact, this approach of U.S. imperialism and the Thai reactionaries is precisely making Thailand turn into "the second South Vietnam" more quickly, that is to say, it is promoting the revolutionary flames of the Thai people to burn more fiercely.

    在“围剿”中壮大
    最近一个时期以来，泰国爱国人民武装在东北部一再粉碎了美帝国主义和泰国他侬反动集团发动的“围剿”，取得了很大的胜利。这证明了，革命人民拿起武器进行斗争，就一定能够战胜武装到牙齿的敌人。
      “星星之火，可以燎原”，这是被压迫民族和被压迫人民革命斗争发展的普遍规律。星星之火，是要经过同帝国主义和反动派的反复斗争，然后发展成为燎原的大火的。帝国主义和反动派总是企图用武力来消灭革命人民的武装力量，对它发动一次又一次“围剿”。而革命人民的武装力量却正是不断在反“围剿”的战斗中，保存自己，消灭敌人，积累经验，取得锻炼，逐渐壮大起来的。远的，有中国的例子；近的，有南越的例子。泰国爱国人民武装，也正是经历着这种在战斗中成长的历程。有一点是完全可以肯定的：泰国爱国人民的武装力量必然愈“剿”愈多，愈“剿”愈强。
    美帝国主义和泰国反动派加紧镇压泰国的爱国力量，是为了要防止泰国变成为“第二个南越”，也就是说，想把泰国人民的革命斗争扑灭下去。事实上，美帝国主义和泰国反动派的这种做法，恰恰是使得泰国更快地变成为“第二个南越”，也就是说，促使泰国人民的革命烽火更加炽烈地燃烧起来。
