    Xinhua News Agency, 12th. U.S. military aircraft recently bombed and strafed our fishing boats on the high seas again, killing two of our fishermen, wounding fifteen, and damaging three fishing boats. Relevant departments in our country express their strongest protest against this piratical act of U.S. imperialism.
    According to reports from fishermen who were attacked by U.S. aircraft: On the morning of April 7th, fishing boat No. 0061 of the Bada Zhe First Fishery Production Team of the Caotan Commune in Suixi County, Guangdong Province, was fishing in the Beibu Gulf on the high seas. At 9:30 a.m., two U.S. military aircraft suddenly attacked our fishing boat, frantically bombing and strafing, killing our fisherman Liu Zhichao and wounding four other fishermen. The mast of this fishing boat was bombed off, and the hull was damaged in many places. On the same afternoon, fishing boat No. 6002 of the Qishui Commune Fishery Brigade in Haikang County, Guangdong Province, and fishing boat No. 1012 of the Yuanfa Brigade of the Jianghong Commune in Suixi County, were also brutally attacked by U.S. aircraft while fishing on the high seas in the Beibu Gulf. At 3:30 p.m., two U.S. military aircraft sneaked into the airspace above the fishing grounds from the southwest, dropping six bombs on these two fishing boats and strafing them with machine guns in turns, immediately killing our fisherman Xian Yasan and wounding ten other fishermen. Our No. 1012 fishing boat of the Jianghong Commune was damaged, and the national flag of our country hanging on the boat was also broken. Our No. 6002 fishing boat of the Qishui Commune was hit with fifteen holes, and a large amount of seawater leaked into the cabin.
    In addition, our merchant ship "Nanhai No. 156" was subjected to two low-altitude dive provocations by a U.S. military aircraft while carrying out normal navigation in the sea area northeast of Hainan Island, Guangdong Province, from 9:55 to 9:57 on April 10th. The U.S. bandit aircraft rushed straight to only tens of meters above our merchant ship, endangering the lives and safety of our crew members.
    The U.S. Johnson administration has repeatedly dispatched military aircraft to disrupt fishery production and maritime navigation on the high seas, causing casualties and property losses to our personnel, which has aroused great indignation among the Chinese people. The responsible person of relevant departments in our country solemnly warns the U.S. government: Debts must be repaid. The aggressive activities of U.S. imperialism will surely be punished.

    美机袭击我渔船打死打伤我渔民多人
    我最强烈抗议美帝国主义的海盗行径
    新华社十二日讯　美国军用飞机最近又在公海上轰炸扫射我渔船，打死我渔民二人，打伤十五人，打坏渔船三艘。我国有关部门对美帝国主义这种海盗行径，表示最强烈的抗议。
    据受到美机袭击的渔民回来报告：四月七日上午，我广东省遂溪县草潭公社巴大蔗第一渔业生产队零零六一号渔船一艘，在北部湾公海捕鱼。九时三十分，美国军用飞机两架突然向我这艘渔船袭击，猖狂轰炸扫射，打死我渔民刘志超，并打伤我另外四名渔民。这艘渔船的桅杆被炸断，船身多处被打坏。同日下午，我广东省海康县企水公社渔业大队六零零二号渔船一艘，遂溪县江洪公社园发大队一零一二号渔船一艘，也在北部湾公海上捕鱼时，遭到美机的野蛮攻击。十五时三十分，美国军用飞机两架从西南方向窜进渔场上空，向这两艘渔船投掷炸弹六枚，并用机枪轮番扫射，当即打死我渔民冼亚山，并打伤我另外十一名渔民。我江洪公社的一零一二号渔船被打坏，船上悬挂的我国国旗也被打破。我企水公社的六零零二号渔船被打了十五个洞，大量海水漏进船舱。
    此外，我国商船“南海一五六号”轮，于四月十日九时五十五分至五十七分，在我广东省海南岛东北方向海域进行正常航行时，遭到美国军用飞机一架两次低空俯冲挑衅。美国强盗飞机直冲到距我商船上空仅数十米，使我船员的生命安全受到威胁。
    美国约翰逊政府一再派遣军用飞机破坏公海渔业生产和海上航行，使我人员受到伤亡，财产受到损失，激起了中国人民的极大愤慨。我国有关部门负责人严正警告美国政府：欠债必须偿还。美帝国主义的侵略活动是一定要受到惩罚的。
