    "Battleship Under Siege" promotes the theory of class reconciliation.
    Qi Zhenhuan, Zuo Shaoren, Workers of Beijing Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory

    The film "Battleship Under Siege" propagates that the contradiction between the enemy's direct line troops and the miscellaneous troops is irreconcilable. On the contrary, the contradiction between the People's Liberation Army and the miscellaneous troops can be reconciled. This completely obliterates class contradictions and class struggle. This is extremely wrong.

    First of all, regardless of whether they are direct line troops or non-direct line troops, their guns are pointed at the people: whether it is Chief of Staff Hu or Zhao Chongwu, they are both big executioners with blood on their hands, and they have climbed to high positions by relying on anti-communism and anti-people activities. In terms of class essence, direct line troops and non-direct line troops are birds of a feather, with no essential difference. The filmmakers portray the internal contradictions of direct line troops and non-direct line troops as irreconcilable, which is actually dividing the enemy into "good people" and "bad people," wanting people to find "good people" and "enlightened factions" among the enemy. This is the same as Wu Han wanting people to find "upright officials" among the feudal bureaucrats, and both are deceiving the people.

    Secondly, there are contradictions among the enemies, but these are just dog-eat-dog contradictions. We can use these contradictions, but we cannot rely on them. Eliminating the enemy or winning over the enemy to revolt and surrender must be based on armed struggle. The strong military power of our army and the vigorous support of the people are the keys to our victory. However, the film believes that the internal contradictions of the enemy are the key to promoting the enemy's surrender and the decisive factor in pushing Zhao Chongwu and others to the people's side. Zhao Chongwu and others seem not to be our enemies, but our friends, which is a serious blurring of the line between the enemy and us.

    Thirdly, taking our army's political work as an example, Minister Jiang did not explain the general principles, explain policies, or point out the way forward to Zhao Chongwu and others. Instead, he pulled and tugged, talked about personal feelings, and tried to establish relationships. It seems that personal feelings can change the class essence of the enemy. When Minister Jiang talked to Zheng Hanchen about finding Zheng's child, he said, "As long as you trust us," which doesn't sound like opposing classes at all, but like friends. When Minister Jiang entered the city to meet Zhao Chongwu, he constantly called him "Brother Chongwu," first reminiscing about the past and then discussing poetry and painting... Minister Jiang doesn't look like a veteran cadre at all, but like a scholar. This is a distortion of the party's political work cadres and also replaces the class viewpoint with the theory of human nature.

    《兵临城下》宣扬了阶级调和论
    北京长辛店机车车辆工厂工人　齐振环、左绍仁
    电影《兵临城下》宣传敌军嫡系部队与杂牌军之间的矛盾是不可调和的，相反，解放军与杂牌军之间的矛盾倒是可以调和的。这样就完全抹煞了阶级矛盾、阶级斗争。这是十分错误的。
    首先不管嫡系部队还是非嫡系部队，他们的枪口都是朝着人民的：不管是胡高参还是赵崇武，都是双手沾满人民鲜血的大刽子手，都是依靠反共反人民爬上高位的。从阶级实质上说，嫡系部队与非嫡系部队是一丘之貉，没有本质的区别。影片编导者把嫡系部队与非嫡系部队的内部矛盾写成不可调和的样子，实际上是把敌人分成“好人”和“坏人”，要人们在敌人里面找“好人”，找“明智派”，这和吴晗要人们在封建官僚里面找“清官”是同样的，都是在欺骗人民。
    其次，敌人之间是有矛盾的，但这不过是狗咬狗的矛盾，我们可以利用这些矛盾，但不能依赖这些矛盾。要消灭敌人或争取敌人起义投降，都必须建立在武装斗争的基础上，我军的强大军事力量和人民群众的大力支援，是我们取得胜利的关键。而影片中却认为敌人内部矛盾是促成敌人投降的关键，是把赵崇武等推向人民一边的决定因素。赵崇武他们好象不是我们的敌人，而是我们的朋友，这是严重的敌我不分。
    再次，拿我军的政治工作来说，姜部长对赵崇武等也不是晓以大义，交代政策，指明出路。而是拉拉扯扯，讲人情，套关系。好象通过人情就可以改变敌人的阶级本质。姜部长与郑汉臣谈到寻找郑的孩子时说：“只要你信得过我们”，根本不象是敌对的阶级，倒象是朋友。姜部长进城会见赵崇武，“崇武兄”“崇武兄”的不离口，先是忆旧情，念故交，接着诵诗论画……。姜部长完全不象个老干部，倒象个书生。这是对党的政治工作干部的歪曲，也是以人性论代替了阶级观点。
