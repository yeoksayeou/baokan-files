    Lively Thoughts Active in Newspapers Across the Country
    The More Selfless the Masses, the More Concerned the Leadership
    The soldiers of the Fourth Squad of the Second Company of a certain artillery unit knew that the camp's feed room could not be built due to a lack of tiles. They collected 160 yuan to buy a cart of tiles and sent them over. The Party Branch Committee of the Second Company studied this good deed and believed that this spirit of caring for the collective should be commended. However, the soldiers did not have much in the way of subsidies, and too much donation would cause difficulties in their daily lives, so it was not appropriate to promote this. They did not simply commend the matter and leave it at that, nor did they simply stop it. Instead, they used this matter to inspire everyone to implement the good idea of caring for the collective into their daily work and actions.
    The *Liberation Army Daily* published a short article in its "One Thing, One Discussion" column, saying that such good deeds and good ideas should of course be greatly commended. However, the Second Company considered more aspects. The soldiers' spirit of loving the collective is good. Our revolutionary soldiers always put the interests of the collective and the interests of the revolution first. For the cause of revolution, they can contribute their lives without hesitation, let alone a few pennies! However, from the leadership's point of view, a comprehensive consideration is needed. Taking out all savings would affect the soldiers' necessities of life. At the same time, the most important thing about being selfless is not expressed here. Emphasizing public interest does not mean negating private interest. Opposing individualism does not mean not caring about personal interests. Guaranteeing reasonable personal interests is also necessary for developing collective endeavors. The more consciously the masses are "selfless" for the cause of revolution, the more the leadership should care about them.
    Since it is not appropriate to promote donating money to buy tiles, then wouldn't it be enough to stop it? The Second Company did not do this either. Because the masses' spirit of caring for the collective is good, wouldn't a simple stop be pouring cold water on the enthusiasm of the masses? They adopted the method of persuasion and education and guidance. On the one hand, they explained the reasoning and returned the money; on the other hand, they mobilized everyone to find waste bricks and tiles and helped everyone complete the good deed. In this way, not only was the enthusiasm of the masses protected and good ideas promoted, but also the idea of doing good deeds was guided to more active aspects and elevated to a higher level.
    Learning the Learning of Advanced Experiences
    Zhanglou Brigade of Anxing Commune in Heze County used "wooden plates" in the past when digging wells. This time, they learned from the experience of Guozhuang Brigade and changed to using "brick plates." The wellbore was extremely unstable during the descent, seriously affecting the quality of the project. Zhang Deng'ai, the Party Branch Secretary of the brigade, visited Zhang Zhaoxing, an old poor peasant who was an "expert" in well digging, and asked him if "wooden plates" were better than "brick plates." Zhang Zhaoxing said: "When learning from others, you have to see if it's appropriate. Just like if your hat is put on my head, will it necessarily fit perfectly? Using 'wooden plates' is suitable here, so there is no need to abandon 'wooden plates' and stubbornly learn from others' 'brick plate' method!"
    The *Dazhong Daily* published a signed short article saying: In real life, there is no one who takes other people's hats and puts them on their own heads regardless of whether they fit or not. However, in learning from the experiences of other places, it is not difficult to find the phenomenon of not starting from one's own conditions, not learning the spirit of others, but learning the form and mechanically imitating it.
    Learning from the experiences of other places is a good thing. There is no doubt that it should be greatly promoted. The problem is to adopt the correct attitude to learn. Chairman Mao taught us that there are two attitudes to learning. One is a dogmatic attitude, which is "dead learning and dead use." That is, regardless of one's own specific situation and whether it is applicable, as long as one hears that it is the experience of an advanced unit, one simply transplants everything and blindly follows it. It should be said that this is called "transplanting," not "learning." The other attitude is creative and flexible application. When learning, one is willing to use one's brain and think about problems, learn those things that are suitable for oneself and have universal significance, not learn the form and learn the superficial. When using, one pays more attention to starting from one's own conditions and using the experiences of others to solve one's own practical problems. What we need is this kind of attitude. Only in this way can we truly learn the experiences of other places.
    "Temporary Workers, Ideology Cannot Be Temporary"
    Gong Shusong, a temporary worker at the Yingtan Phosphate Fertilizer Factory, felt uneasy when he saw that some of the emerald green semi-finished phosphate fertilizer in the settling tank was being washed away by the water. He thought of Chairman Mao's teachings and said to himself: "Although I am a temporary worker, I also have the responsibility to serve the people. The work is temporary, but the ideology cannot be temporary!" He went barefoot into the water pool with a temperature of more than 40 degrees to retrieve the semi-finished phosphate fertilizer. His feet turned red, but he persisted in scooping it out, working for more than two hours, so that more than 700 kilograms of semi-finished phosphate fertilizer was not washed away by the water.
    The *Jiangxi Daily* said in a short article in "One Thing, One Discussion": "'Temporary workers, ideology cannot be temporary!' This sentence is very correct. Revolutionaries are doing revolution wherever they go, serving the people, so there can be no temporary ideology.
    Due to different divisions of labor and different revolutionary needs, some people have to work here, some people have to work there; some people have to work here temporarily for a period of time, and then transfer to other jobs, but no matter where they work, they should act in accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching: "Our team is entirely for the liberation of the people, and is thoroughly working for the interests of the people."
    Now, we still have temporary workers in some factories and enterprises. Although the work of temporary workers is temporary, doing revolution and serving the people is permanent and unconditional, and from this point of view, there is no distinction between temporary workers and permanent workers.
    "Temporary workers, ideology cannot be temporary!" Everyone should have this idea.

### 活跃在各地报纸上的活思想

    活跃在各地报纸上的活思想
    群众越忘我，领导越关心
    某部迫炮二连四班的战士，知道营部饲料房由于缺瓦盖不起来，就凑了一百六十元买了一车瓦送去。二连党支委会研究了这件好事，认为这种关心集体的思想，应该表扬，可是，战士们津贴费不多，捐多了会给他们的日常生活造成困难，不宜提倡。对这件事情，他们没有表扬一下就完事了，也没有简单的制止。而是通过这件事情，启发大家把关心集体的好思想，贯彻到日常工作和行动中去。
    《解放军报》在《一事一议》栏内发表短文说，对于这种好人好事好思想，当然是应该大大表扬的。然而，迫炮二连考虑到了更多的方面。战士这种热爱集体的思想是好的。我们革命战士总是把集体利益、革命利益放在第一位的，为了革命事业，生命都可以毫不犹豫地贡献出来，何况几个钱！但是，从领导来说，就需要全面地考虑。把全部积蓄拿出来，会影响战士的生活必需，同时，一心为公最重要的也并不表现在这里。强调公，不是不要私，反对个人主义，不是不要关心个人利益。保证合理的个人利益，也是发展集体事业所必需的。越是群众自觉地为了革命事业“忘我”的时候，领导上就越要关心他们才对。
    既然这样捐款买瓦不宜提倡，那么，制止一下不就完了吗？迫炮二连也没有这样做。因为群众这种关心集体的思想是好的，简单的制止，岂不是给群众的热情泼了冷水？他们采取说服教育和引导的办法，一方面讲通道理，把钱退还；一方面发动大家想办法拣废砖瓦，帮助大家把好事做完。这样，不但保护了群众的热情，提倡了好思想，而且把大家做好事的思想引导到更积极的方面，提高到更高的境界了。
    学先进的学问
    菏泽县安兴公社张楼大队，过去打井用“木盘”。这次学习郭庄大队经验，改用“砖盘”。井筒下落时极不稳定，严重地影响了工程质量。大队党支部书记张登爱访问了打井的“行家”——老贫农张兆兴，问他“木盘”是不是比“砖盘”好。张兆兴说：“学人家，也得看合适不合适。好比你的帽子戴在我头上，就一定可巧正好吗？咱这里用‘木盘’合适，就不必丢掉‘木盘’，硬去学人家的‘砖盘’法！”
    《大众日报》发表署名短文说：在现实生活中，拿别人的帽子，不管合适不合适，硬往自己头上套的人是没有的。然而，在学习外地经验中，不从自己的条件出发，不是学人家的精神，而是学形式，生搬硬套的现象却是不难找到的。
    学习外地经验是件好事。毫无疑问，应当大大提倡。问题是要采取正确的态度去学。毛主席教导我们，学习有两种态度。一种是教条主义的态度，是“死学死用”。就是不管自己的具体情况，也不管是否适用，只要听说是先进单位的经验，就统统搬来，盲目地照着干。应该说，这叫“搬”，不能叫“学”。另一种态度是创造性的活学活用。在学的时候，肯于动脑筋、想问题，学那些适合自己的、有普遍意义的东西，不是学形式，学皮毛；在用的时候，更注意从自己的条件出发，用别人的经验去解决自己的实际问题。我们需要的是这样一种态度。也只有这样，才能把外地的经验真正学到手。
    “临时工，思想不能临时”
    鹰潭磷肥厂临时工龚树松，看到沉淀池里翡翠色的磷肥半成品，有一部分被流水冲走了，心里很不安。他想起了毛主席的教导，对自己说：“我虽然是个临时工，也有为人民服务的责任，工作临时，思想可不能临时呀！”他赤脚下到水温四十多度的水池里取磷肥半成品，脚泡红了，还是坚持着捞，一直干了两个多小时，使七百多公斤磷肥半成品没有被水冲走。
    《江西日报》在《一事一议》短文中说：“临时工，思想不能临时！”这句话说得很对，革命者到哪里都是干革命，都是为人民服务，所以不能有临时思想。
    由于革命的分工和革命的需要不同，有人要在这里工作，有人要在那里工作；有人要在这里临时工作一段时间，再转入其他工作岗位，但是不管在哪里工作，都应该按照毛主席的这个教导办事：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”
    现在，我们有的工厂企业里还有临时工。临时工的工作虽然是临时的，但是干革命，为人民服务却是永远的，无条件的，从这个意义上来说，就无所谓临时工与正式工之分了。
    “临时工，思想不能临时！”每一个人都应该有这种思想。
