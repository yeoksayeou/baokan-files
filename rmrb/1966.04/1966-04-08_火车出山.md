    Editor's Note: In recent years, the socialist cultural revolution has seen new developments. A prominent symbol of the Cultural Revolution is the mass movement widely carried out by workers, peasants, and soldiers on the literary and artistic front, holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. From the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, a large number of excellent literary and artistic works constantly emerge, praising the great victories of socialist revolution and socialist construction, praising the new heroic figures on all fronts, and praising our great Party and great people; in particular, the large number of poems published by workers, peasants, and soldiers on wall posters and blackboard newspapers, both in content and form, mark out a brand-new era.
    Here are selected some works by workers, peasants, and soldiers from factory, rural, and military wall posters and blackboard newspapers. We will regularly select and publish such works, and we hope that factories, rural areas, and military units will regularly recommend excellent works by workers, peasants, and soldiers to us.
    Train Leaving the Mountain
    Northeast Forestry Worker Jia Fuchang
    Dashing through thousands of acres of green waves,
    Crossing over ten thousand layers of peaks,
    The lumber train, like a flying dragon,
    Rumbles out of the mountain.
    Draped in the splendid sunlight,
    Its entire body gleaming with golden light;
    The wheels sing a heroic song,
    The whistle shouts: Forward, forward!
    Wind and snow hastily make way,
    Wild beasts flee in droves,
    The forest bids farewell to the train heading to Beijing,
    Waving frequently: Bon voyage!
    The train's shadow gradually fades away,
    Leaving behind a trail of blue smoke,
    Ah, this ribbon of happiness,
    Tightly connects the Xing'an Mountains and Tiananmen.
    Carrying away a train of red pines and white birches,
    Also carrying the wishes of millions of lumberjacks:
    Every log becomes a colored pencil,
    To paint a more beautiful tomorrow for the motherland.

    编者按：近几年来，社会主义的文化大革命已经出现了新的形势。文化大革命的一个突出标志，就是工农兵高举毛泽东思想的红旗，在文艺战线上广泛开展的群众运动。从工农兵群众中，不断出现大量歌颂社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利，歌颂各个战线上的新英雄人物，歌颂我们伟大的党和伟大的人民的优秀文艺作品；特别是工农兵发表在墙报、黑板报上的大量诗歌，无论内容和形式，都划出了一个崭新的时代。
    这里选登了工厂、农村、部队的墙报和黑板报上的一部分工农兵作品。我们将经常选登这类作品，希望各工厂、农村、部队经常向我们推荐工农兵的优秀作品。
    火车出山
    东北林业工人　贾福昌
    驰过千顷碧涛，
    越过万重峰峦，
    运材火车象飞舞的巨龙，
    轰隆隆开出了山。
    披着绚丽的阳光，
    浑身金辉灿烂；
    车轮唱出雄壮的歌声，
    汽笛大喊：向前，向前！
    风雪急忙闪道，
    野兽纷纷逃窜，
    森林欢送火车开往北京，
    频频挥手：一路平安！
    车影渐渐远去，
    留下蓝色的轻烟，
    啊，这幸福的彩带哟，
    把兴安岭和天安门紧紧接连。
    载去一列车红松白桦，
    也载去千万伐木工的心愿：
    每根原木都变成彩笔，
    描绘出祖国更美好的明天。
