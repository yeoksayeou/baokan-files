    Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd. Pera Munidatileke, head of the Ceylon Journalists Association delegation, emphasized in his speech at the Fourth Plenary (Enlarged) Meeting of the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association on the 21st that only armed struggle can defeat the imperialists, and only through revolution can the world progress.
    In his speech, he exposed the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism and severely condemned those "two-faced false revolutionaries" who attempted to deceive the people with the so-called "peaceful coexistence" policy. He said that these traitors have become the despicable salesmen of Johnson's "peace swindle" and "unconditional discussions."
    Munidatileke said that today, we see the people's revolutionary movement constantly moving towards victory, while the imperialists and their running dogs are moving towards their doomsday. The glorious example of Vietnam has clearly demonstrated to the world that imperialists, no matter how strong their forces and what kind of modern weapons they use, will ultimately be defeated by the people who are fighting for a just cause, even if they are fighting bare-handed.
    He said that the struggle of the Vietnamese people is a just struggle. This struggle is receiving more and more support around the world, and even in the aggressor's own country, who is committing all kinds of heinous crimes in Vietnam, public opinion against Johnson's brutal policies is rising daily. We are convinced that the U.S. aggressors will surely fail, and the great Vietnamese people will ultimately triumph.
    He said that U.S. imperialism is the number one enemy of all peace-loving people in the world. It is not only expanding its war in Vietnam, but also expanding this war to the sovereign state of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, and even threatening the People's Republic of China. It uses its running dogs—South Korea, Japan, Thailand, Taiwan, Malaysia, etc.—to set up a series of camps around China in an attempt to "contain" this great country, which is the pioneer of all true anti-imperialist struggles in the world.
    Munidatileke then spoke about the recent developments in Indonesia. He said that it is no secret that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency has been secretly colluding with the right-wing, reactionary parties and elements in this country, especially those in the armed forces, for many years. A few months ago, the right-wing and reactionary forces in the Indonesian armed forces, instigated and assisted by the Central Intelligence Agency, established a completely fascist regime. I ask this conference to condemn in the strongest terms the pro-American regime in this country and its terror and fascist crimes against the innocent patriotic people of Indonesia.
    He said that in many countries in Africa, U.S. imperialism is also using the most vicious and despicable forms of aggression, subversion, and conspiracy to openly or secretly maintain their rule over these countries. The heroic African people in Azania, Congo (Leopoldville), Zimbabwe, Portuguese Guinea, Mozambique, Angola, etc., are resolutely fighting against the imperialists and colonialists who are brutally enslaving them, which is a great encouragement to us. In the Arab world, U.S. imperialism, in the name of Israel, has fostered a notorious and loyal vassal to subvert the independence and sovereignty of Arab countries. My country, Ceylon, has also been one of the central locations for large-scale subversive activities by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency for many years, with the help of its accomplices, local reactionaries, and press monopoly capital.
    Munidatileke emphasized that the aggressive arrogance of imperialism, mainly U.S. imperialism, has now reached a climax. However, at this time, imperialism, led by the United States, and neo- and old colonialism are also suffering greater and greater defeats, and are gradually approaching their graves. This is mainly because the people of the world, the fighting people, have clearly seen the nature of imperialism, and have realized that only armed struggle can defeat the imperialists, and only through revolution can the world progress. Precisely because the people have recognized these undeniable facts and are fighting on a solid, revolutionary basis, they can defeat the imperialists, no matter how powerful they are. He said, why is U.S. imperialism being defeated in South Vietnam? This is due to the strength of the people, due to their unity, due to the purity of their fighting goals, and especially due to their recognition that only armed struggle can and will send the enemy to the grave, thereby achieving victory.
    Munidatileke said that today, when the situation is so clear and the truth is out, we still see some people colluding with U.S. imperialism, thereby betraying the cause of the freedom-loving people of the world. These people desperately promote that they support the heroic liberation struggle of the Vietnamese people, but at the same time praise the U.S. imperialists, attempting to trick the Vietnamese people to the conference table. Today, they say that the imperialists are bad, and tomorrow they say that the imperialists are very good, saying that they will be as generous as giving New Year gifts and with good wishes to grant independence to those they have oppressed and exploited. Today, they say they hate and despise the imperialists, but tomorrow they sit with the representatives of the head of all the imperialists in the world, U.S. imperialism, and the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, Saigon, Seoul, Malaysia, and Thailand, to discuss various conspiracies to dominate the world. In our struggle against the imperialists, our bounden duty is to expose these traitors to the cause of the people of all countries, these two-faced false revolutionaries, who attempt to deceive the people with their so-called "peaceful coexistence" policy; these traitors have become the despicable salesmen of Johnson's "peace swindle" and "unconditional discussions."
    Munidatileke praised the role played by the Afro-Asian Journalists Association in uniting the fighting spirit of revolutionary journalists in Asia and Africa, and praised its great contributions to the cause of the fighting and peace-loving people of the two continents and the world. He said that this progressive, fighting-spirited journalists' organization has supported those it should support, defended those it should defend, and exposed those it should expose. The Ceylon delegation fully agrees with the Secretary-General's General Report and the report on the relocation of the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association from Jakarta.

    锡兰记协代表团团长穆尼蒂莱克的发言
    必须揭露和反对美帝和假革命者的阴谋
    新华社二十二日讯　锡兰新闻工作者协会代表团团长佩拉·穆尼蒂莱克二十一日在亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议（扩大）上发言时强调说，只有进行武装斗争才能击败帝国主义者，只有通过革命，世界才能进步。
    他在讲话中揭露了美帝国主义的侵略罪行，并且严厉地谴责了那些“两面三刀的假革命者”，企图以所谓的“和平共处”政策来欺骗人民。他说，这些叛徒已经成了约翰逊的“和平骗局”和“无条件讨论”的卑鄙推销员。
    穆尼蒂莱克说，今天，我们看到人民的革命运动正在不停地走向胜利，而帝国主义者和他们的走狗正在走向末日。越南的光辉榜样已十分清楚地向全世界证明，帝国主义者，不论他们兵力有多强和使用什么样的现代化武器，终究要被为一项真正的事业而战斗、甚至可能是徒手进行战斗的人民所击败。
    他说，越南人民的斗争是一场正义的斗争。这场斗争正在全世界得到愈来愈多的支持，即使是在那个正在越南干着种种穷凶极恶的罪恶勾当的侵略者的本国，反对约翰逊的残暴政策的舆论也正在逐日高涨。我们确信，美国侵略者一定会失败，伟大的越南人民最后一定会胜利。
    他说，美帝国主义是全世界所有爱好和平的人民的头号敌人。它不但正在扩大它在越南的战争，而且还在把这场战争扩大到主权国家越南民主共和国、柬埔寨和老挝，甚至威胁中华人民共和国。它利用它的走狗——南朝鲜、日本、泰国、台湾、马来西亚等等——在中国周围设置了一连串营地，以图“遏制”这个作为世界上一切真正的反帝斗争的先驱的伟大国家。
    穆尼蒂莱克接着谈到印度尼西亚最近的事态发展。他说，美国中央情报局多年来一直在同这个国家的右派、反动政党和分子、特别是在武装部队中的那些人暗中勾结，这已不是什么秘密。几个月前，印度尼西亚武装部队中的右派和反动派在中央情报局的唆使和帮助下建立了一个彻头彻尾的法西斯式的政权。我要求这次会议以最强烈的措词谴责这个国家的亲美政权和它对印度尼西亚无辜的爱国人民犯下的恐怖和法西斯罪行。
    他说，在非洲的许多国家，美帝国主义也在用最恶毒和最卑鄙方式的侵略、颠覆和阴谋以公开地或秘密地保持他们对这些国家的统治。在阿扎尼亚、刚果（利）、津巴布韦、葡属几内亚、莫三鼻给、安哥拉等地的英勇的非洲人民，正在对穷凶极恶地奴役他们的帝国主义和殖民主义进行坚决斗争，这对我们是很大的鼓舞。在阿拉伯世界，美帝国主义用以色列的名字扶植了一个臭名远扬的忠实的附庸，以颠覆阿拉伯国家的独立和主权。我的国家锡兰多年来也是美国中央情报局在它的同伙们、当地的反动派和报业垄断资本的帮助下大规模地进行颠覆活动的中心地点之一。
    穆尼蒂莱克强调说，帝国主义、主要是美帝国主义的侵略气焰现在已经到了一个高潮。但是，在这个时候，以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义同样也遭到越来越大的失败，正在逐步走近他们的坟墓。这主要是由于世界上的人民、战斗的人民已经清楚看到帝国主义的本性，已经认识到，只有进行武装斗争才能击败帝国主义者，只有通过革命，世界才能进步。正因为人民已经认识到这些无可争辩的事实并且正在坚实的、革命的基础上进行斗争，他们就能够击败帝国主义者，不管他们多么强大。他说，为什么美帝国主义在南越吃败仗呢？这是由于人民的力量，由于他们的团结一致，由于他们战斗的目的是纯正的，尤其是由于他们认识到，
    只有进行武装斗争才能够也才一定会把敌人送进坟墓，从而取得胜利。
    穆尼蒂莱克说，今天，当局势这样明朗，真相大白的时候，我们还看到有些人同美帝国主义勾结起来，从而背叛了世界上爱好自由的人民的事业。这些人拼命宣传他们是支持越南人民的英勇解放斗争的，可是同时又赞扬美帝国主义者，企图把越南人民骗到会议桌旁。今天，他们说帝国主义者很坏，而明天他们又说帝国主义者很好，说他们将象送新年礼物一样慷慨和抱着良好愿望给予他们所压迫和剥削的人们以独立。今天，他们说他们讨厌和藐视帝国主义者，而明天他们却同世界上的一切帝国主义者的头子美帝国主义者的代表和蒋介石集团、西贡、汉城、马来西亚和泰国的代表坐在一起，讨论主宰世界的各种阴谋计划。在我们同帝国主义者进行斗争的时候，我们的义不容辞的义务是揭露各国人民事业的这些背叛者，这些两面三刀的假革命者，他们企图以他们所谓的“和平共处”政策来欺骗人民；这些叛徒已经成了约翰逊的“和平骗局”和“无条件讨论”的卑鄙推销员。
    穆尼蒂莱克赞扬亚非新闻工作者协会在团结亚非富于战斗精神的革命新闻工作者方面所起的作用，赞扬它为两大陆和全世界的战斗和爱好和平的人民的事业作出了巨大贡献。他说，这个作为进步的、富于斗争精神的新闻工作者组织，支持了它应该支持的人，保卫了它应该保卫的人，也揭露了它应该揭露的人。锡兰代表团完全赞同总书记所作的总报告和关于亚非新闻工作者协会书记处撤离雅加达的报告。
