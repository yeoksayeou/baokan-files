    Self-Confession
    A reporter asked U.S. Under Secretary of State George Ball: If the "national election" in South Vietnam shows that the people of South Vietnam oppose the United States continuing to stay in South Vietnam, will the United States withdraw? Ball replied: "The majority, the overwhelming majority of Vietnamese want to maintain their freedom, and they know that in order to maintain this freedom, they need American help."
    This Under Secretary of State wanted to evade the question posed by the reporter, but in fact answered that question, which is: the United States will not withdraw from South Vietnam. At the same time, Ball let the cat out of the bag, saying that the "freedom" the United States claims to be safeguarding in South Vietnam is nothing more than "freedom" under American occupation.

    记者问美国副国务卿鲍尔：如果南越的“全国选举”结果表明南越人民反对美国继续呆在南越的话，美国是否会撤出？鲍尔答道：“大多数、压倒多数的越南人希望保持他们的自由，他们知道，为了保持这种自由，他们需要美国的帮助。”
    这个副国务卿想回避记者提出的问题，事实上却是回答了那个问题，这就是：美国是不会撤出南越的。同时，鲍尔说穿了，美国所谓要在南越维护的“自由”，不过是在美国占领下的“自由”罢了。
