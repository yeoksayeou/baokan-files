    Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch: Our reporter reports: The Indonesian government was the organizer and commander of the frantic attack on the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia by military police and thugs on the 15th, committing the bloody crime of injuring Chinese diplomats and seriously wounding staff with gunfire. Ironclad facts prove this. Jakarta Radio's broadcasts and Antara News Agency's reports have also unabashedly admitted this.
    According to Antara News Agency reports, before the thugs attacked the Chinese Embassy, an anti-China rally organized by the Indonesian government was held in Jakarta's Monas Square on the morning of the 15th. This murderous rally was actually a mobilization conference for creating this bloody atrocity. Indonesian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Adam Malik's representative, the Jakarta Military District Commander, and leaders of right-wing groups such as the "Indonesian University Students Action Unity Command" and the "Indonesian Youth and Students Action Unity Command," who are frantically carrying out anti-China, anti-communist, and anti-people riots throughout Indonesia, attended this rally. According to Western news agencies, the thugs at the meeting held up dozens of anti-China banners, while shouting anti-China slogans such as "Chinese get out" and "Crush Beijing," and chanting "Long live the Indonesian Armed Forces." It is reported that in order to coerce Chinese citizens to participate in this anti-China rally, the Indonesian right-wing military clique had printed "statements" in advance, forcing them to sign up and participate, and openly designated Chiang Kai-shek gang special agents to act as accomplices in attacking and destroying the Chinese Embassy. The official Indonesian Jakarta Radio also continuously "called on" Chinese citizens to "attend" the conference in its broadcasts on the eve of the rally.
    Adam Malik delivered a "written congratulatory message" to this anti-China rally, inciting anti-China sentiment. In his "congratulatory message," Malik said that some parties "try to gain rights in Indonesia, and even gain special rights to seek profit," and "engage in subversive activities," viciously inciting anti-China and anti-Chinese sentiment. He also threatened that the Indonesian government would take "a clear attitude and resolute measures," and whoever opposes the demands currently put forward by the right-wing reactionary forces "cannot gain the right to survive in Indonesia." However, feeling guilty, Malik then quibbled and denied the racist actions taken by the Indonesian government.
    Immediately after Malik delivered this anti-China "congratulatory message," this rally to mobilize anti-China sentiment passed a so-called "statement" consistent with Malik's anti-China clichés, shouting such things as "most strongly protesting the People's Republic of China's interference in Indonesia's internal affairs," and "opposing all threats and attacks from any side, including the People's Republic of China," etc.
    After this rally to mobilize anti-China sentiment, a large number of armed military police and armored vehicles, accompanied by thugs transported in trucks, went to the Chinese Embassy to carry out a barbaric attack.
    The right-wing military regime is the direct organizer, commander, and murderer of this bloody crime. The ironclad evidence is irrefutable!
    The Antara News Agency's news report on the attack on the Chinese Embassy that day is another "confession" of the right-wing military regime's anti-China crimes. The news agency proudly reported the atrocities of the armed military police and thugs attacking the Chinese Embassy. It said that this group of thugs "came to the Chinese Embassy after holding a roll call rally in Monas Square." The thugs "used ten-ton trucks to smash the front door, and then rushed into the embassy. In the ensuing fight with embassy staff, one embassy staff member was seriously injured... The five-star red flag was torn down from the flagpole and torn to pieces. At the same time, the Indonesian two-color flag was raised to the sound of the Indonesian national anthem. The Chinese national emblem was also removed from the gate wall and burned. Furniture was moved out of the house and piled up in the yard for burning. The demonstrators (thugs) also searched the rooms for important documents and photos, and later handed them over to the authorities." The news agency also said that this group of thugs "also managed to smash the inner door leading to the backyard. Here they smashed several cars of the embassy..."
    However, while admitting these atrocities, Antara News Agency attempted to slander and shift the blame, falsely accusing the Chinese Embassy of "opening fire" on the thugs. Antara News Agency said that "two shots were fired from the (Chinese Embassy's) building, apparently fired by the Chinese." An Indonesian army officer told a Reuters reporter that "a group of embassy staff fired on the demonstrators with machine guns. Three people were injured." The Indonesian right-wing military clique, in order to cover up its heinous crimes, resorted to fabricating rumors and slander, and turned around to bite. They have played this trick more than once. Some time ago, after attacking our consulates in Medan and Makassar, they also fabricated such rumors, which were later exposed and bankrupted. Now, they are once again repeating this self-deceiving trick. This can only further expose their robber faces in front of the Indonesian people and the people of the world.
    The anti-China crimes of the Indonesian reactionary military regime are so frantic that even Hitler's fascists and Japanese militarism are overshadowed. However, this does not show its strength, on the contrary, it only shows its weakness and its frantic struggle.

    血腥罪行，铁证如山，绝对抵赖不了！
    印尼军人政权是袭击我使馆的组织者指挥者和凶手
    印度尼西亚副总理兼外交部长马利克在反华集会上明目张胆地煽动反华
    新华社十六日讯　本社记者报道：印度尼西亚政府是十五日出动军警和暴徒疯狂袭击中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆的组织者和指挥者，犯下了打伤中国外交官和开枪重伤工作人员的血腥罪行。铁一般的事实证明了这一点。雅加达电台的广播和安塔拉通讯社的报道也都毫不隐讳地供认了这一点。
    据安塔拉通讯社报道，在暴徒袭击中国大使馆之前，十五日上午在雅加达的雄牛广场举行了由印度尼西亚政府组织的反华集会。这次杀气腾腾的集会实际上是制造这次血腥暴行的动员大会。印度尼西亚副总理兼外交部长阿达姆·马利克的代表，雅加达军区司令，在全印度尼西亚疯狂进行反华、反共、反人民暴乱活动的“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动组织”和“印度尼西亚青年学生统一行动组织”等右派团体的首领参加了这个集会。据西方通讯社报道，与会暴徒高举几十幅反华标语，一边狂叫“中国人滚走”、“粉碎北京”等反华口号，一边高喊“印度尼西亚武装部队万岁”。据报道，为了胁迫华裔公民参加这个反华集会，印度尼西亚右派军人集团事先印发了“声明”，挨家挨户强迫他们签字参加，并公然指定蒋帮特务分子充当袭击、破坏中国大使馆的帮凶。印度尼西亚官方的雅加达电台在这个集会的前夕，也在广播中不断“呼吁”华裔公民“出席”大会。
    阿达姆·马利克，向这个反华集会发表了一个煽动反华的“书面贺词”。马利克在“贺词”中说什么有某些方面“设法在印度尼西亚获得权利，甚至获得寻找利润的特殊权利”，“搞颠覆活动”，恶毒地煽动反华排华。他还威胁说，印度尼西亚政府要采取“明确的态度和坚决的措施”，谁反对右派反动势力“当前提出的要求，他就不能在印度尼西亚获得生存的权利。”但是，作贼心虚的马利克，接着又强词诡辩，抵赖印度尼西亚政府所采取的种族主义行动。
    就在马利克发表这个煽动反华的“贺词”以后，这个动员反华的集会通过了一个同马利克的反华滥调相一致的所谓“声明”，叫喊什么“最强烈地抗议中华人民共和国干涉印度尼西亚内政”，“反对来自任何方面，包括中华人民共和国在内的一切威胁和攻击”等等。
    在这次动员反华的集会以后，大批武装军警和装甲车随同用卡车装运的暴徒，一起开到中国大使馆进行了野蛮的袭击。
    右派军人政权是这次血腥罪行的直接组织者、指挥者和凶手，铁证如山，是绝对抵赖不了的！
    安塔拉通讯社当天发出的有关袭击中国大使馆的消息，是右派军人政权反华罪行的又一个“自供状”。这家通讯社洋洋得意地报道了武装军警和暴徒袭击中国大使馆的暴行。它说，这批暴徒“在雄牛广场举行唱名集会后来到中国大使馆”。暴徒们“使用十吨的卡车撞毁了前门，然后涌入使馆。在随后同使馆人员的搏斗中，有一名使馆人员受重伤……五星红旗从旗杆上扯了下来，撕成碎片。同时，在印度尼西亚国歌声中升起了印度尼西亚两色国旗。中国国徽也被从大门墙上拆下来烧毁。家具被从屋子里搬出来堆在院子里焚烧。示威者（暴徒）还在房间里搜寻重要文件和照片，后来把它们交给了当局”。这家通讯社还说，这批暴徒“还设法砸毁通往后院的里门。在这里他们砸坏使馆的若干辆汽车……”
    但是，安塔拉通讯社在供认这些暴行的同时，却又企图倒打一耙，嫁祸于人，胡说什么暴徒所以要非法强行闯进并袭击中国大使馆，是因为中国大使馆“紧闭大门”，“牢牢地上着锁”。这是彻头彻尾的强盗逻辑！请问印度尼西亚右派先生们，你们一再践踏国际法的起码准则，破坏外交代表机构和外交人员不可侵犯的特权，接连对中国的外交机构进行了十多次强盗袭击，难道在你们出动大批武装军警和暴徒，甚至出动装甲车前来行凶的时候，中国大使馆还要“开门揖盗”，请你们来进行杀人放火的勾当吗？
    安塔拉通讯社掩饰右派军人政权野蛮袭击中国大使馆的罪行的另一个手法是造谣，反诬中国大使馆对暴徒“开了枪”。安塔拉通讯社说什么“从（中国使馆的）建筑物里开出两枪，显然是中国人开的枪”。一名印度尼西亚陆军军官又对路透社记者说什么“一群大使馆工作人员用机枪对示威者开火。三人负伤。”印度尼西亚右派军人集团为了掩饰它犯下的滔天罪行，竟乞灵于造谣诬蔑，反咬一口。他们玩弄这种伎俩已不是第一次了。他们前些时候在袭击我棉兰、望加锡领事馆后，也曾造过这种谣言，后来都被揭穿，遭到破产。现在，他们又一次重施这种自欺欺人的伎俩。这只能在印度尼西亚人民和全世界人民面前，进一步暴露他们的强盗嘴脸。
    印度尼西亚反动军人政权如此疯狂的反华罪行，使希特勒法西斯和日本军国主义都为之黯然失色。但是，这决不说明它的强大，恰恰相反，只能说明它的虚弱，说明它的疯狂挣扎。
