    Xinhua News Agency, Dhaka, April 17th. After concluding a friendly visit to Pakistan, Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife, Wang Guangmei, left Dhaka, the capital of East Pakistan, on a special plane on the morning of the 17th for Rangoon, the capital of the Union of Burma.

    Pakistani President Ayub Khan and East Pakistan Governor Abdul Monem Khan went to the airport to see Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife off.

    Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi and his wife, Zhang Qian, Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Hanfu, and other accompanying personnel who accompanied Chairman Liu Shaoqi on the visit also left here on the same plane.

    When Chairman Liu Shaoqi, accompanied by President Ayub Khan and Governor Abdul Monem Khan, drove to the airport, more than 100,000 local people stood on both sides of the street, waving Chinese and Pakistani national flags, ribbons, and small pennants, holding colored balloons, and shouting "Long live Sino-Pakistani friendship" to bid farewell to the distinguished Chinese guests. As the motorcade passed, some of them scattered flower petals, while others sang folk songs and danced.

    The crowd bid farewell to the Chinese guests warmly, wishing them a safe journey.

    Chinese and Pakistani flags fluttered over the airport. After the Chinese guests arrived, the band played the national anthems of the two countries. Chairman Liu Shaoqi, accompanied by President Ayub Khan, reviewed the guard of honor composed of the three services of Pakistan.

    Before boarding the plane, Chairman Liu Shaoqi warmly shook hands with President Ayub Khan, Governor Abdul Monem Khan, Foreign Minister Bhutto and his wife, other central government ministers, and other well-wishers. Four Pakistani girls presented flowers to Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife, Vice Premier Chen Yi and his wife.

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi stood at the door of the cabin and waved goodbye to the thousands of people gathered at the airport and on the airport balcony. Huge cheers erupted from the crowd.

    The crowd repeatedly shouted slogans such as "Long live Sino-Pakistani friendship" and "Long live Asian-African solidarity," and the slogans resounded through the sky. As the plane was about to take off, a 21-gun salute was fired.

    Also present at the airport to see Chairman Liu Shaoqi off were: Central Government Minister of Communications Khan A. Sabur Khan, Minister of Industry and Natural Resources Altaf Hussain, Minister of Engineering, Food and Agriculture Shams-ud Doha, Minister of Interior and Kashmir Affairs Chaudhri Ali Akbar Khan, Speaker of the East Pakistan Provincial Assembly Abdul Hamid Choudhury, ministers of the East Pakistan Provincial Government, members of the National Assembly and Provincial Assembly, and other senior military and government officials and well-known local figures.

    Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Ding Guoyu and Pakistani Ambassador to China Rochan also went to the airport to see them off.

    Also present at the airport to see them off were: diplomatic officials of the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan, Chinese Consul General in Dhaka Wang Ze, and staff of the Chinese Consulate General in Dhaka.

    Heads of various consulates in Dhaka also went to the airport to see them off.

    Xinhua News Agency, Dhaka, April 16th. East Pakistan Governor Abdul Monem Khan held a grand banquet for Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife at the Governor's House here on the 16th.

    President Ayub Khan attended the banquet. Foreign Minister Bhutto and his wife also attended the banquet.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi and his wife, Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Hanfu, and other accompanying personnel of Chairman Liu were also invited to attend the banquet.

    At the banquet, Governor Abdul Monem Khan and Chairman Liu Shaoqi raised their glasses in a toast.

    In his toast, Abdul Monem Khan said: "Our people have a very deep impression of the achievements you have made in various fields of social and economic activities, and are particularly satisfied with the development of friendly relations between our two countries. This relationship has been strengthened more permanently and comprehensively because the Chinese people and government took a just stand in supporting Pakistan's cause when we resisted foreign aggression not long ago. We will never forget the friends who supported our cause."

    He said: "The support of the great Chinese people for the just cause of the people of Jammu and Kashmir is admired not only by the people of Pakistan, but also by all those who believe in the principle of self-determination and abide by international obligations."

    He pointed out that the establishment of good-neighborly cooperation and understanding between Pakistan and China is a positive contribution to world peace.

    He raised his glass to wish Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi and other Chinese guests good health and longevity.

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi then raised his glass in a toast. He said that during this visit, whether in West Pakistan or East Pakistan, we deeply felt the warm friendship of the great Pakistani people towards the Chinese people. Chairman Liu expressed his heartfelt thanks to President Ayub Khan and Governor Abdul Monem Khan, and to the fraternal Pakistani people.

    Chairman Liu said: "In recent years, the Pakistani people's struggle to safeguard national independence and state sovereignty is admirable. Last September, the people of West Pakistan bravely fought and defeated India's armed aggression; at the same time, the army and people of East Pakistan were also prepared, so that the Indian aggressors did not dare to attack East Pakistan. The Chinese people have resolutely supported your just struggle in the past. In the future, if the aggressors dare to launch another attack on you, the Chinese people will still unhesitatingly support your resistance to aggression."

    Chairman Liu also said: "When I visited West Pakistan, I said that apart from uniting against aggression, we have no special demands on each other. This is the foundation of friendship between the two peoples, and it is also a guarantee for the further development of this friendship. The people of our two countries welcome this friendship, and the people of Asian and African countries welcome this friendship. This friendship is open and aboveboard, and it is something we are proud of. The people of our two countries will never allow any force to undermine this friendship."

    Chairman Liu finally proposed a toast to the lasting friendship between the Chinese and Pakistani peoples, to the cause of unity against imperialism of the peoples of Asian and African countries, and to the health of President Ayub Khan and Governor Abdul Monem Khan and other Pakistani friends.

    The Governor's House was brilliantly illuminated by countless colored light bulbs. The entire banquet was filled with a friendly atmosphere.

    Approximately five hundred people attended the banquet, including Pakistani Minister of Communications Abdul Sabur Khan, Minister of Industry and Natural Resources Altaf Hussain, Minister of Engineering, Food and Agriculture Shams-ud Doha, ministers of the East Pakistan Provincial Government, members of the National Assembly and East Pakistan Provincial Assembly, other senior military and government officials, and well-known figures from all walks of life in Dhaka.

    Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Ding Guoyu and Pakistani Ambassador to China Rochan also attended the banquet.

    Also attending the banquet were Chinese Consul General in Dhaka Wang Ze and the heads of many consulates in Dhaka.

    When the Chinese guests drove to the Governor's House, many citizens lined the streets to welcome them. After the banquet ended, although it was late at night, many welcoming crowds were still gathered on the streets. The colorful lights illuminated the streets magnificently. (Photo attached)

    刘少奇主席站在机舱门口，向聚集在机场上和机场阳台上的几千人挥手告别，人群中发出了巨大的欢呼声。

    刘主席说：“这几年来，巴基斯坦人民维护民族独立和国家主权的斗争，是令人钦佩的。去年九月，西巴基斯坦人民奋勇抗战，打败了印度的武装侵略；同时，东巴基斯坦军队和人民也作好了准备，使印度侵略者不敢向东巴基斯坦进攻，中国人民在过去坚决地支持了你们的正义斗争。在今后，如果侵略者敢于再向你们发动进攻，中国人民仍将毫不犹豫地支持你们反抗侵略。”
    刘主席还说：“我在访问西巴基斯坦的时候说过，我们双方除了团结反对侵略以外，彼此没有任何特殊的要求。这是两国人民友谊的基础，也是这种友谊进一步发展的保证。我们两国人民欢迎这种友谊，亚非各国人民欢迎这种友谊。这种友谊是光明磊落的，是值得我们骄傲的。我们两国人民决不容许任何力量破坏这种友谊。”
    刘主席最后提议为中巴两国人民的持久友谊，为亚非各国人民团结反帝的事业，为阿尤布·汗总统和阿卜杜勒·穆奈姆·汗省督以及其他巴基斯坦朋友们的健康干杯。
