    For Whom Are You Providing "Theoretical" Weapons?
                Wu Shirong
    Comrade Wu Han has put forward a strange "theory": he said that in feudal society, there were some officials whose actions "conformed to the long-term interests of the feudal ruling class" and "were also consistent with the current interests of the broad masses of the people." What kind of "theory" is this?
    Anyone with a little common sense knows that the interests of antagonistic classes are fundamentally opposed and cannot be reconciled at all. Comrade Wu Han insisted that the class interests of the landlord class and the class interests of the peasants were "consistent." This is a theory of class conciliation through and through!
    Comrade Wu Han's "theory" fundamentally opposes Marxism. Engels said long ago: "Since the basis of civilization is the exploitation of one class by another, then...the interests of one class must be a disaster for another class" ("The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State"). Countless facts at home and abroad have proved the correctness of this basic principle of Marxism. Taking the Ming Dynasty mentioned in Comrade Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" as an example, historical records tell us that the rich at that time "had the capital of dukes and marquises," while the general poor peasants lived a tragic life of "food for dogs and pigs." The peasants worked all year round, but could not get enough to eat or wear, and the grain was plundered by the government and landlords. How could their interests be "consistent"?
    Let's take the situation in Sichuan before liberation as an example. In Dayi, there was a notorious landlord tyrant named Liu Wencai's manor. Everyone knows that Liu Wencai lived a life of luxury, extravagance, and shamelessness. In addition to delicacies from land and sea every day, he also had seven wet nurses specially squeezing milk to feed him and draw people's blood to nourish him. Liu Wencai's landlord manor was a "paradise" built on the bones of peasants. It was a "paradise" for Liu Wencai, but it was a man-eating "hell" for the broad masses of peasants. One "paradise" and one "hell," why did Comrade Wu Han insist on pulling them together and saying that the class interests of the peasants could be "consistent" with the class interests of the landlord class?
    Isn't Comrade Wu Han always talking about historical truth? Why do you ignore even these basic common sense and vivid realities? What are your intentions!
    Isn't Comrade Wu Han always saying that "historical reality" serves "current reality"? Then, what kind of reality does your distortion of the past historical reality to promote the theory of class conciliation serve!
    As everyone knows, from 1959 to 1962, the class enemies at home and abroad took advantage of the serious natural disasters in our country to launch a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism, and whipped up the black winds of "individual farming," "liberalization," "reversal of verdicts," and "three freedoms and one guarantee." The bourgeoisie tried every means to promote to the workers: "Capitalists started their businesses by being diligent and thrifty," "Capitalists and workers are one family," and so on. Landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries also tried their best to promote to the peasants in various ways, "Now that we have collectivized, everyone relies on work points to eat, we are all one family." Some also used feudal clan relations to say, "Everyone has the same ancestor, where are there any class boundaries." Some also used methods such as recognizing relatives and forming in-law relationships to win over and corrupt cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants, engage in large-scale feudal superstitious activities, blur the class consciousness of the masses, and carry out restoration activities. Under this sharp and complex situation of class struggle, Comrade Wu Han vigorously promoted this reactionary theory, not for anything else, but precisely to provide "theoretical" weapons for right-leaning opportunists to oppose the Party and socialism, and for the restoration activities of class enemies.

### 为谁提供“理论”武器？

    为谁提供“理论”武器？
                伍世荣
    吴晗同志提出了一个奇怪的“理论”：他说封建社会中，有这么一批官僚，他们的一些作为，既“符合封建统治阶级的长远利益”，“也和广大人民的当前利益一致”。这是一个什么“理论”呢？
    稍微有点常识的人都知道，敌对阶级之间的利益，是根本对立的，两者绝不能调和。吴晗同志却硬说地主阶级的阶级利益和农民的阶级利益相“一致”。这是彻头彻尾的阶级调和的理论！
    吴晗同志的这条“理论”，是从根本上反对马克思主义的。恩格斯早就说过：“文明底基础既是一个阶级剥削另一个阶级，那末……对一个阶级的利益，必然是对别一个阶级的灾难”（《家庭、私有制和国家的起源》）。古今中外的无数事实，无不证明马克思主义这个基本原理的正确。就拿吴晗同志《海瑞罢官》所讲的明代来说，文献记载告诉我们，当时富人“有公侯之资”，而一般贫苦农民则过着“为狗彘之食”的悲惨生活。农民终年劳动，吃不饱穿不暖，粮食都被官府和地主搜刮去了。他们之间的利益怎么能够“一致”起来呢？
    远的不说，就拿我们四川解放前的情况来看。大邑有个大恶霸地主刘文彩的庄园。大家都晓得，刘文彩过着奢侈豪华、荒淫无耻的生活，每天除了山珍海味以外，还要七个奶妈专门挤奶来喂养他，抽人血液滋补他。刘文彩的地主庄园就是建立在农民白骨堆上的“天堂”，对于刘文彩来说是“天堂”，而对于广大的农民来说，就是吃人的“地狱”。一个“天堂”，一个“地狱”，吴晗同志为什么硬要把它们扯在一起，说农民的阶级利益可以和地主阶级的阶级利益“一致”呢？
    吴晗同志不是口口声声要讲历史真实吗？你为什么连这些起码的常识和活生生的现实都不顾了呢？你究竟是什么居心！
    吴晗同志不是口口声声讲“历史实际”是为“当前的实际”服务的吗？那么，你这种歪曲过去的历史实际，来宣扬阶级调和论，究竟是为什么样的现实服务！
    大家知道，一九五九年到一九六二年，国内外的阶级敌人趁我国遭到严重自然灾害的时候，向党和社会主义发动了猖狂的进攻，刮起“单干”、“自由化”、“翻案”和“三自一包”的黑风。资产阶级千方百计向工人宣传：“资本家是靠勤俭起家的”，“资本家与工人是一家人”，等等。地主、富农、反革命分子也通过各种方式，极力向农民鼓吹“现在集体化了，大家都靠工分吃饭，我们都是一家人了”。有的还利用封建宗族关系，说什么“大家都是一个祖宗，哪里还有什么阶级界限”。有的还用认亲戚、打干亲家等手法，拉拢腐蚀干部和贫农下中农，大搞封建迷信活动，模糊群众的阶级意识，进行复辟活动。在这种尖锐复杂的阶级斗争的形势下，吴晗同志极力宣扬这个反动理论，不是为了别的，正是为了给右倾机会主义分子反党、反社会主义，给阶级敌人的复辟活动提供“理论”武器。
