    Chairman Liu Shaoqi's friendly visit to Pakistan has concluded. During the visit, Chairman Liu Shaoqi received a grand and warm welcome from Pakistani President Mohammad Ayub Khan, the Pakistani government, and the people of Pakistan. In Rawalpindi, the temporary capital of Pakistan, hundreds of thousands of citizens braved torrential rain to welcome the Chinese guests. In Lahore, the glorious city that once bravely repelled the Indian aggressors, a million people took to the streets, shouting "Friendship, friendship." Whether in West Pakistan or East Pakistan, the cheers of "Long live Pakistan-China friendship" resounded everywhere the Chinese leaders went. This enthusiastic welcome from the Pakistani government and people to our country's leaders fully embodies the unbreakable friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan. The Chinese people express their heartfelt gratitude for the warm sentiments of the Pakistani people!
    "Sino-Pakistani friendship is not an expediency, but has a solid foundation." The joint communique of the talks between the leaders of China and Pakistan clearly points this out, which is of great significance for developing the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries and enhancing the friendship between the two peoples.
    Why is it said that Sino-Pakistani friendship is not an expediency? The history of the past ten years has already answered this question.
    Facts have proven that the friendly relationship between our two countries is based on principles. Over the past ten years, China and Pakistan have not changed their respective positions towards each other due to changes in this or that situation.
    Facts have proven that the peoples of China and Pakistan fundamentally share common interests. We both want to safeguard national independence and sovereignty, oppose foreign aggression and threats, and further develop the national economy to make our motherlands prosperous and strong. This common struggle and common aspiration unite the peoples of China and Pakistan.
    Facts have also proven that Sino-Pakistani friendship has taken root in the hearts of the people of both countries. No matter how the international situation changes, the peoples of China and Pakistan will be friendly to each other for generations to come. This close relationship between the peoples of China and Pakistan is difficult for any force to undermine.
    Sino-Pakistani friendship not only fully conforms to the interests of the people of both countries, but also fully conforms to the interests of Asian-African solidarity and world peace. However, Indian expansionists and the propaganda machines of certain countries have slandered the Chinese and Pakistani people as "belligerent" and "aggressive." This is complete nonsense.
    Regarding what constitutes aggression and who is the aggressor, there are different interpretations from different standpoints. Not long ago, the Pakistani people bravely resisted the armed aggression of Indian expansionists. Similarly, the Chinese people, in order to defend national sovereignty from infringement, also waged a resolute struggle against Indian expansionists. However, the Indian expansionists and their backers have blamed the Chinese and Pakistani people for aggression. Imperialism and all reactionaries only allow themselves to bully and invade other countries, and do not allow others to resist. If the people of the invaded countries rise up to resist and defend the independence and sovereignty of their motherlands, they are considered rebellious by them. However, the truth is in the hearts of the people. In the eyes of all peace-loving people, the Indian reactionaries' launching of armed aggression against Pakistan is a blatant act of aggression that undermines peace on the subcontinent. The Pakistani people's resistance to the Indian army's attack is a just action against aggression and in defense of peace. The Chinese government and people support the Pakistani people's struggle against aggression precisely to uphold justice and safeguard peace in Asia. Those forces that shield and support the Indian aggressors are the culprits who endanger and undermine peace.
    At the welcoming banquet hosted by President Ayub Khan, Chairman Liu Shaoqi said: "We have always believed that the Kashmir dispute should be resolved in accordance with the wishes of the Kashmiri people. Any attempt to deprive the Kashmiri people of their right to self-determination and bury the Kashmir issue will not be accepted by the Kashmiri people, nor will it be accepted by the Pakistani people." It is well known that Pakistan and India once assured the Kashmiri people that the Kashmir issue would be resolved in accordance with the wishes of the Kashmiri people. However, the Indian authorities have gone back on their word, attempting to deprive the Kashmiri people of their right to self-determination and vainly attempting to occupy Kashmir forever. This will inevitably arouse the resistance of the Kashmiri people. The Chinese government and people support Pakistan's solemn attitude towards the Kashmir issue and support the just struggle of the Kashmiri people to achieve the right to self-determination. China's principled position will never change.
    Pakistani friends often say that the Pakistani people are grateful to the Chinese people for their support in their struggle against foreign aggression. We have always believed that such support and assistance are mutual. The victory of the Pakistani people's struggle against aggression is also support and assistance to the Chinese people.
    Now, the Indian reactionaries and the propaganda machines of certain countries are making a great fuss about the mutual support of the Chinese and Pakistani people in the struggle against aggression and in defense of peace, saying that the friendship between the Chinese and Pakistani people makes them feel "uneasy" and "annoyed," and so on. What exactly is making the gentlemen in New Delhi and elsewhere so restless? It is a normal thing in international relations for the national leaders of China to pay friendly visits to their neighboring countries. Why do you have to feel "uneasy" and "annoyed"? Both China and Pakistan are sovereign states. The Chinese and Pakistani people, like the people of other countries in the world, have the right to choose their own friends and do not allow anyone to interfere. Your inexplicable concern about the friendship between the Chinese and Pakistani people precisely shows that you are afraid of the unity of the Chinese and Pakistani people. Because with this unity, your aggressive conspiracies and expansionist plans will be difficult to succeed.
    The friendship between the Chinese and Pakistani people can stand the test. This friendship will inevitably be strengthened with the passage of time. Chairman Liu Shaoqi's visit to Pakistan has written a new brilliant chapter in the history of friendship between China and Pakistan. The further consolidation and development of Sino-Pakistani friendship is a major contribution to the cause of Asian-African solidarity and the defense of world peace.

### 中巴友谊是经得住考验的

    中巴友谊是经得住考验的
    刘少奇主席对巴基斯坦的友好访问结束了。在访问过程中，刘少奇主席受到巴基斯坦总统穆罕默德·阿尤布·汗、巴基斯坦政府和人民的隆重、热烈的欢迎。在巴基斯坦临时首都拉瓦尔品第，数十万市民冒着倾盆大雨，迎接中国客人。在曾经英勇反击印度侵略者的光荣城市拉合尔，百万人民拥上街头，高呼“友好，友好”。无论在西巴或东巴，中国领导人所到之处，“巴中友好万岁”的欢呼声响彻云霄。巴基斯坦政府和人民对我国领导人的这种热情洋溢的欢迎，充分体现了中、巴两国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊。中国人民对巴基斯坦人民的盛情厚意，表示衷心的感谢！
    “中巴友好不是权宜之计，是有牢固的基础的。”中巴两国领导人会谈联合公报明确地指出这一点，对于发展两国的友好合作关系，增进两国人民的友谊，有着重要的意义。
    为什么说中巴友好不是权宜之计呢？过去十多年的历史，已经回答了这个问题。
    事实证明，我们两国之间的友好关系，是有原则的。十多年来，中、巴两国没有因为这种情况或那种情况的变化，而改变各自对对方的立场。
    事实证明，中、巴两国人民在根本上有着共同利益。我们都要维护国家的独立和主权，反对外来的侵略和威胁，并进一步发展民族经济，使自己的祖国繁荣和富强起来。这种共同的斗争和共同的愿望，把中、巴两国人民联结在一起。
    事实也证明，中、巴友谊已在两国人民的心灵深处扎下了根。不管国际局势怎样变幻，中、巴人民是要世世代代地友好相处的。中、巴两国人民的这种亲密关系，是任何势力所难以破坏的。
    中、巴友好不仅完全符合两国人民的利益，同时也完全符合亚非团结和世界和平的利益。但是，印度扩张主义者和某些国家的宣传机器，竟然诬蔑中、巴人民“好战”和“侵略”。这完全是胡说八道。
    对于什么是侵略，谁是侵略者，站在不同的立场上，就有不同的说法。不久以前，巴基斯坦人民奋勇抵抗了印度扩张主义者的武装进攻。同样，中国人民为了保卫国家主权的不受侵犯，也对印度扩张主义者进行了坚决的斗争。而印度扩张主义者和它的后台老板，却把侵略的罪名加到中国人民和巴基斯坦人民头上。帝国主义和一切反动派，总是只许它们欺负和侵略别的国家，不许别人起来反抗。如果被侵略国家的人民奋起抵抗，保卫祖国的独立和主权，就被它们认为是大逆不道。但是，真理自在人心。在一切爱好和平的人民看来，印度反动派发动对巴基斯坦的武装进攻，是赤裸裸的侵略罪行，破坏了次大陆的和平。巴基斯坦人民起来反击印度军队的进攻，是反对侵略、保卫和平的正义行动。中国政府和人民支持巴基斯坦人民的反侵略斗争，正是为了伸张正义、维护亚洲和平。而那些包庇和支持印度侵略者的势力，才是危害和破坏和平的罪人。
    在阿尤布·汗总统的欢迎宴会上，刘少奇主席说：“我们一贯认为，克什米尔争端应当按照克什米尔人民的愿望加以解决。任何剥夺克什米尔人民的自决权利、埋葬克什米尔问题的企图，在克什米尔人民当中是通不过的，在巴基斯坦人民当中，也是通不过的。”人所共知，巴基斯坦和印度曾经向克什米尔人民作过保证，要按照克什米尔人民的愿望来解决克什米尔问题。但是印度当局背信弃义，企图剥夺克什米尔人民的自决权利，妄图永远霸占克什米尔。这就必然激起克什米尔人民的反抗。中国政府和人民支持巴基斯坦对于克什米尔问题的严正态度，支持克什米尔人民争取自决权的正义斗争。中国的这个原则立场，是绝对不会改变的。
    巴基斯坦的朋友们常常说，巴基斯坦人民感谢中国人民对他们反抗外国侵略斗争的支持。我们一向认为，这种支持和援助是相互的。巴基斯坦人民反侵略斗争的胜利，也是对中国人民的支持和援助。
    现在，印度反动派和某些国家的宣传机器，对中、巴人民在反对侵略、维护和平的斗争中的相互支持，大放厥词，说什么中、巴人民的友谊使它们感到“不安”啦、“恼火”啦，等等。新德里等地的老爷们，究竟是什么东西使得你们如此惶惶不可终日呢？中国的国家领导人到自己的邻邦进行友好访问，这本来是国际关系中的正常的事情，你们为什么要感到“不安”和“恼火”呢？中国和巴基斯坦都是主权国家。中国人民和巴基斯坦人民，同世界上其他国家的人民一样，有权选择自己的朋友，不容许任何人加以干涉。你们对中、巴人民的友谊表示莫名其妙的担忧，恰恰说明你们害怕中巴人民的团结。因为有了这种团结，你们的侵略阴谋和扩张计划就难以得逞了。
    中巴人民的友谊是经得住考验的。这种友谊必将随着时间的推移而日益加强。刘少奇主席这次访问巴基斯坦，在中、巴两国的友谊史上，写下了新的灿烂的篇章。中、巴友谊的进一步巩固和发展，是对亚非团结和保卫世界和平的事业的重大贡献。
