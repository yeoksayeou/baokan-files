    New Forces are Tempered in Hard Struggle
    The Growth of a Heroic Battalion
    [Vietnam] Qing Liu
    “409! Dawn!”
    Immediately, the radio in the command post transmitted the reply from the air:
    “409, understood!”
    High in the sky, jet fighters, like silver swallows, cut through the clouds and gradually descended, gliding nimbly across the runway. …
    Our Air Force First Battalion was born at a time when American bandits were dispatching their air force every day to spread death and suffering in our country. It embodies the heroic Vietnamese People's Army's tradition of fighting to the finish and winning. This spirit of fighting to the finish comes from the blood feud with the American bandits. Repeated accusations of the American bandits' crimes have made all comrades understand each other better and become as close as siblings. All the soldiers in this battalion have relatives who were brutally murdered by the imperialists. Hatred for American imperialism, and the sacred mission of resisting America and saving the nation, defending the North, and supporting the liberation of the South, have tempered the comrades' iron will to eliminate the enemy. In the past, how much they hoped that one day they could fly their planes, rush up and smash the enemy planes to pieces!
    That wish has finally become a reality today. The Party has given them jet fighters one after another, and places deep trust in them. They will never fail to live up to this trust.
    In a revolutionary army, no matter which service it is, when it is first established, it is always weaker than the enemy. The American bandit air force has a variety of modern supersonic aircraft, such as "Thunderchiefs," "Phantoms," and so on. The Party branch raised this question to the comrades: "When the enemy comes, can we defeat them?" All the Party members in this battalion unanimously answered: "Rifles, militias, and self-defense forces have shot down American planes, and our air force has modern weapons. No matter what kind of planes the American imperialists have, we will shoot them down! Equipment and technology are important, but it is people who determine victory! In the instant of a face-to-face impact, it will be the cowardly American pilots who lose their lives." Obviously, what they said has now been confirmed!
    To shoot down enemy planes, determination and courage are not enough. Although our air force is still in its infancy, it has our Party's invincible military line to guide it to victory. The soldiers of the First Battalion have mastered the operational guiding principle of "using the few to defeat the many, using the weak to defeat the strong," and constantly work hard to improve their tactics and technology. The "Diligent Study and Hard Practice" movement, the "Offer Suggestions and Ideas" movement, and so on, are being carried out vigorously in the First Battalion. Whether before meals, before going to bed, or when sitting in the combat duty room or under the wings of the planes waiting for take-off to fight, the comrades often talk about ways to annihilate the enemy and win victory. Where will the enemy come from, and how should we deal with them? What should we do if we are surrounded by the enemy? At any time, any complicated question raised by a comrade will arouse heated discussions among everyone. We have seen them engrossed in heated debates during breaks in political study; small silver airplane models held between their fingers, sometimes rising high, sometimes turning left, sometimes turning right, and flying swiftly. Beside the sand table, beside the blackboard crisscrossed with green and yellow chalk lines, they often argued. To actively strike the enemy and achieve victory, we must discover the enemy as early as possible. Whenever they see birds flying across the sky or butterflies fluttering from the grass beside the airport, they always stare at them intently until they are completely out of sight. Whenever they meet, as long as a comrade suddenly shakes a model of an enemy plane quickly, others must immediately say what type it is, its speed, and its performance, without the slightest hesitation. Now, many brave, bold, and resourceful tactics of the First Battalion have been affirmed by the higher authorities.
    "To adopt the tactics of the Vietnamese People's Air Force, we must have truly Vietnamese-style technical training methods." Our air force's training is closely integrated with the actual combat on the Vietnamese battlefield. What is needed in combat is trained first. Others often judge whether a pilot is proficient only based on the number of his flight hours. But for us, flight hours are only one aspect of the problem. In a poor country, in the spirit of "building the army through diligence and thrift," our air force soldiers overcome technical weaknesses by "hard practice" on the ground. Some comrades practiced driving techniques in the cockpit so hard that they even forgot to eat, until their comrades searched everywhere and found them. In order to develop a light driving technique like "a young girl embroidering," they rolled up a newspaper, held it, and pushed it back and forth without allowing it to be flattened. Whenever they can seize something that can be used for training, they will never let it go. In the movement to establish "Four Good Branches," the branch made a resolution: "Four good party members must defeat any enemy in the sky, so they must actively train on the ground." It is precisely because of hard practice that some complex subjects, which according to book theory would take a year to learn, were mastered by the pilots of the First Battalion in only two months. Some comrades have also successfully mastered extremely complex landing methods that the air force had never heard of before. You must know that every pilot here comes from a peasant background. Recalling those days when they first joined the air force, terms like "friction" and "jet" were so unfamiliar to them! But today, they are skillfully piloting jet planes, pouncing on groups of American planes like Wu Song fighting a tiger, causing the enemy to lose their souls.
    On April 4th last year, the First Battalion achieved brilliant combat exploits in its first battle in the high skies of Thanh Hoa province. Since then, every time they encountered the enemy in an attack, they achieved glorious victories as soon as they opened fire. They have made further improvements in tactics and technology, and their determination to fight has become even stronger. Now, taking off to fight has become every comrade's urgent wish. In the fierce battles with the American bandit planes, the comrades are always closely united. The soldiers of our Air Force First Battalion always encourage and cover each other when fighting in the sky. In every air battle, their voices can be heard in the command post:
    "Number ×, attack with confidence! I'm covering you from behind."
    Up to now, all the comrades in this battalion have been commended. The entire battalion has been awarded six first-class merit medals, six second-class merit medals, and many other medals.
    The First Battalion, together with the military and civilians of the whole country, has made a glorious contribution to burying "American air superiority."
    The Battle of Annihilating the "Phantoms"
    [Vietnam] Century
    Two red flares shot into the sky like arrows. In an instant, the roar of engines sounded. The planes rushed forward violently, slid across the runway, and then quickly soared into the air.
    "Phoenix, pay attention! Phoenix, pay attention! Enemy ahead! Enemy ahead!" On the ground, the command post told them that they were approaching the enemy. A Lin shouted excitedly, "Understood!" Then reminded the entire formation to be vigilant when flying out of the clouds.
    In the clouds, A Lin clearly heard the excited and jubilant voices of his comrades. At this moment, when they were about to engage the enemy in a face-to-face contest, when they were about to fire shells of hatred at the enemy, everyone felt extremely excited. The bright sky gradually unfolded before them. A Lin had just glanced around his formation when he heard A Chen's report:
    "Enemy on the left, below, and behind!"
    A Lin turned his head and found a batch of enemy planes above him as well. He knew that his formation was at a disadvantage from the start. He had to quickly, flexibly, and decisively reverse the situation!
    "Drop the auxiliary fuel tanks! Accelerate! Attack!" A Lin said decisively to his comrades. The entire formation turned sharply to the left and pounced on the enemy's aircraft with overwhelming force. The enemy planes, which had been secretly complacent, thinking that they could unexpectedly take a bite out of us, were immediately panicked and fled in all directions. A Chen was chasing one of them closely. This enemy plane rose straight up, then immediately turned its head in a panic and drilled straight down to escape. At this time, another of our planes was also chasing an air bandit. A volley of dense shells flying from our plane quickly covered this "Phantom." The enemy plane lost its balance and swayed. "Well done! Stick to it!" However, at this moment, A Chen discovered that another "Phantom" enemy plane was secretly circling behind, attempting to attack his comrade. He rushed forward without hesitation to cover his comrade. Seeing the situation was not good, this "Phantom" fled in a hurry. A Chen was not willing to let the opportunity pass, and he pursued closely. The enemy plane fled desperately along the Ma River towards the sea, dragging a red trail of fire behind its tail. In the cockpit, A Chen couldn't help laughing out loud: "Good! Look at this American devil, even when no one is chasing him, he still runs for his life!" It seems that the "speed advantage" that the American devils have always boasted about for the "Phantom" is only for their escape. A Lin was extremely excited. How brave his comrades were in battle! In less than two rounds, his formation had already seized the initiative, beating the enemy, who outnumbered them, into a mess and fleeing in all directions!
    "Pay attention to coordinated operations! Open fire when you are close to the enemy!" A Lin reminded his comrades.
    At this time, A Lin saw an enemy plane rushing towards one of our planes. A Lin made a sharp turn and pounced head-on at the enemy plane, scaring the enemy plane into turning around and running. A Lin had just turned his head when he saw another enemy plane flying past in front of him. He immediately chased after it. Closer! Closer! So that he could aim at the head of the American bandit shaking in the cockpit and fire fiercely, smashing him to pieces! The enemy plane was finally hit, its tail cocked up, and it swayed a few times before falling down!
    The battle ended victoriously. The order to return to base came from the ground. The enemy planes had fled without a trace. The entire formation was filled with the joy of victory, riding the long wind, and returned to base.

    新生力量是从艰苦斗争中锻炼出来的
    英雄大队的成长
    〔越南〕  清流
    “四○九！黎明！”
    随即，指挥台的无线电里传来空中的回答：
    “四○九，知道啦！”
    高空中，一架架喷气式战斗机如象一只只银燕，划破云层，逐渐地降落，轻捷地滑过跑道。……
    我们的空军第一大队诞生在美国强盗天天出动空军在我国散布死亡和苦难的时刻，在它的身上，有着英雄的越南人民军队决战决胜的传统。这一决战精神来自对美国强盗的血海深仇。一次又一次对美国强盗罪行的控诉，使所有的同志更加相互了解和情逾骨肉。这个大队所有的战士，都有亲人惨遭帝国主义的屠杀。对于美帝国主义的仇恨，以及抗美救国保卫北方、支持南方解放的革命斗争的神圣任务，锻炼了同志们消灭敌人的钢铁意志。在过去的日子里，他们多么希望能有一天驾着飞机，冲上去把敌机打个粉碎呵！
    愿望，今天终于变成现实了。党，已经交给他们一架架喷气歼击机，并对他们寄予深深的信赖。他们呢，决不辜负这一种信赖。
    在革命军队里，无论哪一个兵种，当它刚成立时，总是弱于敌人的。美国强盗空军拥有多种现代化超音速飞机，什么“雷公式”啦，“鬼怪式”啦，等等。党支部给同志们提出了这个问题：“敌人来了，我们能够战胜它吗？”这个大队的全体党员都一致回答：“步枪、民兵、自卫队还打下了美国的飞机，咱们空军拥有现代化武器，不管美帝国主义的什么飞机，都要把它揍下来！装备和技术是重要的，但是决定胜利的是人！在面对面冲击的一瞬间，丧命的必是贪生怕死的美国飞行员。”显然，他们说的这些话，现在已被证实了！
    要把敌机揍下来，有了决心和勇敢精神还是不够的。我们的空军，虽然还处在幼年时期，但是却有我们党的无敌的军事路线，把它引导到胜利。第一大队的战士们掌握了“以少胜多、以弱胜强”的作战指导原则，不断苦练战术，技术。“勤学苦练”运动、“出谋献策”运动等等，在第一大队热火朝天地开展起来。无论是在进餐前，就寝前，或是当坐在战斗值班室和机翼下面待命起飞战斗的时候，同志们经常都在谈论歼敌制胜的方法。敌人从那一边来，该怎么对付？陷入敌人包围时，怎么办？任何时候，任何一个同志提出来的复杂问题，都会引起大伙热烈的讨论。我们曾经看到他们沉迷在政治学习间隙的热烈争论里；夹在他们手指中的小巧的银色飞机模型，时而高升，时而左拐，时而右转地急速飞掠。在沙盘旁边，在纵横交错地划满一条条绿色和黄色粉笔道道的黑板旁，他们经常争论着。要想主动地打击敌人，取得胜利，就得及早发现敌人。每当看见鸟儿从天空掠过，蝴蝶从机场旁边的草丛中展翅飞起，他们总是那样立即紧紧地盯着它们，直到完全看不见为止。无论什么时候碰见，只要一个同志突然把一只敌机模型急速地一晃，其他的人就得马上说出它是什么类型、它的速度和性能，而不得有片刻的迟疑。现在，第一大队许多勇敢、大胆、机智的打法，已被上级所肯定。
    “要想采用越南人民空军的战术，就得有真正越南式的技术训练方法。”我们空军的训练与越南战场的实际战斗紧密结合。战斗需要的，先训练。别人看一个飞行员是否熟练，经常只是根据他的飞行时数的多少。但对于我们，飞行时数只是问题的一个方面。在一个穷国，本着“勤俭建军”的精神，我们的空军战士们以在地面“苦练”的方法克服了技术上的弱点。有的同志在机舱中苦练驾驶技术甚至忘记了吃饭，直到同志们找来找去，才找到他。为了练就一手“少女绣花”般的轻巧驾驶技术，他们把一张报纸卷起来，拿着它推来推去而不许把它捏扁。无论在什么时候，只要能抓住什么可以锻炼的东西，他们绝不会放过。在建立“四好支部”运动中，支部作出了决议：“四好党员在天上必须战胜任何敌人，因此在地面时就得积极锻炼。”正是由于苦练，有些复杂的课目，根据书本理论要学一年的时间，但第一大队的飞行员们只用两个月的时间就达到了要求。有些同志又成功地掌握了空军军种从未听人谈过的极其复杂的着陆方法。要知道，这里的每一个飞行员都是农民出身。回想刚刚参加空军部队的那些日子，“摩擦”、“喷气”等名词，对于他们也是多么陌生呵！但今天，他们已经熟练地驾驶着喷气式飞机，象武松打虎般直扑美国飞机群，使敌人丧魂失魄。
    去年四月四日，第一大队在清化省高空初次战斗就立下了辉煌的战功。从那时以来，每次出击遇到敌人，他们一开炮就取得光辉的胜利。他们在战术、技术方面已经有了进一步提高，战斗的决心也更加坚强了。现在，起飞战斗已经成为每个同志迫切的愿望。在与美国强盗飞机进行的激烈战斗中，同志们总是紧密地团结。我们空军第一大队的战士们在天空战斗时，总是互相鼓舞，互相掩护。无论哪一次空战，在指挥所里都能听到他们相互的声音：
    “×号，放心攻击！我在后面掩护你。”
    截至目前为止，这个大队的所有同志都受到了表扬。整个大队获得了六个一级战功勋章，六个二级战功勋章和许多别的勋章。
    第一大队与全国军民一起，为埋葬“美国空中优势”作出了光辉的贡献。
    痛歼“鬼怪”的战斗
    〔越南〕  世纪
    两发红色信号弹象箭一样升上天空。刹那间，响起了隆隆的马达声。飞机猛烈往前冲，在跑道上滑过，然后就急速地腾空而起。
    “凤凰注意！凤凰注意！前面出现敌人！前面出现敌人！”地面上，指挥所告诉他们已经接近敌人了。阿林兴奋地大声喊叫起来：“知道啦！”随即提醒整个编队在飞出云层时注意警戒。
    在云层里，阿林清楚地听到战友们兴奋欢腾的声音。在这就要与敌人进行面对面地较量的时刻，将要把仇恨的炮弹射向敌人的时刻，人们不约而同地感到万分兴奋。明亮的天空逐渐展现在面前。阿林刚刚环视一下自己的编队，就听到了阿陈的报告：
    “左边、下面和后面有敌人！”
    阿林回过头来，发现头上也有一批敌机。他知道，自己的编队一开始就处于不利的地位。必须迅速、灵活和果敢地扭转局势！
    “扔掉副油箱！加速！攻击！”阿林斩钉截铁地对战友说。整个编队急促地左转，以雷霆万钧之势向敌人的机群猛扑。本来正在暗地得意，以为将能出其不意地偷咬我们一口的敌机，这时却立即惊慌失措起来，四散奔逃。阿陈紧追着其中一架。这架敌机直往上升，然后又立即慌忙地倒头，直往下钻，逃跑了。这时，我们的另一架飞机也正追逐着一个空中强盗。从我们的飞机上飞出的一排密集的炮弹，迅即罩住了这只“鬼怪”。敌机失去平衡，摇晃起来。“打得好！紧紧咬住它！”可是，就在这时刻，阿陈发现另一只“鬼怪式”敌机正在偷偷地绕到后边，妄图袭击自己的战友。他毫不迟疑地驾机冲上前去为战友掩护。这架“鬼怪式”见势不妙，慌忙逃跑。阿陈哪肯放过时机，他紧紧追击。敌机沿着马江，拼死拼活地向海面逃遁，屁股上拖着一道红色的火光。在机舱里，阿陈禁不住放声大笑起来：“好哇！看这美国鬼子，没人追了还要没命地逃跑！”看来，美国鬼子一直吹嘘的“鬼怪式”的速度“优势”，只不过是便于他们脱身逃命而已。阿林兴奋异常。他的战友在战斗中多勇敢呵！还不到两个回合，他的编队已经夺得了主动，把数量多于自己的敌人打得满天乱窜，四散逃命！
    “注意协同作战！靠近敌人再开火！”阿林提醒战友们。
    这时候，阿林看见一架敌机冲向我们的一架飞机。阿林一个急转弯，向敌机迎头扑去，吓得敌机掉头就跑。阿林刚回过头，又看到另一架敌机在面前飞过。他立即追过去。近些！再近些！以便对准正在驾驶室中晃动的美国强盗的脑袋狠狠地开炮，把它打个粉身碎骨！敌机终于被打得翘起尾巴，摇摇晃晃地打了几个圈，掉下去了！
    战斗胜利结束。地面上传来返航的命令。敌机已逃得无影无踪。整个编队充满胜利的喜悦，乘着长风，返回基地。
                    （节译自四月四日越南《人民报》）
