    The Contrary Tune Sung by Demons and Monsters
    Dong Jia Geng, Captain of the Fourth Team, Ge Wu Commune, Donghuo Brigade, Yancheng County, Jiangsu Province

    In 1959, just as the Right opportunists were preparing to attack the Party, Comrade Wu Han wrote the poisonous article "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor," calling on people to promote the spirit of "daring to scold," to wave the flag and create an atmosphere for the emergence of Right opportunists. Sure enough, at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the Right opportunists launched a frenzied attack on the Party.

    Even more viciously, after the Party thoroughly smashed the conspiracy of the Right opportunists at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, their ambitions were not realized, and some were dismissed from their posts. Comrade Wu Han "broke out of the door" and threw out "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," encouraging the Right opportunists not to be discouraged, to regroup, and to attack the Party and socialism again. This is such a frenzied attempt, and we resolutely will not allow it to be realized!

    Above, when Comrade Wu Han and the Right opportunists echoed each other, attacking the Party and socialism, below, the demons and monsters responded to the call and came out one after another. Take our production team as an example. The class struggle and the struggle between the two roads are very fierce. For example, there is a landlord's wife in our village who dared to scold the Communist Party and socialism. At that time, our poor and lower-middle peasants resolutely fought against her and repelled her frenzied attack. It can be seen that Comrade Wu Han completely speaks with the same voice as the demons and monsters, singing a contrary tune.

    From the above situation, the overthrown reactionary classes are always unwilling to accept their demise and are constantly fighting against us, attempting to realize capitalist restoration. If they can't do it by force, they come with words; if they can't do it openly, they come secretly.

    We, the educated youth returning to the countryside, must be vigilant and stand the test of class struggle! We must not only care about the struggle for production, working hard with the poor and lower-middle peasants, cultivating the land with hoes and plows, to build a new socialist countryside, but also care about class struggle and actively participate in class struggle. If we only bury ourselves in production and ignore class struggle, a new socialist countryside cannot be built. We must always give prominence to politics, creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, put class struggle in the first place, not allow the anti-Party and anti-socialist Wu Han, Right opportunists, and all kinds of demons and monsters to take advantage of any opportunity, dig out the roots of revisionism, and carry the socialist revolution through to the end.

    牛鬼蛇神唱的反调
    江苏省盐城县葛武公社董伙大队四队队长　董加耕
    一九五九年，正当右倾机会主义分子准备向党进攻的时候，吴晗同志写出《海瑞骂皇帝》的恶毒文章，号召人们发扬“敢骂”精神，为右倾机会主义分子的出场，摇旗呐喊，制造气氛。果然，在党的八届八中全会上，右倾机会主义分子向党发动了猖狂进攻。
    更恶毒的，在党的八届八中全会上，右倾机会主义分子的阴谋被党彻底粉碎以后，他们的野心没有实现，有的被撤了职，吴晗同志就“破门而出”，抛出《海瑞罢官》，鼓励右倾机会主义分子不要灰心丧气，重整旗鼓，再向党向社会主义进攻。这是多么猖狂的企图，我们坚决不允许它实现！
    在上面，吴晗同志和右倾机会主义分子一唱一和，向党向社会主义进攻的时候，在下面，牛鬼蛇神响应号召，纷纷出笼。就拿我们生产队来说，阶级斗争和两条道路的斗争，是很激烈的。例如，我村有一个地主婆，竟敢大骂共产党，大骂社会主义。当时，我们贫下中农坚决和她作斗争，打退了她的猖狂进攻。可见，吴晗同志完全和牛鬼蛇神一个鼻孔出气，唱一个反调。
    从以上情况看来，被推翻的反动阶级，总是不甘心于他们的灭亡，时时向我们作斗争，企图实现资本主义复辟。他们武的不行，就来文的，明的不行，就来暗的。
    我们回乡的知识青年，千万要提高警惕，经得起阶级斗争的考验！我们既要关心生产斗争，和贫下中农一起辛勤劳动，一锄一犁地耕耘，来建设社会主义新农村，又要关心阶级斗争，积极参加阶级斗争。只顾埋头生产，不管阶级斗争，社会主义新农村是不可能建设起来的。我们要永远突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，把阶级斗争放在首要地位，不让反党反社会主义的吴晗、右倾机会主义分子、形形色色的牛鬼蛇神有可乘之机，挖掉修正主义的根子，把社会主义革命进行到底。
