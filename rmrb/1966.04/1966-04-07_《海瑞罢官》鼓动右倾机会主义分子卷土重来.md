    "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" Encourages Right-leaning Opportunists to Come Back
    Zhang Guomin
    Abstract: Hai Rui was dismissed from office twice in his life, but he never had the idea of "trying again after failing." Comrade Wu Han deliberately distorted historical facts, with the aim of encouraging the defeated right-leaning opportunists to continue to oppose the Party and socialism.
    In 1959, the Party achieved a significant victory in the struggle against right-leaning opportunism. Just when those self-proclaimed Hai Rui right-leaning opportunists were completely defeated and dismissed from their posts, why did Comrade Wu Han choose the subject of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," revise it seven times, and insist on it "breaking out of the door"? He said that the creation of historical dramas must be "closely integrated with current needs" and select "topics with practical significance." It seems that he himself did just that.
    The Party criticized those who claimed to be Hai Rui for opposing the people, and he tried his best to beautify Hai Rui as a "master for the people," "seeking benefits for the people," "eliminating harm for the people," and a "savior" of the working people "loved by the people." Those who claimed to be Hai Rui attacked the people's communes for "messing things up," and he wrote a lot about "the suffering and desolation of Jiangnan, the occupation of land will not last long if it is not returned," and "returning the land can make the people safe." The Party wanted those who claimed to be Hai Rui to confess their guilt, and he tried his best to promote "the old man's arrogance is still there, how can he bend his waist to flatter powerful ministers?" "A true man stands upright, why fear the disaster of being killed." Those who claimed to be Hai Rui were dismissed, and he said, "Conspiracy and frame-up are unreasonable," "Hai Rui's dismissal is fragrant," "His pure reputation will last forever." The Party victoriously crushed the attack of the right-leaning opportunists, and he vigorously advocated "not being frightened by failure, but trying again after failing."
    This is exactly singing a different tune from the Party. This is exactly "closely integrating" with the "current needs" of the right-leaning opportunists, speaking for them, supporting them, asking them to be stubborn to the end, regroup, and continue to oppose the Party, oppose the people, oppose socialism, and strive for the restoration of capitalism.
    What is particularly worth pointing out is that Comrade Wu Han deliberately distorted historical facts, emphasizing Hai Rui's "trying again after failing," his intention is very sinister. Hai Rui was dismissed from office twice in his life. One was when he was dismissed and imprisoned by Jiajing for submitting the "Security Statement." That time he was prepared to die, and being dismissed from office was even more expected. So this was voluntary, and it has nothing to do with "failure," let alone "trying again after failing." The other time was when he was serving as the governor of Ying Tian. In the "Report on Requesting Sick Leave" that he submitted when he was dismissed this time, he said: "Grant me to return to my hometown and return to the fields forever." At the same time, in a letter to Wu Shilai, the censor in charge of the river affairs, he said: "I have already prepared to return to the south, waiting for the gentlemen who come later, but I will not be involved. ... What kind of career can be accomplished in this world!" From this it can be seen that Hai Rui was both angry and discouraged when he was dismissed this time, and he did not have the idea of "trying again after failing." The reason why Comrade Wu Han wants to distort historical facts and emphasize "trying again after failing" is precisely to encourage those right-leaning opportunists who have failed to make a comeback and continue to oppose the Party and socialism. He now says that he is "completely for the sake of the ancient," and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" "cannot smell any atmosphere of the times," is just a clumsy excuse.

### 《海瑞罢官》鼓动右倾机会主义分子卷土重来

    《海瑞罢官》鼓动右倾机会主义分子卷土重来
    张国民
    提要　海瑞一生有两次罢官，但根本没有“失败了再干”的思想。吴晗同志蓄意歪曲史实，目的是鼓动失败了的右倾机会主义分子，继续反党反社会主义。
    一九五九年，在反右倾机会主义的斗争中，党取得了重大的胜利。正当那些自命海瑞的右倾机会主义分子彻底失败、被罢免撤职之时，吴晗同志为什么不写别的，偏偏要选中“海瑞罢官”这个题材，七易其稿，非“破门而出”不可呢？他说过，创作历史剧必须“密切结合当前需要”，选取“有现实意义的题材”。看来，他自己正是这样做的。
    党批判那些自命海瑞者反人民，他就竭力把海瑞美化成“为民作主”、“为民谋利”、“为民除害”、“受民爱戴”的劳动人民的“救星”。那些自命海瑞者攻击人民公社“搞糟了”，他就大写“江南困苦凄凉相，不退占田不久长”，“退田才能使民安”。党要那些自命海瑞者认罪，他就竭力鼓吹“老来傲骨犹然在，岂肯折腰媚权臣？”“大丈夫顶天立地，岂可怕杀身之祸”。那些自命海瑞者被撤了职，他就说“阴谋陷害理不当”，“海瑞罢官姓名香”，“清名千古永流芳”。党胜利地粉碎了右倾机会主义者的进攻，他就大肆鼓吹“不为失败所吓倒，失败了再干”。
    这正是同党唱对台戏。这正是“密切结合”右倾机会主义者的“当前需要”，替他们说话，给他们撑腰，要他们顽固到底，重整旗鼓，继续反党、反人民、反社会主义，为复辟资本主义而奋斗。
    尤其值得指出的是，吴晗同志蓄意歪曲史实，强调海瑞“失败了再干”，其居心是十分险恶的。海瑞一生有两次罢官。一次是上《治安疏》被嘉靖罢官下狱。那次他连死都准备好了，罢官更是意料中事。所以这是心甘情愿的，扯不上“失败”，更扯不上“失败了再干”的问题。另一次是任应天巡抚时。他在这次被罢黜时所上的《告养病疏》中说：“赐臣回籍，永归田里。”同时在给操江御史吴时来的信中说：“生已促装南归，以俟后之君子，而生不与矣。……这等世界，做得成甚事业！”由此可见，海瑞在这次罢官时只是既愤懑而又灰心丧气，根本没有“失败了再干”的思想。吴晗同志之所以要歪曲史实，强调“失败了再干”，正是为了鼓动那些失败了的右倾机会主义者卷土重来，继续反党反社会主义。他现在说自己“完全是为古而古”，“《海瑞罢官》却一点时代气息也闻不到了”，只不过是笨拙的遁辞罢了。
