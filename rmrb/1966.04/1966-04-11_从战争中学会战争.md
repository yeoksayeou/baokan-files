    Learn War Through War
    He Jiang
    Whenever the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America take up arms to make revolution, the imperialists and reactionaries of various countries often slander China, saying that it is incited by China, or even organized by China. After the publication of Comrade Lin Biao's article "Long Live the Victory of People's War," they attacked China even more vehemently as "warlike," saying that China calls for "using force and violence to change the world order." Gentlemen, you are wrong. It is you who have forced the oppressed people and oppressed nations to take up arms to seek their own liberation; it is you who have taught them.
    When people of various countries begin to make revolution, they are often empty-handed. However, as soon as they "stir up" a little trouble, the imperialists and reactionaries arrest the revolutionaries, beheading and shooting them. There is a Chinese saying, "Driven to join the Liangshan rebels." The surviving revolutionaries, if not intimidated by the enemy, and if they want to continue the revolution, have no other way out than to take up arms and fight the enemy.
    Roads are made by people. The road of armed struggle is also pioneered by revolutionaries of various countries themselves.
    The Chinese people did not understand the importance of guns to the revolution at the beginning. In 1927, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries massively slaughtered Communists and revolutionary people, which made us understand: the enemy has a knife in his hand, and the people should also take up a knife. Comrade Mao Zedong summarized this historical experience in vivid and popular language. He wrote: "We are acting according to Chiang Kai-shek's method." "Seeing that others have something in their hands, we must investigate. What is he holding? It's a knife. What is the use of a knife? It can kill people. Who does he want to kill with the knife? He wants to kill the people. After investigating these things, investigate further: The Chinese people also have hands and can also hold a knife, and if they don't have a knife, they can forge one. After a long period of investigation and research, the Chinese people discovered this truth."
    The Chinese people, the Vietnamese people, the Korean people, and the Algerian people have traveled this road. Today, the people of Congo (L), the people of "Portuguese" Guinea, the people of Angola, the people of Mozambique, the people of Colombia, the people of Peru..., are also taking this road.
    From not understanding the importance of guns to understanding the importance of guns; from not engaging in armed struggle to carrying out armed struggle, this is a leap in understanding and practice.
    However, in the early stages of armed struggle, even in a considerably long period, the revolutionary army is always weak, while the counter-revolutionary army is strong. To eliminate an enemy that is several times or dozens of times stronger than oneself, without being eliminated by the enemy, it is also necessary to solve the problem of strategy and tactics.
    The strategy and tactics of the revolutionary army will not fall from the sky, but can only be summarized from one's own experience through practice. The strategy and tactics of the Chinese people's revolutionary war were produced in this way.
    When the Chinese people began to engage in armed struggle, the number of revolutionary armed forces was small and the weapons were very poor. Fighting means preserving oneself and eliminating the enemy. The life-and-death struggle forces out a set of effective military principles. The enemy wants to eliminate us, they have more people, they come, we leave. When they settle down, we harass them and prevent them from resting well. After exhausting the enemy, we choose a favorable opportunity to attack them and wipe out a part of them. When they are exhausted and retreat to their nests, we wait for them in full strength and take the opportunity to pursue them. "The enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue." The guerrilla tactics of the Chinese people's armed forces gradually formed in practice.
    For the revolutionary army to grow from small to large, from weak to strong, it must win more battles and lose fewer battles. The enemy has more people, so I leave so they can't hit me. I don't fight battles I'm not sure of, and I don't fight unprepared battles; when I want to fight the enemy, I must hit accurately and hard, using three to five times the enemy's strength, and fight quickly to annihilate one enemy after another. This is the secret to our fighting, which is the strategy of people's war. Comrade Mao Zedong summarized it as: "You fight your way, I fight my way; fight if you can win, and leave if you can't." The Chinese people have fought for decades, and that is how they fought.
    The only way for the revolutionary armed forces to win the final victory of the struggle is to launch a people's war, rely closely on the people, unite the people, and apply and develop the strategy and tactics of revolutionary war according to the specific conditions of their own country. Revolutionary war is a matter for the people themselves. They do not undergo formal training first, or go to advanced military schools to study, and then carry out armed struggle, but rather take up weapons, learn while doing, and learn while doing. In this regard, the enemy is the best teacher for the people's armed forces. It is impossible in fact to demand that the revolutionary armed forces win every battle. We can only ask to win more battles, lose fewer battles, or lose fewer unprofitable battles. If we win a battle, we summarize the successful experience. If we lose a battle, we summarize the lessons of failure. With positive and negative experiences, we can learn how to fight. Imperialism and all reactionaries, equipped with modern weapons, will ultimately be defeated by the revolutionary armed forces of the people.

    从战争中学会战争
    何江
    亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的人民一拿起枪杆子来闹革命，帝国主义和各国反动派常常诬蔑中国，说这是中国煽动的，甚至是中国组织的。林彪同志的《人民战争胜利万岁》一文发表后，它们更是大肆攻击中国“好战”，说什么中国号召“用武力和暴力来改变世界秩序”。先生们，你们错了。被压迫人民和被压迫民族拿起武器来谋求自己的解放，是你们逼出来的，是你们教会他们的。
    各国人民开始起来搞革命的时候，往往是赤手空拳。但是，刚“闹”一点事，帝国主义和反动派就把革命者抓起来，砍头、枪毙。中国有句俗语，叫做“逼上梁山”。幸存下来的革命者，如果没有被敌人吓倒，如果还要继续搞革命，除了拿起枪杆子来同敌人斗争以外，没有别的出路。
    路，是人走出来的。武装斗争的这条道路，也是各国革命者自己闯出来的。
    中国人民开始并不懂得枪杆子对革命的重要性。一九二七年，蒋介石反动派大肆屠杀共产党人和革命人民，使我们懂得：敌人手里拿着刀，人民也应当拿起刀来。毛泽东同志以生动和通俗的语言，总结了这一历史经验。他写道：“我们是按照蒋介石的办法办事。”“看到人家手里拿着东西了，我们就要调查一下。他手里拿的是什么？是刀。刀有什么用处？可以杀人。他要拿刀杀谁？要杀人民。调查了这几件事，再调查一下：中国人民也有手，也可以拿刀，没有刀可以打一把。中国人民经过长期的调查研究，发现了这个真理。”
    这一条路，中国人民、越南人民、朝鲜人民、阿尔及利亚人民，曾经走过。今天刚果（利）人民、“葡属”几内亚人民、安哥拉人民、莫三鼻给人民、哥伦比亚人民、秘鲁人民……，也正在走。
    从不懂得枪杆子的重要，到懂得枪杆子的重要；从不搞武装斗争到进行武装斗争，这是认识上、也是实践上的一个飞跃。
    但是，在武装斗争的初期，甚至可以说，在相当长的时期内，革命军队总是弱小的，而反革命军队则是强大的。要消灭比自己强大几倍、几十倍的敌人，而不被敌人所消灭，还要解决战略战术的问题。
    革命军队的战略战术，不会从天上掉下来，只能通过实践，从自己的经验中总结出来。中国人民革命战争的战略战术，就是这样产生的。
    中国人民在开始进行武装斗争的时候，革命武装人数不多，武器也很差。打仗，就是要保存自己，消灭敌人。你死我活的斗争，逼出一套行之有效的军事原则来。敌人要消灭我们，他们人多，他们来了，我们就走。等到他们住下来，我们就进行袭扰，不让他们好好休息。把敌人拖疲劳了，我们就选择有利时机，打它一下，吃掉它一部。他们精疲力竭，收兵回巢，我们就以逸待劳，乘机追击。“敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追。”中国人民武装的游击战术，就是这样在实践的过程中逐步形成起来的。
    革命军队要由小变大，由弱变强，就要多打胜仗，少打败仗。敌人人多，我就走，使他们打不到。我不打无把握之仗，不打无准备之仗；我要打敌人，就一定要打得准打得狠，以三倍五倍于敌的优势兵力，速战速决，打一个又一个的歼灭战。这就是我们打仗的诀窍，也就是人民战争的战略。毛泽东同志把它概括为：“你打你的，我打我的；打得赢就打，打不赢就走。”中国人民打了几十年的仗，就是这样打的。
    革命的武装要赢得斗争的最后胜利，唯一的办法，就是发动人民战争，紧紧地依靠人民、团结人民，并且根据本国的具体情况，运用和发展革命战争的战略战术。革命战争是人民群众自己的事情。他们不是先经过正规的训练，或者先进军事学校去学习，再进行武装斗争，而是拿起武器，边干边学，干起来再学习。在这方面，敌人是人民武装的最好的教员。要求革命武装每仗必胜，这在事实上是不可能的。只能要求多打胜仗，少打败仗或少打得不偿失的仗。打了胜仗，就总结成功的经验。打了败仗，就总结失败的教训。有了正反两方面的经验，就能够学会打仗的本领。有着现代化武器装备的帝国主义和一切反动派，到头来都必将被人民的革命武装所打败。
