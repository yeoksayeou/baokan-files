    From Loving the Emperor to Cursing the Emperor
      Tianjin Second Printing and Dyeing Factory　Li Peijiang
    I heard Wu Han speak in Tianjin once. He said, "We cannot simply shout 'Down with them!' and start cursing whenever we see slave owners, landlords, or the bourgeoisie in history. We cannot engage in indiscriminate and unprincipled cursing. We must curse the backward and overthrow the backward, but we must never curse or overthrow the progressive." He even said, "Any emperor who can put the country's politics on the right track, stabilize the people's lives, and continuously develop and improve production is a good emperor."
    Look! How much poison Wu Han peddled in Tianjin! How blatant his theory of class reconciliation is! From this, we can see how deep his feelings are for emperors, kings, generals, and ministers! He shouted loudly for the emperor, telling the people not to overthrow them, as if emperors, kings, generals, and ministers could also represent the interests of the people, as if society would develop and the people would be happy as long as there were good officials and good emperors! This is like daydreaming and deliberately turning black and white upside down. Open the history books of the old society spanning thousands of years and see which dynasty did not have the ruling class riding on the backs of the people, and which moment did not have the class struggle of the oppressed people seeking liberation! All crows are black, and there is simply no such thing as a good emperor in the world. Who says the old society was good? The feudal landlords and the bourgeoisie, not the working people. Wu Han says they were good, which shows that Wu Han is sitting on the same bench with these people. Wu Han wants to obliterate the sharp class struggle, preventing us from overthrowing emperors, kings, generals, and ministers, and wanting us to be beasts of burden for generations. It is simply wishful thinking! What Comrade Wu Han peddles is entirely the politics of the feudal landlord class and the bourgeoisie.
    In Wu Han's report, the entire content is about the merits of emperors, kings, generals, and ministers, as if only emperors, kings, generals, and ministers can enable production to develop and improve. This is a distortion of history. History is created by the working people, and everything in society is created by the working people. All experience in the struggle for production is the result of labor. Those emperors, kings, generals, and ministers who eat human flesh and drink human blood only exploit the people. We will never allow Wu Han to beautify emperors, kings, generals, and ministers and to uglify the working people.
    From Wu Han's report in Tianjin, we can clearly see that he only has emperors, kings, generals, and ministers in his eyes and no working people at all. In 1959, Wu Han, who had consistently praised emperors, suddenly began to curse the emperor. How can this be explained? If we connect it with the specific circumstances at the time, we will know what medicine he is selling in his gourd. The emperor that Comrade Wu Han "cursed" was precisely our Party. At that time, a small handful of right-leaning opportunists were active, preparing to attack the Party and curse our great Party. It was also at this time that Comrade Wu Han's "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" was born. Wu Han, who had always loved the emperor, actually cursed the emperor, and "cursed very happily." As long as we look at it with a class analysis perspective, we can immediately see the conspiracy. It was not Hai Rui who was cursing the emperor, but Wu Han was subtly alluding, using the past to satirize the present. The historical Hai Rui did not curse the emperor; it was Wu Han who cursed our beloved Party.
    As a worker, I will never allow anyone to wildly attack the Party, the people, or socialism. We must stand up, safeguard the interests of the Party and the interests of socialism, and defend Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. We must firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, this invincible weapon, and sweep away all the demons and monsters of capitalism and feudalism!

### 从爱皇帝到骂皇帝

    从爱皇帝到骂皇帝
      天津第二印染厂　李培江
    我听过吴晗在天津的一次讲话，他说：“不能一见到历史上的奴隶主、地主、资产阶级等，就笼统地喊打倒，大骂起来。我们不能无是无非的谩骂。我们要骂落后的，打倒落后的，绝不许连进步的也骂，也打倒。”还说什么“每一个皇帝只要能使国家的政治上轨道，老百姓的生活安定，生产不断地发展和提高，就是好皇帝”。
    看！吴晗在天津贩了多么大的毒！他的阶级调和论多露骨！从这里又可以看出他对帝王将相的感情有多深！他为皇帝大喊大叫，让人民别打倒他们，好象帝王将相也可以代表人民的利益，好象只要有个好官、好皇帝，社会就会发展，人民就会幸福！真是白日里说梦话，故意颠倒黑白。翻开旧社会几千年的历史看看，那朝那代不是统治阶级骑在人民头上作威作福，那时那刻没有被压迫人民求解放的阶级斗争！天下乌鸦一般黑，世界上根本没有什么好皇帝。什么人说旧社会好？是封建地主、资产阶级，不是劳动人民。吴晗同志说他们好，说明吴晗和这些人坐在一条板凳上。吴晗想抹煞尖锐的阶级斗争，让我们不要打倒帝王将相，世世代代当牛马，简直是痴心妄想！吴晗同志贩卖的完全是封建地主阶级、资产阶级的政治。
    在吴晗的报告里，通篇讲的是帝王将相的功劳，好象只有帝王将相才能使生产发展和提高。这是对历史的歪曲。历史是劳动人民创造的，社会上一切都是劳动人民创造的。一切生产斗争的经验都是劳动的结果。那些吃人肉喝人血的帝王将相只会剥削人民。我们决不允许吴晗美化帝王将相，丑化劳动人民。
    从吴晗在天津的报告中，可以清清楚楚地看出来，他眼睛里只有帝王将相，根本没有劳动人民。一九五九年，一贯对皇帝歌功颂德的吴晗忽然骂起皇帝来了。这怎么解释呢？我们把它和当时的具体情况联系起来看一看，就知道他葫芦里装的什么药了。吴晗同志“骂”的正是我们党。那时候，一小撮右倾机会主义者正在活动，准备向党进攻，骂我们伟大的党。也正是在这个时候，吴晗同志的《海瑞骂皇帝》出笼了，一向爱皇帝的吴晗竟大骂起皇帝来，而且“骂得非常之痛快”。只要用阶级分析的眼光一看，一下子就可看出其中的阴谋。不是海瑞在骂皇帝，是吴晗含沙射影，借古非今。历史上的海瑞并没骂皇帝，是吴晗骂了我们敬爱的党。
    作为一个工人，我决不允许任何人向党、向人民、向社会主义猖狂进攻。我们要站出来，维护党的利益、社会主义的利益，捍卫马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。我们要紧紧掌握住毛泽东思想这个战无不胜的武器，把那些资本主义、封建主义的妖魔鬼怪统统扫清！
