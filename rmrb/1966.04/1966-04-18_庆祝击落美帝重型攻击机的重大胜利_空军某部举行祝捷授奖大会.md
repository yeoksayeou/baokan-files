    Celebrating the Great Victory of Shooting Down a US Imperialist Heavy Attack Aircraft
    Air Force Unit Holds Victory Celebration and Award Ceremony
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 17th: An air force unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army solemnly held a victory celebration and award ceremony in a certain area of Guangdong Province on the afternoon of the 16th, warmly celebrating the great victory of shooting down a US imperialist A-3B heavy attack aircraft over the Leizhou Peninsula area on the 12th, and rewarding units and personnel who had contributed to the battle. More than a thousand soldiers and civilians attending the conference unanimously expressed that they would resolutely continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, give prominence to politics, strengthen combat readiness, eliminate all enemy aircraft that dared to invade, and strive for greater victories in the struggle to defend the motherland's airspace and shatter the war provocations of US imperialism.
    Cao Lihuai, Deputy Commander of the Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Yan Fusheng,负责人 of the Guangzhou Military Region, Yin Linping, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and responsible persons of the local Party, government, and army attended the conference.
    At the meeting, Long Daoquan,负责人 of the Air Force of the Guangzhou Military Region, read out the commendation order from Lin Biao, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense, praising the units that had contributed to the battle. Amidst warm applause, Cao Lihuai and Long Daoquan presented certificates and prizes to representatives of meritorious units and individuals.
    Cao Lihuai spoke at the conference, extending warm congratulations to the units and personnel who had contributed to the battle of shooting down the US imperialist A-3B heavy attack aircraft. He said that after our government had issued a total of 400 serious warnings against the intrusion of US ships and aircraft into our territorial waters and airspace, US imperialism blatantly sent its heavy attack aircraft to intrude into the airspace over our mainland to conduct military provocation activities. This is a blatant violation of our country's airspace sovereignty and a serious step taken by US imperialism, while intensifying its war of aggression against Vietnam, in an attempt to impose the war on the heads of the Chinese people. Your action of shooting down the enemy aircraft that invaded our airspace in one fell swoop is a head-on blow to the rampant war provocations of US imperialism, which is addicted to aggression.
    Cao Lihuai strongly condemned US imperialism for increasingly frantically expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam, frequently sending warships and aircraft to intrude into China's territorial waters and airspace, and American aerial bandits for constantly trailing and attacking our fishing boats and merchant ships on the high seas, killing and wounding our fishermen. He solemnly warned the American aggressors: the Chinese people are not to be insulted, and China's airspace is sacred and inviolable. We are prepared for any provocation by US imperialism. If the American bandits dare to invade, we will resolutely fight. Whether you instigate lackeys and running dogs to come, or come in person, you will not escape the fate of being annihilated.
    Cao Lihuai said that our air force units shoulder the glorious task of defending the motherland's airspace. We must continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement Comrade Lin Biao's five principles on giving prominence to politics, conscientiously sum up the experience of this battle, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, heighten vigilance, strengthen combat readiness, and be ready at all times to strike down enemy aircraft that dare to invade, and strive for greater victories.
    Yin Linping, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, warmly congratulated the victory of this air battle in his speech, and called on people from all walks of life in Guangdong Province to conscientiously learn from the experience of the air force units participating in the war in holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, giving prominence to politics, and adhering to the "Four Firsts," unite as one, follow Chairman Mao's teachings on the idea of people's war, and strive to do a good job in socialist revolution and various production and construction tasks, make militia work better and better, and implement it more thoroughly, and build the southeast coast into an iron Great Wall, vowing to be the backing of the People's Liberation Army.
    Yan Fusheng,负责人 of the Guangzhou Military Region, in his speech, called on the broad masses of commanders and fighters of the army, navy, and air force on the southeast front to regard Chairman Mao's books as the highest instruction for all our work, heighten vigilance a hundredfold, strengthen combat readiness, and be ready at all times to make our contribution to completely burying the American aggressors who dare to invade.
    Yang Quanjian, representative of the combat unit, expressed his heartfelt thanks to the Party and the state for giving them this lofty honor and encouragement in his speech. He said that we must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching that "modesty helps one to progress, while arrogance makes one lag behind," be conscientious and never complacent, always give prominence to politics, always give prominence to Mao Zedong Thought, carry out political and ideological work in a thorough and solid manner, and repeatedly implement the five principles put forward by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, truly implement them to the grassroots level, truly implement them to every link, truly implement them to every person, make all combat readiness work better and more solid, and use new victories to answer the care of the Party and the people.

    庆祝击落美帝重型攻击机的重大胜利
    空军某部举行祝捷授奖大会
    新华社广州十七日电　中国人民解放军空军某部，十六日下午在广东省某地隆重举行祝捷授奖大会，热烈庆祝十二日在雷州半岛地区上空击落美帝国主义A—3B重型攻击机的重大胜利，奖励作战有功的单位和人员。出席大会的一千多军民一致表示，坚决继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，加强战备，消灭敢于来犯的一切敌机，在保卫祖国领空和粉碎美帝国主义的战争挑衅的斗争中，争取更大的胜利。
    中国人民解放军空军副司令员曹里怀，广州部队负责人晏福生，中共广东省委书记处书记尹林平，以及当地党、政府、军队的负责人等出席了大会。
    会上，广州部队空军负责人龙道权宣读了国务院副总理兼国防部长林彪表扬作战有功部队的嘉奖令。曹里怀、龙道权在热烈的掌声中，分别把奖状、奖品授给立功单位代表和有功人员。
    曹里怀在大会上讲话，向这次击落美帝国主义A—3B重型攻击机的作战有功部队和人员表示热烈祝贺。他说，在我国政府对美舰美机侵犯我国领海领空提出整整四百次严重警告之后，美帝国主义又悍然派遣它的重型攻击机侵入我国大陆上空，进行军事挑衅活动，这是对我国领空主权的公然侵犯，也是美帝国主义在加紧扩大侵略越南战争的同时，妄图把战争强加在中国人民的头上的一个严重步骤。你们一举把侵犯我国领空的敌机击落，这是对侵略成性的美帝国主义猖狂的战争挑衅的迎头痛击。
    曹里怀强烈谴责美帝国主义越来越疯狂地扩大侵略越南的战争，频繁地派遣军舰飞机侵犯中国领海领空，以及美国空中强盗不断在公海上跟踪袭击我国渔船、商船，打死打伤我国渔民。他严正警告美国侵略者：中国人民是不可侮的，中国领空是神圣不可侵犯的。对于美帝国主义的任何挑衅，我们都已做好了准备。如果美国强盗胆敢来犯，我们就坚决打。不管你是唆使奴才走狗来，还是亲自来，都逃脱不了被歼灭的命运。
    曹里怀说，我们空军部队肩负着保卫祖国领空的光荣任务，必须继续高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚决执行林彪同志关于突出政治的五项原则，认真总结这次战斗经验，戒骄戒躁，提高警惕，加强战备，随时准备打击敢于来犯的敌机，争取更大的胜利。
    中共广东省委书记处书记尹林平在讲话中热烈祝贺这次空战的胜利，并号召广东省各界人民认真学习参战的空军部队高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，坚持四个第一的经验，团结一致，遵照毛主席关于人民战争思想的教导，努力搞好社会主义革命和各项生产建设，把民兵工作作得好上加好，落实再落实，把东南沿海建设成铁的长城，誓作人民解放军的后盾。
    广州部队负责人晏福生在讲话中，要求东南前线陆、海、空三军广大指战员，把毛主席的书当作我们一切工作的最高指示，百倍提高警惕，加强战备，随时准备为彻底埋葬胆敢来犯的美国侵略者，作出我们的贡献。
    作战部队代表杨健全在讲话中衷心感谢党和国家给予他们的崇高荣誉和鼓励。他表示，一定要牢记毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，兢兢业业，决不自满，永远突出政治，永远突出毛泽东思想，深入扎实地作好政治思想工作，把林彪副主席提出的五项原则反复落实，真正落实到基层，真正落实到每一个环节，真正落实到每一个人身上，把各项战备工作作得更好，更加扎实，用新的胜利来回答党和人民的关怀。（附图片）
