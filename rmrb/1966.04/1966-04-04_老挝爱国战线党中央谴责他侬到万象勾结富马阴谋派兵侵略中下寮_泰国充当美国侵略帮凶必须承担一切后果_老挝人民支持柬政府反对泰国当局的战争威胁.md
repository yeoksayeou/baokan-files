    According to a report from Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, April 2nd: Radio Pathet Lao broadcasted on the 1st that the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a statement on March 29th, expressing full support for the March 20th statement of the Royal Government of Cambodia protesting the war threat issued by the Thai reactionaries.

    The statement from the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front said that recently, the Thai reactionary authorities fabricated a story that the Royal Cambodian Army "attacked" Thai villages, ordered the Thai Air Force to be stationed at airports near the Cambodian border in order to immediately use aircraft to attack the outposts of the Cambodian border guards when necessary, and at the same time authorized the Navy to attack the outposts of the Cambodian border guards.

    The statement pointed out that the Thai reactionary authorities fabricated this lie to cover up its excuse for expanding the war and provocations against Cambodia. This action further exposed its ugly face in following and realizing the US imperialist plan to expand the war in Indochina. The statement said that the Thai reactionary authorities have also slandered the Lao Patriotic Front's army for "invading" Thailand, but in fact, it was the Thai reactionary authorities who sent Thai troops to invade Laos, cooperated with the Lao puppet army, and attacked the liberated areas of the Lao Patriotic Front and the Patriotic Neutralist Forces, allowing the United States to use Thai territory as a base for the US naval, land, and air forces, and allowing US aircraft to take off from Thai bases to carry out armed aggression against the Lao liberated areas.

    The statement said that the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front strongly condemns the provocative conspiracy of US imperialism and the Thai reactionary authorities against Cambodia, and demands that all the above conspiracies and actions must be stopped immediately.

    The statement concluded that US imperialism and the Thai reactionary authorities must bear full responsibility for all the consequences caused by their conspiracies and actions.

    According to a report from Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai: Radio Pathet Lao broadcast that the spokesperson of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a statement on the 27th, strongly protesting the activities of Thai Prime Minister Thanom in Vientiane.

    The statement pointed out that Thanom Kittikachorn arrived in Vientiane on the 28th upon the "invitation" of Prince Souvanna Phouma. This was done under the orders of US imperialism to strengthen the military alliance between Thailand and the Vientiane puppet authorities in order to strengthen and expand the war.

    The statement pointed out that under the orders of US imperialism, the Thai reactionary government and the Vientiane puppet authorities, together with US imperialism, established the so-called US-Thai-Laos Command, temporarily commanded by Thai Brigadier General Thongdet. The Vientiane authorities will recruit people from northeastern Thailand as soldiers, and the Thai reactionary authorities will send Thai spy commandoes to infiltrate the Lao right-wing army. At present, the Thai reactionary government has declared a state of war and issued a general mobilization order, ordering many troops to stand by to occupy the central and lower Laos regions.

    The statement said that the Lao Patriotic Front resolutely demands that the Thai reactionary government must immediately stop undermining the 1962 Geneva Agreement on the Laotian question, immediately stop interfering in Laos' internal affairs, and must withdraw all military personnel, troops, weapons, war equipment, and spy commandoes sent and transported into Laos for combat. The Lao Patriotic Front demands that the Vientiane puppet authorities and Prince Souvanna Phouma must immediately stop military collusion with the Thai reactionary authorities, otherwise they must bear full responsibility for all the consequences caused by such actions.

    老挝人民支持柬政府反对泰国当局的战争威胁
    据新华社康开二日电　据巴特寮电台一日广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会三月二十九日发表声明，表示完全支持柬埔寨王国政府三月二十日关于抗议泰国反动当局发出战争威胁的声明。
    老挝爱国战线党中央的声明说，最近，泰国反动当局捏造柬埔寨王国军队“袭击”泰国村庄，命令泰国空军进驻柬埔寨边境附近的机场，以便在必要的时候，立即用飞机袭击柬埔寨边防军的哨所，同时授权海军袭击柬埔寨边防军的哨所。
    声明指出，泰国反动当局捏造这一谎言，是为了用来掩盖它扩大对柬埔寨的战争和挑衅的借口，这个作法更加暴露出它追随和实现美帝国主义扩大印度支那战争计划的丑恶嘴脸。声明说，泰国反动当局也曾经污蔑老挝爱国战线党方面的军队“侵入”泰国，但事实上，是泰国反动当局派遣泰国军队侵入老挝，同老挝傀儡军队配合，进攻老挝爱国战线党和爱国中立力量的解放区，让美国利用泰国领土作为美国的海、陆、空军基地，让美国的飞机从泰国基地起飞，对老挝解放区进行武装侵略。
    声明说，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会强烈谴责美帝国主义和泰国反动当局对柬埔寨的挑衅阴谋，并要求必须立即停止上述一切阴谋和行动。
    声明最后说，美帝国主义和泰国反动当局必须对由它们的阴谋和行动而造成的一切后果承担全部责任。
    据新华社康开电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会发言人二十七日发表声明，强烈抗议泰国总理他侬到万象活动。
    声明指出，他侬·吉滴卡宗应梭发那·富马亲王的“邀请”，二十八日到万象。这是根据美帝国主义的命令，增强泰国同万象傀儡当局的军事联盟，以便加强和扩大战争。
    声明指出，在美帝国主义的命令下，泰国反动政府，万象傀儡当局同美帝国主义一起成立了所谓美国、泰国、老挝指挥部，由泰国准将通铁暂时当总指挥。万象当局将招募泰国东北部的人当兵，泰国反动当局将派遣泰国间谍别动队渗入老挝右派军队里。目前，泰国反动政府已宣布处于战争状态并发布了总动员令，命令许多军队待机进占老挝中寮和下寮地区。
    声明说，老挝爱国战线党坚决要求泰国反动政府必须立即停止破坏一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，立即停止干涉老挝的内部事务，必须把它派遣和运进老挝参战的军事人员、军队、武器、战争装备和间谍别动队全部撤出老挝。老挝爱国战线党要求万象傀儡当局和梭发那·富马亲王必须立即停止同泰国反动当局进行军事勾结，否则，它们必须对这种行动所造成的一切后果担负全部责任。
