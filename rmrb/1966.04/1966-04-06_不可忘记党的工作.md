    Never Forget Party Work
    Meng Shaowen, Party Branch Secretary of the Third Workshop, Beijing Micro-motor Factory

    I arrived at the Third Workshop in 1964 and became the Party Branch Secretary. At the time, I knew that the branch secretary had to manage Party work and political work. However, I thought that production was a hard task that couldn't be ignored. Therefore, I worked day and night to grasp production, and also managed administrative affairs. The busier I got, the less I could do Party work.
    Our workshop director, Guo Dexin, is not a Party member. Seeing that I was managing administrative matters related to production, he rarely bothered with them. If he didn't manage them, I thought, I also understand technology and can manage. So, I managed even more. As a result, ideological problems piled up, and more workers came to me. Some comrades who came to me always couldn't get their turn. Everyone got anxious and said, "To talk to the branch secretary, you have to wait in line for a week." I thought, "There are many female comrades in the workshop, with many opinions, there is just no way." I came at six in the morning and went back at ten in the evening, which even made my wife complain about me. Despite being so busy, production was still not good, and the task was not completed every month. I thought, I simply can't do this job as branch secretary, I might as well specialize in production. At this time, the responsible comrade of the Party general branch said to me, "You have to grasp Party work and ideological and political work. Not doing so is dereliction of duty." The comrades of the branch committee also criticized me, saying that I only cared about production, took on all administrative matters, and didn't grasp the most important things. Later, we learned from the advanced branch's work experience, and our understanding gradually improved. I felt that I had not done a good job as branch secretary, but only acted as the first director of the workshop, making a big mistake. What should I do? I went to Chairman Mao Zedong's works to find the answer. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "The secretary should be a good squad leader." "If this 'squad' is not in step, it is hopeless to lead millions upon millions of people in battle and construction." I thought, I should be a good squad leader, and not do everything myself. I want to mobilize the branch committee and all Party members. In order to do Party work well, I cannot take on all administrative matters. I should manage what I should manage in production, and resolutely not manage what I shouldn't manage. I cannot replace the work of the workshop director.
    In order to do the work well, I went to workshop director Guo Dexin to discuss it together. I said to him, "In the past, I grasped production too much, and I didn't discuss some things with you, I just decided on them myself. I will correct these shortcomings." He said, "I saw that you were managing many things, so I didn't bother with them. The more you manage, the less I want to manage. I thought, anyway, I'm just filling a quota. This way, I'm not proactive in my work." The two of us spoke our minds, each talked about their shortcomings, and resolved to take joint responsibility to do the work well. After that, we discussed things together when we had work. I went to his house several times, talking about ideology, talking about problems, and the relationship became more and more harmonious. He became more proactive in his work, not only grasping production, but also grasping ideological work.
    When I got rid of administrative affairs, I had time to grasp Party work. Our branch committee made specific divisions of labor and went deep into key groups to solve problems. In addition, we often organized the study of the Party Constitution and Chairman Mao's works to improve the ideological awareness of Party members. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "We Communists are like seeds, and the people are like the soil. When we arrive in a place, we must unite with the people there, take root and blossom among the people." We use Comrade Mao Zedong's thinking to educate Party members, asking everyone not only to manage their own production well, but also to do Party work, to help others, and to take root and blossom among the people. All thirteen Party members in our branch were mobilized, and everyone did ideological and political work. There are a total of one hundred and twenty people in the workshop. Party members have used Sundays to visit the homes of more than seventy people. I am not as busy and chaotic as before. When a comrade wants to find me, Party member Liu Xiuhua says, "Let's talk first!" Party members have done a lot of ideological and political work. Not only Party members are doing it, but the working masses are also doing it. Hu Haiyan took the initiative to visit an old worker's home. She said, "The leadership asked me to come and see you, and to help you solve any difficulties." The old worker was very grateful. Now, the workers are even more advanced, and the backward are turning advanced. The workshop is full of "red pairs" and "strings of red" deeds, and everyone is very motivated.
    I grasped Party work, and mobilized all Party members and various organizations to do ideological and political work, and the production situation greatly improved. In 1966, the production situation was also very good. From my own personal experience, I deeply feel the sweetness of doing Party work. Now, I am determined to study Chairman Mao's works hard, highlight politics, and conscientiously grasp the Party's ideological construction. I believe that as long as we do this seriously, production will definitely be better.

    不可忘记党的工作
    北京微电机厂三车间党支部书记　孟绍温
    我在一九六四年到了三车间，做党支部书记。当时，我也知道，支部书记要管党的工作，要管政治工作。可是，我又想，生产是硬任务，不管不行。于是，我就日日夜夜抓生产，行政事务也管起来。越忙，党的工作越是没法做。
    我们车间主任郭德馨，不是党员。他看到我管起生产上的行政事务，他就很少管了。他不管，我想，我也懂技术，也能管。于是，就管得更多。这样一来，思想问题压得更多，工人来找我的也就更多了。有的同志找我，总是挨不上号。大家急了说，“找支部书记谈话，也得排一个星期。”我就认为，“车间女同志多，意见多，真没办法。”早上六点钟来，晚上十点回去，闹得爱人对我也有意见。就是这样忙法，生产还是搞不好，月月完不成任务。我一想，干脆，我干不了这个支部书记，专门搞生产得了。这个时候，党总支负责同志对我说，“你要抓党的工作，抓思想政治工作。不这样做，就是失职。”支委会的同志也对我提意见，说我只管生产，包揽行政事务，没有把最重要的事情抓起来。以后，我们学习了先进支部的工作经验，认识逐步提高了。我觉得自己没有做好支部书记，只做了车间第一主任，犯了一个大错。怎么办呢？我到毛泽东同志的著作中去找答案，毛泽东同志说，“书记要当好班长”。“如果这‘一班人’动作不整齐，就休想带领千百万人去作战，去建设。”我想，我应该当好班长，不能一个人去干。我要把支委会都发动起来，把全体党员都发动起来。为了做好党的工作，我不能包揽行政事务。在生产中，该管的管，不该管的坚决不管。我不能代替车间主任的工作。
    为了做好工作，我找车间主任郭德馨，共同商量。我对他说，“过去，我对生产抓得多，有些事情也没同你商量，自己就决定了。这些缺点，我要好好改。”他说，“我看到许多事情你管了，我就不管了。你越是管得多，我越是不想管，我想，反正我是充个数。这样，我在工作上也就不主动了。”我们两个人把心里话都说了，各人都谈了自己的缺点，决心共同负责，把工作搞好。以后，有了工作，我们在一起商量。我到他家去了好几趟，谈思想，谈问题，关系越来越融洽了。他工作主动了，不但抓生产，而且也抓思想工作。
    我摆脱了行政事务，就有时间抓党的工作。我们支委具体分工，深入到重点组解决问题。此外，我们经常组织学习党章，学习毛主席著作，提高党员的思想觉悟。毛泽东同志说，“我们共产党人好比种子，人民好比土地。我们到了一个地方，就要同那里的人民结合起来，在人民中间生根、开花。”我们就用毛泽东同志的这个思想来教育党员，要求大家不要光管自己生产好，还要去做党的工作，去帮助别人，在人民中生根、开花。我们支部十三个党员，个个都发动起来，人人做思想政治工作。全车间共一百二十人。党员利用星期天，已访问了七十多人的家庭。我也不象从前那样忙乱了。一个同志要找我，党员刘秀华说，“我们先谈谈吧！”有许多思想政治工作，党员都做了。不仅党员做，工人群众都来做。胡海燕主动到一个老工人家去访问。她说，“领导上要我来看看你，有什么困难，帮助你解决。”老工人很感激。现在，工人们是先进更先进，后进变先进。车间里“一对红”、“一串红”的事迹纷纷出现，个个干劲很高。
    我抓了党的工作，发动全体党员、各种组织来做思想政治工作，生产情况大大好转了。一九六六年，生产情况也很好。从我自己的切身体会，深深感到做党的工作的甜头。现在，我决心努力学好毛主席著作，突出政治，认真抓好党的思想建设。我相信，只要认真这样做，生产一定会更好。
