    Indonesian Right-Wing Regime Exposes Its Own Two-Faced Tactics of Feigned Anti-Imperialism and Real Capitulation
    Malik Admits Indonesia Is Relying on the U.S. and Colluding with Japan
    Johnson Administration Immediately Expresses Praise and Resumes "Aid," Providing Rice
    Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd Dispatch from Jakarta: Since coming to power, the Indonesian right-wing military regime has intensified its efforts to rely on U.S. imperialism, exposing its two-faced tactics of playing at anti-imperialism while genuinely capitulating.
    According to Antara News Agency reports, Indonesian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Adam Malik has repeatedly made a pretense of saying that the Indonesian revolution is still “leftist,” that “the goals of our revolution have not changed,” and that Indonesia will not relax its efforts to “unite all forces in the world that oppose imperialism and old and new colonialism.” However, an earlier Associated Press dispatch pointed out that these words of the Indonesian right-wing military regime against imperialism are “mainly for domestic consumption,” and that “they cannot suddenly make a 180-degree turn; these people are acting cunningly and cautiously.”
    Facts show that while frantically opposing China and persecuting Chinese people to please imperialism and its accomplices, the right-wing military regime is stepping up its collusion with U.S. imperialism. In a speech on April 4th, Malik openly declared that Indonesia’s future foreign policy would be centered on relying on the United States. He said that Indonesia will “seek to improve relations with the United States” and that “we will do our utmost to quickly stabilize this relationship.” He also said obsequiously, “In the past, (Indonesia’s) relationship with the United States was good. We had some difficulties in implementing this relationship, and we will overcome the difficulties that exist now.” The U.S. authorities greatly appreciated Malik’s expression of “friendliness.” U.S. State Department Press Officer Wright, on behalf of Johnson, said that day, “We note the remarks made by the Foreign Minister that the Indonesian government intends to do its best to improve and harmonize relations with the United States. We, like the Indonesian government, hope to do this.”
    After Malik announced this pro-American foreign policy, he then held several meetings with the U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia, Green, and conducted “friendly talks” on relations between the two countries. At the same time, the right-wing military clique also released the American “missionaries” who were arrested before the September 30th Incident, re-invited the expelled American journalists to return to Indonesia, and announced that it would send a delegation led by Deputy Prime Minister Buwono to “visit” the United States, the Soviet Union, and Japan. To vigorously support the Indonesian right-wing military regime, the United States recently resumed the “U.S. aid” it had suspended since the beginning of 1965, announcing that it would provide it with 50,000 tons of rice to help solve its “urgent needs.”
    In the process of “seeking to improve relations with the United States,” the Indonesian right-wing military regime is also stepping up its collusion with the Japanese Sato government and hopes that Japan will act as a “broker” in order to obtain “aid” from the United States and other Western countries. According to reports, Malik recently made a speech to Japanese reporters, saying that “the Indonesian government will do its best to restore economic and trade relations with Japan.” In his speech, Malik “frankly admitted that the deterioration of trade relations between Japan and Indonesia… the fault lies with Indonesia for not repaying its debts to Japan.” He hoped to “clear this obstacle in the near future.” Malik also stated that Indonesia is prepared to send an economic delegation headed by Deputy Prime Minister Buwono to visit Japan at the end of April to discuss strengthening “cooperative relations between the two countries” and new economic assistance programs. On the other hand, in addition to deciding to grant Indonesia US$2.5 million in “emergency economic assistance,” the Japanese government is also planning to establish a “Tokyo Club” to assist Indonesia, including the United States. Japanese Prime Minister Sato also instructed Japanese Ambassador to Indonesia Saito on the 18th to notify the Indonesian government that the Japanese government plans to provide Indonesia with “emergency and long-term economic assistance.”
    Two other important steps taken by the Indonesian right-wing military regime in implementing its foreign policy of relying on imperialism are: announcing that Indonesia will return to the United Nations under U.S. control and stop its confrontation with “Malaysia.” Malik openly announced on April 4th that the Indonesian “government will consider joining various international organizations, including the United Nations.” Right-wing general clique leader Suharto recently stated that Indonesia “welcomes a peaceful resolution to the (Malaysia) dispute.” Malik then also said that “once talks begin, military confrontation will ease.”

    印尼右派政权假反帝真投靠两面手法自行揭穿
    马利克供认印尼投靠美国勾结日本
    约翰逊政府立即加以赞赏并恢复“援助”提供大米
    新华社二十二日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派军人政权上台后加紧投靠美帝国主义的大量事实，揭穿了它玩弄的假反帝、真投靠的两面手法。
    据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚内阁副总理兼外交部长阿达姆·马利克曾一再装模作样地表白说，印度尼西亚革命仍然是
  “左的”，“我们的革命目标没有改变”，印度尼西亚将不放松致力于“把世界上全部反对帝国主义和反对新老殖民主义力量联合起来的事业”。但是，美联社早些时候的一条消息就指出，印度尼西亚右派军人政权的这些反对帝国主义的词句，
  “主要是说给国内的人们听的”，“他们不能够突然来个一百八十度的改变，这些人的行动是狡猾和谨慎的”。
    事实表明，右派军人政权在疯狂地反华、排华以讨好帝国主义及其帮凶的同时，正在同美帝国主义加紧勾搭。马利克在四月四日发表的谈话中，公开宣布印度尼西亚今后的外交政策将以投靠美国为核心。他说，印度尼西亚将“设法改善同美国的关系”，“我们将尽我们最大的力量使这种关系很快平稳起来”。他还奴颜婢膝地说，“过去（印度尼西亚）同美国的关系是好的。在执行这个关系方面，我们有了一些困难，我们将克服现在存在的困难”。美国当局对马利克的这种“友好”表示极为赞赏。美国国务院新闻发布官赖特当天就代表约翰逊发表讲话说，“我们注意到这位外交部长所说的印度尼西亚政府打算尽最大努力使同美国的关系得到改善和融洽的谈话。我们和印度尼西亚政府一样希望做到这一点。”
    在马利克公布这个亲美外交路线以后，他接着就同美国驻印度尼西亚大使格林举行了几次会晤，就两国之间的关系进行了“友好的会谈”。与此同时，右派军人集团还释放了在九月三十日事件以前被捕的美国“传教士”，重新邀请被驱逐出境的美国记者返回印度尼西亚，并且宣布要派遣一个由副总理布沃诺率领的代表团“访问”美国、苏联和日本。为了大力支持印度尼西亚右派军人政权，美国最近恢复了它自一九六五年初中断的“美援”，宣布向它提供五万吨大米，以帮助解决它的“紧急需要”。
    印度尼西亚右派军人政权在“设法改善同美国的关系”的过程中，也在加紧同日本佐藤政府的勾结，并且希望日本充当“掮客”，以便得到美国和其它西方国家的“援助”。据报道，马利克最近曾对日本记者发表讲话，表示“印度尼西亚政府将尽力恢复同日本的经济和贸易关系”。马利克在讲话中“坦率地承认，日本和印度尼西亚之间贸易关系恶化……过错是在不偿还日本债务的印度尼西亚方面”。他希望“在最近的将来能够清除这个障碍。”马利克还表示，印度尼西亚准备派以副总理布沃诺为首的经济代表团在四月底访问日本，讨论加强“两国的合作关系”和新的经济援助计划。另一方面，日本政府除了决定给予印度尼西亚二百五十万美元的“紧急经济援助”之外，并策划成立包括美国在内的援助印度尼西亚的“东京俱乐部”。日本首相佐藤十八日还指示日本驻印度尼西亚大使斋藤通知印度尼西亚政府，日本政府计划向印度尼西亚提供“紧急和长期经济援助”。
    印度尼西亚右派军人政权在执行投靠帝国主义的外交政策中采取的另两个重要步骤是：宣布印度尼西亚将要回到美国控制下的联合国和停止对“马来西亚”的对抗。马利克在四月四日公开宣布印度尼西亚“政府将考虑加入各种国际机构，包括联合国”。右派将领集团头目苏哈托不久前表示，印度尼西亚“欢迎和平解决（马来西亚）争端”。马利克随后也说，“一旦会谈开始，军事对抗就将缓和”。
