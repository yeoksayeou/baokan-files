    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th -- The Japanese Communist Party's central organ newspaper, *Red Flag*, pointed out that the "Southeast Asia Development Ministerial Conference" currently being held in Tokyo is a major conspiracy by the Japanese Sato government to help the United States implement a system of aggression and national oppression in Southeast Asia, create conditions for Japan's economic expansion into the region, and strengthen the "containment of China" politically and economically.

    *Red Flag* said that the Japanese Sato government is attempting to serve the United States, which is promoting the war of aggression against Vietnam and has been strongly condemned internationally, through the "Southeast Asia Development Ministerial Conference." Last July, at the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee on Trade and Economic Affairs, Rusk stated: "We expect Japan to play a major role in prompting Asian countries to respond to Johnson's proposal for the development of Southeast Asia." The "Southeast Asia Development Ministerial Conference" hosted by the Sato government is faithfully fulfilling U.S. President Johnson's demand for $10 billion to "develop Southeast Asia."

    *Red Flag* said that although the Japanese Sato government is desperately promoting this conference as a purely "economic problem" discussion, this conference and the "Foreign Ministers' Conference" of Asian anti-communist countries and puppet groups, planned by the South Korean Park Chung-hee puppet clique for June, are both to act as pawns for the United States in expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam.

    *Red Flag* said that Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato, at the opening of the conference, stated that "the sense of solidarity among Asians has risen," that "[Japan] will significantly increase assistance to Southeast Asia's development in the near future," that "this conference will not only discuss technical economic development issues," and that he hopes it will "become an important step in creating an Asian vision," etc. *Red Flag* said that the Japanese Sato government, which has been desperately clamoring recently for "fulfilling the obligations of the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty' and sending the 'Self-Defense Forces' abroad," "cannot hide the armor beneath its clothes even if it puts on a lot of pleasant words such as 'Asian solidarity' and promoting 'independent diplomacy'."

    *Red Flag* said, "Japanese monopoly capital needs to seize the agriculture of Southeast Asian countries first in order to carry out economic aggression." Japanese Economic Planning Agency Director-General Aiichiro Fujiyama said at the meeting, "For Asia, developing agriculture and expanding food production is an urgent task," and "An important aspect of the economic and technical cooperation that our country [Japan] provides in the future is to provide assistance to agricultural development in Asia." *Red Flag* pointed out that this signifies the plundering of more agricultural products from the region as the price of (Japanese) monopoly capital's expansion into Southeast Asia.

    《赤旗报》揭露日本召开“东南亚开发部长会议”为美帝“遏制中国”效劳
    佐藤政府在“亚洲团结”外衣下贩卖扩张侵略的黑货
    新华社东京七日电　日共中央机关报《赤旗报》指出，目前正在东京举行的“东南亚开发部长会议”，是日本佐藤政府企图在东南亚帮助美国推行侵略和民族压迫的体制，以及为日本向这个地区进行经济扩张创造条件，并从政治上和经济上加强“遏制中国”的一个大阴谋。
    《赤旗报》说，日本佐藤政府企图通过“东南亚开发部长会议”替推行侵越战争并在国际上受到强烈谴责的美国效劳。去年七月，在日美贸易经济联合委员会上，腊斯克曾经说过：“期待日本在促使亚洲各国对约翰逊关于开发东南亚作出反应方面起主要作用”。佐藤政府主持的“东南亚开发部长会议”，正是忠实地履行了美国总统约翰逊提出的用十亿美元“开发东南亚”的要求。
    《赤旗报》说，尽管日本佐藤政府拼命地宣传这次会议是一次纯粹地讨论“经济问题”的会议，但是，这次会议和南朝鲜朴正熙傀儡集团策划的于六月举行的亚洲反共国家和傀儡集团的“外长会议”，都是要为美国扩大侵越战争充当走卒的。
    《赤旗报》说，日本首相佐藤荣作在会议开幕时说什么“亚洲人的团结意识高涨了”，“（日本）要在最近大幅度地援助东南亚的开发”，“这个会议不仅讨论技术性的经济开发问题”，希望它能“成为创造亚洲远景的重要的一步”等等。《赤旗报》说，最近一个时期拼命叫嚷要“履行日美‘安全条约’的义务、派‘自卫队’出国”的日本佐藤政府，“即使摆一大堆什么‘亚洲人的团结’呀，促进‘自主外交’呀等等动听的词句，也藏不住衣服下面露出的盔甲”。
    《赤旗报》说，“日本垄断资本要进行经济侵略，首先就需要抓住东南亚各国的农业。”日本经济企划厅长官藤山爱一郎在会上说，“对于亚洲来说，发展农业和扩大粮食生产是一个迫切的任务”，“今后我国（日本）提供的经济技术合作的一个重要的方面，就是对亚洲的农业开发提供协助”。《赤旗报》指出，这标志着作为（日本）垄断资本向东南亚进行扩张的代价，从这个地区掠夺更多的农产品。
