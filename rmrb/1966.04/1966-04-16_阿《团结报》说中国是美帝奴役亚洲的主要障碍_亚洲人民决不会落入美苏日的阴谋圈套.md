    The Albanian "Unity" Newspaper Says China is the Main Obstacle to American Imperialism's Enslavement of Asia
    Asian People Will Never Fall into the Conspiracy of the US, Soviet Union and Japan
    Xinhua, Tirana, 12th - The Albanian newspaper "Unity" published a commentary on the recent "Southeast Asia Development Ministerial Conference" held in Tokyo, condemning the Japanese militarists for actively serving the aggressive policies of American imperialism.
    The commentary pointed out that, at the instigation of American imperialists, the Japanese government has recently been actively engaged in activities aimed at becoming the gendarme for American imperialism to oppress and exploit the people of Asian countries. The "Southeast Asia Development Ministerial Conference" recently held in Tokyo serves the policy of the United States to expand the Vietnam War, encircle and isolate China, and suppress the Southeast Asian liberation movement.
    The commentary said that China is the main obstacle to American imperialism in promoting its plan to enslave the people of Asian countries and oppose world peace. In order to achieve the goal of "encircling China," the Japanese government is intensifying its collusion with Khrushchev revisionists, accelerating military armament, and playing a very important role in the conspiracy planned in Washington.
    The commentary pointed out that the Khrushchev revisionists have recently been very active, participating in conferences organized by American imperialists, and shamelessly associating with representatives of some Asian puppets. This betrayal has been angrily condemned by the people of the world and the Albanian people. Although the Khrushchev revisionists did not send representatives to the "Southeast Asia Development Ministerial Conference," they have long supported the issues discussed and decided at the conference.
    The commentary concluded that no matter what conspiracies imperialism and Khrushchev revisionists engage in, they will never achieve their sinister goals. The active participation of Japanese militarists in serving the aggressive plans of American imperialism will not bring any benefits to the United States. The people of Asian countries are vigilant and will never fall into this conspiracy.

    阿《团结报》说中国是美帝奴役亚洲的主要障碍
    亚洲人民决不会落入美苏日的阴谋圈套
    新华社地拉那十二日电  阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》十二日就最近在东京召开的“东南亚开发部长会议”发表评论，谴责日本军国主义者积极为美帝国主义的侵略政策效劳。
    评论指出，日本政府在美帝国主义者的唆使下，最近积极展开活动，企图变成美帝国主义压迫和剥削亚洲各国人民的宪兵。最近在东京召开的“东南亚开发部长会议”，是为美国扩大越南战争、包围和孤立中国、镇压东南亚解放运动的政策服务的。
    评论说，中国是美帝国主义推行它的奴役亚洲各国人民和反对世界和平计划的主要障碍。为了达到“包围中国”的目的，日本政府同赫鲁晓夫修正主义者加紧勾结，加速军事武装，在华盛顿策划的阴谋中起着十分重要的作用。
    评论指出，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者最近活动频繁，参加美帝国主义者组织的会议，不知羞耻地与亚洲的一些傀儡的代表为伍，这种背叛行为受到了全世界人民以及阿尔巴尼亚人民的愤怒谴责。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者虽然没有派代表参加这次“东南亚开发部长会议”，但是他们早就支持这次会议所讨论和决定的问题。
    评论最后说，不管帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者搞什么阴谋，他们永远也达不到他们的罪恶目的。日本军国主义者为美帝国主义侵略计划效劳而积极活动，不会给美国带来任何好处。亚洲各国人民是有警惕性的，他们永远也不会落入这个阴谋圈套。
