    Brief Discussion on "Doing Things Personally"	Yang Pu
    "You can't let the cripple direct the hunt – shouting while sitting!" This is a saying often used by Comrade Du Fengming, Director of the Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative. Indeed, as a leading cadre, to do a good job, it's not enough to just "shout while sitting;" you also have to personally get involved and do things yourself.
    Does that mean you have to personally do everything? No, it doesn't. Comrade Du Fengming put it well: doing everything "personally and meticulously," first of all, is "impossible," and second, is "unnecessary." The *Zizhi Tongjian* has a passage that says Zhuge Liang "often proofread documents himself," to the point that he was "sweating all day long, was he not tired?" It seems that this Mr. Zhuge did not quite understand this principle; he had to personally check all documents and reports, regardless.
    In our revolutionary ranks, cadres who hold certain leadership positions who do everything "personally and meticulously" or do nothing "personally" are probably very rare. The problem is that some comrades, although they are also "sweating all day long, are they not tired?", do not "personally" attend to the "things" that must be done "personally," but instead "personally" attend to "things" that do not necessarily need to be done "personally."
    As a revolutionary leading cadre, what "things" must be done "personally"? Emphasizing politics, understanding the situation, and mastering policies – these big "things" must be done "personally." The exemplary deeds of Comrade Du Fengming tell us that comrades engaged in leadership work, if they want to emphasize politics well, understand the situation deeply, and grasp policies accurately, must personally go deep among the masses and into reality.
    Going deep into reality and deep among the masses is a big "thing" that cannot be replaced by others; for our leading cadres, it is something they must "personally" do themselves. Why? Through this "personal involvement," true knowledge can be obtained. In the past, when Comrade Du Fengming went down to guide work, he mostly just wandered around, looked, listened, and talked. Therefore, many things he said were not to the point. In the past year or so, because he personally carried a basket up the mountain and personally went to the village to purchase goods, he did not "shallowly enter" the masses but rather "deeply entered" the masses, he did not just wander around, look, and listen, but rather personally practiced. In this way, he obtained true knowledge, and many of the ideas he came up with were to the point. Through this "personal involvement," another "closeness" can be exchanged – a close relationship with the masses. If you rarely go deep among the masses, you will naturally be estranged from the masses; frequent deep involvement with the masses will enable you to strengthen your ties with the masses. Through this "personal involvement," you can also transform your own ideology and work style. Frequent deep involvement in reality and close ties with the masses can enhance your own class feelings and mass viewpoint and can prevent and overcome subjectivism and bureaucratic work styles.
    When going into the masses, you must appear before the masses in the posture of an ordinary laborer, just like Comrade Du Fengming. When Comrade Du Fengming arrived at the grassroots level, he sold goods, purchased goods, loaded goods, unloaded goods, carried water, helped in the kitchen, wiped shelves, swept the yard, cleaned toilets – he did everything, placing himself in the position of an ordinary laborer. Of course, some of our leading cadres are older and physically weaker, and when engaging in specific work and participating in physical labor, they should be realistic and do what they can. However, in any case, the principle of appearing before the masses in the posture of an ordinary laborer is essential.
    To achieve such "personal involvement" is not easy. First, you must not be afraid of hardship and not seek comfort; second, you must put down your "burden" and discard your "airs." Comrade Du Fengming did just that, so he "personally involved" himself very well in the big "thing" of going deep among the masses and into reality.

### “躬亲”简议

    “躬亲”简议	杨　浦
    “不能瘸子打围——坐着喊！”这是北京市供销合作社主任杜逢明同志常说的一句话。确实，作为一个领导干部，要把工作做好，光“坐着喊”是不行的，还得亲自动手干。
    是不是什么事情都得亲自动手干呢？那也不是。杜逢明同志说得好：什么都“事必躬亲”，第一是“不可能”，第二也“没有必要”。《资治通鉴》上有一段记载：诸葛亮“尝自校薄书”，弄得“流汗终日，不亦劳乎”。看来，这位诸葛先生就不大懂得这个道理，不管什么文件报表都要亲自检点。
    在我们革命队伍里，担任一定领导工作的干部，什么都“事必躬亲”或者什么都“事不躬亲”的情况，恐怕是极少见的。问题是在于：有些同志虽然也是“流汗终日，不亦劳乎”，可是，必须“躬亲”的“事”没有去“躬亲”，不一定要“躬亲”的“事”反而去“躬亲”了。
    作为一个革命的领导干部，哪些“事”必须“躬亲”呢？突出政治，了解情况，掌握政策，这些大“事”是必须“躬亲”的。杜逢明同志的模范事迹告诉我们，从事领导工作的同志，要想把政治突出得好，情况了解得深，政策掌握得准，就得亲自深入群众，深入实际。
    深入实际，深入群众这件大“事”，是不能让人代替的；对我们领导干部来说，是必须自己去“躬亲”的。为什么？通过这个“躬亲”，可以取得真知。杜逢明同志过去下去指导工作，多是转转，看看，听听，说说。因此，好些事都说不到点子上。最近一年多来，由于他亲自背篓上山，亲自下村收购，不是“浅入”群众，而是“深入”群众，不是转转，看看，听听，而是亲自实践，这样，他就取得了真知，出的许多主意就都出在点子上了。通过这个“躬亲”，能够换得另一个“亲”——同群众的亲密关系。如果很少深入群众，和群众当然就疏远了；经常深入群众，就能够密切自己和群众的联系。通过这个“躬亲”，还能够改造自己的思想作风。经常深入实际，密切联系群众，就能够增强自己的阶级感情和群众观点，就能够防止和克服主观主义、官僚主义的作风。
    深入到群众中去的时候，就得象杜逢明同志那样，以一个普通劳动者的姿态出现在群众面前。杜逢明同志到了基层，卖货，收购，装货，卸货，挑水，帮厨，擦货架，扫院子，掏厕所，什么都干，他把自己摆在一个普通劳动者的地位。当然，我们有些领导干部，年岁较大，身体较弱，在从事具体工作和参加体力劳动的时候，应当实事求是，量力而行。但是，无论如何，以普通劳动者的姿态出现在群众面前这一条，却是千万不可缺少的。
    要做到这样的“躬亲”，并不容易。第一要不怕艰苦，不图安逸；第二要放下“包袱”，丢掉“架子”。杜逢明同志正是这样做的，所以他在深入群众，深入实际这件大“事”上就“躬亲”得非常的好。
