    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, April 14th (via Pathet Lao Radio): Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front and Deputy Prime Minister of the Lao Tripartite National Union Government, sent a letter congratulating the Lao people on the Lao New Year, calling on the Lao people to unite closely and strive for greater victories in the cause of resisting America and saving the nation.

    The Lao New Year, also known as Songkran, usually begins on April 13th of the Gregorian calendar.

    Prince Souphanouvong's letter pointed out that in the past year, the Lao patriotic armymen and civilians have overcome numerous difficulties brought about by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, grown stronger than ever, and achieved many major victories. The liberated areas have been further consolidated and developed, becoming revolutionary bases for the national struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. The face of the liberated areas is constantly being renewed, and the material and cultural lives of the people are gradually improving.

    The letter said that the unity of the whole nation, especially the cooperative relationship between the Lao Patriotic Front and the patriotic neutral forces, is becoming increasingly consolidated. The just struggle of the Lao people is gaining increasingly widespread sympathy and support from peace-loving people around the world. The Lao Patriotic Front's international prestige is rising.

    The letter said that at the same time, in areas controlled by the United States and its running dogs, they are constantly intensifying their suppression and persecution of the Lao people. However, the Lao people never bow their heads to the enemy. They unite to fight against the enemy's "mopping up" operations and sabotage of the liberated areas, against oppression and exploitation, and against going to concentration camps under the guise of "Unity Villages" and "Rehabilitation Zones" run by the United States and its running dogs. Within the puppet army and puppet regime, more and more people who are dissatisfied with U.S. imperialism and its running dogs are returning to the people's just path. The struggle for power and position within the U.S. lackey group is becoming increasingly serious, and their strength is weakening.

    The letter pointed out that we must not be complacent about the achievements we have made at any time. At present, U.S. imperialism is stepping up its plot to expand the war of aggression to the entire Indochina, repeatedly clamoring to send the U.S. Army to directly occupy central and lower Laos, attempting to escape from the quagmire of South Vietnam.

    The letter called on the Lao patriotic armymen and civilians to constantly heighten their vigilance and make the new year a year of more new victories.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, April 14th (via Pathet Lao Radio): The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a statement on the 12th, strongly condemning the Thai army's invasion of the Long Dan Gu Temple in Cambodia, expressing full support for the Cambodian people's just struggle to safeguard their territory and sovereignty, and expressing infinite joy at Cambodia's recovery of the Long Dan Gu Temple.

    The statement pointed out that this offensive and provocative action by the Thai army is a continuation of the Thai reactionaries' long-standing offensives and provocations against Cambodia. "This action was instigated by U.S. imperialism and carried out according to a pre-planned scheme to attack and provoke." The statement pointed out that Laos and Cambodia have a common enemy – U.S. imperialism and the Thai reactionary authorities. The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front once again demands that the Thai reactionary authorities must immediately stop provocations against Cambodia and stop allowing U.S. imperialism to use Thai territory as a base for aggression against the countries of Indochina. Otherwise, they must bear full responsibility for all the serious consequences arising therefrom.

    苏发努冯亲王新年贺信说老挝解放区已进一步巩固发展
    号召在抗美救国斗争中争取新的胜利
    老挝爱国战线党声明支持柬埔寨人民反对泰国侵略的斗争
    新华社康开十四日电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席、老挝三方面民族团结政府副首相苏发努冯亲王写信向老挝全国人民祝贺老挝新年，号召老挝全国人民紧密团结，在抗美救国事业中争取更大的胜利。
    老挝新年又称宋干节，一般从公历四月十三日开始。
    苏发努冯亲王的贺信指出，一年来，老挝爱国军民克服了美帝国主义和它的走狗带来的重重困难，空前地壮大起来，取得了很多重大的胜利。解放区得到了进一步的巩固和发展，成为全民抗美救国斗争的革命根据地。解放区的面貌不断更新，人民的物质和文化生活逐步得到改善。
    贺信说，全民的团结，特别是老挝爱国战线党和爱国中立力量之间的合作关系日益巩固。老挝人民的正义斗争日益得到世界爱好和平人民的广泛同情和支持。老挝爱国战线党在国际上的威信日益提高。
    贺信说，与此同时，在美国和它的走狗控制的地区，它们不断地加紧镇压和迫害老挝人民。但是，老挝人民从不肯俯首向敌人屈服。他们团结起来进行斗争，反对敌人对解放区的“扫荡”和破坏，反对压迫和剥削，反对到美国和它的走狗挂着“团结村”和“振兴区”等幌子的集中营里去。在伪军和伪政权中，不满美帝国主义和它的走狗而回到人民的正义道路上来的人越来越多。在美国走狗集团内部争夺权利、地位的斗争日益严重，它们的力量日益衰弱。
    贺信指出，我们任何时候都不能对取得的成绩产生自满。目前美帝国主义正在加紧推进把侵略战争扩大到整个印度支那的阴谋，一再叫嚷要派美国陆军直接占领中寮和下寮地区；妄图从越南南方的泥潭中逃脱出来。
    贺信号召老挝爱国军民要不断提高警惕，使新的一年成为取得更多新胜利的一年。
    新华社康开十四日电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会十二日发表声明，严厉谴责泰国军队对柬埔寨隆端古寺的侵略，表示完全支持柬埔寨人民维护领土和主权的正义斗争，并且对柬埔寨收复隆端古寺表示无限高兴。
    声明指出，泰国军队的这一进攻和挑衅行动，是泰国反动当局长久以来对柬埔寨的进攻和挑衅的继续。“这一行动是由美帝国主义指使，根据已经策划好的计划进行进攻和挑衅的。”声明指出，老挝和柬埔寨有着共同的敌人——美帝国主义及泰国反动当局。老挝爱国战线党中央委员会再次要求泰国反动当局必须立即停止对柬埔寨的挑衅，停止让美帝国主义用泰国领土作为侵略印度支那各国的基地。否则，它们必须对由此而引起的一切严重后果承担全部责任。
