    The National Materials Work Conference Concludes from Discussions on the Relationships Between People and Things, Service and Management, and the Whole and the Part:
    The Materials Department Must Give Prominence to Politics in All its Work
    The conference calls on cadres at all levels of the materials department to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, starting with their own ideological revolutionization to drive the revolutionization of the materials work force and the revolutionization of materials work, and to blaze a path for socialist materials management work with Chinese characteristics.
    (Xinhua News Agency, April 17) Should materials management workers, who are constantly dealing with objects, emphasize giving prominence to politics? How should they give prominence to politics? This question was the subject of a major discussion at the recent National Materials Work Conference held in Beijing. Through discussion, many cadres in the materials management department have more clearly recognized that only by giving prominence to politics and adhering to the use of Mao Zedong Thought as a guide to handle the relationship between people and things, the relationship between service and management, and the relationship between the whole and the part, can we fundamentally cure the "occupational diseases" of seeing only things and not people, grasping "management" without grasping service, and caring for the part without caring for the whole, and can we build a revolutionary materials work force and blaze a path for socialist materials management work with Chinese characteristics.
    Managing Things Requires Managing People First
    Materials management work deals with things every day, and how to handle the relationship between people and things is a prominent contradiction in materials management work. At the beginning of the discussion, everyone exposed many erroneous views. Some people believe that the materials department, of course, mainly manages things, and the ideological work of people is a "production auxiliary workshop." Many people used facts to refute this idea of putting business first.
    The experience and lessons of the Xian Storage and Transportation Company's Xianyang Warehouse in handling the relationship between people and things have been most educational for everyone. This warehouse was originally a warehouse with relatively strong business and technical forces. At that time, many of the management personnel were business experts transferred from other places. They made a lot of business reports and management systems, and spent a lot of effort on materials management, but they did not manage the materials well. Later, the leading cadres went deep into the warehouse and, together with the demobilized People's Liberation Army cadres, started with their own revolutionization and strived to use Mao Zedong Thought as a guide to build a proletarian revolutionary team in the warehouse. They grasped class struggle and severely attacked capitalist forces. At the same time, they organized employees to study Chairman Mao's works and improve their class consciousness. After such hard work, the mental outlook of the employees changed. Now, this warehouse has been rated as a Daqing-style enterprise with both ideological and business excellence.
    Cadres from the materials bureaus of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Heilongjiang, Beijing, Tianjin, and other places also talked about their experiences and lessons in handling the relationship between people and things at the meeting. Many people believe that managing people before managing things is not only to manage and activate materials, but more importantly, it is related to preventing revisionism and ensuring that enterprises do not change color.
    Through this discussion of the relationship between people and things, everyone concluded that the "occupational disease" of seeing only things and not people in materials work must be eliminated. Things are dead, and people are alive. Only by taking class struggle as the key link and building a proletarian revolutionary team can things be managed effectively. Continuing to commit the "occupational disease" of seeing only things and not people will lead to the rotting of things, the ruin of people, and a change in the direction of materials work.
    Management Must Serve First
    The materials department is the production logistics department for managing materials. How to handle the relationship between management and service is also a prominent contradiction in materials work. At the beginning of the discussion, many erroneous ideas were exposed. Some people felt that the materials management department is just for management, allocating state materials according to indicators, and completing the task. Providing door-to-door service and asking about usage is like poking a hornet's nest and asking for trouble. They said: "Carding" according to indicators is a "characteristic" of the socialist planned economy. The experiences and lessons of many units in the discussion also thoroughly criticized this idea of putting business first.
    The Tianjin Municipal Materials Bureau's experience and lessons in handling the relationship between management and service over the past few years have been extremely profound. In the past, this bureau simply emphasized "management," which was actually "carding" users. They did not investigate when making plans, but sat in the office and, based on the figures reported by enterprises, "cut them in half" proportionally, stubbornly sticking to indicators and forcibly apportioning them. Salesmen were immersed all day in haggling over whether to follow the plan or exceed it, and whether to give more or less. As a result, users had many complaints about them. Later, the leading cadres of this bureau conscientiously studied Chairman Mao's works, humbly learned from Daqing and the People's Liberation Army's experience in giving prominence to politics, and resolved to serve production well. Leading cadres went deep into the grassroots to stay at selected points and vigorously carried out activities to go deep into enterprises and provide door-to-door business services in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions to serve the people. As the leaders made revolution, the atmosphere of going deep into production, going deep into reality, and going deep into the masses became prevalent, and service teams that directly went to factories to serve users were established one after another. The service teams of various companies went to factories to investigate needs, exchange varieties, adjust surpluses and shortages, and solve urgent production needs. Many materials became sufficient or surplus because they were distributed more rationally and utilized more fully. The relationship between the materials department and enterprises became closer.
    Many materials management departments in Wuhan, Shenyang, Beijing, and other provinces and cities have also followed the tortuous path of the Tianjin Materials Bureau.
    Through the discussion of the relationship between management and service, everyone clearly realized that the materials management department is a management department, but also more of a service department. Therefore, the idea of wholeheartedly serving production must be elevated to a guiding principle. Starting from production and serving production is the fundamental policy of materials work. The "occupational disease" of only "managing" and not serving is not a minor problem that can be cured or not, but a matter of the political direction and stance of materials work, which must be completely eradicated.
    The Part Must Subordinate to the Whole
    The materials department is a comprehensive department, managing the supply of materials to "thousands of households" under the central and local governments. It faces the relationship between the whole and the part every day, which is also a prominent contradiction in materials management work. At the beginning of the discussion, people also exposed many erroneous views. Some people felt that the whole is composed of parts, and it is not wrong to strive for some materials for the part. If every family has rice in the pot, then no one in the country will starve. This issue was the most debated in the discussion, and many people used facts to criticize this idea of being divorced from politics.
    Cadres from the China Timber Company and the China Metal Materials Company introduced their experiences and lessons in handling the relationship between the whole and the part. In the past, the materials ordering meetings held by these two companies often became "goods grabbing meetings." Many materials that were originally surplus were ordered empty, and as a result, they had to be apportioned equally, with good and bad mixed together and "pepper sprinkled." In this way, the urgently needed materials of key enterprises that played a decisive role in the overall situation could not be supplied, but there were backlogs in the warehouses of general enterprises. The products of key enterprises had an impact on the whole country, and if the key enterprises could not be guaranteed, it would in turn affect the production of general enterprises. Last year, the leading cadres of the two companies studied Chairman Mao's relevant instructions and realized that politics must be given prominence at the ordering meetings and that Mao Zedong Thought must be used as a guide to solve problems. Last year's ordering meeting was turned into a meeting that gave prominence to politics. At the meeting, they first studied Chairman Mao's works, exchanged learning experiences, spoke extensively about the domestic and international revolutionary situation, and inspired everyone to have the whole country in mind and to look at the world, and to recognize the importance of safeguarding the overall situation. Then, all the information about the materials was given to the participants, and everyone acted as masters, allocating them from the standpoint of the overall situation. Once politics was given prominence, the meeting changed completely. Units such as the Yichun Forestry Administration took the initiative to undertake difficulties and requested to complete the material supply tasks for key projects that determined the overall situation; Jiangsu and other places took the initiative to release valuable materials originally in stock to support other units.
    In the discussion, the experiences and lessons provided by many units showed that the whole and the part are contradictory and unified. Only by giving prominence to politics, having the whole country in mind, and looking at the world can the contradictions be unified. Many people said that materials workers must be revolutionaries who stand tall and see far. When dealing with problems, they must consider them from a political perspective, from the perspective of the party's line, principles, and policies, and from the perspective of the interests of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.
    The Key to Revolution is Leadership
    What is the key to giving prominence to politics in materials work? The leading cadres participating in the meeting found that none of the units that gave prominence to politics relatively well, as introduced at the discussion meeting, did not start with the revolutionization of the leading cadres. They did not cure the disease of seeing only things and not people and grasping "management" without grasping service by relying on slogans, orders, but by relying on leading cadres taking the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way, by relying on leading cadres constantly grasping class struggle and the struggle between the two roads, and by relying on leading cadres relying on the masses, promoting democracy, working hard, and working as ordinary laborers. In the final analysis, it depends on the transformation of the world outlook of the leading cadres. Therefore, in the later stage of the discussion, the leading cadres asked for self-revolution, and the discussion meeting became a rectification meeting. Yuan Baohua, Minister of Materials Management, in summarizing this major discussion on giving prominence to politics, pointed out that giving prominence to politics is a major issue for all the people, and it is especially important for the materials department, which deals with things all day long. Giving prominence to politics in materials work has its own special contradictions, but the principles for resolving the contradictions are the same as in all departments, and can only rely on studying Chairman Mao's works and grasping class struggle. At present, the revolutionary situation is good, and the key lies in leadership. Yuan Baohua asked leading cadres at all levels of the materials department to start with their own ideological revolutionization, drive the revolutionization of the materials work force, drive the revolutionization of materials work, and establish great ambitions and blaze a path for socialist materials management work with Chinese characteristics.

### 全国物资工作会议从讨论人和物、服务和管理、全局和局部关系中得出结论  物资部门必须在全盘工作中突出政治

    全国物资工作会议从讨论人和物、服务和管理、全局和局部关系中得出结论
    物资部门必须在全盘工作中突出政治
    会议要求物资部门的各级干部活学活用毛主席著作，从自己思想革命化作起，带动物资工作队伍的革命化，带动物资工作的革命化，闯出一条中国式的社会主义的物资管理工作的道路。
    据新华社十七日讯　经常同物打交道的物资管理工作者要不要强调突出政治？怎样突出政治？最近在北京召开的全国物资工作会议上，就这个问题开展了大讨论。通过讨论，物资管理部门许多干部比较明确地认识了：物资部门只有突出政治，坚持以毛泽东思想为指针处理人同物的关系，服务同管理的关系，全局同局部的关系，才能从根本上治好见物不见人、抓“管理”不抓服务、顾局部不顾全局的“职业病”，才能建设起一支革命化的物资工作队伍，闯出一条中国式的社会主义的物资管理工作的道路。
    管物要先管人
    物资管理工作，天天同物打交道，人同物的关系怎么摆，这是物资管理工作的一个突出矛盾。讨论初期，大家揭发出不少错误看法。有人认为，物资部嘛，当然管物是主要的，人的思想工作是“生产辅助车间”。许多人用事实批驳了这种业务挂帅的思想。
    西安储运公司咸阳仓库处理人同物的关系的经验教训给大家教育最大。这个仓库原先是个业务技术力量比较强的仓库。当时的管理人员有很多是从外地调来的业务行家。他们搞了不少业务表报、管理制度，在物资管理上花的功夫不算少，却没有管好物资。后来，领导干部深入仓库，同转业的解放军干部一起，从自己的革命化入手，努力用毛泽东思想作指导，在仓库建设无产阶级的革命队伍。他们抓住阶级斗争不放，狠狠打击了资本主义势力。与此同时，他们组织职工大学毛主席著作，提高职工的阶级觉悟。经过这样一番艰苦的工作，职工的精神面貌变了。现在，这个仓库已经被评为思想业务双过硬的大庆式企业。
    湖北、湖南、江苏、黑龙江、北京、天津等地物资局的干部，在会上也都谈了他们处理人同物的关系的经验教训。许多人认为，管物先管人不仅仅为了管好、管活物资，更重要的是关系到防止出修正主义，保证企业不变色的大问题。
    通过这场人与物关系的讨论，大家得出结论：物资工作见物不见人的“职业病”非打掉不可。物是死的，人是活的。只有以阶级斗争为纲，建设一支无产阶级革命队伍，才能把物管活。继续犯见物不见人的“职业病”，物要烂，人要毁，物资工作方向要变。
    管理要先服务
    物资部门是管理物资的生产后勤部。管理和服务的关系怎么摆，也是物资工作的一个突出矛盾。讨论初期揭发了不少错误思想。有人觉得，物资管理部嘛，就是搞管理的，把国家物资按指标分配下去，就完成了任务。上门服务，过问使用，那是?马蜂窝，自找麻烦。他们说：按指标“卡”，是社会主义计划经济的“特点”。讨论中许多单位的经验教训也彻底批判了这种业务挂帅的思想。
    天津市物资管理局几年来处理管理和服务关系的经验教训极为深刻。这个局过去单纯强调“管理”，实际上是“卡”用户。做计划不调查，坐在办公室依企业报来的数字，按比例“拦腰砍”，死抱着指标硬摊派。业务员整天沉在按计划还是超计划，给多还是给少的讨价还价里。结果，用户对他们的意见很多。后来，这个局的领导干部认真学习毛主席著作，虚心学习大庆、解放军突出政治的经验，下决心要为生产服务好。领导干部深入基层蹲点，按毛主席为人民服务的指示大搞深入企业、上门业务活动。领导一革命，深入生产，深入实际，深入群众的风气盛起来，直接下工厂为用户服务的服务队纷纷成立起来。各公司的服务队纷纷到工厂调查需要，串换品种，调剂余缺，解决生产急需。许多物资因为分配较合理，利用较充分，由紧张变成够用或有余。物资部门和企业的关系密切起来。
    走过象天津物资局这条曲折道路的，还有武汉、沈阳、北京等不少省市的物资管理部门。
    通过管理与服务关系的讨论，大家都明确认识了：物资管理部是管理部门，更是服务部门。因此，全心全意为生产服务的思想必须上纲。从生产出发，为生产服务是物资工作的根本方针。只“管理”不服务的“职业病”不是个可治可不治的小毛病，而是关系物资工作政治方向的立场问题，非彻底根除不可。
    局部要服从全局
    物资部门是个综合部门，统管中央、地方“千家万户”的物资供应，天天碰到全局和局部的关系，这也是物资管理工作的一个突出矛盾。在讨论初期，人们也揭发了不少错误看法。有人觉得，全局是局部组成的，给局部争点物资也不为错，家家锅里有米，全国就没有挨饿的了。这个问题讨论中争论最多，许多人用事实批判了这种脱离政治的思想。
    中国木材公司和中国金属材料公司的干部，介绍了他们处理全局同局部关系的经验教训。这两个公司过去召开的物资订货会议，常常开成“抢货会”。许多物资本来是有余的，竟一订而空了，结果，只好平均摊派，好坏搭配、撒“胡椒面”。这样常常对全局起决定作用的重点企业急需的物资，供应不上，一般企业仓库里却有积压。重点企业的产品对全国有影响，重点保不住，反过来也影响一般企业的生产。去年两个公司的领导干部学习了毛主席的有关指示，认识到订货会上必须突出政治，用毛泽东思想作指导来解决问题，去年的订货会开成了突出政治的会。会上，先学习毛主席著作，交流学习经验，大讲国内外革命形势，启发大家胸怀全国，放眼世界，认识保全局的重要意义。然后，把物资的底全部交给到会人员，人人作主人，站在全局进行分配。一经突出政治，会议就变了样。伊春林业管理局等单位主动承担困难，要求完成决定全局的重点项目的供材任务；江苏等地主动把原来库存的贵重物资让出来支援别的单位。
    在讨论当中，许多单位提供的经验教训说明，全局和局部是矛盾的，也是统一的。只有突出政治，胸怀全国，放眼世界，才能使矛盾统一起来。许多人说，物资工作者要做站得高看得远的革命家，处理问题，必须从政治上考虑，从党的路线、方针、政策上考虑，从中国革命和世界革命的利益上考虑。
    革命关键在领导
    物资工作突出政治的关键是什么？参加会议的领导干部发现，讨论会上介绍的突出政治较好的单位，没有一个不是从领导干部的革命化作起的。他们治好见物不见人、抓“管理”不抓服务的病不是靠口号，靠命令，靠的是领导干部以身作则带领群众活学活用毛主席著作，靠的是领导干部不断抓阶级斗争和两条道路的斗争，靠的是领导干部依靠群众，发扬民主，艰苦朴素，作普通劳动者的工作作风。归根到底，靠的是领导干部世界观的改造。因此，讨论后期，领导干部纷纷要求自我革命，讨论会开成了整风会。物资管理部部长袁宝华在总结这次突出政治的大讨论时，根据大家这种要求革命的思想指出：突出政治是全民的大事，对整天和物打交道的物资部门尤其重要。物资工作突出政治有自己的特殊矛盾，但解决矛盾的原则和所有部门一样，只能靠学习毛主席著作，狠抓阶级斗争。目前，革命形势好，关键在领导。袁宝华要求物资部门的各级领导干部要从自己的思想革命化作起，带动物资工作队伍的革命化，带动物资工作的革命化，树雄心立大志，闯出一条中国式的社会主义物资管理工作的道路。
