    U.S. Imperialism Can Only Hurt Itself by Underestimating the Power of the People
    South Vietnamese People's Anti-American Demonstrations Sweep Through Cities Under Enemy Occupation
    The Roar of "Yankee Go Home" Scares Da Nang U.S. Military Personnel From Going Out on the Streets
    Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch: Saigon news: The large-scale demonstrations against the U.S.-puppet clique that erupted in cities such as Saigon, Da Nang, and Hue in South Vietnam have rapidly spread to other cities temporarily ruled by the U.S.-puppet clique in the past two days.
    According to Western news agencies, in the past two days, the tide of popular anger against the United States and the Nguyen Cao Ky puppet group in the South Vietnamese U.S.-puppet-controlled areas has rapidly spread from Saigon, Da Nang, and Hue to major cities such as Qui Nhon, Nha Trang, Da Lat, Can Tho, and the central highlands of Pleiku, Kontum, and Buon Ma Thuot. Large numbers of students and citizens in these cities held demonstrations and strikes. Schools in cities such as Pleiku, Kontum, and Buon Ma Thuot were closed due to student strikes. Demonstrating students at a school in Nha Trang also built barricades around the campus to defend themselves against suppression by the puppet authorities.
    In the three major cities of Saigon, Da Nang, and Hue, which are already paralyzed, the situation continues to be very tense. Western news agencies said that in the large-scale anti-American demonstrations held by the people in these three cities, "a stronger anti-American atmosphere has emerged," and "the anti-American color is becoming more and more intense," especially in Da Nang, where "anti-American sentiment has reached a new climax."
    In Da Nang, which has already fallen into a state of paralysis, following a demonstration of more than 2,000 people on March 31, holding signs such as "Vietnam is the Vietnam of the Vietnamese" and "We protest the American aggression," on April 2, tens of thousands of people took to the streets to hold a large-scale demonstration and rally.
    According to a report from Da Nang by UPI, the U.S. "consul" in Da Nang also admitted on the 1st that "the anti-government (puppet regime) demonstrations here have a 'Yankee Go Home' tune." U.S. military personnel and Americans in Da Nang have been ordered "not to go out on the streets." Hue has also seen successive mass demonstrations and rallies in the past two days.
    The people of Can Tho City also held a large-scale anti-American demonstration. A Reuters dispatch from Can Tho on the 1st said: "The anti-American color is becoming more and more intense in the demonstrations. Yesterday, a speaker in the demonstration said: 'The United States is oppressing us—down with the Americans.'"
    With the anti-American wave sweeping through cities ruled by the U.S.-puppet clique, the United States and the Nguyen Cao Ky group are very alarmed and uneasy. On March 31, the Nguyen Cao Ky group hurriedly dispatched Pham Xuan Chieu, Secretary-General of the puppet "National Leadership Committee," along with the police chief, to Da Nang to plan the suppression of mass demonstrations. After Pham Xuan Chieu arrived in Da Nang, he not only failed to quell the people's anger, but was detained by the demonstrators for three days. Nguyen Cao Ky also announced on the 1st that "all demonstrations and strikes are illegal," in an attempt to create an excuse to suppress the people's resistance. But even U.S. news agencies are worried about whether the Nguyen Cao Ky puppet regime, which the United States has struggled to maintain, can survive.
    UPI admitted that Nguyen Cao Ky has fallen into a dead end: either "he has to use force to stop the demonstrations and enrage the people, so that they will launch riots in the streets," or "let the demonstrations continue, and the Americans will force him to step down because of the rising anti-American wave."
    Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch: Washington news: The recent series of mass demonstrations against the United States and its running dogs in major cities in South Vietnam has given the Johnson administration a big headache.
    Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs McCloskey said in a statement at his daily routine press briefing on the 1st: "Generally speaking, the recent situation in South Vietnam is a matter of some concern to the United States. Our embassy has been keeping us informed of these developments."
    The New York Times published an article on the 1st entitled "Unrest in Saigon and Washington," admitting that the United States is having an increasingly difficult time in South Vietnam.
    The article said that the United States is both worried about Nguyen Cao Ky being overthrown and afraid that "if the United States supports the Nguyen Cao Ky government too much, this may aggravate the anti-American sentiment that has already been manifested in some demonstrations."
    The article revealed that the United States is quietly interfering to help Nguyen Cao Ky "get through the difficulties." (Attached picture)
    On March 31, 3,000 people in Saigon held a large-scale anti-American demonstration. The picture shows the mighty demonstration team marching on the streets of Saigon, holding signs such as "Take back our sovereignty," "Vietnam is the Vietnam of the Vietnamese," and "We demand independence."

    美帝国主义低估人民力量就只能搬起石头砸自己的脚
    南越人民反美示威席卷敌占区各城市
    “美国佬滚回去”的怒吼声吓得岘港美军人员不敢上街
    新华社二日讯　西贡消息：南越西贡、岘港、顺化等城市爆发的大规模反对美伪集团的示威，这两天来已迅速扩展到美伪集团暂时统治下的其他城市。
    据西方通讯社报道，近两天来，南越美伪统治区人民反对美国和阮高其傀儡集团的怒潮，已从西贡、岘港、顺化迅速扩展到归仁、芽庄、大叻、芹苴以及中部高原的波来古、昆嵩、邦美蜀等主要城市。这些城市的大批学生和市民举行了示威游行和罢课。波来古、昆嵩和邦美蜀等城市的学校因学生罢课都关了门。芽庄一所学校的示威学生还在校园周围筑起壁垒，以便在傀儡当局镇压时进行自卫。
    在西贡、岘港、顺化这三个大城市内，局势继续十分紧张。西方通讯社说，在这三个城市人民举行的大规模反美示威中，“出现了更加强烈的反美气氛”，“反美色彩越来越浓厚”，特别是在岘港，“反美情绪达到了新的高潮”。
    在已陷入瘫痪状态的岘港，继两千多人三月三十一日高举“越南是越南人的越南”和“我们抗议美国人的侵略行为”等标语牌举行示威游行后，四月二日又有上万人上街举行了大规模的示威游行和集会。
    据合众国际社发自岘港的报道，美国驻岘港“领事”一日也承认，“这里的反政府（傀儡政权）示威有‘美国佬滚回去’的调子”。岘港的美军人员和美国人已奉命“不要上街”。顺化这两天来也接连爆发了群众示威和集会。
    芹苴市的人民也举行了大规模的反美示威。路透社一日发自芹苴的消息说：“在示威中反美色彩愈来愈浓厚。昨天示威中有一个演说者说：‘美国在压迫我们——打倒美国人’。”
    在反美浪潮席卷美伪集团统治城市的情况下，美国和阮高其集团非常惊慌不安。阮高其集团在三月三十一日急忙派出伪“国家领导委员会”秘书长范春沼带着警察头子到岘港去策划镇压群众示威。范春沼到达岘港以后不仅无法平息人民的怒火，反而被示威者扣留了三天。阮高其还在一日宣布“一切示威和罢工为非法”，企图为镇压人民的反抗制造借口。但是连美国通讯社都担心美国费了很大力气才勉强维持下来的阮高其傀儡政权是否能维持下去。
    合众国际社承认，阮高其已陷入走投无路的困境：要么“不得不使用武力来制止示威而使人民激怒起来，以致他们将在街上发动暴乱”，要么“让示威继续举行，而美国人将由于反美浪潮高涨而迫使他下台”。
    据新华社二日讯　华盛顿消息：最近在南越各大城市爆发的一系列反对美国及其走狗的群众大示威，使约翰逊政府大伤脑筋。
    负责公共事务的助理国务卿帮办麦克洛斯基一日在他每天例行的新闻传达会上发表声明说：“总的说来，南越最近发生的情况是美国有些不安的事。我们的大使馆一直在使我们了解这些情况发展。”
    《纽约时报》一日发表一篇题为《西贡的不安和华盛顿》的文章，承认美国在南越的日子越来越不好过。
    文章说，美国既担心阮高其被推翻，又害怕“如果美国过多地支持阮高其政府，这可能会加重某些示威中已经表现出来的反美情绪”。
    文章透露，美国正在悄悄地进行干涉，帮助阮高其“度过难关”。（附图片）
