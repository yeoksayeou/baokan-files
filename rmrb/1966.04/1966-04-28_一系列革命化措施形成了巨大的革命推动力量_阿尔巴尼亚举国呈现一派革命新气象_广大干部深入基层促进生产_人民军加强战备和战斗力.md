    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 27th—Our correspondent reports: A series of major revolutionary measures taken by the Albanian Labor Party Central Committee and the Council of Ministers in recent times have already formed a huge revolutionary driving force within the country. At present, the broad masses of the country are full of vigor and high morale, striving to implement these revolutionary measures, and the whole country is presenting a revolutionary new atmosphere everywhere.
    In October 1965, the Albanian Labor Party Central Committee and the Council of Ministers issued a public announcement calling on the people of the whole country to actively participate in the discussion and formulation of the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1966-1970). In March of this year, the Labor Party Central Committee issued an open letter to the people of the whole country, announcing a series of major revolutionary measures taken in the recent period. These include: opposing bureaucracy, streamlining institutions, strengthening the grassroots and the production front line, lowering high wages, restoring the system of political commissars and party committees at all levels in the army, abolishing military ranks, and so on. The open letter of the Labor Party Central Committee pointed out that "these measures are issues of great principle significance, which are related to people's world outlook and political and ideological growth."
    For several months, the Albanian Labor Party has widely mobilized the entire party, the entire people, and the entire army to study and discuss the announcement and open letter of the Party Central Committee and the Council of Ministers, greatly enhancing the political consciousness of the broad masses of cadres and masses, and their revolutionary enthusiasm has been unprecedentedly high. They warmly support the revolutionary measures taken by the Party and the government and guarantee to fight for the implementation of these revolutionary measures.
    On the basis of strengthening the production front line and streamlining institutions, the work of grassroots organizations and the production front line has been greatly strengthened. The Albanian Labor Party Central Committee has sent Party and government leading cadres, including members of the Political Bureau and members of the Central Committee, and other senior cadres to work at the grassroots level. Up to now, about 50 percent of the staff of the central government organs and more than 10 percent of the staff of the district government organs have enthusiastically responded to the Party's call and gone to the grassroots units or the production front line. The leading bodies of various state-owned economic enterprises have also taken resolute measures to reduce non-production personnel by 15 to 25 percent. After a large number of cadres were transferred to the grassroots level, they went deep into production, deep into the masses, appeared as ordinary laborers, played an exemplary role in production, and left a good impression among the masses.
    In order to realize the combat task put forward by the Labor Party Central Committee to make agriculture the basic sector of the national economy, vigorously develop agricultural and animal husbandry production, especially to strive for food self-sufficiency, the broad masses of peasants carried forward the spirit of hard struggle, turned the winter slack season into a busy winter season, and launched a vigorous winter production campaign. Peasants in many areas vigorously collected organic fertilizer, built water conservancy projects, and deeply plowed the land. Peasants in mountainous areas learned from China's Dazhai experience, vigorously reclaimed wasteland and built terraced fields. In some agricultural cooperatives, the amount of wasteland reclaimed in a few months has exceeded more than double the total amount of wasteland reclaimed in the past eight years. A large number of cadres and agricultural experts, full of revolutionary enthusiasm for building a new socialist countryside, have moved to the countryside to settle down. In the districts of Shkodër, Tirana, Vlorë, Fier and others alone, more than 3,000 cadres and leading members of agricultural cooperatives have voluntarily taken up agricultural production posts and become ordinary agricultural laborers. Under the leadership and promotion of the cadres sent to the lower levels, the production enthusiasm of the members of agricultural cooperatives in various places has been greatly improved.
    The major measures taken by the Albanian Labor Party and the government, such as establishing party committees in the armed forces, re-establishing political commissars, and abolishing military ranks, have been enthusiastically supported by commanders and fighters at all levels. In the discussion, they realized that the implementation of these revolutionary measures will help promote the further revolutionization of the People's Army and better carry forward its fine revolutionary traditions, help improve the political and ideological awareness of commanders and fighters at all levels, and thus strengthen the armed forces' combat readiness and combat effectiveness. Commanders and fighters at all levels have pledged to respond to the call of the Party and the government with practical actions, strengthen preparations politically, ideologically, organizationally and militarily, maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance, and strive to defend the motherland's national defense and socialist construction.
    The series of major revolutionary measures taken by the Labor Party have aroused the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and workers in factories and enterprises. Leading cadres of many enterprises went deep into the grassroots level and personally led the production struggle on the production front line. The broad masses of workers have put forward various production initiatives and rationalization proposals. In the Tirana district alone, workers have put forward more than 26,700 suggestions. More than 1,300 of the suggestions put forward by the working people in the Durrës district have been adopted; more than 1,000 of the suggestions put forward by the workers in the Fier district have also been adopted. These suggestions have played a great role in improving work and promoting production. For example, thanks to the adoption of more than 100 suggestions put forward by the workers at the Fier Thermal Power Plant construction site, the first-quarter construction plan was overfulfilled by 7 percent.
    Driven by the Party's revolutionary measures, the work style of cadres in various places has changed greatly, and a new trend of loving labor and striving to participate in physical labor has emerged. Leading cadres of factories in various places have formulated a system for participating in physical labor. The leaders of the Durrës Agricultural Machinery Factory decided that each person must participate in physical labor for one day a week, and stipulated that there must be a leader on duty and participate in labor with the workers every night shift. In January of this year, the leading members of the Troshanë Agricultural Cooperative in the Lezhë district proposed that agricultural cooperative cadres should complete at least 100 working days each year. This initiative was responded to by cadres of agricultural cooperatives in various places.
    At the same time, the broad masses of cadres in various cities have also vigorously promoted the trend of voluntary labor. They use Sundays or after-work hours to participate in various physical labor. Cadres in the Tirana district decided to use 10,000 working days of voluntary labor to dig an irrigation canal that is 16 kilometers long.
    In the upsurge of revolutionization, a thriving atmosphere has also emerged in cultural, educational, and artistic departments. In February of this year, more than 40 well-known writers and artists responded to the Party's call, went deep into the grassroots level, experienced life, and helped the people carry out cultural and recreational and creative activities. Some people have already created new works with modern life as the theme and full of revolutionary atmosphere. At present, a mass movement to sing revolutionary songs is being carried out in the vast rural areas and factories. The professional troupes in various places not only go to the countryside to perform for the peasants, but also go deep into the countryside with school teachers to help and guide the cultural activities of the peasants.
    Under the leadership of the Labor Party headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, the heroic Albanian people are courageously advancing on the road of revolutionization, and they are determined to build their beloved motherland into a prosperous and strong socialist country.

    一系列革命化措施形成了巨大的革命推动力量
    阿尔巴尼亚举国呈现一派革命新气象
    广大干部深入基层促进生产　人民军加强战备和战斗力
    新华社地拉那二十七日电本社记者报道：阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央和部长会议最近时期以来所采取的一系列重大革命措施，已经在国内形成一股巨大的革命推动力量。目前，全国广大群众意气风发，斗志昂扬，为执行这些革命化措施而努力，全国到处呈现出一派革命的新气象。
    一九六五年十月，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央和部长会议发表了号召全国人民积极参加讨论和制定第四个五年计划（一九六六——一九七○年）的文告。今年三月，劳动党中央又发表了致全国人民的公开信，公布了最近一个时期内所采取的一系列重大革命化措施。其中包括：反对官僚主义，精简机构，充实基层和加强生产第一线，降低高工资，在军队中恢复政治委员和各级党委制度、取消军衔，等等。劳动党中央的公开信指出，“这些措施是具有重大原则意义的问题，它们关系到人们的世界观和政治思想上的成长。”
    几个月来，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党广泛发动全党、全民、全军学习和讨论党中央和部长会议的文告和公开信，使广大干部和群众的政治觉悟大大提高，革命热情空前高涨。他们热烈拥护党和政府所采取的革命化措施，并且保证为贯彻这些革命化措施而奋斗。
    在加强生产第一线和精简机构的基础上，基层组织和生产第一线的工作已大大加强。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央派遣了包括政治局委员、中央委员在内的党政领导干部和其他高级干部到基层工作。到目前为止，中央政府机关大约百分之五十的工作人员和区级政府机关百分之十以上的工作人员，热烈响应党的号召，走上了基层单位或走上了生产第一线。各个国营经济企业的领导机构也采取坚决措施，缩减了非生产人员百分之十五到二十五。大批干部下放到基层后，深入生产，深入群众，以普通劳动者的姿态出现，在生产中起模范带头作用，在群众中留下了良好的印象。
    为了实现劳动党中央提出的把农业作为国民经济的基础部门，大力发展农、牧业生产，特别是争取粮食自给的战斗任务，广大农民发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，变冬闲为冬忙，开展了热火朝天的冬季大生产运动。许多地区的农民大力收集有机肥料，兴修水利和深耕土地。山区的农民学习中国的大寨经验，大力开垦荒地和兴修梯田。有的农业社在几个月内所开的荒地，就超过了过去八年开荒总量的一倍以上。大批干部和农业专家，满怀建设社会主义新农村的革命热情，纷纷到农村安家落户。单是斯库台、地拉那、发罗拉、费里等区，就有三千多名干部和农业合作社的领导成员自愿走上农业生产岗位，成为普通的农业劳动者。在下放干部的带头和推动下，各地农业社社员的生产积极性大大提高。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府所采取的在武装部队中建立党委会，重新设立政治委员和取消军衔等重大措施，受到了各级指战员的热情拥护。他们在讨论中认识到，贯彻这些革命化措施，有助于促进人民军进一步革命化和更好地发扬优良的革命传统，有助于提高各级指战员的政治思想觉悟，进而加强武装部队的战斗准备和战斗力。各级指挥员和战斗员纷纷保证，要以实际行动响应党和政府的号召，在政治、思想、组织和军事上加强准备，保持高度革命警惕性，为保卫祖国的国防和社会主义建设事业而奋斗。
    劳动党所采取的一系列重大革命化措施，激起了工厂企业的广大干部和工人的革命积极性。许多企业的领导干部深入基层，亲临生产前线领导生产斗争。广大的职工纷纷提出各种生产倡议和合理化建议。单是地拉那区的职工就提出了二万六千七百多项建议。都拉斯区劳动人民提出的建议中，已有一千三百多项得到采纳；费里区的职工提出的建议，也被采纳了一千多项。这些建议对改进工作、推动生产都起了很大的作用。例如，费里热电站建筑工地由于采纳了工人提出的一百多项建议，第一季度建设计划超额完成百分之七。
    在党的革命化措施的推动下，各地干部的作风有了很大的改变，出现了热爱劳动、努力参加体力劳动的新风尚。各地工厂的领导干部已经订出了参加体力劳动的制度。都拉斯农业机械厂领导决定，每人每周必须参加一天体力劳动，并且规定每天夜班必须有一个领导人同工人一起值班并参加劳动。今年一月间，莱希区特罗夏纳农业合作社领导成员提出，农业社干部每年至少完成一百个劳动日，这个倡议得到了各地农业合作社干部的响应。
    与此同时，各城市的广大干部还大兴义务劳动之风。他们利用星期天或下班后的时间参加各种体力劳动。地拉那区的干部决定用一万个劳动日的义务劳动来挖掘一条长达十六公里的灌溉渠。
    在革命化的热潮中，文化教育和艺术等部门也出现了欣欣向荣的气象。今年二月，四十多位著名的作家和艺术家响应党的号召，深入基层，体验生活，并帮助人民群众开展文娱和创作活动。有的人已经创作出了以现代生活为主题的、充满了革命气息的新作品。目前，在广大农村和工厂中正在开展一个群众性大唱革命歌曲的运动。各地的职业剧团不仅下乡为农民演出，而且还和学校教师一道，深入农村，帮助和指导农民的文化活动。
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的劳动党的领导下，正在革命化的道路上奋勇前进，他们决心把自己亲爱的祖国建设成为一个繁荣富强的社会主义国家。
