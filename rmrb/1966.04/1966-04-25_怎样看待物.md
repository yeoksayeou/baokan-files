    How to View Material Things
    The state's support is the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's deep concern for us, and a manifestation of the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. How to view material things, how to use them well? There is a struggle between two ideologies here.
    Our Pinglu County Party Committee has had profound lessons in the past in handling the relationship between politics and production, and between people and material things.
    Pinglu County is located outside Yanmen Pass in Shanxi, a loess hilly area with vast land and barren soil, and an old revolutionary base area. Due to the enemy's devastation and destruction during the war, and frequent natural disasters after liberation, there were many difficulties. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao gave infinite care to the masses of our county, and the state supplied more than 100 million jin of grain over the past ten years. Water conservancy loans and relief funds totaled 28 million yuan, as well as a considerable amount of cotton, cloth, and other materials. If these things were truly used well, they would have greatly promoted rural construction and better consolidated and developed the collective economy. However, because we did not do a good job in political work, some cadres and masses developed a serious sense of dependence. They said things like "If we lack food, we have old yellow (corn), if we lack cotton, we have the bank." They did not display the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, and could not change the backward appearance of low production for a long time. At the same time, some spontaneous tendencies of capitalism also gradually spread.
    For a long time, we did not look for the reasons in our leadership's thinking, but wrongly believed that the masses were backward. Last year, the County Party Committee seriously studied Chairman Mao's works and realized that the main reason for this situation was that we did not give prominence to politics in our work.
    Looking for the reasons in our leadership's thinking
    Does the state give grain and money and then generate a dependence on thought? No.
    Chairman Mao said: We must look at the essence of things. The state's support embodies the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's deep concern for the people of old and mountainous areas, and is a powerful support for us to change our poor and blank state, and is a manifestation of the unparalleled superiority of our socialist system. However, our eyes were only on bags of grain and bolts of cloth. We were always carrying the "burden" of being poor, old revolutionary base area, and prone to many disasters, believing that the conditions were not good, ten disasters in ten years, and the masses' living conditions were weak, and that the state would not be able to help us. We did not use the political significance of the state's material support, and did not use Chairman Mao's teaching of "Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory" to inspire the masses to build a new socialist mountainous area with self-reliance and hard work.
    Last year, after we realized this truth, we highlighted the political significance of this material support on various occasions. We spoke extensively to grassroots cadres and the masses about Chairman Mao's care for the people of old and disaster-stricken areas, and about how the people of old areas should further carry forward the tradition and strive to build a new socialist countryside.
    In this way, the situation has changed significantly. In the past, no matter how much relief grain and funds were distributed, there were still many opinions at the lower levels; last year, not much was distributed, but the enthusiasm of the masses was very high, and the basic construction of farmland was better than in any previous year, with more than 45,000 mu of high-quality Dazhai-type fields built.
    It can be seen that the most fundamental reason for the emergence of dependence is that we did not give prominence to politics when using the state's support materials.
    The County Party Committee first revolutionized the life of dependent thought
    Is it that only the masses have dependent thinking and the leaders do not? No. In the past, we wrongly believed that "the masses' dependent thinking is serious and a bottomless pit," and we did not see the great socialist enthusiasm contained in the masses, so we also had a dependent mentality on the state and the higher authorities. After studying Chairman Mao's works, we suddenly woke up to the fact that the root of dependent thinking was not in the masses but in the County Party Committee. If the body is not upright, the shadow will be crooked. If the County Party Committee has dependent thinking, so will the masses.
    Our County Party Committee first revolutionized the life of dependent thought, and the situation has changed. The vast number of cadres and the masses have said: Now that we are engaged in construction, the state still needs to supply us every year, and it is time to change this situation. When cadres and the masses raised their awareness, they worked hard with self-reliance. In the twelve years since the collectivization of the Taocun Commune, the state has given 9,300 yuan, twelve waterwheels, and boiler-towing machines, and only developed more than 250 mu of irrigated land, an average increase of 20 mu per year. Last year, relying on self-reliance, they moved 70,000 cubic meters of earth and 6,000 cubic meters of stone in three months, bypassing seventeen hillsides, and built more than 800 mu of irrigated land. Old commune member Wang Zong said: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, you are truly a great leader. You say that you can change the sky, and you can change the earth. We would not have dared to think about it in the old society!"
    Tasting the sweetness of highlighting politics
    In the final analysis, it is because we cannot correctly treat the state's support, and we have not put the relationship between politics and economics in the right place. We wrongly believed that if we want to highlight politics, it is the matter of economic departments and business enterprises, not the problem of the Party committee organs. Chairman Mao said: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor. The decisive factor is people, not things." Upon careful examination, we did not grasp people as the decisive factor. We put a lot of effort into grasping things, and a little slack in grasping politics. As a result, the more we grasped things, the more problems there were at the lower levels. Liujiajing Brigade is a village that has always lacked water. In 1961, the state sent a drilling machine and spent more than 10,000 yuan without finding water. In 1963, the state gave another 1,900 yuan in subsidies, but they used the money to build houses and repair opera stages. As a result, new water wells could not be dug, and even the old dry wells collapsed a lot, leaving only nine out of forty. Last year, we first spoke extensively to the masses of this team about the revolutionary thought of starting a business for the collective. After half a month of in-depth and meticulous mobilization and organizational work, the masses raised their awareness and immediately completed five shallow wells and a reservoir, basically solving the problem of water for people and animals.
    We have tasted enough of the bitterness of highlighting things, and we have begun to taste the sweetness of highlighting politics. Bitterness and sweetness have given us extremely profound education, and we have a further understanding of Chairman Mao's teachings that politics is the commander and the soul. In the future, we must always highlight politics, so that the socialist construction of the old areas will catch up with the advanced level as soon as possible, so that we will not fail the care and requirements of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao for the people of the revolutionary base areas.

### 怎样看待物

专栏：怎样正确认识和处理政治与生产的关系？

    怎样看待物
    国家的支援是党中央和毛主席对我们的深切关怀，是社会主义制度无比优越的表现，怎样看待物，怎样用好物？这里边有两种思想的斗争
    我们平鲁县委过去在处理政治和生产、人和物的关系上，是有深刻教训的。
    平鲁县位于山西雁门关外，是地广土瘠的黄土丘陵山区，是革命老根据地。由于战争时期敌人的摧残破坏，解放后自然灾害又比较频繁，困难较多。党中央和毛主席对我县群众曾给予无限的关怀，十多年来国家供应了一亿多斤粮食。水利贷款、救济款共二千八百万元，还有棉、布等不少物资。如果真正用好这些东西，本来会大大促进农村的建设，更好地巩固和发展集体经济。但是，由于我们没有做好政治工作，一些干部和群众因此滋长了严重的依赖思想。说什么“缺吃的有老黄（玉米），缺花的有银行”，没有发挥自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，长期不能改变低产落后面貌。同时，有些地方资本主义的自发倾向，也逐渐泛滥起来。
    长期以来，我们没有从领导思想上找原因，反而错误地认为群众落后。去年，县委认真学习了毛主席著作，才认识到造成这种情况的主要原因，是我们在工作中没有突出政治。	  从领导思想上找原因
    是不是国家给了粮食和钱，就会产生依赖思想？不是的。
    毛主席说：我们看事情要看它的实质。国家的支援体现党中央和毛主席对老区、对山区人民的深切关怀，是对我们改变一穷二白面貌的强大支持，是我们的社会主义制度无比优越的表现。但是，我们的眼睛仅仅放在一袋袋粮食、一匹匹布上面。我们老背着一穷、二老、三多灾的“包袱”，认为条件不好，十年十灾，群众生活底子薄，国家不扶持过不去。没有用国家物质支援的政治意义，用毛主席“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的教导，去启发群众自力更生、奋发图强建设社会主义新山区的革命干劲。
    去年，我们认识了这个道理之后，就在各种场合把这种物质支援的政治意义突出出来。向基层干部、群众大讲毛主席对老区、灾区人民的关怀，大讲老区人民应当进一步发扬传统，应当奋发图强建设社会主义新农村。
    这样，情况就有了显著的变化。过去，发放的救济粮款再多，下边仍有很多意见；去年发放的不多，群众干劲却很高涨，农田基本建设比过去哪一年都好，建成质量较高的大寨田四万五千多亩。
    可见，产生依赖思想，最根本的是由于我们在使用国家支援物资时，没有突出政治。	  县委先革依赖思想的命
    是不是依赖思想只是群众有，领导没有呢？不是的。过去，我们错误地认为“群众依赖思想严重，是填不满的坑”，看不见群众中蕴藏着极大的社会主义的积极性，因而也对国家对上级有了依赖心理。经过学习毛主席的著作，才猛醒过来，依赖思想的根源不在群众而在县委，身不正影子斜，县委有依赖思想，群众也就有依赖思想。
    我们县委首先革掉了依赖思想的命，情况就有了变化。广大干部和群众纷纷说：如今搞建设，还要国家年年供应，是该改变这种情况的时候了。干部和群众提高了觉悟，就自力更生地干起来了。陶村公社集体化十二年来，国家给了九千三百元，十二台水车和锅驼机，才搞了二百五十多亩水地，平均每年增加二十亩。去年靠自力更生，三个月动土七万方、开石六千方，绕过十七个山腰，建成水浇地八百多亩。老社员王宗说：“毛主席呀毛主席，你真是伟大的领袖，说能改天就能改天，说能换地就能换地，要是在旧社会，我们想也不敢想呀！”	  尝到突出政治的甜头
    归根到底，是我们不能正确对待国家的支援，是我们没有把政治和经济的关系摆对头。我们错误地以为：要说突出政治，那是经济部门、事业企业部门的事，不是党委机关的问题。毛主席说：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”认真检查起来，我们的确没有把人作为决定性的因素来抓。抓物的劲大，抓政治的劲就有点松。结果，越抓物，下边问题越多。刘家穽大队是个一向缺水吃的村子。一九六一年，国家送去钻探机，花了一万多元没有闹出水来。一九六三年，国家又给了一千九百元补助款，他们却用这些钱盖房，修戏台。结果，新水井打不出来，连过去的旱井也坍毁了不少，四十眼只剩了九眼。去年，我们首先向这个队的群众大讲为集体创业的革命思想，经过半月深入细致的发动组织工作，群众觉悟提高了，一下子打成五眼浅井和一个蓄水池，基本上解决了人畜的用水问题。
    突出物的苦头我们尝够了，突出政治的甜头开始尝到了。苦和甜给予我们极为深刻的教育，我们对毛主席教导的政治是统帅、是灵魂有了进一步的认识。今后，我们一定要永远突出政治，使老区的社会主义建设尽快赶上先进的水平，这样才不会辜负党中央和毛主席对革命根据地人民的关怀和要求。山西平鲁县委代理书记
