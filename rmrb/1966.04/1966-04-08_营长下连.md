    Company commander goes down to the company,
    With "The Three Constantly Read Articles" tucked in his breast.
    If you ask how well he's learned,
    Hey! He's really *zhen zhan*! (Note)
    At application meetings,
    He's always the first to speak.
    Been tempered in the flames of war for so many years,
    He still says,
    "Ah! I must also wage war against selfishness!"
    A man in his forties,
    Still takes aim with us,
    Swings his arm to throw grenades.
    He says:
    "I must do revolution like this for the rest of my life!"
    When we have problems,
    He worries.
    Even though he's only been down to the company for half a month,
    He's got our tempers and dispositions all figured out.
    Under the lamp,
    He studies with us,
    Under the moonlight,
    He talks with us.
    To dye us bright red,
    He goes through Chairman Mao's books to find the answer.
    We say,
    "The company commander really cares about us."
    He says:
    "Without you, who will take over!"
    Our company commander goes down to the company,
    Livingly studies and applies "The Three Constantly Read Articles."
    Looking at how the company commander thinks of himself,
    We have a model for learning.
    Note: “真沾” "Zhen zhan" is a Hebei dialect, meaning "really good."

    营长下连
    公安部队某部　张立源
    俺们营长下连，
    怀里揣着“老三篇”。
    要问学的咋样？
    嘿！真沾！（注）
    讲用会上，
    他总是第一个发言。
    炮火中摔打这么多年，
    他却还说，
    “我呀！也得向私心开战！”
    四十来岁的人了，
    还和俺们一起瞄准，
    挥臂投弹。
    他却说：
    “下半辈子革命就得这么干！”
    俺们有了问题，
    他挂念。
    别看他下连才半月，
    俺们的脾气禀性全摸遍。
    灯下，
    和俺们一起学，
    月下，
    和俺们一起谈。
    为了把俺们染成鲜红，
    他翻遍毛主席的书去找答案。
    俺们说，
    “营长对俺们真关心。”
    他却说：
    “没有你们谁接班！”
    俺们营长下连，
    活学活用“老三篇”。
    看看营长想自己，
    俺们学习有了样板。
    注：“真沾”河北方言，意思是真行。
