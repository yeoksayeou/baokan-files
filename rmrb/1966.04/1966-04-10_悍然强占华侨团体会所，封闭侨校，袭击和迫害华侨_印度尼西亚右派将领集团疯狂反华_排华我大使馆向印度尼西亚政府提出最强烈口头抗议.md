    Arrogantly Occupying Overseas Chinese Organizations' Meeting Places, Closing Overseas Chinese Schools, Attacking and Persecuting Overseas Chinese
    Indonesian Right-Wing General Clique Frantically Opposes and Excludes Chinese
    Our Embassy Lodges Strongest Verbal Protest with Indonesian Government Regarding Anti-Chinese Actions
    Xinhua News Agency, April 9th, Jakarta Dispatch: Since the Indonesian right-wing general clique seized power, they have taken a series of frantic anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese actions in Jakarta and other regions of Indonesia, such as forcibly occupying the meeting places of Overseas Chinese organizations, closing Overseas Chinese schools, and attacking and persecuting Overseas Chinese.
    On the morning of April 8th, more than forty thugs, calling themselves "KAMI" ("Indonesian University Students United Action Organization") and "KABI" ("Indonesian Youth and Students United Action Organization"), carrying clubs, daggers and other sharp weapons, broke into the Jakarta Overseas Chinese General Association in jeeps and forcibly occupied the meeting place. They guarded the gate, only allowing people to enter and not leave. They detained about 120 male and female Overseas Chinese, including the vice chairman and staff of the Jakarta Overseas Chinese General Association, and those who came to handle affairs and seek medical treatment. The thugs detained these Overseas Chinese in separate rooms and then interrogated them one by one illegally. Some Overseas Chinese were searched, some were punched and kicked, and some were forced to stand facing the wall as punishment. Huang Muhe, a staff member of the General Association, was illegally arrested for refusing to sign a document regarding the handover of the General Association's property and documents. A female Overseas Chinese who came to handle affairs was also arrested at the same time. All documents of the detained Overseas Chinese were illegally confiscated by the thugs.
    These thugs also wrote anti-Chinese slogans such as "The ownership of the house belongs to 'KAMI' and 'KABI' from 8:05 on April 8th" and "Hang the Chinamen" on the gate and interior walls of the Overseas Chinese General Association. They also detained and forcibly occupied more than 20 cars and motorcycles belonging to the General Association and visiting Overseas Chinese.
    At the same time, the offices of eight other Overseas Chinese organizations in Jakarta were also illegally occupied by thugs.
    On the same day, the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia lodged the strongest verbal protest with the Indonesian government regarding the thugs' attack and illegal occupation of the Jakarta Overseas Chinese General Association and eight other Overseas Chinese organizations.
    Prior to this, the commander of the Fifth Military Region of Indonesia brazenly announced on April 5th the closure of all Overseas Chinese schools in Jakarta and its surrounding areas, and the dissolution of the institutions or foundations that established the schools. This anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese measure has left more than 40,000 Overseas Chinese students and more than 1,400 faculty and staff unemployed and out of school.
    According to reports, the commander of the Surabaya Military District in East Java has also ordered that all Overseas Chinese schools be "placed under protective control." The military authorities in Bogor also announced earlier the closure of all Overseas Chinese schools in the city.
    Recently, thugs organized by Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces have successively forcibly occupied and looted Overseas Chinese organizations and schools in Medan, Lubuk Pakam, Tanjung Karang, Jambi, Cirebon, Pekalongan, Malang, Bandung, Serang, Asahan, Kisaran, Tinggi, Rantau, and other places, and frantically beaten and arrested innocent Overseas Chinese.

    悍然强占华侨团体会所，封闭侨校，袭击和迫害华侨
    印度尼西亚右派将领集团疯狂反华排华
    我大使馆向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈口头抗议
    新华社九日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派将领集团夺取政权以后，在印度尼西亚的首都雅加达和其他地区采取了强占华侨团体的会所、封闭华侨学校、袭击和迫害华侨等一系列的疯狂的反华排华行动。
    四月八日清晨，四十多个自称为“卡米”（“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动组织”）和“卡比”（“印度尼西亚青年学生统一行动组织”）的暴徒，携带木棒、匕首等利器，乘坐吉普车闯入雅加达华侨总会，强行霸占会所。他们把守着大门，对来人只准进不准出。他们前后扣押雅加达华侨总会副主席、干事及前来办理事务、看病的男女华侨约一百二十余人。暴徒把这些华侨分别关押房内，然后逐一进行非法传讯。有的华侨被搜身，有的被拳打脚踢，有的被强行面壁罚站。总会干事黄沐和，因为拒绝签署关于交出总会房产和文件的字据，竟被非法逮捕，同时被捕的还有前来办事的一名华侨妇女。被扣的华侨的所有证件，全部被暴徒非法搜去。
    这些暴徒还在华侨总会大门和室内墙壁上涂写“从四月八日八时零五分起房屋主权属于‘卡米’、‘卡比’”的字样以及“吊死支那人”等反华标语。他们还扣留、强行占有了属于总会和来访华侨的二十多辆汽车和摩托车。
    与此同时，雅加达还有八个华侨团体的办事处也被暴徒非法侵占。
    中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆当天就暴徒袭击和非法占领雅加达华侨总会和其它八个侨团，向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈的口头抗议。
    在这以前，印度尼西亚第五军区司令于四月五日悍然宣布封闭雅加达及其周围地区的全部华侨学校、解散开办各校的机构或基金会。这一反华、排华措施已使四万多名华侨学生和一千四百多名教职员失学、失业。
    另据报道，东爪哇泗水市军分区司令也已下令把所有的华侨学校“置于保护性管制下”。茂物市军事当局早些时候也宣布封闭这个城市的所有华侨学校。
    最近一个时期以来，印度尼西亚右派反动势力组织的暴徒先后在棉兰、鹿勿洞、丹戎加冷、占碑、井里汶、北加浪岸、玛琅、万隆、西冷、亚沙汗、奇沙兰、丁宜、兰都等地，强行占领和抢劫侨团、侨校，疯狂殴打和逮捕无辜华侨。
