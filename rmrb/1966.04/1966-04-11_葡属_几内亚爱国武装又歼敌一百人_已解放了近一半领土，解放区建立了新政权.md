    “Portuguese” Guinea Patriotic Armed Forces Eliminate Another 100 Enemy Soldiers
    Liberated Nearly Half of the Territory, New Regime Established in Liberated Areas
    Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, 6th. The African Independence Party of Guinea and Cape Verde office in Algeria issued a communique on the 6th, stating that in numerous battles in February, the patriotic armed forces of "Portuguese" Guinea eliminated approximately one hundred Portuguese colonial soldiers.
    They sank a vessel of the Portuguese colonialists in the Manzoe River. They also destroyed six enemy trucks in the fighting.
    The communique stated that from February 2nd to March 2nd, the patriotic armed forces strengthened their activities on all fronts, especially in the north and south. They thwarted the Portuguese colonial army's conspiracy to destroy the northern central base of the patriotic armed forces.
    Xinhua News Agency, Conakry. The Guinean newspaper "Liberation" recently published an article entitled "Three Years of Struggle in Guinea (Bissau)," stating that the patriotic armed forces of "Portuguese" Guinea have already controlled nearly half of their country's territory. 15,000 fighters equipped with light weapons and mortars are fighting alongside the insurgent people.
    The article listed many victories achieved by the fighters of the African Independence Party of Guinea and Cape Verde since January 1963. It said that in the liberated areas, new organs of political power have been established. These institutions have restored normal life for the people, guaranteed their safety, and stabilized the economy.
    The article said that Portugal has sent 20,000 colonial troops to conduct military operations to slaughter African patriots. They are commanded by the Portuguese Minister of Interior, Schultz, a disciple of Hitler, and possess the most modern weapons manufactured by the United States, West Germany, Britain, and Italy, including American jet bombers and destroyers. However, Salazar's army cannot enter the liberated areas. They are chased by guerrillas everywhere, stepping on landmines and ambushes. They can only obtain supplies by air transport.

    “葡属”几内亚爱国武装又歼敌一百人
    已解放了近一半领土，解放区建立了新政权
    新华社阿尔及尔电　几内亚和佛得角非洲独立党驻阿尔及利亚办事处六日发表公报说，在二月份多次战斗中，“葡属”几内亚爱国武装歼灭了葡萄牙殖民军约一百人。
    他们在芒佐厄河击沉了葡萄牙殖民主义者的船只一艘。他们在战斗中还击毁了敌人的六辆卡车。
    公报说，从二月二日到三月二日，爱国武装在各条战线上、特别在北部和南部加强了活动。他们挫败了葡萄牙殖民军企图摧毁爱国武装北部中央基地的阴谋。
    据新华社科纳克里电　几内亚《自由报》最近发表一篇题为《几内亚（比绍）斗争的三年》的文章说，“葡属”几内亚的爱国武装已经控制了他们国家的将近一半的领土。拥有轻武器和迫击炮的一万五千名战士正在同起义人民一起战斗。
    文章列举了几内亚和佛得角非洲独立党的战士从一九六三年一月以来所取得的许多胜利。它说，在解放了的地区，已经建立了新的政权机构，这些机构恢复了人民正常的生活，保障了人民的安全和稳定了经济。
    文章说，葡萄牙派了两万名殖民军进行屠杀非洲爱国者的军事行动。他们是由葡萄牙内政部长、希特勒的门徒舒尔茨总督指挥的，拥有美国、西德、英国和意大利制造的最现代化的武器，包括美国喷气式轰炸机和驱逐机。但是，萨拉查的军队不能进入解放区。他们到处受到游击队员的追击，踩了地雷和遭到伏击。他们只能靠空运取得补给。
