    A Major Victory for China's Peaceful Diplomatic Policy
    ——Welcome Chairman Liu Shaoqi Back from His Foreign Visit
    Chairman Liu Shaoqi, accompanied by Vice Premier Chen Yi, has successfully concluded his visit to Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Burma and returned to Kunming. The Chinese people, with immense excitement, warmly congratulate Chairman Liu on the great achievements of this visit and warmly welcome Chairman Liu Shaoqi's victorious return.
      Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Burma are China's close neighbors. The peoples of these three countries have long enjoyed a deep traditional friendship with the Chinese people. Chairman Liu Shaoqi's visit has further strengthened the friendly and cooperative relations between China and its friendly neighbors and enhanced the friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of Asian countries. This will have a far-reaching impact on consolidating and developing the Asian unity against imperialism and on safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.
    The great achievements of Chairman Liu Shaoqi's visit are another major victory for China's peaceful diplomatic policy.
    It is undeniable that differences exist in the social systems of China and the Asian-African nationalist countries. However, these differences cannot negate our common experiences and common plight, nor can they negate our common aspirations and common demands. Precisely because of this, with the exception of countries ruled by a very small number of reactionary nationalists, China and the vast majority of Asian-African countries are fully capable of uniting and cooperating and living together in friendship. China's relations with Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Burma are a good example.
    Since the very first day of its birth, the People's Republic of China has consistently pursued a socialist peaceful diplomatic policy. This policy is clearly stipulated in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. In 1954, our government initiated the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. In 1955, together with the Asian and African countries participating in the Bandung Conference, we jointly formulated the Ten Principles on the basis of the Five Principles. In 1963, China formulated the Five Principles for mutual relations with African and Arab countries. In 1964, we formulated Eight Principles for China's foreign aid. Our interactions with Asian and African countries are guided by the above-mentioned principles.
    China firmly maintains that all countries, large and small, should be equal and opposes large countries oppressing small countries, opposes a small number of large countries manipulating international affairs, and opposes great-power chauvinism in any form. China never interferes in the internal affairs of other countries and never imposes its own views on others, because the affairs of each country should and can only be decided by the people of that country themselves. China believes that in the struggle against imperialist aggression, for the maintenance of national independence and sovereignty, and for the defense of Asian and world peace, the peoples of all countries support each other. China's support for the just struggles of the peoples of all countries is our bounden internationalist duty, and we will never demand any reward from other countries for this; on the contrary, we regard the just struggles of the peoples of all countries as a huge support for China, a support that cannot be calculated by measurement. Similarly, in the economic field, China provides assistance to Asian and African countries to the best of its ability, and this assistance is mutual and beneficial to both parties. We never regard it as a unilateral bestowal. These principles of China in handling relations with Asian and African countries and other countries have been universally approved and welcomed by the peoples of all countries.
    During Chairman Liu Shaoqi's visit abroad, the governments, peoples, and public opinion of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Burma gave high praise to China's peaceful diplomatic policy. The warm welcome that Chairman Liu Shaoqi received in the three friendly neighboring countries strongly demonstrates that the friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of Asian and African countries has a solid foundation.
    For a long time, imperialism headed by the United States and all reactionaries have tried to undermine the friendly relations between China and Asian-African countries and undermine the deep friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of Asian and African countries. Facts have proven and will continue to prove that this conspiracy is difficult to succeed.
    U.S. imperialism and its followers slander China as "belligerent," attempting to distort the image of China, which pursues a peaceful diplomatic policy, in the eyes of the people of the world. The only "basis" they can find is that the Chinese people resolutely support the just struggles of the peoples of all countries. Let us frankly answer them: Whether it is U.S. imperialism or other imperialism, whether it is Indian expansionists, whether it is the reactionaries of any country, as long as you engage in aggression or anti-people criminal activities, the Chinese people will not hesitate to stand on the side of the invaded countries and on the side of the peoples of all countries engaged in just struggles, and give them resolute support. No matter how great the risks and pressures China faces, it will not change this position.
    U.S. imperialism and its followers are also sparing no effort to sow discord between Asian-African countries and China, attempting to trap China in "isolation." This is also wishful thinking. The broad masses of the people in Asian and African countries demand the maintenance of national independence and sovereignty, demand the further elimination of the remaining forces of imperialism, and demand the development of national economies and national cultures. This universal demand of the Asian-African people reflects the inevitable trend of historical development and is difficult for any force to resist. The people of independent Asian-African countries are absolutely unwilling to see their motherlands fall back into the status of colonies and semi-colonies. China's peaceful diplomatic policy is completely in line with this historical trend and in line with the fundamental interests of Asian-African countries and Asian-African people. The Chinese people share the same breath and the same destiny with the Asian-African people. How can U.S. imperialism trap China in "isolation"? The opposite is true. In the Asian-African region, it is not China that is isolated, but U.S. imperialism. For more than ten years, U.S. imperialism has been building what it calls a "crescent-shaped encirclement" around China. To be honest, this "encirclement" is nothing more than a wall made of paper. It can neither politically contain the huge influence of China's peaceful diplomatic policy nor play any significant military role. The so-called "encirclement" is actually a noose that U.S. imperialism has put around its own neck.
    The grand and warm welcome that Chairman Liu Shaoqi received in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Burma is another test of our peaceful diplomatic policy. It proves that our foreign policy is completely correct. The anti-China adverse current recently stirred up by imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries at great cost has not harmed China in the slightest. The fact remains: China has friends all over the world. The friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of Asia, Africa, and other countries in the world will be further consolidated and developed. The Chinese people will, as always, unite with the Asian-African people and the people of all countries in the world, and resolutely fight to the end against the U.S. imperialist policies of aggression and war, and to defend peace in Asia, Africa, and the world!

### 我国和平外交政策的重大胜利——欢迎刘少奇主席出国访问归来

    我国和平外交政策的重大胜利
    ——欢迎刘少奇主席出国访问归来
    刘少奇主席在陈毅副总理陪同下，已经圆满结束了对巴基斯坦、阿富汗和缅甸的访问，回抵昆明。中国人民怀着万分兴奋的心情，热烈祝贺刘主席这次出访所取得的伟大成就，热烈欢迎刘少奇主席胜利归来。
      巴基斯坦、阿富汗和缅甸，是中国的亲密邻邦。三国人民同中国人民之间，早就存在深厚的传统友谊。刘少奇主席这次出访，进一步加强了中国同友邻国家的友好合作关系，增进了中国人民同亚洲各国人民的友谊。这对巩固和发展亚洲的团结反帝事业，对维护亚洲和世界和平，都将发生深远的影响。
    刘少奇主席这次出访所取得的伟大成就，是我国和平外交政策的又一次重大胜利。
    中国和亚非民族主义国家在社会制度方面存在着差异，这是毋庸讳言的。但是，这些差异，并不能否定我们之间的共同经历和共同遭遇，并不能否定我们之间的共同愿望和共同要求。正是因为这样，除了极少数的反动的民族主义者所统治的国家以外，中国同广大的亚非国家，完全有可能团结合作，友好相处。我国同巴基斯坦、阿富汗、缅甸的关系，就是良好的榜样。
    中华人民共和国自从诞生的第一天起，始终一贯地实行社会主义的和平外交政策。这一政策，在中华人民共和国的宪法中，作了明确的规定。一九五四年，我国政府倡议了著名的和平共处五项原则。一九五五年，我国同参加万隆会议的亚非国家一起，在五项原则的基础上，共同制定了十项原则。一九六三年，我国制定了同非洲国家和阿拉伯国家相互关系的五项原则。一九六四年，又制定了我国对外援助的八项原则。我们同亚非国家之间的交往，就是以上述的这些原则为准绳的。
    中国坚决主张大小国家应该一律平等，反对大国压迫小国，反对少数大国操纵国际事务，反对任何形式的大国主义。中国从不干预别国的内政，决不把自己的意见强加于人，因为各国的事务，应该并且只能由各国人民自己决定。中国认为在反对帝国主义侵略、维护民族独立和主权、保卫亚非和平和世界和平的斗争中，各国人民都是相互支援的。中国支援各国人民的正义斗争，是我们应尽的国际主义义务，我们决不为此而向别的国家索取任何报答；相反，我们把各国人民的正义斗争，看作是对中国的巨大支援，这种支援是不可能用度、量、衡来计算的。同样，在经济方面，中国尽自己可能的力量，对亚非国家提供援助，这种援助也是相互的，对双方都是有利的，我们决不把它看作是单方面的赐予。中国在处理同亚非国家和其他国家关系中的这些原则，得到了各国人民的普遍的赞同和欢迎。
    在刘少奇主席这次出国访问中，巴基斯坦、阿富汗、缅甸的政府、人民和公众舆论，对中国的和平外交政策给予了高度的评价。刘少奇主席在三个友好邻国所受到的热烈欢迎，有力地表明中国人民同亚非各国人民的友谊，是有牢固基础的。
    长时期来，以美国为首的帝国主义和一切反动派，力图破坏中国和亚非国家的友好关系，破坏中国人民同亚非各国人民的深厚友谊。事实证明并将继续证明，这一阴谋是难以得逞的。
    美帝国主义及其追随者，诬蔑中国“好战”，妄图在世界人民的心目中歪曲奉行和平外交政策的中国的形象。它们所能找到的唯一“根据”，是中国人民坚决支持各国人民的正义斗争。让我们坦率地回答它们：不论是美帝国主义或其他帝国主义，不论是印度扩张主义者，不论是哪个国家的反动派，只要你们进行侵略或反人民的罪恶活动，中国人民毫不犹豫地站在被侵略的国家的一边，站在进行正义斗争的各国人民的一边，给以坚决的支持。中国不管要冒多大的风险，受到多大的压力，都不会改变这一立场。
    美帝国主义及其追随者，还不遗余力地挑拨亚非国家同中国的关系，企图使中国陷于“孤立”。这也是枉费心机。亚非国家的广大人民，要求维护国家的独立和主权，要求进一步肃清帝国主义的残余势力，要求发展民族经济和民族文化。亚非人民的这一普遍要求，反映了历史发展的必然趋势，是任何势力所难以阻挡的。亚非独立国家的人民，决不愿意自己的祖国再沦落到殖民地和半殖民地的地位。中国的和平外交政策，完全符合这一历史发展的潮流，符合亚非国家和亚非人民的根本利益。中国人民同亚非人民同呼吸，共命运，美帝国主义怎么可能使中国陷于“孤立”呢？事实恰恰相反，在亚非地区，被孤立的不是中国，而是美帝国主义。十多年来，美帝国主义一直在中国周围建立什么“新月形包围圈”。老实说，这种
  “包围圈”，只不过是纸糊的墙壁。它既不可能在政治上遏制中国和平外交政策的巨大影响，也不可能在军事上起什么了不起的作用。所谓“包围圈”，实际上是美帝国主义给自己套在脖子上的绞索。
    刘少奇主席在巴基斯坦、阿富汗、缅甸所受到的盛大和热烈的欢迎，是对我国和平外交政策的又一次检验。它证明我国的对外政策是完全正确的。帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派最近费了九牛二虎之力掀起的反华逆流，无损于中国的一根毫毛。事实仍然是：中国的朋友遍天下。中国人民同亚非人民和世界各国人民之间的友谊，将会进一步地巩固和发展。中国人民将一如既往，同亚非人民、世界各国人民团结一致，坚决为反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，为保卫亚非和平和世界和平而共同奋斗到底！
