    Under the Guise of Exposing the "Dark Side"	Chu Ruijie Chen Lingguo
    Comrade Wu Han, who has always portrayed emperors, kings, generals, and ministers as the "bright side" of history and opposed "depicting the sinful activities of the feudal ruling class," surprisingly developed a strong interest in exposing the sinful activities of the feudal ruling class during the years when China's national economy encountered temporary difficulties. He began to care, with a show of compassion, about the lives of the "poor and lower-middle peasants," whom he had never paid attention to, saying that they "had achieved nothing in their lives." Just look at how "indignant" he is towards the rulers and how "sympathetic" he is towards the people!
    Please see what Comrade Wu Han wrote:
    In the seventh year of the Daye era of Emperor Yang of Sui, "fields were left uncultivated, and many were abandoned. Coupled with the famine, grain prices soared, and the people could not survive."
    During the time of Kuang Zhong, "the prosperity of this period was only superficial, while severe crises were contained within." "Official land became more and more, and private land became less and less."
    During the time of Hai Rui, "land became even more concentrated," and "peasants' land was seized by landlords, turning them into tenant farmers and serfs, living like beasts of burden." "The annexation by large landlords, the corruption of officials, and the invasion of Japanese pirates made the lives of peasants increasingly difficult. On the surface, there was bustle and prosperity, but beneath the surface lay the suppressed anger of millions of peasants, ready to erupt."
    During the time of Yu Qian, "Yu Qian was sent to inspect Jiangxi and discovered hundreds of unjust cases."
    In Comrade Wu Han's articles, examples like these are abundant and will not be listed one by one. The defender of the "bright side" of history suddenly becomes the exposer of the "dark side" of history. What a contradictory and irreconcilable phenomenon! In fact, Comrade Wu Han was unwilling to smear the faces of his own ancestors. But at this time, Comrade Wu Han had a special need that was inconvenient to express directly. To adapt to this need, exposing the sins of the ruling class became his top priority.
    Since 1958, under the wise leadership of the Party, the Chinese people have achieved great victories and realized a great leap forward at a tremendous pace. "The silver hoes fall on the Five Ridges, connecting the sky, and iron arms shake the Three Rivers, moving the earth"—what a magnificent scene and what heroic spirit! However, right-leaning opportunists viciously attacked the Party and the Three Red Banners, arbitrarily distorting and exaggerating individual shortcomings, while turning a blind eye to the great achievements, negating everything. However, the conspiracy of the right-leaning opportunists did not succeed, and their attack failed completely. The Party and the people "removed" them from their "official positions." After the attack of the right-leaning opportunists was repelled, the class struggle continued, and those who harbored hatred towards the Party and socialism hid themselves, waiting for an opportunity to act. During China's period of temporary difficulties, they thought their chance had come, and in coordination with international reactionaries, they launched a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism, attempting to stage a comeback. At this time, they needed to exaggerate the shortcomings and difficulties in our work as much as possible, oppose the Party, oppose socialism, in order to stage a comeback. Precisely to adapt to this need, Comrade Wu Han talked at length about the sins of the feudal ruling class. In fact, he had absolutely no intention of exposing the dark side of the feudal ruling class, but used it as a pretext to insinuate socialist society and the Party. He adopted obscure, circuitous, and allegorical techniques, describing socialist society as a scene of tragedy and darkness, in order to cheer up the right-leaning opportunists who had been "removed" from their "official positions" and encourage them to try again after their failure.
    Comrade Wu Han's purpose in exposing the "dark side" was only to uglify the Party, uglify the socialist system, and attribute the causes of China's temporary difficulties to the Party's "bureaucratism," "subjectivism," and "dogmatism," thereby directing the spearhead at the Party, socialism, and the Three Red Banners.
    Understanding this, we also understand why Comrade Wu Han, who has always portrayed emperors, kings, generals, and ministers as the "bright side" of history, suddenly talked at length about the sinful activities of the ruling class in the past few years.

    在暴露“黑暗面”的幌子下	楚瑞杰　陈琳国
    一向把帝王将相说成是历史的“光明面”，反对“刻划封建统治阶级的罪恶活动”的吴晗同志，在我国国民经济遭到暂时困难的年月中，一反常态，突然对暴露封建统治阶级的罪恶活动有了浓厚的兴趣，悲天悯人地关心起他从来不放在眼里的“一辈子没有什么成就”的“贫雇农”的生活来了。你看他对统治者有多“愤慨”，对人民有多“同情”！
    请看看吴晗同志写了些什么吧：
    隋焬帝大业七年，“田地无人耕种，很多都荒废了。加上又闹灾荒，粮价飞涨，百姓活不下去了”。
    况钟的时候，“这个时期的全盛都只是表面上的，内部却包含着严重的危机。”“官田就越来越多，民田就越来越少了”。
    海瑞的时候，“土地更加集中了”，“农民的土地被地主侵夺，沦为佃客、庄客，过着牛马般的生活”。“大地主的兼并，官吏的贪污，倭寇的侵略，使得农民生活日益困苦。表面上熙熙攘攘，一片繁荣景象，骨子里却蕴藏着被压抑的千千万万农民的愤怒，一触即发。”
    于谦的时候，“于谦被派巡按江西，发见有几百件冤枉的案件”。
    在吴晗同志的文章中，诸如此类的例子俯拾即是，不再一一列举了。历史“光明面”的捍卫者忽然变成历史“黑暗面”的揭露者了，多么矛盾，多么不调和的现象呀！其实，吴晗同志又何尝愿意在他自己的祖宗脸上抹黑，但是这时，吴晗同志有着一种不便明言的特殊需要。为了适应这种需要，暴露统治阶级的罪恶就成了他的当务之急了。
    一九五八年以来，我国人民在党的英明领导下，取得了伟大的胜利，实现了一日千里的大跃进。“天连五岭银锄落，地动三河铁臂摇”，这是何等壮丽的情景，何等的英雄气概！但是，右倾机会主义分子却对党和三面红旗进行了恶毒的攻击，对个别的缺点加以任意的歪曲、夸大，而对于伟大的成绩却熟视无睹，一概否定。不过，右倾机会主义分子的阴谋并未得逞，他们的进攻彻底失败了，党和人民“罢”了他们的“官”。右倾机会主义分子的进攻被打退了，阶级斗争却依然继续进行，对党对社会主义心怀仇恨的人把自己隐蔽起来，伺机而动。在我国暂时困难的时期，他们以为机会来了，就配合着国际上的反动派，向党、向社会主义进行了猖狂的进攻。在这个时候，他们就需要尽量夸大我们工作中的缺点和困难，反对党，反对社会主义，以图东山再起。正是适应了这种需要，吴晗同志才大谈封建统治阶级的罪恶。其实，他绝对无意于暴露封建统治阶级的黑暗面，而是以此为幌子，来影射着社会主义社会，影射着党。他采用了隐晦曲折、指桑骂槐的手法，把社会主义社会描写成为一片悲惨、阴暗的景象，以便为被“罢”了“官”的右倾机会主义者打气，鼓励他们失败了再干。
    吴晗同志暴露“黑暗面”的目的只是在于丑化党，丑化社会主义制度，把我国暂时困难的原因归结为党的“官僚主义”、“主观主义”、“教条主义”，从而把矛头指向了党和社会主义，指向了三面红旗。
    了解了这点，我们也就懂得一向把帝王将相说成是历史“光明面”的吴晗同志，为什么在前几年忽然大谈统治阶级的罪恶活动了。
