    Black and White Reversed, Enemy and Friend Indistinguishable
    Jie Ping, Chinese People's Liberation Army Academy of Arts
    "Lin Zecun Arrives at the City" is a film that is anti-reality and anti-historical.
    In 1947, Chairman Mao clearly pointed out to us in his article "The Present Situation and Our Tasks": "Now is the time when all enemies at home and abroad are dominated by their pessimistic mood. They sigh and groan, cry out about crisis, and cannot see a shadow of joy." Faced with the overwhelming and irresistible powerful offensive of our People's Liberation Army, although the enemy was struggling desperately, it was impossible to reverse their fate of extinction.
    "Lin Zecun Arrives at the City" is set against this historical stage. But from the film, we cannot see this situation. On the contrary, the enemy, under the pressure of our mighty army, is so calm and composed, firm and composed, not panicking in the face of danger, and even joyfully drinking and celebrating birthdays in the luxurious hall, unable to see the great pressure of our army on the city, and even more unable to see the enemy's trend of extinction. The author of the film completely deviates from Chairman Mao's instructions, insisting on making people believe that the enemy was not mainly forced to revolt and surrender under the circumstances of our army pressing the border and being on the verge of extinction, but that through some internal factional struggles, they would willingly lay down their weapons and surrender to the people. Attempting to create an illusion: thinking that without class struggle, the enemy will disintegrate on its own. This is truly a distortion that reverses black and white and ignores historical facts.
    Chairman Mao instructed us that for the enemy, "the task of revolutionary literary and art workers is to expose their brutality and deception, and point out the trend that they are bound to fail." The author of "Lin Zecun Arrives at the City" completely deviates from Chairman Mao's instructions, beautifying and praising the enemy, portraying the Kuomintang senior military officers Zhao Chongwu and Zheng Hanchen, these rulers riding on the people's heads, as being so dignified and awe-inspiring; loving the country and the people, worrying about the country and hurting the times, and even in the most dangerous situation, what Zhao Chongwu and the others consider is not their personal fate, but the "vitality of the nation" and the "future of the country." This is tantamount to saying that only Zhao Chongwu and the others are the most sympathetic to the sufferings of the people and the most concerned about the fate of the people. He is the loyal spokesperson of the people, and the great liberation war led by the Party is nothing more than a meaningless "struggle between two parties" that disregards the life and death of the people. On the contrary, the film's producers arbitrarily vilify our army's Minister Jiang, such a responsible political work cadre. He is portrayed as a politician who does not talk about the Party's policies, disregards the dignity of revolutionary cadres, and only relies on his silver tongue to persuade. He is so humble in front of the enemy, calling them brothers, and does not dare to fight the reactionaries with righteous indignation. This is truly a malicious slander of our army's political struggle to disintegrate the enemy and a great distortion of the image of revolutionary cadres.
    "Lin Zecun Arrives at the City" distorts the historical truth of the People's Liberation War, negates the decisive role of class struggle, and is a bad film that reverses black and white and confuses the enemy and ourselves. We must seriously criticize it.

    黑白颠倒  敌我不分
    中国人民解放军艺术学院  解平
    《兵临城下》是一部反现实、反历史的影片。
    一九四七年，毛主席在《目前形势和我们的任务》一文中，明确地向我们指出：“现在是一切国内外敌人都被他们的悲观情绪所统治的时候。他们唉声叹气，大叫危机，一点欢乐的影子也看不见了。”在我人民解放军排山倒海势如破竹的强大攻势面前，敌人虽在垂死挣扎，但已不可能挽回其灭亡的命运。
    《兵临城下》正是以这一历史阶段为背景的。但从影片里，我们看不到这种形势。相反，敌人在我大军压境之下，竟是那么泰然自若，坚定沉着，临危不乱，甚至还在豪华的大厅里，兴高采烈，手舞足蹈地饮酒祝寿，看不出我临城大军对他们的强大压力，更看不出敌人将要灭亡的趋势。影片的作者完全背离毛主席的指示，硬要让人们相信，敌人主要不是在我大军压境，已濒于消亡前夕的形势之下被迫起义投降的，而是通过什么内部派系之争，就会心甘情愿放下武器，归降人民。企图造成一种幻想：认为不用阶级斗争，敌人就会自行瓦解。这实在是一种颠倒黑白、不顾历史事实的歪曲。
    毛主席指示我们，对敌人，“革命文艺工作者的任务是在暴露他们的残暴和欺骗，并指出他们必然要失败的趋势”。《兵临城下》的作者，又完全背离毛主席的指示，对敌人大加美化，大加颂扬，把国民党的高级军官赵崇武、郑汉臣这些骑在人民头上的统治者，描绘得那么气宇轩昂，正义凛然；爱国爱民，忧国伤时，甚至在最危急的情况下，赵崇武们考虑的也不是个人的下场，而是“民族的元气”，“国家的前途”。这就等于说，只有赵崇武们才是最同情人民的疾苦，最关心人民的命运的。他才是人民的忠实代言人，而党所领导的伟大的解放战争，不过是毫无意义的不顾人民死活的“两党之争”。相反，影片的制作者们对我军姜部长这样负责的政治工作干部，却恣意丑化。把他描绘成一个不讲党的政策，不顾革命干部尊严，只凭三寸不烂之舌，纵横游说的政客。他在敌人面前是那么低声下气，称兄道弟，不敢对反动派理直气壮地进行斗争。这实在是对我军瓦解敌军的政治斗争恶意污蔑，对革命干部形象的极大歪曲。
    《兵临城下》歪曲了人民解放战争的历史真相，否定了阶级斗争的决定作用，是一部颠倒黑白、敌我不分的坏影片，我们必须对它进行严肃批判。
