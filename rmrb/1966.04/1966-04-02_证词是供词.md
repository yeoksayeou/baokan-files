    Testimony is a Confession
    Is U.S. imperialism really planning to improve relations with China, as Johnson and his ilk have recently clamored, or is it actively intensifying its "isolation" and "containment" of China, and preparing to compete with China? People can get a clear answer from the testimony of U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the U.S.'s new "military aid" plan.
    McNamara's testimony became a confession of the U.S.'s intensified hostility towards China. He emphasized that the focus of the new U.S. "military aid" plan is in the Far East, where the U.S. "will spend particularly heavily." It is clear that this arrangement by the Johnson administration is a component of its global strategic focus eastwards, aiming its main aggressive spearhead at China. McNamara made no secret of the fact that the U.S. government wants to strengthen its military encirclement of China through "military aid" to so-called "free nations" on the "periphery of mainland China." He particularly emphasized the importance of assisting the South Vietnamese puppet regime, Laos, Thailand, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and the South Korean puppet regime to maintain "considerable armies," which also shows that U.S. imperialism is trying its best to use its lackeys in Asia to wage a full-scale war of aggression in Asia.
    However, facts have long proven that the U.S.'s puppets in Asia are all useless figures who cannot be supported. Even though U.S. imperialism continues to pour large amounts of dollars and weapons into them, they are of little use; on the contrary, they can only become a burden to U.S. imperialism. Isn't the South Vietnamese puppet clique a typical example? In Greek mythology, the daughters of King Danaus of Argos were punished in hell to fill a bucket with holes with water. Isn't U.S. imperialism playing this pathetic role?

    证词是供词
    美帝国主义究竟是象约翰逊之流最近所喧嚷的那样打算同中国改善关系呢，还是积极加紧“孤立”和“遏制”中国，并且准备同中国较量一场呢？人们从美国国防部长麦克纳马拉在众议院外交委员会就美国新的“军事援助”计划作证时所发表的证词，也就可以得到明白的答案。
    麦克纳马拉的证词，成了美国加紧敌视中国的供词。他强调，美国新的“军事援助”计划的重点在远东，美国在这个地区“花的钱将特别多”。很显然，约翰逊政府的这种安排，是它把主要侵略矛头指向中国的全球战略重点东移计划的一个组成部分。麦克纳马拉毫不掩饰，美国政府要通过对“大陆中国边沿”的所谓“自由国家”的“军事援助”，来加强对中国的军事包围。他特别着重谈到援助南越傀儡政权、老挝、泰国、蒋介石匪帮和南朝鲜傀儡政权等以维持“数目相当大的军队”的重要性，这也表明美帝国主义竭力想要利用它在亚洲的走狗，在亚洲进行一场全面的侵略战争。
    但是，事实早已证明，美国在亚洲的傀儡都是一些扶不起来的阿斗。尽管美帝国主义继续在他们的身上投下大笔的美元和大批的武器，也是派不上多大用场的，相反的，他们只能成为美帝国主义的包袱。南越傀儡集团不就是一个典型的例子吗？希腊神话中的阿哥斯王达那尤斯的女儿们，在地狱中被处罚要把一个有洞的桶子倒满水。而美帝国主义所扮演的不正是这种可悲的角色吗？
