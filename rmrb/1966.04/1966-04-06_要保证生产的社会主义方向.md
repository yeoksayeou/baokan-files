    To Guarantee the Socialist Orientation of Production
    Zhang Wanfa, Secretary of the Party Branch of Sunjiawazi Brigade, Lishu Commune, Lishu County, Jilin Province

    How about the saying "Good production means good politics"? Let's start with my own experience.

    I have been working as the Party Branch Secretary of the production brigade for several years. To be honest, I don't mess around with my work; I put all my effort into production. I thought that if production is good, wouldn't politics be good too? With this kind of thinking, political work became optional. When production couldn't be increased, I thought of other tricks: using work points as an incentive. When people were unwilling to do dirty and tiring work, I gave more work points. I thought this method was pretty good. The soil in our brigade is good, and 1965 was a good year. Plus, we borrowed some external force—the higher-ups set up sample fields here. That year, the grain output increased by 22% compared to the previous year, which was the best harvest in our brigade's history. I thought that with more grain and good production, cadres and commune members wouldn't have any ideological problems. Who knew that while production went up, people's thinking went down instead.

    After the autumn harvest, when it came time for distribution, the dumplings burst open – the filling was exposed. Our increased grain production was the result of the state's assistance. Not to mention the credit of the higher-ups setting up sample fields, we still haven't repaid much of the loans we borrowed from the state. With the state's help, we should have sold more grain to the state after the bumper harvest. But then, we didn't think about the state, only about getting more for ourselves. Not only were we unwilling to sell more grain to the state, but we also didn't want to repay the loans we borrowed from the state. When the comrades from the credit union came to collect the loans, some accountants played "hide-and-seek" with them. Not only that, but we also wanted to rely on the state for this year's production. If we continued like this, wouldn't we be at odds with the state? What path were we heading down?

    Towards production, we only cared about the present, not considering the long term. During the distribution, we advocated for more distribution and less accumulation. Some teams even left insufficient production cost funds. Some production teams couldn't buy the chemical fertilizer allocated to us by the state this year; if we didn't buy it, we would be short of manure. At this time, I was in a difficult position. Brigades worse than us didn't ask the state for loans. If we asked again, it would be too embarrassing. If we continued like this, not to mention next year or the year after, even this year's production would obviously decline, wouldn't it?

    Some production team cadres, seeing that the value of work points had increased, thought that if they weren't cadres, with their skills, they would be among the best. They felt that being a cadre was a disadvantage and were unwilling to work. Wasn't this not wanting to make revolution anymore?

    At this time, I felt the seriousness of the problem, but I didn't know where the root cause was. With the help of the sample field work team, recently, our brigade organized cadres and commune members to carry out activities to learn from Jiao Yulu, and combined it with studying Chairman Mao's "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune". After discussing understanding, presenting problems, finding gaps, and repeated discussions: Why should we give prominence to politics? For whom do we serve as cadres? Does good production equal good politics? This time, I woke up. The root cause was the failure to give prominence to politics. Only focusing on production, thinking that "good production is good politics", will lead the people involved in production onto the wrong path, only caring about themselves, disregarding the state, and even at the expense of harming the interests of the state!

    After eight days of study and discussion, everyone's eyes became brighter the more they learned, and their hearts became broader. Their ideological awareness was greatly improved. Many comrades began to understand that simply producing more grain and having high distribution values ​​does not equal true good production. Following the capitalist direction and methods may temporarily produce more grain. But if we continue to do so, capitalist ideas will become more serious, which is more unfavorable to socialist construction and even destroys socialist construction. Only by adhering to the socialist direction, principles, and methods can we truly improve production. Such good production is beneficial to the socialist revolution and socialist construction. At present, there is still class struggle. Without highlighting proletarian politics, we cannot guarantee the socialist direction of production. After everyone's understanding improved, their thoughts changed, and their enthusiasm also came. The original five production teams that reached out to the state for loans have now mustered their energy, promoted the spirit of self-reliance, and retracted their hands. We here have never engaged in side occupations, but now we have opened a tofu workshop, spinning grass rope, weaving soil baskets, mats, coir mats, sauce hats, and making sorghum stalks curtains, etc., and have earned back more than two thousand yuan. When the Eighth Team was short of funds for buying chemical fertilizers and rice straw (for spinning grass rope), seven households of commune members lent more than one hundred yuan to the team. When the Fifth Team was short of raw materials for side occupations, the commune members lent the production team eight thousand catties of potatoes. Through these things, I realized that to do a good job in production, we must give prominence to politics, and to give prominence to politics, we must take Mao Zedong Thought as the guide and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

### 要保证生产的社会主义方向

    要保证生产的社会主义方向
    吉林省梨树县梨树公社孙家洼子大队党支部书记　张万发
    “生产好就是政治好”，这说法怎样，先不去说它，还是从我的事讲起吧。
    我做生产大队党支部工作，已经好几年了。说老实话，对干工作我是不含糊的，有劲都是往生产上使。我想，生产搞好了，政治不也就好了吗？有这种思想，政治工作就变成可有可无的了。生产搞不上去，就想别的招儿：用工分刺激，脏活累活有人不愿干，就多给工分。我还觉得这个方法不错。我们大队的土质好，一九六五年又赶上个好年头，再借点外力——上级在我们这里搞样板田，这一年的粮食产量比上一年提高百分之二十二，是我们大队历史上没有过的好收成。我想，粮食多打了，生产搞好了，干部和社员不会有什么思想问题了。那知道，生产上去了，人的思想反倒下来了。
    秋收打完场，一到分配的时候，破了皮的饺子——馅就露出来了。我们多打粮是国家帮助的结果，不用说上级办样板田的功劳，就是我们借国家的贷款现在还有许多没还给国家。国家这样帮助，照理说，我们丰收了，就应该多向国家交售些粮食。那曾想，到时候就不想国家，只顾自己多分了。不光不愿多向国家交售粮食，借国家的贷款也不想多还。信用社的同志来收贷款，有的会计跟他“藏猫”，不光这样，还想靠着国家搞今年的生产。象这样下去，不就和国家两条心了吗？这是走到什么道上来了？
    对国家这样，对生产也是只顾当前，不考虑长远。在分配的时候，就主张多分配，少积累，有的队甚至连生产费基金都留得不足。国家今年拨给我们的化肥，有的生产队就买不回来；不买吧，我们的粪肥还缺不少。这时我可就作难了，比我们差的大队都没向国家要贷款，我们再要伸手要，那可太说不下去了。这样干下去，不要说明年后年，就是今年的生产，不是明摆着得往下处溜吗？
    有的生产队干部，看见工分值提高了，心想，要不当干部，凭我这个把式，还不是数一数二的。就感到当干部吃亏，不愿做工作了。这不是不想革命了吗？
    这时候，我才感到了问题的严重性，但还不知道病根在那里。在样板田工作队的帮助下，最近，我们大队组织干部和社员开展学习焦裕禄的活动，并结合学习毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》。经过谈认识，摆问题，找差距，反复讨论了：为什么要突出政治？为谁当干部？生产好等不等于政治好？这回我才醒过来了。病根就在没有突出政治。光把眼珠子落到生产上，认为“生产好就是政治好”，就会把搞生产的人领到邪路上去，只顾自己，不顾国家，甚至不惜损害国家的利益！
    经过八天的学习和讨论，大家越学眼睛越亮，越学心里越宽敞，思想觉悟有了很大的提高。不少同志开始懂得，光是打粮多，分值高，不等于是真正的生产好。照资本主义的方向、方法，一时也可能多打粮。但是照这样套套搞下去，资本主义思想就越严重，就越不利于社会主义建设，甚至破坏社会主义建设。只有坚持社会主义的方向、原则、方法，才能真正搞好生产，这样的生产好才对社会主义革命和社会主义建设有好处。当前，还有阶级斗争，不突出无产阶级政治，就不能保证生产的社会主义方向。大家提高认识以后，思想变了，劲头也就来了。原来伸手向国家要贷款的五个生产队，现在都鼓足了干劲，发扬自力更生精神，把手缩回来了。我们这里，从来不搞副业，现在也开豆腐坊，纺草绳，编土篮、席子、茓子、酱帽子、打秫秸帘子等，已挣回二千来元。第八队买化肥和稻草（纺草绳）缺款，七户社员就把一百多元借给队里。第五队搞副业缺原料，社员便借给生产队土豆八千斤。通过这些事情，使我认识到，搞好生产必须突出政治，要想突出政治，必须以毛泽东思想挂帅，按毛主席的指示办事。
