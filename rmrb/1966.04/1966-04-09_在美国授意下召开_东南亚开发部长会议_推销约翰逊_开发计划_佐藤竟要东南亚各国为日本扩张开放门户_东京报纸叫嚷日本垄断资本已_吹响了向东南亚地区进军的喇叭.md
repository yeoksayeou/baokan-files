    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th Dispatch: The "Southeast Asian Development Ministers Conference," convened by the Japanese Sato government on the 6th under US instigation, ended hastily on the evening of the 7th after passing a joint communique.
    In addition to Japan, the formal representatives attending this conference included the Philippines, the South Vietnamese puppet regime, the Vientiane authorities of Laos, Thailand, "Malaysia," and Singapore. The Indonesian government, controlled by a right-wing general group, dispatched its newly appointed ambassador to Japan as an "observer" to attend the conference. The chargé d'affaires of the Cambodian embassy in Japan also participated in the conference as an observer.
    After listening to the opening speech by Japanese Prime Minister Sato, the conference entered into closed-door meetings. In his opening speech, Sato emphasized that in order to "develop Southeast Asia," Japan is prepared to substantially expand its "aid" to the region in the near future. According to reports, the conference discussed "agricultural, forestry, and fishery issues"; "transportation and communication issues"; "economic and technical cooperation provided by industrially advanced countries and international organizations"; and "other important issues related to accelerating regional development cooperation," among other topics.
    Based on the initiative of the Japanese government, the conference decided to establish a "Center for Promoting Economic Development in Southeast Asia" to study specific plans for the future and decided to hold the second "Southeast Asian Development Ministers Conference" in Manila next year.
    The outcome of this conference shows that it was a meeting in which the Sato government, acting as a front, peddled the US's "ten billion dollar development plan for Southeast Asia," and at the same time, it was a meeting to pave the way for Japanese monopoly capital to expand into the Southeast Asian region.
    The communique drafting committee, chaired by Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Tomisaburo Hashimoto, peddled many American goods in the communique adopted by the conference. This communique not only openly promoted the role of the "Asian Development Bank" advocated by the Johnson government but also proposed that Southeast Asian countries should accept capital and "aid" from "advanced countries" and "international organizations" outside of Asia. Kyodo News Agency's commentary pointed out that this includes Johnson's so-called idea of "developing Southeast Asia."
    Japanese Prime Minister Sato said in his speech at the conference that the doors of this conference should be "open to Southeast Asian countries." Regarding the meaning of these words, Tomisaburo Hashimoto said at a press conference that Sato's "open door" policy was not only aimed at Burma, but also that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam would be invited to the "Southeast Asian Development Ministers Conference" in the future, depending on "changes in the international situation." This clearly shows that this conference convened by the Japanese government is blood-related to the "ten billion dollar development plan for Southeast Asia" that Johnson fantasized about last April in order to lure the Vietnamese people into laying down their weapons.
    During the conference, Japanese government ministers concerned raised a series of plans and suggestions on the issue of "Southeast Asian development," ranging from agriculture and fisheries to light industry, from port construction to road construction, from power construction to international communication facilities, and from economic technology to medical care and education, and they particularly emphasized "developing" agriculture. This shows that under the guise of "aiding Southeast Asian development," the Japanese government is first plundering the agricultural resources of this region, attempting to turn Southeast Asia into its source of food and raw materials and a market for industrial products.
    In order to collude with US imperialism to suppress the national liberation movement and plunder the rich resources of Southeast Asia, the Japanese government is prepared to provide "aid" to the Southeast Asian countries and puppet regimes participating in the conference in the form of building or expanding roads and ports in the Southeast Asian region. Japanese Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Yuichi Kori also proposed a politically, economically, and militarily significant suggestion to lay a submarine cable in Southeast Asia at the conference. Kyodo News Agency said that if this plan can be realized, "it can complete the trans-Pacific cable connecting the United States and Southeast Asian countries, and the United States has actively expressed its willingness to share (construction) funds."
    The ambition exposed by Japanese monopoly capital at this conference could not be concealed even by the bourgeois newspapers. The *Mainichi Shimbun* pointed out on the 8th that the "Southeast Asian Development Ministers Conference" "has its purpose more in establishing a Japanese diplomatic system in Southeast Asia than in its original economic significance." The newspaper also said that "Japanese diplomacy has moved out of its 'hibernation period' and entered a period of fetal movement in seeking a way out in the Southeast Asian region," and that "the Japanese government has sounded the horn for advancing into the Southeast Asian region."
    Kyodo News Agency commented: "What is noteworthy is that Japan has stepped in where the United States cannot reach."
    The *Mainichi Shimbun* also revealed on the 8th that Prime Minister Sato is preparing to go to Southeast Asia in early October with a "long-term blueprint for economic aid to Southeast Asia" on the basis of this conference.

    在美国授意下召开“东南亚开发部长会议”推销约翰逊“开发计划”
    佐藤竟要东南亚各国为日本扩张开放门户
    东京报纸叫嚷日本垄断资本已“吹响了向东南亚地区进军的喇叭”
    新华社东京八日电　日本佐藤政府六日在美国授意下召开的“东南亚开发部长会议”于七日晚间通过了一项联合公报后，草草收场。
    出席这次会议的正式代表除日本以外，有菲律宾、南越傀儡集团、老挝万象当局、泰国、“马来西亚”和新加坡。由右派将领集团控制的印度尼西亚政府派遣了它的新任驻日大使作为“观察员”出席了会议。以观察员身份参加这次会议的还有柬埔寨驻日大使馆代办。
    会议听取了日本首相佐藤的开幕词后，进入了秘密会议。佐藤在开幕词中强调，为了“开发东南亚”，日本准备在最近大幅度地扩大对这个地区的“援助”。据报道，会议讨论了“农业、林业和渔业问题”；“运输和交通问题”；“工业先进国家和国际组织给予的经济和技术合作问题”；“加速地区发展合作的其他重要问题”等。
    会议根据日本政府的倡议，决定成立“促进东南亚经济发展中心”，以研究今后的具体计划，并且决定明年在马尼拉举行“东南亚开发部长会议”第二次会议。
    这次会议结果表明，这是一次由佐藤政府出面兜售美国的“用十亿美元开发东南亚计划”的会议，同时也是为日本垄断资本向东南亚地区进行扩张开辟道路的会议。
    由日本内阁官房长官桥本登美三郎担任委员长的会议公报起草委员会，在会议通过的公报中贩卖了很多美国货色。这个公报不仅公然鼓吹约翰逊政府倡议设立的“亚洲开发银行”的作用，而且提出东南亚国家应当接受亚洲以外的“先进国家”、“国际组织”的资本和“援助”。共同社的评论指出，这就包括了约翰逊所谓“开发东南亚”的想法。
    日本首相佐藤在会议致词里说，要使这次会议的门户，“向东南亚各国敞开”。对于这番话的含义，桥本登美三郎在记者招待会上说，佐藤所说的“门户敞开”，不仅是针对缅甸说的，今后还准备随着“国际局势的变化”，把越南民主共和国作为“东南亚开发部长会议”的邀请对象，这明确地说明了日本政府出面召开的这次会议，同去年四月约翰逊妄想为诱骗越南人民放下武器而提出的“十亿美元开发东南亚计划”的血缘关系。
    在会议期间，日本政府有关大臣就“东南亚开发”问题提出了从农业、水产业到轻工业，从港湾建设到道路建设，从电力建设到国际通讯设施，从经济技术到医疗、教育等一系列的计划和建议，并且特别强调“发展”农业。这表明，日本政府在“援助东南亚开发”的幌子下，首先掠夺这个地区的农业资源，企图把东南亚地区变成它的粮食和原料供应地和工业品市场。
    为了伙同美帝国主义镇压民族解放运动和掠夺东南亚地区丰富资源，日本政府准备向参加会议的东南亚国家和傀儡集团以提供“援助”的形式，新建或扩建东南亚地区的道路和港口。日本邮政大臣郡祐一还向会议提出了一项具有政治、经济和军事意义的铺设东南亚海底电缆的建议。共同社说，这项方案如能实现，“就可以完成连接美国和东南亚各国的横断太平洋的电缆，美国积极表示愿意分担（建设）资金。”
    日本垄断资本在这次会议上暴露出来的野心，连资产阶级报刊也无法掩饰。《每日新闻》八日指出“东南亚开发部长会议”“所蕴藏的目的与其说在于它本来的经济意义，不如说是要建立日本对东南亚地区外交的体制。”这家报纸还说，“日本的外交在向东南亚地区谋求出路方面，已经脱离了‘冬眠期’，而进入了胎动时期”，“日本政府吹响了向东南亚地区进军的喇叭”。
    共同社评论说：“令人注目的是美国的手伸不到的地方，日本伸进去了”。
    《每日新闻》在八日还透露，佐藤首相将在这次会议的基础上，准备在今年十月初带着“对东南亚经济援助的长期蓝图”，到东南亚进行活动。
