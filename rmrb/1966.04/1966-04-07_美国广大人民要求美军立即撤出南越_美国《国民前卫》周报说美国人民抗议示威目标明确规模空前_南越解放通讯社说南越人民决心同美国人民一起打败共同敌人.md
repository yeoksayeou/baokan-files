    The American Newspaper *National Guardian* Says the Goal of American People's Protests and Demonstrations is Clear and the Scale is Unprecedented
    South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency Says the South Vietnamese People are Determined to Defeat the Common Enemy Together with the American People
    Xinhua News Agency, New York: The *National Guardian* published an article on the 2nd, pointing out the great significance of the nationwide large-scale demonstrations by the American people on March 25-26 protesting Johnson's war of aggression against Vietnam.
    The article said, "In the United States, this protest surpassed the protest initiated by the National Coordinating Committee to End the War in Vietnam last October. This shows that the anti-war movement has made significant progress in responding to the Johnson administration's escalation of intervention in Vietnam."
    The article quoted a spokesperson for the coordinating committee as saying: "This international protest day is a major achievement of the anti-war movement." The spokesperson said: "Since (last) October, a large number of people have changed from expressing doubts about the war to actively opposing the war." "Despite (the authorities') use of news blockades and other obstructive measures, the demonstrations exceeded all our expectations." "In the United States, the great achievement of March 25-26 is that we are clearly connecting with the masses. We are reaching new people. In the messages we received from various national groups participating in this action, there is almost a common theme: 'New people, larger demonstrations.'"
    The article said that the National Coordinating Committee estimated that 125 regions participated in this protest action. The scale of protest actions in almost every place was larger than before.
    The article pointed out that not only was the number of people participating in the demonstrations greater than before, but the goals of the struggle were also clearer than before. The article said, "The slogan 'Bring the troops back immediately' was once a very controversial slogan, but now in most protest actions, this slogan has been accepted as a legitimate demand."
    The *National Guardian* also published an editorial on the same day, saying that the March 26 movement will inevitably lead the American people to consider more deeply the policies pursued by the Johnson government and their relationship to these policies. "Similarly, the lessons for the protesters are also obvious: that is, demonstrations are effective and are a necessary and important component in the struggle against the war machine. However, demonstrations will only be truly effective when they lead to an organized and powerful movement dedicated to fundamental political and social reforms of the social structure."
    The editorial also said, "In many other countries, and in South Vietnam itself, demonstrations mainly about American policy were also held simultaneously." The anti-American slogans raised by the demonstrators in South Vietnam "directly expose Washington's propaganda that American troops are staying in South Vietnam and American planes are bombing North Vietnam to protect the right to self-determination. The fact is that the people of Vietnam—North and South—want American troops to withdraw, and they want American troops to withdraw now. The consistency of the demands of American and Vietnamese demonstrators is natural and a political inevitability."
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi: The South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency recently published a commentary on the American people's campaign to protest the Johnson government's war of aggression against Vietnam, pointing out that the South Vietnamese people are determined to fight together with the American people to defeat the common enemy of the Vietnamese and American people, U.S. imperialism.
    The commentary said that in the recent "International Protest Day" activities protesting the Johnson government's war of aggression against Vietnam, hundreds of thousands of people in more than 100 cities in the United States took to the streets to hold demonstrations, which shows the great indignation of the American people towards the Johnson clique's war policy.
    The commentary also mentioned that the "International Protest Day" movement against the Johnson government's war of aggression against Vietnam has not only become a huge storm in North America, the lair of the American aggressors, but has also swept across all continents.
    The commentary stated that the South Vietnamese people, with the determination to defeat the common enemy of the Vietnamese and American nations—the U.S. imperialist aggressors—are fighting together with the American people to realize the just aspirations of the two nations.

    美国广大人民要求美军立即撤出南越
    美国《国民前卫》周报说美国人民抗议示威目标明确规模空前
    南越解放通讯社说南越人民决心同美国人民一起打败共同敌人
    据新华社讯　纽约消息：《国民前卫》周报二日发表一篇文章，指出美国人民三月二十五日——二十六日抗议约翰逊侵越战争的全国规模大示威的重大意义。
    文章说，“在美国，这次抗议行动超过了结束越南战争全国协调委员会去年十月发起的抗议行动，这表明，反战运动有了重大的发展，以回答约翰逊政府干涉越南的逐步升级的做法。”
    文章说，这个协调委员会的一位发言人说：“这个国际抗议日是反战运动的重大成就。”这位发言人说：“自从（去年）十月以来，大批人已经从对战争表示怀疑变为积极反对战争。”“尽管（当局）采取了新闻封锁和其他刁难的办法，但是示威游行超过了我们所期待的一切。”“在美国，三月二十五日——二十六日的巨大成就是，我们正在明显地同群众接触。我们正在接触到新的人民。在我们收到的来自参加这次行动的全国各团体的消息中几乎都有这样一个共同的主题：‘新的人民，更大的示威游行’。”
    文章说，全国协调委员会估计有一百二十五个地区参加了这次抗议行动。几乎每一个地方的抗议行动的规模都比以前大。
    文章指出，不但参加示威的人数比以前多了，而且斗争目标也比以前更明确。文章说，“立即把军队撤回来”这句口号曾经一度是非常有争论的口号，但是现在在大多数抗议行动中，这句口号已作为正当的主张被接受下来了。
    《国民前卫》周报同一天还发表一篇社论说，三月二十六日运动必然使美国人民对约翰逊政府推行的政策以及这个政策同他们的关系进行更深刻的考虑。“同样，对抗议者来说经验教训也是明显的：即示威游行是收到效果的，是反对战争机器斗争中的必要的重要组成部分。但是，只有在这种示威游行导向一个有组织的、强有力的运动，这个运动致力于社会结构的根本的政治和社会改革的时候，示威游行才会真正有效。”
    社论还说，“在其他许多国家，在南越本地，也同时举行主要是关于美国政策的示威”。南越示威群众提出的反美口号“直接揭穿了华盛顿的宣传，即说什么美国军队呆在南越和美国飞机轰炸北越是为了保护自决权。事实是，越南——北方和南方——人民要美国军队撤走，他们要美国军队现在就撤走。美国和越南示威者的要求的一致是理所当然的，这是政治上的必然性。”
    新华社河内电　越南南方解放通讯社最近就美国人民开展抗议约翰逊政府侵略越南战争的运动发表评论指出，越南南方人民决心同美国人民一起，为打败越南人民和美国人民的共同敌人美帝国主义而斗争。
    评论说，在最近开展的抗议约翰逊政府侵越战争的“国际抗议日”活动中，美国一百多个城市的成千上万人民，纷纷涌上街头，举行示威游行，这说明了美国人民对约翰逊集团的战争政策的极大愤慨。
    评论还谈到反对约翰逊政府侵越战争的“国际抗议日”运动，不仅在美国侵略者的巢穴北美洲变成巨大的风暴，而且还席卷了所有各个大洲。
    评论表示，越南南方人民怀着打败越、美两个民族的共同敌人——美帝国主义侵略者的决心，同美国人民一起为实现两个民族的正当愿望而斗争。
