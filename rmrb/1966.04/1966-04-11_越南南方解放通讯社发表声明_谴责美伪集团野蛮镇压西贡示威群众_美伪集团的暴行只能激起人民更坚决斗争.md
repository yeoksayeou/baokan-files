    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 10th (electric dispatch) - The South Vietnam Liberation News Agency issued a statement on April 8th, strongly condemning the atrocities of the US aggressors and the Nguyen Cao Ky puppet clique in savagely suppressing the demonstrations and marches of Saigon students and other citizens against the US-puppet clique on April 8th.

    The statement said that news from Saigon indicated that the armed military police of the US-puppet clique opened fire on demonstrators that day, even using tear gas and irritant poisonous gas bombs. US military police also openly participated in the suppression.

    The statement said: The Liberation News Agency, the official news agency of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, is authorized to strongly condemn this brutal behavior of the US aggressors and the Nguyen Cao Ky - Nguyen Van Thieu lackey clique.

    The statement said that these suppressive actions by the US-puppet clique can only further arouse the anger of the South Vietnamese people and make them more determined to struggle.

    The South Vietnam Liberation Radio also issued a commentary on April 8th, pointing out that the powerful movement of the people in the enemy-occupied areas of South Vietnam against the US-puppet clique shows that the people in the cities in the enemy-occupied areas have been oppressed and exploited for more than ten years under the cruel rule of the US aggressors and their running dogs, and can no longer endure it.

    The commentary called on the people in the enemy-occupied areas to unite and further bravely launch a struggle against the US aggressors and their running dogs, while maintaining high vigilance to prevent the US aggressors and their running dogs from adopting deceptive means and using the patriotic enthusiasm and fighting spirit of the demonstrators to serve their despicable conspiracies.

    新华社河内十日电　越南南方解放通讯社八日发表声明，强烈谴责美国侵略者和阮高其傀儡集团八日野蛮镇压西贡学生和其他市民反对美伪集团示威游行的暴行。
    声明说，来自西贡的消息说，美伪集团的武装军警这一天向示威者开火，甚至使用催泪弹和刺激性毒气弹。美国宪兵也公然参加了镇压行动。
    声明说：越南南方民族解放阵线官方通讯社——解放通讯社受权强烈谴责美国侵略者和阮高其—阮文绍走狗集团的这种残暴行为。
    声明说，美伪集团这些镇压行动只能进一步激起南越人民的愤怒和使他们更加坚决地进行斗争。
    越南南方解放电台八日也发表评论指出，南越敌占区人民的声势浩大的反对美伪集团的运动表明，敌占区城市人民在美国侵略者及其走狗的残酷统治下，已经被压迫和剥削了十多年，再也不能忍受下去了。
    评论号召敌占区城市人民团结起来，进一步英勇地展开反对美国侵略者及其走狗的斗争，同时，高度保持警惕，防止美国侵略者及其走狗采取欺骗手段，利用示威群众的爱国热情和斗争精神为他们卑鄙的阴谋服务。
