    The Diesel Engine is Singing
    Guan Jimin, Lathe Operator at Nanning Machinery Factory
    We are mechanical workers,
    We love to hear the singing of diesel engines the most.
    Thump, thump, thump! How beautiful that sound is!
    Thump, thump, thump! How loud it sings!
    Listen! Fifty 195N diesel engines are playing the socialist movement!
    In order to support the agricultural front,
    Our workers must contribute their strength.
    Over the past few years, we have shed our sweat,
    From trial production to installation,
    How many technical barriers have we overcome?
    How many stumbling blocks have we left behind!
    Difficulties cannot frighten heroes,
    Chairman Mao's works point us in the right direction.
    The 195N was finally successfully trial-produced,
    And is about to go to the agricultural front,
    Thump, thump, thump! Thump, thump, thump!
    How happily and powerfully you sing!
    May you make great contributions on the agricultural front,
    And sing triumphant songs for the new Five-Year Plan!

    柴油机在歌唱
    南宁机械厂车工　官济民
    我们是机械工人，
    最爱听柴油机的歌唱，
    突，突，突！那声音多么优美，
    突，突，突！它唱得多么宏亮。
    听！五十台195N柴油机，演奏着社会主义的乐章！
    为了支援农业战线，
    咱们工人要贡献力量，
    几年来我们挥洒汗水，
    从试制到安装，
    多少技术关被我们闯过，
    多少拦路虎被我们甩在一旁。
    困难吓不倒英雄汉，
    毛主席著作给我们指明方向。
    195N终于试制成功，
    就要奔赴农业战线上，
    突突突！突突突！
    你唱得多欢多有力量！
    愿你在农业战线立大功，
    为新的五年计划把凯歌高唱！
