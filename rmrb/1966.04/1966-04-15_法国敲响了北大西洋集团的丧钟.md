	The internal fragmentation of the Western imperialist camp is developing in depth. The de Gaulle government recently decided to no longer allow French territory and airspace to be used by the U.S. military and the U.S.-controlled North Atlantic Group. At the same time, French military personnel and French troops stationed in West Germany will also withdraw from the group's military system starting on July 1. De Gaulle further proposed a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops. In this way, de Gaulle pushed the already shaky North Atlantic Group into a serious crisis bordering on disintegration.
	Washington responded to France's "sabotage" with vicious curses and urgently convened a 14-nation meeting of the North Atlantic Group in an attempt to isolate France. U.S. Undersecretary of State Ball ranted and raved at the meeting that "betrayal should not be rewarded" and "an uncooperative member of an alliance should not benefit," with the same "prestige" as the medieval Inquisition.
	However, no matter how furious Washington was, the 14-nation meeting of the North Atlantic Group did not completely follow the U.S. baton and become a big stick for the U.S. to sanction France, but was slow to reach any agreement. The *New York Times* had already foreseen this situation uneasily at the end of March. It said that this debate of "anti-de Gaulleism" "will take a very long time" and will still "not reach an agreement" in the end. This is exactly the case. To date, the 14 countries have held eight meetings and have still achieved nothing.
	Not only that, but during the meeting, Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar even told a *New York Times* reporter that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is "largely outdated." At the same time, news from Washington and Turkey said that Turkey is also demanding to revise the Turkish-U.S. base agreement and the agreement on the status of troops signed by Turkey with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
	The United States not only cannot use the North Atlantic Group to sanction France, but on the contrary, France's withdrawal from the military "integration" mechanism of the North Atlantic Group has been echoed by some countries. This is a very cynical satire and blow to the hegemonic status of the United States. Of course, this is because the strength of Western European countries has been restored and strengthened after the war, and they have long been unwilling to continue placing their territories, bases, and ports under the control of the U.S. command system. They are all striving to get rid of U.S. control and restore their sovereignty and independence to varying degrees. France's lead is merely playing the role of a bellwether.
	The publicizing of U.S.-French contradictions has a long history. The current sharp deterioration is not sudden for the United States. In fact, the Johnson administration was also prepared to deal with this situation. This is that the United States has been planning to make the North Atlantic Alliance able to exist without France. Johnson's special adviser, former Secretary of State Acheson, once again threatened on April 4 that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization could do without France. Undersecretary of State Ball also clamored that "we can certainly do without France."
	The basis for the United States to make this plan is that it can rely more on West Germany in Western Europe, which is very obvious. The *Aujourd'hui Paris* pointed out on March 31 that "the United States intends to give West Germany the position of France." However, this calculation is too wishful thinking.
	With the support of the United States, West Germany's industrial production potential has reached a position second only to the United States in the Western world, and its twelve army divisions equipped with U.S. weapons overwhelm all Western European countries in terms of both quantity and quality. Britain and all the small countries of the North Atlantic Group have long felt uneasy about the resurgence of this country that has twice launched wars and wreaked havoc on Europe. Now, after France announced its withdrawal, the United States is raising the status of West Germany within the North Atlantic Group, disrupting the balance of power in Western Europe. This is of course more likely to cause panic in Western European countries.
	The West German *Bayerische Staatszeitung* pointed out on April 9 that "Britain is less worried about the French withdrawal from the organization than about the possible increase in Germany's (West Germany) position." The *New York Times* also said that the increase in West Germany's status will "stimulate the latent anti-German sentiment of their residents" in the small countries of Western Europe.
	Indeed, if the United States disregards Western European public opinion and insists on supporting West Germany, it will accelerate the collapse of the North Atlantic Group. Even Washington officials are worried about this. U.S. Undersecretary of State Ball twice denied on March 15 and 31 that the United States had a plan to strengthen West Germany's position in the North Atlantic Group, precisely to eliminate the fear and uneasiness of Britain and the Scandinavian countries about West Germany's further strength.
	Not only that, but West Germany, which the United States wants to step up its support for, is in fact also beginning to demand that the United States further satisfy its various ambitious plans and seek its own resurgence. The *New York Times* revealed that West Germany is prepared to demand that the United States make "rapid and effective guarantees" for West Germany's "defense." If such "guarantees" are not obtained, West Germany "will certainly clamor for at least partial ownership of nuclear weapons. If nuclear weapons are not available due to the opposition of other allies or Washington," "then the Germans (West Germans) will certainly react by acquiring nuclear weapons themselves."
	It is precisely because of worrying about this situation of disintegration that the Johnson administration, on the one hand, threatens and coerces France, and on the other hand, still has to make a "reconciliation" gesture on the surface, hoping that France will not act decisively, saying that "the road to reform is consultation rather than isolation," "as long as France decides to assume its leadership role, France, as our old friend and ally, will have its place," and so on. At the same time, it also claims that the dispute between the United States and France involves all countries in the entire North Atlantic Group, and claims that this issue "is not appropriate for Paris and Washington to discuss alone, but must be discussed by the 15-nation alliance as a whole." Obviously, this is all to buy time and stay in France.
	However, the French President announced at the cabinet meeting on April 13 that he would not make any concessions regarding the date stipulated for the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops. This made Johnson's calculation fall through again and suffered another head-on blow.
	*U.S. News & World Report* magazine had to lament: "The prospects for Europe will have a natural dangerous tendency for a period of time (probably a long period of time)." "Europeans who are no longer interested in forming an Atlantic community with the United States are increasingly going their own way."
	This series of actions by France tolled the death knell for the North Atlantic Group. This tool used by the United States to control Western Europe can no longer be maintained.

### 法国敲响了北大西洋集团的丧钟

    法国敲响了北大西洋集团的丧钟
    西方帝国主义阵营内部四分五裂的局面，正在深入发展。戴高乐政府最近决定不再让法国的领土、领空为美军和美国控制的北大西洋集团所利用，同时，法国军事人员和法国驻西德的军队七月一日起也要从这个集团的军事体系中撤走。戴高乐还进一步提出要美国驻军滚蛋的时间表。这样，戴高乐就把已经摇摇晃晃的北大西洋集团，推到濒于瓦解的严重危机中。
    对于法国的“拆台”行动，华盛顿报以恶毒的咒骂，并紧急召开了北大西洋集团十四国会议，企图孤立法国。美国副国务卿鲍尔在会上大叫大嚷什么“不应该让背叛得到奖赏”，“不应该让一个联盟的不合作的成员得到好处”。大有象中世纪宗教裁判所的那种“威风”。
    但是，不论华盛顿怎样暴跳如雷，北大西洋集团十四国会议并没有完全按照美国的指挥棒，成为美国制裁法国的大棒，而是迟迟不能达成任何协议。《纽约时报》早在三月底就曾惶惶不安地预见到这一局面。它说这场“反戴高乐主义”的辩论，“将进行一个很长的时间”，而且最后仍然“不会取得协议”。事实正是这样。迄至目前为止，十四国已举行了八次会议，仍然没有取得什么结果。
    不但如此，就在会议进行中，葡萄牙总理萨拉查竟向《纽约时报》记者发表谈话说：北大西洋公约组织“在很大程度上是过时了”。同时，从华盛顿和土耳其传出消息说：土耳其也在要求修改土美基地协定以及土耳其同北大西洋公约组织签订的军队地位协定。
    美国不仅无法利用北大西洋集团制裁法国，而且相反地法国退出北大西洋集团军事“一体化”机构的行动，倒得到一些国家的附和。这对于美国的霸主地位是一种十分辛辣的讽刺和打击。当然，这是因为战后西欧各国的力量已经得到恢复和加强，它们早已不愿把自己的领土、基地和港口继续置于美国的指挥体系的控制之下。它们都在不同程度上力求摆脱美国控制，恢复自己的主权和独立。法国的率先发难，不过是起一种带头羊的作用罢了。
    美法矛盾的公开化，由来已久。目前的急剧恶化，对于美国来说，并不突然。事实上，约翰逊政府为了应付这一局面也是早有准备的。这就是美国一直在策划要使北大西洋联盟在没有法国的情况下，也能存在下去。约翰逊的特别顾问、前国务卿艾奇逊在四月四日就再次扬言，北大西洋公约组织可以不要法国。副国务卿鲍尔也叫嚷“我们肯定能够没有法国也行”。
    美国作此打算的根据是，它可以在西欧大陆上更多倚重西德，这是很明显的。《今日巴黎报》三月三十一日就指出：“美国打算把法国的位置给西德”。但是，这个算盘未免打得太如意了。
    在美国的扶植下，西德的工业生产潜力在西方世界已达到仅次于美国的地位，它用美国武器装备起来的十二个陆军师，无论从数量和质量上都压倒西欧所有国家。英国和北大西洋集团所有小国对于这个曾经两次发动战争、横行欧洲的国家的东山再起，早已深感不安。现在，法国宣告退出以后，美国抬高西德在北大西洋集团内的身价，打乱西欧的力量的平衡。这当然更要引起西欧各国的惊慌。
    西德《巴伐利亚信使报》四月九日就指出：“英国与其说担心法国人退出这个组织，不如说担心德国（西德）地位有可能提高”。《纽约时报》也说，西德地位的提高将在西欧各小国中“激发它们居民的潜在反德情绪”。
    的确，美国如果不顾西欧舆论，执意扶植西德，势将加速北大西洋集团的崩溃。连华盛顿的官员也担心这一点。美国副国务卿鲍尔于上月十五日和三十一日两次否认美国有在北大西洋集团内加强西德地位的计划，正是为了消除英国和斯堪的那维亚国家对西德进一步强大的恐惧和不安。
    不仅如此，美国要加紧扶植的西德，事实上也在开始要求美国进一步满足它的各种野心勃勃的计划，谋求自己的东山再起。《纽约时报》透露，西德已准备要求美国对西德的“国防”作出“迅速的有效保证”。如果得不到这类“保证”，西德“肯定将吵嚷着要至少取得对核武器的部分所有权。如果由于其他盟国或华盛顿的反对，核武器拿不到手”，“那么德国（西德）人肯定将作出自己取得核武器的反应”。
    正是担心这种分崩离析的局面难以收拾，约翰逊政府才一方面对法国进行威胁要挟，另一方面仍然不得不在表面上作出“和解”的姿态，希望法国不要断然行动，说什么“改革的道路是磋商而不是孤立”啦，“只要法国决定担负它的领导作用，作为我们的老朋友和盟友的法国都将有它的位置”啦，等等。同时，它还借口美法之间争执牵涉到整个北大西洋集团各国，而声称这个问题“光由巴黎和华盛顿来讨论是不适当的，而必须由十五国联盟作为一个整体来谈”。显然，这都是为了拖延时间，赖在法国不走。
    但是，法国总统四月十三日在内阁会议上宣布，他对于规定的美军完全撤走的日期，将毫不让步。这就使约翰逊的算盘又一次落空，遭到又一当头棒喝。
    《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志不得不悲叹道：“欧洲的前景在一段时期内（大概是一段长时期）将出现自然而然的危险倾向。”“对同美国结成大西洋共同体不再感兴趣的欧洲人正在越来越走他们自己的道路。”
    法国的这一系列行动，敲响了北大西洋集团的丧钟。美国用以控制西欧的这个工具，再也难以维持下去了。          ·振亚·
