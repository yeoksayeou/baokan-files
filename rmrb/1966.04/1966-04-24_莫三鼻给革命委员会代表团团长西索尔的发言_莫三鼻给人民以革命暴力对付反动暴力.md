    Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd -- Valentim Xisole, head of the Mozambique Revolutionary Committee Delegation, told delegates from various countries attending the Fourth Plenary Meeting (Enlarged) of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association on the 22nd that the people of Mozambique, who have waged a long struggle against colonialism, now understand that the only way to liberate Mozambique is to take up arms and use revolutionary violence to counter reactionary violence.
    In his speech, Xisole also said that in order to restore peace in the world, it is necessary to overthrow U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. We cannot coexist with imperialism—they must be overthrown. There can be no cooperation or compromise with imperialism.
    He said that the heroic Vietnamese people have proven Chairman Mao’s theory: U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger. The people of Mozambique, under the leadership of the Mozambique Revolutionary Committee, fully support the just struggle of our Vietnamese brothers against U.S. aggression. He said that U.S. imperialism has committed heinous crimes in Vietnam. We demand that the American robbers completely and unconditionally withdraw from Vietnamese territory and let the Vietnamese people solve their own problems.
    Speaking of the struggle of the people of Mozambique, he said that the purpose of the Mozambique Revolutionary Committee is to completely liberate Mozambique. The people of Mozambique, like all other nations, hope to be free from colonial rule. To achieve this goal, the people of Mozambique are prepared to make the greatest sacrifices. He said that shortly after the establishment of the Mozambique Revolutionary Committee, the Action Committee of the Mozambique Revolutionary Committee decided to wage an armed struggle against the Portuguese colonialists in Mozambique. In the past five months, our guerrillas have achieved significant victories in the areas where they are stationed.
    Valentim Xisole said that the Mozambique Revolutionary Committee believes that the current international revolutionary situation is extremely favorable to the oppressed people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. This situation has been created because the progressive revolutionary anti-imperialist forces in the storm centers have adopted an uncompromising stance. However, U.S. imperialism has not yet been defeated. It must be defeated by the joint efforts of the peace-loving people of the world. He said that the coup in Ghana was planned and executed by U.S. and British imperialists. If Africa is to achieve freedom, the rebellion in Ghana must be crushed.
    He said that we strongly condemn the Indonesian right-wing forces for their crude interference in the affairs of the Asian-African Journalists Association, and we also condemn the barbaric suppression, massacre, and imprisonment of Indonesian progressive forces, including journalists. We formally express our full support for the Indonesian people who are opposing the right-wing fascist military dictatorship.
    He said that we fully support the struggle of our Arab brothers to recover their occupied Palestinian homeland, and we condemn the U.S. neo-colonialist plan to turn Israel into a U.S. base of aggression. We formally announce our full solidarity and support for our Congolese brothers, Zimbabwean brothers, and other brothers who stand at the forefront of the anti-imperialist struggle. The Mozambique Revolutionary Committee fully supports the struggles of all of you, because your struggles are also our struggles.
    He said that we unequivocally support the General Secretary's General Report and the report on temporary withdrawal of the Asian-African Journalists Association, and formally announce our full support for all actions taken by the Asian-African Journalists Association to maintain and protect the 1963 Jakarta Declaration.

    莫三鼻给革命委员会代表团团长西索尔的发言
    莫三鼻给人民以革命暴力对付反动暴力
    新华社二十三日讯　莫三鼻给革命委员会代表团团长瓦朗蒂姆·西索尔，二十二日向出席亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议（扩大）的各国代表说，同殖民主义者进行了长期斗争的莫三鼻给人民现在已经了解到，解放莫三鼻给的唯一道路是拿起武器，以革命的暴力对付反动的暴力。
    西索尔在发言中还说，为了使世界上重新出现和平，必须打倒美帝国主义及其仆从。我们不能同帝国主义共处——必须打倒他们。同帝国主义不能合作，不能妥协。
    他说，英雄的越南人民已经证明了毛主席的理论：美帝国主义是一只纸老虎。莫三鼻给人民在莫三鼻给革命委员会的领导下，完全支持我们的越南兄弟反对美国侵略的正义斗争。他说，美帝国主义在越南犯下了滔天罪行。我们要求美国强盗完全和无条件地撤出越南领土，让越南人民自己解决自己的问题。
    在谈到莫三鼻给人民的斗争时，他说，莫三鼻给革命委员会的宗旨，是彻底解放莫三鼻给。莫三鼻给人象所有其他民族一样，希望摆脱殖民统治。为达到这个目的，莫三鼻给人准备作出最大的牺牲。他说，在莫三鼻给革命委员会成立之后不久，莫三鼻给革命委员会的行动委员会便决定对莫三鼻给的葡萄牙殖民主义者进行武装斗争。在过去五个月中，我们的游击队已经在他们驻扎的地区取得了重大的胜利。
    瓦朗蒂姆·西索尔说，莫三鼻给革命委员会认为，现在的国际革命形势极端有利于亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的被压迫人民。这一形势的造成，是由于各风暴中心的进步革命反帝力量采取了毫不妥协的立场。可是，美帝国主义还没有被打垮。必须以世界爱好和平人民的联合努力来打垮它。他说，加纳的政变是由美英帝国主义者策划和执行的。如果要使非洲取得自由，必须粉碎加纳的叛乱。
    他说，我们强烈谴责印度尼西亚右派势力粗暴干涉亚非新闻工作者协会的事务，我们还谴责野蛮地镇压、屠杀和监禁包括记者在内的印度尼西亚进步势力，我们正式表示完全支持正在反对右派法西斯军事独裁政权的印度尼西亚人民。
    他说，我们完全支持阿拉伯兄弟为收复被强占去的巴勒斯坦祖国而进行的斗争，并谴责美国要把以色列变为美国的一个侵略基地的新殖民主义计划。我们正式宣布完全声援和支持站在反帝斗争最前列的刚果兄弟、津巴布韦兄弟和其他兄弟。莫三鼻给革命委员会完全支持你们大家的斗争，因为你们的斗争也是我们的斗争。
    他说，我们毫不含糊地支持亚非新闻工作者协会总书记作的总报告和关于暂时撤离的报告，并正式宣布我们完全支持亚非新闻工作者协会为维护和保护一九六三年雅加达宣言而采取的一切行动。
