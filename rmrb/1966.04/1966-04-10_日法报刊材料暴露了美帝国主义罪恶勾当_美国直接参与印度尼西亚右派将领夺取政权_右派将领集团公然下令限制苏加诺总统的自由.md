    Xinhua News Agency, 9th. Materials published in Japanese and French newspapers have exposed the close ties between the right-wing general clique that recently seized state power in Indonesia and U.S. imperialism, demonstrating that U.S. imperialism directly participated in the right-wing general clique's conspiracy to seize state power.
    The Japanese magazine "Asahi Weekly" summarized in March an American named Conde's book on the September 30th Movement in Indonesia: "Indonesia's Invisible Coup." In the section of Conde's book entitled "Oil and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency," he wrote: "In today's world of increasingly sophisticated weapons and increasingly complex conspiracies, the task of protecting the interests (of oil companies) is primarily carried out by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency." When "Indonesia nationalized oil and other industries in 1963, an attempted revolt to overthrow the Sukarno regime occurred in Medan, behind which was the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. However, when President Sukarno nationalized the oil industry in 1965 (March), (foreign) oil companies showed surprising calm. American, British, and Dutch oil companies all agreed to accept the oil allocation network and agreed to transfer all facilities to Indonesia's state-owned monopoly enterprises."
    Conde continued, this was because "due to the implementation of oil nationalization, Indonesian generals became the heads of the oil companies. American oil companies such as Mobil and Texaco, and the British Shell Oil Company, changed the channels of (cooperation with Indonesia), that is, they changed the channels of profit transfer, which previously went directly to the headquarters in their own countries, to first going through subsidiaries in Tokyo." The matter is so clear.
    Madame Tabouis's article published in the French newspaper "Aujourd'hui Paris" on March 14th discussed how the United States directly participated in the Indonesian right-wing general clique's seizure of power. The article stated: "For some time, American institutions in Jakarta have not concealed their... methods of putting pressure on Sukarno. The role of American institutions seems to be mainly political." "What the Americans hoped to do, and what they have already succeeded in doing, is to gather the Indonesian nationalist movement, especially non-communist students and trade unions, around Suharto, and to ensure this seemingly essential connection between them. Several days ago, diplomatic observers in Jakarta reported that 'something serious was about to happen' because large American institutional vehicles were frequently traveling around the city, openly visiting the (non-communist) central trade unions, Muslim nationalist organizations, the leaders of these movements, and the well-known student federations under the name of Indonesian University Students United Action Organization."
    The article said, "It must be admitted that, on an international scale, this (the Indonesian right-wing general clique's seizure of state power) is an undeniable victory for American institutions in the Asian coast's accident-prone areas." However, "the United States, due to the intervention of its institutions, is only 'taking on' a difficult role in Indonesia."
    Xinhua News Agency, 9th. After seizing state power from President Sukarno, the Indonesian right-wing general clique openly announced a ban on the 7th, restricting President Sukarno's freedom of movement.
    According to Agence France-Presse on the 8th from Jakarta, citing "Sinar Harapan" (Ray of Hope), the head of the Indonesian Army Information Service, Subroto, announced at a meeting of Indonesian newspaper editors on the 7th that "Indonesian cabinet ministers shall not directly contact President Sukarno without the knowledge of their superior—the Deputy Prime Minister." Cabinet ministers who have contact with the head of state are obliged to report to their respective Deputy Prime Ministers on the situation of their talks with Sukarno.
    The report also stated that if President Sukarno wants to see a cabinet minister, he must first contact the Deputy Prime Minister who is the superior of the minister in question.
    A United Press International dispatch on the same day stated that no one in Jakarta now believes that President Sukarno is still the leader of Indonesia. "One reason is that Sukarno can only receive calls approved by the military. Another reason is that the military has designated eleven people (only eleven people) who can meet with Sukarno without military permission. They include First Deputy Prime Minister Leimena and several other very reliable people."

    日法报刊材料暴露了美帝国主义罪恶勾当
    美国直接参与印度尼西亚右派将领夺取政权
    右派将领集团公然下令限制苏加诺总统的自由
    新华社九日讯　日本、法国报刊发表的材料，暴露了最近在印度尼西亚夺取国家政权的右派将领集团同美帝国主义的密切联系，说明美国帝国主义直接参与了右派将领集团夺取国家政权的阴谋活动。
    日本《朝日周刊》在三月间摘要介绍了美国人康德所写的关于印度尼西亚九月三十日事件的一本书：《印度尼西亚无形的政变》。康德在这本书的题为《石油和美国中央情报局》的一节中写道：“在武器越来越精密、阴谋越来越错综复杂的今天，保护（石油公司）权益的任务，主要是由美国中央情报局来执行的。”当一九六三年“印度尼西亚实行石油等工业国营时，在棉兰曾经发生企图推翻苏加诺政权的暴动，而在它背后的是美国中央情报局。但是，一九六五年（三月）苏加诺总统实行石油工业国有化时，（外国）石油公司却表现出了令人吃惊的平静。美国、英国、荷兰的石油公司都一齐答应接受石油配给网，并且同意把一切设施移交给印度尼西亚的国营垄断企业机构。”
    康德接着写道，这是因为“由于实行石油国有化，印度尼西亚的将领们变成了石油公司的负责人，美孚、德士古等美国石油公司和英国壳牌石油公司把（同印度尼西亚）合作的渠道改变了一下，就是说，把从前直接通向本国总公司的输送利润的渠道，改变为首先经过东京的子公司。”事情就是这么明明白白。
    法国《今日巴黎报》三月十四日发表塔布伊夫人写的文章，谈到了美国是怎样直接参与了印度尼西亚右派将领集团夺取政权的勾当。文章说：“一些时候以来，美国在雅加达的机构不掩饰它们……对苏加诺施加压力的作法。美国机构的作用似乎主要是政治性的”。“美国人希望作的、以及他们业已获得成功的事情，正是使印度尼西亚民族主义运动、特别是使非共产党的学生和工会集结在苏哈托的周围，并且在他们之间保证这种看来是必不可少的联系。在若干天以前，雅加达的外交观察家曾经报道，将要‘发生某种严重的事件’，因为美国机构的大型汽车在市内来往频繁，公开地拜访（非共产党的）中央职工会、穆斯林民族主义组织、这些运动的领导人以及众所周知的在印度尼西亚大学生统一行动组织名义下的学生联合会领导人。”
    文章说，“应当承认，就国际范围来说，这（印度尼西亚右派将领集团夺取国家政权）是美国机构在亚洲沿岸易出事的地方获得的一个不可否认的胜利”。但是，“美国由于它的机构的干涉，也只不过是在印度尼西亚‘担负起’困难的角色”。
    新华社九日讯　印度尼西亚右派将领集团在从苏加诺总统手中夺取国家政权以后，七日又公然宣布了一项禁令，限制苏加诺总统的行动自由。
    据法新社八日从雅加达援引《希望之光》报道，印度尼西亚陆军新闻处处长苏布罗托七日在一次印度尼西亚报纸主编会议上宣布，“印度尼西亚内阁部长未经他的上司——副总理的知悉，不得同苏加诺总统直接联系。”同元首接触的内阁部长们有义务向各自的副总理报告同苏加诺会谈情况。
    报道还说，如果苏加诺总统想要见一名内阁部长，他也必须首先同有关部长的上级的那位副总理联系。
    合众国际社同一天发表的一条消息说，在雅加达现在没有什么人会相信苏加诺总统仍然是印度尼西亚的领袖。“一个理由是：苏加诺只能接军方批准的电话。另一个理由是：军方已指定了十一个人（只有十一个人）可以不经军方许可会见苏加诺。他们包括第一副总理莱梅纳和另外几个非常可靠的人。”
