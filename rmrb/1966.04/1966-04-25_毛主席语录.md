    Quotations from Chairman Mao
    "A high tide of socialist transformation is occurring in the rural areas throughout the country, and the masses are jubilant and inspired. This event has given all Communists a profound lesson: The masses possess such great socialist enthusiasm, so why, in many leading organs, was it not felt, or felt so little, until a few months ago? Why was what the leaders were thinking so inconsistent with what the broad masses were thinking? Taking this as a lesson, then, how should similar events and problems be handled in the future? The answer is only one sentence: Do not become divorced from the masses; be good at discovering the initiative of the masses in essence."
      Comment in the book "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside"

    毛主席语录
    “现在全国农村中已经出现了社会主义改造的高潮，群众欢欣鼓舞。这件事给了一切共产党人一个深刻的教训：群众中蕴藏了这样大的社会主义的积极性，为什么在许多领导机关，在几个月以前，居然没有感觉到，或者感觉的那样少呢？领导者们所想的同广大群众所想的，为什么那样不一致呢？以此为教训，那末，今后对于有相似情况的事件和问题，应当怎样处理才好呢？回答只有一句话，就是不要脱离群众，要善于从本质上发现群众的积极性。”
      《中国农村的社会主义高潮》一书按语
