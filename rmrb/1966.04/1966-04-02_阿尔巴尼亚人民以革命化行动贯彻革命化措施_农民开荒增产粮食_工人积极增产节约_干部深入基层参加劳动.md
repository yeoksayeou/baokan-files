　　Xinhua News Agency, Tirana – The Albanian working people are taking practical actions to actively implement the revolutionary measures put forward by the Albanian Labor Party and the government.
　　After discussing the open letter from the Labor Party to the people of the whole country, the broad masses of agricultural workers are determined to rely on their own strength to strive for self-sufficiency in grain as soon as possible. Many agricultural production cooperatives and state farms have recently written letters to the Central Committee of the Labor Party and newspaper editorial departments to report good news, and put forward guarantees and specific measures to further increase agricultural products.
　　Thanks to the active efforts of the broad masses of agricultural workers, by mid-March, more than 70,000 hectares of land had been cultivated throughout Albania, of which more than 16,000 hectares had been planted with spring crops. Many agricultural production cooperatives have completed their spring sowing tasks. Members of the Bicali Agricultural Cooperative in the Gjirokastër District overfulfilled their potato planting plan by more than three times. The Sarandë District in the south is a major fruit-producing area in Albania, and not much grain was grown there in the past. This year, the rice area has been expanded to 900 hectares, of which the high-yield fields planted by transplanting have increased more than three times compared to last year.
　　In order to expand grain production, farmers in various places are vigorously reclaiming wasteland. The area of wasteland reclaimed in the Shkodër District in the first two months of this year was three times more than in the same period last year. Members of the Gji Benaje Agricultural Cooperative in the Librazhd District have completed the five-year plan for reclaiming wasteland ahead of schedule. The Griqë Agricultural Cooperative in the Shkodër District used to rely on the state for tens of quintals of grain every year. Last year, members of the agricultural cooperative reclaimed dozens of hectares of wasteland, and as a result, they not only ensured their own rations, but also sold 900 quintals of surplus grain to the state. This year, the members have also planted potatoes on three hills that have never been planted with crops. The Indifusi Agricultural Cooperative in the Mirditë District used to be able to ensure self-sufficiency in food for only five or six months each year, but last year they had already achieved self-sufficiency for the whole year. This year, in addition to ensuring their own grain needs, they also plan to sell 100 quintals of surplus grain to the state.
　　In order to increase grain production, many cooperatives are vigorously engaging in fertilizer accumulation, especially collecting organic fertilizer. Some agricultural cooperatives have specially built cement manure storage pools. Amidst the vigorous efforts to accumulate fertilizer, the amount of fertilizer accumulated in the Shkodër District in the first two months of this year increased by two times compared to the same period last year. Last year, farmers in the Mirditë District accumulated a total of 15,000 quintals of fertilizer, but in the first two months of this year they have already accumulated 17,000 quintals of fertilizer. Members of the Mirush Cooperative in this district guarantee that each labor force will provide 50 quintals of fertilizer to the collective economy this year.
　　The open letter from the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party greatly encouraged leading cadres of party and government organs and agricultural technicians, who have gone to the forefront of agricultural production. Many chairmen of the executive committees of people's congresses in districts and townships have become directors of agricultural cooperatives; many directors of agricultural cooperatives have become ordinary agricultural workers. Leaders of the Trasari Agricultural Cooperative in the Lezhë District also initiated that leading cadres of agricultural cooperatives should participate in physical labor for at least 100 working days each year. This initiative has been responded to throughout the country. Many respondents also proposed to work 140 to 150 working days each year. At the same time, the proposal of tractor drivers at the Lezhë District tractor station to use their spare time to work 50 working days each year also received support from tractor drivers across the country.
　　After discussing the open letter from the Party Central Committee, industrial workers enthusiastically launched a campaign to increase labor productivity, carry out rationalization proposals and support agriculture. More than 5,000 employees of the "Stalin" Textile Combine put forward more than 5,000 rationalization proposals in the discussion, of which more than 4,000 have been adopted. The rationalization proposals put forward by the workers in the locomotive repair workshop saved the state 50,000 new lekë. In recent months, the wool textile factory has increased the production of 12 new varieties of wool fabrics. Recently, 30 percent of the administrative staff of the entire factory have been streamlined, and most of them directly participated in production. The "Stalin" Textile Combine has also established fixed ties with the nearby "Lenin's Road" Agricultural Cooperative, and the employees often support agricultural production in terms of labor, technology and culture. The employees of the "Enver Hoxha" Machinery Factory in the capital are determined to produce more than 100 types of machine parts this year that have always relied on imports. After streamlining its organization, 20 percent of the administrative staff of this factory have been transferred to the workshops to directly participate in production, and other party and government staff are also required to participate in one day of labor each week.
　　Commercial workers are also taking practical actions to support rural areas. They are improving the urban and rural commercial networks, improving the supply system to rural areas, especially strengthening the supply of agricultural tools and building materials to mountainous areas, and at the same time expanding the purchase of agricultural and sideline products.

### 阿尔巴尼亚人民以革命化行动贯彻革命化措施  农民开荒增产粮食　工人积极增产节约　干部深入基层参加劳动

    阿尔巴尼亚人民以革命化行动贯彻革命化措施
    农民开荒增产粮食　工人积极增产节约　干部深入基层参加劳动
    新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民正以实际行动，积极贯彻阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府提出的革命化措施。
    广大农业劳动者在讨论了劳动党给全国人民的公开信后，决心依靠自己的力量，争取尽早做到粮食自给自足。许多农业生产合作社和国营农场最近纷纷写信向劳动党中央和报纸编辑部报捷，并提出进一步增加农产品的保证和具体措施。
    由于广大农业劳动者们的积极努力，到三月中旬为止，阿尔巴尼亚全国已耕土地达七万多公顷，其中有一万六千多公顷播种了春季作物。不少农业生产合作社已完成了春播任务。吉诺卡斯特区比恰里农业社社员超额三倍完成了土豆播种计划。南部的萨兰达区是阿尔巴尼亚盛产水果的地方，过去这个区种的粮食不多。今年，水稻面积就扩大到九百公顷，其中插秧播种的高产田比去年增加了三倍多。
    各地农民为扩大粮食生产，正大力开垦荒地。斯库台区今年头两个月开垦的荒地比去年同期多三倍。利布拉什德区的吉·贝奈热农业合作社社员已提前完成了开垦荒地的五年计划。斯库台区的格里且农业社过去每年要靠国家供应几十公担粮食。去年农业社社员们开垦了几十公顷荒地，结果，不仅保证了自己的口粮，而且还卖给国家九百公担余粮。今年，社员们又在三个从来不种庄稼的山丘上种上了土豆。米尔迪塔区的英迪富锡农业社过去每年只能保证自给五六个月的口粮，去年他们已经做到了全年自给。今年，不仅保证自己需要的粮食，还计划卖给国家一百公担余粮。
    为了增产粮食，许多合作社都在大搞积肥，特别是收集有机肥料。有些农业社专门修建了水泥的积粪池。在大抓积肥声中，斯库台区今年头两个月的积肥量比去年同期增多了两倍。去年，米尔迪塔区的农民共积肥一万五千公担，但今年头两个月已经积了一万七千公担肥。这个区的米鲁什合作社社员保证今年每个劳动力向集体经济提供五十公担肥料。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央的公开信大大鼓舞了党政机关领导干部和农业技术人员，他们纷纷深入农业生产的第一线。许多区和乡的人民议会执行委员会主席当了农业合作社的社长；许多农业合作社社长成了普通的农业劳动者。莱希区特拉斯沙里农业合作社的领导人并倡议农业社领导干部每年至少参加一百个工作日的体力劳动。这一倡议得到了全国各地的响应。不少响应者还提出每年要做一百四十个到一百五十个劳动日。同时莱希区拖拉机站的拖拉机手们提出利用工余时间，每人每年作五十个劳动日的倡议也获得了各地拖拉机手们的支持。
    工业劳动者在讨论了党中央的公开信以后，热情地掀起一个提高劳动生产率、开展合理化建议和支援农业的热潮。“斯大林”纺织联合工厂的五千多名职工在讨论中，提出了五千多项合理化建议，其中有四千多项已被采纳。修机车间职工提出的合理化建议就为国家节约了五万新里克。几个月来，毛纺厂生产的毛料增加了十二种新品种。最近，全厂的行政人员精简了百分之三十，大部分直接参加了生产。“斯大林”纺织联合工厂还同附近的“列宁之路”农业合作社建立了固定的联系，职工们经常在劳动力、技术和文化方面支援农业生产。首都“恩维尔·霍查”机械厂的职工决心在今年生产一百多种过去一直依靠进口的机器零件。这个厂经过精简机构以后，已经有百分之二十的行政人员下放到车间直接参加生产，其他党政工作人员也规定每周参加一天劳动。
    商业工作者也正在以实际行动支援农村。他们改进城乡商业网，改进对农村的供货制度，特别是加强对山区的农具和建筑材料等的供应，同时扩大农副产品的收购工作。（附图片）
