    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 6th -- The Vietnamese newspaper *People's Daily* recently published a commentary pointing out that the very serious situation in Indonesia recently is, in fact, a US-orchestrated coup d'état launched by Indonesian reactionaries.

    The commentary continued that imperialist elements are gloating over the measures recently taken by the pro-American reactionaries in Indonesia against the Indonesian Communist Party and other patriotic and progressive forces in the country. Imperialism's lackeys in Asia also make no secret of their pleasure. "Malaysia's" Prime Minister Rahman claimed that the situation in Indonesia was "encouraging." This attitude of the imperialists and their lackeys exposes more clearly their policy of openly interfering in Indonesia and more forcefully proves that they are the most dangerous enemies of the Indonesian people and the people of the world.

    The commentary said that the actions of the pro-American reactionaries in Indonesia show that they are preparing to further strengthen the terror and slaughter against the Indonesian people and all patriotic and progressive people in the country. Indonesia has become a large prison, where hundreds of people are killed every day. The reactionary forces of this country are frantically carrying out their conspiracy to eliminate Indonesian patriots and democrats, destroy the revolutionary achievements of Indonesia, and stifle the revolutionary spirit of the Indonesian people, so as to make Indonesia a dependency of the United States and a new type of colony and military base for the United States, serving the US policy of aggression in Southeast Asia and the world.

    The commentary pointed out that the Vietnamese people are closely watching the serious situation created by the pro-American reactionaries in Indonesia and strongly condemn these reactionaries, demanding that they immediately stop the terror actions taken against the Indonesian people, including the Indonesian Communist Party.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 5th -- The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper *Akahata* published an article on April 3rd pointing out that the facts since the September 30th Movement to the establishment of the current military regime prove that everything has been carried out according to the "Generals' Council" coup plan. After describing the anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-Chinese atrocities of the Indonesian right-wing forces, the article said that at the same time, they sent envoys to the United States, Japan, and Western European countries to ask for assistance. This makes the United States also not conceal its happiness about the situation in Indonesia.

    The article said that US imperialism is increasingly ferociously pursuing an aggressive policy throughout Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In this vast region, the struggle between US imperialism and the people of all countries striving for independence and peace is intensifying. Under these circumstances, right-wing or military-led coups occurred in Indonesia, Ghana, and some other African countries.

    The article said that this is not surprising in the course of intense revolutionary struggle. However, while struggling with these difficulties, the people have more clearly recognized the true faces of the enemies of the revolution, imperialism and domestic reactionaries, and also recognized the correct path of revolution, thereby gaining new development.

    The article said that it is impossible to eliminate the Indonesian Communist Party, which has taken wide and deep roots among the people. Under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, the Indonesian people will surely overcome this difficulty and move forward.

    The article also exposed the Sato government of Japan for acting as an accomplice of US imperialism in helping to consolidate the reactionary rule of the Indonesian right-wing. The article said that on March 19th of this year, the Sato government decided to provide emergency economic assistance to Indonesia. Then, on March 23rd, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs clearly stated that it was studying the formation of a "Tokyo Club" (provisional name) initiated by Japan, including the United States, West Germany, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia, as an institution for international assistance to Indonesia. Imperialism, especially US imperialism, is providing assistance to the Indonesian right-wing military regime, which is brutally suppressing the Communist Party and progressive forces, in an attempt to consolidate it. However, the United States is afraid that providing open "aid" to Indonesia will be opposed by the Indonesian people and international public opinion, who have fought a long struggle against US imperialism, so Japan will have to act as an accomplice of the United States on this issue.

    越南《人民报》和日共《赤旗报》谴责美帝支持印度尼西亚右派搞政变
    美帝及其走狗要把印度尼西亚变成殖民地
    印度尼西亚人民一定会克服困难向前迈进
    新华社河内六日电　越南《人民报》最近发表评论指出，印度尼西亚近来非常严重的局势，实际上是印度尼西亚反动派发动的一场美国操纵的政变。
    评论接着说，帝国主义分子对于印度尼西亚亲美反动派最近采取的反对印度尼西亚共产党和这个国家的其他爱国和进步力量的措施兴高采烈。帝国主义在亚洲的走狗也不掩饰他们的高兴。“马来西亚”总理拉赫曼声称，印度尼西亚的局势“令人鼓舞”。帝国主义者及其走狗的这种态度更加清楚地暴露出他们公开干涉印度尼西亚的政策，而且更强有力地证明，他们是印度尼西亚人民和全世界人民的最危险的敌人。
    评论说，印度尼西亚亲美反动派的行动表明，他们正在准备进一步加强对印度尼西亚人民和这个国家的全体爱国进步人士的恐怖和屠杀。印度尼西亚已成为一个大监狱，在那里每天都有数以百计的人民遭到杀害。这个国家的反动势力正疯狂地执行他们消灭印度尼西亚爱国人士和民主人士、破坏印度尼西亚革命成果、扼杀印度尼西亚人民革命精神的阴谋，以使印度尼西亚成为美国的附属国和美国的新型殖民地和军事基地，为美国在东南亚和世界的侵略政策服务。
    评论指出，越南人民密切地注视着印度尼西亚的亲美反动派在这个国家中制造的严重局势，强烈地谴责这些反动分子，要求他们立即停止对印度尼西亚人民，包括印度尼西亚共产党人在内，采取的恐怖行动。
    新华社东京五日电　日本共产党机关报《赤旗报》四月三日发表文章指出，自从去年九月三十日运动到目前的军事政权成立为止的事实证明，一切都是按着“将领委员会”的政变计划进行的。文章在叙述印度尼西亚右派势力的反共、反人民和反华暴行后说，与此同时，他们派出使节，向美国、日本和西欧各国要求援助。这使美国也不隐蔽对印度尼西亚局势的高兴。
    文章说，美帝国主义在整个亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲越来越凶恶地推行侵略政策。在这个广阔的地区，美帝国主义和争取独立与和平的各国人民之间的斗争愈演愈烈。在这种情况下，在印度尼西亚，加纳以及其他一些非洲国家，发生了右派或军队发动的政变。
    文章说，这在激烈的革命斗争的过程中是不奇怪的。但是，人民在同这些困难进行斗争的同时更加明确地认识了革命的敌人，帝国主义和国内反动派的真面目，也认清了革命的正确道路，从而获得了新的发展。
    文章说，要消灭在人民中间广泛而深入地扎了根子的印度尼西亚共产党是不可能的。在印度尼西亚共产党的领导下，印度尼西亚人民一定会克服这一困难，向前迈进。
    文章还揭露日本佐藤政府在帮助巩固印度尼西亚右派反动统治方面充当美帝国主义帮凶。文章说，佐藤政府于今年三月十九日决定对印度尼西亚提供紧急经济援助。接着，外务省于三月二十三日又明确表示，它正在研究由日本倡议组成包括美国、西德、荷兰、苏联和南斯拉夫等参加的“东京俱乐部”（暂定的名称），作为对印度尼西亚进行国际援助的机构。帝国主义特别是美帝国主义，对残酷镇压共产党和进步力量的印度尼西亚右派军事政权，给予援助，企图把它巩固下来。但是，美国由于害怕对印度尼西亚进行公开“援助”会遭到同美帝国主义进行过长期斗争的印度尼西亚人民和国际舆论的反对，因此日本在这个问题上也就要奉命充当美国的帮凶。
