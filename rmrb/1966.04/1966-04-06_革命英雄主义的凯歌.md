    A Triumphant Song of Revolutionary Heroism
    China News Delegation
    During our days of reporting on the South Vietnam battlefield, we were constantly deeply moved by the radiant image of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces fighters. Everywhere we went, we listened to the triumphant song of their revolutionary heroism and shared in their joyous victories after fierce battles.
    Shortly after the People's Liberation Army annihilated an entire battalion of American invading troops for the first time in the D War Zone near Saigon at Duc Co in early November of last year, we spent an unforgettable evening in the deep-forest camp of this heroic unit. We met with the commanders of this heroic unit at the command post beside an ancient tree trunk several arm-spans thick. This was the most rudimentary yet strongest command post in the world, a table and several benches hastily nailed together from rough wood, with hammocks made of captured nylon cloth hanging from the tree trunk beside it. This was also the most ordinary yet bravest commander in the world, looking about thirty years old, with piercing eyes that swept away the fatigue of days of marching and fighting, and wearing a grass-green uniform faded with sweat. His calm demeanor, optimistic character, and dark complexion showed that he had been tempered by the flames of war and the storms of life.
    On November 8th of last year, this heroic unit in Duc Co, D War Zone, caught a battalion of the American invading troops' 173rd Airborne Brigade that had come out for a “sweep.” After the battle began, the soldiers of this platoon were ordered to quickly circle behind the enemy, occupy a small mound on the edge of the jungle, and use all their strength to block enemy reinforcements, ensuring that their own unit could completely annihilate the enemy battalion. The soldiers of this platoon disregarded the thorns of brambles and wild vines, scaled the narrow paths, and quickly ascended the mound. However, before fortifications could be dug, two battalions of American invading troops' reinforcements had already reached the foot of the mound, and the soldiers immediately went into battle, using fierce firepower to drive the enemy away in a state of utter disarray. Soon after, the enemy used fierce artillery fire to bombard the mound, and nine enemy planes also swooped down to bomb and strafe, causing smoke and fire to soar into the sky and dust to billow everywhere on the mound. Then, the enemy launched attacks on the mound in two directions, attempting to open a path for reinforcements as quickly as possible. The soldiers rose from the dust and, when the enemy approached the position within a few meters, opened fire fiercely, inflicting casualties on the enemy, and finally driving them back. After repelling several enemy assaults in succession, most of the soldiers in this platoon were killed, and the remaining few were also wounded. Platoon Leader A Xi, seriously wounded, calmly shouted to his comrades, "Comrades, fight resolutely! As long as one of us is alive, we will not let the enemy come up!" They held the mound for more than an hour, never letting the enemy set foot on the position. During the enemy's last attack, the soldiers ran out of bullets. Platoon Leader A Xi struggled to his feet, raised his gleaming bayonet, and shouted to the soldiers, "Comrades, the time to eliminate the American devils has come! Charge!" He led the soldiers into the enemy ranks...
    The commander excitedly told us, "After the battle ended, we saw these heroic soldiers on the battlefield, sacrificed amidst piles of enemy corpses, some with bayonets thrust into the enemy's chests, some with gun butts smashing the enemy's heads, and some biting the enemy's necks. Comrade O of the machine gun team had his muzzle pointed at the enemy's chest, his finger still on the trigger. They shed their last drop of blood and exerted their last bit of strength for the motherland and the people. These soldiers eliminated about a hundred American invaders, but more importantly, they bought time for the main force to completely annihilate an enemy battalion."
    The commander handed us a copy of the letter of determination written by the soldiers of this platoon at a meeting denouncing the crimes of American imperialism before the battle. The letter of determination read: "American robbers kill our compatriots and burn our villages. Anger burns in our chests, and hatred weighs on our hearts. Please give us the most arduous task, and we vow to stain our bayonets with the blood of the American invaders and avenge our motherland and our compatriots."
    Just as we were reading this letter of determination with excitement, the sentry outside shouted, "Planes, planes!" The commander blew out the oil lamp on the table. Soon, the sound of American planes came from the sky above the jungle, and the light of flares shone through the dense foliage. But the commander's deep voice drowned out the roar of the planes: "Our soldiers are soldiers with a high degree of awareness, organization, and discipline. For the sake of the motherland and the people, they can sacrifice everything and never take a step back. Our soldiers use their bayonets to declare to the world that the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces, such a steel-like people's army, can completely defeat the American invaders."
    After the enemy planes flew away, the commander lit the oil lamp. At this time, in the depths of the forest, one by one, faint lights lit up again, like stars in the sky. From the lights came the sound of soldiers singing and applauding.
    These moving stories are commonplace on the South Vietnam battlefield, and these great heroes are also commonplace heroes in the ranks of the Liberation Army. They are all ordinary people: farmers, workers, rubber plantation workers, students, and many, many people who were oppressed and humiliated in the old society. Under the education of the National Liberation Front and in the tempering of the revolutionary flames of war, they have raised their political consciousness and understood why they are fighting and for whom they are fighting. They are all highly conscious and courageous soldiers, and for the sake of the motherland and the people, they can scale mountains of knives and plunge into seas of fire, and they must thoroughly eliminate the enemy.
    One afternoon, we visited a unit of the Liberation Army that participated in the battle to capture the enemy's Dong Shuai stronghold in June of last year. Comrades from the Liberation Army guided us along a rushing stream into a dense primeval forest. Outside the forest, the sun was still blazing hot, but inside the forest, it was already very dim and slightly cool. We walked through the dense forest, past one sentry post after another, and finally arrived at the camp of this unit. Hidden under the cover of this primeval forest, there was actually such a large "city." Soldiers' hammocks were tied everywhere on the tree trunks, and soldiers were active everywhere. Some were writing on small tables made of rough tree trunks, some were wiping the modern American weapons they had just captured, and some were mending clothes torn in battle. Beside the smokeless stove dug in the ground, some soldiers were skinning a wild boar and several yellow goats they had just hunted, and some were cutting the wild vegetables they had gathered, preparing for tonight's "grand feast."
    Under a large tree, the soldiers enthusiastically gathered around us and told us, in simple and vivid language, the heroic stories of this battle. These heroic achievements are not the achievements of one or two people, but the victory of all their soldiers, the victory of the Liberation Army's noble qualities of wholeheartedly serving the people and fighting for the people.
    On the second day after the battle of Dong Shuai began, Nguyen Van Tuong, a combat squad leader of this unit, was ordered to lead three other soldiers to escort some wounded soldiers to the rear. After completing this task, they immediately rushed back to the front line. As they were walking, they saw a village ahead engulfed in flames, and the cries of the residents could be heard. They quickly rushed into the village. When the residents saw the Liberation Army coming, they all rushed up and wept, saying that four puppet army tanks had just left here. These bandits had carried out looting and set fire to the houses before leaving. The four of them were filled with anger. After discussing for a while, they decided to take a small path to eliminate these four enemy tanks. They quickly crossed the jungle and streams and came to the highway. Sure enough, four tanks soon drove up, rushing to the nearby enemy stronghold. When the tanks entered the ambush circle, they quickly threw grenades, destroying the first two tanks. The two tanks behind them retaliated fiercely while quickly trying to escape. Nguyen Van Tuong immediately led his comrades to rush forward to block the enemy tanks. He jumped onto a tank, pulled open the iron cover, and threw in a hand grenade. Then, his comrades destroyed another tank. At this time, the puppet army from the nearby stronghold had already mobilized to come to their aid. Seeing that the enemy outnumbered them, he immediately ordered his comrades to quickly withdraw from the battle. He opened fire fiercely to cover his comrades' retreat. When he finally retreated into the dense forest beside the highway, he and his comrades became separated. After walking in the jungle for a while, he fell down, seriously injured in both his left and right feet. After waking up from his coma, he tore open his clothes to bandage his wounds, then gritted his teeth and crawled on the ground, enduring the severe pain. The skin on his arms and legs was worn out, and his clothes were torn by the thorns of the brambles, but he still crawled forward step by step. After midnight, he accidentally fell into a very deep bomb crater in the darkness. He tried his best to climb out of the bomb crater, but each time he failed. Finally, he passed out again. The next morning, the guerrillas patrolling in the forest discovered him and carried him back to the unit.
    In the deep jungle nights of the South Vietnam battlefield, we lay on our hammocks together with these lovely soldiers. From the depths of the forest came waves of insect chirps and deer calls. The sentries' light footsteps fell on the fallen leaves, making sure not to disturb their comrades in the slightest. The soldiers emitted soft snores, resting quietly. Tomorrow, they will pick up their weapons again and march heroically to the battlefield to engage in a brave fight with the evil enemy. The simple minds of American imperialism and its lackeys will never understand the boundless spiritual power of these soldiers who are armed with the ideology of revolutionary heroism and who are fighting for the motherland and the people. This spiritual power of the people's army can move mountains and overturn seas, change the world, and create miracles that shock the whole world. (Attached picture)

    革命英雄主义的凯歌
    中国新闻代表团
    在越南南方战场上采访的日子里，我们时时刻刻被越南南方解放武装力量战士们光辉的形象深深地激动着。我们到处倾听过他们革命英雄主义的凯歌，分享过他们在激烈战斗后胜利的欢乐。
    在去年十一月初解放军在西贡附近D战区的德古第一次歼灭美国侵略军一个营以后不久，我们在这支英雄部队密林深处的营地里度过了一个难忘的夜晚。我们在一棵好几围粗的古老的树干旁的指挥所里，会见了这支英雄部队的指挥员。这是世界上最简陋的但是最坚强的指挥所，用粗木头临时钉起来的一张桌子和几张长凳子，旁边的树干上挂着缴获的尼龙布制成的吊床。这也是一个世界上最平凡的但是最勇敢的指挥员，他看上去大约三十多岁，炯炯有神的眼光扫除了这几天来行军和作战的困乏，穿着一套被汗水浸得变了色的草绿色制服。他沉着的神态，乐观的性格和黝黑的肤色，显示了饱经战火和风雨的锻炼。
    去年十一月八日，这支英雄部队在D战区的德古抓住了出来“扫荡”的美国侵略军第一七三空降旅的一个营。在战斗打响后，这个班的战士们奉命迅速绕到敌人背后，占领一座在丛林边缘上的小土岗，用一切力量堵住敌人的增援，保证自己部队全歼敌人的这个营。这个班的战士们不顾荆棘野藤的尖刺，攀越小道，迅速登上了这座土岗。但是，工事还没有挖好，美国侵略军两个营的增援部队已到了土岗脚下，战士们立刻投入战斗，用猛烈的火力把敌人打得狼狈逃窜。不一会，敌军用猛烈的炮火对土岗轰击，九架敌机也俯冲轰炸扫射，打得土岗上烟火冲天，尘土滚滚。接着，敌军分两路向土岗发动攻击，力图以最快速度打开增援的道路。战士们从尘土中翻起身来，等敌人接近阵地几米时，就猛烈开火杀伤敌人，最后把敌人打了回去。在接连打退敌人的几次冲锋后，这个班的战士们大部分牺牲了，其他的几个也都负了伤。班长阿席负了重伤，沉着地对战友们喊道，“同志们，坚决战斗，只要我们有一个人活着，就不让敌人上来。”他们在土岗上坚守了一个多小时，始终没有让敌人踏上阵地一步。在敌人最后一次攻击时，战士们的子弹都打光了，班长阿席挣扎着站起来，挺起寒光闪闪的刺刀，对战士们喊道，“同志们，消灭美国鬼子的时候到了，冲呀！”他带着战士们冲进了敌阵……
    指挥员激动地对我们说，“在战斗结束以后，我们在战场上看到这些英勇的战士们牺牲在敌人的尸体堆中，有的刺刀插进了敌人的胸膛，有的用枪托打烂了敌人的脑袋，有的咬住了敌人的脖子。机枪组奥同志的枪口对准着敌人的胸脯，手指还扣在扳机上。他们为祖国和人民，流了最后一滴血，尽了最后一份力量。这些战士们消灭了大约一百个美国侵略者，但是更重要的是他们为主力部队全歼敌军一个营取得了时间。”
    指挥员递给我们一份这个班的战士们在战斗前举行的控诉美帝国主义罪行的大会上写的一份决心书。决心书这样写着：“美国强盗杀死我们的同胞，烧毁我们的村庄。愤怒在我们胸中燃烧，仇恨压在我们心头。请你们交给我们最艰巨的任务，我们誓把美国侵略者的血染红刺刀，为我们的祖国和同胞报仇雪恨。”
    正在我们激动地读这封决心书的时候，外面的哨兵喊起来：“飞机，飞机！”指挥员吹熄了桌上的油灯。不久，丛林上空传来了美国飞机的声音，照明弹的光亮从密密的枝叶间透进来。但是，指挥员深沉的声音压倒了飞机的轰鸣：“我们的战士就是这样有高度觉悟和组织性纪律性的战士，他们为了祖国和人民可以牺牲自己的一切，决不后退一步。我们的战士用自己的刺刀向全世界宣告，越南南方解放武装力量这样一支钢铁的人民军队是完全可以打败美国侵略者的。”
    敌机飞过去后，指挥员点上了油灯。这时，在森林深处，一点又一点微弱的火光又亮起来，象是天上的星星。从火光处传来了战士们唱歌和鼓掌的声音。
    这些可歌可泣的故事，在南越战场上是平常的故事，这些伟大的英雄，在解放军的行列中也是平常的英雄。他们都是些平凡的人：农民，工人，橡胶园工人，学生，以及许许多多旧社会里被压迫被侮辱的人。他们在民族解放阵线的教育下和在革命烽火的锻炼中，提高了政治觉悟，懂得了为何而战，为谁而战。他们个个都是有高度自觉的英勇战士，为了祖国和人民，他们可以上刀山下火海，一定要把敌人彻底消灭。
    有一天下午，我们访问了参加过去年六月间攻克敌军东帅据点的战斗的一支解放军部队。解放军的同志引导我们沿着一条湍急的溪流进入了一座浓密的原始森林。森林外面还是一团火热的太阳，但在森林里面却已非常昏暗，微微有些凉意，我们在密林中穿行，经过一个个岗哨，终于来到了这个部队的营地。在这片原始森林的掩盖下，原来还有这样一个大城市呢。到处树干上绑着战士们的吊床，到处都有战士们在活动。他们有的趴在用粗树干钉起来的小桌子上写字，有的在擦拭刚缴获来的美国现代化武器，有的在缝补在战斗中撕破的衣服。在挖在地上的无烟灶旁边，有些战士正在剥他们刚打获来的一头野猪和几只黄羊，有些正在切他们采来的野菜，准备今天晚上的“大会餐”。
    在一棵大树底下，战士们热情地围着我们坐下来，用朴实而生动的语言，给我们讲述了在这次战斗中的英雄故事。这些英雄的业绩不是一个人两个人的，而是他们全体战士的胜利，是解放军全心全意为人民服务、为人民战斗的高贵品质的胜利。
    在东帅战斗打响后第二天，这个部队的一个战斗小组长阮文相奉命率领另外三个战士护送一些伤员到后方去。他们完成这个任务后立刻赶回前线去。他们正走着的时候，看到前面的一个村庄火光冲天，传来了居民的哭喊声。他们迅速赶进村子里去。居民们看到解放军来到，都涌上来哭诉说，四辆伪军坦克刚刚离开这里，这些匪徒进行了抢劫，临走时还点火烧了房子。他们四个人怒火冲天，商量了一阵，决定绕小路前去消灭这四辆敌军坦克。他们迅速穿过丛林和溪流来到了公路上，果然不久开来了四辆坦克，急急地向附近的敌军据点开去。等坦克进入伏击圈，他们就迅速扔出了手雷，炸毁了前面的两辆坦克。后面的两辆坦克一面进行猛烈还击，一面迅速夺路逃命。阮文相立即率领战友们冲上前去堵住敌人的坦克。他跳上一辆坦克，拉开铁盖扔进了一个手榴弹。接着，战友们又摧毁了另外一辆坦克。这时，附近据点的伪军已经出动前来增援了。他一看敌众我寡，立刻命令战友们迅速撤出战斗。他猛烈开火掩护战友们撤退。等他最后撤进公路旁的密林中的时候，战友们失散了。他在丛林中走了一阵后倒下去了，他的左右脚都负了重伤。他从昏迷中醒过来后，就撕开自己衣服包扎了伤口，然后咬着牙，忍着剧痛在地上爬着走。他的胳膊和腿上的皮肤都磨破了，衣服也被荆棘的尖刺撕烂了，但是仍然一步步向前爬去。半夜过后，他在黑暗中不小心跌进了一个很深的炸弹坑里，他用最大的毅力想从炸弹坑里爬出来，但是每一次都失败了。最后，他又昏过去了。第二天上午，在森林中巡逻的游击队发现了他，把他抬回了部队。
    在南越战场的丛林深夜里，我们同这些可爱的战士们一起躺在自己的吊床上。森林深处传来一阵又一阵的虫鸣和鹿叫。哨兵们轻轻的脚步踩在落叶上，不让有一点声音打扰自己的战友们。战士们发出轻轻的鼾声，沉静地憩睡着。明天，他们又将拿起武器雄赳赳地奔赴战场，同万恶的敌人进行英勇的搏斗。美帝国主义和它的走狗们简单的头脑永远不会理解这些被革命英雄主义思想武装起来的为祖国和人民而战的战士们的无限精神力量。这种人民军队的精神力量能够排山倒海，改天换地，创造出震惊全世界的奇迹来。（附图片）
