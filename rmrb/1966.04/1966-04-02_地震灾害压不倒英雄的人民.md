    Editor's Note: How are the broad masses of people in the earthquake-stricken areas living and working now? This is a matter of great concern to our readers. In this report, we see them fighting, advancing, and "relying on our own efforts, striving for progress, developing production, and rebuilding their homes." The disaster area is filled with an exciting scene of tension and order, calmness and optimism.

    Mao Zedong Thought commands everything. In the midst of fierce struggle and difficult circumstances, people have a deeper understanding of the enormous power of Mao Zedong Thought. The strong earthquake occurred suddenly, causing great difficulties for the people in the disaster area. How to deal with difficulties? How to persist in the struggle? How to handle the relationship between the individual and the collective? How to rely on the superior socialist system to rebuild our homes through self-reliance? Everything must be thought about and acted upon according to Mao Zedong Thought. The broad masses of cadres and people in the disaster area did this, and sure enough, they took the initiative in the face of the earthquake "monster". "Vow to have the determination of the Foolish Old Man who removed the mountains, and rebuild our new homes with our own hands!" This is the conclusion.

    People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest combat power. The people in the earthquake-stricken areas have fought against Japanese imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and natural disasters such as floods and droughts, and have achieved great victories. Now, they are facing a new test. Relying on the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the support of our country and various fraternal regions, they have already achieved great victories. We believe that they will achieve a complete victory and become even stronger in this arduous struggle.

    On March 8th, a strong earthquake occurred in the Xingtai area of Hebei Province. Since then, several more earthquakes have occurred in the southern part of Hebei Province, including two strong earthquakes centered in the Xingtai area and including the Hengshui and Shijiazhuang areas on the afternoon of March 22nd. The continuous and frequent shaking of the earth could bring some degree of damage to people at any time. How to deal with this natural disaster is a severe test for the people in the earthquake-stricken areas.

    In recent days, our correspondents have witnessed many facts in the earthquake-stricken areas, showing that the masses of people here have armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought and have successfully withstood this test. The disaster brought about by the earthquake has tempered people to be strong and calm. Many cadres and masses told reporters that since the earthquake, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, as well as the people of the whole country and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, have given them great support and spiritual encouragement, adding infinite strength to the masses in the disaster area. They said that although the earthquake is a new problem they have encountered, as long as they have Mao Zedong Thought and the hard-bone spirit of the proletariat, the earthquake is not to be feared, and the disaster can be completely overcome.

    "The earth moves, but our hearts do not; houses collapse, but our will does not."

    In the face of several strong and continuous earthquakes, everyone faces a very sharp question: when an earthquake comes, will you panic, or will you remain calm and composed? Since entering the earthquake-stricken area, our reporter has felt more and more deeply that the masses here have begun to grasp the temper of the earthquake "monster" and are fighting it in a more organized manner.

    On the banks of a large river, we saw people using lime and bricks to build two rows of huge slogans: "Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful weapon for overcoming earthquake disasters!" "Earthquake disasters cannot crush the heroic people!" At a mass meeting of several thousand people, we saw a county party secretary raise his fist and lead people in shouting slogans: "The earth moves, but our hearts do not; houses collapse, but our will does not!" A Communist Party member named Xie Zhishan told reporters: "The earthquake cannot crush our thinking; the more it shakes us, the more we must bring out our revolutionary spirit. We can only fight against difficulties; we cannot bow our heads!" These words, full of heroic spirit, can be heard everywhere in the disaster area.

    When two strong earthquakes occurred on the afternoon of March 22nd, our reporters were on the scene in the earthquake zone, some talking with commune members and others listening to meetings of the disaster relief headquarters. The calm and fearless spirit of the cadres and masses in the disaster area at that time left a very deep impression on the reporters.

    At a little after four o'clock that afternoon, the earth suddenly shook and houses swayed, and the earth's crust emitted a muffled thunder-like sound. Some village houses collapsed, raising a cloud of dust, and in some fields, groundwater with mud and sand gushed out of the ground. At this time, the reporter found that people were no longer as surprised as they were after the strong earthquake on the morning of the 8th, but were orderly and calm in the face of danger. Because some of the masses had already moved into temporary shelters before this earthquake, and because the rescue work was well done when the earthquake occurred, although some houses collapsed, there were fewer casualties to people and animals, and the masses were in a stable mood.

    The reporter saw in the disaster area that after the earthquake, local cadres and the masses immediately divided into two groups, one to grasp disaster relief and the other to grasp production. Despite the fact that aftershocks continued in the days that followed, commune members still went to the fields with hoes on their shoulders, cadres still held meetings to arrange work, and elementary schools still held classes. If it weren't for the collapsed rubble and broken walls in front of them, this would hardly seem like an earthquake-stricken area.

    The facts tell us that before the earthquake comes, as long as people's accommodation is arranged well and efforts are made to avoid and reduce the loss of life and property, the earthquake will not pose any great threat to people. Ren Zengshan, the party secretary of a commune, put it well: "An earthquake cannot shake down people who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought. If the house falls down, the land is still there, and the people are still there. If there are people, there is everything." The words of Lü Mingxi, a poor peasant commune member who was injured, were even more full of hard-bone spirit. He said: "My leg is broken, but I still have two hands. I can't walk, but I can still crawl. I will crawl and work! If I can add a brick, I will add a brick; if I can add a tile, I will add a tile. As long as I have breath, I will fight to the end!"

    "You shake yours, and I'll do mine!" Reporters heard cadres and masses say this in more than one place. This heroic saying, which is widely circulated in the disaster area, fully demonstrates the revolutionary spirit of the heroic people calmly responding to the challenge. Indeed, only such a revolutionary attitude can be adopted towards earthquakes. Can we stand idly by in the face of earthquakes?

    "You shake yours, and I'll do mine!" This sentence also truly reflects the heroic spirit of the people in the disaster area fighting tenaciously in the face of the earthquake. Old poor peasant Li Qinghai and young commune member Zhai Hejun were digging a well in the field when the strong earthquake occurred on the 22nd. They saw dust rising from the village and ran home to see what was happening. When they entered the village, they found that although the houses had collapsed, no one was injured, so they immediately rushed back to the construction site. At that time, what they had in mind was that this well had already been drilled to a depth of fifteen zhang, and if they left it unattended, the well shaft would be in danger of collapsing at any time, which would delay this year's struggle against drought. Li Qinghai said to Zhai Hejun: "Let it shake! No matter how big the earthquake, it can't shake our revolutionary hearts. To make revolution, you have to have decisiveness!" After that, the earthquake did not completely stop, but the old poor peasant and Zhai Hejun persisted at the construction site for three days and three nights. In a production brigade that had suffered losses in the March 8th earthquake, He Quansheng, the vice chairman of the poor peasants' association, was arranging for commune members to rebuild their houses in the village on the afternoon of the 22nd when the earth suddenly shook. He could not stand still and was injured by a collapsing brick wall. After being admitted to the "battlefield hospital," he uttered delirious words in his coma, still thinking about building houses. He Quansheng had worked as a hired farmhand for six years in the old society, and his father starved to death while fleeing the famine in the great drought of 1943. This old poor peasant, who has always loved the collective, said to reporters on his sickbed: "No matter what the earthquake does, I am going to serve the people anyway. I must help everyone rebuild their homes!"

    Seeing these heroic people, each of whom is full of courage, and hearing these resounding heroic words, the reporter was deeply moved by their revolutionary spirit. What kind of mental state should a person of the Mao Zedong era use to fight against earthquake disasters? The masses here have given the best answer with their words and actions.

    "As long as you are prepared, you are not afraid of anything."

    The people in the disaster area here not only have the heroic courage to be unafraid in the face of a major disaster, but also have made full preparations for long-term disaster prevention and relief. Their work is done so meticulously and so thoroughly, and their vigilance is so high. This makes us strongly feel that the earthquake has tempered the people and made them smarter.

    After the strong earthquake on March 22nd, the reporter rushed to a severely affected village with more than 3,200 people. We saw hundreds of temporary stoves, with smoke curling up from them. Around the village, hundreds of shacks had been set up. Some commune members were repairing farm tools, some were cultivating sweet potato seedlings, and some were moving bricks and wood or clearing house foundations in preparation for rebuilding their homes. On the threshing floor, the brigade party branch was holding a meeting of party members, League members, and representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants to discuss the great plan of self-reliance and rebuilding their homes. Life here is full of a strong fighting atmosphere. Many tasks are being carried out simultaneously, but they are busy without being chaotic.

    Why is the village so orderly after a major earthquake? It turns out that the party branch of this brigade, as early as after the March 8th earthquake, had fully mobilized the masses according to the instructions of the county party committee and made thorough arrangements for earthquake prevention and relief work. Zhang Zhenhua, the brigade leader who had served as a scout for the Eighth Route Army during the War of Resistance Against Japan, said firmly and confidently at the party branch meeting: "Earthquakes are like fighting a war. The only thing to fear is not being prepared beforehand. As long as you are prepared, you are not afraid of anything." After that, the brigade disaster relief headquarters, with the party branch as the core, was established. Party branch members were assigned to different areas, and party members and League members were assigned to different households. The plan to mobilize the masses was implemented, and in just two or three days, the entire village was led by them to set up hundreds of temporary shelters, and farm tools and grain were properly arranged. Young militiamen re-studied Chairman Mao's teachings on serving the people and eagerly signed up to stand guard for commune members, cooperate with cadres on duty and patrol. Therefore, when the strong earthquake occurred on the 22nd, the people of the whole village were calm and composed, and the losses were minor. Although most of the houses collapsed, the post-disaster life, production, construction, and other tasks were carried out smoothly according to plan.

    There are far more than just this one brigade like this in the disaster area. The victories that people have won in their struggle against earthquakes are precisely the result of their acceptance of Chairman Mao's great teaching that we should despise the enemy strategically and value the enemy tactically. It is no exaggeration to say that all of this is simply a miracle in human history. In all historical records, who has ever seen such a record: the people who have suffered disaster are organized, without being pessimistic and disappointed, but with a hundredfold confidence and high morale, using collective wisdom and strength to carry out a victorious struggle against the earthquake?

    In another production brigade, the reporter visited Li Rentang, a 62-year-old old feeder. This old party member, who joined the party in 1944, was sitting in the feeding room late one night after the earthquake on the 8th, pondering a question: We were not afraid of fighting the Japanese invaders in the past, and we should not be afraid of earthquakes even more. If another major earthquake occurs, how can we get the collective livestock out of the shed as quickly as possible? He pondered for a long time and suddenly thought: Earthquakes come quickly. To rescue the livestock, it is no good to slowly untie the reins. He immediately went home, took a kitchen knife and a sickle, sharpened them quickly, and kept them by his side at all times. As soon as the first strong earthquake on the 22nd began, he raised his kitchen knife and cut off the reins tying the livestock one by one in an instant. Eight minutes later, when the second strong earthquake came, he had already driven seven head of livestock out of the shed. Li Rentang, this bold and careful man, thought so thoroughly for the collective, but completely disregarded his own safety. What he sharpened was not actually a kitchen knife or a sickle, but the revolutionary will to wage war against nature, and the red heart and loyalty to serve the people!

    Being calm in the face of danger and being resourceful and brave is a huge spiritual force. With this spiritual force, people can cope with everything and overcome everything. In the short eight minutes of rescue combat between the two earthquakes on the afternoon of the 22nd, many heroic deeds of sacrificing oneself to save others and putting the public before the private emerged. These were eight minutes of combat, eight minutes of testing people's will. A militia platoon, known as the "Iron Militia," risked their lives to check every household and carry out all the old and children who could not walk from the village, so that no one in the entire team was injured or killed. Female commune member Zhao Peiying was escorting two elderly people in their 70s when another strong earthquake occurred. In an instant, walls collapsed and houses collapsed. Zhao Peiying, regardless of her personal safety, hugged the elderly and lay down, using her body to protect the two elderly people. Elementary school teacher Fu Tingyin was teaching in a low shack when the earthquake occurred. When the roof of the shack collapsed, he used his shoulders to prop up the falling roof beams, preventing more than 30 students from being injured. It was these brave people who reduced the damage from the earthquake to the lowest limit.

    Earthquakes can cause losses to people's lives and property, but in the face of people who have armed their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, disasters can be overcome and losses can be reduced or even avoided. In the face of the earthquake "monster," the people in the disaster area waged an unprecedented and fearless battle with ingenuity and courage.

    "If you can get up on your own, don't rely on others to help you!"

    In recent days, cars loaded with grain, daily necessities, and building materials have driven to the disaster area from all directions. The people in the disaster area have received enormous support from the government and the people of the whole country at this most difficult moment. The masses in many villages were moved to tears when they received the relief supplies from all over the country. The old poor peasants who had suffered in the old society said: "If we had encountered such a disaster in the old society, even if we weren't crushed to death, we would have starved to death!" "Chairman Mao's heart is close to us. No matter how great the difficulties, we are not afraid!"

    However, how do the heroic people in the disaster area view the support from the state and fraternal regions? In many villages, the disaster relief departments distributed pots, bowls, straw mats, and wood, but after a few days, because some villages tried their best to be careful and thrifty and save state resources, some villages tried their best to solve their own difficulties if they had a way to do so. As a result, some relief supplies were returned, and they asked the disaster relief departments to transfer these supplies to places with more difficulties. When some production brigades asked commune members to collect relief supplies, the commune members yielded to each other, making it difficult to implement the relief supply distribution plan for a while. One production brigade transferred the seven bags of large cakes they received to another production brigade, but that production brigade transferred the seven bags of large cakes to yet another production brigade. Are the masses in these places really not experiencing any difficulties after the major disaster? Of course not. It is the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance that has inspired the fighting spirit of the masses in the disaster area. They are using a completely new ideology and style to meet the difficulties.

    The militia company of one production brigade put forward a slogan of action: "If you rely on relief by reaching out, your hands will become longer and longer; if you do it yourself, the more you do, the richer you will become!"

    In a production brigade with only 62 households and 214 people, the commune members shouted an even louder battle cry: "If you can get up on your own, don't rely on others to help you!" When the earthquake occurred, all the houses in this brigade collapsed. When the commune members discussed it, they put forward the battle cry of "Vow to have the determination of the Foolish Old Man who removed the mountains, and rebuild our new homes with our own hands!" They formulated a blueprint for building a new socialist countryside and began construction. How to solve the problem of bricks and wood for building houses? The commune members went separately to dig them out of the soil. They have now collected 560,000 bricks, more than 400 beams and purlins. The lime was collected by each household, and the building tools were also solved by themselves. In this way, the bricks, materials, and other supplies for building 130 houses are basically ready. More than 70 semi-able-bodied laborers in the entire team were put into the two battle lines of production and house building. Children of eight or nine years old automatically organized themselves to move bricks and transport ash. Commune members over the age of 70 also took the initiative to find work to do.

    Seeing the hot labor scene in this village, the reporter was reminded of a few meaningful words said by a commune party committee secretary: "Material support is limited, the creative power of hands is unlimited, and the power of spiritual wealth is even more infinite."

    In a village with more than 820 households, most of the houses were knocked down by the earthquake. The next day after the earthquake, the state sent 300 mats for the commune members to build shacks. On this day, at a discussion meeting to study Chairman Mao's writings, the commune members enthusiastically discussed the relationship between state support and self-reliance. Poor peasant commune member Hu Lisheng said: "What Chairman Mao sent people to give us is not just 300 mats, but the courage to fight against heaven and earth." Poor peasant commune member Hu Genchao said: "If the house collapses, the people are still there. We don't want things or money from the state; we just want Mao Zedong Thought." As a result of the discussion, the commune members dug up kang mats and sorghum stalks from the collapsed houses and built more than 900 mat sheds, leaving the 300 mats sent by the state to the team to build cowsheds and grain barns. The commune members said: "If you fall, get up on your own. That's what a good person should do. We will never increase the burden on the state!"

    Let us take a look at the revolutionary ambition of Zhou Zaolin, a 63-year-old old poor peasant! The old man said: "My eldest son was an Eighth Route Army soldier and later died. This earthquake killed my fourth son. But I still have two sons, two daughters-in-law, and four grandchildren. I will tell my sons, daughters-in-law, and grandchildren to go to the fields to work. Production cannot be delayed. Otherwise, we will eat relief grain this year, and we will have to eat it next year. In times of difficulty, we must look forward. We must rely on our own efforts!" "Self-reliance!" "Look forward!" What a grand and ambitious vision this ordinary Chinese peasant has!

    The reporter saw in the disaster area that many cadres who participated in the disaster relief work widely publicized Mao Zedong Thought to the masses in the disaster area while distributing the state's support materials. They proposed to distribute the state's support materials and the idea of self-reliance together, so that materials can be transformed into the revolutionary spirit that inspires the people's fighting spirit.

    In this area, there has been a successful example of developing the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance in the face of natural disasters. When the Nanhui Brigade of the Xihuangcun Commune in Xingtai County suffered a major flood disaster in 1963, most of the houses and crops were destroyed, but the commune members built more than 200 new houses and repaired more than 400 old houses in just two years. The total grain output last year increased by more than double compared to the previous year, and they achieved grain self-sufficiency in the second year after the disaster, and also sold grain to the state. Now, the disaster relief headquarters here is calling on the masses in the disaster area to launch a "learn from Nanhui" movement. People will see that the Nanhui spirit will become a banner to encourage the masses in the disaster area to overcome the earthquake disaster, and there will be more "new Nanhui" emerging.

    "Find what you lost at home in the fields"

    The reporter saw in many disaster-stricken villages the inspiring scene of production activities being quickly restored not long after the disaster. In some villages, houses have collapsed, and people can only live in temporary shacks; some commune members are saddened by the injuries or deaths of their loved ones. However, under the impact of such a severe disaster, people have not been pessimistic and disappointed, but have wiped away their tears, healed their wounds, and quickly went to the fields in groups.

    Now the busy season of spring plowing is approaching, and field activities seem very busy. In the green wheat fields, people are hoeing, watering, and topdressing; on large tracts of plowed land, people are driving cattle to harrow the land; in the villages, some are repairing farm tools, and the sound of sawing wood and forging iron can be heard everywhere; some are selecting seeds and raising seedlings, preparing for spring planting. All these activities are not surprising in normal years, but as long as you think about what kind of environment and atmosphere these activities are taking place in, people cannot help but feel how tenacious the people here are in the face of disaster.

    A commune member once said to the visiting personnel sent by the higher authorities: "What we lost at home, we must find it back in the fields!" What he meant was that the earthquake knocked down our houses and injured our loved ones, but we must never succumb to difficulties, but must fight the earth even more tenaciously, so that it will give us more food and compensate for the losses. What a wonderful statement full of revolutionary heroism! This sentence has now spread throughout the disaster area and has become a resounding slogan to encourage the masses to step up production and overcome the earthquake disaster.

    After such a major earthquake, one can imagine that the post-disaster recovery work is really complicated and everything needs to be done. The disaster relief headquarters recently discussed how to arrange disaster relief work and how to grasp the main contradictions. Everyone unanimously agreed that the more severe the disaster, the more efforts must be made to do a good job in production. We must call on the masses to rely closely on the collective and use their own hands to win a bumper agricultural harvest this year. This is the fundamental way to overcome the disaster. This policy is a reflection of the spirit of being highly responsible to the people and is based on the long-term interests of the state, the collective, and the people.

    Such a guiding ideology also reflects the wishes of the broad masses of cadres and people in the disaster area. Yuan Shishen, the party secretary of a commune, told reporters that the commune and brigade cadres and representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants there had held a meeting after the earthquake to study the disaster relief work. They discussed the relationship between developing production and rebuilding their homes. After discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that only by doing a good job in production can we have the strength to rebuild our homes. This year, we have encountered an "earthquake year," but we must turn it into a bumper harvest year. The meeting decided to organize 70% of the labor force to go to the fields to produce, strengthen wheat field management, and fire the first shot for a bumper summer harvest this year. The reporter also heard the captain Jie Hengliang say in another production team: "If we are frightened by the earthquake and production is not good, then after the autumn, one disaster will become two disasters. If we are not afraid of it, and it shakes its, and I do mine, and we have a bumper harvest in the autumn, then not only will one disaster not become two disasters, but we can also make up for this earthquake disaster."

    Many disaster-stricken communes and brigades have also seriously analyzed the consequences of the earthquake disaster, looked for favorable factors from unfavorable conditions, and re-discussed production plans. Everyone believes that although the earthquake has brought some losses, through disaster relief, people have further mastered the weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, have seen more clearly the superiority of the socialist system and the great power of the collective, their ideological awareness has been greatly improved, and their enthusiasm for production is even greater. One brigade suffered no losses to people or livestock during the earthquake. This time, when discussing the production plan, it was decided to increase the planned grain yield per mu by another 100 jin and the cotton yield per mu by another 20 jin. This plan was quickly accepted by the masses. Song Luoming, a 68-year-old commune member, said: "That's how it should be done. If production is good, everything will be easy to solve."

    People's determination immediately turned into action. A battle to seize grain from the land and strive for high yields has now begun universally in the disaster area. Several hundred irrigation canals built by a county last winter and this spring were damaged to varying degrees in this earthquake. And repairing canals to divert water and transform dry land is one of the main measures this county will take this year to win a bumper agricultural harvest. The day after the earthquake, the county party committee held a meeting to deploy and mobilize all the commune members in the county to repair the canals. On the third day, many communes and brigades immediately took action. They spent only three days to repair all the canals in the county, and now they have opened the gates to divert water to irrigate the wheat fields.

    "Self-reliance, striving for progress, developing production, and rebuilding our homes" This slogan has taken root in the hearts of the people in the disaster area and is being transformed into the actions of millions of people, forming a huge material force. It can be expected that after a period of hard struggle, the people in the disaster area here will surely victoriously conquer nature, heal the wounds of the earthquake disaster, and paint a newer and more beautiful picture on this land.

### 地震灾害压不倒英雄的人民

    地震灾害压不倒英雄的人民
    编者按：地震灾区广大人民，现在是怎样生活呢？怎样工作呢？这是广大读者十分关心的。我们在这篇报道当中，看到他们正在战斗，正在前进，正在“自力更生，奋发图强，发展生产，重建家园”。灾区充满着紧张而有秩序、镇定而又乐观的令人振奋的景象。
    毛泽东思想统帅一切。在激烈的斗争中，在艰苦的环境中，人们更深切地体会到毛泽东思想的巨大威力。强烈的地震是突然发生的，给灾区人民造成了很大的困难。怎样对待困难？怎样坚持斗争？怎样处理个人和集体的关系？怎样依靠优越的社会主义制度，自力更生，重建家园？一切的一切，都要按照毛泽东思想来思考、来行动。灾区广大干部群众这样做了，果然就在地震这个“怪物”面前取得了主动。“立下愚公移山志，双手重建新家园！”这就是结论。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力。地震灾区的人民，同日本帝国主义战斗过，同国民党反动派战斗过，同水灾旱灾等等自然灾害战斗过，都取得了伟大的胜利。现在，他们遇到了新的考验。依靠毛泽东思想的指引，依靠我们国家和各个兄弟地区的支援，他们已经取得了很大的胜利。我们相信，他们必将取得彻底的胜利，并在这场艰巨的斗争中，锻炼得更加坚强。
    三月八日，河北省邢台地区发生了一次强烈的地震。从那以后，在河北省的南部地区，又连续发生若干次地震，其中包括三月二十二日下午以邢台地区为中心，包括衡水、石家庄地区的两次强烈的地震。大地这样连续而频繁地颤动，随时可能给人们带来某种程度的损害。怎样来对待这种自然灾害，对地震灾区的人民群众是一个严峻的考验。
    这些日子里，本社记者在地震灾区亲眼目睹的许多事实表明，这里的人民群众用毛泽东思想武装了自己，胜利地经受了这个考验。地震所带来的灾害，把人们锻炼得坚强而镇定。许多干部和群众告诉记者，自从发生地震以来，党中央和毛主席以及全国人民、中国人民解放军，给了他们极大的支援和精神鼓励，给灾区群众增添了无穷的力量。他们说，地震虽然是他们遇到的一个新问题，但是只要有了毛泽东思想，有了无产阶级的硬骨头精神，地震是不可怕的，灾害是完全可以战胜的。
    “地动心不动，房倒志不倒”
    在几次强烈而且连续不断的地震面前，每个人都要碰到一个非常尖锐的问题，那就是地震来了，是惊慌失措，还是沉着镇定。记者进入地震灾区以来，愈来愈深刻地感觉到，这里的群众对于地震这个“怪物”，已开始摸到它的脾气，更有组织地进行斗争。
    在一条大河的两边堤岸上，我们看到人们用石灰和砖块砌成两行巨大的标语：“毛泽东思想是战胜地震灾害最有力的武器！”“地震灾害压不倒英雄的人民！”在一个几千人的群众大会上，我们看到一位县委书记举起拳头，领着人们高呼口号：“地动心不动，房倒志不倒！”有一个名叫解致善的共产党员对记者说：“地震不能把我们的思想震垮，它越震我们越要拿出革命精神来。对待困难只能战斗，不能低头！”这些充满着英雄气概的语言，在灾区到处可以听到。
    三月二十二日下午发生两次强烈地震的时候，记者正在地震区现场采访，有的在同社员谈话，有的在旁听救灾指挥部的会议。灾区的干部和群众当时那种镇定自若的无畏精神，给记者留下了极为深刻的印象。
    那天下午四点多钟，突然地动房摇，地层发出沉雷般的响声，有些村庄房屋倒塌，升起一片尘雾，有些田野里地下水带着泥沙冒出地面。这时，记者发现，人们已经不象八日清晨发生强烈地震以后那样惊异，而是秩序井然，临危不乱。由于这次地震前有的群众已经住进临时搭盖的窝棚，以及在地震发生时抢救工作做得好，因此虽然有些房屋倒塌，人畜伤亡较少，群众情绪安定。
    记者在灾区看到，地震过后，当地干部和群众立即兵分两路，一手抓救灾，一手抓生产。尽管以后的几天里余震还在继续，但是社员们照样扛着锄头下地，干部们照样开会布置工作，小学校照样开班上课。如果不是眼前那一片被震倒的断瓦颓垣，这里简直不象是一个遭受强烈地震的灾区。
    事实这样告诉我们：在地震来到以前，只要把人的住宿安排好，力争避免和减少生命和财产的损失，地震对人们也就没有什么了不起的威胁了。一个公社的党委书记任增山说得好：地震震不倒用毛泽东思想武装起来的人。房子倒了，地还在，人还在，有人就有一切。”受伤的贫农社员吕明喜的几句话更是充满了硬骨头精神。他说：“我的腿砸坏了，我还有一双手，我不能走，还能爬，爬着也要干！能添一砖是一砖，能添一瓦是一瓦，只要有口气，我就要斗到底！”
    “你震你的，我干我的！”记者在不止一个地方听到干部和群众不约而同地这样说。这句在灾区广为流传的豪言壮语，充分表现了英雄的人民沉着应战的革命精神。的确，对待地震只能采取这样的革命态度。难道可以在地震面前束手无策吗？
    “你震你的，我干我的！”这句话也确实反映了灾区人民在地震面前顽强战斗的英雄气概。老贫农李庆海和青年社员翟合均，二十二日发生强烈地震时正在田里打井，他们望见村里尘雾冲天，就跑回家去看看。进村一看，发现房屋虽倒，但没有伤人，便又立即赶回工地。当时他们心里想的是，这眼机井已经钻到十五丈深，如果放下不管，井身就有随时塌陷的危险，就会耽误今年的抗旱斗争。李庆海对翟合均说：“让它震去吧！再大的地震也震不倒咱们革命的心，闹革命就要有个坚决性！”在这以后，地震并没有完全停止，这位老贫农和翟合均一直在工地上坚持了三天三夜。在一个三月八日地震时曾经受到损失的生产大队里，贫协副主席贺全胜二十二日下午正在村里为社员安排重建房屋的事，突然大地晃荡起来，他站立不住，被倒下的砖墙压伤。住进“战地医院”后，他在昏迷中发出呓语，还念念不忘盖房的事。贺全胜在旧社会当过六年长工，父亲在一九四三年大旱时逃荒饿死。这位一向热爱集体的老贫农在病床上对记者说：“管它地震不地震，反正俺是要为人民服务的，俺一定要帮大伙把家园再建起来！”
    看到这些一身都是胆的英雄的人，听了这些响当当的英雄的话，记者深深地被他们那种革命精神所感动。一个毛泽东时代的人，应该用怎样一种精神状态来和地震灾害作斗争，这里的群众用他们的语言和行动，作出了最好的回答。
    “只要有准备，什么都不怕”
    这里的灾区人民不仅在大灾面前具有临危不惧的英雄胆略，而且为长期防灾救灾作了充分的准备。他们的工作做得那样细致，那样周密，他们的警惕性又是那样高。这使我们强烈地感到，地震锻炼了人民，使人民变得更加聪明了。
    三月二十二日发生强烈地震以后，记者赶到一个有三千二百多人口的重灾村庄，只见几百个临时垒起的锅灶，炊烟缭绕，村庄四周，搭起了几百座窝棚。社员们有的在修整农具，有的在培育红薯秧苗，有的在搬运砖木或清理房基，准备重建家园。在打谷场上，大队党支部正在召开党团员和贫农下中农代表会议，商讨自力更生、重建家园的大计。这里的生活充满了强烈的战斗气氛，许多工作都在齐头进行，但又忙而不乱。
    为什么在一场大地震以后，村庄里竟是这样秩序井然呢？原来，这个大队的党支部早在三月八日的地震以后，就根据县委的指示，充分发动群众，对防震和救灾工作作了周密的部署。抗日战争时期当过八路军侦察员的大队长张振华，在党支部会上坚定而有信心地说：“地震和打仗一样，就怕事先没有准备，只要有准备，什么都不怕。”在这以后，以党支部为核心的大队救灾指挥部成立了，党支部委员包片，党团员包户，发动群众的计划落实了，只两三天工夫，全村就在他们带领下搭起几百座临时窝棚，农具、粮食也都作了妥善安置。青年民兵再次学习了毛主席为人民服务的教导，争相报名给社员们站岗放哨，协同干部值班巡逻。因此，二十二日发生强烈地震时，全村人民沉着镇静，损失轻微。虽然房屋大部倒塌了，但灾后的生活、生产、建设等各项工作，都按预定计划顺利进行。
    类似这样的大队，在灾区远不止这一个。人们在同地震作斗争中取得一个又一个的胜利，正是他们接受毛主席关于在战略上要藐视敌人，在战术上要重视敌人的伟大教导的结果。可以毫不夸张地说，所有这一切，简直是人类历史上的一个奇迹。在所有历史资料中，有谁见过这样的记载：受灾的人民组织起来，没有悲观失望，而是信心百倍，斗志昂扬，用集体的智慧和力量同地震进行胜利的搏斗？
    在另一个生产大队，记者访问了六十二岁的老饲养员李仁堂。这个一九四四年入党的老党员，在八日地震后的一个深夜里，他坐在饲养室里琢磨着一个问题：过去打日本侵略军咱没有怕过，对地震更不能怕。要是再发生大地震，怎样才能尽快地把集体的牲口从棚里救出去呢？他琢磨了很久，突然想到：地震来得快，要救出牲口，慢腾腾地解开缰绳不行。他立即回家，取来一把菜刀和一把镰刀，磨得锋快，随时放在身边。二十二日第一次强烈地震一开始，他举起菜刀，一刹那就把拴牲口的缰绳一一砍断。八分钟后，当第二次强烈地震来临的时候，他已经把七头牲口赶出棚外。李仁堂这个胆大心细的人，为了集体想得这样周到，却把自己的安危完全置之度外。他磨的实际上不是菜刀、镰刀，而是向大自然开战的革命意志，是为人民服务的赤胆忠心！
    临危不惧，机智勇敢，是一种巨大的精神力量，有了这种精神力量，人们就能应付一切，战胜一切。在二十二日下午两次地震中间那短短八分钟的抢救战斗里，出现了许许多多舍身救人、先公后私的英雄事迹。这是战斗的八分钟，是考验人们意志的八分钟。有个被誉为“铁民兵”的民兵排，在地震发生时，个个冒着生命危险，逐户检查，从村里背出全部不能走动的老人和小孩，使全队没有一人伤亡。女社员赵培英在护送两位七十多岁的老人转移时，又发生强烈地震，刹时墙倒屋塌，赵培英不顾个人安危，将老人搂住躺下，用自己的身子将两位老人护住。小学教师傅廷印，地震时正在一间低矮的窝棚里上课，当棚顶被震塌的时候，他用肩膀顶住落下的屋梁，使三十多名学生免受损伤。正是这些勇敢的人，把地震的灾害减少到了最低的限度。
    地震可以造成人民生命财产的损失，但是在用毛泽东思想武装了头脑的人们面前，灾害是可以战胜的，损失是可以减少甚至避免的。在地震这个“怪物”面前，灾区人民用机智和勇敢进行了一场前所未闻的无畏的战斗。
    “自己能爬起来，就不靠人扶！”
    这些天来，一辆辆满载粮食、生活用品和建筑材料的汽车，从四面八方开到灾区，灾区人民在这最困难的时刻，得到了政府和全国人民巨大的支援。许多村庄的群众在接受各地运来的支援物资时，激动得热泪盈眶。受尽旧社会苦难的老贫农们说：“要是在旧社会遭这样的灾，就是砸不死，也要饿死！”“毛主席的心贴着俺们，有天大的困难，俺们也不怕！”
    但是，英雄的灾区人民是怎样看待国家和各地阶级兄弟对他们的支援呢？在很多村庄里，救灾部门把锅、碗、草席、木料发了下去，但过了几天，因为有些村庄尽量精打细算，节约国家的物资，有的自己有办法就尽量自己解决困难。这样，有些救灾物资又被退了回来，他们要求救灾部门把这些物资转运到困难多的地方去。有些生产大队在叫社员领取救灾物资的时候，社员们互相让来让去，使救灾物资的分配计划，一时难以落实下来。有一个生产大队把分到的七袋大饼转送给另一个生产大队，但是那个生产大队又把这七袋大饼转送到了又一个生产大队。难道这些地方的群众在大灾后根本没有困难吗？当然不是。这是自力更生的革命精神鼓起了灾区群众的斗志，他们是用一种完全崭新的思想和风格来迎接困难的。
    一个生产大队的民兵连提出一个行动口号：“伸手依赖救济，手会越来越长；自己动手干，越干越富强！”
    一个只有六十二户、二百一十四口人的生产大队，社员们喊出了更加响亮的战斗口号：“自己能爬起来，就不靠人扶！”地震的时候，这个大队的房屋全部倒塌了，全村社员在讨论时，提出“立下愚公移山志，双手重建新家园”的战斗口号，他们制定了一个建设社会主义新农村的蓝图，并且开始施工了。建房的砖和木料怎样解决？社员们分头从土里挖，现在已凑起五十六万块砖，四百多根梁和檩木，石灰是各户凑出来的，建房工具也自己解决，这样，修建一百三十间房屋的砖、料等物资就基本备齐。全队整半劳动力七十多个，分别投入了生产、建房两条战线。八九岁的孩子自动组织起来搬砖、运灰。年过七十的社员也主动找活干。
    看到这个村庄热火朝天的劳动情景，记者联想到一位公社党委书记所说的几句意味深长的话：“物质支援是有限的，双手的创造力是无限的，精神财富的威力更是无穷的。”
    有个八百二十多户的村庄，绝大部分房屋被震倒了。地震第二天国家送来了三百张席给社员搭窝棚。这一天，社员们在学习毛主席著作的讨论会上，热烈地议论起国家支援和自力更生的关系。贫农社员胡立生说：“毛主席派人给咱送来的，不光是三百张席，是给咱送来了斗天斗地的胆量。”贫农社员胡根朝说：“房倒人还在，我们不向国家要东西要钱，我们只要毛泽东思想。”讨论的结果，社员们从倒塌的房屋里挖出炕席和秫秸，搭起了九百多个席棚，把国家送来的三百张席留给队里盖牛棚，搭粮囤。社员们说：“摔倒了，自己爬起来，这才是好样的。我们决不给国家增加负担！”
    让我们再看看一位六十三岁的老贫农周皂林的革命志气吧！这位老人说：“我的大儿子是八路军战士，后来牺牲了。这次地震，砸死了我的四儿子。但是我还有两个儿子，两个媳妇，还有四个孙子。我叫儿子、儿媳、孙子都去地里劳动，生产可不能耽误，要不，今年吃救济粮，明年还得吃。在困难时候要往前看，咱得自力更生呀！”“自力更生！”“往前看！”这位普通的中国农民，有着多么远大而豪迈的志向啊！
    记者在灾区看到，许多参加救灾工作的干部在发放国家支援物资的同时，向灾区群众广泛宣传毛泽东思想，他们提出要把国家支援的物资和自力更生的思想一块儿发下去，要使物质变成激励人民斗志的革命精神。
    在自然灾害面前发扬自力更生的革命精神，在这个地区曾经有过成功的范例。邢台县西黄村公社南会大队一九六三年遭受特大洪水灾害时，房屋和庄稼大部分都被冲毁，但社员们仅仅用两年时间就盖起了两百多间新房，修好了四百多间旧房。粮食总产量去年比前年提高了一倍多，灾后第二年就实现粮食自给，还向国家交售了粮食。现在，这里的救灾指挥部门号召灾区群众开展一个“学南会”的运动。人们将会看到，南会精神将成为鼓舞灾区群众战胜地震灾害的一面大旗，并且将会有更多的“新南会”出现。
    “家里丢了地里找”
    记者在许多受灾的村庄里，看到灾后不多久生产活动便迅速恢复的令人振奋的景象。有的村庄房屋倒塌，人们只能在临时搭盖的窝棚里居住；有的社员由于亲人有伤亡而引起悲痛。但是，在这样严重灾害的打击下，人们并没有悲观失望，而是擦干了眼泪，医治了伤痕，很快就成群结队下地了。
    现在春耕大忙的时节已经迫近，田间活动显得非常繁忙。在一片片绿油油的麦田里，人们在锄地、浇水、追肥；在大块的经过翻耕的土地上，人们在赶着牛儿耙地；在村庄里，有的在修理农具，锯木声、打铁声响成一片；有的在选种育苗，准备春播。所有这些活动，在正常的年景毫不稀奇，但是只要想想这些活动是在一种什么样的环境和气氛下出现的，人们就不能不感到这里的人民在灾害面前是多么顽强。
    有一个社员曾经向上级派来的慰问人员说过这样一句话：“家里丢的，要从地里找回来！”他的意思是说，地震震倒了我们的房屋，砸伤了我们的亲人，我们绝不能向困难屈服，要更加顽强地去向大地作斗争，让它给我们多出粮食，补偿损失。这是一句多么好的充满着革命英雄主义的话！这句话现在已经传遍灾区，成为鼓舞群众加紧生产战胜地震灾害的一个响亮口号。
    在这样一场大的地震以后，可以想象，灾后的恢复工作真是头绪万端，百废待举。救灾指挥部最近讨论了怎样安排救灾工作，怎样抓住主要矛盾的问题。大家一致认为，越是灾害严重，越要鼓足干劲，搞好生产。要号召群众，紧紧依靠集体，用自己的双手，夺取今年农业丰收，这是战胜灾害的根本办法。这个方针正是对人民群众高度负责的精神的体现，是从国家、集体和人民的长远利益出发来考虑的。
    这样一个指导思想也正反映了灾区广大干部和群众的心愿。有一个公社的党委书记袁世申告诉记者，他们那里的社队干部和贫农下中农代表，在地震后曾经开会研究救灾工作，他们讨论了这样一个问题：发展生产和重建家园是个什么关系？经过讨论，大家一致认为：只有搞好了生产，才有力量重建家园。今年碰上“地震年”，但是一定要把它变成丰收年。会上决定，要组织百分之七十的劳动力下地生产，加强麦田管理，打响今年夏季丰收第一炮。记者在另一个生产队还听到队长解恒亮说过这样的话：“我们如果被地震吓住了，生产搞不好，秋后就要一灾变两灾。如果不怕它，它震它的，我干我的，秋后闹个大丰收，就不但不会一灾变两灾，还可以把这个地震灾补起来。”
    不少受灾的社队还认真分析了地震灾害所带来的后果，从不利条件中找有利因素，重新讨论了生产计划。大家认为，虽然地震带来了一些损失，但是，通过救灾，人们进一步掌握了毛泽东思想的武器，更看清楚了社会主义制度的优越性和集体力量的伟大威力，思想觉悟大大提高，闹生产的劲头更足了。有个大队在地震时，人和牲口都没有受到损失。这次讨论生产计划，决定把原计划的粮食亩产量再提高一百斤，棉花亩产量再提高二十斤。这个计划很快被群众接受。六十八岁的老社员宋洛铭说：“就是应该这样办，生产搞好了，什么都好解决。”
    人们的决心立即变成行动，一个向土地夺粮食争高产的战斗，现在已经在灾区普遍开始。有一个县去冬今春修起的几百条灌溉渠，这次地震时受到不同程度的破坏。而修渠引水改造旱地，是这个县今年夺取农业丰收的主要措施之一。地震后的第二天，县委就开会布置动员全县社员修复水渠。第三天，许多社队立即行动起来，他们只用三天时间，就把全县的渠道统统修好，现在已经开闸引水浇灌麦田了。
    “自力更生，奋发图强，发展生产，重建家园”这个口号，在灾区已经深入人心，并且正在化为千百万群众的行动，形成巨大的物质力量。可以预期，经过一个时期的艰苦奋斗，这里的灾区人民必将胜利地征服自然，医治好地震灾害的创伤，在这一片土地上描绘出更新更美的画图。
                                          新华社记者（附图片）
    地震灾区人民正以顽强斗争的精神，决心排除万难，争取今年农业丰收。这是石家庄地震区的社员们在锄麦。
