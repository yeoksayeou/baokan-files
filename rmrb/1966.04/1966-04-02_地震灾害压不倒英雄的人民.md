    Editor's Note: How are the broad masses of people in the earthquake-stricken areas living and working now? This is a matter of great concern to our readers. In this report, we see them fighting, advancing, and "relying on our own efforts, striving for progress, developing production, and rebuilding their homes." The disaster area is filled with an exciting scene of tension and order, calmness and optimism.

    Mao Zedong Thought commands everything. In the midst of fierce struggle and difficult circumstances, people have a deeper understanding of the enormous power of Mao Zedong Thought. The strong earthquake occurred suddenly, causing great difficulties for the people in the disaster area. How to deal with difficulties? How to persist in the struggle? How to handle the relationship between the individual and the collective? How to rely on the superior socialist system to rebuild our homes through self-reliance? Everything must be thought about and acted upon according to Mao Zedong Thought. The broad masses of cadres and people in the disaster area did this, and sure enough, they took the initiative in the face of the earthquake "monster". "Vow to have the determination of the Foolish Old Man who removed the mountains, and rebuild our new homes with our own hands!" This is the conclusion.

    People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest combat power. The people in the earthquake-stricken areas have fought against Japanese imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and natural disasters such as floods and droughts, and have achieved great victories. Now, they are facing a new test. Relying on the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the support of our country and various fraternal regions, they have already achieved great victories. We believe that they will achieve a complete victory and become even stronger in this arduous struggle.

    On March 8th, a strong earthquake occurred in the Xingtai area of Hebei Province. Since then, several more earthquakes have occurred in the southern part of Hebei Province, including two strong earthquakes centered in the Xingtai area and including the Hengshui and Shijiazhuang areas on the afternoon of March 22nd. The continuous and frequent shaking of the earth could bring some degree of damage to people at any time. How to deal with this natural disaster is a severe test for the people in the earthquake-stricken areas.

    In recent days, our correspondents have witnessed many facts in the earthquake-stricken areas, showing that the masses of people here have armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought and have successfully withstood this test. The disaster brought about by the earthquake has tempered people to be strong and calm. Many cadres and masses told reporters that since the earthquake, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, as well as the people of the whole country and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, have given them great support and spiritual encouragement, adding infinite strength to the masses in the disaster area. They said that although the earthquake is a new problem they have encountered, as long as they have Mao Zedong Thought and the hard-bone spirit of the proletariat, the earthquake is not to be feared, and the disaster can be completely overcome.

    "The earth moves, but our hearts do not; houses collapse, but our will does not."

    In the face of several strong and continuous earthquakes, everyone faces a very sharp question: when an earthquake comes, will you panic, or will you remain calm and composed? Since entering the earthquake-stricken area, our reporter has felt more and more deeply that the masses here have begun to grasp the temper of the earthquake "monster" and are fighting it in a more organized manner.

    On the banks of a large river, we saw people using lime and bricks to build two rows of huge slogans: "Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful weapon for overcoming earthquake disasters!" "Earthquake disasters cannot crush the heroic people!" At a mass meeting of several thousand people, we saw a county party secretary raise his fist and lead people in shouting slogans: "The earth moves, but our hearts do not; houses collapse, but our will does not!" A Communist Party member named Xie Zhishan told reporters: "The earthquake cannot crush our thinking; the more it shakes us, the more we must bring out our revolutionary spirit. We can only fight against difficulties; we cannot bow our heads!" These words, full of heroic spirit, can be heard everywhere in the disaster area.

    When two strong earthquakes occurred on the afternoon of March 22nd, our reporters were on the scene in the earthquake zone, some talking with commune members and others listening to meetings of the disaster relief headquarters. The calm and fearless spirit of the cadres and masses in the disaster area at that time left a very deep impression on the reporters.

    At a little after four o'clock that afternoon, the earth suddenly shook and houses swayed, and the earth's crust emitted a muffled thunder-like sound. Some village houses collapsed, raising a cloud of dust, and in some fields, groundwater with mud and sand gushed out of the ground. At this time, the reporter found that people were no longer as surprised as they were after the strong earthquake on the morning of the 8th, but were orderly and calm in the face of danger. Because some of the masses had already moved into temporary shelters before this earthquake, and because the rescue work was well done when the earthquake occurred, although some houses collapsed, there were fewer casualties to people and animals, and the masses were in a stable mood.

    The reporter saw in the disaster area that after the earthquake, local cadres and the masses immediately divided into two groups, one to grasp disaster relief and the other to grasp production. Despite the fact that aftershocks continued in the days that followed, commune members still went to the fields with hoes on their shoulders, cadres still held meetings to arrange work, and elementary schools still held classes. If it weren't for the collapsed rubble and broken walls in front of them, this would hardly seem like an earthquake-stricken area.

    The facts tell us that before the earthquake comes, as long as people's accommodation is arranged well and efforts are made to avoid and reduce the loss of life and property, the earthquake will not pose any great threat to people. Ren Zengshan, the party secretary of a commune, put it well: "An earthquake cannot shake down people who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought. If the house falls down, the land is still there, and the people are still there. If there are people, there is everything." The words of LÃ¼ Mingxi, a poor peasant commune member who was injured, were even more full of hard-bone spirit. He said: "My leg is broken, but I still have two hands. I can't walk, but I can still crawl. I will crawl and work! If I can add a brick, I will add a brick; if I can add a tile, I will add a tile. As long as I have breath, I will fight to the end!"

    "You shake yours, and I'll do mine!" Reporters heard cadres and masses say this in more than one place. This heroic saying, which is widely circulated in the disaster area, fully demonstrates the revolutionary spirit of the heroic people calmly responding to the challenge. Indeed, only such a revolutionary attitude can be adopted towards earthquakes. Can we stand idly by in the face of earthquakes?

    "You shake yours, and I'll do mine!" This sentence also truly reflects the heroic spirit of the people in the disaster area fighting tenaciously in the face of the earthquake. Old poor peasant Li Qinghai and young commune member Zhai Hejun were digging a well in the field when the strong earthquake occurred on the 22nd. They saw dust rising from the village and ran home to see what was happening. When they entered the village, they found that although the houses had collapsed, no one was injured, so they immediately rushed back to the construction site. At that time, what they had in mind was that this well had already been drilled to a depth of fifteen zhang, and if they left it unattended, the well shaft would be in danger of collapsing at any time, which would delay this year's struggle against drought. Li Qinghai said to Zhai Hejun: "Let it shake! No matter how big the earthquake, it can't shake our revolutionary hearts. To make revolution, you have to have decisiveness!" After that, the earthquake did not completely stop, but the old poor peasant and Zhai Hejun persisted at the construction site for three days and three nights. In a production brigade that had suffered losses in the March 8th earthquake, He Quansheng, the vice chairman of the poor peasants' association, was arranging for commune members to rebuild their houses in the village on the afternoon of the 22nd when the earth suddenly shook. He could not stand still and was injured by a collapsing brick wall. After being admitted to the "battlefield hospital," he uttered delirious words in his coma, still thinking about building houses. He Quansheng had worked as a hired farmhand for six years in the old society, and his father starved to death while fleeing the famine in the great drought of 1943. This old poor peasant, who has always loved the collective, said to reporters on his sickbed: "No matter what the earthquake does, I am going to serve the people anyway. I must help everyone rebuild their homes!"

    Seeing these heroic people, each of whom is full of courage, and hearing these resounding heroic words, the reporter was deeply moved by their revolutionary spirit. What kind of mental state should a person of the Mao Zedong era use to fight against earthquake disasters? The masses here have given the best answer with their words and actions.

    "As long as you are prepared, you are not afraid of anything."

    The people in the disaster area here not only have the heroic courage to be unafraid in the face of a major disaster, but also have made full preparations for long-term disaster prevention and relief. Their work is done so meticulously and so thoroughly, and their vigilance is so high. This makes us strongly feel that the earthquake has tempered the people and made them smarter.

    After the strong earthquake on March 22nd, the reporter rushed to a severely affected village with more than 3,200 people. We saw hundreds of temporary stoves, with smoke curling up from them. Around the village, hundreds of shacks had been set up. Some commune members were repairing farm tools, some were cultivating sweet potato seedlings, and some were moving bricks and wood or clearing house foundations in preparation for rebuilding their homes. On the threshing floor, the brigade party branch was holding a meeting of party members, League members, and representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants to discuss the great plan of self-reliance and rebuilding their homes. Life here is full of a strong fighting atmosphere. Many tasks are being carried out simultaneously, but they are busy without being chaotic.

    Why is the village so orderly after a major earthquake? It turns out that the party branch of this brigade, as early as after the March 8th earthquake, had fully mobilized the masses according to the instructions of the county party committee and made thorough arrangements for earthquake prevention and relief work. Zhang Zhenhua, the brigade leader who had served as a scout for the Eighth Route Army during the War of Resistance Against Japan, said firmly and confidently at the party branch meeting: "Earthquakes are like fighting a war. The only thing to fear is not being prepared beforehand. As long as you are prepared, you are not afraid of anything." After that, the brigade disaster relief headquarters, with the party branch as the core, was established. Party branch members were assigned to different areas, and party members and League members were assigned to different households. The plan to mobilize the masses was implemented, and in just two or three days, the entire village was led by them to set up hundreds of temporary shelters, and farm tools and grain were properly arranged. Young militiamen re-studied Chairman Mao's teachings on serving the people and eagerly signed up to stand guard for commune members, cooperate with cadres on duty and patrol. Therefore, when the strong earthquake occurred on the 22nd, the people of the whole village were calm and composed, and the losses were minor. Although most of the houses collapsed, the post-disaster life, production, construction, and other tasks were carried out smoothly according to plan.

    There are far more than just this one brigade like this in the disaster area. The victories that people have won in their struggle against earthquakes are precisely the result of their acceptance of Chairman Mao's great teaching that we should despise the enemy strategically and value the enemy tactically. It is no exaggeration to say that all of this is simply a miracle in human history. In all historical records, who has ever seen such a record: the people who have suffered disaster are organized, without being pessimistic and disappointed, but with a hundredfold confidence and high morale, using collective wisdom and strength to carry out a victorious struggle against the earthquake?

    In another production brigade, the reporter visited Li Rentang, a 62-year-old old feeder. This old party member, who joined the party in 1944, was sitting in the feeding room late one night after the earthquake on the 8th, pondering a question: We were not afraid of fighting the Japanese invaders in the past, and we should not be afraid of earthquakes even more. If another major earthquake occurs, how can we get the collective livestock out of the shed as quickly as possible? He pondered for a long time and suddenly thought: Earthquakes come quickly. To rescue the livestock, it is no good to slowly untie the reins. He immediately went home, took a kitchen knife and a sickle, sharpened them quickly, and kept them by his side at all times. As soon as the first strong earthquake on the 22nd began, he raised his kitchen knife and cut off the reins tying the livestock one by one in an instant. Eight minutes later, when the second strong earthquake came, he had already driven seven head of livestock out of the shed. Li Rentang, this bold and careful man, thought so thoroughly for the collective, but completely disregarded his own safety. What he sharpened was not actually a kitchen knife or a sickle, but the revolutionary will to wage war against nature, and the red heart and loyalty to serve the people!

    Being calm in the face of danger and being resourceful and brave is a huge spiritual force. With this spiritual force, people can cope with everything and overcome everything. In the short eight minutes of rescue combat between the two earthquakes on the afternoon of the 22nd, many heroic deeds of sacrificing oneself to save others and putting the public before the private emerged. These were eight minutes of combat, eight minutes of testing people's will. A militia platoon, known as the "Iron Militia," risked their lives to check every household and carry out all the old and children who could not walk from the village, so that no one in the entire team was injured or killed. Female commune member Zhao Peiying was escorting two elderly people in their 70s when another strong earthquake occurred. In an instant, walls collapsed and houses collapsed. Zhao Peiying, regardless of her personal safety, hugged the elderly and lay down, using her body to protect the two elderly people. Elementary school teacher Fu Tingyin was teaching in a low shack when the earthquake occurred. When the roof of the shack collapsed, he used his shoulders to prop up the falling roof beams, preventing more than 30 students from being injured. It was these brave people who reduced the damage from the earthquake to the lowest limit.

    Earthquakes can cause losses to people's lives and property, but in the face of people who have armed their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, disasters can be overcome and losses can be reduced or even avoided. In the face of the earthquake "monster," the people in the disaster area waged an unprecedented and fearless battle with ingenuity and courage.

    "If you can get up on your own, don't rely on others to help you!"

    In recent days, cars loaded with grain, daily necessities, and building materials have driven to the disaster area from all directions. The people in the disaster area have received enormous support from the government and the people of the whole country at this most difficult moment. The masses in many villages were moved to tears when they received the relief supplies from all over the country. The old poor peasants who had suffered in the old society said: "If we had encountered such a disaster in the old society, even if we weren't crushed to death, we would have starved to death!" "Chairman Mao's heart is close to us. No matter how great the difficulties, we are not afraid!"

    However, how do the heroic people in the disaster area view the support from the state and fraternal regions? In many villages, the disaster relief departments distributed pots, bowls, straw mats, and wood, but after a few days, because some villages tried their best to be careful and thrifty and save state resources, some villages tried their best to solve their own difficulties if they had a way to do so. As a result, some relief supplies were returned, and they asked the disaster relief departments to transfer these supplies to places with more difficulties. When some production brigades asked commune members to collect relief supplies, the commune members yielded to each other, making it difficult to implement the relief supply distribution plan for a while. One production brigade transferred the seven bags of large cakes they received to another production brigade, but that production brigade transferred the seven bags of large cakes to yet another production brigade. Are the masses in these places really not experiencing any difficulties after the major disaster? Of course not. It is the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance that has inspired the fighting spirit of the masses in the disaster area. They are using a completely new ideology and style to meet the difficulties.

    The militia company of one production brigade put forward a slogan of action: "If you rely on relief by reaching out, your hands will become longer and longer; if you do it yourself, the more you do, the richer you will become!"

    In a production brigade with only 62 households and 214 people, the commune members shouted an even louder battle cry: "If you can get up on your own, don't rely on others to help you!" When the earthquake occurred, all the houses in this brigade collapsed. When the commune members discussed it, they put forward the battle cry of "Vow to have the determination of the Foolish Old Man who removed the mountains, and rebuild our new homes with our own hands!" They formulated a blueprint for building a new socialist countryside and began construction. How to solve the problem of bricks and wood for building houses? The commune members went separately to dig them out of the soil. They have now collected 560,000 bricks, more than 400 beams and purlins. The lime was collected by each household, and the building tools were also solved by themselves. In this way, the bricks, materials, and other supplies for building 130 houses are basically ready. More than 70 semi-able-bodied laborers in the entire team were put into the two battle lines of production and house building. Children of eight or nine years old automatically organized themselves to move bricks and transport ash. Commune members over the age of 70 also took the initiative to find work to do.

    Seeing the hot labor scene in this village, the reporter was reminded of a few meaningful words said by a commune party committee secretary: "Material support is limited, the creative power of hands is unlimited, and the power of spiritual wealth is even more infinite."

    In a village with more than 820 households, most of the houses were knocked down by the earthquake. The next day after the earthquake, the state sent 300 mats for the commune members to build shacks. On this day, at a discussion meeting to study Chairman Mao's writings, the commune members enthusiastically discussed the relationship between state support and self-reliance. Poor peasant commune member Hu Lisheng said: "What Chairman Mao sent people to give us is not just 300 mats, but the courage to fight against heaven and earth." Poor peasant commune member Hu Genchao said: "If the house collapses, the people are still there. We don't want things or money from the state; we just want Mao Zedong Thought." As a result of the discussion, the commune members dug up kang mats and sorghum stalks from the collapsed houses and built more than 900 mat sheds, leaving the 300 mats sent by the state to the team to build cowsheds and grain barns. The commune members said: "If you fall, get up on your own. That's what a good person should do. We will never increase the burden on the state!"

    Let us take a look at the revolutionary ambition of Zhou Zaolin, a 63-year-old old poor peasant! The old man said: "My eldest son was an Eighth Route Army soldier and later died. This earthquake killed my fourth son. But I still have two sons, two daughters-in-law, and four grandchildren. I will tell my sons, daughters-in-law, and grandchildren to go to the fields to work. Production cannot be delayed. Otherwise, we will eat relief grain this year, and we will have to eat it next year. In times of difficulty, we must look forward. We must rely on our own efforts!" "Self-reliance!" "Look forward!" What a grand and ambitious vision this ordinary Chinese peasant has!

    The reporter saw in the disaster area that many cadres who participated in the disaster relief work widely publicized Mao Zedong Thought to the masses in the disaster area while distributing the state's support materials. They proposed to distribute the state's support materials and the idea of self-reliance together, so that materials can be transformed into the revolutionary spirit that inspires the people's fighting spirit.

    In this area, there has been a successful example of developing the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance in the face of natural disasters. When the Nanhui Brigade of the Xihuangcun Commune in Xingtai County suffered a major flood disaster in 1963, most of the houses and crops were destroyed, but the commune members built more than 200 new houses and repaired more than 400 old houses in just two years. The total grain output last year increased by more than double compared to the previous year, and they achieved grain self-sufficiency in the second year after the disaster, and also sold grain to the state. Now, the disaster relief headquarters here is calling on the masses in the disaster area to launch a "learn from Nanhui" movement. People will see that the Nanhui spirit will become a banner to encourage the masses in the disaster area to overcome the earthquake disaster, and there will be more "new Nanhui" emerging.

    "Find what you lost at home in the fields"

    The reporter saw in many disaster-stricken villages the inspiring scene of production activities being quickly restored not long after the disaster. In some villages, houses have collapsed, and people can only live in temporary shacks; some commune members are saddened by the injuries or deaths of their loved ones. However, under the impact of such a severe disaster, people have not been pessimistic and disappointed, but have wiped away their tears, healed their wounds, and quickly went to the fields in groups.

    Now the busy season of spring plowing is approaching, and field activities seem very busy. In the green wheat fields, people are hoeing, watering, and topdressing; on large tracts of plowed land, people are driving cattle to harrow the land; in the villages, some are repairing farm tools, and the sound of sawing wood and forging iron can be heard everywhere; some are selecting seeds and raising seedlings, preparing for spring planting. All these activities are not surprising in normal years, but as long as you think about what kind of environment and atmosphere these activities are taking place in, people cannot help but feel how tenacious the people here are in the face of disaster.

    A commune member once said to the visiting personnel sent by the higher authorities: "What we lost at home, we must find it back in the fields!" What he meant was that the earthquake knocked down our houses and injured our loved ones, but we must never succumb to difficulties, but must fight the earth even more tenaciously, so that it will give us more food and compensate for the losses. What a wonderful statement full of revolutionary heroism! This sentence has now spread throughout the disaster area and has become a resounding slogan to encourage the masses to step up production and overcome the earthquake disaster.

    After such a major earthquake, one can imagine that the post-disaster recovery work is really complicated and everything needs to be done. The disaster relief headquarters recently discussed how to arrange disaster relief work and how to grasp the main contradictions. Everyone unanimously agreed that the more severe the disaster, the more efforts must be made to do a good job in production. We must call on the masses to rely closely on the collective and use their own hands to win a bumper agricultural harvest this year. This is the fundamental way to overcome the disaster. This policy is a reflection of the spirit of being highly responsible to the people and is based on the long-term interests of the state, the collective, and the people.

    Such a guiding ideology also reflects the wishes of the broad masses of cadres and people in the disaster area. Yuan Shishen, the party secretary of a commune, told reporters that the commune and brigade cadres and representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants there had held a meeting after the earthquake to study the disaster relief work. They discussed the relationship between developing production and rebuilding their homes. After discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that only by doing a good job in production can we have the strength to rebuild our homes. This year, we have encountered an "earthquake year," but we must turn it into a bumper harvest year. The meeting decided to organize 70% of the labor force to go to the fields to produce, strengthen wheat field management, and fire the first shot for a bumper summer harvest this year. The reporter also heard the captain Jie Hengliang say in another production team: "If we are frightened by the earthquake and production is not good, then after the autumn, one disaster will become two disasters. If we are not afraid of it, and it shakes its, and I do mine, and we have a bumper harvest in the autumn, then not only will one disaster not become two disasters, but we can also make up for this earthquake disaster."

    Many disaster-stricken communes and brigades have also seriously analyzed the consequences of the earthquake disaster, looked for favorable factors from unfavorable conditions, and re-discussed production plans. Everyone believes that although the earthquake has brought some losses, through disaster relief, people have further mastered the weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, have seen more clearly the superiority of the socialist system and the great power of the collective, their ideological awareness has been greatly improved, and their enthusiasm for production is even greater. One brigade suffered no losses to people or livestock during the earthquake. This time, when discussing the production plan, it was decided to increase the planned grain yield per mu by another 100 jin and the cotton yield per mu by another 20 jin. This plan was quickly accepted by the masses. Song Luoming, a 68-year-old commune member, said: "That's how it should be done. If production is good, everything will be easy to solve."

    People's determination immediately turned into action. A battle to seize grain from the land and strive for high yields has now begun universally in the disaster area. Several hundred irrigation canals built by a county last winter and this spring were damaged to varying degrees in this earthquake. And repairing canals to divert water and transform dry land is one of the main measures this county will take this year to win a bumper agricultural harvest. The day after the earthquake, the county party committee held a meeting to deploy and mobilize all the commune members in the county to repair the canals. On the third day, many communes and brigades immediately took action. They spent only three days to repair all the canals in the county, and now they have opened the gates to divert water to irrigate the wheat fields.

    "Self-reliance, striving for progress, developing production, and rebuilding our homes" This slogan has taken root in the hearts of the people in the disaster area and is being transformed into the actions of millions of people, forming a huge material force. It can be expected that after a period of hard struggle, the people in the disaster area here will surely victoriously conquer nature, heal the wounds of the earthquake disaster, and paint a newer and more beautiful picture on this land.
