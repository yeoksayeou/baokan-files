　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 27th: The full text of Chairman Ho Chi Minh's speech at the last session of the Third National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam:

Comrade National Assembly Delegates,

　　Our National Assembly meeting is being held at a time when our entire nation's resistance war against American aggression and for national salvation is becoming increasingly fierce, and we are achieving many glorious victories.

　　The American bandits, due to their major defeats in South Vietnam, have risked throwing 250,000 American expeditionary troops and accomplice troops into this battlefield, and are frantically intensifying their war of aggression along with the puppet army. They have launched large-scale "sweeps." They are "burning all, killing all, destroying all" everywhere. They are using napalm bombs, poison gas, and chemical toxins to kill our compatriots and destroy our villages. They vainly attempt to rely on the brutal force of weapons to make our Southern compatriots submit. But the heroic Southern compatriots have not wavered in the slightest, and will never waver! Like adding fuel to the fire, the extremely barbaric crimes of the American bandits and their running dogs will only arouse greater anger among our people nationwide. The Southern army and people, carrying forward their spirit of extraordinary heroism and their determination to kill the enemy and save the nation, are continuously advancing bravely, continuously attacking the enemy on all battlefields, eliminating tens of thousands of American troops, and eliminating and disintegrating hundreds of thousands of puppet troops. Our compatriots in the cities of the South are also rising up and carrying out vigorous struggles. The remarkable achievements and great victories of the Southern army and people are making our compatriots across the country jubilant and our friends across the five continents elated.

　　I propose that our National Assembly enthusiastically applaud the heroic Southern soldiers and compatriots!

　　Due to being increasingly bogged down and in a passive position, and in order to extricate itself from this predicament, American imperialism has risked expanding the destructive war against the North with its air force. For more than a year, it has dispatched hundreds of aircraft every day to continuously attack our North. It also vainly hopes that its bombs will be able to shake the determination of our people. However, the soldiers and compatriots of our North have conducted an incomparably heroic struggle. To date, 973 American aircraft have been shot down, and a group of American bandit pilots have been captured alive.

　　For the sake of our beloved motherland, for the sake of our Southern brothers and sisters, for the sake of socialism, the army and people of our North have carried forward a high degree of fighting spirit and displayed extremely strong combat power. Striving to produce on the one hand and preparing to fight at any time on the other, our compatriots and soldiers have all shown unparalleled heroism. The revolutionary momentum is rising day by day, and the competition movement is developing vigorously. From the elderly to the children, especially the youth, regardless of gender, everyone is enthusiastically competing to contribute to the cause of resisting American aggression and saving the nation.

　　I propose that our National Assembly enthusiastically applaud the great achievements made by the army and people of our North in combat and production!

　　Dear Comrades, we have already achieved brilliant victories, but these are only preliminary victories. The American aggressor bandits and the Vietnamese traitorous clique have not been completely defeated, and they will still employ many insidious and malicious schemes. The more barbaric crimes their hands commit, the more their mouths will shout about "peace" and "negotiations." Although the resistance war is still long and arduous, our people are determined to carry the resistance war through to final victory. Our people deeply love peace, but there can only be genuine peace with genuine independence and freedom. Our Vietnamese nation is a heroic nation, and we are determined to fight resolutely to the end for genuine peace, independence, and freedom until complete victory.

　　The army and people of our North have made many efforts, and must further strive, resolutely advance, launch production competitions, launch competitions to kill the enemy, and promote the cause of resisting American aggression and saving the nation; strengthen the people's air defense work; we must militarize in work and life. We must vigorously defend and build a solid North, wholeheartedly support the liberation cause of the South, and fulfill the task of the great rear area to the great front.

　　Under the wise leadership of the National Liberation Front, from the countryside to the cities, from the mountains to the plains, our Southern compatriots are strengthening unity, fighting resolutely, advancing bravely, liberating the South, contributing to the defense of the North, and then peacefully unifying the motherland.

　　Our people bear the great responsibility and honor of standing on the front line of the world's people against American imperialist aggression. For the sake of the independence and unity of our motherland, for the sake of the security of the socialist camp, for the sake of the revolutionary cause of the world's people and the defense of peace, our people nationwide, united as one, will resolutely complete the arduous and incomparably glorious task of defeating the American aggressor bandits.

　　The people of the socialist brother countries and the progressive people of the world are watching our great resistance war with respect every day, and are increasingly actively supporting our people in fighting and defeating the enemy. In order to repay this noble internationalist friendship, our people must further carry forward the revolutionary spirit, advance cheerfully, and be determined to strive for complete victory.

　　On this occasion, on behalf of the people of our country, our National Assembly, our government, and the Vietnam Workers' Party, I would like to once again express my heartfelt gratitude to the socialist brother countries and the progressive people of the world who warmly support and help our people's cause of resisting American aggression and saving the nation. I also welcome the progressive American people who are bravely opposing the US government's crime-ridden war of aggression against Vietnam.

　　In order to end this war, the only correct solution has already been clarified in my letters to the heads of government of many countries. This only correct solution has also been clarified in the five-point statement of the National Liberation Front, the only true representative of the people of South Vietnam.

　　We once again say to President Johnson: If the United States truly wants peace, then it must completely withdraw the troops of the United States and its vassal states, and stop the war of aggression against South Vietnam;

　　It must immediately and unconditionally stop the destructive war against the North;

　　The issue of Vietnam's unification should be resolved entirely by the Vietnamese people themselves in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords, without foreign interference.

　　Justice belongs to our people.

　　The Vietnamese people will surely win, and American imperialism will surely be defeated!

　　Compatriots and soldiers across the country, advance bravely!

　　Be determined to defeat the American aggressor bandits!

    越南人民决心抗战到最后胜利
    美国侵略强盗越是犯下野蛮罪行就越要叫嚷“和平”“谈判”
    新华社河内二十七日电　胡志明主席在越南民主共和国第三届国会第三次会议最后一次会议上的讲话。全文如下：国会代表同志们，
    我们的这次国会会议是在我们全国人民的抗美救国抗战愈来愈激烈、我们正在取得许多辉煌胜利的时候召开的。
    美国强盗由于在我国南方遭到大败，竟然冒险地向这个战场投入了二十五万名美国远征军和帮凶军，同伪军一起疯狂地加强侵略战争。它们发动了大规模的“扫荡”。它们到处“烧光、杀光、毁光”。它们使用凝固汽油弹、毒气和化学毒药杀害我国同胞，破坏我们的村庄。它们妄图依靠武器的残暴力量就可以使我们南方同胞屈服。但是英雄的南方同胞丝毫没有动摇，而且永远也不会动摇！正如火上加油一样，美国强盗及其走狗的极端野蛮的罪行，只会激起我们全国人民更大的愤怒。南方军民发扬英勇卓绝的精神和坚决杀敌救国的意志，不断地英勇前进，在所有战场上连续地进攻敌人，消灭了数以万计的美军，消灭和瓦解了数以十万计的伪军。我们南方各城市同胞也正在起来进行着声势浩大的斗争。南方军民的显赫战功和伟大胜利，正使得我们全国同胞欢欣鼓舞，使得我们遍及五大洲的朋友兴高采烈。
    我建议我们的国会为英雄的南方战士和同胞热烈欢呼！
    美帝国主义由于日益深陷泥沼和处于被动，并为了摆脱这种困境，它冒险地用空军扩大对北方进行破坏性战争。一年多来，它每天出动了成百架飞机连续袭击我国北方。它还妄想用它们的炸弹就能够动摇我国人民的决心。但是，我国北方的战士和同胞进行了无比英勇的战斗。至今，已有九百七十三架美国飞机被击落，一批美国强盗飞行员被活俘。
    为了亲爱的祖国，为了骨肉的南方，为了社会主义，我国北方军民发扬了高度的战斗精神，发挥了极强的战斗威力。一面努力生产、一面随时准备战斗，我国的同胞和战士都表现得无比英雄。革命气势日益高涨，竞赛运动日益蓬勃发展。从老人到儿童，特别是青年们，不分男女，人人都踊跃竞赛，为抗美救国事业作出贡献。
    我建议我们的国会为我国北方军民在战斗和生产中所取得的巨大成绩热烈欢呼！
    亲爱的同志们，我们已经取得辉煌的胜利，但这仅仅是初步的胜利。美国侵略强盗和越奸卖国集团还没有彻底失败，它们还会施展出许多阴险毒辣的阴谋，它们的手越是犯下野蛮罪行，它们的嘴就越要叫嚷“和平”、“谈判”。虽然抗战还长期和艰苦，但是我国人民决心把抗战进行到最后胜利。我国人民非常热爱和平，但必须要有真正的独立和自由，才有真正的和平。我们越南民族是一个英雄的民族，我们决心为争取真正的和平、独立和自由而坚决战斗到彻底胜利。
    我国北方军民作出不少的努力，还必须进一步努力，坚决前进，开展生产竞赛，杀敌竞赛，促进抗美救国事业；加强人民防空工作；我们必须要在工作和生活中军事化。我们必须大力保卫和建设稳固的北方，全心全力支持南方的解放事业，完成大后方对大前线的任务。
    在民族解放阵线的英明领导下，从农村到城市，从山区到平原的我国南方同胞，正在加强团结，坚决战斗，勇敢前进，解放南方，为保卫北方，进而和平统一祖国作出贡献。
    我国人民有着站在世界人民反对美帝国主义侵略前线的重大责任和荣誉。为了我们祖国的独立和统一，为了社会主义阵营的安全，为了世界人民的革命事业和保卫和平，我们全国人民团结一致，坚决完成打败美国侵略强盗的繁重而又无比光荣的任务。
    社会主义兄弟国家人民和全世界进步人民怀着敬爱的心情，每天都注视着我们的伟大抗战，并且日益积极地支援我国人民战斗和战胜敌人。为了报答这一高贵的国际主义情义，我国人民必须进一步发扬革命气概，愉快前进，决心争取彻底胜利。
    趁此机会，我谨代表我国人民、我国国会、我国政府和越南劳动党，再一次向热情支持和帮助我国人民抗美救国事业的社会主义兄弟国家和全世界进步人民表示衷心的感谢。我也向正在勇敢反对美国政府对越南进行罪恶满盈的侵略战争的美国进步人民表示欢迎。
    为了结束这场战争，唯一正确的解决办法已经在我给许多国家政府首脑的信件中阐明。这一唯一正确的解决办法，也在越南南方人民的唯一真正代表——民族解放阵线的五点声明中得到阐明。
    我们再一次向约翰逊总统说：如果美国真正希望和平，那末就必须全部撤走美国和仆从国的军队，停止对越南南方的侵略战争；
    必须立即无条件地停止对北方的破坏性战争；
    越南的统一问题，要按照日内瓦协议的规定，完全由越南人民自己解决，不许外国干涉。
    正义属于我国人民。
    越南人民必胜，美帝国主义必败！
    全国同胞和战士们英勇前进！
    决心战胜美国侵略强盗！
