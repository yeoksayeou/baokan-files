    Persist in Holding Good Organizational Life Meetings
    Guo Gengshen, Party Branch Secretary of Zhouzhuang Brigade, Xindian Commune, Yancheng, Henan

    Our Zhouzhuang Brigade Party Branch was established in 1954. At that time, there were only four Party members, and a branch was established together with Wuwan. With few Party members and scattered residences, organizational life was not sustained well enough. Since 1960, through the socialist education movement, it was determined that the groups would meet twice a month, and the branch would meet once a month, so that Party members could frequently participate in organizational life. This system has been maintained ever since. Initially, due to lack of experience, the meetings were not lively enough, and the effect was not great. Later, with the help of the commune Party committee, methods were adopted such as preparing before the meeting, focusing on specific issues during the meeting, and focusing on resolving one issue per person, which produced better results.

    In the past few years, how has our Party branch insisted on organizational life meetings? The main experiences are as follows:

    Prepare well before the meeting and solve problems with a clear aim. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us that we should not fight unprepared battles. This is absolutely true. Whatever we do, if we want to do it well, we must have a clear understanding of the situation, a strong determination, and a clear aim. The branch's organizational life meeting should be prepared for. In addition to paying attention to the ideological changes of Party members in ordinary times, the branch regularly holds symposiums of poor peasant association representatives every month, soliciting their opinions on Party members and the branch, and then, according to the situation, determines the content of each organizational life meeting and the main issues that need to be resolved, and informs Party members in advance to prepare well. For example, Meng Guangtai, the militia battalion commander, and Lu Shunyu, the deputy branch secretary, had disagreements with each other and were not united. After the branch discovered this situation, it immediately went down to understand the reasons for their estrangement and convened an organizational life meeting the next day, and notified them in advance. At the meeting, they first studied the Party's relevant documents on unity and a section of Mao Zedong's "On Coalition Government" entitled "Unite the Whole Party and Fight to Realize the Party's Tasks." Through study and connection with their thoughts, everyone further clarified the necessity of unity within the Party and the harm that disunity would cause to the revolutionary cause. Lu Shunyu and Meng Guangtai both made self-criticisms. In this way, both sides examined their mistakes and eliminated their estrangement. Other Party members who were not united also met each other ideologically, thereby achieving new unity on a new basis.

    Branch backbones take the lead, humbly listen to opinions and accept criticism. "The village looks at the village, the household looks at the household, the masses look at the cadres, the cadres look at the Party members, and the Party members look at the branch secretary." The branch secretary paid attention to promoting democracy, seriously examined his own shortcomings, and humbly listened to and accepted the criticisms of Party members; this not only made it easier to overcome the shortcomings of the branch committee members, but also motivated Party members to conscientiously carry out criticism and self-criticism. Last August, our brigade added three new villages. I thought that the setup was too big, there were too many problems, and there were many difficulties. I was afraid that I would not be able to do it well, and I once had negative emotions. Later, at the organizational life meeting, I took the lead in examining my own wrong thoughts. After the meeting, I convened a meeting of production team leaders from the three newly added villages and arranged the work. Under my influence, other Party member cadres also consciously conducted self-examinations. Party member team leader Li Shaozeng also examined his wrong thoughts of fearing difficulties, fearing offending people, and fearing losses when being a cadre. At the meeting, everyone expressed that they would resolutely listen to the Party's words, learn from Lei Feng and Wang Jie, and learn from their revolutionary spirit of not fearing hardship or death, and strive to do a good job.

    Adhere to the system and supervise each other. The organizational life meeting system is easy to establish but difficult to maintain. The branch holds a life meeting once a month as required. This system can be maintained at ordinary times, but when encountering busy seasons, wind and rain, or dark nights, there are divergent opinions. Some people say: "It is better to hold meetings in the slack season, but not in the busy season. Production is busy, there is no time, and no one will bother with that effort." Once, when it was time to hold a life meeting, it was not held during the day. It rained at night, and the sky was dark and the road was slippery. Branch committee member and brigade leader Li Shaozeng said: "It is raining, the sky is dark and the road is slippery, and the people will not be all there. It is better not to hold it at all or hold it during the day the next day." At this time, I thought that tomorrow has tomorrow's work, and if one day's work is not completed, it will be delayed, and the work will be very passive. Moreover, the system was formulated by everyone, and if the leaders take the lead in not implementing it, how can they educate everyone? In the end, the meeting was still convened according to the original regulations.

    Because our Party branch can adhere to the Party's organizational life meeting system, promote inner-Party democracy, and frequently carry out criticism and self-criticism, the combat effectiveness of the Party branch has been strengthened, and the exemplary leading role of Party members in various tasks has also been better played.

    坚持开好组织生活会
    河南郾城新店公社周庄大队党支部书记　郭庚申
    我们周庄大队党支部是一九五四年建立的。当时只有四名党员，同吴湾一起建立了一个支部。党员少，居住分散，组织生活坚持的不够好。一九六○年以来，经过社会主义教育运动，确定了小组每月开会两次，支部每月开会一次，使党员经常过组织生活。这个制度，一直坚持下来。起初由于没有经验，会开得不够活跃，收效也不大。后来在公社党委的帮助下，采取了会前有准备，会上有的放矢和重点解决一人一事的方法，效果较好。
    几年来，我们党支部是怎样坚持组织生活会议的呢？主要体会有以下三点：
    会前作好准备，有的放矢地解决问题。毛泽东同志教导我们说，不打无准备的仗。这话是千真万确的。我们无论办什么事情，要想办好，必须情况明，决心大，有的放矢。支部的组织生活会，应当是有准备的。支部除平时注意掌握党员的思想变化外，每月定期召开贫协代表座谈会，征求他们对党员和支部的意见，然后，根据情况，确定每次组织生活会的内容和需要解决的主要问题，事先告诉党员作好准备。如民兵营长孟广太与副支部书记卢顺宇两人相互有意见，不团结。支部发觉这种情况后，随即下去了解他俩产生隔阂的原因，第二天就召开组织生活会，并事先通知了他们。会上，首先学习了党内有关团结的文件和毛泽东同志《论联合政府》中《全党团结起来，为实现党的任务而斗争》的一节。通过学习，联系思想，大家进一步明确了党内团结的必要和不团结对革命事业的危害。卢顺宇和孟广太都作了自我批评。这样，双方检查了错误，消除了隔阂。其他党员有不团结的，也都互相在思想上见了面，从而在新的基础上，达到了新的团结。
    支部骨干带头，虚心听取意见和接受批评。“村看村，户看户，群众看的是干部，干部看党员，党员看支书。”支部书记注意了发扬民主，认真检查自己的缺点，虚心听取和接受党员的批评；这不仅使支部委员的缺点容易得到克服，而且也带动了党员认真开展批评与自我批评。去年八月，我们大队新增加了三个村，我认为摊子大，问题多，困难多，怕搞不好，曾一度产生消极情绪。后来，在组织生活会上，我首先带头检查了自己的错误思想，会后就召开新增加三个村的生产队长会议，布置了工作。在自己的影响下，其他党员干部也都自觉地作了检查，党员队长李绍曾也检查了怕困难、怕得罪人、怕当干部吃亏的错误思想。会上大家都表示要坚决听党的话，要学习雷锋、王杰，学习他们不怕苦、不怕死的革命精神，努力做好工作。
    坚持制度，相互监督。组织生活会议制度，建立容易坚持难。支部按规定每月召开一次生活会。平时这个制度都能坚持，但是一遇到大忙季节、刮风下雨或黑夜，就有分歧的意见。有的说：“农闲时期召开好，农忙时期不要开，生产忙，没时间，谁也不搭那个功夫。”有一次该开生活会，白天没有开，晚上下了雨，天黑路滑，支部委员、大队长李绍曾说：“下着雨，天黑路又滑，人到不齐，不如干脆不开或者第二天白天开。”这时我想，明天有明天的工作，一天的工作不完成都要往后拖，工作就会很被动。况且制度是大家订的，领导带头不执行，怎样能教育大家。最后，会议还是按原来规定召开了。
    由于我们党支部能够坚持党的组织生活会议制度，发扬党内民主，经常开展批评与自我批评，所以党支部的战斗力加强了，党员在各项工作中的模范带头作用发挥得也比较好。
