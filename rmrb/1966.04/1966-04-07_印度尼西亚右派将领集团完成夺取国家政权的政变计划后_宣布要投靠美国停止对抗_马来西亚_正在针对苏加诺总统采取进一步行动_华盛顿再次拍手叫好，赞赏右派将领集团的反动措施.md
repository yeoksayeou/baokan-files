    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 6th - News: After completing a coup plan to seize state power, the Indonesian right-wing generals group is taking further actions against President Sukarno.
    News from Jakarta indicates that the right-wing generals group is clearly not satisfied with the current situation. On March 31, a demonstration by students belonging to the right-wing "Indonesian University Students United Action Organization" took place again in Jakarta, demanding that the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly set a term limit for President Sukarno and strip him of his title of "President for Life." The students demanded compliance with the 1945 Indonesian Constitution, which stipulates that the President's term is five years and provides for a Vice President as the legal successor to the President.
    Subsequently, Suharto said on the 2nd that "in order to ensure the smooth operation of the cabinet," "the opinions and demands of the people should be expressed through the Cooperative Parliament and the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly." On the 5th, he said even more bluntly that "the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly holds the highest power, and the President is merely an official who implements the national policies decided by the Consultative Assembly." President Sukarno "is subordinate to the Consultative Assembly," and "the President is not a dictator and does not possess unlimited power."
    Nasution also spoke on the 5th, advocating for "the immediate purge and improvement of the Cooperative Parliament and the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly in order to hold meetings as soon as possible in accordance with the spirit and provisions of the 1945 Constitution." As mentioned earlier, this constitution stipulates that the President's term is five years and provides for a Vice President as the legal successor to the President. Nasution repeatedly emphasized the need to act in accordance with the 1945 Constitution, and it goes without saying that he wants to appoint himself as Vice President.
    The American *Washington Post* published a Jakarta report on March 31 under the title "New Leaders Want to Banish Sukarno." The report said: "Key civilian and military leaders in Indonesia's new cabinet are now convinced that Sukarno must be stripped of all power, and perhaps even banished." The report said, "Sukarno is being vigorously isolated and rendered ineffective. For example, in the new cabinet, he cannot deal directly with ministers, but must go through the top three people controlling the departments (Suharto, Malik, and Sultan Hamengkubuwono)."
    The *New York Times* published an editorial on the 5th, saying, "Sukarno's scope of activity is now tightly restricted. His telephones, visitors, and movements are all monitored by the military." The American newspaper also praised this greatly, saying, "Indonesian Army leaders are skillfully controlling the slow, roundabout, and careful process of defeating President Sukarno."
    Japan's Jiji Press reported from Tokyo on the 4th, citing well-informed sources, that "the newly formed Indonesian cabinet has suggested that Sukarno take a long vacation abroad. It is said that some leaders are demanding the complete restoration of the 1945 Constitution and are demanding that Sukarno appoint Nasution to the currently vacant position of Vice President."
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 6th - News: Adam Malik, the Foreign Minister in the newly formed anti-communist cabinet of the Indonesian right-wing generals group, made a statement on foreign policy on the 4th, openly stating that Indonesia will pursue a policy of relying on the United States and stopping the confrontation with "Malaysia."
    According to reports, Malik said at a press conference in Jakarta on the 4th that "since some recent events occurred in our country, Indonesia has regained... the sympathy of Western countries, including Western countries." He said that the Indonesian government believes that "measures in foreign policy should be aimed at expanding Indonesia's financial and economic cooperation with the outside world, whether Western or Eastern countries, without harming national interests." Malik said that Indonesia will "try to improve relations with the United States," and "we will do our best to make this relationship stabilize quickly."
    Malik also announced in his speech on the 4th that the Indonesian government "will consider joining various international organizations, including the United Nations... so that it can more easily solve urgent domestic and foreign problems." Indonesia announced its withdrawal from the United Nations on January 7, 1965, because of the US and British imperialists pushing "Malaysia" into the United Nations Security Council.
    In his speech on the 4th, Malik further stated that regarding Indonesia's relations with "Malaysia," Indonesia "will always open the door to peaceful solutions." Prior to this, Malik said after attending the "Crush Malaysia Command" meeting at the Bogor Presidential Palace on the 3rd, "Once talks begin, the military confrontation (with Malaysia) will be eased," "We do not want to fight and talk at the same time."
    In his speech on the 4th, Malik also openly attacked China. He echoed the imperialists' rhetoric, describing the Indonesian government's anti-imperialist policy before the September 30th incident as "relying on" China. Prior to this, in an interview with reporters from Japan's *Yomiuri Shimbun* on March 31, Malik kept silent about the countless insane anti-China crimes committed by Indonesian reactionary forces, and even said that China should "bear full responsibility" for the relations between the two countries and clamored that improving relations between the two countries "depends on China's attitude."
    Japan's *Mainichi Shimbun* commented on Malik's statement on foreign policy on the 5th, saying that this statement shows that Indonesia's "new government has openly revealed a bold basic foreign policy with a strong pro-Western color that goes beyond the scope of the non-alignment line." Kyodo News commented on the 4th that Malik's speech "seems to be completely free from the diplomatic line of Sukarno and Subandrio," and "the fact that such a bold and straightforward 'new line' was put forward surprised observers."
    The US government immediately welcomed Malik's statement expressing goodwill towards the United States. According to the US Information Agency, State Department press officer Wright said in Washington on the same day: "We note the statement by the Foreign Minister that the Indonesian government intends to do its best to improve and harmonize relations with the United States. We, like the Indonesian government, hope to achieve this." According to a Jakarta report published in the British *Sunday Times* on the 3rd, Indonesia's "tentative efforts to restore Western aid, especially US aid, are already underway," and "Malik has already met with US Ambassador Green." Japan's Kyodo News reported on the 4th that Malik's statement on foreign policy "is the first public announcement by the new regime of its intention to improve relations with the United States, and at the same time, Indonesia hopes for US economic assistance."
    United Nations Secretary-General U Thant welcomed Indonesia's return to the United Nations on the 4th. He said this was "welcome news." U Thant is studying how to enable Indonesia to return to the United Nations.
    The British *Sunday Times* said on the 3rd that easing the confrontation with "Malaysia" is "a prerequisite for obtaining urgently needed foreign aid."

    印度尼西亚右派将领集团完成夺取国家政权的政变计划后
    宣布要投靠美国停止对抗“马来西亚”
    正在针对苏加诺总统采取进一步行动
    华盛顿再次拍手叫好，赞赏右派将领集团的反动措施
    新华社六日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派将领集团在完成夺取国家政权的政变计划以后，正在针对苏加诺总统采取进一步行动。
    来自雅加达的消息表明，右派将领集团显然对目前的状况还不满足。三月三十一日，在雅加达再次发生了属于右派的“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动组织”的学生们的示威，要求临时人民协商会议给苏加诺总统的任期规定一个期限，剥夺他的“终身总统”的称号。学生们要求遵守印度尼西亚一九四五年宪法的规定，这个宪法规定总统任期为五年，并设有副总统，作为总统的合法继承者。
    接着，苏哈托在二日发表讲话说，“为了内阁工作的顺利进行”，“人民的意见和要求应当通过合作国会和临时人民协商会议来表达”。他在五日更露骨地说，“拥有最高权力的是临时人民协商会议，而总统不过是一位执行协商会议决定的国家政策的官员。”苏加诺总统“是从属于协商会议的”，“总统不是独裁者，他不拥有无限的权力”。
    纳苏蒂安也在五日发表讲话，主张“立即清洗和完善合作国会和临时人民协商会议，以便根据一九四五年宪法的精神和规定尽快举行会议”。如前所述，这个宪法规定总统任期为五年，并设有副总统，作为总统的合法继承者。纳苏蒂安一再强调要按一九四五年宪法办事，不言而喻，是想自封为副总统。
    美国的《华盛顿邮报》三月三十一日在《新领导人想要放逐苏加诺》的标题下，刊登了一条雅加达报道。报道说：“印度尼西亚新内阁中的主要文武领导人现在深信，必须剥夺苏加诺的全部权力，甚至或许要把他放逐”。报道说，“正在大力孤立苏加诺和使他失去作用。例如，在新内阁中，他不能直接同部长们打交道，而须通过控制各部的最高的三个人（苏哈托、马利克和苏丹·哈孟库·布诺沃）。”
    《纽约时报》五日发表社论说，“苏加诺的活动范围现在是严密地受到限制的。他的电话、来客和行踪全都受到军方监视。”这家美国报纸还大为赞赏地说，“印度尼西亚陆军领导人正在熟练地控制着击败苏加诺总统的缓慢的、迂回的、小心的过程。”
    日本的时事通讯社四日从东京援引消息灵通人士的话报道，“新成立的印度尼西亚内阁建议苏加诺到国外长期休假。据说，有些领导人要求完全恢复一九四五年宪法，要求苏加诺任命纳苏蒂安担任现在空着的副总统职位。”
    新华社六日讯　雅加达消息：在印度尼西亚右派将领集团新成立的反共内阁中担任外交部长的阿达姆·马利克四日发表关于外交政策的谈话，公开表示印度尼西亚将奉行投靠美国、停止对“马来西亚”的对抗的政策。
    据报道，马利克四日在雅加达举行记者招待会上说，“自从我们国内最近发生一些事件以来，印度尼西亚已经重新获得……包括西方国家的同情”。他说，印度尼西亚政府认为，“外交政策方面的措施应该是在不损害民族利益的条件下，朝向扩大印度尼西亚与外界的，不管是西方还是东方国家在财经上的合作。”马利克说，印度尼西亚将“设法改善同美国的关系”，“我们将尽我们最大的力量使这种关系很快平稳起来”。
    马利克在四日的讲话中还宣布，印度尼西亚政府“将考虑加入各种国际机构，包括联合国……从而能更容易地解决国内和国外的紧迫问题。”印度尼西亚是由于美、英帝国主义把“马来西亚”塞进联合国安全理事会，在一九六五年一月七日宣布退出联合国的。
    马利克在四日讲话中还进一步表示，对于印度尼西亚同“马来西亚”的关系，印度尼西亚“将一直敞开和平解决的大门”。在这以前，马利克三日在参加茂物总统府举行的“粉碎马来西亚指挥部”会议后说，“一旦会谈开始，（同马来西亚的）军事对抗就将缓和”，“我们并不想边打边谈”。
    马利克在四日的讲话中还公开地攻击中国。他附和帝国主义者的论调，把印度尼西亚政府在九月三十日事件以前奉行反对帝国主义的政策，说成是“依靠”中国。在这以前，马利克在三月三十一日在对日本《读卖新闻》的记者发表的谈话中，闭口不谈印度尼西亚反动势力犯下的无数疯狂反华罪行，竟说什么中国应对两国之间的关系“负完全的责任”，并且叫嚷改善两国的关系“取决于中国的态度”。
    日本《每日新闻》五日就马利克关于外交政策的谈话发表评论说，这个谈话表明印度尼西亚“新政府公然亮出了超出不结盟路线的范围、倾向西方的色彩浓厚的，大胆的基本外交政策”。共同社四日的评论说，马利克的讲话，“似乎是完全摆脱了苏加诺、苏班德里约的外交路线”，“这样大胆而直率地提出‘新路线’的事实，使观察家们也感到吃惊”。
    美国政府对马利克的这个向美国表示亲善的谈话，立刻表示欢迎。据美国新闻处报道，美国国务院新闻发布官赖特当天在华盛顿发表谈话说：“我们注意到这位外交部长所说的印度尼西亚政府打算尽最大努力使同美国的关系得到改善和融洽的谈话。我们和印度尼西亚政府一样希望能做到这一点。”据英国《星期日泰晤士报》三日刊载的雅加达消息报道，印度尼西亚“对恢复西方援助特别是美国援助的试探已经在进行中”，“马利克已经同美国大使格林会晤”。日本共同社四日报道说，马利克的这个关于外交政策的谈话，“是新政权成立后第一次公开宣布打算同美国改善关系，同时，印度尼西亚盼望美国的经济援助。”
    联合国秘书长吴丹四日表示欢迎印度尼西亚回到联合国。他说，这是“令人欢迎的消息”。吴丹正研究如何使印度尼西亚能够回到联合国的问题。
    英国《星期日泰晤士报》三日说，缓和对“马来西亚”的对抗是“作为取得迫切需要外援的一个先决条件”。
