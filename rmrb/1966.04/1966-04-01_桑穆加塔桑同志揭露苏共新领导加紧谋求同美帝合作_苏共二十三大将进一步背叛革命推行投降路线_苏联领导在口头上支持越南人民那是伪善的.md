    Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, March 30th - S.A. Wickremesinghe, member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of Ceylon, issued a press communiqué on the 26th regarding the 23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, stating that this congress "will further systematize the betrayal of revolutionary principles and the acceptance of the class collaboration theory and complete surrender theory first proposed by Khrushchev."
    The press communiqué stated, "The CPSU Congress is usually a matter of attention in the revolutionary movements around the world. This is not only because it is the party founded by the great Lenin, but also because it was the first to establish a working-class regime and begin the task of building socialism.
    "However, since Stalin's death, Khrushchev's usurpation of power, and the placing of the CPSU in a revisionist mold, the situation has greatly changed, and Moscow is no longer a holy land for revolutionaries. The center of the revolution has shifted from Europe to Asia, from Moscow to Beijing. This downward trend of the CPSU began with the infamous 20th Congress, where Khrushchev's 'secret' denunciation of Stalin was heard, and where Khrushchev first systematically developed his revisionist theories of peaceful transition to socialism and peaceful coexistence with imperialism."
    The press communiqué pointed out that the current 23rd Congress, like the 21st and 22nd Congresses, will further systematize the betrayal of revolutionary principles and the acceptance of the class collaboration theory and complete surrender theory first proposed by Khrushchev. It stated that Khrushchev "led the Soviet people away from their earlier revolutionary path and imposed his erroneous revisionist theory of class collaboration on them. But his actions were too absurd and too openly exposed his intentions. He had to step down. His followers are following in his footsteps, and they are even more cunning than him. They are pursuing Khrushchevism without Khrushchev. There will undoubtedly be some changes in tactics." "We can expect to hear many words condemning U.S. imperialism on the Vietnam issue. But all of this is to deceive the Soviet people so that they can more blatantly sell them out."
    The press communiqué said that since Khrushchev came to power, the best barometer for measuring the changes that have taken place in the Soviet leadership has been the reaction of the imperialists. Their assessments are venomous but realistic. As the Parisian newspaper *Combat* pointed out, the situation has changed because a special Russo-American relationship has been established since the Cuban Missile Crisis, and this relationship has somehow remained despite the Vietnam War. This newspaper was commenting on the important NATO meeting held in Paris from December 14 to 16, 1965. According to this newspaper, the meeting "made a clear distinction between the Soviet Union and China." "With the former, it is possible to negotiate; with the latter, a cautious approach must be taken—it cannot even be trusted." Another Parisian newspaper, *Paris Today*, said: "One aspect of the NATO Ministerial Council meeting that has gone unnoticed is the speech by the U.S. Secretary of Defense, who asked NATO to shift its attention from the issues routinely discussed since 1949 (i.e., the Russian threat) to the so-called Chinese threat." This refers to Secretary of State Rusk's impassioned appeal to America's European allies to regard China as the main danger in the world and his absurd declaration that Europe's fate is being decided on the battlefields of Vietnam. He made no mention of any threat from Russia. There is nothing to report on the Western front. The Russian "threat" has been replaced by the "Yellow Peril"!
    Equally interesting is the reaction of U.S. Vice President Humphrey after his meeting with Kosygin in New Delhi. Humphrey said that Kosygin was a "thoughtful and rational man," and then he stated: "But, I think, the Russians are primarily concerned about China's expansionism and aggressive attitude. If this is the case, then they are calling for the containment of Communist China, and one of the best ways to accomplish this containment is to maintain peace in Southeast Asia."
    The press communiqué said, "Thus, we see the major representatives of American imperialism's complete reevaluation of the Soviet Union. The Soviet leaders have also been quick to take corresponding action. Recently, two important books have been officially published in the Soviet Union. One is *The Soviet Union and the United States—Their Political and Economic Relations*. It promotes the 'great significance' of Soviet-American cooperation and says that cooperation between 'two powerful countries' is not only 'in the interests of the Soviet and American peoples' but also 'absolutely necessary for the fate of all mankind'. This book emphasizes that the Soviet Union's policy of establishing comprehensive cooperation with the United States is unwavering.
    "The other book is entitled *The Dynamics of American Foreign Policy*. This book also promotes Soviet-American cooperation dominating the world and glorifies U.S. imperialist leaders. This book says: 'Soviet-American relations, the relations between the two most powerful countries in the world, are the axis of world politics and the main basis of international peace.' 'The Soviet Union hopes to live in peace and cooperate with the United States because it recognizes that Soviet-American relations are of the greatest importance in contemporary world politics and in matters of war and peace.'" "Therefore, what the current Soviet leadership is seeking is not to unite all forces against U.S. imperialism—the number one enemy of mankind. On the other hand, the Soviet leadership is seeking cooperation and unity with the leading imperialist country—the butcher who slaughters the Vietnamese people. It seeks not the ultimate defeat of U.S. imperialism, the head of world imperialism, but to cooperate and coexist with it.
    "This reactionary revisionist concept of the Soviet Union is stated extremely clearly in an article entitled 'Geneva: Disarmament Committee' in the sixth issue of the Soviet magazine *New Times* this year. According to this article, there are 'two diametrically opposed concepts' in the world today, the Tashkent concept and the Vietnam concept. The former is beneficial to mankind. The latter is detrimental to mankind.
    "This could not be clearer. Tashkent seeks to resolve the differences between two capitalist countries—India and Pakistan—so that they can unite with the Soviet Union and the imperialist countries to form an anti-China united front. In other words, Tashkent is part of an imperialist anti-China conspiracy. Vietnam means the heroic resistance of a small and brave nation against the most brutal aggression of foreign U.S. imperialism. The fact that the Soviet leadership openly states that it prefers the Tashkent concept shows the extent of its political degeneration. Incidentally, this also exposes the hypocrisy of their verbal support for the heroic Vietnamese people."
    The press communiqué, in discussing the phenomena of degeneration occurring in the Soviet Union—the restoration of capitalism, the influx of bourgeois culture, etc.—said that this was caused by the mistakes made by the Soviet leadership. "As long as the capitalist encirclement of the Soviet Union continues to exist, and as long as capitalism exists in the world, Soviet society is easily harmed by the attacks of bourgeois ideology. This is why the final victory of the world revolution is in the interests of the people of all countries that have not yet been liberated, as well as in the interests of the Soviet people. Class struggle does not cease after the establishment of socialism. In most cases, the struggle intensifies. The working class faces the most frantic activities of the overthrown classes and all bourgeois remnants to restore capitalism. Only the working class's greatest vigilance and most ruthless dictatorship over the former exploiting classes and their social connections in the current socialist society can ensure that the socialist order continues to prevail."
    The Soviet leaders "opened the door to the influx of all kinds of bourgeois influences. Due to excessive wage differences, a new vested interest class has emerged, which is not interested in revolutionary struggles or supporting revolutions in other countries. The dictatorship of the proletariat has become relaxed. Speculation and embezzlement have become commonplace. Partial restoration of capitalism has been permitted. Khrushchev emerged as the representative of all these forces."
    The press communiqué said, "The Communist Party of China and other Marxist-Leninist parties have learned lessons from the mistakes made by the Soviet leaders, and they are taking measures to ensure that this kind of degeneration does not occur in their countries. In addition to fighting against the remnants of the old society in the political, ideological, and organizational aspects, China is vigorously educating the younger generation—the successors to the revolution. Their goal is to shatter the hopes of the imperialists, who hope that after the death of the current revolutionary leaders in China, the Chinese revolution will also regress. This will inevitably be a constant and relentless process of struggle."
    The communiqué concluded, "Today, world imperialism is facing a deep crisis. It is facing defeat everywhere—in Vietnam, in the Dominican Republic, in the Congo (Leopoldville), etc. Revolutionary forces are moving towards the moment of victory. It is at this stage that imperialism must call upon its last reserves—the modern revisionists. They are acting together with the imperialists to contain China and undermine the revolutionary movement, just as the Social Democrats immediately helped the imperialists to isolate the Soviet Union after the October Revolution. But just as the imperialists and their agents within the working class were defeated at that time, they will be defeated again. The world revolutionary movement will have twists and turns. But it will ultimately triumph. Neither world imperialism nor its agents, the modern revisionists, can prevent this."

    桑穆加塔桑同志揭露苏共新领导加紧谋求同美帝合作
    苏共二十三大将进一步背叛革命推行投降路线
    苏联领导在口头上支持越南人民那是伪善的
    新华社科伦坡三十日电　锡兰共产党政治局委员、书记处书记桑穆加塔桑二十六日就苏联共产党第二十三次代表大会发表新闻公报指出：这次大会“将进一步把背叛革命原则和接受赫鲁晓夫首先提出的阶级合作理论和彻底投降理论的作法系统化”。
    新闻公报说，“苏共的代表大会通常在全世界的革命运动中是引起注意的。这不仅因为它是伟大列宁缔造的党，而且还因为它是第一个建立了工人阶级政权和开始执行建设社会主义的任务的党。
      “但是自从斯大林逝世、赫鲁晓夫篡夺政权、把苏共放入修正主义模子里以来，情况已大大改变了，莫斯科不再是革命者的圣地。革命中心已从欧洲转移到亚洲，从莫斯科转移到北京。苏共的这种没落趋向是从恶名昭著的二十大开始的，那次大会听到了赫鲁晓夫对斯大林的‘秘密’谴责，在那次大会上，赫鲁晓夫第一次系统地发展了他关于向社会主义和平过渡和与帝国主义和平共处的修正主义理论。”
    新闻公报指出，目前这次二十三大，象二十一大和二十二大一样，将进一步把背叛革命原则和接受赫鲁晓夫首先提出的阶级合作理论和彻底投降理论的作法系统化。它说，赫鲁晓夫“使苏联人民离开了他们早先的革命道路，并把他的错误的阶级合作的修正主义理论强加在他们的头上。但是他的作法过分荒唐，过于公开地暴露自己的意图。他不得不下台。他的追随者步他的后尘，而且比他更加狡猾。他们奉行没有赫鲁晓夫的赫鲁晓夫主义。毫无疑问，作法将会有某些改变。”“我们可以预料将听到许多在越南问题上谴责美帝国主义的言词。但是所有这一切都是为了欺骗苏联人民，以便能够更加变本加厉地出卖他们。”
    新闻公报说，自从赫鲁晓夫上台以来，衡量苏联领导已经发生的变化的最好的气压计是帝国主义者的反应。他们的估计是刻毒的但是现实的。正如巴黎《战斗报》所指出的，情况已经发生了变化，因为自从古巴危机以来，俄—美特殊关系已经建立起来，尽管发生越南战争，这种关系不知为什么仍然保持下来了。这家报纸是对一九六五年十二月十四日到十六日在巴黎举行的北大西洋公约组织的重要会议发表这些意见的。据这家报纸说，会议“在苏联和中国之间作了明确的区分”。“同前者，有可能谈判；同后者，必须采取谨慎的态度——甚至不能信任”。另一家巴黎报纸《今日巴黎报》说：“没有受到人们注意的北大西洋公约组织部长理事会会议的一个方面是美国国防部长的讲话，他要求北大西洋公约组织转变一九四九年以来照例讨论的问题（即俄国的威胁）而致力于研究所谓中国的威胁。”这是指国务卿腊斯克对美国的欧洲盟国发出的把中国当作世界上主要的危险的激动的呼吁以及他的荒唐的宣告：欧洲的命运正在越南战场上决定。他只字未提来自俄国的任何威胁。西线无战事。俄国“威胁”已经被“黄祸”所代替！
    同样令人感兴趣的是，美国副总统汉弗莱在新德里同柯西金会谈之后的反应。汉弗莱说柯西金是“有思想和理智的人”，然后他认为：“但是，我想，俄国人首先是对中国的扩张主义和咄咄逼人的态度感到关切。如果情况是这样的话，那么，他们就要求遏制共产党中国，而且，完成这个遏制的目的的最好方法之一就是在东南亚保持和平”。
    新闻公报说，“这样，我们看到了美国帝国主义的主要代表对苏联的全部重新估价。苏联领导人也很快采取了相应的行动。最近，在苏联，正式出版两本重要的书。一本是《苏联和美国——它们的政治和经济关系》。它宣传了苏美合作的‘重要意义’并说‘两个强大的国家’之间的合作不仅‘符合苏联和美国人民的利益’，而且‘对全人类的命运也是非常必要的’。这本书强调指出，苏联要同美国建立全面合作的政策是不变的。
      “另一本书的题目是《美国对外政策的动力》。这本书也鼓吹苏美合作主宰世界，并且美化美帝国主义领袖。这本书说：‘苏美关系，世界上两个最强大的国家的关系，是世界政治的轴心和国际和平的主要基础。’‘苏联希望同美国和平相处与合作，因为认识到苏美关系在当代世界政治中以及在战争与和平问题上具有最大的重要意义。’“因此，苏联现领导谋求的不是团结一切反对美帝国主义——人类的头号敌人——的力量。另一方面，苏联领导谋求的是同首要的帝国主义国家——屠杀越南人民的刽子手——的合作和团结。它谋求的不是全世界帝国主义的头子美帝国主义的最后失败，而是同它合作共处。
    “苏联这种反动的修正主义概念在苏联《新时代》周刊今年第六期一篇题为《日内瓦：裁军委员会》的文章中说得极其清楚。据这篇文章说，今天世界上存在着‘两种截然对立的概念’，塔什干和越南这两种概念。前一种概念有利于人类。后一种不利于人类。
    “这番话说得再明白不过了，塔什干是想使两个资本主义国家——印度和巴基斯坦——解决它们的分歧，好使它们同苏联和帝国主义国家联合起来结成反华的统一战线。换句话说，塔什干是帝国主义反华阴谋的一部分。越南意味着一个小而勇敢的民族对外来的美帝国主义最残暴的侵略进行的英勇抗战。苏联领导竟然公开表示它喜欢塔什干概念，这说明它在政治上堕落到了什么地步。附带说一句，这也暴露了他们口头上支持英勇的越南人民是伪善的。”
    新闻公报在谈到在苏联发生的蜕化——资本主义复辟、资产阶级文化的流入等现象时说，这是苏联领导所犯的错误造成的。“只要资本主义对苏联的包围继续存在，只要世界上还有资本主义，苏联社会就很容易受到资产阶级思想的进攻的损害。这就是为什么世界革命的最后胜利既符合还没有解放的各国人民的利益，也符合苏联人民的利益。阶级斗争在社会主义建立之后并不熄灭。在大部分情况下，斗争加剧了。工人阶级面临着被推翻的阶级和一切资产阶级残余力图复辟的最疯狂的活动。只有工人阶级对目前社会主义社会中的前剥削阶级和他们的社会联系保持最大的警惕和行使最无情的专政，才能保证社会主义秩序继续占优势。”
    苏共领导“敞开大门让形形色色的资产阶级影响流进去。由于工资差额过份悬殊，出现了一个新的既得利益阶级，他们对革命斗争或者支持其他国家的革命不感兴趣。无产阶级专政变得松弛了。投机倒把和挪用公款的现象变得司空见惯。部分恢复资本主义得到了容许。赫鲁晓夫就作为所有这些势力的代表出现。”
    新闻公报说，“中国共产党和其他马克思列宁主义政党从苏联领导所犯的错误中汲取了教训，它们正在采取措施，以保证它们国家内不出现这种蜕化。中国除了在政治、意识形态和组织方面同旧社会的残余作斗争之外，正在大力教育年青一代——革命接班人。他们的目的就是要使帝国主义者的希望破灭，帝国主义者希望在中国目前的革命领导人去世之后，中国革命也会倒退。这必然是一个经常的无情的斗争过程。”
    公报最后说，“今天，世界帝国主义面临着深刻的危机。它到处面临失败——在越南、在多米尼加共和国、在刚果（利）等等。革命力量正朝着胜利的时刻前进。正是在这个阶段，帝国主义必须调用它的最后的后备军——现代修正主义者。他们同帝国主义者一起行动来遏制中国和破坏革命运动，就象在十月革命后社会民主党人立即帮助帝国主义者隔离苏联一样。但是，就象帝国主义者和他们在工人阶级内部的代理人在当时遭到失败一样，他们将再次遭到失败。世界革命运动是会有曲折的。但是它最后必将胜利。世界帝国主义和它的代理人现代修正主义者都不能防止这一点。”
