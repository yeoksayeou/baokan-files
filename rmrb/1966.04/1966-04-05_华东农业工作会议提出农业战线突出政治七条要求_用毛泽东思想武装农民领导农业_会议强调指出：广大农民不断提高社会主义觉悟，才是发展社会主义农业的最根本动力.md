    East China Agricultural Work Conference Proposes Seven Political Requirements for the Agricultural Front
    Arming Peasants with Mao Zedong Thought to Lead Agriculture
    The Conference Emphasizes: The Continuous Improvement of Socialist Consciousness Among the Broad Masses of Peasants is the Most Fundamental Driving Force for Developing Socialist Agriculture

    (Our Shanghai Dispatch) The East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee recently held the East China Agricultural Work Conference, focusing on studying the issue of highlighting politics on the agricultural front. After serious discussions, the conference proposed seven requirements for highlighting politics on the agricultural front in East China in the future, calling on leaders at all levels in rural areas to further highlight politics, arm peasants with Mao Zedong Thought, and lead agriculture with Mao Zedong Thought, in order to gradually build modern socialist agriculture and a new socialist countryside.

    Participants in the conference included responsible persons from the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, East China provinces and cities, some prefectural and county committee leaders, and a small number of commune and brigade cadres. Wei Wenbo, Secretary of the East China Bureau Secretariat, spoke at the meeting.

    The conference believes that in recent years, leaders at all levels in rural East China have made some progress in highlighting politics in their work compared to the past. Since the Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, a great socialist education movement has been launched in rural areas, especially due to the widespread organization of cadres and the masses to study Chairman Mao's works, profound changes have taken place in the political landscape of rural areas. Spirit transforms into matter, revolution promotes production. Although East China has experienced varying degrees of natural disasters every year in the past few years, the output of major crops has still increased significantly for four consecutive years. In this process, cadres at all levels have once again received an extremely profound education on the great significance of highlighting politics.

    The problem now is that cadres in many units are not conscious enough in highlighting politics, not highlighting politics in everything and everywhere, but grasping and releasing, doing and stopping. Some have a purely professional viewpoint of seeing things but not people, some have a bureaucratic style of not focusing on political principles, some have an eclectic error of equating professional work with politics, and some have a pragmatic tendency to treat political work only as a temporary measure. This is not in line with the objective requirements of the development of socialist cause and the responsibilities they shoulder.

    Always Adhere to Grasping Class Struggle and the Struggle Between the Two Roads
    The conference believes that highlighting politics on the agricultural front means always adhering to grasping class struggle and the struggle between the two roads, so that agriculture can continuously advance in the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao. The conference cited a large number of facts to prove that because the collective economy of the people's commune is a socialist economy, and because peasants still have some inherent characteristics of small producers for a long time, therefore, whether in times of smooth production development, or in times of temporary difficulties, in areas with relatively good natural conditions, or in areas with relatively poor natural conditions, there is always class struggle and the struggle between the two roads without exception. If this is ignored, it fundamentally deviates from the reality of socialist agriculture, not only can it not give full play to the huge potential contained in socialist agriculture and rapidly push production forward, but also there will be a danger of losing direction. For example, individual units did not highlight politics in times of temporary difficulties, and production stagnated; some individual units, after years of rising production, once neglected highlighting politics, and capitalist spontaneous tendencies took the opportunity to raise their heads. Therefore, no matter when, where, or under what conditions, we must not neglect highlighting politics in the slightest.

    Transforming Peasants with the Proletarian Worldview is a Strategic Task
    The conference pointed out that a strategic task on the agricultural front is to arm peasants with Mao Zedong Thought, transform peasants with the proletarian worldview, so that they can gradually get rid of the constraints of the old ideas and old habits of small producers, see the collective from one family and one household, see the large collective from the small collective, see the whole of China and the whole world from the large collective, and become laborers with a high degree of socialist consciousness. The continuous improvement of socialist consciousness among the broad masses of peasants is the most fundamental driving force for developing socialist agriculture. During the land reform, when the broad masses of peasants raised their consciousness and understood the fundamental question of "who feeds whom," they launched a stormy anti-feudal struggle, completely destroying the feudal land system and greatly liberating the productive forces. In the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, when peasants further raised their consciousness, solved the problem of farming for whom, and linked farming with the revolutionary cause, they would have a broad vision and a broad mind, and throw themselves into the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experimentation with great revolutionary enthusiasm, and give full play to unlimited creativity, march towards nature, and rapidly push socialist agriculture forward. Shuangmiao Brigade of Shuangmiao Commune in Chiping County, Shandong Province, and Toubao Brigade of Gaonian Commune in Huaiyin County, Jiangsu Province, whose experiences were introduced at the meeting, one is a saline-alkali waterlogged area on the vast plain of western Shandong, and the other is a "bottom of the pot depression" on the edge of Hongze Lake, which have historically been plagued by frequent natural disasters and very low grain yields, relying on state relief. In recent years, the Party branches of these two units have continuously educated peasants with Mao Zedong Thought, enabling cadres and commune members to establish the ambition to dare to make revolution and launched a tenacious struggle against natural disasters such as drought, flood, and alkali. Production conditions have changed year by year, and grain yields have risen year by year. Now, they have all become units with surplus grain to sell to the state. Xuhang Commune in Jiading County, a suburb of Shanghai, and Daxing Commune in Qidong County, Jiangsu Province, are both high-yielding units along the river and the coast. Some cadres and commune members once had a complacent mentality of being content with the status quo after years of production development. Because the commune Party committee timely put the question of whether to continue the revolution after becoming rich, and whether the pace of development and production could be stopped, sharply in front of everyone, organized cadres and commune members to study Chairman Mao's works, and carried out in-depth and meticulous ideological work, so that many people got rid of the shackles of the small-peasant economy of "a young couple, two small children, three small houses, four points of private plot, and five old hens," and established the idea of farming for the revolution and the view of continuous revolution. After hard struggles, they created new conditions for increasing production, explored new ways to increase production, and realized high yields and higher yields. The examples of these units greatly inspired the comrades attending the meeting.

    Gradually Realize Mechanization and Electrification on the Basis of Collectivization
    The conference also proposed that gradually realizing mechanization and electrification on the basis of agricultural collectivization is the fundamental line of the Party on the agricultural issue. Although the East China agricultural front has made some progress in gradually realizing mechanization and electrification, and some places have basically realized irrigation electrification, generally speaking, the level of agricultural mechanization and electrification is still very low. From now on, this work must be put on the important agenda of leaders at all levels, and plans must be made, actively piloted, experiences accumulated, and conditions created in all aspects to gradually realize mechanization and electrification. The conference believes that because our agriculture is advancing along the correct political direction, therefore, gradually realizing mechanization and electrification can more rapidly develop agricultural production and fundamentally solve the contradictions between the working class and the peasantry; moreover, existence determines consciousness, it can also enable peasants to gradually change the situation of "being able to farm with a hoe" and connect with modern large-scale agricultural production, thereby helping them to further get rid of the ideological influence left over from the small-peasant economy era.

    Studying and Applying Chairman Mao's Works in a Living Way is the Core of Highlighting Politics
    How to highlight politics on the agricultural front? According to the experiences of various places in East China and the discussions at the meeting, everyone believes that this is to run agriculture according to Mao Zedong Thought, and to put agricultural production, technology, and business under the command of Mao Zedong Thought. Specifically, there are mainly seven points: First, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in a living way to promote the revolutionization of cadres and the masses. We must put studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way in the first place, and constantly use Mao Zedong Thought to transform the worldview and methodology of the broad masses of cadres, raise their consciousness, and improve their work; constantly arm the broad masses of peasants with Mao Zedong Thought, and transform their small-peasant economy worldview. Cadres must take the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way, and at the same time organize peasants to study and guide peasants to study. This point is the core of highlighting politics on the agricultural front. By adhering to this point, we can drive the remaining six points.

    Second, adhere to taking class struggle as the key link, and grasp the three great revolutions together. Adhering to class struggle as the key link means adhering to the socialist and communist direction. The three great revolutions are neither parallel nor isolated. We must have a key link and grasp them together; we must not be blind practitioners who are separated from politics, nor can we be empty politicians who are separated from practice.

    Third, carry forward the spirit of Dazhai and take the road of Dazhai. The faster and more widely the spirit of Dazhai is popularized, the more effective the construction of modern socialist agriculture and the construction of a new socialist countryside will be. We must adhere to the spirit of self-reliance, work hard on farmland capital construction and intensive cultivation, and actively develop diversified operations.

    Fourth, resolutely rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants and conscientiously implement the four major democracies. Only by resolutely implementing the Party's class line in rural areas can we consolidate the proletarian dictatorship, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, defeat capitalist spontaneous forces, and continuously consolidate and expand the socialist position in rural areas. Implementing the four major democracies is an important issue related to whether or not the wisdom and talents of the masses can be fully utilized, the sense of ownership of the masses can be promoted, and collective economy can be run well with concerted efforts. We must adhere to implementation and have practical and feasible systems.

    Fifth, strictly implement the Party's policies and correctly handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual. The Party's policies are the life of the Party. Only by strictly implementing the Party's various policies in rural areas can we maximize the socialist enthusiasm of the masses. Correctly handling the relationship between the three is an important policy of the Party. When handling it, we should pay attention to the combination of the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual, and we must not confuse communist education with the Party's current policies.

    Sixth, vigorously grasp the revolutionary construction of the Party branch and carry out a mass-based movement of comparing, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to educate all Party members, establish the three major work styles of linking theory with practice, closely linking with the masses, and self-criticism, and give play to the role of the Party branch as a fighting fortress in the three great revolutions. And we must take the Party branch as the core, with the goal of creating more "four good" communes and brigades, and cultivating more "six good" commune members, and carry out the movement of comparing, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing. Comparing, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing must highlight politics, ideological leadership, learning from others first learn from ambition, helping people first help the heart, humbly find gaps, and dare to surpass the advanced.

    Seventh, vigorously grasp living ideas and do ideological and political work in all work. No matter what we do, we must grasp living ideas and do the work of people. To grasp living ideas, cadres must go to the masses, must participate in labor, must promote democracy, and give play to the role of various organizations; we must be good at analyzing, grasping the essence, promoting positive factors, overcoming negative factors, and constantly improving the socialist consciousness of the masses.

    The Key Lies in the Revolutionization of Cadres at All Levels, Especially Leaders Above the County Committee
    The conference emphasized that the key to highlighting politics on the agricultural front lies in the revolutionization of cadres at all levels, especially leaders above the county committee. If leading cadres do not take the lead in realizing revolutionization, it is impossible to demand the masses with revolutionary requirements; if leading cadres do not establish the proletarian worldview, it is impossible to transform peasants with the proletarian worldview; if leading cadres lack the concept of class struggle, it is impossible to lead the masses to conduct a victorious struggle against capitalist spontaneous forces; if leading cadres are content with the status quo and have no ambition, it is impossible to stand upright and lead the masses to continuously revolutionize and thoroughly revolutionize.

    At this conference, some county committee leaders from various provinces and cities introduced their successful experiences in adhering to Mao Zedong Thought in command, promoting leadership revolutionization, and highlighting politics in their units. Mengyin County, Shandong Province, is located in the Yimeng Mountain area, with relatively poor natural conditions. Some comrades of the county committee once had a mental state of inaction, passively adapting to work and urging plowing and sowing. In 1964, the leading comrades of the county committee studied Chairman Mao's works with the spirit of rectification, and carried out self-revolution; and mobilized the following cadres to put forward opinions and help the county committee revolutionize; and compared with advanced areas to find gaps and dig ideas, deepening self-revolution; then the members of the county committee took "On Practice" and hoes to the countryside, squatted in spots, and made revolution. As a result, the revolutionary consciousness of the county committee rapidly improved, and it was able to highlight politics in its work, so that the political situation in the county underwent profound changes, and the production situation also changed accordingly.

    This conference also studied the tasks of the East China agricultural front during the Third Five-Year Plan, and put forward different requirements for the further development of agricultural production in the three different regions of the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, mountainous and hilly areas, and along the river, lake, and coast. The conference pointed out that the situation on the East China agricultural front is very good now, and agricultural production has entered a new period of development. As long as we adhere to Mao Zedong Thought in command, adhere to the Party's general line for socialist construction, highlight politics in all our work, and view our work with the dialectical viewpoint of "one divides into two," and be calm promoters, we will definitely be able to continuously achieve new victories and comprehensively complete the glorious and arduous tasks during the Third Five-Year Plan.

    华东农业工作会议提出农业战线突出政治七条要求
    用毛泽东思想武装农民领导农业
    会议强调指出：广大农民不断提高社会主义觉悟，才是发展社会主义农业的最根本动力
    本报上海讯　中共中央华东局最近召开华东农业工作会议，着重研究了农业战线突出政治的问题。会议经过认真讨论后，提出了今后华东地区农业战线突出政治的七条要求，号召农村各级领导进一步突出政治，以毛泽东思想武装农民，用毛泽东思想领导农业，为逐步地建设起现代化的社会主义大农业和社会主义新农村而斗争。
    参加这次会议的有中共中央华东局、华东各省市有关负责人，部分地委、县委负责人和少数公社、大队的干部。华东局书记处书记魏文伯在会上讲了话。
    会议认为，近几年来，华东农村各级领导在各项工作中突出政治，比过去有所进步。党的八届十中全会以后，农村中开展了伟大的社会主义教育运动，特别是由于广泛地组织广大干部和群众学习毛主席著作，农村的政治面貌发生了深刻的变化。精神变物质，革命促生产，华东地区虽然这几年每年都有不同程度的自然灾害，而主要农作物的产量仍然连续四年大幅度上升。各级干部在这过程中，又受到了一次极其深刻的突出政治的伟大意义的教育。
    现在的问题是，有不少单位的干部突出政治还不够自觉，不是事事处处突出政治，而是抓抓放放，做做停停，有的存在见物不见人的单纯业务观点，有的存在不从政治原则着眼的事务主义作风，有的存在把业务同政治平列起来的折衷主义错误，有的存在政治工作只当作临时措施的实用主义倾向。这就同社会主义事业发展的客观要求和他们所担负的责任不相适应。
    始终要坚持抓阶级斗争和两条道路的斗争
    会议认为，农业战线突出政治，就是始终要坚持抓阶级斗争和两条道路的斗争，使农业沿着毛主席所指引的方向，不断前进。会议列举大量事实证明，由于人民公社集体经济是社会主义性质的经济，由于农民长时期内仍然存在小生产者的某些固有特点，因此，不论在生产顺利发展的时候，或者遇到暂时困难的时候，在自然条件比较好的地区，或者自然条件比较差的地区，都无例外地存在着阶级斗争和两条道路的斗争。如果忽视了这一点，就从根本上脱离了社会主义农业的实际，不仅不能发挥社会主义农业所蕴藏的巨大潜力，把生产迅速推向前进，而且会有迷失方向的危险。例如，个别单位在遇到暂时困难的时期，没有突出政治，生产就停滞不前；也有个别单位，在生产连年上升以后，一度忽视了突出政治，资本主义自发倾向又乘机抬头。所以，不论何时何地，也不论在何种条件下，都丝毫不能忽视突出政治。
    用无产阶级世界观改造农民，是一个战略任务
    会议指出，农业战线的一个战略任务，是用毛泽东思想武装农民，用无产阶级世界观改造农民，使他们逐步摆脱小生产者的旧思想、旧习惯的束缚，从一家一户看到集体，从小集体看到大集体，从大集体看到全中国、全世界，成为具有高度社会主义觉悟的劳动者。广大农民不断提高社会主义觉悟，才是发展社会主义农业的最根本的动力。在土地改革的时候，当广大农民提高了觉悟，认识了“谁养活谁”这个根本问题以后，就掀起了暴风骤雨般的反封建斗争，彻底摧毁了封建的土地制度，大大地解放了生产力。在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，当农民进一步提高觉悟，解决了为谁种田的问题，把种田和革命事业联系起来以后，就会眼光远大，胸怀宽广，以极大的革命热情，投入到阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中去，并且发挥无限的创造力，向大自然进军，把社会主义农业迅速推向前进。在会上介绍了经验的山东茌平县双庙公社双庙大队，江苏淮阴县高埝公社头堡大队，一个是鲁西大平原上的盐碱涝洼地区，一个是洪泽湖边上的“锅底洼子”，历来自然灾害频繁，粮食产量很低，依靠国家救济。近几年，这两个单位的党支部不断地用毛泽东思想教育农民，使干部和社员树立了敢于革命的雄心壮志，和旱涝碱等自然灾害展开了顽强的斗争，生产条件一年年变化，粮食产量一年年上升，现在，都已经成为有余粮卖给国家的单位。上海郊区嘉定县的徐行公社，江苏启东县的大兴公社，都是沿江沿海的高产单位，一部分干部和社员在生产连年发展以后，都曾经出现安于现状的自满自足思想。由于公社党委及时地把富了要不要继续革命，是否可以把发展生产的脚步停止下来的问题，尖锐地摆到大家面前，组织干部和社员学习毛主席著作，进行了深入、细致的思想工作，使许多人摆脱了“一对小夫妻，两个小把戏（孩子），三间小堂屋，四分自留地，五只老母鸡”这一小农经济小康思想的束缚，树立了为革命种田的思想和不断革命的观点。他们经过艰苦斗争，创造了新的增产条件，探索出新的增产途径，实现了高产更高产。这些单位的事例，使到会同志受到了很大的启发。
    在集体化基础上，逐步实现机械化、电气化
    这次会议还提出，在农业集体化的基础上，逐步实现机械化、电气化，是党在农业问题上的根本路线。华东农业战线虽然在逐步实现机械化、电气化方面有了一些进展，有的地方已基本上实现灌溉电气化，但总的说来，农业机械化、电气化水平还是十分低的。从现在起，必须把这件工作摆到各级领导的重要议事日程上来，要作出规划，积极试点，积累经验，从各方面创造条件，逐步实现机械化和电气化。会议认为，由于我们的农业是沿着正确的政治方向前进的，因此，逐步实现机械化、电气化，就可以更迅速地发展农业生产，从根本上解决工人阶级和农民阶级的矛盾；而且，存在决定意识，还可以使农民逐步改变“一把锄头就能种田”的状况，和现代化大农业生产联系起来，从而有助于他们进一步摆脱小农经济时期遗留下来的思想影响。
    活学活用毛主席著作，是突出政治的核心
    农业战线怎样突出政治？根据华东各地的经验和会上的讨论，大家认为，这就是按照毛泽东思想办农业，把农业生产、技术、业务置于毛泽东思想的统帅之下。具体说，主要有七条：一、活学活用毛泽东思想，促进干部和群众革命化。要把活学活用毛主席著作放在第一位，不断用毛泽东思想改造广大干部的世界观和方法论，提高觉悟，改进工作；不断用毛泽东思想武装广大农民，改造他们小农经济的世界观。干部要带头活学活用毛主席著作，同时要组织农民学习，辅导农民学习。这一条是农业战线突出政治的核心所在，坚持了这一条，就能够带动其余的六条。
    二、坚持以阶级斗争为纲，三大革命一起抓。坚持阶级斗争为纲，就是坚持社会主义、共产主义方向。三大革命既不是平列的，也不是孤立的，既要有一个纲，又要一起抓；既不要当脱离政治的盲目实践家，又不要当脱离实践的空头政治家。
    三、发扬大寨精神，走大寨之路。大寨精神普及得愈快愈广，建设现代化的社会主义大农业和建设社会主义新农村就愈有成效。要坚持自力更生精神，在农田基本建设上、在精耕细作上下苦功夫，并且要积极开展多种经营。
    四、坚决依靠贫下中农，认真实行四大民主。只有坚决执行党在农村中的阶级路线，才能巩固无产阶级专政，巩固工农联盟，击败资本主义自发势力，不断地巩固和扩大农村社会主义阵地。实行四大民主，是关系到是否能够充分发挥群众的聪明才智，发扬群众当家作主的主人翁感情，群策群力，办好集体经济的一个重要问题，一定要坚持贯彻执行，而且要有切实可行的制度。
    五、严格执行党的政策，正确处理国家、集体、个人三者关系。党的政策是党的生命。只有严格执行党在农村中的各项政策，才能最大限度地调动群众的社会主义积极性。正确处理三者关系，是党的一个重要政策，处理的时候，要注意国家、集体和个人利益的结合，不能把共产主义教育和党的现行政策混淆起来。
    六、狠抓党支部的革命化建设，开展群众性的比学赶帮超运动。要用毛泽东思想教育全体党员，树立理论联系实际、紧密联系群众以及自我批评的三大作风，发挥党支部在三大革命中的战斗堡垒作用。并且要以党支部为核心，以创造更多的“四好”社队、培养更多的“六好”社员为目标，开展比学赶帮超运动。比学赶帮超都要突出政治，思想领先，学人先学志，帮人先帮心，虚心找差距，敢于超先进。
    七、狠抓活思想，把思想政治工作做到一切工作中去。不论做什么事情，都要抓活思想，做人的工作。抓活思想，干部一定要到群众中去，一定要参加劳动，一定要发扬民主，并发挥各种组织的作用；要善于分析，抓住本质，发扬积极因素，克服消极因素，不断提高群众的社会主义觉悟。
    关键在各级干部、特别是县委以上领导干部革命化
    会议强调指出，农业战线突出政治的关键，在于各级干部的革命化，特别是县委以上领导干部的革命化。领导干部不带头实现革命化，就不可能以革命化的要求去要求群众；领导干部不树立无产阶级的世界观，就不可能用无产阶级世界观去改造农民；领导干部缺乏阶级斗争观念，就不可能领导群众向资本主义自发势力进行胜利的斗争；领导干部安于现状，胸无大志，也就不可能挺起腰杆领导群众不断革命、彻底革命。
    这次会上，各省市一些县委领导同志介绍了他们单位坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，促进领导革命化，突出政治的成功经验。山东蒙阴县地处沂蒙山区，自然条件比较差，县委部分同志曾经存在无所作为的精神状态，工作中消极适应，催耕催种。一九六四年，县委领导同志带着问题，以整风精神学习了毛主席著作，进行自我革命；并且发动下面干部提意见，帮助县委革命；又对照先进地区找差距，挖思想，加深自我革命；接着县委成员又分别带着《实践论》和镢头下乡，蹲点闹革命。这样做的结果，县委的革命自觉性迅速提高，工作中能够突出政治，从而使全县的政治局面发生了深刻的变化，生产面貌也随着发生了变化。
    这次会议还研究了华东农业战线第三个五年计划期间的任务，对黄淮平原、山区丘陵和沿江沿湖沿海三类不同地区农业生产的进一步发展，分别提出了不同的要求。会议指出，现在华东农业战线形势很好，农业生产已经进入新的发展时期，只要我们坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，坚持党的社会主义建设总路线，在一切工作中突出政治，并且以“一分为二”的辩证观点看待自己的工作，做冷静的促进派，就一定能够不断取得新的胜利，全面完成第三个五年计划期间的光荣而艰巨的任务。
