    In the leading organs of the Party, whether the "squad leader" has the final say alone, or whether democracy is fully promoted and everyone contributes their ideas and efforts, is a major matter concerning the Party's leadership principles.

    The key to promoting democracy often lies in the "squad leader" patiently listening to different opinions, including those that oppose his own. Generally speaking, praise and opinions that align with one's own are easy to accept; criticism, opinions that do not align with one's own, and even opposition are difficult for many to accept. Some people can accept correct opinions, but not incorrect ones.

    Why is this so? There are issues of consciousness and issues of understanding. Some comrades, upon becoming "squad leaders," consciously or unconsciously place themselves above others, often with the attitude of "what I say goes." If personal "face," "prestige," etc., are mixed in, it becomes even more difficult to listen to others' opinions. In addition, the metaphysical way of thinking is also at play in the minds of some comrades. They do not understand the principle that people will inevitably have different opinions due to differences in work experience, social practice, and so on; this is entirely normal. The "squad leader's" art of leadership lies precisely in listening to various different opinions from multiple perspectives, analyzing and comparing them, and producing correct leadership. If a person only listens to pleasant words and not to harsh words, his thinking will not be comprehensive, and he will have no basis for comparison. Without comparison, he cannot distinguish between right and wrong, and there can be no talk of correct leadership. It can be seen that failing to humbly listen to opinions from all sides will lead to a separation between one's own subjectivity and objective reality, and such leadership cannot be correct.

    Whether a revolutionary has a democratic work style depends fundamentally on whether he has a mass viewpoint. To truly promote the Party's democratic work style, it is necessary to establish a proletarian world outlook and a mass viewpoint. The solution to this problem lies first in earnestly studying Chairman Mao's works, and in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings, placing the interests of the people first, placing the cause of the Party first, and being willing to listen to all kinds of different opinions. Although a "squad leader," one should always place oneself among the masses, rather than above others, be able to "follow good advice" and "pool wisdom," rather than take over everything and act arbitrarily.

### “班长”要善于集思广益

    “班长”要善于集思广益
    在党的领导机关中，是“班长”一个人说了算，还是充分发扬民主，群策群力，这是关系到党的领导原则的大事。
    发扬民主的关键往往在于“班长”耐心地听取不同的意见，包括反对自己的意见。一般地说，听赞扬的话，听符合自己意见的话，是容易入耳的；批评的话，不符合自己意见的话，甚至是反对自己的话，许多人是不容易入耳的。有些人听正确的话还可以，听错误的话就不行了。
    为什么会如此？有意识问题，也有认识问题。有些同志当了“班长”，自觉不自觉地把自己摆在他人之上，常常是“我说了算”。如果掺杂上个人的“面子”、“威信”等等，就更不易听进别人的意见。另外，也有形而上学的思想方法在一些同志头脑里作怪，他们不懂得这样一个道理，人们由于工作经验、社会实践等等方面的不同，必然会产生这样那样的意见，这完全是正常的现象。“班长”的领导艺术，正是在于多方面听取各种不同意见，加以分析和比较，产生出正确的领导来。如果一个人只听顺耳的话，不听逆耳之言，他的思想就不会全面，也就无从进行比较，没有比较就不能分辨事物的是非，就谈不到有正确的领导。由此可见，不虚心地听取各方面的意见，就会使自己的主观同客观实际相分裂，这样的领导，也就不可能是正确的。
    一个革命者有无民主作风，最根本的是个有没有群众观点的问题。要真正能够发扬党的民主作风，就必须树立无产阶级的世界观和群众观点。解决这个问题，首先在于认真学习毛主席著作，按照毛泽东同志的教导，以人民的利益为重，以党的事业为重，乐于倾听各种不同的意见。虽然身为“班长”，能时时置身于群众之中，而不是凌驾于他人之上，能“从善如流”、“集思广益”，而不是包办代替、独断专行。
