    Xinhua News Agency, April 25th dispatch from Bangkok: According to a report on the "Voice of the People of Thailand" radio station on the 22nd, since the end of November of last year, the patriotic people's armed forces in Sawang Daen Din District, Sakon Nakhon Province, northeastern Thailand, have victoriously crushed two "encirclement and suppression" campaigns conducted by U.S. imperialism and its lackey Thanom-Praphas clique.
    The radio station said that at the end of November of last year, under the command of U.S. imperialism, the Thanom clique dispatched more than 400 soldiers, armed police, and "Homeland Defense Volunteers" to "encircle and suppress" the people's armed forces in this area. Due to the resolute resistance of the people's armed forces, this "encirclement and suppression" by the enemy finally went bankrupt. During this "encirclement and suppression," the traitorous Thanom clique's military police barbarously massacred the people, trampled and destroyed a large number of crops, and plundered the property of the masses, causing great losses to the people.
    From the beginning of January to the end of February this year, the Thanom clique again dispatched a battalion of the 13th Mixed Regiment stationed in Udon Thani, paratroopers, border patrol teams, local police, and "Homeland Defense Volunteers" to "encircle and suppress" the people's armed forces in this area. They were met with heroic counterattacks by the people's armed forces, resulting in eight military police being killed and dozens wounded. The radio station emphasized that the victory of the anti-"encirclement and suppression" campaign in Sawang Daen Din District has encouraged all the Thai people who are engaged in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and the Thanom-Praphas clique. This victory proves that as long as the oppressed people take up arms and wage a resolute struggle against the enemy, they will surely be able to defeat the enemy armed with airplanes, tanks, and artillery.

    在东北部接连粉碎美帝和他侬集团的两次“围剿”
    人民武装的胜利鼓舞了正在进行斗争的泰国人民
    新华社二十五日讯　曼谷消息：据“泰国人民之声”电台二十二日报道，去年十一月底以来，泰国东北部沙功那空府沙旺玲辇县的爱国人民武装力量胜利地粉碎了美帝国主义和它的仆从他侬—巴博集团进行的两次“围剿”。
    电台说，去年十一月底，在美帝国主义指挥下，他侬集团出动了四百多名军队、武装警察和“保卫国土志愿队”，“围剿”这个地区的人民武装力量，由于人民武装力量进行了坚决的抵抗，使敌人这次“围剿”终于破产。在这次“围剿”中，他侬卖国集团的军警野蛮地屠杀人民，糟踏和破坏了大量农作物，掠夺人民群众的财产，使人民遭到极大损失。
    今年一月初到二月底，他侬集团再次出动了驻乌隆府的第十三混合团的一个营、伞兵部队、边境巡逻队、地方警察和“保卫国土志愿队”等，“围剿”这个地区的人民武装。它们遭到人民武装的英勇还击，有军警八人被打死，数十人被打伤。电台强调指出，沙旺玲辇县反“围剿”的胜利鼓舞了正在进行反对美帝国主义和他侬—巴博集团的全体泰国人民。这个胜利证明，被压迫人民只要拿起武器跟敌人进行坚决的斗争，就一定能够战胜用飞机、坦克、大炮武装起来的敌人。
