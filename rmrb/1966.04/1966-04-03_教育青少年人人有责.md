    Everyone is Responsible for Educating Young People
    Mudanjiang Hualin Rubber Factory Party Committee
    In 1964, our factory established the "Youth Home," organizing most of the middle and primary school graduates who had not continued their education into three teams based on their age and education level. We adopted a method of "working when there is work, learning when there is no work." On the one hand, we helped them study politics, language, mathematics, and other subjects. On the other hand, we organized them to participate in production labor in factories, rural areas, and service industries. Many students improved their class consciousness, enhanced their labor perspective, and initially established the idea of serving the people through political study and labor training. Last year, some students went to work in factories, some became members of rural communes, and some became teachers and barbers. Fourteen young people who went to the Nanchengzi Production Team have already had three become "Five-Good" commune members.
    Since the establishment of the Youth Home, we have mainly focused on the following tasks.
    Highlighting politics and diligently organizing young people to study Chairman Mao's writings, firmly grasping the education of a revolutionary world outlook. We organized young people to study articles such as "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and also organized them to study the deeds of Huang Jiguang, Dong Cunrui, Lei Feng, and Wang Jie. Aiming at the active thoughts of young people, we carried out special discussions on topics such as "What is the Future?" and "What is Happiness?" After studying these articles, young people generally reflected that their minds used to be filled with the word "I," such as wanting to find a good job, earn more money, and become famous. Now, there is more "public" in their minds and less "I," and they have initially established the idea of studying for the revolution and working for the revolution. Kong Qingchun, a young person who went to the countryside, studied Chairman Mao's writings and changed from being afraid of the hardship of the countryside to diligently learning agricultural work and actively learning common sense about using horses from old farmers. He took great care of horses and was selected as a "Model of Loving Horses." Since last year, twenty-eight people have joined the Communist Youth League.
    Educate young people to inherit the revolutionary traditions of the working class. The factory is a large classroom for educating young people, and the family histories of old workers and the fine qualities of the working class are living teaching materials for them to learn from. Targeting the active thoughts of young people, we invited "three olds" to tell the history of the factory, family histories, and revolutionary struggle histories. At the same time, we organized young people to participate in labor in the factory and listen to the recollections and comparisons of workers in the workshops. These young people saw and heard many moving deeds of old workers who wholeheartedly served the revolution, actively produced, and cherished state property, and they were greatly educated. When some young people first started working in the workshop, they were picky and unwilling to wear old work clothes. Later, under the education and influence of the workers, they not only wore old work clothes but also mended their own torn work clothes and scrambled to do heavy and dirty work.
    The Youth Home of our factory adheres to the principle of being mainly oriented towards the countryside. In order to meet the needs of the countryside, the Youth Home arranges for some young people to study carpentry, masonry, and mechanical repair. Some young people are assigned to the staff hospital to learn health care, and some are assigned to commercial and service industries to learn accounting and other work. At the same time, young people are also taught to write rural application documents, learn to use abacuses, keep accounts, and calculate areas and volumes. According to agricultural seasonal needs, they are organized to participate in labor in rural production teams. Last year, they concentrated on labor for eight days, delivering 80,000 jin of fertilizer and weeding and plowing 40 hectares of land. In early 1965, the Youth Home of our factory had already sent fifteen educated young people to participate in agricultural production. For young people who go to the countryside, the Youth Home adopts a responsible attitude to the end. Relevant leading cadres of the factory often visit them and help them solve some practical problems. This gives them great encouragement and makes them more determined to work in the countryside.
    The Party Committee of our factory attaches importance to the Youth Home. The Youth Home Management Committee is composed of the trade union, the Communist Youth League, and the family committee. A deputy factory director is mainly responsible for this matter, and a full-time cadre is also assigned to manage the work of the Youth Home. In addition, we also regularly conduct publicity and education to the families of employees, so that they understand that managing and educating young people is the responsibility of everyone.
    In the process of running the Youth Home, we have always adhered to the principles of self-reliance and thrift. The Youth Home does not have a fixed classroom. When class is in session, idle houses in the factory are temporarily borrowed. Teachers are recruited locally, and teaching supplies are all solved by the students' labor income.
    We still lack experience in running the Youth Home, and there are still many shortcomings. In the future, we will further strengthen the leadership of the Youth Home, enrich its strength, and run the Youth Home better.

    教育青少年人人有责
    牡丹江桦林橡胶厂党委会
    一九六四年，我厂成立了青少年之家，把全厂绝大部分未升学的中小学毕业生组织起来，按照他们的年龄、文化程度编成了三个中队，采取有工做工，无工学习的办法，一方面帮助他们学习政治、语文、数学等课程，另一方面组织他们到工厂、农村和服务行业参加生产劳动。许多学生通过政治学习和劳动锻炼，提高了阶级觉悟，增强了劳动观点，初步树立了为人民服务的思想。去年，有的学生到工厂当工人，有的到农村当社员，有的当了教师和理发员。到南城子生产队的十四名青年，已经有三人成了“五好”社员。
    成立青少年之家以来，我们主要抓以下几项工作。
    突出政治，认真组织青少年学习毛主席著作，狠抓革命世界观的教育。我们组织青少年学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章，还组织他们学习黄继光、董存瑞、雷锋、王杰的事迹，针对青少年的活思想，开展了“什么是前途”、“什么是幸福”等专题讨论。学了这些文章以后，青少年普遍反映，从前脑子里充满了
  “我”字，如要找好工作，要多挣钱，要出名等。现在，脑子里“公”字多了，“我”字少了，初步树立了为革命而学习，为革命而工作的思想。下乡青年孔庆春学习毛主席著作后，由怕农村苦，到苦学农活，主动向老农学习用马常识，他对马非常爱护，被选为“爱马模范”。去年以来，已有二十八人加入了共青团。
    教育青少年继承工人阶级的革命传统。工厂是教育青少年的大课堂，老工人的家史和工人阶级的优良品质是他们学习的活教材。针对青少年的活思想，我们请了“三老”讲厂史、家史、革命斗争史，同时组织青少年到工厂参加劳动，在车间听工人的回忆对比。这些青年人看到和听到许多老工人一心为革命，积极生产、爱护国家财产的动人事迹，受到很大教育。有的青年开始到车间劳动时，挑肥拣瘦，不愿意穿旧工作服。后来他们在工人的教育影响下，不但穿上了破旧的工作服，而且自己动手把破的工作服补好，也抢着干重活脏活了。
    我厂的青少年之家坚持面向农村为主的方针。为了适应农村的需要，青少年之家安排一部分青年学习木工、瓦工、机械检修等工种。有的青年被分配到职工医院学卫生保健工作，有的分配到商业和服务行业学习财会等工作。同时，还让青少年学会写农村应用文、学会打算盘、记账、计算面积和体积等。根据农业季节需要，组织他们到农村生产队去参加劳动。去年集中劳动八天，送肥八万斤，拔草铲地四十垧。一九六五年初，我厂青少年之家已输送了十五名知识青年参加了农业生产。对于下乡的青年，青少年之家采取负责到底的态度，工厂的有关领导干部，常常探望他们，帮助他们解决一些实际问题，这给他们很大的鼓舞，使他们更加坚定了在农村劳动的决心。
    我厂党委对青少年之家是重视的，由工会、共青团、家属委员会等组成了青少年之家管理委员会。有一位副厂长主要负责抓这件事，还配备了一位专职干部管青少年之家的工作。此外，我们还经常向职工家属进行宣传教育，使他们懂得管好教好青少年是每个人应尽的责任。
    在办青少年之家的过程中，我们始终坚持了自力更生、勤俭节约的原则，青少年之家没有固定的教室，上课时，临时借用厂里空闲的房子，教师是就地取材，教学用品都是以学生的劳动收入解决的。
    我们办青少年之家还缺乏经验，也存在不少缺点。今后要进一步加强对青少年之家的领导，充实力量，把青少年之家办得更好。
