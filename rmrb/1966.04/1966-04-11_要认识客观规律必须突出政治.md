    In just over a year, the Fuyang Special District of Anhui, an old disaster area, has escaped its difficult situation, transforming from severe food shortage to having surplus grain, and enabling the restoration and development of the collective economy, starting its turnaround. The Fuyang Special District provides a truth to all old disaster areas: emphasizing politics, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the broad masses of cadres and people, can help people understand the world, find the correct path to transform the world, and fully unleash the revolutionary power of the people to overcome serious natural disasters.
    The main experience of the Fuyang area in overcoming natural disasters is to follow the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong under the leadership of the Party, to mobilize the broad masses, to resolutely destroy the water-blocking projects built between provinces and regions, to break the feudal separatist situation of water management left over from the old society, to consider the upstream and downstream as a whole, to take overall account of all parties and from fundamental point of view to solve the problem of preventing waterlogging. This is a struggle against natural disasters, and even more so, a serious class struggle.
    Water flows downwards. To prevent waterlogging, we can only discharge water, which is what the comrades in Fuyang Special District call "letting the water go," and not blocking it. This is a very clear principle. However, because the feudal ruling class in the past adopted the practice of benefiting themselves at the expense of others, building dams to block water formed a stubborn habitual force, hindering people from recognizing this simple truth. Since liberation, although many methods for preventing waterlogging have been considered, one's vision was obscured, and it was impossible to see that building dams to block water not only did not alleviate waterlogging but became the main obstacle to preventing it. This kind of blindness made people lose the initiative in the face of the "realm of necessity," suffering from disasters for a long time without being able to extricate themselves. The Party discovered this problem and led the broad masses in a great struggle to promote proletarian ideas and eliminate bourgeois ones. The Party first educated Party members to break through the class limitations in their minds, making them realize that a member of the Chinese Communist Party must not only represent the interests of the people downstream, but also represent the interests of the people upstream, and even more so, represent the interests of the people of the whole country and the people of the whole world. The broad masses of Party members united and educated the broad masses, resolutely struggling against their own non-proletarian ideas and departmentalism, and against the old habitual forces. They took the initiative in letting the water go and thus gained the freedom to control the water. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Class struggle, once grasped, is effective." This sentence is not only fully applicable to solving political struggle and ideological struggle problems, but also fully applicable to solving the problem of how people correctly understand objective things. The struggle of the Fuyang area to overcome waterlogging is precisely that, first in people's minds, it broke through the class limitations of understanding the world, transformed the subjective world, opened the road from the "realm of necessity" to the "realm of freedom," and took a decisive step in eradicating water disasters and controlling waterlogging.
    The difficulties of the old disaster areas are serious. Can we rely on the local people to rely on their own efforts and overcome the disasters? If we do not go deep into the masses and conduct serious investigation and research, it is impossible to understand the actual situation of the disaster areas, and we will not believe that the masses have the ability to overcome the disasters. Because of this, some comrades regard the frequency of natural disasters and the weak foundation as the mainstream of the disaster areas, and dare not imagine changing the face of the disaster areas; they reach out to the higher levels for everything, wanting to rely on state relief to live their lives. The Party organization in Fuyang area, from long-term struggles against disasters, realized that the people in the disaster areas understand the causes and consequences of the disasters best, they have rich experience in struggle, and they have many practical methods for resisting disasters and eliminating harm. If we want to understand the objective reality of the disaster areas and transform the objective world of the disaster areas, we must earnestly learn from the masses, concentrate the struggle experience of the masses, and persist in it, so that it is possible to gain the freedom to overcome the disasters. The Party organization in Fuyang area relied on the people in the disaster areas to understand the laws of natural disasters, actively led the masses to launch a struggle against waterlogging, built a drainage system for the whole area, adopted different water management methods according to different terrains, and universally promoted the disaster-resistant measure of planting spring sweet potatoes, step by step towards victory. Of course, the situations in various disaster areas are different, and the disaster resistance experience of the masses in the disaster areas is not the same. The specific measures for water management and disaster resistance must be adapted to local conditions.
    Compared with general areas or even mildly affected areas, the specific difficulties in old disaster areas are numerous. How can we correctly understand and treat these difficulties? This requires a revolutionary determination to overcome all difficulties. In disaster areas, there are unfavorable factors, but there are also favorable factors. We must not only admit difficulties, but more importantly, we must give full play to favorable factors to overcome unfavorable factors, overcome difficulties, and change the face of the disaster areas. The more difficult it is, the more we must see the favorable conditions, the more we must see the role of people, and the more we must carry out arduous struggles. Only by correctly seeing the essence and mainstream of things can we truly understand the objective world and effectively transform the objective world. Comrade Jiao Yulu was like this, and the comrades in Fuyang Special District are also like this.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Freedom is the recognition of necessity and the transformation of the objective world." To understand the world and transform the world, we must rely on revolutionized people. Only by emphasizing politics and revolutionizing people's thinking can we correctly understand objective laws and victoriously advance the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. The Fuyang area's victory over waterlogging disasters in a relatively short period of time powerfully proves this point.

### 要认识客观规律必须突出政治

    要认识客观规律必须突出政治
    一年多的时间，一个老灾区——安徽阜阳专区就摆脱了困难状况，从严重缺粮变得有了余粮，并使集体经济得到恢复和发展，开始翻身了。阜阳专区向一切老灾区提供了一个真理，突出政治，用毛泽东思想武装广大干部和人民群众，就能帮助人们认识世界，找到改造世界的正确途径，充分发挥人民群众的革命力量，战胜严重的自然灾害。
    阜阳地区战胜自然灾害的主要经验，是在党的领导下，按照毛泽东同志的教导办事，发动广大群众，坚决平毁了省与省、地区与地区之间修筑的挡水工程，打破了旧社会遗留下来的治水的封建割据局面，上下游一盘棋，统筹兼顾，从根本上解决了防治内涝的一个问题。这是一场同自然灾害的斗争，更是一场严重的阶级斗争。
    水是往下流的，要防治内涝，只能泄水，也就是阜阳专区同志们所说的“让水”，而不能挡水。这本来是明明白白的道理。但是，由于封建统治阶级过去采取损人利己的做法，筑坝挡水形成了一种顽固的习惯势力，障碍了人们认识这个朴素的真理。解放以来，虽则想了许多防治内涝的办法，但是一叶障目，看不到筑坝挡水不但不能减轻涝灾，反而成为防治内涝的主要障碍。这种盲目性，使得人们在“必然王国”面前，丧失了主动，长期受灾而不能自拔。党发现了这个问题，领导广大群众开展一场兴无灭资的伟大斗争。党首先教育党员，打破头脑中的阶级局限性，使他们认识一个中国共产党党员，不但要代表下游人民的利益，还要代表上游人民的利益，更要代表全国人民、全世界人民的利益。广大党员团结和教育广大群众，坚决同自己的非无产阶级思想、本位主义思想作斗争，同旧的习惯势力作斗争。他们在让水中取得了主动，也就取得了治水的自由。毛泽东同志说，“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”这句话不仅对于解决政治斗争、思想斗争问题是完全适用的，对于解决人们如何正确认识客观事物的问题，也是完全适用的。阜阳地区战胜内涝的斗争，正是首先在人的头脑里，打破了认识世界的阶级局限性，改造了主观世界，给从“必然王国”通向“自由王国”打开了道路，迈出了根治水害、制服内涝的决定性的一步。
    老灾区的困难是严重的，能不能依靠当地人民群众，自力更生，战胜灾害呢？如果不深入群众，进行认真的调查研究，就不可能认识灾区的实际，也就不会相信群众有本领战胜灾害。正因为这样，有些同志把天灾多、底子薄，看作是灾区的主流，不敢设想改变灾区面貌；事事向上伸手，想靠国家救济过日子。阜阳地区的党组织，从长期同灾害作斗争中，认识到灾区人民最懂得灾害的来龙去脉，他们有丰富的斗争经验，有许多切合实际的抗灾除害办法。要想认识灾区的客观实际，改造灾区的客观世界，就必须认真向群众学习，把群众的斗争经验集中起来，坚持下去，才有可能取得战胜灾害的自由。阜阳地区党组织依靠灾区人民认识了自然灾害的规律，积极领导群众展开对内涝的斗争，建成了全区的排水系统，按照不同地势，采取不同的治水办法，并且普遍推广了种植春红薯的抗灾措施，一步步地走向了胜利。当然，各个灾区的情况是不同的，灾区群众的抗灾经验也不是一样的，治水抗灾的具体措施，都必须因地制宜。
    同一般地区甚至同轻灾区比较起来，老灾区的具体困难是很多的，怎样才能正确认识和对待这些困难呢？这就要有战胜一切困难的革命决心。在灾区，有不利因素，同样也存在有利因素。我们不但要承认困难，而且更重要的，是必须充分发挥有利因素，去克服不利因素，战胜困难，改变灾区面貌。越是困难，越要看到有利条件，越要看到人的作用，越要进行顽强的斗争。只有正确地看到事物的本质和主流，才能真正认识客观世界，才能有效地改造客观世界。焦裕禄同志是这样，阜阳专区的同志们也是这样。
    毛泽东同志说：“自由是对必然的认识和对客观世界的改造。”认识世界，改造世界，都要依靠革命化的人。只有突出政治，人的思想革命化了，才能正确认识客观规律，胜利地推进阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动。阜阳地区在较短的时间内战胜内涝灾害，有力地证明了这一点。
