    Xinhua News Agency, March 31st dispatch from Saigon: The people of the US-puppet controlled areas of South Vietnam's major cities have recently held a series of large-scale demonstrations against the United States and its South Vietnamese running dogs.

    According to Western news agencies, in Da Nang, a convoy carrying a group of demonstrators held an anti-American and anti-Nguyen Cao Ky puppet group demonstration in the city on the 30th. At this time, a U.S. Marine Corps vehicle recklessly tried to break up the demonstration convoy, and U.S. soldiers even beat some of the drivers in the convoy. This unbridled act of interference by the U.S. aggressors aroused great indignation among the demonstrators. Two thousand demonstrators immediately besieged a U.S. military dormitory. They demanded that Johnson personally issue a public apology for the U.S. military's interference in South Vietnam's internal affairs. Although the U.S. Consul in Da Nang, fearing the expansion of the situation, hurriedly came out to apologize, he still could not quell the anger of the demonstrators. The demonstrators issued an ultimatum to Johnson, demanding that he personally issue a public apology within 48 hours, otherwise the demonstrators would take further action.

    The struggle of the demonstrators in Da Nang immediately received the support of the people of Saigon. Saigon student organizations issued a statement on the same day condemning the barbaric behavior of the U.S. military in disrupting the demonstration. On the 31st, 3,000 people in Saigon held another large-scale anti-American demonstration. Banners held high by the demonstrators read: "Return Our Sovereignty!" "Vietnam Belongs Only to the Vietnamese!" "The United States Should Change Its Policy in Vietnam!"

    This struggle of the urban people in the South Vietnamese US-puppet controlled areas against the US-puppet group began in mid-March. On March 10th, Nguyen Cao Ky, with the support of his American masters, ousted Nguyen Chanh Thi, commander of the puppet First Army, thus triggering another infighting within the puppet group. After Nguyen Chanh Thi was ousted, some of his supporters organized demonstrations against Nguyen Cao Ky in Da Nang, Hue, and other places. The people of these cities also took the opportunity to launch a struggle against the Nguyen Cao Ky military dictatorship group. People from all walks of life in these cities continuously held demonstrations, parades, strikes, market strikes, and class boycotts, demanding that the Nguyen Cao Ky group step down. Some puppet military and police personnel also participated in the demonstrations. The scale of the struggle continued to expand, not only paralyzing these cities, but also gradually spreading to Saigon, the center of US-puppet rule. In this emergency, the U.S. "Ambassador" to South Vietnam, Lodge, personally intervened, attempting to ease the people's struggle and maintain the bloody rule of the Nguyen Cao Ky group. Nguyen Cao Ky also used both hard and soft tactics, on the one hand, expressing his intention to "accelerate the transition from military rule to a government elected according to the constitution," and on the other hand, threatening that if he were "pushed too hard," he would take "extraordinary and decisive measures." However, these tactics of the US-puppet group not only failed to deceive and soften the people's struggle, but also aroused greater anger among the broad masses of the people. According to Western news agencies, since March 23rd, large-scale anti-American demonstrations have repeatedly erupted in Da Nang, Hue, and other places. The demonstrators not only demanded that the Nguyen Cao Ky group step down, but also "anti-American sentiments are getting higher and higher." They shouted anti-American slogans, opposed American interference in internal affairs, and opposed the puppet group's obedience to the United States. On the 23rd, 10,000 people participated in a demonstration in Hue, and on the 27th, 20,000 people took to the streets to demonstrate. Da Nang citizens held general market strikes and strikes on the 23rd and 24th, closing 95% of the city's shops. Many workers working at the Da Nang U.S. military base also stopped working. The dockworkers' strike made it impossible for some ships to unload. Students in Da Nang and Hue also seized the local radio stations for a time to conduct anti-American and anti-Nguyen Cao Ky group broadcasts. Buddhists in Saigon held demonstrations and rallies on the 27th and 28th. Catholics also announced on the 29th that they wanted the Nguyen Cao Ky group to step down.

    Faced with the increasingly strong resistance of the broad masses of the people, the U.S. aggressors and their running dogs have once again fallen into a predicament. Western news agencies said that U.S. officials in Saigon admitted that the political situation in South Vietnam "has reached a crisis stage" and that they are "watching the development of the situation with uneasy minds." The Nguyen Cao Ky group is even more panicked, fearing both being overthrown by the people and being replaced by their American masters. According to the Associated Press, Nguyen Cao Ky on the 30th had "ordered two battalions of paratroopers to Saigon as reserves" and ordered the paratroopers to deploy around the Saigon radio station to prevent "trouble."

    美帝国主义在政治战线上也遭到惨败
    岘港顺化西贡爆发反美大示威
    示威群众高呼“还我主权！”并限约翰逊两天内公开道歉
    新华社三十一日讯　西贡消息：南越美伪统治区各主要城市的人民最近举行了反对美国和它的南越走狗的一系列大示威。
    据西方通讯社报道，在岘港，一支车队载着一批示威群众三十日在市内举行反对美国和阮高其傀儡集团的示威，这时，一辆美国海军陆战队的汽车横冲直撞企图冲散这支示威的车队，美国兵还殴打了这支车队的一些司机。美国侵略者的这种肆无忌惮的干涉行动，激起了示威群众的极大愤慨。两千名示威群众立即把一座美军宿舍包围得水泄不通。他们要求约翰逊亲自就美军这种干涉南越内政的行为公开道歉。尽管美国驻岘港领事害怕事态扩大，急忙出来道歉，但是仍无法平息示威群众的愤怒，示威群众向约翰逊发出了最后通牒，要他在四十八小时内亲自公开道歉，否则示威者将采取进一步的行动。
    岘港示威群众的斗争，立即得到了西贡市人民的支持。西贡学生组织在当天发表声明，谴责美军破坏示威的野蛮行为。三十一日，西贡市三千人又举行了大规模的反美示威。示威群众高举的横幅上写着：“还我主权！”“越南只属于越南！”“美国应当改变它在越南的政策！”
    这次南越美伪统治区城市人民反对美伪集团的斗争，是从三月中旬开始的。三月十日，阮高其在他的美国主子支持下，把伪第一军军长阮正诗赶下台，从而触发了傀儡集团又一次内讧。阮正诗被赶下台后，他的一些支持者即在岘港、顺化等地组织反对阮高其的示威。这些城市的人民也乘机群起展开反对阮高其军事独裁集团的斗争。这些城市的各阶层人民不断举行示威游行、罢工、罢市和罢课，要阮高其集团下台。部分伪军警人员也参加了示威。斗争的规模不断扩大，不仅使这些城市陷于瘫痪，并且逐渐蔓延到美伪统治的中心西贡。在这种紧急情况下，美国驻南越“大使”洛奇亲自插手干预，妄图使群众的斗争缓和下来，保住阮高其集团的血腥统治。阮高其也软硬兼施，一方面表示要“加速从军事统治向根据宪法选举的政府过渡”，一方面又扬言如果“逼他太甚”，他将采取“非常的断然措施”。但是美伪集团的这些手段，不仅未能欺骗和软化人民的斗争，反而更激起了广大人民的怒火。据西方通讯社报道，从三月二十三日以来，岘港、顺化等地又接连爆发了大规模的反美示威，示威群众不但要阮高其集团下台，而且“反美调子越来越高”，他们高呼反美口号，反对美国干涉内政，反对傀儡集团听命于美国。二十三日，顺化有一万人参加了示威，二十七日又有两万人上街示威。岘港市民在二十三日和二十四日举行了总罢市和罢工，使全市百分之九十五的商店关了门，在岘港美军基地工作的许多工人也停止上工。码头工人的罢工使一些轮船无法卸货。岘港和顺化的学生还一度夺取了当地的电台，进行反美和反阮高其集团的广播。西贡市的佛教徒在二十七日和二十八日举行了示威和集会。天主教徒也在二十九日宣布要阮高其集团下台。
    面对着广大人民日益强烈的反抗，美国侵略者及其走狗又一次陷入困境。西方通讯社说，西贡的美国官员承认，南越的政治局势“已经到了危机阶段”，他们“正以不安的心情注视事态的发展”。阮高其集团更是惊惶不安，既害怕被人民推翻，又怕美国主子换马。据美联社报道，阮高其三十日已“下令把两营伞兵开到西贡作为后备”，并且命令伞兵在西贡电台周围布防，预防“麻烦”。
