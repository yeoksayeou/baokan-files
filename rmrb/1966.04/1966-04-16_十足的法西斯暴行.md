    Outright Fascist Violence
    On April 15th, Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces, organized a group of thugs, under the cover of the army, using trucks and armored vehicles to break open the gates of the Chinese Embassy in Jakarta, entered the embassy, and wantonly carried out sabotage, arson, assaulted our diplomatic officials, and opened fire wounding our embassy personnel. This blatant act by Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces is rare in the history of international relations. The Chinese people express their strongest indignation and most serious protest against this.
    The Chinese Embassy in Jakarta is the fully empowered representative body of the People's Republic of China stationed in Indonesia. Like the embassies of any country, it enjoys sacred and inviolable rights. However, the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces gathered thugs, broke into the Chinese Embassy, and arbitrarily carried out sabotage and assault. This is a serious infringement upon the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China.
    The Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces are acting perversely and lawlessly at home. Now, they have thrown the most basic principles of international law to the winds. Only Hitler's bandits could do such a thing. The actions of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces prove that they are a gang of out-and-out fascists.
    The rampant anti-China activities of Indonesian right-wing forces are inseparable from their reactionary policies of anti-communism and anti-people at home. For more than half a year, while Indonesian reactionary forces have been slaughtering revolutionary people and communists on a large scale and frantically persecuting patriotic and progressive forces, they have increasingly arrogantly carried out anti-China and anti-Chinese activities. They have repeatedly attacked Chinese embassies and consulates in Indonesia, persecuted and even slaughtered our overseas Chinese with extremely barbaric means, and unreasonably closed the Jakarta branch of the Xinhua News Agency. Regarding these incidents, our government has repeatedly lodged strong protests with the Indonesian authorities through normal diplomatic channels, and demanded that they take effective measures to stop the brutal behavior that is worsening the relations between the two countries. However, the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces have not only ignored our solemn warnings, but have intensified their anti-China activities, and even openly attacked and destroyed the Chinese Embassy in Jakarta. This shows that they are deliberately pushing the diplomatic relations between China and Indonesia to the point of rupture.
    Why are the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces so hateful and hostile to China?
    The Chinese people have always held high the banner of opposing imperialism and new and old colonialism, and resolutely support the just struggles of the people of all countries. It is precisely because of this that imperialism and reactionaries of all countries hate China to the core. The Indonesian reactionaries are of course no exception. The Indonesian people are friendly to the Chinese people. The patriotic and progressive forces of Indonesia are also friendly to the Chinese people. Since the right-wing forces are enemies of the Indonesian people and patriotic and progressive forces, they will of course attack China, slander China, and even resort to naked violence in an attempt to undermine the friendship between the two peoples. This is out of their reactionary class nature and is not surprising.
    A small group of Indonesian right-wing military personnel and reactionary politicians are essentially agents of imperialism. The counter-revolutionary military coup they launched was carried out under the planning of U.S. imperialism and Japanese reactionaries. After they completed their entire conspiracy to usurp power, they were bound to completely change Indonesia's foreign policy. Recently, while they have been rampantly engaging in anti-China activities, they have been clamoring to "improve relations with the United States." This attack and destruction of the Chinese Embassy shows that they have openly thrown themselves into the arms of imperialism headed by the United States and its accomplices, and joined their chorus of anti-communism, anti-China, and anti-people.
    We want to warn the Indonesian reactionaries that the Chinese people are not to be trifled with. We do not take U.S. imperialism seriously when it uses economic blockade, political isolation, and military encirclement to deal with China, let alone you clowns! The more you are anti-China, the more you expose your reactionary faces. The Indonesian right-wing forces have internally bloodbathed the archipelago and externally unleashed a hysterical anti-China frenzy. Their counter-revolutionary actions have reached their peak. But this is also the time when they begin to decline. All anti-China heroes in the world have never had a good ending. The Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces will be no exception.

### 十足的法西斯暴行

    十足的法西斯暴行
    四月十五日，印度尼西亚右派反动势力组织一批暴徒，在陆军掩护下，以卡车、装甲车冲开中国驻雅加达大使馆的大门，进入使馆内部，大肆进行破坏，放火行凶，打伤我外交官员，开枪打伤我使馆人员。印度尼西亚右派反动势力这种猖狂行径，在国际关系史上是罕见的。中国人民对此表示最强烈的愤慨和最严重的抗议。
    中国驻雅加达的使馆，是中华人民共和国派驻印度尼西亚的全权代表机关。它同任何一个国家的驻外使馆一样，享有神圣不可侵犯的权利。而印度尼西亚右派反动势力竟然纠集暴徒，闯进中国大使馆，恣意进行破坏和行凶。这是对中华人民共和国主权的严重侵犯。
    印度尼西亚右派反动势力对内倒行逆施，无法无天。现在，他们又把最起码的国际法准则抛之于九霄云外。这种行径，只有希特勒匪徒才能干得出来。印度尼西亚右派反动势力的所作所为，证明他们是一伙不折不扣的法西斯分子。
    印度尼西亚右派势力猖狂反华，是同他们对内反共、反人民的反动政策分不开的。半年多来，印度尼西亚反动势力在大肆屠杀革命人民和共产党人、疯狂迫害爱国进步力量的同时，越来越嚣张地进行了反华和排华活动。他们不断地袭击中国驻印度尼西亚的使领馆，以无比野蛮的手段迫害甚至屠杀我国侨民，无理封闭新华社驻雅加达分社。对这些事件，我国政府通过正常的外交途径，一再地向印度尼西亚当局提出了强烈抗议，并要求他们采取有效措施，停止恶化两国关系的粗暴行为。但是，印度尼西亚右派反动势力不仅不顾我国的严正警告，反而变本加厉地进行反华，甚至公然袭击和破坏中国驻雅加达大使馆。这表明，他们蓄意要把中国和印度尼西亚两国的外交关系推向破裂。
    为什么印度尼西亚右派反动势力对中国这么仇恨和敌视呢？
    中国人民一贯高举反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的旗帜，坚决支持各国人民的正义斗争。正是因为这样，帝国主义和各国反动派，都对中国恨之入骨。印度尼西亚反动派当然也是如此。印度尼西亚人民同中国人民是友好的。印度尼西亚的爱国进步力量同中国人民也是友好的。右派势力既然同印度尼西亚人民和爱国进步力量为敌，当然要攻击中国，诬蔑中国，甚至不惜以赤裸裸的暴力手段，力图破坏两国人民的友谊。这是出于他们反动的阶级本性，是毫不奇怪的。
    一小撮印度尼西亚右派军人和反动政客，本来就是帝国主义的代理人。他们发动的反革命军事政变，就是在美帝国主义和日本反动派的策划下进行的。当他们完成了篡夺政权的全部阴谋计划以后，就必然要彻底改变印度尼西亚的对外政策。最近，他们一方面猖狂地进行反华，一方面叫嚷要“改善同美国的关系”。这次对中国大使馆的袭击和破坏，表明他们已公开地投入以美国为首的帝国主义及其帮凶们的怀抱，参加了他们反共、反华、反人民的大合唱。
    我们要警告印度尼西亚反动派，中国人民并不是好惹的。美帝国主义用经济封锁、政治孤立、军事包围来对付中国，我们都不把它放在眼里，何况你们这一群跳梁小丑！你们越是反华，越是暴露你们的反动面目。印度尼西亚右派势力，对内血洗了千岛之国，对外放肆地发作反华歇斯底里。他们的反革命行径，已经发展到了顶点。但是，这也是他们开始走下坡路的时候了。世界上所有的反华英雄，从来都没有好下场。印度尼西亚右派反动势力，也决不会例外。
