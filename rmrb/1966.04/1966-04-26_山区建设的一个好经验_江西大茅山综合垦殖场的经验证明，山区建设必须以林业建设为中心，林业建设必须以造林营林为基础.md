    A Good Experience in Mountain Area Construction
    The experience of the Jiangxi Damaoshan Comprehensive Reclamation Farm proves that mountain area construction must focus on forestry construction, and forestry construction must be based on afforestation and forest management.
      The state-owned Jiangxi Damaoshan Comprehensive Reclamation Farm, under the guidance of the idea of basing everything on forest management, has adopted a number of revolutionary measures in recent years, vigorously grasping afforestation and forest management work, so that renewal has kept up with felling, and a large area of barren hills has been afforested. Both forestry and agricultural production have shown a vigorous and thriving situation.
    Walking into this reclamation farm, one can see that on horizontal belts around the mountains, in neat fish-scale pits, grow various saplings, mainly Chinese fir. The Chinese fir trees planted a few years ago have already closed into forests, and the newly planted saplings are also verdant and lush. The reclamation farm's pace-setter in barren hill afforestation, the Wangshan Forest Farm, has planted over 6,700 mu of forest in the past six years, of which more than 5,200 mu are Chinese fir timber forests. The 500-plus mu of Chinese fir forest planted in 1960 has trees that are over eight meters tall, with the thickest having a diameter at breast height of twelve centimeters.
    From the winter of 1962, the Damaoshan Reclamation Farm, in just over three years, afforested over 32,000 mu, equivalent to 4.6 times the area of preserved afforestation in the previous five years, and equal to twice the area felled in the eight years since the farm was established. These newly planted saplings have a survival rate of 98.3 percent; a survival rate of over 90 percent; and growth (according to a survey last autumn), taking the dominant tree species, Chinese fir, as an example, those planted in 1963 averaged 1.4 meters in height, those planted in 1964 averaged 86 centimeters, and those planted in 1965 had an average new shoot growth of 26 centimeters, with the fastest reaching 43 centimeters. It is estimated that in another fifteen years, these newly planted fir forests can begin to be felled for timber. According to the farm's forestry development plan, the area of afforestation and renewal will be around 10,000 mu each year in the future. In this way, in twenty years, calculated at an annual felling of 6,000 mu and a yield of 15 cubic meters of timber per mu, 90,000 cubic meters of timber can be transferred to the state each year, equivalent to 5.2 times the amount transferred this year, and can be felled on a fifty-year rotation. If this is persisted in, the farm's forestry production can completely realize the requirements of felling more and better, sustainable operations, and evergreen mountains.
    The farm's grain production and diversified management have also developed rapidly. Grain production has increased significantly every year. Last year, it increased by 24.9 percent on top of the 9.6 percent increase the year before, of which over 186,000 jin of grain were harvested from forest-grain intercropping. The unit area yield of grain on over 9,000 mu of paddy fields has rapidly increased from 364 jin in 1962 to 719 jin.

        Repeated Practice, Repeated Understanding, Repeated Struggle to Establish the Idea of Forest Management as the Foundation
    Revolutionary methods come from revolutionary ideas, and revolutionary ideas come from revolutionary practice. The staff and workers of the Damaoshan Reclamation Farm adhere to putting politics first, creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and constantly summarize experiences and lessons in practice, constantly creating and advancing.
    Forestry production and construction must be based on forest management. This is a requirement of the objective laws of forestry production. However, because forest management is a long-term production and it is not easy to see results in a short period of time, while felling is a current-year production and benefits can be obtained quickly. Therefore, people are often easily misled by temporary immediate interests and forget the fundamental task of forest management. The Damaoshan Reclamation Farm went through repeated practice, repeated understanding, and repeated struggle to establish the idea of basing everything on forest management.
    In the early stage of construction, from 1958 to the first half of 1960, they focused their main efforts on grasping mountain industry and sideline production, which was of great significance for quickly settling down, supporting long-term development with short-term gains, and accumulating funds. However, after settlement-oriented production came to an end and current-year production steadily increased, they did not shift the focus of production to forestry production in a timely manner, but continued to use the accumulation of industry and sideline production to expand the reproduction of industry and sideline production. Some units, in order to grasp more income, indiscriminately felled trees. As a result, in terms of forest management, there was a phenomenon of planting more, managing less, and surviving even less. From the second half of 1960 to the first half of 1962, there was also a phenomenon of destroying forests for grain production while grasping grain production. Seeing that the mountainous forest resources were decreasing day by day, not only did the local commune members have opinions, but some workers and cadres also felt that the reclamation farm had no future.
    This situation required the reclamation farm's Party committee to answer: What is the fundamental purpose of the state in establishing reclamation farms in mountainous areas? What guiding ideology should be established? How can the guiding ideology be implemented?
    In order to answer these important questions, the reclamation farm's Party committee convened an enlarged meeting of the Party committee in Wufengdong on July 1, 1962. In the spirit of self-revolution, it analyzed the achievements since the establishment of the farm in a realistic manner, and criticized the tendencies of emphasizing felling over planting and emphasizing grain over forestry. The cadres at all levels who attended the meeting spoke freely, using a large number of facts to expose the errors in the guiding ideology of management and the resulting bad consequences. Everyone first calculated two accounts:
    The first account was the ratio of mountains and fields: the farm had a total of 500,000 mu of mountains and forests (including 400,800 mu of forests and 99,200 mu of barren hills), and more than 15,000 mu of basic cultivated land (including more than 7,400 mu of paddy fields). Calculated by the average total population of the farm, each person had 25 mu of mountains and forests and 7.5 li of cultivated land. After this calculation, everyone felt that in such a reclamation farm with more mountains and less fields, grasping grain production was of course very important, but if only fields were grasped and not mountains, and only grain was grasped and not forestry, the production in the mountainous areas could not be fully developed, and it would not be possible to adapt well to the needs of national construction and people's lives.
      The second account was the felling account: from 1958 to 1962, the farm felled a total of 132,000 cubic meters of timber, averaging more than 26,000 cubic meters per year. Due to the emphasis on felling over planting and the emphasis on planting over management, although more than 47,000 mu of forest were planted in five years, only more than 6,000 mu were actually preserved. If this continued, all the total timber reserves of the farm would be felled in another thirty years. After this calculation, everyone at the meeting was shocked and realized that if the current practice continued, it would lead to the situation that the masses criticized as "sitting and eating the mountains empty, and the mountains running out of water."
    Then, everyone discussed the relationship between forestry and agriculture, citing contrasting facts: the Chongxi and Rao'er branch farms and nearby communes, due to the dense forests, had relatively harmonious climate and rainfall, and were basically free from drought and flood, and agricultural production was stable year after year; on the contrary, in the Fuquanshan branch farm and nearby communes with fewer forests and more barren hills, soil erosion was relatively serious, and they suffered from varying degrees of drought and flood almost every year, and agricultural production was not stable enough. Everyone realized that agriculture and forestry are interdependent and indispensable. If forestry is neglected while running agriculture, it will not only be impossible to do a good job in agriculture, but it will also directly hinder the development of agricultural production. Furthermore, grain and oil products such as chestnuts, dates and other woody grains and oil tea and other woody oil crops can be directly obtained from the development of forestry production.
    After such full exposure and analysis of contradictions, everyone clearly realized that the fundamental purpose of the state in establishing reclamation farms in mountainous areas is to build the mountainous areas into permanent socialist forestry bases. To this end, it is necessary to firmly establish the idea of basing everything on forest management (at that time called "taking forest management as the main thing"), vigorously grasp afforestation and forest management, and develop forestry production. If we continue to only eat the mountains without nurturing them as in the past, we will not only fail to build the mountains well, but also be unable to build farms and settle down in the mountains for a long time.

    Re-understanding the Experience of Wangshan Forest Farm in Combining Agriculture and Forestry to Build a New Forestry Base with Greater, Faster, Better and More Economical Results
    The reclamation farm's Longtoushan branch farm has a Wangshan Forest Farm. From the time it was established in the winter of 1959, the staff and workers of this forest farm, in the absence of food, funds, and afforestation experience, were determined to transform the 12,000-plus mu of poor mountains covered with cogongrass into rich mountains with lush trees in the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains. More than 50 staff and workers of the entire forest farm, regardless of wind, snow and severe cold, ate on the mountain top and lived on the mountain top, cutting cogongrass and digging up its roots, and preparing the land completely. Without seedlings, they went to the mountains dozens of miles away to collect fir branches; without technology, they humbly learned from the local veteran forest farmers; without a mu of basic cultivated land and without development funds, they vigorously grasped short-term gains to support long-term development and implemented rational intercropping of saplings and crops, with an annual total income of 556 yuan. After three consecutive years of hard work and practical work, they finally transformed more than 1,100 mu of cogongrass barren hills, planted fir forests, and realized self-sufficiency in grain and money with a surplus. According to a check at the end of 1962, the newly planted fir forest planted in 1960 averaged 2.3 meters in height, with a survival rate of 92 percent.
    This method of combining agriculture and forestry in Wangshan Forest Farm can also be carried out by units of collective ownership, and it is especially worth emulating by those places with few fields, many people, and many mountains. However, the reclamation farm's Party committee initially only regarded it as a general advanced unit and did not see its important significance. After the Wufengdong meeting, because the idea of basing everything on forest management was very clear, and after in-depth investigation, the Party committee realized that Wangshan Forest Farm was a clear banner for barren hill afforestation, and vigorously promoting Wangshan's experience could quickly eliminate the more than 80,000 mu of cogongrass barren hills that were most likely to cause mountain forest fires, and could turn poor mountains into rich mountains and build new forestry bases with greater, faster, better and more economical results. Therefore, through various forms, they vigorously publicized and promoted Wangshan's advanced experience, and called on the staff and workers of the entire farm to learn from their high sense of responsibility and dedication in building new socialist mountainous areas; to learn from their revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance in afforestation and forest management; to learn from their long-term perspective and advanced experience of "combining long-term and short-term, supporting long-term development with short-term gains" and "intercropping forests and grains, with forests as the main thing"; and to learn from their working methods of the mass line of "leadership, veteran forest farmers, and masses" in production struggles and scientific experiments.
    Once the experience of Wangshan barren hill afforestation was promoted, it quickly set off a high tide of afforestation throughout the reclamation farm to march towards cogongrass barren hills. Cadres at all levels led the workers and masses to set up camps on the mountains, braving the wind, snow and severe cold to prepare the land and plant forests. In order to achieve "three highs" in afforestation (high survival rate, high preservation rate, and high growth rate), the forest farms not only strictly complied with the afforestation technical regulations during afforestation, but also insisted on replanting and tending after afforestation. Workers from the Dongkeng, Panjia, and Baolinshan forest farms took off their cotton clothes to cover the seedlings to be used to ensure that the roots were moist. Workers from Yecun and Lukou forest farms, in order to promote rapid growth and high yield of newly planted saplings, took the initiative to carry pig manure and fire soil ash to the mountains as base fertilizer. After afforestation, the Xiaomaoshan Forest Farm encountered drought and some seedlings died. The workers insisted on replanting, once, twice, and three times, and finally made the survival rate of fir trees reach more than 90 percent that year. After such arduous struggle, more and more barren hills were afforested, and they were afforested better and better. From 1963 to 1965, the farm afforested more than 20,000 mu on barren hills.

    Inspiration from the Revolution of the Horseshoe Bay Logging Method to Dialectically Handle the Relationship Between Forest Harvesting and Renewal
    After barren hill afforestation was launched, the reclamation farm's Party committee further analyzed the current situation of the farm's forestry production: in the 500,000 mu of mountains and forests, there were more than 400,000 mu of forests and more than 90,000 mu of barren hills. This showed that in the management of the entire forest area, the existing forests were a major part. Only by doing a good job in the harvesting and renewal of existing forests can sustainable operations and evergreen mountains be realized. At that time, harvesting and renewal were the weakest link of the Damaoshan Reclamation Farm, so it must be grasped and grasped well, that is, the relationship between harvesting and renewal must be properly handled.
    There was a mountain site called Horseshoe Bay in Nanxi Forest Farm, which was a sparse and dilapidated forest overgrown with miscellaneous shrubs, with a total of 62 mu. In the autumn of 1960, the Party branch of this forest farm considered that only by cutting down all these sparse residual forests and implementing artificial renewal could the forest appearance of this mountain site be completely changed and the rapid growth and high yield of the next generation of trees could be promoted. After discussing and studying with the staff and workers, all the trees on this mountain site were cut down, and in the spring of 1961, fir trees were planted, tung trees were planted, and grain was intercropped. At that time, the leaders of the reclamation farm repeatedly criticized this felling method, believing that this "shaving the head" was wrong. However, the criterion for testing truth is practice. By the autumn of 1963, the newly planted fir saplings on the Horseshoe Bay mountain site generally grew vigorously, and the interplanted tung trees also began to bear fruit. The situation in Henggang Forest Farm and other places also proved that the saplings in the mountain sites that adopted the same felling and renewal method as Horseshoe Bay grew very well.
    Was the felling method of the Horseshoe Bay mountain site really wrong? The leaders of the reclamation farm had to rethink this question and finally realized that the so-called "shaving the head" felling method that had been repeatedly criticized in the past was actually the correct small-scale clear-cutting. The practice of the Horseshoe Bay mountain site was a sign of revolution in the felling method. This was completely different from the "shaving the head" of destroying forests for grain production. The past blanket opposition to "shaving the head" objectively provided cover for indiscriminate felling of "grabbing strong men" (picking only the best trees to cut). At that time, in order to complete the task of timber transfer, many forest farms, under the name of not "shaving the head," went into the mountains to "grab strong men"—"old ones are not wanted, small ones are not wanted, bent ones are not wanted, sick ones are not wanted," only picking the best trees to cut. As a result, the forest farms that were originally secondary forests became sparser and sparser, and the rich mountains that originally had standard timber became poor mountains of "seeing green mountains from afar but no mature timber up close." The masses criticized this as "weasels stealing chickens, stealing more and more sparsely," making the mountain sites "old ones are old, small ones are small, and the young and strong are gone."
    The method of small-scale clear-cutting and "shaving the head" felling and renewal like the Horseshoe Bay mountain site seemed to be starting from scratch, costing more labor and yielding slower results. In fact, compared with the usual method of planting trees in holes, small-scale clear-cutting requires more labor at the beginning, but it greatly saves labor later. They compared the two. Small-scale clear-cutting generally requires 8.7 workdays per mu for land preparation and afforestation. Because there are not many miscellaneous shrubs and weeds, two tending sessions a year only require three workdays; it only takes three years to close, a total of nine workdays, totaling 17.8 workdays. Planting trees in holes requires only four workdays per mu at the beginning, but there are many miscellaneous shrubs and weeds, and two tending sessions a year require six workdays, and it takes five years to tend, a total of thirty workdays. If one tending session is carried out every year, five years also require fifteen workdays, plus afforestation, a total of 19 workdays; the subsequent felling and transportation are more difficult and labor-intensive than the former. At the same time, the former is less prone to fire due to fewer miscellaneous shrubs and weeds, and protection is also more convenient; the latter is the opposite. In particular, the former can be appropriately planted densely, such as 300 to 400 fir trees per mu, with a high survival rate, fast growth rate, and large output of timber. Mid-term can be thinned, so that long-term income has short-term income, and it can also ensure that within 15 to 20 years, 15 to 20 cubic meters of mature timber with a diameter at breast height of 22 to 24 centimeters can be produced per mu. Generally, planting trees in holes in the shrub bushes even if the saplings grow normally, it takes 20 to 25 years to mature. In this way, only 30 to 40 to 100-odd trees can be planted per mu, and at most less than 200 trees. Due to the low survival rate, only 3 to 10 cubic meters of mature timber can be produced per mu. Comparing all aspects, the practice of the Horseshoe Bay mountain site seems stupid, but is actually clever; seems slow, but is actually fast; seems laborious, but is actually labor-saving; seems like a loss, but is actually a gain; seems like there are few trees, but there are actually many trees.
    The iron-like facts and specific analysis educated the leading cadres of the reclamation farm. They deeply felt that although the starting point of the past criticism of the Horseshoe Bay mountain site was to protect national forest resources, the actual effect was to stifle the growth of new things; if they did not openly admit their mistakes, backward things would continue to be preserved and developed, and it would be impossible to carry out a revolution in the felling method, and it would be impossible to correctly handle the relationship between felling and renewal. After a fierce ideological revolution, the leading cadres of the reclamation farm admitted to the staff and workers of the entire farm that the past criticism of the Horseshoe Bay mountain site was wrong, affirmed that the felling method of the Horseshoe Bay mountain site was correct and must be promoted; and pointed out that the felling method of "grabbing strong men" was the most concealed and most serious indiscriminate felling and must be resolutely stopped.
    From then on, the entire farm regarded whether reasonable felling was carried out and whether renewal kept up with felling as an important yardstick for measuring whether they were responsible for the revolutionary work. Everyone also further improved their understanding of the combination of harvesting and cultivation through continuous summarization in subsequent production practices, and created many methods of combining harvesting and cultivation. In the past, everyone only understood that felling was the purpose and renewal was the means, and renewal was for felling; later, in connection with the actual situation of the farm's many secondary forests and low yields per unit area, they conducted investigations and research and realized that in order to change the forest appearance and increase the yield per unit area, it was necessary to regard felling as a means and renewal as the purpose. Felling and renewal are actually mutually means and mutually purpose. Only by completely understanding the relationship between the two can we achieve better renewal through felling and more felling through renewal. In this way, the original slogan of "combining felling and renewal" and "renewal must keep up with felling" was developed into "felling must proceed from being conducive to renewal, and renewal must keep up with felling, so that forest resources surpass each generation", so that the idea of "basing everything on forest management" became more active and clear. According to the principle of adapting to local conditions and being conducive to renewal, in terms of felling methods, they advocated small-scale clear-cutting as the main method; on the other hand, for mountain sites with steeper slopes and prone to soil erosion, and for mountain sites with natural renewal conditions (such as those with many young trees, leaving Masson pine parent trees can form forests by flying seeds), they implemented a combination of felling and cultivation. In terms of renewal methods, they advocated artificial renewal as the main method; on the other hand, for mountain sites with natural renewal conditions, they implemented artificial promotion of natural renewal. In this way, they proceeded from reality everywhere and adopted flexible methods to correctly solve a series of contradictions in the combination of harvesting and cultivation.

    Improving the Quality of Afforestation and Forest Management Must Highlight Politics
        The Implementation of the System Must Rely on the Revolutionary Consciousness of the Masses
    The Damaoshan Reclamation Farm planted tens of thousands of mu of forest before 1962, basically "planting forests every year but not seeing forests every year." Most of the saplings that were barely preserved grew very slowly. Why did this happen? From the afforestation work itself, the main reason was that the policy of quality first was not implemented. After the Wufengdong meeting in 1962, they seriously summarized the experience and lessons of afforestation and forest management in the previous years and realized that in afforestation, without quality, there is no quantity, and if quality is not emphasized, it will waste manpower and financial resources and lose the purpose and significance of afforestation. Only by grasping quality can we achieve the goal of more afforestation, more survival, faster growth, and more timber output.
    In the past few years, in order to improve the quality of afforestation and forest management, they have paid great attention to highlighting politics, creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, implementing democratic management, improving the workers' understanding of the future of mountainous areas and their thinking of being masters of their own affairs, and establishing the system of implementing the quality of afforestation and forest management on the basis of the revolutionary consciousness of the masses. At the same time, they have accumulated a set of experiences in doing a good job in the quality of afforestation and forest management. These experiences can be summarized as "one high" and "two insistences." One high is the high standard of afforestation quality, and the two insistences are insistence on replanting after afforestation and insistence on tending.
    Insisting on high afforestation quality standards mainly involves grasping the five basic measures of suitable tree species for the site, meticulous land preparation, selection of strong seedlings, application of fertile soil to the planting hole, and loosening the roots. Suitable tree species for the site means adapting to local conditions and planting what is suitable for the mountain and not emphasizing "uniformity." Meticulous land preparation does not necessarily mean full cultivation. The method of land preparation should be comprehensively considered based on factors such as the mountain site, labor force, funds, and time. Generally speaking, mountain sites with a slope of less than 25 degrees can be fully cultivated, and mountain sites with a slope of more than 25 degrees and less than 35 degrees are best cultivated with horizontal strips or a combination of horizontal strips and pit cultivation. However, if labor, time and other conditions permit, full cultivation can be carried out first, followed by building horizontal strips. The advantage of building horizontal strips is that they can play a role in maintaining water and soil in the current year and facilitate operations and intercropping of saplings. Mountain sites with a slope of more than 35 degrees are strictly prohibited from full cultivation and can only be cultivated with fish-scale pits. Applying fertile soil to the planting hole means separating the topsoil and subsoil when digging large holes and filling the topsoil into the hole before planting the tree, and then scraping the topsoil around the hole into the hole. This is a good way to solve the problem of applying base fertilizer to large-scale afforestation by using local materials.
    Insisting on replanting means insisting on replanting one seedling for every missing seedling in the first two years of newly planted saplings. Only in this way can one mu be planted, one mu survive, and one mu be preserved. Insisting on tending means that tending must be done after planting, and tending must be done well. The method of tending should not emphasize full weeding, because this method of tending is both labor-intensive and detrimental to water and soil conservation. For mountain sites with horizontal strip cultivation and land preparation, full cutting and strip weeding are adopted. For mountain sites with pit cultivation and land preparation, full cutting and pit weeding are adopted, or horizontal strips are gradually formed through full cutting and strip weeding. Strip weeding means weeding and loosening the soil on the planting rows of horizontal strips or pit cultivation; the weeds between the strips are not weeded to facilitate water and soil conservation and increase green manure resources. In this way, what should be thick is thick and what should be thin is thin. The quality is better and the labor is saved more than full weeding.

      "Forest" Comes First, Sapling Intercropping, Multiple Benefits in One Move
    The practice of the Damaoshan Reclamation Farm in recent years has proved that as long as we adhere to putting "forest" first, intercropping in sapling land can achieve multiple benefits in one move. First of all, the number of tending sessions is increased, which can accelerate the growth of saplings; secondly, the utilization rate of mountain land is improved, which can harvest a large amount of grain, oil and other products, and realize short-term gains to support long-term development; thirdly, tending is used instead of cultivation, one workday has double benefits, costs are reduced, and labor is saved. Now, the farm has increasingly realized that implementing sapling intercropping is an important way to build a socialist forestry base with self-reliance, greater, faster, better and more economical results. Before 1964, the farm only engaged in forest-grain and forest-oil intercropping. In 1964, after the successful trial intercropping of red clover in the sapling mountain land of Wangshan Forest Farm, it was widely promoted throughout the farm in 1965 and was generally successful. At present, more than 1,200 mu of red clover intercropped in the sapling mountain land throughout the farm is generally growing well. There are three benefits of doing this: first, fertilizing the mountain and accelerating the growth of saplings; second, collecting red clover seeds to solve the contradiction between the red clover seed retention in paddy fields and the early rice planting season, which is conducive to increasing rice production; and third, increasing income and supporting the mountain with the mountain. This year, they have also trial-planted medicinal materials in the saplings, developing the original three intercropping of forest-grain, forest-oil, and forest-fertilizer into four intercropping of saplings (that is, adding forest-medicine intercropping).
    The staff and workers of the Damaoshan Reclamation Farm always remember Comrade Mao Zedong's teaching: "The movement of change in the objective real world is never-ending, and people's understanding of the truth in practice is also never-ending." They are determined to study Chairman Mao's works more diligently, strengthen investigation and research, continuously summarize experience, and make greater achievements in the transformation of the objective world while better transforming the subjective world and in forestry production and construction.

    山区建设的一个好经验
    江西大茅山综合垦殖场的经验证明，山区建设必须以林业建设为中心，林业建设必须以造林营林为基础
      国营江西大茅山综合垦殖场，在以营林为基础的思想指导下，近年来采取了一些革命化的措施，狠抓造林营林工作，使更新跟上了采伐，还绿化了大面积荒山，林业和农业生产，出现了生气勃勃的大好局面。
    走进这个垦殖场，人们便可以看到，在一条条环山的水平带上，在一个个整齐的鱼鳞坑里，都生长着以杉树为主的各种幼林。早几年栽植的杉树已经郁闭成林，新造的幼林也都青葱翠绿。垦殖场荒山造林的标兵——汪山林场，六年来新造的六千七百多亩林木中，就有五千二百多亩是杉树用材林，一九六○年造的五百多亩杉树林，最高的已有八米多，最粗的胸径有十二厘米。
    大茅山垦殖场从一九六二年冬天开始，仅三年多的时间，就造林三万二千多亩，相当于前五年造林保存面积的四点六倍，等于建场八年来采伐面积的两倍。这些新造幼林，保存率达百分之九十八点三；成活率达百分之九十以上；生长量（据去年秋天调查），以优势树种杉树为例，一九六三年造的平均高一米四，一九六四年造的平均高八十六厘米，一九六五年造的，当年新梢生长平均高达二十六厘米，最快的四十三厘米。预计再过十五年，这些新造的杉林，就可以开始采伐成材。按照这个场的林业发展规划，今后每年造林和更新面积，都将在一万亩左右。这样，二十年后，按每年采伐六千亩、每亩产材十五立方米计算，每年可以上调木材九万立方米，等于今年上调木材的五点二倍，并可轮伐五十年。如果这样坚持做下去，这个场的林业生产，完全可能实现愈采愈多、愈采愈好、永续作业、青山常在的要求。
    这个场的粮食生产和多种经营，同时获得了迅速发展。粮食生产每年大幅度增产，去年又在前年增产百分之九点六的基础上增产百分之二十四点九，其中林粮间作收获的粮食就有十八万六千多斤。九千多亩水田的粮食单位面积产量，已由一九六二年的三百六十四斤，迅速上升到七百一十九斤。
        反复实践反复认识反复斗争树立起以营林为基础的思想
    革命方法来自革命思想，革命思想来自革命实践。大茅山垦殖场职工坚持突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，在实践中不断地总结经验教训，不断地有所创造，有所前进。
    林业生产建设必须以营林为基础，这是林业生产客观规律的要求。然而，由于营林是多年性生产，一时不容易看到成效；采伐是当年性生产，很快就能获得收益。因此，人们往往容易为暂时的眼前利益所迷惑，而忘记了营林这项根本大计。大茅山垦殖场树立以营林为基础的思想，就经过了反复的实践、反复的认识、反复的斗争。
    在建场初期的一九五八年到一九六○年上半年，他们用主要力量狠抓了山区工业和副业生产，这对于能够很快地安下家来，并以短养长，积累资金，有重大意义。但是，在安家性生产告一段落和当年性生产稳定上升以后，他们没有及时将生产重点转向林业生产上来，而把工、副业的积累继续用来扩大工、副业的再生产。有的单位为了多抓收入，对树木乱砍滥伐。结果，在营林方面出现了造的多、管的少、活的更少的现象。一九六○年下半年至一九六二年上半年，在抓粮食生产中，又出现了毁林种粮等现象。眼看着山区的森林资源日益减少，不仅当地社员有意见，部分工人和干部也感到垦殖场没有发展前途。
    这种形势要求垦殖场党委回答：国家在山区办垦殖场的根本目的是什么？应该树立什么样的指导思想？怎样才能贯彻指导思想？
    为了回答这些重要问题，垦殖场党委在一九六二年七月一日在梧凤洞召开了党委扩大会议，本着自我革命的精神，实事求是地分析了建场以来的成绩，批判了重采轻造、重粮轻林等偏向。到会的各级干部畅所欲言，用大量的事实，揭露经营指导思想上的错误和由此产生的恶果。大家首先算了两笔账：
    第一笔，是山和田的比例账：全场共有山林五十万亩（其中森林四十万零八千亩，荒山九万二千亩），基本耕地一万五千多亩（其中水田七千四百多亩），按全场总人口平均计算，每人有山林二十五亩，有耕地七分五厘。这一算，大家都感到，在这样一个山多田少的垦殖场，抓粮食生产固然很重要，但是如果只抓田不抓山，只抓粮不抓林，山区的生产就不能得到全面的发展，就不能很好地适应国家建设和人民生活的需要。
      第二笔，是采伐账：从一九五八到一九六二年，全场共采伐木材十三万二千多立方米，平均每年采伐二万六千多立方米。由于重采轻造、重造轻管，五年内虽然造林四万七千多亩，实际保存下来的只有六千多亩。这样砍下去，按全场的木材总蓄积计算，再过三十年就会全部砍光。这一算，到会的人都大吃一惊，认识到目前这种做法如果继续下去，将会弄到象群众批评的那样“坐吃山空，山穷水尽”的地步。
    接着，大家又讨论了林业与农业的关系，举出了对比鲜明的事实：重溪、绕二分场和附近的公社，由于森林茂密，气候雨量就比较调和，基本上是旱涝无忧，农业生产连年稳产；相反，在林少荒山多的福泉山分场及附近公社，水土流失比较严重，几乎每年都遭受不同程度的旱涝灾害，农业生产不够稳定。大家由此认识到，农业和林业互相依赖，缺一不可，在大办农业时，如果忽视林业，不仅不能搞好农业，而且将直接妨碍农业生产的发展。再说，从发展林业生产中还可以直接获得粮油等产品，如板栗、枣子等木本粮食和油茶等木本油料。
    经过这样充分地揭露矛盾和分析矛盾，大家才明确地认识到，国家在山区办垦殖场的根本目的，就是要把山区建设成为永久性的社会主义林业基地。为此，就必须牢固地树立以营林为基础的思想（当时叫以营林为主），狠抓造林营林，发展林业生产。如果再象过去那样只吃山不养山，不但不能建设好山区，而且无法在山区长期建场安家。
    重新认识汪山林场农林结合经验多快好省地建设起新的林业基地
    垦殖场的龙头山分场有一个汪山林场。从一九五九年冬建立时起，这个林场的职工，在既无粮食、资金，又无造林经验的情况下，决心用愚公移山的精神把全场一万二千多亩长满芭茅草的穷山，改造成为林木茂盛的富山。全林场五十多名职工，不顾风雪严寒，吃在山头，住在山头，砍茅挖兜，全垦整地。没有苗木，他们就到几十里外山上采集杉条；没有技术，他们就虚心向当地老林农学习；没有一亩基本耕地，又没有开垦资金，他们就大抓以短养长，实行幼林和作物合理间作，常年总收入共达五百五十六元。经过这样连续三年苦干实干，终于改造了一千一百多亩芭茅荒山，造起了杉树林，并实现了粮钱自给有余。新造的杉树林，据一九六二年底检查，一九六○年插的五百多亩杉条，平均高达二点三米，成活率高达百分之九十二。
    汪山林场这种农林结合的作法，集体所有制的单位也可以搞，特别是值得那些田少、人多、山多的地方仿效。但是，垦殖场党委起初只是把它当作一般的先进单位来看待，没有看清它的重要意义。在梧凤洞会议以后，由于以营林为基础的思想十分明确，又经过深入调查，党委才认识到，汪山林场是一面荒山造林的鲜明旗帜，大力推广汪山的经验，就能够把全场八万多亩最易引起山林火灾的芭茅荒山迅速消灭，就能够多快好省地变穷山为富山，建起新的林业基地。于是，通过多种形式，大张旗鼓地宣传和推广汪山的先进经验，号召全场职工，学习他们在建设社会主义新山区中的高度责任感和事业心；学习他们在造林营林中，艰苦奋斗、自力更生的革命精神；学习他们“长短结合，以短养长”、“林粮间作，以林为主”的长远观点及先进经验；学习他们在生产斗争和科学实验中实行“领导、老林农、群众”三结合的群众路线的工作方法。
    汪山荒山造林的经验一推广，很快就掀起了全垦殖场向芭茅荒山进军的造林高潮。各级干部都纷纷带领工人群众上山安营扎寨，冒着风雪严寒整地造林。为了实现造林“三高”（成活率高，保存率高，生长量高），各林场不仅在造林时严格遵守造林技术规程，而且在造林后坚持补植、坚持抚育。东坑、潘家、宝林山等林场的工人，脱下自己的棉衣，遮盖待用的树苗，确保了苗根湿润。叶村、炉口等林场工人，为了新造幼林速生丰产，主动地挑猪栏粪、火土灰上山作底肥。小茅山林场造林后遇旱，死了一些树苗，工人们坚持补植，一次不行，两次，两次不行，三次，终于使当年杉树成活率达到百分之九十以上。经过这样顽强的斗争，荒山造林越造越多，越造越好。全场从一九六三年至一九六五年三年里，在荒山上造林二万多亩。
    从马蹄湾采伐方式的革命得到启示辩证地处理森林采伐与更新的关系
    在荒山造林搞起来之后，垦殖场党委又进一步分析了全场林业生产现状：在五十万亩山林中，森林有四十多万亩，荒山有九万多亩。这表明在整个林区的经营管理上，现有森林是个大头。只有搞好现有森林的采伐更新，才能实现永续作业，青山常在。当时，采伐更新是大茅山垦殖场最薄弱的环节，因此必须狠抓和抓好，也就是说必须处理好采伐与更新的关系。
    南溪林场有一块山场叫马蹄湾，是一块杂灌木丛生的稀疏残败林，共有六十二亩。一九六○年秋天，这个林场的党支部考虑到，只有把这些稀疏残林全部砍光，实行人工更新，才能彻底改变这块山场的林相，促进下一代林木速生丰产。在经过和职工群众商量研究以后，就把这块山场的林木全部砍光，并且在一九六一年春天插杉、点桐、间作粮食。当时，垦殖场领导对这种采伐方式一再提出批评，认为这样“剃光头”是错误的。可是，检验真理的标准是实践，到一九六三年秋，马蹄湾山场新造起的杉树幼林普遍长势旺盛，套种的油桐也开始结子。在横港林场等地的情况也证明，凡是采取和马蹄湾同样的采伐更新的方式的山场，幼林都长得很好。
    马蹄湾山场的采伐方式当真是错了吗？垦殖场领导不得不重新思索这个问题，终于认识到：原来过去一再批评的所谓“剃光头”采伐方式，实际上是正确的小片皆伐。马蹄湾山场的做法，是在采伐方式上进行革命的一个苗头。这与那种毁林种粮的“剃光头”完全是两回事。过去笼统地反对“剃光头”，在客观上为“抓壮丁”（专拣最好的树砍）的乱砍滥伐打了掩护。那时，不少林场为了完成木材上调任务，在不“剃光头”的名义下，进山“抓壮丁”——“老的不要，小的不要，弯的不要，病的不要”，专拣最好的树砍。结果，本来是次生林的林场，越砍越稀，越伐越次；本来有规格材的富山，变成了“远看青山在，近看无成材”的穷山。群众批评说，这是“黄鼠狼偷鸡，越偷越稀”，弄得山场里“老的老了，小的小了，青壮年不见了”。
    象马蹄湾山场这样小片皆伐“剃光头”的采伐更新办法，粗看起来，似乎等于从头来，费工多，收效慢。其实，比起通常所用的打洞栽树的办法来，小片皆伐虽然开头费工较多，以后却大大省工。他们用两者作了对比，小片皆伐每亩整地造林一般是八点七个工，因为杂柴杂草不多，一年抚育两次只要三个工；只需抚育三年就郁闭，共九个工，合计十七点八个工。打洞栽树，开头每亩只要四个工，但杂柴杂草多，一年抚育两次要六个工，要抚育五年，共三十个工，如果每年抚育一次，五年也要十五个工，加上造林，共十九个工；往后的砍伐、运输比起前者更艰巨更费工。同时，前者因杂柴杂草少，不易发生火灾，防护也比较方便；后者则相反。特别是前者可以适当植密，如杉树每亩可栽三百到四百株，成活率高，成材速度快，成材量大。中期能间伐，使长期收入中有短期收入，还能保证十五年到二十年内，每亩出胸径二十二到二十四厘米的成材十五到二十个立方米。一般在柴丛中打洞栽树，即使幼树生长正常，也要二十年到二十五年才能成材。这样做，杉树每亩只能栽三四十株到一百来株，最多不到二百株。由于成活率低，每亩只能出成材三到十个立方米。各种情况相比之下，马蹄湾山场的做法，看来笨，实际巧；看来慢，实际快；看来费劲，实际省劲；看来是失，实际是得；看来树少，实际树多。
    铁一般的事实和具体分析，教育了垦殖场领导干部。他们深深地感觉到过去对马蹄湾山场的批评，虽然出发点是为了保护国家森林资源，而实际效果却是扼杀了新生事物的成长；如果不公开承认自己的错误，就会让落后的东西继续保存和发展，就无法在采伐方式上进行革命，就无法正确处理采伐与更新的关系。垦殖场领导干部经过一场激烈的思想革命之后，向全场职工承认过去对马蹄湾山场的批评是错误的，肯定马蹄湾山场的采伐方式是正确的，必须推广；同时指出“抓壮丁”的采伐方式是一种最隐蔽、最厉害的乱砍滥伐，必须坚决制止。
    从此，全场上下都把是否作了合理采伐，是否使更新跟上了采伐，作为衡量自己对革命工作是否负责的重要标尺。大家还在以后的生产实践中，通过不断总结，进一步提高了对采育结合的认识，并且创造不少采育结合的方法。过去，大家只理解到采伐是目的，更新是手段，更新是为了采伐；以后，联系本场次生林多、单产低的实际情况进行调查研究，才认识到，要改变林相、提高单产，有必要把采伐当作手段，把更新当作目的。采伐与更新两者实际上是互为手段，互为目的的，只有这样完整地理解两者的关系，才能通过采伐达到更好的更新，通过更新达到更多的采伐。这样，就把原来“采伐与更新相结合”、“更新要跟上采伐”的口号，发展为“采伐要从有利于更新出发，更新一定要跟上采伐，使森林资源一代超一代”，从而使“以营林为基础”的思想更加积极和鲜明。他们根据因地制宜和有利于更新的原则，在采伐方式上，一方面提倡以小片皆伐为主；另一方面，对于坡度较陡、容易引起水土流失的山场，对于有天然更新条件的山场（如幼龄树木较多的，留马尾松母树可飞子成林的），就实行采育兼顾。在更新方式上，一方面提倡以人工更新为主；另一方面，对于有天然更新条件的山场，即实行人工促进天然更新。他们就这样处处从实际出发，采取机动灵活的方法，正确地解决了采育结合中的一系列矛盾。
    提高造林营林质量必须突出政治
        执行制度要依靠群众的革命自觉
    大茅山垦殖场在一九六二年以前造林数万亩，基本上是“年年造林，年年不见林”，勉强保存下来的幼林，大部分生长很慢。为什么会出现这种情况呢？从造林工作本身来看，主要是没有贯彻质量第一的方针。一九六二年梧凤洞会议以后，他们认真总结了前几年造林营林的经验教训，认识到在造林中，没有质量，就没有数量，不讲究质量，就会劳民伤财，失去造林的目的和意义。只有狠抓质量，才能达到造林多、成活多、生长快、出材多的目的。
    几年来，他们为了提高造林营林质量，十分注意突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，贯彻民主管理，提高工人对山区前途的认识和当家作主的思想，把执行造林营林质量的制度，建立在群众革命自觉的基础上。同时积累了一套搞好造林营林质量的经验。这些经验，概括说来就是“一高”、“两坚持”。一高就是造林质量标准高，两个坚持就是造林后坚持补植、坚持抚育。
    坚持造林质量标准高，主要是抓好适地适树、细致整地、选用壮苗、肥土入穴、舒根打紧这五条基本措施。适地适树，就是要因地制宜，什么山适合栽什么树，就栽什么树，不强调“青一色”。细致整地，不一定是全垦，采取什么方式整地，应根据山场、劳力、资金、时间诸因素，全盘考虑。一般说来，坡度在二十五度以下的山场，可以搞全垦，坡度在二十五度以上三十五度以下的山场，最好搞水平带条垦或水平带与穴垦相结合。但是，如果劳力、时间等条件允许，也可以先全垦，接着筑水平带。搞水平带的好处是，当年就可以起到保持水土的作用，并便于作业和实行幼林间作。坡度在三十五度以上的山场，严禁搞全垦，只能搞鱼鳞坑。肥土入穴，就是在开挖大穴时，把表土与生土分别堆放，在植树前，先把表土填入穴中，再将穴的周围的表土刮入穴中。这是一种就地取材解决大面积造林施底肥的好办法。
    坚持补植，就是对新造幼林在头两年坚持缺一株补一株。这样做，才能造一亩、活一亩、保一亩。坚持抚育，就是要做到造后必抚，抚必抚好。抚育的方法，不宜强调全铲，因为这种抚育方法，既花工又不利于保持水土。对水平带条垦整地的山场，采用全刈条铲。对穴垦整地的山场，采用全刈穴铲或通过全刈条铲逐渐形成水平带，条铲就是在水平带上或穴垦的植树行带上，铲草松土；对带与带之间的杂草不铲，以利保持水土和增加绿肥肥源。这样做，该粗即粗，该细即细，比全铲抚育，质量更好，用工更省。
      “林”字当头，幼林间作，一举数得
    大茅山垦殖场几年来的实践证明，在幼林地里大搞间作，只要坚持“林”字当头，就能一举数得。首先，增多了抚育次数，能加速幼林生长；其次，提高山地利用率，能收获大量的粮食、油料等产品，实现以短养长；第三，以抚代耕，一工双益，降低成本，节约劳力。现在，这个场已经越来越深刻地体会到，实行幼林间作，是自力更生、多快好省建设社会主义林业基地的一条重要途径。在一九六四年以前，这个场只搞林粮、林油间作。一九六四年，在汪山林场幼林山地试验间作红花草获得成功后，一九六五年在全场大面积推广，普遍获得成功。目前，全场一千二百多亩间作在幼林山地的红花草，普遍生长良好。这样做的好处有三：一是肥山，加速幼林成长；二是收红花草子，解决水田红花草留种与栽种早稻季节的矛盾，有利于稻田增产；三是增加收入，以山养山。今年，他们又在幼林间试种药材，把原有的林粮、林油、林肥三间作，发展为幼林四间作（即增加林药间作）。
    大茅山垦殖场职工时刻记着毛泽东同志的教导：“客观现实世界的变化运动永远没有完结，人们在实践中对于真理的认识也就永远没有完结。”他们决心更加努力学习毛主席著作，加强调查研究，不断总结经验，在改造客观世界的同时，更好地改造主观世界，在林业生产建设中做出更大的成绩来。
