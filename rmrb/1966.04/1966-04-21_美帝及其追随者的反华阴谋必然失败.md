    The Anti-China Conspiracy of US Imperialism and its Followers is Bound to Fail
    Japan-China Friendship Association National Representative Conference Says the Banner of Friendship Between the People of Japan and China Will Forever Fly Brightly
    Pathet Lao Radio Says Lao People Firmly Support China's Opposition to Anti-China Provocations by Indonesian Rightists
    Pakistani Newspaper Says China Has Friends All Over the World and Cannot Be Isolated
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th - The two-day National Branch and Group Representative Conference of the Japan-China Friendship Association successfully concluded on the 18th. This conference demonstrates that the Japan-China people's friendship movement is vigorously developing in recent years, which is a powerful blow to the pro-US, pro-Soviet, and anti-China Japanese reactionaries.
    The conference announced that as of the end of March this year, the membership of the Japan-China Friendship Association has exceeded 60,000.
    During the conference, more than 500 representatives from all over the country analyzed the situation of the Sato government colluding with the US and the Soviet Union to actively oppose China, and conducted heated discussions on further strengthening the organization of the Japan-China Friendship Association, running the newspaper well, and thwarting the "containment" of China policy of the Japanese-American reactionaries, and adopted relevant resolutions.
    The resolution condemning the US aggression against Vietnam, adopted by the conference, pointed out that the countless facts of US air and naval forces repeatedly violating China's airspace and territorial waters prove that the US war of aggression against Vietnam is also directed against China.
    The resolution expressed firm opposition to the US war of aggression against Vietnam, demanding that the US stop all military provocations against China, and also demanded that the Sato government stop supporting the US aggression against Vietnam and abandon its hostile policy towards China. The conference also adopted a series of resolutions, including a resolution on protesting the Sato government's refusal to allow the delegation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs to enter Japan; a resolution on promoting the signature campaign demanding the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations; and a resolution opposing the Sato government's bill to the Diet to deprive overseas Chinese and Korean residents in Japan of the right to ethnic education.
    Hisao Kuroda, Yoshitaro Hirano, Seimin Miyazaki, Michio Iwamura, and other vice-chairmen of the Japan-China Friendship Association attended the meeting and spoke at the meeting. Vice-Chairman Mishima I of the Japan-China Friendship Association emphasized in his closing remarks that no matter what winds blow or what rain falls, the banner of friendship between the people of Japan and China will never fade and will always fly brightly in the wind.
    The conference finally closed in the singing of "Tokyo-Beijing" and rhythmic applause.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 20th - Pathet Lao Radio issued a commentary on the 19th, strongly condemning the barbaric atrocities of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces in instigating thugs to attack the Chinese Embassy in Jakarta.
    The commentary pointed out that this extremely serious provocative act by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces extremely rudely and blatantly violated diplomatic privileges, very seriously violated international law, and was an extremely blatant and arrogant provocation against the great People's Republic of China.
    The commentary said that the purpose of this action was obviously to undermine the friendship between the people of Indonesia and the people of China.
    The commentary said that such provocative actions by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces, as well as their actions to suppress the Indonesian people and overseas Chinese, are part of their conspiracy to establish a military dictatorship in Indonesia and turn Indonesia into a new colony and war base of the United States in Southeast Asia. Obviously, the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces are exposing their reactionary features and are walking down the road of serving as running dogs of US imperialism.
    The commentary said that as close friends of the Indonesian people and the great Chinese people, the Lao people are extremely indignant at this action by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces.
    The Lao people firmly support the just stand taken by the People's Republic of China against the provocations of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces. The Lao people firmly support the just struggle of the Indonesian people against the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces.
  Xinhua News Agency, Dhaka, 17th - The Dhaka edition of the *Morning News* published an editorial on the 17th on the warm welcome given to Chairman Liu Shaoqi by the Pakistani people during his visit to Pakistan, saying that China "cannot be surrounded, and any attempt to isolate China will surely fail, because China has friends all over the world."
    The editorial mentioned a passage from Vice Premier Chen Yi's speech at the Dhaka citizen's reception on the 15th, saying: "These words will always remain in our ears and become the source of our strength. We will never forget the support China gave us during the war in September last year."
    The editorial said: It has been proven that China is a friend in need, and we know that China is supporting us and will continue to support us no matter what happens, which is heartwarming. (With picture)
    On February 7th this year, representatives from all walks of life in Japan gathered in Tokyo and decided to further launch the movement to restore Japan-China diplomatic relations. The meeting was convened by the Liaison Council for Promoting the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations.

    美帝及其追随者的反华阴谋必然失败
    日中友协全国代表会议说日中两国人民友好旗帜将永远鲜明地飘扬
    巴特寮电台说老挝人民坚决支持中国反对印尼右派的反华挑衅
    巴基斯坦报纸说中国的朋友遍天下，它是孤立不了的
    新华社东京十九日电　历时两天的日中友好协会全国支部和小组代表会议已于十八日胜利闭幕。这次会议表明，近年来，日中人民友好运动正在蓬勃发展，这是对亲美联苏反华的日本反动派的一个有力打击。
    会议宣布，到今年三月底日中友协会员已经突破六万人。
    在会议期间，来自全国各地的五百多名代表，分析了佐藤政府勾结美苏积极反华的形势，并就进一步壮大日中友协组织、办好机关报、粉碎日美反动派“遏制”中国的政策等方面进行了热烈的讨论，并且通过了有关决议。
    会议通过的谴责美国侵略越南的决议指出，美国海空军屡次侵犯中国的领空和领海的无数事实证明，美国侵越的战争也是针对中国的。
    决议表示坚决反对美国侵略越南的战争，要求美国停止对中国进行任何军事挑衅，同时还要求佐藤政府停止支持美国侵略越南和放弃敌视中国的政策。会议还通过了一系列决议，其中包括关于抗议佐藤政府拒绝中国人民外交学会代表团入境的决议；关于推进要求恢复日中邦交签名运动的决议以及反对佐藤政府向国会提出剥夺旅日华侨和朝鲜侨民进行民族教育的权利的法案。
    日中友好协会副会长黑田寿男、平野义太郎，理事长宫崎世民，副理事长岩村三千夫等出席了会议，并在会上讲了话。日中友好协会副会长三岛一在致闭幕词时强调说，不管刮什么风，下什么雨，日中两国人民友好的旗帜将永不褪色，永远鲜明地迎风飘扬。
    会议最后在《东京—北京》的歌声和有节奏的掌声中宣布闭幕。
    新华社康开二十日电　巴特寮电台十九日发表评论，强烈谴责印度尼西亚右派反动势力指使暴徒袭击中国驻雅加达大使馆的野蛮暴行。
    评论指出，印度尼西亚右派反动势力的这一极其严重的挑衅行为，极端粗暴和明目张胆地侵犯了外交特权，非常严重地违反了国际法，是对伟大的中华人民共和国进行的极其明目张胆和蛮横的挑衅。
    评论说，这一行动的目的，显然是为了破坏印度尼西亚人民和中国人民之间的友谊。
    评论说，印度尼西亚右派反动势力的这种挑衅行动以及镇压印度尼西亚人民和华侨的行动，都是它们企图在印度尼西亚建立军事独裁制度、把印度尼西亚变成美国在东南亚地区的新殖民地和战争基地的阴谋的一部分。很显然，印度尼西亚右派反动势力正在暴露出它的反动面目，并正在沿着充当美帝国主义走狗的道路走下去。
    评论说，作为印度尼西亚人民和伟大的中国人民的亲密朋友，老挝人民对印度尼西亚右派反动势力的这种行动感到无比愤慨。
    老挝人民坚决支持中华人民共和国对印度尼西亚右派反动势力的挑衅所采取的正义立场。老挝人民坚决支持印度尼西亚人民反对印度尼西亚右派反动势力的正义斗争。
  新华社达卡十七日电　《晨报》达卡版十七日就刘少奇主席访问巴基斯坦期间受到巴基斯坦人民热烈的欢迎发表社论说，中国“是包围不了的，孤立中国的任何企图一定会遭到失败，因为中国的朋友遍天下。”
    社论提到陈毅副总理十五日在达卡市民招待会上讲的一段话时说：“这些话将时时留在我们耳边，成为我们力量的泉源。我们永远不会忘记中国在去年九月间的战争中给予我们的支持。”
    社论说：已经证明中国是患难中的朋友，我们知道中国在支持我们，并且不论发生了什么事情将继续支持我们，这是使人心里感到温暖的。（附图片）
    今年二月七日，日本各界代表在东京集会，决定进一步展开恢复日中邦交运动。会议是由促进恢复日中邦交联络会议召开的。
