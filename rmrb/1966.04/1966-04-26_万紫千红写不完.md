    Can't Finish Writing About the Myriad Purples and Thousands of Reds
    Harbin First Tool Factory Fitter Duan Jiwu
    I've been doing propaganda work in the workshop for more than a year or two. Maybe some people will say, "Then you must have a lot of experience!" Oh! I wouldn't dare say that. In the past, although I wouldn't say I was always ahead of the situation, I never lagged behind. But in the new upsurge of production, my legs and pen couldn't keep up. I just wrote about new people and new things on the blackboard, and before long, even newer things came along. Busy as I was, everyone still said, "Old news, only just writing about it now!"
    I mustered my strength and resolved to catch up. I arrived at the workshop early in the morning. Hey! The whole workshop was bright and clear, the small red flags on the machine tools fluttered in the wind, and the large banners spanning the walls were a fiery red, which made people feel energized at a glance. I held my notebook in my hand, ready to quickly write down any new people and new things I discovered, to show people that I wasn't just a slowpoke. As I was thinking, suddenly, there was a burst of laughter. Turning my head, I saw that it was the young lathe operators Zhao Dianying and Ji Xiuli, smiling as they looked at the products they had taken from the machine tools. I thought this must be something new. Usually, they were a pair of innovation fanatics. Xiao Zhao has a knack for drilling when working, and Xiao Ji is the most resourceful. "What are you up to?" I hurried over and asked. "Old Duan, our forming tool is a success, look! It increases efficiency by more than double and reduces labor intensity." Xiao Zhao said excitedly. I jumped up with joy when I heard this. I thought, this is good material, I have to write it down quickly, or I'll lag behind again. As I was writing, the workshop propaganda member Xiao Chen rushed over and said to me, "Go and take a look! Master Sun's ninety-degree broaching tool has been successfully tested, increasing efficiency tenfold." I was shocked to hear this and hurried towards the planer. I had only run a few steps when I heard someone shout, "Hey! Old Duan, come quickly, the stamping pad is a success!" An even more exciting cheer attracted me, and a group of masters and apprentices were chatting and laughing around a stamping machine. Oh! It turned out that the young fitter Xu Chang had spent more than a month mechanizing the hand-processed flower pads. In the past, it took more than forty minutes to make one, now three can be stamped in one minute, and the quality is completely up to standard. What a great initiative, how could it not be exciting?
    I grabbed Xu Chang's hand and said: Can you talk about how you overcame the difficulties during the experiment? Xu Chang smiled and said seriously: Everything has difficulties! Working is fighting difficulties! One sentence answered my question. I was about to ask him a few more questions, but Xiao Chen ran over and stuffed me with several innovation report forms. I looked at them and saw that the lathe team Shen Yunping had innovated the 5892 eccentric chuck, Lin Shuyuan had innovated the non-stop drilling of internal hexagonal screw holes, increasing efficiency... Bad, I suddenly remembered the propaganda matter, I have to write quickly, I wish I had ten hands to write, otherwise, the collected materials would become "old news" again.
    I wrote, wrote, and wrote incessantly, writing about these myriad purples and thousands of reds of innovation. Each and every flower of innovation is so radiant and exciting. I want to write down these fiery red hearts, write down the vitality of our Chinese workers under the shining light of Mao Zedong Thought, write down this soaring workshop in the new upsurge of production!

    万紫千红写不完	哈尔滨第一工具厂钳工　段继武
    我在车间搞宣传工作已经不是一年两年了。也许有人要说：“那你一定有很多经验喽！”哦！这个我可不敢当，过去我虽不敢说总是跑在形势的前头，可也从没拉过后。但是在生产新高潮中，我的腿和笔就跟不上趟了。刚把新人新事写在黑板上，没一会，更新鲜的事又来了，忙来忙去，大家还说：“老黄历啦，才写出来呀！”
    我鼓足劲决心赶上去。一早我就来到车间。嗬！整个车间通明瓦亮，机床上的小红旗随风飘动，横跨两壁的大标语火红一片，叫人一看就感到精神振奋。我手里拿着笔记本，准备发现新人新事就立刻来个速决战，叫人们看看我到底是不是马后炮。我正想着，突然，“咯咯”一阵笑声，扭头一看，原来是青年车工赵殿英和吉秀丽，正看着机床上拿下来的产品笑呢，我想这准是新鲜事。平时她俩就是一对革新迷，小赵干活有股子钻劲，小吉又最能出主意。“你们在搞什么名堂？”我忙走过去问。“老段，我们这把成型刀成功了，你看！提高效率一倍多，还减轻了劳动强度。”小赵兴奋地说。我一听高兴得跳起来。心想，这回有材料了，得赶快写，要不又拉后了。我正写着，工段宣传员小陈急急忙忙跑过来冲我说：“你去看看吧！孙师傅九十度插齿刀试验成功了，提高效率十倍。”我一听大吃一惊，忙朝刨床跑去。刚跑几步，就听有人喊：“喂！老段快来呀，冲垫成功了！”一阵更激动人心的欢呼声把我吸引过去，一群师傅徒弟正围着一台冲床谈笑着。哦！原来这是青年钳工徐昌，用一个多月的时间把手工加工的花垫给机械化了。过去四十多分钟做一个，现在一分钟可以冲三个，质量完全合乎标准。这是多大的创举呀，怎能不叫人激动呢？
    我拽着徐昌的手说：你能不能谈谈试验过程中是怎样克服困难的？徐昌笑笑，一板正经地说：干啥都有困难！干工作就是向困难作斗争嘛！一句话回答了我的问题。我正想再问他几个问题，可是小陈跑来又塞给我几张革新报表，我一看，原来是车工组沈云平革新了5892偏心卡具，林书元革新了不停车钻内六方螺丝孔，提高效率……。不好，我猛然想起宣传的事来，我得快写，恨不得用十双手写，不然，搜集的这些材料又会成了“马后炮”。
    我写呀，写呀，不停地写，写这万紫千红的革新之花。这每一朵革新之花都是那样光彩夺目，激动人心。我要写下这一颗颗火一般的红心，写下这在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下的我们中国工人的活力，写下在生产新高潮中这飞跃的车间！（选自哈尔滨第一工具厂《战报》）
