    Xinhua News Agency, London, 1st – The result of the British parliamentary election held on March 31st is that the Labour Party has taken office again.
    According to the election results, the Labour Party won 364 of the 630 seats in the House of Commons, the Conservative Party won 252 seats, the Liberal Party 12 seats, and one seat was held by the Speaker, who has no right to vote. One seat has not yet been announced.
    Prior to this general election, the Labour government, which had been in power for seventeen months, had only a three-seat majority in the House of Commons. Newspapers here pointed out that the British ruling group believes that the five-year general election must be held early to change this precarious and "dangerous" situation.
    The vast majority of the British people are very indifferent to the general election tricks played by the monopoly bourgeoisie. "Time and Tide" magazine commented on the election, saying: "In most parts of this country, a general mood of indifference is obvious." According to statistics, of the approximately 36 million voters, more than 8 million did not participate in the voting. They said that the Labour Party and the Conservative Party "are the same."
    The basic reason why the Labour Party is back in power is that it not only serves the British monopoly bourgeoisie in the same way as the Conservative Party, but also because it bears the banner of "social democracy" and can play a role that the Conservative Party cannot. Therefore, the monopoly consortium believes that there is currently no need to "change horses midstream."
    The Labour government's domestic and foreign policies since it came to power more than a year ago have not only been appreciated by the monopoly groups, but also favored by Washington because of its obsequious support for the United States' aggressive policies on issues such as Vietnam. On the eve of this general election, "The Daily Telegraph" revealed that if the Labour Party were re-elected, "Washington bankers and British entrepreneurs would have contributed a considerable amount of money to this victory."
    Immediately after being re-elected, Labour leader Wilson announced at 10 Downing Street that he was prepared to take any necessary measures, even "unpopular measures," to deal with the financial and economic difficulties facing Britain. Reuters believes: "Wilson's first unpopular measure to stop the constant economic pressure and rising prices may be to formulate a severe budget immediately after the new parliament convenes."
    As for the Wilson government's relationship with the United States, "The Daily Mirror" said that as long as US President Johnson "makes an encouraging gesture, Mr. Wilson will be happy to be lifted up by the ears like the President's beagle."
    The new parliament will convene on April 18th. Observers here pointed out that although the Labour Party has won a "stable" majority in this general election, in the face of Britain's increasingly deepening domestic and foreign difficulties, the Wilson government's future will not be easy.

### 英国垄断集团赏识　华盛顿也十分宠爱  英工党在大选中获多数议席再次上台

    英国垄断集团赏识　华盛顿也十分宠爱
    英工党在大选中获多数议席再次上台
    新华社伦敦一日电　英国在三月三十一日举行议会选举的结果是，工党再次上台执政。
    根据选举结果，工党在下院的六百三十个席位中获得三百六十四席，保守党获得二百五十二席，自由党十二席，另一席由没有表决权的议长占有，还有一席尚未揭晓。
    在这次大选之前，上台十七个月的工党政府在下院只有三席多数。这里的报纸指出，英国统治集团认为，必须把五年一届的大选提前举行，以改变这种朝不保夕的“危险”局面。
    英国广大人民对垄断资产阶级玩弄的大选把戏十分冷淡。《时与潮》周刊在评论这次选举时说：“在这个国家的绝大部分地方，普遍的漠不关心情绪是明显的。”据统计，在总共大约三千六百万选民中，有八百多万人没有参加投票。他们说，工党和保守党“都是一路货”。
    工党重新当政的基本原因是：它不仅同保守党一样效忠于英国垄断资产阶级，而且由于它打着“社会民主主义”的招牌，可以起保守党难以起到的作用，因此，垄断财团认为，目前无需“中流换马”。
    工党政府上台一年多以来执行的对内对外政策不仅得到垄断集团的赏识，而且由于它在越南等问题上卑躬屈节地支持美国的侵略政策，也得到华盛顿的宠爱。在这次大选的前夕，《每日电讯报》就曾经透露，如果工党再次当选，“华盛顿的银行家和英国的企业家为这次胜利出了相当大的力量”。
    工党领袖威尔逊在重新当选后立即在唐宁街首相府宣布，他准备采取任何必要的措施，那怕是“不得人心的措施”，来对付英国面临的财政和经济困难。路透社认为：“威尔逊为制止经常不断的经济压力和物价上涨的第一个不得人心的措施，可能是在新议会开会后马上制订一个严峻的预算。”
    至于威尔逊政府同美国的关系，《每日镜报》说，只要美国总统约翰逊“作出一个令人鼓舞的姿态，威尔逊先生就会乐意象总统的小猎犬那样，被拉着耳朵提起来。”
    新的议会将在四月十八日开会。这里的观察家指出，尽管工党在这次大选中获得“稳定”的多数席位，但是，面对英国内外交困日益加深的局势，威尔逊政府今后的日子不会好过。
