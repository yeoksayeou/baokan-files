    Production Discussed by All, Opinions Offered by All, Problems Found by All, Solutions Thought of by All
    Taicang County's Production Teams Implement "Democracy Activity Day," Welcomed by Cadres and Masses
    (Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing) On the eighth of each month, all production teams in Taicang County, Jiangsu Province, universally hold "Democracy Activity Day" activities. On this once-a-month "Democracy Activity Day," members listen to the team leader report on production, listen to the accountant report on finances, and then offer opinions to the cadres, make suggestions on production and financial work, including praise, criticism, inquiries, and suggestions, creating a very lively atmosphere.
    Taicang County's "Democracy Activity Day" system began to be promoted from points to areas in July last year. Preliminary results of practice prove that this system is a simple and easy-to-implement good form for rural grassroots organizations to implement "Four Great Democracies." Cadres and masses have generally reflected that this "Democracy Activity Day" is a "monthly clearing," "venting session," "unity day," and "morale-boosting day."
    When the "Democracy Activity Day" was first promoted, some cadres worried that a few people would only want democracy and not centralization, making the work even more difficult. Some cadres felt burned inside when they heard criticism. Among the masses, there were also thoughts of being afraid of offending people. Therefore, the leadership organized cadres and masses to study articles such as "Serve the People" and "Combat Liberalism." Cadres understood that promoting democracy is not a matter of method, but a matter of stance, a matter of respecting or not respecting the masses, believing or not believing the masses, and relying or not relying on the masses. Many members also dispelled their concerns and raised their awareness of being masters of their own affairs. With such an ideological foundation, this system was gradually established and adhered to.
    In order to ensure the effectiveness of the "Democracy Activity Day," three preparations are generally made before the meeting: First, the production team holds a management committee to summarize the month's production and work, carry out criticism and self-criticism, study the work tasks for the current month, formulate small-stage plans, collect the good deeds of the production team, and prepare to report to the commune members' congress and deploy work. Second, the accountant closes the accounts, fills in the publication form, and concentrates with the leaders of the Poor Peasants' Association at the brigade at the beginning of the month to conduct financial audit. The brigade accountant conducts business guidance and prepares for oral publication and public posting. Third, the Poor Peasants' Association holds a meeting to discuss the production, work, and opinions of the cadres in the team, while conducting self-education and discussing the work of the Poor Peasants' Association.
    After the implementation of the "Democracy Activity Day" system, the idea of members being masters of their own affairs has been further established, and the political enthusiasm and collective production enthusiasm of the members have been mobilized. Some things that production team cadres have not thought about carefully or handled properly, on "Democracy Activity Day," members often put forward timely criticisms and suggestions, promoting the improvement of production and various tasks. Some production teams in four brigades of Xinmao Commune prepared to build pig sheds and other buildings after the autumn harvest last year. After the cadres raised this issue on "Democracy Activity Day," the poor and lower-middle peasants suggested careful calculation and diligence and thrift. Later, the members used raw materials thriftily and economically by themselves, saving more than 2,700 yuan for the collective. The members reflected: Everyone discusses production, everyone offers opinions, everyone finds problems, everyone thinks of solutions, everyone strives to be advanced, and there is a guarantee for running the collective well. Through the "Democracy Activity Day," the cadres further learned the working method of following the mass line and felt that the work was easier to do.
    On "Democracy Activity Day," members praised the cadres for their advantages and criticized them for their shortcomings. Under the supervision of the masses, the cadres constantly improved their ideological style. Ma Jinting, the captain of the ninth team of Liunan Brigade, Liuhe Commune, arranged for the members to intercrop soybeans in the green manure fields, and some members could not understand this new measure, so he became angry. The members criticized him on "Democracy Activity Day," and also praised his progress after the Socialist Education Movement. Ma Jinting was deeply moved when he saw that the masses were being realistic and dividing him into two, with criticism and praise. He expressed his determination to correct his shortcomings, and his attitude towards the masses has been better since then. Now many cadres have personally realized from their own feelings that promoting the "Democracy Activity Day" system is the party and the masses' political concern and help for themselves. They said: "Faces should be washed often, and one criticism a month will prevent small shortcomings from becoming big mistakes!" Cadres and members often meet ideologically on "Democracy Activity Day," and the relationship between cadres and the masses becomes closer.
    "Democracy Activity Day" is also a lively form of self-education for the masses. On the "Democracy Activity Day" of October 8 last year, some production teams in Liuhe Commune praised good people and good deeds, and that afternoon, some people took the initiative to block the crossroads to prevent poultry from eating the collective's rice; took the initiative to build field ridges, or helped military families go to the streets to buy feed. Some members also examined their shortcomings on "Democracy Activity Day." The cadres and members of the ninth team of Jiangyan Brigade, Liuhe Commune, did not abide by the regulations for the rotation of the brigade's rice milling machine, and rushed to move the rice milling machine to use it first, causing opinions from other teams. After the education of the party branch, the captain of the ninth team made a review on "Democracy Activity Day," and the members also examined the fact that they only wanted to mill rice first so that they could distribute grain first, regardless of the brother teams, and expressed that they would never do this again in the future.
    The Taicang County Party Committee recently had the following preliminary experience in summarizing the work of "Democracy Activity Day": First, "Democracy Activity Day" is an important part of construction work after the Socialist Education Movement, and it is a basic construction for strengthening ideological and political work at the rural grassroots level. Therefore, it should be included in the county party committee's agenda and grasped frequently. Second, it is necessary to educate cadres and the masses on democratic centralism, organize them to study Chairman Mao's relevant works, and constantly improve their awareness and understanding. Third, the commune party committee and the brigade party branch should strengthen the specific leadership of the "Democracy Activity Day" so that each activity can achieve results. Fourth, the content of "Democracy Activity Day" should pay attention to starting from reality, solving the problems that the masses urgently demand to solve, closely centering on production, promoting production, and implementing the results of "Democracy Activity Day" in production to prevent formalism.

    生产大家议  意见大家提  问题大家找  办法大家想
    太仓县各生产队实行“民主活动日”，受到干部群众欢迎
    据新华社南京电　每月八日，江苏太仓县各个生产队普遍举行“民主活动日”的活动。社员们在这个一月一次的“民主活动日”里，听队长报告生产，听会计报告财务，然后对干部提意见，对生产和财务工作提建议，其中有表扬，有批评，有询问，有建议，很是活跃。
    太仓县的“民主活动日”制度是从去年七月开始由点到面推广开来的。实践的初步结果证明：这个制度是农村基层组织实行“四大民主”的一个简单易行的好形式。干部群众纷纷反映：这个“民主活动日”是“月月清”、“通气会”、“团结日”、“鼓干劲日”。
    在开始推行“民主活动日”的时候，有些干部顾虑少数群众只要民主，不要集中，使工作更难做；有的干部一听批评，心里就火辣辣的；在群众中，也有怕得罪人的思想。因此，领导上组织干部群众学习《为人民服务》、《反对自由主义》等文章。干部们懂得了发扬民主，不是一个方法问题，而是一个立场问题，是尊重不尊重群众、相信不相信群众、依靠不依靠群众的问题；许多社员也打消了顾虑，提高了当家作主的觉悟。有了这样的思想基础，这一制度就逐步建立和坚持下来。
    为了保证“民主活动日”取得效果，会前一般要做好三个准备：一是生产队开管理委员会，总结一个月的生产、工作，开展批评与自我批评，研究本月份工作任务，订出小段计划，汇集生产队的好人好事，作好向社员大会报告和布置工作的准备。二是会计结好账目，填好公布表，在月初与贫协组长集中到大队，进行财务会审，大队会计进行业务辅导，作好口头公布和张榜公布的准备。三是贫协小组开会，讨论队里的生产、工作和对干部的意见，同时进行自我教育和讨论贫协工作。
    “民主活动日”的制度实行以后，进一步树立了社员当家作主的思想，调动了社员群众的政治积极性和集体生产积极性。有些事情，生产队干部想得不细致、办得不周到，在“民主活动日”上，往往有社员及时提出批评和建议，促进了生产和各项工作的改进。新毛公社有四个大队的部分生产队，去年秋季丰收后准备建造猪棚和其他建筑，干部在“民主活动日”提出来后，贫下中农建议精打细算，勤俭节约。后来，社员自己动手，节约地使用原料材料，为集体节省资金二千七百多元。社员反映：生产大家议，意见大家提，问题大家找，办法大家想，先进大家争，搞好集体有保证。干部们通过“民主活动日”，进一步学会了走群众路线的工作方法，感到工作更好做了。
    在“民主活动日”上，社员对干部的优点提出表扬，对缺点提出批评；干部在群众的监督下，不断改进思想作风。浏河公社浏南大队九队队长马金庭，布置社员在绿肥田里夹种蚕豆，有些社员对这一新的措施想不通，他就发起态度来。社员在“民主活动日”上对他提出批评，同时也表扬了他在社会主义教育运动以后的进步。马金庭见群众对他实事求是，一分为二，有批评，有表扬，深受感动，表示决心改正缺点，以后对群众的态度就比较好了。现在不少干部从亲身感受中体会到，推行“民主活动日”制度，是党和群众对自己政治上的关怀和帮助。他们说：“脸要经常洗，一月提一次意见，小缺点不会变成大错误！”干部和社员经常在“民主活动日”进行思想见面，干群关系就更加密切了。
    “民主活动日”又是对群众进行生动活泼的自我教育的形式。浏河公社有的生产队在去年十月八日的“民主活动日”上表扬了好人好事，当天下午就有人主动拦好路口，不让家禽吃集体的稻谷；主动修筑田埂，或帮军属上街买饲料。也有的社员在“民主活动日”上检查自己的缺点。浏河公社江沿大队九队的干部和社员不遵守轮流使用大队轧稻机的规定，抢先把轧稻机搬来用，引起别的队有意见。经过党支部的教育，九队队长在“民主活动日”上作了检讨，社员也检查了光想自己先轧稻可以先分粮，不顾兄弟队，表示今后一定不这样做。
    太仓县委最近在总结“民主活动日”这一工作时，有如下的初步体会：第一，“民主活动日”是社会主义教育运动后建设工作的一个重要内容，是加强农村基层思想政治工作的一项基本建设，因此，要把它列入县委的议事日程，经常来抓。第二，要向干部、群众进行民主集中制的教育，组织他们学习毛主席的有关著作，不断提高觉悟与认识。第三，公社党委和大队党支部要加强对“民主活动日”的具体领导，使每次活动都收到效果。第四，“民主活动日”的内容要注意从实际出发，解决群众迫切要求解决的问题，要紧密围绕生产，促进生产，把“民主活动日”的成果落实到生产上，防止形式主义。
