    Comfort
    As the casualties of the American troops invading Vietnam continue to surge, Wheeler, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, boasted at the military committee meeting of the "Central Treaty Organization" that "from a military point of view," the situation of the United States armed forces in South Vietnam "is significantly and gradually improving."
    For imperialism and reactionaries, eliminating a little brings a little comfort; eliminating a lot brings a lot more comfort. Wheeler's so-called "improvement" in the situation probably refers to this kind of comfort.

    舒服感
    侵越美军的伤亡不断激增，美国参谋长联席会议主席惠勒却在“中央条约组织”的军事委员会议上吹嘘说：“从军事观点看”，美国武装部队在南越的处境
  “是显著地在逐渐改善。”
    对于帝国主义和反动派，消灭一点，舒服一点；消灭得多，舒服得多。惠勒的所谓处境“改善”，大概正是说的这种舒服感。
