    A Sign Reading, "Silver Buried Here: 300 Taels"
    Japanese roving ambassador Yokoyama, in Cairo, was peddling the U.S.'s "peace talks" conspiracy, claiming that Japan would propose a "new suggestion" for solving the Vietnam problem. In order to conceal his inglorious identity as a political broker, Yokoyama professed: "Japan does not act entirely according to U.S. policy."
    However, the so-called "new suggestion" revealed by Yokoyama is nothing more than a revised version of Johnson's "unconditional discussions," and he also admitted that U.S. Vice President Humphrey and others had visited Japan, requesting the Sato government to "help seek ways to stop the Vietnam War." In this way, Yokoyama's profession is completely like a sign reading, "Silver Buried Here: 300 Taels," and the Sato government's behavior of acting entirely according to U.S. policy is a futile attempt to cover up the truth.

    此地无银三百两
    日本的巡回大使横山在开罗为美国兜售“和谈”阴谋，声称日本将提出解决越南问题的“新建议”。横山为了掩饰他不光采的政治掮客的身份，表白说：“日本不是完全按美国的政策办事的”。
    但是，横山透露的所谓“新建议”，无非是约翰逊的“无条件讨论”的改头换面，而且他还承认美国副总统汉弗莱等人曾到日本，要求佐藤政府“帮助寻求停止越南战争的办法”。这样一来，横山的表白就完全是此地无银三百两，佐藤政府完全按美国的政策办事的行径，是欲盖弥彰。
