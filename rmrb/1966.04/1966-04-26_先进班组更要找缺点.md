    Advanced Teams Should Look for Shortcomings Even More
    Qi Qihaer Railway Administration Fitter Zhao Zhongqi
    Our group has been an advanced group for several years, and last year it was also named a "Five-Good" team by the bureau. In reality, the basic skills of some of us are still not solid enough, and sometimes the quality of the overhaul of locomotives cannot meet the "Seven Hardnesses" standard. In order to one-sidedly maintain honor, some comrades glossed over some so-called "minor" issues during acceptance inspections.
    At the preliminary assessment meeting for the "Five-Good" award, some comrades raised this issue, which sparked a heated debate. Some comrades insisted on thoroughly identifying the problems, believing that we should not cover up shortcomings simply to preserve the "Five-Good" status. Other comrades believed that our overhauled locomotives had a reputation for "Seven Hardnesses" across the entire railway system, and publicizing this would have a negative impact and jeopardize our "Five-Good" team title. Everyone held their own opinions and argued endlessly.
    This situation was quickly discovered by the workshop's Party branch. In order to help everyone correctly understand this issue, the branch promptly organized us to study Chairman Mao's teaching in "Serve the People" on serving the people completely and thoroughly. Combining study with practice, everyone discussed the actual situation. During the discussion, many comrades used Chairman Mao's teachings as a weapon to repeatedly explain that the idea of simply creating or preserving honor is wrong and represents a metaphysical viewpoint. It is neither a manifestation of serving the people completely and thoroughly, nor is it the working class's attitude of extreme responsibility towards the Party, the people, and the revolutionary cause. They also believed that for an advanced team, only by continuously exposing contradictions, resolving contradictions, and boldly examining and overcoming shortcomings can it continuously move forward and maintain its honor. After this discussion, some comrades who had previously lacked understanding improved their understanding and resolved their ideological problems. Therefore, in the preliminary "Five-Good" assessment, everyone was able to use a "one divides into two" viewpoint to conscientiously summarize achievements and examine shortcomings, so that the preliminary "Five-Good" assessment truly played the role of a "gas station."

### 先进班组更要找缺点

    先进班组更要找缺点	齐齐哈尔铁路管理局钳工　赵忠奇
    我们小组几年来一直是先进小组，去年又被评为局的五好班组。实际上我们有些人的基本功还不过硬，有时架修机车的质量，还不能达到“七过硬”的标准。有些同志为了片面地保持荣誉，对有些所谓差个“一星半点”的地方，在验收时也就蒙混过关了。
    在五好初评的小组会上，有同志把这个问题提出来了，结果，引起了热烈的争论。一部分同志坚持要彻底把问题检查出来，认为不能单纯地为了保五好而掩盖缺点，另一部分同志认为，我们架修的机车“七过硬”名扬全路，这样张扬出去，影响不好，而且这样一来，五好班组的称号也就保不住了。大家各持己见，争论不休。
    这一情况很快就被车间党支部发现了。支部为了帮助大家正确认识这一问题，及时地组织我们学习了毛主席在《为人民服务》一文中完全、彻底地为人民服务的教导。结合学习，大家联系实际进行了讨论。讨论中，许多同志都以毛主席的教导为武器，反复说明，单纯地为了创荣誉、保荣誉的思想是错误的，是一种形而上学的观点，它既不是完全、彻底为人民服务的表现，更不是工人阶级对党、对人民、对革命事业极端负责的态度，并且认为，对一个先进班组来说，只有不断揭露矛盾，解决矛盾，大胆检查缺点，克服缺点，才能不断前进，保持荣誉。这样一讨论，原来一些认识不足的同志也提高了认识，解决了思想问题。因此，在五好初评中，大家都能够以一分为二的观点，认真地总结成绩，检查缺点，使五好初评真正起到加油站的作用。
