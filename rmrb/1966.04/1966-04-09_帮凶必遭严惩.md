	Accomplices Will Be Severely Punished
	On April 3rd, a Thai army invaded Cambodia, attacked and burned the Cambodian outpost at the Long Don Ancient Temple, and abducted the guards of the outpost. This is a new and serious act of aggression by Thailand against Cambodia. The Cambodian people, under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk, heroically fought back against the invasion of the Thai army, recovered the Long Don Ancient Temple once occupied by the Thai army, and drove the Thai army out of Cambodian territory. The Chinese people resolutely condemn Thailand's aggressive crimes against Cambodia and warmly congratulate the Cambodian people on their victory in repelling the Thai aggression.
	In order to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam to the entire Indochina, US imperialism is actively using the Thai reactionaries as its aggressive pawns; and the Thanom government, which has sold itself to US imperialism, is also willing to serve the American aggressors. Especially in recent months, under the instigation of US imperialism, the Thai army has continuously invaded Cambodian territory, carrying out slaughter and looting, causing serious losses to the Thai people. This more blatant act of aggression by the Thai army, as pointed out in the Cambodian government's statement, proves that the Thanom government "has increasingly become a tool of Washington imperialists who are attempting to rule the people of Southeast Asian countries by war."
	However, US imperialism has been battered and bruised on the South Vietnamese battlefield, and its conspiracy to expand the war of aggression against Indochina has also been resolutely resisted and severely hit by the people of Indochina countries. It can be affirmed that the Thai reactionaries, who are willing to act as accomplices of US aggression, will not only fail to gain any advantage in the US's conspiracy to expand the war, but will certainly not escape the just punishment of the people of Indochina countries.

    帮凶必遭严惩
    四月三日，一支泰国军队侵入柬埔寨，袭击和焚烧了隆端古寺的柬埔寨哨所，并劫走了哨所的守卫者。这是泰国对柬埔寨新的严重的侵略行为。在西哈努克亲王领导下的柬埔寨人民，英勇地反击了泰国军队的入侵，并收复了一度为泰国军队侵占的隆端古寺，并把泰国军队赶出柬埔寨国境。中国人民坚决谴责泰国对柬埔寨的侵略罪行，热烈祝贺柬埔寨人民反击泰国侵略的胜利。
    美帝国主义为了把侵越战争扩大到整个印度支那，积极利用泰国反动派作为它的侵略走卒；而卖身投靠美帝国主义的他侬政府，也甘心为美国侵略者效劳。特别是最近几个月来，在美帝国主义的唆使下，泰国军队不断侵入柬埔寨领土，进行屠杀和抢劫，使泰国人民遭受严重的损失。这次泰国军队更加明目张胆的侵略行为，正如柬埔寨政府声明中指出的，证明他侬政府“已经越来越成为企图用战争手段来统治东南亚各国人民的华盛顿帝国主义者的工具”。
    但是，美帝国主义在南越战场上已被打得头破血流，它的扩大侵略印度支那战争的阴谋，也遭到了印度支那各国人民的坚决反抗和沉重打击。可以肯定地说，甘心充当美国侵略帮凶的泰国反动派，不仅不能在美国扩大战争的阴谋中捡到什么便宜，而且一定逃不了印度支那各国人民的严正惩罚。
