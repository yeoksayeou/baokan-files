    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming – As the spring plowing season approaches, the five newly built and expanded calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer plants in Yunnan Province have been successively completed and put into production.
    After these factories are officially put into production, the province's production capacity of calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer will increase by nearly two times. These five factories are located in Xuanwei, Chuxiong, Yuxi, Jinning, and Anning.
    Calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer plants have relatively simple equipment, require less investment, and can be put into production quickly, with low product prices. Calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer is also a multi-element fertilizer that can provide various nutrients such as phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and silicon. It not only helps crops resist lodging and pests and diseases, but also improves soil structure, which has a very significant effect on transforming Yunnan's low-yield fields. Therefore, farmers like to use this fertilizer very much.

    云南新建和扩建五座钙镁磷肥厂
    新华社昆明电　在春耕季节到来的时候，云南省新建和扩建的五座钙镁磷肥厂陆续完工投入生产。
    这批工厂正式投入生产以后，全省钙镁磷肥的生产能力提高了将近两倍。这五座工厂分布在宣威、楚雄、玉溪、晋宁和安宁。
    钙镁磷肥厂设备比较简单，投资少，投产快，产品价格便宜。钙镁磷肥又是一种多元素化肥，能提供磷、钙、镁、硅等多种养分，不仅有助于农作物抵抗倒伏、病虫害，而且能改良土壤结构，对改造云南的低产田作用十分显著，因此，农民很喜欢使用这种化肥。
