    Brief Comments
    Who "Enlightened" Him?
    Former US presidential candidate Goldwater used to openly advocate that the goal of US foreign policy should be to achieve the "demise of the Soviet-Communist regime" and pretended to attack Johnson's so-called "US-Soviet coexistence" policy. Khrushchev's revisionists called him a "madman" to distinguish him from the "sober people" like Johnson and believed that he should be "enlightened."
    Recently, Goldwater made a statement saying: "The entire free world will unite with Russia against China." What's going on?
    Goldwater and Johnson have always been birds of a feather, but this "madman" has indeed been "enlightened" now. Where did he get it from? Isn't it very clear?
    Why "Regret"?
    After the New Son Nhut Airport of the US puppet regime was attacked by the South Vietnamese People's Liberation Armed Forces, Westmoreland, the commander of the US invading forces in Vietnam, went to pay his respects in person. Seeing the scene of heavy losses, he couldn't help but exclaim in sorrow: "The casualties we have suffered are regrettable."
    However, this defeated general actually wanted to cover up his defeat, saying that "the Viet Cong's attack did not achieve its goal, far from it." If that were the case, Westmoreland should be overjoyed. Could it be that he felt "regret" because the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces "did not achieve its goal"? This is really strange logic!

    三言两语
    谁“开导”了他？
    美国前总统候选人戈德华特以前公开鼓吹，美国的对外政策应该以取得“苏维埃—共产主义政权的消逝”的“胜利”为目标，并且装出一副姿态，竭力攻击约翰逊的所谓“美苏共处”政策。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者把他称为“狂人”，以别于约翰逊等的“清醒的人”，认为应当对他加以“开导”。
    戈德华特最近却发表主张说：“整个自由世界将同俄国一起反对中国。”这是怎么一回事呢？
    戈德华特和约翰逊从来都是一丘之貉，但这个“狂人”现在确实得到了“开导”，而从哪里得到，这不是很清楚吗？
    为什么“遗憾”？
    美伪的新山一机场被南越人民解放武装力量袭击后，侵越美军司令威斯特摩兰亲往凭吊。他看到那种损失惨重的景象，不禁失声哀叹：“我们受到伤亡是令人遗憾的事情”。
    但是，这个败军之将竟然想掩饰败绩，说什么“越共的袭击没有达到它的目标，差得相当远。”如果真是那样的话，威斯特摩兰倒应当额手称庆才是。难道他是因为南越人民武装力量“没有达到它的目标”而感到“遗憾”吗？这真是奇怪的逻辑！
