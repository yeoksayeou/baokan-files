    (Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 24th dispatch) News from Jakarta: While frantically massacring Indonesian patriots, the Indonesian right-wing general clique is vigorously trying to rehabilitate some old-line right-wing politicians and releasing large numbers of counter-revolutionaries who were sentenced by the former Indonesian government.
    According to Antara News Agency, on the morning of April 19th, the Indonesian right-wing general clique held a "state funeral" in Jakarta for the old-line anti-communist politician Sjahrir, who had signed the "Linggadjati Agreement" with the Netherlands, selling out Indonesia's national interests. Sjahrir served as the Prime Minister of the Indonesian Cabinet from 1945 to 1947. He personally negotiated and signed the traitorous "Linggadjati Agreement." This agreement recognized that independent Indonesia in 1945 was part of the Dutch-Indonesian Federation headed by the Queen of the Netherlands, and allowed Dutch colonialists to continue controlling Indonesian power. In 1959, he was arrested and imprisoned for participating in a conspiracy to assassinate President Sukarno. He was released on bail for medical treatment in May 1965, and died of illness in Switzerland in early April of this year. When the right-wing military regime held a "state funeral" for Sjahrir, it also gave this politician, who sold out national interests, the title of "national hero" and buried him in the Kalibata Heroes Cemetery in Jakarta.
    Sjahrir's funeral became a grand gathering for all reactionary elements in Indonesia. According to Antara News Agency, on this day, some of Sjahrir's "close comrades-in-arms" who jointly opposed communism and the people were released from prison to attend the "state funeral." Former Indonesian Vice President Hatta, the mastermind behind the "Madiun Affair" which caused the bloody massacre of Indonesian communists, the head of the old-line right-wing politician, the head of the right-wing general clique Nasution, Suharto, cabinet ministers of the right-wing military regime, and others attended the ceremony.
    Hatta clamored at the ceremony that Sjahrir was "a victim of a crime" and that his imprisonment was a "tragedy." He demanded the release of "all political prisoners who were detained with Sjahrir."
    At the same time, Nasution and Suharto have also recently made successive speeches clamoring for the release of all counter-revolutionaries who were sentenced by the former Indonesian government. In his speech on the 20th, Nasution said that the arrest of these counter-revolutionaries at that time was not in accordance with the law. He said, "This issue has entered the stage of resolution and will be carried out in phases within the shortest possible time."
    According to Agence France-Presse, prior to this, a group of "anti-communist leaders who had been imprisoned for many years were released from prison." These counter-revolutionaries included Abdul Malik Karim Amrullah, one of the leaders of the Masyumi Party, who was arrested in 1965 for carrying out treasonous activities to overthrow President Sukarno.

    印尼右派将领集团释放大批反革命分子
    公然为卖国贼沙里尔翻案并纵容老牌右派政客哈达等进行活动
    新华社二十四日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派将领集团在疯狂地屠杀印度尼西亚爱国者的同时，正在大吹大擂地为一些老牌右派政客翻案，并且把大批被前印度尼西亚政府判刑的反革命分子释放出笼。
    据安塔拉通讯社报道，四月十九日上午，印度尼西亚右派将领集团在雅加达为曾经同荷兰签订出卖印度尼西亚民族利益的“林牙椰蒂协定”的老牌反共政客沙里尔举行了“国葬”。沙里尔是在一九四五年至一九四七年担任印度尼西亚内阁总理的，他曾经亲自谈判和签订了卖国的“林牙椰蒂协定”。这项协定承认在一九四五年独立的印度尼西亚是以荷兰女王为元首的荷兰—印度尼西亚联邦的一部分，并且使荷兰殖民主义者继续控制印度尼西亚政权。一九五九年，他因参加谋杀苏加诺总统的阴谋被捕入狱，在一九六五年五月因病保释，今年四月初在瑞士病死。右派军人政权在为沙里尔举行“国葬”的时候，还给这个出卖民族利益的政客加上了
  “民族英雄”的头衔，并且把他埋葬在雅加达的加里巴塔烈士陵园里。
    沙里尔的葬礼成了印度尼西亚一切反动分子的大聚会。据安塔拉通讯社报道，在这一天，一些同沙里尔共同反共、反人民的“亲密战友”，被从狱中释放出来参加“国葬”。前印度尼西亚副总统、制造血腥屠杀印度尼西亚共产党人的“茉莉芬事件”的元凶、老牌右派政客哈达、右派将领集团的头目纳苏蒂安、苏哈托，右派军人政权的内阁部长等参加了这个仪式。
    哈达在仪式上叫嚷沙里尔是“一项罪恶的牺牲者”，他的被监禁是一个“悲剧”。他要求释放“同沙里尔一起被拘禁的所有政治犯”。
    与此同时，纳苏蒂安、苏哈托最近也连续发表谈话叫嚷要释放所有被前印度尼西亚政府判刑的反革命分子。纳苏蒂安在二十日的讲话中说，当时逮捕这些反革命分子是不合法律规定的。他说，“这个问题已经进入解决阶段，并将在最短期间内分期进行”。
    据法新社报道，在这以前，一批“多年来被关在监狱里的反共领导人获释出狱”。这些反革命分子中，包括马斯友美党的领导人之一阿卜杜勒·马利克·卡里姆·阿马鲁拉，他是在一九六五年因进行叛国活动阴谋推翻苏加诺总统而被捕的。
