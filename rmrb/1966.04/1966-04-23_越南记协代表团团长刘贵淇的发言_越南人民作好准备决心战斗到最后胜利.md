    Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd – Lưu Quý Kỳ, head of the Vietnamese Journalists Association delegation, told delegates from various countries attending the Fourth Plenary Meeting (Enlarged) of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association on the 21st that the Vietnamese people, who are engaged in the anti-American national salvation struggle, are ready to fight to the final victory, whether it takes five, ten, or twenty years.

    In his speech at the meeting, Lưu Quý Kỳ also exposed the "peace talks" hoax played by the United States. He said that the "peace talks" and "unconditional discussions" spread by the United States are attempts to cover up its new "gradual escalation" of the war. No matter to what level the U.S. imperialism escalates on the road to war, the result can only be that it will fall into a more shameful pit of failure.

    Lưu Quý Kỳ strongly condemned U.S. imperialism for launching a frenzied war of destruction against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with its air force and navy. He said that the monstrous crimes of U.S. imperialism are also the most brutal provocations against the national liberation movement and the peoples of Asian, African, and socialist countries, thereby exposing its most dirty face and extremely reactionary nature. Under the guise of "freedom" and "democracy," U.S. imperialism is just a vicious, bloodthirsty demon.

    After listing the various crimes of the American aggressors, he said that U.S. imperialism has completely miscalculated. The Vietnamese people have withstood all tests, are determined to fight and win, and have given the American aggressors the punishment they deserve. So far, in North Vietnam alone, nearly a thousand of the most modern American aircraft of thirty types have been shot down, and hundreds of America's best pilots have been killed or captured. The so-called "air superiority" and "power" of the United States have been shattered by the strength of the entire people fighting to defend the motherland.

    He said that the Vietnamese people have successfully carried out the two tasks of production and combat. The slogan "hammer in one hand, gun in the other," "plow in one hand, gun in the other" has been very specifically reflected in improving productivity, being ready to fight at any time, and fighting to shoot down American planes. In the anti-American national salvation struggle, the revolutionary heroism of the Vietnamese people has been fully developed. The revolutionary heroism of the people and the people's war are the factors for our victory.

    Lưu Quý Kỳ said that the Vietnamese people firmly believe that the anti-American national salvation line and the people's war line we are following will surely lead us to complete victory.

    When talking about the U.S. "peace talks" hoax, Lưu Quý Kỳ said that Johnson clamors for "peace" without announcing recognition of Vietnam's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, is unwilling to withdraw troops from South Vietnam, is unwilling to stop bombing North Vietnam, and is unwilling to let the Vietnamese people solve their own internal affairs. Then, this "peace" is only fake "peace," just a conspiracy to occupy South Vietnam by peaceful means and turn South Vietnam into a U.S. colony. The means of "peace talks," which are closely combined with military "gradual escalation," are just a conspiracy to force the Vietnamese people to surrender to it! The Vietnamese people uphold the banner of their national independence and genuine peace, determined to fight to crush the aggressive plots of U.S. imperialism, defend the North, liberate the South, and unify the motherland.

    He said that the four-point position of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point statement of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front fully and centrally embody the aspirations, will, and interests of the Vietnamese people. As long as U.S. imperialism refuses to recognize and implement these provisions, the Vietnamese people will still be determined to fight, resolutely smash all the despicable conspiracies and plans of U.S. imperialism to invade Vietnam, be determined to consume and eliminate U.S. aggressive forces, and be determined to give the American air and sea pirates the punishment they deserve.

    Lưu Quý Kỳ said that our people fully recognize their tasks to the nation and the motherland, and at the same time fully recognize their role and international status in the world national liberation movement, the national independence, democracy, and peace movement. Our people will dedicate all their strength. Our South Vietnamese people have defeated U.S. imperialism's "special war" and are defeating the 250,000 American troops that have just poured in in large numbers. Our North Vietnamese people have also won victory in the war of destruction. We will also surely win victory in any type of war and any scale of war launched by the adventurous United States.

    When talking about the excellent situation of anti-imperialism in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, Lưu Quý Kỳ said that because the revolutionary forces continue to be on the offensive, imperialism is fiercely counterattacking, trying to save its failure. In this situation, imperialism is frantically intensifying the war in Vietnam and instigating coups in some areas of Asia and Africa, such as Indonesia and Ghana. Lưu Quý Kỳ said that in Indonesia, imperialism has extremely barbarously killed and persecuted local patriotic and democratic forces and communists, arousing the immense indignation of the people of Asian, African countries and the world. We would like to express our deep feelings and deep sympathy to the Indonesian people, and sincerely wish the Indonesian people to achieve the final victory in the current struggle. The future belongs to the 100 million heroic Indonesian people.

    Lưu Quý Kỳ said that the imperialist counterattacks have caused some difficulties for the revolution in some places, but these are only temporary and local difficulties. Revolutionary forces are continuing to advance and will certainly win complete victory. This is the inevitable objective development of history.

    越南记协代表团团长刘贵淇的发言
    越南人民作好准备决心战斗到最后胜利
    新华社二十二日讯　越南新闻工作者协会代表团团长刘贵淇，二十一日向出席亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议（扩大）的各国代表说，正在进行抗美救国斗争的越南人民已经作好了准备，不管战斗五年、十年或二十年，也决心战斗到最后胜利。
    刘贵淇在会议的发言中，还揭露了美国玩弄的“和平谈判”的骗局。他说，美国散布的“和平谈判”、“无条件讨论”的论调，是企图掩盖它的新的“逐步升级”的战争步伐。不管美帝国主义在战争的道路上升到那一级，其结局只能是使它掉到更可耻的失败泥坑中的一级。
    刘贵淇强烈谴责美帝国主义以空军和海军向越南民主共和国发动疯狂的破坏性战争。他说，美帝国主义的滔天罪行，同时是对民族解放运动、亚非和社会主义各国人民进行最粗暴挑衅，从而暴露了它最肮脏的面目和极端反动的本质。在“自由”、“民主”的假面具遮盖下，美帝国主义只是一个凶恶的、嗜血成性的恶魔。
    他列述了美国侵略者的种种罪行后说，美帝国主义已经完全打错了算盘。越南人民已经经受了一切考验，已经决战和决胜，给了美国侵略者应有的惩罚。到目前为止，仅在越南北方，已经有包括三十种类型的将近一千架美国最现代化的飞机被击毁，成百名美国最好的飞行员已被击毙或被捕。美国的所谓“空中优势”和“威力”，已被全民战斗保卫祖国的力量所砸碎。
    他说，越南人民，已经良好地实现了生产和战斗的两项任务。“一手拿锤，一手拿枪”，“一手扶犁，一手拿枪”的口号已经非常具体地体现在提高生产率、随时准备战斗和击落美机的战斗等方面的指标上。在抗美救国的战斗中，越南人民的革命英雄主义精神得到了充分的发扬。人民的革命英雄主义精神和人民战争是我们取得胜利的因素。
    刘贵淇说，越南人民坚信，我们正在遵循的抗美救国路线、人民战争的路线，一定将把我们引向彻底的胜利。
    刘贵淇谈到美国的“和谈”骗局时说，约翰逊叫嚷“和平”而不宣布承认越南的独立、主权和领土完整，不愿从越南南方撤退军队，不愿停止轰炸越南北方，不愿让越南人民自己解决自己的内部事务，那么，这种“和平”只是假“和平”，只是一种通过和平手段来占领越南南方，变越南南方为美国的殖民地的阴谋。同军事上的“逐步升级”紧紧结合的“和平谈判”手段，只是一种迫使越南人民向它投降的阴谋！越南人民坚持自己的民族独立和真正的和平的旗帜，决心战斗以粉碎美帝国主义的侵略图谋，保卫北方，解放南方，统一祖国。
    他说，越南民主共和国的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明所阐明的立场，完整和集中地体现了越南人民的愿望、意志和利益。只要美帝国主义不肯承认和实现这些条文，越南人民就还要决心战斗，坚决粉碎美帝国主义侵略越南的一切卑鄙的阴谋和计划，决心消耗和消灭美国的侵略力量，决心给美国海空强盗以应有的惩罚。
    刘贵淇说，我国人民充分认识到自己对民族和祖国的任务，同时充分认识到自己对世界民族解放运动、对民族独立、民主和和平运动的作用和国际地位，我国人民将献出自己的全部力量。我们越南南方人民已经战胜美帝国主义的“特种战争”，并且正在战胜刚大量涌进的二十五万美军，我们越南北方人民也已经在破坏性战争中赢得胜利。我们也必定将在美国冒险发动的任何类型的战争和任何规模的战争中赢得胜利。
    刘贵淇在谈到亚、非、拉反帝的大好形势时说，由于革命力量继续处于攻势，因此帝国主义正在激烈反扑，妄图挽救它们的失败。在这种情况下，帝国主义就疯狂强化在越南的战争，并且在亚非两大洲的一些地区，如印度尼西亚和加纳等国家策动政变。刘贵淇说，在印度尼西亚，帝国主义极其野蛮地残杀和迫害当地的爱国、民主力量和共产党人，激起了亚非各国和世界人民的无比愤慨。我们谨对印度尼西亚人民表示深厚的感情和深切的同情，衷心地祝愿印度尼西亚人民在目前的斗争中取得最后的胜利。未来是属于一亿英雄的印度尼西亚人民的。
    刘贵淇说，帝国主义的反扑对一些地方的革命造成了若干困难，但这只是暂时的、局部的困难。革命力量正在继续前进，并定将赢得完全胜利。这是历史必然的客观发展。
