    All Aggressors and Their Lackeys in the World Will Be Buried
    The Storm of Demonstrations by the South Vietnamese People Frightens the United States
    South Vietnam National Liberation Front Issues Statement Warmly Welcoming the Anti-U.S. Puppet Struggle of the People in Enemy-Occupied Cities
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 13th - According to a report by the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency on the 13th, the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front recently issued a statement warmly welcoming the resolute struggle of the people in the cities of South Vietnam against the U.S. aggressors and the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky puppet regime.
    The statement pointed out that due to the continuous victories of the South Vietnamese army and people on all battlefields and the failure of the U.S. war of aggression, the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky traitorous clique, in order to extricate themselves from their predicament, have, since 1965, at the behest of the United States, allowed more U.S. aggressors and satellite troops to come to South Vietnam. They have sold areas such as Cam Ranh Bay and Vung Tau to the United States for ninety-nine years, and allowed the U.S. aggressors to transport all kinds of killing weapons to conduct an extremely brutal war of aggression in South Vietnam.
    The statement said that since the U.S. aggressors came to South Vietnam, the lives of the people in the enemy-occupied areas have become increasingly painful. The Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique drive the people from their homes, seize their land, cut off water and electricity supplies, rape women, and plunder the people's property to offer to their American masters. Heavy taxes, rising living expenses, huge fines, inflation, lack of water and electricity, homelessness, unemployment, and starvation, all of these weigh on the shoulders of the urban people. Moreover, the arrogant attitude and discriminatory behavior of the U.S. aggressors, the decadent culture imported from the United States, and the trampling of South Vietnamese children, brothers, and sisters by the U.S. aggressors have greatly damaged the national self-esteem of the South Vietnamese people.
    The statement said that the people of South Vietnamese cities cannot tolerate the heavy oppression of the U.S. aggressors and the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique, and since mid-March, they have risen up to oppose them. This struggle first broke out in Hue and Da Nang, and then expanded to fourteen towns in South Vietnam. It started with students, but now people from all walks of life, regardless of gender, age, religious belief, or political inclination, have joined in. Their struggle has also won the sympathy of South Vietnamese puppet soldiers, police, and civil servants. In many places, people have taken to the streets to demonstrate, using sticks and stones to defend themselves. They hold up banners protesting the war of aggression launched by the U.S. and the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky dog-leg group in South Vietnam and the atrocities committed, protesting the U.S. government's protection of the robber-like Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky group, demanding that the U.S. stop interfering in South Vietnam's internal affairs, and establish a truly democratic government that fights for independence and sovereignty, exercises democratic rights, and solves the people's immediate rights.
    The statement said that the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front warmly welcomes the indomitable and resolute spirit of struggle of the people in the cities of South Vietnam. The broad unity and concerted action of the South Vietnamese people has made the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys tremble with fear and panic.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 13th - According to a report by the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, as the infighting within the U.S. puppet Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique intensifies, the angry tide of the broad masses of people against the U.S. puppet clique is surging from Quang Tri City near the 17th parallel to Saigon, the ruling center of the U.S. puppet clique, and from Pleiku in the western highlands to the enemy-occupied cities along the eastern coast, powerfully striking the U.S. aggressors and their running dogs.
    The report said that, according to statistics, in the nearly one month from March 12 to April 8, in thirteen cities including Saigon, Hue, Da Nang, Quang Tri, Hoi An, Quang Ngai, Tam Ky, Nha Trang, Qui Nhon, Da Lat, Pleiku, Kontum, and Buon Ma Thuot, eight hundred thousand people participated in the mass struggle against the U.S. aggressors and the Nguyen Cao Ky puppet clique. The masses participating in the demonstrations included young students, workers, laborers, small vendors, etc. Many puppet soldiers and puppet regime personnel also participated in the demonstrations. The masses adopted various forms of struggle, such as continuous strikes, work stoppages, market strikes, gatherings, and demonstrations. Moreover, as the struggle developed, they put forward clear slogans such as "Down with the U.S. aggressors," "Oppose turning South Vietnam into a testing ground for new weapons," "Oppose the war of burning all, killing all, and destroying all," "Vietnam belongs to the Vietnamese," "Yankees get out of South Vietnam," "Down with the corrupt and traitorous Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique," and "Defend sovereignty."
    After March 23, the general strike, market strike, and school strike in Da Nang and Hue reached a climax, almost paralyzing the two cities. The masses in Saigon fought continuously day and night for six or seven nights, and fought in the streets with puppet paratroopers and police. On April 7 and 8, the demonstrating masses in Saigon also surrounded Nguyen Cao Ky's "Prime Minister's Office" and chanted slogans against the U.S. aggressors and traitors. (Attached picture)

    世界上一切侵略者及其走狗通通都要被埋葬掉
    南越人民示威风暴使美国惊慌失措
    南越民族解放阵线发表声明热烈欢迎敌占区城市人民反美伪斗争
    新华社河内十三日电　据越南南方解放通讯社十三日报道，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会最近发表声明，热烈欢迎越南南方城市人民开展反对美国侵略者和阮文绍—阮高其傀儡当局的坚决斗争。
    声明指出，由于越南南方军民在所有战场上不断取得胜利和美国侵略战争的失败，阮文绍—阮高其卖国集团为了摆脱困境，自一九六五年以来，按照美国的命令让更多的美国侵略者和仆从军到越南南方来。他们把金兰湾和头顿等地区卖给美国九十九年，并让美国侵略者运入一切杀人武器，在越南南方进行极其残酷的侵略战争。
    声明说，自从美国侵略者到越南南方以来，敌占区的人民生活变得越来越痛苦。阮文绍—阮高其集团把人民赶出家门，抢走他们的土地，切断水电供应，强奸妇女，强夺人民的财产来献给他们的美国主子。苛捐杂税、生活费用上涨、巨额罚款、通货膨胀、缺乏水电、无家可归、失业和挨饿，这一切都压在城市人民的肩上。而且，美国侵略者的傲慢态度和歧视行为、从美国输入的腐朽文化，以及南越的儿童、兄弟姐妹遭受美国侵略者的蹂躏，大大损伤了南越人民的民族自尊感。
    声明说，越南南方城市人民无法忍受美国侵略者和阮文绍—阮高其集团的重重压迫，从三月中旬以来，奋起反对他们。这场斗争从顺化和岘港首先爆发，然后扩大到越南南方十四个城镇，开始时只有学生参加，而现在各界人民，不分男女老少，宗教信仰和政治倾向都参加进来了，他们的斗争还赢得了南越伪军、警察和公务员的同情。在许多地方，人民涌上街头示威，用棍棒和石块进行自卫。他们高举着标语牌，抗议美国和阮文绍—阮高其走狗集团在南越发动的侵略战争和犯下的暴行，抗议美国政府保护强盗般的阮文绍—阮高其集团，要求美国停止干涉南越内部事务，建立一个真正的民主政府，这个政府为争取独立和主权、行使民主权和解决人民的切身权利而斗争。
    声明说，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会热烈欢迎南越城市人民的不屈不挠和坚决斗争的精神。南越人民的广泛团结和一致行动，使美国侵略者及其仆从胆战心惊，惊慌失措。
    新华社河内十三日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，在美国傀儡阮文绍—阮高其集团的内讧愈演愈烈的时候，越南南方从靠近十七度线的广治市到美伪集团的统治中心西贡，从西部高原的波来古到东部沿海的敌占区城市，广大人民反对美伪集团的怒潮，风起云涌，有力地打击了美国侵略者和它的走狗。
    报道说，据统计，从三月十二日到四月八日的近一个月里，西贡、顺化、岘港、广治、会安、广义、三岐、芽庄、归仁、大叻、波来古、昆嵩、邦美蜀等十三个城市，就有八十万人次参加了反对美国侵略者和阮高其傀儡集团的群众斗争。参加示威的群众包括青年学生、工人、劳动者、小商贩等，许多伪军、伪政权人员也参加了示威。群众采取了多种斗争形式，如连续举行罢课、罢工、罢市、集会和游行示威等。而且随着斗争的发展，提出了“打倒美国侵略者”、“反对把越南南方作为新武器的试验场”、“反对烧光、杀光、毁光的战争”、“越南是属于越南人的”、“美国佬从越南南方滚出去”、“打倒贪污和叛国的阮文绍—阮高其集团”、“保卫主权”等鲜明的斗争口号。
    三月二十三日以后，岘港和顺化的总罢工、罢市和罢课达到了高潮，使这两个城市几乎陷于瘫痪。西贡群众曾经连续六、七个晚上彻夜进行斗争，并在街道上同伪伞兵和警察展开搏斗。四月七日和八日两天，西贡的示威群众还包围了阮高其的“总理府”，并高呼反对美国侵略者和卖国贼的口号。（附图片）
