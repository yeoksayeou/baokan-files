    Xinhua News Agency, April 8th, New Delhi Dispatch: In order to follow the US imperialism's plot of creating "Two Chinas," India actually allowed Shen Qi, the "Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, to wantonly express opinions supporting India and opposing the motherland at a press conference in New Delhi on the 5th.
    According to a United Press International report on the 5th, Shen Qi expressed that he would "open a second front against China" to support India.
    The Press Trust of India and Indian newspapers have been continuously reporting on the activities of Shen Qi, Li Guoding, and other Chiang Kai-shek clique elements in recent days, and openly quoting their words, indicating that the Indian authorities are closely developing their relationship with the Chiang Kai-shek clique.
    The Press Trust of India even referred to Shen Qi as "Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China (Taiwan)" on the 5th, and quoted him as saying that he "is 'full of hope' for the matter of his country becoming closer with India." The news agency also stated that Shen Qi, during his stay in New Delhi, "found that Indian leaders are 'very sympathetic to his country.'"
    It is reported that Shen Qi also presented rice seeds to Indian Food Minister Subramaniam on the 4th. Chiang Kai-shek clique "Minister of Economic Affairs" Li Guoding and Indian Commerce Minister Manubhai Shah and others held "useful discussions." These two Chiang Kai-shek clique elements also discussed the possibility of "closer technical cooperation between the two countries" with Indian ministers and members of parliament.

    印度政府加紧反华不择手段
    公然纵容蒋帮分子在印度进行阴谋活动
    新华社八日讯　新德里消息：印度为了追随美帝国主义搞“两个中国”的阴谋，竟然让蒋帮“外交部次长”沈锜五日在新德里的一个记者招待会上放肆发表支持印度和反对祖国的言论。
    据合众国际社五日报道，沈锜表示将要“对中国开辟第二战线”来支持印度。
    印度报业托辣斯和印度报纸在最近几天不断报道沈锜和李国鼎等蒋帮分子的活动，并且公然引用他们的话，表示印度当局正在密切它同蒋帮的关系。
    印度报业托辣斯五日竟然称沈锜为“中华民国（台湾）外交部次长”，还引用他的话说：他“对于他的国家同印度之间变得密切这件事‘充满了希望’。”这家通讯社还说，沈锜在新德里逗留期间“发现印度领导人‘非常同情他的国家’。”
    据报道，沈锜还曾经在四日向印度粮食部长苏布拉马尼亚姆赠送稻种，蒋帮“经济部长”李国鼎同印度商业部长马努巴伊·沙阿等人进行了“有用的讨论”。这两个蒋帮分子还同印度的部长和议员讨论了“密切两个国家的技术合作”的可能性。
