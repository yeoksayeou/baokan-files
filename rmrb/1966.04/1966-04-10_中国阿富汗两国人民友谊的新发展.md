    During Chairman Liu Shaoqi's visit to Afghanistan, he and his entourage received the warmest welcome and most ceremonious hospitality from the Afghan government and people. Afghan newspapers, in reporting the enthusiastic welcome of the people of Kabul for Chairman Liu Shaoqi, said, "This situation is unprecedented."

    On April 4th, Kabul was experiencing heavy rain, yet over one hundred thousand Kabul residents stood on the streets in the rain, waiting to welcome Chairman Liu Shaoqi. The rain soaked their clothes, but it could not extinguish their passionate feelings. In the welcoming crowds were youth and women, elders, elementary school students carrying their satchels, and even doctors and nurses who did not have time to change out of their white work clothes. When the car carrying Chairman Liu Shaoqi and the King of Afghanistan passed by, the dense crowds on both sides of the road enthusiastically cheered, "Welcome, welcome!" They showered the Chinese guests with countless flowers. Some young people enthusiastically ran alongside the car. In Herat, Afghanistan's third-largest city, wherever Chairman Liu and his entourage went, crowds of citizens and farmers would automatically gather to express their warm welcome.

    At the grand rally held by the citizens of Kabul on the afternoon of April 7th to welcome Chairman Liu, tens of thousands of people packed the Ghazi Stadium to capacity. Outside the stadium, countless others were trying to squeeze in. Prince Sultan, Chairman of the Afghanistan-China Friendship Association, said to Chairman Liu, "People all want to see more of Your Excellency the Chairman."

    To see more of the Chinese leaders, to have more contact with the Chinese guests, and to learn more about China – this was the universal sentiment of people from all walks of life in Afghanistan. At the grand receptions held after the state banquets and farewell banquets, and on other occasions, many Afghan officials, prominent figures in society, and journalists expressed their hope to visit China. Some of them had already visited once and now wanted to go again for a second time. The Kabul newspaper "Daily News," in publishing many articles about the situation in the new China, used the large headline: "Understanding China's vast land and fighting people."

    The King and Queen of Afghanistan spoke to Chairman Liu and his wife about their visit to China more than a year ago, about the enthusiastic welcome they received in the rain upon arriving in Beijing, and about their fondness for the chrysanthemum exhibition and the beautiful scenery of West Lake in Hangzhou. Vice Premier Chen Yi, who had visited Afghanistan many times, also expressed to the Afghan hosts his desire to visit Afghanistan again in the future. The desire of the leaders and people of both countries for more mutual visits and understanding reflects the common aspirations for friendly unity among Asian and African countries and peoples. Just as the King of Afghanistan said to Chairman Liu, "Afghanistan and China have had similar experiences and can understand each other's suffering."

    To express their feelings for the Chinese leaders and people, the Afghan government and people arranged the most distinctive national programs to entertain the Chinese guests. The "Buzkashi" (goat grabbing competition) held at Ghazi Stadium on April 7th left a deep impression on the Chinese guests. This was not an ordinary sports performance, but a grand program only arranged during major celebrations in Afghanistan and for the visit of the most distinguished state guests. The riders participating in this competition need to have superb riding skills, strong will, and extraordinary physical strength. They are divided into two teams, and whichever team's member can grab a decapitated calf weighing dozens of pounds (called "goat grabbing," but generally using a calf), run a lap around the field, and throw it into the designated place, that team scores one point. During the process of running this distance, the team's members try to protect him, and the opposing team's members try to snatch the calf from his hands. In the scene of horses chasing each other and riders vying for the calf, one can imagine the scene of cavalry charging on the battlefield. No wonder this competition is a beloved activity of the brave and tenacious Afghan people. It is precisely this kind of people who have repeatedly defeated the British invading army, causing the invaders to be completely annihilated.

    The Afghan people infinitely cherish their glorious history of opposing imperialism. After accompanying Chairman Liu and his entourage to lay a wreath at the tomb of the former Afghan kings, Prince Sultan specifically guided the Chinese guests to overlook a small hill on the outskirts of Kabul in the rain. This was an ancient battlefield. There, the ancestors of the Afghan people who resisted British aggression shed their blood and inflicted heavy blows on the invaders.

    The Afghan government and people also invited the Chinese guests to visit their long-standing and excellent national cultural heritage. On the walls of the famous Friday Mosque in Herat, the seven-colored glazed tiles were inlaid one by one. The handmade carpets and silk fabrics produced in Herat have been famous abroad for thousands of years. In the National Museum of Afghanistan, the exhibits reflecting thousands of years of history remind people of how rich and precious the cultural treasures created by the peoples of Asian and African countries generation after generation are!

    Western imperialists always portray the peoples of Asian and African countries as ignorant and barbaric. Not long ago, we saw a collection of Afghan photographs published in the United States, which tried hard to make readers believe how desolate this country is. But guests who have been to Afghanistan can use their own personal observations to expose this malicious distortion and propaganda. What we saw was a beautiful country, a country with culture and a glorious history.

    When Afghan friends introduced their cultural heritage to Chairman Liu, they repeatedly mentioned the names of Xuanzang and Faxian. In Afghanistan, Xuanzang's "Great Tang Records on the Western Regions" is often used as an important reference material for archaeological excavation work. Some place names used in this book are still used in Afghanistan today.

    The traditional friendship between the Chinese and Afghan peoples has advanced to a new stage after the establishment of diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and Afghanistan. This time, the representatives of the Chinese people came to Afghanistan and received the warm reception of the Afghan government and people. The friendship between the two countries has been further developed. When Chairman Liu's special plane flew high over the snow-capped mountains between the two countries, people could not help but think: The friendship between the Chinese and Afghan peoples cannot be stopped by high mountains and dense forests, nor can it be stopped by the artificial "encirclement" and "containment walls" of imperialists and their collaborators.

### 中国阿富汗两国人民友谊的新发展

    中国阿富汗两国人民友谊的新发展
    刘少奇主席和他的随行人员在访问阿富汗期间，受到了阿富汗政府和人民最大热情的欢迎和最隆重的礼遇。阿富汗报纸在报道喀布尔人民热情欢迎刘少奇主席的场面时说，“这种情况是空前未有的”。
    四月四日，喀布尔下着大雨，十万多喀布尔人民冒雨站在街头上，等待着欢迎刘少奇主席。大雨淋湿了他们的衣服，但淋不熄他们的火热的心情。在欢迎的队伍中，有青年和妇女，有老人，有拿着书包的小学生，还有连白色的工作衣帽也来不及换下的医生和护士。当刘少奇主席和阿富汗国王乘坐的汽车经过的时候，道路两边密密麻麻的群众热烈地欢呼：“欢迎、欢迎”。他们向中国客人撒了无数的鲜花。一些青年热情地跟着汽车跑。在阿富汗第三大城市赫拉特，刘主席和他的随行人员走到那里，那里就自动聚集了许多市民和农民，向他们表示亲切的欢迎。
    喀布尔市民在七日下午举行的欢迎刘主席的盛大集会上，几万人把加齐体育场挤得满满的。在体育场外面，还有数不清的人努力想挤进体育场来。阿富汗—中国友好协会主席苏尔坦亲王对刘主席说：“人们都想更多地看看主席阁下。”
    想多看一下中国的领导人，多接触一下中国客人，多了解一些中国的情况，这是阿富汗各界人士的普遍心情。在国宴和告别宴会以后举行的盛大招待会上，在其他场合中，好些阿富汗官员、社会知名人士、新闻工作者都向中国客人表示希望访问中国。他们中有些人已经访问过一次，现在还想再去第二次。喀布尔报纸《今日消息》在发表许多关于新中国情况的文章时，使用了“了解中国辽阔的土地和战斗的人民”这样的大标题。
    阿富汗国王和王后向刘主席和夫人谈起他们一年多以前在中国的访问，谈起他们在到达北京时同样是在雨中受到的热烈欢迎，谈起他们喜爱的菊花展览和杭州西湖的美景。已经多次访问过阿富汗的陈毅副总理也向阿富汗主人表示他今后再来访问阿富汗的愿望。两国领导人和人民希望更多地互相访问和了解，反映了亚非国家和人民友好团结的共同要求。正象阿富汗国王向刘主席所说的一样，“阿富汗和中国有过相同的遭遇，互相能够理解对方所受过的苦难。”
    为了表示对中国领导人和人民的感情，阿富汗政府和人民安排了最富有民族特色的节目来款待中国客人。四月七日在加齐体育场上举行的“布什喀希”（抢羊比赛），给中国客人留下了深刻的印象。这不是普通的体育表演，而是只有在阿富汗国内盛大的庆典和最尊贵的国宾来访时才安排这个隆重的节目。参加这种比赛的骑手需要有娴熟的骑术、坚强的意志和过人的体力。他们分为两队，哪一队的队员能把一只砍掉头的几十斤重的小牛（名为“抢羊”，实际上一般用牛）从地上抓起来绕场跑一圈，扔到指定的地方，这一队就得一分。在他跑完这段路的过程中，本队的队员设法保护他，对方的队员设法把他手中的小牛抢走。在马群互相追逐、骑手你争我夺的场面中，人们可以想象到战场上骑兵冲锋陷阵的情景。难怪这种比赛，是勇敢、顽强的阿富汗人民热爱的活动。正是这样的人民，曾经一次又一次打败了英国的侵略军，使入侵者全军覆没。
    阿富汗人民无限珍视他们反对帝国主义的光荣历史。苏尔坦亲王在陪同刘主席一行到阿富汗先王陵墓献花圈以后，特地引导中国客人在雨中俯瞰喀布尔市郊的一个小山包，这是一个古战场。在那里，阿富汗人民反抗英国侵略的先辈们曾经流下他们的鲜血，并且给予侵略者以沉重的打击。
    阿富汗政府和人民还请中国客人参观他们历史悠久和优秀的民族文化遗产。在赫拉特著名的礼拜五清真寺的墙上，那里七色的琉璃瓦是一块块地镶嵌上去的。赫拉特地方出产的手工地毯和丝织品，在千百年前就已经名闻国外。在阿富汗国家博物馆里，那些反映几千年悠久历史的陈列品，使人想到亚非国家人民祖祖辈辈创造出来的文化宝藏，有多么丰富可贵！
    西方帝国主义者总是把亚非国家的人民，描写成是愚昧和野蛮的。不久以前我们看到的一本美国出版的阿富汗摄影集，就极力想使读者相信这个国家是多么荒凉。但是到过阿富汗的客人都可以用自己亲身的见闻揭穿这种恶意的歪曲宣传。我们看到的是一个美丽的国家，是一个有文化、有光荣历史的国家。
    阿富汗朋友在向刘主席介绍他们的文化遗产时，一再提到玄奘和法显的名字。在阿富汗，玄奘的《大唐西域记》常常被用来作为考古发掘工作的重要参考资料。这本书中使用的一些地名，现在还在阿富汗沿用下来。
    中阿两国人民传统的友谊，在中华人民共和国和阿富汗建立外交关系后，又推进到了一个崭新的阶段。这一次，中国人民的代表来到阿富汗，受到了阿富汗政府和人民的亲切接待。两国之间的友谊，又有了进一步的发展。当刘主席一行的专机，高高地飞过两国之间白雪皑皑的群山的时候，人们不尽想到：中阿两国人民之间的友谊，高山密林阻挡不住，帝国主义者和它们的合伙者用人为的“包围圈”、“遏制墙”，也是阻挡不住的。
