    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, 13th – According to a Pathet Lao Radio broadcast: The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a Lao New Year (Songkran Festival) proclamation on the 11th, stating, "In the past year or more, we have eliminated more than 10,000 troops of the United States and its lackeys, shot down more than 300 planes, captured a number of American pilots alive, and seized large quantities of weapons, ammunition, and military supplies, liberating tens of thousands of people from the shackles of the rule of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. The various patriotic forces have grown stronger and more closely united, and at home and abroad, the prestige of the Lao Patriotic Front and the Lao patriotic forces has been increasingly enhanced. We have also made great achievements in increasing production, economy, and culture, which have continuously improved the lives of the people in the liberated areas, and the liberated areas have been increasingly consolidated in all aspects."

    The proclamation pointed out that U.S. imperialism and its lackeys are constantly intensifying and expanding the special warfare being waged against Laos. They have launched many campaigns in the past year, concentrating dozens of battalions of troops to launch offensives against the central and lower Laos regions. Recently, they have also launched fierce offensives against areas such as Phou Kout, Xieng Khouang, and Sam Neua. The United States and its lackeys continue to send bandits, commandos, and spies to the liberated areas to carry out sabotage activities, and they forcibly concentrate the people into so-called "revitalization zones" to suppress and persecute them.

    The proclamation said that U.S. imperialism and its lackeys blatantly violate the Geneva Accords and the various agreements signed by the three Lao parties, carrying out aggressive conspiracies and actions to undermine the peace and neutrality of Laos. The Lao People's Liberation Army, the various Lao patriotic forces, and the people of the whole country have given them due blows, causing them to suffer heavy defeats and thwarting all their ulterior motives.

    The proclamation said that after suffering heavy defeats, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys are plotting new military adventure conspiracies and actions. Therefore, the Lao patriotic army and the people of the whole country must constantly heighten their vigilance, be ready to fight at all times, and thwart all enemy sabotage conspiracies and actions.

    According to another Pathet Lao Radio broadcast, the Supreme Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army recently also issued instructions to the national main forces, local forces, and directly affiliated organs, calling on all commanders and fighters to actively promote the competition of "carrying forward twenty years of revolutionary tradition" and the "five goods" competition while welcoming the Lao New Year, so that the movement to be determined to defeat the American aggressor bandits will flourish throughout the country.

    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, 13th – According to Pathet Lao Radio broadcast: The patriotic soldiers and civilians in some liberated areas of Sam Neua Province and Luang Prabang Province have achieved victories in suppressing bandits and fighting back against enemy attacks.

    On the 2nd, the patriotic soldiers and civilians of Muang Son County, Sam Neua Province, repelled a group of bandits who were harassing them, killing 31 enemies on the spot, wounding many, and seizing many weapons, ammunition, and military supplies.

    The patriotic soldiers and civilians in the Muang Hiem area of Luang Prabang Province eliminated a total of 43 enemies invading the liberated area on March 24 and April 3.

    According to another broadcast from this radio station, a total of 319 bandits in the Muang Xay area surrendered to the people with their guns in the first three months of this year. These surrendered bandits have been given lenient and appropriate arrangements by the local patriotic soldiers and civilians.

    老挝爱国军民一年多歼敌万余毁敌机三百多架
    爱国战线党新年文告号召全体军民粉碎美帝及其走狗的新冒险
    新华社康开十三日电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会十一日发出老挝新年（宋干节）文告说，“在过去一年多以来，我们歼灭了美国和它的走狗的军队一万多名，击落飞机三百多架，活捉一批美国飞行员，缴获大量武器、弹药和军用物资，使数以万计的人们摆脱了美帝国主义及其走狗的统治枷锁而获得了解放。各个爱国力量日益壮大和紧密团结，在国内和国际上，老挝爱国战线党和老挝爱国力量的威信日益得到提高。在增加生产、经济和文化等方面，我们也取得了巨大成绩，使得解放区人民的生活日益得到改善，解放区在各方面日益得到巩固。”
    文告指出，美帝国主义和它的走狗不断强化和扩大对老挝进行的特种战争。它们在过去一年中发动了许多战役，集中数十个营的兵力，向中、下寮地区发动进攻，它们在最近还对富科特山、川圹、桑怒等地区发动了猛烈的进攻。美国和它的走狗仍然不断地派遣土匪、别动队、间谍到解放区进行破坏活动，并且强迫人民集中到所谓“振兴区”来加以镇压和迫害。
    文告说，美帝国主义和它的走狗极其明目张胆地违反日内瓦协议和老挝三方面签订的各项协议，进行破坏老挝的和平、中立的侵略阴谋和行动。老挝人民解放军，老挝各个爱国力量和全国人民，给予它们以应有的打击，使它们遭到惨重的失败，粉碎了它们的一切不可告人的阴谋。
    文告说，美帝国主义和它的走狗在遭受惨重的失败以后，正在策划新的军事冒险阴谋和行动。因此，老挝爱国军队和全国人民必须不断地提高警惕，时刻准备战斗，粉碎敌人的一切破坏阴谋和行动。
    另据巴特寮电台广播，老挝人民解放军最高指挥部最近也向全国主力部队、地方部队和直属机关发出指示，号召全体指战员在迎接老挝新年的时候，要积极促进“发扬二十年革命传统”的竞赛和“五好”竞赛，使决心战胜美国侵略强盗的运动在全国范围内蓬勃发展。
    据新华社康开十三日电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝桑怒省和琅勃拉邦省一些解放区的爱国军民在剿匪和反击敌人进攻的战斗中都获得胜利。
    桑怒省芒松县爱国军民二日打退侵扰的一股土匪，当场打死敌人三十一名，打伤多人，缴获许多武器、弹药和军用物资。
    琅勃拉邦省芒显地区爱国军民在三月二十四日和四月三日共消灭进犯解放区的敌人四十三名。
    另据这家电台广播，芒塞地区在今年头三个月共有三百一十九名土匪携带枪支向人民投诚。这些投诚的土匪已得到当地爱国军民的宽大和妥善安排。
