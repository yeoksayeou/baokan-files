    Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd -- Kang Sang-ho, head of the Korean Journalists Delegation, strongly protested at the Fourth Plenary Meeting (Enlarged) of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association on the 22nd against the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces attempting to strangle the Indonesian revolution under the instigation of U.S. imperialism. He condemned U.S. imperialism for occupying South Korea and using it as a military base for occupying the entire Korea and a bridgehead for aggression in the Far East and Asia. He reminded people that Japanese militarists, with the support of U.S. imperialism, are making a comeback in South Korea, attempting to realize their old dream of dominating Asia.
    In his speech, Kang Sang-ho also firmly condemned the U.S. imperialists' barbaric aggression against Vietnam and their "peace talks" scam.
    Kang Sang-ho said that U.S. imperialism and its lackeys have established a military fascist regime in South Korea, stifling all freedom and democratic rights, and arresting, imprisoning, and massacring patriotic people and the masses who advocate peaceful reunification of the motherland. The U.S. occupation of South Korea and its colonial enslavement policy are the root cause of the misfortune and suffering of the South Korean people, the fundamental obstacle to the reunification of Korea, and the source of the danger of war in Korea.
    He said that to reverse the current disastrous situation in South Korea and end the tragedy of national division, the only way is to drive U.S. imperialism out of South Korea and rely on the independent forces of the nation to achieve the reunification of the motherland. The Korean question is an internal affair of the Korean people and must be resolved independently by themselves.
    Kang Sang-ho condemned the criminal "South Korea-Japan Treaty" illegally signed by the Park Chung-hee clique and Japanese militarists under the direct manipulation of U.S. imperialism. He pointed out that U.S. imperialism is trying its best to piece together an aggressive "Northeast Asia Military Alliance" on the basis of this treaty, in order to drive Japanese militarism to be the vanguard of their aggression in Asia, so as to maintain their precarious colonial rule over South Korea and other parts of Asia. Japanese militarists, with the support of U.S. imperialism, are making a comeback in South Korea, attempting to realize their old dream of dominating Asia.
    He emphasized that the "South Korea-Japan Treaty" is not only a serious obstacle to the reunification of Korea, but also a serious threat to peace and security in the Far East and Asia. Anyone who values peace in Asia and the world should not ignore the conspiracy of Japanese militarism revived by U.S. imperialism and its possible serious consequences. He said, "I believe that all Asian and African journalists will use their righteous pens to actively support the struggle of the Korean people and journalists to withdraw the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops from South Korea, abolish the 'South Korea-Japan Treaty,' and strive for the free reunification of the motherland."
    Referring to the situation in Vietnam, Kang Sang-ho said that today, U.S. imperialism is desperately resorting to aggression and war. They have intensified the heinous war of aggression in South Vietnam, extending the flames of war to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, attempting to further expand it to the entire Indochina and Asia. They are carrying out a barbaric "scorched-earth war" of killing all, burning all, and destroying all. They also continue to send reinforcements and piece together puppet troops from South Korea and other vassal states on a large scale to the South Vietnamese battlefield. He said that all this nakedly and thoroughly exposes the true face of the aggressor - U.S. imperialism - and the truth about the "peace talks" scam it is hyping up.
    Kang Sang-ho said that the Korean people, including journalists, regard the struggle of the Vietnamese people as their own struggle. We will spare no effort to provide all forms of assistance, including weapons assistance, to the fighting Vietnamese people, and we are determined to go to Vietnam as volunteers as soon as we receive

    朝鲜新闻工作者代表团团长姜相渭的发言
    朝鲜人民坚决支援亚非人民反帝反殖斗争
    新华社二十三日讯　朝鲜新闻工作者代表团团长姜相渭，二十二日在亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议（扩大）上，强烈抗议印度尼西亚右派反动势力在美帝国主义的唆使下企图扼杀印度尼西亚的革命。他谴责美帝国主义霸占南朝鲜，并且把它作为占领整个朝鲜的军事基地和侵略远东以及亚洲的桥头堡。他提醒人们注意，日本军国主义者在美帝国主义的支持下正在南朝鲜卷土重来，企图实现他们统治亚洲的旧梦。
    姜相渭在发言中还坚决谴责了美帝国主义对越南的野蛮侵略和玩弄的“和谈”骗局。
    姜相渭说，美帝国主义及其走狗在南朝鲜建立了军事法西斯政权，扼杀一切自由和民主权利，并大肆逮捕、监禁和屠杀主张和平统一祖国的爱国人士和人民群众。美国占领南朝鲜和它的殖民奴役政策是造成南朝鲜人民不幸和苦难的根本原因，是妨碍朝鲜统一的根本障碍，是朝鲜发生战争的危险的根源。
    他说，要扭转南朝鲜目前的灾难局面，结束民族分裂的悲剧，唯一的办法就是把美帝国主义赶出南朝鲜，依靠本民族的主体力量来实现祖国的统一。朝鲜问题是朝鲜人民的内部事务，必须由他们自己来自主地加以解决。
    姜相渭谴责在美帝国主义的直接操纵下，朴正熙集团同日本军国主义分子非法签订的罪恶的“韩日条约”。他指出，美帝国主义竭力要在这个条约的基础上拼凑出一个侵略性的“东北亚军事联盟”，以便驱使日本军国主义做他们侵略亚洲的急先锋，借以维持他们对南朝鲜和亚洲其他地方的摇摇欲坠的殖民统治。日本军国主义者在美帝国主义的支持下正在南朝鲜卷土重来，企图实现他们统治亚洲的旧梦。
    他强调说，“韩日条约”不仅对朝鲜的统一是一个严重障碍，而且对远东和亚洲的和平与安全也是一个严重的威胁。任何珍视亚洲和世界和平的人都不应无视由美帝国主义复活的日本军国主义的阴谋及其可能产生的严重后果。他说，我相信，亚非全体新闻工作者将运用他们的正义的笔杆积极支持朝鲜人民和新闻工作者争取美帝国主义侵略军撤出南朝鲜、废除“韩日条约”，争取祖国的自由统一的斗争。
    在谈到越南局势时，姜相渭说，今天，美帝国主义正在拼命地求助于侵略和战争。他们加紧了在南越的罪恶的侵略战争，把战火扩大到越南民主共和国，妄图把它进一步扩大到整个印度支那和亚洲。他们进行杀光、烧光和毁光的野蛮的“焦土战争”。还继续增派援军，并大规模地拼凑南朝鲜和其他仆从国的傀儡军去南越战场。他说，这一切，就赤裸裸地彻底暴露了侵略者——美帝国主义的真面目和他们大肆宣传的“和谈”骗局的真象。
    姜相渭说，朝鲜人民，包括新闻工作者在内，把越南人民的斗争看成是他们自己的斗争。我们将不遗余力地向战斗中的越南人民提供一切形式的援助，包括武器援助在内，我们决心一接到要求，就到越南去当志愿军。我们无条件地支持越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。
    姜相渭说，帝国主义愈是疯狂，人民的反抗斗争愈是高涨。他表示完全支持和坚决声援亚洲和非洲各国人民为反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义而进行的斗争。
    姜相渭代表朝鲜新闻工作者坚决反对印度尼西亚右派反动势力对亚非新闻工作者协会工作的无耻干涉。他对书记处成员保卫协会不受印度尼西亚右派反动势力的进攻表示敬意，并且支持亚非新闻工作者协会书记处采取的各项措施，包括把书记处暂时撤离雅加达。他表示，朝鲜人民和新闻工作者对美帝国主义和印度尼西亚右派反动势力的兽行，提出强烈的抗议。
