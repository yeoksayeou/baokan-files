    Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch from Washington: State Department spokesman McCloskey announced on the 18th that the U.S. government has signed an agreement with the Indonesian right-wing military government for the U.S. to sell 50,000 tons of rice to Indonesia.
    According to the agreement signed in Jakarta by the U.S. Ambassador and the military government, the rice provided by the U.S. is worth more than $8,190,000, and the U.S. government will provide long-term credit loans to Indonesia to purchase the rice. McCloskey said that this batch of grain will begin to be shipped "as quickly as possible" to the Indonesian right-wing military government, which is facing a severe food crisis.
    This is the first time since the beginning of 1965 that the U.S. government has provided rice or other materials to Indonesia. In commenting on this agreement, American news agencies admitted that this is a form of support from the U.S. for the Indonesian right-wing military government that has sided with it. An Associated Press dispatch on the 18th, in discussing the background of the conclusion of this agreement, said, "U.S. aid to Indonesia was halted last year," but "the dramatic changes in the Indonesian situation since last September have created a more favorable atmosphere toward the West," and Indonesia's relationship with China "has completely changed."

    约翰逊犒赏卖身投靠美国的印尼右派
    美国政府宣布将出售五万吨大米以支持印尼右派军人政府
    新华社十九日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院发言人麦克洛斯基十八日宣布，美国政府已经同印度尼西亚右派军人政府签订了一个由美国向印度尼西亚出售五万吨大米的协定。
    根据这个在雅加达由美国大使和军人政府签订的协定，美国提供的大米共值八百一十九万多美元，美国政府将向印度尼西亚提供购买这些大米的长期信用贷款。麦克洛斯基说，这批粮食将“尽可能快地”开始运给面临着严重粮食危机的印度尼西亚右派军人政府。
    这是一九六五年年初以来美国政府第一次向印度尼西亚提供大米或其他物资。美国通讯社在评论这个协定时承认，这是美国对投靠它的印度尼西亚右派军人政府的一种支持。美联社十八日消息在谈到缔结这个协定的背景时说，“美国对印度尼西亚的援助去年曾经停止”，然而“去年九月以来印度尼西亚事态的戏剧性变化已经创造了一个朝向西方的较有利的气氛”，印度尼西亚同中国的关系“已经完全改变”。
