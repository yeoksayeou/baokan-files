    On the Road of Revolution
    Chen Zhiping, Suzhou Valve Factory
    To establish high standards,
    One must have great ambition.
    Great ambition realizes high standards,
    Never stopping on the road of revolution.
    Being advanced is certainly valuable,
    Learning is even more important.
    The road of revolution is full of rolling waves,
    Being satisfied with the status quo means falling behind!
    Ten thousand horses gallop, the situation is good,
    Heroes show their prowess on every front.
    For the revolution, show your prowess,
    Don't throw away the word "catch up"!
    Keep the revolution in your heart,
    The word "help" is more noble.
    Not for profit, not for fame,
    Dare to be an ordinary "screw"!
    Beyond the mountains, there are more mountains, beyond the buildings, more buildings,
    Even among heroes, there are stronger hands.
    Surpass the advanced and then work harder,
    Look at the world and have a goal to strive for!

    革命路上

    要树高标准，
    比要有雄心。
    雄心落实高标准，
    革命路上步不停。
    先进固可贵，
    学习更要紧。
    革命路上浪滚滚，
    满足现状要后进！
    万马奔腾形势好，
    各道战线逞英豪。
    为革命，逞英豪，
    莫把“赶”字抛！
    革命心中放，
    “帮”字比高尚。
    不为利来不为名，
    敢当普通“螺丝钉”！
    山外青山楼外楼，
    好汉更有强中手。
    超了先进再鼓劲，
    放眼世界有奔头！
