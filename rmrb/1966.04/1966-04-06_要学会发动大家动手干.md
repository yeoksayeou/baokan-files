    Learn to Motivate Everyone to Take Action
    Wang Liansheng, Party Branch Secretary of Xiadianzi Brigade, Shajianzi Commune, Huanren County, Liaoning Province

    Originally, I was not engaged in "proper work"
    I have been a Party Branch Secretary since 1956. Initially, I was not very clear about what the "proper work" of a Branch Secretary was. I took care of everything myself. When I was in the courtyard, if I heard people inside dealing with things, I would worry and had to go in and say something. When I was inside, if I heard people in the courtyard dealing with things, I would worry and also had to go out and say something. Gradually, I managed everything, and the more I managed, the more worried I became.
    I took on everything, and others lost their initiative. When the branch committee met, no one else spoke, and I would get anxious. "Speak up if you have opinions!" "It's fine, no opinions." So, I made all the decisions myself. At branch general meetings, I was the only one who spoke. At team leader meetings, I was the only one who spoke. Even at some mass meetings, the team leaders didn't speak; I was the only one who spoke. In this way, I monopolized all the meetings. The team leaders had nothing to do and couldn't establish their authority. But I was overwhelmed with work myself.
    Soon, there was a Party rectification. Everyone gave me many opinions, saying that I was doing everything myself, not engaged in "proper work," and not taking care of Party work. I thought, I was putting in effort but not getting credit. If you don't do it, I do it, and you still have opinions. I acknowledged it verbally but didn't understand it internally. So, I became passive, only doing "proper work" and not caring about anything else. Wang Ziyun, the branch committee member and team leader, became anxious and said, "It won't work if you don't care!" I said, "I'm in charge of branch work, not an administrative cadre."

    The "Squad Leader" Must Learn to "Play the Piano"
    The commune Party committee discovered this situation and talked to me, asking me to study Chairman Mao Zedong's "Methods of Work of Party Committees" and learn to "play the piano." I said, "I can't even play the zither well, how can I play the piano?" But after studying this article, it dawned on me. Chairman Mao Zedong said, "The secretary is like a 'squad leader.' It is indeed not easy to lead this squad well." When I saw this, I said repeatedly, "That's so right." I continued reading, "If this 'squad' does not act in unison, it is impossible to lead millions upon millions of people to fight and build." I realized that I had not led this squad well, so of course, I could not better lead the masses. Chairman Mao Zedong said, "To play the piano, all ten fingers must move; some cannot move while others do." I thought, I move alone, and others don't move, how can the work be done well? After studying, my understanding improved.
    I had never seen a piano and didn't know how to play it. But I had seen a huqin. To play the huqin well, you must tune the strings well. Don't tune your own string too high and tune other people's strings too low. The branch would assign work to each comrade based on what work they were suited for. After the arrangements were made, everyone went to work separately. If someone did well, I would praise them; if someone didn't do well, I would help them. In this way, everyone was happy. They said, "Wang Liansheng's faults have improved a lot; we must work hard."

    Work is Done Well When Everyone Takes Action
    Does the work get done well when everyone takes action? It gets done very well. One spring, we discussed converting some weedy paddy fields, and I happened to be going out to a meeting. Before leaving, Wang Ziyun asked me, how much should we convert? Which plots? At the time, I wanted to express my views, but then I thought, let them discuss it at home! When I came back, I saw that the conversion was very appropriate. Another time, we discussed and decided to build eighteen iron cage dams. When it was time to start construction, I was away at a meeting, and the team leader led the construction of the dams at home. During construction, they adapted to local conditions and changed the original three level dams into upstream dams. In the past, they could not have changed this without my approval. When I came back, I saw that they had made very good changes, so I praised them for their bold and conscientious spirit.
    After everyone took action, the work became easier. I discussed matters with everyone, and everyone could actively offer their opinions. Sometimes, when the brigade cadres were all away, the branch committee members who did not hold administrative positions would take the initiative to help handle the work. When there was a lot of work, the branch committee members would take the initiative to shoulder the heavy burden. They didn't compete for credit when there were achievements, and they were modest and cautious; they didn't shirk responsibility when there were shortcomings and took responsibility together. In carrying out criticism and self-criticism, we were all brave in admitting and correcting shortcomings and sincerely helped others. In life, branch committee members could also care for and take care of each other.
    From giving play to the collective leadership of the branch committee, I deeply realized that a very important point is that the squad leader must be good at promoting democracy and discuss matters with everyone; the branch committee members should grasp the work according to their division of labor, doing everything yourself is not good, it's exhausting for the individual, everyone has opinions, and the work suffers. Another point is to trust and rely on the branch committee members, give play to their role, and also help them complete the work under their charge.

    要学会发动大家动手干
    辽宁省桓仁县沙尖子公社下甸子大队党支部书记　王连生
    原来是自己不务“正业”
    从一九五六年起，我做了党支部书记。起初，我不很明确支部书记的“正业”是什么。什么事我都一人包揽。我在院里，听到屋里人处理事，就不放心，要去说一说。在屋里，听到院里人处理事，也不放心，也要去说一说。一来二去，什么事都管，越管越不放心。
    我把事都包揽起来，别人就没有主动性了。开起支委会来，别人不说话，我就急了。“有意见说呀！”“行啦，没有意见。”于是，我一个人说了算。开支部大会，我一人讲。开队长会，我一人讲。就是在一些群众会上，队长不讲，也让我一人讲。这样，会都让我包了。队长没事干，威信树立不起来。可是，我自己却忙得不可开交。
    不久，党内整风了。大家给我提了许多意见，说我包办代替，不务“正业”，不管党的工作。我想，自己出力不讨好。你不干，我干了，你还有意见。嘴里承认，内心不通。我就来个消极对付，光务“正业”，别的什么都不管。支部委员、大队长王子云急了，就说，“你不管，怎么行？”我说，“我是管支部工作的，又不是行政干部。”
    “班长”要学会“弹钢琴”
    公社党委发现了这个情况，就找我谈话，要我好好学习毛泽东同志的《党委会的工作方法》，学会“弹钢琴”。我说，“我铁琴都弹不好，还弹什么钢琴？”但是，我学习了这篇文章后，就回味过来了。毛泽东同志说，“书记好比是‘班长’。要把这个班带好，的确不容易。”我看到这里，连声说，“这话真对。”我又往下看，“如果这‘一班人’动作不整齐，就休想带领千百万人去作战，去建设。”我就想到，我真没有把这一班人带好，当然也就不能更好地带领群众了。毛泽东同志说，“弹钢琴要十个指头都动作，不能有的动，有的不动。”我想，我一个人动，别人不动，怎能做好工作？学习以后，我的认识提高了一步。
    我没有见过钢琴，不知怎么弹？可是，我见过胡琴。要拉好胡琴，得把弦定好。不要把自己这条弦定得太高，把别人的弦定得太低。支部就根据那个同志适合什么工作，分配什么工作给他做。安排好了，大家分头去干。谁做好了，我就表扬他；谁做不好，我就帮助他。这样一来，大家都高兴了。他们说，“王连生的毛病改了不少，我们得好好干。”
    大家动手工作就干好了
    大家动手干，是不是干得好呢？干得很好。一年春天，我们研究把一部分草荒的水田改掉，正好我要出去开会。临走时，王子云问我，改多少？改哪块？我当时本想说说看法，又一想，还是让他们在家研究吧！回来一看，改得很合适。又一次，我们研究决定要修十八座铁笼坝。要动工时，我外出开会，大队长在家带领修坝。他们在施工中，因地制宜，把原定的三座等水坝，改为迎水坝。要在过去，这事不得我同意，他们是不能改的。我回来后，看到他们改得很好，就表扬了他们大胆认真的精神。
    大家动手以后，工作就好办了。我遇事同大家商量，大家都能积极提出意见。有时大队干部都不在，没有担任行政职务的支部委员，就主动帮助处理工作。工作多的时候，支部委员都主动抢挑重担子。有了成绩不争功，谦虚谨慎；有了缺点不推诿，互相承担责任。在开展批评与自我批评中，我们都勇于承认和改正缺点，对别人也真诚帮助。在生活上，支部委员之间也能互相体贴，互相照顾。
    从发挥支委会的集体领导中，我深深地体会到，很重要的一条，就是当班长的要善于发扬民主，遇事要同大家商量；要让支部委员按分工去抓工作，包办代替是没有好处的，个人累得够呛，大家还有意见，工作受损失。另一条，就是要相信和依靠支部委员，发挥他们的作用，还要帮助他们完成分管的工作。
