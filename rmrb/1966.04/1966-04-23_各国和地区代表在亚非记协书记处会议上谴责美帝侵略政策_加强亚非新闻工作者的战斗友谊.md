    According to Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd -- Representatives from seven countries and regions, including Vietnam, attending the Fourth Plenary Meeting (Enlarged) of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association Secretariat, spoke at the plenary session held on the 21st. They condemned the aggressive and war policies of imperialism and neo-colonialism, headed by the United States, and emphasized the need to further strengthen the militant friendship of the Afro-Asian people and journalists.

    In their speeches, the representatives expressed support for the temporary relocation of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association Secretariat from Jakarta and highly praised the contributions made by the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association in the cause of opposing imperialism and safeguarding world peace.

    The speeches of these representatives from the front lines of the anti-imperialist struggle garnered warm applause from the entire audience.

    Hoang Van Loi, head of the delegation of the Patriotic and Democratic Journalists Association of South Vietnam, spoke first at the meeting. When he stepped onto the podium, representatives from various countries applauded warmly, paying tribute to the heroic people of South Vietnam.

    Hoang Van Loi said in his speech that the South Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation fully proves that people's war is invincible. The South Vietnamese people are determined to firmly grasp their guns and bury the American aggressors and their running dogs.

    Hoang Van Loi said that the issues that must be resolved in South Vietnam at present are: US imperialism must withdraw all American troops, military personnel, and all kinds of weapons from South Vietnam, abolish its American military bases in South Vietnam, abolish the military alliance it concluded with South Vietnam, stop implementing its policy of aggression against South Vietnam, and let the Vietnamese people solve the problems of South Vietnam themselves.

    After Hoang Van Loi's speech, he presented the meeting with the flag of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front and fragments of an American bandit plane shot down by the South Vietnamese army and people. Djawoto, Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association, and representatives from many countries warmly embraced Hoang Van Loi, and the whole audience burst into thunderous applause.

    Luu Qui Ky, head of the delegation of the Vietnam Journalists' Association, said in his speech that the Vietnamese people firmly believe in the line of resisting US aggression and saving the country and the line of people's war that we are following. No matter whether we have to fight for five, ten, or twenty years, we are determined to fight to final victory. In their speeches, both Luu Qui Ky and Hoang Van Loi strongly condemned the crimes of US imperialism and its running dogs in launching a military coup in Indonesia and suppressing Indonesian patriots. They both pointed out that the Indonesian people are waging an indomitable struggle, and a bright and splendid future will surely belong to the 100 million Indonesian people.

    After his speech, Luu Qui Ky presented the meeting with an artistic film entitled "Twenty Years." The film depicts the heroic struggle of Vietnamese youth in the twenty years from the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to 1965.

    Mazen Bandak, representative of the Palestinian Liberation Organization Journalists Delegation, pointed out in his speech that the Middle East is now facing a new great wave of revolutionary struggle. Imperialism is destined to perish at our hands. He said that the national liberation movement has no other way to go but to fight. After Bandak's speech, on behalf of the Palestinian Liberation Organization Journalists Delegation, he presented the meeting with paintings reflecting the suffering and struggle of the Palestinian people.

    Sébastien Ramazani, head of the delegation of the National Liberation Council of the Congo (Léopoldville), strongly condemned in his speech the monstrous crimes of US imperialism in brutally massacring unarmed residents in the Congo (Léopoldville) and Vietnam. He said that the entire people of the Congo (Léopoldville), who have taken up arms under the leadership of the National Liberation Council, are unwavering in their determination to ensure that all these evil and insane aims of the United States cannot succeed. After Ramazani's speech, he presented the meeting with sculptures exposing the crimes of US imperialism in massacring and oppressing the Congolese people.

    Beladjoug, head of the delegation of Algerian Journalists, said in his speech: "I want to join the representatives of the brotherly peoples of North and South Vietnam, Palestine, and the Congo (Léopoldville) in condemning in unison the most cruel attempts by the US imperialists and their running dogs to suffocate the aspirations of the people." He praised the brotherly peoples of Vietnam, the Congo, Palestine, Rhodesia, Mozambique, South Africa, and other peoples in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Arab world, who are today at the forefront of the struggle for liberation and revolution.

    Rodger Dose of the Cambodian Journalists Delegation, when talking about how to deal with the evil activities of US imperialism and its running dogs, said, "Our policy is a policy of retaliation, namely, 'an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.'" If our enemies continue to launch regional attacks, we will retaliate with the same regional counterattacks. If our enemies are determined to invade us, then we, like the people of South Vietnam, will retaliate with a patriotic people's war, that is, a form of struggle that no imperialist army in the world can ever defeat.

    Pera Muniti Tileke, head of the delegation of the Ceylon Journalists' Association, condemned in his speech those pseudo-revolutionaries who collude with US imperialism and betray the cause of freedom-loving people around the world. He said that these people desperately promote that they support the heroic liberation struggle of the Vietnamese people, but at the same time praise the US imperialists, attempting to deceive the Vietnamese people to the conference table. In our struggle against imperialism, our bounden duty is to expose these traitors of the cause of the people of all countries, these double-dealing pseudo-revolutionaries who attempt to deceive the people with their so-called policy of "peaceful coexistence"; we know that these traitors have become the despicable salesmen of Johnson's "peace fraud" and "unconditional discussions". Muniti Tileke also requested that this meeting condemn in the strongest terms the pro-American regime in Indonesia and its horrific and fascist crimes against the innocent patriotic people of Indonesia.

    各国和地区代表在亚非记协书记处会议上谴责美帝侵略政策
    加强亚非新闻工作者的战斗友谊
    据新华社二十二日讯　出席亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议（扩大）的越南等七个国家和地区的代表，在二十一日举行的全体会议上发了言。他们谴责以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的侵略政策和战争政策，强调要进一步加强亚非人民和新闻工作者的战斗友谊。
    代表们在发言中，表示支持亚非新闻工作者协会书记处暂时撤离雅加达，并且高度评价了亚非新闻工作者协会在反对帝国主义和维护世界和平事业中所作的贡献。
    来自反帝斗争前线的这些代表的发言，博得了全场热烈的掌声。
    越南南方爱国民主新闻工作者协会代表团团长黄万里首先在会上发言。他走上讲台的时候，各国代表们热烈鼓掌，向英雄的越南南方人民致意。
    黄万里在发言中说，越南南方人民的抗美救国斗争完全证明，人民战争是无敌的。越南南方人民坚决紧握枪杆子，定将埋葬美国侵略者和它的走狗。
    黄万里说，当前在越南南方必须解决的问题是：美帝国主义必须从越南南方撤出全部美国军队、军事人员和各种武器，撤销它在越南南方的美国军事基地，废除它同南越缔结的军事联盟，停止执行侵略南越的政策，让越南人民自己解决越南南方的问题。
    黄万里发言以后，他向会议献了越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜，和南越军民打下的美国强盗飞机的残片。亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多和许多国家的代表，同黄万里热烈拥抱，全场掌声雷动。
    越南新闻工作者协会代表团团长刘贵淇在发言中说，越南人民坚信我们正在遵循的抗美救国路线和人民战争路线。不管要战斗五年、十年或二十年，我们也要决心战斗到最后胜利。刘贵淇和黄万里在发言中都强烈谴责了美帝国主义及其走狗在印度尼西亚发动军事政变，镇压印度尼西亚爱国者的罪行。他们都指出，印度尼西亚人民正在进行不屈的斗争，光辉灿烂的未来定将属于一亿印度尼西亚人民。
    刘贵淇在讲话以后，向会议赠送了一部艺术影片《二十年》。影片描述了从越南民主共和国成立到一九六五年的二十年中，越南青年进行的英勇斗争。
    巴勒斯坦解放组织新闻工作者代表团代表马津·班达克在发言中指出，中东现在面临着新的伟大的革命斗争浪潮。帝国主义注定要在我们的手下灭亡。他说，民族解放运动除了战斗之外没有别的路可走。班达克讲话以后，代表巴勒斯坦解放组织新闻工作者代表团，向会议赠送了反映巴勒斯坦人民苦难和斗争的绘画。
    刚果（利）全国解放委员会代表团团长塞巴斯蒂安·拉马扎尼在发言中，强烈谴责美帝国主义在刚果（利）和越南残酷屠杀手无寸铁的居民的滔天罪行。他说，在全国解放委员会领导下拿起武器的刚果（利）全体人民，坚定不移地决心使美国的所有这些罪恶和疯狂的目的无法得逞。拉马扎尼讲话以后，向会议赠送了揭露美帝国主义屠杀和压迫刚果人民罪行的雕塑。
    阿尔及利亚新闻工作者代表团团长贝拉朱格在发言中说，我要同越南北方和南越、巴勒斯坦和刚果（利）的兄弟人民的代表们一起，同声谴责美帝国主义者和他们的走狗所进行的窒息人民愿望的最残酷尝试。他赞扬越南、刚果、巴勒斯坦、罗得西亚、莫三鼻给、南非的兄弟人民和在非洲、亚洲、拉丁美洲以及在阿拉伯世界的其他人民，今天正位于解放和革命斗争的前列。
    柬埔寨新闻工作者代表团团长罗杰多在谈到如何对待美帝国主义及其走狗的罪恶活动时说，我们的政策是进行报复的政策，即“以眼还眼，以牙还牙”。如果我们的敌人继续进行区域性攻击，我们将以同样的区域性反攻回击他们。如果我们的敌人决心要侵犯我们，那么，我们就象南越人民那样以爱国的人民战争，即是以世界上任何帝国主义的军队永远不能战胜的斗争形式来回击他们。
    锡兰新闻工作者协会代表团团长佩拉·穆尼蒂莱克在发言中谴责那些假革命者同美帝国主义勾结，背叛世界上爱好自由的人民的事业。他说，这些人拼命宣传他们是支持越南人民的英勇解放斗争的，可是同时又赞扬美帝国主义者，企图把越南人民骗到会议桌旁。在我们同帝国主义者进行斗争的时候，我们的义不容辞的义务是揭露各国人民事业的这些背叛者，这些两面三刀的假革命者，他们企图以他们所谓的“和平共处”政策来欺骗人民；我们知道，这些叛徒已经成了约翰逊的“和平骗局”和“无条件讨论”的卑鄙推销员。穆尼蒂莱克还要求这次会议以最强烈的措词谴责印度尼西亚的亲美政权和它对印度尼西亚无辜的爱国人民犯下的恐怖和法西斯罪行。
