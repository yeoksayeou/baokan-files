    Editor's Note: After launching a counter-revolutionary military coup, the Indonesian right-wing generals' clique frenziedly suppressed patriotic forces and savagely slaughtered the people, fully exposing themselves as a gang of cold-blooded fascist executioners. Today, we compile excerpts from foreign newspapers and periodicals that partially expose their heinous crimes.

    Throughout history, both ancient and modern, all reactionaries have attempted to maintain their reactionary rule by relying on killing. However, no reactionary has ever achieved their goal. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang ruled China for more than twenty years, slaughtering millions of communists and revolutionary people. After the surrender of Japanese imperialism, they launched a great bloody war under the support and command of American imperialism, killing millions more Chinese. The time when he killed most frantically was the time when he was about to collapse. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "All kinds of persecution they inflict on the revolutionary people can only promote broader and more intense revolution among the people." The Chinese reactionaries ended up collapsing completely. The Indonesian reactionaries can only meet the same fate.

    According to Xinhua News Agency on the 19th, since the beginning of October last year, reactionary forces in Indonesia have stirred up a violent counter-current against communism and against the people throughout the country. Using the most barbaric fascist means, they carried out mass arrests and massacres, bloodying Indonesia and turning this beautiful and rich archipelago into a living hell rampant with white terror. In just a few months, they slaughtered hundreds of thousands of Indonesian patriots and innocent elderly, weak, women, and children, committing shocking and heinous crimes.

    The following are excerpts from relevant reports and articles from Western and Japanese news agencies and newspapers (including individual Indonesian right-wing newspapers). Although they cannot fully reflect the truth, even from these materials, one can see a glimpse of the fascist atrocities of mass arrests and massacres by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces.

    Door-to-Door and Village-to-Village Mass Arrests and Massacres

    Japan's *Asahi Shimbun* published a message from its Jakarta correspondent on October 8th of last year, saying: "From the evening of October 2nd, soldiers have been conducting house-to-house searches every night. Especially in remote streets and poor people's residential areas (Jakarta's slums, with a total population of nearly two million)... It seems to have been subjected to particularly strict searches... It is rumored that people have seen trucks transporting corpses, and it is also rumored that some neighbors have suddenly disappeared."

    Agence France-Presse (AFP) Jakarta dispatch on October 31st said: "The island nation's prisons are filled with arrested supporters of the communist coup... The army resolutely continues its mopping-up operations, searching village after village. ...The army has drawn up plans to establish temporary concentration camps for detaining communists on Onrust Island, not far from Jakarta, and Nusa Kambangan Island near the south coast of Central Java."

    AFP Jakarta dispatch on November 9th said: "The army's large-scale cleansing and search for supporters of the communist coup continues unabated. According to reliable sources, about 5,000 arrested communists have been detained on Onrust Island alone. (The Dutch used this island as a detention camp before; it is located near the north coast of West Java, close to Tanjung Priok port in Jakarta.) At the same time, the army's mopping-up operations are still vigorously carried out in Central Java and West Java. Villages are carefully searched one after another. Communist village chiefs and other local communists are arrested."

    Corpses Exposed in the Wilderness, Rivers of Blood

    AFP Singapore dispatch on December 29th said: "In the cruel wave of retaliation against communists in Indonesia, tens of thousands of people have been slaughtered. ...The estimate of 100,000 people killed in the mass executions and massacres in Java, Sumatra, Bali, and throughout Indonesia will be a conservative figure. ...This massacre intensified four or five weeks ago and spread to most parts of Indonesia. Some prisoners have been executed on a large scale, leaving them at the mercy of angry mobs (counter-revolutionaries - editor). Spontaneous massacres broke out. ...The military authorities in Bali admitted to officially executing 15,000 people, but observers say that the number of burnt houses – mortuaries – in Bali proves that the number of deaths is at least twice the above figure. ...In Sumatra, more than 60,000 people have now been killed. The number of people killed in Central Java and East Java may be even higher. ...On December 18, President Sukarno complained that people's bodies were left to rot in ditches, waterways, and fields along the highways without receiving Islamic burial."

    Associated Press (AP) said in a message on January 13th of this year: "The news that more than 100,000 communists and their sympathizers have been killed in Indonesia is a very conservative estimate. ...A more likely figure is around 150,000. ...In North Sumatra alone, 1,000 communists and sympathizers are killed every week. ...The killing is very fierce in the Medan area. ...Some parts of the Medan River were once blocked by corpses. This largest-scale cleansing of communists and their sympathizers was carried out by the army."

    Three Months of Bloody Record

    Britain's *Sunday Times* reported on January 2nd: "The number of people killed in the riots in Indonesia in the past three months is more than the number of people who have died in the Vietnam War in the past five years... Western diplomatic officials conservatively estimate that the number of deaths in the 'massacre of communists' is about 100,000. European engineers, businessmen, and other foreign travelers returning from the mainland... talked about rivers full of floating decapitated corpses."

    Britain's *The Times* published an article on January 8th entitled "Continued Mass Slaughter of Indonesian Communists," saying: "This month, news of the continued widespread and relentless suppression of the Indonesian Communist Party by nationalists – especially Muslim youth organizations – has continued to reach the outside world. Now, estimates of the number of people killed vary widely, from 10,000 to 300,000. ...In addition to executions, tens of thousands of people have been arrested – 2,500 have been arrested in East Java, where about 5,700 teachers have also been purged; 10,573 have been arrested in West Java, of whom about 10,000 are said to be communists, and the rest are government officials."

    Uninhabited Villages After the Massacre

    An article published in Indonesia's *Sinar Harapan* on February 3rd regarding the situation in East Java said: "Going to East Java is indeed a bit worrying, because we have been influenced by some rumors that sound frightening. Everywhere there are people (counter-revolutionaries - editor) defending the Republic of Indonesia under the Five Principles of Nationhood under President Sukarno, collectively hunting down communists and killing communists. Newspapers dare not report these things in detail, for fear of affecting people's emotions. ...Whether in Surabaya, or in Pasuruan, Probolinggo, Madiun, Kediri, and Malang, we have heard about the truly terrible things that happened in the process of crushing the September 30th Movement, things that we have never seen in the newspapers. And now I feel embarrassed to talk about it here. ...In the process of crushing the September 30th Movement, it was often manipulated by elements with personal emotions, criminals, and exploiters. ...The scene in the countryside, whether day or night, is silent, like an uninhabited village. Villagers are very uneasy for fear of arresting the wrong person. The village office's large kerosene lamp is no longer lit, and the street lights are off. Villagers will be terrified when they hear the sound of a car entering the village."

    Contemporary Unparalleled Massacre

    France's *Le Nouvel Observateur* published an article on March 2nd saying: "For four months, this country has been subjected to a virtual bloodbath, an unimaginable massacre, unparalleled in modern times. Sukarno said in a speech on January 15th that 87,000 people had been killed; those who knew the inside story at the time said 200,000 had died. Today, the estimate considered conservative is about 300,000 to 350,000. All of them were 'communists' or considered to be such. In East Java, dozens of headless corpses float down the river every day, and farmers move the corpses to the highlands on the side of the railway for guests to identify. It is well known that in Bali, the repression is cruel and merciless; in North Sumatra and some neighboring areas, thousands of victims are killed, and the stench emitted by the unburied corpses forces the authorities to take 'certain sanitary measures.' This is how anti-communist generals and their advisors used the 'September 30th Incident' to launch what some call the 'physical elimination' of the Indonesian Communist Party."

    Britain's *The Guardian* published a message from Jakarta by Nicholas Turner on April 7th entitled "Indonesian Political Massacre Toll May Exceed 300,000," saying: "As the news coming from the outer regions becomes more and more complete, people are changing the estimates of the total number of Indonesians killed in the political massacre following the September 30th abortive coup. One Western ambassador believes that 300,000 is a conservative estimate, and other statistics are much higher. A traveler who is very familiar with Bali and speaks the local language said that large numbers of people have been executed in some areas and one village after another has been wiped out. A consulate official in Surabaya agreed that 200,000 people had been killed in Bali. The population of Bali is two million. It is estimated that the death toll in Sumatra also reached 200,000, and it is generally believed that similar figures are low estimates for Java. When the death toll on other islands such as Borneo (Kalimantan) and Sulawesi is increasing, the total death toll is likely to be over 600,000. How many of these people are communists is another question. It seems certain that the vast majority of those killed were innocent victims of political hysteria. ...In this chaos, many other people probably died in resolving private feuds and family feuds. In some areas, communist suspects were shot or poisoned, but Muslim youths usually used daggers to cut off the heads of their victims. These people's heads are often tied to fences and doorposts. ...In many parts of the country, rivers have been blocked by corpses for weeks. A European resident of Surabaya said he saw the river wash corpses into his backyard."

    Kill on Sight, Whole Family Executed

    Britain's *The Times* published a report on April 13th by its special correspondent who recently visited Indonesia entitled "The Reign of Terror in Java," saying: "An Indonesian general told me that the highest number of massacres was 150,000, and some diplomats believed it was 500,000. ...Large numbers of people were massacred almost silently in this large and silent country. When I arrived in Indonesia, it was difficult to get first-hand, eyewitness accounts of the massacre. I happened to meet a person from Central Java, and I suddenly asked him to recount the scene of the organized massacre he participated in on the grounds of 'understanding Indonesia'."

    He said that the army arrived at the end of October. ...They began to search for communists and their families. He continued, "This is killing on sight at night. We surrounded their houses... killed everyone in the house with knives... although the army occasionally shot those who tried to escape... We killed about 3,000 people in total. We threw their bodies into the river or into the jungle." The man added: "This time we must make sure to get everyone, to prevent a comeback. ...That's why our whole family was executed." This person was not boasting, and I don't think he was lying.

    The Massacre Has Not Ended

    *The New York Times* published an article from Jakarta by Sulzberger on April 13th saying: "One of the worst massacres in history has not ended in Indonesia. More people have been killed here in the past six months than in the entire Vietnam War. It is impossible to provide an accurate number of people killed. A prudent diplomat estimates the total number to be 300,000. Other estimates are even higher."

    "This quiet capital calls this important political revolution (referring to the military coup in which the right-wing generals' clique seized state power - editor) a 'polite Javanese coup.' This coup politely left President Sukarno nominally in power, while actually depriving him of his power. But there is nothing polite about the massacres that have taken place and are still taking place in the mainland. Officials have tried to downplay its scale and claim that this terrible event has come to an end. However, from Sumatra to Timor, the massacre has reached a shocking scale even in riot-torn Asia where human lives are cheap. In February, public decapitations were still taking place outside Ende, the capital of Flores Island. Every night, soldiers used trucks to transport batches (more than 20 people in each batch) of Indonesian communist suspects from prison to outside the city, where they were beheaded with machetes. ...Men and their wives and children were killed together to eliminate those who harbored grievances, thereby reducing the possibility of revenge in the future. ...Near Surabaya, people who got up early in March pushed the corpses away from the breakwaters in front of their houses. It is said that the prisons near Yogyakarta are full of Indonesian communist suspects who are not tried, but are taken out in batches at night and killed. Recently, unburied corpses were scattered on the streets of a village in Central Java. Recently, a traveler was told that there was an ox cart full of heads."

    屠杀绝不能阻止革命前进　血债一定要用鲜血来偿还
    印尼右派疯狂屠杀罪恶滔天逃脱不了惩罚
    编者按：印度尼西亚右派将领集团在发动反革命军事政变之后，疯狂镇压爱国力量，野蛮屠杀人民群众，充分暴露了他们是一伙杀人不眨眼的法西斯刽子手。今天我们辑录的外国报刊所作的片断报道，部分地揭露了他们的滔天罪行。
    古今中外，一切反动派都曾经企图依靠杀人来保持他们的反动统治。但是，没有那一个反动派曾经达到他们的目的。蒋介石匪帮统治中国二十多年，屠杀了千千万万共产党人和革命人民。日本帝国主义投降以后，他们在美帝国主义支持和指挥之下发起的一场大血战中，又杀了几百万中国人。他杀人最疯狂的时候，也就是他要最后完蛋的时候。毛泽东同志说过，“他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命”。中国反动派落得一个最后完蛋的下场，印度尼西亚反动派也只能是这样的下场。
    据新华社十九日讯　印度尼西亚反动势力从去年十月初以来，在全国范围内掀起了一个反共反人民的狂暴逆流，以最野蛮的法西斯手段，实行大逮捕、大屠杀，血洗印度尼西亚，把这个美丽富饶的千岛之国，变成了一座白色恐怖猖獗的人间地狱。他们在短短的几个月内，屠杀了数以十万计的印度尼西亚爱国者和无辜老弱妇孺，犯下了骇人听闻的滔天罪行。
    下面发表的是西方和日本的通讯社、报刊（包括个别印度尼西亚右派报纸）的部分有关的报道和文章的辑录。它们虽然不能完全反映事情真相，但就是从这些材料里，也可以看到印度尼西亚右派反动势力大逮捕、大屠杀法西斯暴行的一斑。
    挨户挨村大逮捕、大屠杀
    日本《朝日新闻》去年十月八日刊登它的驻雅加达记者的消息说：从十月二日夜晚起，每天晚间都有士兵挨家挨户进行搜索。特别在偏僻的街巷穷人聚居地区（雅加达的贫民区，人口总数将近二百万）……好象遭到了特别严厉的搜索……传说，有人看到搬运尸体的卡车，还传说有的邻居突然不见了。
    法新社十月三十一日雅加达消息说：这个岛国的监狱里关满了被捕的共产党政变支持者……陆军坚决地继续进行扫荡，一个村庄接着一个村庄进行搜查。……陆军已经拟定出计划，要在离雅加达不远的昂拉斯特岛和中爪哇南岸附近努沙甘邦安岛建立拘留共产党人的临时集中营。
    法新社十一月九日雅加达消息说：陆军的大清洗和搜寻共产党政变支持者的工作继续进行，毫未放松。据从可靠方面获悉，光在昂拉斯特岛就拘留了约五千名被捕的共产党人。（荷兰人以前用这个岛作为拘留营，它在西爪哇北海岸附近，靠近雅加达的丹戎不碌港。）同时，陆军的扫荡活动仍在中爪哇和西爪哇大力进行。村庄一个接一个被仔细搜索。共产党村长和当地其他共产党人被逮捕起来。
    暴尸荒野　血流成河
    法新社十二月二十九日新加坡消息说：在印度尼西亚对共产党人进行报复的残酷的浪潮中，有成千上万的人遭到屠杀。……在爪哇、苏门答腊、巴厘和整个印度尼西亚的大规模处决和屠杀行动中，已被打死的人达十万人的估计数字将是保守的数字。……这种大屠杀在四、五星期以前加剧了，而且扩大到印度尼西亚的大部分地区。已经大规模处决了一些犯人，让这些犯人听任愤怒的群众（反革命分子——编者）摆布。爆发了自发的屠杀事件。……巴厘的军事当局承认官方共处决了一万五千人，但是观察家们说，巴厘被烧掉的住宅——存尸所数目证明死的人的数目至少有上述数字的两倍。……在苏门答腊，现在被杀死的人达六万多人，在中爪哇和东爪哇，被打死的人的数字可能更高。……十二月十八日，苏加诺总统抱怨让人们的尸体在公路沿途的壕沟里、河道里和田野里腐烂掉，而没有得到伊斯兰葬礼的待遇。
    美联社今年一月十三日在一条消息中说：所传印度尼西亚有十万多名共产党及其同情者被杀死的消息，是非常保守的估计。……可能性更大的数字是十五万人上下。……单单在北苏门答腊，每周就有一千名共产党及同情者被杀死。……在棉兰地区杀人杀得非常凶。……棉兰河的一些部分一度被死尸堵塞了。这次最大规模的清洗共产党及其同情者的行动是陆军进行的。
    三个月的血腥记录
    英国《星期日泰晤士报》一月二日报道说：在过去三个月里在印度尼西亚暴乱中被杀死的人，比过去五年里在越南战争中死亡的人还要多……西方外交官员们保守的估计在“大规模屠杀共产党人中”死亡的人数约为十万。从内地回来的欧洲工程师、商人和其他外国旅行者……谈到了河上充满了漂浮的被杀头的尸体。
    英国《泰晤士报》一月八日以《继续大规模屠杀印度尼西亚共产党人》为题发表文章说：在本月，关于民族主义者——特别是穆斯林青年组织——对印度尼西亚共产党继续进行广泛的和无情的镇压的消息，不断地传到外界。现在关于被杀死的人数的估计众说不一，从一万人到三十万人。……除了进行处决以外，还逮捕了成千上万的人——在东爪哇逮捕了二千五百人，那里还有大约五千七百名教师被清洗；在西爪哇逮捕了一万零五百七十三人，据说其中约有一万名共产党人，其余的人是政府官员。
    大屠杀后的无人村
    印度尼西亚《希望之光报》二月三日刊登的一篇关于东爪哇局势的文章说：出门去东爪哇，的确是有些顾虑，因为受到了一些听起来令人胆战心惊的流言蜚语的影响。到处都有保卫在苏加诺总统领导下的建国五项原则的印尼共和国的人民群众（反革命分子——编者），集体追捕共产党人和杀死共产党人。报纸不敢详细报道这些事，怕会影响人们的情绪。……无论在泗水，还是在岩望、庞越、茉莉芬、柬义里和玛琅，我们都听说了有关在粉碎九月三十日运动过程中发生的真令人可怕的事，这些事都是我们在报纸上从来没有见过的。而现在想在这里来谈，也感到为难。……在粉碎九月三十日运动中，常常为抱着个人情绪的分子、刑事犯和剥削分子所操纵。……农村的情景，无论是白天还是黑夜，一片寂静，象是无人村似的。村民怕会抓错人而感到非常不安。村公所的大汽灯不再亮了，路灯熄灭了。村民一听到汽车进村的声音，就会吓得胆战心惊。
    当代无与伦比的大屠杀
    法国《新观察家》三月二日发表文章说：四个月来，这个国家几乎是遭到一次真正的血洗，遭到一次难以想象的屠杀，这种屠杀在当代还是无与伦比的。苏加诺一月十五日在一篇演说里说杀死了八万七千人；熟知内情的人当时说死了二十万人。今天，被认为是保守的估计，大约是死了三十万人到三十五万人。死的都是“共产党人”或者被认为是这种人。在东爪哇，河里每天都要漂下来几十个的无头尸体，农民们把尸体搬到铁路一边的高地上，好叫客人们辨认。众所周知，在巴厘，镇压是残酷无情的，在北苏门答腊和一些邻近地区，牺牲者数以千计，没有掩埋的尸体所散放出的臭味迫使当局不得不采取“某些卫生措施”。反共将领们及其顾问们就是这样利用“九月三十日事件”发动了有人称之为“从肉体上消灭”印度尼西亚共产党的事件。
    英国《卫报》四月七日刊登了尼古拉斯·特纳从雅加达发出的题为《印度尼西亚政治屠杀人数可能超过三十万》的消息说：随着从外部地区传来的消息越来越充分，人们正在改变关于在九月三十日未遂政变后的政治屠杀中被杀害的印度尼西亚人总的数字的估计。有一位西方大使认为三十万人是一个保守的估计，其他的统计数字要高得多。有一个非常熟悉巴厘岛并且会说当地话的旅行者说，在一些地区处决了大批的人并灭绝一个又一个村庄。泗水的一位领事馆官员同意巴厘有二十万人被杀害的数字。巴厘人口为二百万。估计苏门答腊死亡人数也达到二十万，人们普遍认为类似的数字对爪哇来说是偏低的估计。当其他岛如婆罗（加里曼丹）和苏拉威西的死亡人数在增加的时候，死亡总数很可能在六十万以上。这些人中究竟有多少是共产党人这是另一个问题。看来可以肯定，这些被杀害的人中绝大多数是政治歇斯底里的无辜牺牲者。……在这一混乱当中，许多其他的人大概是在解决私人不和以及家族仇恨中死去的。有些地区，共产党的嫌疑分子被枪杀或被毒死，但是穆斯林青年通常是用短刀来砍他们的受害者的脑袋。常常把这些人的头颅绑在篱笆上和门柱上。……在这个国家许多地方河流数周来被尸体所堵塞。泗水一个欧洲籍的居民说，他看到河水把尸体冲进他的后花园里。
    见人就杀　全家抄斩
    英国《泰晤士报》四月十三日发表该报最近去过印度尼西亚的特派记者的一篇题为《爪哇的恐怖统治》的报道说：一位印度尼西亚将军告诉我，大屠杀的最高数字是十五万，一些外交家相信是五十万。……大批人在这个大而沉寂的国家几乎是无声无息地被屠杀了。我到印度尼西亚时，很难得到第一手的亲眼看到的屠杀情况。我碰巧遇到一位从中爪哇来的人，我以“了解印度尼西亚”为由，突然要求他重述一下他所参与的有组织的屠杀的情景。
    他说，十月底，陆军抵达了。……开始搜寻共产党人和他们的家属。他接着说，“这是在晚上见人就杀。我们包围了他们的家……用刀子杀死屋里所有的人……虽然军队偶尔也枪杀企图逃跑的人……我们一共杀了大约三千人。我们把他们的尸体扔到河里，或扔到丛林里。”那人补充说：“这次我们必须确保搞到每个人，以防东山再起。……我们全家抄斩的原因就在于此”。这个人不是吹嘘，我也不认为他是撒谎。
    屠杀尚未结束
    《纽约时报》四月十三日刊登的苏兹贝格从雅加达发的一篇文章说：历史上最严重的一次屠杀在印尼尚未结束。过去六个月在这里杀死的人，比在整个越南战争中杀死的还要多。不可能提供关于被杀人数的确切数字。一位谨慎的外交人士估计总数是三十万。其它的估计还要高。
    这个安静的首都称这个重要的政治革命（指右派将领集团夺取国家政权的军事政变——编者）是“爪哇人有礼貌的政变”。这个政变很客气地使苏加诺总统在表面上仍然掌握政权，而实际上则剥夺了他的权力。但是对于在内地已进行的并仍在进行的大规模屠杀，则没有什么客气之处。官员们企图缩小它的规模，并声称这个可怕的事件已告结束。可是，从苏门答腊到帝汶，屠杀已达到了在人命不值钱的暴乱亚洲也是令人震惊的规模。在二月，在佛罗勒斯岛首府英德外面仍然在公开砍头。每天晚上，士兵用卡车从狱中运出一批批（每批二十多人）印尼共嫌疑分子到市外，用大刀把他们斩首。……男子和他们的妻孥一起被杀掉，以消灭抱有委屈的人，从而减少在以后报仇的可能性。……在泗水附近，三月份早起的人把尸体从他们房前的防波堤推开。据说日惹附近的监狱塞满了印尼共嫌疑分子，他们没有受审，而是在晚上分批拉出去杀死了。最近在中爪哇村庄的街道上散乱着没有埋葬的尸体。最近有一位旅行者被告诉说，有一个牛车装满了人头。
