Title: Sailing Through Wind and Snow

    The biting sea wind whips across the deck,
    Snowflakes swirl in clumps,
    The fog forms a watery wall,
    Our warship is a speeding castle.
    Waves crash onto the deck,
    Instantly freezing into sheets of ice,
    Quick, scrape with the blade, hammer with the mallet,
    Or else, ice mountains will rise on the ship.
    The wind is fierce, the waves are high,
    Crest and trough rising and falling,
    Even with two windbreak ropes pulled tight,
    The wind and waves don’t slow their pace.
    On deck, shivering with cold,
    In the cabin, sweating with heat,
    This steel deck,
    Seems to be the dividing line between the tropics and the arctic.
    One moment, jumping from the ice and snow into a hot furnace,
    The next, jumping from the hot furnace into ice and snow mountains,
    A second experiences both winter and summer,
    Sailors are training hard!
    Several days and several nights,
    Three more days until we reach the "front line",
    Washing feet only with seawater,
    Fresh water, only a small bowl allotted each day.
    Fear it not, snow flying and filling the sea,
    Fear it not, tenth-grade typhoon howling,
    Fear it not, ten thousand acres of sea in a misty haze,
    Fear it not, a thousand layers of raging waves blocking the way.
    Every sailor has Chairman Mao's books in hand,
    The lighthouse in our hearts shines thousands of miles,
    Breaking through the wind, snow, and waves of the sea,
    Will be a brighter sky with colorful clouds holding up the sun!

    风雪远航	纪　鹏
    凛冽的海风卷过甲板，
    鹅毛大雪一团团，
    雾的围墙水蒙蒙，
    飞驰的城堡是我们的战舰。
    浪山跌落在甲板上，
    刹时结成冰一片，
    快用刮刀刮，铁锤敲，
    要不，舰上也要耸冰山。
    风好紧呵浪好大，
    浪峰浪谷上下颠，
    纵然拉起两条防风索，
    风浪的脚步也没放慢。
    甲板上，冻得打战战，
    舱室里，热得直淌汗，
    这道钢铁的甲板呵，
    象是热带和寒带的分界线。
    一会儿，从冰雪中跳进高温炉，
    一会儿，从高温炉中跳进冰雪山，
    一秒钟经历了冬和夏，
    水兵们在顽强地训练！
    几个白天又几个夜晚，
    还得三天才能到“前线”，
    洗脚只能用海水，
    淡水呵，每天只分一小碗。
    不怕它，大雪飞扬漫天海，
    不怕它，十级台风呼又喊，
    不怕它，万顷海上雾茫茫，
    不怕它，千层恶浪把路拦。
    水兵手上都有毛主席的书，
    心上的灯塔能照千里远，
    冲破大海的风、雪、浪，
    将是个彩云托日更明朗的天！
