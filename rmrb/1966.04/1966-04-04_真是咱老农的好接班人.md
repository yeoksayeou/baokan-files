    Truly Good Successors to Us Old Farmers
    Narrated by Li Cai, Old Vegetable Farmer of Xinchen Farm, Erdaohanzi District, Changchun City
    I am fifty-five years old this year and have been growing vegetables my whole life. In recent years, I often thought: the vegetables are growing crop after crop, and people are getting older year after year. The farm currently has more than eight hundred members, and more than half are over fifty years old. The Second Team always takes the lead in spring and autumn vegetables, but the summer vegetables can't keep up. One of the reasons is that the technology can't keep up, and seedlings can't be cultivated. Growing vegetables cannot be done without water and fertilizer, nor can it be done without technical expertise. How can we do without some young people to take over our jobs in the future? Later, two groups of graduates from the horticultural school came, and the knot in my heart was finally untied.
    Dong Chongwu, who came in the first group, is now a technician. He studied vegetable growing at school and worked with old farmers for more than two years. He already had a foundation, and he understood everything quickly when he came here. The cucumbers, cabbages, and tomatoes he cultivated the year before last were among the best in the farm. After the farm director and secretary saw them, they also held a technician on-site meeting to let everyone see them. At that time, someone said to me, your title of "Cucumber King" is about to be lost. I said, I am willing to lose it. Jiang Yingfa, a graduate of the second group, has only been in the Eleventh Team for less than half a year, and now he can stand alone. He uses nutrient soil to cultivate seedlings, and they grow very well. The young man has a real drive, is not afraid of hardship, and moved into the greenhouse for more than a month. He can also find ways to exercise the seedlings. The celery in their team grows particularly strong and goes on the market four or five days earlier. Although the five acres of cucumbers suffered hail damage, they still harvested 20% more than the neighboring team. More than fifty male and female members of the team all praise Little Jiang.
    In the future, growing vegetables will also require machines, and we will also have to implement the "Four Modernizations." Without culture, we cannot modernize. To increase the yield per unit area, we must conduct scientific experiments. It is difficult for someone like me, who has no culture, to conduct experiments. Because I can't keep records, the experiment is forgotten after the experiment. Last year, there were four horticultural school graduates in the Fourth Team, and they conducted many scientific experiments from spring to autumn. The cucumber dense planting they experimented with increased the early-stage yield by several times compared to the general planting method, and the total output value increased by more than double compared to the general planting method. The students from horticultural school are all outstanding. These young people are not afraid of tiredness or dirt when they work, and they also have a spirit of perseverance. They are truly useful wherever they are needed and can do anything.
    At first, I was a little puzzled as to where these young men got such great abilities. Later I realized that they were studying in school as part-time farmers and part-time students. I think this method is good. While studying, they also labor, so young people are not prone to becoming lazy and slippery. What they learn from books can also be used in labor and is not forgotten. These students have good roots and are upright, and each one is useful and will be in charge in the future. They have culture, technology, and feelings for the peasants, so people can trust them. With such good successors, I, the old vegetable farmer, can rest assured even if I retire.

    真是咱老农的好接班人
    长春市二道河子区新晨农场老菜农　李才　口述
    我今年五十五岁了，种了一辈子菜。前几年常寻思：菜在一茬一茬地长，人也在一年一年地老。农场现有社员八百多人，年过半百的一半多。二队每年春菜、秋菜都占先，可就是夏菜上不去，原因之一就是技术跟不上去，不能养苗子。种菜没有水、肥不行，没有技术力量也不行。将来没有一些小青年来接我们的班怎么能行呢？后来园艺学校来了两期毕业生，我心里这个疙瘩才算解开了。
    第一期来的董崇武，现在已经当了技术员。他在学校学过种菜，又跟老农干了二年多，原先就有个底儿，来到这儿一点就透。前年他育的黄瓜、大头菜、西红柿都是场里数一数二的。场长、书记看了后，还召开了一次技术员现场会，让大伙都看看。当时有人说我，你这个“黄瓜大王”要保不住了。我说，保不住我也心甘情愿。第二期毕业生江迎发，来到十一队不到半年的光景，现在也能独当一面了。他使用营养土方育苗，长的很好。小伙子真有一股劲儿，不怕吃苦，搬到温室里住了一个多月。他还能想法子锻炼小苗，他们队的芹菜长的特别壮，提早四五天上市。五亩地的黄瓜虽然遭了雹灾，还比邻队多收两成。队里五十多名男女社员，没有不夸小江的。
    往后种菜也要用机器，还要搞四化，没有文化可化不了。要提高单位面积产量，就得搞科学试验，象我这样没有文化的人，搞试验也有困难。因为不会做记录，试验试验就忘了。去年四队有四个园艺学校的毕业生，从春到秋搞了很多科学试验。他们试验的黄瓜密植，前期产量比一般种法增加好几成，总产值比一般种法增加一倍多。园艺学校出来的学生，真是一个赛一个。这些年轻人，干起活来不怕累，不怕脏，还有一股子钻劲。真是哪用哪到，干啥都行。
    起先，我有点纳闷，这些小伙子哪里来的这么大的本事呢？后来我才明白，他们在学校念书时就是半农半读，我看这种办法就是好。一边念书一边劳动，年轻人就不容易变懒变滑，从书本上学到的东西，劳动时也能用得上，也忘不了。这些学生苗好根正，个个顶用，将来都是一把手。他们有文化，有技术，和农民有感情，叫人信得过。有了这样的好接班人，我这个老菜农，就是交了班也放心了。
