    Hold High the Banner of Anti-Imperialist Struggle and Vigorously Support the National Liberation Movements of Asia, Africa and Latin America
    The Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association Holds a Plenary Meeting in Beijing
    Secretary-General Djawoto said that the AAJA firmly supports the people of all countries in opposing imperialism headed by the United States and its running dogs. Vice Mayor Wan Li said that this meeting will enhance the unity of the Asian and African people and contribute to the anti-imperialist cause of the world's people.
    New China News Agency, April 20th. The Fourth Plenary Meeting (Enlarged) of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association solemnly opened in Beijing today.
    Secretary-General Djawoto of the Asian-African Journalists Association presided over the opening ceremony and delivered a speech at the meeting. He emphasized that the task of this meeting is that the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association, which holds high the banner of anti-imperialist struggle, should put the issue of fighting imperialism, especially US imperialism, as the first item on the agenda of the meeting. We must discuss how to better contribute to the struggle of the peoples of all countries; our future activities; the location of the Secretariat and the Second Asian-African Journalists Conference. This meeting will vigorously support the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa and Latin America, and further expose the enemies of the peoples of all countries and their conspiracies.
    Vice Mayor Wan Li of Beijing was invited to attend the opening ceremony and delivered a speech.
    At the opening ceremony, a letter from Cambodian Head of State Prince Norodom Sihanouk to the Asian-African Journalists Association was also read.
    The opening ceremony was held at 4 pm. In the center of the venue hung the emblem of the Asian-African Journalists Association, flanked by the flags of the countries participating in the meeting.
    In his speech, Djawoto said, "Because we worked together, we were finally able to hold this important meeting of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association. This alone is already a success. We all know that since its establishment, the Asian-African Journalists Association has been the target of various attacks and slander campaigns by imperialists and their running dogs all over the world, as well as all reactionaries, including those who tout themselves as progressives and revolutionaries. But this is something we must be grateful for. As long as all reactionaries hate us, we have ample reason to be grateful. The more they hate us, the better. At the same time, the Asian-African Journalists Association has always devoted its strength and all its activities to the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America who are struggling for complete national independence and revolutionary journalism. We have always used our pens to benefit the people's struggle. Therefore, the Asian-African Journalists Association has always been, and will continue to be, loved by the people who are fighting imperialism and new and old colonialism, which is logical. Therefore, despite the obstruction and sabotage of various reactionaries, we have achieved greater and greater success."
    He said that the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association is holding a meeting at a time that is very conducive to the struggle of the peoples of all countries against imperialist aggression and domination. The national liberation movements in Asia, Africa and Latin America, especially armed struggles, are rising to an unprecedented height in the struggle against the imperialist war, aggression, subversion and control policies headed by US imperialism. The main contradiction in the current world is the contradiction between the oppressed people and countries and imperialism, and this main contradiction is concentrated in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The struggles of the people in these regions have tied the hands and feet of the imperialists, especially the US imperialists.
    Djawoto said that the people have learned from personal experience that the nature of imperialism will never change. There is only one attitude towards imperialism, and that is to oppose it and fight it, otherwise they will be ruled by them and become their running dogs and accomplices. The people have also learned from personal experience that US imperialism is their common enemy and their number one public enemy.
    He said that the struggle of the Vietnamese people against US aggression shows us that US imperialism can and will be defeated. There is only one answer to US imperialist aggression and control: people's war. The Vietnamese people have taught us a very valuable lesson, that is, dare to fight and dare to win.
    He said that in the face of the attacks by the people of the three continents, imperialism headed by the United States and its running dogs are becoming more and more vicious and using very barbaric means. They are trying to achieve some successes here and there. This is the case in some African countries, and it is also the case in Indonesia recently. But this is a temporary phenomenon. The counter-revolutionary current is trying to overwhelm the mainstream of national independence, but it can never become the mainstream. The mainstream will continue to develop and eventually overwhelm the counter-revolutionary current.
    Djawoto said that the contradiction between the people of all countries and imperialism headed by the United States and its running dogs has become more acute. This is the case in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Indonesia, Ghana, Pakistan, the Federation of South Arabia, Palestine, Congo (Kinshasa), Azania, Zimbabwe and other places. Asian and African journalists must take a correct and fair stand on these urgent issues. The Asian-African Journalists Association, especially this enlarged meeting, will firmly support the just cause of the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America. The Asian-African Journalists Association will not hesitate or waver.
    Djawoto said that imperialism and its running dogs have set up many obstacles for us. One of them is: the recent atrocities and attacks by Indonesian reactionary forces against progressive Indonesian journalists and the Asian-African Journalists Association. This forced the Asian-African Journalists Association to temporarily move out of Jakarta. But the goal we are fighting for is noble. No matter how great the difficulties, we believe that as long as we are brave and determined, we can overcome them. After this meeting, the influence and strength of the Asian-African Journalists Association will be even stronger.
    In his speech, Vice Mayor Wan Li warmly wished the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association a successful plenary meeting on behalf of the people of Beijing and the Chinese people. He said that this meeting will not only strengthen the friendship between Asian and African journalists, but also help enhance the unity between the Asian and African people and contribute to the anti-imperialist cause of the world's people.
    Wan Li praised the Asian-African Journalists Association for holding high the revolutionary banner of opposing imperialism and new and old colonialism in the two years since its establishment, and for doing a lot of work and achieving great success in strengthening the fighting unity of the Asian and African people and journalists. He condemned the Indonesian right-wing forces for rudely interfering in the work of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association stationed in Jakarta, making it impossible for the Secretariat to carry out its work and forcing it to withdraw from Jakarta. He said that your work has not stopped because of this, and now you are holding the enlarged fourth plenary meeting of the Secretariat, which shows that your work has not been harmed as the imperialists and reactionaries had hoped, but has instead had new and greater development.
    Wan Li said that the fourth plenary meeting of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association is being held under the situation that the tide of the world's people's anti-imperialist struggle is surging and imperialism and new and old colonialism are facing increasing difficulties and are heading towards extinction. He pointed out that US imperialism is the number one enemy of the world's people, and the decadent forces of imperialism headed by it are full of difficulties and crises, and are carrying out a dying struggle. The drastic changes in the current international situation reflect the deepening of the world's people's revolutionary struggle, and people can look forward to a new, greater, and more intense anti-American revolutionary storm that is about to rise all over the world.
    Wan Li said that the Vietnamese people's struggle against US aggression and for national salvation is the focus of the current world people's anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle. The 14 million heroic South Vietnamese people, using the magic weapon of people's war, have beaten the US imperialism, which is armed to the teeth, into a state of disarray. It best proves that the truly powerful force is not the seemingly powerful US imperialism, but the people who are fighting for justice, national liberation and independence.
    Wan Li said that the Asian and African people, unafraid of violence, have followed one another in fighting imperialism and new and old colonialism headed by the United States, powerfully hitting and weakening the ruling foundation of imperialism. The Asian and African people are further strengthening and expanding the united front against US imperialism and its running dogs, putting US imperialism and its running dogs in a tight encirclement. The revolutionary tide of the Asian and African people against imperialism and new and old colonialism will eventually overwhelm the reactionary current set off by imperialism and its running dogs and surge forward.
    Wan Li condemned modern revisionism for acting as an accomplice of US imperialism in suppressing the national liberation movements in Asia and Africa. He said that modern revisionism, centered on the Soviet leadership group, verbally says "supporting the anti-imperialist struggle of the world's people," but in fact, not only does it not oppose US imperialism, but it also seeks cooperation with this most ferocious enemy of the world's people, helping US imperialism and its running dogs to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Asian and African people's movement. These people are accomplices of US imperialism in suppressing the national liberation movements in Asia and Africa, and are accomplices of imperialism against the world's people. We must oppose imperialism headed by the United States, and we cannot but expose and oppose its accomplices and accomplices. Their sinful acts of betraying the revolutionary cause of the world's people will inevitably be punished by history and end up in a shameful end.
    He said that the Asian and African progressive journalists, as the expression of the will of the Asian and African people, stand on the front line of the anti-imperialist struggle, using powerful pens to further mobilize the people to carry out unremitting struggles for national liberation and world peace. Your mission is glorious. You are fighting in the vast areas of Asia and Africa to spread the information of the people's struggle and expose the crimes of imperialism and its running dogs, and your struggle will surely produce fruitful results. Your work will surely achieve great victory.
    Wan Li said that the Chinese people have always supported the Asian and African people's struggle against imperialism and new and old colonialism, and regard the victory of the Asian and African people as their own victory. We firmly stand with the fighting Asian and African people and fight to the end to overthrow imperialism and new and old colonialism!
    The speeches of Djawoto and Wan Li were warmly applauded.
    Loch Ket, head of the Cambodian journalists delegation attending the meeting, read out a letter from Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk to the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association. Sihanouk pointed out in his letter, "The recent events in Indonesia do indeed make it feel impossible for your association to consider convening a full meeting in Jakarta." Sihanouk said, "I believe that in the current situation, a meeting between the Asian-African Journalists Association and the new Indonesian Journalists Association cannot reach any agreement."
    Sihanouk said, "I would like to inform you that the Cambodian journalists delegation will be happy to participate in the meeting to be held by the Asian-African Journalists Association."

    高举反帝斗争旗帜大力支持亚非拉民族解放运动
    亚非记协书记处全体会议在北京开幕
    查禾多总书记说亚非记协坚定支持各国人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗万里副市长说这次会议将增进亚非人民的团结，对世界人民的反帝事业作出贡献
    新华社二十日讯　亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议（扩大），今天在北京隆重开幕。
    亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多主持开幕式，并在会上致词。他强调说，这次会议的任务是，高举反帝斗争旗帜的亚非新闻工作者协会书记处，要把同帝国主义、特别是美帝国主义斗争的问题列入会议的第一项议程。我们要讨论如何更好地为各国人民的斗争作出贡献；我们今后的活动；书记处的工作地点和第二次亚非新闻工作者会议。这次会议将大力支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动，进一步揭露各国人民的敌人及其阴谋。
    北京市副市长万里应邀出席开幕式，并且讲了话。
    开幕式上还宣读了柬埔寨国家元首诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王致亚非新闻工作者协会的一封信。
    开幕式在下午四时举行。会场正中悬挂着亚非新闻工作者协会的会徽，会徽两旁竖立着参加会议的国家的旗帜。
    查禾多在讲话中说，由于我们同心协力，我们终于使亚非新闻工作者协会书记处的这次重要会议得以举行。仅仅这一点已经是一个成功了。我们大家都知道，亚非新闻工作者协会自从成立以来，一直是全世界上帝国主义和它们的走狗以及所有反动派，其中包括自吹自擂为进步分子和革命者的那些人的种种攻击和诽谤攻势的目标。可是这是我们必须感到庆幸的事。只要所有的反动派都仇视我们，我们就有足够的理由感到庆幸。他们越仇视越好。与此同时，亚非新闻工作者协会始终把它的力量和一切活动致力于亚非拉美为了完全的民族独立和革命的新闻工作而斗争的人民。我们一直是把我们的笔用于为人民的斗争造益。因此，亚非新闻工作者协会一直是，而且将继续受到同帝国主义和新老殖民主义而斗争的人民的爱戴，这是合乎逻辑的。因此，尽管各种反动派进行阻挠和破坏，我们仍然取得了越来越大的成就。
    他说，亚非新闻工作者协会书记处是在十分有利于各国人民反对帝国主义侵略和统治的斗争的时刻召开会议的。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动，特别是武装斗争，正在反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义战争、侵略、颠覆和控制的政策的斗争中空前高涨。当前世界的主要矛盾是被压迫人民和国家与帝国主义之间的矛盾，而这种主要矛盾又集中在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲。这些地区的人民斗争捆住了帝国主义者，尤其是美帝国主义者的手脚。
    查禾多说，人民根据亲身的体会已知道，帝国主义的本性是决不会改变的。对待帝国主义只有一种态度，那就是，反对它并同它进行斗争，不然就会被他们统治，成为他们的走狗和帮凶。人民根据亲身的体会也知道，美帝国主义是他们的共同敌人，是他们的头号公敌。
    他说，越南人民反对美国侵略的斗争向我们表明，美帝国主义是能够而且会被打败的。对于美帝国主义的侵略和控制，只有一个回答：人民战争。越南人民教给了我们十分宝贵的经验教训，那就是敢战敢胜。
    他说，在三大洲各国人民的打击面前，以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗愈来愈凶恶，使用十分野蛮的手段。他们设法在这里和那里取得一些成功。这就是非洲某些国家的情况，也是印度尼西亚最近的情况。可是这是暂时的现象。反革命逆流在试图压倒民族独立主流，可是它决不可能成为主流。主流将继续发展并最终冲垮反革命逆流。
    查禾多说，各国人民和以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗之间的矛盾更加尖锐了。这就是越南、柬埔寨、老挝、印度尼西亚、加纳、巴基斯坦、南阿拉伯联邦、巴勒斯坦、刚果（利）、阿扎尼亚、津巴布韦以及其他地方的情况。亚非新闻工作者必须对这些紧迫的问题采取正确和公正的立场。亚非新闻工作者协会，尤其是这次扩大会议将坚定地支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的正义事业。亚非新闻工作者协会将不会犹豫和动摇。
    查禾多说，帝国主义及其走狗为我们设置了许多障碍。其中之一是：印度尼西亚反动势力最近对印度尼西亚进步的新闻工作者和亚非新闻工作者协会进行的暴行和攻击。这迫使亚非新闻工作者协会暂时迁出雅加达。可是我们在为之而斗争的目标是崇高的。不论困难多大，我们相信，只要勇敢、坚决，我们就能够克服它。在这次会议后，亚非新闻工作者协会的影响和力量将更加壮大。
    万里副市长在讲话时代表北京市人民和中国人民热烈地预祝亚非新闻工作者协会书记处全体会议的成功。他说，这次会议不仅将加强亚非新闻工作者之间的友谊，而且将有助于增进亚非人民之间的团结，对世界人民的反帝事业作出贡献。
    万里赞扬亚非新闻工作者协会成立两年多来，高举反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的革命旗帜，为加强亚非人民和新闻工作者的战斗团结，作了很多工作，取得了很大的成就。他谴责印度尼西亚右派势力对驻在雅加达的亚非新闻工作者协会书记处的工作进行粗暴干涉，使书记处无法进行工作，被迫撤离了雅加达。他说，你们的工作并没有因此停止，现在又举行书记处扩大的第四次全体会议，这就说明你们的工作不仅没有象帝国主义和反动派所希望的那样遭到损害，反而有了新的更大的发展。
    万里说，亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议是在世界人民反帝斗争的浪潮汹涌澎湃，帝国主义和新老殖民主义日益困难并且正在走向灭亡的形势下举行的。他指出，美帝国主义是世界人民的头号公敌，以它为首的帝国主义腐朽势力困难重重、危机四伏，正在进行垂死的挣扎。当前国际形势的急剧变化，反映了世界人民的革命斗争更加深入，人们可以展望到一个新的、更大、更剧烈的反美革命风暴即将在全世界兴起。
    万里说，越南人民的抗美救国斗争是当前世界人民反帝革命斗争的焦点。一千四百万英雄的南越人民，运用人民战争的法宝，把武装到牙齿的美帝国主义打得狼狈不堪。它最好地证明了，真正有力量的不是貌似强大的美帝国主义，而是为正义、为民族解放和独立而战的人民。
    万里说，亚非人民不畏强暴，前赴后继同以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义进行斗争，有力地打击和削弱着帝国主义的统治基础。亚非人民正在进一步加强和扩大反对美帝国主义及其走狗的统一战线，使美帝国主义和它的走狗陷入重重包围之中。亚洲、非洲人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的革命浪潮，终将压倒帝国主义及其走狗所掀起的反动逆流，奔腾前进。
    万里谴责现代修正主义充当美帝国主义镇压亚非民族解放运动的帮凶。他说，以苏联领导集团为中心的现代修正主义口头上说什么“支持世界人民反帝斗争”，实际上，不仅不反对美帝国主义，而且同这个世界人民最凶恶的敌人谋求合作，帮助美帝国主义及其走狗扑灭亚非人民的革命运动烈火。这些人是美帝国主义镇压亚非民族解放运动的帮凶，是帝国主义反对世界人民的同谋者。我们要反对以美国为首的帝国主义，就不能不揭露和反对它的帮凶和同谋者。他们出卖世界人民革命事业的罪恶行为，必将遭到历史的惩罚，而落得可耻的下场。
    他说，作为亚非人民意志的表达者的亚非进步新闻工作者，站在反帝斗争的第一线，用有力的笔进一步动员人民为争取民族解放和世界和平进行不懈的战斗。你们的使命是光荣的。你们在亚洲和非洲广大地区为传播人民斗争的信息，揭露帝国主义及其走狗的罪恶进行着斗争，你们的斗争一定会产生丰硕的果实。你们的工作一定会取得巨大的胜利。
    万里说，中国人民一贯支持亚非人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争，把亚非人民的胜利当作自己的胜利。我们坚决同战斗的亚非人民站在一起，为打倒帝国主义和新老殖民主义而斗争到底！
    查禾多和万里的讲话受到热烈的鼓掌欢迎。
    出席会议的柬埔寨新闻工作者代表团团长罗杰多，在会上宣读了柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王给亚非新闻工作者协会书记处的一封信。西哈努克在信中指出，“最近在印度尼西亚发生的事件的确使人感到贵会不可能考虑在雅加达召开一次全会。”西哈努克说，“我认为，在目前情况下，亚非新闻工作者协会同新的印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会之间的会晤不可能达成任何协议。”
    西哈努克说，“我愿意通知您：柬埔寨新闻工作者代表团将很高兴地参加亚非新闻工作者协会将要举行的会议。”
    亚非新闻工作者协会书记处各国书记和应邀参加这次扩大会议的各国代表出席了会议。他们是：阿扎尼亚（即南非）的里·摩里逊，柬埔寨的罗杰多、布温，锡兰的德·曼努维拉、佩拉·穆尼蒂莱克、乌达亚达马，中国的梅益、李炳泉、杨翊，几内亚的巴瑞·阿卜杜拉耶，印度尼西亚的苏佩诺、苏约诺、陈辉杰，日本的小林雄一、杉山市平，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的姜相渭、洪淳达、洪铉钟，巴勒斯坦的艾哈迈德·阿巴斯、马津·班达克、加桑·卡纳法尼，叙利亚的阿·勒·阿布库斯，坦桑尼亚的彼得·卡吉萨、乔治·伍拉塔、姆旺坎姆丸，阿联的易卜拉欣·赛义德·巴西、穆罕默德·穆斯塔法·巴拉迪、穆尔西·沙菲·穆尔西，越南民主共和国的刘贵淇、裴廷计、黎思荣，越南南方的黄万里、陈文华，津巴布韦的唐·穆伍蒂、安德鲁·穆琴杰、约瑟夫·卡内梅亚等。
