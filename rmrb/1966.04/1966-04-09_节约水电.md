    Conserving Water and Electricity
    Someone went to sharpen a knife,
    Forgetting to turn off the light bulb,
    Gone for a quarter of an hour,
    Wasting electricity,
    The light bulb complains,
    “I need a rest.”
    Someone finishes washing their hands,
    And strides away,
    The faucet isn’t closed tightly,
    Good water flows everywhere,
    People see it,
    How can they not feel heartache!

### 节约水电

    节约水电
    有人去磨刀，
    忘记关灯泡，
    一去刻把钟，
    电力浪费掉，
    灯泡提意见，
    “我要休息了”。
    有人洗完手，
    扬长他就走，
    龙头没关紧，
    好水遍地流，
    叫人看在眼，
    怎不痛心头！
