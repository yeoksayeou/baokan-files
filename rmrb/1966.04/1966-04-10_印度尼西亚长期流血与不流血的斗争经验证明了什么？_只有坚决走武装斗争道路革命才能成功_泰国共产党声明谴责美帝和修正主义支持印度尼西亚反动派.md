    What Does Indonesia's Long History of Bloody and Bloodless Struggles Prove?
    Only by Resolutely Taking the Road of Armed Struggle Can the Revolution Succeed
    The Communist Party of Thailand's Statement Condemns U.S. Imperialism and Revisionism for Supporting Indonesian Reactionaries
    Xinhua News Agency, April 9th, Bangkok Dispatch: The Communist Party of Thailand issued a statement on March 28th, strongly condemning Indonesian reactionaries for colluding with U.S. imperialism to carry out bloody suppression of the Indonesian Communist Party and the Indonesian people, and exposing modern revisionism's cooperation with U.S. imperialism to slander and oppose the Indonesian people's revolution. The statement emphasized that only by resolutely carrying out armed struggle can the revolution succeed. The statement expressed firm support for the Indonesian people and the Indonesian Communist Party, and expressed firm belief that the Indonesian people's revolutionary struggle will surely achieve final victory. The full text of the statement is as follows:
    The Communist Party of Thailand has been closely concerned with and paying attention to the deteriorating situation in Indonesia, and now the truth has come to light.
    In September 1965, U.S. imperialism, through its Central Intelligence Agency, colluded with a section of reactionary Indonesian military officers to establish the so-called "Generals Council," plotting to overthrow the Indonesian government. After this conspiracy was exposed, Indonesian reactionaries used the "September 30th" incident as a pretext to destroy the Nasakom system, suppress and attack Indonesian revolutionary and progressive forces, first and foremost the Indonesian Communist Party. Indonesian reactionaries mobilized most of their armed forces to carry out bloody suppression of the Indonesian people and frenziedly persecute the Indonesian Communist Party. They changed Indonesia's progressive policies, pursuing reactionary, pro-U.S. imperialist, and treasonous policies aimed at extinguishing the flames of the Indonesian revolution.
    These atrocities of the Indonesian reactionaries have received full, open encouragement and support from U.S. imperialism, along with reactionaries from various countries, including the Thai reactionaries, and modern revisionists. On October 13th, the United Press International reported that U.S. "officials were pleased with the forceful actions taken by Nasution and the Army against the communists since September 30." On October 11th, Rahman, the prime minister of the reactionary government of "Malaysia," also claimed: "I am very pleased with the course of events now taking place in Indonesia... If (Indonesia) seeks help, I will certainly come." In Thailand, on October 13th, Thai reactionary Deputy Prime Minister Praphas Charusathien also said without concealment: "The Indonesian Army's search for communists is beneficial to anti-communist countries in Southeast Asia." In addition, Khrushchev revisionists also absurdly accused the Indonesian Communist Party of being "sectarian" and "dogmatic." On October 26th, *Pravda*, the organ of the Khrushchev revisionists, published an editorial saying: "A group of conspirators, including Indonesian officers led by Lieutenant Colonel Untung, were the active force trying to carry out a rebellion." It also said: "Marxism-Leninism is incompatible with political adventurism, putschism, and sectarianism." Another newspaper of the Khrushchev revisionists, *Izvestia*, also referred to Lieutenant Colonel Untung and Colonel Latief as rebels. This newspaper wrote: "Troops loyal to the military command were transferred from the provinces to quell the rebellion." "The remaining rebels have fled into the mountains." This newspaper described the "September 30th" movement as "reactionaries," and even said that it included communists. It wrote: The communist newspaper *Harian Rakjat* also said that the rebellion seemed to have the support of the people. Yugoslavia's Tito group also wanted Indonesian reactionaries to continue their offensive against the Indonesian Communist Party.
    From this, it can be seen that Indonesian reactionaries are cooperating with imperialism and reactionaries from various countries, as well as modern revisionists, to slander and oppose the Indonesian revolution.
    From the current Indonesian and international situation, we can see that wherever there is revolution, reactionaries there, together with imperialism, first and foremost U.S. imperialism, reactionaries from various countries, and modern revisionists, will immediately unite to slander, attack, and sabotage that revolution. Therefore, opposing domestic reactionaries is inseparable from opposing imperialism and reactionaries from various countries, as well as opposing modern revisionists.
    The reactionary forces launched white terror at a time when the Indonesian revolution was reaching its climax, when imperialism, first and foremost U.S. imperialism, and Indonesian reactionaries were at the end of their rope, increasingly losing the benefits they had gained through base and avaricious means and were at a loss, and when modern revisionists were being increasingly exposed and isolated. Their political weakness forced them to resort to bloody fascist means to sabotage the Indonesian revolution and suppress Indonesian patriotic democratic forces, first and foremost the Indonesian Communist Party, in order to maintain their illegal interests and turn Indonesia into a base for imperialism and colonialism to carry out control and aggression in Asia.
    However, the Indonesian people under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party will never abandon the correct revolutionary policies and revolutionary fruits they have exchanged for blood in a long and arduous struggle, nor will they kneel and surrender to the enemy, or allow the reactionaries to persecute and massacre them at will. As soon as the Indonesian reactionaries launched a frenzied offensive and barbaric persecution, the patriotic revolutionary forces of Indonesia bravely waged a tit-for-tat struggle and stubbornly persisted.
    The Indonesian people under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party have undergone many bloody tests and have rich revolutionary experience in a long and tortuous revolutionary process. The Madiun Affair of 1948 was a valuable lesson. At that time, Indonesian reactionaries also basely slandered and brutally killed many Indonesian communists and patriotic democrats. The Indonesian revolution has gone through peaceful stages and bloody stages. The revolution has turned from high tide to low tide, and from low tide to high tide. At the same time, the revolution is also developing step by step, and the revolutionary forces are growing stronger day by day. From the Indonesian long experience of bloody and bloodless struggles, we can see that only by resolutely taking the road of armed struggle can the revolution succeed.
    In Thailand, there was also limited democracy, which was later completely lost under fascist rule. Many revolutionaries and patriotic people have been arrested, imprisoned, severely tortured, and killed time and time again. Finally, we have discovered that without taking up arms, we can only be slaughtered, and only by taking up arms can we avoid sacrificing in vain. If we must kill, then we must pay blood debt with blood! When we hold the gun tightly in our hands, we will not only not be arbitrarily killed, but we can also stand up as a true person, and we can also defend the revolution and carry the revolution through to the end. The development of the revolutionary road in Asian, African, and Latin American countries ultimately depends on millions of armed people, adopting armed struggle to carry out violent revolution, until final victory is achieved.
    The current international situation has become unprecedentedly favorable to revolution and revolutionary war. The East wind has prevailed over the West wind. The revolutionary forces of the people of all countries are developing and growing stronger. In Asia, Africa, and Latin America—the regions where the various contradictions of the world are concentrated and the weakest links in imperialist rule—armed struggles are taking place in many places, and are increasingly spreading to every corner. The unsolvable internal contradictions of imperialism are becoming more serious day by day. U.S. imperialism, the head of the international reactionary forces, is also becoming more isolated day by day. It is everywhere at odds with the people. The forces it uses to wage modern warfare have been largely consumed in the wars of aggression it has launched, especially in South Vietnam. The American people's struggle for democracy, social progress, against wars of aggression, and against racial oppression is also rising to an unprecedented height. U.S. imperialism cannot suppress or stop this revolutionary upsurge. The agents of imperialism, the modern revisionists, are also being exposed and isolated. From the overall perspective, we can see that the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries, including the Thai and Indonesian people, although they will have to go through an arduous, tortuous, and long stage, the future of this struggle will be bright, and final victory will be achieved.
    The Communist Party of Thailand strongly condemns the Indonesian reactionaries for colluding with U.S. imperialism to carry out white terror in Indonesia and sabotage the Indonesian revolution. The Communist Party of Thailand clearly states that we and our people resolutely support the just struggle of the Indonesian people under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party to defend and uphold the revolution, oppose imperialism and neo-colonialism and old colonialism. We will take all possible practical actions to realize our support. At the same time, we also call on all progressive people and revolutionary forces in the world to take practical actions, under the possible conditions in various regions, to jointly and consistently support the just struggle of the Indonesian people.
    Victory belongs to the Indonesian Communist Party!
    Long live the Indonesian people's revolution!

### 印度尼西亚长期流血与不流血的斗争经验证明了什么？  只有坚决走武装斗争道路革命才能成功  泰国共产党声明谴责美帝和修正主义支持印度尼西亚反动派

    印度尼西亚长期流血与不流血的斗争经验证明了什么？
    只有坚决走武装斗争道路革命才能成功
    泰国共产党声明谴责美帝和修正主义支持印度尼西亚反动派
    新华社九日讯　曼谷消息：三月二十八日泰国共产党发表声明，强烈谴责印度尼西亚反动派勾结美帝国主义，对印度尼西亚共产党和人民进行血腥镇压，并揭露现代修正主义配合美帝国主义竭力诬蔑和反对印度尼西亚人民的革命。声明强调指出，只有坚决地进行武装斗争，革命才能成功。声明表示坚决支持印度尼西亚人民和印度尼西亚共产党，并表示坚信，印度尼西亚人民的革命斗争一定会取得最后胜利。声明全文如下：
    泰国共产党一直在密切地关心和注视着在印度尼西亚发生的恶劣局势，如今事情已经真相大白了。
    一九六五年九月，美帝国主义通过它的中央情报局，勾结印度尼西亚一部分反动军官，建立所谓“将领委员会”，图谋推翻印度尼西亚政府。他们的这一阴谋被揭露后，印度尼西亚反动派又借口“九月三十日”事件，破坏了纳沙贡体制，镇压和打击印度尼西亚革命进步力量，首先是印度尼西亚共产党。印度尼西亚反动派动用了大部分武装力量，对印度尼西亚人民进行了血腥的镇压，疯狂迫害印度尼西亚共产党。他们改变了印度尼西亚的进步政策，奉行反动的、为美帝国主义效劳的、旨在扑灭印度尼西亚革命烈火的叛国卖国政策。
    印度尼西亚反动派的这些暴行，得到了美帝国主义同包括泰国反动派在内的各国反动派、以及现代修正主义者的全力的、公开的怂恿和支持。十月十三日，美国合众国际社说：美国“官员们对纳苏蒂安和陆军从九月三十日以来对共产党分子采取的有力行动感到高兴。”十月十一日，“马来西亚”反动政府总理拉赫曼也声称：“我对印度尼西亚现在发生的事态进程感到非常高兴，……如果（印度尼西亚）寻求帮助，我一定来。”而在泰国，十月十三日，泰国反动政府副总理巴博也不加掩饰地说：“印度尼西亚陆军搜捕共产党，对东南亚的反共国家有利。”此外赫鲁晓夫修正主义者也荒谬地指责印度尼西亚共产党是“宗派主义”、“教条主义”。十月二十六日，赫鲁晓夫修正主义机关报《真理报》发表编辑部文章说：“一批包括以翁东中校为首的印度尼西亚军官在内的阴谋家，是试图进行叛乱的积极力量。”还说：“马克思列宁主义同政治冒险主义、盲动主义和宗派主义是格格不入的”。赫鲁晓夫修正主义的另一家报纸《消息报》也把翁东中校和拉蒂夫上校说成是叛乱者。这家报纸写道：“从省里调来了忠实于军事指挥部的部队平息了叛乱”。“残余的叛乱者已跑入山中”。这家报纸把“九月三十日”运动说成是“反动分子”，还说其中包括有共产党人。它写道：共产党机关报《人民日报》也说，似乎叛乱得到了人民的支持。南斯拉夫的铁托集团也要印度尼西亚反动派把向印度尼西亚共产党的进攻继续下去。
    由此可见，印度尼西亚反动派同帝国主义和各国反动派、以及现代修正主义者，正在互相配合，竭力诬蔑和反对印度尼西亚革命。
    从当前印度尼西亚和国际局势中，我们可以看到，那里有革命，那里的反动派同帝国主义，首先是美帝国主义、各国反动派、以及现代修正主义者，就会立刻联合起来，诬蔑、打击和破坏那里的革命。因此，反对国内反动派同反对帝国主义和各国反动派、以及反对现代修正主义者，三者是不可分开的。
    反动势力是在印度尼西亚革命走向高潮的时候，是在帝国主义，首先是美帝国主义和印度尼西亚反动派处于穷途末路，越来越多地丧失他们用卑劣的贪得无厌的手段得来的利益而束手无策的时候，是在现代修正主义者越来越被揭露和陷于孤立的时候发动白色恐怖的。他们在政治上的衰弱无力，迫使他们转而采取血腥的法西斯手段，来破坏印度尼西亚革命，镇压印度尼西亚爱国民主力量，首先是印度尼西亚共产党，以便维护他们的非法利益，把印度尼西亚变成帝国主义、殖民主义在亚洲进行控制和侵略的基地。
    但是，印度尼西亚共产党领导下的印度尼西亚人民，是绝不放弃他们在长期艰苦斗争中用鲜血换来的正确的革命政策和革命果实，也绝不会向敌人屈膝投降，或者让反动派肆意迫害屠杀的。印度尼西亚反动派一开始发动疯狂进攻和野蛮迫害，印度尼西亚的爱国革命力量就英勇地进行针锋相对的斗争，并且顽强地坚持下来。
    印度尼西亚共产党领导下的印度尼西亚人民，在长期曲折的革命过程中，经历了多次流血考验，有了丰富的革命经验。一九四八年的茉莉芬事件是一个宝贵的教训。当时印度尼西亚反动派也曾经卑鄙地诬蔑和残暴地杀害了许多印度尼西亚共产党人和爱国民主人士。印度尼西亚革命经过了和平的阶段，也经过了流血的阶段。革命从高潮转向低潮，又从低潮转向高潮。与此同时，革命也在一步一步往上发展，革命力量一天一天成长壮大。从印度尼西亚长期流血的与不流血的斗争经验中，我们可以看到，只有坚决地走武装斗争的道路，革命才能成功。
    在泰国也曾经有过有限的民主，后来在法西斯统治下也完全丧失了。许多革命者和爱国人民一次又一次地被逮捕、监禁、严刑拷打和杀害。最后，我们终于发现，不拿起武器，就只好任人屠杀，唯有拿起武器，才不会白白地牺牲，要杀吗，也得血债血还！当我们紧握手中枪，就不仅不会被人任意杀戮，而且还能作为一个真正的人站立起来，还能保卫革命，把革命胜利地进行到底。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国革命道路的开拓，归根结底还得由千百万武装了的人民群众，采取武装斗争的方式，实行暴力革命，直到取得最后胜利。
    目前的国际局势，已经变得空前有利于革命和革命战争。东风已经压倒西风。各国人民的革命力量正在发展壮大。在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲——这个世界各种矛盾集中的地区和帝国主义统治最薄弱的环节——许多地方正在发生武装斗争，而且日益蔓延到每个角落。帝国主义存在的无法解决的内部矛盾，一天比一天严重。国际反动势力的头子美帝国主义也一天比一天孤立。它到处与人民为敌。它用来进行现代战争的兵力，已经在它所发动的侵略战争中大量消耗了，特别是在越南南方。美国人民的争取民主、争取社会进步、反对侵略战争、反对种族压迫的斗争，也正在空前地高涨。美帝国主义是无法镇压和阻止这一革命高潮的。帝国主义的代理人、现代修正主义者也正在被揭露和孤立。从全局上看，可以看到，各国人民，包括泰国和印度尼西亚人民在内的革命斗争，虽然还要经过一个艰苦奋斗的、曲折而长期的阶段，但这个斗争的前途将是光明的，是一定会取得最后胜利的。
    泰国共产党强烈谴责印度尼西亚反动派勾结美帝国主义在印度尼西亚实行白色恐怖，破坏印度尼西亚的革命。泰国共产党明确声明，我们和我国人民坚决地支持印度尼西亚人民在印度尼西亚共产党领导下进行的保卫和坚持革命、反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的正义斗争。我们将采取一切可能的实际行动来实现我们的支持。同时我们还呼吁全世界一切进步人民和革命力量，在各地区的可能条件下，采取实际行动，共同一致支持印度尼西亚人民的正义斗争。
    胜利属于印度尼西亚共产党！
    印度尼西亚人民的革命万岁！
